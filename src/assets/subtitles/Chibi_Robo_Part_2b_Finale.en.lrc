[00:17.56]Hello?
[00:18.52]Hi.
[00:20.53]Uh, I changed Twitch servers.
[00:22.55]Let's see if that does anything.
[00:28.19]So the stream did turn off.
[00:31.93]Let's see if it continues to work.
[00:35.67]Went to a different server.
[00:42.43]Dude, two streams in one day?
[00:44.05]What the fuck?
[00:44.87]Are you serious?
[00:55.27]That seems fairly stable.
[00:56.91]Let's hope it stays that way.
[01:02.62]I think it's okay.
[01:03.24]Alright.
[01:08.29]Let's continue.
[01:11.99]I'll give it a minute or two for people to realize that we're live again.
[01:22.00]Remember, just got the notification you went live.
[01:23.46]Can't wait for another eight hours of Chibi-Robo!
[01:26.98]Alright!
[01:31.04]What happened?
[01:31.42]I just got back?
[01:33.18]Uh, the server I was connected to was kind of fucked up, I guess.
[01:39.85]I'm just gonna let it ride out for a minute.
[01:47.07]Did you play off stream?
[01:50.33]A little.
[01:50.98]Just a little.
[01:55.66]Just a little bit.
[02:00.00]Can we get a free wink for our troubles?
[02:04.83]Sure, why not?
[02:06.13]Where's the camera?
[02:07.09]There it is.
[02:11.45]I think we're good.
[02:12.11]I think this is solid.
[02:17.13]Stream might not even turn off.
[02:18.85]F.A.
[02:19.17]Lat.
[02:24.51]No drop frames?
[02:41.15]Alright, let's go!
[02:48.25]Where's that tuber light?
[02:56.09]Oh.
[02:56.41]Alright, so waterfall training?
[02:59.76]Yes, I want to do waterfall training.
[03:01.16]Of course I do.
[03:07.68]This will make your mind sharper than a dagger, and your body harder than steel.
[03:12.67]Listen up, I do not want to repeat myself.
[03:17.17]March straight down this way, soldier.
[03:18.79]You'll eventually reach the waterfall.
[03:32.74]Look at that guy up there having so much fun.
[03:34.76]When you get there, you'll have to climb to the top and meet up with Private Frisco.
[03:40.31]So just run over there.
[03:41.57]Let's go.
[03:42.85]Dude, you just peeked the mic.
[03:45.97]Easy.
[03:46.31]No, wrong item.
[04:12.37]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[04:14.97]Climb waterfall.
[04:16.15]No, you idiot.
[04:16.97]It's okay.
[04:17.27]Go like this.
[04:19.25]Put this shit away.
[04:20.03]Up.
[04:20.13]Alright, put it back up.
[04:28.06]Wait, are they firing at me?
[04:28.94]Can I climb the vine?
[04:32.60]Climb the vine.
[04:33.14]I can't climb vines?
[04:34.44]I can't climb the vine.
[04:51.80]Stop.
[04:53.18]Now what?
[04:54.88]Hello?
[04:55.86]What the fuck does he want me to do now?
[04:58.69]What the fuck is going on?
[04:59.69]That wasn't him?
[05:00.21]I'm out of battery.
[05:04.27]I'm dead.
[05:05.45]Oh my god.
[05:06.07]I blame the fucking internet on this bullshit.
[05:09.76]If I wasn't paying attention to the goddamn internet going down, this wouldn't have happened.
[05:15.32]I just used my battery.
[05:32.21]I'll be on Fiverr.
[05:34.31]Like, within the next 30 days.
[05:36.13]I can't fucking wait.
[05:38.19]So this shit is impossible to have it happen again.
[05:40.82]Ever.
[05:40.96]What a pain in the ass.
[05:43.88]Fiverr?
[05:44.08]I'm going on Fiverr.
[05:53.38]I just wasted the fucking battery.
[05:55.56]I'm going back to the save.
[05:58.44]Right?
[05:58.62]I didn't even need to use that battery.
[06:00.33]I got saved by the bell.
[06:06.57]Where was that last save?
[06:18.96]Did I not save after the...
[06:22.10]No save scumming?
[06:27.06]It was before the jungle part.
[06:31.91]Really?
[06:34.85]God damn it, really?
[06:36.01]Imagine save scumming in Chibi-Robo.
[06:54.21]Get me on that fucking fiber line, but never have to think about this shit literally ever again for the rest of my life.
[07:18.80]How much for a wink on Fiverr?
[07:20.39]Five dollars, man!
[07:21.57]Exactly five dollars.
[07:25.09]He thinks Fiverr is different.
[07:27.07]Well, when you have a thousand a thousand, there's a lot of leeway for you to not have to drop frames streaming at six up.
[07:36.24]If there's a thousand up, there's a lot more room.
[07:47.66]I'm just gonna save it Stop throwing shit at me!
[07:50.51]Who's doing this?
[08:19.04]Alright, I'm going back there and I'm doing this.
[08:22.12]I want to do it.
[08:25.20]It's television.
[08:26.18]It might be.
[08:39.05]Was there a wink?
[08:39.71]I didn't see one.
[08:48.24]Oh, there was a bunch of money.
[08:49.18]Sorry, it happened during the... ...during the internet bullshit.
[08:54.50]Uh, 5,000 bits came in.
[08:56.38]I missed it.
[08:58.73]Thank you for the $50, and it was from... uh... Sukhoi Flanker.
[09:05.99]Thank you, Flanker.
[09:07.91]Well, Jeremy, remember when you played Stalker two years ago?
[09:10.35]You gotta finish that.
[09:11.11]It's too good of a game to just forget.
[09:15.19]Oh, like stalkers.
[09:18.07]I think it's been too long.
[09:18.99]I apologize for that.
[09:25.96]I can't go back to my save from two years ago and be like, alright, let's go.
[09:29.74]That game's hard and unforgiving.
[09:32.56]I would have to redo the whole thing over again.
[09:34.33]I'd have to start it over.
[09:35.19]Which, I mean, that's fine.
[09:39.97]He hates good games.
[09:41.61]He's gonna do it again, he's gonna scream.
[09:44.70]What?! !
[10:12.22]Do it again.
[10:12.56]Do it again.
[10:12.96]Do it again.
[10:13.28]Do it again.
[10:13.62]I was trying to be cute.
[10:15.24]I was trying to be cute.
[10:16.14]I was trying to be cute.
[10:16.92]I was trying to be cute.
[10:17.64]I was trying to be cute.
[10:18.38]I should have just jumped up.
[10:19.12]I was trying to be cute.
[10:19.81]I was trying to be cute.
[10:20.79]I was trying to be cute.
[10:21.41]I was trying to be cute.
[10:22.15]No more cuteness.
[10:22.91]Let's go.
[10:23.39]CheapyRobo is not cute.
[10:25.09]He's cute, but he's not now.
[10:26.49]Let's go.
[10:37.87]Do an impression of Sarge Egg?
[10:39.11]I did one yesterday.
[10:41.95]I can't do another one right now.
[10:44.13]It would take like 10% of my soul to do it.
[10:48.66]You delete like a year off your life when you do a Sarge impression.
[10:56.24]It's like smoking eight packs of cigarettes.
[10:58.04]That's the toll it takes.
[11:01.94]Alright, don't shoot me.
[11:28.19]Watch out.
[11:29.17]Behind the waterfall.
[11:33.46]Climb it.
[11:36.24]Made it.
[11:48.72]Wow, I almost just fell off.
[11:49.96]Talk to him.
[11:52.12]Talk to him?
[12:02.64]Frog ring behind the waterfall.
[12:03.98]Thank you for your keen eyesight.
[12:06.68]Uh...
[12:21.83]Alright, got points.
[12:23.49]That's done.
[12:23.91]That only took... It took, like, 28 minutes to just do that one thing because of all the bullshit.
[12:31.45]Alright, now we can move on.
[12:32.87]We're gonna do the thing we came here to do.
[12:38.89]Talk to him again.
[12:42.01]More training to do.
[12:46.83]Look at the ring.
[12:48.47]Can I even get up there without, uh...
[12:52.37]Their help?
[12:53.49]I've never been up there before.
[13:01.14]What'd he say?
[13:05.26]More huge bits!
[13:08.26]From, uh, Sukhoi again.
[13:09.71]Flanker.
[13:10.07]$100 total.
[13:11.95]$10,000.
[13:11.97]That's right.
[13:12.37]$10,000.
[13:12.39]$100 total.
[13:13.59]From Flanker.
[13:14.93]Flanker35.
[13:23.48]This dude just paid me $100 to play Stalker.
[13:28.13]Hold on, let me read the message.
[13:29.31]It might not even say that.
[13:33.15]They say, you are at Dark Valley, but you need to complete Stalker.
[13:35.99]And if you do not, I will continue bugging you about it until the end of time.
[13:39.31]Because I need more Stalker content to watch.
[13:40.99]And I love you and especially your Stalker Let's Play.
[13:52.04]Alright.
[13:55.59]I have no plans to play Stalker.
[13:59.59]A Stalker dono.
[14:02.17]No, no, alright.
[14:04.27]I have no plans to play Stalker right now.
[14:08.33]I'm playing Mario Sunshine next week.
[14:11.25]That's going to take like four days.
[14:17.14]Play Stalker tomorrow.
[14:18.00]I'm not going to play Stalker tomorrow.
[14:23.01]I was so bad at S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
[14:24.71]I had no patience.
[14:26.13]I wasn't very good at it.
[14:27.59]That's not my game.
[14:30.15]You want me to play a game that was embarrassing when I was playing it?
[14:37.02]And yes, I know, I just failed Climb the Vine in Chibi-Robo four times.
[14:43.36]But there's a difference.
[14:50.01]There's a big difference.
[14:52.54]I wanna go to the- I wanna do the, uh, the bridge in the kitchen.
[15:11.99]Stalker after Mario Sunshine.
[15:13.67]No, I have- I have- I have no idea.
[15:19.74]last time I played stalker was it had to have been at least two years ago so you're saying that there's a chance well I'd say more like one in a million
[15:49.41]Dumb and Dumber.
[15:50.67]Alright, let's go.
[15:53.59]That's a classic line.
[16:15.11]What's this name?
[16:17.37]Jerma only eats beyond burgers.
[16:23.12]What the hell is your username?
[16:32.24]Alright, let me get over here.
[16:33.36]What is that name?
[16:35.78]Jerma only eats beyond burgers.
[16:39.17]Why?
[16:39.69]Why do you even have that name?
[16:41.17]That name is fucking crazy.
[16:43.11]Fuck.
[17:05.45]Sponsored content?
[17:06.57]Yeah, for him!
[17:07.21]Not for me!
[17:08.29]Oh, that's a lot of money.
[17:17.14]Alright, now, where do I want to put the bridge?
[17:19.54]Over this way.
[17:22.00]Look it up there.
[17:22.76]Oh, I want to clean the grill.
[17:26.22]Yep.
[17:26.74]Okay, wait, I want to clean the grill.
[17:28.50]I'm going down.
[17:31.67]Ah, the fan of the grill.
[17:34.37]Let me plug in.
[17:38.54]There's so much junk up in that van.
[17:40.84]Let's go!
[17:41.52]So much crap up in this van, I can't wait.
[18:10.41]Did I just get another 5,000 bits?
[18:11.67]Holy shit.
[18:12.31]From Flanker again.
[18:16.01]Flanker, this is $150.
[18:20.53]More than that.
[18:21.09]$200?
[18:23.13]Total?
[18:25.32]No, $150 in bits.
[18:25.80]My god.
[18:26.02]You're a madman.
[18:45.43]Jerma, you were doing really good for the point at which you were at the game.
[18:48.39]I want to see Stalker.
[18:49.35]I'm a Stalker fanatic, and I will not rest until you finish your Stalker Let's Play.
[18:54.43]I have nothing to say, except that you were doing much better than most other players.
[18:58.11]Are you serious?
[18:59.42]Wait, is this bait for me to do this?
[19:00.82]This is, that's bait.
[19:02.48]That's for me to go like, holy shit, I was doing better, and that's like a hard game.
[19:05.08]I'm doing better than players.
[19:05.92]I could do that.
[19:06.40]Nice strategy.
[19:14.03]Where's all the junk?
[19:15.95]Where's all the crap?
[19:16.83]I want to clean this.
[19:18.43]Why is this clean?
[19:19.40]I'm pissed off that this is clean.
[19:21.82]I came up here specifically to just get... Why is this clean?
[19:35.67]I said this last night.
[19:36.43]I'll say it again.
[19:38.29]I never rule out ever playing a video game.
[19:42.33]I don't have any plans for it.
[19:45.08]Who knows?
[19:46.11]You might see Stalker appear on this channel.
[19:49.11]Maybe.
[19:51.31]I refuse to say I will never play a single video game.
[19:54.43]Except for League of Legends, I will never do that, ever.
[19:56.19]Literally never, not one time on this stream.
[19:59.34]Or Dota.
[20:00.52]Will never happen.
[20:01.22]Not once.
[20:02.38]But I will never say that I won't play a game on this stream.
[20:10.19]I can't climb this?
[20:12.00]So, I don't know.
[20:14.86]I don't have a... It's not like, oh yeah, that game was terrible.
[20:21.56]I'm never playing it.
[20:22.40]I just kind of get distracted by other things.
[20:26.45]New games, something else happens.
[20:27.81]So you play something else, you get into something else, you forget about it, you lose track, you stop playing it.
[20:34.29]Who knows?
[20:34.65]We might come back to it.
[20:35.41]I don't know.
[20:40.61]What about Doki Doki Literature Club?
[20:44.50]Um... No, never. ...
[21:12.97]No, it's just not going to happen.
[21:13.88]I just know it's not.
[21:14.82]You know what I mean?
[21:15.60]I know it's not going to happen.
[21:19.88]Now, what else can I do with this?
[21:27.74]This can't be just to get across to there, right?
[21:32.47]There's got to be something else I can do with this.
[21:37.69]Oh, this is not even the bridge, Jeremy!
[21:39.67]This is not even the bridge!
[21:40.87]What?
[21:51.33]How much higher can I get this?
[21:53.85]All the way up.
[21:54.85]On top of the fridge.
[21:57.61]On top of the cabinets.
[21:58.45]Look at that.
[21:58.81]There's a demon door over there.
[22:00.61]Oh, yes.
[22:01.21]Come on.
[22:01.53]Keep going.
[22:02.73]I can shoot that.
[22:03.85]I can shoot that thing.
[22:10.93]Flanker gave more money.
[22:13.06]Now that's another 5,000 bits.
[22:15.38]That's $200 from Flanker.
[22:18.38]I don't want you to play Doki Doki Literature Club.
[22:21.83]I want you to finish Stalker.
[22:36.53]I know but I don't I just say yes, I can't I don't want anybody to think I'm gonna play stalker in like four days I Gotta be realistic with you guys.
[22:49.21]I need to move this forward You already took the money
[23:02.19]I didn't say, hey, I, hey, alright, hold on.
[23:04.95]I've got a defense mode shield going up.
[23:08.57]I never once said, please pay me the hundreds of dollars and I'll turn on stalker.
[23:15.82]That was not far of a conversation.
[23:24.76]You don't negotiate.
[23:44.23]He's face down in defense mode.
[23:51.64]I think Coolsville sucks.
[23:55.50]No, but I can't say yes.
[23:57.90]I don't know.
[23:59.44]It's not going to happen.
[24:01.18]I've got to be real.
[24:02.46]It's not going to happen anytime soon.
[24:04.78]Okay, that's it.
[24:08.30]Could this happen in the future?
[24:09.60]I don't know.
[24:10.12]But will it happen now?
[24:11.58]No, it will not.
[24:12.76]It will not.
[24:13.68]It will not.
[24:14.60]It's not going to happen anytime soon.
[24:16.00]It will not.
[24:16.90]I just need to be clear.
[24:17.84]I think I got a secret fucking entrance.
[24:37.55]Now, I also don't want to set the precedence of somebody paying a bunch of money and telling me that I'm going to play something and then I go, you sure?
[24:46.93]You bet you.
[24:48.94]I don't want people to think they need to or will spend a bunch of money to make me play something on stream.
[24:57.48]If you got recommendations, put it in the recommendation channel.
[25:03.71]I can't- I can't set the precedence of like, Alright, hey!
[25:06.65]Let's do S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
[25:07.51]tomorrow!
[25:07.97]Let's go, baby!
[25:10.47]It only costs $200 to make me play something!
[25:14.10]There's a bandage over here.
[25:25.70]Who's hurt?
[25:29.47]Lobbyists.
[25:30.43]Video game lobbyists.
[25:34.87]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[25:35.53]No, you know what I mean, though.
[25:38.64]Can I push this?
[25:55.77]I was told to come here for a stalker stream.
[25:57.35]Do you remember the stalker... I'm not going to read that out loud.
[26:12.59]But seriously, thanks for the ridiculous amount of money.
[26:17.15]You've given so much money.
[26:19.11]Too much money.
[26:28.14]Okay, there's another one over there.
[26:29.00]Alright, I gotta get back up there.
[26:30.56]Alright, back up to what I did, and I'm gonna go to get the other demon door.
[26:40.80]No, I'm not playing S.T.A.L.K.E.R.
[26:42.14]on March 13th.
[26:43.26]No, stop saying that!
[26:48.01]Looking forward to Lisa the Painful on the 20th.
[26:51.85]None of this is happening!
[26:53.05]You're gonna be very, very upset.
[27:07.73]It's only two... Lisa's the 20th.
[27:12.79]I... Okay, first of all, you know how that's bullshit?
[27:15.54]I'll tell you how you know that's bullshit.
[27:18.34]You think I plan out what game I'm playing that far in advance?
[27:22.82]That's... What?
[27:25.38]No, I figured out what I'm gonna play, like, two days ago.
[27:29.43]Like, I know what I'm gonna play tomorrow, today.
[27:42.18]I need 197 more.
[27:43.38]You told us you had 30 streams planned out.
[27:45.41]Well, no, I have 30 streams worth of GameCube, Wii, Xbox 360, and PC games back here.
[28:11.27]I don't know what order they're gonna be in.
[28:12.95]I just know they're gonna happen.

[33:25.34]I already know what the message is.
[33:40.64]You can't.
[33:42.72]Uh, Flanker.
[33:44.86]Insane.
[33:45.74]Insane money.
[33:47.38]Insane amount of money.
[33:48.74]This is completely... You don't need to do this.
[33:54.09]Unnecessary.
[33:54.81]Don't worry.
[33:55.57]Unnecessary.
[33:56.43]Thank you, though.
[33:58.37]Um... I don't want to set a precedent either.
[34:00.85]Right?
[34:03.23]You can finish Super Mario first.
[34:05.86]I just want to see Stalker finished.
[34:10.42]No, I- No!
[34:12.20]No!
[34:18.46]He's setting terms!
[34:19.43]I- There are no terms!
[34:21.31]There are no terms!
[34:31.41]I've been watching you since TF2.
[34:33.93]And I have to say, your playthrough up to that point was the most entertaining until it abruptly ended.
[34:46.89]Alright, I- Hold on.
[34:47.95]I got a question.
[34:49.23]This is a very- Okay, hold on.
[34:50.07]This is a very, very important question.
[34:54.42]Where- Where have you been for two and a half years?
[35:00.10]I'm- Why now?
[35:11.99]It's been a long time.
[35:13.53]I like completely forgot about that game.
[35:15.39]That's why this is so so hard for me He was waiting for the perfect moment So about this stalker stream
[35:39.21]I've already made my point.
[35:40.25]I've already made my case.
[35:42.48]You don't have to give any more money.
[35:44.26]In fact, you do not give any more money based on a stalker stream.
[35:50.62]I'm telling you.
[35:52.08]I really appreciate the huge fucking money.
[35:54.40]I really do.
[35:55.02]Thank you.
[35:55.36]It's ridiculous.
[35:56.12]It's a ridiculous amount of money to give anybody for any reason.
[36:02.75]I've taken your point, taken the feedback, and I missed a wink.
[36:07.27]No, I didn't.
[36:14.87]Pay him to play Sam and Max instead.
[36:22.02]Jenny said she's hungry, but I'm hungrier than she is.
[36:24.36]What the fuck are you, Dad?
[36:25.78]You get it?
[36:34.61]Come on, help me make some hamburgers.
[36:36.43]This cooking part of the stream.
[36:40.29]Of course I will.
[36:44.63]Oh, sweet.
[36:45.11]A zillion things.
[36:49.37]Every time I hit the kitchen, I end up burning everything.
[36:54.88]Let's grill some burgers.
[36:57.66]Okay, how do you cook burgers?
[37:06.34]Crepe work?
[37:12.11]Do I have to help?
[37:13.63]Set those buns on the plates.
[37:14.99]Why are you putting the bun on the grill?
[37:16.37]It didn't even get toasted yet.
[37:21.82]Keep it, Robo.
[37:22.26]It's on the plate.
[37:23.34]Yeah, I know.
[37:25.52]You gotta leave it on there for at least a few minutes.
[37:31.19]Is the stove even on, Dad?
[37:40.74]Dad, why can't you just put these on?
[37:44.66]Way to go, Chibi-Robo.
[37:45.56]There's no way I could... Next, we grill the meat.
[37:47.66]Okay.
[37:47.94]I gotta get my fucking secret sauce on there.
[37:58.71]Get your spoon out.
[38:03.67]Use your spoon to flip the patty.
[38:10.43]Alright.
[38:12.70]Why is there one painted on here?
[38:14.46]You have to label the burgers?
[38:17.86]One, two.
[38:18.58]Is it five?
[38:19.92]Cook until both sides are brown.
[38:22.82]They'll burn if you grill them too long.
[38:25.10]Why are there two and... Look for the three?
[38:29.07]Alright, that one's done.
[38:38.85]Three and three?
[38:42.17]Alright, three.
[38:44.21]Pick it up.
[38:50.34]Flip this fucker.
[38:51.46]Three.
[38:53.26]Alright, there's a- wait, there's a three.
[38:56.74]Come on.
[38:57.64]There's a three.
[39:15.73]Are they both free?
[39:17.77]Free?
[39:19.30]Two.
[39:19.68]Fuck.
[39:21.48]Oh fuck, I gotta get this over here.
[39:22.72]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[39:24.02]Don't burn, don't burn, don't burn, don't burn, burn, burn, burn, burn.
[39:26.48]I wonder if beef tastes good.
[39:29.06]I mean, it does.
[39:30.32]Alright, is this three?
[39:31.78]Put it back down.
[39:33.72]Is it three?
[39:36.72]It is.
[39:41.04]Oh my god, another hundred bucks just came in.
[39:42.87]Hold on a second.
[39:53.42]Flanker again.
[39:54.06]How much money is this?
[39:58.28]This is like $400 from flan- Hey, hey, hey!
[40:08.91]They say no pro- This is a hundred bucks, by the way.
[40:11.93]No problem, Jerma.
[40:12.75]I just love your videos, and I'm unfortunately broke right now.
[40:30.31]Don't give this channel money if you don't have any disposable, super disposable income.
[40:37.75]I gotta make that real clear.
[40:43.78]Don't make yourself broke.
[40:53.56]Here's the tier of when we should give this stream money.
[40:57.42]Okay, tier one.
[40:59.56]It's tier one.
[41:01.31]So, okay, all bills are paid.
[41:03.11]You've eaten three times today.
[41:06.61]You've got all your groceries paid.
[41:08.93]Your rent's paid, okay?
[41:12.48]You went to the arcade and blew $50 with your friends.
[41:15.34]Okay, good.
[41:16.38]Under that.
[41:18.16]Underneath that.
[41:22.79]Did you pay for Netflix this month?
[41:24.77]Okay, underneath that.
[41:28.67]I'll sit somewhere under there.
[41:32.70]Do not give this stream any fucking money.
[41:36.58]And I mean zero.
[41:38.80]Zero.
[41:40.60]If it's not something that you can absolutely afford.
[41:42.95]For the love of God, please.
[41:56.93]That's reverse psychology.
[41:58.79]I have to be clear on this.
[42:03.28]I don't want people to make themselves broke because they're throwing fucking hundreds of dollars at the channel.
[42:12.28]You know what I'm saying?
[42:13.70]That doesn't sit well with me.
[42:18.04]Anyway.
[42:23.78]Thank you for the huge money.
[42:26.39]Please take care of yourself first.
[42:27.67]Don't take care of me until you take care of yourself a thousand times first.
[42:40.71]It's a psychological mind game.
[42:43.31]No, it's just a reality game.
[42:52.47]Honey, Jenny, dinner!
[42:53.95]There's nothing on these?
[42:59.30]Oh, he didn't put the lettuce on?
[43:09.73]And you ban people from donating.
[43:12.01]I don't think so.
[43:13.59]I don't think you can.
[43:21.55]And his mom doesn't want any.
[43:22.83]What?
[43:25.60]Ribbit.
[43:26.88]It's more fun to eat together.
[43:29.52]Should I go deliver one?
[43:31.71]I guess we'll give her portion to tell.
[43:32.97]The dog gets a full cheeseburger.
[43:35.71]Oh, I forgot.
[43:42.85]Chibi-Robo and... Oh, we can't eat.
[43:46.06]We don't eat with robots.
[43:46.92]Oh, that's right.
[43:47.34]I forgot.
[43:47.68]Let's eat.
[44:02.45]One bite.
[44:03.71]Wait, wait a minute.
[44:05.29]It's... raw.
[44:17.27]You got the cooking sticker.
[44:18.65]Oh, nice.
[44:20.03]You really are amazing, Chibi-Robo.
[44:21.39]20 happy points.
[44:26.71]20 happy points, yeah.
[44:30.06]Howe gave you... Oh, the dog gave me happy points too.
[44:36.94]Nice.
[44:37.22]I think I did everything in the kitchen.
[44:45.62]Wait, no, the dog.
[44:46.24]The dog, the dog.
[44:49.00]Did I get all the things I wanted to get?
[44:50.64]Got that.
[44:52.00]Did the cooking thing.
[44:52.96]I did... How many doors are there in here?
[44:57.66]There's three more.
[44:58.50]Alright, I'm gonna do the beep beep boop boop thing.
[45:06.49]I'm up.
[45:08.31]Hold on.
[45:09.91]Uh, the crumbs there.
[45:13.45]Now clean the grill.
[45:16.69]Alright, where does this one want me to go?
[45:17.63]There's something apparently up there.
[45:19.29]I don't think I can get up there, can I?
[45:25.57]Maybe.
[45:25.83]Let's find out.
[45:27.63]Uh... Can I get up there?
[45:30.87]I was up at the... Oh yeah, I was up there earlier.
[45:32.31]I don't have the thing... Hey, Jerma, I'm doing huge out-of-the-money options trading to sub to you.
[45:44.38]Oh!
[45:51.80]That's risky.
[45:53.92]Very risky.
[45:58.96]Huge out of the money offense rating.
[46:06.66]I'm gonna plug in first.
[46:25.05]High risk, reward.
[46:26.29]High risk, reward.
[46:27.40]Don't, okay, don't listen to me when I do my joke streams about fucking stock trading.
[46:35.56]Don't be like me.
[46:40.29]More money.
[46:41.53]How much?
[46:41.85]$50?
[46:41.87]5,000 bits from Ice Likes Rice.
[46:45.07]50 bucks they say here from my SPY puts.
[46:49.61]What the fuck is going on?
[47:05.50]Look, mom, look what Jerma taught me about stocks.
[47:09.11]I didn't teach anything.
[47:11.17]I told you that I got fucking messed up from beyond burgers.
[47:17.17]I fucked it up big time.
[47:18.68]Don't listen to me.
[47:28.28]Alright, where's that radar?
[47:29.70]But thanks for the $50.
[47:30.38]Thanks for the $400 fucking dollars, Flanker.
[47:32.76]Thanks to everybody.
[47:33.62]Thank you.
[47:35.02]Don't trade options unless you know what the fuck you're doing.
[47:38.00]And I mean it.
[47:39.40]You need to know what the fuck you're doing.
[47:40.92]Don't just... Oh, you know what?
[47:42.42]I think... I think Tesla's gonna go down.
[47:44.99]I'm gonna put a bunch of fucking puts on it.
[47:49.17]Oh, my money's gone in less than three days.
[47:52.99]Oh, well, I learned a few things.
[48:11.90]Alright, what's up here?
[48:14.06]What should I invest my life savings into?
[48:18.32]I'm not gonna say a damn thing.
[48:27.19]What is this?
[48:40.26]Shoot it?
[48:42.12]What the fuck is this?
[48:43.32]Secret door.
[49:24.01]I know what's in my portfolio.
[49:26.03]That's a lot of money.
[49:36.58]Any more secrets?
[49:42.02]No, nothing else in here.
[49:42.82]I got all the... There's two more doors that I didn't get.
[49:50.79]What do you have in your portfolio?
[49:52.19]What wouldn't you like to know?
[49:53.35]I'll tell you.
[49:55.57]In my portfolio... Listen to me.
[50:01.36]McDonald's.
[50:03.68]Think that shit's going away anytime soon?
[50:05.98]McDonald's.
[50:18.29]That's pretty much it.
[50:20.99]98% of my portfolio is in McDonald's Limited Group.
[50:25.62]And then 2% into Waterstocks.
[50:28.60]Can I do this?
[50:44.68]I can.
[50:44.88]I just went right through it.
[50:56.13]Invest in water.
[51:01.03]Can I not do this thing?
[51:07.61]It don't work, guys.
[51:08.39]It don't work.
[51:08.93]It don't work.
[51:09.49]Alright, I'm out.
[51:10.58]Let's go to the next section.
[51:14.12]What do I want to do?
[51:16.30]What do I want to do?
[51:17.92]Climb up the jars.
[51:20.88]I can climb the jars?
[51:31.50]Stream is now out of sync.
[51:33.00]Shouldn't be.
[51:44.54]I gotta charge.
[51:45.32]I can't.
[51:47.27]I can't fuck around here.
[51:48.43]I gotta get up.
[51:53.13]It is.
[51:53.43]Okay.
[51:54.39]Okay.
[51:57.66]I can't climb up on these jars.
[51:58.90]What a lie.
[52:02.40]Okay, I gotta go.
[52:05.62]What do you mean it's out of sync?
[52:06.70]The game's out of sync?
[52:08.33]Video is slightly delayed after the audio.
[52:11.97]Okay.
[52:21.96]I'll leave this bit.
[52:28.96]How's that sound?
[52:30.66]Better?
[52:31.56]Oh my fucking god, I keep getting hit.
[52:41.13]Seems fine to me, okay.
[53:02.31]Alright.
[53:03.98]Now.
[53:05.78]Oh, dog!
[53:06.52]Right.
[53:06.74]I want to see what's wrong with dog.
[53:19.49]Sing for us, or else.
[53:36.88]What does it want?
[53:37.28]What do you want?
[53:37.70]What do you want?
[53:42.56]What do you want?
[53:45.74]Dog, what do you want from here?
[53:46.80]I can't do anything about this.
[53:56.53]Give the dog the bone?
[53:57.55]I can't even interact with the dog.
[54:06.98]Grain gang?
[54:07.80]No.
[54:10.57]No other secrets down here.
[54:14.27]Nope.
[54:18.09]I'm gonna clean up a little.
[54:23.08]Water in his bowl.
[54:26.70]Does that... Does that work?
[54:31.64]Did you give the dog the bone?
[54:33.54]I did not.
[54:34.56]Not yet.
[54:35.06]I haven't had an opportunity to.
[55:01.56]Alright, I'm gonna leave the kitchen.
[55:02.42]I feel like I've done a lot in the kitchen.
[55:09.08]Almost at 3,000 happy points.
[55:12.44]What is the next actual thing?
[55:15.24]Right?
[55:16.58]So I've got this bandage.
[55:19.51]Oh, and the shoe!
[55:20.69]Oh, I keep putting it off!
[55:22.11]I gotta do this.
[55:22.99]I gotta climb the castle.
[55:25.07]Alright, I gotta... Let's go.
[55:27.49]I keep getting sidetracked.
[55:39.58]Let's go.
[55:49.93]You know how some games have Twitch integration?
[55:51.73]I keep feeling like that is the Twitch integration of this game.
[55:58.96]You guys say a command enough times and it drops a fucking pan on me.
[56:11.93]Hand joke.
[56:12.55]It's getting old.
[56:14.47]Alright.
[56:16.60]Let's do it.
[56:21.76]It is in whose room?
[56:23.70]It's in her room.
[56:25.42]But let's do some happy points.
[56:32.63]Mm-hmm.
[56:38.69]Yay, Chibi.
[56:40.43]You're a great cook, Chibi.
[56:43.19]We're best friends.
[56:44.31]Oh, I mean, Ribbit.
[57:05.90]How do you earn sad points?
[57:07.56]There are no sad points in Chibi-Robo.
[57:09.68]This is a children's game.
[57:11.00]Bingo!
[57:12.12]Alright, I just thought I was going crazy.
[57:36.70]I looked over at the stream uptime and I saw 57 minutes and I was like, holy fuck, this is the longest hour ever.
[57:42.44]I forgot about the internet thing.
[57:43.78]40 happy points for that.
[57:51.22]Wait, wait, wait.
[57:51.78]There's a new picture?
[58:05.85]There is a new picture.
[58:06.51]Is it a clown?
[58:11.76]What is this?
[58:13.54]Explain this.
[58:14.86]Tell me what this is.
[58:15.38]It's mom and dad.
[58:17.12]It's mom angry.
[58:21.56]Jesus.
[58:37.26]Frog.
[58:37.58]I did.
[58:37.82]I already did.
[58:41.96]Sir, we have a problem.
[58:52.77]Report.
[58:53.13]Some men have gone AWOL.
[59:11.68]What?
[59:12.38]What?
[59:12.72]How could this be?
[59:13.42]Maybe it's all my fault.
[59:24.99]I'm sure I was tough on him.
[59:27.07]It was only because I didn't want to lose any more men.
[59:32.10]But all that did was make me lose him faster.
[59:38.68]That sounds pretty good.
[59:39.48]Right now.
[59:39.78]Wait, I thought this was your fault.
[60:26.19]I'm the bonus!
[60:27.62]How- I gotta be close!
[60:37.52]To another level up, right?
[60:39.74]More battery?
[60:40.56]Upgrade?
[60:44.62]Remember, there's an existential crisis going on right now.
[60:49.39]And these prints can wait.
[60:50.85]Well, yes, there is an existential crisis going on.
[61:04.01]Your happy point bonus is... 40.
[61:11.70]Why so many bonuses?
[61:12.54]Because I'm just doing so good.
[61:13.60]That was funny.
[61:14.10]I laughed.
[61:14.32]Alright, let's go.
[61:15.04]Let's do it.
[61:26.92]Let's have the cleaning robot solve everybody's problems.
[61:43.17]Oh, the day's gonna end.
[61:43.97]It's alright.
[61:46.47]He's laughing at his own joke, ResidentSleeper.
[61:52.71]When did I- what?
[61:53.77]When did I do that?
[62:09.69]Laughing at my own jokes?
[62:11.27]I don't do that.
[62:13.55]I'm not the first one to fucking laugh every time I say something.
[62:16.31]What are you talking about?
[62:17.29]I've never done that before.
[62:19.95]Like, it's not like you could literally put me in a room by myself and I would just entertain myself against, like, next to the wall for, like, four days straight.
[62:30.62]It'd be fine.
[62:33.02]Nothing wrong with me.
[62:36.67]No, no, that's nothing wrong with me.
[62:37.51]It's nothing wrong with you.
[62:48.11]Alright, day's gonna end.
[62:49.15]I might as well just let it play out.
[62:58.87]How crazy you are.
[62:59.89]Let me get some private Fargo reporting for duty.
[63:06.89]Hey, that's... That's what?
[63:13.31]What are they looking for?
[63:19.36]Dog tags?
[63:24.96]No.
[63:25.86]It can't be.
[63:28.22]Those are Memphis' dog tags!
[63:34.72]You infiltrated the Great Airy Monster's lair?
[63:41.29]Yep.
[63:49.85]Pipe down, what's going on here?
[63:55.98]Private Chibi-Robo infiltrated the beast's lair.
[63:59.26]And brought back Memphis' dog tags.
[64:02.94]What a bunch of hogwash.
[64:09.12]Doesn't he break?
[64:12.96]Let me see him.
[64:14.32]Memphis!
[64:19.74]I'm so sorry.
[64:20.50]I couldn't save you.
[64:21.50]I let you down.
[64:23.35]Forgive me, Memphis.
[64:40.68]We will never defeat the great fairy beast alone.
[64:52.57]We gotta pull together.
[64:54.91]Men.
[64:58.32]You're free rangers.
[64:59.58]You're hard-boiled.
[65:02.24]One for all.
[65:02.54]All for one.
[65:14.87]You guys are the best.
[65:21.85]We owe a lot to Memphis because of him.
[65:23.69]The Free Rangers will come back stronger than ever.
[65:25.75]Hold up for a second.
[65:31.60]What if Memphis is still alive?
[65:33.82]We gotta get cracking and resume our training.
[65:38.28]Go, go, go, go, go.
[65:42.67]Anything else?
[65:45.01]So you survived an operation into Tau's lair.
[65:47.69]For a scrawny housecleaning robot, you got a lot of guts.
[65:49.89]Bolts, too.
[65:52.39]You showed a lot of courage out there.
[65:53.67]That's why I'm asking you to do me a favor.
[65:56.13]Help instruct our anti-Tau training.
[66:00.02]Yes.
[66:00.28]I don't think there's time to do this today.
[66:02.60]With you on our side, we'll have some serious manpower.
[66:04.78]Here, I mean robo-power.
[66:07.18]Here, put this on.
[66:09.60]New costume.
[66:11.92]Tau's suit.
[66:14.66]It's a dog costume.
[66:16.20]Oh my god.
[66:17.02]This is so stupid.
[66:19.23]Slap me with a battleship.
[66:22.89]You're even more hideous than the real Tao.
[66:25.84]The other boys will crack when they see you.
[66:28.26]Head into the backyard.
[66:30.74]I don't have time for this.
[66:43.93]Listen carefully.
[66:45.55]We're going to start our Tau training.
[66:46.93]Okay.
[66:50.82]This training will help us withstand Tau's fearsome bark.
[66:54.76]Private Chibi-Robo, in this exercise you will play the role of Tau.
[66:59.16]Press Z to bark and scare all the soldiers.
[67:02.10]When your battery is below 31, you won't be able to bark and you'll fail.
[67:05.33]Do you understand?
[67:06.01]Do not waste your barks.
[67:08.25]Use them only when several soldiers are together.
[67:10.19]Okay.
[67:12.59]I think I got it.
[67:15.52]Let's go.
[67:47.12]I was trying to go fast.
[67:53.80]I was trying to go fast because the day was going to end.
[67:58.18]Well, I got the costume.
[68:06.04]This is just Sylvester from Looney Tunes.
[68:13.96]Alright, we gotta go talk to Mom?
[68:29.83]Bye, idiot.
[68:30.65]He was a cat, by the way.
[68:31.93]If that made you so mad, you're gonna just leave.
[68:44.29]That's funny.
[68:46.87]Back to the chibi house.
[68:47.79]Should I just dump all this into the giga robo thing?
[68:59.36]I'm gonna put all 3,000 into it, yeah.
[69:00.32]Can I rank up?
[69:00.74]Yes!
[69:13.79]260.
[69:13.85]Excellent.
[69:14.19]I need 730.
[69:15.73]That's a lot.
[69:16.17]I'm starting to get to the point where these are going to come fewer and far between.
[69:25.24]I'm going to do all 3,000.
[69:25.94]The whole thing.
[69:46.81]I do.
[69:48.63]One, two, three, bingo.
[69:49.88]More.
[69:50.08]More.
[69:50.24]Another one.
[69:50.62]This thing's getting kind of close.
[70:16.41]Is it four more?
[70:17.61]Four thousand more?
[70:18.27]Okay, cool.
[70:20.01]Welcome to the chibi PC!
[70:39.58]Basement warp.
[70:41.08]Anything else in here?
[70:44.71]Drama suit.
[70:46.55]Another battery.
[70:48.29]Space scrambler.
[70:49.46]A remote control space fighter.
[70:52.66]Perhaps you can use it someday.
[70:53.98]That's something... I don't have anything else to do.
[70:58.22]Alright, let's go.
[71:03.72]Now, my number one priority right now is to go climb the castle.
[71:09.04]I want to climb the castle right now.
[71:11.84]I'm not going to put it off anymore.
[71:13.54]I've been trying to do this for the last two and a half straight hours of the stream.
[71:18.52]We're going.
[71:22.28]No more putting it off.
[71:23.04]I need the D battery.
[71:27.04]I think it's over there.
[71:31.93]More like four hours.
[71:33.21]Probably.
[71:35.45]You're probably right.
[71:44.26]Jeremy, do you ever find it difficult to balance streaming and your personal life?
[71:47.34]No, not at all.
[71:48.98]Not at all.
[71:51.68]I take a lot of time off.
[71:54.50]The stream is only live about four times a week.
[71:57.09]So, I take plenty of time off.
[72:00.94]Because I have to.
[72:06.68]That's what I do.
[72:08.50]And that's how I do it.
[72:20.05]Leaving trash.
[72:20.93]I told you, that doesn't matter.
[72:22.91]I have one priority.
[72:25.37]And that's get to the top of the castle.
[72:33.53]But I do have, actually, I do have some trash.
[72:35.09]I have a lot of twig.
[72:51.76]Nice.
[72:54.62]I have a lot of shit in my inventory, huh?
[73:05.69]I missed old Jerma.
[73:08.13]Oh, old jermaOn Twitch who streamed six hours a week.
[73:13.31]Two or three days a week, yeah.
[73:15.06]I know.
[73:15.68]Why don't we get that guy back?
[73:21.64]Where's that guy?
[73:22.80]Can we get that guy back?
[73:27.18]I streamed like Overwatch like half the time.
[73:31.70]Alright, we're going up.
[73:37.49]I miss the old swindler Jerma.
[73:39.11]What do you mean swindler?
[73:40.55]What are you what?
[73:41.25]Get on his head Come on, please.
[73:45.92]Yes.
[73:46.62]Yes
[74:10.88]This used to be a mayonnaise stream.
[74:12.42]Now that's a true reference.
[74:16.00]Alright, we're gonna go up and to the left.
[74:22.49]I'm going this way.
[74:25.21]The battery goes on the right.
[74:27.01]I'm going over here.
[74:28.73]So, this door.
[74:29.83]Where do we go?
[74:31.13]Alright.
[74:32.05]We've got... Let's check it out.
[74:34.13]I could push this and go up, but I don't think there's... Okay, we're fine.
[74:40.84]Nothing up here.
[74:43.64]Wait a minute.
[74:43.98]There might be... Pull it.
[74:48.24]No, you dummy.
[74:49.13]I might be able to jump up.
[74:57.75]That looks like a D battery.
[74:59.65]That's a D battery.
[75:01.03]Okay, I know where it is.
[75:02.19]Can I climb from here?
[75:06.76]No.
[75:06.96]Okay, go back down.
[75:07.88]Okay.
[75:10.71]I'm going to run out of juice.
[75:17.13]I'm going to get an itchy nose.
[75:18.97]Oof.
[75:20.85]Okay.
[75:21.31]Can I... Can I make this?
[75:38.56]Holy fuck, that was just barely.
[75:41.86]Now... Can I knock this down?
[75:44.56]Give me that battery!
[75:53.06]Excuse me.
[76:01.18]Excuse me!
[76:05.12]Hey, get out of the way!
[76:06.94]I can't drag them.
[76:08.53]I have to drop down on it?
[76:10.83]What?
[76:16.92]Wait, hold on.
[76:17.48]Okay, I gotta... There's another battery?
[76:21.66]There's a battery here.
[76:24.20]Oh, fuck.
[76:24.58]Hold on.
[76:27.19]Can I, like, stick this up my nose for a second?
[76:30.69]You just astound me.
[76:33.05]The goal is within your reach.
[76:36.18]Go to the lovely Princess Fitz and deliver her red shoe.
[76:43.96]Um... I need to turn this on.
[76:52.59]This is where you insert a C battery.
[76:56.39]I have to get... Alright, I have the battery.
[76:58.99]I gotta get down.
[77:05.59]Where does this go?
[77:07.19]Okay, the middle door opened.
[77:08.33]Good.
[77:08.53]I have to charge.
[77:10.69]Yeah, we'll do this again in a minute.
[77:11.81]Hold on.
[77:19.21]Stick it in.
[77:24.12]Why are there so many kinds of batteries?
[77:25.84]Now you're asking the real questions.
[77:28.30]Thank you.
[77:30.10]You are actually asking questions that people have been wondering for decades.
[77:36.92]Why is there not just two or three types of batteries?
[77:38.78]Why is there like eight different batteries?
[77:40.32]Why can't there just be one type of battery?
[77:44.18]Why does it need to be triple A?
[77:45.64]Or double A?
[77:48.52]Why not just make them all small triple A's?
[77:51.54]Why have D batteries?
[77:52.52]Why not just make them double A's?
[78:02.46]Different voltages?
[78:04.02]Everything should be the same voltage.
[78:21.00]It's not that simple, I know.
[78:23.40]My god, he's a genius.
[78:24.58]Why didn't we think of that?
[78:25.60]This shit fucking slaps!
[78:31.27]I... Hold on, let me fix this.
[78:41.21]My Wii sensor bar just fell off the top of my monitor.
[78:43.71]Alright, they're moving good.
[79:09.34]Let me guess.
[79:10.24]It's a C. Check the TV.
[79:17.72]Uh, I will later.
[79:34.07]Please, Jerma, finish Super Mario Sunshine when you play it.
[79:36.38]I'm going to dedicate, like, a whole week to that game, so I definitely will.
[79:40.00]Okay.
[79:52.43]I'm assuming we're going to jump from one to the other.
[79:54.55]What's over there?
[79:59.85]Alright, come on, let's go.
[80:05.04]No, you idiot.
[80:10.71]I had it.
[80:11.29]I had it.
[80:11.61]I gotta wait.
[80:16.11]Can I get the cord out of the way?
[80:23.76]Alright, then around this way.
[80:38.85]You gonna play James Bond for GameCube?
[80:40.27]Oh, I don't have it.
[80:44.08]I don't have it.
[80:54.51]Um... Does he come all the way over?
[80:56.45]Yeah, he definitely comes.
[80:57.13]Just look at how slow this is.
[80:57.93]I get one opportunity right here.
[80:59.59]Go!
[81:08.13]And then we've got to wait until he goes all the way over to the right.
[81:11.93]Like this.
[81:12.39]Hooray.
[81:21.89]Okay, now... Shoot that from here?
[81:25.72]Good thing I just got the range upgrade.
[81:28.90]Good thing I got it.
[81:29.60]Because this probably would be impossible without it.
[81:31.24]This would have been impossible.
[81:36.54]Good thing I got it.
[81:42.42]Princess, I'm here with your shoe.
[81:43.99]Oh, my red shoe.
[81:54.92]Thank you.
[81:55.34]Thank you.
[82:21.52]Now I can go outside again.
[82:22.68]33 happy points.
[82:27.73]Mort gave you 33 happy points.
[82:30.25]Yeah.
[82:32.25]Now we can go back and talk to Mort.
[82:39.69]Let me introduce myself.
[82:40.59]I am Princess Pits.
[82:43.54]I don't know who you are, but you have my undying gratitude.
[82:45.80]I had already given up.
[82:49.22]I had resigned myself to spending the rest of my life in the castle.
[82:54.28]I mean, walking outside without my shoe?
[82:56.34]Please.
[82:57.44]That would be so icky.
[83:00.42]Anyway, thank you.
[83:00.97]If it isn't too much, would you be so kind as to tell me your name?
[83:10.01]Chibi-Robo.
[83:16.88]This is Chibi-Robo And my name is... This is the famous Chibi-Robo Telly Excuse me for asking this But you wouldn't happen to be the one who's been bringing me flowers Why yes, of course it's been me
[83:46.27]Uh, it's been... Wait, it's more, right?

[83:49.63]It's not me.
[83:52.53]No.
[83:56.72]I see.
[83:57.58]Then who could it be?
[83:58.98]Aha, a sweet damsel!
[84:04.44]Wait, it's not you.
[84:06.66]Drake Redcrest.
[84:09.43]Hello.

[84:38.64]Are you perhaps the one who's been bringing me flowers?
[84:43.76]Those filthy things?
[84:45.10]I think not.

[85:01.83]Mmm... Perhaps... Justice demands filthy flowers.
[85:11.36]Excuse me.
[85:15.86]I just thought he was a Chad.
[85:18.20]That was not a Chad move.
[85:23.84]Well, Princess Pits, if you'll excuse me.

[89:13.20]What?
[89:15.18]Barnyard.
[89:21.95]Yeah, this was a TV show.
[89:23.99]It wasn't a movie.
[89:24.79]It was a TV show before it was a movie.
[89:27.11]It was, right?
[89:30.23]It also had a Wii game.
[89:35.16]I gotta go all the way up.
[89:36.66]I was just up there, too.
[89:43.48]Barnyard movie came out first.
[89:46.16]Wait, the Barnyard?
[89:46.76]No, it didn't.
[89:47.12]It actually traumatized me, what you said.
[89:52.77]Wait, is that the one?
[89:53.39]There's like a pig in it.
[89:54.93]The pig talks like this?
[89:56.95]Hey, the pig talks like this.
[89:58.59]Welcome to the Barnyard.
[89:59.93]No, that's Toy Story.
[90:00.87]That's the pig from Toy Story.
[90:01.93]Is there a pig in that show?
[90:23.93]Yeah, there is.
[90:24.39]What does he talk like?
[90:34.51]Alright.
[90:35.49]It's... right here?
[90:37.14]Not quite.
[90:39.30]It's lower?
[90:41.14]Is it right here?
[90:57.56]Damn.
[90:58.02]Okay, let's go.
[91:15.08]Nice.
[91:15.38]How many more?
[91:16.30]Seven in here.
[91:18.25]Woo!
[91:19.32]Okay, so now we have to go use the radar, but look at all this stuff.
[91:25.44]There's lots of stuff in this room.
[91:26.86]Who's the dancing person?
[91:29.70]Purple crayon, zoom in on this.
[91:32.98]What the hell is going on?
[91:33.78]Okay, we're going up.
[91:47.30]It's a pirate.
[91:48.70]Oh, shit, you're right.
[91:52.12]Can I make it from here?
[91:52.94]Is this a snorkel?
[91:54.42]Can I make this?
[91:56.46]Oh.
[91:56.72]Oh.
[92:17.11]Why is chat in slow mode?
[92:18.83]There was so many people going like... I had to turn it on.
[92:23.94]Someone screams.
[92:25.48]Alright, I gotta get better perspective.
[92:30.00]I can probably get up there.
[92:34.00]I want that to the door.
[92:40.17]I'm gonna sit on the mushroom.
[92:41.43]I did already.
[92:47.89]Did I get it?
[92:54.59]Whatever.
[92:56.79]Let's go use the radar.
[92:57.93]Look at all this trash!
[93:00.86]Circle.
[93:01.32]Middle.
[93:01.80]Radar.
[93:02.24]Why does Jenny just throw all of her... mush all of her trash under the bed?
[93:15.53]Circle.
[93:15.91]Middle.
[93:16.23]Radar.
[93:21.30]Wait, is it her doing this, or is it the mummy guy down here doing this?
[93:25.38]Okay.
[93:41.72]Hey, let me, let's talk, I want to talk to you again.
[93:47.85]Oh, you're just, like, actually walking around?
[93:51.82]I gotta pee.
[93:53.26]It makes me upset.
[93:59.38]You ever in the middle of something and you just have to pee and it just makes you angry?
[94:02.42]Let me throw this away.
[94:18.33]Purple middle radar.
[94:20.96]Okay, I know.
[94:30.62]30 points.
[94:30.94]Wait, it's a toy telephone.
[94:36.78]You might be able to talk to someone, though.
[94:38.18]I can?
[94:40.00]No, I guess not.
[94:47.50]Alright, I'm going to leave here.
[94:48.54]I'm going to plug in.
[94:49.36]I'm going to circle middle radar.
[94:51.36]I'm going to talk to mom again.
[94:53.34]Go to the bathroom now.
[94:56.37]I'm alright.
[95:01.43]I'm okay.
[95:03.55]There's enough time for me to plug in.
[95:06.33]Talk to mom.
[95:10.14]And then go to the bathroom.
[95:20.86]Day's almost over anyways.
[95:21.78]There's a guy over here.
[95:27.66]Alright.
[95:28.14]A lot of things just opened up.
[95:29.38]Let's just go talk to Mom right now before time runs out.
[95:35.05]Use your Razer Gamer Diaper.
[95:39.77]Yeah, when it's full, you build XP.
[95:53.02]Noooooo!
[96:00.04]What level am I?
[96:00.72]26.
[96:01.22]XP boost.
[96:06.16]Yeah, you just gotta go get a Mountain Dew.
[96:14.02]Peel off the XP booster and punch it in the code in.
[96:17.12]It's 30% less urine you need to to level up.
[96:25.41]Of course it does.
[96:26.25]Do you have to even ask that question?
[96:27.85]Of course it does.
[96:29.55]Okay, let's go.
[99:24.08]See?
[99:24.18]We're right here.
[99:26.93]Quick.
[99:28.35]To the point.
[99:30.33]Right here.
[99:36.03]There.
[99:37.69]Here we are.
[99:41.17]Okay.
[99:43.15]So.
[99:43.97]What is the plan?
[99:46.09]I have a bandage.
[99:50.83]I have... I wanted to go talk to Mom.
[99:59.28]Congrats on being in BG3.
[100:03.52]What's BG3?
[100:04.10]Time to water the garden.
[100:08.89]Wait, what's Dad doing up there?
[100:17.88]Baldur's Gate 3?
[100:18.64]Huh?
[100:26.63]pg3 this okay dad let's do some lawn work
[100:59.16]I'll take care of this.
[101:08.12]Alright, let's start playing the Michael Myers theme song for a second.
[101:25.51]Wait, we wink?
[101:41.90]Okay, hey.
[101:42.50]Are you watering the tree?
[101:44.78]What is he wa- Dad, are you spraying down the swing?
[101:51.07]What's wrong with you?
[101:54.61]You're the neat freak, Chibi-Robo.
[101:57.33]I won't be using that toothbrush again.
[101:59.07]But if you're using it to clean, I'm fine with it.
[102:00.93]I'm watering the rocks.
[102:09.49]What a waste of water.
[102:13.09]I'm going to do my best with the chores until Jenny's mom is in a better mood.
[102:16.23]Why are you saying Jenny's mom?
[102:20.25]I'm counting on you, TV Robo.
[102:24.74]Can I do anything in here?
[102:47.07]Aha!
[102:55.65]Look at that!
[102:57.25]Secret door!
[103:18.36]Good.
[103:22.34]It's a translation issue?
[103:24.56]I guess so.
[103:24.98]Alright.
[103:27.76]Any more secrets out in the backyard?
[103:32.82]No.
[103:35.34]Can I do anything with dad?
[103:36.82]When I went all the way up to the top of the tree, there's...
[103:45.86]There's a fucking weirdo up there.
[103:47.96]Remove the weeds.
[103:49.36]Hell, there's a weirdo up there.
[103:52.34]How do you remove weeds?
[103:57.03]Dig?
[104:05.17]Hole?
[104:05.47]I mean, there's no... Hold on.
[104:10.82]Let me go look.
[104:11.26]I gotta talk to the weirdo.
[104:13.67]Give me a robo.
[104:15.25]If you stand there, you'll get all wet.
[104:19.25]That's dangerous business for a robot.
[104:22.91]Stand back.
[104:27.32]You're not my dad.
[104:29.40]You actually are not my dad.
[104:55.41]Alright, what's this weirdo doing up here?
[105:02.22]Shh, keep it down, will you?
[105:03.36]We're not supposed to be talking right now.
[105:06.20]I am Macon.
[105:07.66]I'm training to become a pirate, sir.
[105:09.12]Yar, sir.
[105:11.04]Watering the lawn is great.
[105:12.42]It's like I'm in a rain cloud.
[105:14.98]Hmm.
[105:16.64]Captain Plankbert is recruiting.
[105:18.88]Thanks for letting me know.
[105:21.68]Macon just gave you 26 happy points.
[105:26.56]Oh, you just have to tell them.
[105:34.14]Whoa.
[105:36.80]There's a door over there.
[105:37.68]Hold on.
[105:37.96]There's a door there.
[105:39.34]There's some shit over there.
[105:44.45]White block.
[105:47.41]I think I might need a tool to do that.
[105:58.15]Alright, you're saying pull weeds, so pull these.
[106:09.66]Can I pull these up?
[106:14.04]Weeds.
[106:15.00]Got it.
[106:15.24]Weeds.
[106:30.80]Oh.
[106:33.52]That's why everyone wanted me to pull up the weeds.
[106:36.91]Jerma, pull the weeds.
[106:38.29]No, Jerma, you can pull those weeds up, you know.
[106:40.31]Jerma, the weeds can be pulled, did you know?
[106:44.65]Cannot and today hot?
[106:48.41]What does it say?
[106:54.02]Cannot and today hot.
[107:00.99]It's been a while since I got any scrap.
[107:16.22]I was gonna say.
[107:33.90]So I gotta go here in nighttime.
[107:35.18]Okay, that makes sense.
[107:38.62]Now, what about over here?
[107:40.02]There's a little garden here.
[107:42.97]Can I plant the nectar flower?
[107:47.93]Here?
[107:55.35]Yes, I can.
[107:57.10]No, I can't.
[107:59.80]Plant the weed.
[108:07.03]I'm not gonna plant f***ing weeds.
[108:08.39]Alright, let's come back here at night.
[108:18.88]Got it.
[108:19.44]I got it immediately.
[108:20.30]Okay.
[108:27.32]I'll come back here at night.
[108:32.47]Oh wait, there is a bird up there!
[108:34.98]What does a bird eat?
[108:36.02]Bird seed?
[108:36.90]Do I have any food for the bird?
[108:40.17]Weeds, twigs, cookie crumbs.
[108:43.23]Bones.
[108:44.69]A cookie?
[108:47.69]The nectar?
[108:49.35]Nectar!
[108:52.23]Will the bird eat the nectar?
[108:59.46]Gunpowder.
[109:01.20]No, that's not gonna happen.
[109:02.38]Alright, yeah, let's feed the bird nectar.
[109:06.52]Gotcha.
[109:08.56]This game is so fun.
[109:10.08]I'm so glad I got this game.
[109:13.70]This is great.
[109:14.58]This is really great.
[109:15.77]I like this.
[109:35.95]Sure, we'll save it.
[109:43.02]You got, not bought.
[109:44.34]That's where you're wrong, sir, with the pirate emote.
[109:49.08]I did buy.
[109:49.56]I did bought.
[109:53.10]I do own.
[109:59.18]The ISO cost 100 bucks.
[110:00.75]No.
[110:01.25]I have the physical video game disk.
[110:05.11]Original.
[110:05.90]In circulation.
[110:07.52]I have it.
[110:08.10]I own it.
[110:08.62]And it's mine.
[110:10.18]In 30 years, I'm gonna sell it for 5 grand.
[110:22.16]I showed it yesterday.
[110:22.92]It's in the Wii right now.
[110:28.55]Did it come with a case?
[110:35.59]Yep.
[110:36.53]This is original.
[110:37.75]Original.
[110:38.39]It's got the manual, it's got the case, and it's got the disk.
[110:40.92]And the disk is in liquid pristine condition.
[110:46.58]It is like crystal.
[110:49.76]No marks, no nothing.
[110:51.18]It is pristine.
[110:53.44]I'm gonna shrink wrap this fucking thing.
[111:00.06]When I'm done completing this game, it's going back in the case and getting shrink wrapped.
[111:13.17]Let's give nectar to the bird.
[111:17.27]You're scamming.
[111:17.97]Scammering.
[111:18.47]No, I'm not going to tell... That's not the... Hold on.
[111:22.99]What do you got?
[111:25.31]Ooh.
[111:26.06]Chirp, chirp, chirp.
[111:26.74]Do I have to have a bird costume to speak bird?
[111:30.60]Chirp, chirp.
[111:33.42]Okay.
[111:34.20]I think he's half asleep.
[111:40.91]Chirp, chirp.
[111:42.79]Chirp.
[111:43.67]Chirp, chirp.
[112:04.18]Yikes, I overslept.
[112:05.36]Chirp.
[112:06.70]Phew, look at the time.
[112:07.65]I almost missed my date.
[112:10.07]Polly will peck my eyes out if I'm late.
[112:13.03]Last time she plucked all of my feathers.
[112:14.79]I had goosebumps for a week.
[112:17.68]Thanks for waking me up!
[112:18.78]Sure!
[112:28.87]You seem grateful.
[112:31.05]Way to go, Chibi-Robo.
[112:33.61]Now we can keep going.
[112:34.27]Oh, we can get on the roof!
[112:36.26]We can get on the roof.
[112:37.80]It's roof time.
[112:39.88]Careful.
[112:40.88]Demon door.
[112:41.40]Oh, yeah.
[112:46.79]Alright, anything else up here?
[112:48.25]Wait, let's break this.
[112:51.17]Two demon doors.
[112:51.97]There's a bunch of dirt up here.
[113:04.72]The bird shit?
[113:07.10]I'll get the bird shit in a minute, too.
[113:20.38]Don't clean, save the battery.
[113:21.60]Can I fix this somehow?
[113:26.58]Um... Can I get it to just jump?
[113:37.90]Hold on.
[113:38.34]Can I get across this?
[113:44.63]Oh boy.
[113:45.81]No!
[113:46.31]What just happened?
[113:50.51]What?
[113:50.99]I was trying to shimmy.
[113:52.12]What the fuck?
[113:53.00]The camera moved a little.
[113:56.80]The camera moved and... That was weird.
[114:01.12]Alright, hold on.
[114:01.74]Let me charge up again.
[114:08.43]Come on.
[114:16.98]So LOL bad.
[114:21.46]Oh, he's blaming the camera.
[114:22.68]Fucking the camera's fault.
[114:23.88]The camera sucks.
[114:26.92]Oh, I just wasn't expecting it.
[114:29.97]I was shimmying.
[114:38.93]Fake gamer.
[114:40.43]I'm not even a real gamer.
[114:42.51]I used to be.
[114:43.05]I was so good.
[114:43.77]Did you see my TF2 one-life gameplay when I got like 28 kills in one life?
[114:50.12]I used to be so good.
[114:53.54]I had like 37 kills in one life as a Demoman.
[114:56.50]Oh!
[115:03.19]You're just old now.
[115:03.85]That's what happens.
[115:06.69]Oh, but man.
[115:09.19]Back in the day.
[115:10.37]Oh, I'm so good.
[115:11.13]I'm going to walk behind him because I don't want that cutscene to trigger again.
[115:23.36]Oh, that's what happens when you beat Sekiro.
[115:25.14]When you beat the last boss in Sekiro, I'm doing that because I just want people to think I still kind of got it.
[115:31.74]What other purpose does that serve?
[115:33.70]I need you guys to know that I still kind of got it.
[115:45.04]And this game is like a hundred bucks on eBay.
[115:58.09]Well, just wait till you type in Cubivore.
[116:05.54]Check that one.
[116:08.94]I don't have that one.
[116:12.70]I do not have that one.
[116:32.92]You're back?
[116:35.68]Get out of the way!
[116:37.95]Oh, you again.
[116:40.03]I thought you died.
[116:40.81]I thought you fell off the roof there.
[116:43.17]Figured you'd never come back.
[116:45.53]You got anything to eat?
[116:51.69]Cookie crumbs.
[116:53.47]Now get out of the way.
[116:57.94]That's what I wanted to eat.
[117:03.32]Cat puke?
[117:05.78]A little one.
[117:09.02]I didn't mean them big.
[117:15.47]All these crumbs have made me thirsty.
[117:17.87]This is going to ruin my singing voice.
[117:20.23]Water's good, but I much prefer the sweet nectar of a flower.
[117:23.01]Alright, we have that.
[117:40.24]Let's just fall off again.
[117:41.00]Alright, let's not fuck this up again, please.
[117:54.05]Awful wink.
[117:54.63]Want a refund.
[117:56.09]There are no refunds.
[117:57.89]Okay, this is what happened last time.
[117:58.93]The camera went...
[118:17.44]Here we go.
[118:17.80]Oh, look at all these trinkets.
[118:30.80]Ten.
[118:33.40]Fifteen.
[118:34.12]Nice.
[118:43.60]I got to 75k.
[118:44.11]No way I'm gonna use it on a mere blink.
[118:55.49]2250.
[118:55.69]Alright, how many more?
[118:59.77]There's one more door out here.
[119:01.34]Isn't there one right here?
[119:04.60]Wish I could zoom out.
[119:05.28]Can I zoom out?
[119:07.40]Kind of.
[119:07.72]Not really.
[119:08.36]Where is it?
[119:08.72]It's like on the wall, right?
[119:15.77]Right here?
[119:17.69]Where is it?
[119:18.09]I remember seeing it.
[119:24.03]Is it right?
[119:25.33]Where is it?
[119:29.06]Whoa.
[119:36.18]Cube.
[119:37.28]White block.
[119:39.66]Got it.
[119:42.01]I know.
[119:42.31]Where is that other door?
[119:45.69]There it is.
[119:46.03]Okay, right there.
[119:47.25]I'm going to shimmy across.
[119:49.01]Drop.
[119:53.68]Of the dork variety.
[119:54.71]Okay, I got all the doors in the backyard.
[119:57.67]No more.
[120:30.64]Nice.
[120:33.48]Done.
[120:34.62]Eight out of eight.
[120:35.34]Completed.
[120:36.72]Backyard's pretty much done.
[120:39.10]Oh, I do want to get the bird nectar.
[120:40.48]We'll do that too.
[120:41.20]Let's close that out.
[120:48.56]These are the real gaming hours.
[120:52.15]Yeah, I guess so.
[120:58.59]Am I going for 100%?
[121:01.69]Um, yes, but not in the way you think.
[121:04.99]I'm going for 100% personal fulfillment.
[121:07.82]When I've had enough and I'm done and I want to complete, I'm going to complete.
[121:13.36]That's my 100%.
[121:13.96]That might mean do a shipload of side quests.
[121:18.86]Maybe not all of them, but enough of them.
[121:29.55]You sound like my youth pastor.
[121:35.66]It's a 100% happiness run.
[121:43.32]That's happened 14 times.
[121:44.68]Yes, it has.
[121:46.56]Can I get up there before the day is over?
[121:49.14]I'm gonna be close.
[121:58.18]Probably not.
[122:06.48]Hurry!
[122:07.82]Hurry!
[122:16.79]Chibi-Robo, get away from there!
[122:18.79]Sheep!
[122:19.17]Sheep!
[122:19.57]Sheep!
[122:19.77]Sheep!
[122:20.03]Sheep!
[122:20.39]Sheep!
[122:20.91]Sheep!
[122:21.13]Sheep!
[122:21.37]Sheep!
[122:36.03]I'm fine with you.
[122:44.14]We're so close!
[122:46.44]Stop!
[122:47.48]Get up!
[122:59.49]Go!
[123:03.93]Go!
[123:07.74]Nectar!
[123:09.50]Hey!
[123:10.08]Look what I got!
[123:16.23]Yay, nectar!
[123:18.59]Glug, glug, glug.
[123:21.36]That really hits the spot.
[123:22.22]I've been eating a lot of junk lately and need some veggies.
[123:24.46]Weed?
[123:24.60]Should I give him weeds?
[123:26.02]Counting on you to get me my veggie!
[123:53.89]I have weeds.
[124:00.28]Well, it's done.
[124:02.56]Have to do it again tomorrow.
[124:06.10]Maybe a twig?
[124:06.78]Maybe.
[124:17.11]Make him a Sisu salad.
[124:24.11]seed?
[124:25.41]Well, we'll find out.
[124:26.79]It's either weed, twig, or some kind of seed.
[124:31.75]Waiting for the countdown now.
[124:38.62]Ding.
[124:39.82]Hook him up with that connect, Jerva.
[124:44.84]I'm gonna get... I'm going for it. ...
[124:54.34]Birds eat sticks?
[124:55.30]Well, birds eat seeds and... I don't know.
[124:57.44]Leaves?
[124:57.64]Bugs?
[124:57.82]Birds don't eat sticks.
[125:00.40]Birds do not eat wood.
[125:01.14]They don't do that.
[125:01.88]I'm gonna save my money.
[125:26.62]There's only one thing I can buy.
[125:27.76]It's the spaceship.
[125:30.56]There's the basement warp.
[125:32.18]Warps you from place to place.
[125:33.34]Placed on both ends of the stairs.
[125:34.44]Yeah, I just get it.
[125:44.40]Woodpeckers don't eat wood.
[125:46.19]Yeah, I know.
[125:46.51]They're not eating it.
[125:47.61]They're burrowing.
[125:53.52]They're burrowing to eat bugs.
[125:56.02]They're making a hole so they can eat the bugs out of the hole that they're burrowing with their nose.
[125:59.10]They don't eat wood.
[126:00.74]UtilityBots just gave you 100 happy points because I did it all.
[126:20.34]You got the utility bot sticker.
[126:21.60]You really are amazing.
[126:24.68]You've done it all.
[126:25.94]You're the best.
[126:27.39]I actually need to look at the stickers.
[126:34.81]I haven't seen them.
[126:36.36]Scrap trade?
[126:38.38]Exchange rate.
[126:39.36]One scrap equals one... Oh, so now I've gotten to a point where I...
[126:47.19]The Space Scrambler and Chibi Battery.
[126:49.75]I'm not gonna buy either one of them.
[126:53.91]One like, one sub.
[126:58.49]One like.
[127:14.77]Alright.
[127:15.61]It's nighttime.
[127:16.23]You know what that means.
[127:18.75]Back outside.
[127:19.46]Do the radar.
[127:41.79]Is the bird there?
[127:42.39]The bird's sleeping at night?
[127:45.31]He's up there.
[127:45.81]Yeah, I'll do that after.
[127:47.85]Am I calling a UFO?
[128:48.98]Wait, they're all robots, they look just like me!
[128:50.74]I don't speak alien, I need an alien costume
[129:06.96]I don't know what they're saying.
[129:10.40]Oh, what?
[129:11.02]I don't know.
[129:11.41]Alien Council.
[129:15.89]Should I say yes?
[129:16.49]Yes.
[129:20.88]Yes.
[129:53.27]They asked you if you liked pineapple on pizza.
[129:57.55]Oh.
[129:59.47]Well.
[130:01.41]Was that... Was that you, Chibi-Robo?
[130:05.59]What do you mean, was that me?
[130:10.23]You're losing it, Chibi-Robo.
[130:11.71]I only asked you that to test you.
[130:13.25]Get a hold of yourself, bot.
[130:15.65]Those were aliens.
[130:17.13]I've seen them on TV, but this is the first time I've seen them in real life.
[130:23.97]They're smaller than I would have thought.
[130:31.83]And they were very shiny.
[130:33.85]But their voices were so quiet I couldn't make out what they were saying at all.
[130:37.19]Oh, I know.
[130:40.36]I'll ask Citrusoft if they have a chip that can help you hear their voices.
[130:46.40]Well, they're gone.
[130:47.56]They've left.
[130:48.16]Maybe Citrusoft can give us something.
[130:55.03]Okay.
[130:57.95]Um... Now what?
[131:06.33]I have a bandage, the bone, the weed, the bird.
[131:11.92]Is he sleeping?
[131:17.86]I'll wake him up and feed him.
[131:27.71]First thing I see in chat is what I'm going to eat tonight for food.
[131:35.14]The horse.
[131:38.80]Is it an egg?
[131:39.72]No, no.
[131:40.78]No, I don't think so.
[131:41.58]It was eggs.
[131:44.70]But I really don't want to eat eggs.
[132:03.98]Hey, I'm back.
[132:10.64]Don't you have a way to speak to animals?
[132:15.43]Wait, this is the way to talk to all animals.
[132:18.99]So why is the frog suit just frog?
[132:20.73]I need a vegetable that's super duper nutritious.
[132:28.08]It might be pretty tough to find one.
[132:30.08]But I'm sure there's one nearby.
[132:40.44]Okay, I need one that's super nutritious.
[132:42.16]It might be pretty tough to find one.
[132:44.62]I'm sure there's one nearby.
[132:45.76]I don't have it.
[133:07.28]Eggplant?
[133:07.50]Eggplant?
[133:07.96]Where's there an eggplant?
[133:08.80]What about over here?
[133:09.32]I'm gonna sneeze.
[133:09.86]Your head.
[133:10.16]Nutritious.
[133:10.50]Eggplant.
[133:42.92]There ain't nothing here.
[133:54.09]You just blew snot on your thousand dollar mic.
[134:04.11]Wait, hold on.
[134:04.77]There's a spot up here.
[134:06.50]Remember I was trying to figure out what the hell to do with it?
[134:11.04]I mean, this might be a shot in the dark or whatever.
[134:21.45]There was a little patch.
[134:26.43]Somewhere over here, right?
[134:27.22]Where is it?
[134:29.66]Up and to the right.
[134:30.22]There's a little spot.
[134:36.10]Where is it?
[134:36.50]Am I crazy?
[134:38.64]I think I'm... Yeah, I'm crazy.
[134:40.16]No, I'm not.
[134:40.68]It's over here, right?
[134:45.89]It's right there, right there.
[134:46.53]Yeah, I know.
[134:46.91]I'm not crazy.
[134:54.71]What the hell is this?
[134:56.21]There's nothing... I really can't get in here.
[135:27.86]No, maybe not.
[135:28.58]Eh, I guess it's not.
[135:34.32]Hmm.
[135:36.72]Oh well.
[135:42.67]This has to be here for a reason though, right?
[135:49.44]What else would this be here for?
[135:55.64]Oh well, okay.
[135:56.25]I'll just come back later.
[135:58.37]Let's move.
[135:59.05]The next order of business is... Um...
[136:20.84]What is the next order of business?
[136:31.80]Go back to the... and get the chip?
[136:34.51]I think I didn't spend any money.
[136:38.41]Alright, can I talk to the dog?
[136:42.79]I can talk to the dog with this on.
[136:45.95]Let me go see if there's a new chip.
[136:58.25]I could hardly believe my eyeballs when I saw those aliens.
[137:00.33]Shocking.
[137:00.77]Simply shocking.
[137:02.23]I couldn't quite figure out what they were saying.
[137:03.71]They were speaking so softly.
[137:05.03]Almost forgot.
[137:08.07]I think Citrusoft makes a chip that would allow you to hear soft voices.
[137:11.19]I'll contact them right away.
[137:17.69]I knew they had something like this.
[137:18.71]It's called an alien ear chip.
[137:21.85]Do they know?
[137:25.48]How much is it?
[137:25.90]Okay, we'll bring it back.
[137:27.28]Alright, let's go.
[137:28.18]That can't be more than like 2,000.
[137:30.02]2,150.
[137:30.06]Alien ear chip.
[137:30.53]Mine.
[137:59.84]So let's go back out there and do it again.
[138:01.10]Maybe I can actually hear them this time.
[138:09.74]Maybe if I, uh... Maybe the first thing in chat that's not an egg is a food item I'm gonna eat.
[138:14.44]Pizza.
[138:21.73]Okay.
[138:22.97]Thanks for playing.
[138:31.65]it was pizza I said hash house at gogo yeah and you are one of the smartest people in this whole room
[138:54.64]You have to be.
[138:56.14]You have to be one of the smartest people in this whole chatroom.
[138:59.62]Absolutely.
[139:00.24]1000% positive.
[139:06.35]Alright, let's go.
[139:06.89]I have the chip installed.
[139:07.69]Let's see if we can do this again.
[139:18.95]Oh, so we're stupid.
[139:20.75]No, I just said that that person was one of the smartest people in the room.
[139:25.85]Look, if somebody was in this room right now and had 155 IQ, I'd be like, you're smarter than me, but I'm smart.
[139:32.04]Like, if I have 140, that doesn't make me stupid, that doesn't make you the smartest person in the room.
[139:37.48]Why are the frogs back?
[139:38.22]Oh, fuck, I have to talk to them with the frog suit.
[139:48.37]Thank you so much.
[139:54.63]Long time no see, Chibi-Robo.
[139:57.25]Can I ask you something, Ribbit?
[140:00.07]It's been so dry here lately.
[140:02.03]If this keeps up, our minds and bodies will shrivel up like disgusting prunes.
[140:06.09]Well, you weren't out here when Dad was spraying water and making giant puddles everywhere in mud.
[140:10.33]This was over the last full day.
[140:14.66]We need to stay moist.
[140:15.48]It's the frog way.
[140:17.42]We used to bring the rain with a rain ritual.
[140:20.76]But now there are only two of us and we need three frogs to do it.
[140:25.10]Can you help us with our rain wick?
[140:26.74]Yes, of course.
[140:28.52]I would be honored.
[140:29.70]Let's do it.
[140:34.07]The rules aren't easy.
[140:34.95]Adjust your timing so that you crouch at the same time as us with Z. Watch our movements carefully and get the timing right.
[140:44.20]Let's go.
[140:51.82]We're doing it right now?
[140:55.31]Wrong.
[140:55.67]Wait, I don't... When we crouch together, press Z at the same time.
[140:58.74]Fuck!
[140:58.84]Fuck.
[141:24.06]Oh, God!
[141:25.98]Well, he's fucking up too.
[141:27.28]Don't get mad at me.
[141:28.58]He did it.
[141:29.24]You did it before, alone.
[141:31.02]So why are you only mad at me?
[141:45.02]I love the sounds.
[141:46.40]They're so good.
[141:51.95]A healthy snack gonna grow from that garden?
[141:56.60]Yay, rain!
[141:59.16]Thank you, Chibi-Robo.
[142:01.36]You are so welcome.
[142:03.84]It's not only just for frogs.
[142:06.42]I bet the flowers are happy too.
[142:07.84]100 happy points.
[142:17.08]We got the frog sticker!
[142:21.27]Their whole arc has been completed.
[142:25.95]Frog arc complete.
[142:30.10]Now, I think there might be a healthy snack over there.
[142:34.94]Let's go look at the stickers.
[142:40.20]There's one right here.
[142:40.74]Frog.
[142:41.10]Cool.
[142:43.14]Alright.
[142:45.93]What was I doing here?
[142:48.63]Oh yeah, this.
[142:55.72]Alright, come back.
[142:57.51]Come back so I can actually understand you.
[143:04.25]Oh, it's daytime, isn't it?
[143:05.67]It's technically the morning.
[143:07.19]Wait, is it because of the suit?
[143:10.56]That's because it wasn't the... I had the frog suit on.
[143:26.94]We're back.
[143:39.17]Aliens.
[143:39.89]Wow, wow, wow.
[143:40.83]This is the first time I've seen one in real life.
[143:45.49]We are aliens.
[143:48.19]We are here to see friend.
[143:50.19]We made promise to friend.
[143:53.01]Must see now.
[143:54.01]Are you friend of friend?
[143:57.04]Where is friend now?
[143:58.00]Are they talking about... They're talking about Gigachad.
[144:05.65]Chibi-Robo.
[144:06.53]Let's show them the way to their friend.
[144:08.91]Yes.
[144:09.17]Way to go, Chibi-Robo.
[144:14.63]Keep this up and we'll be at the top of the Chibi-Robo rankings.
[144:17.41]Do your best.
[144:20.27]Alright, everybody get inside my head for a little bit.
[144:23.71]You watch ship.
[144:29.01]We follow you.
[144:29.69]Thank you.
[144:30.31]So stingy on the, uh, happy points.
[144:40.12]Lowe just gave you six.
[144:42.98]Ganymede just gave you six.
[144:44.58]They're all Jupiter moons.
[144:57.06]Wow, wow, wow, Chibi-Robo, the aliens gave you happy points.
[145:02.08]Titan.
[145:02.66]Titan.
[145:04.42]Low, low.
[145:06.54]Ganymede.
[145:07.14]Ganymede.
[145:09.02]Nice to meet ya.
[145:10.04]Nice to meet ya.
[145:10.99]Alright, no.
[145:13.59]Wait, I'm bringing them through the house.
[145:16.97]Guys, this is not really how this works.
[145:18.99]Usually how this works is you get inside my head.
[145:20.71]Alright, we gotta go.
[145:22.97]What if the dog kills them?
[145:28.04]Alright, follow me.
[145:30.94]Wait just a minute!
[145:34.84]Who decides what is justice and what is evil?
[145:40.55]What is justice?
[145:41.91]What is evil?
[145:43.53]I don't know.
[145:45.43]You cannot fool me, disguising yourselves as Space Hunter Robo.
[145:50.25]I know you've come to annihilate this world.
[145:54.23]Hideous extraterrestrial friends.
[145:56.93]I must stop you somehow.
[145:58.17]Space Hunter Robo, I don't want to believe that you're an agent of evil.
[146:07.74]However, if evil exists, justice will defeat it.
[146:11.52]That is what justice is all about.
[146:12.96]And I am the hero of justice.
[146:24.04]Alright, push him into the beam.
[146:26.14]Space Hunter Drake Redcrest!
[146:29.19]Hmm, that a gas.
[146:39.53]That a gas.
[146:43.36]Humiliation is a cruel mistress.
[146:46.26]I seem to have run out of gunpowder.
[146:48.22]I'll let you go.
[146:53.45]Good day is another.
[146:55.57]Adios.
[146:58.71]I have that.
[147:02.43]What was that?
[147:02.91]That was cool.
[147:05.03]Alien is amigo.
[147:06.58]Want to meet amigo.
[147:09.54]Let's go.
[147:17.58]Break red cringe.
[147:19.21]Alright, we need to go to the basement.
[147:24.60]Basement.
[147:25.28]Basement.
[147:25.70]The quickest way to the basement is... foyer.
[147:29.18]We gotta watch out for the dog.
[147:31.66]Follow me.
[147:33.36]And if you see any trash, pick it up.
[147:34.51]That's what we do over here.
[147:36.09]That's what we do on Earth.
[147:37.05]He looks so happy when I pick him up.
[147:50.45]Do they do a jumping Jack?
[147:55.98]Just me and the boys.
[148:05.47]Shadow clones.
[148:06.35]Okay, voyeur.
[148:08.27]But what about the... Are we going to get attacked by the eggs?
[148:11.31]Let's go.
[148:14.65]Come this way.
[148:16.00]Let's avoid a conflict here.
[148:29.33]I wanted to pick this up, but I was gonna hang out for a minute.
[148:32.23]Come take a seat.
[148:36.25]Come, see your friend.
[148:37.29]Maybe- Hey, wait, can you- Can you- Does your ship have 4,000 power by any chance?
[148:41.60]I just went to the kitchen.
[148:59.09]Oh, you sure don't?
[149:00.09]I thought you knew where you were going.
[149:03.77]TB Robot, why is the GPS turned on?
[149:06.75]You've been down this road 2,000 times.
[149:09.37]I know, I know.
[149:10.31]Shut up.
[149:11.16]Let's fucking have it on, alright?
[149:21.28]Oh, look.
[149:22.18]Wait, don't touch that.
[149:32.73]Look who I got.
[149:44.63]Okay, so you ain't the fighting kind of alien, okay?
[149:48.10]Good.
[149:52.44]You're the exploration aliens.
[149:53.98]I couldn't have gotten one group of fighting aliens.
[150:01.82]Friend.
[150:03.50]Al!
[150:04.70]Buddy!
[150:05.14]Uh, he's dead.
[150:10.22]I forgot to mention that.
[150:11.58]He died, like, 30 years ago.
[150:14.14]Should I have told him that before we came down here?
[150:17.74]Thank you.
[150:19.78]Thank you.
[150:20.21]33, 33.
[150:20.25]99 points.
[150:35.61]Your achievements are already on a universal scale.
[150:40.67]We came to fulfill our promise.
[150:48.91]What did you do to our friend?
[150:51.01]Friend?
[150:52.08]Yeah, I'm working on that.
[150:55.50]I'm working on putting them back together.
[150:58.40]It's been slow going.
[151:03.18]You see, there's a divorce going on.
[151:06.48]I know there's intergalactic shit going on, but there's a frog girl up there I had to give rings for.
[151:10.88]It's been a long process.
[151:14.34]What we are the raucous.
[151:18.97]Ally immobile.
[151:21.49]Is savior sick?
[151:23.97]Is mate cold?

[151:50.43]We promised, friend.
[151:56.47]We are too late.
[152:00.57]We are sorry, friend.
[152:06.37]No good.
[152:06.89]This is sad.
[152:18.66]Are ye all grieving for me, shipmate Gigarobo?
[152:23.49]What a kindly bunch of critters ye be.
[152:28.29]I can't stop me tears.
[152:33.21]Tears are tiny oceans of sorrow.
[152:36.27]Tears from a poem I penned once.
[152:39.84]I forget I said that pirates don't write poems.
[152:43.66]Just another part of the pirate's code.
[152:47.34]I'm shoveling off for now, Jimmy.
[152:51.45]I'm okay.
[152:56.91]We leave.

[154:05.32]It's that simple.
[154:06.52]It's so- it's a very easy simple equation.
[154:13.00]Go gamble for 4k.

[155:46.50]Thanks to you, my men are ready for the worst.
[155:48.54]They're prepared to face the great furry evil.
[155:53.20]I think I've upgraded.
[156:01.81]Time for training is over.
[156:03.79]We gotta come up with a plan to save Memphis.
[156:06.35]Once we've drawn up our battle plan, we'll be ready to take on the Great Hairy Threat.
[156:10.21]We'll need you when the time comes.
[156:14.19]It's time we take the fight to the enemy.
[156:18.60]It's time we... Romnimus Romnimus, whatever that means.
[156:21.08]Help us take down the tyrannical Tau.
[156:23.04]Okay.
[156:28.72]Let's talk to the dog.
[156:35.06]I think we need the dog side of the story.
[156:36.56]Do I have enough time to do anything else?
[156:59.38]Centrist.
[157:04.35]What a centrist.
[157:12.56]Uh, you.
[157:13.14]I remember you.
[157:13.92]Go join the pirates.
[157:15.84]They're looking for people.
[157:16.56]Hey, yeah.
[157:18.80]Word is you got a hot rod.
[157:20.98]How about a little game of chicken?
[157:23.98]Game of chicken?
[157:24.58]Wait, you want me to drive in?
[157:28.35]You want to drive into each other?
[157:30.69]Why would we do this?
[157:32.99]Whoever stops closest to the edge wins.
[157:34.89]Press B to slam on the brakes.
[157:38.35]What?
[157:49.55]I'm not driving the car.
[157:57.89]Okay, the brakes... The brakes take a little while.
[158:06.22]No!
[158:06.96]GBRobo!
[158:09.94]Take this, you crazy robot!
[158:11.60]Oh, let's do it again.
[158:16.18]Yes, alright.
[158:18.96]I thought it was going to be hit and stop immediately, but you have to... Okay, I get it.
[158:40.62]This really is a great, this really is a great Wii game that came out 500 times.
[158:44.60]Oh, come on!
[159:01.08]He's giving me 50 bucks here.
[159:02.08]Can I just grind this?
[159:03.26]$50 every time?
[159:09.38]I stopped that pretty quick.
[159:11.36]I stopped that.
[159:12.02]Almonder Wi-Fi.
[159:14.65]Does this work?
[159:15.23]Almonder.
[159:15.75]Almonder.
[159:16.75]Almonder.
[159:17.19]Wi-Fi.
[159:29.69]It worked.
[159:29.95]I had to have done it.
[159:30.53]Not terrible.
[159:30.81]Pretty close.
[159:31.51]Hmm.
[159:31.69]Let's see.
[159:32.27]Oh, you did.
[159:32.71]D. How did I get a D?
[159:34.41]That was so good.
[160:02.50]Give it a rest, man.
[160:03.42]Come back later.
[160:04.58]How is that a D?
[160:05.90]That was so good.
[160:06.46]That was so... Bye-bye.
[160:35.25]That's kind of not fair.
[160:38.00]I got really close to the edge.
[160:39.24]I was almost over the edge.
[160:53.70]I'm pissed off.
[161:01.90]Well...
[161:03.27]Let's go into mom's room while I have some minutes here.
[161:07.15]I hear this game is three games and then a final grade.
[161:28.88]Oh, there's something here.
[161:34.20]Later.
[161:39.00]Later.
[161:47.45]Is this the Alminder Wi-Fi streamer?
[161:50.45]I'm not sure.
[161:50.85]Alminder, Alminder, Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi.
[161:55.27]Mom, wake up.
[161:56.23]You have something for me.

[162:31.78]No, thank you.
[162:32.24]I can't eat anymore.
[162:33.32]I just tried to bark and it didn't do anything.
[162:35.70]Bark.
[162:35.86]No.
[162:35.98]House of fun.
[162:37.18]House of fun.

[162:40.26]House of fun.
[162:40.70]Jenga.
[163:07.21]Hey you!
[163:16.09]That cow is one ornery hound dog.
[163:19.71]I saw him trying to bite off his own tail once.
[163:23.33]He was a sweet little puppy though.
[163:24.93]All he needed was his doggy bone to make him happy.
[163:48.77]It's the suit.
[163:49.91]Peter, it's the suit I don't think I can get up any higher
[164:17.60]You know, it's easy to forget that the point of this game is picking up candy wrappers.
[164:20.71]That's what I'm saying.
[164:21.47]People give me shit for cleaning.
[164:24.29]It's on the front cover of the box.
[164:28.53]With a vacuum cleaner.
[164:29.47]No, it's not.
[164:30.96]It's him carrying his plug on his head.
[164:34.82]I don't know.
[164:35.34]I thought it was him with a vacuum cleaner.
[164:40.13]I can't do anything in here.
[164:43.62]Alright.
[164:44.46]We need a game plan.
[164:46.91]Game plan.
[164:47.77]During the day, talk to the dog.
[164:49.31]Find out the dog's side of the story.
[165:00.26]Remove the suit and talk to the dino.
[165:05.76]Okay.
[165:10.10]Game plan.
[165:10.60]Wi-Fi!
[165:11.40]Wi-Fi!
[165:13.72]Why would I say that when I have it here?
[165:19.41]It's right here.
[165:20.31]I don't even need to say it anymore.
[165:28.07]Oh!
[165:29.25]PB Robo!

[165:36.83]Ma Sanderson's trapped in there and he hasn't had any food or water for three days!
[165:44.29]Boy, he's been neglected as criminal.
[165:46.55]There ain't no two ways about it.
[165:48.05]Look at how young and strong he is.
[165:54.52]He's the picture of gallantry.
[165:58.00]Oh, if only I could open them blind.
[166:01.48]That ain't nothing but wishful thinking, though.
[166:04.58]If I were prone to melodrama, I might phrase it like this.
[166:12.05]dum dum dum dum the old dino can't open the blinds will funky phil ever know freedom again yep I reckon that's what I'd say pretty sad ain't it if only somebody could open them for him
[166:48.40]How the fuck do I open it?
[166:49.24]I don't get any new items to open this.
[167:13.68]I tried doing this before.
[167:16.16]Wait, hold on.
[167:16.90]I was just up here.
[167:18.20]Come on, baby.
[167:20.20]Come on, girl.

[178:15.60]Let's see.
[178:20.91]Hmm.
[178:21.61]Interesting.
[178:22.81]Where is it?
[178:24.73]In the TV?
[178:25.09]It's the cap on the TV?
[178:42.39]Wait a minute.
[178:49.47]What?
[178:50.19]I don't get it.
[178:52.42]Is it the nozzle?
[178:55.78]I mean, I've already turned the nozzle.
[179:02.98]I've already switched the channel.
[179:06.04]Shovel, maybe?
[179:06.66]No?
[179:24.67]I don't understand.
[179:28.49]It doesn't do anything.
[179:30.25]Is it maybe underneath?
[179:53.95]No, no way, right?
[179:56.85]I can't change the channel when using the radar?
[179:58.49]Huh.
[180:01.24]Weird.
[180:05.36]I cannot interact with the radar.
[180:06.84]It doesn't do anything.
[180:08.54]It makes the radar do the radar again.
[180:10.02]What about underneath?
[180:20.10]That'd be something weird, right?
[180:27.69]Alright, let me try First of all plug in before I die, I don't think you can plug it in.

[181:26.23]Doesn't look like there's anything behind the TV.
[181:32.19]There is nothing behind the TV.
[181:40.24]Huh.
[181:43.92]Well, I have no idea.

[182:59.39]Alright, uh, we need to go to the kitchen.
[183:04.51]Kitchen, kitchen, this way.
[183:24.91]I did find Mr. Prongs.
[183:26.05]I did.
[183:26.35]It was very strange.
[183:27.75]Very strange man.
[183:41.76]Revive Gigachad?
[183:44.30]I will only do 4,000 more to do that.
[183:47.32]I'll have enough soon.
[183:48.00]I just want to complete a couple more of these things.
[183:55.85]Dog's not in the kitchen.
[183:56.71]Hey you!
[184:01.09]Oh, alright, there's a new crew member, hold on.
[184:04.18]Where's the dog?
[184:09.70]Where's the dog?
[184:22.84]Outside?
[184:23.66]Maybe.
[184:23.96]Let me go tell this guy to go join the pirates, though.
[184:32.51]That was a gold.
[184:34.43]It was worth it.
[184:45.03]Alright.
[184:45.68]I want to fly... I'm going to probably just use the bridge, huh?
[185:00.64]Can I get to the table from here?
[185:03.00]Uh, I didn't get to get to the table.
[185:09.23]Okay, let me try.
[185:11.67]I'll go for it.
[185:12.29]Perfect.
[185:12.77]Hey, go join the pirate crew.
[185:14.03]Goodbye.
[185:32.05]I'm Cincy!
[185:32.73]I want to be a pirate!
[185:34.63]Captain Plankbert is recruiting pirates.
[185:37.86]Go!
[185:39.00]Go!
[185:39.42]Get out of here!
[185:40.06]Go!
[185:49.46]Five.
[185:52.14]Bad.
[185:53.90]Okay.
[186:04.30]Seven out of nine.
[186:04.86]Did I miss any, uh, radars in here?
[186:12.98]Yep.
[186:21.17]I'm gonna go, yeah, I'm gonna, mom is probably awake now.
[186:23.31]I'm gonna go to mom.
[186:24.57]Get the sweater.
[186:25.13]Feed the bird?
[186:28.41]I don't have the food for the bird.
[186:31.75]Bird wants something super nutritious.
[186:33.39]I don't have anything.
[186:34.63]I'm gonna have to go... Maybe the funky seed will do it?
[186:37.77]Once the seed grows into a plant?
[186:53.35]Oh, let's go upstairs.
[186:54.67]Let's go get the costume.
[186:57.23]Still don't know.
[186:57.67]I gotta find the dog, too.
[186:59.26]Uh, no, no, no.
[187:01.38]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[187:02.74]Boyer.
[187:25.85]Okay.
[187:26.59]Are there any more of those pirates?
[187:28.51]I think I saw a pirate person in here, right?
[187:30.81]What is red block?
[187:38.62]There's two up there.
[187:52.41]Oh, those are not pirates.
[187:53.43]They're... They're spacemen.
[187:55.37]Oh.
[187:55.81]Oh, well.
[187:58.79]Go talk to Mom. ...
[188:23.62]out of here.
[188:25.43]I can just turn this into money now, right?
[188:26.85]There's really no reason for me to be collecting this anymore.
[188:29.51]Alright, give me my new costume. ...
[188:57.15]Okay, Mom.
[189:01.33]Do I have to meet the aliens?
[189:04.74]Oh, I have to bring the Giga Robo back to life.
[189:08.30]Hi, Mom.
[189:11.38]I just need to plant this seed somewhere.
[189:24.75]I need $4,000 to bring Giga Robo back to life.
[189:27.85]How much do I have right now?
[189:30.61]1,200? 1,200.
[189:52.92]I have a theory that that's if the game needs to load.
[189:55.72]That's to load extra assets.
[190:00.61]Alright, Mom, give me my costume.
[190:14.31]Oh, you're dressing up like Tao?
[190:15.49]Can you talk like him too?
[190:17.68]I just remembered a dream I had.
[190:19.58]You were picking up garbage around the house.
[190:24.19]Whenever I have that dream, the house seems to sparkle in the morning.
[190:27.71]Thank you.
[190:45.56]Costume.
[190:47.58]I wanted to make you something, but there aren't any old clothes.
[190:49.74]Really?
[190:49.98]I can't make anything without any material.
[190:52.68]What should I do?
[190:54.44]I'll hunt around a bit for something, so just wait a little longer.
[190:56.68]Make sure you tell me if you find anything we can use.
[190:59.70]Why?
[191:03.60]This is underwear?
[191:14.58]Um, can you use old boxers?
[191:29.27]Did you find any old fabric?
[191:31.16]I did.
[191:31.52]A dirty pair of underwear.
[191:41.46]That'll work nicely.
[191:42.28]You know, I'm pretty sure there are three pieces of old clothing.
[191:45.07]This material is fine.
[191:48.39]Let's get you measurements.
[191:55.51]You know, Chibo, for a little fellow, you sure are a hard worker.
[192:01.64]If only my lazy husband had some of your go, your get up and go.
[192:06.60]I wonder how long this will drag on.
[192:08.02]Oh, let's forget about that for now.
[192:11.53]Why don't we get you all measured up?
[192:13.67]Turn around and raise your arm.
[192:21.63]Don't move.
[192:26.09]That's right, stay still.
[192:26.95]You're almost as tall as one pack of cigarettes.
[192:31.15]Your height and shoulder width are... You're a small one, aren't you?
[192:34.65]I bet it's hard to find your size at the store.
[192:39.17]I can't imagine trying to shop for chibi pants.
[192:42.68]Alright, the rest is a surprise.
[192:44.54]Just you wait and see.
[192:46.41]I think it'll be done by tomorrow, so go play with Papa for the time being.
[192:53.71]Okay.
[192:59.87]Thanks, Mom.
[193:03.80]Briefcase code... Mom?
[193:07.28]Briefcase code...
[193:12.49]And by the way, Mom, help me get up here.
[193:19.13]Look at how much I'm struggling.

[194:57.68]You got anything new for me to say or do or anything?
[195:03.54]Who's been bringing me flowers?
[195:05.67]It must be a secret admirer.
[195:07.71]I'm sure he's just a wonderful person.

[201:12.03]Maybe at night?
[201:12.75]Yeah.
[201:15.68]You almost killed her.
[201:16.66]It's alright.
[201:18.78]Let's come back at night.
[201:20.74]I got a lot of shit to do.
[201:22.54]What money do I have?
[201:26.88]Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[201:29.28]Ahaha, I got it off.
[201:43.26]Alright, I can do another, uh... I can do 1,000 kilowatts to Giga Robo.
[201:50.38]And I need 3,000 more to activate Giga Robo.
[201:54.76]Giga Robo.
[202:06.83]I think a battery has 6,000 kilowatts.
[202:07.85]I do.
[202:08.09]Let's put it on 1,000.
[202:36.68]Mega Giga Ultra Chat.
[202:37.92]We're almost there.
[202:43.50]3,000 more.
[202:58.98]Does it pop for anybody else?
[203:00.18]Yeah, his voice in here, only in here really, is popped, and some music does.
[203:03.96]I'm not exactly sure why.
[203:05.96]Uh, I'm gonna convert these.
[203:08.36]Ah, actually I have almost a thousand.
[203:31.49]Emulator issues?
[203:32.53]Well, however the Wii is emulating the GameCube's audio.
[203:36.24]That is a problem there.
[203:40.54]Stop reading what I say.
[203:41.50]Alright, let's go back up to the foyer.
[203:46.74]And scare her at night.
[204:02.09]Is this the kitchen?
[204:03.19]No.
[204:06.76]Oh, this is original hardware.
[204:08.04]Well, it's on a Wii.
[204:10.28]Wii is an original.
[204:12.92]We've already... How many times do we have to have this conversation?
[204:14.78]The Wii is the GameCube.
[204:18.10]With a couple bells and whistles.
[204:38.11]Uh, this way.
[204:41.64]It's mostly the same hardware with the CPU running at a higher speed.
[204:59.29]That's correct.
[205:13.61]Alright, time to scare you.
[205:14.89]Come here.
[205:19.81]Look at this.
[205:26.25]Help!
[205:30.48]Shit.
[205:32.32]Stop it.
[205:32.86]Please, stop it.
[205:33.84]Wait, so what's going on?
[205:35.18]Mort!
[205:42.06]Mort, the plan didn't work!
[205:49.72]Mort?
[206:00.45]Where is Mort?
[206:18.03]where is he not over here uh there he is
[206:45.22]Okay, well, Mort, I need to go up there.
[206:49.60]Mort?
[206:51.22]Wait, this is a D battery.
[206:52.08]No, I don't care about... Who cares about batteries?
[206:54.99]We're gonna go talk to Mort.
[207:03.29]Mort, I got a great plan.
[207:09.08]It's gonna work, trust me.
[207:11.30]Mort, trust me.
[207:15.37]First, let me get these snacks out of the way.
[207:24.40]Oh, the French Champagne.
[207:25.56]That was pretty close, yeah.
[207:38.49]Okay, Mort.
[207:39.37]I'm ready for the plan.
[207:46.64]You rattled the very depths of my soul!
[207:48.70]A hero and a princess, a time-worn cliche, isn't it?
[208:03.59]Yes, we all know that story, don't we?
[208:06.43]But I'm sure Princess Pits would rather have lovely fresh flowers instead of my withered stems.
[208:12.45]Whenever I touch a flower, it dies.
[208:16.13]if a lovely nectar flower were to bloom here I'm sure Princess Kiss would be very happy hey excuse me Chibi-Robo is always prepared
[208:51.11]What do you think about that?
[208:57.19]Well, see you in a couple days while you stare at a plant growing.
[209:07.90]Oh, don't mind me.
[209:08.64]I'm just going to pick up this trash.
[209:16.37]Water it?
[209:17.33]You can't water anything in the game.
[209:21.10]There's no water.
[209:21.80]There's no watering.
[209:23.72]Have you guys been paying attention to anything going on in this video game?
[209:26.62]There's no watering this plant.
[209:36.04]Has anybody even been paying attention?
[209:37.52]What, have you guys been playing Scrabble together?
[209:38.96]Use a plunger?
[209:40.10]Okay.
[209:40.30]Okay.
[209:51.67]I gotta get up to the pirate.
[209:53.95]How do I do that?
[210:18.14]Yay, I'm covered in nectar!
[210:24.03]Okay, good.
[210:33.18]I can go up there.
[210:37.64]Can I not get any higher than this, up on the bed?
[210:39.80]I don't think I have the capabilities to do this yet.
[210:45.38]I have to though, right?
[210:50.90]If I get up there, can I go from here to this painting over here?
[210:56.83]Maybe the other side of the bed.
[210:57.87]Oh, fuck.
[210:59.13]Let me check the other side.
[211:04.46]Can I do something over here?
[211:30.89]Get up there.
[211:35.68]No, you fucking idiot.
[211:39.40]Alright, nice.
[211:55.22]Oh, there's a door up here.
[211:56.80]Oh, fuck, I'm all the way up.
[211:58.34]Hold on, hold on.
[211:58.92]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[212:01.08]Get this first.
[212:05.81]Apologize for being mean to Chibi.
[212:07.05]I'm talking about me.
[212:08.55]I'm the one in control of Chibi-Robo.
[212:10.33]I'm talking about me.
[212:11.57]Alright, there's still a lot more doors up here.
[212:21.29]Oh wait, she's sleeping.
[212:23.17]Um, okay.
[212:23.95]I can climb that.
[212:38.37]Go all the way up.
[212:41.90]Shit.
[212:42.66]I think I need to get a snack.
[212:47.22]I think I need a snack.
[212:56.36]Anybody else need a snack?
[212:57.84]I could use a snack right now.
[213:01.84]If I go like this... Squeeze apple thing?
[213:11.28]No, something a little more substantial.
[213:12.62]There's a train over here.
[213:28.94]Maybe like beef jerky.
[213:31.20]Yeah, I got one.
[213:36.02]How close am I to the end of the game?
[213:40.00]Am I getting close?
[213:40.68]I mean, I'm still having fun.
[213:43.46]I'm not going to stop the stream right now, but I feel like I'm getting kind of close.
[213:56.59]What's the train?
[213:57.77]Can I do something with the train?
[214:01.79]That's kind of cool.
[214:02.93]Look at this.
[214:03.41]It's so cute.
[214:03.95]I don't even need to use the box.
[214:17.04]Still fun to ride.
[214:17.76]Can I do anything with the flower?
[214:23.34]Ooh, a box.
[214:45.88]Green block.
[214:47.64]Alright, let's go up here.
[214:50.56]Oh, shit.
[214:55.10]Okay.
[214:57.38]Hold on, let me just... Something right here.
[215:10.31]That actually hurt.
[215:14.75]No, it's in the very corner of the room.
[215:16.30]Okay.
[215:17.12]Alright, I gotta get out of here.
[215:19.46]I can't fuck around.
[215:21.58]I'm gonna run out of battery.
[215:22.60]Ooh, snorkel!

[215:58.00]Oh!

[217:16.09]Okay, same deal.
[217:50.72]Does the family know that this is a sentient being?
[217:54.22]Probably not.
[217:54.86]Alright, we got two things to do here.
[217:58.84]First of all, we're gonna do pirate first.
[218:00.30]Uh, so... Fuck?

[246:17.74]Drake Redcrest has much to learn.
[246:20.60]Only then can justice truly prevail.
[246:24.54]Thusly, I will study a new technique.
[246:27.70]If I am able to master it, I'm sure the lovely princess will be impressed.
[246:32.64]But for now, I must return to my training.

[248:53.83]Where's the last crew member?
[248:56.11]Plug it in.
[248:56.53]Come on, Giga Robo.
[249:03.11]You are fully charged.
[249:04.12]You have plenty of battery.
[249:05.48]It's time to talk.
[249:16.14]Oi, there, chibi.
[249:17.12]Have you truly filled that hulkin' battery?
[249:21.30]You're an amazing pico... piece of work.
[249:24.15]But you've not yet found Giga Robo's missing leg, have you?
[249:33.59]And his leg.
[249:35.44]Out with it, Giga Robo!
[249:36.76]What have you done with your leg, matey?
[249:38.92]Ah, what am I saying?
[249:42.22]You have no tongue, I... to speak with.
[249:49.68]Why won't he turn on?
[249:50.54]Turn on!
[249:52.08]I can't turn him on?
[249:52.70]Oh, he needs the leg to turn on.
[250:04.70]What?
[250:06.17]Alright, well let's go get the fucking leg.
[250:07.59]Where's the other pirate?
[250:24.99]Get off me!
[250:26.11]I just wanna- But if you woke up without a leg... I mean, it'd be like, where's my leg?
[250:39.32]Exactly.
[250:54.47]Yeah, but I could still talk.
[250:55.73]I could be like, oh, hey, I've been asleep for like 10 years.
[250:59.38]Oh, yeah, you can get my leg, but let me tell you something.
[251:01.28]Let's talk.
[251:03.64]I'll be like, I'll go get your leg, but give me some data.
[251:08.70]You wouldn't be that calm?
[251:10.84]I probably would be.
[251:16.97]No, you would just wake up in whatever state that you were turned off in.
[251:21.61]So if you were, let's say you were asleep, right?
[251:24.61]If you got turned back on, you'd be open your eyes.
[251:27.61]Oh, wait, what the fuck is going on?
[251:29.21]I mean, if somebody was chasing you around with like a frying pan and you got turned off, that's the last thing that happened in your brain.
[251:36.80]So you're going to turn on and think someone's still behind you with a frying pan.
[251:42.79]But if you were watching TV, if you were in the middle of Adam Sandler presents Happy Gilmore, and right when Bob Barker says, the price is wrong, right?
[251:52.13]And then you get turned off, you're like, huh?
[251:55.19]When you get turned back on, you're going to be like, where am I?
[252:12.69]Can we turn you off?
[252:14.15]Don't you wish.
[252:14.81]Alright, should I go commune with the- communicate with the aliens?
[252:23.58]I need to get the- How do I get anything else?
[252:35.14]What about these guys?
[252:35.70]Are these guys still going?
[252:36.42]They're like planning to fight the dog, right?
[252:42.02]How you guys doing?
[252:57.54]I'm so sleepy.
[253:01.59]Tenhunt, wake up, soldier.
[253:03.55]I've gotta stand up.
[253:04.33]Oh, I'm making him sleepy.
[253:13.69]We gotta come up with a plan to save Memphis.
[253:16.27]Once we've drawn up our battle plan, we'll be ready to take on the Great Hairy Threat.
[253:18.99]Alright, well, do it!
[253:44.88]Alright, he's done.
[253:45.52]The dog is right here, but I... He's asleep.
[253:54.73]Hey, Hunter TV Robo, may I have a word?
[253:56.57]Sure.
[254:00.69]I'm having trouble mastering my new move.
[254:03.63]Am I raising my foot wrong?
[254:04.84]Perhaps I need to shake my hip more.
[254:09.24]What is that?
[254:09.80]What are they doing here?
[254:13.63]Cold.
[254:14.17]Cold.
[254:14.73]Ice.
[254:16.42]Cold.
[254:18.24]Ice.
[254:18.48]Cold.
[254:18.96]Freezing.
[254:19.64]Must remember.
[254:21.70]Remember!
[254:22.14]That is how it should look.
[254:24.76]More or less.
[254:25.32]What do you think, Space Hunter Chibi-Robo?
[254:28.65]Yeah, sure.
[254:32.27]It is just as I thought.
[254:33.11]I shall stay the course no matter the cost.
[254:35.85]A thousand thanks to you.
[254:40.06]Okay.
[254:40.64]I get it.
[254:45.56]Why are the aliens watching?
[254:51.87]Dog's asleep.
[254:52.71]I can't talk to the dog.
[254:55.35]Um... Kitchen.
[255:10.05]So much trash!
[255:11.29]He's not doing his job!
[255:26.90]Somebody said, try the drain again.
[255:28.20]Somebody said, go back in the drain.
[255:30.68]Go in the drain.
[255:32.35]Okay.
[255:34.07]I did say I wanted to go in the drain.
[255:35.87]That was a long time ago.
[255:42.79]Clean the drain.
[255:48.68]Drain gang.
[255:49.46]Is that why everyone's been saying drain gang?
[255:58.23]There are rats down here though.
[255:59.73]You guys are fucking funny.
[256:02.09]What's my bonus? 52.
[256:30.09]Alright, give me the gun because the rats are down here.
[256:35.01]Hard shot.
[256:35.71]Hard shot in the head.
[256:56.78]I missed.
[256:57.38]As if this is missing.
[256:59.36]What the hell?
[257:01.38]Huh?
[257:04.62]What?
[257:13.60]No, I gotta go up there.
[257:22.69]Fucking emulator audio.
[257:31.20]Ah, what's the shitty emulator he's using?
[257:43.57]It's alright, I'm made out of metal.
[257:49.25]Why can't I shoot these guys?
[257:50.59]Alright, dude!
[257:53.32]Really?
[257:55.36]Ahhh!
[258:01.75]That's horse shit!
[258:04.05]Oh fuck!
[258:04.83]Okay.
[258:05.19]Is there anything else down here?
[258:30.47]What else is down here?
[258:41.26]Talk to the rats.
[258:44.28]You can't talk to the rats.
[258:48.18]Wait, did I miss something?
[258:57.32]I'm trying to float across.
[259:00.96]Come on.
[259:01.40]Can I shoot this?
[259:02.62]With a charge?
[259:04.24]Oh, fuck.
[259:05.06]Okay.
[259:30.98]So is there nothing else I can do in here?
[259:32.28]Is that it?
[259:32.88]Did I complete it?
[259:34.10]That's nothing else I can do, alright.
[259:46.09]Quick, get out now.
[259:56.05]Alright, I gotta get that fucking code.
[259:57.37]Can you stop swearing?
[259:59.53]Yeah, I will.
[260:00.13]I need to get that code.
[260:00.99]Code for the briefcase.
[260:02.27]Who is Dad?
[260:02.67]Who is Dad?
[260:03.07]What do I do with the snorkel?
[260:29.76]I have this... Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[260:31.04]The flower's in bloom.
[260:31.76]Can I swim in the fish tank?
[260:41.40]Look.
[260:44.73]You want to give this flower to Mrs. Sanderson as a gift?
[260:47.55]Yes.
[260:47.87]Okay.
[261:00.55]You want to give this flower to Mrs. Sanderson as a gift?
[261:03.45]Yes.
[261:15.63]You want to give this flower to Mrs. Sanderson as a gift?
[261:17.63]Yes.
[261:35.41]Wake me up.
[262:02.92]Good.
[262:03.08]Crackling.
[262:03.42]Alright.
[262:03.72]So, we're in the daytime.
[262:04.44]What's the plan?
[262:05.36]I have a frog ring for you.
[262:38.99]I actually have two.
[262:46.19]I think there's only one more or two more, right?
[262:50.00]Two more.
[262:51.44]Behind the waterfall.
[262:56.00]Yup.
[263:10.77]Find the waterfall in the foyer.
[263:12.25]Where's the other one?
[263:13.05]Where have I seen one more?
[263:14.13]In the kitchen?
[263:18.25]Can I get up the waterfall from here?
[263:34.30]Where's that waterfall?
[263:45.94]Um, can I get up there?
[263:53.23]Go upstairs and then... I'm going to go upstairs and then fall?
[263:58.51]Everyone pulls his pants down for the urinal.
[264:02.63]Yes, I do.
[264:03.07]I've given my reasons for why I do that.
[264:17.98]Can these things all be dead?
[264:32.48]Yes, I go over the pants.
[264:34.82]I go over the pants over the underwear.
[264:36.15]I don't go through the underwear.
[264:38.81]What a dumb fucking invention.
[264:40.77]Through the... What is that?
[264:43.63]Nonsense.
[264:51.43]What a joke of a design.
[264:53.09]Alright, where... Oh, the waterfall's up here, isn't it?
[265:13.31]It's up there, okay.
[265:15.70]How can I reliably get up there?
[265:18.16]Same way I did before.
[265:46.47]I'm gonna go piss on the golden toilet seat.
[265:49.95]Why are you pissing on the toilet seat?
[266:15.60]That's so good.
[266:16.52]I guess you can hang.
[266:21.80]But you're nothing special.
[266:24.19]There it is.
[266:24.69]It's Vegas!
[266:25.69]Hmm.
[266:25.85]Let's see.
[266:26.35]Oh, you did.
[266:27.59]Let's see.
[266:40.38]Almond or Wi-Fi?
[266:41.10]Would you like almonds or Wi-Fi?
[266:45.48]I love that
[267:13.70]I held it for too long!
[267:18.75]Ah!
[267:19.87]Again.
[267:20.11]Again.
[267:47.59]Why can't that be my car?
[268:03.55]Alright.
[268:04.25]Again.
[268:05.19]Good.
[268:07.79]You're almost as good as I am.
[268:08.87]Wanna be my sidekick?
[268:11.23]A V!
[268:28.66]I want an A. Give it a rest, man.
[268:31.86]Come back later.
[268:32.54]Fine.
[268:33.42]Fuck you.
[268:33.78]Don't be toxic.
[268:42.46]He was toxic.
[268:58.69]it hasn't pooped in four days thankfully he's hooked up to a machine that'll make chat unreadable for 20 to 30 seconds
[269:27.66]And so from here, we gotta go to the... this side.
[269:30.78]Let's go get... Oh my god!
[269:38.94]No?
[269:40.44]That's not how you do this?
[269:43.28]Really?
[269:53.31]Did I just not do it good enough?
[270:06.43]Can I jump on top of the lip?
[270:10.73]No, I should be able to get that.
[270:12.61]Holy shit, I don't think I can do this.
[270:36.29]this this is not the correct way to get up there the banister
[271:05.74]Yeah, it's definitely from here then.
[271:10.26]It's definitely like Romulus Wi-Fi, Romulus Wi-Fi.
[271:16.21]Uh, no it ain't.
[271:17.77]No it not, no it ain't.
[271:48.92]Alright, I have to move on.
[271:56.52]If I can't get this in one jump, I gotta...
[272:16.76]I gotta keep playing.
[272:17.82]I think it's stuck here for like an hour.
[272:32.47]Don't move on.
[272:33.19]Do it for Jenny.
[272:34.05]Well, I'm trying, but... I'm trying.
[272:46.32]It's got to be perfect.
[272:47.24]I can't get a little higher than this.
[272:49.89]I don't think that's how you do this.
[272:54.15]I doubt that's how I do this.
[273:16.04]Stop going so early.
[273:18.62]What are you talking about?
[273:27.71]It is though.
[273:34.13]Giga chat is more important than trying the same finicky jump a hundred times.
[273:37.97]You're right.
[273:38.83]That's what I'm going to do.
[274:09.02]Nope.
[274:09.76]No way.
[274:13.12]What the fuck, man?
[274:16.28]No, nope.
[274:19.77]I don't get a running start?
[274:24.43]Why not?
[274:40.18]Can I go over here?
[274:43.58]Nope.
[274:46.90]You'll never make it!
[274:48.10]Ha ha ha ha ha!
[274:56.16]God damn!
[274:56.84]How are you supposed to do this reliably?
[275:02.61]Uh, I can't start here because if I hit A, I'm gonna climb down.
[275:16.02]Oh my god, that's so hard.
[275:17.92]Okay.
[275:24.08]Now what?
[275:25.02]Oh.
[275:33.89]Wait.
[275:37.69]Okay, it's down.
[275:46.93]Looks like chat was right again.
[275:51.43]As always, we're never wrong.
[275:59.11]Chat was right again.
[276:02.25]It's almost like collectively 4,000 people could come up with a solution because at least one or two of you have played this game before.
[276:13.48]Chat was right every time.
[276:23.06]I'm always out of fuckin' battery.
[276:24.04]Get up there!
[276:47.88]Get in there!
[276:48.48]I can't climb in there?
[277:08.50]What in the name of fucking God?
[277:12.68]Yep.
[277:13.34]I know, I know, I know what's going on.
[277:14.83]I know what's going on.
[277:15.53]I know what's going on.
[277:16.29]I know what's going on.
[277:17.53]I looked at this.
[277:18.09]I saw this.
[277:18.43]There's a fucking... There's a thing over here.
[277:22.07]Hold on.
[277:23.19]Oh my fucking God.
[277:28.28]Why can I not get in there?
[277:30.28]Stop the water?
[277:33.19]Put the snorkel on?
[277:34.13]No, no, no, no, no.
[277:35.86]I'm almost out of battery.
[277:36.90]I don't want to do that jump again.
[277:39.74]I think I can shoot something over here.
[277:41.70]Wait.
[277:46.35]I saw it.
[277:47.03]I saw it already.
[277:48.89]There's a sticker over here.
[277:50.05]How would I know the sticker was over here?
[277:54.63]I would have been like, where is it?
[277:55.71]I don't know.
[277:56.76]Where is it?
[277:57.14]Chat, I don't see it.
[277:57.90]Blind?
[277:58.18]What are you talking about?
[278:15.33]Alright, give me that do that damn thing Only one more of these where's the final frog point?
[278:51.01]Go, man, go, go, go, man, go, man, go, man, go, man, go!
[278:54.29]Uh, where's the last one?
[279:00.89]I still have to do, uh, I still have to go to Mom's room.
[279:04.13]Give Mom the flowers.
[279:08.57]Once I give Mom the flowers, then we can go, uh, from there.
[279:12.63]so so
[279:40.16]Alright, Mom.
[279:41.16]I've got three different flowers for you.

[279:54.47]Do you like flowers?
[280:01.90]I've got three.

[281:09.94]Thank you.
[281:11.48]Don't put me back down, though, because I have... Fine, you only get the blue one.

[281:57.67]The one that was in the drain was behind that weird wall.
[282:00.68]I definitely have seen one in a room that I haven't gotten.
[282:19.31]Budget went all towards dad's toes and no one gets fingers.
[282:22.78]It's outrageous.

[285:49.91]Imagine never eating Burger King ever for 20, 30,000 years.
[285:55.63]And eating it for the first time.
[285:57.84]Imagine us not eating Burger King for like 20 years.
[286:02.95]Then you eat, like, three french fries.
[286:05.71]It'd be bad.
[286:07.73]Friend dead.
[286:10.28]Ganymede.
[286:15.54]Thank you for helping, Ganymede.

[292:21.10]No!
[292:46.63]I've never seen anything like this.
[292:50.30]Can I go with you?
[293:01.51]You know, it's taken me this long to tell you.
[293:04.21]I really don't like you around.
[293:07.31]You're kind of annoying, and I really don't want to be your friend.
[293:11.23]Now, I would only say this if I was going to disappear through a time paradox forever.
[293:16.52]Don't take this the wrong way.
[293:20.24]He can come.
[293:20.68]Yeah, he can come in.
[293:27.83]I mean, I would have told you, but we're gonna see each other at the Starbucks down the street every day.
[293:31.44]It'd be weird.
[293:32.34]I would have told you.
[293:46.07]We're back in time.
[293:56.07]It looks like we've stopped.
[293:57.47]Let's get out, Chibi-Robo.

[294:26.48]Ever!
[294:28.34]You can't use Giga-Robo.
[294:29.48]That's cheating!
[294:30.08]Are we in the past?
[294:36.72]Impossible.
[294:39.64]Your name.
[294:40.80]How could this be?
[294:41.46]Everything's sepia, so we must be in the past.
[294:45.19]That's pretty good.
[294:46.81]Those aliens created something extraordinary.
[294:48.61]Impossible.
[294:50.03]Shocking.
[294:51.59]Well, since we're here, we might as well do a little exploring.
[294:58.91]How do you get power in the past?
[295:01.83]There's a briefcase.
[295:21.04]No, you fool!
[295:26.28]You didn't do that in the past, and now you have to do that in the past, and you didn't exist!
[295:39.22]You just created an earthquake.
[295:45.95]I just made a time paradox.

[299:54.95]I hope our future child is cuter.
[299:57.63]Still, everybody loves their own, right?
[299:59.65]It was nice to meet you, baby robo.
[300:02.53]I don't know what your tangled story is, or how you got here on these tiny legs, but it was nice of you to stop by.
[300:12.27]I'm sure your mother is worried, so you better go home now.
[300:16.73]Please visit again when we have our own baby.
[300:18.59]All of a sudden her head just goes... Fucking pops.
[300:24.25]Like it's just, her head explodes.
[300:26.87]It's like the time paradox.
[300:45.43]Right now, those thoughts are just implanting in her current present thoughts.
[300:50.88]I fucked up the whole thing.
[300:51.98]I'm gonna open up the door out of the spaceship and I'm gonna go into the room and it's gonna be like... Everybody, I'm gonna have to go back and fucking redo this.
[301:11.25]Get the scroll?
[301:12.07]What scroll?
[301:19.08]The scroll?
[301:24.45]Wait, wait, Traveler.
[301:25.45]You missed the scroll.
[301:29.25]Where's their scroll?
[301:44.26]Wait, I'm gonna get the... Circuit schematic!
[301:48.22]Should I take the bone back?
[301:49.32]I'm gonna take the bone back too.
[301:50.24]Okay, you could've... Why did you not call it a schematic?
[301:57.03]Why did you call it a scroll?
[302:00.99]It's not a scroll.
[302:03.22]That's like ancient fucking wizardry.
[302:08.52]Where is this?
[302:09.54]Where is it?
[302:22.27]Put me back on the table.
[302:26.19]Get the scroll.
[302:29.51]Where is it?
[302:31.67]Wait, is it in?
[302:33.24]Is it in the dinosaur?
[302:47.70]Oh my god!
[303:03.51]Give it to me!
[303:04.41]Give me the scroll!
[303:06.01]Give me the ancient texts!
[303:22.13]What?!
[303:22.43]Alright, give me the bone back too.
[303:29.76]Oh no, I can't shoot the dog in the past.
[303:42.77]Give me the bone back!
[303:49.68]Can I not get the bone?
[303:53.56]Oh, sweet bone goodness, yay.
[303:58.96]I have to go... I have to go slow or I'll lose its flavor.
[304:07.39]Let's talk to the robot.
[304:09.17]The scroll.
[304:11.87]Can I talk to the robot?
[304:12.81]Okay.
[304:18.04]Be sweet as a carrot.
[304:22.77]I can't talk to the robot.
[304:26.26]He's up on another thing.
[304:27.14]I can't get him.
[304:29.48]Yes, you can.
[304:30.74]I... I can't.
[304:36.16]Steal his leg.
[304:42.05]Steal his leg.
[304:51.49]Take the leg in the past and bring it to the leg in the future.
[304:53.99]That's just... it's the same leg.
[305:00.18]No, I've already exploded too many heads.
[305:02.26]I have to leave.
[305:07.98]Yes, I'm going home.
[305:14.89]I'm gonna go open the briefcase.
[305:25.34]Oh my goodness.
[305:26.04]Everybody alright?
[305:26.62]You still sick?
[305:28.78]Alien tech dangerous.
[305:31.94]You not hurt?
[305:34.62]Must not use again.
[305:35.50]We traveled through time.
[305:39.30]That was amazing.
[305:41.02]Aliens can do neat stuff.
[305:46.58]Bye.
[305:46.78]2-4-5-5.
[305:54.03]Where can you get this game?
[305:57.13]Well, I have some unfortunate news for you.
[306:02.89]This is on the GameCube.
[306:04.43]Only on the GameCube.
[306:05.47]There's a couple of them on DS.
[306:08.39]I don't know if they're any good.
[306:09.53]I cannot speak to their quality.
[306:13.91]If you have access to a Wii, you can get it for a stupid amount of money.
[306:17.38]It's a rare GameCube disk.
[306:20.88]Or...
[306:28.39]Sorry.
[306:30.35]I would not condone anything.
[306:34.77]That had anything to do with that.
[306:36.71]But I sneezed, so I don't even know what I'm doing.
[306:41.66]That sneeze sounded illegal.
[306:46.42]No, no, it was merely a sneeze.
[306:50.64]Okay, let's go back to the basement.
[306:53.99]No, no, no, no.
[306:54.47]We have to go to the... Do we have time for this?
[306:56.09]Yeah, I do.
[306:56.39]I have a question.
[307:04.60]Was that an emulated sneeze?
[307:07.35]Yes, it was, actually.
[307:09.01]Good.
[307:09.61]Good find.
[307:10.69]That was an emulated sneeze.
[307:29.06]Get down to the basement.
[307:30.22]No!
[307:30.70]Upstairs.
[307:32.38]I know the briefcase code.
[307:33.26]We're going to the briefcase.
[307:35.20]Briefcase, briefcase, briefcase, briefcase, briefcase, briefcase.
[307:40.22]Put a sneeze on your soundboard?
[308:14.73]Wicked dusty room I'm sorry guys.
[308:30.24]And here is the ancient scrolls.
[308:34.41]Never been opened before, but please, the crowd of you, all 45 of you, thanks for coming.
[308:40.59]I just want to unveil it.
[308:42.51]I can't really read the text.
[308:43.73]If we could all lean in, maybe some of us could read it.
[308:45.69]Oh, this is a little dusty.
[308:49.23]Oof.
[308:57.40]Alright.
[309:05.21]I just said I'm leaving.
[309:06.27]I'm sorry.
[309:07.69]I'm sorry.
[309:08.53]Stay.
[309:09.21]I won't do it again.
[309:09.87]I promise.
[309:36.82]My roommate just said, what's that noise?
[309:56.49]What do you say to that?
[309:58.42]Nothing!
[310:07.25]Get this shit open.
[310:08.47]There's a leg in there.
[310:09.61]Yep.
[310:09.99]There's a Metal Gear guard?
[310:18.74]Whoa, I just released a lot of spiders.
[310:25.14]Oh.
[310:26.64]Oh my god, they're like killing mom!
[310:37.78]Honey!
[310:41.06]Oh, you locked the door!
[310:42.14]What's wrong?
[310:46.66]What the fuck?
[310:53.07]Sweet space justice!
[310:54.67]Is he gonna put on a... He's gonna put on a costume.
[310:59.61]How dare you come barging in!
[311:02.57]This isn't time for that.
[311:05.55]Head to the living room, little buddy!
[311:09.91]Genito!
[311:20.96]Seal the door!
[311:36.98]Phew, we stopped them.
[311:39.72]Why do you have all those in there?
[311:45.40]Um, honest to God, what... Why do you have all that stuff?
[311:50.84]You want to read the manual?
[311:52.24]I don't want to read the fucking manual.
[311:55.22]Why would I want to read the manual right now?
[312:16.31]How do I get into the basement?
[312:22.93]The basement's key.
[312:24.95]Oh, I just had the meme number.
[312:27.08]It was there for a second, you saw it.
[312:35.59]Alright, dog, what do you got?
[312:45.84]Hey, you want to take care of this little problem we're having here, or what?
[312:52.07]Okay.
[312:55.13]Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit.
[312:57.17]Sorry, Jenny, we're gonna be stuck in here for a while.
[312:59.11]Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit.
[313:01.85]Oh no, we're in such a hurry, we forgot your drawing set.
[313:05.29]Ribbit.
[313:06.98]Is there anything that you could do?
[313:10.34]Oh, how about looking at the photo album?
[313:13.28]Ribbit.
[313:17.10]You used to hate looking at this because it had pictures from before you were born.
[313:23.36]Ribbit, ribbit.
[313:25.14]Alright, alright, here you go, sheesh.
[313:29.60]Ribbit, ribbit.
[313:37.60]Alright, talk to me.
[313:41.06]Shh, Mama's here, so I have to whisper.
[313:43.10]I don't have my drawing stuff, so I'm looking at pictures.
[313:49.89]Um, I don't know who he is.
[313:57.31]but he's got a calculator on the bottom of his foot.
[314:04.26]Really?
[314:08.12]Really?
[314:14.73]Alright.
[314:18.53]Alright, Dad, open the door.
[314:24.63]Oh, circuit breakers, I'm sorry, Chibi-Robo, this is all my fault.
[314:27.93]Because, because I was the one who designed those nasty spy doors.
[314:33.56]What?
[314:34.94]You never told me that.
[314:40.96]I know I should have told you, I'm sorry.
[314:43.36]But listen, you need to know something.
[314:45.85]I designed the spy doors to be your friends, Chibi-Robo.
[314:49.95]But then the company reprogrammed them to be hostile and cruel.
[314:54.19]And that's why I quit Macroware Robotics Incorporated.
[314:57.28]Hey, what?
[315:02.36]You quit?
[315:03.98]Like, Q-U-I-T quit?
[315:07.26]Oh my gosh, you never told me that.
[315:09.11]You never told me about any of that.
[315:13.33]I was ashamed.
[315:14.05]I didn't want to talk about it.
[315:16.77]That's all in the past.
[315:17.69]Right now, we have to get rid of those spy doors.
[315:20.81]I'll put the energy wave that I was researching at Macrowave Robotics Incorporated to good use.
[315:26.31]I'll use it to remodel the Chibi Blaster.
[315:29.17]The spy doors are my responsibility.
[315:30.87]It's up to me to take them out.
[315:33.48]Me and Chibi-Robo.
[315:34.92]Thanks for signing me up.
[315:36.48]Could have been you.
[315:37.24]Thanks.
[315:37.86]I'll do all the work.
[315:39.06]Now that we've got that settled, let's get that circuit schematic from upstairs.
[315:44.70]Uh-huh.
[315:45.16]Do you remember what I did with it?
[315:48.15]I haven't.
[315:49.69]I haven't seen it forever.
[315:50.35]I probably threw it away.
[315:53.89]Threw.
[315:56.21]It.
[315:57.82]Away.
[316:02.40]The circuit schematic is gone?
[316:04.02]Crud.
[316:04.26]What am I going to do now?
[316:07.60]Pick me back up.
[316:10.63]The circuit schematic is gone.
[316:11.69]What am I going to do now?
[316:12.51]Crayon.
[316:23.25]The ancient scroll.
[316:25.87]That's so funny.
[316:29.05]You got it.
[316:29.97]Now that I have this, I can build something truly amazing.
[316:33.00]But I need my tool set to do it right.
[316:34.46]Let's go upstairs and grab it.
[316:36.74]Hold on, you're going upstairs?
[316:40.48]Those crazy things are upstairs.
[316:42.88]I know, but I'm the dad of this family.
[316:44.36]If anyone has to be in danger, I want it to be me.
[316:47.28]And Chibi-Robo.
[316:50.47]In fact, Chibi-Robo's gonna go first.
[316:57.65]Be careful.
[316:58.99]I will, I promise.
[317:02.11]And when I get back?
[317:04.43]Yeah?
[317:07.58]I expect a home-cooked meal waiting for me.
[317:17.78]Yeah, keep waiting, big guy.
[317:26.31]Oh, get fucked, man.
[317:29.65]Served.
[317:32.73]Fine, fine, fine.
[317:33.55]Let's go, Chibi-Robo.
[317:36.75]Fucking served.
[317:38.37]That's so funny.
[317:42.47]Huh?
[317:49.83]Hey.
[317:57.42]Let's split up, Chibi-Robo.
[317:59.28]You gotta keep the spiders busy.
[318:02.06]While you're doing that, I'm gonna get my tools from upstairs.
[318:06.26]Oh no, the eggs!
[318:07.80]Your blaster won't work on those spiders.
[318:09.48]It'll be tough, but hang in there.
[318:12.12]Be careful.
[318:14.27]It's up to you and me to save this family.
[318:18.61]Let's do this.
[318:20.83]So I can't hurt them with my blaster, so I just have to survive?
[318:24.61]What about the egg friends?
[318:27.87]Holy shit, that hurt.
[318:29.35]I'm going too slow!
[318:33.10]Ow!
[318:34.84]Ow!
[318:39.16]Help!

[319:37.86]There they are.
[319:41.63]Got it.
[319:42.83]Holy shit.
[319:46.29]Now we can give those spiders what's for.
[319:49.13]Hooray, hooray, convert it!
[319:52.57]Okay, Chibi-Robo.
[320:01.66]Get out your chibi blaster.

[321:17.58]I love how the dog has eye protection, too.
[321:31.61]Oh, that feeling.
[321:32.69]That feeling when you go get blood work done and the nurse misses the vein.
[321:38.13]Twice.
[321:39.43]You're like, oh, look.

[322:26.48]Tao.
[322:29.52]What?
[322:30.00]That wasn't a dog.
[322:31.32]That was a dog wolf?
[322:39.17]Say that again.
[322:42.37]Run that by me again.
[322:45.99]I'm getting tired.
[322:49.03]TV Robot and I are going to turn those spiders into spy chumps.
[322:51.99]Yeah, that's it.
[322:54.84]Let's go Chibi-Robo That's not a wolf That's an earthworm gym sound That like Okay, I can fight Oh shit it works
[323:24.09]Do I have charge?
[323:25.13]You bet your ass I do.
[323:35.58]One charge shot does it.
[323:36.56]Can I release the, uh... ...the little guys?
[323:44.94]Let me try.
[323:51.19]Will they help me fight?
[323:52.87]Oh, too bad.
[323:56.51]But can he suck?
[323:58.85]Probably.
[324:00.17]I'm using up charge here.
[324:01.99]Oh, that's it.
[324:03.98]Alright, we keep going?
[324:04.74]Over here.
[324:05.08]I need to plug in.

[325:03.39]Everybody alright?
[325:03.95]Uh, the family's in trouble.
[325:15.17]I have a bad feeling about this.
[325:17.23]We better recharge and hurry to the living room.
[325:26.36]Where's our plug?
[325:28.92]What about the... Can I... I want to free these guys.
[325:30.78]They can help me.
[325:36.10]They can help me, I promise.
[325:37.32]I want them as friends.
[325:39.60]I just got wink-scammed. ...
[325:59.33]Save it.
[326:12.08]Link again.
[326:12.76]E-clown.
[326:16.88]Back to the living room.
[326:27.58]I'm sorry.
[326:28.16]I'm sorry.
[326:28.92]I'm sorry.
[326:29.80]I'm sorry.
[326:30.87]I'm sorry Oh typical ribbit ribbit ribbit
[327:02.10]Um... How do I get you down?
[327:12.76]I have to go get Giga Robo.
[327:14.39]Save me, Chibi-Robo.
[327:15.45]I gotta get Giga Robo.
[327:21.83]Giga Robo is the only way.
[327:26.30]What was that?
[327:30.62]It might be a giant enemy spider.
[327:56.19]Oh, he's sucking up everything.
[327:57.53]He's magnetic.
[328:00.53]Chibi, it's the mother of all spiders!
[328:03.32]Run, Chibi, run for your life!
[328:06.18]Uh... Okay, he's... ...sucked up everything and... The living room is upside down.
[328:30.83]Wait, there's the leg.
[328:31.53]Does he have the fridge on his head?
[328:33.47]He has the fridge on his head.
[328:37.59]That looks really stupid.
[328:41.87]I think we need to fight in order to make things go back to normal.
[328:47.68]Let's go!
[328:59.72]Watch out!
[329:00.44]How do I dodge?
[329:01.54]Dodge!
[329:08.86]Shoot the armor off its body.
[329:10.16]Oh!
[329:14.36]Watch out for the bombs.
[329:17.36]What the fuck?
[329:20.67]I gotta... More distance.
[329:25.63]More distance, more distance.
[329:31.11]Didn't think I was fucking ready for this.
[329:32.27]I played like 12 hours of Mega Man Legends.
[329:35.33]The last game that I played.
[329:36.87]You don't think I'm ready?
[329:50.35]Ooh, Chibi-Rojo, watch out!
[329:51.49]Did I say Chibi-Rojo?
[329:57.08]Watch out, Chibi-Joe Rogan!
[329:59.82]Watch out for his web attack!
[330:16.20]Ooh!
[330:22.46]Jamie, pull that shit up.
[330:30.46]Ooh, chase it when it runs away.
[330:32.76]That's what I'm gonna do.
[330:45.89]Hype boobs into the foot calculator.
[330:47.89]Maybe that'll work.
[330:53.42]That's the, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[330:57.35]Here's the, the last one.
[331:12.42]Jacob Robo's leg.
[331:28.08]Oh, great.
[331:31.76]Things are going back to normal.
[331:34.39]I told you I shouldn't have fucking done anything in the past.
[331:39.67]That was crazy, Chibi-Robo.
[331:41.21]You beat that humongous spider.
[331:43.85]But now, I'm wondering...
[331:50.61]Was that spider really evil, or just programmed to act that way?
[331:55.25]What is evil?
[331:56.44]What is justice?
[331:58.50]Hmm.
[332:00.46]I think I understand how Mr. Redcrest feels.
[332:03.04]This is a Joe Rogan podcast.
[332:06.26]This is Chibi Rogan.
[332:12.51]I think I understand how Mr. Redcrest feels.

[333:45.12]Yay.
[333:48.04]It's party time.
[333:49.60]It's not party time until we turn on the other robot.
[333:54.75]And so the party continued late into the night.
[334:02.13]And family harmony was restored.
[334:09.48]Into the chibi house.
[334:12.84]Well, didn't say it was gonna be easy.
[334:17.65]And the happy point total.
[334:18.91]My new chibi ranking.
[334:20.53]I'm now in top five chibi robots ever made.
[334:48.73]I wonder what it takes to be ChibiRobo4, considering I saved a marriage, fended off dozens and dozens of murderous, killing, evil program spiders, cleaned every goddamn room a hundred fucking times, went through time without fucking it all up,
[335:12.47]What did 4 do?
[335:13.99]I'd like to see.
[335:15.55]I'd like to know.
[335:16.09]Stopped World War 3.
[335:25.24]4 saved the world.
[335:25.62]4 played Ace Attorney on stream.
[335:26.36]Ah, damn it.
[335:26.94]That's right.
[335:53.46]Let's go put Giga Robo back together again.
[335:55.64]Here we go.
[336:08.68]Oh, and give Jenny the ring, too.
[336:10.16]Wait.
[336:11.61]Space Hunter Robo!
[336:15.95]Brilliant work, and I was a witness to it all.
[336:17.85]How do you help?
[336:23.01]Enough.
[336:23.35]Leave such things aside for now.
[336:24.87]Let us relax with the watching of the television.
[336:30.16]Hurry, or we'll miss the special technique, the Great Twin Blizzard!
[336:37.14]Oh, this guy.
[336:37.64]Oh no, it begins!
[337:00.57]Good evening, I'm Ron Brokjaw for Fox News.
[337:03.71]Our country has recently been consumed by the white-hot fires of Chibi-Robo mania.
[337:08.53]And whether you know it or not, this passion casts a dark shadow on our everyday life.
[337:14.32]We now go live to Sunny Merriweather.
[337:16.46]Sunny?
[337:18.02]Ron, I'm coming to you live from in front of the nuclear power.
[337:21.88]This new Chibi-Robo mania brings with it more than clean floors and clutter-free lives.
[337:27.42]It is placing a severe demand on the local power supply.
[337:30.66]Sources tell Fogged News that if Chibi-Robos continue to fly off the shelf, power demand will outstrip supply and send the region into a panic of unfathomable proportions.
[337:42.59]Yes, we prepare for the end of the civilization as we know it, Ron.
[337:48.25]Dire prediction indeed.
[337:49.21]Thank you, Sonny.
[337:51.07]Chibi-Robos appear both dangerous and foolhardy.
[337:56.71]What will you do?
[337:59.77]It's kind of hard to... No, that's not true!
[338:03.18]That's impossible!
[338:03.90]Space Hunter Chibi-Robo, a threat?
[338:07.30]No, it's because I'm trying to do the voice.
[338:09.76]I'm trying to match the guy's voice.
[338:11.72]And this is all I hear.
[338:12.62]In my ears.
[338:13.56]While I'm trying to do the guy's voice.
[338:14.76]No, that's not true.
[338:15.26]It's a threat.
[338:15.62]It just can't be.
[338:16.16]No!
[338:26.71]space hunter Chibi-Robo we've overcome numerous trials and adversities but if this is true have I no choice must I actually defeat space hunter Chibi-Robo in Mortal Kombat if justice defeats justice is it justice oh the humanity
[338:52.87]A mind-bending conundrum.
[338:54.83]The very pain of life itself.
[338:57.97]Space Hunter Drake Redcrest!
[339:03.51]Space Hunter Robo, Drake Redcrest needs to be alone for a while.
[339:06.17]I'm sorry.
[339:19.84]I am.
[339:21.25]Uh, I want to give, uh, I want to give Jenny the... I want to give Jenny the last frog, uh, thing.
[339:26.29]I'm going to bed.
[339:27.39]I mean, if you get some news like that, like, I'm just going to bed.
[339:32.66]I'll deal with it tomorrow morning.
[339:43.27]good morning we have a final ring to give jenny
[340:12.67]I want to see what it does.
[340:16.95]Where's Jenny?
[340:20.95]Jenny?
[340:21.89]In her room?
[340:23.88]Usually she's out here.
[340:24.60]In the kitchen?
[340:38.44]No, probably in her room.
[340:46.38]Everyone's hungover.
[341:01.11]Well, Jenny's eight.
[341:03.53]So I don't think that's the case.
[341:07.12]Wait, we gotta beat, like, Vegas Rick, whatever.
[341:09.40]Vegas Dick, whatever his name is.
[341:11.06]Vegas Joe.
[341:12.22]I don't even know what his name is.
[341:13.48]I gotta get an A. Let's go.
[341:14.64]Sorry, his name is AlmonderWiFi.
[341:19.48]Alright.
[341:46.45]Pretty good.
[341:47.59]Really good.
[341:48.33]That's the best one yet.
[341:51.26]Almost as good as I am.
[341:53.72]Want to be my sidekick?
[341:55.16]Hmm.
[341:55.44]Bee?
[341:55.66]Fuck.
[342:15.32]How am I going to do this?
[342:16.56]This seems really hard.
[342:45.64]That was bad.
[342:46.82]I don't care.
[342:48.27]I don't care.
[342:49.43]It was really early.
[342:51.55]Alright.
[342:51.89]I got one more try.
[342:53.51]You can do it three times a day.
[342:55.55]One more try.
[342:56.13]That's it.
[342:56.57]Alright.
[343:15.59]No, it can't be the rest of the stream because I can only do it one more time.
[343:37.52]Oh!
[343:39.22]Oh!
[343:39.52]That's got to be it.
[343:40.70]That was damn good.
[343:42.40]You're insane.
[343:43.16]I did it!
[343:47.09]That's gotta be an A. If you gave me everything less than an A, I'd be mad.
[343:49.85]S. That's the best you can get.
[343:51.29]You got the chicken rice sticker?
[343:52.60]That was just too crazy.
[343:53.62]I'm done.
[344:22.44]Where is it?
[344:32.48]Where is it?
[344:32.90]Didn't I already have that?
[344:37.29]I thought it was the chicken.
[344:40.87]I thought I already had the car.
[344:51.95]Alright.
[344:53.17]I gotta find Jenny, and then I can... Hold on.
[344:55.67]I gotta find Jenny.
[344:58.81]Where's Jenny?
[345:04.84]Jenny!
[345:05.64]In your room.
[345:05.96]I thought Dad fixed this.
[345:23.83]Nice.
[345:24.01]We're going, Dad.
[345:25.01]She's in the kitchen?
[345:28.72]She's in the kitchen.
[345:29.68]Is she in the kitchen?
[345:33.38]During the day, isn't she in her room?
[345:39.01]Well, I'm right here.
[345:39.79]I might as well just take a peek.
[346:07.44]To the kitchen!
[346:34.30]I need to do, I gotta get them all.
[346:36.02]I'm gonna get a sticker, and I'm gonna get probably like a thousand happy points.
[346:39.16]I collected all the stickers.
[346:41.00]The frog thing, whatever they are, rings.
[346:44.50]Alright, here we go.
[346:49.41]Clean the floors?
[346:50.07]No, I don't do that anymore.
[347:05.38]He sold out.
[347:08.02]So... What do you want?
[347:10.06]I saved this whole family from... being killed.
[347:14.53]I think I can skip the floors a couple days.
[347:19.31]Hey, you!
[347:21.69]Pick me up!
[347:23.51]Pick me up!
[347:24.20]Pick me up!

[348:03.29]What are we making?
[348:21.36]Chibi-Robo, thanks to you, that huge spider is history.
[348:23.92]Woo-hoo.
[348:25.12]My wife's finally in a good mood again.
[348:26.54]We're going to live happily ever after.
[348:27.90]But I was the one who started all this trouble in the first place.
[348:33.57]I'm for a new leaf.
[348:35.55]From now on, I'm going to cook and clean and help out.
[348:39.25]It's too bad I lost my wedding ring.
[348:42.59]Oh, by the way... Aren't you an industrious bot, Chibi-Robo?
[348:46.99]I wake up and the place is spotless.
[348:50.94]I won't be using that toothbrush again, but you're doing so good to do it.
[348:55.62]You lost your wedding ring.
[348:57.46]Alright, what are we cooking?
[349:03.34]Nothing.
[349:03.64]Alright, well... I'm coming over there.
[349:22.55]I'm coming over there.
[349:56.76]Into the hair!
[349:57.58]He's even making the meals now.
[350:17.99]It's been a huge help.
[350:19.91]What's that lovely scent?
[350:20.73]Do you have a flower?
[350:22.27]Yeah.
[350:25.90]Take the big one.

[351:12.92]I'm gonna use the bridge.
[351:29.13]Wrong way.
[351:29.89]What are you, fucking a dope?
[351:31.23]What are you, a dope?
[351:34.65]If you don't like it, it's got candy.
[351:42.89]Sorry, every time somebody mentions the greatest video game in the last at least six years... I have to mention it.
[351:56.70]How do I get your fucking attention?
[352:05.66]I'm coming!
[352:06.76]I'm gonna give you these things!

[352:45.50]Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit.
[352:48.70]No, I can't ribbit.
[352:49.78]Okay, um, it looks like you have something there.
[352:53.70]Can I have it?
[352:56.28]Yes.
[353:00.98]I love frogs.

[353:07.25]And... You found them all.
[353:18.32]She's taken off the hat!
[353:24.45]The evil frog wizard put a nasty curse on me.
[353:33.77]But thanks to you, I've turned back into a human.
[353:37.05]Yay.
[353:39.79]Jenny?
[353:44.13]What's this?

[354:15.11]How do you do that without yelling loud?
[354:19.21]Thank you for breaking the curse, Chibi.
[354:28.21]This gave you 100 happy points.
[354:32.23]Spread the happiness.
[354:33.52]Hooray!

[354:42.32]You look great!
[354:46.33]Oh, okay.

[355:02.80]Oh, the guy downstairs.
[355:03.78]The guy downstairs.
[355:04.36]There's a guy dying downstairs.

[356:39.86]It's a game that she's playing and there are different spots.
[356:44.22]This is the end game.
[356:45.42]This is just a way for you to load up and mess around.
[356:49.98]It's just extra content for if you feel like playing Chibi-Robo again when you've already done everything.
[356:58.21]I see.
[357:06.09]No, Jerma, it's a curse.
[357:09.06]Right.
[357:11.42]Yeah.
[357:13.74]It's a curse.
[357:24.27]Don't hurt.
[357:27.15]I think I've done that enough times where now when I do it, it actually electrocutes my other eye and hurts me.
[357:35.32]No, the wrong way.
[357:37.32]Back to the fucking kitchen.
[357:42.66]I wasn't even looking at the game, that's why.

[361:38.20]Alright, let's go in the drain.
[361:40.10]It's in the drain.
[361:40.72]Some might say this is a stall.
[361:51.94]You know, you're possibly right.
[361:55.59]I like Chibi-Robo.
[361:56.85]And this is the last time you're going to see it.
[362:00.03]It's kind of sad in a way, you know?

[363:31.24]No, this is the same one, isn't it?
[363:34.65]It has to be a charge shot?
[363:37.27]No, it's in here.
[363:39.03]Okay.
[363:39.31]No?
[364:03.53]Did I get baited, or is this actually really in here?
[364:23.52]Well, I'm almost out of battery power.
[364:24.98]I have to go plug in.
[364:29.14]Hop left.
[364:29.66]Do I have enough battery to get it and go to sleep?
[364:33.27]We'll find out.
[364:34.93]Okay.
[364:35.13]Where is it?
[365:00.37]Ring?
[365:00.83]Down this hole.
[365:01.79]Wasn't I already down here?
[365:43.03]The ring should be down here right at the bottom.
[365:52.02]I don't see a ring.
[365:52.80]I have to talk to the parents first.
[365:56.56]Do I already have it?
[366:00.14]No, no way.
[366:00.76]I didn't get it.
[366:01.34]I didn't accidentally pick this up at some point, did I?
[366:11.76]Yeah, Dad mentioned- he did mention the ring already.
[366:19.63]There it is!
[366:20.23]What do you mean, there it is?
[366:21.23]What?! !
[366:36.94]Not a bug.
[366:37.44]You have to talk to Dad.
[366:38.86]Alright, well, let's go talk to Dad.
[366:48.04]Look, this is a long one anyways.
[366:55.37]What are we at?
[366:55.83]The nine... Nine plus?
[366:57.79]Nine and a half hour mark?
[366:58.61]Eh, I mean, we're doing it.
[367:02.01]Alright, Dad.
[367:02.41]Can we talk?
[367:03.61]I need an outlet.
[367:04.65]The outlet's right behind me.
[367:16.34]But the day ends anyways, fuck.
[367:22.84]Do I have enough time to talk to him?
[367:32.02]Do I have enough time to go talk to dad?
[367:34.36]Come on!
[367:50.89]Hey, what's up?
[367:52.91]Take off the costume.
[367:59.77]Oh, nuts, I'm in the doghouse, Chibi-Robo.
[368:01.28]What am I going to do?
[368:03.30]See, I was busy cleaning, and I accidentally dropped my wedding ring down the drain.
[368:09.70]Chibi-Robo, you gotta get it back for me.
[368:11.52]You gotta get it back.
[368:12.94]Yeah, sure.
[368:17.74]Ah, thanks, you're a lifesaver.
[368:19.50]That's my Chibi-Robo.
[368:23.32]How will you recognize it?
[368:24.56]Oh, I know.
[368:25.16]Our anniversary date is engraved on the inside.
[368:30.67]Perfect.
[368:32.15]And I got the code on my own to get it from chat.
[368:35.45]And that's it.
[368:39.45]We're gonna have to do this tomorrow.
[368:42.93]Big late night bits.
[368:43.97]We got goiki 5,000 bits.
[368:48.78]Thanks for the $50, Goiki.
[368:53.62]5,000 bits for your 5,000 happy points.
[368:55.44]Also, Bugleberry sneezed and you didn't even say bless you.
[368:57.80]Bless you, Bugleberry.
[369:00.87]Thanks for the 5,000 bits, dude.
[369:01.47]Alright, we're actually at the true endgame here.
[369:23.16]I'm gonna puke.
[369:23.88]Please finish.
[369:24.58]Dude, what?
[369:27.01]Go take a shower and go get some food.
[369:43.24]Kitchen.
[369:49.32]I'm a Jermaniac.
[369:52.67]Yeah, but you're also not chained to your desk.
[369:58.68]You can rewind the stream in like 20 minutes.
[370:01.44]Go get some air.
[370:02.10]Alright, we're going to the drain.
[370:14.66]We can only pee when you pee!
[370:16.72]Oh my god, no!
[370:20.87]That's so bad!
[370:28.97]I'm running out of air!
[370:30.38]Oh my god.
[370:33.32]I'm hot.
[370:36.58]I'm going to get this fucking ring.
[370:51.52]Where is it?
[370:52.78]Ring.
[370:56.10]At the bottom, he said, right?
[370:58.85]Is it at the bottom?
[370:59.51]Looking for a ring.
[371:06.19]Found it!
[371:08.35]Haha, invulnerability flames, dickhead.
[371:18.76]it has 2667 engraved on the inside time for the ending cutscene
[371:59.60]Irma, I'm standing in glass.
[372:01.08]Please finish the game.
[372:05.12]Slowly step out.
[372:06.74]And use your hands.
[372:08.16]And get on your knees.
[372:08.96]By hands and knees.
[372:11.72]Don't put any pressure down.
[372:12.66]Alright.
[372:21.33]Thanks for the wedding ring, Dad.
[372:24.25]Goodbye.
[372:29.96]That's not good advice.
[372:31.96]If I was standing in glass, I would not put any pressure down.
[372:34.40]I would slowly move down with my- I would bend my back forward.
[372:39.19]Oh, I'm- wait, hold on.
[372:40.35]Am I- am I in like a box with like glass like squashing grapes?
[372:43.51]How much glass is on the ground?
[372:56.37]The whole floor is glass.
[372:58.92]Um, okay.
[373:02.85]Then, I don't know.
[373:04.47]What would I do if the whole floor was covered in glass?
[373:06.35]I'm not even fighting these guys.
[373:09.65]Wait, broken glass or just glass?
[373:15.32]If it was all broken glass on the ground, I mean, don't you have to... slowly lower your whole body and distribute all your weight across your whole, like, back and shit?
[373:24.54]And, like, how would you do that?
[373:36.42]No, I think the strategy is to just jump in the air and put all your appendages out and land as hard as you can on your back and like button and appendages and shit, right?
[373:49.49]Because then you just get it over with.
[373:53.12]And then you can just get up and fucking run!
[374:06.77]Nice voice crack, I know.
[374:14.53]Nobody even said that, but I agree.
[374:17.39]Alright, what was it?

[376:43.03]What are you doing to Chibi-Robo?
[376:52.47]We'll have to call you Giga-Chibi-Robo.
[376:59.12]Time to go upstairs.
[377:15.74]Time to do what you were programmed to do, Gigarobo.
[377:30.17]Kill all family members.
[377:35.77]What's that?
[377:36.47]What is that?
[377:37.37]Gigarobo, what's that?
[377:38.11]What is that?
[377:46.99]Well, he hasn't spoken in a long time.
[378:08.65]His vocal cords need time to warm up.
[378:17.26]One more.
[378:20.46]Oh.
[378:24.26]I thought I was going to do it a fourth time.
[378:30.92]Lock and load.
[378:31.54]Enemy approaching.
[378:44.31]Sweet bazooka casserole.
[378:47.83]Is that Gigarobo?
[379:02.58]Cease fire, you moron!
[379:04.84]Huh?
[379:06.42]I'm sorry!

[379:14.79]Company, salute!
[379:17.73]Yes, sir.
[379:25.46]He's going all this way.
[379:27.70]He's going right to the bathroom.
[379:30.74]Oh, Gigarobo, where are you going?
[379:32.38]Me too.
[379:36.61]Evacuate.
[379:46.02]Well, what do you... Oh, look it!
[379:46.94]Look, look, look, look!
[379:52.22]Oh, it's like a father and son.

[380:05.75]And Funky... Funky Frank!
[380:12.15]He sure is a small one.
[380:15.11]Keep on rockin', big man!
[380:18.15]Oh, all the characters are saying goodbye.
[380:29.87]Good evening, citizen.
[380:39.47]I'm Ron Brokjaw for Fox News.
[380:42.77]Our country has recently been consumed by the white-hot fires of Chibi-Robo mania.
[380:47.99]And whether you know it or not, this passion casts a dark shadow on our everyday life.
[380:52.68]We now go live to Sunny Mary, where there's sunny... Ron, I'm coming to you live from in front of something.
[381:01.53]This new Chibi-Robo mania brings more than clean floors and clutter-free lives.
[381:07.11]It is also placing a severe demand on the local power supply.
[381:11.77]Sources tell Fox News that if Chibi-Robos continue to fly off the shelves on the Wi-Fi, power demand will outstrip supply and send the region into a panic of unfathomable panic.
[381:22.68]We predict rioting, looting, and perhaps the end of civilization if we know it, Ron.
[381:28.08]A dire prediction indeed.
[381:28.98]Thank you, Sonny.
[381:30.00]Global citizens' continued use of Chibi-Robo appears both dangerous and foolhardy.
[381:36.45]What will you do?
[381:42.15]What would you do, honey?
[381:45.43]I'd turn into Drake Redcrest and save the world.
[381:47.35]Yeah, of course.
[381:48.89]Not in a fucking cartoon.
[381:49.87]Like, in real life.
[381:50.61]Like, real shit's happening right now.
[381:52.37]Please pay attention.
[381:55.27]Abnormal activity detected.
[381:56.71]Tonight, we ride Space Hunter Drake Redcrest away.
[382:08.48]my husband's such a geek oh my gosh giga robo I haven't seen you in such a long time rip it rip it I'm telling you he's oh
[382:39.66]What's wrong with you?
[382:43.11]You reactivated him, right?
[382:44.63]Right?
[382:49.09]Classic.
[382:50.75]Oh, for Pete's sake.
[382:57.66]He wants to go visit his alien friends.
[383:00.80]But it's not nighttime, Icarobo.
[383:02.84]This is not gonna work.
[383:04.94]And plus, they're all sick, and they all have like a fever.
[383:08.36]They're all... Trust me, I just saw them.
[383:20.09]Oh!
[383:20.85]Shit.
[383:21.57]Okay, they're gonna give the powers... They made a power source.
[383:24.91]That is a completely sustainable energy for all humans and every living thing.
[383:29.05]And they're gonna give it to... That's what they're coming back for.
[383:31.79]To give.
[383:33.45]Right.
[383:35.34]Okay.
[383:38.36]And they promised they were going to give it to him.
[383:48.74]Friend!
[383:49.82]Friend!

[389:49.78]Giga Robo?
[389:53.46]You're out of juice!
[389:57.18]Infinity?
[389:58.04]You don't need energy anymore?
[390:08.37]You too, Chibi-Robo?
[390:11.11]Now throw me away.

[391:53.20]Are they still in charge of this?
[392:00.34]No.
[392:00.90]Who owns it?
[392:01.36]No.
[392:05.54]Who's my favorite character?

[392:20.09]Alright, let's see.
[392:25.82]Good morning.
[392:30.33]Looking pretty good at this rate.
[392:32.55]Making number one won't be any problem at all.

[393:50.08]It's just an S. Is it?
[393:54.18]There's no big cape or anything?
[393:59.94]I'm the best Chibi-Robo in the world, and I just have... It's a button that you get... It's a pants button.
[394:08.67]What is the pose?
[394:10.35]Chibi-Robo.

[398:39.70]Alright, what do you gotta say?
[398:41.66]Chibi-Robo, Giga-Robo, you'll both get wet if you stay there.
[398:45.61]Alright, Dad doesn't care.
[398:47.39]We're gonna pose anyways.
[398:54.81]Sorry, Chibi-Robo.
[398:55.99]I'm busy today.
[398:56.85]We saved the fucking world.
[398:59.54]And then don't matter.
[399:00.30]I'm busy.
[399:02.48]What about you?
[399:08.20]Swing!
[399:10.77]Are you two having any fun?
[399:12.21]It's kind of hard to tell.
[399:13.09]Jigarobo is having lots of fun.
[399:24.56]Wait.
[399:35.06]Wait, Gigarobo is now getting all the attention His power is fucking endless
[400:09.04]Oh yeah, Dad?
[400:43.00]See you guys later.
[400:49.48]What about mom?
[400:53.88]I don't know where mom is.
[400:55.82]Alright, I'm gonna read the bits while I go look for mom.
[401:01.98]And if I find mom, I will pull it back.
[401:04.22]What time is it?
[401:07.32]12.15.
[401:07.36]This is a long one.
[401:10.63]So I'll be live tomorrow.
[401:13.96]Uh, we're probably gonna start a little later tomorrow.
[401:17.38]I have a couple things I have to do in the afternoon.
[401:20.02]So instead of 2, we'll probably start around... Maybe 3 or 4?
[401:28.19]3.30 or something?
[401:28.57]4 o'clock?
[401:32.73]I have some things I gotta do in the afternoon.
[401:37.27]Sick.
[401:39.55]But let's, uh, let's go back.
[401:40.49]I'm gonna try to go to Mom's room while I read some of these bits.
[401:44.96]Thanks for joining me.
[401:47.16]We'll see you tomorrow.
[401:48.84]Thanks a lot, guys.
[401:51.42]PB Rebel was fantastic.
[401:53.36]I'm really glad I experienced it.
[401:55.28]Glad I finished it.
[401:58.46]It's a very addicting game.
[401:59.68]They put a lot of little carrots in front of you.
[402:02.92]I like games like this.
[402:03.87]I really do.
[402:08.59]I like the carrot on the stick game.
[402:11.71]They're a lot of fun.
[402:15.41]But let's do the bits here.
[402:18.07]Let's go back.
[402:20.13]I'm going to actually try to go through these fairly quickly because we've been going on 10 hours here and it's very, very late.
[402:26.35]So I'm not going to be like, hey, let me... We're just going to go through them and say our hellos.
[402:39.09]Like I'm not going to, you know, go off on some kind of, you know, like I just did.
[402:46.35]No democratic debate.
[402:48.87]No.
[402:49.79]No, I don't even know what that means.
[402:50.85]Uh, Pugles, thanks for the 400 bits.
[402:52.91]Also, you were like 6'5", and very intimidating.
[403:14.88]Well, if I walked out of my... Alright, that makes sense.
[403:17.04]If I walked out of my streamer room, in quotes, and there was a person I have never met before and I don't know, playing with my dog with a dog in the house, I would be like, what's going on?
[403:29.21]Who are you?
[403:31.55]That's pretty accurate.
[403:33.33]How's that lore?
[403:34.11]That's lore?
[403:39.57]Oh, that's scary!
[403:47.36]There's somebody in my house.
[403:48.64]I don't know who this bad person is.
[403:54.18]How's that lore?
[403:59.55]Lore can be scary.
[404:00.89]Quick, edit the wiki.
[404:02.79]Oh my god.
[404:05.11]Oh, 6-5.
[404:05.41]Is that the lore you're talking about?
[404:06.85]You're going to make the nightmares worse, Jeremy.
[404:11.57]I got it.
[404:11.96]I'll be fine.
[404:14.22]Thanks for the 400 bits, and weird dream.
[404:16.98]Weird dream.
[404:17.32]I hope our dogs got along, though.
[404:20.46]Uh, Sir Canine, thanks for the $5.
[404:22.10]They did a, they tried to do a Money Jupiter.
[404:24.16]I don't know if it worked or not.
[404:25.25]Let's hope it did.
[404:27.33]Uh, Cell Juniors, thanks for the 300 bits.
[404:29.67]Jeremy, my payment for the last chat didn't clear.
[404:32.37]I know a lot of the other paid chat members are having the same problem.
[404:35.49]This is the third time this month.
[404:36.65]Come on, man.
[404:37.19]Paid chat member.
[404:43.84]Gnarly, thanks for the 250, Gnarly.
[404:45.30]Hey, a while back you told me that you would give me a private Hearthstone stream.
[404:48.44]I was wondering when you wanted to do that.
[404:49.69]I'm not available tomorrow or Saturday.
[404:51.67]But Sunday I'm free.
[404:52.53]I'm very excited.
[404:59.60]JermaSucks gave 50 fucking community subs we had we had Sukhoi Flanker gave like four or five hundred dollars really wanted me to play stalker I don't know if that's gonna happen, but I really appreciate the absurd amount of money Hb12 what a name thanks to the 500 bits
[405:27.32]I'm glad, Jeremy, I'm glad you're having fun with Chibi-Robo.
[405:29.79]It's my favorite game and it's stayed very close to my heart all these years.
[405:34.17]It's even what I named myself after.
[405:35.89]That's your name.
[405:36.45]It's been a rad experience watching my favorite streamer play it and it's kept me sane for a couple rough days.
[405:41.86]Thank you.
[405:42.20]Yeah, the game's fucking awesome.
[405:44.04]It's a wonderful game.
[405:45.84]I would love a 2020 version of Chibi-Robo.
[405:49.50]A real one.
[405:49.97]Put it on the Switch and update it and make the house four times as big.
[406:01.00]I would love a Chibi-Robo Switch with just a bigger house and more stuff to do.
[406:06.87]Or just, yeah, put it on PC.
[406:08.63]It's not even a Nintendo brand at this point.
[406:10.49]I mean, it is, but... What is it, on the DS and the GameCube?
[406:17.89]Breath of the Chibi.
[406:19.01]That's correct.
[406:21.43]B.F. Bugleberry.
[406:22.52]I don't know why you have that name.
[406:25.30]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[406:26.24]Holding your internet hostage until we get a Bugleberry emote.
[406:30.38]Um...
[406:32.64]Still alive.
[406:34.94]Thanks for the $5.
[406:37.54]Sir Canine, thanks for the $2.50.
[406:38.88]I'm glad to hear you'd be willing to play some more variety of games.
[406:44.23]I personally can't wait for the... That's not what I'm playing.
[406:49.63]Thanks for the $2.50.
[406:50.09]Hey, Cream Corn, thanks for the $2.50.
[406:51.09]Our new... Cheeky Breaky...
[407:01.98]IV... Dom... Domkey?
[407:07.93]Thanks for the... Thanks, CreamCorn, for the 250.
[407:09.43]I don't know what that is.
[407:10.51]I have no idea what that is.
[407:11.31]Hey, LuigiMan, thanks for the 250.
[407:13.55]Why is it in 10-minute slow-mode?
[407:15.15]Because I... I said so.
[407:18.93]It's all that it needs to have.
[407:21.02]Power, power, power, power.
[407:24.24]Uh, thanks for the 250.
[407:27.50]TheManWithTheBabyHands, thanks for the 600 bits.
[407:30.46]Don't play, stalker.
[407:33.22]I don't have a plan to.
[407:34.12]I want to make that very clear.
[407:35.10]Uh, the man with the baby hands again gave another $4.80.
[407:38.66]I will give you money if I want to.
[407:41.54]Yes.
[407:42.76]I will accept any money that anybody gives this stream.
[407:45.60]I just want to... I just want you to know that I would... I feel more comfortable if people give money to this stream if they can afford it.
[407:54.94]I know people joke around sometimes, but I don't want people to be feeding this stream money because they think they have to.
[408:03.85]You don't have to.
[408:08.39]If you feel like giving this channel money, and you have the disposable income, and it's... You want to do that, by all means do it.
[408:16.97]I will take it.
[408:17.91]I'm not going to... What am I going to be like?
[408:19.21]No!
[408:20.57]But at the same time, I do want to make it... Please take care of yourselves.
[408:25.64]Don't put yourself in any danger or problems because you're paying a bunch of money that you can't afford.
[408:33.44]Just be careful.
[408:37.59]If it means you choosing yourself or me to take care of and give money to, please choose yourself first every time.
[408:51.40]Thank you, though.
[408:53.56]You brought us years of entertainment.
[408:57.17]Yeah, I mean, if you... It's optional.
[409:01.47]Any of the money that comes in here is optional.
[409:04.21]So, don't...
[409:08.50]I mean, it's not like I'm going to tell anybody that they have to subscribe or give any money.
[409:14.06]It's just optional.
[409:14.88]If you feel like it, do it.
[409:16.04]If you don't, then don't.
[409:23.95]How much goes to Bugleberry?
[409:24.99]$40.
[409:25.11]I paid him one time.
[409:27.49]Three years ago.
[409:37.74]Trust me, you do not want to owe Jerma.
[409:42.22]Hey, we had a $30 donation.
[409:43.56]We had 3,000 bits from Dad Jeff.
[409:48.33]$30.
[409:48.61]Stay strong and don't negotiate with terrorists, King.
[409:53.11]Thank you for the $30.
[409:53.69]I really appreciate it.
[409:57.63]That's a lot of money.
[409:58.63]A lot of fucking money.
[410:01.51]King.
[410:01.79]There's the King again.
[410:02.73]King.
[410:03.25]King.
[410:04.49]Do that, King.
[410:05.13]I don't... I've seen that lately.
[410:09.14]Thank you so much for the 30 bucks.
[410:12.90]Uh, Sakasa0, thanks for the 1,000 bits.
[410:15.20]10 bucks.
[410:15.72]This is literally the last of my checking account.
[410:17.64]I'm literally going to starve to death and die.
[410:19.88]Have a good stream.
[410:27.00]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[410:28.38]Thanks for the 1,000 bits.
[410:29.94]And, well, thanks a lot.
[410:31.54]Thank you.
[410:31.98]Have a great night.
[410:35.11]Uh, Greedy is good, thanks for the 500 bits.
[410:37.35]All this stock trading to go into more auto streams.
[410:43.40]Thank you.
[410:46.34]Thanks for the five bucks.
[410:49.20]Uh, Dad Jeff again gave 15 more dollars on top of the 30.
[410:53.04]This is 4,500 bits.
[410:54.46]This is 4,500.
[410:55.64]This is $45 total from Dad Jeff.
[410:59.25]Don't mind me investing in streamer coin.
[411:03.09]Is that a real thing?
[411:08.68]Somebody probably made it in 2017 during the big explosion, you know what I mean?
[411:12.85]I wouldn't be surprised.
[411:14.83]Thanks for the 15 bucks.
[411:17.27]Appreciate it.
[411:21.00]Just kidding.
[411:31.95]Miss Jackie CR, thanks for the 500 bits.
[411:34.39]Jerma, I'm so excited for you to play Mario Sunshine.
[411:37.39]It's one of my favorite games, and having my favorite streamer is a huge plus.
[411:41.79]I'm looking forward to it a lot, too, because it's one of the only Mario games I've never played.
[411:46.82]And I really mean never even played it once.
[411:53.52]I have never held a controller and moved Mario around even 10 feet ever in Mario Sunshine.
[412:03.27]It's my actual completely blind first time ever playing the game.
[412:07.81]I can't wait.
[412:09.23]I'm not sure how the hell it's gone this far without me doing it.
[412:16.63]Looks fun.
[412:19.97]Have I seen it?
[412:20.71]I mean, I've seen... I've seen... You know, you clean the mud on the ground and you can hover with the water tank.
[412:30.16]I have these little snippets of random gameplay that I've seen.
[412:35.59]I've never played it.
[412:36.25]He got spoiled.
[412:42.71]Hold on, Mr. Sark.
[412:45.89]What's going on, Sark?
[412:47.24]Sark just said, thanks for the five dollars, Sark.
[412:49.76]I just mugged that starving guy who donated.
[412:53.32]Uh, he had these 500 bits hidden in his shoe.
[412:55.74]No one holds out on Jerma.
[412:57.24]Oh my god.
[413:05.64]But yeah, I mean, thank you, though.
[413:06.56]Thanks for doing that.
[413:09.48]What's going on, Sark?
[413:15.36]Sark, what time is it where you are right now?
[413:17.46]It's late, isn't it?
[413:18.64]Isn't it like 3 a.m.?
[413:22.82]Ask Sark when he's streaming again.
[413:24.07]Sark, when are you streaming again?
[413:25.81]We're all waiting.
[413:28.91]It's 2.30 in Texas.
[413:30.21]Oh, okay.
[413:35.43]Fucking never.
[413:39.37]We're all waiting for the next one.
[413:44.23]Well, everybody follow Sark for when he turns the stream on at some point.
[413:55.33]Anyways.
[413:57.65]Immortal Dracolich.
[414:01.63]$15.
[414:01.65]1500 bits from Immortal Dracolich.
[414:04.37]Thanks a lot.
[414:06.67]Thank you, thank you.
[414:07.25]Hey Jerma, I'm a college student going into grad school.
[414:09.93]I just got accepted for a scholarship that would pay for 75% of my tuition for my masters.
[414:14.33]That's fucking pretty good.
[414:16.23]Just want to give back to the stream and say thanks for all the tough weeks that you helped me pull through.
[414:21.42]That's pretty good.
[414:22.22]That's pretty good.
[414:23.98]Nice.
[414:25.12]Good shit.
[414:28.88]75% of your tuition.
[414:32.08]Hell yeah.
[414:34.54]Nice fucking job.
[414:37.58]Congratulations.
[414:39.94]And thanks for the 15 bucks.
[414:42.28]I'll take it.
[414:44.02]Thanks a lot.
[414:46.23]Bravo, bravo.
[414:49.21]Let's get the credits to roll.
[414:54.49]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[414:56.21]Not exactly sure what we're playing, but we've got a lot of things here.
[415:00.19]I want it to be something we can do in a fairly short amount of time.
[415:04.25]This tomorrow's stream is starting a little later, so it's not going to go as late
[415:09.75]So, something we can do in probably under six hours.
[415:13.29]Something like five to seven hours, something like that.
[415:14.87]It's not going to be a super long one tomorrow.
[415:19.27]Let me get the credits rolling, though.
[415:21.08]There were a lot of community subs tonight, so there's going to be a lot of names running by.
[415:30.55]Start Sunshine.
[415:31.61]Nah, yeah.
[415:32.67]Start Sunshine.
[415:33.31]Right.
[415:33.81]Yeah.
[415:34.89]I'm not gonna play Sunshine on the first time I start it for like four hours.
[415:39.13]No, that's not happening.
[415:42.09]Here they come.
[415:44.25]Oh, right.
[415:44.69]We did it.
[415:44.95]We had a shitload of community subs, but they all got cut off by the internet turning off.
[415:50.92]So we got... Still a lot of people.
[415:58.92]Yeah, there was like 100 community subs or something.
[416:01.70]50 to 100 before, right?
[416:03.78]Yeah.
[416:04.70]It got cut off from the internet turning off.
[416:07.70]Secret subs.
[416:09.51]Secret subs.
[416:15.57]Anyways, thank you guys, all of you.
[416:18.21]Sorry we're missing some of you.
[416:20.83]Three hours of this stream was deleted.
[416:23.33]Well, it's a VOD, but... The uptime is misleading.
[416:27.65]It's been about ten hours.
[416:30.69]But thanks, everybody.
[416:32.63]Thanks for subbing.
[416:33.37]Thanks for the community subs.
[416:34.65]And thanks for all the fucking money!
[416:36.16]The stream sees a lot of it, so thank you.
[416:39.70]We're gonna finish up the bits.
[416:41.78]We'll get some sleep, and I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[416:46.60]Still a few more to do.
[416:49.65]Hey, Clink!
[416:50.21]Thanks, Clink, for the five bucks.
[416:52.03]Hi, me again from two streams ago saying I was looking forward to Chibi-Robo since it's my favorite game ever.
[416:57.19]The Cooking Mama stream was still a blast, and I'm glad you're enjoying the game as much as you are.
[417:02.35]Hearing you say that this game is amazing single-handedly made my whole week.
[417:05.81]Thanks for having such a great personality always.
[417:07.58]You're a real inspiration.
[417:10.08]I mean, it's just good.
[417:11.64]The game is great.
[417:14.70]I'm a... I'm a piece of glass.
[417:16.46]You can see right through me.
[417:18.10]So, I... I love it.
[417:19.98]I think it's great.
[417:25.05]Thanks a lot for the five dollars.
[417:26.13]Hope you enjoyed it.
[417:27.27]It is a very, very, very impressive, fun, adorable, great game.
[417:33.53]I did not find mom.
[417:34.99]Unfortunately, it's been paused the whole time.
[417:40.83]Someone push him on the ground.
[417:45.88]Hey, whoa, me?
[417:50.52]Why would you push me on the ground?
[417:55.08]Someone push him on the ground.
[417:56.64]What the fuck?
[418:01.70]Hey, disinterest thanks to the 250.
[418:03.90]Hey, Jenga.
[418:04.52]Do you have a favorite non-video game?
[418:07.18]Like a board or a card game?
[418:13.48]I really like Risk.
[418:15.81]Although Risk is kind of... turtle-y.
[418:19.85]I do think Risk is fun.
[418:23.43]Monopoly is really fun, too.
[418:25.15]I just love Monopoly.
[418:27.09]You like Risk?
[418:28.07]Yeah, I know.
[418:28.99]No, no, no.
[418:29.89]Let me... Okay, hold on.
[418:30.79]Let me rephrase this.
[418:31.95]I like the first 45 minutes of Risk.
[418:37.00]Everything else after the first 45 minutes sucks.
[418:46.02]But I don't really play any card games.
[418:48.90]Well, do you want to get literal with this?
[418:53.03]Poker.
[418:53.97]Blackjack.
[418:56.25]I like those kind of card games.
[418:58.05]They're interesting to me.
[419:00.65]Does this count?
[419:04.68]Poker can be interesting to play.
[419:07.30]Let me, like, text Holdem.
[419:08.78]I'm just dicking around.
[419:13.09]That's gambling.
[419:13.79]Well, it's a card game.
[419:15.79]You can play poker with your friends.
[419:18.45]And gamble like Oreos.
[419:19.87]I used to do it all the time.
[419:29.91]Friends in quotes.
[419:31.81]You're on fire.
[419:32.87]You're on fire tonight.
[419:39.91]But yeah, I don't play very many game card games.
[419:46.12]But I do like poker cards, like playing cards.
[419:51.48]I do like some of those games.
[419:56.88]Anyways.
[419:58.40]Alright, thank you for the 250.
[420:17.95]What?
[420:18.83]Why are you saying sorry at the end?
[420:20.71]Thanks for the metal socks.
[420:21.69]Thanks for the $30.
[420:23.29]Thanks for the 3,000 bits.
[420:47.72]I meant to say, thank you Metal Socks for the 3,000 bits.
[420:51.96]Why are you still alive?
[420:57.22]I think you meant to say... You put an A in there.
[421:01.24]Remember, why are you still alive?
[421:02.98]Right?
[421:03.16]Because it's been like 10 hours.
[421:04.46]That's what you meant to do?
[421:06.31]I hope you corrected.
[421:09.61]Otherwise... Boink!
[421:20.67]Why are we alive?
[421:24.21]Oh no, mocha ass.
[421:30.00]Are you eating in or out like Burgah Boy?
[421:31.92]Laughing my ass off.
[421:34.68]It is late, fuck.
[421:39.40]That's a great question.
[421:41.84]Find out in a second.
[421:43.84]Alex just asked me that.
[421:45.84]We'll see in about 10 minutes.
[421:49.11]Grim is gambling our bits away as we speak.
[421:51.21]I cannot put my phone down.
[421:52.31]What are you talking about?
[421:53.01]You didn't hear... What?
[421:57.91]What are you talking about?
[422:00.58]Can I hold that for a second?
[422:01.82]The river's coming.
[422:02.60]Hold on.
[422:07.66]Shit.
[422:14.42]Bless me.
[422:15.40]Bless you, Bugleberry.
[422:16.58]I didn't know you were still in the room.
[422:19.35]Hey Dubski dude, thanks for the 250.
[422:20.83]Thanks for the 250 Dubski.
[422:24.36]Why would they lie to me?
[422:25.96]Why would they lie to me?
[422:26.90]How dare they?
[422:51.95]We'll see.
[422:52.95]Tomorrow might just be a stream where I do a few things that I should probably clean up.
[422:58.67]I can't say for sure.
[423:01.10]We'll see.
[423:01.62]We'll see.
[423:07.18]Princess Maker 2.
[423:09.56]Um, I don't have that.
[423:11.46]Don't have that game.
[423:13.82]Hey Mitchell, thanks for the five dollars, Mitchell.
[423:16.03]500 bits.
[423:16.45]I just want to say I was sound asleep when the sneezing joke started.
[423:19.09]The sneezes woke me up.
[423:20.55]And I was really fucking confused.
[423:29.08]Sorry.
[423:31.47]Clink, thanks for the 500 bits.
[423:33.53]Five dollars from Clink.
[423:34.49]Fun fact about the serpent.
[423:36.44]The sergeant.
[423:37.96]The sergeant of the egghead's voice sample.
[423:41.46]It's actually from Monty Python's The Meaning of Life.
[423:43.52]You can hear it right here in this clip.
[423:45.38]No shit.
[423:48.01]This is a Rick Roll.
[423:48.83]I'm turning the stream off.
[423:50.87]It's not okay.
[423:51.29]Good.
[424:03.52]Is it really?
[424:09.19]Is it?
[424:12.05]What the fuck?
[424:21.49]It is just random weird samples.
[424:23.87]You can hear words and then they cut it off.
[424:26.05]It's weird.
[424:29.74]Interesting tidbit though.
[424:36.41]Thank you.
[424:39.23]Hey, Brewster Pigeon, thanks for the 500 bits.
[424:43.17]Thanks so much for playing ChibiRoboDerma.
[424:44.67]I run a ChibiRobo Twitter and Discord and you playing it is bringing a lot of new fans.
[424:49.48]Means a lot, thanks so much.
[424:50.66]I mean, the game should have a lot of fans.
[424:56.02]I'm a fan now.
[424:58.60]I'm gonna go get a pot from downstairs and put it on my head and walk around.
[425:02.94]And like, plug my ass into outlets.
[425:06.22]I'm going to pretend.
[425:06.80]I'm not going to do that last part, though.
[425:09.12]That's dangerous.
[425:15.32]Thank you for the 500 bits.
[425:16.86]And finally, at the end of the night, we'll see you tomorrow.
[425:21.71]Have a good night.
[425:24.97]Calactus gave 500 bits.
[425:26.91]Thanks, Jerma, for evenings full of laughter these past few months.
[425:29.11]Without you, there wouldn't have been much of it.
[425:31.63]Keep up the good work, as always, and I can't wait to see what you play next.
[425:35.02]We'll see what we do tomorrow.
[425:38.12]I'm open to suggestions tomorrow, because I want to just chill.
[425:44.86]We'll see.
[425:45.20]Have a great rest of your night.
[425:47.90]Get some sleep.
[425:48.48]I know we went pretty late tonight.
[425:50.90]Kind of a long one, but, you know, it happens sometimes.
[425:54.79]See you guys tomorrow.
[425:56.69]Good night.
[425:57.23]Goodbye.
[425:57.59]Take care.
[426:38.57]you
[427:11.27]Thank you.
