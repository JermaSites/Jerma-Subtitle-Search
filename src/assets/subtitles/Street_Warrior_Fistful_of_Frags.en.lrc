[01:05.48]hi enjoying the uh opening ceremonies I can't breathe sorry that was uncalled for good evening good evening it's it's morning still not even noon yet it'll be noon soon
[01:39.12]Thank you, Minkfur.
[01:41.24]Minkfur for nine months, cool.
[01:43.24]And Joho, PETA, thanks, guys.
[01:47.54]Alright, so, here's what we're gonna do today.
[01:55.13]Two musics?
[01:55.73]There's two musics going on?
[01:56.81]There shouldn't be.
[01:57.29]Maybe it's because this piece of shit game in the background is playing its dumb song and maybe it's coming through.
[02:07.88]I guess that's what's going on.
[02:11.39]That is what's going on.
[02:15.81]Oh, well.
[02:18.73]So, let me turn... Speaking of terrible fucking music that needs to be turned off, this is one of them.
[02:24.82]Shut up.
[02:28.70]Welcome to a Sunday stream.
[02:32.64]We don't typically do Sunday streams, but sometimes we do.
[02:35.26]What?
[02:37.53]So, I still don't feel well at all.
[02:39.51]I'm still... Ow, I'm making like a concert over here.
[02:43.83]Makeup stream?
[02:44.41]Yeah, this is a makeup stream from Thursday.
[02:46.40]And we're gonna play this game that I saw on Steam.
[02:52.70]It's free to play.
[02:53.46]I suggest you go get it.
[02:55.56]I think it's not even like a gigabyte.
[02:58.16]It's like a street fighting game.
[03:00.60]It's gonna be fun.
[03:01.40]It's gonna be funny.
[03:02.23]It's like physics based.
[03:03.37]Who knows?
[03:04.07]Probably, it might be a piece of total shit.
[03:07.56]But... Make sure if you download this game, I'm going to encourage you to do, for the sake of being able just to play on stream.
[03:14.58]We're gonna play it for a little bit.
[03:16.29]Pick United States as your country.
[03:21.13]Because then when we queue up here, when we hit fight, we can actually queue into each other.
[03:24.91]Because I don't think there's like an actual lobby system that's in the game.
[03:31.47]How is it a makeup stream if we can't see your makeup?
[03:34.70]Yeah, this is a makeup tutorial stream!
[03:38.91]Oh boy, there's no borderless window in this game either.
[03:41.12]This is going to drive me nuts.
[03:45.92]But thank you to all the people that are trickling in here.
[03:48.98]ItTheCats, thanks for the sub.
[03:50.14]MrSamMid for three months.
[03:52.50]Thanks a lot, guys.
[03:53.26]And then BitsFahrenheit with five bucks.
[03:56.46]Jeremy, can you say shoo shoo stroke?
[03:59.79]Shoo shoo.
[04:02.79]My mom had a stroke and I've been missing your streams.
[04:05.03]Jeez, man, that's terrible.
[04:07.49]Sorry to hear that.
[04:12.37]Uh, hopefully she gets well soon, dude.
[04:14.01]If that is, uh, the case.
[04:16.05]My condolences to you.
[04:18.91]Uh, never trust a purple.
[04:19.63]Thank you also for the 500, the 5 bucks.
[04:21.43]Dermal, please.
[04:22.47]Trying to watch Dignitas versus G2 right now.
[04:25.81]Go offline for like 15 more minutes.
[04:28.05]No.
[04:29.05]No, we're going live now.
[04:30.67]We're going live right now.
[04:36.96]We're not, we ain't, we ain't stopping for nothing.
[04:41.59]I probably sound worse than I did, like, two days ago also.
[04:44.79]Probably, right?
[04:46.93]It, like, won't go away.
[04:53.64]It's the worst thing ever.
[04:58.36]Big fan from Costa Rica?
[04:59.38]Well, welcome from Costa Rica, dude.
[05:05.07]Why is this... What is going on?
[05:09.51]Why?
[05:09.75]I just had to hit this.
[05:10.77]Doesn't I have an alarm on my phone right now?
[05:13.79]For what?
[05:16.29]Did I set an alarm for 12 o'clock?
[05:19.88]I definitely did not do that.
[05:23.50]Hey, Greg Fest.
[05:25.16]Thanks for the sub, dude.
[05:26.82]Alright, so I'm going to queue.
[05:28.16]This is... I don't know what to expect from this game.
[05:31.30]I'm actually going to stall a little bit longer just so more of you can download the game because it is free to play.
[05:36.95]It's completely free.
[05:38.01]You make a character.
[05:38.93]You can pick his, like, clothes and shit.
[05:41.70]But who really cares?
[05:42.66]None of this really matters.
[05:45.02]These cost money.
[05:46.22]Ah, that's too bad.
[05:49.44]I can't put him in, like, a suit.
[05:51.17]I need more money.
[05:51.93]Am I playing as the Doomguy?
[05:56.33]No, this is Large Marge.
[06:05.08]You're telling me I can't even be bare-chested in this game?
[06:07.93]It costs $75,000 to have no chest?
[06:12.67]We're going to be this fucking gray guy.
[06:14.93]Who cares?
[06:17.91]Regular Adidas sweatpants.
[06:20.32]That works for me.
[06:22.70]What am I downloading?
[06:25.52]You're downloading Street Warriors Online.
[06:28.82]The newest title from... I don't know who the dev is at all.
[06:34.63]All I know about this game is it's eight versus eight mayhem.
[06:40.34]That's all I know.
[06:42.12]I watched the trailer and I was like, alright, you know, kind of.
[06:44.86]If I'm going to do a makeup stream, it's going to have to be this.
[06:50.12]And I'm going to cough.
[06:51.64]No, I'm not.
[06:52.57]Maybe I will.
[07:00.03]I'm fine.
[07:00.51]Don't worry.
[07:03.19]So many microtransactions.
[07:05.79]I don't know how, considering it's... It doesn't seem like there's very much to this game.
[07:12.31]But I wonder if, uh... How many people have it at the moment?
[07:16.45]Have enough people bought this game?
[07:18.51]Where we can play it?
[07:20.25]There's, like, power cards for weapons and you can do, like, you can set your combos.
[07:26.15]I already set mine as fucking just Brock Lesnar haymakers.
[07:30.01]That's what my guy does.
[07:30.95]You better be on the lookout for the guy that does this shit.
[07:39.77]you're not gonna leave the windmill there's like kicks and shit too this game always freezes when I'm done making a character oh shit sorry to hear that man at least your PC can handle this game
[08:05.34]Uh, Dooley8, thank you Dooley8 for the sub.
[08:07.64]And Bratcherlev3months, welcome back.
[08:12.00]And welcome to nutterboot, nutterbutt, for two months.
[08:16.10]Alright, you guys ready?
[08:17.96]I'm just gonna queue, so if I get in a game with you, then that's what happens.
[08:21.72]Let's go for it.
[08:22.36]This is- I have eight on eight.
[08:24.86]Skirmish.
[08:27.80]Queue up for eight on eight skirmish right now.
[08:31.98]We're gonna kick some ass.
[08:40.53]Why is this game so good?
[08:41.67]We don't know that yet.
[08:43.39]We are unaware of that.
[08:48.03]That is to be determined.
[08:51.79]I do have these really long gorilla arms, don't I?
[08:56.46]Oh, here we go.
[08:57.74]Three and a four, what?
[09:00.76]Where's the eight?
[09:01.74]Where's the eight players?
[09:02.94]I didn't want to do four players, I wanted to do eight.
[09:06.42]Whatever, I'll just kick these guys' asses, it's fine.
[09:17.07]24-hour stream in lobby confirmed.
[09:20.33]Oh, wait.
[09:21.31]Two versus two.
[09:22.50]Octagon.
[09:24.34]Let's just go for it.
[09:25.72]We'll just do 2v2.
[09:28.78]In, like, the octagon.
[09:29.96]Where am I?
[09:35.05]What the fuck is going on?
[09:39.51]Beat all opponents from the other team.
[09:40.83]Surviving team wins the round.
[09:43.31]What the fuck?
[09:47.34]Why are these guys moving together as one collective unit?
[09:51.20]They're gone.
[09:51.92]They're gone.
[09:52.68]Those guys are gone.
[09:55.14]I won.
[09:57.56]I win.
[10:06.20]Alright, I don't have a teammate.
[10:08.39]It's too loud.
[10:09.31]It's so loud.
[10:13.77]Why do I have 2v1?
[10:14.97]This is bullshit.
[10:35.85]Wait, turn the fucking volume down!
[10:38.53]It's so loud!
[10:40.85]That didn't do anything!
[10:42.01]That didn't do anything!
[10:44.23]It didn't fucking do anything, this is so stupid!
[10:47.76]Where's my fucking teammate?
[10:51.06]Ooh, wait a second, somebody learned how to play.
[10:56.88]Alright, this is not fucking fair.
[10:59.30]Look at all that blood.
[11:00.83]This shit's not fair.
[11:03.15]It's so... I can't turn it down.
[11:10.63]Wait, now there's no punch sounds.
[11:32.42]I don't understand.
[11:35.08]What the hell just happened?
[11:37.36]Anybody have any idea what just happened?
[11:46.95]Yeah, fuck that was not fair Okay, well obviously I'm gonna have to do this I have to go in like my mixer and turn this fucking thing down Hold on You can add people as friends how the why well any like oh shit alright, let's add some friends You guys have any in-game names
[12:15.29]Throw me some in-game names.
[12:17.07]And I'll add you.
[12:17.69]And we'll try to get like eight people in the same game.
[12:22.63]But let me turn the volume mixer down on this stupid piece of shit.
[12:29.91]Because that was insane.
[12:31.17]I couldn't even hear myself think.
[12:32.31]Alright, that should be better.
[12:36.62]That's not gonna like blow all our eardrums out.
[12:38.54]Alright, let's get some people in here.
[12:48.54]uh did I get that right the legend 27 alright let's see uh can the mods do me a favor and do the same thing that because it's almost impossible for me to alt tab and do this if you can send me the pms with people that are saying what their in-game names are let's click skirmish under fight button there should be different modes
[13:14.25]Yeah, there's different modes, but, um... See, like, 8 versus 8?
[13:17.69]I, like, had that selected.
[13:20.53]I got a max map size.
[13:22.51]Okay, so it might just put people in random stuff, I guess.
[13:31.92]Yeah, if, uh... I'm trying to alt-tab, and it's just kind of killing my computer.
[13:37.04]So if any, like I said, mods could just whisper me people's in-game names.
[13:41.45]I feel like this is going to be a lot of fun.
[13:43.43]I have very high hopes for this game after what just happened right there.
[13:49.85]So... Well, I just hurt myself.
[13:52.93]Close that.
[13:53.69]Okay.
[13:59.04]There we go.
[14:00.16]Alright.
[14:01.88]Let's get these people added and we'll try to do like a 16 person fight.
[14:06.04]It's going to break.
[14:07.70]Shit ain't even going to work, man.
[14:09.86]Wait, why is my phone doing this?
[14:13.01]Stop!
[14:14.23]I did not set another alarm.
[14:15.67]It was like taking over my phone.
[14:17.57]Is this even working?
[14:23.33]Okay, there we go.
[14:25.85]I'm just gonna tie it.
[14:26.45]I'm not gonna copy and paste.
[14:34.48]Add this person.
[14:37.26]Alright, let's just get a handful.
[14:38.72]Let's get a bunch.
[14:48.01]I need to get at least eight people.
[14:54.23]I think we can, like, group up together.
[14:56.63]Like, somehow.
[14:58.98]As long as we can get at least eight, and then we can queue as eight.
[15:09.14]Then we'll queue into other people that are also going to be eight.
[15:13.34]That should be fine.
[15:17.13]I think I spelled your name wrong, doctor.
[15:19.69]Doctor recommended.
[15:28.50]Okay, there's four, five.
[15:29.92]We need three more.
[15:32.70]Three more!
[15:37.36]Man, alt-tabbing really sucks out of this game.
[15:42.49]Owlboy.
[15:43.15]Let's try to get you in here, dude.
[15:48.06]Now, again, this is just to force our way into 8v8s.
[15:53.06]So, make sure you're in the United States, by the way, when you go to change region.
[15:58.48]Otherwise, you won't be able to queue up into anything we're doing.
[16:02.21]Let's get tenant in here.
[16:11.07]Tenant, and we need one more person.
[16:15.10]Tyler1?
[16:16.02]Isn't Tyler1, like, a huge streamer?
[16:18.49]Did somebody just steal his name?
[16:26.63]Yeah, well, whatever.
[16:27.37]Alright, welcome, Tyler1.
[16:28.47]Uh, let's just get this person out of there.
[16:35.37]Alright.
[16:36.50]So now, I think we can just group up together.
[16:40.16]And just force it into, uh...
[16:44.36]Let's get one more person, I guess.
[16:49.05]Alright, close this window.
[16:51.26]This looks bad.
[16:52.10]Hey, you can't knock it till you try it, man.
[16:59.93]This should be 8.
[17:00.65]Alright, we got 8.
[17:02.65]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and I am 8.
[17:04.41]Group.

[17:48.43]Why does a two gigabyte game take three hours to download?
[17:52.13]That's a good question.
[17:56.07]Who's still not in here?
[17:59.34]Sandman, recommended, cowboy, tenant, Liam.

[21:54.57]I'm trying to go.
[21:58.28]Is it okay if you don't know how to play?

[22:33.58]We are so close.
[22:36.04]Am I still sick?
[22:36.72]Yeah, unfortunately I am.
[22:39.78]In the meantime, let's take a look at my cards.
[22:43.64]I currently don't have any.
[22:47.18]This is kind of bullshit, if I'm to say so myself.
[22:54.15]ResidentSleeper.
[22:56.50]Oh, wow, what a fucking boring shit stream.
[23:01.58]No, you guys, don't worry.
[23:03.34]When the clock strikes 16, shit's going to go down.
[23:12.47]Once this clock strikes 16, you understand this is going to be total nonsense.
[23:19.49]There's weapons in this game.
[23:21.97]You understand?
[23:22.37]There's weapons in this game.
[23:26.06]There's baseball bats, there's bricks.
[23:29.78]I need some music in the background.
[23:33.16]Oh, baby!
[23:34.32]Abandoned station.
[23:35.50]Enter battle.
[23:37.22]We're going into the abandoned underground station.
[23:42.72]Beat all opponents on the other team.
[23:45.03]A shitload of people are leaving the game.
[23:47.73]A ton of people are, like, getting disconnected.
[23:52.27]Look at where we all are.
[23:53.29]That's Team Jerma.
[23:55.52]Look at all my guys in their default blue fucking shirts that they got for installing the game.
[23:59.16]And then we got team, other team.
[24:01.16]They got the same shitty default shirts that we do.
[24:05.58]This is not gonna work.
[24:07.40]This is gonna be a mess.
[24:11.53]Where are the weapons in this level?
[24:12.81]Can you get hit by a train?
[24:15.33]Oh, there's a fucking train you can get hit by.
[24:17.83]We just have to run at each other?
[24:19.07]Alright.
[24:20.83]Sprint!
[24:22.53]I'm going for a dropkick on the first fucking person I see.
[24:29.62]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[24:31.54]Any weapons in here?
[24:32.36]Any weapons in here?
[24:33.60]Alright, that guy's got like a tuba.
[24:35.72]Give me the tuba.
[24:37.70]It disappeared.
[24:38.68]Hold on.
[24:39.96]Fuck this.
[24:42.02]Give me the fuck.
[24:42.54]Give me the... Oh, that's a baseball bat.
[24:43.90]Perfect.
[24:48.94]That guy's on my team.
[24:50.08]That guy's on my team.
[24:57.97]I can't even block.
[24:59.27]This person's punching too fast.
[25:01.53]Help me.
[25:01.93]Somebody help me on my team.
[25:03.25]Help me on my fucking team.
[25:04.45]Alright.
[25:12.16]Watch out.
[25:12.54]Watch out.
[25:13.04]Give me the barrel.
[25:13.68]Give me the barrel.
[25:15.42]Where's the barrel?
[25:16.04]Any more weapons?
[25:16.78]Is this a weapon?
[25:18.36]Yup.
[25:18.94]A big cardboard box.
[25:21.18]Shit.
[25:26.72]What is this, a stereo?
[25:28.19]Who wants to get hit by the fucking stereo?
[25:30.41]That was awful.
[25:36.77]How do you do that?
[25:37.85]You can dodge roll in this game?
[25:41.78]I think these guys are fighting each other.
[25:42.84]Yeah, they are.
[25:47.92]Why am I out of breath?
[25:56.74]Okay, I don't even... Who's even... Who's even still alive?
[26:05.79]There's so many people on the other team that are still alive.
[26:08.21]This one guy is just running around doing the... I wish you could jump into the terrain.
[26:17.84]This guy's so fucked.
[26:19.46]No, what?
[26:21.72]Defeat.
[26:23.62]Oh, they did it.
[26:25.22]Another round.
[26:25.74]Alright, this time go for the weapons.
[26:28.55]Go for the weapons immediately.
[26:31.71]Just bombard them with... Spam them.
[26:33.81]Just make sure they don't get over here.
[26:35.61]Hit them with all the boxes and all the tubes and stuff.
[26:42.52]Who is that?
[26:43.20]Wait, wait, wait.
[26:43.70]Where's...
[26:52.07]I can't... I can't even concentrate on this shit.
[26:56.07]I can't even... I just wanted to see.
[26:58.71]I wanted to see somebody get hit by something.
[27:03.22]This is so fucking dumb.
[27:11.85]Oh my god.
[27:12.57]I can't even block now.
[27:13.85]I'm just like stunned.
[27:20.39]Just fucking rail in his head.
[27:25.83]Block it, block it, block it.
[27:27.47]Counter-attack.
[27:28.73]No, I'm stunned.
[27:31.66]Dude, why are we getting our asses kicked every game?
[27:33.90]Those people just coming with their big cross-body kicks.
[27:49.79]This is fucking stupid.
[27:51.03]Ooh, that was... I think that guy just got parried.
[27:58.10]Yeah, that guy got parried.
[28:01.42]Alright, here's the final contestant.
[28:07.54]Hot bum.
[28:10.13]No, no, Big Flakes is still alive.
[28:17.06]They're all chasing around this one guy.
[28:18.54]Alright, we gotta get his perspective.
[28:20.62]Come on, bakeflakes.
[28:21.47]You can do it.
[28:22.85]You can do it.
[28:23.31]Go find an object.
[28:27.93]The run is so... You're on like a treadmill.
[28:31.05]Oh, he's so dead here.
[28:32.49]You're done.
[28:32.83]Defeat.
[28:43.72]Play acid base?
[28:45.52]I need to get a fucking melee kill.
[28:47.56]Next map we go on, I'll play acid base.
[28:49.56]Don't worry.
[28:50.30]It'll happen.
[28:57.21]I love how there's always like three or four people that just get the barrels and shit.
[29:01.31]God damn it.
[29:01.91]I didn't even see him.
[29:03.75]Get this guy while he's down.
[29:04.61]Get him while he's down.
[29:06.95]Boot this guy.
[29:11.98]I just get hit with a suitcase.
[29:16.06]Throw it!
[29:16.62]Throw it!
[29:17.50]Throw that thing!
[29:19.90]I have to hit space.
[29:20.96]I gotta mash buttons.
[29:24.45]I'm going for a sprint kick.
[29:28.29]Get me out!
[29:30.23]No!
[29:30.69]Wait, what's that?
[29:34.85]E?
[29:35.15]What is that?
[29:35.47]Glass?
[29:36.34]Oh, it's a lead pipe.
[29:37.40]Are you shitting me?
[29:40.22]God damn it.
[29:52.66]Any more lead pipes?
[29:54.74]Any more lead pipes?
[29:56.94]And... Oh, you guys are on my team.
[30:00.28]What's over here?
[30:01.68]Oh, this is a dead guy.
[30:02.50]Never mind.
[30:07.92]My guys' combos are so bad, I do the... I do one kick.
[30:12.94]This isn't a headbutt, though.
[30:15.09]Oh, god.
[30:15.49]Now it's just me.
[30:16.09]I'm dead.
[30:16.51]36 XP.
[30:23.48]I know, down to bake flakes again.
[30:33.40]Why is this other team so much better than us?
[30:39.41]Hey, we're good.
[30:40.01]We leveled up.
[30:41.49]Alright, I gotta go to my combos.
[30:43.23]Let me go to my combos.
[30:44.37]I think I know what the problem is.
[30:46.83]Yeah, I have the same move for the whole fucking combo.
[30:51.39]I need to change that.
[30:57.01]There we go.
[30:58.65]That's better.
[31:03.35]That works.
[31:05.13]Let me spin it back here.
[31:06.11]One, two, three.
[31:08.51]We gotta get rid of the haymakers that are not helping us at all.
[31:11.07]Haymakers are fucking terrible.
[31:20.14]That's good.
[31:20.80]Then go for an uppercut.
[31:22.40]And then another uppercut.
[31:23.80]Bang.
[31:24.24]Got it.
[31:25.66]Special attack.
[31:26.26]I don't think I have anything else besides the headbutt.
[31:28.32]These are my running attacks.
[31:30.66]Alright.
[31:31.06]This time we're just going to go for all.
[31:33.47]Max 8 out of 8.
[31:36.09]So make sure your max is set to 8.
[31:38.01]And just go for all and we're just going to Q. Are we even in the same group still?
[31:44.69]Group.
[31:45.67]Yeah.
[31:45.99]Okay.
[31:46.09]Okay.
[31:47.91]Alright, we're going to queue again for all.
[31:50.05]Make sure you have all selected and you have eight.
[31:51.95]Here we go.
[31:59.58]Acid Bays.
[32:01.12]Thank you, LMK50, for the five months.
[32:05.13]Spass Lasses subscribed.
[32:06.63]Gaudi Godson, thanks for the sub.
[32:08.07]Kun Choi for 10 months.
[32:09.89]Street Jerma Rumble.
[32:12.79]Yeah, I guess you could say that's what this is.
[32:20.80]Uh, thank you, Sam.
[32:21.94]Sam N. For the five dollars, dude.
[32:26.24]Much appreciated.
[32:29.06]I wonder how much content we can milk out of this game.
[32:31.25]What do you guys think?
[32:34.89]Alright, here comes acid base.
[32:46.48]You guys wanted acid base, you're gonna get acid base.
[32:54.30]Oh shit, something's happening.
[32:57.52]I don't know where we're going.
[33:02.32]I was just like in a ring.
[33:04.97]A little skirmish.
[33:16.11]I love the guys that are just cheering in the background.
[33:18.23]Yeah.
[33:23.73]Attack!
[33:28.79]Guys, I paid money to take off my shirt.
[33:31.58]Wait, somebody paid money.
[33:32.80]Somebody paid money to have their clothes changed.
[33:36.30]Let's go for it.
[33:43.09]I don't even know who's on my team.
[33:54.40]Bas just fucking brains it.
[33:55.28]We're gonna win this one.
[33:57.81]Nice, he's on the run.
[34:02.15]Oh shit!
[34:06.87]Shit!
[34:07.11]I'm out of energy!
[34:22.90]Ugh, I almost just got him with a fucking crossbody.
[34:29.15]Why are they all, seriously?
[34:31.29]Everybody on my team is like already dead.
[34:37.43]This is fucking ridiculous.
[34:39.21]They're all still alive.
[34:40.21]Do they have like cheats?
[34:44.37]How could you still have this many people up?
[34:48.08]It doesn't make any fucking sense.
[34:57.91]I'm dead, that's it.
[35:04.30]Has anybody on the other team been knocked out one time?
[35:07.38]Alright, I'm going for... Can I, like, drag these guys into the ring?
[35:19.75]I don't want to let you expend too much of my... I'm going to change this.
[35:26.31]I wish there was weapons here.
[35:28.31]There's one AFK.
[35:29.23]There's one AFK.
[35:29.91]Oh, I was just kicking that guy's ass and his friend comes over.
[35:40.42]Come on.
[35:41.30]Nice.
[35:41.48]I got a friend here too.
[35:42.88]Double team.
[35:53.11]I'm so exhausted.
[35:54.05]Look at my character's portrait.
[36:02.11]Alright.
[36:03.21]Let's be fucking honest here.
[36:05.07]Why?
[36:06.57]Why?
[36:08.25]Why?
[36:10.73]I fucking missed.
[36:12.39]No way.
[36:13.96]No way.
[36:29.58]Why are you getting that shit kicked out of us every single game?
[36:34.50]Alright, stay as one unit.
[36:38.44]Don't run out there.
[36:39.26]Stay here.
[36:39.62]Stay back here.
[36:40.12]Stay here.
[36:41.92]Let them come to us this time.
[36:44.08]And single them out.
[36:44.80]This guy.
[36:45.06]Single him out.
[36:50.52]And fuck this guy too.
[36:58.05]Stay together.
[36:58.41]Stay together.
[37:11.58]Nice!
[37:11.90]It's working!
[37:12.73]It's working!
[37:13.25]Headbutt!
[37:14.81]Headbutt!
[37:15.51]It worked!
[37:18.29]It's just a mess.
[37:20.23]Can anybody tell who is fighting what character?
[37:23.01]I can't.
[37:25.00]Look, we changed up our strategy and it worked.
[37:32.88]Actually... Come on!
[37:33.94]What's up with this?
[37:34.54]I need to catch my breath.
[37:37.21]Alright, we got an equal number of people on both teams.
[37:41.82]That was a good combo.
[37:43.66]Follow it up.
[37:44.08]Look at my guy's face.
[37:47.90]We're gonna win.
[37:52.16]Stay alive, stay alive, stay alive.
[37:55.16]Help me!
[37:55.94]I have no health.
[37:56.72]I'm so dead.
[37:57.24]I just did like a bicycle kick.
[38:05.81]Ooh, take a...
[38:13.13]I just got my face mashed into the ground.
[38:18.35]Come on.
[38:20.05]Did we lose?
[38:24.38]Nope.
[38:24.78]It's back down to one guy again.
[38:26.18]This is no way.
[38:34.20]Alright, well there it is.
[38:40.89]That's the end of that one.
[38:45.83]Alright, this time, let's try a different game mode.
[38:47.69]What about, like, capture the bag?
[38:49.03]Alright, queue up for capture the bag, everybody.
[38:56.42]Oh, man.
[38:59.52]Have I unlocked anything else?
[39:04.94]I can't.
[39:05.24]Alright, queuing up, capture the bag.
[39:07.82]8v8.
[39:08.70]Let's do it.
[39:15.67]See if this is any different than just guys mashing into each other and throwing punches and kicks in the same tiny circle and hitting each other.
[39:26.76]Yeah.
[39:29.44]Play more Peggle 2.
[39:30.24]I actually think I was going to play Fistful of Frags after this.
[39:35.32]I haven't played that in a long time.
[39:38.19]Wait, what?! !
[39:42.82]Can you upload all the movies to YouTube with my permission?
[39:46.34]I mean, I'm probably going to upload all of them to the second channel.
[39:49.68]Like, back to back to back, I would think.
[39:53.08]Is this making me feel better?
[39:54.16]I mean, no, not really.
[40:02.43]Game sucks.
[40:06.19]Thank you, Mick Piruna, for six months.
[40:09.61]We got something here.
[40:10.81]Capture the... Okay, we're in somebody's backyard for this one.
[40:16.73]Capture the bag.
[40:17.90]Backyard.
[40:18.56]Capture the bag and load it into your van in order to score.
[40:21.46]First team to collect six bags wins the battle.
[40:24.96]Bag carrier moves slower and loses the bag when beaten.
[40:29.81]And you respawn.
[40:32.29]Okay.
[40:36.57]This is not a backyard.
[40:37.51]This is like an alleyway.
[40:41.94]Wait, what?
[40:46.40]Is it weird that I lose every time?
[40:49.68]Yeah, it is kind of, it is weird.
[40:52.06]Alright.
[40:53.42]So we need to load shit into the van?
[40:56.86]Don't expend your stamina so quickly!
[40:58.36]Can you get up onto the roof?
[41:00.77]No.
[41:05.53]Alright, well, easy.
[41:07.19]Nice, you got the bag.
[41:15.37]He doesn't even have anything in his hands!
[41:18.53]That was bullshit.
[41:21.05]Alright, I'm gonna go back to the bag carrier.
[41:22.93]That's where the fight is, right?
[41:26.27]Where's the bag?
[41:28.71]It's so dark, I can't even tell who has the bag and who doesn't have the bag.
[41:31.35]What was with the fairy dust?
[41:36.53]Did we get one?
[41:37.06]Everyone's just doing the same stupid kick.
[41:51.94]Come on, help me out here!
[41:52.70]Help me out here with the tire!
[41:53.58]Help me out with the tire!
[41:54.64]Oh, he just missed.
[41:57.78]Right idea.
[41:58.92]What?
[41:59.06]I got a brick.
[41:59.86]I got a brick.
[42:01.00]I got a brick.
[42:03.05]Shit!
[42:07.65]Stop him!
[42:08.01]Stop him!
[42:08.33]Quick!
[42:08.67]Stop him!
[42:09.01]No, it's not a bag.
[42:18.60]It's a tire.
[42:19.92]It's alright.
[42:20.40]I'll get this tire.
[42:24.33]I got him right in the face.
[42:25.75]Right in the fucking face with the tire.
[42:26.93]Perfect shot.
[42:33.61]Headbutt coming in.
[42:34.28]Headbutt.
[42:37.16]Headbutt him.
[42:39.26]No, I ran out of breath.
[42:43.94]Does anybody know what the fuck is happening?
[42:53.15]What is this guy doing?
[42:56.97]Did the bag spawn back here?
[42:58.44]This guy's doing a lot of good blocking, but too bad you can't block a fucking headbutt.
[43:12.06]Someone's outside the map?
[43:14.60]How?
[43:16.56]Watch out for the cardboard box.
[43:17.92]Uh-oh.
[43:27.80]He just missed.
[43:29.70]How many of us are out of the map?
[43:32.86]How do you get outside the map?
[43:36.72]I don't understand.
[43:37.48]Alright, well that guy's outside the map.
[43:45.19]I think we're gonna win.
[43:45.95]How did I miss that?
[43:55.43]Come on, give me a break.
[44:01.27]Everybody's just out of breath in this game.
[44:02.67]Yeah, I guess I get to respawn here in like 10 seconds.
[44:06.54]This guy's just... Fake Flake's just running outside.
[44:16.10]He's like EET.
[44:24.69]What a fucking joke.
[44:34.35]Where did he get the bat?
[44:36.09]I want that thing.
[44:36.81]I want a bat.
[44:39.87]Who wants it, huh?
[44:43.65]I got that guy.
[44:45.74]I'm going for tire only.
[44:49.90]Come on.
[44:50.34]That would've been fucking epic.
[44:51.78]That would've been fucking epic.
[44:56.46]Can we even win the game?
[44:59.97]I really hope somebody just ends up walking up on the ceiling or something.
[45:02.95]That'd be so funny.
[45:06.48]How did they get in there?
[45:08.10]How did you get out there?
[45:11.89]I didn't just write that.
[45:13.07]That's not even me.
[45:17.39]I didn't even write that.
[45:19.95]That's not me.
[45:30.56]I think we're going to win the game.
[45:31.66]Wait till they come around the corner and fucking box him.
[45:35.46]Box that guy.
[45:37.11]Box him!
[45:39.07]Box this guy!
[45:40.99]You had to throw the box!
[45:45.18]Oh, well.
[45:46.56]Alright, well, we win.
[45:47.56]Hey, I got 15 Skullcrushers, dude.
[45:54.27]Alright, the only other thing is Conquest.
[46:06.00]queue up for conquest I guess wait what we'll see what this is and then we're gonna we're gonna play a different game spencer oh the Twitch admins are here they saw me of the mean thing I wrote am I controlling these guys no these are all people these are all players
[46:33.26]Alright, here's what I'm hoping.
[46:34.08]I'm hoping Conquest is like a battlefield map and there's tanks and cars and stuff.
[46:43.14]Can I like seriously do anything else?
[46:46.24]Upgrade.
[46:47.90]I'm gonna upgrade this.
[46:49.98]That's all it does.
[46:50.56]Okay.
[46:54.50]Apparently I'm putting money into this and it's making it just a little stronger.
[46:57.87]That's it.
[47:01.49]Okay.
[47:04.82]Alright.
[47:09.04]Should have reloaded this one.
[47:10.08]Alright, here we go.
[47:13.78]We're going to the container terminal for conquest.
[47:17.57]This actually is a battlefield map, by the way.
[47:20.67]Yeah.
[47:22.17]This is a map in Battlefield.
[47:24.37]Capture bases by spraying over your team's graffiti sign.
[47:28.25]Each captured base speeds up points gathered.
[47:31.76]Okay.
[47:32.86]We have to spray graffiti.
[47:42.80]This is Skate 3.
[47:43.78]It actually does look like Skate 3.
[47:47.96]But I've never played that game though, so I don't know what it is.
[47:53.84]Alright, please tell me that you can throw people off the edge.
[47:58.03]I seriously, dude, I love this guy that just paid probably like five dollars to take the shirt off.
[48:05.57]Can we like fucking get outside there?

[48:14.32]Of course, that guy's gonna... Oh, he is spraying.
[48:19.94]Help me.
[48:20.52]Help me take this guy down.
[48:21.68]Keep the gang spray there.

[48:44.07]Alright, they're all like, they're all, hold on, wait a minute.
[48:48.07]I'm just going to throw it into the fray and see what happens.

[48:54.20]Alright, I got a brick.
[49:00.70]Fuck.

[49:15.76]I'm not even fucking like attacking people with it.
[49:24.27]Give me the barrel, give me the barrel.
[49:30.59]How did I get knocked down?
[49:32.49]Does anybody know how I got knocked down there?
[49:35.58]Wait, I gotta spray the graffiti.

[51:41.83]You just drag it back and forth across their face.
[51:44.27]Alright, I need a melee weapon.
[51:48.43]I wanna go in there with a stick.
[51:49.39]Ooh, what do you think, buddy?

[52:54.58]This person's got a brick.
[53:03.12]These are all real people.
[53:06.38]Alright, this time no fucking around.
[53:08.61]We're going in there.
[53:09.23]I'm not going to throw it.
[53:09.99]I'm just going to use it the way I should have yawned it in the beginning.
[53:12.77]Are you kidding me, buddy?
[53:21.97]You thought you were going to get away with that one?
[53:23.27]Where's the spray?
[53:25.69]Spray it.
[53:26.99]Is this one sprayed?
[53:27.59]Yeah.
[53:33.04]I've ran out of breath.
[53:33.86]Okay.
[53:34.34]Yeah, that makes perfect sense.
[53:47.13]Nice.
[53:47.25]Get him.
[53:48.13]Get him down.
[53:52.89]Nice.
[53:53.17]Perfect.
[53:54.68]We have nothing.
[53:55.90]What the fuck just happened?
[54:01.74]What a fucking mess.
[54:03.44]This is such a mess.
[54:06.39]No, no, no, no!
[54:11.25]He's just like, let it go.
[54:12.73]Alright, this is it.
[54:14.17]This is for the money.
[54:15.51]Give me all the money!
[54:16.29]Oh my fucking god, I got zero dollars there.
[54:20.44]No, it's okay.
[54:21.98]Ooh, nice dodge roll.
[54:22.92]Nice Dark Souls move, dude.
[54:26.60]What the hell was that?
[54:27.22]I just did like a super swing.
[54:35.09]I'm pretty sure we've seen everything there is to see in this game, by the way.
[54:42.69]Got her.
[54:47.95]Nope.
[54:48.21]You want to get the bucket, huh?
[54:50.29]Nope.
[54:51.56]Somebody else get the bucket quick.
[54:58.58]Give it to me.
[54:59.30]Give me it.
[55:10.50]Alright, I'm fucking... I'm fucking out of here.
[55:13.78]I'm done.
[55:14.80]I'm done with this fucking game.
[55:17.08]Alright, let's do one more.
[55:31.13]One more.
[55:31.73]No, no more.
[55:32.45]Eight versus eight.
[55:34.80]How do I take it off?
[55:41.27]Yeah, I'm done.
[55:44.69]We're going to move on to... We're going to play some Fistful of Frags.
[55:48.91]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[55:52.25]Oh, let me see the leaderboards.
[55:56.20]Well, to jump in and dick around for like an hour, that was pretty fun.
[56:00.26]But that was it.
[56:02.66]Is this what it's like to live in Boston?
[56:04.18]Total, wait, time?
[56:05.24]Seven minutes.
[56:06.62]Oh.
[56:08.82]Alright, yeah.
[56:09.94]We're gonna move on to Fistful of Frags.
[56:14.19]Street Warrior Online.
[56:15.75]Alright, I'm gonna change this to Dirty Gunfights.
[56:24.66]Ahem.
[56:27.70]Yeah, this is, uh... I'll be back to normal on, um... On this coming week here.
[56:32.11]I might even stream tomorrow.
[56:33.25]I really just want to get better.
[56:34.35]It's so fucking annoying being sick and... Having, like, a... Tight face at all times and, like, not being able to hear.
[56:41.61]It's really annoying.
[56:44.08]So... Uh, let's move on to Fistful of Frags.
[56:49.16]And... Hold on, give me one second.
[56:51.96]Wait, what?! !
[57:58.95]okay let's move this over here change this to be Fistful of Frags okie dokie
[58:10.55]Alright, let's play Fistful of Frags.
[58:13.38]It's been a while, but this is still a very fun game to play.
[58:18.36]God damn it, I can't see anything, can I?
[58:19.78]Hold on.
[58:24.01]I don't have my borderless window set up for this yet.
[58:26.35]I can't even see the chat.
[58:27.57]What the hell?
[58:31.29]Before we get started, though, this coming week I'm probably going to start Dead Rising 4.
[58:37.25]So either if I feel better tomorrow, we'll start Dead Rising 4.
[58:41.33]If not, then Tuesday we're going to get back to normal and I'll start Dead Rising 4 on Tuesday.
[58:48.58]Yep.
[58:50.24]If you want to play, I mean, I'm on the 18 out of 20 DOD, whatever it's called there.

[61:09.33]How have I not died?
[61:10.81]Oh, no.
[61:11.19]Okay.
[61:11.75]It's not that I died.
[61:12.83]I just didn't.
[61:13.57]Alright.
[61:13.77]Let's get a team here.
[61:14.97]Desperados.
[61:16.69]Oh, let's remember how to play.
[61:17.90]How do I play Fistful of Frags?
[61:20.46]Let's try to remember.
[61:21.52]Is that guy on my team?
[61:22.42]He is.
[61:23.86]Hold on.
[61:24.78]It's alt to slow movement.
[61:26.70]Alright.
[61:29.91]Oh, boy.
[61:30.29]I don't like my controls right now.
[61:35.30]I do not like my control setup.
[61:37.28]I might have to change that.
[61:40.96]Where is this dude?
[61:42.46]You fell to your death.
[61:43.30]Did you have anything on you important?
[61:44.80]I don't think so.
[61:45.26]I need to switch hands on this, by the way.
[61:51.44]Let me change my loadout, too.
[61:56.13]Left-handed with the Colt Navy.
[62:01.13]Let's go with some throwing knives.
[62:02.53]Alright.
[62:08.14]Hold on.
[62:08.42]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[62:09.22]I'm starting to remember.
[62:10.98]It's all becoming normal in my brain again.
[62:13.68]I'm in trouble now.
[62:23.31]I'm going to die in one shot.
[62:24.47]I need the whiskey over there.
[62:30.40]Damn it.
[62:30.64]If you didn't have your friend over there, I would have been fine.
[62:34.56]Left-handed gun makes you, yeah.
[62:36.62]It's weird, but it's more accurate if you have left-handed selected.
[62:40.20]Fan the hammer is better on right-handed.
[62:42.21]One of the things I can remember playing this wonderful game here.
[62:53.19]Shit, he has a... I gotta change my sensitivity, I think, too.
[62:59.92]I need a chest.
[63:05.34]Damn it.
[63:06.54]Not good.
[63:10.00]No whiskey in there either.
[63:12.30]Does it change gameplay if you change your hand dominance?
[63:14.61]Yes.
[63:16.33]If you pick left-handed and they have, like I said, the gun in the left hand.
[63:18.83]Come on.
[63:24.65]Get out of the way!
[63:27.29]Get on the train and escape.
[63:34.31]I just gotta get back in the swing of things.
[63:35.61]I gotta get a streak going!
[63:36.61]I could actually get kills for that, though.
[63:39.03]Alright, here's a chest, but... I don't think I want anything in that chest.
[63:45.64]Just gotta remember the layouts of the map.
[63:49.06]The golden chest is on the train, I think, in this one.
[63:59.64]I don't want this bow.
[64:04.39]Oh wow, what the fuck?
[64:06.55]He had a shotgun.
[64:07.27]What?
[64:07.59]That guy just like fell from the sky.
[64:14.90]What?
[64:16.54]That is such bullshit.
[64:18.10]I got him point blank with a pump-action shotgun.
[64:26.18]Ah, what he bolts is a take to kill a guy.
[64:27.84]Come on.
[64:28.12]I forgot about the kick too.
[64:32.19]You can kick people.
[64:37.92]I helped kill that guy, I think.
[64:43.74]Two shots left.
[64:44.52]I'm going to the clock tower.
[64:53.77]Ah!
[65:05.27]I gotta change that how do I twist my uh keyboard there we go that's what I used to have it on I forgot yeah that's fine there we go no actually I think it was the other one I think it was mouse uh four whatever it's called here
[65:34.07]Past the apple juice.
[65:36.13]Yeah, holding alt for me was always weird.
[65:38.73]Ooh, speaking of weird, we're going to get a yellow, a yellow, a red chest.
[65:44.88]Inside the chest, the red ones, there are good items, stronger than the typical ones.
[65:52.98]I want the peacemaker.
[65:53.78]Alright, let's go on a rampage here.
[66:03.89]Anymore whiskey?
[66:04.81]Yay.
[66:11.71]Don't get too drunk.
[66:12.49]You won't be able to fight.
[66:20.64]It's always so scary playing this game because like anybody could be around any corner and you can just instantly die.
[66:36.70]And this thing takes a long time to reload, too.
[66:48.85]Where the fuck did that guy go?
[66:49.77]Oh, I'm gonna die!
[66:53.59]I'm gonna die.
[66:54.59]I have 13 health.
[67:05.20]Red chest again.
[67:05.88]Look at this guy waiting in this room.
[67:09.32]Oh, he's getting the chest.
[67:12.10]Fuck!
[67:12.51]That was bad.
[67:15.49]Damn it.
[67:15.87]I had 13 health.
[67:16.47]Oh well.
[67:18.81]Use your ult before you die.
[67:24.47]I want to get on the train.
[67:25.39]Here we go.
[67:27.01]There's the golden chest.
[67:28.62]Give it to me.
[67:30.34]Give me the golden chest!
[67:31.38]Come on!
[67:32.10]Open it!
[67:33.14]Open it!
[67:34.19]Open it!
[67:34.55]Get out of here!
[67:35.03]You scumbag!
[67:44.50]Everybody always wants the chest.
[67:56.98]I need to start using the knives more often too.
[67:58.66]I haven't been using them very much.
[68:00.02]Does that help?
[68:06.16]Spawn's like right behind that guy.
[68:14.79]Anybody on the train this time?
[68:15.87]Ah, at least I got that guy.
[68:22.70]Not safe.
[68:25.78]Not safe.
[68:27.25]Not safe, at least I have a guy covering me.
[68:46.20]Come on!
[68:47.60]Come on, stay alive!
[68:49.70]Keep it alive!
[68:56.36]Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[68:57.50]Six health!
[68:58.46]No!
[69:01.93]Ugh, damn it.
[69:05.53]I'm gonna go this way.
[69:07.63]Is it snowing outside?
[69:08.27]It was snowing earlier.
[69:08.97]Alright, let me get, like, the fucking lucky ass.
[69:16.97]Quick-quick-quick-quick-quick-quick!
[69:17.77]Alright, I got the shotgun.
[69:25.54]The shotgun usually means people are in big trouble.
[69:28.75]But for some reason, I didn't instantly kill that one guy.
[69:30.99]I hate going out in the open like this.
[69:43.88]Jesus, don't scare me like that, man.
[69:46.36]I got a super weapon.
[69:52.18]Don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look, don't look.
[69:57.55]That guy right here.
[70:00.47]God damn it!
[70:01.87]See, that's what fucking happens.
[70:04.73]When you got people on every inch of your fucking body attacking you.
[70:07.81]I don't even know what the hell that guy is, by the way.
[70:18.94]There's just people everywhere.
[70:25.99]See, it is a super weapon.
[70:27.07]It's a super weapon.
[70:28.29]As long as you can shoot somebody.
[70:29.57]I can change guns, too.
[70:36.27]The axe is the true super weapon.
[70:40.06]The axe is good, but it's too vulnerable for me.
[70:44.86]Should have got the sniper rifle.
[70:45.82]That was stupid.
[70:48.16]Alright, we're going for a fucking train robber.
[70:51.48]No, we're not.
[70:51.90]We're just dead.
[70:55.53]Let's go with... Alright, we'll do some hatchet gameplay.
[70:59.22]You guys want to see some real hatchet gameplay?
[71:01.56]Fine.
[71:13.45]Welp.
[71:15.95]I think I killed that guy.
[71:17.99]Hatchet time!
[71:18.59]No more fucking around.
[71:36.99]What?
[71:38.02]What the fuck?
[71:39.28]That guy was freaking me out.
[71:40.94]He was like just fucking standing still and shit.
[72:00.31]My liars.
[72:00.89]I'm gonna die right here.
[72:04.83]It's over right here.
[72:05.67]I'm gonna turn the corner and get shot.
[72:15.84]I fucking hit him with it.
[72:26.98]Oh, I hit him right in the face too!
[72:34.10]Give me!
[72:34.66]Give it to me!
[72:35.63]Quick!
[72:36.19]Quick!
[72:37.33]Quick!
[72:47.61]Oh my god, how the fuck am I alive?
[72:52.05]Got him!
[73:01.67]Shop's rifle is fucking awesome.
[73:04.80]Ooh, who am I gonna... Ooh, this guy.
[73:09.26]Got ya!
[73:12.68]Watch out for the... I don't want to get hit by the fucking train.
[73:16.14]That's one thing I don't want to have hit me from behind.
[73:18.90]Shit, that's not good.
[73:20.08]Move out of the way.
[73:21.26]Ah, there it goes.
[73:27.37]Ready?
[73:27.81]Miracle shot.
[73:31.93]Oh my fucking god, that actually almost got somebody.
[73:35.44]That actually could have hit somebody.
[73:38.28]As stupid as that was.
[73:39.12]Alright, thanks for the help.
[73:47.31]Because this is a really good gun.
[73:53.19]Thanks for the help, man!
[74:01.29]Train days.
[74:05.08]Watch out!
[74:05.72]I can't see!
[74:09.44]Fucking good shot from behind too.
[74:11.62]This game needs a dodge roll.
[74:15.85]I fucking love this game.
[74:16.87]This game is really so good.
[74:18.19]There's nothing like just running around.
[74:21.15]It's like a rootin' tootin' cowboy.
[74:23.07]No, it was worth a shot.
[74:26.45]And I'm gonna break all my legs.
[74:28.17]Alright, let's Michael Myers this guy.
[74:47.00]I gotta get in the top four.
[74:47.96]Come on.
[74:50.68]You can't tell who's on what team, so... Everybody's on... It's just one team versus the other team.
[74:56.37]It's not like three or four teams right now.
[74:58.43]Sometimes you can get in games where there's like four teams and it becomes very messy.
[75:06.87]I'm stuck here.
[75:07.99]I'm stuck.
[75:19.65]Mind if I ax you a question?
[75:20.91]What do you want to ask?
[75:26.25]Helped you.
[75:27.65]Got that guy for you.
[75:32.75]Don't get hit by the train.
[75:33.79]Alright, you gotta wait for someone else to jump on the train.
[75:35.90]I'm gonna hide back here.
[75:37.94]Oh boy, I'm poking through the wall.
[75:39.28]Not good.
[75:40.46]Okay, well...
[75:51.63]Get him!
[75:52.43]Get him!
[75:55.81]Get him because I couldn't.
[76:03.51]Get shit-faced.
[76:04.23]Hurry up before somebody comes in the room and then load the rifle.
[76:08.12]What are you doing?
[76:10.32]What are you fucking... Come on.
[76:11.40]What are you thinking?
[76:12.22]That's the stupidest thing you've ever done.
[76:14.02]That's the dumbest thing you've done all day.
[76:23.25]I shouldn't have even... I should have picked it up and then... I just panicked.
[76:31.65]No, nothing here.
[76:41.81]Of course you got a guy behind you.
[76:45.52]Well, I'm not... I'm not gonna get any higher on the scoreboard with the fucking axe apparently.
[76:59.42]I gotta get this guy.
[77:06.46]You will be a fine substitute.
[77:12.56]I'm gonna break... I'm gonna die if I jump from here.
[77:14.56]That's a mistake.
[77:16.30]You get the sharps rifle, you come up here.
[77:18.29]Oh, it's lovely.
[77:19.71]Oh, there it is.
[77:22.03]We're gonna keep him.
[77:27.24]uh 70 accuracy on what weapon was that had the best accuracy in the server apparently uh thank you to cry sick for the sub disco gypsy fish for seven months it's my actual birthday tomorrow well happy birthday dude nila for six months that one guy 831 for three months slayed seven for two months
[77:52.03]Thanks a lot.
[77:52.49]And then die, Beatles, Dr. Taco, Sonicite.
[77:55.01]Thank you for the bits.
[77:56.25]You guys fucking rock.
[78:00.17]Uh, we're gonna move on.
[78:01.09]We're gonna do the bow.
[78:02.91]The bow is really awkward to use, but it can actually do some pretty cool things.
[78:08.74]It's got a huge arc.
[78:10.68]One of the biggest arcs in the... Okay, different teams.
[78:13.24]Different teams.
[78:20.22]Different teams.
[78:20.94]I was fighting my own guys there for a second.
[78:24.06]Where?
[78:24.98]Where?
[78:25.30]70% peggle accuracy.
[78:30.11]That's right, boys and girls.
[78:36.03]This mirror I thought were two people.
[78:37.53]Okay, I'm going to protect you.
[78:38.99]Take it out.
[78:40.36]I'll watch your back.
[78:41.44]Make sure nobody gets you.
[78:43.38]Alright, you're clear.
[78:49.61]I love using the bow.
[78:50.23]The bow is so fun.
[78:52.21]It can be a real pain in the ass though.
[79:00.31]Crash the whiskey!
[79:01.23]What the hell is the other team?
[79:17.26]Gotta go higher than that.
[79:21.83]It's so hard to shoot from that far away.
[79:23.53]Unless you can really line it up.
[79:27.81]Alright, got that guy.
[79:37.48]Shit in my pants!
[79:38.48]There's no way I'm gonna win that.
[79:43.80]I hate being in this room.
[79:45.64]Get us out of this thing.
[79:52.67]What about this way?
[80:00.18]I got him right in the tip of the head.
[80:05.73]Ooh, you, you, you.
[80:06.79]Right here.
[80:07.19]Three, two, one, shoot.
[80:08.75]I think he got killed.
[80:11.31]Yeah, somebody got him.
[80:14.69]What the fuck is that noise?
[80:15.77]You guys hear that?
[80:18.40]That, like, loud, high-pitched ping sound?
[80:21.72]Whoa!
[80:23.57]Huh?
[80:24.83]Oh, he had a sharps rifle.
[80:26.03]Holy fuck.
[80:26.75]Okay.
[80:29.27]Alright, let's see if I can get something out of here.
[80:32.31]Give me... Give me the machete.
[80:36.24]I'm just gonna... I don't even... I'm gonna die immediately and it's not even worth me taking this?
[80:41.32]Let's see if I can get one person with the machete.
[80:44.72]I'll be happy.
[80:48.00]Got him.
[80:48.88]That was me.
[80:54.01]12 fucking health.
[80:58.44]God damn it.
[80:59.14]I'm gonna die if I jump down there.
[81:03.12]Come on, where's the whiskey in here?
[81:04.46]Golden chest.
[81:05.44]Golden.
[81:07.02]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[81:08.30]Take this thing.
[81:09.08]Take it.
[81:09.89]Take that.
[81:11.03]Take it.
[81:12.59]He's not listening.
[81:13.17]It's okay.
[81:13.61]He'll get it.
[81:14.07]I'll block it.
[81:14.49]I'll just make sure he gets it.
[81:21.03]Danger.
[81:21.43]Here comes the danger!
[81:23.73]Hello?
[81:26.50]Hello?
[81:27.72]Hellooooooo?
[81:32.40]Fuck!
[81:40.09]This actually isn't a great level for the bow.
[81:43.01]Too many enclosed spaces.
[81:45.07]This would be great if I use, like, the saw.
[81:46.79]I'm gonna do the shot off here.
[81:48.57]The shot off shotgun.
[81:51.70]Oh, wow, that was fucking pathetic.
[81:53.26]Forgot you had to stand still for, like, just a hair.
[82:07.11]Got him.
[82:08.59]One more hit.
[82:08.98]Come on.
[82:10.68]Well, I tagged that guy.
[82:11.88]Get out of the way, doors.
[82:13.84]You're fucking me up.
[82:21.14]At least I avenged you.
[82:28.70]Thank you.
[82:29.08]Ooh, he's starting a fire up there.
[82:31.26]Actually, you have the... I'll take it.
[82:33.66]Let's use it.
[82:35.92]Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey, whiskey, whiskey.
[82:45.43]I saw a guy.
[82:47.01]He had a scary melee weapon up here.
[82:52.47]Oh, that's such a horrible unnerving sound.
[82:54.69]Where is it even coming from?
[82:59.47]Ah!
[82:59.85]Found the guy!
[83:01.67]Hide behind the curtain.
[83:03.16]Let's pull a Wizard of Oz.
[83:05.24]Come on.
[83:07.38]He is so close for a raise.
[83:08.60]Hold on.
[83:19.06]Shit!
[83:25.44]Third place?
[83:25.88]Come on, I can get in first place.
[83:27.00]This is gonna do good.
[83:37.56]Got him again, too.
[83:39.90]That didn't kill him?
[83:41.08]Hold on, what's 59 plus 59?
[83:42.10]I could've killed that guy.
[83:44.40]I think maybe it was a different guy, I think.
[83:55.62]I'm drunk right now, I can't aim this dumb bow.
[83:57.58]Come on, wear off.
[84:05.02]Whiskey's not even that strong.
[84:06.08]It's really wadded down.
[84:13.85]Come on.
[84:16.29]A whole lot of teammates.
[84:20.73]There's a guy.
[84:32.59]Sniped him.
[84:39.15]There's a guy right there.
[84:39.89]I don't know.
[84:44.33]Is the game free to play?
[84:45.85]This game is 100% free to play.
[84:49.19]It's currently on Steam right now.
[84:50.31]Fistful of Frags.
[84:51.77]Please go download it.
[84:53.03]It is... It is a fucking gem of a game.
[84:55.81]Super fun.
[84:59.12]Super...
[85:01.74]What were you just trying to... What were you just trying to... Somebody's having to kill that guy.
[85:10.07]Oh!
[85:10.45]Oh, come on!
[85:11.75]Come on!
[85:12.69]What the fuck?
[85:14.53]There were so many people behind me, I couldn't even move.
[85:17.85]I was stuffed in, like, the 20-person... Ah, come on.
[85:28.66]Ah, come on!
[85:30.65]Come on!
[85:31.21]I wanna get hit by the train.
[85:39.71]Hey!
[85:44.86]I apparently can't kill you.
[85:47.44]I cannot aim at your head for some reason.
[85:51.44]I'm sorry, that was a gross one.
[85:52.96]That was like a real gross one.
[85:54.24]I want a different weapon.
[85:55.10]Fuck this thing.
[85:58.09]Give me the skull field.
[86:01.28]We're gonna do some fan the hammer kills.
[86:07.25]No, we're not.
[86:07.73]We're gonna die from the machete.
[86:17.88]Somebody just got stabbed over here.
[86:20.34]Hello?
[86:20.72]Who's the guy that got stabbed?
[86:36.55]Ah, get rid of this thing.
[86:37.53]Is this a new weapon?
[86:42.37]This is a new weapon, guys.
[86:47.61]Wait, hold on a second.
[86:50.00]Remington Army.
[86:51.20]This is new.
[86:51.86]I have not seen this.
[86:54.00]Okay.
[86:54.68]Well, I don't have any weapons right now.
[86:55.86]I'll just punch somebody to death.
[87:05.99]Gonna play Happy Stride on the piano, right?
[87:07.93]Does somebody have a gun?
[87:14.73]Watch out for the train.
[87:18.35]What are you doing, man?
[87:28.40]Seriously.
[87:29.90]Like, give me a break.
[87:31.82]Ooh.
[87:34.78]I like this new gun.
[87:37.12]I really like this new gun.
[87:39.44]Awesome.
[87:41.19]It's really slow to reload.
[87:42.37]Super powerful, right?
[87:43.89]Boink.
[87:46.87]It makes boinking real nice.
[87:47.91]Hold on.
[87:48.89]I'm gonna die.
[87:50.11]Gotta get used to this new weapon.
[87:53.21]Look at how long it takes to reload.
[87:58.78]I need disarm fists.
[88:01.78]Yeah.
[88:04.83]I was hoping I could just punch him a bunch of times, but, you know, whatever.
[88:12.11]Shot his hat off.
[88:12.97]God damn it.
[88:14.95]And there goes my stuff.
[88:18.66]A quarter of a pixel down and that guy's dead.
[88:42.52]Did none of those... I'm kind of losing my mind here.
[88:45.70]Did none of those hit?
[88:50.68]I feel like I should have killed that guy.
[88:52.91]Why did none of those hit?
[88:55.67]I feel like I had that lined up perfectly every shot.
[88:57.95]I guess not.
[89:04.73]Come on, fuck.
[89:05.89]Have you ever played Castle Crashers?
[89:08.89]I have.

[90:03.76]I don't want to go to the scary bar.
[90:06.64]No, there's nothing even there.
[90:07.58]No things have spawned.
[90:08.70]No whiskeys spawned.
[90:14.46]I need help with this one guy, please!
[90:17.12]Out of ammo!

[92:16.86]Right in his fucking head.
[92:18.24]I shot him in the head.
[92:21.36]Stupid-ass 6 HP.
[92:22.82]I'm angry now.
[92:23.65]I'm very mad.
[92:26.81]Can you fan the hammer with this gun?

[93:18.28]When you're on, like, a streak... Do I smoke cigarettes?
[93:20.60]I do not smoke cigarettes.
[93:21.68]Absolutely not.
[93:23.94]No, no, no.
[93:25.76]If you think I... My voice... Alright.
[93:30.33]God, fuck.

[93:32.55]God, fuck!
[93:33.95]God, fuck!
[93:43.92]Uh, let's go back to the skull field.
[93:45.14]And we're gonna do some fanning and... What is insatiable?
[93:50.04]Yes, thank you.
[93:50.96]I would love to have that.
[93:53.34]Insatiable and brass knuckles.
[93:56.05]So I can fucking disarm people.
[94:01.39]I'm gonna go right-handed specialist.
[94:04.91]I guess I can only... No, I only have 11.
[94:08.53]Fuck the brass knuckles.
[94:09.96]We're gonna go with insatiable and pick draw.
[94:15.39]Try to fan the hammer here a couple times.
[94:21.31]What I was going to say is I'm fairly sick right now, which is probably why I sound like you think I sound sick right now.
[94:30.56]I assure you I do.
[94:36.92]He's still alive.
[94:38.86]He is still alive.
[94:39.59]Through the window.
[94:43.20]Excuse me!
[94:44.14]Ooh, you have a Henry.
[94:45.14]Or whatever this thing is called.
[94:49.14]Right!
[94:49.58]That sucks.
[94:50.16]That sucks.
[94:50.90]That's real bad.
[94:52.32]Thank God I fucking just luckily killed that guy.
[95:08.63]He needs like one hit.
[95:10.09]Somebody will kill that guy.
[95:11.01]It's not gonna be me.
[95:15.07]I sound like I smoke a pack a day.
[95:17.23]Well, I have like a face cold right now.
[95:21.89]I'm sorry that I sound like this.
[95:27.36]Oh yeah, well I got another gun!
[95:32.64]What?
[95:33.46]That's... That was so inaccurate.
[95:40.16]I had the crosshair right on him and it just didn't fucking shoot him.
[95:44.74]Bull... fucking baloney.
[96:14.83]You need to sneak around.
[96:15.93]I got him too, and his fucking friend came around the corner.
[96:34.78]That was fucking sick, but his friend came in.
[96:41.91]His buddy came around the corner and... What are you doing, man?
[96:46.75]His buddy swooped around the corner and got me in deep trouble.
[96:50.65]Oh, well.
[96:52.75]I saw your mama let you come out and play today.
[97:02.34]Oh, I saw your mama let you come out and play today.
[97:04.64]That would have been a funny stream joke.
[97:22.11]I only have three shots, keep that in mind.
[97:24.93]Jeremy, don't waste them.
[97:26.55]Don't be wasteful.
[97:34.24]Saved.
[97:34.60]Like, how does that guy fucking stay alive?
[97:50.69]I kicked him and shot him twice.
[97:52.75]I did like 80 fucking damage to this guy.
[97:57.35]Like, I don't... Why?
[98:01.19]I did 80 damage and kicked him.
[98:03.13]I got in fucking second dumbass place.
[98:05.19]No, third place, whatever.
[98:21.79]Put it back in the holster.
[98:23.53]Oh, this is a different map.
[98:31.08]Oh, we're going to stick with... I want to go back to left-handed.
[98:35.74]I want to do left-handed Remington.
[98:38.94]I feel like this gun is fun.
[98:41.82]And adequate.
[98:42.99]And sexual, you know what I mean?
[98:44.77]A very sexual weapon.
[98:50.26]Insatiable quick draw.
[98:52.06]Yeah, faster weapon draw.
[98:54.10]Actually, you know what?
[98:56.44]I would probably rather have throwing knives.
[99:02.59]No.
[99:06.13]Get a Derringer.
[99:07.15]Oh, just whatever.
[99:08.20]We'll stick with that.
[99:09.20]There we go.
[99:11.54]I'm okay with that.
[99:12.16]Alright, let's do it.
[99:13.44]Already a red chest up here?
[99:14.44]Are you kidding me?
[99:15.44]Cool.
[99:16.72]I've never played on this map before.
[99:18.02]This is new to me.
[99:18.74]It's like a big house with like train tracks and shit.
[99:21.38]That's cool.
[99:21.92]Alright, let's turn it on.
[99:23.50]Time to turn it on.
[99:25.92]It's on now.
[99:27.44]It's on now.
[99:33.97]It is now on.
[99:35.35]Turn it on.
[99:42.81]Turn it up.
[99:52.76]Oh, acid face.
[100:03.14]You don't know where they could come from.
[100:04.46]They could be anywhere.
[100:12.09]Goddamn.
[100:13.05]I say they could be anywhere.
[100:14.27]A guy appears fucking behind my back.
[100:28.28]Well, I got him.
[100:30.30]I helped.
[100:30.84]I thought that was a guy.
[100:40.99]I thought that was a guy.
[100:42.83]I heard a guy.
[100:48.43]Somebody said yeehaw.
[100:49.49]Wow, you gave it away.
[100:51.56]Don't ever give your position away by saying yeehaw.
[100:54.68]You'll end up getting shot dead.
[101:02.56]Please tell me I have an opportunity to do this and not die.
[101:14.90]This guy just double killed us.
[101:17.56]This guy walked in the fucking way and we got double killed.
[101:20.94]Because I couldn't shoot him.
[101:23.00]And you couldn't shoot him.
[101:23.76]We were like inside each other's bodies.
[101:25.21]This guy just jumped down.
[101:37.75]This is... Can I please get in here?
[101:39.23]Can I... Please?
[101:42.03]Can we... Okay.
[101:51.09]Oh, that would've been cool if I got any shots there.
[101:53.27]Let me just be a total shithead.
[101:55.21]Let's see if I can get this.
[101:56.61]This is gonna be... I'm gonna die.
[101:58.63]I'm gonna get shot one time.
[101:59.65]He's gonna panic shoot me.
[102:00.53]I'm gonna die.
[102:02.59]It's gonna be very easy for this guy to kill me.
[102:25.98]Hey, that was a two-for-one.
[102:27.30]I'll take it.
[102:28.83]I'll take a two-for-one there.
[102:36.67]I'll take it.
[102:37.07]It's okay.
[102:38.13]It's still worth it.
[102:40.93]Yeah.
[102:41.13]Yeah.
[102:42.15]Yeah.
[102:42.33]Yeah.
[102:44.09]Yeah.
[102:56.11]Sitting duck right there.
[102:57.01]Didn't kill him.
[103:02.38]That was close, though.
[103:12.10]One of those long-range rifles would be, you know... Can I please get up there?
[103:22.63]Fucking Tweedledee and Tweedledum on the top there.
[103:28.35]Alright, I gotta go back to getting kills here.
[103:31.13]I'm dicking around too much.
[103:33.25]I'm stuck on the fucking wall.
[103:41.00]That's so irritating.
[103:42.16]Is this gun doing less damage?
[103:44.20]I feel like it is.
[103:45.44]I'm gonna try to use that excuse for why that guy didn't die.
[103:51.20]He had like four health.
[103:59.26]That's fu- Okay.
[104:00.49]This gun, honest to God.
[104:02.83]Three point blank shots to kill somebody with this fucking thing?
[104:06.23]What?
[104:10.27]I don't think I like this thing anymore.
[104:11.65]Well, how far is this being ready to be used?
[104:24.24]I'm going back to this skull field, man.
[104:33.71]What are they saying?
[104:34.35]Cook on my ass?
[104:45.76]There's like three of them.
[104:50.54]Fuck this gun.
[104:54.50]Speaking of like eating ass, that gun can eat my ass.
[105:02.16]Turns out the gun isn't that sexual.
[105:04.63]No, it's not.
[105:08.35]Good shoot.
[105:08.73]Nice kill, buddy.
[105:35.06]Oh, he said cooking, not eating ass.
[105:36.50]Cooking on ass.
[105:37.52]Whatever he said.
[105:38.79]He says a funny line.
[105:39.91]Whatever the funny line is, that's what he says.
[105:46.39]Oh, train.
[105:47.21]Oh, golden!
[105:48.37]I forgot this is a Source Engine game.
[105:51.97]Oh my god, I can't jump over that.
[105:53.43]I have to go through here.
[105:54.53]Holy shit.
[105:57.55]God damn it.
[106:02.96]This is a Source Engine game, means you get stuck on everything.
[106:14.27]Did that guy just jump?
[106:21.92]Like, seriously, go!
[106:23.24]Like, honest to god.
[106:24.42]This is the- like, just walk through the fucking door.
[106:27.26]Why did I get stuck in that door?
[106:31.78]Why?
[106:41.81]Show your face.
[106:43.29]The guy is too far away.
[106:55.50]So close yet so far for that guy every time.
[107:13.73]We're so close.
[107:21.01]Peggle 2 is better.
[107:22.47]No, I love this game.
[107:23.22]It's fucking fantastic.
[107:33.78]Reload.
[107:45.78]Shit, two shots.
[107:46.60]I'm fucking screwed here.
[107:47.48]I gotta let both of them exactly pinpoint the next one.
[107:50.04]Let's go with the Carbine.
[108:05.90]Let's go with Carbine, you know what I mean?
[108:13.36]Always pay attention to your surroundings.
[108:17.58]Like this guy in the window.
[108:18.94]Oh, that's a teammate.
[108:20.64]Always pay attention to your surroundings, guys.
[108:21.98]Knowing your teammate is a teammate.
[108:29.07]I'm not... Just fucking... I take how many times?
[108:39.23]I throw two knives at him.
[108:41.73]And he just fucking punches me once with a melee and I die.
[108:53.00]Just run around with brass knuckles and fucking punch people.
[108:56.12]Apparently.
[109:02.77]Oh, he has no health.
[109:13.44]I wanna get the guy up here on the ridge.
[109:14.94]Come on, show your fi- Get up, get back on the ridge, man.
[109:18.59]Well, that's not gonna kill him.
[109:20.11]Too far away, but... No, that was- that was sloppy.
[109:23.79]Sloppy.
[109:24.55]Corrected.
[109:27.65]Kill that fucking guy who gives a shit.
[109:29.31]Now get the guy on the ridge.
[109:30.25]What, somebody already got the ridge guy?
[109:33.38]Somebody got that guy.
[109:42.12]Hello, Silver.
[109:44.30]What is silver?
[109:44.96]What's going on?
[109:50.59]Fuck, we all suck, apparently.
[109:54.25]Sloppy gamer.
[109:55.27]Yeah, I mean, I am a pretty sloppy gamer.
[110:01.98]This is bad.
[110:12.32]Kill him.
[110:12.94]Kill him.
[110:14.42]Kill him.
[110:15.50]Kill this guy.
[110:16.56]Kill him.
[110:19.08]Okay.
[110:20.54]Okay.
[110:22.46]The guy in the game said... Oh.
[110:24.60]Oh, you guys are saying hello to the guy in the game chat?
[110:31.03]Okay, I was really confused.
[110:34.13]Oh, that wasn't in his head?
[110:35.23]What?
[110:38.57]Oh, give me the red chest.
[110:41.40]Come on.
[110:47.42]Alright, you need to protect me.
[110:49.78]Be a good boy and make sure I don't lose.
[110:51.24]This thing is so, so long to reload, but it's okay.
[111:03.71]Where's the golden gun?
[111:04.47]The thing that kills people in one hit.
[111:06.99]Did they take it out of this game or something?
[111:08.75]Let me just serve it and run it.
[111:15.77]I did a lot of damage over there.
[111:17.67]I'm Silver Jerma.
[111:18.85]Oh, hey, Silver.
[111:19.85]Hey, what's going on, Silver?
[111:25.95]Fucking carnage.

[111:37.18]Okay.
[111:37.38]Sure.

[112:10.08]Oh, you're going to kill us all.
[112:12.34]You kill us all.
[112:14.14]Now he's got the super dynamite.

[124:00.95]I haven't even asked that question.
[124:02.08]I haven't like changed any of my settings in this game in like a year.
[124:12.23]I don't know who to shoot.
[124:33.25]Somebody come over here.
[124:35.44]Get... Get me up there.
[124:38.10]Get... Get up the ladder.
[124:39.96]Get... Oh.
[124:44.40]Oh.
[124:46.19]Oh.
[124:48.59]Oh!
[124:54.84]That was not a hit.
[124:57.28]That wasn't a hit, apparently.
[124:58.86]I shot that guy right in his fucking penis.
[125:01.76]That was a hit, though.
[125:02.70]I don't know.
[125:03.44]Whatever.
[125:05.60]Oh, you did go backwards.
[125:07.64]Stupid and crazy.
[125:08.26]Actually, it's going to be hard to get at this one.
[125:12.47]I say that and I get it.
[125:28.26]Stop that.
[125:28.82]Stop it.
[125:29.22]Stop it.
[125:29.56]Stop it.
[125:29.88]Stop it.
[125:30.16]Stop it.
[125:31.46]Alright, well, let's get there.
[125:33.48]Let's get there at the beginning.
[125:34.57]Let's try it again.
[125:44.55]Did this make a chicken noise?
[125:45.81]Okay, this is the gun that's a one-hit kill, no matter what.
[126:00.97]Let's go this way.
[126:02.39]That was fucking 20 slime right.
[126:13.46]Damn it.
[126:13.78]That was fucking 20 tick right.
[126:26.64]That freaks the fuck out right there.
[126:29.12]Now just kill him.
[126:31.35]Get the sniper rifle.
[126:32.17]You got like a hundred people around you.
[126:33.53]Good luck.
[126:45.52]Come on.
[126:47.84]That's not fair.
[126:52.44]That's not... You know, look.
[126:54.46]I appreciate it.
[127:02.58]It was worth a shot.
[127:11.89]AD.
[127:12.21]What?
[127:34.04]That's... We like to call that where I come from.
[127:37.43]In my neck of the woods, we call that... Dog shit.
[127:45.63]We call that, when we're from my neck of the woods, I'm not sure we know, we call that dog shit.
[127:52.94]That was my kill when you took it from me.
[127:56.60]That was my kill again when you stole it from me again.
[128:18.05]This gun is not what I like to use when I'm having fun in a video game.
[128:22.77]I feel like this thing's hitbox is the size of a fucking pin.
[128:36.83]He's still alive.
[128:39.01]And there goes my kill again.
[128:45.56]There goes my kill, again.
[128:46.72]Hopefully this guy can't hit me.
[128:48.45]No, he's gonna hit me, of course he is.
[128:58.56]You gotta get somebody that's not paying fucking any attention.
[129:03.24]Get him right in the head for 82 damage, great.
[129:11.01]This gun fucking sucks.
[129:14.11]Thank God I got that guy.
[129:23.32]Oh, that would have been so fucking cool.
[129:25.52]How cool would that have been if that guy died?
[129:27.52]Tell me.
[129:28.10]I want everyone to tell me.
[129:31.36]Make me feel better.
[129:41.65]Teamwork and a free-for-all.
[129:53.88]Would have been very interesting.
[129:56.94]Very interesting.
[129:58.80]I was hoping he had a very small amount of health.
[130:04.60]Too bad.
[130:12.64]Please.
[130:14.20]And thank you.
[130:14.92]In the same sentence.
[130:16.94]I feel like someone's just gonna be right... No?
[130:20.24]Like, top maybe?
[130:22.00]No?
[130:22.94]No?
[130:23.54]Uh... Please, game.
[130:38.26]Somebody already won.
[130:39.26]Are you kidding me?
[130:40.89]Holy shit.
[130:47.11]Am I sick?
[130:47.65]I am.
[130:48.51]I am, unfortunately.
[130:50.69]And I apologize.
[130:51.43]Gotta go quick.
[130:58.67]Yeah, we both wanted to go quick.
[131:02.91]I pushed quicker!
[131:17.04]Come on, really?
[131:19.44]Don't turn around.
[131:31.27]Don't turn around.
[131:50.69]I'm in the lead.
[131:55.25]I can't lose it here.
[131:56.05]Oh, you fuck face.
[132:03.38]It's these like long range rifles.
[132:15.91]I freaked the fuck out because I wanted it in my left hand!
[132:18.25]I wanted it in my fucking left hand!
[132:19.95]Every time!
[132:20.51]I have to switch it with Q. Fuck!
[132:33.08]I'm not gonna kill this guy.
[132:51.70]Come on, these are my kills!
[132:53.61]They're mine!
[132:54.79]They're not for you!
[132:55.59]That's such dog shit, really.
[133:23.52]Where?
[133:23.72]I don't even know where he is.
[133:25.64]I have no idea.
[133:28.58]Third place still.
[133:29.50]I can still pull this out of my ass.
[133:34.54]Not with a shot like that, I can't.
[133:37.09]It's fucking medium rifles.
[133:44.43]I couldn't change to do it fast enough to kill that guy.
[133:57.09]Get out of my face.
[133:59.53]Come on.
[133:59.79]Come on, Gwen.
[134:01.49]Come on.
[134:36.99]Oh, fuck me.
[134:37.73]Got it.
[134:39.97]Oh, these guns are so shit.
[134:41.61]I hate the Derringers.
[134:51.72]Like, I... I didn't even shoot the second time!
[135:01.53]Why?
[135:02.71]Why do I have two now?

[136:37.29]And, turn around again, I have the instant quickscope.
[136:40.36]Nice fucking random number generator.
[136:42.22]I'm being last place by the time I kill anybody.
[136:52.60]Honestly, I'm not happy about this right now.
[137:15.55]Long enough probably another guy coming down that hallway No, there's a guy standing there waiting Standing there

[137:51.60]Ah!
[137:56.20]Thought that was a guy.
[138:08.68]Where there's a hat, there's a person.
[138:10.60]Usually.
[138:10.92]Oh, this is such close quarters for this gun, too.

[138:31.95]And play!
[138:47.57]Shit, that scared the hell out of me.
[138:51.77]I want to double barrel this into somebody's face.
[138:54.15]I'm going to launch a bolt and pray.
[138:56.31]Pray that I get a meat shot on someone.
[139:08.61]Meat shot.
[139:09.29]Going for meat shots.
[139:10.11]Going for meat shots.
[139:11.21]Please get out of the way door.
[139:16.07]Oh, shit!
[139:24.62]I wasn't gonna kill him from that far away.
[139:26.82]Not a chance.
[139:27.36]Ah, somebody just used this door.
[139:31.93]Where did they go?
[139:43.19]You remember when we talked about dog shit?
[139:45.35]Yeah.
[139:46.01]I gave that guy like fucking three health apparently.
[140:04.21]Get the smoke out of the way.
[140:21.87]Yeah, there's someone who's gonna shoot him now and do 30 damage.
[140:32.41]Please kill the person in this room so I can get- please.
[140:35.65]Oh, I hate it.
[140:37.49]I hate that he's- but that's okay, don't worry.

[140:40.39]No, this guy!
[140:54.12]Right in his fucking head!
[140:56.80]Right in his fucking head, too.
[140:58.08]That's... I hate when that happens.
[141:01.31]His hat flew off.
[141:02.17]I shot him in the fucking... face.
[141:08.35]Too many people on all sides.
[141:09.45]Just give me a lucky shot and kill somebody, please.
[141:12.81]This guy's fucking... 48.
[141:15.27]48.
[141:15.59]What the...

[141:59.20]Gotta get some more kills.
[142:04.64]That door doesn't open.
[142:08.36]Oops.
[142:10.70]Sometimes you whoopsy-daisy and I just did it.
[142:18.79]No.
[142:19.27]Give me this one.
[142:27.35]That's how you come up to fucking fourth place.
[142:29.91]And then you get tailed.
[142:30.77]You die.
[142:45.35]Did I stream the fighter game yet?
[142:46.47]Yeah, a couple hours ago.
[143:04.33]If I could aim a weapon, that would be fantastic.
[143:09.76]Giving kills.
[143:17.18]Sorry, excuse me.
[143:24.63]I'll do this one more time, then I'm gonna change servers.
[143:29.83]I'm gonna get shot in the back, aren't I?
[143:39.82]No.
[143:43.60]Gotta catch somebody real close with a shotgun for it to be effective.
[143:47.83]Like this guy.
[143:59.26]Damn it.
[143:59.58]It's so hard to string together more than three or four.
[144:17.95]It's too hard.
[144:18.77]It's too hard, Mommy and Daddy.
[144:22.51]I got thread in my mouth.
[144:24.12]What?
[144:24.60]There's something in my mouth, but I don't know what it is.
[144:36.82]I swallowed it.
[144:37.42]It could have been anything.
[144:38.82]I'm in first place.
[144:51.19]You prick.
[144:54.50]You fucking prick.
[144:55.90]You prick.
[144:56.90]You came over and killed the guy that I shot.
[144:59.00]You know, I could complain about that again, but I'm not going to.
[145:03.32]Excuse me, sir.
[145:17.33]14 damage Damn it still the first calm down calm down still the first turn off the slop
[145:44.97]I just... I didn't even get the kill for it.
[145:55.34]I hit like everybody.
[145:56.44]They gave me a break.
[146:02.17]God damn it.
[146:10.43]Ha ha ha ha ha!
[146:18.76]It's alright, I leveled up.
[146:24.10]I got shot from behind with a fucking shotgun.
[146:40.79]That ate.
[146:42.09]That ate it.
[146:49.06]Nope!
[147:27.10]Can't shoot through the fence.
[147:34.29]Like what a disaster.
[147:40.08]This thing is so bad in this situation.
[148:04.98]That didn't kill him.
[148:06.80]Please, no.
[148:08.62]Come on!
[148:09.68]Come on!
[148:14.50]Come on!
[148:16.18]How many fucking times do I have to hit somebody with this fucking thing?
[148:28.35]Finally.
[148:33.73]Don't wanna get that fucking guy.
[148:41.97]These guns are so fucking bad.
[148:47.07]Fuck these little dickhead guns.
[148:59.42]I'd rather drink piss than use these guns.
[149:01.88]I'd rather drink up a fucking vat of piss.
[149:18.41]The crux is always the bow in those.
[149:22.29]The bow and the two shitty little piss guns.
[149:27.61]The salt is strong with this one.
[149:30.11]I fucking hate these things.
[149:38.46]I have to win.
[149:46.64]That wasn't even for real?
[149:47.42]What?
[149:54.34]Magic trick?
[149:54.90]No, I'm done.
[149:56.81]It was a magic trick that I stayed alive.
[149:58.11]No.
[149:58.29]Wow, that was bullshit.
[150:02.57]Gosh darn it.
[150:08.19]Yeah.
[150:25.52]It's hard to get up close when people have the super powerful weapons that kill you in one hit.
[150:30.86]I'm gonna go back this way.
[150:52.20]I don't know where to go at this point.
[151:03.22]Ah, shit.
[151:04.68]Thank God this guy just got in the way.
[151:08.14]No.
[151:08.90]Come on, reload.
[151:10.52]Ooh.
[151:12.08]You're in trouble.
[151:16.39]I thought that guy just came back alive.
[151:19.43]Oh, shit.
[151:19.77]Somebody just gave a bunch of money.
[151:20.79]Hold on.
[151:24.83]Hold on.
[151:25.17]I'm currently in contention.
[151:27.74]Give me a second.
[151:29.78]Just wait until I get to the bow, and then it'll all go to hell.
[151:31.82]Don't worry.
[151:51.85]Damn it, I gave it to that guy.
[151:54.70]And he- did he not get shot one fucking time?
[152:04.52]Yes!
[152:06.20]Yes, that was risky, but it paid off.
[152:20.39]Fuck.
[152:32.65]We're in it to win it.
[152:50.49]Somebody's doing real well too, shit.
[152:59.91]Come on!
[153:30.86]I'm stuck over here.
[153:33.62]I'm stuck in the fucking spawn area.
[153:35.22]Did we spawn together?
[153:36.06]That was dumb.
[153:36.98]Dumb!
[153:48.36]I gotta get somebody by surprise.
[153:49.60]I'm gonna blame that bullshit spawn.
[153:57.61]That's what I'm gonna do.
[154:03.80]Good evening!
[154:11.47]I don't ever use dynamite.
[154:12.79]Ever.
[154:18.32]I don't ever use it.
[154:23.16]Get this guy!
[154:23.62]I'm gonna get him!
[154:25.82]I did it!
[154:28.10]What's next?
[154:29.16]Sawed off?
[154:30.85]What?
[154:31.09]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[154:31.59]What happened?
[154:31.99]What happened?
[154:32.29]What happened?
[154:33.72]What, because I suicided and I went backwards?
[154:35.14]Is that what happened?
[154:37.64]No!
[154:40.30]That's what happened!
[154:41.36]I win the game.
[154:49.22]I won the game.
[154:55.34]That's such a crock of shit.
[154:59.97]Alright, I'm still in first place.
[155:09.50]Guys, not paying any fucking attention.
[155:10.70]Guys, not paying any attention.
[155:12.59]Come on.
[155:14.75]Come on now.
[155:21.27]Come on.
[155:21.68]What?
[155:22.06]Get it.
[155:22.60]No, I didn't fucking get it.
[155:46.30]Well, that's as close as I'm probably gonna come.
[155:52.77]Oh well.
[156:15.22]Oh my god, I'm so tilted from the last match.
[156:18.78]Alright, hold on.
[156:47.81]Give me a second and get back in the game.
[156:54.13]I didn't think I was going to quit out of the whole game.
[157:00.05]That was really fun though.
[157:06.13]I really thought I was going to win that last one.
[157:09.21]If I didn't do the suicide thing, I probably had a chance to really win that game, but whatever.
[157:14.40]I'm going to say I won that game.
[157:17.56]Just because it's going to make me feel better, you know?
[157:21.84]Alright, let's take a look.
[157:22.42]Somebody gave something to me before we get back in the game here.
[157:25.84]Biz Nasty gave 50 bucks, 5,000 bits.
[157:30.29]And they say, pass the whiskey.
[157:32.51]Well, Biz, that's very kind of you, dude.
[157:34.69]Thanks for the $50.
[157:35.51]$50 fucking dollars.
[157:38.25]And Aples just gave five bucks.
[157:40.95]Calm down and drink some whiskey.
[157:42.87]I don't have any whiskey here.
[157:45.97]That doesn't sound like such a bad idea, now that you mention it, though.
[157:49.69]Yerg, thanks for the bits.
[157:50.47]Thank you, Nila, for the bits also.
[157:51.87]Mink, for during that, gave $1,200, $12.
[157:55.39]Jerma does the bang-bang and a boomer shootin'.
[157:59.11]Thanks, Mink, for the $12.
[158:01.97]Generous of you guys.
[158:03.43]50 smackaroonies, yeah, that's... You guys give me money.
[158:07.61]Thank you for the money.
[158:08.83]It's... I never know, like, what to say.
[158:11.41]I always never know what to say.
[158:14.28]Besides, you guys are fucking great people, I guess.
[158:20.38]Great people.
[158:22.26]Let's go back in the game.
[158:23.40]Let's just go to another... I'll play for another maybe half an hour or so.
[158:30.83]All these are high ping.
[158:37.17]Here we go.
[158:38.09]17 out of 20.
[158:39.41]Let's go.
[158:40.05]Let's team play.
[158:40.83]Let's do the four-team shootout.
[158:48.22]What is break bad?
[158:51.66]No.
[158:52.28]I'll go back to the two team again on revenge.
[158:54.58]Yeah, that's a good thing.
[158:58.66]Oh, Jesus, Mink.
[158:59.82]Again, 2200 bits.
[159:02.81]Buy some cold medicine, you dumb.
[159:06.09]I have NyQuil, but I don't want to drink NyQuil at 2.30 in the afternoon because it'll put me out of commission at 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
[159:15.01]But thank you so much for the $22.
[159:18.52]That's too much money.
[159:19.32]Cold medicine's like six bucks.
[159:23.92]Cold medicine's like $7.
[159:25.18]You gave me like 300% more money than you needed to.
[159:28.96]And why am I doing this?
[159:31.08]I think because I have like a lower voice.
[159:32.32]I'm like really getting close to the microphone and talking and being really clever.
[159:36.35]You know, I'm being real clever today.
[159:39.07]Welcome to the stream.
[159:41.15]We have a nasally lower voice today.
[159:44.32]That's right.
[159:45.62]W-K-O-R.
[159:46.98]W-K-O-R.
[159:48.86]92.9.
[159:49.36]The Fizz.
[159:54.28]Alright, let's go.
[159:56.41]Game capture.
[159:57.49]But thank you very much, Mick.
[159:59.39]And Sam, too.
[160:00.13]You guys are fucking giving me money.
[160:02.67]Money, money, money.
[160:04.83]We're a money stream now.
[160:08.83]Why is this not showing up?
[160:10.81]Oh, there we go.
[160:13.90]I'll get to the subs in a minute here, too, but... You guys are all amazing.
[160:17.32]Let's... You know, I talk enough shit about it.
[160:21.21]Let's go for it.
[160:24.97]What is... Derringer?
[160:28.27]I talk enough shit about it.
[160:29.21]We're gonna go for Ambidextrous and... I'm gonna use him.
[160:37.76]Take him out.
[160:38.24]Take the...
[160:40.84]Wait, did they change how that works?
[160:44.74]I think they changed... Usually you had two automatically, I guess.
[160:48.08]That's weird.
[161:03.01]Never mind.
[161:03.35]Yeah, that's... Okay.
[161:06.69]So they made it so you have to select the second one.
[161:11.05]That guy's throwing dynamite down here.
[161:15.87]He's trying to bait it out.
[161:16.73]The little McDonald's guns!
[161:25.62]Little toy McDonald's guns!
[161:27.06]My voice cracked so hard there because I'm sick.
[161:30.38]It's the only reason why.
[161:31.86]I promise.
[161:41.09]What'd you get in your happy meal?
[161:49.19]I feel like if you shot me with this in the face, it would leave like a little Daffy Duck burn mark.
[161:55.51]It wouldn't even hurt me.
[161:58.39]Yeah, you would shoot me in the face with this thing and my duck bill would spin around my head and I'd be, oh my fucking god.
[162:09.01]Hold on a second.
[162:10.19]Somebody just gave $100.
[162:10.91]Somebody just gave $100.
[162:12.03]Who was it?
[162:12.37]Mittens9898.
[162:12.55]$100.
[162:12.57]10,000 bits.
[162:12.75]They said, here's some more for your cold medicine fund.
[162:15.84]Kappa.
[162:32.83]Alright, well, here's the thing, guys.
[162:34.24]If I go to the store and I use this like $200 to buy cold medicine, I'm going to get arrested because they're going to think that I'm using it to like fund my meth lab.
[162:44.31]You guys are going to get me in trouble.
[162:48.64]But no, dude, that's... A fucking hundred dollars is more than I would ever imagine somebody would ever give to me for any reason.
[162:56.38]And a lot of people have given that much money over the course of these last three months.
[163:02.43]I got nothing to say besides it's fucking crazy generous.
[163:09.86]Much love, my friend.
[163:11.10]Mittens, much love.
[163:17.13]You guys are gonna get me all welled up again.
[163:23.79]Gets Jerma in trouble fun.
[163:27.90]Yeah, did you guys see Breaking Bad?
[163:29.16]You guys want Walter fucking Disney to come over and yell at me because I bought too much Sudafed?
[163:38.24]He's gonna come over and he's gonna go, Jesse!
[163:40.82]Jesse!
[163:42.88]This is my town, Jesse!
[163:46.02]I'm gonna go, I just saw my name, and he's gonna go, Jesse!
[163:49.40]We have to cook!
[163:50.60]Jesse!
[163:52.64]Stop calling me Jesse!
[163:53.86]And he's gonna grab me by my fucking shirt and rip me in and be like, Jeremy, Jeremy!
[163:58.83]Listen to me, Jeremy!
[164:04.39]Stay out of my territory!
[164:07.47]Jesse!
[164:10.29]I'm gonna show you a perfect example.
[164:12.92]That's me.
[164:13.34]This guy right in front of me is me.
[164:14.40]Gonna have two derringers.
[164:16.40]This guy's me.
[164:17.18]Jesse!
[164:20.06]And then I die and I'm fucking dead!
[164:23.32]Alright, I'm done.
[164:26.89]I'm fucking done with that.
[164:28.95]Hey!
[164:33.21]Yeah, there is a Twitch staffer in here.
[164:34.67]Hi Twitch staffer!
[164:35.61]He was here for a while.
[164:40.99]Worst joke ever.
[164:41.93]Yeah, I mean, it was pretty fucking tough.
[164:45.29]Alright.
[164:47.43]I'm done with these things.
[164:48.31]I'm taking them off now.
[164:49.25]It was fun for a while.
[164:51.25]We're going for hatchet throw kills.
[164:52.85]What are you doing?
[164:58.91]No, that's not fun.
[165:00.21]What you're doing is not fun.
[165:01.22]What you're doing is not fun.
[165:04.18]That's not fun.
[165:05.40]You're gonna get hurt.
[165:08.22]Alright, throw kills.
[165:09.14]They gotta be at least like a hundred meter distance.
[165:13.16]I gotta get one person.
[165:16.72]A hundred meters.
[165:18.70]Like that guy right up there.
[165:27.78]He's just fucking following me around and blowing himself up with a fucking dynamite.
[165:33.60]I mean, I don't think he kills me, man.
[165:36.16]I think he just... Alright, well, it's over.
[165:43.17]You need to impress the Twitch honchos with your impressive high-brow humor.
[165:49.31]Hey, alright, well, let's impress him.
[165:57.00]So, yeah, Twitch, the guy that's Twitch staff.
[165:59.76]Jesse!
[166:00.62]Remember that one?
[166:05.20]Sorry.
[166:06.86]Spencer, I'm your favorite streamer.
[166:08.38]Are you serious?
[166:09.04]Well, that's fucking cool of you to say.
[166:11.24]Thanks, man.
[166:19.95]I want to get a cross-the-map kill with this thing.
[166:24.37]That's a classic.
[166:25.34]That is a classic.
[166:26.64]I know.
[166:29.46]It's already been opened?
[166:30.18]How has it been opened?
[166:32.82]Shit, I missed.
[166:34.08]Sorry.
[166:35.50]Stop the train.
[166:35.96]Just pull the lever.
[166:37.94]We're all getting stuck back here.
[166:44.41]The train just crashed into the wall.
[166:57.53]I take no responsibility for these throws.
[166:59.53]Somebody just almost hit me in the face, by the way.
[167:03.61]I'm just gonna... No.
[167:06.41]This sucks.
[167:06.95]What am I gonna do without my axe?
[167:09.01]Oh, I found it!
[167:14.63]That would've been cool, but nope.
[167:15.97]He died.
[167:16.85]Hey!
[167:28.62]Hold on.
[167:29.76]Hold on.
[167:32.56]Don't kill me with this.
[167:33.72]I need to kill you with this.
[167:36.02]From across the map.
[167:36.98]Get across the map.
[167:38.50]Keep going.
[167:39.60]We're going for a touchdown.
[167:40.78]Tom Brady!
[167:43.16]I feel like I'm like Yosemite Sam.
[167:52.11]Like, I'm Francis, Francis, Francis, Francis, Francis, Francis, Francis.
[167:57.97]Hold on, hold on.
[168:06.88]Somebody gave money.
[168:07.60]I need to look at it.
[168:08.38]Hold on.
[168:12.45]That one counts.
[168:13.77]I count that one.
[168:14.91]Sorry, guys.
[168:15.47]I did it.
[168:19.17]Shooting me in the back.
[168:26.85]Alright, somebody has to stand across the map.
[168:28.72]If you're in this game, stand, like, really far away so I can hit you.
[168:34.02]But... Let's take a second here.
[168:36.04]Close that.
[168:37.96]Uh, who was it?
[168:38.58]Spencer?
[168:39.24]Spencer, subscribe to the channel!
[168:41.28]Twitch staff.
[168:42.24]Thank you, Spencer.
[168:44.16]Will, sarcasm.
[168:45.08]Will, with another $50, how about that money stream?
[168:49.42]How about it, Will?
[168:50.94]I think that brings you up to, like, $150 this stream.
[168:56.02]That's... You guys are too much.
[168:59.46]You guys are too much.
[169:02.70]I need to, like, make this worth it now.
[169:04.23]I have to kill somebody with this.
[169:05.83]It has to... This... Okay, for a money stream, like, I've got to kill somebody across the map with this.
[169:10.59]Like, this guy right here.
[169:11.47]Three, two, one, action.
[169:15.15]No, not enough action points.
[169:17.47]But I got a little baby gun.
[169:21.15]Oh!
[169:24.12]Darren J for 22 bucks.
[169:26.11]Here's the money.
[169:26.59]Now, please let my family go.
[169:28.03]I don't have your family.
[169:32.49]There's nobody even here.
[169:38.19]Okay, here we go.
[169:39.37]That guy right there.
[169:44.20]I can't even go that far.
[169:48.46]I can't even go that far.
[169:50.88]Here goes my ad bit proper as well.
[169:55.07]I think this guy's gonna let me do it.
[169:56.87]Look at him.
[169:57.21]He's looking at me like, please do it.
[169:58.83]Well, find my wrench.
[170:00.93]Well, my... Whatever it is.
[170:05.31]Tony... Okay, the other team just has to come over here with, like, all axes.
[170:12.88]Just give me axes.
[170:15.12]Hey!
[170:21.06]Well, yeah, Darren, that's... Thank you.
[170:22.68]Will, thank you, man.
[170:25.71]It's a lot of money.
[170:28.77]Well, at least, like... At least you know that, like, you have... Like, if all the guys that are giving, like, money... All the people that are subbed... Oh, hold on.
[170:36.36]Hold on.
[170:39.38]Like, I... Here's what I'm gonna use your money on.
[170:41.52]You ready?
[170:41.78]Because this is... We're gonna be total transparency here, right?
[170:45.44]You just turned on C-SPAN.
[170:46.70]And, like, I'm, like, the president of this channel, you know?
[170:49.59]I'm gonna tell you the transparency...
[170:53.67]I don't... He just tried to do the same thing.
[170:56.83]Fine.
[170:57.33]Fuck it.
[170:58.37]You wanna do that?
[171:03.80]Who killed him?
[171:04.28]How did he die?
[171:04.84]Here we go, here we go.
[171:06.74]This is the one.
[171:08.92]I just need this guy to stand like pretty... Oh my fuck.
[171:15.25]Heh heh.
[171:21.39]You guys don't have to give me this much money.
[171:30.22]You guys... I can't get it.
[171:32.84]Alright, well, let's turn on C-Span.
[171:39.76]After killing, I gotta get this guy, right?
[171:41.56]Three.
[171:41.76]Alright.
[171:43.29]Yeah, there's a guy that's standing still.
[171:44.29]He's standing still.
[171:45.23]He's standing still.
[171:45.85]That guy was standing still.
[171:50.03]Oh, God.
[171:51.69]What do I do?
[171:52.29]I don't know how to react.
[171:54.47]I don't know how to react to these things.
[171:57.69]I'm so bad at... No, he's gonna dive in the train!
[172:04.54]Give me my... Where'd it go?
[172:08.16]I don't know how to ever react to getting this much money.
[172:18.60]You guys are just spoiling the absolute fuck out of me right now.
[172:23.14]He stepped out of the way.
[172:24.01]Alright, hold on.
[172:27.89]Give me a second.
[172:28.61]Let me see what you guys are doing here.
[172:31.05]Sam N for $50.
[172:32.99]How much to buy your love?
[172:34.73]You can't buy my love.
[172:37.25]You can't buy my love, but... That's... I'd rather spend it on Turbo.
[172:42.52]Well... That's... From a guy...
[172:48.14]that just likes to chill and stream, make videos and have fun.
[172:52.54]Like I never understood.
[172:54.28]I guess I like I guess I can sometimes understand why people do things like this, like giving that much money and caring about the stream and shit like that.
[173:05.95]But it's always hard for me to wrap my brain around it because I'm just I'm just a guy that like I didn't even I didn't even get the long range kill.
[173:13.59]I hit him.
[173:17.23]I feel like we have this conversation every, like, month or so.
[173:20.51]But... You guys... You guys don't have to do these things.
[173:25.95]But when it happens and when I see it, I just... I sometimes can't even fucking believe it.
[173:31.66]Like, there's somebody out there that wants to give me $100 multiple fucking times.
[173:40.17]And it racks my brain.
[173:44.35]I sit there like, I wake up in the morning and I look in the mirror and I'm just like, you fucking, you make it worth it today.
[173:52.81]You make it worth it for these people.
[173:54.28]Because they're supporting you every day and they care.
[173:58.70]You have to care too.
[174:01.30]So I hope I do care.
[174:02.32]I hope I can make you guys as happy as I fucking can.
[174:06.06]It's like, I hope I'm doing my job.
[174:11.72]I truly fucking hope I am.
[174:16.81]Because it's... It always blows my mind.
[174:21.77]Be funny.
[174:22.19]You gotta be funny now.
[174:23.03]I gotta be funny.
[174:23.61]Hurry up.
[174:29.72]I hope I do care.
[174:30.68]Well, I mean, when I say I hope I do care, I hope I'm putting forth the effort that you guys deserve.
[174:38.38]Making videos.
[174:38.96]Trying to stream all the fucking time.
[174:40.26]I'm trying.
[174:40.84]And I hope you guys enjoy it.
[174:43.04]That's all I can say.
[174:47.92]Different ideas, like, I wanna do a bunch of shit.
[174:51.04]No, we don't have to do this, like, money stream thing.
[174:58.12]Just give us your routing number, it'll be easier.
[175:05.17]You do your job ten times over, man, we appreciate it.
[175:07.73]Well... I just want you guys to think it's worth it.
[175:15.51]And I'm gonna try my fucking hardest...
[175:18.96]to make sure that, like, your money is not wasted.
[175:22.58]Because it'll go towards things like new huge projects.
[175:25.06]It'll go towards trying to improve the streams and shit.
[175:28.16]I mean, I could be this dead horse for the next two or three hours, but... I'm just gonna keep doing what I'm doing.
[175:39.54]But much love, guys.
[175:40.36]You guys are just... Every once in a while, this happens, and, like, a lot of fucking money comes through.
[175:47.75]But all I can say is, you guys, let me like, put your big fucking heart in the chat, you know what I'm saying?
[175:58.81]Look at this.
[176:01.50]So, I'm going to play a couple more rounds.
[176:03.45]There's people to talk about here.
[176:05.67]I have no money.
[176:06.25]Sorry, Jerma.
[176:06.85]Don't worry.
[176:07.39]You don't have to give any money.
[176:09.97]You don't fucking even think for a second that you have to give a cent to this channel.
[176:14.42]Ever.
[176:15.00]Fucking ever.
[176:15.56]Never think that.
[176:17.26]I want to make that as clear as I possibly fucking can.
[176:20.18]Don't ever fucking assume you have to pay money to this stream.
[176:23.79]Ever.
[176:25.11]You could sit here and never sub, never pay a fucking single dollar to stream.
[176:30.05]You are just... You don't have to... I am not going to be like, oh, well, come on.
[176:37.40]You got to use that sub on me.
[176:39.46]No.
[176:41.90]Never fucking feel that way.
[176:46.10]All that I want you to feel is I want you to fucking feel like you're having fun here.
[176:49.66]That's it.
[176:51.53]That's the only criteria that I fucking have.
[176:55.85]And now check out this kill.
[177:01.66]I'm never gonna get it.
[177:02.60]That was like a... That was a blue moon throw.
[177:04.76]Is this guy on the piano in there?
[177:09.16]Well, I need to go investigate that.
[177:13.14]We have to use our sub 1, you know?
[177:16.24]You peer pressured me into this?
[177:19.82]Oh, he's playing the piano.
[177:23.20]What an easy fucking kill this is!
[177:31.89]That was embarrassing.
[177:34.01]That was really embarrassing.
[177:35.21]I just, boogers just got all over me.
[177:40.09]Hold on.
[177:41.15]They're like all over me.
[177:42.23]One second.
[177:57.20]Okay.
[177:59.10]Um.
[177:59.34]Wait.
[178:00.08]What?
[178:02.17]Let me just say thanks to all the people that are giving the bits right now, like the guys that are giving a lot of them money stream.
[178:12.64]And it's hard to say, like, thanks to everybody.
[178:14.46]Like, I just.
[178:16.90]It's hard to be like, oh, well, this guy gave a fucking thousand bucks.
[178:20.36]It's like Jesus.
[178:20.94]And this guy gave like like ten bucks.
[178:22.99]I want you all to feel like you all belong, you know.
[178:30.36]But it's something that I never expect.
[178:36.12]But... It's... I mean, I'm not going to say I don't want to, like, take your money.
[178:44.83]Because that would be like... Like, oh, no, don't give me any money.
[178:48.13]Do not do this.
[178:51.13]Rake it in, boys and girls.
[178:52.61]Rake it in.
[178:54.30]No, I can't.
[178:55.62]It's hard to explain in words what I mean by this, but hopefully I can sloppily put the sentences together the last few minutes for you guys to know.
[179:05.45]But thank you, everybody that's throwing these subs and these bits and shit.
[179:08.77]You guys are all fucking incredible.
[179:10.41]Let's play some more Fistful of Frags.
[179:16.89]Let's just go into this one.
[179:24.28]Quick, be funny.
[179:27.36]I really made your birthday?
[179:28.29]Well, happy birthday, dude.
[179:31.63]Happy fucking birthday.
[179:35.47]I'm gonna actually try to use this.
[179:40.12]Grandpa possessed me.
[179:41.18]Oh, this is one of the original maps.
[179:44.42]This is one of the originals.
[179:47.00]Fistful of Frag is overrated?
[179:48.30]What?
[179:51.24]I mean, for what it is, I think it's very good.
[179:54.86]Pretty much one guy over the course of the last few years made it.
[179:58.26]This was like three years ago.
[180:00.02]Ow.
[180:04.60]It's your stream today.
[180:06.16]Bits and subs are on its way.
[180:09.69]That is loud.
[180:18.45]They're all congregated up here.
[180:23.97]That guy's got the super kick.
[180:24.93]I need to put the super kick on.
[180:25.93]I have a... I have a good mentality for receiving money.
[180:38.72]Well... Something... I've been around this planet for long enough.
[180:43.40]To... See... I don't know.
[180:48.52]I never was like a fan of...
[180:52.67]Maybe like years ago you guys probably heard me talk about like not taking donations on Twitch.
[180:57.82]Like a year or two ago.
[181:00.47]It's because I never had this, like, what is the value of this stream?
[181:04.49]You know what I mean?
[181:06.33]Like, what is the, how much, like, money is this worth?
[181:09.22]And is it worth, like, fucking 10 bucks?
[181:12.14]Is it worth 100 bucks?
[181:12.62]And I don't know.
[181:13.72]I don't know if I want to, like, open up that floodgate and have people be able to pay me money for what is essentially, okay, it's me, like, streaming.
[181:21.88]People are giving a bunch of money.
[181:23.05]Like, opening up, like, floodgates of money to me was always something I never really was comfortable doing.
[181:30.83]Because money scares me.
[181:32.35]I'm scared of money.
[181:35.09]It scares the shit out of me.
[181:44.08]Did I not have one?
[181:46.16]I guess I can't have one.
[181:55.20]Bits, bits, bits.
[182:01.67]I gotta get some kills here.
[182:13.31]I have to get some shots.
[182:15.89]I gotta do another one of those.
[182:16.77]Remember when I got 16 kills in a row?
[182:18.23]Remember how cool that was?
[182:23.35]Here, here you go.
[182:23.97]Here's the perfect description of what I'm talking about.
[182:26.63]Here you go.
[182:28.21]I don't want this live stream or like YouTube or anything like that to be how can I make as much money as I possibly can in as little time as possible.
[182:39.70]Because contrary to popular belief, a lot of people feel that way in this industry.
[182:47.92]A lot of people want to try to make as much money and want to try to
[182:51.91]get as many people to pay them as possible.
[182:54.91]I don't fucking care.
[182:56.08]I don't, like, want that.
[183:00.86]I'm very vocal about it.
[183:03.80]Nice toss.
[183:07.88]Ah, god damn it.
[183:12.69]Uh, let me go this way.
[183:14.71]This, I actually like the bow here.
[183:15.85]It's time for the bow.
[183:23.70]Having that mindset keeps your content and relationship going.
[183:26.28]I feel like it is important.
[183:34.55]Don't listen to him.
[183:35.11]I'm sponsored by fruit.
[183:36.19]Ah, shit.
[183:37.15]Yeah, he's right.
[183:38.11]You figured it out.
[183:44.47]Where you going with that thing, man?
[183:46.27]You got dangerous waters.
[183:51.58]I thought he was gonna go that way.
[183:53.62]Right in the face!
[183:54.88]I'll take it.
[183:57.08]I will get to those, uh, those large bits donations there.
[184:00.61]Hold on.
[184:04.29]How am I alive?
[184:04.85]That's a good question.
[184:05.65]I don't know.
[184:12.18]I'm looking around for players and all of a sudden... There they are.
[184:19.93]But it's, like, one of the reasons, like, for instance, right?
[184:21.69]I, um, I don't have sponsorship.
[184:23.41]Like, a real one.
[184:24.19]Like, an actual one.
[184:24.95]I don't have any.
[184:26.67]And, uh, I never fucking will.
[184:29.65]Ever.
[184:31.53]If there's one thing I can guarantee you, I can promise you, you will never, never, ever see a piece of sponsored content on this channel.
[184:42.15]Ever.
[184:44.11]And I mean ever.
[184:47.36]That's just a personal thing that I want to stick to.
[184:50.41]I just fucking killed that guy.
[184:52.83]Holy shit.
[184:59.27]You guys, like, are the sponsors at this point.
[185:01.33]You know what I mean?
[185:02.07]Like, you guys are sponsoring the channel.
[185:04.04]I don't need some dickhead to give me fucking money every month because I'm going to say his product.
[185:09.38]You guys are the sponsors.
[185:12.26]I think I just had that realization right now.
[185:13.84]Yeah, I did.
[185:18.46]I would love to hit somebody in the face like that.
[185:25.12]Dork you.
[185:27.58]Ah!
[185:31.05]Forever, ever, forever, ever.
[185:36.23]Yo, goodbye, Coca-Cola.
[185:38.51]Hey, but those are just little jokies.
[185:39.65]You know what I mean?
[185:41.92]Get!
[185:42.86]Get!
[185:43.70]Get!
[185:45.34]You wanna fuck around with that?
[185:47.00]I'm kicking you both over the edge.
[185:48.54]Nope, I'll just kick you both to death.
[185:51.24]That's fine.
[185:55.23]That's right.
[185:57.85]Stream sponsored by the viewers, that's right.
[186:00.99]It'll always be that way.
[186:04.63]Ooh, sneaky!
[186:15.45]Hey, don't scare me like that.
[186:30.67]Oh, free gun.
[186:31.67]Thanks for the free gun, dude.
[186:33.79]Nice.
[186:34.53]See, I just got sponsored a gun.
[186:36.43]Sponsored by Remington.
[186:46.91]Streamer disgraces fruit sponsorship.
[186:50.33]I'm in first place right now.
[186:53.91]I don't know how that's possible.
[186:58.29]I feel like I haven't really been doing much this round, but, you know.
[187:00.82]Shit.
[187:03.74]Yeah, that was...
[187:15.60]Back in my day, you had to sub with multiple accounts to give Jerma money.
[187:21.54]Yeah, I took a long time before I, like, allowed people just to kind of give him money with the whole bits thing.
[187:27.70]Well, the bits thing is, like, kind of cool because, you know, you get the badge, it shows up on the, um, like, in the chat and stuff like that.
[187:39.80]Eventually, like, the whole emote thing that they're adding...
[187:43.91]Maybe eventually we can have, like, custom, like... Maybe, like, the jermaMoon will be, like, a bit emote eventually or something, you know?
[187:56.39]Used to be a Genji stream.
[187:57.43]I think there's a guy right there.
[188:07.90]I love how we're all using the... I love how... I love how... Here it is again.
[188:12.44]The I love how...
[188:20.74]Unavoidable MLG sponsorship.
[188:26.47]Don't do it.
[188:28.99]You won't?
[188:29.31]Alright.
[188:29.67]Okay, fine.
[188:30.23]I'll take you up on that.
[188:31.01]Wait, you have brass knuckles.
[188:35.09]This isn't the old-fashioned way.
[188:36.81]Well, somebody killed you.
[188:40.43]How about we do this the old-fashioned way?
[188:48.37]Fuck, I thought he already shot.
[188:51.07]When is the phase 2 channel revamp?
[188:52.67]I gotta talk to Blore down and we gotta hammer out the details on the new emotes and the new animations and a bunch of other things.
[189:01.64]New subscribe badges.
[189:04.26]There's a lot of new stuff coming.
[189:09.08]A lot of new stuff.
[189:14.90]Second place, that's not cool.
[189:19.22]Right in the hat.
[189:22.38]Shit.
[189:23.02]I thought that was in his head.
[189:27.85]Too many of them.
[189:28.51]Way too many of them.
[189:30.75]Way too many.
[189:34.61]Are the solar system emotes being replaced?
[189:36.44]No.
[189:37.14]They're being added to.
[189:37.94]There's gonna be more solar system emotes.
[189:49.74]Take it off the bow.
[189:50.88]We're gonna go with... Uh... Scofield, left-handed, boots.
[190:01.41]Yeah, I knocked off his vital organ, his hat.
[190:03.69]Alright, let's get some whiskey in us.
[190:15.83]Actually, give me this.
[190:17.15]Close the door.
[190:19.87]Are you dead?
[190:20.49]Are you dead or are you alive?
[190:21.17]Are you dead or are you alive?
[190:22.53]Kill him.
[190:24.13]Kill him.
[190:24.43]Come on.
[190:25.85]Be good.
[190:26.15]Kill him.
[190:27.32]Keep me as soon as... Keep me secure.
[190:29.34]Gotta open it.
[190:31.66]Peacemaker.
[190:33.18]Oh boy.
[190:34.10]Can't even see how much health I have.
[190:38.34]I have like ice coffees in the way.
[190:45.56]It's the one-two punch.
[190:49.82]They spawned back here.
[190:55.97]You are in a real... Okay.
[190:59.43]That guy disintegrated.
[191:01.18]God damn it.
[191:02.14]He was being blocked by the giant pole.
[191:22.07]Uh, if only, if only I could do, uh... If only I could burp like that and then say, yeah.
[191:36.74]That's out of ammo.
[191:44.91]I can't see that fucking glass!
[191:52.35]Hey!
[191:52.97]Hey!
[191:54.65]Hey!
[191:57.03]Not a money stream.
[191:57.71]This is a burp stream.
[191:58.67]Yeah, this is now a burp stream.
[192:03.05]Second place.
[192:03.95]Ah, if I... If I try, I can probably do it.
[192:06.19]Let's try.
[192:06.67]Let's try to get first place.
[192:09.30]Ten minutes remaining.
[192:15.20]Hmm...
[192:24.38]He just tried to throw his gun at me in the fucking head.
[192:26.38]He just barely missed it.
[192:30.10]Just barely.
[192:32.20]What are you doing in there?
[192:41.63]Get that piano off.
[192:44.89]I don't like it.
[192:48.66]I'm actually, I'm glad I got to play this today.
[192:52.89]It's always cool to get back into the world of the frags, you know?
[193:05.92]Shit, watch out for that dynamite.
[193:24.58]Oh, nice shot.
[193:25.68]Thank you for saving all of us back here.
[193:27.50]You're a hero.
[193:39.00]Ah, don't!
[193:41.20]Third down.
[193:44.25]I'm not going to get first place.
[193:47.05]Acid base?
[193:47.53]You want acid base?
[193:49.05]Alright, you get acid base.
[193:51.23]You asked nicely.
[193:52.03]That means you're going to get it.
[193:55.99]I just have it like right here ready to go.
[194:01.04]Bump it up.
[194:01.48]Let's do it.
[194:02.76]10 kill streak with acid base.
[194:20.83]10 kill streak.
[194:21.31]Here we go.
[194:58.77]Oh, baby!
[195:35.09]Oh, well.
[195:39.52]Oh, well.
[195:42.90]There was an opportunity.
[195:44.22]It got close enough.
[195:45.82]It got ruined.
[195:51.89]Sponsored by the movies.
[195:53.09]Yep.
[195:54.33]I'll take a movie sponsorship for sure.
[195:57.41]It's the only one I'll take.
[195:59.05]That and definitely Corsair.
[196:04.55]Or Razor!
[196:10.07]Hey, guess what gear I use, guys?
[196:12.05]Take a guess.
[196:13.53]I use a Razer DeathAdder.
[196:16.37]If you want to have the advantage over other players, you get the Razer DeathAdder.
[196:24.10]Hey, gamers.
[196:26.02]Guess what Jerma985 uses for his games?
[196:28.76]Death Adder.
[196:30.06]Check out these shots only on a Death Adder.
[196:53.79]Hey!
[196:57.23]Hey!
[196:58.11]Huh?
[196:58.57]Hold on.
[196:59.35]Hey!
[197:01.57]Hey!
[197:03.31]Hey, gamers!
[197:04.79]Get one of these good-as-Jerma-and-A-Five!
[197:07.49]Get your so- Hey.
[197:15.22]Yo!
[197:15.98]Enthusiasts!
[197:18.44]Can you hear the sounds of the mechanical keyboard on Jerma985's stream?
[197:22.46]That's a Corsair Mighty XL!
[197:25.38]Check out those frags!
[197:27.22]Can you get that with a regular keyboard?
[197:29.66]No.
[197:30.62]And guess what else?
[197:32.44]You use as a Razer DeathAdder!
[197:36.98]Frag like the best!
[197:39.88]Exclusive!
[197:40.62]Use the code!
[197:44.09]Use the code at the end of this fucking stream!
[197:54.11]Where the hell is anybody?
[197:59.81]Honestly, I have no idea where anybody even potentially is right now.
[198:04.83]I don't even... I mean, there could be like one guy over here.
[198:09.21]I actually kind of like this room because it's... It's got a good view, this room over here.
[198:14.95]And up there is a piano and... Hey, gamers!
[198:19.58]Ever wish you could shoot like Jerma?
[198:22.79]Well, you can.
[198:25.17]As long as you pick up on Black Friday, use code word FATFUCK, and you get 20% off your purchase price.
[198:36.56]By the way, gamers, there's a sale.
[198:44.75]Take a look at this clip from one of Jerma's live streams.
[199:01.90]Fuck.
[199:02.12]Hey gamers!
[199:02.72]I'm done, I'm not done.
[199:04.36]I'm not doing this anymore.
[199:06.90]Have you ever been to a live stream before, gamers?
[199:10.07]And you wanted to see?
[199:16.33]I think I might have had too much cold medicine.
[199:24.45]Hey gamers, can you not shoot a guy that's standing completely fucking still?
[199:29.79]I don't think you can.
[199:31.35]Apparently you can't.
[199:32.33]Make sure you get my fucking keyboard, by the way.
[199:38.53]I'm not gonna catch this guy.
[199:42.92]Jesse!
[199:53.44]Alright, minute and- Dang!
[199:57.13]What happened?
[199:58.39]I shot him in his mouth.
[199:59.85]His mouth turned into a blood spot because I shot him in his fucking face.
[200:07.66]And I didn't get the kill for it.
[200:09.46]Apparently.
[200:13.16]No, I didn't.
[200:14.90]I'm happy with 300 points.
[200:15.92]It's okay.
[200:16.14]Whatever.
[200:24.90]Somebody's spamming on the whiskey right now.
[200:29.13]Make it A. I couldn't eat it so fast.
[200:45.03]60 seconds on the clock.
[200:54.59]Why did I die from?
[200:56.09]Not fair.
[200:58.98]We need acid base to counter.
[201:02.10]Ah, Corsair.
[201:05.62]Come on, die already.
[201:11.26]I only have 23 seconds.
[201:13.21]Hey gamers!
[201:33.26]That was supposed to be all caps.
[201:43.10]I'm done, alright, I'm done.
[201:47.30]I'm done.
[201:49.52]Alright.
[201:57.58]That's going to be it for today.
[201:58.74]I'm going to go relax and take some medicine and chill for a little bit.
