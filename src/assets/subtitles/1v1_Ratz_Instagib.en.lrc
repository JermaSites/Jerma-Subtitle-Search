[ve:60.16.100]

[00:04.32]This is a game about insta-killing, so what you ta- lady- welcome everybody to Rats Insta-gib.
[00:10.40]Here we're gonna show you a couple of quick tips and tutorials and strategies on how to get the most out of your game.
[00:16.47]So as you see here, this is Star here.
[00:18.49]Star, go ahead and give yourself a- let people know who you are and what- how- where they can find you.
[00:22.17]Do you see this like toxic cloud of like red?
[00:26.24]Yeah.
[00:27.59]You die in this?
[00:28.73]I don't know.
[00:30.13]Yeah.
[00:30.45]What?
[00:30.83]Oh, you can't go in this.
[00:31.84]It's like lava, huh?
[00:33.48]That's really... Can't stand still either.
[00:36.82]That doesn't count.
[00:37.46]I'm looking at the lava.
[00:38.56]I have to hit you once.
[00:39.38]Now we're one-on-one.
[00:40.28]No.
[00:40.68]No, look at the frags.
[00:41.96]Look at the frags.
[00:42.40]It's first to 15 frags.
[00:44.07]Oh, okay.
[00:44.71]Fine.
[00:45.51]Seriously, you want to pull that on me?
[00:48.69]You could just kill yourself intentionally.
[00:51.85]Yeah, it doesn't add to somebody.
[00:53.65]Nobody killed you.
[00:54.45]You killed yourself.
[00:58.33]Man.
[00:58.87]I mean, now we're talking about just kind of running away with it, I think.
[01:02.85]I mean.
[01:03.17]That was a stupid spawn.
[01:04.47]I mean, yeah.
[01:05.17]But I'm bad, so.
[01:06.13]I mean, I really think it might be possible to really start running away with this.
[01:13.94]I hit you!
[01:15.40]Did I hit you?
[01:15.92]I don't know, did you?
[01:17.38]You're starting to run away with this.
[01:19.40]You know, you're talking about really starting to run away with something.
[01:23.40]Let's get, let me just, let me 15 to 1 you.
[01:26.69]Okay, let's talk some comedy.
[01:27.93]You want to talk about comedy?
[01:29.50]Whoa, how did you know?
[01:30.22]Wait, you told me we were going to talk comedy!
[01:34.02]I didn't say stop fighting.
[01:35.94]Well, no, you weren't shooting, and you said we're going to talk comedy, and that's when I pay attention to that.
[01:41.68]It's alright, I got a lead here.
[01:44.39]It's the first time.
[01:46.01]I'm going to have... Come on.
[01:49.23]Come on, no...
[01:58.65]My arm just got stuck in the wall.
[02:02.85]It's like... You gotta pay attention!
[02:04.89]You gotta know where people are going!
[02:10.34]How could I?
[02:11.78]Fuck.
[02:12.56]Alright, I can't let this get out of hand here.
[02:14.38]It's like a giant maze and you could be anywhere.
[02:16.40]You could be on the roofs.
[02:18.37]Yeah, but that's how you play.
[02:21.24]Really thought you didn't see me.
[02:23.86]You're bright blue.
[02:26.10]No, listen, I changed the colors and you are the same red as everything.
[02:30.32]Well, why would you do that?
[02:31.78]Because I didn't know we were going to play on the red map.
[02:33.88]I made the enemy red.
[02:34.94]That made sense to me.
[02:35.74]I couldn't even see you through that fog.
[02:38.46]It's called camouflage.
[02:39.34]You're an invisible person.
[02:40.94]Learn how to camouflage.
[02:42.50]Maybe you'll get better.
[02:44.66]Shit, that happens every time I click to respawn.
[02:46.80]And now you know exactly where I fucking am.
[02:48.68]Oh, you can see shadows through the ground.
[02:50.20]Yeah, but you wouldn't have even looked up here.
[02:51.96]I wouldn't.
[02:54.07]And that's what's gonna cause me all kinds of... I'm going to the lava.
[03:02.65]Right in the fucking lava.
[03:05.03]Thank God that doesn't count for anything.
[03:07.05]Yeah, I know.
[03:07.91]What a cheater.
[03:15.65]Yeah, there we go!
[03:17.17]He's doing it!
[03:18.59]No, I did it again!
[03:20.19]The rock is back in Ohio!
[03:22.25]I keep doing that, and I keep telling you exactly where I'm standing!
[03:28.88]Fuck me!
[03:31.10]Okay, good, good, I didn't like- You did it again.
[03:32.82]I didn't- no, I didn't.
[03:34.28]You did.
[03:35.20]No, I didn't.
[03:35.78]I didn't click.
[03:38.88]I can't believe that missed.
[03:40.53]Yeah, someone's cheating.
[03:41.57]Why don't you believe it?
[03:42.83]Got a hacker on the server.
[03:49.47]I'm just gonna, like, focus up here.
[03:51.07]I hit the fucking pole.
[03:57.98]I hit the pole that was right in front of me.
[03:59.76]Are you telling me?
[04:01.71]Telling me I'm... God.
[04:07.73]Oh, you're losing your lead!
[04:12.52]Oh!
[04:14.30]You should have seen that shot from my perspective, because from my perspective, it looked like I hit you.
[04:20.72]Alright.
[04:20.98]Which is something you can't do.
[04:22.30]I am seriously... I am ready to go.
[04:26.18]Yeah!
[04:26.82]Think you're gonna pull that on me?
[04:27.92]You're gonna pull a me on you?
[04:29.16]You're gonna pull me on you?
[04:30.81]Is that what you're gonna tell me?
[04:31.65]You're gonna pull me on you?
[04:33.27]I'm not gonna pull me on you.
[04:37.81]Oh, where is he?
[04:38.81]I don't know.
[04:39.63]I don't know where he is.
[04:42.08]I don't know where he is.
[04:46.00]What the fuck?
[04:46.74]You're sitting in behind the goddamn couch like a fucking prick.
[04:49.57]I killed myself in the lava and respawned somewhere else.
[04:53.07]Wow.
[04:59.51]Oh!
[05:00.41]Now that we've warmed up a little bit... Yeah, I'm... Let's raise the stakes a little bit here.
[05:06.19]Let's go ahead and make another bet.
[05:09.72]Actually, you know what?
[05:10.22]Fuck that.
[05:10.80]I lose every bet, so... You don't want to do that.
[05:13.76]You just tell me what you want me to do, and then that, like, I'll do it.
[05:16.56]I know exactly what you want.
[05:17.78]I want you to do it.
[05:18.30]I've had this written in a notebook for, like, months, just waiting for another bet.
[05:21.92]I want you to wear a silly hat and brush your teeth, but not your teeth, like, your nose.
[05:28.15]Okay.
[05:31.47]Okay, so just... Thanks for... Okay, you did that.
[05:34.49]Is it done?
[05:35.19]Okay, it's done.
[05:36.49]Alright, so let's play, and here we go.
[05:41.47]I'm not spawning.
[05:42.91]Uh, it is a countdown.
[05:44.23]Oh!
[05:44.97]Oh!
[05:45.09]Oh!
[05:45.53]Oh!
[05:45.61]Remember, everybody!
[05:46.27]Oh!
[05:46.39]Oh!
[05:46.79]Remember, everybody!
[05:48.19]It's the first to 15 frags!
[05:51.05]Whoo-hoo-hoo!
[05:52.41]Hey, here we go!
[05:53.58]Ooh, yeah, I'm just gonna be a camper.
[05:55.34]See, the whole part about this game is you want to be bunny-hopping everywhere.
[05:57.48]This is Rats I- This is Rats Insta-gib.
[06:01.74]You really weren't lying.
[06:02.88]You really are.
[06:03.46]You really were being, like, a camper back there.
[06:05.12]I was doing, like, all kinds of, like, Insta-gibs, and you weren't, like, even trying to-
[06:10.70]Where are you?
[06:12.04]Oh, hey.
[06:12.28]I'm all warmed up.
[06:13.46]You're trying to exploit warm-up matches, and this is why I didn't want it.
[06:21.21]Oh, he started setting his controls up.
[06:25.35]Time to make it look like I'm good.
[06:27.13]Good thing you brushed your teeth nose already.
[06:31.35]Don't rule out the underdog just yet.
[06:35.03]I'm going to be like the 1997 Boston Celtics.
[06:39.66]Nobody can be like Gabe the Glue Man Degrossi.
[06:43.56]Oh, where did you spawn?
[06:44.92]Up in the little cabinet?
[06:47.80]I would have killed you, but you had spawn protection.
[06:50.16]I got you anyways.
[06:51.58]What do you mean I didn't get you?
[06:53.74]This is pixel perfect aiming we're talking.
[06:56.44]I spawned in this stupid cabinet.
[06:57.58]The spawns in this are like brutal.
[06:59.20]I'm very scared at all times.
[07:08.31]Those dumb fights where you just get down by the blocks.
[07:10.67]What are those?
[07:12.51]Oh, it's his comeback.
[07:15.18]He thinks he's going to come out and he's going to eat some SpaghettiOs.
[07:20.38]You were behind me?
[07:21.38]Were you outside?
[07:22.00]I didn't even know you could go outside.
[07:23.14]That's not fair.
[07:23.83]You cheated and that's not... He spawns, man.
[07:28.29]I didn't even see you over there.
[07:31.64]Dude, talk about spawns.
[07:33.40]Like, wanna play hide-and-seek right now?
[07:35.32]We're gonna play hide-and-seek, and you're gonna find where I spawned.
[07:37.82]And cut the video, like, 20 minutes ahead, because you're not gonna do it.
[07:42.15]Hold on a second.
[07:43.17]I have to... Where are you, then?
[07:45.75]Hide-and-seek.
[07:46.37]I seriously... I have to come fucking find you?
[07:49.01]Yeah.
[07:50.53]Are you, like, underneath here?
[07:55.14]What?
[07:57.00]You're not, like, in a cabinet or something.
[07:58.52]Ha ha!
[08:03.09]Hold on, maybe, are you like... I just heard you shoot.
[08:06.33]Okay, wait, we're gonna play Marco Polo, okay?
[08:08.11]Yeah, yeah.
[08:09.03]So for me to be able to actually find you, shoot your weapon.
[08:12.11]We'll say Marco, that's the rules.
[08:16.35]Marco!
[08:18.55]Okay, you're over here.
[08:20.07]Marco!
[08:22.57]Alright, even more over here, I think I... You spawned behind the bookcase?
[08:30.28]Oh my god, okay, Marco.
[08:32.26]Again?! !
[08:33.53]Yeah.
[08:36.51]Marco, Marco.
[08:40.29]You're on the fucking light!
[08:42.39]These spot points are brutal!
[08:43.74]You're on the light!
[08:44.84]How would... How would I ever know you were up there?
[08:48.44]I never would've known that.
[08:49.22]You wouldn't!
[08:50.34]If you didn't shoot me, we would've been here until the time limit ran out.
[08:53.56]Alright, just... Shit, if I didn't suck!
[09:02.81]If only.
[09:04.78]See, you didn't think I was going to do that.
[09:06.18]You thought I was going to peek around the edge.
[09:11.10]Yeah, you can just call me Eugene.
[09:12.36]You can call me me... Yeah.
[09:15.58]I thought there's no way I would miss those stupid spawn behind me shots.
[09:20.37]You can just call me Mean Gene Okerlund.
[09:23.03]Fucking, I just told you exactly where I was.
[09:24.95]God, I'm misclicking like an idiot.
[09:31.95]What?
[09:32.15]I saw you.
[09:36.51]Right Yeah, alright, I called on nice shot got some got some frags going on yeah, we do have some frags going on You won the bookcase.
[09:48.38]That's like the third time you spawned in the fucking hide-and-go-seek book What what where are you oh These
[10:06.63]Oh, you have one frag away from winning.
[10:08.32]I can't let you win.
[10:09.04]I don't even know where he is.
[10:12.50]I know where you are.
[10:13.30]No, you don't.
[10:15.18]You fucker.
[10:19.68]No, no.
[10:24.46]Well, it's a good thing you brushed your nose already.
[10:27.50]Shoot the rat, the rat.
[10:32.45]I really thought that was like, for a split second, I thought that was actually happening.
[10:37.61]What's happening?
[10:38.43]I turned around and was like, what the fuck is this thing?
[10:40.19]And you were freaking out.
[10:42.19]I thought the thing was seriously shooting at us.
[10:45.59]And that's how I started shooting at it.
[10:50.38]I thought you were going with the joke.
[10:52.24]But you just were dumb.
[10:56.34]I didn't see you.
[10:58.21]How did you hit that?
[11:03.65]How did you do that?
[11:04.45]Did you spawn on his head?
[11:06.19]Was I on his head?
[11:07.33]I spawned behind you, right behind you.
[11:11.48]I'm kind of scared to move, because there you are.
[11:21.06]I was kind of scared to move there.
[11:22.56]Watch out!
[11:23.81]Kind of scared to move.
[11:24.55]It's a very, uh, spawned, um, uh, damn it.
[11:27.19]Come on, I'm right behind you.
[11:28.49]Come on!
[11:29.21]Come on!
[11:32.15]Whoops.
[11:32.69]I keep doing the Jerma again.
[11:35.27]I wasn't doing it before.
[11:36.25]What changed?
[11:37.77]Yeah, doesn't it like, it sucks because you just immediately give away your position.
[11:41.07]Immediately.
[11:46.38]I luckily hit you right when your spawn protection came.
[11:51.92]These spawns are the worst.
[11:55.58]I just spawned.
[11:56.28]Hey.
[11:56.58]Yeah, you did.
[12:00.12]How are you?
[12:00.80]What are you doing?
[12:02.86]I just, I just, I just, uh, just fun.
[12:05.08]I don't even know where you are.
[12:15.53]Oh, there you are.
[12:17.13]Oh my god!
[12:18.01]You had spawn protection and everything.
[12:20.77]Hey!
[12:21.05]Found you.
[12:21.67]You gotta, you see, you gotta, like, turn and look around at all times.
[12:29.98]You know what I mean?
[12:30.82]I gotta keep my back turned, spin around, back turned.
[12:35.45]Get that spawn protection off of you.
[12:38.29]Nope.
[12:39.99]Only if you get it off of you.
[12:41.75]Got it.
[12:43.39]Got it.
[12:45.09]Shit, I'm fucking... Aye, aye, aye.
[12:53.51]Aye, aye, aye.
[12:55.81]Where's he going?
[12:56.85]Gotta check the usual spawn points.
[12:58.81]I'm gonna find him.
[13:01.89]Found him at the usual spawn point.
[13:02.99]Alright, I'm gonna play.
[13:05.37]Look, I'm gonna play some PC games.
[13:07.41]Damn it, that would've been cool if I hit you.
[13:09.81]Hey, look, guess what I did.
[13:15.50]Spawned?
[13:15.92]Yeah, I spawned.
[13:20.10]That kinda startled me.
[13:25.80]What?
[13:26.60]How do you always know where I'm gonna be?
[13:31.55]How do you always know where I'm gonna be?
[13:34.43]This is tryhard time.
[13:35.37]You have 14 kills.
[13:37.41]Oh yeah, I forgot.
[13:38.23]With stars, like, back is against the wall.
[13:40.75]My back was up against that wall.
[13:44.57]Too hard.
[13:45.65]Dude, do you see this aim percentage right here?
[13:48.07]42%.
[13:48.69]That's pretty good.
[13:49.83]Wow.
[13:52.43]I got a good spawn.
[13:55.98]Well... I think we both have really good spawns.
[14:00.57]Because neither of us are moving.
[14:02.17]No, I guess neither of us... Whoa!
[14:08.80]Dude, at that exact moment, we realized, both of us, and you just were a hair fat... God damn it.
[14:16.86]Why did I think you were going to leave the cubbyhole?
[14:20.06]Why did I think you were going to do that?
[14:25.70]I love how this is what this has turned into, is when we first spawn, who's going to be the one to show their face first.
[14:36.85]I'm looking.
[14:39.27]I shouldn't tell you that I'm looking, but I'm looking.
[14:42.75]Where are you?
[14:45.45]How have we not seen each other yet?
[14:46.57]I don't understand.
[14:47.49]I swear I know where you are.
[14:48.49]No, you jumped right over me.
[14:53.75]Is that where you spawned?
[14:54.45]Mm-hmm.
[14:57.74]What are you doing in there?
[14:58.78]That's where I spawned.
[15:01.11]I keep spawning like behind cabinets.
[15:03.71]Oh, come on.
[15:04.19]You had spawn protection and shit.
[15:06.05]You just like spawn in my line.
[15:07.23]I just spawned exactly where you killed me.
[15:11.21]Seriously, it is so hard to shoot in that little hole.
[15:14.22]Like shooting into there is almost impossible to be able to do.
[15:16.80]Oh, come on with this.
[15:22.22]How is... I'm leaving.
[15:23.74]Yeah, screw that.
[15:28.44]Screw that one.
[15:34.10]Where is he?
[15:34.82]Where is he?
[15:35.40]Where is he?
[15:35.92]Where the hell are you?
[15:40.75]Of course you're up, you're in like the sink.
[15:43.07]Like washing the fucking dirty filth off your hands.
[15:46.81]This, I don't like this level.
[15:49.47]This level is brutal.
[15:53.69]Oh, come on, I was doing some jumps.
[15:55.69]What do you think I was doing?
[15:56.83]When you shot me in the back.
[15:58.67]Like the Benedict Arnold that you are.
[16:00.43]Uh, excuse me.
[16:02.09]Do you want to get instagibed?
[16:04.44]Let me ask you a question.
[16:05.46]This is a serious question.
[16:07.98]Would you like to get... Instagibed!
[16:14.32]Oh, come on!
[16:15.06]You were standing still.
[16:16.73]And I just kept aiming like you were gonna move.
[16:20.31]You're up top on the fucking light again.
[16:21.81]You're always up on a lampshade.
[16:28.46]I was on the lampshade.
[16:29.89]I was looking everywhere.
[16:31.35]I would never look up there.
[16:33.05]Why would you ever look up there?
[16:34.57]I keep thinking the green goo is you sometimes.
[16:38.03]Like the green stuff on the wall, I'm like, oh, that's him.
[16:40.81]But you're blue.
[16:46.79]Shit.
[16:49.50]I did it again.
[16:49.98]I did it again.
[16:51.02]I did it again.
[16:58.00]I'm getting this movement down, though.
[16:59.48]I'm getting there.
[17:01.57]I see you.
[17:02.63]I know where you are.
[17:06.09]No, I don't.
[17:06.55]I lied to, like, give you a false sense of security.
[17:11.12]Damn it.
[17:11.44]It's gonna be so hard.
[17:12.50]It's gonna be so hard to hit you between those, like, books.
[17:14.50]I couldn't get out.
[17:24.42]Jeez.
[17:24.62]Don't cook that one through your face.
[17:26.96]Jeez.
[17:30.58]You're in the rat cage.
[17:31.90]You are stuck in the cage.
[17:36.60]Jumping around is fun, though.
[17:38.48]I will say.
[17:39.12]Alright, okay.
[17:40.56]Okay, string it together here.
[17:42.14]String it together.
[17:43.99]I cannot hit anything right now.
[17:45.99]It's embarrassing and I'm going to... What are you, you're gonna freak out?
[17:50.55]You're gonna, you're gonna... Damn it!
[17:56.61]Why did I not know where you were?
[17:58.47]I knew exactly where you were, and for some reason I was like, yeah, where is he?
[18:01.39]I have no idea.
[18:03.19]Oh my, that's going in the Frag movie right there.
[18:05.70]That was a shot.
[18:06.86]Oh, that's going to go in the Rat movie?
[18:09.44]Yeah.
[18:14.20]I know where you are.
[18:14.74]You think you can be silly and sneaky?
[18:17.35]What?
[18:18.07]You're not going to be sneaky anymore.
[18:21.36]How did you hit me?
[18:22.14]I was behind the wall.
[18:23.72]I turned and I put the crosshair on you and I clicked a left click.
[18:26.24]I wasn't even... There's no way you could have seen me.
[18:33.05]Gotta finish this one.
[18:34.11]Finish this one clean!
[18:38.23]Damn it, I did it again.
[18:39.73]How many times... I wonder how many times I'm gonna say that in this video.
[18:42.85]What is making you do that?
[18:44.51]I'm clicking to, like, respawn and it's screwing me up.
[18:50.23]Okay, seriously, like, I need to clean this up.
[18:57.99]Oh, another frag movie shot.
[18:59.33]Fucking shit.
[19:07.83]Okay.
[19:08.13]You!
[19:08.31]Let's go!
[19:11.36]I tried to turn that corner, there's a chair in the ground.
[19:17.56]Gotcha!
[19:19.05]No, you didn't.
[19:19.65]You didn't even get me for a second.
[19:23.63]Spawn protection enabled.
[19:24.87]That was a shot, Jerma.
[19:28.35]If there's anything you should be proud of, it's that you're leading right now by three points.
[19:32.43]That was a shot.
[19:33.05]If you'd seen what I did right there.
[19:36.17]I'm slowing that one down.
[19:37.09]I want to see exactly how much that went right through your body.
[19:41.23]What the fucking spawner?
[19:42.69]You didn't even know where I was.
[19:43.81]You didn't even know where I was.
[19:48.62]I know where you are now.
[19:49.46]Think you're gonna fool me?
[19:53.59]Think you're gonna fool me with my I'm-on-the-lamp-post bull shit?
[20:01.65]Had the same idea as you and it didn't work out?
[20:03.97]Jesus.
[20:04.61]Why are you kidding?
[20:10.04]You're on the die, you're on the lamp post again!
[20:12.48]This game is both really good and so frustrating.
[20:24.82]I've got a feeling you're gonna spawn, like, on top of me.
[20:26.48]I need to be careful.
[20:29.74]Yeah, you just, like, after you kill someone, you need to freaking hide.
[20:35.93]Hide!
[20:36.53]Hide!
[20:37.13]Hide!
[20:37.39]I know you're gonna spawn.
[20:40.21]I knew you were gonna spawn, because it just happens like that.
[20:42.03]Both of these times I've hit you, just, like... You just end up spawning, like, up on, like, the lamp again.
[20:50.22]Where are you gonna go?
[20:50.68]Where are you gonna go?
[20:51.18]Behind the punching bag?
[20:51.88]Is that where you're gonna- No, on the lamp again!
[20:54.68]On the lamp- How many have you spawned up to, like, five times now?
[21:00.95]That's just scary.
[21:01.47]I could hear you, like- I could hear your keyboard clicking because of that.
[21:05.47]I heard, like- It's fucking spawn protection.
[21:09.67]That was such a nice shot, too.
[21:12.57]Fucking spawn protection.
[21:14.01]Oh, fucking-
[21:19.36]WHAT CAN SPAWN PROTECTION DO?!
[21:22.12]What are you doing there?!
[21:23.05]I was- I didn't think you were gonna look!
[21:26.45]And you're gonna complain about spawn protection, just standing still, like, waiting for my spawn protection to turn off.
[21:33.45]Got you right in the back.
[21:34.99]Got you right in the back.
[21:36.31]Where did you spawn?
[21:36.99]I got you right in the spinal cavity.
[21:41.83]Okay, now you're dead, because I know exactly where you are.
[21:46.68]Now you're dead.
[21:48.57]Let's go ahead and close this one.
[21:49.87]Oh, congratulations.
[21:54.88]My thanks.
[21:55.38]My thanks.
[21:55.86]My thanks.
[21:56.34]My thanks.
