[ve:61.1.100]

[00:00.03]Thank you.
[00:41.34]Hey, what is that?
[00:43.02]How's it going?
[00:43.78]Hello?
[00:47.17]Oh, I didn't change the title.
[00:48.31]That was a placeholder.
[00:51.77]It stays, whatever.
[00:54.04]What is it?
[00:54.36]It's like yoinking my sploink?
[00:57.20]Sploinking around for a few hours.
[00:58.48]I don't even know why I made it this.
[01:05.85]Hey, sometimes the placeholders are better than the actual title.
[01:13.83]Yeah, the original, original title was that.
[01:16.51]And I was like, alright, maybe I shouldn't have it be that.
[01:24.98]But yeah, hello.
[01:27.00]We got a packed day today.
[01:30.27]Maybe.
[01:32.37]Maybe.
[01:34.77]First of all.
[01:36.88]I'm going to play this game called the bleakest keep.
[01:40.12]Looks pretty cool.
[01:42.39]Like a medieval roguelike.
[01:45.53]Third person we have to.
[01:47.72]Climb a castle or something looks pretty fun.
[01:54.47]Then there is water park sim.
[01:58.49]which I've got three stars going for four and then if there's time I think we're I don't know I think the horsemen we're gonna get together a Borderlands 4 came out so I think I it seems like a couple of the horsemen might be wanting to play Borderlands that's like we maybe we'll do something maybe we won't if we do we do
[02:28.26]I think we're talking about a supermarket game where we run a supermarket.
[02:33.85]But I'm here with you.
[02:35.95]And we're going to play the bleakest keep.
[02:42.94]I'm going to wait.
[02:43.46]I want to talk about Doug Doug stream.
[02:46.01]Because a few days ago I mentioned it.
[02:48.55]But it is currently live.
[02:49.41]So we'll maybe wait like 5-10 minutes.
[02:52.50]Get everybody in here.
[02:59.28]But there's a command.
[03:00.08]It'll be in the chat probably every 15, 20 minutes.
[03:04.61]I'll give you a preview if you weren't here a few days ago.
[03:06.65]Doug Doug's doing a charity stream for the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
[03:13.01]And I have an item for auction.
[03:18.46]That item is the Seaman microphone for the Dreamcast.
[03:23.95]The one that I used on stream.
[03:26.08]I signed it, and it's available right now for auction.
[03:33.81]I'm gonna bring this up again later, so just, you'll see.
[03:38.53]He put that in his mouth.
[03:41.50]Yeah, well, if that is gonna make you donate some money to charity and do the auction, then whatever, that's fine.
[03:49.80]Oh my God, dude, I have to get that.
[03:50.80]He put it in his mouth.
[03:52.77]Is that the first thing you're going to say about that?
[03:54.95]That's the first thing that you're going to go to.
[03:58.22]It's not like, oh, interesting item.
[04:00.71]Wait a minute.
[04:01.19]Oh, that's an old classic retro controller.
[04:04.24]And that's a stream that you did.
[04:06.08]He put it in his mouth.
[04:07.40]How much does it cost?
[04:16.40]Did you wash it?
[04:17.20]I've cleaned that thing and washed it before.
[04:19.34]It's not like I didn't.
[04:22.64]I'm very, when it comes to my peripherals, usually my controllers I try to keep pretty clean.
[04:30.19]Because I hate that gamer gunk.
[04:32.03]You know what I'm talking about?
[04:32.81]When you have your controller in your hand and you look down and you can see the ring of just crust.
[04:42.42]I hate that.
[04:44.41]I like to get in there with like a little alcohol wipe or a little just kind of get rid of all of it.
[04:49.98]Clean it up.
[04:51.16]I hate that stuff.
[04:55.20]No, that's gross.
[04:56.08]Look at your controller right now.
[04:58.35]Go pick up your controller that you use and go examine it.
[05:01.29]I guarantee you there is sludge on it.
[05:06.58]I bet you anything.
[05:07.42]If you don't know what I'm talking about, I just I got you.
[05:11.61]My controller is hella clean.
[05:13.33]Well, I'm glad you take care of your peripherals, but I'm just saying, look at your mouse.
[05:18.32]You get that like smear of weird... I don't even know what it is.
[05:23.16]It's like built up wet particles.
[05:25.17]I don't know what it is.
[05:26.01]I'm sorry.
[05:26.37]Are you eating?
[05:26.93]I don't know.
[05:27.33]Why'd you bring this up?
[05:34.50]I only hold my controller with gloves.
[05:40.00]Uh, I mean, if you're trying to preserve the controller, then yeah.
[05:44.60]That's not a bad idea.
[05:48.25]I just imagine somebody with white gloves playing like Dark Souls.
[05:51.93]I don't know why that's funny to me.
[05:54.58]And you're being so gentle, right?
[05:56.92]Because when you play a game like Elden Ring or Dark Souls, you dodge, grab.
[06:00.72]I'm imagining these white gloves just holding the controller.
[06:04.49]And every time they need to dodge, they very gently press B.
[06:08.41]And they're really bad at the game.
[06:09.61]They can't, like, beat the first boss.
[06:16.88]I clean my controllers with a safety pin.
[06:19.52]Yeah, sometimes you just gotta get in there.
[06:26.59]Mickey Mouse playing Dark Souls.
[06:29.81]Oh boy!
[06:33.02]The Tree Sentinel sure is rough!
[06:36.70]Alright, let's go.
[06:37.92]Uh, I'm ready.
[06:38.94]We'll see what the horsemen say later.
[06:41.67]I know that, like I said, Borderlands is currently just came out.
[06:44.75]And it was an... Hey, it was like an alert.
[06:46.30]Borderlands is out.
[06:47.64]Like, oh, okay.
[06:48.82]Maybe we will reschedule.
[06:53.89]Who the fuck is a horseman?
[07:00.66]Guys, I can't start every stream telling you every stream I've ever done.
[07:04.72]Do you know what I mean?
[07:06.18]Like, we can't... We cannot start every broadcast and I sit there and tell you everything I've ever done.
[07:12.01]And every friend I've ever had.
[07:17.40]That's a valid question?
[07:19.46]Okay.
[07:21.34]It's... Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[07:22.76]Were you asking which horseman wanted to play Borderlands?
[07:27.05]Or were you simply asking, what is a horseman?
[07:35.12]Oh, I thought you were saying, what is that?
[07:42.28]When I said that in a mocking tone, I did not mean it that way.
[07:51.84]It was a joke.
[07:52.60]You need to make a Neurostory Electrodump for your entire stream history.
[07:57.42]I would never.
[07:59.02]I wouldn't be able to.
[08:05.73]Okay, let's go.
[08:07.19]This game looks kind of fun.
[08:11.19]The bleakest keep.
[08:12.63]I believe it's like a castle game.
[08:14.36]We have to fight a monster.
[08:18.82]Fight out.
[08:28.25]Okay, here we go.
[08:30.73]Can you see it?
[08:33.28]There it is.
[08:37.00]Alright.
[08:37.42]King Edgar is dead.
[08:38.94]The wizard Cormac betrayed Edgar and the kingdom.
[08:41.89]With the king dead, the land has fallen into chaos.
[08:44.37]Edward, captain of the guards, may be the kingdom's last hope.
[08:47.58]With the help of the sorceress Juliet, Edward may yet save the day.
[08:52.88]It's the top of the keep.
[08:53.73]Defeat Cormac.
[09:01.08]How's the audio?
[09:01.60]Good?
[09:02.32]Louder?
[09:05.67]I think this game is supposed to be pretty quick, but we'll just find out.
[09:08.51]I don't know how to play.
[09:10.63]This is cool already.
[09:13.07]Somebody said neuron activated.
[09:17.62]Alright, let's go.
[09:23.90]I think, is it randomly generated?
[09:25.27]I got a bow.
[09:33.29]I like how it looks.
[09:35.60]I think I gotta turn the sensitivity up.
[09:37.31]Melee strikes have a chance to drop ammo.
[09:39.57]Wooden chests will drop coins and ammo with a chance to also drop an item or ranged weapon.
[09:44.98]Okay.
[09:46.06]Yellow glowing chest will provide a random perk for free.
[09:50.11]Metal chest will drop a random ranged weapon.
[09:52.33]Headshots deal extra damage.
[09:55.05]Okay.
[09:59.04]There's arrows.
[10:00.20]Do I actually have... Oh, there's a... The timer in the bottom left is freaking me out.
[10:03.73]I gotta go fast.
[10:09.96]Can I go fast?
[10:11.14]Can I fight these?
[10:15.29]That feels pretty good.
[10:22.01]Oh, they dodge.
[10:22.45]Alright, hold on.
[10:24.30]There's a new Gorillaz album out?
[10:26.32]What's it called?
[10:28.40]Can I open doors?
[10:34.93]Alright, there's a dodge roll.
[10:36.49]There's a block.
[10:37.13]Ooh, it's a parry.
[10:40.56]This is a speedrun game.
[10:42.16]Ooh, okay.
[10:49.25]It looks like dodging expels the entire stamina bar.
[10:56.58]Alright, you have to hold it for a second.
[11:01.02]Boomerang can hit multiple enemies, headshots, knock enemies back, deals extra damage when returning.
[11:06.63]It's all coming back to you.
[11:11.54]Oh, I have it equipped already.
[11:20.27]Wait, that's a different enemy.
[11:21.03]Hold on.
[11:29.30]Alright, Boomerang's actually pretty great.
[11:34.34]Oh, fuck, that hurt.
[11:35.32]How many heals do I have?
[11:36.86]How do heals work?
[11:39.03]This thing is strong.
[11:40.33]Hold on.
[11:45.14]Okay, I think, is lower left healing?
[11:55.25]Wait, explore everything.
[12:01.62]There's a new game on the Gorillaz website too.
[12:03.98]Really?
[12:05.66]Please react to the new Gorillaz single.
[12:09.08]You want me to react to the song?
[12:15.01]I feel like these guys are better with the... Did I drop the bow and arrow?
[12:19.51]Yes, please react to it now!
[12:20.91]I don't... You want to... Isn't that gonna make the stream shut off?
[12:31.79]Oh, these guys have metal arms.
[12:36.84]Ooh, okay.
[12:37.12]You gotta line them up.
[12:40.63]Oh, shit.
[12:47.78]You need to.
[12:48.52]It's the gorillas.
[12:49.40]I've never done this before, ever.
[12:53.18]I hear you guys tell me about the single like three weeks later and I go, oh.
[13:00.03]How do I heal?
[13:02.55]Is it first time for everything?
[13:03.59]Alright, I'll listen to it, but not right.
[13:05.60]Give me a few minutes.
[13:08.84]Did I miss a chest?
[13:12.34]Oh, shit.
[13:12.82]That was pretty cool.
[13:18.44]Do it now.
[13:19.72]No!
[13:21.04]I'm not gonna!
[13:25.45]Tavern.
[13:29.43]Oh, hello.
[13:30.55]Alright.
[13:31.21]Juliet sells upgrades and items.
[13:32.81]She can also heal.
[13:33.83]Picking up a weapon will also drop a weapon part.
[13:36.94]Select weapon parts for Juliet to craft a different weapon.
[13:41.22]While inside Juliet's shop, you can drop your current range weapon and re-equip your bow.
[13:47.09]Okay.
[13:53.00]so what how much money do I have I got how much money 800 bucks so he said 10 out of 10 game I'm now all in well it's currently on Steam alright range of your sword that's uh that's alright reload speed Dodge regeneration that's good
[14:20.20]Recycling.
[14:20.86]Gain one weapon part when you weapon breaks.
[14:25.95]That's good.
[14:28.35]Fire rate speed?
[14:29.21]I feel like I want that.
[14:34.80]No.
[14:36.84]Should I go melee build?
[14:39.54]Increases my... I want that.
[14:41.92]I see that.
[14:42.43]I click it immediately.
[14:45.07]Picking an enemy will also deal damage.
[14:53.09]Dodge regen?
[14:55.49]Alright, good.
[14:58.18]You health- Oh, shit.
[15:03.02]Heals, 10 HP, repairs 20- Oh, weapons have durability.
[15:08.79]I was run number one, we're fine.
[15:10.19]Okay, so how do I actually heal?
[15:17.82]Uh, use item?
[15:19.04]E. E.
[15:21.34]Change items is mouse wheel and use item is E. Okay.
[15:29.41]That's not a whole... That scared the shit out of me.
[15:33.36]Like I said, that's not a whole lot of healing.
[15:35.82]The boomerang's almost done.
[15:36.92]Should I throw it?
[15:37.58]Did I get rid of it?
[15:39.37]Then we just keep going.
[15:46.48]I'm just gonna keep going.
[15:48.95]Range weapons lose durability the more you use them, and when you take damage, if you take damage while your range weapon's durability is depleted, it will break.
[15:56.36]You can use a wrench to gain 25% of your durability.
[15:59.48]Different range weapons break easier than others.
[16:01.34]Usually, the stronger the range weapon, the easier it will break.
[16:06.97]Did you hear that one?
[16:08.92]Alright, let's go.
[16:12.06]I apparently have to get on top of a castle.
[16:14.72]We're in the courtyard.
[16:21.97]You don't need to defeat every enemy in your path.
[16:27.94]If you're feeling overwhelmed, you may want to ignore enemies and move forward instead.
[16:31.84]However, this also means you will earn less coins to spend on upgrades.
[16:35.85]Remember to block incoming attacks if you are unable to dodge them.
[16:39.09]An attack can only be blocked within a short time, so every block is a parry.
[16:43.78]After blocking, gain a short period of invulnerability.
[16:48.53]Don't forget to use your special attack.
[16:51.16]Oh, shit.
[16:51.95]Okay.
[16:53.01]Alright.
[16:54.63]What does this say?
[16:55.85]These floating coins are all over the place.
[16:57.26]If you see any of these coins, you might want to destroy them.
[16:59.08]There's ten of them hidden in total.
[17:00.94]Who knows where they could be hidden?
[17:05.23]Okay, cool.
[17:06.99]Play the gorilla single.
[17:10.40]If all of you behave for the next 40 minutes, I'll do it on the top of the hour.
[17:19.14]Maybe I shouldn't throw this.
[17:20.56]Can I just kill them with my... Alright, that's actually easier.
[17:31.11]You guys realize all you're going to get out of me from that is me listen to it and go, alright.
[17:36.28]Okay.
[17:38.18]Alright.
[17:39.14]That's it.
[17:40.66]Ooh.
[17:44.01]Accuracy?
[17:46.57]It's content.
[17:49.23]Alright.
[17:51.99]Oops.
[17:53.66]Let's try it.
[17:55.58]Alright.
[17:56.08]You can't just hold block.
[18:04.01]This game is known for its extreme difficulty.
[18:09.41]Alright.
[18:10.17]Okay.
[18:10.79]Hey, how about this?
[18:11.67]I will just react, and you can put it on every... Ooh, wait a minute.
[18:21.19]Like an old-timey musket?
[18:27.28]Like, I'll just react, and then anytime you guys want me to react to something, just use that.
[18:34.83]I still do want to do the thing, and I never will, but you know what I mean.
[18:37.46]It's just one thing that I like to pretend I'll do one day.
[18:40.84]Is react to a movie, but there's no movie, and I like reacting to the Mario movie.
[18:48.80]And for an hour and 40 minutes I'm just reacting to nothing and I'm trying, I can just see how I do it.
[18:53.70]See how well it goes.
[19:00.03]I'm not actually watching the Mario movie, it's like, hey, sync it up with me!
[19:03.39]Watch Mario movie with me!
[19:07.12]And I wonder how much, how well I could sync it up.
[19:15.92]Oh god, my health almost dead.
[19:21.50]Oh my god, he's still alive.
[19:23.91]How do I heal?
[19:26.65]That heal sucks.
[19:31.24]Green screen renaissance?
[19:32.80]Yeah, I thought it would be a green screen video where I'm just sitting there and... I don't know, you put me in a movie theater or something?
[19:41.31]I don't know.
[19:47.62]You are fried, bud.
[19:50.61]Okay, well, Squeaks and I are going to do a fake ghost pepper eating stream.
[19:55.64]I'm pretty sure I was fried a long time ago.
[19:59.95]There's going to be a 30 minute stream at some point soon where I'm pretending to eat a ghost pepper.
[20:07.04]That's it.
[20:08.38]That's all I'm going to do.
[20:16.11]What are your thoughts on the peanut butter M&Ms?
[20:17.87]A little too sweet, but they're okay.
[20:20.66]I'll give you my thoughts on the cookies and cream M&Ms.
[20:23.06]S. I shouldn't have done that.
[20:32.70]Come here, you little shit.
[20:35.12]Oh my.
[20:39.31]Why can I not hit you?
[20:45.61]Say it's a ghost pepper, but eat an apple.
[20:47.07]Well, the thing is, we're both... It's not even a joke.
[20:49.59]It's an experiment in acting.
[20:52.88]Squeaks and I are going to start at the same time.
[20:54.56]And we're both going to eat like a pickle or something.
[20:57.60]And just pretend it's like a... Dude, it's a Carolina Reaper.
[21:01.25]What the fuck?
[21:04.15]And the goal is to make it realistic.
[21:06.17]Who does the most realistic job?
[21:09.12]Who gets the acting points?
[21:12.62]I think it's going to be me.
[21:14.79]I think he's gonna crack.
[21:19.47]What the fuck just happened to me?
[21:23.30]Somebody's screaming at me.
[21:28.39]Oh my god, this game just got so much harder right now.
[21:39.54]Oh no, that's not good.
[21:41.38]That's not good, what do I do?
[21:57.06]Play it slow.
[22:01.56]Jeez.
[22:04.17]No!
[22:04.57]Okay, this game is crazy.
[22:07.95]Alright, I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[22:11.15]Change starting gear.
[22:13.94]Oh, hold on.
[22:21.75]Squeaks in the background?
[22:22.85]Oh, I wasn't even using it.
[22:27.52]Overhead attack.
[22:28.34]Use a powerful overhead strike to deal devastating damage.
[22:32.84]Spin your sword around to deal damage around a spin.
[22:35.31]Or a throwing knife.
[22:38.27]Ah, you don't even start with healing potions if you don't take this.
[22:41.75]They weren't that great anyways.
[22:42.74]Maybe I should just ditch them.
[22:54.05]Feed potions?
[22:54.97]I guess maybe I should just run through.
[22:58.87]Weapons take longer to break, but picking up a weapon won't drop a weapon part.
[23:02.26]I wonder how important that is.
[23:09.11]Maybe this?
[23:10.53]Wrench is great.
[23:12.47]I guess I could, yeah.
[23:15.82]Let me try this.
[23:17.18]And we'll do overhead swing.
[23:26.12]Is your green screen fire coming out of your mouth with the ghost?
[23:28.25]No.
[23:29.55]The whole point is that it's... I'm going to make it realistic.
[23:34.61]I have to make it seem like this is real.
[23:36.80]Oh, wow.
[23:38.50]Creeping up here.
[23:39.28]No, I don't want to give you guys my lines.
[23:42.76]I have to try as hard as I can to make it sound realistic.
[23:50.37]Oh, that's awesome.
[23:51.13]Alright.
[23:57.71]So realistically have fire come out of your mouth.
[24:00.20]That's not going to happen.
[24:08.41]There's a little bit of drop on this.
[24:16.05]Oh shit, I'm out of arrows.
[24:20.29]Is he gone?
[24:21.00]OK.
[24:23.43]Ask chat for your lines.
[24:25.40]Yeah, get halfway through.
[24:26.84]Be like, oh, fuck.
[24:35.27]What's the next line?
[24:36.19]Line, please.
[24:40.20]No, but then I'll lose because I'm a bad actor and Squeaks will do better than me.
[24:50.11]It's funny, me and Squeaks in DMs after that stream were like, hey, I wasn't fucking around, by the way.
[24:55.10]I want to do that.
[24:56.02]He's like, yeah, that sounds great.
[24:57.70]I want to do it too.
[24:59.40]We are both excited about this.
[25:01.55]This is an exciting day for both of us.
[25:13.26]Looks like Halls of Torment.
[25:15.86]I actually, this game's actually really fun.
[25:17.60]I like it.
[25:19.17]I'm vibing with it so far.
[25:26.79]Are you actually going to do it or is it going to be like the Battle Axe room?
[25:30.76]No, it's not going to be like the Battle Axe room.
[25:32.88]Because this is something that I can just do in my living room.
[25:41.07]Alright.
[25:42.29]A boomerang better than musket.
[25:43.45]That musket kind of was stupid.
[25:45.90]Unless I was using it wrong.
[25:49.69]Look at how much better this is.
[25:51.85]That thing's so much better.
[25:59.06]It's alive?
[26:01.58]Give me all of your coins!
[26:07.05]Wait, limb cut a revolver.
[26:08.47]I have to try it, right?
[26:14.86]Kinda like Dead Space?
[26:31.26]I don't want to use these on... Oh my God, I'm going to die.
[26:37.59]These guys are awful.
[26:39.83]You don't have the... I can't lose her.
[26:47.94]Boomerang is literally the worst weapon.
[26:49.78]It was sick.
[26:51.77]What are you talking about?
[27:04.52]The new Bloober game looks like it might be a fun October game.
[27:09.43]We'll do some more scary stuff.
[27:13.11]Getting to be the season.
[27:20.92]Alright, let's go.
[27:21.96]What do you got?
[27:23.67]Does this change every time?
[27:30.07]That's good.
[27:33.58]That's very good.
[27:38.08]That's very good.
[27:39.50]Maybe range.
[27:42.07]I'll do range and special attack speed because that thing is awesome.
[27:46.51]The overhead swing.
[27:52.46]Do I have enough money to buy a potion?
[27:53.58]I keep forgetting to do that.
[27:56.12]It's $300 for one potion.
[28:01.07]That's horseshit.
[28:05.61]I need health.
[28:07.37]It's alright, I'll be alright.
[28:08.41]I'll get health right here.
[28:19.64]Yeah, this says get the coins.
[28:20.66]I already got it here.
[28:24.09]Apparently there's 10 hidden coins.
[28:25.99]Alright, this is where the game actually gets, it turns into the real game.
[28:37.67]I'm waiting for a swing.
[28:46.06]Ugh, I got scared.
[28:47.00]I had to... I got scared.
[28:49.60]No, shit!
[28:53.56]Why have I lost my ability to play the game in one second here?
[29:05.13]Oh, MonkaGiga, Robert Downey Jr.
[29:13.72]Wait.
[29:16.06]Okay, it looks like there's only one linear way to go.
[29:18.86]At least for now.
[29:20.08]Wait.
[29:30.46]How did I miss?
[29:46.45]Okay.
[29:47.65]Those guys are awful.
[30:01.69]Okay.
[30:03.31]Gold chest.
[30:03.87]What do we got?
[30:05.90]And an extra weapon part when your weapon breaks.
[30:08.10]Alright, so I want this thing to break.
[30:15.39]Guys, just got back from listening to the new gorillas.
[30:17.00]It's so good.
[30:18.24]Oh, I can't wait to react to it.
[30:24.09]This thing's actually it's very pixel perfect, but it's good when you hit it.
[30:36.52]Shit.
[30:38.75]Shit.
[30:49.31]I can't mess around.
[30:49.95]I have like one more hit and I'm dead.
[30:57.26]Alright, I got money.
[31:00.16]Maybe I should start with the potions.
[31:04.79]Reacting to the gorillas.
[31:10.56]Alright, who's in here?
[31:12.12]Can I cheese this?
[31:13.36]No.
[31:15.82]I have ten arrows.
[31:16.60]I'm going to use them.
[31:24.38]Okay, this thing, the drop is kind of fun to use.
[31:37.31]Reload speed, alright.
[31:42.09]Alright, this is the area where I keep getting screwed over.
[31:51.42]Okay, it's ranged all day.
[31:53.58]It just is.
[31:55.66]Until maybe I get a better melee weapon or increasing strength.
[31:58.99]I shouldn't have picked strength in the beginning.
[32:01.37]Well, okay, well now I have to use it.
[32:08.34]Okay, here we go.
[32:10.29]Oh!
[32:12.61]Oh my god, this room sucks!
[32:17.96]No!
[32:22.47]Oh, fuck!
[32:27.09]Yes!
[32:29.59]Alright, I gotta make it out of here.
[32:30.47]That was the first real challenge.
[32:34.63]Oh, fuck.
[32:36.45]Alright, don't get killed by the one random skeleton, please.
[32:39.92]Alright.
[32:41.54]Hell yeah.
[32:42.24]That was actually pretty rough.
[32:48.44]Wait, he's gaming right now.
[32:49.71]I am.
[32:51.49]Wait, I can go this way.
[32:52.69]Is this a shortcut?
[32:55.17]Shortcut?
[32:57.88]Shortcut over the rapids.
[32:59.22]Lower this bridge in case of an emergency.
[33:01.29]Oh, yeah.
[33:06.37]Look at that.
[33:08.09]I don't know where that goes.
[33:09.80]Did I find out?
[33:12.68]Did I love the Hearthstone Battlegrounds stream?
[33:16.18]You like to just make shit up.
[33:20.71]If you got a notification that I was playing Hearthstone Battlegrounds, you wouldn't even click the notification on your phone.
[33:29.98]You'd go, nope.
[33:32.66]Rowing axe.
[33:33.48]Deals very heavy damage to headshots.
[33:35.19]Less accurate.
[33:38.15]Uh, yeah.
[33:38.81]Let's try it.
[33:39.97]How many do I have?
[33:40.73]Just one?
[33:43.34]How does it work?
[33:44.98]It says I have zero.
[33:45.84]Oh.
[33:51.17]Oh, shit.
[33:54.03]This is gonna be bad.
[33:56.72]Let me see what's in the other door.
[34:04.69]I click anything when you're streaming, no questions asked.
[34:10.66]How do you throw the axe?
[34:11.64]I can't throw it!
[34:12.16]Oh my god!
[34:15.10]Okay, definitely changing the star- Okay, okay, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[34:24.85]Let's do throwing knives.
[34:27.70]Healing potions.
[34:31.78]Try this again.
[34:32.80]Now, is that bridge gonna be down?
[34:38.63]Did I not go across it?
[34:43.81]Is that right here somewhere or do I have to get back to it?
[34:58.05]Okay, that's what a throwing knife is.
[35:00.83]Do I have infinite amount of those?
[35:05.14]That's the best thing to have in the whole game.
[35:07.96]I have an infinite amount of these.
[35:15.72]Why do you say infinite like that?
[35:17.79]Like what?
[35:18.51]Infinite.
[35:21.07]There's an infinite amount of this.
[35:25.90]Hey dude, my gas station clerk told me you were alive.
[35:30.04]Alright, well, what's up?
[35:35.81]Finally.
[35:40.41]You could remake this in Roblox, but it'd be worse.
[35:44.31]Yeah, you could remake anything in Roblox.
[35:46.74]Isn't that the point?
[35:50.54]You could remake the stream in Roblox.
[35:53.73]And... I don't know.
[35:57.13]Anything can be made in Roblox.
[35:58.54]Old pistol.
[36:01.60]I don't think I want it, but I'll try it.
[36:10.71]The throwing knife is the best.
[36:12.64]Look at this.
[36:14.26]Well, look at this coming up.
[36:16.20]It would be worse if you could still do it.
[36:25.03]Okay, I'm going to save these bullets because this thing seems kind of good.
[36:30.03]They're adding dating to Roblox.
[36:32.86]What are you talking about?
[36:43.91]Did you play Wizard Arena?
[36:45.09]Yeah, we played it for like 20 minutes.
[36:49.97]Okay.
[36:50.72]That's good for this.
[36:59.93]Watch out.
[37:01.45]This takes a long time to reload.
[37:03.29]They were not kidding around.
[37:10.50]Now my kids aren't playing Roblox.
[37:12.46]You know what I'm saying?
[37:19.99]They're starting with Super Mario Brothers.
[37:28.42]You don't have kids.
[37:29.16]What if I do?
[37:29.90]I don't know.
[37:30.22]What if I do eventually?
[37:31.02]You don't know me.
[37:44.02]My kids are not watching Twitch.
[37:50.98]Um, but, no, if I ever have kids, they're starting at the Super Nintendo.
[38:08.25]I'm gonna make sure that they play Super Mario World, you know what I mean?
[38:11.47]Even if it's like a punishment.
[38:14.62]I, wait, did you tell me you got a D- in math?
[38:17.94]Go to your room right now and play Super Mario World.
[38:20.13]Right now.
[38:21.98]Go to your room and play Super Mario.
[38:23.47]Now.
[38:37.95]Yeah, like, okay, let's lead up to that.
[38:40.92]Yeah, I don't like the game.
[38:42.60]It looks old and stupid.
[38:44.48]Okay.
[38:46.08]Okay, Mr. Smart Guy.
[38:47.33]Okay, Mr. Smart Guy.
[38:52.41]You go to your room, and you beat World 1.
[38:54.97]You go beat World 1 through World 2.
[38:58.06]You're on restriction.
[39:01.72]No, I don't want to do that.
[39:02.76]You go beat World 1 right now, mister.
[39:12.56]Okay, move the ammo.
[39:18.02]And this one.
[39:24.27]Maybe I should just take a potion.
[39:25.27]No, I got plenty of health.
[39:26.03]I'm doing good.
[39:26.43]I'm doing good.
[39:26.79]I'm fine.
[39:26.99]I'm fine.
[39:27.19]I'm fine.
[39:35.03]I couldn't beat World 1 as a kid.
[39:36.49]You're going to burn him out on the game.
[39:37.91]I don't want to hear another word out of you until you get to Mallow in Super Mario RPG.
[39:47.19]You understand that, young man?
[39:55.49]What if his daughter?
[40:06.74]Same thing, same rules.
[40:20.06]And if it's siblings, let's say it doesn't matter if it's a boy and a girl, if it's a girl, it doesn't matter.
[40:25.99]All I care about is if I have two, three kids, you get up there and you're beating turtles in time.
[40:31.52]Co-op.
[40:32.78]You need to learn how to work.
[40:33.58]Oh, you pushed your brother?
[40:37.11]Both of you go upstairs right now and you beat turtles in time right now together and learn how to work as a goddamn team.
[40:41.44]You understand that?
[40:50.86]Who's shooting me?
[40:54.64]Oh, my God.
[40:55.14]I didn't even see you.
[40:58.80]I have a... Whoa.
[40:59.54]Okay, this is a shotgun.
[41:02.33]Please listen to the gorilla single already.
[41:06.37]I have to, like... Okay, here's what I have to do to do this.
[41:09.66]To make sure, like, the first part of the stream doesn't get, like, claimed in the second part.
[41:12.98]I got a new computer.
[41:13.98]I didn't set up my channels yet.
[41:15.78]Here's what we have to do.
[41:17.77]This has to be a black screen.
[41:19.99]For like a minute.
[41:21.54]Because this is going to be just a portion where it's just a, hey, copyright.
[41:26.20]Here.
[41:45.69]Alright, let's listen to it.
[41:48.92]Here we go.
[41:50.32]Alright, here we go.
[41:53.99]What's it called?
[42:04.59]The Happy Dictator, okay.
[42:11.30]Is it a banger?
[42:11.86]Is it good?
[42:22.03]Somebody said, it sucks.
[42:24.31]Why do you want me to listen to it?
[42:30.38]I just saw a bunch of people said, oh, it's okay.
[42:31.96]It's alright.
[42:32.56]It's alright.
[42:33.12]You need to listen to it, dude.
[42:34.19]Oh, God, it sucks.
[42:40.88]I'll be the judge of that.
[42:44.68]It does kind of suck.
[42:45.60]Not going to lie.
[42:46.06]What the hell?
[42:46.84]Why am I stopping my stream to listen to this?
[42:53.13]Where can I even listen to it?
[42:58.80]Alright, here it is.
[43:00.63]From like a few hours ago.
[43:05.00]Sign in to confirm you're not a bot.
[43:07.20]What?
[43:07.81]I can't even, I can't, what are you talking about?
[43:23.17]Spoiled again.
[43:24.11]Hold on a second.
[43:29.54]Where can I listen to this?
[43:30.48]Is it because I'm like streaming?
[43:43.05]Did I click a wrong link?
[43:52.65]Alright, hold on.
[43:59.19]There it is.
[43:59.95]Are we ready?
[44:00.41]Sign in or create an account to listen on SoundCloud.
[44:06.97]What the fuck, dude?
[44:20.43]Can one of my mods embed this into the mod chat?
[44:24.65]And I'm not even kidding.
[44:27.06]Thank you, somebody did.
[44:36.45]Oh, god damn it.
[44:37.33]I can't listen to it.
[44:38.17]I actually can't listen to it because... Okay.
[44:47.29]Listen to the Spotify version.
[44:53.08]Okay, so here's what's happening.
[44:54.14]I'm streaming with a VPN right now.
[44:56.20]I usually do that.
[44:57.86]And it apparently does not like that I'm doing that.
[45:01.61]I started doing that to avoid internet problems years ago.
[45:06.59]And I can't open YouTube.
[45:16.00]So I'm going to have to listen to it another time.
[45:19.16]Wait a minute.
[45:19.58]No, I don't.
[45:20.02]Hold on.
[45:20.34]I have a phone.
[45:23.08]Alright, let's listen to it.
[45:24.58]Here we go.
[45:30.47]Happy Dictator Gorillas.
[45:39.08]Here we go.
[45:39.64]I'll turn off my, uh, so you can hear it too.
[45:51.44]Can you guys hear it?
[45:53.93]okay okay okay alright
[46:34.04]sucks time that person up for 10 minutes it's been 10 seconds in the song the do you know about music I like this part
[47:03.19]I like this part a lot.
[47:30.73]Okay.
[47:30.85]Okay.
[47:46.55]Is it this phone speaker?
[47:59.23]That was my phone, I think.
[48:03.44]Is that my phone?
[48:16.09]Okay, it's almost done.
[48:20.38]Somebody said it sounds like drunk karaoke.
[48:22.31]Time that person up.
[48:50.61]Okay.
[48:54.08]Isn't it like a minute?
[49:14.27]It did.
[49:14.73]Okay, I'll tell you.
[49:22.32]Gorillas usually takes like five to ten listens before you get it.
[49:43.26]I actually like hated Saturn Bars when it first came out.
[49:46.33]I was like, this is, I don't know, this is not it.
[49:49.55]And now it's like one of my favorite songs they've made.
[49:58.69]okay well that was it I would give that on the scale I think the last gorilla single that I thought was a like almost a 10 out of 10 was humility uh I'd give that if I'm given humility like a like a 9.6 okay I'll give that that one right now is like a 7.1 it's alright I like the vibe
[50:29.11]I compare to like the last thing that really I really cared about.
[50:33.76]But maybe I have to put it in headphones and kind of really vibe to it.
[50:36.70]You know what I mean?
[50:39.16]People saying it was like a six.
[50:44.55]I mean, guys, I don't rate music.
[50:46.37]Okay.
[50:46.87]I'm not a music rater.
[50:50.74]You guys barely want to hear my video game opinions, let alone my music ones.
[50:54.54]Okay.
[51:00.87]I thought it was alright.
[51:01.59]I... I didn't really vibe with the actual... I guess the... What do you call it when it's just the part of the song that's not the chorus or the bridge?
[51:12.27]Just like the... What do you call it?
[51:15.84]The song.
[51:16.84]Oh.
[51:18.49]The verse.
[51:19.27]The verse parts.
[51:21.03]I did like the chorus and I did like the bridge.
[51:24.57]And I'm just saying the word bridge to pretend like I know what that means.
[51:27.88]I don't know what that means.
[51:28.82]I know it's a part where it kind of... It's the bridge.
[51:33.28]So let me... I like the bridge.
[51:43.93]That's so funny that I couldn't open it because I have a VPN.
[51:50.52]Those of you that remember the old Cox and Comcast days, I did everything necessary to try and get the stream to be stable.
[52:03.51]And it's kind of just stuck ever since.
[52:16.01]That's classic, classic.
[52:17.99]Alright, let's keep going.
[52:26.07]The VPN could make it more unstable.
[52:27.89]It actually helped a lot.
[52:30.42]Anytime I seem to... Because I remember a long time ago, I was having like traffic routing problems.
[52:38.65]Sometimes it would work.
[52:39.53]Sometimes it would be horrible.
[52:40.63]Sometimes it would be so unstable.
[52:42.11]But then I would route my traffic differently.
[52:44.55]And it was like, oh, this actually kind of works fine now.
[52:47.68]And then we learned that the node where we were was a shit node.
[52:54.17]I tried everything.
[53:03.42]Alright, I'm almost... I gotta heal.
[53:13.93]Alright, this is where I gotta be good.
[53:15.15]I feel like this is gonna be like God Zombies eventually.
[53:25.73]And I've never played one second of that game.
[53:27.75]Holy shit.
[53:30.26]Somebody said he didn't like it.
[53:33.34]Somebody's really sad that I wasn't like, let's go to the gorilla single.
[53:38.08]He didn't like it.
[53:41.78]Oh my God.
[53:59.14]Got him.
[53:59.32]No bolts.
[54:04.03]Oh man, you get punished so bad.
[54:06.03]You get punished so bad if you miss a parry.
[54:16.32]Automatic crossbow.
[54:21.25]How does that work?
[54:26.37]Are you playing Roblox?
[54:27.17]This is not Roblox.
[54:30.47]Shut it.
[54:32.15]Hey, shut it.
[54:38.96]I have to get to the... Is there a first boss?
[54:40.55]There's probably a first boss, right?
[54:42.35]I have to get inside the castle.
[54:43.85]This game is about getting into the castle and I'm in the courtyard.
[54:46.46]Ooh.
[54:58.12]Save the bullets on this.
[54:59.52]Save the arrows.
[55:16.27]I feel like me and that guy just made the same sound.
[55:18.04]Hold on a second.
[55:28.01]I'm turning my noise gate back on.
[55:38.91]How did that sound through the phone?
[55:39.95]Did it sound cool when I played that song?
[55:44.93]Have you played Roblox since the Roblox stream?
[55:47.77]No.
[55:49.17]No, I did not.
[55:51.32]I've thought about maybe doing it again, but no, I haven't.
[55:55.12]I'm not playing Roblox.
[55:57.13]That was specifically for somebody's birthday party.
[55:59.89]I was hired to do that.
[56:01.41]For their birthday.
[56:03.34]Oh my god, what is that?
[56:06.20]He's too big to even fit through the door.
[56:07.34]Is it a big baby?
[56:11.74]Oh my god, he kicked a rock at me!
[56:19.85]Ugh!
[56:25.00]Alright, priority.
[56:25.78]Priority.
[56:31.95]When are you gonna play Toontown?
[56:35.68]I'll play that one day.
[56:36.54]I don't know.
[56:43.36]This thing is awesome.
[56:44.71]I gotta get more arrows.
[56:53.40]You promised us this years ago.
[56:57.43]Okay, so this is the shortcut.
[57:00.19]I think I have to get to the end of the shortcut.
[57:05.40]Okay, don't mess around here.
[57:10.85]Get...
[57:12.88]Why are they so much faster down here?
[57:19.33]Please play Toontown.
[57:20.55]Please.
[57:33.51]No more arrows.
[57:34.99]Wait, that's the castle!
[57:40.28]I think I'm going to keep this for now.
[57:41.44]Hold on, let me...
[57:49.13]Let me use all the arrows.
[57:59.34]Swing!
[58:00.86]Swing!
[58:03.92]Why won't he do it?
[58:12.39]Throwing knives.
[58:13.95]I think I'm going to keep this thing.
[58:15.63]It's almost broken, but what is that?
[58:20.78]Are you in easy mode?
[58:21.85]I'm not in easy mode.
[58:23.05]There is no mode.
[58:34.23]Shit.
[58:39.27]Okay.
[58:41.02]Where am I now?
[58:45.82]Alright, there's a shop.
[58:50.13]Alright, do I keep this?
[58:51.55]Do I keep the bow and arrow and just buy arrows?
[58:55.90]Let me see what the other direction is.
[58:57.18]Oh shit.
[59:08.85]I shouldn't have opened this door yet.
[59:15.14]Come and get me.
[59:19.10]Wing.
[59:20.35]Wing!
[59:28.01]Can we have a Minecraft birthday?
[59:32.48]I mean, I... It is... Oh my god!
[59:37.25]It locks behind you.
[59:38.19]The door locks behind you.
[59:39.13]I'm fucked.
[59:47.44]Okay.
[59:47.70]Well, that's good to know.
[59:50.50]Uh, by fee is incredibly expensive.
[59:54.09]If you want me to show up, look, I have five tiers.
[59:56.49]I have show up in regular clothes for 15 minutes.
[60:01.27]Alright, hold on.
[60:02.94]Let me stop that for a second.
[60:06.34]I'm gonna lose right here.
[60:13.87]How much to have you show up naked?
[60:18.66]Stop!
[60:21.80]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[60:37.47]Give me those arrows right now, come on.
[60:46.85]Ooh, whoa, that was actually pretty good.
[60:49.78]Ooh, whoa.
[60:54.05]I feel like I'm pretending to stream right now.
[60:59.66]Do you know what I'm talking about?
[61:00.52]Why do I feel like that?
[61:04.23]I think it's because when I have to focus a lot on a game like this, a word just kind of comes out.
[61:15.52]I go into autopilot mode and it just kind of has me say... Like, you know, pull the string on the back and, like, woody phrases.
[61:27.10]Luck potion.
[61:28.92]Gain extra luck for 30 seconds.
[61:32.04]Okay.
[61:38.17]This really sucks that I... Wait, no, I can go back.
[61:40.93]That's the shortcut.
[61:44.10]I think I'm good, right?
[61:54.93]God forbid you express yourself.
[61:58.47]Thank you.
[62:06.14]Okay, yep, here's the shortcut.
[62:07.20]That was wrapped around... Alright, perfect.
[62:09.06]Thank goodness.
[62:10.02]I can still go to the store.
[62:14.99]I'm watching your... Oh, that got timed out.
[62:16.49]I'm watching your six-hour Smite stream on YouTube.
[62:19.43]You're good at the game.
[62:22.23]You're probably just being, like, funny because I wasn't good at the game.
[62:29.29]Are you being funny?
[62:32.33]You've got potential.
[62:34.96]You're being funny.
[62:40.13]Let me try this.
[62:40.73]Fast reload, fast fire rate.
[62:43.95]I only have two?
[62:45.18]I feel like I want the bow and arrow.
[62:57.64]You got something special there kiddo.
[63:00.98]Alright.
[63:06.81]Any coins in here?
[63:20.41]Let me switch to the actual items.
[63:25.63]It's a hundred coins to heal 10 HP.
[63:27.81]That's crazy.
[63:34.15]Craft two random standard weapons.
[63:36.17]And so, oh, should I wait to buy it to do a gold one?
[63:51.15]I can do bomb.
[63:53.05]I can buy weapon parts.
[63:54.67]Buy two weapon parts and do a heavy weapon.
[63:59.58]I have 3,500.
[64:02.04]Could I just do a legendary weapon right now?
[64:07.12]No.
[64:08.53]I could do a random heavy weapon.
[64:12.23]Is it bad to buy healing?
[64:16.40]I feel like it probably isn't bad to buy healing.
[64:25.99]Stop being weird about my girlfriend.
[64:39.05]I need the potions, I think.
[64:45.01]And then I'm going to buy a wrench.
[64:48.30]And then.
[64:48.76]More of a magazine.
[64:57.28]Maybe more accuracy.
[65:01.68]And then better potions.
[65:04.51]Yeah.
[65:09.54]I should have bought ammo.
[65:17.61]Oh, I can't buy ammo.
[65:19.43]Okay.
[65:22.72]I just have to be good.
[65:23.70]I have to be good at the game.
[65:25.70]You got it?
[65:35.86]I got full heals.
[65:37.10]I have a wrench.
[65:38.70]I don't think this is going to be any good.
[65:40.16]I really don't.
[65:43.09]Alright, cool.
[65:44.79]I'm ready to go up to the castle door.
[65:52.70]Chat likes this game now instead of begging for Toontown and Minecraft.
[65:56.68]Why are people begging for Minecraft?
[66:02.29]I'll take these.
[66:04.53]That gives me a weapon part every time I pick one.
[66:06.33]Wait.
[66:07.83]Okay, so it deletes the other one and it replaces it.
[66:12.71]But I need one more weapon part to do a heavy weapon.
[66:15.90]Alright, here we go.
[66:16.42]Let's do it.
[66:25.17]It's because Squeaks has been playing Minecraft, but he's gone till Monday.
[66:31.81]So we have a bunch of Squeaksers in here looking for me to play the game that their favorite streamer's playing?
[66:37.62]Is that what's going on?
[66:49.42]I hate when they get that close and they don't... Is that a... What is that, a grenade?
[67:00.10]That's actually pretty strong.
[67:01.36]It's stronger than I thought it was going to be.
[67:11.14]Wait, what the fuck?
[67:11.70]This is the sus guy.
[67:14.22]I'm starting to ban that term from my community.
[67:17.17]It's banned.
[67:18.51]It's officially banned.
[67:19.75]As of right now.
[67:21.34]Not my finger.
[67:21.96]It's banned forever.
[67:33.47]She ducked.
[67:37.52]Don't get knocked off the cliff.
[67:38.82]Holy shit.
[67:39.58]What is this guy doing?
[67:40.34]Why is he walking upright as an ape?
[67:42.18]Did you see that?
[67:43.19]That was an ape walking upright.
[67:59.40]Oh, that guy had so much health.
[68:09.45]Are these not... I don't think they can go that far.
[68:12.88]Ooh.
[68:17.82]I don't have any... Why do I not have any ammo?
[68:21.45]Oh, damn it.
[68:34.26]Oh, no, please!
[68:42.39]I'm so lucky.
[68:47.66]Dog, what are you playing?
[68:49.00]This... I'm having fun.
[68:51.68]This game is sick.
[68:52.51]What are you on?
[68:58.79]Finally.
[68:59.34]But... I think I want this.
[69:08.92]I want the weapon parts.
[69:09.80]Alright, so I'm not going to use it here.
[69:11.30]I'm going to get these guys ranged.
[69:17.01]This really is the best ability.
[69:18.73]Maybe a kick is crazy.
[69:33.28]How did I not do that?
[69:45.71]Drop some ammo.
[69:55.16]Finally.
[69:55.68]Speed potion.
[70:02.18]Come on, man.
[70:14.99]Oh, good.
[70:20.81]Okay, I think I can craft some stuff.
[70:28.34]Should I- I already have a heavy- shotgun is heavy.
[70:30.80]I don't know if somebody just wrote, behave.
[70:50.47]Why did you break all of our furniture?
[70:51.77]Because it might have been stuff in there.
[71:03.31]I think I'm going to hold it.
[71:11.82]Where's the one that makes ammo?
[71:18.38]Fire rate, eh.
[71:19.97]Okay.
[71:20.97]20% chance.
[71:22.17]Ah.
[71:27.19]Okay, does this count?
[71:28.98]Or is it just going to reload it?
[71:30.80]If I have the actual ammo.
[71:37.38]Chance to not consume would be good.
[71:40.47]I actually think I'm going to do this.
[71:44.65]And this.
[71:46.75]Because now...
[71:48.89]I can throw these way more often.
[71:50.36]Yeah.
[71:52.78]That's kind of huge.
[71:54.38]Alright.
[71:57.17]I finally made it to the castle.
[72:01.09]Ooh.
[72:04.36]I have two wrenches, three potions, and one... I got all these random potions.
[72:08.14]What is that in there?
[72:12.11]I'm at the guy right now!
[72:20.57]This is King Edgar.
[72:28.04]Oh, fuck.
[72:36.93]Oh.
[72:40.17]Oh.
[72:42.82]Drink the speed potion.
[72:47.10]Why even drink the speed potion?
[72:48.58]What am I doing?
[72:49.36]It's not gonna...
[72:53.69]What the fuck is this thing?
[72:54.69]Dude, what the fuck?
[73:01.06]I didn't expect to have to fight the king right now.
[73:03.34]I couldn't even do anything.
[73:04.56]It takes forever to drink a potion.
[73:10.83]Let me take the stopper out of it and bring it up to my mouth.
[73:17.50]That's the speed potion.
[73:18.46]The guy's slow as shit.
[73:20.64]He's attacking my corpse right now.
[73:29.50]Okay.
[73:30.22]I'm not fucking around.
[73:31.03]Speed runtime.
[73:34.85]Spin.
[73:38.28]More strength.
[73:39.52]I'm going pissed off mode.
[73:46.53]That dude was easier than Pinwheel?
[73:48.02]Obviously not, because I just lost!
[73:51.26]Okay.
[73:58.70]That's a cool move.
[74:09.49]You lost a Pinwheel on stream.
[74:10.97]I did that because I was drunk, okay?
[74:14.56]I was shit-faced.
[74:15.42]I was drunk.
[74:19.18]Ooh.
[74:20.15]Fires three arrows at once.
[74:30.52]Alright, that thing is awesome saving that for King Edgar.
[74:44.31]OK, cool.
[74:50.36]This is a bedroom.
[75:03.34]Going fast.
[75:06.69]Speed increase, good.
[75:11.43]Gonna make me fight King Edgar in the first room.
[75:32.64]Oh, you little shit!
[75:36.37]Oh my fucking god.
[75:41.90]Get your fucking spit out of here!
[76:01.95]How did I miss three arrows?
[76:10.89]I am getting upset.
[76:20.54]I think I'm gonna keep the bow if I can.
[76:24.77]And just cheeseball the boss, I think.
[76:33.12]Hello.
[76:35.56]Okay.
[76:37.80]I could do sword.
[76:39.03]I think I'm just going to go all sword.
[76:41.71]Just strength, range, strength.
[76:52.20]Hit a wheel with this item to automatically activate it for you?
[76:56.26]What does that mean?
[76:58.02]Hit a wheel with this item.
[77:02.67]I don't get it.
[77:06.81]What does that mean?
[77:07.31]I hit a wheel.
[77:15.69]It activates the wheel you have to turn.
[77:21.58]What?
[77:27.39]I mean, I've thrown like ten of them.
[77:35.17]The opening gate thing.
[77:38.79]Oh, like that.
[77:42.58]Oh, I don't want that.
[77:50.79]Y'all that work full screen watching this, that is that's dude that you you got to put me in a like 200 by 200 pixel window.
[78:02.18]Are you crazy?
[78:09.43]You should be fired.
[78:13.91]Oh, I have to play the game.
[78:28.99]Look at that.
[78:29.27]That's when we talk about melee damage.
[78:50.57]Stunning.
[78:56.01]Opening shift at work watching this.
[78:57.42]I have so many arrows.
[79:01.70]I have to repair this bow.
[79:03.58]I think it's going to work out well.
[79:07.33]I don't have any potions.
[79:15.88]Here we go.
[79:25.95]Come on, legendary.
[79:27.62]Old pistol.
[79:28.90]No, I'm gonna have to... I don't lose the arrows, right?
[79:35.53]I think I keep the arrows.
[79:39.57]This guy sucks.
[79:40.19]He keeps talking over the walkthrough.
[79:51.89]Oh my god.
[79:57.71]Okay.
[80:00.06]Why is there no game audio?
[80:04.08]You liar.
[80:04.90]Don't do that.
[80:15.51]Get it loaded.
[80:26.64]That range is so bad.
[80:27.94]What the hell are you talking about?
[80:34.34]I just like... How did everything miss?
[80:38.43]That's so inaccurate.
[80:39.55]This thing sucks.
[80:50.24]It says poor accuracy.
[80:52.48]I know.
[80:53.22]You're right.
[80:55.32]I know.
[81:02.16]Okay, you gotta be shitting me.
[81:14.27]This is bad.
[81:17.36]Oh my fucking god, dude.
[81:22.92]Where is she?
[81:23.68]Where the fuck did she go?
[81:24.80]She- hell if she blended in with the screen, what?
[81:33.71]That was a bad run.
[81:51.23]I should have kept the bow.
[81:52.71]Yeah, you're right.
[81:57.92]I should have kept the bow.
[82:07.55]these are so good though they actually are really good what should you eat today how about a uh a glass of milk and now how about you know how would you you should have some porridge today okay
[82:46.41]How did I not block it?
[82:47.65]Alright, I'm starting to lose my gamer ability.
[82:49.04]I'm being like too angry.
[82:51.10]I gotta slow down.
[82:53.20]There's a dodge.
[82:53.98]Yeah, look.
[82:54.38]Ready?
[82:55.28]One.
[82:56.25]Two.
[82:57.21]Three.
[82:58.17]Four.
[82:59.13]Five.
[83:00.67]Six.
[83:00.77]It is a six second cooldown.
[83:14.83]Oh.
[83:18.61]Not one of these guys, please.
[83:27.20]Get me away, please.
[83:38.09]Those guys are actually awful.
[83:49.79]Okay.
[83:50.49]Okay.
[83:50.73]Nobody else.
[83:51.88]Debug.
[83:55.72]Why do you always sound upset?
[83:56.78]Because he hates streaming.
[83:59.45]I'm not... Wait.
[84:00.35]I'm not upset.
[84:00.99]I'm having fun.
[84:02.09]I'm hanging out.
[84:02.59]I'm having a good time.
[84:04.53]What are you talking about?
[84:07.92]Are you not having... Are you upset?
[84:11.00]At what?
[84:12.24]Why are you upset with me?
[84:20.37]Is this Bloodborne if it was good and not bad?
[84:23.78]Should I get upset now?
[84:26.54]Would that warrant a response from me?
[84:41.22]And how severe should that response be?
[84:44.66]Would that be a timeout?
[84:45.71]Should it be a shouting match?
[84:51.54]What do you guys think?
[84:56.27]Okay, this room sucks.
[84:58.29]No, it doesn't.
[84:58.61]I thought that was one of the screaming ladies.
[85:10.65]Am I certain I can't open doors?
[85:13.26]It said there are hidden things everywhere.
[85:14.80]I haven't seen anything.
[85:22.86]Some of these guys are fast.
[85:33.23]I have so many arrows.
[85:39.28]Alright, I think I want a weapon.
[85:40.76]And I'm not going to hoard the crafting things this time.
[85:48.07]What do I got?
[85:48.41]A thousand?
[85:55.90]I have to buy the potions.
[85:58.30]It isn't necessary.
[85:59.00]I'm sorry.
[85:59.36]It just is.
[86:03.63]How do you make porridge?
[86:04.69]I actually have no idea what porridge even is.
[86:09.78]You know what I mean?
[86:10.30]What is porridge?
[86:12.20]I just see it as just slop.
[86:15.08]It's just slop.
[86:16.61]It's like gray slop.
[86:18.31]What is it?
[86:20.51]Is it like wheat?
[86:22.35]Is it like oatmeal?
[86:25.72]Is it wheat-based?
[86:26.82]Is it dairy-based?
[86:27.96]What is porridge?
[86:29.14]It's oatmeal, right?
[86:30.09]It's just actually oatmeal.
[86:34.61]It's oat and water.
[86:38.16]It's just soupy oatmeal.
[86:41.62]Well, that's not that bad.
[86:44.59]I actually... I like oatmeal.
[86:45.75]I wouldn't... Wait.
[86:48.98]Why does it look weird?
[86:57.02]I love Cream of Wheat unironically.
[86:58.76]Yeah, I probably would actually like it.
[87:00.23]Alright, it's a hard big room coming up here.
[87:13.80]No, next one I think.
[87:24.70]Come on, swing.
[87:26.98]Swing.
[87:29.48]They picked the worst time to swing.
[87:36.20]So many throwing knives.
[87:39.42]This is the run.
[87:44.81]You have a peasant pallet?
[87:47.21]It's funny, actually, creamed corn, I actually saw it in the grocery store pretty recently.
[87:54.46]And I was like, actually, that sounds kind of good.
[87:58.88]And isn't that the joke in every movie, which is like, oh, no, you know, eat your creamed corn.
[88:03.25]Oh, bleh, that's disgusting, mate.
[88:05.87]Eat your creamed corn, your porridge, and your stale bread.
[88:09.04]Actually sounds kind of great to me.
[88:11.10]That sounds like a meal that I want.
[88:18.29]That's from Pete and Pete.
[88:23.30]And you also meet Artie, the strongest man in the world.
[88:30.53]Artie was a developmental character for me.
[88:35.81]And if you want to see, I got a lot of inspiration came from Artie, the strongest man in the world.
[88:43.16]Let's just say a lot.
[88:57.09]Am I invulnerable when I do that?
[89:03.48]Chance to not consume ammo.
[89:05.62]Sick.
[89:15.65]Yeah, when Artie and Pete fight the ocean, that's like one of my favorite episodes of television.
[89:20.68]He's like, we will defeat it!
[89:22.30]Punch it!
[89:23.42]They're punching the water.
[89:25.04]And they beat the ocean together.
[89:28.10]And then there's also one where he lifts a house.
[89:30.07]He lifts a house like three inches off the ground.
[89:34.19]It's like, there's no way.
[89:35.75]Artie didn't have superpowers, but he kind of did.
[89:39.60]He was just kind of a guy, but he lifted a house one day on his own.
[89:44.86]Only like an inch.
[89:49.00]That's so funny.
[89:50.33]What show are you talking about?
[89:51.17]Pete and Pete.
[89:52.09]An old Nickelodeon show.
[89:58.26]And then there's the heartfelt moment.
[90:00.50]When Artie, who was by the way only in a handful of episodes.
[90:04.71]He was only in like a quarter of a season or something.
[90:07.07]Like half a season.
[90:09.24]When he leaves because another kid needs his help.
[90:14.56]Okay, hold on quiet.
[90:18.51]I don't think I'm invulnerable doing that.
[90:24.80]Oh my goodness, man.
[90:27.64]Don't already do something!
[90:39.75]You piece of shit!
[90:50.34]How much health do you have?
[90:51.54]Grr!
[90:58.84]Fight me!
[91:01.12]Oh my god.
[91:05.41]Okay.
[91:10.43]He's like, Oh, young Pete.
[91:13.77]I need to go.
[91:15.88]There'll always be a place in your heart for me.
[91:20.54]For I am Arty!
[91:22.34]Strongest man in the world.
[91:27.38]Another small boy or girl is going to need my help.
[91:33.32]That was actually a pretty locked in impression.
[91:40.35]He's definitely zoinked today.
[91:41.49]I can't just have a fun childhood memory.
[91:54.15]My mom says she didn't like that show because they were stupid.
[92:02.44]Let me go to the... No, I'll go to the shop after.
[92:04.97]We gotta grind.
[92:08.55]He's definitely on drugs.
[92:09.41]I'm not... I... You know what?
[92:11.33]Whatever you say.
[92:23.71]The window for parry is actually pretty good.
[92:34.64]We're not going up there yet, but I do want the money.
[92:38.55]He's not on drugs.
[92:39.13]He's on a grind set.
[92:41.05]Thank you.
[92:41.47]Thank you.
[92:44.17]Throwing knives, I don't want.
[92:47.58]I want something else.
[92:58.47]Boink.
[93:03.95]There's loot in the bodies that are hanging, really.
[93:07.28]Are you serious?
[93:09.84]That's huge, if that's true.
[93:13.09]Wait, did you see one?
[93:21.04]Should every game have throwing knives?
[93:22.34]Um... Yeah.
[93:25.65]I can understand why.
[93:31.05]Oh, yes.
[93:33.34]Okay.
[93:34.56]Now don't consume arrows.
[93:35.88]We need to use these for the king.
[93:43.54]What does this say?
[93:45.68]Watch your step.
[93:46.28]These rapids are not meant for swimming.
[93:48.79]So don't go in there.
[93:51.05]Okay.
[93:51.19]Okay.
[93:59.93]1600.
[94:01.19]What can I do?
[94:05.63]Craft two random projectile weapons and select one.
[94:09.88]Is there a better bow?
[94:11.12]I might be able to get a better bow.
[94:14.06]How much is this?
[94:21.89]I might be able to get a better bow.
[94:23.33]Maybe is the three arrows good?
[94:36.97]asking questions about the game hey if I craft two projectiles and uh and everyone's just like look at the girl there's a girl look I'm like please help me with the game you guys are so distracted I'm doing it a frying pan that sucks
[95:07.56]Well, I already have this.
[95:12.07]Do I do it again?
[95:19.56]Can you even read chat?
[95:20.66]Everyone's too distracted.
[95:32.26]Hot goth?
[95:33.44]I'm not gonna read that, but okay.
[95:40.38]Uh, maybe I'll get a bomb.
[95:44.55]Okay, I'm going for it.
[95:46.25]I just got a bunch of bombs.
[95:48.45]So... I'm just gonna hopefully throw these at the king.
[95:53.20]And let's hope it works.
[95:54.20]I'm taking a speed potion before I go into that door.
[95:57.76]And try not to use arrows.
[96:03.61]Wait, any items?
[96:07.97]When are you going to build the water park?
[96:10.00]I don't know.
[96:12.00]Maybe in a little bit.
[96:13.66]Oh, let me check to see if the... I didn't know there was... I'm just seeing if the horsemen... I think we might be horsemen not horsemening today.
[96:31.75]Judging by looks like maybe not.
[96:36.02]But it's all good.
[96:37.46]We can reschedule.
[96:40.67]All good.
[96:41.73]Alright.
[96:42.51]I need to grind items.
[96:45.30]Or should I just go fight the boss?
[96:46.48]Because look at all this shit in here.
[96:47.80]I'm going to die in here.
[96:51.11]Look at this guy.
[96:51.49]This guy has got me.
[96:52.53]Got my number.
[96:55.18]Did I grind?
[97:07.49]Brine?
[97:08.47]You got it.
[97:22.02]Oof.
[97:22.54]Okay.
[97:23.34]Good.
[97:24.08]What is going on?
[97:25.31]They do teleport.
[97:26.35]I wasn't crazy.
[97:39.39]I'm just trying to get arrows.
[97:41.61]Honestly.
[97:51.26]Why's that guy blue?
[97:52.16]Oh.
[97:56.92]I don't know why this song is in my head right now, but it is.
[98:04.47]I'm in trouble.
[98:04.97]I gotta run.
[98:05.57]Run.
[98:08.69]Oh, fuck.
[98:18.97]What the hell?
[98:19.98]I timed it.
[98:32.39]Oh my god, I lost so much.
[98:44.71]That's too much health to lose.
[98:45.95]I have to... I need to heal again.
[98:48.79]Okay.
[99:10.38]Oh, the song.
[99:16.30]What is that?
[99:29.99]Kablam!
[99:30.67]There it is.
[99:31.29]Oh, that's massive.
[99:43.91]Am I crazy?
[99:48.41]Did they do a 3D episode one day where you had to get 3D glasses and it was a huge deal?
[99:53.68]I remember this.
[99:55.41]There was an... Ow!
[99:56.73]What the fuck happened to my chair?
[99:57.97]Oh my... What the hell?
[100:02.56]Yeah, there was an episode that they teased for weeks and weeks.
[100:06.42]Make sure you get your 3D glasses.
[100:11.21]And the whole episode was in, uh, stereo, graphic, whatever, 3D.
[100:18.50]I was fu- And they jumped at the screen a bunch and stuff.
[100:20.38]Actually, it was pretty cool.
[100:21.22]It was awesome.
[100:21.73]Why don't they do that anymore?
[100:24.55]How come they don't do weird shit like that anymore?
[100:26.21]It's like, everybody get re- Why is one of my streams not in 3D one day?
[100:30.96]What am I doing?
[100:33.10]I had to hype that up for weeks and months.
[100:35.62]Sell 3D glasses that is just the 3D glasses that you all know.
[100:40.37]And then the stream is in 3D one day.
[100:49.78]Alright, here we go.
[100:58.57]No arrows.
[100:59.63]Only melee.
[101:04.64]My melee is so weak anyways right now.
[101:10.26]No, you wouldn't be able to watch it without 3D- Didn't I do this before?
[101:14.41]I have a distinct memory of me taking my webcam and splitting it and doing it bright blue and then doing it bright red and having two versions of me that I superimposed on top of each other.
[101:26.30]I did that, didn't I?
[101:30.69]I did do that.
[101:31.57]That was a long time ago.
[101:46.12]Come on.
[101:47.54]Come on.
[101:52.34]Alright.
[101:52.56]I've got 36 arrows.
[101:55.95]It's like 2018.
[101:56.37]Hold on.
[102:06.64]I don't want to go off the edge here.
[102:08.94]That range is stupid.
[102:10.78]Look at how stupid that range is.
[102:24.93]I don't need that.
[102:42.72]I don't need that either, but does that work for the bow?
[102:45.06]I hope so.
[102:55.00]That move, I'm not a fan of, actually.
[102:57.78]I'd rather have the overhead swing.
[103:07.40]I don't know, he threw a rock at me!
[103:13.23]I panicked!
[103:19.82]Dark Souls.
[103:36.22]If I can't beat this boss with 54 arrows, then I don't know if I ever will be able to.
[103:40.89]But there... No, I can't.
[103:43.31]I can't do it.
[103:46.54]I can't.
[103:47.06]Because I'm going to only have... Wait, how many... Where can I see... Can I see how much ammo I have?
[103:53.19]Because that's arrows.
[103:55.11]Does this count?
[103:58.17]I think the three arrows is better.
[104:01.52]Hey, I'm sorry your chat members are so weird and mean.
[104:09.30]They're definitely weird.
[104:15.33]Alright, what do I want to do?
[104:19.36]Hmm.
[104:22.16]Maybe this.
[104:24.57]Or maybe that.
[104:31.66]Maybe fire rate?
[104:35.96]Dodge regen.
[104:37.38]I think I want to do this.
[104:38.13]I think.
[104:39.65]How much health do I have?
[104:43.72]Okay.
[104:43.90]I've got full healing potions.
[104:45.50]I'm going to do speed.
[104:49.30]Regen.
[104:53.91]Okay.
[104:54.77]I'm ready.
[104:56.96]My longbow is pretty good.
[104:58.20]I got.
[104:59.76]Okay.
[105:00.02]I'm drinking this.
[105:00.92]Then I'm throwing three bombs.
[105:04.19]And then I gotta switch back to the heals.
[105:08.56]Here we go.
[105:12.14]And I'm gonna use this right now.
[105:21.27]You ready?
[105:29.38]That didn't do anything!
[105:44.29]Ow!
[106:03.99]Ah!
[106:21.08]I forgot what buttons do what.
[106:43.64]Stop!
[106:57.46]Oh my god.
[107:00.36]What are you talking about?
[107:03.75]What the fuck?
[107:08.53]That's such dog shit, dude.
[107:10.56]I got juggled in the air by the- I couldn't do anything.
[107:13.36]That was such a huge choke.
[107:14.48]No, it wasn't a choke.
[107:16.07]It was- I got- I couldn't do anything.
[107:18.19]I was trying to drink a fucking potion.
[107:22.27]It's so stupid.
[107:30.38]was that?
[107:31.90]I still had like 50 or 40, I had like 50% HP left.
[107:35.79]And he had the fire on the ground in the corner, and it was just 1, 2, 3, 4, I couldn't do anything.
[107:42.42]That was so dumb.
[107:48.17]Get guilty gear comboed?
[107:49.73]Yeah, it was fucked up.
[107:52.58]Hold on, wait a minute.
[107:56.16]No, I want my, I want to change my items.
[108:02.61]I had him too.
[108:03.70]I was parrying shit.
[108:04.62]It's just he did the fire in such a position where it was just, I was just fucked.
[108:17.90]Uh, there's a naked peck?
[108:32.72]Defeat Cormac ten times.
[108:35.26]Destroy all ten hidden coins.
[108:43.65]So wait, that's not even Cormac.
[108:46.11]Fuck.
[108:52.14]That was like Cormac's uncle, Edward.
[108:55.09]I have to beat him.
[108:58.21]I have to beat him.
[109:01.09]New strategy.
[109:02.23]Overhead attack.
[109:04.05]More melee damage.
[109:07.02]Let's go.
[109:09.06]I'm going for it.
[109:16.17]I gotta pee.
[109:17.19]No pees yet.
[109:18.17]I'll pee after this.
[109:22.36]Also...
[109:26.87]This has got to change because this originally was shift.
[109:31.90]I'm going to put block on spacebar.
[109:33.42]I think it's much easier to do that considering the dodge is not that effective.
[109:39.21]I should be doing block almost every time.
[109:42.73]It's in a much better spot.
[109:45.52]I thought it was going to be a big dodge roll game, but it's not.
[109:52.17]It's just a parry game.
[109:54.87]Now I gotta get my muscle memory back.
[110:02.24]That's good.
[110:08.73]Hey, why the tuna are you using keyboard and mouse?
[110:15.14]Why did you say it like that?
[110:16.92]Why the tuna?
[110:18.90]I feel like that's like a- you're like a kitten or like a cat.
[110:21.20]Like, why the tuna are you doing this?
[110:23.20]It's like that funny cat face that's like the erm cat face.
[110:36.48]-2, yikes.
[110:38.68]Get out of here, stop.
[110:42.79]Holy -2.
[110:48.01]Oh, relax.
[110:51.67]Oh.
[111:04.42]You know how bad I want to do a Power Stone tournament for the Dreamcast?
[111:08.26]You understand how bad I want to do that?
[111:09.54]You understand how I've been yearning for that for like a fucking 10 years?
[111:15.29]Ooh.
[111:16.85]Frying pan.
[111:22.53]Oh, you actually throw it!
[111:37.96]Uh, this thing needs to be repaired and it has to be the only thing I use.
[111:41.09]Is this a melee weapon technically?
[111:57.28]Stop pissing me off.
[112:01.61]Fuck you.
[112:11.97]What the tuna?
[112:13.59]It's funny.
[112:14.57]It's cute.
[112:15.63]It's fine.
[112:16.58]Don't pick that up.
[112:33.31]Here I am.
[112:37.95]Hmm.
[112:55.41]Hmm.
[113:01.20]What are you guys doing?
[113:02.02]Now that's all you guys are saying.
[113:16.08]Somebody said, I know she streams dead by daylight.
[113:19.73]What are you talking about?
[113:23.59]What are you talking about?
[113:24.59]I think it's this.
[113:40.33]And then this.
[113:42.90]And then I'll switch over.
[113:44.78]And I'm doing fine.
[113:45.98]Let's go.
[113:46.54]Speedrun.
[113:47.30]I need a repair wrench.
[113:49.63]Very soon.
[113:50.51]Because this thing... I'm fighting Edgar with this thing.
[113:54.39]And I'm going to kick his ass.
[114:18.79]I think I have to drop his sensitivity too.
[114:21.41]I'm overcompensating.
[114:23.06]A lot.
[114:43.94]Maybe not that much.
[114:51.80]That's a little better, OK.
[114:55.49]So good.
[115:07.98]Is that a bigger bug or am I crazy?
[115:23.22]I need potions and I need a wrench.
[115:26.88]Deals more damage the less health you have?
[115:30.15]That thing's cool.
[115:31.23]It's new.
[115:31.85]The less health that I have, it does more damage.
[115:45.50]Alright, now I gotta make sure I have ammo.
[115:49.97]I can't believe I dropped the pan, though.
[115:51.37]That's not good.
[115:56.08]I pressed the wrong button.
[116:08.59]That is so much better than the spin.
[116:09.99]It's not even funny.
[116:13.42]Good.
[116:14.06]I'll take it.
[116:21.67]Hey dude, I'm listening to Kiss from a Rose.
[116:23.67]It's a good song.
[116:29.42]There used to be a tree in town, alone on the sea.
[116:42.74]You'd be there in the night, on the dark night of me.
[116:50.29]Love remains a drug that's my life.
[116:57.65]eyes become a legend the light that you shine can't be seen baby
[117:29.24]Now that was a big swing.
[117:33.05]Can we get a Lala, please?
[117:34.40]What year is it?
[117:35.40]Why are you stuck on one thing from like six and a half years ago?
[117:46.39]Yes, I do the ooh, ah, ooh thing.
[117:50.41]Dude, you remember when we... One of my favorite award show things that we used to do.
[118:00.57]I mean, that was a category.
[118:01.85]That was like one of my favorite categories ever.
[118:08.44]Because I think I disagreed.
[118:15.26]You're talking like a couple years ago was a decade ago.
[118:18.97]Well, I mean, it has been like two plus years.
[118:21.65]And I have no health.
[118:31.12]You could bring it back.
[118:33.67]No, I don't think so.
[118:36.79]I don't think so.
[118:37.53]Let's see how much damage this does.
[118:39.07]A lot.
[118:46.02]I kind of need to go the other way.
[118:54.26]Well, for a few reasons.
[118:55.30]One, I don't really stream as much as I... Hold on a second.
[119:01.91]It's going to be death if I don't... I had to use the bolts.
[119:13.68]Unfortunate, but I did.
[119:19.98]I don't stream as much to get as many potential nominations.
[119:27.23]And I also am a person that when I think something's done, it's kind of just done.
[119:32.70]And I don't really want to just keep doing it just to do it.
[119:34.92]I'd rather it be good and people remember that it was fun and good than just continue to do it over and over and over again just because.
[119:44.17]I don't really.
[119:45.70]Because then what, like then if you do one and it's like, oh, the clips weren't that, they were okay, but.
[119:51.71]Remember how good it used to be?
[119:52.81]Remember how good it was like two or three years ago?
[120:01.59]I'd rather be something fun to remember, not something to continue to do forever.
[120:13.33]What made you want to play this game?
[120:14.58]My grandma hit me up.
[120:16.50]She said, let me tell you something you've got.
[120:18.48]This new game came out on Steam.
[120:20.45]You gotta try it.
[120:23.47]That boss, Edgar, he's super difficult.
[120:31.49]Alright, I need to heal.
[120:32.85]And I need healing potions.
[120:35.06]Now.
[120:44.94]Why is she pissed?
[120:46.54]Oh.
[120:47.45]Because I don't have any money.
[120:54.52]Okay.
[120:56.32]Now I have heals.
[120:58.14]I've got a repair thing.
[121:00.89]Let me try this again.
[121:02.57]Let's go.
[121:11.70]Why are all these people here?
[121:16.75]Help!
[121:19.68]Help!
[121:22.16]Help!
[121:22.73]Help!
[121:23.37]Help!
[121:25.35]Deckard Cain.
[121:26.55]Move quickly.
[121:28.78]Deckard Cain.
[121:29.54]Deckard Cain.
[121:30.62]We've got to get out of here.
[121:46.69]That was a terrible Deckard Cain.
[121:48.09]Have you played the game?
[121:49.03]That wasn't Deckard Cain.
[121:50.19]That was De- Help!
[121:51.64]Help!
[121:53.24]That was, but then it was the Barbarian.
[121:55.24]Do you know anything?
[121:56.44]Why did all this shit spawn?
[122:17.60]Don't call me a scrub.
[122:22.55]No, this is really not good.
[122:30.79]Well, at least I can buy more health.
[122:44.26]This game is a, eh, game where you do that.
[122:46.85]Okay.
[122:47.05]Now I gotta go buy more health.
[122:48.55]No.
[122:48.89]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[122:49.77]There's another place up there.
[122:51.13]Watch this.
[122:58.62]I'm only gonna stand in the same spot and parry the boss.
[123:01.85]And shoot him point blank.
[123:03.79]I think.
[123:05.09]Or maybe not.
[123:06.09]I'm only gonna try to parry him.
[123:08.40]And hopefully I don't get juggled again.
[123:09.66]That was awful.
[123:19.87]Why are there so many enemies right here?
[123:38.73]I have to shoot this.
[123:40.19]Yeah.
[123:41.47]This is gonna be bad.
[123:42.19]I know it.
[123:43.83]What a terrible place for you to be.
[123:47.55]Such an awful position.
[123:54.82]See what I'm talking about?
[123:56.64]Hold on.
[124:00.51]I don't want this to break.
[124:08.96]You gonna let me get this?
[124:13.12]Uh, no.
[124:21.59]Alright.
[124:26.09]Good, glad I got that.
[124:30.07]Don't, I'm gonna try not to use any more bullets.
[124:42.89]Okay, I have to make sure my hands aren't sweating.
[124:46.32]The bombs were useless.
[124:47.56]They did absolutely nothing at all.
[124:50.11]So I'm not doing that again.
[124:52.13]I need to... I don't think I need... There's a repair wrench right here.
[124:55.94]So I don't think I need another one.
[125:01.80]Good.
[125:02.02]Alright.
[125:02.25]I got plenty of ammo.
[125:04.15]Let's get to full health.
[125:05.41]I have 2,000 coins.
[125:06.89]Anything important.
[125:13.38]Maybe this.
[125:15.50]Or maybe this.
[125:17.52]Potions are way better.
[125:18.32]I don't know.
[125:31.70]But I have to do this for sure.
[125:44.76]I think I'm going to do the better potions.
[125:48.51]And that.
[125:51.65]And that.
[125:55.06]And that.
[126:00.18]Okay.
[126:02.11]Alright.
[126:02.63]It's time.
[126:03.11]I have to do it this time.
[126:04.49]Let me wipe my hand.
[126:10.08]I'm going to unload on them only when I need to.
[126:16.13]So it's all about parries and swing.
[126:18.64]Here we go.
[127:19.18]Yeah!
[127:38.13]Dude, he speeds up his attack.
[127:39.87]He speeds up.
[127:43.03]Okay.
[127:44.84]Got him.
[127:47.42]That was way easier than running around trying to shoot him with a projectile.
[127:50.23]Okay, so what else?
[128:01.00]That's so mean, though.
[128:02.18]I'll tell you, that's mean.
[128:04.58]To get... His timings change, he gets faster.
[128:08.33]And it messes up your timings, because you're... That was fun.
[128:14.54]Now I have a ton... I didn't use any ammo, really, at all.
[128:17.93]Oh.
[128:18.59]What's next?
[128:19.90]Okay, that was the front door.
[128:23.76]Okay.
[128:26.06]Now what?
[128:28.41]Only a thousand coins for doing that?
[128:29.83]There's a secret back here.
[128:38.74]That doesn't give you money?
[128:43.07]He'll play this but not Bloodborne.
[128:44.93]I've played Bloodborne like 200 times.
[128:49.88]Oh, this is a giga chest.
[129:09.65]Probably this one.
[129:18.46]Okay, do I get a checkpoint?
[129:19.51]Or does it... Uh-oh.
[129:22.25]Oh, God.
[129:26.80]Do I have a flashlight?
[129:30.93]This is awful.
[129:36.10]This is way too dark.
[129:37.49]Okay, there we go.
[129:37.93]I have a lantern.
[129:48.10]Great.
[129:59.07]Okay, that's me.
[130:10.91]Up or down?
[130:13.15]I can't even go up.
[130:19.94]Kind of weird you had to defeat the king to... Oh, well.
[130:26.95]Why do we have Juliet telekinesis?
[130:37.97]Oh, oops.
[130:52.51]Yeah, okay.
[130:53.73]You think I'm gonna turn the corner?
[130:59.04]Jesus!
[131:17.30]Okay.
[131:17.42]This shotgun kinda stinks.
[131:26.60]I like this area.
[131:35.03]Hello there.
[131:36.21]Okay.
[131:39.11]I gotta pick a theme.
[131:48.88]Do I just go all in on melee?
[131:55.65]I think I have to.
[131:58.10]Better dodge.
[132:01.89]My queen.
[132:18.58]Okay.
[132:18.70]Somebody said sit like a normal person.
[132:22.02]Whoa!
[132:41.74]Yeah, why was he just climbing?
[132:43.00]Okay, I need to heal.
[132:48.69]He's just chilling.
[132:59.30]I'll try it again.
[133:06.17]Alright.
[133:06.71]Are bombs awful?
[133:10.23]Find out.
[133:19.56]Spectile, bullets, accuracy.
[133:22.56]Okay.
[133:34.66]Swing.
[133:36.13]Swing!
[133:42.72]Why are you being so weird?
[133:49.65]Fast reload.
[133:55.00]I kind of want this instead.
[133:59.14]Fast reload revolver.
[134:02.43]Healing potion.
[134:03.37]Nice.
[134:03.91]Okay.
[134:04.72]Don't want to use the bomb.
[134:20.21]I thought that was a different enemy.
[134:21.59]It was just a regular guy.
[134:24.03]He was moving real fast down those stairs.
[134:25.43]I just kind of decided.
[134:31.08]What was it?
[134:31.48]Just money?
[134:35.34]Are you going to finish Saw 2?
[134:36.94]I don't think so.
[134:47.27]Secret?
[134:48.59]No.
[134:51.46]Should you buy this game?
[134:52.60]If you like this kind of game and you like what you're seeing, I think it's fun.
[134:57.41]I'm having fun.
[135:01.05]I've yet to come across as something I really didn't like.
[135:05.96]It's just a fun little game.
[135:06.92]It's fun.
[135:11.93]Shit.
[135:20.60]How much is it?
[135:21.36]I think it's... Let's see.
[135:24.71]How much is it?
[135:26.39]I think it's like $10?
[135:26.98]$20?
[135:27.56]It just came out.
[135:41.24]It is not $60.
[135:42.15]What are you talking about?
[135:51.04]It is... It is $9 right now.
[135:57.39]It is less than $10.
[135:58.25]Okay, let me scroll down.
[136:10.19]Yeah, $9.
[136:14.13]Honestly, that's majorly worth it.
[136:19.01]I definitely feel like I've gotten nine dollars of fun out of this.
[136:21.77]A hundred percent.
[136:37.31]No, I don't want it.
[136:44.14]Is the game a little clunky?
[136:46.92]Yeah, it's part of the charm, though.
[136:50.14]Does the game feel good to play?
[136:52.26]Absolutely.
[136:52.68]Is it interesting enough where I think it's still worth continuing?
[136:58.19]Absolutely.
[137:00.02]I think it's great.
[137:00.74]I like it.
[137:09.23]I'm not going that way.
[137:12.33]When you don't like a game, you usually call it cute.
[137:15.30]Well, no, that doesn't mean I don't like it.
[137:16.66]It just means I don't really want to play it.
[137:20.72]No, it means that it's fine.
[137:22.67]There's nothing wrong with it.
[137:23.71]It's just like a fun whatever.
[137:25.27]That got one person.
[137:38.62]This game needs work.
[137:41.33]That is one of the best things I've heard in a long time.
[137:44.65]It's the same thing.
[137:45.19]I'll get the weapon part for it.
[137:57.61]Good.
[138:00.45]Why is your face in the auction picture?
[138:02.22]Oh, okay.
[138:02.76]Hold on.
[138:04.10]It's been long enough.
[138:04.84]We can talk about this again.
[138:05.64]I talked about it very briefly in the beginning of the stream.
[138:07.87]Right now, DougDoug is doing a charity stream.
[138:12.94]He's got raffles and auctions to benefit the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
[138:18.79]And I have an item in this auction.
[138:23.34]Now, check it out.
[138:24.14]It's gonna be over the next couple more days.
[138:26.75]No, don't tell people I want to win.
[138:29.21]Well, I'm telling people.
[138:31.99]Uh, the item that I have, to maybe be a little bit on theme with, uh, the event, it is my Dreamcast microphone.
[138:41.06]I gave the Seaman Dreamcast mic, the one that I used on stream to play Seaman, uh, and I signed it.
[138:49.48]So...
[138:50.88]if you want it if you want to go bid on it the last time I checked it was a few hundred bucks um it was it there's a link to it we I think we're putting it up every 15 20 minutes anyways but go support it wasn't that up someone's ass whoa
[139:28.43]This is such a tiny place to fight this guy.
[139:36.46]Alright, revolver or fast revolver?
[139:40.73]Which one's better?
[139:44.83]Stop avoiding the question.
[139:46.20]I don't think I put it up my ass.
[139:48.86]I don't remember doing that.
[139:50.32]I'm pretty sure that didn't happen.
[139:58.79]Revolver or cooler revolver?
[140:00.57]Is this one actually better?
[140:02.05]Is the other one a weaker?
[140:02.81]Or is this one shoot slower but do more damage?
[140:18.31]Fast reloads, fast fire rate.
[140:20.45]So this one's worse.
[140:25.13]I would get a weapon part for it.
[140:28.84]OK.
[140:33.39]Oh, shit.
[140:38.13]Oh, boy, that's a lot of people.
[140:55.71]We.
[141:00.90]Uh-oh.
[141:02.03]I just wanted to look.
[141:05.45]Oh, no.
[141:07.91]Oh, no.
[141:11.54]Oh, thank God.
[141:19.07]What's the range on this?
[141:22.40]Can I shoot one of those Game Boy-looking people over here?
[141:30.17]Okay.
[141:30.29]Okay.
[141:36.36]Okay.
[141:40.89]This has to be 30 or 40% by now.
[141:47.34]Oops.
[141:53.27]Watch that health.
[142:01.16]He's still alive?
[142:05.99]okay what does this say read in a second notice four engineers have gone missing since we started our expansion of the castle's plumbing system until we find out where they are we are shutting down construction please head through the cave and take the elevator back to the castle
[142:39.28]I thought that was a shop.
[142:51.02]I want to heal, but I don't.
[143:05.01]I get a lot of items though.
[143:06.97]I have so much money.
[143:21.46]Alright, that special move is... I'm so glad it's so good.
[143:27.48]Look at that.
[143:29.20]I can't even tell when it's happening.
[143:33.51]Alright, this looks kind of scary.
[143:37.11]Whatever.
[143:38.39]I don't want to die here.
[143:45.44]Well, it's a potion I don't have to use.
[143:50.26]What if I hit the barrel that she's sitting on?
[143:54.41]I wouldn't do that.
[143:55.17]I wouldn't do that to my queen.
[144:17.13]Increase the range.
[144:17.75]Enemies will be stunned.
[144:21.21]Because the ranged enemies are stunned and knock back enemies.
[144:24.09]I think I'm just going all in on this.
[144:33.89]He got so nervous to meet her, he shit his pants.
[144:40.10]For a second, I was trying to figure out what you were talking about.
[144:42.48]And now I know what you were doing.
[144:56.16]How, how, how?
[145:01.20]I just got so nervous.
[145:05.83]Oh, you're alive.
[145:22.01]Why did I buy that?
[145:23.01]They're awful.
[145:24.85]They are terrible.
[145:25.81]I don't even know why I bought it.
[145:26.91]Why did I buy it?
[145:28.57]I'm going to use it on one skeleton and it's going to be a waste of $200.
[145:38.22]This thing is crazy now.
[145:40.43]Hand cannon.
[145:47.14]This is like a rare.
[145:50.54]Can I do it?
[145:52.12]I'm doing it.
[145:54.85]Okay, very slow fire rate, very powerful, three bullets.
[146:03.94]So, only use that when it's absolutely necessary.
[146:10.61]Okay, here we go.
[146:17.64]Fuck you!
[146:18.52]It... That thing is crazy!
[146:31.05]I can't move.
[146:31.67]I'm stuck.
[146:32.09]I can't move.
[146:44.77]That was a disaster.
[146:46.09]I'm going to buy health.
[146:56.16]Juliet is watching, dude.
[146:57.45]Come on.
[146:59.62]Juliet, I slayed the demons.
[147:03.46]I'm here for some extra health points.
[147:06.86]Don't mind that I shit my pants before I came in here.
[147:09.12]Look at how cool I am now.
[147:18.57]This is a huge brown stain on my back.
[147:20.97]Yeah, I'm like, I slayed all those demons.
[147:24.34]I did it on my own.
[147:26.24]And I did it for your honor, Juliet, my queen.
[147:30.88]Huge brown shit stain.
[147:35.27]I don't even know.
[147:35.75]I thought that I took care of it.
[147:43.54]What was that?
[147:50.77]What was that?
[147:54.01]What was that?
[148:15.10]What was that?
[148:24.23]Ah, dude.
[148:24.83]You hit me, of all people.
[148:28.29]Uh-oh, this is a boss.
[148:30.30]Ah, boss coming up.
[148:31.58]There's only a wrench before a boss.
[148:35.02]Always.
[148:36.98]Always.
[148:39.09]Let me go back and get some more shit.
[148:42.05]No, don't do that!
[148:44.75]That's a bad angle.
[148:46.95]I don't like that angle.
[148:51.32]Very heavy damage to headshot.
[148:53.14]No, I'm keeping the hand cannon.
[148:55.16]Probably use it right now.
[148:56.89]Oh, fuck.
[148:57.35]I have to do it.
[148:58.37]I'm trapped in here.
[149:00.61]I'll do it for you, my queen.
[149:03.64]No, wait.
[149:03.90]Actually, which door is this going to open?
[149:19.04]I grind only the finest coffee beans for my queen.
[149:33.92]Vile creature!
[149:37.36]Just know that I shit my pants before I came in here.
[149:45.38]Let's have this be a fair fight.
[149:47.02]You shit your pants too.
[149:49.22]Oh fuck, it's dark.
[149:51.81]It's a spider.
[149:52.47]It's a spider.
[149:52.97]It's a spider.
[149:53.45]It's a spider.
[149:53.97]It's a spider.
[149:58.00]Oh fuck.
[149:58.94]Oh fuck.
[149:59.56]Oh my god, I hate this.
[150:01.50]Oh, I missed.
[150:05.45]Where is it?
[150:12.86]I'm not even hurting it.
[150:25.49]I'm gonna die.
[150:33.56]Okay, stay in, stay in, stay in.
[150:50.55]That's such a hard move to dodge.
[151:04.34]I can't see shit.
[151:15.33]Fuck!
[151:15.69]That move is so quick!
[151:26.85]Nooo!
[151:28.07]I'm running.
[151:32.91]No, please!
[151:36.36]Please!
[151:36.84]Please!
[151:47.09]Okay.
[151:57.19]one of those strikes, I could have done it.
[151:59.41]It's just the way he leans down.
[152:02.15]Like, he goes 1212.
[152:05.48]And then he crouches and goes, boom, really fast.
[152:09.02]He just you got to be ready for it.
[152:16.21]Okay.
[152:18.07]What if I do one really fast one?
[152:23.95]They the line?
[152:30.48]Is there a line?
[152:32.69]Sword only run.
[152:34.85]I think a sword only run.
[152:35.75]I'm just going to run to the boss.
[152:38.15]Let's try it.
[152:40.99]I got to go pee though.
[152:42.17]I'll be right back.
[152:43.98]Give me like five minutes.
[152:45.76]I want to take out auto too.
[152:47.60]So back in like five minutes.
[152:51.98]See you soon.
[152:53.26]I'm coming.
[152:53.96]Did you hear him?
[152:54.43]He's like, hey.
[152:56.29]I'm coming.
[152:56.71]Don't worry.
[152:59.67]My prince.
[153:02.17]Okay.
[153:03.18]I'll be right back.
[164:38.00]Okay, hello there.
[164:40.26]Sorry about that.
[164:44.76]Otto needs a little bit of extra help these days.
[164:46.65]He has some pretty bad arthritis in his forearms and his wrists.
[165:00.18]He's a little slower now.
[165:03.78]I have to kind of carry him around.
[165:09.28]But he's still happy.
[165:10.47]He's still having a good time.
[165:15.19]He can still walk around.
[165:15.95]He can still, he walks around to eat.
[165:18.12]He'll, you know, he can get up, he can go to the bathroom still.
[165:20.76]So he still has like total control of himself.
[165:23.97]But besides like walking to his food bowl or, you know, going to pee or poop, he's kind of like, yeah, I'm kind of done.
[165:33.65]So he is getting older.
[165:36.10]He's 15.
[165:37.16]He turns 16 next year.
[165:38.94]So he is, he's an old man, but he's doing alright.
[165:44.79]Just takes a little bit of extra help.
[165:50.92]Okay.
[165:52.20]Welcome back.
[165:55.22]The question now is I'm going to do a really fast one.
[165:58.64]And then however this plays out.
[166:01.22]I'm going to go to water park simulator.
[166:04.03]I didn't want to play that for a couple hours.
[166:06.69]So we'll do like one or two more of these.
[166:13.02]He's older than some chat members.
[166:14.54]That's actually kind of crazy to think about.
[166:17.10]If that's true.
[166:19.06]Okay, melee melee go.
[166:27.62]Alright.
[166:28.48]Not wasting any time.
[166:29.24]Just melee.
[166:29.88]Go.
[166:38.11]I do want at least like 500 coins.
[166:48.73]I miss Restaurant Empire.
[166:51.31]That's right.
[166:51.73]We could play that too.
[167:01.37]But I definitely want to play Waterpark Sim.
[167:03.01]It's been a while.
[167:04.61]Speed Bow.
[167:05.31]Each hit increases reload speed, damage, and movement speed.
[167:12.33]Well, if I hit somebody, we could see how it was.
[167:16.21]Cool.
[167:16.57]Alright.
[167:17.47]Maybe I should focus on that.
[167:18.56]No.
[167:19.34]Melee only.
[167:22.10]Melee only and carry buffs.
[167:25.47]That's all I want.
[167:34.87]Are you addicted to this?
[167:37.21]I'm addicted to winning.
[167:40.45]It's a drug I don't get very often.
[167:45.10]Ooh, that's good.
[168:00.19]I can't believe that you're a real person.
[168:02.73]Well, you're going to have to get over it, okay?
[168:05.11]You're going to have to get over it.
[168:10.19]And why is that, by the way?
[168:11.53]Why do you think that?
[168:13.78]Why do you think that?
[168:24.10]What is so unworldly about me playing a RPG roguelike game?
[168:31.19]I'm just sitting here.
[168:37.71]Stop sitting there.
[168:52.13]Fine, I'll stand up.
[168:56.24]Okay.
[168:57.16]Okay, now what?
[169:06.27]...
[169:08.34]I'm a normal guy, just like the rest of you.
[169:11.48]I wipe my boogers on a piece of paper like everybody else does, okay?
[169:29.21]One of the most intriguing and funny things about streaming...
[169:32.97]Or just, I don't know, making videos or content.
[169:34.82]Whatever.
[169:35.42]Content.
[169:36.08]Content creator.
[169:36.80]Whatever.
[169:37.32]Whatever you want to say.
[169:39.87]Is it making a reference to something that happened a week ago?
[169:43.67]Or a few days ago?
[169:45.33]So many of you here probably don't even know what that is.
[169:47.94]And I'm making a reference to something that you don't know.
[169:54.51]Okay.
[170:03.01]Oh, wait, somebody told me to do this.
[170:05.03]They weren't kidding.
[170:08.90]You're a performance artist.
[170:13.85]No, I'm- we're super fans.
[170:26.51]D'oh!
[170:29.81]I want to voice act for a game, but I only want to do that part.
[170:35.28]I don't want to be like... Hold on.
[170:40.34]I don't want to be like, how are we supposed to stop them?
[170:43.51]There's no way we'll get to the bottom.
[170:46.07]I want to be like...
[171:01.35]I wanna be the enemies.
[171:07.78]I'm gonna fuckin' dieeeeee!
[171:19.71]Like the Dark Souls 1 grunts?
[171:21.95]Uh-huh.
[171:30.07]That didn't count.
[171:45.03]That didn't count.
[171:55.40]That didn't count.
[171:56.84]Jerma, please, ain't no way.
[171:58.98]Ain't no way what?
[172:01.73]Can't hit me with an ain't no way, and I'd say, what way?
[172:05.63]Was ain't?
[172:23.29]Bleak as Keep is a challenging, roguelike RPG sword game.
[172:29.52]You play the title character, Bleak,
[172:33.49]To try to take over the castle in the kingdom of Edward.
[172:42.60]The combat's good.
[172:43.34]Fluid.
[172:44.10]Feels like a fun time.
[172:46.43]You collect coins on your mission to get to the top of that castle.
[172:50.81]And be on the lookout for gold items.
[172:53.18]This is cool.
[172:54.50]Fast fire rate.
[172:55.20]Large magazine.
[172:56.90]Headshot has a 20%...
[173:01.78]Uh, okay.
[173:03.03]Headshots make explosions.
[173:08.01]But watch out!
[173:09.30]Those skeletons don't want you to get to the top of that tower!
[173:17.97]Sorry.
[173:27.54]Nintendo Direct?
[173:28.52]Yeah.
[173:34.61]Was that Back to the Future?
[173:35.77]I think that- was that Back to the Future?
[173:37.53]I don't know.
[173:51.29]That was Kiss from a Rose?
[173:56.70]It was!
[174:01.33]Holy shit.
[174:03.19]I didn't even mean to do that.
[174:11.41]Wait a second, though.
[174:17.52]It's that Smash Brothers.
[174:23.60]What is that?
[174:30.13]Wait, I posted the... It's this in mod chat.
[174:37.03]Hold on.
[174:37.41]I can't listen to that unless I go on my phone.
[174:40.44]Back to the future theme?
[174:49.97]Okay, let me see.
[174:54.38]Does it actually sound like that?
[175:00.89]Let's find out.
[175:12.99]It does do that.
[175:40.90]Hold on a second.
[175:49.10]um
[176:06.67]Okay, I want that one.
[176:09.47]I want that one.
[176:11.76]I want... Oh, shit.
[176:17.06]I didn't buy a potion.
[176:19.57]Gotta be a gamer.
[176:22.47]That's alright.
[176:29.00]We're just, like, splanking today.
[176:49.82]Swing.
[176:51.00]Swing.
[176:51.90]Swing.
[176:52.64]Swing.
[176:52.94]I don't want to waste those bullets, but that's... How much coins am I getting for that?
[177:03.46]Decent amount?
[177:12.19]Not that I care.
[177:12.75]I'm doing melee.
[177:13.61]Okay.
[177:18.49]Uh... I'll try it.
[177:25.28]I've not tried any of these before.
[177:30.02]Oops.
[177:38.77]No, no, no, no, no!
[177:45.74]Oh, that was almost very bad.
[177:48.36]Is this game fun or is it gooner bait?
[177:53.08]I think the game is fun.
[177:54.85]And I think that you... What?
[178:01.52]A cool, fun game?
[178:02.92]Can't... Never mind.
[178:16.94]Say it with your chest!
[178:18.61]A boomerang!
[178:31.95]I actually like the boomerang better than anything else.
[178:35.26]Go ahead and call me a wanker all you want.
[178:37.20]I don't care.
[178:54.42]Bro, you're a wanker.
[178:57.13]That's alright.
[179:05.42]There's so many auto-mod.
[179:07.34]Uh, exploding rifle?
[179:09.14]Ho ho ho!
[179:13.33]Holly said, look at the blatant thumbnail farming.
[179:20.30]What?
[179:20.72]My thumb?
[179:21.32]Oh, my thumb.
[179:22.90]I'm taking the exploding rifle.
[179:29.40]We had a lot of newcomers because of that thumbnail.
[179:36.29]Really?
[179:37.93]Hold on.
[179:39.85]Oh my goodness, this thing is... This thing is... Don't!
[179:48.20]Don't!
[179:49.81]Don't!
[179:51.03]No, don't!
[179:53.17]Don't.
[179:56.65]Oh my god, she nailed that guy.
[180:03.91]How many do you... No!
[180:13.50]I have no health.
[180:15.47]I have to just... Oh fuck!
[180:23.54]Uh oh.
[180:26.36]I might have to just run.
[180:29.58]I don't like how spread out they are.
[180:35.45]I just hurt my tongue doing that.
[180:42.52]No, don't!
[180:57.96]If I get touched once, it's over and I really don't want to start over.
[181:13.29]I didn't have enough!
[181:18.17]Oh my god.
[181:19.09]Alright, please.
[181:19.97]As you're getting older, you start sounding more and more like a No More Heroes NPC getting mauled by Travis.
[181:35.21]What the... Are you prepared, huh?
[181:38.03]Are you prepared, huh?
[181:41.00]Yeah!
[181:41.57]Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[181:44.39]No, fucking goddammit!
[181:48.00]I wasn't paying attention!
[181:49.28]No more heroes is so good.
[182:09.67]You know, I know one just came out a couple years ago, right?
[182:14.17]But... I'm just skipping all content and just running to the boss.
[182:29.14]Sure, I'll take it.
[182:30.40]But I'll get a couple people.
[182:51.52]Dude, I could just kind of run them all here and then try to get them all in one swing.
[182:55.26]Let's try that.
[182:57.65]That's a strategy to do, for sure.
[182:59.37]Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da.
[183:26.26]Alright, let me see if I can get... Let's see if more viewers show up.
[184:00.64]There was a 1,000 viewer spike.
[184:23.47]Let's go!
[184:24.11]Wait a minute.
[184:26.11]Secret.
[184:50.38]Yep.
[184:54.19]Yep.
[184:56.27]Yep.
[184:59.76]Nope.
[185:01.50]Nope.
[185:04.81]Yep.
[185:06.45]Nope.
[185:08.18]Nope.
[185:09.94]Yep.
[185:11.58]Yep.
[185:23.51]The voice line, that's from, that's like a TikTok thing.
[185:29.22]It's the only, I know three memes from TikTok.
[185:32.59]That's one of them.
[185:37.78]Is this the fake jalapeño streamer?
[185:39.46]Shut the fuck up.
[185:51.28]I can't die right now.
[185:59.86]I can't die right now.
[186:01.32]I can't lose right now.
[186:10.73]That heal is such ass.
[186:11.94]It really is.
[186:15.58]But to answer your question, yes, that's me.
[186:23.67]How high are you?
[186:24.57]I'm not.
[186:25.19]I'm just having a silly day.
[186:29.46]Alright.
[186:29.72]Put in the title.
[186:31.00]Having a silly day.
[186:31.96]Don't ask.
[186:40.68]I don't even need that.
[186:46.31]Oh, my goodness.
[186:48.44]Oh, great.
[186:50.10]Okay, I have to leave.
[186:53.05]Wait, he's getting everybody.
[186:55.33]Actually amazing.
[186:57.59]And then we just deal with him and that's it?
[187:02.48]Oh, come on, dude.
[187:03.24]Don't do this right now.
[187:08.33]Stop.
[187:09.89]Ow, my stomach.
[187:15.72]Oh my god.
[187:20.52]Okay, I have no more... Oh, fuck me.
[187:26.81]Bad.
[187:29.51]Is there a potion in here?
[187:33.56]Okay, that's good, actually.
[187:39.49]No!
[187:42.86]I can't... What do I do?
[187:45.76]I need to think.
[188:07.15]That was so close.
[188:13.38]Was there a double update?
[188:17.26]Oh, is there a mod title fight right now?
[188:20.63]Uh oh.
[188:21.53]What was it?
[188:27.16]How is that even a shortcut?
[188:38.90]Splanking around for a few hours.
[188:39.95]Having a silly day, don't ask.
[188:42.97]Well, now it's a double title.
[188:46.88]It should read, having a silly day, don't ask.
[188:51.56]And don't even put it in parentheses.
[188:53.53]Say, having a silly day, comma, don't ask.
[189:03.26]How do you miss that?
[189:10.49]Alright, let's get this back on track here.
[189:17.94]Let's get this back on track.
[189:19.72]I need a good perk.
[189:20.78]Let's go with.
[189:24.55]Maybe this one.
[189:26.21]No.
[189:31.21]That one and then speed.
[189:37.82]Full health.
[189:39.18]My weapons fine.
[189:42.96]Alright, let's get up and fight that boss.
[189:44.36]I got that first boss clean.
[189:47.19]You know it.
[189:48.03]I want whatever's in this chest.
[190:01.17]Good.
[190:02.49]That's actually really good.
[190:13.66]I should have blocked it.
[190:16.08]That should have blocked.
[190:16.82]That should have blocked!
[190:19.64]I want a meeting with the developer!
[190:42.99]Karen.
[190:49.75]Oh, I didn't even see that.
[190:50.73]That's cool looking.
[190:56.53]I like the aesthetic of this game.
[190:57.77]It's really good.
[191:07.19]How did that miss?
[191:17.11]Oh, come on.
[191:17.85]Two of these guys.
[191:19.93]Can he just fall off the cliff?
[191:26.74]I don't want to fall off the cliff.
[191:35.11]Yeah, I'm not fighting him.
[191:39.21]Actually, I might have to.
[191:40.07]Yeah, I have to.
[191:41.00]There's too much shit over here.
[191:45.90]I'm not going to fight him.
[191:47.62]He'll kill these guys up here.
[191:59.77]Oh!
[192:05.36]Get out of the way!
[192:06.08]Get out of the way!
[192:06.76]Get out of the way!
[192:14.29]If I drink, I'm dead.
[192:16.27]Holy shit.
[192:17.25]Alright, I'm fine.
[192:19.23]Get me in, please!
[192:21.38]Okay.
[192:21.96]Thank God I get to see you and not him.
[192:27.26]How much health?
[192:38.36]I think that was all my money.
[192:40.26]It was worth it.
[192:42.04]I still have three heals.
[192:47.14]Is he right here?
[192:53.37]Okay.
[193:02.20]I just got an update.
[193:03.30]The Seaman Dreamcast auction is at $770 right now.
[193:13.51]Eh.
[193:14.79]Proceeds will be for the Monterey Bay Aquarium for DougDougStream.
[193:22.60]Oh, on DougDougStream.
[193:23.72]He's doing it right now.
[193:24.62]Or he's doing it over the next few days.
[193:26.33]What the fuck is he doing in there?
[193:29.05]What does he do?
[193:29.49]Wait, will they hurt each other?
[193:30.53]Hold on.
[193:33.09]Alright, come fight this guy.
[193:37.14]Come kick this guy's ass.
[193:43.87]Get him!
[193:46.68]Get him!
[193:52.55]It doesn't work.
[194:19.96]Oh my god, I think he did hurt him!
[194:23.19]Oh no!
[194:30.80]No!
[194:48.75]He's kicking shit at him
[195:10.59]No!
[195:11.55]I thought he was going to jump backwards.
[195:13.09]No!
[195:17.56]No!
[195:28.41]Why was he even in there?
[195:29.84]And why did I think I could make them hurt each other?
[195:32.58]I was fine.
[195:33.72]Hmm.
[195:40.68]Damn it.
[195:45.13]Dev's in chat.
[195:50.54]Hey, Jerma Dev here.
[195:51.24]Thanks so much for playing.
[195:52.24]Really surreal watching you play.
[195:54.14]Wanted to share some advice.
[195:56.11]Don't worry too much about blocking regular zombies unless swarmed.
[195:58.99]Reload, upgrade, reloads your bow faster too.
[196:03.36]Stockpile and lucky hit upgrades are key.
[196:06.10]And you may like the attack's face.
[196:09.60]And you may like the attack's face camera option.
[196:12.26]Yes, hello.
[196:12.75]This is your developer meeting.
[196:13.91]LOL.
[196:14.31]Said that a while I was typing.
[196:18.01]Yes, real dev.
[196:18.83]Hello.
[196:19.25]Unironically caused FPS problems.
[196:21.13]Laughing my ass off.
[196:23.91]What did I do?
[196:30.16]Well, what's up?
[196:31.72]Your game is fun.
[196:32.60]I like it.
[196:37.01]Okay, what if I do this?
[196:47.69]Here we go.
[196:48.55]I'll show you how I do it here.
[196:55.76]I'll show you how we do it here.
[197:10.76]Hello.
[197:33.53]Away from me.
[197:43.07]Get away from me!
[197:46.36]Alright, now we get an item?
[197:47.26]Uh oh.
[197:53.61]Fuck you!
[198:03.90]I feel like they spawned more enemies!
[198:24.18]Okay, now we fight.
[198:55.89]There we go.
[198:56.45]Alright, we're good.
[198:58.67]Okay.
[198:59.67]Now, let me get this guy too.
[199:13.51]I want the money.
[199:14.91]I've got 800 coins.
[199:27.83]That's how we do it.
[199:29.49]Boomerang.
[199:30.66]Perfect.
[199:32.78]Actually perfect.
[199:42.57]I'm ready to fight.
[199:44.22]I want three potions.
[199:47.18]Which should be enough to get me there, right?
[199:49.75]One, two... Okay, that's good.
[199:53.23]I don't need anything but my sword and my shield and my axe and my bow and my knowledge and my intelligence and my magical wizard powers and my ring and my stew and my breakfast and my second breakfast, Pippin!
[200:52.48]Alright.
[201:21.99]Get out of town.
[201:26.94]Oh, I got an achievement.
[201:27.62]Defeat the King Edgar within five minutes of starting a run.
[201:31.08]Ooh.
[201:33.02]Okay.
[201:37.24]Now I got to figure out how to kill that spider.
[201:47.81]I kind of locked in there.
[201:48.79]Yeah.
[201:49.66]I mean, once you get the pattern, it's not...
[201:52.50]It really isn't like three or four really different.
[201:56.37]You got like the one, two.
[201:57.47]You have the dash.
[201:58.21]You get the gun is the one that throws you off the most.
[201:59.91]OK.
[202:12.25]It's probably this.
[202:18.57]Alright, here we go.
[202:19.15]Back into the sewer.
[202:20.14]I've got two potions.
[202:21.10]I don't have any perks or anything.
[202:24.92]That's the one downside of this.
[202:25.98]I'm kind of underleveled.
[202:28.07]Or undergeared or whatever you want to call it.
[202:29.89]So I have to focus now on getting money.
[202:38.98]Someone's in a hurry.
[202:41.38]Keep it up.
[202:48.36]I'll do anything for you.
[203:00.61]Uh oh.
[203:03.35]I don't like that you're behind me.
[203:06.60]I thought I blocked it.
[203:07.44]Shit!
[203:11.46]Fuck!
[203:12.16]That extra half second is killing me!
[203:15.31]No!
[203:15.77]Please not right here!
[203:16.73]This is such a shitty roll.
[203:20.34]Where are you, dead?
[203:30.83]Is there an ogre in here too?
[203:37.80]I need more melee damage.
[203:40.76]And you gotta get right in on the spider and he's got that move.
[203:47.53]Hello.
[203:49.09]Okay.
[203:49.35]Okay.
[203:54.09]What is important for that spider?
[204:06.78]That's probably one of the... I think it's one of the blocks.
[204:09.01]Because... I parry so much.
[204:16.86]But maybe it's this.
[204:20.33]Is the range an issue though for the spider?
[204:22.75]I don't know.
[204:23.53]I don't think so.
[204:29.64]I need a better weapon.
[204:32.22]How many parts do I have?
[204:33.61]None.
[204:44.96]Everyone's asking the dev about Juliet.
[204:48.81]They have a lot of questions.
[205:04.59]Regain Dodge.
[205:06.23]I guess that's kind of good.
[205:08.95]Reload.
[205:09.50]I think I'm going to do that.
[205:11.00]I need a good weapon though.
[205:15.16]I need something great for the spider.
[205:18.09]Something truly great.
[205:23.99]Okay, I'm confident that I'll get at least back there.
[205:28.02]Hello.
[205:28.32]Hello.
[205:46.59]Excuse me.
[205:51.44]Okay.
[205:51.56]How much is he worth?
[205:55.26]600 coins.
[205:57.12]Wait a minute.
[206:03.47]I think it's that and that.
[206:08.39]I'm probably going to get the speed a few times.
[206:12.54]Look at how much faster I am.
[206:13.38]Just one or two points in it.
[206:24.10]Why is the boomerang not broken?
[206:28.73]Is it actually broken and it's doing less damage?
[206:30.83]Or do I have a sick glitch here?
[206:39.40]Oh, fuck off.
[206:51.52]Where's my thing?
[206:55.22]Where's my thing?
[207:07.50]Okay.
[207:07.62]This level's not long, so I have to be prepared for it.
[207:14.57]Maybe it is the bow.
[207:15.73]Should I just avoid the spider?
[207:18.46]No.
[207:18.74]The spider has so much stuff that closes gaps.
[207:26.24]I think I'm just gonna have to parry and get in there.
[207:29.60]Unless I find something crazy.
[207:32.67]There's a legendary item in the shop.
[207:38.61]Go back to the shop.
[207:42.34]What do you mean?
[207:44.82]I can't go back.
[207:45.92]Go back, please?
[207:46.65]What are you talking about?
[207:47.99]Oh, they're lying.
[207:49.17]Oh, okay.
[207:50.19]Guys, you will see Juliet again.
[207:52.03]Don't worry.
[207:53.93]I promise.
[208:03.94]Oh my freaking god.
[208:05.58]I feel like I'm not doing enough damage from melee.
[208:31.88]I need more money.
[208:33.74]Bad.
[208:34.15]Rawr!
[209:01.31]Okay.
[209:02.35]Keep going.
[209:08.21]Can you do a no swear stream?
[209:09.85]Uh, yeah.
[209:10.21]Starting right now.
[209:17.21]Well, I ain't moving until everybody's picked off here.
[209:36.77]I feel like I'm shooting at them in a nightmare.
[209:38.83]Like, no, no, they're far away, but I can't, I can't hit them.
[209:41.12]They're getting closer.
[209:41.89]They're getting closer, but I still have plenty of arrows, but they're close.
[209:44.50]They're right in my face now.
[210:13.42]Shit!
[210:14.08]It's happening again.
[210:14.76]I'm in my nightmare again.
[210:22.55]Oh no!
[210:25.27]This guy doesn't have any arms.
[210:26.16]He's freaking me out.
[210:50.41]Okay.
[210:58.10]Four healing potions.
[210:59.04]Come on.
[210:59.64]This is the one right here.
[211:00.78]I need a better weapon though.
[211:02.36]Something better than this.
[211:05.90]Something a little bit more destructive.
[211:12.57]Something that has a big like a shotgun or something.
[211:26.25]I mean, that's... That's okay.
[211:30.66]I wouldn't say that's ideal, but it's alright.
[211:32.42]Oh, hold on.
[211:34.62]I just get it if I knock them down, right?
[211:49.07]How many coins do I get for knocking something down?
[211:51.87]I didn't even see them.
[211:57.47]That's six coins.
[212:00.59]That's not worth it.
[212:01.14]I should get one more shop, which would be huge.
[212:20.12]That's it, right?
[212:21.12]Where are the secrets?
[212:28.45]That's good.
[212:29.43]I need way more ammo than this.
[212:43.62]That's better.
[212:45.80]Not ideal.
[212:57.60]He's still alive.
[213:12.85]Okay.
[213:13.95]20 bullets.
[213:15.29]20 or so.
[213:15.87]19.
[213:25.44]I'm back.
[213:27.89]okay dev said lucky weapons should be we prioritize predictile and bullet weapon accuracy
[213:58.95]I don't know.
[213:59.55]I don't know what to do.
[214:19.77]Maybe, maybe more speed.
[214:34.41]And that.
[214:35.15]And this.
[214:37.21]Okay, here we go.
[214:38.83]Look at how fast I am now.
[214:41.84]It's like I have a speed potion on.
[214:44.18]Okay, I've got bullets.
[214:45.51]I'm not going to rely on it though.
[214:46.65]I'm just going to be very careful and very cautious.
[214:49.65]You are here.
[214:52.86]I would love a better weapon.
[214:55.58]I mean, I'm going to use it and it's going to be stupid.
[214:59.49]But I'll use it on the ogre.
[215:04.58]That didn't do anything.
[215:21.12]Fuck!
[215:29.68]That didn't actually take too much damage.
[215:33.88]Okay, I can go back.
[215:36.66]No, there's another shop right here.
[215:48.16]Any other bad enemies over there?
[215:49.32]I don't think so.
[215:54.83]No gargoyles and no trolls, no witch ladies.
[216:09.08]You piece of shit.
[216:18.74]Look at how many healing potions I have now.
[216:20.18]This is guaranteed.
[216:24.95]You fucker.
[216:48.95]OK, I have so much health.
[216:58.34]I just have so much money.
[217:00.83]So.
[217:02.83]Let's not ruin this.
[217:21.28]I got to get that second move the spider does.
[217:25.49]Once the timing is down, it's good to go.
[217:28.75]You've got to be kidding me.
[217:29.90]I can't blow this up.
[217:32.20]Alright.
[217:33.00]I can't lose now, right?
[217:34.78]Don't be overconfident.
[217:38.15]I could eat all these.
[217:39.13]I might not even have a chance to drink one.
[217:40.89]Try not to drink one potion.
[217:42.63]That's the goal.
[218:08.28]Oh my god!
[218:29.06]Woohoo!
[218:31.22]Burn all your ammo?
[218:33.03]I don't even care about the ammo.
[218:34.83]Because the spider is definitely a melee fight.
[218:37.11]At least for me.
[218:39.99]alright is this it I don't get another uh time out with my goth queen why not okay should I drink no we're not quite there yet
[219:23.88]I don't get another timeout.
[219:28.73]I don't think so, at least.
[219:37.33]I actually think I want... I want this.
[219:55.39]I need to heal.
[220:03.08]Give me one more healing potion.
[220:05.68]Or give me another shop.
[220:06.58]I have 3,000 gold.
[220:08.40]Can I just run back?
[220:12.43]I might just run back and see if I can go back in the store.
[220:18.04]I should be able to.
[220:32.66]It closed behind me.
[220:39.45]That's alright.
[220:44.94]Okay, well.
[220:49.27]Alright.
[220:56.10]Frying pan or shotgun?
[220:58.63]I'm going to stay with the pan.
[221:07.38]Alright, I'm gonna blink.
[221:08.74]I'm gonna drink some water.
[221:18.21]I drank that too fast.
[221:22.44]I have to make sure I'm comfortable.
[221:26.94]I don't like how my headphone is sitting right here.
[221:29.29]I don't like it.
[221:29.71]It's weird.
[221:32.96]Alright, here we go.
[221:34.34]Hair's out of my face.
[221:35.78]I'm walking in.
[221:36.40]I'm not saying a gosh darn word.
[221:38.35]Here we go.
[222:12.72]Oh my god!
[223:59.84]Bye.
[224:32.74]Okay.
[225:34.95]Yeah!
[225:37.23]That got a little hairy at the end.
[225:43.02]That got a little scary at the end.
[225:45.06]I am not going to lie.
[225:46.78]Okay.
[225:49.61]That wasn't that bad.
[225:50.41]That wasn't that bad.
[225:51.07]It's just about the double tap.
[225:56.48]That was anticlimactic.
[225:57.82]I'm going for the wind, man.
[225:58.98]I'm not going for the music behind me.
[226:02.33]I'm taking the win.
[226:03.17]You take the W. Yeah, we didn't have an epic battle at the end.
[226:06.44]I shot him with an arrow, okay?
[226:08.52]I'm taking the W. Cowabunga, dude.
[226:24.92]Yeah.
[226:27.60]I think that's everything.
[226:40.61]I'll take that.
[226:42.45]I want to make a legendary weapon.
[226:46.57]Let's go.
[226:51.90]You're halfway there.
[226:56.04]Nice job.
[226:58.75]Although it's probably going to get harder now.
[227:03.89]So hang in there.
[227:13.02]Somebody said, why is she 10 feet tall?
[227:16.21]Why don't you mine your own beeswax?
[227:25.72]Okay.
[227:32.55]This is a crazy looking area.
[227:45.96]That's a different ogre.
[227:47.47]Oh, that's a werewolf.
[227:53.65]Oh, shit.
[227:54.02]These guys are actually kind of crazy.
[227:57.44]I have no... Okay, hold on.
[228:11.38]Holy shit, those guys are rough.
[228:15.71]Skeletons?
[228:17.44]They throw bones.
[228:21.10]Don't tell me they come back to life, right?
[228:22.74]They're not going to do the Mario thing?
[228:40.95]Ooh, perfect timing for that.
[228:43.31]I'm going to take a no.
[228:46.60]Who's this guy?
[228:51.82]Cormac was a trusted advisor and protector of King Edgar.
[228:56.01]Using his magic, he kept the kingdom safe from countless troubles.
[228:58.98]Despite being one of King Edgar's oldest allies, he did not stop Cormac from betraying him.
[229:04.71]With the king gone, Cormac now rules over the land.
[229:09.98]What a scumbag.
[229:14.22]He was the statue, and that's the secret ending.
[229:27.26]I hear bells.
[229:37.71]God, it's another werewolf.
[229:39.01]Okay.
[229:42.72]Wait, I thought that... No, it's just a regular man.
[229:45.45]It's just a man!
[229:46.59]It's just a man.
[229:58.78]I got $5,000.
[230:19.96]Alright, what am I going to do with all this money?
[230:25.73]Let's see.
[230:33.36]That looks weirdly placed.
[230:34.30]Why is that here like this?
[230:38.71]Hey, what's up?
[230:53.90]I need healing.
[231:01.95]I need one more weapon part and I can do it.
[231:10.12]Okay, so there's a 40% chance.
[231:13.53]I have a 30% chance right now that somebody will drop ammo when I hit them.
[231:19.46]That's kind of awesome.
[231:20.46]So let's hope I can do it.
[231:28.68]Looks good.
[231:29.30]Let's go.
[231:34.03]Interesting.
[231:38.33]That's not going to stab me, right?
[231:42.98]Oh.
[231:52.35]I ain't getting out of that one.
[232:02.09]Let's make this a little easier.
[232:13.77]Okay.
[232:18.08]The most watched timeline is going to be embarrassing, guys.
[232:23.69]You mean the part where the spider almost gets me and I go, whoa!
[232:26.53]Whoa!
[232:37.66]What the hell was that?
[232:46.88]Okay.
[232:48.20]I need... I have enough weapons to make a heavy weapon.
[232:54.13]If I could just aim well.
[232:56.53]Alright, there's a new enemy right there.
[233:00.00]Oh, shit.
[233:02.58]Hold on, don't freak out.
[233:04.79]Get him up, line him up, line him up.
[233:24.16]Oh shit.
[233:25.46]Uh oh.
[233:31.66]I have one shot.
[233:33.73]He'll kill everybody.
[233:43.68]Alright, will you just turn around and whack those people?
[233:48.42]Oh, shit in my pants.
[233:50.14]I gotta go.
[233:51.42]Get out of there!
[233:52.09]Dodge!
[233:53.03]Dodge!
[233:56.23]I have to drink a potion right now!
[233:58.75]Oh!
[234:05.52]Oh my god!
[234:06.20]Get me on the stairs!
[234:07.52]Fuck you!
[234:10.93]Horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible.
[234:17.15]Horrible!
[234:36.60]Die!
[234:42.81]Holy shit.
[234:52.38]I'm just taking the speed potion.
[234:53.74]Fuck it.
[234:59.71]I want the ammo.
[235:05.29]Okay, I got a lot of ammo now.
[235:07.91]Just don't waste it.
[235:10.45]Healing revolver?
[235:16.64]Headshots heal one point of damage.
[235:19.32]That's actually kind of awesome.
[235:20.40]Alright.
[235:23.27]Did I get this?
[235:25.25]I did.
[235:26.81]How much HP do I have?
[235:36.17]I probably should not have just thrown that carbine away.
[235:41.76]Unfortunately.
[235:44.52]But it's a new item and I wanted to see it.
[235:47.05]So it is what it is.
[236:00.21]Who is that?
[236:01.45]Who is that?
[236:01.79]What is that?
[236:03.01]Who is that?
[236:06.66]Is that a person?
[236:08.63]Is that a decoration?
[236:40.60]I'm looking for ammo.
[236:47.34]Oh my god, that guy's got a double chainsaw hand!
[236:56.71]Oh no, they're guns.
[237:01.70]The timing is weird!
[237:06.58]Holy shit.
[237:22.24]Thank goodness.
[237:29.57]Stop.
[237:30.13]You always call them people or a person.
[237:31.98]It doesn't matter what kills you.
[237:33.20]I don't know.
[237:33.58]It's like an entity.
[237:39.57]This healing revolver is almost broken.
[237:41.37]Which is infuriating.
[237:46.07]Holy smokes.
[237:47.69]I could fall.
[238:04.48]I wanna see around the corner!
[238:05.97]Don't you dare, dude.
[238:15.49]A bloody revolver?
[238:21.16]Deals more damage when switching between targets.
[238:25.59]Okay, so I have to shoot... What the fuck happened to me?
[238:30.64]What happened?
[238:33.34]No!
[238:33.87]What?
[238:36.17]Did I shoot myself in the... Did I shoot myself?
[238:38.89]What happened to me?
[238:44.94]I don't... Oh, that sucks.
[238:46.54]What even killed me?
[238:47.52]I was reading a tooltip.
[238:56.14]Alright, I think that's it for now.
[238:58.48]This game's really fun though, I like it a lot.
[239:01.73]I apparently was halfway to the end of the game.
[239:15.84]And the game is nine dollars.
[239:21.60]So we'll switch to water park simulator in just a second.
[239:27.39]Just a minute.
[239:32.40]Is there any meta progression or is it a new run every time?
[239:35.92]I think I think it's just a new run every time.
[239:39.35]I think you just got to get it all done.
[239:47.35]Which is fine.
[239:48.07]I like a lot of progression, but... What that ultimately means is the game... Doesn't have to make itself... Too... Potentially arbitrarily too hard... To get through in one go.
[240:03.60]So, you just have to play the game good.
[240:10.73]I am a sucker for...
[240:12.97]You know, you get to the end screen, it's like, ooh, your heart coins or your skull coins or something.
[240:19.92]You earned three.
[240:20.84]You can spend that on a 5% health permanent upgrade.
[240:23.86]I'm a sucker for that stuff, but it doesn't have to be in the game.
[240:29.99]Okay.
[240:36.15]And it does have a counter, a speedrun counter.
[240:38.00]That's fun.
[240:41.20]And I want to show you this too, because I looked at this very briefly.
[240:44.34]This is cool, because there's actually a lot of weapons in the game.
[240:57.30]Do I have any new outfits?
[241:01.38]Okay, spend $200,000, you get this.
[241:04.93]I ain't beaten Cormac 10 times.
[241:12.77]Complete a run with an A rank.
[241:14.60]Oh man.
[241:18.22]Take a look at this.
[241:19.60]There's a lot of weapons.
[241:21.94]There's kind of a shitload of different things you can do.
[241:27.75]Bomb launcher.
[241:35.86]Rocket launcher.
[241:38.98]So I guess the game dials up and gets a little crazy.
[241:45.01]But there seems to be a lot of interesting things.
[241:51.89]I think this is my favorite weapon.
[241:53.40]I only saw it once, though.
[242:02.33]What else is here?
[242:07.13]I don't even think I saw the standard crossbow.
[242:13.98]Can you rocket jump?
[242:17.78]What is this thing plasma weapon?
[242:32.10]Oh, you can do perks.
[242:34.05]Even million dollars to do perks.
[242:41.86]This is really crazy.
[242:45.72]Lever action, heavy damage, very accurate, fast fire.
[242:53.55]Oh my goodness.
[243:04.08]You can do some damage with that.
[243:06.20]Golden gun.
[243:08.86]Oh, it's this one.
[243:12.33]I like the pan.
[243:13.03]The pan was fun.
[243:16.20]What is this green one?
[243:17.56]Powerful revolver.
[243:20.26]Piercing shot.
[243:21.79]Slow reload.
[243:26.00]This thing has drop on it.
[243:27.66]Look at this.
[243:31.06]Am I crazy?
[243:44.94]but it's fun oh wait there is a flamethrower somebody was saying this should be a flamethrower for the spider it's more of a flame shot than it is a flamethrower that's been cool to find longbow yeah I never understood how this one worked
[244:14.28]Oh, I had zero.
[244:15.24]That's why it didn't work last time.
[244:17.74]Look at how much drop there is.
[244:18.59]If you do that really close.
[244:21.01]This is like almost a melee weapon.
[244:25.01]How far can you get?
[244:26.65]I guess if you angle it enough, you can do it.
[244:30.18]Look at that.
[244:30.60]Oh my god, that arc is crazy.
[244:36.76]I actually like the musket.
[244:38.21]I thought it was fun.
[244:40.53]I was too afraid to use it.
[244:48.55]Lock potion cool.
[244:51.54]Hey, the streets are saying you should play the restaurant game.
[244:57.43]That's that's alright.
[245:01.18]You can test it all out and stuff.
[245:02.40]That's cool.
[245:12.35]Alright, I'm gonna move to water park sim.
[245:17.11]Give me two seconds.
[245:18.09]I'm not going anywhere, I'm just gonna sit here.
[245:22.88]See how far, I was in water park sim.
