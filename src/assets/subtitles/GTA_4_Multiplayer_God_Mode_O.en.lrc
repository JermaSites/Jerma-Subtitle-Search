[00:01.17]No!
[00:16.10]No, not again!
[00:17.60]Not again!
[00:21.88]I'm gonna crash my stream.
[00:23.22]Oh my god, I'm gonna crash my stream.
[00:26.60]I'm gonna crash.
[00:27.30]Everything's gonna crash.
[00:29.22]Oh my god, what have I done?
[00:31.23]I just turned around.
[00:32.13]Get on the bike.
[00:32.67]Get on the bike.
[00:33.27]And there's a line of these trucks.
[00:34.11]Get me out of here.
[00:35.07]Get me out of here before, like, everything just crashes.
[00:37.07]Get on.
[00:37.91]Quick, get us out of here, quick.
[00:40.71]Get us out of here.
[00:43.91]Away he goes.
[00:45.55]I gotta get on the highway.
[00:47.25]There's too many people on this road at this time of day.
[00:52.13]She's gonna go over here.
[00:52.91]That's just a typical day in the world.
[00:57.18]Things like that happen every day.
[01:00.16]Okay, there it is.
[01:01.28]Here's the farmer's market up here.
[01:03.92]I know it's right next to the airport.
[01:07.82]There it is.
[01:08.64]There's the farmer's market.
[01:12.00]Let me get...
[01:25.60]That didn't make any sense.
[01:31.28]That didn't make any sense.
[01:32.73]Why?
[01:34.95]Why would that happen?
[01:36.95]Grandpa's dead.
[01:38.07]You just killed Grandpa.
[01:40.11]I'm so sorry.
[01:41.41]He just wanted to go to the farmer's market and get, like, some bread.
[01:44.07]No.
[01:44.47]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:47.16]No, don't.
[01:48.12]Oh, my God.
[01:50.48]Oh, my God.

[01:57.91]My computer.
[01:59.93]I can't.
[02:00.31]I have to get away.
[02:01.01]Alright, Talos, get in.
[02:06.38]You... It's alright.
[02:07.98]Don't worry.
[02:08.66]We're fine.
[02:09.04]Get in.
[02:12.70]It's all good.
[02:13.26]We're fine.
[02:13.92]Hang on, I don't think it let's me anymore.
[02:15.94]Pay no attention to like the beeps that you have.
[02:18.30]Like, oh, it's okay.
[02:19.52]I just have like all this like these explode.
[02:22.04]Hey, I'm fine.
[02:22.68]You just killed yourself.
[02:25.92]I have god mode.
[02:28.20]Spawn me a helicopter.
[02:30.70]You are so bad with... Ugh.
[02:37.13]Alright, here you go, Etalyx.
[02:39.57]Great, thanks.
[02:40.43]Did I just seriously land that on somebody's head?
[02:42.25]I think you landed it on yourself.
[02:44.59]Are we having a dog fight?
[02:47.25]You can't do that in helicopters, I don't think.
[02:49.08]Maybe you can?
[02:52.44]What just flew in the air?
[02:53.66]I can't believe my blades didn't break.
[02:55.98]Alright, you get in the air so you're safe.
[02:58.84]It takes me a little longer than the average person to get going.
[03:01.14]Alright, go get...
[03:04.57]What did you do?
[03:05.35]I gave him a helicopter and everything.
[03:06.97]I saw him being all nice and taking off, and I was like, no.
[03:13.27]Now this has got to stop.
[03:14.97]Yeah, Italic, this is yours.
[03:16.81]I'll make sure it's, like, fresh for you.
[03:18.85]Yeah, the door's open.
[03:20.61]Can you get in there?
[03:21.29]Oh, have we, like, got to the sell-by date yet at the grocery store?
[03:25.03]Is it still fresh?
[03:26.43]Guns.
[03:27.13]Gun battle.
[03:28.37]Oh, good thing you two are duking it out first.
[03:30.27]With your super speed.
[03:32.19]Hey, I had to get out of there.
[03:37.84]No, I can't see.
[03:40.10]Oh, baby.
[03:41.18]Good shot.
[03:42.26]Get beasted on.
[03:43.84]Oh, keyboard mouse control is the worst.
[03:45.65]Haha, I cheated.
[03:51.47]Oh my god.
[03:54.33]Gerber, you have that sniper rifle, right?
[03:56.03]Alright, I have a bunch of old guys.
[04:00.40]I have a huge group of sophisticated old men.
[04:04.42]I think this is my cue.
[04:21.08]Well, I think you've crashed it officially on your end.
[04:24.20]Yep.
[04:24.38]One of those.
[04:24.72]Alright, guys.
[04:26.18]Hope you're ready for this.
[04:27.26]Because this is completely outrageous.
[04:29.60]You're going to crash the server again?
[04:31.38]I don't know.
[04:31.76]We'll see.
[04:33.08]Ladies and gentlemen, if the server crashes and the game crashes, I'll see you all next time.
[04:43.29]I'm 100 feet in the air.
[04:44.79]Oh, he's tail spinning.
[04:47.53]Oh, it's jump rope.
[04:48.27]It's jump rope.
[04:49.79]I always have to point out that this is without hacks.
[04:53.51]Dude, those people have got sent into outer space.
[05:00.61]Jeez.
[05:03.41]Oh, I can't believe I actually landed that shot.
[05:07.27]I feel like I just won the game.
[05:11.26]You won the game, huh?
[05:12.10]Get in.
[05:13.58]No, that's not gonna work.
[05:16.10]It's not gonna work.
[05:17.36]He's just gonna blow himself up.
[05:18.96]Hey, I'm fine.
[05:20.46]I just figured you could use a new car alarm.
[05:22.38]Beep, beep, beep.
[05:24.54]I just installed your new car alarm.
[05:28.73]I didn't do that.
[05:30.93]I think you rolled onto the explosive.
[05:34.55]And it exploded.
[05:37.19]Uh...
[06:02.20]you
