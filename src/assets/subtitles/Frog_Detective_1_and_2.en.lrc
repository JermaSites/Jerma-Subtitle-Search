[00:01.63]Hello.
[00:03.15]Good afternoon, everybody.
[00:04.39]How you doing?
[00:11.15]Good to see you again.
[00:12.02]It's always good to see you.
[00:14.50]What's up?
[00:19.02]Today, we're going to play a game that's been highly, highly recommended to me in the Discord channel and here.
[00:27.94]I don't know why.
[00:28.48]The game's called Frog Detective.
[00:33.53]And I mean, Frog is in the title, so I have to play it.
[00:37.87]I got this thing going since like 2012.
[00:42.28]For every single video game with Frog in the title, I have to play it at some point.
[00:46.98]So that's what we're doing today.
[00:48.14]Does it have candy in it?
[00:50.76]I don't know.
[00:53.12]This game's only like an hour long.
[00:55.74]So...
[00:58.17]The other plan is, once we get through Frog Detective, is we're going to do Part 2 of Community Content Night.
[01:06.10]Remember I told you we were going to split it into two, and we're going to do it next weekend, and here we are.
[01:15.30]Community Content Night Part 2 will be after Frog Detective 1.
[01:25.44]Let's go over... Those of you that weren't here a couple days ago, we talked about the schedule coming up here.
[01:30.51]It's going to get a little weird.
[01:32.35]I have some old friends that have come into town.
[01:41.21]And they are going to be here for a week.
[01:43.35]A full week.
[01:46.46]So, I've got to take some time to show them around Vegas.
[01:50.78]Some of them, it's their first time ever being here, so... Old Boston friends coming in.
[01:57.19]On top of that, I have sort of the final stretch of my medical mystery.
[02:06.93]There's a couple appointments coming up this week.
[02:09.35]Well, next week is what I mean.
[02:12.51]So, it's gonna be interesting.
[02:15.54]Well, not next week.
[02:16.58]Like, the week after next.
[02:18.42]The first week of February.
[02:21.14]So, there's not gonna be a stream tomorrow.
[02:26.12]That's where it starts.
[02:27.32]But, as of Tuesday, we're going to start early on Tuesday.
[02:32.38]Very early.
[02:33.00]Because I've got something going on later in the evening on Tuesday.
[02:38.23]But as of Tuesday, we're going to go five days in a row.
[02:42.13]We're going to go Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday.
[02:46.37]And then after that, after the five-day super stream...
[02:51.19]You are not gonna see me for at least six days That's what I'm gonna be taking the week off.
[02:55.35]So I figured if I'm gonna take six days off I want to stream like six days in a week.
[03:01.01]You know I'm saying I Don't want to disappear But that's the plan nothing tomorrow something today, and then we do five days in a row He's never coming back after that one What am I gonna do for six days I Don't know knit a sweater
[03:21.58]He would not tie in class.
[03:26.09]Go work on something cool.
[03:29.39]Eat a good breakfast at least one of those days.
[03:32.83]I want you to, okay, when the time, when I'm gone, I want you to eat a fucking really good breakfast.
[03:37.47]I'm talking like greens, tomatoes, beans and shit.
[03:42.43]Like have like a full good spread and think about me while you're doing that.
[03:46.80]Be like, he fucking told me to do this shit.
[03:49.70]He told me to have like beans and tomatoes and some nice like green sauteed eggs.
[03:55.16]I want you to think of me when you do that.
[03:58.10]What do you mean?
[03:58.94]What?
[03:59.40]Ew.
[04:01.22]Beans for breakfast?
[04:04.26]Hold on a minute.
[04:05.66]What?
[04:05.90]You guys don't... What do you mean?
[04:07.78]Beans for breakfast?
[04:08.74]What the fuck?
[04:09.24]What's wrong with you?
[04:09.78]What are you talking about?
[04:15.79]That's English.
[04:16.29]That's English style.
[04:17.31]You guys don't have English style breakfast in England?
[04:20.89]Like 12% of my audience is from England.
[04:23.35]How come I'm not seeing more yeses?
[04:32.48]England isn't real.
[04:35.30]That's an English-style breakfast.
[04:36.40]Beans, toast, eggs, tomatoes, sausages.
[04:41.51]Come on, that's an English-style breakfast.
[04:43.15]That's what my mother used to tell me.
[04:45.19]Was she lying to me?
[04:46.61]No, she wasn't.
[04:49.97]Kim says that too.
[04:50.95]I got two people versus you of like 3,000.
[04:52.45]Sorry, guys.
[04:56.76]Anyways, we're going to play Frog.
[04:57.74]Just going to chill for a little bit.
[04:58.74]Play Frog Detective.
[04:59.62]This has been very, very highly requested.
[05:01.10]I don't know why, but it was.
[05:04.51]It's true.
[05:04.97]Yeah, I know.
[05:05.57]Let's put it on.
[05:10.02]I don't know anything about this game.
[05:11.56]It just looks kind of like a cute detective game.
[05:14.54]Okay, all the Drew crew that's here.
[05:16.34]Just imagine... Nancy Drew's a frog now, okay?
[05:18.70]Can you see it?
[05:25.76]There you go.
[05:31.28]Why does every game have to have a crew?
[05:34.60]Why can't we just play video games?
[05:37.24]Why is it, why is my stream, in my community, every game is a different country?
[05:44.95]Why can't we just have, why do I have to have a crew for every game?
[05:47.67]Is this game fun?
[05:53.15]I already know, okay.
[05:57.29]Alright, let's see.
[05:57.81]Do it.
[05:58.61]Yeah, I know it's gonna get spammed.
[05:59.77]Do it.
[06:04.67]Use the mouse to look around.
[06:05.81]Alright, super frog detective.
[06:09.29]WASD is moving around, okay.
[06:13.44]It's me!
[06:17.84]The phone's ringing.
[06:20.56]Is this not even fucking 90 FOV?
[06:22.97]Fucking refunded.
[06:27.45]Hello.
[06:28.21]Who is it?
[06:30.40]It's the supervisor.
[06:32.14]Hi, supervisor.
[06:33.72]Hey, how's life?
[06:35.38]Yeah, pretty good, I reckon.
[06:36.28]How are things with you?
[06:38.54]Me and the wife just got back from Indonesia.
[06:42.08]Oh, well, salamat datang kembali.
[06:45.52]That means welcome back, I think.
[06:47.82]Thanks.
[06:49.44]Anyway, what are you calling about?
[06:50.70]Oh, right, right.
[06:52.66]I have a case for you.
[06:54.30]Who?
[06:55.32]It's a pretty spooky one, so hold on tight.
[06:58.46]I'm holding on.
[07:00.27]There's a little sloth who owns an island just off the bay.
[07:03.49]Martin's his name.
[07:05.05]Says he's been hearing of ghosts for about two weeks.
[07:08.42]So get this.
[07:08.92]He hires a team of ghost scientists.
[07:13.04]I'm not going to do this whole stream.
[07:14.54]What's a ghost scientist?
[07:16.60]I don't know.
[07:17.92]Anyway, he hires some of them, right?
[07:20.36]And they can't find anything.
[07:21.47]They've been on the island for two weeks.
[07:25.05]Whoa!
[07:26.69]The ghost is still at large.
[07:27.97]So, the head scientist there, a monkey, calls me up.
[07:31.87]They need help and they want the greatest investigator I have.
[07:35.28]So I said to them, I'll send my best investigator.
[07:37.60]But Lobster Cop wasn't available.
[07:39.46]Is this game like 30 minutes long?
[07:42.28]Well, this is precious game time real estate.
[07:47.67]We're running out of time.
[07:50.43]So I'm asking you the second best investigator.
[07:53.51]I fully understand.
[07:54.51]Lobster cop's abilities far outweigh my own.
[07:57.93]Yeah, but you're pretty good.
[07:59.55]So are you up for it?
[08:00.17]I don't know.
[08:01.47]It sounds scary.
[08:02.09]I have to be very brave.
[08:05.29]I believe in you, Detective.
[08:07.27]That's what I need to hear.
[08:07.95]Thank you, Supervisor.
[08:10.51]Okay.
[08:12.44]Wahoo!
[08:13.86]Can you give me a summary of the case before I go?
[08:16.82]Auto-voice.
[08:19.04]Sure thing.
[08:20.08]The basics are, there's a slow- Wait, is this a kid's game?
[08:23.34]How old do you have to be to play this?
[08:26.66]Okay, what's the cut-off ceiling for age for playing this game?
[08:30.14]Because I know there's cute games, right?
[08:33.30]Oh, that's a cute game for kids.
[08:35.22]But if you're over the age of eight, don't even play it, right?
[08:38.17]Is this one of them?
[08:40.73]There's a sloth who's hearing a lot of spooky ghost noises around his island.
[08:44.11]He calls a bunch of ghost scientists, but they snuck in.
[08:46.61]It's up to you to solve the mystery of the haunted island.
[08:49.77]Why did you just yell haunted island at me?
[08:52.80]Because that's the title of the case.
[08:56.38]Okay.
[08:57.66]Time for you to grab your magnifying glass and get going.
[09:01.83]See you later, Supervisor.
[09:03.77]Good luck.
[09:04.73]Thanks.
[09:12.03]I'm not a cut-off age for video games, if you like it, Jerma.
[09:21.98]Ah, yes.
[09:22.30]I thought this was a mirror.
[09:23.36]Ah, yes.
[09:24.22]My trusty magnifying glass.
[09:25.58]Can't solve mysteries without it.
[09:27.48]Now I can right-click to see up close.
[09:33.44]But I can't do the thing.
[09:34.22]I can't do the thing that they do in every single... When was the last time you saw a magnifying glass in any form of media?
[09:42.31]It wasn't this.
[09:44.23]The magnifying glass is not... They don't use it anymore.
[09:51.05]Nancy Drew.
[09:51.67]No, no, I'm talking like... Alright, let me rephrase that.
[09:55.31]Media that has been consumed by more than a million people.
[09:59.82]Right?
[10:00.20]Like, when was the last time you saw?
[10:01.32]Not, don't, Nancy Drew's doesn't count.
[10:08.02]Sherlock Holmes?
[10:10.24]Time to solve a mystery.
[10:13.04]Do they even use magnifying glasses in Sherlock Holmes?
[10:20.86]Grace Ruxner presents Super Frog.
[10:25.81]I'm going to say that like a thousand times on the stream.
[10:27.75]You know I am.
[10:30.15]Frog Detective Adventure How far away does Super Frog live?
[10:48.35]this is kind of loud I'll turn it down it's on an island starring the detective Mark Larry Moe the mouse Bernie
[11:11.43]This is just, like, cutouts.
[11:22.74]Okay, the Haunted Island.
[11:26.78]I'm ready.
[11:27.72]So I have to solve the case.
[11:28.68]Do a Kermit voice.
[11:39.33]Well, this is a really small island.
[11:40.71]I don't think it's going to be that hard to figure this out.
[11:45.68]Considering... Do you have one camera that's pointed at the island?
[11:51.90]That's all I need.
[11:53.12]Even if it's low.
[11:53.92]It doesn't have to be HD.
[11:57.47]Okay.
[11:58.29]What do you want?
[12:05.96]Oh, you finally made it.
[12:07.16]Thanks for coming on such short notice.
[12:09.25]I've heard so much about your adventures, I'm a huge fan.
[12:12.37]Wow, that's very kind of you.
[12:14.33]When you figured out who was behind the forest theft in Witch Town, I couldn't believe it.
[12:19.45]I thought nobody would ever solve that mystery.
[12:22.17]I mean, who steals an entire forest?
[12:24.64]Oh, you've been following my blog.
[12:27.28]Yeah, I'm MysteryMonkey49.
[12:28.70]I comment all the time.
[12:30.73]I've made a funny joke once and you responded.
[12:33.90]Of course I remember.
[12:35.64]I don't remember.
[12:38.76]Please, MysteryMonkey49 is my online name.
[12:42.10]You could just call me MysteryMonkey.
[12:43.46]Of course.
[12:45.04]Can I ask you some questions about Casey?
[12:47.54]Questions?
[12:48.10]Yes.
[12:49.06]What would you like to know?
[13:00.90]Who should I talk to first?
[13:03.22]You're talking to me already!
[13:05.04]Okay, who should I talk to second?
[13:09.12]Larry, the tall red one.
[13:10.94]He always wants to meet new people.
[13:12.73]Although, I think he mostly wants new people to meet him.
[13:16.57]Not so much the other way around.
[13:18.99]I'll check it out, thanks.
[13:21.03]What would you like to know?
[13:24.37]The resident.
[13:26.93]May I ask who the resident of this island is?
[13:29.97]See you around!
[13:30.41]Was it saying this thing?
[13:31.42]Hmm, maybe a man in a suit.
[14:04.74]Was playing this the compromise you have with the Drew crew?
[14:10.57]What is that?
[14:11.09]Wait.
[14:19.54]Can I pick this up?
[14:23.78]It's Patrick.
[14:24.54]No, it's not.
[14:27.02]Okay, what is it?
[14:27.62]There's cookies?
[14:31.39]Macaroni.
[14:35.01]Come, or it's not mine.
[14:44.42]Hey, you're that detective, right?
[14:47.50]The one that Monkey keeps on going on about.
[14:51.04]That's me.
[14:52.70]I'm so glad they finally brought someone else in.
[14:55.20]I know nothing.
[14:56.56]I really shouldn't have taken the job.
[15:00.26]Why did you take it?
[15:00.94]Well, I'll be honest.
[15:04.10]I thought it was a secret agent job.
[15:06.00]That's what I thought.
[15:08.12]Why would you think that?
[15:10.90]Job listing said ghost scientist.
[15:13.31]That didn't seem like a real job to me.
[15:16.07]I thought it was like a cover, you know.
[15:20.15]One that... One that only smart people could figure out, like me.
[15:28.49]It still could be a cover.
[15:29.57]Maybe they're testing you.
[15:32.35]Oh no no no no you're right I better look competent I'm only joking Sure Can I ask you some questions about Casey?
[15:43.20]What else do you want to know?
[15:50.44]What do you know about noise confirmation?
[15:54.00]I mean I'm not great at this I'd be good at other jobs just letting you know
[15:59.01]But it does seem like the noises coming from this hole aren't from a natural creature.
[16:05.43]They seem to be otherworldly somehow.
[16:07.71]They have a weird and distinct tone.
[16:10.31]Sometimes it sounds like a bird's call.
[16:13.48]But only sometimes.
[16:15.90]Oh, that's not good information.
[16:18.66]Yes, I'm very good at finding things out.
[16:21.68]If you know what I mean.
[16:24.77]Bernie, I'm not a secret agent.
[16:27.25]Uh-huh, no.
[16:30.30]What else do you want to know?
[16:33.76]He's not paying attention beyond the impression.
[16:38.13]Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[16:39.85]We figured it out.
[16:41.27]I'm not paying attention to the story at all.
[16:45.49]I'm just making sure that I sound like Bernie Sanders.
[16:49.18]That's it.
[16:49.66]That's all I cared about.
[16:50.70]I don't know anything.
[16:51.60]I don't even know what he just said.
[16:52.52]I have no idea what's happening right now.
[17:03.48]Okay, let's pay attention.
[17:05.36]Let me figure this out.
[17:06.54]About the hole.
[17:09.36]And this too, this is making me dumb.
[17:12.67]This is making me... I'm thinking dumb.
[17:16.41]You know, what do you think about noise coming down there?
[17:18.33]Like, I'm not even processing that information.
[17:23.85]It's just, I'm losing IQ points when I do detective, frog detective.
[17:29.13]Okay, here we go.
[17:30.74]What do you know about the noises coming from this hole?
[17:35.51]I mean, I'm not great at this.
[17:38.93]But I'd be good at some other stuff.
[17:41.17]Just letting you know, I don't have a problem with you.
[17:44.03]It just seems like the noise is coming from the whole line from a natural creature.
[17:47.26]I know all kinds of creatures in my life.
[17:52.94]They seem otherworldly somehow.
[17:54.24]Okay, alright.
[17:55.58]I have to pay attention.
[17:56.58]No more voices.
[17:57.26]We're done.
[17:58.82]Birds call.
[17:59.86]Only sometimes.
[18:00.76]Okay.
[18:01.24]Birds call.
[18:03.72]Do Obama...
[18:06.60]I'm not sure that I can.
[18:09.60]I'm willing to give it a try.
[18:11.40]On the next moment.
[18:15.33]Secret agent.
[18:16.99]Hold on.
[18:17.33]Wait, wait, wait.
[18:23.17]Alright, why do you want to be a secret agent?
[18:25.43]Secret agents get the best stuff.
[18:27.71]Like, for example, you've got a cool magnifying glass.
[18:29.71]I want one of those.
[18:34.45]Okay, sure you're not.
[18:35.52]Yeah, Bernie winks.
[18:37.46]Hey.
[18:39.46]Oh, hey, look at me!
[18:41.36]Look at... Even if I can't be secret agent, things I give up for... I would love a magnifying glass.
[18:49.04]Alright, there's nothing I want more.
[18:54.12]You want a magnifying glass?
[18:56.91]You just give him mine?
[18:58.35]Alright, nothing, that's it.
[19:04.37]I was saving my points for that.
[19:05.41]But now you can save them for something else.
[19:07.53]Like making one of my emotes black and white.
[19:10.23]Which just makes it harder to see.
[19:13.41]Thanks for the channel points!
[19:18.05]Hey.
[19:26.02]It's me, Larry.
[19:28.50]Hey.
[19:29.28]I did not do it.
[19:32.12]Huh?
[19:33.42]the noises are not coming from me I didn't I Larry did not make these spooky noises that's more suspicious what are you even listening to me I said I didn't make those noises no I heard I just I don't like being accused like this I'm not oh you're not accusing me that's such a relief
[20:03.88]Are you going to ask me a question?
[20:06.62]Yeah.
[20:06.98]Ask me the questions I mean.
[20:13.24]What can you tell me about the North?
[20:14.86]Firstly, I am not the one making them.
[20:17.52]I'm not making the noise.
[20:19.86]Yeah.
[20:20.94]But I know where they're coming from.
[20:25.44]Where?
[20:26.82]They're coming from the cave in the forest.
[20:31.04]Why haven't you told anybody?
[20:33.36]Nobody listens to me.
[20:35.30]They say stuff like, well, Larry, if you won't listen to us, we won't listen to you.
[20:41.08]Which is so weird because I do listen.
[20:45.17]Maybe they... I'm a really great listener.
[20:48.85]So how do we get into... This is just evil Bernie.
[20:53.09]Evil Bernie Sanders.
[20:59.38]Whatever.
[21:01.24]How do we get into his cave?
[21:03.29]Well, I need a few things.
[21:05.41]To get through there, you'll need some sort of explosive device.
[21:09.15]Is that safe?
[21:10.62]We're dealing with ghosts here, Detective.
[21:12.62]None of this is safe.
[21:14.34]Anyway, I'll need a few things.
[21:16.20]I looked up an explosive recipe in one of the old chemistry books.
[21:19.72]I need toothpaste, some wool, a chunk of pure gold, and some pasta.
[21:25.16]Oh, so the normal explosive ingredient.
[21:28.54]There's a standard explosive recipe.
[21:31.02]Yes.
[21:32.07]You want to get into that cave?
[21:33.85]Bring me those ingredients.
[21:36.41]I'll do my best.
[21:38.59]Ask me the question now.
[21:43.53]You have to do a bar.
[21:44.47]I'll try.
[21:45.61]Next card.
[21:48.11]Let's make some dynamite.
[21:49.98]Not yet, detective.
[21:51.14]We still need toothpaste, some wool, a chunk of pure gold, and some pasta.
[21:59.18]Okay.
[22:02.84]Alright, I need... So, I need... Oh, yeah.
[22:04.66]So, give me the... How do I get that pasta?
[22:08.94]I need this.
[22:13.32]Yum.
[22:14.22]It's not mine.
[22:15.62]Take it.
[22:15.88]What are you doing?
[22:26.03]Alright.
[22:29.77]Howdy.
[22:31.25]What are you doing in there?
[22:33.48]Swimming.
[22:35.70]But there's a storm.
[22:37.70]It's not raining yet.
[22:41.34]Besides, it's not actually that unsafe to swim in the storm.
[22:46.64]Everyone keeps telling me to get out of the sea.
[22:51.15]But it's safer in here than it is up there.
[22:55.33]Why is that?
[22:57.81]No ghosts in the water.
[23:01.37]Ghosts can't swim.
[23:03.69]How do you know?
[23:06.27]Morton said.
[23:08.63]You don't look happy in there.
[23:13.07]I guess I'm not.
[23:16.27]Sorry to hear.
[23:18.11]Thanks.
[23:19.35]I asked you why you're so sad.
[23:24.31]Well, it's kind of silly.
[23:27.61]I really want a magnet.
[23:32.30]I told you it's silly.
[23:35.31]Why do you want a magnet?
[23:37.97]Well Go on My dream is to attach a magnet to a boat and hold on Why?
[23:48.71]Boats are fast I'm not fast If I hold on to the magnet I'll be really fast too Nice Right I don't have any idea where to find one though
[24:06.31]And even if I did, there's no way I'm getting out of that water here.
[24:12.13]Until that ghost is found.
[24:15.10]That's interesting.
[24:17.12]Is there anything you need to know?
[24:26.21]Alright, let's process information now.
[24:28.37]Time to process info.
[24:30.95]Alright, why did you want the magnet?
[24:32.29]So I can attach it to the back of a boat and zoom along.
[24:34.41]Alright, so you want a magnet so you can zoom along.
[24:36.09]Okay.
[24:37.13]If it sweetens it, I can give you this big shell in return for a magnet.
[24:40.73]I thought it might be magnetic, but it's not.
[24:43.69]Let's process info for this, like, kids game that I'm not going to be able to complete because I'm doing... I'm doing, like, presidents and presidential candidates.
[24:52.73]Oh, no.
[24:53.96]God damn it.
[24:56.28]Okay.
[24:58.80]How was I supposed to know?
[24:59.72]What am I?
[25:00.14]Scientist.
[25:04.78]Okay, is there anything else you need to know?
[25:05.86]Alright, we need to get a magnet so we can get the shell.
[25:10.57]We need a magnet so we can get the shell.
[25:15.41]We need pasta to get the bomb.
[25:18.21]We need a magnet to get the shell.
[25:24.83]There's like so many, there's a million people here.
[25:27.15]Alright, what is this?
[25:27.91]Is that a magnifying glass?
[25:34.29]Excuse me.
[25:35.09]Stop right there.
[25:35.89]Stop it.
[25:36.42]Stop right there.
[25:38.52]Why?
[25:40.90]My shells.
[25:41.84]My shells.
[25:43.26]Don't step on my shells, please.
[25:46.28]Oh, I won't.
[25:48.17]We can't be sure of that.
[25:49.23]I guess not.
[25:52.63]They're very fragile and very small.
[25:55.95]Be careful.
[25:56.51]Aren't we all?
[26:00.38]I get, please, just, please, be careful.
[26:03.30]Don't touch them.
[26:04.06]Don't step on them.
[26:06.79]Okay.
[26:08.63]You still gonna stand like that?
[26:12.05]Yeah.
[26:13.43]Why?
[26:15.29]I'm alarmed.
[26:17.07]I'm on alert.
[26:19.06]I am protecting my shelves from dangerous feet.
[26:27.49]Wow.
[26:29.15]Sorry.
[26:30.52]I've just worked up about my shells.
[26:34.44]I don't mean to be rude, but what shells?
[26:38.48]I can't see any shells.
[26:40.84]That's because they're small.
[26:42.95]But me?
[26:44.25]Very large.
[26:44.83]I have very big hands.
[26:48.29]Shells are small.
[26:49.35]Hands, enormous.
[26:52.23]How small?
[26:53.37]Too small for your weak magnifying glass.
[26:57.96]Wow.
[27:00.04]I'm sorry, it's the truth.
[27:01.12]It's the truth.
[27:02.04]It's just the truth.
[27:04.10]I had to get this one specifically made for my tiny shells.
[27:09.42]Fine.
[27:09.80]Can I ask you some questions?
[27:15.30]Ask me questions.
[27:16.14]Just be careful.
[27:17.88]Don't touch them.
[27:18.96]Don't go near them.
[27:21.38]I will... No, no, not you.
[27:24.04]You're from the fake news.
[27:25.62]Somebody else, please.
[27:28.42]me yeah okay why don't you just get a bigger shell you fool hey sorry it's just that there's not many big shells around here this is all just a little chef if I could get one sure we gotta get the shell to get the magnifying glass to get the pasta

[28:00.96]We need Magnet to get Shell to get Magnifying Glass to get... Okay.
[28:03.66]Okay, alright, alright.
[28:06.83]Ask me questions.
[28:07.35]We got it, we got it, we got it.
[28:09.49]What about that cave?
[28:15.37]This guy's a partisan streamer.
[28:22.42]Do you know anything about that cave?
[28:24.00]Oh, what?
[28:24.94]Uh, no.
[28:25.54]No.
[28:27.79]No, I... I don't know.
[28:29.79]It might not... Could it be a cave?
[28:32.41]Might not be a cave.
[28:34.63]It couldn't... It might just be a small, dark place.
[28:38.11]That doesn't need to be a cave.
[28:39.11]Who knows?
[28:39.51]Could be anything.
[28:40.99]Looks like a pile of rock.
[28:45.42]There's a cave.
[28:47.92]Well, I guess we'll agree to disagree.
[28:51.54]It's literally a confirmed cave.
[28:54.06]A potato, potato.
[28:55.24]You know, you do you, I do me.
[28:58.49]Okay, let's make sure we do Trump correctly.
[29:03.32]The only way- Listen to me.
[29:06.88]The cam has to go on for this because Donald Trump is one of the only voices where you have to actually move around.
[29:13.82]Okay, like my hands come up in the air like this and cross like this and I close my fingers.
[29:18.42]I don't know.
[29:19.20]You have to move around.
[29:23.41]I'm very, I'm very, let me tell you, like, this doesn't do anything, but I don't know why you just have to do it.
[29:28.91]You're a goblin.
[29:30.09]Get out of here.
[29:35.66]Okay.
[29:36.72]Really?
[29:37.68]Yeah.
[29:39.46]Fair enough.
[29:41.36]Ask me questions, just be careful.
[29:44.95]I changed this one halfway through.
[29:47.55]Now it's somebody else.
[29:50.09]Okay.
[29:52.21]I haven't paid attention to anything.
[29:54.23]Now I know.
[29:54.85]Okay.
[29:56.23]Alright, alright, alright, right.
[29:57.61]What's the first step, though?
[29:58.85]What's the first item?
[30:01.19]We need magnet?
[30:03.29]Oh, God.
[30:03.81]We need potion.
[30:06.12]We need potion to get shell, to get magnet, to get boat, to get fucking pasta, to get... Alright.
[30:11.56]We gotta get... For the first one.
[30:13.72]Hi.
[30:23.48]You okay?
[30:27.67]Yeah.
[30:31.05]Are you sure?
[30:31.51]Well, I have just never talked to a detective before.
[30:37.71]I've heard so many nice things about you.
[30:44.15]I don't want to be embarrassing.
[30:49.99]If I am embarrassing, that would be very bad.
[30:53.91]You're not embarrassing.
[30:55.49]That's very good news.
[30:59.13]That's very good news.
[31:02.03]But the conversation isn't over.
[31:04.01]There's still time.
[31:05.09]I have to be careful.
[31:09.41]Oh.
[31:10.51]Well, it's okay if I ask you some questions?
[31:13.75]Do you have questions for me?
[31:16.27]Questions, yes, or...
[31:22.83]You seem very nervous, why?
[31:24.19]Oh, I... Because of the detective thing I told you Um, I'm afraid of detectives Maybe when I was a kid I had a bad dream about a detective Something like that, I don't know Sorry to hear about your dream What?
[31:42.36]What?
[31:45.59]What?
[31:52.17]No, it's because this is close.
[31:54.45]I know why people are fucking mad right now.
[31:56.71]Because this is getting really close to the thing that everybody fucking hates.
[32:03.02]I know.
[32:03.46]And now everyone's like, no, don't shut up.
[32:09.90]Hey, I'm available.
[32:15.44]And you can feel, and you're like, no, no, no, no, no.
[32:19.32]If he says this with this voice, and he says an A and then a Y followed by an A followed by a Y followed by a second A, I'm going to leave the stream.
[32:28.48]Alright, fine.
[32:39.23]I didn't have a dream about that.
[32:41.47]Why are you afraid of me?
[32:49.23]Sorry about that.
[32:52.13]Fine.
[32:53.39]You've worn me down.
[32:55.17]Damn your extreme detective skills.
[32:58.23]I'm nervous because of Mystery Monkey.
[33:02.37]Mystery Monkey is a huge fan of your blog, so I don't want to make a fool of myself in front of you.
[33:07.83]I just think Mystery Monkey is super neat.
[33:10.61]And I don't want to be embarrassing in case I mess up everything.
[33:17.44]Oh.
[33:18.84]Well, is there anything I can do to help you?
[33:21.38]Hmm.
[33:22.78]There's a dance competition coming up tomorrow.
[33:25.86]I want to compete and show Mystery Monkey that I'm really good at dancing.
[33:30.60]But I don't know what style of dance will impress them.
[33:35.02]Would you ask Mystery Monkey and find out for me?
[33:39.10]I can give you this mouse wash mouthwash in return.
[33:44.76]sure questions yes I'll take them the cream of the crop the cream of the crop oh if you could do me this one favor man fucking god damn it alright that bottle what do you got in there what's in the bottle next to you that's my mouthwash give it to me I'm happy to give you can find out what type of dance style alright we're gonna go mystery monkey
[34:13.06]Okay, doing Randy Savage is one of those voices that... If you go all out and... You really go all out.
[34:20.32]You really... Your voice will be in pain for three days after you do it.
[34:27.38]Guaranteed.
[34:29.20]I don't know how he did that so often.
[34:32.58]He must have had a voice made out of... His vocal cords were probably made out of fucking iron.
[34:39.59]Like, just so much pressure coming out of your throat at the same time.
[34:43.91]So much pressure.
[34:46.75]That was a fucking legend.
[34:51.29]Alright, alright, alright.
[34:52.21]We need to go.
[34:53.30]We gotta talk to the monkey.
[34:55.52]I'll come back.
[34:55.96]I'm getting that bottle.
[34:57.30]This is supposed to take 30 minutes to beat this game.
[34:59.02]I've already beaten the game once.
[35:00.16]Alright, where's...
[35:10.35]you what kind of dance do you like I forgot his voice questions yes what would you like to know what is your favorite dance style hey so um you you like dancing and dance styles I don't understand um I like dancing a lot if that's what you're asking
[35:39.11]Yeah, kind of.
[35:40.95]What type of dancing do you like the most out of all dancing?
[35:45.34]Well, I basically have one move.
[35:47.72]Yeah, but if you saw someone dancing, what scenario would you most likely be, this is such a good dance to me?
[35:56.53]What?
[35:58.23]I guess what I'm trying to ask is what dance style do you like the best?
[36:01.97]Pay attention.
[36:03.77]I think breakdancing is so neat.
[36:05.41]If I saw someone breakdancing, wow, I would swoon.
[36:08.07]I would even go so far to say... I did Randy Savage for one second.
[36:14.70]And, like, it hurts.
[36:15.82]I did it for one second.
[36:18.80]It's alright, I can't do any more voices for the rest of the stream.
[36:21.64]I'd be deeply impressed if I saw somebody breakdance.
[36:24.11]I would want to hang out with them at all times forever.
[36:26.83]That's great.
[36:28.35]I got... Look, I got a... I'll prove it.
[36:32.12]That could be whiskey, but it's not.
[36:33.52]It's water.
[36:36.76]That's been poured over coffee beans and then drained into a glass.
[36:40.72]Still water, technically.
[36:45.41]Alright, sorry, touch change question.
[36:46.59]That's okay.
[36:47.03]I'm not sure it's important to the case.
[36:48.71]Alright, so now let's go get the mouthwash.
[36:52.03]Got a monkey fact.
[36:53.45]Thanks for injuring yourself at the beginning of the stream.
[37:00.06]I feel like I've done that, like, five times already.
[37:02.94]I've hurt myself, like, during a stream, and I'm just like, well... Ouch!
[37:09.10]See you in six hours!
[37:12.76]Ooh, a broom.
[37:16.38]Got a broom.
[37:20.85]Alright, so... What?
[37:26.73]Look, it's you.
[37:29.87]Can I pick it up?
[37:30.37]Alright, here we go.
[37:33.43]I want that mouthwash.
[37:39.13]You have some questions?
[37:40.65]Questions, yes.
[37:45.04]I'm gonna do a fake Brainy Savage.
[37:47.68]Hey, I talked to Mystery Monkey.
[37:49.40]Oh my gosh.
[37:50.58]Did you mention me?
[37:52.34]What did Mystery Monkey say?
[37:55.06]Does Mystery Monkey hate me?
[37:56.44]I'm so embarrassed.
[38:00.03]I didn't mention you.
[38:02.60]That's just Joel.
[38:03.84]Yeah, doesn't Joel do a really good... This is just a bad Joel.
[38:07.76]He does like a perfect Randy Savage.
[38:10.02]I could never compare.
[38:10.88]Yeah, I couldn't.
[38:16.92]Mystery Monkey likes breakdancing the best.
[38:22.04]Joel basically is Randy Savage.
[38:31.06]That's fucking funny.
[38:33.18]Break dancing?
[38:34.34]I think I can do that.
[38:35.96]I gotta start practicing now though.
[38:39.24]Good luck.
[38:40.42]Thanks!
[38:41.54]Oh, here's the mouthwash before I forget.
[38:44.94]Cheers.
[38:45.36]Alright, got the mouthwash.
[38:48.38]Now what the hell do we need to do with this?
[38:55.97]Oh dude, fucking stream's gonna be bopping real soon.
[39:11.27]It even looks like the same character.
[39:14.37]That's what's fucked up.
[39:15.63]Somebody link that gif.
[39:17.31]This is the same character.
[39:18.25]It's the same dance and it's the same person.
[39:28.79]Okay.
[39:30.83]So I need Char.
[39:31.67]We haven't talked to you.
[39:34.23]Who are you?
[39:38.03]Ah, who are you?
[39:39.74]Why, who are you?
[39:40.90]I didn't mean to startle you.
[39:42.86]I'm Frog Detective.
[39:44.54]Oh, okay.
[39:45.84]Don't sneak up on me like that.
[39:48.70]I was visible for the entire approach.
[39:51.36]Well, fine.
[39:53.12]I guess I just don't look so smirky.
[39:58.19]Okay, I'll do my best.
[39:59.87]Sorry, I'm so cranky.
[40:01.95]I haven't slept in two weeks.
[40:04.57]I'm Martin, King of the Island.
[40:08.63]You're a king?
[40:10.73]Well, when I got here, there was nobody else on the island except for me and Finley.
[40:17.55]So I thought I was fine to declare myself as king.
[40:23.34]Finley?
[40:25.16]I don't think Finley cares about that sort of stuff.
[40:27.86]Finley mostly cares about the dance competition.
[40:32.62]No, I meant to ask, who's Finley?
[40:35.40]Oh.
[40:36.58]Okay, then.
[40:41.93]Can I ask you a few questions?
[40:45.81]Go ahead.
[40:47.83]Not questions for me.
[40:52.05]Dance competition.
[40:55.49]You mentioned dance competition.
[40:56.73]Can you tell me a little more about that than you said?
[40:59.77]It's tomorrow.
[41:01.73]Anything else?
[41:03.45]Oh, the best dancer wins.
[41:06.24]Okay.
[41:08.18]You got questions for me?
[41:10.17]This accent's changing every fucking half second.
[41:12.51]I'm being ripped through portals.
[41:15.71]I'm being ripped through accent portals.
[41:18.55]I can't pick one.
[41:20.91]He's moving from country to country to country.
[41:24.87]Who's Finley?
[41:26.93]Someone's playing with the slider.
[41:29.37]Yeah.
[41:32.23]You mentioned your friend Finley.
[41:33.35]Who's that guy?
[41:35.79]Finley lives on a nearby island and comes to visit me every few days.
[41:41.00]The last time I saw Finley, she was talking about this song she wanted to dance to for the competition.
[41:48.43]The moves were pretty amazing.
[41:50.73]Not like me.
[41:51.73]She'll probably win.
[41:55.07]I haven't seen her in a while, but she's probably still prepping for the competition.
[42:01.00]It is tomorrow.
[42:03.50]Not that I'll be in to compete her with what the self-spoken situation going on.
[42:09.72]Got questions for me?
[42:17.21]What about the noises?
[42:20.96]Can you tell me about the noises and where they're coming from?
[42:27.56]I'm not exactly sure where they're coming from, but I know they're coming from a forest!
[42:42.57]How do you know for sure?
[42:45.57]I have a book about ghosts.
[42:47.57]It's called The Ghost Guide Foodproof Ways to Detect the Spirit.
[42:51.50]I've read most of it.
[42:53.46]Anyway, in the book it says that most ghosts can't be seen.
[42:56.64]Get this?
[42:59.34]I haven't seen a single one yet.
[43:10.57]Proof is all there.
[43:12.77]Got questions for me?
[43:14.93]God, like... Why can't we have... The American accent is seriously... It's like... Do you have questions for me?
[43:21.57]You got questions for me?
[43:22.97]You got questions for me?
[43:23.80]Do you have questions for me?
[43:27.74]You guys ever seen that video?
[43:30.16]It's one of my favorite videos.
[43:31.52]It's a dictionary talking about accents.
[43:33.60]It's like...
[43:36.34]On some websites, you can have a definition of a word, right?
[43:39.84]It refers to stand.
[43:40.98]You guys have seen this video?
[43:43.41]Stand versus stand.
[43:44.89]British versus American.
[43:49.11]I've told this already, but there's a lot of new people here.
[43:52.22]So there's this website where you can play different accents for different words and one of the words is stand And the person clicks on the English speaking version of it and it's like stand And then they click on the just American English and it goes stand It sounds like so bad stunned stand
[44:23.71]Did you find it?
[44:24.61]You found it, good, yeah.
[44:29.58]It's like just... One of them just sounds so elegant, and the other one's just like, yeah, whatever.
[44:44.57]Read the YouTube comments?
[44:53.30]stand stand it's funny every time man I haven't seen this video in a while it's funny every time
[45:21.85]Stand.
[45:23.43]One more time.
[45:23.89]One more time.
[45:24.31]We'll move on.
[45:27.77]Stand.
[45:30.79]Stand.
[45:37.58]What is the... Let me see the comments.
[45:43.28]Journal lore.
[45:53.08]But yeah, that's like... That's so funny.
[46:00.44]One year ago.
[46:04.90]A year ago.
[46:05.46]Yeah, we've talked about this as one of my favorite YouTube videos.
[46:09.34]This having 82,000 views is criminal.
[46:10.22]This should be at like 820 million views.
[46:12.91]Yeah, I showed you guys this like a year ago.
[46:24.64]but you know.
[46:27.94]I thought your favorite video was the hog calling contest.
[46:30.59]Um, it's changed a little bit over the years.
[46:33.63]It's changed a little bit.
[46:50.56]that's a re-upload oh well whatever alright uh what about your nerves you seem super nervous is there something I can do to help you it's just the ghosts getting me down I haven't been able to sleep I'm kind of annoyed too because I usually love hearing stories about ghosts read all about them on the cyberweb.com but now I'm living one
[47:19.88]I'm sure we'll get to the bottom of things.
[47:22.20]Bottom of the grave, more like it.
[47:25.35]What?
[47:26.79]That made more sense in my head.
[47:28.01]I guess I mean like we'll probably die before the mystery is solved.
[47:33.95]That's pretty dark.
[47:36.14]Dark, just like the conclusion of this tale.
[47:40.76]Sorry if I'm being dramatic.
[47:43.95]You know I'm a good detective, right?
[47:46.32]I've solved every case I've taken on.
[47:48.48]Except the mystery of how to put on a hat.
[47:49.90]I don't like hats.
[47:51.84]My head is a strange shape.
[47:54.08]It really is.
[47:56.36]The point is, you're safe.
[47:58.67]I'm going to find the culprit.
[47:59.81]The best thing you can do is sit in the back.
[48:02.15]Everything will be okay.
[48:04.29]I don't feel okay.
[48:06.03]I'm finding it hard to calm down.
[48:07.41]I understand ghosts are scary.
[48:10.70]But it might not be a ghost.
[48:13.17]You really think it's not a ghost?
[48:16.59]I don't know for sure.
[48:17.41]Oh.
[48:18.47]Let's try a visualization exercise.
[48:23.07]What's a visu... exorcism?
[48:27.50]It's a thing where we pretend.
[48:29.20]Imagine you're on a beach surrounded by calming waves.
[48:33.32]You can feel cool breeze on your face.
[48:36.00]The waves slowly move in and then out.
[48:38.56]It's a safe beach.
[48:40.44]What beach is it?
[48:42.22]This beach.
[48:44.11]This isn't a safe beach.
[48:46.35]There's a ghost here.
[48:48.83]No, the ghost is on holiday.
[48:51.55]Oh, okay.
[48:53.20]Where is it?
[48:54.78]On a road trip.
[48:56.74]Cool.
[48:58.04]Can we visualize that we're on a road trip instead?
[49:02.84]But the ghost is on the road trip.
[49:06.10]Great point.
[49:07.06]Continue.
[49:09.33]Anyway, the waves are coming in and out slowly.
[49:12.47]There's nothing to worry about.
[49:14.23]No ghost around at all.
[49:16.29]The ghost is on a road trip.
[49:19.75]Yep, nothing to fear.
[49:21.33]A nice sandy beach.
[49:23.25]Just me and the ocean.
[49:30.40]How do you feel?
[49:34.36]So relaxed.
[49:37.09]Great, me too.
[49:39.11]Thanks so much, detective.
[49:42.71]That's okay.
[49:44.97]I want to give you something as thanks.
[49:47.47]Perhaps a piece of my crown.
[49:54.49]A chunk of pure gold.
[49:56.64]Wow, that's so kind.
[49:58.24]It's really heavy.
[50:00.56]It better be.
[50:01.24]It's made out of pure gold, man.
[50:04.90]Why?
[50:05.24]I like gold.
[50:09.00]Okay.
[50:11.26]Got questions for me?
[50:21.63]What?
[50:22.53]Weirdly... Weird sexual voice?

[50:31.50]Alright, I got a pure gold.
[50:35.20]Okay, I got this potion.

[51:17.73]I got the magnet.
[51:18.39]Okay.

[52:55.89]I have a big show if you want one.
[52:58.41]What?
[53:00.47]How did you do this?
[53:01.87]Somebody?
[53:02.21]How did you do that?
[53:04.17]It's a long story.
[53:06.09]Oh, in that case, I don't care.
[53:07.89]Just give me the show.
[53:09.55]Don't care.
[53:11.61]I hate stories, especially long ones.
[53:15.59]Okay.
[53:16.83]Anyway, I totally want the shell.
[53:18.67]Can I swap you for the shell real quickly?
[53:25.20]I have this magnifying glass.
[53:28.32]Look at the tiny shells.
[53:30.66]They're very small.
[53:33.56]I won't need it now that I have this big shell.
[53:38.14]Cool, thanks.
[53:41.18]You're still standing weird.
[53:43.92]I'm still on alert.

[53:49.36]Now get out of here.
[53:53.59]Wow.

[54:51.07]All of my dreams coming true.
[54:53.29]We got Medicare for all.
[54:55.07]We got magnifying glasses.
[54:57.49]And remember, I was the first one that put forth the magnifying glass bill of 1981.
[55:03.90]Best day ever.
[55:08.54]Is there anything I can do to repay you?
[55:11.03]Do you need any help with your secret agent business?
[55:14.84]I'm not a secret agent.

[55:26.14]I always eat as cheap as I can.
[55:29.25]Little bit of olive oil on your pasta, that's all you need.
[55:33.15]Some of these people put tomato sauce on their pasta.
[55:36.29]Too much.
[55:37.81]Too expensive.
[55:41.12]Pasta is all.
[55:43.96]If there's one thing I love, apart from the thrill of secrecy, it's pasta.
[55:49.97]Anyway, my appetite is satiated from the deliciousness of this magnifying glass.
[55:55.71]That's a weird way to word that.
[55:58.69]Whatever.

[56:39.36]We need wool.
[56:42.24]How do I get wool?
[56:47.39]Larry David and Bernie Sanders are the same person.
[56:53.55]Didn't they, like, meet?
[56:55.33]And they just kind of started going, like... And they just, like, kind of were yelling at each other for, like, a minute or two.
[57:06.11]I fucking love Larry David.
[57:10.50]If you've never seen Curb Your Enthusiasm... Just... Just... What are you doing?
[57:15.41]Like, do it.
[57:16.43]What are you doing?
[57:19.39]Alright, so what... What now?
[57:20.69]I need... Oh, you got... Whoa!
[57:22.29]Right here!
[57:22.57]Hey!
[57:34.06]How's it hanging?
[57:35.62]Fine, I guess.
[57:36.50]Bored, mostly.
[57:39.41]Why are you bored?
[57:40.98]That's suspicious.
[57:42.62]Suspicious?
[57:43.84]Why?
[57:45.06]Surely you can't just say I'm suspicious.
[57:49.28]There's no rule against it.
[57:51.58]I'm not being suspicious at all.
[57:54.91]I guess not.
[57:57.29]Sorry for calling you suspicious.
[57:59.47]That's okay.
[58:01.55]Why are you bored?
[58:03.51]Isn't hunting ghosts supposed to be exciting?
[58:06.07]For the first week, sure.
[58:07.45]Not now, though.
[58:08.99]I've been at this post the entire time.
[58:11.70]I'm shedding everywhere.
[58:14.04]Gross.
[58:15.50]I know.
[58:15.88]You mind if I ask you a few questions?
[58:19.78]Ask away.
[58:23.34]Shedding?
[58:24.80]Why are you shedding so much?
[58:27.80]I haven't had a trim in ages.
[58:29.32]It's just so yuck.
[58:31.37]Split ends everywhere.
[58:33.45]I'm usually getting cut once a week, but it's been two weeks now.
[58:37.50]Yuck, it's so gross.
[58:40.34]It's totally fine.
[58:42.28]Thanks for trying to spare my feelings, but there is wool everywhere.
[58:46.92]I think everyone is so grossed out by it.
[58:51.85]Surely that's not true.
[58:54.05]Maybe not, but it feels true in my heart.
[58:57.85]I think most people like wool.
[59:00.12]Use for so much stuff.
[59:02.60]Like what?
[59:04.47]My jumper is made out of wool.
[59:09.29]Wait, are you for real?
[59:10.87]Yes.
[59:12.19]That's weird.
[59:13.39]It's weird that you're wearing my hair.
[59:15.63]Wool is pretty gross too.
[59:17.33]That's why I keep mine short.
[59:20.23]I don't think wool is gross at all.
[59:23.11]Okay, but what if I wore a coat made of your slime?
[59:26.71]What you?
[59:28.47]Gross, right?
[59:30.91]Sure, but slime is kind of gross anyway.
[59:33.67]And I'm not saying that as someone who is very slimy.
[59:37.29]I am saying that.
[59:39.77]Wool is worn by most people.
[59:42.09]This is the first time I've heard someone wearing a wool.
[59:45.97]I think that makes you the weird one.
[59:48.01]Plus, I'm pretty sure the shirt you're wearing is wool.
[59:54.29]Wait, wait.
[59:55.45]What?
[59:56.88]I'm wearing another sheep's hair?
[60:00.17]I'm pretty sure, yeah.
[60:02.51]Gross!
[60:04.71]I'm happy to take your wool away from you if you'd like.
[60:07.20]I mean, your own way, sir, whatever.
[60:10.70]Oh, yes, please, but you'll need something to clean it up with.
[60:14.10]Like a broom or fire or something.
[60:17.50]Okay, cool.
[60:18.46]I probably won't use fire.
[60:20.70]Okay.
[60:21.04]I can't believe I'm wearing wool.
[60:25.65]What if it's Barney's?
[60:28.89]What if I ask you some more questions?
[60:31.67]What if I ask away?
[60:32.63]Hey, I got that broom.
[60:38.15]Ready to clean?
[60:40.27]Yeah, it's amazing.
[60:41.29]Thanks, Detective.
[60:43.27]Can I keep this broom?
[60:46.05]Absolutely.
[60:47.41]Can I keep your wool?
[60:51.01]It's still weird, but... Yeah, knock yourself out.
[60:55.78]What?
[60:56.94]I mean, like, take all the wool you want.
[61:00.42]Not physically knock yourself out.
[61:03.00]What are you, stupid?
[61:05.74]Phew.
[61:08.34]Alright, I'm ready.
[61:14.39]Is this The Witcher?
[61:16.93]Alright, here we go.
[61:30.05]Four questions.
[61:31.61]Ask me them the questions I mean.
[61:33.35]Those ones.
[61:36.87]Can you list the ingredients one more time?
[61:38.79]Toothpaste.
[61:40.17]Gold.
[61:41.67]Chunk of gold.
[61:43.18]And some pasta.
[61:45.46]Thanks.
[61:47.76]Do I not have toothpaste?
[61:51.10]Wait.
[61:51.98]That doesn't count?
[61:55.12]That's mouthwash.
[61:55.68]Where would I get the toothpaste?
[61:56.51]Toothpaste.
[62:02.12]Oh, there's more.
[62:04.77]Wait, bug.
[62:05.47]There's a bug.
[62:06.81]Oh, wait a minute.
[62:07.59]Holy shit.
[62:08.15]There's a small, gotta be spider.
[62:29.41]Howdy. Howdy. Howdy. Howdy.
[62:55.42]Oh, okay.
[62:57.08]Can I call you T-Dick?
[62:59.70]T-Dick?
[63:01.46]Or whatever.
[63:08.40]Yes.
[63:09.79]Nice.
[63:12.35]I have some questions.
[63:13.17]Is that okay?
[63:14.53]Take it away, D-Tick.
[63:20.89]Why aren't you wearing a lab coat like the other scientists?
[63:24.31]It's my day off.
[63:26.07]I've been working so hard for the last two weeks.
[63:28.97]It's very important to take a break and get some sun.
[63:33.53]You're right.
[63:35.15]Uh, not about the sun.
[63:36.03]About taking day off.
[63:38.49]Yeah, I didn't pick a great day for it.
[63:42.21]Sorry to question you on your day off.
[63:44.91]Take it away, D-Tech.
[63:48.45]Dutch, well, I'll tell you something.
[63:56.37]Arthur, hope you don't mind me saying, but you have wonderful teeth.
[64:03.52]Thank you, thank you.
[64:04.70]I'm so glad someone finally noticed.

[64:31.73]Well, where can I get some of my own toothpaste?
[64:36.86]Do you have teeth?
[64:41.74]Well, I could give you my tube, but I would need something else to keep my mouth fresh.
[64:48.31]I'll think about it.
[64:48.87]Can I ask you some questions?
[64:51.10]Take it away, D-Tech.
[64:53.46]Mouthwash.
[64:56.22]I have some mouthwash for you.
[64:58.30]Amazing.
[64:58.84]Thanks.

[67:18.49]Okay.
[67:19.15]Oh, my pasta.
[67:20.05]My pasta.
[67:20.77]I got pasta here.
[67:21.65]Okay.
[67:22.24]It's me.
[67:24.20]Everyone is Bernie.
[67:27.84]Wait, that's not true.
[67:28.82]That's not necessarily true.
[67:31.52]Oh, FPS gameplay.
[67:48.90]Every one of them is from Alabama.
[67:50.38]That's not true.
[67:53.18]There was that one guy that was from every country on Earth.
[67:56.40]So, I mean, that's not true.
[68:15.52]The stream will be popping.
[68:17.88]This is the bird.
[68:31.43]It's Finley.
[68:33.57]Oh, hi.
[68:34.15]Who are you?
[68:38.60]Are you a ghost?
[68:41.44]What?
[68:43.42]I don't think so.
[68:47.68]Are you sure?
[68:50.28]Hmm.
[68:52.12]Yep.
[68:55.04]That's great.
[68:58.62]You're not wrong.
[69:01.56]So, um, who are you?
[69:05.18]Finley!
[69:07.58]Who are you?
[69:10.24]The detective.
[69:11.92]Howdy.
[69:15.58]Wait a minute.
[69:16.96]Finley.
[69:19.13]I know that name.
[69:21.84]I'm pretty well known around here.
[69:23.60]Around local dance circles.
[69:25.52]Fuck.
[69:26.96]No, I can't.
[69:27.98]I can't do Irish.
[69:29.56]Not Irish.
[69:30.46]Not Irish.
[69:31.40]Anything but Irish.
[69:33.19]You're Martin's friend.
[69:35.23]Yeah, what are you doing here?
[69:38.49]Practicing for the dance competition.
[69:40.75]It's tomorrow.
[69:42.21]How long have you been down here?
[69:46.28]Jeez, like two weeks, I think.
[69:49.34]I didn't even realize.
[69:50.14]Ha.
[69:51.22]Ha.
[69:53.20]Wait.
[69:54.40]Two weeks?
[69:55.94]Have you seen any ghosts around?
[69:58.40]No.
[69:59.61]Just me down here.
[70:01.91]Does Martin know you're here?
[70:04.03]I don't think so.
[70:05.05]He never comes down here.
[70:06.89]Really?
[70:07.23]Why not?
[70:08.41]He thinks every dark space is haunted.
[70:09.83]Oh, he reads all those ghost books and thinks there's a ghost in every square.
[70:14.70]It's good for me, though.
[70:15.42]Perfect spot to try and
[70:18.50]You've been dancing for two weeks, right?
[70:22.60]Alright.
[70:23.78]Yeah.
[70:24.85]Aren't you tired?
[70:25.55]I mean, I take naps.
[70:32.43]And these mushrooms are super nutritious.
[70:36.01]Gross.
[70:37.31]Mushrooms are disgusting.
[70:40.03]That's your opinion, detective.
[70:42.83]No, it's a fact.
[70:46.39]Okay.
[70:47.49]Okay.
[70:50.67]Anyway, Martin's been super spooked out because he's been hearing weird noises all over Highland.
[70:56.12]Any idea what that is?
[70:59.70]I've been listening to my radio while fencing.
[71:02.86]Let me tell you, it has been crazy.
[71:09.36]This cave has lots of holes in it.
[71:10.83]The sound from your radio could easily travel up to the surface.
[71:14.86]I bet it's not super warm, too.
[71:18.14]You know, you've been trapped in here, right?
[71:20.16]The cave's been blocked off by rocks.
[71:26.70]Really?
[71:30.22]Really?
[71:31.50]Really?
[71:32.08]Really?
[71:32.41]Okay, here we are.
[71:34.05]No, yeah, right here.
[71:35.51]Right there.
[71:36.05]I think this is it right here.
[71:37.89]That's so funny.
[71:39.83]Yeah, you could have died.
[71:42.91]Then I'd actually be a ghost.
[71:45.32]I didn't even think of that.
[71:47.52]Yeah.
[71:53.28]Anyway, let's go.
[71:54.36]Let's leave.
[71:55.94]Yup.
[72:05.61]Oh, look at me.
[72:14.57]Finley.
[72:17.04]Hi, Martin.
[72:18.82]Hi.
[72:20.24]Hey.
[72:22.35]Hi.
[72:23.71]What are you doing here?
[72:26.59]I was in the cave.
[72:29.25]You?
[72:29.75]What?
[72:31.39]How did you get in?
[72:32.95]It's been sealed up for weeks.
[72:35.58]Two weeks, to be exact.
[72:39.82]Wait a minute.
[72:41.86]As it turns out, there was never a ghost.
[72:44.72]It was Finley in the cave the whole time.
[72:47.34]She was so wrapped up in practicing, she didn't even notice Cave got caved in.
[72:51.74]The noises were from her radio, carried up to her surface, and sounded really scary.
[72:57.28]But, my ghost books!
[73:00.58]I was so sure it was a ghost.
[73:04.16]No, just me.
[73:06.26]Ghosts assure you, you should never trust books.
[73:08.53]Don't ever read one.
[73:10.03]Always use the internet instead.
[73:12.95]Haha, yeah!
[73:14.49]books are without exception factually inaccurate yep wait hold on hi there apologies for the interruption I hope you're enjoying the game I won't keep you for long well I agree with the detective on most issues there are contexts in which books can be very useful and informative it's important to check the validity of the author's sources
[73:40.51]And to check the book is up to date.
[73:42.71]The internet can also be a useful place to find information.
[73:45.31]But make sure you're getting your information from a trusted site.
[73:49.00]Thank you for your time.
[73:49.90]Enjoy the rest of the game.
[73:50.94]So anyway, as I was saying, books have no place in society.
[73:59.68]Sure thing.
[74:00.68]That makes a lot of sense.
[74:02.82]Thank you for opening my eyes to the usefulness...
[74:06.15]of the internet and the useless snakes of books fuck you're very welcome the useless snake so just to be clear you were practicing for the competition this whole time yep I needed to win it I'm still not entirely sure what this dance competition involves
[74:33.33]Dance competition.
[74:34.95]Best dancer wins.
[74:36.97]Who else is competing?
[74:40.39]That's a good point.
[74:42.67]Just us, I guess.
[74:44.67]Don't forget Moe the mouse.
[74:47.51]Who?
[74:49.59]One of the ghost scientists.
[74:52.38]The what?
[74:53.74]Don't worry about it.
[74:55.80]I think we need more entrants.
[74:58.66]I know a few hardworking friends who could use a good boogie.
[75:02.57]But they won't be here tomorrow.
[75:05.31]Well, let's move the competition to today!
[75:15.23]Before we dance, I just want to say, thanks for solving the mystery, Detective.
[75:21.89]No problem at all.
[75:22.66]I had a lot of fun.
[75:24.96]Help.
[75:26.08]Larry figured out where the noises were coming from.
[75:29.16]Larry?
[75:29.56]Is that the lobster?
[75:31.30]The one that talks over everybody?
[75:32.56]Yep.
[75:35.78]Well, I give my thanks to Larry, too.
[75:39.43]Shall we buggy?
[75:41.09]Let's go!
[75:41.59]Did I beat the game?
[75:57.49]Holy shit.
[75:59.21]Frog Detective's fucking got some monster moves.
[76:06.17]He needs some space.
[76:07.14]Hey, he's just flexing on everybody.
[76:16.06]Yeah, he really is.
[76:16.72]Like, everyone's gonna get out of the way.
[76:25.73]Who has the best moves though?
[76:29.52]Let's see.
[76:34.90]What a mystery.
[76:43.08]Tier list.
[76:44.71]Okay, I think we've practiced enough.
[76:47.13]Wait a minute.
[76:48.35]Who's judging?
[76:49.89]Wait, this is the best part of the whole game.
[76:52.25]I'll do it.
[76:55.94]Alright, we have to decide.
[76:56.90]Let's go.
[77:01.06]Alright, alright, okay.
[77:05.14]Alright.
[77:15.20]No, no, you can't pull out the robot.
[77:17.06]No.
[77:18.62]Next.
[77:21.29]Alright, I like it.
[77:28.21]Alright, that's the best one so far.
[77:30.13]That's the single lady.
[77:32.98]The single lady dance.
[77:36.28]Nah, it's Robot 2.
[77:38.02]Nope.

[78:26.02]It was Larry.
[78:26.48]It was Larry.
[78:26.86]It was Lobster.
[78:27.79]No, no, no.
[78:28.31]There's no poll.
[78:28.87]It was just that like single ladies.
[78:30.77]Yeah.
[78:31.43]Yep.
[78:35.70]There are no votes for that one.
[78:37.73]Sorry.
[78:38.27]This is the election.
[78:39.55]What was the plot of the game?
[78:41.25]I don't know.
[78:42.43]I was concentrating on doing voices for 85% of it.
[78:47.59]I don't even know what we did.
[79:06.49]We went to an island and we solved it.
[79:08.05]There was a cave that was noise was coming out of it.
[79:11.69]I don't remember anything.
[79:12.89]Hopefully you guys can know.
[79:21.94]New game plus.
[79:22.80]Pog.
[79:23.24]Oh, this is cool.
[79:29.00]This is the last case that we solved.
[79:31.00]Okay.
[79:32.26]Cool.
[79:33.52]I wonder what happened there.
[79:36.15]All I know is that there's a... On this picture, there's a giant enemy.
[79:39.67]Crap.
[79:41.87]No.
[79:42.19]Fuck that.
[79:42.57]I'm not doing that one again.
[79:51.26]I'm sorry.
[79:51.90]I'm sorry.
[79:52.36]I don't want to keep that.
[79:53.56]Okay.
[79:54.22]When we do the community content night, just know.
[79:56.70]I'm continuing to perpetuate the meme of the giant enemy spider.
[80:00.80]Because there are like 10 giant enemy spider remixes tonight.
[80:06.14]So, alright, we're going to, there's a lot of remixes already.
[80:14.82]Frog Detective Crime Solving Agency.
[80:16.70]Frog Detective speaking.
[80:18.23]How can I help you?
[80:20.53]Detective?
[80:21.77]Clube Advisor.
[80:23.77]Great work on the Haunted Island mystery.
[80:26.53]Thank you.
[80:26.91]I tried really hard.
[80:29.11]I don't think even Lobster Cop could have solved that one.
[80:32.73]I think you're underestimating Lobster Cop.
[80:35.71]You're probably right.
[80:37.81]Anyway, as I saw you busted a groove at the dance competition.
[80:43.15]Yeah, where'd you see that?
[80:45.27]It was on TV.
[80:46.65]Every channel.
[80:49.19]Every channel?
[80:50.98]In HD.
[80:52.90]Cool.
[80:53.88]I didn't even see any cameras.
[80:56.70]Well, you certainly impressed the public.
[80:59.42]My phone has been ringing off the hook.
[81:01.92]Mostly the calls are about your dancing.
[81:04.44]But I did get one call about a case.
[81:07.36]Have you heard of Warlock Woods?
[81:10.90]I haven't.
[81:12.64]Well, there's some very strange going on things around there.
[81:18.20]They need our best investigator on the job.
[81:22.09]Lobster cop was not available.
[81:26.61]Can you handle another case, detective?
[81:29.27]I can handle anything.
[81:33.55]The detective will return.
[81:36.49]In fucking Star Wars.
[81:39.27]Episode who?
[81:40.43]The Case of the Invisible Wizard.
[81:43.44]Oh no, that's the wrong franchise.
[81:45.34]Captain America will return.
[81:46.66]Not Star Wars will return.
[81:50.80]Well, everyone knows Star Wars will return.
[81:52.60]That was cute.
[81:58.05]It's already out.
[82:04.59]It's out now.
[82:05.51]Play it.
[82:06.29]Play it right now.
[82:07.41]No, but no.
[82:07.95]No, no, no, no.
[82:08.61]We don't have time for that.
[82:10.29]We don't have time for that.
[82:11.23]How long is it?
[82:17.10]Yes, we do.
[82:20.58]It's another hour.
[82:23.70]It's 30 minutes.
[82:26.40]Alright, alright.
[82:26.92]Let's do another one.
[82:27.74]Let's do Frog Detective Chapter 2.
[82:29.36]Let's go.
[82:29.76]Alright, let's do it.
[82:30.52]Alright, let's do it.
[82:32.00]Guys, I think I already own it.
[82:33.94]Do I?
[82:40.92]Case of the Invisible Wizard.
[82:43.52]Done.
[82:44.80]Already got it.
[82:48.34]Takes like an hour to build.
[82:49.14]Alright, then fucking whatever.
[82:50.16]Fine.
[82:50.74]This is cute.
[82:56.11]We got time for community.
[82:57.87]This community content is not going to be as long as the last one.
[83:01.77]There's like half as much stuff.
[83:03.19]Because it's like a part two.
[83:04.95]And it's catching us up to like last week.
[83:09.41]Oh, look at that.
[83:09.85]I do have it already.
[83:13.09]Yeah, don't worry.
[83:15.29]Uh, this one is... What's it called?
[83:17.13]You're gonna hear a loud... And I'm really sorry about that.
[83:20.21]Actually, it wasn't even that loud.
[83:24.41]Dude.
[83:24.97]Hyper.
[83:25.71]Hyper the chat.
[83:26.69]Hyper the chat.
[83:29.21]Hypetrain?
[83:30.43]What the fuck is going on?
[83:31.75]Hypetrain started!
[83:32.77]I disabled Hypetrain, so don't even try.
[83:35.93]They physically are turned off on this channel.
[83:44.81]Where is it?
[83:49.74]Looking for a game to capture.
[83:55.38]Found one.
[83:57.90]Found one.
[83:58.76]Frog Detective 2.
[83:59.56]I gotta change the game, right?
[84:02.26]Because this is not accurate.
[84:05.46]We're in Frog Detective 2 now.
[84:13.15]The Case of the Invisible Wizard.
[84:16.38]This is cute.
[84:18.20]Isn't that cute?
[84:23.14]Speedrun it?
[84:24.86]Can I speedrun this?
[84:26.68]No, I don't want to speedrun it.
[84:27.74]I want to take my time and have some fun.
[84:32.97]Alright, let's keep going.
[84:35.10]Here we go.
[84:35.78]Frog Detective 2.
[84:37.56]New voices.
[84:38.30]It's a new game.
[84:38.86]There's going to be new voices.
[84:40.54]And unfortunately, the voice actor from Frog Detective 1 did not move on to Frog Detective 2.
[84:47.21]He was in the middle of other projects.
[84:50.33]So that's the biggest gripe that I think a lot of people have with this one, I've heard.
[84:53.67]So hopefully that it's still, you know, hopefully people still think it's any good.
[85:01.50]I don't know.
[85:01.76]Let's find out.
[85:04.02]Frog Detective Crime Solving Agency.
[85:05.92]Frog Detective speaking.
[85:08.93]Hey, Detective.
[85:10.61]Hi, Supervisor.
[85:13.25]Why did you hang up on me?
[85:15.35]Huh?
[85:17.13]We were talking just a moment ago about a new case.
[85:20.43]The one at Warlock Woods, right?
[85:24.18]Yeah.
[85:25.96]I hung up because I got too excited about solving another mystery.
[85:30.78]That's understandable.
[85:37.72]What can you tell me about this new case?
[85:41.22]It's a doozy, detective.
[85:43.14]Hold on to your hat.
[85:45.38]Supervisor, you know I can't wear hats.
[85:49.76]Sorry, anyway.
[85:52.12]What?
[85:54.37]What the fuck do you want me to do about this?
[85:56.69]I already told you what happened.
[86:02.93]Alright, you want me to mute his sections?
[86:05.10]Hold on.
[86:05.82]I know that voice actor.
[86:07.20]You want me to call him?
[86:08.94]And see if he'll come into a Discord call and read it?
[86:11.56]Well... It's gonna cost a lot of money.
[86:14.92]I know that actor.
[86:16.80]Okay.
[86:17.12]Alright, alright, alright.
[86:18.31]Let me see if they're on Discord.
[86:23.41]Yeah, they are.
[86:24.97]They're online.
[86:26.61]Well, just hold on.
[86:27.47]Wait until I get him in a call.
[86:29.52]Couple days ago, a new resident moved in.
[86:31.86]A shy kind of gal doesn't like to be the center of attention.
[86:35.40]Anyway, she settles into the new house and doesn't go outside to greet anyone.
[86:40.69]The residents of the town feel like they need to welcome her properly, so they organize a welcoming parade.
[86:47.11]Great idea!
[86:48.83]Absolutely.
[86:50.19]But someone in the town seemed to think otherwise.
[86:53.29]Last night, the parade decorations were destroyed.
[86:56.68]What?
[86:58.78]I know, right?
[86:59.52]So rude.
[87:00.78]Nobody has any leads on the case.
[87:02.32]They don't.
[87:02.94]I'm waiting for them to fucking reply to me.
[87:04.82]Jesus, guys.
[87:07.14]I can't just turn it off.
[87:08.60]I'm waiting for a reply on Discord.
[87:10.74]Everybody needs to relax.
[87:11.84]Holy shit.
[87:19.24]That's where you... Alright, hold on.
[87:25.93]Are you fucking around now?
[87:29.63]Jesus fucking Christ, hold on.
[87:39.01]Come on.
[87:42.78]Hello?
[87:43.82]Hey, what's up?
[87:44.70]It's me.
[87:45.80]Oh, hey, what's going on?
[87:46.62]How are you doing?
[87:47.70]I'm doing good.
[87:48.20]Did you get my messages that I sent you?
[87:50.04]Yes, I did.
[87:52.16]Alright, are you cool with doing this?
[87:54.33]Yeah, it's okay.
[87:56.74]Alright, so I'm going to mute the frog sections and then you can come in.
[88:00.83]And, I mean, it might be delayed a little bit, but it's okay.
[88:03.85]No, that's fine with me.
[88:04.61]I'll do that.
[88:05.07]That's fine.
[88:06.61]Cool.
[88:06.83]Real voice, by the way.
[88:08.29]Real voice, by the way.
[88:12.60]Are you ready?
[88:13.82]Yeah, I'm ready.
[88:14.26]Just wait a minute.
[88:14.78]I'll read.
[88:15.86]Okay.
[88:24.26]Oh.
[88:25.28]Oh, sorry, sorry.
[88:26.67]That's me.
[88:27.47]I'm the detective.
[88:30.39]I'm aware.
[88:30.91]Warlock Woods is a magic town, so it's not the easiest place to get to.
[88:37.82]You'll need to take an enchanted cart to the end of the line, then travel the rest of the way on foot.
[88:43.78]Too easy.
[88:45.94]You'll need to question everybody to get to the bottom of things.
[88:49.34]Do you think you can solve the mystery?
[88:56.34]Great.
[88:57.08]Hop to it.
[89:00.26]Haha.
[89:02.14]Oh, I forgot to mention.
[89:03.76]The new resident of the woods is special.
[89:07.32]She's invisible.
[89:13.57]That was loud.
[89:16.21]Hey, can you... Are you eating something?
[89:19.75]Yeah.
[89:24.42]Can you put... I got a lot of people here watching.
[89:27.47]I'm sorry, sorry.
[89:31.99]That was loud.
[89:35.59]And a wizard.
[89:40.50]An invisible wizard.
[89:43.84]Cool.
[89:44.08]What's the relevance of her being invisible?
[89:49.59]Nobody knows what she looks like, so they're really excited to find out.
[89:53.50]Hence the parade and the decorations and the celebrations.
[89:57.54]They want her to be un-visible?
[90:00.38]De-invisible?
[90:01.44]Uh, uh, visible.
[90:07.85]Exactly.
[90:09.39]Anyway, do you have everything you need?
[90:11.03]Um, I have my shoes, my jumper, my pants.
[90:15.23]I think I'm missing something.
[90:17.49]Your magnifying glass?
[90:19.59]Of course.
[90:21.21]It's on the table next to the die.
[90:22.69]Why was I gonna say diaper?
[90:23.67]I was gonna say diaper.
[90:27.85]Yeah, you're not very good at reading.
[90:29.61]What the fuck am I?
[90:30.45]How is that?
[90:30.81]Why was I going to say diaper?
[90:33.07]Unprofessional.
[90:34.25]Shut the fuck up.
[90:39.91]Dickhead.
[90:41.45]That's very rude to say.
[90:46.31]Am I getting paid for this, by the way?
[90:55.60]Turn this one.
[90:59.82]Turn that one back on.
[91:02.04]Thanks, supervisor.
[91:04.28]Good luck, detective.
[91:18.27]Ah, my trusty magnifying glass.
[91:20.31]I can't solve mysteries without it.
[91:27.64]What the fuck?
[91:30.66]What, he's calling me now?
[91:32.22]He's calling me?
[91:32.74]You're calling me now?
[91:35.75]Should I answer it?
[91:39.45]Hello?
[91:41.11]I'm sorry.
[91:42.49]Okay.
[91:43.35]It's alright.
[91:43.77]Yes, I'll pay you, by the way.
[91:45.22]I didn't mean to fly off the handle like that.
[91:47.04]I'll turn it back down.
[91:47.78]Same thing.
[91:48.32]Same deal.
[91:51.06]Okay.
[91:52.10]Okay.
[91:52.82]Let's go.
[91:56.29]Ah, my trustworthy magnifying glass.
[91:58.25]I can't solve mysteries without it.
[92:00.37]Well, maybe I could.
[92:01.10]But I wouldn't want to.
[92:06.02]It's missing background white noise from his mic.
[92:12.50]No!
[92:13.54]No!
[92:14.38]Don't give me that idea, please!
[92:18.13]Fuck!
[92:19.51]God damn it.
[92:20.61]Hold on.
[92:22.09]That's fucking stupid enough for me to think it's funny.
[92:24.43]Just wait.
[92:34.16]He has push to talk on.
[92:35.56]Yeah, but hold on.
[92:43.54]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[92:44.94]Give me one second.
[92:45.80]This is worth it to me.
[92:46.90]Be right back.
[93:57.38]Okay, I just had to, uh, need to just fix this mic.
[94:00.11]Something was wrong with this mic.
[94:01.79]Sorry.
[94:03.51]There we go.
[94:09.15]Look through your magnifier with right click.
[94:12.19]Yes, yes, yes, we know how to do this.
[94:13.35]Let's go.
[94:27.30]Are you ready?
[94:35.16]Lobster Cop.
[94:36.02]Uh-oh.
[94:44.40]It was a wink.
[94:46.70]Is it Larry?
[94:50.93]No, it's not Larry.
[94:57.04]Ah, it's the famous Frog Detective.
[95:02.36]Famous?
[95:03.80]I'm not famous.
[95:06.57]Perhaps not, but I'm sure you will be soon.
[95:08.91]Yeah, I hope so.
[95:12.49]What brings you to my office, Detective?
[95:15.27]Well, I was just leaving my office, actually.
[95:18.49]I work next door, right here.
[95:22.75]Oh, I thought that was a cupboard.
[95:26.09]That's my office.
[95:28.23]I've been putting all my cleaning supplies in there.
[95:32.07]Yes, I've noticed.
[95:33.59]I remember working every time you do it.
[95:35.29]I even say, this is my office.
[95:40.87]And then you say, sure, this is your cleaning frog.
[95:44.31]And then I say, I am a crime-solving frog, not a cleaning frog.
[95:48.09]But usually, you're gone already.
[95:57.20]Excuse my ignorance, detective.
[95:59.06]I wasn't trying to offend.
[96:02.16]Make him louder.
[96:03.06]Turn him up.
[96:05.20]Can you talk for me for a second?
[96:06.90]That needs to be a little louder.
[96:08.18]You're too quiet.
[96:09.58]Let me turn you up a little.
[96:11.66]Say something.
[96:12.24]A little bit.
[96:12.84]Say it again.
[96:25.80]How's that?
[96:26.16]Does that sound better?
[96:29.56]No, your mic is fucked up.
[96:32.54]You don't have any... Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[96:34.26]Check to see what mic you have plugged in.
[96:36.82]I think I have this one plugged.
[96:38.37]I think I'm on... It says... Why'd you check webcam microphone 920?
[96:44.77]No, no, no, no, no.
[96:45.81]Wrong mic.
[96:46.73]You have a better mic, don't you?
[96:48.87]No, I don't.
[96:50.47]You don't have a better mic.
[96:53.05]Aren't you a voice actor?
[96:55.45]But I do that stuff in the studio.
[96:56.91]I don't do it here.
[96:59.51]You don't have... You don't have a single... Let me try putting this one in.
[97:02.87]Let's see if this one's better.
[97:08.54]Hello?
[97:12.40]Is that better?
[97:12.84]Do I sound better on this one?
[97:16.18]Or should I go back to the other one?
[97:17.58]No, go back to the other one.
[97:18.84]The other one, other one, other one.
[97:21.30]How about this?
[97:22.06]Better?
[97:23.62]That's a little better.
[97:25.32]Okay, I'll do this one instead.
[97:29.52]Why do you sound so different on this one?
[97:32.08]I just picked it up on my phone.
[97:37.88]You're on Skype on the phone?
[97:41.08]Yes.
[97:43.34]Alright, fuck it.
[97:43.80]Whatever.
[97:44.22]We can't just do this all day.
[97:47.06]That's fine.
[97:47.46]I'll pump the phone through.
[97:49.22]That's fine.
[97:56.09]You know, you want to just come over?
[97:56.93]I can come over if you want.
[98:00.31]Just come over.
[98:00.79]Just come over.
[98:01.45]Like, I'll do my best impression of you as best as I fucking can.
[98:05.95]Okay, I'll be there in, like, two hours?
[98:09.07]Two, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[98:10.33]Now.
[98:10.63]Like, right now.
[98:11.63]Get here now.
[98:12.83]I don't have a car.
[98:14.27]Can you drive?
[98:14.79]Just drive here now.
[98:18.47]I'll do my best.
[98:19.09]Okay.
[98:21.35]I'll be here in two hours.
[98:22.88]Be here in fucking ten minutes.
[98:25.80]I'm getting another phone call.
[98:27.36]Who the fuck is calling me now?
[98:28.66]What?
[98:31.48]Stop.
[98:31.76]Hold on.
[98:36.01]Stop.
[98:36.47]Stop.
[98:40.59]Hello?
[98:42.03]Oh, Jeremy.
[98:43.73]I'm so glad I got to get a hold of you.
[98:45.73]It's me, Bugleberry.
[98:47.93]I heard you were looking for some voice work.
[98:49.56]You're looking for some voice actors.
[98:51.76]I can do voice work.
[98:53.36]You...
[98:56.55]Uh... Okay, you'll be here... I gotta hold the phone with my mouth.
[99:02.05]Are you... Are you gonna... When do you think you'll be here?
[99:04.29]Is he gone?
[99:05.77]Alright, he's gone.
[99:07.69]Fucking Beagleberry calling me.
[99:09.35]I hate this shit.
[99:10.61]People know I'm fucking streaming.
[99:11.95]It's so aggravating.
[99:14.39]Like, why would you call me during the middle of a stream?
[99:17.01]To, like, try to get on the stream?
[99:19.35]Like, get the fuck out of here, dude.
[99:23.66]Anyways, I'll do my best.
[99:27.71]Excuse my ignorance, detective.
[99:29.67]I wasn't trying to offend.
[99:32.33]I'm a very busy boy, a head full of mysteries.
[99:34.99]Sometimes I forget to be polite.
[99:37.07]If I was polite all the time, I would never have time to soften a... Hold on.
[99:41.41]I can do better than that.
[99:42.51]That's a better voice, right?
[99:44.03]I got a better voice than that, don't I?
[99:46.85]He's just like, oh, look at me.
[99:49.53]I understand.
[99:51.39]Maybe that's why I'm not as talented as you, lobster cop.
[99:55.48]perhaps but detective you must keep trying never give up I can give you some tips if you'd like wow yes please tip number one pay attention you should make sure you are looking at things and paying attention to words yes quite right tip number two everyone is a suspect even you
[100:25.00]I will suspect myself much more from now on.
[100:29.02]Good call, good call.
[100:30.96]Tip number three, carry a notebook.
[100:34.41]Oh, I'm not really big on books.
[100:37.55]They are without exception factually inaccurate.
[100:41.65]Detective, don't be foolish.
[100:43.57]A book you write yourself cannot be factually inaccurate if you are writing facts.
[100:48.43]I suppose you're right.
[100:50.82]I don't have a notebook though.
[100:54.41]Well, it's your lucky day.
[100:57.72]I have a spare notebook on my desk.
[100:59.94]You can decorate it and use it all you like.
[101:03.16]Wow, really?
[101:04.48]Yep.
[101:05.04]There are stickers you can use, too.
[101:07.20]I bought them all with my crime-solving money.
[101:10.54]Cool.
[101:12.06]I'll let you get to it, Detective.
[101:13.66]Head into my office when you're ready to decorate.
[101:15.72]Okay.
[101:17.44]Thanks, Lobster Cop.
[101:19.08]Thanks.
[101:20.60]Thanks, Lobster Cop.
[101:21.86]It's fucking hard to do.
[101:25.92]Hope he gets here soon.
[101:31.34]We can decorate the office?
[101:33.20]Ooh, stickers!
[101:34.72]Hmm, which sticker should I pick?
[101:37.97]And where should they go?
[101:38.77]Ooh, this is tough.
[101:45.23]This is tough.
[102:10.62]Oh, it's small.
[102:12.10]I don't...
[103:10.82]Um, that's good.
[103:17.31]Uh, no.
[103:22.07]Wait, this is kind of off.
[103:31.27]Worm dick.
[103:32.91]Alright, sorry.
[103:34.24]Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry.
[103:36.72]Sorry.
[103:37.62]Sorry for the worm dick.
[103:43.37]Done.
[103:44.61]Done.
[103:47.13]Clap for me.
[103:47.59]Clap for me.
[103:48.07]Clap for me.
[103:48.51]I fucking demand it.
[103:49.37]Clap for me.
[103:49.81]I fucking demand it.
[103:50.62]Clap for me.
[103:51.06]I fucking demand it.
[103:55.96]Got a notebook.
[104:01.86]Oh, there's a new mechanic.
[104:07.03]Notebook.
[104:07.99]Magnifier.
[104:08.67]Invisible wizard.
[104:12.53]That's a lot of pages.
[104:15.62]Notes.
[104:16.36]Number one best detective.
[104:17.40]Has lots of fans.
[104:18.30]Is super cool.
[104:18.98]So many trophies.
[104:19.60]I hope I get a trophy one day.
[104:20.78]You don't have any trophies.
[104:21.78]Liar.
[104:29.66]Yep.
[104:42.86]You can stand right here.
[104:51.08]Right in front of the mic.
[104:52.36]Right here?
[104:54.48]That's a little too close.
[104:55.63]Hold back.
[104:55.93]Okay, this way.
[104:58.11]Good.
[104:59.63]Alright, I'll get you something.
[105:00.43]You can sit down right there.
[105:01.05]That's fine.
[105:03.07]Sick!
[105:03.49]Sick!
[105:03.89]Sick!
[105:04.29]Sick!
[105:04.71]Sick!
[105:07.83]You know what to do!
[105:09.00]You know what to do, man of the hour!
[105:11.55]Say it.
[105:12.37]Say the line.
[105:12.89]You came just in time.
[105:16.58]It's time to solve an- Oh!
[105:19.36]Are you alright?
[105:21.36]Are you okay?
[105:23.22]My leg.
[105:23.86]That was my leg.
[105:25.00]I know.
[105:25.48]You alright?
[105:28.58]No, you're fine.
[105:29.22]You're fine.
[105:29.56]You okay?
[105:30.70]Yeah, I'm okay.
[105:32.14]This was slippery.
[105:32.78]Why is it so wet?
[105:35.01]Because- I sweat a lot.
[105:37.67]Ugh!
[105:39.46]Okay, it's time to solve another mystery!
[105:43.00]Did it!
[105:45.74]Does this... Does this look swollen?
[105:47.78]Uh... Yeah... Really swollen.
[105:53.78]Oh shit!
[106:06.12]Super hot, what?
[106:17.30]Are you good?
[106:18.68]I am 100% fine.
[106:20.58]Nobody worried about me.
[106:22.45]It's not swollen.
[106:23.79]I just had a full jar of peanut butter in my pocket.
[106:27.99]And it slid down to the bottom of my pants.
[106:31.51]Because I have a hole in my pants.
[106:34.86]Oh, okay.
[106:35.22]You're good.
[106:39.60]Snacking on the go.
[106:47.73]You make it worse.
[106:49.31]New characters.
[106:49.97]Hold on, we got new characters.
[106:53.95]No, he didn't shit his pants.
[107:12.45]Does Jermaink even work?
[107:13.69]What the fuck?
[107:14.29]It didn't go through?
[107:16.40]What a scam.
[107:25.97]Warlock Woods.
[107:37.79]Oh, my stars.
[107:39.52]It's you.
[107:41.32]It's me.
[107:43.00]The famous lobster cop.
[107:47.82]I really thought you'd be a lobster.
[107:50.90]I know I'm fucked.
[107:53.22]Yeah.
[107:55.08]Why is your name Lobster Cop?
[107:58.26]I have to tell you something.
[108:00.56]I'm not Lobster Cop.
[108:04.65]Why not?
[108:06.65]I don't know how to answer that.
[108:09.09]Who are you?
[108:10.75]I'm the detective.
[108:12.77]Frog detective.
[108:15.37]I see.
[108:15.77]Is Lobster Cop not available?
[108:20.10]Unfortunately not.
[108:22.06]Well, I think you'll do just fine.
[108:24.77]Thanks.
[108:26.19]I'm Susan.
[108:28.54]Hi, Susan.
[108:29.06]Hi.
[108:30.52]I'm the one that contacted the agency, which I think you'll find excludes me from being a suspect.
[108:39.00]Oh, I didn't know that's how it worked.
[108:41.50]You should know these things, detective.
[108:45.27]I'm sorry.
[108:46.85]It's okay.
[108:48.51]I think you should still question me, though.
[108:51.96]Getting into Eeyore territory, but to remove all doubt.
[108:58.02]Okay.
[108:59.66]Question me all you like.
[109:02.84]Help the wizard.
[109:03.50]You got a balloon here.
[109:05.55]Do you know the wizard?
[109:07.35]I'm sorry.
[109:07.99]I spoke before you did.
[109:10.05]Do you know the wizard personally?
[109:12.47]Nobody knows her personally.
[109:14.63]Well, not here at least.
[109:17.91]Not me.
[109:20.07]Right.
[109:21.34]But I had a lot to do with the organization of the parade.
[109:25.53]And I was the one to start the investigation.
[109:29.23]You mentioned that.
[109:31.03]Worth bringing up again.
[109:32.07]So you were fine with her moving to town?
[109:38.50]Absolutely.
[109:40.88]That old house has been empty for years, and it's really nice someone wants to live there.
[109:44.82]Needs a lot of fixing up, but it'll look nice soon, I think.
[109:50.85]Plus, it's always exciting to have a new neighbor.
[109:54.33]Sure is.
[109:57.72]I put up a sign I made for the wizard, but it got knocked down last night.
[110:02.70]Feeling pretty sad about it, if I'm honest.
[110:08.02]I know you're here to solve the mystery, but I just need to tell someone how I feel.
[110:13.19]You can talk to me about it.
[110:15.07]Thanks.
[110:16.45]I'm not a professional sign maker, but I worked really hard on that sign.
[110:20.79]Really, I struggle to understand why someone would knock it down.
[110:24.56]I feel so heartless, and now I'm not sure who to trust.
[110:30.04]I thought everyone here would be thrilled to have a new neighbor.
[110:33.74]It's a tricky situation for sure.
[110:35.92]Some people are protective of their communities and think new people are going to change things for the worse.
[110:42.26]But that's almost never the case.
[110:43.86]New people make places better because they bring new perspectives, especially in small communities.
[110:49.09]Hopefully it's just a misunderstanding or a mistake.
[110:52.51]I'd like to believe people are good.
[110:53.67]That being said, I'm treating everyone as a suspect.
[110:58.95]Not me, right?
[111:00.89]Even you, especially you.
[111:03.98]Okay, I need a hook.
[111:06.44]Small fucking enemy spider.
[111:07.96]Where?
[111:32.96]Alright, Susan.
[111:34.44]Motive.
[111:35.64]Maybe she didn't like her sign destroyed the parade out of embarrassment.
[111:38.90]Something to fix the sign.
[111:42.69]Since she's not as suspicious, this makes her much more suspicious.
[111:46.65]Upset about the parade being destroyed, worked really hard on her sign.
[111:59.30]That's how you sound like.
[112:00.46]What the...
[112:01.78]What do you, what do you sound like?
[112:04.73]What do you sound like?
[112:07.27]What do you sound like?
[112:08.61]What do you sound like?
[112:09.59]Hello, little frog.
[112:15.37]I'm Ralph.
[112:17.77]Why are you yelling?
[112:19.87]I'm just making sure you can hear me.
[112:22.81]I can hear you.
[112:24.42]You don't have to yell.
[112:26.34]You're very small.
[112:28.74]Might be difficult for you to hear.
[112:32.49]I'm small, but I'm also very close to you.
[112:35.03]Being small isn't the same as being far away.
[112:39.24]Are you sure?
[112:41.00]You can hear me at this volume?
[112:43.56]Yes.
[112:44.94]Weird.
[112:47.74]I'm the detective.
[112:48.44]I'm here to solve mystery.
[112:51.26]Really?
[112:53.42]Yes.
[112:55.16]But you're so small.
[112:58.02]I'm of average frog height.
[113:01.83]Hmm.
[113:03.63]Can I ask you some questions about Casey?
[113:06.31]Questioning me, huh?
[113:08.84]What happened to your eye?
[113:11.72]May I ask why you have an eye patch on?
[113:15.46]That's Ralph's business.
[113:18.20]Oh.
[113:19.21]It'd be really good for me to know why you have an eye patch.
[113:22.41]Sometimes a boy just wants to wear an eye patch.
[113:25.45]That shouldn't make me as suspicious.
[113:29.13]You put it on for fashion.
[113:31.78]Kind of.
[113:35.37]Detective, I don't want to get into this too much.
[113:38.54]But I watched a movie last night.
[113:41.10]About pirates.
[113:42.78]And I loved it.
[113:44.32]And there's another three left.
[113:46.46]Three whole movies.
[113:48.97]Can you believe it?
[113:51.75]Sequels?
[113:52.81]I've never heard of a movie having a sequel before.
[113:55.01]Giant enemy... I know, right?
[113:58.88]Usually sequels are reserved for video games.
[114:03.77]Yes, it's extremely normal to have a video game sequel.
[114:06.65]Especially for games with large audiences like the Toad Investigation Series.
[114:11.06]Yeah.
[114:12.08]Anyway, I was watching a pirate movie last night.
[114:14.98]That's where I was.
[114:16.62]And for that reason, I have decided to wear an eyepatch.
[114:20.12]Okay.
[114:21.78]I'll leave it at that.
[114:23.32]Why, thanks.
[114:24.66]Questioning me, huh?
[114:27.58]What about the wisdom?
[114:30.33]I can't wait till there's a wizard so I can do a fucking wizard voice.
[114:33.87]You know how that is every time.
[114:37.01]How do you feel about the wizard moving in?
[114:42.70]It's nothing against the wizard, but I've been living away.
[114:46.54]I've been living with my friend Carlos for a while now.
[114:50.20]And our space is big.
[114:51.88]But I would really like my own home.
[114:56.64]Oh.
[114:58.35]I'd been eyeing off that old house for ages.
[115:00.29]I thought maybe I'd move in one day.
[115:03.63]But the wizard got there first.
[115:07.03]I see.
[115:08.43]It's my fault, I guess.
[115:09.87]I shouldn't hold it against the wizard.
[115:12.58]Hmm.
[115:13.94]This house is twice as big as all the other houses.
[115:16.92]Maybe you could renovate it and turn it into two houses.
[115:20.54]You could split it down the middle.
[115:22.78]Or have one house upstairs and one house downstairs.
[115:26.86]Like apartment.
[115:29.02]That's a pretty cool idea.
[115:29.98]I like Carlos and everything, but I'm a private boy.
[115:34.28]I understand.
[115:36.46]I don't have any renovation supplies, though.
[115:40.75]I'll see if I can track some down for you.
[115:43.07]Thanks for your help, detective.
[115:45.09]Maybe if I do a good job, I'll get my own building, sure.
[115:49.19]I'm excited to see it.
[115:50.17]Okay.
[115:55.14]Dude, three houses.
[115:57.20]Two houses stacked on top of three houses?
[116:04.40]A motive in true pirate fashion.
[116:05.54]Wanted to cause a ruckus.
[116:06.74]Needs building supplies.
[116:10.49]Loves pirates.
[116:11.65]Eye patches cosmetic only.
[116:13.09]A private boy.
[116:14.17]Wants to renovate.
[116:15.47]Thinks I am too small.
[116:16.47]I am not.
[116:17.13]Why don't you get it out of your system now while you have a minute.
[116:25.16]Nice.
[116:34.45]What?
[116:42.34]Huh?
[116:43.72]Who are you?
[116:45.60]The detective.
[116:47.56]Oh... I thought Lobster Cop was coming.
[116:51.16]Huh?
[116:54.52]What?
[116:54.82]Did you say something about Lobster Cop?
[116:58.45]No.
[117:00.23]But I heard... Can this frog read my mind?
[117:05.06]Why are you speaking like that?
[117:07.33]Like what?
[117:10.13]Like this?
[117:11.83]Whoa.
[117:13.81]Is that what telepathy is?
[117:16.89]Can you hear this frog?
[117:19.72]You're saying everything out loud.
[117:21.44]Wow.
[117:23.36]This frog has a temper.
[117:27.00]Anyway, who are you?
[117:29.06]I'm Naughty.
[117:31.87]Okay.
[117:33.82]I'm the mayor of Warlock Woods!
[117:38.34]Okay.
[117:40.26]Did you ask me to come?
[117:42.98]No.
[117:44.12]I would have asked for Lobster Cop instead.
[117:46.72]I really need to emphasize I can hear you.
[117:49.55]Stop listening to me!
[117:51.83]Okay.
[117:52.87]Can I ask you some questions about taste?
[117:55.77]I guess so.
[117:57.23]Tell me what you want to know.
[118:01.05]How do I change your voice to something that's not as awful?
[118:05.05]Oh, okay.
[118:06.30]I'll take that as a... I'll take that criticism.
[118:09.44]Can you tell me about last night?
[118:13.54]Nothing.
[118:15.70]Oh.
[118:16.56]But I can tell you about the wizard.
[118:19.68]I know basically everything there is to know about her.
[118:22.84]That's great.
[118:24.43]First of all, she's a wizard.
[118:25.93]Uh-huh.
[118:29.73]and she get this she's invisible great and she just moved in and now we're going and and she's a wizard we're gonna take the wizards and we're gonna they'll they'll take it over all of all of them they're one percent wizards back to bernie
[118:57.54]I think you mentioned that.
[118:59.49]No, I don't think I did.
[119:01.57]He only has one voice.
[119:03.43]It's just different spectrums of Bernie.
[119:07.45]It's like this.
[119:08.15]It's like this.
[119:08.77]It's like this.
[119:09.45]It's like this.
[119:10.07]It's like this.
[119:10.75]It's like this.
[119:12.06]Everybody has to sound like Bernie Sanders.
[119:14.78]All of us.
[119:15.42]Doesn't matter what we do.
[119:16.72]Doesn't matter how close we could be to each other.
[119:18.82]We're always going to be Bernie.
[119:23.83]Right.
[119:24.03]Okay.
[119:24.91]Sorry.
[119:28.00]It's fine.
[119:30.28]Anyway, tell me what you want to know.
[119:33.75]That's a real voice.
[119:35.45]That's real.
[119:36.47]That's two hours straight of doing this.
[119:38.77]That was what that was.
[119:42.27]About the wizard.
[119:47.24]How do you feel about the wizard coming to live here?
[119:51.16]Oh, heck.
[119:51.56]How do I answer this?
[119:55.15]Well, I'm happy she's here, but that house has been empty for ages.
[120:00.53]And I didn't know she was coming, alright?
[120:03.39]Nobody told me, you see.
[120:05.20]Not Bernie.
[120:05.92]Look, oh my God, it's not Bernie.
[120:08.46]Okay, do I sound like Bernie right now?
[120:10.16]Do I sound like Bernie right now?
[120:11.96]I want to tell you something about, I want to talk about this.
[120:14.52]Do I sound like Bernie Sanders?
[120:16.64]No, I don't.
[120:17.50]My regular speaking voice, it has nothing to do with it.
[120:24.27]No.
[120:24.39]No.
[120:26.00]When I talk normally, I go from sentence to sentence, and everything is perfectly normal, as you understand, as you hear now.
[120:33.61]I have absolutely nothing in common with the way that he talks, or the way that he enunciates words.
[120:39.67]Okay?
[120:40.85]God damn it.
[120:45.55]I think so.
[120:46.49]She kind of came wrong.
[120:48.34]She's doing it on purpose.
[120:50.94]Yowowow!
[120:53.27]She kind of came at me at a weird time of night.
[120:55.68]And I, well, I thought that she was a ghost.
[120:59.28]Oh.
[121:02.06]Yeah, it was a bit messy.
[121:03.98]Oh.
[121:05.10]I tried to vacuum her up.
[121:07.30]Hmm.
[121:09.39]With a vacuum.
[121:10.75]I put it on the highest setting.
[121:13.55]Just really went to town with the vacuum.
[121:16.41]I think I really freaked her out.
[121:18.27]And now she won't come out of the house.
[121:20.91]Um.
[121:21.85]Please don't put me in jail.
[121:24.70]You're not going to jail.
[121:25.68]Jail isn't real.
[121:31.13]But you should probably apologize.
[121:34.85]Okay, sorry, detective.
[121:37.21]I mean to the wizard.
[121:38.78]Right, yeah.
[121:40.08]That's why I was helping with the parade.
[121:42.40]To apologize.
[121:44.94]But she hasn't been out of the house.
[121:46.70]Also, the parade is ruined.
[121:48.76]Offer the voice actor a beer?
[121:50.40]You want a beer?
[122:19.46]No.
[122:21.44]I offered him a beer.
[122:27.24]If only I had a rug or something to use, I could cover up the mess.
[122:30.88]But the town is in disarray.
[122:31.86]I don't have time to track one down.
[122:35.04]Oh, no.
[122:36.47]Thank you for your concern.
[122:37.49]If you happen to find anything that would work, please let me know.
[122:40.45]Will do.
[122:40.81]Do you have any more questions?
[122:43.05]Hmm.
[122:45.43]Now we need a rug.
[122:47.57]We need a rug.
[122:48.17]We need to fix the sign.
[122:49.75]We need building supplies.
[122:55.09]He's not a drunk like some people.
[122:57.79]Is that a shot at me?
[123:02.15]What are you talking about?
[123:03.06]I haven't had a drink of alcohol in like two weeks.
[123:07.88]What are you talking about?
[123:09.14]I drink alcohol like once every two months.
[123:15.02]Maybe.
[123:17.22]He's sloshed.
[123:18.16]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[123:21.22]Alright.
[123:25.96]Okay.
[123:29.54]A customer.
[123:47.75]Welcome to the Carlos All Things You Could Need shop.
[123:51.91]Are you Carlos?
[123:53.61]Yes.
[123:54.51]Just like the name of the shop, that's me.
[123:58.27]How cool is that?
[124:00.21]The shop has my name on it.
[124:03.47]So cool.
[124:05.13]My company also has my name on it.
[124:07.93]What's your company called?
[124:10.33]Frog Detective Crime Solving Agency.
[124:13.29]What's your name?
[124:14.23]Crime?
[124:14.77]Oh, no.
[124:18.11]I'm the Frog Detective.
[124:20.23]That's not really a name, though.
[124:21.91]More of a title.
[124:24.37]Oh, I suppose you're right.
[124:26.29]My shop actually has my name in it.
[124:31.07]Cool.
[124:31.39]I'm jealous.
[124:32.99]Thanks.
[124:34.39]Here in Warlock Woods, we are all our own biggest fans.
[124:39.18]Being conceited is a societal construct.
[124:42.74]We have rejected it.
[124:44.60]Hence why my shop is so popular.
[124:47.46]I sell portraits, among other things.
[124:51.18]Wow, that's great.
[124:53.15]My office neighbor, Lobster Cop, has a picture of himself right above his desk.
[124:58.75]You know Lobster Cop?
[125:01.35]Yep.
[125:02.47]Holy heck.
[125:03.89]I've been a fan forever.
[125:05.97]You know he solved the mystery of the Haunted Island recently?
[125:11.48]I don't think so.
[125:14.33]It was actually me I did that.
[125:15.71]That was me.
[125:17.29]Wait, really?
[125:18.99]It was all over TV.
[125:20.21]The dance competition had a lobster in it.
[125:23.95]Oh, you must be thinking of Larry.
[125:26.13]You mean small Larry?
[125:27.89]No, this was a regular-sized lobster.
[125:31.89]Uh, no.
[125:33.29]Larry's regular-sized lobster.
[125:36.79]About the Larry I know.
[125:38.53]Oh, well.
[125:39.65]Agree to disagree.
[125:42.83]I really did solve that mystery.
[125:44.17]It was me, detective.
[125:47.31]That's really cool.
[125:50.13]Thanks.
[125:51.68]So you're like the second best detective, I suppose?
[125:56.44]Yeah.
[125:56.86]Did somebody just put a Jerm of Pluto with bloody nose?
[126:01.70]Oh, no, no.
[126:02.34]What?
[126:04.38]Yeah.
[126:05.26]Do you mind if I ask you some questions?
[126:06.90]Okay.
[126:07.94]What would you like to know?
[126:09.00]Fucking Bernie.
[126:11.32]What do you need?
[126:13.04]Alright, it's over.
[126:15.54]I gotta stop to read now, normally.
[126:18.10]You can go home now.
[126:19.47]Are you sure?
[126:20.11]Yeah, get out of here.
[126:21.09]Get out of here, because I can't pretend to be three, five, eight people anymore.
[126:26.79]I'm staying.
[126:27.65]Okay, you can stay.
[126:30.13]Just here in my shop.
[126:32.29]What about when you closed up?
[126:36.09]My shop doesn't close.
[126:38.05]My shop doesn't close.
[126:40.23]It's 24 hours.
[126:43.62]Time to close.
[126:44.48]Ah, fucking I'm doing it again.
[126:46.06]What if someone needs a portrait of themselves at 4 a.m.?
[126:51.13]You're open all the time?
[126:53.85]Sure am.
[126:56.33]Of course, I sleep and eat and look after myself.
[126:59.65]My customers simply wake me if they need to buy something.
[127:03.81]Where do you sleep?
[127:05.25]I sleep standing up.
[127:06.89]Here's the training.
[127:08.62]I'm the most committed shopkeeper in all of Warlockwoods.
[127:12.49]Also, the only shopkeeper in all of Warlock Woods.
[127:16.50]I'm the only one, Froggy.
[127:17.88]Do you ever take breaks?
[127:20.98]Sometimes, but I really like it here in my shop.
[127:23.82]It's where I feel most at home.
[127:26.60]The extreme shopkeeper lifestyle isn't for everyone, but I take so much joy from my work.
[127:32.25]Me too.
[127:33.61]Although, I must request that you look after yourself and close the shop if you need a break.
[127:38.93]Okay, I promise.
[127:41.21]Anyway...
[127:42.47]Did you say anything last night?
[127:47.36]Nothing particularly interesting.
[127:48.66]Why?
[127:48.92]Uh, she's crying.
[127:54.10]Huh?
[127:56.70]Hmm.
[128:00.29]I think I need to question you a bit more.
[128:01.61]Go for it.
[128:03.63]What would you like to know?
[128:05.63]Why do they always pause and go like, huh?
[128:06.99]What do you want?
[128:08.03]Huh?
[128:08.83]Huh?
[128:09.31]Huh?
[128:17.42]Is he okay?
[128:19.87]Are you okay?
[128:27.07]He swallowed an almond.
[128:28.89]He's alright.
[128:33.31]What do you know about the new wizard that just moved in?
[128:37.80]Uh, who?
[128:39.30]The invisible wizard that moved in literally next door.
[128:42.50]Wait, really?
[128:43.22]Somebody moved in?
[128:45.64]Yeah.
[128:47.08]That place has been empty for ages.
[128:49.47]I gotta say hi.
[128:51.57]Oh, the parade was meant to be for saying hi.
[128:54.33]Get him some water.
[128:55.45]He needs some... Parade.
[129:00.30]Parade.
[129:02.02]The parade that everyone has been prepping for.
[129:03.98]Oh, he's been working so hard.
[129:05.30]He needs the water.
[129:06.30]He's been working so hard.
[129:07.52]He needs the water, doesn't he?
[129:11.83]Get this guy a water.
[129:16.05]Do you want a water?
[129:16.75]Or do you want a beer?
[129:19.57]I want a beer.
[129:22.24]God, beer.
[129:23.18]Wow, how nice.
[129:28.58]Can't wait.
[129:30.14]It was destroyed last night.
[129:32.39]What?
[129:33.85]This conversation is a roller coaster of information.
[129:37.15]I have literally no idea what's happening.
[129:40.13]You weren't involved in the decoration... You okay?
[129:44.76]You gonna be alright?
[129:46.78]Yes, I'm fine.
[129:48.88]You weren't involved in the decoration at all?
[129:50.42]Nope.
[129:54.00]Should I offer to help now?
[129:56.94]Wait, who is... He needs a break.
[130:01.16]God.
[130:11.22]He's like, what did you do?
[130:13.02]Before you came over here, what did you eat?
[130:14.36]Like, eat a bunch of shellfish?
[130:16.84]Are you, like, allergic to something?
[130:19.04]Jesus Christ.
[130:26.33]He's not.
[130:26.77]He's not.
[130:27.31]No, he's not.
[130:28.51]He's, well, how old are you?
[130:29.83]Alright.
[130:30.35]Alright.
[130:30.63]Let's go.
[130:31.33]Let's go.
[130:31.79]Let's go.
[130:32.21]Let's go.
[130:33.11]No, it's for the invisible wizard.
[130:34.89]She just moved it next door.
[130:38.24]People are saying he's not old enough to work.
[130:41.35]Yes, it's like 38.
[130:46.63]Why am I asking an imaginary person if they're old enough to be working for me?
[130:53.79]No!
[130:54.66]I'm done.
[130:56.66]Oh dear.
[130:58.02]The party hats.
[131:00.16]Pardon?
[131:02.36]Every time we throw a parade, everyone has a party hat.
[131:07.43]Mine was ruined at the last parade.
[131:09.21]He is real.
[131:09.81]I know.
[131:12.09]I've been too busy working in my shop to buy a new one.
[131:15.84]Oh, no.
[131:17.10]How embarrassing.
[131:18.00]I can't show up to the parade without one.
[131:20.10]You think it's too late to order one online?
[131:22.68]It'll be tight.
[131:25.24]You're right.
[131:26.10]What should I do?
[131:27.86]Don't stress.
[131:29.02]I'll track one down for you before the parade starts.
[131:35.16]Oh, my gosh.
[131:37.10]Ow, my fucking stomach.
[131:39.68]Oh, this is fucking... This is killing me.
[131:43.58]Everyone's gonna point it out now.
[131:45.20]Oh my gosh, thank you, detective.
[131:46.60]In the meantime, I'll figure out a way to repay you.
[131:48.82]Unfortunately, I don't have any frog portraits just yet.
[131:52.84]Not a problem.
[131:54.86]What would you like to know?
[131:56.52]That's all.
[132:06.46]Careful, can you please check on their leg?
[132:19.24]This is so fucked up.
[132:28.64]Okay, we have two or three more characters to introduce.
[132:33.15]And they're all gonna have normal ass voices, by the way.
[132:38.69]You're the detective, right?
[132:40.35]I'm Mandy.
[132:40.81]Hi Mandy.
[132:43.05]Be careful where you step, Detective.
[132:45.17]There is mess everywhere.
[132:47.31]I'm used to mess.
[132:49.19]Lucky you, I'm not.
[132:51.25]My shoes are brand new.
[132:52.75]I can't get them dirty.
[132:54.79]Why don't you change shoes?
[132:58.19]Detective, are you joking?
[133:02.64]I can't wear flats with this look.
[133:05.26]The proportions would be all wrong.
[133:08.06]Besides, these shoes are enchanted.
[133:09.94]Oh.
[133:12.56]I'm one of the few actual witches here in Warlock Woods.
[133:16.40]Most folks here are just fans of the spooky.
[133:19.24]Which is fine and all, but it means a lot of the cleaning work will be mine to do.
[133:24.34]I never should have learned that tidying up spell.
[133:28.48]It shouldn't take too long for me to clean up this mess, but first I need to find all my pies.
[133:33.65]Why haven't you pies?
[133:35.61]Same thing that happened everywhere.
[133:36.89]Someone thought it'd be funny to knock them all over.
[133:39.19]Vandals!
[133:40.59]So annoying.
[133:41.41]I spent ages making them.
[133:44.81]Oh, I see.
[133:47.39]Well, do you mind if I ask you some questions?
[133:50.73]Tell me what you want to know.
[133:53.65]About your pies.
[133:56.91]Do you need help finding your pies?
[133:59.35]Yes!
[134:00.39]Detective, seriously, I seriously need help.
[134:03.67]Straight up, I can't see anything right now.
[134:06.49]These glasses are so dark it's unreal.
[134:09.92]I'm such a dingus.
[134:14.20]I'm such a dingus.
[134:18.48]Holy fuck.
[134:19.52]That's nice.
[134:21.52]Nice.
[134:22.10]That's a cool... Nobody says that.
[134:30.24]This town is literally cloaked in eternal night.
[134:32.48]I do.
[134:36.34]I do.
[134:38.45]No, you don't.
[134:39.69]I do.
[134:40.49]That's my thing.
[134:42.07]No, that's my thing.
[134:42.93]Don't stop talking about other, like, people that say that.
[134:44.69]That's my thing.
[134:45.23]It's a Jerma985 channel thing.
[134:46.45]It's my thing.
[134:46.95]Don't stop talking about other people that do that.
[134:49.34]It's my thing.
[134:51.60]Oh, this person does it too.
[134:52.60]No, it's my thing.
[134:53.72]They don't do it.
[134:54.08]They can't do it.
[134:55.72]Why do I think sunglasses would be a good idea?
[134:58.28]They weren't a good idea.
[135:00.14]However, I don't regret it.
[135:02.24]They make me look amazing.
[135:04.05]You think I look amazing?
[135:06.91]Thanks.
[135:07.29]I do too.
[135:08.55]Worst purchase I've ever made in terms of practicality, but it brings this look to a new level.
[135:13.95]I may be a dingus, but I'm very stylish dingus.
[135:19.26]Mm-hmm.
[135:21.34]What were we talking about?
[135:23.40]My outfit.
[135:24.70]No, no, no.
[135:25.12]Before that.
[135:27.40]Pies.
[135:28.90]Right.
[135:29.12]You offered to help pick up my pies.
[135:31.87]I'm missing quite a few.
[135:33.92]If you could bring them to me, I'd be happy to clean them up all up and give you one as payment.
[135:38.34]Pie.
[135:39.22]Okay, so... Sounds like fun.
[135:43.38]Neat!
[135:43.68]Thanks, detective!
[135:44.52]Tell me what you want to know.
[135:45.53]I need a pie.
[135:49.51]Alright, so we're gonna... There's another circle here.
[135:56.05]Mandy needs help finding her five pies.
[135:59.76]Okay, we can just run around and find them, right?
[136:04.30]I'm gonna knock them over.
[136:05.94]Scold me about fashion fair enough real.
[136:08.97]Ask her about the wisdom.
[136:10.25]Alright.
[136:16.35]Uh... Wait.
[136:17.21]Can I?
[136:19.33]Where were you last night?
[136:21.21]Doing heaps of push-ups and getting ripped.
[136:23.28]Just kidding.
[136:24.16]I was on wizbay.net.
[136:26.36]Where magic happens, TM.
[136:28.72]What were you doing?
[136:30.28]Bidding on some new shoes.
[136:32.38]Oh, you just got those ones.
[136:34.48]Yeah, but the ones I was bidding on would go super well with this blue dress I have.
[136:39.74]Wow, cool.
[136:41.31]I know.
[136:42.43]I didn't win, though.
[136:44.19]Who got Chewie?
[136:46.09]Not sure.
[136:46.51]All I know is their screen name.
[136:48.07]Someone called DizzyWizzy109.
[136:52.17]Sorry to hear it.
[136:54.19]How did you feel when you lost?
[136:57.99]A bit defeated, I went for a midnight stroll to cool off.
[137:01.77]But then I saw someone in the distance.
[137:03.87]It was a pretty froggy night, so I couldn't see much, but they were carrying a large box.
[137:11.51]I couldn't see what they looked like, but they definitely weren't from here.
[137:15.07]It felt like they were waiting for someone.
[137:17.69]I didn't think too much of it and went home.
[137:18.97]Hmm.
[137:21.88]Did you hear any noise after that?
[137:24.86]No, my house is soundproof.
[137:26.87]Ever since Mary has taken up singing, it's kind of a necessity around here.
[137:30.53]I only saw the mess in the morning.
[137:32.65]Interesting.
[137:34.61]Tell me what you want to know.
[137:37.47]Alright.
[137:38.73]Fucking easy.
[137:40.42]This is gonna be fucking easy.
[137:45.18]Oh, look.
[137:45.54]DizzyWizzy109 is in chat.
[137:46.52]Nice.
[137:46.72]Alright, we're gonna find somebody with that screen name.
[137:59.07]Is this the last person?
[138:00.13]This is it, right?
[138:01.11]Where's the, uh... Alright, what do we got here?
[138:06.60]Let me, like, take... Ooh!
[138:10.96]Lost pie!
[138:11.64]I got a lost pie.
[138:14.95]Nice.
[138:16.47]I need five of these?
[138:20.70]I have not absorbed a single piece of information this game has ever put forth.
[138:23.48]I know.
[138:24.00]And that's my fault.
[138:25.65]Because I've just been fucking all this up with voices and stuff.
[138:29.07]And you can't even pay attention.
[138:30.09]I'm sorry about that.
[138:30.69]I have no idea what's going on.
[138:32.03]This is the only task I remembered.
[138:39.23]Two pies.
[138:40.55]Oh.
[138:46.39]A reindeer.
[138:48.49]A reindeer.
[138:50.69]Reindeer.
[138:56.61]Hi!
[138:58.07]Hello.
[138:59.37]Wanna hop in?
[139:00.06]A little bit.
[139:04.60]But I'm on a case.
[139:06.80]Oh, cool.
[139:08.14]I'm Victor.
[139:08.74]Who are you?
[139:10.87]A detective.
[139:12.75]Is that your real name?
[139:15.49]Maybe.
[139:17.23]Cool, cool, cool.
[139:18.29]Are you here to question me and investigate stuff?
[139:20.75]Because, like, I'm not suspicious.
[139:22.17]How do you know you're not suspicious?
[139:28.63]Well, I think I didn't do it.
[139:33.35]You think?
[139:35.06]Yeah, nobody knows anything for certain these days.
[139:42.56]So why are you here swimming?
[139:44.90]I'm visiting my friend Naughty.
[139:48.54]Oh.
[139:50.18]She's the only person I know with a hot tub.
[139:52.35]She's the only person I know with a hot tub.
[139:53.93]Remember the fucking voice from last one?
[139:57.91]I heard they were going to be delicious pies for the parade.
[140:00.32]The timing was perfect.
[140:03.46]YouTuber?
[140:08.52]carry no just because I opened it up with like uh hello do not just because I did like that was a Jim carrey it was alright but just because I did that doesn't mean the character is Jim carrey where do you live normally over near pumpkinville nice spot I was thinking of taking a holiday there at some point yeah it's fine yeah
[140:37.69]Um, so, uh, can I ask you a question about anything?
[140:40.93]Yeah, whatever.
[140:42.47]Auto-free questions.
[140:44.01]Alright, what'd you do last night?
[140:45.81]Do you need anything?
[140:50.32]Where were you when the parade was destroyed?
[140:53.52]Well, I had been swimming all day in Naughty's hot tub, so I was super wrinkly.
[140:58.58]Yep.
[140:59.96]And it was hard for me to get inside the house because of my wrinkly hooves.
[141:03.52]Uh-huh.
[141:06.17]So I waited for about a half an hour for the wrinkles to de-wrinkle.
[141:11.54]Yep.
[141:12.86]And then I went inside to Naughty's house and snoozed on the couch all night.
[141:18.66]What time was that?
[141:20.62]All night.
[141:22.06]No, I mean... What time?
[141:27.08]That is not the time.
[141:27.76]What time do you close?
[141:28.79]What time do you get back into the house?
[141:31.47]I gotta stop doing that.
[141:32.41]I gotta stop fucking... I can't do No Country for Old Men every half day.
[141:37.93]Before the parade was destroyed, it wasn't me.
[141:42.72]Probably wasn't me, I mean.
[141:45.22]Can't be sure.
[141:47.34]But 90% probability that it wasn't me.
[141:50.84]Questions, you have them.
[141:58.13]Stop talking in voices, for fuck's sake.
[142:01.21]Stop talking in voices, for fuck's sake.
[142:16.74]Did you know about the invisible wizard before you get... What if I started going even louder and worse?
[142:27.52]Eh, not really.
[142:28.22]I knew the parade was for her, but beyond that, I know a lot.
[142:32.12]I'm begging you do that.
[142:36.34]Talking tongues.
[142:43.00]Just going nuts.
[142:46.10]I think a lot more people would leave if I did that one.
[142:50.72]Annoying that they never threw a parade for me coming to visit.
[142:53.74]Hmm?
[142:55.10]I'm super cool.
[142:57.22]Have you been here before?
[142:59.52]So many times.
[143:00.38]The first time they even threw me a parade.
[143:05.54]Okay.
[143:06.79]I take the parade thing back.
[143:09.37]Just pretend I didn't say that.
[143:11.83]Sure.
[143:13.49]Find somebody else to watch.
[143:40.83]But probably don't tell them.
[143:41.97]It would hurt their feelings.
[143:49.22]I didn't hurt your feelings though, did I?
[143:51.88]Well, I have to admit I was a bit hurt.
[143:55.20]I have a very exciting job and I'm a frog.
[143:57.12]I like to solve mysteries.
[144:01.61]I don't think I'm boring at all.
[144:05.09]Wow, Jerma was hired to voice act this entire game?
[144:07.77]Yeah, dude.
[144:09.01]Yeah.
[144:10.46]I'm full of energy today, if you couldn't tell.
[144:12.60]This game sucks.
[144:16.98]Alright, actually ban that person for five minutes.
[144:21.02]I want them to sit there and think about it.
[144:22.58]Just be like... And then they can talk again.
[144:31.71]Plus, I've solved my fair share of crimes.
[144:33.99]What crimes?
[144:35.05]This one.
[144:38.92]You solved the crime already?
[144:41.20]Yeah, Ralph did it.
[144:43.32]How do you know?
[144:47.71]Good point.
[144:49.01]I haven't decided that bit yet.
[144:50.89]But it seems likely that he did.
[144:52.05]What was his motive?
[144:55.31]His what?
[144:57.43]Motive.
[144:57.73]The reason for destroying something.
[145:00.55]Oh, I think it's because he has an eyepatch on.
[145:06.79]This is a great stream.
[145:07.75]You guys are smoking crack.
[145:09.37]You guys are smoking crack.
[145:28.98]You guys are smoking.
[145:31.51]Don't smoke crack.
[145:32.71]It's not good for you.
[145:36.81]I don't think that's a motive.
[145:37.99]That doesn't make any sense.
[145:39.77]Wow, who's the rude one?
[145:41.45]This conversation... I'm just... Let's go.
[145:45.43]We're just sitting here going back and forth saying the same three sentences.
[145:51.48]I mean it.
[145:52.20]I just get so grumpy when I'm hungry.
[145:53.94]Why don't you eat something and get out of the hot tub?
[145:56.32]No, I just... I must continue to soak.
[145:59.08]You could ask someone to get you something to eat.
[146:01.14]Like who?
[146:02.38]There's nobody here.
[146:04.82]I am here.
[146:05.26]I have to get him something to eat.
[146:06.76]Right.
[146:07.08]There.
[146:07.40]I go being rude again.
[146:08.34]If you happen to find food, I would love to have some.
[146:12.04]In the meantime, I would like to apologize for being so rude.
[146:14.60]Please take one money as an apology.
[146:18.70]Nice.
[146:25.20]Wait.
[146:25.42]Give item?
[146:26.44]Lost.
[146:26.70]Should I give him a pie?
[146:32.85]Is this... Should I not give him a pie?
[146:35.09]No, no, no, no.
[146:41.04]No, he doesn't deserve it.
[146:43.74]He doesn't deserve it.
[146:46.64]No, it's not.
[146:47.26]It's not your pie.
[146:51.32]Am I gonna give this pie back that was on the ground, and then this person's gonna sell it for money, and the person's gonna eat something that was on the ground?
[146:59.64]Very rude.
[147:03.50]Rude because of hunger.
[147:04.90]Maybe just rude in general.
[147:05.80]Doesn't live here.
[147:06.54]Okay.
[147:10.83]Smoking crack.
[147:15.65]Alright, we got... How many pies do we need?
[147:16.75]We need five.
[147:17.97]What do I have?
[147:18.33]Two?
[147:19.41]How much does this stuff cost in the store?
[147:21.63]That's too expensive.
[147:22.19]How am I going to ever afford this stuff?
[147:25.13]Six dollars for a sheep?
[147:29.32]Hello, wizard.
[147:30.04]Alright, I haven't talked to you.
[147:52.75]Hello?
[147:57.20]Hello, frog!
[148:00.74]That was there.
[148:01.68]That was a fucking softball.
[148:05.80]Hello, what's your name?
[148:07.68]I'm Mary.
[148:09.16]Nice to meet you.
[148:09.70]Same person.
[148:10.96]Nice to meet you.
[148:12.78]You too.
[148:13.80]Did you like my song?
[148:15.94]Yep.
[148:17.18]I've been practicing all day and all night.
[148:20.24]Oh, are you okay?
[148:23.28]He's getting embarrassed from this.
[148:31.38]Turn on... Turn on mic distortion for one of these?
[148:34.50]Alright, fine.
[148:39.58]Uh-uh.
[148:40.82]Uh-uh.
[148:42.43]Uh-uh.

[148:47.40]Okay.
[148:48.56]I guess it's... How's this one sound?
[148:50.84]Yeah, this is a pretty good sounding one.
[148:53.82]Not a bad one.
[148:56.44]Okay.
[148:58.67]I'm tired.
[148:59.47]Hmm.
[149:02.01]Maybe you should get some sleep.

[149:07.33]You sing very loudly.
[149:09.79]Yep.
[149:11.23]I'm why everyone soundproof their houses.
[149:15.42]That sounds expensive.
[149:18.24]Yeah, but that's not really my problem.
[149:22.61]I think I sound very good even late at night.
[149:26.73]How late?
[149:28.89]I love to sing at 3 a.m.
[149:33.62]Wow.
[149:35.74]That's when my energy is the highest.
[149:39.02]That doesn't sound very healthy.
[149:41.92]My health is my business.
[149:44.42]Oh, yeah, that's true.
[149:46.54]sorry that's okay maybe I should listen to some soft sounds before bed welcome to my hair salon that will be 100 money just joking anyway who are you I'm the detective oh cool can you question me

[150:40.78]Oh.
[150:41.94]Yeah, there's a wizard.
[150:43.74]She just moved in.
[150:45.90]Why?
[150:47.62]I'm a detective.
[150:49.18]Right.

[150:52.80]Yes.
[150:54.60]Cool, cool.
[150:56.12]Uh, so, I didn't do any crimes or anything.
[150:59.65]And I have the right to remain silent.
[151:02.65]Yeah, but did you want to remain silent?
[151:07.28]literally never so like I heard that Ralph was super weird about the new wizard moving in also I heard that mandy was in a bad mood the night the parade was destroyed and I heard that naughty like attacked the wizard one time and that's all actually
[151:35.24]Does this make me a snitch?
[151:38.12]I think so.
[151:39.80]Rats.
[151:41.68]Oh boy, I love questions.
[151:48.69]What were you doing when the parade was destroyed?
[151:50.67]Oh boy, yeah.
[151:55.52]Sucks that the parade was destroyed.
[152:00.86]We're doing questioning.

[152:04.34]Not much.
[152:05.42]Just singing outside.
[152:10.55]You were outside when the parade was destroyed?
[152:13.71]Yeah.
[152:16.09]Did you see anything?
[152:18.45]Yeah.
[152:20.41]What did you see?
[152:20.99]Detective, have you heard of extortion?
[152:27.81]Yes.
[152:29.59]That's great news.
[152:33.18]Is it?
[152:35.30]Detective, I would like to extort you.
[152:40.82]I don't think that's legal.
[152:44.66]I am above the law.
[152:49.16]Oh.
[152:50.70]Why are you extorting me?
[152:51.88]I would like five money.
[152:56.68]For a train ticket.
[153:01.11]I don't have any money.
[153:04.57]Well, you best get some soon.
[153:08.75]It was her.
[153:10.09]It was her.
[153:11.29]It was her.
[153:11.83]She did it.

[153:40.65]I wanna go to Froggywood and become a star.
[153:44.95]Oh, that sounds exciting.
[153:46.46]I know, right?
[153:47.60]Sorry about the extortion thing, but I don't really have many other ways to get there.
[153:52.08]I figure if you get the money from me, I can finally go and live my dreams.
[153:58.17]Do I have to do this?
[154:06.88]I'm not doing that.
[154:08.50]What will you give me in exchange?

[156:26.55]Hurry up and investigate.
[156:27.53]What the fuck do you think I'm doing?

[157:33.99]There's nothing in the water.
[157:49.18]Found one.
[157:51.42]It's a lost pie.
[157:52.04]I need one more.
[157:53.24]There's a huge deer in the water.
[157:54.82]I can see the deer in the water.
[158:00.22]Yeah, I know.
[158:00.74]That's a little strange.
[158:04.52]One more pie, and then we can do a turn-in.
[158:08.61]Can I take the balloon?
[158:12.85]Got it.
[158:14.41]Bingo.
[158:17.31]Alright, let's do the turn-in.
[158:22.71]Five lost pies.
[158:27.42]Streams like this are why I need a therapist.
[158:31.34]What?
[158:31.52]Alright, what do you want?
[158:39.97]Uh, here are your pies.
[158:41.83]All five of them.
[158:44.71]Well, all of them?
[158:46.15]I think so.
[158:47.47]Yeah, that looks like all of them.
[158:48.49]Wow, you must have searched far and wide.
[158:52.32]Yes.
[158:53.60]Wowee.
[158:54.12]Thanks, detective.
[158:55.96]Show this stream to the doctor.
[158:59.24]You mean you're going to show this stream to your doctor and say, something's wrong with me.
[159:05.08]I got something wrong with me here.
[159:08.27]Not me.
[159:08.87]I don't show this one to my doctor.
[159:14.59]Here's one money.
[159:16.33]That's it?
[159:22.32]You didn't promise pay- Wait, why one?
[159:24.66]I gave you five pies.
[159:28.96]Oh, I'm not- Okay.
[159:30.04]I'm not very hungry.
[159:30.66]You can hold on to it.
[159:31.46]What?
[159:32.50]Nonsense.
[159:32.96]Take one and eat it later when you're hungry.
[159:34.42]Alright, now we give the pie to the... Elk?
[159:39.78]Got a pie.
[159:40.48]Pie to the elk.
[159:41.84]Elk gets out of the water.
[159:48.98]That's a good deal.
[159:49.90]One dollar for five pies.
[159:53.02]Done.
[160:01.39]No, my doctor would probably shout bald at me then subscribe to you.
[160:07.33]What?
[160:12.44]I've got something for you.
[160:15.12]Questions.
[160:17.20]Take a pie.
[160:18.74]That's real and true.
[160:21.55]Are you still hungry?
[160:22.63]Yes, very.
[160:23.19]It's making me really rude.
[160:24.53]For example, I think your jumper is outdated.
[160:27.52]Victor, I'm not the most fashionable frog in the world, but I like this jumper.
[160:32.20]It's my favorite.
[160:33.66]You're right.
[160:34.06]It's retro, not outdated.
[160:35.46]I'm simply very hungry.
[160:37.84]Here is a pie.
[160:39.87]Seriously?
[160:40.37]Score!
[160:41.49]Yep, please enjoy it.
[160:43.37]Oh my gosh, that was amazing.
[160:44.67]And I feel so much less rude now.
[160:48.25]Really?
[160:48.97]Yep.
[160:50.09]You have beautiful eyes.
[160:52.01]Oh, wow.
[160:52.39]Thank you.
[160:53.70]It's true.
[160:54.76]And I think that color jumper suits you perfectly.
[160:57.92]You're making me blush.
[160:59.66]I should give you something in return for this pie.
[161:01.68]Hmm.
[161:02.84]I have a spare party hat I'm not using.
[161:04.90]Maybe you could wear it.
[161:06.74]Alas, my head is simply too weird.
[161:09.68]Well, hold on to it anyways.
[161:10.73]It might come in handy.
[161:13.01]Thanks.
[161:13.27]Alright, I got a party hat.
[161:16.57]Party hat's for... Somebody wanted one of these, right?
[161:19.65]Who wanted the party hat?
[161:22.07]Can you please call Bugleberry again?
[161:23.45]No, I fucking blocked him.
[161:25.60]I blocked his number.
[161:30.06]Bugleberry is worse than a telemarketer.
[161:32.70]I get more calls in the middle of dinner from Bugleberry than I do from people trying to sell me shit.
[161:41.08]Or take a survey.
[161:41.96]Alright, who wanted the party hat?
[161:45.59]Not you.
[161:47.05]You?
[161:49.35]You wanted supplies.
[161:51.65]You want a party hat?
[161:52.31]Who wants a party hat?
[161:58.62]Needs something to fix her sign.
[162:01.28]Wants supplies.
[162:03.66]Wants a rug.
[162:08.40]Carlos wants a party hat.
[162:11.90]Paul Bugleberry.
[162:12.62]He's crying.
[162:14.76]He's not crying.
[162:20.11]What would you like to know?
[162:22.37]I have a party hat for you.
[162:26.49]Carlos, I have something for you.
[162:28.53]No way.
[162:29.90]It's a party hat.
[162:31.56]No way.
[162:33.00]Yes way.
[162:34.28]That's epic.
[162:36.12]That's honestly the most epic thing I've heard all day.
[162:39.08]Thanks, detective.
[162:44.02]Hold on.
[162:44.66]Sorry.
[162:47.20]When the word epic was said like four times in a row, I got a headache.
[162:52.63]Not a problem.
[162:54.07]Incorrect, it was a problem.
[162:56.01]And you solved it.
[162:57.47]Just like a true detective.
[163:00.35]Aw, thanks.
[163:01.87]You've made a fan out of me.
[163:04.05]Here, let me pay you for your work.
[163:06.19]Oh, no, that's okay.
[163:07.91]Detective, I insist you take a payment.
[163:10.11]One money should do it.
[163:13.57]Fuck.
[163:15.55]Three dollars?
[163:17.99]Carlos just subscribed.
[163:19.53]Thanks for the sub, Carlos.
[163:20.87]Appreciate it.
[163:24.76]Thanks for the sub.
[163:26.45]Welcome to the stream.
[163:28.31]Oh, I also found this rug out back.
[163:29.81]Not sure what it was for, but I figured you're good at solving these puzzles.
[163:32.67]Alright, now we got a rug.
[163:35.91]Read his sub message.
[163:39.03]I just did.
[163:46.26]Bugleberry just messaged me on aim.
[163:48.16]He's coming over.
[163:50.34]Don't let Bugleberry over your house.
[163:53.46]He's never going to leave.
[163:55.44]He'll find excuses to stay.
[163:59.80]He'll be there for four hours, sitting there watching TV, and you'll... You know that he's not going to leave anytime soon, but you want him to leave, but there's no reason for him to leave.
[164:09.96]Because you said it was okay for him to come over.
[164:12.08]So you're sitting on the couch, both just watching fucking random videos or YouTube videos or TV shows.
[164:17.96]It's like... We're not doing anything.
[164:21.38]We're not going anywhere.
[164:22.30]I don't want you to be here anymore, but I don't have a reason to make you leave.
[164:27.05]And then, out of nowhere, you're hoping you don't hear it, but you do.
[164:32.09]Oh, uh, oh, hey, uh, you hungry?
[164:35.51]Oh, let's order some food!
[164:37.57]And it's like, oh, that's at least another fucking 30 minutes before the food to get here.
[164:42.19]And now you're gonna be here for like an hour, there's two hours now.
[164:45.37]Or we're gonna go somewhere instead.
[164:46.33]I don't wanna pay, I don't wanna do that right now.
[164:47.93]I'm gonna get tuna sandwich in the fridge.
[164:50.92]Uh, no, I'm all good, I'm good, I'm good, I don't want food.
[164:53.92]Oh, what was the last time you ate?
[164:56.76]Fuck, okay.
[164:57.86]You've been here for four hours, so you know.
[164:59.94]It's been at least probably six hours.
[165:01.60]I'm not hungry.
[165:03.00]Really?
[165:06.90]That was a real wink?
[165:07.70]Alright, rug.

[166:12.97]They're in a fish tank anyway.
[166:16.35]Why?
[166:18.02]One guess.
[166:19.92]They're a fish.
[166:22.26]Bingo.
[166:24.27]Wait, do you mean to tell me you got the most famous band of all time, the Market Buddies?

[167:11.00]I better get back to work.
[167:13.30]Did I get any money?
[167:15.06]Before you go, I should give you something in return.
[167:16.48]One dollar.
[167:20.41]I have some building supplies left over from when I made the stage.
[167:22.97]Is that enough?
[167:24.15]Yeah, thank you.
[167:25.37]Real wink.
[167:30.76]So this is if a real wink comes in, I just stare.
[167:33.06]And then people realize, oh no, no, no.
[167:38.04]Oh my God, oh my God, they're worthless.
[167:39.71]Oh my God, now they're not.
[167:40.71]Now I can't even get a wink for buying a wink.
[167:44.66]And this is... Now I go... This is when, like, I go to court and shit.

[168:26.26]I think that's just a coincidence of you not going to the dentist for 10 years.
[168:30.06]It... It happened now.
[168:32.92]Like, your teeth started... It had nothing to do with me.
[168:44.21]I hear the supplies.
[168:49.06]The wink is a scam.
[168:50.30]Dump it.
[168:50.70]Dump all your points.
[168:52.86]Dump all points.
[168:53.78]Invest in highlights.

[168:56.64]You guys are just throwing it all away.
[169:01.43]Oh, great.
[169:05.89]What exciting news.
[169:07.33]I'd love to use them if you're okay to hand them over.

[169:37.27]Got one money.
[169:39.37]Thank you.
[169:40.47]Also, I think you've earned yourself the title of Honorary Pirate.
[169:44.26]wow really me a pirate yes you have the treasure collecting skills of the finest pirate this I must award you a special prize here take this hook got a hook the hook goes over here we did this all in a row in 10 seconds why am I not reading highlighted messages because there's a million of them but wait when did I say that I read out loud all highlighted messages
[170:17.72]I don't.
[170:19.46]That's impossible.
[170:23.80]Because you devalued the wink.
[170:27.24]So you guys are just devaluing the highlighted chat messages.
[170:30.27]That's what you're doing.
[170:33.57]The more you do that, the more devalued they become.
[170:36.71]Jerma lied about reading highlights.
[170:38.71]Hey, what?
[170:41.25]Jerma, you just said, alright, I'm moving on.
[170:42.75]Look at this chat.
[170:43.39]What a fucking engaged chat, by the way.
[170:47.69]Look at this.
[170:49.51]This is the third worst chat experience.
[170:57.40]What are you talking about?
[170:58.32]I would put this as the first best chat experience of 2020.
[171:04.36]Sorry, I didn't really know why I said that.
[171:07.02]All good.
[171:07.46]Enjoy the hook.
[171:09.08]Move over here.
[171:17.63]Jeremy, this is inhuman.
[171:20.49]I didn't do anything.
[171:22.17]I did Bernie Sanders for three hours.
[171:26.79]Look what I got.
[171:27.79]Okay.
[171:31.29]Here's a hook.
[171:36.65]You're back.
[171:40.27]Found you a hook.
[171:41.75]Oh, my stars.
[171:42.75]Thank you.
[171:43.21]I can fix my sign right away.
[171:44.78]That's okay.
[171:48.57]It's fairly simple, but beautifully decorated at least.
[172:20.15]I have a phone too.
[172:21.43]Great.
[172:21.80]I'll be sure to use that.
[172:23.50]I now live here.
[172:25.26]Thank you, Susan.
[172:34.30]I've worked really hard.
[172:37.80]When's community content night?
[172:42.16]Give or take maybe like 12 minutes from right now.
[172:45.30]Because I think we're at the end of the game.
[172:54.62]Anything in here?
[172:55.04]Do I use the phone?
[173:01.18]Yeah, there'll be a pee break.
[173:02.70]Who should I call?
[173:03.52]Oh, I don't have any numbers.
[173:12.75]Okay.
[173:14.61]Well, how much money do I have?
[173:15.37]I have five money, which is what... You wanted five money.
[173:26.14]Five money?
[173:29.82]Oh boy, I love questions.
[173:32.15]Five money.
[173:32.89]Hi, Mary.
[173:36.37]Hey, Detective.
[173:40.07]How's the extortion going?
[173:42.55]I think I've got your five money.
[173:44.93]Whoa, for real?
[173:47.52]I didn't think the extortion would work so quickly.
[173:50.76]That's excellent news.
[173:53.04]I'm really good at being extorted.
[173:55.98]I'll say.
[173:58.16]Anyway, do you have the information for me?
[174:02.26]Totally.
[174:03.90]Last night I saw the postman drop off a parcel.
[174:07.81]It was around the time the parade got destroyed.
[174:09.89]I couldn't see who he was giving it to, but it was someone here in the town.
[174:16.63]Barney is the postman's name.
[174:19.03]He's a chill dude.
[174:20.63]I don't think he'd mind if you called him.
[174:23.19]I have his number.
[174:25.40]May I have it?
[174:26.84]Absolutely.
[174:29.38]Got a phone number.
[174:33.42]Thanks for giving me this money.
[174:35.47]I'm really excited to see Froggywood.
[174:38.19]I'm excited too.
[174:40.91]And then I have to wait until the parade's over.
[174:42.29]Of course.
[174:42.85]See you around, detective.
[174:44.89]Now we call Barney.
[174:47.31]Do a nose cam.
[176:01.92]Everybody always talks shit when we repeat a joke on the channel.
[176:05.62]You guys are gonna request nose cam.
[176:08.90]How dare you.
[176:09.90]How actually fucking dare you.
[176:17.47]Hmm, who should I call?
[176:19.35]Call the mysterious number.
[176:28.51]That's a small phone number.
[176:34.21]Uh, he's driving.
[176:38.84]Hi, it's Barney.
[176:42.60]I have you on speaker.
[176:45.42]Hi, Barney.
[176:47.02]Hi.
[176:47.74]Who am I talking to?
[176:50.88]Lobster cop.
[176:52.38]Wow, really?
[176:54.28]No, I was tricking you.
[176:56.70]Rats.
[176:58.06]Who is this, Noodle?
[177:00.06]I'm the detective.
[177:01.00]I'm calling about an incident that happened last night on Warlock Woods.
[177:04.88]I didn't do it.
[177:06.77]Do what?
[177:08.05]Whatever you're calling about, it wasn't me.
[177:11.49]Are you sure?
[177:15.07]What did I do?
[177:17.05]Last night someone destroyed a parade which was being set up for the new resident of the town, the Invisible Wizard.
[177:23.05]I was told you were in the area when it happened.
[177:26.31]Oh yeah, I was there.
[177:28.19]Didn't destroy anything, if that's what you're asking.
[177:31.01]Was just delivering a parcel.
[177:33.82]Who were you delivering it to?
[177:36.42]Uh... What was your name?
[177:40.23]Uh, Lola.
[177:42.49]I don't think there's anyone in town called Lola.
[177:45.71]Must have been someone who lives there.
[177:47.13]The address was on the parcel.
[177:49.69]Oh, I can't remember exactly what house it was.
[177:51.73]Sorry.
[177:52.13]Do you remember where the parcel was sent from?
[177:57.30]Oh, yeah.
[177:57.70]I deliver a lot of parcels from them.
[177:59.78]It was from the whizbay.net headquarters.
[178:03.34]That sounds really familiar, like the two of us on the phone right now.
[178:06.88]You just are a little older sounding than me.
[178:09.52]Where have I heard that name before?
[178:12.12]I know Mandy buys a lot of stuff from there, but this wasn't for her.
[178:16.64]Do you know what was in the package?
[178:18.54]Some sort of shoe, I think, maybe two shoes, pair of shoes.
[178:22.88]Did you get a good look at them?
[178:25.24]It was pretty dark.
[178:26.70]I have no recollection of really seeing anyone.
[178:30.85]Not even if this guy's a terrible mailman.
[178:32.77]Yeah, six, six, six, six viewers right now.
[178:36.15]Fucking pray.
[178:39.80]Oh, weird.
[178:40.32]Warlock Woods is pretty dark, but I haven't had much trouble seeing anyone before.
[178:46.26]Me neither.
[178:46.88]It wasn't much more dark than normal either.
[178:48.72]All I remember is a blue dress with stars on it.
[178:51.97]I'm pretty stumped on this case, Barney.
[178:53.61]Do you know if there were any clues left behind his signature on the delivery slip or something?
[178:58.26]I didn't get them to sign it, but I remember someone dropping over at the entrance to the woods.
[179:02.87]I tried to call and tell them, but they'd stumble off before I noticed.
[179:07.59]At the entrance to the woods, you say?
[179:09.11]I'll check it out.
[179:09.75]What did we just have?
[179:12.84]Fucking community subs?
[179:15.78]How many subs just came in?
[179:18.26]One, two, three, four, five, six community subs from Great Canadian FK Club.
[179:24.87]Thank you.
[179:28.47]Thanks, Great Canadian.
[179:29.37]Appreciate it.
[179:31.97]Accidentally crashed his van into the decorations.
[179:33.81]Drove away without realizing.
[179:35.21]Alright.
[179:35.43]Well, we have a new motive.
[179:38.44]So now we have to go look for this package.
[179:45.22]Wherever that is.
[179:45.84]I don't know.
[179:48.20]What about... Didn't they say it was in the beginning of the town?
[179:53.60]Can I not leave?
[179:55.92]I mean, I know it's that person's username, right?
[179:58.16]The eBay, whatever it was.
[180:00.78]I missed it?
[180:06.39]This must be the thing Barney was talking about.
[180:07.91]Hmm, they're glasses.
[180:13.47]Hmm.
[180:14.75]Oh, they have a name engraved on them.
[180:16.75]The Invisible Wizard.
[180:17.89]Well, this is my only clue left.
[180:19.03]I think I should try and return these to the wizard.
[180:21.41]You should be in the old house near Carlos' shop.
[180:27.84]Use your fucking eyes.
[180:28.86]Use your glasses, Jeremy.
[180:35.43]Don't anger me.
[180:36.13]Alright, where's the wizard's house?
[180:40.41]Right here?
[180:46.86]Hello, is anyone home?
[180:47.80]I found these glasses.
[181:00.14]Oh right, it's an invisible wizard.
[181:13.99]But not really.
[181:14.77]Hello?
[181:35.55]Alright.
[181:41.20]I'll just find you again.
[181:42.20]Was that real?
[181:44.08]I don't know, man.
[181:45.06]This is fucking scaring the shit out of me.
[181:48.34]This is fucking scaring the shit out of me.
[181:50.36]Yeah.
[182:01.09]No, this is seriously fucking scaring the shit out of me.
[182:18.01]This is fucking crazy.
[182:19.39]This is scaring the shit out of me.
[182:22.15]Door opened?
[182:23.05]Fuck.
[182:23.73]Okay.
[182:25.31]Fuck.
[182:40.02]Jesus.
[182:40.80]This is fucking scaring the shit out of me.
[182:50.22]Ah, who's there?
[182:51.28]Oh, I'm sorry.
[182:53.92]I didn't mean to startle you.
[182:56.51]I'm the detective.
[183:01.99]Oh, thank goodness.
[183:03.95]You're here to solve the mystery.
[183:06.79]Yes.
[183:09.14]Okay.
[183:10.34]Well, I don't know where my glasses are.
[183:13.56]So solve that as soon as possible, please.
[183:16.44]Thanks in advance.
[183:20.03]I found your glasses, I think.
[183:22.53]Are these yours?
[183:23.19]Oh, I can see again.
[183:26.21]That was so quick.
[183:28.14]You should get a promotion.
[183:29.94]I don't remember calling a detective to solve this mystery, but I must have done so.
[183:34.84]Otherwise, why would you be here right now?
[183:37.22]Ha ha ha ha!
[183:39.26]Ha ha.
[183:44.36]Yeah.
[183:46.39]Well...
[183:48.15]No.
[183:49.55]I'm actually here to solve a different mystery.
[183:55.37]Which one?
[183:57.45]I don't mean to ruin surprise, but the town was setting up a parade for you.
[184:02.18]I'm sorry to tell you last night.
[184:04.82]I'm sorry to tell you that last night someone destroyed it.
[184:07.58]Wait, you heard the wizard doing the wrong voice?
[184:13.89]Oh, fuck.
[184:14.31]You're right.
[184:14.61]Sorry.
[184:17.74]However, I've noticed that your house is littered with the decorations.
[184:25.55]Where were you last night?
[184:30.27]I was out in Whiz Bay.
[184:32.35]I got some new shoes.
[184:34.29]I picked express delivery.
[184:36.07]They arrived last night.
[184:39.39]Oh, you're Lola.
[184:41.37]Yes.
[184:42.81]Back to my alibi.
[184:46.25]I went to pick up my shoes from the delivery guy.
[184:49.99]And then I dropped my glasses.
[185:04.59]Oh.
[185:06.94]And that's all I have to say about that.
[185:10.74]Are you sure?
[185:11.36]Yes.
[185:13.52]I think someone else must have destroyed the parade.
[185:17.13]Perhaps one of my enemies.
[185:22.37]You have enemies?
[185:25.31]Um, yeah.
[185:28.46]Who?
[185:30.60]The guy.
[185:33.76]People think it's Bugleberry.
[185:34.68]You're losing viewers.
[185:41.31]Evil guy.
[185:43.43]Sorry, what?
[185:44.51]Enemy.
[185:46.22]Enemy evil a giant evil enemy enemy Evil guy Yeah Are you making this up?
[185:57.89]No Evil dude really is my giant enemy Don't you mean evil guy?

[186:18.16]You are enemy.
[186:19.04]Yes.
[186:22.57]Where can I contact evil guy?
[186:25.41]Oh, he's not able to be contacted.
[186:27.19]He's very mysterious and he's not available right now.
[186:36.60]Or ever even.
[186:37.50]Anyway, he must have destroyed the parade.
[186:40.90]case solved we did it well done well done wow too bad he's not able to be apprehended but at least we can continue with our lives Lola are you being dishonest yes I'm really sorry it was me it was an accident I swear it you destroyed the parade didn't you
[187:19.18]I didn't know the parade was for me.
[187:20.62]That's so nice.
[187:22.06]And I've ruined it.
[187:24.10]When I dropped my glasses, I couldn't find my way home.
[187:26.04]I was bumming and everything was horrible.
[187:32.19]Please don't post cringe again.
[187:38.27]What happened when you got home?
[187:40.30]I had some chips stuck to me, so I ate those.
[187:43.16]And then I just hid.
[187:46.62]Why didn't you tell anyone what happened?
[187:49.62]I'm so embarrassed about it.
[187:51.84]I only just moved in and already I've made a big mistake.
[187:58.38]Can you guys even fucking hear that?
[188:12.67]Why is that not working?
[188:16.68]This has not been working the whole time.
[188:20.36]No way.
[188:26.70]I recorded it.
[188:29.18]Yabba dabba doo.
[188:31.96]Why are you not hearing this?
[188:33.32]I'm so fucking mad.
[188:35.15]I played this, like, I've been playing this sentence for the last, like, 15 straight minutes, like, every few minutes.
[188:41.26]Because I sampled it.
[188:42.72]I don't know why it's not working.
[188:49.70]That's annoying.
[188:51.82]That's annoying.
[188:54.62]What the fuck happened?
[188:55.86]Oh, wait, what?
[188:59.40]Oh, that's annoying, whatever.
[189:00.90]Oh, that sucks.
[189:04.54]I thought I had it set up correctly.
[189:06.42]What a pain in the ass.
[189:07.14]Whatever.
[189:07.46]Fucking joke sucked.
[189:08.84]Ruined.
[189:09.12]I sampled myself saying something and I was... I thought you guys could hear it and I was just not paying attention to it.
[189:17.05]It was fucking hilarious.
[189:18.83]I'm a very shy lady detective.
[189:20.45]I make myself invisible so no one can see me.
[189:23.11]That must have been why nobody saw you.
[189:25.45]Yes, I suppose.
[189:26.85]Did it become not invisible, un-invisible, visible?
[189:28.78]If you insist.
[189:35.14]Ta-da!
[189:38.88]You're a frog like me!
[189:41.06]Yes.
[189:42.24]I'm slightly disappointed.
[189:43.55]What?
[189:45.39]Well, it's just that I had a good joke prepared.
[189:48.33]I know how it feels.
[189:50.19]We're the same person, you and I. Exact same fucking person.
[189:53.25]I'll do it anyways.
[189:55.05]Okay, so imagine that instead of a frog, you were revealed to be a lizard.
[189:58.86]Oh, no.
[190:00.30]Okay, so you've just been revealed, okay?
[190:02.00]Pretend.
[190:03.29]Okay.
[190:04.03]It's me, a lizard.
[190:04.87]Wow, so you're not an invisible wizard after all.
[190:09.52]You're an invisible lizard.
[190:11.40]That was way worse than mine.
[190:13.68]Don't even say that that was on the same level as the joke I was going to make.
[190:22.41]Don't do minus twos for something I didn't say.
[190:28.03]You know what?
[190:30.01]Fuck you guys, I'm out of here.
[190:48.29]Yeah, it was a good joke.
[190:49.53]I thought, me too.
[190:51.27]Detective, are you going to tell everyone?
[191:01.96]Was that even a joke you were going to make?
[191:03.68]No, no.
[191:05.78]Why is it not playing?
[191:06.68]It lights up and I can see it playing.
[191:13.37]It's just not being broadcast through to you guys for some crazy reason.
[191:18.34]I think they'd forgive you right away.
[191:23.25]What if they don't?
[191:27.27]I want to make a good first impression.
[191:30.13]When we go outside, can you please tell them that I was- that it was Evil Guy?
[191:33.71]That's a lie.
[191:34.97]A white lie, perhaps.
[191:36.29]But who is it harming, really?
[191:37.91]Evil Guy.
[191:38.67]Evil Guy isn't real.
[191:40.01]This is a moral dilemma, Lola.
[191:41.77]Just like in my favorite episode of Periot.
[191:44.53]Periot.
[191:45.93]Per-wa?
[191:46.59]Per-wa?
[191:47.67]Per-wa?
[191:49.21]It's your choice, detective.
[191:50.37]Let's face the music.
[191:58.63]Probably the routing settings in your GoXLR.
[192:00.13]Yeah, I thought I had it set correctly.
[192:02.02]I guess not.
[192:05.48]Alright.
[192:07.10]Frog Detective 2.
[192:09.20]Complete.
[192:16.01]Now we're moving on to Community Content Night.
[192:18.17]Episode 2.
[192:18.65]Week 2.
[192:19.01]Hello!
[192:29.33]Hi.
[192:30.85]My name is Lola.
[192:31.65]Hi, Lola.
[192:33.27]I'm a frog.
[192:34.67]Just like me.
[192:35.97]We're so glad you could make it, Lola.
[192:37.81]You guys are standing way too close together.
[192:40.74]Sorry that there's been so much commotion trying to get the parade ready for you.
[192:43.96]Somebody destroyed it last night.
[192:45.92]Barry, don't tell her that.
[192:47.74]We're sorry that somebody destroyed it, Lola.
[192:49.44]The detective has been trying to figure out who did it.
[192:53.18]Well, detective, have you solved the mystery?
[192:55.18]Hope it wasn't me.
[192:57.10]I'd be surprised if it was any of us.
[192:59.16]I wouldn't, looking at you, Ralph.
[193:01.64]What?
[193:02.64]Ralph didn't do it, Victor.
[193:04.02]How many times do we have to tell you?
[193:05.86]I just don't trust that guy.
[193:07.28]Rude.
[193:08.44]I'm not rude anymore, Ralph.
[193:09.64]I had food.
[193:10.99]I don't think that's how food works.
[193:13.17]I didn't do it.
[193:13.91]Well, I guess we'll find out in a moment.
[193:20.27]Go ahead, detective.
[193:24.53]She did it.
[193:27.16]Who was it?
[193:31.11]It was, it was Lola.
[193:33.53]What?
[193:34.97]It was an accident.
[193:36.21]Lola dropped her glasses last night while picking up some shoes she bought on Whizbay.
[193:40.97]Oh my gosh, those are the ones I really wanted!
[193:42.71]They look amazing!
[193:45.21]Lola can't see without her glasses, so she had a lot of trouble getting home last night.
[193:48.23]I'm doing the thing that you- I'm doing the mother- the parents reading the story in bed when you're a kid, and they're getting- they're losing interest, and they're falling asleep, and then they start to do- we talked about this before.
[193:59.44]She bumped into just about everything.
[194:04.50]I'm so sorry, I feel awful.
[194:06.46]I realized what happened when I had lots of chips stuck to me.
[194:10.68]Yeah, Mary destroys stuff all the time.
[194:11.86]Yeah, I really do.
[194:13.10]Plus, Naughty tried to vacuum you up, so I feel like the parade being destroyed is kind of fine.
[194:34.33]I thought she was a ghost.
[194:36.21]That's what they all say.
[194:37.04]Hee hee.
[194:38.76]We're all really excited you're here, Lola.
[194:40.48]We don't need decorations anyway.
[194:42.58]I really thought Ralph did it.
[194:44.66]Victor!
[194:45.70]Victor, apologize right now to Ralph.
[194:51.69]Ralph.
[194:53.39]Sorry I said ayaya.
[194:55.55]It's not okay.
[194:57.37]This is a real conversation that I have with my chat once a week.
[195:02.14]I'm also sorry.
[195:03.40]I really didn't mean to destroy the parade, but I should have spoken up when I did.
[195:07.40]I'm a very nervous lady.
[195:08.58]Plus, what a terrible first impression.
[195:11.03]Not as bad as my first impression.
[195:13.35]What did you do?
[195:14.43]I ran over Mary by accident.
[195:16.95]Haha, yeah.
[195:18.05]That was really painful.
[195:19.91]Should we get this party started?
[195:22.56]Another party.
[195:23.10]Let's go.
[195:23.44]Are we going to pick another dancer?
[195:44.49]Okay, why does this feel like something that I would see on British television?
[195:49.41]What's happening right now?
[196:03.76]The song, too.
[196:04.90]The music.
[196:06.42]What everybody's doing.
[196:07.64]The way that everybody is and looks and...
[196:13.31]Special thanks to the SUPERHOT team.
[196:15.77]Oh, HashHouse, HashHouse, HouseHouse.
[196:17.93]Geeks.
[196:18.15]Chad.
[196:18.37]Ben.
[196:18.61]Papa.
[196:18.97]Naughty the dog.
[196:20.13]Ben, Ben, Ben.
[196:48.20]I'll get it right.
[196:48.68]I just got an achievement.
[197:02.14]It's called snitch.
[197:23.04]I live in my house!
[197:26.57]I live in my house!
[197:29.49]Okay, where?
[197:30.31]Right here.
[197:35.13]Frog Detective, Crime Solving Agency.
[197:36.45]Frog Detective speaking.
[197:37.05]How can I help you?
[197:37.83]Detective.
[197:40.11]Supervisor.
[197:41.23]It's me, the supervisor.
[197:42.19]I am aware.
[197:43.22]Great job on solving the invisible wizard mystery.
[197:45.10]That was quite a head scratcher.
[197:47.04]Sure was.
[197:49.61]I was shocked that the culprit was the wizard herself.
[197:52.77]Yeah, the mysteries I solve are never what they seem.
[197:55.65]It's always a misunderstanding or an accident.
[197:57.78]No one is ever malicious on purpose in my mysteries.
[198:01.16]I'm so glad that crime isn't real.
[198:06.24]Didn't you get extorted earlier?
[198:09.37]Yes, I think that's a crime.
[198:12.61]I suppose that crime is real after all.
[198:15.75]Your office is called Frog Detective Crime Solving Agency.
[198:18.95]Yes.
[198:19.99]Detective, why do you believe that crime isn't real?
[198:25.15]Community Night sucks.
[198:26.39]Frog Detective forever.
[198:28.19]We did it all.
[198:28.89]We did every Frog Detective that exists.
[198:31.85]There's no more to do.
[198:32.59]There's no more to do.
[198:34.91]I was exaggerating.
[198:35.73]Plus, despite my job title, I never really seemed to be solving crimes.
[198:42.44]That's going to change in a moment, I think, Detective.
[198:45.06]Oh, super duper.
[198:46.70]Just got a call about a doozy of a case.
[198:48.41]That sounds exciting.
[198:50.93]It is, but it's also the most challenging case I've ever sent you on.
[198:56.01]I'm confident in your abilities, but you might need backup on this one.
[199:00.76]Like who?
[199:02.00]I'm gonna send Lobster Cop to help you with the case.
[199:06.52]Really?
[199:07.42]Lobster Cop handles such advanced cases.
[199:09.36]Won't I just slow him down?
[199:11.56]Nonsense, detective.
[199:12.44]You've shown you're a very capable mystery solver.
[199:15.26]I think you're in the running to be the new number one.
[199:18.29]You're making me blush.
[199:19.95]You'll be a-okay.
[199:21.91]So where am I heading next?
[199:23.65]I can't say over the phone.
[199:24.45]It's too sensitive.
[199:26.47]Wow.
[199:27.81]Head to the train station.
[199:28.61]I've left a ticket for you there.
[199:31.47]The train will take you to where you need to be.
[199:34.05]Good law.
[199:34.35]I want to meet this character.
[199:37.32]Good luck, detective.
[199:38.10]Do you think you can handle it?
[199:39.28]I can handle anything.
[199:40.23]Alright.
[199:46.21]Frog Detective will return in Episode 3 after the detective has left.
[200:10.17]Is somebody breaking in the room and stealing something?
[200:14.47]Alright.
[200:40.50]He looks like he's made of ice cream.
[200:41.74]He looks like he's made of ice cream.
[200:47.56]I would love to eat Frog Detective in an ice cream bar.
[200:51.55]It's definitely lemon lime.
[201:07.28]You know those shark bars?
[201:08.38]The shark popsicles?
[201:09.52]I feel like he's a creamier version of that flavor.
[201:12.16]Isn't that a character on Sesame Street?
[201:36.14]the detective will return in cowboy county corruption at cowboy county what happened to community content night I deleted everything accidentally
[201:59.81]I just like, there was a ton of it.
[202:00.92]I just fucking hit, I pressed the backspace button on it with everything selected.
[202:04.97]Sorry.
