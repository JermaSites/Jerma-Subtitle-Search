[00:45.12]Oh, thank God, Elibis is actually in here.
[00:48.82]Oh, thank God.
[00:51.09]My goodness, imagine if it wasn't.
[01:00.30]Okay.
[01:00.46]Okay, let's go.
[01:16.71]Elevates!
[01:23.12]You're gonna like this one!
[01:24.16]I don't know, what do I title this stream now?
[01:29.98]Like, fucking magical creatures?
[01:31.92]Finding magical creatures?
[01:34.12]You, like, clean a house in this game.
[01:35.38]I'm gonna love this.
[01:36.58]I was gonna save this for, like, tomorrow, because this is what I was thinking about doing tomorrow, but we're doing it today, because, uh, fucking video games, I'm lied to.
[01:53.23]Let's go.
[01:53.55]I have to buy rabbits again.
[02:03.04]Elevates is such a good game.
[02:04.20]Oh, I know.
[02:05.03]Sometimes you gotta pull out the big ones.
[02:08.81]Searching for magical creatures.
[02:17.34]There you go.
[02:27.36]Your face cam.
[02:32.26]This game is actually like the ultimate pogchamp.
[02:37.01]You guys are gonna love this game.
[02:41.37]Alright, story mode, multiplayer, extras.
[02:43.61]We're gonna do story.
[02:46.37]In this tutorial, you can learn how to play the game and view advanced tips.
[02:49.05]Would you like to start the tutorial?
[02:50.73]Yes!
[03:00.54]Oh, fuck.
[03:00.94]Hold on.
[03:03.34]This is searching for magical creatures with Cabela's Deer Hunt still on the game title.
[03:13.63]How about... I don't know.
[03:14.85]Clean your room.
[03:16.35]Clean your room.
[03:20.43]Done.
[03:20.69]There we go.
[03:25.54]With the remote pointing at the sensor bar, slowly move it left and right to look... Stop being so tangled or I'll bite it.
[03:35.49]Okay, you can also look up and down, look up and down, left and right.
[03:39.03]Let's give it a try.
[03:40.17]Let's try.
[03:40.67]This is really, it's really like high quality fluid game too.
[03:46.72]This is really, really fluid and high quality.
[03:51.88]Okay.
[03:53.80]Next step.
[03:55.22]Try slowly moving the cursor up, down, left, and right.
[03:57.12]You move the camera.
[03:58.72]This is a really high quality fluid fucking experience.
[04:05.07]Keep it in the blue frame.
[04:09.27]Slowly move the cursor up and down and keep it in there.
[04:21.51]This is an incredible game.
[04:23.09]Yeah.
[04:24.23]I know.
[04:26.57]It was either this or I was going to put in Beautiful Joe.
[04:28.45]I got to pull out all the stops here.
[04:43.58]Let's learn how to move.
[04:45.08]Move forward by slowly tilting the nunchucks control stick forward.
[04:49.31]Tilt the control stick backwards to move backwards.
[04:51.17]Tilt it left to right.
[04:51.93]You move.
[04:52.67]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:54.03]The thing to remember here is to point the Wii Remote the direction you wish to move.
[05:01.98]Let's give it a try.
[05:02.74]Alright, let's give it a go.
[05:03.36]Ready?
[05:03.78]Check it out.
[05:06.64]This is moving up, down.
[05:07.48]You strafe.
[05:08.40]You tilt.
[05:11.50]Alright, now let's do it with the controller.
[05:15.48]This is VR movement.
[05:19.80]You guys don't understand.
[05:21.98]This game is one of the... This is probably the best game... Probably like one of the top 10 games on the Wii.
[05:26.94]And you're about to see it.
[05:28.51]Live and in person on Jerma985.
[05:30.45]I'm selling this game up so high.
[05:32.71]Because the last hour and 40 minutes has been a disaster.
[05:35.53]So I'm trying to just keep you here.
[05:36.79]Alright, let's learn how to crouch.
[05:40.65]Or C to stretch, Z to crouch.
[05:46.18]Let me try.
[05:49.84]That's how you stretch, and that's how you scrunch.
[05:53.36]Stretch, scrunch, stretch, scrunch.
[05:56.20]Good.
[05:58.30]Live from Las Vegas.
[06:02.04]And I got a face cam on.
[06:03.13]Are you serious?
[06:05.15]What a day to stick around on the stream.
[06:07.37]Please, God, don't fucking leave.
[06:15.99]Grabbing objects or catching elements is referred to as capturing.
[06:19.01]Let's learn how to capture an object.
[06:20.93]You can grab objects by holding the capture beam over them during the game.
[06:24.54]Press the A button or the B button in the Wii mode to shoot out the capture beam.
[06:27.82]The beam will shoot while the button is down.
[06:29.88]If an object is too heavy, the cursor will turn red while you point at it, and you will be able to grab but not capture it.
[06:35.75]Let's go.
[06:37.03]I thought it was saying F.
[06:47.79]F. Why F?
[06:51.45]While holding an object, move the Wiimote in the desired way.
[06:56.55]You can move it left, right, up, down.
[07:03.80]Why are people doing F?
[07:06.78]Oh, it's the block.
[07:08.18]Okay.
[07:09.74]While holding an object, move the Wiimote back to pull it, move it forward to move it.
[07:12.74]Yeah, you go like this.
[07:13.56]Twist the Wiimote left or right while holding an object to tilt that object.
[07:15.89]You can open the doors.
[07:17.77]Try moving the red object into the red frame.
[07:20.49]And the blue object into the blue frame.
[07:22.31]Let's give it a try.
[07:23.39]Go.
[07:38.54]Got it.
[07:40.40]This is not a toddler game.
[07:41.36]This is a cleaning game, which means I'm going to play more.
[07:46.60]Alright, we're almost done.
[07:49.83]I'm gonna have to back up a little bit, I think, here.
[07:52.37]Which means I have to put pants on.
[07:54.15]I'm gonna have to take a break and I'm gonna have to put, like, fucking pants and, like, underwear on and stuff.
[07:58.39]Like, uh... That's just... I'm just giving you real... Next, let's learn how to capture an elephant!
[08:06.80]Look at these little things!
[08:07.48]An elephant is a living entity with a mysterious energy.
[08:09.70]If you capture one, that energy will cause various things to happen.
[08:14.18]After an elephant points with the cursor and pushes the A button, the elephant enters your capture gun and tank as Watts.
[08:21.23]Watts of the game's unit of energy collect Watts to fill the lightbulb gauge, which will turn blacked-out lights back on.
[08:27.11]Give it a try.
[08:29.25]Here we go.
[08:30.47]After the elephants.
[08:39.84]Got it.
[08:46.53]He's gonna get banned one day.
[08:48.01]I've gotten... Alright, that's it.
[08:52.80]I'm gonna take a break here in a second, and I'm gonna put on clothes.
[08:56.86]I have clothes on, but I need more appropriate clothes.
[08:58.60]Because I'm gonna have to fucking move back for this.
[09:05.49]How to use capturing to do various things.
[09:07.45]You can use the capture gun to grab and open or close drawers.
[09:10.19]Yep.
[09:12.38]Grab a drawer and pull.
[09:15.48]Let's give it a try, let's try it.
[09:19.96]There's an elevator in there.
[09:27.52]You search for these things through the whole house and you get them all and you can use them to turn on stuff.
[09:32.32]This is how you turn a faucet or doorknob.
[09:36.80]You use the capture gun to grab a faucet and twist it.
[09:40.30]Let's go.
[09:42.25]Sometimes they come out of the water.
[09:45.05]This game sucks.
[09:45.81]No it does not.
[09:46.41]That is so unbelievably wrong.
[10:02.28]This is such a good game.
[10:03.20]Yes it is.
[10:04.88]Elements are hiding.
[10:07.57]Grab items and shake them.
[10:09.05]Just go like this.
[10:19.66]okay got it you're trying to hype this game we'll see we'll see how you feel about 15 minutes thought break sound what about it does this make a good vr game it would
[10:43.10]Little bits love small nooks and crannies, and to hide between or under things, find and capture them to turn the lights back on.
[10:48.40]Let's go.
[10:59.43]I'm gonna have to stand up for this.
[11:00.77]You're gonna see the full boomer brace.
[11:02.13]I think this might turn into a stand-up stream.
[11:07.42]Alright, what else we got?
[11:11.22]Here we are.
[11:13.07]Get them all!
[11:13.83]Yeah, this is gonna be a stand-up stream, I think.
[11:34.68]Pants on.
[11:35.06]Don't worry, I'm gonna... Alright, now the lights turn back on.
[11:39.44]Would you like to do the next tutorial?
[11:40.76]Yeah.
[11:46.90]Streamer stands for the first time in six years.
[11:57.44]Stages include doors that won't open until you have enough watts.
[11:59.84]The doors show how many watts are required to open them.
[12:02.70]See?
[12:07.26]Let's go.
[12:18.81]A door somewhere just opened!
[12:19.77]Ah, there it is.
[12:24.91]Let's go.
[12:27.63]Excuse me.
[12:37.00]This is a Pikmin ripoff?
[12:39.38]Oh, that's... No, that's not even remotely... That's not... Just wait.
[12:42.72]Just wait ten minutes.
[12:51.91]This is a stand-up comedy stream.
[12:59.11]This game sucks.
[13:01.23]Oh man.
[13:02.65]Imagine if you just didn't know.
[13:04.03]Imagine if you didn't know.
[13:06.45]You know what I mean?
[13:08.94]I can't imagine not knowing.
[13:11.37]Okay.
[13:12.53]Electrical appliances display the amount of watts required to use them, so once you gather enough watts, they will turn on.
[13:17.73]Once an appliance is usable, point at the switch with the button sensor and press the A button after the cursor changes.
[13:24.90]Turn on the appliance.
[13:36.01]150 for that.
[13:38.09]TV is energized.
[13:39.63]Turn it on.
[13:40.86]Look at that!
[13:42.24]What do you mean, what sensor?
[13:53.70]Okay, increase capturing power.
[13:55.15]I'm just getting my memory refreshed.
[13:56.81]You're stealing cable.
[14:07.45]Oh, it's kind of pog, I guess.
[14:10.54]When you use an electrical appliance, yellow and pink elements come out.
[14:13.72]These elements are called power elements.
[14:15.34]Capture power elements to charge up your capture's gun power gauge.
[14:21.14]Fill this gauge to level up the gun's capture power.
[14:24.14]When the level increases, you can carry heavier objects.
[14:27.52]Capture power elements and level up your capture power.
[14:33.96]Interesting.
[14:46.05]TV energized.
[14:46.69]Let's go.
[14:47.31]Telephone energized.
[14:55.89]I can now carry 2.2 kilograms of material.
[15:00.65]Look at that!
[15:03.68]The games still suck!
[15:24.78]You're making a mess.
[15:28.66]Alright, review what you've learned so far and capture even more Elevates.
[15:41.24]The movement's so fun, too.
[15:48.03]A door somewhere has opened.
[15:49.01]Good, but we're not done collecting Elevates.
[15:56.00]Alright, telephone has been energized.
[15:57.00]Toy train energized.
[15:57.74]Let's go.
[16:05.61]Gotta get them all.
[16:12.87]Open the fucking door.
[16:16.47]Why are you?
[16:16.99]Okay, I gotta stand up.
[16:18.67]Here we go.
[16:19.07]Ready?
[16:27.50]Level three.
[16:57.15]Open everything.
[16:57.69]This would be a wicked fun VR game.
[17:08.01]I know it would.
[17:09.50]Alright, we got it.
[17:10.12]This is Viscera cleanup details at worst.
[17:14.46]What's with you guys today only giving games like 12 seconds before you want to change?
[17:18.44]What is going on with you guys today?
[17:27.91]This is like one of the best Wii games to release.
[17:35.77]We can smell when a game sucks.
[17:37.13]Oh no, you cannot.
[17:38.88]No, you cannot.
[17:39.56]I refuse to have you guys say this game sucks.
[17:42.30]It's like saying that Mario Sunshine sucks.
[17:44.42]I mean... It doesn't.
[17:48.36]Okay.
[17:49.58]Items may have special effects such as temporarily improving gun capture performance.
[17:53.30]Check this out.
[17:57.07]Grab an item and smash it to activate it.
[17:59.87]Here we go, ready?
[18:04.90]Homing Laser locks on and grabs multiple Elevates.
[18:27.66]There are lots of items you can get.
[18:35.33]Now this is my dopamine levels just exploded.
[18:38.19]Yeah.
[18:43.33]Elevates are emotional living beings that cry, dance, and even run away in terror.
[18:47.71]Depending on the state of an Elevate when you capture it, the amount of Watts you acquire will also vary.
[18:53.19]When an Elevate is running away, its Watts will decrease, and the bubble that appears when you capture it will turn red.
[18:59.46]When an Elevate is stressed or unconscious, they provide a normal number of Watts.
[19:03.68]This capture bubble will be white.
[19:06.08]Elevates that are sleeping or singing provide a higher number of Watts.
[19:09.12]This capture bubble will be as blue.
[19:11.93]Watch the Elevates' actions carefully and try capturing them in different states.
[19:14.69]Alright, that one was having fun.
[19:18.49]This one's sleeping.
[19:20.03]That one's confused.
[19:22.38]That one's crying.
[19:23.06]See how it was different?
[19:25.90]Okay, now let's, like, scare them.
[19:29.44]Let's, like, throw a box over here.
[19:33.06]E-M Pulse Ball knocks out all Elevates in a range.
[19:41.25]Oh, it just has to be around, okay.
[19:44.23]They're all sleeping when this is around.
[19:46.77]And it makes them just climb to collect.
[19:54.73]This game gets really fucking hard, too.
[20:03.07]Alright, we're both here.
[20:08.44]Fleeing is red.
[20:09.36]Yeah.
[20:10.74]You want to try to get him in a good state.
[20:12.50]Get to the first boss.
[20:18.96]Elephant cookie attracts elephants for a time.
[20:22.11]So you go like this.
[20:23.95]And they'll go after it.
[20:24.63]Go get that cookie.
[20:25.89]Wake up.
[20:31.17]Eat this cookie.
[20:33.71]Oh, you're already dead.
[20:34.53]Whatever.
[20:40.23]There's no other items, right?
[20:44.77]I have to just get them all?
[20:50.72]Alright, we're good.
[20:59.50]Nice work.
[21:02.11]Electrical appliances.
[21:02.95]Didn't we already do this?
[21:08.03]Gotta catch them all.
[21:13.79]Just skip the tutorial.
[21:14.79]Oh right, you can turn on the coffee makers and shit.
[21:17.67]Okay.
[21:17.79]I think we're almost done.
[21:44.84]You're getting hard blinks, chat.
[21:48.20]The legendary pink elebits are the rarest of all.
[21:52.54]Capturing them unlocks a new game mode.
[21:54.40]You gotta catch them all.
[21:55.50]Look at them.
[21:59.17]There are always three pink elebits on each non-boss stage, and they will appear in different ways.
[22:03.93]The first hides normally, but the second is in a Potter's shoe, which you will eat eventually.
[22:08.33]The third appears next once the special conditions are met.
[22:10.61]Find them all.
[22:15.59]There.
[22:15.79]You happy?
[22:17.97]Just one more story!
[22:19.92]Alright, watch the fucking opening cutscene while I go put on pants.
[22:25.60]Okay, I'll read you one more, but then it's off to sleep.
[22:33.34]My name is Kai, and I hate elephants.
[22:38.23]My mom and dad study elephants, and they love them even more than me.
[22:44.30]Elabits came from a great, big bolt of lightning.
[22:49.48]It struck years and years before you were even born, Kai.
[22:56.22]They've been friends with people for a long, long time.
[23:02.36]I wish there was no such thing as lightning.
[23:06.34]Then I bet the Elabits would never have shown up.
[23:09.91]And if there were no elephants, Mom and Dad would take me out to an amusement park or something, right?
[23:20.56]Hey!
[23:21.16]Everything's gone dark!
[23:22.68]What do I do now?
[23:28.68]I don't know what happened, but the whole town is in a panic!
[23:34.11]Mom and Dad rushed over to their research lab and left me at home.
[23:42.04]I don't care.
[23:42.72]My favorite show will be on TV soon.
[23:46.72]Huh?
[23:47.40]Why doesn't the TV work?
[23:50.88]Oh, that's right.
[23:54.00]Electricity and cars only work because of Elevates, you know.
[23:59.56]You wouldn't even be able to watch TV without them.
[24:03.10]So, I guess this is all the Elevates' fault?
[24:12.68]But I don't want to pick them up with my bare hands.
[24:16.33]I know.
[24:16.91]I'll use Dad's capture gun.
[25:44.96]I can choose the music?
[25:48.28]He went to go buy Raving Rapids.
[25:57.16]What music do I want?
[26:00.90]No, shit!
[26:01.40]No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, I'm not ready!
[26:03.44]Pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it, pause it, I can't, you can't pause the game!
[26:06.21]Alright.
[26:07.85]Screenshot.
[26:08.53]Right here.
[26:12.81]Now I can move back a little.
[26:13.75]Let me move the mic.
[26:15.54]Let me move the camera.
[26:25.61]Full backpack cam.
[26:27.35]Incoming.
[26:34.07]He's wearing overalls.
[26:37.29]No, I've got my fucking, like, bionic chest plate.
[26:40.85]I've got my- I've got my carapace on.
[26:50.47]Level one armor.
[26:54.17]Yeah, this is like fighting game person armor.
[26:57.40]You know what I mean?
[26:58.00]This is like the, oh yeah, I'm protected.
[27:00.52]Just don't hit me here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, or anywhere else in my whole body.
[27:10.84]PUBG armor.
[27:11.84]Alright, I'm ready.
[27:14.04]I'm ready to fucking play this game.
[27:16.24]No, the camera's not even in the right spot.
[27:23.15]Big ass arm!
[27:25.27]Wait a minute!
[27:26.47]Wait a minute!
[27:41.01]Why does that look like that?
[27:58.23]I'm going to play the game now.
[28:01.41]Unless it's the angle.
[28:02.13]I'm moving.
[28:02.93]I'm changing the angle.
[28:07.40]Alright, we're good.
[28:08.72]Are you ready for this fucking game?
[28:09.76]I'm ready.
[28:10.10]Here we go.
[28:10.42]350 watts.
[28:10.64]Don't wake him up.
[28:11.66]Yeah, I know what it does.
[28:32.45]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[28:34.65]Anybody in there?
[28:41.05]Stretch my head up.
[28:45.31]Okay, good.
[28:48.55]I don't have enough weight, hold on.
[28:54.15]TV turned on?
[28:55.55]We got ready?
[29:02.51]I have enough, right?
[29:03.75]No, I don't have enough.
[29:04.61]Fuck.
[29:06.25]Can I leave the room?
[29:06.83]Not yet.
[29:12.52]Toy Train's been energized.

[42:50.39]I've destroyed everything.
[42:51.47]What else is there to fucking break?
[42:57.48]Oh yeah, the screen title is Clean Your Room.
[43:00.82]This is not how you clean a room.
[43:07.12]That's ac- yes, I am, yeah.

[44:25.95]What would you edit?
[44:34.91]Are you drinking Windex?
[44:38.20]Sure.
[44:45.66]Windex is blue.
[44:49.52]It's a fucking feature.
[44:50.51]Whatever.
[44:50.77]I don't care.
[44:51.23]People are going to make fun of me.
[45:06.85]At all the grocery stores, all the fucking water is gone.
[45:11.13]And sometimes, in some of them, what's left is like the expensive stuff.
[45:15.42]So this is all that was available to buy at the grocery store.
[45:19.36]Because all the fucking other water is gone.
[45:27.98]Just boil the water.
[45:33.26]Alright, mom and dad's room.

[48:30.39]Alright, stay still.
[48:37.01]Mini TV has been energized.
[48:42.53]Alright, where is it?
[48:47.42]I just locked myself in here.
[48:49.67]Actually did.
[48:50.15]I don't think I can leap.
[49:20.13]Move them?
[49:22.99]Why can't I move the shirts?
[49:30.25]It can't be opened yet.
[49:32.62]Why?
[49:32.96]What?
[49:37.00]Death's Lamp has been energized.
[49:39.26]Alright, let's go.
[49:41.60]This should put me over the... Wait, can I pull the bed?
[50:02.81]I'm like major focusing right now.

[50:14.12]Antique radio.
[50:14.76]I gotta get the fuck out of the bedroom.
[50:18.22]Let me out of the bedroom, please.
[50:32.42]Fuck, I can't move the books.

[50:36.21]Shredder, activated.
[50:41.77]Alright, there's a lot of shit in here that's activated.
[51:05.57]these urns.
[51:06.79]Flashlight has been activated.

[51:45.49]Ugh, it hurts!
[52:08.72]Turn the fucking thing on, for God, turn it on!
[52:14.76]What the fuck?
[52:17.64]Cookie, cookie, cookie, smash cookie.
[52:56.47]I'm gonna stick around.
[52:57.03]I'm gonna destroy all these books.
[53:04.04]This is the satisfying part of the whole mission.
[53:31.78]Hmm.
[54:00.81]Watch out, the police are coming.
[54:06.81]Wait, out here.
[54:08.77]This is all the shit I can do out here, right?
[54:13.07]Why are all these drawers open in the wrong- Am I not strong enough to move this shit?
[54:31.90]How can I not be this strong?
[54:33.12]There's nothing behind the fucking painting, what?
[54:50.08]There are, there's like a, there's like a piss joke here with like the Sith piss versus fucking Luke Skywalker piss.
[54:57.93]I don't know if I can make it right now though.
[55:02.04]They just have to pee into each other.
[55:08.42]Whatever.
[55:09.93]It's there somewhere.
[55:19.43]Oh, that's cringe, bro.
[55:24.41]Oh, I might need to tighten this.
[55:28.49]He's not even making jokes.
[55:29.77]No, I'm not.
[55:34.56]I might have to actually tighten this.
[55:39.47]What did I mess up here?
[55:44.41]What's the vest for?
[55:45.29]Uh... There's a whole lot of it.
[55:48.37]You would like a new tutorial?
[55:50.39]What is this for?
[56:01.12]This is an improved bloomer brace?
[56:03.80]Kind of.
[56:05.51]Alright, I'll give you the TL;DR.
[56:06.59]I have really bad pain in my ribs and my spine.
[56:09.57]I might have rheumatoid arthritis.
[56:11.17]I have costochondritis, and I have to wear this sometimes because my whole body hurts.
[56:14.96]There you go.
[56:15.32]There's the TL;DR.
[56:16.14]Alright.
[56:24.00]Breakable objects have a mark on the lower right.
[56:26.39]Be careful when handling these objects.
[56:28.67]If you drop or throw these objects, they will break.
[56:31.47]Gently put them back down.
[56:32.57]Also keep in mind that fleeing elements can crash into objects and knock them down, so be careful in such situations.
[56:43.35]Look around before turning appliances on.
[56:44.77]Okay.
[56:50.55]Looks like life is actually pain.
[56:52.17]Well, kind of.
[56:55.53]So I can't, like, just smash stuff anymore.
[57:04.12]I can't break anything?
[57:05.20]How am I going to be able to do this?
[57:06.96]Don't break seven objects.
[57:13.89]I've been just whipping shit around.
[57:15.87]Oh my god.
[57:19.07]Okay, don't break anything.
[57:34.53]I haven't broken anything.
[57:35.29]We're good.
[57:36.67]What the fuck?
[57:37.27]I didn't break.
[57:38.03]What did I break?
[57:38.61]What did I break?
[57:39.05]What did I break?
[57:39.39]What did I break?
[57:39.75]What did I break?
[57:40.17]I didn't break anything.
[57:43.16]What did I break?
[57:43.76]I didn't break shit.
[57:56.62]Oh, there's vases everywhere.
[57:58.06]Alright, put them down.
[58:11.03]Alright, slowly.
[58:14.65]Are these waters of water gonna break?
[58:18.66]No, they made it of plastic, right?
[58:20.24]Alright, I almost have enough.
[58:29.36]Okay.
[58:29.74]Alright, I'm gonna back up a little bit.
[58:42.37]flashlight energized.
[58:43.49]Alright, the lights are coming on, thank God.
[58:58.26]Ah!
[58:59.10]Don't break anything!
[59:09.87]Alright, we're okay.
[59:10.95]I have 15 minutes to do this.
[59:12.20]I can slow down.
[59:12.84]Why am I going this fast?
[59:34.08]It's gonna shatter.
[59:34.84]This doesn't count as me breaking something, right?
[59:37.44]Alright, good.
[59:38.92]Level 2?
[59:39.84]Not yet, huh?
[59:42.20]Come on, really?
[59:42.70]Go downstairs?
[59:43.32]See, I see you can't go downstairs.
[59:45.49]The music's tight.
[59:46.13]Yeah, the music is really good.
[60:10.42]Door opened?
[60:11.01]Oh, it did?
[60:11.43]Hold on.
[60:18.59]Oh, it did.
[60:18.93]You're right.
[60:20.95]Alright, don't break anything.
[60:32.24]Just slowly do it.
[60:43.02]Oh, don't break it.
[60:43.98]Don't break it.
[60:44.60]Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.
[60:45.68]I have 12 minutes.
[61:02.49]These are pens.
[61:18.83]Alright, colorful PC.
[61:24.74]Alright, now what?
[61:26.36]Careful, careful, I can lift shit up now.
[62:02.32]gamer posture.
[62:03.08]Oh, I'm going to have to tighten myself though.
[62:08.62]It's starting to, it's starting to hurt.
[62:14.54]I think it's the way that I'm holding the Wiimote maybe and like going like this and just tensing up a little.
[62:20.68]It's kind of annoying, but we'll see.
[62:24.32]I'm alright.
[62:25.63]I'll tighten it a little bit at the next mission.
[62:33.57]Jesus Christ, I love elephants.
[62:34.89]I know, it's great.
[62:36.73]Gotta be careful, here we go.
[62:44.70]Somebody in here.
[62:53.40]I lost control of the stream on that one.
[63:00.93]Alright, what about the plates?
[63:08.12]What do I need?
[63:09.14]2,500?
[63:09.16]How many watts do I need?
[63:12.39]What else is new?
[63:15.89]I've lost control of the stream.
[63:18.19]Eh, it's a typical Saturday then.
[63:34.30]Alright, here we go.
[63:34.78]Turn it on.
[63:50.30]This is for the Wii.
[63:51.50]What system is it for?
[63:52.16]It's for the Wii.
[63:57.90]Oh, shit.
[63:58.18]I can go over there.
[63:58.92]Wait.
[63:59.16]Can I move this?
[64:02.80]Alright.
[64:03.66]That's slow.
[64:09.86]TV is now energized.
[64:10.94]Got a pink one?
[64:15.42]This is a lot.
[64:19.76]Oh shit.
[64:20.66]One sec.
[64:21.06]He's killing them.
[64:21.80]Hold on.
[64:48.15]Where am I going?
[64:48.87]I'm just chan- I'm just tightening the back.
[64:54.47]What's he wearing?
[64:55.21]Heh heh.
[64:57.93]Here we go.
[65:04.20]There we are.
[65:05.78]One more- one more side.
[65:08.94]Don't hurt yourself playing the game.
[65:10.28]No, I'm alright, I'm just... This morning too, I was- it was actually
[65:15.33]I woke up worse this morning, but... I'll be fine.
[65:23.99]Invite Bugleberry to play with you.
[65:28.61]No, not giving up.
[65:31.54]There we go, that's better.
[65:37.22]Quick invite Frog Detective.
[65:41.74]Where's this TV?
[65:57.47]None of this shit is able to be... Nothing in here is breakable, it's fine.
[66:03.57]Alright, new door, new door.
[66:06.39]I broke something.
[66:07.11]What did I break?
[66:11.01]Let Bugleberry play instead.
[66:14.33]No, if I... If I... You guys know me, man.
[66:17.49]If it gets to be too much of me, I'll just see you tomorrow.
[66:21.71]You know that.
[66:22.07]It's happened once before.
[66:28.22]You can't break a picture, right?
[66:38.61]Bugleberry- No, Bugleberry's not gonna play this!
[66:43.21]He's not even good at this game.
[66:53.46]That was, like, angry how hard I threw that.
[66:56.09]I picked that up off of my head and fucking just whipped it into the wall.
[66:58.83]Alright, there's another door I can go on.
[67:10.58]Let's turn this on.
[67:11.10]Alright.
[67:16.13]Don't break that vase.
[67:17.11]Easy.
[67:25.96]Can I move these yet?
[67:30.91]Alright, nothing breakable in there.
[67:33.27]That's fine.
[67:34.57]Oh shit, they're on the wall.
[67:49.51]Come on!
[67:52.79]Do it!
[67:56.22]Where are the Ellie bits?
[68:01.00]Oh!
[68:11.07]Oh, get me back out there!
[68:13.01]I just heard it.
[68:14.33]Where are they?
[68:15.57]Alright, watch out.
[68:41.87]Boil it.
[68:42.23]Energize.
[68:44.77]Energize.
[68:55.16]Energize.
[68:55.58]Good.
[69:07.87]I'm not trying to pull it off.
[69:11.66]Where's the heater?
[69:12.14]Alright, let's do the cookie right in the middle.
[69:25.97]Heater energized.
[69:26.87]Heater energized.
[69:27.85]It's right here, right?
[69:28.65]There it is.
[69:29.97]30 seconds, fuck.
[69:33.50]I can't move the boxes yet.
[69:42.19]Give a stop.
[69:42.75]You're breaking our marriage?
[69:43.95]$3,500 to turn this on.
[69:45.89]Shit.
[69:46.07]Okay, we're fine.
[69:50.37]Ha!
[70:23.76]It's the worst thing to do right now.
[70:25.22]It's like sneeze.
[70:40.93]He's getting sicker!
[70:42.14]I'M FINE!
[70:52.62]I sneezed once!
[70:55.94]I was here because he sneezed?
[71:00.58]I still haven't beat the fucking level.
[71:03.53]No, I'm saying it's bad because, like, that, like, detracts my chest muscles and chest and shit.
[71:36.59]Where is he?
[71:41.45]Wait, somebody out here.
[71:50.73]I'm breaking in.
[71:55.50]Why is it so hard for me to open a door?
[72:01.12]We're done for.
[72:10.26]I'm gonna lose.
[72:14.73]Sometimes you gotta crack a few fucking eggs to make your breakfast in the morning.
[72:20.19]Whatever it is.
[72:20.77]You know what I'm saying?
[72:24.23]How can there be only two of you in here?
[72:34.92]How did I move the bed?
[72:41.67]No, move the bed.
[72:42.97]How did I move the bed so much?
[72:47.01]Motherfucker.
[72:50.82]Air purifier.
[72:51.44]Where?
[72:51.66]There it is.
[72:53.08]30 seconds.
[72:53.48]Shit, I'm gonna lose.
[72:54.80]I need 3,000, right?
[73:21.29]Turn on, come on, come on, hurry up, please.
[73:34.06]Where are they?
[73:41.72]Get out of there!
[73:42.34]Where the fuck are- what?
[73:48.27]I think I lose.
[73:58.43]Oh, I got it.
[73:58.89]Thank God.
[73:59.19]I got it.
[74:06.94]Hey, I'm from the future.
[74:07.58]Jerma doesn't do it.
[74:08.34]Well, you must be from the wrong future.
[74:12.18]I'll get what I can in 15 seconds.
[74:19.07]Didn't get to go in the other room.
[74:28.00]At least I got to go in the bathroom.
[74:31.48]Wrong timeline.
[74:36.70]Jeremiah, I beat Mario.
[74:37.66]Are you proud of me?
[74:38.70]Of course I am.
[74:39.48]It's a really hard game.
[74:51.83]Keep touching your face.
[75:02.80]But I'm like... I know, I really shouldn't be doing that.
[75:05.96]But I've been washing my hands.
[75:07.62]Alright, we get to do the kitchen.
[75:09.46]I'm gonna do the kitchen mission.
[75:12.20]Sure, I'll do a tutorial.
[75:18.87]Quick, you're losing them.
[75:19.77]More piss jokes.
[75:25.65]So, you make noises.
[75:26.49]You don't want to make too much noise.
[75:29.64]The volume gauge will fill as you make noise.
[75:32.40]When a certain line is passed, the count will decrease.
[75:35.24]Zero is a mission failure.
[75:38.10]So, don't make noise.
[75:41.42]Don't let him run around.
[75:42.31]Okay.
[75:44.47]I get it.
[75:44.77]Hey, we got a cutscene.
[75:46.59]Okay.
[75:48.51]Kai, are you okay?
[75:50.80]Your mom and I are looking into what has been happening around the world.
[75:56.16]Whatever it is, it's causing all the Elevates to act pretty strangely.
[76:01.71]It's not safe.
[76:03.37]You'd better take my capture gun.
[76:06.08]I already have it, Dad.
[76:07.99]I just didn't tell anyone.
[76:09.35]You better take my gun.
[76:11.01]But be careful with that gun.
[76:13.57]It breaks easily.
[76:15.75]Now, I'm busy.
[76:17.37]Gotta go.
[76:19.06]I'm busy, gotta go.
[76:20.46]Dad isn't going to come home?
[76:23.18]Isn't he worried about me?
[76:27.18]Huh?
[76:27.98]What's that sound?
[76:29.02]Be careful with that gun.
[76:30.45]The dad was just doing a tuber voice.
[76:34.33]Okay.
[76:35.45]Be sure when you have that Elliebits thing, you don't fire it too quickly.
[76:40.63]I gotta go.
[76:43.97]See ya in the next episode.
[76:45.33]That's TTS voice?
[76:52.07]That is TTS voice.
[76:56.85]Alright, the silent kitchen.
[76:58.41]After 4,000 watts.
[77:02.13]Oh, I can... Hold on a minute.
[77:03.07]I'm gonna save that...
[77:11.41]Puppy.
[77:19.03]It's just bread, man.
[77:19.77]Why would it take- Why would it be- It's not that loud.
[77:21.94]Why is- Why is bread this loud?
[77:26.58]Oh, I dropped a fucking pot on the ground.
[77:31.32]Oh shits, what are you doing?
[77:38.08]Noise canceller.
[77:38.92]Ellipis won't hear noises.
[77:40.16]Okay.
[77:47.86]I have an idea.
[77:56.15]Homing laser.
[77:56.87]Yeah.
[77:57.46]Here we go.
[78:28.67]Oh shit, they can hear noises again.
[78:32.63]I just, I was passing out, and you know when you're passing the fuck out, and then you lie down for a second and the world starts to come back?
[78:43.50]That's just what that felt like.
[78:44.48]Oh, I have to insert what?
[78:50.11]Insert coffee.
[78:50.77]Insert toast!
[78:51.29]Insert toast in the toaster.
[79:42.94]Is it not toast?
[79:46.64]Where's the coffee maker?
[79:47.62]Fuck.
[79:48.08]Alright, it's right here.
[79:48.97]Oh, this is gonna be insanely difficult to do this.
[80:02.39]Got it!
[80:03.49]Alright.
[80:07.28]I can't get the fucking toast in there.
[80:08.38]It's gonna take too long.
[80:11.36]What do I need to put in the oven?
[80:18.48]Insert what?
[80:19.04]There's already a turkey in there.
[80:20.43]TTF.
[81:00.62]There we go, come on, get level two.
[81:08.83]I still can't get this fucking toast in here.
[81:10.75]Dude, there's no way you're gonna get this toast in there.
[81:26.51]Cancel all sounds.
[81:44.01]Okay.
[81:45.15]Throw the pizza fucking everywhere.
[81:46.41]Break everything.
[81:49.21]Alright, give me the homing missile.
[82:18.24]I'm gonna beat it right here.
[82:18.86]Got it.
[82:24.98]What's the goal of this game?
[82:25.78]It's to capture Ellie bits, and transfer them into energy, and then use the energy to open doors in your house.
[82:31.58]And turn your lights back on.
[82:32.39]Get this ready.
[82:40.87]Five, four, three, two, one...
[82:48.81]That felt fucking good.
[82:50.49]Level 3, don't make noise.
[82:53.09]Alright, what needs to go in here?
[82:55.07]What do you put in the microwave?
[82:57.65]Uh, what goes in the microwave?
[82:58.99]What kind of food is on the floor?
[83:02.22]Onion.
[83:03.18]Apple?
[83:05.10]Bread?
[83:23.91]No, no, no, stop.
[83:32.00]Aluminum foil.
[83:36.76]It's like a front loading dishwasher.
[83:39.28]Mustard.
[83:51.43]You motherfucker!
[83:52.57]Open and stay open!
[83:54.63]Stay open!
[83:55.57]Okay.
[84:17.16]Oh my fucking god.
[84:19.42]Stay open!
[84:21.31]Stay open!
[84:25.61]Every microwave does this shit, and it's so irritating.
[84:29.87]This is actually what happens when you have a real micro- But this is a- This really happens.
[84:34.15]Stop doing that!
[84:35.45]Why do they- Why does it do that shit?
[84:38.42]This is not a game problem, this is like- That's a real world problem.
[84:49.04]Oh fuck, I can't make noise.
[84:52.87]It's upside down.
[84:54.21]What the fuck do I put in here?
[84:55.51]Bread?
[84:57.18]What about the turkey?
[84:57.92]Should I put the turkey in there?
[84:58.82]How long would it take to microwave a full turkey?
[85:12.75]Okay, it takes like four and a half hours to bake a turkey in the oven.
[85:17.59]If you microwave the turkey from raw,
[85:23.33]How long would it take?
[85:40.02]I can't move, otherwise I'm going to fail the mission.
[85:44.20]Wait, Mr. Bean did that?
[85:47.98]Wait.
[85:50.62]Where'd you go?
[85:51.04]Where'd you go?
[85:51.38]Where'd you go?
[85:52.28]I know.
[85:54.69]Wait, Mr. Bean really did that?
[85:56.17]He microwaved a whole turkey?
[86:02.63]That's... That's very, very... That's very funny.
[86:07.06]That's very funny.
[86:20.14]What should I put in there?
[86:27.67]I don't want to make any noise.
[86:32.03]Link the funny turkey video.
[86:40.54]Don't make any noise.
[86:41.62]Please just pick it up.
[86:57.69]I'm going for a C. Wait, it's real.

[89:42.89]How are we watching each other on each other's TV?
[89:52.80]This is nice.
[89:57.64]Doctor, there is something we have to talk about.
[90:02.39]This looks new.
[90:04.87]I don't quite know how to put this.
[90:08.74]What I am concerned about is... This is new?
[90:11.74]Whoever that is, I am getting rid of them.
[90:15.22]That's the guy from Ghostbusters 2.
[90:16.22]There he is.
[90:17.70]Dave.
[90:23.36]I love this guy.
[90:26.21]Terrible.
[90:26.71]You couldn't believe it.
[90:28.43]It's just the way she... It's the green.
[90:31.51]No, it's the yellow.
[90:33.75]It's just the yellow.
[90:35.52]She is a... Well, where is Allison?
[90:38.34]Well, I've got some bad news and some good news.
[90:42.28]The bad news is that Allison has had to go visit her mom, who, well, is not well.
[90:48.64]That's too bad.
[90:49.96]Is this from a movie?
[90:51.55]The good news is that Dr. Bean and I will be cooking.
[90:55.67]Oh.
[90:56.09]But he's Dr. Bean?
[90:57.51]Of course it is.
[91:00.03]All the greatest chefs in the world are men.
[91:02.21]So what's on the menu, maestro?
[91:12.01]What are we going to do?
[91:13.33]Yes, I think they may be expecting something slightly more formal.
[91:20.27]Hot dog.
[91:21.05]Just on its own?
[91:22.15]No, no, don't be ridiculous.
[91:26.02]That's for Thanksgiving.
[91:26.88]Allison would kill me.
[91:27.76]Microwave the raw turkey.
[91:29.18]It must be something else.
[91:30.20]Have you ever cooked one of these before?
[91:35.66]Oh, yes.
[91:37.32]But I mean, what would they take?
[91:38.32]Like five hours, right?
[91:40.60]Not necessarily.
[91:45.47]The fucking what?
[91:49.13]Why?
[91:51.45]How long did they do this for?
[91:53.13]20 minutes.
[91:54.63]I don't know.
[91:56.29]20 fucking minutes.
[91:58.05]No, I'm not hungry.
[92:00.30]You're the chef.
[92:00.82]Just put on some vegetables.
[92:01.84]Wait, is this a bean video game?
[92:06.69]Holy shit, that's disgusting.
[92:09.73]Maestro, my taste buds are positively tingling with anticipation.
[92:15.97]Play the Mr. Bean game.
[92:22.67]Oh, no thanks.
[92:24.17]I would actually eat those.
[92:25.13]I would eat those.
[92:25.67]They look good.
[92:26.69]I actually kind of like raw onions.
[92:27.95]I'm a fucking weirdo.
[92:29.71]So, Bean, big day Tuesday.
[92:33.50]Your big day.
[92:34.56]My big day.
[92:37.06]I have a question for you.
[92:37.76]Let's see what it looks like.
[92:45.22]He's very attentive to detail.
[92:49.28]Everything must be just so.
[92:58.88]What?
[92:59.54]Is he alright?
[93:00.76]Is Mr. Bean okay?
[93:10.36]Dean, I think we need to be honest with each other.
[93:14.20]I cannot deny that over the last days, some suspicions have begun to gather in my mind, and I would just like to ask you some direct questions.
[93:26.51]Okay.
[93:28.33]Number one, are you a doctor?
[93:32.01]Okay.
[93:38.54]I can't do that.
[93:46.33]Why are you watching Mr. Bean?
[93:47.85]This is a fake gamer stream.
[93:49.47]I can't... I gotta take a break, man.
[93:55.07]I'm fucking... I'm in pain.
[93:58.21]Watch the whole movie.
[93:59.23]I can't watch this whole movie on stream.
[94:00.77]I'll get removed from Twitch.
[94:12.18]Fake react channel.
[94:15.05]Just watch all the clips in order.
[94:17.71]No, you can't do that.
[94:20.71]I can't just watch every scene from Mr. Bean the movie in separate YouTube videos back to back.
[94:28.00]I mean, that's skirting the rules a little, and I would probably get reprimanded for something like that.
[94:35.88]Give me another Mr. Bean clip.
[94:37.68]I want to watch a funny Mr. Bean clip.
[94:40.00]Any other funny classic Mr. Bean clips?
[95:04.77]Alright, here we go.
[95:07.45]Let's take a look.
[95:10.87]You got one here?
[95:12.73]What's this one?
[95:17.58]I know that's a gnome.
[95:20.56]Here comes a bean stream.
[95:22.92]This is the Crispus Turkey funny clip.
[95:25.34]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[95:27.68]Wait a second.
[95:28.16]Wait a minute.
[95:28.50]Wait, wait, wait.
[95:28.92]There's more than one Mr. Bean funny Thanksgiving turkey clip?
[95:46.72]Hold on, there's more than one?
[95:48.42]I'm going to see if there's a Mr. Bean turkey clip that's available.
[96:19.87]Mr. Bean does... It's just classic Mr. Bean comedy.
[96:34.18]This is classic fucking Mr. Bean comedy.
[96:35.94]Yeah!
[97:19.92]Merry Christmas.
[97:25.36]Is he feeding the mouse Christmas cheese?
[97:27.38]Oh!
[97:28.92]Holy shit, Mr. Bean.
[97:32.22]Merry Christmas.
[97:50.43]That looks like a fucking folded up person.
[98:16.11]That's a human.
[98:18.01]This is a human.
[98:23.51]Holy shit, that's a huge fucking turkey!
[98:28.00]That's a person!

[99:15.59]He's going to have to jump.
[99:17.23]Of course, he's going to walk.
[99:19.01]It's fucking a headcrab.
[99:21.78]It's one of those scientists from Half-Life.
[99:25.52]Holy shit, that's what it would look like if it was in real life.
[99:28.62]Holy fuck, that's terrifying.

[100:52.06]One last one.
[100:52.56]This one.
[100:52.84]This one.
[100:53.34]Found it.
[100:53.68]Found it.
[100:53.96]Found it.
[100:58.72]That's not it.
[101:02.68]This is a turkey one.
[101:05.22]Please watch this one.
[101:06.40]Should have watched this during Thanksgiving.
[101:10.28]You guys are all linking such random shit.
[101:11.87]These aren't even Mr. Bean.
[101:15.19]Seafood Bean.
[101:17.51]Mr. Bean.
[101:18.25]No, no, no.
[101:21.45]This is the one.
[101:22.07]This is the best one.
[101:30.46]This is one of the French restaurants.
[101:33.86]I love this one.
[101:39.18]No, it's got to be food related.
[101:40.39]Seafood is the best one.
[101:41.81]Alright.
[101:46.99]Alright, every time people... Half of these... Okay, somebody just linked the scene where Ace Ventura comes out of the rhino's ass.
[101:54.12]That has nothing to do with Mr. Bean.
[101:57.06]It's like, honest to God, what the fuck are you talking about?
[102:06.34]Is this it?
[102:11.94]No, that's not it.
[102:13.69]It's like a turkey video.
[102:20.35]Okay, here we go.
[102:21.41]Somebody got it.
[102:22.45]Somebody got it.
[102:23.15]Somebody got it.
[102:24.97]Thank you so much.
[102:26.75]Thank you.
[102:27.51]Here we go.
[102:32.87]Hey.
[102:33.63]Oh, you don't know about Sprite Ginger?
[102:55.57]He lost his... Wait, is this the same video?
[102:58.65]He lost his wad.
[103:01.15]It's the same fucking thing.
[103:10.13]It's the same wad.
[103:11.05]I love it.
[103:20.30]There's just no laugh track on this one.
[103:24.93]Now, listen, David, I want a straight answer.
[103:27.05]What do you think about the mayor?
[103:28.73]You know, maybe I should just go in and help.
[103:31.65]No, please sit down.
[103:33.84]The doctor is in complete control of the situation.
[103:41.02]You see, the problem with the mayor is that... Well, how can I put this kindly?
[103:48.35]He's a total idiot.
[103:54.00]It's just leadership, vision, vision.
[103:57.73]I don't think you're gonna get that from some compromised career politician.
[104:01.75]Which is why George should be running for office.
[104:04.07]This is the Jerma stream.
[104:04.99]Excuse me.
[104:05.95]This is the Jerma stream?
[104:06.99]You fellas alright in there?
[104:09.76]Yes, thanks.
[104:25.92]Put some vegetables on.
[104:31.20]Come and say hello.
[104:34.14]Is this the same movie?
[104:35.54]Is this the same one?
[104:59.67]You found another turkey one?
[105:03.13]Is this actually another turkey one?
[105:07.34]That's not a...
[105:35.71]The world isn't black and white.
[105:38.93]There's no set.
[105:39.57]Oh, hangnail.
[105:59.40]Separate two eggs.
[106:00.52]Please go on his head.
[106:01.72]Please go on his head.
[106:05.86]Go on his head and have him run around and hit walls and shit, please.
[106:11.70]Right.
[106:15.01]A pinch of salt.
[106:21.85]Half a dozen oysters.
[106:25.31]Oh, they forgot to clean this one.
[106:33.04]What are you doing?
[106:35.02]It's a germistry.
[106:37.68]A can of peas.
[106:40.38]It's a germistry.
[106:41.30]We just say things that we're doing and then we do the same thing over and over again.
[106:47.19]Oh, can of peas.
[106:48.91]A couple of oysters.
[106:50.75]A dozen oysters.
[106:52.21]Can of peas.
[107:00.85]It's classic humor.
[107:01.90]It works.
[107:04.46]Oh my god, he's gonna get stuck.
[107:12.57]That's it?
[107:12.93]That can't be it.
[107:15.37]What do you mean, that's it?
[107:20.25]There's another classic turkey one.
[107:48.29]Phoebe?
[107:49.29]Joey?
[107:49.55]What's going on?
[107:51.55]Get off the screen.
[107:54.41]Oh, my God!
[107:56.43]I know.
[107:58.69]It's stuck.
[108:00.09]Okay.
[108:01.81]Dad, how did you get on?
[108:04.41]I put it on to scare Chandler.
[108:06.19]Oh, my God!
[108:08.39]Monica's gonna totally freak out.
[108:10.51]Well, then help me get it off.
[108:12.21]Plus, it smells really bad in here.
[108:15.46]Of course it smells really bad.
[108:16.84]You have your head up a dead animal.
[108:38.23]Okay, this is gonna be...
[108:44.70]I don't want to know what you fucking did.
[108:49.10]It's gonna be the exact same thing.
[109:16.71]Shit, that was pretty sick.
[109:22.34]That was the microwave.
[109:23.26]What the fuck?
[109:23.86]You gotta do the same thing.
[109:29.24]Didn't I have to take a bath?
[109:32.34]French fries and turkey.
[109:41.34]But it didn't go on his head.
[109:42.26]This isn't funny.
[109:43.85]I don't find his humor.
[109:44.69]It just got on his head raw.
[109:55.56]I swear to God, I fucking promise you, there will be a time, not today, not tomorrow, not next week,
[110:02.94]I will do a fucking... Look at how funny it is.
[110:06.58]The turkey's on his head.
[110:07.66]I'm going to stuff a turkey, Joe.
[110:09.90]I promise.
[110:10.60]What the fuck is going on?
[110:28.47]Aurora Borealis.
[110:32.21]Smithers, whatever your fucking name is.
[111:02.20]This is not even supposed to be as funny as the actual jerky joke.
[111:16.47]He's breathing in the smoke.
[111:18.74]Dude, that wasn't even, like, funny.
[111:22.60]Yeah, that, like, that kind of sucked, to be honest with you.
[111:32.70]Okay, that's enough turkey videos for now.
[111:38.06]That's enough.
[111:50.19]No more turkey.
[111:52.27]No, no, no more turkeys.
[111:58.69]No, I'm not playing the other one.
[112:00.39]No, this one, I don't want to play this one.
[112:02.39]No, he doesn't even do anything funny with this.
[112:05.37]He's just holding it in his hands.
[112:11.82]Watch this, please.
[112:12.86]Watch this.
[112:15.50]This is toilet humor, Mr. Bean.
[112:16.92]We're not watching Mr. Bean piss it into a urinal.
[112:23.66]The last one, please.
[112:26.02]Hold on.
[112:29.47]Oh, okay, fine.
[112:40.16]Do people still think that's funny?
[112:43.16]How many of you guys, do people still think that that's funny?
[112:49.05]Oh, the turkey joke.
[112:50.45]Oh, it's just like a Jerma stream.
[112:51.97]He does that kind of same shit every time.
[112:54.42]Let's link the streamer.
[112:57.18]The fucking gnome video every stream.
[113:00.00]You and I are not so different.
[113:04.04]Hey, click this link.
[113:04.94]It's the, it's the, I think this is funny still.
[113:07.46]We're not so different, you and I. Why don't we do the lyrics?
[113:23.74]No, I'm not watching any more turkey videos.
[113:27.40]That was a good break.
[113:32.02]Okay.
[113:33.52]Now, what do I want to do now?
[113:38.62]No more chicken videos.
[113:47.05]Cleaned your room.
[113:52.22]Let me stand up for a second.
[113:54.16]Let's actually take just an actual BRB.
[113:56.52]I want to stand up and move around.
[113:58.84]Just a little bit.
[114:01.06]I think I'm going to take the brace off.
[114:03.70]And just move around a little.
[114:05.46]Give me one second.
[114:08.12]I will be right back.
[114:09.96]I'm going to take this off.
[115:32.11]Alright.
[115:33.43]I've moved up and down a little.
[115:35.82]Um... I don't want to say this, but I'm going to.
[115:40.62]I'm gonna have to call it here.
[115:43.92]I'm sorry.
[115:45.88]I gotta, like... I don't know what I gotta do.
[115:48.69]Go lie down or something?
[115:54.31]This is, uh, hopefully not gonna start happening more frequently, because this happened, like, a few weeks ago, where it just, like, I couldn't do anything, and I was just uncomfortable.
[116:02.99]So I'm just going to call it.
[116:05.11]I'm not going to push it.
[116:07.32]I don't want to.
[116:09.14]Sorry, we only have like a three and a half hour.
[116:10.86]We'll probably four hour stream.
[116:15.02]But I'll be back tomorrow.
[116:17.74]Tomorrow is going to be an interesting day because I'm going to play a game that is on the GameCube that is a microphone game.
[116:25.35]I don't know if you want to miss this one.
[116:27.07]It's a microphone based video game.
[116:35.87]It is called Odama.
[116:38.41]You control an army with your voice while you throw a boulder into buildings.
[116:47.20]It's going to be a little weird.
[116:51.00]But sorry that the last probably full hour or so, I just have not been that comfortable.
[116:57.91]And I really just want to kind of just, unfortunately, I have to stop.
[117:05.12]It started once I started playing, like, Elevates.
[117:08.97]I think it's just the way that I was holding and just how I felt earlier today.
[117:14.87]So, I will see you tomorrow.
[117:18.06]I'll make sure to, like,
[117:20.01]I don't know what to do tomorrow, but I'll try to rest up and make it so I can sit here longer.
[117:25.10]Because I was fine.
[117:26.18]This is the thing that's so annoying about this.
[117:29.48]It's like yesterday.
[117:31.28]I was live for like eight fucking hours yesterday.
[117:33.89]And I was like, fine.
[117:35.15]I didn't need the brace.
[117:35.93]And then I woke up today and it was just like, fuck.
[117:37.79]It like hurts.
[117:39.23]Put the brace on.
[117:40.03]It helped a little bit.
[117:40.91]But you know what I mean?
[117:42.19]It's like, come on, man.
[117:42.91]Like, that's annoying.
[117:48.08]But we'll see you tomorrow.
[117:49.98]We'll do it again tomorrow.
[117:51.27]I'm going to play Odama.
[117:52.03]And I'll see you then.
[117:58.61]Could it be the weather?
[117:59.41]No, I don't think so.
[118:02.13]I don't think so.
[118:05.62]But we'll see you tomorrow.
[118:11.22]Does he know that he needs a mic?
[118:12.82]Oh, I have a mic.
[118:14.64]Actually, you know what?
[118:15.46]Let me see.
[118:16.28]Make sure it's in here.
[118:19.57]Here it is.
[118:22.77]Oh, it's in here, alright.
[118:23.61]I have to... Hold on, I actually want to show this.
[118:31.43]So... Here is the GameCube Nintendo microphone.
[118:45.38]It's in the package still.
[118:48.35]Let's take it out.
[118:53.08]Here you go.
[118:54.60]Hello.
[118:56.63]And apparently this does work in here.
[118:58.15]Did I just ruin this by putting my dirty fingers all over it?
[119:06.31]What else can you use this with?
[119:09.22]I don't know.
[119:09.64]Apparently it works in the Wii.
[119:11.98]I know.
[119:12.32]I'm going to make sure it works before I turn the stream on.
[119:16.64]Check the disc.
[119:17.32]Check the disc.
[119:19.96]Why does this have to be a thing?
[119:21.11]Why do I have to make sure this shit's in here?
[119:24.91]Here it is, Odama.
[119:27.69]Oh yeah, it's in there.
[119:28.69]This is like a really sleek case, too.
[119:31.51]Got live unboxing?
[119:32.51]Here you go.
[119:34.63]There it is.
[119:34.93]It's a nice case.
[119:37.77]Take a look in here.
[119:39.14]It's like a really nice case.
[119:41.08]It's got the manual, too.
[119:43.70]Pretty nice case.
[119:44.30]This looks big for a GameCube game.
[119:48.70]Doesn't it look kind of big?
[119:54.99]Does it look bigger?
[119:59.04]I don't know, maybe.
[120:00.38]But that's the plan tomorrow.
[120:01.76]Everything's in here, so that's good.
[120:04.28]If you missed the stream today, my body hurt.
[120:07.60]I got scammed.
[120:08.90]And we watched Mr. Bean stuff his head in a turkey four times.
[120:13.74]Pretty good Saturday.
[120:14.60]Pretty good Saturday stream.
[120:17.40]I think so.
[120:18.94]So I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[120:20.66]Have a great rest of your day.
[120:23.77]And we'll see you tomorrow.
[120:28.72]Thanks for the ketchup.
[120:35.21]Sorry for Rick rolling you.
[120:44.33]Classic fucking food mishap video.
[120:47.90]I love it so much.
[120:51.24]Take care guys.
[120:51.80]See you tomorrow.
[120:52.44]We'll do the bits.
[120:53.38]I'll hang out for a little bit.
[120:59.74]Let's go over here.
[121:02.96]So, earlier we had, uh, we had Spigot the Bear for $5.
[121:07.18]Thank you for the 500 bits.
[121:07.96]Hey, Jerma, as a verified 2006 gamer and god skater, do you think you would ever stream Bully?
[121:14.58]You could do the Wii version for some boomer exercise.
[121:20.04]Um...
[121:23.33]I don't know.
[121:23.81]Aren't they making another one?
[121:24.78]Aren't they, like, remaking it or something?
[121:26.98]I heard they were, like, redoing it.
[121:29.80]Or there was going to be a second one, or... I'm kind of just waiting on that.
[121:34.38]Not confirmed.
[121:35.34]Oh.
[121:37.00]They aren't?
[121:37.60]Oh.
[121:38.46]It got cancelled.
[121:39.40]Oh.
[121:40.68]Oh.
[121:43.86]Cancelled.
[121:44.46]Oh, okay.
[121:49.03]There's been so many rumors about Politu.
[121:51.27]Yeah.
[121:53.64]Now I've played Bully.
[121:54.36]I played it a long time ago.
[121:57.36]But maybe.
[121:58.08]Let's get through all this stuff first.
[121:59.64]I still have a bunch of stuff that I want to play and try on the Wii and the GameCube.
[122:03.78]Some classic, some not so classic.
[122:06.64]Obviously, I still have Eternal Darkness that I want to play.
[122:09.98]Which, that's a classic.
[122:11.26]That's going to be really fun.
[122:13.30]Both of Beautiful Joes, No More Heroes 2.
[122:14.96]Those still have to come up and be done.
[122:22.64]When can we expect more Cabela's?
[122:25.01]Never.
[122:27.13]But thanks for the $5.
[122:29.55]Bulbaswag, thanks for the 500 bits.
[122:31.14]With the coronavirus, Clown of the Town would have a new risk factor.
[122:37.36]Clown of the Town is just impossible to do without 500 million dollars.
[122:41.30]I followed just for Cabela's.
[122:42.66]Well, I'm sorry.
[122:43.60]You probably should unfollow if you followed for Cabela's.
[122:46.09]Because that is the first and only time you will ever see a Cabela's video game streamed on this stream.
[122:55.35]It's not going to happen probably ever again.
[122:57.39]Unless... Unless I get scammed again.
[123:01.24]And somebody puts the wrong disc into a game that I purchased.
[123:08.94]So if I buy, like, Raving Rabbids again, and there's a Cabela's 2006 disc in there, sure.
[123:19.71]Fucking got scammed.
[123:21.33]Well, I keep getting scammed with these used games.
[123:25.39]And that was live.
[123:27.03]That was a live, I got fucking scammed.
[123:30.69]I can't believe it.
[123:32.05]I'm so annoyed by that.
[123:40.92]send up a cabinet what a sucker hello again mister thanks for the 250 hey Jerm I just came back from Portugal where I got to see my girlfriend for the first time in a while when I got back I had to go into quarantine where I'll be for 14 days getting back home to your stream made the situation easier to bear thank you so much hopefully um you're good to go
[124:06.60]Kind of a scary time right now with just uncertainty in what exactly this is and what it does.
[124:16.05]It is kind of at that point right now where we're trying to ease the amount of infections
[124:23.06]As much as we can, I guess.
[124:24.81]So, just be careful.
[124:26.13]Take care of yourselves.
[124:28.03]Stay, obviously, stay clean.
[124:30.67]Wash your hands.
[124:31.27]Don't go anywhere.
[124:32.07]You don't have to go.
[124:33.67]That has a lot of people there.
[124:35.89]I mean, this is just basic stuff.
[124:38.79]Unless for a little while, right?
[124:44.54]Yeah, it's not a joke.
[124:46.34]It's no joke.
[124:46.94]You gotta be careful.
[124:54.74]Why did you cancel E3?
[124:56.29]I was looking for... I didn't have... What?
[124:58.19]I'm a guy that sits in his underwear and watches it and, like, drinks coffee and, like... I have nothing to do with you.
[125:06.55]What are you talking about?
[125:09.79]Hey, Cybeck, thanks for the $15, Cybeck.
[125:11.69]Here, do you want to take some money to never do that fucking Woody bit again?
[125:16.15]Well, I can't promise that won't happen.
[125:18.48]Considering how many turkey mishaps you've seen on this stream, I'm sure you'll see it again soon.
[125:24.80]Thanks for the $15.
[125:25.50]I appreciate it.
[125:28.08]Hey, Smellyboy, thanks for the $2.50.
[125:31.22]I'm not kidding when I say Big Game Hunter 2005 was the first game I ever played when I was like 7 on my PlayStation 2.
[125:36.86]It made me so happy when you started playing it.
[125:40.86]It made me so happy when you got scammed.
[125:44.12]Can you imagine sitting here watching a stream and it's like, hey, I'm going to play Raving Rabbids.
[125:48.92]It's like, oh, okay, I guess that's what he's going to play.
[125:51.38]And I opened the case and it's, holy shit, it's the first game you've ever played.
[125:58.05]Like, tricked you.
[125:59.71]We're on Egypt and I'm playing Cabela's.
[126:02.01]And it's like, whoa, that's the first thing I've ever done.
[126:04.39]That's just weird, isn't it?
[126:13.02]That's like a moment for one person.
[126:15.48]That's the one guy.
[126:16.18]Thanks for the 250, though.
[126:23.73]Holy shit.
[126:23.93]You hold all the power.
[126:42.69]Oh, man.
[126:44.63]That's a lot of power that you hold.
[126:51.15]The nimble pickle thanks for the $15.
[126:52.55]It was my birthday yesterday, and I just want to say thank you for six plus years of entertainment.
[126:58.22]Also, when do you plan on playing Viva Pinata again?
[127:00.30]It was a great stream, and we want more.
[127:03.66]Um, after this weekend, I would say.
[127:09.34]So... Probably...
[127:13.31]I might... We've done a lot of Wii and GameCube stuff.
[127:17.07]I'll probably go back to the Xbox.
[127:21.05]But also, next week is Animal Crossing.
[127:24.62]And I'm playing Animal Crossing.
[127:27.00]Absolutely, at least around... Somewhere around when it launches.
[127:30.96]So, what I'll probably end up doing is... We'll probably do some Xbox stuff.
[127:37.81]Starting on Wednesday.
[127:40.03]And then we'll do Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday or something.
[127:43.91]And we'll do a couple of Xbox games.
[127:46.21]And then I'm going to play Animal Crossing for a couple days at least.
[127:50.34]When it comes out.
[127:53.68]We'll see.
[127:54.52]That's the plan.
[128:01.22]Thank you for the 15 bucks.
[128:02.00]Wait.
[128:05.91]Wait.
[128:07.80]Oh, I thought you said Animal Crossing's not shipping until April.
[128:10.49]I was like, no way, what, really?
[128:15.46]Smellyboy, thanks for the $2.50.
[128:17.68]Thank you for playing Big Game Hunter, even if it wasn't for long.
[128:20.21]It was hilarious watching you play.
[128:22.11]Just listening to the sounds and watching you chase the werewolves.
[128:25.55]Wolverines.
[128:27.11]Gave me such a nostalgia trip and had me laughing so hard.
[128:29.85]I've been sick the past few days and very afraid because of it.
[128:33.18]Your streams are always a light in the darkness.
[128:35.70]Love you, man.
[128:36.48]Keep up the good work and let's hope all this stuff passes soon.
[128:38.80]I agree.
[128:40.28]I agree.
[128:44.68]I agree.
[128:45.22]I remember when I first started watching Jerma with his Super Meat Boy Let's Play.
[128:52.14]I was pretty good at that game.
[128:54.39]I did all the Dark World levels and all the Bandage Girls levels.
[129:02.03]So, come on.
[129:06.54]Thanks, Melly Boy.
[129:07.28]Take care of yourself.
[129:08.48]Hopefully it's nothing serious, right?
[129:09.92]Hopefully it's not anything to be concerned about.
[129:14.11]LM, man, thanks for the 500 bits.
[129:15.29]Jerma, you are king.
[129:19.82]Thank you.
[129:22.78]10Mario, or 10Mari10, thanks for the 300 bits.
[129:26.46]I had a dream that you were streaming some game when your cam accidentally turned on and you were standing fully nude in the shower.
[129:33.34]Chat kept saying TOS and penis, but you didn't notice.
[129:36.04]I feel like this is an omen.
[129:37.90]I've had that dream twice.
[129:39.51]So, trust me, I'm aware of it.
[129:47.83]Uh, you posted cringe, bro.
[129:49.07]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[129:50.29]You're losing them quick.
[129:51.13]More piss jokes.
[129:51.93]I read it earlier, but I thought it was kind of funny.
[129:55.91]Uh, you posted cringe, bro.
[129:59.07]Gave another $25.
[129:59.79]And they say, Jerma, you worried about the coronavirus with you being a boomer?
[130:05.87]Cringe.
[130:08.73]And they just say cringe.
[130:11.17]Which one of us is posting the cringe?
[130:14.13]Sure it's me?
[130:24.78]oof oof no it's me it's me uh thanks for the 25 fucking dollars and bits though dude seriously it's lucan thanks for the five dollars Jerma are you in a quarantine no I am not I'm not let's hope it doesn't get that far but I'm not
[130:49.52]Future Fashioned Grow Clown.
[130:51.88]Thanks for the $3.20.
[130:52.96]Jeremy, what's your opinion on mustard on hard-boiled eggs?
[130:57.22]Well, a lot of deviled eggs have mustard inside of the mixture.
[131:00.94]So, I think that's alright.
[131:05.39]That's fine.
[131:05.75]That's good.
[131:06.37]It could be good.
[131:09.43]I don't know about directly on a hard-boiled egg, but part of the mixture of a deviled egg, sure.
[131:15.71]I'd say so.
[131:18.96]Espada Escalada, thanks for the 250.
[131:20.68]Mr. Bean is the Bugleberry of the television comedy world.
[131:23.82]No way.
[131:26.20]No.
[131:28.10]I don't agree with that.
[131:32.62]Apollyon Abaddon, thanks for the 500 bits.
[131:35.86]Can we talk for a second about how Bugleberry is the best character?
[131:40.25]I hope you think that.
[131:41.63]I really do.
[131:44.33]I really do.
[131:46.20]And if you have been part of any of the pre-stream chats over the last few days, you will know why.
[131:52.33]I really hope you do like him a lot.
[131:59.35]I hope so.
[132:14.83]Okay, here.
[132:17.61]Goiki, thanks for the 500 bits.
[132:19.05]Hope your pain goes away soon, Jerma.
[132:20.70]Also, fuck the bean team.
[132:23.10]What's wrong with you?
[132:24.04]How could you say something like that?
[132:25.04]He's a classic comedian.
[132:29.38]I do too.
[132:30.49]It's getting to the point where this is actually starting to...
[132:36.88]I went back to the doctor, and I had more tests done, and I have, like, my fucking rheumatoid factor is high, and I'm trying some new stuff, and this costochondritis might be... It might not just be costochondritis, I might have, like, rheumatoid fucking arthritis or something.
[132:54.79]It's still... We're just still on the fucking train, and I want to get off.
[132:58.87]You know, I want to, like, get off the damn train.
[133:02.15]So, it's just almost, it's like, it's been like almost two fucking years of this shit.
[133:08.96]I just want to know what the hell is wrong with me and just start treating the fucking thing.
[133:16.52]I'm just being totally honest with you, you know, I'm not gonna pretend or anything.
[133:21.21]Like, this is just me talking to you real.
[133:23.09]Like, this is just me.
[133:28.39]But, just whatever, I'm going to keep going until it's figured out and then just trade it and try to get back to normal.
[133:40.86]Stop pretending.
[133:42.96]Stop pretending.
[133:47.25]Unfortunately, funny streamer memes do not work in the world of potential medical issues.
[133:56.23]that's like going to the doctor and he's just like oh so what are your symptoms yeah I still have like this kind of like spinal like chest like core pain stop pretending monkey ass okay oh there he is jerva talks about the doctor and the doctor has a funny voice put the turkey on your head
[134:23.70]Here's the Gerber goes to the doctor and the doctor goes, oh, what's wrong with you?
[134:27.60]Oh, I'm stupid.
[134:29.94]There's a laugh track with the turkey.
[134:32.03]Oh, it just bumped into the wall.
[134:38.25]Anyways.
[134:38.59]Yeah, I just want to get it taken care of.
[134:44.93]And the problem is, like, the medical, the medical, like, world just moves so slowly.
[134:50.43]It's like, okay, so here, we're gonna do this, uh, intestine.
[134:54.57]Alright.
[134:55.51]See you in, like, two or three weeks.
[134:58.20]Like, can we just, can I just come in fucking tomorrow?
[135:01.50]Like, can I just come in for the next eight straight days and you just do everything you've ever wanted to do to me?
[135:07.86]Like, everything that you could even imagine, just do it all.
[135:10.66]Like, oh, we'll see, we'll catch back up with you.
[135:14.14]Uh, in April.
[135:16.12]Like, no, no, no.
[135:17.28]Can I... Can I... Can you just, like, do all this shit now?
[135:26.39]Like, well, we're gonna give you... We're gonna do an MRI.
[135:28.39]Let's set the MRI up.
[135:29.51]This is the thing you're trying to get figured out.
[135:31.49]Oh, we want to figure this out.
[135:33.04]Uh, so when are you available in four and a half weeks?
[135:35.42]Uh, I guess on Tuesday the fucking... The 12th.
[135:45.89]I just wanna bang bang, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's get it done!
[135:52.53]So like, it's a lot of hurry up and wait.
[135:55.07]And here's the thing, I also, I kinda get it too though, because... There's a lot of like, processing, and a lot of trying to f- I've had a bunch of shit done already, and we're just bouncing around with these different ideas of what could be fucking wrong with me, I did like a rheumatoid test and it's high, and it's like, okay, well what the fuck does that mean?
[136:17.86]Fringe Healthcare.
[136:19.48]Ale Country.
[136:21.10]Alright, JBumbum7723.
[136:22.40]I remember you.
[136:38.46]But I don't want to have, and this is the problem that I don't want to have bleed into the live streams.
[136:44.07]I don't want to have this be a problem for me to bring into the streams.
[136:49.31]I don't want it to affect the streams.
[136:50.90]I don't want to have it be a situation where I'm just, this is something I'm complaining about a lot, or every stream I'm like, this is fucking stupid, fuck this.
[137:00.88]So I don't want it to be like that.
[137:05.05]And although this is an annoying problem, it's not... It's not, like, debilitating to me.
[137:11.01]It's just there, and it's annoying, and I'll figure it out.
[137:14.00]But I don't want it to create this, like, aura of just negativity around me on the stream.
[137:20.40]Because I want to have fun.
[137:21.18]And, like, look.
[137:22.00]98 times out of 100, this is not a problem on stream.
[137:26.51]But sometimes it comes up, and it's just like, okay, what do I do now?
[137:30.15]Like, what should I do now?
[137:33.45]Unfortunately.
[137:41.89]And I know that it's like, no, don't, like, a lot of you guys are saying, like, don't worry about it.
[137:45.06]It's fine.
[137:45.38]Like, we get it and everything.
[137:46.48]And I really appreciate that.
[137:48.06]But remember, I want to be here.
[137:50.46]Like, I want to do this.
[137:52.34]I want to be live.
[137:53.65]I want to hang out.
[137:54.27]I want to, like, laugh and have a fucking good time.
[137:55.99]You know what I mean?
[137:56.53]Like, I don't want to be like, it's been three hours.
[137:58.21]I'm like, my back hurts.
[137:59.39]Bye.
[138:02.67]So it's, you know, it's frustrating.
[138:04.04]I'll be honest with you.
[138:06.14]It is.
[138:13.53]But I don't want it to be a thing that's... Because it's not really that... In the grand scheme of things, it's not that big of a deal.
[138:21.38]Because eventually, long term, I'll probably have a solution for it.
[138:24.86]It's just kind of short term is annoying.
[138:26.72]So... There you go.
[138:33.53]I'm laying it out there, right?
[138:35.85]What a megalo-fucking-maniac.
[138:44.23]So we're going to keep walking down the road until I actually get the exact thing that's really wrong.
[138:55.38]And that's pretty much it.
[138:56.62]I'm probably not going to address it too much more on stream.
[139:00.77]Because I also don't want it to turn into a thing where it's like, oh, Jerma, something's wrong with you.
[139:04.27]Something's wrong with Jerma.
[139:05.37]Something's wrong with him.
[139:06.69]Oh, man, it's alright, Jerma.
[139:07.57]There's something wrong with you.
[139:09.45]You're okay.
[139:09.95]Well, don't worry.
[139:11.63]I don't want it to turn into like a there's something wrong with Jerma.
[139:16.25]And, oh, no.
[139:17.75]You know what I mean?
[139:19.07]I don't want it to be like that.
[139:22.71]Something's always been wrong with you.
[139:24.79]Yeah, but I'm talking about in a medical sense.
[139:35.84]There's always something wrong with you, dude.
[139:41.12]But, anyways.
[139:43.79]That's pretty much it.
[139:44.73]Just want to talk to you guys.
[139:48.33]And be realistic and real with you.
[139:51.61]Sometimes.
[139:55.34]It's all fun and games until somebody wears a fucking boomer brace.
[139:57.98]You know what I'm saying?
[139:59.78]Hey Mitchell, thanks for the 500 bits.
[140:01.52]Odama more like awesome streamer providing years of priceless content.
[140:12.99]The clean your room title is just so fucking wrong.
[140:15.71]God damn it.
[140:19.39]Clean your room playing Elevates and Mr. Bean is the thumbnail eating raw turkey.
[140:25.21]Jesus, what now?
[140:30.32]It's all fun and games until somebody puts on a turkey head video.
[140:38.32]Mr. Bean headcrab edit.
[140:40.32]Oh, come on.
[140:41.58]I gotta watch this.
[141:01.94]You see, the problem with the mayor is that... Well, how can I put this kindly?
[141:06.84]He's a total idiot.
[141:08.88]What this city needs is leadership, vision, vision.
[141:16.82]I don't think you're going to get that from a compromise.
[141:25.80]That's quick.
[141:26.58]That's real.
[141:27.98]You gotta remember.
[141:30.28]Keep in mind.
[141:32.36]You gotta render this shit.
[141:34.40]It takes a little bit to render.
[141:36.72]You have to make this, render it, and upload it.
[141:43.95]Damn.
[141:44.73]That's fucking pretty good.
[141:45.75]Alright, let's keep going with the bits.
[141:52.31]We have a little bit more.
[141:56.72]We have... Oh, I lost it.
[142:00.20]Where'd it go?
[142:03.90]Where'd it go?
[142:04.58]There it is.
[142:07.08]That was Mitchell.
[142:09.16]Thank you for the $5, Mitchell, and the video.
[142:13.01]Hey, Lilden Osor, thanks for the 500 bits.
[142:16.03]Hey, Germo, today's my fourth anniversary with my boyfriend, and we celebrated by watching you.
[142:20.77]Love and appreciate you.
[142:21.43]Hope all your health stuff gets better soon.
[142:22.92]Well, I appreciate that.
[142:23.64]Thank you.
[142:25.00]And happy anniversary.
[142:27.08]Four years.
[142:28.20]That's really good.
[142:33.32]Thanks for the five ducks.
[142:35.50]Five bucks.
[142:39.28]And I can hear myself talking because this thing is plugged in and it's speech jamming me.
[142:47.24]So let me just turn that off.
[142:49.40]Here we go.
[142:49.78]That's better.
[142:53.15]Okay.
[142:54.11]Yeah, I can hear myself talking in my own ears.
[142:58.37]Do a speech jammer stream.
[143:01.82]That wouldn't last very long.
[143:02.76]I'd throw up.
[143:07.54]I could try it.
[143:10.56]I could try it for fun.
[143:11.88]For like maybe half an hour or something at the end of a stream.
[143:16.66]But yeah, happy anniversary.
[143:17.56]Thanks for the $5.
[143:19.33]No, it was just, it was kind of the catalyst to my pain.
[143:20.85]It was the way I had to hold the Wii mode and move it around and just the, I don't know, something about it.
[143:23.71]By the way, the director that made Beautiful Joe also made God Hand.
[143:47.88]I knew you were going to talk about God Hand at some point.
[143:52.04]Put it on the list.
[143:53.06]Jeremy, put it on the list, Elbertson.
[143:59.95]Jeremy, push every new stream week a day and put it on the list, Elbertson.
[144:05.57]985.
[144:13.84]Play Boom Blocks.
[144:15.20]I have it.
[144:16.04]It is there.
[144:16.52]It's behind me.
[144:18.59]I will play God Hand.
[144:20.23]I will play God Hand.
[144:22.26]I will.
[144:23.58]Just not today.
[144:25.38]Not today.
[144:26.46]Not tomorrow.
[144:30.24]Also, my girlfriend recently woke me up in the middle of the night and told me not only is she a germaphobe, but also that a germaphobe, she is still jealous.
[144:40.83]Ah, take care of your old man body.
[144:42.99]Wait, let me read this again.
[144:45.17]Toby, not only is she a germaphobe, but also a germaphobe, she's still jealous.
[144:51.35]And then a ton of laughing.
[144:52.69]She's jealous of you.
[144:53.63]She's scared of you.
[144:57.45]She's scared of you.
[145:00.13]Did I finish Super Mario Sunshine?
[145:01.59]I did.
[145:02.05]I did.
[145:03.63]I got, I beat the game, and I got, what, 71, 72 stars or something?
[145:13.69]SticksRenegade, thanks for the 250.
[145:14.77]I hope this virus doesn't get to me.
[145:17.35]If you remember, I take immunosuppressants for Crohn's.
[145:19.45]There's one case in my city and 20 cases in Rhode Island.
[145:22.59]Yeah, that's... Just be careful.
[145:26.69]Just be careful.
[145:37.56]Stay safe, yeah.
[145:44.02]Just try to be healthy.
[145:45.30]Try to be aware.
[145:45.98]That's all you can do.
[145:52.17]DarkSoul, thanks for the $2.50.
[145:53.49]Here's DrinkBits.
[145:54.69]Johnny Blue tastes like cigars and assholes.
[145:57.53]Shoutout to my boy, Near.
[145:59.51]Call of Fury Warzone good.
[146:02.69]Me drunk.
[146:03.47]Thank you, cutie.
[146:06.49]Um... I'm sorry that... I'm sorry that you... have an opinion...
[146:14.93]That is not correct.
[146:19.03]I'm sorry that you feel wrongly about something.
[146:36.04]This tastes like cigars and asshole.
[146:38.46]Okay, do you like whiskey?
[146:39.37]Do you like whiskey?
[146:44.84]Because if you don't like whiskey, then don't take my recommendations for whiskey.
[146:49.42]Right?
[146:51.70]That's like, dude, I hate hot sauce.
[146:54.53]I hate it.
[146:54.99]I think it's disgusting.
[146:56.49]Yeah, you should try Tabasco sauce.
[146:58.35]Oh, should I?
[146:58.83]Let me try that.
[146:59.41]I hate hot sauce.
[147:00.25]Let me try it.
[147:00.83]Ugh, this tastes like fucking assholes.
[147:03.49]He likes whiskey.
[147:04.90]He likes good whiskey.
[147:05.82]Okay.
[147:08.85]Johnny Walker Blue is good.
[147:11.81]It's very, very smooth.
[147:12.87]It's light.
[147:14.83]It's whatever.
[147:18.79]Whatever.
[147:19.09]Maybe you should try poo wine.
[147:22.35]Oh, fuck.
[147:24.55]Don't do that.
[147:26.49]Don't do that.
[147:27.27]Don't do this to me.
[147:28.21]That was the fucking craziest thing, man.
[147:33.26]This is a weird stream.
[147:35.86]What a fucked up stream.
[147:39.11]The poo wine thing was so ridiculous and it fucked me up for life.
[147:44.49]I didn't think I was ever going to do a stream that was going to fuck me up for life.
[147:48.65]And here I am completely corrected.
[147:50.92]And it was ridiculous.
[147:59.00]It was exactly the way that it would look.
[148:01.06]It was that person that said that originally.
[148:04.48]Holy shit, you have messed me up permanently.
[148:13.17]Hey, Machine Nation, thanks for the three dollars.
[148:15.92]Hey, Jerm, I just wanted to point out something.
[148:17.90]When you played Asura's Wrath, you mentioned it was highly recommended, and I found it was mentioned nine times in the recommendation channel.
[148:25.54]Today you played Monster Lab, which you also mentioned you got from the recommendations, and that was only mentioned once.
[148:31.58]Meanwhile, the game Fury has been recommended 12 times since December 2018.
[148:35.66]It's not been played at all.
[148:36.98]Well, that's not accurate.
[148:38.75]Just want to put that out there.
[148:39.63]Well, you've got to get your facts right.
[148:41.37]I streamed Fury already.
[148:43.37]The whole stream.
[148:45.05]Your facts are incorrect.
[148:47.13]Make sure you come in here with real facts.
[148:49.59]Because I streamed the video game Fury already when it came out.
[148:58.79]I got like 60, 50, 60% of the way through the game.
[149:08.05]So, I mean, if you're going to come after the king, what's that line?
[149:15.75]If you're going to come after the king, make sure you bring sweets and give them to me.
[149:28.27]Yeah, that's it.
[149:29.06]That's the line.
[149:31.80]By the way, I just want to make this really clear.
[149:34.84]Just because somebody writes something in the recommended channel, even if it's a hundred times, doesn't mean I will ever play it.
[149:43.40]The reason why I played Monster Lab is because it was recommended and I looked at it and I said, hey, this looks like it could be interesting.
[149:49.97]Everyone's a big fan of Monster Rancher.
[149:52.57]It's like a back and forth.
[149:54.13]You have a monster that you grow and level up and
[149:58.36]Turns out, when it was actually played, it wasn't really that, like, I wasn't into it.
[150:12.67]And it had tracing in it, so I wasn't going to play it.
[150:21.37]Play purple place.
[150:23.61]But the recommended channel is not about how many people recommend something.
[150:26.99]It's about, do I think it's interesting enough for me to want to stream it?
[150:31.10]Like, do I want to play it?
[150:32.26]I mean, that's a recommendation.
[150:37.24]It's not a demand.
[150:39.90]Right?
[150:45.38]But to answer your question, I've already streamed Fury.
[150:49.77]I did.
[150:52.25]Come on.
[150:53.36]Come on.
[150:54.38]Come on.
[150:58.96]When?
[150:59.54]When the game came out.
[151:01.24]I'm going to look this up.
[151:02.06]I'm going to stop at Jerm of Fury.
[151:05.13]Is it archived?
[151:05.69]I think it might be.
[151:10.49]Maybe it's one of those streams that never got archived.
[151:15.99]No, it does not.
[151:18.77]There's not even a single clip of me playing this game, huh?
[151:33.25]I love Fury.
[151:34.69]I had no idea he streamed it.
[151:35.93]If you Google Jerma Fury, this is the second result.
[151:39.31]And it is the Reddit thread asking if I've ever streamed Fury.
[151:43.70]There's no evidence that it was ever streamed.
[151:47.48]That's so funny.
[151:48.92]No, I did.
[151:49.66]I did.
[151:51.44]I swear to God.
[151:54.18]People were here.
[151:54.98]I didn't imagine this.
[151:57.92]I swear.
[152:00.44]You can't prove that you did.
[152:04.55]Yes, I did.
[152:05.27]It's a lost episode.
[152:18.68]Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
[152:19.46]What's this?
[152:19.86]Wait, wait, wait.
[152:20.84]We got a clip.
[152:21.32]Somebody has a clip.
[152:22.12]Oh, shit.
[152:29.82]Whoops.
[152:31.89]Get that back in there.
[152:34.03]This is me playing Fury, but it's me changing games?
[152:38.49]Get in there.
[152:41.53]What the fuck is this thing?
[152:42.99]Come on.
[152:51.20]There we go.
[152:51.90]There we go.
[152:54.52]I was trying to stay with you.
[152:55.44]I told you.
[152:56.26]Stay with her.
[153:02.01]You have brought this upon yourself, stranger.
[153:07.12]It's real.
[153:07.82]I told you it was real.
[153:09.02]Tactical visor activated.
[153:11.94]What the fuck am I doing?
[153:13.06]Oh, shit.
[153:15.30]Tactical visor activated.
[153:16.66]Oh, it's Mercy and Soldier: 76 combined.
[153:21.51]Whoa, new hero announced.
[153:24.31]Alright.
[153:25.69]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[153:26.45]Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.
[153:27.61]Nobody, don't you dare -2 that.
[153:29.83]That was an incredibly relevant fucking joke because Overwatch was in beta and it was like the biggest fucking thing in the world.
[153:37.39]Okay.
[153:38.77]Sorry.
[153:39.67]Four years ago, I made a jokey reference to like one of the biggest video game releases in 10 years.
[153:45.44]It was four years ago.
[153:48.62]I didn't just say that last weekend.
[153:58.65]We used to stream Overwatch.
[154:01.33]And then I just didn't think it was fun anymore.
[154:07.55]Dude, cringe ages like fine wine.
[154:10.77]Get out of here.
[154:12.31]Get out of here.
[154:13.63]Get out of here.
[154:15.09]Get out of here.
[154:19.62]Alright, I'll see you guys.
[154:20.48]We're going to do the credits.
[154:23.22]Sorry for the four hour stream.
[154:25.26]Thankfully it wasn't like a two hour stream.
[154:27.12]Because it really could have been.
[154:29.52]Could have been.
[154:32.60]Thanks for watching regardless.
[154:35.38]We'll see you tomorrow.
[154:36.68]I'm going to do the microphone video game and see if we can get three times, third time's a charm.
[154:45.39]It's either third time's a charm or strike three, you're out.
[154:47.93]Because each microphone video game we've played has been some of my favorite times on stream.
[154:55.23]Like, I've had a lot of fun with the microphone games.
[154:57.62]This could be strike three, you're out, or it could be third time's a charm.
[155:02.86]Find out.
[155:06.46]But I'll see you tomorrow.
[155:07.72]Here come the credits.
[155:08.30]We'll do the last couple of bits.
[155:10.84]As always, thanks for your subs.
[155:14.29]This channel sees a lot of money, like I say frequently.
[155:19.25]Thank you, everybody.
[155:26.76]Really appreciate it.
[155:30.22]We will finish the bits.
[155:32.56]There's only a couple left.
[155:39.02]Hey, thanks AwFuts for the 500 bits.
[155:42.93]The music is off.
[155:52.06]Offutt says hi Jerma.
[155:52.92]I hope you're having a good day.
[155:53.74]Please read the following before you read it out loud.
[156:04.92]Oh, okay.
[156:05.16]Hold on.
[156:06.40]Uh, temperature does influence joint pain.
[156:09.26]It's the barometric pressure.
[156:10.66]I have rheumatoid arthritis, and any major change in temperature really messes me up.
[156:15.36]Cold, rainy, humid weather makes my joints, tendons, muscles tight, while hot weather ups pain.
[156:21.93]That's just me, and I'm obviously not your doctor, but I hope this information helps you find some answers.
[156:27.61]Because Vegas is really, really dry, and, I mean, obviously it's been cold recently because it's been the wintertime, but...
[156:36.50]Hot weather ups pain.
[156:39.25]I don't know.
[156:41.49]Let me... This is very, very good information, and I will take it, absolutely.
[156:45.38]But let me get that, like, a confirmation that that's what's really going on.
[156:50.81]Because that's another thing, too, with obviously me talking about some of this stuff on stream.
[156:55.97]I don't want to come here with inaccurate information and stuff that might not be true.
[157:00.52]Like, oh, guys, I have rheumatoid arthritis.
[157:02.64]Like, I don't.
[157:03.80]Like, I don't.
[157:04.42]That's not confirmed.
[157:05.94]I have this.
[157:06.42]I don't want to have you guys.
[157:07.54]I don't want to talk about something that I have when I might not even have it.
[157:13.46]You know, I want to be certain and not just, like, throw out nonsense that could be not even true.
[157:23.89]As much as I talk about it, I don't really want to give you diagnostic stuff.
[157:30.18]Because I've done that in the past before and I don't- I just don't really want to do that anymore.
[157:36.18]I'd like to just keep it just private until I have a certain answer.
[157:39.18]But on the other side of that coin - it's like hard to not because if I'm having like a problem and I have to like stop a stream or something it's like why are you stopping the stream?
[157:45.18]It's like I have this problem and then I have to talk about it and you know what I'm saying?
[157:52.18]It's like a- just trying to balance it out a little bit.
[158:01.28]But, that's pretty much it.
[158:06.52]Just say, health problems.
[158:07.76]Yeah.
[158:10.28]And, like, when I wear, that's, like, when I wear, like, the brace, it's, like, I know a lot of people are fucking around, and I think it's funny.
[158:16.35]I do think it's funny.
[158:17.77]So, you're not, like, hurting my feelings when it's, like, he's got overalls on.
[158:20.91]Like, why does he have a backpack on?
[158:22.21]Like, that's humorous.
[158:23.67]It's funny to me.
[158:24.35]It is.
[158:26.20]But there are people that actually come in, and they're, like, why is he wearing that?
[158:29.14]Like, is he, what's it for?
[158:31.81]It's like, well, it's his backpack, right?
[158:35.01]That's it.
[158:35.31]So, you know, I'm trying to find a healthy balance as to what it even is.
[158:47.89]But...
[158:50.22]Goobery Juice, thanks for the $2.50.
[158:52.14]Hey, cool, I love Monster Lab.
[158:53.62]So glad you're playing the... Oops, never mind.
[158:55.96]Hey, how was Rabbids?
[158:58.20]I love that game.
[158:58.84]It's so... Oh, whoops.
[159:00.30]Scammed.
[159:00.82]Hey, well, Cabela 2005 was the first game I ever played.
[159:04.57]Oh, he hates it.
[159:06.25]Whoa, okay, I love Elebits.
[159:07.63]That might be fun.
[159:08.65]Oh, he's just watching Mr. Bean now.
[159:12.15]Ha ha ha ha ha!
[159:13.07]Ha ha ha ha ha!
[159:18.62]It's so true, it hurts.
[159:23.67]It's perfect.
[159:24.37]What a perfect way to end this stream.
[159:26.21]That's perfect.
[159:29.47]Oh, I love that guy.
[159:30.39]Woof, scammed.
[159:36.50]Goddamn.
[159:39.04]It's all good, though.
[159:40.00]Whatever.
[159:40.98]It's all good.
[159:42.08]Hey, Bimmy.
[159:43.62]Thanks, Bimmy, for the $3, Bimmy.
[159:47.16]And finally, we had free dolls from Ozals, which will take us to the end of the stream.
[159:53.59]Thank you, Ozals, for the three bucks.
[159:57.12]It's a relevant video.
[159:58.16]There's a relevant video here.
[160:02.26]Prove it.
[160:04.11]Take a poop in front of us.
[160:06.89]And then turn it into wine.
[160:08.29]Turn that poop into wine.
[160:10.51]Turn that poop into wine.
[160:12.71]Turn that poop into wine.
[160:14.73]Turn that poop into wine.
[160:16.69]Turn that poop into wine.
[160:21.54]On the second coming of Jesus Christ, prove it.
[160:24.84]Take a poop in front of us.
[160:26.66]Prove it.
[160:27.30]Take a poop in front of us.
[160:31.00]supposed to mean oh that's Eric andre's is fucking hilarious you should watch more Eric andre well I can't watch more Eric andre because I've seen all Eric andre I've seen it all all of his show all of his extended New Year's Eve celebrations I've seen them all
[161:01.30]He's very, very, very funny.
[161:08.11]Are you going to see the movie?
[161:10.61]I hope so.
[161:12.05]I hope so.
[161:12.63]I better.
[161:19.52]Raid.
[161:19.86]Raid.
[161:20.24]Raid Joel.
[161:21.04]Raid Joel.
[161:21.56]Raid.
[161:22.62]Raid Joel.
[161:24.78]What's Joel doing right now?
[161:32.07]What's he up to?
[161:34.37]Grand Theft Auto 3?
[161:38.38]What the heck?
[161:39.52]Grand Theft Auto 3.
[161:44.18]Somebody did an uptime in this stream and I thought it said 20 hours.
[161:49.43]Like, holy shit.
[161:51.14]It's been going for a long fucking time.
[161:52.82]Is it weird that I, this is an ad, but I wasn't looking and I thought that was Joel doing like a voice for a second.
[161:59.84]I was like, wait, this is a, no, it's a Carl's Jr.
[162:02.08]ad.
[162:19.22]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[162:22.12]Have a good night.
[162:22.70]Again, sorry for the ending of the stream, but, you know, you gotta do what you gotta do.
[162:31.03]See you guys tomorrow.
[162:33.09]We'll do it again tomorrow.
[162:34.88]Good night.
[162:35.50]Take care.
[162:37.52]Have a good one.
[162:56.65]Thank you.
