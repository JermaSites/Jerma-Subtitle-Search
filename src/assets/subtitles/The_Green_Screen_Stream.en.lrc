[00:09.94]I wonder how bad this microphone is.
[00:14.49]Am I coming out like one side of your ear?
[00:22.87]It sounds great?
[00:23.65]Well, it's about to sound probably way worse.
[00:29.37]You got atmosphere.
[00:32.89]That's what you got with me.
[00:37.06]And I was going to do like this.
[00:39.57]Camera's not working?
[00:41.41]There is no camera.
[00:44.09]I'm in my living room right now.
[00:47.59]Like, oh, green screen screen.
[00:52.06]I painted my living room wall green.
[00:55.80]I hope it looks alright.
[01:06.18]Yeah, it's like, I painted it like,
[01:08.84]It's like a green slash blue.
[01:11.20]It might not work, so.
[01:14.37]Oh, by the way.
[01:17.92]How we doing?
[01:41.66]That's a lot of space.
[01:42.66]I haven't even done anything yet.
[01:47.90]We just started.
[01:50.70]I got a big living room, guys.
[01:52.26]You understand?
[01:57.28]I got props over here.
[01:58.88]There's a lot of shit I have here.
[02:00.16]I'm going to take this slow because I need to make sure that I... I took a long time trying to get this correct.
[02:06.96]I might need a little more light this way.
[02:08.42]You know what I'm saying?
[02:11.24]Maybe a little bit like right here.
[02:25.13]Let me see.
[02:31.82]Is anybody else here with me?
[02:32.98]No.
[02:38.52]Let me do this.
[02:41.33]Take the mic with me.
[02:44.18]I can't take the mic with me.
[02:45.48]That's not going to work.
[02:46.10]Alright, let me make sure that this is correct.
[02:59.87]Yeah.
[03:00.01]Alright, let me just turn this up a little so we can be able to see.
[03:09.99]What if I do this?
[03:20.04]That makes it a little better, right?
[03:23.55]That actually looks alright.
[03:26.75]And we're in 60 FPS!
[03:29.63]It's 60 FPS, right?
[03:35.93]That's what this thing is.
[03:40.08]Right?
[03:40.36]Can you see?
[03:41.52]You can see all the frames, right?
[03:54.40]That's the, yeah, 720p.
[03:57.36]Yeah, to get to do 60, I have to do 720.
[04:01.93]So this is 720p 60 from motion.
[04:05.23]I can do 1080p 30, but I don't think it'll look as good.
[04:09.81]Because I was doing it and I was moving around and it was like, you couldn't even, it was hard to tell what I was even doing.
[04:24.64]Try 1080?
[04:25.42]Hold on.
[04:27.32]You guys tell me, okay?
[04:28.78]You tell me if 1080 looks better.
[04:32.49]Because I tried them both.
[04:40.81]So this is 1080 30.
[04:41.25]Let me move that.
[04:55.70]I'll do some karate chops.
[04:57.70]Don't worry.
[05:00.06]So this is 1080.
[05:01.56]This is 1080 30.
[05:02.34]So you see what I'm saying?
[05:07.98]It's like... Bring it back.
[05:20.19]Wait, wait, wait.
[05:20.89]Hold on a second.
[05:21.47]Hold on.
[05:23.91]Hold on a second.
[05:28.08]This is 1080 30.
[05:29.08]What would you rather have?
[05:33.11]Higher quality image or faster karate chops?
[05:36.35]Do you see what I'm saying?
[05:54.63]60 FPS versus disgusting 30 FPS.
[06:01.46]Well, we can do both.
[06:07.09]We can do both.
[06:09.45]Let me just make sure we got it.
[06:13.31]Hold on.
[06:14.11]Let me get this.
[06:21.64]One second.
[06:26.82]Hold on.
[06:33.11]1080?
[06:35.45]I'll give you a 1080 roundhouse kick and you see the differences, okay?
[06:43.96]You think I can do roundhouse kicks?
[06:46.20]Oh wow, I didn't know Jerma could do roundhouse kicks, huh?
[06:58.69]Alright, now let's take a look at that in 60.
[07:05.78]you tell me which one you want more here we go 60 FPS
[07:44.76]Okay, there we go.
[07:45.14]Alright, here's 60.
[07:47.94]Ready?
[07:50.07]I'll give you a roundhouse kick at 60.
[08:02.09]60 or 1080?
[08:02.90]You want better quality or you want... Wait, it's blurry.
[08:12.34]Maybe I... Hold on a second here.
[08:18.39]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[08:21.77]Oh, hold on a second, guys.
[08:29.55]Oh, whoops.
[08:31.48]Okay.
[08:34.98]60 FPS is nice, but doesn't look good.
[08:47.50]Alright, we'll do 1080 for a while.
[08:53.48]Is 1080... Can I, like, force it to 60?
[08:56.57]I don't think I can.
[08:58.67]But I don't think I could even... 1080 60 would be bad.
[09:01.93]I just... I can't stream from here on 1080 60.
[09:04.62]It just wouldn't work.
[09:05.86]Okay.
[09:08.76]Okay.
[09:18.79]Hold on a second.
[09:19.71]Everybody stay where you are, okay?
[09:24.11]I'm going to... I don't think I can stream at like 6,000 or 7,000 from here.
[09:30.60]I'm at 5,000 up.
[09:33.80]I might be able to get away with 6,000 or 7,000.
[09:36.38]I don't know.
[09:36.80]Maybe not.
[09:38.46]That's going to be tricky.
[09:47.51]I think this is good.
[09:48.97]There is glare up here, though, over there.
[09:52.11]There's glare right here.
[09:52.89]Alright.
[09:57.65]I wonder what happens if I kill this one.
[10:10.48]Is that better?
[10:10.98]Maybe this one needs to be dropped a little.
[10:16.86]It's a process.
[10:23.82]How's that?
[10:24.32]Better?
[10:28.84]I just like walking by.
[10:36.63]But the bat, I need to turn this one back on.
[10:42.74]Okay.
[10:49.30]How about this one?
[10:49.94]How's this one looking?
[10:56.74]This one is good.
[11:03.99]This one is also alright.
[11:16.98]Okay.
[11:19.36]Change shirt?
[11:20.14]I got plenty of shirts.
[11:28.54]Alright, I'm ready.
[11:31.80]So I have, here take a look, you wanna see?
[11:34.01]You wanna see what we're working with today?
[11:36.47]I have about 100 actions.
[11:42.69]Oops.
[11:46.60]So I think this is as good as we're gonna get it.
[11:50.02]Maybe a little bit, no that's alright.
[11:52.84]I can't get rid of that though.
[11:55.84]It's like that right there.
[12:02.62]It's a big living room?
[12:13.32]Yeah, I got a 6,900 square foot house.
[12:25.45]Alright.
[12:27.85]I really wish I could get rid of that.
[12:30.90]I don't think I can get rid of that.
[12:34.95]I don't think that'll be a problem keying it, though.
[12:39.99]Let me try one more thing.
[12:43.03]One more thing.
[12:54.20]That makes that brighter.
[12:55.50]I'm going to keep it like this, but give me one second where I find where these are.
[13:00.41]I don't know where they are.
[13:01.16]Shit.
[13:11.50]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[13:15.21]Okay, here we go.
[13:20.39]Almost.
[13:20.77]There's a little bit of glare on the sides here.
[13:31.50]Am I making, I'm casting shadows though.
[13:37.02]It's perfect.
[13:39.58]Okay.
[13:42.22]Shadow.
[13:52.09]Alright, so how we're gonna start this is, alright, I might as well just start.
[13:59.29]Video editors can easily handle this
[14:02.09]Well, then I'm getting rid of the shadow.
[14:14.92]Oh, you get.
[14:18.70]He want the go back.
[14:20.96]Oh, God.
[14:21.70]Alright.
[14:22.14]Alright.
[14:22.44]Fine.
[14:28.58]OK.
[14:31.19]You good?
[14:31.73]We call it this?
[14:37.21]Go back.
[14:38.15]Alright, here we go.
[14:44.34]So the first thing that I want to do, let me show you what we've seen here.
[14:49.84]So I got a lot of space here, right, as you can see.
[14:54.48]I'm going to do standing, walking, running,
[14:59.36]I'm going to do it all in the same... How's that?
[15:23.39]Give us a tour.
[15:24.33]Alright, I think we're good.
[15:29.90]So, here's what you're gonna get.
[15:32.92]Ready?
[15:36.67]Begin!
[17:18.91]You need to watch.
[17:22.89]Okay, there he is.
[17:23.39]That's standing.
[17:25.13]Okay?
[17:29.57]You got a couple angles, a couple of close-ups, right?
[17:31.75]We're going to move on.
[17:37.97]You need more?
[17:38.69]Okay, I'll give you another one.
[17:41.79]Here.
[17:41.95]We're just getting through the general motions, you know what I'm saying?
[17:45.88]So here's another standing, just kind of doing whatever.
[17:58.29]I mean, like, good day.
[18:15.80]You're my guy right there.
[18:17.66]You're my guy right there.
[18:18.66]Where is he?
[18:21.05]Where's my guy?
[18:22.37]There he is right there.
[18:23.19]That's my guy.
[18:23.81]Alright.
[18:28.04]Now we're gonna do louder.
[18:33.88]I know, guys, you have to understand, there are like a hundred of these.
[18:37.34]I'm just getting the good ones.
[18:39.07]They're not the good ones, I'm just getting like the easy ones.
[18:43.35]Can you mic up?
[18:44.39]I don't have like a lav mic.
[18:47.95]I'll be louder, don't worry.
[18:49.99]T-pose is on the list.
[18:51.25]Okay, here we go, you ready?
[18:52.97]This is walking now, walking.
[19:27.40]I'll get some more walks for you.
[19:28.86]I'll get you some walking in place.
[19:55.09]Okay.
[19:56.22]Get some more walks here.
[19:57.07]So a little bit hot, a little bit more faster.
[20:25.15]Now we need running
[20:58.51]It's like a brake.
[21:02.64]Faster?
[21:03.16]Alright, here we go.
[21:45.70]He's coming.
[21:54.41]Oh boy.
[21:56.89]Alright, what else we got?
[22:00.99]And that's it.
[22:01.81]See you tomorrow.
[22:05.94]Alright.
[22:09.62]I didn't bring anything.
[22:10.46]I brought coffee.
[22:11.94]That's not going to dry me up.
[22:16.02]I need to go drink my water from this toilet sink.
[22:24.47]I'm gonna go drink water out of the toilet.
[22:25.99]Alright, hold on, here we go.
[22:27.89]Next up is dashing, dodging, and crouching.
[23:07.72]Get a little closer.
[23:24.97]Back dash.
[23:27.90]Alright, crouching.
[24:11.82]Wait, autofocus turned on?
[24:14.42]Should've.
[24:21.32]Stepping off screen, yeah.
[24:24.85]I have to.
[24:27.41]Autofocus shouldn't be on.
[24:29.97]I just recalibrated it.
[24:32.03]Alright, here we go.
[24:35.68]Next!
[24:42.82]I'm gonna like tire myself out right now.
[24:46.10]The punch, being punched, kick, being kicked, being hit with objects.
[24:58.89]Fuck me.
[25:00.61]I gotta change my clothes soon here.
[25:01.98]Alright.
[25:11.77]let's do it
[25:44.55]I don't want to fight you.
[25:45.19]I don't want to.
[25:46.97]I don't want to fight you, man.
[25:47.89]I don't.
[25:50.90]I didn't want to knock you out, but I didn't.
[25:58.02]Here we go.
[26:03.20]Oh, you didn't think I was going to catch it.
[26:09.39]That's it.
[26:10.05]Broken bones.
[26:12.17]That's it.
[26:13.63]And the ground.
[26:21.84]My shoelace came untied.
[26:24.90]Ready?
[26:26.32]Kicks.
[26:43.19]Oh, I almost just ripped my pants.
[27:09.21]Ooh, don't!
[27:13.18]I'm supposed to be doing kicks.
[27:15.82]Alright, we'll do one of these.
[27:23.89]Try it again.
[27:46.12]Fuck you.
[27:50.45]I gotta get hit, I gotta get hit.
[27:56.66]Face, each arm, each leg.
[28:26.16]Why do I keep doing the puke?
[28:58.44]The shoe, my shoe's untied.
[29:00.64]God damn it.
[29:07.87]I have to puke every time I get hit.
[29:14.85]Alright, here we go.
[29:21.23]You.
[29:23.28]It's time for you to pay.
[29:26.70]You're going down.
[29:33.93]The bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[29:44.98]Was that... Alright, let me get a toilet water break.
[30:24.32]I ain't even getting to the fucking props yet, guys.
[30:26.64]There's a bag of props over here.
[30:29.16]There's a bag of props right there.
[30:34.34]Alright.
[30:35.56]So that settles that.
[30:37.17]Please do a fat roll.
[30:38.41]We'll get to that in a second.
[30:39.21]Hold on.
[30:43.39]Alright.
[30:43.75]So climbing.
[30:47.85]I'm going to climb.
[30:49.69]Climbing.
[31:49.64]That's not going to work.
[32:32.90]Oh, God.
[33:12.68]Okay.
[33:19.52]That doesn't even work.
[33:20.58]Alright, here we go, alright?
[33:24.53]Bring it up just a little.
[33:31.91]Because here is a flat surface right here, man.
[33:39.66]I'm doing this the wrong way.
[33:42.11]I have to do it this way.
[33:44.89]This, that, this, what is here?
[33:48.23]It's me.
[33:48.99]I'm in front of a screen.
[33:51.31]What the fuck am I doing?
[33:53.54]That's better.
[33:59.10]Why am I on this?
[33:59.94]Just go like this.
[34:05.32]Why am I doing like this, struggling to get over a cliff?
[34:09.13]I don't know why I'm like into that right now.
[34:14.86]That's you up there.
[34:16.06]Hey, can you throw me down a light raft or something?
[34:20.18]No light raft?
[34:21.32]Don't worry, I'll get it.
[34:22.30]My fucking pants just fell down.
[34:28.35]Hey, can you give me a hand down here?
[34:34.29]That's like a 400 foot jump.
[34:37.11]I guess I'll give it a try.
[34:38.49]No, no, don't worry about me.
[34:39.65]Two, three.
[34:41.91]Grr!
[35:01.75]Alright.
[35:09.59]Cam back down.
[35:10.25]Yeah, I'll get it.
[35:15.57]Alright.
[35:15.91]Now, now we're going to do facial reactions.
[35:29.74]Cam down.
[35:30.16]I will, I will.
[35:32.52]I gotta get these though.
[35:39.17]It's like right, right, it's good, right?
[36:04.71]Say it again.
[36:17.94]These are close-ups.
[36:18.94]These are the close-ups.
[36:21.38]So you can get bifacial reactions.
[36:23.12]Hold on, ready?
[36:56.26]How about this one, please?
[37:05.95]What?
[37:10.69]No, it's my birthday today.
[37:12.23]Thanks, everybody.
[37:13.57]No, wait, that's supposed to be a surprise birthday party.
[37:15.07]Hold on.
[37:20.25]I mean, why is it so dark in here?
[37:27.77]Honey?
[37:32.53]Honey?
[37:38.81]Happy birthday.
[37:47.99]The doorknob is up in his chest.
[38:07.92]You just went right in?
[38:08.50]Right around the chin.
[38:10.34]Right around the chin, right there.
[38:14.32]Ooh!
[38:19.96]Ear lawsuit inbound?
[38:21.22]I'm sorry.
[38:25.88]Throw some punches the other way.
[38:30.64]See, the thing about this brain screen, right?
[38:32.65]Getting too close, like here, I need to blow it out.
[38:37.66]It's designed for me to be, like, standing here.
[38:41.52]You know what I mean?
[38:43.06]But I did want to get a bunch of at least full body stuff.
[38:45.64]Maybe I'll blow it out and get some more.
[38:53.31]Do some more screaming?
[38:58.75]Too much headroom?
[39:01.17]I mean, but that's all I got for the green on the bottom, though.
[39:05.32]I mean, in editing program, right, you'll just take this side and this side and just get it from here, you know?
[39:13.42]But hopefully this is not going to be too much of a problem.
[39:15.10]I don't think it will be.
[39:17.42]But I'll do some more of this stuff with the back blown out so there is no shadow at all.
[39:27.31]But anyways, let's keep going.
[39:33.49]I hope you bought green clothes.
[39:38.54]Well, I guess here, hold on.
[39:40.87]I can do this.
[39:41.99]Let me test something here.
[39:45.85]Because I have a tester.
[39:48.83]Let's see how it works.
[39:56.77]OK, let me just get it on here.
[40:04.26]Because this will be able to give us a good indication of how this is going to play out.
[40:13.05]Let me loop it and you tell me.
[40:38.06]Okay, let's get a green key on here.
[40:43.49]And make sure I have it on there correctly.
[40:55.72]Green.
[41:01.08]Why is this not doing it?
[41:05.10]OK.
[41:06.58]Let's take a look.
[41:19.52]Ah, the beach.
[41:40.05]It's like, it's a little watery here.
[41:42.63]It's a little too watery.
[41:49.59]He's giant.
[41:54.11]Well, also keep in mind, this is like just, this is like the, I just have this through OBS.
[41:57.88]You know what I mean?
[42:01.98]So let me see if I do this.
[42:05.04]This is just like the default settings through OBS.
[42:06.64]You know what I'm saying?
[42:16.63]If I mess with the settings a little bit,
[42:23.02]Hold on.
[42:26.50]I'm transparent.
[42:38.70]Let me see.
[42:45.11]There we go.
[42:47.27]I mean, with playing around with the settings, whoever is going to be using it,
[42:53.67]I think it'll be alright.
[43:03.43]Yeah.
[43:13.08]OK.
[43:17.62]So I'm going to turn this off.
[43:24.86]Don't worry, I'm getting in a full suit in doing a weather report, guys.
[43:27.72]Don't worry.
[43:36.85]We've only been live for 40 minutes.
[43:38.95]I got like another hour and a half worth of stuff to do.
[43:43.38]I'm just doing the basics.
[43:49.40]Nine more hours.
[43:50.86]I don't know about that.
[43:52.24]Alright, so here you go.
[43:55.29]So now I've got to get chased, and then I have to chase someone.
[44:03.60]So that looks alright.
[44:10.66]So here's the chase sequence.
[44:11.76]So I'm going to be coming from this way to that way.
[44:15.73]So I have to chase, and then I have to chase somebody else.
[44:23.23]So.
[44:34.07]Get the fuck out of the way.
[44:35.13]Get out of the way, you fucking idiot.
[44:36.17]Hey, come here.
[44:36.97]Get back here.

[45:45.50]Oh Jesus!
[46:31.02]Toilet water.
[46:32.35]Be right back.
[47:18.51]Jesus, running in place is so much fucking harder than just running in general.
[47:29.70]Getting winded after light exercise.
[47:32.00]No, it's the running in place.
[47:33.28]Alright.
[47:38.42]Now I gotta walk backwards terrified of something.
[47:42.92]Don't worry, I'm gonna do death animations, don't worry.
[47:56.17]We need some up close stuff too, like chasing.
[47:59.11]Like, so you can get from like here, from like, you know, from here up.

[54:45.09]They scanned me.
[54:46.95]Right here.
[54:49.29]And they always have this fucking weird face too.
[55:02.16]Too fast?
[55:22.01]Well, the autofocus, fucking autofocus.
[55:34.18]Stop autofocusing.
[55:44.38]Alright, I'm done.

[56:51.09]And then like this?
[56:54.55]I don't remember what it was.
[56:55.65]What did I do?
[56:58.23]I don't know what I did.
[56:58.83]I think it was like that and like that.
[57:07.60]So it would be like, huh, yeah.

[57:20.67]Look at me.
[57:21.17]Look at me.
[57:22.57]That's what you sound like.
[57:27.33]Why do I have to hit someone?
[57:32.94]Why do I have to slap somebody?
[57:39.24]Okay.

[74:45.25]Whoa, but be careful.
[74:47.08]We may demonetize your entire channel because nobody works here.
[74:50.98]We just kind of put bots up that catch random shit and you might be caught in the crossfire.
[74:55.77]But this is your space.
[74:57.69]Right here.
[74:58.85]Oh, we've ruined entire channels because we demonetized the entire channel?
[75:02.87]Don't worry about that.
[75:04.39]This is what you need to be concerned with.
[75:07.60]Right here.
[75:12.40]I'll be going this way now.
[75:25.69]So passive-aggressive.
[75:35.27]That wasn't even part of the show.
[75:48.40]Oh, I gotta do this one, too.
[75:49.42]Oh, by the way,
[75:55.76]Disclaimer.
[75:56.38]Hey, it's me again.

[78:00.61]I'm probably like, I'm probably like 150,000 feet.
[78:02.93]That's not how I'm going to score this.
[78:14.45]Holy shit, it worked.
[78:46.65]Side view is necessary.
[79:04.38]This is your space.
[79:09.52]Why do people do this?
[79:11.19]There's no reason to do what I'm doing right now.
[79:13.23]If you were falling, you wouldn't be going like this.
[79:17.09]You'd just be like... Why do we... What is this?
[79:28.70]Whoa!

[92:01.35]I'm definitely not going to dab.
[92:02.59]This needs to be over here.
[92:24.43]Why is this doing this?
[92:25.17]Come on, man.
[92:25.46]Give me a break.
[92:36.86]Give me a break.
[92:58.09]Too small?
[92:59.89]I mean, I could move it forward.
[93:01.01]Maybe that'll help a little.
[93:02.67]Right there.
[93:08.02]That should be good.
[93:10.00]That should be good.
[93:13.18]Yeah, that's good.
[93:14.00]Alright, so what's next?
[93:24.09]It's on a slant.
[93:25.49]It just looks like that because this thing is actually really annoying actually.
[93:32.16]Hold on.
[93:33.88]Why the fuck is this doing this?
[93:38.04]I wish it wouldn't do that.
[93:42.90]Move the tripod a little.
[93:49.40]It's the tripod.
[93:52.09]I had it before.
[93:54.91]This needs to come up a little bit like this.
[94:02.88]Yeah, how the fuck does that make any sense?
[94:07.40]That makes no sense.
[94:08.30]Because the tripod says it's level.
[94:21.49]I think maybe it's the way it's painted.
[94:24.66]It looks like it's a little bit of an edge over here that goes a little further in or further out.
[94:36.94]How's that?
[94:47.49]Yeah, I think it just looks like that because the way that the ground is over here.
[94:50.33]Alright, let's go.
[95:04.85]So, slowly peeking to frame.
[95:08.48]How am I going to do this?
[95:09.34]This is going to be fucking hard.
[95:11.14]I'm going to get hurt doing this one, so I hope you're ready to see me get actually fucking injured.
[95:54.81]belly.
[95:57.69]We saw his belly.
[96:10.00]Alright, here we go.
[96:23.71]I'm sorry that I have to do this.
[96:33.63]Who put that in there?
[97:01.39]That was one of the most requested things.
[97:12.84]Alright, act like I'm shaking hands with somebody.
[97:15.08]I don't know why, and then swimming.
[97:20.36]And then it's time to move on to the actual reactions.
[97:25.14]Hey, how are you?
[97:28.62]Good to see you, man.
[97:31.70]Oh, that's a nice, firm handshake.
[97:33.62]Okay.
[97:35.72]Okay.
[97:36.53]You can let go.
[97:38.39]Thanks, man.
[97:39.03]That's a good handshake you got there.
[97:43.39]Hey.
[97:44.51]Hey, it's been so long.
[97:45.87]Hey, how are you?
[97:46.83]Keep going.
[97:47.41]Right here.
[97:47.89]There, that's, yes.
[97:49.71]Good to see you.
[97:54.64]Put her there.
[97:55.60]That's it.
[97:57.96]No.
[97:58.74]Okay.
[98:01.51]Good to see you, Mike.
[98:10.55]Hey!
[98:10.77]Hey!
[98:11.31]Right there, good to see you.
[98:12.71]Good to like you a little.
[98:27.42]I'll give these, we'll do it from here.
[98:33.10]Hey!
[98:35.30]Yeah, I'd love to shake your hand.
[98:38.30]Fuck yeah, man.
[98:39.84]So, you still doing that thing?
[98:41.72]You still in school?
[98:45.80]Let's do the other one, too.
[98:47.10]Hey!
[98:58.69]Hey!
[99:01.89]Tim!
[99:03.17]Oh my God, it's good to see you.
[99:04.75]Thanks, man.
[99:06.01]Yeah, it's great to see you again.
[99:15.97]Tim?
[99:17.87]Tim Davidson!
[99:19.95]What?
[99:20.52]Hey, man.
[99:22.60]How are you?
[99:25.24]No shit.
[99:27.20]I got two of my own.
[99:30.16]What's this?
[99:31.30]That's just my new car.
[99:32.50]Yeah.
[99:33.76]It's beauty, isn't she?
[99:36.82]I souped her up too.
[99:38.88]V6 engine.
[99:39.41]What do you got back there?
[99:42.55]Ooh.
[99:45.85]Not as good as mine, but still worth having in your garage.
[99:50.67]Anyways, great.
[99:51.69]That's great that you're doing so well.
[99:54.04]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[99:54.46]No, you gotta go.
[99:54.92]I just caught you.
[99:58.38]Let me get back.
[99:58.80]Let me get into this little thing over here.
[100:00.74]You know what I mean?
[100:01.70]Good to see you again.
[100:03.06]Yeah.
[100:04.60]Take care of yourself.
[100:18.53]See you later, man.
[100:34.08]I do have a wheel.
[100:41.27]It's a horse.
[100:50.68]There's some serious hydraulics in that car.
[101:04.39]Oh!
[101:29.77]That was me getting on a horse.
[101:32.94]I was me on a horse.
[101:34.30]I was on a horse.
[101:35.34]That's a horse.
[101:36.46]That's me on a horse, and that's the thing that you hold.
[101:46.08]Delete the stream.
[101:47.10]Delete the whole stream.
[101:48.42]Delete the stream.
[101:49.21]Delete the stream.
[101:50.85]Delete's over.
[101:52.25]Delete it.
[101:53.15]Delete the stream.
[102:01.71]Delete.
[102:02.61]Don't.
[102:04.31]Nobody.
[102:04.69]Idiots.
[102:23.55]Nobody use that.
[102:24.79]Nobody use that.
[102:26.57]You'll be in big trouble.
[102:46.05]What an old joke.
[102:48.49]Puppet stream.
[102:50.45]I don't even have a sock on.
[102:51.69]Well, I just, whatever.
[102:53.26]Alright, we're almost done with the actions.
[102:56.06]I have to swim now.
[102:56.78]Can't you just like, can't you just do swimming and, can't swimming and flying be the same thing?
[103:04.27]Well, I guess I was fucking screaming, so that doesn't work.
[103:15.68]This is flying.
[103:17.54]I'm just flying again.
[103:47.37]I almost got the crushing.
[104:01.54]Almost had it.
[104:21.25]He can't swim.
[104:23.30]How does he not know how to swim?
[104:24.86]Just wait, wait, hold on.
[104:28.14]There's more to that.
[105:02.16]Alright, I'm done with swimming.
[105:03.16]I'm done with swimming.
[105:04.52]Swimming's done.
[105:13.57]This is a huge green screen.
[105:19.21]Contemplating life choices.
[105:21.05]Alright, here we go.
[105:33.50]So here's where we're gonna do some reactions.
[105:36.36]We're like just about, we're pretty much more than halfway done.
[105:40.35]Well, actually there's a lot of, oh my God, there's so much shit.
[105:46.61]We're like 30, 40% of the way done.
[105:49.85]Alright, here we go.
[105:54.78]This is what you waited for.
[105:55.78]So we got all the actions out of the way.
[105:57.06]Now here we go, this is what you wanted.
[106:03.80]Now this is by far, this is the best part right here.
[106:10.30]This is my favorite part.
[106:12.76]This is the best part.
[106:14.83]Shh, stop talking, this is the best part.
[106:18.15]Nice.
[106:27.11]This is terrible.
[106:30.29]Absolutely terrible.
[106:33.30]Nothing about this is good.
[106:35.10]Not one thing.
[106:38.74]God, I hate this.
[106:40.92]I hate this.
[106:41.75]This is terrible.
[106:49.15]What a gamer.
[106:51.89]What a god of a gamer, seriously.
[107:07.69]This is the thing I'm talking about right here.
[107:10.05]I've told you guys this before.
[107:13.05]Absolute perfection.
[107:15.55]No ifs, ands, or buts.
[107:17.67]This right here is absolute perfection.
[107:35.56]What a gamer.
[107:37.39]Hold on, hold on, this will work.
[107:47.63]Wow.
[107:50.20]Wow.
[107:52.04]This is what it looks like up close.
[107:55.48]From back there, it could have been anything.
[107:59.38]This is perfect.
[108:00.34]This is exactly what I was talking about.
[108:12.59]Turn it off.
[108:14.19]Are you in charge of this?
[108:15.91]Turn it off.
[108:17.81]Get to shut this off.
[108:18.63]Shut them all off.
[108:19.81]Turn your lights in your house off, too.
[108:33.74]You really fucking watching this shit?
[108:41.08]Please.
[108:43.34]Oh my god!
[108:47.57]Fucking god, terrible.
[108:58.22]Yeah!
[109:00.46]Yes!
[109:04.28]That's it!
[109:25.51]Okay, so, hold on, I'm gonna do this one.
[109:36.10]Whoa.
[109:42.26]So this is the virtual world.
[109:45.64]Cut, take two.
[109:52.40]Wow.
[109:57.46]So this is the virtual world.
[109:59.36]Why can I not say that?
[110:04.12]Virtual world, virtual world.
[110:12.34]Whoa.
[110:19.03]So this is the virtual world.
[110:23.55]It's amazing.
[110:31.73]Fascinating.
[110:43.82]Alright.
[110:50.52]Now, how am I going to do this?
[110:52.71]I have to get shot at like a laser.
[111:01.34]It's time to close.
[111:04.87]I want to keep the actions in the same close though, because if people are going to be cutting between stuff, then they kind of need continuity.
[111:12.79]So let me get through most of the actions.
[111:40.91]You got me.
[111:49.72]You got me.
[111:54.18]You got me.
[112:35.68]What a way to die.
[112:43.05]They're giving birth.
[113:20.98]I have to make the noise, man.
[113:32.89]Alright, here we go.
[113:34.25]It's almost time to bring out the props.
[113:35.71]Alright, so here we go.
[113:41.42]Hold on, give me one second.
[113:52.80]Camera's too high.
[113:53.58]Alright, so where is... I don't know why this looks so off.
[114:16.34]Sorry, I just minimized my action list here.
[114:19.78]Okay.
[114:21.70]So now I need to frantically run around as if the building is on fire.
[114:38.36]Oh, no!
[114:39.68]Oh, no, no, no, no!
[114:42.42]No!
[114:44.82]Oh!
[114:45.82]Oh!
[115:20.05]This next one is sleep and be startled by something.
[115:50.53]Yeah.
[115:51.15]Yeah.
[116:05.88]Yeah.
[116:26.39]Okay, I'll do a five-minute pause.
[116:28.39]Why do I need, like, jeans and... I gotta go, like, pajamas on.
[116:31.99]Hold on.
[116:32.45]Wait, wait, wait.
[116:38.24]Costume change.
[116:39.14]How am I gonna put these up properly?
[116:56.77]I'm gonna heat up to like a thousand degrees.
[117:00.00]Okay.
[117:15.90]My Star Wars pajamas.
[117:39.02]No.
[117:39.60]No, you do it.
[117:44.00]You do it.
[117:47.38]I'm sleeping.
[117:54.34]Yeah.
[117:58.15]OK, Mom.
[118:18.45]Five more minutes, Mom.
[118:23.61]Mom!
[118:33.16]Hey, Mom?
[118:35.98]Can I have a glass of water?
[118:42.56]No!
[118:43.74]I want a glass!
[118:45.00]Okay, I'm getting the fuck up.
[118:52.91]Fucking tantrum.
[118:54.35]I'm not having a tantrum on the ground over there at 33.
[118:56.73]Wow.
[119:12.36]Wow, did I just fuck this up?
[119:16.55]No, we're good.
[119:18.01]No, we're good.
[119:18.51]Alright, so now...
[119:23.91]I need my phone back.
[119:25.33]Where the fuck is that?
[119:26.29]It's gonna have, like, fucking tantrums.
[119:36.34]Uh, so now we're gonna deal with the weather in my pajamas.
[119:48.09]Okay, here we go.
[119:50.79]Oh my god, it's having, like, no shoes on.
[120:31.20]Let's get close.
[121:03.19]Alright, here we go.
[121:05.72]Fighting game moves?
[121:06.84]Don't worry, I'm gonna do it.
[121:09.42]Alright, rain.
[121:12.82]I don't have an umbrella, fuck.
[121:28.54]Why would you put your hands up?
[121:30.38]Out of the rain in your pajamas.
[121:38.11]Alright, so now I got this one.
[121:54.31]Oh.
[121:58.41]If I don't move, it won't see me.
[122:16.63]Costume change.
[122:19.71]Still in PJs.
[122:27.98]Oh, this one's gonna be good.
[122:32.92]This one's gonna be good.
[122:33.66]No.
[122:55.78]God damn it!
[122:58.51]Transitioning into... Shit!
[123:09.26]God damn it!
[123:13.96]It's stinging my blood!
[123:24.02]Honey detected.
[123:25.62]Nice costume change.
[123:32.40]I walked off the green screen.
[123:33.76]Fuck!
[123:37.00]Alright, you ready?
[123:38.84]Are you ready for me to do prop related material?
[123:49.51]Hell fuck.
[123:52.19]Here we go.
[123:55.06]I'm just gonna take, I'm just gonna be in my fucking pajama.
[123:57.98]I'm not gonna put a tie on right now.
[124:08.84]I'm gonna look like such a fucking idiot.
[124:10.68]I have three pairs of pants on.
[124:15.87]I have literally three, I have jeans, pajamas, and now suit pants on over that.
[124:28.85]I'm gonna look like such a good drunk.
[124:31.48]Like my tie is gonna be undone.
[124:33.39]I'm gonna be like a drunk guy at a wedding.
[125:01.77]With, like, socks.
[125:05.61]Just imagine I drank, like, fucking a pint of vodka.
[125:13.34]I don't fucking care about this tie.
[125:19.58]I got a t-shirt on.
[125:53.95]Yeah.
[125:54.71]Alright.
[125:56.01]Looking good.
[126:01.26]Chip's got a fucking clip on.
[126:31.05]Good afternoon, everybody.
[126:38.21]Welcome to the fucking clown news.
[126:40.14]Oh.
[126:54.27]I gotta keep it like that, though.
[126:55.53]That's so fucking funny.
[126:56.97]Is either of these zipped up?
[127:06.94]Okay, here we go.
[127:13.91]That's right, Diane.
[127:14.95]As you can tell,
[127:16.28]There's a cold front coming down through California here over Mississippi.
[127:22.37]That's going to be about 45 degrees cooler than you typically would have out there in the Midwest.
[127:28.39]Put the next slide up, please.
[127:35.13]That's correct, Diane.
[127:36.03]So as you see here, Massachusetts has got a little bit of a hot front coming in.
[127:41.10]95 degrees is what you're looking at here.
[127:42.96]Halloween weekend is going to be a little bit tough for you there.
[127:45.00]Make sure you bundle up.
[127:45.80]Make sure you get a lot of hats on.
[127:48.96]So next weekend, we've got two.
[127:51.32]That's right, two.
[127:57.15]Oh, wait.
[127:57.37]Did this frame die?
[127:58.01]Are we good?
[128:07.04]Are we still fine?
[128:14.82]Okay.
[128:19.29]Good.
[128:23.37]That's right, Diane.
[128:24.23]It's going to be a cold one this weekend.
[128:26.05]As you can see here, we've got some low pressure coming up through the mountains here going all the way down over southern New Hampshire.
[128:33.52]That's right.
[128:33.90]It's going to make its way down here
[128:35.98]across the Nile River there, and then it's going to wrap back around and come back towards Massachusetts, which then, unfortunately, your Saturday football game is going to get potentially rained out.
[128:47.87]As you see, two, that's right, two cold fronts coming from here and from here.
[128:54.73]And it's going to be a breezy one.
[128:56.29]They're going to collide together and they may be a gosh darn tornado.
[128:59.71]So you better bundle up out there and make sure you have anti-tornado clothing on and anti-tornado hats because they might blow away.
[129:06.28]Diane?
[129:11.82]I'm not so sure about that one.
[129:12.92]It's going to be a hot one.
[129:14.22]That's right.
[129:15.58]It's going to be a hot one out there, Diane.
[129:17.33]As you can see, look at how big that sun is.
[129:19.85]Look at how big that is.
[129:21.26]I don't even need to tell you temperature numbers.
[129:23.03]That's just a big ol' sun, ain't it there?
[129:25.63]And it's gonna be shining across the entire US of A, that's right.
[129:29.39]Sun here, sunshine over here, and even sunshine down here.
[129:33.17]Where you don't typically get it, if you know what I'm saying.
[129:36.22]So, bundle up out there, it's gonna be a cold one.
[129:38.76]Every day's a cold one with the sun out there.
[129:42.32]And Diane, go fuck yourself!
[129:51.18]Wow!
[130:00.06]You know, typically I bring you the weather on a daily basis at 6 a.m., 6 a.m.
[130:06.33]in the morning with Diane, Carol, and Rick.
[130:10.77]But today, I want to show you something different.
[130:13.69]Besides the fact that, first, be aware, we are going to have some snow over here in the Colorado Rockies.
[130:20.83]Coming through here, down into the southern part of Colorado.
[130:24.72]But forget that.
[130:26.92]I want to show you something that I care about.
[130:29.72]Something that I want to show.
[130:31.52]That I had no opportunity to do until now.
[130:38.18]That's me on my fishing trip.
[130:41.06]That's me and my son.
[130:44.15]Yeah.
[130:46.61]I just wanted to show it.
[130:51.51]There we go.
[130:54.03]And back to the weather.
[130:55.56]We do have, like I said, some cold.
[130:58.82]Ron, who cares about this?
[131:02.04]America, go out and live your lives.
[131:05.48]Don't worry about the weather.
[131:06.98]You just go outside and sniff.
[131:08.94]You'll be just fine.
[131:10.68]It's gonna be cold some days.
[131:12.06]It's gonna be hot some days.
[131:14.14]Just go out there.
[131:16.21]Go out there and live.
[131:22.75]Diane?
[131:33.58]Why is the tie three-fourths the size?
[131:35.86]Alright, so now here's another one.
[131:37.88]I have to get the tie off for this one.
[131:40.73]Here's the last one.
[131:41.43]We'll do one more weather.
[131:51.58]Hey, it's me.
[131:52.65]That's right, Diane.
[131:53.69]We got the wacky weather report coming up here.
[131:56.59]That was my nose.
[131:57.67]So as you see here, it's going to be, wow, it's going to be breezy tomorrow night.
[132:02.46]So make sure you stay indoors.
[132:04.52]60 mile per hour gusts.
[132:06.18]Be careful out there.
[132:07.44]Whoa, easy.
[132:09.52]Next up, oh, of course, got to tell you, the local pumpkin festival is going to be canceled because...
[132:16.61]Oh no!
[132:17.27]It's raining outside!
[132:20.75]Back to you, Diane.
[132:21.65]Diane, will you marry me?
[132:44.47]That was just Jim Carrey.
[132:52.89]He looks like he wears .
[133:00.69]That's right.
[133:01.97]Here's the weather.
[133:05.95]Yeah, the roads are going to be slick.
[133:15.84]Especially on that road there.
[133:17.32]That one over here.
[133:21.37]I think this is going to be at least two or three.
[133:23.95]I don't know.
[133:26.85]Just look.
[133:27.47]This is, I think, two or three different weathers that are going to come together and find a dual weather scenario.
[133:34.36]I don't know.
[133:38.30]I don't care.
[133:40.39]Fuck this job.
[133:42.23]I went out last night and I got destroyed.
[133:44.05]Alright, here we go.
[134:11.84]Now I have to accept an award.
[134:16.44]No time for this one.
[134:35.62]Nice!
[134:38.50]Thank you.
[134:51.99]Well, thanks, everybody.
[134:52.87]I just want to say, being the number one streamer on Twitch, it was a dream come true.
[135:03.24]I never thought I would be here.
[135:04.28]I never thought I would be able to get to the stage in my life where I was the number one most viewed, number one most subscribed, number one most watched.
[135:11.32]We're bigger than ESPN now.
[135:12.68]So I mean, right?
[135:14.85]Yep.
[135:16.05]That's a fan.
[135:16.57]That's a fan up there, guys.
[135:20.76]So it's ridiculous that now I'm able to buy Disney, which I never thought I'd be able to do.
[135:27.05]I swear to God, I'm going to make The Incredibles 3.
[135:29.21]Yep.
[135:30.29]So thank you, everybody, so much for all that you've done.
[135:33.57]Yeah.
[135:34.57]We made it.
[135:35.15]We did it.
[135:37.02]Well, I did.
[135:42.50]I did.
[135:43.80]But yeah.
[135:45.54]Yeah.
[135:46.12]Thank you.
[135:47.89]I'll see you all.
[135:48.93]Hey.
[135:49.64]Tuesdays and Thursdays and Fridays.
[135:53.06]What's that?
[135:55.86]Yeah.
[135:59.73]Okay.
[136:00.07]Well, I'm not going to play Minecraft ever again, but thanks for the enthusiasm.
[136:07.47]I will see you guys real soon, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
[136:10.37]Much love to you.
[136:10.99]Thank you for this award.
[136:11.99]Thank you for this.
[136:14.17]You guys are amazing.
[136:15.07]Thank you.
[136:21.73]Alright, one more of these.
[136:42.71]Got it!
[136:43.65]Yes!
[136:46.47]Alright!
[136:48.75]Wow!
[136:50.80]Whoa!
[136:51.95]I never thought that I would be winning this award.
[136:55.76]Unbelievable.
[136:57.46]Let me just say, from the bottom of my heart, thank you for all of your support and for all of your wonderful contributions.
[137:08.36]I must say, it's been quite a year.
[137:12.63]Quite a year, in fact, that I've got two more games to announce.
[137:17.55]That's right, two more games.
[137:21.14]with the most ingenuity and the highest caliber of skill that any of our developers have ever done, it is my pleasure to announce our latest title.
[137:45.07]Never before has there ever been quite a scenario like this one.
[137:53.46]Diablo Immortal is nothing to do with me.
[137:57.64]I'm not gonna make a Blizzard reference because I have nothing to do with this.
[138:03.22]I have a different game to show you.
[138:05.60]Here it is.
[138:08.64]I can't go down that road.
[138:18.89]That's right.
[138:19.53]Hey, hey.
[138:24.54]Are there any gamers in here?
[138:25.52]Of course there is.
[138:30.82]Got quite a lineup this year.
[138:33.46]Last year we saw some of the best games, highly reviewed, that we've ever had as a company here.
[138:41.77]And we have you all to thank.
[138:44.69]Our average Metacritic score reached over 58.
[138:48.37]Yep.
[138:54.10]And I find it completely necessary to now show you, the fans, a brand new experience that you won't have anywhere else.
[139:07.15]We're talking about complete open world, complete open environment, and complete and total control over your surroundings.
[139:17.69]Yeah, you knew it was coming, but were you ready for this?
[139:23.96]I present to you, made with me and my wife and our three kids, WorldZone.
[139:42.50]There we go, okay, thank you.
[139:45.02]WorldZone is a PVP-inspired, top-down, FPS,
[139:53.86]hyphen strategy game.
[139:59.42]Here's some gameplay footage of it now.
[140:04.45]You'll get this in your hands as soon as Monday!
[140:11.27]Monday!
[140:11.87]Like I'm talking about tomorrow.
[140:13.77]You understand?
[140:14.53]You're gonna get this game on Monday.
[140:17.09]Monday, Monday, Monday.
[140:19.07]You're gonna get this game on Monday.
[140:25.61]This Monday.
[140:28.71]And that's my time.
[140:30.39]Get your hands on it Monday.
[140:31.37]Have a great rest of your conference.
[140:44.34]Tell him about the shoes.
[141:04.42]Whatever.
[141:09.52]No, I'm not redoing it with shoes on.
[141:16.04]Alright.
[141:18.08]There you go.
[141:22.98]Now I'm going to bring in a couple of props.
[141:29.05]This is a baseball.
[141:31.69]I have socks in this one too.
[142:29.50]Here's what I have to say about this.
[142:32.18]See this bullshit?
[142:32.98]Get that out of here.
[142:44.79]No, no, no.
[142:46.60]No, turn it off.
[142:47.68]Turn it off.
[142:48.74]Turn it off.
[143:29.54]Don't destroy the green screen.
[143:33.38]Alright, hold on.
[143:52.90]This was an incredibly highly requested thing, and I don't know why, but you'll see.
[144:22.95]I really have no idea why somebody wanted me to do this.
[145:09.57]Gah!
[146:02.67]He's getting into it.
[146:03.89]Nobody asked for that.
[146:14.13]That was like one of the top requested things.
[146:16.20]Put on the suit.
[146:25.88]I'm not putting the suit on and doing that.
[146:32.63]This one was highly requested too.
[146:34.06]Here, I'll give you this one.
[147:21.57]There's your letter.
[147:22.75]Is this?
[147:29.46]Somebody wanted, uh, driving.
[147:31.38]Here's the Labo wheel.
[148:58.41]Every various driving sequences.
[149:03.73]Do it over the shoulder.
[149:04.85]I mean like this.
[149:06.80]Whoa, Jesus.
[149:18.04]Yeah.
[149:23.61]Taking you guys on the scenic route.
[149:33.58]Careful.
[149:40.36]Whoa, whoa.
[149:46.62]Hey kids, you wanna sing a car song?
[149:50.31]I don't either.
[150:05.95]Hey.
[150:07.71]Dave, right?
[150:09.17]Hey.
[150:09.61]Welcome to Lyft.
[150:10.17]So you're from here?
[150:21.17]Yeah.
[150:22.40]I grew up here.
[150:24.76]I know all the secrets.
[150:25.58]Don't, like, turn off your GPS.
[150:27.38]I know where I'm going.
[150:34.04]What's up?
[150:34.34]Yeah.
[150:36.62]No, I've been driving for probably a couple years now on Lyft.
[150:43.16]Right.
[150:46.02]Yeah.
[150:49.25]Yeah, I moved here when I was probably 19 or so.
[150:55.11]Yeah.
[150:57.39]Oh, shit, sorry, yeah, sorry.
[151:02.81]It's a great place.
[151:03.55]You'll probably like it.
[151:14.06]He's off-roading.
[151:16.52]He talked too much.
[151:19.40]Do one facing you now.
[151:22.32]How would that make any sense?
[151:30.95]Hey, yeah.
[151:36.37]Yeah, I live around here.
[151:37.45]I've lived here for about 10 years.
[151:44.71]Can you not do that?
[151:49.21]Can you relax back there, please?
[151:52.63]What you're doing is incredibly distracting, that's all.
[151:58.42]I'll get you out of the car if you don't.
[152:05.52]Jesus!
[152:05.96]Did you see that?
[152:14.36]Why am I going back and forth like this?
[152:23.60]No, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[152:25.68]I'm good.
[152:28.08]Oh shit.
[152:43.81]Holy shit.

[153:05.94]You want me to go like this?
[153:08.75]Hey, how are you?
[153:10.39]How you doing?
[153:12.01]How are things?
[153:19.21]Just don't talk.
[153:21.91]What?
[153:35.31]Why am I doing that?
[153:36.19]Alright, I'm done.
[153:44.57]Alright.
[153:46.94]Let me get her water.
[153:48.53]We're getting to the end here.
[153:49.55]There's still only maybe five or ten things left to do.
[153:56.69]Oh, hold on.
[154:00.31]This is important.
[154:02.37]Somebody wanted this real bad.
[154:15.18]I need the suit.
[154:31.29]About the James Bond thing.
[155:00.24]at this stage, apparently.
[155:16.94]I need shoes.
[155:17.68]Alright, hold on.
[155:20.24]I have to make it.
[155:21.24]I'm going over right now.

[155:26.88]Give me one second.
[155:29.48]Let me write BRB on the screen.
[155:31.38]We got maybe five or 10 things left to do.
[155:40.45]Shoeless.
[155:42.79]Here, hold on.
[155:44.72]Give me a few minutes.
[155:46.30]I'll be right back.
[155:53.26]I need text on here.
[155:58.36]No, I'm not putting the dinosaur thing on ever again.
[156:01.76]You got your one, like, what a fucking joke.
[156:05.76]That was so bad.
[156:17.97]Like, I am embarrassed.
[156:19.99]I bought that shit, you know what I mean?
[156:21.25]I'll be right back.
[157:52.74]I'm not back yet, by the way.
[157:53.80]I just wanted to make sure I made this really, really clear.
[157:57.88]So I've been drinking water out of the sink this whole time.
[158:06.13]Like literally like drinking like toilet, like the water in the toilet.
[158:10.55]They have like a water thing here.

[160:48.02]What did I put, why do I have this?
[161:04.47]It's perfect.
[161:07.90]It's the Undertaker.

[170:22.12]I want you to delete that whole thing.

[171:58.21]I mean, this is my house.
[172:01.23]And it's much better than yours.
[172:10.84]Well, I do got a pretty sweet house.
[172:14.19]Way better than your Minecraft house, dude.
[172:38.55]What's that?
[172:40.23]Oh, you like!
[172:41.74]You like what I have here, don't you?
[172:43.30]Yeah.
[172:44.87]Well, how do you think I made it?
[173:06.96]Alright, let's open the mind around.
[173:52.88]What?
[173:55.52]Is he taking requests?
[173:57.86]Yes.
[173:58.86]When I'm done with all the ones that I want to do, we'll take requests.
[174:05.29]Oh my god, this looks like shit.
[174:21.02]And don't forget about me, the newest turtle, Socrates.
[174:24.79]I may be small, but I've sure got lots of power.
[174:45.03]And don't forget about me, the newest turtle, Socrates.
[174:48.33]With my trusty curve blade, I slash those putties like nobody's business.
[174:53.50]Check me out.
[174:54.54]You'll see a little bit of footage right here.
[175:21.72]That's right, Donatello.
[175:23.20]And we should all eat our vegetables, like... That's right, Donatello.
[175:38.67]And another thing, eat your vegetables and fruits too.
[175:41.53]They make you grow up big and strong like us turtles.
[175:43.97]Like me, Leonardo.
[175:50.48]You can do stuff like that when you're older.
[175:52.44]Not a great example.
[175:57.83]Alright, here we go.
[176:32.47]There's too many of them.
[176:34.48]There's too many of them.
[177:32.63]Princess Bride?
[177:33.81]God dammit, I did the same thing I just did again.
[177:44.12]Here's the only difference.
[177:59.19]I can't wear this.
[178:26.43]I look like a fucking idiot.
[178:38.46]This is made for a kid.
[178:39.64]This is supposed to be down here.
[178:42.26]This is made for like a fucking seven year old.
[178:50.95]I'm in like an X-wing.
[178:57.83]Fighter one, what's your status?
[179:02.65]That's right, let's take it to them hot guys, come on.
[179:08.86]Watch your six.
[179:13.94]I can't see him, I can't get him, I can't get him, I can't see him.
[179:24.23]Uh-uh, that is a negative here, man.
[179:28.53]Hey, maybe you can get us a few rounds when we're done with this, you know what I'm saying?
[179:37.66]Watch out, watch out, TIE Fighters, TIE Fighters coming in!
[179:40.66]Left side, right side.
[179:44.06]Got him, got him, watch your tail there, I'm right behind you.
[179:49.62]Yeah!
[179:50.84]Yeah!
[179:55.68]I'm going down.
[179:57.39]No, I'm going down, I'm going down.
[179:59.71]This is, this is fighter one, I'm going down.
[180:01.71]Fighter one, I'm going down.
[180:04.31]Uh-oh.
[180:07.65]Mayday!
[180:33.73]No.
[180:41.09]I think I got this.
[180:42.91]I'm gonna need it here.
[180:43.85]This is the strangest plant I think I've ever been to.
[180:51.16]Don't start with me here.
[181:01.61]I am a pilot, but I'm also a Jedi too.
[181:31.88]I can't take this.
[181:33.50]Why would I take it serious?
[181:44.98]I'm trying to close it.
[181:50.83]It won't close.
[181:51.31]Oh, man.
[181:58.79]I already broke it.
[182:14.37]I don't think I can do... There we go.
[182:22.37]Okay.
[182:22.49]Let's try this again.
[182:24.03]No.
[182:33.33]Really.
[182:42.66]I just have to let you know.
[182:45.09]You strike me down now, and I will become so much stronger than you.
[182:50.78]I'll be at least a full tier up on a fighting game list than you.
[183:33.38]And that was just me showing off.
[183:35.92]It's time for the real fight.
[184:11.85]Easy for you to say.
[184:13.31]You're an evil Sith.
[184:15.65]But not me.
[184:17.93]I'm a Jedi.
[184:25.19]Oh!
[184:27.67]Please don't kill me.

[187:29.82]Alright, that's it.
[187:30.34]We're moving away from Star Wars.
[187:32.16]I'm done with Star Wars.

[191:56.07]Oh, I forgot about this one.
[192:04.75]We gotta put this on.

[195:15.81]This is a Gears of War shit, isn't it?
[195:19.71]There's a bit like a chainsaw sound in here.

[199:26.03]It's not gonna work.
[199:40.58]Hold on.
[199:44.07]That seems like a green mask.
[199:45.65]I could probably do this.
[200:01.10]Two different greens.
[200:17.92]I'm just wearing a dress.
[200:25.30]Frieza versus Goku.
[200:26.90]I already did all my spirit bombs.

[201:37.01]Alright.
[201:39.19]Let's move on to some meme shit.
[201:40.51]Start with this one.

[202:08.87]Well, if two in the hand is worth one in the bush, looks like this guy went shush.
[202:26.05]Well, you know what they say, smoke them if you got them.
[202:38.51]You know, my mother always told me, be a good boy.
[202:43.41]Yeah.

[205:00.19]We know what they say.
[205:02.30]Two is more than one.
[205:06.08]Alright, that's one.
[205:23.46]Next up is, uh, what was the other meme shit?
[205:28.18]It was the JoJo poses.
[205:31.69]I don't have any idea what the fuck.
[205:35.03]What was the other one?
[205:37.87]What was the other meme one?
[205:51.88]Oh, okay, right, right.
[205:53.06]It was the snaps.
[205:53.96]Alright, so I need... Spoilers for Infinity War, if you haven't seen it yet.
[206:03.92]You have.
[206:05.26]You've fucking seen Infinity War.

[206:10.00]Not one of you has not seen it.
[206:12.13]But, mute for the next 45 minutes.
[206:25.05]Gah!
[207:00.01]I don't even have an affinity gauntlet on.
[207:06.52]I'm just like, I'm just a guy.
[207:20.78]You should have gone for the head.
[207:23.70]And because of this, I'm gonna do it with two hands and everyone dies.
[207:33.29]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, that means me too.
[207:35.25]No, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, that means me.
[207:36.99]No, no, no, I do not take it back.
[207:48.56]Hey, this is dark.

[207:51.60]Oh, here I go.
[207:52.68]No, no, no, no, no, no, I don't want to talk, I don't want to talk.
[208:02.17]I don't want to go.
[208:02.89]I don't want to go.
[208:05.33]Please, please, Mr. Stark.
[208:06.31]Please, Mr. Stark.
[208:19.72]I don't feel so good.
[208:21.79]I don't feel so good.
[208:25.79]How about this?
[208:30.32]No, no, I don't feel so good.
[208:35.71]That's all it took is to put myself back together.
[208:43.37]To get the particles back in me.
[208:56.92]Do the slap chop.
[209:00.73]Hey, it's Vince with the Slap Chop.
[209:02.13]Yeah, you're gonna slap, you're gonna cry, your onions cry, you're making me cry.
[209:05.39]Yeah, throw it in the fuckin' sink.
[209:07.14]So, what we got here, quickest tuna salad you ever made.
[209:09.88]Here we go, slap it a couple times.
[209:11.24]One, two, three.
[209:12.82]Easy as pie.
[209:13.66]Just in thing, the thing, to clean it, it opens up like a butterfly.
[209:17.42]See, take a look at that.
[209:18.62]See, it's easy.
[209:19.94]No mess, no bullshit.
[209:21.84]Throw it in the fuckin' sink behind me.
[209:26.51]Oh my God, I almost just died.
[209:32.60]Alright, time to do some JoJo poses.
[209:41.85]That was turning into Trump.
[209:46.99]Alright.
[210:01.71]I'm looking at, I looked at, somebody sent me like a compilation.
[210:08.02]Jojo poses.
[210:11.36]Which one am I typing in?
[210:13.46]I'll do like three or four of them.
[210:20.85]Am I going to hate this for the rest of my life?
[210:23.23]What's worse?
[210:25.23]Like, honestly, what's worse, Jojo poses or the Velociraptor?
[210:39.79]Really?
[210:42.09]The Velociraptor is probably the worst thing I've ever done.
[210:45.01]I mean, in my whole life.
[210:46.69]In my actual entire life.
[210:49.87]I can't think of anything that I would rather go back and redo.
[210:54.79]You know, if I had a time machine, it was like, oh, hey, you could go back and fix one thing.
[210:58.01]What would you fix?
[211:00.65]It would be me doing that Velociraptor.
[211:02.59]Now I understand why somebody wanted me to do it.
[211:04.61]Now I get it why it was like one of the things that somebody put in the channel there.
[211:08.70]Because holy shit, that was the most embarrassing thing I've ever done.
[211:12.02]And I can never take it back.
[211:13.32]And it was on a green screen, so now it could be used anywhere.
[211:26.50]Alright, so could some of the mods help me out here?
[211:30.56]I don't know what these are.
[211:36.89]Are there any mods that know JoJo at all?
[211:47.88]JoJo is embarrassing.
[211:49.70]Everyone's telling me it is.
[211:50.84]I don't know.
[211:51.92]I know like three JoJo.
[211:58.09]Somebody help me.
[212:01.67]Okay, JoJo poses.
[212:03.23]I'm just going to look at a video and try to recreate it.
[212:07.92]Okay, here's only the best JoJo poses.
[212:11.16]I can't do half of these.
[212:20.69]Alright, I'll do this one.
[212:32.46]I need to look at it one more time.
[212:36.88]So this one looks like it goes like this.
[212:40.72]It goes like that.
[213:00.49]That was awful.
[213:02.01]That was practicing.
[213:07.56]So his hand comes up like here.
[213:08.60]So he goes like that.
[213:13.73]Alright, let's pick another one.

[213:42.91]You go like this?
[213:49.28]Like this?
[213:49.80]Does it go like... Oh, that hurts my body to do it.
[214:23.94]worse than the Raptor.
[214:28.25]Who else?
[214:31.89]Alright, this one, he turns his hand into like a snake.
[214:34.96]He goes... I'll do this one.
[214:38.80]Oops.
[214:39.58]He goes like...
[215:03.53]No, it's just, look at me.
[215:06.01]Look at me.
[215:10.06]The imgur link had a bunch more.
[215:13.10]Okay, so there's that.
[215:15.54]I'm not doing that one.
[215:16.28]I'm not doing the one where the guy puts his dick out.
[215:24.62]What?
[215:25.07]I don't understand.
[215:25.85]Okay, I'll do mu2.
[215:26.95]Alright, mu2 goes like this.
[215:33.06]So like, cross like that.
[216:05.29]So that's mu 2.
[216:10.14]His fingers are different.
[216:11.20]OK, they go down too.
[216:13.18]OK, I'll do it.
[216:44.26]He's getting into it.
[216:45.54]Alright, do the one above Mewtwo.

[227:30.88]That's all I got.
[227:38.95]I think everyone's going to be subbed by the end of this.
[227:41.15]Holy shit, guys.
[227:42.99]I can't keep up with it.
[227:44.25]I don't have any of my stuff here.
[227:46.51]I just have a laptop.
[227:48.86]You guys are fucking amazing, though.
[227:50.32]Thank you.
[227:52.36]Hope you guys had fun, because we're getting down to the end here.
[228:04.47]I look forward to whatever you guys do with this.
[228:10.59]The creativity from this community is second to none.
[228:16.56]I look forward to whatever you guys come up with.
[228:19.88]While there's still a lot of people here, let me talk about this.
[228:23.26]Two weeks from now, in two full weeks, we're going to sit down and we're going to have a movie night.
[228:30.77]So, whatever you do with this footage, whatever you do with it, keep in mind a couple of very important things.
[228:37.74]It has to be at least 10 seconds long.
[228:40.50]So no, like, up, like we talked about, right?
[228:43.68]It's got to be 10 seconds.
[228:44.82]Or up to two minutes.
[228:47.82]Nothing more than that.
[228:48.96]If it's 201, it's out.
[228:53.01]So up to two minutes, at least 10 seconds.
[228:58.70]And these videos are going to be pre-screened.
[229:02.44]So whatever you do with this, keep in mind, if it's going to be shown on this stream, then it's going to be pre-screened.
[229:15.60]So that means all potential bullshit that I don't want obviously shown on stream will be taken care of.
[229:25.10]This is not a contest, by the way.
[229:28.99]This is not a contest.
[229:31.95]It's just for fun.
[229:39.64]I just wanted to do it because it seemed like something fun to do.
[229:43.00]No, it's not a contest.
[229:45.86]But if you want to participate, if you want to use this footage for something, I hope you have fun.
[229:56.49]How about this one?
[229:57.25]A couple more.
[229:57.91]How about this one?
[230:00.79]I'll do like a Michael Jackson.
[230:10.95]I'll do a moonwalk too.
[230:16.42]See, I went backwards.
[230:25.60]I did it all wrong.
[230:26.71]Oh, reenact the dome video.
[230:30.92]woohoo, hey, I'm a gnome, and you... Nope, I'm not doing that.
[230:34.06]I'm not even going to give you a chance.
[230:47.81]No, all I said was, I'm a gnome.
[230:49.13]I didn't say anything else.
[230:58.68]Do Norman Osborn.
[231:05.28]Peter.
[231:08.98]You're a scientist.
[231:11.67]I'm something of a scientist myself.
[231:16.57]You know, I find myself to be something of a scientist myself.
[231:19.43]What?
[231:21.45]Peter, I hear you're quite the scientist.
[231:25.04]Well, I'm something of a scientist myself.
[231:33.34]Get that in a fuckin' petri dish, motherfucker!
[231:53.83]I'm already editing this.
[231:59.24]Oh, somebody said do a fat roll.
[232:00.58]Yeah, I will.
[232:02.54]I'm gonna get hurt.
[232:04.27]I'll do a fat roll with the fucking sword.
[232:06.01]I gotta be a Dark Souls character.
[232:54.82]Here you go.
[233:03.11]Alright guys.
[233:10.49]Dark Souls emotes.
[233:21.51]TF2 taunts.
[233:26.41]Alright, I'll do a scout.
[233:41.06]Hey, you simply keep track of my hands and pat them in.
[233:43.87]Fork!
[233:52.35]Fork!
[234:09.18]Do it again, do it again, do it again.
[234:14.10]Dark Souls emotes, what is it?
[234:15.70]Alright, well, I'll do Praise the Sun.
[234:17.69]Praise the Sun is this, right?
[234:23.05]Right, like up here?
[234:23.99]Am I doing that right?
[234:26.23]You go like up on your tippy toes, right?
[234:56.91]Hey!
[235:00.47]Hey!
[235:09.62]There you go.
[235:11.58]Very good.
[235:18.09]Alright, I did the T-pose.
[235:19.53]I did like 30 minutes of T-pose.
[235:29.73]Oh, I got a... Yeah, I already T-posed.
[235:34.96]Actually, let me do some jumps.
[235:38.73]I know a lot of people are asking for jumps.
[236:04.41]Mario.
[236:10.05]Oh, right, the cereal bowl.
[236:22.63]Where am I?
[236:30.62]What?
[236:30.78]No!
[236:43.00]Don't eat me.
[236:43.44]Don't eat me.
[236:44.04]Don't eat me.
[236:47.34]Oh.
[236:54.78]No.
[236:55.42]No, no.
[236:56.94]No, please.
[236:57.90]Please don't do it.
[237:08.32]That was me in a cereal bowl trying not to get eaten by a toddler eating cereal.
[237:20.16]I did Toy Story earlier.
[237:24.48]Alright.
[237:26.00]I'm going to get out of here.
[237:28.36]I am exhausted.
[237:35.94]I want to make sure I got everything that I wanted to get.
[237:48.63]The race, the scooter, oh my God.
[238:21.53]I don't know how to work this.
[238:27.04]It just like kicks up, right?
[238:29.60]There's some kind of locking mechanism on it.
[238:33.50]Oh, there it goes.
[238:35.56]Just like that.
[238:44.54]This is made for a small person.
[238:49.56]I don't know how to ride this.
[239:24.06]What's up, man?
[239:27.74]Oh, shit.
[239:28.34]Alright, one more.
[239:44.21]I'm gonna do a trick.
[240:18.81]There it is.
[240:34.26]Alright.
[240:40.43]Fine.
[240:40.77]I'll do the narrow toe run.
[240:42.15]Fine.
[241:26.89]Alright.
[241:31.89]Jump from the tree to tree.
[242:05.62]I made it on the ground.
[242:09.93]What do you have to say now?
[242:19.71]Alright.
[242:29.46]Do the spy crab?
[243:00.02]Alright.
[243:04.88]I'll see you guys later.
[243:08.80]I still have to clean up.
[243:14.21]Have fun.
[243:14.63]Good luck.
[243:16.65]Two weeks from now.
[243:18.33]Again.
[243:21.03]In two weeks.
[243:22.69]We're going to watch them.
[243:23.87]I will make sure to let you know.
[243:25.71]The next stream is going to be on Sunday.
[243:27.26]Sunday.
[243:29.46]So nothing tomorrow, Sunday afternoon.
[243:32.62]I will give you all the details.
[243:36.06]A shitload of subs, a shitload of money came in.
[243:37.98]20 subs just came in right now too.
[243:43.24]Jesus Christ.
[243:48.05]You guys spoil the absolute fuck out of me.
[243:51.55]And the next Jerma Rumble, Jermania, on WWE 2K19 is next weekend.
[243:57.93]Probably Sunday or Saturday.
[244:00.91]But... Yeah, I wish I could go through and read everything, but... I only have the studio until... Well, I think I only have it until now, so I've got to get ready to get out of here.
[244:15.08]But...
[244:17.46]This is the space that I'll be doing a lot of stuff from.
[244:22.79]Hope you had fun.
[244:23.49]Hope you get some fun material out of this.
[244:26.19]You've got just about like three to four hours of footage here that you can do whatever the fuck you want with.
[244:34.52]So take care, everybody.
[244:37.98]I'll see you Sunday.
