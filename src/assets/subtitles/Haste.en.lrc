[ve:61.1.100]

[00:22.20]What is happening?
[00:23.44]Good morning to none of you.
[00:26.87]Good afternoon to some of you.
[00:29.13]Good evening to some of you.
[00:32.13]We're here for another live stream.
[00:35.62]Me chilling out, hanging out.
[00:44.38]Uh...
[00:45.95]Starting a little bit early.
[00:47.37]I want to give a little time playing this game before we do Marvel Rivals.
[00:52.11]I'm going to do Rivals for a couple hours.
[00:56.30]And then, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to announce that we will be playing Chrono Trigger for at least a couple hours at the end of today's stream.
[01:15.06]It will happen today.
[01:24.50]But we're going to get rid of the pre-rolls.
[01:26.14]We'll get into haste.
[01:27.18]I want to play haste for like an hour.
[01:30.02]Marvel Rivals around two-ish.
[01:31.65]I think we're going to be joined by Ster during Marvel Rivals.
[01:37.13]So play with one of the boys.
[01:43.23]And then Chrono Trigger.
[01:45.29]I'll be back in a few minutes.
[01:47.00]Get yourself ready.
[01:48.95]See you soon.
[03:05.23]We're still waiting for that to start.
[03:06.46]Yeah, because haste is.
[03:10.44]This is a game where you run really fast.
[03:16.20]It's like a high score kind of game.
[03:24.03]Ster recommended.
[03:25.31]Yeah, I've seen a lot of people play it too.
[03:28.53]Seems like it's pretty fun.
[03:35.64]It's fun to watch haste gameplay.
[03:39.17]I can't assure you that my haste gameplay... Wait, is this a controller game or is this... Keyboard, mouse.
[03:45.91]Probably controller, right?
[03:54.16]Keyboard?
[03:56.72]I feel like I would want to do controller.
[03:58.60]Third person games are always controller for me.
[04:00.54]Almost always.
[04:08.42]Keyboard is fine.
[04:10.72]I'll try it with controller and if it sucks, I'll go to keyboard.
[04:22.17]Try keyboard first.
[04:23.47]Controller is for normies.
[04:24.71]You're going to play Marvel Rivals with a controller?
[04:29.65]No.
[04:32.15]Yeah, that's a third person game, but.
[04:35.41]I'm not going to do that with a controller.
[04:42.70]I don't know, dude.
[04:43.22]You should just drink some more milk.
[04:47.29]I don't really drink milk.
[04:57.30]I have a milk voice right now.
[04:58.62]Are we going to see the lava lamp today?
[05:06.06]No, there's not going to be a camp today.
[05:10.83]Which is gaming today.
[05:12.51]For the most part.
[05:14.39]Like I said, the cam is going to be a... You know, it's going to be not that often.
[05:22.65]It'll be sometimes.
[05:31.02]Yeah, I don't know what's going on with the dead pixel.
[05:33.46]I think that's on the camera.
[05:42.59]Sometimes is good.
[05:43.49]Yeah, I prefer it that way, honestly.
[05:46.13]More fun that way for me.
[05:50.51]I would love the ads to start.
[05:51.79]I can't even run them.
[05:59.83]Okay, well... I think I'm just going to start.
[06:03.69]I might get cut off here, but...
[06:06.56]I did leave some feedback with Twitch about this, by the way.
[06:10.32]I left some feedback about this very issue.
[06:19.95]I... I... Karen, I kind of... I kind of left some feedback.
[06:26.93]I typed... I was typing and I was like, let me tell you something.
[06:30.40]First of all, it was about... it was two paragraphs.
[06:33.50]It was...
[06:37.14]Uh, I'm probably going to get cut off, but... This is a rare... A rarity, I would say.
[06:50.37]Okay, now it says that they're starting... Okay, there they go.
[06:55.65]Every time I talk about it, it's like, is somebody listening?
[07:01.27]I'll do the settings while we're waiting around.
[07:13.30]Let's get the volume up.
[07:14.58]Alright, I got controller in my hand.
[07:18.91]Let's see, alright.
[07:19.61]I kind of messed around with it a little bit.
[07:23.41]I got DLSS on.
[07:26.71]Anything on here that needs to go away?
[07:29.47]Difficulty.
[07:30.75]Medium?
[07:31.35]I'll keep it on medium, that's fine.
[07:33.85]Music volume.
[07:34.66]I think the volume's fine.
[07:38.96]So this is a speedrun game?
[07:43.23]Like a legit speedrun, speedrun game.
[07:45.23]Okay, dive is A in right trigger.
[07:48.03]Fast run is L. Interact is A. I'm sure I'll get a tutorial.
[07:55.08]Can we choose your settings?
[07:56.90]No, you cannot.
[07:57.76]Absolutely not.
[08:07.91]Let's see.
[08:14.40]Opening up a portal.
[08:19.02]Graphics are pretty good.
[08:21.56]It's kind of buttery.
[08:22.22]Okay.
[08:33.80]I just swallowed a whole ice cube.
[08:39.73]That sucked.
[08:47.05]This is really buttery.
[08:49.57]I guess it kind of has to be, doesn't it?
[08:50.83]OK.
[09:05.86]So you have to run and not run into shit.
[09:11.96]I hear this is very good.
[09:12.92]I hear this is like one of the better games that have come out this year.
[09:22.80]And I don't think those people are full of shit.
[09:30.83]Okay.
[09:43.51]Alright, my turn.
[09:55.82]Alright, everyone should be back now.
[09:58.58]You didn't really miss much.
[09:59.34]We were just running around.
[10:01.46]We went through a portal.
[10:03.21]And now it's time for me to run through.
[10:04.91]Alright, let's go.
[10:07.37]Left stick.
[10:08.15]Fast fall and start running.
[10:11.87]It's just run.
[10:16.45]Everything's falling apart.
[10:17.48]Run!
[10:17.74]I finally found you.
[10:19.62]You have to find the portal out of here.
[10:21.92]But who are you?
[10:23.32]We'll talk later.
[10:23.90]For now, just run and leap.
[10:26.93]Okay, how do I leap?
[10:30.77]Left stick press to go fast.
[10:34.41]Okay, perform perfect landings by landing... Okay, it's just like that old Flash game where you had to land on the divot.
[10:44.16]I used to get a huge high score doing this, by the way.
[10:51.96]Tiny wings, that's the one.
[10:52.94]Alright, so you gotta jump.
[10:55.15]How do I jump?
[10:58.45]Like that.
[10:58.79]Alright, so there is no jump.
[11:05.47]Not bad.
[11:09.29]That was pretty bad.
[11:15.25]Shit.
[11:15.67]Alright.
[11:21.55]Oops.
[11:22.21]I fucked up the tutorial.
[11:23.06]It's fine.
[11:24.20]My hand got fucked up.
[11:27.85]I'm just trying to see how, uh, how it works.
[11:38.09]So you really want to start like there.
[11:39.61]Okay.
[11:42.02]Ster is probably watching right now.
[11:43.34]Just laughing.
[11:43.98]He probably spit his fucking dinner out.
[11:45.62]There we go.
[11:50.94]There we go.
[11:56.09]Alright.
[11:56.51]I got it.
[11:58.49]Alright, usability to gain speed.
[12:01.37]The world is collapsing.
[12:02.07]You have to leave while you still can.
[12:04.23]Actually, every world is collapsing.
[12:06.25]What?
[12:06.99]It's not really looking good, but maybe we can find a place that's more stable than this.
[12:10.33]Your board should help you reach the portal.
[12:12.84]My board.
[12:14.00]Just do good landings to build up energy.
[12:15.92]And then use your board whenever I need a burst of speed.
[12:19.66]Go.
[12:21.72]Okay.
[12:25.46]So you want to land...
[12:28.49]Okay.
[12:29.59]Doing perfect landings gives you energy.
[12:31.43]Ability is... I'm sorry, I'm looking over... I'm looking over on the left side of the screen.
[12:35.60]I don't know what the fuck just happened.
[12:37.96]I'm trying to see what usability is left trigger.
[12:40.34]I gotta take my eyes off the screen!
[12:59.45]Oh shit, we're going fast now.
[13:07.94]Wait, what?
[13:09.08]What am I doing?
[13:12.92]Hold on a second.
[13:15.68]Why did it rewind me?
[13:20.94]It said use the board for extra speed.
[13:22.34]Do I have to land in the... Okay, I'm doing the tutorial.
[13:26.67]I have to land.
[13:27.57]I can't do the speed boost thing yet.
[13:41.78]He's going to write this down in stuff to play later list.
[13:44.84]No, this is cool.
[13:47.78]The Xbox controller is bugged.
[13:49.24]You need to use mouse and keyboard.
[13:50.62]What?
[13:51.66]Is that, are you serious?
[13:57.85]Okay.
[14:00.15]I'm just skipping everything.
[14:00.89]I'm sorry.
[14:04.55]I know about Zoe, but I don't know much about this place.
[14:08.61]Why are the worlds collapsing?
[14:11.15]I don't know.
[14:11.69]I only know you need to find a shard.
[14:14.65]Okay.
[14:19.54]On somewhere it would be towards that thing.
[14:21.18]We got to go look for her.
[14:25.76]You need to find the currently active shard.
[14:27.50]It is indicated by a glow that's visible from far away.
[14:31.17]If you can't see it, try running to a different position.
[14:33.63]Okay.
[14:35.07]I got to go find a shard.
[14:38.53]That looks like a big glowing shard, doesn't it?
[14:48.91]head on it.
[14:50.47]Wait, what?
[14:53.73]What happened?
[14:54.33]I didn't enter it?
[14:56.77]Run straight into the shard to start your first shard run.
[15:03.66]Is that not what I did?
[15:04.44]Oh, I have to run into a specific spot.
[15:14.72]Okay, I get it.
[15:35.18]Shit, I gotta... I gotta go faster?
[15:53.39]Oh my god, I'm going too fast.
[16:09.56]Is that worth a shard?
[16:10.28]I got a B. I got a B. I'm doing fine.
[16:17.70]Fragments.
[16:18.20]A shard run consists of fragments and you choose your path through to the end.
[16:22.89]If you choose a fragment multiple fragments away.
[16:24.53]So wait, is this kind of like play the spire?
[16:30.27]If you choose a fragment multiple fragments away, you will automatically play through all the fragments up to that destination.
[16:35.35]Okay.
[16:37.13]Let's do this one.
[16:41.92]Zoe finds Dara relaxing on a tree branch, despite the world around her being completely unstable.
[16:46.96]She's in no hurry, since she has already found a portal out.
[16:50.85]There is no choice but to cross, okay?
[16:52.69]It's right on the other side of that bottomless chasm.
[16:56.07]Alright, let's do it.
[16:56.87]I have one minute.
[17:07.81]Where the fuck am I supposed to go?
[17:17.41]I'm just flying around.
[17:21.43]I have to find the portal?
[17:23.13]Okay.
[17:24.81]Ow!
[17:27.59]Where the fuck is it?
[17:28.35]Okay, I failed.
[17:39.44]It was straight across?
[17:42.86]I guess I failed it.
[17:51.01]Okay, well the tutorial was I was running in a straight line.
[17:52.97]I get it though.
[18:03.58]I get why this is really fun.
[18:26.88]See me go through the trees there?
[18:33.36]Is there a jump?
[18:34.40]Or do I have to get up off the hills?
[18:45.27]Aim with your right stick?
[18:47.55]It's only momentum.
[18:48.53]Okay, cool.
[18:50.65]Are these like boss fights?
[18:51.51]I don't know what this is.
[19:03.33]What do we have here?
[19:03.97]I'm Zoe.
[19:05.18]Who are you?
[19:06.56]Wait now one second.
[19:07.63]Aren't you the letter girl?
[19:08.67]I am.
[19:13.10]Well, I was.
[19:15.24]I believe you bought me many letters of love and admiration from other worlds.
[19:18.59]I don't think I remember all the people I... My crew and I would arrive in towns where you delivered, ready to collect praise and tributes.
[19:25.49]We may not have met in person, but I know your work, and of course you've heard of me.
[19:29.23]Yes, who are you?
[19:31.05]You must have heard of the Captain.
[19:33.77]Uh, Captain what?
[19:35.47]Not need to be so formal among friends.
[19:36.85]Simply Captain Will Do or The Captain.
[19:39.81]Preferably My Captain.
[19:42.57]Where's my friend?
[19:43.59]She's tall, strong, and very fast.
[19:45.47]Even faster than she used to be.
[19:46.67]That's definitely her.
[19:49.63]I don't know.
[19:50.31]But, goodbye.
[19:50.73]Who was that?
[19:51.25]Okay.
[19:51.85]What do I do now?
[20:13.10]Is that your self insert character?
[20:19.90]I guess it's like a, like a chance meeting.
[20:30.53]I think I'm gonna do this route here.
[20:32.65]I want another, um, so does it just string them together?
[21:21.66]Up and over the hill right here.
[21:29.81]Shit, I had it.
[21:42.53]I missed the coins, but it's alright.
[21:46.61]See?
[21:54.49]Are we in the lapdog era of streams now?
[21:56.65]It's whatever era I fucking say it is.
[22:26.71]I need to get more air.
[22:29.49]Don't go in there.
[22:30.07]Oh my god.
[22:36.71]Like Sonic?
[22:37.15]It is like Sonic.
[22:37.98]It's kind of... It's like Sonic and... Flappy Wings.
[22:42.80]Whatever that game.
[22:43.28]It's like those two are together.
[22:45.54]They made a game.
[22:46.74]You put like... You put them into a... Hold on.
[22:54.83]Oh, that feels good.
[23:02.72]That's gotta be better than a C, right?
[23:04.80]Fucking God.
[23:05.94]How do you get better than a C?
[23:08.76]It's kind of like subway surfers.
[23:10.00]Yeah.
[23:13.05]Okay.
[23:13.81]Sarah was supposedly quite adept at keeping airborne in her youth.
[23:18.15]Skills she is more than eager to pass on.
[23:20.53]However, after repeatedly crashing to the grounds, Zoe has become less and less certain she is the right person to pass it on.
[23:26.05]May your arms be wings.
[23:30.24]Keep working at it?
[23:32.62]Oh, minus 10% gravity.
[23:36.90]Should I do this?
[23:43.31]So, I'm just... I'll do it.
[23:46.01]Okay.
[23:50.82]So, gravity is... Alright, what does this one mean?
[23:56.80]I'll find out.
[23:59.90]You're 40.
[24:00.10]I don't think you're going to get above a C on this game.
[24:04.01]Watch this.
[24:49.55]Oh, that scared the fuck out of me!
[24:50.81]It's almost like I got hit in real life.
[25:01.97]That felt like I got hit in real life.
[25:05.83]Oh shit!
[25:06.63]Alright, I deserve a C for that one, but... Oh my god.
[25:12.42]That's not an F. I'm not gonna get Luigi'd, I'm fine.
[25:32.59]Oh man.
[25:35.78]I can see how somebody could obsessively play this game for like 5 million hours.
[25:41.94]And 100% every track and it's fun.
[25:46.60]I get it.
[26:00.52]I gotta hit the inclines way harder.
[26:14.68]Hey, gonna get a C on that one.
[26:21.26]You can have the difficulty increase forever with a mod.
[26:36.85]Trying to find the right incline right here.
[26:52.90]The thing is my brain kind of operates on an old eight.
[26:56.40]I don't have a solid state drive.
[26:59.26]I got a really good hard disk drive, but it's still a hard disk drive.
[27:08.83]Whenever I see information, it takes me like a like a half of a millisecond to process it, not instantly.
[27:21.33]I don't have an SSD in my brain.
[27:22.55]No way.
[27:24.27]Some of you guys are operating on like, you know, a cup of coffee puts you in an SSD.
[27:27.25]No way.
[27:28.41]Not for me.
[27:38.84]I like watching people that have solid state drives do this.
[27:47.85]Western Digital.
[27:48.87]Yeah, hey, Western Digital Black.
[27:59.24]Do you guys remember they used to sell though?
[28:01.00]There was always so much.
[28:02.04]I feel like OK, that was a guy got pretty bad shit apparently.
[28:11.92]10% boost.
[28:15.66]Floppy disk brain.
[28:26.71]That's kind of good.
[28:28.95]That's good too.
[28:30.69]I'll take this one.
[28:35.03]Get to safety.
[28:36.33]I'm looking for you.
[28:37.27]Darren and I are looking for you.
[28:39.61]Don't.
[28:40.79]Wait.
[28:44.86]I'm probably going to die to the boss, but I'm going to go here.
[28:48.96]I feel like this is like an item shop or something.
[29:22.23]I gotta fly way higher.
[29:24.71]But I'm gonna do it.
[29:25.31]I'm alright.
[29:52.90]That looked good.
[29:59.44]Right there.
[30:00.96]Yes.
[30:06.69]Alright, that had to have been better than a C. What?
[30:11.97]I feel like that was pretty good.
[30:13.05]That was a C?
[30:18.03]Still too slow?
[30:18.99]Okay.
[30:22.94]How did I get a B the first time?
[30:23.98]I have no idea.
[30:24.60]Okay, you called for me.
[30:28.08]Indeed.
[30:28.62]You're still looking for your friend, are you not?
[30:31.30]Yes, have you seen her?
[30:33.04]I have found her.
[30:33.84]I even raced her.
[30:35.28]It did not go as planned.
[30:36.48]My shoes were a little loose and my cape got caught on something.
[30:39.94]I get it, yeah.
[30:41.88]I know how it is, man.
[30:43.54]I get it.
[30:43.82]She's extremely fast.
[30:47.26]But my shoes were not on tight enough.
[30:48.78]It's fine.
[30:51.27]I will help you find her so that I can race her again.
[30:52.87]So wait, you have to race against somebody?
[30:54.17]That's the boss?
[30:54.67]That's kind of cool.
[30:57.03]Okay.
[30:57.77]Keep doing what I was doing.
[30:58.97]Happy I could help.
[30:59.75]Farewell.
[31:03.61]Holding dive isn't fully the best thing.
[31:05.23]Holding the dive fully isn't the best thing to do always.
[31:08.03]I'm starting to realize that.
[31:11.18]Oh, hi there.
[31:11.74]This is unexpected.
[31:13.66]Hello, I'm Zoe.
[31:15.88]Dalil.
[31:17.38]He's introducing himself.
[31:18.34]He's Dalil.
[31:19.82]Hmm, you coming through that portal blew out some of my measuring equipment.
[31:23.68]I'm so sorry.
[31:24.20]I didn't mean to.
[31:25.43]Oh, don't overthink it.
[31:26.81]I had clearly miscalibrated.
[31:28.47]Let's see.
[31:31.97]Who are you?
[31:32.47]I'm fine.
[31:34.05]I'm Gan, and you already seem to have my partner Dalil on your side.
[31:38.09]We have our little research station out here trying to figure out what's going on.
[31:42.24]yeah you're right she came through the portal if you come across little glowing crystals the Sparks you call them Sparks we call them deli yes Sparks is better a lot better alright so this is what like a shop alright what can I buy I have 2400 I need your help with an experiment okay
[32:10.50]With enough Sparks, I could get them here.
[32:12.40]Teleport them in.
[32:13.74]Manifestation.
[32:14.28]I'm not sure any of these things actually exist.
[32:16.85]Isn't it dangerous?
[32:17.77]Okay.
[32:26.76]I kind of want the slow time.
[32:38.38]Five seconds?
[32:40.08]I feel like that's huge.
[32:43.16]Is there more stuff?
[32:47.54]Oh, no.
[32:49.08]Don't touch that.
[32:50.20]It's been tuned perfectly after weeks of experiments.
[32:52.29]It's crucial to my work.
[32:54.71]It's a coffee machine.
[32:55.49]Do they have coffee in your world?
[32:59.53]I just run between them delivering letters.
[33:03.43]You used to pass between worlds before all this happened.
[33:05.72]Yes.
[33:06.68]But the wisest woman I know said she doesn't think this is all my fault.
[33:12.27]Might explain why your equipment blew out, though.
[33:14.17]What did I even touch?
[33:16.59]Sometimes packages.
[33:17.47]That's fascinating.
[33:18.33]Why?
[33:19.49]Why did I do that?
[33:21.33]Were you working for someone?
[33:22.58]No, it was just me.
[33:23.54]I couldn't actually control when I went to another world.
[33:28.16]Not like now.
[33:28.76]There's just an open pathway.
[33:30.92]You were forcibly displaced from world to world.
[33:34.65]Just jumping around different worlds.
[33:37.77]Okay.
[33:40.13]Incredible.
[33:40.63]Alright, so I'm not going to touch this shit.
[33:44.79]Here we go.
[33:46.43]I want this thing.
[33:46.95]Alright, so activate item slow time.
[33:55.13]Seems like something we should test in practice.
[33:56.71]Okay.
[34:00.23]Okay.
[34:02.74]Well, you got mad when I just touched the thing over there.
[34:05.74]I can have coffee now?
[34:10.20]Run into us again soon.
[34:11.13]Okay.
[34:16.17]So acquired items can be inspected in the item view.
[34:20.35]Yeah.
[34:23.55]Alright.
[34:26.54]Okay.
[34:27.58]I guess we could do it like this.
[34:32.11]Does that replace the, the boogie board that I have?
[34:40.76]Oh, it does not.
[34:41.38]Okay.
[34:44.78]Alright.
[34:45.02]Time to get, time to get fucked up by the boss.
[34:50.49]I only have 10 health.
[34:51.39]Am I going to make it through one run?
[34:58.75]New character?
[34:59.59]Oh no, same character.
[35:01.71]Do you know what your home world was?
[35:04.21]No, I've been running for as long as I remember.
[35:07.50]Maybe in some ways that's easier rather than carrying the pain of what has been long lost.
[35:14.80]So what do I get for doing this?
[35:17.30]It's just kind of like a little breaker.
[35:20.22]Is it a heal?
[35:20.76]Because I have full health now.
[35:25.74]Alright, here we go.
[35:31.91]Battle begins in 321.
[35:37.21]Attack the machine.
[35:38.29]How do that?
[35:43.84]Oh my God, that hurts.
[35:59.88]Cool.
[36:06.55]Yikes.
[36:19.62]Oh, fuck.
[36:22.19]OK, come on.
[36:27.81]So you have to avoid the blasts too.
[36:37.85]I'm going to stop shit.
[36:55.14]God damn it.
[37:02.84]Trying to sneak through the fire is so hard.
[37:07.36]I'm not ready for this.
[37:08.50]I'm going to lose.
[37:09.82]I'm not ready for this.
[37:10.42]Right in the head.
[37:32.10]Alright, that was good.
[37:33.00]Got to do it four times.
[37:39.16]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[37:40.80]How did I hit that tree?
[37:52.97]I don't understand how to get over that wall.
[38:00.38]Where even is he?
[38:02.74]What the fuck, man?
[38:19.03]I'm dead.
[38:21.44]Thank god I landed that perfect.
[38:22.44]Okay.
[38:29.27]This is bad though.
[38:36.15]Come on!
[38:37.12]I can do it.
[39:03.61]Alright, I get it.
[39:04.17]Fuck.
[39:10.17]Alright, I unlocked a few items.
[39:11.29]Got a... Alright, that was the first run ever.
[39:13.71]That was fun.
[39:21.38]That didn't go well.
[39:23.12]On the contrary, you made it back.
[39:24.46]I figured there was a good chance neither of us would see another sunrise.
[39:30.36]I didn't manage to convince her to come with me.
[39:34.58]Wait, what?
[39:34.98]I didn't mean to... Wait.
[39:38.71]Okay, you can gain anti-Sparks from shard runs.
[39:40.91]Spend anti-Sparks on permanent upgrades.
[39:42.59]Ah, okay.
[39:43.17]Your jump is 5% higher.
[39:43.67]Your speed is 10% faster.
[39:44.17]Uh-huh, I get it.
[40:07.28]I get it Alright, so let's see what uh anti-Sparks With the Infinity Nikki fashion stream you promised I did Hey, it's still it's still uh, it's still being worked out

[41:26.15]Alright, let me try that again.
[41:38.98]I think I got time for another run.
[41:48.98]I was looking at chat, sorry.
[41:49.78]Do you play Hades?
[41:53.84]I beat the, I guess, base game of Hades on stream.
[41:57.59]Hades 1.
[42:05.51]Let me try this again.
[42:08.25]I might not have time to do a full run.
[42:09.91]We'll see.
[42:11.84]I'm gonna give Ster a call here soon.
[42:16.52]Ow, really?
[42:21.26]I thought that was like past it.
[42:28.57]Dude, I'm this game is going to make me irrationally angry.
[42:31.91]This is one of those games where it just makes you so angry.
[42:37.85]You clip on a wall or you get hit by something and you just like your teeth just fucking clench.
[42:57.22]I get it though.
[43:00.21]I can see others.
[43:00.91]Yeah, I mean, I don't say the same thing five times, but you know what I mean?
[43:05.39]Let's go straight up here.
[43:11.28]You're playing this is making me irrationally angry.
[43:13.61]Bro, I loaded the game up 30 minutes ago.
[43:19.06]Will you just relax?
[43:40.42]I like the music too.
[43:41.60]Music's good.
[43:52.58]Super speed.
[44:02.39]B. That's a B. That's a B if I've ever seen one.
[44:05.73]Oh!
[44:06.93]He's never gonna get an S!
[44:07.95]He's always gonna get a C!
[44:09.13]He sucks!
[44:41.92]Shit.
[44:42.34]Bad.
[44:45.58]The momentum's all fucked now.
[44:59.79]Ah!
[45:00.95]That's not a good one, but it's alright.
[45:06.00]Hey!
[45:07.24]I'll take it.
[45:07.84]I'll take it.
[45:13.47]What do you got?
[45:16.47]I just won't get hit.
[45:18.51]50% energy.
[45:20.07]Max health is kind of crazy.
[45:21.31]Alright, cool.
[45:26.46]Hell yeah.
[45:29.84]Alright, I'm starting to get addicted to this game.
[45:31.24]I actually really like it.
[45:35.29]Go with that right side.
[45:37.23]I want the health.
[45:43.81]No, he likes it.
[45:45.09]No way you don't.
[45:45.89]You want me to not like the game, why?
[45:47.55]It all falls apart now.
[46:17.22]Oh, this is bad.
[46:21.48]This is bad.
[46:28.58]I tried to be sneaky with it and I just fucked up everything.
[46:30.96]That's GG.
[46:38.25]Oh well.
[47:01.39]bad.
[47:02.38]That was bad.
[47:02.94]Sorry.
[47:36.02]That's after.
[47:40.57]Ah fuck.
[47:48.07]Just smushed my elbow.
[48:01.93]Way too much, but I'm I got a lot of speed though.
[48:09.84]Don't hit a tree.
[48:28.79]Alright, so when I first started playing, I was treating this like that bird game.
[48:32.70]I was trying to dive down into the...
[48:36.65]into the hills, but you don't have to do that.
[48:38.43]You just, you glide around, glide around.
[48:40.89]Okay, get my health, my refill.
[48:49.64]Oh, I found you.
[48:52.64]Niada, you shouldn't be out here.
[48:55.36]I'll fix this.
[48:56.58]What do you mean?
[48:57.49]The universe is falling apart and you'll fix it?
[49:01.07]Come with me, Endaro.
[49:03.75]I have to go.
[49:05.11]No, please come find us.
[49:14.41]I'll go up this way.
[49:17.17]I have to beat the boss.
[49:18.47]I have to.
[49:18.81]1% energy.
[49:24.39]Gain 1% energy on spark pickup.
[49:30.07]That kind of sounds cool.
[49:32.78]On close call, restore three health.
[49:34.36]Yep.
[49:34.56]I feel like I have those happen all the time.
[49:49.74]I'm going to give our friend Ster a call here in a second.
[49:53.33]Got about five, ten minutes or so.
[49:55.89]I could beat the boss in ten minutes.
[50:12.29]Damn it.
[50:25.76]Good.
[50:26.06]That was better than good.
[50:27.52]Eh.
[50:49.56]Aren't those three the same thing?
[50:50.56]Alright
[51:25.79]Sick.
[51:34.47]Oh my goodness.
[51:35.74]What the hell is this in the way?
[51:38.24]This one's way too hard.
[51:42.06]This one was too hard.
[51:42.70]I just failed.
[51:46.08]There was a fucking structure in the way.
[51:49.26]And now I'm getting Fortnite-ed.
[51:50.82]I'm dead.
[52:02.24]I gotta get started on the call anyways.
[52:03.76]What time is it?
[52:06.94]It's supposed to start at 2 o'clock.
[52:10.62]Look at this big ass structure.
[52:11.88]I looked over at chat and I took a right.
[52:18.17]Okay, if I paid more attention I'd be fine.
[52:21.93]I'm like preparing the sponsor segment of the stream.
[52:25.95]At the same time of playing the Sonic the Hedgehog run game.
[52:32.61]I'm multitasking.
[52:33.55]Look at me.
[52:33.83]I'm moving everywhere.
[52:34.74]It's like I got four arms.
[52:38.41]This one is crazy though.
[53:01.75]I barely got through that one.
[53:05.32]I had to D whatever it's fine.
[53:07.32]Let me give Ster a call.
[53:10.38]Alright, let's hope you guys can hear Ster because I did a bunch of audio setting changes.
[53:19.55]If you don't, then I'm going to have to put him through the main speaker.
[53:23.61]Let's see.
[53:28.67]Yo.
[53:31.34]I'm starting in a minute or two.
[53:35.58]What's up with you?
[53:39.32]How are you doing?
[53:49.09]You think I can kill a boss in two minutes?
[53:59.59]I didn't even buy an item.
[54:00.99]Alright, Ster is good for it.
[54:05.91]Hold on, let me call Ster.
[54:12.75]I hope that you can hear him.
[54:14.98]We will find out.
[54:19.68]I did test it.
[54:20.82]I did a stream recording.
[54:22.00]Let's find out.
[54:31.81]See if we hear him.
[54:41.29]He didn't answer.
[54:43.24]Why did he not answer my phone call?
[54:54.17]He said call me whenever.
[54:56.27]Then he didn't answer.
[54:59.99]Hey, can you guys hear him?
[55:04.40]They're gonna lie to you either way.
[55:09.54]Yes, they can hear you.
[55:11.88]Yeah, sick.
[55:14.52]I'm playing your favorite game.
[55:18.46]Yes.
[55:19.66]I heard you were very self conscious about me judging you and I wasn't even there.
[55:25.28]Well, no, I just was saying that this is like one of your games that you like.
[55:28.26]I was getting minute-by-minute updates.
[55:33.08]People holding newsroom.
[55:34.72]They're handing in photos like, run this story.
[55:36.55]Come on, run this story.
[55:37.57]No, no, no.
[55:39.67]Hey, I just started playing.
[55:41.03]No, no, I got you.
[55:41.99]I got you.
[55:43.01]Dude, I just started playing.
[55:44.29]People already were making fun of me for being bad at the game, and I just started like 10 minutes ago.
[55:48.29]You need there's a steam workshop for it.
[55:51.15]You need the Peter Griffin.
[55:52.79]There's a Peter Griffin.
[55:54.39]Yeah, you need that and then everyone will just will not notice anything else.
[55:59.51]People said I was bad at it, but then I showed them and I got an S. Uh, you should be better now.
[56:06.69]Let's see.
[56:10.33]Uh, say they say your ABC's ABCDEFG.
[56:15.40]We can hear you perfectly fine now.
[56:18.68]Alright, so I'm going to lose to this boss, and then we're going to move to Marvel Rivals.
[56:24.76]Okay.
[56:25.90]I'll watch and judge for real now.
[56:27.61]Judge me for real.
[56:40.93]The boss isn't even this way.
[56:42.35]The boss isn't...
[56:45.63]Alright, we're going to move on to Marvel.
[56:47.37]It's a good thing.
[56:48.05]No, I didn't even watch.
[56:50.01]I just I see where you're paused.
[56:51.95]I don't know what happened.
[56:54.70]What happened?
[56:55.44]I don't get it.
[56:56.16]Now people can make fun of me.
[56:56.90]You got another life.
[56:57.46]You have to go again.
[56:58.30]No, I can't.
[57:01.40]You're going to die in 30 seconds.
[57:02.58]It's fine.
[57:03.16]Fine, fine, fine.
[57:04.06]Alright, alright, alright.
[57:06.86]When's the next time you're going to get to this boss?
[57:09.94]That's true.
[57:15.56]OK, OK, perfect.
[57:17.14]Thank you.
[57:17.82]Thank you.
[57:20.62]You screened my ear.
[57:22.74]Good stuff.
[57:26.89]OK, oh boom.
[57:33.91]You see that pivot right there?
[57:38.07]Wild.
[57:42.13]Astonishing.
[57:43.99]Brilliant.
[57:47.07]What do I do about that?
[57:47.77]What do I do about that?
[57:48.75]Honestly, what do I do about that?
[57:52.55]You be prepared for it.
[57:53.79]You got to get up in the air.
[57:56.63]Now it's all fucked up.
[58:04.24]Did I take too long?
[58:08.20]I didn't know that could happen.
[58:09.98]I'm talking to you.
[58:11.84]I'm getting the sponsorship ready.
[58:13.30]I'm looking over here.
[58:14.18]I'm looking over there.
[58:14.88]How much brain power does someone need to talk to Ster?
[58:17.38]No, it's just... Say like, say like, goo goo ga ga, dipey dipey, and I'll be entertained.
[58:22.46]Dude, I don't fucking get it.
[58:25.96]This game is hard, alright?
[58:27.22]Everyone comes in here talking all this shit.
[58:28.84]It's like, hey, the game is fucking not easy.
[58:31.84]And now you're inside my head.
[58:35.86]I'm going the wrong way.
[58:37.16]If I were in your head and I were mind controlling you, you'd have killed the boss by now.
[58:43.96]That's not what it is.
[58:44.76]Bad, bad landing.
[58:46.58]No, I'm out of here.
[58:48.85]I'm not even doing it.
[58:50.81]Come on.
[58:56.25]Well, I'm glad you liked haste.
[58:57.75]I'm glad you had a fun time.
[58:58.83]No, I do like it.
[59:00.21]I genuinely think it's a great game.
[59:01.74]I love it.
[59:04.31]Once you get in that, the flow state.
[59:06.77]No, it is.
[59:07.77]I genuinely think it's great.
[59:13.70]Okay.
[59:15.36]So I got to turn ads off.
[59:22.54]Let me turn ads.
[59:23.68]Let me turn them off.
[59:24.40]Can I turn them off like for now?
[59:27.76]Get them off.
