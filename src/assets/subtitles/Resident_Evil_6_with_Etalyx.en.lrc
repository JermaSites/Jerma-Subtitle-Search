[ve:60.16.100]

[00:06.09]Hello.
[00:06.55]How you doing?
[00:11.27]We do have a lot of new emotes.
[00:12.67]You're right.
[00:13.31]What's up?
[00:18.85]Let's go already.
[00:19.67]It's been... I'm not late.
[00:21.27]I was here at 3.30.
[00:21.85]Just like this I said.
[00:25.59]I said Resident Evil 6 is a banger.
[00:26.93]Resident Evil 6 is the worst Resident Evil game.
[00:29.95]Wait, hold on.
[00:31.84]Worst numbered Resident Evil game, I think.
[00:34.84]Wait, hold on.
[00:36.46]It might be better than the first one.
[00:39.82]I know everybody, look, I don't like the tank controls.
[00:42.78]20 years ago, I didn't like tank controls.
[00:45.60]It automatically is like in a different category for me.
[00:55.01]Resident Evil, yeah.
[00:57.54]They're all good.
[00:59.84]Hand controls, I... It just ruins it for me.
[01:05.74]It ruins it.
[01:08.30]It just does.
[01:13.26]Anyways, we've got some stuff to talk about.
[01:15.16]We've got some exciting things to talk about.
[01:16.76]Well, I mean, kind of exciting.
[01:19.99]First most important thing is tonight is the night...
[01:25.53]Where the New Year's Eve nomination categories are going up.
[01:32.27]You'll be able to nominate for each category.
[01:34.39]Make sure you follow the rules.
[01:35.31]They're going to be very, very clearly posted.
[01:36.91]I'm going to give you guys probably 10 days, 12 days to nominate stuff.
[01:46.88]And a day after the nominations close, I'm going to go through.
[01:52.00]Make the list, and you'll be able to vote on the worst and best stings of the year.
[01:57.26]Really important to note.
[01:59.46]Very important.
[02:01.70]The Dollhouse is not nominatable in a handful of categories.
[02:09.38]So, to make it so Dollhouse doesn't, like, inhale ten different categories.
[02:17.70]It is not eligible for Best Dream of the Year.
[02:21.52]It's not eligible for best joke taking more than five minutes to set up because I know a lot of people probably nominate stuff for that.
[02:29.41]So just imagine Dollhouse is grayed out in its own world and there's a new category that's best Dollhouse moment.
[02:36.64]So Dollhouse has its own category.
[02:38.42]You're probably also probably wondering if Worst Peter's on there.
[02:43.78]Of course it is.
[02:45.26]I don't think I said it once.
[02:46.12]I think that's the only time I said it the whole year.
[02:50.22]Is this on there?
[02:50.70]It has to be on there.
[02:51.80]I don't even care.
[02:58.37]Yeah, there's one right there.
[02:59.53]I don't know.
[03:02.17]I was going to take it off, but I was like, you know what?
[03:04.05]I don't care.
[03:10.20]Wait.
[03:10.44]Oh, I got to make sure I didn't get kicked in the lobby, which I may have.
[03:16.80]We kicked.
[03:17.94]No, he's here.
[03:18.98]Just making sure that he wasn't kicked.
[03:21.66]You gotta move around a little bit.
[03:22.76]Okay, currently, me and Etalyx are currently in Resident Evil 6.
[03:27.00]We're in a lobby.
[03:28.02]We're gonna play.
[03:29.66]This is the Resident Evil 6 stream that I've been literally, like, just putting off and just not doing for, like, the last three weeks.
[03:37.06]Three and a half, four weeks.
[03:39.38]Here we are.
[03:39.74]Good question.
[03:41.68]When is tomorrow's stream?
[03:42.80]Oh, no.
[03:43.24]When is Toontown's stream?
[03:45.30]I don't know.
[03:47.20]But would you like to hear the series of events that is going to be pretty exciting stuff?
[03:53.00]Today we're playing Resident Evil 6.
[03:55.14]Never going to play this again.
[03:56.28]I would assume after like three or four hours, maybe five hours tops, I'm just like, I fucking have to leave.
[04:03.00]I don't want to play this anymore.
[04:04.72]I'm going to be very surprised if that's not the case.
[04:07.08]So you'll never see this ever again.
[04:08.64]In fact, I can't wait to uninstall it from Steam.
[04:12.86]Secondly, on the 8th, guess what comes out on the 8th?
[04:17.68]I didn't even know this until a week ago.
[04:20.88]That's right.
[04:21.78]Monster Rancher 1 and 2 remake.
[04:25.16]It's not a remake, it's just a port.
[04:27.50]We're gonna play it.
[04:28.96]You bet your ass.
[04:31.44]And then on the 9th, Game Awards, obviously.
[04:34.60]I'll be streaming the Game Awards like I always do.
[04:38.34]Then...
[04:40.34]That's it.
[04:40.70]That's all I have planned for this week.
[04:44.78]I'm very excited.
[04:45.54]I'm very excited to play Monster Rancher 1 and 2.
[04:51.90]Beanbag Sonic lives again.
[04:58.55]I'm really glad the game awards are at like 4 o'clock in the afternoon or 5 in the afternoon.
[05:03.91]You want some lore?
[05:04.63]Remember the Nintendo Direct that was at 9 a.m.? ?
[05:09.94]specific that was I I don't think I even showered I just ripped myself out of bed ran in the room put my bathrobe on put some water in my hair and turned it on I I felt like during that stream nothing happens before noon here it just does it's been like that since I was like 12 15. doesn't matter
[05:36.24]Guys, I can't even eat before noon.
[05:39.09]I get up in the morning and it's like, nope, nothing.
[05:41.21]I can't.
[05:41.83]I'm useless until 12 o'clock.
[05:44.69]And then at 2 p.m., I'm at peak readiness.
[05:48.19]Here we go.
[05:49.02]From 2 to 10 or 2 to 8 is like I got the most energy.
[05:53.20]I'm ready to go.
[05:53.60]I'm hungry.
[05:54.08]I'm ready to go.
[05:55.48]I don't even know why is that.
[05:58.70]How come, why does my body reject food for two or three hours after I wake up?
[06:03.86]I don't get it.
[06:04.66]It's, I don't, I'm not, my hunger reflex is gone.
[06:06.52]I'm like, it makes me kind of nauseous.
[06:11.54]It's an ADHD thing?
[06:12.68]Is it really?
[06:13.04]That's interesting.
[06:15.38]Somebody said you're gaining viewers.
[06:20.55]Uh, yeah, I just turned the stream on.
[06:22.03]Yeah.
[06:24.57]Of course I'm going to be gaining viewers.
[06:26.33]It's the first five minutes of the stream.
[06:32.36]What you need to do is you need to wait till like the end of the stream or after like a few hours of Resident Evil 6 and like 4,000 people that are here.
[06:40.09]They say like pog a bunch of times and then they just leave because this game sucks.
[06:46.05]I'm ready.
[06:47.13]That's when you say viewers plummeting, right?
[06:49.55]You gotta be ready for that one.
[06:55.21]What?
[06:55.33]How many people are here now?
[06:58.43]Oh shit.
[06:59.94]Oh shit, the 6k already?
[07:01.69]We haven't even started!
[07:06.79]No.
[07:07.23]You know what?
[07:07.71]I'll tell you.
[07:08.59]I have not even been paying attention to my view count.
[07:11.79]I haven't even been looking at it.
[07:12.55]It's just something that I know exists.
[07:19.54]9k now?
[07:20.84]No, I don't care.
[07:21.66]Don't get me looking at the view count.
[07:22.88]I don't even want to look at it.
[07:25.93]There could be 100 people here.
[07:27.37]Or like 100,000.
[07:27.91]I don't even want to know.
[07:30.13]Don't tell me.
[07:31.79]But I mean, if we hit 20k, then I gotta celebrate that one.
[07:36.25]Well, I already did.
[07:37.05]You're gonna do a face reveal?
[07:45.10]Yeah.
[07:45.98]You've got a positive outlook?
[07:47.68]No, I just... Alright.
[07:50.02]I just... I don't want to pay attention to it.
[07:52.00]Why would I?
[07:55.50]Let me check and see if he's here.
[07:56.57]Not.
[08:00.24]But yeah, while there's more people trickling in, just listen.
[08:03.34]End of the year awards.
[08:05.58]There's a lot of new people since the last time we did this, so let's make this really clear.
[08:09.52]This is, I believe, the fourth annual worst shit of the year awards.
[08:14.37]Where it's not like a typical awards stream that you may be used to.
[08:19.11]We go over, over the course of 2021, all the worst shit, all like the cringiest, weirdest shit that apparently I've done.
[08:27.04]um there's also best stream of the year there's also like best joke of the year with things like worst face uh worst sound I made worse singing worst impressions best impression best noise of it's it's fun Jerma and cringe never worse 2021.
[08:52.37]Yeah, best one guy.
[08:53.73]We take something that one guy in the community did.
[08:57.36]The emote, right?
[08:58.30]When are you going to do a Nyaners collab?
[09:04.36]Let's go!
[09:04.80]Nyaners, let's go!
[09:06.02]Alright, listen.
[09:13.93]Anytime anybody ever says, like, Oh, dude!
[09:17.44]When are you going to do collab with this person?
[09:20.06]Oh, dude, hold on.
[09:20.69]Let me call him right now.
[09:26.41]Oh, hey, hey, before you say any words, hey, do you want to do a collab stream on Monday?
[09:35.01]Yeah, I got time.
[09:35.57]You got time?
[09:36.91]Okay, now say hello.
[09:39.40]What do you want to do?
[09:40.14]It's just if it happens, it happens.
[09:42.30]There's a project that I think is interesting.
[09:44.80]If I want to collaborate with somebody, then we collaborate.
[09:47.35]I think Nanners is fucking hilarious.
[09:54.19]Of course that would be fun, maybe.
[09:55.49]But if it's gonna happen, maybe it could.
[10:01.25]I would say that about anybody.
[10:03.69]Literally anyone.
[10:15.92]Do everyone call me anti-social Andy?
[10:18.26]I'm about to do a collaboration in 10 minutes.
[10:21.50]Like, I'm in the call right now with somebody.
[10:28.19]I'm open to collaborations, but I'm closed to everything.
[10:32.81]That's really weird to say, but it's accurate.
[10:43.27]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[10:44.15]Hold on a minute.
[10:45.38]I'm open to collaborations.
[10:47.10]I am closed to solicitations.
[10:48.72]Okay.
[10:51.66]See?
[10:52.74]That's a perfect way to say it.
[10:55.04]When are you going to do 1080p streams?
[10:58.89]Um, I don't know.
[10:59.47]When... When I... I'm not going to know.
[11:02.11]I don't know.
[11:06.27]Okay, I think we're ready.
[11:09.12]Hey, did we get kicked out of the lobby?
[11:10.28]I hope not.
[11:10.70]I haven't been looking.
[11:14.90]Okay, you're actually in?
[11:16.02]Okay, cool.
[11:16.84]Yeah.
[11:18.10]All tapping freaks me out, though.
[11:19.72]Yeah, I don't like it.
[11:20.44]Let's see.
[11:22.62]Make sure the camera's not on.
[11:26.36]Is the camera on?
[11:28.05]Oh, fuck.
[11:28.51]Please don't be on.
[11:30.99]Don't be on.
[11:32.59]Alright.
[11:36.05]What's the freeze frame?
[11:37.43]It's good.
[11:38.90]I don't have one camera.
[11:40.75]Alright, so we're going to play Resident Evil 6.
[11:42.89]It's going to be a fun time.
[11:44.35]It's going to be fun.
[11:46.31]Like I was telling Chaz, this is the best, most critically acclaimed Resident Evil.
[11:50.74]This is the worst one.
[11:52.90]What does your title say?
[11:54.95]It's... My title says, uh... Oh, I gotta... You gotta make me alt-tab.
[11:58.47]My title says, picking the best Resident Evil for the Halloween co-op stream.
[12:02.87]Mine says it's the worst.
[12:04.98]My stream title, I swear to God, actually says literally the worst one.
[12:09.68]So, I mean, we'll find out.
[12:12.40]That's yin and yang energy right there.
[12:13.96]Alright, so we skip the opening cutscene because who really cares?
[12:17.22]There's a virus on the loose and we have to track down the fucking tyrant or whatever.
[12:20.34]Alright, let's go.
[12:21.58]You ready?
[12:23.91]I'm walking as fast as I can towards this door.
[12:27.07]There's no sprint in Resident Evil 6, right?
[12:28.49]I didn't see one.
[12:29.95]There's a dash.
[12:30.57]There's a dash.
[12:32.63]There's a dash?
[12:34.10]Yeah, there's a dash button.
[12:35.24]I don't know what it is because I did the tutorial with a controller.
[12:39.02]Oh, that's right.
[12:39.52]You're on controller.
[12:40.56]I'm on keyboard.
[12:41.18]No, I switched to keyboard and mouse because you made me feel insecure.
[12:43.90]You were like, I got to up my accuracy.
[12:45.74]So I was like, well, I got to compete.
[12:46.88]I got to up my accuracy.
[12:48.02]So then I switched to mouse.
[12:49.21]Well, but the whole point is that... I would have more accuracy than you because you're on controller.
[12:53.65]And now you're gonna make me look bad.
[12:54.71]Okay.
[12:56.52]Turn on an ASCAM.
[12:58.46]How would that work?
[13:00.34]Where would the camera be?
[13:00.98]ASCAM's on by default if you haven't changed the FOV.
[13:03.48]It's pretty zoomed in.
[13:04.58]Yeah, I did.
[13:05.18]I moved the FOV.
[13:06.76]What?
[13:07.92]Yeah.
[13:09.30]You have to do that from the main menu, I was told.
[13:11.40]What?
[13:11.94]Do you?
[13:12.36]No, you don't.
[13:13.00]Oh, yeah, you do.
[13:13.46]How do you... Wait, I'm gonna stand in here.
[13:19.54]It's a co-op moment.
[13:20.96]Oh, it's a co-op thing.
[13:22.78]I don't know how to... Okay, there we go.
[13:24.26]Okay, press V. Aim for the head.
[13:26.88]If somebody said, if you want to toggle sprint, you have to go to the main menu and press the hilarious joke that everyone's heard a thousand times back in like 2010.
[13:38.94]Alright.
[13:41.92]I think sprint is alt F4.
[13:42.92]Is that what they're saying?
[13:44.50]You got it.
[13:44.80]Alright, so this is how it works.
[13:47.12]We have to...
[13:49.17]Is it?
[13:51.21]Shift doesn't do anything.
[13:53.02]Alright, that feels good.
[13:56.38]I want to make this really clear to everybody watching right now.
[13:58.80]I have a script running in the background to make it so I can toggle right click.
[14:02.03]No, but listen.
[14:02.99]Like...
[14:09.11]There's probably something that's going to need... There's probably something that's going to need me to just tap right click and you have to do it because I have a script enabled.
[14:17.88]Have you noticed how neither of us have responded to a single individual chatter on the entire streams?
[14:22.36]I did, Earl.
[14:22.86]I did like five seconds ago.
[14:24.57]Plant.
[14:26.43]No, you just don't pay attention to your chat like I do.
[14:28.11]You don't know... I'm like... Me and my chat get together.
[14:31.19]We know each other.
[14:31.71]Alright, follow the chat.
[14:35.05]We can actually run.
[14:35.59]This is good.
[14:36.53]Oh, happy birthday!
[14:39.77]Is it your birthday?
[14:41.07]Holy shit, thanks, dude.
[14:42.31]Why did I say thanks?
[14:45.01]Hey, is it your birthday?
[14:46.69]Yeah, thanks, dude.
[14:47.71]I'm so glad that you were born and you live one more year.
[14:50.25]Thanks, dude.
[14:52.77]Alright, so we're... I'll be honest with you.
[14:55.65]I gotta be really honest with you.
[14:57.59]I don't care about any of this.
[14:58.97]You don't care about my birthday?
[15:03.28]Of course I care about your birthday.
[15:10.01]Why is everybody saying- Oh, the game's quiet.
[15:12.02]Yeah, I know.
[15:13.20]I'm a quiet game, Andy.
[15:14.24]So, we missed the opening cutscene.
[15:17.94]Yeah.
[15:23.29]Wait, this is in media res.
[15:24.73]This is going to be one of those... Okay, really though?
[15:27.13]That's how the real game opens.
[15:29.45]They start with like a badass action scene because they're afraid they're not going to like catch your attention in time.
[15:35.34]So a helicopter is like scraping a train and then the bad guy drops in and then they go, oh, it's you again.
[15:41.92]And then it cuts to like three weeks earlier and that's where we're at now.
[15:44.58]I thought I was playing the stacker game.
[15:47.07]Who's puking?
[15:51.55]Did you see the birthday cake?
[15:52.71]I mean,
[15:54.10]I don't want to turn that up.
[15:54.80]Alright.
[15:55.34]Is that better?
[15:55.76]That was like, that was like grocery store birthday cake.
[15:58.56]It's probably just in the bathroom.
[16:01.34]Is that better?
[16:01.76]I can hear you now.
[16:04.92]Well, no, I just for the end game.
[16:06.25]I have it low.
[16:08.15]Why can I not fire my gun?
[16:10.35]Did you try to shoot me at the same time?
[16:12.23]No, I've tried.
[16:13.27]Why do we not have bullets in our weapons that we brought here?
[16:19.91]I'm going to put an orange tip on the muzzle of this gun.
[16:22.75]This is giving me a headache because of how shitty the frame rate is for this.
[16:25.43]I don't know why.
[16:28.21]I'm sorry.
[16:29.15]Is your 3080 not qualified for this 2012 video game?
[16:32.53]Does this look as bad as it does?
[16:34.01]It looks awful.
[16:34.55]I mean, it looks like 2012, but the frame rate's fine.
[16:37.82]My frame rate's all over the place.
[16:38.96]It's just really zoomed in.
[16:42.28]Turn off the V-Sync.
[16:44.74]I think it's off.
[16:50.72]I turned Vsync on and I capped frames to 60.
[16:55.08]I did that too.
[16:58.90]Maybe it's trying to render 120... That's weird.
[17:01.42]I might have to fix this eventually.
[17:05.82]Alright, once we get into this... Well, if you want to fix it, let's fix it now.
[17:08.66]Well, no, because we need a save point because I don't want to do this again.
[17:13.38]Let's get to like a point.
[17:16.58]We call them checkpoints as gamers.
[17:18.04]Yeah.
[17:20.46]Alright, search the campus for Liz.
[17:24.98]I don't understand why we have our guns out holding it like this.
[17:28.36]We don't have bullets.
[17:29.54]Why would we have them out?
[17:31.68]There we go.
[17:32.34]That's a fucking... That's what I'm talking about.
[17:37.09]Take out a knife?
[17:38.45]You can swing the knife, I think?
[17:39.29]That guy didn't get scared at all.
[17:41.05]Why did he not get scared?
[17:55.19]Should we be looking for weapons?
[17:56.81]The lights are on.
[17:58.93]Oh, in here.
[18:00.71]Wait, I do have ammo.
[18:02.41]It says I have 18.
[18:04.25]What?
[18:05.65]Oh.
[18:06.03]Okay, now we have 17.
[18:13.91]Where do you even see 17?
[18:14.67]Is the headlamp coming out of my eyeballs?
[18:16.61]Oh, no, we have an ear mounted.
[18:18.25]Do you have to physically count the bullets over there?
[18:20.97]I don't know.
[18:22.39]I just took the number that you said.
[18:25.56]I think it's in the inventory.
[18:26.38]Alright, don't do anything cool.
[18:30.64]I'm gonna, I'm gonna alt-tab for a sec.
[18:33.02]Hope you don't get booted.
[18:34.50]Okay, alright.
[18:37.86]This guy does not, nothing phases this guy.
[18:41.33]What?
[18:41.63]He's the main character.
[18:42.87]That's quite a draft.
[18:44.47]He's leading us.
[18:45.35]Like, we're the NPC on the follow mission.
[18:47.39]He's escorting us.
[18:48.27]Why is he not reacting to any of this?
[18:51.45]I've seen some shit.
[18:55.69]Yeah, you have a hole in your head.
[18:56.67]I feel like somebody drilled a hole, like, that demons are escaping you.
[19:02.36]Like, your soul is escaping.
[19:03.58]What?
[19:04.12]Oh, from the light?
[19:04.88]You've got a light, too.
[19:05.86]Yeah, but it's... There's, like, a weird hole in your head.
[19:07.50]It's coming out of your, like, luscious locks that you've got, Leon.
[19:10.54]You've got no brain in there, man.
[19:11.84]I can shine a flashlight in there and just see light.
[19:14.64]Personal attacks.
[19:15.44]I'm your partner.
[19:16.34]I'm your resident partner for, like, the last ten years in this game.
[19:19.48]How are we going?
[19:20.36]I have some respect for the most popular Resident Evil character of all time, Helena.
[19:30.63]Everybody knows Helena from the opening cutscene of this game.
[19:33.48]I don't like the fact that we can't... What happened?
[19:40.18]I thought he shot me.
[19:41.88]Does that hurt me?
[19:43.90]That was a balloon jump scare.
[19:45.83]Oh, that was bad.
[19:46.59]I missed every shot.
[19:50.13]Controller has auto-aim.
[19:51.09]Did he just say, it's your daddy?
[19:53.65]I think we're looking for his daughter or something.
[19:55.23]I don't know.
[19:58.15]Okay, can we just kill him now?
[19:59.34]He's clearly infected.
[20:00.78]You don't know that, though.
[20:02.74]You're going to do what I just tried to do.
[20:05.13]It didn't work.
[20:08.11]Wait, is he running for president of the United States?
[20:10.55]Is this the same guy?
[20:11.45]Oh, President Adam Benford.
[20:13.59]It's this guy.
[20:14.21]Okay.
[20:19.52]I just scared him.
[20:20.90]Alright, the chandelier dropping and a fire starting in front of him is not scary.
[20:25.04]But he's looking at the constitution or whatever this is and it scared the shit out of him.
[20:28.90]Get ready to kill him.
[20:30.13]I think we have to open this.
[20:31.07]No, he's just opening it.
[20:33.33]How do you reload?
[20:34.15]I have no idea.
[20:34.85]Wait, we can't even reload.
[20:35.89]Oh, by the way, it's his fault if we die because he said we should put it on veteran.
[20:57.10]It's your fault.
[20:57.94]If we'd lose.
[20:58.36]Yeah, that's the medium difficulty.
[21:00.96]There's five difficulties.
[21:02.76]Veteran's the third one.
[21:05.54]That's just enough to not lose gamer points, but it's also not enough to gain gamer points.
[21:10.12]I mean, I'm just saying, we could have said we were on veteran and play on easy.
[21:14.65]Alright, so wait, wait, wait.
[21:18.19]So he... We have to make the elevator work?
[21:21.97]But it should... Okay, wait.
[21:23.97]We need a...
[21:27.22]He's gliding over here.
[21:28.10]Okay.
[21:29.94]This is cool.
[21:33.12]Resident Evil 6 is actually a walking simulator.
[21:36.46]The guns are kind of like in Universal Studios when you go on a ride, you know?
[21:39.35]They're just little laser points that you can tally up at the end of the game.
[21:43.43]It is weird to not have the flashlight on the gun.
[21:46.85]It's like on the side of our heads.
[21:49.45]2012, that wasn't invented yet.
[21:50.31]You're not paying attention.
[21:53.96]That would take like extra dynamic light.
[21:55.68]Careful.
[21:58.21]Does it really matter if I'm paying attention?
[21:59.69]I have watched, like, at least one or two Will Ferrell movies with no sound on.
[22:03.37]And just, like, I can know what's happening by the movements that he's doing on screen.
[22:06.66]Like, it doesn't matter.
[22:08.84]Why do you have to take the left?
[22:09.96]I don't know.
[22:14.16]I don't know, like, your mother, like, mom calls.
[22:15.92]And, like, I want to talk to mom for, like, an hour and a half.
[22:17.78]Which is just the exact run time of, like, Will Ferrell's last movie.
[22:23.57]I didn't even aim and it did it for me.
[22:25.59]Yeah.
[22:31.53]How long is a phone call with mom?
[22:35.19]It's usually like an hour or two, right?
[22:36.95]Yeah.
[22:38.03]That's what I'm saying.
[22:39.12]Why is everyone question marking?
[22:43.44]Are you saying that playing this game reminds you of calling your mom?
[22:47.86]No, I'm just saying a Will Ferrell movie is the exact length of time for a phone call with mom.
[22:52.88]Yeah, so next time you're watching a Will Ferrell movie, just think about the last time you called your mom.
[22:56.40]And then mute the Will Ferrell movie.
[23:01.10]How do we get out of here?
[23:01.88]10 minutes?
[23:03.30]Excuse me, you gotta talk to mom longer than that.
[23:06.06]That depends on if you, if, okay, but here's the thing.
[23:07.86]You're talking to a bunch of people who still live with mom.
[23:10.68]So they can't fathom calling her because she's in the other room.
[23:14.53]I, I would, I would agree with that maybe a little bit, but, um, we did a poll.
[23:18.75]We did like a census on the channel and it's like 40% doctor, 20% scientist.
[23:24.55]Um, there's like 10%, uh, like firefighter and shit.
[23:28.44]Like these people, they're not just like at home.
[23:30.10]Okay.
[23:34.66]You got like a large proportion of firefighting moms in the chat?
[23:41.19]When do we get to play the game?
[23:46.29]They're waiting for us to go to the elevator.
[23:48.05]Hold on, we're going to have to move this.
[23:51.90]It's going to take both of our combined strength.
[23:54.26]Is it really?
[23:55.36]Oh, it does.
[23:59.68]This whole game so far has been just like your annoying upstairs neighbor in your apartment.
[24:05.96]It's just been the fucking sounds, like the walking sounds.
[24:10.07]Oh, the creaking boards.
[24:13.41]Okay.
[24:15.05]Oh, this is so ugly.
[24:15.83]I'm really sorry for everybody that has to put up with this for now.
[24:21.17]Jerma's entire fanbase is milked.
[24:27.33]I can't imagine like that, like...
[24:30.25]Imagine doing like a meet and greet.
[24:32.79]It's like all like older women.
[24:35.31]It's all like just there for the meet and greet.
[24:38.78]If you stay a streamer long enough.
[24:45.92]Make that a reality.
[24:48.18]I mean, I'm almost 40, man.
[24:55.33]That's called daytime TV.
[25:07.51]I thought that was the game.
[25:10.39]You just freaked me out.
[25:11.81]I was like, why are they leaning so hard into that?
[25:25.22]Got to do the puking off screen.
[25:27.26]This is an EG game.
[25:29.00]Let's get this ready.
[25:30.50]I'm going to shoot him in the head.
[25:31.83]You shoot him in the chest.
[25:32.49]We're going to shoot him five times each.
[25:35.21]I'm going to shoot once in the head.
[25:38.41]I don't think you have a choice.
[25:40.49]What the fuck?
[25:41.23]What was that?
[25:41.77]What was that like DDR?
[25:43.41]It was just DDR.
[25:43.95]Why is the camera...
[25:52.94]I thought that was her doing that to you for a second.
[25:55.04]I was like, why does she have a gun?
[25:56.14]Did you pull the trigger or was that all of me?
[25:58.10]I shot her in the back.
[26:00.14]Is it arrow keys?
[26:02.34]I think it's just WASD.
[26:03.70]It correlates.
[26:05.78]This is going to get really difficult with the QTs on the keyboard.
[26:13.21]How could this?
[26:14.57]I was about to scream it, but you're in.
[26:17.03]It's like a yawn.
[26:18.45]Now I want to.
[26:20.44]I was about to scream it.
[26:22.86]But there's a lot of people that were really pissed off about that.
[26:25.57]So I'm glad.
[26:26.97]Don't let him in.
[26:28.39]Don't let this guy in.
[26:30.75]Oh, there's too many people on the elevator.
[26:32.21]I can't.
[26:39.92]Alright, we have to get this way.
[26:42.56]Bang.
[26:43.32]Bingo.
[26:44.36]Boink.
[26:46.58]How do you reload?
[26:47.12]I don't have any bullets left.
[26:48.76]Run.
[26:49.28]Oh, that guy's got a pipe.
[26:50.40]I don't think there is one.
[26:52.10]Nope.
[27:08.30]Space?
[27:08.62]What do you mean space?
[27:10.22]Hold space.
[27:11.90]Oh, that's weird.
[27:12.53]Okay.
[27:14.85]I feel like this is somebody pretending to run.
[27:17.17]It's not somebody actually running.
[27:19.67]Okay, that actually reminds me.
[27:22.81]After this cutscene, I'll show you.
[27:34.52]Dude, does like security guards actually have this many screens?
[27:38.25]Yeah, I think so.
[27:39.92]Are those two people who've been banned from your channel?
[27:45.84]Let us back in.
[27:46.60]I promise.
[27:49.10]I promise I won't have to see your shit-filled diaper again.
[27:51.50]I promise.
[27:54.84]Get him.
[27:55.10]Get him, Marge.
[27:56.36]Leon, it's too late.
[27:59.56]There's nothing we can do.
[28:00.61]Press space twice when you're aimed in.
[28:03.33]Okay.
[28:07.44]Oh, I was explicitly told to not talk about diapers.
[28:11.84]Explicitly.
[28:12.48]Yeah.
[28:13.44]I'm not even kidding.
[28:14.40]Probably at least three or four people.
[28:15.38]Let's get the hell out of here.
[28:18.42]You must have struck a nerve.
[28:20.22]I just was told don't do that.
[28:21.24]It's like fucking weird.
[28:26.38]It's been at least three people have told me that.
[28:30.10]Alright.
[28:30.74]Pause for a sec.
[28:31.42]Okay.
[28:31.70]I need to turn sensitivity like.
[28:34.65]Yes.
[28:34.95]All the way down.
[28:37.32]Somebody said you can, if you double tap space.
[28:39.02]What the hell are you doing?
[28:40.56]Oh, it's like a dodge.
[28:42.14]Oh!
[28:42.80]Holy shit, what?
[28:46.90]Are you seeing this?
[28:48.08]I can't focus on the settings because I'm stupid.
[28:53.34]This is like the easiest way to get a bunch of like splinters all over your body.
[28:57.20]Okay, that's cool.
[28:59.48]I want, do we share stuff on the ground?
[29:04.14]I wonder.
[29:05.95]You have to see that from my perspective.
[29:08.32]Alright, um... Do we share what?
[29:10.80]Do we share items, like on the ground?
[29:12.32]Because I just picked up ammo, and if there's no ammo on the ground, then this is bad.
[29:16.40]I'll look, but I can't... Alright, control settings.
[29:20.36]Can I break boxes?
[29:21.14]I don't think so.
[29:29.09]Is it camera speed?
[29:30.95]It's, yeah, camera speed is, and then there's aim speed, too.
[29:34.13]aim speed okay aim speed is when you're aimed down sights and camera speed is just you walking around there we go and if you put it at zero don't worry it's every video game ever made uh it's still horrible uh you have to go you have to go from zero to two out of sometimes potentially a hundred um I still don't understand why that's a thing uh it is a pc video game double tap space when not aiming
[30:01.93]My run looks like I'm about to, like, go on stage at a Broadway.
[30:04.59]Okay, no, I think you have to be... Okay, so when you're aiming, if you hold a direction and hit space, you'll dive.
[30:11.36]Then you can get back up.
[30:14.66]Alright, you ready?
[30:19.40]Alright.
[30:20.64]Overly, uh, complex, but yep, I'm... Wait, hold on.
[30:27.43]Oh, shit!
[30:30.20]That's actually kind of cool.
[30:32.12]Why do people say this is the worst one?
[30:34.10]Jump down the stairs.
[30:41.13]Cool.
[30:41.25]I think they just kind of... They overdid it with every video game having like a jump slowdown that... It just became taboo to ever do it again.
[30:55.70]Keep an eye out for items, too.
[30:57.46]I feel like we're just skipping everything.
[30:58.54]Oh, yeah.
[30:58.82]You got... You picked up the ammo.
[31:00.06]I didn't get any ammo.
[31:00.72]You didn't get any ammo.
[31:01.58]Oh, that's not good.
[31:03.02]Unless... Unless I just didn't look where you look.
[31:06.19]Can we break this stuff?
[31:09.79]I've got a bad feeling about this.
[31:12.37]Is that... Is that the... Be honest.
[31:13.79]Is that the voice actor for Levi?
[31:16.51]I don't know.
[31:17.07]It might be.
[31:17.99]Is that the... Is that the... I'm not going to do it because it's hollow ground.
[31:22.40]But, you know, the potential's there.
[31:25.18]To do Captain Levi from Attack on Titan?
[31:32.74]Don't you fucking dare get that into my blood.
[31:37.93]How dare you do that?
[31:40.11]There's two things that you were told when we were in the private Discord together.
[31:44.63]Do not mention Attack on Titan, especially any of the main characters.
[31:47.71]That was one of the things.
[31:48.89]And you did the thumbs up emote on the fucking text on Discord too.
[31:53.29]I know you saw it.
[31:55.85]Where we go?
[31:59.57]What?
[31:59.96]Oh.
[32:00.26]Press E while aiming.
[32:05.32]Oh shit, you can do double pistol?
[32:12.07]Why would we be hiding?
[32:13.13]Oh, dual welding, yup.
[32:28.72]I'm just picking up all the ammo.
[32:30.10]I hope you're not mad about that.
[32:32.62]I think there actually is skills in this game.
[32:34.67]I really do.
[32:35.79]I actually think we do.
[32:36.41]Alright, so we're in the wrong place here.
[32:48.55]ResidentSleeper 6.
[32:49.35]Yep.
[32:51.23]Admit it is.
[32:52.35]Good one, Chad.
[32:53.25]No, that actually is a good one because this one is the worst one.
[32:56.63]What's that?
[32:59.72]Probably just ambient sound effect.
[33:01.60]Oh, I thought the soda machine just broke.
[33:03.58]I was, uh, okay.
[33:06.98]Alright, we've... You know what?
[33:09.20]Can I just talk about how stupid video games are?
[33:12.52]We can just walk over that.
[33:13.36]Help me!
[33:17.83]I've wasted so much ammo.
[33:18.97]I don't know why.
[33:19.83]How do you dual wield?
[33:21.37]Why can't we just walk over this?
[33:23.22]Video games are dumb.
[33:24.48]I hate them.
[33:28.82]Look out!
[33:35.32]I have to stop fucking around because I'm seriously going to not have enough ammo.
[33:38.88]You shoot for... Okay, you're going to have to shoot for another hour because I just used an hour of ammo.
[33:44.31]Please do good because that was probably the next 45 minutes of in-game ammo.
[33:52.94]What's the melee button?
[33:56.28]You've got a knife?
[33:57.44]I think you can just do the... Oh, I've got a shotgun.
[33:59.56]Wait, why do you have a shotgun?
[34:01.80]Because we're different people, okay?
[34:03.28]You don't have to be like me.
[34:05.12]Well, you get a shotgun and I get a knife.
[34:07.48]Oh, it's because I paid for Capcom Plus.
[34:09.99]Yeah, by the way, I know you still were paying for that.
[34:14.49]Go ahead, everybody.
[34:16.91]It's a confession here.
[34:17.59]Go ahead.
[34:17.99]Tell them.
[34:19.53]I am still paying for Ubisoft Plus.
[34:24.06]I forgot to cancel it.
[34:25.50]And I still paid less for Far Cry than you did.
[34:31.36]But I didn't look like a geek with all the I paid for the items shit.
[34:34.70]So who really won?
[34:38.36]Oh my god.
[34:41.04]Help!
[34:41.68]I have Neon.
[34:43.99]I have neon armor.
[34:46.27]Are you gonna help me with a knife?
[34:48.04]Holy shit!
[34:50.10]Okay.
[34:50.90]Wait, there's herbs.
[34:51.72]Don't forget to pick those up.
[34:53.87]I got them.
[34:54.19]Do you want me to craft you a heal?
[34:56.35]Um, what's the I?
[34:57.63]How do you get to the inventory?
[34:58.83]E?
[35:01.25]Okay, what the fuck is this inventory?
[35:05.20]I don't know how to scroll over.
[35:05.94]I'm confused.
[35:06.46]How do you go down?
[35:07.16]Oh, it's mouse wheel.
[35:08.92]Okay, but... Mouse wheel and... What's down the bottom?
[35:12.26]What's all this weird shit here?
[35:13.12]That's probably like actual usables.
[35:16.02]Oh, okay.
[35:16.84]Like materials up top, full product down below.
[35:20.78]Um, alright.
[35:23.52]That's probably the... I really don't want to be like a dick or anything, and I hate to say this.
[35:28.50]This is...
[35:30.75]It's 2012.
[35:31.55]It was a different time.
[35:32.61]They were doing... Resident Evil had the same UI since like fucking 1996, so I don't buy that.
[35:40.37]They were trying to get creative.
[35:43.46]They wanted everything to be in-game.
[35:45.54]This is a fucking horizontal Metal Gear Solid inventory.
[35:48.36]And holy shit, I hate that inventory system.
[35:50.46]I'm sorry.
[35:52.26]Oh, yeah.
[35:52.58]No, it's bad.
[35:53.38]It's bad.
[35:54.30]You got any dual wield?
[35:55.56]Okay.
[35:55.88]How do you do that?
[35:57.54]Just melee.
[35:58.46]Holy shit.
[35:58.82]I just did a diamond cutter to somebody.
[36:00.04]I literally just RKO'd that person.
[36:01.62]What?
[36:04.80]That was awesome.
[36:06.18]Yeah, do it again.
[36:06.76]No reason for me to waste any ammo.
[36:15.45]Metal Gear Solid is an amazing game.
[36:16.73]I just don't like the inventory.
[36:23.39]This is a three-shot double-barrel shotgun.
[36:26.67]No, it's a triple-barrel shotgun.
[36:28.25]Oh, incendiary grenade.
[36:29.25]Cool.
[36:35.33]Oh, badass.
[36:36.19]Go!
[36:36.35]Resident Evil 5 is the Mona Lisa of video games compared to this.
[36:41.54]Um...
[36:48.58]Well, when... Mona Lisa of video games.
[36:51.35]But, you have to understand something.
[36:52.95]This is like... First of all.
[36:53.91]This is the same tier of games that come in the cereal box.
[36:56.87]So, that's not fair.
[36:57.51]What were you going to say?
[37:00.87]You said, first of all, I want to know.
[37:02.17]I've seen Mona Lisa in real life, and honestly, it wasn't that impressive.
[37:06.35]It's smaller than you think.
[37:07.97]Are you okay?
[37:10.49]What the fuck?
[37:12.03]Yeah, okay.
[37:12.41]There's like a spam button.
[37:14.37]P.T.E.
[37:19.92]Sorry.
[37:20.24]Did that hit me?
[37:22.34]Yeah.
[37:23.74]His body is falling apart.
[37:29.34]Can I actually... I want that.
[37:32.46]Can I pick that up?
[37:36.60]The sledgehammer that just disappeared?
[37:38.18]No, I don't think you can.
[37:39.08]That's an unforgivable sin in video games when there's items that people are using and you can't have them.
[37:44.93]You've just played too much Dead Rising is all.
[37:47.53]That's unforgivable.
[37:53.50]If there's a swinging animation that the character is using and it falls on the ground, it's an actual, it's own object.
[37:58.21]It's a piece.
[37:58.71]It's a placement of graphical and input unity.
[38:01.57]Whatever it is.
[38:03.37]If it's... No, I'm just saying, like, if it's in the engine, then why can't I use it?
[38:10.97]Graphical and input unity.
[38:22.71]Graphical input user.
[38:25.31]How do I get to the grenade?
[38:26.37]Is this a college?
[38:33.16]Okay.
[38:37.24]G?
[38:37.58]It's not G. Does it not look like I am doing some kind of like stage dance when I run?
[38:45.27]Okay, you stand right there at the door, but like turn around.
[38:47.95]I can't.
[38:48.73]I can see everything you're doing though.
[38:50.61]Okay, hold on.
[38:51.75]Am I off screen?
[38:52.80]You are off-screen stage left for me.
[38:54.92]Okay, hold on.
[38:59.72]Is, like, the motion of my arms not... You just look like you're running around.
[39:10.02]I'm so patiently waiting for you at the door.
[39:11.79]I'm just looking... I see everything you're doing, but I'm not going to acknowledge it for some reason.
[39:16.93]This is so normal that I'm just going to give you a minute, and then you're eventually going to come over here.
[39:20.89]Okay.
[39:23.27]That was very normal.
[39:25.91]Okay.
[39:27.16]Wait.
[39:28.06]Okay.
[39:28.36]Ammo.
[39:30.12]If we stop doing that, we need those to distract them.
[39:38.67]No, because this is a fighting hall.
[39:40.59]We're going to try the door.
[39:41.51]Something's going to be jammed.
[39:42.97]We're going to turn around.
[39:44.11]They're all going to come to life and we have to fight out the door.
[39:46.39]Alex, it's just going to open.
[39:47.35]Watch.
[39:47.71]Oh, yeah.
[39:56.38]Then again, the door's locked.
[39:57.56]I told you!
[39:58.96]That's the way I called this 100%.
[40:00.06]That's corner pocket.
[40:02.44]I have to move.
[40:05.36]Alright, this is just literally like Left 4 Dead right now.
[40:07.58]Alright.
[40:08.48]Skill points.
[40:09.68]Just wait till they come in.
[40:10.44]Who cares?
[40:10.78]I don't even shoot.
[40:11.46]Actually, we probably should shoot them.
[40:13.56]I mean, yeah.
[40:14.26]They're gonna come in.
[40:15.76]Now we know all the infected were hiding out.
[40:21.68]Half your head is gone.
[40:22.82]Wait till they get in at least so you can get skill points.
[40:24.32]This guy just threw a bottle at me.
[40:28.94]The melee is better than shooting a gun.
[40:30.80]I'm just telling you.
[40:36.48]I'm tripping over their bodies.
[40:37.74]This is some pretty tight security for a college campus.
[40:42.45]The melee is better.
[40:43.37]I have a shotgun.
[40:45.21]If I can upgrade this, I will.
[40:47.49]Oh my god.
[40:49.67]Why am I just falling down?
[40:51.07]Okay, the FOV is actually pretty bad.
[40:56.02]That person just...
[40:57.94]Okay, so this is what you're talking about.
[40:58.92]The X. Pick up the X. Can you pick it up?
[41:01.68]Ow.
[41:06.54]Sick wrestling move.
[41:07.38]You're gonna die?
[41:08.00]No, I'm not gonna die.
[41:12.16]I just have to figure out how to heal.
[41:14.68]What just happened?
[41:15.36]Did you just kill me?
[41:16.84]What?
[41:17.94]Did I?
[41:18.82]You just hit me in the face with something.
[41:20.70]What did you hit me with?
[41:21.82]I just shot my gun.
[41:22.86]Did I shoot you?
[41:23.54]You shot me in the head.
[41:25.42]No, I didn't.
[41:26.06]You shot me directly in the face.
[41:29.23]I'm dead.
[41:29.81]Again.
[41:30.21]What's happening?
[41:30.87]Where's my health meter?
[41:31.79]You died again?
[41:33.89]But wait, we're dead?
[41:34.73]Why do I feel like this is an arcade game that we've put coins into?
[41:39.11]It's like deliberately shitty and bad and hard.
[41:45.82]We'll find out where the checkpoint is, I guess.
[41:50.28]Oh, it's right here.
[41:50.94]It's right here.
[41:51.86]Keep that trigger finger ready.
[41:53.62]Never know what's around the next corner.
[41:55.38]Oh, foreshadowing.
[41:59.18]By the way, that's totally Levi.
[42:03.12]Probably is.
[42:05.62]There's a stamina meter?
[42:08.87]Okay, so the right top bar is health and the bar underneath that is stamina.
[42:12.89]Alright, we know what this does.
[42:13.83]Let's skip this.
[42:17.13]We can't skip this.
[42:18.07]We have to live it.
[42:20.68]And again, the door's locked.
[42:22.22]There's no way out.
[42:26.27]Zombies don't know how to do that.
[42:28.09]It's so dumb.
[42:29.43]Like, zombies that, like, dodge, like, juke a bullet, like, a gun shooting at them.
[42:33.37]It's, like, that's stupid.
[42:34.57]I don't know, maybe the first 45 minutes?
[42:37.47]Are you prepared, huh?
[42:37.97]What's that from?
[42:38.47]Oh, you didn't play any of those.
[42:52.25]You good over here?
[42:53.31]Yes.
[42:58.95]You alright?
[43:00.19]Yeah, I'm good.
[43:05.03]We probably should just stay back.
[43:07.05]Just stay back here.
[43:07.67]You're too close.
[43:10.17]They're surrounding you right now.
[43:11.71]Yeah, we gotta do the cool melee.
[43:13.95]We just have to live.
[43:14.55]We're in veteran.
[43:15.17]You made us do this.
[43:16.75]Yeah, it's not even that hard, okay?
[43:18.32]I'm not the one that died.
[43:19.18]How do I throw a grenade?
[43:22.24]Holy shit, what the hell happened?
[43:24.26]Her head... But her head, like, melted off.
[43:27.10]You, like, slowly simmered her head until it came off.
[43:31.24]That was, like, a tender, like, pork roast.
[43:38.83]Alright, you got it?
[43:39.45]Got it.
[43:49.85]Oh, skill points.
[43:51.69]It's like actually a hundred lootables on the ground.
[43:55.59]Yeah, I know.
[43:56.12]Get ready to Diablo II this.
[43:57.40]Nope.
[44:00.14]What?
[44:00.38]Sorry.
[44:01.12]You wanted all that stuff too bad.
[44:02.78]Oh my God.
[44:03.56]Are you kidding me?
[44:04.66]What am I supposed to do?
[44:06.26]I think you just WASD really fast.
[44:16.74]I want to throw the grenade.
[44:18.36]What the fuck?
[44:19.08]Why can I not... I don't know how to pick up the grenade.
[44:21.84]It's F?
[44:22.32]What the fuck?
[44:23.20]First A... Oh, okay.
[44:40.94]Alright, so I have it.
[44:42.00]Cool.
[44:43.34]We need to get the key card.
[44:46.58]Yeah, how do you equip a heal?
[44:49.56]Oh, you have to manually do it?
[44:52.16]Press E. And then click it?
[44:54.20]If you have herbs, combine with R for some godforsaken reason.
[44:58.89]Well, because one of each color is a mega herb.
[45:04.36]so combine this with I'll do this with red so that's a um I made a six alright you also then have to highlight the herb yeah press space then press space again to store it in your case and then once it's stored in your case then I don't know it's gone it's there though I almost just threw away bullets alright um
[45:33.95]There's also, like, you can hold Q to turn the entire game, uh... Press 1?
[45:39.11]Oh, what the fuck, dude?
[45:40.44]Don't say that.
[45:41.26]I just ate an herb.
[45:42.64]Why did you say... What are you doing?
[45:43.98]Don't tell me to do that.
[45:44.88]What the fuck?
[45:47.06]Are you healthy now?
[45:48.04]I... I already was.
[45:49.48]I'm not pressing 2.
[45:52.06]There's something here.
[45:54.98]Oh.
[45:57.24]Free stuff.
[45:59.10]There's a key over this way somewhere.
[46:01.30]Oh.
[46:02.52]Nice.
[46:04.49]Not alive.
[46:05.17]It changed.
[46:05.63]It changed it.
[46:06.99]When's the next rock outbreak?
[46:08.67]I just want to chill.
[46:10.76]This is not a thing.
[46:13.18]This is not something you can pick up.
[46:15.30]I just opened this drawer.
[46:16.18]That looks like an item that you put in a door Resident Evil style, right?
[46:19.32]Why can't we not... Collect serpent.
[46:22.52]I just broke it.
[46:24.51]Oh, that's the thing you destroy and you eventually get to unlock stuff.
[46:27.57]Okay.
[46:28.39]Okay.
[46:32.77]I don't do the rock outs anymore.
[46:34.25]The last time I did it... The rock outs?
[46:37.11]Yeah, I just like... I used to do this thing where I would just like put a song on and like air drum and shit.
[46:42.05]But people thought it was like a good cringy and I got a lot of shit for it, so... What are you doing down there?
[46:48.13]What the fuck was that?
[46:49.17]Oh, okay.
[46:50.53]There was a zombie in this room.
[46:52.51]I just stabbed... I just stabbed him in the face.
[46:57.67]Why am I... It'd be nice if I had a heal.
[46:59.81]That'd be fantastic.
[47:02.43]Oh my fucking god, whatever.
[47:05.45]Okay.
[47:06.29]So we're looking for a, uh, we have to escape now?
[47:08.51]We gotta go this way?
[47:11.49]Through the fridge?
[47:12.97]Through the refrigerator?
[47:16.43]Secret trapdoor fridge?
[47:18.57]No, you hold Q. You hold Q. Yeah, you get a little thing where it shows you where to go.
[47:23.97]Nice try.
[47:26.31]Nice try.
[47:28.07]Their bodies are still physical objects even after they're dead.
[47:31.74]I didn't touch him.
[47:35.64]He's gonna get you.
[47:38.65]Shoot him.
[47:41.29]Well, you call it out.
[47:42.09]If you ever played a first person, you go loading.
[47:44.59]You go reloading.
[47:47.45]That's literally the worst thing they put in the game.
[47:52.09]It's like the Super Smash Brothers brawl trip that they put in here for no reason.
[47:58.04]Why is that in the game?
[48:02.45]What?
[48:02.63]Alright, what is happening?
[48:11.73]Comic book balls.
[48:13.79]I've shot the gun in the head so many times.
[48:16.24]Yeah, it's Resident Evil.
[48:17.38]I'm just going to be spamming R. Like, look, it just hit R, R, R, R, R. Nice try.
[48:24.56]Because the skill point's on the ground.
[48:29.32]It's the room we were just in before, right?
[48:30.96]We can pick this stuff up.
[48:32.63]Yeah, did you not while we were walking back through?
[48:35.47]Wait a minute, so you picked everything up already?
[48:39.07]You did not see a single thing on the ground?
[48:40.77]No, I did.
[48:41.23]So I think we do have separate stuff.
[48:43.13]What if one of us picks it up and it gives it to both of us?
[48:45.91]But also, I have a shotgun, so you're not going to get shotgun ammo.
[48:50.49]I love sandwiches like this.
[48:52.39]Like the triangle sandwiches at a party.
[48:55.10]Did you know that all sandwiches can be triangles if you just cut them the right way in half?
[48:59.93]Yeah, but that's fine, but I'm saying I like when it's that style.
[49:04.43]I did not preface that by saying all sandwiches are triangles.
[49:07.92]Yeah, but you said I love this kind of sandwich.
[49:11.64]You could have that every time.
[49:13.36]Yeah, but it's kind of a pain in the ass.
[49:17.32]Sandwiches do taste better if you cut them in half, though.
[49:20.33]Did I hit you?
[49:23.53]No.
[49:27.26]They're very good.
[49:27.84]I love sandwiches.
[49:28.56]Sandwiches are probably one of my top three.
[49:35.37]What are you doing?
[49:35.81]You're still over there.
[49:42.23]I can't see what's going on behind me.
[49:43.99]I just know that you're in some trouble.
[49:48.09]I'm just 1v1ing the strongest blue-collar zombie in the entire game.
[49:53.89]I actually can't get out of this.
[49:55.29]Oh, there we go.
[49:58.27]There is a stamina.
[50:02.54]What are your top sandwich shapes?
[50:05.60]Um, sub roll.
[50:08.04]Probably number one.
[50:10.02]Sure.
[50:11.44]I'd say also up at S tier is... Is a gyro a sandwich?
[50:16.70]Um, yeah, probably.
[50:18.00]Okay, probably for this argument, maybe.
[50:21.28]Well, what are we gonna put our weapons in there?
[50:27.21]We can't like, we have to go through it.
[50:28.57]Oh, we gotta run.
[50:36.02]That's what I was good this game does the thing like an unforgivable survival horror sin, huh?
[50:42.04]Where there's people who you think are not alive.
[50:45.10]Oh my god.
[50:45.68]I got hit me this fucking head with that axe Why am I entire screen go white and blue when that happens?
[50:51.42]What is going on with me?
[50:53.91]But that's when you got hit.
[50:55.71]I don't know what happened.
[50:56.61]I the guy hit me the heaven accident.
[50:58.39]Am I dead?
[50:58.81]Oh
[51:02.93]Are we, like, symbiotically linked or something?
[51:04.85]Why do I feel your pain?
[51:06.21]Because my entire screen flashes white and blue when it happens to you.
[51:09.05]I don't know.
[51:09.45]Are we specific rimming right now?
[51:12.51]Are we getting drift compatible?
[51:16.18]I need to heal.
[51:16.74]I have red.
[51:22.82]I still don't understand what I'm looking at here.
[51:24.56]Okay.
[51:30.56]This is the third try.
[51:32.26]They give you zombies on the ground, but you're not allowed to shoot them until the game lets you.
[51:37.44]Oh, I see what you mean.
[51:38.40]Right.
[51:38.68]The play dead zombies.
[51:40.30]You could in a bunch of other survival horror games.
[51:43.18]If you shoot them, they go and die.
[51:48.64]I feel like we've been watching the trailer for this game the whole time we've been playing.
[51:56.03]I feel like we haven't started playing.
[52:02.88]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[52:06.52]What the fuck?
[52:09.68]That was a fucking hunter from Left 4 Dead.
[52:12.01]I need to eat more of these like pills.
[52:14.49]How much do I have to eat?
[52:32.22]Wait, I have a grenade.
[52:34.80]What's the grenade button again?
[52:35.94]F?
[52:36.98]Okay, watch out.
[52:39.98]Got him.
[52:41.50]What the fuck, dude?
[52:44.89]I'm dead again.
[52:46.17]I think you're shooting me with the shotgun.
[52:48.65]The top bar is your health?
[52:49.95]Watch out, don't shoot me, please.
[52:58.00]Watch out behind you.
[52:59.78]Do I have any more pills?
[53:07.57]You have to hit space so fast during this?
[53:09.61]Just go, go, go, go, go.
[53:10.95]Just go, go, go.
[53:13.99]You alright?
[53:15.01]Yeah, they're just doing like jump scares.
[53:16.85]We're supposed to run.
[53:18.98]There's a police car.
[53:20.10]Let's go.
[53:22.24]Oh, that was a big jumping somersault to make it to the car in time.
[53:27.20]How do I drive?
[53:29.00]Are you sure?
[53:31.43]I'm looking for the keys to the car?
[53:33.43]Yeah, find the keys.
[53:34.31]They're breaking in.
[53:36.37]They're not in the glove box.
[53:38.53]Is this Dora the fucking Explorer?
[53:40.69]Where are they?
[53:44.23]You turn the windshield wipers on.
[53:45.71]Look up, look up.
[53:47.93]Gamers never look up.
[53:52.76]Oh my God.
[53:53.46]I can't help you.
[53:54.42]I am a spectator in this hellscape.
[53:59.63]We drove 10 feet.
[54:03.33]You buckled in?
[54:04.85]Yeah.
[54:05.79]Oh my God.
[54:06.57]Alright, everyone's buckled.
[54:11.72]Can I drive the car?
[54:14.98]I'm like above the middle console right now.
[54:18.76]Made it off campus.
[54:20.39]Now we just got to get through town.
[54:21.95]Without getting killed.
[54:23.09]Made it off campus.
[54:24.05]This is actually like a realistic college simulator.
[54:27.27]It's the RA.
[54:28.93]They know.
[54:30.19]Get me out of this.
[54:34.22]Okay, so that was fun.
[54:35.72]We're dead.
[54:36.32]What are you doing, man?
[54:42.30]Don't put the bong under the covers.
[54:43.90]What if he looks at your bread?
[54:44.90]Helena, are you two alright?
[54:46.11]Alright, hang on, hang on.
[54:47.67]Get in there.
[54:48.84]How do I get out of here?
[54:49.46]And then the really funny thing happens where, like, I took a huge hit from the bong before, like, before... Yeah, I took a huge shit before the RA comes in.
[55:12.79]Oh, my God.
[55:13.19]It's cleaning day.
[55:13.95]It's cleaning day.
[55:15.49]There's a huge shit.
[55:16.35]I can't flush it.
[55:17.29]We have to go.
[55:17.97]You're disgusting.
[55:18.65]Stop it.
[55:20.09]It's like the comedy movie thing where I take a huge bong rip and the RA knock, knock, knock at the door.
[55:25.76]And then I have to hold that in.
[55:27.12]It's like, oh, my God.
[55:29.20]The comedy smoke will come out of my mouth and he'll know.
[55:32.98]And then you do like a huge guffaw like right after they leave.
[55:37.07]Yep.
[55:38.13]I'm fine.
[55:46.12]You stole that joke.
[55:49.07]Okay.
[55:50.69]Every joke is stolen.
[55:51.71]It's called life experience.
[55:52.97]You stole that.
[55:53.39]Matthew Mercer is the voice of Leon here.
[56:07.90]Yeah, it's him.
[56:08.60]It's been confirmed.
[56:09.00]The truth.
[56:09.30]Yeah.
[56:30.35]You gotta have some shades there.
[56:32.21]I hate that when the sun's just beaming through.
[56:33.97]You gotta get the glasses that have both.
[56:35.65]Little flip-ups.
[56:36.59]Holy shit, it would suck to be in this room.
[56:38.88]Yeah, honestly, they need to fix the electricity in the White House.
[56:42.38]This is unacceptable.
[56:43.02]Natural lighting only.
[56:56.42]I've always valued your friendship.
[56:57.90]He's old enough, but he would definitely be one of those, like, turn the lights on or you're gonna, like, burn your eyes out trying to read that book.
[57:05.94]You know how my fucking dad stopped?
[57:10.49]Natural lighting is based.
[57:11.53]It's gonna be a tough road.
[57:13.13]Yeah, that's what every magazine told you.
[57:14.99]And then you actually have it, and once you get so much natural light into a room, like, your head hurts.
[57:22.03]Let's get moving.
[57:23.21]We don't have much time.
[57:25.23]certainly got our work cut out for us oh halogen lamps only I know except no I'm not those either fluorescents I I have just like those you know those like fluorescent bulbs like the long tubes yeah you know the ones that go yeah those are all of my whole horror movie lights yep
[57:51.89]I like my house to maintain the abandoned warehouse look.
[57:56.11]So I know exactly what you mean.
[57:58.13]Actually, I need heals.
[58:01.70]Oh, hold on.
[58:02.32]I think I figured it out.
[58:04.22]So... The number of the dots that are on the herb is how many times you can take the pill.
[58:12.06]Right?
[58:13.14]Is it?
[58:13.84]I think that's what that means.
[58:15.76]He finally gets it.
[58:18.54]This is a dumb feature.
[58:20.70]Yeah.
[58:21.52]Like, okay.
[58:22.08]The number at the bottom right with the green leaf.
[58:24.32]What's your number?
[58:25.30]Zero.
[58:26.73]I have nine.
[58:27.63]You do?
[58:27.87]Uh-huh.
[58:28.89]Can I have one?
[58:31.05]Yeah.
[58:33.39]Can we actually trade or no?
[58:35.97]I was about to unload the whole clip into your head.
[58:37.49]Alright.
[58:38.82]We need to go to the cathedral.
[58:45.08]Taking the train to church?
[58:46.54]There is no sprint.
[58:50.17]Yeah, you're right.
[58:50.77]There's no sprint.
[58:52.49]I'm just like twice as fast as you.
[58:54.25]Deal with that zombie.
[58:55.57]How do I do it?
[58:56.14]What's sprint?
[58:56.94]It's space.
[58:57.68]Why is it space?
[58:58.42]That's right.
[58:58.98]Why is it space?
[58:59.92]Why?
[59:02.26]Why is it space?
[59:04.36]Exactly what I just sounded like.
[59:05.48]And I did that for a funny comedic joke thing.
[59:07.94]So you got it.
[59:08.98]Chat voice.
[59:09.86]Watch out.
[59:10.12]Watch out.
[59:14.79]I gotta save bullets.
[59:16.75]I'm sorry.
[59:18.27]Watch out behind you.
[59:21.33]Watch out.
[59:21.77]Actually, let's just keep going.
[59:23.57]There's no reason to stop.
[59:24.73]There really isn't.
[59:25.37]Alright, how do you heal?
[59:28.05]One.
[59:28.87]It'll take one pill, and you can take... You only heal one pip?
[59:32.69]You heal one pip at a time, and I think you can just spam it.
[59:38.10]There's a train coming, by the way.
[59:39.22]Train's coming!
[59:40.94]Spade plus R!
[59:47.22]I tried.
[59:50.24]I was hitting space and D. Space and R?
[59:53.70]What do you mean R?
[59:54.96]Why is it R?
[59:55.52]That's reload.
[59:56.42]I don't know.
[59:59.07]I don't think I got it either.
[60:00.17]I think it just clipped you first.
[60:01.51]Space and hold on.
[60:02.71]That's the cannon ending.
[60:04.37]The thing is, isn't space and D dive?
[60:08.95]Why is it space and R?
[60:10.05]Alright, just run.
[60:16.00]How do you tell, like, this story, by the way?
[60:17.77]Like, Leon, the professional zombie hunter.
[60:20.29]Alright, space plus R. I swear to God, I did it.
[60:28.61]I actually did it.
[60:29.53]I don't get it.
[60:31.13]It's because I have the script that's...
[60:35.37]I have to tell that story.
[60:36.45]Helena is a survivor in one of these timelines.
[60:39.80]You go.
[60:40.08]I have to go find your family.
[60:41.68]Oh, okay.
[60:42.50]Well, you do it.
[60:43.80]You do it.
[60:44.44]I did do it.
[60:45.18]I was up against the wall.
[60:46.08]Space and R. I think my script that I have is fucking up this whole thing.
[60:52.70]Okay, space and R. You got the splat joke three times in the script?
[60:56.15]Okay, I got it.
[61:01.05]I was doing, like, space then R. I wasn't doing it at the same exact time.
[61:04.65]I tried to, but... Dying restores your health.
[61:10.98]Oh, shit, it actually does.
[61:12.18]That's a strat.
[61:12.66]There's a zombie dog.
[61:15.60]Where?
[61:16.52]Dead ahead.
[61:19.60]Oh.
[61:23.05]Do we know if it's friendly?
[61:24.87]It's got red eyes.
[61:30.01]He could be barking at somebody behind us.
[61:31.11]I... Okay.
[61:41.35]Oh my... Geez.
[61:43.19]He's probably barking at the train.
[61:44.35]Okay.
[61:49.74]What do we do with the skill point stuff?
[61:53.50]Rainbow, why are you guys doing this?
[61:55.32]They're attacking us.
[61:56.46]It's like a mutated zombie dog.
[62:00.04]I did it.
[62:00.80]I released the pathogen.
[62:02.83]Well, there's something going on here.
[62:05.73]Why are there so many people in the subway?
[62:08.53]Oh, fuck.
[62:08.99]I think I killed that guy.
[62:11.05]Shit.
[62:11.27]What do you mean there's a train?
[62:14.67]Oh, my God.
[62:22.25]Okay.
[62:25.06]I think maybe we could have saved that.
[62:26.70]Alright.
[62:26.90]You have so much health.
[62:27.74]Let me take this one.
[62:31.89]Get high.
[62:32.29]You guys should get high.
[62:33.19]No!
[62:38.03]They want me to be high.
[62:39.65]Like in play.
[62:41.93]But I have sworn that off forever.
[62:43.70]Ever since I couldn't read the analog clock on camera.
[62:51.77]Why is that one on fire?
[62:53.37]I think, uh, yeah.
[62:54.29]I think we have to turn that off.
[62:58.20]Um, what?
[62:59.42]What happened?
[63:00.28]What did I just get hit with?
[63:01.90]They're throwing shit.
[63:02.90]What do you mean they throw shit?
[63:04.76]They just get stuck and then they throw their... Look, he's throwing again.
[63:07.91]He just hit the guy in front of him.
[63:10.41]Well, they're gonna... Don't even waste ammo on the guys in the back.
[63:17.76]Alright.
[63:19.32]I can do that.
[63:19.66]I can do that.
[63:20.08]I can do cool stuff too.
[63:21.48]I'm just trying to conserve ammo because I'm terrible.
[63:24.58]Oh, you can.
[63:25.24]So if they have a weapon, you do it for your melee finish move.
[63:29.55]I want to carry it around.
[63:30.89]So how do we... I'm so sorry.
[63:32.83]How do we turn that off?
[63:33.65]I thought that was in the game.
[63:35.25]That wasn't in the game.
[63:36.23]That was a coffee-like hiccup.
[63:38.79]I think I... Did we destroy it?
[63:42.08]I can't tell.
[63:42.48]I don't know.
[63:44.10]Co-op moment up here.
[63:45.19]Can I reach this with the range, I think?
[63:47.55]Yeah, I can.
[63:57.85]I don't know why I don't know this about this game.
[63:59.37]I feel like we're still not playing the game yet.
[64:02.21]That's probably because we did not see the prologue or the first cutscene.
[64:05.65]Is that an explode?
[64:06.21]It's a red barrel.
[64:07.05]No.
[64:12.00]See, look.
[64:12.54]This is a pretend zombie over on the wall.
[64:15.26]Yeah, I know.
[64:15.78]We can't shoot him.
[64:17.36]You're right.
[64:18.62]Yeah, that's stupid.
[64:24.10]Was there anything in this?
[64:24.92]No.
[64:25.70]Yeah, I had something.
[64:28.64]Use your knife so you don't waste bullets.
[64:30.78]I don't have a knife.
[64:33.08]I have... Okay, come on.
[64:35.16]Are there items here for you?
[64:37.26]Yeah.
[64:37.97]Okay, so we do both get our own stuff.
[64:44.45]Is there a train here?
[64:45.41]You go first.
[64:47.37]It is a rail.
[64:48.63]Yeah, but I don't know if it's going to be an immediate... Oh, there's a secret!
[64:52.05]Is there?
[64:52.27]Don't worry, I got it.
[64:55.95]I got this.
[64:58.94]Alright, so we're 100%ing this, or else... How many gift subs?
[65:04.26]Um... Zero.
[65:10.40]Careful.
[65:12.01]Okay, I'll give you, uh... I'll give you zero gift subs if you just see how far you can get over the electricity.
[65:18.17]No, no gift subs.
[65:20.35]No gift subs.
[65:21.29]That was the point.
[65:21.77]Yeah, I said zero.
[65:25.66]Uh, shadows.
[65:28.36]Do you have grenades?
[65:30.52]Uh, I don't.
[65:31.06]Some of them are moving inhumanly fast.
[65:33.18]I mean, even for, like, zombies.
[65:35.52]Here they are.
[65:35.94]Alright, is there a barrel?
[65:36.96]Does that explode?
[65:37.50]Alright, I think we just have to run.
[65:42.01]Take out the first.
[65:42.91]Yeah, just run, just run, run, run, run.
[65:49.07]They are really good at predicting movement.
[65:52.01]Are you good?
[65:54.27]Oh, you don't look good.
[65:55.57]Are you good?
[65:56.25]Hold tight for a sec.
[65:58.97]I just did a roundhouse kick.
[66:00.15]I'm good.
[66:02.18]Are you good?
[66:02.98]I'm good.
[66:03.20]I'm just waiting.
[66:05.26]You're almost grumpy.
[66:05.94]I'm not grumpy.
[66:06.46]What are you talking about?
[66:07.14]I'm happy right now.
[66:08.38]Train coming, train coming.
[66:09.32]Which way?
[66:09.64]Which direction?
[66:11.31]It's behind us!
[66:12.01]It's behind us!
[66:13.01]It's behind us!
[66:14.16]I didn't get a prompt!
[66:15.28]What?
[66:16.36]I think you have to be looking at it.
[66:18.26]Or, no, you have to be on the other side of the track.
[66:20.00]There's two tracks.
[66:21.14]Where's the prompt?
[66:22.66]Oh.
[66:28.95]We didn't get a prompt.
[66:30.75]It's been giving us prompts.
[66:32.01]Whatever.
[66:34.43]I was sitting there waiting with... I was... Okay.
[66:36.93]I was hovering... Final destination train.
[66:38.75]I was hovering my hand over space and R just ready to press it.
[66:42.48]Yeah, and I was too.
[66:43.14]You're not going to get the collectible again?
[66:45.72]Not even a real gamer.
[66:46.80]Oh, I thought we shared that.
[66:47.76]Okay.
[66:53.57]So now we just have to go to the other side.
[66:56.71]Yeah.
[66:56.87]So just who cares?
[66:57.41]It's going to do the dumb puppet show where it shows those scary things and we just run by it.
[67:03.97]This is a nightmare.
[67:09.46]I keep having this vision of you getting splattered by a train at high speed.
[67:14.70]Train's on the other side.
[67:16.50]Yep.
[67:19.04]It's definitely going to switch, so just stay in the middle.
[67:31.64]What happened?
[67:32.54]Why?
[67:33.22]I think you got caught in between the cars.
[67:35.46]I did not.
[67:37.22]You went into the middle prematurely.
[67:41.27]Hold on.
[67:42.61]Too much air just came out of my fucking mouth.
[67:44.93]That was so stupid.
[67:48.49]Honest to God, I'm not... What happened?
[67:50.87]I did not even come close.
[67:53.25]The train was already by, dude.
[67:54.75]I swear to God.
[67:55.57]It was like over halfway by.
[68:02.23]This game sucks.
[68:07.79]It's the cutscene trigger.
[68:12.19]But I did not understand the cutscene trigger was going to be here.
[68:16.11]Right on the edge.
[68:17.41]No, dude.
[68:20.06]The hitbox is huge.
[68:21.80]I'm telling you.
[68:22.48]Just stay really far to the left.
[68:24.30]The hitbox is monumental.
[68:27.94]I want to know what it looks like when I get hit by the train.
[68:30.62]You might see it because the hitbox is huge.
[68:41.07]Okay.
[68:42.51]Now we can just... I thought it was going to happen again.
[68:45.99]I thought it happened to you.
[68:46.83]Apparently this is our ride.
[68:51.37]Okay.
[68:52.76]Very good.
[69:00.22]Can't open it?
[69:01.28]We're not getting that open.
[69:03.06]There's an illuminated latch on top.
[69:06.39]Boost me up on top.
[69:07.39]Somebody just said, I've got stuck at this part for 45 minutes.
[69:09.89]Good luck.
[69:10.57]I can't wait.
[69:13.03]Ow, that hurt.
[69:14.43]What the hell?
[69:15.40]Did I shoot you?
[69:16.56]Yeah, directly in the fucking back of the head.
[69:20.24]Ow.
[69:20.40]The shotgun spread is insane.
[69:25.80]Also, I can't believe Friendly Fire is on by default.
[69:28.00]Okay.
[69:28.62]Are you going to boost me?
[69:30.46]Hold on.
[69:31.47]I hate this inventory.
[69:32.59]It sucks.
[69:34.77]Okay, so click on this.
[69:37.11]Say send to... How do I send this to my... You send it to the desktop, and then you're going to want to right-click, zip it, and then email it to me.
[69:44.53]But how do I do that?
[69:48.85]You're a hater.
[69:50.72]I hate this game.
[69:52.02]Yes.
[69:52.20]Yes.
[69:58.50]It's space?
[69:59.26]Okay.
[70:00.80]How do I get up?
[70:03.00]I'm not grumpy.
[70:03.94]I hate this game.
[70:05.00]There's a difference.
[70:06.32]I'm just kidding.
[70:06.79]I like this game.
[70:07.43]Okay, so there's... Why can I not send this to my inventory?
[70:11.11]Okay, hold on.
[70:11.61]It doesn't say I have one heal.
[70:20.11]Mannequins that are deathly come to life.
[70:24.56]Did I just use keys?
[70:26.12]I think I have to wait for you.
[70:28.11]Yeah, it's open.
[70:28.47]I got attacked as soon as I dropped in.
[70:30.43]Keep your guard up.
[70:30.99]Oh nice.
[70:33.27]Here comes a rage stream.
[70:40.77]Watch out.
[70:48.22]Maybe those ones are actually dead.
[70:55.03]I tell you guys that somebody said that they heard that in a game.
[70:59.42]And they like freaked out.
[71:01.04]That sound.
[71:01.60]They heard that sound that I always do.
[71:03.28]And they were like, it fucking ruined the whole game for me.
[71:05.24]I couldn't even play it again.
[71:06.62]What, quiet screaming?
[71:08.16]No, the... Why would you tell me that?
[71:15.78]Was that the whole story?
[71:16.85]Someone played a game, they heard that noise and didn't play it again.
[71:19.99]Yes.
[71:21.87]No, why would you tell me that?
[71:23.97]I'm talking to all of you.
[71:25.15]You're not the only person here at Talos.
[71:33.70]There's like 150,000 other people here.
[71:35.50]Oh, these ones woke up.
[71:38.88]Watch out, watch out.
[71:39.60]They like the meltdown animation.
[71:47.33]The sludge zombie.
[71:49.13]Yeah, that's crazy.
[71:54.77]Be careful.
[71:55.13]I need a minute.
[71:57.57]What are you guys talking about?
[71:59.75]Is this a raid?
[72:02.13]Are you lying to me?
[72:02.77]That's probably the most realistic bit about this game.
[72:04.79]You have to do everything on your phone.
[72:06.24]Is there actually a raid?
[72:06.98]I can't see it.
[72:09.88]Mod, tell me.
[72:11.72]Is it a raid?
[72:14.10]You know, that actually looks like... God, who is that?
[72:19.27]Actual raid right now.
[72:20.41]I need a mod.
[72:21.11]Blade Runner 2049.
[72:24.27]La La Land.
[72:25.11]Raided?
[72:25.74]I don't know.
[72:27.94]I don't think there was.
[72:28.74]That's Ryan Gosling.
[72:30.58]That's alright.
[72:32.14]I got lied to.
[72:33.72]Tell me that's not Ryan Gosling.
[72:37.69]I see Jared Leto more than Ryan Gosling.
[72:40.45]Yeah, I see that too.
[72:42.83]It's the hair and the mustache.
[72:44.65]But the face is Ryan Gosling.
[72:47.32]What the fuck happened?
[72:49.82]They're just gaslighting you.
[73:01.79]Okay.
[73:04.25]That is my name, yeah.
[73:08.43]I swear to God, this is gonna turn on, isn't it?
[73:12.11]Are you ready?
[73:12.77]I'm ready for space R. The train's not turning on.
[73:15.91]I mean, it's on.
[73:17.59]No, we're just going to have... This is actually the Matrix subway station.
[73:23.50]So you got to do... The backwards dive.
[73:26.88]I hate that.
[73:27.58]That's a person, right?
[73:31.98]I feel like I fell asleep on the couch like this last night.
[73:34.59]And that's like my whole body hurts now.
[73:36.21]This is how I slept.
[73:37.27]I hate that.
[73:39.77]I feel like I fell asleep before the stream.
[73:41.99]Woke up and I'm like...
[73:44.11]Like you said, there's no chapter.
[73:47.11]It's got like a bomb.
[73:48.11]We're in like an extended trailer for this game.
[73:52.72]How do you switch to bomb?
[73:55.40]It's a weird combination in the inventory.
[73:57.26]I have no idea.
[73:58.68]Because I can see it from mouse wheel.
[74:00.26]It's like E then like F or something.
[74:03.84]E. E. You can throw it away, so be careful.
[74:10.30]There's literally a way to destroy it.
[74:12.35]Oh, okay.
[74:14.17]It's F and then F, F. Oh, my God.
[74:18.87]This sucks, asshole.
[74:22.09]F is scroll vertically and... What did you just do?
[74:25.47]You just put down... Get away.
[74:27.21]Don't you dare.
[74:29.41]Don't do it.
[74:31.14]Well, can you pick it back up?
[74:32.48]Just pick it back up.
[74:34.74]It's fine as long as you don't press the button.
[74:36.14]My, like, death reflex may accidentally trigger the bomb, but you don't know that.
[74:45.04]Alright, he's dead.
[74:45.54]I'm fine.
[74:47.10]No, now you have to heal.
[74:48.05]We're on veteran right now.
[74:49.49]No, you can't do, like, comedy references.
[74:53.77]Hold on.
[74:54.13]It's okay.
[74:54.43]I got some... Hey!
[74:58.89]Hey!
[74:59.01]I need you to open this door!
[75:01.11]What?
[75:01.41]Hurry!
[75:01.61]I have to see Peter!
[75:03.80]Please!
[75:04.26]Oh.
[75:04.48]I have to see Peter.
[75:05.58]I'll never get to the cathedral at this rate.
[75:06.98]I thought that was part of the cutscene.
[75:08.34]Come on.
[75:08.88]We gotta get her out of there.
[75:11.60]Come on.
[75:11.76]We're gonna pull this open with our bare hands.
[75:13.92]I can't open it!
[75:19.12]Oh, you idiot.
[75:20.40]You idiot.
[75:21.62]You idiot.
[75:25.58]Use a bomb.
[75:28.62]I didn't mean to use that many.
[75:31.38]Use a bomb.
[75:31.66]Yeah, use a bomb.
[75:32.86]Somebody just threw something in my face.
[75:36.04]Watch out.
[75:36.36]Watch out.
[75:36.68]Plant a bomb.
[75:37.44]Alright, watch out.
[75:38.10]Yep.
[75:46.61]I didn't even see it!
[75:47.65]Ugh.
[75:48.61]Cool guys don't look at explosions.
[75:49.93]I saw it, though.
[75:50.65]It's very cool.
[75:52.09]They're alive?
[76:06.09]Alright, the worst part is switching guns.
[76:08.25]The entire gun inventory, like, crosses over the crosshair.
[76:14.91]Like, if you mouse wheel while you're aiming down sights?
[76:18.45]I mean, you can just say it.
[76:20.33]You can just say it.
[76:22.07]This game is actually not as bad as everyone said it was.
[76:26.49]It's awful, but I would not give this an F. I'd give it, like, a D so far.
[76:30.53]It's awful, but, like, does it... I would never... I would never recommend this game to my friends, but, like, if somebody... Yeah.
[76:41.33]As far as, like, co-op games, though, there's just a lot of... What are conditions like up there?
[76:48.12]It's the worst Resident Evil game.
[76:49.34]If you were playing this by yourself, you'd be... This is not a game I would play solo Resident Evil.
[76:56.44]Oh, let me turn you up.
[76:57.76]But, like, that?
[77:00.16]A person using the turnstile and then just leaping.
[77:02.70]Yeah, it's fucked up.
[77:05.86]That's good content.
[77:08.06]I have no idea.
[77:08.56]I don't even know what you just said.
[77:09.48]I just said that's fucked up after what you said because I wasn't paying any attention.
[77:12.26]I thought you were talking about like the zombies or whatever.
[77:13.82]I was trying to fill dead air while you were in the settings again.
[77:15.90]I did the thing where you're like on the phone and like you're just talking to somebody and you're like that's fucked up.
[77:21.28]And you don't even know the last sentence they said.
[77:22.98]I was talking about diapers.
[77:27.20]It's fucked up.
[77:29.74]It's crazy.
[77:32.31]What the fuck, dude?
[77:33.31]Save him!
[77:41.43]Whoa.
[77:44.57]You can continue on, I guess.
[77:47.25]Did I punch you again?
[77:48.66]Yes.
[77:50.56]Shoot the thing on the back.
[77:51.32]Shoot his back.
[77:56.90]Oh, a bishop.
[77:58.38]Thanks.
[78:00.70]Helena, car!
[78:03.33]Space R!
[78:04.29]Holy shit.
[78:05.89]Okay, I'm good.
[78:07.01]I feel like this is just the tip of the iceberg.
[78:10.41]I have a bad feeling about this.
[78:11.85]Okay, those are not zombies.
[78:14.59]Get out of here, dude.
[78:15.87]Run!
[78:18.47]Why are you just waiting for one of them to do the thing where they're running and holding the asshole like they're going to shit their pants?
[78:24.21]Okay, I haven't heard that reference in like four years.
[78:27.26]Just like walking really quickly, holding your butt, shitting your pants.
[78:34.52]These are just two people who lock themselves out of the trunk.
[78:39.72]And why the fuck does that happen?
[78:41.60]In any movie or TV show?
[78:42.72]You know what I'm talking about?
[78:43.54]Like, why is it like a funny reference?
[78:44.94]Nobody like does like the quick walk holding butt.
[78:47.84]I've never seen anybody do that.
[78:51.72]You gotta be the... The visionary.
[78:57.74]What is... This game's fucking broken.
[78:59.14]Just keep going.
[79:01.52]You weren't allowed to shoot them yet.
[79:02.93]They were doing the cinematic thing.
[79:05.24]We gotta help this guy.
[79:06.80]Oh, yeah.
[79:07.68]What a fu- This is GTA.
[79:09.38]That was a stream sniper.
[79:13.00]What the fuck?
[79:13.32]We need ammo and shit though, dude.
[79:33.56]Yeah, so that's why they... First of all, there's a military zombie with, like, an assault rifle, and they are shooting at us.
[79:38.73]This is too loud.
[79:39.45]Everyone always asks why my... The zombies have guns now in there.
[79:43.57]Oh, the zombies have guns.
[79:44.61]That's what it was.
[79:45.47]That's why everybody hates this game, I remember.
[79:48.18]You climb first.
[79:49.24]I always have the game really quiet, because it's easy to pay attention.
[79:52.00]I feel like my game is loud.
[79:53.62]I think my game is a little too loud.
[79:56.34]Oh, the audio is good.
[79:57.00]Oh, perfect.
[79:57.60]Do you have a bomb?
[79:58.87]Uh, I have...
[80:02.36]I don't know okay I have one bomb you want to put it down there your turn no no you just gotta jump across okay I couldn't put it down there well let's see if I can kill them they didn't work it did hurt me though why did you have a cutscene I didn't you just kind of like left across
[80:30.50]Alright, that was... Alright.
[80:35.40]What's wrong with my camera?
[80:42.44]I'm like permanently left-handed in this game because my camera gets reset every time we do a co-op moment.
[80:48.72]Are you hitting caps lock?
[80:50.62]We gotta run.
[80:53.91]Run.
[80:55.07]This way.
[80:56.49]Okay.
[81:00.96]Ron.
[81:02.82]Ron?
[81:03.38]Do you know that guy?
[81:06.16]That's fine.
[81:06.86]We're good.
[81:12.06]What the fuck is happening?
[81:13.06]I didn't even want to do that.
[81:14.16]Get up the ladder.
[81:14.96]Artists spend a lot of time on these custom kills.
[81:25.19]Who got that there?
[81:26.45]How did that get in there?
[81:27.47]I don't know.
[81:27.83]We just fucked up somebody's car.
[81:31.79]Go!
[81:32.41]What the fuck is happening to me?
[81:35.21]What's going on?
[81:35.95]I just got lit up through the grate?
[81:38.39]I can't move.
[81:39.09]I don't even understand what just happened.
[81:41.68]Why can't we get- Oh.
[81:44.50]That guy.
[81:46.64]Go!
[81:50.18]Now where?
[81:50.52]Over here?
[81:50.80]Okay.
[81:57.91]They were opening the new like path for us.
[82:00.89]I guess we're not going that way.
[82:05.26]How Leon is so cool.
[82:07.08]He's so cool.
[82:09.90]No, it looks like this way is blocked.
[82:12.58]They're always so cool.
[82:13.94]A family of three just died.
[82:15.88]I guess we're not going that way as much as possible.
[82:18.98]Maybe we can even catch our breath.
[82:22.03]We have to hurry.
[82:24.21]I'd be kind of cool if you could.
[82:26.67]I'd be really happy about that.
[82:28.36]They should make Resident Evil games like minigame games.
[82:32.86]It should be a Resident Evil party game.
[82:35.04]Like Mario Party.
[82:38.42]What about Resident Evil like soccer?
[82:40.08]That would be kind of cool.
[82:44.60]You can shoot them?
[82:45.86]What do you mean?
[82:46.28]Shoot what?
[82:49.56]I don't know.
[82:49.98]What are you referring to?
[82:53.70]Somebody was saying... I talked to the people over here in my brain.
[83:00.30]the pool balls oh you can shoot the pool balls do they do they do anything they're saying that it does oh my god it works okay so here's the thing I got it my ball point oh I was gonna we're gonna call balls and
[83:20.49]Yeah, but if you play pool, the person, if you get it, like, I got solids.
[83:25.98]I got the first one.
[83:26.96]Yeah, which is really stupid, by the way.
[83:29.00]That means that somebody can just literally win, and I don't even get to play.
[83:32.80]Now I got to get the eight ball.
[83:37.56]If you get good at pool, you can get to the point where you physically don't allow the other person to play.
[83:41.63]I should have just bet you something for that one, because that was pretty good.
[83:45.77]Wait, were you seeing pool balls different?
[83:47.55]Stop tripping over there.
[83:48.37]Okay, never mind.
[83:48.87]Let's go.
[83:49.45]Oh, what was that?
[83:50.65]Hold on.
[83:51.01]I want to hear that again.
[83:53.73]You said something very specific.
[83:55.57]Are you guys alive?
[84:01.34]Is it a gun?
[84:01.76]Flying side pool.
[84:06.10]Uh...
[84:17.24]Where'd he go?
[84:17.54]Don't worry.
[84:17.82]I'll go.
[84:18.18]It's too scary in here.
[84:19.05]I'll go.
[84:20.61]Wait, these people just walk- Oh, I thought they were alive.
[84:23.77]Yeah, I was gonna say they're not even zombies.
[84:26.35]They are.
[84:26.89]They're gonna stand up.
[84:28.27]There's one behind us.
[84:31.39]It's gonna change to our Twitch channels and they're gonna get up and fucking flip out.
[84:36.53]Demand it to be changed.
[84:41.62]No, these are people already watching our Twitch channels.
[84:43.94]This is just what they look like.
[84:46.54]Oh.
[84:55.83]What?
[84:56.39]No.
[84:59.00]The entire city is on fire.
[85:01.24]What?
[85:01.52]I hate that so much.
[85:04.50]So wait, do we both get this?
[85:06.06]Excuse me.
[85:06.28]What do you mean it's locked?
[85:09.44]Find the key.
[85:10.92]Kick it open.
[85:12.98]So where's the key?
[85:13.90]Oh, you have to carefully reach to grab the key and then not get grabbed.
[85:20.23]You want to grab key?
[85:21.57]I'll be ready.
[85:21.99]Yeah, I'll do it.
[85:23.91]Tell me when you get it.
[85:25.97]I'm going in for the sparkle.
[85:30.35]I have become afraid.
[85:31.75]We picked the wrong person to be worried about.
[85:38.33]Alright.
[85:43.82]We're good.
[85:47.28]I have the key.
[85:47.94]There wasn't even an animation for me grabbing it.
[85:53.15]Oh, come on.
[85:54.01]This stupid game.
[85:56.53]Of course, like you said, they are not real until the game decides they are.
[86:00.85]Uh-huh.
[86:04.15]Are you healthy?
[86:04.69]Are you good?
[86:05.45]I'm not okay.
[86:07.83]I need help.
[86:08.33]You want to talk about it?
[86:09.84]I need to talk about you having healing potions to give me.
[86:14.00]I have four.
[86:15.32]Ooh, a shotgun.
[86:16.38]Nope, mine.
[86:18.10]Oh, you got it too?
[86:18.72]That's not cool anymore.
[86:19.50]I want my other one back.
[86:21.15]You have two shotguns?
[86:22.55]I do have two now, yeah.
[86:24.25]Oh, that's kind of convenient.
[86:25.35]I think we got the same one.
[86:27.37]I got like a triple barrel with no stock and then the tactical one that we just got.
[86:33.18]I'm sorry.
[86:33.84]I can't hear a thing you're saying.
[86:34.84]I'm a little screaming.
[86:37.86]Okay.
[86:38.56]I want to use this.
[86:41.38]Combine with my backpack.
[86:45.74]Eat.
[86:49.07]Only one heal.
[86:49.95]That sucks.
[86:54.85]Oh, this door's locked.
[86:56.89]Find the house key.
[86:57.79]Oh, this metal door's locked.
[86:59.29]Kick it open.
[86:59.59]Are there bosses?
[87:00.47]Is this a boss?
[87:01.93]It's Resident Evil.
[87:06.53]You have to mix it with another herb.
[87:09.64]Alright, let's see.
[87:10.48]Uh-huh.
[87:10.82]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[87:14.02]He's just afraid of us.
[87:15.54]I got him.
[87:16.22]Watch out.
[87:16.56]That guy's gonna bomb.
[87:20.38]They're coming in behind.
[87:22.04]Behind us!
[87:24.56]Why can't we just shut the door?
[87:28.54]The guy's fucking head.
[87:33.32]Wait!
[87:33.80]I'm just gonna play through the rest of the game like this.
[87:36.73]What are you- Why can I not trip over you?
[87:40.93]That's the weird thing.
[87:45.73]Are there different- Okay, is it just red and green herbs?
[87:48.33]Or is there more?
[87:49.65]Uh, I've only seen the two so far.
[87:51.81]The turkey's over here, wherever it is.
[87:55.28]Uh, he's gonna explode.
[87:56.06]Yeah, I'm not going near that.
[87:59.48]He didn't... He didn't explode.
[88:01.12]That was anticlimactic.
[88:02.36]Yes, red and green.
[88:03.24]He actually became... He became a trophy.
[88:05.43]We have skills.
[88:06.05]Hey.
[88:09.83]Green, alright.
[88:14.89]I gotta... We need to do a skill thing here.
[88:17.19]It hasn't been a quiet moment to really do anything.
[88:20.17]It's just been like constant conflict.
[88:22.63]Are you playing House of the Dead?
[88:24.90]It kind of does have that vibe, doesn't it?
[88:26.68]It does, yeah.
[88:28.16]It even has the game over when one partner dies.
[88:31.48]Repeatedly.
[88:32.34]Oh, we got- That is absolutely a red barrel.
[88:34.68]I'm ready for it.
[88:37.13]You- What are you- Why would- I don't understand why you would do that.
[88:39.35]That's- You were this close to saying you fuck.
[88:41.21]You were this close.
[88:42.47]But that was not- There was nothing funny about that.
[88:44.93]You just ruined our experience.
[88:48.09]No, no, no.
[88:48.37]You just ruined my experience because I wanted to shoot that and kill some people.
[88:55.67]You just ruined my experience.
[88:57.51]No one's even there.
[88:58.73]We're not even going to be over there.
[89:02.13]It's not how that works.
[89:02.87]Very strong.
[89:05.06]Alright, so you just jump down.
[89:07.24]Look at what would have been right there too.
[89:09.78]That would have been great.
[89:12.28]Are you supposed to be doing something?
[89:14.02]Yeah, I'm doing it.
[89:14.50]You just got to stay alive.
[89:17.23]I'm pushing this giant heap of trash as fast as I can and I don't need the video game.
[89:25.07]I'm the guy with no ammo and no health and I'm the one that has to take care of this.
[89:32.85]Can I go now?
[89:37.55]No, I'm still looking for an exit.
[89:39.89]I'm actually just going to leave you behind.
[89:41.15]That guy got cracked.
[89:42.74]What?
[89:48.22]I'm waiting for you currently to do a co-op moment.
[89:50.91]What?
[89:51.85]I can't even get down the stairs.
[89:52.87]How are you waiting for a co-op?
[89:54.59]How am I supposed to free you?

[90:11.70]Okay.
[90:12.10]Now you really got to help me.
[90:13.62]Okay, I'm coming.
[90:18.09]Oh, I can heal you with the number one instead of pushing V. I've apparently been choosing not to heal you.
[90:24.01]What is... Okay.
[90:30.01]I'm gonna run.
[90:30.49]Do I have any heals?
[90:36.12]No, I'm not gonna combine this.
[90:39.74]Oh, God.
[90:43.50]Why is V back?
[90:45.24]Ugh.
[90:45.36]Ugh.
[90:49.30]Two green.
[90:49.98]No, I want to do green and red.
[90:51.83]Just do it.
[90:52.55]I want green and red, though.
[90:55.17]I want green and red, Starburst.
[90:56.81]I do.
[90:57.79]Those are the best ones.
[90:59.15]It's only three.
[90:59.91]What the fuck?
[91:00.47]Why do you look like you're passing out right now?
[91:02.37]Because I probably am.
[91:04.49]Your hands are on your knees.
[91:07.51]You're holding your gut.
[91:12.21]Don't call me menu, Andy.
[91:16.74]These guys really take a lot.
[91:17.68]They pop a lot of pills.
[91:27.76]Are these survivors?
[91:29.32]Is this humanity's best?
[91:30.20]What the fuck?
[91:32.58]That was the only non... That was the only NPC in the whole goddamn group.
[91:42.14]Boo, he's standing in front of me on purpose.
[91:47.43]Watch out!
[91:51.33]The guy on top of the truck.
[91:52.77]We have to shoot his growth.
[91:57.41]Oh, yeah.
[91:58.45]You already killed him in four bullets.
[92:00.82]And then he screams.
[92:01.80]And then what happens?
[92:02.88]I think we get more.
[92:05.48]What the hell?
[92:07.58]uh I'm dead I guess that ambulance came out of nowhere and rammed directly into me that was go that car was going 80 miles per hour that was not even like 30. that car was going 100 miles can an ambulance even go like 150 miles per hour alright this time we're gonna get this right come on we have to help him deus ex drivers
[92:41.81]It's actually easier to be on the ground.
[92:43.03]Alright, so... Wait, were you not on the ground?
[92:46.61]It's easier to lie on the ground and shoot.
[92:49.17]Okay, but watch out for the, uh... Oh, please, really?
[92:53.17]Okay, did that hurt my brain?
[93:04.06]Oh, he screams at us.

[93:19.42]Yeah, it is going like... I thought I was going to be out of the way.
[93:26.89]Go.
[93:28.45]Just stand over here.
[93:30.85]There's no reason to be in that direction.
[93:40.12]Yeah, we don't need to save these people.
[93:41.52]They're fine.
[93:41.94]Well, we can.
[93:42.42]Keep them apart.
[93:42.78]They're going to get run over by the ambulance too.
[93:45.46]They're going to get ambulanced in like 10 seconds.
[93:48.65]Oh, no.
[93:49.05]They really are.
[93:49.53]Are you kidding me?
[93:52.53]Take that guy out right now.
[93:54.01]He's on top of it right here.
[93:55.47]Oh, fuck off.
[94:02.34]Oh, my God.
[94:03.02]You idiots.
[94:03.86]He'll just get you.
[94:07.67]I want to get all that stuff before the cutscene gets us.
[94:09.25]I want to get... Yeah, let's go.
[94:10.81]Quick.
[94:18.25]Go, go, go, go.
[94:18.95]Get me out.
[94:21.69]What's wrong with my body?
[94:23.72]Here it comes.
[94:24.52]What?
[94:24.96]I wasn't even close.
[94:34.33]I actually wasn't even close.
[94:35.89]I was over near you.
[94:37.23]What the fuck?
[94:41.67]I'm serious.
[94:42.41]I was actually not even close.
[94:49.22]I was over... So bad.
[94:49.90]You know.
[94:50.28]I'm turning on the fucking tryhard right now.
[95:05.94]I always think that's the ambulance.
[95:07.76]I know.
[95:08.20]Alright, fuck that guy.
[95:15.61]Did you see that?
[95:18.63]Watch out, ambulance.
[95:21.57]Ambulance, just go over to the left.
[95:24.34]Okay, my goodness.
[95:26.60]There's more inside.
[95:28.50]And they have body armor.
[95:38.94]He's got guns, too.
[95:44.74]Okay.
[95:45.72]We're good.
[95:48.46]When do we actually pick skills?
[95:50.67]Uh, this is about to be an explosion.
[95:52.21]Shoot the gas?
[95:54.69]Wait, don't shoot it yet.
[95:55.33]We have to do this stuff.
[95:58.17]It's like an Omega thing over here.
[96:05.05]Okay, I'm ready.
[96:06.75]Let's get to a safe distance.
[96:08.69]I don't know, but all the NPCs are over here, so it's definitely this far away.
[96:19.04]We're good.
[96:19.86]I think we're okay.
[96:20.26]Yep.
[96:20.36]I'm walking like I'm injured, but I have full health.
[96:23.80]I think it's stamina.
[96:24.98]Oh, yeah, it is.
[96:34.96]well I think I'm just being dramatic Etalyx we've been playing this game for an hour and a half yeah it's the same level I feel I'm I'm my brain is the same level but also I don't think turning the difficulty down would have stopped the uh one hit train kills no come on man open up you gotta let us in
[97:05.99]I'll just take all of his cool stuff.
[97:15.34]God.
[97:17.66]So, just want to make it really clear.
[97:20.32]We could have just seen an entire Will Ferrell movie.
[97:24.12]It already played.
[97:24.78]Um, probably one of the new ones.
[97:26.08]That's the ones I would have muted.
[97:28.06]Alright, we just have to eliminate enemies.
[97:34.96]Yeah, that's... Did you just read that off the screen?
[97:37.60]I was just making sure we didn't have to go upstairs.
[97:39.99]You never know.
[97:42.19]There's no way to tell.
[97:43.05]Don't worry.
[97:50.43]Somebody doesn't already have this window.
[97:51.81]Hey, there's probably at least three people in one of the chats making some zombies, COD zombies jokes here.
[97:59.01]I just want to say I know who you are.
[98:01.20]At the cola?
[98:01.72]This cola somewhere?
[98:02.44]Did not laugh.
[98:03.80]-2.
[98:10.93]I have the incendiary grenade.
[98:16.07]Oops.
[98:17.67]Oh, I thought he was breaking her neck.
[98:21.85]I thought he was going to get like a snap.
[98:26.47]Um, what the fuck?
[98:29.62]I thought I threw that.
[98:30.96]I had to throw the incendiary.
[98:35.37]I had full health.
[98:36.03]Not anymore.
[98:36.45]Yeah, but I was saving you.
[98:37.45]See, the zombie that was on you died.
[98:41.07]Very funny.
[98:42.82]Very funny.
[98:54.88]These are enemies from Dead Rising.
[98:58.06]That guy had a golf club.
[98:59.08]Watch out!
[99:01.63]They're using clubs, axes, hammers.
[99:06.43]Somebody said, this game feels like mockery.
[99:10.47]Are they like an art critic?
[99:16.29]What?
[99:17.49]He's trying to kill him.
[99:19.81]I think that's the gun shop owner.
[99:23.79]Oh, alright.
[99:26.83]We still have to kill enemies.
[99:30.23]Is the car shooting at us?
[99:35.62]I'm so- I panic.
[99:36.72]Alright, that- that- that zombie's neck just became Stretch Armstrong for a half second.
[99:53.55]And... Yep.
[99:57.61]Why would you wait?
[99:58.59]Was he gonna monolog?
[100:00.51]Oh, it turned into a different animal.
[100:07.47]Peter was my favorite side character.
[100:09.47]But we can go outside.
[100:10.37]Peter was my favorite guy dressed in Summer Sims clothing.
[100:13.77]Watch out.
[100:16.03]He's in.
[100:17.69]Venom is in.
[100:22.56]Is he dead?
[100:22.98]Shoot him in the chest.
[100:30.77]Nice.
[100:33.57]I still have no health.
[100:42.01]Is he dead?
[100:47.31]We should be pretty close.
[100:48.47]Are we alive?
[100:49.39]Are you sure we're not supposed to just leave?
[100:51.05]It says eliminate all enemies.
[100:52.59]It does say that.
[100:54.83]We can go outside.
[100:56.29]I wouldn't if I were you.
[100:59.17]That doesn't sound very safe.
[101:09.75]please tell Etalyx to watch his six I just elbow dropped that zombie please tell what I watch your six okay uh yeah I got I got it when do we get to stop doing this hang on is it is that the like six when you're high or like the six when you're not high what that was an analog clock joke oh oh oh um I probably couldn't even do that right now
[101:41.23]Wait, you had a lockdown button?
[101:44.69]I think I picked everything up off the- Are you alright?
[101:54.60]He said to come up- We have to go upstairs now.
[101:58.08]There's bullets everywhere.
[102:03.18]Do you need help?
[102:09.59]You let me know if you need help.
[102:10.51]Do you need help?
[102:15.57]What are you shooting at?
[102:16.25]Oh, hold on.
[102:16.59]I need to heal.
[102:17.19]I'm going to combine some shit.
[102:21.07]How do you get out of here?
[102:24.56]I like... Okay, so there was a lot of action going on.
[102:27.86]I accidentally alt-tabbed.
[102:29.32]How do I use this?
[102:30.70]And I tab back in and everyone's gone.
[102:32.54]Yeah, we went upstairs.
[102:33.86]Bro!
[102:40.54]Oh, it's this... Ugh.
[102:45.39]Oh, now the door's locked.
[102:46.78]We're safe.
[102:47.22]Okay.
[102:47.78]What the?
[102:48.00]He just started shooting at that guy.
[102:49.36]Oh.
[103:14.36]Get the shutters.
[103:17.10]No.
[103:19.32]What door do I look out from?
[103:21.60]This window right here.
[103:25.61]How?
[103:29.65]Why even shoot the gun?
[103:31.35]They're all going to do it.
[103:32.43]Who's outside with a flashlight?
[103:33.95]Just ran across stage left.
[103:35.66]Somebody is out there with a light.
[103:38.28]I don't see anybody.
[103:38.98]Oh, somebody is out there.
[103:40.18]Who is it?
[103:46.67]This is just the game.
[103:47.53]Okay.
[103:48.57]The game was not made for more than four players, but we modded it and like ruined the whole experience.
[103:54.51]There's one of the big red guys inside.
[103:56.08]It's so loud.
[103:57.58]It is.
[103:57.86]Yeah, I guess.
[104:00.38]It actually would be kind of funny.
[104:01.74]Imagine having 10 people in this room.
[104:06.00]This guy is kicking the shit out of me.
[104:07.88]Please, somebody help me.
[104:08.97]The carnage is attacking me.
[104:10.95]This lady is just... Her AI has stopped working.
[104:14.38]What?
[104:14.94]Are we huddling?
[104:16.12]I don't know who I'm attacking.
[104:23.97]I guess I'm... What the fuck?
[104:29.67]This is so stupid.
[104:30.48]I... I'm dying over on the corner.

[105:13.19]Oh, shit!
[105:15.07]Oh, shit.
[105:15.60]We're okay.
[105:18.50]Finally!
[105:21.16]Oh, this... I don't know.
[105:22.60]This game is not good.
[105:23.44]It's not good at all.
[105:37.20]Were we supposed to do that, or is it just time-based?
[105:39.28]No, I think it's just time-based, but it's like, this is weird.
[105:45.84]We all, don't tell me we have to do that again.
[105:47.52]We have to do it again?
[105:48.34]No, we don't.
[105:53.72]What the fuck?
[105:54.76]I'm just trying to be in my inventory.
[105:58.32]okay okay uh don't just run at him alright alright oh my god
[106:13.49]I'm in the corner.
[106:14.73]I'm not good.
[106:15.35]I'm going to help you up.
[106:17.55]While the giant monster is breathing over us.
[106:20.68]Where is he?
[106:21.20]He just stepped on my head, dude.
[106:23.86]Why does the entire screen just flash white?
[106:26.68]There are too many people in this room for what we're doing.
[106:29.26]This is so stupid.
[106:32.12]I can't even get up.
[106:33.26]I'm just going to drop some remote bombs.
[106:39.53]Why is he running at me?
[106:43.92]In the stomach?
[106:44.42]Lead him back over here.
[106:51.73]It's the guy from Saint's Row.
[106:56.05]Yeah.
[106:56.55]Good work.
[106:57.39]Good work, officer.
[106:58.37]You guys aren't even helping.
[107:00.13]Ah, this shit.
[107:02.45]Frank disconnected.
[107:09.66]We need to add skills.
[107:11.38]I'm stopping right here.
[107:14.18]Where's skill points?
[107:15.28]Equip skills.
[107:16.10]Finally.
[107:16.42]Um.
[107:19.24]What are you?
[107:21.56]I just heard something.
[107:24.92]I got you six.
[107:25.80]Where do you equip skills?
[107:27.84]I think it's between missions.
[107:28.96]This has been the same mission the entire time.
[107:31.30]Okay.
[107:31.82]Hold on.
[107:33.33]Let me combine some stuff.
[107:34.65]I got this.
[107:37.33]So I want to put this in my inventory.
[107:40.71]Okay.
[107:42.57]Shut up.
[107:44.28]Wow.
[107:45.36]Hostile.
[107:48.39]Hang on.
[107:48.61]I'm combining some stuff too.
[107:54.89]There is one mouse wheel scroll between store in case and delete from game.
[108:01.55]Yeah.
[108:01.75]I don't think you've had fun for a single time.
[108:06.57]I think I've been having fun.
[108:08.01]I think we're having a good time.
[108:10.35]Yeah.
[108:10.57]This is the kind of shitty that you have fun with.
[108:12.83]Yeah.
[108:14.92]So we made it outside.
[108:17.98]They're waiting for us.
[108:19.24]Not like Resident Evil 3, which was just shitty.
[108:25.18]Yeah, Resident Evil 3 was pretty bad.
[108:27.68]It just didn't do it for anybody, I don't think.
[108:32.92]This is like watching the Far Cry movie on Netflix.
[108:35.94]We gotta help this guy.
[108:37.68]Nah, let him fall.
[108:38.42]Help him up.
[108:41.84]I'll cover you.
[108:42.90]Oh, watch out.
[108:43.32]Another big guy.
[108:45.75]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[108:48.05]I didn't even want to do that.
[108:49.41]Why did I do that?
[108:50.81]I swear to God, I didn't want to do that.
[108:53.01]Do we both have the exact same plan?
[108:54.89]Yes, we did.
[108:55.49]I think it worked.
[109:01.23]Are you dead?
[109:01.67]Wait, where are you?
[109:02.27]I'm dead.
[109:02.67]You died again?
[109:05.01]Yeah, I did.
[109:05.85]Have a Tic Tac.
[109:09.73]Yeah, I keep eating your Tic Tacs.
[109:15.05]Honest to fucking God.
[109:16.13]Why are you going through?
[109:17.25]There's 10 people.
[109:18.47]Is this a bit?
[109:19.33]No, there's 10 people here.
[109:21.45]Why do you have to attack me?
[109:22.45]I was all the way in the back.
[109:24.65]Are you sure you're not doing like a see how long it takes to notice that he's the only one shooting zombies?
[109:29.06]No.
[109:35.68]Oh my God.
[109:37.36]Please.
[109:44.44]I'm gonna die.
[109:45.22]It's bad.
[109:45.68]I'm gonna die.
[109:47.01]I'm lying on the ground.
[109:48.77]Just one more of those.
[109:52.41]I'm the dick that keeps asking you for Tic Tacs and you only have like a few left and you don't want to give me all of them.
[109:59.49]Hey, can I borrow a pencil?
[110:00.77]Hey, you have any gum?
[110:03.40]Can we go?
[110:03.76]I know you have two pieces of gum left and I've asked for two.
[110:17.51]Alright, let's get out of here.
[110:20.77]I'm gonna fucking kiss.
[110:23.07]Go to the bus.
[110:24.22]Get to the bus.
[110:34.74]They've been waiting for us down here.
[110:42.05]Is the bus driver a new character?
[110:45.43]Well, you can tell this game takes place in New York because none of these people have their own personal car.
[110:50.25]We're going to take public transportation.
[110:55.50]I'm just going to pretend like I didn't hear that.
[110:58.24]Oh, wait, they're sucking that guy out.
[111:02.06]Why can't I shoot this gun?
[111:09.84]I'm getting...
[111:11.72]You're dead?
[111:12.54]No, I'm not.
[111:13.48]I'm fine.
[111:17.36]What did I just... Oh, no.
[111:19.19]Oh, no.
[111:27.07]Back up.
[111:28.25]He was so close to me.
[111:31.21]I didn't... Oh, give me a break.
[111:43.76]so excessive we're gonna crash immediately too what's with in horror movies people just driving a straight line into walls that was that was one mission what was your accuracy 64 oh I was 79. well hold on that's because you had a shotgun rank a
[112:03.69]You had a shotgun from the very beginning, which means you don't even have to fucking aim.
[112:07.76]I had a pistol from the beginning.
[112:09.32]First hour was skewed.
[112:10.40]You had three times as many pistols as I did.
[112:12.30]That doesn't matter.
[112:12.85]Your shotgun will hit something.
[112:14.91]I have to actually pinpoint the laser on people's heads.
[112:18.91]That's unfair.
[112:19.79]In fact, I think that mine's probably better than yours.
[112:21.71]Okay, but that doesn't explain the extra nine enemies routed.
[112:25.69]End game?
[112:26.15]Which, by the way, can we just stop for a second and acknowledge that we apparently killed, I assume, 457 enemies in one mission?
[112:37.95]Am I doing the math right there?
[112:39.65]Yeah, that's a lot.
[112:41.31]That seems like a lot.
[112:42.77]I don't think we did that.
[112:45.87]I don't think we killed more than 30 or 40 people.
[112:49.99]30 or 40?
[112:52.23]Maybe like 50.
[112:52.79]Okay, maybe we're asleep during that.
[112:54.93]Hold on, do we, um... Is this the end?
[113:00.14]There's literally a timer at the top.
[113:01.78]Can you hit, okay.
[113:05.48]Oh, it's a timer for me.
[113:07.28]Oh, we have to make sure we do this right.
[113:09.93]Because I don't want you to have the same thing that I have so we can be different character classes.
[113:13.15]Okay, how many skill points do you have?
[113:16.02]I have 12,700 experience points.
[113:18.66]Alright, so I got 11,300.
[113:19.38]So even though I did more of the work, I got less skill points.
[113:24.01]Well, that just means I did better work.
[113:26.97]Okay, melee level 1.
[113:28.23]Defense lock on level 2.
[113:34.03]Brits.
[113:38.37]Javo killer?
[113:40.33]Slight melee damage is like all points.
[113:45.08]Hmm.
[113:46.50]Two of them are 12,000, so I'm, like, just shy of the big... I think I want crits.
[113:54.02]You can scroll down.
[113:54.77]Oh, shit!
[113:55.27]You can scroll.
[113:57.45]Oh.
[113:59.09]Quick reload?
[114:00.41]Ooh.
[114:01.89]Greatly increases the strength of your final remaining shot.
[114:04.27]I'm not gonna pay attention to that one.
[114:06.17]55!
[114:07.51]Removes your targeting sight, but increases your firepower.
[114:09.90]Ooh, that's cool.
[114:13.56]Break free easily from enemy's grasp?
[114:15.72]Yeah, definitely.
[114:16.86]That seems easy to pick.
[114:18.92]Oh, wait a minute.
[114:19.58]Hold on, dude.
[114:20.18]You only get to have three of these active at once.
[114:22.56]Oh, yeah.
[114:26.22]There's a single player only.
[114:28.06]100 points.
[114:32.96]Okay, hold on.
[114:34.03]Wait, can I do a double?
[114:35.73]No.
[114:39.27]What is team up?
[114:41.63]No, fuck that.
[114:43.49]There's a lot of question marks at the bottom.
[114:45.61]Oh, that's single player only.
[114:46.80]That's what I said.
[114:48.66]Yeah, that's stupid.
[114:51.08]Keeps your partner from helping you.
[114:52.44]Oh, God.
[114:54.58]Like getting in the way?
[114:56.00]We have to pick weapons too.
[114:59.16]Did you already pick your skills?
[115:00.86]I picked breakout, which I feel like was pretty useful.
[115:07.55]Arrow pickup allows you to pick up an increased number of normal and pipe bombs.
[115:13.85]lone wolf field medic team up item drop increase yeah you gotta pick the item drop right I feel like that's really important yeah alright we're gonna have the exact same build oh we are gonna have the exact same build but those are gimmies but here's the thing though it's that's really that's real that's very useful melee a lot get a zombie hunter level one yeah but that lock on level one what is it what you want aim assist
[115:44.05]Please shoot somebody.
[115:45.09]Please.
[115:46.70]Start shooting people.
[115:47.36]I'm bored.
[115:47.80]We're going to do this.
[115:50.62]We just killed like 500 enemies.
[115:53.32]500 enemies killed.
[115:54.66]Defense.
[115:55.13]I think I'll try the lock.
[115:59.09]It steadies hand when shooting.
[116:00.13]Who cares?
[116:00.57]Alright.
[116:01.83]I'm going for it.
[116:02.79]I'm going to be Mr. Melee.
[116:04.66]Okay.
[116:07.66]I'm going to be crit and... This is locked.
[116:11.22]Because I used... Oh, god damn it.
[116:14.18]Whatever.
[116:14.42]Okay, I'm going to save my points.
[116:19.94]I have enough points.
[116:20.48]Alright, that's fine.
[116:25.35]Okay, let's go.
[116:26.07]Okay.
[116:28.71]I'm going to get item drop.
[116:32.21]Alright, ready?
[116:33.57]I think I'm ready.
[116:34.03]I got item drop, breakout, and lock on.
[116:35.55]I want the melee one, though.
[116:37.44]How do you go to the next screen?
[116:39.00]Do you have to hit escape?
[116:40.08]I think we just have to hit escape.
[116:47.14]Say shpee or something.
[116:49.18]Get out of here.
[116:53.24]Shpeer?
[117:00.06]90% of the population in Tall Oaks has been infected with the virus.
[117:03.68]That rounds out to about 70%.
[117:06.20]We're gonna have to kill 70,000 people.
[117:07.74]What's this phone?
[117:10.58]This is a weird phone.
[117:16.27]That's like what people thought technology was gonna look like in 2012, you know?
[117:22.56]Like we had just invented iPhones like five years prior.
[117:31.59]And then they did Google Glass anyways.
[117:34.17]We all knew it was going to fail, but they did it anyways.
[117:37.38]This is what graphics will be like in 2016.
[117:38.76]You know what the difference in graphics is between this game and a modern game?
[117:52.43]There was no reason to go that fast.
[117:53.83]It's just a person.
[117:54.85]Like, I... Why would you just really wanted to show off that you were gonna ram this guy going like 80?
[118:00.38]You could've just ran him over slowly and killed him.
[118:05.10]There was no point to go that fast.
[118:05.96]You ran over one guy and nearly drove us to our death.
[118:09.99]Yeah.
[118:11.77]There was no reason to do that.
[118:12.89]Alright, I actually need to alt-tab to turn the volume down, so you gotta protect me.
[118:16.97]Okay.
[118:17.33]I'm gonna watch the cutscene first, though.
[118:24.86]Hey, watch this.
[118:27.86]Watch this.
[118:33.58]Um... I don't have any bullets in my gun.
[118:37.15]What?
[118:37.47]How is that guy floating?
[118:42.95]This is making me sick.
[118:46.39]Stop ignoring.
[118:46.81]What?
[118:55.71]Are we dead?
[118:56.09]I think we're okay.
[118:58.53]Good job.
[119:01.21]Oh, here's another guy that said, watch this, before he got behind the wheel.
[119:06.61]Why?
[119:06.83]Why are they doing this?
[119:08.18]Why?
[119:08.80]Hey, check this out.
[119:09.72]See that school bus over there?
[119:11.04]Watch this.
[119:12.10]Oh, is that a hold my beard joke?
[119:15.40]They just all go so fast.
[119:17.06]You don't have to go this fast.
[119:20.80]What if they're all like...
[119:22.97]other players and we're their objective marker so they're just like driving and they think they're going to their objectives but then they're all beelining to ram into us why people saying I'm ignoring everybody what I do what uh who what happened they escaped the infection only to die like this read it's important I'm literally I'm staring at the chat right now I'm reading you have to get to the cathedral how did
[119:52.60]We're the main characters, so that's how we survived and everyone else died.
[119:57.50]Literally every other character is dead at this point, I think.
[120:02.28]Read this, read this.
[120:03.74]Are you going to tell them you can't read?
[120:07.48]Are you still the Among Us guy?
[120:14.53]Not anymore?
[120:16.41]No, not anymore.
[120:16.89]I'm the serial killer guy now.
[120:20.63]Did you see that?
[120:23.66]I see what?
[120:24.24]Were you doing something like serial killer-esque?
[120:26.31]No, um, so on the front page of all Reddit with 50,000 fucking upvotes.
[120:31.29]I'm not even kidding.
[120:33.25]50,000 upvotes.
[120:34.47]Wow.
[120:35.03]They, um... 50,000 upvotes.
[120:37.45]50,000.
[120:37.47]That's like three Reddit golds for the first, like, top comment.
[120:40.86]Yeah, um, actually, you know what?
[120:42.40]I don't even want to, like, breathe life back into this.
[120:44.60]Just know that they put an image of me on the front page of Reddit somehow.
[120:48.22]And it was, like, every serial killer combined into AI.
[120:50.86]And, like, people believed it.
[120:51.86]And it spread everywhere.
[120:53.33]Did you thank the kind strangers?
[120:55.83]No, I actually screamed at them and said, stop fucking ruining my life.
[121:00.51]I'm just going to bury myself.
[121:02.00]Watch out.
[121:02.32]There's a fucking Dark Souls enemy.
[121:05.04]I am in a grave.
[121:08.40]I just drop kicked a zombie in a flooding grave.
[121:12.16]I'm just going to play down here.
[121:16.38]These guys are actually pretty weak.
[121:20.46]Are you stuck or can you get up?
[121:30.22]You actually need help?
[121:31.34]Or is this a routine?
[121:32.18]Don't take care of your business.
[121:38.46]That was for my stream.
[121:39.90]That was for you.
[121:43.10]Oh, that's right.
[121:44.06]You've got to do some comedy routines for your stream.
[121:46.98]It's because if you go down there, you'll see what happens.
[121:51.08]Oh, that is kind of funny.
[121:53.05]It's not funny.
[121:53.71]I just got bit.
[122:02.44]Get me the fuck out of here.
[122:04.40]How do you actually?
[122:05.62]Oh.
[122:05.74]Are you okay?
[122:14.91]Lightning just struck.
[122:15.75]Okay.
[122:16.27]We're fine.
[122:17.19]I sensed a disturbance in the force.
[122:19.81]Oh, dad.
[122:24.93]Because it doesn't do anything crazy when I get hit.
[122:28.38]Only when you do.
[122:31.86]I guess it's supposed to be like a, hey, your partner's in trouble alert.
[122:34.92]Oh, that's probably what it is.
[122:36.38]Did you get the emblem?
[122:36.84]But it takes over the entire screen.
[122:38.16]I can't believe you haven't seen it.
[122:39.36]Did you get the emblem over here?
[122:40.66]Maybe it's because I never get attacked or die.
[122:44.63]Did you get the emblem over here?
[122:45.83]I did, yeah.
[122:46.55]Idiot.
[122:46.91]The giant blue one, I got it, yeah.
[122:50.75]I got it like 10 seconds ago.
[122:55.07]No, no.
[122:56.03]That was it.
[122:57.83]How is that it?
[122:58.67]I think that's just lightning.
[123:01.92]Oh, it's trying to scare us.
[123:02.86]I get it.
[123:03.24]When the lightning strikes, we have new monsters on screen.
[123:08.00]Are the monsters riding the lightning?
[123:10.81]I think they're just here when it's to scare you, I think.
[123:14.03]Is the final boss Zeus?
[123:15.05]I don't know.
[123:18.25]Can we get mythological in Resident Evil?
[123:20.97]I have no idea where this sits in the timeline.
[123:22.78]I have no idea.
[123:30.69]Okay, be more efficient with this.
[123:32.87]Because these guys actually take like three hits from a knife.
[123:37.65]Oh, thank you, Vectro, for the 20 community subs.
[123:40.05]Appreciate it.
[123:40.53]Thank you.
[123:41.17]Thank you.
[123:42.51]Yeah, one, two, three.
[123:48.58]Yeah, it's three hits with a knife.
[123:50.38]I was using shotgun bullets on these idiots.
[123:52.14]I've been watching speedruns.
[123:59.88]I've become... I've become a huge fan of Mario 64 speedrun.
[124:04.30]Hold on.
[124:04.64]Do you need help?
[124:10.23]There you go.
[124:11.29]I literally watched BoxBox get his PB last night.
[124:13.73]It was fucking awesome.
[124:25.52]Did he cut the sandwich into triangles?
[124:27.35]No, I was gonna gift a bunch of subs, but my credit card got declined.
[124:32.35]And he ended the stream right after, so I would look like an idiot.
[124:42.80]I missed every shot, goddammit.
[124:45.56]I don't think you were supposed to kill it anyways.
[124:48.46]Oh.
[124:50.84]Yeah, we were.
[124:52.34]He's got the key in his mouth.
[124:54.70]I've seen this movie.
[124:55.66]He could be chasing us.
[124:57.06]Where's the drunk pirate?
[125:07.37]Where'd you go?
[125:10.11]I'm right here.
[125:12.37]Are you doing like a year invisible joke?
[125:14.27]No, no, no.
[125:15.24]I saw the indicator.
[125:16.30]I didn't know if you were down here.
[125:20.86]Sprinting is like 5% faster than just moving.
[125:29.21]Don't even attack.
[125:30.28]What's the point?
[125:31.40]We gotta get the dog.
[125:34.26]What?
[125:34.44]Alright, but that's like actual zombie.
[125:37.40]Okay.
[125:37.96]Zombie apocalypse day 14.
[125:41.86]You just go outside your house.
[125:43.22]You see a bunch of zombies in the street.
[125:44.80]What's the point?
[125:46.72]There's 2 million more.
[125:47.86]What's the point?
[125:48.44]Alright, there he is.
[125:49.96]There he is.
[125:50.22]He's probably gonna run.
[125:57.36]Alright, get that key.
[126:00.67]Key?
[126:03.47]Hello?
[126:03.79]What are you looking at?
[126:04.91]Get out of here.
[126:05.47]Me?
[126:06.01]No, this guy was just looking off my shoulder.
[126:12.79]Is Etalyx a friend or a foe?
[126:13.98]A foe, absolutely.
[126:15.64]100%.
[126:16.28]What?
[126:16.62]Which one?
[126:17.32]Oh, 100%.
[126:19.50]Fro?
[126:21.16]Oh, 100%.
[126:22.46]This is the reason why.
[126:23.08]I don't have to explain anymore.
[126:31.49]If I was a foe, would I do this?
[126:35.77]Yeah, I think so.
[126:44.18]I said we run.
[126:46.36]You got it.
[126:46.84]I'm running.
[126:52.04]What happened?
[126:54.26]I'm just doing some overkill.
[126:56.39]You okay?
[126:57.21]Yeah, I'm coming.
[127:00.33]I'm running all the way back up the winding path.
[127:03.45]That guy was so weird.
[127:04.46]Alright, we're at the door of the cemetery.
[127:09.74]Is this the haunted house portion of the game?
[127:11.18]Okay, we're in.
[127:11.58]Probably.
[127:16.23]I'm pressing V, nothing's happening.
[127:17.65]V!
[127:17.71]Did you see?
[127:21.05]Press V!
[127:28.55]What?
[127:29.03]Okay.
[127:30.39]Bye.
[127:31.55]God damn it.
[127:34.72]No one can revive you down there.
[127:36.56]And the stu- What the f- I- You can't attack anybody until they have their spawn protection is removed.
[127:43.17]I- What- What is this?
[127:51.65]We're both running from the same thing?
[127:54.01]No, I'm in the mausoleum thing.
[127:56.71]What do you call it when there's a big stone?
[128:02.62]What?
[128:02.90]I can't go that way.
[128:06.08]It's a maze.
[128:11.08]There's at least two blue carnivals over here.
[128:16.12]I think he just got in my head.
[128:18.71]There's two collectibles?
[128:22.33]What are you doing to me?
[128:23.23]What the hell dude?
[128:26.13]Is that?
[128:26.61]Are you doing that?
[128:27.62]Why are you taking like a disposable flash in my face?
[128:32.88]Is he coming back?
[128:35.12]Alright, I think I'm about to save you.
[128:39.68]No you're not.
[128:40.44]I'm at the thing.
[128:42.56]I got it.
[128:44.76]Oh, I need you.
[128:46.40]Wait.
[128:49.32]Okay, maybe I'm in trouble now.
[128:52.38]Over here.
[128:54.04]Why do I have your image?
[128:58.20]That's strange.
[128:59.30]Why am I seeing this?
[129:00.82]Over here.
[129:02.36]Helena.
[129:05.13]Oh my god.
[129:06.81]You're just like voice calming.
[129:08.73]I got two screamers.
[129:15.03]Over here.
[129:15.51]I'm working on it.
[129:16.77]I can watch your perspective if you hold V. Oh Shit alright.
[129:26.76]Oh Come on don't even You hold the V you're in Okay, oh I might be dead I can help you.
[129:42.60]I'm here.
[129:42.82]Oh
[129:46.83]I can literally throw a grenade over there.
[129:51.25]I'm just running by.
[129:52.15]How do you see me?
[129:53.53]You're on the map.
[129:56.25]But I can hold V when I'm in the middle of the waiting for you.
[130:00.91]They are.
[130:01.17]This game is scary.
[130:03.80]Literally.
[130:22.04]Checkpoint.
[130:23.02]You could have come back there and helped me at any time.
[130:25.50]I was in my own problem.
[130:26.50]I was stuck over there on the other side.
[130:27.92]Yeah, you were stuck on the gate holding V and telling me about spectator mode.
[130:31.98]That's before that I beat you in the race to get to that point because I just made my way through.
[130:36.23]I was in a problem area as well as you were.
[130:39.89]I was hanging back so I could get more kills.
[130:41.65]At the end of the mission, I have more kills than you.
[130:43.69]I mean, what if it helps you fucking sleep at night, bro?
[130:49.96]That sounds like I just swallowed like a fucking bug Okay, there's a lot I think we just have to kill This really is the closest game to House of the Dead
[131:22.29]Yeah.
[131:24.01]Yeah.
[131:24.99]They do the throw thing, too.
[131:27.69]I gotta collect items, man.
[131:28.85]I'm just being... I'm just... I gotta... Get ready.
[131:33.24]Here comes company.
[131:35.54]Ready.
[131:37.46]What's that from?
[131:41.74]And I'll give you fucking $100.
[131:42.36]I swear to God.
[131:43.06]That was a good Animal Crossing voice.
[131:45.51]Nope.
[131:45.63]Wrong.
[131:45.89]Wrong.
[131:51.89]I mean, you were doing Mortal Kombat at first.
[131:53.87]That was Saber Wolf stuck in an ultra combo in Killer Instinct.
[132:00.10]You don't get $100.
[132:00.52]I only played Killer Instinct on Game Boy.
[132:08.68]How did that kill me?
[132:12.98]You're a furry.
[132:17.30]Jesus!
[132:20.66]Would you call me?
[132:26.36]Get him away!
[132:29.16]What?
[132:30.08]What?
[132:30.54]Oh, you're super dead.
[132:33.90]What is that even?
[132:34.70]How?
[132:40.75]I see it!
[132:41.35]Hurry!
[132:42.57]You know, this game really is... It's just making us do waves of enemies.
[132:47.51]This is not even Resident Evil.
[132:48.53]This is just a wave shooter.
[132:51.57]This is the extra game mode to a Resident Evil game that's out.
[132:58.35]They did do that, like in Resident Evil 5.
[133:00.30]That was the multiplayer, like... What do they call it?
[133:04.46]This is just the regular campaign.
[133:06.22]Yeah, this is the regular campaign.
[133:09.00]Okay, well... Let's go for it again.
[133:16.17]The special multiplayer mode where you do this.
[133:19.93]Alright, I'm going for headshots here.
[133:28.59]Were you not before?
[133:30.95]Sometimes.
[133:33.34]The people that are running, make sure they go down first.
[133:40.32]Like that guy.
[133:40.84]Alright, I got an idea.
[133:43.74]You take those guys out.
[133:47.05]I'm going to set up some bombs.
[133:48.41]I'm going to set up a bomb there.
[133:53.25]You can only do one bomb at a time.
[133:54.31]Never mind.
[133:57.40]I think we're alright.
[133:58.68]There's not that many.
[134:00.68]Don't get overwhelmed.
[134:08.42]Okay, back it up.
[134:10.00]Actually, this is probably a good place to plant a bomb.
[134:17.24]I did not want to do that.
[134:18.82]I... This is... I can't press any buttons.
[134:20.86]Alright, you watch that way.
[134:21.54]I'll watch this way.
[134:22.38]I want to get up, but I can't left click.
[134:24.48]I just left click up, but you're okay.
[134:26.07]I hope you're okay.
[134:28.13]Oh, what the fuck?
[134:29.97]That dude just fell off.
[134:31.07]Did you shoot him?
[134:37.55]Are we just... Seriously, for this one person?
[134:39.79]The scream guys are coming in.
[134:41.79]Alright, I'm about to... I'm gonna... I got a bomb over there on the left side.
[134:46.45]I can take him out in... I'm going for it.
[134:49.13]I'm gonna blow him up right now.
[134:52.95]He's on the ground.
[134:54.32]Nice job.
[134:55.54]We did it.
[134:56.24]Dude, you fell off.
[134:57.80]Ratio.
[134:58.58]Whatever.
[134:59.84]L. L. Oh, L. Okay.
[135:07.98]We good?
[135:08.28]Hey, he's gonna scream.
[135:11.87]Are you okay?
[135:12.97]I want.
[135:14.33]Why are the red ones drunk?
[135:16.61]I know they shimmy around.
[135:18.33]Can we go inside?
[135:25.61]They won't let us in until it's safe.
[135:30.15]I got bit three times.
[135:34.92]Reloading.
[135:37.08]Okay, I just opened the inventory.
[135:39.26]Am I dead?
[135:41.60]What happened?
[135:42.52]I'm on the ground.
[135:43.32]What?
[135:43.66]Oh, I... Tell them to wait!
[135:46.56]Tell them to wait!
[135:47.50]Run!
[135:47.84]We have to run.
[135:48.64]There's too many.
[135:52.46]Oh, no.
[135:53.98]Are you actually dead dead?
[135:54.74]I did run, though.
[135:55.58]I did run.
[135:58.44]I didn't have any tic-tacs.
[136:02.58]Don't worry.
[136:02.86]We got a checkpoint.
[136:04.44]Did we actually?
[136:05.02]I don't think we did.
[136:06.36]Just kidding.
[136:07.06]Got him.
[136:08.62]L plus ratio.
[136:09.84]Hold on.
[136:10.24]I...
[136:12.61]We have to have a better strategy here because this is just, this is not gonna work.
[136:15.97]This scene's too long.
[136:16.89]We have to wait till every single enemy's dead.
[136:29.02]Yeah, to have that... Let me get... This is not, this is not, there's no jokes in this scene.
[136:33.62]We just have to win.
[136:35.24]I hate that F is to do that.
[136:36.82]Alright, um... It's okay.
[136:38.86]No more messing around.
[136:40.14]No more messing around.
[136:41.04]This is freaking stupid.
[136:47.61]Okay, let's go.
[136:48.33]What?
[136:48.45]No, stop.
[136:48.93]What are you doing?
[136:50.43]No.
[136:50.57]What are you doing to my Wellington?
[136:52.68]No.
[136:52.82]Stop it.
[136:53.40]No.
[136:53.54]Gross.
[136:53.72]What are you doing?
[136:54.34]What are you doing to my Wellington?
[137:07.56]You don't know what that is, and everybody in my chat... I do know what that is, because I know who Gordon Ramsay is.
[137:12.53]No, but you don't know what that is, though.
[137:14.33]Yes, I know.
[137:14.85]It's his YouTube videos.
[137:16.61]No, no, no.
[137:17.45]It's his TikTok.
[137:18.97]Okay, but he posts them to YouTube.
[137:20.85]Oh, does he?
[137:21.80]yeah he posts them to youtube and he does a review people send him oh you do know what it is you do yeah I do know I mean that's what he does because I watch him yeah he goes stop what are you doing everyone the last two I watched though they did it like really good and he was impressed was he actually impressed I never seen him impressed he's like okay alright good looks looks very moist yeah but then they put the m m's in it and he goes no oh stop it what are you doing
[137:52.26]Tell me when you're gonna blow that up.
[137:54.23]Is it just me or is Gordon Ramsay, like, as he gets older, starting to look like Daniel Craig?
[137:58.67]I think Gordon Ramsay's, like, one of the... Probably one of the coolest people on television.
[138:02.92]Yeah.
[138:04.08]I missed every shot.
[138:06.32]I love the way Gordon Ramsay, like, talks with his body.
[138:08.16]Have you noticed that?
[138:13.44]When he says words, you'll notice it.
[138:15.71]He kind of bounces, and his arms come up, his arms come down, and he goes on his tippy toes down.
[138:19.85]He raises his shoulders while his facial expression changes.
[138:22.61]I love it.
[138:23.49]To disdain.
[138:27.78]I love his cadences.
[138:28.66]They're so cool.
[138:31.14]I'm not kidding around either.
[138:32.16]I think he's exactly cool.
[138:33.86]Alright, be careful.
[138:34.54]There's someone in there with a little backbone.
[138:43.37]Scream guy coming?
[138:44.85]Yep.
[138:45.83]Two?
[138:46.33]Maybe?
[138:46.69]One?
[138:47.77]Alright.
[138:48.11]Guy with the bullfrog.
[138:48.95]Alright.
[138:51.57]You have the bomb there.
[138:52.39]Let me know if you're going to blow it up.
[138:54.50]Oh, shit.
[138:54.98]You can knock the guys off the edges.
[138:56.18]That's actually perfect.
[139:00.76]Oh, you can just shoot them back on the other side.
[139:02.20]You can shoot them down.
[139:03.18]Yeah.
[139:06.66]Are they on?
[139:06.96]They're on fire.
[139:08.80]That's good.
[139:11.60]Like, they drop their torch, I mean, and it starts a fire.
[139:14.11]Can I climb over there?
[139:20.19]Alright, let him actually get over so we can get the items.
[139:28.33]Because we want to make sure we get the items.
[139:31.75]Alright, now... Wait.
[139:32.65]You're still shooting, though.
[139:33.61]Okay.
[139:34.35]I'm ready.
[139:34.65]Hold on.
[139:34.81]I got a bomb right here.
[139:35.61]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[139:41.65]I would like to get more than one guy, but I'll take... Not that... Just do it.
[139:48.62]Do it!
[139:52.08]Jesus.
[139:56.81]Fuck!
[139:57.41]Alright, let us in.
[139:59.67]He said, alright, alright.
[140:02.69]In, in, in, in, in, in, in, in.
[140:06.91]What?
[140:08.23]Oh.
[140:09.67]What happened?
[140:10.15]I can't see anything.
[140:11.35]I can't see anything.
[140:12.95]He screamed.
[140:14.97]Are you alright?
[140:18.06]I'm going to pass out.
[140:22.98]I'm going to pass out.
[140:23.68]I think I actually might pass out.
[140:25.62]I might actually pass out.
[140:26.68]I'm not kidding.
[140:27.22]Come to the door.
[140:28.24]Come to the door.
[140:29.06]Come to the door.
[140:29.91]Come to the door.
[140:30.55]I'm going to pass out.
[140:33.46]No, you're gonna live, right?
[140:39.71]Oh, no, man.
[140:48.89]Oh, no.
[140:51.95]Oh, no.
[140:54.35]Okay, so once you get raised off the ground, you can't sprint.
[140:58.27]I don't know.
[140:59.33]So I have to jog.
[141:01.45]This is the whole game, by the way.
[141:02.61]This is the final level.
[141:03.55]I did not ditch him.
[141:05.41]I heard the call for help.
[141:07.23]I saw that he was surrounded by people.
[141:09.93]I got over there.
[141:10.79]I grenaded.
[141:11.55]And I almost passed out.
[141:14.16]But I'm okay.
[141:17.24]Yeah, that was the last thing I heard.
[141:18.76]I'm gonna pass out.
[141:19.60]It sounded like... It sounded like you tried to make your trauma more than my almost dying trauma.
[141:27.51]Okay, buddy.
[141:28.17]Why did you almost pass out?
[141:30.17]Because I thought it was funny and I didn't breathe.
[141:33.39]I got really tense and then laughed and then my brain was like, it's time for you to shut off.
[141:43.88]We're just trying to get more gameplay out of this.
[141:46.06]This is like 100% run today, by the way.
[141:48.72]We just have to stay back and just shoot from afar.
[141:51.44]There's no reason to even go forward.
[141:53.54]Just forget about the loot.
[141:54.46]Just shoot them and let them die.
[141:55.66]Yes, just shoot them and let them die.
[142:00.98]They're walking in circles.
[142:08.36]Watch out behind you!
[142:12.22]Okay, here's the thing.
[142:13.92]Do I have any herbs?
[142:16.70]I do.
[142:16.96]I can combine.
[142:19.91]This is game-changer.
[142:22.19]Okay.
[142:23.47]Now, we actually... Who gives a shit?
[142:25.21]Just kill them on the other side.
[142:29.30]I didn't have any tic-tacs before.
[142:30.74]He better not.
[142:32.16]Okay.
[142:33.82]You know.
[142:34.02]No, no, no.
[142:34.54]Fuck it.
[142:35.06]Fuck this.
[142:39.52]Where did that even go?
[142:40.72]What?
[142:41.92]Where did that go?
[142:43.06]You just shot me in the head.
[142:44.16]I did?
[142:46.68]I was saving you from this guy.
[142:50.70]Watch out.
[142:51.05]Watch out.
[142:51.35]Watch out.
[142:51.61]Watch out.
[142:51.85]I'm throwing a bomb.
[142:54.51]That was a good bomb.
[142:57.11]Two bombs?
[142:57.89]Yes.
[142:58.35]I had to do it.
[143:01.78]Alright, now it's almost ready.
[143:03.14]Teamwork.
[143:11.86]Make sure you collect all the items.
[143:19.61]Goodness, head's gone.
[143:20.25]Alright, this is where we get just absolutely messed up.
[143:23.55]Hold on.
[143:28.53]Alright, just go and press B.
[143:37.27]Thank goodness.
[143:38.37]That was so bad.
[143:42.89]To be fair, the level we were just on is representative of the entire game.
[143:47.89]So, I mean, we could just pretend like those were different levels.
[143:50.91]We could.
[143:51.17]This game gets dramatically easier if you're bad.
[143:58.29]What?
[143:59.87]Are you?
[144:01.55]Sorry, guys.
[144:03.75]We're not rescue workers.
[144:07.16]So which one of these guys is going to say, watch this and drive the school bus with all of us in it and kill everybody here?
[144:13.96]Wait, I think if you die, they reduce enemies on the next life?
[144:18.31]Or is that like, just a meme?
[144:21.47]That sounds like a meme to me.
[144:25.67]There were definitely no scream guys.
[144:29.73]That time.
[144:31.77]Alright, search the cathedral.
[144:33.39]Okay, question.
[144:33.97]If you were in a zombie apocalypse and you were in this cathedral and there were two people outside begging for help, do you open the door?
[144:39.90]Uh, well, that's very, very much very contextual based because it does this fake scenario.
[144:48.46]If you're bit, do you get infected?
[144:52.16]I was open the last time I was here.
[144:53.80]I don't know, because the heroes get bit all the time in this, but when people get bit, they turn, right?
[144:58.41]Like, if you're not a main character.
[145:00.37]I mean, it's tricky.
[145:01.55]I would say that you'd probably bring them in, and we'd make a place, like, maybe pile up a bunch of these church benches, and, like, make, like, a cube that we put that person in, and they stay in there for, like, a week.
[145:13.50]Okay, so we, like, quarantine people.
[145:14.78]Yes.
[145:15.22]Like, even if, at least, like, a day or two.
[145:16.64]And look, it's not like we're gonna, we'll feed you, we'll make sure you're okay.
[145:19.96]But, like, just to make sure you don't turn in 24 hours.
[145:22.06]Alright, uh, zombie ethics question.
[145:25.92]Do you wait until somebody, like, turns into a zombie to shoot them if they're guaranteed, like, infected and gonna turn?
[145:31.64]No.
[145:31.90]Absolutely not.
[145:32.80]Absolutely not.
[145:33.34]This isn't just part of the decor.
[145:35.48]Because that, that person can be useful until they turn.
[145:39.08]Okay, but do you tell them that you're going to do it before you do it, or you, like, rip the band-aid off?
[145:42.76]It depends on how their immunity is, like, right?
[145:44.34]Some people might get bit and they're infected.
[145:45.54]I think it depends on their attitude.
[145:46.48]Like, if they suck, I'm just going to do it right now.
[145:48.56]If they're, like, nice, I'll give them a little time.
[145:51.02]There's a lot going on there, I think.
[145:56.03]But, yes, if somebody is new, they go into the cube.
[146:00.33]We'll make, like, a little cube so, like, if they turn into a zombie, they can't do anything.
[146:02.93]Okay.
[146:04.85]And then after that, and if it's like, okay, I haven't been bit or anything, I'm fine.
[146:10.84]And we go, alright, soldier.
[146:13.56]We like throw like a big gun and they catch it.
[146:15.42]And it's like, okay, geez.
[146:17.71]Where are you?
[146:19.65]I'm at the co-op moment.
[146:22.85]We're both at a different co-op moment, by the way.
[146:25.85]Oh, are we?
[146:27.79]Oh, I'll come over there.
[146:37.15]literally the other side of the exact same ladder well now what do you have to do I have the key item so I put the key item there there is a uh over in like the weird um clock holes thing over on the top kind of right side there's one of those we have to have two orange slices some no two grapefruits
[146:57.63]And if we put both the grapefruits, the motherly smile will shine upon us, and the path will be revealed.
[147:04.13]Really important, in the old telephone, like the old 1920s telephone up in the top, with the glasses, there's one of those blue things to shoot.
[147:12.08]Shoot it.
[147:13.32]Okay.
[147:13.98]Up at the top.
[147:14.94]Up at the top.
[147:15.38]Which side?
[147:17.22]Where I'm facing.
[147:18.26]It's on your side.
[147:18.88]It's above you.
[147:19.48]It's on the balcony.
[147:20.44]It looks like an old telephone.
[147:22.36]It's a big window with big telephone holes.
[147:26.05]And there's a blue thing to shoot.
[147:27.01]Oh, I see it.
[147:31.74]Thank you.
[147:32.74]Now my achievements can be complete.
[147:35.50]I have one bullet.
[147:37.12]It's not good.
[147:42.46]Alright, so then you have to do the puzzle?
[147:43.61]Oh, you have to knock that down.
[147:51.43]So am I not supposed to be exploring these rooms?
[147:55.59]I think you're supposed to knock down the candy cane ladder, I think.
[147:58.63]Okay, well I'm going to take all the loot first.
[148:01.25]Actually, I might be able to solve the puzzle.
[148:04.29]Actually, no, you have to pick this one up.
[148:05.83]No, I can do everything.
[148:07.37]It says that you have two.
[148:09.19]I did kick down one.
[148:17.58]Okay, you got it.
[148:18.80]Yep.
[148:19.12]You said there's stuff up here, so I want to get it.
[148:25.19]I think we both have to put a statue on at the same time, but on opposite sides.
[148:30.51]Okay.
[148:35.17]Okay, I'm going to go to this one.
[148:39.73]So, I am putting one here.
[148:41.65]That was huge.
[148:50.58]We probably shouldn't have opened this.
[148:51.90]Isn't this supposed to be a safe place?
[148:54.22]This is the equipment.
[148:55.19]I'm not going to... No, I'm not going to do it.
[148:59.15]I refuse to... I'm not going to do it.
[149:03.49]There's a scene in pop culture media from the not-too-distant past that this reminds me of.
[149:08.11]Well, don't ruin the... Don't spoil anything.
[149:13.81]Alright, just checking to see if we got everything.
[149:15.23]We can go.
[149:17.49]A media property with undead where the heroes go into the belly of the crypt in order to get away from the... It's not referencing anything.
[149:24.32]How do you... How do you dive... Oh, right.
[149:26.30]It's like space.
[149:26.88]We have to be aimed at.
[149:33.03]reset I'm sick of you um uh there that why is it I thought that was you that did it I can't I can't shoot this no this is you do I what am I supposed to do just dive what am I how what do I do about this can you help what do you do I I'm stuck on the other side is there something you can shoot oh I think I can just
[149:59.82]I like how your first order of business was to immediately blame me.
[150:03.28]Well, I don't know.
[150:05.38]Now it's your turn.
[150:08.64]You just saw me do it.
[150:09.62]Now you know what to do.
[150:10.86]Didn't even get hit once.
[150:14.17]Why did they both come out at the same time?
[150:17.59]Wouldn't that have caused some chaos in the comms?
[150:19.63]Like, oh my god, what's this?
[150:20.85]Oh, you got it too?
[150:21.67]Oh, this is shooting both of us.
[150:22.69]Like, we could have had a little panic bomb.
[150:24.85]Yeah.
[150:25.31]Yeah, this game's... Alright, it's me versus you.
[150:28.81]We're going to see point scores, I guess.
[150:32.58]You can't decide that in the middle of the... Oh, yeah?
[150:38.00]Oh, somebody got hit.
[150:39.66]I see somebody got hit.
[150:43.00]Oh, it looks like somebody's going to get hit twice.
[150:45.88]Let's get a fucking close up.
[150:49.52]Why is the activation button suddenly space when before it was always V for the entire rest of the game?
[150:55.74]It's fair.
[151:05.33]Are they even happening on your side or am I the only one doing this?
[151:08.53]Oh, they're happening.
[151:09.15]Are you just watching me?
[151:12.44]It's probably going to be three now.
[151:13.74]Okay, now it's your turn.
[151:17.24]Okay, that one wasn't fair.
[151:23.49]Oh, shit.
[151:24.21]Alright, this one's kind of unfair.
[151:28.69]Fucking move, what are you, stupid?
[151:29.94]They shoot you after... Yeah, exactly.
[151:33.86]Why can't I hit this one?
[151:43.20]Got him.
[151:44.68]Get up!
[151:45.92]Uh-oh.
[151:46.48]Uh-oh.
[151:49.16]Having a little trouble over here on this side, looks like.
[151:51.36]I was fine until you came over here.
[152:00.02]Oh, my God, dude.
[152:06.30]Oh, the rule of threes.
[152:09.02]You gotta have three separate sessions of the same event.
[152:17.22]The developers of this game played too much Mario.
[152:24.07]Okay, we're good.
[152:26.85]Who is he talking to?
[152:27.63]I have no idea.
[152:31.17]Do you have to aim at this?
[152:31.99]Watch out!
[152:40.63]Watch out for what?
[152:41.55]I think you have to aim this or do I have to aim this?
[152:49.09]Why is it heating up?
[152:50.75]I don't know.
[152:51.01]I think you have to aim it.
[152:51.71]There's no way for me to move it.
[152:58.30]Oh, hey, dude.
[152:59.34]Aim your gun at mine.
[153:03.04]Aim your gun at mine?
[153:03.76]Aim your laser at mine.
[153:04.64]Okay.
[153:06.28]Okay.
[153:07.52]Why is it not working?
[153:09.08]Oh, you meant like at the thing behind you.
[153:10.40]Yeah, yeah.
[153:12.12]Listen, grammatically speaking, the nearest antecedent, you said aim your laser at mine.
[153:16.44]So I was aiming my laser at your laser.
[153:20.89]And then our lasers touch.
[153:22.87]The words you're using are too big.
[153:24.19]Dumb it down.
[153:34.89]Where are you?
[153:35.91]I'm coming up.
[153:36.41]There's a guy on my side.
[153:37.65]I think I have to wait for you.
[153:42.16]Why is it here?
[153:43.40]Can we not open this?
[153:44.40]There's a door?
[153:45.84]There's a door, but it doesn't... It doesn't have a prompt?
[153:50.84]Is there a laser?
[153:53.70]Oh, yeah, there is.
[153:54.36]You're going to have a laser on your side.
[153:57.25]Kind of overlooking the... Did you throw a grenade at me?
[154:02.33]Did you throw a grenade at me?
[154:03.89]Yes or no?
[154:04.29]It's a very simple question.
[154:06.33]Yes, Your Honor.
[154:08.41]Aim your laser at the thing back there.
[154:11.43]What?
[154:13.30]Over the- look, that way.
[154:14.53]Oh, over here.
[154:15.71]No, yeah, it's not throw grenade at friend and kill friend.
[154:21.07]I'm just trying to increase my chances for the scorecard at the end.
[154:24.61]I had like full health too, what the fuck.
[154:26.45]Uh, yeah, there's a dude again.
[154:35.28]Oh, this one's a mirror.
[154:39.86]Oh my goodness, please just die, dude.
[154:44.94]Alright, so this one's a mirror, yeah, okay, looks, yeah, so... I'm aiming at one, oh.
[154:50.79]Mm, yep.
[154:52.11]Doing it right, and we're free.
[154:54.23]Very good.
[154:56.09]The Madonna of Sorrow.
[154:57.25]This is... There's no puzzles in this game.
[155:05.34]...thrilling, somebody said.
[155:08.36]This is thrilling.
[155:09.16]Ooh, yup.
[155:10.48]We going in shit-talking this stream?
[155:11.94]Is that what's happening?
[155:12.52]Yeah, that's a sniper rifle.
[155:15.32]Come get the sniper if you didn't.
[155:17.98]Oh, yep.
[155:19.16]Yep.
[155:22.32]Do you shoot this key?
[155:24.07]Oh, you have to shoot something to open the gate for the key item.
[155:27.11]Oh, the bells?
[155:27.57]Alright, so you look like you got this down.
[155:35.23]We have to do them like all of this three.
[155:41.92]Is there a fourth?
[155:43.96]Oh, there might be a fourth.
[155:48.36]All the way at the end?
[155:48.98]Yeah, there's one more down there.
[155:49.98]Is there even a bell?
[155:55.48]I don't... Yeah, I don't see anything over there.
[156:07.51]Uh... There's definitely nowhere to go over here.
[156:16.27]It's a secret hidden bell.
[156:18.01]Can we go up?
[156:18.51]Uh-oh.
[156:23.93]It's definitely there.
[156:27.85]Toll the five bells loud and clear, and thus the true... Oh, I see it.
[156:32.40]Cheeky.
[156:33.02]It's on the... Oops.
[156:36.18]Did that work?
[156:37.66]Where is it?
[156:38.65]Spin.
[156:39.95]I don't know if I just made this way harder to do.
[156:44.07]Oh, wait.
[156:45.25]Do you see it?
[156:46.11]It is spinning.
[156:46.65]Is that five?
[156:49.87]Not quite.
[156:50.37]I think I shot the actual weather vane instead of the bell and made it spin faster.
[156:55.77]I think that's ringing.
[156:57.97]Is there a fifth bell?
[156:58.99]One, two, three, four.
[157:00.43]Oh, yeah.
[157:00.92]There's one back there.
[157:02.34]Yep.
[157:02.62]I know where it is.
[157:03.04]I get it.
[157:04.88]Teamwork.
[157:13.11]It was another rooster.
[157:14.15]Very nice.
[157:25.92]Somebody said, God, this game sucks.
[157:29.14]You don't like two straight hours of non-stop action followed by two straight hours of puzzles?
[157:37.23]No.
[157:38.37]It's perfectly balanced.
[157:41.68]I think I want to be the sniper of the group.
[157:44.30]You can't.
[157:44.74]You picked melee.
[157:46.02]I got crit.
[157:47.56]Yeah, I didn't unlock melee.
[157:51.28]I said I was thinking about doing melee, but I could be sniper.
[157:53.44]Actually, that's probably a bad idea.
[157:54.30]I don't think you said thinking.
[157:55.10]I think you said I'm going to be the melee guy.
[157:57.52]It's very definitive.
[157:58.46]Get the fuck over there and do what you're supposed to do.
[158:01.45]This is what you're supposed to do.
[158:03.19]You can't shoot the chandelier down.
[158:09.33]Why not?
[158:11.40]Alright, you can be the sniper.
[158:12.24]Sniper sucks.
[158:13.04]And, uh, also... Everyone's just gonna make fun, you know, if you miss because the shaky cam is so extreme while zooming in.
[158:22.88]It's actually not bad.
[158:24.35]Turn your, um... Turn your aiming down.
[158:31.11]I should stop drinking so much.
[158:32.27]Uh-oh.
[158:37.89]Boss?
[158:38.17]Boss?
[158:45.81]Okay, so when they... Listen, I understand Umbrella... Umbrella's everywhere.
[158:52.04]But how do people trapped in ancient crypt chambers get infected like this?
[158:58.12]Like that.
[158:59.84]Yeah, but nobody had opened that potentially for centuries, you know what I'm saying?
[159:03.72]Yeah.
[159:04.10]We just did it.
[159:07.30]So who put the zombie there and then resealed it?
[159:12.59]No, no, you're not doing protocol.
[159:14.55]Put him over in the cube first.
[159:16.17]Put him in the cube.
[159:18.07]Put him in the cube first.
[159:19.19]That's protocol.
[159:20.67]No, put... What the fuck?
[159:29.86]Somebody just attacked me.
[159:31.70]Oh, look out for the... I'm actually on the ground.
[159:36.57]Oh, God.
[159:36.71]I'm still alright.
[159:37.15]I think... I'm... Yeah, I can't get up.
[159:38.97]I couldn't move.
[159:39.39]Oh, man.
[159:39.59]Oh, at least we'll have full health.
[159:40.83]Remember when you threw the fucking incendiary grenade at me as a joke and took off six cubes of health?
[160:07.30]Maybe you should have gotten the inventory and practiced some rules.
[160:12.43]Alright, if you have trypophobia, you should probably look away from this game.
[160:17.11]Alright, probably time to get some distance.
[160:26.29]I'm gonna put a bomb down here, be careful.
[160:27.61]I'm gonna try to get aggro.
[160:30.87]Hey, look over here, you big stupid alien!
[160:32.49]Hey, clear comms, clear comms.
[160:38.95]Get over here.
[160:46.11]Where is it going?
[160:49.08]Why is it running away from us?
[160:51.70]It's climbing.
[160:52.76]It's climbing the stairs?
[160:55.20]Wait, why is it up there?
[160:56.62]I put a bomb.
[160:57.94]There's someone else.
[160:58.78]Oh, the other survivors are up there.
[161:03.44]Oh shit, this guy up here.
[161:05.14]This guy's fucked.
[161:13.73]I don't... Okay.
[161:15.55]Careful that... Right now, we're just like, we're playing a MOBA and getting pissed at the other players on the team for like, not doing their job.
[161:27.12]I've got bombs set up in the middle of the church.
[161:29.96]Oh my god, leave me alone.
[161:38.04]It's still up there.
[161:41.40]What did I just do?
[161:42.08]I have no idea what just happened.
[161:44.64]I think I combined something accidentally.
[161:50.00]Alright.
[161:50.56]There it is.
[161:54.14]My bomb's right here.
[161:54.99]Alright.
[161:56.81]Blow it up.
[161:58.59]He didn't go this way.
[162:00.79]You got aggro.
[162:01.61]I got a bomb.
[162:02.19]I got a bomb over here.
[162:03.57]Run towards me.
[162:04.91]I got one right here.
[162:08.18]They're, like, climbing the stairs very slowly.
[162:12.34]Alright, come this way.
[162:15.57]Detonate the bomb?
[162:16.75]Excuse me?
[162:18.03]What?
[162:19.75]It won't press.
[162:20.97]It won't press.
[162:21.69]Oh, my.
[162:26.39]Alright.
[162:28.25]Just move away.
[162:29.37]That was such a weird scream.
[162:31.17]It won't press.
[162:31.65]It won't press.
[162:32.47]I got it.
[162:32.69]I got it.
[162:37.47]It's just like poppin' bubble wrap boss.
[162:43.04]Right in the stomach.
[162:44.38]It's gonna scream, run.
[162:47.04]No!
[162:49.34]Help me.
[162:51.22]I'm on the ground.
[162:52.20]Okay, I'm coming.
[162:53.68]This is gonna... Thanks.
[163:01.37]Why is it making baby noises?
[163:06.93]Why is he climbing again?
[163:08.79]Get down!
[163:09.53]Where are you going, dude?
[163:12.03]Okay, we got it.
[163:13.21]I hope one person survived.
[163:34.36]Okay, I honestly thought an NPC came up and looted the key item.
[163:41.76]That'd be so funny.
[163:46.08]It just runs away.
[163:47.86]Make sure we don't miss anything.
[163:48.76]This is important.
[163:49.52]Their blood is on your hands.
[163:56.20]No, their blood is on this thing's hands.
[163:59.80]This thing came in.
[164:01.12]Think about how many more people would have died if we weren't here.
[164:03.94]I just tried to do it, alright?
[164:05.08]It doesn't work.
[164:07.26]Do it.
[164:08.04]I just, I tried.
[164:08.86]It doesn't work.
[164:09.96]Do it.
[164:10.22]Okay, how about, um, is there any sniper ammo anywhere?
[164:14.97]Yeah, I just picked it up.
[164:19.75]Okay, uh, we need to just leave.
[164:22.01]Pretty cool.
[164:28.86]What about up top?
[164:30.06]I'm checking up top, too.
[164:30.80]I don't want to miss anything.
[164:32.36]Okay, alright.
[164:34.80]Stuff died up here, right?
[164:38.24]Technically, it's probably civilians that died.
[164:40.74]I don't know if they drop anything.
[164:44.58]By the way, have you noticed any significant increase in stuff that's dropped on the ground?
[164:47.64]Because I have not.
[164:49.61]And we both have that perk.
[164:51.35]I feel like it's not doing anything.
[164:55.13]It's kind of hard to say.
[164:55.97]It felt like there was a bunch of stuff, but that was also a boss fight.
[164:58.33]So they kind of have to litter the floor with things to not soft block you.
[165:03.13]Alright.
[165:04.94]We're, uh... Ready to move.
[165:11.51]Perk does so little.
[165:12.61]Hey, come on.
[165:13.33]Don't miss this stuff.
[165:14.51]Ooh, 4,000.
[165:14.81]Nice.
[165:17.59]Alright.
[165:18.85]Very nice.
[165:19.29]You're just gonna leave that person?
[165:20.67]Yes.
[165:20.75]Yes.
[165:35.47]They're safer here than wherever we're going.
[165:37.37]As the main characters, we have a magnet-like attraction to progressively more difficult enemies.
[165:42.01]They're literally safer the further they are away from us.
[165:44.33]Have you seen all the vehicular explosions?
[165:46.54]You need to pee.
[165:47.42]I need to blow my nose.
[165:50.18]That's like peeing through your nose.
[165:52.04]Alright, while I pee, do you want to blow your nose?
[165:54.04]We'll take a two-minute break.
[165:55.56]Yeah, we can take a pee break.
[165:57.16]Okay.
[165:57.89]Alright.
[165:58.11]But if we're taking a break, then I got to take the dog out.
[166:01.13]Okay.
[166:02.25]Five minutes?
[166:02.59]Ten minutes?
[166:03.17]You're going to resident sleep with me.
[166:04.63]Okay.
[166:04.89]I'll be back.
[166:05.87]That's alright.
[166:06.27]I'll come back and just talk.
[166:07.03]Just let me know when you're ready.
[166:10.17]Alright.
[166:12.18]I'll be right back.
[166:12.58]I'm going to go pee.
[166:17.64]It's fun.
[166:18.28]I'm having a good time.
[166:19.88]I'll be right back.
[166:45.90]Thank you.
[168:06.26]you
[170:28.70]How are you?
[170:34.64]Alright, I think... I wonder if he is back.
[170:37.79]We'll find out.
[170:42.45]Are you back?
[170:46.73]I don't think Alex is back yet.
[170:49.25]We'll find out.
[171:00.63]Okay.
[171:04.89]We have not been kicked out of the game.
[171:06.05]That's good.
[171:08.61]Dude, you made a pecan pie.
[171:09.71]Are you serious?
[171:11.00]Hope it's good, man.
[171:17.46]Oh, by the way.
[171:18.14]Well, most people are here now.
[171:21.00]Tonight's the night.
[171:22.26]Nominations are opening up in Discord for the New Year's Eve Worst of the Year Awards.
[171:27.74]There's a bunch of categories this year.
[171:29.70]Some of them don't make any sense, and I have not done any of the things that are on the list, but whatever.
[171:37.87]Nominations will be open for about the next 10 days.
[171:43.03]If you have something that's part of that category that you know you want, make sure you get it in the nominations.
[171:50.38]And then somewhere around December 15th, December 16th, we will put up the official...
[171:59.51]and you can vote essentially all the way through into the end of December so keep an eye on the Discord over the next 24 hours that channel will be up it will be very specific rules so make sure you follow the rules advertising on my stream you're supposed to I'm supposed to be muted on you why am I even on your stream you're supposed to have muted me you unmuted to talk yeah yeah but I want you I should be deafened on your stream
[172:23.68]Yeah, but I turned it on in case you wanted to, like, I don't know, be entertaining or something.
[172:27.71]I don't know.
[172:28.33]That's not my responsibility.
[172:31.27]What the fuck, dude?
[172:32.91]Listen, I just... Oh, alright.
[172:37.09]I won't be able to force this one open.
[172:38.60]Alex, what's your favorite pie?
[172:45.27]Uh, put me on the spot.
[172:47.65]Depends.
[172:48.49]Sometimes, sometimes it's key lime, but not often.
[172:51.27]Whoa, you're a key lime pie guy?
[172:52.97]Sometimes.
[172:53.33]That's why I said context.
[172:55.38]That's actually, that's very surprising.
[172:57.02]Pecan.
[172:57.62]Pecan would be like always.
[172:59.40]Okay.
[173:00.24]Or pecan, depending on your regional preferences.
[173:03.36]Key lime is an interesting choice though.
[173:04.60]I don't know if I'd put that up there.
[173:08.79]That's why I said sometimes.
[173:10.97]We have to go this way somehow.
[173:12.03]If I had, like, a coffee, I feel like Key Lime is pretty good.
[173:17.13]Key Lime and coffee?
[173:18.11]What the fuck are you?
[173:19.55]Drugs are you on?
[173:23.30]Uh... How do we get in there?
[173:26.60]Key Lime may just be, like, a leftover memory from, like, a nostalgic, like, Olive Garden experience or something.
[173:32.60]Do they have Key Lime pie at Olive Garden?
[173:34.63]They probably do.
[173:36.67]Somebody's in here.
[173:37.61]Do we have to shoot a lock open?
[173:41.98]Homemade key lime with graham cracker crust.
[173:44.38]Yeah, that's a combo.
[173:47.28]Key lime has way too big of a range for me of it being awful to being very good.
[173:52.06]It really varies.
[173:54.80]I've had key lime pie before and it just tasted like fucking acid.
[173:58.89]But we have to weigh everything at their best, right?
[174:02.41]Like pumpkin pie at its best is still worse than pecan pie.
[174:08.82]I would have agreed with you, but I've recently had pumpkin pie.
[174:13.39]And it was cold.
[174:15.79]It was not hot.
[174:16.81]And I think that changed everything for me.
[174:20.51]What are we supposed to be doing here?
[174:22.31]Can we shoot that?
[174:23.11]We're supposed to be looking.
[174:25.75]We can look in through these.
[174:28.80]There was the blue box that you broke over here.
[174:31.72]That was just loot.
[174:32.90]Why would you eat a hot pumpkin pie?
[174:34.14]I don't know.
[174:34.48]Do you eat pumpkin pie hot?
[174:36.48]Who eats pumpkin pie hot?
[174:38.70]The only right way to eat pumpkin pie is with whipped cream on top.
[174:44.42]Like whip.
[174:47.86]I just pressed a bunch of buttons.
[174:50.71]Oh, there's a guy.
[174:51.37]Kill that guy.
[174:52.75]Okay, you got it.
[174:53.55]Okay, how about now?
[175:00.11]That one's open.
[175:01.21]What's the one on the end?
[175:04.35]You alright?
[175:05.23]Yeah.
[175:05.69]There was just a second guy.
[175:09.07]His head fell off.
[175:10.97]Whipped cream is not gross.
[175:12.23]Why would you say that?
[175:15.51]Whipped cream is amazing.
[175:18.25]Whipped cream is disgusting.
[175:19.97]I am fucking pissed right now.
[175:22.55]What?
[175:24.11]I'm seeing that a lot.
[175:25.27]I'm seeing people that keep saying it.
[175:29.30]It's because they're wrong.
[175:32.53]They just want to get... Try zero.
[175:36.37]Oh, no.
[175:36.63]We have to guess the number.
[175:38.07]It's a combination.
[175:38.89]There's a zero, a one, and a two in different orders.
[175:40.89]So it's not... The two's not at the end.
[175:43.49]Alright.
[175:44.30]102.
[175:44.50]That's a bad guy.
[175:47.02]I'll open the other one.
[175:47.80]What was it?
[175:48.24]Probably 201?
[175:48.98]He was taking a piss.
[175:52.72]He was on the pee break, too.
[175:53.74]Alright.
[175:55.64]They're all open.
[175:57.56]Yeah.
[175:57.70]Whipped cream is great.
[176:00.03]It's really light.
[176:01.74]It can go with anything.
[176:02.84]Whipped cream really goes with everything.
[176:10.43]I don't know.
[176:10.77]There's nobody behind us, right?
[176:13.96]No.
[176:14.24]Yeah, there is.
[176:27.67]One thing, listen, if I have to say something good about this game, it's that if they're going to throw 600 enemies, at least headshots actually kill, unlike every other Resident Evil game.
[176:41.29]Dude, I... Okay.
[176:45.57]Real whipped cream is great.
[176:49.07]I agree.
[176:49.51]Did I strike a nerve?
[176:51.40]I think all whipped cream is great.
[176:52.58]I don't know what's the hate to whipped cream.
[176:54.70]Am I muted right now?
[176:58.47]Oh, hey, you were muted for a second.
[176:59.47]Sorry.
[176:59.81]What were you saying?
[177:01.63]I was just saying.
[177:02.17]Make sure to get the thing in here.
[177:06.29]The only right way to eat whipped cream is 60-40 ratio.
[177:11.42]60% whipped cream.
[177:12.50]Oh, it's 2.
[177:13.38]Okay.
[177:17.18]It's 2.
[177:17.34]I don't know.
[177:18.28]2-1-0?
[177:18.50]Okay.
[177:19.04]I'm going to help you.
[177:24.82]The two is not at the end.
[177:26.53]Actually, it could be.
[177:28.13]No, it's definitely not.
[177:28.83]It's 2-1-0.
[177:29.15]Yeah, it is.
[177:29.43]C. Got it.
[177:42.92]Why would you say it like that?
[177:43.82]Like, I didn't... I wasn't disputing anything.
[177:46.06]No, no.
[177:46.98]I'm talking to chat, too.
[177:48.32]Chat is really being... They're saying that whipped cream is not that great.
[177:52.66]Real whipped cream.
[177:53.46]You didn't tell me.
[177:53.98]What's the best pie?
[177:56.02]The best pie?
[177:56.88]Yeah, you asked, well, what's the best pie?
[177:59.87]It's banana cream pie.
[178:02.29]That's a good pie, but you already know where I stand on this.
[178:04.81]And it doesn't matter.
[178:05.83]Banana pudding is superior?
[178:08.17]No, there's no crust, though.
[178:09.85]Don't open one something, too.
[178:12.41]I'm going to open 0 to 1.
[178:20.20]I think that was the right one.
[178:21.50]Banana cream pie.
[178:22.42]Banana cream pie and chocolate cream pie are my favorites.
[178:28.44]Okay.
[178:28.92]I can respect the chocolate cream pie.
[178:30.80]What about 1 to 0?
[178:31.70]If we want to get the loot, we have to open all the doors.
[178:36.34]Okay.
[178:36.82]Well, let's do it.
[178:38.12]But let me put a bomb in front of the big boys one.
[178:44.61]What was that about headshots a second ago?
[178:46.09]Oh, he morphed.
[178:51.40]Chocolate cream pie.
[178:52.06]I actually dodged.
[178:53.78]That's what you're supposed to do.
[178:54.96]I think... Don't worry, I got this.
[179:01.27]No, I'm laughing at the fact that auto-mod is deleting cream pie.
[179:11.30]not want you guys to say that word apparently oh how come listen we're not allowed to have whipped cream anymore we're not allowed to have cream pie anymore we can't all the words are being stolen from us I'm so sorry mods I just I find that very humorous alright two uh two oh one hold on hold on I'm gonna put a bomb right in front of this guy because this is like big boy okay if you open that one I'm ready one zero two
[179:38.41]Uh, that opened up something else.
[179:39.55]It's not even where we are.
[179:40.29]102?
[179:41.19]Yeah.
[179:41.49]Okay.
[179:51.94]Is he coming?
[179:53.66]Uh... He's coming.
[179:59.10]Nice!
[180:00.22]There we go.
[180:00.98]And then 201 or 210?
[180:01.89]What do you think?
[180:03.17]201? 201?
[180:07.95]He didn't die.
[180:10.11]2-1-0?
[180:10.25]Bro.
[180:16.71]Oops.
[180:17.75]I got a cutscene problem.
[180:18.87]Hold on.
[180:20.71]You alright?
[180:21.03]Wait.
[180:22.07]You can take cover?
[180:23.04]Yeah, but why is... What's the point?
[180:25.58]What is this mechanic?
[180:27.92]Oh, because we're gonna run into all the shooting zombies.
[180:31.24]Can I do more than... What have I not done?
[180:33.08]2-0-1?
[180:33.16]What...
[180:38.39]O-2-1?
[180:38.77]No, I think... Okay, it's... Yeah, because that one on the left can be... This one's got two codes.
[180:45.24]Yeah, it's probably... It's O-1-2.
[180:54.20]That's all of them.
[180:59.58]Yeah, banana cream pie is at the top.
[181:02.74]Chocolate cream pie is at the top as well.
[181:04.66]Somewhere there.
[181:07.24]I would not pick pie as a dessert.
[181:09.26]I think it's, like, pretty low for me.
[181:11.26]Wow.
[181:11.96]What about cobbler?
[181:13.88]That's kind of gross.
[181:14.70]Whatever.
[181:15.12]I don't think that's... I think that's gross, what you just said.
[181:18.00]Cobbler, like Alamode?
[181:22.00]Um, like a... I don't like fruits.
[181:25.32]I don't like warm fruit.
[181:26.48]Like, people think I'm crazy, but not like an apple pie.
[181:28.30]That's why Alamode.
[181:29.30]You get the hot and cold.
[181:32.12]No, no.
[181:33.14]It's just... I don't like it.
[181:34.32]Wow.
[181:34.97]I didn't know I was friends with a cobbler hater.
[181:37.51]It changes the dynamic.
[181:42.31]Ooh, nice.
[181:42.73]Yeah, I don't like apple pie.
[181:51.93]It seems like a messier pie.
[181:53.51]Well, pie just seems like a messier cake.
[181:55.20]So where do we draw the line?
[181:56.82]I don't like turnovers either, though.
[182:00.97]You don't like anything with fruit in it.
[182:02.51]No, I don't like warm fruit.
[182:04.17]It's like warm fruit filling.
[182:05.53]It kind of just reminds me of dog vomit or something.
[182:08.65]It's like human puke.
[182:10.18]I don't like it.
[182:13.20]Human puke?
[182:21.49]You have the appetite of a five-year-old.
[182:23.07]Because I don't like apple pie?
[182:25.33]Maybe you just haven't had a good one.
[182:26.67]Okay, apple pie is only good with ice cream.
[182:29.31]But then so is cobbler.
[182:30.65]And most fruit-based.
[182:32.21]Yeah, but are we going to judge the merits of a dessert based on adding another dessert to make it better?
[182:37.25]If you allow whipped cream, you have to.
[182:40.63]No, I don't think so.
[182:41.71]That's a secondary thing.
[182:43.19]Then we have to judge everything with no whipped cream.
[182:45.51]That's fine.
[182:46.52]Banana cream pie without the whipped cream is fine.
[182:49.14]Oh, wait a minute.
[182:50.28]Wait a minute, it's actually not.
[182:52.90]Yeah, first of all, it's not.
[182:54.28]Second of all, cream is in the name.
[182:58.62]Cobbler a la mode.
[183:00.28]That's a whole ass dessert.
[183:01.77]Why do you order five of those from McDonald's?
[183:03.51]I don't.
[183:04.29]I don't order five apple pies.
[183:05.67]Yeah, but a McDonald's apple pie is good.
[183:13.01]A good banana cream pie is very simple to make, but it's impossible to master.
[183:17.55]People go, oh, I've got the best banana cream pie, son.
[183:21.51]Have it.
[183:22.32]And it's dog shit.
[183:23.22]It's fucking disgusting.
[183:25.59]I've had... I'm serious.
[183:27.95]I've had banana cream pie that was like mealy and mushy and it was supposed to be my secret recipe.
[183:33.22]It was awful.
[183:33.66]I like it, but I wouldn't put it that high.
[183:43.93]I think this is, I think tiramisu and the banana cream pie share a kinship, which is a million different tiramisu's exist, but really like 1% of them are like 10 out of 10.
[183:54.29]That's what I mean.
[183:54.83]Like it's, it's, it's really hard to gauge some of these desserts because sometimes they can be made so poorly.
[184:06.26]It's also, it's also like, you know, that's how I judge streams.
[184:08.82]Like 99% of them are shit, but like the 1% that are good, you know.
[184:14.35]Those are the ones that get mean.
[184:17.39]I hope you're talking about this one.
[184:20.73]Are we in the 1%?
[184:21.37]Come on, where are you?
[184:29.78]Who knows?
[184:30.56]Time will tell.
[184:31.48]I'm just waiting for people to...
[184:37.70]You can go ahead and make the joke if you want.
[184:40.24]Jerma for fuck's sake, manage your inventory.
[184:43.72]Where is there an inventory?
[184:45.22]What are you talking about?
[184:46.36]Manage my inventory?
[184:49.22]Where?
[184:56.65]Over there.
[184:58.65]Are they pointing at the screen?
[185:00.25]I don't know.
[185:00.57]Someone got really mad.
[185:02.37]There is no inventory.
[185:03.27]This is Resident Evil 6.
[185:06.38]I just made some more crunchies.
[185:10.43]To resurrect you if later.
[185:11.47]Hold on.
[185:11.81]Nice.
[185:16.81]Manage it!
[185:20.71]Elbow drop.
[185:25.94]Oh shit!
[185:26.36]Imagine if I thought that was a person.
[185:30.54]Woah, real time reflections in 2012?
[185:36.21]Oh, there's actually treasure in the sink.
[185:40.43]You missed it.
[185:41.91]So, can I just put a shitload of this in?
[185:44.15]I have 12 of these now.
[185:48.36]What did you say?
[185:49.50]Oh, shit.
[185:49.84]I did miss that.
[185:50.36]I had to drain the sink.
[185:59.28]Hey!
[185:59.86]Watch out.
[186:00.20]Don't blow that up when I'm standing next to it.
[186:04.38]Like that?
[186:04.91]But I thought you were far enough away to not get hurt.
[186:08.29]I actually shot it.
[186:09.65]It could have been me.
[186:12.05]Someone just asked me if I saw the dollhouse streams.
[186:14.92]I'm currently playing.
[186:18.40]Hey, dude, you see those streams, man?
[186:19.94]Did you see those dollhouse streams?
[186:25.74]Well, what if you didn't?
[186:26.64]Maybe you didn't.
[186:28.28]You may have been busy.
[186:28.98]I don't know.
[186:34.76]Is an item over here, I think.
[186:36.18]Don't ask what I'm doing over here.
[186:38.38]I don't want to talk about it.
[186:39.36]You have to activate a thing.
[186:52.51]What am I looking at?
[186:55.00]Of course I did.
[186:56.78]Who do you think I am?
[186:59.74]Oh, you've watched Dollhouse Dream?
[187:00.72]Okay, name every Dollhouse character.
[187:04.89]There's the the Princess Diana one.
[187:07.09]I can't even he can't even he doesn't even know The only characters I saw were the The staff really they're the only ones who showed up the people in the blackout suits not even a real fan Gatekeeping
[187:38.70]Somebody said, put it in emote only quick.
[187:40.74]I don't care about this story.
[187:41.70]You could spoil the whole thing for me right now.
[187:44.78]Happy birthday.
[187:46.10]I said happy birthday.
[187:52.01]It is a happy birthday, yeah.
[187:57.43]Now we get to watch somebody else watching home videos.
[188:01.90]It's a C virus.
[188:02.58]Alright, we have to be quiet.
[188:03.68]This is important.
[188:08.46]Why did you add Jerma Wild 2, but not 1, 3, and 4?
[188:11.72]Because it's a four-part emote, and it would just be annoying to look at.
[188:14.60]It's too much.
[188:16.95]It's like my arm.
[188:19.41]Plus, you would probably use 4 as a dick.
[188:21.61]So, do I really have to tell you why?
[188:24.09]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[188:28.96]Tell me 1, 3, and 4 is not a big dick, and fine.
[188:31.82]And then I will concede.
[188:37.28]We're talking about an emote?
[188:40.36]Oh my god, it's... I don't know how that is.
[188:41.96]Do you know how that is?
[188:48.19]Um... No, I... That's not Ada.
[188:52.66]Is it Ada?
[188:53.66]Is it Ada?
[188:54.08]No.
[188:59.40]Wait, are we having like a turn on each other moment?
[189:02.30]Like that's fucked up.
[189:04.00]We went through all this to watch this birthday video.
[189:07.59]Oh my god, look at these things are gonna break open.
[189:12.85]Tell me you're playing a Resident Evil game without telling me you're playing a Resident Evil game.
[189:16.85]Okay.
[189:17.91]Things in tubes.
[189:19.51]Leon!
[189:20.86]Help!
[189:23.26]Did I win?
[189:24.68]Was that a Helena impression?
[189:26.66]No.
[189:29.16]That was just Duke Nukem.
[189:34.65]That was just literally Duke Nukem talking.
[189:37.91]Oh, sorry.
[189:38.99]I think I won that one.
[189:44.06]I think we're supposed to go over here.
[189:48.16]Oh, why is it... Is there anything in here?
[189:57.75]Listen, it's me, Matthew Mercer.
[190:00.85]We have to go this way.
[190:03.26]No, say like we're all at a bubble gum, but I'm going to kick your ass anyways, kid, whatever it is.
[190:07.32]Say the other one.
[190:09.52]Open the door.
[190:11.28]I can't.
[190:12.14]Why can't you open this door?
[190:13.24]I can't.
[190:17.97]The hell?
[190:21.78]Oh, it's two.
[190:22.44]It's a stat.
[190:23.10]Hold on.
[190:23.42]It's 201.
[190:24.22]I'll be right back.
[190:25.00]Oh, you gotta punch the code in.
[190:26.92]There's a computer thing.
[190:27.74]Gotta remember the room key.
[190:29.32]There it is.
[190:29.66]No, it's not.
[190:32.73]Why is this dude covered in honey?
[190:35.55]They're gonna get up.
[190:36.81]We have to go back to that kiosk thing?
[190:40.37]Are they gonna get up?
[190:41.23]Or is this like a set up for the enemies you're gonna fight later thing?
[190:45.57]Oh, no, I can't open this.
[190:47.85]So, we need the computer.
[190:52.34]Somebody give me a Duke Nukem line in chat, please.
[190:57.01]He needs to say it.
[190:59.03]It's 201, but we don't have a...
[191:01.58]I'm here to kick ass and chew bubblegum.
[191:06.10]And I'm all out of fucking time.
[191:08.97]Let's get the fuck out of here.
[191:10.19]You know, if you committed to that, it would have been great.
[191:13.19]That was close.
[191:14.11]That was very good.
[191:15.63]But you lost commitment near the middle and the end?
[191:17.91]Because I'm ready.
[191:18.49]I'm just paying like on a phone call with mom during a Will Ferrell movie.
[191:21.61]We're just walking back and forth in the same room.
[191:23.47]201.
[191:23.69]Got it.
[191:24.93]Good work.
[191:28.68]That was a callback.
[191:33.76]Do you remember you being an asshole?
[191:36.63]No, I'm not.
[191:37.35]I think some people are just soft.
[191:44.79]Okay, so let's work together.
[191:45.91]Hang on, I can jump over this.
[191:54.50]You are.
[191:55.10]Cool wax projects.
[192:02.25]This is a really long Will Ferrell movie, when does it end?
[192:06.29]It's like three, yeah it's been four hours.
[192:11.71]I'm starting to think you're right about the fighting of these guys.
[192:21.28]No, Netflix just kept playing the next Will Ferrell movie in your queue.
[192:30.53]and it was dad's home too get ready for a real god real exciting movie I think we activate the passageways uh we can go through here I think how do you crouch uh I don't think you can I think yeah you can I think
[192:59.45]Sorry, doggos, but they're just going to fight us later for sure.
[193:08.81]It's on the other side of this grate.
[193:17.49]What the fuck?
[193:18.01]I can't go in here?
[193:18.81]Don't you feel like you can go in there?
[193:21.02]There's a whole hallway over here.
[193:22.16]Did I just pull you?
[193:25.66]You did not.
[193:26.06]I'm still looking at the vents.
[193:29.31]You are?
[193:30.51]Yeah.
[193:31.51]It's showing me where to go.
[193:33.01]I know where to go.
[193:36.31]Come up here.
[193:37.27]There's a whole hallway we just looked past.
[193:39.20]Like right here.
[193:40.72]Oh, alright.
[193:42.48]And there's two levers on this level on the opposite side over there.
[193:47.86]Okay.
[193:48.36]But I have to pull this lever, which has a high probability of causing problems.
[193:53.28]So that gets us back out here.
[193:55.98]I get it.
[193:57.26]We have to activate them one by one.
[193:59.64]I get it.
[194:01.53]We have to stretch this level out because we spent a lot of time on the art assets.
[194:07.19]Watch out!
[194:12.49]God.
[194:12.97]Oh my goodness.
[194:17.97]Oh my god.
[194:18.65]Oh my goodness.
[194:19.41]Oh my gosh.
[194:21.39]It's getting crazy.
[194:30.04]Uh, where are you?
[194:31.62]Pulling the next lever.
[194:33.46]You just... You just... I'm locked in here now.
[194:40.31]I'm not... Okay, I'm not gonna do that.
[194:42.13]You locked me in here.
[194:44.37]I'm not locked in here with you!
[194:47.49]Etcetera.
[194:48.71]No.
[194:49.61]No.
[194:50.19]No!
[194:52.85]Don't... No!
[195:02.96]Stop being such a sussy baka.
[195:14.28]Ban that person and ban their entire family.
[195:18.32]I want to make sure nobody from their entire family shows up because they're going to be kind of like that person and I don't want to ever see them or anybody that's like them.
[195:24.72]Why am I sniping?
[195:34.57]You will not silence us.
[195:36.97]Alright, I looked around, I'm back on your side.
[195:40.21]These people can just take a million bullets.
[195:42.33]Why?
[195:45.33]What the fuck?
[195:52.48]Okay.
[195:53.32]So now we can go this way.
[195:54.30]Yeah, we gotta go across.
[195:57.30]Which gives us the up.
[196:00.94]Thank you.
[196:01.28]Mm-hmm.
[196:04.62]Got to reload.
[196:06.16]Okay.
[196:09.98]How are you doing?
[196:11.27]They are definitely getting stronger.
[196:12.55]Okay.
[196:14.15]It's not what a sniper is for.
[196:17.57]What lever is that?
[196:18.95]I just pulled it.
[196:20.17]I think it's the way to get across.
[196:21.01]Alright.
[196:26.91]I love how self-referential this game is.
[196:28.35]Why does everything have to be so complicated?
[196:29.57]That's what I'm saying as a player.
[196:33.19]Oh, right here.
[196:37.05]Wait, I need to help you get in the elevator?
[196:38.73]Oh, okay.
[196:41.09]There are people up there.
[196:42.03]Yeah, sorry.
[196:46.81]Oh, now we got a big guy.
[196:50.10]I think I'll snipe.
[196:54.06]See if I can help you.
[196:56.60]That's a shotgun.
[196:59.32]Shit.
[197:05.56]Sniping!
[197:06.26]You okay?
[197:15.00]Yep.
[197:24.90]Ow, ow.
[197:26.64]I'm trying to help.
[197:35.30]There's electricity I guess.
[197:37.34]I think you activated it maybe.
[197:38.88]Yeah you shoot the transformer.
[197:43.27]What do I have to do?
[197:44.37]There's two levers.
[197:45.85]I think that now lets me come over to your side.
[197:50.39]Oh boy.
[197:50.75]I think you're in trouble.
[197:53.58]You're in trouble.
[197:54.52]That's your side I think.
[197:56.76]No it's my side.
[197:58.68]I got this.
[198:02.44]I had the same idea.
[198:05.31]I'll throw mine.
[198:06.03]Those are credited to me.
[198:09.33]No kill stealing.
[198:10.95]There's no timer, right?
[198:11.89]I feel like this I hear a blinking like dun dun dun.
[198:16.59]Alright, nice.
[198:16.99]Let's go.
[198:17.33]A lot of shit over here.
[198:21.39]I get it.
[198:23.37]Very cool.
[198:23.81]Nice job, dude.
[198:24.49]Nice work.
[198:26.11]Yeah, we did it.
[198:27.11]First try.
[198:31.33]How long is this game?
[198:33.45]This is the Leon section.
[198:37.84]So it's pretty long.
[198:41.02]The 30 hour game.
[198:43.94]It's like 40 hours.
[198:44.98]Why?
[198:45.64]That's way too long.
[198:50.21]They just started developing and then couldn't stop and then just added 16 waves to each arena that they made.
[198:58.85]I was going to shoot you too.
[198:59.89]That's poor shit.
[199:02.99]There are four different campaigns.
[199:07.68]And you will be able to see those campaigns if you decide to buy this game when it goes on Steam.
[199:13.42]Every year for like three dollars.
[199:15.22]Screamer.
[199:32.18]Really?
[199:33.18]I thought he was dead.
[199:38.20]Sniped over your shoulder.
[199:39.16]You're welcome.
[199:40.10]Thanks.
[199:40.32]Uh oh.
[199:42.32]Help me out.
[199:46.28]Whoa!
[199:46.68]He turned to ice?
[199:48.17]He had a nitrogen tank or whatever it was.
[199:54.09]I'm clearly the sniper of the group.
[199:55.61]That's fine.
[199:56.21]I'll be the melee guy.
[199:56.75]I think we have to open this door.
[200:00.38]Yep.
[200:01.70]Is it like a dual?
[200:03.14]It's a double.
[200:09.35]this campaign has the best story what's the story I like the part where they release the virus and the entire city engulfs in flames you know what who has a harder life a civilian in a Resident Evil franchise or like in the Marvel universe because I feel like in both the city is constantly exploded and nobody ever has to like actually clean up
[200:33.41]I haven't seen Marvel for sure because like somebody can literally just drop like a Kamehameha on you and kill like fucking a million people.
[200:43.00]Yeah, I like that part in Spider-Man.
[200:46.60]I mean, literally the plot of Infinity War is... Alright, spoilers for Infinity War if you haven't seen the fucking goddamn movie by this point.
[200:54.68]But like the whole plot of Infinity War is that everybody dies, right?
[201:00.97]Like I in I'm the spoiler for if you haven't seen infinity war then okay, you don't watch television Look if you put me into like a grocery store, and I have like 500 cans of shit Boyardee, and I put boards up What like mister mister like electricity man is not gonna be able to get into the building oh?
[201:25.13]Right, right.
[201:26.88]Like, I'll be fine.
[201:27.98]Like, I don't know.
[201:28.98]I just worry about zombies.
[201:30.54]Yeah, but this is a pathogen that infects everybody.
[201:34.68]Possibly in the entire world.
[201:38.38]Like, there's four campaigns.
[201:39.54]You don't know.
[201:39.86]This could be like a globetrotting... Yeah, but, okay.
[201:44.04]Who's that little, that guy that's like, Oh, yes.
[201:46.38]Oh, you're a wizard too.
[201:47.20]I am.
[201:47.52]Me as well.
[201:49.02]Oh, I'm going to torture you.
[201:50.31]That's Professor Quirrell.
[201:51.37]No, no, no, no.
[201:51.87]He's in the Marvel movies.
[201:52.65]It's that guy like, Oh, yeah.
[201:54.15]He puts his hands up and he moves his hands around.
[201:55.57]People fly around and shit.
[201:56.43]It's like the Doctor Strange fight.
[201:59.95]Oh, yes, Thanos.
[202:00.69]I am your most lovely lieutenant.
[202:03.46]They call him like the Maw, right?
[202:06.78]I'm afraid of that guy.
[202:07.96]I'm not afraid of a zombie.
[202:10.08]Maybe I can run away from Mr. X.
[202:19.68]If Ma puts his hand up and points at me, 500 light poles are going to stab me through the chest.
[202:27.51]Like, it's different.
[202:28.13]We don't have space-faring technology that I know of in Resident Evil.
[202:31.39]But, like, in Marvel, they could just run away.
[202:34.91]Like, Thanos still can't go faster than light.
[202:36.97]He has to, like, catch you.
[202:38.04]You could just... You ever see the best Star Wars movie, The Last Jedi?
[202:41.42]You know how the ships are just constantly, like, running away from each other?
[202:44.12]It's just one long spaceship chase.
[202:45.58]It could be like that.
[202:46.40]You just really have to say Star Wars.
[202:59.42]My brain just shrank to the size of a pea.
[203:01.36]Communication between the two main characters will be great.
[203:20.43]Anos has the stones.
[203:21.57]That's what I mean.
[203:22.35]Anos has some big stones.
[203:24.13]Alright, so wait.
[203:27.45]You have to carry and I have to fight?
[203:28.61]Do I have bullets?
[203:32.26]Okay, I got enough.
[203:33.04]Let me set up for this.
[203:34.54]I feel like this is going to be hard.
[203:44.24]Then he says something like the hardest of choices requires the largest of stones.
[203:50.62]stones yes I I will get the stones yes stones what movie is that from I'll give you 100 say it again the stones yes I'll get the stones don't look at chat better don't look at chat you have 10 seconds
[204:18.17]Oh wait, you can't fight.
[204:19.01]Sorry.
[204:19.37]Can you help me?
[204:19.91]I'm on the ground.
[204:20.33]You need to turn around right now, otherwise we have to start over.
[204:22.97]Can you not help?
[204:35.70]I'm gonna precarious stream position.
[204:37.45]I'm dead Okay, I don't he killed me.
[204:40.83]I'm gonna okay.
[204:41.67]I'm in a very bad stream position like I don't you need to come over here and help me yeah, but Just click on me How do I put this person down just jump up jump up over the edge I
[204:58.03]I thought you actually went over.
[204:59.35]I can't.
[205:00.57]I literally don't know how to put this person down.
[205:02.99]And also... Do I have a heal?
[205:05.71]Oh, shit.
[205:06.23]I just healed.
[205:06.73]I'm fine.
[205:09.26]I can't left click right now.
[205:10.42]So you can't... Okay, so I can't go down again.
[205:12.40]Good to know.
[205:13.44]It's very important that I don't left click as much as possible.
[205:16.76]So where are we heading?
[205:18.60]This way.
[205:19.32]This person really should have thought about their wardrobe before they came into the sewers beneath the church.
[205:27.39]Get over here.
[205:34.09]I also can't pick any items up.
[205:36.39]Where the fuck are you?
[205:37.65]I'm right behind you.
[205:38.41]I'm following.
[205:43.34]I'm not paying a single attention to anything that you've said in like the last 10 to 30 seconds.
[205:47.12]The roof is caving in.
[205:48.70]I said... Don't worry about it.
[205:50.42]Turn around.
[205:52.54]Me?
[205:54.04]I'm following you.
[205:54.84]I thought you were going the other way.
[205:56.78]I've been right behind you the whole... Okay.
[206:00.30]There's a guy right behind you.
[206:01.30]I base where you are based on gunshots.
[206:02.86]Like when I hear them.
[206:03.92]Whoa.
[206:04.94]Yeah, that's the guy.
[206:09.38]The guy's got a machete.
[206:15.13]Alright, we good?
[206:17.41]Nope, there's a guy in here.
[206:22.65]Good.
[206:28.15]Shoot people in the knees for fast melee finishers.
[206:30.47]That's actually a good idea.
[206:38.68]Does it bother you when people say, like, melee?
[206:40.50]I used to say it like that.
[206:44.56]Then you change.
[206:47.33]Like melee?
[206:47.97]Yeah, melee.
[206:48.57]That actually is a great idea.
[206:55.45]I'm going to start doing that.
[207:01.11]Nobody, nobody, nobody.
[207:04.95]Wait, did you play?
[207:13.15]Did you play Resident Elite?
[207:16.16]What is the big vampire lady's name?
[207:20.70]Lady Dimitrescu.
[207:21.96]OK, never mind.
[207:23.76]Got him.
[207:25.36]I thought it was Dimitrescu.
[207:29.25]Yeah, you didn't watch the developer blogs.
[207:33.15]Like I did.
[207:40.47]Lady Dimitrescu.
[207:45.13]Was I supposed to push it for that long?
[207:46.71]He just wouldn't stop.
[207:49.27]You opened up the path.
[207:49.93]There's a person here.
[207:52.34]And I am useless.
[207:53.88]Well, you're carrying... I'm very strong.
[207:55.70]I'm very strong.
[207:57.35]And I can run as fast as you with a second person on my shoulders.
[208:00.49]I'm not doing the thing that the person in chat said to do.
[208:04.35]Usually a good idea.
[208:06.74]Lady Terimisu.
[208:08.24]It looks like Dimitrisu.
[208:12.58]This is a boss arena.
[208:23.46]Oh, no.
[208:24.24]I just assume everyone's infected.
[208:27.31]She's the boss.
[208:30.11]Oh, shit.
[208:30.55]She is the boss.
[208:31.09]You're right.
[208:37.73]Never mind.
[208:40.71]Possible.
[208:41.59]Still possible.
[208:43.43]Losing probability right now.
[208:46.92]Coming back.
[208:48.24]Swinging back around.
[208:55.54]Oh, whoa.
[208:57.12]Someone's been watching too many Ridley Scott movies.
[209:00.26]That's actually kind of cool.
[209:02.58]I'm not kidding when I say that's kind of cool.
[209:05.91]It's like this skeleton kind of gets like born.
[209:14.05]It's like a snake shedding its skin.
[209:18.30]Ada.
[209:20.94]Ada.
[209:23.58]Ada, can you speak up?
[209:24.78]I can't hear you.
[209:29.37]I watched your birthday video, Ada, and I didn't like it.
[209:32.59]It feels like you wouldn't want to wear, like, a bright colored clothes here.
[209:35.69]Wouldn't you be able to get seen, like, really easily?
[209:38.69]It's to avoid friendly fire.
[209:39.75]Zombies' vision is based on movement.
[209:42.14]Is it?
[209:42.78]Ada, what the hell is going on here?
[209:46.12]It's complicated.
[209:51.94]I could explain, or we could go to the next set piece.
[209:53.94]Your choice.
[209:56.22]But this isn't the time or the place.
[210:02.30]These walkways won't hold.
[210:04.04]We need to get to the lower levels.
[210:05.38]I'm so sorry, Debra!
[210:07.00]What the fuck?
[210:07.98]It's all my fault!
[210:09.36]Helena!
[210:10.14]Get away from her!
[210:11.96]Helena!
[210:12.52]She's still the boss!
[210:15.27]What?
[210:15.91]Helena, please.
[210:16.99]Woah!
[210:18.83]Break dancing, boss.
[210:20.27]Um... Okay.
[210:24.37]Alright, you gotta shoot the edges.
[210:25.45]Zombie boobs.
[210:28.05]I gotta... Are you alive?
[210:29.01]What am I not?
[210:29.51]Gonna say anything?
[210:34.26]What did you just do to us?
[210:44.75]I got Ada on my team.
[210:45.83]I'll be good.
[210:49.31]It's okay.
[210:50.67]I don't need any help.
[210:56.09]Everybody knows in Resident Evil games, friendly NPCs only hold you back.
[211:00.61]Is Ada?
[211:00.79]Ada just killed like three people.
[211:08.07]Wait, I need to combine some shit.
[211:09.23]Okay.
[211:19.95]Jump to this?
[211:20.75]I thought that was a grenade.
[211:35.68]Don't get the wrong idea.
[211:37.06]It'll make sense later.
[211:39.04]Okay.
[211:40.72]Okay, coming down.
[211:41.62]Oh, she gave you a ring?
[211:44.10]Putting that in my fanfic later.
[211:47.90]If you shoot her, if you don't shoot her, whatever.
[211:56.68]What are you doing down there?
[211:57.57]I am at a lever that I can now fold.
[212:05.69]Because it's going to help.
[212:09.65]This is actually a Demon's Souls drop down.
[212:15.28]This is the Demon's Souls round tunnel.
[212:19.78]Oh shit.
[212:20.60]Alright, defeat mutated Debra.
[212:24.26]Let's go.
[212:34.96]We've got her.
[212:38.00]Well, it never said she had superpowers.
[212:39.50]She was just slightly mutated.
[212:43.03]When you're mutant, you can take five bullets instead of one, like a normal wimpy human.
[212:46.63]In the back.
[212:50.19]Okay.
[212:51.13]Shoot.
[212:51.89]What the hell?
[212:53.37]You should put her down.
[212:55.16]Do you have any sympathy for her?
[212:56.56]I love how in the cutscene, I'm like, no, please spare her.
[212:58.94]But now I'm playing, and I'm just shooting her.
[213:05.16]Oh shit.
[213:05.86]Alright, now we gotta get the edges.
[213:06.78]Ow.
[213:06.86]What do you do?
[213:09.94]Don't shoot the glowy bits.
[213:15.94]For massive... Damage.
[213:19.80]Get up!
[213:21.81]I actually can't.
[213:23.09]Shit!
[213:23.61]What the fuck?
[213:26.59]They're not holding still.
[213:28.09]Okay.
[213:29.65]There's explosive barrels on the ground.
[213:32.71]There are.
[213:34.79]There are barrels in the ground.
[213:35.77]You're right.
[213:36.13]Nice.
[213:36.77]Let's get those when we have a chance here.
[213:40.48]She's standing right next to me.
[213:42.52]Nice.
[213:44.34]Nice, dude.
[213:45.30]Nice.
[213:47.76]Got one more leg to get.
[213:49.54]Nice.
[213:55.12]One more right there.
[213:55.83]Nice.
[213:57.87]Nice, dude.
[213:58.89]Keep going.
[213:59.29]Keep going.
[213:59.55]Keep going.
[214:05.00]Reloading.
[214:07.02]If you stand next to one of the other barrels, she'll jump to the barrel.
[214:10.46]Nice, dude.
[214:11.44]That's a good idea.
[214:13.16]Back it up.
[214:15.21]Maybe not.
[214:22.07]Okay, she's not really doing it, but... Oh, that's a great idea.
[214:29.01]Definitely weak to fire.
[214:31.67]Big DPS.
[214:32.15]Yes.
[214:34.15]There's more.
[214:37.57]I think they separated us.
[214:41.12]Are you in health?
[214:42.70]Nice.
[214:43.06]How did I miss that so close?
[214:46.28]I don't understand.
[214:47.12]How am I doing that?
[215:05.22]Oh, there's a lot of... I got that one.
[215:09.06]You... You threw it at me.
[215:11.42]I didn't throw anything.
[215:12.25]I have a sniper rifle.
[215:16.79]Alright, most of the bottom.
[215:17.91]41 extra bullets?
[215:19.83]Why do you have so many bullets?
[215:20.83]Why?
[215:21.57]That's a ton of sniper bullets.
[215:23.09]Use them.
[215:24.71]I just noticed that I had them.
[215:26.33]We have an AFK this whole time?
[215:34.89]Oh my fucking God.
[215:37.19]I don't know what you did, but it hurt.
[215:39.73]I didn't do it.
[215:40.41]I'm blaming everything.
[215:43.41]I'm blaming everything on you.
[215:45.41]I'm this close.
[215:47.15]Just come on down where I can reach you.
[215:48.44]Alright, but I'm afraid to move.
[215:52.50]You got to hurry.
[215:53.18]I'm like two stories below you.
[215:54.56]You're supposed to be running around while I stand here on the elevator.
[215:57.88]You're the guy that kicked the stairs.
[216:00.62]The ceiling collapsed on my head.
[216:02.34]I got to get my steps in.
[216:10.47]Ada is just shooting- what the hell?
[216:13.09]She's shooting crossbow bolts at seeming random.
[216:17.99]There's so much of what- I have so much ground I need to cover.
[216:20.83]Don't shoot the guy when he's in the middle of his cutscene to animate the stand up.
[216:26.63]Like, everything's just shaking?
[216:28.55]I'm coming, I'm here.
[216:29.39]I don't know if it's supposed to be stopped.
[216:30.59]I'm about to turn it off.
[216:33.89]Alright, I'm turning it off.
[216:35.49]Thank you, please.
[216:39.97]Thank you for moving me.
[216:42.83]Okay.
[216:43.57]You're the guy that just went out.
[216:44.73]It's raining.
[216:45.39]And you're like, I'll go get the car.
[216:47.17]Don't worry.
[216:49.17]You guys stay here.
[216:50.99]Hey, I got it, didn't I?
[216:52.61]I still can't get out of here.
[216:56.51]I got it, didn't I?
[216:58.90]Oh, you have to jump in.
[217:00.94]All aboard.
[217:04.86]Oh, goodness.
[217:05.80]This is not good.
[217:07.32]Duck!
[217:08.88]How do you duck?
[217:10.32]I don't know how to duck.
[217:12.48]Why did that not hit you?
[217:14.61]Oh, my fucking god.
[217:15.69]Okay, what is it?
[217:16.33]Space?
[217:16.73]What?
[217:17.03]I'm just staying down.
[217:17.87]Fuck it.
[217:18.21]Stay down.
[217:18.45]I'm staying down.
[217:21.01]How do I- What hit me the second time?
[217:25.38]I'm getting too angry.
[217:30.09]They really need a safety team out here on this new universal ride.
[217:32.83]This is dangerous.
[217:34.09]It's so low.
[217:34.89]We're going to have to duck again, aren't we?
[217:45.87]Thank God we both all fell.
[217:47.63]Get her off the front.
[217:53.01]Alright, having 50 sniper bullets here is less than ideal.
[217:59.55]Alright, run her over.
[218:08.41]I'm sitting down.
[218:08.99]I'm not getting hit in the head.
[218:12.67]We good?
[218:15.38]Um... Yes.
[218:16.58]You got it.
[218:32.27]The tracks are going to run out.
[218:36.29]I would say that's probably a good assessment of what's going to happen here.
[218:40.79]Green guts.
[218:44.27]What the?
[218:45.40]Shit.
[218:50.50]Step down.
[218:52.32]I'm staying down.
[218:53.16]I'm not getting up.
[218:54.58]I don't care.
[218:55.70]Explosion hurt less than the... I say it.
[219:00.06]Good job because you didn't...
[219:05.67]Defeat Deborah.
[219:10.50]Is she defeated?
[219:11.82]Oh, she's here.
[219:13.44]No, I want to combine that.
[219:14.45]Alright, good job.
[219:18.89]You're doing great.
[219:20.43]Just...
[219:35.14]Have you been hit in the head this way?
[219:36.40]Have you been hit in the head as a child?
[219:37.84]Where are you supposed to shoot?
[219:43.15]I think I have to save.
[219:45.13]Help me.
[219:47.03]Thank you.
[219:47.43]I think I just chose to save you and just let Ada die.
[219:49.61]I don't even see Ada.
[219:58.65]I can't be the one that kills her.
[220:00.72]It would be a question of conscience.
[220:03.48]I have to save you.
[220:05.44]No, she's fine.
[220:06.00]No, it's fine.
[220:07.78]If you just... Okay, everybody knows that the way to defeat the virus is enough bullets.
[220:11.26]Not until I avenge your death.
[220:13.40]If you shoot this person long enough, they'll turn back from zombie into human.
[220:17.55]Please.
[220:19.59]I know you're in there.
[220:20.35]That was the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
[220:23.49]This is Resident Evil.
[220:30.70]I was gonna think of something funny to say after that to like make it look like that was me like saying that was funny.
[220:36.12]But like I just couldn't think of anything afterwards so it just made it just sounded like I just said you were dumb.
[220:42.55]I'm sorry I did not mean it like that.
[220:44.65]I was trying to think of something funny to say.
[220:46.91]Yeah but I was just making fun of the game so you just said the game is because that's what happened that's what's happening right now.
[220:52.94]Alright, let's see what they have to say.
[220:53.86]Oh, they're related.
[220:54.70]See, that changes the whole dynamic.
[220:55.89]No, we knew that before, didn't we?
[221:18.60]I didn't know.
[221:20.28]Was I supposed to?
[221:21.18]I think we knew that before.
[221:21.96]I have amnesia.
[221:23.20]Name five characters in the game.
[221:24.71]Okay.
[221:24.83]Leon.
[221:24.97]Ada.
[221:25.07]Deborah.
[221:28.21]Helena.
[221:28.47]Wesker.
[221:28.75]I don't think Wesker's in this.
[221:42.93]He's in every game, isn't he?
[221:44.93]He's definitely in like a lore document at least.
[221:46.65]We're up against the people who really run this country.
[221:51.66]In a very dangerous game.
[221:55.42]Well, that's not fair because there's only five characters in the game.
[222:07.46]Leon, where are you?
[222:08.75]Simmons there.
[222:10.91]Simmons is 5.
[222:13.45]Hunnigan.
[222:14.03]Okay.
[222:19.13]We were in a voice call with someone, but someone on video call overheard us.
[222:24.54]I guess.
[222:27.38]By the way, Leon.
[222:29.22]What happened?
[222:33.12]Well.
[222:33.32]You got an A rank.
[222:34.04]So, you know, good job.
[222:36.50]That's double A. What was the weapon that you were using for the most part?
[222:40.89]I mean, I was a sniper, remember?
[222:42.85]Nice, you get to zoom in and just put it on somebody's back.
[222:51.44]Yeah, that sucked.
[222:52.76]That chapter was awful.
[222:53.48]Alright, this is important.
[222:58.66]But I liked it better than being stuck outside the mansion five times in a row.
[223:05.32]Because at least we got a cool minecart segment.
[223:08.80]actually I'm all jokes aside I'm actually having this is actually a fun game I actually don't care I mean it's not a good game but I'm having fun with the game as far as like Resident Evils go I think this game aged better because it came on the heels of Resident Evil 5. I mean resident 5 is way better by like a thousand percent that's what I mean there's been time to breathe and we can acknowledge that it's shitty and like play it on purpose and uh enjoy it in spite of itself
[223:39.44]I got money.
[223:39.88]We got money.
[223:40.43]What's important here?
[223:41.55]It's not melee.
[223:42.25]Melee is... Actually, maybe it is.
[223:43.73]Oh, here's the thing.
[223:44.27]You have to decide whether to drop one of your three or upgrade one of the existing ones for, like, more.
[223:50.49]Like, I have crit that I can upgrade to level two.
[223:54.87]Oh, I would probably want to... Who cares about breakout?
[223:58.57]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[224:07.19]I have to do it.
[224:08.12]How much more damage does the melee do?
[224:10.14]Is it significant?
[224:13.66]That's a lot of money.
[224:20.25]Not significant?
[224:21.11]It only affects the knife.
[224:22.17]Oh, that's awful.
[224:22.81]You're saying... A critical hit sounds good.
[224:26.95]Rock steady?
[224:27.37]No.
[224:27.43]No.
[224:39.22]Eagle Eye.
[224:41.80]If I'm going to do Sniper, there's a... That magnification.
[224:47.28]I only have 8,000.
[224:48.20]I spent all my money.
[224:54.19]I don't know what to do.
[224:57.43]I'm dropping Breakout.
[224:59.39]We're just not getting grabbed.
[225:01.63]How do you get rid of it?
[225:03.43]You have to, like, escape.
[225:05.07]Oh, I hit escape.
[225:06.97]How do I unescape?
[225:07.85]I didn't...
[225:08.49]Oh shit, the timer's gone.
[225:10.37]Oh no.
[225:11.41]I only have two skills because game is using the escape key both to progress and also to go back to change the skills out.
[225:24.96]I'm doing crits level two.
[225:26.84]I can't cancel the countdown.
[225:28.42]I'm just stuck here.
[225:32.32]Okay.
[225:32.62]I'm firearm.
[225:34.10]No.
[225:40.37]I don't know what to do.
[225:44.78]How about quick reload?
[225:45.90]That sounds good to me.
[225:46.52]Quick reload sounds good to me.
[225:49.70]Alright.
[225:52.36]I think I'm okay with this.
[225:53.40]I still have 8,000 points.
[225:59.27]Good.
[226:00.57]So now... One second.
[226:03.13]Okay.
[226:03.71]I think I'm good.
[226:14.66]The president spoke highly of you, Agent Kennedy.
[226:18.05]Which one's Agent Kennedy?
[226:18.95]Just kidding.
[226:20.41]Is it true you were the only ones present at the time of his death?
[226:28.78]What are you saying?
[226:30.10]How do you know a character is evil when they talk like...
[226:33.71]There's other characters that have talked like that in that tone that were good.
[226:37.97]Although I can see this actor leaning into the microphone with his hand up curling his fingers around while he says every line.
[226:59.37]He's, he's gripping the microphone.
[227:00.81]What'd you see?
[227:01.81]He has like glasses on down at his nose looking down at the script.
[227:04.75]His hand is up.
[227:06.33]Someone just said, dude, we can't even hear the game.
[227:10.22]We don't know what you're talking about.
[227:12.28]Is it really that low?
[227:25.48]The dialog's low, but the action's loud.
[227:29.04]It's not even specific to this game.
[227:31.62]That's like every video game and movie.
[227:34.72]Is it that hard to mix audio?
[227:36.93]Yeah, like sound effects mean gunshots and like footsteps.
[227:40.45]And when the gunshots literally blow out your eardrums and like everything else is too low.
[227:44.59]Yeah, I know what you mean.
[227:48.92]Like you can't watch a movie at home without having the remote in your hand the entire movie to just make micro adjustments up and down.
[227:57.48]Yeah.
[228:00.44]It's like you sit there and you just go like plus plus plus plus plus plus plus during dialog scenes and then when you know an explosion.
[228:06.59]It sucks because you've been in that position where like you're the quarterback of the living room.
[228:11.83]You're the caretaker of the experience.
[228:14.11]You have to anticipate the next explosion and go down down down down down.
[228:16.99]It sucks.
[228:18.77]And you have to get good at guessing what other people you may be watching with.
[228:21.99]If you're watching, like, a party or something.
[228:24.53]Yeah.
[228:25.11]Like, how comfortable is another person with the audio being loud or quiet, you know?
[228:30.79]Like, I have to gauge that.
[228:32.61]And it kind of, like, fucks up your viewing experience because you have to think two steps ahead of the movie.
[228:39.16]Oh, there you go.
[228:43.18]Well, with that lab of his sitting right on top of us, I'm going to go out on a limb and say yes.
[228:49.31]You getting all those things?
[228:51.07]Yeah, I'm getting some loot.
[228:53.80]Do you need help?
[228:56.18]How do you open?
[228:56.76]Oh, I got it.
[229:01.42]I think I actually have to help you do this or something.
[229:04.06]Can you, is it like a co-op moment?
[229:05.63]Because it's like I'm pushing.
[229:09.29]Can you like V next to it?
[229:12.95]Yo, you lied.
[229:13.59]He just lied, okay.
[229:22.77]Yeah.
[229:23.45]Oh, there's a snake in there.
[229:24.29]It was a jump scare.
[229:24.85]Kill that.
[229:25.13]It has a golden thing, right?
[229:28.53]That was actually pointless.
[229:29.81]Oh, wait.
[229:30.41]I thought that all the snakes in Resident Evil, if you kill them, they have... Like, money will drop and stuff.
[229:37.41]Annoying.
[229:42.30]Oh, the only thing scarier than zombies are skeletons.
[229:46.98]It's a cool Skyrim level.
[229:49.48]This does kind of look like a Skyrim dungeon, you're right.
[230:05.03]Look what you found.
[230:06.29]I walked right by this.
[230:07.33]Assault rifle.
[230:10.31]Nice.
[230:12.15]So, does every campaign reset your entire loadout to zero?
[230:15.89]I guess it does.
[230:17.35]It's two different characters each time.
[230:19.07]So, yeah.
[230:19.55]Probably.
[230:24.28]Watch out.
[230:24.66]You just stepped on the booby trap.
[230:27.82]Down.
[230:28.16]Put your head down.
[230:28.90]Watch it.
[230:29.52]Watch it.
[230:30.02]I think we have to slide on it.
[230:32.22]Crawl underneath it.
[230:39.62]There's a lot of people over there.
[230:42.22]Pull them back here.
[230:44.44]Don't even use bullets.
[230:45.16]Pull them back here.
[230:48.21]Just let them die.
[230:48.73]This is going to be so cinematic.
[230:53.41]In about 30 seconds when they get over here.
[230:58.67]Each campaign has different weapons.
[230:59.87]Oh, that's cool.
[231:01.05]One of them learns to crawl.
[231:04.33]Oh, I'm trying to help you.
[231:06.87]Well, that was dumb.
[231:09.83]I hate when zombies are smart in media, okay?
[231:12.70]Just make them dumb.
[231:14.20]They're more scary that way.
[231:16.24]Because if they have intelligence, then what if you're eliminating a new intelligent life form that you're simply too intimidated by?
[231:21.89]They already stand up.
[231:22.97]They already stand up and go back down.
[231:23.99]I think I can get it.
[231:28.47]I think I can probably get it.
[231:32.08]I'll tell you right now, this is very important.
[231:34.38]That's strike two.
[231:35.45]You got one more throw incendiary grenade at Jeremy when he's doing something.
[231:38.95]You got one more.
[231:41.07]That's strike three.
[231:45.29]Catch me if you can.
[231:52.08]Okay.
[231:53.70]I almost just walked into him.
[231:57.14]If there was a dropkick button, I could confirm would have dropkicked you into it.
[232:01.10]I may have done it.
[232:06.86]Why would you do... He was just... He likes fire.
[232:09.59]He's a pyro.
[232:10.21]We have to go over here.
[232:10.99]First person to run into the blades gets $10.
[232:14.27]What do I look like?
[232:14.97]Like a streamer?
[232:27.51]Uh, the deal is off.
[232:28.05]Shout me out for ten dollars.
[232:29.09]I think I have to boost you.
[232:38.18]So I... Good luck!
[232:41.08]Okay.
[232:41.58]I think I have to just sit down here.
[232:46.56]What is happening?
[232:48.94]Do I have to do some... Oh.
[232:51.65]Oh, it is a fast crawl.
[232:53.91]So I just have to defend, because they're just gonna be coming around the corner.
[233:02.24]I'm waiting.
[233:03.34]I'm crawling as fast as I can.
[233:05.32]Irma, don't go into the fire.
[233:07.20]You'll burn your Wellington.
[233:09.59]Thanks.
[233:10.37]That's a good idea.
[233:10.93]I probably shouldn't.
[233:17.05]Not the Wellington.
[233:18.21]I want that person to, like, know that I loved that one.
[233:22.38]That was awesome.
[233:24.72]Am I supposed to do this as fast as I can, or am I, like, helping you?
[233:27.12]There's probably...
[233:31.54]How do you get off of this?
[233:32.74]There we go.
[233:33.56]Probably have to aim it.
[233:35.88]I'm going to sneeze.
[233:37.81]Just want to let you know.
[233:38.99]I sneeze all the time.
[233:40.21]Do it.
[233:40.71]Your stream, not on mine.
[233:41.69]Do it.
[233:41.95]It was on your stream, not on mine.
[233:55.17]I'm sorry.
[233:56.13]I can't mute both.
[233:56.91]That wasn't even a sneeze.
[233:58.44]It was just like I accidentally startled you when you fell asleep during a movie or something.
[234:07.92]Now should we... That just changes the fire.
[234:12.84]Oh, but we can just... We have to do it.
[234:16.40]Maybe turn the fire back on, though.
[234:19.43]Okay, I'll tell you when to stop.
[234:21.03]There.
[234:21.39]Stop there.
[234:22.65]Stop?
[234:22.93]Actually... I don't know.
[234:25.02]Does it... I can do it as many times as I want.
[234:28.46]They're coming.
[234:28.90]They're coming.
[234:29.32]They're thinking about it.
[234:31.96]Here it comes.
[234:33.38]Good job.
[234:35.12]Toasted.
[234:36.06]Roasted.
[234:37.56]I'm going to wait.
[234:38.04]Okay, more.
[234:38.48]How are we doing?
[234:43.31]One's on fire.
[234:44.35]One fell down.
[234:45.45]Literally nothing tripped them.
[234:46.89]They just fell down.
[234:48.40]What happened to you?
[234:49.64]There's people coming out of crypts.
[234:51.98]Okay, there's people coming.
[234:53.38]Are you alright?
[234:53.98]Yeah, I'm good.
[234:57.46]Don't back up too far.
[234:58.46]I'll be good.
[235:00.56]Soon.
[235:01.94]Especially after I heal.
[235:05.74]There's a lot of people here.
[235:09.38]Oh, they have armor.
[235:15.49]Ow.
[235:16.36]Did that hit you somehow?
[235:17.50]Yeah.
[235:18.26]That was a finisher move, like... We have to collect all the shit on the bridge, man.
[235:22.69]Come on.
[235:25.09]Alright.
[235:25.53]Get on the thing.
[235:26.07]There's a bunch coming.
[235:26.63]I think you're closer.
[235:27.71]Well, now I'm closer.
[235:30.25]I was getting all the stuff on the bridge.
[235:31.67]Alright.
[235:32.09]I'm going to spin it.
[235:33.71]Uh-huh.
[235:34.73]Okay, you spin it, and I'll just stand next to you.
[235:37.91]Yeah, and take care of the people that fall down.
[235:40.79]I'm trying, but I'm running out of shotgun shells, and that's how I get my accuracy up.
[235:50.82]Survive the zombie attack.
[235:52.18]I don't even know if there's anybody else coming.
[236:01.31]We should probably take a look and make sure.
[236:03.21]Okay.
[236:04.42]You need to do a stream where you try to copy Gordon Ramsay's recipes.
[236:18.59]I don't think I want to do that.
[236:19.43]Delicious.
[236:20.47]I've made Gordon Ramsay's eggs before.
[236:23.22]In the pan.
[236:24.44]See ya.
[236:25.46]Delicious.
[236:27.84]Coriander.
[236:29.08]Two.
[236:30.18]Delicious.
[236:31.08]Two.
[236:32.06]Two corianders, please.
[236:33.34]Egg.
[236:34.12]Crack.
[236:35.38]Simmer.
[236:37.14]Delicious.
[236:38.20]It always says in by itself.
[236:41.48]Ooh, water.
[236:41.72]Water.
[236:48.61]Stewie Griffin.
[236:49.43]No, that was a Gordon Ramsay impression.
[236:52.21]That was not Stewie Griffin.
[236:52.91]I feel like there's something we can... Whatever.
[237:20.17]um okay just keep going that was the reveal for the boss later called foreshadowing that means the same thing Elena take the high road okay I'll just be doing the crawl animation again
[237:48.13]I probably have to get ready to attack.
[237:50.37]So I'm going to make sure I'm ready.
[237:52.21]There's someone in here.
[237:54.84]I'm ready for... I saw it.
[237:56.64]I just saw it.
[237:57.62]I saw it.
[237:58.78]It's coming closer.
[237:59.38]What is that?
[237:59.72]There's something coming closer.
[238:01.58]There's something here.
[238:02.10]Did I get it?
[238:04.74]Kind of on your own.
[238:07.57]I don't know.
[238:07.87]I don't know if I got it.
[238:14.09]I think I got it.
[238:19.48]That's kind of horrifying.
[238:20.08]There was one enemy in that entire tunnel.
[238:23.57]It was just one enemy.
[238:24.49]That's weird.
[238:25.05]Why?
[238:25.29]You blew up a fish.
[238:28.49]Oh, there's items.
[238:31.22]I don't have time for items.
[238:34.24]I'm opening the door right now.
[238:40.34]What happened?
[238:40.92]I have been grabbed and I'm being drowned and the fish is got both of us actually.
[238:49.53]Can you see this?
[238:50.29]Yeah.
[238:51.25]Okay.
[238:54.27]I don't know if that was a me cut scene or a both of us cut scene.
[238:57.53]It sounded like you hit the edge in operation.
[239:00.21]That was just an office camera angle of you.
[239:04.01]It was.
[239:05.13]It was the office.
[239:06.68]We've got problems.
[239:08.56]There's a lot going on.
[239:12.10]I'm in a corner.
[239:13.76]There's literally no way out.
[239:14.68]We're going to have to reload.
[239:15.54]What?
[239:16.42]There's zero way out.
[239:17.78]I can't even come to find you.
[239:19.44]Yeah, I know.
[239:21.81]That wasn't me.
[239:23.11]The game just spawned enemies on top of me after I did that.
[239:30.44]I hope we have a checkpoint right there.
[239:34.94]Oh, my God.
[239:35.90]Are you okay?
[239:37.96]No!
[239:38.60]This is the worst.
[239:39.80]Okay, so I have to snipe.
[239:41.32]That's what it wants me to do.
[239:42.88]Alright, I'm back.
[239:43.74]Keep moving forward.
[239:45.44]Keep moving forward.
[239:46.40]You got it.
[239:47.10]Alright, cover me.
[239:51.71]Run!
[239:52.71]I almost did.
[239:53.71]Oh, shit!
[240:01.81]Okay.
[240:05.41]Alright.
[240:07.21]I got you.
[240:11.28]Reloading.
[240:18.24]Did that not kill you?
[240:21.26]Shut up.
[240:22.24]Really?
[240:25.06]Your turn.
[240:25.96]It's my turn.
[240:26.54]Now you have to help me.
[240:29.81]You better snipe my side.
[240:31.15]I can't even see you.
[240:34.48]Snipe my side, please.
[240:36.08]I'm down here.
[240:36.98]Alright, you seem fine.
[240:42.84]I think I am.
[240:43.32]Can you get through now?
[240:44.17]Yeah, I'm good.
[240:47.67]There's like... Be careful.
[240:50.59]Stand up on the other side.
[240:53.07]I'm sorry.
[240:53.59]I'm freaking out for no reason.
[240:54.75]Jesus, Jeremy.
[240:55.70]Just relax.
[240:57.18]How are you supposed to get through this?
[240:59.20]Why won't I stay on the ground?
[241:00.98]Do you turn this off?
[241:06.25]I think we have to just get through both of our gauntlets.
[241:11.41]I don't think I can turn yours off.
[241:12.55]There's another step jump scared me.
[241:15.34]The snake ran into the booby trap.
[241:18.98]Okay.
[241:19.54]Now just go forward.
[241:20.70]Oh, it's because I have the sniper rifle out.
[241:26.97]Okay, I'm just warning you.
[241:28.09]There's a non zero chance of me insta dying over here.
[241:33.67]I would say the same thing over here too.
[241:37.55]This is incredibly fast.
[241:41.89]And that's definitely the way I'm supposed to go.
[241:49.81]Um.
[241:53.32]Oh, there's a guy.
[241:54.20]There's a guy doing it.
[241:55.58]I stopped.
[241:55.92]Did I stop yours?
[241:56.76]Okay, nice.
[242:01.10]Now I can do yours, I think?
[242:03.46]Find the crank.
[242:04.18]What do you mean it's not even in here?
[242:08.10]You think the developers forgot?
[242:14.46]This guy... We have to find a crank.
[242:18.84]Did you find it?
[242:22.91]What did you just do?
[242:24.23]Why did you do that?
[242:28.53]There was no reason for you to turn it on.
[242:30.27]Yeah, there was.
[242:31.81]This is the only time in the entire game that we've played up to this point where a crank didn't do something beneficial.
[242:39.23]I didn't know that was the crank you killed the guy that was turning because I just turned a crank over here that opened the door.
[242:44.39]Why would I think that the next crank that looks identical to that would pierce you with sharp objects?
[242:51.33]Wait till I get across from this.
[242:53.13]I didn't know what it was.
[242:54.79]Listen, in this game up till now, you see a lever, you pull it, and something good happens.
[242:59.08]Okay?
[242:59.36]I got baited by the devs.
[243:01.22]Okay.
[243:02.04]I don't think I can do anything until you turn this.
[243:07.40]No, that's not strike three.
[243:08.22]That was not an incendiary grenade.
[243:11.34]Close, though.
[243:11.90]Almost.
[243:12.64]He's close.
[243:15.18]That was a foul tip.
[243:16.98]No, that means you caught it.
[243:22.72]Okay, what do I do now?
[243:24.95]The game tells you to pull this.
[243:37.17]Why did I put that down?
[243:38.71]Oh my god.
[243:41.07]Reunite with your partner.
[243:44.23]I'd love to.
[243:46.28]Why does this not work?
[243:50.76]Okay.
[243:51.36]Oh, shit.
[243:52.10]He dropped something.
[243:53.72]There's a key over here or something.
[244:00.80]I shot that guy in the face three times.
[244:02.43]Oh, man.
[244:06.75]Oh, man.
[244:07.41]Oh, man.
[244:08.01]Oh, man.
[244:08.61]Oh, man.
[244:09.31]Oh, man.
[244:09.89]Oh, man.
[244:18.29]Alright, uh, I'm still just kind of chilling over here.
[244:21.95]With the lever that kills you.
[244:23.85]Why the fuck can't I hurt these guys?
[244:33.74]Can you pull a lever on your side over there?
[244:35.50]There's a lever over here I need to get, but it... Go pull that one.
[244:39.50]But it's protected by these stupid spitting guys that just won't stop and I can't hit them with anything.
[244:45.05]The lever's behind you.
[244:46.09]No, there's a key on the ground over here.
[244:49.62]Oh my fucking god.
[244:51.14]What?
[244:52.22]I'm gonna scream at this game.
[244:54.08]If you die before I get over there.
[244:57.22]Why can I not hit this guy?
[244:59.28]Because they're waiting for me.
[245:01.51]I shot that guy this night.
[245:02.37]What do you have?
[245:02.87]He had a clay helmet on.
[245:04.27]Oh, I've got a clay helmet on.
[245:05.61]I'm immune to all damage.
[245:07.09]That's just basic Minecraft progression.
[245:10.23]Alright, I need to get that.
[245:16.31]Am I really going to sit here and watch you through the sniper as you slowly crawl under the blades?
[245:21.57]When I am mere steps away from being on the same exact level as you.
[245:26.34]You don't understand.
[245:27.04]We're both going to have to go that way anyway.
[245:29.16]I have to get the crank.
[245:30.46]You're going to go get the key.
[245:31.58]I got the crank.
[245:32.61]I got it.
[245:33.21]Are you okay?
[245:40.29]Why did that happen?
[245:43.37]Okay, I am ready to turn the crank.
[245:47.97]Here we go.
[245:55.99]Thank you.
[245:56.59]There's nobody coming after me, right?
[245:58.33]I hear screaming, but I don't see anybody.
[246:00.20]Alright, I am through.
[246:03.50]It's because he was below your line of sight.
[246:11.07]Alright.
[246:11.33]Is this crank going to murder you?
[246:13.19]I hope not.
[246:13.83]I think it's going to open this.
[246:21.04]Ow.
[246:23.86]Oh, shit.
[246:25.14]How did that?
[246:25.72]There's no.
[246:26.32]Okay.
[246:26.54]That was a movie action movie.
[246:29.25]How did the bad guy hit only the small, thin piece of metal with the ricochet, but not the person that they were aiming at?
[246:37.09]And now I'm not going to criticize that in a movie ever again.
[246:40.62]If Resident Evil 6 is so bad, why are you playing it?
[246:42.96]I think it's fun.
[246:46.08]Hey, if this stream is so bad, why are you watching it?
[246:48.40]No, don't say that.
[246:49.38]Looks like we're finally making it out of here.
[246:52.93]I think I'm having a good time.
[246:54.17]This is really fun.
[246:54.81]Oh, yeah.
[246:55.25]This is actually a pretty fun game.
[246:56.99]I'm not messing around.
[246:59.25]I really do think this is fun.
[247:00.69]Why can we not do this?
[247:03.05]I was on yours.
[247:03.61]Oh, well, sorry.
[247:06.86]Get the levers confused.
[247:18.27]Somber music.
[247:19.19]If you're having fun playing, explain the plot then.
[247:21.61]It's a Resident Evil game.
[247:25.05]Yeah, but I've played all the Dark Souls games.
[247:27.23]I have no idea what's going on in the Dark Souls games either.
[247:31.05]Or Kingdom Hearts.
[247:32.03]I still played those.
[247:32.67]Alright, you can't jump off the edge.
[247:44.31]I was testing.
[247:44.73]You played Kingdom Hearts?
[247:45.79]Back up.
[247:47.90]You didn't play Kingdom Hearts?
[247:49.34]I mean, yeah.
[247:51.36]I played Kingdom Hearts so I could watch.
[247:54.28]When you walk away.
[247:56.27]Like six times in a row.
[247:57.73]And then that's pretty much the only reason.
[247:59.05]I started a new game so I could watch the music video.
[248:02.17]There was more after that?
[248:03.17]Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 were good.
[248:04.09]There you go.
[248:13.76]No, I wanted to do that.
[248:19.45]Okay, so how much time is left in this campaign, the Leon campaign?
[248:24.30]Okay, is it just me?
[248:25.52]It feels like, listen, we're having so much fun, but I feel like we've been playing for seven hours, but we've only been playing for, like, three and a half.
[248:31.90]Just, well, no longer than that.
[248:33.76]Well, I mean, like, the stream's been on for, like, four hours, but... Oh, okay, we've... I don't...
[248:47.47]I was gonna do a cool snipe, and I came out of the cutscene, and they're going to kill me.
[248:52.60]They're not.
[248:55.88]You just like playing Kingdom Hearts because when Goofy goes, and that's true.
[249:06.05]When he does what?
[249:07.25]When he says,
[249:21.98]I would kill to watch you play Gears of War co-op.
[249:24.16]I don't think that would have the same charm.
[249:28.17]I don't want to play Gears of War.
[249:30.55]The game, it's cool.
[249:31.45]I played it a lot a long time ago.
[249:35.03]But no, I don't really think so.
[249:37.83]That would be like... It would be so boring in comparison.
[249:44.31]That really is just to take cover and shoot.
[249:46.69]There's nothing else going on.
[249:48.26]Especially the first two of them.
[249:51.02]Maybe they changed the formula in the last ones, but... I need help.
[249:55.98]It's like... Okay.
[250:00.89]It doesn't have quite the same level of goofy cutscenes.
[250:08.59]Aye, aye, aye.
[250:10.41]Uh-huh.
[250:12.57]Are we supposed to just go?
[250:13.39]I hate the guys that have the armor.
[250:15.46]It's not fair.
[250:17.90]The RTS is very good though.
[250:19.20]I did play that.
[250:20.18]The Gears of War XCOM game was actually good.
[250:24.78]Was it?
[250:25.64]Yeah.
[250:26.58]Surprisingly.
[250:28.74]Gears 1 and 2 rule.
[250:31.22]I don't even remember which one I played.
[250:33.80]Because I definitely only played one of them.
[250:35.54]I did not play Gears of War.
[250:38.34]I don't remember.
[250:38.78]I feel like it was 3.
[250:41.46]They're pretty similar.
[250:53.99]Is he still not dead?
[250:54.65]I don't know how he's alive.
[250:57.47]I just got inspired to make a beef Wellington this Christmas.
[251:01.17]Did you?
[251:01.43]I thought you were saying that.
[251:07.90]I got really inspired here.
[251:08.96]I guess I know where I'm going to be.
[251:14.62]Oops.
[251:15.65]Oops.
[251:16.79]Yep.
[251:17.21]It would be a shame if I didn't click V there.
[251:22.72]I don't want to make a Beef Wellington because Beef Wellington, to me, just looks like a weird corn dog, hot dog, raw meat thing.
[251:27.98]I don't want it.
[251:28.40]It's just like a gigantic corn dog, but it's raw in the middle.
[251:34.32]Watch out.
[251:34.64]He's blending in.
[251:46.66]I got... I got your back.
[251:48.64]Okay.
[251:49.62]Don't know what exploded.
[251:50.74]Can we knock the... I guess this is a cutscene.
[251:54.31]We can't do it.
[251:56.83]What is he doing?
[251:58.47]You got this?
[252:01.24]Maybe?
[252:01.86]I don't know.
[252:04.42]Nope.
[252:06.57]He turned like 90.
[252:08.07]I may have planted a bomb.
[252:09.51]Just wait till we can move away.
[252:12.39]Please.
[252:13.05]He's going to kill you.
[252:14.16]He's going to hit you right now.
[252:15.34]I knew it was going to happen.
[252:17.00]I knew it was going to happen.
[252:18.46]Alright, I'm in it.
[252:20.10]We were supposed to shoot the bridge.
[252:21.54]He killed me.
[252:23.58]I didn't.
[252:27.72]We were supposed to shoot the bridge.
[252:29.57]Have you ever had a beef Wellington before?
[252:31.45]No.
[252:32.88]Okay, I know everyone here is like... I, like everyone else, eat vicariously through Gordon Ramsay videos.
[252:36.97]Yeah, but people just kept saying that's a shit take, worst take.
[252:39.83]Has anyone in this chat eaten a beef Wellington before?
[252:43.21]I feel like it's like three of you.
[252:44.27]I don't think anyone's even had this before.
[252:49.01]Listen, if there's not macaroni and cheese in it, they probably haven't tasted it.
[252:51.85]I mean, macaroni and cheese is based, so... Alright, let's get him to run.
[252:59.94]Hurry because other guys so now we've when he's on the bridge week.
[253:03.51]That was a guy.
[253:04.07]It wasn't me It was a guy to the bridge shoot the bridge to the bridge Shoot the bridge Let's just run across the bridge run across the bridge I'm going as fast as I can here comes wait.
[253:20.92]Oh god Fuck
[253:25.37]Okay.
[253:26.33]How long do you have?
[253:27.09]Give me a timer.
[253:28.02]I have a little bit.
[253:28.60]I've got like at least 5 to 10 seconds.
[253:32.32]He'll kill me if he gets another.
[253:35.18]Go across the bridge.
[253:35.82]Can you get across?
[253:36.70]We're surrounded.
[253:39.74]Just keep going this way.
[253:41.84]There's nothing over here.
[253:44.45]This way.
[253:49.71]He's coming.
[253:50.09]He's coming.
[253:50.45]He's coming.
[253:51.35]Alright.
[253:55.16]Another bridge.
[253:56.24]Can we get him?
[253:57.14]Another bridge.
[253:57.60]He's still on the bridge.
[253:59.12]There's two.
[253:59.54]What do you mean there's two?
[254:03.52]Why is there two?
[254:04.40]This is unfair.
[254:05.66]What?
[254:06.00]We're sandwiched in.
[254:08.27]Oh, my God.
[254:09.11]We're not going to be able to do this?
[254:12.91]It did like a cut scene.
[254:13.99]I could have revived you.
[254:16.09]This is bullshit because look at how much weight is currently on this thing and it didn't fall.
[254:20.01]Are you serious?
[254:21.59]Listen, Umbrella uses only the best structural engineers.
[254:29.02]Okay.
[254:29.14]How do you think they made such a successful mutating campaign?
[254:32.34]They had to start with... Let's not shoot the bridge.
[254:34.90]That didn't do anything.
[254:37.36]Okay, why don't we just kill... I got an idea.
[254:38.87]Just both of us plant a bomb.
[254:41.03]I'll just plant a bomb right here.
[254:42.85]Okay, we'll just plant one there.
[254:45.19]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[254:46.73]He's coming, so I'm going to run.
[254:49.51]Oh, no.
[254:50.53]I'm going to put my... What the?
[254:53.53]It won't let me run.
[254:55.97]Don't blow yours up yet.
[254:58.29]Three, two, one, blow it up.
[255:01.01]Wow.
[255:03.31]Alright, we got him.
[255:11.20]I'm wasting so much ammo like an idiot.
[255:14.42]Okay.
[255:15.24]We need to do that again.
[255:16.70]Yep.
[255:17.12]But that one's... That guy's dead.
[255:22.36]I got incendiary grenades.
[255:23.22]I'm just gonna throw it.
[255:23.80]Alright.
[255:32.54]He's not coming this way.
[255:33.52]Oh god.
[255:33.88]Watch out.
[255:38.58]Thank you.
[255:39.92]Anytime.
[255:40.36]Okay, get some ammo.
[255:45.21]Is it this bridge?
[255:46.07]I think it's the next one.
[255:47.53]The one that goes up.
[255:49.75]Wait, do we go down this bridge?
[255:52.33]Yeah, it's the other way.
[255:53.99]Yeah, it's the one that goes up.
[256:02.16]It's easy to get turned around in this particular area.
[256:06.30]Hold on.
[256:06.64]Are we stupid here?
[256:09.56]No, this is the right way.
[256:11.50]But I think since we died, they took one of the big boys away to make it easy.
[256:14.76]No, maybe he's here.
[256:15.66]Here he is.
[256:16.02]I think he's here, yeah.
[256:16.71]There's a guy behind us.
[256:18.89]Careful.
[256:19.15]Okay.
[256:21.63]I'll go.
[256:22.15]You wait.
[256:22.61]I'll go get him.
[256:23.85]Don't go too... Okay, I hit him with that.
[256:26.21]Did you throw that?
[256:26.81]I did.
[256:27.75]That guy has a bunch of fucking bombs all over him.
[256:29.73]Did it work?
[256:35.52]Yeah, it kind of did.
[256:38.64]That should be good.
[256:44.60]Oh, my God.
[256:45.32]Die already.
[256:45.94]He's dead.
[256:54.14]Okay.
[256:55.10]Not bad.
[256:57.95]Watch there be a third one.
[257:02.50]I'm going to get a grenade out because I feel like there's going to be a third one.
[257:07.77]We get a checkpoint, though.
[257:08.47]That's good.
[257:08.73]I don't see another one.
[257:15.07]Devs, can I get some new content?
[257:16.55]I need something to react to.
[257:20.41]I hear somebody.
[257:22.13]I can't.
[257:22.51]I honestly can't.
[257:23.25]The guy just spit in my eyes and turned me into Rayman.
[257:25.21]Okay.
[257:25.90]What's going on?
[257:26.68]He spit in my eyes and turned me into Rayman.
[257:28.44]Just get over here.
[257:28.92]I'm stuck in the animation.
[257:30.44]What?
[257:31.50]He spit on you at the exact moment I confirmed the co-op moment, so I'm just over here.
[257:37.18]Oh, no.
[257:38.12]I'm in the, like, running crouch animation ready to cross.
[257:42.86]You good?
[257:43.28]Thank you.
[257:43.70]You snapped me out.
[257:44.30]Yeah, yeah.
[257:51.67]Nice.
[257:53.23]Not nice.
[257:55.07]I saw this scene in Resident Evil 5.
[257:57.17]Is this the part where I punch the rock while you... I think you have to lower the bridge.
[258:03.98]Do you see any of these people over here that are crawling up behind me?
[258:06.60]I got you.
[258:07.64]I got you.
[258:07.96]I got you.
[258:08.24]I'm not even kidding.
[258:08.86]I seriously do.
[258:09.90]Okay.
[258:10.20]There's four of them, though.
[258:11.20]Keep crawling.
[258:11.58]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[258:14.03]I'm crawling as... Okay.
[258:15.75]I actually just saved your life.
[258:17.19]I just... That...
[258:19.47]Trust me when I say that you actually would have died if I did not do that.
[258:23.29]I mean, I have full health, but sure.
[258:24.47]There were four of them grabbing you.
[258:27.65]I thought you just jumped off the edge.
[258:28.53]I feel like I need this.
[258:39.06]Oh boy, watch out.
[258:42.26]I got big problems.
[258:44.64]I can just snipe.
[258:45.14]I'm going to shoot the big guy.
[258:46.84]Just worry about the other guys.
[258:49.57]Big guy's going down.
[258:56.16]Big guy is still alive.
[258:58.98]He's taking a lot of damage though.
[259:00.96]Alright, big guy dead.
[259:12.71]Okay, cool.
[259:14.77]Looks pretty good.
[259:15.43]I want all that stuff too though.
[259:17.47]Oh, there's some juicy skill points.
[259:25.58]I think somebody's behind me.
[259:26.36]No?
[259:29.42]Where are you?
[259:31.18]You have to put the bridge down here.
[259:39.68]I am currently sniping.
[259:41.68]There's people coming over.
[259:42.82]Are you away?
[259:43.38]Um, what the fuck was that?
[259:46.95]That guy had dynamite, I think.
[259:48.53]What guy had, who had dynamite?
[259:51.95]I don't know.
[259:52.37]They're just strapped with dynamite for some reason.
[259:54.95]But why did it blow up near me?
[259:56.87]That was, I don't understand that.
[260:07.38]Are we going to get an auto check?
[260:09.38]He's doing alright.
[260:11.60]He's in the other room.
[260:13.58]This is extremely slow.
[260:15.80]There's nobody coming after you yet.
[260:18.98]Not that I can see.
[260:21.50]Oh, they are.
[260:24.60]Now they're on your side.
[260:26.89]I got like 85%.
[260:27.51]You got a guy right behind you.
[260:31.51]95%.
[260:31.73]It's over.
[260:33.49]Okay, now don't be mad at me for running down the whole bridge because I want to get all that stuff.
[260:40.34]He's still alive.
[260:44.46]Oh, I need bullets.
[260:45.14]That was actually really cool.
[260:52.59]Let me go get this.
[260:53.59]I can't go get this stuff.
[260:54.63]That's so unfair.
[260:55.51]What?
[260:57.71]I can't get it?
[260:59.45]I don't think you do.
[261:00.08]Let's push it.
[261:11.26]Irma lost auto in his huge mansion.
[261:17.33]Right behind you.
[261:17.87]He didn't make it.
[261:24.97]That was very scary.
[261:26.43]Did you shoot that guy?
[261:27.69]No, he fell.
[261:32.29]Hold on.
[261:32.59]I need to do this.
[261:35.40]I mean, it took both Leon and Helena to push a rock, whereas Chris pushed it by itself.
[261:40.46]So I guess he's at least as strong as both of us combined.
[261:44.64]Chris Redfield.
[261:47.30]Yeah, that's the fifth character in this game.
[261:50.44]I wouldn't be surprised.
[261:51.14]I think he has a whole campaign.
[261:53.53]Help me.
[261:54.51]I don't know what I did.
[261:59.29]Can you tell the people behind me to wait?
[262:02.77]Oh, boy.
[262:06.39]Alright, watch out behind us.
[262:08.57]Hey, manage your inventory real quick and then heal.
[262:11.92]I got it.
[262:12.26]Thank you.
[262:13.42]Your name was red.
[262:14.02]It was bothering me.
[262:18.06]Oh, on the wrong side.
[262:18.86]Okay.
[262:24.59]There's noises.
[262:26.93]Yeah, there are noises.
[262:28.35]Use progress bar.
[262:30.41]I would say we should probably stop right now.
[262:32.97]Stop.
[262:34.97]And fight?
[262:35.96]How do we get off?
[262:38.90]We're just one person.
[262:39.92]Oh, come on.
[262:40.56]It falls all the way back.
[262:45.26]Was that like a developer meme?
[262:48.63]I think that was just like a gotcha moment.
[262:50.75]It was like, oh, you thought you were going to have to do the entire bridge?
[262:54.96]Or we fucked it somehow.
[262:57.47]And we fucked it up somehow.
[262:59.49]We gotta go fast.
[263:02.63]I think we fucked it up.
[263:04.41]Oh shit.
[263:04.99]Are you okay?
[263:06.33]Yeah.
[263:06.55]Are you?
[263:07.05]I think so.
[263:07.97]Thanks for your concern.
[263:09.77]Big boy.
[263:10.75]You gotta go.
[263:15.93]B?
[263:16.33]That was a Sonic losing all the rings moment.
[263:24.16]You good?
[263:25.03]Yep.
[263:29.79]Okay, you somehow landed... There's way too... There's too many.
[263:36.10]Okay.
[263:36.28]There's too much going on.
[263:37.24]Alright.
[263:38.46]Are you good?
[263:42.26]I think so.
[263:44.20]Jesus.
[263:44.66]Are you alright?
[263:45.80]Yeah, there's just ground shaking.
[263:47.94]We keep just going.
[263:48.68]You good?
[263:49.22]Are you okay?
[263:50.63]Oh, are you okay, man?
[263:51.31]You good?
[263:52.09]Everything okay?
[263:54.25]You good?
[263:55.59]Oh, someone put another two-person boulder here.
[264:00.95]Those are the Indiana Jones, the ones who got squashed.
[264:06.28]We made it.
[264:08.32]Did you ever think about how difficult it would be to reset the traps in those temples?
[264:12.22]They give you just one guy in to trigger all of them.
[264:14.46]Well, they only have to happen once.
[264:21.14]if you're good enough to get into the temple then you're like the earnest level threat yeah but what I'm saying is like what if you get what if you're like 80 of the way through but the last one gets you like they have someone has to go in and reset all the other traps before the next guy comes in are we supposed to I know is this a screensaver like what's happening it's just a cut scene stop trying to make that a thing no I'm gonna continue to try to make that a thing what what thing
[264:52.09]Alright, so we have to swim.
[264:55.33]Ernest's Christmas Special?
[264:59.30]All the Ernest movies are required reading.
[265:02.42]Yeah, they're pretty good.
[265:03.12]There's a space bar thing here.
[265:04.90]Yeah, it says perform stroke.
[265:09.48]Oh, there's like an air pocket.
[265:10.88]Wait, there's an air pocket?
[265:12.82]Yeah, you swam past it.
[265:13.84]I pressed space bar, so I got a breath.
[265:15.44]Well, hopefully I find an air pocket up here.
[265:19.41]Found an air pocket.
[265:20.07]Good.
[265:29.21]Alright, which would you rather do?
[265:31.31]This whole section again, or I give you an Ocarina of Time water temple save, and you have to start there.
[265:37.88]I'd rather do this a thousand more times.
[265:39.54]80 meters.
[265:50.88]Alright, where's the air pocket?
[265:54.33]I don't know.
[265:55.05]Which way did you go?
[265:56.51]I'm behind you, I think.
[265:59.08]I've still got half air.
[266:00.24]Yeah, I have a lot of air too.
[266:02.38]He's fucking stroking me.
[266:03.52]What the fuck?
[266:06.30]Well, I don't have a lot of air now.
[266:08.00]That's great.
[266:10.12]Oh, there's one right here.
[266:12.50]Can we share?
[266:14.35]See if we can share.
[266:15.29]Do you pop up?
[266:18.75]There's a lot of blood and guts in here for some reason.
[266:24.05]That is a lot.
[266:26.71]Like Halloween decorations.
[266:28.91]Even the underwater segments have to look spooky.
[266:32.13]Okay, I'm getting choked now too.
[266:36.81]I'm doing a great job holding my breath in spite of it though.
[266:39.43]Okay, it's just getting me again.
[266:44.83]I'm going to die.
[266:45.89]What?
[266:46.81]No, I just won't let... Are you okay?
[266:48.85]I'm trying to get away.
[266:49.51]Yeah, I got 40% here.
[266:51.63]I'm trying to like... Where do you go?
[266:53.52]I'm going back to the airplane.
[266:57.16]Yeah, man.
[266:58.06]I'm just fucking going.
[266:59.90]I'm literally just going to go to the end.
[267:01.54]Because it's right here.
[267:05.44]I hope you lure grab me over there.
[267:10.35]Fucking god, dude.
[267:14.15]I hope I can cut seeing you over here.
[267:16.55]This is going to be bad in a second, I think.
[267:18.11]I need you over here.
[267:26.11]I'm working my way over.
[267:27.51]I'm gonna drown.
[267:28.51]Is there an air pocket anywhere right here?
[267:29.67]I'm almost there.
[267:31.90]Are you here?
[267:32.94]Yep.
[267:34.70]What am I- What do I need to be looking at?
[267:36.00]What are you looking at?
[267:36.78]What the fuck is this mouse bullshit?
[267:38.56]I'm up to the ceiling.
[267:39.22]Quick, quick, quick.
[267:39.62]I hit V, V, V. Up the ceiling.
[267:40.62]V at the ceiling.
[267:41.08]Quick.
[267:42.22]V at the ceiling.
[267:42.80]V at the ceiling.
[267:43.26]I'm gonna die.
[267:43.95]I'm dead in 10 seconds.
[267:45.93]Oh, thank God.
[267:46.55]I think we're good.
[267:47.09]At least now we don't have to swim up.
[267:52.49]Okay.
[267:55.05]I hope your earpiece is still working.
[267:56.48]Okay.
[267:59.15]Here comes the boss I think.
[268:02.01]All the way down.
[268:02.45]You just have to survive.
[268:19.61]Where are you?
[268:20.71]Are you in the mouth?
[268:21.89]I thought I was in his ass.
[268:23.77]You're on the tail.
[268:24.83]I'm getting bit.
[268:26.73]I thought I was up his ass.
[268:35.42]I don't know why I thought that.
[268:38.72]Okay, let's go.
[268:39.82]It's space and R, the two dumbest combinations.
[268:47.44]I kind of...
[268:55.04]I actually just wanted to see what would happen.
[268:58.49]It's incredible that my human strength is capable of stopping that.
[269:03.65]Okay, here we go.
[269:04.79]Space and R. I'm ready.
[269:10.27]Space plus R, you fell off.
[269:12.45]Fine.
[269:23.38]Okay.
[269:24.78]I got it.
[269:30.48]Mine's just mash keys.
[269:32.26]Alright.
[269:36.21]I got space plus R ready.
[269:37.33]There's a shiny bit in the middle.
[269:40.77]Alright.
[269:41.11]I got it.
[269:41.39]It's like a...
[269:53.09]Are we holding our breath this long?
[269:55.29]Don't worry about that.
[269:56.53]Just stab the weak spot.
[269:59.31]Together, probably.
[270:00.11]Probably both of us using a spear at the same time.
[270:03.04]I think so.
[270:03.78]Are you okay?
[270:04.86]I'm good.
[270:06.20]I just bam.
[270:09.42]I'm up in the mouth.
[270:12.30]Are you at the stomach?
[270:14.73]I don't know.
[270:15.19]I think I was just waiting for you.
[270:17.71]I was in there, hanging out.
[270:20.21]Oh, now you got the office camera now.
[270:23.97]Uh, you're in the water with it.
[270:26.87]Okay.
[270:27.17]Find a place to climb up?
[270:30.63]Okay, where?
[270:34.38]Here?
[270:34.66]Uh, there's a tunnel that you can swim through.
[270:42.28]That's over towards me.
[270:45.78]I think they just want you to go through the tunnel.
[270:47.68]Oh.
[270:49.00]And then I...
[270:51.26]We'll get jump scared.
[270:55.31]I said I find a thing to climb up.
[270:57.15]I didn't know like go through the tunnel and around the whole level.
[270:59.65]I'm looking for like a little ladder on the edge.
[271:01.85]Oh, you thought this was over?
[271:03.19]We're only like a third of the way through this level.
[271:05.01]I think you have to open this.
[271:12.12]Helena, can you do something about these bars?
[271:14.54]I'm working on it.
[271:15.14]Leave me alone.
[271:15.60]I can try.
[271:16.54]Hold on.
[271:17.78]What if I just left you?
[271:20.73]You would die.
[271:21.84]Oh, I see.
[271:22.84]This is testing past mechanics.
[271:27.49]Thank you.
[271:30.47]I tried.
[271:31.81]Looks like I can get up over there, but the fish is probably going to jump up.
[271:35.81]I got to be ready.
[271:38.21]There it is.
[271:39.86]Did I make it?
[271:48.50]Are you alive?
[271:49.12]Yes.
[271:49.92]You're welcome.
[271:54.42]I'm telling you, Mario boss.
[272:02.18]Okay, one more time.
[272:03.54]We're going to jump on its head one more time.
[272:06.28]Okay.
[272:12.04]You're in a weird spot.
[272:16.89]And what am I supposed to do about this?
[272:19.33]I didn't do anything.
[272:20.63]Yeah, I shot it.
[272:22.31]I'm on the bridge.
[272:24.06]I'm on the bridge above you watching.
[272:25.24]You start swimming.
[272:26.58]It's giving me all these prompts and then take it away from me.
[272:32.16]Okay.
[272:34.69]Very nice.
[272:35.09]Time to actually fight the fish, right?
[272:38.57]I imagine that's what's happening here.
[272:40.81]Hello?
[272:42.35]How are you?
[272:43.47]I made it.
[272:46.45]And I am ready to not crawl through this, but rather use our combined strength to push it.
[272:58.18]Okay.
[273:00.80]Defeat the BOW.
[273:04.51]Why is it slow?
[273:06.97]Wait, feed it barrels.
[273:09.23]It's got this explosive barrels.
[273:14.62]The edges of the screen.
[273:17.72]I feel like we're going into hyperspace.
[273:19.28]I can't even look at this.
[273:24.96]This is a warp gate.
[273:27.50]Yeah, this sucks.
[273:31.27]We're good.
[273:40.47]Wait for a barrel.
[273:42.88]Oh, barrel.
[273:44.54]Yep.
[273:45.28]Right now?
[273:46.00]I'm reloading.
[273:46.58]I think we're good.
[273:49.60]I think we're okay.
[273:55.51]Did we just beat it?
[273:56.19]That's what it's like to get stuck in the water park.
[274:00.09]I feel like we weren't supposed to win that fast.
[274:06.13]Nice bit rate, yeah.
[274:07.31]Bit rate is dead.
[274:08.09]Yeah, I'm in the same... We were sliding down that for like 45... How did we get outside?
[274:21.22]We were falling through a very long tunnel.
[274:23.02]We would be like a thousand meters underground.
[274:25.89]There's a nuke that just went off.
[274:31.01]So they're destroying the place.
[274:38.29]He's sterilizing the area.
[274:40.15]You do an impression of Daniel Day Lewis in Where There Will Be Blood.
[274:44.14]Sure.
[274:45.20]I actually haven't seen that movie.
[274:50.72]Alright, that's a good one for when they're attacking Leon.
[274:57.97]Can we get another one with a little bit more energy?
[275:00.79]I think that's pretty accurate.
[275:02.11]Somebody said that was a bad impression because I hate that movie.
[275:05.19]That's not how it works.
[275:15.66]You're farming nominations for the end of the year.
[275:17.84]So many bioterrorism attacks.
[275:27.51]We just can't contain them all.
[275:38.03]It's nothing we can do.
[275:38.97]Umbrella is rated A plus by the Better Business Bureau.
[275:42.49]Out of our hands.
[275:44.23]We have no evidence.
[275:46.05]And right now, you two are on the top of their list of suspects.
[275:48.73]That sounded like a Pokémon.
[275:54.67]What Pokémon sounds like that?
[275:57.66]No, it didn't.
[275:58.34]What Pokémon are you talking about?
[275:59.66]Can you do that?
[276:03.42]What?
[276:04.94]Of course.
[276:06.34]But they'll figure it out eventually.
[276:10.22]What are you going to do?
[276:15.48]Is this the end of his chapter?
[276:17.69]We may have just beat this.
[276:20.47]Yeah.
[276:28.59]Oh, look at all these accolades.
[276:32.13]S rank.
[276:34.05]I got gold, though you got silver.
[276:36.60]This is platinum.
[276:37.28]Mine has a crown.
[276:38.28]My metal has a royal crown on it and a wreath.
[276:41.78]Your wreath is wilting.
[276:44.12]Mine is flexing.
[276:46.54]You're getting outgamed.
[276:54.52]Oh, shit.
[276:55.05]Okay.
[276:59.87]Okay, I can actually put a third skill in now.
[277:03.26]We have 30,000 bucks.
[277:04.06]I want to know how bad that was.
[277:06.52]I'm going to watch the VOD later and say how bad it was.
[277:12.16]I can't buy anything.
[277:16.60]How?
[277:17.02]I had 8,000 left over from last time, bud.
[277:19.81]Well, because you got kicked out, remember?
[277:21.57]You hit like escape.
[277:24.01]So you should have a lot of money right now, shouldn't you?
[277:25.71]I got 30k.
[277:26.59]You should have like 20k at least.
[277:27.45]No, 13k.
[277:33.34]There's a lot of single player only ones.
[277:38.24]Speeds up recovery time when dying.
[277:40.32]What does that even mean?
[277:40.92]Maybe you'll do firearm.
[277:44.37]What's combat gauge?
[277:45.91]Is that a mechanic we should know?
[277:48.89]Item drop thing.
[277:49.85]I don't know.
[277:50.91]Not into.
[277:51.31]Oops.
[278:02.10]I'm good.
[278:10.23]I got 28,000 more points.
[278:12.93]I'm dropping items.
[278:14.47]How many chapters are left?
[278:16.47]I would assume it's probably five or two.
[278:20.92]In Leon's campaign or in the whole game?
[278:22.94]In this campaign.
[278:24.06]Oh, I don't know.
[278:25.04]There are two more for Leon's story.
[278:28.52]Okay.
[278:32.87]I thought the Daniel Day Lewis impression was good, but I have not seen the movie.
[278:36.07]I've only seen one clip.
[278:37.59]That's what my impression was based off of.
[278:42.90]Where's the thing I unlocked?
[278:47.06]What is happening?
[278:51.12]What's wrong?
[278:52.62]I'm trying to like.
[278:58.27]There we go.
[278:58.53]Alright.
[279:01.23]The UI is the problem.
[279:03.92]Everything okay?
[279:05.10]The item drop skills, probably why you have so much more.
[279:08.35]We got some item drop skill users.
[279:13.69]Oh, I had item drop on.
[279:15.83]Oh, no, because you got to run that whole section.
[279:19.17]Yeah, I did get like a big bridge with a lot of stuff.
[279:24.02]You can hit escape anytime, by the way.
[279:26.06]Oh, I thought, I didn't know.
[279:39.91]This plane is dead.
[279:41.41]It's already dead.
[279:45.61]On our way to China?
[279:46.49]Okay.
[279:47.23]We're going to have a skydiving segment?
[279:49.41]We might.
[279:52.48]Look how much space there is.
[279:54.36]We just had our Chinese airspace.
[279:57.46]Good.
[280:03.72]We have like a passenger jet?
[280:08.66]I don't know.
[280:09.00]If somebody asks me if I'm an organ donor, why are you asking me that?
[280:13.20]What's your blood type?
[280:14.40]I have no idea.
[280:16.94]Do you know your blood type?
[280:17.99]I actually don't.
[280:18.59]I have no idea.
[280:19.47]I'm telling you.
[280:20.17]Final boss, Zeus.
[280:35.59]I'm very curious what the boss will be on this campaign.
[280:43.29]What's the EMP in here?
[280:45.60]No, they turned into these things.
[280:52.58]Oh, we nuked it, bud.
[280:54.32]What, one of these things is in here?
[280:56.48]Yeah, it's the Dark Souls.
[280:58.02]You thought this was a boss, but now it's a normal elite enemy.
[281:01.88]Oh, we still have to fight this on the plane?
[281:04.78]Oh my goodness.
[281:09.38]Just open up the door.
[281:12.28]Just suck him out.
[281:22.29]We can't go back any further.
[281:23.77]Okay.
[281:28.29]Okay.
[281:32.50]Oh, that's a new gun.
[281:34.79]lightning hawk uh deagle that's actually pretty cool hey do you know how to fly this thing there's something wrong with the pressure bulkhead you're gonna go back to the tail of the plane find out what's wrong it's the magnum nice I'm saving this to the last 10 seconds of the game there's a lot of fairly calm people who are about to turn into zombies yeah
[282:03.75]They're already sitting.
[282:05.11]They've been sitting.
[282:06.87]Calm down, everyone.
[282:09.09]Relax.
[282:09.85]Don't panic.
[282:13.26]We're just two heavily armed civilians running through the plane looking for the zombie.
[282:18.72]This is Men in Black music.
[282:21.20]I mean, there's a lot of people in suits with sunglasses, so we might be onto something here.
[282:30.87]I can't even hear it.
[282:33.26]OK.
[282:41.82]I'm going down.
[282:43.16]How deep does this plane go?
[282:45.01]I I I don't know.
[282:49.71]Here we go.
[282:50.15]5 grand.
[282:51.17]Do I have to help you?
[282:55.97]I got it.
[282:57.30]The big red valve.
[282:59.88]Nobody's coming.
[283:04.86]So, hold on.
[283:05.86]There's nobody flying the plane right now, right?
[283:07.95]Correct.
[283:08.87]This is kind of weird.
[283:10.39]I assume it's on autopilot, but also there's a hole in the ceiling of the plane.
[283:14.99]And, uh, hot steam pouring out of some oddly placed... I think we just have to be quick about it.
[283:23.65]Did you just shoot the la-
[283:28.52]I'll get this one.
[283:29.40]I don't think the Ouroboros thing was in this game, was it?
[283:35.31]I thought they got rid of that.
[283:36.03]Didn't they move to something else?
[283:38.09]Oh.
[283:38.19]Oh, God.
[283:57.71]What if the monster in Alien looked like that, crawling through the... That would be kind of cool.
[284:03.89]...in like 1979.
[284:04.37]I don't even know when the Alien came out.
[284:07.40]Open the hatch.
[284:08.20]We gotta get the gas out of here.
[284:09.14]We have to get rid of it!
[284:12.90]We need to open the hatch!
[284:13.50]It's just... That's just a... How do we open the hatch?
[284:16.06]Oh, shit.
[284:16.50]Right here.
[284:16.84]He's just a super soaker.
[284:18.71]Alright.
[284:19.19]Protect me.
[284:19.59]I gotta open this.
[284:22.09]He's getting closer.
[284:25.29]Ohhhh.
[284:31.63]I'm going to try again.
[284:32.33]Alright.
[284:36.36]Let's dump him.
[284:41.62]Get dumped.
[284:43.22]Uh, we're lighter than it.
[284:45.80]He's gone.
[285:00.64]Wouldn't we have flown off already?
[285:02.88]Holy shit.
[285:03.78]See you later.
[285:08.47]I was not ready for the space R. You've had more practice with that than me.
[285:14.21]Just curl up into a ball and hope for the best.
[285:18.85]Hey, anytime you wonder what happened to your luggage next time you take a flight, just remember this could be your passenger flight.
[285:26.12]Space plus R, dude.
[285:28.96]Dude, you fucking fell off.
[285:30.76]I almost got hit by that one.
[285:43.63]I'm gonna win.
[285:44.81]I'm gonna win.
[285:53.94]You just spread the virus.
[285:55.30]That's true.
[285:56.00]We just dumped that thing on top of the city.
[286:00.27]Not my problem anymore.
[286:01.59]Oh.
[286:02.73]Okay.
[286:04.51]Elena, we have to go.
[286:05.57]I have zero shotgun left.
[286:13.62]Oh, great.
[286:14.38]Everybody... Everybody turned.
[286:17.16]Yeah.
[286:17.32]Yeah.
[286:23.56]I'm just going to... I'm just running.
[286:34.39]I... Okay.

[287:15.98]No, it's... I can't shoot the gun.
[287:24.33]Is it kind of like in The Thing?
[287:25.93]Where there's like a crew of people, but one of them is not actually a person.
[287:31.83]Dude, I think we took too long.
[287:32.95]This thing is going down, man.
[287:39.26]Jesus Christ, how much worse can this get?
[287:41.47]Um, so what do we do?
[287:42.79]Hold on, hold on, I got it.
[287:43.74]Is it like when they're being too noisy and you have to go, shush?
[287:47.00]I have to... No.
[287:47.92]I have to... Um, and where is that?
[288:11.18]I didn't hear anything that she just said.
[288:14.94]I think I started a fire.
[288:16.04]No, I did that.
[288:18.66]I just pressed a button.
[288:21.37]Try it again.
[288:22.55]Try it again.
[288:23.15]Okay.
[288:23.35]I think I got it.
[288:27.27]Alright.
[288:28.77]I am... Pull the lever?
[288:31.25]The people we ran past, I guess?
[288:35.32]It's harder than it looks.
[288:37.12]Come on.
[288:40.49]I'm flying the plane, technically.
[288:46.24]Now what?
[288:48.58]Uh... What are you talking about?
[288:52.56]I'm doing it!
[289:00.95]They're making the zombies fall down.
[289:04.99]They couldn't stand up.
[289:06.75]Oh, we got like... This is rendered.
[289:08.69]It's cinematic.
[289:22.61]We should have taken the train like Ada.
[289:26.51]Actually, possibly like tens of thousands dead.
[289:35.62]They just kept having to up the ante.
[289:37.04]First they were crashing ambulances, now we're crashing subways, then trains, then going straight to double-decker planes.
[289:44.55]What are we going to crash next?
[289:48.28]You can't keep one-upping yourself.
[289:49.82]I see a ladder.
[289:50.60]We're going to go there and get the item.
[290:06.79]Who's that?
[290:07.63]That's... No, that's, um... That's the president's daughter from the fourth game.
[290:15.33]Why are they so quiet?
[290:16.75]That's wrong.
[290:17.03]Okay, uh, challenge.
[290:17.65]Read the dialog as they say it in step.
[290:19.92]Of who?
[290:20.64]What character are you?
[290:36.91]Oh, me.
[290:38.11]Okay.
[290:45.22]Let me handle this.
[290:48.72]Avoid contact with anyone.
[290:52.50]Leon's not just anyone.
[290:54.32]He saved my life back in Raccoon City.
[290:57.36]It started with inflection and it just became like a regular reading.
[291:06.15]Look out!
[291:11.75]I hope it hereditaries her.
[291:14.21]You're a psycho.
[291:22.24]It's an Overwatch character.
[291:30.03]The big monster?
[291:30.43]Yeah.
[291:37.94]Looks like Junkrat.
[291:38.93]Up close.
[291:43.95]No, it's not.
[291:46.95]Far away.
[291:47.39]It kind of looked like that.
[291:48.41]It's probably an Overwatch 2 character.
[291:49.87]Alright, here we go.
[291:50.75]Ready?
[291:51.57]I have my Magnum out and I'm going to use it.
[291:57.02]No, I didn't shoot.
[291:59.50]I don't want to miss.
[292:05.36]Where did this guy even come from?
[292:08.43]He's got a, he's, this is, this is the new dead by daylight guy?
[292:11.63]What is this?
[292:12.33]He's like got one of the civilians.
[292:14.05]Gonna go put him on a hook.
[292:19.44]Okay, I'm trying to dodge.
[292:23.64]First you right click, then you hit space, and then you hit A, L, or D. No, dodge needs to be just like space.
[292:39.90]If I have to come over there one more time.
[292:41.04]I'm just going to heal myself.
[292:44.24]No.
[292:44.68]Oh, she's got me.
[292:50.59]Get up.
[292:52.77]Heal.
[292:53.23]Why can't I heal?
[292:54.57]What's happening?
[292:55.87]I have three heals.
[292:56.73]Use them.
[292:57.41]Take it from us.
[292:57.93]This guy's indestructible.
[292:58.69]Let's get the hell out of here.
[293:03.64]Nobody's indestructible.
[293:05.72]Okay, we have a party again.
[293:06.82]You just have to find the correct cutscene.
[293:13.41]Oh, wait.
[293:13.97]Yeah, we want to go up here.
[293:15.59]There was something up here.
[293:22.47]Was there?
[293:22.77]Yeah.
[293:23.15]I don't think I even have any bullets.
[293:31.32]Wait, was this to fight him?
[293:35.30]That looks very useful.
[293:39.06]Uh-huh.
[293:41.10]Too late?
[293:41.76]Possibly?
[293:43.19]I think so.
[293:45.05]Maybe if I... Did you do that?
[293:48.73]If you did that, that's strike three.
[293:50.19]Yeah.
[293:50.51]I mean, I had... It was right in the middle.
[293:53.20]So, that's it.
[293:53.94]You struck out.
[293:54.74]That's game over.
[293:58.06]It was right in the middle.
[293:58.90]That's actually strike three, though.
[294:00.38]So, now... Now, I don't know what to do.
[294:03.16]Hold on.
[294:04.38]That's game over.
[294:05.03]No, look, look, look.
[294:07.23]Hang on.
[294:09.01]Here.
[294:09.49]Just breathe.
[294:10.83]If that doesn't heal me, then I'm... Okay.
[294:21.02]What's happening here?
[294:24.52]Now I'm about to leave again.
[294:28.72]Who is jumping over who?
[294:31.32]What?
[294:31.94]What?
[294:38.58]That was strike three.
[294:40.46]We need the barrels.
[294:42.76]We did need the barrels.
[294:43.58]He came back.
[294:46.34]My bad.
[294:47.42]My bad.
[294:49.01]We can do something here.
[294:53.33]Come back here.
[294:56.83]The NPC is helping me more than you are.
[295:01.88]I think I can fix this.
[295:02.96]I got tired of carrying the team, so I just wanted to have some fun.
[295:05.62]Also, they're supposed to.
[295:07.36]I'm fighting the big guy, and I don't know what you're doing.
[295:11.22]I am getting the car to work again.
[295:15.38]That's very cool.
[295:17.92]Watch out, because we're coming through that wall.
[295:19.96]We're coming through that wall right now.
[295:21.94]Do it.
[295:22.16]Here we go.
[295:23.28]Watch out!
[295:27.86]How did you miss?
[295:30.60]You missed!
[295:31.74]You missed!
[295:36.08]How is he still standing?
[295:38.36]Well, because she missed.
[295:40.90]Oh my god.
[295:41.82]Man, if only you had health.
[295:44.52]If only somebody didn't throw grenades at their friends in games.
[295:48.07]Okay, actually I'm gonna need... Oh, you need help?
[295:51.21]No, not yet.
[295:52.55]Not yet.
[296:00.32]There's nothing to combine this with.
[296:01.96]I was just trying to get him right there.
[296:07.34]I'm down here.
[296:07.76]If he comes down here, I can blow him up.
[296:10.06]Alright, watch out.
[296:12.03]Wait, he's like hugging the wall.
[296:17.97]Get down here.
[296:21.79]Why won't he... Just drop.
[296:29.35]Oh, we both just, like, all... We all forgot our lines.
[296:32.85]Every character, including the monster.
[296:36.46]Okay, um... We're just all standing up here.
[296:39.20]And he's, like, stuck.
[296:40.92]Is he down, finally?
[296:41.80]Alright, get over here.
[296:45.86]What the... Okay, I'm seriously sick of this.
[296:48.11]This is like a cat.
[296:50.93]He just, like, keeps climbing up the, like, shelves and ledges in the house.
[296:55.67]He's up there now.
[296:56.75]He's...
[296:58.48]You can't tell him what to do because it's a cat.
[297:00.54]He's on the other side of the map.
[297:04.18]He might just kill himself.
[297:05.80]He might actually run into the tower.
[297:07.55]Have we just tried asking him what's wrong?
[297:12.79]We may have just gotten in a lot of trouble here.
[297:16.45]We let him upgrade his arm.
[297:21.52]He found his case.
[297:23.10]Who made the scissor hand upgrade though?
[297:26.89]Alright, now I'm pulling this out.
[297:34.08]Here we go, watch out!
[297:35.50]Back up!
[297:36.00]Here it comes!
[297:36.36]Come on!
[297:36.56]Get over here!
[297:37.10]I'm holding, I'm holding.
[297:37.90]Is that a grenade?
[297:56.78]Yeah.
[297:58.46]Here he comes.
[297:58.90]Alright.
[297:59.12]Did it work?
[298:02.30]You got it.
[298:02.76]You hit him.
[298:03.90]It definitely did.
[298:04.64]Is she down or is she just... I think she's alright.
[298:12.70]He just kicked it.
[298:14.64]He just like football kicked it.
[298:20.46]Like piece of shit.
[298:22.32]Yeah, he did.
[298:32.83]There was a little kid in an action scene staring at the thing falling on them.
[298:37.50]Sherry.
[298:38.02]Still alive, maybe?
[298:44.38]Phase one?
[298:44.88]Let's just hope that Jake is as good as he thinks he is.
[298:59.66]Charlie Brown by Lucy.
[299:01.28]Well, the difference is I was standing right there and it hurt me too.
[299:04.26]So I put the football down and Charlie Brown kicked it into my face.
[299:08.02]How did I hit you?
[299:09.48]The bird convention?
[299:10.48]Alright.
[299:31.16]Family Guy did that?
[299:31.94]Family Guy did what?
[299:35.44]I have some... Oh, this actually looks like... What does this look like?
[299:43.26]Um... This place we're in right now?
[299:45.88]Like, this scene?
[299:46.48]Uh-huh.
[299:47.17]Right here.
[299:47.63]Yeah.
[299:48.01]Right?
[299:48.21]This exact place right here?
[299:49.81]Yep.
[299:50.75]Um... Another co-op game.
[299:53.57]Darkness?
[299:55.21]No, another co-op game.
[299:56.37]Another co-op game.
[299:57.39]Um... Yeah.
[299:59.35]I don't know.
[300:05.46]Neon lights.
[300:06.49]Two characters.
[300:07.79]They get naked.
[300:09.13]Oh, Kanan Lynch.
[300:10.23]Kanan Lynch.
[300:11.45]This looks like Kanan Lynch.
[300:12.85]Somebody said this part sucks.
[300:21.50]Get some plus fives in the chat.
[300:22.90]Nobody wants plus fives.
[300:32.34]Best of fruit.
[300:38.32]Oh, great.
[300:39.36]Three separate locks.
[300:41.28]No, not this.
[300:41.86]Alright.
[300:42.94]Three separate... I've updated your map.
[300:48.31]Okay, I just found, like, if there's, like, a Steam data thing, this is where, like, the most amount of people that quit the game.
[300:54.51]This all happened right there.
[300:55.45]Based on comments?
[300:56.57]Just based on, like, data of, like, in-game time and, like, in-game moment stuff.
[301:00.25]This is where everybody stopped.
[301:03.36]That was creepy.
[301:03.80]I guess that's why the whole street is on lockdown.
[301:06.10]Residents are trying to keep it out.
[301:08.25]My God.
[301:08.83]Well, this one is different.
[301:18.84]That's a new trick.
[301:23.74]Missing when we have to shoot that stuff.
[301:25.68]I don't know.
[301:26.04]He seems armored.
[301:28.68]We break the armor.
[301:29.64]Oh, OK.
[301:29.96]Then you're going to shoot guts.
[301:40.31]Fire?
[301:41.25]Probably.
[301:44.61]It's probably fire.
[301:48.31]The keys are just scattered around.
[301:50.09]The keys are kind of in here.
[301:51.49]Alright, I'm going for... That's electricity.
[301:57.94]Just go for the keys.
[302:02.26]The two of them are basically blocked.
[302:05.06]I got one back here.
[302:06.02]One down, two to go.
[302:08.52]Did he come...?
[302:13.15]Yeah, you have to split him up and shoot the goo inside.
[302:18.07]What the fuck?
[302:18.89]Holy shit, I didn't know he was there.
[302:20.07]Okay, I got a secret door open.
[302:23.05]Alright, I got one.
[302:33.60]Uhh... This way.
[302:38.29]There's one back here somewhere.
[302:39.89]The electricity.
[302:40.47]Oh, okay.
[302:40.89]That's the three keys.
[302:44.67]Can we open this?
[302:48.77]We have to like... Oh, I can turn this off.
[302:54.39]Ah, the electricity.
[302:55.56]Alright.
[302:56.30]Electricity's off.
[303:01.50]It's like a minor annoyance.
[303:04.48]We both have to do that.
[303:05.26]That's annoying.
[303:06.02]Okay, there's two.
[303:10.08]One more key left.
[303:11.68]He's kind of crawling in here.
[303:15.40]Which way should we go?
[303:18.04]I'm panicking.
[303:18.60]I don't know which way to go.
[303:22.92]I'm stuck in here now with both of them.
[303:24.65]And I'm going to die.
[303:27.59]You can come out.
[303:29.19]Oh, okay.
[303:31.41]I need to go in my inventory and heal.
[303:33.85]There's more.
[303:40.27]How do we get the key over there?
[303:41.13]We're doing Slenderman notes right now.
[303:42.56]When we pick up a new key, there's another guy.
[303:45.46]Well, how do we get- we gotta go around?
[303:47.42]Yeah, we have to go like around this way.
[303:56.49]No, not quite.
[303:58.59]No.
[303:58.71]Wait, boxes?
[303:59.85]Can't- okay.
[304:03.99]Ah, this way, probably.
[304:04.69]Can we jump this?
[304:09.54]What?
[304:10.66]There's little jumpy arms.
[304:14.89]Oh my God.
[304:15.39]Can we not go this way either?
[304:16.53]No, it's like it's behind them kind of in the middle.
[304:19.91]Oh God.
[304:20.51]Oh.
[304:25.43]OK.
[304:30.05]We're here.
[304:30.39]We need to unlock it from the other side.
[304:33.34]Oh please.
[304:37.42]Oh, please.
[304:40.71]Are you alright?
[304:42.15]Yeah.
[304:48.63]This is kind of just annoying.
[304:51.97]Okay.
[304:53.92]We have to unlock from the other side.
[304:55.70]I'm just going to follow the damn arrow.
[305:05.20]Maze level.
[305:12.84]Okay, I found a ladder.
[305:17.34]Coming.
[305:19.90]We have to go over the roof.
[305:23.50]And you have to throw me.
[305:29.39]Move in.
[305:31.27]Move in.
[305:31.91]I'm trying.
[305:37.51]Last one.
[305:38.03]Now we can get the door, right?
[305:38.79]That's a Lara Croft jump, isn't it?
[305:41.58]I don't think I can make it over there.
[305:45.04]Why did I go down?
[305:46.64]That was really dumb.
[305:47.46]Uh, I think I'm gonna open the door for you, actually.
[305:49.79]His hand is coming at me.
[305:59.01]Is it this door here?
[305:59.95]Okay, they're here.
[306:00.45]It's over here.
[306:00.87]It's over here.
[306:02.69]I'm pointing at the screen.
[306:04.31]Uh, help.
[306:08.07]Uh, Wade, where are you?
[306:10.14]Okay.

[306:40.11]Just threw something in my face.
[306:42.99]What's on me?
[306:44.75]It's probably the little jumpy hands.
[306:47.93]Oh, this is bad.
[306:49.73]Please don't kill me.
[306:55.10]One of my keys just came off.
[306:57.42]I lost my cue.
[306:58.20]My cue's not on the keyboard anymore.
[306:59.40]It's gone.
[306:59.74]Is he killing you?
[307:01.12]Dude, key is not on my keyboard anymore.
[307:02.62]What is... I can't...
[307:08.41]Unnecessarily intricate if it's a death animation.
[307:11.87]I lost my key.
[307:13.45]Actually, my Q key is gone.
[307:19.05]Please, for the love of God, don't even tell me.
[307:26.60]This is like a 60 second death scream.
[307:36.26]Thank God.
[307:38.49]Hey, you want to come in here?
[307:39.61]Do we have the three keys?
[307:43.05]No, this is actually the last... the one that I couldn't get in.
[307:45.47]Okay, they're coming down the hall.
[307:54.37]Grab the key.
[307:55.13]I'll try and... ...be teleported.

[308:11.54]Yeah.
[308:12.10]I actually like killed one.
[308:14.39]Let's go.
[308:14.81]Let's go.
[308:15.29]Let's go do it.
[308:25.43]Stop farming.
[308:26.11]I didn't.
[308:26.77]I actually was doing that.
[308:38.14]Help, I'm too weak to open this door.
[308:41.96]Unless we double roundhouse kick it simultaneous.
[308:45.80]How did you flip off the Q key?
[308:47.63]It's because I'm hitting WASD really fast and my finger got underneath Q while I was doing it.
[308:57.63]I think you just screwed that up because my bar went back down to zero.
[309:05.54]No, what the fuck?
[309:13.01]No!
[309:14.49]Why wouldn't you help me?
[309:17.15]Help!
[309:17.95]You just end up watching in shock and horror.
[309:20.51]I was shooting!
[309:21.61]I was definitely shooting the whole time.
[309:25.29]Why wouldn't you grab my ankles and yank me out of there?
[309:28.19]Alright, let's go.
[309:42.37]I gotta reload.
[309:43.53]But wait, it failed.
[309:46.41]I'm dead again, dude.
[309:47.19]Do you have a QTE?
[309:48.55]Yes.
[309:48.75]What?
[310:00.47]I'm getting some serious trauma of why I gotta like steady myself against the wall.
[310:06.25]Like, how do you report back with a debriefing?
[310:09.01]Uh, yes, my superior officer, I know you're not gonna believe me, but one of the ones that regenerates himself went head over heels into a meat grinder.
[310:19.38]Sir, I don't really know why the meat grinder was turned on in this abandoned facility.
[310:24.06]I don't even really know what the purpose of it is.
[310:27.31]But you have to believe me, he went in his whole body.
[310:32.19]Ryan is out!
[310:32.75]Okay.
[310:34.91]Well, we got it.
[310:35.35]Somebody's gonna eat that.
[310:37.55]Like, that's going into a meal.
[310:58.33]Yeah, just the fact that your character's just standing there with a blank stare while just getting double-grinded.
[311:09.29]You'd think there'd be a little bit more of a reaction from that person.
[311:11.83]Why don't we just weaponize meat grinders?
[311:15.82]It clearly worked.
[311:18.14]Like, why don't we just get, like, a transportable meat grinder to fight those zombies with?
[311:27.02]Ada!
[311:29.36]Ada, just leave the door.
[311:30.42]Please just leave the door unlocked so we don't have to go around and find three more keys.
[311:34.06]I hope that doesn't happen.
[311:35.02]I'd be so mad.
[311:38.24]Come on, let's get some answers.
[311:41.54]Shit, it's locked.
[311:43.37]Yeah, you got it.
[311:45.07]Check for ammo.
[311:54.45]I got a lot of assault rifle.
[311:57.52]Let me take inventory for a second.
[311:58.72]I have a lot of handgun.
[312:00.18]I haven't found any heals in this entire level.
[312:04.76]I have had one red herb.
[312:06.61]I could use my handgun for a little while.
[312:07.71]Alright.
[312:12.27]Down.
[312:21.08]Scared you.
[312:22.54]Yeah, almost did.
[312:25.74]We've got to make it to that elevator.
[312:27.14]Run!
[312:28.08]What?
[312:28.84]Uh, run.
[312:31.87]I- I- I- I was wrong?
[312:34.17]Just run?
[312:37.47]Glad you could stop in.
[312:40.33]Like what I've done with the place.
[312:43.59]Wait, is this Ada's facility?
[312:45.27]Oh, shit.
[312:46.17]Um... Oh, we gotta get up.
[312:52.02]It's coming back.
[312:54.31]Uh, okay.
[312:56.15]That spawned in on top of me.
[312:58.61]It doesn't hurt that bad.
[312:59.55]It doesn't really hurt that bad.
[313:00.57]It doesn't hurt that bad.
[313:05.09]We have to kick the edges.
[313:05.89]Oh, are these real people?
[313:11.31]They look real.
[313:18.13]I thought we broke them.
[313:22.76]Dude, that was way too slow.
[313:23.48]Way too slow.
[313:25.98]What's with this camera?
[313:27.46]I hated that.
[313:28.00]Yeah, that's more accurate.
[313:56.89]Wait.
[313:58.35]Boxes.
[314:02.89]I'm sorry.
[314:04.23]Strike one.
[314:04.79]That's strike one.
[314:06.05]No, you don't get to give me strikes for your behavior this stream.
[314:09.68]It's minus one strike.
[314:17.12]This is definitely a boss here.
[314:20.74]Not yet.
[314:22.20]Getting there.
[314:26.41]Well.
[314:29.83]It's not big enough.
[314:30.89]They're giving us a lot of stuff.
[314:32.71]Yeah.
[314:33.69]This isn't the room though.
[314:35.19]We might see it.
[314:37.17]I would love to walk a little faster.
[314:38.51]Okay.
[314:55.37]It's definitely just to survive the room.
[314:58.07]Probably.
[315:01.56]Robots.
[315:03.06]Did they explode?
[315:08.44]Is that what it is?
[315:09.64]I don't know.
[315:10.32]One of them did.
[315:12.74]They are.
[315:13.70]They explode if you don't shoot them first.
[315:17.64]You got to kick them away.
[315:19.70]Kick him away?
[315:20.38]Okay, hold on.
[315:21.58]Well, like, I mean, like, just knock him away.
[315:23.36]The gun.
[315:23.94]Stay in the corner.
[315:24.72]Oh!
[315:24.94]Watch out!
[315:25.62]I have to do a... Oh, this is bad.
[315:27.78]Uh... Damn it.
[315:28.08]Whatever.
[315:28.38]I hope I hit yes.
[315:29.44]I think I just pressed no.
[315:30.26]Uh-oh.
[315:50.50]Uh, nope, we're good.
[316:00.36]Double zero.
[316:03.08]Leon.
[316:05.65]Knowing bird.
[316:06.73]I'm the great Leon!
[316:09.19]The strike two.
[316:15.25]Moving.
[316:22.50]Let me skip this.
[316:26.14]It's just so dumb.
[316:34.42]Alright, we actually should just sit in the corner and just use pistols.
[316:36.92]No, I have to hack a computer.
[316:38.20]Okay, so I will make sure.
[316:39.42]I'm going to defend you with my pistols.
[316:41.98]With your pistols?
[316:42.64]Don't we have like five better weapons than that by now?
[316:45.62]You can shoot.
[316:46.05]You only need to shoot him once.
[316:50.80]They take one hit, then they go away and they blow up.
[316:54.02]I got it.
[316:58.54]Where's the panel?
[316:59.22]Is it right here?
[317:00.82]Okay, I'm ready.
[317:02.68]I will protect you.
[317:05.24]Or I will try.
[317:05.80]I really thought things were going to come out of the tube.
[317:11.12]It's not like the infinite robot army.
[317:16.04]God damn it!
[317:17.70]I'm relaxed.
[317:18.34]I'm fine.
[317:20.86]I, like, sensed something was wrong and just dodged out of the way.
[317:24.42]Watch out behind you.
[317:27.99]I can't actually hack yet, so... What about... What happens if you have to shoot them once?
[317:37.19]You do.
[317:37.57]They bounce back.
[317:39.23]Oh, okay.
[317:39.53]But you have to kill them.
[317:40.81]Alright, I'm hacking now.
[317:44.24]I'm actually playing dead by daylight.
[317:46.22]Okay.
[317:50.92]I'm starting to generate right now.
[317:52.86]Why do I need to see that cutscene?
[317:56.76]Ow, why are you shooting me?
[318:05.37]I'm not shooting you.
[318:06.53]I have not shot you once.
[318:08.65]Blood was coming out.
[318:13.45]How's it going?
[318:17.36]It's going great, actually.
[318:19.55]I think we're through.
[318:20.73]I'm, like, faster than the voice is over.
[318:22.17]Crack Ada.
[318:22.45]Shit.
[318:22.95]Ooh, we got stuff here.
[318:28.91]5k.
[318:29.09]10k.
[318:29.17]Nice.
[318:29.37]Ooh.
[318:48.89]This is the loot room.
[318:50.53]This has to be.
[318:51.53]Like, we have to be near the end of the game, right?
[318:53.47]Have to be.
[318:54.89]Uh, yeah.
[318:57.01]I think we're catching up to the prologue.
[318:58.79]The prologue was definitely like a... I imagine the final chapter is probably just like a final finale.
[319:05.50]We're gonna have to kill the unkillable guy.
[319:09.34]Which is very Resident Evil.
[319:11.06]The guy that, like, we've dropped the metal tower on.
[319:14.20]Who's up there?
[319:22.15]Ada, if you didn't have so many voice lines, we would shoot you.
[319:28.94]She just did a magician smoke.
[319:38.25]She has a grapple gun and smoke bombs.
[319:41.85]Are we supposed to jump over here?
[319:48.77]She keeps getting these little cutscenes that- Oh, it's her- Can we just fight her?
[319:55.34]No, you can't shoot her.
[319:56.16]She's one of the main characters.
[319:59.72]She has a campaign.
[320:00.98]It's probably her perspective.
[320:06.28]Who the fuck is that?
[320:12.26]Is that Chris?
[320:16.13]Who is this person?
[320:23.72]One of us is Chris.
[320:25.80]Oh, it's... Which brown hair hero?
[320:31.91]Why am... Have you seen like the gif of Chris Redfield like naked with like a banana in his hand and he's like, get out of here!
[320:43.59]And like it's like dad, whatever it is.
[320:45.69]No.
[320:48.73]But now I'm going to have Chris Redfield naked in my search history.
[320:51.73]No, no, hold on.
[320:52.48]I've got to say that again.
[320:57.86]Okay, there's a gif where it's like Chris Redfield in his underwear.
[321:01.80]And it's like when you try to get dad's food.
[321:04.94]And it's like, get out of here.
[321:06.05]And he has like a banana in his hand.
[321:07.27]Now I'm going to have to search Chris Redfield mostly naked in my search history.
[321:12.41]No, he's in like bike shorts.
[321:13.93]I swear to God, this is a gif.
[321:18.09]Chris Redfield in bike shorts.
[321:19.77]It's like Chris Redfield.
[321:25.19]He's putting his clothes on.
[321:26.29]Is that it?
[321:26.67]Is that the gif?
[321:27.17]He's getting progressively more clothes.
[321:28.98]He's like in the kitchen and he's got like a banana.
[321:32.88]And it's like zooms up and he's like... Okay, what's he doing with the banana?
[321:37.60]He's just holding it.
[321:38.52]And he said, you should have left it alone, Ethan.
[321:40.88]You sure he's not like eating it?
[321:42.82]I need to look this up because I swear to God this is real.
[321:54.31]nude mod well I gotta make sure this is real Chris Chris Redfield okay Chris Redfield is she immune to smoke and flashbangs is that her superpower Chris Redfield banana kitchen gif he's playing with the controller I swear to god I'm not insane
[322:29.60]I can't write this.
[322:39.60]I can't type this.
[322:41.26]Yeah, you have to search for it.
[322:42.50]That's what I mean.
[322:42.96]How are you going to search for it?
[322:43.99]I don't want to type in Chris Redfield naked with banana in hand.
[322:48.57]That's what I'm saying.
[322:51.55]Hopefully the game doesn't crash.
[322:54.59]Have you been alt tabbed this whole time?
[322:58.76]I got it!
[323:00.44]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[323:01.40]Hold on.
[323:13.89]Hold on, I need to- Is this T- This is not TOS, I don't think.
[323:17.79]I might get- Hold on, I need to show this.
[323:21.43]Hold on, just wait.
[323:22.27]I promise it's gonna be worth it.
[323:23.47]I promise.
[323:23.67]Alright, the cutscene's over.
[323:24.55]We're just chillin'.
[323:25.39]Nothin' scary's happenin'.
[323:31.22]My side will be for the story.
[323:32.52]The subtitles are still on.
[323:33.68]Your side will be for naked Chris Redfield with a banana.
[323:38.61]Balanced co-op content.
[323:39.89]Is it showing?
[323:40.49]Hold on.
[323:46.25]What do you mean?
[323:46.63]I can't show you.
[323:47.31]I don't know.
[323:50.09]He's got the link.
[323:51.57]Okay, I got it.
[324:06.54]Has anybody seen this?
[324:16.68]Have you seen that before, Etalyx?
[324:18.76]No, but this is the first thing that came up for me.
[324:23.33]Why can't I get this to turn off?
[324:25.99]Sailor Boy Chris disarms Daddy Ethan Banana.
[324:33.31]We have to move on.
[324:33.73]We have to move on now.
[324:34.69]I'm not sure if this is the right thing or not, but that's what I found.
[324:38.81]Alex, we've got to move on right now.
[324:40.04]This is going to get really bad.
[324:44.60]He's holding a can of food.
[324:45.88]I thought it was a banana.
[324:49.28]I can't turn this off.
[324:50.22]Why?
[324:50.30]Okay.
[325:01.02]I'm really sorry but like I let's go I I think I found my own can of worms are you good I'm back I found the I found a different banana yeah be careful apparently there's a series of them don't write that don't type in Chris Redfield's banana I please don't write that nobody I'm serious that like not it's not what I was looking for I was looking for that gif you good
[325:30.15]Uh-huh.
[325:30.67]Yeah.
[325:31.95]I've now seen Chris Redfield in a very tight sailor costume taking a banana from Daddy Ethan.
[325:43.34]I'm so sorry.
[325:46.04]And so has everybody else.
[325:49.84]Did we just get raided from Vinny?
[325:53.42]Oh, my God.
[325:53.97]I'm so sorry.
[325:54.91]Our target is Simmons.
[325:56.59]Always has been.
[325:57.93]You don't regret not following her, do you?
[326:01.78]Thank you so much for the raid.
[326:03.32]Welcome, everybody.
[326:04.18]Oh, make sure to like, follow, and subscribe.
[326:07.14]I did not expect we were going to show that.
[326:09.08]But I had to show that.
[326:11.08]But thanks, Vinny.
[326:15.02]But you understand, like, Etalyx, listen.
[326:17.17]This is really important.
[326:18.91]If I didn't show that, then people would have thought I was fucking nuts.
[326:23.43]You know what I mean?
[326:24.89]Yeah, no, no, no.
[326:25.55]That was the deciding characteristic.
[326:28.93]That had to be shown.
[326:30.17]Otherwise, like, how would people... How could I ever describe that?
[326:37.19]You described that I found something... Apparently tangentially related, and I still think... I put you on a wild goose chase, and you ended up somewhere else.
[326:49.11]I'm sorry.
[326:51.43]Well, this is unexpected.
[326:57.54]No, wait!
[326:59.73]Ah, Agent Birkin.
[327:00.91]Impeccable timing.
[327:02.03]Kindly take these two into custody, won't you?
[327:04.25]They say they were involved in the terrorist attack.
[327:06.91]Hopefully that's not bad to show them.
[327:08.73]Why are they running down the street screaming into anyone who listens?
[327:11.28]He's in bike shorts.
[327:11.78]It's fine.
[327:12.42]It's for the benefit of the United States and global security.
[327:17.48]You can't see how killing the president is good for the country.
[327:24.48]It was a thong?
[327:35.26]It's a speedo.
[327:35.96]It's fine.
[327:36.65]It's a guy in a speedo.
[327:38.43]People wear that shit to the beach, guys.
[327:40.31]Okay?
[327:40.89]You want me to show you the one that I found?
[327:42.51]Maybe in private.
[327:44.89]Okay.
[327:46.03]I'm gonna start a new folder.
[327:48.11]No.
[327:48.61]I mean, like, not on stream.
[327:51.26]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[327:52.04]No, I get you.
[327:52.98]I understand.
[327:54.22]We're talking over the cutscene.
[327:57.74]We have to listen.
[327:58.30]Thanks.
[327:58.64]I'll put a call into FOS, get you some protection.
[328:16.95]I can't believe I'm the only person that knew about that.
[328:19.67]I thought it was like a funny meme that everybody knew.
[328:25.19]It's about to get a big boost in popularity.
[328:33.56]There are already at least like five artists hard at work right now.
[328:50.38]It's living rent-free in my head right now.
[328:52.38]I'm sorry.
[328:54.92]Or am I?
[329:10.99]Did we do it?
[329:11.84]I think we did it.
[329:15.62]I like that scene from Matrix Reloaded.
[329:17.18]It's cool.
[329:21.72]I hope they do another matrix in like 25 years and they're all like agent smith everybody's in the old folks home That's I would watch it keanu reeves reprises it they're playing bingo you can't go on top You can't start on top of the train in the train sequence you end up there you can start up there There's nothing well look what something's gonna break through the door.
[329:44.31]It's gonna be a couple of zombies.
[329:45.71]We should just run
[329:50.49]Can we please... No.
[329:52.21]I'm just saying, this is wasting a lot of taxpayer money keeping these public transportation rails open when no one's using them.
[329:57.97]We're coming for you, Simmons!
[330:01.69]I have to read this out loud.
[330:03.61]Listen, chat.
[330:04.27]I had to show you the gif.
[330:05.41]I had to show you Chris Redfield's banana.
[330:07.24]Otherwise, everyone would think I was insane.
[330:11.04]That's pretty in line with what you said, yeah.
[330:13.82]Yes.
[330:16.04]Do you not agree that... Because people didn't know what I was talking about.
[330:19.85]I have to prove that it existed.
[330:21.27]Here's the thing about Chris Redfield's banana.
[330:23.26]You can't show me a banana without expecting me not to peel it.
[330:26.22]I'm gonna peel the banana.
[330:27.23]Oh, you need to stop.
[330:47.79]What a waste of a sequence, right?
[330:49.41]Why didn't we just show up on top of the train?
[330:51.46]We just walked through the train.
[330:52.78]We didn't even need to do that.
[330:54.16]Now we're gonna be on top.
[330:55.80]Look at the hair.
[331:13.04]I recognize this guy.
[331:15.92]Who's this voice actor?
[331:19.83]Yeah, I recognize it too.
[331:23.31]Oh, I know.
[331:35.41]I know who it is.
[331:37.55]Do you?
[331:39.03]Yep.
[331:39.63]It's right on the tip of my tongue.
[331:41.85]He's an anime voice actor, and he's in the dub of Jujutsu Kaisen, among other things.
[331:48.76]Oh, is it, um... Tuna.
[331:52.48]Salmon.
[331:53.22]He's the teddy bear guy.
[331:56.60]Bonita Flakes.
[331:57.42]That woman.
[332:00.40]How dare she do this to me?
[332:11.88]I still don't have a Q key, by the way.
[332:13.49]Hope we don't need to use it.
[332:16.03]Did you pop the cap off or something?
[332:19.09]Yeah.
[332:24.69]Alright.
[332:28.85]Wait.
[332:32.34]Oh, yeah.
[332:33.02]Okay, yeah.
[332:35.00]He just...
[332:37.51]This guy looks like a Pokémon.
[332:39.47]Back up.
[332:39.75]We're too close!
[332:42.97]Let's move!
[332:43.33]Oh, there's nowhere to go!
[332:44.21]Oh, shit.
[332:45.03]Okay.
[332:45.25]Let's get some distance while we have the chance!
[332:49.71]Sure.
[332:51.13]That was a really bad cut in the movie.
[332:52.77]I'll kill you with my bare hands!
[332:57.27]But I tell you, though, we have to end up on top of the train, and then... Oh, man.
[333:05.02]We gotta get up.
[333:05.52]I'm stuck.
[333:09.50]I can't.
[333:10.14]Honest to God, I can't think of a worse thing to put in the game than to have it be like a slide if you press the button.
[333:16.26]Like, who wants the slide?
[333:17.30]Nobody wanted the slide.
[333:18.90]The slide just causes problems.
[333:30.11]What do we do when we get to this end of the train?
[333:32.09]He's on top.
[333:33.87]He's gonna smash through.
[333:34.91]I already pushed space.
[333:37.01]See if you can push space on the door.
[333:39.31]Um, no?
[333:40.57]I just, I looked like I could.
[333:43.09]Defeat mutated Derek.
[333:44.97]I think we, oh boy.
[333:47.11]Why are all the characters in this game like Brian?
[333:48.95]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[333:49.39]Come here, come here, come here.
[333:50.31]Derek.
[333:51.35]I, I could just put you up.
[333:52.13]Why did they want me to push you up?
[334:03.62]Damage.
[334:05.92]Damage.
[334:08.74]Holy shit.
[334:14.67]Alright.
[334:19.57]I don't know why I'm up here.
[334:23.39]I don't know.
[334:24.17]Can he do anything interesting?
[334:25.85]He's coming up to you.
[334:26.59]I'm shooting him in a very... I'm shooting him somewhere.
[334:38.12]Where's the remote?
[334:39.18]Why can't I pick up the remote bomb?
[334:46.44]Can you do that thing where you punch him again?
[334:50.80]Now I can, actually.
[334:53.10]Stop.
[334:53.74]No.
[334:55.40]This movie sucks, by the way.
[335:05.48]When did you say Will Ferrell shows up in this?
[335:12.50]Does he have his own campaign?
[335:15.80]I have to just run away from him?
[335:20.26]I can't believe the Eternals copied the villain from Resident Evil 6.
[335:24.35]I didn't see that.
[335:35.65]I don't know what's happening.
[335:38.41]Uh... We're in the middle of a... I don't know what's going on.
[335:42.73]I've teleported three times, so I really don't know.
[335:45.77]He's now... He's on the other side of the train.
[335:52.44]He's got bone-shooting power.
[335:54.26]We are playing the jump cuts of a movie.
[335:57.10]That's actually what's going on.
[335:58.48]Oh, thank God.
[336:00.76]Okay, I'm going to... Hang on.
[336:01.50]Just tell him to wait.
[336:02.14]I'm going to combine some herbs.
[336:03.88]He just annihilated me.
[336:04.88]I'm going to reunite you with your sister, Peter Popper.
[336:12.72]Hold on.
[336:15.74]Alright.
[336:18.99]Locking on.
[336:22.65]Oh, you can take cover.
[336:25.59]Somehow.
[336:27.81]What are we supposed to be shooting?
[336:33.12]Him?
[336:33.34]You might have a duck.
[336:38.16]He's coming back in.
[336:38.94]Shoot him in the face.
[336:41.90]He's got a face.
[336:43.97]God fucking damn it.
[336:45.53]I hate this game.
[336:46.50]I hate it so much.
[336:47.90]It wouldn't be space R if we were playing on controller.
[336:55.16]Where's my... Space R. Who even has their hands over there?
[337:04.49]Nobody.
[337:04.79]Oh.
[337:11.22]Alright, mutant Derek, we're coming for you.
[337:23.27]Alright, let's go.
[337:26.43]Let's go.
[337:27.11]Alright, let's make some herbs.
[337:31.05]There's a green herb back here.
[337:35.66]Why am I not allowed to pick it up?
[337:37.42]Let's go.
[337:42.21]Oh, your inventory can get full.
[337:45.13]Can it?
[337:47.25]Do I just have 300 pistol rounds?
[337:49.29]Alright, can you just keep killing the boss?
[337:54.41]Yep.
[337:54.63]I'm putting damage on him.
[337:57.11]I just learned about this.
[337:58.79]Let's go.
[337:59.35]Alright, I'm helping now.
[338:05.33]Okay, he's going to do the thing.
[338:06.46]Space R. Be ready.
[338:09.23]Here he comes.
[338:09.63]Okay.
[338:09.89]I just shot you like six times because you walked in front of me.
[338:12.61]Okay.
[338:13.15]I thought he got you.
[338:20.90]No.
[338:21.10]I got that.
[338:25.04]I picked up the smash item.
[338:27.08]Alright.
[338:27.46]He's up here.
[338:29.60]Other train.
[338:30.16]Alright.
[338:35.22]Don't worry.
[338:35.54]There was no one on that train either.
[338:42.32]It gave us control for a second.
[338:45.05]What?
[338:51.51]Did we win?
[338:52.05]I don't know.
[338:53.07]I shot him with a sniper rifle.
[338:56.79]I shot him like two or three times with a sniper.
[338:59.80]This is the worst boss fight of any Resident Evil game, I think.
[339:04.80]Yeah, but that's kind of why I actually like it.
[339:07.73]We didn't even really get a chance to fight him.
[339:09.49]Like, it was just kind of shoot him a little bit, and then there's a cutscene where we teleport around, and then he gets hit by a train.
[339:16.36]I just love how much time went into the, like, seven different cutscenes that are mostly uninteractable that lead up to this point.
[339:24.98]This is very bizarre.
[339:30.78]Is there actually more?
[339:36.41]Oh, that's what it reminds me of.
[339:37.55]The Edge of Tomorrow enemies.
[339:39.55]Except with more bones.
[339:43.18]Yo, that was sick.
[339:44.06]Good sick.
[339:44.72]Didn't even move.
[339:46.46]Yeah, you shot the metal away from my face so I could land between the eyes.
[340:04.83]Who's this?
[340:19.75]There's no way we're on the tracks.
[340:21.33]Okay.
[340:23.49]That's got to be Wesker.
[340:24.71]Like, who other suit guy is there?
[340:28.12]They put a bunch in the games.
[340:29.56]Or is it, dude, this game sucks.
[340:36.94]Yeah.
[340:38.61]Yeah, it does.
[340:42.09]Yeah.
[340:45.66]Would you even say... I mean if you said the game... There's a difference in this game sucks and game sucks.
[340:52.45]Yeah, there is a difference.
[340:58.17]Are we still in the same chapter?
[341:01.36]Head for the mission objective.
[341:04.86]We're absolutely at the finale coming up here.
[341:06.44]Excuse me.
[341:16.25]Excuse me.
[341:18.30]The next chapter is the finale.
[341:25.40]I've got to complete the objective.
[341:27.49]I've got to obtain the data.
[341:29.53]Irma just wants the game to end.
[341:31.01]Yes.
[341:33.13]Do you, though?
[341:34.13]Yeah.
[341:35.05]Alright.
[341:37.13]Well, I better check to see if I have any firebombs left.
[341:44.79]No, we're going to get one big giant finale in the last chapter.
[341:49.20]We haven't gotten the rocket launcher yet.
[341:50.42]That's how you know the game's almost over.
[341:53.74]They give you a rocket launcher with like three shots in it.
[341:56.52]And they say, end the game.
[341:58.38]Definitely infected people.
[342:00.46]Who are just going to go to some safe house and mutate.
[342:04.07]Yeah.
[342:06.97]It's over.
[342:07.37]It's not over.
[342:08.03]The prologue literally has an unfinished business.
[342:11.79]Here we go.
[342:12.73]Is it?
[342:15.77]We gotta get the data!
[342:16.59]What'd I tell you?
[342:16.97]We didn't get the data!
[342:17.63]Naked Chris Redfield.
[342:18.71]It's the Chris Redfield gif.
[342:22.76]Hey, leave it alone, Ethan.
[342:47.13]Who is Jake?
[342:48.89]I've never heard of Jake.
[342:52.62]What game is he from?
[342:54.12]What?
[343:15.50]Now, the question is, is this a traditional or is this a mutation bomb?
[343:21.94]Yeah, this is an infection where it makes everybody a zombie.
[343:27.13]It's that same gas.
[343:41.90]If I were a world superpower in this universe, I would invest a lot more in, like, air defense.
[343:48.61]Like, anti-missile.
[343:50.37]And he said, why don't they just make a big pee-pee virus?
[343:55.95]I mean, I don't know.
[343:56.65]That's not a... I guess that's... I mean, they... You could just, like, turn the pills into a gas and then release that.
[344:12.98]So are we both just going to turn our backs on this and just be like, well, we tried.
[344:17.55]Oh, shit's fucked.
[344:19.65]Oh, come on.
[344:20.17]I thought I was going to have 82% accuracy.
[344:22.39]You haven't bought.
[344:22.95]Five deaths.
[344:32.89]I knew I scored.
[344:33.81]Yeah, and how many of those deaths were you killing me intentionally?
[344:36.77]Hey!
[344:38.98]We need to remember that.
[344:39.98]That's important.
[344:40.56]Each chapter I have been killed deliberately by him at least two or three times.
[344:43.65]Definitely not four.
[344:44.91]At least two or three a chapter.
[344:47.15]No.
[344:47.89]A chapter?
[344:48.83]A chapter.
[344:49.27]At least two or three.
[344:50.25]No.
[344:55.11]Are you ready to put this thing to bed?
[345:00.37]I got 30,000 points.
[345:01.29]Not enough for crit two.
[345:05.10]Alright, can I just make an actual rant about Resident Evil?
[345:09.16]It's an unpopular opinion.
[345:10.81]You have the floor.
[345:11.85]Before you say anything, though, I'm going to say I do not condone or agree with anything that he's about to say.
[345:18.40]But you have the floor.
[345:19.02]Okay.
[345:20.18]Alright, here we go.
[345:21.26]I actually hate how in every Resident Evil they lock the super fun weapons behind multi playthroughs.
[345:26.70]Just give me all the cool shit.
[345:28.28]Let me play.
[345:28.72]I got a $60 game.
[345:30.32]I kind of don't want to play through three times just to unlock the in game DLC.
[345:35.30]Just let me have all the fun stuff scattered throughout the campaign so that I can enjoy it.
[345:38.98]And I'm fine paying that money for a good experience.
[345:41.38]And then I want to put it to bed.
[345:42.30]I don't think that's that unpopular.
[345:49.35]I feel like the people who are like, I wanted my extra value, so I have reason to play through again and get like, quote unquote, $60 worth.
[345:57.66]Well, I want this.
[346:02.10]Damn it.
[346:02.48]I thought it was going to be cheaper.
[346:04.84]What the fuck?
[346:06.13]$3,000 to $28,000 for level two?
[346:07.15]Get out of here.
[346:07.69]That's what I mean.
[346:08.71]Like, some of these are clearly not going to be earnable in one campaign.
[346:12.99]I thought I was going to be able to do level two twice, whatever.
[346:15.99]This one's $70,000 for the next one.
[346:17.95]Yeah, I can't really afford anything.
[346:21.07]I'm just gonna go.
[346:22.81]Playing this game with a friend is worth it.
[346:24.59]Yeah, that's the only reason why I would play this.
[346:27.44]There's no reason to play this unless you're playing with somebody else.
[346:30.36]Co-op makes everything more fun.
[346:31.86]That's the only reason why Borderlands still exists.
[346:40.71]Alright, you good to go?
[346:42.17]Yep.
[346:42.95]Let's seal the deal on this thing.
[346:44.75]I was burying the lead.
[346:47.55]I just have a timer.
[346:51.52]Uh, yeah, I hit escape first.
[346:54.73]So what's going on here?
[346:55.79]Okay, I think we both clicked at the same time.
[347:02.57]Borderlands solo can be fun.
[347:03.82]I feel like if you're just looking to shoot stuff and pick up items, it can be fun just to have in the background.
[347:10.86]Depends.
[347:11.72]Things just got bad.
[347:12.46]Real bad.
[347:18.32]oh Borderlands can be fun solo that's someone that uh bought it with their friends they all got together to play one time and then none of their friends were ever available to play a second time so they just kept playing because nobody else would and they're trying to feel good about their purchase I didn't say that I just want to make sure everyone knows
[347:40.79]I'm the guy that did the drink my milkshake horrible noise that everybody hated before.
[347:45.03]That was him that said that.
[347:47.40]Ate me for the other thing, but not that.
[347:49.24]Wesker.
[347:50.82]Now she ain't.
[348:09.05]No one dies in this universe.
[348:11.60]Don't let him down.
[348:14.50]Not Ada.
[348:15.32]No.
[348:16.12]No way.
[348:18.64]Which characters have more plot armor?
[348:20.28]Resident Evil or Dragon Ball?
[348:22.81]My girlfriend.
[348:23.79]Echo to HQ.
[348:24.85]Can you read me?
[348:26.37]No.
[348:26.71]My girlfriend.
[348:27.85]Google my girlfriend Wesker.
[348:30.21]Let's see what comes up.
[348:31.11]What the hell are you guys doing over there?
[348:33.47]We need to evacuate.
[348:34.39]Come on.
[348:36.46]Killed off screen.
[348:37.28]Yeah.
[348:39.92]Did I just interrupt this?
[348:44.16]We did not give a shit about what that guy had to say.
[348:57.02]Is this guy gonna talk?
[349:00.74]Okay, that was very long for you to do that.
[349:05.46]Don't go near that gas!
[349:11.19]Did you see what he said?
[349:19.16]Don't go near the gas.
[349:20.06]I was hoping for something funnier, but I'll take the hit on that one.
[349:24.28]Don't go near the gas.
[349:25.34]It'll turn you embossed.
[349:31.50]Don't go near the gas or you're going to have to subscribe to Adobe to figure out how to do the rest of this tutorial by clicking the link below.
[349:38.30]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[349:41.01]Metal Mario.
[349:41.75]Alright, watch it.
[349:42.41]Turn right.
[349:44.69]Oh god, it's everywhere.
[350:02.74]In the building.
[350:04.48]Thank you.
[350:05.26]You did that.
[350:07.12]We're good.
[350:09.44]Stephen King presents.
[350:11.44]Are you trying to break the glass and let the gas in?
[350:13.66]I didn't know it was going to happen.
[350:20.65]When do we get the rocket launcher?
[350:23.21]Oh, shit.
[350:23.53]We got to go.
[350:26.21]Plate up there.
[350:29.53]One of those blue plates.
[350:31.65]Oh, come on!
[350:32.83]I didn't know it was going to be that fast.
[350:35.24]Somebody just walked on me.
[350:37.60]Okay.
[350:37.86]So we just have to move.
[350:38.60]Just run.
[350:38.90]There's a plate on the shelf.
[350:59.19]The blue plate.
[351:00.67]I can't even talk, I'm sorry.
[351:02.51]Are you still down there?
[351:03.53]What?
[351:06.71]You gotta move, man.
[351:08.45]Alright, in the elevator.
[351:35.47]Let's go.
[351:42.21]Don't put all these trinkets everywhere.
[351:46.51]Sick.
[351:50.54]I don't know where the camera's going, but it's going somewhere.
[351:54.76]We're not getting followed by the gas.
[351:56.08]Oh, my God.
[351:56.54]We got to go.
[351:57.06]Dude, we just run.
[351:58.44]Which way?
[351:59.30]Just the double doors.
[352:00.44]Hang on, hang on.
[352:01.08]There's a million people here.
[352:12.22]What a hero.
[352:13.24]Good luck.
[352:13.64]If it wasn't for that guy, we don't win.
[352:16.98]If only he didn't have a mask on, he would have survived.
[352:19.67]You can't live in this universe if you cover up your face.
[352:23.01]Yeah, you need to be on camera.
[352:24.71]Yep.
[352:25.11]You have to have lines.
[352:26.19]You have to be able to see your face.
[352:27.41]Wearing helmets are forbidden.
[352:29.77]Face covering is forbidden.
[352:30.87]You got to have full visual.
[352:34.99]Or your character can actually die.
[352:38.52]Is your sensitivity insanely high right now?
[352:44.62]It's pretty high.
[352:49.04]Hey, make sure you turn the air conditioner on to recycle air.
[352:55.14]Can you reach that in the front?
[352:56.68]Put on some fucking Spotify, dude.
[352:58.07]This is boring.
[352:59.77]Who drives around without music?
[353:01.33]Fucking weirdo.
[353:02.65]I think you got the silent Uber.
[353:07.48]Did you ask for like total silence?
[353:12.82]I actually don't listen to music either.
[353:22.67]I would listen to music, but I only have a CD player in my car.
[353:26.61]That was going to come out of the smoke, right?
[353:31.67]When was the last time you burned a CD?
[353:37.15]um I have no idea it's been a while I got defeat 500 zombies because this dude ran one over
[353:58.60]Okay, so the fun fact, we actually have to drive across mainland China.
[354:04.33]This does feel like a haunted hayride, though.
[354:06.57]We're just kind of slowly driving by all the actors.
[354:08.81]Why?
[354:08.95]The smoke cleared.
[354:09.39]Yeah, we could have gone faster if we just ran.
[354:12.33]Yeah, but we can't breathe.
[354:13.05]We could have held our breath and sprinted and gotten there faster.
[354:26.99]What if it's like skin reactive?
[354:29.44]It's not.
[354:30.00]It's when you breathe it in.
[354:36.86]Alright, going up.
[354:45.15]Good thing zombies can't climb.
[354:47.87]Sometimes they can.
[354:54.16]That guy's dead.
[354:54.80]Why didn't he just come with us?
[354:56.45]Yeah, that's weird.
[354:57.41]The gas is still going.
[355:00.95]Still haven't run out of vehicles.
[355:05.04]You know, on a... It's the same.
[355:06.46]You can't... That's...
[355:08.97]There's other miles per hour you can go that are not a hundred or zero.
[355:12.80]People need to tell the Resident Evil people just you don't have to push down all the way on the gas.
[355:17.54]It's not, we're not playing like Cruisin' USA.
[355:21.49]They're driving like they're in an arcade.
[355:23.03]It goes from like, you're going five miles an hour in a Humvee to, watch out!
[355:28.39]There's a gas tanker coming right at you and it's gonna explode!
[355:35.14]That guy was going five miles per hour.
[355:37.93]He was going like zero.
[355:39.67]You only go zero or a hundred in Resident Evil.
[355:48.51]Oh, okay.
[355:48.85]This is the prologue.
[355:50.64]I played this part.
[355:51.76]What?
[355:52.42]There's a callback.
[355:55.98]The prologue of the game starts here.
[355:59.62]And Helena's wounded.
[356:01.06]So how do we do this?
[356:03.07]Leon, it's...
[356:05.00]Maybe I'm not wounded yet, but I'm gonna be wounded, so watch out.
[356:07.80]Wait, are we about to, like, fight Dr. Robotnik?
[356:10.76]Is that what this ending is?
[356:11.77]No, no, no.
[356:13.35]Like, I get wounded somehow, and you have to carry me.
[356:16.21]And then, uh, returning enemy shows back up at the end.
[356:20.19]This way!
[356:20.55]Am I talking to you?
[356:34.45]uh maybe wait I we've changed we've changed history at the beginning of the game leon carries elena through this part oh okay we've found destinations alright we got something in here I got that alright over here
[357:02.57]Why did I do that?
[357:04.04]Why did I just check the pulse?
[357:07.56]He's dead.
[357:07.92]That was really easy.
[357:11.00]Oh, dinner plate.
[357:12.30]But at the beginning of the game, you only have like three bullets.
[357:17.90]You wouldn't understand.
[357:18.72]I did the tutorial too.
[357:34.11]Prologue doesn't have any continuity at all.
[357:36.75]Why do I need toggling aimed on sites?
[357:39.95]Um, it's more comfortable for me.
[357:41.85]I just like it better.
[357:54.34]Action Express Magnum ammo?
[357:55.62]Why can't I pick that up?
[357:59.66]I can't pick that up?
[358:00.74]Hold on.
[358:01.38]My inventory is full of shit.
[358:04.60]You have to like delete something.
[358:05.90]You end up picking up hundreds of pistol bullets over the course of the game.
[358:10.28]I got it.
[358:15.27]Do you ever randomly get nervous about being like an extra on a movie set and they're doing some kind of like, you know, being one of the zombies and the main characters are spraying bullets and then all the zombies have to dive at the same time to pretend to be dead and you're the one that like is off.
[358:29.75]Oh, like jump to the ground first.
[358:31.15]Yeah.
[358:31.45]Like last before everybody else does.
[358:33.48]Well, the thing, the director is sitting behind that's saying like, okay, down, down, down, down, down.
[358:38.34]They cut the director out.
[358:39.22]He's got like his own, they usually edit him out.
[358:42.90]Would you be one of the people that like dives to the ground, like falls backward, or does like the shoulder shimmy, where you do left shoulder, right shoulder, left shoulder, right shoulder, like you got hit, peppered like six times.
[358:51.20]Why can I, oh.
[358:54.22]Well, I would have direction because the director would be talking.
[358:56.17]But if they were just like, you know, feeling your vibe and they were just letting you pick.
[359:02.50]vibe.
[359:04.40]Alright, guys, I just want you to feel the vibe and just do whatever you want.
[359:06.69]Well, then the movie would never get made.
[359:07.95]They'd have to take a hundred takes.
[359:11.91]Yeah, but that's how it's going to go when the zoomers finally start making movies.
[359:15.91]Where are we now?
[359:18.51]Just do whatever your vibe is.
[359:25.40]I'm trying just to...
[359:35.98]Okay.
[359:37.14]Yep.
[359:37.86]Spoiler alert.
[359:38.38]There's a helicopter.
[359:43.66]And this.
[359:45.08]Oh, yeah.
[359:45.36]I remember this.
[359:46.78]Why can't I move?
[359:47.54]That's more realistic.
[359:51.40]Alright.
[359:53.00]That's how it would probably actually happen.
[359:54.81]Okay.
[359:55.05]Was I supposed to hold W or D?
[359:56.57]Because I was holding.
[359:57.03]I don't know.
[359:57.29]I was holding S. Oh, sorry.
[359:58.35]S. To try to like walk towards the camera.
[360:00.19]That's what I was doing.
[360:01.57]I don't know.
[360:01.85]Maybe it's W.
[360:03.29]Because it's a W. It might be W. I don't know.
[360:05.91]Was I running?
[360:06.41]It looked like you were running.
[360:08.69]I was holding S. Let me try it again.
[360:12.55]Are you holding S before or after Monka?
[360:16.75]Always after.
[360:20.61]Okay, I'm holding S.
[360:25.83]Holding S. I don't get it.
[360:29.80]This is easier with a controller.
[360:31.62]I don't get it.
[360:32.20]It's S. Is it S?
[360:34.00]Yeah.
[360:34.64]But he stops and he just starts walking.
[360:37.22]You have to hold space.
[360:40.14]This is actually the sprint tutorial like in the beginning of the game.
[360:45.70]Oh, shit.
[360:46.60]It's because I'm still toggled on for my aim.
[360:50.52]You're still aiming down sights?
[360:52.74]The character is still aiming because I have a script.
[360:57.52]right okay well it should be off now yeah we're good alright everybody reset take four this stunt has cost us 18 million dollars oh way more than that this is like a 10 billion dollar stuff you're just like flickering onto my screen
[361:30.32]That was like... Ada!
[361:38.68]The zombie just standing there.
[361:39.88]Yeah, why was that guy shooting?
[361:40.87]He was shooting at the cars.
[361:44.11]I thought that was in the game for a second.
[361:45.33]I was like, that was loud and it was weird.
[361:53.32]Alright, you've trained how to fly a plane.
[361:55.30]How about a helicopter?
[362:03.16]You got a chemistry final tomorrow?
[362:09.00]Well, good luck.
[362:12.80]Okay, I'm getting dizzy.
[362:13.92]Yeah, I was going to laugh out loud and not do it, but I want to get out of this.
[362:17.91]It's making me sick.
[362:20.51]Alright, I'm going to catch this guy.
[362:27.57]And when I catch him, I realize he's a zombie.
[362:29.15]And then it's, oh, no, it's a zombie.
[362:30.31]And then I have to let him go.
[362:33.19]Oh, that's right.
[362:33.85]I'm good back here, don't worry.
[362:42.31]I missed, so don't worry.
[362:44.92]I missed again.
[362:50.46]Focus on flying.
[362:51.52]I got it.
[362:51.84]You're doing great.
[363:06.13]Alright.
[363:08.51]You know, okay, are you like not, you're just not entertained at alright now, right?
[363:12.35]Like me?
[363:14.71]I am, but for the wrong reasons.
[363:17.05]When you do too much of this shit, like, I'm not entertained anymore.
[363:20.38]I'm just kind of like, I want you to breathe.
[363:23.58]I want this game to breathe.
[363:24.54]Okay, you have to remember, this is like concurrent with the Uncharted games coming up.
[363:30.77]So it was kind of like hot, you know, like the super detailed, elaborate action set pieces.
[363:39.31]Yeah, that's fine, but I want the game to breathe.
[363:43.46]I wanted to fail that, but also I didn't know if it was going to do the whole chopper scene again or not.
[363:56.86]Yeah, that would have been painful.
[363:58.34]That's probably a good call.
[364:03.63]We got a lot of boxes here.
[364:05.27]I think it's important.
[364:07.99]This is probably the final boxes of the game.
[364:09.49]I don't have any space.
[364:14.54]Yeah, neither do I. I don't want this anymore.
[364:27.03]Did you do that?
[364:28.01]Yeah.
[364:28.47]I want to combine these.
[364:34.11]Okay, you got 12 healings.
[364:35.55]Make sure your guns are, uh, whatever.
[364:39.27]You know what I mean?
[364:40.37]Just make sure your guns work.
[364:41.41]Uh-huh.
[364:43.63]There's a plate, too.
[364:49.32]Do you like upgrading guns?
[364:50.36]Sometimes, yeah.
[364:52.18]Like, would that make this, would that be, like, a good feature in this game?
[364:55.52]Yeah, that, that is missing.
[365:03.18]You upgrade your character in a weird way, right?
[365:05.44]Okay.
[365:10.06]So we're about to find out who it is.
[365:11.47]Because he's like... You're back.
[365:14.23]Alright.
[365:15.33]If Wesker walks around that pillar, I'll give you 50 bucks.
[365:19.47]Okay.
[365:20.07]Alright.
[365:21.23]I bet it's either Wesker or the unkillable guy we dropped the metal thing on.
[365:24.88]Alright.
[365:31.90]There's a lot of explosives in that truck bed.
[365:37.65]Why do we care about that guy?
[365:39.03]Like, we've walked over a thousand corpses.
[365:42.93]It's... not Wesker.
[365:44.95]Is it just the... suited... villain?
[365:48.01]It is.
[365:48.27]From the train?
[365:50.27]Yeah.
[365:50.93]Well... It's, uh... Oh, Ada's gonna throw us the rocket launcher like she does in every game, right?
[366:02.45]Looks like Jake Gyllenhaal and Willem Dafoe That's cool I just said that's cool That's cool
[366:31.81]I was reading chat.
[366:34.87]I'm sorry.
[366:35.71]Okay, here we go.
[366:42.67]Let's defeat Derek.
[366:45.34]Just explode this.
[366:46.18]It's right next to him.
[366:49.44]Big red tanker does not explode.
[366:54.34]Holy shit.
[366:56.40]This is the coolest part of the whole game.
[366:58.60]This is awesome.
[367:04.68]Wow.
[367:05.10]With the helicopters.
[367:08.68]Oh, you gotta shoot him in the eye.
[367:09.62]He's got an eye in front.
[367:10.40]In his mouth.
[367:11.82]Oh, yeah.
[367:12.08]I played Horizon.
[367:14.82]Oh, now we get on.
[367:15.64]We get down.
[367:15.92]We step on his head.
[367:23.63]Get him!
[367:26.63]You're closer.
[367:27.53]Melee him.
[367:28.49]Go melee him.
[367:31.67]Yeah.
[367:32.55]Yeah, Derek.
[367:36.43]Alright, unload.
[367:37.39]That'll teach you to jump the turnstile at the subway station, Derek.
[367:46.36]Oh.
[367:50.14]I gotta get the fuck away from him.
[367:53.58]I can't.
[367:55.62]His boxes are on the edges, too.
[367:56.64]I got an explosion.
[368:05.39]Another car is 100 miles an hour, baby.
[368:08.07]Oh yeah.
[368:13.72]Pet the dog.
[368:14.58]Alright, get it.
[368:26.84]It's a turret section.
[368:34.20]Mine stopped working.
[368:34.86]Yeah, I think it overheated.
[368:42.68]Okay, this whole game sucked until this last 30 seconds.
[368:47.36]Here he comes.
[368:51.79]Get ready.
[368:52.49]Did we not do it?
[368:53.61]Yeah, we did it.
[368:54.63]He's got eyes in his chest, too.
[368:58.45]Unload on that fucking vest!
[369:01.97]Whoever's driving this thing deserves some applause.
[369:05.09]They're working with very limited space, and they're honestly doing a pretty great job.
[369:10.22]Can they stop doing cutscenes?
[369:12.84]Well, that guy died.
[369:13.92]He was in the driver's seat when it fell off.
[369:17.06]And he exploded.
[369:19.00]Are we running at 120 FPS and the game's shit's happening too fast or something?
[369:29.03]Alright, he's going back into his form.
[369:31.57]You wanna get this one?
[369:32.65]Yeah, I got this one.
[369:34.81]Get him!
[369:40.25]Get him!
[369:41.27]I'm trying!
[369:58.92]Get off, you fucking dumbass.
[370:03.79]Can I get that- use that machine gun?
[370:07.51]Oh, I think I just blow up a can by you.
[370:09.73]I'm okay.
[370:12.83]I'll get this one.
[370:20.46]That's strike four, by the way.
[370:21.60]I just want to make sure you're aware.
[370:22.68]I haven't- I haven't done anything yet.
[370:27.13]See, what you don't know is once you get up, he's going to transform.
[370:29.43]Then you're going to move out of the way, and then I'm going to blow it.
[370:31.30]See?
[370:31.78]Alright.
[370:32.48]Now, now move away.
[370:33.30]Blow it!
[370:34.76]Not yet.
[370:35.42]Wait, wait, wait.
[370:36.14]He's probably invulnerable.
[370:39.12]Now.
[370:41.00]Okay, he screamed, and I can't do it.
[370:42.28]There we go.
[370:43.86]I did it.
[370:45.76]It, like, didn't affect him at all.
[370:51.02]I'm going to come down there.
[370:52.32]Wait.
[370:52.94]Is there any magnum bullets?
[370:54.32]Come on.
[371:06.72]to fly the chopper and shoot the mini bird he's going down right in his face okay now we're gonna have to like mag dump hey to relax all this will she won't she tension well this is we've shooted from the oh
[371:38.10]Let's hope the elevator still works.
[371:40.85]We're not done.
[371:41.27]What's wrong?
[371:47.11]There's nothing.
[371:49.43]Let's go.
[371:49.81]But that was not the last boss.
[371:57.16]It just keeps going.
[371:59.94]You guys have to carve him.
[372:00.82]You only have 60 seconds.
[372:05.34]Carve him?
[372:06.12]What, like a...
[372:07.10]Yeah, like Monster Hunter.
[372:08.08]Well, the thing is, that would have been actually really funny if we had done that boss for 45 straight minutes.
[372:16.83]And we did it without cats.
[372:18.35]Yeah.
[372:20.77]And then we retried it like five times.
[372:25.12]It's only 45 minutes if you suck ass.
[372:27.22]Yeah, I didn't say the quality of our gameplay.
[372:31.62]I just said... Hold on.
[372:34.52]It's probably a QTE.
[372:48.84]Um... I just took your place.
[372:54.70]You have to climb first, so we have to do this together.
[372:56.84]Okay, um...
[373:10.17]I feel like I'm going too slow.
[373:11.80]I'm going too slow.
[373:15.20]I'm afraid I didn't want to overtake you.
[373:16.88]Uh-huh.
[373:19.62]He's moving over there.
[373:22.30]Who else is up there?
[373:23.36]Ada?
[373:24.50]Uh, it's Ada.
[373:25.46]Oh, that's probably like the Ada boss fight.
[373:27.51]Hold on, wait.
[373:28.39]Don't you kind of want to see what happens?
[373:31.51]I think they probably are both in god mode right now.
[373:33.59]Are they in god mode, do you think?
[373:42.12]Why does she knock off Spider-Man in this game?
[373:45.28]I don't know, but I think she... Wait, she's probably going to die.
[373:56.30]Um, do we have sniper rifle ammo?
[374:03.06]Oh, now she gets to beat him up.
[374:04.50]We cannot reliably do anything from back here.
[374:07.16]Okay.
[374:13.50]How?
[374:14.02]I can't even... Do you have any sniper rifle ammo?
[374:17.90]I have nothing.
[374:19.56]Do we even have to shoot it?
[374:21.90]What's the objective?
[374:22.98]It's just protect Ada.
[374:23.98]Did it reach?
[374:31.49]Ada, can you come fight over here?
[374:38.57]Ada, just grapple.
[374:39.79]Literally, just grapple away.
[374:44.99]Okay, she finally is doing the beat down.
[374:55.06]She has to do it three times too.
[375:02.55]Oh, the zombie that comes to our side is so we can... They're like delivering ammo.
[375:10.56]Who designed this segment?
[375:13.65]Let's go like hurry up Zero or a hundred good to climb again Well, I thought I had whatever I am just get two or three in front of me One two one two get in front of me Why I there was no prompt that was just you have to catch me.
[375:41.85]I think I just have to get you I
[375:44.58]Okay, go ahead.
[375:45.76]1, 2, 1, 2.
[375:46.56]1, 2, 1.
[375:48.42]Alright.
[375:49.30]I think you have enough space.
[375:52.04]Am I too close?
[375:57.54]Oh, shit.
[375:59.38]Shoot him.
[375:59.91]Now.
[376:02.59]Uh... I have this space in R here.
[376:04.67]Be careful.
[376:05.55]Have you seen videos of, like, bears climbing trees?
[376:09.61]Yeah, they can do some crazy shit.
[376:12.08]That's what this reminds me of.
[376:12.92]I like the noise.
[376:29.52]It's like they sampled clips of random orchestrated music from a hundred different games and movies and just slapped them all together.
[376:35.27]It does.
[376:39.33]It's like every Marvel movie, every horror movie.
[376:44.65]Are you down there?
[376:45.61]Go punch him in the face.
[376:48.43]I can't move.
[376:51.69]I actually can't do anything.
[376:54.80]Where are you?
[376:55.93]I'm, like, up here giving support, I guess.
[377:03.02]Ada, you made me waste every single magnum shot!
[377:05.74]I don't- Are you next- You gotta be next to Ada and do the revive?
[377:09.04]The V?
[377:11.24]Revive?
[377:11.74]I was just making that up, I don't know.
[377:14.00]This is a waste of goddamn time.
[377:15.72]What the fuck am I doing?
[377:19.58]Is this what it feels like to be, like, a regular Marine in a Godzilla movie?
[377:25.70]Alright, hopefully we can get you back here.
[377:28.06]Are you across?
[377:29.46]No, I'm like up in the tower up here.
[377:32.76]This is dangerous, but I need that ammo.
[377:39.17]He just changed.
[377:41.81]He was not that.
[377:43.21]He did not look like that a second ago.
[377:45.37]I'll tell you.
[377:47.74]I'm just going to use...
[377:52.76]Shoot him in the head or where?
[377:54.06]I'm shooting him in the ass.
[377:58.58]He do got some big cheeks.
[378:00.62]Like big bulbous.
[378:08.98]Oh god damn it man.
[378:19.37]I haven't had a loaded gun in 30 to 40 straight seconds.
[378:24.89]I'm doing my, am I supposed to do something up here?
[378:27.33]I think we just have to do this.
[378:28.69]Wait, oh, there's a whole level up here.
[378:30.77]Why have the zombies not even been attacking me?
[378:33.39]Defeat mutant Derek.
[378:35.59]Alright, good luck down there.
[378:41.67]Ow!
[378:44.24]Who the fuck is, I thought there was just a random citizen up here.
[378:47.82]These zombies are actually totally innocent.
[378:53.98]Oh, this is my opportunity.
[378:55.08]Get up.
[379:03.13]I'm shooting body shots because I don't know where to shoot them from down here.
[379:08.77]Dude, having the dodge roll will you stay on the ground?
[379:11.25]I'm not so sure if that's a good idea.
[379:16.82]Get the fuck up.
[379:19.47]Alright, come on!
[379:20.87]Is this zombie even hostile?
[379:22.23]Okay.
[379:23.07]Come on!
[379:23.57]You can do that the whole time?
[379:26.37]Knock him down!
[379:27.09]What the fuck?
[379:27.51]I just learned the primary mechanic in the game.
[379:42.62]Please, get us out of here.
[379:45.24]You having fun down there?
[379:46.77]No.
[379:47.03]Zero.
[379:48.37]Am I supposed to do something?
[379:49.69]What am I supposed to do?
[379:55.51]I'm gonna fucking die.
[379:56.79]Did we finally do it?
[380:00.44]You're just in the window.
[380:11.78]I'll pass.
[380:19.38]Okay.
[380:23.85]She had to get into the cutscene spawn.
[380:31.07]He only fell from like a hundred feet.
[380:39.85]It was locked until you got to zero health.
[380:42.14]Is that really what that was?
[380:48.87]I was so far away from all that that I had no effect on that fight.
[380:56.05]Why are you helping us?
[380:57.61]The T-Rex brought this a full letter grade up, but the rest of this brought it three letter grades down.
[381:02.40]Wish I could stay longer, but I've got to run.
[381:05.38]I've left you a little parting gift on the roof.
[381:08.80]See you down the road, Leon.
[381:12.68]Ada!
[381:16.55]What are you waiting for?
[381:18.94]Shoot her.
[381:22.66]No.
[381:23.82]We're sticking together.
[381:27.63]Aw, Leon, how sweet.
[381:30.29]How much more is there to do?
[381:32.81]I feel like we've killed the same boss three times.
[381:37.45]Like, we keep killing these two guys.
[381:41.56]The guy on all fours and the T-Rex.
[381:43.92]Yeah, she texted you, so you would have her number.
[381:45.80]That's right.
[381:58.30]Yes, we see the helicopter.
[381:59.46]That means the end is in sight.
[382:01.00]Let's just pretend to be a zombie.
[382:03.70]Just walking dead.
[382:04.69]Alright, here we go.
[382:08.77]Is this the puppet master zombie?
[382:11.53]Is it the lady?
[382:12.13]What's her name?
[382:23.98]It's this guy again.
[382:27.57]Are you gonna do the other playthroughs?
[382:38.67]Are we gonna do the other playthroughs?
[382:39.99]No, I'm going to burn the copy of my CD.
[382:41.45]I have no health.
[382:43.07]I'm like dead.
[382:58.02]Hold on.
[382:58.40]Can I heal you?
[382:58.92]Let's do something about it.
[383:01.56]Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye, aye.
[383:03.14]I got it.
[383:03.46]I'm good.
[383:04.58]Nice.
[383:06.78]What do we have to shoot here?
[383:08.12]I think it's just him.
[383:09.74]I think.
[383:13.02]Deagle's pretty good.
[383:15.46]Now he's gonna... What?
[383:21.40]Now, go!
[383:23.66]Deus Ex zombies saved us this time.
[383:26.53]Well, now he comes back again.
[383:28.15]We have to be in the helicopter for him to spawn though.
[383:30.91]Yeah, we're going to get in the helicopter.
[383:37.74]He's going to jump at us or like learn to fly even.
[383:41.36]Yep.
[383:42.02]He's going to jump up.
[383:43.04]He's going to grab the helicopter with a tendril.
[383:46.10]And then we are going to have to shoot him with the rocket launcher.
[383:49.89]It's a good time to reload every gun.
[383:51.51]Yes, that's what I am doing that right now.
[384:01.51]You guys should play the Jake campaign.
[384:03.01]I'd rather eat a ghost pepper.
[384:16.36]Oh, more stuff.
[384:24.53]That was actually like five deagle rounds.
[384:27.66]I feel like we should have had more opportunity to upgrade our character or something.
[384:31.16]Not between chapters.
[384:32.04]That's, eh, lame.
[384:39.57]Co-op moment.
[384:43.69]Eating a ghost pepper, not clickbait.
[384:46.11]He turned into a fly.
[384:48.35]Did you see that?
[384:51.01]Hold on, we got one more, like, separated.
[384:53.29]I'm alright.
[384:55.77]Just get me out of here.
[384:58.08]I'm just like shooting at this guy.
[385:16.01]This boss sucks.
[385:18.39]This is so stupid.
[385:19.21]I'm just shooting this big fly in the face.
[385:29.67]I think I'm winning.
[385:37.51]Did I do something?
[385:38.95]You moved it.
[385:46.68]I'm far enough away from King Kong.
[385:50.24]This is not scary.
[385:51.20]I'm far enough away from him now.
[385:54.55]I'm not in any danger.
[385:55.37]He's one of the haunted house workers.
[385:59.69]He can't touch you.
[386:00.45]Oh, he's moving.
[386:04.70]What is happening?
[386:07.24]He's gotten angry.
[386:08.56]Oh, I have to move this again.
[386:12.18]I'm out of ammo and a lot of weapons.
[386:14.76]I have no bullets.
[386:15.52]Alright, just hang in there.
[386:22.13]I'll be with you.
[386:28.65]Do I have any bullets in any gun?
[386:31.15]No.
[386:32.35]I have nothing.
[386:34.25]I have a knife.
[386:36.15]I don't know what I'm doing.
[386:37.19]I'm playing like a game show over here.
[386:39.21]I don't think it matters.
[386:47.62]He can't hurt me.
[386:54.59]Are you dead?
[386:56.05]Uh.
[387:01.51]I feel like something was wrong there.
[387:03.75]I used every weapon.
[387:04.39]Can you move me faster?
[387:05.67]I used every bullet I had.
[387:07.45]I'm not even going to shoot at him.
[387:08.35]What a waste.
[387:32.67]I could definitely jump to you if I wanted to.
[387:36.37]He just got like a pog.
[387:37.25]He's like... I'm not going to do anything.
[387:44.84]Alright, there's like four zombies.
[387:48.68]I got to kill the zombies.
[387:51.40]Move them over somewhere.
[387:52.94]Alright, you moving?
[387:58.47]okay this is where he jumps now over that was pretty good shot I can't activate it again yet alright here he comes he's coming over to the uh lift thing there he is alright now I can do it again working on it
[388:27.30]Hold on.
[388:27.62]You have to wait.
[388:29.74]I got at least 10 seconds.
[388:31.44]Okay.
[388:40.81]Got it.
[388:41.09]Okay.
[388:42.77]Are you moving me?
[388:44.13]Yeah.
[388:44.41]Am I moving?
[388:52.08]It has to reset.
[388:53.52]There's like a timer.
[388:56.71]Okay, I'm out of bullets again.
[388:59.21]Looks like he's... Can I leave?
[389:04.61]Oh, shit.
[389:06.49]Alright, give me up.
[389:07.07]Okay.
[389:25.80]Oh, there's a lot of shit up here.
[389:28.16]Yeah.
[389:28.48]Okay.
[389:28.70]So I've been pushing buttons on this little device.
[389:32.85]Okay.
[389:33.13]So now where do we go?
[389:33.87]We have to go through this.
[389:34.67]Okay.
[389:43.49]This is bad.
[389:46.39]We got to get to the helicopter.
[389:49.81]Flies are so fucking ugly.
[389:51.27]I hope they all die.
[389:53.35]Who?
[389:54.36]Somebody said that they think flies are ugly and they should all die.
[389:56.88]I'd be okay with that.
[390:01.32]Don't flies actually do something very important, like decomposition and stuff?
[390:05.67]I'm sure the whole ecosystem does, but, like, that assumes that I'm willing to spare the ecosystem.
[390:10.47]Alright, you've gotten to a bigger fly.
[390:14.21]And I would rather delete all, like, ants, flies, and wasps.
[390:18.59]Alright, so, time to fight.
[390:29.38]Where should we shoot him?
[390:30.16]Shoot the legs?
[390:32.49]Shoot his arms?
[390:37.57]Yeah, I don't know.
[390:38.07]His legs?
[390:38.81]His belly?
[390:40.67]He's protecting his eyes, so we have to make him un- And then shoot him in the eyes when possible.
[390:55.02]Alright.
[390:55.96]What else is left to shoot?
[391:00.49]He just peekabooed and I shot it.
[391:01.87]He just peekabooed, yeah.
[391:05.05]What?
[391:07.01]Okay, he... Zeus.
[391:11.25]Oh, Zeus, thank you.
[391:14.49]You were right.
[391:16.51]The lightning rod.
[391:19.14]In the head.
[391:29.42]Got some sniper bullets in there.
[391:30.72]Alright, I'm going to take out the adds.
[391:32.68]Yeah, we need ammo.
[391:33.38]He absorbs one zombie and his eyes get... Oh my god.
[391:44.92]What's it going to take to finish this?
[391:48.10]There's some ammo back here.
[391:49.12]Yeah, this crates.
[391:54.03]This is not the time for points.
[391:55.33]I want bullets.
[392:01.14]Oh, shit.
[392:01.66]Wait, we can touch this.
[392:05.19]What did I... Okay, I just stabbed this guy?
[392:07.01]Oh, he has to eat it.
[392:08.53]We're trying to make him eat the lightning bolt so he gets electrocuted.
[392:12.35]Um... So, this guy's stabbed?
[392:16.22]How do we move this guy now?
[392:17.10]Can I move him?
[392:18.02]Can I kick him?
[392:18.44]Nah, we just have to keep doing damage to his, like, body.
[392:21.78]Do the yellow orbs and then shoot him in the face when he falls down.
[392:29.22]We're shooting his legs off or something.
[392:32.69]Need ammo.
[392:38.72]Okay, here he goes.
[392:40.82]This guy's been lightning-ified.
[392:41.86]Now what?
[392:44.78]Shoot him in the eyes.
[392:45.70]Alright.
[392:46.99]Send it!
[392:47.27]Send it!
[392:47.47]He's gonna grab it.
[393:06.48]Ow, Zeus, activate the power!
[393:27.25]Oh my god, it's still going.
[393:29.27]I can't believe that, like, that callback actually is potentially what took down the final boss.
[393:35.15]It just won't s- It won't stop.
[393:42.15]Okay, at least we have a checkpoint.
[393:48.40]No.
[393:50.88]Alright, here we are.
[393:52.60]We made it.
[393:55.80]Oh!
[393:56.24]There it is.
[393:57.56]There it is.
[394:01.77]The bazooka, the RPG.
[394:07.08]This better be a good explosion.
[394:10.14]Do we both take the shot?
[394:11.56]Or do I fly and do you shoot, I wonder?
[394:22.90]Oh, you got up.
[394:24.22]We both got up.
[394:26.12]I just... I shot him.
[394:27.10]I just picked it up.
[394:31.35]That fall over.
[394:32.65]It was a guy in a costume.
[394:35.31]One RPG.
[394:39.53]That was not what I thought.
[394:41.63]Alright.
[394:42.48]I thought we were going to fly the chopper.
[394:46.24]Yeah.
[394:49.40]Yeah.
[394:52.70]I love this scene in Simon.
[394:56.51]Vitality.
[394:59.57]Not zombie movie.
[395:00.35]The other one.
[395:01.09]Hot fuzz.
[395:02.84]probably not over like you said he's gonna grab the helicopter we're gonna have to do something else yes but that one was made of dragon glass okay that's gonna make the umbrella symbol isn't it lightning couldn't kill him but an RPG could that exactly what they wanted to have happen
[395:32.61]That guy's not ancient.
[395:33.15]He was like born in like 1975 or something.
[395:35.80]You still have a shot?
[396:00.16]It's because I didn't even get to shoot the final boss with the RPG.
[396:02.88]I had to do something.
[396:07.71]It's going to put us all the way back, isn't it?
[396:12.91]I think you just fucked us.
[396:18.43]I think you just fucked us over.
[396:21.45]We have to watch that again.
[396:24.77]Alright, at the same time now.
[396:27.43]At the same time now.
[396:30.00]I think we can skip cutscenes.
[396:34.68]Can you escape?
[396:35.98]Oh my god, dude.
[396:37.00]We were out of it.
[396:37.74]We were done.
[396:38.24]Just time it at the same time.
[396:39.74]3, 2, 1, shoot it.
[396:41.82]Okay, no, no.
[396:44.08]We both do it at the same time.
[396:46.38]Pick it up.
[396:47.34]Are you ready?
[396:47.78]Get in the spot.
[396:48.46]1, 2, 3.
[396:55.02]okay good now escape we can skip this alright we're good alright let's get out of here don't you I know you shot yours so yep I shot mine this time it actually remembers that may have been my only chance to shoot the RPG in the whole game it probably was oh I thought this was a smoke detector
[397:29.78]The data.
[397:31.62]You have to get the data.
[397:34.96]Intel.
[397:37.01]The reports.
[397:38.53]We're going to break this case wide open.
[397:40.23]We already know what happened, though.
[397:41.01]Now we can make it public.
[397:42.25]We already know what happened.
[397:43.05]We have to clear Leon's name because everyone thinks that you killed the president.
[397:47.69]Exactly.
[397:48.41]Oh, shit.
[397:48.83]That's right.
[397:49.19]You're right.
[397:49.47]You got it.
[397:49.93]Oh, that's it.
[398:01.14]Alright, I have a new game for us to play.
[398:03.70]Okay.
[398:06.28]After this is over, who can uninstall this game faster?
[398:09.08]Oh.
[398:11.56]Don't worry.
[398:12.44]This is going to be the new yearly Halloween co-op.
[398:15.70]We got three more years because there's three more campaigns.
[398:18.78]I'm not playing this ever again.
[398:19.56]Alright, how about this?
[398:22.91]You play and I'll eat a ghost pepper on your screen.
[398:25.11]And then I'll just leave.
[398:29.43]Who said that this one's even over?
[398:30.74]What if it comes back?
[398:39.14]All this shit talking.
[398:40.68]It actually wasn't that bad.
[398:42.68]It was bad, but it was awful.
[398:45.07]But it wasn't awful enough to not play.
[398:50.99]Let's be honest, it was not good.
[398:52.99]But it was not... If you have a friend, you can just laugh through it like we just did.
[399:02.48]Alright.
[399:05.38]Stay for the after credits scene.
[399:14.35]Player has left the game.
[399:16.69]Uninstalled, I win.
[399:21.31]Got it.
[399:24.66]Nice.
[399:25.28]I'm honestly shocked that it didn't, like, yank me back to the... Did you force quit it?
[399:30.22]Because I can't even hit escape on this menu.
[399:34.29]I just literally alt-tabbed and just force quit it.
[399:37.91]Wow.
[399:38.39]Okay.
[399:38.81]The game's now uninstalled.
[399:40.69]Wow.
[399:42.01]Alright.
[399:42.73]Nice.
[399:44.29]Okay.
[399:44.51]How much of that is related to me, like, throwing a bomb on you?
[399:48.85]And how much of it is just the game?
[399:50.94]Well, I just figured that it would be a funny thing to who can uninstall it faster.
[400:00.33]Now delete the banana gif.
[400:02.19]I didn't upload it.
[400:04.29]I watched it and laughed at it.
[400:06.21]I still have a Google image for Chris Redfield with a banana open.
[400:11.59]I don't want to see it.
[400:18.35]Alright.
[400:19.81]That's it.
[400:21.07]That was fun.
[400:22.07]That was Resident Evil 6, and it was a fun game, and we played it.
[400:25.69]It was fun, yeah.
[400:28.93]And we're going to play the next three chapters on a stream near you.
[400:35.71]Trevor just didn't want to see his final score.
[400:37.77]Probably true.
[400:38.43]Oh, wait, did you see it?
[400:39.11]Did you actually see the final score?
[400:40.15]No, I quit, too.
[400:41.99]I didn't want to be left behind.
[400:45.20]Ugh.
[400:49.99]How long has the stream been?
[400:51.65]Six hours and 40 minutes.
[400:53.07]Probably like an hour of that was just the one outside the house segment.
[400:58.67]I forgot that we started at 3.30.
[401:00.35]In my brain, this started at 2, but no, we started at 3.30.
[401:03.73]Pretty cool.
[401:07.40]Well, I hope you guys enjoyed that.
[401:08.46]I hope it was fun.
[401:10.00]I actually had a great time.
[401:11.14]Regardless if the game was bad, it was fun to do.
[401:14.90]Is that supposed to be the best campaign?
[401:17.02]Is that the best one in the game?
[401:18.60]That's the main campaign, from what I understand.
[401:21.08]Because, look, you saw, like, Ada.
[401:23.42]You're going to, oh, Ada's across the bridge.
[401:25.26]She's fighting the monster.
[401:26.18]I think you just do their version.
[401:31.13]Yeah, because you see them.
[401:32.81]That's them in a boss fight, like, later when you play that campaign.
[401:36.51]And I'm sure you'll turn around as Ada.
[401:38.53]You'll look over your shoulder.
[401:39.85]You'll turn.
[401:40.21]You'll see, oh, there they are.
[401:41.45]There's the other two players.
[401:42.67]There's Leon and, yeah.
[401:50.63]That was a good story moment.
[401:51.87]Wait, you said the game was bad and you lost 500 viewers.
[401:54.03]What are you talking about?
[401:54.89]No, I did not say that.
[401:55.97]Oh, you're talking about right now?
[402:00.29]No, people are leaving because the stream is ending.
[402:04.74]Yeah, there's not going to be another six and a half hour campaign right now.
[402:10.20]It's over.
[402:11.48]Okay, I see what you mean.
[402:14.77]Alright, well, I think that's going to be it.
[402:19.09]Thanks, Etalyx, for playing.
[402:20.01]It's always a pleasure.
[402:21.35]It was very fun.
[402:23.51]And we'll see you soon.
[402:27.08]I will indeed.
[402:27.70]Thank you, the Jermamites, for having me.
[402:33.36]You know where to find Etalyx.
[402:34.88]If you don't, you will in a second.
[402:35.86]I hope you're keeping an active tally of all my plus twos.
[402:40.47]But yeah, that was fun.
[402:41.81]And we'll see you again.
[402:42.45]Thanks for playing, dude.
[402:44.63]It was a good time.
[402:45.79]Thanks, everybody.
[402:46.59]Bye.
[402:47.89]Yeah.
[402:48.65]Take care.
[402:52.53]Alright.
[402:54.39]So where does that leave us?
[402:57.48]The plan here is on Wednesday, the Monster Rancher, they're not remakes and they're not remasters, so I'm not going to call them that.
[403:09.68]They're reports.
[403:12.25]They're ports.
[403:14.05]I'm going to play at least Monster Rancher 2.
[403:17.29]I'm trying to think if I should do them both, but I don't think so.
[403:19.17]I think we're just going to do 2.
[403:20.05]Because 2 is the best one.
[403:26.91]So, we'll play Monster Rancher 2.
[403:30.19]Get back into it.
[403:31.89]And then on Thursday is the Game Awards.
[403:35.91]So I'm going to stream the Game Awards, and depending on how long the Game Awards is, we'll probably just go back to Monster Rancher 2 again.
[403:46.14]And then from there, that will be Thursday.
[403:51.12]After that, I really want to get the baby sensory, you laugh, you lose, kind of just chatting stream ready.
[403:58.08]So that'll probably be somewhere early in the next week.
[404:03.76]I can't believe you're doing it.
[404:04.74]I mean, I'm going to do it.
[404:12.50]So this is a chill week.
[404:14.58]I don't think so.
[404:16.76]Maybe the Monster Rancher streams will be lower energy.
[404:19.75]We'll see.
[404:20.39]I say that, but it always ends up being the opposite.
[404:25.65]Hope you had a good time.
[404:26.43]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[404:28.47]We are out.
[404:31.07]I'll see you guys on Wednesday for Monster Rancher.
[404:35.54]If you have never seen Monster Rancher, it is very good.
[404:38.80]There's a lot of pog moments, for sure.
[404:51.03]And we will go... Okay.
[404:58.61]Why can't I hear myself?
[404:59.39]Oh, there we go.
[405:03.38]Alright.
[405:04.28]See you later, everybody.
[405:05.92]Good night.
[405:06.94]Goodbye.
[405:07.36]Have a great rest of your evening.
[405:13.23]We'll see you Wednesday.
[405:16.95]Take care of yourselves.
[405:18.69]Good night.
[406:02.80]Thank you.
[406:37.66]you
