[ve:60.16.100]

[00:11.85]I am downloading it right now.
[00:12.93]I got to ask unmute.
[00:17.28]Is this a WASD game or is this a controller game?
[00:25.32]Okay.
[00:27.69]Move my controller out of the way.
[00:39.32]It could be a loud game.
[00:45.35]Alright.
[00:50.73]I have it installed.
[00:51.75]Let's do it.
[00:53.03]Play Golf It.
[01:14.13]It is kind of a loud game just to make sure you understand.
[01:23.74]How do you play?
[01:25.32]You just hit the ball when you golf?
[01:27.96]Yeah, I was golf work.
[01:30.64]You don't have golf works.
[01:31.82]I always see people at the club.
[01:38.57]Yes.
[01:42.58]I think it should be illegal to have your game be loud on launch.
[01:49.25]Illegal?
[01:50.53]I don't know.
[01:51.13]Just like removed off Steam.
[01:53.51]I feel like there needs to be a gamer gulag.
[01:58.89]I'm just traumatized even talking about it.
[02:00.75]That fucking Devil May Cry thing.
[02:02.13]I don't understand.
[02:05.27]Oh, there's skins.
[02:05.71]Hold on.
[02:11.24]What do you, what is it?
[02:13.90]Part of me thinks, I shouldn't even say this, but part of me thinks that you, you thought of that idea and like, that's the reason why you played Devil May Cry and just waited like hours until that moment to press the sound.
[02:26.47]That would have been hilarious.
[02:27.91]That would have been like, what a plan, but no, no plan for me.
[02:30.35]Part of me thinks you didn't even want to play Devil May Cry and you just wanted to play the sound.
[02:35.44]Hey Jerma, fix your audio.
[02:37.08]Fix my audio?
[02:37.78]What's wrong with it?
[02:40.44]What's wrong with it?

[03:16.39]Jerma?

[03:17.89]I feel like we've done it before.
[03:19.63]If not, then Ster Ster does.
[03:30.30]There's a little quiet.
[03:31.00]Yeah, I'm gonna turn everybody up in a second.

[04:19.31]With a slice of American cheese?
[04:20.53]Should I put on collision mode?
[04:26.23]Yeah.
[04:26.99]How does this game even work?
[04:29.03]That's a good question.
[04:29.97]There's no, like, room code I can show, right?
[04:32.19]We're just good.
[04:34.77]We're just good, honestly.

[05:14.68]Alright, so you hold left click.
[05:16.26]Yeah, Poe, can you give us like a tiny tutorial?
[05:18.32]Alright, so you want to aim where you want to, you know, shoot the ball.
[05:21.74]Yep.
[05:22.24]And then you left click, and then you move your mouse back, like in real life, like a golf club.
[05:28.49]And then you hit up.
[05:30.01]Oh, you just went.
[05:32.09]Okay.

[06:35.72]Oh, you've played this game before.
[06:38.63]How would you know it's good?
[06:39.99]It's just...

[07:28.04]But they can't.
[07:29.34]Alright, this one goes all the way up.
[07:37.30]This one does go up.
[07:40.56]Oh, sorry, really?
[07:45.20]almost oh okay that was way too hard no you hit my ball oh oh my alright at what point do I just do the thing where I just drag it up and drag it in
[08:14.73]This one is not how golf works.
[08:19.25]I got it.
[08:23.14]I was so timid with that and it's annoying.
[08:25.12]Oh my gosh, what am I doing?
[08:28.74]Oh my goodness gracious.
[08:31.60]We're going to get in trouble because we're so bad they're going to think we're doing this shit on purpose.
[08:35.77]In what real life scenario do you need to golf this way?
[08:38.53]How is this helping me?
[08:41.69]How is this helping my game?
[08:46.81]um it's about precision it's a precision simulator I already scored I don't know what's going on with you guys Ster you're on like stroke 30. I don't want to talk about it I don't know how I'm this bad I'm telling you like this game
[09:16.16]You're the guy that complains about minigolf at minigolf.
[09:20.77]I'm just saying, in a real-life golf scenario, when do you have to operate at these angles?
[09:26.31]How is this preparing me for adulthood?
[09:28.59]I didn't even get to finish.
[09:31.84]It actually didn't let you finish.
[09:33.90]Oh!
[09:36.40]Oh, no!
[09:37.74]Damn it!
[09:39.10]Oh, yeah, actually, it went in.
[09:40.44]Two back-to-backs.
[09:46.45]I started off so strong on the real golf courses.
[09:51.43]And then we're doing this Looney Tunes shit now.
[09:57.57]Ster, are you also the same kind of person that gets irrationally angry at bowling as well?
[10:03.96]Uh, nah, because bowling doesn't matter.
[10:07.70]Oh, you know, like, oh, this is my third time coming up here and I hit two pins again.
[10:12.58]I'm fucking furious and I don't want to be here anymore.
[10:17.14]no oh it goes across that's tricky do you guys hear the music too yeah I turned it down it's trying to be crazy where does this go what what can we is it like a map view yeah can we get a mini map oh you can scroll out there's a butter I think piss
[10:47.16]V you press V kind of get into the different one oh just a smashing good time playing golf with the lads just hanging out got you
[11:14.55]That's going to be good enough.
[11:15.51]Hey, I made it.
[11:18.98]So what coffee do you drink that makes you feel better than other people?
[11:21.58]What coffee do I drink?
[11:22.98]Is it a question for me or for Pogue?
[11:25.04]No, for you, because you're the coffee guy.
[11:28.40]If you want to feel distinguished and better than everyone, as you often do, what do you go for?
[11:36.38]Any kind of drink.
[11:38.90]There's a lot of mugs in your house, by the way.
[11:42.22]Yeah, you put hot liquid into the mug.
[11:45.92]How many mugs do you have?
[11:48.85]Two.
[11:49.95]Poke, how many mugs do you have?
[11:52.39]Five.
[11:53.05]Okay, thank you.
[11:56.55]Because I don't want the chat to be like, same mug from the other day.
[12:02.10]Right.
[12:02.38]You know?
[12:03.00]They get really weird about it.
[12:06.52]Like, same... Same mug.
[12:08.64]I use the same mug back to back.
[12:10.46]I feel like that's the responsible thing to do.
[12:12.16]If they have a problem with it, then they can, you know, just wash their dishes every day and destroy the environment.
[12:17.46]Do you have any fun mugs, Poe?
[12:19.06]Because, I mean, there's practical and then there's fun.
[12:21.00]I have a lot of very funny mugs.
[12:22.49]I'll show you.
[12:23.15]Yeah.
[12:24.11]I have, like, one mug that makes me laugh, like, really hard.
[12:28.17]It's not about all the functions, Ster.
[12:29.71]It's about, you know, sometimes you want, like, a funny, goofy mug.
[12:36.55]I have one mug of summit 1g it's good I don't know that's one of them make it it's not the funny one I don't have any funny mugs I have a pure white mug plain vanilla and I have a black one with a wood handle
[12:58.12]That's okay.
[12:58.80]They are polar opposite mugs.
[13:01.62]You know what?
[13:03.22]You know where the fun comes in?
[13:04.28]Where?
[13:04.76]You want to know where the fun is?
[13:07.10]I only have been using them for hot chocolate.
[13:11.17]That's fine.
[13:11.57]It's a hot beverage.
[13:12.49]What's wrong with that?
[13:13.41]Okay, yeah, but that's what I mean.
[13:14.31]This hot chocolate kind of, you know, like makes you, portrays you as someone, a man of the people.
[13:21.15]But if you're, what are you drinking?
[13:23.33]I drink everything.
[13:24.03]Espresso?
[13:24.47]Out of your own espresso?
[13:25.91]You're not a man of the people anymore, Jerma.
[13:29.05]Why not?
[13:29.97]If you drink espresso, you're no longer a man of the people?
[13:33.73]What does that mean?
[13:36.33]It means that you don't care about the working man anymore.
[13:44.06]Do you guys not get anxiety from coffee?
[13:47.06]I don't drink coffee.
[13:48.16]I'm not a coffer.
[13:52.79]Starbucks coffee, I feel like that's illegal.
[13:55.29]It's just way too strong.
[13:58.72]Yeah.
[14:00.97]Coffee is... I kind of just want something in my hands, if I'm honest.
[14:06.53]I just need something to sip on.
[14:07.97]Got ya.
[14:08.73]Blocked.
[14:09.93]That is way further than I thought it was.
[14:13.57]I'll remember the Ster.
[14:15.24]Ster hates normal people.
[14:17.30]What?
[14:19.54]That's not true.
[14:22.64]I drink a lot of tea.
[14:23.84]I drink a lot of coffee.
[14:25.10]I drink hot chocolate.
[14:26.92]I drink hot chocolate too.
[14:32.06]That's not going to actually.
[14:33.00]OK.
[14:35.66]Wait, score from there.
[14:38.06]Oh shit, can I?
[14:39.24]Oh, you're genius.
[14:45.56]Uh, but I drink tea.
[14:56.44]I drink coffee.
[14:57.04]I drink hot chocolate.
[14:58.02]I drink pretty much anything hot.
[15:00.12]Pick a side.
[15:01.53]They're all good.
[15:02.33]Have you ever had like a good hot tea?
[15:07.79]Yes, you have.
[15:11.23]You've had tea before.
[15:12.68]I can't help it.
[15:13.62]My brain is wired fucking wrong.
[15:18.24]Okay.
[15:31.21]You like tea, though.
[15:32.07]I've seen you drink it before.
[15:34.15]Yeah, I do.
[15:39.63]That could be a hole in one right there.
[15:42.77]Oh.
[15:46.04]Oh, come on.
[15:47.56]Your dentures just fell out mid-sentence.
[15:49.42]I don't even know who's winning.
[15:57.32]Oh, bro, you got so much height.
[16:00.09]I'm going to go as high as I can on this one.
[16:01.75]Do it as hard as you can.
[16:05.41]That was weak.
[16:07.20]That was actually kind of weak.
[16:08.24]Okay, okay.
[16:10.30]Oh, shit.
[16:13.04]See you in the next course.
[16:13.98]Hold on.
[16:14.54]Next one.
[16:20.93]Can you dunk it in like that?
[16:23.75]You probably can.
[16:24.27]I did it.
[16:24.79]I just did it and it...
[16:26.68]popped out uh can we just skip this one like say that well you have one minute before it um Luigi's you okay okay oh god that was too hard you're hitting it way too hard you gotta pull back by at least 80% dude oh you did it same thing happened to me
[16:59.01]I'm so sorry.
[16:59.81]I let all the Sturmanites down.
[17:05.28]Oh, the bounce saved me.
[17:07.76]Nice.
[17:08.04]I started to Ster.
[17:08.60]Are you okay?
[17:28.08]There we go.
[17:29.30]Boom.
[17:30.06]Bogey.
[17:32.57]Alright, what does this one do?
[17:35.05]What does this one do?
[17:36.27]You gotta go.
[17:37.27]You gotta go fast.
[17:39.61]Yeah.
[17:40.63]Oh, that's a little too fast.
[17:47.28]Oops.
[17:49.08]I'm gonna try some crazy nonsense.
[17:54.10]Sorry.
[17:59.23]Thought this was supposed to be a fun game.
[18:00.57]Alright, this is chill.
[18:02.05]I like it a lot.
[18:04.65]Oh, fuck.
[18:06.55]I'm blasting it.
[18:07.43]I am absolutely blasting this one.
[18:09.37]Okay, that doesn't work that way.
[18:18.42]There we go.
[18:20.82]Poke, are you waiting for us?
[18:22.62]Yeah.
[18:23.36]That's so kind of you.
[18:24.64]I'm just chillin'.
[18:29.84]oh nice shot that's a home run is this is this the last one yeah this one uh you're gonna either hate it or one shot it oh I see oh wait so you've played this before and you're cheating yeah a bunch of times
[18:58.02]So if you win, isn't that like not fair?
[19:00.46]I'm last place right now.
[19:02.28]Is it Tabsy?
[19:03.33]I'm trying.
[19:06.85]Dude, I'm in first place.
[19:11.53]I feel like you kind of left out what you're drinking out of those mugs.
[19:15.55]Water.
[19:20.96]Oh, god damn it.
[19:23.50]I don't like that answer.
[19:31.92]Iron numbers aren't better in golf.
[19:35.20]Yeah, look at Ster.
[19:36.44]Holy shit, dude.
[19:43.96]I don't drink tea.
[19:44.54]I just drink hot water.
[19:48.03]Okay, as long as it's hot.
[19:49.21]Because I feel like if you're putting something in a mug and it's not hot, it's a little weird.
[19:51.95]Why does nobody drink hot water ever?
[19:53.47]I feel like hot water would make me go to the bathroom.
[19:57.37]I drink hot water you do yeah what no like just just hot water by itself I do it when I'm in the shower and I also sometimes I do it before streams wait if my throat's all okay but so you drink tea so why don't you just put tea in there for like a little for like a little buff also for a little buff yeah it's like it doesn't have like oh my god listen I'm a man of the people
[20:26.77]You're going to beat me, Ster.
[20:27.85]I'm going to hit this like 30 more times.
[20:33.19]Thank God.
[20:35.31]Well, that was just the warm-up, so we all know it didn't count.
[20:39.73]And obviously the person who's played this before won.
[20:42.58]I cheated.
[20:43.02]They've got like cosmetics on their ball and stuff.
[20:49.28]Keep your head up, King.
[20:52.08]Thanks.
[20:56.99]uh yeah you don't drink the shower water no I put it I get it in my mouth and I swish it around and spit it out it's not good enough to swallow so you just sit under there and just like I don't get it it's it's honestly as much water as you could drink it's basically infinite you're just giving it out okay
[21:28.81]Oh my god.
[21:30.97]No, no, seriously.
[21:32.37]There's so much bacteria in there.
[21:34.87]Chat member, you're talking about him.
[21:37.61]I didn't say this.
[21:39.66]Buy a bottle of water.
[21:40.84]How much does it cost?
[21:41.82]Take a shower.
[21:47.52]I'm confused what you're saying.
[21:49.30]I'm saying that it's infinite free water in the shower.
[21:51.75]Why wouldn't I drink it?
[21:54.97]Yeah, there's infinite free water in the toilet too.
[21:57.23]You don't see you lapping that up.
[21:59.19]dogs do so you actually drink the shower water yeah what is what it's it's water okay that's not really that big of a deal I don't think but it's just it's a little that's a little odd I would say then again I have brought a nice ice cold can of coke into the shower before too
[22:27.97]To try it, or just like... That's weirder!
[22:31.47]But just because, no, but here's the thing.
[22:33.29]That's not weird.
[22:34.36]But in my mind, I said, fuck it, I don't care.
[22:36.24]Like, I'm just going for this.
[22:37.14]This is weird, I don't care.
[22:39.22]Like, that was, the mentality wasn't, this is normal.
[22:40.92]The mentality is, this is a weird, bizarre thing to do.
[22:43.54]I'm just going to do it, why not?
[22:44.58]Your fuck it moment was, I brought a cold coke into the shower.
[22:48.17]Let's get a hole-in-one, I don't have to listen to you.
[22:54.11]Literally everyone got a hole-in-one.
[22:58.47]oh did you I did oh I thought it stopped right at the goal have you ever eaten an orange in the shower I can't even say that word but also too alright when we talk about these things guys I think a lot of people get a little bit of a misrepresentation from the things we talk about because I think people take these things and go oh he drinks a can of coke in the shower every day I did this once when I was like 19.
[23:27.37]This is not a regular occurrence.
[23:28.75]This is something just strange that happened one day.
[23:30.61]Yeah.
[23:40.67]Grown ass man.
[23:46.52]Shower beers?
[23:47.34]I can see it.
[23:51.42]People like drinking like cold drinks in the hot shower.
[23:53.78]I've heard it's like a thing, you know?
[23:57.41]I've read that before.
[23:58.45]Get in there.
[24:00.63]Oh, wait.
[24:01.13]Nobody's going to come close to how good that was.
[24:06.11]Poke, maybe you will.
[24:08.13]Damn, he got it.
[24:09.75]Nice.
[24:10.97]Yo, is this the ghost one?
[24:12.50]Are there ghosts in here?

[24:20.10]I didn't mean to.
[24:21.12]I'm not going until you guys are both gone.
[24:23.16]I'm not going until you're gone.
[24:24.10]I'm not going to go.
[24:30.03]Now we both can't have any fun.
[24:31.83]I'm right.
[24:32.45]I'm right next to it.
[24:35.01]You hit me like I was nearly a hole in one.
[24:41.80]You told me to do it slow.
[24:55.00]You guys ever like go in the shower and and wash your feet?
[25:00.38]Uh, yeah.
[25:05.54]Okay.
[25:07.27]Am I stuck here?

[25:11.03]Yeah, what's going on here?
[25:11.89]Holy fucking shit.
[25:16.81]Alright.
[25:18.37]I think I'm going to make up some ground on that one.
[25:27.37]That might have just sealed the game.
[25:30.77]What just happened?
[25:32.47]You gotta, you gotta hit these wedges or something.
[25:36.11]You have to just like get lucky.
[25:42.07]Nah.

[25:54.57]Keep trying.
[26:02.81]Oh, that's annoying.
[26:08.23]If you're in the white line, it should count.
[26:11.57]Yeah.
[26:13.65]Dude, I know how they can make the zoomers care about golf.
[26:17.03]Make the hole three times as big and have the ball be fucking like two times as big.
[26:22.58]Like swollen?
[26:25.22]Swollen?
[26:26.42]I think they should put instead of like sand.
[26:29.50]Oh, there's sand on this field.
[26:30.78]There should be clowns.
[26:35.35]just be with a beach ball and make the course you got a hole in one is there why hit the bucket hit the bucket oh does that not count oh doesn't
[26:53.19]oh Ster really you can't hit the bucket Ster wow I can I'm just holding like you knew the bucket was there before you even I didn't actually I just got I really didn't I don't remember anything bounce up there I'm stuck I hit the bucket do anything oh the bucket is a win I thought okay
[27:20.91]Guys, I'm glitching out.
[27:21.93]Oh, he stinks at this.
[27:24.55]Are you left clicking?
[27:25.89]No.
[27:26.11]Is there like a reset?
[27:31.01]Yeah, R. Check out this bucket shot.
[27:41.71]Check out this bucket shot.
[27:43.73]It actually is deceivingly hard to hit.
[27:52.90]check out this bucket shot Ster is suffering ha ha ha ha ha you've got a hater over here that is so happy to see this eat that haters oh slurp on that one you got it it's water coming out of a shower head back to turn I have to time that person out now
[28:18.13]That's somehow the worst possible thing that could have happened.
[28:24.30]Oh great.
[28:28.66]So you guys are just going to be both white?
[28:31.50]But I have the trail on mine.
[28:33.80]Yeah, but like you can change your color.
[28:35.76]Oh, how do I do it?
[28:37.92]There's a color tab in there.
[28:45.54]I don't think we can.
[28:46.22]I don't think we can do it here.
[28:51.98]I thought the pizza was enough.
[28:55.24]Am I still ahead of you?
[28:57.00]Okay, yeah, by a lot.
[28:59.94]Man, am I bad at this?
[29:04.26]How does this one work?
[29:08.50]How would you get a hole in one on this one?
[29:10.68]Go medium speed, I think.
[29:21.35]Wait, what the fuck am I looking at here?
[29:23.89]Just wait there, sir.
[29:26.17]Nah.
[29:28.91]I don't want to get... I should have.
[29:30.29]No, you're right.
[29:32.51]What?
[29:32.97]I didn't even know that was there.
[29:34.10]Yeah, it's depth perception.
[29:39.24]We all know that you only have one third eye in the middle that can see.
[29:43.12]And the other two eyes are plants by the government.
[29:45.89]You guys can rotate a cube in your head, right?
[29:49.89]Yeah.
[29:50.69]Wait, what?
[29:51.52]Can you rotate a cube in your head?
[29:53.72]You can see it and visually it's there.
[29:55.50]The cube is rotating in your head right now.
[29:58.38]Yeah.
[30:02.32]What's a cube though?
[30:05.04]I think there's a lot of people that don't have that internal visual monolog.
[30:13.01]Which is interesting to think about because I can just see.
[30:15.01]I could watch whole movies right now if I wanted to.
[30:19.62]That sounded really braggy.
[30:21.50]And I don't mean to brag.
[30:22.80]I don't know why that sounded braggy for some reason.
[30:27.76]I could watch a whole movie right now if I wanted to.
[30:29.36]It's like, okay, settle down.
[30:33.56]In school, there was like those kids and that one kid in art class that had like a picture of perfect memory.
[30:38.50]What was it called?
[30:40.86]I think that.
[30:44.32]I don't know.
[30:45.00]Yeah, it's no, it is.
[30:45.78]It's called something.
[30:47.18]Photographic.
[30:58.37]Look at that tiny little board right there.
[30:59.91]You guys are just smashing it and getting lucky.
[31:03.51]I'm out here actually hitting it with technique.
[31:07.74]Is that why you're rolling on the right side flush with the wood?
[31:12.04]Because I don't see you scoring.
[31:17.14]Yeah, because you guys got lucky by smashing it.
[31:26.45]Let me get it.
[31:27.21]Just smashed it.
[31:28.99]Oh, Poke, you just gave me a hole in one.
[31:32.29]Hey, don't tell Star.
[31:35.01]I didn't smash it.
[31:35.77]That was calculated.
[31:43.97]Sounds interesting.
[31:46.29]Oh, this is the Trackmania Forever one.
[31:48.39]That was way too hard.
[31:58.99]Shit.
[32:04.47]Oh, please.
[32:10.71]This music is making me a little bit crazy.
[32:13.12]Boop.
[32:13.84]Boop.
[32:15.20]Making me a little bit... I don't know.
[32:27.27]Trackmania.
[32:28.47]You guys should play Trackmania, people are saying.
[32:32.13]I'm down.
[32:34.47]I've never played it.
[32:35.11]Can we just play with each other?
[32:45.28]not sure how it works I wonder how um you kind of all just race on the same map at the same time and it keeps all your scores and like whoever has the fastest time wins so kind of yeah it's like racing against ghosts but it's people have you played oh a while back either one of you played f099 no I'm too lazy to set up by switch I don't understand where this is going it's worth it in the net
[33:14.90]But why?
[33:17.43]What's my balls motivation?
[33:18.57]Alright, why is this behind us?
[33:35.18]You really you really going for that?
[33:38.26]I was hoping I could knock you off, but that is ruined everything for myself.
[33:44.66]Want to try it again?
[33:46.72]Yeah, in three, two... That's not right.
[33:53.10]They're just smashing it and getting lucky.
[33:55.82]I thought you were going to go early, so I'd miss.
[34:15.69]no no wait what it resets you all the way oh no that's way too hard wait yeah it did I think that's the next map oh that's the next way that's the next one oh my goodness oh it is okay I still didn't get it
[34:47.58]Why would they line them up like that?
[34:50.08]Who does that?
[34:50.86]It's hard.
[34:53.77]It'll offset it by a little bit.
[34:55.69]Why are they all doing the three face?
[34:57.59]Oh, shit.
[35:01.97]Can you just call them all good kittens and not say like, oh, why are you guys just saying like, oh, that's my good little kitties.
[35:15.04]Oh!
[35:16.62]Oh, you almost got me in.
[35:27.08]Come on.
[35:29.38]What's your guys favorite water?
[35:32.70]I actually just did this like a couple months ago.
[35:37.68]Really?
[35:38.36]Yeah.
[35:40.18]Me and Holly, we decided what our favorite waters were.
[35:43.37]Wait, there's a second.
[35:46.68]Goal?
[35:48.20]What's your favorite?
[35:50.46]Uh, this is gonna sound really annoying.
[35:53.95]But mine.
[35:56.93]I have a water filter.
[35:58.77]I have like a reverse osmosis filter.
[36:02.11]And it just tastes way better than anything that I bought at the store.
[36:04.69]I have a reverse osmosis filter with my cappuccino machine.
[36:08.49]I'm one of the normal people.
[36:09.71]I just drink cappuccino out of my mug.
[36:11.39]How do I get one of those things?
[36:14.16]A water filter.
[36:16.62]Oh, okay.
[36:18.94]I do a little bit of reverse osmosis with my water.
[36:22.42]I will not let that shower water touch my tongue.
[36:27.85]I do sound like that.
[36:28.79]I do.
[36:29.21]Yeah, I sound like that.
[36:29.98]You're right.
[36:35.76]Do you like ice?
[36:36.56]Like, do you have a good ice machine?
[36:38.24]I love ice.
[36:39.70]Only the finest from the Titanic.
[36:42.15]I like... Well, he's being goofy.
[36:44.95]So we're trying to have a conversation about different liquids.
[36:48.79]Yeah, sir.
[36:49.15]Do you want to join in on the liquid convo?
[36:51.35]I said my favorite water was shower.
[36:53.63]Yeah.
[36:53.99]That's not your favorite water, though.
[36:55.88]That's just the thing you do.
[37:04.58]Doesn't that correlate?
[37:11.38]I forget.
[37:13.10]Ollie, what was my favorite?
[37:15.34]I think we took a picture of like our ratings.
[37:17.98]Hey honey, honey, what's my favorite water?
[37:20.88]I know I did this.
[37:21.71]Hey sweetheart, what kind of water do I like?
[37:24.05]Man, I just don't have the touch.
[37:32.79]I have the touch of a big man and I'm playing with a bunch of little babies you told us we were smashing it and now you're what have you been doing then let me see what was it what what water was it that I liked again
[38:04.92]Hey, I'll tell you.
[38:05.48]I got a coffee machine and I got a water filter and I don't buy bottled water anymore.
[38:11.30]I don't go to fucking Starbucks twice a day.
[38:15.18]I don't have either of those things and neither do I. I have a sink.
[38:20.64]Have you seen what comes out of that?
[38:31.51]Sorry, I had you on ignore.
[38:32.63]What did you say?
[38:34.54]I said water comes out of my sink.
[38:38.26]That's the way my apartment came.
[38:40.52]They just gave it to me that way.
[38:43.76]What if they're giving you bacteria?
[38:46.46]Alright, then I'll be stronger for it.
[38:47.88]Oh, he's just smashing it.
[38:54.61]I actually just did this to make sure you saw.
[38:56.57]I'm just always smashing it.
[38:57.63]It's just working.
[39:03.46]People are begging to mute the music.

[40:33.12]I don't even know what I was trying to say.
[40:35.06]This is like a wacky fucking mad scientist writing.
[40:40.17]What?
[40:41.41]Your water list?
[40:42.31]Yeah, we made a water list and I have no idea what any of this is supposed to mean.
[40:46.43]Hold on.
[40:48.25]It wasn't even for stream.
[40:50.62]No.
[40:51.44]You just did a water list.
[40:53.42]Yeah.
[40:54.04]For fun.
[40:55.22]Yeah, for fun.
[40:59.79]How do we see this?
[41:02.01]Can you send that to me on Discord?
[41:10.98]I don't know what any of this stuff means.
[41:13.26]We were writing down like core water, smart water, water from the tap, the sink.
[41:19.82]Why?
[41:20.16]I don't know.
[41:20.80]It was fun.
[41:21.56]Wait, you don't do fun things?
[41:27.28]That's crazy.
[41:28.10]Upstream is crazy.
[41:34.65]Everything doesn't have to be... Did you tell anyone until now?
[41:37.01]No.
[41:39.03]How high were you?
[41:40.64]Not at all, actually.
[41:41.84]I just never done it before.
[41:48.03]Hold on a second.
[41:49.14]I've never done... Hey, guys.
[41:50.32]Hey, anyone in chat.
[41:50.96]Have you ever done a water list before?
[41:52.28]Have you ever done a water tier list?
[41:53.60]I better sit down and clear sound mind.
[41:57.00]Let's do a water list.
[41:57.96]Well, we sit around and do cereal tier lists and soda tier lists.
[42:02.80]I can't, in my own time, in my own dwelling, do a tier list with my girlfriend.
[42:09.11]Why not?
[42:10.33]Why does it have to be on camera?
[42:15.91]Honestly, it would be weird if it was on camera as well.
[42:19.87]But it really just is weirder that, like, that's what you do with your spare time.
[42:23.73]Okay, okay.
[42:25.75]Okay.
[42:26.19]Alright, well, I'm getting the photo.
[42:39.59]The photo is going to be delivered.
[42:46.62]Okay, I will have the photo delivered to my stream in literally probably five minutes.
[42:54.29]Alright, cool.
[42:56.11]Okay, so do you want to- Have you guys played Phasmophobia?
[42:59.95]Yeah, it's fun.
[43:01.65]That didn't sound like it was very fun to me.
[43:04.29]How about Demonologist?
[43:07.84]Demonologist?
[43:08.88]Wait, I think that's the one you were talking about.
[43:12.08]Oh.
[43:13.34]Yeah, it's like scuffed fun.
[43:14.52]It'd be fun.
[43:18.58]Yeah, I don't know which these are.
[43:19.45]I don't know if you guys are down for a horror game.
[43:24.73]Um... Ster, do you want to play horror?
[43:26.77]I think I'm probably going to call it here soon.
[43:29.23]Okay, cool.
[43:29.65]I had a lot of fun today.
[43:31.68]I want to show this.
[43:32.98]Yeah, let's talk about the water tier list.
[43:35.72]yeah let's get let's get this make sure we get this in so did you test each as you were writing it down or was it a simple it was just it was a kind of recollection it was a here we scrambled them so I think it was core water smart water um what do you mean you scrambled them it was just like we didn't know what which one we were tasting which one we were testing
[43:56.97]So it was core water, smart water, reverse osmosis, Dasani, I think.
[44:04.64]I don't know what the R is.
[44:06.58]I don't know what the E is either.
[44:08.16]I don't know what any of these mean.
[44:09.91]Okay, well, whatever.
[44:10.73]So wait, you set up, you didn't say, oh yeah, we did a tier list.
[44:14.87]You didn't say we set up a blind taste test of all different types of water.
[44:19.05]Yes, that's what we did.
[44:21.86]How'd you get the water?
[44:22.88]Did you order it?
[44:23.50]Why are you leaving these details out like everyone should have known?
[44:26.77]Hold on.
[44:27.27]Hold on.
[44:27.79]Well, I got attacked the second I brought it up.
[44:31.97]Okay.
[44:32.71]Did you make someone on Instacart order every water?
[44:36.55]Get me one each.
[44:39.43]And one yellow claw.
[44:43.04]See if I can tell.
[44:44.16]We need like a control group.
[44:47.48]Okay.

[45:12.87]I'm well, it was a long time ago.
[45:14.77]First of all, this was a very long time ago.
[45:17.67]Is it had to go that you still have the paper?
[45:20.03]I mean, well, no, this was a photo that was taken from a phone.
[45:23.04]This wasn't a paper.
[45:27.48]Okay, so let's try to go over this.
[45:32.00]It's called water.jp.
[45:33.98]What is it?
[45:38.15]How come this keeps happening?
[45:39.15]I save a photo and then it just doesn't do anything.
[45:41.59]There we go.
[45:42.27]Okay.
[45:43.13]Here it comes.
[45:45.71]Okay.
[45:47.23]I have no... I don't... This is tricky.
[45:50.73]Because... It's... Did you use blood?
[45:58.80]This is a Nordic ritual.
[46:02.38]A Nordic shamanic ritual.
[46:06.63]This is the kind of shit the aliens are going to find a million years from now.
[46:10.45]And they're going to be like, wow, what code were they writing?
[46:13.92]These ancient hieroglyphics.
[46:16.18]It's like, no, it was just some dickhead.
[46:17.50]And his girlfriend did a water taste test.
[46:21.72]What does any of this mean?
[46:23.36]It meant something.
[46:24.36]It meant something.
[46:27.32]B, I don't know why there are two grades.
[46:29.16]Why are there two grades?
[46:32.30]Holly, why are there two grades?
[46:34.22]You know what it's for?
[46:35.28]What's the second grade for?
[46:38.13]What does pars mean on the right?
[46:42.54]That's C or S. C or S?
[46:47.48]Which grade?
[46:48.82]I don't know.
[46:52.96]Maybe we were high for this because I don't know what this means.
[47:00.11]Okay, well there's my water taste test.
[47:02.31]What's crazy is you didn't want to show this.
[47:06.55]I asked this
[47:08.04]Yeah, I didn't.
[47:09.00]This is something this is something that I was never gonna bring up ever.
[47:12.00]No.
[47:13.56]This is just something that was done on a day.
[47:17.74]Look at what else do you have?
[47:20.46]Oh, what?
[47:23.56]What time do you have?
[47:26.58]Oh, that's why I took that picture.
[47:28.82]I took that picture.
[47:31.04]Wrong pictures.
[47:32.80]Oh,
[47:35.74]That was a lot of fun.
[47:37.06]It's fun gaming with you guys.
[47:38.58]I like this group.
[47:39.40]It's a good group.
[47:41.73]Well, I'll figure out more games for us.
[47:43.17]Don't worry.
[47:43.87]I'll figure out a bunch of games.
[47:48.81]I think VRChat would be a lot of fun too.
[47:50.97]VRChat sounds amazing.
[47:52.15]I rate Party Animals a plus RD plus plus and I'd say Golf it was maybe like a RRD.
[47:58.66]C or S.
[48:03.66]maybe yeah which I don't know but like it was definitely at least a crd plus plus oh I I have I can't I have no defense on this because I don't know what any of this means crd plus plus
[48:24.42]So which water did you like, Jerma?
[48:26.76]A very obviously reverse osmosis.
[48:31.05]Hold on.
[48:31.63]Sorry.
[48:31.79]I'm going to YouTube that.
[48:33.95]Okay, the RO is an A+.
[48:37.77]Okay, RO was an A+, and an A for both.
[48:40.19]So the left side and the right side, this is me and Holly.
[48:44.25]Holly, what side are you on?
[48:45.01]Are you the red or are you the black?
[48:52.23]Because I did not like Core Water.
[48:55.17]Core Water was a C. I know that for a fact.
[48:57.58]And there's a C twice.
[48:58.38]That's how you know it's real.
[49:01.82]S is Smart Water, and I gave it an A, and then I gave it an ER.
[49:07.18]I... Okay.
[49:09.54]That's, I think, refresh?
[49:11.44]Refresh water?
[49:12.36]There's a B minus... Give it an R for refresh and a D for dehydrate.
[49:17.18]No, no, no, no, no.
[49:18.04]R is refresh.
[49:19.04]D is Dasani.
[49:20.41]I gave Dasani a B and then an S. No, I didn't.
[49:22.65]That's a lie.
[49:23.29]I don't even like that.
[49:23.95]I don't want to show this anymore.
[49:30.13]Why didn't you do this as a tier list?
[49:33.37]Well, because I wanted to... I don't know.
[49:35.26]I...
[49:36.70]Sometimes I just walk around in my fucking underwear and want to drink water with my girlfriend and talk about it for a few minutes.
[49:45.52]Alright, I'm getting out of here.
[49:47.03]I'll see you guys later.
[49:48.95]I'm left speechless.
[49:50.01]There's no follow-up.
[49:52.39]It was a real S-E-R-R plus plus stream, guys.
[49:56.01]See you soon.
[49:57.13]Yeah, B-R-S.
[49:57.81]See you guys.
[49:59.77]Thanks for playing, though, guys.
[50:00.51]It was fun.
[50:01.67]Yeah.
[50:04.09]Okay, well, there's that.
[50:14.48]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[50:16.44]Always a good time with that crew, for sure.
[50:23.78]Not a long one, but they don't have to be.
[50:25.23]I had my fun.
[50:27.61]That was good.
[50:30.39]So now, the next time you see me will be before TwitchCon.
[50:41.75]You will see me before TwitchCon.
[50:44.74]Let me see.
[50:45.98]I don't really have a plan.
[50:47.26]I know a lot of people are asking, but I don't really have a plan to be at TwitchCon.
[50:52.81]I will probably be kind of floating around for some stuff.
[50:56.97]But I don't, it's not like, oh, on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, I'm gonna be walking.
[51:00.82]That's probably, that's not happening.
[51:06.55]So I plan on making an appearance here and there, but it's not like, oh, I've got a meet and greet on the floor.
[51:12.45]No, I'm not doing it at all.
[51:14.95]Just going to kind of hang out in random places.
[51:23.59]Yeah.
[51:25.49]Keep an eye on the sus.
[51:26.25]I'm not going to put the sus as anything right now because I'd rather give you a reliable day in the middle of the week.
[51:34.20]But I'll be live before Twitch comes.
[51:40.17]We'll figure something out.
[51:41.55]Good games.
[51:43.19]Thanks for watching.
[51:43.75]Thanks for hanging out.
[51:45.79]Call your mother.
[51:48.33]Come on.
[51:54.16]What about Steam Next Fest?
[51:56.72]Probably not going to do any streams on it.
[51:58.80]Well, we'll see.
[52:00.14]How long is it going?
[52:04.40]We'll figure it out.
[52:10.88]Take it easy.
[52:11.44]Have a good night.
[52:12.94]See you soon.
[53:01.60]Thank you.
