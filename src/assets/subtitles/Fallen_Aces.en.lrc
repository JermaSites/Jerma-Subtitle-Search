[ve:60.16.100]

[00:30.35]Yeah, that is a 12 minute reverse delay.
[00:32.87]I just want to make this very clear.
[00:36.34]Each minute of the reverse delay makes up for the last probably 10 times I've streamed.
[00:42.44]Let's just say 12 of the last delayed streams.
[00:47.16]Right, so each minute that I reverse delayed wiped that all out, which is about 12 minutes, which is 12 streams.
[00:53.22]How are you?
[00:54.74]You're doing good.
[01:03.48]That's right, everybody.
[01:06.08]For one day only.
[01:09.40]I have to say, I actually don't want to force that meme because I feel like... I feel like six months from now, I'm going to look over and you guys are going to be screaming that every single time I turn the stream on.
[01:22.76]I so badly wanted that to be a thing last time I streamed, and it's been a few weeks, and now I'm considering that to be... Let's not do that.
[01:32.54]Which in turn means you'll do it again next time.
[01:35.22]So you know what?
[01:36.93]I'm back for one day only.
[01:41.71]For five days only.
[01:43.43]Dude, delay.
[01:46.49]You have to delay.
[01:47.07]I need to get some beer.
[01:48.05]That stream hadn't even started yet.
[01:56.71]Slow mode is on too.
[01:58.23]Yeah, and guess what?
[01:59.47]We're going to be having a slow mode activation.
[02:05.69]I'm turning this shit on to like fucking 20 minutes.
[02:15.22]What would a 20 minute slow mode look like?
[02:16.62]Didn't we try this before?
[02:19.24]I feel like we did a 30 minute slow mode one time and it still didn't even do anything.
[02:24.32]How's that possible?
[02:29.40]I think, like, there was still messages every second.
[02:36.17]You know what's interesting, though, is of all the made-up information you might get today, this is probably the most interesting.
[02:43.39]This chat is one of the most active on Twitch, from my understanding, which is really, really cool.
[02:53.17]Just something that I've been, you know, seeing.
[03:04.22]We're desperate.
[03:09.70]I'm here.
[03:10.42]I'm hanging out.
[03:14.34]And I'm gonna play Fallen Aces.
[03:18.06]I'm just gonna play it.
[03:19.64]Looked really fun.
[03:20.54]I was gonna play Gazillionaire, but... That might be for, like, a snooze stream.
[03:26.24]You know what I mean?
[03:27.02]That's, like, I just kind of want to show up and just turn on the snooze button and just stream it for, like, four or five hours.
[03:33.97]Whenever, you know, who fucking knows.
[03:45.47]It's snoozing.
[03:50.01]That's so funny.
[03:50.73]How is this one of the most active Omegalull?
[03:53.45]Well, I... I made that up.
[03:58.93]That's how.
[04:03.71]compound interest stream what do you mean compound interest oh right because the gazillionaire I see you did that for dramatic effect stop stalling I'm just gonna I'm gonna sit here for like at least five more minutes and just listen to the beach you know what I mean just put my arms back and listen to the beach
[04:35.34]What I hear in the background is this.
[04:40.14]Not the beach.
[04:41.65]But, you know, it's sound effects.
[04:47.03]Streaming from... Okay, what would you guys do?
[04:50.21]I already know the answer.
[04:51.01]It'd be just a sea of Omega Lulls.
[04:54.00]If I just turned the stream on one day and I was just wicked sunburned.
[04:56.78]My entire body.
[04:58.08]And I was just out on the beach with, like, sunscreen all over my nose.
[05:04.01]And a fucking cigarette hanging out of my mouth.
[05:05.83]And I was like, yeah, hey, uh, okay, yeah.
[05:09.15]And I just played a game.
[05:10.47]I was just playing a game.
[05:25.63]Would you play Left 4 Dead 2?
[05:27.55]I played a lot of Left 4 Dead.
[05:29.67]Long time ago.
[05:31.39]That is an absolute classic video game.
[05:35.64]I think it's one of the best shooters.
[05:37.56]Period.
[05:39.86]Some of the most fun I've ever had in a co-op session.
[05:42.68]For sure.
[05:46.37]Alright, let's go.
[05:47.77]This is called Fallen Aces.
[05:49.49]If you don't know what this is, it's an early... I think it just went into some type of early access yesterday or the day before.
[05:58.24]It's a game.
[05:58.80]It's kind of like a FPS comic book beat-em-up first-person shooter game.
[06:07.68]It looked really cool.
[06:08.52]I'm like, you know what?
[06:09.80]I guess the first episode is there and it looks pretty fun.
[06:12.42]People seem to like it, so I'm going to give it a try.
[06:17.67]And make sure that you stay tuned, because on June 25th, the Elden Ring DLC streams begin.
[06:28.40]I have to start doing advertisements for future streams, because they might not be for weeks.
[06:35.46]So I have to continue to tell you that.
[06:37.00]All right, let's go.
[06:43.67]Here it is, Fallen Aces.
[06:45.45]How's the audio?
[06:49.07]But one day.
[06:49.61]This is one day only, guys.
[06:52.93]Audio good?
[06:53.39]Alright, heart of glass.
[06:58.98]Wake up call.
[07:02.56]Okay, forget about it.
[07:03.98]Wise guy, eh?
[07:05.20]Or sleep with the fishes.
[07:06.32]This is difficulty.
[07:07.70]Should we go right in the middle?
[07:08.48]A little loud, but it's disgusting.
[07:21.09]Everywhere I go, I'm sure to see the image of you.
[07:27.75]Everyone I know appears to be the image of you.
[07:32.39]I feel like I could be one of these singers and be really good.
[07:35.96]You're there before my eyes.
[07:40.68]If I pick up the evening paper, it's just you in disguise.
[07:47.71]Every day my heart expects to see
[07:51.11]You should run for office.
[07:54.57]No!
[07:54.75]Gianni's in this game?
[07:56.63]Oh shit!
[08:09.42]I'm looking forward to that.
[08:10.48]This is gonna get loud.
[08:15.70]Lower your volume.
[08:19.17]I'm so scared of loud stuff.
[08:22.33]It's gonna get loud.
[08:23.59]Lower your volume, hurry!
[08:25.39]Like, I can't do it.
[08:26.23]Are my arms bolted to the chair?
[08:28.73]You guys need to lower it before something bad happens.
[08:31.61]I'll put it down a li- there we go.
[08:34.87]That's a little bit- that's better.
[08:40.55]All right, here we go.
[08:44.38]Oh my God.
[08:44.84]Oh my God, lower the volume quick.
[08:49.20]I got something to bring up because it's a very important thing about this very topic.
[08:54.56]How many of you?
[08:55.17]Okay, who, who, which of you among us?
[08:59.47]We're not starting yet.
[09:00.59]Which of you among us acts, likes to act as what I like to call the television quarterback?
[09:07.81]And what I mean by that is, you are the one that has the remote, and you have to be the one that prepares for the wicked loud fucking sounds that you know are gonna happen and it's gonna like blow up your fucking room.
[09:22.58]So you like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, down, right?
[09:26.00]Like let's say you've watched, you know, Infinity War for the 15th time this week, which I mean, who doesn't do that?
[09:31.80]And you know, every time you know that here comes like the big explosion on the ship,
[09:36.86]you have to turn the volume down five notches or it's going to be bad.
[09:41.88]And then you have that secondary problem where if you have a volume indicator on the television itself, on the screen, you start to kind of annoy people because then they know when something's coming.
[09:57.05]Where it's like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, this part coming up is pretty good.
[10:00.87]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[10:02.77]Oh, the volume just went down a shitload.
[10:04.17]I wonder if the T-Rex is going to eat the guy.
[10:06.63]Yep.
[10:10.08]I don't know how many of you guys get this, but I know some of you do.
[10:16.02]That's very specific.
[10:21.49]Does it just say your volume, your rules?
[10:25.73]Hey, sorry.
[10:28.87]My TV, my remote, my volume, my rules.
[10:32.06]It'd be like, all right, I don't want to watch a movie over here then, dude.
[10:34.68]Okay.
[10:37.19]I'm going to turn the sensitivity down just a little bit.
[10:42.94]If that's the first thing that somebody says, it's like, oh man, I'm trapped here for two hours.
[10:49.42]You don't go over somebody's house for a movie.
[10:51.58]It's like, yeah, man, come over for the movie.
[10:53.26]By the way, my volume, my rules.
[10:55.47]You can't just leave.
[10:56.35]It's like, oh fuck.
[10:58.45]It drove all the way over here.
[10:59.63]It's even still a little high.
[11:05.73]Is this zero?
[11:09.89]Hey, that's better.
[11:12.75]That's not that's wait.
[11:15.11]Where's the phone?
[11:15.93]Is that the phone or is that an alarm clock?
[11:25.22]OK, some old fashioned alarm clocks did that shit guys.
[11:33.62]How do I get out of here?
[11:39.70]It is this fucking thing.
[11:41.38]How do I get it to shut up?
[11:47.04]It's not- it's not- where's the phone guys?
[11:51.13]Somebody please help me.
[11:52.61]Where is the phone?
[11:55.35]This door is locked!
[11:57.45]Ow!
[11:59.59]I'm very angry.
[12:01.10]Wait, what was kick?
[12:02.14]Oh, Q.
[12:07.53]He can't read.
[12:08.13]I was reading chat.
[12:09.37]I can read.
[12:10.01]I'm reading a different window.
[12:14.07]Oh my god.
[12:14.65]I'm so sorry.
[12:17.37]I love the way this looks though.
[12:18.27]This looks great.
[12:22.29]You can throw shit in this game.
[12:23.23]It's automatically an A. Okay, cool.
[12:28.34]Can you throw literally anything?
[12:31.98]Yep.
[12:35.94]I think I just destroyed the phone.
[12:42.90]I found the phone.
[12:47.88]I didn't soft log the game, did I?
[12:52.36]Who's coming?
[12:52.92]Someone's coming to get me.
[12:56.22]What is this?
[13:00.46]A boxer's guide to... Ow, my stomach.
[13:05.72]Not all boxers can sew, but they must be able to weave.
[13:10.30]Use dodge while moving left, right, or back.
[13:12.28]Okay, so it's a kind of like punch out.
[13:15.38]To leave your opponent punching air.
[13:17.26]Always remember to take deep breaths and mind your stamina.
[13:20.81]If you run out of energy, you can't attack until recovered.
[13:23.55]Okay, so there's a stamina bar.
[13:25.75]There's a dodge left and right.
[13:27.77]Okay, it's a basic jab.
[13:34.43]Okay, measured pace.
[13:35.41]Don't overdo it.
[13:35.75]So that's what that is.
[13:36.59]Shield yourself from incoming damage.
[13:37.57]Well, this won't entirely negate harm from all attacks.
[13:40.25]It's almost always better than... Okay, so it's block.
[13:43.23]A well-timed block is a parry.
[13:44.29]Cool.
[14:02.23]and then an experienced boxer knows when their opponent is near defeat look for a flash and deliver a finisher with use that's e mm-hmm kick it can also ensure a down enemy stays down all right so kicking there's uh attack while moving left to right we'll throw a hook holding attack while moving will do a devastating punch
[14:31.12]Holding attack is a super punch.
[14:33.67]Uppercut.
[14:36.55]Sprint and then... Sprint towards an enemy to knock them aside.
[14:40.03]Okay, so you can push through people.
[14:41.21]Alright, I think I got it.
[14:42.83]So they're right out here right now.
[14:46.43]What the fuck happened?
[14:55.89]I'm already dead.
[14:57.57]I'm already dead.
[14:57.99]Oh, no, I'm not.
[15:03.01]Wait, I can throw shit.
[15:03.83]I can throw stuff at him.
[15:07.49]That, I just underhand softball tossed it to him.
[15:10.43]Alright, this is fun.
[15:13.20]Hit him!
[15:16.64]What do I do with the dead body?
[15:19.40]Wait, should I kick?
[15:34.28]Why am I so huge?
[15:38.09]What happened?
[15:38.53]Why am I like 100 feet tall?
[15:50.94]Wait, should I not be killing them?
[15:55.94]I just grinded him into the ground.
[15:58.98]Okay, I only have five health.
[16:00.74]I'm not playing very well.
[16:04.62]Okay, case file.
[16:08.12]Control is all right.
[16:12.06]Alexia Maureen Price.
[16:13.66]Okay.
[16:14.88]Hope you're doing well.
[16:16.54]I told Mr. Waltz that you're taking over the Alexia Price case.
[16:20.72]Just like we talked about.
[16:21.52]I hate these missing person gigs.
[16:22.98]Okay.
[16:24.38]Here's all the info.
[16:26.48]Last seen one month prior to the assassination attempt on Waltz's life.
[16:30.18]She was on the west side of town near the Golden Tower.
[16:34.97]Okay.
[16:35.53]Golden Tower District.
[16:39.62]Alright, let's go there.
[16:40.28]Okay.
[16:40.50]Okay.
[16:43.46]Cool.
[16:43.66]I get the lore now.
[16:44.84]How do I get health?
[16:45.40]I only have five health.
[17:08.10]Can I, like, drink stuff?
[17:11.44]Can.
[17:12.20]Container.
[17:12.88]Generic can.
[17:15.48]Well, this is a melee weapon now.
[17:16.64]Cool.
[17:16.92]Alright.
[17:23.21]What?
[17:23.55]Oh.
[17:23.67]Alright.
[17:24.37]Here they come.
[17:27.47]I can't break this with a piece of wood?
[17:32.65]Yep.
[17:32.89]Controls.
[17:33.35]Crouch.
[17:33.85]Makes you hard to see.
[17:34.75]Okay.
[17:34.87]Okay.
[17:36.67]I'm gonna, alright, is this a bad guy?
[17:39.99]How do I throw this?
[17:40.95]I just electrocute, oh no, that was the TV.
[17:48.83]Okay, he's dead.
[17:55.18]Okay, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[17:56.36]Alright, alright.
[18:00.00]Oops, did I do that?
[18:06.47]I hope I didn't do that.
[18:07.25]Alright, I got a key.
[18:11.91]That key goes out to the outside thing, right?
[18:14.48]Yeah.
[18:15.36]What about in here?
[18:15.90]Anything?
[18:17.78]No, I wanted to... I didn't want to do that.
[18:18.92]Alright, there's some reading here.
[18:23.44]Uh, note to self, remember to order a new deadbolt with a lot of shady characters.
[18:27.36]Alright.
[18:31.38]I should take some stuff, right?
[18:32.40]Take the frying pan.
[18:33.20]Take the pot.
[18:34.29]Anything in the fridge?
[18:41.06]What the F?
[18:44.73]This might be a little too mature for me.
[18:52.39]I don't think I should play this.
[18:53.87]I think the mature rating is too much for me, I think.
[18:59.76]I have 5 HP still.
[19:06.18]Oh, here we go.
[19:06.92]Here's my, I guess, loadout.
[19:08.42]Okay, there we go.
[19:08.96]That makes sense now.
[19:13.90]I should have done the easy difficulty.
[19:16.04]Should I go in here?
[19:19.51]Alright, let's go.
[19:22.19]This vent is locked?
[19:25.93]Go down.
[19:28.81]Why are you playing an M-rated game, dude?
[19:30.43]I... Stop.
[19:31.83]Great.
[19:47.22]Oh, the elevator is not moving.
[19:52.32]Oops.
[19:58.04]I don't know, some elevators take a long ass time.
[20:03.32]Press F to flip your lighter.
[20:05.68]Ooh.
[20:07.20]You're extra visible to enemies though.
[20:08.66]All right.
[20:16.79]Cool.
[20:16.93]All right.
[20:17.23]I have a fire axe, an ashtray, frying pan.
[20:23.59]And it looks pretty good, I think.
[20:30.91]It's locked.
[20:33.64]I can't take that.
[20:34.32]Alright, how about this?
[20:35.84]Am I going to get electrocuted?
[20:36.62]I might get electrocuted here.
[20:41.00]Oh shit, can I hide?
[20:41.86]Huh?
[20:42.00]Huh?
[21:01.78]This thing is the best item.
[21:03.06]Ladies and gentlemen, it's Thane at the butt.
[21:14.33]Got what you deserve, dickhead.
[21:16.17]Okay.
[21:16.63]Is there like a level up system or is there any experience points or can they drop something?
[21:20.33]Should I not be killing everybody?
[21:21.33]There we go.
[21:25.02]Elevator should be working again.
[21:29.88]That was pretty cat-like, I have to be honest with you.
[21:32.46]That was a cat-like reaction to electricity on the floor.
[21:34.68]Did you see that?
[21:36.36]That was just like a jump.
[21:37.26]I'm out of the way.
[21:38.02]I'm out of there.
[21:41.26]What the fuck?
[21:41.91]That's what I was avoiding that.
[21:43.83]That's exactly what I was trying to avoid.
[21:45.87]How come I didn't get electrocuted?
[21:46.81]What?
[21:53.05]I was just trying to... I was just standing in it.
[21:55.93]It was fine.
[22:03.41]Do I have to do the whole thing again?
[22:04.49]All right, all right, all right.
[22:06.42]Good, good, good, good, good.
[22:07.24]I want to do it again.
[22:07.98]I want to do it again.
[22:09.36]I want to do it again.
[22:16.00]I failed the tutorial.
[22:16.74]But it doesn't matter.
[22:17.50]I didn't even know the controls.
[22:19.06]Okay, here's the phone.
[22:19.67]What do you mean it's not ringing?
[22:22.03]Who the fuck's out here?
[22:26.13]What are you guys doing, guys?
[22:33.49]I went right through.
[22:37.38]How do you do the dodge?
[22:39.44]Is there like a lock on?
[22:40.64]Or did you just actually move left and right?
[22:45.42]Is it while blocking?
[22:46.46]Let me get this right.
[22:49.29]Because it's like a... I don't know.
[22:52.65]It's hard to tell.
[22:53.87]It's shift.
[22:55.23]Shift is dodge?
[22:57.19]Alright, there we go.
[23:07.54]Shift while strafing.
[23:11.10]You sure?
[23:11.48]I'm holding shift right now.
[23:17.67]It doesn't make a difference.
[23:20.99]Alright, let's go.
[23:21.71]Give me a couple of items.
[23:23.81]Give me that.
[23:25.15]Give me this.
[23:29.59]Okay, good.
[23:30.73]Double tapping A and D. I think it actually might just mean get out of the way.
[23:36.33]Double tap?
[23:37.33]Double tap doesn't do anything.
[23:39.25]All right, I know what to do.
[23:40.25]I'm good.
[23:42.83]Why toothpaste?
[23:43.57]Because you know that there's definitely a comedy mode and this where I squeeze it in somebody's face, right?
[23:47.35]It has to be.
[23:51.99]Well, never mind.
[23:53.05]That just almost killed me in one hit.
[24:06.05]I got to rebind that.
[24:06.81]That's got to go.
[24:07.96]Okay.
[24:08.18]All right.
[24:08.42]That's got to come off G. This game is kind of fucking hard.
[24:14.94]Quick save.
[24:15.76]Oh, there's an actual quick save.
[24:17.62]I didn't know that.
[24:21.83]Oh, that says it right there.
[24:23.27]Okay.
[24:24.17]F6 and F9.
[24:24.59]All right.
[24:28.09]First of all, hold on.
[24:29.51]Hold on.
[24:29.87]Hold on.
[24:30.43]These controls got to go.
[24:35.58]Yeah, move left, move right.
[24:37.22]Attack.
[24:38.16]Use gadget.
[24:39.00]Sprint and dodge.
[24:40.14]Yeah, what?
[24:43.10]Shift is dodge?
[24:44.82]It doesn't do anything when I press it.
[24:45.92]Alright, throw, drop.
[24:47.56]We gotta make that a mouse button.
[24:50.01]We're making kick a mouse button.
[24:53.79]Ulcer is H. Okay.
[24:57.39]That's better.
[24:59.77]F6.
[25:00.75]There we go.
[25:01.33]Alright, looking forward to it.
[25:03.13]Double tap shift.
[25:05.39]I don't think that's right.
[25:12.09]All right.
[25:17.01]I need better tools.
[25:19.63]That's not a good tool, but whatever food left.
[25:22.85]Oh, OK, here we go.
[25:24.43]Here's the health.
[25:28.05]I got a whole sandwich.
[25:29.08]If I eat this, I just give me 61.
[25:31.02]That's it.
[25:33.24]I didn't eat the food in the fridge.
[25:36.62]I was working at a 60% health discount already.
[25:45.34]Anything else?
[25:45.82]Is there like knives or anything?
[25:49.60]Alright, I'm ready.
[25:51.61]Now I don't have 20 HP to start the game.
[25:59.35]No, don't throw a pie at him.
[26:01.37]Oh fuck, I don't want that.
[26:09.75]Come on, do it again.
[26:11.27]Sprint is run fast.
[26:12.37]Cool, alright.
[26:13.21]Yeah, manually save manually save.
[26:16.71]Alright, that's good to know.
[26:38.91]I got 100 health.
[26:40.13]I know what I'm doing.
[26:40.75]Bring the... Yeah, bring all this shit.
[26:42.81]Yeah, give me this thing.
[26:44.05]No, this will kill somebody if we hit somebody and have this for sure.
[26:52.90]It really is just quick saves.
[26:54.14]All right, cool.
[26:55.30]Well, that's a great thing because now I can save it right before failing this like five times in a row.
[27:02.20]Okay, did he drop?
[27:05.38]He had... Oh yeah, there it is.
[27:06.63]Lead pipe.
[27:14.29]Things pretty much broken though.
[27:18.40]It's going to be an F6 every 10 seconds kind of day.
[27:21.52]I have no money.
[27:24.34]$2 I don't have $2.
[27:26.74]I'm ready.
[27:41.55]You're going to stream Elden Ring DLC?
[27:43.49]Oh yeah.
[27:46.95]You better believe it.
[27:47.69]I am mentally preparing for that DLC.
[27:53.76]I wonder when it's going to actually launch.
[27:55.98]Like what time.
[28:02.72]I wonder if that's a noon Pacific kind of thing or if that's a midnight kind of thing.
[28:10.41]Alright, let's do this.
[28:12.83]Don't get electrocuted.
[28:13.91]They're gonna get zapped.
[28:23.01]Are they not stupid enough to do this?
[28:25.01]OK, what if I turn it off and then turn it back on real quick?
[28:32.78]OK, I can't turn this off.
[28:34.24]OK.
[28:46.89]There we go.
[28:47.51]I made it out of this tutorial.
[28:48.71]I made it.
[28:50.13]Everybody didn't believe that I was going to get out.
[29:07.51]OK.
[29:10.87]You need to save.
[29:11.69]Oh, I'm saving every.
[29:14.13]I feel like I'm editing a video again.
[29:18.07]That thing would be saved every five minutes, less than that.
[29:20.81]Okay, so this is where I was.
[29:23.64]So I'd back up to the other floor.
[29:25.32]Okay.
[29:41.33]Your face cam looks different.
[29:43.27]Oh, it is in that face cam spot, isn't it?
[29:45.24]With a carton of umbrellas.
[30:02.44]Yeah, this is when you walk in and you go, uh, a special delivery for Mr. Stevenson.
[30:06.84]And then you throw it in the air and all the umbrellas come out.
[30:10.60]You weren't going to use this to fight.
[30:11.72]You were using this as an action distraction.
[30:15.72]Ooh, give me that.
[30:21.14]Oh shit, there's a lot of people there.
[30:27.44]All right, it's E behind an enemy, not kick.
[30:30.62]God damn it.
[30:32.83]Do I dare save it here?
[30:33.79]Yeah.
[30:35.83]They're all coming.
[30:41.27]Hold on.
[30:41.57]They're all coming this way.
[30:43.10]Somebody there.
[30:50.20]Will they notice me?
[30:51.00]All right.
[30:52.78]Quit kidding around.
[30:54.44]Come out.
[30:56.92]They just left him here to die like a dog.
[31:11.30]Action!
[31:11.57]Distraction!
[31:15.49]Ow!
[31:19.93]Spray him!
[31:26.11]That hurt!
[31:29.65]Get over here!
[31:33.72]Sit down!
[31:40.17]Oh shit, they're throwing stuff.
[31:49.40]I'm out of stamina.
[31:53.07]Here, have some cigarettes!
[31:55.43]Yeah, that's me.
[32:12.40]Is that it?
[32:18.74]What?
[32:22.02]Who's going, no, no, no?
[32:32.89]A doll?
[32:33.41]Nobody has any money.
[32:34.51]Why does nobody have any money?
[32:45.04]Front door key.
[32:47.64]There's some money.
[32:48.24]$7.
[32:48.26]$21?
[32:48.32]Nice.
[32:48.94]Okay, I can get out of here.
[32:53.16]Wait.
[32:53.95]Can I store these?
[32:57.93]What's worth more of the... Whatever.
[33:00.39]Eat this.
[33:04.62]Should I get a pack of cigarettes?
[33:05.62]Oh, I'm going to save my money.
[33:09.04]I'm saving it.
[33:18.17]I don't know if that was a bad guy.
[33:19.37]I was just throwing stuff.
[33:24.43]Do I have anything else besides food in my fucking inventory?
[33:27.19]What is going on?
[33:27.77]Okay, get to Pete's place.
[33:36.00]No, I want to like go through the trash.
[33:42.92]No, I'm definitely keeping the pie.
[33:44.06]Eat the banana.
[33:55.02]Okay, the trash can lid seems pretty good.
[33:58.87]I gotta find Pete's place.
[34:02.35]You just put it on the ground.
[34:09.93]Oh, wait.
[34:10.37]Okay, this is just... Okay, that's just a... Why would I do that?
[34:13.31]Cool.
[34:22.42]Oh, my God.
[34:23.28]Thanks for the reminder.
[34:25.52]Okay, I'm loading the game.
[34:28.76]I'm loading the game.
[34:29.34]Was it F7?
[34:30.94]Was it F7 or F8?
[34:31.58]Is it F9?
[34:39.10]It's like it never happened.
[34:40.02]Don't worry.
[34:47.47]Okay.
[34:50.83]Well, Pete's place is not there.
[34:54.19]Go this way.
[35:04.18]So what's the rumpus?
[35:05.32]Glassjaw says bandettos are out.
[35:07.46]That means this side of town is right for the pickings.
[35:10.42]Finally.
[35:11.46]About time we showed those smug bastards who really owns this town.
[35:15.53]Damn straight.
[35:16.37]This war's only the beginning.
[35:17.97]Town's only big enough for one gang, and ain't nobody gonna stand in Glassjaw's way.
[35:22.63]Yeah.
[35:23.35]Yo, hey.
[35:25.12]Not that dumb shit.
[35:26.16]The detective?
[35:27.28]Boss is real specific about him.
[35:29.76]Name's Thane.
[35:30.78]Michael Thane.
[35:31.62]But don't you worry about that.
[35:33.26]The boys are gonna make sure he takes a nice, long, dirt nap with the worms.
[35:38.16]Him and his friend.
[35:40.26]Huh?
[35:40.60]Who got his mic?
[35:43.60]Who are you?
[35:45.26]I hear a fight.
[35:46.40]Damn it, he didn't work.
[35:47.47]We can take him.
[35:59.74]I was trying to do something cool.
[36:01.50]There we go.
[36:02.28]That's what I was looking for.
[36:03.36]Now step on it.
[36:06.34]We're still alive.
[36:13.03]I want to check up here.
[36:19.05]Dollar Store Captain America.
[36:20.85]What are you talking about?
[36:27.56]I think that's everything.
[36:44.37]A barbershop.
[36:46.27]What?
[36:47.37]What's wrong?
[36:48.35]What?
[36:49.29]I just want to get my hair cut.
[36:50.17]I don't know what's going on.
[36:51.08]Why are they so mad at me?
[36:51.86]I don't understand.
[36:54.44]Where did that guy go?
[37:14.33]Alright, I want a haircut.
[37:15.11]I can have anything?
[37:17.87]The trash can lid?
[37:18.43]Fine, I'll get rid of it.
[37:44.94]That's not the right button.
[37:47.36]You happy?
[37:51.45]Take this.
[37:53.69]That's my payment.
[37:54.37]I want the gumball machine.
[38:04.39]Wait.
[38:05.96]Um.
[38:11.21]I'm sorry I'm being a weirdo.
[38:13.01]I'm so sorry.
[38:14.22]I did not know.
[38:15.28]Okay.
[38:15.38]What do you have in the boxes?
[38:22.73]Yeah, you can have whatever I want back there.
[38:25.09]Including, and not limited to, only cardboard boxes.
[38:29.47]That's it.
[38:29.89]There's nothing else back there.
[38:40.37]There's nothing even in here!
[38:41.23]Alright, what do you got?
[38:56.30]Ooh!
[38:58.48]Nothing hits like a good cup of joe.
[39:09.74]Yep.
[39:10.54]Do you have any money?
[39:14.36]What's on the note?
[39:23.72]Those damn Benedettos.
[39:26.00]They have their iron grip on this whole neighborhood and my wallet.
[39:28.72]These monthly payments are killing me.
[39:30.16]I can't keep up with their demands.
[39:32.12]How do they expect me to keep getting more customers when goons are loitering around the place all day?
[39:38.02]I've had nothing but trouble ever since those grease balls waltzed right into my shop.
[39:42.98]Can't trust the coppers and I'd be a fool to try something smart with these hoods.
[39:48.12]I only hope that one day the Benedettos get what's coming to them.
[39:52.68]Okay.
[39:58.86]That's not as interesting as a pie.
[40:06.81]Not bad.
[40:10.01]What else you got?
[40:11.29]There are guns.
[40:14.47]There's guns.
[40:16.11]The tougher you are, the less damage you take.
[40:20.18]I need a bigger inventory.
[40:25.58]Will you get rid of this?
[40:27.34]Okay.
[40:29.40]Um... I kind of want the wrench, though.
[40:32.38]I feel like the wrench is very important.
[40:37.54]Eye is better than a medkit.
[40:38.96]Is it, actually?
[40:41.48]Okay, well, I... I'm gonna... This looks good to me.
[40:48.84]Hey, you're making me nervous with that thing, pal.
[40:57.07]Drugstore.
[41:05.23]Sorry, we're closed.
[41:13.88]Do I get in trouble for this?
[41:17.78]Hmm.
[41:33.91]Oh shit!
[41:46.59]An Adobe Flash?
[41:48.08]What is that?
[41:48.50]Alright, I did nothing wrong.
[41:59.16]I got nothing, nothing happened.
[42:04.63]Is this just free?
[42:08.91]It can't be, but I'm just going to have it.
[42:12.81]Alright, we need to find Pete's place.
[42:15.35]Did it say where Pete lived or where Pete was?
[42:17.69]What is Pete's place?
[42:25.33]Save, I just saved.
[42:31.77]It's a pizza place.
[42:35.23]OK.
[42:38.22]Can't go that way.
[42:38.90]So it's gotta be like down one of the alleys over here.
[42:42.22]Got what you deserve, dickhead.
[42:53.04]What's up here?
[42:59.38]Secrets know.
[43:01.67]Alright, so where where am I going here?
[43:03.05]Any pizza place?
[43:13.17]Eat!
[43:16.73]Eat!
[43:17.63]Oh shit!
[43:18.23]Hold and release to throw at your- Okay, right, right, right.
[43:22.94]Can I throw the bullet at him really fast and will it hurt?
[43:43.49]Good luck.
[43:46.50]That guy's got a wrench.
[43:47.76]Oh, that's a fresh pipe.
[43:51.52]Hmm.
[44:14.36]I gotta keep track of where they all are.
[44:15.56]Do you eat the gum?
[44:23.69]Ooh!
[44:27.35]Damn it.
[44:28.57]Well, yeah, we're using this.
[44:30.55]I can sneak in here.
[44:32.21]I can sneak out here.
[44:33.81]And I can sneak in here.
[44:40.16]Register?
[44:47.67]Oh, there's stuff in here.
[44:48.37]Wait, wait, wait.
[44:48.79]Can I break the item?
[44:49.63]Can I break the glass?
[44:51.87]Alright, comic shop key.
[44:55.53]Cool.
[45:04.45]I unlocked it with the key.
[45:06.73]Was nothing else in here?
[45:08.93]Ooh.
[45:12.31]Secret.
[45:13.73]Okay.
[45:15.73]What does that do?
[45:20.08]It's kind of weird.
[45:20.58]I love hurting people.
[45:55.53]Are you looking for a fight?
[45:57.37]You come to the right place, pal.
[46:01.23]Oh, that would hurt.
[46:01.83]Card game?
[46:04.17]Then stay down, asshole.
[46:06.13]What secret bullshit's going on in here?
[46:19.84]Come on.
[46:23.76]What in the wild?
[46:34.23]Wait, are these shotgun?
[46:35.77]Shotgun ammo?
[46:38.49]Oh, fuck.
[46:38.97]Hold on.
[46:44.30]I'll pick that up later.
[46:45.44]I have all this ammo.
[46:48.42]Is this moved money?
[46:50.66]Looks like we're going to the mattresses with the glass hearts.
[46:54.24]Okay.
[46:54.36]Shotgun on wall?
[47:24.38]I thought this was a picture.
[47:25.50]Oh, but no, I dropped all the bullets and I didn't.
[47:31.91]Oh my God, that's a disaster.
[47:34.33]Dropped a fucking radiator.
[47:37.69]This is not like playing a board game, man.
[47:39.93]This is incredibly important and dangerous.
[47:48.00]Fuck you.
[47:48.90]I'm talking to people.
[47:51.24]How many bullets do I have?
[47:57.07]Okay, well.
[48:00.05]Shoot somebody with a shotgun.
[48:01.51]We're like fucking 500, a thousand yards away.
[48:05.47]All right, behind the dumpster.
[48:07.49]I need a bigger inventory.
[48:08.82]Fucking, I can't believe I lost all that shit.
[48:15.04]Okay, whatever.
[48:20.08]I hear something twinkling.
[48:27.05]You hear the twinkling?
[48:29.73]Wait, another note.
[48:32.64]For every Aces Back issue, you know the vintage Howard Whitman stuff.
[48:35.58]Okay.
[48:41.81]Something is twinkling.
[48:43.13]I can hear it.
[48:46.51]Is that a secret?
[48:47.19]What's going on?
[49:00.58]What am I?
[49:01.06]What is going on here?
[49:03.06]What is happening?
[49:04.18]What was that?
[49:07.64]What was that?
[49:28.41]How do I how do I disarm?
[49:29.41]How do I disarm myself?
[49:30.63]How do I disarm?
[49:31.67]Get out of here.
[49:38.45]Next.
[49:41.29]It's HHH there.
[49:42.50]Ooh, a penny.
[49:56.56]Something... No, I'm not down over there.
[49:59.08]Something's twinkling in here.
[50:00.14]I heard it.
[50:07.02]What is it?
[50:10.25]Behind the boxes?
[50:12.13]Ah!
[50:12.31]What is it?
[50:13.59]Comic shop key.
[50:15.87]Didn't I already have this?
[50:19.11]There's a different key.
[50:29.50]I think that's the same key.
[50:34.40]Is there a locked thing up here?
[50:35.79]I don't think so.
[50:41.63]Maybe a different comic shop?
[50:42.85]I'll just keep going then.
[50:44.75]I am hearing twinkly sounds.
[50:49.44]I can't seem to find... It's in this room.
[50:56.52]Oh well.
[50:58.12]That'll be for playthrough number 30.
[50:59.24]Alright, I'm gonna go in here.
[51:08.53]Not for very long though, because this is going to hurt.
[51:29.02]Can I, like, get through this somehow?
[51:30.56]I don't know.
[51:35.60]Should I... Ah!
[51:37.28]Nope.
[51:47.73]Wait, the fire extinguisher would work.
[51:51.17]It probably would.
[51:57.38]It was a fire extinguisher in here.
[52:01.72]There was.
[52:02.34]Awww.
[52:04.04]Who needs health?
[52:04.40]Just get good.
[52:34.09]I tried to, I can do it better and just, this is the worst part about being live.
[52:37.94]I would have recorded this like nine times and then just used this one instead.
[52:42.82]I would record it 10 times and used this one instead.
[52:48.73]I can't do it anymore.
[52:49.47]I'm 40.
[52:49.85]Nevermind.
[52:53.43]That was perfect timing for that sound.
[53:02.16]I'm trying to do the Toad, the, like, when Toad uses a mushroom in Mario Kart.
[53:10.93]Just in time for the worst joke of the year?
[53:12.77]It don't matter.
[53:14.85]They're all gonna be bad from here on out.
[53:16.43]I got news for you.
[53:27.67]Fuck, I need more juice than this.
[53:30.27]Ah, nuts.
[53:40.11]Sounded like there was some juice in there still.
[53:44.96]Is there another one?
[53:45.48]No, I'll take the help.
[54:02.95]Any more fire extinguishers?
[54:05.86]Nah.
[54:10.18]Yeah.
[54:11.36]Wait, is this a, that's not a fire extinguisher, but it'd be fun to do this.
[54:21.05]This is probably a really bad place to bring this, but I've, I'm gonna.

[55:33.94]The door is just closed.
[55:35.45]Windows closed.
[55:36.17]First of all, I don't know how you didn't hear any of that, but a, a large wily coyote.
[55:50.29]Oh, they probably heard all that.
[55:53.63]Oh, wait, that's the guy.
[56:06.54]He's doing the Left 4 Dead strat that gets everybody fucking killed and always seems like a good idea, doesn't it?
[56:21.62]Somebody said I have to take a dump?
[56:24.72]What?
[56:31.96]Did I just... Hold on, turn this off.

[67:22.61]Okay, wait.
[67:23.33]Goons can wake other goons they find.
[67:27.11]So what's the downside to just killing everybody?
[67:29.82]Is there a downside?
[67:33.84]I'm sure this is probably like a don't kill anybody playthrough or something, right?

[68:29.60]I'm afraid you missed out on the finger sandwiches.
[68:33.28]Listen, you probably have a lot of questions.
[68:35.96]If you want to get out of here alive, you need to follow my instructions.
[68:40.01]Take the lift up top.
[68:41.39]There's something you need to see.
[68:55.15]That it?
[68:56.23]Let's go.
[69:08.18]Wait, it's him.
[69:11.17]Hey.
[69:15.25]Well, what do you have?
[69:15.95]You have something to show me?
[69:16.93]Oh, I have to go into the room.
[69:20.53]That's our ticket out of here.
[69:22.29]You'll need to figure out a way to lower it so we can drive across and make our escape.
[69:26.75]The bridge controls are on the other side of the harbor.
[69:29.55]Once you lower the bridge, rendezvous with me back here and I'll explain everything.
[69:34.70]Okay.
[69:35.62]What the hell are you going to do while I'm out here risking my neck?
[69:39.94]I'll be searching for a missing person.
[69:45.40]I thought I could get in.
[69:46.32]I thought I could get in.
[69:54.51]It was like a wild ape.
[69:55.80]Okay.
[70:02.44]Lower the bridge.
[70:04.84]Okay.
[70:05.04]Okay, so I gotta remember how to get back here.
[70:07.96]Right.
[70:25.16]OK.
[70:25.40]All right, lower the drawbridge.
[70:28.24]OK.
[70:54.47]Checking the corners, you never know.
[70:59.29]Just checking the corners.
[71:05.17]All right, gonna get across there.
[71:06.13]I gotta put the bridge down.
[71:07.12]So let's see what is right up front.
[71:18.60]OK, this was this did not work in the tutorial, by the way.
[71:24.37]Dodge?
[71:28.31]I actually can dodge now.
[71:29.95]Okay.
[71:35.33]Hold on.
[71:35.73]Wait a minute.
[71:37.95]We've got a boat coming into Stormwind Harbor.
[71:41.11]Do it.
[71:47.39]Yeah.
[71:48.85]Yeah.
[71:49.69]You heard it.
[72:00.00]That is the... Big shootout?
[72:05.80]Boss got hit?
[72:11.02]That's the same sound that's in World of Warcraft.
[72:13.34]Do you get it?
[72:14.02]Can I kick this open?
[72:17.13]Alright, lots of oil over there.
[72:32.37]Don't scab on your pals.
[72:34.79]Don't be a rat.
[72:41.62]I gone for decent wages and conditions.
[72:44.40]Not penny off the workers wages.
[72:46.00]Hello?
[73:02.05]I can fit under there.
[73:02.87]Damn it.
[73:07.36]Can I not fit under there?
[73:12.14]Wait.
[73:18.12]This has got to be a secret, right?
[73:36.22]Oh, shit.
[73:37.92]I can hear.
[73:38.26]What about around the corner?
[73:42.18]What?
[73:44.38]No.
[73:44.56]All right.
[73:44.86]All right.
[73:45.86]Let's go kick some ass.
[74:03.38]I just bent the bat over him.
[74:06.44]Oh shit, whatever.
[74:07.22]This isn't a knife.
[74:08.62]Alright, I'll take the bottles.
[74:11.42]You can probably light that on fire.
[74:32.95]Okay, what do we got?
[74:38.87]Ooh, good.
[74:42.81]Not bad.
[74:43.75]What's this?
[74:47.87]We hit the jackpot.
[74:48.61]Here's the lowdown.
[74:50.07]We struck a deal with the crew of that freighter docked across the harbor.
[74:53.52]They were hauling a special shipment.
[74:54.78]Six boxes of Tommy Guns body armor and some sniper rifles.
[74:59.22]Okay.
[75:02.59]We stashed it away in the A1 warehouse.
[75:07.99]A1 warehouse.
[75:08.59]I just ran up to him to let him punch me in the face.
[75:32.09]Is this warehouse A1?
[75:32.97]Oh, that's the office.
[75:36.39]Okay.
[75:39.41]A1 sauce?
[75:39.83]That's great on a burger.
[75:40.55]It's one of the only places I like A1.
[75:43.42]You got a name?
[75:44.34]Just call me Nightwave.
[75:47.50]They print that on your birth certificate?
[75:50.94]Well, whatever.
[75:52.10]Listen, pal, any chance you could put that pop gun to work and nail some more of these creeps living around the place?
[75:56.64]Unfortunately, we only have a few rounds left.
[76:00.12]Just give me a signal.
[76:02.20]No!
[76:03.44]I didn't save it and I should have.
[76:10.79]Cycle through gadgets.
[76:12.81]Oh, I actually can use him.
[76:14.29]He can shoot people?
[76:15.23]Alright, that's kind of cool.
[76:21.68]You're not cut out for this line of work.
[76:31.02]Okay, let me get back up there.
[76:31.84]There's definitely something up on this tower.
[76:43.95]Really?
[76:44.17]There has to be a point to this, right?
[76:49.63]Why let me do this?
[76:51.89]There has to be a reason.
[76:58.02]Okay.
[77:00.68]Jump up to there?
[77:01.42]Or jump from here to there?
[77:14.23]Get up to the roof?
[77:23.17]Oh, wait a minute.
[77:23.87]This was a little dark.
[77:27.75]I couldn't see.
[77:28.25]Alright, so now we're up here.
[77:31.28]I still need to go to the warehouse.
[77:40.98]Feel like I'm flying over the whole level with the flight suit on and Mario.
[77:46.68]I don't know whatever one Mario 3.
[77:53.36]OK, hold on, what's over here?
[77:56.74]Oh my fucking God.
[78:00.23]I'm so angry right now.
[78:01.89]You have no idea.
[78:03.63]All of my health is gone.
[78:04.67]I'm so pissed.
[78:07.82]But I can't... I can't hit F9.
[78:11.48]It'll be all right.
[78:40.72]There are two-year-olds watching?
[78:43.74]I don't... No, there are not.
[78:46.36]No, there are not.
[78:47.92]That is a wrong statement.
[78:50.65]That's what you said is just wrong.
[78:53.27]It's wrong.
[78:53.81]Okay, I'm up here.
[79:00.09]I'm not gonna be able to kill these guys.
[79:17.96]Wait, I have a sniper.
[79:25.16]This one.
[79:28.63]He's right there.
[79:29.93]This one.
[79:32.25]Take care of him.
[79:35.23]Take care of him.
[79:38.88]Where is this guy supposed to be?
[79:40.20]Okay, who can you kill?
[79:43.76]A good thing to start with.
[79:45.52]Where are you currently?
[79:47.26]Because he could be in the bathroom.
[79:49.60]He could be... Where is he?
[80:10.89]Oh, I'm in so much trouble.
[80:12.63]I'm going to have to save it here.
[80:13.79]I just may have fucked everything.
[80:15.89]But we're going for it.
[80:19.59]Wait, there could be food in the trash.
[80:21.34]Get over here.
[80:31.71]Are you a tough guy?
[80:32.49]Come on.
[80:40.90]Ow!
[80:42.50]Oh, don't taunt me like that.
[80:44.10]Whoa!
[80:45.88]Oh my god.
[81:14.36]Here we go.
[81:16.14]Alright, somebody drop some food.
[81:17.36]That was my drinking buddy.
[81:29.29]What I was going to say is I love the.
[81:31.87]I love the trophy character of the bad guy henchman that always somehow that always kind of laughs to himself about everything.
[81:40.69]I love that character.
[81:41.53]It's like one of my favorite characters.
[81:45.09]It's like, oh, the boss has got a big plan with you.
[81:58.55]I love that.
[81:59.41]It's like, it adds so much to like, I love it.
[82:03.01]Okay.
[82:03.84]There's a key in here.
[82:05.56]Hmm.
[82:20.59]That's locked.
[82:21.25]Alright, where's the... I think it's up there.
[82:29.81]Oh shit!
[82:35.64]Wait, they can punch each other?
[82:44.90]That's surprising.
[82:53.53]Oh fuck, I took too many hits.
[82:55.83]Ooh, um... That's not fair.
[83:08.30]That is very much not fair.
[83:15.40]You ate it all!
[83:20.58]You gonna leave any for the rest of us?
[83:26.91]How do I?
[83:27.33]Wait, just put him down.
[83:29.37]That didn't hurt.
[83:40.70]This shit broke in half.
[83:43.74]This thing's made out of plastic.
[83:46.30]There's no more apples in here.
[83:47.54]I could have just done that.
[83:51.90]God damn it.
[83:52.48]Okay, well, whatever.
[83:53.12]It's fine.
[83:56.49]This is A1.
[83:57.15]I got a key for this place.
[84:03.65]Okay.
[84:19.51]Guy over there.
[84:34.95]What's that over there?
[84:41.70]Look at that!
[84:44.24]20 bucks?
[84:45.78]Oh, that's a lot of money.
[84:48.60]Nice.
[84:48.86]Okay.
[84:52.03]Anything else?
[84:55.15]Not something else in here, right?
[85:01.16]Was that the money they were talking about?
[85:02.36]Weren't there guns or something stored here?
[85:04.55]Okay, guys.
[85:15.46]I just realized I could have done this stupid joke that five people are going to understand and I almost fell off.
[85:22.26]Okay, guys.
[85:24.70]How many boxes are there?
[85:28.38]How many boxes are there?
[85:31.94]One of those puzzles.
[85:32.65]Can I hit him from all the... We'll even know where this came from.
[85:48.94]I think I killed him.
[86:01.91]I don't know if that guy was a stupid asshole.
[86:03.99]He kind of majorly got the drop on him.
[86:06.59]He watched it.
[86:13.34]What the?
[86:13.92]Wait, why is he awake?
[86:15.24]He got fucking flying saucer to the head.
[86:17.32]I can't fucking believe that guy just killed me.
[86:38.53]I was trying to do a funny Batman, flies in and falls down.
[86:56.31]Okay.
[87:09.50]That one, that one was not intentional.
[87:14.85]This little ridge that I'm stuck on.
[87:18.93]Every time you reload a save, you have to redo the joke you just did.
[87:21.97]Oh, so the actual, the me, myself are part of the save state.
[87:27.32]See, there's a lip right here.
[87:28.34]And I, I pressed W to see.
[87:31.54]Let me explain to you why that happened.
[87:32.92]There you go.
[87:33.84]All right.
[87:35.78]No more messing around.
[87:36.42]We're going to do this clean.
[87:38.28]Watch this.
[87:38.62]3, 2, 1.
[87:38.70]Imagine jumping over somebody's punch.
[87:42.05]Oh, fake out.
[87:42.91]Hey, thanks for coming to the party.
[88:05.04]Okay.
[88:12.10]I don't want both.
[88:16.83]I'm underneath the car.
[88:24.57]It's a grenade!
[88:25.75]A guy threw a brick at me.
[88:29.44]A guy threw a brick at me.
[88:36.17]Shit.
[88:36.69]Okay, I need a weapon.
[88:42.28]I need a weapon.
[88:42.94]I need something.
[88:44.28]I guess I could use this.
[88:45.10]Alright.
[88:47.92]35 health.
[88:48.20]Save it.
[89:08.11]Give me this too.
[89:14.06]Ooh, this is... I was already in here.
[89:24.57]That wasn't a secret at all.
[89:25.67]Okay, what about...
[89:34.55]What about that office?
[89:35.41]There's an office over here.
[89:36.23]I can go in now.
[89:37.99]Yeah, up here.
[89:50.43]Ooh, door control.
[89:51.81]All right.
[89:52.27]A1.
[89:54.17]B1.
[89:54.61]Let's open them both.
[90:01.04]Oh, that's convenient.
[90:02.60]What is in here?
[90:14.09]I hear something twinkling.
[90:15.55]Hold on.
[90:19.83]Where is it?
[90:22.21]It might be in the office.
[90:35.90]Oh, there's a gun.
[90:42.19]And a speed loader.
[90:44.07]Uh, I don't need this anymore.
[90:50.02]I did need all the shit on the desk though, which is annoying.
[90:52.36]Okay.
[90:52.96]Okay.
[91:00.45]Well, uh, shipping delay.
[91:03.91]Just reload.
[91:10.13]I think the quick load is back when I was up on the rafter.
[91:12.27]I don't want to do that.
[91:15.79]Okay, there's nothing.
[91:16.55]No info on this.
[91:17.21]Just some lore.
[91:17.85]Okay, so this pistol whips.
[91:23.60]I'm going to save this for like a boss.
[91:26.36]Cool.
[91:26.64]Alright, I got a gun.
[91:29.68]These are now open.
[91:31.36]Let's go into... Is this going to kill me?
[91:34.26]If this hurts at all, I'm reloading.
[91:45.48]Stop treating the game like Resident Evil?
[91:48.42]I want to kill the level boss in one hit.
[91:51.34]I swear to God.
[92:01.93]No reloads?
[92:05.79]Okay, just walk down like a normal person.
[92:09.70]Walk down like a normal person.
[92:12.46]Look, I'm going down here.
[92:15.40]I don't need to leap off of a 50-foot drop.
[92:19.54]Okay.
[92:21.08]So, apparently there was a secret in here.
[92:22.90]Holy shit.
[92:32.01]Holy shit.
[92:32.91]I'm saving all this for the boss.
[92:33.71]Is somebody in here?
[92:40.89]Wow.
[92:42.47]What do I do with this?
[92:43.17]There's so much cool stuff in here.
[92:44.45]Okay, I want to have a safe state for this so I can come look at it.
[92:52.33]Cool.
[92:56.40]Okay.
[92:57.98]And then there's a Tommy gun?
[93:02.24]Molotovs?
[93:03.44]Shit.
[93:08.19]I don't know what I want to take.
[93:11.30]I guess I could just get... How many shots are in this?
[93:13.30]One, two, six.
[93:16.60]Okay.
[93:17.32]I guess should I keep the reload or take the Tommy gun?
[93:25.04]Tommy gun has a lot of bullets.
[93:29.03]Okay.
[93:29.65]But I do want to see what this does.
[93:35.45]Epic.
[93:36.51]Interesting.
[94:06.91]I just want to do my job and go home.
[94:15.08]What the?
[94:16.50]What's happening?
[94:17.56]Why could I just forgot how to play the game?
[94:19.56]What?
[94:30.80]I tried to right click and I didn't hurt him.
[94:39.95]Alright, let's go.
[94:40.67]Shit, this is going to break.
[94:48.43]Oh my god.
[94:57.97]Same thing happened to me.
[95:01.53]Alright, I'm going to snipe.
[95:02.49]I'm going to snipe.
[95:02.95]That guy has a sniper rifle.
[95:05.09]I'll get him.
[95:21.14]Oh shit, that guy's a gun.
[95:52.62]Did I get everybody?
[95:53.14]Okay, I'm satisfied.
[96:24.16]That's a lot of bullshit over here.
[96:25.64]Hopefully nobody shoots or throws a grenade or something, right?
[96:39.33]You gotta press E. I keep forgetting.
[96:46.14]I was reading chat and I was walked off the edge.
[96:47.62]I don't know where I am.
[96:48.24]There I am.
[96:48.58]Okay.
[96:52.63]Hey, look at that.
[96:54.03]Ooh, scoped repeater.
[96:56.65]Oh, the thing doesn't even work.
[97:06.94]Did I just hit somebody?
[97:09.98]Did I?
[97:10.40]No, I didn't.
[97:10.90]Did I hit somebody over there?
[97:12.20]Well, what do we have here?
[97:23.48]I just started a fire over there.
[97:29.85]Oh no!
[97:30.19]Is that guy gonna get out?
[97:35.11]You gotta look real close, but there's a guy right there.
[97:41.30]Okay, should I jump from here?
[97:42.52]No, no way.
[97:47.38]I guess I could just go up here.
[97:55.67]Somebody's sneaking around.
[98:07.14]The range on that is very, very, um... Okay, it's very good.
[98:16.07]Uh, does anybody see this?
[98:35.45]Keep the change filthy animal
[99:13.28]Alright, I gotta load the bridge.
[99:14.16]The water is teeming with sharks.
[99:17.00]Sharks?
[99:17.52]Be very cautious if you think about swimming across.
[99:33.25]They didn't really mean that, did they?
[99:36.02]No, they couldn't have.
[99:37.64]Deal with the fucking sharks!
[99:39.86]How about some of this?
[99:48.20]What?
[99:50.38]Why is that guy asleep?
[99:58.81]There we go.
[100:01.69]Have fun with the sharks.
[100:05.39]Where are they?
[100:22.47]You have sharks in here.
[100:23.33]I can't shoot the gun.
[100:43.12]I jumped out of the water and shot myself in the head apparently.
[100:46.84]Apparently I freaked out, jumped out of the water and just shot myself in the face.
[100:54.18]Okay, well, that's a cool thing, but not... Okay.
[101:04.38]Can't grab that?
[101:05.40]Why not?
[101:08.87]That's weird.
[101:09.71]Okay, well.
[101:13.95]Alright.
[101:26.34]wow grandpa grandpa was just watching the news and he was just he was really really excited where is he up there can I reach him from here definitely not
[101:53.28]Oh, I am the world's greatest gamer.
[101:56.80]How about you?
[102:06.67]Okay, I'm out of bullets.
[102:21.98]Does this thing have any bullets?
[102:24.06]Fucking useless.
[102:25.70]Wait, there probably was bullets.
[102:26.64]I'm going to reload.
[102:27.20]There may have been bullets like in the next area.
[102:30.26]Oops.
[102:30.56]Okay, I'm going to make it.
[102:42.44]I'm going to jump it.
[102:42.94]I'm going to jump it.
[102:43.76]Is this guy okay?
[102:46.05]I'm doing just fine.
[102:47.09]Better than ever.
[102:50.34]Alright, can I get- the question is can I get the gun?
[102:52.14]Uh, the answer is no.
[103:13.00]This is what retirement does to you.
[103:19.52]Oh, please.
[103:21.16]Go watch any stream from the last ten fucking years.
[103:38.00]My mousepad is falling down.
[103:43.22]My mousepad was sliding up from underneath me.
[103:56.51]Ooh.
[103:57.33]Okay, is this for the sharks or what?
[104:01.65]Or just in general, anything?
[104:02.63]Okay.
[104:07.60]I hate to kill these creatures, but they're becoming quite a problem.
[104:10.84]Ooh, I can get my... I can definitely get my gun back.
[104:19.61]Shit.
[104:23.48]Hold on a second.
[104:29.42]There we go.
[104:31.60]Can't reload it.
[104:33.11]Oh, this is this is for the other gun shit, OK?
[104:39.93]Well, what do we have here?
[104:41.23]Still have two shots in this thing.
[104:45.47]OK, uhm.
[104:50.68]What's the ultimate goal?
[104:52.52]Turn to... Okay, it's over here.
[104:54.72]I mean, I made it all the way across.
[104:59.08]Technically, I did, right?
[105:03.95]This is the best weapon in the game.
[105:10.41]Okay.
[105:31.29]OK, so this is over here.
[105:33.41]I've unlocked that.
[105:36.07]This leads back to the beginning.
[105:37.47]This is where the walkie talkie.
[105:41.64]So this is the shortcut back here.
[105:47.78]So then.
[105:51.16]Is it the other side then that I have to open?
[105:53.24]Or maybe up here?
[105:54.46]Uh, hey, I wouldn't stand so close to the edge there.
[106:01.24]I saw one of them dockhands lean over like that and a shark just flung out of the water like a cotton hook.
[106:09.57]Ah, you were an asshole, shark.
[106:11.21]You didn't deserve this.
[106:24.54]Listen, you're already in deep shit.
[106:26.16]I don't know you get the hell out of here.
[106:30.78]What just happened?
[106:44.09]The music I shot him right in the face.
[106:46.97]Alright, I'm going to try to go across the whole thing and I'm going to use this thing that they gave to me for a reason.
[106:54.12]Okay, I'm just going to go across.
[106:55.08]I'm just going to swim to the other side.
[106:58.18]Here we go.
[106:58.64]I might not even need to use it.
[107:08.39]Oh my goodness.
[107:09.15]Okay.
[107:11.11]Oh, they're swarming.
[107:12.64]They're swarming.
[107:41.06]What was that aim?
[107:42.43]What was that aim?
[107:43.45]Why did I shoot 500 yards to my left?
[107:48.23]I can climb the net.
[107:50.17]Get on it!
[107:50.55]I just saw climb.
[107:51.89]I was on the screen.
[107:53.53]What just happened?
[107:54.03]It said climb.
[107:55.73]I couldn't do it. ...
[108:09.77]Are you gonna delete your YouTube after you retire?
[108:12.07]I'm not deleting anything.
[108:15.12]I have a test here.
[108:25.08]Okay, I gotta try this.
[108:27.10]It's important to give it a try.
[108:31.81]This boat is breakable.
[108:39.19]This should do the job.
[108:45.39]Okay, where's that net?
[108:47.23]It's right here.
[108:55.45]It said I could climb it.
[109:01.72]I got it.
[109:05.06]Gotta take a dump.
[109:07.90]Fuck, I didn't parry.
[109:10.26]Ain't that a kick in the head.
[109:35.67]Can I stab with this?
[109:42.11]I... This dude's completely brainless.
[109:58.37]Yeah.
[109:59.53]One, two, three, four down there.
[110:04.54]I'm still standing here.
[110:13.39]I meant the NPC.
[110:14.85]Oh.
[110:15.83]Sorry.
[110:16.29]Everything is a personal attack on the streamer.
[110:19.89]Don't you understand?
[110:21.45]I'm constantly on the defensive.
[110:25.83]You know, like I look over and just be like, oh, nice mustache.
[110:28.15]And it's like, what are you talking about my mustache for?
[110:30.12]What, you did it?
[110:31.22]Does it not look filled in?
[110:32.66]What's wrong with it?
[110:34.04]Is that somebody making a joke about my mustache?
[110:35.62]And it's like, no, dude, the guy with the mustache that you just walked by.
[110:37.96]It's like, oh, right.
[110:38.94]Sorry.
[110:39.32]Sorry.
[110:44.03]I need health.
[110:51.35]Whoa, nice try!
[111:12.74]What are you?
[111:13.22]Okay, yeah, guys.
[111:14.46]Trying to kill me.
[111:15.20]This thing's broken.
[111:17.40]I probably shouldn't be hitting people with the guns.
[111:21.15]I'm coming to terms with this right now.
[111:28.46]Could've killed you.
[111:33.38]Best you just lie there and bleed.
[111:42.24]Get rid of this guy this one dude you suck shoot him Oh
[112:10.63]I want to see what's up here.
[112:12.31]Is this like Dark Messiah?
[112:39.80]Yeah, you, it's, I, you could, yeah, I could, yeah.
[112:51.86]Did I do it?
[112:59.24]What is that doing?
[113:05.65]I don't know.
[113:06.41]It did something.
[113:11.09]It did something.
[113:15.39]Cargo door?
[113:18.05]Was this not open before?
[113:20.40]Maybe it wasn't.
[113:21.06]Okay.
[113:33.53]Zaxximony?
[113:45.21]I have no weapons.
[113:45.93]I'm not going down there.
[113:56.14]Ooh.
[113:58.14]Okay, that's at least something.
[114:25.25]Ooh, here we go.
[114:27.93]That's good.
[114:30.27]Good, good, good.
[114:31.35]Oh, thank goodness.
[114:34.62]I was taking both.
[114:36.34]All right, we're back in business, I would say.
[114:55.86]Ooh, I lost that gun.
[114:59.03]Shit.
[114:59.85]Captain's log.
[115:01.85]We've set sail, but we arrived... A week has passed since we arrived and we're still... It was inevitable, I suppose, given the circumstances.
[115:11.98]Okay.
[115:13.84]Okay.
[115:26.63]I don't think there's anything else.
[115:31.92]I did everything.
[115:34.38]I didn't go back here, though.
[115:41.59]I would rather have this.
[115:45.89]Hmm.
[115:49.66]I got the key.
[115:50.62]Control room key.
[115:51.70]So I have the key to the control room now.
[116:26.74]So the control room.
[116:33.95]Where is that?
[116:37.79]Not up here.
[116:38.31]Not on here, right?
[116:44.47]Stretch break.

[116:54.12]Oh my God.
[116:54.58]Oh my God.
[116:54.98]I haven't saved in a while.
[117:03.45]They're dead.
[117:03.85]Where's the net?
[117:18.15]Shit.
[117:28.38]Come on.
[117:28.68]I know I can do it.
[117:29.36]This is a challenge right here.
[117:30.36]I know.
[117:31.60]Trust me.
[117:31.92]I'm totally capable of doing this.
[117:52.61]We're good.
[118:08.14]Whoa!
[118:08.34]Dude!
[118:08.48]What the fuck are you doing?
[118:33.50]I got him.
[118:37.46]I can't go in this tiny door?
[118:38.48]Hmm, okay, I can go over there.
[118:52.85]Thank goodness.
[118:57.91]So glad I came up here.
[119:02.55]Why is it broken?
[119:11.85]I'm gonna get hurt doing this.
[119:15.08]Okay.
[119:22.24]These levels are a lot more intricate than I thought they were gonna be.
[119:24.68]There's a lot of different ways to go.
[119:27.00]Okay.
[119:43.96]Oh, it's the control room.
[119:46.98]I think?
[119:56.94]Glad I saved it.
[120:00.72]We never stretch.
[120:01.60]We'll stretch right after this, I promise.
[120:09.24]Shit.
[120:16.12]Okay, don't stand right on top of it.
[120:18.09]What was that noise?
[120:22.57]Something ain't right.
[120:24.67]How would I drop in here?
[120:25.81]Aren't I one of the beams?
[120:34.10]I know I heard something.
[120:35.94]I ain't crazy.
[120:38.74]I must have had another stroke again, I guess.
[120:45.17]Don't press that button!
[120:49.01]Is this gonna hurt me?
[120:55.81]That was invisible!
[121:15.83]Alright, let's do it!
[121:17.05]What'd that do?
[121:19.89]Power?
[121:56.24]Can I jump over there?
[121:57.66]I think so.
[122:00.24]Hey, I made it!
[122:07.21]Power station key.
[122:29.52]I did it.
[122:29.86]OK, I gotta go back to where I started.
[122:34.82]Good luck having me remember anything.
[122:54.46]Good place for a stretch break.
[122:56.22]Yeah, I think I'm about to beat the mission so we'll do it right after.
[122:59.59]Alright, go, go, go!
[123:01.39]Go!
[123:01.67]They're firing!

[124:36.14]I was trying to do a running punch.
[124:38.27]What the fuck?

[125:44.79]This is not the right way in.
[125:49.20]Whatever, I got through it.
[125:56.04]I don't have the key for this either.
[126:12.86]It's gotta be this watch this ready.
[126:16.00]Check this out.
[126:19.94]Don't tell me there's nothing back here.
[126:25.48]Really, there's not like a ammo box or something.
[126:29.90]Alright, well, I'm gonna leave.
[126:34.67]And leaving is, um.
[126:39.39]I don't remember.
[126:43.67]In here?
[126:44.11]Oh, yeah, right in here.
[126:49.49]Was it a trap?
[126:50.30]Oh, no.
[126:50.64]Shit, shit, shit.
[127:13.82]Cool.
[127:19.16]So why don't you just do everything?
[127:21.48]Can I be the guy on the radio?
[127:22.56]I feel like we're in wrong roles.
[127:41.59]That's my favorite one.
[127:48.10]I'm gonna stretch during the cutscene.
[128:08.98]Artistic, realistic.
[128:34.76]Waltz was on that list.
[128:36.10]It's in the title.
[128:37.14]And now you are looking for Waltz before he gets Clint?
[128:42.31]I was.
[128:43.97]Not anymore.
[128:47.51]Shit.
[128:49.45]So much for my hazard bonus.
[128:57.84]so where to whatever got victor and the others killed yo mr white watermelon on tv is that a meme I don't know I don't even know I know that's supposed to be guessing you just ruined them I'm sorry I'm stretching back here
[129:28.00]Looks like we have a change of plans.
[129:30.01]Hold on.
[129:41.70]Persistent bastards, aren't they?
[129:43.75]Sit tight.
[129:44.39]I'll try and shake them loose.
[130:11.41]I don't know how I got here.
[130:15.73]I'll talk about it later.
[130:16.97]Let's get him!
[130:37.80]Okay.
[130:38.60]I am sitting back down.
[130:40.32]Let's see.
[130:40.86]Hostiles pacified 17.
[130:43.32]42 killed.
[130:43.58]Secrets found.
[130:43.98]2,110.
[130:44.04]2,110.
[130:44.10]And then I found 5,100.
[130:44.80]That is only funny here.
[130:45.64]Yeah.
[130:45.80]Yeah.
[131:07.22]No, no, you sit tight.
[131:09.22]No, I'm sending a guy down there.
[131:11.83]Yeah, his name's Mike.
[131:14.19]Yeah, don't worry, Blake.
[131:16.59]We'll handle it.
[131:19.45]A little visit to Walt's house will have to wait.
[131:22.86]Not that it matters.
[131:24.26]Car's shot to hell.
[131:25.64]It's gonna take hours to get there on foot.
[131:29.28]What's the good news?
[131:31.05]An old friend of mine could set us up with a new car.
[131:33.81]Just one problem, though.
[131:35.39]Seems our gangster friends are laying siege to the old junkyard he works out of.
[131:39.07]I need you to get him out of there.
[131:42.31]Christ never ends.
[131:43.57]Fine, what am I doing?
[131:45.89]The fastest way to get there is by taking the subway to Maricord Street Station.
[131:49.91]Once you arrive, make your way to the junkyard and assist Blake in any way you can.
[131:54.58]I'd come with you, but... The arm?
[132:00.89]I cannot do a voice this low.
[132:02.15]Um... I feel like... I mean, making like a doctor's appointment like that... I mean, if you can talk that la- is... Yes, I'd like... I'd like to make an appointment, please.
[132:35.32]This is, effectively, this is me doing that.
[132:40.62]As you can tell, it's very frail.
[132:43.56]It's not.
[132:44.46]I just can't do it.
[132:45.18]My diaphragm's not good enough.
[132:46.26]I can't do it.
[132:49.53]Oh, what I was going to say.
[132:50.89]So, I don't know how I got there, but it just made me think about the thing.
[132:55.73]Oh, haha, Jerma laughs at the cars crashing, right?
[132:59.27]Like, that's like a meme, right?
[133:01.31]Oh, haha, every time the car... It's not necessarily true, but...
[133:04.64]Don't ask me how I got here.
[133:07.64]But like, it's kind of proving that right.
[133:10.81]Because I'm not kidding.
[133:12.15]I don't know how I got there.
[133:14.53]But on YouTube, I stumbled upon a one, I think it was like a one or two hour cars driving off the overpass.
[133:25.41]And I think GTA 4.
[133:26.87]And it's just the whole video is just cars driving off the overpass because somebody is blocking it.
[133:34.93]This video is like two hours long.
[133:38.11]And I'm not kidding.
[133:38.85]I laughed at the first five minutes.
[133:41.19]I was like, why is this?
[133:42.83]What is this?
[133:43.65]Why is this video here?
[133:45.27]It's just hours.
[133:50.76]And I was like, God damn, that's so funny.
[133:56.32]Just its mere existence was chuckling to me.
[134:05.25]It's the algorithm.
[134:06.21]Alright, so where are we?
[134:10.07]Here we go.
[134:10.65]I gotta get a car.
[134:11.31]Alright, get a car.
[134:13.07]Drive the car back.
[134:13.95]You got it.
[134:15.33]After three.
[134:25.07]You really should have clarified GTA earlier.
[134:34.00]Did I not?
[134:35.54]Wait, did I not clarify?
[134:37.72]It was a GTA 4 video?
[134:39.32]Yeah, I did.
[134:43.92]No, I did not.
[134:49.36]Okay, well, I'm talking about in GTA 4.
[134:54.27]Alright, I gotta kick some butt.
[134:56.59]So give me a second.
[135:03.69]Nice duck!
[135:05.27]Too bad it's not going to save you.
[135:13.70]Stop stabbing me!
[135:14.64]That's unfair!
[135:15.38]I have no health.
[135:28.95]They took everything.
[135:33.74]Yeah, I'm fine.
[135:35.52]I'm sorry.
[135:37.42]I really am sorry Peter.
[136:06.23]I don't even know where I'm going.
[136:24.20]Hey!
[136:30.05]Ooh!
[136:34.83]It's only one- I've got $144!
[136:35.55]Out of stock?
[136:56.72]I hear twinkling.
[136:58.36]50!
[136:58.38]50!
[136:58.40]Did you guys see the 50?
[137:29.08]That diving shit, why can't I do that?
[137:36.10]You won't come fight me down here.
[137:39.22]You all, all of you won't come down here.
[137:49.41]Don't come, don't fight me down here!
[138:04.72]I want to see.
[138:06.11]We need to see it happen, right?
[138:07.61]That guy just fucking killed me because I'm trying to have somebody get hit by a frame.
[138:17.17]I don't even know where the save is.
[138:24.92]Get away from that civilian!
[138:55.27]I'm sorry, citizen.
[138:56.47]Leave everything to me!
[139:00.19]Hmm.
[139:24.81]Wanna go do a shitload of drugs?
[139:27.65]Oh, uh, uh, hello.
[139:30.55]Okay.
[139:30.83]Hey, nice thigh.
[139:36.20]Like, should be all up in the garage nearby.
[139:39.66]The Panettos and the glasshards have been carving out the neighborhood as part of their turf war.
[139:44.18]Panettos on one side, glasshards on the other.
[139:48.74]And your friend ended up right in the middle.
[139:51.42]Real shit sandwich.
[139:55.42]Alright, get to the junkyard.
[139:56.60]You got it.
[139:56.94]That was a bad view.
[140:09.35]I'm looking for food, honestly.
[140:15.26]I'll take an apple.
[140:17.94]I would like a full banana, not a peeled one.
[140:30.21]Like that.
[140:30.63]Okay, let's go.
[140:43.60]You can open the trunks of some cars, can't you?
[140:49.74]Oh no.
[140:50.28]$50 reward.
[140:52.85]That might be real.
[141:04.09]That guy has a gun.
[141:09.39]Why is it broken?
[141:33.41]They all have guns now.
[141:34.71]Oh shit, that guy's got a knife!
[141:36.67]Oh my god, they're shooting!
[142:05.78]Oh my god!
[142:07.32]This is not safe.
[142:13.05]Come shoot me!
[142:18.57]Fuck!
[142:22.91]I don't think I'm supposed to go in here.
[142:35.47]I think it's supposed to go around.
[142:36.43]It does say keep out.
[142:40.71]Alright, this time I gotta be prepared.
[142:42.58]No more messing around.
[142:43.92]I'm going in and I'm gonna get the... I'm gonna go for it.
[142:47.10]Here we go.
[142:47.36]He hit the guy in the back of the head.
[143:08.57]Okay.
[143:09.53]Food?
[143:09.77]Something?
[143:12.21]Nope.
[143:13.93]Okay.
[143:37.11]So I gotta sneak around the other side then.
[143:40.91]Maybe I just gotta be good?
[143:41.67]Just get better?
[143:44.16]Is there a hole I can sneak through?
[143:51.56]Maybe I just have to be stealthy.
[143:53.00]I think I have to just get good at the video game, right?
[144:05.38]This is an oil barrel.
[144:06.58]I have an idea.
[144:15.01]Watch out.
[144:15.65]Oh no, I'm here.
[144:17.01]I'm here and I'm very, very dangerous.
[144:19.97]Everybody should follow me.
[144:20.99]You should all follow me with your weapons.
[144:24.05]What are you going to do?
[144:24.85]Oh my God.
[144:32.19]Fucking Looney Tunes character.
[144:42.16]That did nothing.
[144:43.78]That didn't even hurt one person.
[144:53.21]My plan was to throw the oil can at the fire can.
[145:06.12]Could have killed you.
[145:07.62]Best you just lie there and bleed.
[145:10.12]I think I just kind of cleared it even though I'm probably not supposed to do it that way.
[145:12.46]I would love to get one of the guns.
[145:19.17]I wish I could... Can you repair stuff?
[145:41.34]Actually, I might need this.
[145:42.52]Let me put this away.
[145:43.22]That's better.
[145:50.20]Alright, am I going in there?
[145:51.26]Am I going to go... Let's go into... I feel like this... Can't get in there.
[145:59.29]This is very... This is so dangerous.
[146:01.21]This is the dumbest thing I've ever done.
[146:04.57]Alright, we have to go find food.
[146:20.30]I try to be actually stealthy.
[146:21.76]Huh?
[146:27.62]Huh?
[146:28.44]I think I see something right over there.
[146:29.84]Is somebody fooling around?
[146:31.89]This guy makes me look so handsome.
[146:52.80]Where's his gun?
[146:55.42]The gun definitely isn't broken.
[146:56.54]Where is it?
[147:01.17]Shit, maybe it is.
[147:01.75]Oh, he's unarmed.
[147:09.92]Okay, right.
[147:23.44]Go up.
[147:27.89]Make sure you get a bird's eye view so you can see more of the map.
[147:31.77]Get a bird's eye view.
[147:32.95]Okay.
[147:35.41]I think I can go up.
[147:43.92]Well.
[147:53.04]Dumpster?
[147:53.40]Shit.
[148:06.22]I don't have the key to get in there.
[148:26.07]Body armor?
[148:29.51]Come on, there's got to be, like, here's my code to get in.
[148:33.84]Bolt cutters, lockpicks.
[148:35.82]Rope, okay.
[148:36.90]Rubber tubing.
[148:40.28]What's the significance of that?
[148:41.36]I can't open this.
[148:50.59]I gotta be able to... Oh, wait.
[148:53.73]There's a code here.
[148:58.73]Is it a clue for the code?
[149:04.59]Bolt cutters, lock picks, rope, tarp, flyer, cement mix.
[149:08.62]I have no idea what any of that's supposed to mean.
[149:10.12]362.
[149:15.66]Oh.
[149:15.74]Bro.
[149:15.84]What?
[149:16.00]Hmm.
[149:30.23]Oh my goodness gracious.
[149:33.95]We don't need this shit anymore.
[149:34.99]Pistol.
[149:39.64]Magazine.
[149:40.16]Alright, we gotta get rid of this stuff.
[149:45.10]There's so much stuff in here.
[149:47.54]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[149:51.10]Reset it.
[149:51.62]Where's the reset?
[149:52.92]Where's the reset?
[149:53.49]I was trying to toss it.
[149:54.59]Not... Okay.
[149:56.25]This game has a drop and this game has a throw.
[149:59.45]And sometimes it's... It's the other click I fucked up.
[150:02.87]And I don't know how far away is it.
[150:07.11]I'm doing it.
[150:08.31]There was so much stuff in that other room.
[150:12.41]I had to.
[150:13.71]It was an entire store worth of stuff.
[150:18.33]OK, so I wonder if I can take less damage falling.
[150:24.09]Look at that.
[150:25.41]Hold on a second.
[150:37.88]Woo hoo.
[150:38.42]Woo hoo.
[150:39.82]OK.
[150:48.91]What about right here?
[150:53.13]Any more food to eat?
[150:56.43]No.
[151:00.16]Hmm.
[151:06.64]Yeah, I'm going to get rid of all this stuff.
[151:08.88]Because we're about to replace it all with a gun.
[151:15.07]Hmm.
[151:19.35]All right, 362.
[151:20.85]There we go.
[151:30.42]I got a lot of money now.
[151:33.98]Silver cigarette case.
[151:35.84]That was $150.
[151:36.12]Holy shit, what do I do with all this money?
[151:39.46]I have a lot of money.
[151:50.72]OK.
[151:53.24]Now look at all this.
[151:54.60]10 bucks that I wouldn't have before.
[152:00.23]Oh man, there's a nail gun.
[152:06.29]Is there shotgun?
[152:07.01]I don't see a shotgun.
[152:14.32]Hammer.
[152:23.53]Well, as much as I love the shotgun, I think I'm going to have to go with the nail gun and I don't have any reloads for it, but only five shots in this thing.
[152:40.36]15 shots total versus yeah, whatever.
[152:44.08]Let's go for it.
[152:57.68]See if I can get through this in stealth.
[152:59.40]I made it to the bathroom.
[153:12.19]Now what?
[153:39.67]Wait, that's not a bad guy.
[153:41.21]Oh, my God.
[153:41.94]I just heard something.
[153:44.22]Say, you boss.
[153:45.98]Who's throwing shit?
[153:48.24]Must have been nothing.
[153:50.54]There's no applause for the loser, you know.
[153:57.19]And so is my chance.
[153:58.97]And so is my chance.
[154:00.13]God, I would have been a superstar.
[154:06.07]I'm getting hungry.
[154:07.53]Need a bite soon.
[154:17.50]That wasn't a civillian, right?
[154:18.58]It's kind of effective.
[154:46.38]Got a lot of stools in this bar.
[154:47.88]I could do this all day.
[154:48.67]Oh, who's there?
[154:54.95]Oh, no, no.
[154:56.15]It's been nothing.
[155:00.11]Oh, no, no.
[155:04.16]Oh, no, no.
[155:09.18]How is he still alive?
[155:10.60]This new sticker.
[155:12.94]Hehehehe.
[155:16.57]Okay, that guy's dead.
[155:17.13]Oh, they're making them get up.
[155:19.53]He's running away!
[155:47.54]What happened to my gun?
[155:51.24]What happened to the gun?
[155:52.58]What happened to the gun?
[155:54.28]Where's my gun?
[155:55.10]No, no, no.
[155:55.42]Like, honest to God, where's my gun?
[155:59.32]I threw it.
[156:24.99]I don't think you... Don't go in here.
[156:31.25]Honest to God.
[156:32.49]No, honest to God.
[156:35.57]Yeah, that's part of my... Like, if you pulled the string in my back, that's one of the seven famous lines you would hear.
[156:42.56]Go on.
[156:53.49]I would... That's not a place to be.
[156:57.98]That's not how fucking pool works.
[156:59.90]Okay, cool.
[157:00.38]What can I do for you?
[157:01.46]Uh, thank you.
[157:02.06]I completed the quest.
[157:23.79]Let's give me your cigarettes.
[157:26.21]Ooh!
[157:26.39]Interesting.
[157:26.81]But... But, look!
[157:52.92]What?
[157:53.04]What do I do?
[157:53.68]There's so many things!
[158:00.01]I want it.
[158:02.64]Trade the nail gun for the shotgun?
[158:04.00]But at least we can play around with it for a second.
[158:35.97]Cool.
[158:47.50]Okay, now I'm able to pick up this.
[158:52.30]This only has two bullets.
[158:59.87]Alright, I'm going to do this and then I'm going to get rid of this.
[159:07.84]And we're going to use this for the boss, OK?
[159:13.41]OK, I need to get.
[159:24.59]Where am I going?
[159:25.11]The junkyard?
[159:25.81]I got turned around here.
[159:28.19]I don't know what direction I'm supposed to be going.
[159:37.32]There were more shells at the... That's right, the ammo shop with the shells.
[159:40.27]That's right.
[159:40.75]I'll do that.
[159:41.39]I gotta remember how to get back up here, though.
[159:47.61]Pretty sure I know.
[159:48.21]It's in the bar.
[160:06.40]Okay.
[160:15.54]Absolutely wonderful, cool.
[160:25.49]Have a good day.
[160:26.77]And I'll use this up and throw it.
[160:37.63]It's over here.
[160:39.75]Here into this room looks like this is like apartment or something.
[160:45.71]There's this one and then there's this one.
[160:48.67]This one.
[161:02.19]What do you do with money?
[161:03.13]Because I have a lot of it.
[161:04.49]That was $500.
[161:18.36]Nice.
[161:19.92]Okay.
[161:21.90]I'm just going to use this thing.
[161:24.60]Yeah, fuck it.
[161:28.28]Who should I snipe?
[161:36.69]This guy.
[161:39.55]Ain't so tough now, are ya?
[161:47.72]Okay.
[161:48.92]I think I've done as much as I can.
[161:54.23]I think.
[161:58.19]I'll keep the shot.
[161:58.89]I'll keep the... Yeah, I'm going to keep all this.
[162:02.80]Really?
[162:03.06]I need four inventory slots.
[162:22.17]Alright, so junk.
[162:24.61]Okay, I think I can.
[162:25.49]Yep.
[162:34.54]If he didn't stop moving, I would have got him.
[162:41.05]There's more bullets back there.
[162:41.93]I can get them.
[162:56.80]Give me the bullets.
[163:02.26]Hey, dude, I played your black and white VOD at my house party a couple days ago.
[163:05.60]It was a hit.
[163:18.01]Well, I'm glad it was a hit.
[163:30.89]Nobody said that.
[163:31.91]Yes, they did scroll up.
[163:33.85]Use your mouse scroll.
[163:34.81]You'll see it.
[163:36.31]OK.
[163:45.02]I think I got pretty much everybody.
[163:48.26]Watch there be a sniper that I'm supposed to have used this on and I just don't seem at all.
[163:56.81]As the junkyard.
[163:57.53]Nobody else.
[164:01.95]OK.
[164:02.19]Is it going to hurt?
[164:11.74]How bad is this going to hurt?
[164:17.66]Oh wait.
[164:24.24]It's dangerous, but OK.
[164:26.81]It worked.
[164:32.69]He doesn't know?
[164:33.25]Why is that?
[164:41.96]Sniper's to your right.
[164:44.68]Oh, wait.
[164:46.06]Did you actually just spoil it?
[164:47.44]I don't think there is a sniper.
[164:55.73]I see somebody there, though.
[165:04.21]and somebody there and somebody there and somebody I have no more bullets I don't want to let this go I didn't mean to press this I don't think I have a use for it anymore
[165:49.34]So don't run as fast as I can everywhere, OK?
[165:58.68]Is out here.
[165:59.34]Ooh, another wallet.
[166:02.28]There's only $1.
[166:02.90]You're going to put a $1 wallet out here.
[166:06.18]That's just bait to have somebody walk out here and die.
[166:17.39]I'm pretty sure everybody that was a threat is gone.
[166:21.79]So I think I can just walk in.
[166:24.46]Chapter three complete.
[166:25.36]I think there's only one or two more chapters left.
[166:28.02]In the current early access gameplay.
[166:34.30]I like it though.
[166:35.12]I think it's fun.
[166:38.12]Oh, that's a booby trap.
[166:39.20]Don't touch it.
[166:57.91]That didn't doesn't trip it.
[166:59.59]Why not?
[166:59.97]How do I open that gate?
[167:11.84]What do I do?
[167:16.03]Useful.
[167:20.03]Maybe in the actual gas station.
[167:28.30]I'm scared to pick this up.
[167:29.88]Okay.
[167:31.34]I didn't know if I was going to pull it across the wire.
[167:33.26]I hear a twinkle.
[167:40.47]I do.
[167:40.75]There it is.
[167:41.03]Ooh, 20 bucks.
[168:01.66]What's the fuck?
[168:04.76]What's going on?
[168:08.84]What is happening?
[168:09.54]Why are they fighting?
[168:10.54]It took so long to reload.
[168:16.02]I'm very confused.
[168:31.25]Did I just throw a... a bullet away?
[168:34.02]I think I accidentally just did.
[168:36.28]Okay, so... Where's this key?
[168:42.22]Hmm...
[169:00.88]Is it rock?
[169:07.00]Where's the key?
[169:12.17]Diner?
[169:19.49]Not bad.
[169:26.70]milkshake strawberry milkshake is probably more important than the shotgun but it's my oh it's my favorite okay well there's no key in here nothing behind strawberry yeah uh you want the the tier list strawberry milk
[169:55.31]is way better than chocolate milk and I'm sorry to offend every single person that's here but very specifically the strawberry nesquik is better than this the chocolate nesquik I know whatever like what what what an opinion that is right damn
[170:18.18]stupid asshole now don't get me wrong I love a nice chocolate milk sometimes you know not all the time sometimes you just feel like it you know what I'd say like a few times a year just like you know what I kind of feel like it how'd you like that yeah maybe a few times a year
[170:47.93]But it inches over the finish line.
[170:51.64]Strawberry milk versus chocolate.
[170:55.08]It's like 5% better to me.
[170:57.58]And not very much.
[170:59.38]Let's say chocolate milk is a 95%.
[171:02.14]Strawberry milk is a 100.
[171:02.80]There's nothing in here.
[171:14.81]Polly is snitching on you.
[171:16.74]What'd I do?
[171:19.19]You drinking?
[171:25.04]Nah, don't believe everything you read, alright?
[171:26.50]Don't believe everything you hear.
[171:27.73]Hey, don't believe everything you hear.
[171:41.94]This is a massive minus two.
[171:44.11]Why?
[171:44.25]Because you don't like strawberry milk?
[171:46.41]Or do you not like me?
[171:47.35]I mean, I'd be either one of those two things.
[171:56.57]I still have not found the key to this place.
[172:03.68]Mailbox?
[172:04.94]No.
[172:05.36]It's definitely back here.
[172:06.84]It's probably in this car.
[172:08.74]It's up there.
[172:11.71]Strawberry milk is disgusting.
[172:19.05]Yeah, fine.
[172:19.74]More for me.
[172:26.60]Look, if every single person at the restaurant says, Oh, strawberry milk.
[172:30.56]Pass it.
[172:31.75]Slide it down.
[172:32.67]Oh, get this away from me.
[172:34.39]Slide it down the bar.
[172:36.11]What is this?
[172:36.97]Strawberry milk?
[172:38.11]Disgusting.
[172:39.17]Slick.
[172:39.99]Slide it down next to me.
[172:42.09]I'm just sitting there and I'm like, holy shit.
[172:43.90]I just got this for free.
[173:10.42]Where's this fucking key?
[173:11.93]No more swearing!
[173:16.83]Where's the key?
[173:19.41]Do I even need a key?
[173:27.94]Oh, it crushes... the car.
[173:33.62]You have to put the car in here... and then you crush the car.
[173:47.09]Alright, I'm alive.
[173:48.88]I'm doing that for a scientific experiment.
[173:58.34]And then we kill the Batman.
[174:00.64]Alright, so how do I move that?
[174:04.95]Yeah, yeah, that's what you do.
[174:06.37]It's right there.
[174:11.01]Please say more swear words.
[174:12.29]I crave them.
[174:19.37]Okay, then we gotta get it in here.
[174:22.03]Can I just pull it?
[174:23.33]How strong am I?
[174:24.01]Where's the ladder that I just climbed up?
[174:30.29]Oh my god, dude.
[174:32.92]Look.
[174:39.42]You know what?
[174:40.08]I'm not going to restart because I deserve to eat this damage because of how bad that was and how stupid that was to try to do.
[174:48.41]I just didn't hit E and I tried to go down it.
[174:52.05]I deserve the pain that I'm having here.
[174:57.69]Okay.
[175:01.50]So now what?
[175:04.70]What do I do with it?
[175:09.61]Just kidding.
[175:17.59]Just like the pain.
[175:18.37]Can we get a pole?
[175:21.61]Do you?
[175:22.05]This guy's alive and just standing here.
[175:25.74]Oh, wait.
[175:28.24]I don't have to do any of this?
[175:38.37]What do you mean I'll open the door for you?
[175:41.13]I was doing this wacky-ass puzzle.
[175:45.78]No, now I need to see this through, because what is this for, then?
[175:56.22]Yeah, hold on.
[175:57.89]Is there another one to move it?
[176:02.77]What's the point of doing that?
[176:10.86]Do you like... Do you genuinely enjoy strawberry milk?
[176:15.82]It's just a yes or no question.
[176:16.91]Open the hood, maybe?
[176:21.25]I don't know what to do with this car.
[176:33.22]But that's for another playthrough.
[176:37.26]I just don't get it.
[176:42.88]answers so far?
[176:45.10]Yeah, it's like 72%.
[176:51.00]That's actually higher than I thought it was going to be.
[176:52.67]I mean, you can do something cool with this, I guess, but I don't know what it is.
[177:02.19]Alright, he opened the door.
[177:05.67]Where's the door?
[177:08.44]I just jumped over it.
[177:09.56]I am so...
[177:17.96]And what can I say?
[177:21.57]These dumb mugs didn't stand a chance.
[177:24.87]Who's the stiff?
[177:26.73]Oh, him.
[177:28.25]He's the punk who started this mess.
[177:30.55]Came in here bleeding like a stuck pig.
[177:33.45]Him and his pals were on the run for those other mugs.
[177:36.15]So do you like it more than chocolate?
[177:37.39]It would be a good idea to hide in my junkyard.
[177:42.14]Chocolate and espresso is what I would rather have than chocolate milk.
[178:05.46]Grab a couple and just put him on a smooth surface and let the tripwire do the rest.
[178:10.72]OK, just be careful not to blow yourself.
[178:14.34]Alright.
[178:17.78]I gotta make I gotta make a make some traps here.
[178:20.65]OK nail gun if I do.
[178:36.78]Okay.
[179:28.41]Come and get us.
[179:31.79]You will never win.
[179:33.29]Oh, they got in the back.
[179:46.38]You know what?
[179:51.51]I don't want to shoot at him.
[180:01.43]Up top nuts
[180:43.43]This thing has too much spread.
[180:44.91]I cannot shoot them if they get close to him.
[180:47.82]That guy just walked in.
[180:48.70]That guy was RP walking.
[180:50.06]Can we do it?
[180:59.20]Thanks for dealing with them crooks.
[181:02.46]I don't know what this city's coming to.
[181:04.95]Threatening a man in a goddamn machine.
[181:08.35]Hope it's fast.
[181:34.59]Can we not talk next to all the gore?
[181:37.47]Yeah, this is kind of a morbid scene.
[181:39.09]I think I'm good.
[182:00.20]Okay, where's the car?
[182:06.35]Uh... You know what?
[182:08.39]I think I'd rather just do this.
[182:13.19]Yes.
[182:15.40]I would.
[182:16.02]Yes, I would like to do that.
[182:19.60]Okay.
[182:19.76]Yes.
[182:32.95]Where's the car?
[182:33.69]It's not this one right here, is it?
[182:34.99]The one that I dropped?
[182:37.21]No.
[182:38.01]Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.
[182:38.91]What did he say it was?
[182:40.26]Go back or something?
[182:45.12]Where's the car, Blake?
[182:45.84]Where's the car?
[182:53.48]In the shed.
[183:02.88]Really?
[183:17.82]Alright, it's time to find out if this game gets one full letter grid.
[183:21.34]Are we about to find out?
[183:23.66]Cutscenes do not count.
[183:26.83]Those of you that may have joined us in the last few months or so, maybe the last year or two.
[183:31.81]If a game has a drivable car, the game gets a full letter grid.
[183:40.98]Shit.
[183:45.78]I don't think so.
[183:55.75]That was pretty badass, but it wasn't me.
[183:57.57]Cool.
[184:02.95]I'm going to stretch during the cutscene.
[184:05.34]Enjoy the show.
[184:07.02]They're bound to leave soon enough.
[184:10.00]I'm going to pee too.
[184:10.72]I'll be right back.
[184:11.74]You're awfully impatient.
[184:13.54]Awfully bored, more like.
[184:14.88]How many we still got down there?
[184:17.73]I count six.
[184:20.31]We just need to sit tight.
[184:22.61]Wait for an opportunity.
[184:26.25]Yeah, well, you're sure taking their sweet old time about it.
[184:30.75]Don't like that.
[184:31.37]A lit cherry is a surefire way to blow our cover.
[184:36.23]Say, you bring anything to eat?
[184:37.41]There's a chocolate bar in the glove box.
[184:42.85]Pretty good.
[184:44.33]More a piece?
[184:45.63]No, I brought my own.
[184:53.48]Sorry.
[184:53.78]Did you want some?
[184:55.52]I'm good, Rufus.
[184:57.70]Heads up.
[184:58.61]Looks like the Prowler is hitting the road.
[185:01.99]Now's our best chance to get in unnoticed.
[185:04.45]Finally.
[185:04.91]Don't know how much longer I could stand smelling that canned slop you got.
[185:09.06]Hold on.
[185:10.16]Hmm.
[185:10.78]More cruisers.
[185:13.56]Something's up.
[185:15.02]That bacon don't smell right to me.
[185:17.18]Shit.
[185:18.90]Looks like we're out of the frying pan.
[185:22.29]And into the fire.
[185:35.44]Another mystery I'm being killed with kindness It's love in the first degree Murder in the moonlight Another robbery
[185:55.38]Someone is stealing my kisses.
[185:59.30]Who'll pay the penalty?
[186:03.34]Circumstances make romances.
[186:07.64]The moon is playing its part.
[186:11.32]Someone's glances and advances takes away my heart.
[186:19.36]Murder in the moonlight.
[186:21.46]I didn't want to start you by yelling very loudly into the microphone.
[186:27.55]Alright, catch me up, what'd I miss?
[186:29.49]The guy ate dog food?
[186:30.74]Nice.
[186:49.90]Alright.
[186:50.60]What do I, what do I, what do I, okay, so I have to, I gotta sneak into this, uh, place.

[187:34.22]Jerma, dog food.
[187:34.86]Did you see the guy ate dog food?
[187:36.75]Jerma, a guy ate dog food.
[187:43.56]Now the game wants me to play with this, so I'm gonna use this.
[188:07.29]Now look at this dude right here.
[188:10.35]Oh, now those are some wheels.
[188:13.29]A Paragon Deluxe Imperial Phaeton S600.
[188:17.30]How about some of this?
[188:21.88]Hey, thanks for coming to the party.
[188:26.98]Oh, shit.
[188:27.52]This other guy's coming.
[188:33.34]Ugh.
[188:38.27]Holy shit, this thing.
[188:39.89]What is this thing?
[189:05.39]Somehow I'm doing not that bad considering what's going on.
[189:08.31]We're good.
[189:10.75]I'll take a giant rock.
[189:55.35]Any other goods?
[190:00.07]Will I find more ammo for this, do you think?
[190:10.69]Well, that's a power drill.
[190:14.19]And there's no way I'm not going to use the... Why would I ever put this down?
[190:23.60]And of course, I'm taking the rock.
[190:38.10]What's it say?
[190:44.23]Can't seem to read this.
[190:46.68]E note.
[190:47.80]Use E note.
[190:50.20]Well, hope it's not important.
[191:09.32]Can't read this either.
[191:10.80]E. I can't read the notes.
[191:16.04]Uh oh.
[191:19.22]Maybe I should reload the game.
[191:37.55]What is this?
[191:47.55]It's like a scary game now.
[191:57.06]Bitch ass all can afford a nice big hug.
[192:22.74]Oh shit, I'm drilling people.
[192:25.88]Whoops.
[192:27.80]What happened?
[192:31.74]Oh, I wasn't supposed to kill anybody.
[192:34.83]Oh no, I wasn't supposed to kill a single person.
[192:40.27]I was the horror movie villain.
[192:43.61]This is a scary game.
[192:45.27]This is so creepy.
[192:49.09]Get over here, I'm gonna fucking drill you.
[192:52.21]I am, it's me.
[192:54.62]I'm the Michael Myers in this scenario.
[192:57.32]What am I afraid of?
[192:58.22]Yeah, I'm just fixing the sink.
[193:03.72]Not killing anybody.
[193:06.04]Pacifist run.
[193:24.69]Holy shit.
[193:27.77]I just picked up something cursed.
[193:32.64]What was that?
[193:33.36]Cursed?
[193:34.26]Also, by the way, don't pick up the red jewel.
[193:55.46]You're gonna get blood in your stool for like six months.
[193:59.96]A good sized button from a man's overcoat.
[194:02.92]Marv's everyday opinion.
[194:05.20]Wait.
[194:09.59]I can't read the notes.
[194:13.97]Jewel uncrusted falcon.
[194:15.93]Right in the piggy bank.
[194:17.43]Mike, we're here for clues, not valuables.
[194:20.96]Listen, the guy's dead.
[194:22.54]He ain't gonna be missing it.
[194:28.80]This thing has no fucking ammo.
[194:34.00]Get rid of it, you idiot.
[194:35.74]I'm walking around with an empty gun.
[194:39.98]I'd rather have a salt shaker.
[194:41.16]Where the hell this thing is?
[194:41.98]Yeah, this is-
[194:58.11]This is gonna be wicked fucked up.
[195:01.34]The twist is... I don't remember doing it.
[195:05.00]And it was me.
[195:07.50]And I seem to know, like, extra details somehow, but it's like, why do I know that?
[195:10.62]It's because you did it.
[195:16.54]Police must have missed this.
[195:18.26]Bit of blood on the corners.
[195:19.96]This wouldn't be left behind by your average hitman.
[195:25.51]Hmm.
[195:27.41]Interesting.
[195:34.73]Footprints lead to the fridge and then they stop.
[195:38.87]Don't seem to be any more footprints anywhere.
[195:41.93]There's two more clues apparently.
[195:43.70]I think I'm gonna have to go upstairs.
[195:55.49]Damn.
[195:55.71]Oh, man.
[195:56.81]Walter was well-heeled, but yeesh.
[195:59.53]Should have asked for more dough when he hired me.
[196:02.34]Focus, Mike.
[196:03.36]You've got a job to do.
[196:04.84]Search around the house for any clues pertaining to the murders.
[196:07.44]Something here.
[196:08.04]Those goons were looking for something, so keep your eyes peeled.
[196:12.70]Another stiff.
[196:13.92]Shot multiple times.
[196:15.98]Seems like he tried to crawl away before the killer finished him off.
[196:33.12]Piano.
[196:43.05]Music notes with 782 circled in red.
[196:46.85]Is there a safe I can open?
[197:18.17]What was it, 782?
[197:18.57]I don't know how expensive that was.
[197:36.19]Ah, diamond.
[197:37.37]2000.
[197:37.39]There we go.
[197:37.64]I can read this now.
[197:49.40]Hey.
[197:51.38]Alright.
[197:54.45]It's nice.
[197:55.73]Yeah.
[197:56.09]So I'm going to be in here.
[198:13.72]Not.
[198:14.85]Got a chalk outline here.
[198:16.35]One of Waltz's bodyguards.
[198:19.21]Blood spray on the wall.
[198:20.23]Why a diamond on the nightstand?
[198:22.17]I don't know.
[198:26.48]That's the kind of shit Robotnik would do.
[198:34.54]Ah, yes, my jewel.
[198:36.35]That pesky hedgehog won't have any idea that it's next to my nightstand.
[198:41.25]And plus, I love how it shines.
[198:46.88]Goku.
[198:56.89]Uh, ooh, office key.
[199:02.71]Shoulder aches worth of each passing day.
[199:08.23]Contacts inform me of this and when I show you some self, which has a wreck crew down at the station.
[199:16.22]Mm-mm-mm.
[199:17.27]Matter with Hector and the others.
[199:19.79]This hunt must be stopped.
[199:20.89]Someone with ties to these gangsters is targeting.
[199:24.79]Okay, well, anyway, that sounds like him.
[199:28.45]I don't even know what I'm laughing at.
[199:34.22]I'm just a fucking weasel.
[199:37.12]I am the guys in this game.
[199:40.16]I'm coming to a really weird realization here.
[199:44.30]Okay, so what do you think about this lamp?
[199:49.15]I'd do that.
[199:50.83]I actually am one of these henchmen.
[199:54.49]Silver cigarette case?
[200:31.00]Shower?
[200:31.28]This is going to be probably like a funny soap animation, right?
[200:38.69]Where you like people like can you like does it slip out of your hands or something?
[200:42.81]Does it like does it make a funny soap sound and you hit somebody in the face with it?
[200:47.29]Judging by the height and shape of the body, this must be Waltz skewered to the wall.
[200:53.59]Seems pretty personal.
[200:55.32]Killers gotta be real strong to turn a fella into a kebab.
[201:00.95]Looks like signs of a struggle here.
[201:02.59]That is one more parent.
[201:09.24]Critical.
[201:11.72]Clue that I missed.
[201:12.56]Anybody know where it is?
[201:25.30]Bookshelf.
[201:28.87]Bookshelf.
[201:31.35]Hey, that's an interesting button now, isn't it?
[201:34.31]Oh.
[201:38.29]Uh, okay.
[201:59.02]One more clue.
[202:02.55]It was a bloody handprint by the piano.
[202:05.37]Nothing hits like a good cup of joe.
[202:07.71]Was there?
[202:17.70]Piano room is back here, right?
[202:21.96]Where's the piano?
[202:26.79]Where's the piano?
[202:33.41]Down.
[202:40.17]Who is already in here?
[202:41.15]I think it's right here, OK?
[202:45.86]Oh, it's the music notes.
[202:52.48]And a handprint, no fingerprints.
[202:55.54]Killer was wearing gloves.
[202:57.46]Height and angle of the hand tells me the killer was a dude.
[202:59.83]He ate dog food 511.
[203:00.73]No way.
[203:03.94]This horror show's starting to make my skin crawl.
[203:07.53]Someone broke in here and put Waltz on display like a hunting trophy.
[203:11.77]Someone small, strong, and smart.
[203:14.75]Kitty put his artwork up on the fridge for everyone to see.
[203:17.11]He seems pretty proud of himself.
[203:19.76]This isn't out of the mob's playbook.
[203:21.28]We might have to reframe the way we're looking at this.
[203:24.90]Still, we'll ask all those men.
[203:26.92]We're here for a reason.
[203:28.54]Keep searching.
[203:29.54]There has to be something.
[203:39.22]Nice self-portrait.
[203:41.00]How pretentious can you get?
[203:42.26]Alright, then he breaks through.
[203:48.84]He was behind the painting.
[203:51.85]In the same outfit.
[203:54.73]Don't steal that.
[203:55.73]If I ever make a horror game, I'm going to do that.
[203:57.27]Don't fucking steal that.
[203:58.21]I want everyone to understand that I came up with that.
[204:02.31]I came up with that.
[204:02.91]You didn't.
[204:03.19]I just want to make sure everyone knows it.
[204:04.15]If you do it and you put it in your game, I get 5%.
[204:09.64]I mean, you heard it.
[204:10.16]That's a verbal, in the past, auditory agreement that we just have together now.
[204:23.71]Is this an elevator?
[204:26.51]His office is an elevator.
[204:32.85]Well, would you look at that?
[204:47.88]Yeah, and then after he jumps out and scares the shit out of you, if you don't kill him, he says, yeah, I got you.
[204:56.67]Okay, now can you please, for the next person that comes through, could you put the painting back up?
[205:02.91]And it goes back inside of the wall where the hole was.
[205:06.81]And you can put the painting back on there.
[205:09.67]And then if it's in a multiplayer game, your friend can walk in and the same thing can happen.
[205:13.88]Remember, I get 5%.
[205:39.07]I feel like this is just... I feel like I've summoned some of you in Elden Ring and you looked like this.
[206:05.44]Captain Spade.
[206:29.48]Oh shit.
[206:29.86]So they were a band of superheroes.
[207:01.59]Woodsworth and Sons.
[207:08.72]Think I found what they were after.
[207:10.14]Woof.
[207:12.08]This file's got dirt on just about everybody in town.
[207:15.26]Names, dates, addresses, the works.
[207:18.20]Maltz has been getting rather chummy with the Benedetto crime family, it would seem.
[207:22.39]This would make the average Highbinder blush.
[207:28.96]Wait, there's more here.
[207:30.52]Your old ace's pals weren't so squeaky clean either.
[207:33.74]They're all wrapped up in this sour racket.
[207:36.48]They weren't my pals.
[207:38.94]What about that buddy of yours I rescued?
[207:41.94]It's complicated.
[207:43.12]Now, now.
[207:47.44]Uh-oh.
[207:47.74]You wouldn't be leaving with my documents, would you?
[207:52.43]Thomas?
[207:53.41]How did you get this channel?
[207:54.59]Now it's been full of surprises.
[207:59.31]I got one more for you.
[208:01.27]Well, for your friend with the goggles, that is.
[208:05.28]Got this gizmo off a pretty young thing that's been snooping around my nightclub.
[208:09.92]There we go.
[208:11.42]Well, hello, sweetheart.
[208:16.02]Dahlia, that son of a bitch.
[208:20.10]Here's how things are gonna go down.
[208:23.03]You have something I want.
[208:24.75]Yep.
[208:29.78]How about this?
[208:34.21]I'll come down.
[208:38.11]We'll do a little exchange.
[208:41.33]I'll give you a bullet.
[208:44.73]And not just one.
[208:45.57]I'll give you two.
[208:48.60]Two for the price of one.
[208:51.02]How does that sound?
[208:52.84]Punk?
[208:54.22]Oh, he hung up.
[208:56.58]He hung up a long time ago.
[208:57.72]Oops.
[209:00.60]All right.
[209:02.38]I'm just walking out.
[209:07.25]So then now when I actually say that to him, I was so ready.
[209:10.83]My adrenaline's flowing.
[209:11.91]I just said that and it didn't get communicated.
[209:15.29]I'm going to say it to him downstairs and I'm going to be wicked nervous about it and I'm going to fuck it up.
[209:19.93]Why does it always have to be like that?
[209:23.91]Like, huh.
[209:26.33]You took a long time to get here.
[209:29.51]I was waiting.
[209:30.91]But then when you say it actually to the person, it's, you took a long time coming here, man.
[209:35.43]I don't know.
[209:38.83]I'll get you for that.
[209:40.65]That's how it always happens.
[209:41.55]And it's fucking annoying.
[209:45.83]All right.
[209:46.13]How do I get out of here?
[209:47.35]Elevator button?
[209:48.67]Will it still work?
[209:54.45]You practice, you practice everything in the mirror.
[209:57.29]You practice like... Why would the character do this, by the way?
[210:01.95]Why would anybody do this?
[210:15.82]I'm ready to destroy you!
[210:20.74]I gotta keep one for your boss!
[210:25.09]tell him Danny the driller just said fuck I knew I was gonna fuck it up I knew I was gonna fuck it up I got nervous I got nervous I got nervous Danny the driller sent some I don't know
[210:55.67]I can't even do it in a video game.
[210:57.17]What's wrong with me?
[210:58.93]I don't have any ammo.
[211:21.19]I just have to escape.
[211:22.55]This is going to be easy.
[211:29.68]I can't, like, squeeze this.
[211:32.06]Come on.
[211:32.60]What are you doing?
[211:40.58]What are you doing with the toothpaste?
[211:42.02]Shut up, motherfucker.
[211:42.77]I need to be remembered.
[211:43.77]I kill somebody with a fucking thing of toothpaste, they'll be telling stories about me forever.
[212:15.01]You didn't even jump over the box.
[212:16.41]Okay, now I'm pissed.
[212:18.65]Okay.
[212:32.79]Alright, where is he?
[212:36.65]Where are you?
[212:41.31]I didn't save one bullet for the boss?
[212:43.39]What's wrong with me?
[212:59.30]I did save one bullet for the boss.
[213:16.39]Well, now I have a few more, but, um... Is he still in the house?
[213:20.91]Did I somehow cross paths with him and just run away from him?
[213:25.27]I mean, I escaped, didn't I?
[213:26.85]Do I have to go back in and kill him?
[213:29.62]I got out!
[213:30.10]Ah!
[213:48.07]Did I escape?
[213:49.49]Get in the... This... This car?
[213:52.77]No.
[213:59.13]These are both police cars.
[214:04.37]Hmm.
[214:07.06]The car from the very beginning.
[214:12.00]I don't... Oh, okay.
[214:14.78]I do have to go all the way up here.
[214:17.28]I got out.
[214:21.17]No, he didn't, did he?
[214:22.15]Crystal.
[214:24.25]Good.
[214:26.27]More than flame nightclub.
[214:34.15]Don't keep me waiting.
[214:35.65]This is it.
[214:37.61]This is the end of the end of the early access coming up writer.
[214:49.43]Just make him wait a long time.
[214:50.94]That's kind of funny, just don't go.
[215:05.12]Cool.
[215:08.46]Why haven't you mentioned this operative of yours before?
[215:12.04]Well, I have been meaning to introduce you to... Delia Price.
[215:16.63]Ring any bells?
[215:19.04]Ah, I know I've seen this doll somewhere.
[215:22.16]That doll has more in common with you than you realize.
[215:26.53]You're both looking for the same missing woman, Alexia Price, her mother.
[215:30.57]Scratch?
[215:30.93]Good idea.
[215:32.55]Last spotted in that nightclub a few weeks ago.
[215:35.05]Enjoy the cutscene.
[215:35.61]Delia's been undercover, trying to dig up whatever she can of what might have happened to her mother.
[215:40.73]I told her not to go alone.
[215:42.49]It was too damn risky, but she always was hard-headed.
[215:48.19]Glassjaw is not gonna burn his meal ticket.
[215:50.17]At least not until we make good on our end of the deal.
[215:54.01]Even so, I'd be a monkey's uncle if he lets us stroll out of there alive.
[215:59.11]Rescuing this brat ain't gonna be easy.
[216:00.79]I always did like a challenge.
[216:09.30]I am sitting back and down.
[216:19.43]I think this is it.
[216:26.49]This is the last chapter in the... At least I think it is.
[216:31.52]If I survive this night, I'm going to dance a damn jig.
[216:37.29]After five find.
[216:39.17]Elliot, yeah, we're.
[216:48.12]It's him, it's a detective.
[216:49.36]Ooh, got you out of midair.
[217:20.61]Dude, imagine freaking a bat over it.
[217:23.06]Oh my god.
[217:23.92]For one second, I thought my health was critical.
[217:32.20]I thought I was about to die because of the lower right of the screen.
[217:38.20]I was like, what do I need to heal myself with?
[217:47.42]Yeah, I got a special delivery for you.
[217:49.68]All right.
[217:50.70]Why don't you throw open the front door so I can finally give you exactly what's coming to you?
[217:56.02]Oh, yeah.
[217:57.90]And what's that?
[218:14.68]Well, at least now you've got a smile as crooked as the rest of you.
[218:18.86]You just never know when to shut the fuck up, do you?
[218:22.37]Always have something smart to say.
[218:25.01]Alright then, tough guy.
[218:26.31]Why don't I just have my boys take that package off your head?
[218:29.97]And the boys.
[218:34.35]Did I bring the documents with me?
[218:35.93]I feel like that's... Like, why can't we just set up a... I guess we have to do it like this.
[218:41.65]Yes, I can hide in here.
[218:45.99]Just like it in the fucking movies, you have to go with it.
[218:49.16]Once the thing's gone, they're gone.
[219:14.45]Thought I was going in the front door.
[219:15.75]Nope, I'm going in through the bathroom.
[219:24.18]Somebody fooling around.
[219:27.76]Open the door.
[219:28.26]I always find that that trope is so funny too and everything.
[219:36.45]Somebody needing to open a door, like a prison cell, for instance.
[219:40.46]Okay, if you ever need to break out of jail, just make a bunch of noise.
[219:44.64]And then go, oh, my stomach hurts.
[219:47.24]Oh, I'm going to be sick.
[219:49.03]What's going on in there?
[219:50.59]Let me open it up and walk in unarmed.
[219:54.03]It happens in everything.
[220:01.02]I was hoping he was going to open it.
[220:06.99]Oh, man.
[220:09.54]Can I get up there?
[220:13.76]I apologize to whoever's in this room.
[220:21.84]Come get me.
[220:27.00]Come on.
[220:27.28]It has to work, right?
[220:30.07]It's me.
[220:30.77]I'm right here.
[220:31.35]Look.
[220:32.51]Hey, who's there?
[220:41.28]I was kind of hoping that was going to land on his head.
[220:45.42]Okay, well, we're going to the front door.
[220:56.45]I'm just going to run in there like a fucking maniac.
[220:59.02]Alright, here we go.
[221:08.02]That wasn't going to work.
[221:14.74]Oh, he's got his trusty broken bottle.
[221:18.27]I think I can get in.
[221:21.45]Yeah, forget about all this stealth.
[221:25.33]Let's just lure them over here.
[221:27.39]And then I'll be able to hide in... Okay, they're going to turn around.
[221:35.10]Watch this.
[221:47.97]What the hell?
[221:49.39]Why did this turn into a tree?
[221:51.61]Isn't it a gun?
[222:08.18]Pick up a bottle!
[222:21.66]I'm here!
[222:29.22]Where's the boss?
[222:31.37]Hey.
[222:32.15]Tell him.
[222:33.23]Davey the Driller wants to speak with him.
[222:37.35]What are they saying?
[222:50.13]I got in.
[222:55.34]I'm in.
[222:55.78]I'm in.
[222:56.34]Get rid of this!
[222:56.96]Stupid asshole.
[223:28.91]Don't even tell me I wouldn't be able to play fucking Fortnite or anything like that.
[223:31.31]I don't want to hear it.
[223:32.25]That's a dangerous save.

[225:19.57]I'm coming out with a reverse secret.
[225:24.36]Alright.
[225:34.19]We're good.
[225:36.99]Things are good.
[225:46.89]Now that everybody's dead, might as well look around.
[225:48.93]Okay.
[225:50.19]That's some money.
[225:52.24]Two bucks.
[225:54.14]That's how you know I'm here.
[225:55.28]Oh no, that's David the Thriller.
[226:14.86]He's here.
[226:15.64]What the hell was that?
[226:27.30]Somebody there?
[226:29.30]Yeah, I'm here.
[226:32.17]There was nothing, I guess.
[226:34.69]What the hell was that?
[226:38.27]Something ain't right.
[226:42.23]I knew I should stay in bed this morning.
[226:49.28]Open the door!
[226:53.45]Wait, that... Where is he?
[227:01.27]That's weird.
[227:07.89]Two.
[227:08.23]One on the left.
[227:08.73]One on the right.
[227:10.16]One upstairs.
[227:12.32]Okay, throwing knife up there in the head.
[227:13.96]Throw a drill over there.
[227:15.00]Run, sprint, jumping, kick.
[227:16.54]Grab chair, throw it up here.
[227:17.54]He will be getting up at that point.
[227:18.86]Chair will hit him as he stands up.
[227:20.24]The frame, perfect frame that he stands up.
[227:23.24]Grab drill, stick drill down.
[227:28.20]That's a civilian.
[227:28.80]These are civilians.
[227:29.72]These are civilians.
[227:30.56]The one guy I killed was a civilian.
[227:33.66]So I did not do that right at all.
[227:46.26]Is this thing broken?
[227:46.88]There's so many of you.
[227:59.48]There's so many of you.
[228:01.14]I'm gonna shoot.
[228:04.54]Don't shoot.
[228:05.18]He's gonna shoot.
[228:19.77]God damn it, what are you just walking around down here for, man?
[228:22.46]I just, okay, I play on the piano.
[228:37.14]Okay.
[228:55.25]I think there's food here.
[228:59.19]I will definitely take... What?
[229:06.78]Okay, here's a note.
[229:14.02]Although if I played it, it would be pretty bad.
[229:15.58]Okay, so if you were hiding and you heard somebody on your grand piano, like this exact scenario.
[229:24.35]And if I were to play it, it would kind of be like... It would be the wrong notes, kind of.
[229:29.99]I feel like it would be worse.
[229:31.77]Dude, what do I do this to?
[229:33.03]Everybody's dead except for this guy.
[229:54.11]You're alive!
[229:56.31]Oh my goodness.

[231:36.81]What is that?
[231:38.03]Hmm.
[232:05.02]Shotgun ammo, but no shotgun.
[232:10.02]They can't go in there.

[236:00.07]I was trying to talk to him.
[236:02.27]Sleep tight, asshole.
[236:03.91]I just called him an asshole.
[236:04.85]I was actually trying to talk to him.
[236:06.01]I pressed E to talk.
[236:10.81]Okay.
[236:11.49]Oh, hey, look out.

[236:35.66]Adding that to the rainy day fun.
[236:39.96]Can I get to 10 grand before the game is over?
[236:51.91]Something tells me I should bring the gun.
[236:54.94]Alright, I can't.
[236:55.44]This door's locked.
[237:05.29]Huh?
[237:12.41]Huh?
[237:19.61]Shit.
[237:31.57]Somehow you hit that guy in the balls.
[237:33.87]I don't know how, but you did.
[237:37.52]You hit... I don't know how that happened.
[237:51.40]I hear a twinkle.
[237:54.87]Underneath?
[237:55.21]Alright.
[238:07.11]Somebody is shooting.
[238:08.05]Ugh!
[238:10.63]Alright, none of these guns will work.
[238:21.10]Okay.
[238:24.82]Where is this twinkling?
[238:39.65]I can hear it in the ceiling.
[238:44.71]It's like over here somewhere.
[238:46.29]Did I get the glass?
[238:51.59]Ooh, it was the glass.
[238:53.11]Okay.
[238:53.27]Time to find... Okay, uh...
[239:09.17]I think I'm getting close.
[239:21.22]Okay, I'm upstairs now.
[239:27.13]Can't kick it open?
[239:35.77]Well, weird.
[239:36.73]Okay, hold on.
[239:40.39]A lot of little shortcuts.
[240:01.07]Interesting.
[240:08.57]Cool.
[240:16.60]Oh, it's one of these.
[240:17.64]Let's go.
[240:18.76]Okay, there's a torture room.
[240:44.63]Okay.
[240:46.39]Sneaking through my shit.
[240:47.39]Got some suspicions.
[240:48.51]Okay.
[240:49.64]Okay.
[240:58.70]Um... Where do I go from here?
[241:07.08]Oh, damn it.
[241:12.20]You guys are running all the way over here.
[241:27.74]I'm looking for another door.
[241:32.10]It's not all the way out here in a different room, or is it in a different?
[241:35.28]I wonder.
[241:35.62]Maybe up here?
[241:40.99]I got a feeling it's not in the same location.
[241:51.13]Maybe it is.
[242:08.63]Can I not break this?
[242:09.99]Oh, whatever.
[242:15.99]What the fuck?
[242:17.51]Ow!
[242:17.81]Why?
[242:39.32]Damn it.
[242:39.96]No, I have to kill them because they'll get back up and attack me.
[242:43.58]I feel like there's another... Okay, I think it's right there.
[243:03.13]I am trying not... You know what?
[243:05.31]I don't even know.
[243:10.03]Okay, I gotta be ready.
[243:10.67]I'm gonna walk it down here like a Ghostbuster.
[243:27.34]Wait, something over here?
[243:41.88]Stuff?
[243:42.66]Money?
[243:43.90]There's shells here.
[243:44.70]Feel like I might see a shotgun very soon.
[243:55.04]I hear fire.
[244:01.45]That wasn't going to do anything.
[244:06.25]Oh shit, OK.
[244:08.07]Uh, let's go.
[244:12.50]Did I do it?
[244:12.90]Oh, shit.
[244:16.28]Miss Price?
[244:20.72]Took you long enough, new guy.
[244:22.08]Nightwave sent you.
[244:24.40]Ugh, lazy prick.
[244:27.20]Making you and me do all his dirty work.
[244:32.16]I know you can hear me through that calm night- That thing is gigantic.
[244:36.69]I'm sorry, but- Oh, just save it.
[244:42.43]It's not as bad as it looks.
[244:44.33]Been through worse.
[244:45.91]But whatever they injected me with is burning a hole through my brain.
[244:52.27]Don't happen to have any smokes on you.
[244:54.75]That was... That thing was like a brick.
[244:56.89]Yeah.
[244:58.07]Here.
[244:58.31]Oh, shit.
[245:11.23]Ah, you should have seen the look on their faces when they blew my cover.
[245:15.15]I don't think they expected me to plug the three of them and break the other bastard's arm.
[245:20.05]Bad news, Mike.
[245:20.99]A coop just wheeled in out front and now they're swarming the joint.
[245:23.73]So we need to crack some skulls or tiptoe your way out.
[245:26.19]Whatever you do, just get the hell out of there.
[245:29.23]I'm ready to blow this joint when you are.
[245:32.09]It's really good to meet you.
[245:33.29]I, um... I use a drill.
[245:37.13]They call me the Driller.
[245:38.57]I just need to...
[245:40.33]That's my stick.
[245:42.57]What's your stick?
[245:46.30]It was really nice to meet you.
[245:48.40]Sometimes I hold it in the air and I scare people with it.
[245:58.78]Oh my goodness.
[246:02.06]No, no.
[246:02.74]You're not going to make me actually do this, are you?
[246:04.48]No.
[246:11.47]But you can't, right?
[246:13.29]You can.
[246:13.73]Oh no!
[246:19.11]We're gonna get out!
[246:23.06]You're gonna be just fine!
[246:24.32]I thought that was a shotgun.
[246:26.02]Oh.
[246:26.08]Did you really just...
[246:45.01]What happened?
[246:46.61]What's going on?
[246:47.27]Why is everybody so mad at me?
[246:53.91]Why is everybody so mad at me?
[246:57.40]I'm just walking out the fucking front door, alright?
[247:02.98]You think you're gonna stop me?
[247:05.80]Are you shitting me?
[247:11.20]Wait a minute.
[247:16.95]Oh I could have just crawled through.
[247:41.17]No!
[247:46.47]What's going on?
[247:49.61]Am I doing this?
[247:50.85]I have to... Alright.
[247:51.81]I'm sorry.
[247:57.58]Oh my god.
[247:58.28]I just exploded her.
[248:01.06]We're gonna get out.
[248:10.10]I can hear the train.
[248:11.10]We're gonna get on the train.
[248:12.07]What are you gonna do about it?
[248:14.69]I just gotta get to the car.
[248:19.05]Let's get the fuck out of here.
[248:31.08]Distraction.
[248:32.16]Hey, thanks for coming to the party.
[248:39.96]Okay.
[249:01.08]What was that cartoon sound?
[249:08.68]Where is she?
[249:23.31]Smash him in the fuckin' heavens.
[249:28.41]Stop dodging my shit!
[249:29.77]You're fuckin' annoying!
[249:53.09]No!
[249:53.49]Who shot me?
[249:55.71]Who shot me?
[250:10.36]I need him.
[250:18.07]Alright, here we go.
[250:21.47]Who else has a gun?
[250:24.40]You do.
[250:25.74]You piece of shit.
[250:26.90]Okay, hold on.
[250:27.62]I got an idea.
[250:36.30]Holy sh- Oh my fuck!
[250:54.94]Get his gun.
[250:56.02]The guns are always like snapped in half.
[251:08.54]Oh my goodness.
[251:09.16]That went right by my head.
[251:10.06]Okay.
[251:12.76]Oh my god.
[251:13.40]Reload.
[251:18.16]Oh fuck.
[251:20.87]My chest hurts.
[251:26.87]Uh, somebody just wrote, dude, and they really meant it, too.
[251:30.68]Dude, you... You are the worst gamer ever.
[251:36.04]No, dude, no, I'm not.
[251:37.40]Your grandmother is, okay?
[251:39.16]Please.
[251:42.02]Come to papa.
[251:42.84]Oh.
[251:59.35]Why did I think that was gonna work?
[252:00.65]Okay, I have a few opportunities here.
[252:03.59]Don't you talk about my grandma.
[252:07.40]Wait!
[252:12.78]Come on, let's go!
[252:13.42]Hey, I don't see your grandmother doing that.
[252:33.01]And we're out.
[252:43.35]Thank you for getting her out of there.
[252:48.47]You are the worst gamer ever.
[252:50.57]Keep an eye on her.
[252:51.91]She's the only one who can help us get so sincere too.
[252:56.10]That was so long way down.
[252:58.02]It was so sincere.
[253:19.52]You went through more damage being saved.
[253:25.01]Guys, there's a place body down button.
[253:28.61]That's what I was pressing.
[253:29.77]I had to fight the enemies.
[253:35.94]Nobody's running out there.
[253:37.08]All right, I will level with you.
[253:54.13]I did try to throw her out the window.
[253:56.67]That is, yeah, that's true.
[253:58.45]That is absolutely true.
[254:00.80]but it was merely to try to save time in the video game where I was being pursued by enemies behind me.
[254:11.79]Because I didn't think we could fit out the window together.
[254:17.89]That was a lot of fun.
[254:22.80]That was really good.
[254:24.30]I very much enjoyed that.
[254:25.48]That was a lot of fun.
[254:28.78]You threw her at the goon like three times.
[254:30.80]Well, I was just learning the controls.
[254:32.23]I didn't know.
[254:45.70]Stay tuned for updates soon.

[254:50.16]And the level editor.
[254:51.10]You can make your own fallen aces of levels.
[255:02.94]cool that actually felt like there was quite a lot there was that like four hours three four hours of content right now I would say that was fun I don't know how many chapters or how many I guess acts they're gonna be but at least the second one so that was really cool I think that's that's a good place to call it I think that's a good stopping point I like the four hour mark
