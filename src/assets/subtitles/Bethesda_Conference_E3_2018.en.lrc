[00:01.12]Hold on a minute.
[00:02.94]Hold on.
[00:03.20]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:04.10]Hold on.
[00:04.40]Why are they upside down?
[00:05.32]What the?
[00:05.74]Did I do that?
[00:06.26]Did I just do that?
[00:07.16]I don't think I did that.
[00:08.20]Wait.
[00:08.36]Hold on.
[00:08.60]I'll be back.
[00:08.98]Just enjoy this.
[00:09.50]I'll be back in a second.
[00:35.77]I don't know.
[00:36.79]Things we haven't heard of.
[00:37.59]Things we haven't even heard of yet.
[00:38.87]I'm going to pee.
[00:39.45]Just watch this.
[00:40.11]I'll be back.
[00:40.43]So if you see something totally awesome and you just really want to share it, let us know what you think using the BE3 hashtag and follow all the Bethesda channels to stay up to date on your favorite games.
[00:50.22]And there are definitely some big surprises in store for you all tonight.
[00:53.68]Oh, for sure.
[00:55.74]We may have teased a couple new things, but we've always got some tricks up our sleeve.
[01:00.38]Let's take a look back at some of the biggest moments from our past showcases.
[01:05.58]Welcome to Bethesda's first ever 2017 Bethesda E3 Showcase.
[01:08.54]This is Doom.
[01:09.30]This game is coming out on the App Store tonight.
[01:20.56]We will offer you an experience unlike anything else.
[01:49.08]There are very few things as good as falling.
[01:53.78]Tonight, we're announcing one Tamriel.
[01:58.56]We put this show on for you to show the whole world what we're up to and what should be another big year for Bethesda.
[02:08.55]Hey, little fella.
[02:11.76]What are you doing here?
[02:14.82]It's dangerous here.
[02:15.76]You have to be so quiet.
[02:23.11]Abigail, you're fairly new to Bethesda.
[02:25.31]What do you think so far?
[02:26.61]You know, it was really easy to fit in here.
[02:29.33]At first, I was just excited to work with games that I love.
[02:32.21]But now I can come into work every day and see all the friends that I've grown to love.
[02:35.65]Especially you, Anne.
[02:36.96]Aww.
[02:37.84]I mean, the people we work with are the kinds of people who will let you borrow their small dogs so you have something to hold and hug while you're filming a pre-show.
[02:45.24]We really do work with some cool people.
[02:47.56]And we're all working towards one awesome shared goal.
[02:50.30]Creating unforgettable experiences for our fans.
[02:53.47]And that's because we all love games and we all love our communities.
[02:57.45]That's why we put on events like the E3 Showcase.
[03:00.29]We just took a look back at some of the incredible moments from E3s of the year's past.
[03:04.97]And we're just now a few short minutes away from the fourth annual BE3 Showcase.
[03:11.71]And Rudy and Brian are so excited, and so are we, obviously.
[03:18.25]Let's take a look at the Showcase as it was being built.
[04:10.73]We're about to dive into the year to come, but before we do, let's take a look back at the past year.
[04:16.71]Last year alone, we announced and launched... Alright, I'm back, I'm back, I'm back.
[04:21.80]What'd I miss?
[04:22.26]What'd I miss?
[04:23.10]Ow!
[04:23.44]What happened?
[04:24.72]Get off!
[04:25.58]Get off of me!
[04:26.40]Get the fuck off of me!
[04:27.58]Alright.
[04:29.12]What'd I miss?
[04:29.62]Anything else happen?
[04:34.10]It's basically been a non-stop rollercoaster ride of events, launches, and awards with the team at Machine Games winning Best Action Game for Wolfenstein 2 at the Game Awards last year.
[04:45.35]Okay, didn't miss anything.
[04:46.69]Very exciting.
[04:47.57]Several of Bethesda games have also made their way... Hold on.
[04:49.95]I gotta change this.
[04:50.57]We're talking about the Switch.
[04:52.93]I'm so ready to be so excited about this.
[04:55.31]I don't even care about the fucking conference.
[04:56.65]I just want to watch Todd Howard do the thing, the first thing.
[04:59.22]I got three chances here to make like $50,000.
[05:03.19]I'll take those odds.
[05:05.27]I thought somebody was in a call with me.
[05:12.23]I was like, what have I done?
[05:13.35]What are you talking about?
[05:14.59]What have you done?
[05:15.75]The swear words!
[05:17.81]There were swear words allowed on here?
[05:23.62]I thought they were censoring the swear words.
[05:27.36]Hold on, I gotta get my setup ready.
[05:36.62]Okay, I can see now.
[05:37.42]I'm ready.
[05:39.30]Let me get the fucking facecam on here.
[05:40.78]Like, let me get on here.
[05:41.53]Which one is it?
[05:43.95]Where am I?
[05:46.79]Okay, here we go.
[05:52.33]Here for the ship.
[05:54.22]I've been waiting all day for this.
[05:57.26]I'll find out if he can still bleed.
[06:02.28]We gotta sort the fighting spirit back in the American people.
[06:05.27]I don't even want to put the facecam on.
[06:06.59]Why am I doing it?
[06:07.07]Alright, let's get... I got it, I got it, don't worry.
[06:17.18]I'm preparing myself.
[06:24.43]And that brings us back to now.
[06:26.96]Actually, Anne, that brings us to the future.
[06:30.74]True.
[06:31.52]And the future is bright pink.
[06:33.72]We just recently announced two new games that we're going to be talking about on the stage.
[06:37.22]What if this is me?
[06:37.60]What if I was here doing it?
[06:38.42]Just a few minutes.
[06:39.46]Wait.
[06:40.56]Two?
[06:41.48]Yes, Abigail.
[06:42.64]Rage 2.
[06:43.20]But I'm naked.
[06:43.84]Yes.
[06:44.50]Rage 2.
[06:45.82]And the other game is... Not yet.
[06:48.54]Oh.
[06:48.62]Okay.
[06:49.74]No, I'm just pretending to be Nate.
[06:52.81]You want me to keep the facecam on?
[06:56.25]For real?
[06:56.67]Was I going to do this shit?
[07:00.01]Was I going to do this shit?
[07:01.31]That broke.
[07:01.75]I broke it.
[07:02.07]This is your fault.
[07:06.92]I had two in here and it broke off because I was doing it.
[07:09.94]Why are we playing Andrew W.K.? ?
[07:14.65]This game's graphics are amazing.
[07:16.59]What game is this?
[07:18.29]This is like fucking next-gen.
[07:22.30]Holy shit, wow.
[07:23.38]I wonder what they call him this month.
[07:33.00]Mad Max 2.
[07:33.38]What the fuck are we watching right now?
[07:44.61]I feel like that could have been like a Cartoon Network promo.
[07:48.31]If they were cartoons and not real life.
[07:49.63]That was Rage 2.
[07:50.39]But that wasn't even a fucking game.
[07:52.21]I'm crazy.
[07:52.79]My brain doesn't work right.
[07:55.24]What was my delay?
[07:55.68]I shouldn't have a delay.
[08:15.48]Tribes rose up.
[08:18.52]Alliances formed.
[08:21.92]Oh, no, I do.
[08:23.14]Actually, I do have a delay.
[08:23.96]I have, like, seven or eight seconds.
[08:25.10]Oh, well.
[08:25.44]Go back to destroy all humans?
[08:26.48]I mean, we're done with that for tonight.
[08:30.03]We're going to watch this company in the two games that they make.
[08:48.93]I'm not sure, I'm not sure I like this song choice, though.
[08:51.33]Like, fucking Andrew WK.
[08:52.57]This is the preview before the movie, yeah.
[09:04.06]Our feature presentation is coming up here in a second.
[09:17.97]Looks pretty good.
[09:20.51]I never played Rage 1.
[09:21.18]I don't even know what it is.
[09:23.48]I know that it's like Doom, but not Doom.
[09:26.24]It's like Doom and Mad Max.
[09:31.87]Like somebody sneezed on it.
[09:34.64]And, like, Bulletstorm came around and, like, punched him in the balls.
[09:40.22]Alright, is this good enough?
[09:41.12]Let's check.
[09:41.58]I know this cup says K. My real name is Ken, okay?
[09:43.58]I've been lying to you for years.
[09:44.54]Ugh.
[10:00.05]But Bethesda really does provide our communities with pretty much everything they could ever ask for, which must be why we have such incredible and dedicated fans.
[10:08.54]I love Bethesda fans.
[10:09.60]These two people work for Bethesda?
[10:10.56]Is that what this is?
[10:11.22]Those folks out there are ready to party.
[10:13.50]They seriously are.
[10:15.44]And there were definitely a few Fallout fans out there, which is great because we just announced something very exciting.
[10:23.43]Oh, shit.
[10:25.03]I want to get in one of the chairs.
[10:26.23]This is not going to work the way that I think it is.
[10:28.97]I'm just here.
[10:29.37]I just got invited.
[10:45.92]I'm the guy that won the sweepstakes that got to come here and be on camera.
[10:48.56]Let's roll that announce teaser one more time before we finally let you guys get to the showcase you're all waiting for.
[10:54.89]I got it out of the cereal box.
[11:01.63]The Bethesda Fallout cereal.
[11:02.93]I got the thing and I sent the thing in.
[11:04.76]I sent in the sweepstakes code.
[11:09.84]Alright, the face game's going off of this one.
[11:11.52]We gotta see the full.
[11:12.76]Is this even a conference?
[11:13.68]What's happening?
[11:19.06]Every Fallout starts like this.
[11:20.20]They play the funny song and it pans back out.
[11:24.04]West Virginia Blue Ridge Mountains Shenandoah River Don't they all do this?
[11:35.23]Older than the trees Younger than the mountains Back the breeze Country roads
[11:46.37]For when the fighting is stopped and the fallout is settled, you must rebuild.
[11:51.72]Stepping on our toes, once again.
[11:57.64]Microsoft, you fucked up our Congress for like the third time in a row.
[12:06.51]We saw this like two hours ago.
[12:11.49]And I made that really, really good Soldier: 76 joke and I didn't play that fucking game.
[12:24.09]That was scary.
[12:25.57]Give us a fucking warning, man.
[12:27.27]You warn us on that one.
[12:28.43]Say, warning!
[12:30.19]Those of you users that cannot handle snakes jumping out of a can at you, be ready.
[12:34.27]I'm ready.
[12:34.79]Okay.
[12:34.97]We got this.
[12:35.23]Clap.
[12:35.49]Huge inhale.
[12:36.47]Electric guitar.
[12:37.27]Or what was the other one?
[12:38.67]Hey, potty people.
[12:39.07]Okay, I'm ready.
[12:56.66]Let us know what you think.
[12:57.52]What if he does all three?
[12:58.42]And if you're watching on Twitch tonight, you may notice a little something special.
[13:02.16]Like, I get to retire.
[13:02.94]There's a brand new Twitch extension featuring trivia and polls that could get you a free Twitch drop.
[13:08.54]Just link your BethesdaNet account to your Twitch account and load up the extension and you will be eligible for the drop.
[13:14.97]Yay, free stuff.
[13:16.19]Yay.
[13:17.27]And that's it for us.
[13:18.71]Once again, I'm Anne Lewis.
[13:20.75]And I'm Abigail Tyson.
[13:22.55]Enjoy the show.
[13:23.35]Bye.
[13:27.51]RPM.
[13:28.27]Rating pending for mature audiences only.
[13:34.65]I got a countdown.
[13:35.85]A 30 second countdown.
[13:36.96]I mean, you could have done 10.
[13:40.60]This is just extra computer time that you didn't have to do.
[13:47.91]Rich streamer eats well.
[13:51.05]Here we go, come on.
[13:59.81]That's too late.
[14:00.31]I was gonna put my cell phone ringing, but it said no cell phone.
[14:07.21]This is Bethesda.
[14:08.45]Let's see what it- let's see what they are.
[14:11.45]Okay.
[14:14.28]Game development simulation game.
[14:16.24]Coming out.
[14:18.54]The life simulator.
[14:19.48]You can go to do yoga and shit.
[14:24.52]Bethesda's take on The Sims.
[14:26.08]First-person mode?
[14:26.66]VR?
[14:26.74]We come from different backgrounds.
[14:30.59]From different countries.
[14:34.41]We have different interests.
[14:37.43]Okay.
[14:38.25]And different points of view.
[14:39.51]I could do without the, like, credit card commercial, you know?
[14:42.58]We aren't all developers.
[14:45.64]But it takes all of us.
[14:48.16]Every one of us.
[14:49.74]To make these games.
[14:52.25]A job we take very seriously.
[14:59.98]Violence.
[15:00.48]Violence.
[15:00.90]Don't do that.
[15:02.52]Like I was watching a, uh... Never mind.
[15:06.64]We try and break things.
[15:08.26]I'm so excited.
[15:09.14]I can't wait.
[15:10.10]We fix things that are broken.
[15:11.24]I'm such a huge Bethesda fan.
[15:13.19]We keep the teams happy.
[15:14.39]I played... I played... I watched a guy play Fallout for like four hours.
[15:18.03]We keep our fans happy.
[15:22.42]That's cool.
[15:24.62]Here comes the scan of the face, right?
[15:25.83]Any of you guys fucking work?
[15:27.53]Oh, most of all, you know, we like play the fucking drums in the office.
[15:34.25]The game came out unpatched, by the way.
[15:46.98]Games as diverse as the people who make them and play them.
[15:50.56]I'm being like a fucking dick.
[15:52.10]Alright, I'm gonna tone down, like, the dick.
[15:54.66]We're creating it.
[15:56.25]I'm gonna make sure, like, my dick is not, like, so high.
[15:59.35]I'm gonna tone it back a little.
[16:00.71]I need a little small, small dick.
[16:07.68]You can start the show.
[16:14.45]Turn it up?
[16:14.77]Okay, turn it up.
[16:15.45]What was that?
[16:19.21]I don't want to see your neck over here.
[16:34.21]The desert really does love those soundtracks and musical stuff, huh?
[16:45.44]Dishonored is the only one you're looking forward to?
[16:47.34]Are they doing it?
[16:47.88]Is there a new Dishonored coming out?
[16:51.73]Or are they going to re-release that on Super Nintendo?
[16:59.22]Good one, Ken.
[17:02.90]Here we go.
[17:05.60]This is all I care about.
[17:06.42]I don't care about anything else.
[17:07.16]And now, please welcome Bethesda's Global Senior Vice President, Pete Hines.
[17:12.26]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[17:14.36]If he does it, it'll be... I thought he was gonna start doing it.
[17:23.37]I really did.
[17:24.01]I thought he was going like this to pull up a fake guitar.
[17:26.87]Thank you.
[17:29.21]That's two claps.
[17:30.71]Thank you guys very much.
[17:32.43]You sound good.
[17:33.25]I love you, too.
[17:35.58]You look good.
[17:36.70]You guys ready to go?
[17:39.74]As Paula said, my name is Pete Hines, and I'm delighted to be back on stage for Bethesda's fourth annual E3 Showcase.
[17:46.04]Now, we've got all kinds of surprises in store for you tonight, so whether you're here with us in the audience or you're one of the millions who are watching around the world, settle in, get ready for the very best in gaming.
[18:02.70]Our theme this year is Create, and it's a theme embraced by our 10 studios spread around the globe, the incredibly talented folks who make the Bethesda games that you'll soon be playing.
[18:12.73]As you saw in our intro video, it's not just developers.
[18:16.61]Everyone at Bethesda is a part of the team that brings our games to life, and that extends to all of you, because we create the worlds, but
[18:24.85]You create your own adventures, stories, and experiences, and it's your passion for games that drive us every day to strive for excellence.
[18:34.02]That's fucking kind of weird.
[18:37.36]4-0-0-0.
[18:38.60]The past year has been an exciting one for Bethesda as we release some of the best games of 2017.
[18:43.40]Games like Prey, Dishonored Death of the Outsider, The Evil Within 2, Wolfenstein 2, I didn't play it.
[18:55.18]We even released exciting updates for The Elder Scrolls Online.
[18:58.38]We brought full open world VR with Fallout 4 and Skyrim plus Doom VFR.
[19:06.63]And we even released our first two games for the Nintendo Switch.
[19:12.37]So we were thrilled when Metacritic named us the top publisher in the industry with the highest overall VU scores across all of our games.
[19:24.31]But tonight is about the future.
[19:26.33]We're here to show you where we're headed and the games that we're creating that you'll soon be playing, the worlds that you'll be inhabiting in the next year and beyond.
[19:34.32]So, we're starting with a game that we announced a few weeks ago to our friends at Walmart Canada.
[19:40.88]What?
[19:45.34]They sent this to Walmart Canada.
[19:47.15]Perhaps best known for their low prices and ability to keep a secret.
[19:53.57]Oh, that was a leak.
[19:54.47]Okay, that was a leak joke.
[19:55.65]That went way over my fucking stupid ass head.
[19:57.74]Alright, we'll see you in a second.
[20:02.16]I was about... Okay, I was about to end the stream.
[20:04.12]Whoops!
[20:06.90]That was close.
[20:13.18]What the fuck is this guy?
[20:18.37]Oh no, wait a minute.
[20:19.75]Wait a minute, this counts.
[20:23.67]This counts.
[20:24.55]This counts if he does it.
[20:27.53]Come on.
[20:32.36]It counts.
[20:33.02]I don't care if it's not Todd Howard.
[20:38.02]Andrew WK's in the album in like 15 years?
[20:39.79]I can't believe his hair is not white.
[20:49.63]Come on.
[20:49.91]It counts if he doesn't.
[20:55.37]God damn it, he's got a keyboard, not a fake guitar.
[21:05.30]There's been all these, like, old men in this audience that are just like...
[21:14.54]What a great crowd.
[21:15.26]We're all just sitting here with our phones out.
[21:44.28]Didn't it say, wait, wasn't there a thing on the screen that said, do not take your cell phone out?
[21:48.06]Everybody fucking has their cell phone out.
[21:49.98]All of them.
[21:50.94]Look at how many cell phones in the audience are going like this.
[21:53.50]It said, please no cell phones.
[21:54.86]They did the movie, pre-movie theater thing where the popcorns are dancing around and the soda gets spilled and you see all the crackles and all the Sprite soda shit that pops up and makes you want to have a soda.
[22:04.99]They did that.
[22:09.01]Yeah, all these people are going to prison immediately after this show.
[22:13.77]I hope he does like a two-hour concert.
[22:19.25]Imagine he does like 15 songs.
[22:21.27]Do the whole thing.
[22:30.47]Do like eight songs.
[22:32.00]Do it.
[22:41.80]They're all Todd Howard clones anyway.
[22:54.34]Exactly what I was talking about.
[22:55.82]That is exactly what I was talking about.
[23:02.16]Dude, there are like fucking 3,000, 4,000 people in this crowd.
[23:05.20]You can't find one guy that's excited?
[23:07.94]I know the people left and right are probably really annoyed by this guy, but like at least find the one guy that's not sitting there with sunglasses with his fucking eyes just probably closed, sleeping.
[23:21.83]I told you.
[23:40.40]90% of everybody there.
[23:41.21]Alright, let's see Rage 2.
[23:42.19]That only costed us $245,000.
[23:46.23]Is that Andrew W.K.
[23:48.81]again?
[23:49.13]Andrew W.K., the perfect song for Rage 2.
[23:54.03]Oh, and by the way, that's my little brother, Andrew W.K.
[23:58.51]I'm Bob W.K.
[23:59.73]My name is Tim Willits, and I am the studio director at id Software.
[24:04.12]And I'm Magnus Nedvors, game director at Avalon Studios.
[24:07.78]This guy's huge.
[24:10.52]And we're here to say that rage is back.
[24:18.19]I'm excited.
[24:18.61]We had a ton of crazy ideas when we started planning Rage 2.
[24:25.00]And we needed the right studio to bring our vision to life.
[24:29.30]I thought that was a Rolex for a second.
[24:30.50]That's not even close.
[24:31.70]It's not gold.
[24:32.30]It's fucking pink.
[24:33.78]I was like, oh, nice Rolex.
[24:34.86]Only watch I know is Rolex.
[24:36.32]Only one.
[24:37.06]And as we're about to show you, they delivered big time.
[24:41.73]Alright.
[24:44.03]Is this guy like seven feet tall?
[24:47.15]What?
[24:49.01]That's a good talk.
[24:53.35]Well, thank you, Tim.
[25:00.19]This is a little weird.
[25:05.07]Yeah!
[25:06.89]Off script.
[25:08.11]He's going off script.
[25:12.23]Well, speaking for everyone at Avalanche Studios, this is really a dream to come true for us.
[25:17.89]The world of Rage 2 is perfect for our style of gameplay.
[25:22.58]But even more exciting than that has been to work with these guys at id Software.
[25:27.06]These guys invented the first-person shooter.
[25:37.55]And they still make the best shooters out there.
[25:41.37]I actually heard Rage was fairly fun.
[25:42.67]Like, no joking around.
[25:44.44]So it's been a really great collaboration to bring you the most insane open world shooter you have ever played.
[25:51.67]Open world?
[25:53.23]So Rage 2 transports players into a dystopian future, devoid of society, law, and order.
[26:00.85]Now, you play as Walker, the last ranger of the wasteland.
[26:05.07]Walker, Texas ranger.
[26:05.77]Walker ranger.
[26:06.57]I can talk all night about our guns, the powers you'll use, the vehicle combat, and of course, the crazy open world.
[26:16.94]But I know that you are here to see the game.
[26:22.79]Well, not only do we have Rage 2 playable at our booth at E3, but we've got for you an extended look at the world and gameplay of Rage 2.
[26:36.85]Let's check it out right now.
[26:39.43]Asteroid on a collision course with Earth.
[26:50.23]Global extinction event.
[26:53.72]80% of the Earth's population dead.
[26:57.37]God turned his back on humanity long ago.
[27:02.47]It wasn't a war.
[27:04.67]It wasn't global warming.
[27:06.89]It was a fucking asteroid.
[27:10.80]I was born in this shithole.
[27:13.60]Parents murdered.
[27:14.94]An orphan of this wasteland.
[27:17.62]An army of mutants killed everyone I ever loved.
[27:24.04]All that's left is hate, fear, and the need for survival.
[27:32.89]No bleeps.
[27:33.29]See, part of growing up was watching everything get taken from me.
[27:36.73]I stood by, did nothing.
[27:39.65]And now, I'm the last ranger of this wasteland, and there's only one thing left to do!
[27:45.05]Um...
[27:54.32]Looks really good.
[27:56.66]Hello E3, and welcome to the world of Rage 2.
[28:00.86]In a moment, we'll dive headfirst into the Eden Spaceport mission, where Walker, our main protagonist, is out to find a rare artifact that will aid him in his quest to take down the Authority.
[28:13.62]If you see it, you can get there.
[28:19.28]Oh, come on, you didn't do a Breath of the Wild on us, like a GTA on us?
[28:24.07]Doctor, I'm approaching the Eden Space Center.
[28:26.87]Ah, yes.
[28:27.45]I forgot to say.
[28:29.09]It might be overrun by bandits.
[28:31.76]The Goon Squad, to be precise.
[28:34.04]You must likely slay them first before pulling down the Ecopod from orbit and securing the untainted nanotrites therein.
[28:43.04]I really don't like... I don't like car combat.
[28:46.04]I really don't.
[28:48.81]No one has really revolutionized the car combat game.
[28:54.10]It's kind of just this.
[28:54.89]Shoot the back of the car until it explodes.
[28:57.99]Ram the car and it'll explode.
[29:00.73]There needs to be some more innovative car combat.
[29:03.09]Doctor, we made it to the Space Center.
[29:12.42]Keep your wits about you, Walker.
[29:14.46]The goon squad may look whimsical, laughable even, but believe me, behind their playful appearance, they are very, very dangerous.
[29:30.42]Ah, that was cool.
[29:31.36]That was cool.
[29:31.96]I hope you can do that in the game.
[29:32.98]This isn't just a pretend scenario.
[29:34.96]The thing is, you can never trust E3 footage anymore.
[29:49.67]You can never sense it.
[29:52.15]Blastered on the bottom.
[29:53.43]This is real, I promise.
[30:01.98]Collector's edition, there it is.
[30:04.94]It mounts on the wall.
[30:06.48]It's motion sensor activated.
[30:08.64]Is the rocket the crusher talking?
[30:11.14]It can be yours wild and flat.
[30:12.83]Rage 2.
[30:33.87]The collectible ad is in the trailer, yeah.
[30:36.79]It's definitely going on your wall.
[30:40.15]Did Rage have a multiplayer?
[30:52.05]Yeah, it really is.
[30:52.97]But Bulletstorm was Rage, and Rage was Bulletstorm.
[30:56.10]They were kind of the same thing.
[30:58.50]In my brain.
[30:59.54]I know that's not the case, but my mind makes them the same thing.
[31:03.18]Unauthorized personnel are no longer present.
[31:09.69]Threat has been nullified.
[31:11.65]Mr. President, welcome to the...
[31:19.35]My mic's not loud enough, it's because I have the game turned up really loudly.
[31:22.15]Because we're watching the stuff.
[31:25.03]Recall sequence approved.
[31:29.34]Beginning Ecopod recall.
[31:38.03]So far, I'm not really seeing anything that's so different from the last one, besides the fact that they put an open world here.
[31:46.79]Really good looking game, but I don't... It's kind of just another one of these.
[31:51.01]Elevator still running?
[31:53.05]So far, so good.
[32:05.27]Looks like Ranger Walker is going to get a bit of a boost today.
[32:07.75]New abilities, leveling up and driving around and shooting things.
[32:15.50]Looks like the Dase Authority is going to be a problem.
[32:24.02]Holy shit!
[32:27.31]Oh, hell yeah!
[32:27.83]He wants to kill us and it looks better.
[32:43.12]Football helmet on?
[32:47.62]What's one of the zombies from Plants vs. Zombies?
[32:51.92]I understand it was expensive to license this music, but you don't have to.
[33:22.84]Well, that's coming up.
[33:24.60]Not soon.
[33:28.54]Bring them up.
[33:32.20]From Bethesda Softworks, Christian Van Hoose.
[33:35.66]That's not... Oh, it looks like we're gonna get to see their... How's it going, everybody?
[33:40.41]I'm Christian Van Hoose, community manager for The Elder Scrolls Legends.
[33:45.29]For the past year, we have taken what I think is the best digital card game and made it even better.
[33:52.40]New cards, new modes, new ways to play, and much more.
[33:56.92]But we wanted to push ourselves even further.
[33:59.16]So tonight, I'm thrilled to announce that we will soon be relaunching The Elder Scrolls Legends with brand new, totally overhauled visuals.
[34:08.11]I'm also very excited to let you all know that Legends will be available later this year on Nintendo Switch, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.
[34:21.24]Did you not say PC in that?
[34:23.74]But there's no reason to wait to play the game that Apple awarded best of the year in 2017.
[34:29.97]Download The Elder Scrolls Legends for free and join me tonight on PC, mobile, or tablet.
[34:36.43]And any progress you make in the game will be carried over to the console versions through your Bethesda Net account.
[34:42.21]You think I'm fucking around?
[34:44.82]You guys think this is a joke?
[34:47.44]He told me to do it.
[34:48.22]I'm going to do it.
[34:48.96]I'm going to give them the metrics they're looking for.
[34:51.62]And see why this isn't just my favorite card game, but will soon be yours as well.
[34:59.53]It starts small.
[35:00.97]One game is all it takes.
[35:03.05]But Legends never stay simple.
[35:05.55]Never stay small.
[35:07.63]This is action.
[35:09.23]This is story.
[35:10.43]This is competition.
[35:12.31]This is easy to pick up.
[35:14.03]This is hard to put down.
[35:18.43]This is a five-minute train ride.
[35:21.13]This is a five-hour marathon.
[35:23.37]Five-minute train ride?
[35:24.61]This is for any way you play.
[35:26.28]This is for anywhere you play.
[35:28.04]You can't play Hearthstone in five minutes.
[35:29.00]This is for strategy fans.
[35:29.64]It's like the guy conceived because you're playing Wallet Warrior.
[35:31.94]This is for those who want magic at their fingertips.
[35:34.52]Or a regeneration drill.
[35:35.42]This is for those who want dragons at their command.
[35:39.76]This is a game where legends are born.
[35:43.01]This is for you.
[35:45.43]How big is this game?
[35:55.95]I'm trying to download this.
[35:56.71]It's huge.
[35:56.97]From Zenimax Online Studios, Matt Fyror.
[36:02.97]Here we go.
[36:04.15]Thank you.
[36:04.59]Tell us about the movie you're making.
[36:07.76]Thanks, everyone.
[36:08.44]I'm Matt Fyror.
[36:09.54]I'm the game director on The Elder Scrolls Online.
[36:12.04]Oh, no.
[36:14.50]Thank you.
[36:16.59]Before I get started tonight, I just want to do a shout out.
[36:19.23]It was really great.
[36:20.15]We started the showcase tonight with the video highlighting the really talented people that work behind the scenes to make all of these great games possible.
[36:34.49]So standing here on stage, I'm representing a whole lot of amazing people at ZeniMax Online Studios that I go to work with every day.
[36:40.80]It's a great honor and privilege.
[36:43.21]So I go to work with them every day.
[36:45.66]But at night, I go home, log into Elder Scrolls Online, and I get to play games with you guys, the best gaming community in online gaming.
[36:58.01]Do people actually play these girls online?
[36:59.63]We are such big fans of what we do.
[37:01.45]We play the games just as we make them, and we play them just as much as you guys do.
[37:05.86]It's what we do.
[37:07.98]So you might not know it, but we're right there alongside.
[37:11.02]I'm playing there with you.
[37:12.18]I'm running dungeons.
[37:13.24]I'm exploring Tamriel, questing, crafting, decorating my house, PVPing, stabbing.
[37:20.22]Yeah, that was me.
[37:23.75]And I'm really humbled to say that The Elder Scrolls Online community just keeps getting bigger.
[37:28.58]We're over 11 million players now.
[37:30.64]11 million!
[37:32.48]There are 11 million players.
[37:36.14]And over a million of those came in just the last year alone.
[37:43.57]So last year was really great for us in a whole lot of ways.
[37:46.45]We were named MMO of the Year.
[37:47.79]This game's a long download.
[37:50.53]for the third straight year.
[37:51.71]But from who?
[37:52.99]From who?
[37:53.47]Like, your best friend that you go to lunch with.
[37:55.70]We released Morrowind.
[37:56.64]I could say that about anything.
[37:57.30]I could say that I have the best, I was rated the best screen in the world.
[37:59.42]A lot of great DLC and just last week we released Somerset, the latest chapter in The Elder Scrolls Online series.
[38:08.92]It's been received with great critical acclaim.
[38:12.32]Everyone loves it.
[38:13.14]You get to travel to the island home of the High Elves for the first time in 20 years.
[38:17.53]It's great for new players.
[38:18.71]If in the off chance you aren't playing Elder Scrolls Online, this is a great chance to jump in and play.
[38:23.31]And of course, all you veteran ESO fans are already there.
[38:26.05]We're already there.
[38:26.79]But we're not done there.
[38:28.49]We make DLC every quarter and chapters.
[38:33.25]Content comes out so regularly for Elder Scrolls Online.
[38:35.95]We're already working on our great plans for next year.
[38:38.77]But before that, the next DLC coming out is a dungeon DLC named Wolf Hunter based on werewolves.
[38:45.40]That guy just said, let's fucking go.
[38:50.62]And later this year, we have a story DLC named Merkmire.
[38:54.64]We're going back to Black Marsh.
[38:56.92]So you guys have all been asking for a deeper dive into Argonian lore and culture.
[39:01.54]What?
[39:01.70]You're gonna see it later this year.
[39:09.22]So there's one theme that runs through all of The Elder Scrolls Online's content, and that is great storytelling.
[39:14.38]From the launch game through all the DLC and chapters, it's really, really what holds the game together.
[39:20.07]But it's not just the stories that we as developers create for you guys to experience.
[39:24.57]It's also the stories that you create together when you play this great virtual world.
[39:29.50]So I'm going to leave you tonight with a video highlighting just some of the amazing stories and memorable characters that you'll meet on your ESO journey.
[39:37.76]See you later.
[39:38.32]Thanks, everyone.
[39:39.40]See you in 10 years.
[39:40.50]Did he say see you in 10 years?
[39:43.70]See you in 10 years.
[39:44.86]Why did he say that?
[39:56.06]See you later.
[39:59.82]Our next DLC comes out when everybody watching is in their late 30s.
[40:36.67]We're close so far, I guess.
[40:42.45]If it's time to party, we will party hard.
[42:00.65]I'm sorry, I fucking had to.
[42:32.25]Alright, I'm done.
[42:33.33]I'm done.
[42:40.63]I'm not going to do it anymore.
[42:42.86]I'm not going to do it.
[42:43.90]I'm done.
[42:44.34]I swear to God.
[42:53.12]Doom for the Doom.
[42:53.98]Doom for the Switch.
[43:00.71]Dude, it's gonna get to a point where Bethesda's gonna launch like 700 games a year.
[43:08.45]Because they put every game they've ever made on the new consoles.
[43:13.34]So eventually, like a hundred years in the future, they're gonna be porting from like 40 generations ago.
[43:20.58]Games on like the Nintendo Switcheroonie for like 2040.
[43:29.89]This is a new game, never mind.
[43:31.13]I'm gonna eat my words here.
[43:33.38]Thank you.
[43:34.56]Thanks so much.
[43:35.24]I'm Marty Stratton, executive producer of DOOM Eternal.
[43:40.58]And I'm Hugo Martin, creative director on DOOM Eternal.
[43:48.19]Oh, yeah.
[43:51.41]In 2016, we launched our reboot of Doom and have been blown away by your support and excitement for the game.
[43:59.89]Thank you.
[44:01.13]In fact, it's a combination of your passion and our team's love of making Doom that has motivated us to deliver even more.
[44:10.14]So we're back to announce DOOM Eternal.
[44:19.00]An awesome, awesome new sequel to Doom.
[44:22.83]For the past two years, it's been so inspiring to hear you guys talk about what you'd like to see next.
[44:29.37]And I got to tell you, we're right there with you.
[44:32.33]Like, you want the Doom Slayer to feel even more powerful?
[44:38.77]Well, we got it.
[44:39.71]Doom was fun.
[44:40.17]Doom was actually fun.
[44:41.43]You want even more badass demons.
[44:43.53]I know I streamed it like once.
[44:45.15]Well, there are twice as many in this game.
[44:48.69]Twice as many demons.
[44:50.38]You want to see hell on Earth?
[44:53.38]Well, we just teased it.
[44:57.80]But what we're most excited about is to show you some of the things that you might not be expecting.
[45:03.20]That's right, including a ton of features that we'll have to save for later because our team will be debuting DOOM Eternal at QuakeCon this August.
[45:10.95]That's a good ringtone.
[45:11.85]Just that beginning.
[45:16.11]We'd love for you to join us live in Dallas, or, of course, you can tune in online to catch all the fun.
[45:22.87]But until then, we want to thank everyone who continues to play Doom.
[45:27.05]Everybody calls me Ken the Kidder anyways.
[45:28.85]Thank you.
[45:29.17]You know, I'm just kidding around.
[45:32.08]You know, they call me Ken the Kidder.
[45:36.89]Yes, me and my girlfriend have separate cups with our names on them because I don't know what she's putting in her cup.
[45:44.06]I don't know what, I want to make sure we keep them separated.
[45:45.54]How's everybody feeling tonight?
[45:46.24]Pretty hype?
[45:49.10]Just like a little hype or like crazy hype right now, right?
[45:53.00]Let's go.
[45:55.33]Thanks.
[45:55.89]Hi, I'm Joshua Boyle, community manager for Quake Champions.
[46:02.03]Thank you very much.
[46:03.78]Ever since the first Quake title was released in 1996, our games have been shaped by you, the players.
[46:11.32]That proud tradition continues with Quake Champions, which has evolved with community in mind and will always be the fastest and most fun multiplayer shooter, period.
[46:27.11]And that's not the only tradition that Quake's continuing.
[46:31.21]These days, we're hearing a lot of talk about esports, but Quake has been there from the very beginning.
[46:37.03]Wasn't there?
[46:37.39]No, that was unreal.
[46:37.89]In fact, we started hosting competitions at QuakeCon over 20 years ago.
[46:45.06]Is it actually going to be a Quake?
[46:47.02]And this year, we'll expand on our legacy as the original esport with everything from intense grassroots competitions to major tournaments at QuakeCon and DreamHack Winter
[47:04.51]I mean, it's your video game in 2018.
[47:06.31]We've been doing this for a long time.
[47:08.27]And we're continuing to build with more competitions for more players than ever before.
[47:19.78]But I got to tell you guys, we can't stop, won't stop until we've delivered a game that's fun for everyone.
[47:25.92]Whether you're a Quake dad or a brand new baby to the arena.
[47:29.51]Quake dad.
[47:31.89]That's why we just added a bunch of new features to make it even easier for you and your friends to jump in and get good together.
[47:46.47]We're still in early access, but tonight we want to welcome all of you into the arena.
[47:51.23]Wasn't Quake Champions from 2011?
[47:54.39]Like 2008?
[47:55.37]For this week only, we're opening up Quake Champions to everyone through a trial of our free-to-play version before it even launches.
[48:04.87]Can I play the game?
[48:05.43]Let me see if I can play Elder Scrolls Legend.
[48:08.41]Yep, I'm ready.
[48:09.11]Plus, if you get in and download this week, you can stay and keep playing Quake Champions for free even after the trial closes.
[48:20.07]Nice.
[48:22.79]So head to Quake.com and start playing with me and all of my Quake family tonight.
[48:34.49]Don't miss your chance to join one of the most passionate and welcoming communities in gaming.
[48:39.80]Now.
[48:41.07]For a taste of what you'll be playing tonight, after our showcase is over, check out our new trailer for Quake Champions.
[48:48.42]I got an intro here that I have to watch.
[48:49.92]I think this is the tutorial, I think.
[48:52.60]Three, two, one.
[49:03.57]Here it tastes.
[49:04.49]You'll find out how tasty it is.
[49:21.17]I actually am going to play it though.
[49:27.15]I want to try it.
[49:37.47]Yes, I've read the terms.
[49:39.49]I should be watching this.
[49:40.41]I need to watch this.
[49:43.94]I can't worry about this.
[49:53.09]You know, I will probably give this game a try.
[49:55.81]I probably will play it.
[49:57.03]Just to try it.
[49:57.53]I mean, you have to, right?
[49:59.17]Is it going to be free?
[50:16.43]I wonder if it's actually going to be... Was I even paying attention to that?
[50:23.70]Grimma, you're going to suck, but we'll still love you.
[50:26.76]Don't be so sure.
[50:27.60]Did you see my 14 and 6 kill confirmed Modern Warfare 3 video I made six years ago?
[50:39.35]Hello E3 from all of us at Arcane Studios here in Austin, Texas.
[50:44.55]I'll get out of here.
[50:45.35]It's been one year since we launched Prey, and we want to send a big thanks to our incredible fan base for your support.
[50:51.82]We've been so inspired by your passion and enthusiasm, and as a way of showing our appreciation, we're rolling out a huge free update for Prey tonight.
[51:00.99]The next time you fire up Prey, you're gonna see three new modes.
[51:04.30]Story Mode, New Game Plus... Which was a big fan request.
[51:07.84]...and Survival Mode, which should be an interesting challenge for our most hardcore fans.
[51:12.07]But that's just the beginning.
[51:13.25]We are really excited to tell everyone that we've also been working on a new Prey DLC, an infinitely replayable experience called Mooncrash.
[51:21.05]It's a new twist on Prey where the enemies, hazards, and loot are all different each time you play.
[51:26.75]I always want to check it out, but then I just don't.
[51:28.21]We can't wait to see.
[51:29.23]What?
[51:32.29]Did they just die?
[51:34.27]What just happened?
[51:38.32]The moon is a harsh mistress.
[51:42.30]The longer you're here, the harder things are going to get for you.
[51:47.78]Let's get to work.
[51:55.92]I'm not playing this.
[51:59.14]I'm not playing that song.
[52:00.21]Let's get to work.
[52:03.47]I'm not playing this song.
[52:06.13]I told you.
[52:07.61]They just put, like, music in all their shit.
[52:20.29]I'm not doing this Detected
[52:41.41]Every death matters.
[52:47.49]So do they put Prop Hunt in Prey?
[53:02.75]You can hide as a bottle of Windex?
[53:10.91]Let's get to work.
[53:14.85]I mean, I... I don't get it.
[53:20.43]I don't... I don't get it.
[53:21.29]I don't understand it.
[53:31.18]Alright, before we begin, yes, Mom, I'm still alive.
[53:34.36]No, I'm not a mimic.
[53:37.51]Hang on.
[53:41.64]There.
[53:43.98]I just want to make sure nobody tries to smack you because I saw Pete Hines with a wrench backstage a second ago.
[53:51.09]Thank you, Ricardo.
[53:51.85]That's very sweet of you.
[53:53.81]So... Like all arcade games, Prey is about playing your own way, and Moon Crash is no exception.
[54:01.88]So you just saw a lot of cool stuff that's available tonight.
[54:06.10]But we're not done yet.
[54:07.89]We have one more surprise coming later this summer called Typhon Hunter.
[54:13.25]Typhon Hunter is a lethal game of hide and seek, where one player goes head to head against five other players who get to be mimics.
[54:21.93]And just like in Prey, the mimic players can disguise themselves as everyday objects.
[54:28.28]So, you know, things like a chair, a coffee mug, a space banana, whatever works.
[54:36.35]But definitely not a co-worker.
[54:39.71]Right, Susan?
[54:40.71]Absolutely not.
[54:44.90]Probably not.
[54:49.17]No!
[54:50.71]Anyway, Typhon Hunter is a tense multiplayer mode that requires teamwork and improvisation and a very high tolerance for jump scares.
[55:00.09]Before we go, I just want to say thanks on behalf of the whole team at Arkane Studios to all of our fans around the world who have played Prey and love it.
[55:10.62]We made this game for you, and we are constantly inspired by your creativity and enthusiasm.
[55:16.16]Thank you so much, everyone.
[55:25.26]I'm having too much fun.
[55:27.20]I got to go away.
[55:29.11]Please welcome Jens Mathis and Jerk Gustafsson.
[55:33.60]Hello, friends.
[55:43.08]I'm Jens Mathis, the creative director at MachineGames.
[55:48.53]And I'm Jerk Gustafsson, executive producer at MachineGames.
[55:52.85]Yeah, MachineGames!
[55:55.23]Last year, millions of you took to the streets and sparked a revolution in Wolfenstein II, The New Colossus.
[56:05.30]As BJ Blazkowicz, you rallied the American resistance and you beat the living fuck out of those Nazis.
[56:13.95]Yeah!
[56:16.81]That would have been a really bad place for this next show.
[56:19.45]Thank God I didn't press the fucking button.
[56:21.94]Not even kidding.
[56:23.68]That would have been very bad.
[56:25.04]I could have gotten a little bit of trouble on that one.
[56:29.68]Can't use this one here.
[56:41.03]And the Wolfenstein revolution continues with our next project which leaps ahead in time to tell the tale of BJ's twin daughters.
[56:55.14]Set in the 1980s in Paris, Wolfenstein Youngblood pushes the story forward.
[57:10.31]And because this game features BJ's twin daughters, Wolfenstein Youngblood will be a co-op experience.
[57:18.18]I gotta get off the camera for this.
[57:22.78]So while you can play it solo, you can also join with a friend to save the world together.
[57:28.30]The resistance is counting on you.
[57:35.26]Alright, Hollywood, let's check it out.
[57:37.80]Let's watch it.
[57:38.54]Let's see that.
[57:39.00]It is actually by Wolf and Shadeen.
[57:41.59]It's a pretty good game.
[57:42.31]Alright, goodbye.
[57:43.33]I'm out of here.
[57:49.44]Listen, children.
[57:50.90]Imagine if I played the boo after those first two statements.
[57:53.22]I've been fighting all my life for this world.
[58:04.36]They're gonna send everything they have at you.
[58:09.72]To survive, you have to embrace the suffering.
[58:16.58]To stand up and carry it.
[58:21.16]It's not about the pain you can deal.
[58:25.45]It's about how much you can take.
[58:29.77]It's your diocese.
[58:31.55]Just like Papa taught us.
[58:34.89]Wolfenstein.
[58:35.81]Young Bloods.
[58:39.26]Coming 2019 at the end of the year.
[58:41.64]Probably in the winter.
[58:43.94]If I were to take a guess.
[58:53.55]Like, this guy's back on stage.
[58:55.74]This guy comes back on stage and they fucking poop.
[59:11.04]Two of the franchises that we just heard about are going to also offer VR experiences.
[59:15.78]So, when Prey's Typhon Hunter is released later this summer, you'll be able to experience the competitive mode that Susan and Ricardo were just talking about in virtual reality.
[59:27.55]And it will also include a single-player experience between the boots of Transtar employees working to solve puzzles aboard the Talos 1 space station.
[59:37.55]I'm also excited to announce a new Wolfenstein VR game.
[59:44.66]It's called Wolfenstein Cyberpilot, in which you play a hacker who can take over Nazi robots and turn these war machines against their masters.
[59:53.28]That's not just, you know, jump scare the video game or look at your shoes, you know what I mean?
[59:56.99]They're doing... What did you say?
[59:57.69]Oh, I was at the airport.
[60:06.40]No, you can get behind that.
[60:07.60]I can get behind that.
[60:10.26]Both the Prey and Wolfenstein VR experiences are playable this week at our booth at E3, so please stop by and give them a try.
[60:18.62]Now, we are really excited about everything that we've shown here tonight, but I know there are a lot of you who are really here or really wondering about Fallout 76.
[60:32.79]Yeah.
[60:34.35]Is it a Fallout game?
[60:35.01]I'm pleased to tell you that your wait is finally over.
[60:39.91]Ladies and gentlemen, he is the recipient of numerous Lifetime Achievement and Hall of Fame awards.
[60:46.05]He's the game director at a studio that has won a bevy of accolades and awards.
[60:52.91]And he's here tonight to tell us what he and his team have been taking so damn long to tell us all about.
[61:00.61]Will you please welcome my very good friend, Mr. Todd Howard.
[61:04.77]Bring him up.
[61:06.79]Watch him closely.
[61:10.88]And wave if that's okay.
[61:25.41]We're all here.
[61:29.63]Looking good.
[61:30.79]One clap.
[61:31.09]Come on.
[61:31.99]Oh, it's great to be back at E3.
[61:33.67]Thank you.
[61:34.11]Thank you so much.
[61:35.87]I could not be more excited to be here.
[61:37.83]I want to thank all our fans who came out tonight.
[61:45.36]And the millions of you watching online.
[61:47.74]We can't thank you enough.
[61:49.52]This is actually my 25th year at Bethesda.
[61:55.12]And I have seen... Oh, yeah.
[62:00.13]I have seen a lot of cool things in that time.
[62:02.67]I got to say, tonight is definitely, definitely one of them.
[62:06.47]I got to go to the very first E3 right here in Los Angeles.
[62:12.62]I know.
[62:13.08]They're so cute when they're little.
[62:16.48]They're full of energy and life.
[62:18.42]I didn't get it.
[62:18.80]I didn't have it ready.
[62:19.58]And then, remember when little E3 ran away from home, went to Atlanta?
[62:23.83]Yes.
[62:24.15]A lot of you didn't come.
[62:24.89]I don't have time.
[62:25.45]I liked Atlanta or East Coast.
[62:29.27]And then E3 went through the moody teen years and came back and locked itself in its room.
[62:34.97]He's got the look here.
[62:36.43]It was in the convention center, but just in the meeting rooms.
[62:40.16]They didn't invite anybody.
[62:42.10]And I can remember literally walking between the halls and seeing nobody.
[62:48.17]I was like, this is how a zombie movie starts.
[62:54.07]And now E3 has grown up, it's in its 20s, it's more confident, can handle alcohol better, like all of you.
[63:01.95]Thank you.
[63:02.55]I should have said he was going to do a weird story.
[63:07.57]There's a good party after this, so pace yourselves.
[63:11.55]There is?
[63:11.90]Oh, can I go?
[63:12.24]I hope you're comfortable, by the way.
[63:13.42]You're going to be here for a while.
[63:14.54]Do I get to go?
[63:16.94]And E3 has become such an incredible week of entertainment, but we know that most of you came here for one thing.
[63:26.78]Fallout.
[63:27.00]Todd Howard!
[63:28.56]Thank you.
[63:32.80]Find who said that.
[63:34.66]Zoom in on his face.
[63:38.50]What if he was like, who fucking said that?
[63:39.84]Who the fuck said that?
[63:40.90]I think it's to see where we're putting Skyrim next.
[63:43.23]Get him on stage.
[63:48.94]Well, I think we have the best one yet.
[63:53.72]The Elder Scrolls speak of the past and the future.
[63:58.24]Now, Skyrim looks to the future, to its ultimate version.
[64:05.09]This is a joke.
[64:05.61]They're doing a joke.
[64:13.33]Alexa, play Skyrim.
[64:15.88]You're level 57 and see a tall snowy mountain.
[64:19.88]Climb it.
[64:20.54]Now Skyrim and life become one.
[64:24.24]A mud crab scuttles towards you.
[64:25.70]Fus Ro Dah!
[64:26.33]I didn't catch that.
[64:27.11]Fus Ro Dah!
[64:28.83]I didn't quite catch that.
[64:29.95]Fus Ro Dah!
[64:31.89]Your shout echoes all the way to Sovngarde.
[64:34.57]What happened?
[64:37.47]Fus Ro Dah.
[64:38.55]That's the command for knocking things over.
[64:41.71]Is there a command for picking shit up?
[64:45.94]Ever reached that level yet?
[64:47.26]I'm sworn to carry your burdens.
[64:50.00]Ooh.
[64:51.44]The dragon unleashes fire breath on you.
[64:53.40]He got up with the memes.
[64:54.56]You have 7% health left.
[64:56.68]Oh, shit.
[64:57.72]I drink a health potion.
[64:59.38]You are out of health potions.
[65:01.93]Oh, how many wheels of cheese do I have left?
[65:04.31]473.
[65:04.33]Okay, I eat all the cheese.
[65:06.05]I eat all of the cheese.
[65:07.45]Hey, hun.
[65:08.01]Um...
[65:12.85]Remember what the doctor said about dairy?
[65:15.59]Yes, right, yes, of course.
[65:18.09]You're the greatest.
[65:19.09]Thank you so much.
[65:21.79]I ate all of the cheese.
[65:23.67]Introducing Skyrim, very special edition.
[65:27.95]Also coming soon to Etch-A-Sketch, Motorola Pagers.
[65:32.43]Hey, this is my joke.
[65:34.09]And your Samsung smart refrigerator.
[65:36.84]They got the joke, my title joke.
[65:40.08]Shit, now I gotta delete that.
[65:40.98]Oh, that's cool.
[65:41.92]I gotta delete it.
[65:43.77]That can't be the title now.
[65:46.11]Shit, I gotta get that off.
[65:53.56]Had to do it, had to do it.
[65:55.10]Quick, I gotta, quick.
[65:58.10]Okay, really, we both know why you're here, and that's to talk about the next Fallout.
[66:08.32]Is that good enough?
[66:09.14]Fallout 76 is a prequel to all the other games, and it's our biggest one yet.
[66:16.06]It is four times the size of Fallout 4.
[66:22.95]Set in the hills of West Virginia, you are one of the first to emerge into an untamed and very different wasteland.
[66:31.09]We're not going to watch the same trailer for the third time, are we?
[66:47.47]But who made it?
[66:48.01]Did Obsidian make it?
[66:50.97]It's the same fucking trailer.
[67:01.72]I don't want to see the same one.
[67:03.84]It's not, is it?
[67:17.02]300 years after our great nation began, we gather together to honor the completion of Vault 76.
[67:24.69]This sprawling underground shelter may have been engineered by Vault-Tec, but it was built by you.
[67:33.30]So that if the bombs do come, our way of life will endure.
[67:43.43]I'm not going to sing it.
[67:52.57]I did the I sing along thing twice already.
[67:55.60]I'm not doing it for the third time.
[68:00.04]Younger than the mountains Blowing like the breeze Country roads Take me home To the place Where I belong Country of West Virginia Mountain high and high Take me home Country roads
[68:28.60]For when the fighting is stopped and the fallout is settled, you must rebuild.
[68:37.11]Not just walls, not just buildings, but hearts and minds, and ultimately, America itself.
[68:46.31]In Vault 76, our future begins.
[68:59.39]But that really was the same drill.
[69:07.99]Come on, Todd.
[69:08.56]What's going on here?
[69:10.84]Vault 76, one of the very first vaults to open, was built to celebrate America's tercentenary, which is an awesome word, by the way.
[69:22.15]Like, that's your word of the night, tercentenary.
[69:25.97]You are one of the very special few selected to be an occupant.
[69:30.08]Least happy special few.
[69:31.34]And spent 25 years underground waiting for Reclamation Day, the day the Vault opens.
[69:44.19]Good morning, Vault 76.
[69:46.07]This is the Overseer.
[69:49.62]It's a Jerma tier joke.
[69:50.78]What the fuck?
[69:51.44]Golden Pip-Boy?
[69:51.84]Oh, come on.
[69:52.24]I really thought that was gonna be like a rare Golden Pip-Boy.
[69:55.54]Today is Reclamation Day.
[70:20.30]Oh, finally.
[70:22.26]I feared you'd never wake up.
[70:24.82]Don't you remember?
[70:25.78]Time to leave the vault.
[70:28.06]Most of the others have already gone.
[70:31.03]It may be time for me, but I'll never forget the day you all entered Vault 76.
[70:37.65]You come from every walk of life, every race, color, and creed.
[70:43.09]But you all share one very important trait.
[70:47.17]You are this country's best and brightest.
[70:51.40]But more importantly, you'll always be my family.
[70:54.82]Cogsworth is from Beauty and the Beast.
[70:58.14]That's the guy with the clockwork face.
[71:09.11]Country road, West Virginia.
[71:11.60]They're going to do it again.
[71:14.20]Take me home.
[71:19.66]Really milk the song.
[71:20.42]We always start with the world, and this time it features all new rendering, lighting, and landscape technology.
[71:27.23]He starts singing it.
[71:28.17]It allows us to have 16 times the detail and even view distant weather systems across the map.
[71:38.05]That is a gigantic widescreen.
[71:39.71]What's the resolution on that?
[71:40.69]Most people don't know West Virginia that well.
[71:43.70]It is an incredible array of natural wonders, towns, and government secrets.
[71:50.18]This is where the actual nuclear secrets are.
[71:53.90]And the quest the Overseer sends you on will take you through six distinct regions, each with their own style, risks, and rewards.
[72:06.14]There's plenty of cool new Fallout creatures, and we even use the folklore of West Virginia to bring our Fallout versions to life.
[72:16.52]It sounds funny.
[72:31.51]Monsters look really cool.
[72:32.44]I got that going.
[72:35.02]I got good monster design.
[72:37.42]We have always wanted to tell that story of what it will be like for you and the other characters who were first to leave the vaults.
[72:48.51]But there is one big difference with this game.
[72:52.75]It's that each of those characters is a real person.
[73:02.61]What do you mean by that?
[73:03.95]Because, yes, Fallout 76 is entirely online.
[73:14.34]Okay.
[73:15.30]I thought he meant like they recreated every resident in West Virginia.
[73:20.40]So I'm going to go through them in order.
[73:23.08]That's kind of a personal privacy issue.
[73:26.00]First, of course, you can play this solo.
[73:29.46]Alright?
[73:30.64]You'll...
[73:32.21]You'll be who you want, exploring a huge world, doing quests, experiencing a story, and leveling up.
[73:39.86]We love those things about our games, too.
[73:42.54]It would not have it any other way.
[73:45.64]But also, like many of you, we have always wanted to see what our style of game could be with multiplayer.
[73:54.48]So many of us talk about experiences in our games, but we've never experienced them together.
[74:03.27]So about four years ago, we hit upon an idea that is perfect for Fallout.
[74:11.98]Open world, survival.
[74:14.18]No.
[74:14.86]Every person and character is real.
[74:19.16]And it was an idea that we just couldn't shake.
[74:23.81]We knew we had to do it and do it in a really big way.
[74:28.59]Now, I know you may have played survival modes in some of our previous games or some other online games.
[74:35.14]And people wonder, is this hardcore survival?
[74:40.20]I like to think of it maybe it's more soft core survival.
[74:47.77]Maybe that should be a new ESRB descriptor.
[74:54.52]Death never means the loss of progression or the loss of your character.
[75:00.22]Your character isn't tied to one server.
[75:03.69]As a matter of fact, you'll never even see a server when you play.
[75:08.71]You'll be in a world with dozens, not hundreds, and not thousands of other players.
[75:15.67]It's the apocalypse.
[75:16.67]It's not an amusement park, okay?
[75:19.67]And you'll be able to join your friends whenever you want, and all of your progression goes with you.
[75:29.64]That's a big deal, what he just said.
[75:31.00]That's actually a pretty big deal.
[75:32.26]When we think about games, we think about worlds and the choices that you can make, the stories that you create and tell yourself.
[75:44.45]By creating a wide open world with very few rules, we have a game more than any game that we've ever done where the choices are yours, where you'll decide what happens.
[75:57.23]You'll decide the heroes, and you'll decide the villains.
[76:01.01]Look, this is a whole new world for all of us here.
[76:04.40]And fortunately, our friends at Vault-Tec have made a series of informational videos for when all of us emerge together.
[76:15.14]So it's like Fallout Rust.
[76:17.60]I wonder how the hell this would even work.
[76:25.79]You can do it solo.
[76:26.53]As you venture out into this new American frontier, some of your fellow survivors may not be neighborly.
[76:40.92]So action points can't exist then, or can they?
[76:44.34]During an all online kind of mode?
[76:48.12]You can't use the VAT system on somebody.
[76:49.72]What, are you gonna turn off their game?
[76:58.71]Chin up there, sport.
[77:00.45]Not all Vault 76 dwellers will be so hostile.
[77:04.03]Find them and brave the new world together.
[77:08.33]Whether you choose to explore the wasteland alone or with friends, your days will be filled with fun activities.
[77:16.67]You can run like a rabbit, fly like a bee.
[77:19.35]No matter what you do, you'll never get away from me because I'm right behind you, baby.
[77:23.87]Right behind you.
[77:29.20]Instruments?
[77:30.38]Alright, that's... I guess the bat system is gone in this mode.
[77:38.33]I'm sure we'll...
[77:56.88]Because if you remove the VAT system from the game, that actually might make this more interesting.
[78:11.73]Like previous fallouts, you can play this game solo in Quest.
[78:16.42]But the easiest way to survive in the wasteland is to team up and build together.
[78:22.18]And in this one, you can build wherever you want.
[78:26.47]And you can also then move that to wherever you want.
[78:30.93]So is the solo mode just kind of a...
[78:34.19]Is it just kind of the same thing?
[78:35.85]I don't know.
[78:36.55]I'm confused.
[78:37.21]So there's not separate modes.
[78:39.35]The construction and assembly mobile platform.
[78:42.09]Construct your home of the future.
[79:00.67]With your home secure, you can now craft handmade ordnance at your leisure to give your altercations that personal touch.
[79:12.02]It falls on you and the ingenuity of your fellows to rebuild the America we hold dear.
[79:18.04]How would you play this offline?
[79:25.80]But don't become too attached too quickly.
[79:29.24]Monitor your environment for anything out of the ordinary.
[79:40.83]The home of tomorrow may undergo certain challenges.
[79:48.60]After a crisis, work with your neighbors to ensure success.
[79:52.06]So then it's a persistent online world.
[79:55.06]There's no I in nuclear wasteland.
[79:58.04]I can't wait to get stomped on by a team of four while I'm just trying to build a fucking fence.
[80:02.41]Document your adventures.
[80:04.07]Your memories will shape the new American dream.
[80:07.85]I can't wait to get briefed in this game.
[80:09.71]What's that sound?
[80:11.29]Oh, dear.
[80:14.59]There goes the neighborhood.
[80:23.97]You know, we love dynamic game systems.
[80:27.90]So we thought, why don't we put multiple nuclear missile sites on the map?
[80:37.87]You just blow up the map?
[80:38.63]And then let all of you do whatever you want with them.
[80:45.83]Wait, did he just nuke the fucking server?
[80:48.31]For peace.
[80:50.11]When you emerge from the comfort and safety of your vault, the world you know will have changed.
[80:56.34]Take your friendly old neighbor, Johnny.
[80:59.46]Rather than coming over to borrow a cup of sugar, he may now be coming over for murder.
[81:06.88]The time has come to seek out greater means of protection.
[81:11.61]Nuclear armaments.
[81:14.07]That's right.
[81:15.21]Courtesy of your Uncle Sam, these wonders of the atomic age can be found right in your own backyard.
[81:22.42]But how does a fella like you acquire nuclear weapons, you may ask?
[81:28.60]Begin by inquiring with the locals.
[81:31.60]Gently coax them into cooperation.
[81:35.32]Use a little elbow grease if you have to.
[81:40.87]Alright, over-under if this game's gonna be free with microtransactions.
[81:45.16]What do you think the over-under is?
[81:47.62]In the likely event you don't acquire a full code on your own, do not give up.
[81:52.66]Here comes the free announcement.
[81:53.90]Search for others who might be harboring a grudge.
[81:57.86]You'll have that nuclear launch code in no time.
[82:03.05]With the power of the atom at your fingertips, be responsible and consider your target carefully.
[82:10.03]Attention.
[82:11.27]Launch sequence activated.
[82:13.81]You can already buy it now.
[82:22.13]So what happens to your shit?
[82:23.23]Will your bomb land on a rival camp of degenerates?
[82:27.06]A random stranger?
[82:28.70]The local wildlife?
[82:32.57]Whatever your target may be, take advantage of the resulting fallout to gather rare and valuable resources.
[82:46.94]Yet these rewards don't come without risk.
[82:53.82]The fate of this new world is yours to command with the power of the Atom.
[83:00.33]from all the central locations and build yourself up like a hill somewhere.
[83:08.32]We know you've played a lot of our games and a lot of online games, but this one really is unique.
[83:15.60]We have built a platform, 100% dedicated servers, that will support this game now and for years to come.
[83:29.35]Until we shut it off.
[83:30.57]And look, look, we know this is new for all of you.
[83:33.80]It's new for us.
[83:34.78]It's a little bit scary.
[83:36.70]And to that end, we're going to need your help.
[83:40.30]Because yes, we are going to have a beta.
[83:47.47]And it is sponsored by our friends at Vault-Tec as well.
[83:51.61]The Break It Early test application.
[83:55.51]Maybe like July or something.
[83:57.39]Because evidently, these online games are hard.
[84:00.59]They can have some nasty issues.
[84:03.42]I read on the internet that our games have had a few bugs.
[84:09.38]I did.
[84:09.70]I read it on the internet, so it's true.
[84:12.64]So they do it in early access?
[84:13.70]Sometimes.
[84:14.36]They are, aren't they?
[84:15.38]It doesn't just work.
[84:17.08]Oh, man.
[84:21.10]Anyway, we know together that we are going to build something really special.
[84:26.48]And we also know that all of you love our special editions.
[84:31.80]And we have an awesome collector's edition for you.
[84:36.24]It starts with a map of the world that glows in the fucking dark.
[84:44.53]And beta.
[84:45.67]The beta's in here.
[84:49.64]So cool.
[84:52.56]It comes with figures you can put on the map.
[84:56.21]And it also comes with a Fallout collectible that, really, I've always wanted.
[85:00.45]So we made them for everybody to buy.
[85:02.93]And here it is.
[85:03.65]Straighten up and fly right.
[85:09.13]Straighten up and fly right.
[85:11.22]What?
[85:12.16]Straighten up and fly right.
[85:13.96]The power armor?
[85:14.82]Cool down, Papa.
[85:16.06]Don't you blow your top.
[85:19.35]That's right, real power armor.
[85:21.45]Head to toe, made of titanium.
[85:24.63]Putting a manufacturer's retail price at $19,800.
[85:30.17]Yes, all of this, the Fallout 76 power armor edition.
[85:47.32]So you're probably wondering, when is this game coming out?
[85:51.94]We're excited to say that it's coming out this year, November 14th.
[86:03.99]And when is the beta, Todd?
[86:06.65]When is it?
[86:07.63]Thanks again for all your support of Fallout.
[86:11.55]It's been 10 years since Fallout 3, our very first one.
[86:16.57]And it's been an incredible journey with all of you.
[86:18.71]We do have another Fallout anniversary that we are celebrating here at E3.
[86:24.50]It is the three-year anniversary of Fallout Shelter, which we announced and released right here at E3.
[86:34.56]And we have some cool surprises for you.
[86:37.76]Fallout Shelter is coming to the PlayStation 4.
[86:44.23]And because that guy said it, it's also coming to the Nintendo Switch.
[86:52.66]You can play it with the Joy-Cons or touch controls.
[86:56.40]And yes, it's still free.
[87:00.20]Barely.
[87:01.46]I played this game for like an hour.
[87:02.60]Just one of those build more things and wait for more things to happen and then click on more things and make more rooms.
[87:09.19]And excited to say these versions are coming out tonight.
[87:17.65]Again, thank you so much for your support of all that we do coming here tonight.
[87:24.14]When we see how many of you our games have touched, it's incredibly special, especially Fallout Shelter.
[87:31.96]That game has been played by over 120 million people.
[87:34.88]Incredible.
[87:41.98]That is more people than every game that we have made combined.
[87:51.63]Incredible.
[87:53.29]It does kind of make you stop and realize that our games can have new lives on any type of device or system.
[88:01.91]And you know, when we looked at the iPhone 11 years ago, we had a few ideas for mobile games.
[88:08.35]Fallout Shelter was one of them.
[88:10.37]And we did have another one that was far, far more ambitious.
[88:16.43]And we've been building it.
[88:19.35]And it's in the other franchise that you love from us.
[88:23.68]The Elder Scrolls Skyrim Mobile.
[88:26.58]It is called The Elder Scrolls Blades.
[88:33.41]Mobile Elder Scrolls.
[88:37.05]Like Fallout Shelter, we wanted an experience that we were not finding anywhere else.
[88:45.87]Here it is.
[88:46.83]That feeling when everyone in this chat is disappointed it's not Skyrim Mobile.
[88:49.97]Blades, at its heart, is a pure Elder Scrolls game.
[88:54.35]A massive first-person RPG with console-quality graphics.
[89:00.99]but with a uniquely mobile experience.
[89:04.73]Believe me when I say you have to see this running on an iPhone X. This gigantic screen does not do it justice.
[89:12.39]You can tap to move or use dual sticks.
[89:15.53]Can this even work on any other system?
[89:18.43]Combat is all new, and it follows your specific movements and timings.
[89:34.02]I'm going to play this one.
[89:34.70]Is it weird that this is the guy I want to play this game with?
[89:36.82]Why?
[89:36.94]I don't know.
[89:57.71]And of course, you can create your own character and be who you want to be.
[90:02.90]Improving them, leveling up, picking new abilities.
[90:11.38]And the entire game can be played in portrait mode.
[90:21.83]That one was incredibly important to us, that you could play it however you wanted.
[90:28.99]You never know when you'll need a free hand.
[90:30.73]You can play, yeah, you know.
[90:32.97]You never know when you're gonna have a free hand.
[90:34.39]To hold your coffee, what do you... Degenerates.
[90:42.52]Somebody said it.
[90:44.26]And it's not just dungeons.
[90:45.76]Somebody actually said it.
[90:46.66]It's incredible outdoor areas.
[90:49.60]Yes, running on a phone.
[90:51.48]It really looks and plays incredible.
[91:08.46]Actually, no, I'm not excited anymore.
[91:17.41]Blaze has several modes of play.
[91:20.95]First, the Abyss, a rogue-like experience where you can see how far you can go in an endless dungeon.
[91:29.58]And the Arena, where you will do battle one-on-one against other players.
[91:35.08]And the main mode, the Town,
[91:38.36]This is the hub for your story and quests.
[91:42.17]You are a member of the Blades, the Empire's top agents.
[91:47.79]Forced in exile, you return home to find your town destroyed and need to rebuild it.
[91:54.89]Yes, Blades also features a town building mode.
[91:59.26]You'll decide what your town looks like
[92:01.66]and be able to upgrade and decorate all of the individual elements in it.
[92:06.64]As your town levels up, you'll unlock new NPCs, quests, and more.
[92:11.59]You can even visit your friends' towns.
[92:19.97]What happened?
[92:27.07]Was that intentional?
[92:28.14]Or was he going to do a thing where he comes up like the Undertaker?
[92:31.63]This is an Elder Scrolls game that you can play however and wherever you want.
[92:36.78]And we are going to bring blades to every device and system we can.
[92:42.08]Phones, PCs, consoles, also virtual reality, on mobile, all the way up to high-end VR.
[92:53.39]On PCs.
[92:53.79]And what's really cool is all of those connect to each other.
[93:00.06]So one of my dreams is we'll go back to that portrait mode.
[93:03.50]We like to call it meeting mode.
[93:04.74]Because if you're in a meeting and you're playing a game, in portrait mode, no one knows you're playing a game.
[93:13.91]Until they call on you for input at the fucking company meeting where, by the way, we're bleeding like $20,000 a month, Jane.
[93:23.88]And what are you doing over there?
[93:25.04]What, are you playing a game?
[93:27.50]You're fired.
[93:35.11]And you can pre-order it tonight on both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store.
[93:41.55]Also, this week, go to playblades.com and register for early access.
[93:48.35]If you're here at E3, Blades is going to be playable in our booth.
[93:52.97]So please, come by and check it out.
[93:55.15]You really need to see it running on the phone.
[93:57.83]We'd love to see you.
[93:58.79]Please come by.
[93:59.37]That's alright.
[94:04.01]It'll be fun for a few hours.
[94:05.86]You'll play it.
[94:06.54]I'll play it.
[94:07.06]I just want to thank you all again, all of our fans here, everybody watching online, for all of your support over the years.
[94:14.71]It is so exciting to show you all that we have coming out this year, and it is an honor and a blessing
[94:21.47]to represent all of the incredible people at Bethesda Game Studios.
[94:25.92]But wait.
[94:26.46]We have three offices now in Maryland, Montreal, and Austin.
[94:31.24]There's a lot of them here tonight.
[94:32.96]I want them to hear your appreciation for their work.
[94:38.94]Are they going to come on and do a company bow?
[94:42.32]Are they going to do a big curtain call here?
[94:47.22]Oh, no.
[94:47.72]Okay, never mind.
[95:01.04]Just the best team and group of people I could ever hope for.
[95:05.41]Amazing.
[95:07.79]We also thought since we're all here together tonight and it's so special, maybe we'd do something a little different too.
[95:13.15]Bring it out.
[95:15.07]Come on.
[95:15.80]And tell you what we have coming beyond this year in the future.
[95:23.24]We have also been working on a brand new next generation single player game.
[95:32.78]You can't announce stuff at E3 that's not, like, the next year.
[95:35.70]But this one is in an all-new epic franchise.
[95:41.36]Our first wholly original franchise in 25 years.
[95:50.41]And it's Card Game.
[95:54.93]We're excited to announce our next adventure.
[96:05.28]The Ghostbusters video game.
[96:08.16]I'll get out of here for this.
[96:38.63]Star Trek.
[96:42.35]Star Trek game?
[96:43.18]No, it's original.
[96:53.87]Starfield.
[96:57.27]Starfield.
[96:59.51]Starfield in space.
[97:03.80]The orange lasagna loving cat.
[97:05.92]Starfield is a game that we have spent years thinking about and working on.
[97:13.10]Something we feel uniquely positioned to pull off and that we're incredibly excited about.
[97:20.45]But we're also building toward the game after that.
[97:27.09]And it's the one you keep asking about.
[97:43.59]Starfield 2!
[97:44.33]There it is, the Pirates of the Caribbean theme song!
[98:00.59]The Elder Scrolls VI.
[98:15.62]Okay, actually, now I'm really done.
[98:17.78]I just want to thank you all for your time tonight.
[98:20.46]The time you've spent in our worlds.
[98:22.39]We'll see you out there.
[98:29.91]There it is.
[98:30.39]I'm looking forward.
[98:33.12]Can I get another round of applause, please?
[98:36.24]I thought Todd just said that.
[98:37.89]Excuse me, can I get another round of applause, please?
[98:40.83]I thought he just said that on the mic.
[98:43.32]Like a hot mic, like fucking degenerates.
[98:45.48]Can I get another round of applause?
[98:47.06]God damn it.
[98:47.96]But boy, when he shows up, he brings the goods.
[98:51.43]Anything else?
[98:52.13]Thanks also to all of our studios and teams around the world who are so dedicated to giving our fans the very best games.
[98:58.46]If you're a gamer on any platform of any kind, we think we've got something for you.
[99:02.98]And I hope you're as excited about what you've seen tonight as we are, whether it's a new Fallout game, a new Elder Scrolls game from Bethesda Game Studios that you can play on your phone for free.
[99:15.08]Rage 2, DOOM Eternal, and so much more.
[99:18.29]We're really excited.
[99:19.29]Now, remember, if you want to be one of the first to play Elder Scrolls Blades or join the Fallout 76 beta, you need to go to BethesdaNet and register.
[99:27.93]It's easy and it's free.
[99:30.14]For all of you here with us tonight, thank you so much for joining.
[99:32.94]The party is going to continue afterwards.
[99:34.88]For everyone else around the world, thank you so much for joining us.
[99:38.30]Everyone have a good night and a great E3.
[99:50.57]Welcome back to E3 on Twitch.
[99:52.55]It's 2017.
[99:52.89]This is the end, almost, of our day one.
[99:59.16]Don't show just fucking pizza.
[100:00.98]I don't want them to see these fucking advertisements over here.
[100:08.46]That's not my ad.
[100:09.24]I don't get any money for that.
[100:17.03]Alright.
[100:19.83]That's it.
[100:26.95]But, anyways.
[100:27.89]Thanks for hanging around.
[100:28.91]Thanks for hanging around.
[100:29.65]If I could talk, that'd be great.
[100:33.23]There's a lot of people here right now.
[100:35.31]Thank you for joining us.
[100:38.55]Enjoy the rest of the E-Free Car.
[100:40.60]I swear to God.
[100:42.74]Something happened to my brain in the last 30 seconds.
[100:45.56]Uh, take care.
[100:46.40]Have you just taken off now?
[100:48.27]I'm not gonna be streaming tomorrow.
[100:50.25]I'm not gonna do the Sony conference.
[100:53.01]Devolver?
[100:54.53]No, no.
[100:54.97]I gotta get to work.
[100:57.09]Devolver isn't for like another... Isn't Devolver in like an hour?
[101:02.77]I think Devolver is like an hour from now.
[101:10.53]No, it's in like three minutes.
[101:11.59]No, I can't.
[101:12.05]I gotta go.
[101:14.67]I've been streaming for like seven hours.
[101:19.49]I have to get to work for Tuesday.
[101:21.05]I have to- You work?
[101:24.46]I have to work.
[101:25.06]I have to do- I've got something I gotta try to plan as soon as possible for Tuesday's Nintendo conference, alright?
[101:33.30]I have to see if I can get it done.
[101:36.22]Work- I got work to do, okay?
[101:42.63]And I can't just, I can't just stream all night.
[101:46.84]It's nothing to do with Nintendo Labo, though.
[101:48.24]Nope, nope, nope, nope.
[101:48.80]Something different.
[101:54.50]But let me, um... Turn this off.
[101:59.19]We're gonna really, really quickly here... Okay, let's do that.
[102:04.95]There we go.
[102:05.29]Now I can talk.
[102:07.60]So let's do the credits.
[102:09.92]These are gonna go over... What the fuck am I doing?
[102:13.62]Thanks to everybody that subbed and resubbed tonight.
[102:17.38]Here.
[102:18.30]Let's see how many there were.
[102:19.22]It looked like there were a lot.
[102:21.45]Oh my god, there's so many.
[102:22.51]Oh, I'm going to fuck this whole thing up.

[104:55.97]Was that a thousand people?
[105:00.16]I can't stop it, by the way.
[105:02.14]I can't stop it.
[105:06.80]I can't stop it.
[105:09.36]I can't slow it down.
[105:11.18]It's gauged on how many people subscribe.
[105:13.90]I gotta get like a different program.
[105:18.46]Oh my lord.
[105:20.14]What a disaster.
[105:21.99]What a fucking disaster.
[105:26.83]Slow it down so I can read it easier.
[105:28.53]If I slow it down... Devolver is live now.
[105:37.92]Alright, let's do Devolver until I go through the bits.
[105:40.74]How does that sound?
[105:42.99]That's what we're going to do.
[105:47.99]We'll have Devolver in the background while I do bits.
[105:52.63]Forget about the OBS project.
[105:59.13]Alright, what was it?
[106:09.26]v3 yeah okay there it is I'm gonna try to run through the bits as fast as I can because I have to make a phone call before it gets to be too late alright how are we doing stepped up you guys guys the guy like ripping his teeth out way up let me turn this down a little we've examined the industry and our place in it
[106:38.53]We worked hard to widen our excellent Twitter, engender fiscal aptitude, and re-intermediate intuitive strategies to promote cutting-edge, principle-centered, future-tested, high-impact, end-to-end mononectomy in the center sphere with a total linkage methodology concentration on our player base.
[107:06.50]I thought that was Daniel Radcliffe for a second.
[107:08.08]I was like, how'd they get him?
[107:08.94]This isn't going to work.
[107:10.10]Devolver is like, you need to pay attention.
[107:13.46]Yeah!
[107:30.22]What a play space, am I right?
[107:32.32]A play space that we believe is the future's future.
[107:37.34]Shut your mouths, you miserable piece of human garbage!
[107:44.25]Oh, shit!
[107:47.05]Let's get this nonsense started.
[107:49.27]I read on the internet this one time.
[107:53.01]That some of you had some proper shit to say about our press conference last year.
[107:57.81]That it wasn't professional.
[108:01.13]I gotta make a phone call.
[108:02.35]I can't watch this.
[108:03.72]I gotta go.
[108:05.42]By a real video games publisher, what publishes real video games.
[108:09.56]That it was all some kind of joke.
[108:13.38]Joke.
[108:16.07]Well, you were super wrong.
[108:19.41]And to prove it, we have ramped up this year's Jiminy thinger to include everything that you might expect from a production of this magnitude.
[108:31.51]This year, we have overly flashy graphics to distract you from mundane dialog.
[108:39.05]Guest appearances from personalities that you can recognize.
[108:42.79]Alright, alright, alright.
[108:43.38]I gotta go.
[108:44.04]I gotta go.
[108:44.68]I gotta go.
[108:45.18]Watch it on a different screen.
[108:47.44]I don't want to be talking over... I'm invested.
[108:51.20]It's too bad.
[108:52.60]I gotta go.
[108:53.12]I have to fucking try to... I have to try to have a baby born on stream on Tuesday.
[108:58.17]I gotta go.
[108:59.39]There it is.
[108:59.99]There's the thing I gotta try to get situated.
[109:01.23]I don't have any time.
[109:01.75]Stop.
[109:01.85]Mute the mic and leave it on?
[109:02.55]No, I gotta go.
[109:03.01]We're gonna do the bits.
[109:03.53]I can't like talk over it.
[109:04.33]That's just not gonna work.
[109:34.28]Go watch it.
[109:35.44]She just said a bunch of swears in my ear.
[109:38.06]We're going to do the bits.
[109:45.70]If you want to stick around for the bits, then you can.
[109:48.74]If not, go watch the rest of the conference.
[109:50.18]I'm sure it'll be funny and interesting.
[109:53.46]But I do have to get out of here in the next 30 minutes.
[109:59.21]Thank you for watching.
[110:00.69]Let's do it.
[110:04.24]Thank you, mostly lost for the $1.
[110:05.55]That's how the simulated dialog in the next Saints Row trailer will be.
[110:08.23]Sorry.
[110:14.67]Thank you, Fitty, for the $15.
[110:15.75]Hey, Jerma, good stream.
[110:17.23]That's all.
[110:18.19]Okay, hey, this is Jerma speaking again.
[110:19.63]I'm a big, dumb... Haha, Rat Movie 2.5 is coming out tomorrow.
[110:24.26]Wait, I didn't say that.
[110:25.52]That's all part of the bits message.
[110:26.86]This is seriously not me.
[110:27.82]It still isn't.
[110:30.90]Thanks for the $15, dude.
[110:36.04]Yeah, oh, by all means, take off if you want to watch the conferences.
[110:40.19]The last one here.
[110:45.21]We're just doing the bits.
[110:45.91]We should be able to get through this fairly quickly, so don't worry.
[110:52.17]Go enjoy E3.
[110:54.87]But, thank you, Fitty.
[110:55.93]Thank you, Dust Jonah, for the twats.
[110:58.97]I'm never gonna get this right.
[110:59.99]Hey, sparky your hat - thanks for the one dollar. Imagine unironically buying the putting coin in my guy's butthole toy - by the way I really enjoyed the polygraph stream. Thank you. Thank you spark your hat.
[111:08.99]Thank you snoozing copter for the one dollar. I love how you always fall for the black desert trailers. Have I done that more than once? I may have.
[111:15.99]Thank you sir feline for the one dollar. Jerma you're welcome for me gifting Nightbot a sub because you're such a greedy, compact streamer.
[111:24.49]Hey, thanks, man.
[111:26.39]Thank you.
[111:26.79]Nightbot needs to stay subbed so he can do jermaExpensive.
[111:30.03]Silverflame, thanks for the... Thank you, Jake Sunshine, for the $10.
[111:34.43]Appreciate that, Jake.
[111:35.21]Jeremy, your hair looks really nice today.
[111:37.41]Thank you for turning on the stream, big guy.
[111:40.49]Thank you, Jake, for the $10.
[111:42.13]Appreciate that.
[111:42.65]I need to get a haircut, though.
[111:47.68]That's the third time I've fallen for the Black Desert Online trailer.
[111:51.90]How does it keep happening to me?
[111:55.52]No idea.
[111:58.55]Don't ask me how the fuck I keep falling for that.
[112:02.09]But... Thank you.
[112:03.93]Thank you, uh, Marvesh Magali for the $1.
[112:05.77]The polygraph stream is one of the funniest things you ever did.
[112:08.17]Late congrats for that stream.
[112:09.47]Keep up the great work.
[112:11.19]Thank you.
[112:12.85]More of that kind of shit on the way.
[112:15.83]Very soon.
[112:17.33]Uh, the ace is Chase.
[112:18.11]Thanks for the $5.
[112:18.43]Jeremiah, I love you, but it can be a test in patience watching you play.
[112:23.73]He's talking about destroy all humans?
[112:26.92]Well, good, dude.
[112:27.64]It'll build character.
[112:28.74]You'll have more patience for when you have, like, a son eventually.
[112:32.26]And he, like, wants to get into, like, fucking Play-Doh and put it in his mouth and shit.
[112:35.87]And you're gonna be like, hey, excuse me, don't do that.
[112:38.25]You'll have a lot of patience for your son.
[112:40.03]I'm teaching you patience.
[112:42.25]Wizbiz McBrix, thanks for the ten bucks.
[112:45.13]Jerma, just a friendly reminder that the plague, the actual plague, he's talking about the one that's in Nevada.
[112:49.78]I'm not sure it is.
[112:54.16]But, you know, it could be.
[112:56.77]Thanks for the warning.
[112:57.71]I will watch out.
[112:59.53]T-Poyo, thanks for the $5.
[113:00.81]Hope this is somewhat makes up for the years of watching your YouTube videos with ad block on.
[113:04.45]I'm sorry.
[113:06.32]Don't worry about it.
[113:06.84]It's fine.
[113:08.56]Watching ads sucks, so I can understand.
[113:12.54]Thank you, though.
[113:13.12]Thank you, Amelia for life for the $10 here.
[113:15.48]Thank you.
[113:15.74]Hello, Mr. Jerma.
[113:16.90]I'm a big fan.
[113:17.48]Been watching you and Ster do some TF2 and made me cry a tear of good.
[113:22.88]Love you, buddy.
[113:23.42]Please stay, say shpee or mad.
[113:27.01]K. Thanks, K. What did I miss?
[113:31.44]I missed something?
[113:32.70]Alright, we gotta go.
[113:33.96]But thank you, Amelia.
[113:34.60]Appreciate that.
[113:37.38]Uh, Stormychoo gave $50.
[113:38.56]Thank you so much, Stormychoo, earlier.
[113:40.78]MeatyMatey gave $2.
[113:41.89]Buy yourself a candy bar.
[113:42.91]I will.
[113:43.57]Thank you, Gonderlane, for the $1.
[113:46.17]You should continue your PopCap adventures and try Bookworm Adventures 2.
[113:51.23]The game here where we realize how bad your knowledge of the English fucking lexicon is, since you love PopCap games.
[114:01.14]Thank you, Gondolin.
[114:03.36]Thank you, Spreo, for the $1.
[114:04.34]Alright, well, we see that pregnant E3 stream.
[114:07.06]I'm going to try.
[114:07.60]I'm going to try.
[114:08.56]That's why I have to get out of here.
[114:10.27]I'm going to make a phone call immediately when the stream ends.
[114:13.97]Darkstar, thanks for the $1.
[114:15.13]I tried asking this last time you were live, but we all know how that stream ended.
[114:18.64]I'm about to start a new delivery job this week and was wondering if you or Chad have any music or podcast suggestions.
[114:24.08]Love you.
[114:24.62]Yes, Bill Burr.
[114:27.22]Bill Burr has ran a podcast, I think it's every Monday.
[114:31.75]He just kind of talks, and he's great.
[114:34.87]I haven't listened to it really that recently, but...
[114:38.58]He's always easy to listen to and fun to listen to.
[114:41.92]Besides that, I don't really have many playlists.
[114:45.59]E3.
[114:45.77]You can watch E3.
[114:46.87]Get E3 on your phone.
[114:50.05]Missing bald coin jokes.
[114:52.65]Oh, well.
[114:55.39]But thanks, man.
[114:55.93]Thank you.
[114:56.57]Good luck on your job, by the way.
[114:58.57]Thank you, Topac, for the $1.
[114:59.89]This game is IRLU.
[115:01.55]Crypto, poo-poo, pee-pee, loot, and all-around shit jokes.
[115:05.50]Speaks to me on another level, I think.
[115:07.85]Dark Star, thanks for the $1 again.
[115:09.30]Also, I missed your E3 reaction because I was watching Vinny's reaction.
[115:12.20]Any particular favorite game of what they showed?
[115:15.48]Yes, the logo of Battletoads.
[115:17.96]Because we didn't get to see a game.
[115:19.64]But that.
[115:20.52]So far.
[115:21.86]And Cuphead's DLC.
[115:23.68]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[115:24.92]What can I say?
[115:25.46]I don't know.
[115:28.65]GarfieldTheMondayKiller, thanks for the $1.
[115:30.67]Garfagraph, extra, extra, read all about it.
[115:32.21]We just got it on Muppet Vision 3D, one of Jim Henson's finest works.
[115:35.16]A bit sad hearing Jim voice Kermit one last time.
[115:37.66]Anyway, Jermarino, what's your favorite Muppet?
[115:39.90]Mine's Beaker.
[115:40.60]He's Garfield approved?
[115:41.56]Alright, you'll be happy to hear that The Lion King came out.
[115:45.43]That The Lion King burnt down in a fire?
[115:46.81]What?
[115:47.65]King Kong attraction you hate so much burnt down in a fire.
[115:50.55]They redid the attraction into a 3D 360 tunnel with King Kong saving you from dinosaurs.
[115:56.03]Believe me, Universal used to suck, but now it's Garftacular.
[115:58.49]Thank you, Garfield.
[116:00.53]Appreciate that, man.
[116:02.29]And my favorite Muppet is Gonzo.
[116:04.85]For sure.
[116:06.27]He's so dead inside.
[116:07.79]No.
[116:10.36]No.
[116:11.16]Wow.
[116:12.98]This is what I'm doing right now.
[116:14.12]And I don't know why.
[116:14.84]I don't know why I'm doing this.
[116:17.79]I'm such a nervous wreck right now.
[116:19.89]I gotta go.
[116:20.45]I gotta get out of here.
[116:22.13]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[116:23.49]Space Invaders, thanks, man.
[116:24.63]Amelia for life, thanks for the $5.
[116:25.75]I love you, germs.
[116:27.57]But you made my mummy sad.
[116:29.47]And that is well bad.
[116:30.33]I made a donation message for you, but you didn't pay the due.
[116:36.19]Please go read.
[116:36.91]It was very sweet, but not worth meat.
[116:39.99]Thanks.
[116:42.21]I'm sorry I missed a bit message from you the other night.
[116:44.51]It's hard to pull them back.
[116:48.56]Do the call on stream.
[116:49.63]No, I can't do that.
[116:52.57]Unfortunately, it's hard for me to go back and read bits from other streams.
[116:57.15]I wish I could have a thing where I could permanently save them.
[117:01.79]If you can, I don't know where it is.
[117:03.89]Because I've tried, but thank you.
[117:07.07]Thank you, Hawkeye.
[117:07.75]Mine for the $4.50.
[117:08.53]Here's to another month of subbing.
[117:10.08]Works had me busy, but your shenanigans are always worth being a filthy VOD boy.
[117:14.14]Love the material, Jerm.
[117:14.94]Keep it up.
[117:15.40]Thank you, Hawkeye.
[117:17.38]I plan to.
[117:18.46]We'll see what the future holds.
[117:19.74]Thank you, SirFeline, for the $1.
[117:21.92]What if Jerma is just working with Microsoft and that's why he will only stream their conference?
[117:26.65]Well, I didn't.
[117:27.79]I didn't.
[117:28.11]I streamed the Bethesda conference and like 35 seconds of the Devolver one.
[117:34.98]Thank you, dude.
[117:35.36]Thank you, Niall Orian for the $1.
[117:36.86]Roses aren't cheap.
[117:37.66]Violets were in my dream.
[117:39.26]Jerma sits in a booster seat and dabs off stream.
[117:42.36]In your opinion.
[117:43.12]That's what you should have put at the end there.
[117:44.48]Thank you, Niall.
[117:45.28]Thank you, Casey, for the $1.
[117:46.36]Hey, Jerma, thanks for making my Sunday better.
[117:47.78]Cheers.
[117:48.10]Cheers to you.
[117:48.54]Cheers to that.
[117:50.69]Megario.
[117:51.73]Mega Agro.
[117:53.49]Thanks for the $5.
[117:53.89]Hey, Jerma, would you ever play Ori and the Blind Forest on stream?
[117:58.13]Maybe.
[117:59.65]Maybe.
[118:00.35]Probably not, though.
[118:02.39]Maybe.
[118:02.53]Maybe.
[118:05.81]It does look wonderful, though.
[118:08.05]We'll see.
[118:09.31]Son of Jenova, thanks for the $1.
[118:10.51]Ha ha ha, Far Cry 1.
[118:13.37]I still have to play Far Cry 1, that's correct.
[118:14.89]Thanks for the reminders, Son of Jenova.
[118:17.23]13th Onion, thanks for the $1.
[118:18.47]Ah, Las Vegas, where the streets are paved with clowns.
[118:21.96]Clowns made that city, man.
[118:25.50]The 13th Onion, thanks for the $1 here.
[118:29.50]Taken from somebody who lived in Southern California most of their life.
[118:33.93]You don't want to fly in or out of LAX.
[118:36.88]You use either Bob Hope in Burbank or the Santa Barbara airport.
[118:40.46]Both are a lot easier and less stressful to get in and out of, despite having to drive a bit farther.
[118:44.54]Yeah, that's true.
[118:46.50]I've flown into LAX and out of LAX probably a dozen times now, and it's been terrible pretty much every time.
[118:53.04]And the only other airport I've gone to was the Long Beach airport.
[118:59.66]If that makes any sense.
[119:00.88]Yes, it sucks.
[119:03.41]Thank you, Bob Boy for the... For the $1.60.
[119:06.67]Appreciate that.
[119:09.96]And it says, I used to work at Subway.
[119:12.04]No, wait, that's not even true.
[119:16.12]I just melded you together with somebody.
[119:20.17]But Bob Boy, yes, I actually opened it up on stream.
[119:22.57]The pre-stream party document.
[119:25.49]We looked it up on stream.
[119:26.71]It was a little messy.
[119:28.68]But thank you, Casey, for the $1.
[119:30.08]I used to work at Subway and a man came in to order a footlong meatball sub.
[119:34.06]What he actually said was a football meat log.
[119:36.66]I laughed, he paid, and I never saw him again.
[119:44.56]Thank you, SticksRenegade, for the $1.
[119:46.09]I bet a hundred bits that you have a thousand more viewers than usual because you have Bethesda in your title.
[119:52.55]I mean, that's probably... That might be true.
[119:56.50]That might be true.
[119:58.64]There was a lot of people here over these... The... Last... Like, eight hours here.
[120:05.20]Thanks for... Thanks for choosing me as your E3... Co-pilot.
[120:10.84]Appreciate it, guys.
[120:11.48]Thank you.
[120:13.20]Thank you, Casey, for the $1.
[120:15.32]I was watching some of your PSVR streams and it inspired me to buy one.
[120:18.72]Since they are on sale right now.
[120:20.52]Can't wait for Tetris Effect.
[120:23.28]Yeah, the PSVR at $4.99 was a little expensive.
[120:25.78]The PSVR at, like, $2.99 is a good buy.
[120:30.64]It just kind of is.
[120:32.54]It's still expensive, but it's way better than it was before.
[120:34.76]It's, like, too... The other one.
[120:42.15]My donation document.
[120:43.09]Yeah, we opened it up on stream.
[120:44.51]It was the thing with, like, the... Everyone was, like, typing and correcting and deleting shit.
[120:48.67]Wasn't that it?

[121:20.00]Uh, it's a link and it says, you asked why you were still alive looking at it.

[121:25.31]I had a ton of fun playing with you.
[121:26.39]Thanks for the trip.
[121:27.61]What is this?
[121:31.43]What is this?
[121:34.45]Oh, it's one of my videos.

[121:59.32]Well, thanks.
[121:59.86]Thank you, Bobboy.
[122:03.59]We're almost done.
[122:04.21]Don't worry.
[122:04.57]I'm out of here.
[122:05.03]We're almost done.
[122:06.63]Thank you, SuperSilverTheOneDollar.
[122:07.91]If you ever wanted to be a generic streamer and make jermaPog, this would be the perfect one.
[122:22.87]I look like a fucking fish in this picture.
[122:26.07]My lord.
[122:28.12]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[122:29.46]Jerma, nice job getting on the Bethesda E3 showcase.
[122:33.82]PogChamp.
[122:34.38]What?
[122:36.18]Did I?
[122:37.68]I was really mean.
[122:39.44]All in good fun, though.
[122:40.13]I love that company.
[122:40.79]They make great video games.
[122:41.93]Thank you, Smelly Boy, for the $1.
[122:43.29]These Bethesda robots are exactly like Red Letter Media's spoof of nerd shills.
[122:51.31]Thank you, Rytanic, for the $1.
[122:52.71]What the literal fuck?
[122:54.57]I don't know.
[122:55.51]Snooze and Copter, thanks for the $1.
[122:56.85]Jeremy predicted the air guitar and we got a full concert.
[123:00.38]That counts, right?
[123:02.98]It has to count for something.
[123:05.52]Stix Renegade, thanks for the $1.
[123:06.78]Can they just ban musical performances and gaming conferences, please?
[123:11.12]Yeah, I do.
[123:12.37]Alright.
[123:14.01]There actually was really no point for Andrew WK to be here.
[123:19.22]It was just kind of like, alright, I remember that guy.
[123:21.66]Yeah, he... He was like a party guy and he made like music, I guess.
[123:29.56]Oh shit, my outro.
[123:31.02]I don't know, it's weird.
[123:34.04]Thank you, Dunkey Arisen for the $1.
[123:35.68]Hey, Jermbo, I love you, man, and I have two important things to say.
[123:38.06]First off, you broke your all-time view record tonight.
[123:41.84]Almost 7,000 people at once.
[123:44.74]What?
[123:44.90]What?
[123:47.54]There was 7,000 fucking people here?
[123:49.40]When?
[123:50.42]When did that happen?
[123:56.12]Jesus.
[123:57.12]Did that actually happen?
[124:01.12]Well, that's cool.
[124:03.12]Yeah, it was not that.
[124:04.46]Well, if it was, that's... Yeah, that's more than I've ever had.
[124:08.50]I think the most I've ever had was during one of the Jerm of Rumbles on stream.
[124:15.17]At the beginning of the Bethesda, you had almost 8,000.
[124:18.76]Where'd they all go?
[124:19.40]What happened?
[124:24.44]What did I say?
[124:25.16]I must have said something bad.
[124:31.87]Apparently, 3 or 4 thousand people decided to leave.
[124:41.09]bunch of Bethesda bots.
[124:43.11]They got tired of the laugh tracks.
[124:44.61]They may have, oh well.
[124:46.63]I tried.
[124:49.13]Secondly, I want to see you suffer.
[124:50.74]Please watch this entire video and give commentary.
[124:56.98]No, I can't.
[124:58.12]I can't watch this video.
[124:59.06]It's like three minutes.
[125:00.66]I've already seen it though.
[125:01.42]It's me as like Professor Spearmans.
[125:05.62]Smithans.
[125:06.12]What's his name?
[125:07.79]Principal...
[125:10.03]The Simpsons principle, you know?
[125:11.35]It's me doing, like, jock shockers.
[125:14.53]It's a good video.
[125:15.53]You go ahead and watch it sometime.
[125:17.07]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1 guarantee.
[125:18.77]90% of these people have no idea what the hell Quake even is.
[125:21.83]It's possible.
[125:24.19]Was I too mean?
[125:25.83]I don't think I was, but I should have put, like, this is a joke in the corner or something, right?
[125:31.13]Like, I'm just messing around.
[125:32.05]Like, I love Bethesda.
[125:33.01]Shouldn't I write that?
[125:36.16]Almost done bottoming.
[125:36.92]It's been thanks for the five dollars whose idea was it to buy the mugs though.
[125:39.74]I need to know It was just all it was at a store and we was like oh well I can just get one for me and get one we can give a review and whatever we'll know whose cup it is I Don't know
[125:50.99]I don't know.
[125:51.65]We were just at a store.
[125:52.71]We saw it.
[125:53.11]We were like, good, bye.
[125:55.45]Nothing else was really there.
[125:57.43]Thank you, though.
[125:57.93]Thank you, soul son of a bitch, for the $1.
[126:01.18]Player.placeatme00104C7F10.
[126:03.26]I don't know what that is, but thank you.
[126:08.52]Thank you, Sir Feline, for the $1.
[126:09.88]I find it very funny that they refuse to acknowledge New Vegas because it's better than theirs.
[126:18.39]Yeah, it really is kind of too bad that we'll probably never see an Obsidian Fallout ever again.
[126:26.89]But, it's all good.
[126:30.41]They're making other stuff.
[126:32.13]Oh, that's Easy Pete.
[126:32.87]Okay, well, then, yeah, absolutely.
[126:35.01]Snooze and Cofter, thanks for the $1.
[126:36.39]Todd didn't clap, so where's my money?
[126:38.21]He did, actually.
[126:38.85]He came out and he did one big clap, but he didn't do the inhale.
[126:42.25]So, I lost.
[126:44.39]Thank you to Sir Phelan again for the $1.
[126:46.76]Jerma, time for you to pay up.
[126:49.24]I told you it was gonna be funny money, so, like, here, I just distributed it.
[126:52.08]It happened right now.
[126:54.78]Dubsky, dude, thanks for the $1.
[126:56.08]Holy shit.
[126:57.36]Was E3 a dumpster fire?
[126:59.44]Especially Bethesda.
[127:00.30]What were they thinking?
[127:03.30]that fallout multiplayer game will probably be pretty fun at least for a little while sure they're trying to jump on like the open world survival hey play and watch out for that random guy that's inside that house trying to get the bottle of random pills in the in the cabinet to fend off his radiation you're trying to do that too now there's a fight I mean yeah but I'm sure it'll be interesting
[127:29.52]Thank you, though.
[127:30.80]My voice is starting to go down.
[127:34.32]Son of Jenova, thanks for the $1.
[127:35.46]This stream was awesome, Jermbo.
[127:36.56]Also, I'm hyped for the new ESO now.
[127:39.37]Love ya.
[127:42.41]Never got a chance to play it.
[127:44.87]But if you like it, more power to you.
[127:47.89]Glad you do.
[127:50.87]L Mushroom, thanks for the $1.
[127:52.17]Jerma, could you go again, please?
[127:53.77]You mispronounced my name.
[127:55.72]I just got it right there.
[127:57.34]L Mushroom, thank you for the sub and thank you for the bits.
[128:01.92]uh ermine thank you for the five dollars Jerm I don't remember if I've asked this question before but it's really important to me can you drive a manual transmission I have nope I have no idea if you put me in a manual car and you said drive a mile down the road I would explode the car I would give you probably three or four thousand dollars in damage to that car no I do not know
[128:33.17]Thank you, Orthocone, for the $1, literally just to prevent you from ending.
[128:36.09]And that means we're getting close.
[128:38.47]Thank you, Bobrip, for the $1.53.
[128:41.69]No message, that's all.
[128:43.02]Thank you, SirFeline, for the $1.
[128:44.54]No message, thank you.
[128:46.54]Bobboy, thanks for the $1.
[128:49.30]This is the dock, not the pre- Okay, here, let's see what this is.
[128:52.82]Let's open it.
[128:56.42]The pre-stream dock is the one with the people typing wildly.
[128:58.94]Alright, well, what the hell is this?
[129:01.94]Is this the thing with the fruits, or is this something else?
[129:03.74]Alright, what is this?
[129:10.27]Alright, uh... Can I read this off stream?
[129:21.38]This is like a picture of my face with a bow tie.
[129:23.36]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to episode one of JermaCraft.
[129:27.88]Hi, Jerma.
[129:28.22]I'm going to use this donation as a clarification for a donation I made for the recent TF2 stream.
[129:33.08]When I said I am Bob-Boy in that one, I meant I was the medic on Upward.
[129:37.22]I tried... Alright, well, shit's just getting deleted.
[129:41.37]I... Uh, I... Even I put two Ubers on you.
[129:47.41]I was also able to join you on... I'd like to meet you in real life, seeing as I live about two hours away from you.
[129:53.87]I've been a fan for a while, and you've been consistently... These people keep typing shit.
[130:00.10]Stream Half-Life 2 is the request.
[130:03.65]With the facecam on.
[130:07.43]I can't... People keep fucking deleting things and adding things.
[130:16.26]Redonated with 100 bits in case the link doesn't work.
[130:18.72]Redonated with 1,000 bits to beat KXZ.
[130:28.62]Just view it rather than have it on suggestions?
[130:33.26]Oh, okay.
[130:35.94]But, alright, to answer the question here, then you scroll down and there's, like, there's a bunch of, like, pictures of my, like, meme faces.
[130:41.28]I'm gonna call them that.
[130:44.66]Alright, but yeah, so to answer the Half-Life 2 with a facecam will probably never happen.
[130:48.64]I don't want to get your hopes up, but it probably won't.
[130:52.32]uh meeting in real life I go to conventions all the time you go to one um probably gonna I'm moving far away in the next like 30 days here so come out to a convention sometimes I'll shake your hand I'll give you a like a hey what's up dude oh thank you Bob boy do a handstand on facecam
[131:20.60]30 days yeah I'm trying to get out of here as soon as possible Devolver just ended but then I wouldn't have been able to do the bits I'm not going to talk over a whole conference that's that would be like really annoying I think plus we're almost done so just pretend like you just this was the Devolver conference but only a few more here thank you zero call for the two bucks Devolver just announced a new FromSoftware game I'm not even kidding
[131:46.91]Did they really?
[131:47.41]I'm gonna have to look at that after this stream.
[131:48.53]Thank you, Garfield, the Monday Killer for the $1.
[131:50.19]I thought the age of Jerma rushing through my bits was over.
[131:53.24]I only donated once, but my Garfer graphs are still Skibidi-skipped.
[131:57.80]Does Jerma really hate the Garf, the Monday Clippity Killer?
[132:01.22]Tell me it isn't so.
[132:02.07]Say you tolerate me, Jerma.
[132:03.25]Love is a strong word.
[132:04.17]I'm not ready for that kind of commitment.
[132:06.79]Yes, Garfield, we love you.
[132:11.90]And the last two here.
[132:12.92]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[132:14.08]Thanks for the funny money.
[132:15.14]Appreciate you sticking to your word.
[132:17.52]You're welcome.
[132:18.14]Thank you.
[132:18.90]And Clueless Sniper.
[132:21.42]All the way at the end here.
[132:22.88]Thank you for the $1.
[132:23.70]Buy loot box coin.
[132:24.85]What are they doing?
[132:26.95]Are they doing like an ICO?
[132:30.15]Jesus Christ.
[132:32.83]Alright, enjoy the rest of E3.
[132:34.87]I'll see you on Tuesday.
[132:36.73]Or there might be a freak accident where I have to stream tomorrow.
[132:39.75]I don't know.
[132:40.33]I'm gonna try to work my ass off right now until Tuesday.
[132:43.50]So, good night, good luck, take care.
[132:46.28]Thank you, Zeno Coal.
[132:48.70]Zero Coal for the $1 right at the end.
[132:51.98]And here's the status of announcing Metal Wolf Chaos, an updated version of FromSoftware's 2004 Xbox release.
[133:00.04]Alright, that's fucking pretty cool.
[133:01.40]Nice.
[133:03.41]But thanks, everybody.
[133:04.65]Have a great rest of your night.
[133:05.72]Thanks for sticking around over seven and a half hours.
[133:08.63]See you on Tuesday.
[133:10.53]Good night.
