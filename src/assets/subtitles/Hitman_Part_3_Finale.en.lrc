[01:49.68]I swear to God, every time I turn my microphone on, my dog is eating a biscuit.
[01:58.38]I think that's happened at least the last three times I've streamed.
[02:04.00]Let's turn the microphone off.
[02:05.76]It seems to happen every time.
[02:13.40]But, hi.
[02:14.77]What's going on?
[02:19.08]Give me two more minutes.
[02:21.06]This is an off-schedule stream.
[02:23.04]Not scheduled to do this.
[02:26.20]But that's what we're going to do.
[02:28.45]I wanted to finish Hitman, really, before the next week started.
[02:33.25]Because I want to close the book on this game, at least on stream.
[02:38.39]I might play it off-stream.
[02:40.79]I don't know.
[02:43.15]Give me two more minutes.
[03:22.16]Wait, what?
[03:31.95]Wait, what?
[03:54.45]Hey, we're back, we're back.
[03:58.65]We're live.
[03:59.44]And Never Trust a Purple, thank you for the thousand bits.
[04:04.28]Secret stream, this is pretty secret.
[04:07.78]Not totally secret, but secret enough.
[04:13.47]I want to do this, though.
[04:14.09]I want to get in the habit of having three scheduled days.
[04:19.77]And then maybe once or twice a week, that off schedule happened.
[04:24.07]But you don't know.
[04:26.89]I like to be unpredictable in my off schedule days.
[04:31.09]And it is fucking cold in this room.
[04:33.76]It is like so cold in here.
[04:35.38]I don't know if you could like tell by my voice, but it's like this.
[04:42.12]That's the worst thing about having an office.
[04:44.04]I work down in my basement, right?
[04:47.83]So I have a basement that I turned into an office.
[04:51.00]But something because I'm a smart person.
[04:53.38]I didn't... I have forced hot air.
[04:56.78]So there's no heating ventilation down here in the basement.
[05:02.01]All I have down here is I have this little fucking space heater.
[05:06.55]It's not little, it's big.
[05:08.61]But it takes like...
[05:10.60]It takes like a good like hour and a half before the room actually heats up.
[05:14.08]And I got down here maybe like 40 minutes ago.
[05:16.32]So it's a little bit toasty in here.
[05:19.38]Reverse of that.
[05:20.16]It's a little bit chilly.
[05:23.34]Turn on face cam?
[05:25.10]No.
[05:27.62]But we have one mission left to do.
[05:30.52]Here's to 9,000 more bits gained through ads.
[05:32.91]No thanks, man.
[05:36.51]Also, thank you to Blue Kunu and Rick Bilby for five months and two months respectively.
[05:40.07]Jerma, if you could be a doggy, would you be a Rottweiler or a big doggy?
[05:46.31]Is it a Rottweiler big?
[05:49.48]I thought Rottweilers were big.
[05:55.22]Jerma, the sub in BitsTech is too small, is it?
[05:57.26]Let me change it.
[06:00.88]Thing is, I want to make it big enough where you can see it, but not so it takes up like the whole screen.
[06:08.34]Maybe that'll be better.
[06:11.36]Right like there.
[06:12.22]Because those are changing here eventually.
[06:17.32]But they've been a little big.
[06:18.42]How's that?
[06:19.28]Better?
[06:24.22]Oh, by the way, are we in sync?
[06:25.08]Because we like to make sure we're in sync when we play Hitman.
[06:30.08]Alright, ready?
[06:30.37]Here we go.
[06:31.55]Wait, what?
[06:37.63]Synced?
[06:38.97]I hope so.
[06:41.29]If not, then I'm going to be in big trouble.
[06:46.58]Assassinate Glue Man?
[06:49.04]No way.
[06:49.50]I'm not going to kill Glue Man.
[06:53.88]If the next mission was to kill Glue Man, I would just quit the game.
[07:01.37]It's in sync.
[07:01.81]Good.
[07:02.07]Okay.
[07:03.07]So we're going to get started.
[07:04.87]Thank you, BossySoup, for seven months.
[07:07.19]I also couldn't, like, last stream, a bunch of people subbed and resubbed it.
[07:12.56]I didn't even see them because the stream, like, crashed, right?
[07:15.88]Didn't the stream, like, end because I had to crash the game on it?
[07:20.42]So one of my streams on a highlight from livestream fails.
[07:24.92]Well, I'll probably be on there quite a bit.
[07:29.36]So, what do you want me to tell you?
[07:32.25]Like, I can't believe I'm on that sub.
[07:35.97]I'm not a failure.
[07:37.57]No, I do tend to fuck up.
[07:39.65]And it's live on camera and I can't change it.
[07:41.41]So, it's all good.
[07:44.20]Hope you have a good laugh.
[07:45.24]I hope you do.
[07:46.68]At least you get some enjoyment out of it, I hope.
[07:50.92]But thank you, Gecko Manchild and Shibisara.
[07:53.15]Shibisara.
[07:54.03]No, Shibi2142 Sarah.
[07:59.48]Okay, here comes a loud cutscene.
[08:00.74]This is the last mission.
[08:01.62]I just wanted to... Because I knew I wasn't going to do this on a scheduled screen again, so I kind of wanted to just get it out of the way off schedule.
[08:12.05]So we're going to push the button, sit back, relax, and watch me probably do terrible at the last mission of Hitman Season 1.
[08:21.78]Good morning, boy.
[08:22.64]Just kidding.
[08:23.08]We're skipping it.
[08:23.56]I...
[08:29.95]I can't, hold on.
[08:32.45]Got it, okay.
[08:32.87]So we gotta break into a medical facility and kill the guy, got it.
[08:35.57]Okay, uh, that sounds like good.
[08:56.00]This contract takes place in a highly secure area.
[08:57.97]As such, Agent 47 is unable to arrive carrying any weapons.
[09:02.43]Oh, boy.
[09:03.55]I don't get anything?
[09:09.12]Tonight is the super moon, but it is cloudy tonight, so I have to turn to Germa for the giant... Why is that censored?
[09:14.90]The giant penis or something?
[09:16.19]What does it say?
[09:17.29]Thank you, radio.
[09:23.20]Okay, let's... I can't really do anything, so can I change my starting location?
[09:28.78]No.
[09:33.22]Please, I love the cutscenes.
[09:37.46]Yeah, I... Alright, fine.
[09:39.84]No, it's too late.
[09:42.90]We've got to break into this facility.
[09:44.66]This guy is going to have heart surgery.
[09:46.14]We've got to kill him.
[09:47.64]And then his daughter is going to try to get in our way.
[09:51.95]And we have to get rid of her.
[10:07.31]How's that?
[10:08.47]A little bit better.
[10:11.07]Maybe.
[10:11.33]Yeah.
[10:12.47]All right.
[10:19.11]We're just going to play it.
[10:25.88]Metallics, you got it.
[10:26.60]I can see it.
[10:28.34]That's two full Jupyters in a row.
[10:31.67]How do you guys do these things?
[10:38.75]But let's get started.
[10:39.63]Let's get going.
[10:41.37]Here's the only cutscene you guys need to see.
[10:43.45]Welcome to Hokkaido 47.
[10:44.87]The Gama Private Hospital provides cutting-edge medical treatment for the global elite, outside the law, if required.
[10:52.97]The facility is partially run by an artificial intelligence system known as KAI.
[10:58.02]The AI oversees patient admission to various areas of the hospital, and even participates in some medical procedures.
[11:05.65]You will find Eric Sodas in the operating theater undergoing a pre-surgery regenerative stem cell treatment.
[11:13.19]A highly controversial procedure yet to be approved by Japanese authorities.
[11:18.24]Yuki Yamazaki has already arrived.
[11:20.60]You'll find her in her suite or roaming the restaurant and spa areas of the hospital.
[11:24.96]All I care about is I gotta get rid of these two people.
[11:27.78]Get rid of them.
[11:28.92]That's all I care about.
[11:29.50]Let us make sure he stays that way.
[11:31.98]Good luck, 47.
[11:32.36]For a second I thought I was dead.
[11:41.59]Yeah.
[11:47.95]But I just don't feel like it today.
[11:52.68]I just want to lie here.
[11:56.30]Nap time, yeah.
[12:05.07]Alright, get up.
[12:05.67]Whoa.
[12:10.51]Your personal robe has been outfitted with a radio frequency identification chip What?
[12:17.43]The device will unlock and allow access to your personal suite Okay Look at this view Please do not jump over the balcony
[12:38.32]Alright, let me get up here.
[12:40.08]I can't do anything with that right now.
[12:43.61]What do we got for intel?
[12:44.29]It's important.
[12:46.57]Opportunities.
[12:47.87]Ghost in the Machine.
[12:49.49]The guy with the itchy ass.
[12:51.41]Bandage Head.
[12:53.35]Resident Evil 3.
[12:56.96]Sia.
[12:57.46]The singer Sia.
[13:00.50]This one.
[13:02.86]Yeah.
[13:03.64]Definitely this one.
[13:04.34]Telltale Heart.
[13:05.44]Track it.
[13:08.96]How long am I going to stream tonight?
[13:10.08]I mean, I just planned on completing Hitman.
[13:14.58]So I don't know what I'm going to do.
[13:16.06]I might keep going.
[13:16.90]I don't know.
[13:17.86]This is an off-schedule stream.
[13:18.98]I just wanted to get this out of the way.
[13:20.73]So I could... Say I completed the campaign.
[13:25.37]Unlock.
[13:27.57]Can I drown somebody in a bathtub?
[13:31.65]No.
[13:31.97]Alright.
[13:32.59]Let me just go to the opportunity.
[13:34.38]Let me go to the attack of opportunity.
[13:40.11]Tamper with the toilet?
[13:45.35]Just plays, like, funny music?
[13:48.96]Please tell me I can do that to somebody while they're sitting on it.
[13:50.92]Alright, did I just win the jackpot at a slot machine, or is this a toilet?
[13:59.68]Oh, speaking of slot machines, speaking of... I can't wait to go back to the casino.
[14:05.50]Okay, I need to go this way.
[14:08.80]How's auto?
[14:09.36]Auto is great.
[14:12.49]He is fantastic.
[14:13.69]Hack!
[14:15.57]Well, I don't have any equipment.
[14:17.09]Can I go up this way?
[14:17.81]Do I have to bow too?
[14:19.91]I think I do.
[14:20.97]I think it's like part of Japanese culture.
[14:22.19]How do I... What are the emotes?
[14:27.74]Okay.
[14:35.40]Gotta do some slots.
[14:36.70]Yeah.
[14:37.28]Okay.
[14:37.54]Yep.
[14:44.80]I kind of like this mission already.
[14:47.01]I like the atmosphere.
[14:50.75]Sushi?
[14:51.21]Oh, I hate sushi!
[14:53.59]No, I don't want to eat this.
[14:56.77]I'm just going to look at it.
[15:00.53]Which one of these do I want to eat?
[15:02.28]Do I want the left one or the middle one?
[15:04.56]I'm not so sure.
[15:05.52]I love how that's blending in.
[15:09.94]Seaweed therapy is this way, right?
[15:12.72]Okay.
[15:18.34]I'm so tempted just to like shove somebody.
[15:20.78]Stop blending it.
[15:21.82]Not allowed to go that way.
[15:25.38]Didn't he just tell me it was right this way?
[15:28.10]Right this way, sure.
[15:28.92]Okay, well, is there another way?
[15:34.02]I can go with the front door.
[15:36.64]Skips all the cutscenes in the lore.
[15:38.92]Oh, I love the atmosphere.
[15:41.08]I do.
[15:42.20]You don't have to fucking watch cutscenes to know that this place is cool.
[15:49.07]This is the newest spawn too.
[15:49.85]This came out like two weeks ago.
[15:52.25]Not even.
[15:52.56]I think I can get rid of this guy.
[15:55.32]Can I?
[15:55.94]Is anybody looking?
[15:58.44]Turn off bridge.
[15:59.20]Let me save this.
[16:02.10]Just in case something goes really horribly wrong.
[16:08.64]Turn off the lights.
[16:13.42]What did that even do?
[16:22.64]Who saw that?
[16:23.14]He saw that.
[16:24.10]What the hell went down here?
[16:26.86]Go, go, go, go, go.
[16:30.71]Now let me get by the sushi bar.
[16:43.58]Wait, I might be able to do this.
[16:44.72]No.
[16:44.88]Late 30s?
[16:45.18]God, Hitman is late 30s?
[16:46.06]I thought he was like 48.
[16:47.44]I think I can actually go this way now, though.
[16:50.09]Right?
[17:10.02]Sorry, sir.
[17:10.74]Can't let you through here.
[17:11.96]Not happening.
[17:13.88]That is Yuki Yamazaki.
[17:15.88]There she is.
[17:16.36]Okay.
[17:16.60]Former lawyer to the Yakuza.
[17:18.33]Okay.
[17:19.21]I need you to stay calm.
[17:21.77]Just get out of my way, okay?
[17:25.41]What is going on?
[17:28.77]No one's gonna see it.
[17:30.05]Nobody's gonna see it.
[17:30.83]Fucking smash her head with the door.
[17:33.90]Just let the pros do their jobs, okay?
[17:37.96]Dude, you strangle one guy and all of a sudden the whole place goes on lockdown.
[17:47.22]No, I'm not going to kill her yet.
[17:48.42]I can't.
[17:49.12]I'm going to just go this way.
[17:52.89]Fuck it.
[17:54.89]Can't go that way.
[17:55.87]Can I wrap around this way?
[18:00.99]I think I might actually be able to come through here, right?
[18:03.11]Because I'm like an employee.
[18:06.31]Yeah?
[18:07.47]Yeah.
[18:09.90]Alright.
[18:10.70]Where can I get a weapon?
[18:13.44]Soda can.
[18:14.04]That's all I need.
[18:14.68]I just need a soda can and I'll be good to go.
[18:21.03]No, don't turn the fuse box off.
[18:22.63]This is a free kill right here.
[18:24.89]If I've ever seen one.
[18:27.58]But that would be not a good idea.
[18:29.38]I kind of need his disguise.
[18:40.51]Who saw that?
[18:40.87]There's nobody even here.
[18:42.93]Mr. Jason Portman, please come to the hospital entrance.
[18:49.46]A doctor will escort you to your checkup.
[18:50.84]I can stop him in here.
[18:51.38]Come here.
[18:52.96]That was for Mr. Jason Portman.
[18:57.52]A doctor will escort you to your appointment.
[19:01.16]Please proceed to the hospital entrance.
[19:05.92]Drag him in.
[19:07.20]There he goes.
[19:07.68]All right, we're good.
[19:12.37]Handyman.
[19:12.89]Now I can be a security guard.
[19:14.49]And there's the weapon.
[19:15.23]Still got a soda can.
[19:20.49]And I should be able to wrap all the way up around and mess with the guy's fake heart, right?
[19:24.55]Oh, shit.
[19:27.09]This guy's asleep.
[19:43.26]There's always more soda cans?
[19:43.88]Wait.
[19:43.98]I just passed that guy.
[19:44.52]Alright, we're going to try that one because I'm right next to him.
[20:09.38]I gotta sneak around though.
[20:12.10]Don't poison that.
[20:13.04]Nothing else I can do in here.
[20:13.86]I think I'm just gonna knock this guy out just because.
[20:24.45]He was like not ready for that.
[20:27.29]He was not ready for that.
[20:33.04]He got him.
[20:34.10]Oh shit.
[20:35.48]Knock him out.
[20:36.16]Jesus.
[20:43.18]Surgeon with trembling hands?
[20:44.46]Yeah, I know, really.
[20:45.24]I just don't want that guy to be any part of this.
[20:50.16]He's right here.
[20:50.72]What does that mean he has trembling hands?
[20:56.98]Is this a drug deal for the doctor?
[21:06.49]Snap his neck?
[21:07.07]No.
[21:07.57]I'm trying not to kill anybody that I don't need to.
[21:10.47]I get zero points when I do that.
[21:18.19]Now, where does he go?
[21:18.93]Obviously, I need to follow him.
[21:24.43]Where?
[21:25.05]Can you come back down here?
[21:28.19]Yeah.
[21:29.13]I can take care of him.
[21:33.35]This is a clear exit down here.
[21:34.65]This is a good exit strategy.
[21:35.51]He's going to walk down here.
[21:36.33]And I'm going to lure him into this room.
[21:40.85]Actually, I don't even need to.
[21:41.87]I can just kill him right here.
[21:46.00]Didn't I snap the first guy's neck?
[21:47.28]No, I did not.
[21:48.72]If I did, it was on accident.
[21:49.76]Alright, no.
[21:50.36]Hey, hello!
[21:52.44]Hey, sir.
[21:57.73]Huh?
[21:58.45]My bad, sir.
[21:59.77]It was your fault.
[22:00.45]I didn't do anything.
[22:01.33]It was you that did that.
[22:04.89]Fucking idiot!
[22:05.43]Alright, I'm dressed as the drug pilot.
[22:15.10]Can he fit in here with this guy?
[22:19.08]Get in there.
[22:20.32]You two can share a room.
[22:26.28]Meet with the chief surgeon.
[22:30.11]He's right up there.
[22:33.11]I love the judo chop.
[22:34.33]The Austin Powers judo chop is amazing.
[22:37.25]Alright, where's the chief surgeon?
[22:43.72]It's going to be right here.
[22:44.56]Wait for the chief surgeon.
[22:47.62]Is that the chief surgeon?
[22:54.84]I kind of want to whip out the soda can.
[23:01.82]That's not the chief surgeon, is it?
[23:03.08]No.
[23:03.62]That's like a mechanic.
[23:04.42]Okay, how long does it take this guy to get here?
[23:15.48]Who is sleeping?
[23:19.20]There's a guy that's just sleeping over there, and he's the first one that's gonna die.
[23:22.29]It's gonna be so easy.
[23:27.13]Take your time.
[23:32.89]This is all too quiet.
[23:35.13]Nels, I, uh, need another pill.
[23:38.93]The effect is waning.
[23:40.65]This way, Doc.
[23:42.25]I'll show you where my stash is.
[23:44.05]Hey, I get it.
[23:45.67]You're not an errand boy.
[23:47.59]Lead the way.
[23:48.41]I get to be the chief surgeon?
[23:49.57]This is going to be amazing.
[23:50.53]I can't wait to just kill a guy that's supposed to be trusting that I'm not going to kill him in surgery.
[23:55.96]Oh, that's terrible.
[23:56.64]My father flew helicopters.
[23:58.34]Horrible thing to say.
[24:00.00]A very brutish fellow.
[24:02.64]Me?
[24:03.00]I'm a lot more refined.
[24:09.40]I wanted to do it so bad.
[24:11.76]Before he got down here, I was going to try to do it.
[24:13.70]Oh, shit.
[24:14.22]Why is this the kill room?
[24:16.74]Come on in.
[24:17.08]I've killed three people in this room now.
[24:18.92]I have my secret smash.
[24:23.92]Crime noticed by who?
[24:24.68]No!
[24:24.74]No!
[24:24.80]No, shit!
[24:25.08]Why did I do that?
[24:36.62]I just freaked the fuck out.
[24:39.08]What do I do?
[24:39.42]I'm freaking out.
[24:42.90]The fucking kill room.
[24:44.04]What have you body found?
[24:49.02]Did you see that guy?
[24:51.36]Okay, shit.
[24:53.29]What if I just hide behind the chair?
[24:59.27]I'm just gonna stand here.
[25:03.43]They're not gonna think it's me if I literally stand still.
[25:05.65]It's just...
[25:08.34]Like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
[25:13.60]If you don't move, they won't even know you exist.
[25:17.77]It's a good thing that they think... That guy's not going to come in here.
[25:24.69]He won't fit in the closet.
[25:25.45]There's too many people in the closet.
[25:26.47]This is the kill room.
[25:27.33]Two people are already in there.
[25:29.09]I can't put a third one in there, can I?
[25:30.27]Can I stuff three people in there?
[25:31.31]Alright, he's leaving.
[25:32.65]Look at the map.
[25:33.73]He's gone.
[25:35.69]Crisis averted.
[25:36.57]We're good.
[25:38.76]Well done, 47.
[25:39.16]This should provide you with the means to get close to sodas.
[25:44.24]It's full.
[25:51.78]Well, I just hope nobody comes in here.
[25:58.00]Where is he going?
[26:02.32]Okay, lady.
[26:03.30]Time to rock and roll.
[26:04.58]Copy.
[26:09.23]Get in here.
[26:09.63]Get in the kill room.
[26:11.01]This is only one room where people have to be.
[26:13.33]Get in here.
[26:16.66]Get this too.
[26:17.20]What is that?
[26:18.68]Can I not pick this up?
[26:29.32]How many people can I fit in here?
[26:33.46]How come they won't come in here?
[26:36.37]Command.
[26:39.31]I wanna try to get, like, ten people in here.
[27:01.26]Here's the funny part.
[27:02.08]All these guys are gonna wake up and be like, what the fuck happened?
[27:05.30]Was there an earthquake?
[27:08.17]Alright, I'm good.
[27:09.45]Let's go.
[27:13.01]We're fine.
[27:19.89]Didn't have to kill anybody.
[27:30.04]That guy can see through.
[27:31.10]That's not good.
[27:31.78]There he is.
[27:38.35]Save it.
[27:41.45]Former training director at the ICA.
[27:44.29]Regrettable.
[27:45.33]I killed one person on accident.
[27:46.79]It wasn't even for real.
[27:47.49]Is that a turn-off respirator?
[27:55.40]I just want to see.
[27:58.46]Hey, I'm the new chief surgeon.
[28:01.42]Yeah, I'm here to fix him.
[28:04.51]Fixed him.
[28:06.39]He'll be alright.
[28:07.35]How did they not know that was me?
[28:10.85]How did they not know that was me?
[28:12.43]I walked in there and shot him with a gun.
[28:14.69]No fucking way.
[28:15.23]How am I still walking around?
[28:30.80]How am I not found out?
[28:32.18]That doesn't make any sense.
[28:36.34]Any information on what the perp looks like?
[28:37.90]Unbelievable.
[28:39.08]There's no way this is gonna work.
[28:44.20]Maybe I don't need to redo it.
[28:51.58]No, I have to.
[28:52.23]That's like lame.
[28:53.13]I walked in and just shot him.
[28:55.33]But I'm gonna get away with this.
[28:56.45]That's the sad part.
[29:02.98]I'm definitely gonna get away with it.
[29:03.90]I wanted to come out and shoot him.
[29:09.86]No, this is so dumb.
[29:10.88]Alright, let's do it right.
[29:12.31]Let's do it right.
[29:34.96]He's possibly armed.
[29:37.78]There's a guy lying on the operating table with a bullet in his head.
[29:43.66]The guy might be armed.
[29:45.66]Okay, I can turn off his respirator, but wouldn't she know about it?
[29:50.99]Wait, what?
[29:54.59]I think she needs to leave the room.
[29:58.55]Although there's this thing in here.
[29:59.53]Let me see what this thing does.
[30:01.21]What if I just turn this off?
[30:03.37]Let's try it.
[30:05.34]Turn off his respirator.
[30:08.84]And... Okay.
[30:10.78]So that's the other machine.
[30:15.46]So the other machine will bring him back.
[30:20.57]Yeah, so I gotta go here and then go on the other one.
[30:38.77]What if that just kills him?
[30:41.49]Alright, he's back to life.
[30:42.23]Okay, so I got it.
[30:43.41]I gotta go.
[30:45.75]There's another machine in here that I have to turn off.
[30:48.77]Right?
[30:49.11]Oh, not in there.
[30:50.61]It's around the other side.
[30:51.45]There's too many people I can see through.
[30:57.87]Wait for this guy to move.
[31:00.24]Let's take a look at what the other one does.
[31:02.52]We can turn them both off.
[31:05.35]Really wish this guy would kind of get the hell out of the way.
[31:07.47]That'd be nice.
[31:07.91]Want any coins?
[31:08.61]No.
[31:09.51]I don't.
[31:11.07]Um... I really wish he would get out of here, man.
[31:20.95]Move.
[31:21.15]I don't have to walk all the way around.
[31:27.14]There we go.
[31:33.06]Two doctors.
[31:45.87]Can I do anything actually in here?
[31:52.88]I wonder if I can just, like, operate on him.
[31:56.78]Like, pull his heart out.
[31:59.13]Oh, here we go.
[32:00.05]Something I could do.
[32:00.67]No.
[32:01.55]Drain his stem cell pump.
[32:04.35]Okay.
[32:07.81]What are these guys doing in here?
[32:10.26]Huh?
[32:10.44]Hey, shitbag.
[32:38.08]You cannot operate to... Okay, so I need to, like, go in here and... Oh, look at this!
[32:43.62]That's crazy.
[32:45.08]Patient is recovering.
[32:47.56]Whoa!
[32:47.86]What are you playing at?
[32:48.90]Look, man, you're not getting away with this, all right?
[32:51.57]What the fuck is this guy talking about?
[32:52.95]He called the chief surgeon a shitbag.
[32:55.97]A shitbag.
[32:58.59]Hey, man, there's an imposter running around.
[33:01.25]Do we have a description?
[33:02.93]He was disguised as a surgeon.
[33:05.07]Stay here, Justin Kix.
[33:06.99]Leave it to me.
[33:09.93]Alright, I get it.
[33:14.19]I gotta get in here and be the surgeon.
[33:16.07]That's cool.
[33:18.43]You shitbag.
[33:20.26]Honestly, you shooting him is the best option.
[33:22.98]I just want to see what else I can do.
[33:24.10]I want to operate on him.
[33:29.89]That sounds like the most fun.
[33:30.75]So we're going to try that.
[33:31.97]But it's going to be hard to sneak between these idiots.
[33:36.46]Is there somebody... There's the person right there.
[33:39.94]Okay, let's get right next here.
[33:43.48]And this guy has his back turned.
[33:46.84]Easy peasy.
[33:47.98]Alright, let's go ahead and save the game in here.
[33:53.24]Let's dig our hands in this guy.
[33:56.65]Operate.
[33:59.00]Select procedure.
[34:02.34]Extract blood.
[34:03.82]Inject cardiac syringe.
[34:06.08]Activate robotic arm.
[34:10.51]Oh, God.
[34:11.09]Okay, that's right... That's right over his head.
[34:17.69]Let's see.
[34:20.61]Inject the syringe into his chest.
[34:24.69]It drained all his blood!
[34:35.00]Oh my god.
[34:37.56]That was... That was fucking terrible.
[34:44.93]Holy shit, that was brutal.
[34:50.93]Human error was the cause of death.
[34:55.23]Okay, that was... Yeah, you have to open the door right when I come in.
[34:57.65]Get the fuck out of the way, please.
[34:58.71]I need to get out of here.
[34:59.41]Get out of the way.
[35:03.84]Good.
[35:04.46]Okay, that was awesome.
[35:10.01]Alright, we're up.
[35:10.87]Where's the other one?
[35:14.77]There's other people that are gonna wake up real soon.
[35:18.39]Wait, what is this?
[35:19.99]What is this guy doing?
[35:20.83]Is that a person standing up?
[35:24.09]Hold on a second.
[35:27.62]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[35:31.10]Is that guy sleeping in here?
[35:37.32]no oh he is standing up I thought the guy was back in here asleep all right we're gonna go this way let's do an opportunity he's in the closet by the way he was sitting it looked like it was the guy sleeping all right um kai opportunities
[36:00.48]Hot Springs.
[36:02.70]Malpractice.
[36:03.42]Kind of already did that.
[36:04.14]That was fun.
[36:05.38]Thrill Seeker.
[36:07.46]Let's do Thrill Seeker.
[36:08.26]I feel like this is going to eat really hot sushi.
[36:15.73]I thought it was going to jam right into his forehead.
[36:17.11]I need to change disguises, though.
[36:19.95]Oh, hey, look.
[36:20.35]A disguise.
[36:24.31]Thanks, game.
[36:25.71]Thanks for listening to my prayers.
[36:30.77]I need a weapon of some sort.
[36:35.11]Alright, I'm back in the restaurant.
[36:51.88]Ah, fugu fish.
[36:52.56]This is where I'm gonna poison a guy with the fugu fish.
[36:55.20]Gonna have to be his chef now.
[36:56.61]After murdering patient chief, surgeon needs to check his kill room.
[36:59.43]Throw it out, I guess?
[37:00.41]It's a damn shame, too.
[37:19.84]the chef had to refuse serving Yuki Yamazaki his signature dish.
[37:24.12]I mean, despite her constant requests.
[37:27.10]How's the food?
[37:27.86]Is the food good?
[37:32.33]Good.
[37:33.09]I'm glad.
[37:33.53]Go back to your dinner.
[37:34.55]Thank you for participating.
[37:36.87]Throw it out, I guess.
[37:38.21]Okay, so... Intel, track it.
[37:43.62]It's a damn shame.
[37:44.52]Oh fuck, I have to listen to this again.
[37:45.80]The chef refused serving Yuki Yamazaki his signature dish.
[37:49.75]I mean, despite her constant requests.
[37:53.33]She asked about it just an hour ago.
[37:54.69]It's really too bad.
[37:55.55]Well, it's not worth losing your job over, that's for sure.
[37:59.42]Goma has banned the serving of fugu.
[38:01.58]Pufferfish.
[38:02.06]Yeah, that's... If you serve it wrong, you die, right?
[38:04.10]Mmm.
[38:04.30]Alright.
[38:04.86]Let's go get the fugu fish.
[38:26.89]Who's this handyman that's creeping around our kitchen?
[38:29.89]Is he spitting in the food?
[38:30.65]Where's the fugu fish?
[38:55.43]I need to disguise as a chef or something.
[38:57.79]These guys aren't gonna find me every time.
[39:06.38]Fugu, fugu, fugu, fugu, fugu fish, fugu fish.
[39:09.74]Fugu fish.
[39:11.40]Where is it?
[39:11.96]Knife.
[39:13.62]Perfect.
[39:15.40]Fugu fish.
[39:17.30]Freezer?
[39:24.78]Fugu.
[39:26.08]Where is it?
[39:27.94]There it is.
[39:32.54]Okay.
[39:33.76]Cooking.
[39:35.17]Get a chef disguise.
[39:37.71]That sounds easy enough to me.
[39:43.27]Alright.
[39:43.57]Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
[39:45.45]Which one of these chefs is getting a knife thrown at their head?
[39:50.60]Um...
[39:52.11]We're going to do this clean.
[39:53.87]No, we're not going to do it.
[39:54.55]No, we're not.
[39:54.97]No, no, no, no, no.
[39:56.93]Put the knife away.
[39:57.45]Put the knife away.
[39:58.21]No, no killing.
[39:59.29]Do not kill.
[40:08.36]We're not killing.
[40:10.30]We're going to maim, possibly seriously injure, but we're not going to kill.
[40:14.76]Ahem.
[40:21.20]One of these guys has to die.
[40:22.36]That's the sad truth.
[40:23.72]Maybe not.
[40:24.50]Where's he going?
[40:24.96]Is he going to be distracted by the fucking microwave oven?
[40:32.42]Perfect, perfect, perfect.
[40:33.96]Hey, it's me.
[40:36.30]Do you remember this?
[40:41.45]Do it.
[40:41.73]Put poison in it.
[40:42.23]Who cares?
[40:43.83]I don't even know who this is for.
[40:45.03]Remember me?
[40:48.47]I'm the guy that's working with you.
[40:52.74]You can't be trusted!
[41:01.36]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[41:04.99]I gotta put the fish in there now.
[41:09.65]I just had poison, didn't I?
[41:19.35]God damn it.
[41:21.29]Okay.
[41:22.53]I just poisoned some random guy's meal.
[41:26.65]Ah.
[41:26.77]Hey, remember nobody dies.
[41:33.83]Just kidding.
[41:41.66]Poison the sushi.
[41:43.40]What?
[41:48.93]Where's the... Oh, it's up there.
[41:51.31]What's the point of me having the poison then?
[41:54.35]Where's the knife?
[41:59.19]I gotta stuff these guys in the freezer.
[42:01.77]With me, with me, with me.
[42:02.57]Alright, stuff him in here.
[42:10.52]I think that guy might freeze to death in here.
[42:16.58]So that's two deaths.
[42:19.82]No killing and then you poison a guy's soup.
[42:21.56]I just wanted to get it over with.
[42:22.50]I didn't want to sneak around.
[42:23.40]Oh, he can go right here.
[42:28.50]That's pretty good logic.
[42:29.32]Put the dead guy in the freezer.
[42:31.22]Put the dead guy in here where he's dead and it's not going to be a problem.
[42:34.21]Put the other guy in the freezer where he's guaranteed to die.
[42:36.15]Because he's going to freeze to death.
[42:37.15]That's great.
[42:37.67]Okay.
[42:38.33]Poison the sushi.
[42:40.75]You got it.
[42:46.41]I'm going to go upstairs.
[42:48.27]This way?
[42:50.21]Yes.
[42:54.74]All right.
[42:55.48]Hello.
[42:56.66]Love those entrees.
[42:58.68]You're very welcome.
[43:05.04]Let's prepare some sushi.
[43:07.52]See, I'm going to pretend I belong here.
[43:11.05]Let's see how he does it.
[43:12.25]Okay, he grabs a little piece of bacon.
[43:15.03]Grabs some flour.
[43:18.09]Prepares it.
[43:18.61]There it is.
[43:21.67]Does anybody come and eat this?
[43:26.00]Or do I just make one?
[43:27.26]Oh, here we go.
[43:27.78]Here comes a guy.
[43:28.28]That looks delicious!
[43:31.78]Oh, what?
[43:32.48]If I poison the sushi and I make it, someone's gonna die.
[43:35.55]Yeah, eat it.
[43:41.43]How would I know how to do this?
[43:45.36]This is all so standard.
[43:47.44]Eat it.
[43:48.04]Um, excuse me.
[43:49.19]Ooh, ooh, make another one quick.
[43:50.59]Never trust a skinny chef.
[43:52.55]Get out of the way, dude.
[43:53.49]I gotta make a new one.
[43:54.11]What?
[43:54.33]Oh, shit, I must go and get the, um, uh, from the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[44:10.87]The rules are the rules.
[44:12.59]I'm sure you understand.
[44:15.13]I'm a lawyer.
[44:16.35]I see them more as a set of guidelines.
[44:18.41]Excuse me.
[44:19.53]Delicate sushi?
[44:20.45]Can we save it right now?
[44:22.62]Take a look at that.
[44:24.70]Is this Fugu?
[44:26.34]Ooh, Fugu.
[44:27.58]I knew you would come around eventually.
[44:30.02]Good for you.
[44:31.16]I hope you like it.
[44:32.30]My colleague is a straight girl.
[44:34.31]Me, I say it's good to live dangerously.
[44:37.17]You took the words right out of my mouth.
[44:41.03]Yes, that's exactly right.
[44:44.91]Smooth, velvet softness.
[44:48.54]Absolutely delicious.
[44:51.60]My compliments to the chef.
[44:53.32]You're welcome.
[44:53.70]I have to share something.
[44:58.43]What happened to that lady?
[45:01.61]Hey, you okay?
[45:02.11]Let's make some more sushi.
[45:03.89]Just in case we're not prepared for the inevitable death.

[46:08.48]It's fresh.
[46:09.30]Oh, it's not poisoned.
[46:10.18]Never mind.
[46:11.80]Alright, let's go.
[46:12.50]I did it!
[46:22.44]God damn it.
[46:23.02]I so badly... I have never used a cleaver before in the game.
[46:26.30]Fugu contains lethal amounts of the poison Tetra... Tetra-dox... Tetra-doxin.
[46:32.84]The poison, a sodium channel blocker, paralyzes the muscle.
[46:36.70]Oh.
[46:38.36]Well, I got one more opportunity to look at the death room.
[46:42.04]Everyone's still unconscious.
[46:45.36]You guys did well.
[46:46.55]Nice work.
[46:48.31]Pack of cigarettes.
[46:50.81]Okay, well that was a challenge.
[46:52.15]Complete.
[46:56.73]And that's it.
[46:57.89]I did it.
[46:58.19]To beat the mission.
[47:00.76]I did pretty well on that one.
[47:02.44]Alright, how many points?
[47:17.73]I only killed two people.
[47:19.01]One of them was on accident and the other one just kind of got in the way and I had to reload and I didn't... Is that me?
[47:26.95]That's not what my ticket says.
[47:36.42]Is that Diane?
[47:36.88]We received your message.
[47:38.78]Loud and clear, I might add.
[47:41.16]Honestly, you could have just sacked the poor guy.
[47:49.27]I didn't catch your name.
[47:50.41]No, you didn't.
[47:52.49]You didn't.
[47:55.13]There'll be no retaliation.
[47:56.69]She's going to get assassinated right now.
[48:02.39]Someone's been meddling in our affairs.
[48:04.47]She's going to get a syringe in the neck.
[48:06.23]Killing our operatives and making the ICA look like fools.
[48:12.43]I think you got close to that someone.
[48:15.91]Can't wait for season two when it's revealed.
[48:17.41]Closer than we've ever been.
[48:19.78]That's why we're having you to take him down.
[48:24.53]I don't think so.
[48:27.87]Don't rattle our cages, Miss Burnwood.
[48:30.87]You really have no idea.
[48:33.01]You spy on us, bribe our people, and you have the gall to demand our help.
[48:44.21]Oh, no, even so boom we've been around for a long long 47 is on a parachute.
[48:50.31]I think we could help each other the detonator in his hand huge reveal Poison don't touch it.
[48:59.87]It's got poison all it's got poison residue on some 20 years ago your agency took in a young man with no past and extraordinary skills
[49:13.10]In his own special way, he cares about you.
[49:17.02]And vice versa.
[49:18.56]And ever since that time, you've never stopped wondering where he came from and who made him what he is.
[49:28.43]There was a doctor.
[49:29.97]Some depraved experiment.
[49:33.27]But he's gone now.
[49:36.97]Well, if you believe the questions died with him.
[49:40.90]We have nothing further to discuss.
[49:44.56]If not, as I said, I think we could help each other.
[49:49.93]Poison breath.
[49:51.05]Poison breath.
[49:51.69]Okay, I'm shutting up.
[49:55.95]This isn't a thing you do with your mouth, right?
[50:01.37]Cheer up, Miss Burnwood.
[50:03.77]We?
[50:06.61]We are the lesser evil.
[50:08.45]This terrorist.
[50:11.15]Rock music comes in.
[50:11.87]I have no idea who that guy was.
[50:16.43]I've skipped everything.
[50:19.39]Don't drink that tea.
[50:41.07]He dropped a fucking fugu in that tea.
[50:42.89]Don't drink the tea.
[50:44.27]It's me as a baby.
[50:53.20]The same expression.
[51:00.62]Just with that, like, I'm 47 expression.
[51:05.23]Hey, I did it.
[51:10.27]In loving memory of Peter Eyed Paulson.
[51:14.15]Well, rest in peace, my friend.
[51:15.90]The game was good.
[51:21.90]This was fun.
[51:24.62]And I'm not even done.
[51:32.26]How many points did I get?
[51:32.86]What do you think?
[51:36.12]That's the end of the game, though.
[51:37.02]That's the end of Season 1.
[51:40.52]technically the end of the quote game like straight up campaign missions but there's other things to do which I want to just check out a couple of them before I get out of here yeah 15,000 points god it's such a huge penalty if somebody dies unnecessarily no recordings no bodies found no noticed kills never spotted fuck man
[52:11.81]Seasons, seasons, seasons, seasons.
[52:15.25]Season one just ended.
[52:16.88]That last mission came out like two weeks ago.
[52:19.28]Not even.
[52:20.40]That last mission, the one we just played, came out like nine days ago or ten days ago.
[52:27.57]Fugu poison is 1,200 times stronger than cyanide.
[52:30.23]Oh my god.
[52:32.88]All right, let's take a look at some of this stuff because those are just the campaign missions, right?
[52:36.04]There's all kinds of other things to do.
[52:38.66]Let me see.
[52:40.32]Discovery feeds targets.
[52:42.28]Debriefing.
[52:42.88]Let's go back to the main menu.
[52:47.55]You're an assassin, not a shock trooper.
[52:53.59]So does the game suck?
[52:54.89]No.
[52:57.41]I think there's probably enough content to justify buying it.
[53:01.67]Judging by each mission can be done, like, dozens of different ways.
[53:06.29]And they all have these, like, you know, these, like, naked guys.
[53:09.43]You know, every mission has at least one naked guy.
[53:12.83]Um... Let's try to do one of the things.
[53:18.06]Let's do one of these things.
[53:20.94]Okay, apparently this is a target mission.
[53:24.24]Gotta eliminate this guy with any disguise.
[53:27.56]In the Consulate Plaza.
[53:31.47]Did I even like play this mission?
[53:36.99]Let's just see what it does.
[53:37.97]I have no idea what this is.
[53:40.47]Apparently this is like a just eliminate one guy mission.
[53:44.55]Yeah.
[53:47.21]Yeah, I was just doing the campaign.
[53:49.37]Just the straight up mission one through six.
[53:55.24]This is one of the other.
[53:56.12]Okay.
[53:59.60]Interesting.
[54:01.90]Eliminate Zaki Diab.
[54:07.42]In pretty much any creative way you can, I guess.
[54:10.43]Where is he?
[54:10.89]Down there?
[54:16.85]So many people here.
[54:18.31]My graphics card's gonna crash again.
[54:20.03]So what is this guy doing?
[54:25.42]Is he just, like, standing over here?
[54:27.97]Oh, he's a fortune teller.
[54:29.03]This guy's a fortune teller, right?
[54:30.49]Okay.
[54:37.15]What's this?
[54:38.75]Dried bananas?
[54:41.01]What do I have for items?
[54:43.88]Coins.
[54:44.38]Okay, I have like the pretty standard hitman fare.
[54:47.70]Spawn a deathclaw.
[54:53.98]This is so cool.
[54:54.76]Okay, can I go in here?
[54:55.58]What is he going to do if I walk in here?
[55:00.22]That guy wants to kill this guy.
[55:02.12]Can you make up your own scenario and voice act it?
[55:06.58]I swear to god that guy was not an actual voice actor.
[55:10.58]That was some random guy that was just talking.
[55:29.98]I see you naked.
[55:31.96]You are you.
[55:34.46]You have to leave.
[55:36.28]Huh?
[55:36.88]This is no place for you.
[55:39.74]Death is not welcome here.
[55:42.27]Oh, go before I call for help.
[55:45.43]You are evil.
[55:48.05]Evil, I say!
[55:49.43]Evil!
[55:49.77]What the hell is going on?
[55:51.53]I want to know my fortune.
[55:54.61]Hey!
[55:55.39]Hey, this area's off limits.
[55:58.84]Nice.
[55:59.22]He went to his, like, default voice.
[56:04.48]Okay.
[56:09.82]Okay, let's, like, try it.
[56:15.19]Evil.
[56:16.51]Evil.
[56:17.49]Hey, this place is off limits, buddy.
[56:25.63]Oh, yes, I've seen evil in you all.
[56:28.55]Hey, yo, buddy, this place is off limits.
[56:30.07]Scram.
[56:35.19]Okay, I'll tell you right now, if this... If you can make your own custom scenarios and voice act them and, like, add shit to them, then this could be the best game ever made.
[56:44.82]If that's a reality, I'm gonna make one.
[56:47.82]I'm gonna make it insane if that's true.
[56:53.08]Alright, so let me get a different costume on then.
[56:57.58]Why won't that flickering stop?
[57:00.84]It's making me all disoriented.
[57:02.32]Alright, well he's obviously telling me to turn off the lights.
[57:08.45]You just cheated.
[57:09.49]He just gave me the exact thing to do.
[57:12.01]I can't save this?
[57:14.01]You just gotta do it in one go, huh?
[57:16.96]Okay.
[57:24.94]As soon as he comes out.
[57:29.48]He's not actually going to come over here to investigate.
[57:31.64]Huh?
[57:37.67]Whoa.
[57:39.43]You should have came back here.
[57:40.27]That was your own fault.
[57:41.37]What were you doing back here?
[57:42.33]I'm not sure.
[57:45.26]Whoa.
[57:46.79]That was all her fault.
[57:48.30]What the fuck is he talking about?
[57:49.64]Alright, well we're going this way.
[58:05.77]There's dead bodies everywhere.
[58:08.79]Oh my god.
[58:09.53]I can't take this So my sister met this customer really stood out.
[58:15.08]Hey, why can't I date your sister?
[58:16.86]She's gorgeous because it's my sister You can't date his sister buddy shut up about it
[58:35.60]So it's just these little micro-missions.
[58:38.38]That was so easy, though.
[58:39.32]The guard was just like, Oh boy, I really wish those lights would stop flickering.
[58:44.15]Oh, maybe if I turned off the fuse box.
[58:46.45]The fuse box right to the left behind where he's doing a fortune teller.
[58:49.97]He's the fortune teller.
[58:50.91]Disable the fuse box.
[58:52.41]If only I could do that.
[58:53.58]That was kind of a little... 68,000 points, ladies and gentlemen.
[58:59.28]68k.
[59:05.94]Highest point you've ever seen in your life.
[59:11.12]Play next level.
[59:13.60]I guess they're all just kind of... Oh, here's another one.
[59:18.82]Okay, so this time... I have to be the fortune teller... And kill the guy that comes in to get his fortune.
[59:28.47]So they just get progressively more complicated?
[59:34.90]Alright, let's give it a try.
[59:37.18]Planning.
[59:38.12]I can actually take things now.
[59:43.86]Taking the explosives.
[59:45.54]We're going to make this interesting.
[59:48.27]And a fucking giant knife.
[59:50.89]And I'm going to be dressed as Summer Man.

[61:46.84]You can't save these missions though, so you gotta do them one and done.
[61:49.80]And no more, no less, blend in.
[61:54.46]Where's the other guy?
[61:55.66]Right there.
[61:57.41]So... Very easily enough, I have to...
[62:15.22]I need to turn the lights off.
[62:17.64]Hide here for a second.
[62:19.58]Wait till he actually gets in there.
[62:21.41]And then choke him out.
[62:23.89]Yeah, you should.
[62:25.07]Get the hell out of my way.
[62:27.75]There she goes again.
[62:28.83]There she goes again, fucking it up again.

[62:34.78]Why are you here?
[62:37.00]Oh my god, get out of here.
[62:39.14]This would be so easy if you just take your selfie in the corner, but with like a bunch of carpets.
[62:43.72]Okay, cool.
[62:45.20]You did great.
[62:46.72]There you go.
[62:48.06]Okay, take his disguise and then dump him.
[62:55.21]Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly.
[62:59.37]Unconscious, what?
[63:01.77]Oh, I have to kill this guy.
[63:03.25]Okay, easy.
[63:03.75]Done.
[63:08.33]What?
[63:10.93]What?
[63:11.11]They heard me break his neck?
[63:13.95]They heard me break his neck.
[63:15.13]You all right, man?
[63:15.79]Please don't.
[63:16.47]Man, I ain't shitting you.
[63:17.71]It's not funny, okay?
[63:18.41]I just saw this guy.
[63:19.51]He's an evil-looking guy.
[63:21.38]And he was trying to get rid of what looked like a body.
[63:25.14]No way.
[63:25.84]I'm not kidding you.
[63:26.54]Do we have any ID on the suspect?
[63:28.72]He looked mean.
[63:29.98]I mean, big and bald.
[63:31.52]And he had a real contrast.
[63:33.42]Stop that.
[63:33.88]Do you hear me?
[63:34.40]I don't know.
[63:35.69]Something out of Arabian Nights?
[63:38.45]What the fuck?
[63:41.21]I broke that guy's neck so loudly.
[63:43.24]Oh, great.
[63:54.68]Okay, yeah.
[63:57.59]Oh my god, I saw this guy over there.
[63:59.67]He's a scary guy.
[64:01.11]Put that body down.
[64:02.81]Oh, yeah.
[64:14.39]Use the fog machine.
[64:15.07]Alright, I'm gonna be fine.
[64:20.72]I'm not holding a body.
[64:41.35]Yeah, you can see me through the carpet.
[64:44.57]That's great.
[64:46.51]You can see me through the drape.
[64:54.35]I can't see.
[64:54.91]What the fuck was that?
[65:01.46]I knocked that guy.
[65:02.96]Now he's just shooting?
[65:05.36]He got punked so hard that now he's just unloading into the room.
[65:16.97]Oh man, I gotta look like I gotta back up and look like I was really shooting at this guy My god dude fucking hold it Okay That guy was so embarrassed that he had to pretend to his colleagues that something really bad was going on
[65:47.79]Alright, this time... So how am I supposed to drag his... put his body in there?
[65:53.56]That's the only place I can feasibly get rid of him.
[66:00.22]If you think about it, right?
[66:01.02]I gotta obviously pull that, he walks over there, knock him out and dump him.
[66:06.97]But if somebody saw me do that... I was right, I was behind the whole wall.
[66:13.13]I'm going to wait for this lady.
[66:16.18]She comes over here and takes a selfie and then she leaves.
[66:18.00]I'm going to wait for selfie lady.
[66:25.24]Just leave him and run?
[66:26.28]I got to go in here and pretend to be the fortune teller for this guy.
[66:31.18]That next guy has to die.
[66:34.70]Come on.
[66:35.16]Come over here lady.
[66:35.78]Is she not going to come over here now?
[66:40.76]Apparently not.
[66:42.32]Oh, here she comes.
[66:45.44]Go on.
[66:49.08]Yeah.
[66:50.94]Do the thing where you come over here and take a picture.
[66:55.27]Is this the good spot?
[66:57.45]Hmm.
[67:00.71]Can't wait to put this on Instagram.
[67:05.49]Don't look at me.
[67:07.53]Creep.
[67:09.13]Get out of here.
[67:14.60]Alright, come investigate.
[67:15.50]This guy... It takes him actually a pretty long time to do this, so... There he is.
[67:30.73]He's doing it.
[67:31.33]Okay, it looks like this is... Where the hell is the caretaker?
[67:36.95]I mean, he should be doing this.
[67:38.11]Okay, do it now.
[67:46.65]You did not hear that.
[67:47.77]There's no fucking way you heard me snap his neck.
[67:51.36]Just, dude, pretend it was like a bag of potato chips.
[67:53.54]Like, how would you know it's a neck snapping?
[67:57.46]Give me a break.
[68:02.24]Oh, I'm back.
[68:02.74]There we go.
[68:04.50]Let me take another snap here.
[68:09.43]I'm gonna get, like, 200 likes on Instagram.
[68:11.75]I guarantee it.
[68:14.29]I can't even take it.
[68:15.07]There's another guy looking at me.
[68:21.69]Oh, there you are.
[68:22.79]Hey, I need to know some more about what you're talking about.
[68:26.68]I need to know more.
[68:28.04]I need to get more answers.
[68:30.52]Oh, yes, I will give you the secret.
[68:32.30]Should I leave my wife?
[68:35.08]Because I feel like the spirits are telling me to leave my wife.
[68:41.49]Because it just feels right to do it.
[68:45.71]I feel you should leave your wife, too.
[68:48.69]Leave this plane of existence!
[68:59.28]I can't believe it.
[68:59.86]This is insane.
[69:00.36]Who killed him?
[69:00.76]It's unbelievable to me.
[69:01.70]Please have a seat.
[69:02.63]You look like the cat that ate the canary.
[69:05.15]What's up, man?
[69:05.55]Talk to me.
[69:26.32]What the hell is he talking about?
[69:45.49]You look like the cat that ate the canary.
[69:49.49]Okay, when is this guy going to come in?
[69:51.99]Oh, come on.
[69:52.79]Oh, I can hide in the closet.
[69:54.95]I can hide in the closet.
[69:57.63]I can hide here.
[69:58.70]We're safe.
[70:06.96]Is he getting up?
[70:11.28]Why does it look like he was getting up there?
[70:14.35]This guy is shaking all over the place.
[70:25.11]He's in a fortune teller costume.
[70:29.86]Oh, come on.
[70:32.88]Nobody saw me.
[70:33.90]Nobody saw me come in here.
[70:37.40]That would have been so annoying if he would have opened this.
[70:46.73]Okay.
[70:47.69]Any second now I'll be able to sit back down and
[70:51.08]Continue my fortune telling ways Yeah, fuck I forgot the guy that I'm supposed to kill is gonna come in here.
[71:01.24]What is this guy doing?
[71:03.54]He's he robbing him?
[71:08.42]What is he doing?
[71:11.79]What are all these people doing in here?
[71:13.35]That guy just like grabbed his wallet and ran
[71:24.77]Oh boy, this sure is fucking crazy.
[71:29.92]What are we going to do about this?
[71:33.38]It's insane.
[71:34.19]I'm just not sure.
[71:36.83]I'm going to stoically pose.
[71:41.21]Until I kind of want to come out and just karate chop her in the neck.
[71:49.40]Okay, here's the problem.
[71:50.90]These idiots keep coming in here and noticing this dead body so I can never leave.
[72:01.07]Get out of here.
[72:05.29]There's so many people in this room now.
[72:10.30]Get out.
[72:11.66]Get out.
[72:13.18]This guy was already in here.
[72:15.36]Oh, God.
[72:19.61]Throw a mine out there.
[72:21.11]No, I can't.
[72:23.73]I can't.
[72:25.19]I want to.
[72:25.59]Oh, my God.
[72:26.05]They keep... It's a cycle.
[72:27.43]They keep cycling because one of them will run away and they'll... No, get out of here.
[72:50.98]Some other idiot pedestrian walks in here and goes, oh my god, police!
[73:07.87]Get the fuck out of here.
[73:09.76]Will you turn the fuck around, please?
[73:17.02]Please, come on.
[73:18.68]Compromised.
[73:19.36]Oh, I'm compromised.
[73:20.18]Because here comes another random lady.
[73:22.56]It's going to run in here and just be like... Okay.
[73:29.50]We're down to compromise.
[73:30.58]No, here he comes again.
[73:32.92]Did I check here already?
[73:34.79]I completely forgot.
[73:35.67]Did I see these guys yet?
[73:37.83]Oh, no.
[73:39.29]Oh, wait.
[73:39.65]No, he's dead.
[73:40.29]I'm just getting rid of him.
[73:41.43]That guy's dead.
[73:46.48]Took you that long to figure that out.
[73:50.78]Sayonara.
[73:54.81]Sayonara.
[73:55.39]This has been so long.
[73:58.59]I want to get out of here.
[73:59.59]How long have I been in this closet for?
[74:02.35]It's been at least four minutes.
[74:05.63]He's dumping the body in the trash can right now.
[74:16.20]What?
[74:17.84]I'm coming out.
[74:26.87]Are we good?
[74:35.43]Hello?
[74:37.35]How am I still compromised?
[74:47.43]I think the mission's broken.
[74:51.36]Don't come in here.
[74:57.72]Here he comes.
[74:59.92]Who's gonna get it?
[75:00.50]No, shit.
[75:01.26]Here comes like a stupid fucking police officer.
[75:03.45]Don't even think about looking in here.
[75:07.17]Uh...
[75:15.14]Alright, this is getting a little ridiculous.
[75:16.50]Do I have to reload this mission?
[75:17.70]Because the game will not let me stay out.
[75:19.76]I've just been perma-compromised.
[75:22.14]Here he comes.
[75:22.46]I actually have to go get the guy?
[75:32.67]I have to go get the... Hold on.
[75:38.86]Someone is coming in.
[75:42.00]What are you doing?
[75:42.90]You creep.
[75:45.39]Get in here.
[75:45.81]Get in here.
[75:46.36]Yes, please sit.
[75:47.68]Let the great Gandalfini tell you.
[76:14.40]Thanks for coming.
[76:15.60]Enjoy your stay.
[76:20.12]Documents.
[76:30.41]I love how that guy just hovered in.
[76:36.39]How do I get this guy to get in here?
[76:37.99]Do I have to go fetch this guy?
[76:40.81]Your appointment is ready, sir.
[76:44.30]Alright, I'm gonna go get him.
[76:47.34]So should I just go kill him in the costume?
[76:50.70]Technically you don't even need to read the guy's fortune, right?
[76:52.54]I can just murder him in broad daylight and run.
[77:04.87]Just gotta be in the costume.
[77:07.34]Never said he had to get his fortune read, just has to be in the fucking costume.
[77:18.10]Door's locked.
[77:18.54]I can't get in there.
[77:19.74]Where is he?
[77:20.02]Open the door.
[77:48.29]Open the door!
[77:48.91]Oh my god.
[77:59.87]Okay, I can go in that way.
[78:04.33]Alright, this time... How do they know you're bald under your hat?
[78:18.78]Alright, this time, I'm not gonna kill that guy.
[78:22.58]I'm not gonna break this guy's neck either.
[78:28.37]I didn't know I had to go get him.
[78:31.11]I thought he was just gonna come sit down.
[78:36.27]Wait, why are you guys fail fishing?
[78:37.89]That was a fail from the very beginning.
[78:43.06]That was a fail like 18 minutes ago.
[78:47.48]Why won't that flicker and stop?
[78:49.84]Oh, pardon me.
[78:51.12]I didn't see you there, sir.
[78:56.03]Yeah, come investigate the area.
[78:57.33]Oh, no.
[78:57.65]Somebody broke my lights.
[78:58.87]I better go over there and take a look.
[79:01.29]What happened?
[79:05.77]My lights turned off.
[79:07.07]Oh, I better go and investigate.
[79:18.11]Alright, don't... Don't, uh... Don't snap his neck yet.
[79:23.34]I have to kill him.
[79:23.90]I'm gonna do it quiet.
[79:26.52]Quietly.
[79:31.13]Oh, my fucking... God damn it, dude.
[79:33.43]Like, for real.
[79:34.31]Wait, why am I a pervert?
[79:36.81]What makes me a pervert?
[79:47.28]I don't understand.
[79:48.32]Oh, my God, we got so many things here.
[79:50.93]We got so many bricks and shit.
[79:53.23]For the love of fucking God.
[79:59.83]Hey, you!
[80:01.85]What the hell's going on?
[80:02.91]Line of sight to target.
[80:03.93]Fan out.
[80:04.53]Let's get him.
[80:05.29]Shooters around here.
[80:06.49]Fan out.
[80:07.41]Watch your six.
[80:09.65]Goddamn.
[80:14.73]All this because apparently somebody saw him that time.
[80:18.06]That's such dog shit.
[80:21.60]And you all know it.
[80:24.16]I did the same exact thing I did last time, and somebody was like, Wait, I can see a toe!
[80:27.84]I can see somebody's toe!
[80:31.70]Start it over.
[80:35.11]Did the exact same thing I did last time.
[80:37.51]No, I think I see a shoe over there!
[80:39.13]Call the police!
[80:42.53]Oh, and he's a pervert, too!
[80:46.16]Yeah, break.
[80:46.78]That was dumb.
[80:58.13]It was the selfie girl?
[80:58.95]She wasn't even coming over.
[80:59.87]Why do I have to wait for a selfie girl before I can do this?
[81:10.43]See, that's stupid.
[81:11.17]I'm dumb that I have to wait for this person.
[81:15.41]To walk over here and take a selfie and then leave.
[81:19.87]Okay, let's just wait.
[81:22.79]Let's wait for the selfie girl.
[81:24.41]Oh no, we gotta go over here first.
[81:26.97]Look at this.
[81:27.49]Then I put my hands together and my gloves.
[81:35.10]Go on.
[81:35.80]Go ahead.
[81:36.94]Go over there.
[81:39.38]Go do the two things that your AI is programmed to do.
[81:52.57]Do it.
[81:53.77]Take your phone up.
[81:55.53]Take a picture.
[81:58.23]No, she's not going to take a picture.
[82:00.97]She came all the way over here to send a text.
[82:03.97]She does this thing where she goes to take a picture and then she doesn't do it.
[82:08.22]It's like she's self-conscious when she gets the camera up.
[82:12.30]One of these days I'll take it.
[82:13.42]One of these days I'll take a picture of my face.
[82:16.86]Break Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah go on out there She wants to be blurry Okay, there's a person here
[82:43.31]Watch out for the one person.
[82:45.51]He knew he only had five seconds to decide which wire to cut before the atomic warhead exploded.
[83:02.21]No, no, no, no!
[83:04.25]Selfie, bitch!
[83:05.31]Hey, naked person, are you alright?
[83:20.57]I'll take over now God damn it.
[83:23.95]Why did you come over here?
[83:27.23]Damn it.
[83:28.15]It's not fair I waited
[83:48.26]I waited.
[83:48.96]I waited.
[83:50.58]And everything.
[83:51.86]And you know I did that correctly.
[83:53.88]And she came in again to take a picture.
[83:58.11]You want your fortune read?
[83:59.09]Sit down.
[84:02.21]God, this is so fucking dumb.
[84:03.97]That is so dumb.
[84:06.57]Fuck it.
[84:08.03]Hey, soldier.
[84:09.33]I don't think that's your uniform.
[84:11.74]Hello, I'm trying to report to you.
[84:16.37]Okay.
[84:17.09]No, no, no!
[84:19.85]Give me a break.
[84:21.59]That's so stupid.
[84:22.85]Oh, that's not me!
[84:25.80]That's not you!
[84:26.78]Hey, that's not you!
[84:27.52]I need you to get as far away as possible.
[84:30.98]Holy shit!
[84:31.60]Wait a minute.
[84:32.96]Is that him?
[84:33.74]No, that's not you!
[84:35.76]Who's that?
[84:37.05]He missed!
[84:41.97]Give me the machine gun and give me the disguise back.
[84:49.34]I'm killing this guy right now.
[84:51.82]He's dead.
[84:53.68]I don't care if I gotta go room by fucking room.
[84:56.08]I don't have a visual.
[84:58.61]I'm killing this guy in the fucking fortune teller costume.
[85:02.51]Even if I have a goddamn machine gun.
[85:04.11]Take him down.
[85:12.37]God, that's cold.
[85:18.27]We're doing this like Gears of War style.
[85:22.29]Blow!
[85:23.61]Oh shit!
[85:47.65]That wasn't even my fault you guys know that I like waited for her to get out of there And I did it and then she just came back a second later Fucking come on god darn it
[86:12.74]So what, she can come back within two seconds?
[86:15.18]Do I have to get rid of her too?
[86:25.31]I think I'm just gonna wait for her to leave the area.
[86:34.37]Kill him with the smoke?
[86:35.55]Yeah.
[86:36.39]Yeah, but if I walk in here, he's gonna be like, hey, how dare you?
[86:39.75]Alright, let's try that.
[86:40.93]Hey, how are you?
[86:50.54]Hey, Dimwit, you got a learning disability?
[86:53.10]I said stop.
[86:55.92]He just followed me in here.
[86:57.08]Enough is enough.
[87:00.88]Okay.
[87:01.10]Okay.
[87:05.92]You really think I'm that stupid?
[87:09.14]You're not getting away with this, all right?
[87:10.88]I'm getting help.
[87:11.76]What, did you see something?
[87:15.04]Clipped him!
[87:18.58]I told you he was going to see.
[87:21.52]Police!
[87:22.83]Police!
[87:23.33]What have you done?
[87:33.38]What?
[87:34.36]What?
[87:35.12]Oh, I'm gonna pass out.
[87:36.20]Hold on, calm down.
[87:38.87]Hold on, I'm gonna fucking pass out.
[87:40.03]I'm sorry.
[87:40.31]Okay.
[87:40.57]Thank god, that was the hardest to ever fucking stab somebody.
[87:45.19]What happened?
[87:56.16]I'm gonna fucking go.
[87:56.90]I'm going.
[87:57.50]The world's going black.
[88:04.11]Okay.
[88:04.77]I'm okay.
[88:12.07]Oh my god.
[88:12.81]I'm gonna pass out.
[88:15.05]I left way too fast.
[88:16.33]Too hard.
[88:23.63]Okay.
[88:36.16]Alright, so that didn't work.
[88:37.93]I'm gonna do it the way that I did it before, except this time, I'm gonna do it right.
[88:40.71]No more fucking around.
[88:42.53]No more fucking around.
[88:43.41]That knife clip.
[88:44.75]I didn't see that knife clip.
[88:46.75]We were standing there, just silent, looking at each other, and then... Like, it was fast forward.
[88:51.73]How hard I jammed that knife into his fucking face.
[88:55.60]It was inhuman how fast that was.
[89:02.65]I love this game.
[89:03.41]This game is so stupid, but I love it.
[89:05.71]Oh, come on.
[89:07.17]You can't turn that light off.
[89:08.61]Okay, I'm going to do it right.
[89:09.33]We're going to wait for her to come back here.
[89:10.70]We're going to wait for her to go out of here.
[89:13.16]No messing around.
[89:24.62]Let me just take a look.
[89:25.54]I want to see where he is.
[89:26.88]Actually, no, no, no, no, no.
[89:32.48]Silent knife him.
[89:33.88]No, I'm gonna shoot him in the face.
[89:37.09]Wait a minute.
[89:38.93]Hold on.
[89:39.45]Now, what if... What if I just put the proximity mine right here and just, like, leave?
[89:47.15]Just get the hell out of here.
[89:47.97]And then come back in, like, ten minutes.
[89:49.20]I'm gonna try that.
[89:55.78]We're gonna put the proximity mine here.
[89:57.26]I'm just gonna put it down.
[89:57.88]I'm gonna initiate this.
[90:00.87]And then leave.
[90:02.31]Right?
[90:14.50]Weird.
[90:15.96]What do you think that noise was?
[90:17.70]Yeah, alright.
[90:20.00]No, no, no, no!
[90:21.02]Don't go look!
[90:21.66]No!
[90:22.06]You fucking god damn it!
[90:25.20]Why would you... Echo Golf Niner 3.
[90:27.42]That was not fireworks.
[90:29.69]That was a freaking bomb.
[90:31.41]I got a key.
[90:31.96]Let me call the police.
[90:34.08]I gotta call the police!
[90:40.96]Get off the phone, dude!
[90:42.10]I need to pretend to be a person!
[90:43.45]Oh my god, get away from the phone!
[90:57.66]Why are you people looking at me like this?
[90:59.48]Who is him?
[91:00.90]Oh my fucking god.
[91:09.30]I just wanted to pretend to be a person on the phone.
[91:12.41]And everything got all fucked up.
[91:13.85]I'm never going to complete this.
[91:20.85]This is like so easy and I just can't, everything just keeps going wrong.
[91:23.97]What the, alright.
[91:35.83]He's standing there.
[91:36.51]No, it's because I bumped the guy on the phone and I was trying to blend in.
[91:44.06]Actually, I'm having fun right now.
[91:46.54]This is fun.
[91:49.60]rocked that guy.
[91:50.62]That guy's neck just bounced back and forth.
[91:57.54]That would have probably worked if it wasn't for the random idiot that just decided to go investigate.
[92:04.27]This guy.
[92:05.93]I heard a noise over here.
[92:06.81]I'm going to investigate.
[92:08.27]Let's try it again the real way.
[92:10.01]And the real way is...
[92:15.60]Subdue him.
[92:16.98]Silently just fucking stab him or something.
[92:19.86]Throw a knife in his head.
[92:20.68]I don't know.
[92:23.37]You know what?
[92:23.81]I'm not going to kill him back here because it always is wrong.
[92:26.73]I'm going to knock him out, take his disguise, get the guy to come in the room, come back and knife him and leave.
[92:37.74]Like, honest to God, forget about it, right?
[92:40.54]Here she comes.
[92:44.12]Stab the teller in the face, take his clothes, and rush to the other guy?
[92:46.88]I can't.
[92:48.88]Fiber wire?
[92:49.62]I don't have it.
[92:50.08]I need to, like, reload the mission and get it.
[92:54.73]I'm gonna try this.
[92:55.57]I'll get fiber wire if this doesn't work.
[92:58.27]Because I can subdue him silently and then just take his clothes.
[93:01.49]I'm gonna leave him here and knock... No, I'm gonna dump him.
[93:04.76]Eventually, I can... No, I can't.
[93:06.22]No.
[93:06.52]You know what?
[93:07.16]I'm gonna blow the fucking... I'm gonna blow this thing up.
[93:09.32]Come on.
[93:11.86]there she goes she's looking at something here get out this guy's gonna see me do this isn't he hey you yeah you
[93:40.09]You have one broken fuse box.
[93:42.79]Hey, excuse me.
[93:43.55]I'm talking to you.
[93:44.71]I gotta get the hell out of here now.
[93:48.83]You are not getting it.
[93:50.16]That's enough.
[93:51.20]Wait, who are you?
[93:52.50]Hey!
[93:52.78]Alright, somebody in chat told me to do that, and it didn't work.
[93:55.26]They just got everybody mad at me.
[93:58.46]Somebody in chat told me to do that.
[94:00.98]We've got you.
[94:02.02]On your knees.
[94:03.30]Keep those hands behind your head.
[94:05.19]Down on your knees.
[94:06.35]I said...
[94:13.57]Somebody told me to do that.
[94:15.37]I looked over and it said that was the way to do it.
[94:24.36]I saw a bunch of people in chat told me how to do that.
[94:26.46]That didn't work.
[94:32.51]I got five more.
[94:33.25]No, I'm good.
[94:34.01]Let's do it again.
[94:38.99]If the chat tells you to jump in a pit, would you do it?
[94:40.73]Yeah, I would.
[94:42.32]Because that did happen, actually.
[94:43.86]Stop listening to chat.
[94:46.02]Rank 25 chat.
[94:52.10]That's funny.
[94:52.82]Rank 25.
[94:59.33]What else is there to do?
[95:00.13]Let me just look at this other shit.
[95:02.31]I'm not going to poison that.
[95:03.59]I want to look... I don't even know what I'm getting myself into when I go over to that new guy.
[95:12.73]Fried figs.
[95:13.53]Stay safe.
[95:17.25]Okay.
[95:20.27]I've got the fiber wire now.
[95:21.35]He'll die silently and then I can dump him.
[95:23.31]Hopefully.
[95:25.43]Hopefully.
[95:26.49]Soda cans.
[95:26.99]These are important.
[95:28.83]Okay.
[95:30.37]Let's do it.
[95:41.87]You had it right since the start.
[95:43.37]That's what I thought too, but I just keep getting screwed over by one dumb pedestrian.
[95:48.88]And I can't kill her because if I... Okay, let's say I fiberwire her right now, right?
[95:57.64]Every time somebody dies right here, I get seen.
[96:06.30]I gotta choke the hell out of this guy.
[96:10.32]And then fiberwire him.
[96:15.27]Here we go.
[96:20.53]Go on and check it out.
[96:25.70]Dump them.
[96:26.46]Disguise.
[96:33.10]Anybody walking over here yet?

[108:31.63]There's nothing up here.
[108:35.23]Who the hell is this guy?
[108:40.06]Is that guy allowed to be somewhere?
[108:42.06]He's the only person standing out here.
[108:43.28]I'm gonna take his costume and walk in.
[108:46.58]And leave this one here.
[109:02.28]No.
[109:05.16]He's right there.
[109:05.72]I can hear him through the wall.
[109:10.82]There he is.
[109:11.16]There's Colonel Sanders.
[109:14.26]What the hell is he doing?
[109:24.11]I gotta find the fucking yellow dude.
[109:25.79]The guy with the yellow shirt.
[109:35.05]I got so, like, off track.
[109:38.15]Go hustle some tourists, okay?
[109:41.43]I need an invite.
[109:42.25]Alright, well... Why did that fucking guy in the yellow shirt have to leave?
[109:54.01]He was my ticket in there.
[109:56.67]And I'm too afraid to do anything because there's no saves, and I can't fucking... I have to start over from the beginning if I fuck it up.
[110:03.68]So I'm not gonna fuck it up.
[110:05.32]I'll wait till I can do the damn thing.
[110:08.41]Wait a minute.
[110:10.23]Where's my intel?
[110:16.03]Didn't I get like a note?
[110:17.09]Where's that note?
[110:21.05]I could just go in shooting, but guess what?
[110:22.69]If I fuck that up, I have to start over from the very beginning and I don't want to do that.
[110:27.98]Didn't I pick up like a fucking note?
[110:34.65]Why is it not an intel?
[110:38.89]You know what I'm saying?
[110:49.96]I guess it didn't mean... I can't give that note to the bodyguard or something?
[110:55.73]Well, I'm going to try one more time.
[110:56.83]I'm going to look for the guy in the yellow and have him sit down.
[110:59.09]I thought that was him for one second.
[111:02.95]Why are there no saves?
[111:04.53]I'm too afraid to act on anything.
[111:06.09]On any impulse, on any instinct.
[111:08.95]Because I'm afraid I'll just lose.
[111:10.40]There he is!
[111:10.92]You!
[111:11.02]Jesus.
[111:11.34]Get in here.
[111:12.00]Get the fuck in here.
[111:12.86]And tell me all the goddamn secrets.
[111:16.20]And tell me how to win.
[111:31.57]I am curious.
[111:32.87]You see, I have this meeting in a few minutes.
[111:38.57]And it really is important to me.
[111:41.20]Can you give me an idea of the outcome?
[111:48.76]Sorry, but you are a storyteller, right?
[111:52.08]I am.
[111:53.35]And I see a man.
[111:55.49]A Chinese man.
[111:58.09]He is waiting for you on a rooftop.
[112:00.43]Will the meeting be a success?
[112:02.43]I also see... Death.
[112:05.21]The guy right there.
[112:06.07]Don't come in here.
[112:06.87]That's not good.
[112:08.07]I'm so nervous right now.
[112:11.50]This fucking stupid selfie lady is going to look and see.
[112:16.00]No, don't do that yet.
[112:17.94]Are you even looking into your crystal ball?
[112:34.72]I don't know what I did.
[112:35.30]Did I do it wrong?
[112:41.88]There it is!
[112:43.32]He dropped it!
[112:44.30]This is documents.
[112:51.11]What does that mean?
[113:02.73]He doesn't have clothes for me to take.
[113:05.24]Does he?
[113:12.88]I thought he was going to drop an item that I could pretend... Was I seriously so worried about fucking putting him in there?
[113:25.29]Wait, that was my source of intel?
[113:26.71]Like, how come I can't see it?
[113:33.02]I'd love to see that.
[113:39.87]I mean, I have the documents.
[113:42.31]Why isn't that not showing up anywhere?
[113:44.14]That's dumb.
[113:47.40]Well, were those documents my invite?
[113:49.68]I have no idea.
[113:50.36]Man, this is a mess.
[113:55.48]Wait, people are saying I screwed up.
[113:56.44]How did I screw it up?
[113:57.69]Get out of the fucking way.
[114:00.21]Am I supposed to let him talk?
[114:04.47]Well, I have, like, the documents now.
[114:09.06]I just have to show the documents.
[114:10.10]And this guy will be like, oh yeah, those are the documents.
[114:15.06]Come right in.
[114:24.65]I need to see an invite.
[114:26.77]How do I show it to him?
[114:27.39]Okay.
[114:27.49]Well, please let me know if you need anything.
[114:33.71]Enjoy your evening.

[115:36.20]It's getting pretty close for me just to toss a mine and run.
[115:43.48]go to the meeting.
[115:44.24]Apparently I don't know where that meeting is.
[115:47.48]Because I killed the guy too fast.
[115:48.84]But I wasn't saying any words.
[115:52.67]He stopped his dialogue.
[115:53.65]There it is.

[117:40.70]I thought this was gonna be like a simple mission where I like... I'm gonna throw a soda can at that guy.
[117:45.28]I thought this was gonna be like a simple mission where I take a guy into the fucking fortune teller room.
[117:48.63]No, apparently there's like three people with intel and I have to fucking get documents.
[117:54.85]What is this?
[118:01.26]No, those are scissors.
[118:01.92]I thought that was a giant key.
[118:09.30]Somebody said there was a key back here.
[118:10.58]Where's the magic key?
[118:21.21]I know it's incredibly simple, but they went from like stupid easy to like needing to listen to people talk.

[118:32.20]I don't even care.
[118:32.82]I'll stop.
[118:33.86]I'm going to do a different mission than this one.
[118:37.51]I'm throwing scissors in the guy's fucking head and running to the exit.
[118:42.35]Just gonna whip a mine in there and run.
[118:46.21]Documents are a red herring.
[118:47.97]No, because this is like a regular mission that it's like I'm picking up normal story mission items.
[118:52.25]I never did this mission.
[118:53.11]Did I do this mission?
[118:56.77]I don't remember doing this mission at all.
[118:59.49]Unless it's like a completely different way to do one of the other missions.
[119:01.61]I've never seen anything so beautiful in my life.
[119:06.82]I'm going to do one of the other missions.
[119:10.36]I'm sick of the fucking fortune teller mission.
[119:12.25]Because I fucked it up.
[119:13.13]And when you fuck it up, you can't do it.
[119:14.59]Unless you go find this key.
[119:17.35]So I'm frisbeeing a mine in there.
[119:19.43]And if it works, it works.
[119:20.15]And if it doesn't, then fuck it.
[119:21.09]Wait, what about back here?
[119:25.67]Anything back here that I can do?
[119:28.67]Fuck it.
[119:31.15]We've been here for a while.
[119:32.09]I just want to get out of here and try one of the other ones.
[119:37.18]Oh, it's part of a bonus mission?
[119:42.86]I've never been here before.
[119:43.94]I don't remember any of this.
[119:47.52]Hi guys.
[119:49.92]Where is he?
[119:50.68]When he walks across is when I'm gonna do it.
[119:56.31]Nope, we're doing it now.
[120:05.10]He's still sitting down.
[120:06.94]Get up.
[120:07.64]Get up and run out here.
[120:12.12]Get up and run out here.
[120:14.96]No, he's got like a gun in his hand.
[120:20.49]He ain't gonna leave that room.
[120:21.43]We're gonna go Rambo because I've already fucked up the mission.
[120:27.89]Shoot him!
[120:28.27]What the fuck was that?
[120:32.25]I wish I could close the door.
[120:33.77]That'd be fantastic.
[120:38.52]There's a guy in the way, of course.
[120:39.60]What?
[120:39.72]Here we go.
[120:40.08]Here we go.
[120:42.68]Where is he?
[120:43.52]Where the fuck did he go?
[121:11.76]Where are they going?
[121:12.62]Where the fuck is it?
[121:13.36]Like a whole army going up there.
[121:19.86]Oh my god, they like went through like the escape valve.
[121:27.47]At least I'm back here now.
[121:28.43]Oh good, he went up- he went upstairs.
[121:34.53]Please stop getting stuck!
[121:37.98]This is causing me too much stress, this fucking noise.
[121:40.46]How do I turn off the alarm?
[121:44.06]Where did they go?
[121:44.96]Where are the stairs?
[121:45.94]I am so confused right now.
[121:52.51]Where the fuck are the stairs?
[121:53.69]No, this is just a bathroom.
[122:02.03]I'm looking at the mini-map, there's no stairs here unless I have to go out and around.
[122:08.30]No, this is just a bar.
[122:13.53]I gotta get the fuck out of this.
[122:15.55]I have to go like this way.
[122:16.83]I'm going around.
[122:22.81]There's stairs over here, right?
[122:28.18]I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[122:29.26]I don't even care.
[122:36.09]I'm going somewhere else.
[122:40.02]I can't concentrate on that fucking mission right now.
[122:42.62]I'm going somewhere else.
[122:46.88]They ran out the front door?
[122:48.08]Well, I... What?
[122:50.22]Get me the fuck out of that shit.
[122:51.82]Alright, let's go to... Let's go to... Let's go to this place.
[123:02.85]Too many beeps.
[123:04.19]Couldn't take it anymore.
[123:12.26]Like, oh my god, I was gonna fucking smash my head into my desk.
[123:18.31]Let's do this one.
[123:23.73]Yeah, the mission was wicked easy, but I fucked it up in the very beginning and I was just running around like a dipstick.
[123:32.97]Your target is Dino Bosco, the film's director and leading man.
[123:38.02]A washed up character actor, Bosco sees the icon as his big comeback, unfortunately.
[123:44.49]His rampant perfectionism and complete disregard for the budget has left Laventura on the verge of bankruptcy.
[123:51.31]Still, he doggedly refuses to wrap the production.
[123:55.03]Laventura cannot fire Bosco without violating their contract.
[123:59.38]That is why they have asked us to retire him before the whole studio goes belly up.
[124:05.02]I will leave you to prepare.
[124:07.34]So, uh, something that we need to be very, very aware of here.
[124:11.73]Um...
[124:13.66]One of the main reasons why I had no fucking idea what was going on in that last mission is because I was not even playing... I didn't even do the bonus mission.
[124:23.48]I was running around like having no idea what the fuck I even was.
[124:28.30]Now I can actually play a bonus mission.
[124:32.29]That's what I get for doing like one of the random escalated target missions in a thing I've never even done.
[124:40.21]Stop making fun of me.
[124:42.75]See?
[124:45.67]Anybody else makes fun of me in this chat, I swear to God.
[124:48.13]I'm... I'm gonna go take a piss.
[124:54.05]Alright, let me see.
[124:55.26]Coin, fiber wire, ICA, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[124:57.64]Get rid of Iron Man.
[124:58.52]Let's do it.
[125:05.72]Yeah, yeah, whatever.
[125:07.02]I'm gonna go pee.
[125:24.88]I haven't really been playing for like two hours.
[125:26.64]I'm having fun.
[125:26.94]Welcome to Sapienza 47.
[125:29.52]Today's shoot is already in progress.
[125:31.40]Alright, let's do this one.
[125:32.00]For the sake of authenticity, Dino Bosco's icon costume is genuinely bulletproof.
[125:37.76]He does, however, insist on doing his own stunts.
[125:40.79]Aw, can I fuck up one of his stunts?
[125:42.51]I suggest you take advantage of Murphy's Law.
[125:46.15]Good luck, 47.
[125:46.55]Cool, cool, cool.
[125:48.83]Alright, this is an actual mission.
[125:52.06]What do we got?
[125:53.50]Opportunities.
[125:54.06]An explosive ending.
[125:55.98]Light my fire.
[125:57.12]Something to chew on.
[125:59.07]Or time to meet the fans.
[126:02.37]Hmm.
[126:07.79]I think time to meet the fans sounds fun.
[126:18.65]This is awesome.
[126:20.25]Why am I hearing him twice?
[126:22.77]Oh, here comes the fan meetup.
[126:50.65]Guy in a crane?
[126:51.53]That's so cool.
[126:52.13]Oh, man.
[126:52.29]I don't know.
[126:52.55]I think I kind of want to grind him up.
[126:54.31]I just want this shoot to end.
[127:07.19]I mean, it can't happen anyway.
[127:08.82]Yeah, we're doing that one.
[127:09.40]A little tampering, the prop teeth can be made lethal.
[127:12.64]And apparently, Dino Bosco does his own stunts.
[127:16.32]Always good to see an actor willing to die for his art.
[127:19.76]We're grinding this guy up.
[127:20.86]Sir, I'm sorry, this is a restricted area.
[127:23.85]Yeah, you don't want to go up to the head and double check.
[127:26.81]How was I supposed to know that?
[127:28.69]Will do.
[127:29.91]Look.
[127:31.09]Look at this.
[127:31.39]You're not mad at those guys.
[127:32.49]Those random guys with the red shirts on.
[127:34.63]Never mind.
[127:34.95]I was wrong.
[127:35.31]They have badges.
[127:35.97]Let's chew them up.
[127:51.06]Oh, let's go this way then.
[127:52.42]Let's go all the way around.
[127:54.72]How come these guys don't care?
[127:56.10]Am I allowed to be back here?
[128:19.63]Maybe?
[128:19.87]Apparently.
[128:22.37]Nope.
[128:24.65]I can't, but can I climb in the window?
[128:25.91]Nope.
[128:28.22]Can't climb in the window.
[128:29.38]I need to get in there, though.
[128:35.22]I wonder if I can... There's a key.
[128:37.22]Is this the key?
[128:49.68]It is not.
[128:50.30]I have a town hall key now.
[128:54.06]Any other entrance?
[128:55.86]Random lady.
[128:56.28]Don't care.
[128:57.06]What about in here?
[128:58.46]No, this is locked too.
[129:18.44]Well... New opportunity.
[129:20.46]Robot teeth.
[129:20.94]I need a special effects shirt.
[129:22.24]What the fuck is that doing?
[129:23.64]Let's go back around.
[129:46.03]It's too bad there's not just a guy sitting out here with a fucking shirt on.
[129:50.12]It's just a lady that's in the way.
[129:53.38]Please get out of the way, lady.
[129:54.36]I want to look at the map.
[130:02.02]What is the town hall?
[130:06.79]There he is.
[130:09.51]Can't really get by.
[130:13.37]Town hall.
[130:14.15]I haven't seen you.
[130:15.47]The good old town hall key.
[130:20.29]Is this lady still... town hall key?
[130:29.88]These guys don't seem to give a shit.
[130:31.42]Okay.
[130:40.76]Can I get rid of one of these guys?
[130:42.54]Silently?
[130:43.28]Do they... More than two?
[130:48.58]Hmm.
[130:51.58]Just out of curiosity's sake, I want to know.
[130:55.34]It's possible.
[130:56.82]Let's see.
[130:57.18]I'm going to try to lure this guy in here and just get his outfit.
[131:13.27]That guy's on the phone.
[131:13.93]He's not going to be paying attention.
[131:14.89]At least, hopefully.
[131:18.62]Hopefully he won't be paying attention.
[131:25.41]Oh, what if I throw the coin in there?
[131:29.45]Maybe he'll open the door for me.
[131:32.89]That actually might work.
[131:34.67]As odd as that is.
[131:39.14]Can I get it in there from here?
[131:40.14]Let's see.
[131:45.44]Is it glass on that window?
[131:47.16]It's broken.
[131:47.68]Why can I not throw it in there?
[131:48.66]I can, apparently.
[132:03.65]Open the door.
[132:06.79]Go open it.
[132:11.77]Is it glass here?
[132:12.55]This looks like a chick's shattered glass.
[132:15.87]There's... Okay, that looks like broken... That looked like a broken window.
[132:19.87]No, it's just like weird paint on it.
[132:22.39]Okay, well... Never mind.
[132:26.35]I'll do plan B. I fucking hate myself.
[132:35.80]Right when the door fucking closes.
[132:39.02]I want to smash my mouth into the fucking desk.
[132:41.18]Hey, you hear that?
[132:49.46]Why don't you come in here and investigate?
[132:56.04]I don't fucking care right now.
[133:02.09]Do you have a key on you?
[133:07.51]That's all I wanted to know from this whole thing.
[133:10.41]No, he was sitting on the coin.
[133:11.97]Oh, you're gonna pay for this.
[133:15.72]None of these guys had it on them.
[133:16.70]I needed to know if there was a key.
[133:18.00]There's no key.
[133:18.44]One shot kills.
[133:18.88]Oh my god, fuck off.
[133:20.20]He's doing one shot kills.
[133:40.55]He has the key?
[133:41.65]What?
[133:42.19]Where is it?
[133:42.87]I do not see a key here.
[133:44.88]I see, like, coins.
[133:45.96]Okay, he turned around quick.
[133:47.06]Coin.
[134:11.63]Nobody over here has a key.
[134:16.33]Why are you guys saying that there's a key on these guys?
[134:18.20]There's no key.
[134:23.56]Am I being lied to?
[134:24.52]The one by the door?
[134:33.88]What are you guys talking about?
[134:35.15]What?
[134:40.51]There's no key.
[134:42.09]Everyone's yelling at me and now I'm gonna fucking lose.
[134:44.17]Shut up, lady.
[134:52.43]Shoot the glass?
[134:53.29]I should restart the mission.
[135:01.04]I just want to know if they had a key on them.
[135:02.84]Yeah, everyone knows at this point.
[135:06.35]Yeah, restart.
[135:10.39]Alright, can confirm no key on those guys.
[135:18.12]Disguised as the woman.
[135:22.30]He's doing one-shot kills, holy shit!
[135:26.24]Okay, let's go.
[135:33.15]Uhh, we're doing meet the fans.
[135:47.75]Didn't see me there.
[135:49.27]I didn't see you there, actually.
[135:54.15]Alright.
[135:57.27]Every single place is guarded.
[135:59.25]But, I mean, technically it should be able to... Every door is fucking locked.
[136:03.29]One thing that annoys me about this game is... Having every door be locked in missions like this.
[136:11.08]It's annoying.
[136:14.11]Go find the key.
[136:16.91]Because I can't get in there.
[136:18.91]Let's say I distract this guy and I get over there.
[136:20.47]I'm not going to be able to get in that door.
[136:22.49]Make sure you go get a key.
[136:33.24]Let's bring a lockpick.
[136:40.72]I'm going to restart and bring a lockpick.
[136:43.92]Like, what the fuck?
[136:53.33]Oh, what?
[136:57.61]Just shoot him?
[136:58.83]I can't work that way.
[137:02.45]What the fuck just happened?
[137:07.94]Contracts, it was... No, what was it?
[137:10.66]It was here.
[137:18.35]Bonus mission.
[137:26.65]Because if I can break in that room, I can get in there.
[137:29.81]Needing a key for every door sucks.
[137:32.41]Asshole.
[137:36.51]I want to plan my mission and take people out.
[137:38.89]I don't want to go looking for fucking keys in a treasure hunt.
[137:42.89]Let me play the game.
[137:43.88]What?
[137:50.88]It would make sense, okay, like lore and story wise.
[137:54.62]It would make sense, but there's people going in and out of those rooms.
[137:56.49]There's like random fucking pedestrians going in those rooms.
[138:02.31]Cast up.
[138:09.33]Like who the fuck are these people?
[138:10.27]There's a security guard in there.
[138:14.61]If I see a guy, a random guy, like a random sous chef, and a lady on a phone.
[138:20.90]Who fucking let you in there?
[138:21.80]Where's your key?
[138:23.58]Dickheads.
[138:30.18]Alright, let's do... Where is it?
[138:31.49]I don't think I've ever used this.
[138:52.15]Okay, I'm not supposed to be in here.
[138:55.67]Absolutely not.
[138:56.47]Is there a disguise that I can just take?
[139:04.20]Rat poison?
[139:07.38]Oh, a key!
[139:13.66]Now, costume down here.
[139:15.80]This is going to be dangerous.
[139:18.94]Can I save it here?
[139:20.04]Yeah, I can.
[139:24.96]I had the town hall key.
[139:25.96]I know, but like, I... It's just, I don't know.
[139:29.92]I don't like the key thing.
[139:32.51]Unless it's part of like the mission.
[139:34.57]Having to go search for a fucking key that's like three pixels wide on the screen.
[139:40.43]Wait, what?
[139:43.09]Okay.
[139:44.23]What do I have to do with this person?
[139:47.83]Shit, the ice cream lady is the person I have to talk to or kill?
[139:49.99]Uh, that didn't open that door.
[139:55.18]There's got to be something up here that I can take to not be a regular default guy in the waiter costume.
[140:03.28]I got seen in a security fucking whatever.
[140:04.98]I'm being recorded breaking into this room.
[140:13.59]Come on, outfit.
[140:14.87]Give me an outfit.
[140:18.97]One of you idiots has to have shit lying around, right?
[140:25.21]Apparently not.
[140:30.46]Toilet.
[140:33.06]Climb through the window.
[140:34.00]I need a costume first.
[140:35.96]Any computer programs I can steal?
[140:47.55]Is anybody even up here?
[140:56.79]It's so populated downstairs too.
[140:59.77]Shit.
[141:01.08]Well, we're going to have to use our coin skills.
[141:11.64]On this guy.
[141:12.18]Actually, that's probably the best person to do it to.
[141:26.03]Did he hear that?
[141:26.46]He did.
[141:38.61]Come here!
[141:43.59]We good?
[141:44.41]We good.
[141:48.80]Okay, I need to dump him somewhere.
[141:49.86]There's like a hundred places.
[141:51.88]I'm being just on camera recorded dragging this guy up the stairs.
[141:57.96]I wonder what's happening here.
[142:00.18]Don't worry.
[142:02.26]We're just doing a prank.
[142:09.97]Security cameras.
[142:11.93]Hey, can you see this?
[142:15.20]Now pick his lock.
[142:17.64]Alright, we're good.
[142:18.46]Save it.
[142:21.16]Smile.
[142:24.78]Where even is the camera?
[142:27.21]We just might give the finger remote.
[142:34.54]Alright, I need to go in the ice cream shop.
[142:36.96]Which I can go the other way, I think.
[142:41.37]There's one person that'll see through me.
[142:43.29]And I can't even walk in here because I need to unlock it.
[142:47.65]Alright.
[142:49.03]Well.
[142:49.35]And there's a guy that's going to look right through me.
[142:51.47]No, I'm going to do this.
[142:55.35]If I go up and around, like, remember when I opened the door and I freaked out because the ice cream lady was right here?
[142:59.73]I'm just going to go this way and do it from the other side.
[143:06.76]And with that... No, not that way.
[143:11.06]Right here.
[143:14.94]Hey!
[143:16.78]I'm not entirely sure what I'm supposed to be doing in here, but I get... Hi.
[143:19.67]Game saved.
[143:32.98]Don't patronize me.
[143:34.56]Yeah, I know he's my client.
[143:36.14]That's why I set up this Q&A.
[143:37.66]To give him some decent exposure, but he's being a jerk.
[143:42.18]What are you saying?
[143:43.00]Poison the sushi.
[143:44.24]Sabotage the set to get him to do it?
[143:46.78]Look, that's not even funny, alright?
[143:48.98]Look, he's doing a fine job sabotaging this film and his career all by himself with his goddamn ego.
[143:53.76]Hey, asshole.
[143:57.14]I called to ask for your advice.
[143:59.34]The Q&A session?
[144:01.02]This could get complicated.
[144:02.28]A lot of witnesses around.
[144:04.66]Then again, a distraction of sorts could create a perfect setup.
[144:09.26]Not to be insulted, I'm dying here.
[144:11.10]Did a movie crew disguise, no.
[144:13.43]Yeah.
[144:15.55]Oh, yeah, okay.
[144:15.95]Apparently I gotta go back up the stairs.
[144:17.27]Did I miss an outfit up here?
[144:22.25]I thought I was extremely deliberate looking in this place.
[144:24.73]Apparently not.
[144:28.09]I didn't go all the way up the stairs.
[144:34.78]All the way on the roof.
[144:37.98]Alright.
[144:39.41]We got two guys.
[144:43.01]One that's on patrol.
[144:43.89]He's probably going to go down the... Yeah, I'll see you later.
[144:50.51]Okay, can I like push him on top of the other guy?
[144:54.73]I have to try.
[144:55.29]I'm not going to go down the stairs.
[145:04.45]I wonder if he stays up here.
[145:07.49]Even if I push him off this, that's not even going to kill him.
[145:10.47]It's going to mildly irritate him.
[145:12.39]I could push him off this way.
[145:13.59]Hold on.
[145:16.93]I want to see this.
[145:18.11]What are they going to do when this guy just falls like 200 feet?
[145:21.50]Target took one.
[145:36.20]Oh my god, a guy just fell.
[145:37.44]A guy just fell out of the fucking building.
[145:42.46]This is not the Jedi way.
[145:43.68]It is not.
[145:48.45]Alright, well.
[145:49.57]I think I could probably get rid of this guy silently.
[145:53.71]Even if I didn't, then who cares, right?
[145:57.84]There's one.
[146:01.92]And...
[146:05.47]There's two!
[146:11.53]Got the disguise.
[146:12.42]Hey, interrupt the shoot, huh?
[146:17.06]You want me to interrupt the shoot?
[146:20.84]I can interrupt the shoot for you.
[146:34.54]Interrupt the shoot!
[146:35.98]Oh my god, a dead guy just fell from the tower!
[146:42.52]I interrupted the shoot.
[146:45.67]I don't think anybody cares.
[146:59.57]Nobody... what?
[147:00.51]Nobody cares that I did that, apparently.
[147:02.77]I didn't interrupt the shoot enough.
[147:17.47]This guy is like, where is this coming from?
[147:24.82]They think he's just having like issues.
[147:28.26]I got him.
[147:30.50]I did it.
[147:30.96]I killed him.
[147:35.70]Are you serious?
[147:36.70]Okay, I think I did it.
[147:42.00]I got him.
[147:45.14]I got him.
[147:49.98]Oh, boy.
[147:50.72]I can't believe I did it.
[147:55.40]I win.
[147:55.74]I hate this.
[148:06.49]Exit.
[148:06.77]Exit.
[148:07.51]Exit.
[148:09.53]Exit.
[148:09.99]I can't believe I just did that.
[148:17.53]And we're going to do it the right way.
[148:19.52]So I did it.
[148:22.46]What a master hitman.
[148:26.64]We take off in the Ferrari.
[148:35.49]I need a key to get in the car.
[148:40.62]I need a key to get in the car.
[148:48.36]Let's load it.
[148:50.86]I didn't do that.
[148:51.56]We're gonna do it the right way.
[148:56.16]Fucking game about keys.
[149:01.59]Game about gosh darn keys.
[149:09.85]Do it right, don't worry.
[149:11.93]I actually can't believe I did that.
[149:13.51]I shot him, like, how many times did I shoot him?
[149:14.98]Like, 15 times?
[149:15.54]I'm not gonna kill you, dude.
[149:22.94]Calm down.
[149:24.00]I had a lockpick?
[149:25.48]I can't lockpick a car door.
[149:41.06]I couldn't do it.
[149:41.68]I need a gun, too.
[149:44.56]Alright, let's go.
[149:47.28]Interrupt the shoot.
[149:54.44]Should just be able to walk right on set, right?
[150:01.93]A flame?
[150:04.85]I gotta go down the stairs more.
[150:05.99]Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[150:12.79]All right.
[150:18.91]Let's go interrupt the troop.
[150:20.77]Save it so I don't have to run down those stairs again.
[150:22.91]Oh, man.
[150:28.59]I hope they get the pressure right this time.
[150:30.59]Yeah, you know, I hope it's not too high.
[150:32.99]Mm-hmm.
[150:34.89]I want to see this.
[150:37.92]You can't have all you film people running around here.
[150:40.12]You're not coming through here.
[150:42.47]What?
[150:44.45]He did not just seriously say, can't have all you film people running around here on the film set.
[150:48.58]Did he just do that?
[150:49.22]He did.
[150:52.14]Sorry, that's kind of unbelievable.
[150:57.08]Blah, blah, I know Steven Spielberg.
[150:59.15]Well, that's not gonna get you through here.
[151:00.95]What?
[151:03.39]I'm, like, supposed to be here.
[151:07.51]Just a sec.
[151:08.17]Who are you?
[151:08.83]Like, that just fucked me up.
[151:12.71]Oh, you're not supposed to be here, film crew guy, on the set.
[151:16.33]That's fucking dumb.
[151:19.67]I'm reloading that.
[151:21.23]I feel like something went wrong there.
[151:26.58]We can't have all you film crew people running around on the set with a hundred other film crew people.
[151:32.72]Probably need a key.
[151:37.63]Nah, I don't think so, Mr. Film Crew Man.
[151:40.75]He does that again.
[151:41.39]Action!
[151:44.62]Hey, you might be pals with Dino Bosco, but you're not coming through here.
[151:50.70]I guess I'm not allowed to be here somehow?
[151:54.73]Well, I gotta wait for that guy to get out of here.
[151:59.85]Dude that's smoking a cigarette right here.
[152:02.59]Oddly enough, they don't do anything about it though, somehow.
[152:06.69]I don't know why.
[152:14.46]Does he eventually leave?
[152:17.64]No, of course he does.
[152:18.60]He comes this way.
[152:19.30]Just hide behind the briefcases.
[152:27.95]Interrupt the chute.
[152:30.53]Time for a break.
[152:31.43]Break time.
[152:31.97]What is in here?
[152:44.93]Pyrotechnic manual?
[152:45.97]Aren't I supposed to be doing... I just closed myself in.
[152:53.73]No, I want to... Opportunity complete?
[152:56.71]Huh.
[152:56.89]Um... What was the point of me doing all that?
[153:19.11]Not sure.
[153:21.45]I guess we're doing the pyrotechnics part now.
[153:26.61]Take a wrench.
[153:28.91]Please don't get mad at me.
[153:29.75]Please don't get mad at me.
[153:30.47]Please don't get mad at me for doing this.
[153:31.67]Give me a fucking break.
[153:33.43]Okay.
[153:33.63]Sorry.
[153:33.85]Sorry.
[153:34.21]I didn't know I couldn't go back there as a crewman.
[153:50.23]That's such horse shit.
[153:53.93]Can I go all the way around?
[153:54.77]I'm not even sure if I can go all the way around.
[154:04.82]Just chew him up.
[154:05.72]I should have just chewed him up.
[154:06.70]You're right.
[154:10.82]Can I climb the vines?
[154:12.92]No, these guys are the same damn costume.
[154:18.29]I think I might just wrench the guy.
[154:21.76]Is there another way I can get over there?
[154:28.26]There's a bunch of people I can see through me.
[154:29.76]I wonder if I can use the terrain to my advantage.
[154:31.72]Okay.
[154:34.34]Well, the set is turned off.
[154:35.16]There we go.
[154:36.32]Okay.
[154:47.86]Who else is here?
[154:53.46]Too many people can see me, but there's only two people here.
[154:56.05]No, three.
[154:56.87]Shit.
[155:01.15]I need a disguise.
[155:06.91]That's how it's done.
[155:13.01]Ladies and gentlemen.
[155:14.31]That's how it's done.
[155:18.92]I'll be signing autographs after the show.
[155:27.97]Hey!
[155:29.07]Hey there, get up!
[155:32.25]Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!
[155:39.03]Hey you, how about doing your job?
[155:41.11]Clear out of here, for your own good.
[155:48.43]Enable manual trigger system.
[155:49.93]I gotta turn that on.
[155:52.11]Holy shit, this is such a pain in the ass.
[155:59.18]This one guy's gotta get out of here.
[156:02.98]I wonder if I can do this.
[156:06.46]I have it saved right there, so... Oh yeah, you have a red shirt on as a film crew.
[156:12.49]You're okay.
[156:15.55]Can I do it like over his shoulder?
[156:19.33]Can I do it over his shoulder?
[156:20.53]Alright, so now I gotta blow it?
[156:33.88]Report me, go for it.
[156:35.96]Hold on a second.
[156:36.62]Okay, well, um, okay.
[156:56.58]I can't screw that up like that again.
[156:59.38]Get reported.
[157:01.66]That guard's just jealous.
[157:06.94]Where are the explosives?
[157:08.74]It's like combining these opportunities on me now.
[157:15.75]So he's over here?
[157:17.39]Why?
[157:18.07]There's no bomb there?
[157:22.55]Do I have to activate?
[157:23.89]Should I have done that before I did all this?
[157:26.70]I thought the opportunities were like stand-alone things that you could do with any one of them.
[157:29.83]Because it's an opportunity complete.
[157:32.67]He's just over here.
[157:36.51]Am I just going to electrocute this guy right now?
[157:39.11]Like, is this how this is going to work?
[157:55.66]I mean, I have like this gap.
[157:56.68]It's so obvious that I'm doing this.
[158:08.38]People have often called me an artist, an enfant terrible.
[158:12.64]And a blockbuster like this seems strange for an auteur like myself.
[158:17.49]But I could identify with the character.
[158:20.61]Okay.
[158:21.11]He is an everyday Joe, by day, and a versatile man of action when needed.
[158:26.47]Alright, that was fun.
[158:28.03]I did it.
[158:32.68]We can't have broken shit like this on my set.
[158:36.71]I broke both these things.
[158:38.65]That's the funny part.
[158:44.49]Uh... Someone fix this thing right now.
[158:49.95]I got a bad feeling about this.
[158:51.41]Okay, move in.
[159:00.56]What?
[159:00.76]One random lady comes over and kicks it.
[159:07.71]Wait, I don't have the key.
[159:08.49]I need a key.
[159:09.63]I need a key to the car.
[159:14.82]Does he have the key on him?
[159:18.84]Where's this guy's key?
[159:22.24]No key.
[159:22.62]Do you see a key?
[159:23.96]Because I don't.
[159:24.94]I don't see a key.
[159:36.98]For the fucking Ferrari.
[159:38.02]I don't understand.
[159:45.95]Where was the key?
[159:50.21]Gotta go get a key.
[159:52.09]Hold on, guys.
[159:53.09]Gotta go get a fucking key to leave the mission.
[159:59.51]It's a bunch of dog shit.
[160:05.25]Make sure you go find the key!
[160:07.21]That guy's a step on the carpet.
[160:13.95]Get him!
[160:14.73]We shoot at the beach at 4, okay?
[160:35.50]So I have absolutely no idea where this guy's key is.
[160:39.14]Is it in his trailer?
[160:40.48]Round two.
[160:41.30]Go find key.
[160:42.20]Where's his trailer?
[160:46.04]Does he have one?
[160:46.86]I think it would be in this thing, right?
[160:50.26]It's like Winnebago.
[161:04.66]Let's see if I can come in here.
[161:07.48]Sir, you cannot hold it right there.
[161:09.26]No, I need a key to get in this one.
[161:10.56]Hold on, it's alright, I'll get in.
[161:12.82]On your knees.
[161:14.24]Just wait a second, let me just go get a key.
[161:15.92]You'll die if you don't give up the weapon.
[161:18.30]Hold on, excuse me.
[161:19.93]Just looking for a key.
[161:22.17]Oh no, that's not a key.
[161:23.27]This is not a key.
[161:24.43]Sorry, I thought that was a key.
[161:26.35]Target special forces.
[161:34.59]Fucking give me a break.
[161:38.69]I'm just going to do it and go the complete other direction and leave.
[161:48.38]He opened the door for you.
[161:56.34]Okay, time to leave.
[161:57.54]Not in the convenient exit, but the exit that's all the way to the other side of the...
[162:02.74]Fucking key shit, man.
[162:03.82]Let's do it again.
[162:04.40]Don't mind me.
[162:05.16]Everyone looking at me.
[162:05.76]Yep.
[162:05.84]Don't mind what I'm doing.
[162:06.48]Alright.
[162:07.00]Now I gotta go to the other exit.
[162:08.68]I wanna get a good view of this, though.
[162:32.96]This guy's filming.
[162:35.06]Look at these people all filming.
[162:37.20]Can we get a question?
[162:38.68]Whoa!
[162:45.05]How does it only kill one person?
[162:50.49]Okay.
[162:51.71]Where's the other exit?
[162:55.99]There's an exit here.
[162:57.97]Exit here.
[162:58.77]Is that the car one?
[162:59.79]That's the car exit, right?
[163:00.89]I gotta go all the way over here.
[163:04.68]Because that is the car.
[163:05.45]So I gotta go right, straight, down, like... I don't even know where the hell that is.
[163:14.85]Screw it.
[163:15.19]Whatever.
[163:15.47]We're just gonna go this way.
[163:19.14]This is just a dream.
[163:20.78]This is just a dream.
[163:21.90]This is just a dream.
[163:25.86]Okay.
[163:26.26]No.
[163:26.34]Nope.
[163:31.24]Let's go this way.
[163:32.38]Yeah, yeah, save it, save it, save it, save it.
[163:39.98]Does my lockpick not work on the car?
[163:41.26]I don't think so.
[163:42.28]I was in front of it with... Didn't I have a lockpick on me last time I tried that?
[163:47.99]We'll just go all the way down here.
[163:50.75]If there is a key that I need to get to get out of here, I'm going to be very unhappy.
[164:01.92]Do not put this behind a key.
[164:08.03]Thank God.
[164:09.45]Don't need a key to leave.
[164:10.73]Okay, I'm gonna... Okay.
[164:20.26]That was interesting.
[164:26.36]He phased through the door.
[164:28.96]Just go walk home, I know.
[164:36.81]Come on.
[164:38.13]Activate.
[164:38.49]What other bonus missions are there?
[164:43.63]I was the key.
[164:46.89]I don't see a key.
[164:48.95]What's this bonus mission?
[164:53.00]Okay, there's... Paris.
[164:57.40]Let's see what this one is.
[165:02.56]Is there a bonus mission for this place?
[165:04.52]No.
[165:05.74]There's a couple of these random ones.
[165:11.03]No, it's not a challenge.
[165:12.51]Do only certain places have bonus missions?
[165:19.51]Zero keys, zero points.
[165:21.26]Oh, Jesus.
[165:22.92]Oh, here we go.
[165:23.40]I was built on sand.
[165:24.30]There's another one.
[165:26.50]That's a hundred bucks from Never Trust a Purple.
[165:29.80]Thanks, dude.
[165:32.45]A hundred dollars.
[165:35.41]Zero keys, zero points.
[165:40.30]Oh, I got a hundred points.
[165:41.26]You gave me a hundred points.
[165:44.40]That's huge, dude.
[165:45.08]Thanks, man.
[165:46.58]Much love.
[165:47.98]I will be right back though.
[165:48.72]I do have to, I'm going to pee my pants if I don't go to the bathroom.
[165:51.00]So I'll be right back.
[165:52.82]There's no text here.
[165:55.44]It's supposed to say.
[165:56.02]All right, I'll be right back.
[168:02.69]Hey.
[168:04.36]Pee louder.
[168:05.08]Alright, in between missions, let me say thanks to some people.
[168:09.46]Obviously, never trust a purple.
[168:11.02]A hundred bucks is a huge amount of money.
[168:14.71]That's a big deal, man.
[168:15.65]Thank you.
[168:17.15]A hundred fucking dollars.
[168:19.37]And that's not the first time he's given a lot of bits.

[172:54.81]I'm lying.
[172:55.25]That didn't happen.
[172:56.51]I'm kidding.
[172:58.47]Let's play this bonus game.
[173:01.13]Let's play this bonus game now.
[173:08.55]Oh, no.
[173:09.19]Not another bit trade.

[173:59.19]Oh my god.
[173:59.89]He's a madman.
[174:02.29]He's a madman.
[174:03.19]Alright, we're gonna get back to the game.
[174:07.21]Thank you all so much.
[174:09.01]I never know what to say.
[174:10.82]But you guys are fucking crazy generous.
[174:13.32]I don't know what to say.
[174:14.20]I love you guys.
[174:14.74]There's nothing else I can say.
[174:15.98]Oh no.
[174:26.84]Here comes another one.
[174:29.34]Here comes another one.
[174:32.51]This is going to be, okay, Shadow Bolts with 10,000 bits, 100 bucks, says, German, this was going to be one of those touchy-feely donations, but I'm going to summarize it.
[174:45.23]Your content has brought me enjoyment for many years.
[174:47.17]Thanks for all the laughs.
[174:47.95]Here's the back pay for all of it.
[174:54.10]Thanks, man.
[174:57.47]That's really, really, really touching to hear somebody say that.
[175:03.77]And I hope I continue to do that.
[175:08.66]I hope I can continue to make you happy and make you laugh if it's possible.
[175:13.30]Because that's all I'm out here to do.
[175:16.61]I want to hang out with you guys.
[175:17.83]I want to chill.
[175:18.45]I want to make people laugh.
[175:19.51]I want to be fucking fun.
[175:20.73]I want you guys to learn things sometimes.
[175:23.77]And if you do and you don't, whatever.
[175:25.29]I'm just, I hope, I'm glad you're fucking entertained.
[175:28.00]I hope I can do a job.
[175:29.22]And if I'm not doing that, I need to work harder.
[175:32.42]So thank you so much, guys.
[175:39.53]Because that's my goal every day that I think about.
[175:44.51]Cry on stream.
[175:49.59]Let's- I don't even know what this one is.
[175:50.65]But we're gonna do it.
[175:59.69]What's that?
[175:59.99]That's the guy!
[176:00.45]That's the guy!
[176:00.89]It's the fucking yellow guy!
[176:02.50]I gotta kill this guy.
[176:05.38]That- okay.
[176:07.20]Hold on.
[176:07.94]This is the mission that I couldn't do because I never did it.
[176:10.14]He is unaware of Kong's secret meeting location.
[176:13.04]But we know that Kong is hosting a lavish party at the Shisha Cafe.
[176:16.79]And we suspect the meeting will take place nearby.
[176:19.51]Good luck, 47.
[176:20.01]We're getting tea.
[176:23.77]Shit.
[176:24.75]We're not getting tea anymore, I promise.
[176:29.63]Yeah.
[176:33.13]There we go.
[176:35.31]Alright.
[176:38.21]Patrick Gallo with 1500 bits.
[176:39.51]I gotta give German something so he thinks I'm cool too.
[176:41.79]No, don't.
[176:42.37]You don't have to do that.
[176:43.74]You're all cool.
[176:46.31]Polaratium 201.
[176:47.85]Why can't you pronounce it?
[176:48.65]Polaratium.
[177:00.39]Polar Autumn.
[177:01.99]Polar Autumn 201.
[177:03.81]What a fucking botch of a name that is for me.
[177:08.27]Polar Radio.
[177:11.17]Un-fucking-believable how dumb I am.
[177:13.66]Thanks for 500, man.
[177:15.00]And Frisky Boost 2000.
[177:17.26]You guys are fucking all amazing.
[177:20.88]Now I can actually do this mission, right?
[177:23.60]Because I was fucking this up before because I didn't know what this mission even was.
[177:26.84]I didn't know what the opportunities were.
[177:28.09]I had no idea.
[177:32.17]Gone shopping.
[177:34.27]Rent due.
[177:35.01]Yeah, this is... I shouldn't have done this first.
[177:37.79]The future foretold.
[177:38.85]Yeah, yeah.
[177:39.33]Waiting for the man.
[177:40.71]I'm going to actually do this now.
[177:42.51]And this is going to be easy because I know what to do, right?
[177:45.15]Don't say that because it might not even be true.
[177:46.61]You might fuck it up right now.
[177:53.41]Alright, let's view the intel.
[177:58.73]Oh my god.
[178:02.88]Oh, God, guys.
[178:08.57]Dumb enough to make $500 from peeing.
[178:12.74]And then diet beetles for $5,000.
[178:15.97]Oh, boy.
[178:16.47]Hold on.
[178:17.37]What did he say?
[178:17.87]I want to read this.
[178:21.36]Uh, Diabetles with 50 bucks.
[178:22.90]Well, if we're going to be sentimental, you more than any other internet person I've watched has brought me more joy and laughter than I could wish for.
[178:29.28]I've dealt with severe depression my whole life, and you've made me smile through all of it.
[178:33.32]I'm glad to give my money to someone who truly deserves it.
[178:39.39]Well, dude.
[178:41.97]You want me to get real here?
[178:45.24]I mean, I've had all kinds of problems with feeling like shit.
[178:51.46]In my, when I was younger, when I was like fucking 22, I felt like shit all the time.
[178:58.34]Especially like the 24-ish.
[179:01.42]When I got diagnosed with fucking all the intestinal stomach bullshit, I hated everything.
[179:07.58]I hated life, I hated myself, I hated everything.
[179:10.99]And I was somehow, I don't know how, I kind of just said at one point when I started to feel a little bit better, I was like, you know what, fuck it.
[179:18.93]I'm not going to be fucking sad.
[179:20.95]I'm not going to be depressed anymore.
[179:22.02]It's not going to happen.
[179:22.62]I'm not going to allow it to happen anymore.
[179:25.78]And if I can somehow help anybody else deal with those kind of problems, you have no fucking idea.
[179:34.71]You have no idea how happy that makes me.
[179:39.21]Even for one second, if you are able to get enjoyment out of this and forget the dumb shit that you have to go through, I'll do it a thousand more times, dude.
[179:50.87]That means a huge amount.
[179:53.42]That's more than money can buy.
[179:57.34]And you paid me $50 to say that?
[180:02.00]That's not something you ever expected to do.
[180:04.92]But I'm glad that at least you can feel some kind of comfort from any of this.
[180:09.84]And even from other streamers, too, and other YouTubers.
[180:12.00]I'm not the only one.
[180:14.36]There's plenty of really, really good, really smart people, really fun people that I'm sure you guys all have watched and care about.
[180:26.72]It, like... Getting paid this amount of money, you guys giving me this kind of money is...
[180:37.15]I'll take it, but at the same time, I think about, like... Like, you don't have to do this.
[180:46.80]I know some people feel like they want to, they have to, they need to, and shit like that, but you don't have to.
[180:53.58]I get enjoyment just from people hanging out here.
[180:56.60]And yeah, like, who doesn't want to take money, right?
[181:00.24]Who won't take money?
[181:02.40]But I could fucking care less if one person... If I got a dollar...
[181:07.70]I don't fucking give a shit.
[181:11.00]It's the fact that you guys are fucking here.
[181:13.50]Because you just being here changed my life immensely.
[181:17.43]I went from fucking... Dude, I uploaded, like, three videos, like, talking shit about nonsense, like, six years ago.
[181:22.79]I never thought I was going to have anybody care.
[181:24.11]You know what I mean?
[181:27.10]Like, this is not something I ever expected would ever happen.
[181:30.98]Ben, that's all I can say.
[181:33.06]I don't want to, like, do the whole, like...
[181:37.51]Oh, wow, I'm going to go off on this really empowering rant.
[181:41.57]Oh, listen to him.
[181:42.31]He's going to change our lives.
[181:44.81]It's hard for me to talk about it.
[181:48.77]It is.
[181:50.48]Because there's no way for me to describe what it feels like when I get this kind of extreme amount of support.
[181:57.94]It's hard to even describe it.
[182:03.82]I don't want anyone to ever think that this is like some...
[182:07.22]Like, made up bullshit that I'm saying.
[182:09.14]I don't want anyone to fucking think that.
[182:12.54]That's super important.
[182:14.00]Like, I want you guys to think I'm real.
[182:15.62]You know what I mean?
[182:19.55]I don't want to be some, like, fucking poster boy, like, streamer boy that, like, oh, well, I'm gonna fucking, please give me more money, and I'm gonna do all these sponsorships, and I'm gonna shout out all these companies, and I'll, like, listen to me, oh, I'm gonna tell you some, like, heartfelt stories.
[182:34.18]I just want to be a fucking real guy that you can just hang out with, and just, that you guys can be here with.
[182:38.30]That's it.
[182:41.00]Four more years.
[182:43.14]Yeah.
[182:43.66]Because I hate the idea that somebody doesn't think I'm like fucking actually talking truth.
[182:49.55]I don't want to be that guy.
[182:54.69]And if I ever become that guy, I want you guys to tell me.
[182:58.87]And I want it to be very known.
[183:00.47]I want you guys to tell me.
[183:01.31]If I ever do something stupid that you guys don't like or you guys think is like counterproductive to what I've always believed, tell me.
[183:08.49]Fucking scream at me.
[183:12.28]Because I never want to be that guy that just kind of... does it for money.
[183:17.58]As much as I'm getting paid to do it right now, but I don't want to do it for fucking money.
[183:23.18]You know what I mean?
[183:25.69]That's super important to me.
[183:28.47]Because I know it can turn into that really, really quickly.
[183:30.99]Like, oh, he gets a bunch of money, he's fucking making a ton of money from these people.
[183:36.00]I just don't want to be that guy.
[183:38.62]The guy that like treats you guys as if you're, you know, like my job.
[183:43.18]Like you guys are my job.
[183:47.89]Fruit seller.
[183:50.43]But that's the thing.
[183:50.95]I've never seen this as a quote unquote J-O-B.
[183:55.79]And I never want to turn it into one.
[183:59.79]You guys are all fucking awesome.
[184:01.77]I got nothing else to say.
[184:04.22]Except for, of course, to say thank you to Ruby R for giving $100 in the middle of that.
[184:12.15]So my sister met this customer.
[184:13.83]Really stood out.
[184:14.37]Looking sharp today, sir.
[184:17.61]Because it's my sister.
[184:19.13]And like I said, I want... She said a Frenchman came to her shop at the airport and asked for a fortune teller.
[184:25.65]Yeah, yeah.
[184:26.35]Frenchman in an airport.
[184:27.85]Yeah, yeah.
[184:28.79]Frenchman in an airport.
[184:29.92]Okay.
[184:30.40]See, I took my grandmother to a fortune teller the other day, and the fortune teller said a Frenchman would come to Marrakesh and... Apparently, Mandela is...
[184:45.54]Oh my goodness.
[184:50.96]Wait, I haven't even done anything funny.
[184:52.50]Hold on, I gotta do something funny.
[184:54.92]Quick.
[184:55.51]Before I start, like, crying.
[184:57.69]I gotta do something funny.
[184:59.07]Is it funny?
[185:00.97]Is that funny?
[185:01.59]Did I do something funny?
[185:03.03]This is actually Dr. Pepper.
[185:04.91]This really is Dr. Pepper.
[185:15.46]Hold on a second, guys.
[185:16.12]Let me do something funny.
[185:17.38]Okay, well, um... You don't give yourself enough credit.
[185:27.21]Your work touches hundreds of thousands of people, and you ask for nothing in return.
[185:31.21]Like I said, you're one of the few people I look up to in damn good reason.
[185:35.53]Um... That's extremely humbling, dude.
[185:39.79]It just is.
[185:41.78]Because I see myself as just some fucking dummy.
[185:44.35]I'm just like a guy that sits in the- I'm just a guy.
[185:46.97]I'm just a fucking guy.
[185:50.01]I don't want you to think of me any more than just a guy.
[185:52.03]Except for when I fucking drank that Dr. Pop on stream.
[185:55.85]That was a fucking sellout move.
[186:01.72]Your legit and sincere person thing.
[186:03.34]Well, never trust purple.
[186:04.14]That's $150.
[186:04.52]Like, my lord.
[186:08.97]And purple now has the, uh, firework logo.
[186:12.75]My goodness.
[186:15.10]You're a dummy.
[186:18.00]Not even just like a dummy, I'm just like a... You know what I mean?
[186:20.84]I don't know.
[186:23.94]I never know what to say.
[186:26.67]Because I don't have a plan for what I want to say.
[186:31.29]People, like, have this scripted response to this type of shit, and I don't.
[186:36.19]I'm off fucking script.
[186:40.83]If I have a go on script, that's when I have a problem.
[186:44.87]And then Hepper... On Twitch, you're the most sincere person on Twitch.
[186:49.51]You're always full of happiness and love.
[186:51.45]And that's when we'd love to take my bit energy and go get yourself a Dr. Pepper.
[186:56.93]I'm gonna... I'll be like this way for a little... Guys, I'm 30.
[186:59.07]30.
[186:59.85]I'm 30.
[187:01.09]I didn't say the other part, but I'm... I mean, I'm post 30.
[187:03.86]I don't think I'm gonna change after that, man.
[187:07.48]Menu is... I gotta do something funny.
[187:09.72]I know.
[187:09.96]Hold on.
[187:10.98]This is what you guys are paying for, right?
[187:13.04]Hold on.
[187:13.64]We got a snake in the bush.
[187:14.86]Hey, fuck you, buddy.
[187:15.54]Ooh, dude.
[187:17.22]Women tougher than you.
[187:18.75]Wow, that sex is bullshit, so let's get you killed.
[187:26.99]Old, old, old.
[187:29.53]Quick, be funny.
[187:37.49]Aye, aye, aye, aye, let's...
[187:41.43]Man.
[187:43.57]I don't even know what to do.
[187:52.10]You're 30?
[187:52.94]Fuck, you're almost dead.
[187:54.20]Better do something funny.
[188:00.66]Dude, I'm 31?
[188:02.96]Holy shit, I better do something funny.
[188:04.36]I'm almost dead.
[188:06.30]Can I throw like hot fucking chocolate buns at this guy?
[188:15.72]30 without a wife or a girlfriend.
[188:16.96]We're worthless.
[188:17.72]Oh, God.
[188:19.68]See how real I am?
[188:21.38]I'm 31.
[188:21.64]I don't even have any family.
[188:26.04]How real is that?
[188:29.93]Let's just do Intel.
[188:32.53]I only got 10 more seconds before I croak.
[188:37.98]Fuck, those bits were supposed to be for the sorcery ending.
[188:40.26]Guess I gotta buy some more.
[188:41.56]Oh, good.
[188:42.06]No, you don't have to.
[188:42.80]You're good.
[188:43.46]It's all good, man.
[188:44.76]You've given so much money.
[188:50.32]Let's do something.
[188:51.06]We already know what that one is.
[188:52.08]Let's do this one.
[188:53.30]It's all the rent guy.
[188:56.28]Tinder time.
[189:00.93]Fine hand-woven carpets.
[189:07.66]Fine hand-woven carpets.
[189:10.18]Ow!
[189:15.61]I can kill this guy in the... I know I can kill that guy as the fortune teller, so let's go this way.
[189:25.97]I laugh at your jokes because they are bad.
[189:29.06]Well, I... As long as you're enjoying yourself, man.
[189:32.40]That's all I care about.
[189:35.49]You could think I suck, I'm a moron, I'm a shithead.
[189:39.35]You could think I'm a bastard, not funny loser.
[189:42.33]But if you enjoyed yourself for a second.
[189:44.11]If you had any fun.
[189:46.05]And it was a success.
[189:47.64]According to Intel, Mr. Kong is hosting a private party behind those walls.
[189:59.99]All right, I got to get this guy's invitation.
[190:02.52]Sure.
[190:13.40]Just gotta get this guy in a dark alley and strangle him.
[190:16.05]You know how it works.
[190:20.49]I'm not having fun right now.
[190:22.27]Can't read Pinch here fast enough.
[190:24.71]The fact that I can make you feel good about what you do means so much to me.
[190:41.35]It is.
[190:41.81]It's working.
[190:42.25]Sometimes I do have thoughts about, you know... Am I doing a good enough job?
[190:47.14]Was that fun?
[190:47.64]Did people enjoy that?
[190:48.22]Did I come off as... Was it too much or was it not enough?
[191:01.69]When I was doing the German Rumble, the live one, that was a lot of what was going through my head.
[191:07.07]I always think about how to do things better to a fault.
[191:13.65]So I'm just happy to know that there's some people that are enjoying it, I guess.
[191:23.42]After every stream, I'll end the stream and I'm just like, was that good?
[191:26.68]Did people like that?
[191:29.30]What happened?
[191:30.88]Because I have a bad memory.
[191:31.82]I don't remember if, like, if I... I completely remember whole pieces of time if I looked at the chat and it was like, I hate you.
[191:37.38]And I'm like, wait, somebody hated me.
[191:39.12]It's gone.
[191:39.44]I forget it.
[191:43.75]Fuck you, like, knapsack.
[191:45.05]Hey, I need some help over... Over here, over here.
[191:50.19]You're crazy.
[191:50.85]What the hell?
[191:51.93]Ah, you bitch.
[191:52.85]I'm gonna get you for this.
[191:55.33]Huh?
[191:57.18]I lost him.
[191:58.40]I'm sorry.
[191:58.90]You're gonna have to leave.
[192:01.63]Oh yeah, I got the invite.
[192:08.62]Is that a chef shooting me?
[192:11.82]Oh my god.
[192:19.67]Get me out.
[192:27.97]Get me out.
[192:28.79]Get me out.
[192:30.42]I need a costume.
[192:32.07]Command.
[192:33.25]Hold it!
[192:33.95]Costume.
[192:34.86]This guy's costume.
[192:35.46]He's in that shop!
[192:38.88]No!
[192:39.48]God damn it!
[192:42.78]Why did I come back out for a fucking Halloween costume?
[192:48.06]Was that good?
[192:48.42]Was that funny?
[192:49.22]Was that good?
[192:49.52]Did anybody like that?
[192:50.13]I don't know.
[192:52.65]Fuck.
[192:54.63]I got too distracted because I... I got distracted.
[192:58.11]Welcome to Marrakesh 47.
[192:59.35]Mental.
[193:02.50]I freaked out because the guy had a fucking, like, fanny pack on.
[193:12.45]Not funny.
[193:12.91]Not funny enough.
[193:13.79]Oh, shit.
[193:14.21]What do I do?
[193:15.48]It wasn't funny enough.
[193:21.38]Hurry up and be funny.
[193:26.23]Is there all ad bits worth the stomach laughs in your stream?
[193:28.93]Oh my god.
[193:29.43]Thanks, dude.
[193:30.21]That's 800 bits.
[193:31.13]That's a lot of fucking ad watching.
[193:32.77]Alright, let me do this.
[193:37.03]Let me do this for real.
[193:40.35]Let me do this for real.
[193:42.51]I can actually... Okay, my brain is forgetting.
[193:44.51]I can actually save now.
[193:48.05]I'm doing this one.
[193:51.17]Gone shopping.
[193:55.03]The rise and fall of German IA5.
[194:04.06]I just got my first paycheck of 120 German bucks and I decided to spend it on the most entertaining thing.
[194:10.77]Watching your streams.
[194:12.19]YouTube since 2012.
[194:12.85]Oh man, that's a long time.
[194:18.00]Dude, like... That's fucking... It's like you guys are fucking too much.
[194:25.68]I'm so like... I'm so... I'm so grounded right now.
[194:30.85]No, no, no.
[194:31.55]Not like in the sense like my parents grounded me.
[194:33.45]I'm like grounded as in my feet are on the ground.
[194:37.19]And... I... I'm very humbled right now.
[194:42.76]So the guy was just throwing up.
[194:50.09]Make German Rumble live-action, too?
[194:52.06]Absolutely, I'm going to happen.
[194:53.40]That's going to happen.
[194:54.20]Absolutely.
[194:54.60]A couple things need to happen first, though.
[194:58.26]But the next one, you better believe, is going to be much bigger and much better.
[195:02.40]And each one thereafter is going to be even crazier than the next one.
[195:05.13]That's the goal.
[195:06.33]Alright, where's this, uh... Gotta get on the roof?
[195:15.08]He's up there.
[195:16.70]Okay.
[195:18.32]So, how is the carpet business?
[195:20.82]It's surprisingly good.
[195:22.76]Am I allowed to be in here?
[195:24.96]Do I not have the lock and pick?
[195:26.20]Oh, God, I don't have the lock.
[195:27.78]Can I get him to open this door?
[195:33.75]Sounds like that is someone very rich.
[195:37.65]I don't know.
[195:39.31]Whatever.
[195:40.25]What?
[195:41.61]Find out what that was.
[195:43.29]Loud and clear.
[195:45.25]I know what that was.
[195:45.89]Oh, loud and clear!
[195:47.89]It was a coin!
[195:50.61]He lied.
[195:51.87]He found a coin.
[195:54.05]That guy just pocketed that money.
[195:56.63]Little dick.
[195:57.19]I wish I could get this guy's attention.
[196:06.34]Of course I need a key.
[196:08.16]To get in.
[196:08.98]Huh.
[196:11.11]Too bad I don't have the stupid lockpick.
[196:14.55]I could have planned for this.
[196:17.29]Wait a minute.
[196:17.65]Shop key?
[196:19.24]No.
[196:19.62]Scissors.
[196:19.90]They always look like keys.
[196:21.78]Somebody's going in that room!
[196:22.80]Somebody's going in!
[196:23.98]Oh, you idiot.
[196:25.18]You let me in.
[196:27.60]You dummy.
[196:44.02]Another 1,000, another 1,500.
[196:45.20]I'll look at these after I get in a spot where I can chill for a second.
[196:52.48]So much money, man.
[196:53.97]So much money.
[196:57.13]Too much money.
[196:58.11]This is going to be nice.
[197:01.71]No, never mind.
[197:06.22]Coins.
[197:06.66]These guys both have a blip on their head.
[197:11.69]So we're going to do this.
[197:13.47]Go look at that.
[197:15.50]And while you're over there looking, I'm going to scissor you.
[197:19.46]What?
[197:21.24]What?
[197:21.46]At least you said that.
[197:28.18]It was perfect.
[197:41.79]Okay, now I gotta unlock the back door to the courtyard.
[197:44.93]Pick up his gun, too, just to complete the disguise.
[197:46.99]Do you have anything on you?
[197:49.30]No.
[197:51.10]What?
[197:54.52]That way.
[197:55.60]Save it.
[198:01.02]Snip, snip.
[198:02.84]Just a little snip, snip.
[198:03.95]No big deal.
[198:07.01]Somebody is...
[198:12.49]You heard that from all the way down there?
[198:13.97]Why is there not a guard checking this?
[198:15.77]Why is this random guy that's like a shopkeeper doing this?
[198:18.51]That guy took way too long to describe what he was seeing.
[198:39.65]Oh my god, I think that person over there might be dead And then I just get like I just shank him in the kidney I love this game No reason to come up the stairs, why would you come up alone?
[199:00.02]Why would you come up alone?
[199:07.75]You wouldn't tell anybody?
[199:08.83]You're not gonna tell anybody?
[199:10.97]I thought that sounded funny.
[199:14.41]Goodness.
[199:14.65]That guy can see through, apparently.
[199:30.25]Just bumping into everything right now.
[199:31.79]I'm being such a dummy.
[199:34.44]Weird.
[199:38.58]Hey, look at that second girl in the back door.
[199:47.88]I do.
[199:49.36]Thanks for noticing.
[199:52.94]Give you my dang goat?
[199:54.52]What?
[199:55.36]What does that mean?
[199:56.30]How come I keep seeing that?
[199:58.56]My dang goat?
[200:03.54]Opportunity completed.
[200:04.36]Now he's going to find a way to kill him.
[200:09.53]Screwdriver.
[200:10.13]Should I get the waiter costume?
[200:15.28]Fire alarm?
[200:20.24]He's right there.
[200:20.86]Where does he go?
[200:22.31]Bathroom?
[200:22.59]He is in the bathroom.
[200:23.73]I just gotta hide in the bathroom.
[200:24.95]When he washes his hands, screwdriver in the back of his head.
[200:30.77]That's all she wrote.
[200:49.95]That is Kong Duocuang.
[200:51.93]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[200:56.43]Can't blend in.
[200:57.05]Uh-oh.
[201:00.69]Crazy bastard.
[201:03.09]OK, I'm fine.
[201:07.39]Shit, he's just going to.
[201:12.04]I got to get in the bathroom.
[201:17.60]No fire alarm.
[201:18.28]I can get this guy in the bathroom without worrying about a thing.
[201:24.78]Screwdriver, absolutely.
[201:31.51]Please turn around.
[201:32.69]Please, he knows me well.
[201:33.69]You see, I... Please, please, he knows me well.
[201:36.01]You see, I once had a house on Mystique, and Mr. Con...
[201:39.76]Drop the door open.
[201:40.68]Bathroom, restroom, here we go.
[201:42.40]He's gonna hide in the stall.
[201:44.26]Oh, we gotta wrench him.
[201:45.96]Rat poison.
[201:46.86]Put rat poison in the toilet.
[201:47.92]When he drinks the toilet.
[201:50.31]No, um... Peep?
[201:50.69]What?
[202:09.69]WHAT?!
[202:09.93]Okay, for a second I thought this was gonna be like Porky's, that was gonna be really odd.
[202:16.93]This is what we do, we wait for him, and we wrench him when he pees.
[202:31.01]Eventually he has to go to the bathroom, right?
[202:34.15]Pervert.
[202:35.09]Now they can actually call me a pervert.
[202:37.72]Before it didn't make any sense.
[202:40.04]Now it does.
[202:40.44]I don't think that's the hole it's meant for.
[202:44.68]Wait a second!
[202:49.08]Can I, like, shoot him in the head through the hole?
[202:52.07]How crazy would that be?
[202:52.85]I'm gonna save it right here.
[203:00.15]Where is he?
[203:02.09]They're both down here now.
[203:04.87]Maybe they'll both go to the bathroom.
[203:10.60]Alright, here we go.
[203:12.40]On his way to the restroom, it seems.
[203:21.41]No, his bodyguard will hear the wrench.
[203:26.07]Hold on, what?
[203:32.32]These are the people.
[203:41.74]Can I shoot him through the hole?
[203:42.54]No, that didn't work.
[204:00.32]I guess I can like poison the water?
[204:03.50]I can do something.
[204:05.22]But I didn't do what I was supposed to do.
[204:06.84]I can put like a bomb there or something.
[204:11.23]Quick, stick your penis in the hole.
[204:15.59]Alright, here he comes.
[204:21.55]Talking on the phone really makes me have to use the bathroom.
[204:29.28]Oh, you idiot.
[204:31.02]Come on.
[204:31.46]Do we really have to throw a coin?
[204:38.16]What the hell is he doing?
[204:41.93]Please get in here.
[204:45.09]I could throw another... Somebody just broke a vase.
[204:55.86]Somebody just shattered a vase.
[205:00.98]Really?
[205:01.24]You're not... Oh, yeah.
[205:04.55]I'm in here.
[205:17.54]No, no, no, no.
[205:18.22]Keep investigating.
[205:23.61]Now he's dead.
[205:35.70]Oh, you stupid assholes.
[205:40.10]Pull the fire alarm.
[205:41.14]I'm done.
[205:43.07]No, wait, no, no, no, no, no.
[205:50.07]Hey, how you doing?
[205:51.05]Um, he was right here.
[205:55.32]Can I do... Turn off oil lamp.
[205:59.42]There's nothing else I can do in here?
[206:01.60]I can't, like, rat poison his ship?
[206:04.20]I need, like, a bomb.
[206:05.08]I don't have it.
[206:08.15]Let's turn it off.
[206:09.61]I'm not sure what that is gonna do, but... Okay.
[206:11.81]Okay.
[206:12.99]He smokes out of that pipe.
[206:14.69]I think I can poison that thing.
[206:17.15]Respect.
[206:18.47]Everywhere he is is where I'm going to have a problem.
[206:20.16]I wish I could frisbee something in there, Adam.
[206:22.64]Wait a minute.
[206:23.76]No.
[206:40.15]I wish I had the proximity bomb.
[206:41.39]I could just throw it over there right now.
[206:42.91]Turned off the lamp.
[206:43.87]What a madman.
[206:44.97]Oh, whoops.
[206:49.71]I didn't mean to do that.
[206:51.12]I'm sorry.
[207:08.56]Did it get him up?
[207:09.94]It did.
[207:13.61]I wish I could just throw my axe over or something.
[207:16.27]I'm getting bored.
[207:17.49]I'm getting bored.
[207:18.25]That's not good when I start getting bored.
[207:20.47]Bad things happen.
[207:23.41]Throw a soda over?
[207:24.75]I was gonna let go of that.
[207:27.18]I'll just throw a retro over there.
[207:30.76]Oh, do you need instructions for how to use the rubbish bin?
[207:43.09]Go look over there.
[207:43.77]Oh shit, I'm getting bored.
[207:46.47]That's not good.
[207:47.03]I'm getting bored.
[207:50.10]It's almost time.
[207:50.92]He sits there for so long.
[208:10.50]No, no, don't poison.
[208:11.28]Don't poison.
[208:11.78]I want to poison the one he goes to, but I'm like one step behind.
[208:14.62]I wish he would get out of that room.
[208:18.30]How much weed does this guy need to smoke?
[208:19.77]So I can poison it.
[208:20.91]Thank God.
[208:21.55]Get out of here.
[208:32.08]Where's his bodyguard?
[208:33.40]Alright, poison this.
[208:41.16]Poison the pipe.
[208:42.50]Now he'll die.
[208:44.32]I can just get out of here now.
[208:45.44]This is the wrench.
[208:49.73]You know, this time I can get away with it.
[208:50.89]I can get away with it.
[208:51.51]I can get away with it.
[208:52.17]I can get away with it.
[208:54.39]I can get away with it.
[208:59.01]I can get away with it.
[209:01.35]I can get away with it.
[209:02.12]I can get away with it.
[209:03.00]Who shot the gun?
[209:03.88]Somebody shot.
[209:09.26]I'm fucking- I got bored.
[209:11.20]I couldn't help it.
[209:13.10]No, not the sound!
[209:14.22]Not the sound!
[209:15.68]I gotta reload.
[209:17.40]I don't want to hear that sound.
[209:33.17]Alright, now I can just leave.
[209:37.62]Poisoned it.
[209:38.48]He's gonna smoke that and he's gonna die.
[209:39.76]Fuck off.
[209:41.72]What?
[209:41.86]Alright.
[210:00.61]Everyone's just letting me do that.
[210:03.51]Everyone stands like a deer in headlights and lets you smash them in the face.
[210:09.42]Okay.
[210:17.64]Eventually.
[210:23.03]I can focus on the other guy.
[210:24.09]He'll eventually die.
[210:24.85]I can leave.
[210:25.23]I can wait for him to move.
[210:27.79]Please don't get stuck on that.
[210:29.37]Like all of them.
[210:37.51]Wait, that's not going to kill him?
[210:38.57]What do you mean it's not going to kill him?
[210:42.37]I poisoned his shit.
[210:43.73]He's going to smoke it and die.
[210:50.26]Wait, does he come in the bathroom and puke?
[210:52.06]If that's the case, then that's what I'm going to do.
[210:55.30]I'll hide in the bathroom.
[211:01.53]Because he's going to come in here, right?
[211:07.18]I wish there was a fast forward button.
[211:11.72]So he comes in here to throw up.
[211:17.69]Oh boy.
[211:20.11]Okay, I'm seeing a lot of... It kills him and a lot of it just poisons him.
[211:24.19]And he... Well, that is kill him.
[211:27.15]Yeah, I'm out of here.
[211:29.23]I'm taking off.
[211:30.81]He's going to go in there and he's going to talk but he's going to smoke his hooker and die.
[211:35.05]That's fine.
[211:35.43]Let's get the other guy.
[211:36.21]Let's go be the fortune teller.
[211:38.03]And I can be complete with this.
[211:42.20]Don't do that.
[211:42.92]Get out.
[211:45.60]Get out of here.
[211:48.52]Alright.
[211:50.46]On to the next guy.
[211:52.34]What do you mean the area is being investigated?
[212:00.27]Why is the area being investigated?
[212:07.23]This is the one I poisoned, right?
[212:13.68]I'm sort of confused.
[212:15.16]Whatever.
[212:15.44]I don't think it was that big of a deal.
[212:19.28]Let's get out.
[212:24.40]Poisoned coffee.
[212:26.62]Seriously, I am like a mouse in a mousetrap right now.
[212:31.70]I can never get the fuck out of here.
[212:35.16]Who are you?
[212:37.81]I seriously am a fucking mouse in a maze.
[212:42.07]I came in, like, the back door.
[212:45.52]Honest to God, I came in the back door.
[212:47.34]Like, where is it?
[212:48.20]It's, like, not on the map.
[212:49.10]It's not on the fucking mini-map.
[212:54.26]Where the fuck is this?
[212:55.91]Where did I come in?
[213:02.01]Jesus.
[213:02.57]Like, there's a front door.
[213:03.89]I didn't come in the front door.
[213:04.77]I, like, snuck in, like, a back entrance.
[213:11.23]Gee, there it is.
[213:15.92]There's, like, the hidden fucking secret door.
[213:18.44]Not even on the mini-map.
[213:20.56]It is on the mini-map.
[213:21.32]Whatever.
[213:21.66]Don't pretend I didn't say that.
[213:26.26]New costume?
[213:27.62]Waiter?
[213:29.65]Yeah.
[213:33.43]I can't go through the main entrance because there's a guy that's standing there that'll see through my disguise.
[213:37.17]I have to go out this way.
[213:37.97]Alright, now let's focus on the other guy.
[213:41.97]Fortune teller.
[213:44.14]The other guy will die without any issue.
[213:48.24]And there's the other guy.
[213:49.52]Let's go take care of the fortune teller.
[213:53.40]Salaam alaikum.
[213:58.35]Rat poison won't kill him?
[213:59.21]Well, it's alright.
[213:59.71]I'll kill him before he has a chance to even think twice.
[214:04.64]Did I get him?
[214:07.46]What are they investigating?
[214:08.32]I don't know how it will go.
[214:26.55]Uh-huh.
[214:27.07]Well, good luck with that.
[214:30.91]Can I get in here without him seeing this?
[214:33.71]Wait, save this.
[214:34.53]Don't be an idiot.
[214:37.07]Hey, mister, this your work?
[214:40.33]Huh?
[214:40.51]Ah!
[214:54.45]I'm gonna be fine.
[214:55.98]There was too much gas in the way.
[215:07.06]Actually, this is fine.
[215:19.95]This guy coming in here?
[215:27.88]Don't mind me.
[215:28.26]I'm just in here with a dead body.
[215:33.02]I feel like the smoke is too thick.
[215:34.14]Okay, well, at least the guy that I am and me are in here.
[215:40.33]You can always use a wrench to fix problems.
[215:41.67]That's correct.
[215:45.29]See, this will be fine.
[215:52.07]I left for two hours and he's still playing this mission?
[215:55.93]No.
[215:58.35]No.
[215:58.59]I did other things.
[215:59.55]I did like two other missions.
[216:01.79]Oh god, I can't even imagine if I had not done this yet.
[216:05.85]This is like the actual real mission.
[216:08.61]How fucking hilarious.
[216:09.37]Wow, I feel bad for the people that left two hours ago and came back to me being in this closet again.
[216:14.71]It's like I have never left it.
[216:21.75]All right.
[216:23.23]Mosey on down.
[216:24.25]You're not going to open this door, are you, random lady?
[216:37.52]No, they're going to keep doing the thing.
[216:47.17]It was her.
[216:48.01]She did it.
[216:52.60]My opportunity is right now to just get out there.
[216:59.76]And hide him.
[217:01.50]Right when that guy turns the corner.
[217:08.11]Nope, never mind.
[217:15.31]No.
[217:17.27]Nope.
[217:18.71]This guy's...
[217:21.44]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[217:26.28]Get him!
[217:33.94]Okay, I'm fine.
[217:34.38]We're good.
[217:37.70]Although I can't go in the closet anymore.
[217:40.30]But, it's okay.
[217:41.08]I'm... They didn't see me do this.
[217:43.28]Nobody saw me do this at all.
[217:45.88]I'm fine.
[217:51.02]He's going to wait until they stop hunting.
[217:55.34]He's puking right now.
[217:58.34]Oh, for the love of God.
[218:00.42]Half of chat was right and half of chat was wrong.
[218:03.72]They said it would kill him, but nope.
[218:05.38]He's just throwing up in the toilet.
[218:09.62]He left the closet finally after two hours.
[218:15.82]That's great.
[218:19.74]I hope he just sits there the whole time throwing up.
[218:23.98]If he pukes the whole time then it will be okay.
[218:28.75]I sure would like this to stop being compromised.
[218:30.87]It would be nice.
[218:43.33]Why does it take them this long to figure it out?
[218:46.39]That there's a problem that can't be solved.
[218:51.04]I'm gonna have to rewind.
[218:53.32]Yeah, it's time to rewind.
[219:05.51]I gotta rewind.
[219:10.77]And the target... Yeah, I'm gonna have to go back and when that guy pukes, just wait for him.
[219:17.23]Do you have a fortune you need to be read?
[219:20.15]I can read your fortune.
[219:23.54]Come on in here.
[219:27.30]Lady.
[219:29.64]Lady.
[219:33.56]What is this lady doing?
[219:37.40]She cannot figure out how to exit or enter.
[219:39.96]I'm not sure which one.
[219:47.43]That is just so dangerous!
[219:49.75]That's what you get.
[219:50.29]Alright, reload it.
[219:57.26]I know I can stay here.
[219:58.12]I'm gonna go in the bathroom and just gonna have to wait it out.
[219:59.82]We'll talk about something.
[220:00.58]We'll, like, have a good talk.
[220:01.48]I have to learn the art of the deal.
[220:08.90]To the bathroom.
[220:12.93]The so-called live streamer is such a dump.
[220:16.13]It's so dangerous.
[220:17.75]I'm in charge of operations in Ghana.
[220:20.11]We're calling.
[220:21.59]Oh, sorry.
[220:24.27]Well, then we're in the same boat.
[220:27.60]Washed up streamer rewinds again, I know.
[220:35.32]I should be good to go now.
[220:40.10]Again.
[220:42.26]Into the bathroom.
[220:45.26]I hope he comes in this bathroom.
[220:49.00]And I need this to be quiet.
[220:50.68]This needs to be a quiet kill.
[220:57.85]As an insignificantly small YouTuber, are there any tips to get your videos out there?
[221:02.99]Um... I don't know.
[221:06.95]It's hard to say because it's a completely different breed than it was before.
[221:12.52]youtube five or six years ago was different because it was brand new you know you're talking about seven years ago when there weren't very many channels doing it so if you tried to stand out seven years ago it was much easier to stand out because there was less people to stand out in front of so I would say at this point
[221:36.06]The best advice I could probably give, excuse me, is to try to do something that you don't really see people do.
[221:43.76]Because if you want to do, like, hey, I'm going to be a gameplay commentator.
[221:48.06]Yeah.
[221:49.35]That, like, it would be very difficult to, like, start doing that now.
[221:55.13]I'm not saying it's impossible.
[221:56.49]I'm saying it would be, like, an extreme uphill battle.
[222:04.03]It's just it was a different world back then.
[222:10.33]So it's hard for me to give advice when I got into it.
[222:13.01]And the advice that I would have given would have been what I did five or six years ago, which isn't necessarily true now.
[222:20.93]But with places like Reddit, Reddit's like a big thing now.
[222:23.55]Like, you could get your videos seen by a lot of people if you do something that, you know, is funny or good or enough people care about it or enough people are talking about it.
[222:32.90]You can still do it.
[222:33.54]He's washing his hands right now.
[222:41.28]Did he pre-wash to come to the bathroom?
[222:43.82]No, of course not.
[222:47.18]It was a different world back then.
[222:48.94]Well, I mean, dude, that was... I'm 31 right now.
[222:51.28]I started making videos when I was, what, like 25?
[222:53.16]24 or something like that?
[222:59.50]Make sure I save because I don't want to have to wait here again.
[223:07.43]I don't make YouTube videos anymore.
[223:09.59]Well, I do, but just not as frequently.
[223:13.33]And the ones that I do make, I want to make them as good as I can.
[223:21.41]Not to sound cheesy, but I want to be like a second you.
[223:24.32]By the way, just wasted 70 bucks on you.
[223:26.92]Well, thank you, dude.
[223:28.02]I really appreciate it.
[223:30.10]But here's the thing.
[223:30.56]I'm going to stop you right there.
[223:31.42]I'm going to stop you right there.
[223:34.22]You want to be you.
[223:36.49]You want to be that guy.
[223:37.47]You want to be you.
[223:41.81]Because you can make a splash being yourself and being you.
[223:48.23]You don't want to be me.
[223:49.21]You want to be you.
[223:53.47]And that's advice I can give you as much as possible.
[223:57.42]You got to do you.
[224:03.68]Because there are some things that I can't do.
[224:10.05]Now, you can take inspiration from certain things, right?
[224:11.97]Like, I take inspiration from things.
[224:15.03]Over the course of my whole life.
[224:16.33]There's things that I've seen and laughed at that I thought were cool, or things that I thought were dumb, or whatever.
[224:22.32]But it's a lot easier for you to succeed if you do you, rather than trying to do somebody else.
[224:29.56]Oh, hey, hey, hey, he's about to puke, he's about to puke, he's about to puke.
[224:32.64]Save it.
[224:33.31]No, save it right here, because I just do something stupid.
[224:38.45]Does the body come in and hold his hair back?
[224:43.56]No, he just waits for him.
[224:51.37]Wait a minute, I can... Oh, shit.
[225:01.40]He's just in his own puke.
[225:05.50]In his own puke.
[225:07.40]Now put him in the laundry hamper.
[225:15.59]That was that was gross that was just gross How am I gonna get out of here he's coming in here to check on his friend I Love how he just forgets that he came in here Did somebody come in here that I was supposed to be protecting I think so Although I can't remember
[225:46.41]Alright, I need to go this way.
[225:48.71]Don't want to be seen by anybody.
[225:49.77]Like that guy.
[225:51.81]Sorry, I'm trying to hide from somebody.
[225:53.03]You gotta be kidding me.
[226:11.87]Is he a friend of yours?
[226:12.89]Let's try going to the front door.
[226:14.85]Just fucking reload it, drown him again.
[226:17.21]God damn it.
[226:17.93]That's so annoying.
[226:20.57]He walked right by me.
[226:29.31]He walked right by me.
[226:30.69]He happened to be looking the other way.
[226:32.43]Well, at least we get to kill this guy again.
[226:34.07]Let's do it in a little bit more fun.
[226:37.64]Oh, shit.
[226:46.10]Will he see me if I get near him?
[226:47.22]I'm curious.
[226:53.68]Can I, like, move him?
[226:59.86]Damn it.
[227:00.50]I was hoping I could, like, fucking make him throw up on the ground.
[227:03.02]No, don't open the door.
[227:08.09]You bastard!
[227:11.05]Target down.
[227:12.19]Two objectives remaining.
[227:14.77]Did he hear that?
[227:15.35]No.
[227:15.67]Okay, good.
[227:17.55]You bastard!
[227:22.83]Save it.
[227:28.65]Peep next to him.
[227:31.41]It didn't do anything.
[227:32.19]It can't distract him.
[227:37.83]Now he wants to come in?
[227:38.90]Who the hell are you?
[227:41.66]Why would he come in here?
[227:43.04]He didn't come in here last time.
[227:44.15]Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?
[227:47.71]Officer, there's a fight going down.
[227:49.45]We've got to break it up.
[227:52.53]like what he didn't do that last time why did he come in this time you did there's no reason for you to do that you didn't you didn't do it last time didn't do that last time
[228:20.94]I'm gonna decide to come in there now.
[228:23.36]Here he comes.
[228:25.38]I better, like, get out of the way.
[228:27.46]Considering this time he's gonna walk in the door.
[228:31.44]I'll be ready.
[228:35.96]Is he coming to go to the bathroom?
[228:40.71]Nope.
[228:41.15]You know, he just came to open the door and look.
[228:42.53]Remember when he did that the first time?
[228:45.07]No, I don't.
[228:48.13]Fucking wanker.
[228:53.93]I have to get by him, though.
[228:54.89]I gotta go this way.
[228:57.31]The door to get out of here is behind him there.
[228:59.89]Please tell me he goes that way.
[229:01.41]Stay over there.
[229:02.01]Stay over there.
[229:02.45]Stay over there.
[229:05.20]Keep that way.
[229:05.98]Thank you.
[229:06.54]Goodbye.
[229:09.60]Alright, we're good.

[229:44.12]Shut them off or something
[229:57.03]I wonder if that guy takes off.

[230:06.17]Do you remember the professional save scummer?
[230:13.00]Come on, man.

[231:33.55]I was surprised by something you said earlier.
[231:36.46]You said you know that I'm...
[231:40.22]living under an alias.
[231:44.89]We already did this.
[231:45.77]I already killed this guy.
[231:47.69]You're the only one that knows that.
[231:49.13]And I don't want to have to kill anybody or put out a, you know, contract.
[231:56.48]This guy's got to go away before I can do anything.
[231:58.34]Wait, what?
[232:01.58]Yeah, I've been on this mission for five hours.

[235:20.49]And it really is important to me.
[235:26.04]Can you give me an idea of the outcome?
[235:33.45]I'm sorry.
[235:35.07]You do that every hour.
[235:36.89]I am.
[235:38.18]And I see a man.
[235:40.30]A Chinese man.
[235:42.90]He is waiting for you on a rooftop.
[235:45.28]Press Q like a good Reaper.
[235:47.26]I also see death.
[235:51.71]That's not good.
[235:53.81]Is it Hamilton?
[235:54.51]No.
[235:56.21]I don't have to do anything with this guy.
[235:58.67]I just have two targets.
[235:59.37]This is just a bonus mission.
[236:00.45]They've given me so many Q opportunities.
[236:25.78]There was a lot of Q opportunities.
[236:29.30]Ooh, documents.
[236:30.24]All objectives complete.
[236:31.84]Now head towards an exit.
[236:34.96]Hey, I did the bonus mission.
[236:36.14]Cool.
[236:38.58]Is Jarrah seriously still on?
[236:39.80]No, I'm not seriously still on this mission.
[236:41.44]I promise.
[236:42.56]I came back.
[236:43.18]I left this mission like two and a half hours ago.
[236:48.82]We've done much more since.
[236:50.74]I promise you.
[236:51.44]All right.
[236:54.34]Is there any more bonus missions?
[237:13.79]It's been four hours.
[237:14.81]You haven't even done one mission.
[237:20.97]The last time I was doing... See, this is my own fault.
[237:26.69]I jumped into this kind of small mini mission zone without doing this first.
[237:32.13]So I had no fucking idea what was going on.
[237:34.21]I was picking up random objects that meant nothing.
[237:38.83]That was the issue.
[237:40.17]Now actually playing this, I could do those other missions now because I actually have seen what the hell is going on in this whole mission.
[237:45.43]31,000 points.
[237:51.00]I'll take it.
[237:54.46]No keys.
[237:55.85]Are there any more missions?
[237:57.75]What time is it right now?
[238:00.97]11 o'clock.
[238:06.72]Let's see.
[238:07.66]Destinations.
[238:08.82]Where have I not looked?
[238:09.86]There's this one.
[238:14.40]Prologue.
[238:14.98]The final test.
[238:16.06]Oh, this is the test.
[238:16.83]Okay.
[238:16.95]Okay.
[238:18.62]prologue arrival guided training final test um no there's no bonus missions here I don't think there's these these are the things I did without doing the fucking bonus mission I screwed myself up okay no let's go to what about paris did I look here already sorcery we're gonna save sorcery for a scheduled stream not tonight unfortunately sorry guys
[238:47.63]I wanted to have as much fun with Hitman on stream as possible.
[238:50.91]And try to do as many random missions as I could.
[238:53.35]There's the mission.
[238:56.39]I already did the bonus one.
[238:57.37]The icon.
[238:57.93]That one was fun.
[238:58.61]What about this one?
[239:04.24]I would amputate both arms just to have you look at me.
[239:06.32]Now this is the one I just did.
[239:11.60]Star just comes into these streams and just talks about how much we love each other.
[239:18.05]Club 27.
[239:18.39]Nope.
[239:18.95]Uh, Colorado.
[239:23.35]There's a bonus in Colorado.
[239:24.65]Come on.
[239:26.02]Nope.
[239:29.00]Do I have to, like, complete certain things to unlock the bonus missions?
[239:31.74]Is that how it works?
[239:33.96]I think we did them all.
[239:36.92]This is fun, though.
[239:37.88]And the thing is, like, you can play through.
[239:40.14]Like, see, challenge completed.
[239:41.12]25 out of 110.
[239:41.48]120.
[239:41.50]I, um...
[239:48.38]I'll probably play a lot of this off stream.
[239:49.90]And just kind of focus on stuff.
[239:51.52]Rather than axe murder people.
[239:54.06]But this was fun though.
[239:56.26]I guess I'm going to call it there.
[239:59.94]So that's going to be it.
[240:03.04]uh today was just kind of I wanted to get through at least this or sorcery but actually I got a lot of um people sent me emails and messages like oh please don't do sorcery off schedule because people want to be there for it and people can't be here a lot for uh off schedule streams
[240:22.20]So probably going to do Friday night again for sorcery and hopefully beat that game completely because I guess I have at least a couple hours left in the game.
[240:30.78]So we're doing Friday night sorcery.
[240:32.14]We're going to do something else for the week ahead.
[240:36.85]But you two have such a good relationship.
[240:42.57]Yeah, I want to save that because a lot of people enjoy watching that.
[240:45.15]So I wouldn't want to do that off schedule because then people wouldn't even know what's happening.
[240:50.00]But yeah, that's going to be it.
[240:52.74]There was a huge amount of money given today.
[240:56.34]And before I turn the stream off, I do want to say thank you for everybody.
[241:03.15]It always brings me back.
[241:04.71]Like I said, it grounds me anytime that happens.
[241:08.33]You guys all fucking rock.
[241:09.81]I'm happy that you can enjoy the stream if you do.
[241:12.13]And if you don't, if you happen to find the stream and you didn't like it, it wasn't for you, I'm sorry.
[241:17.26]I'll do better.
[241:21.04]Much love, guys.
[241:21.68]You guys all fucking rock.
[241:24.88]And I'll see you tomorrow at 7pm Eastern Time.
[241:27.48]That's when we're going to do something completely different.
[241:29.89]I'm not sure what it is.
[241:33.76]But there were some subs.
[241:35.10]I do want to say thanks to the subs before I get off.
