[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.06]Alright.
[00:03.44]Have you guys decided on... Let's see.
[00:10.76]Potential elimination.
[00:14.35]Or do we just do Xbox?
[00:20.39]I feel like 150 people would like to choose between these two.
[00:25.67]So we could eliminate tier lists.
[00:37.65]Let's do another one.
[00:43.00]Because I could care less either way.
[00:44.06]Alright, here we go.
[01:06.85]Add a neither option?
[01:16.99]Neither.
[01:18.57]Then it's like, alright, I'll see you later.
[01:32.90]Again, we're at the stage where it is so- it is too close that streamer might- streamer, which is me, might just have to pick one of these.
[01:41.53]262 to 262?
[01:46.25]268 to 264?
[02:13.75]It's too split.
[02:24.68]Here we go.
[02:26.62]I didn't vote.
[02:27.22]We'll vote.
[02:28.20]This is the only opportunity you're going to get.
[02:31.90]Do both.
[02:33.12]Both of these things will take more time than I would like to stay streaming.
[02:40.88]If I did both.
[02:44.22]alright we're getting close to where I'm gonna have to turn this down here turn this off and people now oh every now that I all I had to say was let's go it's still too close to call
[03:08.04]Looks like it's pulling away a little bit.
[03:11.09]It's pulling away.
[03:12.33]It's pulling out.
[03:13.25]I'm gonna have to do it.
[03:16.11]Oh, it's... Oh, we got about... If you haven't voted, this is your last opportunity.
[03:23.41]I'm gonna count from ten.
[03:26.45]Starting right now.
[03:30.13]Ten.
[03:31.56]Nine.
[03:32.74]Eight.
[03:34.22]Wait, hold on.
[03:34.72]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[03:37.40]People need to have the poll again.
[03:42.07]Okay.
[03:43.31]Just in case, this is it.
[03:44.35]Go do it.

[06:51.54]Stay mad.
[06:52.36]TT tears.
[06:54.78]Hey.
[06:57.80]A true champion does not brag about his win.
[07:04.14]A true champion does a shitload of interviews and is respected around the goddamn world.
[07:15.69]Which is essentially kind of the same thing.
[07:17.73]A true champion does not talk shit.
[07:24.10]Alright, I got this hopeless fucking captured.
[07:29.89]Hey, it did.

[08:37.02]Change the title of the stream.
[08:38.42]Family Feud 2012.
[08:42.06]Are you on the Twitch list?
[08:44.40]I wonder.
[08:47.28]I don't know.
[08:51.63]I am going to do myself a favor here, and I am going to unplug the fucking Kinect.
[08:55.95]Because I just saw a, like, that-so-raven vision of me sitting here with no clothes on.
[09:15.41]So, I'm going to make sure that don't happen.
[09:20.32]Alright, let me get my headphones in.
[09:26.62]The burnout camera.
[09:27.54]The only difference this time is I don't have a bathrobe on.
[09:29.95]Alright, I've updated the stream.
[09:36.43]Alright.
[09:42.23]Alright.
[09:44.25]Alright.
[09:45.03]Who's ready to go find this spot?
[09:52.20]You know what I love the most about anything is when monitors have touch-based fucking controls on them that don't work like 60% of the time.
[10:03.67]I love that so much.
[10:05.27]I love it.
[10:05.73]I'm using the Xbox.
[10:15.70]That's not the right controller.

[12:19.51]But they still had to tape the show.
[12:24.38]You'll score points for every top answer you give for these surveys.
[12:30.71]If you give me an answer that's not on the board, I'll give you a strike.
[12:35.39]When you have three strikes, the other family can try to steal your points.
[12:40.05]The family with the top score after four rounds gets to play for a $20,000 prize.
[12:45.75]How do we do that with just me, though?
[12:47.33]That's what I don't understand.

[12:55.34]The Kelps versus Tendon D. Rangoon's family.
[13:01.22]I guess I'll do it.
[13:01.92]Why do I have my avatar named?
[13:08.52]There are four answers on the board.
[13:11.36]The best answer gives you control of the board.

[23:01.94]This is the type of way you're supposed to perform on a stage for a play.
[23:06.89]You're supposed to over-annunciate, over-act so people can see you.
[23:10.35]We asked 100 people.

[93:00.35]This is unbelievable.
[93:01.45]Maybe your opponent will do better.
[93:05.34]Is there a better answer?
[93:06.96]An athlete, a pro athlete might keep in their locker photos.
[93:11.20]I'll take that.
[93:16.56]Um, this is not a high schooler.
[93:18.60]They threw that intentionally to win... They just took a knee.
[93:25.95]They just ran the clock out.
[93:29.17]Bastards.
[93:29.43]Alright, whatever.

[95:30.04]I feel like I'm not gonna be able to get these.
[95:46.89]Some of these are going to be really specific.
[95:48.16]You're going to pass.
[95:58.42]The worst part about going to the beach is driving.
[96:04.10]Driving to the beach.
[96:05.04]You're right.
[96:07.86]There are no strikes on the board.
[96:14.02]Jellyfish.

[96:32.52]That's not a bad one.
[96:34.80]Probably number one.
[96:37.16]Good work.
[96:40.27]You have one strike.
[96:48.77]All the crowds.
[96:53.41]Alright, they're still missing two.
[96:56.25]I gotta think of number one, then.
[96:57.21]Because if they don't get number one, then... I think it actually is sand.
[97:06.98]I can't believe it.
[97:09.86]The worst part about going to the beach is the sand.
[97:15.72]So, don't go to the beach.
[97:17.16]Why are you there?
[97:19.55]Eels?

[185:56.21]Thank you for watching, everybody.
[185:58.26]Close the tray.
[186:00.68]It's closed.

[187:17.40]This is now a sponsored stream.
[187:22.64]I didn't look.
[187:23.42]I didn't see a sandwich.
[187:26.17]There's no sandwich.
[187:33.01]Thank you for the $10.
[187:35.71]I really appreciate it.
[187:38.37]Now it's gotta be the whole thing.
[187:39.33]It's... The whole thing.
[187:40.19]But we got Sans.
[187:40.71]Yeah, we did.
[187:41.19]What do you mean, we?
[187:41.95]I don't, like... That wasn't something I wanted.
[188:11.02]I wanted fucking Geno.
[188:16.41]Yes, you did.
[188:18.17]I'm happy that Sans is in the game.
[188:20.65]But I didn't... I wasn't actively hoping that Sans was going to be in the game.
[188:26.89]It's cool.
[188:30.94]I mean, I would have... I would have loved Scrooge McDuck, too.
[188:39.28]But I don't think we're ever going to see that.
[188:40.90]In fact, I think we would probably see that before, Gino.
[188:48.89]Think about it.
[188:52.60]But, thank you.
[188:55.38]Thank you also to Gnarly for the $2.50.
[188:57.74]When are you going to play my favorite game, you fraudcaster?
[189:02.16]Have a good night.

[189:08.47]Because by 2030, I will have played every single one.
[189:14.50]Eventually I will.
[189:29.81]Thank you, AmnesticOW, for the $15.
[189:32.85]This is the song that is supposed to be intended for the Devourer of Gods.
[189:37.93]Is this from that song mod?
[189:42.64]Yeah, I never got this mod.
[189:50.44]Unfortunately.
[189:51.28]Let's give it a listen, though.
[189:53.72]This is the song.
[189:54.96]Terraria Calamity Mod, Universal Collapse is the name of this
[190:02.09]Hold on, I need to actually plug this in again.
[190:06.50]Oh, darn it.
[190:07.18]OK, dang it.
[190:10.34]Here it is.
[190:12.19]Alright, I'm curious.
[191:08.48]That has a nice ring to it.
[191:17.03]I don't know what that part was, though.
[191:22.83]Seems like that was added in somehow.
[191:25.21]That's a cool song.
[191:26.72]Sounds good.
[191:27.04]It's got a nice ring to it.
[191:36.99]Thank you, AmnesticOW, for the $15.
[191:40.04]That's a lot of money.
[191:41.42]Thank you.
[191:42.78]Sergeant Mars, thanks for the $5.
[191:44.24]Please buy a rat.
[191:45.10]I've not thought about that before.
[191:47.74]You gotta get two, though.
[192:03.53]That's something that would have to happen...
[192:07.38]You know, I would probably have, like, a couple of rats.
[192:10.52]I want, like, a cool bird, too.
[192:12.01]I want, like, a nice, like, beautiful bird.
[192:15.09]But I think those kind of things are when you're at your... At least for me, they'd have to be at my, like, forever home.
[192:27.52]So.
[192:28.62]And by forever home, I mean at least a house that I know I'd be at at least for at least 10 years.
[192:39.64]So, maybe.
[192:41.79]I do love rats though.
[192:43.26]They are awesome.
[192:47.10]Thank you, Step and Ma, for the $5.
[192:52.08]Hey, Jerma.
[192:52.90]Long time watcher, first time donator.
[192:54.30]Been really enjoying your streams and second Jerma videos.
[192:57.00]I want to make some videos, though one of my ideas needs audio where you ask a doctor and a priest to drill your head for $50.
[193:03.99]I can't remember which stream or era, pre-Vegas or Vegas.
[193:09.65]Can you or chat remember when you made that joke you had headaches during them?
[193:17.00]I don't, I have no idea.
[193:22.84]Audio where you ask a doctor and priest to drill your head for $50.
[193:27.22]It was during the Demon's Souls streams.
[193:32.14]Demon's Souls Part 2, apparently.
[193:40.92]Hopefully, maybe somebody can help you out.
[193:42.20]I really don't remember.
[193:45.70]I say a lot of things.
[193:47.82]Sometimes I don't even have any... any memory at all of ever saying anything.
[193:54.66]Somebody will tell me... I got shot a clip before, and I was talking about like peeing in my face or something.
[193:59.56]And it was me saying it on camera, and I just... I was like, when the fuck did I do that?
[194:08.32]I think that's kind of just what happens when... So I've been doing this for eight years, right?
[194:13.85]I've been recorded...
[194:16.25]talking and saying random stuff and talking to you guys for almost a decade.
[194:24.75]So, yeah, there's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hours, hundreds, thousands of hours of me talking, so sometimes it's hard to remember.
[194:38.75]The Alzheimer's is kicking in.
[194:44.32]But I hope you find it.
[194:46.22]Whatever you're going to do with it.
[194:48.96]Just keep it classy.
[194:50.36]Make it classy, okay?
[194:52.72]But thank you for the $5.
[194:54.68]AdventureMFDan, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[194:56.40]PhylactorLich gave 69 community subs.
[194:59.85]Hundreds of subs from this person, if you don't know.
[195:03.09]Hundreds.
[195:07.69]AdventureMFDan, 15 total community subs tonight as well.
[195:11.39]Actually, I think more than that, too.
[195:15.58]I know that might be from the other day.
[195:18.26]But thanks, seriously.
[195:22.37]Thank you, guys.
[195:24.61]Some people give an just insane amount of money to the stream.
[195:29.85]I just hope that you can afford it, number one.
[195:32.93]And number two, I am floored that you would even think to give me any money that is even remotely, remotely even countable.
[195:45.86]Sometimes I look at the amount of money that people give to this stream and it's just like, holy shit, that's a lot of fucking money.
[195:53.56]So please, if you do donate to this stream, if you do sub to this channel, make sure that you are capable of doing that completely.
[196:06.25]I should be way down on your priority list.
[196:13.50]I appreciate it nonetheless.
[196:15.04]Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[196:20.83]Speaking of subs, there are at least 100 gifted subs today.
[196:28.09]Let's take a look at all the subs today.
[196:34.72]Thank you.
[196:37.82]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[196:43.98]I will have, by then, so tonight into tomorrow, because I won't be around until Tuesday, I'm going to get some real, this coming week here, probably, I'm not going to give you a date yet.
[196:57.79]On Tuesday, I will give you a real, true date for a cutoff for submissions for the activity book stream, and then a date for that as well.
[197:07.44]It'll probably end up being this coming weekend.
[197:11.40]So the cutoff, I'm just going to say it right now.
[197:13.24]Here it is.
[197:14.60]This is, it has to be this way because obviously the carnival stream is two weeks from now.
[197:20.57]So what is with this spam?
[197:22.87]What's going on with the spam in this chat room?
[197:26.29]What's happening with the spam in this room?
[197:31.08]in my face do it piss on me piss it piss in my face do it I'm fine I can hold my breath the second I start to smell some feet I can just point who knows if I've ever said that before I don't know um but on Tuesday I will give you guys real dates for this stuff besides obviously you know the carnival stream is the 21st the activity book stream will be that same week
[198:02.28]It will end up being somewhere in the middle of the week or the first, the early week of that, the week of the 16th.
[198:10.08]So we're gonna get two... You'll get two pretty much back-to-back streams.
[198:15.20]That, uh... Might be pretty interesting.
[198:17.76]Well, the one on the 21st is guaranteed to be, so... When's the deadline?
[198:22.84]The deadline will end up being...
[198:26.06]Probably this weekend.
[198:26.92]Probably, like, not this weekend, but next weekend.
[198:29.34]So either the 13th or the 14th will be the true hard deadline for any activity book submissions.
[198:36.15]And then, after a few days, we'll compile some stuff, I'll get some stuff ready, and then probably, like, the... I want to say the 16th, the 17th, or the 18th.
[198:45.31]Or maybe even the 19th.
[198:46.27]No, no, no, no, no.
[198:50.41]It'll have to be, like, the 16th, because I'm going to be gone.
[198:53.46]So it'll be either the 15th, 16th, or 17th.
[198:55.87]I'll give you a hard date, don't worry, you'll know at least a week in advance.
[199:00.23]This is the Where's Waldo thing, yeah.
[199:01.61]And the dot-to-dot, and random little jokes and shit.
[199:04.26]It's just a thing for fun.
[199:05.52]Just a little community night where people submitted stuff.
[199:09.00]And I do little puzzles on stream, and little activity book stuff that the community has made.
[199:18.29]The Where's Waldo segment, if you don't know what that means, people have to make an image where I have to find me in the image.
[199:30.50]Where's Waldo style.
[199:34.06]And the only thing I get to do is I have to sit, I will have a webcam on, I will have to sit at least two feet away from the monitor, but I get to use the Windows magnifying glass.
[199:47.98]That's a stipulation that I get to have.
[199:49.30]No, I'm two feet away from the monitor.
[199:58.05]Windows magnifying glass.
[200:08.27]Where's Baldo?
[200:12.13]But thank you Apple shit for the 250.
[200:15.26]Hey, who was your hero and idol growing up?
[200:20.72]Jim Carrey.
[200:24.06]Jerry Lewis, believe it or not.
[200:30.17]And probably a few voice actors.
[200:32.53]There's a ton of them that I could list.
[200:36.41]People like Charlie Adler, Tom Kenny.
[200:48.41]Definitely.
[200:52.75]If you want, if you want, seriously, if you want to know the, the, the person that made me want to do, like, voices and characters of, uh, it's Charlie Adler.
[201:03.98]It's, if you look up to, you'll know who he is.
[201:09.18]Cow and Chicken, the big heads from Rocko.
[201:17.52]He's everywhere.
[201:19.06]At least he used to be.
[201:23.53]If you don't like, add Big Head.
[201:24.77]Oh, it's me, Big Head!
[201:28.09]Oh, Rocko!
[201:29.23]I... He was incredibly animated, incredibly... His range could go up and down.
[201:34.87]He was, it was wonderful.
[201:38.48]That's like my biggest, probably my biggest like actual inspiration.
[201:48.35]At least in... I don't know, if you want to use the words... Who did you want to emulate when you were watching cartoons and TV shows?
[201:55.92]It would be him.
[202:08.27]But... Hopefully that answers your question.
[202:12.77]And then finally, permanent marks thanks for three bucks.
[202:23.95]No message, just $3 from Permanent Marks.
[202:25.59]Thank you.
[202:28.27]Take it easy, guys.
[202:29.82]I will see all you wonderful people on Tuesday.
[202:34.94]Good night.
[202:35.80]Take care.
[202:36.54]Thanks for joining me as always.
[202:37.44]See you soon.
[202:41.55]Goodbye.
[202:47.51]Wait, hold on, wait, no, no, no, no, not yet, not yet.
[202:50.45]I missed one that just came in a few minutes ago.
[202:52.47]Tyler Mike, thanks for the $2.50.
[202:53.61]We made a joke about that earlier.
[203:10.15]And I didn't realize... So I... It's a long time.
[203:16.57]To go from, like, 1... Even from, like, 1 to 20 in Classic WoW is a long-ass time.
[203:23.65]And I'm not sure I can, like, put the necessary time into doing that.
[203:32.23]It's an interesting thing that I want to do, but I don't, like, have time to do it right now.
[203:39.87]Maybe when all the dust settles.
[203:48.39]I just don't... I don't... I don't have, like, really the time to play WoW right now.
[203:52.84]And I thought I was going to, but then that was also before some of these big streams came up.
[203:58.68]Do you remember a lot about Classic WoW?
[204:01.80]Yep, I do.
[204:06.32]Sorry for adding you on Xbox.
[204:07.68]Please don't delete your account.
[204:09.24]I'm not gonna.
[204:12.14]I just hit 20 the other day and I had like 24 hours played.
[204:15.67]Yeah.
[204:17.49]So it's a commitment.
[204:18.55]Especially if you want to do anything that's, you know, not picking up squirrel blood.
[204:26.86]Border Alliance?
[204:27.70]I always played Alliance.
[204:32.34]And that really only is because I liked the way that the humans left.
[204:37.17]The human laugh was, like, the biggest dick move.
[204:43.09]If, you know, if you ganked somebody or, like, you got in a fight with a horde and it was... You could just sit there.
[204:47.43]You just typed slash LOL when they died.
[204:49.82]It was just like that motherfucker.
[205:00.92]Nobody had a laugh like the human.
[205:08.83]alliance ganking omega low oh the gnome too the gnome laugh I based who I played on is how their laugh was the gnome that like it's like you nobody can do it you can't replicate it
[205:37.98]But maybe, I don't know, I can't say definitively if I'm gonna do that.
[205:42.29]If I really get into it and I really actually start playing... What I'm... I gotta be careful, though, because... Oh, I'm gonna start playing Classic WoW!
[205:52.29]I'm gonna... Level 20!
[205:55.11]No, level 25.
[205:56.05]I love this.
[205:57.69]I remember how fun this was.
[205:59.49]I'm gonna do this every day.
[206:00.37]What are you streaming tomorrow?
[206:02.62]Uh, I'm not... I'm nothing.
[206:04.74]Oh, when are you gonna stream again?
[206:06.64]Uh, Tuesday.
[206:08.91]Okay, it's Tuesday now.
[206:12.01]Yeah.
[206:12.98]You mean this next Tuesday?
[206:15.54]Yeah, I think.
[206:20.42]You guys want to see WoW?
[206:23.43]I don't want to do that.
[206:25.77]I'll get sucked in.
[206:33.97]But thank you, apkey, or appkey for the three bucks.
[206:39.62]What's your favorite PowerShell?
[206:43.44]What's my favorite command?
[206:49.08]I don't know.
[206:51.84]ipconfig slash all.
[206:55.55]I don't know.
[207:00.95]Or traceroute to, I don't know.
[207:13.67]Alright, I'm out of here.
[207:14.47]See you guys on Tuesday.
[207:15.75]Take care.
[207:16.23]Good night.
[207:19.79]Have a wonderful rest of your evening.
[207:21.65]And a wonderful rest of your next few days.
[207:22.97]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[207:25.54]Goodbye.
[207:26.90]See you.
[207:28.50]Take care.
[207:52.79]Nucky Grandma!
