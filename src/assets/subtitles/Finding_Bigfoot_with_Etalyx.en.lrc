[01:11.62]Hey.
[01:13.22]Hey.
[01:15.44]Hey.
[01:16.38]See?
[01:17.16]I got my keys.
[01:20.08]That means I'm early.
[01:21.78]By two minutes.
[01:24.50]That's what it means.
[01:25.02]Yeah, we're going to be playing some stuff tonight.
[01:31.17]And by stuff I mean me and Etalyx.
[01:33.49]We're going to do some co-op fun friend time.
[01:36.13]You know?
[01:44.79]Ice cold water.
[01:48.57]Clown car keys?
[01:50.40]Ow.
[01:51.56]Yeah.
[01:54.42]Now we're late?
[01:55.00]No, we're not.
[01:56.66]It's 7 o'clock right now.
[01:59.94]At this very second, it is 7 p.m.
[02:04.18]I don't know what you guys are on about right now.
[02:07.32]But, you know what I mean?
[02:11.47]Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma.
[02:13.35]No Breath of the Wild?
[02:14.29]No.
[02:15.27]No, not me.
[02:18.71]Not me.
[02:21.19]Oh boy, right off the bat.
[02:23.14]I'll explain why in a second, but... We got a big drop of money here.
[02:30.83]And that is from, uh, Saika.
[02:34.56]Saika Blat.
[02:35.68]Saika, I'm never going to get your name right, but... $50 from Saika.
[02:41.26]Where they say, Hey, since the main channel is now for big projects and mackerel handles the second channel, does that mean that the casual stuff you used to do on the main channel will stop entirely?
[02:51.91]Uh, no.
[02:53.37]Either way, I love what you do and just want you to know that I've been here for years.
[02:56.29]We all truly love you.
[02:57.09]Well, thank you, dude.
[02:58.63]Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[03:00.23]And that obviously deserves a response.
[03:02.62]And not like, um... I would ever stop doing the things you're describing.
[03:07.06]No.
[03:08.20]The, uh... The way that that's gonna work is... Streaming has kind of become...
[03:18.22]the second channel.
[03:19.28]Like, the streaming is the second channel's content, right?
[03:23.33]And the stuff that's on that second channel is videos I would have made if I had just not streamed these games.
[03:29.09]So, for instance, like, I played Manowar last night.
[03:33.59]Manowar last night, I would have played that game off-stream and made a video on it, right?
[03:39.84]So, it's kind of... There's no real...
[03:48.26]There's no real, oh, those old gaming videos are gone forever.
[03:53.18]No.
[03:53.88]Like, they're just turning into something else.
[03:55.60]They turned into this.
[03:58.62]Which is, like, the second channel in the streams.
[04:00.60]Does that make any sense?
[04:05.36]Sorry, I was, like, trying to pay attention to two things at the same time.
[04:08.48]But hopefully that, like, makes sense.
[04:10.60]That the videos that you're seeing on the second channel are kind of like what I would have done anyways, but I'm streaming the games I would have recorded.
[04:17.16]Right?
[04:18.71]Anyways, Etalyx is moving around in here.
[04:20.11]I gotta move in here.
[04:22.25]Thanks a lot, by the way.
[04:23.29]Appreciate it.
[04:23.81]Etalyx is waiting for me.
[04:25.19]Let me get over there.
[04:29.38]I'm here.
[04:30.34]I'm sorry.
[04:32.20]Just call me Bad Friend McGee.
[04:35.12]Hey, Fred.
[04:35.62]How's it going?
[04:36.38]Bad Fred McGee.
[04:38.23]Everyone says hi, Fred.
[04:39.83]Oh, hi.
[04:40.89]Everyone say hi to Etalyx.
[04:43.72]Etalyx is a really good dude.
[04:44.64]You can't really see him.
[04:45.26]He's kind of blurry right now.
[04:50.13]Hold on.
[04:50.55]Give me one second.
[04:53.33]I just want to get this lowered because it's kind of in the way.
[04:57.13]It's really in the way.
[04:58.89]Come on.
[04:59.71]I can't see anything.
[05:03.34]Aye, aye, aye, man.
[05:04.86]I got a real aye, aye, aye situation here, Etalyx.
[05:10.20]There we go.
[05:10.66]Okay.
[05:12.73]I am ready to receive Etalyx.
[05:17.51]Alright.
[05:18.47]I'm ready to receive you Etalyx in our friend time.
[05:24.17]I've been told that you are so... Hold on.
[05:26.67]I'm loud?
[05:28.73]Hold on.
[05:29.15]Just on my end.
[05:30.11]Oh, gosh darn it.
[05:32.69]Windows 7?
[05:33.23]Yeah, I use Windows 7.
[05:36.39]I think that'll do it.
[05:37.73]Are we ready to, as the main tasks suggest, um, these are very important instructions over here by the way.
[05:45.01]Wait, wait, wait, we didn't even start yet!
[05:47.65]We didn't even start!
[05:49.01]Bigfoot's already in the fucking cabin!
[05:51.52]Bigfoot's already in the cabin!
[05:52.72]We didn't even do anything!
[05:54.28]We didn't even get a chance to introduce the game!
[05:57.40]Close the window!
[05:58.58]He made... Did I open that window?
[06:03.15]I might have opened that window.
[06:04.75]Wait, wait a second.
[06:06.03]Why was it like a tiger?
[06:07.95]Wait.
[06:12.78]I'm going to investigate.
[06:14.88]See if he's still there.
[06:17.06]Wait, it's probably a bad idea.
[06:18.30]Do we need any medicine?
[06:20.38]We got a lot of supplies in here that we need to take.
[06:23.04]If he's right here, this is a bad idea, isn't it?
[06:25.14]I thought, aren't we supposed to track him down?
[06:29.10]Yeah, he tracked us down because we took too long.
[06:32.10]Apparently.
[06:33.60]If you just idle inside for too long.
[06:35.61]Wait, wait.
[06:36.11]Take the rope.
[06:39.09]Take the signal gun.
[06:40.83]Take some bullets.
[06:41.77]Are you still alive?
[06:46.35]I'm still alive.
[06:47.04]Barely.
[06:47.86]He took off like a third of my life right there.
[06:50.26]Well, you're using a little bit of medicine.
[06:52.71]Where's the medicine?
[06:53.73]All I see is bullets.
[06:57.29]And a rope.
[06:59.03]Let's very slowly introduce what's going on here.
[07:01.41]Oh, you got a gun?
[07:02.29]Yeah, I got a gun.
[07:04.48]Okay.
[07:04.84]Don't worry, we didn't need that to drive Bigfoot back home.
[07:10.16]I can't even hear what you say.
[07:13.32]You set the car on fire.
[07:15.34]I did?
[07:15.70]Hold on, we have to get Bigfoot in this cage?
[07:20.01]Hold on.
[07:21.58]Do you hear that?
[07:22.89]I did hear that.
[07:23.55]Hold on, I gotta get the gun ready.
[07:26.19]Oh, jeez.
[07:26.97]And there's lightning and thunder outside, too.
[07:29.61]This is just a signal flare.
[07:31.59]Oh, I thought it was like a flame.
[07:34.03]So, if we get separated in the woods, then we can just shoot the flare up and find each other like this.
[07:40.22]Oh, alright.
[07:42.08]That makes sense.
[07:43.10]That is so big and so loud.
[07:44.54]Okay.
[07:45.52]So, guys, you want to explain what's going on in Talak's...
[07:49.62]Uh, I know about as much as you do, but we found ourselves here in the middle of the forest.
[07:53.97]You know, we've, we've been searching for, we've got a healthy interest in conspiracy theories, you know?
[08:00.11]So, how many of those do you have?
[08:11.65]And you're just, like, suing them without even realizing it?
[08:13.76]Where is he?
[08:14.40]Where is he?
[08:14.64]Where is he?
[08:18.23]I don't know, but I hear a roaring.
[08:21.65]He'll be able to find us real nice and easily now.
[08:32.40]We're here, Bigfoot.
[08:34.40]Just look for the orange glove.
[08:40.71]This is a J.J.
[08:41.91]Abrams movie?
[08:42.64]There's so much flair!
[08:44.18]By the way, why is Bigfoot the MGM lion?
[08:48.66]I don't know.
[08:51.98]Okay, so there's a real gun in here.
[08:54.25]Yeah, is there a real gun in there?
[08:57.23]You're gonna tell me there's a real gun?
[08:58.97]I think I just picked it up.
[09:00.19]I don't know where it went.
[09:00.97]Oh, you do have it.
[09:01.47]It's on your back.
[09:02.99]Can you, like, take that out and start shooting?
[09:06.56]I don't know my... There's another one back here.
[09:08.20]You figure it out.
[09:08.98]Seriously?
[09:10.16]Nice.
[09:10.46]Okay.
[09:11.20]Okay.
[09:11.82]How'd you do that?
[09:14.24]There's no bullets.
[09:14.98]There's traps.
[09:15.92]I heard that there's no bullets.
[09:17.27]I heard all the clicks.
[09:18.49]Take the night vision batteries.
[09:20.05]Take the medicine.
[09:22.49]I think that's good, right?
[09:24.79]This is where we get situated.
[09:26.19]Take camera.
[09:26.77]Okay, I have four cameras.
[09:28.95]Controls.
[09:33.63]Okay, what do we do with the camera?
[09:35.83]Oh, this is where we track him.
[09:40.24]Alright, see, I got a camera pointing this way, right?
[09:43.54]What's happening to me?
[09:46.34]You just trapped me.
[09:48.24]You just put me in a trap.
[09:49.38]Okay.
[09:50.44]I got out.
[09:50.86]I apparently got out of that trap.
[09:53.12]This trap sucks.
[09:54.30]Okay, I'm picking it back up.
[09:56.70]Let's go with like 32%, like 35%.
[09:58.25]How do you get your gun out?
[10:00.01]I don't understand.
[10:01.20]Uh, two.
[10:02.76]Jesus.
[10:03.00]Oh, okay.
[10:04.34]That hurts.
[10:05.78]Hold on.
[10:06.42]I think we're forgetting something.
[10:07.66]Yeah, ammo.
[10:08.98]Yeah, pretty important.
[10:12.50]That's very important, actually.
[10:14.94]Do we have any ammo?
[10:16.81]That was good.
[10:17.37]It's a good reload animation.
[10:18.91]Pretty solid.
[10:19.53]Give me one sec.
[10:23.51]Oh!
[10:24.75]What happened?
[10:26.17]That is lethal!
[10:27.75]There he is!
[10:28.13]There's Bigfoot!
[10:28.69]Bigfoot's coming!
[10:29.67]Watch out!
[10:30.29]Watch out!
[10:30.75]He's right behind you!
[10:32.63]He's on the other side of the ice cream truck.
[10:35.65]How did he get away so fast?
[10:37.39]I don't know.
[10:38.61]He's gone.
[10:41.01]He's there and then he's gone.
[10:42.19]Like a flash of lightning.
[10:45.66]Do you come back?
[10:47.34]Do I come back?
[10:48.46]Is this what is it?
[10:49.20]Permadeath?
[10:51.64]Is this the new roguelite?
[10:53.12]I love how Bigfoot's not even the real threat here.
[10:55.36]It's like you and me.
[10:56.10]I thought Bigfoot shot me.
[10:58.79]Oh, this is a legit shotgun.
[11:00.05]It's got some spread on it.
[11:02.15]Shot by Bigfoot.
[11:06.42]Can you come back to life?
[11:09.66]Do it again.
[11:12.93]Hold on, reloading.
[11:13.75]Shoot me again.
[11:16.63]I'm still making noise.
[11:18.95]You keep killing me over and over again, and my guy still hurts.
[11:21.19]Do you want to keep the defibs or something?
[11:22.96]Do we have that?
[11:23.76]I don't even think that exists.
[11:25.30]I think I just have to leave the game or you have to die.
[11:27.40]Hold on.
[11:28.94]Is there like a grenade?
[11:30.40]Can I step in my own traps?
[11:32.72]My body disappeared.
[11:35.54]Is my body still there?
[11:36.84]He's still there for me.
[11:37.66]Dude, I can't wait until you get fucking tackled by Bigfoot.
[11:45.43]He's gonna come out of the woods.
[11:46.37]He's taking his deer sweet.
[11:47.55]I'm just trying to... I'm just doing death by trap right now.
[11:53.12]You know, you just surround yourself in traps.
[11:55.68]So eventually he's gonna sprint at you and he'll get caught and you can shot him.
[11:58.26]You can shoot...
[12:02.51]This task is too difficult for you.
[12:09.25]Press enter.
[12:10.27]Oh, we got to start over.
[12:11.79]We have to do it again.
[12:13.63]Alright, hold on, hold on.
[12:15.11]Hold on.
[12:16.13]I'll make the game up.
[12:17.37]Hold on.
[12:17.99]Wow, alright.
[12:20.44]Okay, well, that's one way to start.
[12:23.12]Same deal.
[12:23.82]Same exact name, same everything.
[12:26.00]You remember what it was?
[12:27.84]Yeah.
[12:29.20]Okay, hold on.
[12:32.05]This task is too difficult.
[12:36.94]They're not asking much of us.
[12:38.26]They just want us to catch Bigfoot.
[12:40.24]That's all.
[12:41.84]Give me one second, though.
[12:42.96]I do want to say something.
[12:45.80]Nairomi gave 50 bucks a few minutes ago.
[12:49.35]Clean your house, do your laundry, and throw away the spoiled cucumber in the fridge.
[12:52.77]There's no spoiled cucumber in my fridge.
[12:54.67]We bought that like three days ago.
[12:56.27]It is still delicious.
[12:57.31]It's still good, but thank you for the 5,000 bits.
[12:59.69]Much appreciated.
[13:00.99]Scoop, thank you for the $15.
[13:02.13]Jermaine, thank you very much, Scoop.
[13:04.50]That's very appreciative of you.
[13:07.24]Much love, guys.
[13:07.82]Thank you so much.
[13:08.34]Wait, what?
[13:09.96]Alright.
[13:10.68]Alright.
[13:11.24]I'm ready.
[13:12.86]So I'm going to be me this time.
[13:22.34]You were just two different people.
[13:25.46]I don't know how that happened.
[13:28.02]You were one person and then you just turned to another.
[13:33.26]Can we have daytime?
[13:34.16]Am I muted still?
[13:37.25]Can you hear me?
[13:40.05]Am I muted?
[13:40.63]Yeah, I was muted.
[13:42.71]You were not muted.
[13:43.79]I'm pretty sure that I'm this guy.
[13:45.17]Was he modeled after me?
[13:47.59]This guy right here.
[13:49.45]I think that's me.
[13:51.59]One of these guys looks like me, too.
[13:54.02]I was just going to shoot you right in the face.
[13:56.40]Seriously, I was like, no, I can't do that.
[13:58.00]We've got to at least try to catch Bigfoot.
[14:00.42]You're going to do it eventually.
[14:01.88]You may as well get it out of the way.
[14:03.96]No, I can't.
[14:05.42]What's in the fridge?
[14:05.84]It's going to be when I least expect it.
[14:07.74]What's in here?
[14:08.06]Bologna?
[14:09.64]Oh, okay, so we take the meat, we put the meat on the traps, right?
[14:13.36]Ooh, you can bait Bigfoot.
[14:15.14]I'm assuming, yeah.
[14:15.86]Okay.
[14:17.94]I'm gonna set up some cameras.
[14:19.46]Hold on, stay in here, real quick.
[14:20.60]Yeah, we don't need the flashlight right now.
[14:21.80]Okay, you be camera guy, I'm gonna be... Okay, so stand here at the command station.
[14:27.70]Okay, this is command center.
[14:28.94]No, over here.
[14:29.78]Over here.
[14:30.26]Alright, you got it.
[14:32.64]Oh, am I gonna be able to see this shit?
[14:34.44]Yeah.
[14:35.26]Oh, that'd be so cool.
[14:35.82]Alright, hold on.
[14:37.20]I'm gonna put them, like, away from the... Should I put them facing away from the RV or towards the RV?
[14:41.23]Because it keeps showing up at the RV.
[14:44.13]Um, I would... I would move it away.
[14:45.48]By the way, there are, like, survivors we have to find.
[14:47.14]There's people lost in the woods somewhere.
[14:52.30]now I can see these cameras this game just got way cooler alright let me see what it looks like it's pretty cool four cameras out you only see one another four alright do you see me on those cameras I only see one camera like my cameras are all jacked up can you see me no I only see one out of four cameras oh wait they're coming online now
[15:15.73]So they're online for you now.
[15:17.25]Two of them.
[15:18.35]Where did you place them?
[15:19.71]They're like right around the RV.
[15:21.11]They're just pointing away from the RV.
[15:26.40]Well, let's check it out.
[15:28.60]I'm waiting.
[15:29.56]Stand out in front of one of them.
[15:30.66]Oh, there we are.
[15:31.22]Can you see me?
[15:33.64]I think they have like a delayed feed.
[15:38.57]No, I don't see you.
[15:39.31]Oh, you don't see me?
[15:40.25]Come on.
[15:40.81]That's such bullshit.
[15:42.01]Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
[15:42.81]Wait, there he is.
[15:44.31]Wait, there he is.
[15:44.93]So you can see... Dude, this is so dumb.
[15:47.61]I'm, like, turning the whole camera around.
[15:49.38]I see that, yeah.
[15:50.18]You can, like, actually move them.
[15:52.30]I'm, like, zooming in on you right now.
[15:53.98]Getting a nice little... Face full of lead, I guess.
[15:59.54]Alright, yeah, I got some cameras, too.
[16:02.05]Okay.
[16:02.65]Put them in strategic locations.
[16:04.50]You get your gun, and we're going to find the tourists.
[16:06.86]Alright, I got the gun.
[16:07.94]We're going to Glacier Lake.
[16:09.58]Got the ammo.
[16:10.06]You got ammo?
[16:10.76]You got health?
[16:12.56]Got some batteries.
[16:13.64]Don't know what they're for.
[16:14.58]I don't have any flares or anything, but that's okay.
[16:16.26]We can deal with that later.
[16:19.36]Let's go to Glacier Lake and go track Bigfoot down.
[16:22.30]Look, Bigfoot may be Bigfoot, but we have shotguns.
[16:26.95]Do you seriously think he's going to be able to take us on?
[16:29.41]Okay.
[16:30.77]I feel like the answer to that question is absolutely.
[16:34.01]Right.
[16:35.65]Otherwise this game would be 15 minutes long.
[16:39.53]What if we just shoot him once and he dies?
[16:42.33]Like that's all you had to do.
[16:43.66]I feel like he only comes out at night.
[16:46.30]I got three traps.
[16:47.28]So you have, okay.
[16:48.06]And a little bit of meat.
[16:49.70]So I'm going to put that onto you.
[16:52.10]Oh, hit Q. Hit Q.
[16:56.22]Ah, okay.
[16:57.50]That's helpful.
[16:57.82]There's like a couple points of interest.
[16:59.29]There's like two bridges and there's like a creek to the north.
[17:03.20]Yeah, let's head to the creek.
[17:04.32]Let's go to the creek.
[17:08.83]Alright, we're going out.
[17:09.81]Heading out.
[17:10.77]So, yeah, we aren't technically finding Bigfoot as much as we are murdering Bigfoot.
[17:15.43]R.I.P.
[17:16.15]Branch.
[17:16.43]We're supposed to capture him.
[17:18.81]R.I.P.
[17:19.13]Branch, you know what I mean?
[17:19.81]They could die when I pick them.
[17:21.97]I've got rope, presumably, to tie up Bigfoot.
[17:26.17]How are we going to tie up Bigfoot?
[17:27.59]I don't understand that.
[17:30.85]Should I just be dead?
[17:31.49]I don't know.
[17:33.25]I see you've got rope.
[17:35.03]I do have rope.
[17:36.17]You've got a rope on you.
[17:37.35]This is meat.
[17:38.33]Yeah, that's meat.
[17:39.29]I push the exact same button.
[17:41.15]Okay.
[17:42.89]Well, let's put a trap down.
[17:45.14]No, don't light the forest on fire.
[17:49.54]Hold on, watch me.
[17:53.04]You really run around like a dickhead with that out, huh?
[17:59.78]Yeah, you run around like a real idiot with that thing up.
[18:01.90]Okay, you do it.
[18:02.60]I want to see.
[18:04.54]I've got my school lunch.
[18:06.36]What?
[18:12.20]Just keep your hands at your knees.
[18:13.92]I know.
[18:15.16]It's like the weed ninja run almost.
[18:17.66]Alright, here we are.
[18:20.28]We made it to the creek.
[18:23.61]I'm putting meat down for my friend.
[18:24.87]Alright, you put a trap down there.
[18:27.77]And then we gotta hide.
[18:28.51]We gotta hide in the brush.
[18:30.67]So we get a trap there.
[18:32.22]Okay.
[18:32.88]Meat?
[18:33.38]Yeah.
[18:33.88]See, I got this meat right here.
[18:35.38]There's like two pieces of meat.
[18:37.26]He cannot resist the lung meat.
[18:38.90]Alright, let's go over here.
[18:41.43]I'm like, what's crouch?
[18:42.67]I got two traps.
[18:43.99]Okay, good.
[18:44.55]Alright.
[18:45.75]Right here.
[18:47.17]Is there a crouch button?
[18:47.91]Put a camera right there, too.
[18:48.65]That's actually a good idea.
[18:51.86]Yeah.
[18:52.48]Because I bet he won't come while we're, like, standing close to him.
[18:55.18]No, maybe not.
[18:57.83]What is this, like a cover?
[19:00.29]So do we see on the mini-map?
[19:01.37]Okay, we can see on the mini-map where that is, right?
[19:03.34]Yeah, see five.
[19:04.16]Yeah, it has five on it.
[19:05.60]So we know to switch to camera five to see there.
[19:08.36]Yep.
[19:08.86]Oh, what's that?
[19:09.90]Pretty cool.
[19:10.52]There's a whole settlement up here.
[19:12.88]Ooh, that's like a... What the fuck?
[19:18.32]What was that?
[19:20.39]The tree's on fire.
[19:21.59]Did you do that?
[19:23.39]No.
[19:23.65]My ears.
[19:25.01]My ears.
[19:26.72]Why?
[19:28.52]Why?
[19:32.62]Somebody just... Rip your drums, I guess.
[19:39.70]Why?
[19:40.72]What's the point of that?
[19:43.63]Ow.
[19:48.41]Where is he?
[19:49.37]He's back to the right.
[19:50.51]He's this way.
[19:51.05]The way I'm facing.
[19:51.75]Is he...
[19:53.96]Yeah, he's gotta be.
[19:54.64]That's where the sound came from.
[19:55.98]Dude, does Bigfoot have magical powers?
[19:58.14]Did Bigfoot do that?
[20:01.07]Did he?
[20:01.39]I have no idea.
[20:02.73]But that was the loudest sound I've ever heard in a video game.
[20:06.39]And I think it gave me a headache.
[20:10.00]This is turned down to 30%.
[20:10.78]Alright, let's get in this log cabin.
[20:20.04]How do I get in?
[20:21.56]There's probably a door.
[20:24.10]Right here.
[20:26.54]Lantern?
[20:27.04]There is a trap in here, so there's extra supplies.
[20:29.79]There's another rifle.
[20:32.75]Nice, alright.
[20:35.91]Probably for a third player, if I had to guess.
[20:38.95]It is up to three players, that would be a thing.
[20:41.33]Alright, what about the lookout tower?
[20:42.33]Anything in here?
[20:42.77]This is like a good shooting position.
[20:47.37]Yeah, take ammo.
[20:48.13]No, you take the ammo, I have a lot.
[20:52.93]Okay, I gotta go to the lookout position here.
[20:54.25]Okay.
[20:56.19]So you want me to go be the bait?
[20:58.55]Um... Just run around with, like, some meat?
[21:00.75]Let's see, where are we right now?
[21:02.27]Okay, there's that.
[21:03.17]This is a big map.
[21:06.15]Not bad, yeah.
[21:06.77]I think the mountains are probably out of bounds, I would guess.
[21:10.04]What is this?
[21:10.64]Hold on, I see a skull.
[21:11.80]There's a dead person here.
[21:14.10]You found a body?
[21:14.76]Is it one of the survivors?
[21:15.80]I don't know.
[21:17.68]But this guy is very truly dead.
[21:21.78]Ooh.
[21:24.26]Ooh.
[21:25.10]Okay.
[21:27.38]Just to make sure he's not suffering.
[21:29.14]No, just to make sure he's not a zombie.
[21:32.38]Who knows with this game?
[21:33.32]Alright, so we found one of the survivors.
[21:35.36]Okay, so we know he's been here possibly recently.
[21:38.60]Yep.
[21:39.20]I think he was here recently if I would guess.
[21:42.40]Okay.
[21:45.49]How do you use binoculars?
[21:47.47]Survivor is dead.
[21:48.63]And what is this knife thing?
[21:50.75]There's a finding Bigfoot guide if you hit G. G. Oh.
[21:56.30]I love these images.
[22:01.14]Okay.
[22:03.94]Oh, apparently they do have supernatural abilities.
[22:10.28]Okay, they have a smell.
[22:10.90]When hunters are born, they from birth to develop their skills.
[22:15.33]Alright, hey, this thing said that he can smell injured people, and that we're more inclined to find him if somebody was injured, so... Did that hurt you?
[22:28.38]Did you hit me?
[22:29.04]Because it did not hurt me.
[22:30.20]Apparently that didn't hurt you.
[22:32.46]I'm Bigfoot.
[22:33.52]Where can you get shot with a shotgun that doesn't kill you?
[22:36.10]Like, in the stomach?
[22:37.78]Alright, I'm in deep shit, so...
[22:42.23]Hopefully Bigfoot spells me now.
[22:45.64]If somebody falls down in front of me, I'll die.
[22:50.88]I'm bleeding right now.
[22:53.06]I have a med kit.
[22:55.04]Do you need one?
[22:55.70]I got one too.
[22:58.46]You tell me when you find him.
[22:59.48]Once he picks up the scent of the blood.
[23:04.03]Then I'm going to use the health kit.
[23:07.67]What terrible hunters, by the way.
[23:11.65]You're like in a beanie and some Converse sneakers.
[23:15.73]Just trudging through the swamp.
[23:17.48]I'm referring to, hey, let's go hunt Bigfoot.
[23:19.90]I'm going to shoot my other hunter in the stomach to get him to come out.
[23:25.06]Oh, I see movement.
[23:26.82]It could be an animal.
[23:27.88]It could be an animal.
[23:29.29]This way.
[23:30.05]Where is it?
[23:30.37]I don't know.
[23:32.53]I just saw movement.
[23:34.23]Make sure you're all healed up.
[23:36.95]Make sure you sprint directly at whatever it is.
[23:39.33]That's how you do it.
[23:42.96]This is so slow to get through the water.
[23:44.76]Yeah, remember, we're looking for Bigfoot.
[23:49.02]Keep your eyes peeled.
[23:50.44]Where was the movement?
[23:51.70]Over this way, like 12 o'clock.
[23:54.20]12 o'clock, you got it.
[24:00.16]Somewhere back in these trees.
[24:05.80]Alright.
[24:06.62]I 100% saw something move.
[24:10.87]Well, I can hear something.
[24:13.51]Do you hear that?
[24:13.93]Sounds like an owl.
[24:14.67]I hear a hoot.
[24:17.71]I hear a frog.
[24:19.88]My favorite animal.
[24:20.70]Alright, hold on.
[24:21.08]Where are we?
[24:22.44]Let's go to the mountains.
[24:23.14]To the left.
[24:25.23]I want to find what was moving, but it's... I think I lost you.
[24:29.44]Uh-oh, you lost me?
[24:30.72]Don't worry.
[24:33.00]I think you found me.
[24:35.62]So bright.
[24:36.86]Okay, why do you rip branches?
[24:38.22]Is it so you don't get lost?
[24:40.30]I don't know.
[24:40.94]Who knows?
[24:41.40]There's got to be a reason.
[24:44.58]I see, like, a crossroad sign to the left.
[24:48.36]I'm heading up to, like, the mountains over here.
[24:49.76]I feel like there could be some investigating we could do.
[24:55.21]I think we're separated now.
[24:56.39]Are we separated?
[24:57.73]Look up in the air.
[24:59.85]Okay, yeah, you're that way.
[25:02.11]I'm over here for reference.
[25:08.82]I found a road.
[25:10.92]We shouldn't be separating when Bigfoot is currently hunting us.
[25:15.04]And it's almost nighttime.
[25:16.45]It is almost nighttime, you're right.
[25:17.79]Can we set up like a campfire?
[25:22.48]No, but at least we got some headlamps.
[25:23.76]I brought some extra battery.
[25:24.58]Oh, yeah, you rip branches to cover the traps.
[25:27.32]I think Bigfoot's smart enough to understand.
[25:29.96]Oh, so you can't just leave it just out in the middle of nowhere and expect him to walk in it.
[25:33.92]We can't treat Bigfoot like a mouse.
[25:39.39]Okay, where am I?
[25:39.99]Alright, I'm up in the mountains.
[25:43.35]I think I went the wrong way.
[25:44.43]Oh, I'm gonna shoot a flare in the air.
[25:45.55]That's where I am, like, right there.
[25:47.85]Oh, my.
[25:48.53]You're on the other side of a lake from me.
[25:50.29]Other side of a lake?
[25:50.73]That flare is super cool, though.
[25:53.55]From a distance, it looks pretty dumb up close, but... Uh... I'll get around to you.
[26:03.37]Alright, well, I'm coming back.
[26:04.17]It's gonna take me a while.
[26:07.77]I'm actually kind of getting nervous.
[26:09.67]Yeah, I'm like southeast I Should not be going this way.
[26:14.55]Just head back to five head back to five I feel like they are closer to the camp.
[26:20.54]Are you really?
[26:22.08]How did you get that far down there?
[26:25.14]I don't know there's a lake and I kept running around the lake.
[26:28.52]What is it?
[26:29.36]Oh tracking bullets.
[26:30.08]Oh
[26:31.62]Oh, maybe if you shoot Bigfoot, then you can GPS, like, locate him when he runs away.
[26:36.68]Definitely.
[26:37.26]That's cool.
[26:42.48]Skolin.
[26:43.06]Thank you, Skolin.
[26:44.50]Skolin for the 50 bucks says, Watch your language.
[26:46.62]You've lost your clothing privileges for two weeks.
[26:49.34]What the hell does that mean?
[26:53.17]So what I saw earlier, I think, was a deer.
[26:55.81]Well, thank you for the $50.
[26:57.61]Much appreciated.
[26:58.85]Much loved, dude.
[27:01.96]Thank you so much.
[27:06.64]I'm still not sure what that means, but... Cool nonetheless.
[27:10.52]Right.
[27:10.78]Taliesin, I'm going to die out here.
[27:13.39]I'm going to get attacked by Bigfoot.
[27:15.87]No, you're not.
[27:16.45]You'll be fine.
[27:17.13]You got a gun.
[27:17.71]Just shoot it and scare him off.
[27:20.25]You think I'm going to scare Bigfoot with a gun?
[27:21.39]He's managed to evade human eyes for like hundreds of years.
[27:24.33]You think you're going to be the one that he tracks down and kills?
[27:28.46]No, it's the other guy.
[27:29.12]I just don't want to start over again.
[27:30.16]I'm, like, scared to have to start over this again if I... To be fair, we really haven't done that much.
[27:35.10]No, we really haven't.
[27:37.20]That is true.
[27:37.68]Like, we haven't done anything, really.
[27:38.84]We have not done a damn thing.
[27:40.06]You're right.
[27:40.80]We've gotten attacked by Bigfoot.
[27:42.34]Oh, God, it's getting so dark.
[27:45.48]So, there are... He's here.
[27:48.48]He's here.
[27:49.00]He's here near me.
[27:50.20]By the cabin.
[27:51.12]By the cabin with the... Okay, I'm coming up.
[27:55.84]Remember the cabin with the lantern?
[27:57.08]Yeah.
[27:58.56]Where is he?
[27:58.94]I got to check something real quick.
[28:03.09]I'm going to put a camera out here.
[28:04.35]You know what I mean?
[28:04.91]Just in case if something goes wrong, you can look at it.
[28:07.37]You can watch.
[28:08.31]No, I'm coming out.
[28:09.37]I'm in the woods.
[28:10.15]Oh, you're in the woods?
[28:10.69]Oh, God, watch out.
[28:11.19]He may be coming for you.
[28:15.62]I can hear him.
[28:19.74]So he's outside the cabin?
[28:21.36]He was just outside the cabin.
[28:22.88]There's a very loud roar.
[28:24.76]Okay.
[28:26.73]I am almost at...
[28:29.94]the trap that we set.
[28:33.14]And then I'll be able to see the cabin.
[28:36.42]I'm actually kind of scared right now.
[28:41.22]Wait, what?
[28:46.59]Well, I'm running.
[28:47.79]I'm coming towards you.
[28:48.73]Is that you?
[28:51.25]Wait, what?
[28:52.69]Is that you?
[28:53.13]I don't know who that is.
[28:59.26]Well, it has to be you or Bigfoot, because there's nobody else here.
[29:01.50]Why am I saying I don't know who that is?
[29:07.51]Where is it?
[29:08.59]Keep going straight.
[29:09.81]Oh, it's me.
[29:10.91]Oh, god damn it.
[29:12.05]I thought you were like, I was going to try to scare you.
[29:14.13]I was going to be like, boo!
[29:16.11]I was going to try to scare you.
[29:17.25]Are you ready for the ear-destroying lightning?
[29:19.11]Because it's probably going to happen in a second.
[29:20.96]I have my volume down to like 30%.
[29:22.30]The same here.
[29:26.92]Okay, so we're heading back to the camp now?
[29:29.38]We safe?
[29:29.92]I guess, yeah.
[29:30.48]What did you put, like, twigs on the, um... Was the food gone from the trap?
[29:38.42]Hold on.
[29:39.22]Are those fireflies to the left?
[29:42.81]I think so, yeah.
[29:43.95]They're, like, glowing green reflecting off the water.
[29:46.25]It's freaking me out.
[29:46.93]Fucking truly.
[29:48.55]Look at that polish, man.
[29:49.51]Alright.
[29:51.09]So... There's... So much polish.
[29:54.37]Did you pick up the sticks?
[29:55.57]How did you put the twigs on?
[29:57.32]Alright, it is... V. V. Okay.
[30:04.62]V doesn't seem to be doing anything.
[30:07.26]One of these traps is covered.
[30:08.32]Alright, we're gonna just take this trap and just move the meat over here.
[30:18.38]Okay, right?
[30:20.16]That's a solid trap, right?
[30:21.86]That's a solid looking trap, I think.
[30:23.50]It's got the meat in it.
[30:25.02]It's got a camera.
[30:25.98]Got a camera on it.
[30:26.70]We can look at it overnight.
[30:29.14]So let's go back to the cabin and let's watch that.
[30:32.22]God, you run like such a dickhead.
[30:34.96]It's truly, truly remarkable.
[30:39.27]Okay.
[30:40.55]I've been like this since high school.
[30:42.45]How hard are you going to laugh if we go back there and he's just in the fridge?
[30:46.72]He's just having a beer.
[30:47.76]Oh, hey, guys.
[30:48.84]I saw you put that trap out there.
[30:50.10]I saw it on the camera.
[30:51.15]You guys are really cool.
[30:52.43]I saw it on the camera.
[30:54.27]Yeah, I came here to get a beer and a snack.
[30:57.49]You guys got any peanuts?
[31:01.33]And then he, like, slaps you on the back really hard.
[31:03.60]He doesn't mean to do it hard, but he does because he's Bigfoot, and it really hurts.
[31:08.14]Just kind of laugh it off.
[31:10.26]Alright.
[31:11.50]Here we are.
[31:13.26]Good thing we left the door open to the camper.
[31:15.16]He really could be inside.
[31:16.46]He could be inside if he wanted to be inside.
[31:18.78]How do you use the rope?
[31:22.81]Presumably you have to get Bigfoot...
[31:27.41]Like, incapacitated somehow.
[31:29.05]By the way, look, that is one of the people that we were looking for.
[31:32.27]Where?
[31:32.97]So that's like an optional objective, I guess.
[31:35.33]We checked off Edward Wilson, who is definitely dead.
[31:38.65]Oh, no.
[31:38.93]Edward.
[31:39.35]Alright.
[31:39.67]Turn the PC to camera five, right?
[31:41.85]Yep.
[31:42.55]How do you change cameras?
[31:44.33]Um, numbers?
[31:45.71]Oh, okay.
[31:46.47]Oh, only one of us can use it at a time.
[31:48.19]Really?
[31:48.57]Okay.
[31:49.33]Alright, so there it is.
[31:50.37]Let's see how it is.
[31:51.81]I have a good shot.
[31:53.94]I wish you could look at this, too.
[31:55.38]That's unfair.
[31:58.31]So how about this?
[31:58.67]How about like I tell you when I see him and you get out there?
[32:01.41]Oh, I hear him.
[32:01.97]I hear him.
[32:03.95]He's like out the door to the right.
[32:06.33]He's like here.
[32:07.20]I'm going to turn off the lights.
[32:13.62]Where is he?
[32:17.14]I don't know.
[32:17.46]I heard him.
[32:18.06]I heard him roar.
[32:18.72]He's just like here?
[32:20.91]Let me look at the cameras.
[32:22.68]You take a look at the camera.
[32:25.06]I can't.
[32:26.66]He would have been this way.
[32:28.06]I'm stuck inside here.
[32:30.73]Let's see.
[32:31.83]Hello!
[32:32.53]Are you out there?
[32:35.71]Okay.
[32:36.43]Hey, look, if you have a second, pick up some milk.
[32:40.80]Thank you.
[32:41.12]Okay.
[32:45.70]What if we do this whole thing and like actually never find him?
[32:48.42]I would laugh.
[32:49.60]No, we gotta find him at some point.
[32:51.04]There's just gotta be a strategy here.
[32:52.34]Let me look at the guide again.
[32:54.60]He likes deer meat.
[32:56.80]What if we find a deer?
[32:58.80]Well, we've got some kind of meat.
[33:00.11]It's probably deer meat.
[33:04.43]Put traps big distance from each other.
[33:06.61]Okay.
[33:11.22]I love how he just sprinted over here in the very beginning and just clawed through the window.
[33:16.10]The skin for Bigfoot is very thick.
[33:19.09]It'll take at least 16 bullets to penetrate the skin.
[33:22.57]That's what it says.
[33:23.35]I don't know how they know this from experience, I guess.
[33:27.01]Alright, well, how do we go to sleep?
[33:31.49]Hold on.
[33:31.91]Can we go to sleep?
[33:33.96]How do you get the camera out?
[33:35.38]We have night vision cameras.
[33:37.06]We do?
[33:37.98]Yeah, it's right-click.
[33:41.11]Oh, that hurts.
[33:42.99]It does, it's horrible.
[33:46.13]It is awful night vision.
[33:48.95]Maybe like in the deep of the forest, away from the lights.
[33:52.86]Eh, it's okay.
[33:54.54]It's possible, yeah.
[33:55.82]Yeah, it's okay.
[33:57.60]It zooms you way in, though, for some reason.
[33:59.94]Yeah, you can zoom in even further.
[34:01.26]I can just see you doing that, too.
[34:02.67]That's funny.
[34:05.00]Oh, where is he?
[34:06.75]He's this way.
[34:07.63]Let's go.
[34:08.81]Okay.
[34:09.13]Let's just go find him.
[34:10.01]Okay, go.
[34:10.49]You go get him, you fucking duck person.
[34:15.03]He's towards the trap.
[34:16.61]Is he?
[34:16.81]He's towards the trap.
[34:18.19]Oh, wow.
[34:18.73]Please tell me he's in that trap.
[34:22.63]I think it's, like, right around this rock.
[34:28.19]If he's stuck in this thing, I'm gonna be so happy.
[34:30.17]And then, okay, who's tying him up?
[34:32.51]Uh, I don't think it's gonna be that easy.
[34:34.73]I think he's going to be stuck in the trap and we can just wrap the rope around him.
[34:38.83]Okay, here's the traps.
[34:40.73]Any sign of him?
[34:42.27]No sign of Bigfoot.
[34:44.07]Oh yeah?
[34:44.57]What did I just hear?
[34:47.27]Did he take the meat?
[34:48.21]I just heard a... Look at the trap.
[34:51.57]Oh no.
[34:52.83]He's been here.
[34:53.56]He's been here and he's injured.
[34:55.62]He's injured and he took the meat.
[34:57.38]Okay.
[34:59.60]Look, there's like a sample.
[35:00.78]There's like blood.
[35:01.56]Bigfoot blood.
[35:01.90]Can we take it?
[35:04.35]Alright, that's good, that's good.
[35:05.73]Look at the top of the screen.
[35:06.69]It glows neon green.
[35:08.21]Oh, we... That's his health.
[35:10.09]That's his boss meter.
[35:10.61]It's gotta be his health.
[35:11.35]Okay, good.
[35:11.65]Good boss meter.
[35:12.57]Alright, so that's a successor.
[35:16.26]Let's put him in the trap.
[35:19.02]I'll come down here.
[35:22.64]Wait, the cameras record, don't they?
[35:24.84]Do they?
[35:25.22]I think, do they?
[35:26.80]Can you, like, go look at old footage?
[35:28.32]I don't know.
[35:29.26]Do you want, should we pick up, we should probably pick up the camera, too.
[35:32.94]Yeah.
[35:33.26]If we're going to move the trap.
[35:34.80]Let's go look for another survivor, too.
[35:36.64]We need to find the other ones.
[35:37.58]Let's go down.
[35:38.28]Okay.
[35:41.58]Got the camera.
[35:47.89]Use the tracking bullets.
[35:53.55]Yeah, we can do that, too.
[35:55.17]Alright, let's go get some more stuff.
[35:57.01]Let's see if we can find the survivor.
[35:58.95]And see if we can track down Bigfoot.
[36:03.99]Exciting.
[36:13.87]These cameras are just useless out here.
[36:16.65]Okay.
[36:17.41]Are you at the RV?
[36:18.05]Yeah.
[36:18.83]Let's take a look at the camera.
[36:23.99]Use PC.
[36:25.43]Camera 5.
[36:26.10]No signal.
[36:27.12]It's because I picked it up.
[36:29.06]I think it's live only.
[36:30.54]Oh, yeah, it is.
[36:32.91]I would be really surprised if it actually recorded.
[36:35.22]Let's take the camera somewhere else.
[36:38.32]Let's go.
[36:39.54]We could just use that instead of the X-Tory.
[36:41.50]I know, really.
[36:44.12]Alright.
[36:44.88]I am right here.
[36:46.32]Let's go.
[36:46.70]Let's head south to, like, that gated up area.
[36:51.04]Put another trap down.
[36:58.14]I am loaded up with tracking bullets.
[37:01.36]I got some too.
[37:02.56]I'll be the one that does the damage, you be the one that does the tracking.
[37:05.90]Okay.
[37:07.75]Sounds good.
[37:09.71]Because I'm going for... We're going southwest to this bridge?
[37:12.99]Yeah, let's head to this bridge area and see what this is.
[37:18.11]Uh-oh.
[37:18.79]Uh-oh, another one.
[37:24.44]Two down.
[37:24.78]Oh dear.
[37:27.43]Oh boy.
[37:28.25]Okay, so she's dead too.
[37:31.19]Yep.
[37:32.05]Confirmed.
[37:32.85]That's another confirmed Bigfoot kill.
[37:35.52]Only two more dead bodies presumably to find.
[37:38.98]What if there actually was one who was still alive and it was like a bot?
[37:43.24]That'd be amazing.
[37:44.56]I really wish that was the case.
[37:46.94]Because I feel like they're all going to be dead.
[37:50.89]Yeah.
[37:51.57]For a little early access game like this, I don't think it's going to be that substantial.
[37:58.97]Here's the gate.
[37:59.45]Okay.
[38:01.89]Why is this just the Friday the 13th game?
[38:04.39]But Bigfoot's just a dumb AI.
[38:08.37]Well, he seems pretty smart so far.
[38:10.57]So far.
[38:10.99]Alright.
[38:12.83]Let's place a... Let's just see into the map.
[38:17.30]I think this is the edge because you can't... This is the edge.
[38:21.34]So, do you want to go down to the lower right?
[38:23.34]Like down this way?
[38:25.72]Yeah, it sounds good.
[38:26.74]Somewhere a little bit closer so that we can get to him if we need to.
[38:32.40]This is going to be like Scooby-Doo.
[38:33.80]I know, really.
[38:34.46]This will be a Scooby-Doo stream.
[38:36.17]We're going to pull the mask off and it's going to be like the guy at the candy store.
[38:39.63]The guy that works at the candy store.
[38:42.29]His elaborate plan.
[38:44.99]I didn't want to sell the Charleston Chews anymore, but now you found out my plan.
[38:52.55]This is a big hill up here.
[38:53.65]This is a big hill.
[38:55.00]Is it daytime yet?
[38:56.90]It's like a real life day-night cycle?
[38:58.80]Is this Ghost Recon?
[39:01.37]Can we keep going up?
[39:04.21]Yeah, this is like the least accessible place possible.
[39:08.57]It's on the edge of the map at the top of a mountain.
[39:12.93]Can you get up here?
[39:16.06]I'm on the top of the mountain.
[39:19.10]You can put the camera up there in the bait and just see how, like, desperate Bigfoot actually is.
[39:22.81]See if Bigfoot's really desperate.
[39:25.47]Do you have any, like, sticks?
[39:26.15]Like, I'm really hungry.
[39:28.21]Shit, I don't want to go all the way up on the mountain.
[39:30.81]No, this is, like, unusable terrain.
[39:32.80]Yeah, there you are.
[39:35.12]Uh-oh.
[39:37.96]What do you mean, uh-oh?
[39:39.56]Uh-oh.
[39:40.24]What happened?
[39:42.79]Uh, careful where you walk.
[39:44.11]That's all I'm gonna say.
[39:45.05]Careful where I walk?
[39:46.75]I'm kind of clipping in.
[39:48.05]Where am I?
[39:50.07]Where am I right now?
[39:51.59]You are... Alright, you kind of just groundhog dayed me.
[39:57.41]You just turned into a groundhog.
[39:58.72]Okay, I can't do it.
[40:05.70]I was gonna shoot you in the face.
[40:09.86]Are you alive?
[40:12.15]Just barely.
[40:15.85]I might not be alive for long at this rate.
[40:17.81]I'm scared.
[40:22.18]Please tell me I can do this.
[40:27.54]That was such a slow fall.
[40:29.62]I'm almost dead.
[40:30.38]I gotta heal.
[40:32.70]One medpack down.
[40:33.76]You got one medpack.
[40:34.56]Good.
[40:35.52]You do this first because I ain't doing that first.
[40:40.43]If we lose, it's going to be start over.
[40:42.39]Well, whatever.
[40:43.42]Like we have done that much anyways.
[40:44.78]Yeah, we did trap him once, though.
[40:46.82]Got to count for something, you know?
[40:50.08]We did take 4% of his health.
[40:52.72]That is true.
[40:53.88]We're doing a great job.
[40:56.06]We've done 4% damage to him.
[40:58.00]Hey, we have evidence of Bigfoot.
[41:01.16]The giant health bar at the top of the screen.
[41:04.23]We have evidence.
[41:04.73]We know he exists.
[41:06.83]You know when you're playing with a cat and you're hiding behind something and the cat reaches and rips around its hand into where it thinks you are?
[41:14.53]That's what happened in the beginning of the game.
[41:15.87]That's our extensive relationship with Bigfoot.
[41:18.07]We're playing with a kitten.
[41:21.26]Who roars like a lion.
[41:22.76]Yeah.
[41:25.93]There's a bridge coming up here.
[41:27.03]We can try to put it on the bridge.
[41:30.47]That sounds so stupid, though.
[41:33.33]Here we go.
[41:34.01]Nothing suspicious at all here.
[41:35.72]Just a big pile of meat.
[41:38.50]We covered it with some branches for camouflage.
[41:40.64]I wish he would just attack us.
[41:43.88]At what point do you just get confident here, Bigfoot, and just come swinging?
[41:48.81]He's probably on a timer.
[41:51.39]What's this?
[41:54.87]It's finally daytime.
[41:56.55]This is elaborate looking that is a rickety looking old bridge it is Alright, I'm gonna walk on it Seems pretty safe from the looks of it I Love how it said find deer meat There has not been a deer this whole game.
[42:23.23]Oh
[42:23.54]I did see one.
[42:24.58]You did see one.
[42:25.84]Yeah.
[42:26.60]I think we just weren't being sneaky enough.
[42:28.95]Yeah, but what is it?
[42:29.73]One deer in the whole forest?
[42:31.89]Okay.
[42:32.67]That's a good point.
[42:33.51]There should be a family of them.
[42:35.47]There should be like 50 families of deer.
[42:38.95]Where are the rabbits?
[42:39.62]Where are the animals?
[42:40.44]Where are the squirrels?
[42:43.28]You know how many squirrels are in the rainforest, Alex?
[42:46.49]These are squirrels that live near Bigfoot.
[42:50.13]So they've gotten used to staying in hiding for much longer periods of time.
[42:54.46]Is there a stamina meter?
[42:58.02]I don't think so.
[42:58.68]I'm running out of sprint.
[43:03.51]Uh...
[43:06.06]Okay, we need to do some more, like, I don't think running around is going to help us.
[43:09.68]We just need to pick a spot and, like, set some traps and then wait for Bigfoot to get close to the traps, like, watch the cameras, and then spring the trap.
[43:17.82]Alright, so here's where we're going to, at least we know, like, the size of the map now.
[43:21.19]So let's curl around here.
[43:23.03]Let's get a little bit closer to the camp.
[43:26.73]And we're on the trail right now.
[43:29.47]There is a chance of finding another survivor here.
[43:33.94]That is true.
[43:35.58]Actually, that's surprising.
[43:36.46]We haven't seen one.
[43:41.92]Alright, we're going to set up trap camera.
[43:45.15]We need to get some twigs, though, right?
[43:49.07]Where'd you get those twigs?
[43:50.83]Just from any little baby tree.
[43:52.85]Any little baby trees?
[43:54.29]I can't seem to grab any.
[43:55.77]Do I have some already?
[43:56.73]I don't know.
[43:57.35]You probably already have some.
[44:03.48]Somebody wrote, to be implemented, Bigfoot.
[44:06.19]Like he's not in the game yet.
[44:08.31]He's got to be patched in.
[44:10.25]Update 2.0.
[44:12.59]Actually, I think there was an update recently.
[44:16.50]Alright.
[44:17.94]We're getting to the point where we can like... We're kind of just walking around the edge of the map right now.
[44:21.40]Let's do it.
[44:22.08]Let's get cut across here.
[44:23.52]We're going to drop trap food right at the edge of this.
[44:33.40]Right like here.
[44:34.04]Right before the lake.
[44:37.35]I'd say like right here is a good spot.
[44:38.93]I'm going to drop trap.
[44:39.79]Hold on, hold on.
[44:40.35]Have we looked up here yet?
[44:41.95]There might be some ammo or like health or something up here.
[44:45.15]Hey, there's a trap and some ammunition.
[44:47.21]Okay, how many bullets do you have?
[44:48.69]50.
[44:49.20]Okay, I'll take it.
[44:51.54]Okay, so I'm dropping trap.
[44:52.94]I'm dropping food.
[44:54.88]We need some twigs on here now.
[44:56.06]What is it, V?
[44:57.84]I'm going to set up a camera.
[44:59.02]Okay, got it.
[45:01.99]So I believe this has been...
[45:04.81]Set the camera up.
[45:06.95]Get it in a good spot, too.
[45:08.95]Working on it.
[45:09.47]Okay.
[45:11.71]Well, don't really want to put it in.
[45:13.05]I'm trying to camouflage it.
[45:14.07]What if I put it up here?
[45:14.59]What the hell was that alien sound?
[45:17.68]It's probably the camera.
[45:20.32]That was the camera?
[45:24.24]Bad noise?
[45:25.60]No, that was not a camera.
[45:28.34]Well, did it sound like this?
[45:37.56]No, that was a deer.
[45:40.92]It was a deer?
[45:41.78]Where's the deer?
[45:43.46]Turn your flashlight off.
[45:54.57]Where?
[45:54.95]I don't know.
[45:56.13]How do you lure deer?
[45:57.33]I don't know.
[45:57.99]You got a camera.
[45:58.67]You put the camera there, though, right?
[46:00.55]Yeah, I did.
[46:01.11]I put the camera there.
[46:02.17]Okay.
[46:02.75]So we can just get back to camp, watch the camera.
[46:04.74]Let's go back to camp.
[46:07.07]I'm just gonna watch.
[46:07.75]I'm gonna be like, okay, you guys don't know what this game is.
[46:09.91]This is just the board security guard game.
[46:13.69]I'm just sitting in, like, mall security.
[46:17.51]I don't get paid enough for this.
[46:19.40]Yeah, we're just sitting here and, like, watch, like, five TVs.
[46:22.46]Hey, Joe, can you give me some coffee and a donut?
[46:24.56]Yeah.
[46:25.20]Oh, wait, somebody just went into Nordstrom's and, like, stole something.
[46:29.62]I better, like, walk over there and just, like, fart in his face.
[46:35.11]What is this?
[46:37.81]I don't remember this.
[46:38.39]Alright, whatever, this way.
[46:41.93]Okay, so we're going back to base.
[46:49.95]Should one of us stay out and about?
[46:53.20]We got a campsite here, friend.
[46:55.44]Oh.
[46:56.60]We've got a campsite.
[46:58.16]We do.
[46:58.60]I think that means we're gonna find a dead camper.
[47:02.22]Alright, let's find door number three.
[47:05.44]Got some medicine.
[47:10.15]That's just an empty shirt.
[47:12.99]Is this a guy?
[47:13.79]Where's the body?
[47:15.99]Unidentifiable.
[47:19.73]His hoodie got over here somehow.
[47:23.37]And there's more blood.
[47:25.73]And then there's a paddle.
[47:28.39]They attempted to use the paddle and a lantern for self-defense.
[47:34.27]And it failed.
[47:36.55]Hey, a deer, a deer, a deer.
[47:38.59]No!
[47:43.90]Alright, how do we get it?
[47:45.40]How do we eat it?
[47:46.08]How do we make Bigfoot eat this?
[47:48.04]This deer is huge.
[47:49.28]Why don't we make Bigfoot eat it?
[47:51.95]I don't know.
[47:52.41]Let's put a trap down over here.
[47:55.99]Put a trap down underneath it.
[47:56.83]I'm going to put a trap here.
[47:59.27]Okay.
[48:00.23]And I'm going to put a trap there.
[48:02.31]And so now... And I put some meat on the traps, you know, because just because.
[48:06.87]Why not?
[48:07.31]Well, you were making like a Thanksgiving feast for Bigfoot.
[48:09.79]I am.
[48:10.16]Alright, let's get a good camera spot.
[48:12.32]Okay.
[48:12.96]Yeah.
[48:13.28]We probably want... I got one camera here.
[48:15.64]Put it a little further away.
[48:17.02]Okay.
[48:17.68]He's already here.
[48:18.18]He's already here.
[48:19.12]Run, run, run, run.
[48:19.58]Get away from it.
[48:20.04]Run away.
[48:21.98]Eventually he'll get here and we're gonna light him the fuck up.
[48:23.44]Just wait for him to hit the trap?
[48:24.76]Yep.
[48:25.68]Okay, so let's like hide behind these trees over here?
[48:27.66]Yep.
[48:27.88]Alright, get out your binoculars.
[48:28.92]Can you get- you get that way?
[48:29.78]God, that's so bright.
[48:30.52]I can't even see.
[48:31.08]What's binocular?
[48:32.81]Where- where is it?
[48:33.29]I can't even see where it is.
[48:37.05]Where's binoculars?
[48:38.25]Is there binoculars?
[48:42.01]Which way is he?
[48:43.97]I don't know.
[48:44.51]Where did you go?
[48:45.03]Okay, hold on.
[48:45.93]I'm next to you, dude.
[48:46.72]Right here.
[48:47.08]I'm just so- I'm freaking the fuck out right now.
[48:49.18]I really am just scared.
[48:52.41]We didn't look I can see the camera bigfoot came over here.
[48:54.77]We would know okay.
[48:56.25]It's directly ahead of where we're looking right now right yep Okay, can't can't use night vision camera.
[49:02.44]No.
[49:02.88]Let's just sit here and zoom in Is there a crumb?
[49:06.80]No, it's not just don't sprint Okay, don't sprint when he gets there remember the do we cover up the traps No, I don't think we do we got to cover the trap.
[49:15.58]He's too smart.
[49:16.12]Oh
[49:20.69]Okay, I got this one.
[49:22.28]I'm gonna take the camera.
[49:23.68]Okay.
[49:24.36]You got that one?
[49:24.82]Okay.
[49:25.10]Get out of the way.
[49:27.30]Well, let's put the camera down anyway, just in case we have to leave it.
[49:29.74]Okay, we're gonna put it, like, back here.
[49:31.12]Like, here.
[49:33.00]I'm gonna say, like, right here.
[49:35.64]Okay.
[49:35.88]Alright, now we hide for a second.
[49:43.48]Is this hidden enough?
[49:48.14]I mean, I can't...
[49:57.79]I'm not going to laugh so hard if we turn around and he's behind us.
[50:04.83]I mean, that's a big... That's a snack, man.
[50:07.47]That's a big snack for him.
[50:13.39]I feel like we may have... I'm expecting good things, but I think he can smell us.
[50:16.39]I think, yeah, we may have lost our opportunity.
[50:19.47]Because we didn't cover him?
[50:21.03]No, I mean, he made that noise.
[50:22.45]Let's just keep walking over here.
[50:23.49]Just, like, stay... Hug the wall.
[50:33.32]I'm gonna go back up on the rock.
[50:34.36]There's like a pretty good vantage point right here.
[50:36.60]Is there?
[50:36.82]Ooh, yeah, there is.
[50:40.55]There's just gotta be here on purpose.
[50:46.61]You think so, right?
[50:51.78]Alright.
[50:52.06]There's like a couple of trees in the way, but... Maybe we can keep going this way.
[50:58.44]It's a little better.
[51:01.52]Although, I'm just not sure he's gonna show up.
[51:04.06]I don't think he's gonna show up while we've... Well, we have a camera there.
[51:07.08]We're good.
[51:07.84]We can come back if we need to.
[51:09.38]Don't kill me.
[51:10.48]Thanks, God.
[51:12.68]Don't jump off of any cliffs.
[51:14.59]Yeah.
[51:15.19]I, like, skinned my knee.
[51:16.19]Okay.
[51:16.65]Ooh.
[51:18.39]Let's leave it be.
[51:18.93]But don't forget, when we're injured, he can smell it.
[51:21.71]Yep.
[51:22.45]Okay.
[51:25.15]Head back to camp.
[51:26.05]We can stare at the monitor.
[51:27.31]He's number five, by the way.
[51:28.41]Okay, number five.
[51:33.10]Four is like a... There's like a giant lake in between us and the camp.
[51:37.40]So we're not going to be able to... I guess we go west?
[51:43.30]Yeah, we want to go west.
[51:44.84]Etalyx, you can't swim in this water.
[51:48.00]There are boats!
[51:48.70]I wish you could use the boats.
[51:50.86]That would be actually really cool.
[51:52.30]There's an invisible wall here, okay.
[51:53.90]So then, duly noted.
[51:56.17]Can't go that way.
[51:56.79]No swimming.
[52:00.61]Alrighty.
[52:01.33]Well... That's really annoying.
[52:04.81]You can't use the boats.
[52:10.09]They're just there for fun.
[52:11.83]They're on the change list for the next patch.
[52:18.38]Okay, we gotta see Bigfoot in person at least one time.
[52:21.05]Alright, here's what's gonna happen.
[52:23.89]I'm going to stay the fuck away.
[52:26.95]Like, you look.
[52:28.35]I'll go back to base and look through the camera.
[52:30.49]Yeah.
[52:31.07]Okay.
[52:31.81]And when he gets close, I'll tell you.
[52:33.57]But you stay, like, within sight.
[52:37.25]Not like sight necessarily, but I could easily run there before he gets away.
[52:41.48]Yeah.
[52:41.76]I mean, I'm very close.
[52:44.50]I'm right there.
[52:46.68]If you tell me to go, I'm going.
[52:48.04]And I'm going to go fight him.
[52:49.54]And I'll try.
[52:49.92]I am almost back to the RV.
[52:51.90]Okay, good.
[52:57.72]I'm gonna laugh if the whole carcass is gone.
[53:01.14]If you just go back and the deer's already gone.
[53:03.26]The deer's just gone.
[53:03.98]Alright, let me just, I'm gonna take a look.
[53:07.18]I mean, the guy definitely says, most of all, they like deer meat.
[53:12.80]Make sure this is all set.
[53:13.68]Do we have to, like, cut it open or anything?
[53:15.64]I don't think we have to cut it open.
[53:19.64]Maybe we do.
[53:21.44]Uh, I doubt it.
[53:23.77]Okay, I'm at the RV right now flashlight bait camera disguise a trap trap Medicine chests interaction.
[53:33.39]No, it's just Okay, you're you're very close I know I know you were on top of the time I was just making sure we like didn't like oh cut open it got him, you know cut the thing open Okay, it's gonna it's starting to get dark here
[53:52.75]Where even is... I hear another deer.
[53:55.79]I hear there's another deer.
[53:56.77]Wait, there's another deer?
[53:58.07]Okay, it's, uh, remember where we were walking over the, uh, the log?
[54:01.77]Yeah.
[54:02.75]He's under the log that's, like, suspended between the two rocks.
[54:06.39]How did you see that?
[54:07.98]Because I have a camera.
[54:08.88]Okay, he's walking kind of away from it now, like, away from the traps.
[54:15.14]I see him.
[54:15.88]I can't see it anymore.
[54:16.80]I see him.
[54:19.14]Just waiting for the gunshots.
[54:20.32]He's kind of too far away, though.
[54:23.10]And then I'm gonna put a camera on this one, too.
[54:24.58]I see you just, like, moving.
[54:29.39]God damn it!
[54:30.05]I, like, ran into a tree!
[54:31.49]I've ran into a tree!
[54:33.11]He's not getting away.
[54:34.19]This is... I gotta get him for Bigfoot purpose.
[54:35.81]You're letting him get away.
[54:36.75]I gotta get him for the purpose of Bigfoot!
[54:40.52]Okay, while you're doing that...
[54:43.70]I'm watching the traps.
[54:45.27]He's gone.
[54:45.97]Like, he got away.
[54:46.83]I just did not expect him to- He sprinted like, ugh.
[54:51.43]I see you again.
[54:52.37]How the fuck are you supposed to- You're too close.
[55:01.72]Also, we just shot the gun twice, so I'm assuming he knows.
[55:04.17]Goddammit.
[55:10.79]I can just barely see you.
[55:12.05]Okay, by the way, I was so far away when he started sprinting.
[55:15.33]Oh, I hear him.
[55:17.15]Oh, oh, oh, okay.
[55:18.63]You let me know.
[55:19.49]He's pretty far away.
[55:20.73]Like, I haven't seen him, but from the sound, he's pretty far away.
[55:23.83]Okay, well, that was really close to me.
[55:28.59]That was very close to me.
[55:29.59]Didn't sound like that to me.
[55:30.45]Sounded close to me.
[55:31.96]What if...
[55:36.21]What if he opens the window behind me while I'm at the computer?
[55:39.03]Then you're dead.
[55:39.63]Then I'm dead.
[55:41.23]Okay, are you sure he's not like... Are you sure he's not over there?
[55:46.04]He is absolutely not over here.
[55:48.54]I have a... good view.
[55:50.68]I'm gonna check the other cameras.
[55:55.49]I should just put, like, a camera down for you, right?
[55:59.49]Yeah, as long as it's not so far away that we have to go back and, like... There needs to be something close by.
[56:04.43]Like, maybe multiple traps and multiple bait.
[56:08.55]Like, I see a trap we set over there.
[56:10.63]I don't know why.
[56:11.71]By camera four, there's a trap.
[56:13.25]I'm going to try to track him.
[56:14.59]Go to camera four.
[56:16.09]Camera four.
[56:18.87]Okay.
[56:19.89]I can do that.
[56:20.65]And, like, set some bait.
[56:22.97]I don't have any.
[56:24.56]okay well um in that case I don't know what to tell you I think I hear him you hear him I don't know are you near any camera uh I'm getting I'm going towards four okay you did put six by the log cabin so if you put uh if we have something by the log cabin that would be good too yeah
[56:52.99]Which one did you say you were by?
[56:53.93]Go to four.
[56:55.11]Okay.
[56:57.09]I'm not wearing camo patterned clothes.
[57:04.77]No, I'm not.
[57:06.49]I'm there.
[57:09.16]Okay, looking at five.
[57:13.56]He's still not here.
[57:17.10]Was there bait on this trap?
[57:19.70]Yeah, this one's baited.
[57:21.57]The one at four is baited.
[57:22.75]Did you cover it up?
[57:23.85]Yeah, it's covered with twigs.
[57:26.95]Okay.
[57:27.71]I'll do it again.
[57:28.17]I'm going to move it a little bit over here.
[57:30.65]I see him.
[57:31.29]What do you mean you see him?
[57:33.86]He's at five?
[57:34.20]He's going to five.
[57:35.04]He's not at there yet.
[57:35.92]He's slowly walking there.
[57:38.68]From... I don't know.
[57:40.00]It's away from the camp.
[57:41.42]Okay, so five.
[57:43.08]He's walking towards five right now.
[57:44.74]Okay, I'm going to light him the fuck up.
[57:50.35]On my way.
[57:50.95]He's almost there.
[57:51.95]I'm coming.
[57:52.27]I'm going.
[57:52.51]He's got glowing, terrifying eyes.
[57:54.13]I'm going.
[57:54.41]He's at the traps.
[57:55.67]Oh, God.
[57:56.49]He stepped in the trap.
[57:57.43]He stepped in the trap.
[57:58.17]Is he still there?
[57:59.13]He yelled.
[57:59.59]He just howled.
[58:00.48]Did he run?
[58:01.60]He's eating the meat on one of the traps.
[58:03.02]Oh, boy.
[58:03.32]I'm going to write the face of the tracking bullet.
[58:04.84]I'm going to be a hero.
[58:05.78]Alright.
[58:06.44]Hold on.
[58:07.16]He's running away.
[58:07.92]He's running away.
[58:08.42]Which way?
[58:08.78]Which way?
[58:09.06]Which way?
[58:09.34]Which way?
[58:09.60]Which way?
[58:09.90]He's going under the arch.
[58:11.50]Under the wood.
[58:12.32]Oh, that fucking little asshole.
[58:14.77]He sprinted away, dude.
[58:16.05]Did he hear you?
[58:17.03]Did you sprint?
[58:18.63]I'm like far away.
[58:20.12]He ate, and I think, like, he got wounded, and he just took off running.
[58:24.11]So he went this way?
[58:26.23]Um... Yeah, he went the direction, like, from the traps, under the wooden beam, and he just sprinted that direction.
[58:34.14]Okay.
[58:37.32]He ran right by the camera.
[58:39.26]Okay, I'm looking at four, because he might go to four if he's still hungry.
[58:45.23]Maybe.
[58:50.73]Let me check the traps here.
[58:52.79]Five?
[58:53.37]One of the traps might still be okay.
[58:55.05]I see one of them has been sprung.
[58:57.25]Dine and Dash.
[59:00.09]He really did dash.
[59:02.82]He ran so fast.
[59:04.28]Let's see.
[59:06.08]Oh, I see you there.
[59:08.22]Okay.
[59:11.82]He bit the head off the deer and stepped in the trap.
[59:15.34]I'm taking this stuff.
[59:17.28]What's in the other trap?
[59:18.02]Is it still good?
[59:19.26]The other trap is pretty much done so.
[59:21.61]Hold on.
[59:22.23]I gotta check the cameras around the base.
[59:25.73]I fear for my own safety.
[59:26.75]Check four.
[59:27.15]I see a flashlight across the water.
[59:35.69]He would be going to four.
[59:38.03]Hold on.
[59:39.57]Hold on.
[59:40.83]I think I saw a deer possibly running away from Bigfoot.
[59:45.39]Not sure.
[59:45.79]It looked like a deer running.
[59:50.13]Okay, so you're talking about that was at four.
[59:53.00]Yeah, it was near four.
[59:54.78]It wasn't at four.
[59:56.16]I'm just going to walk.
[59:56.78]It was like if you run around the lake towards four, you would get there.
[60:00.44]I'm going to walk.
[60:00.92]I'm going to be very slow about this.
[60:04.95]I do not have eyes on Bigfoot.
[60:07.79]Okay.
[60:17.94]I am actually scared right now.
[60:19.92]Hey, we went from 4% to like 8%, right?
[60:21.46]Yeah, it was a step in the right direction.
[60:24.22]I feel like the lower he gets, the more violent he's going to become.
[60:30.05]Okay, I'm currently about to be at 4.
[60:31.55]There's no sign of him at 4, you said.
[60:34.03]No sign at 4.
[60:34.71]Okay.
[60:41.22]Going to check around the van.
[60:47.14]No sign of him here.
[60:48.02]I mean, there is still a carcass there at 5.
[60:51.64]Okay, I see you.
[60:53.65]Yeah.
[60:56.27]This is actually kind of cool.
[60:57.25]Like, being camera guy is kind of cool.
[60:58.93]Yeah.
[61:00.63]Alright, well... Where is he?
[61:02.75]Where is this guy?
[61:05.08]He's at 5!
[61:05.86]He's at 5?
[61:06.32]He's at 5!
[61:07.54]He's at 5.
[61:08.06]What does he keep going to 5 for?
[61:11.98]Is he eating?
[61:12.46]He's...
[61:13.61]No, he's just walking past it.
[61:15.09]He's just walking past it.
[61:15.95]He's just upset.
[61:17.11]He's walked past it.
[61:19.03]So where is he walking towards?
[61:20.23]He was right next to the camera, uh, walking, like, if you keep the camp to your right and the trap to your left, that's the direction he went.
[61:31.60]He's gone now.
[61:32.76]Oh, shit.
[61:33.42]So he's, like, over here.
[61:35.56]I gotta get a tracking ball to the...
[61:39.68]I'm just going to- I'm just going to- OOH!
[61:42.44]Where is he?!
[61:43.36]Where is he?!
[61:44.30]He's behind me!
[61:45.26]He's behind me!
[61:46.68]Where is he?!
[61:48.58]What?!
[61:49.70]Oh!
[61:50.00]He's going to four!
[61:50.88]What do you mean he's going to four?!
[61:52.08]He just attacked me!
[61:54.47]He just- He just attacked me!
[61:55.55]I don't know where he was!
[61:57.95]He just ran past four camera.
[61:59.05]What did he do?!
[61:59.43]He ran past camera four.
[62:02.05]What?!
[62:03.19]Where the fuck was he?!
[62:04.21]I didn't even see him!
[62:05.45]Yeah, he ran past four camera.
[62:09.84]Honest to God.
[62:10.18]He could be coming for me next.
[62:11.98]Okay, I'm going to- can you see me?
[62:14.04]No.
[62:14.52]Oh yeah, he turned left.
[62:18.22]I keep going that way.
[62:20.31]And a little to the right, and that's the direction he went.
[62:22.93]Like a little left.
[62:25.31]What?!
[62:26.65]He just bolted in that direction.
[62:28.41]Dude, he just dis-a-fucking-peered!
[62:30.87]He didn't even exist!
[62:31.47]He could be coming for me.
[62:33.55]Dude, this dude doesn't exist.
[62:34.61]He's fast, man.
[62:35.47]He's fast.
[62:36.83]I've seen him.
[62:37.53]Like, I have proof.
[62:40.00]Alright, I'm just gonna sit here at four.
[62:42.82]He just like... He just slapped you on the back and was like, hey, you want some chicken?
[62:47.81]And then ran.
[62:48.45]I think the trap at four... Where is he?
[62:55.17]Mom?
[62:57.16]Are you dead?
[62:57.58]I'm dead.
[62:59.78]I heard your cry from across the land.
[63:04.39]So being out at night while wounded, probably not a good idea is what I'm gathering.
[63:11.38]I called for mom.
[63:13.26]He's coming for you.
[63:14.55]He's coming for me.
[63:17.39]I didn't have a heal.
[63:19.87]I couldn't even shoot him.
[63:20.83]That was like a movie.
[63:22.88]He's at four.
[63:23.92]He just ate four.
[63:25.18]And he bolted off past it again.
[63:27.48]He took you down, and then he's still hungry.
[63:29.70]You can't save the beast.
[63:30.91]I think we're getting a better understanding of how this game works.
[63:33.83]Yeah.
[63:34.47]I think we'll be able to kill this.
[63:35.31]We're figuring it out.
[63:35.87]We're going to kill this guy this next time.
[63:37.75]But good luck.
[63:39.87]I can just run out there and go die.
[63:41.67]Because you can't respawn, right?
[63:44.05]I cannot respawn.
[63:48.49]Okay.
[63:49.77]Well, let's go find him then.
[63:52.80]That was boring for 50 minutes.
[63:57.50]There was a lot of exciting stuff happening on my side.
[64:05.42]Let me just find a high place to fall off of or something.
[64:08.68]The task was too difficult for you.
[64:12.47]I'm having a good time.
[64:13.11]This is fun enough.
[64:15.45]I want to see what happens when we actually get a good contact.
[64:18.43]It's a really good idea for a game, actually.
[64:21.02]Yeah, it's an interesting idea.
[64:24.18]Probably pulled off by one or two people.
[64:27.00]Yeah, I don't think this was boring.
[64:28.26]I thought this was fun.
[64:31.16]It's super goofy in terms of...
[64:35.51]Like no reload animation and stuff, but like the heart of the game I think is cool Yeah, I was referring to somebody in chat.
[64:43.49]I was saying that so I was just like hey.
[64:45.28]It's not boring It's boring trying to fall from a high place because I can't climb this rock The jump animation is fantastic.
[64:59.00]I want to see like what happens if you actually Trap him oh my God
[65:07.78]Getting more people to play with, the maximum is three.
[65:10.66]Okay, almost.
[65:13.56]Should I just leave?
[65:14.92]I should just leave.
[65:17.11]When we both lose, we just leave, right?
[65:18.91]I think so.
[65:20.13]Okay.
[65:20.41]Let's see.
[65:20.93]Yeah, you just disappeared.
[65:21.53]You're gone.
[65:24.79]It was too difficult.
[65:27.73]Okay.
[65:28.23]I gotta cover it up.
[65:30.03]Yeah, same exact thing.
[65:34.58]No need to change.
[65:35.36]Why would we change it?
[65:40.78]and it is up it is there for you to join we had a pretty good system though like the the camera to runner deal was uh it was it was well intentioned a little bit of refinement necessary but alright uh gets traps medicine take the rifles
[66:06.89]Split it up so we get an even amount.
[66:09.72]And let's go, let's actually go for it this time.
[66:11.56]You know what I mean?
[66:12.98]Let's really go for it.
[66:13.92]Let's try to get this guy.
[66:14.98]Alright, one sec.
[66:23.39]Got a thing of medicine.
[66:35.55]Let's go.
[66:35.97]Okay, so I got ammo, got meds, got night vision.
[66:42.73]So we came across potentially three of these people, right?
[66:46.58]I'm gonna be the hot baby this time, so that Bigfoot really wants to kill me.
[66:51.80]So why don't we... Just... Why don't we bait and have like our home base?
[66:58.42]Why do we have to go so far away?
[67:00.68]Why don't we try like doing it close?
[67:01.82]Oh, we probably don't.
[67:03.00]You know, why don't we try doing it like... Like within, I don't know, like 500 meters or something?
[67:07.16]We don't have to go that far away.
[67:08.02]Did you take me?
[67:09.06]Oh, I did not.
[67:09.52]I was just checking to see how far away we could be.
[67:12.24]Wait, I see a deer already.
[67:13.55]Already?
[67:13.81]Where?
[67:14.51]It ran away.
[67:15.15]It heard you sprinting.
[67:17.45]It's gone.
[67:19.99]And I don't know if they disappear or if we could actually chase it, because if we can chase it, it's this direction.
[67:24.97]Alright, grab some tracking bullets.
[67:27.52]Oh, I forgot to get that stuff.
[67:29.10]Rope.
[67:31.28]Turning around.
[67:35.68]Use the FPC.
[67:39.82]Use the CD-ROM.
[67:40.68]Alright.
[67:45.83]Let's try to get Bigfoot.
[67:48.51]Do you get signal bullets in case we get separated?
[67:51.09]I do.
[67:51.67]I have tracking bullets.
[67:53.35]I have flares.
[67:55.29]I don't have any meat, though.
[67:56.25]Okay.
[67:59.81]I got meat.
[68:01.41]Let's do it.
[68:04.52]Take a deep breath.
[68:05.80]So where do you want to put, like, the option one?
[68:10.30]Like camera number one?
[68:11.82]I say camera number one.
[68:13.32]Let's do after this branch, like over here.
[68:15.72]Let's go... I don't think he's gonna come that close to the RV.
[68:18.88]No.
[68:19.02]Because we got lights, we got noise, we're gonna be sprinting.
[68:21.46]It needs to be like a decent little distance away, but spread out kind of like a round home base.
[68:26.35]Yeah.
[68:27.07]So I say we put one kind of back... He liked the one towards the swamp to the north.
[68:34.67]We've already seen him eat from there, so why don't we just kind of retrace our steps and start from there.
[68:39.73]He really seemed to have been hanging around at the edge of that swamp over and over again.
[68:43.89]Yeah.
[68:45.19]The swamp and the lake, he liked both of those places.
[68:48.88]I'd say, I'd say, like, even if something, like, let's do one here.
[68:53.52]Why not, right?
[68:55.02]Let's do, like, in a row.
[68:56.12]This is so close.
[68:57.38]Well, I mean, let's just do them in, like, a succession, you know?
[69:00.94]So we're not, like, camera one's all the way over there, camera two's all the way over there.
[69:04.60]If you put them in a circle instead of a line, you have more ways to kind of get to him.
[69:10.15]So, like, let's say you put them in a line, right?
[69:12.15]And he goes to number two, but you're at number five.
[69:16.97]Yeah.
[69:18.43]then when you go to him, it's going to scare him so far away, potentially that, you know what I'm saying?
[69:23.93]Like, if you spread them out, he might, like, run away, but also run to another location.
[69:29.09]Alright, so you want to do, like, right at the base of the water or something?
[69:34.80]Like, kind of, like, over here?
[69:35.80]Yeah, there's a couple little, um... See on the map, there's, like, where the road kind of goes into the water almost?
[69:44.38]Mm-hmm.
[69:46.42]I see.
[69:46.64]Yeah, like, right here.
[69:50.37]I like how this turned from funny gameplay to serious strategic... He's right there!
[69:55.16]He's right in front of us!
[69:57.16]He's literally right in front of us walking this way.
[69:58.66]Is he really?
[69:59.06]Yeah, just walk.
[70:00.42]Okay.
[70:01.86]Flashlights off?
[70:02.65]Flashlights off.
[70:03.35]Just walk.
[70:05.03]He's legit walking over here.
[70:08.39]Like, what kind of pace?
[70:09.93]I don't know.
[70:10.37]I just saw, like, a man walking.
[70:13.93]Oh, no, never mind.
[70:14.43]It was a deer.
[70:15.95]But it's okay because we need that.
[70:16.99]Make sure you don't have tracking because I've got tracking on.
[70:21.21]Yeah.
[70:22.54]Did you get it?
[70:23.32]He's gone.
[70:25.20]Oh, he's gone?
[70:26.10]No, I tracked him.
[70:27.08]I tracked the deer.
[70:28.44]I tracked him.
[70:29.72]Well, maybe we can find out how tracking works.
[70:31.84]He's on the map.
[70:32.75]He's a red blip on the map.
[70:34.03]He's a red blip on the map.
[70:35.95]That's cool.
[70:37.17]Okay.
[70:37.61]I wonder how long that lasts.
[70:41.76]I don't know.
[70:42.12]I want to see if he runs off the map because he's still just going in a straight line.
[70:45.38]Dude, this is crazy.
[70:46.70]He finally stopped.
[70:48.76]He stops up there.
[70:54.45]How about like right over here?
[70:55.89]Okay.
[70:56.79]Yeah.
[70:58.77]Like right here?
[71:00.77]Don't put it in like a dip.
[71:02.09]Put it like on flat ground or somewhere where we could kind of see from a better vantage point.
[71:08.84]Like this clearing.
[71:10.90]Like right here.
[71:11.46]I'm going to put the camera right behind this tree right over here.
[71:15.50]There we go.
[71:18.85]Okay, we got a trap.
[71:21.71]It's covered up, camouflaged.
[71:23.89]Alright, let's keep going around here.
[71:32.77]This ram deer is still on the map.
[71:34.15]Let's try to take care of this.
[71:36.03]A tracker left pretty long then, I guess.
[71:39.53]Just fucking go for a shot.
[71:40.79]Just kill it.
[71:41.59]We need that good spot.
[71:43.93]He's right up here.
[71:44.51]Okay, I'm just going to walk.
[71:46.39]There's no reason to sprint.
[71:48.00]No reason to sprint.
[71:49.02]To your left, so you don't shoot me.
[71:51.40]There he is.
[71:53.22]Where is he?
[71:53.50]Where the hell is he?
[72:00.47]What?
[72:00.61]What?
[72:02.79]Did he drop the tracker?
[72:03.73]Did it, like, fall off?
[72:04.57]There he is.
[72:05.58]No, he's, like... Got him.
[72:08.84]MLG.
[72:10.14]Oh, well.
[72:10.74]Uh-oh.
[72:12.24]He's at the trap.
[72:13.00]That's the one we just set.
[72:13.84]That's the trap.
[72:15.36]Oh, no.
[72:16.50]Okay, I'm fine.
[72:17.30]Where is he?
[72:17.58]Where is he?
[72:18.12]At the trap.
[72:18.44]This way.
[72:19.92]Yep, okay.
[72:25.29]Heavy breathing intensifies.
[72:26.47]I don't see him.
[72:33.60]Where's the trap?
[72:34.10]You didn't even touch it.
[72:34.60]It's right here.
[72:37.26]Okay.
[72:37.84]Well, it definitely came from this direction.
[72:40.99]Okay, let's go back to the deer.
[72:42.21]I killed it.
[72:43.41]Alright.
[72:44.79]He was in the direction of the trap.
[72:48.03]It's freaking me out right now.
[72:50.51]I'm just like going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.
[72:54.22]Like a walrus.
[73:01.70]Okay.
[73:02.47]So, the dead deer is across the river.
[73:11.35]There is an easier way to cross, I guess, a blog.
[73:13.61]That was the deer screaming.
[73:16.70]It's, like, right over here somewhere.
[73:18.40]He was, like, tracked over here.
[73:19.98]No, no, no, you're going too far.
[73:21.36]I shot him, like, from the other side of the river, so... Oh, God, where did you go?
[73:25.82]I lost you.
[73:26.32]Should have flared him.
[73:27.51]By the river.
[73:28.03]Oh.
[73:36.76]I don't see the body.
[73:37.52]You sure you got it?
[73:41.28]I am absolutely positive.
[73:43.28]So I shot him from that side of the river and he was on this side of the river.
[73:47.30]So he he's not going to be very far in.
[73:49.49]He's going to be towards the water.
[73:55.65]Like, he would be easily visible from the other side.
[73:59.95]Yeah, if he gets caught, if he were to touch the trap, the health bar would appear.
[74:03.87]That's true.
[74:05.31]True.
[74:07.28]That is true.
[74:12.80]These shotguns are very small, aren't they?
[74:15.72]We either have huge hands, or these are baby shotguns.
[74:19.28]If only I didn't get distracted by a stupid howl.
[74:22.86]Oh, well.
[74:23.16]Alright, let's stick with the plan.
[74:24.30]Let's go to the other side of the bridge.
[74:25.86]Like, and do it down to the left.
[74:31.82]And then I'm gonna head back to home base!
[74:35.42]You dying?
[74:35.86]No, I'm fine.
[74:36.20]I'm gonna head back to home base.
[74:40.42]I'd say, like, over here.
[74:43.25]Where is here?
[74:44.85]Here is here.
[74:45.85]That scared me.
[74:49.90]It lights up your screen even when you're nowhere close.
[74:53.92]As far as I know, I just caught fire from Magical Bigfoot.
[74:57.28]Magical Bigfoot.
[74:58.40]Well, he did explode a tree earlier.
[75:00.04]Don't forget.
[75:01.93]Yeah, I don't know what that was.
[75:04.79]That has not happened in the hour and 20 minutes.
[75:08.37]We've been in this game for more than an hour.
[75:09.79]That has only happened one time.
[75:13.15]I still don't know what it was.
[75:14.50]I'm going to put a camera here.
[75:16.52]Right here.
[75:17.64]Okay, splitting up is not a bad idea.
[75:22.70]That's not a terrible idea.
[75:24.58]Not until it's night.
[75:25.46]When it hits nighttime, then we'll be in trouble.
[75:36.13]That one is crap that one so we got one on either side of the water just in case you know I mean Okay, I'm gonna.
[75:43.93]I'm gonna head back.
[75:45.29]Okay.
[75:46.41]This looks like a really good spot I'm gonna put one more like on the other side like in the base of the lake to the left I'm gonna say like here
[76:03.56]And then I'm going to head back and I'm going to be cameraman.
[76:06.35]Okay.
[76:10.41]It's kind of scary.
[76:12.33]So you get to be scared man.
[76:16.53]I get to be dead man.
[76:20.64]Let's put this over here.
[76:29.32]Okay.
[76:31.76]Alright, so...
[76:34.93]I'm heading back to the RV.
[76:37.78]And I will guide you.
[76:38.60]I will be your guide.
[76:42.06]Okay, I'm spreading these out.
[76:46.49]This might be too spread out, but... At least we're gonna have a lot of coverage.
[76:52.41]Yeah, we will have definitely plenty of coverage.
[76:55.29]There's no... They're all faded.
[76:58.29]They're in a good, like, triangle kind of penis shape, you know?
[77:05.03]Are they?
[77:06.14]No, not really.
[77:06.94]Like, no.
[77:09.26]No, it's... Okay, that's a T. I don't know why I went immediately to the gutter like that.
[77:14.84]I'm sorry about that one.
[77:17.23]Just straight there.
[77:18.89]Hang on, let me look.
[77:22.12]I don't even, I don't see any of those shapes, but okay.
[77:25.02]I found the dead guy.
[77:26.92]What is that noise?
[77:28.54]That's the found the dead guy noise, I think.
[77:30.52]Oh, yeah, that's the found the dead person noise.
[77:32.19]Got it.
[77:33.73]Coming back up.
[77:34.61]Just for shits?
[77:36.17]Uh-huh.
[77:36.53]Just for, like, giggles?
[77:38.63]I was going to try to put a trap inside the cage.
[77:43.19]I found another deer.
[77:44.47]Oh, you did?
[77:45.29]It's pretty much running away, though.
[77:49.22]Did you get it?
[77:49.82]No.
[77:50.33]I just wasn't prepared for it.
[77:53.07]Alright, I'm going home base.
[77:55.95]Close the door.
[77:58.19]Make sure all the windows are locked.
[78:01.69]That scares me more than anything.
[78:03.93]He's gonna come right behind you.
[78:05.77]Okay.
[78:08.10]Okay, where should I go first?
[78:10.04]Probably like four, because... Hang on.
[78:14.16]Why is there a red marker on the screen?
[78:16.99]What do you mean?
[78:18.16]On my map, there's like a tracker marker.
[78:21.78]It's moving away.
[78:22.96]You must have hit it with a tracker.
[78:24.26]Maybe I did.
[78:26.42]Did you have any tracker bullets left?
[78:29.43]Maybe I did?
[78:30.07]I don't know.
[78:32.85]Okay, I'm gonna go try to find the tracked beer, I guess.
[78:36.25]Yeah, and then get a camera for me.
[78:37.75]I'm taking a look at the cameras.
[78:38.71]I don't see anything yet.
[78:50.42]No, nothing.
[78:51.54]Wait a minute.
[78:52.24]No.
[79:05.47]This is like, this is a stressful job.
[79:12.22]Does he only come out at night or something?
[79:14.32]How come we haven't seen him go to any of these baited traps?
[79:16.49]I feel like he does only come out at night.
[79:18.17]Hold on.
[79:19.01]And would they give you a certain amount of time?
[79:20.53]What was that?
[79:22.21]That was me.
[79:22.81]I shot a deer.
[79:23.39]Did you get it?
[79:25.15]Deer is dead.
[79:26.65]Deer is dead.
[79:27.19]We're going to have a lot of opportunities here.
[79:29.34]You're going to be in full opportunity mode soon.
[79:32.68]Unfortunately, I don't have a trap to put next to this.
[79:35.18]I do, however, have a camera.
[79:37.28]Well, that's more important.
[79:39.00]Arguably, that's more important.
[79:40.28]So...
[79:43.79]Okay, new camera.
[79:44.63]Up.
[79:45.39]Ready for you.
[79:45.83]Alright.
[79:48.35]Yeah, there it is.
[79:55.51]Okay.
[79:57.19]Should I heal?
[79:58.01]Like, should I use a med pack to top off?
[80:00.31]I have like 80% health.
[80:02.33]82.
[80:02.55]No, you can take like at least one or two hits with that.
[80:05.05]But my point is, if I heal, he won't be smelling me and like hunting me.
[80:08.93]See what I'm saying?
[80:10.99]You know, that is potentially true.
[80:13.53]And if I die, we have to start the whole game over.
[80:15.93]Yeah.
[80:16.67]Yeah.
[80:18.39]Yeah.
[80:19.21]With that said, I'm going to heal.
[80:21.27]Alright.
[80:28.46]Go for it.
[80:29.24]I'm going to start kind of like in the middle of everything.
[80:31.90]Is it nighttime yet?
[80:32.80]Like what time is it right now?
[80:34.03]It's like 830.
[80:35.73]Okay.
[80:37.41]Well.
[80:38.15]It's like 8 o'clock.
[80:38.97]Yeah.
[80:39.13]It is a little dark out.
[80:44.83]I have very heavy breathing.
[80:57.88]Alright.
[80:59.82]I feel like now it's time.
[81:01.81]It's dark out.
[81:03.15]I'm going to just be cameraman.
[81:05.31]Let's go start with camera one.
[81:06.93]I'm going to shoot him once with a tracker and then get you to come out and help.
[81:12.45]Yep.
[81:14.92]I'm gonna go hard, dude, the second I... Wait, hold on.
[81:20.40]I see a deer.
[81:21.72]Okay.
[81:29.97]I want him to go to one of these traps.
[81:31.23]Why is he not going to any of these traps?
[81:35.41]You just take some time to warm up.
[81:36.95]It's a game of patience.
[81:41.13]I think he does come out at night, though.
[81:44.35]When it's, like, harder to find him.
[81:45.89]Where the fuck is he?
[81:48.35]So you have, like, all day to prepare.
[81:49.93]I mean, we are pretty prepared right now.
[81:52.97]We're pretty prepared, yeah.
[81:54.79]It's about as prepared as we're gonna get.
[81:58.04]It's raining now, too, which makes it even scarier.
[82:02.06]I don't see him anywhere.
[82:03.06]Maybe he left.
[82:08.06]He went to go get some lunch at Denny's.
[82:09.80]He's coming back soon.
[82:12.52]Just wait.
[82:16.84]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if he just appears.
[82:21.62]Like, in my face.
[82:22.50]It's like Five Nights at Freddy's.
[82:29.25]Why does it have to be scary weather when I go outside?
[82:32.09]Yeah, I know, really.
[82:34.63]I want to be back at the RV right now, not walking around with night vision.
[82:46.37]If I hear Bigfoot, I'm just gonna, like, panic, put a camera down so you can, like, watch me fight him.
[82:50.63]So I can see you fight him, yeah.
[82:53.77]Well, I don't see him anywhere.
[82:56.23]Don't worry, he's coming.
[82:57.88]It's just the beginning of night.
[83:01.26]Oh, you know what?
[83:01.82]You know what?
[83:02.18]I made a boo-boo.
[83:03.40]What?
[83:05.14]I think I forgot to cover a couple traps.
[83:07.32]Oh, really?
[83:07.74]Hold on, I'm gonna go back and get mine.
[83:11.44]I'm surprised he hasn't come to this yet.
[83:13.06]This deer carcass.
[83:15.47]Doesn't he love these?
[83:17.07]Where, where, where, where?
[83:17.91]I put the camera down.
[83:20.35]What?
[83:24.13]Did I hit him?
[83:25.73]No, I didn't hit him.
[83:26.61]Where?
[83:27.96]He just ran up behind me and attacked.
[83:30.76]What are you near right now?
[83:32.42]I put the last camera down, so seven, I guess.
[83:35.46]Well, seven, but where are you in regards to?
[83:38.80]I am under one.
[83:39.70]He ran towards somewhere where we have no cameras.
[83:43.44]Oh, God.
[83:45.41]I'm going back to get my camera.
[83:47.15]He got one hit on me.
[83:48.99]Why the hell was he chasing after you?
[83:50.58]I don't know.
[83:51.38]Of all people.
[83:52.38]We have so many wonderful traps with food, and he's just like, I'm gonna fight this guy.
[83:57.60]He's like, I know you put those traps there.
[84:00.74]That's what I think about that.
[84:01.82]Now, I'm about to say, screw the traps.
[84:03.58]Let's just go fire shotguns into this guy.
[84:06.87]Because he finds you, you don't find him.
[84:08.85]It's gonna... It'll be easier if one of us... I'll do the camera if you want.
[84:13.73]If you're happier being out and about, that's fine with me.
[84:15.95]Oh, no, I... I just... I wanna just track him, man.
[84:18.94]I wanna find him.
[84:20.86]If he hits me, like, two more times, I'm gonna die.
[84:22.88]Alright, I'm heading back towards, um... Camera 3 right now.
[84:27.66]Okay.
[84:31.28]And I'm gonna try to cover up the trap.
[84:37.81]He's using hit and run tactics right now.
[84:41.41]He sprints at you and then just like... And then runs away.
[84:45.55]And then when you shoot at him, it scares him away.
[84:50.09]Okay, I'm so surprised that he's not come to the dead, dear.
[84:58.38]Okay.
[84:59.04]I'm at three.
[84:59.74]You're at three.
[85:01.06]Mm-hmm.
[85:03.22]Oh, there you are.
[85:05.86]Okay, covered up.
[85:06.56]He's here.
[85:08.91]He's coming.
[85:09.29]He's got to be around here somewhere.
[85:16.69]I don't see him anywhere.
[85:17.79]I'm not sprinting.
[85:21.41]As soon as I heard that I stopped sprinting, I'm going to try and back up a little ways.
[85:32.85]Is he coming?
[85:33.87]Check the other cameras.
[85:36.02]Check two.
[85:36.52]Yeah, I'm on two.
[85:39.27]I don't see him at two.
[85:40.15]I don't see him at three.
[85:50.32]I don't see him at four.
[85:54.54]He got hurt by something.
[85:55.70]Did you shoot him?
[85:57.06]No.
[85:58.24]Maybe that's what it was.
[85:59.82]Oh, dude, no, no, no.
[86:01.38]He hit one somehow.
[86:03.14]He got to one.
[86:04.04]He hit one.
[86:05.52]That, like, was him getting hit by one.
[86:07.96]Okay.
[86:08.90]Okay.
[86:10.89]I'm chilling at three.
[86:12.78]Should I be going to like two?
[86:15.26]Oh, let me see.
[86:18.78]Yeah, just head towards two.
[86:19.94]I mean, you're in that area.
[86:21.52]Should I sprint?
[86:22.82]Alright, when he roars like that, apparently that means he hit a trap.
[86:26.72]That doesn't mean he's near you.
[86:27.96]Like, that's why we both freaked out and it was like, oh, go to camera three!
[86:34.54]I can't tell if it's better or worse with night vision.
[86:38.08]It's almost the same.
[86:43.57]I just gotta constantly just be moving around.
[86:45.15]I'm heading towards two.
[86:50.17]Yeah, one is Dunzo.
[87:01.49]Thunder.
[87:02.43]This really is Five Nights at Freddy's.
[87:05.54]It is Five Nights at Freddy's.
[87:08.34]Dude, I wish he would go to something.
[87:09.60]Okay, I'm almost to two.
[87:12.18]You're up to two?
[87:13.78]Yep.
[87:14.26]Is two baited?
[87:15.00]Uh, about to find out.
[87:18.48]I have no more bait, if not.
[87:27.69]That was a deer at four.
[87:28.71]Okay, I'm at two.
[87:35.59]Yep, okay.
[87:38.45]Is that baited?
[87:40.84]Uh, I want to say probably because we covered it in leaves.
[87:43.86]Yeah.
[87:46.44]I think so.
[87:48.77]But then again, maybe not.
[87:53.27]I don't think it is.
[87:54.67]If it is, it's like super burned.
[87:56.35]Hang on, let me just turn my flash.
[87:57.47]Yeah, it is.
[87:58.11]Okay.
[87:58.77]It just looks super weird with night vision on.
[88:02.43]Okay.
[88:03.73]Any tips?
[88:04.73]Any tidbits?
[88:06.39]No, I don't see him anywhere.
[88:07.74]I'm going to all the different cameras we have.
[88:09.42]He's nowhere to be seen.
[88:13.21]I'm going to four currently and uh... Not sure what to expect.
[88:21.19]Okay, well... He's gotta show up again.
[88:25.96]I feel like... I feel like he doesn't like our spots at all.
[88:30.82]Cause he's like nowhere to be found.
[88:38.98]MF4.
[88:39.50]He's inside me.
[88:41.50]It might, honestly, it might have something to do with where we have explored.
[88:46.72]Because remember last time we had explored and found like two or three of the dead bodies?
[88:50.44]Yeah.
[88:50.78]It could be like a Slender Man note deal, where the more notes you find, the more prevalent Slender Man becomes.
[88:56.67]So to that end, I'm going to go up and run to the swamp explosion, I guess.
[89:03.99]Because that like triggered an event last time.
[89:08.61]Oh, he's... Wait, what?
[89:09.83]He's here.
[89:10.09]What do you mean he's here?
[89:11.02]He's here.
[89:11.90]Where?
[89:12.12]Where?
[89:12.24]He's on me.
[89:13.68]Where's here?
[89:15.90]I shot him with a dart.
[89:16.96]Come out.
[89:17.18]Oh, you got him with a dart?
[89:18.36]You got him?
[89:18.86]Yeah, I got him with a dart.
[89:20.24]I need to be healed, though.
[89:21.46]I'm coming.
[89:23.79]Where are you?
[89:26.33]Northeast.
[89:27.37]He's running towards the swamp.
[89:28.51]He's in the swamp.
[89:29.39]Yep.
[89:29.83]I got it.
[89:30.92]I'm on the road right now.
[89:33.00]I'm going to be right at the road north of the RV.
[89:34.78]Meet me halfway.
[89:35.26]I got a help pack for you.
[89:36.88]Let's go get this motherfucker.
[89:38.30]You know what I mean?
[89:39.22]I will meet you at the edge of the swamp where the road dips into the swamp.
[89:46.89]I see what you mean.
[89:48.05]Yep.
[89:48.15]Alright.
[89:51.81]He's at the northwest quadrant of the swamp.
[89:58.06]Here we go, guys.
[89:59.42]This is what you came here for.
[90:01.06]I see you.
[90:01.70]I got a health pack for you.
[90:03.75]Can I give this to you?
[90:05.87]I think so, if you hit E. E. All I can do is... It says use medicine.
[90:12.67]That's what I'm saying.
[90:13.79]Maybe if I hit H, it's going to heal me, isn't it?
[90:17.27]Yeah.
[90:17.93]Okay, let's just go.
[90:19.09]Okay, let's go.
[90:20.11]He's coming back this way.
[90:20.93]He's coming back this way.
[90:21.65]He's coming back this way.
[90:22.33]Wait, wait, wait.
[90:23.41]Trap?
[90:24.01]Me?
[90:24.73]I don't have any traps.
[90:25.51]Or me.
[90:27.37]Flashlights?
[90:27.81]Okay, turn them off.
[90:32.81]I think we're just going to have to ambush him.
[90:34.61]Yeah, we are.
[90:34.87]Make sure you've got tracking bullets off.
[90:37.10]Yeah, I've got real bullets.
[90:38.76]Here he comes.
[90:39.16]Okay, let's let him get pretty close.
[90:42.82]Because he's going to run.
[90:43.64]He's going to run the opposite direction of wherever we shoot him from.
[90:46.84]We sprint after him and just fire bullets into his back.
[90:49.22]Okay, he should be invisible now.
[90:51.54]He's coming this way.
[90:53.54]He's coming right towards us.
[90:55.39]Shoot him!
[90:56.07]Shoot him!
[90:59.95]Why is the menu on the screen?
[91:02.94]I'm out of bullets.
[91:03.78]I don't think those did anything.
[91:05.14]Where did he go?
[91:06.16]He went this way.
[91:13.79]He went towards this direction.
[91:15.17]He's up here.
[91:15.99]Do you see him?
[91:18.09]No, he's on the...
[91:21.23]Is he, like, by the lookout?
[91:23.03]He's still going straight.
[91:23.75]He's going by the lookout.
[91:25.50]Oh, you hit him with trackers.
[91:27.74]No, I was shooting bolts.
[91:29.14]He's still tracked from you.
[91:30.62]Oh, really?
[91:31.36]Okay.
[91:32.82]Yeah, that did, like, no damage whatsoever.
[91:34.56]Holy shit, that did nothing.
[91:36.20]Yeah, I hit him at least three times.
[91:38.65]Yeah, we both, like, unloaded on him.
[91:40.05]He's up at, like, the very door.
[91:41.23]He's coming back.
[91:42.37]He's following the road, I think.
[91:44.17]Dude, how are you supposed to kill this guy?
[91:46.87]I don't know, man.
[91:49.42]I guess with traps and bullets and... Alright, get, uh... Get over here.
[91:55.79]He's gonna sprint in this house.
[91:57.47]Hold on, I gotta go get the ammo that should be, uh... In the lookout?
[92:01.31]Mm-hmm.
[92:01.45]Okay.
[92:03.85]Uh, Etalyx, he's gonna be over here in a minute.
[92:06.70]Okay, he cannot hit me.
[92:09.16]Um, when you say he cannot hit you... Does that mean... I will die.
[92:12.38]Does that mean, like, he's coming, like... He's running past us right now.
[92:15.16]There he is.
[92:15.78]He's walking.
[92:16.26]Wait, what?! !
[92:19.36]Oh, I see him.
[92:20.04]He's just, like, strolling along.
[92:23.32]He's just hanging out over there, man.
[92:24.54]He's just walking.
[92:25.34]Alright, being in the swamp is not worth it.
[92:29.07]Run, run, run!
[92:29.79]He's coming for you!
[92:31.17]He's coming for you!
[92:41.90]Look at how much health he has.
[92:45.02]He's so, like, this is gonna take a long time.
[92:49.06]It said 16 bullets to pierce the skin.
[92:51.52]60, wait, maybe after 16 bullets you can hurt him.
[92:54.03]He starts getting, like, weaker.
[92:55.59]Possibly.
[92:55.85]Alright, well, let's go, buddy.
[92:56.71]I used to, I played Left 4 Dead when I was, like, a fucking teenager.
[93:03.48]Oh, that sucks.
[93:05.72]Got stuck in the swamp.
[93:07.68]A friend.
[93:08.90]A shitty friend.
[93:10.32]He just watched.
[93:12.86]Etalyx.
[93:15.04]Hey.
[93:15.40]Here he comes.
[93:18.64]Where is he?
[93:20.06]He's sprinting that way.
[93:22.70]I'm really into the cameraman role.
[93:27.06]Whoa, he's off the map now.
[93:32.82]Oh god, the tracker's gone.
[93:33.76]What the fuck was that?
[93:42.48]That just hurt him.
[93:47.35]Goddammit, Bigfoot, why do you have to have, like, 50,000 HP?
[93:49.41]Uh, so, how are we going to kill him?
[94:04.11]So I think to scare him when we don't want to get hit, I think if you use a flare.
[94:08.57]Really?
[94:08.93]Then it'll make him run away because of the fire.
[94:11.49]Okay.
[94:13.30]So I probably should have done that.
[94:15.32]Good to know.
[94:17.10]So is he no longer being tracked?
[94:19.04]He is no longer being tracked.
[94:24.23]So is there a way for me to like, you're the host, right?
[94:27.79]So you think I could leave the game and come back?
[94:31.75]Oh, it worked!
[94:36.19]He turned immediately around.
[94:39.53]Can you shoot him?
[94:42.37]Well, don't shoot him with the flares.
[94:47.65]He really is scared of the flares.
[94:53.51]But there's only like six flares total.
[94:55.69]Yeah.
[94:55.99]Okay, that does work.
[95:02.90]That was fucking hilarious.
[95:04.72]That had no business working, I know.
[95:09.84]Dude, I'm surprised this does not do more damage.
[95:14.59]That just bounced off of his chest.
[95:17.59]Oh, there's a medicine kit here.
[95:19.89]Yeah, so try leaving and coming back.
[95:22.33]Maybe you'll take the spot of the third person.
[95:23.99]Yeah, I'll try that.
[95:24.89]Let's see if it works.
[95:25.85]Maybe you can take the spot of that potential third person that you can play out of three, you know?
[95:31.32]Because, I mean, if we... This is going to take a long time.
[95:38.21]Getting him to walk in a trap by itself is already, like, extremely difficult.
[95:42.09]Let alone shooting him with a shotgun, like, point blank, does, like, 2% damage to him.
[95:46.67]Okay, let's see if this works.
[95:52.33]I think I cheated the system.
[95:54.07]Let's just cheat.
[95:57.95]Honey, I'm home.
[95:58.97]Did you cheat?
[96:00.31]Yeah, I cheated.
[96:01.13]Nice.
[96:01.77]Cheating works.
[96:02.25]That's good.
[96:05.56]Unfortunately, we gotta use... The guns are limited, don't forget, so... Right.
[96:09.96]I don't have any gear.
[96:11.84]So where do we get the... Where do we get traps?
[96:15.56]We get you to find them at the points of interest.
[96:17.18]I know that there's really well first of all there's still traps available By all the cameras are there enough traps.
[96:23.63]There's a couple more traps to like kill him I Assume so and what like HP does he have to be at where he finally actually gets stuck and we can like rope him up That's a good question, too
[96:44.97]Checking out some of the cams right now.
[96:47.91]Okay.
[96:48.69]I don't think we're going to see them until nighttime, though.
[96:50.41]So we probably should use right now to prepare.
[96:52.03]So I need to go back up to the... I think there's an extra gun at the swamp.
[97:00.12]The guide says to make the traps very far apart.
[97:03.48]We've not really done that.
[97:04.82]I'm going to go pick up one, two, and four.
[97:06.34]I'm going to go pick them all up.
[97:12.39]You've already cheated.
[97:13.19]Just give yourself infinite traps.
[97:15.29]If only we could.
[97:16.99]What about meat?
[97:17.71]Where do we get the meat?
[97:20.21]I don't know.
[97:21.13]Because that seems like a one-time use.
[97:23.97]I think so.
[97:24.61]Maybe not.
[97:25.93]Maybe it's not.
[97:26.81]Maybe just hunt after that?
[97:29.76]Yeah, but there's no way to pull off the deer meat.
[97:33.14]Yeah, well you just use the deer meat as a sort of trap, so you just probably put the trap next to it, and then put a camera near it.
[97:39.99]That scared me.
[97:40.33]I wasn't even prepared for that, to hit dumb fucking deer to sprint by me.
[97:43.71]Alright, anyways.
[97:45.09]We have no more tracking bullets.
[97:46.87]Whatever you've got is all we've got.
[97:49.99]Okay, well here's the camera.
[97:52.80]Where's the trap?
[97:56.43]I kind of wish the traps were on your mini-map too.
[98:01.54]The cabin across the lake.
[98:03.12]That's where I'm going right now.
[98:06.72]Where's the trap on the ground?
[98:08.70]It's over here somewhere.
[98:09.78]I don't even have any idea.
[98:14.40]Can you loot dead players?
[98:15.98]Maybe.
[98:16.36]No, no way.
[98:18.82]Probably not though.
[98:20.12]There's not even like an inventory system.
[98:22.13]No.
[98:23.15]The only inventory is what's at the bottom of the screen.
[98:25.37]Yeah.
[98:31.99]We should shoot each other with tracking bullets.
[98:33.61]So we can see where we are.
[98:35.87]Yeah.
[98:40.63]I know there was another health kit around here somewhere, too.
[98:42.56]Alright, where is this pointing?
[98:49.26]There it is.
[98:49.64]Okay.
[98:51.62]Yeah, so I do have my trap back.
[98:55.24]Oh, jeez.
[98:55.74]Hold on.
[98:56.08]I'll be right back.
[98:59.20]Uh, somebody just gave a hundred bucks
[99:03.14]Hold on.
[99:05.14]Hunter, Hunter Normandy with a hundred bucks says, Jerma, I've been getting over a terribly toxic relationship and your streams have been the funniest shit I've ever seen.
[99:15.09]I love you, man.
[99:16.33]Now find that big hairy asshole.
[99:20.51]Well, Hunter, that's incredibly generous of you.
[99:22.79]Thank you so much.
[99:25.21]That's a lot of money to give somebody.
[99:29.13]But I wish you the best of luck in your relationship woes.
[99:35.40]Pretty sure all of us can relate at some point in our lives, right?
[99:38.40]But thank you so much.
[99:42.51]That's very much appreciated.
[99:47.81]This game is hard as hell.
[99:56.46]Alright.
[99:58.28]I'm back.
[100:01.68]Welcome back.
[100:02.65]Okay, I'm going towards camera six.
[100:04.55]Are we going to leave that one there?
[100:05.55]Do you think that's far enough away?
[100:07.29]I think... Because we've got the whole northwest side of the map that has nothing.
[100:13.43]Yeah.
[100:14.83]We've got to go far away with these.
[100:16.82]Yeah.
[100:18.52]I'm going to pick up camera two.
[100:24.18]I think four and... Which one are you taking?
[100:27.11]Six?
[100:28.05]I'm at six, but I can't remember where the... Oh, there it is.
[100:31.27]Take a pickup.
[100:32.53]Oh, this is the deer carcass.
[100:33.75]It's still here.
[100:34.57]Just leave it then, yeah.
[100:36.33]I'll get four.
[100:36.91]Do you think... Is four alright, you think, or what?
[100:39.88]I think four is too close.
[100:42.22]Okay.
[100:42.46]I'll just meet you at four.
[100:43.80]Alright.
[100:44.16]Let's get four.
[100:47.90]I still have a health kit, by the way.
[100:50.06]Okay.
[100:50.92]I think there's another one on the map somewhere.
[100:52.88]It's probably at the campsite.
[100:56.14]Actually, I might go to the campsite.
[100:57.42]Alright.
[101:00.40]Uh, here's four.
[101:02.94]Where... I did pick up a spare rifle and some ammo, so I'm not completely useless.
[101:09.73]Uh... Where's this trap at four?
[101:12.13]But he still has, like, 85% health.
[101:13.45]Alright.
[101:16.95]There's the camera.
[101:21.15]Where's the trap?
[101:28.52]it's gone where the hell is it um I thought it was like right there oh no it's right here okay alright four is up so six is there three is there I'm gonna go all the way down to the lower right
[101:53.35]Oh, no, I'm gonna go top left.
[101:54.27]Fuck that.
[101:54.75]We've had no luck at all with anything down lower right.
[101:57.33]We're gonna go top left.
[101:58.01]Remember how much he was, how often he would show up?
[102:00.45]He's here.
[102:01.45]Or is he there?
[102:02.37]He sounds like he's close to me.
[102:03.45]I think he stepped in the trap.
[102:05.29]Oh, that must be what it is.
[102:06.71]I think he just stepped in something, yeah.
[102:08.39]I don't think I'm anywhere close to that trap, though.
[102:13.57]But his health is the same.
[102:15.96]Oh, no, that's not far away from me.
[102:22.38]I thought there was something at the camp.
[102:23.84]Have we already been to the campsite this time around?
[102:27.24]I don't remember.
[102:28.26]I'm going to go top left of the mountains and put one there.
[102:34.55]Okay.
[102:40.01]Maybe not.
[102:41.55]Malnourished lost streamer fights big hairy.
[102:47.03]You new to the stream?
[102:47.69]Well, hey, Kyle.
[102:49.32]Hey, Kyle.
[102:50.22]Hi.
[102:50.42]How's it going, Kyle?
[102:51.14]How are you?
[102:53.53]This guy won't learn from his mistakes to look where he's walking.
[102:56.78]Wait, what are you talking about?
[102:58.32]Are you talking about Bigfoot?
[103:01.24]Who could be putting this fresh meat down here?
[103:03.32]No strings attached.
[103:05.32]I know, I told you.
[103:05.86]He's got like the brain of like a fucking field mouse.
[103:08.87]But he knows the trap if you don't cover it up.
[103:11.71]There's cheese in there.
[103:13.71]I want that cheese.
[103:15.41]Yeah.
[103:17.43]I'm gonna get it.
[103:19.32]Ow!
[103:21.22]And he runs.

[103:28.62]What's going on, Kyle?
[103:30.94]Good old Kyle, you know?
[103:32.36]One of the mainstays.
[103:33.74]What's going on, Kyle?
[103:37.78]Someone said, put a tracker in a deer and follow the deer so Bigfoot kills the deer.
[103:43.90]Interesting.
[103:44.32]What's that noise?
[103:44.93]Is that the tree rolling around on top of this thing?
[103:50.61]Okay, well, I did find another trap.
[103:53.79]So I have two extra traps.
[103:55.27]If we find the deer for those traps... I'm putting the shit right here.
[104:00.50]That's the hard part.
[104:01.28]I'm going right here with this.
[104:15.75]Okay, there's a new uh we have a new one.
[104:18.77]It's like up top left over there far enough away from one and I Feel like one five is I mean they're close, but they're not bad closest to the maps not that big No, I think those are not that big like the the road that stretches all the way around the outside is pretty much Yeah, alright.

[104:47.59]I do not.
[104:49.35]Disguise the trap?
[104:50.03]I did.
[104:51.75]We still haven't found all of the dead people.
[104:55.92]Wait, I did cover the trap.

[106:46.60]I couldn't even tell.
[106:47.10]Wait, well, there's the deer.
[106:57.66]Is he running towards you?
[106:59.39]Because he was, like, walking around.
[107:02.61]Well, I'm inside the campers, so...
[107:06.41]Um, I doubt it has anything to do with me.
[107:09.95]Okay, well, I'm gonna put one up here.
[107:12.88]In, like, the swamp.
[107:14.76]Can it go in the swamp?
[107:16.08]It cannot, it has to go on land.
[107:20.02]He must be so confused.
[107:21.20]I mean, wouldn't you be confused?
[107:24.14]I'd be really confused.
[107:26.88]Who, Kyle or Bigfoot?
[107:28.64]I mean, this guy Kyle just came in here and was like, hey man, new to the stream!
[107:32.13]And all of a sudden everyone's like, fucking mod Kyle, Kyle, Kyle.
[107:36.49]He's probably just like, what's happening?
[107:39.05]So we've only found one of the dead campers.
[107:42.94]So what happened to that tree that got set on fire?
[107:47.08]That didn't happen this time.
[107:48.18]Are we in emote only mode right now?
[107:52.22]Is that what happened?
[107:56.66]Is that what we did?
[107:58.88]I think that's what we did.
[107:59.80]I didn't even do it right.
[108:07.17]Is it nighttime yet?
[108:09.53]I don't know.
[108:10.11]Yeah, let's get a game plan here.
[108:12.19]We have a lot of shit spread out.
[108:13.37]Okay, what's camera two for?
[108:16.05]What is it pointing at?
[108:22.04]Is camera two not pointing at anything?
[108:23.44]It's just like by the water.
[108:29.24]Did you put a trap over here?
[108:30.24]Yeah, I think so.
[108:34.36]Two?
[108:34.64]Yeah, there should be a trap by two.
[108:38.84]I guess that's it.
[108:39.89]I don't know.
[108:40.43]I can't see it.
[108:44.61]Let's get a game plan.
[108:46.49]Okay.
[108:47.19]You tell me.
[108:47.73]What's the plan?
[108:48.35]I want to find some of the other dead guys.

[109:39.93]For all you guys know... Oh no, he is here.
[109:43.07]He is still here.
[109:43.69]I was going to say, for all you guys know, he could have just been in here and left.

[114:39.03]Turn right.
[114:40.33]Hard right.
[114:40.79]Yeah, that way.

[114:57.29]Can we just get in the truck and, yeah, just run him over?
[114:59.76]I wish.
[115:00.22]That would be amazing.
[115:00.88]Alright, so now I'm going to... I'm going to go to the truck.
[115:08.11]Okay.
[115:08.61]You want me to go to the truck and guide you around?
[115:10.89]I mean, he's... Is there anything close to six?
[115:13.35]Where's two?
[115:14.61]Two is all the way at the top left.
[115:17.45]I'm right near the truck.
[115:19.27]He probably went to two.
[115:23.17]Bought everyone.
[115:23.85]I would do that if I could.
[115:25.61]Just for fucking fun.
[115:26.99]One day.
[115:30.06]Literal madness.
[115:31.22]Yeah, that was literal madness, but you know, that's what we do here.
[115:35.17]That's how we do it here.
[115:37.69]It was just, it was total madness, but you know, that's the way we roll.
[115:40.65]So you're at the truck?
[115:42.23]That's the way we do it.
[115:43.21]Oh.
[115:45.67]Yeah, I'm right next to the truck.
[115:48.63]What's the game plan?
[115:49.45]The game plan is you and I are gonna find Bigfoot.
[115:54.03]Yeah, well, kinda already done that.
[116:00.01]I actually love how it says that on the side of the truck.
[116:03.38]What, like, that's the game plan?
[116:06.08]Oh, yeah.
[116:06.74]We're gonna find Bigfoot.
[116:08.90]Wait, did we find this person last time?
[116:12.16]Uh, yes, we did.
[116:13.58]We found her in the first person, but not the middle two, so there's still, like, at least two points of interest that we have not found yet.
[116:20.68]Look at these, like, nice... Look at this, like, sexy picture of Bigfoot, you know what I mean?
[116:23.82]Like, that's like a... I'm doing, like, a sexy pose.
[116:27.00]That's, like, the classic one.
[116:28.84]Alright, so you want me to take control or do you want to take control?
[116:32.99]I don't care.
[116:35.45]You can go out in a bat if you think that's more fun.
[116:38.21]Or you can stay here.
[116:41.39]I want to do this.
[116:42.27]I want to see this.
[116:44.15]I feel like it's fun to see him.
[116:47.39]Because it's fun to see through the black and white camera.
[116:50.05]Okay, well, which way should I go?
[116:51.95]Alright, camera 4 is dead.
[116:54.73]Yeah.
[116:55.58]I think that I probably died with it on my corpse.
[116:58.38]Okay.
[116:58.78]When I died the first time.
[116:59.81]Alright, I'm looking at one.
[117:01.09]I don't see anything at one.
[117:01.73]Which way haven't we been that a point of interest could be?
[117:05.95]He was last at two or three, right?
[117:08.51]No, he was at six.
[117:09.53]He was at six.
[117:10.54]Which is between the rivers.
[117:12.36]Okay.
[117:14.30]Or between the lake and the... swamp, I guess.
[117:18.30]Um... Hmm.
[117:23.56]I'm just gonna go for five.
[117:24.84]I'm gonna go towards five.
[117:25.92]Yeah, I'm looking at five right now.
[117:26.98]I don't see anything at five.
[117:40.05]No, I don't see anything.
[117:42.81]Okay, well, he does love to hunt us while we run around at night, so sometimes that's the best way to find him.
[117:50.39]Oh, wait, wait, wait, what was that?
[117:53.58]That has to be on the... The opposite of the direction I ran.
[117:59.39]I don't know where that was.
[118:00.05]I'm trying to skim through cameras.
[118:01.19]Did you find him on the cameras?
[118:02.43]No.
[118:04.57]Usually that means he touches a trap, right?
[118:06.81]Yeah.
[118:07.53]Unless we have somewhere with a trap and no camera.
[118:11.05]I don't think so.
[118:14.82]Why would you hunt for Bigfoot without thermal cameras?
[118:18.52]Good question.
[118:19.48]I know, really.
[118:22.52]I can't answer that.
[118:23.48]I don't know.
[118:26.17]He's straight in front of me.
[118:27.59]Where are you?
[118:29.27]Five?
[118:33.91]I scared a boy.
[118:34.81]You scared him?
[118:35.33]Where are you at?
[118:35.91]Three?
[118:37.35]I shot a flare in the sky.
[118:41.34]He got one good hit on me.
[118:52.85]Where are you standing right now?
[118:55.13]I am east and south of the trailer.
[119:01.48]Just go straight east.
[119:03.68]Yeah, I'm just coming out.
[119:09.16]Without tracking bullets, this seems like it's going to be very difficult to do.
[119:12.60]Ah, that is true.
[119:13.62]It does seem that way, but he did bite.
[119:17.76]He's over by the river to the east somewhere.
[119:20.58]He may have crossed the stream.
[119:22.42]Oh, oh, I see him.
[119:23.74]He crossed the river.
[119:24.94]He's on the other side of the river.
[119:26.16]Like towards, um... Just keep going straight east.
[119:29.99]Straight east, yeah.
[119:31.83]And a bit south.
[119:33.01]Okay.
[119:35.37]Southeast!
[119:35.99]15 minutes low.
[119:42.79]Swimming seems like a bad idea.
[119:54.17]Well, praise the Lord, Kyle.
[119:57.76]I don't see him anywhere.
[120:06.86]Is anyone in chat paying attention to the game?
[120:09.30]At this point, I don't think so.
[120:12.34]Okay.
[120:13.52]I lost him.
[120:14.18]He's gone now.
[120:15.76]Unless he bleeds.
[120:16.56]If you shoot him, will he just drop green blood so you can trace?
[120:19.83]That'd be cool.
[120:23.62]I'm going to put a camera just over here somewhere.
[120:30.78]I think he's really far southeast.
[120:36.31]Is that you all the way down there?
[120:38.67]Yeah, it is.
[120:41.13]I can see your flashlight.
[120:43.63]The draw distance is pretty good.
[120:45.05]Okay, I found some ammo and a signal bullet.
[120:51.69]The game got boring, now chat memes are more fun.
[120:59.47]We're just looking around for big fun and everyone's like... This chat is a different stream.
[121:09.92]Oh, we're in subscriber only now?
[121:11.92]Did it get that out of hand?
[121:14.66]Oh, Jesus.
[121:19.67]Sub only.
[121:20.53]Sorry it had to come to this.
[121:21.97]Alright, where you at?
[121:36.95]I am pretty much all the way at the bottom path.
[121:41.75]If we don't find Bigfoot here in the next few minutes and we don't get this going, then me and you are just doing a TDM.
[121:49.38]It's me versus you, and Bigfoot can join in if he wants.
[121:55.59]I think when I shot the lens flare, it broke my computer.
[122:00.76]Not the lens flare, the flare-flare.
[122:12.05]I kind of wish there were more animals.
[122:14.31]Like, I wish there were more Bigfoots.
[122:16.83]Like, why can't there be, like, a Loch Ness Monster or something?
[122:19.65]Why can't there be, like, a... Like, a big giant gorilla or something.
[122:24.14]Like King Kong.
[122:24.84]How come there's no... Where was that?
[122:30.38]Not like this.
[122:33.42]Is he close to you?
[122:35.14]Because I... Did you hear that?
[122:36.52]I heard that.
[122:39.74]Uh, I don't want to say close.
[122:41.54]It sounded like it was west.
[122:43.38]I bet he hit three.
[122:44.90]I bet if you go to camera three, he's like right in there.
[122:46.80]I mean, I'm walking around right now.
[122:48.76]I didn't see him at all on the cameras.
[122:52.25]So you're on the cameras right now?
[122:54.77]No, I left.
[122:55.89]I came out just because I was just cycling through the middle.
[123:00.37]I'm out walking around.
[123:14.14]So our lifetime ban still ten seconds or does that change well if I say it's a Surprise that's just actually scared the crap out of me alright.
[123:26.85]He ate this deer over here.
[123:27.85]Oh
[123:30.65]I'm having some pretty big frame drops all of a sudden.
[123:32.83]Yeah, me too.
[123:34.65]You are?
[123:35.59]Every now and then.
[123:36.19]Is it like intermittent or is it just constant?
[123:39.20]In my game, it's like 60 frames per second, but my CPU is maxed at 100%.
[123:43.50]Really?
[123:44.50]Uh-huh.
[123:47.92]Might be a memory leak or something.
[123:49.47]Yeah.
[123:58.22]Kyle is a pleb?
[123:59.12]Kyle's not a pleb.
[124:01.15]We don't call people plebs that are named Kyle.
[124:06.89]Kyle never asked for this.
[124:17.12]Pleb.
[124:17.68]What is this?
[124:34.85]Are you ready for TDM?
[124:44.36]Oh, did I lose Etalyx?
[124:48.14]Are you here?
[124:49.36]Am I muted?
[124:49.66]Uh-oh.
[124:54.60]Uh-oh.
[124:56.28]Looks like it's just me.
[124:58.92]It's me.
[125:01.72]Versus Bigfoot.
[125:13.00]I think it's the flares, actually.
[125:14.79]Oh, here, you're back?
[125:17.79]Yeah, I tried turning all my settings down to zero.
[125:19.75]Oh, oh, okay.
[125:21.63]And, uh, still at 100% load.
[125:23.51]Probably a memory leak, because I haven't closed the game this whole time.
[125:28.86]I'm surprised we haven't heard him since.
[125:31.92]Maybe if you're in a game for too long, he just, like, forgets how to be, like, a bad guy.
[125:38.57]Well, we heard him roar over by three and five.
[125:41.17]I think that was the last place he probably was.
[125:44.17]But I feel like he doesn't come out at all during the day.
[125:48.06]So... What I'm trying to say is... Might be a dead game now.
[125:58.79]Did we kill... Hey, we killed Bigfoot.
[126:00.21]He's dead.
[126:02.12]Because we're going to have to wait all the way until nighttime to have a chance at finding him again.
[126:07.74]Alright, so TDM.
[126:10.95]You ready?
[126:11.73]Hold on one sec.
[126:13.95]I don't even have a flare.
[126:35.72]Sunrise.
[126:36.97]Okay, so another day.
[126:38.33]We're doing TDM.
[126:39.27]Yeah, we're doing TDM.
[126:39.83]You have to shoot a flare in the air, though.
[126:42.33]I do, but you don't.
[126:43.39]Because I don't have any.
[126:45.88]I don't have any.
[126:49.00]Okay.
[126:50.16]Shoot a flare, he says to the guy who says, I think flares break my computer.
[126:56.63]So rip stream, basically.
[127:00.44]They can hear me, but they can't see me, so they're just gonna have to rely on the play-by-play to tell who wins.
[127:06.02]I'm sorry.
[127:07.06]It's okay.
[127:07.54]I'm sorry.
[127:09.02]Alright, so I'm at the base of the river.
[127:12.34]I shot the flare already.
[127:13.48]Did you not see the flare?
[127:14.92]I saw it.
[127:15.18]I'm just currently stuck on the right side.
[127:16.96]Okay.
[127:18.02]Nick, I'm shooting.
[127:18.68]Can you see this?
[127:20.12]I heard it.
[127:23.63]I can certainly hear it.
[127:24.53]Alright, can you like... Alright, I heard that.
[127:26.69]That's your one clue.
[127:28.49]You're very close to me.
[127:29.30]I am.
[127:30.12]I wish I could just climb up as the... Uh, I can't like... It's foggy today too.
[127:37.97]Okay, I'm just in like the river rapids.
[127:48.24]Well, that gives me a distinct advantage.
[127:51.02]It does.
[127:52.06]But don't worry, I'm gonna do a turn on you.
[128:04.27]It's like dropping cameras to try to distract you.
[128:06.29]Alright, Marco Polo, you gotta give me a clue.
[128:14.85]That was really close.
[128:32.14]H1Z1 right now.
[128:38.59]Yeah, I almost died.
[128:43.97]Oh, okay.
[128:45.15]I feel better about that then.
[128:47.41]I thought that I whipped all those.
[128:54.70]There's the foundation of a good game here.
[128:56.96]It's just like needs another like a year and a half of development.
[129:00.41]Yeah.
[129:01.95]I like the idea.
[129:02.63]I think it definitely is like a fun experience, but Bigfoot could have like... This is not a $20 game though.
[129:10.34]No, Bigfoot shouldn't have this much health.
[129:13.92]If this was made by like a couple people, highly respect that, but this game is $18 on Steam.
[129:20.26]That's expensive.
[129:24.08]Can Bigfoot just come get me?
[129:25.80]I know he's sleeping right now.
[129:28.10]He takes naps during the day.
[129:29.50]I really wanted to tie him up and drag him through the forest and put him in the fence.
[129:33.51]I know.
[129:33.85]It feels like you've got to do a whole lot of waiting around.
[129:40.97]Yeah.
[129:41.49]They've got the end of the game and there's not enough of the middle of the game yet.
[129:48.25]But it was fun like learning how everything like the tracking bullets and finding the learning how to use the flares.
[129:55.82]It was cool.
[129:57.16]Yeah.
[129:57.36]This would have been a really fun like $5 to $7 game.
[130:01.96]Like $5 game.
[130:03.20]Or maybe like in a year if there's more.
[130:06.10]Yeah.
[130:09.42]But yeah, we are probably giving up on finding the Sasquatch and catching him at this point.
[130:14.54]We're not finding Nemo.
[130:17.77]Maybe another time if they add some stuff and make it more different or substantial.
[130:23.83]Somebody said they want to play Wii Bowling now.
[130:25.61]What?
[130:27.73]I don't have Wii Bowling.
[130:28.45]It's pretty much the same game, don't you know?
[130:30.14]It's the exact same game.
[130:34.18]Free until they fix some more bugs would be nice as well.
[130:38.18]Alright.
[130:38.48]Well, how long have we been streaming for?
[130:41.42]Like two and a half hours, something like that?
[130:43.52]Yeah, about two hours or so.
[130:46.91]Well, is there anything else you'd like to do, my friend?
[130:48.77]Or are you going to want to call it?
[130:50.05]What do you want to do?
[130:51.70]It's all up to you.
[130:53.52]Do you have another game you'd like to play?
[130:55.88]I mean, we could hop into something like GTA if you wanted to for like an hour or something.
[131:02.72]I could certainly try it out unless my CPU is on fire.
[131:05.28]Yeah.
[131:05.68]If your CPU needs a break or something, just let me know.
[131:11.46]Okay.
[131:11.94]Well, I'll get it loaded up and test it out and see how it goes.
[131:15.10]Alright, well, yeah.
[131:15.88]That's it for this particular stream.
[131:17.94]I'm gonna take a pee break.
[131:18.94]I'll be right back.
[131:19.70]Oh, if you're turning off your stream, then I'll turn off my stream.
[131:21.54]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[131:21.94]I mean, like, this particular game.
[131:23.60]Oh, okay.
[131:25.36]So, the stream continues, is what you're trying to say.
[131:27.76]The stream continues for another 45 minutes or so.
[131:31.67]We'll just dick around in GTA or something.
[131:34.87]We're not.
[131:37.73]So, I'll be right back.
[131:38.59]I'm gonna pee.
[131:39.89]Okay.
[131:40.69]Sounds good.
[131:41.17]I will see you all in, like, two minutes.
[131:44.57]I'm just gonna leave this open and see what happens.
[131:46.33]Am I muted?
[131:47.01]Oh, no.
[131:47.17]Am I muted?
[131:47.53]No, I can hear you.
[131:49.17]No, I mean, you can hear me, or... I can hear you.
[131:51.32]And the stream can hear you.
[131:53.08]Oh.
[131:56.02]Oh, wait, you thought that was a secret conversation?
[131:58.07]No.
[132:00.49]Like, Shane, we're going to fight GTA.
[132:02.29]Shh, don't tell them.
[132:03.49]Don't tell anybody.
[132:04.19]I was like, I haven't muted mine.
[132:06.79]Oh, I'm just chilling.
[132:09.62]Alright, I'm going to take a pee break.
[132:11.54]I'm going to leave the game open and up and see if I get hunted.
[132:16.20]Do you think I'm going to get hunted?
[132:18.10]I think you'll get killed really quick.
[132:19.64]Alright, well, we'll find out.
[132:21.18]Okay, I'll be right back here.
[132:57.61]So, we may have a problem here.
[133:08.03]Hello?
[133:10.02]Oh.
[133:11.14]That's all people have been hearing for the last, like, three minutes.
[133:15.96]I did some ASMR for my stream.
[133:18.66]Bigfoot ain't even here right now.
[133:21.08]So, I can't even get GTA to open, really.
[133:25.44]Yeah, I'm having to validate the Steam files right now.
[133:29.46]Okay, well, I'll just keep hunting Bigfoot.
[133:33.23]In the meantime, I'm still here.
[133:35.53]This went on for like ten minutes.
[133:42.97]Yeah, how am I still alive?
[133:44.13]Like, why isn't Bigfoot coming after me?
[133:46.51]I swear he's probably... You know what?
[133:47.89]How come he opened the window that one time and then never did it again?
[133:51.55]He did it in the very first ten seconds of the stream.
[133:53.68]He did it in the first ten seconds.
[133:55.70]That was really cool.
[133:56.82]That was the best part of the whole stream.
[133:58.62]It really was.
[133:59.16]It was the first five seconds.
[134:00.68]Yeah.
[134:04.86]I would agree with that.
[134:08.48]Did my CPU usage go down?
[134:10.70]Yeah, I mean, it did.
[134:11.56]The game by itself has taken up, like, 65% of my CPU.
[134:16.65]I'm telling you right now, dude.
[134:19.01]This game is, you know, early access.
[134:20.67]It's an early game, early development.
[134:23.35]I wouldn't be surprised if he was stuck in a fence somewhere.
[134:27.84]He's just clipped into a mountain, just hanging out there.
[134:33.96]And if that was the case, I wouldn't even be able to kill him.
[134:38.06]Because I have four bullets and there's no melee.
[134:43.69]Take off the tea break.
[134:44.53]Well, we're still kind of in a tea break, right?
[134:57.50]Yeah, I feel like we need to reload the game.
[135:02.44]To make him spawn again?
[135:03.42]To make him spawn.
[135:09.46]He saw that I went on a tea break and he's like, oh, now's my chance.
[135:11.65]I'm going on one too.
[135:21.33]I'm peeing right now.
[135:22.89]I did pee.
[135:27.54]I did pee.
[135:31.64]You did pee.
[135:33.34]You think I could be able to play?
[135:34.45]Actually, you know what I want to try?
[135:42.24]I'm going to go...
[135:45.45]I'm still verifying the integrity of my Steam game files.
[135:49.51]I'm at 40% done.
[135:50.71]GTA is a gigantic game.
[135:53.29]As it happens.
[135:54.56]I think I do need to restart my stream.
[135:56.38]You need to restart your stream.
[135:58.70]Yeah, because I have the... Like, I can't stream GTA on the fast preset, I doubt.
[136:03.16]Oh, really?
[136:04.80]Can you?
[136:05.95]Um, I actually don't even know.
[136:07.01]You use faster, don't you?
[136:08.09]I think so, yeah.
[136:09.53]Okay.
[136:10.33]I mean, I was only going to, I mean, we were only going to play for like, possibly like an hour or so.
[136:14.97]Are you 60 or 50 FPS?
[136:17.05]I'm at 60.
[136:17.25]Okay.
[136:19.31]I'll try it.
[136:19.67]I'm at 60.
[136:21.16]So I'm going to restart real quick.
[136:22.72]Okay.
[136:23.90]See you in a minute, Etalyx.
[136:26.38]While I... I just wanted to see if there was any difference between single and multiplayer.
[136:32.86]Don't think there is.
[136:39.34]But I guess we can just run around in GTA in the meantime.
[136:41.70]Let's take this off.
