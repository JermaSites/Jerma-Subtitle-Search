[00:04.94]Hello, everybody!
[00:06.52]Welcome to episode three!
[00:09.01]Or, uh, Trace.
[00:11.01]Uh, or, um... Those are the only two languages I know how to say three in.
[00:16.63]So I've already fucked this up, and it's been less than ten seconds.
[00:19.86]Like, are you shitting me?
[00:22.18]Whatever.
[00:23.32]So in this episode, I want to talk about the different tactics, different gun combinations, how to use them, why to use them, etc., etc.,
[00:32.83]So I'm using the riot shield in this one right here, and I'm also using the BIG ASS ROCKET LAUNCHER.
[00:40.41]So the reason you want to put these two things on is, well, you don't take any damage, and you shoot rockets.
[00:48.42]This requires no further explanation.
[00:51.72]Excuse me, sir, I think I dropped my wallet over here somewhere.
[00:55.52]Can you please help me find it?
[00:56.62]GET FUCKED!
[00:59.41]They fall for it every time!
[01:01.58]Next up I want to talk about the MG36 and how to properly use it.
[01:06.34]So what you want to do is you want to put on extended mags and rapid fire to be an absolute fucking fire hose of death!
[01:14.34]Just absolutely fucking blow people away with this setup!
[01:17.39]Just crush them!
[01:18.89]This setup is also fantastic for blowing off some steam.
[01:22.49]You know, against your ex-wife.
[01:25.09]Wow Stephanie, you're doing really well, huh?
[01:27.79]Whoa.
[01:28.01]Wow.
[01:28.25]What is this a 2012 look?
[01:28.92]216 early I am actually killing people right now.
[01:34.70]Oh
[01:48.15]Okay, alright, can we shut the fucking dogs up, please?
[01:52.84]So the next tactic that I want to talk about is called camping.
[01:57.32]So what you do is you take your favorite gun and you just lie down in the corner and you just sit there and you can even go make a sandwich and shit.
[02:06.10]That's what I do.
[02:07.74]You know, they don't make turkey sandwiches like they used to.
[02:11.49]This is delicious.
[02:13.12]Oh, oh, shit.
[02:14.24]Oh, don't worry.
[02:15.00]Got him.
[02:15.54]Got him.
[02:16.34]Roger that.
[02:16.94]Got him.
[02:18.22]Oh, hey, Grandpa.
[02:18.99]How's it going?
[02:20.21]You look beautiful tonight.
[02:21.49]What are you guys, what are you doing?
[02:22.51]Something interesting?
[02:23.23]What are you doing?
[02:23.89]Oh, you know, the same.
[02:24.77]Kids are good.
[02:25.63]Husband's good.
[02:26.25]You got kids now?
[02:27.07]Oh, shit.
[02:28.23]Grandpa, they're like 10 and 8.
[02:30.27]Oh.
[02:31.11]Alright, Grandpa.
[02:31.78]Well, I'm going to go up and see if Mom needs any help in the kitchen.
[02:34.60]You be good down here.
[02:35.70]Okay.
[02:36.06]Well, all good.
[02:36.94]Oh, shit.
[02:37.52]Hold on.
[02:38.48]I got him.
[02:39.48]I got him.
[02:39.92]Don't worry, Catherine.
[02:40.68]I got him.
[02:42.36]Oh, this is really bad.
[02:43.94]It has come to our attention that you've been reported by various uses 347 times.
[02:52.50]Oh my god, what did I do?
[02:54.97]What did I do?
[02:55.91]Oh!
[02:55.97]The latest complaint.
[03:00.05]You better cut the shit or I'm going to bare-ass fart in your face.
[03:05.85]I definitely said that.
[03:07.67]Due to the massive amount of complaints, we are hereby terminating the account Jerma.
[03:14.00]Oh my god!
[03:15.42]He is gonna fucking kill me!
[03:19.24]Well, um... I'll see you guys next time, and...
