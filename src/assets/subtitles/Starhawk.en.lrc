[ve:60.16.100]

[00:51.58]Hello.
[00:54.76]Happy Sunday.
[00:57.82]Off-schedule Sunday stream.
[01:00.19]Figured we would play a few things.
[01:04.69]Or at least try to.
[01:05.95]Where's my microphone?
[01:06.91]Why is it migrating over there?
[01:09.43]I don't know.
[01:12.82]Give me a second.
[01:13.32]We will get started.
[01:14.02]Just want to get a couple things set up.
[01:18.18]Enjoy the music.
[01:19.70]See you soon.
[01:46.75]Yeah, this is... I was going to do a Hand of Fate 2 stream.
[01:51.15]But I looked down in my draw.
[01:52.37]And I saw that there were... These were just mocking me.
[01:57.80]There's like four PS3 games.
[02:01.78]That I just lost.
[02:03.74]I never had a plan to play them.
[02:05.46]They're just kind of still here.
[02:08.19]And I just want to be done with them.
[02:10.43]I just want to get through the PlayStation 3.
[02:11.75]This is it.
[02:13.31]This is the end of the PlayStation 3.
[02:17.80]That was like 10 years ago.
[02:20.38]This is not 2006.
[02:21.16]This is the end of our PlayStation 3 stash.
[02:32.42]So don't worry, we'll play Hand of Fate again.
[02:36.83]I got a frog in my throat tonight.
[02:39.37]Can't get it out.
[02:40.15]I tried.
[02:43.23]I didn't even tweet this on Twitter.
[02:47.62]Just a second.
[02:48.36]There we go.
[02:49.08]Hey, look at that.
[03:06.95]Let's move over to the game.
[03:08.83]I'm going to put the headphone in.
[03:14.97]Hey, look at that.
[03:17.36]Right at the cascade of the orchestra.
[03:19.04]That's how I like to do it.
[03:19.96]That's how I do it, you know?
[03:23.00]I don't know if this is... This is stretched out.
[03:26.16]It's the wrong aspect ratio for some reason.
[03:28.24]Maybe that'll change.
[03:34.12]Well, good morning.
[03:35.11]Is it morning, really?
[03:35.61]Where are you?
[03:36.05]It's a long ways away.
[03:48.73]What is that elbow?
[03:49.97]He's like a Ken doll.
[03:53.95]He's an action figure.
[03:58.49]This is not AC Origins.
[04:00.59]We don't speak of AC Origins.
[04:03.87]Here we go.
[04:05.25]Welcome to the end of the PlayStation 3 stash.
[04:06.87]Didn't we play a game that was just like this?
[04:18.29]When the rush kicked off.
[04:20.15]Guy had like green eyes in a game we played like last week.
[04:23.63]Planets that once were wastelands now had men all fighting to stake their claim.
[04:30.32]Looking to strike it rich.
[04:33.40]But those rifts could just as easily make them monsters.
[04:39.50]And that's where we make our money.
[04:41.84]Cutter and I save claims.
[04:44.00]Clean up the jobs others can't.
[04:46.43]We're rift salvagers.
[04:49.23]Mm-hmm.
[04:49.53]Secrets.
[04:49.79]It's just Revolver Ocelot.
[04:51.55]Sounds like him too.
[04:53.07]That's British Revolver Ocelot.
[04:56.83]And British Revolver Ocelot's brother, real Revolver Ocelot.
[05:14.99]Scabs have always been just pests.
[05:17.99]But he's leading them now.
[05:20.19]Banded them together.
[05:22.01]This apparently is a very good game from what I've been told and what I've seen.
[05:27.29]That's why I'm asking.
[05:29.97]Come on back to White Sands, Emmett.
[05:32.03]I'll make it worth your while.
[05:33.35]This is like the new World of Warcraft cutscenes they made.
[05:36.55]They were moving comic books.
[05:40.57]It's cool.
[05:41.23]You got it?
[05:42.42]It's the one, Emmett.
[05:44.38]Some things never fade away.
[05:47.02]They make you who you are.
[05:50.64]Hey, Eamon, thanks for the one dollar.
[05:52.72]Don't jump scare me, frog voice.
[05:54.30]Sorry, we had to.
[05:54.94]Yeah, Warhawk was the prequel to this.
[05:56.42]Well, this is the sequel to Warhawk.
[05:58.24]This came out after, right?
[05:59.02]You get your deal, Emmett.
[06:12.20]How fun is this game?
[06:14.80]That's Steve Blum, by the way.
[06:19.19]I just need to hear him say one word, and I know who it is.
[06:23.43]Dust Mining Site 17.
[06:25.67]And it is not the right aspect ratio.
[06:28.94]It looks like this on my screen, too.
[06:31.44]Hold on.
[06:32.16]Told you.
[06:40.88]Let me fix this for you guys, at least.
[06:42.60]This looks like mine, too.
[06:46.88]Let's go like this.
[06:47.72]We just have to finagle it around a little.
[06:51.91]Hold on.
[06:52.25]Bear with me.
[06:54.91]Oh, Lord.
[07:00.85]And this is too much over here.
[07:02.57]No, that's right.
[07:05.18]That's correct.
[07:05.92]That's correct.
[07:08.36]That's correct.
[07:12.65]Is it correct over here?
[07:14.69]Yeah.
[07:15.55]What about, ah, it's not correct down.
[07:21.45]God damn it.
[07:24.49]I know this is going to bother somebody.
[07:26.01]I can tell you right now.
[07:26.92]You're like, oh, Jeremy, why are you doing this?
[07:28.42]This is going to bother somebody.
[07:30.36]Somebody's going to come into the stream and be like, what's with this fucking aspect ratio?
[07:35.00]We should strangle this guy.
[07:36.62]And I'm going to be like, please don't.
[07:38.48]I'm trying to fix it.
[07:41.19]That's good enough.
[07:42.23]Got it.
[07:42.81]Okay.
[07:45.33]Look, it's good enough.
[07:47.99]Good.
[07:49.14]That's good.
[07:53.18]Good enough.
[07:53.84]Here we go.
[07:57.62]So, very first thing you gotta do here is R and L is move around.
[08:01.54]I get to go on a bike.
[08:04.67]Drive to the work site.
[08:05.99]Alright, let's get on this.
[08:06.77]Let's get on.
[08:07.31]How do we drive?
[08:07.91]Like this.
[08:09.79]We gotta follow Tracy.
[08:12.68]Anything else I need to know?
[08:14.52]This is kinda cool.
[08:15.20]Exit's a jump?
[08:16.46]That was a pretty close cut there.
[08:17.74]My eyes!
[08:18.14]Okay, well, I didn't know he... I didn't know he was gonna get off his bike.
[08:21.32]R1 is shoot?
[08:21.94]Oooh, I like it!
[08:22.66]R1 is shoot, not R2!
[08:23.54]Not R2!
[08:44.38]Ammo boxes replenish weapons.
[08:51.06]Anything else I need to know?
[08:55.17]This is Destiny 2.
[08:55.71]This is not like Destiny 2.
[08:59.57]That's not good.
[09:00.15]That's R2.
[09:00.49]Let's get back on there.
[09:03.49]This is just a tutorial that is teaching us how to use things.
[09:07.94]I probably can't even die in the tutorial, so don't worry.
[09:12.69]In fact, I guarantee you can't die in this tutorial.
[09:14.58]Let's try.
[09:15.02]Nope.
[09:18.84]We are alive still.
[09:22.02]Select weapon.
[09:22.64]Got different weapons.
[09:25.16]Don't have any ammo for this gun.
[09:26.10]Is there an aim down sights?
[09:30.23]Yes, there is.
[09:35.09]No, that's... Okay, wrong button again.
[09:41.00]Red Faction and Red Dead Redemption.
[09:46.72]Didn't he say... Oh, yeah, yeah.
[09:47.74]Reload is square.
[09:48.52]That's good to know.
[09:50.90]This looks like Defiance.
[09:53.96]Hey, don't shit... We don't... We can't... Look, all these PS3 games are old.
[09:58.18]But we're not allowed to shit talk them.
[10:00.22]We have to give them at least 20 minutes each.
[10:02.70]That's the only way we're allowed to shit talk.
[10:06.34]Drive to the work site.
[10:07.16]Alright, let's keep going.
[10:09.27]Take a shortcut.
[10:12.21]This looks like a pretty good shortcut to me.
[10:16.52]I was expecting game over, game failed.
[10:19.66]But I guess... How far can we go?
[10:24.62]Did they... No.
[10:26.31]Leaving area.
[10:27.03]It's battlefielding me right now.
[10:28.73]Okay.
[10:30.93]That's fine.
[10:35.93]Get up there.
[10:36.37]Come on.
[10:39.54]Oh, shit.
[10:40.22]No, no, no, no, no.
[10:40.78]Get on it.
[10:47.05]Okay, I went kind of a strange way.
[10:49.13]But I made it.
[10:51.92]Where do I need to go?
[10:52.68]The square, right?
[10:58.26]How am I still on this?
[11:01.08]Hey, I made it!
[11:02.90]How do I do the tutorial again?
[11:04.18]Crouch?
[11:05.34]I'm in the middle of everybody.
[11:07.42]Wait, I said you couldn't fail the tutorial.
[11:08.82]Don't do it now.
[11:11.38]Alright, I can just crouch here and I'll get plus 10 HP a minute.
[11:15.62]I'm good.
[11:18.31]I'm getting lost in the tutorial.
[11:20.73]No, I'm not getting lost.
[11:22.47]I'm taking the scenic route.
[11:25.80]Look, if anybody ever makes fun of you for being lost, you want to know the easiest way to make them feel bad about it?
[11:33.28]Like, dude, where are you going?
[11:34.34]You're supposed to turn around and go the other way.
[11:37.01]And you're like, dude, I fucking paid 60 bucks for this game.
[11:40.48]I wanna see the area.
[11:42.39]I wanna explore and see what the developers intended me to see, you know?
[11:46.36]And they'll just think you're a weirdo completionist.
[11:49.56]And they'll shut up.
[11:53.95]They'll be like, oh, okay, he's like one of those super completionists.
[11:56.90]He wants to see all the architecture.
[11:59.00]I could stand here like this, and you guys would just think I'm lost or something.
[12:02.30]I could be like... No, I just want to see, like, I'm interested in, like, Unity assets and, like, Unreal assets.
[12:08.26]I'm just checking out, like, the asset.
[12:10.51]And the person will think you're smart.
[12:11.57]They'll be like, holy shit, wow, this guy's fucking smart.
[12:13.65]I don't even know what he means by that.
[12:16.47]What does he mean by that?
[12:17.35]Did I throw it in there?
[12:22.25]No, there's this one guy over here.
[12:28.59]Secure the worksite.
[12:30.05]Is the worksite destroyed?
[12:31.32]It's this right here, isn't it?
[12:35.14]No, there's one more.
[12:36.00]One more group of bad guys.
[12:40.84]Any melee?
[12:43.18]Yeah, what?
[12:45.24]You stab to the side.
[12:47.49]Alright, I need to try that on somebody.
[12:50.67]You just don't look and you slash to the right.
[12:52.43]That's fine.
[12:56.47]Oh, it just does an animation.
[12:58.27]Come on!
[12:59.89]The guy right below me.
[13:05.69]Achievement!
[13:07.05]I must have been doing something right!
[13:08.29]Oh, actually, he's gonna climb up and... Got him.
[13:15.17]I win.
[13:17.14]Tutorial complete.
[13:24.46]Achievement.
[13:27.22]It's a trophy.
[13:28.52]It's an achievement.
[13:31.54]Doesn't matter what you want to call it.
[13:33.26]This is it.
[13:33.84]You achieved it.
[13:34.70]Our first main character death.
[13:37.33]Are we supposed to care about that guy yet?
[13:39.49]That guy actually is dead.
[13:41.67]Oh shit.
[13:58.57]Hold to build a battle menu?
[14:04.69]What the fuck is this?
[14:09.22]What?
[14:16.76]Alright, there's a build menu?
[14:18.06]What is this, an RTS?
[14:25.07]We didn't even pull that guy out.
[14:26.51]We dropped this on top of...
[14:29.66]Are we gonna take his shoes, too?
[14:33.14]And then go on a quest to find a wizard and then click our heels three times and go home?
[14:37.30]That was the Gizzard of Oz, if you didn't know.
[14:42.30]Alright, we gotta build something over there, too.
[14:46.25]Watch out for the meteors!
[14:47.03]Watch out for the meteors!
[14:48.47]Oh.
[14:50.41]We just can't.
[14:52.37]Imagine that's the end of the game.
[14:55.77]I'm gonna destroy these.
[15:00.42]This is your resource to build.
[15:01.92]Okay, so are those on the map?
[15:07.43]This is just red faction.
[15:08.85]So what do you want to do?
[15:11.19]You want to build a turret.
[15:14.07]Oh, god damn it.
[15:14.83]I keep doing that to sprint.
[15:15.91]I'm going to die with that.
[15:17.67]Alright, let's go.
[15:20.26]Supply bunker.
[15:22.48]What is it?
[15:23.06]Right here, right?
[15:27.12]That's where he wants it.
[15:27.74]That's where he's going to get it.
[15:35.37]Oh.
[15:37.19]Wait.
[15:38.35]I think that might not have been the right place to do it.
[15:40.41]I think I have to press triangle here.
[15:43.65]Uh, reclaim supply bunker.
[15:54.78]Well!
[15:58.36]Whoops!
[15:59.46]Apparently I wasn't supposed to do it like that.
[16:01.36]I just wasted like 400 million dollars.
[16:10.11]Let's drop the building on myself.
[16:15.57]Where's this last guy?
[16:16.31]Can I ram people?
[16:18.41]Yeah, I can.
[16:19.39]Let's do this.
[16:20.29]Let's go on a ram page.
[16:21.99]You know what I'm saying?
[16:25.87]Can you not hit people?
[16:32.42]You can't... Really?
[16:33.74]Oh, wow.
[16:34.90]This game could have been a much better score than it is.
[16:40.53]No, don't get on the fucking sidewinder again.
[16:42.71]Get off.
[16:45.73]Look, I just want to see the scenery.
[16:47.57]Look at how, like, whoa, dude.
[16:48.75]I'm gonna do a color scheme, that is, so I can do that in fucking Unreal when I make my game.
[16:53.44]This guy's fucking smart.
[16:58.28]He's, like, checking.
[17:00.92]He's checking?
[17:01.92]On the assets.
[17:03.29]I wish I was as intelligent as he is.
[17:09.33]Alright, build another thing.
[17:11.33]We're building a wall.
[17:14.17]Alright, get it out.
[17:14.95]Get it out.
[17:15.41]Get it out of your system, everybody.
[17:16.65]Get it out.
[17:17.91]Go ahead, get it out of your system.
[17:28.76]Okay, you can do it.
[17:31.70]Everybody wanted me to... Oh, goddammit.
[17:34.44]Everybody wanted me to do that, and it did.
[17:36.18]It works.
[17:40.04]Okay, good thing it starts right here.
[17:41.48]Can I drop it on other people?
[17:42.76]That's the real question.
[17:47.22]And it's all union made.
[17:49.18]Okay, here we go.
[17:50.98]Let's drop this on this guy.
[17:53.49]Is this going to work?
[17:56.23]Is Willard and Tracy both going to die right now?
[17:59.11]Place your bets.
[18:01.85]No, it won't let me do it.
[18:03.21]I have to actually do the tutorial.
[18:04.99]Oh, that's a pain in the ass.
[18:05.79]I don't want to actually do the fucking tutorial.
[18:08.23]Send down a wall cutter.
[18:15.39]Defending.
[18:17.27]Could you just fight against waves of enemies in this game?
[18:21.60]Are we playing Fortnite?
[18:25.44]Is this where they got the idea?
[18:31.02]Probably.
[18:40.31]Yeah, those guys were... Wait, wait, wait.
[18:42.43]Those guys were standing up there.
[18:44.41]Can I just drop them?
[18:45.29]I'm gonna be able to drop them.
[18:48.99]They're supposed to be defending this place.
[18:50.59]Will this guy stop dropping down the structures?
[18:55.60]It is Fortnite.
[18:57.64]It actually is.
[19:02.62]When do I get my piñata?
[19:07.79]So we're gonna put something up here we have to put up a building auto turret I'm gonna need some firepower ready up the auto turrets A lot of buildings in this game apparently Alright auto turret one Auto turret two.
[19:30.58]I don't I want to like spin this around a little Is there how do I rotate?
[19:39.76]I thought I was going to let it hit me, didn't you?
[19:40.92]Alright, another one?
[19:42.38]Put another wall.
[19:46.22]Alright, just put another wall down.
[19:47.88]It's more of like a revolving... That's more of a swiveling door.
[19:52.56]Alright, there we go.
[19:55.38]Now I'm going to get up here.
[19:56.18]Oh, I fucking blew my deep end pool dive.
[19:59.43]Here they come.
[20:00.93]What do these mean?
[20:06.51]Oh, that's what that means.
[20:13.15]Look at those turrets.
[20:13.77]Look at that.
[20:14.15]That can crouch behind walls and shit.
[20:18.13]They're killing each other.
[20:18.97]I don't have to do anything.
[20:25.29]Wait, I can go... Wait, wait, wait.
[20:26.23]What?
[20:26.64]Just use that tactic.
[20:28.96]That's a pretty good tactic.
[20:30.82]It's going to land right here, right?
[20:32.28]Just drop it right on top.
[20:34.72]Holy shit, that's so much better.
[20:37.42]Forget about actually fighting enemies.
[20:38.96]Just wait until they build and then build on top of their building.
[20:42.69]And you'll crush their building and kill everybody inside.
[20:44.64]That's pretty genius.
[20:52.04]I think we're good.
[20:55.88]Anybody else?
[20:56.94]That looks like the last of them, Cutter.
[20:58.32]There's not a scabbing sight.
[21:00.55]That's how you earn a paycheck.
[21:05.38]God damn it.
[21:05.62]I'm just making platforms.
[21:06.14]Oh.
[21:06.25]I actually like it like this.
[21:07.17]I bet this guy watches Rick and Morty.
[21:09.21]No way.
[21:09.61]This is my territory.
[21:10.61]If there's a horde of them up there, I would know about it.
[21:33.08]Hey, Papa Shady.
[21:34.18]Thanks for the $1.
[21:35.39]Good morning from Australia.
[21:36.53]Good morning.
[21:39.25]And also thank you to Cult of Personality 47 for the $1.
[21:44.07]You've been helping me with my depression for a while now.
[21:47.95]You are a joy to watch.
[21:49.02]Keep up the good work.
[21:49.78]Thanks.
[21:50.00]Well, thank you, Cult of Personality.
[21:54.94]Like I say, I got and I just... I can't help it.
[21:58.28]I press L2 to run.
[21:59.84]R2.
[22:00.34]It's never R2.
[22:01.14]It's always L2.
[22:05.75]Everything being on the right side.
[22:07.53]Why are they not utilizing the left side?
[22:10.66]L1?
[22:11.20]Excuse me.
[22:11.94]R1 is shoot.
[22:12.82]R2 is sprint.
[22:13.70]No.
[22:14.14]In Call of Duty, my favorite game, it's L3.
[22:16.84]Come on.
[22:19.22]But... Call to personality.
[22:23.39]Thank you for the kind words.
[22:29.05]Depression's not fun.
[22:33.91]So hopefully you can, uh, hopefully eventually you can start to feel a little bit better.
[22:38.90]Because it sucks.
[22:40.92]I'm supposed to be driving.
[22:44.06]It's too late.
[22:44.66]Oh, goddammit, I'm walking.
[22:48.70]Am I actually?
[22:49.96]Wait, I'm walking the wrong direction.
[22:53.41]Wow.
[22:56.81]The animation technique here is actually pretty interesting.
[22:59.98]They wanted to go, like, back and forth with it.
[23:01.94]Animator took a long time for that.
[23:03.04]These rocks, too.
[23:03.62]I have to check those out in the store.
[23:08.90]Hmm.
[23:14.71]These, like, fall trees, huh?
[23:17.41]Nice.
[23:20.97]Sometimes you just, like, gotta take it in, you know?
[23:23.35]Alright, what was that?
[23:24.11]I'm gonna just... And I gotta drive to the depot, right?
[23:31.49]Can I just build a car?
[23:33.67]Oh.
[23:34.87]I can.
[23:42.11]My motion blur.
[23:43.49]Can this guy get on?
[23:44.62]Can I drive this guy too?
[23:45.50]Let's go.
[23:46.54]Come on, Tracy.
[23:48.74]Oh, forget it.
[23:54.78]And I can weave around my traffic pattern I made.
[23:57.77]Great.
[24:00.12]Drive to the fuel depot.
[24:01.70]Where is it?
[24:03.28]Why is this marked on my map?
[24:06.10]This is marked here.
[24:06.88]This is the fuel depot.
[24:08.14]Why is this marked?
[24:12.58]I'd like to get in there.
[24:13.46]Alright, I wasn't listening.
[24:22.65]Is there a map in this game?
[24:28.11]What's the map?
[24:28.83]There it is.
[24:29.23]Drive to the fuel depot.
[24:35.21]Do you guys see this on my map?
[24:36.51]I don't understand.
[24:40.99]Just drive straight?
[24:49.81]What am I missing here?
[24:52.15]I wasn't listening.
[24:55.89]Point this way.
[24:56.59]Fuel depot, pointing this way.
[25:01.68]See?
[25:01.92]There's arrows here.
[25:05.89]Yeah, these scabs are all over the place.
[25:07.33]Ah, see, I know where that was.
[25:08.03]Reminds me of... Oh, back on Reach?
[25:12.57]What happened?
[25:15.55]What warning?
[25:16.07]What's what warning?
[25:16.93]What do you mean warning?
[25:19.37]Why am I getting hit by missiles?
[25:25.81]That guy killed me?
[25:28.09]That random guy?
[25:30.93]Across the map?
[25:33.84]That guy better get a fucking promotion.
[25:36.42]Holy shit.
[25:44.97]View objectives and map.
[25:54.19]You know, that's great.
[25:57.06]Drive to the field depot.
[25:58.30]Was I going the wrong way?
[26:09.28]Because I don't see this anywhere.
[26:15.76]Can I get somebody to help me?
[26:21.28]Well, let's build this.
[26:29.89]You think I need to kill the rocket guys?
[26:31.53]Really?
[26:39.67]Go ask the guy for directions.
[26:42.23]Got full ammo.
[26:43.04]I definitely don't have to go this way.
[26:50.22]No.
[26:50.68]In any video game that has a car, it's the reverse of how it's like when you drive a real car.
[26:56.20]It was the way I was going.
[27:01.51]Well, okay.
[27:03.11]So I have to, like, snipe this guy?
[27:04.67]Okay.
[27:07.19]Fuel Depot, right?
[27:09.03]So what's the story here?
[27:10.35]How come I was getting lit up?
[27:18.02]I'm so scared right now.
[27:22.22]It says warning.
[27:29.87]Is the multiplayer up still?
[27:31.59]I don't know.
[27:32.15]It might be.
[27:32.57]I don't think so.
[27:36.70]Where is he?
[27:40.98]Well, I'm definitely too far away.
[27:50.03]Come on, man!
[27:57.01]You can do it!
[27:58.79]Wait!
[27:59.17]Wait!
[28:02.05]Easiest thing I've ever done.
[28:04.53]Okay, now I can think.
[28:07.60]Now let's build another car.
[28:12.94]Okay.
[28:17.48]Now, one, two, three, go!
[28:24.26]Good luck catching up with me here.
[28:28.82]Use the assets to your advantage.
[28:30.39]Fuel depot's right there.
[28:31.49]I win.
[28:41.50]Got him.
[28:55.02]No, he's not dead.
[28:56.16]How much health do you have?
[28:57.64]Alright, I win.
[29:01.08]Sometimes you gotta stop and see the assets, you know what I mean?
[29:09.99]Damn it.
[29:11.47]It's alright.
[29:11.95]It's right.
[29:12.25]It's over here.
[29:12.71]I think there's a fuel depot You got a new gun this looks like a fuel depot Where's that fuel depot?
[29:36.89]There we go.
[29:37.41]Fuel Depot.
[29:40.41]Found it.
[29:40.97]This is what I was looking for.
[29:50.72]Why is it not on my map?
[29:55.02]I gotta build the command center in there.
[29:56.78]Okay.
[30:00.56]The green diamond?
[30:01.44]The green diamond is the original place we were in.
[30:08.27]Let's put the command center in here.
[30:17.50]Can I build this in here?
[30:24.47]I don't think this goes here.
[30:28.50]So you're trying to tell me that the thing I had to touch was the thing inside.
[30:32.04]Inside of the... I tried to do something to it.
[30:35.38]I couldn't do anything to it.
[30:36.09]It's a drive.
[30:36.97]It wanted me to drive eight feet to my left.
[30:44.01]No, the fuel depot was like being pointed over here.
[30:45.90]This looks like a fuel depot.
[30:58.13]You were going the right way until you fell off a cliff.
[31:01.85]Well, I gotta go back here then.
[31:07.57]It's like over here.
[31:14.28]You know what?
[31:14.82]You know what?
[31:17.64]We're not gonna fucking do something stupid this time.

[31:52.75]Fuel depot.
[31:54.88]Look, there it is.
[31:56.12]Over here.
[31:56.84]Just go this way, cross the bridge, and go to the fuel depot.
[31:59.42]World record faith.
[32:00.52]Scabs.
[32:20.47]Not gonna actually kill me, right?
[32:22.81]This guy's aim is fucking incredible.
[32:24.65]Like, it just is.
[32:25.35]This guy's aim is too good.
[32:28.54]I feel like I'm gonna die.
[32:30.22]Oh shit, I am!
[32:35.68]I'm dead.
[32:36.74]Oh, I'm dead!

[32:58.09]We're safe.
[33:03.87]Where is he?

[33:29.80]Okay.
[33:30.38]Easy.
[33:36.12]This way.
[33:39.25]And then here comes the bridge.
[33:41.81]Don't do anything stupid on the bridge.
[33:44.39]Just go across it like a normal human.
[33:47.55]Fuel depot.
[33:50.27]Hey, look at that.
[33:50.97]Found it.
[33:52.13]There it is.
[33:52.81]Fuel Depot.
[33:56.77]It's gone.
[33:58.41]Where the hell are you idiots?
[34:10.78]Just spray.
[34:12.04]Okay, if you hold down too long, you can't shoot.
[34:13.90]Is the Animaniacs tower shooting at me or what?
[34:18.76]Or is it just these two guys?
[34:23.95]I'm gonna build like a... You know what?
[34:24.85]Let's build a turret over there.
[34:28.65]Give me a hand.
[34:29.33]Wait, what do you mean chat was wrong?
[34:33.82]Chat was wrong?
[34:36.90]What were they wrong about?
[34:40.80]Oh god.
[34:41.30]I actually do have to build like a bunch of shit here.
[34:43.04]Build like a bunch of turrets.
[34:43.90]Build like three of them.
[34:48.72]And build a fucking rift extractor.
[34:50.51]I need these.
[34:54.08]Alright, I got any more?
[34:55.44]Okay, I got enough for a wall.
[34:58.84]No, I don't want that.
[35:01.87]Dead.
[35:02.09]It's not that hard when you start to use your brain power.
[35:09.69]Secure the fuel depot.
[35:10.77]I got my double turrets.
[35:14.64]This can't be used.
[35:15.38]I thought it could be used.
[35:20.44]I need to put down a dispenser.
[35:25.25]No, we're not nexting yet.
[35:27.11]Not yet.
[35:28.25]There is some potential here, and we're not gonna... This game's cool.
[35:34.76]Cool, man.
[35:37.10]This game's cool, man.
[35:37.84]Now that I added airplanes, you don't think I'm gonna want to get in an airplane.
[35:47.28]Now, what do I need to do?
[35:49.62]I have 29 seconds to do what, exactly?
[35:53.31]Get in a plane.
[35:54.45]Build a plane.
[35:56.07]Build a plane.
[36:00.53]Not sure.
[36:01.00]16 seconds.
[36:02.74]Are they blowing this place up?
[36:10.42]8 seconds.
[36:10.72]5 seconds.
[36:15.76]2 seconds.
[36:21.92]This is when they come in and they destroy the bridge.
[36:24.97]They fly under the bridge.
[36:27.05]Everyone used to do that in Star Fox.
[36:28.21]What was that first Star Fox level?
[36:29.83]Star Fox 64.
[36:31.01]You had to get that ring that was underneath that bridge there, like the overpass.
[36:33.87]It was so hard to get.
[36:34.73]Watch this.
[36:48.56]Easy.
[36:53.46]It's like SAM sites from Red Alert.
[36:55.02]They'll do fine.
[36:55.69]I'm not very good, as you can tell.
[37:03.63]I'm not very good.
[37:05.19]I need to turn my, like, controller sensitivity up to kill these giant bats.
[37:21.22]You telling me you don't want to wait for me to get to drive one of these?
[37:28.01]You guys don't want to see that?
[37:31.05]Are you sure?
[37:31.57]And this turret isn't doing anything.
[37:40.05]I got an idea.
[37:41.37]I got to get up a little higher.
[37:45.32]Watch this.
[37:46.81]Destroy these gonna get the gonna get the shit.
[37:48.75]We're gonna go up here.
[37:49.31]We're gonna build a turret up here on top.
[37:51.27]I don't have enough for a turret.
[37:56.34]Can I build a wall on top of the wall?
[37:58.98]No, I can't.
[38:02.48]Okay, well I need to... I'm just putting them... I'm putting myself in an easier place for them to shoot.
[38:09.08]That's all I did.
[38:10.20]I did not do anything else.
[38:11.80]I'm just waiting for the turret to come around.
[38:20.26]Sign me up for the resistance.
[38:21.66]I can do it.
[38:31.67]Sign me up for the resistance.
[38:33.87]I'll show you.
[38:35.19]I'm really good at the shoot the water into the hole game.
[38:42.76]You guys don't understand what I'm talking about?
[38:43.78]You know the fireman game that's at the arcade where you shoot like into the tiny hole?
[38:48.82]I can do that real well!
[38:54.40]This one's almost done.
[38:58.96]This is burning.
[38:59.66]Is there any other weapon I have that's better for this?
[39:02.82]Not really.
[39:06.31]I just have to sit here and do this.
[39:12.03]There's not a better way for me to do this.
[39:23.86]I didn't even need to do that all you guys had to do is fly in the correct path I Would have died you could have the mission would have been a success Did it take did it take one away to the other one crashed
[39:46.02]Alright, just get out of here.
[39:47.05]Get out of here.
[39:50.81]Go.
[39:51.21]Bye.
[39:59.07]Holy shit.
[39:59.87]Will you please die?
[40:09.92]Where is it?
[40:11.54]Where is it?
[40:13.14]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[40:13.72]What do you mean?

[40:31.27]Camera settings.
[40:32.69]Camera sensitivity.
[40:39.37]Okay.
[40:40.85]Okay.
[40:42.05]Now I can, like, I can... No, that didn't do anything.
[40:52.93]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[40:58.69]Finally!
[41:02.46]Alright, now what do I win?
[41:03.64]Some cool stuff?
[41:06.90]Actually, worse.
[41:14.32]We're not done until I get to fly a plane.
[41:15.99]Settle down!
[41:18.11]Got your new home, scab?
[41:29.06]What's happening?

[42:07.39]This crystal is going in my butt.
[42:08.35]What?
[42:24.04]How long should we give this before I get in a plane?
[42:27.91]Oh, shit.
[42:28.89]I don't know about the next one, though.
[42:30.19]The next one might be way too boring.
[42:31.53]It's alright.
[42:33.39]Hey, Styx, thanks for the $1.00.

[45:52.94]This guy right here.
[45:53.70]Watch this.
[45:58.44]Dodged it.
[45:59.02]See that?
[46:03.84]Alright, gotta fly like a pilot.
[46:05.14]Remember, it's up and down.
[46:06.16]Up is down and down is up.
[46:11.73]Wait, what am I doing?
[46:12.37]What happened?
[46:22.93]I think I just, like, I was going so fast.
[46:26.62]I was going so fast down that I burnt up in the atmosphere.
[46:29.78]Alright, get him!
[46:33.75]Come on, there's actual atmosphere in this game, and it locks on.
[46:36.31]Auto-target.
[46:37.13]Beautiful!
[46:40.89]Yeah, there's actual atmosphere.
[46:46.60]R2 is break.
[46:49.88]Alright, where's the next thing?
[46:54.22]So don't press circle under any circumstances, or square.
[46:58.96]Wait, look at this.
[46:59.54]There's, um... What does it say?
[47:02.64]Blue lane.
[47:04.86]Investigate the asteroid cluster.
[47:06.40]Wait!
[47:09.12]Okay.
[47:10.14]Investigate.
[47:11.18]Do I get some tools?
[47:11.88]Do I get investigating tools?
[47:17.13]I like that.
[47:17.63]I like doing a boost into the spin.
[47:20.39]And it's a backflip too.
[47:23.69]Swarm lasers.
[47:24.47]Okay.
[47:26.45]What do I do about that?
[47:27.53]I know.
[47:27.85]You go rat-a-tat-tat.
[47:29.09]Rat-a-tat-tat.
[47:31.23]Deploy flares.
[47:35.20]Alright, so flares block that.
[47:43.30]Evasive, yeah, I know.
[47:44.36]This really is Star Fox.
[47:53.00]That's okay, I'll time it.
[47:56.55]Oh shit, I burnt it out.
[48:00.95]Power slide, L2.
[48:04.48]What do you mean, powerslide?
[48:11.98]I just, like, did a backflip again.
[48:13.96]Alright, here we go.
[48:14.66]This is how you dogfight.
[48:16.48]I learned a lot.
[48:20.92]I learned a lot from... I watched Dunkirk.
[48:23.78]And now I know how to fly a plane.
[48:28.43]It's like this.
[48:28.85]You wanna know how to fly a plane?
[48:34.51]Oh, I get hit by every single one of those.
[48:43.01]Got it.
[48:47.13]From every movie I've ever seen.
[48:51.35]Oh, I can't do it yet.
[48:52.38]Kind of awkward controls, though.
[49:00.30]Where's my missile?
[49:04.61]Left and right is up and down is fuel-conducing.
[49:09.90]How do people do this in real life?
[49:10.94]Boost it up!
[49:22.80]I watched a movie about some of the worst maneuverable planes, and now I know how to fly a plane.
[49:26.52]Glitch in the system, investigate, and this is where we land.
[49:37.35]So I get off here and I take out the mining company.
[49:39.87]Hey.
[49:39.95]E.C.
[49:40.01]thee.
[49:40.67]Or ice thee.
[49:41.17]Thanks for the $15.
[49:42.23]Wow, what's happening?
[49:43.63]Hello?
[49:45.51]What?
[49:45.67]Okay.
[49:45.91]That was weird.
[49:47.41]I say...
[50:00.63]I would give you a sentimental story, but the truth is I just like the badge.
[50:06.25]Well, thank you.
[50:08.53]That's... It is a cool badge.
[50:11.87]Alright, is that all I had to do?
[50:16.58]Destroy the outcast hawks that have come into the area.
[50:18.94]I wish you could have told me that I had a lock on.
[50:25.58]Like an hour ago.
[50:27.87]One hour ago.
[50:28.57]Like an hour ago.
[50:30.07]Hours ago.
[50:31.57]At least an hour ago.
[50:34.63]Where is he?
[50:35.05]Right there?
[50:35.41]Alright, release.
[50:40.36]That's so much more fun!
[50:43.68]You see how much more fun that is to do?
[50:45.62]That's the hold B in Star Fox.
[50:48.20]Nobody ever used the regular shoot in Star Fox.
[50:50.71]Everybody held B.
[51:00.73]It was the cleanest way to get rid of all the enemies.
[51:12.62]He goes 1, 2, 3, 4.
[51:13.26]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[51:14.02]I don't think I have any more bullets left.
[51:18.00]Okay.
[51:22.03]That supply's dropped.
[51:22.93]Is that guy dead?
[51:23.67]Hit the brakes.
[51:29.83]This just turns into, like, so much more interesting of a game.
[51:34.07]First it was Red Faction Guerrilla, but not good.
[51:36.65]And now it's cool Star Fox dogfight game.
[51:48.22]Gun overheated, it's alright.
[51:50.32]Whoa!
[51:50.68]That was close.
[51:54.34]Fuck, I don't wanna next this now.
[51:55.60]We were gonna next this really, really, really, really, really soon.
[52:01.58]We have to at least give it, like, another ten minutes.
[52:03.44]After this, like, dumb tutorial plane mission.
[52:12.09]Eight bullets.
[52:18.41]All direct hits.
[52:20.89]Goddamn, I'm good.
[52:23.89]Sometimes I surprise myself.
[52:30.05]You know, sometimes you look in the mirror and you're shocked.
[52:33.31]You're just like, God damn!
[52:35.17]How did I get this good?
[52:39.84]And the mirror shatters because of your likeness.
[52:42.72]It can't handle it.
[52:44.06]Narcissist.
[52:55.62]Silver complete.
[52:56.42]Say, smooth as silver.
[52:58.62]I didn't claim to be anything else.
[53:05.43]Thank you, Kilgannon, for the $1.
[53:09.23]I'm proud of you.
[53:10.77]Thank you.
[53:11.69]Kilgannon again, thanks for the $1.
[53:13.07]Is this Tom Clancy's hop?
[53:13.81]Yes.
[53:13.91]What happened?
[53:20.42]What are you doing?
[53:20.84]Excuse me.
[53:21.14]Excuse me.
[53:21.34]My PlayStation 3 is dying.
[53:22.08]That was my PlayStation 3 screaming in pain.
[53:36.97]Uh, for real though, thanks for the $1.
[53:41.15]If you like this game's space combat, I recommend you try House of the Dying Sun.
[53:48.12]Uh, never heard of it.
[53:52.00]KG8011, thanks for the $5.
[53:54.34]Hey Gerber, my kitten was in the vet most of last week, but is now home, healthy and happy now.
[53:58.88]Thanks for sharing the love, thanks for sharing the effort when I'm down.
[54:01.94]I'm glad that your kitty is, uh, is doing alright, home and happy.
[54:07.55]Much love to you.
[54:09.63]Thanks for sticking around.
[54:13.70]Starhawks.
[54:14.38]Was this multiplayer?
[54:15.38]This was multiplayer?
[54:16.62]This right here.
[54:17.18]Holy shit, this would have been fun, like, back in the day.
[54:21.74]That was a crash, but the game didn't understand what a crash was, so it didn't do it.
[54:31.47]Can you imagine playing this with, like, ten people fighting?
[54:35.29]Wait, somebody said it wasn't.
[54:39.74]It wasn't fun.
[54:42.23]All the reviews, I've read a bunch of reviewers that said, Wowie!
[54:47.03]This is a great game.
[54:49.21]And you know, for what it is, back when this game came out, this was like a PlayStation 3 exclusive, right?
[54:55.41]I'm going to have to probably agree with them.
[55:00.49]It's okay.
[55:01.12]It's alright.
[55:01.66]Crashes don't matter.
[55:02.38]You can crash a hundred times.
[55:05.18]Your plane is fine.
[55:06.44]The only things that can kill you are bullets.
[55:17.78]Come on, get it up there.
[55:18.46]I don't have any bullets left.
[55:19.30]Shit.
[55:23.48]Alright, I need some supplies.
[55:26.04]Supplies!
[55:26.50]There we go.
[55:27.86]Right here.
[55:28.82]This looks like a supply... green.
[55:32.93]What is this?
[55:33.43]It's a boost.
[55:37.37]I don't think I get any supplies.
[55:38.45]I don't think they like me enough to do anything to me.
[55:39.73]Supplies?
[55:44.65]Supplies?
[55:48.47]You fucking dick.
[55:56.97]No man's sky looks better after the update.
[56:05.47]Alright, we're done.
[56:06.71]We're done after this.
[56:09.41]I see supplies.
[56:10.09]No, that's not.
[56:11.42]Shit, what is this?
[56:12.12]Is this a dead pixel on my screen or is this supplies?
[56:15.30]Where is it?
[56:18.17]You just saw that yellow pixel, right?
[56:19.43]Where is that?
[56:19.93]There it is.
[56:20.69]Supplies.
[56:21.33]Give them to me.
[56:23.43]Boink.
[56:23.61]I have to get through this section.
[56:27.33]Otherwise, I'm not a 1990 to 8 game.
[56:29.17]Get him.
[56:38.48]Get on.
[56:38.92]This guy right here.
[56:42.30]Dead.
[56:42.46]One down.
[56:42.94]Here comes a guy.
[56:43.68]Slow down.
[56:44.22]Break.
[56:45.71]Spin it.
[56:52.94]There were probably some people that were really good at this game.
[56:59.21]I'm not one of them.
[56:59.77]Can I dodge it?
[57:02.99]Come on.
[57:06.57]Oh, please.
[57:09.20]Please.
[57:11.78]You guys aren't ready for the next game.
[57:14.52]I don't think you guys are going to be prepared for the next game.
[57:19.12]In fact, like 500 of you are going to leave.
[57:22.46]I bet you anything.
[57:24.58]I bet you any anything that like 400 people are gonna leave in the next game.
[57:32.90]You wanna see?
[57:34.56]You wanna see?
[57:35.58]I... No, it's not Minecraft.
[57:38.22]Minecraft isn't even for PS3.
[57:43.49]He's gonna pass me.
[57:44.01]Come on, pass me.
[57:45.95]If I'm going too slow... Yeah, I'm gonna explode, so I better not fuck this up.
[57:49.37]I just faked him out.
[57:57.09]Come on, we're both smoking.
[57:57.93]Alright, nice, I did.
[58:01.26]Alright, I win.
[58:03.98]I can build?
[58:06.52]Let's land it.
[58:07.68]Land.
[58:14.23]Now we fight.
[58:14.85]What are you doing?
[58:17.69]No, land.
[58:19.35]Land the car.
[58:22.38]Alright, now get up there.
[58:26.50]R3 is stomping.
[58:27.70]I don't think it's going to last very long.
[58:31.86]Stomp these guys.
[58:38.56]Well, this is where I explode.
[58:44.86]Fun game.
[58:45.88]Fun game.
[58:46.70]If you're a PlayStation 3 fan and you're looking for a new game for Christmas for PlayStation 3, I'm going to have to recommend you get Starhawk.
[58:55.34]If this was holiday season 2006, I would say get Starhawk.
[59:02.79]2006, recommend holiday season.
[59:10.34]Do I have wings?
[59:25.27]And he was never heard from again.
[59:26.93]Alright.
[59:31.68]Well, that's... Oh, God damn it.
[59:33.38]Why?
