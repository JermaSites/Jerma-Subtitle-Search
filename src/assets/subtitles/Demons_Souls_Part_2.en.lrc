[02:22.53]Oh yeah, I forgot about that.
[02:26.33]Real gamers drink milk.
[02:27.51]You know, I've been on like a real almond milk.
[02:31.62]An almond milk kick.
[02:34.47]I always liked it.
[02:35.09]I always enjoyed it.
[02:40.99]Sub only mode?
[02:41.67]We're not going to do sub only mode tonight.
[02:43.84]Not tonight.
[02:46.54]It didn't really... It was okay.
[02:48.42]It didn't really do anything last time.
[02:49.84]I just wanted to see.
[02:52.54]If we need to put it on, we will.
[02:56.14]But no sub only tonight.
[03:02.22]Freedom, freedom, freedom.
[03:08.21]But give me one extra second while I situate my body.
[03:12.19]You know, every time I say that, what if I, like, you know, we're with the starting soon screen, and I say, oh, give me just one more minute.
[03:18.18]I don't leave.
[03:20.44]I mute the mic, and I, like, adjust my seat, crack my neck a couple of times.
[03:25.08]I take a couple of deep breaths, like, just kind of move around a little.
[03:31.09]I look around, I look out the window to make sure, like, what time it is, because I can read the sun.
[03:37.47]then we go so give me a minute okay let's get rid of this switch over to the game

[04:52.37]Alright, hold on, so this is from XX Horse, uh, Person.
[04:58.11]From XX Horse Pusson, uh, Puss Person.

[05:07.33]Horse person, thank you for the $100.
[05:15.36]Thank you for the 100 bucks.
[05:17.26]That says, $100 for feeling 100% love you.
[05:21.41]Well, thank you.
[05:22.59]Thank you, horse person.
[05:26.31]I haven't been feeling well, guys.
[05:27.71]I'm sorry.
[05:28.15]Like, my brain is... My brain slows down when I don't feel well.
[05:31.65]And I don't get, like, a good amount of sleep.
[05:34.14]My brain gets down to, like, 28 percentile.
[05:36.90]And you guys know me at 100 percentile.
[05:40.16]It ain't that great at 100%.
[05:42.90]So right now, I'm like, I'm minus like 82%.
[05:48.88]So, and plus, I've taken, look, I have some, I have a coffee here, which is artificial, it's a buff, right?
[05:54.60]I get like plus 11 from coffee.
[05:58.46]And I get like, I get like plus 10 from a sandwich.
[06:02.83]So right now, I'm fucking at 28 plus 11 plus 10.
[06:06.51]Not that great.
[06:08.87]But thank you, XXHorsePerson, for the $100.
[06:12.27]That's an extremely generous thing to do.
[06:15.88]And hopefully I can make this stream worth your while.
[06:20.82]Even though, who knows?
[06:21.70]We might go to Stone Fang and I might quit the game in 20 minutes.
[06:25.74]But thank you, dude.
[06:27.47]Very, very kind of you.
[06:30.25]49% double-digit IQ.
[06:32.01]I have a triple-digit IQ.
[06:33.71]Read about it.
[06:35.03]Type in Jerma985's IQ into Google.
[06:39.31]Bingo.
[06:40.03]You'll find it.
[06:41.06]It's on every fucking government website.
[06:44.32]Anyway, thank you, Turvor, for the two bucks.
[06:47.34]We got money.
[06:48.76]Man, like... Money.
[06:51.77]Fucking money without even starting.
[06:54.94]StixRenegade, thanks for the $10.
[06:56.74]Is this the streamer who's going to watch Rat Movie on stream?
[07:00.24]PogChamp.
[07:01.22]No, no.
[07:02.14]Alright, I'll watch Rat Movie one day.
[07:04.20]Like, in the next couple weeks.
[07:06.21]It's just going to play in the background randomly.
[07:09.22]But thank you, Styx, for the ten bucks.
[07:10.66]Appreciate it, man.
[07:12.18]Gary Gray, thanks for the bits.
[07:13.32]Hey, take some bits before going sub-only.
[07:16.22]It ain't gonna be so.
[07:16.74]We're not doing sub-only.
[07:17.72]It's been long enough for people to trickle in.
[07:19.56]We're not doing sub-only tonight.
[07:21.02]Unless we have to.
[07:22.58]Don't make me have to.
[07:25.04]Right?
[07:26.80]Everyone would be good.
[07:29.06]But thank you, Gary.
[07:30.96]Also, Tava... Tavas...
[07:34.51]Tevasi, thanks for the $5.
[07:36.05]Do you think a robot arm could outfrag you?
[07:38.97]Even if I'm using the Razer DeathAdder.
[07:40.79]Well, no, the Razer DeathAdder makes my gaming skills... Like, my gaming skills are at like a 48, but the Razer DeathAdder is a buff.
[07:48.54]It's like a plus 40.
[07:50.06]So, just having the Razer DeathAdder alone, you know, even if you're at a 48 gamer skill out of 100, that gets you to 88.
[07:56.00]So, I don't think so.
[08:00.52]But thank you, Tevasi.
[08:03.32]Thank you, Sam.
[08:04.00]Thank you, Little Almond, for the $15 right off the bat here.
[08:08.59]Craygasm, Craygasm, Craygasm.
[08:11.59]Person.
[08:12.17]They spelt out a swear word, but I'm going to say Person.
[08:15.01]Thank you, the $15.
[08:17.29]BadaBing, it's Ben.
[08:17.89]Thanks for the $5.
[08:18.67]And EchoLeekch, thanks for the $1.
[08:20.61]Hope you feel better soon.
[08:21.51]This is BadaBing.
[08:22.91]I'm going to be trying my first Dark Souls game while I watch you.
[08:25.49]The first one.
[08:26.43]So wish me luck.
[08:27.01]It's very good.
[08:29.29]I complain a lot about Demon's Souls and Dark Souls and shit, but they are fantastic fucking video games.
[08:34.99]Like, I need to preface this every time.
[08:36.45]Every time I talk shit about Demon's Souls or Dark Souls or Bloodborne, I'm speaking out of, like, disappointment as a parent, right?
[08:43.37]Like, you love your child.
[08:45.75]But sometimes, sometimes they smoke weed.
[08:48.45]And you don't know about it, and you hear about it.
[08:49.83]Like, you're like 15-year-old son, like, smoked a joint.
[08:52.81]What are you gonna do?
[08:53.93]You sit him down.
[08:55.85]He walks in the house, and I can smell it.
[08:58.05]I know where he's been.
[08:58.89]He's been out with his fucking... He's been out with that bad crowd.
[09:01.34]You sit him down.
[09:02.94]You say, son, I picked up a scent about something when you came in the door.
[09:09.24]Um...
[09:11.09]Can we talk about this?
[09:12.09]And he's gonna be like, SHUT UP DAD!
[09:13.65]And I'm gonna be like, son, I didn't raise you like that.
[09:17.57]You sit down and we have a conversation about this.
[09:19.17]And then I'm gonna tell him about the first time that I smoked weed.
[09:22.90]Which was never!
[09:23.76]I never did!
[09:25.08]And how dare you bring that into my house!
[09:27.10]You're my son!
[09:28.28]Don't you fucking ever smoke that devil lettuce in my fucking apartment ever again!
[09:34.26]And we live in an apartment, it's a tiny apartment.
[09:37.85]It's a fucking, it's a one, it's a studio.
[09:42.09]What is this?
[09:44.57]Why is there another one down here?
[09:49.38]Alright, let me like remember what I was doing.
[09:50.76]I think I have to go this way.
[09:51.70]There's the merchant over there.
[09:54.76]Let me like, let me pay attention.
[09:56.48]Last time I had a headache.
[09:57.34]Still have a headache.
[09:57.94]I've had a headache for like fucking seven days.
[10:01.79]I learned by watching you.
[10:07.51]Oh, God.
[10:10.08]He just, like, saw me, like, smoking in my, like, fucking study.
[10:15.32]And by the way, I told you it was a one fucking bedroom.
[10:17.28]Yeah, it's a study.
[10:18.70]The whole thing is dad's study.
[10:22.18]The entire apartment is my study.
[10:25.14]Again, I got books everywhere and shit.
[10:26.62]I'm gonna go this way first.
[10:29.04]I'm gonna be careful here.
[10:29.78]I got a better weapon now.
[10:30.80]This is a plus one battle axe.
[10:34.08]Let's take it slow, like the way you're supposed to play these games.
[10:39.66]I'm gonna kill all of them.
[10:47.82]I don't like how these guys take so much damage, though.
[10:49.52]It's not fair.
[10:50.18]Why can't I have a health pool like that?
[10:54.64]Yeah, you know the typical dad study?
[10:59.47]That's what I'm gonna have when I'm older.
[11:01.67]I'm gonna sleep in there.
[11:02.31]My bed's gonna be in there.
[11:04.37]My computer's gonna be in there.
[11:06.75]My kitchen's gonna be in there.
[11:08.49]There's gonna be a crowded fucking room.
[11:11.26]You're not gonna be able to do anything in that room.
[11:14.78]Dad's study is the fucking house.
[11:18.82]People are gonna come over and be uncomfortable being there.
[11:28.66]Nice baseball swing.
[11:30.26]Speaking of baseball.
[11:34.68]Room stream?
[11:36.56]Don't I have... Where am I, uh... Speaking of fucking... Speaking of, like, weed.
[11:45.92]I'm trying to, like, smoke some weed right now.
[11:50.00]No, I'm not doing a weed thing.
[11:52.12]That's too easy.
[11:53.62]You guys know I don't like to do that easy shit.
[11:55.34]You know, that's easy.
[11:56.18]Like being like, oh, fucking smoking weed.
[12:02.39]Okay, well, where... Where the fuck did they even... Aren't they supposed to break through a door when you walk into it?
[12:09.77]Why would they just all three of them in my face in a quarter of a second?
[12:15.93]What the fuck was that?
[12:20.00]Okay.
[12:22.66]They broke out of a door last time.
[12:27.57]That's what I get for smoking weed.
[12:33.85]What the fuck?
[12:34.57]Like, I was playing that, like, well.
[12:37.39]And all of a sudden, three dogs with a tenth of a second attack frame killed me in less than a second.
[12:44.44]That was fun.
[12:46.06]Why even... I shouldn't even be attacking these guys.
[12:48.46]They're fucking useless.
[12:50.61]Just kill the dogs.
[12:52.81]Look, look, they didn't break out that quickly last time.
[12:55.11]What?
[12:59.80]That door broke last stream.
[13:02.58]When I walked up to it.
[13:04.28]Not the other way around.
[13:08.70]No, what are you... Okay.
[13:17.98]We take one hit.
[13:21.97]Well, at least they got him.
[13:22.69]Those things suck ass.
[13:23.98]Holy shit.
[13:24.42]Those are the worst.
[13:24.90]Those are the worst dogs of any Dark Souls game.
[13:36.76]I'm gonna raise my hand into the class, and you're gonna call on me.
[13:39.60]I'm gonna say, Teacher, these are the worst Dark Souls dogs.
[13:42.60]And the teacher's gonna go, Correct.
[13:43.98]And I'm gonna get a couple of brownie points with the teacher.
[13:47.91]Okay, let me be careful.
[13:48.67]Don't bother with nothing.
[13:49.69]What?
[13:52.70]I am going to clear this room because I'm terrified of what could possibly be in here.
[13:55.66]And why am I not going for a backstab?
[13:59.52]That was so easy.
[14:00.70]Why can I not... Give me the backstab!
[14:07.93]That's three swings with the R2.
[14:14.85]Then she asked me to do long division.
[14:16.37]Nah, I wouldn't be able to do that.
[14:19.92]I can just answer very specific questions about a video game that I'm currently playing.
[14:26.54]You know, it's like, that's all I can do, guys.
[14:31.37]So the teacher's gonna ask, like, when the Declaration of Independence was signed.
[14:36.33]And I'm gonna raise my hand.
[14:40.37]Yeah, class, when was the, uh... When was the Declaration of Independence signed?
[14:46.38]Jeremy, yes, in the back there.
[14:49.49]Uh, the song of storms in Zelda is, uh, see left, see right, see right, see down, see up, see right, see down.
[14:59.42]Okay, uh, you're coming after class for detention.
[15:03.28]Aw, what?
[15:07.08]Do I have any half moon?
[15:09.14]Do I have any, like, half good weed?
[15:10.46]I thought I was gonna be off that.
[15:14.51]No.
[15:15.49]Fuck.
[15:17.26]Well, we're gonna have to do, like, Full Moon after I get hit, like, three more times.
[15:27.20]I don't like these guys.
[15:27.92]They're too slow.
[15:30.88]They should be much quicker than that.
[15:34.12]Shard of Hard Stone.
[15:35.44]That guy dropped a lot of stuff.
[15:36.44]I think I gotta do a weapon, too.
[15:41.29]Full Moon Weed.
[15:43.91]Uh, what's that weapon I just picked up?
[15:49.22]Iron Knuckles.
[15:52.58]D. D. I picked up a couple of things here.
[15:57.24]Bastard Sword is D. No, this is not good enough.
[15:59.44]95 plus 13.
[16:02.16]80.
[16:03.18]Minus 49.
[16:03.50]No.
[16:06.58]What is this?
[16:08.08]What's with all these dex weapons?
[16:11.44]I've picked up one decent strength weapon this whole time.
[16:15.02]And it's barely better than the fucking club.
[16:20.68]That's not fair.
[16:21.34]And it's plus one.
[16:23.86]A crushing battle axe plus one is only... is barely even like ten points better than this stupid fucking club.
[16:35.00]Is this another one of those Dark Souls games that has a... Of course it is.
[16:39.16]Like a bunch of good dex weapons and then it takes like halfway through the whole game to get a good strength weapon.
[16:45.85]I gotta look at this.
[16:46.43]What's the difference between these?
[16:50.33]Recover most of the HP and recover a large amount of HP.
[16:55.41]What?
[16:57.51]Recover a large amount of HP.
[16:59.15]Recover most of your HP.
[17:03.27]What's the difference?
[17:07.04]That's not like a denomination.
[17:10.32]That's the same denomination.
[17:20.41]The club has been an unbeatable starter weapon in any Souls game.
[17:22.99]It gets outclassed later on when you're fully upgraded and get strengthened decks.
[17:26.61]Yeah, that just is.
[17:27.43]You're right.
[17:31.01]Most equals large.
[17:32.06]Large could be most.
[17:36.74]Speaking of... I have to do this.
[17:38.48]I'm afraid I'm going to die in one hit from this fucking asshole.
[17:40.98]Because this guy sucks.
[17:42.64]He's a pyromancer.
[17:44.60]What else is in this room?
[17:45.60]I knew it.
[17:52.53]Just be careful.
[17:53.31]Can I lure him out?
[17:56.05]Is this idiot here?
[17:56.91]That guy's smoking a cigar.
[18:04.18]I'm gonna get screwed.
[18:05.00]I know it, but whatever.
[18:05.90]One more hit.
[18:12.86]Okay, he's dead.
[18:18.75]Full moon grass.
[18:21.64]chunks shard of clear stone and Cool, okay I'm gonna go through this side.
[18:34.11]Wait, he's got a key Huh He's laughing at my weed jokes.
[18:41.26]No, I'm not even laughing at my weed jokes don't laugh at those don't encourage me to use like low quality humor Kill him
[18:53.43]I'm not... Look, do you guys want me to fall?
[18:55.63]You want me to fall?
[18:56.51]You guys really want this channel to fall from grace?
[18:59.98]I can do it.
[19:02.14]I'm just gonna... I'm gonna say Doritos the next time I'm able to.
[19:06.40]You know?
[19:08.84]Like, the next chance I'm able to, I'm gonna make, like, a Mountain Dew Doritos joke.
[19:13.93]You want me to do that?
[19:14.65]Because I can do that.
[19:16.47]And then the channel will be at the bottom.
[19:18.31]It'll be at rock bottom at that point.
[19:25.63]This guy actually is not a moron, so we have to deal with him accordingly.
[19:38.90]Doritos.
[19:41.02]But that's the joke you make when you don't have a joke.
[19:44.96]I should put that on top of my Doritos MLG montage.
[19:49.71]Right?
[19:49.87]That's like what you say.
[19:50.59]Everybody says that.
[19:53.31]I know a lot of YouTubers and a lot of streamers.
[19:55.67]They've all said that unironically, like as a joke, to make a joke.
[19:59.53]I'm certain of it.
[20:00.19]I promise you'll never get a Doritos joke out of me.
[20:09.84]Unless it's been clearly thought out.
[20:13.16]Like for instance.
[20:15.42]Take a look at these cool ranch Doritos.
[20:18.55]This is the fucking facility where they dust them.
[20:21.02]That's like the Dorito dust, and that's the Cool Ranch Doritos.
[20:24.02]You'll get something like that from me.
[20:32.24]I told you so.
[20:32.92]Oh, moon grass.
[20:39.51]Come on, that's the type of quality humor that you paid for, you know?
[20:45.81]Let me check in here first.
[20:50.12]So scared.
[20:52.74]Pickaxe.
[20:55.84]Pickaxe kind of sounds like a strength weapon.
[21:04.71]No, it's not.
[21:05.21]Of course it's not.
[21:07.27]What the fuck?
[21:09.13]Why does everything have to be like a decent dexterity weapon?
[21:15.17]I already picked up like the Uchi Kitana.
[21:18.43]I have these cool weapons that I can't use.
[21:20.91]Look at these three.
[21:21.45]I got a scimitar, a killige, and an uchi katana.
[21:27.68]You want a fucking cereal box axe?
[21:30.02]That's what you get for a strength weapon so far.
[21:38.67]Since when is a pickaxe a dex weapon?
[21:40.93]Well, since this is the first game ever.
[21:42.73]I guess since now.
[21:45.71]I gotta be careful because I'm probably...
[21:48.35]Okay.
[21:48.57]And this is exactly what the fuck I was talking about.
[21:52.55]I'm not gonna fucking fuck around.
[21:54.81]Not a chance.
[21:55.35]I gotta redo this.
[22:01.06]This is like all fucked up right now.
[22:04.46]This is like a paint set.
[22:05.72]Alright, we got new moon, full moon, late moon.
[22:12.79]Jesus Christ, man.
[22:13.75]There's too many paints!
[22:16.27]What am I, painting a fucking tree?
[22:17.79]Like, this is what I would use.
[22:18.54]These are the colors I would use.
[22:23.30]Okay, we're gonna do this now.
[22:24.36]I don't... I don't like this.
[22:30.74]There's a guy up there that throws shit, and it's so dark.
[22:33.50]Okay, let's just go this way.
[22:35.82]Alright, I gotta kind of be logical here.
[22:39.64]Be careful.
[22:40.14]And there he is.
[22:43.70]Just get up to the top.
[22:46.63]Item.
[22:49.21]Unknown soul.
[22:50.05]That's good.
[22:52.67]Anything else?
[22:54.43]Oh, I can go down here.
[22:56.69]Don't.
[22:57.35]Please no jumpy thing that's going to jump on me.
[23:02.29]Okay, those are not homing.
[23:06.40]Shit, I can't get over there.
[23:08.06]Good thing, because I was about to roll.
[23:11.22]I was about to roll into the fucking dirt.
[23:13.58]That would have been so terrible.
[23:14.64]Thank god I didn't do that.
[23:21.10]I'm losing.
[23:22.74]Look at this wall.
[23:23.34]Can you tell me that's not an illusory wall?
[23:25.82]Look at how much damage that does.
[23:30.09]Damn it.
[23:33.93]What happens here?
[23:36.91]Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[23:40.03]Of course.
[23:41.98]Of course that happens.
[23:43.42]And I should have been paying more attention.
[23:45.30]I saw the bloodstains.
[23:46.42]I saw the shit there.
[23:47.22]And I think that's supposed to happen.
[23:48.38]That's okay.
[23:48.86]Just be easy.
[23:51.40]I hear all kinds of noise.
[23:56.82]Shit.
[23:57.22]Okay.
[23:57.94]Gotta play this correctly.
[23:59.00]Don't fuck around here.
[24:03.22]I've never done this before.
[24:04.88]I don't know this area.
[24:05.78]I don't know the enemies.
[24:06.58]I don't know... Wait.
[24:09.15]I already did this.
[24:12.70]Oh, this is just like where I was before.
[24:15.44]Okay.
[24:17.30]Looks like we're going back up.
[24:25.47]Look, I'm so paranoid.
[24:28.61]All these games are just paranoid the video game.
[24:31.93]They just scare you.
[24:35.11]I should just drop down then.
[24:38.49]He's going to drop down here.
[24:39.33]That guy's still going to be shooting at me though, isn't he?
[24:48.54]I don't want to get... I will get one hit by that fucking thing.
[24:52.52]If he still shoots at me.
[24:53.36]If he has line of sight.
[24:54.16]That's what I'm concerned about.
[24:57.00]You're an idiot.
[24:57.44]You're just letting me do this.
[25:00.14]Paranoia is a symptom of being high on THC.
[25:03.81]Come on.
[25:04.55]No.
[25:04.79]No.
[25:06.61]Even if you're right, it doesn't matter.
[25:07.98]This is a Demon's Souls game.
[25:09.50]This is Dark Souls.
[25:10.32]This is the first ever Dark Souls.
[25:12.00]This is before they learned all the things about how not to be soapy.
[25:15.32]Oh, fuck.
[25:18.16]He can have line of sight.
[25:24.70]This is the concentrate.
[25:27.22]This is before they diluted their soap.
[25:32.16]See, I knew it.
[25:33.03]God damn it.
[25:36.10]This is... I gotta calm down.
[25:38.36]Calm down.
[25:39.08]You're fine.
[25:40.50]I just gotta get around and press that button.
[25:43.50]We're gonna... I think I'm just gonna run for it.
[25:44.94]No, we gotta clear this guy first.
[25:48.25]Just watch it.
[25:49.75]See?
[25:50.09]There it is.
[25:50.59]Okay.
[25:52.45]Watch it!
[25:52.83]Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it.
[25:53.91]I'm gonna fucking die here.
[25:54.65]I gotta be... I have to pay a thousand percent attention.
[25:58.25]Oh my fucking god.
[25:59.10]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[26:01.02]Please, please, please.
[26:01.92]Wooo!
[26:06.63]Okay.
[26:08.15]That could have been fucking so bad.
[26:10.07]I can walk over the broken bridge?
[26:15.31]What?
[26:17.04]I cannot walk over the broken bridge.
[26:18.50]Hold on a second.
[26:23.54]I'm getting, like, texted now.
[26:26.46]Alright.
[26:28.38]Okay, I'm safe.
[26:32.87]He's too far away.
[26:33.53]Alright, let's go.
[26:36.07]Are these dogs?
[26:37.01]No, they're not.
[26:44.54]I'm paying so much attention to that fat fucking asshole up there.
[26:47.72]There's treasure ahead, aren't there?
[26:50.76]Lies about texting.
[26:51.54]No, I got texted.
[26:52.12]My sister just texted me.
[26:53.28]Her birthday is tomorrow.
[26:57.29]When she's like, we're trying to plan what we're going to do tomorrow.
[27:02.04]What if I just, like, fucking screamed at her on the tech?
[27:04.00]I was like, I'm in the middle of damage stalls.
[27:05.76]Like, leave me alone.
[27:06.90]Alright, where is... Does that have splash damage?
[27:19.19]I gotta get underneath so he can't do that.
[27:21.69]Just pull this so I'm not in trouble.
[27:23.99]And whatever this does... I'm sure we'll find out.
[27:29.03]Alright, let me have a fucking... Let me just, like...
[27:31.85]Let me just like real quickly just eat a fucking radish.
[27:45.22]I didn't even see the cutscene.
[27:46.38]What was it?
[27:49.04]What was it?
[27:52.64]I missed it.
[27:53.02]What was it?
[27:55.28]What's happening right now?
[27:56.28]What was it moving?
[27:57.04]What did it move?
[28:02.58]I don't know what it moved.
[28:06.28]The gate above me.
[28:06.94]Okay, good to know.
[28:13.41]It's pretty spicy.
[28:18.23]Radish edibles.
[28:23.17]No.
[28:23.86]No, that's not what these are.
[28:31.50]I'm going to have to run.
[28:37.61]Is this going to pop open again?
[28:38.53]Is that what you're telling me?
[28:46.03]Did I take too long?
[28:49.80]Don't tell me I took too long.
[28:56.20]No, I can still hear it.
[28:56.94]Do I have to go all the way around?
[29:08.11]I hope that's not the case.
[29:09.41]Because I've been taking my sweet-ass time.
[29:16.13]Give me, give me.
[29:18.21]Iron Knuckles again.
[29:18.99]I can't just go backwards, huh?
[29:26.72]Can you hear it closing?
[29:29.52]No, that's just the... This thing's just spinning around.
[29:34.82]This is just back down to where I was, right?
[29:36.30]Okay.
[29:41.82]These guys remind me of the Bloodborne bag enemies.
[29:43.46]It's almost like they're the same developer.
[29:45.80]Alright, we're not allowed to eat another radish.
[29:50.58]Until I do a cool move.
[29:55.55]After this one.
[29:56.01]I don't know why I'm eating radishes.
[30:09.11]They're fucking good, actually.
[30:10.55]If you've never had a radish...
[30:13.76]They're actually pretty fantastic.
[30:16.57]They can be a little spicy though.
[30:18.31]If you don't like onions, you won't like radishes.
[30:21.49]They can hurt.
[30:22.45]They can be burning.
[30:23.11]They can fulfill you.
[30:25.71]Fulfill you?
[30:27.54]What is this?
[30:27.92]Is this a boss?
[30:33.28]This ain't a boss, is it?
[30:42.63]Meat and raw radishes?
[30:43.47]Yeah, fuck yeah.
[30:46.05]What is that?
[30:46.61]What is that?
[30:47.01]Is it a lizard?
[30:49.17]Okay.
[30:51.04]There's salamanders now.
[30:56.56]Woo!
[30:58.00]Woo!
[31:01.52]These are... These are fresh.
[31:04.83]Woo!
[31:09.67]Be careful, though.
[31:10.63]Your stomach might not be able to handle a raw radish.
[31:12.41]You can't handle it.
[31:16.49]Pretty good.
[31:18.69]This is where they make the fucking Soylent Green.
[31:21.64]It's made out of people.
[31:25.50]You know, actually, I tried Soylent.
[31:26.84]I actually did eat Soylent.
[31:29.83]I got, like, a month's supply of the Soylent chocolate bottles.
[31:35.54]And, I mean, you want to have a real product review here?
[31:39.38]I'll give you a real product review.
[31:45.50]You guys know what Ensure is?
[31:48.69]You know like your grandmother?
[31:53.01]Ensure is a thing that old people drink.
[31:56.79]And what they did is they dumped it in another bottle and called it a cool name.
[32:04.55]And that's it.
[32:08.58]Is it good?
[32:09.04]I mean, it's alright.
[32:10.14]It's good.
[32:10.92]I like it.
[32:12.26]But, I mean, it's just Ensure with a fancy, cool, trendy name.
[32:20.05]That's a pretty sick Mario sound.
[32:24.87]Wow!
[32:53.14]I can get up there.
[32:57.64]The gate's open.
[32:58.22]We'll run through it.
[33:00.82]We're gonna... This is a spicy radish.
[33:03.61]Holy shit.
[33:06.99]This is a spicy radish.
[33:11.03]Those dogs come back, right?
[33:13.83]Should I run by the dogs?
[33:15.39]No, I gotta fight the dog.
[33:17.90]Oh!
[33:20.72]Whew.
[33:22.34]Why are you spinning a rat- Why are you doing that?
[33:27.85]Oh my fucking god.
[33:30.21]Why?
[33:31.41]Why do they- Why?
[33:32.31]Why the fuck would you spin a hundred and- Oh, this is a spicy radish!
[33:40.67]Out of the way?
[33:45.90]Wait!
[33:56.83]Okay, we're fine Let's go I'm telling you, the radishes are giving me fucking strength right now
[34:19.40]I'm getting at least, like, 30% more strength from eating these radishes.
[34:22.81]That's why this is, like, deep down, this is just to eat your fucking vegetable screen, you know what I mean?
[34:30.07]Am I burning?
[34:32.23]Wait, what was that, like, fucking claymation move he just did?
[34:34.87]He just, like, extended.
[34:35.71]He did, like, the Battlefield 1 long neck thing.
[34:39.73]I'm not fighting these guys.
[34:40.64]No way.
[34:40.92]I need to go get my shit.
[34:47.70]Do you think they'd be a hunt?
[34:54.00]I've been in soul form for so long.
[34:57.18]I feel ya.
[34:58.00]Oh, I feel ya there, friend.
[35:01.29]Alright, we're going into the hot sauna, and we're gonna walk out with our stuff.
[35:07.73]And we're not gonna do that again.
[35:10.39]Anything?
[35:10.69]Okay, there's a body there.
[35:14.23]Got my shit.
[35:15.89]Hold on.
[35:17.01]This is dangerous, but that could be something worth having.
[35:20.85]Oh, no.
[35:21.59]No, it's not.
[35:22.29]Don't do it.
[35:23.31]Somebody look up on the Wikipedia what that is.
[35:28.60]I'm not going to risk my life for that if I don't know what it is.
[35:37.52]I hate leaving things untouched in these games, though.
[36:05.25]What the fuck was it?
[36:06.01]I don't even know.
[36:13.14]I'm like... I can't hit those things with this weapon.
[36:22.40]Now I gotta run through that shit again.
[36:28.89]It was a fucking... Wait, what was it?
[36:30.29]What the fuck was it?
[36:30.99]Like, hold on.
[36:33.67]What was it?
[36:34.91]I can't remember what it looked like.
[36:40.63]Was it like a shard or something?
[36:46.98]What the fuck is this?
[36:52.26]What is a soul tendency?
[36:54.24]A world tendency?
[36:57.38]What does that mean?
[37:00.90]Fire upgrade.
[37:03.10]So it actually probably was worth getting.
[37:04.70]What is it called?
[37:10.99]Soul?
[37:11.43]Tendency?
[37:14.25]I don't understand that.
[37:15.33]Okay.
[37:20.80]It's one of the more frustrating aspects of the game.
[37:26.30]Okay, well, I mean...
[37:32.40]This is dangerous.
[37:36.14]I told you this was dangerous.
[37:37.88]Holy fuck, just... No dog, dogs are gonna be behind me now.
[37:44.74]I gotta like fucking stop being such a moron.
[37:50.54]God fucking damn it, man.
[37:52.22]What the fuck?
[37:57.52]I tried, I did it the first time and it didn't fucking work again.
[37:59.54]And I lost a thousand souls, great, cool.
[38:03.30]Wonderful.
[38:04.30]What a wonderful area.
[38:08.07]Tiny hallway, the fucking game.
[38:09.67]Okay, for a second I forgot that the rocks dropped here and I thought that was a guy that just fell down.
[38:23.03]No, no radishes right now.
[38:24.26]That's fucking distracting.
[38:27.02]Of course they put those stupid dogs in this area.
[38:29.54]And the dogs...
[38:31.68]The dogs literally jump and kill you in, like, a bite and a half.
[38:35.51]And they go, like, just like, they're like the fucking werewolves in Bloodborne.
[38:39.83]Like, come on, come over here.
[38:42.93]See?
[38:43.35]He killed me in one hit.
[38:44.03]I'm lucky I didn't die in one hit there.
[38:50.53]Damn it, I'm gonna die again.
[38:59.64]What the fuck?
[39:00.68]Why?
[39:01.38]What?
[39:06.04]Why?
[39:07.55]Why did I instantly die?
[39:09.85]What the fuck happened?
[39:16.51]Oh my god.
[39:17.81]This weapon sucks, by the way.
[39:23.04]Strength is fucking terrible.
[39:25.14]Why did I pick it?
[39:29.12]Strength is fucking trash.
[39:30.56]It always is.
[39:31.48]Why would I do it?
[39:33.72]Is this even slower?
[39:35.94]Don't I know the rules?
[39:38.00]Every Dark Souls game is about how fast you can swing your weapon before dying.
[39:47.97]Why would I ever do a strength build?
[39:50.93]They're fucking dog shit in these games.
[39:56.74]Strength builds are awful until like the last fucking 30 minutes of every Dark Souls game.
[40:01.09]Why the fuck would I do it?
[40:01.95]I'm going up here.
[40:20.11]He figured it out.
[40:22.39]What do you mean?
[40:23.09]What did I figure out?
[40:24.89]God, I forgot.
[40:29.40]I'm gonna fucking calm down, heal, and kill this guy.
[40:31.49]And these guys can't be hurt by blunt objects.
[40:34.49]I'm just having a passive fucking anger moment right now.
[40:37.93]Put the fucking axe back on.
[40:49.80]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[40:50.74]Go ahead, do it.
[40:57.53]I'm gonna die.
[41:02.64]God, I just like fucking rolled into it.
[41:04.46]I'm so angry right now.
[41:06.40]This is what happens.
[41:07.10]You turn into fucking Adam Sandler when you play these games.
[41:21.55]The other issue I have with this area.
[41:23.56]Why does everybody take like a full stamina bar to kill?
[41:28.64]Why is that?
[41:31.72]I gotta take a full fucking stamina bar to kill one enemy in this zone?
[41:36.58]Who made this game?
[41:46.19]Is that it?
[41:47.79]Did you just get rid of the guys that throw rocks?
[41:51.59]This guy's gone forever now.
[41:55.93]I missed an item down there.
[42:00.92]Go back to the Shrine of Storms if you hate this place so much.
[42:03.30]I know, right?
[42:10.02]Something over there.
[42:10.61]Is there anything at the top?
[42:19.53]What is that?
[42:21.87]Can I get that?
[42:24.38]I'm gonna fall down and die if I try to get this.
[42:29.35]This area is easier with a piercing weapon.
[42:34.19]Well, I mean... Am I really going to bring a spear in here?
[42:37.95]I can't even scale off the spears.
[42:42.79]What is this?
[42:44.31]Stone of the Ephemeralizer.
[42:46.98]Beware of fall ahead.
[42:50.88]Well, I mean, obviously.
[42:54.76]Just use the pickaxe.
[42:57.40]No, don't...
[43:00.73]Piercing weapons destroy these enemies.
[43:05.07]Should I just go get a spear?
[43:09.99]You don't have enough skill to use this weapon.
[43:13.41]I can't even equip some of these things.
[43:21.98]I gotta take this off.
[43:31.58]What about, like, a bastard sword?
[43:34.82]No skill streamer?
[43:36.10]What?
[43:38.64]It's really... Look, it's really easy to say that I have no skill when I'm playing Demon's Souls blind.
[43:44.17]Come on.
[43:45.67]Give me a fucking... Give me a break.
[43:51.77]Let's use the knuckles.
[43:55.66]One second.
[44:00.97]What do the Knuckles do?
[44:02.33]Let me look at these.
[44:08.29]Knuckles, is this just an iron?
[44:13.72]You fucking just walk around with an iron?
[44:16.24]I kind of like this.
[44:22.28]What the hell just happened?
[44:23.22]Oh, look at this iron.
[44:27.83]That's not gonna work.
[44:34.25]Fuckin' iron, no.
[44:35.77]And I'm not gonna dual-weld irons.
[44:37.95]Sorry.
[44:46.20]I'm gonna go buy a spear.
[44:55.08]Uh, I get it.
[44:55.60]I'm going.
[44:56.14]I'm gonna go buy.
[44:56.66]I'm gonna get it.
[44:57.06]I'm gonna go see what you guys are saying.
[44:59.66]I'll go this way first.
[45:03.45]Kill boss with the fucking clothing iron.
[45:09.03]Mail breaker?
[45:09.71]Do I still... I think I stored the mail breaker.
[45:12.81]Yeah, let me go back to town for a second.
[45:14.22]Because this is like... This is fucking awful.
[45:21.44]Hitting somebody with a fucking... A weapon that you need to hit them five times and drain your stamina bar to kill them sucks.
[45:35.46]Try a different area.
[45:36.98]No, I mean, I've got this place.
[45:38.10]I got the door open here.
[45:39.22]Like, I might as well just keep going.
[45:43.43]Anyways, while I got a second.
[45:44.25]Thank you, Turvor, for the bits.
[45:45.45]Jerma, don't get distracted.
[45:47.27]That's just, that's what I do.
[45:49.97]It's not too late for Dex.
[45:53.35]You know you're right.
[45:55.80]Well, thank you so much.
[45:57.54]Appreciate it.
[45:57.98]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[45:59.60]That is very, very kind of you.
[46:00.56]Let's come over here.
[46:01.11]What do you got?
[46:24.49]Does he have the spear?
[46:26.95]My bad luck sucks.
[46:27.95]Who has the spear?
[46:30.21]What about the mail breaker?
[46:33.03]Do I have enough to level up?
[46:36.68]No, no magic.
[46:41.30]I'm not doing magic on my first playthrough.
[46:46.20]There's the mail breaker.
[46:46.92]Let's see that.
[46:50.13]Shields.
[46:54.67]Let's try the Mail Breaker.
[46:56.55]Can I equip it?
[47:01.48]There it is.
[47:02.60]Mail Breaker!
[47:08.18]Like, honestly, this is like... This is pretty good.
[47:11.66]I think I'm okay with this.
[47:12.38]I'm gonna deposit some of the things that I have.
[47:20.40]So we're not going to be using any of these fucking things right now.
[47:23.08]Let's just put them away.
[47:23.68]I'm going to keep the axe just in case.
[47:27.49]This talisman is just weighing me down.
[47:33.57]I'm going to keep the battle axe just in case I need it.
[47:39.73]Put it on the other hand.
[47:40.43]Oh, old ragged robes.
[47:44.18]Can't do anything about you.
[47:48.50]Okay.
[47:49.82]Upgrade the pickaxe?
[47:50.97]No.
[47:51.09]Not gonna upgrade the pickaxe.
[47:56.93]I can just go yoink, yoink.
[47:58.55]Okay.
[48:00.07]Let's give it a try now.
[48:00.94]Okay, upgrade the mail breaker.
[48:06.08]I'm gonna do that.
[48:09.24]Is this gonna be a mail breaker stream?
[48:11.56]E and D.
[48:14.90]Mail Breaker plus one.
[48:15.98]Should I do it?
[48:16.44]Should I go Mail Breaker plus one?
[48:18.34]Should I just upgrade the fuck out of it?
[48:22.48]Why should we hate this?
[48:31.15]Oh god, no.
[48:33.99]No, no, no.
[48:35.40]Why not?
[48:35.82]Yes.
[48:36.12]Don't you dare.
[48:36.94]I'm shaking.
[48:41.99]I'm shaking.
[48:43.86]That's so funny.
[48:45.84]Don't do it.
[48:46.28]I'm shaking.
[48:47.58]I'll upgrade the axe.
[48:48.26]I'll get it to +2.
[48:53.28]Why can I not upgrade the axe?
[48:58.19]Can I not upgrade this axe?
[49:04.23]No, we're going to go back.
[49:06.43]I wish I could buy shit.
[49:11.18]Whatever.
[49:11.98]I cleaned up my inventory.
[49:13.12]I got $626,000.
[49:13.52]I can buy some grass.
[49:14.98]Just buy grass.
[49:20.98]I can spend the money.
[49:26.87]I can only upgrade them in the special forge.
[49:28.65]Okay.
[49:31.17]Well, I'm going to run out of healing items.
[49:33.39]So, let's go.
[49:40.39]Oh, I think 626 is a lot.
[49:42.09]No.
[49:46.57]It's not.
[49:50.78]Like, 200,000 is a lot.
[49:55.32]And you got... This person has a spear, but we're gonna go try Mail Breaker.
[49:59.28]We're gonna give it a go.
[50:01.14]And, like, these guys are back.
[50:02.26]Throwing fucking rocks again.
[50:10.07]Let's see how much easier this becomes.
[50:11.55]But there is an item that I didn't get over here.
[50:17.44]Sticky white stuff.
[50:19.16]You guys can throw those all the way over here?
[50:22.98]What's with that range?
[50:24.02]Range of motion.
[50:24.84]Bullshit.
[50:25.40]Alright, let's see.
[50:28.10]Was this worth doing?
[50:32.37]I need a test subject.
[50:33.27]Okay.
[50:38.07]I mean, it's a little quicker, but it doesn't do that much more damage.
[50:47.24]It is the Mail Breaker, though, so... Don't you have to do a fucking visceral attack?
[50:53.10]Don't you have to parry for the Mail Breaker to be effective?
[51:06.67]If you upgraded the Mail Breaker, you'd be better.
[51:09.07]Well, I mean, you were here, though, when I said I was going to upgrade the Mail Breaker, and everybody in the chat, like, wanted to strangle me.
[51:22.84]Holy shit, this is so bad against these dogs.
[51:31.32]So it's a letter opener.
[51:32.22]Yeah, I know.
[51:34.64]It really is just a letter opener.
[51:35.90]I gotta switch to this.
[51:37.15]These dogs are gonna be a pain in the ass without this.
[51:39.63]Oh my fucking god.
[51:46.07]Like, honest to god, fuck these dogs.
[51:54.16]Where are you going?
[51:58.13]He still hit me, and I dodged it.
[51:59.49]Fuck those dogs!
[52:00.07]They're the worst fucking dogs ever!
[52:01.55]Holy shit!
[52:03.78]My god, why?
[52:04.98]I have no more moon grass.
[52:10.12]This is turning out to be quite a fucking disaster.
[52:14.73]Should've gotten the dog breaker.
[52:17.25]You know, it would be great.
[52:18.81]And, you know, they never learned from this either.
[52:21.15]Like, I don't know why they didn't learn from this.
[52:23.64]Why would you cover my entire screen when I pick up my stuff?
[52:26.14]Like, put it in the bottom right fucking corner.
[52:28.38]Like, what the fuck?
[52:32.77]Why am I even going in here?
[52:39.85]I have no more grass either.
[52:44.43]What about you?
[52:44.81]Do you like to take damage from this?
[52:47.95]Not really.
[52:56.20]I just want to drop something.
[53:00.42]It's first in the series.
[53:01.34]How would they learn?
[53:02.02]No, I'm saying by the time Dark Souls 3 came out, they still did it.
[53:08.32]They've been making these games for a decade and they still cover your whole screen with the, you picked up your stuff.
[53:20.69]I ain't going back to the fucking stupid Salamander bullshit place.
[53:31.33]This is all HP.
[53:32.41]Where's the other one that I had?
[53:33.33]I have a lot of these that I need to use.
[53:39.13]That's all I got, huh?
[53:42.05]Shit.
[53:55.39]Come on, down the stairs with you.
[53:58.33]Lord.
[54:00.63]How come you can do that?
[54:05.73]I can't... You took away my lunging attack in this game FromSoftware.
[54:09.09]But other people can do it.
[54:13.21]My fucking god.
[54:16.79]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[54:26.85]This game is fucking impossible.
[54:32.32]Now I know why people said don't play Demon's Souls.
[54:36.58]Because it's the first ever game they made and all the worst possible things are in this one.
[54:44.65]Holy shit.
[54:55.24]Get over here, you fucking dirtball.
[55:03.92]Do a magic run and just win instantly.
[55:06.56]No!
[55:15.06]Eat more radishes to increase IQ.
[55:18.52]Fuck this.
[55:19.76]It's so fu- It's stupid.
[55:21.98]Why?
[55:23.12]It's just like a straight up fucking why.
[55:28.37]The mail breaker ain't doing shit.
[55:30.09]In fact, it's a fucking detriment.
[55:32.05]Because it's not doing as much damage as I need it to.
[55:34.99]I'm not gonna upgrade it.
[55:44.31]every time, man.
[55:49.39]Oh, fucking God.
[55:51.65]Don't you... I thought that was an alive dog.
[55:59.83]I'm putting it on like this because it is too hard to hit somebody with it when it's two-handed.
[56:03.71]And it doesn't do anything.
[56:12.33]Even when you fucking dodge, it don't matter.
[56:14.07]Even when you dodge, they still get you with the fucking last... Oh my god, it's fucking unbearable.
[56:22.01]Trying to do no shield on first Demon's Souls playthrough... Why?
[56:25.19]Is this what... What?
[56:30.41]Look, you guys gotta correct me if I'm wrong here.
[56:32.82]I always thought if you use a shield in these games, like, chat will tell you you suck.
[56:37.72]Isn't that how it works?
[56:40.05]If I go full plate mail and put a shield on, everyone's gonna laugh at me.
[56:43.59]Isn't that how this works?
[56:50.66]No.
[56:51.42]What do you mean, no?
[56:53.10]How come the rules change for the next game?
[56:58.90]Wait, we change the rules for the next game in the series?
[57:01.16]Why?
[57:03.89]Just this one is where it's okay.
[57:05.77]Are you serious?
[57:13.61]Did I miss anything?
[57:16.67]Demon's Souls is bullshit.
[57:18.03]You need a shield.
[57:20.64]Really?
[57:20.98]I didn't know.
[57:22.98]I always... I thought, like, people make fun of the fat rolling loser, like, in quotes, right?
[57:27.32]Alright.
[57:29.78]I always thought that was the general consensus.
[57:35.51]Like, oh, you fat rolling fucking loser.
[57:38.17]How dare you use a shield in a Dark Souls game?
[57:40.93]I fucking hate you.
[57:46.32]I guess this isn't a Dark Souls game, huh?
[57:49.94]I'm out of deals, by the way.
[57:54.76]So, I'm kind of like... I'm kind of screwed.
[58:00.84]We're gonna make fun of you either way.
[58:04.52]Um... Hmm.
[58:07.19]This is not good.
[58:14.04]That rolling fucking loser, how dare you.
[58:15.98]I thought he was gonna left.
[58:23.24]Where am I supposed to get grass if you don't have any left?
[58:29.28]What the fuck?
[58:40.93]Oh my god, give me a fucking break.
[58:47.37]That guy never did that.
[58:48.95]That guy never did that.
[58:52.25]I gotta go to the grocery store and buy some fucking grass.
[58:55.55]Except I don't have any money.
[58:57.71]Look, I don't have any money so I can't buy grass.
[59:00.41]I can't buy grass so I can't play the game.
[59:02.67]I can't play the game so I'm gonna have to start over.
[59:04.94]I'm gonna start over to get grass.
[59:06.76]I don't have any money so I can't get grass.
[59:08.70]I can't heal because I don't have any grass.
[59:20.79]Go farm world 4-1.
[59:22.21]Oh, I have to go back and farm?
[59:26.81]Oh, boy.
[59:27.53]Okay, let's go farm the first world.
[59:33.00]So I can have enough grass.
[59:38.48]You sure love talking about grass.
[59:39.89]You know what?
[59:40.27]You're right.
[59:44.32]You can dupe in this game?
[59:45.48]Just buy one grass and you'll be set for life.
[59:51.21]That's such a horseshit.
[59:53.71]No.
[59:54.37]No, I don't want to do any of the cheats.
[59:56.03]Everyone said do magic and kill everybody in one hit.
[59:58.37]I don't want to do that.
[59:59.17]Everyone said dupe items.
[60:01.17]I don't want to do that either.
[60:02.01]I thought everyone was going to make fun of me if I bought a shield.
[60:06.05]Because everybody made fun of me if you buy a shield in all the other games.
[60:08.93]According to people, you can't play this game without a shield because it's too hard.
[60:15.36]I'm bouncing around like a ping pong ball.
[60:16.74]I'm like a fucking... I'm like a pinball.
[60:27.64]Are you crying?
[60:29.00]What?
[60:29.94]Yeah.
[60:32.41]Quit crying.
[60:33.17]Quit crying.
[60:35.89]Get armor for fuck's sake.
[60:39.55]Where?
[60:39.81]I have to buy it from the person in here.
[60:44.16]Let's just, let's, let's, let's get some fucking shit together.
[60:49.78]Get some grass.
[60:52.56]Just aggro the whole place.
[60:58.91]Well, this is like Yharnam, right?
[61:00.51]You have to go to Yharnam and get blood vials.
[61:01.97]Yharnam.
[61:14.35]Come on.
[61:19.13]Release my feelings.
[61:27.69]Yeah, there's some more grass.
[61:31.09]Alright, I just need like 20 more of those.
[61:35.33]Go to world 4 to farm.
[61:40.82]Is that where I should go?
[61:41.46]4-1?
[61:45.04]Yeah, the game has no Estes.
[61:47.24]It's a series of different fucking paints.
[61:49.36]Yeah, okay.
[61:49.86]I'll go to 4-1.
[61:55.46]Go to World 5 to farm.
[61:59.09]I thought this guy beat Dark Souls on stream.
[62:01.17]I did.
[62:01.71]I beat Dark Souls.
[62:03.17]I'm not going to say it.
[62:04.05]I'm not going to feed in.
[62:04.77]1, 2, 3.
[62:05.71]You want me to go to World 4 to farm.
[62:09.95]This place.
[62:17.29]Isn't this the place where I was having lots of trouble?
[62:22.05]I haven't even seen this place.
[62:23.63]This is the place with the wheel enemies that I was crying over.
[62:39.06]Rolling skeletons.
[62:44.55]That's where you go to get defiled.
[62:46.10]I'm almost out of radishes.
[62:49.38]You know, when you're angry, you get angry when you're hungry, right?
[62:54.76]So, hungry, grab a radish.
[62:58.02]You know, don't eat a Snickers.
[62:59.48]Look, first of all, I don't understand that commercial.
[63:02.40]I don't understand that marketing campaign.
[63:04.86]Like, hungry, eat a Snickers?
[63:08.50]It's like a bunch of chocolate and nougat and fucking, like, it's a bunch of trash.
[63:13.80]Hey, you hungry?
[63:14.78]Eat a fucking big calorie-induced chocolate bar.
[63:18.52]No.
[63:20.00]Go make a fucking tomato and eat a tomato.
[63:23.00]Eat a couple of radishes.
[63:25.23]Don't fucking eat a candy bar if you're hungry.
[63:30.81]Hungry?
[63:31.23]Why wait?
[63:31.87]No.
[63:32.91]Don't eat a fucking candy bar.
[63:36.51]What a fucking ridiculous marketing scheme.
[63:45.81]Eat a fucking peach.
[63:51.91]Come on, do your thing.
[64:00.95]I hate how I have to hit these guys three times.
[64:04.71]I wish I could only have to hit these guys twice.
[64:07.89]And, like, I need to use the shield.
[64:09.22]No, this shield is like a little piece of crap.
[64:10.62]This is like a parry shield.
[64:12.32]I'm going to do a test here.
[64:13.16]I want to test this.
[64:15.29]I need to see what happens here.
[64:18.28]I'm gonna block this.
[64:21.98]Okay.
[64:22.28]Alright.
[64:24.14]My hypothesis is not necessarily complete.
[64:27.87]But I can, like, stop that.
[64:30.59]We're doing shield.
[64:31.27]I ain't fucking around.
[64:37.83]Watch me, like, just go through this whole place now.
[64:39.94]Here he comes.
[64:40.40]I really need to get rid of this guy, but... Whatever.
[64:45.82]Can I get rid of him before he rolls in here?
[64:49.90]Of course not.
[65:10.60]No, I'm supposed to block this with my shield!
[65:12.52]I'm supposed to block that with the shield.
[65:20.02]And I'm out again of... I'm supposed to be farming this area.
[65:27.55]My lord.
[65:35.16]I don't even have the club on me.
[65:37.66]I don't even actually have the club.
[65:44.88]I need the fucking club.
[65:45.83]I don't even have it.
[65:48.27]Yeah, this area is farming me.
[65:54.37]Well, that's still a bit damaged.
[65:55.37]Oh well.
[65:56.65]I like dove out of the way.
[65:57.79]I'm just not fucking prepared for this at all.
[65:59.61]And I'm gonna die.
[66:03.20]I need to heal to continue playing in this area, and I don't have it.
[66:07.60]I'm just gonna get this and fucking run away.
[66:12.56]Here he comes.
[66:13.28]Oh, there's no running away from you!
[66:16.80]Fucking pig person.
[66:23.22]This just shows the infinite stamina that these enemies have.
[66:27.09]Do enemies have stamina bars in these games?
[66:29.29]How old this one is?
[66:30.64]Or will he do this forever?
[66:31.66]And it doesn't matter.
[66:32.26]He can do it fucking forever.
[66:36.12]I almost just got hit in the face by that.
[66:43.70]Don't use your shield, you fucking nerd.
[66:50.09]Enemies have infinite stamina.
[66:53.89]Gotta go fast.
[66:55.84]None of the Souls games do, but, yeah, they do.
[66:57.50]They have, like, an internal fake stamina bar.
[67:01.28]At least I can level up once.
[67:04.04]I'm gonna go do that.
[67:08.48]I'm gonna go put a point in, like, strength or something.
[67:13.74]Um... Where did she go?
[67:21.39]Isn't she, like, just hanging out?
[67:22.19]Oh, there she is.
[67:27.17]Soul power.
[67:28.67]Um... I could do like a quality build, couldn't I?
[67:34.24]Alright, we're going for it.
[67:39.70]I'm just gonna use all my consumables.
[67:45.54]Like, fuck it.
[67:47.90]Add to the user's soul stock.
[67:50.12]Just use them all.
[67:51.01]Let's get like, let's get... Let's fucking do it.
[67:53.11]I don't even care.
[67:56.88]I don't want to use that yet.
[67:59.91]I was going to hold on to these, but no.
[68:01.55]We're not doing that.
[68:14.16]Single digit stats.
[68:17.02]Can I use more than one, or is that not in this game?
[68:23.70]Use... I guess I have to do these one at a time.
[68:29.04]Do the boss souls work similar in this game too?
[68:39.21]Just put it on your hotbar?
[68:40.01]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[68:49.68]Smash it.
[68:53.99]They're just for shitty you- so did they- have FromSoftware ever made a game where the boss soul gave you a good weapon that wasn't just for one specific place in PvP?
[69:02.31]Alright, I can level up like seven fucking times.
[69:07.57]So I want to make sure I get this correct.
[69:09.19]We're gonna do this right.
[69:13.37]Seek soul power.
[69:14.59]I have enough for probably like six or seven levels.
[69:18.50]So do I get dex to like 15 and strength to 20?
[69:21.40]Or should I just keep strength going?
[69:23.43]What do you guys think?
[69:25.53]No, we're not doing magic.
[69:26.55]Not doing magic.
[69:29.23]All into strength.
[69:30.89]Buy some armor.
[69:37.23]Strength, vitality, endurance.
[69:38.51]Just keep it going.
[69:39.67]We're already this far.
[69:42.52]Quality, quality, quality, quality.
[69:48.02]Just put one in the decks.
[69:53.23]Strength and armor get some bite.
[69:54.63]I know I'm going to want at least one in Endurance.
[69:57.97]I want at least two in Endurance, for sure.
[70:03.53]Maximum strength for maximum gameplay.
[70:10.26]Luck is actually really useful in certain builds.
[70:14.71]Let's get to at least double digit dexterity.
[70:17.63]So, like, I can fucking pick up a weapon and use it if I need to.
[70:22.44]And then we're gonna go all strength.
[70:27.56]Get this to 20.
[70:27.94]Put one in vitality.
[70:30.18]And that's it.
[70:39.72]Enough dex for pickaxe than strength.
[70:43.16]I think I got it.
[70:47.83]I'm getting so many conflicting opinions.
[70:49.81]I'm just, I'm just too many opinions.
[70:52.55]You know what I mean?
[70:53.29]Like, there's too many opinions.
[70:54.57]I see so many opinions in chat.
[70:56.03]I like, I gotta stop looking for opinions.
[71:00.87]Why didn't I buy grass?
[71:01.98]Fuck.
[71:03.68]It's alright, everybody calm down.
[71:10.52]Pickaxe.
[71:18.13]It's alright.
[71:18.79]We're gonna be fine.
[71:25.37]I can use the scimitar.
[71:26.69]Wait, I can use this now.
[71:27.69]What about this baby?
[71:32.45]Time to restart.
[71:36.78]Curve sword.
[71:37.44]I could put this on and put a shield on.
[71:41.54]Soldier C shield.
[71:47.37]No Wikipedia.
[71:49.36]I don't have Wikipedia.
[71:50.44]Yeah, I... No, what do you mean I don't have Wikipedia?
[71:57.64]Curved... Wait, what?
[71:59.15]That's a curved sword.
[72:03.35]Curved sword.
[72:04.99]Is that not good?
[72:06.45]No shield equals... Shield equals no skill.
[72:14.61]I'm doing it blind.
[72:16.39]Um, I'm just gonna... I should have bought the fucking armor.
[72:19.99]God damn it.
[72:20.79]I'm just too... I'm too all over the place.
[72:22.67]This is why I liked Bloodborne so much.
[72:26.19]Because, like, all it was was just playing the game.
[72:27.85]Not, like, all this min-maxing and fucking items and, like, thousands of different builds.
[72:31.69]It's too much for my brain.
[72:33.31]I was really good at dodging and attacking.
[72:34.87]And that's all I had to worry about.
[72:37.80]There's like 400 items in Dark Souls 3.
[72:39.94]It's too much.
[72:41.44]And all of them are the same item.
[72:42.96]Dark Souls items.
[72:44.30]There's like 10 different swords and only one of them is worth equipping.
[72:53.57]I'm just going to put the axe back on.
[72:55.95]I'm like leveled up now a little bit more.
[72:57.79]I'm not like a total joke.
[73:01.20]I'll do more damage here.
[73:05.11]That's why Bloodborne is for kids?
[73:06.30]Bloodborne was fucking excruciatingly difficult.
[73:08.68]What are you talking about?
[73:11.50]Orphan of Kos was the hardest boss I've ever fought in a video game.
[73:14.28]He was crazy.
[73:15.36]Give me a break.
[73:17.16]Okay, let me make sure this is all... No interest, eh?
[73:24.09]I can tell...
[73:28.38]Hello, I'm... What else do I want?
[73:31.34]I think I want to take that shield, that soldier.
[73:32.98]I'm going to take the soldier shield.
[73:35.30]Deposit the one I have.
[73:39.76]Where is it?
[73:42.78]It's equipped.
[73:44.66]Is it better?
[73:45.18]I guess it's like... Whatever.
[73:47.93]You have a...
[73:50.29]Whatever, let's just go.
[73:50.93]This took too much information for me to take in right now.
[73:54.81]How big is this?
[73:56.15]Okay, whatever.
[73:59.79]You force-tried orphan.
[74:02.21]That's a lie.
[74:03.39]I don't believe it for a second.
[74:07.48]Now, let's go to... Let's go here.
[74:10.58]I'm just gonna go backwards from here.
[74:17.22]I don't have any grass.
[74:24.88]I gotta get the pickaxe.
[74:29.23]It's just like... I don't know.
[74:31.87]I feel like in this game, you have to switch weapons.
[74:36.17]It wasn't really like that in the other ones, was it?
[74:38.29]Not that I can remember.
[74:40.98]Needing to have two or three different weapons.
[74:42.78]You have to have piercing in this area.
[74:44.10]You have to have blunt in this area.
[74:46.02]You could kind of just do whatever you wanted.
[74:50.41]I gotta like stop and like let my ADD like shut the fuck up for a second so I can like do and just just just not autopilot.
[74:59.52]You can't autopilot a Souls game.
[75:01.42]And that's what I do when I play games.
[75:02.52]I fucking go on complete autopilot.
[75:07.19]Like no autopilot.
[75:09.45]I have to pay attention.
[75:10.99]And when I play games, I turn on fucking autopilot.
[75:13.41]You cannot do that while you play these games.
[75:15.75]What am I thinking?
[75:18.14]I need to sit down and shut my fucking mouth and actually figure out what I'm gonna do.
[75:24.14]Like right now.
[75:24.96]I shouldn't be talking right now.
[75:26.67]I should not be speaking.
[75:29.13]This is a grass run.
[75:38.52]Grass run?
[75:39.44]We've already lost all of our fucking health, so this is great.
[75:49.14]I actually need to buy stuff too.
[75:50.38]Oh, what a disaster.
[75:53.64]I'm gonna die.
[75:55.38]I'm like fucking dead here.
[76:03.65]God.
[76:03.75]Just need to hit them once.
[76:13.49]Nobody had anything?
[76:15.67]None of you guys had one thing on you?
[76:18.69]If I die to a torch man, I, yeah, I know, like, like, no way.
[76:27.07]Uh... He's gonna come back again.
[76:39.28]Better to buy grass from souls in 4-1.
[76:40.90]Probably.
[76:48.55]Let's just restart this place.
[76:52.72]I'm getting high on my own supply.
[76:56.38]Blind means I don't have any eyes?
[76:57.62]No, blind just means I literally have no idea what is going on in this game.
[77:02.62]Not a single fucking clue.
[77:09.20]Like, I may as well just tape my eyes shut when I play this game.
[77:15.93]Um, okay.
[77:17.31]I gotta fucking calm down and, like, my brain needs to start working.
[77:19.74]Jesus Christ.
[77:23.22]I wanna go look at this other zone.
[77:25.38]I'm just curious.
[77:26.90]At this point, this is, like, a trying to find, like, my curiosity.
[77:32.33]I wanna see this place.
[77:33.25]We have not seen this place.
[77:34.11]I just wanna see it.
[77:43.89]brave blind streamer attempts to play world's hardest game playing a souls game not blind on the first time is a waste uh I mean that's how I played all the other ones with maybe like very specific things
[78:12.78]That I would look up.
[78:14.38]Or, like, walk through type stuff.
[78:17.60]But I guess I, like, underestimate that with this game.
[78:20.06]Because this is, like, the first one.
[78:22.60]And... Obviously, they made, like, improvements to how, like, things worked.
[78:26.16]As they continued to make these games.
[78:30.90]So... Maybe it's not a bad idea to look up a few things.
[78:33.80]Like, for instance.
[78:34.92]Like, for instance, there's, like, a day-night cycle that makes the game harder.
[78:37.86]Right?
[78:38.86]Somebody told me that.
[78:39.58]And that's the world tendency thing.
[78:41.30]Is that, like, what I'm...
[78:43.24]Is that the fucking day-night cycle thing that, like, somebody told me about?
[78:48.47]Like, this is Minecraft, but the game gets harder at night.
[78:51.19]What is that?
[78:51.61]That's bullshit.
[79:03.31]Oh boy, this place is dangerous.
[79:09.23]Well, at least I got some souls here.
[79:12.64]Oh, it's doing that thing again, though.
[79:13.88]Can I drop down here?
[79:24.04]At least I have some guaranteed souls.
[79:28.97]The valley of three FPS.
[79:30.51]It does feel that way.
[79:41.68]Oh no, not this again.
[79:43.41]Have I been playing for more than an hour?
[79:46.65]That's when this happens.
[79:51.59]Was this a fucking SEGA CD game?
[79:59.91]What's down here?
[80:00.55]Is there a person right there?
[80:01.81]Yeah, there is.
[80:06.37]Drop down.
[80:07.01]Get down.
[80:10.88]It's narrow, narrow, narrow, narrow.
[80:13.42]What kind of... What the hell?
[80:14.76]Give me a... You don't have anything.
[80:20.83]Why do you guys have shit?
[80:24.99]What is a royal lotus?
[80:26.79]Heals, uses bleeding.
[80:27.91]Heal from poison.
[80:29.75]I know this is going to be a poison zone.
[80:31.80]I'm certain of that by now.
[80:36.22]Can I not?
[80:37.60]I thought that was like a snoozing enemy.
[80:39.46]It's not.
[80:41.00]Alright, well, good to know.
[80:45.50]This is not good.
[80:50.59]Worst comes to worst, I use that thing by some grass.
[80:55.13]Going into World 5 with no grass.
[80:57.91]What a mistake, huh?
[80:59.85]No, no shield.
[81:00.61]It's not going to be even worth it at this point.
[81:02.23]Not here.
[81:02.59]This is not good.
[81:04.31]Okay.
[81:04.61]I don't know what he does.
[81:09.42]He's yucky.
[81:09.78]He's got the fire poker.
[81:12.76]Holy shit.
[81:17.62]Ow.
[81:20.39]I gotta go into offline.
[81:21.45]This fucking, like, CD skip bullshit is seriously kind of Mason- Mason me.
[81:31.07]It's- I'm getting- How do I turn off the fucking online mode?
[81:34.24]So I don't, like, go into, like, a stuttering eight frames a second.
[81:37.26]Like, holy god.
[81:43.46]How do I remove the fucking Walkman disk skip player?
[81:51.99]Online has nothing to do with it?
[81:52.97]Somebody told me that that's what happened.
[81:57.81]I'm sitting here doing inputs and my CD fucking is skipping.
[82:00.81]I don't even have a CD in the fucking tray.
[82:02.53]It's a digital copy.
[82:08.99]Get me out of this fucking online mode.
[82:10.93]That's what I was told is the problem.
[82:13.79]Somebody said, you can't be online, it'll do that.
[82:16.09]I don't think I can even turn that off.
[82:24.03]One person in chat told me something.
[82:28.09]You know, you're right.
[82:28.87]You know, when you're right, you're right.
[82:30.05]And you're right.
[82:34.92]How much is this?
[82:35.46]It's a thousand.
[82:38.50]That's enough for me to buy, like, four.
[82:46.01]Turn down brightness.
[82:47.25]No.
[82:49.37]Unplug the router.
[82:51.09]Well, let's just go.
[82:52.01]I have to say, I was progressing in the second area.
[82:57.34]And then I had a fucking meltdown.
[83:01.38]And I don't even know what's happened since.
[83:07.76]Let me buy some fucking grass.
[83:09.47]And we're going to go back to the second area.
[83:17.06]Does it give me six crescent moon grass?
[83:20.06]That does not seem like very much.
[83:26.45]It's happening here now, too.
[83:29.11]I'm going to have to restart the game.
[83:31.51]That seemed to have worked last time.
[83:34.39]Give me one sec.
[83:43.20]Tear the foundation from your home.
[83:44.50]It might work.
[83:46.27]Why is the audio glitchy?
[83:47.88]The game is stuttering.
[83:49.82]And that happened last time too.
[83:51.50]It happened after pretty much the same amount of time.
[83:53.24]Playing for like an hour or two, right?
[83:56.88]Dupe the grass.
[83:57.74]No, everyone will see me as a cheater.
[83:59.06]And then I'll get banned from Demon's Souls.
[84:02.31]If you duped in Diablo II, you were gone.
[84:04.89]I'm not doing that.
[84:08.45]Thought I was out of radishes?
[84:09.69]Nope.
[84:24.64]Did I have a meltdown?
[84:25.42]Yeah.
[84:28.58]I had a fucking meltdown.
[84:30.40]Like, 40 minutes ago.
[84:33.60]Wait, you can eat radishes?
[84:34.74]Yeah.
[84:34.98]Are the radishes the things that are fucking me up?
[84:43.66]Might be.
[84:47.14]Now that I think about it, I was playing well and doing fine progressing until I started eating radishes.
[84:51.91]Don't eat them.
[84:52.95]Buy a Snickers.
[84:53.53]Eat a candy.
[84:59.59]Thank you, JKLaser, for the bits.
[85:00.93]Jeremy, you missed my last question.
[85:02.33]It was of utmost importance and urgency.
[85:05.11]Okay, what was it?
[85:07.59]JKLaser for $5.
[85:08.69]Hey, Jeremy, since you're so... Do you have a... Something about my asshole.
[85:16.35]I don't know.
[85:18.59]Thanks for the six bucks.
[85:20.85]Something about my asshole.
[85:21.77]I don't know what it was.
[85:23.63]Muse, thanks for the $5.
[85:25.69]I know you try to be the best, yet you're only a man.
[85:28.99]However, a man's got to learn to take it.
[85:31.37]You're trying to believe, however, the going is getting rough.
[85:34.51]But I know in my heart you'll succeed in Demon's Souls.
[85:37.71]You're the best around.
[85:39.11]Thank you.
[85:41.37]Thank you, Muse.
[85:43.57]Encouragement.
[85:44.03]That's what we need.
[85:45.79]Is this still loading?
[85:47.91]Thank you, Nick, for the $1.
[85:49.28]It's a bummer it was never...
[85:51.01]It was a bummer I never got to see you play Bloodborne on stream.
[85:53.33]Such a good game.
[85:54.03]Also, I remember Ster's story when you first saw the spider in Nightmare of Immensis.
[85:59.83]Oh, it's terrifying.
[86:00.51]I fucking hated it.
[86:02.63]I actually got scared.
[86:03.79]And it, like, hurt my body.
[86:08.31]What's with this radish shit?
[86:11.07]Never trust purple.
[86:11.61]Thanks for the five dollars.
[86:13.61]Good to see everyone's favorite streamer shilling for the radish company.
[86:15.96]Eat them.
[86:16.42]They're good.
[86:20.90]Bam, two, two, two.
[86:21.70]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[86:22.46]Looking forward to the stream.
[86:23.46]Made my day.
[86:24.06]Thanks, Jerma.
[86:26.48]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[86:28.20]People are saying like, oh, thanks for the stream.
[86:30.23]Thanks for live.
[86:30.67]Really was looking forward to this.
[86:31.83]And like, I haven't progressed.
[86:33.09]I haven't done anything in like 38 minutes.
[86:35.81]It's been me complaining about radishes and Snickers and dying.
[86:39.71]I haven't done a damn thing, but I have upgraded my character.
[86:42.55]I have leveled up like seven times.
[86:44.93]I guess I have progressed.
[86:50.71]Thanks for the radish.
[86:53.64]Alright.
[86:54.22]Let me equip my shit.
[86:55.82]Let's go.
[86:56.78]Time to fucking rock and roll.
[86:57.94]You know what I mean?
[86:59.96]No more of this dog shit.
[87:02.02]I leveled this character up.
[87:04.60]We're just going back to where I was.
[87:06.80]We're gonna keep progressing.
[87:09.21]No, just hold my tongue.
[87:12.97]Get through it.
[87:13.57]I opened up the door already.
[87:15.03]I already progressed through like half of this fucking level already.
[87:19.22]This one.
[87:20.00]So just do it.
[87:21.08]Just keep going.
[87:21.60]I opened the door.
[87:22.82]I already opened up the fucking door.
[87:24.74]I don't have the pickaxe yet.
[87:26.20]I can't do it yet.
[87:27.13]We're just going to have to go with what we got.
[87:36.47]We're just going to have to use what we got.
[87:43.59]And watch.
[87:44.53]Now that I've got that out of my system, I had all my radishes.
[87:46.92]They're all gone.
[87:48.39]Still have a little bit of my coffee left.
[87:53.73]We're gonna be fine.
[87:58.61]Just gonna play, we're gonna play it right.
[88:01.05]I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna, like, look, this is what happens to me.
[88:04.67]When I get locked into a game, and I'm enjoying myself, like, this game's fun.
[88:09.41]But when I get frustrated, and I get stuck and frustrated, and, like, there's a lot of information, like, overwhelming information...
[88:17.13]I get stuck.
[88:18.29]And I start to not know what to do.
[88:20.23]And I start to freak out.
[88:21.51]No more freaking out.
[88:22.17]We're done with that.
[88:22.75]We got it out of our system.
[88:24.95]Now let's just kill enemies in Demon's Souls.
[88:29.99]Don't complain about the dogs.
[88:30.95]Just get them in the first hit.
[88:33.01]It's not that big of a deal.
[88:40.90]I'm prepared now.
[88:46.07]We're just gonna get it going.
[88:48.13]Already fucked up.
[88:49.37]Don't get angry.
[88:52.31]No, it's happening again.
[88:55.67]Why is this happening still?
[89:00.54]No, we're supposed to not be angry.
[89:02.48]Why are we doing the CD skip thing again?
[89:04.56]What the fuck?
[89:06.78]Ugh!
[89:09.52]What in the name of God?
[89:11.14]Damn it!
[89:13.41]I can't play the game like this.
[89:20.49]You've got to be fucking shitting me.
[89:25.71]You've actually got to be fucking kidding me.
[89:32.79]It's definitely, like, my, like, my PS3 is probably, like, old and overheating.
[89:37.54]Wouldn't be surprising.
[89:42.00]You want to, radishes are good.
[89:43.46]Yeah, I highly recommend you try them.
[89:50.92]Have I tried blowing on it?
[89:52.90]Give me a fucking break.
[89:54.72]Stop this shit.
[89:55.64]It's a digital copy of the fucking game.
[89:59.82]This is not good.
[90:01.68]You see this shit?
[90:04.65]Are you kidding me?
[90:05.91]Oh, I'm so angry right now.
[90:07.07]This is supposed to be no anger.
[90:19.26]My PlayStation 3 is just, like, dying.
[90:22.18]Great.
[90:23.86]Fucking great.
[90:33.30]And somehow, I'm, like, not dead.
[90:46.35]Ah.
[90:53.98]Stop it, please.
[90:59.24]I just- I'm gonna have to just get in here.
[91:01.51]Just get in here.
[91:07.92]Any more?
[91:08.30]He's dead.
[91:10.72]Just get me to like a shortcut or something.
[91:16.27]It's not gonna stop till I reload the game.
[91:17.75]I... I... I mean, I... I just turned off my PlayStation 3 five minutes ago and restarted the whole system.
[91:26.43]If that didn't work, then what the hell would?
[91:27.94]He's gonna dive down the stairs.
[91:45.86]Nah, he's dead.
[91:48.99]Problem with the game, no fixed solution.
[91:50.75]I could just run by him.
[91:58.01]In fact, I'm going to.
[91:58.85]No reason to fight that guy.
[92:00.90]Alright, just get into the other room.
[92:03.38]Forget about the salamanders.
[92:05.72]Forget about the fucking salamanders and just keep progressing like I was before.
[92:13.51]Just put a microwave towel on the PlayStation 3.
[92:18.06]Just microwave your PlayStation 3 for like 10 minutes.
[92:20.56]It'll be fine.
[92:21.06]Put it on 30 minutes and microwave it.
[92:24.76]Okay, here we go.
[92:25.46]Just progress.
[92:26.82]Kill this dumb thing.
[92:29.54]We got this last time.
[92:30.46]It was easy.
[92:31.11]Except I can't hit him.
[92:34.35]I can't fucking hit this enemy now.
[92:35.95]Like, he's too low to the ground.
[92:37.49]I cannot swing at him.
[92:38.81]So I'm just gonna go by him.
[92:41.23]Fuck it.
[92:51.58]Just pour milk on him.
[92:52.76]I'm about to.
[92:55.50]I love how I'm getting to an area that I haven't seen yet, and we get to play like this.
[92:59.92]This is gonna get me killed, and I'm going to- I'm going to smash my fist down on the PlayStation 3.
[93:05.63]This is not my fault.
[93:06.75]This is not- You can say that I'm bad at a video game all you want.
[93:09.33]That's fine.
[93:10.47]This shit is not my fault.
[93:12.71]If I die because of this dumb shit, you know why.
[93:15.31]And I'm gonna put my fist down into the PlayStation 3.
[93:17.53]And then we're gonna have to play another game.
[93:23.58]God damn it.
[93:24.44]I could like... This is the way to go.
[93:30.99]Okay, this is... Yeah, this is getting to be unbearable.
[93:39.45]It is.
[93:40.13]It's been at that point already.
[93:49.15]What the fuck?
[93:50.71]Come on.
[93:53.72]I think the game is, like, fucking breaking.
[93:56.06]Why did they stop moving?
[94:06.30]Come on, dude.
[94:07.44]Why?
[94:07.84]Why?
[94:09.30]Does it have anything to heal?
[94:12.53]Ugh.
[94:12.63]I need to, like, blow on my PlayStation 3.
[94:20.17]There's a fog gate here.
[94:24.08]what what is happening get him just open the fog gate and just come up here and like is there like a short oh
[94:52.22]Fucking piece of shit PS3, man.
[94:56.96]Why is it doing this shit?
[94:58.76]Like, if I just had the health, if I didn't get hit like the six times from my fucking PS3 being a piece of shit, that fucking would never have happened.
[95:08.12]The shortcut was right there.
[95:15.32]Fucking goddammit.
[95:18.16]Give me a second.
[95:24.71]Pile of fucking crap.
[95:27.37]This is like, this is the PS3 Slim, by the way.
[95:29.75]This is like the new one that they made.
[95:31.11]Nothing even fucking in here.
[95:37.14]And it's not even hot.
[95:39.34]This thing is like... Okay, you know when your dog is sleeping in his bed?
[95:46.02]And you put your, like, hand on, like, where the dog was sleeping?
[95:50.48]That's how warm this is.
[95:51.90]That's not that warm.
[95:53.04]It's dog bed warm.
[95:58.40]Pile of fucking crap You don't have a dog your cat Don't smash your fist on it.
[96:14.28]We were right there too, and I knew we were and I can get back This is just an added added issue I'm gonna get an ice pack and like put it on top.
[96:23.87]Oh
[96:26.54]Remind yourself.
[96:27.14]Okay, I'm gonna like delete some shit.
[96:28.40]How do you delete shit on PlayStation 3?
[96:33.00]No, I don't want to install Metal Gear VR.
[96:36.78]How do I delete it?
[96:37.94]No, don't install it.
[96:38.94]Delete it.
[96:44.10]How do you delete shit?
[96:47.07]Right, like how do I delete these to like free up some space?
[96:53.09]Turn off the online mode.
[96:54.19]I don't know how to do that.
[97:00.49]Have to micro disconnect PSN from the internet and delete from hard drive.
[97:05.97]Triangle.
[97:06.37]Alright, Metal Gear Solid.
[97:08.67]Delete.
[97:10.00]Yes, I'm sure I want to delete this.
[97:11.14]And I'm going to sign out of PSN.
[97:15.04]Delete this.
[97:16.42]What is it?
[97:16.70]What's in here?
[97:17.72]Delete it.
[97:20.20]Metal Gear VR missions.
[97:21.46]Delete it.
[97:23.72]This is from a video I made like a year and a half ago.
[97:26.64]Okay, we're good.
[97:29.12]What have we got?
[97:29.84]PlayStation 3.
[97:30.36]Alright, delete it.
[97:37.26]This is 5,000 megabytes.
[97:43.44]This is the problem.
[97:47.73]Why is this taking so long?
[97:48.55]Look at this.
[97:49.39]5-12-2016 at 1.20 p.m.
[97:57.65]See?
[97:58.41]That was the problem.
[97:59.31]Remember the Wonder Book games?
[98:03.05]Look at this.
[98:05.68]6-12-2015.
[98:05.98]Then I'm signing out of PSN.
[98:16.18]No, no, play what?
[98:17.80]No, my Wonder Book is gone.
[98:20.45]It's the game, not the console.
[98:21.81]Oh well.
[98:24.87]It belongs in a museum.
[98:29.42]Stop destroying history.
[98:32.24]You think hard drive space is the issue?
[98:34.28]I'm just trying to cover my bases here.
[98:40.10]It's not the console.
[98:41.28]I was playing... You saw the games.
[98:43.54]We've been playing PlayStation 3 for like a week.
[98:45.39]Remember Kung Fu Live?
[98:47.05]I'll keep that one.
[98:50.57]Sign out of PSN.
[98:51.45]I don't even know how to do that.
[98:53.65]Internet.
[98:56.29]Internet.
[98:58.45]Okay.
[98:58.83]PlayStation Now.
[98:59.99]Just get out of here.
[99:04.01]Anybody know how to sign out of PlayStation Now?
[99:05.89]I'm just going to turn off the internet.
[99:07.60]Network settings.
[99:08.28]Just turn it off.
[99:10.20]Internet connection.
[99:11.16]Disabled.
[99:14.42]Good.
[99:16.20]I'm ready.
[99:19.39]Demon's Souls.
[99:20.33]Disabled internet connection.
[99:22.11]I'm ready to play the game now.
[99:31.06]I'm not an EDT with this accent.
[99:33.48]I'm an East Coast.
[99:39.52]Delete your skills instead.
[99:40.60]They're not taking a lot of... Get that guy out of here.
[99:43.55]Get that guy out of here.
[99:45.55]I never want to see that name again.
[99:47.45]That's a permanent removal.
[99:49.19]That's a permanent fucking removal.
[99:50.79]Never want to see that guy's name again.
[99:53.26]Nine seconds.
[100:04.92]modem.
[100:07.76]Quit using a shield.
[100:08.88]I can't do this.
[100:11.16]This is what I'm talking about, guys.
[100:12.44]It's because you're using a shield, you fucking idiot.
[100:16.94]And I put the shield on.
[100:17.90]Take that shield off.
[100:19.78]Put that shield back on, Jeremy.
[100:21.28]It works.
[100:22.18]Get that fucking shield off.
[100:24.54]Why are you not doing a quality build?
[100:26.75]Dex loser.
[100:28.73]It's just total... You guys are all in my head.
[100:32.75]All of you.
[100:33.03]There's so many voices in my head.
[100:37.35]Deck sucks.
[100:38.35]No, it doesn't.
[100:38.71]It does, it does.
[100:40.68]Strength builds are for fucking losers.
[100:43.60]Is it?
[100:43.98]No, it's not.
[100:44.44]Shut up.
[100:45.98]You're not even good at this game.
[100:46.97]You're bad.
[100:47.39]You're not even good at games.
[100:48.65]I am, I am.
[100:51.53]You should quit streaming forever.
[100:52.97]Don't say that.
[101:05.35]the voices stop the voices stop the voices Jerma is Harvey dent when you're right you're right hey come on don't don't come on be at least like five percent nice to me
[101:32.54]I had a rough day.
[101:33.42]I used all my fucking moon grass.
[101:39.27]I think I'll still be fine.
[101:40.15]I just gotta get to where I was.
[101:41.25]Don't fuck around.
[101:42.33]Just be easy.
[101:43.95]And I didn't even get hit by that.
[101:45.19]There was no pixel there.
[101:46.13]I got hit by the... No animation was gone.
[101:49.39]And it still hurt me.
[101:50.43]It still hurt me.
[101:52.21]We just gotta get by the dogs and then run.
[101:55.63]Get by the dogs and run.
[101:58.03]That's what we're gonna do.
[102:00.14]I'm gonna try it.
[102:01.30]You have to try.
[102:06.87]Get by the fucking dogs.
[102:10.18]And run.
[102:14.60]That didn't, that didn't kill him!
[102:16.18]Every dog, every dog, every dog, every dog was one hit!
[102:19.18]And it didn't hit him.
[102:22.26]How dare you!
[102:24.41]They were one hit every time, except for now.
[102:26.43]And I have no grass to heal!
[102:41.03]Why does that guy have to be right fucking there?
[102:42.89]Like, does he actually have to do what?
[102:44.41]Why is he there?
[102:47.33]He doesn't have to be there.
[102:48.61]They put him strategically so you can't go that way.
[102:52.10]And that guy is gonna fuck you every time.
[102:57.80]This guy just fucks you every time.
[103:01.08]There's no solution.
[103:09.40]There's no solution.
[103:15.30]Oh, my fucking god.
[103:19.04]I have to, like, move him.
[103:20.01]Just get out of the fucking way.
[103:20.81]Okay, fine.
[103:22.15]Just don't follow me.
[103:23.49]Is he following me?
[103:30.45]God damn it!
[103:30.97]There's a guy behind me now!
[103:37.00]Dude, this is why they added the fucking Estus.
[103:45.68]Because holy shit, blood vials were so easy to get in Bloodborne.
[103:51.33]They're so easy, they drop off a fucking like 90% of every enemy in the game.
[103:57.59]Without an Estus Flask, this game is fucking a chore.
[104:02.81]And I'm already at half health from this shit.
[104:11.05]I'm just running into a fucking wall over and over again because the healing item is fucking stupid in this game.
[104:19.56]And the ones that drop heal like fucking 9% of your HP bar.
[104:24.50]What the fuck?
[104:27.30]I'm so dead.
[104:27.82]It doesn't even fucking matter.
[104:30.24]Nothing matters.
[104:30.78]I'm dead.
[104:36.31]And why is the green gas... Why is it fucking like 10% of your health pool?
[104:46.30]Give me a break, man.
[104:48.03]Give me a fucking break.
[105:09.03]Should've touched the blood pool for my, like, 108 souls.
[105:12.81]Two hours?
[105:13.15]Yeah, we got two hours in the same area, because I got to a point where I ran out of healing.
[105:17.83]And even trying to go farm for other healing is, like, I can't, it's not working.
[105:21.47]I'm just gonna go fucking this way.
[105:30.04]I've been in the exact situation you are in right now, and I've restarted the game and made a Dex character.
[105:35.02]Are you serious?
[105:36.88]Well, thank you for the 10 bucks.
[105:39.90]I appreciate it, Steady Shoe.
[105:44.62]Is that what I have to do?
[105:52.00]Have I tried not taking damage?
[105:54.06]Good luck.
[105:54.46]I have to restart with magic.
[106:06.75]Unironically restart and do magic.
[106:10.27]Yeah, I'm like five hours into the game and I'm still in the second area.
[106:18.89]This game is comparable to Bloodborne with farming the healing items, right?
[106:22.20]I talked about this before.
[106:23.68]Doing Yharnam in Bloodborne took like six minutes and you got like 12 blood vials every time.
[106:36.51]I did that first area back there and got one 10% heal.
[106:41.27]Why?
[106:41.45]If you're gonna have a consumable heal in the game, it should be fucking everywhere.
[106:45.30]Like, EVERYWHERE.
[106:46.28]I'm just gonna move this way.
[106:56.66]I'm just curious.
[106:57.24]I wanna know what's down here.
[107:01.05]This is what you call artificial difficulty.
[107:03.01]Learn from this.
[107:04.37]Now, all the following Souls games are generally hard, but they gave... I missed that message, but... I mean, like, it should be everywhere.
[107:09.67]It should be dropping from these guys.
[107:11.41]It should be, like, a fucking 50% drop rate on these guys.
[107:19.15]And, like, already, like, I'm taking hits.
[107:20.81]Because the game is black.
[107:28.62]You should be able to get grass from cutting the grass on the ground.
[107:30.90]Ha ha ha.
[107:40.43]What even up here?
[107:41.13]This is like the second part of the first world.
[107:44.88]What's that?
[107:50.10]Oh, three half-moon grass.
[107:51.46]Good.
[107:51.76]Like, I need to use it now.
[107:54.98]That should be ten.
[107:57.62]Shit.
[107:58.50]Motherfucker, that should be like thirty.
[108:02.24]What's up here?
[108:02.68]There's not gonna be a dragon up here, is there?
[108:08.02]It's gonna be a dragon.
[108:09.76]Now I'm gonna scream.
[108:14.30]I can already hear it!
[108:14.94]I CAN HEAR IT!
[108:15.38]I CAN ALREADY HEAR IT!
[108:17.12]Jesus Christ!
[108:18.08]I only have three healing items.
[108:38.63]Did he come back?
[108:39.35]Or is he done?
[108:40.09]Did he do another pass?
[108:41.09]Don't... Don't do another pass.
[108:42.73]There's an item on the ground.
[108:43.71]It might be... It might be two crescent moon grass.
[108:50.72]I don't even know where he is.
[108:51.92]It's not worth it.
[108:52.78]I don't even care.
[108:54.00]I have 168 souls.
[108:54.98]Just get this item.
[108:57.87]It was... I got it.
[108:58.57]It was grass.
[109:03.19]I don't care.
[109:03.63]We're fine.
[109:09.10]It was grass.
[109:09.66]We got it.
[109:10.00]I don't even care that I died.
[109:15.19]Why is that shield out?
[109:19.53]It was worth it.
[109:20.37]I have six healing things that I'm going to waste.
[109:23.49]Grass was worth it.
[109:29.36]It was only one.
[109:30.24]God damn it.
[109:31.72]Come on.
[109:34.34]Come on.
[109:35.10]Why?
[109:38.42]Give me a fucking... Whatever.
[109:45.35]One fucking grass.
[109:46.33]It should be like 20.
[109:47.21]Mm-hmm.
[110:00.10]One blade of grass, yeah.
[110:07.28]Don't you think these guys should have a higher drop rate for this shit?
[110:10.76]Even the crappy one.
[110:12.44]Even the one that is awful.
[110:16.36]This is where I would go back and farm.
[110:17.80]It's like these guys.
[110:19.58]But they don't ever drop this shit.
[110:22.80]So I have to go to a hard area that has difficult enemies to farm the grass I need to do the easier area.
[110:30.43]What?
[110:40.10]Just go get the shield that's in 4-1?
[110:41.36]I don't know.
[110:41.84]There's a lot of stuff.
[110:45.52]What is that?
[110:46.44]Grass?
[110:51.39]Might be grass over there.
[110:52.69]How do I get down there?
[110:54.21]I want to go down there.
[110:57.63]That could be grass.
[111:01.32]I'm starting to understand why people dupe in this fucking game.
[111:04.22]Like, I'm starting to get it.
[111:07.60]I'm starting to understand why, like, in the very beginning, somebody was like, dude, just dupe.
[111:10.86]This game's dumb.
[111:11.94]And I'm like, wait, what?
[111:13.08]Now I get it!
[111:22.25]Just roleplaying as a cow?
[111:23.29]No.
[111:23.57]Yeah.
[111:30.52]Well, let's go see if there's grass down there.
[111:35.24]Google hack for duping grass.
[111:45.69]Not one.
[111:46.89]Oh, we got one.
[111:49.41]Happy.
[111:52.95]Can I open this?
[111:55.71]No.
[111:58.97]Just play Bloodborne already.
[112:04.57]No, I've already beaten Bloodborne like fucking four times.
[112:14.61]Go get the healing shield.
[112:15.81]Well... I think I have enough to get to the shortcut.
[112:20.31]I hope I do, at least.
[112:23.95]Not with my tendency?
[112:24.93]No.
[112:29.10]Well, let's just go.
[112:35.36]On New Game Plus?
[112:36.30]I played through New Game Plus once.
[112:37.46]Did I even... Did I beat New Game Plus?
[112:43.21]I'm not sure I actually completed New Game Plus.
[112:46.45]But I went through the game with like four different characters.
[112:51.19]Okay.
[112:54.70]I'm going to follow the advice and I'm going to do 4-1.
[112:58.04]And I'm going to try to not fucking die.
[113:00.04]I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[113:05.81]Thankfully the frame skipping shit is gone.
[113:07.99]So that's good.
[113:13.79]Go play Nioh?
[113:14.55]I wasn't a big fan of Nioh.
[113:19.89]Go get your club before... Ah, fuck.
[113:35.02]Just kill the skeletons you can like three times and get souls.
[113:39.38]I need my club.
[113:42.66]That's because I was drunk?
[113:44.72]I kind of wish I was right now, actually.
[113:51.17]I need the club here, but I don't have it.
[113:52.75]So we're just going to kill skeletons.
[114:11.61]Damn it, man.
[114:17.08]No, we have a shard on you.
[114:22.24]I'm gonna die.
[114:29.22]I really wish you would come down the stairs.
[114:30.80]Here he comes.
[114:31.26]That fucking lock-on, man.
[114:32.64]It happens to me in the other games, too.
[114:46.30]Mmm, that fucking... DUDE!
[114:47.73]Alright, let's go buy, like, fucking four grass.
[115:06.58]Heal?
[115:06.98]No, don't heal.
[115:10.78]What's the point of equipping a shield if you're not going to use it?
[115:12.50]Well, because, like, so when you... Look, when I block that attack when it first comes in, like, I do, like, 30 damage a swing, and I need to have the... Go get the fucking club, you idiot.
[115:27.13]Dude, just dupe the game is silly.
[115:32.69]Like, are we that much of a consensus that, like, I really need to fucking hack the game to play it?
[115:45.89]Like, are we actually there?
[115:47.07]And we're like, no, no, dude.
[115:48.63]Fucking, the game sucks.
[115:49.77]Just do, hack the fucking game.
[115:52.03]It's not fun.
[116:02.74]For a stream, yeah.
[116:04.12]You know, maybe you're right.
[116:06.88]I gotta get rid of this guy fast.
[116:11.80]Come on down here.
[116:23.57]I almost got shot by that arrow.
[116:24.69]That would have been bad.
[116:25.37]Another one right here, right?
[116:32.25]Is he flying down here yet?
[116:36.33]Don't give in to the cheats.
[116:38.39]This guy's coming down.
[116:39.19]No, what are you doing?
[116:42.01]What are you doing?
[116:42.99]What are you doing?
[116:43.98]Like, what are you doing?
[116:53.88]I can kill this fucking guy now easily.
[117:01.37]I say that and I'm gonna lose.
[117:04.77]Shoot me again.
[117:06.41]Where did you come from?
[117:07.31]What?
[117:07.71]Where did this other guy come from?
[117:08.83]Why is there another one here?
[117:09.59]I thought I got the other guy.
[117:10.39]I thought I got rid of him.
[117:12.00]Woo!
[117:13.14]What?
[117:14.44]Why?
[117:14.68]Where did he come from?
[117:15.40]There were two guys there.
[117:17.36]Oh, shit.
[117:23.79]Whatever, just come back and gra- Like, seriously.
[117:28.59]It's like farming, but faster.
[117:30.07]Just do it.
[117:38.19]Just kill me.
[117:38.73]It's gonna be right here.
[117:39.61]Who cares?
[117:46.77]Just give me my shit.
[117:47.85]Like, and then I'm gonna kill these couple guys and go back and buy shit and go back to 2.
[117:56.86]Secret enemy found.
[118:01.76]I wish you guys would be dropping healing items.
[118:05.02]Like, I really do.
[118:08.61]Just drop me some heals, man.
[118:11.99]If you dupe, I will unsub.
[118:14.31]You see, like, when I hear shit like that, I don't want to dupe.
[118:23.84]If I can get to, like, three or four thousand, I'll be happy.
[118:31.68]Here he comes.
[118:35.72]Oh, that's such a sigh moment.
[118:39.48]And that wasn't a backstep.
[118:40.89]Let's all, like, be like, let's all, like, remember how that wasn't a backstep.
[118:48.45]Fucking god.
[118:49.73]And there's the other guy.
[118:50.59]I don't, like... Just dupe.
[119:07.73]Go ahead.
[119:17.24]No, look.
[119:18.44]The rolling skeletons.
[119:20.10]Aren't these enemies fucking cool?
[119:30.87]Oh my god.
[119:31.51]I'm so done with this.
[119:32.47]I'm so done.
[119:33.19]Just go.
[119:33.63]I'm out of here.
[119:34.05]I'm fucking out of here.
[119:34.63]I'm done with this 4-1.
[119:36.09]Get me the fuck out of this.
[119:40.06]I told you I was fucking out of this shit.
[119:42.24]Fine.
[119:42.66]Just die.
[119:43.18]I don't care.
[119:43.58]I can't hold L1?
[119:49.10]I was.
[119:49.70]And sometimes they don't roll into you.
[119:51.98]Sometimes they just stop and then swing at you.
[119:57.37]Like, I'm holding fucking L1.
[120:00.41]Like, sometimes... See, he just stopped.
[120:01.97]He didn't dive into me.
[120:05.17]And I freak out and I go, I gotta go around him because I'm a fucking idiot.
[120:17.91]My skills have been learned from Bloodborne because I'm a fucking moron.
[120:22.74]And my brain is the size of a fucking squirrel brain.
[120:25.48]That's what happens.
[120:28.42]I play Dark Souls 3 in Bloodborne and I dodge.
[120:35.07]Come on down.
[120:48.95]Finally the truth comes out.
[120:53.01]Come on down.
[120:53.77]Roll all the way down the fucking stairs.
[120:56.27]You dickhead enemy.
[121:03.30]Why did I not block that?
[121:04.82]What?
[121:09.22]Can you parry?
[121:09.66]You can parry?
[121:10.32]I'm not going to even attempt to parry that roll.
[121:15.65]Here he comes.
[121:25.26]This is so terrible.
[121:28.52]Oh, fuck this game.
[121:30.90]I fucking hate this game.
[121:32.76]I fucking hate Demon's Souls.
[121:40.84]Fuck Demon's Souls, man.
[121:46.86]Demon's Souls fucking sucks.
[121:59.36]They took the... It's like this is the worst from both fucking franchises in one game.
[122:09.60]No dupe.
[122:17.64]He even tells his pain.
[122:24.07]If I just beat the first boss... I know!
[122:25.83]If I just beat the first boss, what am I thinking?
[122:38.65]2 game of the year.
[122:40.61]I'm just kidding.
[122:41.35]This game does it.
[122:41.99]Yes, it does.
[122:46.57]Whatever.
[122:50.89]Yeah.
[122:51.75]30 fucking 1.
[122:54.77]I don't care if that was a waste.
[122:56.43]Take them all.
[122:58.23]Let's go.
[123:05.75]Let's go.
[123:10.93]That took my age worth of fucking shit.
[123:12.99]We're beating this.
[123:13.84]I'm beating this game.
[123:14.56]I'm not gonna let this game win.
[123:32.71]Let's go.
[123:37.71]Beat it on stream.
[123:39.76]Now we're gonna do what I did last time.
[123:41.08]We're just gonna fucking beat it.
[123:42.04]We're gonna take our time.
[123:42.90]I have 33 fucking heals.
[123:49.21]This game sucks.
[123:53.67]I'm not gonna have any problems here.
[124:04.72]Fuck these dumb workers.
[124:14.65]I'm not going to get crept up on when the dog comes down eventually.
[124:24.18]Just get the shortcut.
[124:25.64]Fucking beat.
[124:26.32]Get to this.
[124:27.06]We just complete this fucking area.
[124:28.86]I'm going to beat the boss first try.
[124:32.48]Come on.
[124:32.74]Come on, dog.
[124:40.48]Come on.
[124:40.81]Two more dogs.
[124:50.44]Okay, that was dumb.
[124:52.18]That was dumb.
[124:52.70]It's okay.
[124:55.30]I've got plenty of heals.
[125:03.75]Wait, what do you mean?
[125:05.11]What are you talking about?
[125:12.15]I told you I wasn't going to fuck around.
[125:14.71]Once I have confidence enough that I know that I can heal my fucking character...
[125:18.84]Then I can play.
[125:19.44]Then I can take little risks.
[125:29.88]That was a bad risk.
[125:30.78]Because I was... My fingers slipped.
[125:35.18]I'm serious now.
[125:36.02]I'm serious.
[125:37.00]I'm dead serious.
[125:38.76]I've never been more serious about something in my life.
[125:40.39]Except like... I fucking...
[125:48.72]Do your dumb fucking pyromancy thing that takes... I'll... Go.
[125:52.05]Do it.
[125:56.83]Do it again.
[126:01.15]God, I'm just trying to fucking get away from you.
[126:03.98]Watch out for the cat.
[126:04.60]The cat with the pickaxe.
[126:05.44]Don't!
[126:06.30]Thank God I'm not... Thank God I'm... Whatever.
[126:08.30]Just shut up.
[126:08.74]Just, Jeremy, shut up.
[126:13.70]I gotta get to the stupid checkpoint.
[126:15.89]I got some grass.
[126:22.51]Come on.
[126:24.61]Come on, do something.
[126:26.89]I'm right in front of you.
[126:37.69]Get out here.
[126:42.57]Jeremy, shut your mouth.
[126:48.66]Okay.
[126:48.86]It's gonna happen again.
[126:54.05]We got a lizard man.
[126:55.25]We just watch out for the stupid pickaxe guy.
[126:57.17]He's gonna do the dive.
[127:07.59]Don't do that shit.
[127:08.69]Get over here.
[127:14.36]Come on down.
[127:15.40]I'm not playing around right now.
[127:17.32]We're not having a fun time.
[127:19.18]We're not doing a fun game.
[127:24.37]Yeah, come on out here where I can see you.
[127:27.23]I can get a good look at you.
[127:37.78]Zero fun stream.
[127:40.93]Yeah, we're in a zero fun stream right now guys.
[127:53.47]Okay, that didn't block, apparently.
[127:55.65]No block.
[128:01.65]Not fighting a guy in a fucking tiny hallway.
[128:04.42]This level really likes to throw these at you.
[128:10.52]That was a nice spin move.
[128:19.69]Come on.
[128:26.29]Screamer gets booed off the stage.
[128:28.39]I wouldn't be surprised at this point.
[128:32.14]No fun.
[128:34.56]I'm not, I'm, this is, if you, excuse me, if you're having any fun, you're not, no fun.
[128:42.51]Fucking Demon's Souls.
[128:48.39]Like, you know, if they did like a Scholar of the First Sin with this shit... Can you imagine?
[128:52.84]If they did a Scholar of the First Sin... They would have like added a bunch of enemies and made the game worse.
[128:56.96]If they remade it.
[128:57.80]You know what I mean?
[128:58.26]Like, I'm surprised they haven't done that yet.
[128:59.90]Okay.
[129:03.81]Fuck the dumb salamander over there.
[129:06.07]Just go.
[129:12.98]You think Demon's Souls is a game?
[129:18.53]Okay.
[129:19.92]Let me chill here.
[129:20.64]I already got that item.
[129:22.72]Don't need to do that.
[129:25.42]Something going... That's fire.
[129:27.32]I don't want to go in that.
[129:29.09]I will get hurt.
[129:31.53]Take care of these guys.
[129:32.77]They're not that big of a deal.
[129:34.89]Use your shield like fucking Splinter taught you.
[129:49.91]Just like fucking Splinter taught you.
[129:51.43]Don't be overzealous here.
[129:53.49]Easy.
[129:56.45]That was a deep cut.
[129:58.40]That was a deep cut.
[130:14.41]Come here.
[130:21.89]Switch to it.
[130:22.79]It's doing it again.
[130:24.93]It's doing the fucking stutter again, isn't it?
[130:26.81]Better not be.
[130:30.15]I just felt it for a second.
[130:31.73]Apparently not.
[130:32.27]We're good.
[130:40.43]Come on down.
[130:44.30]Well, you're an idiot.
[130:45.58]When you're an idiot, you die.
[130:46.56]I know that for a fact because I'm an idiot.
[130:50.28]Okay.
[130:52.57]We can go left or we can go straight.
[130:53.77]We're gonna go straight here.
[130:58.31]Watch out for the guy with the mallet.
[131:06.16]Look, and all it took was just to have, like, enough healing items to get through the area.
[131:10.56]That's all it took, guys.
[131:11.36]That's all we needed to do.
[131:12.74]That was a- that's a lot of Hearthstone.
[131:17.84]Holy shit.
[131:29.51]Get rid of that.
[131:30.41]A 985.
[131:31.27]It's a sign.
[131:31.75]Everybody's dead.
[131:36.37]Okay.
[131:38.45]We did it.
[131:39.73]We actually did it.
[131:41.83]Unbelievable.
[131:43.95]There's a couple more.
[131:44.63]I added to my collection.
[131:51.06]An unknown hero.
[131:51.84]Solo.
[131:52.12]We're fine.
[131:55.10]Here we go.
[131:56.38]There's the shortcut.
[131:57.69]It's down here.
[131:58.23]Here's the fucking starting area.
[131:59.91]I gotta turn the ship wheel.
[132:02.89]And everything is okay in the world.
[132:04.75]Everything's fine in the world.
[132:06.65]Forget the last hour and ten minutes happened.
[132:10.60]Just pretend it didn't happen.
[132:14.70]Okay, what's that?
[132:16.48]There's something there.
[132:17.14]I'm gonna check that out.
[132:18.54]There's something there too.
[132:20.73]There's like a lot of shit.
[132:21.97]This is a lot of stuff here.
[132:23.99]A lot of areas to go in here.
[132:27.33]Let's take this one at a time.
[132:31.52]What's this?
[132:34.68]Okay, this is just the area.
[132:36.24]Starting place.
[132:38.30]Let's go up a level.
[132:48.11]Uh... Yeah, I ain't doing it on this one.
[132:50.41]Yes, I am.
[132:50.91]No, don't do it.
[132:55.03]Okay, this is where it starts.
[132:57.95]I'm taking so long to do this.
[133:00.75]And dive.
[133:04.29]Shard of Clearstone.
[133:05.24]I don't know what that is.
[133:06.12]Hopefully it's worth having.
[133:08.30]I'm happy again.
[133:10.40]This game's fun.
[133:29.77]Okay.
[133:30.69]Alright, let's go through the fog gate.
[133:35.95]I'm good.
[133:44.91]I fucking forgot about you.
[133:53.47]Go all the way down?
[133:54.25]Hold on.
[133:54.55]I just need to see.
[133:55.27]I didn't get to see what was even over here yet.
[133:56.78]Take off the shield.
[133:58.64]In case that happens again.
[133:59.40]This is why you got a two-hand.
[134:08.37]Against these guys.
[134:09.61]What's the matter?
[134:23.12]Get down that fucking elevator.
[134:24.70]Wait a second.
[134:26.02]I will.
[134:26.58]Just wait a minute.
[134:29.72]I'm currently like locked in this room with the workers.
[134:37.18]Go down, go down.
[134:37.94]Just wait, I'm gonna go down.
[134:39.04]I just need to make sure there's no fucking extra secret weapons here.
[134:45.05]None of you guys, have you guys even played Demon's Souls?
[134:46.71]None of you guys have even played Demon's Souls?
[134:50.01]This game's only available on PS3.
[134:51.47]The percentage of people that actually have played this game has got to be like 19%.
[134:54.09]So, 79% of you don't know where to go.
[135:00.48]And look, looks like you guys are having some fun in this chat.
[135:02.52]Excuse me.
[135:09.96]Large... Okay, that's just a large Titanite shard.
[135:13.94]I'm taking a look.
[135:16.22]Okay.
[135:16.83]I just wanted to see what was in this room.
[135:18.05]I'm gonna go down the elevator.
[135:19.39]Everybody can stop freaking out about it.
[135:26.53]You need to tone down the fun a little bit, guys.
[135:29.88]I noticed very distinctly that some of you guys were having some fun in the chat.
[135:35.37]I don't think so, not in my stream.
[135:43.69]There's the water wheel.
[135:47.81]I am having fun.
[135:48.75]I like this game.
[135:49.26]Look, when I say a game sucks, it's a term of endearment.
[135:53.16]It's me saying... Excellent!
[135:58.44]Just not that, just a little differently.
[136:00.05]When I say like this game fucking sucks, like Demon's Souls sucks, it's me going... Radical!
[136:09.01]I almost just fucking killed this guy.
[136:15.14]Okay.
[136:15.38]Should I get this to +2?
[136:29.03]Crushing Battleaxe?
[136:29.89]Battleaxe?
[136:30.87]What?
[136:31.14]I need two more Greystone.
[136:35.84]I can turn this into a regular Battleaxe?
[136:45.33]So why did everyone... Boss?
[136:55.25]Oh, he's the boss soul person.
[136:56.81]Okay.
[136:57.35]Okay.
[137:04.17]Alright, I came down here.
[137:07.87]Is that what you guys want me to see?
[137:08.95]You want me to see, like, the guy that I am very, very clearly taller than?
[137:12.89]I know, I saw it.
[137:13.47]Somebody already said it.
[137:14.25]Like, look, I know.
[137:15.78]I'm as tall as this guy.
[137:18.32]My character right now is how tall I am.
[137:21.72]Let's say that that guy that's hitting the stuff is like 5'4", right?
[137:24.36]This is how tall my guy is.
[137:26.18]That's how tall I am in real life.
[137:33.15]Renowned hero soul.
[137:35.81]Like, the whole height thing... I've told you this shit before.
[137:40.66]You guys can do way better than that.
[137:42.62]I'm certain of it.
[137:44.78]Like, you guys have been caught up in that shit for like a year and a half.
[137:47.42]There's so much more material to work with with me.
[137:51.11]You know how much more material there is to work with me?
[138:00.42]What do you mean I brought it back up?
[138:02.15]That's like, that's like every stream.
[138:04.93]What are you talking about?
[138:05.95]It's getting to him.
[138:10.29]No, it's not!
[138:11.05]It's not fucking getting to me.
[138:18.09]Now, you just shut up about it.
[138:25.70]If it was getting to me, you'd be able to fucking tell.
[138:28.70]You'd be able to tell it was getting to me, and that's not, okay?
[138:31.52]So stop bringing it up!
[138:39.67]Okay, now I can keep going.
[138:43.59]I smell like garlic every day.
[138:44.67]I might, because I eat a lot of garlic.
[138:48.08]Got a problem with that, guys?
[138:49.26]You guys got a problem with me eating garlic?
[138:54.58]You know, like the healthy thing that keeps me...
[139:13.58]radish rage yeah pretty much I think I was supposed to die there nope well that's annoying we just get to go back up the stairs okay that they pulled that card like twice now we're like
[139:42.57]You don't have anything else up your sleeve?
[139:44.00]You're going to do the drop the fucking wooden bridge on me again?
[139:49.56]Just use range on salamander.
[139:51.98]That would require me to have to think.
[139:54.98]And the crossbow is in the bank anyway, so... Alright, so I can't get that.
[140:05.83]That's sad, I guess.
[140:07.01]That's terrible.
[140:08.35]I would love to have all these things right now.
[140:12.80]I have to, like, probably drop from something.
[140:14.90]I don't know.
[140:16.08]Too bad.
[140:21.34]Oh, well.
[140:24.13]Oh, my.
[140:30.33]What?
[140:32.19]How are you guys doing that?
[140:33.31]You guys can't carry those rocks.
[140:38.18]Do I have to, like, walk over this?
[140:39.66]I don't know if I'm going to be able to do this.
[140:43.56]Do I have to, like, pull them and have them get hit by the rocks?
[140:50.17]Alright, well, that guy just... That guy did exactly what I wanted.
[140:53.27]Alright, come on, throw some more rocks.
[140:55.37]Throw a rock!
[140:57.03]Throw a rock!
[140:59.23]Didn't get him.
[141:08.69]I can take two.
[141:15.10]Dammit, that wasn't a fucking BITCH!
[141:20.17]I love how this fucking guy just literally came out of nowhere.
[141:22.51]This guy just like was turning the co- like how- he wasn't even there.
[141:27.83]Oh, that's so frustrating.
[141:29.07]I hate that shit so much.
[141:31.42]When like, guy that wasn't there just appears behind you.
[141:36.88]Oh my god, eat my fucking ass, Demon's Souls.
[141:43.60]What's the stupid fucking lift?
[141:46.19]It's like over here.
[141:46.77]Where is it?
[141:47.09]Yeah, I could take two, but when I don't know a guy's behind me, and just appears behind me, like every fucking Dark Souls game.
[142:00.30]Guys, this guy's just gonna be behind you.
[142:03.44]Was he there a second ago?
[142:05.04]No.
[142:06.40]He is now.
[142:07.84]Sorry about that.
[142:18.91]I gotta deal with these guys here, too, don't I?
[142:28.05]Like, and... I mean, somebody couldn't have, like, deleted these banisters up top that are causing me all kinds of visual obstructions.
[142:35.25]Now my dog is in here, like, crying.
[142:39.43]Like, look, dog.
[142:40.21]Me, too.
[142:40.67]I'm, like, crying, too.
[142:50.03]Just go.
[142:51.56]He's gonna run through this part anyway.
[142:53.32]Oh my god, I forgot he existed again.
[142:56.48]It happened again.
[143:00.44]What's the matter?
[143:01.72]What's the matter?
[143:04.12]Need to go outside?
[143:04.84]Okay.
[143:05.38]Get off the screen, please.
[143:11.01]It's on there for such a painfully long time.
[143:13.17]Alright, bring it on.
[143:13.97]Throw the rock.
[143:17.66]Oh my god, what a mistake.
[143:19.74]Oh my god.
[143:22.02]Oh god.
[143:24.32]Uh.
[143:25.46]Um.
[143:27.38]Um.
[143:30.51]Made it.
[143:32.29]Great club.
[143:35.87]What else is here?
[143:36.37]Come on, give me.
[143:38.57]I got a great club.
[143:39.41]Are these guys going to kill themselves?
[143:42.42]This is how you do it.
[143:45.70]This is how you get the free fucking souls.
[143:49.36]They're not dead.
[143:49.80]Alright, they're going to continue to do... I'm going to be right back for a second.
[143:55.25]Like, these guys are just going to keep dropping.
[143:56.79]Because, like, this is how I'm going to farm souls here.
[144:01.95]So, just enjoy this while I let my dog out.
[144:04.03]I'll be right back.
[146:38.74]Did I win?
[146:39.90]How are we doing?
[146:41.32]Did anybody else come?
[146:42.25]We're in emote-only mode now.
[146:43.37]What happened?
[146:45.83]What did you guys do?
[146:49.99]What did you guys do?
[146:50.53]Take a look at that club, man.
[146:56.78]That's an A. That is an A scaling.
[146:59.40]And we're putting this on.
[147:00.22]How much do I need?
[147:00.88]20 strength?
[147:01.28]I got that already.
[147:05.68]Oh, baby.
[147:13.71]We got a fucking spiked club.
[147:16.91]Okay, let's go.
[147:20.69]This is the first, like, real strength weapon that I found with A-plus scaling.
[147:26.56]I know it didn't say A-plus.
[147:28.42]I don't care.
[147:31.96]Okay, did I miss anything?
[147:32.96]Thank you, Zook, for the bits.
[147:35.00]Steady Shoe, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[147:37.43]That was from earlier, saying that they were in the same situation after I was in a fucking literal physical meltdown.
[147:43.13]It's gonna happen sometimes on these streams.
[147:45.07]I have a fucking meltdown, I'm sorry.
[147:49.26]This is the R2.
[147:50.68]Overhead smash.
[147:51.48]Takes a lot of stamina, though.
[147:55.72]Wait, no way!
[147:57.24]Wait, did you, what?
[148:00.80]Are these the guys that were coming down the stairs to get me?
[148:03.26]9 damage.
[148:09.20]What am I locked onto?
[148:11.46]Yeah, please lock onto the fucking salamander across the whole level.
[148:14.32]That would be great.
[148:15.02]Doesn't stagger these guys, unfortunately.
[148:22.93]Actually, that does a lot of damage to these guys.
[148:29.31]This thing is slow.
[148:31.39]This is slow.
[148:36.77]What a slow weapon.
[148:39.83]Hopefully this is worth it.
[148:42.17]I gotta be really careful with this thing.
[148:51.44]Well, definitely ain't one-handing this.
[148:54.54]What's the one-
[148:56.05]It's just scattered everywhere now, aren't you?
[149:02.37]Two swings.
[149:02.87]It's like a pulse damage bar.
[149:09.53]Go upgrade the fuck out of it.
[149:11.20]Should I?
[149:12.08]It's too slow.
[149:14.56]It's slow to a fault.
[149:30.19]It's slow to a fault.
[149:35.00]You know, this actually is a good thing because these guys are just now so stuffed in random hallways that I aggroed the whole camp.
[149:44.32]And they're just scattered randomly throughout this whole zone now.
[149:48.46]There's another guy over here.
[149:52.20]Where are they?
[149:52.70]Oh, here he is.
[149:56.58]Swing it faster than, what, by tapping R1, R1, R1?
[150:07.27]I do like the one hit from behind.
[150:10.77]If you miss, you hit yourself.
[150:11.97]That's... No, it's not.
[150:13.01]Is that true?
[150:15.17]Oh, that was a fucking Team Fortress 2 reference.
[150:17.76]Okay, never mind.
[150:22.98]Coming up with the TF2 references.
[150:24.54]I get it.
[150:24.90]I don't know.
[150:26.34]How many people are over here now?
[150:27.74]Still a ton.
[150:36.28]Jesus, man.
[150:37.68]This is... I don't know about this place.
[150:41.29]How am I supposed to get over here reliably?
[150:49.99]Is it to keep pulling people and turning around and running?
[150:52.19]I'm going to assume.
[150:55.05]Give me a break, really.
[150:56.51]I ran into some dust.
[151:01.69]Hit him.
[151:05.52]Whoa.
[151:20.93]What is this?
[151:23.11]Okay, well... There's a way to go this way.
[151:29.99]That's good to know.
[151:33.51]Swing and hit the boulder.
[151:35.09]Like a fucking baseball.
[151:38.40]You know, I would.
[151:39.88]I would try that, but I feel like it would be very detrimental to my health.
[151:44.26]And my health is very important to me.
[151:47.72]There's a way to drop down here.
[151:48.78]Let me see.
[151:51.76]Um... No, that just puts me in a terrible position.
[151:55.27]I can go that way.
[151:56.39]I can go backwards and then across.
[151:58.23]I guess.
[152:02.09]That item over here.
[152:05.39]They're not going to throw shit at me from this way, right?
[152:09.31]No, they're not.
[152:10.69]Should I go in just swinging?
[152:12.27]That's a mistake, right?
[152:13.61]There's nothing over there?
[152:16.06]That's a mistake.
[152:19.86]Steel shield.
[152:22.26]Can I afford holding... I don't think there's a room to go into over there.
[152:25.08]Is there?
[152:25.46]I can't tell.
[152:28.75]We can go up that way.
[152:37.19]These guys with the rocks?
[152:38.51]Who has the rocks?
[152:39.13]It's alright.
[152:46.20]I gotta get used to this moveset.
[152:47.32]It's weird.
[152:48.92]You, like, swing the thing back around.
[152:50.48]Okay, nothing over here, though.
[152:53.80]No, like, illusory walls or anything.
[152:57.44]Put that shield on.
[153:03.18]Steel shield.
[153:05.32]What am I, what am I at for weight?
[153:09.60]Look at this.
[153:10.66]This is a real car door.
[153:11.88]This is what I'm talking about.
[153:12.76]Oh, God damn it.
[153:14.73]I'm fucking fat rolling now.
[153:16.37]Shit.
[153:17.67]What's my weight?
[153:21.59]How do I see my weight right now?
[153:22.85]68 out of 102.
[153:25.59]Is that okay?
[153:26.03]There we go.
[153:31.19]Just have to take the axe off.
[153:36.16]Nothing else here.
[153:39.50]It's nothing.
[153:41.80]Fat rolling fucking loser.
[153:43.28]See?
[153:45.16]Everybody's already on me about this.
[153:48.64]This is just above.
[153:49.46]There we go.
[153:52.66]Like, everyone's already up my ass and I haven't even done anything.
[154:01.21]Wait, wait, wait.
[154:10.31]I can kill these guys in one hit.
[154:11.75]I wouldn't fucking fall like an idiot.
[154:16.18]No, not one hit, apparently.
[154:17.20]There we go.
[154:19.58]You're not dead?
[154:24.48]Do they all fall when one falls?
[154:28.12]They might.
[154:28.49]Of course it doesn't kill them in one hit.
[154:32.27]Give me a break.
[154:33.93]Do they all fucking fall down?
[154:40.81]Does this block?
[154:41.79]Does it block their attack?
[154:42.81]Or is it going to burn the shield?
[154:44.07]Steel gets really hot when it's burnt.
[154:46.94]Yep, doesn't matter.
[154:50.34]I don't want to be holding onto a steel door.
[154:52.24]Especially when it's burning.
[154:54.24]Conducts heat.
[154:55.20]Why do you think it's made out of cooking stone?
[154:57.04]Why do you think stone is made out of steel?
[154:58.59]Why do you think cooking is made out of steel?
[155:10.37]That's it.
[155:11.37]Ah!
[155:22.12]Oh, please.
[155:24.10]Oh my fucking god, he hit me with his fucking turkey neck.
[155:27.16]You know what?
[155:28.08]Fuck you.
[155:31.33]This piece of shit enemy hits me with his fucking long, stretchy turkey neck and I get down to, like, no health.
[155:39.20]Alright, where am I going?
[155:41.18]I have to go this way, don't I?
[155:46.76]What was even up here?
[155:51.12]Cooking is made out of steel.
[155:52.40]Yeah, cookies are made out of steel.
[155:53.56]That's what you guys need to know from this whole thing.
[155:57.14]What's that?
[155:58.80]Dogs.
[155:59.12]Go on.
[156:03.74]Oh man, there's a lot of dogs coming up here.
[156:12.74]Let's play it smart.
[156:14.42]Don't fuck around.
[156:16.48]Who knows how many more dogs could be down here.
[156:23.21]Who knows what other perils lie behind.
[156:24.91]Ed's grindstone.
[156:28.17]Okay, Ed.
[156:32.26]Some shit over here, I think.
[156:38.68]Can I get over there?
[156:40.00]I guess not.
[156:44.24]Thanks a lot, Ed.
[156:46.43]Nothing?
[156:47.17]Nothing.
[156:48.79]Careful.
[156:53.97]Just waiting for something bad to happen.
[157:00.29]It's the same game, Ed.
[157:01.59]It is.
[157:04.43]This is the same game, Ed.
[157:08.25]It's just like 12 years ago.
[157:15.71]We can take care of these guys like this.
[157:19.11]Hit them in the head.
[157:19.67]And then whack them.
[157:22.97]None of you guys have ranged weapons, right?
[157:25.37]Not to worry about that.
[157:28.81]No weapons, no items, no armor, no stuff.
[157:31.08]Okay.
[157:38.04]What does the second R2 do?
[157:39.02]Just overhead twice?
[157:40.30]Okay.
[157:41.48]Good to know.
[157:45.92]I'm going to have some decent amount of souls.
[157:48.66]So I will be happy about this.
[157:51.90]Even a gray club doesn't stagger these guys.
[157:53.54]Why?
[157:56.68]Why is that?
[157:57.72]Why is that, Ed?
[158:03.04]Shards.
[158:04.20]Okay, here's another place to go up.
[158:07.22]I don't think turn...
[158:15.94]Is this, like, water?
[158:16.62]What is this?
[158:17.06]Should I do this, or should I look it down?
[158:20.96]No, don't do that.
[158:22.36]Turn the handle.
[158:24.32]Cutscene?
[158:29.73]Spinning, we're spinning, we're spinning.
[158:30.93]Actually, it was a waterwheel, now that it came up.
[158:37.90]With the amount of blood that's hit this wheel, I'm surprised that this much fucking... The amount of... You know, I fucked it up.
[158:42.30]You know what I was trying to say.
[158:43.02]With the amount of water that's hit that wheel, I'm surprised the blood is still on it.
[158:52.32]Ah, that makes it so I can go down there.
[158:56.35]Fucking cool game.
[158:59.25]That's a pretty... This is a pretty fucking cool game.
[159:02.55]This game's good.
[159:03.09]I like it.
[159:07.97]I'm gonna go back to town, though.
[159:12.53]Because I want to, like, level up once.
[159:16.06]Because I have a lot of shit to... I have a lot of stuff.
[159:21.18]So let me go back to the... I'm gonna go back.
[159:25.04]This isn't... This isn't Rust.
[159:27.24]What?
[159:28.44]Rust.
[159:30.69]I feel like I'm gonna see a boss here, so I'm gonna go back.
[159:32.59]And I'm gonna go back to Rust.
[159:34.29]I'm gonna be a Rust streamer.
[159:39.77]The shortcut is up here, though.
[159:42.33]Wait, is it?
[159:43.29]No.
[159:43.69]I lost my mind.
[159:45.89]I've lost my fucking mind.
[159:48.27]Back this way.
[159:53.10]Let me pick up these items first.
[159:56.12]I'm not going to die here.
[159:57.06]At least I shouldn't.
[159:58.36]Should I upgrade the club?
[160:07.21]Ring of Poison Resistance.
[160:10.03]What's that?
[160:12.79]Just go up here and do like a one swing man thing?
[160:20.88]I gotta upgrade something.
[160:21.78]And you know, that's true.
[160:22.78]I have to.
[160:23.84]As slow as this fucking thing is, I have to do something.
[160:29.86]Not quite yet, though.
[160:31.00]I'm not at the boss yet.
[160:35.62]Looks like I still have a little bit of ways to go.
[160:37.19]Let me just clear it.
[160:39.50]Anything else to grab?
[160:43.95]Maybe... Oh, there's the fog gate.
[160:45.69]He's going to blow this whole place up.
[160:46.85]If I was having framerate issues before... It's like, what do I think is not going to happen now?
[160:55.61]Do it again.
[161:00.24]That's obviously the boss room.
[161:18.15]What about an overhead?
[161:19.90]Lee knocks him down.
[161:20.66]That's so key.
[161:21.44]It's so important to be able to do that shit.
[161:25.48]I can just keep him stun locked.
[161:26.50]Okay.
[161:27.06]Examine his corpse.
[161:30.82]Full moon grass.
[161:31.68]This is definitely the boss, so I'm not doing that right now.
[161:34.50]Let's go level up.
[161:39.48]Just making sure I don't miss something.
[161:53.87]That's not the boss.
[161:55.91]Well, regardless, I'm going to go level up a couple times.
[161:59.62]And upgrade the mall.
[162:10.35]Ouch.
[162:13.61]Not a boss.
[162:14.43]Ha ha.
[162:16.87]Ha ha.
[162:19.88]I can save when it's a boss.
[162:21.22]Yeah, but I need to... I want to just go do this.
[162:24.98]You know, I'm here.
[162:25.64]Plus, if I don't want to lose the souls that I have, even though it's not very many, it doesn't matter.
[162:33.03]Speaking of souls, man, this place sucks big, big, big, big, huge lemons for getting any kind of souls.
[162:45.03]None of these, like, mud, like, lizard people give, like, eight souls a kill.
[162:48.71]It's kind of dumb.
[162:59.19]The camera was up my ass, so I couldn't see where the hell I was.
[163:03.05]That's good.
[163:04.75]Always a good thing.
[163:07.78]They give you stones.
[163:09.94]Yeah, but whatever.
[163:13.12]What do you have for me?
[163:13.86]Do you have anything worth getting?
[163:15.42]You have crescent moon.
[163:16.18]Or pickaxe.
[163:19.58]Okay.
[163:27.91]I thought I wasn't online.
[163:28.77]Why can't I read those messages?
[163:35.98]Go down the blacksmith?
[163:37.62]I mean, yeah, I could, but I want to go level up.
[163:40.80]There's no level up lady down there.
[163:43.28]Unless I'm missing something.
[163:47.24]He's the innkeeper.
[163:48.13]Alright, renowned hero soul.
[163:51.95]This is going to give me, like, what?
[163:52.85]4,000? 1,000?
[163:59.97]Now, the issue that I have... I actually really need to make a decision here.
[164:05.91]Because... Do I really want this slow, slow piece of crap as my weapon that I'm going to upgrade?
[164:15.23]That might be a mistake.
[164:22.35]Who knows.
[164:30.92]The pickaxe is great.
[164:32.20]Maybe.
[164:32.36]Let me just take a look at what I can... Can I level up once?
[164:36.04]Can I level up one time and still have enough?
[164:42.49]Point in vitality or point in strength or something?
[164:44.89]Stones are passed out like candy in this game?
[164:46.81]Okay, well that's cool.
[164:47.81]I'll do it.
[164:48.59]Worst comes to worst.
[165:00.62]It just wasn't worth doing, but that's fine.
[165:02.36]Wait, I can't... I can't upgrade the fucking... I can't upgrade the mall?
[165:12.33]Why?
[165:12.49]Are you kidding me?
[165:14.77]Okay.
[165:23.76]do come how do I need like a special thing I gotta go to the I gotta go downstairs okay well let's put a point in vitality how much does it cost to upgrade weapons like how much is it do upgrade a on my mall because I want to buy some um some food buy a couple of these
[166:00.95]You know, can I buy like, can I still, is it like a thousand?
[166:03.55]Do I need less than that?
[166:04.47]What do I need?
[166:05.95]I guess I could just go back up if I wanted to.
[166:10.17]No interest, eh?
[166:12.09]I can tell you.
[166:16.36]Crescent moon grass sucks.
[166:21.94]I mean, it does, but can I buy half moon from something?
[166:24.94]Half crescent?
[166:30.83]How long am I going to stream this game?
[166:33.47]Until I'm not having any more fun.
[166:39.07]Like, until I'm not having fun anymore is when you'll see this game.
[166:44.12]Okay.
[166:50.24]No, get down there.
[166:50.86]Alright, what can I do?
[166:54.24]I thought I wasn't having fun.
[166:57.02]No, I was.
[167:00.89]Yeah, I still can't upgrade it.
[167:03.15]Well, shit.
[167:05.63]I can't upgrade it.
[167:07.84]It's un-upgradeable.
[167:12.24]I guess I don't have the thing that I need to upgrade.
[167:17.40]I need boss souls.
[167:19.86]Don't I already have... I thought I had a boss soul.
[167:30.14]Okay.
[167:31.76]Alright.
[167:33.16]Whatever.
[167:33.50]I tried.
[167:38.92]So, should I just go buy, like, 20 Crescent Moons?
[167:51.41]Should I just buy a bunch of these?
[167:52.77]I mean, I'm at a boss.
[167:54.26]Should I just buy, like, 15 of these?
[167:57.61]Now, where was the guy that sold the armor?
[168:00.05]I'm getting like a chest piece.
[168:01.05]How much was the chest piece?
[168:01.95]It was back in World 1.
[168:05.08]Where was he?
[168:09.94]I'm gonna buy that plate armor.
[168:14.46]Where the hell was that guy?
[168:19.32]He's somewhere in 1-1.
[168:25.29]Just go in there nude.
[168:30.28]Incoming fat roll?
[168:32.50]No, I'm gonna get rid of all my shit.
[168:37.28]I'll fat roll even if I delete, like, half my character.
[168:46.51]By the gloves?
[168:47.13]Yeah.
[168:47.39]Well, where was he?
[168:48.51]He was somewhere in here.
[168:55.85]Wait, he's not here anymore?
[168:58.39]He moves to 1, 2 after the first... Oh, god damn it.
[169:02.94]Whatever, we're just gonna buy 14 heals.
[169:06.12]And I'm gonna go fight the boss.
[169:09.44]We're just gonna go attempt the boss.
[169:14.56]Just to stop... He moved to 1, 2.
[169:16.30]Oh, well.
[169:20.01]Just go buy, like, a bunch of dog shit.
[169:26.65]Buy 14 of them.
[169:27.69]Don't even care.
[169:31.03]Even if it's a mistake.
[169:36.22]I have plenty of healing.
[169:38.74]I don't want to fucking blow through all this healing.
[169:40.30]I got a new ring too, didn't I?
[169:45.60]Raises poison resistance.
[169:46.62]Well, I'm going to put it on.
[169:53.65]Let's go get it.
[169:54.19]I don't want to use a bunch of healing at the boss because I don't know what it does.
[169:57.11]So I'm going to just attempt to walk around and look at him.
[170:02.59]Hold on.
[170:03.89]I got like some other shit too, like magic damage, right?
[170:10.34]Yeah, stone that radiates guiding light.
[170:12.56]Those are stupid.
[170:15.16]The turpentine is fire paper.
[170:16.86]This is magic shit.
[170:18.04]Sticky white stuff.
[170:21.41]Can I put that on a club?
[170:23.54]I can't put that on a club, can I?
[170:26.56]Whatever.
[170:26.86]Let's just go look at the boss.
[170:38.25]Sticky white.
[170:39.41]Yes, it is sticky white stuff.
[170:42.19]Yes, it is.
[170:42.83]Uh-huh.
[170:46.61]Let's go die to the boss, like, three times so I can figure out what he does.
[170:49.49]Or just beat it first try.
[170:51.29]Enough of this, like, timid bullshit.
[170:54.27]Club's a special weapon.
[170:55.19]Well, let's see how badly we lose.
[170:56.45]I'm willing to give it a shot.
[171:00.34]Are you?
[171:04.40]Time to go beat the boss first try.
[171:10.14]Not a big deal.
[171:12.32]What is this?
[171:12.70]Is this some kind of currency thing?
[171:15.00]Not a big deal.
[171:15.40]You know what I mean?
[171:21.43]Not a big deal at all.
[171:22.17]Hey, what is this?
[171:22.53]I've got a currency thing?
[171:27.28]Get out of the fucking way.
[171:28.28]What is this?
[171:28.76]Oh, it's the poison resistance.
[171:32.46]Here comes a clown.
[171:33.94]I'm going to be in full clown makeup again.
[171:35.72]Oh, I would love that.
[171:39.82]I wish.
[171:41.66]Wait, what am I doing?
[171:47.75]I swear to God, like, if you turn the fucking webcam on and all of a sudden I have clown makeup again.
[171:53.67]No.
[171:54.23]Not this time.
[171:56.21]Not today.
[171:56.89]Maybe one day you'll see it.
[172:02.45]I went the wrong way?
[172:06.75]I did?
[172:08.96]Wait, I did?
[172:11.40]What?
[172:11.54]Wait, wait, wait.
[172:12.24]Did I just, like... What am I doing here?
[172:16.07]What am I doing?
[172:16.91]I went the wrong way.
[172:17.91]How?
[172:18.17]What did I do?
[172:19.67]What about the... Don't fucking die here, please.
[172:23.61]Like, holy shit.
[172:24.23]Like, what's going on here?
[172:25.69]I went the wrong way?
[172:28.61]How did I go the wrong way?
[172:29.99]Fucking dumbass.
[172:34.50]This is what happens, like... See, I told you.
[172:35.80]This is what happens when I go on autopilot.
[172:37.42]I just turn on fucking autopilot and I can't do anything.
[172:41.54]I'm doing the clown fucking joke again.
[172:44.00]And I already, like...
[172:46.80]Let me just get up here, please.
[172:51.78]It's not that I have a bad memory, I just... And what am I getting fucking hit by?
[172:55.18]Are you kidding me?
[172:56.49]Like, are you actually kidding me?
[172:59.31]What the fuck are you doing?
[173:01.47]What?
[173:01.99]In the name of God, I swear to God, I was getting hit underneath the fucking ground.
[173:07.73]Alright, so where am I going here?
[173:09.15]Like, I went the wrong fucking way.
[173:11.53]Where am I going?
[173:13.65]Jesus Christ.
[173:20.51]Down where the fucking gas was.
[173:21.79]Down where the fire was.
[173:22.71]Jesus, man.
[173:23.75]Come on.
[173:32.33]Fucking autopilot.
[173:35.13]My GPS navigation system is just trash.
[173:40.84]Don't ever get fucking ADHD.
[173:42.32]Ever.
[173:42.98]If you get it, fucking go get medicated for it.
[173:44.84]Because it sucks, asshole.
[173:48.76]I say that as I don't have medication.
[173:57.29]I say that as somebody that has it, that does not take any medication for it.
[174:01.07]I don't know why that's so funny to me.
[174:20.44]Alright, here we go.
[174:21.32]Time to fight the boss.
[174:25.12]Incoming boss.
[174:28.71]And I'm going to take a guess here.
[174:31.31]This boss is going to be a giant snake.
[174:34.35]It's going to be a fire snake.
[174:35.79]It's going to be covered in fire.
[174:44.12]Don't do it.
[174:48.90]Keep you stun locked.
[174:52.76]Okay, that was weird.
[174:56.82]Should have been stun-locked by that.
[174:58.10]Alright, good thing I got him.
[175:03.60]Alright, did you drop anything?
[175:06.60]Full moon grass, good.
[175:07.66]Alright, make sure my shit's... Why am I in so much pain?
[175:14.83]It's a giant syringe cloud.
[175:17.69]Okay, let's see what it is.
[175:20.62]We're not at the bottom.
[175:22.08]At least not right now.
[175:23.98]Stone of the eyes.
[175:25.02]Another place to go.
[175:30.80]Okay.
[175:36.92]There's more.
[175:39.04]No, I take that back.
[175:40.12]It's gonna be a spider.
[175:44.16]Take that back.
[175:45.68]It's gonna be a spider.
[175:49.30]What was with that?
[175:49.94]What was with that fucking lock-on bullshit?
[175:51.76]He just, like, spun around in a circle.
[175:53.12]Was this Dark Souls 2?
[175:55.94]Are we playing Demon's Souls or Dark Souls 2?
[175:57.38]I'm not sure which one.
[175:58.62]Are you a hide knight?
[175:59.82]Get out of here.
[176:10.16]Damn.
[176:11.20]We really weren't there.
[176:14.00]What is this?
[176:16.70]I want to go up there.
[176:17.26]Hold on.
[176:17.58]What is...
[176:24.63]I'm so glad this is not the equivalent of, like, an HD night in this game.
[176:27.85]Those things are the most annoying enemies.
[176:34.03]It's just a lift.
[176:35.49]Okay.
[176:35.75]I'm not going to do that yet.
[176:41.03]I want to pick up stuff.
[176:48.74]And it is... A Chris Blade.
[176:54.19]Chris.
[176:58.76]D?
[176:59.24]Really?
[177:00.74]It's a straight sword.
[177:01.50]It's a magic straight sword.
[177:06.24]Huh.
[177:08.54]Okay.
[177:10.18]Interesting.
[177:14.95]So you take more damage.
[177:18.99]You do more damage, but you take magic damage.
[177:21.19]Well, you use it.
[177:22.09]Interesting.
[177:22.61]Whatever.
[177:26.67]Time to turn the, uh, time to turn the old wheel.
[177:30.18]Wait, what's this one do?
[177:33.02]Which one do I do first?
[177:34.14]Okay, it appears to be immobile.
[177:38.80]Let's go.
[177:39.14]It boosts magic?
[177:41.75]Oh.
[177:43.79]Uh... Okay.
[177:46.01]Okay.
[177:53.21]You want to drain a bone.
[177:54.91]Here we go.
[177:55.51]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[177:56.47]Look, look at there.
[177:57.03]There you go.
[177:57.69]There it is.
[177:59.49]Time for the boss.
[178:00.90]Time for boss number two.
[178:02.14]Unless, wait, is there something I can do back here?
[178:04.82]Before I go to the boss?
[178:07.14]Chunk of spider stone.
[178:08.84]I wonder what the boss is going to be.
[178:10.14]Why don't you be like an alligator?
[178:17.95]Nothing?
[178:18.41]There's no, like, no other, like, shortcut or anything I need to know?
[178:22.69]What does this do?
[178:23.58]Alright, let's do it.
[178:27.52]Into the fog.
[178:30.20]SNAKE!
[178:34.50]Let me get in the fucking room first.
[178:36.11]What is this?
[178:36.57]Okay, that doesn't home.
[178:42.57]Okay.
[178:45.05]Oh god, this... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[178:47.23]Alright, see, if you get sprayed... If you get sprayed, you get stuck.
[178:52.26]I'm still fighting.
[178:55.66]How do I get out of this thing?
[179:01.49]Don't get sprayed.
[179:02.29]Alright, that's good.
[179:07.09]Okay, good to know.
[179:09.56]Don't get sprayed.
[179:10.82]What?
[179:11.00]Hit his legs?
[179:14.10]I hit him in the legs.
[179:16.69]Legs seem to be kind of armored.
[179:19.39]What else is going on?
[179:24.75]Interesting.
[179:26.05]What else you got?
[179:26.57]There's like a slash.
[179:32.13]What is he doing?
[179:32.59]What is he doing?
[179:34.51]And I'm like inside.
[179:36.07]Don't touch the webs.
[179:42.22]What is fucking going on?
[179:43.92]What the fuck?
[179:45.86]What the fuck?
[179:47.38]Okay.
[179:49.92]Uh... Well, okay, so that's what that boss does.
[179:57.97]I'm just gonna sprint in this next time.
[180:02.83]So he turns on a blast furnace.
[180:04.73]He shoots sticky stuff, and he's, like, inside of a hallway.
[180:08.54]Oh, you fucking dickhead.
[180:15.53]So, can I block any of that with the shield?
[180:19.63]I wonder.
[180:25.88]Wow, what the hell?
[180:26.64]You didn't block the giant lava from the spider?
[180:28.74]Why?
[180:33.06]I'm gonna try to get in there.
[180:33.90]I'm gonna try to get behind him.
[180:35.14]I wonder if I can do that.
[180:35.94]I don't know.
[180:40.31]Nope, I went the wrong fucking way again.
[180:43.22]Don't get, like, don't, like, get an injection, Jeremy.
[180:45.29]Like, holy shit.
[180:46.17]Are you this stupid?
[180:52.01]You can block every attack with the shield except for the charge attack.
[180:54.67]Really?
[180:55.17]Okay.
[181:06.42]Oh, the only enemy I have to deal with is this guy.
[181:08.32]It's gonna be annoying to have to deal with every time.
[181:10.93]I mean, I can't just run by him.
[181:12.09]Can I run by him?
[181:12.79]Or do I have to wait?
[181:16.67]I have to wait.
[181:20.23]Can I go by him?
[181:22.37]Yes.
[181:22.81]Okay.
[181:24.59]Oh, that was scary.
[181:29.58]Summon me.
[181:30.04]We'll go online.
[181:30.88]No, no, no, no.
[181:37.15]Where did that come from?
[181:45.49]I have to go down the elevator again.
[181:47.31]Oh, that's... I don't like this.
[181:52.70]I don't like the fact that I have to call the lift again.
[181:54.98]I don't like it.
[181:56.38]Alright, so that means we have to win.
[182:06.58]Yeah, I gotta send the elevator back up when I get down here.
[182:13.67]This guy uses shields, but no summonings.
[182:15.85]That's what crosses the line.
[182:17.27]Okay.
[182:35.16]Go back up.
[182:38.58]Let's try it again.
[182:39.30]I mean, I guess you can block this shit, but I can't even see what the hell is firing.
[182:50.17]Don't, okay, don't block those.
[182:51.91]Don't block those.
[182:58.83]Let's get behind him.
[183:01.67]If I can.
[183:02.13]Jesus Christ.
[183:12.14]How close can I get?
[183:12.94]I mean, I guess I can't get behind him.
[183:20.77]So how do I dodge his fucking move?
[183:23.69]His like insane move that he does.
[183:27.39]I guess I can't.
[183:30.36]And I'm like fucking hurting now.
[183:32.66]Okay, what do I do about this?
[183:33.82]What do I do?
[183:34.18]Get behind him?
[183:36.00]Right here?
[183:39.24]Okay, okay, okay, okay, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[183:43.24]I get it. No I don't.
[183:46.24]I guess you can- you can go behind him.
[183:54.24]Run back to the entrance? Do I want to do that?
[184:04.24]I guess I'll run to the entrance.
[184:11.34]But I got behind him there.
[184:15.34]I don't know.
[184:16.89]I'm just going to have to go for it and just dodge and try to go around it.
[184:34.43]Really?
[184:34.93]Oh my god.
[184:35.65]Fuck.
[184:36.49]Really?
[184:36.65]I can't dodge through that.
[184:38.31]Get out of my life.
[184:41.21]So I can't get around that.
[184:42.61]So I just have to run away.
[184:44.58]Okay.
[184:45.64]I guess.
[184:48.42]There's a safe spot behind one of his legs.
[184:50.10]That's what I was figuring too.
[184:51.20]I figured I was like out of the way.
[184:53.12]I guess not.
[184:56.22]Just stand behind one of his legs.
[184:57.54]Okay.
[185:05.63]Come on, blow the room up.
[185:11.27]I can't use the sticky white stuff unless I change weapons, which I might do.
[185:15.21]I might take this off.
[185:17.27]I feel like this is way, way too slow.
[185:24.64]Try to, like, coat my battle axe or something with magic damage and swing at him.
[185:39.71]Let's try it again.
[185:42.29]Welcome to strength builds.
[185:43.41]I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
[185:47.47]Honest to God, I have no idea what the hell I'm doing here.
[185:49.74]I don't know why I was thinking about this.
[185:52.42]In fact, we're going to preemptively take this off.
[185:58.26]I'm going to put the battle axe back on.
[186:02.69]It's just much more opportunity.
[186:04.73]Plus, I can put on the magic damage thing.
[186:09.68]Turn it back up.
[186:11.06]I mean, this might take me another, like, few attempts here, but we'll try.
[186:13.62]It's just... I'm just gonna go right up to him.
[186:29.35]Okay, don't... You can't block that.
[186:31.13]That sucks.
[186:31.73]So you can't block his sticky magic goo shit.
[186:35.97]You'd have to dodge it.
[186:46.41]Okay, so when he does that, I think I can get a hit on him.
[186:50.15]I'm just curious how this works.
[186:51.27]When he puts both his hands down.
[186:54.35]God damn it, I missed it.
[187:03.20]I want to see how far back I need to go.
[187:11.74]I'm so fucked.
[187:16.14]The shield blocks the physical damage.
[187:17.50]Alright, here he goes, here he goes.
[187:18.38]I can't even move.
[187:20.00]How far down do I need to be?
[187:24.36]Okay, not that far.
[187:25.67]Only like that.
[187:26.31]What the fuck?
[187:27.27]What?
[187:28.13]You gotta go all the way back.
[187:29.19]Apparently.
[187:31.25]Okay.
[187:40.20]Alright, just slam down on the ground or something.
[187:51.25]I gotta learn some patterns.
[187:52.33]Can I get him to move?
[187:58.09]That's just another fireball.
[188:10.08]Don't do it.
[188:17.63]And here he goes.
[188:19.23]Get off him and run, please.
[188:26.89]What the fuck, man?
[188:29.03]Like, come on.
[188:29.91]And there he... Dude, that doesn't go that far.
[188:36.07]So what's the attack over here?
[188:39.26]I can't see a fucking goddamn thing.
[188:49.42]I'm so fucked.
[188:50.74]God damn it.
[188:51.48]Alright, I'm not gonna lock onto him.
[189:01.15]If he hits... Those things hit him... That's different.
[189:03.61]Jesus Christ.
[189:06.05]Jesus Christ.
[189:15.32]Alright, come on.
[189:16.86]Alright.
[189:18.14]Where's my... This is going well!
[189:30.16]I did one hit to him.
[189:31.48]I'm doing good.
[189:32.34]Watch out for the fucking explosion.
[189:51.38]Oh!
[189:52.40]Turn around!
[189:53.56]Turn around, you slippery bastard!
[190:01.43]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[190:03.39]Like, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[190:11.15]I can't roll like this.
[190:12.23]Oh!
[190:24.32]I hate this fucking hallway, man.
[190:26.04]Do you have to have that many particle effects in the fucking hall?
[190:32.62]Do you need to do that?
[190:33.54]Fucking lord.
[190:59.81]Fuck it, I'm just gonna get up in his ass.
[191:01.26]Oh, I'm stuck in the web.
[191:08.16]I'm so dead, it's like fucking over.
[191:11.52]It's over!
[191:15.96]No it's not, not quite.
[191:18.96]Time by rolls.
[191:19.88]This is my second real attempt on this boss.
[191:22.90]Come on, give me a break.
[191:23.72]Equip a shield.
[191:27.62]It doesn't really do much.
[191:31.65]It's hard to... That's so fucking annoying, man.
[191:34.61]It really is.
[191:36.13]When he fills the fucking hallway with a particle effect that I can't see.
[191:40.41]Like, fuck!
[191:41.37]That's so horrible!
[191:43.47]I can't, like, when it gets into the camera, I can't fucking see a goddamn thing he's gonna do next.
[191:46.63]Alright, come here.
[191:59.84]Do that move where you shake around and land.
[192:03.46]Alright, that... I got it.
[192:06.69]I got this.
[192:07.31]I got this.
[192:13.90]Do it again.
[192:20.16]Come on.
[192:23.78]Do it again.
[192:30.21]Eat shit.
[192:34.35]Eat shit.
[192:37.01]You gotta be right in the middle.
[192:38.67]Right in the fucking middle.
[192:39.49]Alright, here we go.
[192:40.01]Watch this.
[192:41.39]Jesus, come on.
[192:43.52]No, I'm not playing any fucking funny business right now.
[192:54.69]Come on.
[193:02.01]Give me a fucking break, man.
[193:09.96]Will you please just fucking do a move?
[193:12.56]That's not a fireball.
[193:13.44]And will you please stop taking up my whole screen?
[193:23.49]Do it again.
[193:26.49]Come on.
[193:27.65]Take the sticky shit.
[193:37.25]He's dead.
[193:38.05]One more time.
[193:40.81]Fuck.
[193:44.49]I gotta hit him like two more fucking times.
[193:52.75]Don't cheese me here.
[193:54.03]Don't cheese me!
[194:00.58]I can't fucking see when you do that shit!
[194:07.96]Oh, you fucking little shit.
[194:15.13]Do it.
[194:17.23]Put your fucking face in the ground.
[194:18.33]Now.
[194:21.15]Do it!
[194:23.57]Get fucked.
[194:25.11]Game over.
[194:25.65]Get out of my fucking life.
[194:35.06]That boss was easy.
[194:35.86]I just had to learn how to do it.
[194:36.78]And it took me two tries.
[194:43.63]Look, I fucking ran around in a circle a bunch and I tried to die.
[194:46.85]Look, it's alright.
[194:47.39]Everything's fine.
[194:55.54]The cave sucks.
[194:59.26]We're fine.
[194:59.74]Everything's good.
[195:03.36]You just need to learn the encounter.
[195:04.70]And you can't learn the encounter when you've never done the encounter.
[195:12.95]Holy shit, I can't believe this guy took that long on the boss he's never seen in his life before.
[195:18.83]How dare he not know the entire encounter on his first ever attempt in the game?
[195:23.53]Like, how could you not know that?
[195:25.75]It's unbelievable.
[195:26.57]Uh, hold on.
[195:35.85]Cookie bug?
[195:37.10]No, don't, don't, get the bug.
[195:43.15]What is this?
[195:43.70]No, get over here.
[195:45.00]Oh, you fucker.
[195:45.78]Whatever.
[195:54.27]How dare you not know the entire encounter?
[196:02.77]That's okay.
[196:03.22]Look, if you have a son...
[196:06.59]And your son is like, Dad, I want to ride a bike.
[196:09.27]I want to learn how to ride a bike.
[196:10.21]And you're like, okay, fine, son.
[196:11.40]You're going to learn how to ride this bike.
[196:14.97]I go down to fucking Home Depot.
[196:16.75]I buy him a nice Schwinn.
[196:17.95]I bring it home.
[196:19.89]And I sit him on the bike.
[196:21.41]And he's so excited.
[196:22.37]He's so happy.
[196:23.01]Like, oh yeah, I got my first bike.
[196:25.07]Okay, son.
[196:26.61]Go.
[196:27.63]Do it.
[196:28.83]And he's like, I don't know.
[196:30.44]How do I do it?
[196:31.68]You push on the pedals.
[196:33.36]And he's just like, I don't know.
[196:34.14]And he goes like fucking five miles per hour and crashes because he doesn't know how to ride the bike.
[196:38.62]And then you come over as the dad and go, are you serious?
[196:41.44]How did you not know how to do that, you little shit?
[196:46.46]Get back on that bike and do it again.
[196:50.95]Dad, I didn't know.
[196:52.21]It's my first time on a bike.
[196:53.79]I don't care.
[196:55.09]I've ridden a bike before.
[196:56.55]Have you ever seen me ride a bike?
[196:57.75]I ride a bike real well.
[197:02.43]It's like, Dad, I know you know how to ride a bike, but I've never ridden a bike before.
[197:06.69]What did you just say to me?
[197:12.02]Go to your room.
[197:17.93]Go get a new son.
[197:23.84]I have these two Demon's Souls.
[197:30.44]I've got some more souls.
[197:33.26]Hello.
[197:33.54]I'm gonna go back to my study.
[197:35.68]I hate that fucking kid.
[197:49.10]The lead soul is useless?
[197:53.50]Probably is.
[197:55.32]Uh, I have the... Who's the lady?
[197:59.02]She's so bored.
[198:01.40]It's taken me so long to beat the second boss in this game, the lady's like, the lady's bored.
[198:05.56]Oh, shit.
[198:06.10]I thought you would have done that like two hours ago.
[198:08.00]Let's level up a bit.
[198:12.69]Uh...
[198:17.25]Let's do like... It's called natural selection.
[198:26.54]The ones that can ride a bike live, the others crash.
[198:32.49]You can't like take a test.
[198:34.61]You can't go into... Okay, so you can't go into the first day of American history.
[198:41.08]And the teacher on the first day is like, okay, I'm going to hand out the syllabus.
[198:45.28]And this is what we'll be covering in the class today.
[198:48.06]The test is today.
[198:49.88]Here it is.
[198:50.58]Here's the final.
[198:52.57]You'd be like, what the fuck?
[198:53.53]I didn't even get a chance to know.
[198:54.65]I didn't get a chance to study.
[198:56.43]Too bad.
[198:57.39]Get good.
[198:57.97]Imagine the teacher saying that.
[199:01.55]Get good.
[199:03.19]I gotta learn how to do it.
[199:11.27]I'm gonna buy some stuff.
[199:20.23]Just buy them all.
[199:23.71]Wrecked scrub.
[199:26.56]Oh, we did this.
[199:32.66]I guess I could keep... I could do another one?
[199:35.94]At what point should I go backwards and go back to 1, 2?
[199:38.18]I don't know.
[199:49.66]Time to buy better students.
[199:50.72]Go to the tower.
[199:57.12]The Tower of Latria.
[199:58.42]Uh, should I put back on my club?
[200:10.12]I really need to upgrade a weapon, man.
[200:11.80]Like, it's getting kind of dumb.
[200:17.03]I'm just continuously triggered.
[200:18.87]No, I'm not.
[200:20.29]One, two is easy now.
[200:22.37]One, two, you'd say.
[200:22.91]We'll go back there in a second.
[200:26.74]I'm not like triggered.
[200:29.54]It's just true.
[200:30.66]I don't know what it is about these games.
[200:33.62]You know what?
[200:34.28]The issue is, here's what it is.
[200:36.10]These games have been out for long enough now where everybody's just expected to know everything about them.
[200:41.79]And if you don't, how dare you play them?
[200:45.37]I don't know why.
[200:48.77]Like, how dare you play Demon's Souls without knowing everything about Demon's Souls?
[200:52.41]How dare you?
[200:55.15]I don't know, because I'm playing a game.
[201:02.68]How fucking dare you?
[201:07.60]I was here before and I got scared.
[201:08.82]This place is fucking scary.
[201:23.04]Chairman, where do you get off not knowing this shit?
[201:25.14]I don't know.
[201:32.10]There's the bell lady here.
[201:36.84]These, these, I can't open these, but I can kill these guys with one hit.
[201:40.44]I'll take the souls.
[201:41.46]I'll take the... Okay, never mind.
[201:43.05]Alright, what about you?
[201:45.45]Can't block this.
[201:46.35]I can try to get a kill here.
[201:47.63]What?
[201:49.41]Does the character just talk?
[201:57.63]I guess these guys talk.
[202:00.13]Please.
[202:01.37]Help me.
[202:02.50]I'm not sure.
[202:05.74]Wait.
[202:06.24]What is this?
[202:10.02]Did that guy write a note?
[202:11.42]Is that the guy that wrote the fucking note in this game?
[202:18.63]Huh?
[202:19.67]Prison of Hope West.
[202:21.19]Alright.
[202:23.71]What do you need, man?
[202:28.10]Wizard clothes, wizard catalyst.
[202:29.64]Alright, that's just like a caster outfit.
[202:35.50]Someone's powering up back here.
[202:42.36]Hey.
[202:44.48]Easy.
[202:44.88]I don't think you're the one looking for help.
[202:48.78]Where's the guy looking for help?
[202:55.87]Help me!
[202:58.00]Is that Deckard Cain or what?
[202:59.28]Is that him?
[203:07.42]Why would you give this guy a knife in a fucking deal?
[203:08.94]I don't know.
[203:12.96]Please.
[203:14.51]Help me.
[203:16.11]Help!
[203:18.11]Help!
[203:18.47]It's me, Deckard Cain!
[203:24.61]Back here?
[203:27.10]Can I open this now?
[203:27.90]No.
[203:29.06]It must be up top.
[203:32.04]Oh, please.
[203:33.04]Please help him.
[203:40.69]I'm sure I'll come across this guy eventually.
[203:45.15]Unless I've missed him already.
[203:50.18]No.
[203:51.04]Empty?
[203:55.60]No.
[203:58.35]I hear someone.
[204:02.43]I don't like this place.
[204:06.38]This place is, like, a little weird for me.
[204:14.92]Which, okay, which haunted house are we going in now?
[204:17.49]Is that him?
[204:20.13]Wait, don't kill him.
[204:21.23]No.
[204:28.16]One of these has got to be the right one, right?
[204:32.40]Nobody down there.
[204:33.08]I guess I'm going to keep going and keep opening doors.
[204:39.22]Bad guys?
[204:40.18]Bad guys.
[204:40.58]That could have gone a lot smoothly.
[204:47.01]Could have gone a lot more smoothly.
[204:52.13]Well, now that I'm doing this, at least I know for next time that none of these are worth opening.
[204:56.39]Except for this one.
[205:01.41]Shard of Mercury Stone.
[205:05.47]More smoothier.
[205:06.31]No.
[205:12.43]Okay.
[205:15.22]Let's keep it going.
[205:22.04]There's a fucking Cthulhu monster.
[205:25.90]Get jumpscared!
[205:31.56]These things are so bad Old spice always a good decision.
[205:55.66]Oh
[205:57.58]It's like Terry Crews is gonna like smash open the fucking cell.
[206:01.65]Spray it on my dirty body.
[206:02.93]I'm not the first person that's made this joke.
[206:04.59]I'm sorry.
[206:06.43]Everybody that's picked up that item that you've seen play this game probably said the same thing.
[206:13.70]Old Spice, oh yeah, spray it on me body spray!
[206:17.04]Who hasn't done that?
[206:19.34]Add me to the list.
[206:27.03]I don't hate this zone though.
[206:30.33]I gotta wait for this guy to come around.
[206:32.51]Is his path over here?
[206:39.21]This is a really weird zone though.
[206:42.51]Very narrow.
[206:43.15]I'm just opening every single door.
[206:52.63]This is not going to bode well, eventually, when I do this like a thousand more times.
[207:02.40]Monster?
[207:03.44]Ow!
[207:09.23]I'm almost out.
[207:11.73]Silver Coronet.
[207:19.15]Where are you?
[207:20.17]He's right there.
[207:29.07]They've used the same magic spell move sound effect for the last like two decades That's what that does Another key
[207:57.95]This is just fucking fumble around with keys.
[208:02.58]Oh god, fuck this place.
[208:04.18]I don't want to keep fumbling around with my keys and opening every door.
[208:10.06]Any more of those guys?
[208:14.32]I don't want to open all these.
[208:21.37]I have to though, just in case there's something in them, right?
[208:31.34]Who gave you guys these weapons?
[208:35.59]Same year as Mario 64, that's right.
[208:39.45]Yeah, welcome to the door opening stream.
[208:43.73]I just open every door.
[208:46.89]And pick up some of the items that are on the ground.
[208:48.69]I'm out of healing, by the way.
[208:53.50]I don't think I have any more left.
[208:56.28]Let's see.
[208:59.14]Nope.
[209:01.31]So, it's pretty much game over at this point.
[209:09.18]Huh?
[209:15.32]Did I miss something?
[209:18.59]I can't keep going.
[209:19.45]What about... Is there like an opening to drop down or something?
[209:21.67]I didn't miss anything, did I?
[209:31.96]These doors don't open.
[209:43.46]Oh, what about all the way back down?
[209:44.66]That very first door.
[209:49.90]What about this?
[209:51.27]That's dangerous.
[209:52.57]I don't want anything to do with this.
[210:04.95]Dude, this same level was in Bloodborne.
[210:06.99]This exact same place.
[210:08.11]And you had to do the same thing.
[210:12.51]You had to go all the way around, and then you had to... Who is doing that?
[210:25.43]Well, this game ripped off Bloodborne.
[210:26.75]There you go.
[210:33.19]This level was in Dark Souls... Oh, no, that's what I'm thinking of.
[210:35.07]Dark Souls 3.
[210:37.27]This exact place was in Dark Souls 3, not Bloodborne.
[210:41.05]This was, um... Like, the Karthus, right?
[210:43.80]Like, the Catacombs of Carthus.
[210:45.04]Like, the Karthus dungeon, whatever it was.
[210:48.16]Something like that.
[210:48.84]A little along those lines.
[210:53.82]Oh, man.
[210:54.16]The developers were doing fucking lines when they made this.
[210:56.25]You know what I'm saying?
[210:56.81]Like...
[210:58.48]How fucking much, how many drugs were the devs taking when they made Dark Souls?
[211:01.87]You know what I mean?
[211:02.35]Holy shit, man.
[211:05.45]You know what I mean?
[211:06.27]I want what the devs had when they made this game.
[211:08.15]Fucking, you know what I mean?
[211:08.91]Like, you know what I'm talking about?
[211:10.54]Yeah.
[211:12.20]Haha.
[211:21.75]Anybody standing up?
[211:23.81]You know, if this were Dark Souls, these guys would have stood up.
[211:28.00]Well, it's not that game, is it?
[211:35.69]I want to be careful because I don't want to do this shit again.
[211:37.57]I've got to be careful.
[211:43.71]Camera, please don't fuck me here.
[211:44.91]Oh, okay.
[211:48.67]I thought you killed everybody in one room.
[211:51.62]Locked.
[211:53.56]Well, there's another set of keys to get.
[212:03.34]Prison of Hope West.
[212:04.26]I haven't seen one of those janitors around anywhere.
[212:14.11]Where's the janitor for this level?
[212:16.23]He's like over here.
[212:17.15]Where?
[212:25.25]What is that?
[212:28.02]Somebody is singing.
[212:43.70]What is that?
[212:44.87]What do I hear?
[212:48.07]Where's this last fucking guy?
[212:49.17]Get out of here.
[212:49.85]Where are you?
[212:50.45]What?
[212:50.61]Somebody's... No, somebody... Who's singing in here?
[212:53.43]Somebody's singing in this cell.
[212:59.42]Take the shield out.
[213:00.28]Fuck this.
[213:14.88]How many more people are in here?
[213:20.04]Fresh spice.
[213:22.16]Not old spice this time.
[213:25.41]There's two guys there.
[213:32.45]Synchronize with her, it'll be off.
[213:34.99]Where did he... Where did he go?
[213:37.67]Is he singing?
[213:38.27]That's the one singing.
[213:39.33]Kill him!
[213:39.63]Alright, got him.
[213:42.59]No, he wasn't.
[213:43.31]It looked like he was the one singing.
[213:44.69]This is fucking freaking me out.
[213:50.05]It's not gonna be in sync.
[213:52.24]I'll try.
[213:52.56]Right here.
[214:22.45]Fucking never seen... Why are you in there?
[214:36.54]The voice souls.
[214:42.75]I really don't like this.
[214:44.87]I don't like anything about this.
[214:48.59]I know I'm getting probably close to something.
[214:51.75]But what is it?
[214:53.15]I'm being so timid because I have no healing.
[214:57.47]Fucking choir in there.
[215:02.74]What is that?
[215:03.20]I can't tell.
[215:05.21]There's an Iron Maiden.
[215:06.53]This is going to open.
[215:07.21]There's going to be somebody in here.
[215:08.07]Alright.
[215:13.46]I got armor.
[215:14.80]Finally.
[215:16.08]After like a decade.
[215:26.78]Don't die in human form?
[215:29.50]I know.
[215:30.22]I really shouldn't.
[215:33.71]It's that much further I gotta go, right?
[215:35.57]Just a little bit further.
[215:50.76]Just... Kill him.
[215:55.12]I knew that was gonna happen to one of them.
[215:56.42]Good thing it didn't hit me.
[215:57.30]He, like, got on top of me.
[215:59.32]Oh, fuck!
[216:02.76]Just balls to the wall.
[216:07.88]Dead.
[216:13.68]Key.
[216:15.24]Keys, keys, keys, keys, keys.
[216:17.56]Present of hope, four floor key, four floor cell key.
[216:19.82]Okay.
[216:24.78]Make sure I don't miss anything out here.
[216:26.70]Is there anywhere else to go from here?
[216:30.21]No, I just want to make sure there's no item I didn't get.
[216:31.83]Okay, we're good.
[216:33.11]Everything's okay.
[216:33.84]Do I have any healing items at all?
[216:35.76]Like, zero.
[216:39.94]Hair ornament.
[216:41.62]Telescope.
[216:44.26]No.
[216:47.36]No, no, no, no.
[216:48.60]This is all MP.
[216:53.44]Poison, bleeding.
[216:54.30]No, I have nothing.
[216:58.53]Wait, locked door.
[217:00.91]Wait a minute.
[217:01.23]Wait a minute.
[217:02.59]I think you're right.
[217:06.75]Wait a second.
[217:12.14]Wait a minute.
[217:16.78]Okay.
[217:18.02]Shortcut.
[217:28.01]Huh?
[217:28.33]Huh?
[217:29.49]What is he doing?
[217:30.03]Do a move!
[217:30.39]Do a move!
[217:33.09]Do a move!
[217:34.91]Do a move!
[217:37.26]He's gonna do an angry explode!
[217:39.96]Oh, shit!
[217:40.64]Look at this tiny hallway!
[217:49.24]Oh, God.
[217:50.04]Okay, I'm gonna bait him.
[217:51.06]Here we go.
[217:52.58]Come this way.
[217:56.24]Come on.
[217:56.74]No.
[217:57.16]No.
[217:57.72]No.
[217:58.65]Here we go.
[217:58.87]This is my chance.
[217:59.57]I gotta fucking... I gotta get him.
[218:00.71]I gotta sneak up on him and I gotta fucking smash him.
[218:03.83]That's what has to happen here.
[218:05.47]Right?
[218:05.71]Can I see?
[218:06.31]His back is turned, right?
[218:11.13]Backstab!
[218:13.24]I got him!
[218:16.80]Kill him!
[218:18.22]I'm gonna have to turn you back on me again.
[218:20.92]That was your first mistake.
[218:29.04]Shortcut.
[218:29.92]Give me a shortcut.
[218:30.56]I don't want any more of this MP shit.
[218:33.36]Give me a shortcut.
[218:37.19]Did I get it?
[218:38.33]That's it, right?
[218:41.11]I'm pretty sure this is the first area, I think.
[218:43.59]No, it's not.
[218:44.49]Oh, fuck.
[218:46.27]Oh, fuck.
[218:47.59]Oh, fuck.
[218:48.03]Wait, is it?
[218:49.17]Where am I?
[218:50.37]I need to read the directions.
[218:51.41]I need to read the sign.
[218:56.99]No, not fucking with that yet.
[219:00.41]Somebody's... That's the person that's moaning.
[219:04.47]There's a hole there.
[219:05.64]Open this.
[219:06.66]The person that's singing is in here.
[219:07.60]I don't know who you are.
[219:11.64]Oh, God.
[219:12.52]Talk to me.
[219:12.90]Talk to me.
[219:13.20]Talk to me.
[219:13.50]Talk to me.
[219:13.98]Talk to me.
[219:14.28]Not yet.
[219:14.60]Hold on.
[219:16.84]Hold on.
[219:17.16]Alright.
[219:22.36]What's your story?
[219:24.28]Who are you?
[219:25.25]What are you, from fucking BioShock Infinite?
[219:30.42]Like, what kind of character are you?
[219:31.56]Oh, thank God.
[219:32.16]No, that's too much.
[219:51.87]Full Moongrass?
[219:52.73]That's too much money.
[219:54.79]Buckler.
[219:56.25]I don't want this.
[220:00.82]Ring of... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[220:04.80]Obtain more souls.
[220:08.82]How much is this?
[220:13.06]How much is this item?
[220:14.66]I don't have enough souls.
[220:16.74]How much is it?
[220:19.64]It's 50,000.
[220:23.94]Should I just... Should I take... I think I need it, right?
[220:27.62]I'm gonna have to.
[220:28.14]I have to do it.
[220:32.05]I have to buy one.
[220:34.75]Thanks a lot.
[220:38.43]I need to.
[220:45.29]I need it.
[220:45.77]I have to take it.
[220:49.29]Same tactic as last time.
[220:50.54]Check this out.
[220:56.14]These guys have such jerba fucking Jeremy tunnel vision, it's so easy to get rid of them.
[221:03.17]Back to singing, I see.
[221:04.05]I should probably buy the other one.
[221:08.41]Wait, wait, call... Everybody cool it.
[221:10.73]Cool it.
[221:11.11]Let's go back in the safe room.
[221:16.50]That cut off.
[221:17.96]Oh, he heard me.
[221:22.78]Black leather.
[221:23.36]Put on...
[221:26.89]Gloves.
[221:27.57]Put them on.
[221:29.41]What about... Okay.
[221:30.51]Plate leggings versus... How are the black boots better?
[221:35.49]Oh, they just have poison resistance.
[221:36.64]That's fine.
[221:37.14]What about the helmet?
[221:42.82]This is... Okay, that's just the sorcerer's goofy fucking cat ears from Dark Souls 3.
[221:52.82]Yeah, everything else can stay on.
[221:54.20]I actually have armor.
[221:54.98]Am I fat rolling?
[221:56.34]No.
[221:56.78]Alright, I'm good.
[221:57.58]Let's go.
[222:01.82]Don't go over 50%.
[222:02.86]I'm good.
[222:03.12]Let's open some doors.
[222:07.58]Wow!
[222:11.69]You know... Oh, God.
[222:18.17]Buy the other grass.
[222:22.32]I gotta get to a shortcut.
[222:29.19]Might as well have the other one.
[222:31.77]Okay, let's keep... Not that way, stupid.
[222:39.69]I missed an Iron Maiden at the start of the level.
[222:41.29]Yeah, whatever.
[222:41.83]It's okay.
[222:42.21]I don't got time to fucking lose right now.
[222:45.62]I need to find, like, the shortcut.
[222:47.92]Can't be that much further for the first shortcut here.
[222:50.12]It can't be.
[222:52.55]You know what I mean?
[222:52.99]It can't be.
[223:02.88]Well, the good thing I backstabbed that guy, because I didn't know any of these fucking idiots were even in here.
[223:15.53]There are no shortcuts in this level?
[223:18.15]Huh?
[223:20.65]So how do you get to the boss, like, quickly?
[223:28.16]Stupid streamer doesn't know where the first shortcut is in his first playthrough.
[223:32.78]I know.
[223:33.20]Like, seriously, like, we should just fucking push Jeremy.
[223:36.76]You know what I mean?
[223:38.64]Push him.
[223:40.92]We should just push him.
[223:45.76]You know, the next time I see Jeremy, I'm gonna push him.
[223:49.77]Fuck him.
[224:03.84]Keep the shield out.
[224:07.14]I thought that was a bad guy.
[224:10.39]Who's in here?
[224:11.41]What's in there?
[224:15.19]Can I open you?
[224:16.11]Yes.
[224:25.20]So he goes downstairs.
[224:26.58]Alright, let me open this then.
[224:31.53]That's the cell key.
[224:32.83]Shield out.
[224:38.65]We've got a lot of Iron Maidens in here.
[224:41.00]One of these is going to have a guy in it, or an explosion, so let's take the guess.
[224:48.10]So, I'm going to assume it's the one over here.
[224:49.90]Yeah, it is.
[224:54.79]The one that's all the way in the back.
[224:57.05]Of course it would be this one.
[225:02.39]Another Hero Soul.
[225:03.67]That's good.
[225:08.45]Ring of Magical Sharpness.
[225:09.49]A lot of magic items in this level, huh?
[225:12.50]And that's it.
[225:12.98]Looks like we're just going to keep going.
[225:17.84]Unless... No.
[225:21.82]Okay.
[225:31.53]It's all just... Shield is out the whole time.
[225:34.71]You can call me a wuss.
[225:35.63]You can call me a fucking baby.
[225:37.51]I'm holding L1 until I get to a shortcut.
[225:42.75]Hold Spice.
[225:52.70]Nobody in there?
[225:57.54]Nothing?
[225:59.14]Damn it.
[226:02.36]Strategic.
[226:04.46]There is a little bit of strategy involved here.
[226:08.64]Just a little.
[226:10.06]Not very much.
[226:10.62]I'm very cautious with the... Alright, there's something going on in there.
[226:20.87]This is the guy that was saying help?
[226:25.41]I am Frake.
[226:26.91]I have been trapped here for ages.
[226:29.91]Perhaps you could help me get out of here.
[226:32.97]I am a sage, and I can lend you my power.
[226:36.11]Watch out for the anomaly.
[226:38.63]Oh, take heed of those octopus-headed guards.
[226:41.90]Yeah.
[226:43.42]Oh, okay.
[226:46.06]This door's locked.
[226:46.68]Well, be careful of the guards, is what he says.
[226:50.78]Okay.
[226:51.20]Well, thanks, man.
[226:52.80]Perhaps you could... I am a sage... Oh...
[226:56.16]Hey, watch out for those guards that you've killed, like, 60 of so far.
[226:59.98]Be careful!
[227:00.70]They're dangerous!
[227:04.82]Now what?
[227:11.25]What do I go now?
[227:19.41]I could go down, but, like, that's... That's, like, I'm gonna die if I go down there.
[227:32.38]I missed stairs?
[227:33.32]I did?
[227:36.55]I missed some stairs.
[227:40.13]Huh?
[227:43.55]What?
[227:43.99]Spider on the wall.
[227:47.41]I went right past it.
[227:51.98]I did?
[227:52.32]Hey, you know, when you get on a bike... If you get on a fucking bike...
[228:04.81]This is a... No, guys, I'm sorry.
[228:06.69]This is where you hide the flag when you play World of Warcraft, the lumber mill.
[228:12.71]This is where you hide... This is where, like, on World of Warcraft 1.0, this is the shit that you went as a fucking tiger.
[228:18.57]You turned into a panther as a druid, and you hid here, and no one could touch you, and you'd win the game.
[228:22.84]This is not a staircase.
[228:24.70]Give me a better description.
[228:36.10]Warsong Gulch.
[228:37.16]Exactly.
[228:38.02]The lumber mill.
[228:40.10]Whatever the fuck it was called.
[228:46.07]More keys.
[228:47.83]First floor key.
[228:48.73]Are these open now permanently?
[228:51.19]Like, am I doing myself a favor here?
[228:53.01]I don't know if this is a favor or if this is gonna hurt me.
[228:59.95]This one's locked.
[229:00.53]Is the other one too?
[229:03.86]That was Alteric Valley.
[229:04.78]Yeah, I'm talking about Warsong Gulch.
[229:06.44]Okay, well I can't... I have to go this way.
[229:08.84]They do stay open.
[229:09.64]Well, that's actually... that's good.
[229:12.04]So I'm just doing like a series of shortcuts.
[229:15.10]Kind of.
[229:24.76]Okay.
[229:27.38]Heavy crossbow.
[229:28.20]There's a bad guy over there.
[229:33.39]I don't want him to be facing me.
[229:36.28]Here he comes?
[229:36.96]Yep.
[229:39.74]Just wait till he gets in here.
[229:41.26]Is he gonna walk down the hall?
[229:43.28]No, he's gonna spam this.
[229:50.15]Ow.
[229:51.01]Wow!
[229:51.43]That hurt a lot.
[229:52.43]That was a lot of hurt.
[229:56.85]And now he fucking chases me.
[229:57.99]Really?
[229:58.81]Now you're gonna chase me?
[230:01.40]When he turns the corner, right in the back of the fucking head.
[230:03.78]Just like I was a fucking burglar in his house.
[230:07.42]Three.
[230:08.60]Two.
[230:10.51]One.
[230:14.69]He's turning around.
[230:15.19]This is the strat.
[230:15.75]This is the tactic.
[230:16.33]Remember the tactic.
[230:17.13]Do the tactic.
[230:22.60]Works every time.
[230:33.03]That was fucking fresh.
[230:40.57]Yeah, the classic run and hit.
[230:49.38]Works every time.
[230:53.74]Why is this one not open?
[230:54.72]That seems odd.
[230:58.74]See you later.
[231:00.85]This is a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny hallway.
[231:03.93]Don't get stuck in here fighting somebody.
[231:06.59]You will regret it.
[231:07.39]They're all locked.
[231:18.86]Wait, who's that?
[231:23.36]Well, you are a sane one, aren't you?
[231:28.51]My name is Rydiel.
[231:32.17]Please, liberate me from this cell.
[231:35.48]I have precious little time.
[231:38.82]I must retrieve an article.
[231:44.17]I can't open it.
[231:45.17]I have to get the key.
[231:50.99]Dude, I don't like this place.
[231:52.71]It's just a series of walking around in a circle in a dark area and like opening random doors.
[232:00.84]Now what?
[232:01.62]Ayayay.
[232:07.97]Hit him with the stick.
[232:11.11]What am I supposed to do now?
[232:13.81]No key here.
[232:21.14]Help him.
[232:21.66]I can't.
[232:22.20]I can't help him.
[232:22.76]He's stuck back there for a while.
[232:25.54]Are there stairs?
[232:30.58]Wait a minute.
[232:32.14]I'm so paranoid.
[232:33.10]I can't help it.
[232:33.78]I'm just scared.
[232:34.62]I have one fucking heal.
[232:37.12]No, I don't even have a heal.
[232:38.04]It's gone.
[232:42.73]I'm so scared.
[232:43.99]I don't know the right way to go.
[232:57.81]Go help the other guy.
[233:04.02]Holding L1 the whole time is how I play the game.
[233:10.90]I've opened so many of these, I've lost complete... Hello?
[233:17.40]What the fuck was that?
[233:26.29]Something in here?
[233:27.90]No, it's just an electric chair.
[233:33.94]Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me, excuse me!
[233:36.00]I don't know where it is!
[233:45.12]Ah!
[233:46.18]Get in!
[233:51.13]Mm-hmm.
[233:52.13]Mm!
[233:56.55]I'm gonna get fucking jumped in one of these.
[233:59.55]I know it.
[234:04.18]Wow, hello.
[234:07.70]Stop fucking praying.
[234:09.28]You die already.
[234:12.52]There's nothing in any of these.
[234:20.19]How can you not have one thing in one of these?
[234:26.91]Break it.
[234:27.39]Smash it.
[234:28.22]Illusion.
[234:29.04]No.
[234:32.32]Okay.
[234:32.70]Well, we're down here now.
[234:36.36]Silver bracelets.
[234:42.14]There's more stuff here.
[234:44.44]Ooh.
[234:45.98]Cannot carry.
[234:46.48]It will overburden you.
[234:48.70]What are you talking about?
[234:56.23]How do I...
[235:06.22]How do I throw these gloves on the ground?
[235:11.86]Can I... Can I trash this shit?
[235:15.74]Bat rolling.
[235:16.28]Fuck.
[235:22.47]Oh, no.
[235:23.31]Um...
[235:33.89]Why can I not wear this?
[235:34.67]32 out of 46 item burden.
[235:48.68]105 out of 106.
[235:51.66]Wait, I have to store all this crap?
[235:53.34]Fuck.
[235:58.39]Wizard's clothes.
[235:59.13]I'm... I'm... Just delete it, right?
[236:05.53]Should I get rid of the fucking, like, all this dumb clothing?
[236:11.63]Like the old ragged robes I can throw away.
[236:13.52]Yeah, fuck these things.
[236:19.12]Wizard's clothes.
[236:21.12]Drop them.
[236:27.55]Wizard's gloves.
[236:28.27]I'm not going to use these.
[236:34.78]Old ragged boots.
[236:40.21]This thing... It's just like crisp blade.
[236:48.50]I'm never going to use it.
[236:50.68]Wooden catalyst.
[236:51.46]I'm never going to use this shit.
[236:52.40]And you can't sell anything either.
[236:53.52]So I'm going to get rid of the shields too.
[236:58.39]Drop the seven shotguns.
[237:01.52]Like, soldier's shield, just drop it, I guess.
[237:05.18]I don't think I was going to have to make these decisions.
[237:11.18]How do I know what item I'm picking up? ...
[237:28.40]Helmet on.
[237:32.88]Flute leggings.
[237:37.68]Why do I have ten strange knives?
[237:45.24]I thought that was me.
[237:47.70]I thought that was me making that noise.
[237:49.50]Like, it hurts so much to roll.
[237:56.85]I gotta deposit these stones, too.
[237:58.45]Alright, kite shield versus this shield.
[238:03.79]No, we're gonna keep this.
[238:04.61]Fuck.
[238:18.43]What else do I have that weighs a lot?
[238:19.95]This plate helmet.
[238:20.91]Is the fluid... The fluid helmet's better than the plate helmet, right?
[238:24.74]What about the fucking heavy crossbow?
[238:26.50]Get rid of this.
[238:26.88]It's too heavy.
[238:33.04]It has heavy in the name.
[238:36.62]Alright, how are we doing?
[238:46.25]Fuck.
[238:47.99]Come on.
[238:52.47]My equipment burns.
[238:56.96]Kite shield is larger than the steel shield.
[238:58.84]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[239:00.00]Put the wooden shield down.
[239:08.87]Drop the deck sword?
[239:09.99]Alright, get rid of the crisp blade.
[239:15.45]Sorry, it would be cool maybe one day.
[239:17.08]Get rid of the knuckles.
[239:22.92]Get rid of this catalyst.
[239:32.05]Kite shield, should I, is the steel shield bigger?
[239:35.05]Let me see.
[239:39.43]No, I want the steel shield.
[239:40.47]I'm dropping this fucking kite shield.
[239:42.44]Fuck, wait a minute.
[239:44.72]Which one is the, oh, no, this is the wrong pile.
[239:49.00]God damn it.
[239:54.06]Like, why?
[239:57.03]God, what the fuck?
[240:01.21]Put this over here.
[240:02.16]We're making a new pile over this way.
[240:10.88]Drop this.
[240:11.44]Drop it.
[240:11.90]No, not reorganize.
[240:12.94]Drop it.
[240:13.82]Drop it.
[240:14.70]Drop it.
[240:15.14]I feel like I'm talking to a dog.
[240:27.31]Okay, I'm gonna keep the kite shield.
[240:30.67]Get rid of the crisp blade.
[240:33.91]I gotta keep some of this stuff.
[240:36.89]What about these bolts?
[240:39.16]Get rid of all these.
[240:40.70]Get rid of all of them.
[240:43.42]I'm never gonna do a ranged attack.
[240:44.96]Just drop them all.
[240:50.37]Okay, get rid of the plate helmet.
[240:52.91]No.
[240:54.49]Get rid of the wizard gloves.
[240:57.57]Get rid of the wizard shoes.
[241:06.08]We're okay now.
[241:10.28]What the fuck?
[241:11.12]Why am I still doing that?
[241:13.21]Fluted gauntlets.
[241:17.89]There's something else here.
[241:19.77]Am I picking up from the other... I'm picking up from the shit pile.
[241:26.26]Wait, let me put this back over at the dog shit pile.
[241:28.18]There was one more thing here, I believe.
[241:50.18]Okay, if I knew that this is gonna be a thing, I'm not so sure I would have... Okay, I think I'm alright.
[242:00.96]What else was- there was something else here.
[242:03.02]That's the fucking heavy crossbow.
[242:05.70]Old ragged ro- that's it, alright.
[242:06.98]Just dump it all over here, I got what I needed.
[242:12.18]Heavy crossbow, drop it.
[242:15.89]And there was one more thing I picked up accidentally.
[242:19.29]Old ragged robes.
[242:23.45]Equipment burden is separate to item burden, I know.
[242:28.25]I know.
[242:29.85]Guys, I know.
[242:30.89]I know.
[242:31.41]Oh, I know why.
[242:34.27]I do know.
[242:35.21]But we're gonna have to wait till we get back to town.
[242:43.02]We're just gonna have to wait.
[242:47.32]He's still managing his inventory.
[242:50.42]Not another fucking cool item.
[242:52.86]No, good.
[242:58.29]What is left for me to do down here?
[243:00.41]There must be like one place I can open that I haven't opened yet, right?
[243:06.85]Guys, if you were to pay me ten grand, I wouldn't be able to tell you where the bonfire is right now.
[243:14.71]This has been the same hallway for an hour.
[243:17.24]If you paid me ten thousand dollars, I wouldn't be able to tell you where the fuck I need to go to get to the... to get to the fucking exit.
[243:26.54]Not a single clue.
[243:33.22]Who is that?
[243:33.70]A fat rolling.
[243:37.21]Huh?
[243:37.57]What is it?
[243:37.87]I don't know what it is.
[243:38.47]It's a big fucking... It's a big person ball.
[243:42.71]Die.
[243:43.09]Die.
[243:43.51]Die.
[243:43.95]Die.
[243:44.41]Die.
[243:44.85]Die.
[243:46.81]You fat rolling motherfucker.
[243:54.86]Kill it.
[243:55.48]Kill it with... Kill it.
[244:01.72]Oh my god.
[244:06.42]I just want to... I gotta go back.
[244:08.22]I've opened up so many doors.
[244:09.30]I just want to open up the door that I know I can go to and get back to this area.
[244:16.77]What door is that?
[244:18.33]Where's my shortcut to just come back here?
[244:21.43]Is this it?
[244:23.91]I hope.
[244:24.19]I don't know.
[244:25.47]I've opened so many of these.
[244:30.41]I've opened too many of these doors.
[244:31.83]I don't know which one is the one that I'm gonna go to eventually.
[244:35.61]It's too many doors.
[244:42.64]It's too many.
[244:46.12]It's too many doors.
[244:49.25]Oh god, somebody hold on.
[244:50.21]I gotta like catch up with the bits.
[244:51.69]Hold on.
[244:52.57]Let me go back to town.
[244:53.39]Let me just find the right exit.
[244:59.04]I just got 50 bucks.
[244:59.92]I got a lot more bits as well I gotta look at.
[245:03.13]I've been super, super tunnel visioned this whole time.
[245:06.47]I just don't want to die.
[245:07.73]I'm out of healing.
[245:11.81]I missed the cookie bug, I know.
[245:14.62]At this point, it's just survival.
[245:20.70]And that's how you drop down and die.
[245:23.22]Good thing I was paying attention.
[245:30.91]There's no shortcut of that kind.
[245:32.07]Yeah, but what about the one that, like, you open up to and the boss is, like, right there?
[245:34.53]You know what I mean?
[245:37.28]There's gotta be one where you open the door and the boss is, like, there and you just, like, an easy run.
[245:41.80]What is this?
[245:46.48]Oh, no.
[245:50.02]What is this?
[245:50.86]Is this the boss?
[245:52.12]Did I run into the boss area?
[245:55.60]What is that?
[245:56.52]I don't know if I want to go here.
[246:00.70]What door is this?
[246:11.68]This is like a secret, but I'm not confident right now.
[246:17.95]Where was that thing?
[246:25.73]Alright, but where... Where's the bonfire?
[246:31.41]I'm gonna go over here first.
[246:33.15]I feel like there's something I need to open.
[246:34.57]Because let's get down to here, right?
[246:42.84]I'm not prepared for that.
[246:47.12]Here we go.
[246:47.50]Right here.
[246:48.56]This is locked.
[246:49.38]Fuck.
[246:52.81]Really?
[246:55.79]Shit.
[247:05.36]This is the shortcut?
[247:06.16]Where's the key to get this shortcut?
[247:12.70]Where's the key to open that?
[247:13.86]It's gotta be around here somewhere, right?
[247:34.16]Too bad I dropped the rope bow.
[247:38.44]It is too bad.
[247:39.08]It's too bad I'm lost.
[247:41.02]In this nightmare.
[247:44.26]Ugh.
[247:52.97]He's not reading chat?
[247:54.39]I kinda can't right now.
[247:56.55]I have half HP, no health, and I don't know where I am.
[247:59.89]And I hear all kinds of noises.
[248:01.01]I can't, like, read chat right now.
[248:10.98]This is not where I wanna go.
[248:18.06]Gotta be something I missed.
[248:19.44]I hear a guy over here.
[248:22.37]Where's this fucking ring-a-ding-ding?
[248:26.71]Pay attention to me.
[248:27.77]See, I read.
[248:36.22]Fuck.
[248:39.40]Ah.
[248:42.72]What is this?
[248:45.88]What is this?
[248:46.22]Have I been in here?
[248:46.82]I haven't been here yet.
[248:48.70]Where am I?
[248:49.20]What is this?
[248:50.87]This is like a different way to go.
[248:52.77]What is going on here?
[248:53.51]There's the big guy.
[248:54.29]Big scary guy.
[248:57.37]Uh.
[249:00.51]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[249:06.82]Shard of Moonlight Stone.
[249:17.55]Don't do it.
[249:18.15]Don't go back.
[249:18.93]Don't do it.
[249:21.13]Use the crossbow?
[249:21.91]I threw the crossbow on the ground.
[249:23.41]That shit don't exist anymore.
[249:25.85]This is a mistake.
[249:47.69]Alright.
[249:47.95]I just want to get back to where I was.
[249:51.47]I'm back.
[250:25.11]Hey, look, a shortcut.
[250:27.99]Alright, I think I need a break.
[250:30.57]Yeah, I think I'm gonna need a break here.
[250:37.63]I'm gonna deposit all this shit and see if I can do anything.
[250:49.52]Yeah, I will get to the bits.
[250:50.82]Let me deposit all these.
[250:52.20]Deposit all of them.
[250:54.77]I don't need to hang on to these.
[250:55.85]Look at all this stuff.
[251:05.17]I can't believe this counts as items.
[251:10.87]Yeah, I'll read the bits.
[251:11.93]Don't worry.
[251:13.29]I ain't gonna leave without doing that.
[251:16.80]Put the mail breaker away.
[251:20.15]Kite shield away.
[251:21.01]Put this away.
[251:23.71]Put this away.
[251:26.27]Put this away.
[251:27.13]What am I wearing?
[251:35.03]A helmet.
[251:36.75]That's alright.
[251:37.33]Okay.
[251:37.97]I should have enough room now.
[251:40.95]I need to figure out how much am I going to get for using these.
[251:49.65]I should be able to do... I think I'll get one level out of this.
[251:57.62]Oh yeah, I will.
[251:58.44]Oh yeah, I'll get like a couple.
[252:02.78]Fat roll?
[252:03.24]I know, I gotta get rid of this fat roll dog shit.
[252:08.31]I like this game.
[252:09.81]Having a good time.
[252:10.55]It's a good game.
[252:15.61]No, forget about the Jeremy from like fucking an hour and ten minutes ago.
[252:20.09]That's not me.
[252:21.13]This is a different one.
[252:21.73]This is a different Jeremy.
[252:31.14]I deleted those items?
[252:33.04]Huh?
[252:33.70]Oh, I didn't.
[252:46.14]What happened to Jeremy from an hour and ten minutes ago?
[252:47.75]He went on a break.
[252:49.87]He went, like, BRB to go upstairs.
[252:52.31]I was just waiting for him.
[252:54.47]And I fucking piano-wired him.
[252:56.83]Because, like, how dare you say that shit about Demon's Souls?
[253:00.90]I piano-wired his neck.
[253:04.88]I was next in succession anyways, so it doesn't matter.

[254:34.34]He ain't coming back.
[254:36.14]But, Tara, thanks for the bits.
[254:39.41]Jeremy, Stockpile Thomas deletes your items over a certain limit until you complete his quest.

[256:03.85]Thanks for the $5.
[256:04.37]You've been giving me valuable giggles for a while now.
[256:07.63]I appreciate everything you do.
[256:08.46]Thanks.
[256:08.74]Well, thank you for the $5.
[256:12.48]I thought this was a cranking stream.
[256:14.60]God.
[256:17.00]Thank you.
[256:17.32]I'm just casual for the $5.
[256:18.95]Furious Wiki.
[256:20.59]Furious Kiwi.
[256:21.43]Thanks for the bits.
[256:23.03]You just say p-p-p-power.
[256:25.78]Scythe, Scythen, thanks for the bits.
[256:27.48]For some reason I heard you were a substitute teacher.
[256:29.40]Is that true?
[256:30.62]Do you have any advice for a teacher, a substitute teacher in general?
[256:34.25]I was a substitute teacher for like a year or two.
[256:41.86]Um, just kind of do what you're told.
[256:44.02]You know?
[256:44.38]Like, if you're trying to be a teacher, then you tell the students what to do.
[256:48.15]But if you're a sub, you can't really do your own thing.
[256:52.17]Follow the lesson plan.
[256:52.95]You know what I'm saying?
[256:55.25]But, thank you.
[256:56.31]Scythen for the bits.
[256:58.83]Uh, RogueSniper, thanks for the bits.
[257:01.60]Thank you.
[257:01.94]Also, GoodBurger, again, two more times for three or four dollars here.
[257:06.20]Thank you.
[257:06.50]You died, you died.
[257:07.14]You just said I died every time I died.
[257:08.70]Thanks, man.
[257:11.10]Uh, 77 Firelight, thanks for the bits.
[257:12.52]More bits till my first badge.
[257:13.78]Well, thank you.
[257:15.26]I'll talk to, I'll talk to him, don't worry.
[257:17.40]Tara, again, thank you for the $1.
[257:19.02]Jerm, I've, I've subbed for 11 months, one month away from a full year.
[257:23.04]Your filthy easy mode baby shield tactics are so gross that I can't support you any longer.
[257:30.55]Well, fuck.
[257:33.83]Yoshi Dog, thanks for the bits.
[257:35.29]Cheer 100, thanks man.

[257:45.89]Super stoked.
[257:46.53]Good luck.
[257:47.61]Wish you the best.
[257:51.73]Sticks Renegade gave $5 a while back.
[257:53.44]Time for a rant movie.
[257:57.48]No.
[257:58.94]Phil White.
[257:59.44]Thanks for the bits.
[258:04.00]I think I'm all caught up there.
[258:07.14]Anyways, guys, I will see you on Sunday.
[258:10.92]I've got stuff going on this weekend, so I will not be around.
[258:13.54]Like I said, I'm having fun in Demon's Souls.
[258:17.24]It's good.
[258:18.68]Like I said, don't listen to me when I say that I think a game is dumb.
[258:21.98]It's bullshit, and I'm a fucking idiot.
[258:25.04]I just get frustrated.
[258:27.48]It's like somebody tied a fucking rope around my nuts and pulled me on the other side.
[258:31.34]You know what I mean?
[258:31.78]It's like, oh!
[258:33.04]It hurts.
[258:35.88]Let's talk to him.
[258:38.53]before the stream ends.
[258:39.33]Tuck.
[258:43.55]But you said don't listen to you when you say the game is good.
[258:49.25]Don't ever listen to me.
[258:59.80]That candle maiden cared for me.
[259:02.32]She says very little, but has a kind heart.
[259:05.86]When's the next dream?
[259:06.50]Sunday.
[259:06.90]Sunday night.
[259:08.58]The poor, poor girl.
[259:10.98]If only something could be done.
[259:14.44]If only something.
[259:16.82]You have a heart of gold.
[259:19.66]What?
[259:22.25]As for me, I'm only here to tend to the flames.
[259:24.57]What does he want me to do?
[259:25.19]I keep the candles lit.
[259:28.15]I keep the candles lit.
[259:30.68]Why did you guys want me to talk to him?
[259:37.20]That hairpin.
[259:38.34]That belongs to my daughter.
[259:39.60]Then she didn't make it.
[259:43.93]May I ask you a favor?
[259:45.57]Favor?
[259:46.37]Would you mind giving up that hairpin?
[259:50.41]Give the jade hairpin.
[259:51.53]Yes.
[259:52.97]You're a saint.
[259:55.01]Thank you.
[259:56.29]Thank you so much.
[259:57.73]Oh, I mustn't forget.
[259:59.35]It's not much, but please accept this as thanks.
[260:02.98]I'm a bit ashamed to say, but I found it one day, discarded on the main road.
[260:07.04]I'm supposed to say no?
[260:07.84]Huh?
[260:09.76]But it seems to possess a strange power.
[260:12.34]What am I supposed to say?
[260:13.05]I'm supposed to say no.
[260:14.35]Anyway, I feel that you should have it.
[260:16.35]I was supposed... I wasn't supposed to say no?
[260:17.91]In your...
[260:19.82]Ring of Herculean strength.
[260:22.84]What?
[260:23.92]That thing's fucking awesome.
[260:25.08]Why would I not want this?
[260:30.48]Look at this.
[260:31.20]This is exactly what I wanted.
[260:35.22]What are you guys talking about?
[260:36.22]Kill him now?
[260:37.10]No.
[260:40.56]I got the ending now.
[260:43.48]The good ending.
[260:44.18]Fine.
[260:44.52]I'm gonna rear up and fucking kill everybody in here.
[260:48.14]And just like the other games, they just come back when you fucking load the game up again.
[260:51.51]So who cares, right?
[260:53.23]Who's gonna die first?
[260:57.93]How about... How about you?
[261:00.97]Level up, lady.
[261:03.55]Alright, I'm gonna baseball swing this lady and hit her across the room.
[261:08.90]No, it would be no.
[261:11.10]Don't... Oh god, no.
[261:12.00]Don't do it.
[261:14.12]Kill them all.
[261:14.68]Don't... They don't... They stay dead forever.
[261:21.03]Okay.
[261:21.57]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[261:22.89]Good night.
[261:24.53]I could have just ruined everything.
[261:26.09]I was going to do it too.
[261:31.35]That's all.
[261:31.77]That's all she wrote, everybody.
[261:37.38]Good night.
[261:37.76]Thanks for watching.
[261:38.54]I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[261:40.14]Take care.
[262:13.46]you
