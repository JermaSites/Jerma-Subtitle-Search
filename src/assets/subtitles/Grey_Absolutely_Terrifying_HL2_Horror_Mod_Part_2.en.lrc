[00:08.59]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:10.43]Jerma here with some more Gray, the Half-Life 2 horror mod.
[00:15.80]This is part two.
[00:16.54]Welcome to part two.
[00:17.70]If you missed part one, I'll make sure to put an annotation on the screen and a link in the description if you missed it.
[00:23.46]So let's just keep going here.
[00:28.49]Ooh.
[00:32.39]Pipe.
[00:32.65]There's a pipe on the ground over there.
[00:34.67]Can I pick it up?
[00:39.18]Oh, first weapon of the game.
[00:42.57]Physics engine.
[00:43.49]Alright, let's break.
[00:44.31]Actually, you know what?
[00:44.87]I'm going to make sure there's nothing over here.
[00:46.21]I don't want to miss anything.
[00:48.95]Yeah.
[00:50.05]Where's my light?
[00:50.63]There it is.
[00:52.95]Oh, what about in here?
[00:54.75]The lock is jammed.
[00:56.87]Just like everything in this game, every door is locked.
[01:01.08]Get out of my way.
[01:01.78]Phew.
[01:04.24]Alright.
[01:04.82]Alright.
[01:07.30]What we got?
[01:09.12]We got any monsters?
[01:12.77]Doesn't work, apparently.
[01:13.99]Let's go this way, this way.
[01:16.85]Toolbox.
[01:18.53]Don't care for the toolbox.
[01:19.81]Do not cross!
[01:22.59]Don't cross what?
[01:25.04]Oh, what?
[01:27.78]What if I just smash it?
[01:30.02]Oh, okay.
[01:32.48]We should have said, do not smash me.
[01:40.32]Oh, God, what is this thing?
[01:44.06]Oh!
[01:44.60]Hello, lady?
[01:47.38]I don't want you to get me!
[01:49.36]That thing's gonna stand up.
[01:50.34]Look at this thing's eyes, man.
[01:53.13]Oh, it's gonna stand up and it's gonna stop running at me.
[01:55.67]Run.
[01:58.61]Ah, that thing I know for... Ah!
[02:02.37]Ah!
[02:09.72]Seriously, seriously, no.
[02:12.70]This is not, this is... Whatever, let's just, can I... Oh, damn.
[02:24.43]Can I, please get me out of this sewer.
[02:26.07]Get me out of this sewer.
[02:26.91]This is the worst part of playing in a game like this.
[02:30.21]I just don't know where I'm going.
[02:31.09]I'm so scared.
[02:31.61]I don't want to get eaten by this guy.
[02:33.61]This door, nothing's opening over here.
[02:41.18]He's not over here now.
[02:42.64]He's not over here now.
[02:44.96]He was sitting on this.
[02:48.50]Where do I go now?
[02:52.67]Okay, at least I'm out of that.
[02:55.49]Nonsense.
[02:57.71]Can I break into that?
[02:58.75]No.
[02:59.79]Open this door, open that door.
[03:01.35]What do you got in here for me?
[03:03.81]Anything?
[03:04.39]No, you don't have anything for me.
[03:09.14]Exit!
[03:11.09]Good.
[03:12.49]Found the exit.
[03:14.25]It only took me.
[03:15.89]I close the building for the working hours.
[03:18.15]I don't want strangers walking around.
[03:19.89]If you want to leave for something, the key is on the top of my locker.
[03:24.00]The caretaker.
[03:27.52]Alright.
[03:28.34]Where's this guy's locker?
[03:30.90]Where's his dirty gym shorts?
[03:32.74]It's definitely somewhere in here.
[03:39.30]No, not that way.
[03:40.30]Boxes, break them.
[03:43.59]Can't get in there.
[03:45.63]Where's this guy's locker?
[03:47.69]Oh yeah, just like, go find my locker in this deserted, desolate place.
[03:52.01]Thanks a lot, buddy.
[03:55.92]That's just like, trash.
[03:59.38]Whoa.
[04:00.56]Alright, I'm cool with breaking all that.
[04:04.86]So I gotta go back into here.
[04:06.20]I'm gonna find this guy's locker.
[04:10.62]Oh, great.
[04:15.26]Just a couple of vents.
[04:18.90]This little place here.
[04:23.14]Cool.
[04:25.91]Make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.
[04:28.11]That's my motto.
[04:29.89]Another one of these.
[04:36.91]No locker, though.
[04:37.79]At least not in here.
[04:49.45]Can't open that door.
[04:52.18]Maintenance!
[04:54.16]Is this the guy's locker?
[04:55.44]Yeah!
[04:56.16]I found your key!
[04:58.54]Found the key, man.
[05:00.12]Let's go back across.
[05:09.09]Cool.
[05:13.32]Is there anywhere else I can go over here?
[05:15.00]No.
[05:15.88]Doesn't look like it.
[05:20.64]Alright.
[05:21.38]I've got your key.
[05:23.85]Forget where that freaking door was, though.
[05:26.09]It was over here.
[05:28.41]And straight ahead.
[05:31.15]Right here.
[05:31.85]The exit.
[05:33.05]I got the key.
[05:34.77]Don't need to read your note.
[05:35.97]Let's just go right out the door.
[05:36.98]Mm-hmm.
[05:41.90]Alright, let's keep rolling here.
[05:45.84]Let's go up the stairs.
[05:49.38]Leon's Furniture.
[05:50.54]Alright.
[05:55.17]Whoa.
[05:57.99]Um... Excuse me, uh, mister.
[06:01.27]I think I'm gonna have to club you to death in your face.
[06:05.47]Because, uh, if you're... He's not here.
[06:08.51]Okay, good.
[06:09.03]Good.
[06:10.06]Good.
[06:12.06]He's probably going to be right here, though, so I'm probably going to have to punch him in his face.
[06:16.08]With my club.
[06:17.52]My lead pipe.
[06:20.68]Let's go.
[06:23.35]Can't open this door.
[06:27.99]Anything?
[06:29.53]Really?
[06:30.05]Alright.
[06:30.29]This guy's sure got a lot to say.
[06:31.87]Going through...
[06:45.78]Ooh, more pills.
[06:46.82]I don't even know what those things even do.
[06:49.22]What do those things do?
[06:50.22]Oh, orange juice.
[06:52.04]There's a body good.
[06:55.47]Can I move this?
[06:56.67]Get out of the way.
[06:57.65]I want to get in there.
[07:01.01]Nope, door's locked.
[07:03.93]And this door's locked too.
[07:05.87]How does that make any sense?
[07:08.93]Oh, what?
[07:10.87]Oh, this door was locked and this door was locked.
[07:12.51]Now the other one.
[07:13.07]No!
[07:24.79]Great.
[07:26.23]Great.
[07:28.15]That just scared me.
[07:29.56]This painting of this dude just scared me.
[07:32.98]Can I go out here?
[07:34.76]I can't.
[07:35.14]Okay.
[07:39.76]Down the hall we go.
[07:44.57]Trash bags, trash barrels.
[07:46.70]Let's get in here.
[07:47.44]Whoa!
[07:51.52]What the hell is going on?
[07:55.22]What the hell is going on?
[08:00.42]Why can't I go in here?
[08:02.40]What the hell is going on?
[08:06.03]Can I not?
[08:07.91]Ugh, that's like freaking me out.
[08:08.93]I gotta get... Ugh!
[08:12.03]Ugh!
[08:13.89]What is happening right now?
[08:16.12]What is happening right now?
[08:25.10]Why didn't you... Oh god!
[08:37.01]Come on!
[08:38.41]Get me out of here.
[08:41.95]That was weird.
[08:48.51]He's in here?
[08:54.11]There it is.
[08:56.49]Come home, honey.
[08:57.35]We have to talk about this.
[09:00.85]I've got a gun now.
[09:01.87]This is my mother's handwriting.
[09:04.13]It's my mother's handwriting.
[09:06.05]It couldn't be her.
[09:08.36]I don't have a choice, though.
[09:10.32]I have to follow it.
[09:11.82]Alright.
[09:12.62]I've got a gun.
[09:13.16]This has been acting up for the last two weeks.
[09:17.15]Can I smash the fuse box?
[09:19.95]Break it!
[09:21.07]It's got no use.
[09:22.13]I got no use for it now.
[09:23.09]Okay.
[09:31.41]This door opens to go down the stairs.
[09:35.90]Fuse box!
[09:37.00]Is this the fuse box I can break or something?
[09:39.28]Okay, danger.
[09:41.68]240 volts.
[09:42.42]I just did it.
[09:43.14]Good, good, good, good, good.
[09:45.36]Hey!
[09:45.56]Hey!
[09:49.59]Ah!
[09:50.23]My god!
[09:51.11]My god!
[09:53.21]Oh my god!
[09:55.42]Oh my... There's somebody else here!
[10:03.20]Whoa my god!
[10:07.64]Wow!
[10:10.12]Wow!
[10:13.62]I can still hear something!
[10:14.80]I only have two bullets.
[10:19.55]Are you absolutely kidding me?
[10:22.97]The game... The game... Okay, can I just... I gotta say this right now.
[10:28.95]This game has been, uh... Sort of slow.
[10:32.14]And it's been, you know, do some tasks.
[10:34.38]Do this and that.
[10:35.86]I come up here.
[10:36.56]Oh, there's something weird going on with this... This fuse box.
[10:40.70]Go touch the fuse box.
[10:42.56]That was one of the most ridiculous things ever right there.
[10:45.79]Like, I seriously almost died from that.
[10:50.25]Wow.
[10:52.29]That was just so unexpected.
[10:53.49]I did not think that was gonna happen.
[10:55.45]Holy crap.
[11:00.61]Now where do I go?
[11:02.33]That means there's probably more.
[11:03.44]That's gonna happen again.
[11:04.56]Oh, I don't have any bullets.
[11:14.34]No, no, no.
[11:16.08]This is so cramped.
[11:18.07]Ah!
[11:19.42]My god, is he attacking?
[11:20.54]He's attacking me!
[11:21.34]Dude, this game just got so horrible!
[11:25.78]This game just got so bad!
[11:28.04]This game just got so scary!
[11:32.57]Oh no!
[11:35.47]Oh no!
[11:39.77]Wait, do I have?
[11:40.55]No, that's Tuesday.
[11:43.89]No!
[11:45.33]This... This is so fucked up.
[11:50.38]I agree.
[11:50.90]No!
[11:57.10]Damn!
[12:01.55]Those guys with the knives!
[12:03.23]It is so horrible!
[12:05.61]Oh my god, guys.
[12:11.83]Guys, seriously.
[12:15.05]Seriously?
[12:17.43]What's that?
[12:21.41]This noise that's in my head right now.
[12:23.09]This like... I'm so on edge right now.
[12:29.05]It's not even funny.
[12:34.24]Some guy's gonna... God.
[12:38.58]Those enemies...
[12:47.90]Oh my god, this is the scariest game I've ever played in my life!
[12:59.49]You haven't seen a scarce Saturday like this in a while.
[13:03.99]I haven't been this freaking out at a game.
[13:07.02]I don't got any bullets left.
[13:09.08]Hallelujah!
[13:19.53]my god oh my god what's that noise oh my god what the hell is this little thing get out of here man I don't even know where I am or where I'm going I have no idea where I'm going where I am what's even happening I don't have a clue I've just been wandering around aimlessly
[13:50.62]So, yeah, highly recommend you go download Gray if you want to scare the poop out of your pants.
[13:58.18]Takes a little while to get there.
[14:00.70]But it is here, and it is here in full force.
[14:05.31]Is that a spider?
[14:06.07]What the hell was that?
[14:06.81]There's a spider on me right now!
[14:07.99]Oh my god!
[14:13.01]Did you see?
[14:13.61]Could you?
[14:13.91]I want to see if you can see that in the camera.
[14:15.89]I think a spider just landed on my shoulder.
[14:25.14]Really?
[14:26.16]Really?
[14:26.50]You're gonna throw... I'm in this game right now, you're gonna throw that at me too?
[14:33.11]Insane.
[14:35.07]Absolutely insane.
[14:38.15]I don't even know where... I don't know where I'm going, guys.
[14:40.31]I have no idea.
[14:40.85]I need to get out of here.
[14:41.65]Once I get out of here, I'm ending this episode, because I... I seriously... I need to, like, go take, like, a bath.
[14:47.73]I need to go take, like, five showers, because I just, like, need to clean the scare off of me.
[14:54.43]Well, that's gonna wrap it up here, guys, for Scarce Saturdays.
[14:57.04]Uh, part three will be coming next week.
[14:59.32]Thank you so much for watching.
[15:00.36]I really do appreciate it.
[15:02.24]This last, like, two or three minutes was some of the most ridiculous two or three minutes ever.
[15:07.91]So, uh, thank you so much for watching, everybody.
[15:10.61]I'll see y'all soon.
[15:11.57]And of course, take care, everybody.
