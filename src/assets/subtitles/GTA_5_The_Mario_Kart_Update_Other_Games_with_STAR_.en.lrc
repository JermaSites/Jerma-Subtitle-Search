[ve:60.16.100]

[00:11.53]I wish my phone would turn on.
[00:14.51]I was in the middle of a text with somebody.
[00:26.92]Oh, Mystery Games.
[00:28.78]It's gotta be TF2.
[00:37.05]I'm sorry, guys.
[00:38.01]I didn't even do anything on my stream.
[00:39.54]I didn't even start.
[00:40.98]I didn't get the right thing correct.
[00:43.70]You didn't even download the games.
[00:45.58]It's going to be another hour.
[00:47.82]Oh, yeah.
[00:49.46]4 p.m.
[00:50.00]We're just kind of chilling.
[00:52.02]Why don't we just get this really started at 4 p.m.?
[00:56.45]I'm going to have to yell some people's names.
[00:59.97]Sorry, I'll be back.
[01:03.38]Hey, what's going on?
[01:04.24]Cevix, thank you for nine months in a row.
[01:06.32]And Cevix didn't even show up on the stream.
[01:07.92]It's because I'm a bad streamer.
[01:10.58]And I don't have the overlay here.
[01:11.86]But Cevix, thanks, dude.
[01:13.16]Welcome back for nine months straight.
[01:16.33]Beer.
[01:17.43]Oh, there's a beer.
[01:18.69]Sick.
[01:23.43]Me and Star are going to play Necropolis.
[01:26.31]And then we're going to play a mystery game.
[01:29.13]We're just going to chill for a little bit though, guys.
[01:31.03]We're not playing anything yet.
[01:32.43]Star is still doing his thing.
[01:39.63]I want to add this.
[01:45.69]Copy.
[01:46.35]Can I copy this?
[01:48.83]Not really.
[01:49.26]We're just going to chill for a little bit.
[01:53.04]You can still look at the Necropolis screen for like 10 minutes or so.
[02:00.09]Wait, what?
[02:01.79]Hey, it's the Germmeister.
[02:03.16]Hey, what's going on, Gray?
[02:04.16]Gray007, thanks for five months, dude.
[02:07.56]Jerm is streaming at an actual reasonable time.
[02:09.68]I know, it's weird, isn't it?
[02:11.82]Can my fucking phone turn on?
[02:15.10]I was mid-text, and the thing just doesn't even want to turn on now.
[02:18.84]It just wants to stay turned off.
[02:22.02]Please.
[02:25.38]Well...
[02:28.26]You still go to the gym or is it 2012 all over again?
[02:32.26]Nice to go.
[02:34.33]Wait, what?
[02:37.39]Zuma, this is not supposed to be a scary game.
[02:39.31]Unless I don't think it is.
[02:42.35]But welcome back, dude.
[02:43.13]Thank you for your two months in a row.
[02:46.13]Which reminds me, I need to get my Twitch alerts thing to open.
[02:49.47]I wasn't prepared to stream at all.
[02:51.23]I thought we were going at 4.
[02:52.37]You know, I wanted to go at 4 o'clock.
[02:54.51]And that's what we're doing.
[02:56.28]We're just going to go at 4.
[02:58.82]See, Star doesn't know.
[03:00.76]He tried to talk me down to like 2.
[03:03.04]I'm like, we're doing it at fucking 4 o'clock, buddy.
[03:05.40]You know what I mean?
[03:06.18]I called him buddy, too.
[03:07.06]It was really condescending and really pissed him off.
[03:12.98]Oh, wait.
[03:13.72]Oh, oh.
[03:15.68]Thank you, ItGoff.
[03:17.36]Three months.
[03:18.04]Oh, wait.
[03:18.70]What?
[03:19.20]Oh, boy.
[03:19.82]A new subscriber.
[03:21.22]A new one.
[03:24.99]Hold on one sec.
[03:30.81]Oh, we got a double sub here.
[03:32.05]Hold on, Star.
[03:36.25]I have a double sub.
[03:38.33]Hold on, Star.
[03:38.91]Double sub.
[03:39.49]Don't you know what that means?
[03:41.10]Oh, double sup.
[03:42.12]Double sup.
[03:42.54]Double, double, double sup.
[03:44.34]Thank you, both of you guys.
[03:46.00]Yeah, ready?
[03:47.54]Double sup.
[03:48.76]Double sup.
[03:50.24]Here's something.
[03:53.48]They don't do that anymore.
[03:57.28]They don't do that anymore.
[03:58.42]Name me a place you've been to where a bunch of people crowd around and do like, happy birthday, happy birthday.
[04:03.46]They don't do it anymore.
[04:04.14]It's embarrassing, so they stop doing it.
[04:06.14]It's become enough of a joke that everyone knows.
[04:12.65]It's become enough of a joke.
[04:14.77]No service.
[04:15.47]How come I don't have fucking service?
[04:19.00]God damn.
[04:20.02]Wait, what?
[04:22.80]I'm annoyed.
[04:23.52]I heard this game has like two hours worth of content.
[04:26.00]Well, you're in for a fucking two hours then.
[04:30.57]Captain Spooky, thank you.
[04:31.31]Three months.
[04:31.89]Welcome back.
[04:32.47]I want to sleep for myself.
[04:34.09]He smokes a lot of weed.
[04:37.05]Thanks, dude.
[04:37.39]Welcome back.
[04:37.73]If Jerma will ever... I'm in the menu.
[04:40.23]How do we, like... Hold on.
[04:41.81]I wasn't ready to, like... I told you I wasn't ready to stream.
[04:43.89]I got my shit going.
[04:44.95]Hold on.
[04:46.25]Well, number one, you have to actually go online on Steam.
[04:49.15]I know that's asking a little bit much from you.
[04:51.82]Wait, what did you say?
[04:53.98]Asking me what?
[04:55.48]It's asking a lot for you to come online on Steam.
[04:59.52]Shut the fuck up.
[05:00.66]When was the last time you were online on Steam?
[05:04.70]Oh, God.
[05:05.18]It's been a long time.
[05:08.18]It's probably been, like, a month.
[05:09.82]Maybe a full month.
[05:10.64]Wait, what?
[05:16.42]See, like, I just caught him online.
[05:17.58]Somebody's already messaged me.
[05:20.16]It's me inviting you to a game.
[05:22.21]I know.
[05:22.63]That was the joke.
[05:24.23]I'm glad you got it.
[05:26.73]No one else got it.
[05:28.57]You and I did.
[05:29.11]I'm explaining.
[05:30.35]Okay.
[05:31.31]I should just text on stream.
[05:33.35]I'll give an update.
[05:34.05]I have a situation update, guys, from the Wolf Blitzer situation room.
[05:39.12]I know what the situation is.
[05:40.38]We'll talk about that some other, maybe a little bit later so we don't invade on Star's stream.
[05:45.65]Last Jerma stream, he was checking a lot of Tinder.
[05:48.51]He is pleased to announce that he has been issued a court order for sexual assault.
[05:55.91]Jesus, easy.
[05:59.03]Don't spoil it.
[06:00.45]No, I gotta, I gotta, I gotta fucking, where are you?
[06:04.82]What is your name?
[06:06.28]Sheduff.
[06:09.03]Alright.
[06:09.97]Yeah, how do I... I invited you.
[06:11.89]Thanks a lot, Abbot J. Welcome back for four months.
[06:14.57]I will be texting on this stream.
[06:16.51]You better believe it.
[06:19.01]I don't know... Okay.
[06:20.75]I just took it.
[06:23.25]Are you with me?
[06:24.33]I don't know.
[06:26.01]It says there's available slots for friends.
[06:28.81]It says... Hold on.
[06:30.15]I gotta restart the game.
[06:31.13]It says I'm offline.
[06:31.95]I'm going to the bathroom then.
[06:35.17]It's a bathroom.
[06:35.77]Go take a piss.
[06:37.07]Go get it out of your system.
[06:38.17]Fuck.
[06:39.76]Go get it out of your system.
[06:44.24]E, offline.
[06:45.78]Network connection.
[06:46.50]Okay, well, let me try this.
[06:49.23]This is gonna leave and come back.
[06:54.03]Look, go get it out of your system, okay?
[06:59.66]I'm gonna play this for a little bit.
[07:00.52]I don't know how much fun this game is, though, guys.
[07:02.44]I have no idea.
[07:04.36]Across both of our streams, I'm not sure if this is gonna be good, bad.
[07:08.38]I've heard very, very, very, very, very good and very bad things about this game.
[07:13.16]So, mm-hmm.
[07:14.90]Okay, it actually works now.
[07:16.28]Just need to wait for his invite.
[07:19.68]In the meantime, I'm going to make a Twitter tweet that says, Yo!
[07:23.32]What's up, bros?
[07:24.38]Streaming!
[07:25.78]Come hang!

[07:41.21]Regular Nintendo.

[07:44.87]That hurts.
[07:52.77]Save the buddy stream for you guys.

[10:05.88]Okay, hold on.
[10:07.27]I accidentally ate my thingy.
[10:09.87]Oh, dude.
[10:10.47]Because it's Dark Souls buttons.
[10:12.43]And X is not attack.
[10:14.33]Really?
[10:14.61]Whoa, we can hurt each other.
[10:16.81]Yeah, there is team damage.
[10:18.15]Oh, that's great to know.
[10:19.25]Fantastic.
[10:19.89]Okay, so is this just Dark Souls, but not Dark Souls?
[10:22.89]Is that what you're trying to tell me?
[10:23.80]No, this is a shitty indie game that makes you think it's Dark Souls, but is actually in almost no way similar.
[10:30.10]Oh, okay.
[10:31.38]Well, let's go.
[10:31.90]Okay.
[10:33.83]Oh, look at the buttons!
[10:35.61]Let me see, let me see how to, like, what buttons I need to be pressing here.
[10:38.59]Okay, live in a glass house, don't throw stones.
[10:40.19]If you live in a glass house, if you live in a glass house, if you live in a glass house, I got it.
[10:44.81]Okay, and if you live in a glass house, if you're living in a glass house... Yo, Polo Juice, thanks for four months, welcome back, dude.
[10:51.63]Hey, I think we're supposed to go this way, the ancient Aztec Wind Waker sign is there.
[10:57.01]Oh yeah, the ancient Aztec Wind Waker sign, let's go.
[11:01.88]This game's very dark.
[11:02.94]I'm gonna turn up my brightness.
[11:04.14]I think okay.
[11:05.00]Yeah, just wait another like 30 minutes for Jerma to be ready Watch out dude fucking stuff living in the glass house.
[11:12.02]You got enemies to fight nice work I'm like scared to even go near you because we can hurt each other
[11:22.43]Yeah, take turns.
[11:23.17]Alright, there's a sword.
[11:24.57]Okay, and if you live in a glass house... God damn it!
[11:28.57]How is everything you say is, like, this catchy?
[11:32.24]What?
[11:34.40]Will you interact with the giant crystal?
[11:39.56]Oh.
[11:40.42]Uh... I'm interacting.
[11:44.94]Save the game.
[11:45.64]Save your game, dude.
[11:46.28]I think only one of us has to do that.
[11:49.16]The animation is so slow.
[11:50.29]The animations in this game don't look like they are the same.
[11:53.23]Okay, well, I... You might be dead.
[11:57.59]No, I, like, tested what holding right clicked it, and I went down the well.
[12:03.81]So... Am I supposed to jump down?
[12:05.91]If I were you, I'd come down the well.
[12:08.86]There's a giant... Okay, there's a giant Illuminati.
[12:12.70]Oh, interact.
[12:14.20]Quick, interact with the Illuminati.
[12:16.06]Confirm.
[12:16.44]Go down the... Stop!
[12:19.52]I don't think we should do it.
[12:20.12]No, don't do that.
[12:24.55]It was an elevator drama.
[12:26.19]Interacting is an elevator drama.
[12:27.61]Okay, but we fell down the first well.
[12:29.19]I thought it was the second well.
[12:30.79]Let's go.
[12:31.83]Fucking throw stones.
[12:38.07]Oh, there is a run with you pushing left stick.
[12:41.85]Okay.
[12:43.13]Cool.
[12:43.27]Okay, we're learning.
[12:44.35]We're new to this.
[12:44.99]Okay, so when you're pushing the left stick, you do the, I'm an anime character running at my enemy about to attack.
[12:50.08]Yeah.
[12:53.30]How do you hold the shield up?
[12:55.38]Left bumper?
[12:56.44]Okay, you push in the right stick, too.
[13:00.72]Yeah.
[13:01.60]Oh, hold on.
[13:02.20]I gotta actually do something.
[13:04.29]Oh, you're gonna wait for Star.
[13:05.69]Oh, I think Star's not ready.
[13:06.73]Oh, thanks.
[13:07.43]Lucario subbed to me.
[13:08.99]He's a Smash character.
[13:10.78]Come on, man.
[13:12.66]Gotta wait for Star.
[13:13.72]He's not ready to start a stream.
[13:14.84]Can we go?
[13:18.04]Watch out.
[13:18.74]Watch out.
[13:18.98]There's fucking Power Rangers over here.
[13:22.61]There's the yellow one.
[13:23.87]Hey, you gotta do the start your animation trick.
[13:26.45]Watch out.
[13:26.97]Oh, wait.
[13:27.25]Watch out for Tyrion.
[13:30.01]Uh-oh, fucking Tyrion Fordrick.
[13:32.59]They don't care about that.
[13:34.85]These laser beams guys care that I exist.
[13:36.66]Nobody else does.
[13:39.96]He just hit me.
[13:43.50]I'm trying to act like an excited streamer.
[13:47.06]I got the crystal sword.
[13:47.86]Well, I got the buckler.
[13:54.88]Alright, let's keep going.
[13:56.39]You got a shield bash.
[13:57.21]I don't think that's the same thing as a parry, but I heard it's good.
[13:59.63]So it's not a parry.
[14:01.77]So if I try to parry this guy... It's a parry.
[14:05.46]Wait, no.
[14:06.30]Are you sure you didn't just bash him and it looked like a parry?
[14:09.84]Yeah, no, he fell backwards.
[14:12.15]Yeah, I know, but I don't... It's not a parry, it's a back.
[14:15.87]Yeah.
[14:16.33]I don't know.
[14:17.53]You're wrong.
[14:18.11]They fall down, though.
[14:20.17]They don't fall... If I bash this guy right now, he's not gonna fall down.
[14:25.65]Bash him.
[14:26.27]Yes.
[14:28.17]Watch out for the fucking faces of evil.
[14:31.98]I don't know why I'm taking damage trying to prove to you that you're dense.
[14:35.02]How do I eat the food?
[14:39.94]Axe.
[14:41.92]We're going to die in the first 10 seconds.
[14:43.90]There's no reason for us to be going this fast and this quick, man.
[14:48.36]A lot of enemies in this game.
[14:50.02]I didn't know you stanced until that long.
[14:51.82]Holy shit, that's very long to swing.
[15:02.91]Jerma the ass eater.
[15:04.57]Look at this.
[15:05.23]Jerma taking out three enemies at once while Star runs away from one.
[15:08.39]Oh, Star's dead.
[15:11.26]Yeah.
[15:12.46]Where's the revive button?
[15:13.28]I can, like, press E and tap E on you.
[15:15.55]You really can.
[15:19.57]You actually can do that.
[15:21.55]Okay.
[15:23.45]No jokes?
[15:25.45]Yeah, but that was a joke.
[15:28.83]Don't tell the world no more jokes.
[15:31.79]Alright, well, now that we have a second, let me tweet that I'm streaming.
[15:35.67]Oh, my God.
[15:37.79]Yeah, you gotta wait for me, dude.
[15:39.85]Just retweet my tweet.
[15:41.39]No, because people are going to be like, oh, he's just a star follower.
[15:48.07]I'm never streaming with you again.
[15:54.65]This Star Wars character, by the way, keeps talking.
[16:03.19]It doesn't feel like you're in a cantina in Star Wars.
[16:11.57]I made you, Alfred.
[16:40.55]Alright, so, let's, no more jokes, no, thank you.
[16:43.99]Let's, uh, stop, no more messing around, let's actually play.
[16:47.52]You did fucking, you didn't do 1, 2, 3.
[16:50.78]It goes the second you step on it.
[16:52.10]I'm gonna tell you, you're gonna have to 1, 2, 3 with this because it goes instantly.
[17:03.03]Oh fuck, holy shit, you are so close to being off.
[17:07.63]Okay.
[17:08.98]Is there, like, a pole?
[17:10.62]Is there a... grab?
[17:13.92]No.
[17:15.00]Are we doing a kill while NPCs run?
[17:17.86]Kill?
[17:19.60]Man, these cost money.
[17:20.66]I don't even have any gems.
[17:25.10]Let me interact.
[17:28.73]Yeah, okay.
[17:29.37]Ster is exhausting himself.
[17:31.01]I am not doing anything.
[17:35.46]Word on the town is the game is easier if you play with the second person, unless it's Jerma.
[17:41.42]We just started.
[17:42.18]We're just having fun.
[17:43.16]Look, I beat Dark Souls 3 on stream, okay?
[17:46.96]I'm now part of the lucky few.
[17:49.26]The lucky ones that did that.
[17:53.61]I beat the game on stream.
[17:54.93]Yeah, that makes me part of the selective group of people that did that.
[17:59.61]So you can talk all the shit you want.
[18:03.09]The selective people.
[18:04.27]Jerm is one of the selective people.
[18:06.41]Did you beat him first try?
[18:08.83]No.
[18:09.43]I'm just going to kind of be annoying to these guys while you do your thing.
[18:15.56]Doing my thing.
[18:21.26]Okay, I'm starting to get it.
[18:22.32]You don't have any air attacks?
[18:24.28]No, you don't.
[18:26.85]Doesn't appear that you do.
[18:30.09]Yeah, you do.
[18:32.59]Yeah.
[18:33.53]R1.
[18:35.91]Jump in R1.
[18:36.43]Eat food to make your stamina bar full again?
[18:38.67]I need food badly.
[18:42.25]Oh, because I've been standing around waiting for Jermina.
[18:45.22]Jermina.
[18:46.08]Stamina Jermina.
[18:47.74]Listen to me, son!
[18:49.64]I'm your dad!
[18:50.38]Destroy him!
[18:52.64]Destroy him!
[18:57.33]Marshall8642.
[18:58.65]Thank you, dude.
[18:59.40]Welcome to the stream.
[19:00.78]Welcome to the channel.
[19:03.74]Thank you for your subscription.
[19:05.22]Hope you enjoy your stay.
[19:13.18]I'll get the spider.
[19:14.87]Watch out for the balls.
[19:17.81]Watch out for the ball.
[19:19.33]Watch out for the moon spiders.
[19:20.21]Do you have anything with this money?
[19:22.43]Are these the gems you were talking about?
[19:24.01]Yeah.
[19:26.62]You should give it all to me.
[19:29.16]I can't say I'm completely happy that you have to actually walk over to pick it up.
[19:32.57]I can't say I'm completely happy with how zoomed in this camera feels.
[19:36.43]If there's a way to pull it back, let me know.
[19:38.71]Especially when the bottom of my screen says how many things I need to collect, I feel claustrophobic.
[19:44.43]it does oh yeah okay yeah it just keeps doing that and it makes it feel like I have I'm like too close oh yeah yeah now that you said that you just totally I was alright until you said that yeah now now you're realizing that it's terrible remember to collect the creature droppings okay you stop picking up the droppings and come help me fight the three bearded men
[20:12.84]That guy lost his clothes.
[20:13.76]That guy turned into one of the things that they turn into in The Little Mermaid.
[20:19.55]You know when they don't have their powers and they're like the little slug people?
[20:22.09]That guy just looked like one.
[20:30.80]And tough nuts.
[20:32.02]That guy was easy.
[20:32.44]Thanks Tommy.
[20:32.98]Tough nuts.
[20:33.32]I need food badly because I've been waiting for Jarmo.
[20:39.01]Why did you have to say that?
[20:39.97]That's the only thing I can see.
[20:41.57]There has to be a way to turn that off.
[20:43.25]It's awful.
[20:47.58]Don't do it.
[20:48.50]Have you learned anything about games like this?
[20:50.30]You can't just look at the menu.
[21:02.49]Good plan.
[21:03.33]Nice kill.
[21:04.79]I'll collect creature droppings.
[21:08.00]I'm already despising when you walk near an item and it has to tell you like a giant pop-up I'm being agitated This is like a privacy button in this game it says privacy open Does that mean like somebody can just look at me go to the bathroom?
[21:28.31]Everyone asking how the game is we've played it for three minutes
[21:38.97]Where did these guys come from?
[21:41.39]I think they spawned in a corner, which I hear is a thing that happens.
[21:45.41]So this game has left-for-dead mechanics?
[21:48.07]Is this an AI director?
[21:50.16]Because if you kill the boomer, then they show up.
[21:59.98]Ow.
[22:01.62]This weapon's really slow.
[22:03.16]I'm not a fan.
[22:06.46]I, uh...
[22:09.28]Forgetting what the actual shield hold-up button is.
[22:12.30]It's L1.
[22:12.76]Oh, that's... Hey, good.
[22:17.47]I did a nice show of swordsmanship for that guy.
[22:21.83]Lion starting.
[22:23.47]They sound like angry elephants.
[22:24.47]Can I...
[22:28.16]They're fighting each other.
[22:29.28]Can I go do, like, a die here and you pick me up and I understand?
[22:32.41]They just spawned on top of me.
[22:34.53]Is that what you wanted to do?
[22:35.77]You wanted to kill them?
[22:37.39]Let me die to one of these.
[22:38.85]And you can pick me up and we'll see, like, how that works.
[22:42.83]They just keep spawning here.
[22:44.01]I'm gonna get zapped.
[22:49.18]I'm not gonna get zapped.
[22:50.56]I don't like that weapon.
[22:53.04]Holy shit, they really are just spawning.
[22:56.58]Or just tap it, or just hit it once?
[22:58.08]How much health do you have?
[23:00.62]Okay, yeah, that gives me some, like, free health and stamina.
[23:05.46]That's pretty good.
[23:05.96]Where are they coming from?
[23:07.86]From behind.
[23:11.82]You gotta collect the dinosaur droppings.
[23:16.95]Oh, shit, I'm sorry, I hit you right in the back.
[23:18.63]You hit me way more bad than I hit you.
[23:20.39]No, shut up!
[23:21.75]Fuck, there's one more gem over here!
[23:23.25]One more jewel!
[23:29.19]I don't know.
[23:30.55]I'm kind of almost at the point already where I just want to play the next game.
[23:35.22]Really?
[23:36.76]Yeah.
[23:39.20]Wow, really?
[23:39.98]You didn't even give it a chance.
[23:45.90]Look it, you did.
[23:51.25]Game kind of sucked.
[23:52.69]Let me eat my giant turkey leg.
[23:55.89]Wait, what?
[24:00.88]I was giving it the benefit of the doubt.
[24:02.28]Am I muted right now?
[24:03.96]No.
[24:04.29]Okay.
[24:04.73]I want to be.
[24:05.23]I want to be.
[24:07.09]Beemouse.
[24:08.07]Beemouse, thank you for five months.
[24:09.31]Welcome back, dude.
[24:11.29]Appreciate your five-monther.
[24:13.83]We're going to keep gaming, though.
[24:14.97]Game on.
[24:15.29]Excuse me.
[24:16.95]Game on.
[24:17.41]That's my chest.
[24:18.19]That's my chest.
[24:19.67]Oh, really?
[24:21.67]Good luck.
[24:22.39]I got the magic hat.
[24:23.71]That's my hat.
[24:24.71]Ah, yeah.
[24:24.89]That's me.
[24:27.72]You can put my old dirty sweaty hat on if you want.
[24:31.53]Does it smell like me in there?
[24:33.13]It's just the same hat.
[24:34.27]Hold on, there's a thorium deposit over here.
[24:36.18]I gotta get it.
[24:38.14]Oh, that's not you!
[24:39.94]I thought this old guy was you for a second.
[24:43.76]Wasn't this game Ster's idea?
[24:46.18]It was!
[24:46.74]I really had high hopes.
[24:48.80]This is like your idea to play this together.
[24:51.10]Yeah, you wanna play Necropolis on stream together?
[24:55.33]Oh yeah, cool!
[24:56.29]It's like 30 bucks.
[24:57.19]We're gonna stream it for like 19 minutes.
[25:02.06]Enemies just keep spawning out of nowhere.
[25:04.36]I'm going to dazzle this guy.
[25:09.01]Don't let this guy live.
[25:10.29]Oh, there was a guy behind me to dazzle.
[25:12.01]I'm okay.
[25:12.63]You dazzled me.
[25:13.85]Sorry.
[25:14.43]Had to dazzle somebody.
[25:15.03]Apparently, dazzling reduces your max stamina for some reason.
[25:20.67]So it's an ability that you'll never use.
[25:24.73]This is what I've learned.
[25:25.77]I'm not going to lie.
[25:26.46]Yeah.
[25:27.90]This game makes me kind of want to throw up.
[25:30.32]That's what I'm saying.
[25:32.83]I'm going to be honest.
[25:34.09]I'm going to be completely and totally honest.
[25:38.03]Turning around for some reason makes me want to never play the game again.
[25:43.55]Watch out!
[25:46.69]It's way too zoomed in.
[25:47.81]I don't know if it's that.
[25:50.21]I think it's the colors.
[25:52.41]Warty Fingal Blaster.
[25:55.11]Your name is very hard to say.
[25:56.37]Listen to me.
[25:57.51]Warty Fingal Blaster.
[25:59.97]Welcome back to four months, dude.
[26:01.05]Thank you so much for your continued support of the channel.
[26:03.27]I'm ready to go on health, so let it kill me, and I'll get the full heal from you.
[26:06.35]And then we got PC Renegade for two months back-to-back-to-back jacks.
[26:10.25]Welcome back.
[26:10.59]Thanks.
[26:13.73]Just kill me and resurrect me.
[26:17.77]Oh, we can just do it to each other.
[26:21.20]Alright, yeah.
[26:22.38]You want a free health potion?
[26:23.94]Kill your friend.
[26:24.62]This is a different enemy.
[26:28.40]This guy doesn't have a beard.
[26:29.22]Ow.
[26:37.52]Oh, I think there's a dash, actually.
[26:41.24]How do you dash?
[26:42.94]It's the same button that it is on.
[26:44.32]Okay.
[26:48.24]That helps.
[26:50.02]Man, I took one point of damage.
[26:51.10]You want to resurrect me real quick?
[26:53.30]We like... Oh, hey, you know what?
[26:54.76]Kill me.
[26:55.34]Resurrect me.
[26:55.78]You just took... I took way too much damage there.
[27:02.15]Don't die.
[27:02.73]Oh, you're... After this fight... Yeah, after this fight, make sure we get you back to full health.
[27:09.25]Make sure you kill me.
[27:10.13]Okay, resurrect me.
[27:10.89]Yeah.
[27:11.53]We want to be healthy.
[27:13.07]Yeah, okay, good.
[27:17.89]What is this?
[27:18.25]What's this?
[27:18.82]Oh, it's just a frozen flame.
[27:20.22]Chrono Cross!
[27:21.30]I hurt me.
[27:22.04]You're going to have to kill me and resurrect me.
[27:23.16]You're going to have to kill me, too, and resurrect me.
[27:24.86]I took a little damage there myself.
[27:34.38]Oh, let's go.
[27:39.25]Is there a baby?
[27:44.01]Okay, now you have to.
[27:44.95]I am.
[27:48.67]I got all turned around.
[27:49.65]Which way are we supposed to be going?
[27:51.19]I don't know.
[27:53.71]They might be diminishing returns with what we're doing, though.
[27:57.14]Is that what people are telling you?
[27:58.38]Because it doesn't look like there is.
[27:59.66]I just feel like if that mechanic was in the game, it would be diminished returns on that move.
[28:05.58]I think you feel... I think your feelings are correct, but the reality is different.
[28:11.33]This requires $200 to open.
[28:14.71]Why?
[28:15.07]Gotta wait for the door anyway.
[28:18.29]Did I even spend the 200 money?
[28:20.27]I don't think I even spent anything.
[28:25.33]Boss.
[28:25.81]That's a boss.
[28:27.54]Look at that.
[28:27.98]Okay, you thought this game wasn't like, that's a boss.
[28:30.50]We're gonna activate the pool.
[28:32.00]I don't have 500 gems.
[28:33.36]Fuck.
[28:33.48]Can we pool our money together?
[28:34.94]Can we like buy a pizza together?
[28:36.20]I can just go in it.
[28:42.64]No, it's not going to work.
[28:44.90]That thing's going to knock over and that guy's going to walk up with his big sword in his hand.
[28:52.75]Zalada.
[28:56.23]Oh, there's the old man in the mountain.
[29:00.83]Only one of us can talk to him at a time.
[29:02.37]Okay, standard rationed old man's essentials.
[29:08.11]Rotten food.
[29:12.00]Scroll of Identify.
[29:13.14]I'm going to buy one.
[29:16.18]I don't know if that was... Buy one of these.
[29:20.47]Okay.
[29:22.53]Can you only hold one item?
[29:23.19]I don't know.
[29:26.21]Oh, you can do multiple weapons.
[29:29.69]Can you change weapons?
[29:31.65]Left on the d-pad.
[29:36.69]Haha, you can't buy anything.
[29:38.03]I was trying to kill you both.
[29:42.63]Oh, I thought, like, I want to use the vendor.
[29:44.96]Go away.
[29:46.74]No, I wanted to, like, kill the vendor while you were using it and you.
[29:51.98]Oh, what's this?
[29:52.50]Ooh.
[29:58.62]I don't know.
[30:01.40]This is the library over here.
[30:02.80]I think those are the permanent upgrades that you can get to your character.
[30:05.90]Right.
[30:07.12]That type of currency.
[30:08.54]Jeremy, next time you see Star in real life, kick the shit out of him.
[30:12.65]I agree.
[30:13.69]What do we do?
[30:14.89]By the way, it's gonna be thundering and lightning-ing.
[30:17.87]Today?
[30:19.11]It sounds like it.
[30:19.63]I'm gonna have to close my roof.
[30:20.53]There's no- I can hear it.
[30:23.37]Okay.
[30:34.66]We're gonna have to 1, 2, 3 this.
[30:38.44]Okay.
[30:40.04]There's nothing to 1, 2, 3.
[30:40.56]Are you sure?
[30:43.14]Alright, ready?
[30:44.10]I guess we can 1, 2, 3.
[30:44.70]Wait, no, no.
[30:45.50]Here comes the 1, 2, 3.
[30:46.28]It's coming up.
[30:47.90]Wow, that's a very long 1, 2, 3.
[30:49.68]This is more like a 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[30:53.70]I can't stand it.
[30:54.24]I have to do it.
[30:55.52]I'm fine.
[31:01.23]Damn it.
[31:01.67]Why?
[31:02.71]You're fine.
[31:03.29]You're alive.
[31:03.93]You're here.
[31:04.35]Yeah, nice try.
[31:08.57]Don't think I knew you were going to try to do that after I tried to do it to you.
[31:17.21]I just like oh god.
[31:18.49]Oh my god Something something's really not happening.
[31:23.20]That's something's wrong.
[31:25.20]Something's really nothing wrong.
[31:26.66]I Don't know what happened.
[31:28.80]I don't know where I am Where'd I go?
[31:35.46]I'm in a different zone There's a chest here
[31:42.64]Nice!
[31:44.30]I got a fucking free chest for like falling through the Earth.
[31:46.62]There's a bird in here.
[31:49.26]What the fuck?
[31:50.31]What?
[31:54.07]Yeah, you wish you had a bird chest in your zone.
[32:01.59]We're playing two different games now.
[32:05.03]Oh, you just respawned at the top of the elevator.
[32:08.19]What?
[32:09.13]Then where was the bird chest?
[32:12.01]You just walked to a different area that we haven't been at yet.
[32:15.17]There's no bird chest.
[32:16.35]Yes, there is.
[32:17.63]Okay.
[32:18.45]There's no bird chest, he says.
[32:19.79]No, not there's no bird chest.
[32:21.86]I know what you're talking about.
[32:22.86]There's a turkey in a box, right?
[32:26.54]I'm just saying you didn't have to go that way.
[32:28.38]There's no map.
[32:29.32]You're going to have to come back.
[32:30.36]I have no fucking idea where you're talking about because everything is the same.
[32:36.14]Can you look through the ground and you can see my name?
[32:39.09]Oh, God.
[32:39.67]Okay.
[32:40.65]Good luck.
[32:44.36]There's a turkey in a box.
[32:47.79]Oh, I found it!
[32:53.05]Found it!
[32:53.53]I found the secret passage.
[32:59.41]Hold on, I got a fucking bedman chasing me.
[33:01.12]Wait, wait, hold on, this is gonna be funny.
[33:03.30]You're gonna be able to see this.
[33:04.88]Go to the elevator.
[33:07.38]I'm gonna send you a surprise.
[33:10.58]Fucking get back down there, you're missing the surprise.
[33:20.58]You're alive, you're fine.
[33:21.62]No, no, no, no.
[33:23.04]Don't.
[33:23.64]Why?
[33:24.94]Don't.
[33:25.52]Don't.
[33:26.05]Look, look at it.
[33:27.11]Oh, look, this looks cool now.
[33:31.01]Don't.
[33:31.41]Don't.
[33:31.87]Don't.
[33:32.35]Don't.
[33:32.71]I'm not gonna do anything.
[33:34.01]Every time I say don't, it resets the amount of time that you're gonna do it by like five seconds.
[33:38.91]Oh, cool.
[33:39.43]Golden chest.
[33:40.85]Wish I had a golden chest instead of a turkey box.
[33:43.76]Yeah.
[33:44.26]If only you'd come this way, then you would've got the hat that I have.
[33:47.24]Fuck up.
[33:51.43]Fucking kill the big Triforce of Wisdom!
[33:57.35]Watch out!
[33:57.67]Whoa!
[34:00.95]Seriously, the back of these spiders is jermaMoon.
[34:02.95]Hey, can you do me a favor?
[34:05.45]Can you give me a full heal with your heal power you have?
[34:07.69]Okay, can you do me a favor?
[34:12.19]Yeah.
[34:15.27]You want me to heal you?
[34:16.11]Yeah, I could use a full heal.
[34:22.41]Resurrecto?
[34:24.69]Resaric?
[34:25.15]Does that mean, like, heal in Spanish or something?
[34:29.76]Yeah.
[34:31.62]God, did you hear that funny joke I just said?
[34:34.26]No.
[34:34.44]Alright, read this.
[34:38.97]This floor was spotless last weekend until the grind threw a keg out.
[34:49.04]This is a very narrow hallway.
[34:50.50]I'm just going to kind of let you do your thing in there.
[34:54.30]Yeah, and when I die, you just come resurrect me and clean up.
[34:58.18]You just beat the shit out of me.
[34:59.75]Like, my health doesn't matter.
[35:00.89]Okay, do it.
[35:01.95]Kill me.
[35:03.25]This is the worst.
[35:05.73]This is awful.
[35:09.39]Hey, you know, I kind of took a couple beats there, too.
[35:11.28]Could you do me a favor?
[35:13.14]Yeah, no problem.
[35:14.00]Did anyone here go to school for, like, game design?
[35:17.99]Oh god.
[35:18.39]Are these guys friendly?
[35:26.96]Yeah.
[35:32.00]No they're not.
[35:33.54]You lied to me!
[35:41.32]Okay, we all know what's going to happen here, so I'm just gonna mash and kill these guys real quick.
[35:50.16]You better not die.
[35:51.46]Okay, let's go game design.
[35:53.78]Alright, hold on.
[35:58.25]I'll save you the trouble.
[36:01.55]Are we losing items?
[36:04.39]I have no idea.
[36:06.03]Yeah, I definitely have less max health for sure.
[36:13.42]We're making steady progress, I'll call it.
[36:16.10]We went through the bone tunnel.
[36:20.56]I just wanna, like, let's, like, you know, speedrun, you know what I'm saying?
[36:28.52]Fine, fuck it, let's go.
[36:31.55]I'm going.
[36:37.33]Left turn.
[36:42.91]Oh, shit, this looks, this looks like something.
[36:46.57]This looks important.
[36:50.53]I don't think it is.
[36:51.59]You sure?
[36:52.05]Well, we kind of have the whole zone following us.
[36:55.43]No, no, we just came from that way.
[36:59.26]This way.
[37:01.24]You sure?
[37:01.60]This way.
[37:05.08]Everything looks the same.
[37:06.66]Come on.
[37:06.86]How do you know?
[37:07.81]We took a... Watch out.
[37:09.01]There's two spiders.
[37:11.65]And a golden goose.
[37:14.43]This way.
[37:15.77]That's a red guy.
[37:16.65]I haven't seen a red guy yet.
[37:17.73]We got invaded.
[37:18.25]There's two invaders.
[37:21.99]Oh, wow.
[37:22.81]Just keep running.
[37:23.65]Just keep running.
[37:24.79]Oh, Jesus.
[37:25.75]No, there's even more.
[37:27.03]What?
[37:27.25]There's fucking traps?
[37:33.16]How did we get through that?
[37:34.20]I don't know.
[37:34.58]Please tell me there's another, like, elevator.
[37:40.96]We're just playing tag.
[37:46.45]Dump that.
[37:46.92]Okay, let's keep going.
[37:53.78]I don't know where going is and keep that way.
[37:58.20]Open the door.
[37:58.62]It costs money, I think.
[38:01.68]Hold on.
[38:02.10]Kill the invader.
[38:10.31]What the?
[38:11.61]This is the most spider I've ever seen before.
[38:17.19]Okay, do you need health?
[38:18.63]No, I'm fine.
[38:20.23]Now I do.
[38:23.53]Now I need more health.
[38:25.11]How about you?
[38:25.53]You alright?
[38:26.91]No, I can use... No, no, don't.
[38:29.00]Wait, yeah, I killed him.
[38:32.20]I'm gonna lose stamina, but I'm gonna gain health.
[38:36.48]Yeah, thanks.
[38:36.86]Alright, we found the entranceway.
[38:39.97]Okay.
[38:42.42]Boss.
[38:45.38]Boss room.
[38:46.04]Smells like a boss room.
[38:47.68]Yep, this is gonna be an animal boss.
[39:00.35]You very awkwardly also can't, like, fight the same things.
[39:03.97]It's like that in Dark Souls.
[39:04.81]Oh, I picked up some essential oil.
[39:06.27]You have a bike?
[39:07.20]Animal boss.
[39:08.06]Mice, mice.
[39:09.52]Mice?
[39:10.72]Very blind mice.
[39:12.83]God, you distracted me.
[39:14.97]What the heck, man?
[39:15.65]Shut up.
[39:17.02]Oh, man.
[39:18.10]Alright, who's to heal the first person?
[39:19.72]Fuck you, dude.
[39:23.12]The boss was three spiders.
[39:25.20]No, the boss is in this room.
[39:27.80]So heal up.
[39:34.54]we're gonna beat this game if we die where do we go back to the checkpoint uh the very beginning oh geez alright well let's kill the boss yep this is a boss from if I've ever seen one no I heard one person saying like in a Steam review that them and some friends played together and when they got to uh an area that looked like the first boss they beat it and then the game was over oh
[40:04.43]Watch out for the two shield maids.
[40:06.08]Behind you!
[40:20.29]Gosh.
[40:21.97]Gosh.
[40:23.11]Why are we fighting things?
[40:25.23]I don't know.
[40:25.69]Let's do the run strategy.
[40:28.63]I want that shield.
[40:29.85]Fuck, I can't pick up his tower shield.
[40:32.56]That's a big guy.
[40:33.54]Is that a boss?
[40:35.52]There's two bosses in here.
[40:36.64]Two bosses.
[40:37.60]Run.
[40:38.04]Yeah, run.
[40:38.98]Let's not fight the bosses.
[40:39.90]Run.
[40:43.76]Gank.
[40:44.52]Gank.
[40:46.04]Gank.
[40:49.06]There's a chest.
[40:50.83]There's like spikes in front of the chest.
[40:52.81]Run away from the chest.
[40:53.47]There's a dead end.
[40:55.17]Oh god.
[40:57.07]We're hiding.
[40:58.17]Time to fight.
[41:00.35]Hey, uh, can you heal me?
[41:02.13]If we sit in this corner, will we be able to heal?
[41:03.61]Uh, you need to heal me.
[41:10.53]How the fuck are you?
[41:14.18]What?
[41:14.46]Where are you?
[41:16.22]Why am, what happened?
[41:17.06]Why am I this guy?
[41:18.02]I know, but, like, why...
[41:29.36]Maybe if I tap A, I can resurrect.
[41:33.53]The hell was that?
[41:37.11]He's walking on their heads.
[41:39.39]Damn, I wish I could see the funny thing.
[41:47.99]I got you.
[41:50.17]No, you don't.
[41:52.45]No, you don't.
[41:53.91]I teleported again.
[41:56.19]Wait, what?
[41:56.67]Yeah.
[41:58.24]Were you dead for too long?
[41:59.60]I just started resurrecting you.
[42:00.94]And I get a free chest.
[42:03.16]What?
[42:03.50]What?
[42:03.78]You, like, went through the wall with the resurrection or something.
[42:06.90]Well, thanks for the free stuff.
[42:08.66]That was the hat I had before.
[42:11.10]No, I think this is, like, the spawn room.
[42:12.36]You took too long.
[42:15.15]That's... No?
[42:18.05]Yeah, see?
[42:18.91]Like, I can see... You took too long, and I came back to where we were.
[42:25.39]Okay.
[42:26.19]So I have to make the elevator come up again.
[42:29.33]Really?
[42:41.58]Yeah.
[42:45.76]I'm in like hell over here.
[42:50.10]You're just like doing an 80s song thing.
[42:52.74]How do I get down here?
[42:58.97]Dude, there was just a fucking planet.
[43:01.58]What's this planet?
[43:02.68]I need to see what this is.
[43:03.46]Oh my god.
[43:06.16]What the fuck?
[43:06.78]I can see the whole world.
[43:08.78]The whole world is at my fingertips.
[43:10.46]I can see where you are.
[43:11.24]This elevator takes so long.
[43:17.71]I can see the whole map editor.
[43:22.13]Just take some time.
[43:25.21]If you're gonna be alright.
[43:29.33]I killed them all.
[43:30.39]Did you actually?
[43:35.83]I'm so dead.
[43:37.51]Well, I can come heal you in a minute.
[43:39.86]I have to wait for the elevator.
[43:41.56]It made me... Is this the elevator button?
[43:45.46]Yeah, where is it?
[43:46.22]What the f... I'll get you.
[43:54.74]Where is this fucking elevator?
[43:58.36]Am I stupid?
[43:59.14]Please tell me if I am.
[44:00.33]Is the big blue crystal the elevator please come up call button?
[44:05.77]I can hear it.
[44:06.81]I can hear the elevator.
[44:08.71]What the?
[44:09.45]Where?
[44:09.87]Where?
[44:10.29]What the fuck was this?
[44:12.87]I'm coming.
[44:14.69]I'm coming.
[44:18.02]No, I'm going up.
[44:19.84]I'm going up.
[44:21.88]This is not the right way.
[44:23.26]I'm going up.
[44:28.41]Where's your body?
[44:30.31]How are you alive?
[44:31.73]I just respawned because I died.
[44:33.06]It's a long story.
[44:35.32]And I spawned in the trail of enemies.
[44:41.38]Who is it talking to?
[44:42.28]Where are you?
[44:43.02]You're up top.
[44:43.88]What?
[44:46.97]I have no fucking idea.
[44:52.87]It's so much easier for me to die here.
[44:57.35]See?
[44:58.47]Okay, so I was on the right floor?
[45:00.75]This one requires 200 bucks!
[45:09.54]Oh my goodness.
[45:10.36]Alright, I'm coming.
[45:14.14]So I have to just go this way.
[45:16.50]I don't know, dude.
[45:17.96]Do you have any idea what to do?
[45:21.46]I have no idea what to do.
[45:24.59]I'm going up again.
[45:30.12]Where is this taking me?
[45:30.96]Is this taking me back, like, the long way?
[45:34.06]What is this giant crystal?
[45:37.65]I think we're both seeing equally interesting things on our own.
[45:40.85]Yeah, I... I want to show you something, like, when the stream's over.
[45:44.71]I found, like, a tutorial room.
[45:47.67]A what?
[45:48.06]I don't know.
[45:49.32]There's, like, a big crystal in here.
[45:50.74]I found the Naru.
[45:53.04]Great job.
[45:53.90]Um, my friend... Okay, cool.
[45:58.22]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[46:03.50]How do I get back to my friend?
[46:04.80]I remember this place, the ladder.
[46:07.86]If I, like, hold X, do I teleport to him?
[46:09.54]Jeremiah, Jeremiah.
[46:10.56]Oh, my God, I know exactly where you are and where exactly you have to go, but I don't know how to tell you.
[46:15.08]Honestly, here's the problem.
[46:16.98]There's a hole in the floor, and it's the elevator, and you have to go down that elevator.
[46:20.00]Go down the elevator.
[46:20.80]It's, like, right there, yes.
[46:21.56]Go down the elevator.
[46:23.06]Go down the elevator.
[46:23.98]Do you want me to go down this elevator?
[46:25.90]Yes.
[46:26.67]The elevator that only goes up.
[46:28.87]No, you have to interact with the crystal, then it comes back up.
[46:31.89]Dimwit.
[46:32.95]Dude, give me a little bit of slack.
[46:34.45]We sprinted through the whole fucking game so far.
[46:38.19]There's nothing for me to remember.
[46:39.51]All I remember is running straight and left and right.
[46:44.45]Oh, thank God.
[46:46.24]Took you fucking long enough.
[46:50.76]Jerma has no concept of space or time.
[46:52.56]No, I don't.
[46:54.08]There's no mini-map and you sprint through a whole level.
[46:57.90]It was really simple.
[47:00.27]Oh, what you just shot did.
[47:01.31]I can see you right now.
[47:02.47]Look at that bad gamer over there, not even fucking at the last boss over that way.
[47:09.19]The problem is that you're still playing this game.
[47:15.02]Talking about space and time, though, I don't remember how to get back to where you're coming down.
[47:20.05]That's what I'm saying.
[47:20.67]I have no idea.
[47:22.37]All I remember is running as fast as we could.
[47:24.05]You have to go down.
[47:25.33]I'm on the same level as you.
[47:26.27]You're down now.
[47:27.14]I can see you through the walls, but I don't know how to get back there.
[47:30.14]I can open this door.
[47:31.20]I'm going to have to run through everything again, aren't I?
[47:34.22]Yeah.
[47:37.37]Hold on, wait.
[47:39.65]Is there a shortcut so I can just go that way?
[47:43.35]Nothing's gonna fucking die here again.
[47:44.81]There's no way I'm gonna make it alive.
[47:47.15]Wait, hold on.
[47:47.91]I think I'm almost at you.
[47:48.90]Do you see the big Statue of Liberty?
[47:51.38]No, I see your name through walls.
[47:52.78]Go to the Statue of Liberty.
[47:56.28]What am I doing?
[47:57.64]You're running away from me, I think.
[48:02.18]Give me that item!
[48:02.90]There's like a fucking cool shield on the ground.
[48:05.40]Watch the traps!
[48:10.16]Wait, are you behind me?
[48:12.12]Yes.
[48:13.75]Wait, you're actually in that room with the Statue of Liberty?
[48:16.29]Yes!
[48:17.88]Alright, well, I'm... I can't really come back to you.
[48:20.02]That's how I said watch for the trap!
[48:22.40]I thought you were stream sniping me.
[48:28.38]Okay, mob him up.
[48:29.22]Mob him up.
[48:29.92]We're gonna farm some XP.
[48:31.22]I have no health.
[48:33.24]You're just gonna get us killed.
[48:38.61]Okay, come with me.
[48:39.49]Jesus.
[48:40.11]Jesus!
[48:42.12]Mop him up, dude.
[48:42.88]You fucking had the right idea.
[48:44.10]Hey, watch out for Blackbeard!
[48:46.92]Dude, that's like Mr. T. It's a guy with like a mohawk and a beard.
[48:52.00]Wait, what?
[48:55.64]I just have to kill like a whole other... Alright, well, get ready, because here comes the Mr. T enemy.
[49:01.46]I... Oh, just speedrun.
[49:06.79]Wait, what?
[49:07.61]I'll keep going back to...
[49:12.87]Oh shit, this is where we came from.
[49:14.51]This is what I've told you.
[49:15.35]This is what I've been telling you this whole time.
[49:21.13]I was doing fine without you.
[49:23.59]Hey, Avenger75, Eric Hein... Oh boy, hold on.
[49:34.00]You killed me.
[49:35.88]You killed me and then died.
[49:39.10]It's up to you.
[49:39.66]This is the game you wanted to play.
[49:40.73]It's up to you.
[49:43.07]But, uh, Avenger75, thanks for four months.
[49:45.45]Eric Hendernart, or Hendinart, Hendinart, thank you for two months.
[49:50.65]StarCraftZergresh, welcome back for four months.
[49:53.63]The three is thanks for your subscriptions.
[49:55.23]It just feels so slow.
[49:56.94]Like, I don't want to fight anything.
[49:59.00]It's not fun to fight things.
[50:00.66]Hey, I have one all-time item smashed.
[50:07.30]And fighting things is the whole game.
[50:13.97]I'm doing one more.
[50:14.83]Maybe it's our characters.
[50:16.45]I want to do one more so that we can't possibly refund it.
[50:22.16]I think we have to be the same character.
[50:25.18]I already started.
[50:25.92]Let's go.
[50:27.58]I'll be the son, you'll be the daughter.
[50:28.64]We get a plus 10% health bonus for being the same faction.
[50:34.41]Okay.
[50:36.59]Okay.
[50:42.18]Okay, get on the elevator.
[50:43.20]Get on the elevator.
[50:43.93]It's real like the skeletons that drop ten gems.
[50:46.23]I am so busted.
[50:47.21]I can see about 5% of my screen right now.
[50:56.52]Why is a benevolent lord person talking about getting busted by his parents?
[51:12.74]Oh, I'm so lucky.
[51:13.92]Don't listen to him.
[51:16.09]It's Jabba the Hutt guiding you.
[51:29.04]Oh, nice, like, dead end.
[51:31.04]Dead, oh, nice deados.
[51:37.32]Let me get this guy.
[51:40.61]Let me get him with a backstab.
[51:44.54]Ah, fuck!
[51:45.28]Dude, he must have heard the footsteps!
[51:53.72]Animal boss, hippo.
[51:55.84]First it was the camel boss, now we're in the hippo bosses area.
[52:00.41]Oh shit, is this hippo bosses?
[52:02.61]We're gonna start seeing different water and jungle themed enemies.
[52:07.55]This is the hippo campus.
[52:09.33]This is the boss's name.
[52:10.49]Hippo campus.
[52:13.99]Cool.
[52:14.65]Oh, this is a hippo.
[52:15.41]I didn't even see the hippo.
[52:16.41]Now I see the hippo.
[52:22.57]Ow.
[52:28.94]I got an unknown potion.
[52:30.46]I'm sure it'll kill me.
[52:33.58]Watch out for the trap.
[52:36.09]Watch out for the moon spiders.
[52:38.59]The moon.
[52:41.43]Make sure you eat food of the arcane variety and you collect creatures droppings.
[52:47.11]Every time you kill an enemy just cover the screen up.
[52:50.09]Can we get some moons in the chat please?
[52:53.08]Can we get some moons in both chats?
[53:00.78]I want like stars mods to be fucking pissed off.
[53:04.24]My mods gave up a long time ago.
[53:13.69]I feel like if we tell everyone what the other game is... They're going to be like, get out of this now.
[53:19.20]Yeah, they're going to say, like, leave.
[53:21.06]Just stop.
[53:23.12]Well, who knows?
[53:23.74]The other game... God, dude, come on.
[53:26.18]Heal me.
[53:27.70]I want a heal from your overhand smash in my head.
[53:37.27]Sick.
[53:38.13]My maps put it in sub only.
[53:41.16]But, like, my subs are... We share a lot of subs.
[53:43.78]There's still a lot of moons.
[53:45.68]To be fair.
[53:46.32]Put it in sub only.
[53:48.38]Alright, in that case, I'm gonna, like, have you put up, like, the jermaMoon on your chat, too.
[53:54.62]Like, you upload it to Twitch as well.
[53:56.61]So, like, even when you do... Even when you do have it in sub mode, they can just still fucking do it.
[54:05.17]Let me get this guy.
[54:09.67]You get this one, though.
[54:14.31]You just killed the old man in a tree.
[54:18.56]You think I wanted to wait here for a thousand years?
[54:23.42]You just killed the old man in a tree.
[54:27.65]What?
[54:28.43]Shut up.
[54:29.71]Oh!
[54:30.05]There's the boss!
[54:32.67]I wanna kill this thing.
[54:43.23]Okay, that is the strategy.
[54:44.25]You get them all to chase you, and then I can hit them all in the back for free.
[54:47.95]Not when he does the fucking sphincter move.
[54:53.23]I mean, spin, no.
[54:54.18]Why did I say sphincter?
[54:57.04]Oh, shit, dude.
[54:57.88]I'm low on HP.
[55:00.20]Intense, intense fucking game right here.
[55:02.88]Intense, okay.
[55:03.36]Alright, I want to heal me.
[55:05.18]Big boss didn't even drop anything.
[55:06.82]Don't, don't.
[55:07.88]I'm not low on HP.
[55:09.04]Oh, I thought, that's just what we do.
[55:10.48]We, like, refresh.
[55:13.99]Jacob Jacob 71 200 point because I thanks up and do welcome welcome to the Welcome to the old man in a tray Thanks a lot dude welcome to the old men in the tray Also, once you start doing that like spin with this weapon.
[55:32.68]Yeah You can't like turn it all oh Okay, just a little different.
[55:38.58]I thought it was pretty shit.
[55:39.72]Oh
[55:43.31]Oh, watch out for this guy.
[55:44.38]The bearded guy.
[55:47.20]Who has a very different attack pattern than the skeletons.
[55:49.90]Than the every other thing.
[55:50.80]Uh-oh.
[55:58.13]Does that mean the ceiling caves in eventually or something?
[56:03.69]Yeah, the ceiling comes down and...
[56:12.28]Attack pattern.
[56:12.90]Here he goes.
[56:13.46]Big smash.
[56:14.68]Dash around the side.
[56:15.50]Oh.
[56:15.56]You think I could do a YouTube tutorial about that?
[56:20.73]Yeah.
[56:21.15]Okay, guys.
[56:21.57]So what happens here is when he raises his hand up, you want to dash to the left.
[56:24.85]And that's going to get you behind him, allowing for two or three different attack patterns.
[56:30.75]Once you clear him out, he's cleared out for good.
[56:33.88]And then it cuts to another fucking cool tutorial.
[56:40.24]I'm trying to kill me.
[56:43.81]What's with this red beam?
[56:47.12]Oh!
[56:47.94]It's got me!
[56:48.86]Dude, you walked into the trap.
[56:50.64]Watch out!
[56:57.26]How'd you do that fucking move?
[56:58.55]Cool!
[57:00.15]Dude, I'm just trying to, like, you know what I'm saying?
[57:02.19]Hey, you know what?
[57:02.95]Can I just... I gotta fucking pull here.
[57:04.37]You gotta kill me.
[57:10.85]Top 10 Necropolis Bosses.
[57:15.70]Coming in at number 10.
[57:16.70]Then it's like, don't shoot.
[57:18.18]Then there's a big thing comes on screen and it's like, what's it gonna be?
[57:23.03]The Hippo Boss.
[57:24.67]Hitmo Camp is one of the cooler bosses in any Souls game.
[57:30.29]The sheer power and how large he is makes up for the difficult fight.
[57:35.38]That's why it clocks in at number 10.
[57:38.80]Number 9.
[57:40.56]Number nine.
[57:41.32]The Camel Boss.
[57:43.03]Camel Boss, the two-hump mechanic where you have to hit the two humps.
[57:47.11]What an odd mechanic.
[57:48.73]That's why it's number nine.
[57:53.15]Clocking in at number eight on our Wheel of Fortune, so to speak.
[57:56.62]Don't die.
[57:57.24]If you die, it's game over.
[57:58.38]No, if you die, it's game over and we're done.
[58:01.64]This is serious business now.
[58:02.88]You can't die.
[58:03.56]Clocking in at number seven.
[58:05.68]The three twins.
[58:07.34]The three twins is one of my favorite fights of the entire series.
[58:10.98]The mechanic where you have to resurrect your friend.
[58:14.04]No!
[58:14.84]Oh!
[58:15.24]We're playing BattleBots.
[58:29.31]BattleBots is the other game.
[58:31.06]You build robots and me and Jerm are going to fight.
[58:33.40]Yeah, we're going to play BattleBots with each other.
[58:39.93]It's going to be fun.
[58:43.33]Clocking in at number six.
[58:47.23]God damn it.
[58:51.84]Necropolis.
[58:52.56]Okay, what's my play time in Necropolis?
[58:55.46]Oh, we did it.
[58:56.82]Did we do it?
[58:57.94]Chat, 56 minutes played.
[59:00.15]What does that mean?
[59:03.08]That means refund.
[59:10.58]Clocking in at number five.
[59:13.12]The Steam refund page.
[59:17.12]Getting to this point was very difficult.
[59:19.98]And it proved to be the harder of the middle of the road bosses in the Souls games.
[59:32.05]Okay, let's open BattleBots.
[59:34.16]It's probably going to be really loud.
[59:35.64]It's going to be very loud.
[59:36.52]So how about you ruin your stream and then tell me how much you ruined it and I'll... So are you just turning off your stream?
[59:45.99]Oh.
[59:48.99]Are you going to play anything after BattleBots?
[59:52.09]I don't know.
[59:53.69]It depends on how long we play BattleBots.
[59:55.96]I can't imagine it being more than an hour or two.
[60:01.75]I don't know, I guess I'll just... Just stream it.
[60:05.33]There's no reason for you to turn off your stream right now.
[60:13.24]Because if you end up going and I don't or vice versa, it doesn't matter.
[60:18.80]So, let's figure out how do we play this game together.
[60:28.04]It does not have a 1920x1080 option.
[60:31.98]After a great start.
[60:34.30]I'm going to change my Steam what you're playing list.
[60:41.35]Wait, it does.
[60:43.11]It doesn't have one for the windowed version.
[60:45.45]That's weird.
[60:48.65]What's it called?
[60:49.23]Robot Arena 3.
[60:52.39]It actually has a
[61:07.33]Somebody just walked in your room and stabbed you in the back What are you doing?
[61:16.84]What's the matter?
[61:17.98]Oh my god, mute your- like an OBS mute
[61:23.18]when you open this game.
[61:26.44]Hold on.
[61:29.30]Okay, I'm gonna... I'm gonna mute.
[61:32.19]You won't be able to hear a star, so hold on.
[61:35.47]Is it really... Should I take my headphones out?
[61:50.90]He's still screaming.
[61:57.16]1920 we want to do bed oh god this is so stupid
[62:32.25]Not only is it loud, it's like fucking hard metal.
[62:38.93]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[62:48.17]Just blasting this like generic hard heavy rock music.
[62:53.39]Seriously, my ears are like ringing.
[62:57.96]That also gave me the classic drama instant headache.
[63:00.50]Oh, that was fucking funny.
[63:09.30]So I'm gonna turn up to three.
[63:13.06]I had music playing as well for the downtime.
[63:16.53]I couldn't... At 1% volume, I can't even hear that.
[63:21.37]Okay.
[63:22.83]Okay, so... What the fuck is this?
[63:26.09]Create?
[63:27.51]Choose a logo for your team?
[63:29.43]Uh...
[63:35.24]Is there more?
[63:36.72]There is more.
[63:38.34]Oh, definitely the spooky fucking green ghost.
[63:42.24]No.
[63:42.64]I just need to pick quickly so I can get to it.
[63:48.58]Uh, I got my, I got my, uh, I got my shit ready.
[63:56.31]Damn, I'm gonna go with Rancid.
[63:59.33]Hey, what's your team name?
[64:01.91]Mine's Rancid.
[64:04.55]Mine was Ster.
[64:07.17]Find games online or create your own and invite your friends.
[64:09.65]I think that's what we're doing, right?
[64:10.61]Do you want to add me or what?
[64:13.90]I don't know.
[64:14.34]You figure out how to invite me.
[64:15.64]This is on you.
[64:17.58]Alright.
[64:19.20]Oh, fuck.
[64:19.62]Whoops.
[64:21.32]Green Spy gave me money.
[64:22.64]It says this is for Jerma.
[64:24.26]Since I can't give it to him, let him know.
[64:26.64]It's never getting to you.
[64:29.29]Wait, don't you still owe me like $300 or something?
[64:32.47]What?
[64:33.05]Since when?
[64:36.49]I can't remember what it was for, I guess you don't.
[64:48.18]I swear you do, though.
[64:51.28]We'll figure that out, I don't know.
[64:52.62]Alright, let's see if I can knock away two.
[64:54.66]Alright, did you get it?
[64:59.84]Did you get it?
[65:05.09]I clicked it, nothing happened.
[65:07.82]nothing happened nothing happened really let's try it again nothing happened oh how about you try inviting me wait so I go to online I see friend invite from darren oh well what the hell
[65:32.77]Uh, well, I backed out because you said it didn't work, so now you just invite me.
[65:35.99]Oh my god, no, you do the same thing you just did because you already know how to do it.
[65:39.81]You just go to online and then go to create.
[65:42.33]That's it.
[65:44.29]Just name your server or something, whatever, who cares.
[65:46.47]FrogDog.
[65:47.31]Yeah, FrogDog.
[65:49.53]Weight class heavy.
[65:51.49]Unrestricted.
[65:52.17]Alright, so now you send me an invitation.
[65:55.70]Wait, no, here's the problem.
[65:56.76]No, no, no, here's the problem.
[65:58.04]What?
[65:58.80]We haven't made any bots yet.
[66:00.96]I think we like...
[66:04.42]Oh!
[66:06.48]Okay.
[66:08.82]I see what you're saying.
[66:09.76]Well, let's just find out if this does anything.
[66:11.21]That Jerma's going to pick that one, so I'm not going to.
[66:16.93]So am I inviting you or no?
[66:19.77]Yeah, just invite me.
[66:20.91]Send me an e-vite.
[66:24.07]Okay, Darren.
[66:25.09]Let's just see what happens.
[66:34.96]You know what really had me laughing the other day?
[66:37.86]A day ago, I started bursting out laughing.
[66:40.86]That guy's head at Denny's was so small.
[66:44.10]You're still on that, huh?
[66:46.67]Alright.
[66:51.21]I guess we're... It's a pre-game trash talk.
[66:56.23]You have to pick a bot.
[66:59.70]Okay, select a bot.
[67:02.25]Alright, so we can make our own bots, but... I mean, this is pre-stream.
[67:12.06]You said you know the one I'm gonna pick?
[67:14.45]Yeah.
[67:14.63]Let's see if you're right.
[67:21.02]Definitely this one.
[67:21.90]Let's see if you're correct.
[67:28.70]TheJVan, thanks JVan, I missed you from seven minutes ago.
[67:31.48]We were currently boozing music screaming in my ear.
[67:34.58]But thanks a lot, TheJVan, for your subscription.
[67:38.48]This hardcore metal in the background also is just... So we're just selecting... Alright, we're gonna go to the soccer field.
[67:47.57]You haven't picked a bot yet.
[67:48.55]Yes, I did.
[67:50.73]Oh, I can't see your bot, I guess.
[67:52.95]Pick the arena.
[67:55.56]I have no idea how to play this game.
[67:58.31]I have no idea how... I'm not picking an arena.
[68:01.16]I clicked ready at the bottom right.
[68:03.20]So did I. It says... What?
[68:06.58]What?
[68:07.94]Did you pick the soccer field or what?
[68:10.80]What are we talking about?
[68:12.53]Under select arena.
[68:14.15]There's no... Oh.
[68:16.53]You have to like say, yeah, what are you talking about?
[68:19.81]I thought... You thought... This is going to be a basic one.
[68:27.70]I thought the top thing was your bot.
[68:31.81]No, what?
[68:33.19]I thought, because, okay.
[68:34.05]Alright, I don't know how to, like, fight.
[68:36.41]I'm sure we'll figure that out.
[68:37.51]Alright, you ready?
[68:43.37]Ah, you picked the one that I thought you would.
[68:44.87]I did.
[68:45.13]Alright, well, you're going down.
[68:47.03]After this, we'll make our own bots.
[68:48.52]Yeah, this is just kind of like to learn what the game is, battle.
[68:56.37]Oh, my God.
[68:57.55]Oh, my God.
[69:00.05]How do you, like, change the camera?
[69:04.71]Oh, I'm kicking your ass right now.
[69:07.22]I can't drive in a straight line.
[69:08.86]This thing is awful.
[69:10.92]By the way, there's, like, more dumb music in the back.
[69:16.20]I think I win.
[69:23.23]Good match!
[69:24.01]Alright, let's go make bots.
[69:27.04]Okay, yeah, let's go make a bot.
[69:28.74]Let's go make a bot.
[69:31.08]Let's go in the settings.
[69:32.90]How am I supposed to know what these are?
[69:37.82]Which one is music?
[69:40.42]You go to the bot labs.
[69:41.28]Okay, that's definitely music.
[69:42.26]Alright, hold on.
[69:43.17]Let me turn my volume back.
[69:44.93]You can adjust the audio.
[69:51.98]That's definitely music, right?
[69:53.22]It has to be.
[69:56.42]Oh, God, it's over here.
[69:57.24]Okay.
[70:00.04]This is too complicated.
[70:02.05]It's too complicated?
[70:05.01]Create... Why is it... Oh, Jesus.
[70:06.43]I think I know what you mean.
[70:07.27]Build?
[70:08.71]What am I even doing?
[70:09.85]I'm testing mine.
[70:13.23]Oh, fuck.
[70:16.68]Oh.
[70:18.16]The test failed.
[70:18.94]What?
[70:26.56]Okay, build.
[70:28.16]This is so complicated, you're right.
[70:30.08]Wheels.
[70:33.04]I think I get it.
[70:35.08]I'm starting to understand.
[70:36.42]This is going to be this weird.
[70:41.10]Okay, middle.
[70:46.32]I'm just making a shelf is all I'm doing.
[70:51.39]I'm just...
[70:55.98]Okay, let's see.
[70:56.82]I've got to get a test here too.
[71:04.18]Save it.
[71:05.35]No.
[71:07.85]It's big.
[71:13.17]Okay, I've got my art class shape.
[71:18.91]Let's paint it up.
[71:20.33]Paint shop.
[71:23.90]We're such fucking idiots.
[71:25.34]What, how do I... Uh, red, uh, blue, and red, no, blue.
[71:30.91]Okay, got it.
[71:32.95]Bleed purple.
[71:33.55]twitch.tv, bleed purple.
[71:36.51]That was ro- Okay, I know what I'm doing.
[71:43.28]Okay, this is... Let's get another camera angle.
[71:47.64]Oh, yeah.
[71:50.92]Don't tell Jerma.
[71:53.64]Strat.
[71:59.16]Okay, how do I go back?
[72:07.85]How do you put wheels on?
[72:09.69]No, not like the Steam Workshop.
[72:16.09]I made something really cool.
[72:17.73]I'm ready.
[72:18.15]I am not fucking ready.
[72:20.25]I'm not even close.
[72:27.40]I think I'm going to do pretty well.
[72:31.48]How do I put this on?
[72:32.50]Oh my god, this is not a game.
[72:38.03]This is not a game.
[72:40.31]Controls?
[72:42.55]I have no idea.
[72:49.83]Let's go with... I'm just going to...
[72:57.66]What?
[72:57.82]Okay, I'm gonna... Power steering, I guess?
[73:08.97]I think you have to restart the game.
[73:14.23]Restart the game?
[73:14.97]Why?
[73:15.51]No, hold on.
[73:16.27]I'm not talking to you.
[73:22.76]These wheels are so small.
[73:25.00]No, there's a wheel inside.
[73:26.18]Oh, fuck.
[73:31.75]We should have figured out how to play this game before we did this.
[73:34.87]No.
[73:35.79]No, we shouldn't have.
[73:38.29]Hold on a minute.
[73:38.71]I got an idea.
[73:39.21]Oh, I see.
[73:42.35]Yeah, look at this.
[73:44.17]No, no, no.
[73:45.20]Okay, let's go back to...
[73:56.39]No attachments, what the fuck is it talking about?
[74:02.27]How do you, like, attach a weapon?
[74:04.78]I don't know.
[74:07.28]Build?
[74:07.62]Go to components, go to weapons.
[74:11.84]Weapons?
[74:12.24]Alright, well, so how do I, like, put a weapon on here?
[74:17.02]No attachments are available for this component.
[74:19.08]Why not?
[74:23.81]mechanics right no mounts then you probably have to there's like controls that you have to set up and everything dude how do I even move this oh hold on hold on hold on okay what
[74:46.23]You're gonna have to.
[74:47.21]Alright, so if you go to mounts and connectors, that's like how you put shit on.
[74:54.45]Sort of.
[74:54.81]I just had an epiphany.
[75:15.48]I made like a can opener.
[75:17.66]That's all I did.
[75:18.70]You just put this can opener on your fucking desktop and you can open up any can you want.
[75:23.97]I don't understand add... You get it to go to the middle.
[75:29.61]Because you have to put things on the middle and then it... Then it keeps... Please.
[75:36.49]Please stay in the middle.
[75:40.55]Mom.
[75:41.57]Mom.
[75:45.99]Wait, what the fuck?
[75:46.81]There we go.
[75:47.23]Power steering.
[75:49.59]I gotta, like, move this.
[75:52.31]How do you, like, move shit?
[75:59.51]What are we doing?
[76:03.82]Okay, hold on.
[76:04.24]There we go.
[76:05.90]Ooh.
[76:06.00]Okay.
[76:07.68]Okay.
[76:12.11]Alright.
[76:13.15]I'm making progress.
[76:14.16]I don't know about you.
[76:15.48]I'm making barely any progress.
[76:23.07]It's sideways.
[76:23.97]You need a motor.
[76:29.57]How do you... Wheels.
[76:39.10]I don't think this is the right.
[76:40.07]Oh, let's just, let's test it.
[76:42.53]Don't understand.
[76:43.39]I need like an engine.
[76:46.23]How do I like flip this and put it on the bottom as a connector?
[76:50.67]It's like always on the bottom layer.
[76:52.32]Alright, test.
[76:52.94]And always facing the wrong way.
[76:56.78]Oh, you have to place it first.
[77:00.04]And then it's.
[77:04.03]This is upside down.
[77:08.21]I'm pretty sure my thought was upside down.
[77:10.58]Fuck.
[77:15.88]Delete this.
[77:16.48]Get rid of this fucking thing.
[77:23.22]Hey, how do I delete?
[77:24.22]There we go.
[77:26.45]I'm going to delete this random fucking tire in the middle.
[77:30.59]So this is the front.
[77:31.95]Okay, hold on a second.
[77:38.63]There we are, like that.
[77:39.73]Starting to understand a little bit.
[77:45.31]I am too.
[77:47.56]Getting there.
[77:51.82]What the fuck?
[77:52.40]I've got wheels now.
[77:54.74]Why is there a fucking one underneath me?
[78:02.20]This is really gonna pay off when we get to battle each other for ten seconds.
[78:06.20]What is this even here for?
[78:09.55]Why do I have a fucking giant knife on the bottom?
[78:12.50]Let's try that.
[78:16.02]Where is the test?
[78:16.80]There we are.
[78:17.20]It doesn't drive.
[78:24.96]God damn it.
[78:48.98]This would be so dumb.
[78:58.56]Hey, at least it didn't flip this time.
[78:59.94]That's right.
[79:07.75]We're going to do a cardboard build.
[79:09.39]Get some cardboard in there.
[79:12.91]Come on.
[79:20.25]So how's your build going?
[79:33.28]The birthday cake bot.
[79:46.59]Let's get that there.
[79:51.80]Should I bring, like, the engine up or something?
[79:55.06]I'm gonna go like this.
[79:57.16]Maybe it's, like, just not supposed to be here.
[80:03.90]It's the batteries.
[80:04.92]My game's freaking out.
[80:05.80]Let's give it a little bit more balance.
[80:11.65]Are these wheels even connected to anything?
[80:13.45]What the fuck did I just do?
[80:15.75]I don't know.
[80:16.55]I just put, like, scrap metal on my shit.
[80:18.43]No, get out of here.
[80:22.10]Yeah, I don't know where Ster went.
[80:23.22]Ster muted.
[80:25.02]I don't want you stealing my secrets.
[80:27.24]Oh, okay.
[80:28.50]There's one thing I'm stuck on, okay?
[80:30.30]How do you not build on the bottom layer?
[80:32.72]I don't know.
[80:33.92]Like, the blue blueprint is always at the bottom.
[80:40.70]Ooh!
[80:41.16]Okay, I figured it out.
[80:47.28]Jesus.
[80:50.07]So... Does that mean I can actually drive the fucking thing?
[80:56.55]Okay, good.
[81:00.08]This thing fucking flies.
[81:01.52]Don't tell them my secrets, guys.
[81:06.44]Now I just need to make it so it's able to turn left and right.
[81:17.80]Don't you just want, like, your front tires to turn?
[81:21.02]I want to not place on the bottom level.
[81:25.76]I want to, like, put something on top of my robot.
[81:27.94]How do I do that?
[81:30.42]I think you have to go to, like, the layer.
[81:32.92]Pick what, like, layer you're on.
[81:33.84]It never stays on what layer that I choose.
[81:37.10]Maybe you can't.
[81:37.70]I don't know.
[81:39.38]Yeah, you can't build that.
[81:40.60]Yeah, you can't.
[81:41.50]Well, it's okay.
[81:42.69]You're fucking going to... You're going to die, dude.
[81:45.59]I hope you don't.
[81:54.40]I think we can do a little test here.
[81:59.22]I think I'm ready to fight you.
[82:01.02]You're ready to fight me?
[82:02.04]In like another, maybe one minute.
[82:07.32]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[82:08.30]I think people just helped me with the breakthrough.
[82:17.79]Control?
[82:18.35]Control doesn't do anything.
[82:23.21]doing anything.
[82:23.75]Okay, I gotta bring that out.
[82:24.81]What the fuck?
[82:30.67]Get out there.
[82:35.15]Hold on.
[82:35.92]Turn off snapping.
[82:36.84]Maybe that's like a problem.
[82:44.24]Is this a battle axe?
[82:49.96]Um, I don't know.
[82:53.25]I'm good to go with driving.
[82:54.51]That's for sure.
[83:03.08]Extenders.
[83:03.80]There we go.
[83:04.44]That's what I'm looking for.
[83:05.26]That's what I'm looking for, guys.
[83:08.60]Oh, boy.
[83:09.48]Say your fucking prayers.
[83:10.98]I figured out when you place something...
[83:15.44]Maybe you figured this out.
[83:16.38]When you place something, the double arrows up and down move it.
[83:18.99]You can't place something on top of your robot until it's already been placed on the bottom of it.
[83:25.65]Yeah.
[83:35.00]Well, it was nice knowing you, dude.
[83:44.58]Okay, hold on.
[83:46.18]We don't need any of this anymore.
[83:53.56]Thank you, Leno589.
[83:55.28]Welcome.
[83:58.66]This is going to be fucking awesome.
[84:01.11]Oh, shit.
[84:01.57]No, go back.
[84:02.11]What?
[84:02.51]What the fuck just happened?
[84:09.14]He's not even going to be able to get close, Leno.
[84:10.37]This is going to be fucking amazing.
[84:12.23]You think you have a strategy?
[84:13.37]I have a strategy, too.
[84:14.89]I'm glad we both have strategies.
[84:16.07]Wait, what?
[84:24.89]I'm glad you have a strategy, because mine's probably going to be better than yours.
[84:29.82]Joking Kill, nine months.
[84:31.06]Thanks a lot, Joking Kill.
[84:34.72]Welcome back.
[84:39.30]for nine months in a row with a shower.
[84:43.34]Hey, Trevor, are you ready to go?
[84:46.01]No, I, okay, hold on.
[84:47.81]I had a big breakthrough, so hold on.
[84:54.33]I had a very large breakthrough, so I'm not ready.
[85:23.08]It's not... Hold on.
[85:24.00]It needs to be a little bit lower.
[85:25.10]It needs to be lower.
[85:29.08]What?
[85:29.44]Wait.
[85:31.64]Actually, hold on.
[85:36.51]What?
[85:36.73]What?
[85:39.36]What just happened to my fucking bot?
[85:43.02]What just happened?
[85:48.63]I can't even get... My game's fucked.
[85:51.65]I can't even get out of here.
[85:57.09]Yeah.
[85:58.25]I am no longer ready.
[85:59.91]I have to make my entire robot again.
[86:03.11]I'm stuck in the game and my robot blew up.
[86:08.60]Are you fucking kidding me?
[86:10.23]I have to exit the game.
[86:11.73]I have to Alt F4 the game.
[86:16.89]God damn it.
[86:22.92]Oh, it's starting in a second.
[86:25.76]I definitely didn't save it.
[86:28.98]Shit.
[86:34.70]So my robot blew up on the table and crashed like the game the game broke I had to reach out the whole game Just in case you were curious as to the happenings oh God mute turn the volume down turn the volume guys quick turn the volume down turn your volume down Okay, no, no, thank God.
[86:57.58]It's saved.
[86:58.46]You're good.
[86:58.74]You're safe
[87:01.97]I thought that when you restart the game, it does what some games do and just reverts back all the settings.
[87:05.81]That was insane.
[87:09.19]I'm as ready as I'm ever going to be.
[87:11.08]I don't know if you heard what I was saying to you.
[87:14.82]I'm as ready as I'm ever going to be.
[87:16.38]We should just do this.
[87:18.92]I lost everything.
[87:21.86]My game decided that the robot was not good enough and it blew it up and I couldn't leave the game.
[87:26.15]I win.
[87:27.09]No, you won.
[87:29.83]Sorry, I know exactly what I need to do now.
[87:31.95]And it's going to take me like less than a minute.
[87:33.97]Okay.
[87:34.21]I just need to get like be able to drive the car.
[87:41.06]Might as well work on mine a little bit more.
[87:42.84]Yeah, work on yours.
[87:44.04]You're done for by the way.
[87:46.24]No, I'm not.
[87:48.48]I don't think you understand what my you have a strategy.
[87:51.24]I have a strategy too.
[87:52.14]That's probably a lot better than your strategy.
[87:54.67]We'll just say.
[87:56.97]Well, just say my strategy is better.
[87:59.13]You don't even know.
[87:59.79]I don't think you understand.
[88:01.23]I'm making a shower for you.
[88:05.78]You think you're like a big boy.
[88:07.80]Wait, no.
[88:17.44]I want a fat boy.
[88:29.29]uh this needs to be bigger this actually is kind of like fun just to sit here and do this uh what the hell where is it how is steering wide there we go now those wheels won't bump
[88:58.94]Okay.
[89:00.78]Getting there.
[89:01.22]Alright.
[89:05.45]So now I just have to do this last thing.
[89:07.55]So this is the front, right?
[89:20.55]Okay.
[89:30.88]We're almost done.
[89:37.57]No, it's not going to let me do that.
[89:38.61]So I have to do it like here.
[89:45.35]See, okay.
[89:51.98]There we go.
[89:53.56]Weapons.
[89:55.60]Get them on there.
[90:02.09]good fucking luck now we just need some we need some weight and I'll be good to go put like a couple of fucking weights back here or just like one maybe it'll be like alright give it a test everything we wanted to do today was just a bad idea
[90:33.96]Good fucking luck.
[90:37.72]Hold on.
[90:40.77]Not done.
[90:45.15]I'm having a great old time because you don't understand the fact that you're never going to be able to touch me.
[90:54.87]I saved the bot.
[90:59.45]Now we're getting somewhere.
[91:10.23]Okay, it's going to be Test Bot 2.
[91:12.47]Sure.
[91:18.11]Now we're getting somewhere.
[91:27.01]This is the front, right?
[91:27.89]Okay.
[91:29.31]Accelerate, deaccelerate.
[91:32.29]And steer left, steer right.
[91:34.23]Okay.
[91:36.83]But we're not going to have to worry about steering, guys.
[91:40.22]Not at all.
[91:50.55]I think it's my turn now.
[91:51.75]I think I crashed my game.
[91:53.55]Yeah, it happens.
[91:58.82]Yeah, I can't click on anything.
[92:00.64]Yep.
[92:01.70]Hopefully you saved it.
[92:03.72]I did.
[92:04.00]Give that another try.
[92:08.29]I need another motor.
[92:09.99]Okay, so every time you have a new weapon, you need a new motor for that weapon.
[92:13.99]If you're curious about that.
[92:16.23]Okay.
[92:16.35]What the fuck is that?
[92:21.22]Mechanics, motors...
[92:38.24]I hear you, I hear you giggling.
[92:44.55]Now we just gotta go backwards.
[92:47.11]He's gonna go like this.
[92:48.18]He'll never touch us.
[92:52.88]He will never win.
[92:54.56]Oh shit.
[93:07.69]That's not what I want.
[93:10.21]Okay, well, that's okay.
[93:10.99]We can salvage it.
[93:19.42]We're making one of those straws.
[93:22.80]We used to drink when we were 10 years old.
[93:25.23]Like the silly milk straws.
[93:26.69]Oh, that's part of the design.
[93:35.04]It's part of my Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 rollercoaster design.
[93:40.76]See, he's like, it's gonna be so free.
[93:42.10]I saved mine, but I don't think it is openable anymore.
[93:46.08]Like, I get a preview of it, but then I can't edit anything.
[93:49.23]It's just, like, stuck.
[93:51.31]No, I don't want to fucking tire on it.
[93:52.89]Shit.
[93:53.51]That's okay.
[93:54.23]I'll do the drama and remake the whole thing.
[93:58.87]No, that's too long.
[93:59.59]40 centimeters.
[94:05.84]There we go.
[94:06.74]Perfect.
[94:07.72]Perfect!
[94:31.29]I'm ready!
[94:32.35]Let's go!
[94:33.05]I just need a little bit more weight on the front.
[94:40.68]Oh, this is gonna be great.
[94:41.82]I'm gonna have like two more of these.
[94:43.26]Let's get like a weight here.
[94:50.71]And a weight right here.
[94:52.65]Balance it out.
[94:53.67]Oh, I don't have another- Oh, fuck, I need a wheel.
[95:08.54]Uh, hold on a second.
[95:10.82]The back wheel.
[95:11.90]I know.
[95:12.30]I'll fix it.
[95:12.74]I'll fix it.
[95:13.42]We still have to make, like, our fucking weird slurpy straw ride.
[95:17.64]No, not mechanics.
[95:25.82]Mounts.
[95:27.16]Extenders.
[95:29.53]Now I need another fucking, yeah, motor.
[95:39.70]Mounts, extenders.
[96:10.63]He's going to be so confused.
[96:18.38]One more little connector right here.
[96:19.90]Right there.
[96:24.28]Bang.
[96:25.46]No, no, no.
[96:26.14]That was 80 to 60.
[96:40.33]I'm just making Dr. Octopus.
[96:46.29]Is this going to drive?
[96:47.03]I don't think it's going to be able to... Oh, no, it's stuck on the wheel.
[96:49.11]Hold on.
[96:53.04]Pull it up a little if I can.
[96:54.60]Wait, what?
[97:06.50]That's what I'm saying.
[97:07.21]Like, my whole thing got broken...
[97:11.14]Well, don't worry.
[97:12.90]It's not like it's going to be that big of a deal once you get to see my fucking, my design.
[97:19.46]Thank you to Quack for four months.
[97:31.82]Welcome back, dude.
[97:33.35]Appreciate it.
[97:36.40]I'll get the- I'll get the wheel on there.
[97:37.92]I need to make w- No, that's alright.
[97:39.88]I'm done.
[97:40.36]I'm- Let's go.
[97:41.47]Let's go.
[97:42.23]This is stupid.
[97:43.49]Let's go.
[97:45.19]Let me just make sure it fucking drives.
[97:48.41]I'm not even checking.
[97:50.91]Okay.
[97:52.21]You ready?
[97:54.39]Yeah.
[97:54.83]So... We're going- I saved it.
[97:58.51]We're gonna exit.
[98:00.33]Send me an invite.
[98:01.55]Here we go.
[98:05.31]Online...
[98:12.35]I invite my friend Darren.
[98:16.61]I mean, uh, Radical or whatever your name was.
[98:18.63]Test bot 2.
[98:22.66]I'm gonna try and use the old one, but my game might just crash.
[98:25.40]Well, we'll find out.
[98:30.04]Here we go.
[98:32.62]Are you ready to get fucking destroyed?
[98:34.66]Oh wait, no.
[98:36.91]What are you doing?
[98:38.63]I have to re-invite you.
[98:39.83]Why?
[98:40.90]I made the weight class light.
[98:43.58]Oh.
[98:43.80]Yeah, this thing's probably pretty heavy.
[98:44.68]But I couldn't pick one.
[98:46.44]I just realized that too.
[98:47.25]This thing's probably fucking extremely heavy.
[98:51.35]You invite me again?
[98:55.65]Yeah.
[98:55.89]Get that music cranked up a little bit, you know what I mean?
[98:58.41]You coming?
[98:59.10]I'm joining.
[99:11.39]Joining lobby.
[99:12.02]He says, please wait.
[99:14.52]Select bot?
[99:15.90]Hmm.
[99:16.52]Yeah.
[99:18.48]Let's fucking go.
[99:19.12]I'm ready.
[99:20.84]Alright, let's go.
[99:21.46]Hopefully our game doesn't crash.
[99:23.18]Let's kick his ass.
[99:26.63]Welcome to the field.
[99:29.17]Yep, that's about what we expected here on the Ster stream.
[99:32.09]He just...
[99:39.83]Would you like to come and defeat my robot now?
[99:42.43]I'm coming!
[99:46.28]Alright, let's get him!
[99:51.64]Plus 25 points.
[99:53.92]Doing it.
[99:55.08]I can't move my camera.
[99:58.53]I'm getting points right now.
[100:02.01]Oh, warning, warning, I'm about to win.
[100:07.52]Fuck you, kick his ass.
[100:08.84]I don't even know what you're doing.
[100:15.56]I'm fucking winning.
[100:19.31]I'm winning.
[100:25.41]You're smoking right now.
[100:26.63]Does that mean I'm doing good?
[100:33.36]You're doing great, Guillermo.
[100:41.24]Why are we still doing this?
[100:43.88]Why is this still happening?
[100:46.36]Shouldn't I have killed you, like, five times?
[100:48.30]Do you see the little, like, the lump of turrets in the very center of the field?
[100:55.66]I'm gonna go... Yeah, that's, like, your brain.
[100:57.07]I'm gonna go take that out.
[100:57.93]That's what it locked my point of view on, and I can't move it because it's in the ground, and it's not really connected.
[101:04.39]I think you have to destroy that.
[101:07.25]What, like, your fucking brain?
[101:08.49]You have, like, the bat signal?
[101:12.65]Come on.
[101:13.66]Right there.
[101:14.58]That's his core.
[101:15.50]Look at his core.
[101:19.74]Can you destroy me?
[101:20.66]You only have 30 seconds to beat me.
[101:24.85]Are you trying to tell me that I can't win?
[101:27.03]I can't beat you and you're immovable.
[101:28.81]You're probably gonna win by, like, your, like, boxing.
[101:32.14]Like, you're not getting a knockout.
[101:33.96]No one can knock out my bot.
[101:35.24]Where the fuck is your, like, brain?
[101:36.68]I don't understand.
[101:39.38]Is it, like, over here?
[101:40.26]Hold on, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[101:42.71]My pieces of my robot are scattered everywhere.
[101:47.37]I win.
[101:47.59]Yeah, you got 4,000 points on me.
[101:52.77]Okay.
[101:53.15]You wanna rematch?
[101:53.69]He just fucking exploded.
[101:56.25]Yeah.
[101:56.53]Rematch.
[101:57.53]Alright, rematch.
[102:01.17]That was so funny.
[102:02.65]Wait, did I never save the 2.0 version?
[102:04.87]I came and it just fucking blew up.
[102:12.32]Okay, rematch.
[102:12.94]I still had to fight him.
[102:17.48]Alright.
[102:18.46]What?
[102:19.30]Enter the soccer arena.
[102:20.70]Why are you still here?
[102:22.58]I don't know.
[102:23.72]Why is your link other corpse here?
[102:25.41]And what is this?
[102:27.25]Yeah, why is my destroyed bot still here?
[102:34.69]I don't know.
[102:36.21]Alright, start.
[102:41.52]Can it start?
[102:42.04]Let's go.
[102:42.46]Can you defeat the fucking silly straw?
[102:46.92]This is giving me a headache.
[102:47.96]Did you start it?
[102:48.96]I hit start.
[102:50.50]I hit start?
[102:51.50]I hit start.
[102:54.01]I think it's happening to... What's going on?
[102:56.36]What's that noise?
[102:57.40]What is that noise?
[102:58.22]What's happening?
[103:00.52]Why are we, like, picking up coins?
[103:04.34]Who's picking up, like, fucking Mario coins?
[103:13.38]I guess we're restarting our game.
[103:14.58]What?
[103:14.90]Who's getting hit?
[103:16.86]I think we're playing right now.
[103:18.96]No way.
[103:20.38]This is giving me a headache.
[103:21.73]I'm deleting my game.
[103:24.05]Restart your games.
[103:25.59]I have a headache.
[103:26.05]Somebody's getting hit.
[103:27.83]Somebody's getting hit.
[103:35.25]Oh, I've come out.
[103:37.15]My character came out of, like, spawn.
[103:41.72]He just said 3, 2, 1, start up at the main menu.
[103:44.38]3, 2, 1, start.
[103:44.86]Ugh, my fucking head.
[103:45.64]3, 2, 1, start!
[104:09.90]Okay.
[104:10.66]I'm inviting you again.
[104:11.46]You ready?
[104:11.97]I'm ready.
[104:23.87]I want to like... Okay, don't do the soccer field.
[104:25.81]That seems to be broken.
[104:28.71]I'm... What do you select?
[104:30.79]Yeah.
[104:33.19]Uh... Sub... No.
[104:35.63]Do one with not a whole lot of effects on it, so we don't... Okay, this people here.
[104:39.13]There are people on this one.
[104:40.71]Yeah.
[104:41.21]Mm-hmm.
[104:42.03]That's why you want this one.
[104:43.19]Get this one.
[104:45.31]I have the dildozer.
[104:47.08]The dildozer.
[104:48.60]All opponents are ready.
[104:50.08]Three, two, one, start!
[104:56.88]How do I drive?
[104:58.45]What's happening?
[104:59.87]Oh.
[105:04.05]Oh shit, I'm hitting like the ground.
[105:05.37]Is that like boxing gloves?
[105:11.02]Yeah, come and get me.
[105:15.82]Come and get me.
[105:16.46]Oh shit.
[105:19.62]Yeah, get dildoed.
[105:20.54]You're like punching me in the fucking ass.
[105:24.96]Oh, my right side isn't protected.
[105:26.40]What a mistake.
[105:32.69]Get dildoed.
[105:40.23]Oh yeah, the handicap part.
[105:50.47]Who's winning?
[105:52.09]Did I lose?
[105:55.33]I think you lost.
[105:58.11]I won.
[105:59.92]Now someone's knocking on my door.
[106:01.32]A lot.
[106:02.42]A lot of knocking on my door.
[106:06.62]Oh my god, shut up.
[106:10.04]Okay, ready for round two?
[106:11.56]Round two.
[106:14.90]Oh, that was fucking hilarious.
[106:19.25]I gotta make another bot.
[106:20.63]This bot sucked.
[106:21.73]I'm ready.
[106:23.21]Go.
[106:23.81]I'm ready.
[106:24.85]Start.
[106:26.20]Okay, that's your original design.
[106:28.32]This is your original design.
[106:32.82]Okay, that design does not seem to be really that functional.
[106:44.34]What am I?
[106:44.94]Just rack up the points.
[106:48.23]Get him with the double blades.
[106:51.47]Oh, and there goes a blade.
[106:52.25]There goes one of... I don't know... You just... I can't even hurt you.
[106:55.49]You took off both my... They're still spinning and hitting me.
[106:58.35]Oh, fuck.
[106:58.97]I gotta back into him.
[106:59.95]My whole body is weapon.
[107:01.63]Hold on.
[107:01.93]I got one tiny little piss shit blade on the back.
[107:04.51]I'll get you.
[107:08.27]Yeah, grind him up.
[107:09.83]Oh, shit.
[107:10.40]I have nothing left.
[107:13.66]I don't understand this robot!
[107:17.06]I ran out of things to hurt you with.
[107:18.96]I'm stuck on your saw, I can't drive.
[107:20.48]Okay, guys, we're going for the RAM strategy.
[107:27.41]Motherfucker!
[107:28.77]Oh, I'm getting the robot mute.
[107:33.19]Whoa!
[107:33.53]He's getting blocks!
[107:36.25]He's getting- Oh, nice, I'm getting caught up in my fucking tubes!
[107:39.15]Dude, there was like an a-
[107:46.63]This is so loud.
[107:48.77]I looked away for a second.
[107:50.07]Where are you?
[107:51.31]Turn around.
[107:51.75]Turn around.
[107:56.25]Can you turn around?
[107:57.27]No.
[107:59.43]I can't even like see you.
[108:03.17]I can't see your character.
[108:05.18]He's just gone.
[108:06.38]I just hear you hurting yourself.
[108:09.29]You fucking won by so much.
[108:10.79]Where are you?
[108:11.61]I went in the... I exploded from the sewer explosion.
[108:15.99]14,000 points, I win.
[108:17.01]Alright, we're about going back to the drawing board.
[108:20.79]What?
[108:21.21]We're going back to the drawing board.
[108:22.57]I'm gonna make new... I'm gonna make another one.
[108:25.12]This time I'm gonna make something that is just undeniable.
[108:28.88]Un-fucking-deniable.
[108:31.10]Undeniable?
[108:31.76]Mhm.
[108:34.34]Just do what I did and cheat and get some shit from the workshop.
[108:37.90]Is that what you did?
[108:39.89]Mean the first one I made hold on a minute.
[108:42.85]You tell me you went to like the workshop Do you honestly think and I made the thing that you just fought?
[108:49.78]No, I would assume The workshop but a real dick Okay, I want this to be I made the dildozer that thing looked like symmetrical and intelligent.
[109:04.92]Oh
[109:09.45]Oh.
[109:10.05]Oh, yes.
[109:12.67]I'm going with a more sleek design, guys.
[109:14.75]I already have a high hopes for that.
[109:22.96]Let me... He's not going to be able to fuck with this one.
[109:35.51]I guarantee it.
[109:50.79]I'm making the thing that won the tournament in BattleBots like 10 years ago.
[110:01.85]If I could fucking do anything right.
[110:03.87]Okay, there we go.
[110:07.67]This is not working out the way I wanted.
[110:08.89]Here we go.
[110:09.31]Okay.
[110:09.43]Like that.
[110:20.73]Okay.
[110:22.84]Just got to get some good wheels on it.
[110:26.54]Which connector do you use for the wheels?
[110:28.94]What do you mean?
[110:32.54]You have to put them in the mouth.
[110:33.58]Power steering.
[110:36.10]Power steering.
[110:36.80]Oh.
[110:38.82]What?
[110:39.74]Power steering.
[110:40.76]Under components, mechanics, power steering.
[110:52.95]Power steering.
[110:54.91]I hear you.
[110:56.27]Components, mechanics, power steering.
[110:58.61]Okay.
[111:01.63]My God.
[111:03.77]Geez.
[111:05.33]Hold on.
[111:05.59]This is not the right way.
[111:06.31]I want it to be like that.
[111:10.03]I want this to be the front.
[111:11.23]I'm going to spin it.
[111:14.41]That is the front.
[111:21.37]Can I just spin the whole damn thing?
[111:23.59]Okay, I'm getting somewhere.
[111:26.71]Oh, shit!
[111:27.55]Fuck you, I didn't want to do that!
[111:29.39]Oh, game sucks.
[111:32.66]Well, no, actually, that's okay, because I can redo this thing the way that I wanted.
[111:39.84]Wait, how do you connect those things to, like, a motor?
[111:41.84]You know what, you need a battery.
[111:47.64]What's a battery?
[111:48.52]Battery powers the car.
[111:49.62]God, come on, man, get with the program.
[111:52.08]How do you connect the battery to anything?
[111:54.52]The battery just powers the power steering.
[111:56.72]Anything that's, like, powered.
[111:57.58]But how do you connect the battery to the powered steering?
[111:59.94]You don't have to.
[112:00.34]You just need to... I just can't, like, drive it after it's connected.
[112:04.17]You have to click on it and do, um... Like... Hold on.
[112:08.67]Controls?
[112:09.39]Yes.
[112:09.99]And then you do forward, back, left, right, whatever you want to do.
[112:14.99]Okay.
[112:18.61]This is the front, so I want to spin this.
[112:26.22]Why is my camera... I'm learning.
[112:35.64]You are.
[112:36.20]Good.
[112:36.42]Good.
[112:36.64]I'm learning.
[112:37.20]I'm learning.
[112:52.56]Okay.
[112:53.04]This thing is going to destroy you now that I know how to actually do something.
[112:55.94]I wish I could, like, tell what the fuck, which one I'm grabbing here.
[113:00.28]There we go.
[113:19.38]Whoa, didn't want to do that.
[113:20.52]Didn't want to do that.
[113:21.50]Pull it back.
[113:22.30]Pull it back.
[113:25.08]Like that.
[113:28.14]Ah, now we're getting somewhere.
[113:31.02]Now we're getting somewhere.
[113:32.56]Oh, they decided to play Scrap Mechanic again?
[113:37.41]No, Etalyx is way better than Scrap Mechanic.
[113:46.31]Build... Have you figured out how to do, like, armor?
[113:50.27]Like, how the hell do you, like, put... I don't want just, like, a white plastic piece of shit.
[113:54.45]Your armor just changes the chassis, what it's built out of.
[113:57.53]You can see the mass change at the top.
[113:59.50]I see.
[113:59.96]There's a color something somewhere.
[114:01.94]It was fucking steel.
[114:16.25]This might work.
[114:17.21]This might work very well.
[114:22.01]I'm finally seeing my design come to fruition.
[114:28.00]This is what I wanted the first time.
[114:35.00]But I was foolish.
[114:38.07]I need like fast.
[114:41.29]Is it like street tires?
[114:46.97]This might be an issue, but whatever.
[114:50.71]This is definitely an issue.
[114:55.70]Why would I want a short chainsaw?
[115:04.06]I'm going to mute just so I can tell you my strategy here.
[115:06.97]Alright, guys.
[115:08.61]So he's just going to... I'm going to drive straight at him.
[115:13.30]I just don't understand.
[115:15.06]I'm going to drive straight at this dude and just like BAM!
[115:18.54]He's going to fly up like a ramp and it's going to fucking destroy him.
[115:24.22]I have no idea if there's anything like that.
[115:26.71]I wish there was.
[115:27.21]Is this going to work?
[115:33.03]I need like extenders.
[115:34.69]Oh no, I can do this.
[115:35.41]No, I don't want to do that.
[115:38.99]There we go.
[115:47.68]That's still connected.
[115:48.60]It should work.
[115:51.10]I hope so.
[115:57.42]This needs to just come down a little.
[116:01.33]Oh, that's wrong.
[116:10.87]Can I not bring it all the way down?
[116:11.87]I guess I can.
[116:18.39]I'm just like a giant snow shovel.
[116:23.19]That's going to be too awkward like that.
[116:25.37]I'm going to put some weights on it too.
[116:32.95]Actually, can I?
[116:33.65]I don't know if that's not low enough.
[116:43.84]It might just scrape off the ground though.
[116:45.46]That's a good thing.
[116:48.48]Let me get some fucking power on this thing.
[116:50.10]Let's power this thing the fuck up.
[117:05.97]Okay.
[117:07.93]I don't know if this is connected.
[117:09.13]I hope it is.
[117:09.81]Extenders.
[117:17.66]Can I stick these wheels out?
[117:21.11]Yes, I can.
[117:23.51]Perfect.
[117:24.65]Perfect.
[117:25.97]This is going to be perfect.
[117:29.71]Too much.
[117:31.54]Let's do 80.
[117:37.36]80.
[117:39.74]Got a couple of wheels on there.
[117:56.79]No, theoretically.
[117:57.81]I should be able just to extend them, right?
[118:06.97]Need another one.
[118:07.65]Another one.
[118:12.00]And another one.
[118:14.22]Okay.
[118:16.10]Let's see if that works.
[118:26.91]Just need to see if this thing stands.
[118:29.69]That's all I care about at the moment.
[118:34.93]It does.
[118:38.95]Now, I'm going to put a couple weights here.
[118:41.93]Oh, baby.
[118:48.37]I'm going to be in the money soon enough.
[118:53.21]Needs more snow shovel.
[118:56.93]It does.
[119:03.76]I'm ready.
[119:04.24]Let's go.
[119:04.68]I worked so hard on mine, and it broke.
[119:10.62]Hold on now.
[119:11.20]Don't be so hasty.
[119:32.82]A couple more.
[119:33.76]A couple more and we'll be ready.
[119:40.88]And I'm going to cover it.
[119:42.60]Oh, it's going to be great.
[119:58.90]Now, the most important thing, guys...
[120:04.49]Let's get some components.
[120:05.55]Let's get some mounts.
[120:06.89]Let's get like a couple of these.
[120:36.57]No, that's too steep.
[120:45.92]I don't know how to activate them, but I'll try.
[120:47.78]I'm going to just put horns all over it.
[120:52.03]No!
[120:52.99]What?
[120:55.23]Did you break it again?
[120:58.50]Stealing my idea.
[121:00.10]What are we talking about?
[121:01.50]Are we both adding horns to our... This is going to be the most obnoxious fight ever.
[121:10.95]God damn it.
[121:19.52]Click the snap button, please.
[121:20.82]I was going to say there has to be something like that.
[121:30.11]Snap just moves it up in increments.
[121:35.12]This is so dumb.
[121:36.74]I don't know how to even activate this.
[121:38.32]It's not actually snapping to anything.
[121:50.03]I want you to know it's, you know, like... These are like lamps.
[122:00.82]Alright.
[122:02.08]Let's make sure I can drive.
[122:03.48]No, no, no.
[122:08.92]I don't want to do that.
[122:10.04]Save it.
[122:10.86]Test 3.
[122:11.32]Which one of these gumdrops do I want?
[122:31.70]Oh, yeah.
[122:32.54]Hold on.
[122:33.26]Not done.
[122:35.04]Not done.
[122:41.97]This is fun.
[122:42.71]This is gonna be fun.
[122:45.41]Can we just start soon?
[122:47.19]No, we can't.
[122:48.09]This is important.
[122:49.11]My guy has to have a face.
[122:52.01]Well, I guess I have time to add... You have time.
[122:56.52]...things.
[123:00.79]He's getting... That's absolutely what he's getting.
[123:02.99]Eager oatmeal.
[123:05.51]Oh, shit.
[123:05.87]I think I missed... MLG Kevin, thank you for two months.
[123:08.02]I missed you, dude.
[123:08.62]I didn't even... I was too locked in.
[123:11.74]But welcome, dude.
[123:14.86]Battery low.
[123:16.02]Morale low.
[123:18.31]Don't worry.
[123:18.59]There's gonna be like four batteries on this fucking thing.
[123:20.61]It's not working.
[123:31.04]Why isn't it working?
[123:33.98]What's not working?
[123:35.68]Anything.
[123:37.56]Like nothing.
[123:38.76]Anything.
[123:46.86]I have power.
[123:52.06]I probably need air.
[123:53.22]Oh, I probably do.
[124:07.41]Oh, no, wait, that's the wrong side.
[124:09.50]How do I rotate this, like, up?
[124:12.50]You can totally do that.
[124:22.77]Wait, did I have it?
[124:23.83]No, what?
[124:38.03]Oh, this is great.
[124:40.21]Well, I'm just going to make it controls.
[124:46.17]Oh, whoops.
[124:46.53]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[124:54.31]Okay.
[124:54.67]Glad that's settled.
[124:56.63]Let's test it.
[125:03.55]Fuck.
[125:03.69]Still not heavy enough.
[125:11.40]What's the issue here?
[125:14.00]Oh, hold on.
[125:16.45]It's taking so much of my brain power.
[125:20.23]Where was the power steering?
[125:21.65]Components.
[125:24.59]Components.
[125:27.99]Nelothoa!
[125:28.85]Thank you, Nelothoa.
[125:29.85]Welcome.
[125:33.53]Thank you for your subscription.
[125:43.83]I don't want it sticking out that far.
[125:44.99]Here we go.
[125:51.81]We're paying in the ass.
[125:57.28]Bigger wheels.
[126:00.18]I'm going to make the big wheels in the back, little wheels in the front.
[126:05.34]That makes sense, right?
[126:10.06]How do you activate the horns?
[126:16.06]We just need to go.
[126:19.88]We've been doing this for like an hour.
[126:21.58]I'm like enjoying this right now.
[126:28.18]I don't know that anyone watching my stream is though.
[126:31.93]I guess so.
[126:32.43]They're still here.
[126:33.33]I'm surprised.
[126:41.99]We will wait.
[126:55.54]How do you do paint?
[126:56.80]Where's paint again?
[127:02.35]I have no idea.
[127:04.01]It's just on the main.
[127:19.44]Say thanks, HappyPants.
[127:21.58]Wait, what?
[127:24.60]What the fuck?
[127:26.22]What did I do?
[127:26.60]What's going on?
[127:27.02]What did I do wrong?
[127:32.10]The back, are these just not touching?
[127:33.52]Yeah, they're not touching.
[127:34.40]Okay, well then I get it.
[127:36.57]We're going to have to do back.
[127:37.47]We're going to have to do rear wheel drive.
[127:39.13]These aren't...
[127:54.61]I can't, like, turn these sideways to put on the side.
[127:57.93]Normally, before, I could.
[127:59.01]I need more batteries.
[128:04.20]I need more fucking batteries?
[128:05.34]God damn it.
[128:09.58]4K!
[128:11.00]Is it this battery right there?
[128:33.74]Need more batteries?
[128:34.96]What did I do wrong?
[128:39.96]So this battery is connected, right?
[128:41.30]I don't know.
[128:43.71]I... I thought it was.
[128:48.27]Power 2,400 volts, dude.
[128:49.77]That's a lot of volts.
[128:50.83]I'm, like, done with this.
[128:51.95]This is all I wanted.
[128:53.20]This was what the joke was when I made it.
[129:01.07]What, are they not connected?
[129:02.67]Now before just using the mouse would rotate things.
[129:06.22]Control does nothing.
[129:07.72]As much as everyone kept telling me to use control, I have not found a use for it yet.
[129:12.24]I haven't been paying attention to anything it's been saying.
[129:20.63]They're just barely turning.
[129:22.25]God damn.
[129:38.24]There's a build time specified.
[129:41.04]We specified a build time.
[129:42.54]Do we did?
[129:43.14]Exceeded the limit.
[129:44.42]Hold on.
[129:44.74]There we go.
[129:54.97]I got a fucking shitload of motors now.
[129:59.11]Delete the second battery?
[130:00.21]I don't think that's what the problem is.
[130:03.49]Nah, I can't.
[130:03.91]Nothing's even touching.
[130:08.78]Jerma, the battery is touching the goddamn floor.
[130:10.63]I know, the battery, the battery, the battery, the battery.
[130:15.63]Let's get a bunch of fucking little batteries then.
[130:17.49]I'm actually not touching the floor.
[130:23.68]These ones aren't touching the floor.
[130:34.66]Battery low, pull up battery.
[130:36.68]I don't understand.
[130:43.76]Supercharge!
[130:44.90]Jerma, Jerma, Jerma, Jerma.
[130:47.84]What?
[130:48.14]How do you rotate something to the side and put it on the side of your robot?
[130:52.86]Because it's not... Before I could... I'm missing something, though.
[130:59.52]I figured it out, never mind.
[131:00.82]I'm a genius.
[131:03.82]I had this one, like, key component that I'm, like, forgetting to do for some reason.
[131:07.33]Okay.
[131:10.03]Are you sure about the batteries?
[131:13.19]Thanks for celebrating stream.
[131:14.13]Thanks for celebrating stream.
[131:18.49]I swear before, I could just rotate them with the mouse.
[131:21.23]I'm gonna have to do big wheels in the front, too.
[131:22.53]No one's gonna believe me.
[131:23.55]Streamer's dumb.
[131:24.26]Streamer's dumb.
[131:29.14]It's too heavy.
[131:30.18]No, it can't be too heavy.
[131:35.34]Alright, I'm going to take off some of these then.
[131:38.28]I'm just curious.
[131:39.86]If I can get it to touch the ground, it would be perfect.
[131:41.62]Have you guys seen how dumb this streamer is?
[131:46.43]Which one?
[131:46.81]You or both of us?
[131:48.79]Both of us.
[131:50.47]Oh, yeah.
[131:53.93]That would have been done with my robot already, but the streamer is dumb.
[131:57.98]If I can just get this to touch the damn ground.
[132:02.44]Can I, like, lower this?
[132:03.48]Will it, like, actually help me here?
[132:06.50]I wonder if I can just, like, dig it down here like that.
[132:10.96]Let's see what that does.
[132:16.62]Oh, progress.
[132:20.19]We're getting progress.
[132:41.41]It goes in a circle.
[132:43.67]It lives.
[132:44.37]Two tons.
[132:49.67]Well, what am I supposed to do?
[132:52.11]I need it to be this big.
[132:53.27]It has to be this big and, like, annoying.
[132:55.03]Alright, we're doing fucking... I don't even give a fuck anymore.
[133:04.49]Let's try this.
[133:09.61]Shit!
[133:19.13]The eyes are touching the ground.
[133:20.53]Alright.
[133:30.50]Components.
[133:32.64]So much power.
[133:38.41]Get rid of the needless... Did you just say the needless horns?
[133:41.05]I just want to make sure you understand what you just said there.
[133:47.48]I... Moments ago, my robot worked.
[133:51.94]I clicked test and everything flew off of it.
[133:58.21]Large CO2 tank.
[133:59.75]We're just gonna have to go with fucking straight up CO2.
[134:08.77]We just need pure noxious gas to be able to move this thing.
[134:26.36]Okay.
[134:28.44]Controls.
[134:29.31]It's completely broken.
[134:30.75]I can't do anything again.
[134:32.65]You fucked it up?
[134:34.65]Yeah.
[134:36.11]I tested it.
[134:37.01]It worked.
[134:37.65]I added a couple of things.
[134:40.27]I tested it and it all exploded.
[134:42.83]I think my thing just weighs too much.
[134:45.53]I have no idea.
[134:46.21]Can we just please, please, for the love of God, like, go?
[134:49.51]You've been doing this for too long.
[134:51.53]Well, yours doesn't work either, so mine doesn't work either.
[134:54.11]Let's go!
[134:54.63]It's not gonna work!
[134:56.48]It's gonna work, we just go!
[134:57.76]Hold on, I need to make, hold on a second.
[134:59.94]One more second.
[135:02.84]How do I make this so I can, like, activate them?
[135:06.38]I can't remove the things I added, because now as soon as I open it and test, it breaks.
[135:14.99]So it's gonna be one of those again, where you just break.
[135:21.77]I don't get it.
[135:22.42]Like, there's nothing to press on this screen.
[135:28.86]It looks like it's together, though.
[135:30.26]I... Please, Jerome.
[135:32.82]Please.
[135:33.66]Alright, let's just go.
[135:34.72]Fine.
[135:38.70]move the hell Jerma his batteries are dragging on the ground everyone people have given me money to tell you this it doesn't matter I've raised them I've raised them like they were my own okay I'll do it much oh they're they're not touching the ground look this stuffed in here I'm gonna go all the way up with them and my noxious gas I'm gonna fucking delete these things these things are useless
[136:15.37]Jerma, I'm waiting for you.
[136:17.43]He's got like all these batteries in his face.
[136:20.11]Alright, I'm just gonna save it.
[136:21.03]Whatever happens, happens.
[136:22.65]Let's go.
[136:25.61]I think someone just bet on me.
[136:28.12]Alright, add me.
[136:30.88]If only Jerma took the tips that someone could have told him the batteries were... No, it's definitely the chassis material.
[136:38.10]I'm just gonna make it plastic.
[136:39.92]That's right.
[136:40.66]I don't even have it.
[136:42.56]I can do that real quick.
[136:43.59]Hold on.
[136:54.84]There, it's made out of fucking cardboard.
[136:56.42]Alright, I'm ready.
[137:09.37]I'm coming in.
[137:17.17]You ready?
[137:19.17]Let's do it.
[137:20.49]Robot arena.
[137:21.97]Robot arena.
[137:22.69]Mhm.
[137:26.98]I hope mine works.
[137:28.69]I hope it doesn't explode.
[137:30.07]Everybody's talking shit about me.
[137:35.89]You haven't made a working fucking robot this whole time.
[137:39.21]Why?
[137:39.96]And you broke everything.
[137:43.02]Everyone yells at me, but at least I have a fucking functioning robot that doesn't explode.
[137:47.36]Come on.
[137:51.34]I think I lowered my tires too much they're in the ground but I can't edit my robot anymore like seriously at least my guy like didn't explode yeah see I can the game's crashing I can't even see driving so it must be I can't even the game you have locked up this whole game
[138:18.48]I'm gone.
[138:19.16]Micah, I'm gone.
[138:20.15]I'm gone.
[138:20.43]Yeah, I can do it.
[138:21.41]Yeah.
[138:23.87]Alright, let's try again.
[138:25.05]Oh my god, dude.
[138:26.09]What the fuck?
[138:27.81]I've spent so much time on that for me to... I can't even edit it anymore.
[138:34.97]I can't... I know what's wrong and I can't go in and fix it.
[138:44.12]Oh god.
[138:44.90]That's...
[138:49.49]That's why I was saying, please, let's go.
[138:51.49]I knew that was happening.
[138:53.78]Every time.
[138:57.14]Every time it just fucking explodes.
[139:03.62]I'm joining.
[139:04.18]I'm ready.
[139:10.26]Have you figured out how to work the horns?
[139:12.22]Yeah, here's my fucking truck.
[139:14.78]You didn't make that.
[139:16.08]I didn't make it.
[139:16.98]You didn't make this.
[139:18.12]It didn't instantly explode.
[139:19.76]Not fucking fair.
[139:20.64]You didn't make it.
[139:23.02]I don't know the buttons to drive.
[139:24.36]Is this... Wait, what?
[139:28.71]I can't... Oh.
[139:29.83]Oh!
[139:30.51]Whoa!
[139:31.25]I didn't put... Okay, I know what I did wrong.
[139:35.68]Do something!
[139:36.06]Move me!
[139:36.34]Move me!
[139:36.60]Move me!
[139:36.94]Move me!
[139:37.24]Quick!
[139:38.20]Move me!
[139:38.92]Move me!
[139:39.70]I'm getting a warning.
[139:42.92]I win.
[139:47.52]You didn't even make that one.
[139:48.60]It's not fair.
[139:50.12]Dude, if I used one that I made... Alright, I'm going to the Steam Workshop.
[139:58.31]How do you... Where'd you get it?
[140:00.67]No.
[140:00.99]No.
[140:01.49]No.
[140:02.21]Just click Workshop on the main menu.
[140:03.71]I'm getting this to fucking work.
[140:10.06]I've... Hey, what was this one?
[140:16.38]Okay, no, this is another one that's broken.
[140:21.29]Holy shit, wait, I can actually edit this one.
[140:23.57]So, fix it!
[140:24.83]Wait, no.
[140:26.49]That one is unredeemed.
[140:27.11]Fucking dumb horn.
[140:27.93]Get these stupid fucking horns off.
[140:29.33]This one... Yeah, what the fuck?
[140:31.31]The horns were the fucking variable here.
[140:35.94]Horns were the variable.
[140:38.40]They're gone.
[140:44.73]It's placing all of the objects that have been placed on my robot in the same spot.
[140:51.85]All inside the middle of it.
[140:56.09]Wait, what?
[141:01.36]There's just a whole bunch of random objects in the middle of my robot.
[141:08.50]Hold on a second.
[141:09.28]Hold on.
[141:09.70]Hold on.
[141:10.06]Hold on.
[141:13.43]Like, every single horn is here.
[141:16.73]Or is it?
[141:17.73]I don't know.
[141:18.23]I can't move anything.
[141:21.57]I didn't do this.
[141:22.17]You broke the game.
[141:29.55]I saved it by accident.
[141:34.06]Okay.
[141:34.88]That's cool.
[141:36.40]I spent a lot of time on that.
[141:42.05]A skull workshop.
[141:43.40]Oh, that's too big.
[141:52.22]No, that's too wide.
[142:02.95]I'm making it like a spider.
[142:06.75]I have so many questions.
[142:10.64]I missed a couple of subscribers.
[142:12.33]FireAntTV, thank you for four months.
[142:14.15]And Ratty, thank you for five months.
[142:16.01]Both of you guys, welcome back.
[142:17.77]And YourCutie says, Mr. Deluge, thank you, Mr. Deluge, for two months.

[142:43.53]I'm either done or you're ready.
[142:46.35]Alright.
[142:46.65]Okay, let's go.
[142:49.86]You're not having fun building robots?
[142:52.36]Not when they fucking implode after I spend 30 minutes on them.
[142:57.72]Alright, invite me.
[143:04.78]See, what we should have done is before streaming, we should have made like three each, but we didn't do that.
[143:10.59]We did not do that.
[143:19.08]Yes, I agree.
[143:19.66]The funniest part of the stream is that there are people watching.
[143:30.17]going with this one oh my stream and your stream combined yeah this game will never have this many viewers ever again dude this is like fun cigarette spaghetti tits oh that's not oh no I'm doing the I'm doing the

[144:21.32]That's no fair.
[144:23.30]That is no fucking fair.
[144:24.60]Why can't we build that shit?
[144:27.32]Come get some.
[144:31.38]Alright, fine.
[144:31.76]I'll get some.
[144:33.62]Back him up.
[144:35.15]Back me into the subway car.
[144:36.83]Am I already dead?
[144:39.51]What the fuck?
[144:41.53]I can't see it.
[144:48.67]I can't.
[144:52.58]You still won.
[144:55.42]How did you still win?
[144:56.58]No, no, no.
[144:57.49]You win.
[144:58.65]No.
[144:59.55]And I'm eliminated.
[145:00.81]You're the winner because I got hit by a train.
[145:02.85]Alright.
[145:03.39]Let's go.
[145:07.67]Wheels too low.
[145:13.86]We're back on the train level.
[145:15.54]All opponents are ready.
[145:17.02]Three, two, one, start.
[145:21.42]Okay, this thing is fucking actually pretty damn cool.
[145:26.40]Well, you have the most boring fucking vehicle I've ever seen.
[145:29.57]You just have a wooden truck.
[145:31.09]But the axe on my back keeps like... I'm not supposed to lift you.
[145:40.26]I lose.
[145:40.98]Nope, I win.
[145:44.36]I'm just a truck.
[145:46.06]I can't fucking lift you like this.
[145:52.53]Oh, there goes my arms.
[145:55.55]This is a... pit fight.
[145:58.21]Yeah, this fight sucks.
[145:59.01]We're both shit characters.
[146:01.43]Come fight me down here.
[146:03.65]Come fight me in the fucking train tracks.
[146:06.13]I'm... I'm done for.
[146:09.47]I didn't see... what?
[146:11.63]Hey, I made that wooden truck.
[146:13.07]It's a good truck, but it's not... it's not a real death machine.
[146:17.23]Alright, this time you're fighting me down.
[146:18.41]We're doing the classic BattleBot and I'm going with my strongest one.
[146:21.89]I actually am going with my strongest one.
[146:24.44]I'm gonna try the HypnoDisc.
[146:27.72]I'm going with my original character.
[146:30.74]This is the real BattleBots Arena.
[146:33.08]This really is the BattleBots Arena.
[146:34.20]Where are you?
[146:45.81]Oh, you're the pizza cutter.
[146:47.85]I am so tiny.
[146:48.85]Yeah, I can't even see you.
[147:08.59]You just got dropped out of the trap door.
[147:13.23]I'm so glad that, like, I'm, like, having a good time.
[147:17.63]You, you, all of your robots have not functioned, except the ones that you've pulled off the Steam Workshop.
[147:24.25]Let's go.
[147:24.55]I'm ready.
[147:26.69]You're not having a good time.
[147:31.38]Oh, look at this level.
[147:34.64]I sound like I'm already dead.
[147:36.62]Good story, Lott.
[147:42.67]What is happening?
[147:43.35]Start!
[147:44.80]I'm gonna come find you.
[147:48.16]I'm just gonna go to the trailer to- What?!
[147:56.26]Ow, my stomach!
[147:58.54]I'm driving around!
[148:01.50]Wait!
[148:02.82]Wait, look at the- I can't!
[148:06.08]I'm driving!
[148:06.66]I can't look around!
[148:17.39]You said, wait, what?
[148:19.67]And then it went, wait, what?
[148:22.88]Let's go.
[148:25.36]Let's go.
[148:25.76]Wait, what?
[148:27.88]Wait, what?
[148:31.48]That's what I find the funniest in all things.
[148:35.07]Oh, I won?
[148:36.31]Yes, I fucking fell right through the trap.
[148:39.82]Oh.
[148:40.22]Before we even started?
[148:42.70]Thank you, Duangtan, for three months.
[148:46.02]No, okay, just don't... Here he comes.
[148:52.04]Here comes the truck.
[148:58.27]That one looks like a good fucking car.
[149:02.03]This thing is too fast.
[149:03.43]Come get me.
[149:05.10]Come attack me.
[149:06.80]Come get me!
[149:15.11]Seriously, I'm just a mouse.
[149:16.49]You're just... This is by far the best thing, by the way.
[149:23.50]What a fucking cartoon we're both doing right now.
[149:27.42]You're back here.
[149:28.98]Oh, he got me.
[149:32.01]What's the purpose of this thing?
[149:33.92]It doesn't do anything.
[149:40.26]Great, I'm on my back.
[149:41.54]Now you can just hit me right in the nuts with a hammer.
[149:47.14]Nothing is happening.
[149:51.54]Yeah, I love this cartoon.
[150:03.48]The Sledgehammer Jeep versus the Roomba.
[150:06.10]I think there's only one more I haven't tried that I got.
[150:13.18]This is fucking amazing.
[150:16.58]The disco floor.
[150:17.35]Hold on.
[150:17.67]What are the only other words of dialog this guy's had?
[150:33.18]I'm quick.
[150:34.42]You and your fucking ship steering wheel.
[150:37.18]This thing's so fast.
[150:42.74]I like these other views.
[150:43.82]They're so much better.
[150:44.62]Alright, what happens when Blade goes against Blade?
[150:48.38]What do you think?
[150:48.76]I don't know.
[150:52.58]Apparently your Blade's a little low and mine's a little too high, so you're gonna win.
[151:04.68]No!
[151:06.84]You're just dead.
[151:07.82]I can't even fucking hit you.
[151:09.18]I can't hit you.
[151:10.16]You're too low.
[151:12.78]Wait a minute.
[151:13.14]Now it's low.
[151:16.15]I win.
[151:18.05]Was that satisfactory?
[151:21.17]Let's do one more.
[151:24.07]For real doe, thank you.
[151:25.79]For real doe 25, welcome back to three months.
[151:28.47]Thank you so much.
[151:29.00]I'm going with my strongest and I'm going on the best map.
[151:31.20]Listen to me, son.
[151:33.54]I'm your dad.
[151:35.48]And then Papa John.
[151:40.26]Destroy him!
[151:40.96]Papa John 6969.
[151:41.58]Thank you, dude.
[151:42.18]Welcome.
[151:42.80]Welcome to the Cyber Dynamo Robotics Facility.
[151:47.33]All opponents are ready.
[151:48.67]Three, two, one.
[151:49.07]I'm laughing at your crane arm.
[151:51.70]That's how I was going with my best and you went with like the sprinkler.
[151:55.42]Dude, just wait till this thing whips around and fucking smashes.
[152:01.42]I lose.
[152:04.92]Nope, I'm good.
[152:09.88]I gotta get like some centrifugal force here.
[152:13.42]We're going for a fucking clothesline.
[152:19.86]How is anyone ever supposed to fight this?
[152:23.86]There's no way.
[152:24.26]That's the perfect bot.
[152:25.45]It's perfect.
[152:26.07]It is the perfect battle bot.
[152:28.51]It just has bear claws that spin at 100 miles per hour.
[152:31.85]The only problem is that it can't actually drive in a straight line.
[152:37.35]I can't even fucking hit you.
[152:38.37]I'd lose.
[152:39.61]Yeah.
[152:41.24]I can't imagine you getting anything that can beat this.
[152:43.94]Hold on.
[152:47.02]I cannot conceive of a bot that will beat it.
[152:51.49]Oh yeah?
[152:53.07]Let's go.
[152:57.29]The showerhead robot.
[152:59.25]All opponents are ready.
[153:00.40]That's not gonna beat it!
[153:01.68]You don't think that's gonna beat it?
[153:03.36]Okay.
[153:03.80]Start!
[153:05.96]That's real cute of you to think that.
[153:07.20]Not gonna beat it, huh?
[153:15.99]Ooh, somebody's getting what they call fucked up!
[153:20.67]What?! !
[153:29.09]That's not how physics work!
[153:31.51]I did it!
[153:31.91]See how I was stuck in the wall?
[153:34.75]Oh shit, I'm getting a mobility warning.
[153:37.48]Put mine start at first.
[153:40.08]You win.
[153:43.42]I won?
[153:45.10]I won a rematch.
[153:46.56]Oh, you won a rematch, huh?
[153:47.78]I won a rematch.
[153:48.66]Well, you got what we call fucking destroyed.
[153:51.27]I can't conceive of a bot that will beat me.
[153:54.35]Mhm.
[153:57.47]All opponents are ready.
[153:58.89]The perfect bot.
[154:01.01]It's just a mess.
[154:02.65]So you end up hurting yourself.
[154:04.30]No, I was taking it easy on you in the beginning.
[154:06.34]Oh, go ahead.
[154:06.64]Take it easy on me.
[154:08.72]What just happened?
[154:10.06]Keep going.
[154:10.60]Take it easy on me, buddy.
[154:12.32]Hey, what's that?
[154:13.46]Oh, I can take it easy.
[154:14.59]Somebody's immobile right now.
[154:16.09]It's too bad.
[154:17.91]Something happened there.
[154:18.77]I'm not sure what.
[154:20.79]I'm going to circle around and do my victory lap.
[154:22.93]He left again.
[154:23.55]I win.
[154:28.61]Did you just quit the whole game?
[154:32.93]He's gone.
[154:41.25]I cannot think of a conceivable bot.
[154:44.81]You got one hit KO'd.
[154:46.23]I love it as a career.
[154:55.28]Okay, I will say this.
[154:57.27]with a little time and like actually figuring out the whole game and like knowing what is what yeah this would be pretty fun especially if you could have more than two people in a match well you can hold on you ended your stream yeah it was part of it it was pretty funny
[155:23.50]I mean, I'm done playing, and I'm... The original plan was to host you anyway.
[155:30.33]I don't know.
[155:31.15]What else do I have ready to do?
[155:32.97]I don't know.
[155:33.45]If you wanted to play something else... I'm... I'm curious.
[155:39.11]Hold on.
[155:41.83]I want to see.
[155:49.05]No, I'm like opening a web page right now.
[155:55.42]I can't believe you.
[155:57.02]Like, I can't even explain how two times in a row it flips me to the ceiling and I land upside down from your, like, tentacle bot.
[156:08.97]Yeah, you know, I'll play some GTA.
[156:10.69]That's a good idea, just to mess around and play some GTA.
[156:15.33]I feel like this would be not a fun thing to do by myself.
[156:18.28]Oh, I finished installing GTA 5.
[156:20.18]You want to play it?
[156:22.68]We could do the races.
[156:24.38]We could.
[156:25.88]We could play GTA 5.
[156:26.90]Alright, so let's give a consensus on the two mystery games we played today, though.
[156:36.81]Necropolis?
[156:38.55]Meh.
[156:41.59]Robot Arena 3?
[156:44.65]It gets a thumbs up.
[156:45.89]I don't know if it's two thumbs up, but it gets a thumbs up for if you actually cared to learn how to play it.
[156:52.07]That's a pretty, you know, whatever.
[156:53.17]There you go.
[156:54.71]What about you?
[156:58.33]Necropolis.
[157:00.76]I've looked forward to that game for like a year at least.
[157:04.46]Wow.
[157:06.06]I was very excited about it when they announced it.
[157:09.50]I'm glad that it took me 20 minutes to hate it.
[157:13.12]So you had more fun in Robot Arena 3, is what you're saying?
[157:17.46]Yes.
[157:18.22]Okay, good.
[157:21.79]Very good.
[157:24.85]So you have GTA, though?
[157:26.93]Yes.
[157:29.33]That sounds like fun.
[157:30.75]Just let me go through like 10 loading screens.
[157:35.31]That's what I plan on doing as well.
[157:49.72]I gotta change my stream title to playing GTA.
[157:58.34]Grand.
[157:58.68]You must finish the prologue from Grand Theft Auto before you can... Have you not done it yet?
[158:06.97]I have, but I uninstalled the game.
[158:09.29]Oh.
[158:09.69]No, that didn't matter for me.
[158:14.67]Do I have to, like, log in?
[158:17.95]How would I even do that?
[158:18.87]Log in with your social club, man.
[158:26.94]GTA or is it Grand Theft Auto 5?
[158:29.20]There we go.
[158:32.28]Apparently I'm logged in and I have you on my friends list.
[158:36.12]So this is my account.
[158:38.81]But I apparently have not beaten the prologue to GTA.
[158:42.71]Wait, you mean you're talking about the actual storyline of GTA?
[158:44.95]Yeah, the story.
[158:45.75]It won't let me on GTA Online until I beat the very first part of the... How have you not played the story in GTA?
[158:52.74]I have.
[158:57.80]Oh, man.
[159:01.25]Are you hosting me right now?
[159:02.81]Yeah.
[159:03.17]Oh, damn.
[159:06.77]Hey, what's up Star viewers?
[159:07.79]What's going on?
[159:08.87]Nice to meet you guys.
[159:10.06]Nice to see you.
[159:11.60]Gonna be chilling here.
[159:14.66]Playing some Grand Theft Auto.
[159:26.83]Is this the first time you and I have played GTA 5 together in like a year and a half?
[159:32.24]Well, I mean, I'll play with you in like 15 minutes when I beat the intro.
[159:36.72]So what?
[159:37.02]I'll just walk around and start punching people and throwing grenades and stuff.
[159:46.47]When you live in a glass house.
[159:47.83]I forgot that.
[159:49.51]What a funny fucking thing we did.
[159:54.49]Hey, do you remember every time we tried to battle, my robots exploded?
[159:58.77]No, that was actually very funny.
[160:06.54]You're talking about something that was quite humorous, actually.
[160:08.88]Let's have some more wine.
[160:20.44]What's this?
[160:20.74]Is this wine?
[160:22.00]Oh, yes.
[160:28.38]Sounds like a plant.
[160:30.87]That's good stuff.
[160:38.21]There's a red wine suit.
[160:39.43]No, I'm wearing like a white wine suit.
[160:41.47]Champagne.
[160:41.93]Alright, let me know when you're ready.
[160:46.91]I'm just gonna go fight people on the street.
[160:51.94]You know?
[160:59.28]So, we just have to be in a party, right?
[161:05.20]Challenge started.
[161:06.02]Fly under the most...
[161:09.31]Why does this always happen to me?
[161:11.25]They push me so far.
[161:12.35]Well, now you... Lady, you're fucked.
[161:17.01]Please.
[161:17.55]No.
[161:17.99]I can't let you get away with... She's gonna get away.
[161:30.34]Damn it!
[161:33.58]Oh my god.
[161:34.32]She's actually... Actually got away.
[161:35.98]She got away.
[161:37.78]I can't believe that.
[161:41.28]Well, that's okay.
[161:46.86]Listen to me, son.
[161:49.37]I'm your dad.
[161:51.81]Destroy him!
[161:55.23]Whoa!
[161:56.35]Albean1.
[161:57.23]What's going on, Albean?
[161:59.31]Thanks a lot.
[162:00.27]What's the button to get in cover?
[162:03.76]Right bumper?
[162:04.84]Left bumper?
[162:05.34]Right bumper?
[162:06.56]Guy's using a controller.
[162:09.43]Just play this on PS4 then.
[162:11.94]This game's more fun with a controller.
[162:17.04]And then Zemp TP back to back.
[162:18.54]Thanks guys.
[162:18.94]Welcome.
[162:19.92]The two of yous.
[162:22.48]Use a grenade on a fleeing car.
[162:23.68]Actually, I didn't use a grenade on a fleeing car.
[162:25.91]I pulled it out and I looked at it and I put it back.
[162:30.29]Where is everybody?
[162:30.89]Is that you?
[162:36.33]That's not you.
[162:36.87]You're not enlisted diabetes.
[162:39.67]No, I am playing as the single player.
[162:42.21]Is this guy on my friends list?
[162:47.75]Oh, dude!
[162:49.13]Sick peel out, man.
[162:55.20]This is a sick car, too.
[162:56.88]This guy knows what he's doing.
[163:04.80]Alright, okay, place your bets.
[163:06.58]Am I going to jump out of the car when it's at full speed?
[163:09.56]I mean, probably.
[163:14.89]Let's fly into some bridges.
[163:16.81]Who the fuck is this?
[163:17.81]There's a guy with a helicopter behind us now.
[163:20.35]Oh, you lost it.
[163:22.99]You lost it.
[163:23.97]I'm going to get in the helicopter.
[163:25.11]And by the way, I'm fucking live.
[163:28.95]This guy sucks.
[163:34.02]Oh, here's another guy.
[163:38.32]This TV's back here?
[163:39.28]I'm like a CEO.
[163:40.42]Does he have a cop costume?
[163:52.37]Alright, now what?
[163:55.97]Why is this open?
[163:58.47]It's just open.
[164:01.47]Go first person.
[164:09.69]Oh, yes.
[164:10.66]Oh, yes.
[164:11.90]My chauffeur will be taking me to a nice club.
[164:15.84]What's this?
[164:16.26]Oh, some champagne.
[164:18.48]Ah, yes, my good man.
[164:20.76]Smells like oak.
[164:25.05]Ah, carry on, my friend.
[164:26.33]Let's watch some TV.
[164:32.13]What's out here?
[164:52.78]I think they crashed.
[165:04.35]That guy just crashed the helicopter.
[165:06.75]That was awesome though.
[165:08.13]I was like, he was my personal driver.
[165:10.45]How did you just fall?
[165:19.58]Get out of my way!
[165:22.43]Where are these people coming from?
[165:23.63]Holy shit, he has a minigun.
[165:33.98]I was just kidding.
[165:34.80]I wasn't gonna do it.
[165:38.32]That was the best splat ever.
[165:39.38]Yeah, that was a long way.
[165:40.90]I, like, hugged the medium.
[165:49.22]Alright, we gotta have a melee fight.
[165:55.80]Andrew Bear, thank you for three months.
[165:57.16]Welcome back, dude.
[166:09.15]I'm just kicking him in the back of his leg.
[166:11.69]Alright, how much further you got?
[166:17.29]Jesus!
[166:18.25]What the fuck?
[166:19.75]He just slashed me once and I died.
[166:21.39]I wanna just club him right in the fucking head.
[166:38.62]Are you serious?
[166:52.68]How long is this?
[166:53.60]This guy's a waypoint.
[166:59.55]Are we going to the airport or something?
[167:09.80]I ran out of coffee.
[167:10.68]That's not good.
[167:12.02]That's how you know I need to go get more.
[167:15.64]Hey, easy.
[167:16.16]Watch your driving, dude.
[167:19.18]Watch yourself.
[167:32.87]That's right.
[167:33.27]Keep driving.
[167:35.39]Take me to the airport.
[167:36.59]Now.
[167:40.17]What is out here?
[167:41.59]Why are we surrounded by red blips?
[167:48.04]What is this?
[167:54.88]I don't understand why these guys are hostile.
[167:59.44]Is this like a free mode event or something?
[168:05.73]I'm going to get in the back.
[168:09.17]Holy shit.
[168:10.53]You have a minigun on the back of your car.
[168:13.37]How do I get on that?
[168:14.07]This is very important for me to touch this.
[168:21.24]Oh my goodness, this is fucking crazy.
[168:24.33]How do you get this on your car?
[168:26.13]This is like a fucking hundred million dollars.
[168:29.43]Star, you failed a heist apparently.
[168:33.83]I said, has fumbled a heist.
[168:37.17]Oh yeah, because I failed the intro story heist.
[168:40.72]Because you technically always fail it.
[168:44.64]That's funny.
[168:48.58]Let's just go mow some people down.
[168:52.01]Wait what?
[168:53.45]That was so fucking funny dude So you know like my resub sound is wait what?
[169:00.04]You in the battle bots You fell down or something and you went wait what?
[169:05.82]And the second you said the T in what the sound happened Wait what?
[169:11.77]Wait what?
[169:16.19]What are some other players?
[169:17.55]We're gonna start like a war
[169:21.28]What was the mystery game we played?
[169:22.54]It was BattleBots, or Robot Arena 3.
[169:31.28]Why are we just so alone out here?
[169:32.90]Is he getting ammo?
[169:48.05]Here comes Leedriff, or Ledriff.
[169:50.25]Thank you, dude.
[169:50.75]Welcome.
[169:53.09]Welcome to the channel.
[169:54.97]Thanks for subbing.
[169:56.19]Appreciate it.
[170:00.84]We gotta get like a bunch of wanted stars so then everyone knows we're the psychos so they try to get us, right?
[170:04.84]Isn't that how it works?
[170:13.68]Are you almost ready?
[170:14.30]How much longer you got?
[170:16.16]No.
[170:18.24]I think I have to get to the first save point with Franklin.
[170:21.90]Jesus.
[170:26.66]It's kind of outrageous that I have to do this anyway.
[170:31.30]I, like, beat half the game.
[170:32.50]Alright, there's a guy over here.
[170:35.60]To the right.
[170:36.98]If we take a right turn, then I can just start mowing this guy down.
[170:40.71]Hey, what's going on, Mark?
[170:46.77]All shame, no well.
[170:48.15]Thank you for five months, dude.
[170:50.69]Mark!
[170:51.63]Marky Mark.
[170:53.63]He's a good dude.
[170:54.29]I suggest you all, uh...
[170:56.76]Yeah, does he remember that guy's tiny head?
[170:59.36]I'm sure he remembers you losing your fucking mind.
[171:03.94]You go ahead and tell that story, because you're the person that like... I've never told that on my stream.
[171:08.42]You've never told that story?
[171:09.48]No.
[171:10.46]You lost your damn mind.
[171:13.70]That was like the oddest I've ever seen you behave.
[171:16.62]Actually, I think I might have told it.
[171:18.62]I can't remember.
[171:20.40]Anyway, we went to a Denny's at 2am.
[171:24.63]I laugh at everything when I'm really tired.
[171:27.76]But some really, like, big, beefy guys, like, walked into the Denny's.
[171:33.42]And I even, for some reason in my brain, made a note of it.
[171:38.23]That these guys are, like, huge.
[171:39.65]They have, like, giant shoulders.
[171:40.97]Like, I was like, wow, those are, like, they could be football players.
[171:44.45]And the guy sits down and faces us.
[171:46.15]And as he sits down, I realize he has the smallest head I've ever seen.
[171:50.43]I lost my mind.
[171:52.79]But what was really funny is that I kept bringing it up over and over again, trying to get Jerma to laugh about it, and he wouldn't.
[172:01.38]Yeah, I was just like... Like 20 minutes later, I finally cracked when I said, you remember... Remember Beetlejuice?
[172:09.70]The voodoo doctor who shrinks heads?
[172:11.25]That's what he looked like.
[172:12.57]And then that image in my head, I laughed for about 20 minutes straight.
[172:16.46]I don't think people realize, like, when we're talking about laughing, we're talking about tears streaming down your face.
[172:21.18]Like, it was the funniest thing you have ever heard or seen in your entire life.
[172:25.66]I have never laughed harder than I did that day.
[172:28.26]And I don't think I ever will.
[172:29.88]And I started laughing, and I started... It was like, really, here's the thing, like, that was a...
[172:34.35]All shame no wow that was like our first time ever like we were hanging out with them, right?
[172:39.18]Just like first time saying hi, you know It was one of those situations where like this awkward fucking psycho next to me is like Cry laughing at something that nobody even really knows why Hold on a second.
[172:50.60]There's a fucking guy next to me Because you two you you didn't you were getting sick of me bringing it up again until I asked you Hey, do you remember Beetlejuice?
[172:59.85]Like you didn't
[173:01.84]He didn't know it was still making a connection.
[173:04.11]And then I started laughing because that connection made me laugh because you thought it was so funny.
[173:09.69]And you wouldn't stop for like 25 straight minutes.
[173:13.71]I was crying and it physically was hurting me.
[173:22.06]I think we're just kind of driving around here.
[173:31.51]That guy's back.
[173:32.47]By the way, I just totally just was a dick to that guy.
[173:36.67]I'm sorry.
[173:37.99]Did they know that you were laughing at them?
[173:39.51]I had to turn and sit the other way so that I couldn't see them, otherwise I'd laugh more.
[173:43.44]Yeah, he had to physically position himself so he couldn't... It's like a child, you know what I mean?
[173:50.68]Like, if it's not there, it doesn't exist in his brain.
[173:53.32]Yeah.
[173:54.54]Every time I, like, looked over, I'd start laughing.
[174:00.31]Alright, let's go off-road.
[174:02.72]Not my proudest moment.
[174:04.16]Flip this thing over so I just break my neck.
[174:09.20]Dory sucks.
[174:14.54]Is he drunk?
[174:15.22]No.
[174:16.92]Not at all.
[174:20.32]Is there a picture of that guy?
[174:21.48]Oh, dude, that also just reminded me, we watched, um, we were watching, like, UFC-style, whatever you call that.
[174:30.23]It wasn't UFC, but, you know, you get the idea.
[174:32.97]Yeah.
[174:33.57]That guy got kicked so hard in the nuts.
[174:36.15]I have never seen a person get kicked harder in the nuts than the, like, UFC that we were watching.
[174:41.63]And we waited for, like, ten minutes for a replay, and they would not show a replay of it.
[174:45.45]What the fuck did that guy go for?
[174:49.98]Who the fuck was that?
[174:53.34]I thought that was a player.
[174:54.58]That wasn't a player?
[174:57.56]No, it was just a random guy.
[175:05.82]Okay, well, whatever.
[175:12.40]It was Mr. Sneak Man.
[175:24.83]No, I was messing around.
[175:25.59]That wasn't real.
[175:29.28]Geez, man.
[175:30.64]Ow, I'm getting hurt.
[175:31.10]Getting hurt.
[175:35.84]Yeah, take them out.
[175:37.63]Shoot over there.
[175:38.11]Get those bad guys.
[175:38.85]Get them.

[176:37.04]Oh, no.
[176:38.30]I better do something about that.
[176:46.60]He's riding all the cops on army or anything, so I can just walk around.
[176:49.71]Uh-oh.
[176:52.65]Watch out for the one psycho that drives into everybody.
[177:00.75]He's just driving over cops.
[177:02.41]They shot him in the head.
[177:10.26]What did he just bump into?
[177:16.50]Oh, Jesus.
[177:19.67]Is that guy alive?
[177:22.35]This is really... I don't like being over here.
[177:25.63]Oh, my God.

[178:07.12]We need to see if he gets to his destination.
[178:09.41]To chase that one guy that drove head-on into another car.
[178:15.23]What is he saying?
[178:15.83]Is he scared of me?
[178:19.16]He has a fucking gun.
[178:24.80]What is this guy doing?
[178:30.74]He put his gun away.
[178:31.66]Oh, are you kidding me?
[178:44.62]What?
[178:46.65]He was alive and he shot me with a gun.

[184:22.61]You took too long.
[184:27.25]You took too long to open your phone and press confirm.
[184:35.39]D.Va voice?
[184:36.17]Everyone wants me to do D.Va?
[184:43.38]We're not playing Overwatch right now.
[184:47.16]Invite via social club next time.
[184:48.64]I would've if I didn't know that this guy didn't understand anything.
[184:57.37]I'm getting the ring around.
[185:06.03]Oh, you're spectating.
[185:06.75]That's good.
[185:09.79]Oh, my God.
[185:10.57]Did that really just happen?
[185:13.77]That just happened to me.
[185:15.13]Yeah, it did.
[185:19.69]Are you dead?
[185:20.17]1-2, lost 31.
[185:21.37]I don't play to win.
[185:22.66]I play to have fun in GTA.
[185:24.92]I want to play the pinball one.
[185:27.18]Yeah, well, I got Insta-locked.
[185:29.42]Knocked off.
[185:30.32]Insta-lock.
[185:33.22]You picked Hanzo.
[185:36.32]Oh, this one is the one I wanted to play.
[185:37.96]Do you get points for these?
[185:46.17]Definitely not.
[185:49.99]He's going to get it.
[185:50.79]Come on.
[185:52.73]Okay, I expected that to be a light thing to hit with the fucking car.
[185:56.41]No, it's not.
[185:58.78]It's extremely heavy and you can't push it.
[186:00.22]This guy's having some trouble.
[186:05.26]So is this guy.
[186:08.71]How have I not lost that much ground?
[186:13.55]I will not ever know.
[186:20.70]Bowling sucks.
[186:21.54]Alright, when Star gets in this game, I have to actually try.
[186:30.66]Are you racing?
[186:32.16]I'm in sixth place.
[186:35.30]Oh, I see.
[186:36.52]Every time I play, I'm in sixth place.
[186:37.98]Every time, no matter what.
[186:38.96]Doesn't matter if there's ten people, twelve people, nine, ten, six people.
[186:42.41]If I switch players that I'm spectating, it only takes about, I'd say, fifteen seconds to load.
[186:47.37]Yeah, it's not cool.
[186:48.19]Are those coins?
[186:53.85]No.
[186:54.45]Those look like coins from down there.
[187:03.34]Okay.
[187:04.74]I'm officially spectating you.
[187:06.32]Turn left.
[187:06.80]These tunnels destroy stream quality.
[187:09.58]I can imagine that, because they're just like a ton of different pixel data.
[187:12.54]100 meters, turn left.
[187:14.48]I know when to turn and when not to, okay?
[187:17.92]100 meters, go straight up.
[187:20.26]Oh, this is sick.
[187:24.19]Ah-hoo!
[187:25.03]Ah-hoo!
[187:25.87]Ah-hoo!
[187:32.06]That guy blew up.
[187:33.66]Not in sixth place anymore.
[187:36.78]Just ahead.
[187:38.44]Go straight down.
[187:40.52]This is a drop, huh?
[187:43.35]Oh, this is the first part.
[187:59.48]I love that camera.
[188:00.34]It's just so stupid.
[188:06.36]Even streaming at the maximum bitrate, it doesn't matter.
[188:11.71]When you go through this tunnel, it's just going to be a blurry blob on everybody's screen.
[188:24.68]Sick air, bro.
[188:36.09]Here's the thing.
[188:39.41]Somebody brought this up last time I streamed this game.
[188:41.85]And they're absolutely correct.
[188:43.51]It is the thing noise.
[188:50.70]Have any secret tips for me?
[188:55.22]Watch out for the X-Men.
[189:02.60]Whoa!
[189:04.18]I'm gonna throw up.
[189:06.48]Jesus.
[189:06.98]That was too many G's.
[189:09.30]I might pass this guy, too.
[189:16.31]He's going too slow, and he's driving erratically.
[189:19.11]So I'm not gonna pass him.
[189:22.01]Ow, I just bumped my funny boom.
[189:23.11]That hurt.
[189:24.37]Ow, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[189:29.19]Goodbye.
[189:30.99]See you later.
[189:35.07]Where's my stunt meter?
[189:39.30]I landed it kind of on his car.
[189:41.06]This guy's going to try to slip screen me.
[189:48.82]Alright.
[189:50.90]Hopefully you can play this next one.
[190:03.85]Snow and confetti have ruined YouTube video quality.
[190:05.89]He explains what's up with that.
[190:08.97]This guy just didn't give a fuck anymore.
[190:16.25]You can always tell when somebody doesn't give a fuck.
[190:18.85]When they try to do a full frame.
[190:20.71]What?
[190:28.00]How is he out of his car?
[190:33.39]Get out of the car?
[190:35.15]You can't get out of the car and he's right... How did he do that?
[190:44.99]He was naked.
[190:45.89]Dude, that was just a guy on a track.
[190:49.25]Something like naked, drugged out guy just walked onto the track.
[190:54.96]Oh.
[190:59.31]Oh, are you in this lobby now?
[191:00.77]Police say you are.
[191:01.86]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[191:03.92]Okay, good.
[191:05.08]Plummet, plummet's fun.
[191:13.36]That was amazing.
[191:19.97]You can get out if you take off all your clothes.
[191:22.99]What?
[191:25.65]What the fuck does that mean?
[191:26.79]It says...
[191:32.68]okay so if I go if I take all my clothes off I can get out of my car I don't know that's what he says if that's true if that's true what are you doing auto
[191:53.91]Oh, people want the Tinder update.
[191:55.56]Okay, so remember last time we left, we were going to potentially... Yeah, I got our number.
[192:01.62]We've been talking.
[192:03.26]And I'm pretty sure this coming weekend, we're going on a date.
[192:06.18]So... Yoink, yoink, there's your update.
[192:09.08]Yoink, yoink, yoink.
[192:13.31]You don't like yoink, yoink at all, do you?
[192:14.95]That's why I keep saying it.
[192:17.49]Uh, in that context, Yoinky Yoink sounds like you're gonna Yoinky Yoinker.
[192:22.30]No, no, no, no.
[192:23.06]That means like, here we are, like, things are going well, Yoinky Yoinker, things are going alright here.
[192:28.16]People don't know the other Yoinky Yoink clip because you're never going to upload it.
[192:33.39]You say that, but you don't make videos anymore.
[192:35.49]Neither do you.
[192:36.89]Hey, hey, hey, don't throw stones if you live in a glass house.
[192:42.19]Huh?
[192:43.27]Huh?
[192:44.34]That's fine.
[192:44.88]I stream like six hours a day at least.
[192:48.76]Please.
[192:57.06]I'm streaming right now.
[192:58.08]How come your stream's not on?
[193:00.44]Yoink, yoink.
[193:01.02]Just got you with that one.
[193:04.27]I actually technically streamed longer than you have so far because I streamed three hours before you showed up.
[193:09.26]And then it took you 40 minutes because you're late.
[193:11.24]Dude, you're just playing Overwatch.
[193:12.30]But I've streamed almost about four hours longer than you still.
[193:15.50]You're just like playing Overwatch.
[193:17.22]It's like Anna.
[193:18.10]We've seen it a hundred times, Star.
[193:19.54]Anna's like, hey, fun.
[193:22.33]ResidentSleeper.
[193:23.05]It's fun.
[193:27.97]It's fun.
[193:30.85]Oh, here we go.
[193:31.19]Star's gonna play Pharah again for like seven hours.
[193:33.90]Resident fucking sleeper.
[193:39.04]Where's your character?
[193:49.82]Alright, so I'm going to assume that you're gonna try to fuck this up for everybody?
[193:57.47]Hey, hey, chat!
[193:59.37]You guys should be on my side, because that means Jorma should stream more.
[194:04.53]You disagree?
[194:05.79]Watch this one, babe.
[194:07.44]Babe.
[194:10.04]Where is he?
[194:12.90]He's probably so far behind at this point.
[194:17.75]I guarantee you, he's just so far behind.
[194:19.91]I am...
[194:29.56]I'm in second place.
[194:30.76]You're in second place?
[194:31.70]I'm in first place now.
[194:33.10]Oh, that's interesting.
[194:35.99]You know... I'm the yellow car.
[194:37.35]That's really, really interesting.
[194:41.13]If I didn't have a couple of dickheads, I would have... I would... I'm... I'm... I'm fine.
[194:50.60]And that guy just gave me the boost I needed.
[194:53.48]To continue...
[195:18.37]Getting right up this guy.
[195:24.44]I'm getting there.
[195:26.08]Oh, getting close.
[195:33.53]Right there.
[195:34.37]I don't know.
[195:35.47]I'm still in first place.
[195:37.11]Yeah, you are.
[195:38.77]You are in first place.
[195:40.31]Fuck!
[195:42.01]God damn it!
[195:43.09]Later!
[195:50.54]I'm just gonna get in first place because I'm gonna try as hard as I can to win every race because I don't like having fun unless I'm fucking winning.
[196:01.41]Is that what you meant to say?
[196:06.68]Video games aren't fun.
[196:08.10]I have to win every single time when they're not fun.
[196:14.31]Get out of here with that fucking attitude.
[196:16.51]It sounds like I'm having more fun than you.
[196:19.26]Oh, really?
[196:20.02]I'm like on tilt.
[196:31.13]What's going on?
[196:31.75]Luke and Gabe.
[196:32.51]Luke and Gabe, thanks for stopping, dude.
[196:55.83]Come on, really?
[196:59.84]Come on!
[197:00.56]Leave me alone!
[197:01.24]I'm on a fucking mission here!
[197:02.60]I got so fucked over.
[197:33.81]Anybody?
[197:35.89]There's one fucking person I'm going for.
[197:44.26]How am I going the right way now?
[197:46.48]What?
[197:52.50]Wait, oh no, I'm stuck.
[198:00.67]I can't even drive.
[198:01.55]Where the fuck is he?
[198:09.23]I finished already.
[198:10.23]Oh, did you finish already?
[198:12.01]Yeah.
[198:16.99]I was going to just try to crash right into you.
[198:22.61]You finished in fourth place.
[198:24.73]What happened?
[198:26.01]What happened?
[198:26.55]I told you.
[198:28.64]When you said I tried too hard, I went back a couple.
[198:31.68]That's a good excuse.
[198:32.38]Let's try and have fun.
[198:34.38]Oh, good excuse.
[198:35.38]I had more fun in fourth place.
[198:44.18]Just take off your clothing.
[198:45.33]Oh, that was funny.
[198:51.65]Did not finish.
[198:52.77]How do I fucking, how do I dislike him?
[199:05.15]Worse than Garfield Cart?
[199:06.45]What's Garfield Cart?
[199:18.75]Do Threading the Needle.
[199:20.91]Turbine is very, very long.
[199:23.59]I seriously want to figure out how to take my clothes off, though.
[199:39.73]Yonky, yonk.
[199:40.29]I'm going to have to check out what Garfield card is, man.
[199:48.32]That sounds like fun.
[199:55.30]Alright, we're going for... We're going to play for real.
[199:59.20]I bet you Jerm is sweaty.
[200:00.18]Yeah, he is.
[200:03.80]Yeah, he is.
[200:10.73]Bet you I get first place in Garfield's cart.
[200:13.91]Is it on PC?
[200:15.05]Whatever it is, I want to play it.
[200:20.47]On call.
[200:20.93]Okay, can we get this guy off the fucking phone?
[200:23.70]Like, stream.
[200:25.28]This guy's, like, texting and he's not even, like, streaming.
[200:27.28]I'm not doing that today.
[200:30.62]We already had a, uh... We already determined what we were doing.
[200:33.40]We'll see.
[200:49.85]Oh my god, well Star's ranked 25, Jerma's ranked 35.
[200:52.57]Star, what, it's ranked 25?
[200:54.47]Jerma, why are you like ranked 30 in Overwatch?
[201:01.93]How do I type?
[201:02.63]How do I fucking scream at this guy?
[201:04.35]I have never done one of these races before.
[201:06.37]These are like goofball joke races.
[201:09.76]We warmed up like two days ago.
[201:12.08]These are fucking like goofball joke races.
[201:14.50]You can't talk shit!
[201:17.73]That's like saying that you eat Captain... No, that's like saying that you eat Lucky Charms for the fucking regular cereal part.
[201:29.81]Like, what a dumb thing to say.
[201:32.91]No, I really love Lucky Charms.
[201:34.58]I kind of like to eat around the marshmallows and eat just the cereal, the grains.
[201:38.32]It's like... Okay.
[201:42.38]It's there for fun.
[201:43.24]You eat the marshmallows.
[201:44.54]Give me a break.
[201:56.91]See, he already gets an advantage probably.
[201:58.64]I'm at like the very end of the line.
[202:04.14]Germs on drugs?
[202:04.86]I'm not on drugs.
[202:06.80]Unless you count caffeine, which is barely.
[202:09.16]That guy didn't even move.
[202:17.62]I love people that just go right off in the very beginning.
[202:19.86]It's awesome.
[202:21.60]Like, it was almost just me.
[202:22.76]Like, this guy's trying to get...
[202:25.77]That guy's trying to get rid of me and he ended up fucking himself over.
[202:28.37]I wish it was daytime.
[202:48.86]The alarm always just scares the shit out of me.
[202:50.54]I never know what the fuck it's trying to tell me.
[203:05.25]They're out of my way.
[203:09.55]Are you threading the needle?
[203:11.15]Looks like you're threading the needle pretty well.
[203:12.41]That guy didn't thread the needle.
[203:25.96]Fuck me right in my... How do you... How do you reset?
[203:33.56]What's the button?
[203:35.34]Hold on, why?
[203:39.17]I love how I just landed on your head.
[203:40.83]I mean, I was in second until I fell in.
[204:01.90]I didn't even... I didn't know.
[204:03.46]I couldn't tell.
[204:07.27]I mean, like, someone here has played this race before, so he has no excuse.
[204:10.09]Yeah, he got an advantage.
[204:12.77]This guy's got the advantage this time.
[204:15.91]Advantage, player one.
[204:18.19]Love, 30.
[204:20.39]Love, 40.
[204:22.19]Deuce.
[204:22.43]I'm gonna take a deuce on your chest.
[204:26.49]How dare you.
[204:29.34]Hey, I double dare you.
[204:33.37]Which one?
[204:34.01]Green or blue?
[204:34.53]Green or blue?
[204:35.55]Green.
[204:51.02]This is tough, man.
[204:51.86]That little section is tough.
[204:53.00]It gets you.
[204:56.02]Fucking candy cane again.
[204:59.93]Get the fuck out of here!
[205:02.21]I'm trying to like fucking punch you.
[205:07.50]I forgot you can't like take weapons out.
[205:09.22]That guy is still there.
[205:13.24]It's the guy that's naked.
[205:28.50]Oh, yucky!
[205:34.04]I'm just like bucking around now.
[205:35.92]Why did I want to stop to like fucking try to hit you with my bike?
[205:40.51]Why did I try to hurt you?
[205:42.65]I would have been way ahead of you.
[205:44.31]I had to try to like fight you.
[205:45.65]What the fuck?
[205:48.79]This guy's so erratic.
[206:00.46]Oh, yucky.
[206:11.07]Always use protection 2.
[206:13.69]Just subscribe.
[206:14.35]What happened to always use protection 1?
[206:16.03]Did he not use protection?
[206:17.86]Is that why this account, you made this one to make sure that people do?
[206:23.56]But anyways, thank you for subbing.
[206:24.68]Welcome to...
[206:29.81]Jimmy Walker left, now I'm not getting any experience.
[206:38.47]Straight through.
[206:49.97]Oh, watch out.
[206:57.96]The pixel maniac.
[207:07.22]That guy right behind me, that's not good.
[207:10.32]You're gonna fuck his bolt over.
[207:14.01]Thankfully he didn't, but I'm behind him.
[207:19.55]Oh yeah!
[207:38.13]I'm gonna drive right into a fucking tree That guy got stuck in the candy cane see it sucks when you get stuck on fucking candy cane It seems to happen every time
[208:07.77]Confused me guy is not very good.
[208:11.87]Somebody just needs to fucking ram him.
[208:17.16]It's great that his name is confused me and he actually is confused sitting here.
[208:27.77]Well, he did not finish.
[208:32.51]Squash your beef with Ster.
[208:35.53]We always have beef.
[208:36.39]There's no beef to squash.
[208:37.75]It's never going to be squash.
[208:38.83]You're ugly!
[208:41.77]Oh, really?
[208:42.09]Because on www.hotornot.com, I got an 8.6.
[208:45.95]I'm a five-star man.
[208:49.35]Sorry, in like 2002, like 2003, I got like an 8.7 on hotornot.com.
[208:56.84]So, that's not a correct statement, apparently, according to anonymity.
[209:09.12]Betting 10 grand on me in the next race.
[209:10.79]That's a big mistake.
[209:17.19]I'm betting on you too.
[209:21.89]Just throw.
[209:25.07]Got a 9 out of 10 on Rate My Poo.
[209:27.39]Ronnie, what is that?
[209:32.72]I've seen Rate My Poo.
[209:36.74]That's disgusting.
[209:39.30]Some of them are really good.
[209:44.78]That is gross.
[209:45.94]No, don't do Downtown Loop.
[209:47.74]I hate this one.
[209:50.00]Oh my god.
[209:50.50]I'm going to go to Downtown Loop.
[209:52.40]This is going to be dumb.
[210:07.23]Rate my nose hairs?
[210:15.52]Can you pet Otto?
[210:18.40]Um... No, you're not here.
[210:22.24]He's a very pettable dog, though.
[210:33.35]Non-stop pop, FM.
[210:37.31]I gotta take a shower, too.
[210:38.01]I don't need to hop in the shower.
[210:39.11]It's, like, so hot out.
[210:40.93]Why is there, like, a three-minute cooldown between each race?
[210:45.58]Because it's a MOBA.
[210:46.50]We're doing our pick and bans right now.
[210:48.36]Oh, because this is Dune multiplayer.
[210:51.57]Oh, boy.
[210:55.13]Boy, oh, boy.
[210:58.33]Use a facecam.
[211:02.09]No, I'm in like... You don't want to use a facecam when you're that ugly.
[211:12.57]Nice.
[211:15.48]No, I don't do facecam because I can just sit here like a bag of shit and nothing doesn't matter.
[211:20.62]See, people like that do face cams and shit, they got to get like ready.
[211:24.24]You got to like turn the facecam on.
[211:25.39]You got to like know, do I look like shit today?
[211:27.57]Do I smell like shit today?
[211:29.07]It doesn't fucking matter what I look like today.
[211:32.65]I could have like my hair sticking up straight.
[211:34.97]I could have my pants on and shit.
[211:36.37]It doesn't fucking matter.
[211:37.15]I don't need a facecam.
[211:46.82]Listen to me, son.
[211:49.31]I'm your dad.
[211:51.73]Destroy him!
[211:55.17]Whoa!
[211:56.81]Dark Aeos.
[211:57.97]Or Dark Ice.
[211:59.63]Dark Aeos.
[212:01.03]Dark Aeos.
[212:03.34]Thanks a lot, dude.
[212:03.88]Welcome.
[212:04.66]Welcome, welcome.
[212:05.24]Well, welcome to the smell stream where we, like, pretend what I smell like.
[212:09.54]Probably, like, regular old-fashioned Old Spice.
[212:14.81]with a hint of puke.
[212:19.31]No, not like that.
[212:21.17]That's what an ugly person would say.
[212:22.69]Hand cam?
[212:23.46]No.
[212:25.14]Let's do this, fucking guys.
[212:26.52]Just always standing around texting before we start races.
[212:31.38]And now I'm gonna get knocked over.
[212:32.90]And I have a slow shit car.
[212:40.72]I really...
[212:44.24]Why do people keep doing that?
[212:49.25]This guy already has that idea.
[212:51.33]We haven't even got past the first, like, two checkpoints.
[212:53.89]And people are already turning around and driving the other direction.
[212:57.43]Really?
[213:01.76]No, don't fuck that up.
[213:03.78]You tried, but you failed.
[213:12.52]It keeps telling me I'm going the wrong way.
[213:15.08]Oh, fucking... EAT SHIT!
[213:17.32]Yeah, why does it say I'm going the wrong way?
[213:18.96]Did I miss a checkpoint?
[213:22.30]What the fuck?
[213:24.22]Oh my god, how many of us missed it?
[213:26.12]I missed the very first checkpoint.
[213:28.02]I don't know how I did either.
[213:30.66]How is that even possible?
[213:33.36]I don't know, but we both did.
[213:34.60]No!
[213:42.03]See?
[213:42.69]Everyone thought I was dumb, but you did it too.
[213:45.94]It's impossible to miss.
[213:53.90]I was legitimately in first place.
[213:57.00]There was definitely no one in front of me.
[214:00.20]I was too.
[214:01.78]I was in first place too.
[214:03.02]Yeah, you were in first place.
[214:06.38]I can say a bunch of things that I can't prove too.
[214:18.79]Wow, this game sucks.
[214:19.95]Fuck out of my way, motherfucker!
[214:33.56]I love how that didn't put me that far behind you.
[214:47.23]And I'm still... I'm still right behind him.
[214:59.53]I almost just wasn't going fast enough to do that.
[215:16.98]Ohhhhhh, please get on it.
[215:19.62]Get out of the way.
[215:26.29]I got places to be.
[215:32.35]Don't fuck me over, please.
[215:38.21]Come on.
[215:41.56]This guy's like an annoying gnat that just flies around your head.
[215:54.79]He's right there.
[215:57.11]Gotta get up there.
[215:58.05]You gotta make a mistake.
[215:59.65]Somebody exploded.
[216:13.66]Ster is being a mute stream tryhard.
[216:16.28]I'm being a... I'm really hungry.
[216:26.73]And also, my in-game radio was at 100 volume, when everything else was at 10.
[216:33.80]Which is fine, because I turned the radio off, but every time I reset my position, it would turn back on.
[216:38.44]So I may have stopped to fix that.
[216:51.77]Sure.
[216:52.69]Whatever you say.
[216:53.33]Whatever makes you sleep at night a little easier.
[216:56.53]You haven't had breakfast yet?
[217:02.39]Should have had something like yogurt.
[217:05.14]I barely had anything.
[217:06.90]Why didn't you have any yogurt?
[217:10.60]I think it's your fault.
[217:12.22]My fault?
[217:14.96]Why is it my fault again?
[217:18.33]Most things are.
[217:19.85]Yeah, sure.
[217:22.72]I can see that.
[217:26.83]Must be problematic for you.
[217:29.27]Knowing that everything in your life is my fault.
[217:36.24]If you finish, um... Where are you?
[217:40.40]Are you in 9th or are you in 8th?
[217:42.52]11th.
[217:43.78]Oh, so I'm winning.
[217:45.44]Oh, my fucking god, this goddamn guy.
[217:47.52]Of course, I say that word.
[217:49.06]I say the word, and somebody decides to turn their fucking car around and drive into me over and over again.
[217:57.66]That's just fantastic.
[217:59.88]I stopped and went into my options menu.
[218:01.88]I think I'm, like, absolute last.
[218:03.74]Dude, you might fucking pass me.
[218:08.78]You're not going to have to get that embarrassment.
[218:14.66]Of course that guy just waits.
[218:15.98]I wouldn't have DNF'd.
[218:18.95]I would have F'd.
[218:21.57]For the first time ever, Jerma would have F'd.
[218:23.87]Yeah, we're going to give that one a clean like.
[218:35.80]I'm going to dislike it, based solely on the point that several people in the race missed the first checkpoint.
[218:44.08]I don't know how that happened.
[218:44.82]I think, well, there was like a clusterfuck in the beginning, and I think we got caught in it and just got thrown to the sides.
[218:49.00]I have no idea.
[218:49.50]But, no, if you drive... No.
[218:53.70]That shouldn't have been that big of a deal, yeah, I know.
[218:59.00]If I had an answer for you, I'd give it to you.
[219:00.52]And I definitely didn't drive down the side.
[219:03.68]I want to go back in time and figure out what happened.
[219:06.34]Alright, star's pick.
[219:09.06]Which one?
[219:11.15]City Air.
[219:13.03]Let's do Threading the Needle.
[219:15.73]We could do Nightlife.
[219:17.97]Hit up some of those good spots, get a couple of beers.
[219:21.13]No, I only want to do Threading the Needle.
[219:22.97]Forever.
[219:25.46]Just do the same one over and over again and bet $10,000 on yourself.
[219:29.96]And get to the point where you've memorized the whole thing so much.
[219:42.56]Now we get to set up this screen.
[219:45.10]I like this phrase.
[219:47.58]Now this screen.
[219:53.08]The invite players screen.
[219:55.78]Don't drink and bike?
[219:58.08]I wish.
[219:58.86]You know, we should do a custom one where it's, like, all on, like, fucking tricycles.
[220:02.18]Just, like, regular, like, bikes.
[220:07.93]Like, bicycles.
[220:10.01]Do you even do that on these maps?
[220:11.45]Are bicycles in... Yeah, like, regular just pedal bikes are in GTA 5, right?
[220:16.09]yeah let's try to do it let's do custom we'll invite after this one yeah I don't know if it'll let you do it though because like some of these seem like they wouldn't even be completable with a bike all these big jumps although it would be hilarious going like 200 miles per hour on that yeah it would be impossible people just get like up to the top of a hill and just fall backwards
[220:46.50]Normal bicycles like tricycles Well in the GTA sense a normal bicycle is pretty much a tricycle compared to everything else Then what's a bicycle I'm just saying in comparison No way No way
[221:15.25]Only two dumb cars.
[221:26.01]I still don't understand how that guy got out of the car, and why hasn't he done it since?
[221:37.28]Okay, now wait on this screen.
[221:49.90]Doing all trucks.
[221:51.82]Just huge Mack trucks.
[221:57.88]When am I going to do a trunk stream?
[221:59.48]No, probably not.
[222:03.26]It like forced me into a different car.
[222:04.86]I didn't pick this car.
[222:07.53]It's the legal limit of what you're allowed to pick.
[222:11.87]I picked it like a fucking hour ago.
[222:15.89]I drove into a guy that didn't accelerate, so I'm in last.
[222:20.42]That's okay.
[222:21.02]Well, not unless two guys didn't hold down right trigger, so we're fine.
[222:30.57]City air!
[222:32.05]City air!
[222:34.01]How did he fix himself that quickly?
[222:40.98]Shitty air.
[222:41.98]More like it.
[222:45.82]If I make this jump, am I going fast enough?
[222:47.20]Yeah.
[222:55.51]Oh, yoinky-yoink.
[222:56.77]Oh, there we go.
[222:57.57]Yoinky-yoink.
[223:01.13]You guys better straighten yourselves out.
[223:02.50]Well, that guy didn't.
[223:06.34]Do not fuck me.
[223:09.54]Thank God I got around him.
[223:10.36]Oh, I'll fuck you.
[223:11.26]I got around him.
[223:11.88]It's okay.
[223:12.32]I'm going way over.
[223:13.46]I'm landing on top of people.
[223:15.12]Woo!
[223:17.04]Going a little too fast.
[223:19.28]Just a little too fast.
[223:23.97]That guy just backed off I love watching that when people just like slowly creep backwards off the track You can tell they're going like no no no no no
[223:51.01]I love how if you get stuck back here with like the fucking three car pile up dickheads, this is gonna happen every time.
[223:58.32]Yeah.
[224:01.40]Between like 8th and 13th, if you get like, if you fall back here, you're gonna get in like a wreck every 10 seconds.
[224:11.74]Well, I was in second until I can't even explain to you how someone landed on top of my car.
[224:25.20]That would have been hilarious.
[224:48.10]See ya!
[224:52.98]I'm using these things as a half-pipe.
[224:54.54]It's not really a good idea.
[225:01.41]Yeah!
[225:04.79]My car looks like a cigarette pack.
[225:06.83]Yeah, it does.
[225:17.09]Get behind him!
[225:18.09]Get behind him!
[225:28.05]I know you're behind me.
[225:30.83]No, it's not you.
[225:37.69]Too much.
[225:38.83]Too much.
[225:44.06]Too much of the handbrake.
[225:51.92]Do I go running?
[225:52.84]Not really.
[225:53.28]I'm not a runner.
[226:05.90]I think I almost lost control.
[226:06.82]Oh god!
[226:19.31]Oh god!
[226:20.19]How was I going... I was going so fast.
[226:26.83]Why was I going that fast?
[226:32.07]I was going like absurdly fast.
[226:34.41]It was like a joke.
[226:39.41]Good luck.
[226:39.73]You're in the four car pileup.
[226:42.76]Have fun.
[226:44.26]Oh, you dodged it.
[226:46.35]You actually dodged it.
[227:06.51]Yeah, like, using the thing as a half-pipe makes you go, like, 400 fucking miles per hour.
[227:10.43]Oh, come on.
[227:29.39]No!
[227:31.71]Wow.
[227:34.89]Fucking dick.
[227:46.41]I'm gonna try it.
[227:46.85]I'm gonna go for it.
[227:49.67]Oh, shit.
[227:50.83]I didn't know.
[227:55.15]I was trying to go for, like, the zip zoom, and it didn't work.
[228:01.63]Zip zoom didn't work.
[228:02.62]I tried it.
[228:04.40]No zip zoom?
[228:05.22]No.
[228:07.64]I would have just slingshotted myself across everybody.

[241:15.82]That doesn't make any sense.
[241:21.68]Wait, why did I end up here?
[241:24.40]Oh, it's because this is where I was driving to.
[241:29.42]So that's not possible.
