[00:28.21]Central Command.
[00:29.27]Central Command, come in.
[00:30.79]I'm detecting a live stream.
[00:32.69]I'm detecting a live stream.
[00:35.11]There it is.
[00:35.79]Yeah, it's Jerma985.
[00:36.67]Yeah, I know he sucks, but he's the only option we got right now.
[00:42.24]Yeah.
[00:43.60]I mean, it's not like there's like 500,000 other people playing Monster Hunter: World right now.
[00:49.26]What's that?
[00:50.90]Yeah, okay.
[00:51.44]Engage.
[00:52.02]I got you.
[00:52.95]Understood.
[00:53.73]I will watch this one.
[00:55.77]Hi.
[00:55.85]Hi.
[00:57.82]How's everybody doing?
[00:59.54]Welcome to the stream.
[01:00.20]Welcome to tonight.
[01:00.84]A little early.
[01:05.50]That's okay.
[01:08.00]And Monster Hunter!
[01:09.30]Game just came out.
[01:11.26]As you can remember, I was a big fan of Monster Hunter for the Wii U. Played that game for about, you know, four streams.
[01:18.66]And four streams in dog years for Jerma streams.
[01:22.75]That's like at least like two months worth of streaming, you know what I mean?
[01:27.66]That's how that works.
[01:29.20]Did I even tweet this out?
[01:31.24]I better have.
[01:34.54]No, I didn't.
[01:38.18]Did that shit even work?
[01:39.14]Did that shit even work?
[01:41.36]I don't think it did.
[01:46.57]Oh, god damn it.
[01:50.51]No, it did.
[01:50.99]It did.
[01:51.31]What am I talking about?
[01:52.13]I'm fine.
[01:53.17]Everything works fine.
[01:56.65]Alright, give me a moment.
[01:58.23]Give me a moment while we set up here.
[02:01.20]Me and Etalyx are going to be playing Monster Hunter: World.
[02:04.12]And my class is going to have to be a secret for you.
[02:06.11]It's a surprise what class I'm playing.
[02:09.31]You'll see.
[03:06.46]Alright, let's see if he's around.
[03:09.48]No, he definitely isn't.
[03:10.82]He's muted and deafened, which means he cannot hear a word I'm saying.
[03:16.85]God, well, unlucky for him.
[03:21.59]But yes, welcome.
[03:22.23]Yeah, this is, hold on, I gotta make sure this is going.
[03:24.03]Because when he shows up, oh boy, we better be ready.
[03:31.90]But yes, I don't know how long we're gonna be playing
[03:36.74]How long I'm going to be playing Monster Hunter: World.
[03:39.30]I would assume for a little while.
[03:42.22]This is not going to turn into one of those streams where everything else doesn't matter anymore.
[03:46.36]Oh, by the way.
[03:48.08]See you later.
[03:49.48]Every other game I wanted to play.
[03:50.78]We're just going to stream Monster Hunter for fucking three weeks.
[03:53.72]That's not going to happen.
[03:55.48]You could probably... I might get addicted to this game.
[03:58.38]It might happen.
[03:59.14]I might play a bunch off stream.
[04:00.34]I might play a bunch on stream.
[04:01.62]I don't know.
[04:02.00]I can't tell you what's going to happen.
[04:03.54]I'm not a magician.
[04:05.02]And I don't have a crystal ball.
[04:08.82]Happy Friday.
[04:12.52]You probably won't.
[04:15.44]That's true.
[04:17.92]But judging by past experience, you're likely to see this interchanged between different games and streams over the next few weeks.
[04:29.86]Unless it becomes my entire life, which I don't think it will.
[04:36.69]Ugh.
[04:38.25]That game is so much better compared to the 3DS games.
[04:41.37]I've heard very good things.
[04:42.31]This game has very, very good reviews right now.
[04:45.83]It is, uh, top of the world.
[04:47.89]In regards to, like, reviews.
[04:52.89]So, today's stream is just... We're just gonna play the absolute fuck out of Monster Hunter.
[04:57.33]So, expect this to be a... A lengthy... Livestream.
[05:02.10]This'll go... Way more than two or three hours, for sure.
[05:06.79]I don't know how long, but I'm here to play.
[05:13.15]Hello?
[05:13.45]Yeah, I can see him already.
[05:15.15]I can see him in my sights.
[05:16.15]There he is.
[05:16.59]Hello?
[05:19.67]I've got Pirates of the Caribbean music in my game.
[05:23.04]Ready for an epic adventure.
[05:24.62]You guys know who this is?
[05:25.50]It's Etalyx.
[05:28.66]They know.
[05:29.26]We've had like six streams within the last two months.
[05:32.14]They know.
[05:32.72]And hey, look at this.
[05:33.28]Now you can see the screen.
[05:36.74]You can see his cat, you can see my cat.
[05:38.84]We're here.
[05:40.76]Yeah, we get cats in this game.
[05:43.78]Isn't that cool?
[05:44.42]There we go.
[05:45.36]Jerma's now here.
[05:46.72]Everyone's here.
[05:47.44]His cat is here.
[05:48.32]Oh, shit.
[05:48.82]I just X'd out of my stream.
[05:50.26]Rocky Balboa.
[05:51.57]Yeah, that's my cat.
[05:54.69]So, expect this stream to be a real snooze.
[05:57.95]No, I'm just kidding.
[05:58.55]This is going to be fun.
[05:59.69]I've been looking forward to this for a while.
[06:00.71]We've already done all the boring parts.
[06:03.03]Yes.
[06:03.29]So, the only thing left is actual video game.
[06:05.98]Yeah, we made sure to do all the tutorial shit.
[06:09.62]We made sure to do everything that was already available.
[06:11.98]So this is the first, like, real monster.
[06:14.28]Like, we understand how to play at a very basic level.
[06:17.56]You're not going to get, like, tutorial cutscenes.
[06:20.18]We already did that.
[06:25.14]Alright, so I'm ready to play.
[06:29.53]I am also ready to play.
[06:33.36]So we should probably do that.
[06:34.32]You want to just queue us up?
[06:35.52]How do you do that?
[06:36.48]Alright.
[06:37.06]We know how to do that.
[06:37.97]We know how to do that.
[06:39.41]It's easy.
[06:39.69]We've practiced.
[06:41.39]It's easy.
[06:41.89]You just go to that device.
[06:42.91]We formed a squad.
[06:44.15]We got the same quest ready to go.
[06:47.05]We have to talk to quest lady.
[06:50.67]Talk to quest lady.
[06:52.83]It's good to see you too, quest lady.
[06:55.90]I need to turn you up a little bit.
[06:57.90]Say some things now.
[06:58.42]I'm always quiet.
[07:00.14]Alright.
[07:01.02]Now you should be able to hear us.
[07:04.26]He's whispering.
[07:05.55]On my OBS it says he's almost in the red.
[07:08.19]Alright, well let's just queue up.
[07:12.85]I'm ready to play this game.
[07:16.11]Okay.
[07:17.09]We are posting a new quest.

[08:03.84]Did you put out an SOS?
[08:05.92]I have party members one of two.
[08:08.24]Respond to SOS.
[08:11.76]I didn't put out an SOS.
[08:13.00]I posted a quest.
[08:13.82]Can you not join a quest?
[08:14.96]I'm the great joggers hunt.
[08:16.63]Okay, members.

[08:24.55]I'm ready.
[08:27.06]Alright, two of two.
[08:27.92]Let's do it, Questor.
[08:29.10]The great Jagras hunt.
[08:32.34]I think we're going.
[08:33.94]I'm ready.
[08:34.38]You have to push the button.
[08:35.86]Ready up.
[08:36.66]Stand by.
[08:37.18]Push your touchpad.
[08:39.40]I'm so fucking ready.
[08:40.66]This is going to be so much fun.
[08:43.42]I'm so excited.
[08:44.18]It's because we've been blue ballsing the game up until now.
[08:48.30]We've done all the boring parts.
[08:50.05]Now it's time for the fun part.
[09:00.56]By the way, in case anybody is curious, I'm using the gunbow, the heavy gunbow.
[09:07.64]That's my weapon of choice.
[09:08.90]And Etalyx, what is your weapon of choice?
[09:11.02]My weapon is also a gun, but it is a gun with a sword on it.
[09:14.54]So, I'm using the gun lance.
[09:17.37]Figured we'd do a little bit of firepower here, you know what I mean?
[09:21.49]Overreacting.
[09:23.28]Am I, though?
[09:24.42]This game's been in development for like 16 years.
[09:26.58]I'm gonna get this out of the way.
[09:30.10]Alright.
[09:31.12]We're here on the same quest to hunt the Great Jagras.
[09:35.22]It works.
[09:36.34]This says we need friends.
[09:37.92]Alright, what do you got for items?
[09:39.78]Well, if we need friends, then we probably shouldn't play this game.
[09:42.60]I know, really.
[09:43.62]Also, you have to share those items with me.
[09:46.42]I do.
[09:47.22]Well, I can't even take some of these anyways.
[09:51.86]Alright, I think we're good.
[09:52.70]These are just free items.
[09:54.92]What about ammo?
[09:55.90]I've got plenty of ammo, alright?
[09:58.30]Well, I... Okay, this is what I have.
[10:02.12]Which is the box?
[10:04.22]Didn't fucking prepare for this, did I?
[10:06.30]No, I'm good.
[10:06.88]Okay.
[10:07.88]Normal ammo is my normal ammo 2.
[10:10.64]I'm ready to go.
[10:11.14]Let's go hunt the great jaguar.
[10:16.61]I am prepared.
[10:20.22]Hammer's the best weapon.
[10:21.02]If you don't use the hammer, you are trash and need new goals in life.
[10:25.84]Actually, the hammer was my other weapon that I wanted to use.
[10:28.78]See, some people are joking, but some people are not.
[10:33.56]I wanted to use... Look, there'll be plenty of things that you guys can make references to.
[10:38.66]Actually, our cats come with us, don't they?
[10:40.94]We don't get just a waypoint this time.
[10:42.66]We actually have to hunt the great jaguars.
[10:45.07]What do you think we had to do?
[10:46.97]The game's going to get handed to us?
[10:48.99]Open up your map.
[10:50.09]Let's not go this way.
[10:51.05]That looks like a dead end.
[10:52.09]No, let's go over to two.
[10:55.69]I would assume he's probably somewhere.
[10:57.39]By the way, we only have 48 minutes.
[10:59.85]Wait, I found him.
[11:00.75]Wait, what do you mean you found him?
[11:02.43]I found him.
[11:03.05]You've already found him?
[11:03.89]He's right here.
[11:04.51]Yeah, he's just feasting, you know?
[11:06.59]He's at Golden Corral right now, and he's going back for seconds.
[11:09.40]Oh.
[11:11.08]He's currently at the buffet.
[11:12.28]Where is he?
[11:13.24]He's waddling away.
[11:14.66]Oh, there he is.
[11:15.00]He just got done at the chocolate fountain.
[11:16.50]Oh, track him, track him.
[11:17.22]We're going to go after this guy.
[11:20.14]I got footprints.
[11:22.12]Just follow him.
[11:23.08]This is just like the joke monster.
[11:24.60]Let's kill the joke monster.
[11:25.70]Yeah, but you gotta pick up the footprints so that you can learn how to track monsters.
[11:29.28]It's like a real hunter.
[11:31.00]I got more footprints.
[11:32.20]I'm looking at it.
[11:34.08]This is on PS4.
[11:35.68]This is gonna be on PC eventually.
[11:38.32]But who knows when.
[11:39.04]It's also on Xbox, but let's be honest.
[11:41.17]Nobody plays on Xbox.
[11:43.01]This is not a console war.
[11:44.81]Skid marks.
[11:45.90]We got his dirty underwear over here.
[11:47.38]Let's take a look at it.
[11:49.40]It's saying you can go that way.
[11:52.78]We already saw the way he went.
[11:55.02]We did see the way he went, but what if he's not there?
[11:58.28]What if he's up in the trees?
[12:00.51]You think he can fly?
[12:01.69]He can't fly.
[12:02.41]We have enough tracking.
[12:04.65]Those flies are going to show us where he is.
[12:10.65]So let's just be careful here, though, because you never know.
[12:12.77]He could be anywhere.
[12:15.39]Make sure you pick up all the items.
[12:18.21]Gather all the berries.
[12:19.03]We've got to craft.
[12:19.99]I'm maxed on needle berries.
[12:22.29]He did the thing where, like, the dog drags his ass on the carpet.
[12:25.11]Alright, we've got to go this way.
[12:26.53]Apparently he's down here.
[12:28.57]See?
[12:29.49]We might have gone the wrong way if we didn't pick up that little cent.
[12:32.16]No, wait.
[12:32.60]Watch out for the crystals.
[12:33.94]Do we share this?
[12:36.68]You can have it.
[12:37.38]You can train mining.
[12:38.72]I'll train skinning.
[12:41.78]Alright, so he's apparently over here.
[12:43.72]Also going to do some fishing later.
[12:45.64]Yeah, you do have to.
[12:46.38]You can fish.
[12:47.00]That's true.
[12:48.04]D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D. He's just right here.
[12:52.73]Okay.
[12:54.11]He's just right here.
[12:54.75]I'm just going in first.
[12:55.73]I have my gun out.
[12:56.95]I'm just going to shoot him in the head.
[12:57.93]I think he might see me.
[12:59.25]Well, he doesn't see me yet.
[13:00.27]I'm hiding in the bushes.
[13:00.93]He's about to actually step on me in a moment.
[13:02.89]No, no, no, no, no.
[13:03.45]Don't let him go.
[13:04.35]This is where we fight.
[13:05.57]I got my piercing ammo.
[13:06.79]Engage.
[13:07.07]He's going in.
[13:10.63]Alright, I gotta get closer because I'm slow.
[13:14.13]Oh, he's angry.
[13:14.77]He's angry at me?
[13:16.17]He's angry at me.
[13:19.15]I'm gonna use his normal ammo here.
[13:20.32]Ooh.
[13:21.34]Alright.
[13:22.44]You know what?
[13:22.96]Are you ready?
[13:23.34]Line him up.
[13:23.72]Oh, yeah, yeah!
[13:25.84]Line him up.
[13:26.16]Here we go.
[13:26.80]Special move.
[13:27.38]Activate.
[13:27.70]I'm going with the machine gun.
[13:31.88]Alright, he's getting a little threatened.
[13:33.08]Oh, goddammit.
[13:35.52]As soon as you start unloading, he's gone.
[13:37.43]Oh, come on.
[13:37.95]It's alright.
[13:38.33]It's alright.
[13:38.81]Put it away.
[13:39.35]Alright, he's getting stuck.
[13:41.75]Put it away and run.
[13:43.73]He's over here.
[13:44.19]Put the damn gun away.
[13:46.02]There's some really dramatic music going with this, too.
[13:51.48]Like some Disney dramatic music.
[13:53.28]I, like, activated my special move.
[13:55.02]Alright, we're good.
[13:56.76]Here we go.
[13:58.94]He's awakening some babies.
[14:03.15]His children are coming to fight.
[14:04.69]Cut his tail off, Etalyx.
[14:06.15]That's what everybody says to do in these games.
[14:08.37]Alright, yeah, I'll get babies.
[14:10.56]I'll do some piercing shots on these babies.
[14:12.84]Alright, you take care of the boss.
[14:14.28]I'll cover your back.
[14:15.28]I think our small kittens are currently taking care of the boss.
[14:18.54]Well, look, I pretty much... I am a small... I am a small kitten, dude.
[14:26.29]What the fuck, dude?
[14:27.23]Why does he hate me so much?
[14:28.89]I didn't do anything.
[14:29.69]He's gonna eat me.
[14:31.90]Don't worry, I'll be over there in just a moment.
[14:33.22]Okay, he really is, like, eating me.
[14:34.44]I gotta run.
[14:37.69]Just, like, face planted.
[14:38.97]Alright, what about, like, Wyatt?
[14:41.25]No.
[14:41.57]Okay, are you ready?
[14:43.03]Load him up.
[14:44.29]Ooh, getting some good blocks in here.
[14:46.45]I'm a little stuck.
[14:47.51]He might eat me next.
[14:49.27]Let's just try one of these.
[14:50.39]I have one shot in this.
[14:51.31]Oh, shit!
[14:56.73]Okay, that was fucking cool.
[14:58.66]That was cool.
[14:59.30]I'm gonna do that again.
[15:00.42]That was really cool.
[15:01.24]What was that?
[15:02.12]It's one of these babies.
[15:03.14]I probably shouldn't be wasting those.
[15:08.82]Alright, get him in range.
[15:10.73]I'm gonna unload on him.
[15:16.97]Is he done?
[15:17.33]I don't know.
[15:19.23]He's staggered.
[15:21.05]Getting some good shots off.
[15:22.46]Good, good, good.
[15:26.18]What am I doing?
[15:27.30]What is this?
[15:28.88]Almost got him on the pin.
[15:30.14]Alright, that's a cluster bomb.
[15:32.48]He's really mad.
[15:33.14]He's really mad.
[15:34.44]Yeah, he is really mad.
[15:38.59]Why burn him?
[15:39.99]I think so.
[15:41.41]He's running away again.
[15:42.19]Alright, track him.
[15:43.35]Wait, skin this guy.
[15:44.67]I like this Evolve sequel so far.
[15:47.06]This really is Evolve, but there's nobody playing the monster.
[15:49.76]Alright, you just keep tracking him.
[15:50.96]I want to get some stuff.
[15:52.82]So what, you're going to take all the loot while I do all the work?
[15:55.28]I can trade it to you.
[15:56.76]It's too late.
[15:57.16]You're right.
[15:57.44]We've got to go.
[16:01.30]I'm on his tail.
[16:02.62]Not really.
[16:03.12]I think you can get on his tail, though.
[16:08.39]It's just like in Dark Souls.
[16:09.39]You're supposed to cut everybody's tail off.
[16:13.97]Eventually you're going to use it.
[16:16.48]What are you using for a weapon again?
[16:17.46]I'm using the gun lance.
[16:20.68]Alright.
[16:20.98]I'm coming in.
[16:21.38]I'll close for it.
[16:23.66]I definitely was blocking that.
[16:24.96]Some of this ammo, I didn't even realize how the hell to use it.
[16:27.18]I don't even know what this does.
[16:30.22]It looks like you stuck him with a firework.
[16:34.94]I guess.
[16:35.32]I'm going to use a cluster bomb.
[16:37.28]Just, like, watch out for a second.
[16:39.02]Alright.
[16:39.38]Get some tail hits on there.
[16:41.89]Looks like our kittens are, like, actually tanks.
[16:45.27]Like, accidentally, that was, like, the best thing I could have done.
[16:49.53]He's, like, in trouble.
[16:50.81]Can you get on his back?
[16:51.57]I don't know.
[16:53.43]Can you?
[16:54.43]I mean, I don't think so.
[16:56.51]He's tired.
[16:58.09]He's tired.
[16:59.07]Chase after him.
[17:00.01]Maybe we can jump on his back.
[17:01.15]How do you climb?
[17:01.76]I don't know, but I accidentally just did a really good thing with that bomb.
[17:04.80]That was fun.
[17:08.52]Damn it.
[17:08.88]That was fucking cool.
[17:09.82]That was really cool.
[17:12.84]Is he, like, trying to feast to heal himself?
[17:16.90]What are you fucking looking at?
[17:22.52]These people are innocent.
[17:23.33]What am I doing?
[17:24.73]Are you just hitting, like, the random side dinosaurs instead of this guy?
[17:28.09]Yes.
[17:28.87]Is there a problem with that?
[17:30.13]He's turning into a frog.
[17:31.19]Oh, God.
[17:31.59]He really is.
[17:32.17]I'm going to shoot him right in his frog sack.
[17:34.11]Alright.
[17:35.38]I'm tying him around.
[17:37.66]His frog sack.
[17:40.00]There we go.
[17:40.44]That's a lot of eights and tens.
[17:47.17]He's good.
[17:47.99]How are you on health?
[17:49.39]I'm doing good.
[17:50.41]I got a big shield, so that's pretty helpful.
[17:57.68]Monster Hunter.
[18:01.22]He's coming back for another pass.
[18:03.92]What else we got here?
[18:04.68]I'm going to shoot him.
[18:05.82]I still take damage with that.
[18:07.14]I just don't take as much.
[18:10.57]Here we go.
[18:11.01]I'm aiming right down his throat.
[18:14.28]I can't even see how much damage that does.
[18:20.06]Look, it's a frog.
[18:20.86]It's a frogwana, okay?
[18:22.06]It's not just an iguana.
[18:22.98]It's a frogwana.
[18:23.68]Dude, that hurts him a lot.
[18:25.70]This wyvern ammo is sick.
[18:31.14]I feel like our cats make this easy mode.
[18:33.48]We should play without the cats.
[18:34.38]Yeah, no cats.
[18:35.08]Get these cats out of here.
[18:36.70]They, like, heal you.
[18:37.75]They tank for you.
[18:40.61]Keep going.
[18:42.35]How can I, like, climb on it?
[18:44.17]If he gets away... I can pick up a stone.
[18:47.87]They can actually heal if they get away.
[18:50.74]They start to lick their wounds.
[18:51.74]From what I remember, though... I'm a little winded right now.
[18:55.64]I'm going to see if I can, like, jump on him.
[18:58.56]No, I can't.
[19:01.89]Oh wow, I really am winded.
[19:03.19]Oh shit, if you're winded, eat your meat.
[19:06.14]Eat your meat.
[19:06.70]Just eat your meat and you'll get an instant explosion of... What, the ration?
[19:12.66]Yeah, the ration fills your stamina.
[19:16.00]I can make a barbecue spit, I don't think that's what we want.
[19:18.20]No.
[19:18.36]Did I not pick any easy rations?
[19:19.84]I don't think you want to do a barbecue spit.
[19:22.57]I just want to do a cookout right now, you know?
[19:24.21]Come here.
[19:26.79]Here we go.
[19:29.53]That was a good one.
[19:32.95]Sticky ammo.
[19:33.55]It puts a fire... It puts a candle.
[19:37.14]It turns him into a birthday cake.
[19:40.18]Turns him into a kobold.
[19:41.66]There's so many different ammo types.
[19:43.06]I don't even know what the hell I even want to do here.
[19:49.82]You can just stick them with these.
[19:51.63]There it is.
[19:53.29]Now I got a cupcake following me.
[19:54.47]That was probably a mistake.
[20:00.01]I like the slicing ammo, too.
[20:01.45]Why is he, like, running through the wall?
[20:05.34]What was that?
[20:07.00]I don't know, but I'm blind now.
[20:10.14]Uh-oh.
[20:11.40]I think my weapon needs to, like... Cluster bomb.
[20:13.80]It's probably dull.
[20:15.32]Oh, he's gonna run.
[20:15.96]I'm gonna go use a whetstone real quick.
[20:18.76]Yeah, I don't even have sharpness, do I?
[20:20.50]I'm not even... That's pretty goofy.
[20:23.60]Here we go.
[20:23.98]Let's set up a trap here.
[20:24.80]He's just a little dog, man.
[20:26.14]We're killing, like, a big lizard dog.
[20:29.15]And... Got ya.
[20:32.01]Rain hell.
[20:33.25]I think he's just trying to kill the cats only.
[20:36.97]Yeah, the cats make this real easy, huh?
[20:39.65]Dead.
[20:43.03]Game is eSports.
[20:47.26]Make sure... Alright, so how do we like... How do we share the loot here?
[20:50.32]I got the ceiling.
[20:53.18]Alright, if I skin this, what happens?
[20:55.08]Do you get this too?
[20:55.78]Um...
[21:01.77]Let's find out.
[21:02.29]I'll skin it first.
[21:02.99]But we'll do it at the same time.
[21:04.73]We'll do it at the exact same time.
[21:09.24]There's no reason why we wouldn't be able to both get it.
[21:12.30]Can you do it again?
[21:13.26]Great Jagras scale.
[21:14.36]Great Jagras scale.
[21:15.54]So these are crafting materials to upgrade gear.
[21:18.32]By the way, this was just a little chump enemy.
[21:20.96]Yeah, this is the tutorial boss.
[21:25.70]We just want to make sure we were in the right spot.
[21:27.20]Can you do it again?
[21:28.12]Are these guys still hostile?
[21:29.42]Or since we killed, like, the mom, do they care?
[21:31.20]I don't think they care anymore.
[21:33.64]So we should kill them anyway.
[21:34.70]We each get the same number of cards.
[21:35.88]Oh, we're about to go home anyway.
[21:37.34]I'm sorry.
[21:37.76]I'll just, like, shotgun them in the head.
[21:39.44]No, never mind.
[21:43.08]Quest complete.
[21:43.72]Alright.
[21:44.44]So we made sure to get to, like, the tutorial boss.
[21:47.90]Yes.
[21:48.06]So we weren't going to put you through the pain of us doing the same, like, opening cutscene you may have seen probably, like, a hundred times.
[21:54.92]Unless you've seen this one a hundred times, in which case, tough luck.
[21:57.94]In which case, at least we're a step ahead.
[22:03.68]That was cool, though.
[22:04.50]That was very cool.
[22:11.90]Thank you, too.
[22:13.12]Some bits came in there.
[22:13.88]Niall, thank you, Niall, for the $1.
[22:15.54]Can't catch up on the VOD because you keep going live when I watch them.
[22:20.79]I'm sorry.
[22:21.37]Marvash Magali.
[22:23.97]Thanks for the $1.
[22:24.69]Hi, Jerma.
[22:25.03]Thanks for everything you do.
[22:26.23]Cheers from Italy.
[22:26.97]Keep up the great work.
[22:27.65]Thanks a lot, man.
[22:29.09]Appreciate that.
[22:29.93]As we're investigating the ooze.
[22:33.95]Kyle99.
[22:34.61]Thanks for the $1.
[22:35.43]Yay, birthday stream.
[22:36.73]Whoa, that is a funky monster.
[22:40.01]That's a pukey pukey.
[22:43.47]Are you ready to track the pukey pukey?
[22:44.89]Looks like we're going to have lots of fun there.
[22:49.11]But thank you...
[22:52.01]Do we have to fight this right now?
[22:56.05]It's just The Last Guardian.
[22:57.69]Yeah, it's Trico.
[23:01.83]They just painted him a different color.
[23:05.05]Thank you, though.
[23:05.63]Happy birthday, Kyle.
[23:07.97]Sir Limesalot, thanks for the $5.
[23:09.84]Celebrating my 20th birthday in two days, and I watched you since my 15th birthday.
[23:14.48]Jesus.
[23:15.04]That's five years.
[23:17.38]You were always that laid-back dude, and I hope you still stay like that.
[23:21.31]Thanks a lot, Sarah Limes, a lot.
[23:23.97]I don't plan on making any changes, so hopefully I can not change.
[23:32.84]I hope I'm the same person that I was.
[23:34.94]Although that's, like, hard to say that because people do, like, change eventually, you know what I mean?
[23:42.12]Sending all these to the item boxes.
[23:45.98]Bonus reward.
[23:46.74]Great Dragr's Mane.
[23:49.46]Obtained by breaking its head.
[23:52.19]So we broke his head.
[23:53.79]Cool.
[23:55.41]But I don't want to be one of those people that changes too crazily.
[23:59.07]I mean, obviously, when you get older, you do end up changing.
[24:02.32]Because you just get older.
[24:07.66]So the more you kill things, the more research you get.
[24:09.58]I don't know if I understand.
[24:13.87]I don't know.
[24:14.37]I don't think I'm going to be the same person when I'm 50 that I am when I'm, you know, like, now, like, my early 30s.
[24:22.25]Yeah, like, I've lost hair, for instance.
[24:23.71]That's true.
[24:25.89]But thank you, nonetheless.
[24:26.65]Thanks for the $5, dude.
[24:27.51]Thank you also to Smokewise Ganja for the $5.
[24:30.61]Acid base is required.
[24:32.03]Please have it ready.
[24:32.83]Oh, absolutely not.
[24:37.73]The more things you kill, the more you age.
[24:42.49]what the fuck uh thank you smoke wise uh campy movie 99 thanks for the six dollars Jerma this is my first time giving bits but I've been a fan for four years you rock thank you campy I see much appreciated thank you for your first time ever giving bits it's never necessary
[25:07.40]You've been watching for four years.
[25:08.58]That's plenty for me.
[25:10.82]Pukey Pukey territory that's pretty deep in the forest will be better equipped to take it on.
[25:16.48]Once our team from the resource center is done rebuilding the forest camp, once it's ready, we make our move.
[25:20.46]Until then, we do everything we can to help them get the camp up and running.
[25:23.51]Let's get to it.
[25:26.23]So... Oh, it's much better if his name's Pukey Pukey.
[25:29.51]That's so much better.
[25:35.47]Acer, Acer Decilisos, thanks for the five bucks.
[25:37.94]I do not know the command D. Would you like to teach it to me?
[25:43.62]Yeah, open up a command property, press D. And it opens up your D drive, which is your CD drive, usually.
[25:48.90]Sometimes.
[25:50.28]And Dennis999999, thanks for the three dollars.
[25:54.06]The new meta is to put pineapple on pancakes.
[25:57.42]No, don't do that.
[25:59.80]Let's find out where Etalyx is.
[26:01.46]Thank you guys, though.
[26:03.37]Alright, Alex, what's happening here?
[26:05.27]Where are you?
[26:06.53]I was talking to Chet, and I am in the game world now.
[26:11.55]I'm talking to the commander who has an exclamation point over his head.
[26:16.68]Just in case it's a quest, but I think it's just because he wants to say something.
[26:19.80]You're talking to Mr. Commander?
[26:21.24]Yes.
[26:22.16]Are you talking to Mr. Commander?
[26:23.42]We should just do the exact same shit, because if we don't, then maybe it'll screw something up.
[26:30.47]uh I think we just keep meeting back in the gathering point you want to keep doing that do stuff speak to well we got to speak to certain people first right like the provisions manager pre-recorded Etalyx yeah this you're we took so much time he he's he's recorded look like 50 000 yeah 50 000 lines it's taken him like four years to make this uh this file
[26:55.47]I'm just the newest Amazon artificial intelligence.
[26:59.14]How do we keep our cats at home?
[27:01.34]There's an option when you're starting a quest, I think, to make them stay out.
[27:06.77]Okay.
[27:07.09]Let's do that.
[27:08.51]First, we got to talk to a couple of tutorial people.
[27:11.08]Yeah, I see this provisions manager.
[27:13.62]Why do the people in this game keep referring to me as Fiverr?
[27:17.30]As if I am some cheap online internet service that you can just pay $5 to go kill monsters?
[27:24.32]Hey, maybe I could make you have a news background.
[27:27.18]Maybe I could make you have a green-screened background where you say a testimonial for me.
[27:33.88]Let's just get this over with.
[27:35.58]Resource manager.
[27:38.56]Alright, so I think they're about to send us on an expedition, which is like the free room area.
[27:42.67]Okay.
[27:45.63]And we're going to have to find a campsite.
[27:48.87]Maintaining and improving the base.
[27:49.91]Do you have to base build here?
[27:51.49]I don't think it's a base build so much as it is there's a campsite here, but monsters are guarding it, so kill the monsters, unlock the camp.
[27:58.77]You are so smart.
[28:02.57]That came off like really condescending.
[28:03.63]That's not what I meant.
[28:05.05]You are like so smart.
[28:05.83]I didn't mean that as condescending.
[28:10.03]It pisses me off how smart you are.
[28:13.00]So the bounties, new critical bounties available.
[28:15.24]Rebuild the ancient forest camp.
[28:17.66]Secure the campsite.
[28:18.42]You want to do this?
[28:19.84]We get a voucher.
[28:26.34]Rude.
[28:26.80]I'm sorry.
[28:30.16]Alright.
[28:30.66]Are you with the bounty girl?
[28:33.00]Look, this game is like four hours of tutorials.
[28:36.09]It's just the offline MMO.
[28:38.84]We tried to make it so the boring parts were not going to be on stream, but none of it's boring.
[28:44.37]There's a lot of content here.
[28:45.73]This is like a full to the brim $60 game.
[28:49.85]This game is so full.
[28:51.99]You know when you pour a glass of soda, water, whatever, and it gets all the way to the top, and you're afraid.
[28:58.35]Yeah, but then you find out it was like 50% foam, and the actual content is only like half the glass.
[29:03.33]No, no, you fill all the way up, but you're afraid to pick it up.
[29:06.32]Because you don't, like, if it gets right to the brim and you pick it up a little too, it'll spill a little.
[29:10.74]So you have to, like, lean in and do, like, that bird thing.
[29:13.30]You know the bird thing that's outside that leans forward and puts its face?
[29:16.02]The bird thing?
[29:16.62]Yeah, it puts its face in the water.
[29:17.84]It's, like, a stupid thing that was in everybody's classroom, that stupid bird drinker.
[29:21.64]The thing that had weight in its back and it, like, dunked its face in the water.
[29:24.48]You have to do that before you can even move on.
[29:27.32]So we have to bird dunk for, like, at least another 40 minutes before we're able to drink that water.
[29:34.28]So we have to be in your classroom for about four or five years.
[29:37.08]The good news is we only have one thing we can... Well, never mind.
[29:41.54]There's more than one thing.
[29:44.15]Okay, so are you at the resource center with the register bounties, girl?
[29:47.33]Yeah, I'm about to read this because it's brand new information for me.
[29:50.29]I kind of skipped over it, but I think you should read it.
[29:53.77]The Resource Center oversees researcher requests and manages the resources required for their investigations.
[29:57.97]To do bounties, you need to register beforehand, whereas delivery requests can be completed just by handing in items.
[30:17.06]Alright, here's the TL;DR.
[30:19.18]If you get a bunch of collectibles, you can just turn in the collectibles for XP.
[30:23.98]But some of these missions, you have to purposefully say, I want to do this mission before you can count it as a complete mission.
[30:32.49]Alright, so register bounties.
[30:34.88]Yeah, so if you register a bounty, that's like saying, I aim to complete this mission.
[30:39.44]Whereas you can also like gather up supplies and take them back just for XP randomly.
[30:43.76]Oh boy, this is like a book.
[30:45.32]Okay, critical bounties.
[30:46.58]Alright, let's just take one registered bounty and then the critical one is like our mission.
[30:51.33]Alright, we're going to register a bounty.
[30:53.75]Which one do you want to do?
[30:56.29]Mine six times.
[30:57.55]Right, that was easy.
[30:58.43]Mining outcrops.
[30:59.33]Okay, like honey.
[31:00.41]Like gather honey three times.
[31:01.87]We can queue up as many of these as we want.
[31:03.51]Oh, okay.
[31:04.86]Or at least like six.
[31:06.60]You have six slots on the left.
[31:07.84]Just do them all.
[31:08.50]Yeah, just do them all.
[31:10.54]Okay, so flora.
[31:11.56]I mean, there are only six here.
[31:13.34]So just take them all.
[31:15.18]This is like the tutorial you're an idiot type of content.
[31:19.00]So that eventually we're going to have more than we can actually take.
[31:22.37]Yeah, that makes sense.
[31:24.93]Book equals two paragraphs of text.
[31:26.95]No, it's just, it's a book, okay?
[31:29.07]It's a book.
[31:29.71]This is only page two.
[31:30.99]This is page two.
[31:32.10]You guys didn't read the rest of the book.
[31:33.38]I opened up the book.
[31:35.08]I opened up the book to the midway point.
[31:36.14]We started at, like, chapter two or three at this point.
[31:40.56]Okay, so what about the critical ones?
[31:43.06]I think the critical ones we don't have to, like, accept.
[31:45.36]I think that's just a mission.
[31:46.24]It's just there.
[31:46.88]Okay.
[31:48.50]So, um... Find the campsite in the ancient forest is what it wants us to do now.
[31:54.21]So we want to come back up to the... We can turn around and the gate is right here.
[31:58.57]Can we just queue up here?
[32:01.34]Let's find out.
[32:03.20]I just... Okay.
[32:03.90]Depart on Expedition.
[32:04.86]This is a pretty big world map.
[32:06.32]This is pretty large.
[32:07.10]Ancient Forest.
[32:07.42]There's a lot of stuff here.
[32:08.24]It's a pretty good incentive.
[32:09.57]Alright.
[32:09.91]So, monsters.
[32:10.63]Flourish.
[32:11.01]Gathering points.
[32:11.37]Great.
[32:11.49]Jagras.
[32:11.87]Anjanath.
[32:12.17]Alright.
[32:12.61]Well, I just departed on the Expedition.
[32:13.91]Let me see if I can Shanghai you into my Expedition.
[32:35.95]It's kind of weird we can't see each other in just the regular world.
[32:38.67]Make a new YouTube channel where you just explain tutorials.
[32:43.07]That would be terrible.
[32:45.98]If you were just the tutorial guy... If you were the tutorial guy, why would your channel exist?
[32:52.72]Somebody could just turn the game on and just see all of your content in the first 10-20 minutes to like an hour of every video game.
[33:00.49]What are you bringing to the table?
[33:02.39]Hey, what's going on guys?
[33:03.25]It's the tutorial guy here!
[33:05.51]with a brand new video.
[33:06.67]As you see, I'm doing the first 12 minutes of Monster Hunter.
[33:11.17]You would get this exact same content if you just opened the game yourself.
[33:14.73]Alright, see you later.
[33:15.77]That was the tutorial.
[33:18.83]You bring charm.
[33:19.63]Alright, I'm almost done loading.
[33:22.23]Alright, you're almost done loading.
[33:25.09]Then you can load, hopefully.
[33:27.71]I probably have to send like an SOS out to you.
[33:31.50]I wonder what happens if I just go there.
[33:34.03]I don't think we're going to be in the same one, so you might want to wait so you don't do the GTA V thing where you have to reload the world three times.
[33:40.26]Don't reload the world.
[33:41.94]Alright, well, in the meantime, I'm going to go, like, talk to some fucking people.
[33:46.02]Well, I just got here, so I'm going to fire an SOS.
[33:48.77]Fire an SOS.
[33:50.21]And then I can open up my SOS device, right?
[33:54.21]Is there a way I can, like, study the SOS?
[34:02.42]He says you cannot use this right now.
[34:05.77]Okay.
[34:07.45]So, what if we just go to... I'm just going to go... Maybe we should just go to the meeting area.
[34:10.45]Yeah, go to the hub zone thing.
[34:12.59]Let's just get over there.
[34:16.05]I think that's a better idea.
[34:16.79]Expedition complete.
[34:18.19]You did it.
[34:18.55]Yeah, I did it.
[34:19.65]Congratulations.
[34:20.35]We did good, guys.
[34:21.87]I'm going to go over there.
[34:23.25]Left is straight up.
[34:29.64]I'm going to go all the way around here.
[34:32.56]I'm gonna eat something, too.
[34:33.50]No, actually, the cook is over there inside the... I think we're supposed to, like, eat something in the camp whenever we go on a mission.
[34:40.94]Okay.
[34:42.32]But we can also eat stuff back in town.
[34:44.36]I don't know.
[34:46.65]Unpredictable platter.
[34:48.09]There, you get buffs for eating food.
[34:49.49]And give me one second.
[34:53.67]Ben just gave 50 bucks.
[34:56.65]It's been three stinking days.
[34:58.67]It hasn't been that long.
[35:01.35]We're the tutorial guys, right?
[35:03.15]That's like what they call us.
[35:05.21]But thank you so much, Ben, for the 50 bucks.
[35:08.09]That's a lot of money.
[35:09.48]You've given money.
[35:10.20]You've given money.
[35:11.08]You know what somebody's talking about?
[35:13.30]Like, oh, yeah, you know, I gave some money.
[35:16.86]Money.
[35:17.64]Like money.
[35:19.72]Money.
[35:21.06]Not just money.
[35:22.50]That's a lot, man.
[35:24.90]You're up to like...
[35:28.35]In total, I don't even know.
[35:29.71]I can't even give a number because I'm not even sure what it is.
[35:32.69]It's definitely more than, it's definitely more than like 30 bucks.
[35:36.31]Because you just gave 50.
[35:42.22]We've got to have money.
[35:48.16]Alright.
[35:52.21]Ben pays my rent.
[35:59.23]Where did the talics go?
[36:01.53]But thank you so much, dude.
[36:02.59]Thank you also to Alezzo Genova for the five bucks.
[36:05.83]Can't we rewind and save some memes?
[36:07.50]You killed your own children, you monster.
[36:09.36]Not yet.
[36:09.68]That's on February 1st.
[36:12.18]Thank you, though, dude.
[36:12.74]Thank you, Pin, for the $1.
[36:13.84]You told me to eat more healthy foods to deal with my ADHD symptoms.
[36:17.62]Now that I don't take any medication, what do you recommend?
[36:21.00]Salmon.
[36:22.06]Fish.
[36:23.02]Good fish.
[36:23.56]Fatty fish.
[36:24.70]Omega-3s.
[36:25.60]Brain food.
[36:26.98]Eat it up.
[36:30.23]Alright, you ready to queue us up for something?
[36:34.03]I will attempt to.
[36:35.47]Attempt to queue us up for literally anything.
[36:36.97]Post a new quest, and then I can do expedition.
[36:39.80]I can do events.
[36:43.08]Yeah, if I lose you, I can just bring in the soundboard.
[36:45.22]That's true.
[36:47.12]So can I just join a quest?
[36:49.06]Alright, we have no assigned missions.
[36:51.08]We have... Okay.
[36:55.22]Healthful.
[36:55.99]Apparently I did not do fungal flexing, so we don't have to do that right now.
[37:01.37]I don't know how to do an expedition from here.
[37:04.73]Well, we don't have to do an expedition right now.
[37:06.05]I think maybe we go up here.
[37:07.15]Oh, wait a minute.
[37:09.45]Let's see what this is.
[37:10.49]Depart on expedition.
[37:11.52]You want to just do it?
[37:12.82]Alright, but can you come with me?
[37:17.20]I have a marker over here.
[37:18.50]Find the campsite in the ancient forest.
[37:20.00]I think this is just depart on expedition.
[37:23.62]I have a bad feeling about this.
[37:24.98]Well, we might just have to do this on our own.
[37:29.99]Hold on.
[37:33.50]Okay, so...
[37:35.00]Yeah if the mission has a cutscene you have to see the cutscene first, then fire S.O.S.
[37:40.00]Alright, so we can do the S.O.S like afterwards.
[37:43.00]Alright so let's just just go here.
[37:45.00]So I'm gonna load again, hopefully it remembered how fast we loaded last time.
[37:48.00]Well, while you do that I need to like make ammo because I don't have any. I forgot that's gonna be- that's gonna be a thing.
[37:54.00]Uh, isn't that gonna be a thing?
[37:55.00]Crafting game.
[37:57.00]So good to see you.
[37:58.00]What are you buying? What are you selling? Oh, buy- sell- I don't know. Which one?
[38:02.85]Alright, well, you just hang out there.
[38:06.43]So I can make ammo.
[38:08.49]Yeah.
[38:09.47]So whenever you use cool ammo, you're going to have to make it.
[38:12.72]I know.
[38:13.02]Shit, I've been just going through it all.
[38:14.64]Look at those pretty colors.
[38:15.90]I've been just wasting ammo.
[38:18.74]Crafting list.
[38:19.30]Let's see.
[38:22.29]Have I been wasting my cool ammunition?
[38:25.14]Recover ammo.
[38:25.84]You've been using the artillery shots, like the sniper rounds, like the poison, armor piercing.
[38:32.94]Poison.
[38:33.66]Oh, wow, yeah.
[38:35.62]I need Feralis' blast coating.
[38:40.97]I can make spread ammo.
[38:41.97]I need needle berries.
[38:47.35]Is there anything else I can do?
[38:48.29]Recover ammo.
[38:51.18]So I can shoot you and heal you.
[38:54.26]Let's make some of this, just for fun.
[38:56.66]Alright.
[38:57.40]Mount to craft.
[38:58.32]Let's make... Let's just make some.
[39:02.80]Just to have it.
[39:04.58]Why can't I use the SOS?
[39:07.76]How much do I have now?
[39:08.38]74.
[39:08.46]I already have 74.
[39:13.56]Gunpowder.
[39:14.70]Dangerous substance that explodes when struck.
[39:16.48]Okay, this is where it gets, like...
[39:18.99]You know, a little bit, like, you need to, like, just study what's happening here.
[39:24.25]Are you saying you need a book?
[39:26.37]Alright.
[39:27.15]So I need gunpowder level two to make some of these.
[39:30.93]Okay.
[39:31.45]You probably have to craft something that's level two.
[39:33.47]So gunpowder requires fire herb and nitro shrooms.
[39:38.60]With my same ammunition type for every single time I fire my gun lance.
[39:43.02]Sorry.
[39:43.54]It'll come to me.
[39:46.37]What's my, like, inventory?
[39:47.65]You sure you don't want to be, like, default hammer guy?
[39:51.26]I'm pretty sure.
[39:53.12]Well, if for some reason you want to change weapons, you can go to the room that is aboard the ship and change.
[39:59.90]No, this is alright.
[40:01.14]So, we can't... I'm just going to go do this expedition.
[40:04.26]Because I don't think we can... I'm just sitting, like, looking at a menu.
[40:07.82]This is probably, like, tutorial expedition.
[40:09.72]I'm just going.
[40:11.18]So, how about this?
[40:12.22]I'll see you on the flip side.
[40:15.52]Okay.
[40:15.92]I'll see you after we get to the new campsite.
[40:18.50]Yes.
[40:19.58]Okay.
[40:20.18]Bye-bye.
[40:22.00]See you later.
[40:23.24]Co-op stream?
[40:24.38]Don't think so.
[40:25.64]Not today.
[40:30.96]You ruined it.
[40:31.64]What do you mean I ruined it?
[40:35.56]How did I ruin it?
[40:38.76]This expedition.
[40:39.92]Watch this be like a four-hour long thing.
[40:47.24]This is going to be one of those things.
[40:48.36]Welcome to the expedition.
[40:49.89]Thank you.
[40:51.25]By the way, if you leave, you're going to get deserter for 35 minutes.
[40:56.77]It's a two hour long expedition.
[41:08.77]I'm excited though.
[41:09.25]I'm having fun.
[41:10.63]This is a fun game.
[41:11.41]Head to the new campsite.
[41:13.71]You can depart on an expedition by selecting a destination from the world map without first accepting a quest.
[41:19.91]Unlike quests, expeditions are very open-ended and are great if you want to freely explore the world.
[41:26.44]There's no time limit.
[41:27.58]You don't fail.
[41:29.10]There's no completion conditions.
[41:30.72]Monsters will depart the field after a set amount of time.
[41:34.18]You can kind of just... Okay.
[41:37.01]This is just teaching you what the hell this even is.
[41:41.38]You can decide when to return from an expedition once you're done exploring Return by doing one of the following.
[41:46.04]Speak to the Handler.
[41:47.48]Select Return from the menu.
[41:48.74]Select Astera from the world map.
[41:50.91]Okay.
[41:53.81]When you return to camp after completing a quest, you will automatically switch to an expedition.
[42:01.33]Alright.
[42:03.05]Learning.
[42:04.79]So, just head to the new campsite.
[42:08.19]I think I can handle that.
[42:10.38]If I get to the campsite first, or if you're lost, open up your... Oh, I thought he was going to say, like, the last one's a rotten egg.
[42:18.98]Just grill some raw meat up golden brown.
[42:20.60]It'll raise your stamina.
[42:22.86]Take it off the flame.
[42:23.74]Remember, don't let it burn.
[42:24.70]There's too many people talking to me.
[42:27.54]Like, is this guy over here... Got a guy talking... I got a tutorial inside of a tutorial.
[42:32.33]I'm trying to learn how to cook.
[42:34.93]And that guy's popping up on my mini screen.
[42:39.57]Alright, so return... No, I don't want to return.
[42:43.76]I'm going to head to the new campsite.
[42:44.82]Where's the new campsite?
[42:47.66]I thought that was the girl talking.
[42:48.86]Alright, is this the new campsite?
[42:50.00]No.
[42:51.16]Is this... What does it want me to do?
[43:04.01]Head to the new campsite.
[43:07.62]Isn't that what this is?
[43:11.32]Alright, let's just get shit-faced in here with the cat and nothing else.
[43:19.99]We have to complete the expedition.
[43:23.85]Can I open a quest counter?
[43:25.09]There's no real rush.
[43:28.99]As long as we're out here, we may as well have a good look around.
[43:33.65]We're just gonna go walk around, apparently.
[43:35.19]Wait, let me, like, go in here.
[43:37.48]There's no items in here.
[43:38.50]Great.
[43:39.82]Oh, I fucking came prepared to that one.
[43:41.48]Alright, well, this is an expedition.
[43:43.86]We're just gonna explore.
[43:44.66]And we're just gonna shoot stuff.
[43:48.22]We're gonna pick up some items.
[43:50.99]Speaking of, okay, I don't have, like, a mission to, like, collect a bunch of stuff.
[43:55.67]Yes, I do.
[43:58.75]I see lots of things on the map.
[44:02.16]Alright, don't fall down the drain.
[44:03.87]Old footprints.
[44:06.05]Where?
[44:07.77]Oh, down there.
[44:09.81]This is a great co-op stream.
[44:11.11]Alright, so there's apparently something here.
[44:14.95]Am I going to have to solo some kind of monster here?
[44:20.78]Need a few more to learn about it.
[44:22.32]Might as well just learn.
[44:25.08]Okay.
[44:27.84]Investigation added.
[44:30.39]Investigation added.
[44:31.97]Why do I sound like I've been drinking?
[44:35.64]Pet the cat.
[44:36.28]No, I'm not going to pet the cat.
[44:39.68]This cat is not my pet.
[44:41.68]He is a fellow friend.
[44:44.94]Skid marks.
[44:50.25]Okay.
[44:52.97]Aliens up there.
[44:54.57]There's a T-Rex over there.
[44:56.57]There's a T-Rex right there.
[45:01.20]Should I go... I think I'm gonna go after... Forget about Etalyx.
[45:03.68]We're going after the T-Rex without him.
[45:08.50]Right?
[45:08.74]I mean, like, look at it.
[45:09.30]It's right there.
[45:13.04]Should I fight this thing?
[45:13.90]This isn't gonna fight... This thing's gonna fight me.
[45:17.77]The monster's too dangerous.
[45:21.43]Um... Okay.
[45:25.71]I'm supposed to talk to Nat Pagle over here.
[45:28.88]Other members of the field team are on expeditions.
[45:31.57]No, I want to talk!
[45:46.22]Well... I fucking died instantly.
[45:49.36]He came... He came... Well, okay.
[45:57.59]That was cool.
[45:58.56]That was fucking awesome, actually.
[46:00.24]I'm, like, happy about that.
[46:02.10]It means it's a fucking challenge, mate.
[46:07.22]No, I want to... We have to go to the expedition.
[46:09.68]I don't... You know, go look at Italic's stream.
[46:12.50]Does he have a T-Rex on his camera?
[46:17.59]Why did I get the T-Rex spawn?
[46:20.61]I want to sneak.
[46:21.33]How am I supposed to get by this guy now?
[46:28.83]There's a person here I need to talk to.
[46:30.30]He's looking.
[46:31.58]Where is he?
[46:35.24]I'll find him.
[46:38.72]Fuck.
[46:39.78]I'm hiding in the bushes, man.
[46:41.02]I need to talk to this person that's over here.
[46:47.00]Hopefully my cat doesn't do anything stupid.
[46:51.86]Alright, we're good.
[46:54.43]I just need to go by.
[46:56.59]These things are not hostile.
[46:57.65]They're just dumb.
[46:59.86]Those are the stupid dinosaurs from Jurassic Park.
[47:04.07]Wait, I think I can get a... Come on, come on, come on.
[47:09.09]Hurry up.
[47:10.09]Doesn't take this long.
[47:11.31]Just smear it with your hand.
[47:15.88]Oh, God.
[47:16.26]Does he see me?
[47:17.94]Hope not.
[47:19.38]Oh, God.
[47:19.60]He's coming over here.
[47:21.00]Move, move, move, move.
[47:21.90]Don't have time for this.
[47:23.14]Hide in the tree.
[47:30.64]Okay, can I even... Oh, son of a bitch.
[47:37.05]Okay, please talk to me.
[47:39.91]Researcher, there we go.
[47:41.75]How's it hunting?
[47:43.21]Gotta say there's no better way to spend the day than fishing.
[47:46.38]I'm the lucky guy the commission has put in charge of studying fish.
[47:48.86]This is the guy that teaches you how to fish.
[47:53.14]Alright, I caught all the world's fish every last one.
[47:56.14]This just is Nat Fagel.
[47:58.45]My life here can't be all works.
[47:59.51]I've been looking for a chum who loves the lore as much as I do.
[48:04.17]What do you say, Hunter?
[48:06.00]Are you game?
[48:14.78]Am I game?
[48:15.94]I'm not sure.
[48:17.54]That's a good question.
[48:18.98]Let me think about it for a minute.
[48:20.60]In fact, let me sit here and think about this for a good, maybe like two to three minutes.
[48:26.17]Until he's no longer involved.
[48:32.35]He's currently... He's currently fighting.
[48:37.30]I just... Alright.
[48:39.46]Am I game?
[48:41.96]I want to say yes, but I can't.
[48:46.63]I can't say yes.
[48:49.36]I can't say yes.
[48:51.48]You know what happens if I say yes?
[48:56.72]Okay, let's see what you're made of.
[49:02.81]I can get away.
[49:03.95]I can get away.
[49:06.33]I'll show you what I'm made of.
[49:09.99]Oh no, my Meowth needs to recover his health.
[49:16.30]Okay.
[49:17.44]New campsite.
[49:20.12]Where's the new campsite?
[49:21.02]I need to find it.
[49:23.51]There's a great jaguar over there.
[49:28.03]If I was a campsite, where would I be?
[49:29.41]Over here?
[49:30.79]Maybe.
[49:31.09]I kind of want to just lure them together and have them fight each other.
[49:37.50]Might as well do this.
[49:45.00]Head to the new campsite.
[49:49.91]His sight's based on movement.
[49:51.51]That actually would be pretty funny.
[49:57.52]I guess I could just complete the expedition.
[49:59.18]What if I just complete it and just leave?
[50:00.52]I mean, can I just leave the expedition?
[50:09.38]Would that just complete it?
[50:13.80]Oh, I need to... I got some more field resources.
[50:15.08]I might just get one of these done, or two of them done at least.
[50:19.18]Wiggly Litchi.
[50:26.95]Footprints.
[50:28.69]More, more, more.
[50:32.37]Etalyx is so far ahead.
[50:33.31]Well, I got attacked by the... I don't even know what I'm supposed to be doing.
[50:36.32]I have to find the new campsite.
[50:48.05]Well, I got some more odd footprints Okay, we got like a pterodactyl man over here apparently Hi Or pterodactyl woman More information to fill my brain
[51:15.88]This thing about Monster Hunter games, you have to remember, like, the first six hours of Monster Hunter is please fill my brain with as much information as you... It's like downloading the fucking Matrix.
[51:27.43]It's just six straight hours of information.
[51:36.63]Become my assistant.
[51:38.51]Don't answer.
[51:39.01]Think it over.
[51:39.65]Come see me later.
[51:41.07]Come see me sometime.
[51:44.09]Okay.
[51:46.38]This is gonna have to be a seven-hour stream.
[51:51.88]I'm about to just shoot one of these fucking things.
[51:55.50]Alright, well, there's no... There's no campsite over here.
[52:01.54]Etalyx is on the last monster.
[52:04.21]Whoops.
[52:06.07]Oh, well, it's alright.
[52:07.69]Wait, no, that's not alright.
[52:09.13]That was just a stun grenade.
[52:13.61]No, this loser's over here.
[52:14.75]Okay.
[52:19.16]I think I did find it.
[52:21.52]Oh.
[52:23.23]Hey, found it.
[52:27.27]Found it.
[52:29.05]Found the campsite.
[52:32.83]Why are you telling me over here?
[52:33.65]I'm going to climb the vines.
[52:36.06]Hey!
[52:41.86]Look at that.
[52:46.70]Who's the greatest?
[52:47.62]Who's the greatest?
[52:48.12]Who's the greatest?
[52:50.46]Not me.
[52:54.59]Wait, this is treasure hunting dinosaurs?
[52:57.19]That's a Kulu Yakukulu.
[53:00.93]Oh, how majestic.
[53:02.13]Let's kill it.
[53:05.75]Oh, you made me shatter my favorite vase.
[53:07.49]No!
[53:12.75]Well, if we don't take care of that pest, the camp won't last the night.
[53:16.90]Mm-hmm.
[53:20.23]I wish I could move.
[53:21.73]Oh.
[53:22.09]Oh, yeah.
[53:23.41]Your scalp flies can guide you to monsters.
[53:26.49]Grimalkinds and gatherable items.
[53:29.71]Press that to open the map.
[53:31.39]Yep.
[53:31.83]Use the cursor to select the target you wish to seek.
[53:34.45]Then press R3 to place a pin.
[53:35.77]Okay, that's cool.
[53:37.46]You can just pinpoint stuff.
[53:40.44]During expeditions, simply collect monster tracks.
[53:43.26]Not engage your scalp lies guy to do so mix your use of pins.
[53:45.84]Give me like another six hours of information, please Bird brain Alright hot way now we have to hunt that thing Alright I'm ready Please don't kill it what we have to
[54:09.91]The name of the game is Monster Hunter, not Monster Friend.
[54:15.83]Well, he went over there, but we can't get up there.
[54:17.49]So I have to go around or something.
[54:20.17]Is there a way I can sneak around here?
[54:22.39]Maybe?
[54:24.58]I guess.
[54:32.82]Where is he?
[54:34.16]He just jumped off the cliff.
[54:35.58]Wait, what's that?
[54:39.45]Take this?
[54:39.95]Oh, goddammit.
[54:40.83]No, I thought I could steal it.
[54:46.53]Let's open up the map and see.
[54:48.89]Where is he?
[54:52.37]He's up here.
[54:54.78]Oh, Cuckoo.
[54:55.20]Alright.
[54:57.64]The Cuckoo Puffs bird is over here.
[55:00.90]He's right there.
[55:03.66]So.
[55:05.22]If I drop down... Is he hiding?
[55:07.56]Oh, he's coming down.
[55:10.46]Alright, here he comes.
[55:14.62]He really is like a Looney Tunes character.
[55:19.50]And... Hi there.
[55:28.34]Right in the head.
[55:32.47]I'm gonna take out the machine gun.
[55:34.49]We're going... We're going machine gun mode right now.
[55:36.65]You know what I say?
[55:37.11]That's when you just say, fucking pull up the fucking heavy weapons.
[55:47.65]Put it away.
[55:49.44]Put it away and run.
[55:50.20]Go!
[55:56.76]Where's he going?
[55:58.90]There he is.
[55:59.34]Alright, easy.
[56:12.16]What's going on?
[56:14.69]What?
[56:15.07]Oh, Jesus.
[56:15.55]I didn't put this away.
[56:16.57]Okay, go.
[56:17.12]Get him.
[56:24.24]Where?
[56:24.50]What?
[56:27.94]Headshot.
[56:28.44]I knocked his feathers off his head.
[56:30.44]That's how deranged I am.
[56:33.01]I took off his toupee.
[56:34.87]He's throwing a rock.
[56:36.39]What?
[56:37.57]Woo!
[56:42.03]Wow, that hurts.
[56:45.27]What about his tail?
[56:56.54]I think I just made him angry by taking off his wig.
[56:58.54]Alright, change of plan.
[57:05.14]Put it away.
[57:08.74]Now he's running with the egg.
[57:09.52]I want to do spread and just get in close.
[57:16.43]Nice jump.
[57:18.13]There's a lot of mushrooms and shit, but then I don't get time for that.
[57:26.26]No, no time for that either.
[57:28.18]Where is he?
[57:28.56]There he is.
[57:33.16]Mm-hmm.
[57:34.92]Well, let me just shoot at nothing.
[57:39.92]I'm trying to get his tail.
[57:51.15]And here he goes after my buddy.
[57:58.74]Ow!
[57:59.50]Not good.
[58:03.60]He got another rock.
[58:04.44]I'm gonna heal here.
[58:07.22]Just drink the apple juice, you'll be fine.
[58:12.57]There's something else here though.
[58:25.15]What?
[58:25.41]Is he blocking his face?
[58:30.42]What about poison?
[58:31.62]Is that good?
[58:33.06]I'm assuming I get poisons.
[58:39.44]It seems like what it does.
[58:40.52]Maybe I have to hit him more than once.
[58:41.59]Oh, I got plenty of stamina.
[58:50.19]Shit, I missed!
[58:53.51]Ow!
[58:53.83]Oh no!
[58:54.91]Oh no!
[58:56.73]Oh no!
[58:57.71]Drink it!
[58:58.43]Oh no!
[59:00.05]Oh boy.
[59:00.67]Alright, we're good.
[59:05.84]Don't let him get away.
[59:06.98]Watch out for the Scream Man over there on the left.
[59:12.14]Nah, I say the T-Rex is right over there.
[59:13.78]You're right.
[59:14.06]I have to be very careful about that.
[59:20.71]Forget about the footprints.
[59:21.74]I'm out of stamina.
[59:22.44]I gotta eat this shit.
[59:26.86]Where did he come from?
[59:31.14]There he is.
[59:32.20]Wait, no.
[59:32.50]What?
[59:32.88]That's... No, I don't want to aggro that thing.
[59:34.90]Do not aggro him.
[59:39.47]Oh, son of a bitch.
[59:40.15]Where is he?
[59:40.71]He's trying to heal over here.
[59:46.71]Thinks he's gonna get away.
[59:47.75]Yanked.
[59:51.09]Let's do it.
[59:51.49]Come on.
[59:55.09]Load it up.
[59:56.09]Load it up.
[59:57.72]Load it.
[59:58.16]Get out of here, please.
[60:08.18]Whoa!
[60:15.70]Do it again.
[60:21.11]Alright, I like the slicing ammo.
[60:22.31]I think it works pretty well.
[60:27.85]Just stuff these up his ass, and they'll all hurt him.
[60:31.37]That works.
[60:36.31]Right?
[60:36.49]I gotta get him in the head.
[60:40.05]The head would be a perfect shot here.
[60:42.75]No, it's in the neck.
[60:45.39]Damn it.
[60:45.63]It's alright.
[60:46.69]Come and dive at me.
[60:50.31]Come on.
[60:54.30]There it is, right in the mouth.
[60:56.30]How much damage is he gonna do?
[60:57.92]4?
[60:57.94]7.
[61:00.02]Get all slicing ammo!
[61:01.52]Oh no!
[61:02.56]Oh no!
[61:02.92]No!
[61:04.18]No!
[61:08.85]Oh, this is bad.
[61:10.45]Is he dead?
[61:11.49]Will he die?
[61:12.09]Will they fight each other?
[61:15.65]I don't know.
[61:16.13]I just need to complete... He's mad at me.
[61:19.37]They're both mad at me.
[61:20.01]This is not good.
[61:21.05]This actually is very bad.
[61:26.38]Let's let them fight for a second.
[61:27.66]He's trying to get away.
[61:28.58]I gotta get out of this too.
[61:33.10]Oh, shit.
[61:34.00]Can I climb this?
[61:36.06]God damn it.
[61:39.15]Climb the vines.
[61:43.79]The big guy's not chasing me, right?
[61:48.41]Hurry up and run.
[61:49.03]Let's get the pierced ammo out.
[61:58.61]Just like the old Monster Hunters.
[62:02.31]It's like I never stopped.
[62:03.69]These really hurt.
[62:06.23]Put this away and run after him.
[62:14.45]Up, up, up.
[62:17.28]I love the Star Wars music that plays, though.
[62:22.90]Come on.
[62:25.70]Yep, yep, you ain't gonna get far.
[62:29.84]Let me eat another one of these.
[62:33.57]I didn't even need to do that.
[62:35.03]Let me capture him.
[62:36.01]Right?
[62:36.23]Capture that.
[62:36.99]I'm going to capture this fucking guy.
[62:40.85]Oh, activate it.
[62:41.75]Knock him out.
[62:42.09]Did I get him?
[62:50.22]I didn't get him.
[62:51.38]Okay.
[62:52.86]We're just going to have to kill him.
[62:57.76]He's eating.
[62:58.64]That's what's going on here.
[63:02.15]Why is he not paying attention to me?
[63:03.37]You should be... I don't understand.
[63:10.69]What is he doing?
[63:12.26]Oh, he's stunned.
[63:18.20]I think I broke... I think his eyes are gone.
[63:20.46]Can I capture him now?
[63:33.20]I don't think I can.
[63:34.36]I just have to kill- this is like sad right now.
[63:36.65]This is like actually making me sad.
[63:38.13]This- I'm sad.
[63:42.99]I'm really sad, but this is like- it just has to be done.
[63:52.04]The caption is to capture bugs.
[64:00.75]Give me a fucking break.
[64:04.09]Ah, come on!
[64:05.09]God damn it.
[64:07.53]Got him.
[64:07.91]At least I got him in the tail.
[64:16.46]Dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge!
[64:17.58]Don't reload the gun!
[64:18.46]That's why I didn't like crossbows.
[64:24.62]Takes too long to reload!
[64:30.40]Somebody just healed me.
[64:32.36]Weird.
[64:36.40]Just kill him already?
[64:37.36]Oh, you must be new to Monster Hunter.
[64:39.44]It takes like 15 minutes to kill an enemy in Monster Hunter.
[64:43.70]It takes like an hour to fight enemies here.
[64:45.76]It's like this is going to be like a 17 hour long stream.
[64:48.68]Just on this boss alone.
[64:54.87]Oh, they threw it at me.
[64:58.90]Oh, it was the little guy.
[65:00.30]Okay.
[65:01.32]Let's just do some normal shots here.
[65:08.10]Just kill him already.
[65:09.13]Did he just break through?
[65:16.01]I think he did.
[65:19.67]Interesting shield you have there.
[65:22.98]Oh, god damn it.
[65:24.18]That was lucky.
[65:25.42]He's critical, though.
[65:28.01]See him He's got to be close The weapon kind of sucks Don't say that I chose a fine weapon There it is Dead
[65:57.07]Completed expedition.
[65:58.25]Now let's rip this guy apart.
[65:59.81]See what he has.
[66:00.29]I gotta go, like, investigate the other eggs, too.
[66:09.65]A Kulu Yaku scale.
[66:15.12]The ranged weapons are terrible in this game.
[66:16.58]Well, even better reason for me to try to be good.
[66:23.28]There we go.
[66:26.68]We got it.
[66:27.46]Large doodles.
[66:29.12]Let me just take a look at these just to have them.
[66:31.10]Because I feel like I'm going to need them at some point.
[66:36.91]I was just toying with them.
[66:38.45]That's not true.
[66:46.88]Yeah, that's not abnormal though.
[66:50.14]If people are curious as to why that took so long.
[66:54.04]That's just kind of the way it is.
[66:58.52]It just takes a long time, because monsters have a ton of health.
[67:01.16]I remember the last game, these were actually pretty hard to come by.
[67:06.35]The monster bones?
[67:15.37]Alright.
[67:17.73]Face emote?
[67:18.47]What do you mean, face emote?
[67:20.36]So that's all done.
[67:22.08]I do need to figure out how to make ammo, otherwise I'm gonna be guy with, like, shitty bullets.
[67:28.43]Alright.
[67:29.71]I'm about to return to Astera.
[67:31.70]Let's see how Talos is doing.
[67:33.86]Alright, how you doing?
[67:35.02]I'm about to return to Astera.
[67:38.40]Listen, I'm going to return to Astera way faster than you, okay?
[67:42.04]Okay.
[67:43.08]Wait, are you done?
[67:44.14]I just, I mean, I killed the monster.
[67:46.28]I'm just kind of gathering up all this stuff in its lair.
[67:48.48]Did you go to its lair?
[67:50.66]I mean, I'm in its lair.
[67:52.22]Yeah, I literally, did you like just beat the monster like two minutes, three minutes ago?
[67:56.97]Yeah, pretty much.
[67:57.89]I think we might have killed the monster at the exact same time.
[68:01.33]Probably did.
[68:03.01]Because I just finished picking up his, like, bone piles and all the intel.
[68:07.25]Same here.
[68:07.75]Just did the same exact thing.
[68:09.42]Well, there you go.
[68:10.24]I think that's everything.
[68:11.36]I think that's it.
[68:14.10]So this expedition that we're on, though, like, notice how it doesn't have a time limit?
[68:17.96]Yeah.
[68:18.66]You can literally just roam around and, like, hunt the other monsters and stuff.
[68:22.37]That's cool.
[68:23.39]Collect gear or crafting stuff, I guess.
[68:28.62]So it's nice that it's not all just like mission, time mission.
[68:35.78]Sorry, everyone's going to be really mad at me for shooting somebody when they're asleep.
[68:39.22]But like, look, I'm a fucking Monster Hunter, okay?
[68:41.66]That's just what we do.
[68:44.93]So did you already fast travel back or no?
[68:46.83]I'm literally just hitting monsters and going to be carving up some stuff.
[68:51.67]Yeah, I'm going back now.
[68:53.23]How do you change slinger ammo?
[68:55.53]That is a good question.
[68:58.65]Gotta be like an easy way to do it.
[69:01.71]Let's just check your... What's the thing?
[69:05.86]The... Not research points.
[69:09.49]the resource center shit the bounties yeah you do that the resource center is back at uh honey base camp okay so just make sure you've done like hunt two large monsters mine 12 times oh that stuff like the side quests okay actually some of those are like impossible to do here so I did a couple of them let me see the bounties yeah I need three more mining
[69:36.81]gathered have you gathered 12 times at bone piles uh is this the streamer with shitty bullets yes it is did you only craft like default bullets um no no I have plenty of ammo for the stuff but uh I we should just we should just go back and do something together alright I'm just gonna finish up like one or two of these bounties real quick it should take like two seconds let me uh let me know when you're done with that
[70:07.02]Because when you're done, I'm pretty much ready.
[70:10.37]I'm just kind of aimlessly walking around collecting things.
[70:13.03]I mean, you could go back to town and turn in and upgrade your gear.
[70:16.55]That is true.
[70:18.65]But there's so many things to pick up, I have to get them all.
[70:20.67]There are so many things to pick up, and there's like a thousand icons on the map.
[70:24.84]There's too many icons on the map.
[70:26.06]I need to pick them all up.
[70:27.36]Like every single type of herb in Barry has its own icon.
[70:31.47]There's all these bugs everywhere.
[70:33.97]I'm sliding.
[70:35.29]Flame nuts.
[70:36.67]You know, get some flame nuts.
[70:38.25]I actually do need those.
[70:39.51]I think I need them to craft.
[70:41.83]Oh, we got some footprint.
[70:44.82]Field research is almost three to three.
[70:46.34]What was that for?
[70:47.56]To, uh... Oh, honey!
[70:50.38]Ah, here we go, here we go.
[70:51.86]I need to get three of these.
[70:56.02]Oh, look who's gonna get the honey first!
[70:57.47]Look who's gonna complete the honey challenge first.
[71:00.63]I don't even know if I had a honey challenge.
[71:03.43]Just embarrassing myself with my weapon right now.
[71:07.15]This is a new little zone here.
[71:08.39]What do you think, huh?
[71:13.75]I'm not going to hurt you.
[71:17.51]What's this question mark?
[71:18.43]Oh, we got a mine.
[71:22.19]You can use the bumpers to filter the map.
[71:26.36]You can?
[71:26.64]Yeah.
[71:28.28]That's interesting.
[71:31.37]This is a pre-recorded stream.
[71:33.27]Why?
[71:35.35]That is so funny that we ended up killing the monster at the exact same time.
[71:40.68]It's a pretty good little chase.
[71:42.24]Yeah.
[71:45.28]What about over here?
[71:48.96]I do want to just have my cat stay home, though.
[71:51.99]Yeah, I do too.
[71:53.21]It just makes it a little too easy.
[71:55.48]It's not that it makes it super easy.
[71:56.88]I mean, this is obviously going to be a little bit harder later, but I don't like when games give you that companion that's just always there and is always just helping you.
[72:03.77]I'd rather lose.
[72:04.33]I don't mind the companion if the monster didn't draw aggro to the cat.
[72:10.51]Because it's confusing when your cat is in a corner and you're like, why is the monster stuck in the corner?
[72:15.51]But it's because your cat is in the corner.
[72:18.65]Yeah.
[72:21.23]You know what?
[72:21.61]Fuck this.
[72:22.41]I'm going to show you guys how you massacre a group of enemies.
[72:34.20]Yeah.
[72:35.32]Something like that.
[72:36.10]I could have a gun.
[72:37.18]Something like that.
[72:37.78]Alright, but where are all the, like, things to mine?
[72:43.79]I guess we could just do this over the course of multiple missions.
[72:46.13]It's not like it has to be done right now.
[72:47.87]Didn't kill any.
[72:48.69]Yes, I did.
[72:49.23]I got, like, three of them.
[72:50.10]I got, like, ten of them.
[72:56.12]I do need to examine the blueprint list because I'm going to start to run out of
[73:02.86]Materials I'm gonna start to run out of ammo and that really will be embarrassing Speaking of oh boy.
[73:11.71]Oh boy.
[73:12.11]Oh boy.
[73:12.43]Oh boy.
[73:12.87]Oh boy hide hide.
[73:13.69]How do I hide?
[73:14.16]What's the hide button?
[73:18.56]I've had enough I've had fun.
[73:20.12]Alright.
[73:20.48]How do I go back to Astera?
[73:22.06]What's the button?
[73:23.48]It's this button, right?
[73:25.83]Okay back to the camp.
[73:27.87]Yes.
[73:28.07]Oh
[73:29.47]That just scared the shit out of me.
[73:31.01]I thought that was the T-Rex on my back.
[73:34.47]Yeah, I had some pretty fun encounters with, like, the random big beasts that we haven't gotten to hunt yet.
[73:39.65]Alright, I guess we can just go back, and I can complete the rest of the side quests just naturally.
[73:45.77]Organically.
[73:48.23]Make it organic.
[73:49.17]That was cool.
[73:49.85]That was a very, like, fun, like, 30 minutes there.
[73:56.88]Just worry about normal shot two, mostly.
[74:00.02]Yeah.
[74:02.50]Wait, no, I wasn't supposed to... Oh, no, I pushed the wrong button.
[74:05.78]What have you done?
[74:07.38]I think... Aren't you supposed to talk to the guy or are you supposed to go straight back to camp?
[74:10.34]Because I just went... I just went back, just completed expedition.
[74:15.70]I think that's what I did, but...
[74:18.19]I don't know.
[74:19.21]This is not on a PS4 Pro.
[74:20.39]It is on a just default standard PlayStation 4.
[74:23.17]I looked up what the difference was between how it plays on both of them, and it's pretty much just slightly better resolution.
[74:29.79]I think the frame rate is still locked at 30.
[74:32.57]No, you can change that.
[74:33.77]No, I looked it up.
[74:34.84]If you go in the options menu, it says prioritize resolution, prioritize frame rate.
[74:38.58]Yes, that prioritizes locking 30 FPS so it never dips below 30.
[74:42.12]Well, the review that I said, that I saw,
[74:45.10]I said, the review that I saw said it goes up to like 45 FPS if you prioritize frame rate.
[74:50.64]I think that's true.
[74:51.20]It does kind of go up to like 40 or 45, but let's be honest, okay?
[74:55.15]The human eye cannot see above 25 frames per second.
[74:57.29]Well, let's just be honest.
[74:59.07]The PC version is going to be 600 FPS anyway, so don't worry.
[75:02.23]Alright, so you got some bounties completed.
[75:06.01]Don't let me down.
[75:07.19]The review that I said, 45 FPS, laugh out loud.
[75:13.33]Come on.
[75:15.76]Don't you know these machines can't handle it?
[75:17.18]You know, that's 50% faster than our maximum FPS right now.
[75:20.82]Don't you know that the computers just can't handle it?
[75:23.90]These little CPUs inside the PlayStation 4 can't handle it.
[75:27.22]Alright, so we have... Plus it wouldn't hurt.
[75:33.79]Okay.
[75:35.69]New delivery request.
[75:37.35]Right.
[75:38.39]We're cinematic this way.
[75:40.69]Okay, mix some honey with a potion and you get a mega potion.
[75:44.91]She keeps calling me Fiverr.
[75:45.99]That is not what I name my character.
[75:48.49]I need to see what the hell this even does.
[75:53.33]My brain is... Broken.
[75:56.48]You need to sometimes take a moment and just figure it out, okay?
[76:04.02]So, I don't have the materials.
[76:05.70]You need... What do you need?
[76:08.84]Do you need ten herbs to make one potion?
[76:12.47]Uh, I've already made my required mega potion.
[76:15.18]In fact, I have six mega potions.
[76:16.88]Where's my... I already collected honey.
[76:20.08]Where the hell is it?
[76:20.78]I'm already done.
[76:22.20]Where's the honey that I already picked up?
[76:23.80]Where'd it go?
[76:24.14]Do I have to, like, have... I don't understand.
[76:28.93]Alright, one sec.
[76:31.99]Didn't I collect honey?
[76:37.06]I have no idea.
[76:40.86]I can't make that yet.
[76:43.60]I sold it.
[76:44.18]What do you mean I sold it?
[76:51.22]Oh, the honey was used to auto-craft the mega potion.
[76:54.72]Oh, okay.
[76:58.07]I see.
[76:58.53]Okay, I understand.
[77:01.23]Hence that check.
[77:01.99]Okay, I see.
[77:02.83]Alright, so let me go to
[77:09.01]Normal ammo 2.
[77:10.13]I need gunpowder level 2 plus normal ammo.
[77:14.17]I need to make gunpowder level 1.
[77:17.19]So that's fire herbs and nitro shrooms.
[77:19.35]Where the hell do you get that?
[77:23.10]Let me just turn that off.
[77:24.18]Actually, I don't mind that.
[77:29.30]Fire herb and nitro.
[77:30.40]I'm assuming I have to go somewhere that has fire everywhere.
[77:34.24]Everything's like burnt.
[77:44.74]What do you mean 45 frames?
[77:46.22]I'm only looking at one.
[77:47.22]Alright, speak to the commander.
[77:53.77]Let's just get this over with.
[77:57.13]I do want to go talk to the blacksmith and see if I can upgrade anything.
[78:05.50]Hello, commander.
[78:08.08]Nice work.
[78:08.96]The pukey pukey hunt is on.
[78:15.60]Take out the Pukey Pukey.
[78:17.04]Good luck.
[78:17.68]Be careful.
[78:19.18]Alright.
[78:21.44]So let me just go to the blacksmith.
[78:28.58]Alright.
[78:28.96]So did you see that at the resource center?
[78:32.39]Yeah.
[78:32.67]We now have investigations that we can do, which are basically side quests, but they have like slightly stricter failure conditions.
[78:41.71]Mm hmm.
[78:43.39]And they come with question mark rewards that include money and loot.
[78:48.95]Money and loot?
[78:49.47]And you can only attempt them a limited number of times.
[78:53.43]That's interesting stuff.
[78:54.77]So this one you can only try three times.
[78:57.11]And if you fail, then the game says you suck and you don't get the loot.
[79:01.20]Alright.
[79:01.58]So I can make a Jagras assault gun.
[79:07.94]Okay.
[79:08.46]Thanks.
[79:09.10]Thanks.
[79:09.46]I'm... I'm wondering... I'm wondering... Wyvernheart is... I'm wondering... Is it worth... Should I... Should I do that?
[79:19.97]I can also do the bone tree here, right?
[79:24.51]Bone shooter.
[79:26.09]I need to upgrade my gear, too.
[79:27.47]So I'm going to do that.
[79:28.95]My stream is lagging for no reason.
[79:36.41]Hmm.
[79:39.96]I wonder if I should just do this.
[79:40.96]Hmm.
[79:49.26]I have the scales.
[79:51.79]That's from the Great Jagras Scale.
[79:58.11]Change weapon?
[79:58.67]No, I'm not going to change a weapon yet.
[80:01.17]I need to upgrade my stream with these scales.
[80:03.15]Because Comcast sucks.
[80:09.72]Under development.
[80:11.26]I think... I'll try it.
[80:13.76]Why not?
[80:15.04]It gets more damage.
[80:19.30]Let's give it a go.
[80:21.84]It's a little bit more... It's like... Slightly more damage.
[80:25.95]And... Alright, so I see here.
[80:28.25]So you can go to... This is Jagras Assault 1.
[80:30.81]This is going to be Jagras Assault 2.
[80:33.67]Just to keep killing great Jagrases.
[80:39.11]Oh, Lord.
[80:39.73]Okay.
[80:39.99]You can actually see the full tree here.
[80:45.01]I need fire herbs.
[80:47.65]Bad.
[80:48.01]Well, there it is.
[80:49.07]It's on me.
[80:54.20]Should I even upgrade any of these?
[80:56.19]Alright, you do that and poke me when you're done.
[80:58.31]Because I'm going to do mine on my side.
[81:00.09]So that way we're not talking over each other.
[81:01.77]Well, here's the one thing I remember from playing Monster Hunter.
[81:05.43]From your experience in Wii U?
[81:06.89]From my experience playing the seven-year-old version of this game.
[81:12.13]Those armor spheres, aren't they kind of valuable?
[81:15.11]I feel like those armor spheres... I don't know what an armor sphere is.
[81:17.76]That's how you upgrade your armor.
[81:21.10]I do remember specifically seeing that anything that you upgrade, you will refund if you downgrade it.
[81:27.90]Okay.
[81:28.70]Except money.
[81:29.54]So you lose the money, but you get the resources back.
[81:32.48]Oh.
[81:34.16]Yeah.
[81:36.18]I'm just going to go back.
[81:37.02]That is guaranteed.
[81:38.50]You will lose the money, but you get the ingredients.
[81:41.38]Etalyx, what is the thing that you mix together to make?
[81:45.34]What are the things you pick up from the ground that are one of the resources in this game?
[81:52.78]Like, you have ore, you mine ore, and you gather... Yeah.
[81:56.85]Herbs?
[81:57.61]Yes.
[81:58.17]Okay.
[81:58.57]So, what's the problem, chat?
[82:01.69]Everyone thinks we're saying that weirdly.
[82:02.91]Herbs.
[82:03.89]You don't say Herbs.
[82:05.39]No, it's not Herbs.
[82:06.65]It's Herbs.
[82:07.11]No, it's not Herbs.
[82:07.88]No, it's not.
[82:08.66]No, it is not.
[82:09.42]It's not Herbs.
[82:10.94]Herbs.
[82:26.29]I thought, no, herbs is American.
[82:28.02]Herb is, it's just like when, it's just like aluminum versus aluminum.
[82:34.78]That's right.
[82:35.16]They're both two different pronunciations.
[82:36.42]Controversy versus controversy.
[82:38.36]Controversy, controversy.
[82:42.26]Herbs.
[82:43.95]You guys.
[82:46.63]Actually, I'm wrong.
[82:48.03]I'm wrong.
[82:48.61]It is, British is herb and herb is everyone else.
[82:52.81]How dare you.
[82:55.09]Alright, let me see here.
[82:56.47]The British people are the ones with the hard H. Oh, the British people.
[83:00.45]Yeah.
[83:01.13]I'm going to reload.
[83:02.12]I'm going to do reload.
[83:03.30]Keep that on.
[83:09.84]He has it backwards.
[83:10.90]What?
[83:11.26]I don't think he does.
[83:12.72]For once, like, I thought the Americans were the ones with, like, the crass pronunciation, you know?
[83:17.67]Like, herb.
[83:19.53]Alright.
[83:20.21]Weapons.
[83:21.17]Armor.
[83:21.61]Hey, do you have any herbs?
[83:23.87]Why were you just doing Stewie Griffin?
[83:25.37]Do you have any herbs?
[83:27.17]Excuse me, Brian, do you have any herbs?
[83:30.43]Let's do a Stewie Griffin off.
[83:32.67]Who's doing the better Stewie Griffin?

[83:40.87]I don't do stupid voices.
[83:42.95]Oh, wow!
[83:44.19]What the heck, man?
[83:46.02]Except for mine.
[83:46.94]Stupid voices.
[83:47.50]That's the only stupid voice that I do.

[87:07.39]Thank you to Campbell Chemistry for the $1.
[87:09.19]Jeremy, you want to know what real adventure games look like?
[87:11.41]Play SpongeBob SquarePants Battle for Bikini Bottom.
[87:13.93]Isn't that like a shitty racing game?
[87:18.96]Or am I thinking of something else?
[87:22.74]Anyways, thank you.
[87:24.52]Thank you to Comcast Customer Care for the $2.50.
[87:27.16]Pet the cat.
[87:28.76]Alright, fine.
[87:31.00]That's not what I wanted to do.
[87:34.05]I can't pet the cat.
[87:35.13]There's no way to do it.
[87:36.47]It doesn't work.
[87:38.61]See?
[87:40.29]This is not a cat.
[87:41.33]This is not a typical cat that you guys are thinking of.
[87:43.94]This is an anthropomorphic human cat.
[87:46.90]Because look, it's standing on its two legs.
[87:49.64]That's how you can tell when you've got an anthropomorphic person here.
[87:52.88]That's all that matters.
[87:54.78]Nothing else matters.
[87:55.46]Like, oh, if a cat can talk, that's fine.
[87:58.64]Is the cat on all fours?
[88:00.51]That's a talking cat.
[88:03.59]That's not a furry.
[88:05.27]That's not an anthropomorphic person.
[88:07.37]Is the cat on two legs?
[88:09.31]Yes.
[88:10.35]Anthropomorphic.
[88:16.72]Forget about everything you know.
[88:17.90]It doesn't even matter that this cat is not talking.
[88:20.82]It's on two legs.
[88:24.79]Cat on four legs that can speak?
[88:27.91]That's a talking cat.
[88:34.60]He said furry on stream, unsubbed.
[88:37.42]Look, we're trying to kill time, okay?
[88:38.96]Okay?
[88:39.66]Okay?

[89:25.22]I ain't gonna say shit, because I don't want to give them something to spam in chat.
[89:31.03]Thank you, though.
[89:31.77]Hey, I'm ready.
[89:34.15]I'm ready for you.
[89:36.51]Hey, me too.
[89:37.73]Cool.
[89:38.01]Going to the Gathering Hub now.
[89:39.23]I'm in the Gathering Hub.
[89:42.03]Now I need to find the general store.
[89:45.65]Is there like a general store up here?
[89:48.19]I don't know.
[89:48.91]Let's take a look.
[89:50.89]So what's this game about?
[89:52.67]Well, that's a big question.
[89:54.29]This game is about catching and releasing fish.
[90:01.64]It's called Fish Hunter.
[90:03.30]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[90:03.96]You know what?
[90:04.90]Why don't we arm wrestle?
[90:06.96]Okay.
[90:07.36]You want to arm wrestle?
[90:08.86]There's an arm wrestling barrel right here.
[90:11.72]I'm waiting.
[90:13.08]I'm waiting.
[90:13.85]You gotta come to my arm wrestling barrel.
[90:15.93]I'm at the top of the ship.
[90:17.07]No, I can't move.
[90:18.63]There's super glue on here.
[90:19.79]Me neither.
[90:20.29]Wow, look at that.
[90:21.35]I'll come to you.
[90:22.07]Fine.
[90:22.87]This one's much better.
[90:24.29]By the way, if somebody's curious, we have a squad.
[90:26.76]Yes, we're currently the men's bathroom.
[90:28.80]That's their name of our squad.
[90:31.74]That's not a joke.
[90:32.52]Are you ready to get your ass kicked?
[90:33.82]That's true.
[90:36.57]Let's do it.
[90:37.89]So how do you do this?
[90:39.05]I don't know.
[90:39.93]But you got one second to figure it out.
[90:41.37]You got one second to go.
[90:42.13]Oh.
[90:42.61]Oh!
[90:49.54]Fliparoo!
[90:52.88]Can I do an emote?
[90:53.76]Can I do an emote dance?
[90:56.26]How do you do emotes?
[90:57.66]Get back on air.
[90:58.16]I was pressing X.
[91:03.70]It's circle.
[91:04.92]It's circle.
[91:07.68]No, no, no.
[91:08.62]I was pressing X. Oh, where are you?
[91:13.31]Yeah.
[91:13.65]Oh yeah.
[91:14.01]You got faked out.
[91:14.95]Alright.
[91:17.11]Are you ready?
[91:17.61]I'm ready.
[91:22.47]We keep like queuing up.
[91:25.25]Who's the last man standing?
[91:34.94]The comeback.
[91:36.74]Yeah.
[91:37.94]Yeah.
[91:38.47]Alright.
[91:40.35]Last one.
[91:40.71]This is for prosperity.
[91:45.45]My arm wrestling arm is getting tired.
[91:47.23]I've been pushing the correct button two rounds ago.
[91:57.47]I'm losing.
[91:59.34]WHAT?!
[91:59.58]This game... This game SUCKS.
[92:01.02]Wait, how fast were you clicking?
[92:03.94]My clicks were too fast for the game to register.
[92:06.93]Listen to this.
[92:09.35]That's how fast I was going.
[92:10.23]I was going like this.
[92:33.56]You can't be faster than that, no way!
[92:38.64]Hold on.
[92:39.80]I got this, I got this, I got this.
[92:43.53]You ready?
[92:45.45]You ready for this?
[92:46.37]What am I ready for?
[92:49.69]Oh, yeah.
[92:52.31]Oh, next one?
[92:54.64]Yeah, I played so much Insane Aquarium, I should never lose that.
[92:58.76]One more, please.
[92:59.52]One more, please, for the cameras.
[93:04.72]I want you to go into the microphone how fast you were clicking.
[93:08.92]Okay.
[93:09.56]Do it.
[93:14.95]That's horse shit.
[93:17.07]Listen to this.
[93:22.91]Full presses count for more, man.
[93:24.73]Oh, that's bullshit.
[93:26.45]Full presses, not little baby half presses.
[93:32.18]Alright, let's play the game.
[93:34.14]Hey, we were.
[93:34.86]This is the game.
[93:36.22]This is the social area.
[93:39.79]Can you ring the gong?
[93:41.23]Not safe for work.
[93:48.99]Alright.
[93:49.83]How do we do this?
[93:50.71]No, no, no.
[93:51.35]Where are we going?
[93:53.37]It was half press.
[93:54.37]Those aren't half presses.
[93:55.65]Those are full clicks.
[93:57.13]To be accepted into the squad of man's bathroom, you have to win at arm wrestling first.
[94:03.09]Two out of three.
[94:05.89]Otherwise, you get the boot.
[94:07.68]You know when the guy has the fucking camera?
[94:10.96]That's not like the shutter speed.
[94:12.58]You've got a high shutter speed camera.
[94:14.62]I'm going so fast, you can't even capture me.
[94:17.96]You can't even capture me on that camera.
[94:21.76]What did you want to do?
[94:23.82]The pukey pukey hunt.
[94:25.50]Pukey pukey hunt?
[94:30.36]We don't really have anything...
[94:35.33]An A-Press has three parts.
[94:36.65]What's my actual quest?
[94:38.69]You're not on accept urgent?
[94:39.91]Oh, I haven't spoken to the commander yet.
[94:41.97]Oh, come on, Etalyx.
[94:45.77]Where, like, on the fast travel is he?
[94:53.33]Let's see.
[94:55.33]Plus, don't we have to, like, watch the cutscene first before we can queue up for something?
[94:59.31]I'm currently on accept urgent pukey pukey.
[95:03.09]Is it really called Pukey Pukey?
[95:05.01]Yes.
[95:05.61]What is the actual name of the quest?
[95:07.83]It's accept urgent colon Pukey Pukey hunt.
[95:12.37]Spell Pukey Pukey.
[95:13.47]P-U-K-E-I.
[95:19.19]It's Pukey.
[95:20.97]Okay.
[95:22.42]Are you thinking I'm making this up?
[95:23.64]It's actually Pukey Pukey.
[95:25.42]Alright.
[95:26.48]Okay.
[95:27.72]I'm not making it up.
[95:28.52]I swear to God.
[95:33.18]Doki doki.
[95:35.08]Doki doki.
[95:42.09]Let's buy some stuff.
[95:43.87]To the pouch.
[95:47.13]I'll be with you momentarily.
[95:49.79]It's three megahertz.
[95:51.91]Three megahertz for one normal ammo.
[95:55.42]How many do I have?
[95:57.40]Okay, it is the pukey pukey hunt.
[96:00.72]I told you.
[96:02.46]Come on, man.
[96:03.10]I think I'm making this up.
[96:10.16]Sounds urgent.
[96:12.35]Alright, trap tool.
[96:18.89]You know, we can trap monsters.
[96:21.57]In fact, we are going to have to trap monsters.
[96:25.06]That's going to be like a quest.
[96:27.53]I think it's one of the commissioned quests.
[96:30.59]I'm buying one.
[96:31.51]The monster we just killed, we have to trap it for a separate optional quest.
[96:35.77]Right, right, right.
[96:38.28]Alright.
[96:38.92]Let's... I think I'm alright.
[96:41.66]I think I'm good for a pukey pukey right now.
[96:44.90]Okay.
[96:47.34]You need to go talk to the thing so we can do urgent pukey pukey.
[96:49.72]I think... Let's see if you can... I wonder if you can join this from here if I have to be in the gather area.
[96:57.16]If I do join quest, will it be disputed?
[96:59.16]I am starting northeast or southeast.
[97:04.02]So join a quest.
[97:06.12]Did you start it?
[97:07.44]We'll start at the new camp.
[97:10.36]No quests have been posted.
[97:11.36]I just posted it.
[97:18.74]Alright.
[97:19.28]I gave it a second so it would show up.
[97:23.15]And... Look at that.
[97:26.43]You're using Iron Blade 2.
[97:27.99]Did you change weapons on me?
[97:30.69]I did.
[97:31.05]Which camp are you saying you want to start at?
[97:33.75]Southwest?
[97:35.07]The new one?
[97:36.11]The Northeast or whatever?
[97:37.15]Northeast?
[97:38.01]Alright.
[97:38.25]Well, I mean, that means we're not going to get a free checked bag.
[97:44.89]Alright.
[97:45.35]See, we don't have to be in the gathering area to do this.
[97:48.20]Let's do it.
[97:50.88]Stand by for Titanfall.
[97:53.24]You can test out my new gun.
[97:57.22]Waiting for party members.
[97:58.26]Oh, canteen.
[97:58.98]Hold on.
[97:59.40]Wait.
[97:59.54]Let me eat a food first.
[98:00.88]Oh, I want to eat a food.
[98:02.10]Well, then you got to eat a food.
[98:04.60]Alright.
[98:04.94]I'm at the canteen.
[98:05.69]How do I eat a food?
[98:07.21]Is this attack up?
[98:08.73]You just pick a platter.
[98:09.73]Of course there's a tutorial.
[98:12.21]I just assume every time I push a new button, there's a tutorial.
[98:17.43]Let's just go with attack.
[98:18.21]Attack up.
[98:22.30]Okay, so the meal effect lasts for the entire quest or until you leave.
[98:25.56]This is actually really cool, guys.
[98:27.18]You're going to laugh.
[98:28.94]Oh, never mind.
[98:29.38]I don't get to see the whole cutscene.
[98:30.78]Never mind.
[98:31.12]That was a lie.
[98:31.98]It's actually really fun to watch when they do it.
[98:35.58]Which one did you eat?
[98:37.22]The meat platter.
[98:37.73]I want more attack.
[98:41.85]I'm going to eat the hunter's platter.
[98:44.99]Now watch how cool this is.
[98:46.13]Your stream is going to get to see how fun it is.
[98:52.01]My stream didn't get to see it.
[98:56.38]It's just a bunch of cooking cats.
[98:57.96]It's like watching Ratatouille, but in reverse.
[99:00.02]I know.
[99:00.36]It's so fun.
[99:06.62]I got ammo.
[99:07.79]I'm ready to go.
[99:09.93]I'm prepared.
[99:10.57]Are you prepared?
[99:13.02]I am.
[99:13.74]I just got a bunch of good food in my belly.
[99:16.38]Are you prepared, huh?
[99:17.74]I'm ready.
[99:18.34]Waiting on you, actually.
[99:19.54]If anyone knows what that is, you have my utmost respect.
[99:25.00]Are you prepared, huh?
[99:27.81]What is that?
[99:28.15]I don't know.
[99:29.87]Are you prepared, huh?
[99:33.01]I wonder if anyone's going to get that.
[99:41.75]Holy shit, somebody got it.
[99:44.27]How did you know that?
[99:45.16]Wow.
[99:46.32]The Assault.
[99:47.92]Nice work.
[99:49.48]The Assault?
[99:51.78]No, the guy's name is The Assault.
[99:53.64]Congratulations.
[99:55.18]That is from No More Heroes.
[99:56.38]Holy shit, you are an observant person.
[100:00.51]Is there a monster on top of us?
[100:06.85]I took half.
[100:07.89]Now I'm going to do some practice.
[100:09.58]First aid med.
[100:10.22]Alright.
[100:12.32]We don't really need an antidote here, right?
[100:13.84]Let me just pick up normal ammo.
[100:17.68]99.
[100:18.46]These are all loaded up.
[100:23.51]First aid vets.
[100:24.19]Gonna have that.
[100:24.71]Let's use the free shit first.
[100:26.57]Yeah, so the talics can now fly.
[100:29.05]But he doesn't have a fun gun, though, that shoots.
[100:34.65]Does he?
[100:37.01]He doesn't have a gun, does he?
[100:39.01]I do not.
[100:41.63]Can you do that?
[100:42.81]Show me again.
[100:43.73]Show me something you can do.
[100:48.85]Cool.
[100:49.39]Want to see what I can do?
[100:50.69]What can you do?
[100:52.19]Waste your ammo.
[100:53.71]Go for it.
[100:57.25]Nice.
[100:59.43]That was flashy, if you ask me.
[101:02.12]Too flashy, I'd say.
[101:05.03]Make sure you use the free shit first.
[101:06.75]Don't use your own stuff.
[101:08.47]I can't release the bug yet.
[101:09.61]I have to have a target.
[101:10.67]Alright, so let's hunt the Pyuki Pyuki.
[101:13.16]Are you ready?
[101:14.40]That actually hits me and it hurts.
[101:15.76]It does like fucking 95% damage a swing.
[101:18.66]Toxic mucus down there.
[101:19.78]I see.
[101:20.88]Toxic mucus.
[101:25.98]I'm just waiting to see like the screen zoom out and it be like you died.
[101:28.80]I was honestly holding my breath because I was waiting to see if there was in fact fall damage.
[101:33.99]What do we got here?
[101:35.93]Okay.
[101:36.94]Looks like where I blew my nose earlier.
[101:38.22]We need to get some more investigations here.
[101:41.14]We're looking for... Leave it to Jerma to play the overpowered class.
[101:45.06]Everyone tells me this class sucks.
[101:47.58]Which is it?
[101:48.86]Is it the shittiest class or is it the easiest class?
[101:52.46]I keep hearing multiple different things.
[101:54.34]I'm pretty sure that... Could you come help me over here?
[102:02.15]I appear to be paralyzed.
[102:03.37]You're paralyzed?
[102:04.43]Yes.
[102:04.77]Come help me.
[102:07.45]Where are you?
[102:09.15]Okay, I think it's wearing off.
[102:10.13]Wait, hold on a minute.
[102:11.13]This is you just right here.
[102:12.21]What are you doing?
[102:12.59]What happened to you?
[102:13.67]I just got full body paralyzed.
[102:16.15]Wait, hold on.
[102:16.67]Stay.
[102:17.07]Don't move, citizen.
[102:20.36]I leave everything to me.
[102:21.72]That heals?
[102:24.62]Mm-hmm.
[102:25.62]You have a heal shot?
[102:26.50]I have a heal shot.
[102:27.50]That's kind of awesome, actually.
[102:28.76]Let me come up there and see it.
[102:32.28]By the way, I only have 11 more of those, so I don't think I want to use that.
[102:36.00]And that's it.
[102:38.09]Let's go.
[102:42.03]Make sure you pick up all the cool stuff.
[102:44.01]And we forgot to tell our cats to stay home.
[102:47.01]How do you do that?
[102:48.31]It's got to be in the options somewhere.
[102:50.64]Probably.
[102:51.64]Palico info.
[102:56.04]I can choose their equipment.
[102:56.96]What's the go home button?
[103:01.28]I think you have to do it inside the... You know how you go in your room?
[103:04.70]Mm-hmm.
[103:05.82]I think there might be an option with, like, the housekeeper.
[103:08.68]Probably.
[103:08.94]Possibly.
[103:11.90]It's been a long time since I've killed an innocent creature.
[103:14.34]I think we have information that he is over here.
[103:18.26]Or something is over here.
[103:19.16]It might not be the thing we're looking for.
[103:20.79]Could be, though.
[103:22.93]We'll find out.
[103:23.57]More footprints?
[103:25.45]We're almost at the... I must have a max on this thing.
[103:30.97]One more and I'll have him figured out completely.
[103:32.99]What about you?
[103:35.83]Why does your character look like you?
[103:39.01]I know, right?
[103:39.49]Did you make a character that looks like you?
[103:41.61]Come here.
[103:42.19]Come look.
[103:43.41]Why is this you?
[103:44.39]Alright, stare right there.
[103:48.47]You made you in the game.
[103:50.33]This doesn't look like me.
[103:52.41]Can you take off equipment here or no?
[103:56.30]I don't know.
[103:56.64]Maybe not.
[103:57.64]No.
[103:58.38]Oh, well.
[103:58.92]Yes, it is me.
[103:59.74]It's just me with greenish hair.
[104:03.14]You know, you don't even have to dye your hair anymore.
[104:04.94]You can just see what it looks like now.
[104:08.03]Alright, he's below us.
[104:09.47]He's like right over here.
[104:11.29]Is that him?
[104:12.49]That is the Pukey Pukey.
[104:13.41]Okay, so how do you want to go about doing this?
[104:15.65]Where is he?
[104:16.25]He's right underneath us.
[104:19.33]Directly underneath us?
[104:20.03]Directly underneath where I'm standing right now.
[104:22.10]Under the bridge.
[104:23.40]Well, uh... All I see are footprints.
[104:27.46]You don't see the giant monster that's right underneath us?
[104:30.78]Oh, that one, yes.
[104:31.76]Now I do it.
[104:32.34]Just did, like, a cinematic zoom on it.
[104:34.56]Well, I plan on just jumping down on top of him.
[104:37.42]Alright, this says watch out.
[104:38.28]Three, two, one.
[104:39.10]Okay.
[104:40.51]Well, you go ahead.
[104:42.21]Did you jump on him?
[104:44.29]Well, kind of.
[104:44.87]Alright, let's start it.
[104:47.07]Alright, it said watch out when his head swells up.
[105:05.95]Don't come for me.
[105:07.51]Get away from me, pukey.
[105:11.29]Get away from me, happy go pukey.
[105:16.27]Time to recover your health with this vigor wasp.
[105:24.44]Alright.
[105:25.64]Things are going well so far.
[105:26.86]I kind of want to get up a little closer.
[105:28.96]Things were going well.
[105:29.86]I've got to use my butt.
[105:30.66]Are you alright?
[105:31.50]He's got like a giant tongue.
[105:33.40]Are you alright?
[105:33.92]Don't worry.
[105:34.97]Suppressing fire.
[105:35.97]Ow.
[105:36.45]There we go.
[105:37.55]Bugs away.
[105:38.35]Ow.
[105:39.65]Well, now he's not because I put my weapon up.
[105:42.15]I need an antidote.
[105:48.04]It's just a full-bodied dive for some reason.
[105:52.24]Right in the head.
[105:52.82]Come here.
[105:57.52]Ooh, he's scary.
[105:58.62]Do I have any antidotes?
[105:59.70]He's flying away right now.
[106:01.56]He's escaping.
[106:03.79]Don't worry, we can track him.
[106:04.59]I feel like I'm playing Skyrim.
[106:07.87]How many endos do I need to take?
[106:12.41]Probably until your health bar is full.
[106:15.90]Let's keep going.
[106:18.28]Oh, he's scary.
[106:19.86]What commentary?
[106:21.44]Oh, he's scary.
[106:22.74]Hey, listen.
[106:23.84]This isn't easy, okay?
[106:25.96]This is like playing Dark Souls on stream.
[106:28.42]On stream, that's right.
[106:29.58]Everyone.
[106:30.18]It is.
[106:32.67]Are you following him?
[106:33.73]Yes, I am.
[106:34.65]I'm currently following... There he is.
[106:39.91]I found him.
[106:40.46]I'm trying to get my search meter full first.
[106:47.26]He's currently right here.
[106:48.46]I am on the way.
[106:52.69]On to A. He is currently fighting.
[106:57.82]There is another monster here.
[106:59.26]There is one of those great jaguars here.
[107:02.08]Let me get closer.
[107:03.32]Hey, I directed your attention to me.
[107:12.46]Ow!
[107:12.88]I just dove into the tongue.
[107:14.69]That hurts.
[107:17.99]Yeah!
[107:18.69]I'm on top of him.
[107:19.87]Are you nice?
[107:20.83]Yeah.
[107:21.45]Hey, good for you.
[107:24.07]Am I still on top of him?
[107:25.05]Where am I?
[107:26.86]I actually... You were on his back.
[107:28.48]You were in his mouth.
[107:30.38]Am I?
[107:30.78]Yes.
[107:30.94]Well, no.
[107:31.48]It looked like you were in his mouth.
[107:33.77]He's currently ramming into a tree to try to get me off.
[107:36.37]I'm on his tail.
[107:42.79]Shotgun in the face.
[107:43.56]He's trying to cut off his tail.
[107:46.44]Oh, he's knocked down.
[107:48.10]Capitalize.
[107:48.66]I got an achievement for that one.
[107:50.04]Capitalize.
[107:51.84]Capital D for destruction.
[107:57.55]It was worth doing it.
[108:04.83]Ow.
[108:05.33]Oh, Jesus, that hurt.
[108:09.23]Oh!
[108:09.99]I would have got... That would have knocked me out if I got hit by that, for sure.
[108:12.77]Careful.
[108:13.52]That would have not been good.
[108:17.57]You don't like my capital D for destruction?
[108:19.47]My terrible thing I said?
[108:20.75]I feel like maybe his wing looks like it could probably be destroyed here.
[108:26.38]We have the other monsters here, too.
[108:28.20]I'm using a whetstone real quick to get my sharpness back up.
[108:30.86]Well, now we can fight them both.
[108:31.66]We have to fight them both?
[108:34.08]Well, they're fighting each other.
[108:35.52]Oh, shit.
[108:36.26]They're currently playing Ring Around the Rosie.
[108:43.83]Ah, he scared us, apparently.
[108:46.11]Oh, I see the other monster now.
[108:48.86]You don't see Animal from the Muppets?
[108:50.38]He's right here.
[108:51.70]I do now, yes.
[108:53.50]Yeah, we both got the brunt of that one.
[108:55.80]Should we just kill this fucking thing?
[108:58.88]Get the scales to upgrade weapons and stuff.
[109:02.05]Do you think it's worth it, or should we... Well, we can do damage to him, but he's going to retreat when he starts taking too much, and we're going to have to hunt him, too.
[109:08.39]Yeah, that's true.
[109:09.15]No, forget it.
[109:10.38]Eyes on the prize.
[109:12.68]Look out.
[109:14.37]Eyes on the prize, I would say.
[109:16.39]That's for sure.
[109:17.95]Alright.
[109:18.57]Disengaging.
[109:21.27]Yeah, he's currently all the way over here.
[109:22.43]He's chasing me.
[109:23.39]Is he actually chasing you?
[109:24.27]We're about to go to, like, the monster's lair.
[109:26.31]Yep.
[109:29.56]And... Nope, he's coming by.
[109:30.96]I think I lost him.
[109:32.28]I think I lost him.
[109:35.04]Wait, is this that hurt?
[109:37.16]Yeah, we were here.
[109:40.19]That little nub on his tail looks like it could be hurt or destroyed or something.
[109:46.43]I'm going to give it a go.
[109:49.77]Okay, what was that candy?
[109:51.62]The candy?
[109:52.22]You know the candy rope?
[109:53.28]That guy has a candy rope tail.
[109:55.40]Nerd's rope.
[109:57.00]Pretty much, except it's not that.
[109:58.36]It's something else.
[109:58.82]It's weird.
[109:59.24]It's this weird candy, like fluffy candy rope.
[110:02.10]That's his tail.
[110:05.88]I'm going to try to hit the tail, the nub.
[110:09.61]Alright, using my bug lord.
[110:13.23]Try to cut his tail off.
[110:14.65]That's definitely like candy rope.
[110:15.79]We can get that.
[110:16.33]Alright, I'm going to try to jump on top of him again.
[110:21.29]If I can stop getting swept by this guy.
[110:23.93]I know, that hurt.
[110:25.59]Alright, potion time.
[110:29.51]Candy necklace?
[110:30.21]No, it's something weird.
[110:31.07]Oh, there's a unique mushroom colony over here.
[110:36.28]Flumps.
[110:36.62]There it is.
[110:37.16]Got it.
[110:37.68]Somebody got it.
[110:38.32]Excellent.
[110:38.71]I'm so glad somebody could just say that.
[110:42.59]I can't.
[110:43.05]He's just flying too much.
[110:45.47]You have a gun, though, so this should be right up your alley.
[110:48.47]I am currently shooting.
[110:49.23]Where's he going?
[110:49.77]Is he stuck?
[110:50.85]He's stuck on the branch.
[110:52.19]Perfect opportunity to shoot his fucking giant flump sack.
[110:56.76]Watch out for the flump sack.
[110:58.46]How do you jump on top of it?
[110:59.60]I don't know.
[111:01.98]I feel like I'm doing it, but it's not like...
[111:06.16]I don't have any slicing ammo, I would put it on.
[111:08.32]Shit, I'm poisoned.
[111:12.28]Antidote.
[111:14.72]Oh, boy.
[111:16.08]Come on, wake up.
[111:17.72]Wake up!
[111:18.16]Yeah, that's not good.
[111:18.98]That's not good.
[111:21.78]Eat it.
[111:22.02]Alright, it's him versus my bug, apparently.
[111:31.14]Hey, Bugboy's back.
[111:32.89]You got company behind you?
[111:34.25]I do.
[111:35.49]Yep.
[111:36.55]Okay.
[111:37.59]I need another antidote.
[111:40.09]We've got some little baby friends over here that might want to play.
[111:43.98]He is swollen.
[111:48.32]Come on.
[111:48.54]It takes you forever to drink.
[111:49.48]I can drink faster than this.
[111:56.14]Come on.
[111:57.16]Oh, I'm poison now?
[111:58.14]So what do you have to do when you're poison?
[111:59.18]You have to switch to the antidote?
[112:00.10]You gotta take an antidote.
[112:02.14]Oh my.
[112:05.04]Yeah, I see that.
[112:06.82]No!
[112:09.50]I keep... No, don't take the... I'm an idiot.
[112:12.24]Why am I doing that?
[112:13.54]You, like, let me collect it.
[112:15.34]Drinking some Pepto-Bismol.
[112:16.53]Alright, I'm gonna do it.
[112:19.07]I'm gonna unload on him.
[112:31.99]Fucking turkey.
[112:34.61]He's getting kind of crazy.
[112:36.55]Yes, he is.
[112:36.99]I really want to get that tail.
[112:42.43]We can utilize it.
[112:43.87]Where's he going?
[112:48.97]I got to learn how to use the radial venue.
[112:51.87]Finally landed back on him.
[112:52.99]Oh, not without me.
[112:55.66]We're going for the tail, right?
[112:56.52]We're going to try to go for the tail.
[112:58.06]Alright.
[113:02.82]That is ideal.
[113:03.32]He's going insane right now.
[113:08.66]He's trying to lick me off.
[113:11.08]Wow.
[113:12.44]Is he going?
[113:12.86]Even though I have to mash, I do have to evade his attacks because he can knock me off by breaking trees and stuff, which is insane.
[113:20.18]I'm running out of ammo here.
[113:21.00]Uh-oh.
[113:25.84]Where'd he go?
[113:26.20]He's in the air.
[113:27.02]Up in the sky?
[113:30.57]Oh, come on.
[113:31.01]Let me, like, Millennium Falcon this guy.
[113:32.73]Snipes.
[113:33.33]Oh, like, just Millennium Falcon him.
[113:35.34]And just he dies in the air.
[113:36.34]Oh, man.
[113:38.58]Oh, alright.
[113:38.92]Let's just... He's probably going to go recover.
[113:41.50]How do we get... You're going to have to just run around back that way.
[113:45.48]That would have been too easy if I could just... Big misses there.
[113:50.15]Jump over the wall.
[113:53.27]Oh, this one's kind of crazy.
[113:56.05]This ain't nothing.
[114:00.85]This shit's nothing.
[114:04.89]Let's get to full health.
[114:09.61]Run, run, run, run, run.
[114:10.81]Is this his lair?
[114:12.08]I'll just spread.
[114:15.56]There he is.
[114:29.23]Alright, out of range, I can... God damn it.
[114:32.01]What happens?
[114:32.45]This is his nest for sure.
[114:33.47]And I'm unconscious now.
[114:40.29]Move quickly.
[114:41.53]Am I poisoned?
[114:41.91]This is not a place you want to fall off.
[114:44.83]No, you don't.
[114:46.71]These cats keep freaking me out.
[114:49.17]I feel like I'm going to fall off, like, guaranteed.
[114:52.04]Don't poison me right when I get healed up, please.
[115:02.53]Is this his nest?
[115:03.53]I think so.
[115:07.45]I believe this is the nest.
[115:12.88]Alright, he kind of fell down.
[115:15.26]Just leaning over here.
[115:15.96]I'm waiting for him to go down on the ground again, because I'm just going to unload on his head.
[115:23.49]Spread ammo, too.
[115:24.25]I probably should be using that instead, huh?
[115:30.49]Give me that tail.
[115:31.19]Shoot his tail off!
[115:38.29]Get that tail!
[115:43.12]Is he unconscious?
[115:45.80]Not quite.
[115:50.60]Take a potion real quick.
[115:55.12]I'm getting ready to activate it.
[115:56.25]I think I'm gonna do it here in a minute.
[116:03.09]No, don't go in the air again.
[116:03.91]No!
[116:04.85]Oh, there he goes.
[116:06.15]There he goes.
[116:08.03]Give chase.
[116:11.35]Wait, there was a good bug.
[116:12.29]There was a good boy over here.
[116:13.27]Where is he?
[116:13.65]A god bug.
[116:14.63]Okay, I don't know what that means.
[116:19.63]Oh, there's an invisible wall there?
[116:20.93]Come on.
[116:23.63]Ow.
[116:23.77]I just got a little confused there.
[116:29.97]I'm getting a little confused too.
[116:31.11]I'm kind of like running.
[116:31.87]Oh, good bug.
[116:32.45]That good bug?
[116:32.93]Yeah, there's a good bug right there.
[116:35.23]Got the good bug.
[116:36.23]Oh, he's angry.
[116:37.85]Drink.
[116:38.33]Come on.
[116:38.79]Drink.
[116:39.45]Come on.
[116:42.28]Again?
[116:42.70]Back up to the nest?
[116:43.52]He's probably going to the nest again.
[116:45.36]This is like a WoW boss fight.
[116:47.46]Yeah, that's this whole game.
[116:48.60]No, he went down.
[116:50.20]Jump down.
[116:50.78]After him.
[116:56.33]Honey.
[116:56.73]Skip leg day.
[116:59.35]This whole game is just wow boss fight the game.
[117:01.99]There's so many dinosaurs down here.
[117:05.63]Jesus Christ.
[117:06.59]Alright, why does his face look like that?
[117:09.94]Why does he have a big scary face?
[117:11.90]It's like he's eating something and he's just getting ready to spit it back out at us.
[117:15.02]That's where he holds his tongue.
[117:17.26]I bet.
[117:17.52]Because you know he's got that tongue attack?
[117:19.10]Where am I?
[117:24.70]Oh, is that your bug that's making the purple shit?
[117:27.03]Yeah.
[117:28.59]It is a necessary part of my character class.
[117:31.73]Alright, we need to like... I gotta... Open your mouth.
[117:34.99]Let me get in there.
[117:35.55]I gotta hit him right in the face.
[117:41.68]Now's your chance.
[117:42.58]He's looking right at you.
[117:47.20]Almost.
[117:47.76]He's hurt.
[117:48.62]He's hurt.
[117:49.12]I gotta get in front of him.
[117:50.12]He's limping.
[117:50.92]He's about to go off on the flight.
[117:52.16]No!
[117:54.38]No!
[117:58.04]I almost sniped him with the bug.
[118:01.28]There he goes.
[118:02.52]I want to get in front of him so I can just unload on his head.
[118:04.46]Are there any, like, speed buffs to make you, like, run faster and do stuff like that?
[118:10.70]Maybe the banjo.
[118:11.50]Oh, don't tell me he's going all the way up there.
[118:12.87]I'm going to have to climb some vines here, I think.
[118:15.37]Maybe not.
[118:18.19]Probably some, like, stamina regions.
[118:20.71]It takes so long to take the fucking gun out.
[118:22.27]Like, I'm not going to hit him for shit.
[118:24.47]Wait, maybe I will.
[118:26.67]Yeah, I'm gonna shoot him by the neck.
[118:32.56]Yes.
[118:32.72]One.
[118:33.22]Alright, I stopped him from healing.
[118:34.90]He's coming back down here.
[118:39.08]What?
[118:42.62]What about him?
[118:43.66]Yeah.
[118:44.08]Well, I'm on vacation right now.
[118:46.70]This is what I do on vacation.
[118:48.93]He's gotta come down.
[118:49.61]Shoot him in the egg sac.
[118:57.49]Oh, shit.
[118:58.17]I'm not paying attention to that.
[119:00.51]His tail is getting huge.
[119:02.89]How are you doing down there?
[119:06.69]You okay?
[119:08.39]I'm okay for now.
[119:09.43]I'm all good.
[119:10.47]I'm going to sit down and drink a couple of drinks.
[119:15.90]Okay, I finally unlocked my secret super final form.
[119:18.92]Okay, now let's go ahead and now I'm going to fucking unload the whole thing on his head.
[119:25.44]Okay, it would be nice if...
[119:28.23]I don't even care if I'm poisoned.
[119:29.83]I have a full fucking flip in this thing.
[119:33.87]I'm poisoned again, apparently.
[119:35.48]Okay.
[119:37.46]He's coming for me.
[119:38.04]Hey, draw some aggro.
[119:39.12]I'm trying.
[119:41.60]Grab him off of me.
[119:46.65]He's still, like, just attacking the cat.
[119:49.31]That fucking poison, man.
[119:51.33]Sucks such ass.
[119:51.93]That's so cool.
[120:02.99]Yeah, it does.
[120:03.63]He does like a sniper poison shot too.
[120:09.01]And it like dazes you for 10 seconds.
[120:11.77]Gonna get ready to space.
[120:15.49]Alright, it's my turn to have some drinks.
[120:19.64]Good luck down there.
[120:20.32]I'm watching.
[120:22.04]He's coming up.
[120:22.58]I think he's coming to you.
[120:29.28]I'm gonna die.
[120:31.59]You know one thing I completely forgot about?
[120:33.33]Is this game is hard?
[120:36.43]Analog aiming.
[120:38.31]Oh god, I'm gonna die.
[120:42.32]Give me this thing.
[120:44.68]Why does the bug disappear when I punch?
[120:46.44]Woah!
[120:47.22]I wanna heal with the bug!
[120:52.72]He's got it coming up.
[120:53.41]Yeah, this guy just has a really bad taste in fucking, like, norovirus.
[121:03.52]Under his belly.
[121:04.24]Alright, I don't want to be near that.
[121:09.24]He's doing so good.
[121:12.55]I didn't dodge that?
[121:13.73]Where is he?
[121:14.55]Where'd he go?
[121:15.63]Flying away?
[121:19.17]My sharpness.
[121:20.03]I didn't even have to fucking thing load it.
[121:21.84]Shit.
[121:23.70]Were you aiming for like a ball and sniper shot across the map?
[121:28.52]Can you use the heal shot on yourself?
[121:29.66]I don't think you can.
[121:32.67]I'm gonna mute for a sec.
[121:33.83]Mm-hmm.
[121:41.84]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[121:49.53]There he comes.
[121:55.93]Easy now.
[121:56.93]You know what?
[121:57.43]I'm just gonna do it.
[121:59.21]He's right here.
[121:59.67]I'm just gonna do him his butt.
[122:01.39]His face.
[122:05.37]Oh, that hurt.
[122:07.15]That hurt, like, so bad.
[122:08.89]Where was the splash there?
[122:09.95]I'm confused.
[122:19.21]He's dead.
[122:20.94]We didn't cut his tail off, though.
[122:29.06]Unfortunately for us.
[122:35.57]We did it.
[122:37.19]Loot Pukey Pukey.
[122:38.95]Pukey Pukey is dead.
[122:41.59]We win.
[122:43.81]How long does it take to kill a monster in this game?
[122:46.66]That long.
[122:47.80]This long.
[122:48.88]Usually between... By the way, do your skinning before the timer runs out.
[122:57.40]Poison whoopee cushion.
[122:59.31]I think I'm still poisoned.
[123:00.79]Hopefully I don't die.
[123:01.71]That'd be pretty funny, though, if I did die before the timer ran out.
[123:06.12]How much fun are we having?
[123:07.20]This is fun.
[123:08.16]This game's good.
[123:10.06]So, tell me how this compares to Monster Hunter Wii U. Uh, this is much more... Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[123:15.88]Don't go anywhere.
[123:16.54]Don't go anywhere.
[123:17.16]Part 2.
[123:18.06]He's right here.
[123:19.80]Oh, shit.
[123:22.56]Yeah.
[123:23.46]So, there's that.
[123:24.87]Oh, no.
[123:26.63]That's not cool.
[123:30.77]To be continued.
[123:34.39]I got some bonus awards.
[123:35.63]Cool.
[123:37.33]It takes, I would say, between like 15 and 25 minutes to kill a monster.
[123:42.83]Depending.
[123:46.95]Send it to the box.
[123:48.49]Hunter rank.
[123:51.50]Do you get like an S rank?
[123:53.28]Do you get like S plus?
[123:55.18]I don't know.
[123:56.02]Because I got an S rank.
[123:56.84]I don't know about you.
[123:59.22]Where does it show your rank?
[124:04.20]Where's the rank?
[124:05.44]Oh, just ignore the hunter highlights.
[124:07.18]It wasn't, you know... You got the target destroyer award, apparently.
[124:12.26]Target destroyer?
[124:13.62]I felt like I was contributing, though.
[124:16.36]Apparently you broke the most of his body.
[124:20.58]Three of his body parts.
[124:23.41]We have the right to take on level three assignments.
[124:30.27]Yes, playing in single player, the fights may be shorter.
[124:35.32]Because playing a multiplayer buffs the monsters.
[124:38.89]That's true.
[124:41.51]I'm a tracking whiz.
[124:44.29]I ran after him twice.
[124:47.52]I did mount him twice.
[124:48.64]I didn't get an award for that.
[124:50.38]I took his eyeball out and I broke his tail.
[124:55.38]I think.
[125:04.37]Take advantage of these situations when a monster will attack another monster.
[125:08.41]Multiplayer monsters have 2.6 times health.
[125:13.95]2.6?
[125:14.73]That's what somebody in the chat just said, I think.
[125:16.59]That's a very specific number.
[125:22.69]You've done well.
[125:25.45]Okay.
[125:27.36]Just to catch you up, we're hard on the trail of the Zora Mad Magdaros.
[125:32.56]We have... What?
[125:33.60]Are we?
[125:34.86]Are you in this cutscene?
[125:38.69]Was there a cutscene?
[125:40.49]With the commander?
[125:42.62]Oh.
[125:43.34]Yeah.
[125:43.88]Oh, yeah, we're on the tail of the Elder Dragon.
[125:45.88]Yeah, you came across the sea.
[125:47.36]You gotta find the Elder Dragon, just like Skyrim.
[125:51.68]Interesting.
[125:52.80]Alright, so we can... Let's... I have some bounties to turn in, apparently.
[125:59.12]I probably do, too.
[125:59.76]I'm gonna go back into the room and change weapons again.
[126:03.86]Change your weapons again?
[126:05.99]Yeah.
[126:06.85]My goodness, you.
[126:08.55]I know, I can't keep still.
[126:10.92]200 research points and a voucher.
[126:12.61]Secure the campsite.
[126:16.09]Get the plants four times.
[126:18.01]Armor, spear, and research points.
[126:19.23]Okay.
[126:20.61]Research points.
[126:21.25]Hunt a large monster.
[126:23.32]Hunt two large monsters.
[126:26.56]Okay, well there's a lot of... Is the next quest hunt three?
[126:29.78]Eat three insects.
[126:33.05]I think I ate the good bug.
[126:36.32]Alright, we have six days to do these other bounties that are new, apparently.
[126:39.54]Yes, we have.
[126:40.08]Those are the effectively, like, weeklies.
[126:44.47]Okay.
[126:44.81]From my understanding.
[126:46.71]That's cool.
[126:48.81]Manage investigations.
[126:52.18]So you can... What's this investigation thing?
[126:56.24]uh investigations are like a different remember how we were kind of probably like ah there's something weird in this area go figure it out you pick up the goo and the scent until you find the monster okay is my guess interesting should we have in any of these on or no I feel like I don't know how to do those in co-op delivery requests um
[127:24.91]Mix some honey.
[127:25.73]I did this already, right?
[127:28.33]Yeah.
[127:28.81]Give me the diced steak.
[127:29.90]Alright, give me one sec.
[127:33.28]Yeah, I'm gonna go buy some ammo.
[127:36.86]Okay.
[127:38.02]Let's go to the item box.
[127:40.58]I have a lot of random shit.
[127:44.12]Uh, auto-sort, please.
[127:46.33]Yes.
[127:49.13]That... That's already sorted, I guess.
[127:51.97]Okay.
[127:52.09]Okay.
[127:54.57]So I can make some spread ammo.
[127:56.41]Might as well make a ton of it.
[127:57.79]What do I need to make it?
[128:02.92]Item pouch and item box.
[128:07.20]I'd like to go in here.
[128:07.94]Okay.
[128:09.94]I have a lot of ammo in my box.
[128:11.30]I don't even need to buy any ammo.
[128:13.86]Let's load it up.
[128:21.41]I can't use this yet apparently.
[128:24.31]Spread ammo one.
[128:25.61]Spread ammo two is the one I'm going to be using.
[128:35.39]Sticky ammo.
[128:37.01]Cluster bomb.
[128:37.67]There we go.
[128:39.85]Put three in there.
[128:43.07]Why do these have X's?
[128:44.49]Does it mean I can't use them in the current weapon I have?
[128:51.86]I guess...
[128:58.03]Crafting list.
[128:58.97]Okay.
[128:59.39]Mega Potion.
[129:00.09]Potion.
[129:00.47]Herbal Medicine.
[129:00.97]Nutrients.
[129:01.41]Mega Nutrients.
[129:02.17]What is this?
[129:08.73]What is going on here?
[129:09.62]Whoa.
[129:10.20]We're going... I'm getting like pop-up ads.
[129:14.86]Mega Nutrients plus Mandragoria.
[129:18.22]I don't know what this is.
[129:19.38]I'm afraid to make it.
[129:27.75]Chat doesn't like video games anymore?
[129:29.63]What are you talking about?
[129:38.96]I mean, this is me playing a video game.
[129:41.24]That is true.
[129:44.98]Why do I want to make poisoned meat?
[129:55.23]Video games?
[129:55.97]How dare I take a video game slightly seriously on stream?
[130:00.83]How fucking dare I do this?
[130:03.41]Unbelievable.
[130:09.74]Send them to the fucking gallows.
[130:11.24]Alright, here we go.
[130:13.36]Poison Emo 2.
[130:16.24]It's Catalyst.
[130:18.39]Apparently I can make it.
[130:23.89]Bitterbug plus honey.
[130:26.01]Alright.
[130:27.67]I guess I just did this.
[130:28.49]I did it again.
[130:29.81]I just did it again.
[130:36.54]Poison ammo one.
[130:37.54]Wait, wait, wait.
[130:39.00]So you need to make catalysts to make poison ammo two.
[130:45.92]I understand.
[130:46.61]Okay.
[130:50.36]So to make a catalyst, you need six bugs and honey.
[130:56.24]Okay.
[131:00.40]Well, why not?
[131:03.11]Let's just have six of them for fun.
[131:11.05]Sell items.
[131:11.73]I don't think I want to sell anything.
[131:18.53]I want slicer ammo.
[131:19.51]I can just buy slicer ammo, I think.
[131:21.59]Can I?
[131:23.89]Let's find out.
[131:24.85]Can I just buy it?
[131:26.54]Alright, where are we?
[131:28.84]I'm just kind of making random shit.
[131:32.84]I'll try this weapon for this mission.
[131:36.20]Where is the provision person?
[131:40.20]Item box.
[131:42.83]Provisions!
[131:43.95]Literally right in front of me.
[131:45.97]Hi there.
[131:53.02]Can't use the ammo with that gun.
[131:54.22]Yeah.
[131:56.18]Yeah.
[131:57.14]This is like such a Bloodborne weapon.
[132:00.83]Spread ammo.
[132:01.59]You don't have it, do you?
[132:05.65]Normal ammo.
[132:06.79]No.
[132:07.23]Slicing ammo.
[132:08.17]Can't use it.
[132:11.31]So I cannot use it with this gun.
[132:13.09]That sucks.
[132:16.23]I can't even use wyvern ammo.
[132:21.10]It's all good.
[132:25.28]Is this game any good?
[132:26.22]It actually is very fun.
[132:28.08]I'm having a good time playing this game.
[132:31.56]It's a relaxing game.
[132:32.80]It's interesting.
[132:34.46]It gets intense.
[132:36.69]It's fun.
[132:39.31]Alright, do I have... I have plenty of normal ammo, plenty of piercing ammo.
[132:42.81]I can't even use piercing ammo 2 for some reason.
[132:47.16]So, I can do spread ammo 1.
[132:54.88]I can't even really take it off, can I?
[132:56.80]I guess I can, right?
[133:02.88]Let's just... Let's clean it up.
[133:05.72]So it's not so hard to... I don't even want spread ammo 1.
[133:11.16]I might have it.
[133:15.49]Wait, what the fuck's going on?
[133:19.29]There we go.
[133:19.77]Spread ammo 2.
[133:23.80]So I got normal ammo two, pierce armor one, spread ammo two, uh, sticky ammo's already there, cluster bomb's already there, take off the other shit I can't even use.
[133:35.39]Why even have it?
[133:43.32]Inventory management stream.
[133:48.96]Uh, that's fine.
[133:52.35]Where is it?
[133:52.75]Recovery?
[133:53.51]It's already here.
[133:56.37]So is that going to fuck me up?
[133:59.35]It shouldn't, right?
[134:01.37]Does it have to be cleanly up there?
[134:05.61]This is giving me anxiety.
[134:06.99]I'm going to move this over here.
[134:08.47]Rearrange.
[134:15.40]Okay.
[134:16.64]There we go.
[134:19.04]Now it all makes sense.
[134:23.08]Pet the peg?
[134:23.60]What peg?
[134:27.21]Pet the peg.
[134:32.51]You can use Wyvern?
[134:34.49]Are you sure about that?
[134:38.58]There was a... The special move on this thing is supposed to be some Wyvern ammo or something, but why is it X'd out?
[134:49.06]Wyvern ammo.
[134:49.70]Yeah, I can't use it.
[134:52.06]I can't use Slicing or Wyvern.
[134:58.08]Let's auto-sort it.
[134:58.94]Yeah, that's a better idea, too.
[135:02.23]Auto-sort.
[135:03.85]Auto-sort.
[135:06.59]Pet the pig.
[135:07.63]Where's this pig?
[135:08.35]I don't see a pig.
[135:10.89]Where's the pig?
[135:11.93]Where is he?
[135:15.13]Oh, this pig.
[135:16.47]Alright, let's pet the pig.
[135:21.95]He just didn't know where the wild things are.
[135:24.67]Costume.
[135:27.70]Alright, that was not nice.
[135:28.72]Alright, that was dumb.
[135:33.04]You're so tough.
[135:33.90]Yeah, Monster Hunter.
[135:35.22]This thing's technically a monster.
[135:37.34]Why don't I, like, fucking take him and throw him overboard?
[135:44.71]Let me take a look at the upgrades, too.
[135:45.89]Just in case I can do another gun.
[135:46.97]Because I really want to use the other ammo.
[135:49.09]I feel like the other ammo's good.
[135:52.85]And we've got to go up to... There's a lot of things to do.
[135:57.25]Canteen.
[135:57.81]Where's the forge?
[135:58.97]Right here.
[135:59.85]So I've got to go up the weird snaky path.
[136:01.71]Hey.
[136:02.77]Hello.
[136:04.21]The charged sword is currently the most insane weapon, but also the most difficult.
[136:08.69]Wait, are you changing weapons again?
[136:10.85]Not to this one, because I don't think I'm good enough.
[136:14.15]Well.
[136:15.37]Well?
[136:15.65]I'm going to go back to practicing with the charged lance, or the gun lance.
[136:19.79]Can we play the game?
[136:21.35]Yeah.
[136:24.00]There's a time for practice, and there's a time for killing monsters, Etalyx.
[136:26.66]Okay, when I came back, uh, three minutes ago, you were currently, uh, uh, do I, like, scattershot, or do I want, like, a charge ammo?
[136:34.11]Yeah, because I was waiting for you!
[136:35.23]I don't know!
[136:36.05]And so I was like, okay, I guess I better go train some more, because this guy with the gun over here has, like, 30 different types of ammunitions he has to craft, like this is Minecraft.
[136:45.28]I was waiting for you to be done with what you were doing.
[136:47.36]You said you'd be right back.
[136:48.08]I was waiting for you.
[136:50.11]Bullshit!
[136:53.26]Alright, so let's start the next mission.
[136:57.47]Go ahead.
[136:58.29]I've started every mission up until now.
[137:01.81]You should do it.
[137:02.41]Watch your attitude, buddy.
[137:04.57]Hey, listen, I'm just trying to have fun.
[137:07.99]You know, a couple of humans having fun playing a new video game, alright?
[137:12.09]Some of us are trying to, like, speed run.
[137:14.77]Wait, I thought it was my problem.
[137:16.59]I thought it was my fault that we're not starting.
[137:20.96]I'm trying to give the people what they want.
[137:22.23]What they want is Jerma crap.
[137:24.07]Alright, I'm ready.
[137:28.11]I'm gonna start it.
[137:32.29]Blink twice if you're a soundboard.
[137:38.43]I'm loading in.
[137:39.45]I think we're both doing the same thing.
[137:41.97]To the main world.
[137:45.80]So what's this one?
[137:50.59]Poogie.
[137:52.39]Poogie.
[137:54.59]Alright, I'm gonna post a new quest.
[137:56.63]Here we go.
[138:01.48]Did you see Poogie?
[138:02.60]I did.
[138:03.20]He's a dick.
[138:03.78]He knocks you over.
[138:04.46]Alright, the best kind of quest.
[138:08.94]Players.
[138:09.92]Two.
[138:10.72]Passcode.
[138:11.64]No.
[138:12.16]Right?
[138:13.52]Uh, correct.
[138:15.24]Alright.
[138:15.90]Accept this quest.
[138:16.93]Are you ready?
[138:18.63]I am ready.
[138:19.17]I'm sitting right here.
[138:20.56]Here we go.
[138:21.92]Quest accepted.
[138:31.12]Pre-recorded Jupiter.
[138:32.12]What's the name of your quest?
[138:34.01]The best kind of quest.
[138:38.43]Well, that is also the quest I am supposed to be on, but it says I cannot join you because... What?
[138:45.19]You cannot join this because you have not progressed enough in the story.
[138:49.21]What?
[138:50.32]That's what the game says.
[138:51.76]Wait, what, what, what, what?
[138:53.76]Hang on, let me try accepting it first.
[139:03.72]This is supposed to be the best kind of quest.
[139:08.75]One out of one.
[139:09.33]Alright, well, what happens if I accept it here?
[139:12.23]Etalyx has posted a quest.
[139:14.93]How do I cancel this one?
[139:17.73]I can leave mine.
[139:19.55]And then... It says you just posted one.
[139:22.27]Well, I canceled it.
[139:23.63]Okay.
[139:27.81]Yeah, it says I have not progressed enough in the story.
[139:32.05]I'm not progressive enough.
[139:33.63]So what happens if... I'm going to leave my quest.
[139:37.65]So you post one now.
[139:39.79]I will post one.
[139:45.36]Tell me when it's there.
[139:47.50]Uh, it is now there.
[139:49.76]Okay.
[139:54.06]Signed.
[139:54.42]Uh, you cannot join this quest because you have not progressed enough in the story.
[139:58.91]Yeah.
[140:01.47]Correct.
[140:02.07]I think this is the part where we have to, like, depart.
[140:07.07]And...
[140:08.96]I can go ahead and depart and then invite you to my quest after we both... We probably have to watch the cutscene.
[140:13.27]Remember?
[140:13.67]Everyone kept telling us.
[140:14.91]Oh, right.
[140:15.57]We have to do the cutscene first.
[140:17.59]Okay.
[140:19.15]So if you just go, do you get a cutscene?
[140:23.07]If I go, I load in and probably get a cutscene.
[140:26.57]We have to do an SOS.
[140:29.14]Why do they have to make it this complicated?
[140:30.66]I don't know.
[140:32.70]Apparently there's a technical limitation to doing a campaign consecutively back-to-back.
[140:38.28]So we have to watch cutscenes in our own games?
[140:40.99]Why can't it just be like... Come on, man.
[140:44.51]Hey, Star Wars The Old Republic did this six years ago.
[140:49.87]We need to watch the cutscene first and send an SOS signal.
[140:53.41]There is indeed a cutscene.
[140:54.85]So... So we both have to watch this cutscene.
[140:58.56]It's basically like, hey, it's a new area.
[141:00.96]Isn't it pretty?
[141:02.08]And then... And then you gotta talk to Ashley Birch.
[141:08.07]I can't join you.
[141:11.05]I can't respond to your SOS.
[141:13.05]Because I haven't sent one.
[141:14.27]Okay.
[141:14.77]But I also have to watch this cutscene.
[141:16.75]You may as well just go on the quest and watch the cutscene.
[141:20.92]Jesus.
[141:21.34]Wait.
[141:30.32]Just in case.
[141:33.62]Alright.
[141:34.18]Here we go.
[141:34.72]I'm like escorting something.
[141:38.63]Yeah, this is an escort quest.
[141:41.17]Alright.
[141:43.05]I'm departing.
[141:43.65]Let's go watch the cutscene.
[141:46.83]Let's see.
[141:47.55]Cannot do SOS.
[141:48.82]It will be available after the cutscene, etc.
[141:51.28]I like etc.
[141:53.46]Like, alright.
[141:54.66]It'll be ready after you see the cutscene.
[141:57.10]Then you can play.
[142:06.80]Can you accept an SOS while doing a mission?
[142:08.96]That's a good question.
[142:10.10]Maybe.
[142:10.68]Maybe not.
[142:12.84]As long as you're not in a cutscene, I believe, you can abandon your quest and join someone else's.
[142:21.05]And you will get the same rewards as the person you join, as long as you join within 10 minutes of them starting.
[142:26.81]Here is a cutscene.
[142:28.97]Shit.
[142:34.09]This place looks cool.
[142:35.82]Yeah.
[142:37.34]Is yours nighttime too?
[142:38.58]Yeah.
[142:43.49]Still didn't look and see how to set, leave the cats at home.
[142:46.31]Keep forgetting to do that.
[142:48.63]What's in the, are those the cats that are pushing this?
[142:52.95]It does seem to sound that way based on their
[142:58.77]Similarity to young soy.
[143:00.35]Oh man.
[143:01.21]We actually have to you weren't kidding This is like a defend the researchers.
[143:07.46]This is it.
[143:07.80]It's like an interactive cutscene Alright Okay, I'll do it It's dusk not night what that what the hell do you think what are you what?
[143:23.69]Somebody just called me an idiot for thinking it was nighttime.
[143:26.37]Oh
[143:27.54]I think it's nighttime.
[143:29.62]There's crickets and shit.
[143:30.92]It's like stars in the sky.
[143:33.74]It's definitely nighttime.
[143:35.58]I was just called stupid for saying night.
[143:38.60]That's the best kind of night.
[143:40.50]Listen, dusk is when you can still see the sun.
[143:44.27]Dusk to me is when... You know dawn and dusk.
[143:47.73]Dawn is when the sun comes up.
[143:48.97]Dusk is when the sun is going down.
[143:50.37]Do you see any sun in the sky?
[143:52.49]Stupid.
[144:00.36]When do we get attacked?
[144:04.60]There are always stars in the sky.
[144:06.88]Alright, if you tied me up, and like, put a cannonball launcher against my head, and said, Sir, what is it outside right now?
[144:19.33]I'm gonna say it's night.
[144:23.20]And if that guy takes my head off with a cannonball,
[144:26.20]I'm sorry.
[144:27.18]I would have saved Knight a thousand times.
[144:38.17]Cannonball launcher.
[144:40.05]Why a cannonball launcher?
[144:41.83]Like a cannon.
[144:42.69]You mean a cannon.
[144:43.91]Yeah.
[144:46.88]No, a slingshot.
[144:49.24]The viewer is always right.
[144:51.06]Yeah, that's true.
[144:53.92]It's working in retail.
[144:55.81]The chat is always right.
[144:57.47]But see, the thing about that is the customer is always right, is actually.
[145:02.75]So, only subs.
[145:06.13]Oh, God.
[145:08.26]Bullet shooter.
[145:11.10]Yeah, watch out for that bullet shooting device.
[145:15.77]Surely I don't have to fight this guy like this.
[145:18.31]Surely you can't be serious.
[145:19.53]I am serious.
[145:20.39]Don't call me Shirley.
[145:21.25]Remember that movie that came out in 1980?
[145:25.54]Airplane?
[145:31.40]This is a good collection of material stream.
[145:36.02]We made it.
[145:37.34]Can we have a break now?
[145:42.08]Here we go.
[145:44.60]Nighttime.
[145:46.04]Nice reference.
[145:50.70]Wait, this guy can talk?
[145:52.96]That cat can talk.
[145:53.91]Oh, that's not... Is that a cat?
[145:58.31]It is.
[145:58.59]That's a cat.
[146:04.41]I love how I'm not even helping and I'm the Monster Hunter.
[146:10.80]I'm just getting in the way.
[146:19.22]I want to get inside.
[146:20.16]It'd be even worse.
[146:25.99]Wait, no.
[146:26.67]I didn't just notice this cat.
[146:28.77]What are you... I noticed this guy.
[146:30.67]This guy was talking.
[146:32.91]Come on!
[146:37.60]I'll check it out.
[146:38.30]First, let me pick up some tough-skinned fruit.
[146:42.52]AKA a pineapple.
[146:48.12]Who's screaming?
[146:52.44]Hold on.
[146:53.32]I'll get it.
[146:53.92]I'll get to it in a minute.
[147:03.01]Oh no, it's a Wrathion.
[147:07.34]Do we have to do this by ourselves?
[147:08.70]I don't think I... Can I fight this thing alone?
[147:11.80]Oh, boy.
[147:12.82]Well... Uh... I don't think I need to kill this.
[147:15.36]You know, you're right.
[147:17.58]I'm going to use my slinger.
[147:21.57]You know what?
[147:22.55]I'm trying to just...
[147:35.98]Hey look, over there!
[147:37.52]Wait, what was that?
[147:40.36]Go over there!
[147:44.86]He was just dawning on us.
[147:46.46]He was about to kill us and then he heard a rock behind him and that was enough to distract him.
[147:56.73]There's like five delicious meals right here.
[148:00.75]There was a rock sound!
[148:02.92]What was that?
[148:05.28]We're good.
[148:09.77]Stupid monster.
[148:12.49]They don't have that high intelligence, guys.
[148:16.13]They're just monsters.
[148:20.84]Wait, hopefully I'm not bringing them over here.
[148:27.72]Isn't a rathian a really, really difficult monster to kill in this game?
[148:40.01]For a second, I thought that was blood.
[148:42.24]Holy shit, man.
[148:42.94]And this is really... Come on, man.
[148:46.22]Escort missions.
[148:48.74]Am I right?
[148:49.30]I didn't say anything.
[148:52.78]Let's go pick up some more pits.
[148:54.44]What?
[148:54.60]This Deckard came.
[149:04.42]Ah, yeah, a stack of cane.
[149:07.58]You have quite a treasure there in that Haradric Butte.
[149:11.83]According to the Haradric, if you put gems in there, you'll get topaz.
[149:19.41]Uh-oh, Rathian.
[149:21.56]Wait.
[149:24.00]Stop auto-locking.
[149:27.24]Are they going to, you know,
[149:35.83]Stay a while or miss it.
[149:45.64]Shit.
[149:46.54]That was just mean.
[149:48.26]That was just very rude.
[149:49.76]That's all that was.
[149:52.26]That guy was just breathing heavily.
[150:00.99]You love how much I reference Diablo II.
[150:02.57]Diablo II is one of my favorite games ever.
[150:05.92]Herbivore, not herbivore.
[150:07.14]Yeah, see?
[150:09.08]Alright.
[150:09.52]Are you at the thing?
[150:10.16]Tell me when you're at the thing.
[150:10.98]I'm just walking along with this thing.
[150:12.92]Listen, you'll know when you're at the thing because I'm going to have to, like... I don't think I can pause.
[150:16.70]No, I cannot pause.
[150:17.60]But I can... There's a thing we can do together.
[150:19.45]There is.
[150:20.33]You'll know it when you see it.
[150:21.97]Did it... Okay.
[150:23.89]What was with that, like... What's with the anime, like, moaning you're doing here?
[150:28.15]You'll see, okay?
[150:30.01]You just got to wait, like, another five minutes.
[150:32.43]Alright.
[150:33.97]Another five minutes.
[150:35.74]Well, however long it takes you to get out of wherever you're in.
[150:38.48]I'm in the quicksand patch.
[150:39.64]I'm having to delay so hard right now.
[150:43.84]Is it the quicksand patch?
[150:45.26]I'm looking at a cutscene.
[150:46.42]This is not possible.
[150:49.50]Is it before or after the second cutscene?
[150:51.06]It's after the cutscene.
[150:53.32]Okay.
[150:58.17]Oh dear.
[150:59.19]I've made a grave mistake.
[151:01.13]Does it have anything to do with the Wrathion?
[151:07.31]They are cats.
[151:12.16]Help, please.
[151:13.02]How am I supposed to help you?
[151:14.76]I'm stuck in a cutscene.
[151:16.32]Help.
[151:20.74]He'll never find me in this cactus.
[151:25.10]There he is.
[151:25.62]This thing.
[151:28.16]They're not cats.
[151:36.45]Alright, so I'm at the Hammerhead Shark.
[151:38.97]Yep, I can really use an SOS flare going out here in a second, so let me figure out how to send that.
[151:44.70]I'm going to send an SOS flare.
[151:46.62]He's going to hit me.
[151:48.80]What did I just do?
[151:51.16]SOS is up.
[151:51.78]I need help requesting backup.
[151:53.97]How come when I do that, it doesn't do anything?
[151:57.21]Did you get an SOS?
[151:59.05]Can you join me?
[152:00.05]I'm still in the cutscene.
[152:01.35]Oh.
[152:02.75]Well, the SOS is up.
[152:04.65]SOS is up.
[152:05.81]You can now use the SOS flare.
[152:07.65]I've already used mine, so I don't know how you join me.
[152:13.11]Let's see here.
[152:14.55]SOS.
[152:15.05]Call for help.
[152:16.45]Join requests.
[152:18.35]I have no requests.
[152:21.31]Try that one more time.
[152:23.83]Return quest info.
[152:26.65]I have to cancel SOS flare.
[152:28.75]What if I fire one?
[152:30.95]The quest is password locked.
[152:32.73]Players can join without the password.
[152:36.75]Are you broadcasting or announcing that?
[152:38.37]I just... No, I think I just shot... Did I shoot a flare?
[152:44.54]What if I just go back to the camp?
[152:50.66]Really, they can hit you in the middle of firing the SOS animation.
[152:54.75]Alright, well I'm doing one too.
[152:55.67]I'm gonna die.
[153:04.24]Oh come on, wake up!
[153:07.40]Alright, I fired another SOS to try to queue you up.
[153:11.88]I think he's distracted.
[153:15.06]He's running away now.
[153:15.92]He got bored.
[153:16.96]Is he bored of you?
[153:17.62]He's not bored of me yet.
[153:19.12]He's bored of me now.
[153:20.24]Took like 10 minutes.
[153:21.34]Okay.
[153:23.24]Cancel.
[153:23.82]I saw Wes.
[153:24.38]I think you have to go back to the lobby or I have to go back to join.
[153:28.64]Somebody said just go.
[153:31.46]Can I just like go fast travel to the camp?
[153:34.94]What the hell is that?
[153:36.28]That's me.
[153:38.16]That's me.
[153:39.47]That's me.
[153:43.12]I'm going to have to lose here.
[153:44.02]Alright, just go.
[153:48.91]Is there even a camp in this area set up yet?
[153:51.05]I'm not sure there is.
[153:51.83]Yeah, there is.
[153:55.00]Didn't we just?
[153:55.84]Okay, there is.
[153:56.38]I can't.
[153:56.84]You can't fast.
[153:59.18]I can fast travel.
[154:00.04]I can't fast travel.
[154:00.96]I'm not in combat anymore.
[154:02.18]Okay, you fast travel.
[154:02.92]Oh, God.
[154:03.16]I'm going to try.
[154:04.00]I have to stay alive.
[154:06.13]And join on you somehow.
[154:09.93]I'm going to cancel my own flare.
[154:11.11]I have a flare set up right now.
[154:13.97]Running around from the monster.
[154:15.89]So if you go back to the lobby... I have no join request.
[154:18.89]I'm going to try my... Jesus Christ.
[154:22.92]Yeah.
[154:23.16]Oh, come on.
[154:23.64]I keep fucking moving.
[154:34.22]I still have one there.
[154:35.99]I have an SOS there.
[154:41.78]I love that those people were depending on me to slay the monster, and I just abandoned them.
[154:48.58]I've wasted two mega potions, yeah, because I was moving.
[154:54.39]I have very pleasant elevator music right now while I... Stop wasting potions.
[154:59.25]Well, yeah, how about this?
[155:00.95]How about this for an idea?
[155:02.98]Why does the fucking party system have to be this stupid?
[155:08.90]Like, what the fuck?
[155:10.71]Make sure you put an SOS flare on, and you gotta go back to the main menu.
[155:13.74]And then, you know, go together, but you have to be honest.
[155:15.30]Watch the cutscene first.
[155:16.58]You didn't see that cutscene?
[155:17.58]Oh, well, you have to go back to the fucking lobby.
[155:20.12]Give me a break.
[155:22.44]True.
[155:25.66]That is true.
[155:34.35]So, he left me.
[155:36.99]Yeah.
[155:37.53]He's gone now.
[155:40.69]Uh, okay.
[155:41.63]How do I... I don't see the lobby.
[155:50.50]You can't be... Wait, hold on.
[155:51.68]You can't be in a story mission to join an SOS request.
[155:57.76]That seems oddly specific.
[156:02.60]Dude, the monster got bored of me, too.
[156:04.08]Here's respond to SOS.
[156:06.00]Wait, this is for other people, though.
[156:07.90]Are you sure it's not me?
[156:10.06]Oh, so you can actually just respond to other people's SOS.
[156:13.00]Alright, well, how about this?
[156:13.80]What if I just leave?
[156:16.10]I'm going to, like... Everything... Okay, no.
[156:22.21]Return from quest.
[156:23.83]How funny would it be if we have to do the whole escort again?
[156:26.99]I'm going to be kind of... That's going to make me very angry.
[156:32.82]Okay, so I'm going to return from the quest.
[156:36.72]The quest won't count as completed.
[156:38.86]If Jerma leaves, you both have to do it all over again, says Crap Sage.
[156:42.99]Okay, I'm going to fire my SOS Flare.
[156:53.60]Alright, join a quest.
[156:55.21]With a join available, assigned the best kind of quest, except... Am I in your party?
[157:04.81]Join request settings finished.
[157:07.27]You're here.
[157:07.87]Oh my god, you're here.
[157:11.62]It only took two college-educated people to figure out how to do this.
[157:16.58]I have a degree!
[157:19.89]How many fucking college degrees does it take to figure out how to do an SOS club?
[157:25.13]Alright, so where are you now?
[157:32.04]It's that easy.
[157:34.46]Uh, I'm loading.
[157:39.29]We have a combined, like, 197 IQ.
[157:40.67]Yeah.
[157:40.81]I'm the 100.

[158:25.07]All you say, Nate34k, is hi.

[158:43.24]That was five minutes ago.
[158:44.76]But where are you?
[158:46.16]Happy birthday, Nate, by the way.
[158:52.28]I'm becoming very aware of something here.
[158:55.93]Is this timed?
[159:00.11]Is it timed?
[159:02.91]This might be timed.
[159:06.89]Where's the timer?
[159:07.93]Is there a timer?
[159:08.61]Alright.
[159:12.07]Cooking up some food.
[159:13.31]If you want to just come back to camp, fast travel here, and then we can just set out from here.
[159:18.50]Is this timed?
[159:20.69]Is it?
[159:21.35]This might be timed.
[159:23.61]Do you see a timer anywhere?
[159:24.89]I don't know.
[159:25.69]Somebody said 35 minutes.
[159:26.91]Where's the timer?
[159:28.01]It's not going to take that long.
[159:29.17]Yes, it is.
[159:30.05]You eat.
[159:31.79]I'm going to go.
[159:33.19]I'm going to find him, man.
[159:34.51]Look, I'm eating a delicious fish meal.
[159:40.50]Hold on.
[159:40.86]Bottom right corner of the map screen.
[159:43.32]And I bet I'm going to eat and find him before you.
[159:47.05]Yes, Etalyx, we have 34 minutes to beat this mission.
[159:50.91]Piece of cake.
[159:53.85]You got to get over here.
[159:55.35]Nothing.
[159:55.75]That's nothing.
[159:57.92]You have a watch on you.
[159:59.16]You don't appear on the minimap.
[160:00.96]I'm just tracking the monster.
[160:03.22]Oh, never mind.
[160:03.76]Yeah, I'm on the minimap.
[160:04.58]I should be.
[160:06.58]I see you.
[160:10.34]I'm just going to creep up on him and just sneak over here.
[160:16.72]Alright, I'm on the way.
[160:18.58]I'll wait for you, but I'm going to take a lot of stuff along the way here.
[160:28.13]You craving a meatball sub right now?
[160:29.33]Can you fast travel to a party member?
[160:31.69]Actually, that sounds really good right now, actually.
[160:33.57]$100 meatball sub, happy birthday.
[160:36.97]But I can set a waypoint.
[160:39.02]It's back here.
[160:40.82]So I can put a pin in you, and then my flies will do the rest.
[160:45.94]This is true.
[160:47.32]You are probably pretty far away.
[160:49.62]Not really.
[160:50.08]Slow down.
[160:53.76]No, you're right here.
[160:54.50]I am right here.
[160:56.36]That's why I said not really.
[160:57.62]Wait, hold on.
[160:58.82]Is this... Why are there like... There's like a ton of markers on the screen right now.
[161:04.70]I want to mark him.
[161:07.94]Alright, so I think that was me marking to you.
[161:10.66]Alright, let's go.
[161:12.94]Did you track him?
[161:13.76]How's your tracking going?
[161:15.23]going pretty good he's down here I've got a feeling we're not gonna be able to hit this guy in the head we're gonna have to take out his legs I think okay so you're gonna have to go with a sweep attack and I'm gonna go with the right I got sweep make sure you have a sweep unlocked I've also got a gun we both have guns do you have a gun my gun's a little close range though oh you have the gun lance yes
[161:41.14]Please fight a monster already.
[161:43.42]I would have loved to do that.
[161:46.02]In the beginning, if we could have just stayed in a party together.
[161:48.98]We fought like four monsters.
[161:50.89]It's not our fault that you came to the stream like three hours after it started.
[161:55.13]No, no, no.
[161:56.09]It's not anybody's fault.
[161:57.31]It's the fault of needing to have a stupid party system.
[161:59.97]It's his fault.
[162:00.79]No, it's nobody's fault.
[162:01.75]Stop saying it's anybody's fault.
[162:03.92]If I was in your chat right now, I would ban him personally.
[162:06.56]No, you would not do that.
[162:07.54]I would refuse that.
[162:08.80]Just focus on the monster, please.
[162:12.44]This one?
[162:12.80]Alright.
[162:13.66]What am I doing?
[162:16.04]Why is he not seeing us?
[162:19.48]I believe he does see us.
[162:20.50]I did one... Oh, no I didn't.
[162:23.09]I did a little more damage than that.
[162:24.07]I think you just shot me back with your attack, actually.
[162:27.69]Good.
[162:28.29]That means it's working.
[162:29.07]Alright, look at his legs.
[162:29.79]Looks like he has problems with his legs.
[162:32.45]He has leg issues.
[162:33.25]Water blight.
[162:35.53]Yeah, this guy's got leg problems.
[162:37.69]I'm thinking about legs and arms situation here.
[162:40.22]Looks like they're pretty muscular.
[162:46.12]Making my job a little hard here.
[162:49.28]What about his neck?
[162:50.22]Yeah, it looks like neck too.
[162:51.26]What about right inside of his mouth hole?
[162:54.00]Oh, god damn it.
[162:54.70]I missed.
[162:57.04]I missed.
[162:57.68]I missed.
[163:05.64]Keep attacking Jermas.
[163:07.06]Do I get to do something?
[163:09.10]Don't attack me anymore.
[163:10.02]Let's do some spread.
[163:12.84]You know what?
[163:13.17]Let's just go for it.
[163:16.96]I'm ready.
[163:17.40]I'm loaded with my super ammo.
[163:20.25]Bring him over here.
[163:22.83]Should I knock the mud off his tail?
[163:31.31]Oh, that's a scary yell.
[163:32.91]It is, yeah.
[163:33.53]It hurt my ears.
[163:37.98]It's definitely his neck.
[163:38.98]His neck is vulnerable, it seems.
[163:42.50]Oh, that neck?
[163:43.32]Yeah, that neck.
[163:47.47]He's doing the dog shake after he got out of a bath.
[163:49.47]That's perfect.
[163:49.91]He is, and all the mud, like, sucks.
[163:52.10]Yeah, now all we... Oh, come on.
[163:54.20]What we gotta wait for now, Talos, is once a dog gets out of a bath and they shake, then they start to get... Oh, you're in... Okay, no more jokes.
[163:59.86]No jokes right now.
[164:01.46]I'm being pulled out on a stretcher.
[164:04.12]Wait, where... What?
[164:06.13]I, uh, am back...
[164:08.58]At camp.
[164:09.62]Are you serious?
[164:11.56]Hold on.
[164:12.34]Is there like a revive your friend thing?
[164:14.60]No.
[164:15.54]This is serious.
[164:16.18]This is serious business.
[164:17.46]This is serious business.
[164:18.64]Yeah.
[164:19.38]I'm dead.
[164:22.96]Okay.
[164:23.50]Well, I'm still here.
[164:26.02]And you probably like lose stuff too.
[164:30.20]Uh-oh.
[164:32.51]Oh, it sure is.
[164:33.89]Oh, it sure is.
[164:37.66]I only have two more lives.
[164:39.66]Oh, it sure is.
[164:40.54]This is harder than Mario.
[164:43.82]I have so much trash in my inventory.
[164:47.68]He's going to do a dive.
[164:49.70]Do it.
[164:50.27]You don't lose anything.
[164:51.93]Oh, I have too much stuff in my inventory.
[164:56.25]Alright.
[164:56.73]Well, time to find you again.
[165:00.95]This guy looks like... What does he look like?
[165:08.68]Someone you know?
[165:09.48]This guy looks like somebody I know.
[165:10.78]Look at that neck.
[165:17.28]You know what?
[165:18.34]We're going to play it safe here until you get here.
[165:20.03]I'm going to do some just cluster bombs on him.
[165:25.93]Bone pile.
[165:26.87]I'm going to be very, very cautious here.
[165:29.71]Oh.
[165:30.17]I'm almost there.
[165:31.23]What?
[165:32.07]Now you're dead.
[165:33.23]No.
[165:34.52]Sorry.
[165:35.24]That was a perfect dodge.
[165:37.20]That was a perfect dodge.
[165:40.47]Sorry.
[165:41.37]Give me a break.
[165:45.73]That's fucking horseshit.
[165:48.07]That's a horseshit.
[165:51.73]I can't fucking what.
[165:55.90]Shout outs.
[165:58.58]Literally, that was a perfect dodge.
[166:03.12]It couldn't have been any better.
[166:07.56]Wait, there's no iframes on any dodges.
[166:09.40]There isn't.
[166:11.90]Hold on.
[166:12.48]There's zero iframes in this game.
[166:15.36]It's actually good to know.
[166:18.87]Pull that back.
[166:20.01]Pull that shit back.
[166:21.17]And watch that.
[166:23.35]Wonderful.
[166:24.57]Oh, hey, look!
[166:25.23]Pet the pig, Jeremy!
[166:26.63]Let's go ahead and pet the fucking pig!
[166:28.37]Alright, let me know when you get back, because I'm not going to engage him until you find me.
[166:35.56]Goddammit.
[166:36.48]What was the point of that?
[166:42.83]He's not even mad.
[166:47.53]What a great chat system.
[166:50.11]Wait, what did you do?
[166:51.87]I was chatting to you.
[166:53.55]You are?
[166:53.89]Mm-hmm.
[166:56.39]He survived.
[166:57.27]That is so far away.
[167:00.23]We're not going to do it.
[167:01.59]We have 27 minutes to beat this.
[167:08.77]Hey, honestly, though, if by this point in the game we hadn't died, I would have wondered about, like, Monster Hunter, not that tough anyway.
[167:17.67]I didn't expect to die in one hit at, like, full health.
[167:21.67]You were at full health?
[167:22.47]I got hit at least four times.
[167:24.97]He did one charge.
[167:26.13]I dodged out of the way very, like, skillfully.
[167:29.21]But the game has no iframes, so it was a very skillful iframe dodge.
[167:34.07]And he killed me instantly in one hit.
[167:39.12]Alright, I'm here.
[167:39.64]Are you here?
[167:40.00]I am here.
[167:42.86]Okay, I'm currently here.
[167:45.47]I'm ready to unload.
[167:46.19]Alright, where are you?
[167:49.47]Oh, I see.
[167:49.79]You're on the opposite side.
[167:50.55]Alright, so you want me to engage?
[167:52.63]Let's sneak over here first.
[167:53.65]Let's play this smart.
[167:55.67]He might have heard me.
[167:57.03]He definitely turned around fast.
[168:00.11]Okay, I'm going to play.
[168:01.21]He's looking at me right now.
[168:02.04]He's smelling me.
[168:03.50]I'm thinking about shooting him right in the mouth.
[168:05.66]Nope.
[168:06.38]I don't think he has any eyes.
[168:07.86]I don't think he can see.
[168:10.56]Maybe he's just not aggressive unless he gets attacked.
[168:13.54]By the way, excuse me, 27 minutes.
[168:15.93]So we have to make this happen.
[168:17.23]Hey, I'm ready.
[168:18.63]Do we want to fight him on a hill, though?
[168:20.45]Okay.
[168:22.35]I'll let you get the party started.
[168:27.15]We have to start to hurt him.
[168:28.63]We have to break him.
[168:33.35]Here we go.
[168:33.87]I'm going for the neck.
[168:40.08]Okay, he's down.
[168:41.46]He's hurt.
[168:41.72]No, he's not.
[168:42.18]What?
[168:42.38]That was very deceiving.
[168:43.70]That was very deceiving.
[168:45.33]Oh, no.
[168:47.55]Dude, that was extraordinarily deceiving.
[168:51.67]He did like a, oh, I'm down.
[168:55.59]We're like fighting him on a mountainside.
[169:00.90]And I keep sliding down it.
[169:02.30]Oh, here comes the mud.
[169:10.19]You know, it's his hands.
[169:12.19]Is it his hands?
[169:12.83]His baby hands?
[169:13.53]I think it's his baby hands.
[169:17.31]It's definitely his baby hands.
[169:19.45]Got greedy.
[169:21.91]Okay, watch it.
[169:22.41]Don't die.
[169:23.87]I'm dead.
[169:25.17]You're dead?
[169:25.79]No, I'm not.
[169:26.11]I'm okay.
[169:26.75]Just don't do that again.
[169:28.25]I'm coming.
[169:31.01]Put the gun down.
[169:34.27]That was awesome.
[169:34.99]How do I do that again?
[169:37.71]Alright, he's armored on the legs.
[169:38.99]Don't do it.
[169:42.69]No, okay.
[169:43.11]No, no, no.
[169:43.52]Just give that to me.
[169:44.34]Please drop that stupid heal bar.
[169:45.80]Hey, remember we were talking about getting rid of the fucking cats?
[169:48.86]Are they the only thing keeping you alive right now?
[169:51.68]They might be.
[169:54.52]Right in the hands.
[169:55.02]I gotta figure out his, like, attack patterns.
[169:58.87]Yeah, it's definitely his hands.
[170:06.51]Ooh, that was sick.
[170:07.49]I don't know how to do that again.
[170:09.94]But it was pretty amazing, actually.
[170:14.38]I think I want to do Pierce here.
[170:18.08]Pierce is actually really good against this dude.
[170:25.69]Somebody just came in here and put their hands around my neck.
[170:30.13]And started strangling me.
[170:32.19]This is so difficult.
[170:36.20]I can see the bullets bouncing off of him too.
[170:39.80]I knew it was going to happen.
[170:41.19]Also, keep in mind, we're going to be running out of time here.
[170:44.17]Well, we might run out of life before we run out of time.
[170:46.71]Okay, we're good.
[170:54.27]I'm going to, like, go get my weapon fixed.
[170:57.37]No, please, don't do anything to me badly.
[170:59.05]You're right about calling him a hammerhead, though, because that is, like, his primary attack now.
[171:09.24]We're good.
[171:12.86]I got a block instead of dodge.
[171:14.00]Too much like... Oh!
[171:16.27]Bloodborne.
[171:17.39]I couldn't dodge because I had to reload.
[171:19.39]Please, God.
[171:20.61]God, if you do one thing for me this year... One thing, God, just don't let me die right now.
[171:24.89]If you do one thing for me, God in heaven... There we go.
[171:28.81]Don't worry, don't mind me, just like in the sand dune, missing.
[171:42.09]His butthole seems to be a little bit on the weak side too.
[171:44.29]His butthole?
[171:45.43]His weak spot?
[171:46.73]Running.
[171:47.71]He's running.
[171:52.69]Heal up while you have a chance.
[172:01.86]Yeah, his head's not... Oh, he's moving around weirdly.
[172:07.23]He's at me.
[172:07.57]He's looking at me.
[172:08.57]There comes this dumb dodge.
[172:16.39]There it is.
[172:17.65]You on him?
[172:18.47]Yeah.
[172:18.69]Where's the weak spot, though?
[172:21.63]His hands, I think.
[172:22.59]I'm on his neck doing one damage.
[172:25.72]One damage on the back.
[172:28.00]I'm going to do another bomb on him.
[172:32.26]Reload it.
[172:34.24]All the way down the mountain.
[172:36.50]Die!
[172:39.96]Where's he going?
[172:41.38]He's running away.
[172:45.52]Praise the Lord, saved me.
[172:48.19]Why, you have like a moment reprieve to get your stuff together?
[172:54.51]Is this a Christian stream?
[172:56.99]Could be.
[172:57.31]He's just jumping around.
[172:59.95]Alright, right behind him.
[173:04.32]I didn't make it, Daddy.
[173:05.60]I didn't make it.
[173:08.22]I'm not good enough to be on the football team.
[173:11.18]I'm not good enough to be on the football team.
[173:12.82]You're gonna have to put me on the bench.
[173:17.57]He's rolling around in the water mud now, which is odd.
[173:21.26]Oh, he's just mud boy now.
[173:24.04]Holy shit.
[173:24.78]Why is he over here?
[173:26.86]I'm a little tuckered out.
[173:28.72]I don't want to stop.
[173:32.13]Okay, that's not a hiding spot anymore.
[173:37.25]Friendly fire.
[173:37.99]Friendly fire.
[173:38.81]It's alright.
[173:44.79]Hello!
[173:45.23]Hello!
[173:45.69]Alright, it's time for... Oh, please.
[173:51.17]Don't do this to me here.
[173:52.33]There it is.
[173:54.12]I'm almost... I'm gonna get high ground here.
[174:01.68]Let's go for the Pollux.
[174:04.35]Yeah, let's go for the bullets.
[174:05.33]What do you say?
[174:06.65]Oh, please.
[174:08.49]God damn it.
[174:09.67]Why is he?
[174:10.33]Come on.
[174:11.49]Right when I set up too.
[174:12.76]I have to sit there and like set up.
[174:15.44]And he's like, you know what?
[174:16.24]You're like, look at yourself.
[174:17.44]I'm dead.
[174:18.96]Holy shit.
[174:19.38]That was cool.
[174:19.72]That was very close.
[174:21.94]It's almost like he knows that I'm about to do the thing.
[174:23.76]He's like, no, hold on.
[174:24.46]You're going to do that thing where you shoot me a bunch of times.
[174:28.19]I fell in the mud.
[174:30.33]Stuck in the quicksand.
[174:33.09]He's hurt.
[174:34.71]He looks like he's kind of hooked up.
[174:42.31]Oh, you can do that like a lunging attack from the air.
[174:44.17]That's pretty sick.
[174:50.14]Oh, you dick.
[174:57.20]I'm going to blast so hard if we run out of just barely running the time.
[175:03.49]There we go.
[175:08.65]Gotta get a better spot.
[175:09.53]I'm in a bad spot right here.
[175:10.85]Oh, I'm dead.
[175:13.55]No, the quest leader has canceled the flare, returning to base.
[175:19.99]God damn it.
[175:22.47]At least it wasn't me.
[175:24.01]That charge, I have to like, I'm so slow.
[175:26.55]Oh, give me a fucking break.
[175:35.49]Hey, you got one.
[175:36.69]Hey, listen, you got one.
[175:40.60]I got Baroth's Claw.
[175:42.10]Alright, here's what we're going to do.
[175:45.70]We're going to go back to town and we're going to spend all of our stuff on like upgrades.
[175:50.04]At least it wasn't me.
[175:55.50]Yeah.
[175:56.70]Even if you dodge, like he's still going to hit you because you have to like go two miles per hour to use this weapon.
[176:07.51]I'm gonna go upgrade my armor.
[176:08.55]I don't even care.
[176:09.29]That's what I'm gonna do, too.
[176:10.47]He's killing me in one hit.
[176:12.11]Like, that shit can't happen anymore.
[176:13.57]You probably, uh... I don't know if I've upgraded mine, though.
[176:16.74]He was only... He took, like, four hits to kill me.
[176:22.60]And we were rushed.
[176:24.28]That wasn't, like, a good attempt.
[176:25.88]We had, like, 20 more minutes.
[176:26.96]We were, like, running back and... No, no, but, like, you died, and then I died.
[176:31.13]Listen, it's as hard as it's supposed to be.
[176:32.87]Like, this is supposed to happen.
[176:34.05]We're not... You're not supposed to... This is not, like, walk through, hold your hand, you know?
[176:37.65]Monster Hunter.
[176:39.01]You gotta be Monster Hunter on stream to prove your gamer card stand.
[176:42.01]No, that's alright.
[176:42.91]I'm fine.
[176:43.33]That's the first time we've walked.
[176:44.30]That's alright.
[176:46.82]At least it wasn't me.
[176:48.96]Hey, it was you one time.
[176:50.54]It was, yeah.
[176:51.22]I'm just messing with you.
[176:52.42]Just messing with you.
[176:57.23]Let's go upgrade this.
[177:01.21]Actually, no, no, no, no.
[177:02.49]Right here.
[177:03.53]Let's do... Where's the... He's all the way over here.
[177:11.85]Shit!
[177:13.19]No, I'm staying with the gunner.
[177:14.97]It's just something that you have to get used to.
[177:21.46]Let's upgrade my armor, though, because if I take one of those dashes, you just instantly die.
[177:26.30]Let me see what I can do.
[177:36.05]First of all, thank you to Mighty Baseplate for the $81 here.
[177:45.43]That's a lot of money, dude.
[177:46.31]8,100 bits.
[177:50.35]From Mr. Mighty Baseplate, I love you, Jerma.
[177:53.35]Thank you so much, dude.
[177:54.99]Appreciate the $81.
[177:55.95]That's a lot of money.
[178:00.81]Maybe I should get myself a fucking baseplate.
[178:03.57]You know, just for you, I'm going to upgrade my baseplate.
[178:07.81]Chainmail vest.
[178:08.71]Let's get this upgraded.
[178:11.70]Two of your defense, just for you.
[178:14.18]Thank you, man.
[178:15.02]KXZ501, thanks for the $10. $10.
[178:18.45]Baroth is where you put your big boy pants on.
[178:20.60]Good luck.
[178:21.50]Okay.
[178:25.26]Haha, love you.
[178:30.39]Thank you, KXE501.
[178:32.37]Appreciate it.
[178:36.27]Use the bagpipe.
[178:38.19]That would be really, really bad.
[178:42.10]Alright, so... Armosphere...
[178:45.69]So this is defense level 2.
[178:47.53]I can do it a couple times.
[178:48.63]I wonder if it's even worth doing it.
[178:52.41]Maybe do it... It's a 1.
[178:54.75]Maybe I'll just do it twice.
[178:56.09]I wonder if that's a terrible idea.
[179:01.27]Let's actually forge instead.
[179:02.53]Let's see.
[179:05.27]Chainmail Hunter's Bone.
[179:08.57]Pukey.
[179:11.05]I can make a pukey mill.
[179:14.08]Hmm.
[179:15.74]Stamina Surge is a skill item prolonger.
[179:18.12]Let me take a look at that.
[179:20.70]Extends the duration of some item effects.
[179:23.46]Interesting.
[179:28.97]Okay.
[179:31.23]Should I try to do the Pyuki set?
[179:34.01]Item effects last 10% longer.
[179:35.37]What about the Kulu?
[179:38.66]This is Stamina Surge.
[179:40.74]Speeds up Stamina Recovery.
[179:41.86]That's pretty great.
[179:46.07]I could do the gloves here.
[179:47.77]Affinity sliding.
[179:48.89]Increases affinity by 30% for a short time with the sliding.
[180:00.34]10, 12.
[180:00.70]What's the heavy?
[180:02.30]What's heavier?
[180:02.82]6, 12.
[180:03.08]I think I'll do pukey.
[180:08.67]Mr. Pukey.
[180:09.71]Sounds good to me.
[180:15.93]Let's give that a whirl.
[180:16.99]Let's get Etalyx back here.
[180:18.21]I don't know if you can hear me or not.
[180:19.19]No, you can't.
[180:25.99]Okay.
[180:28.79]From what I've heard, mixing and matching armor is somewhat more viable in this game.
[180:32.66]Okay.
[180:33.68]So it's worth potentially doing.
[180:35.34]Alright, let's do... Let's do pukey male.
[180:42.90]Okay.
[180:50.59]I can't upgrade my weapon anymore, so that's going to have to stay the way it is.
[180:56.77]Affinity is crit chance.
[180:59.46]Put that on.
[181:01.92]I cannot do anything else with the pukey, but I can do this, and now I get prolonged items.
[181:09.59]Get a different headpiece.
[181:15.59]I think we're going to get these.
[181:16.77]12 defense.
[181:18.29]That's pretty good.
[181:19.25]I think casted on guards.
[181:21.09]Let's make these.
[181:24.60]Is my internet dying?
[181:33.46]What's going on here?
[181:37.61]Cool.
[181:39.43]Now I can make...
[181:44.68]I can make this head.
[181:45.52]Is it fire resistance?
[181:49.92]What about legs?
[181:51.68]Bone coil.
[181:53.24]Bone graves.
[181:54.96]Um... I mean, this is... I'll get the head.
[182:09.17]I'm gonna look really strange.
[182:21.17]Yeah, I'm turning into one of those level 30 World of Warcraft characters.
[182:24.55]And we'll go with Bone Kilt and Bone Greaves.
[182:29.53]Alright, what are you doing?
[182:32.10]I'm making new armor.
[182:33.28]I'm mixing and matching a ton of different messed up armor.
[182:36.91]You should craft brand new armor.
[182:38.73]That's what I'm doing.
[182:39.97]Oh, okay.
[182:40.35]That's what I'm doing.
[182:41.57]And then are you upgrading that armor?
[182:42.65]Which one are you doing?
[182:44.13]Hunter?
[182:44.49]I am just... Oh, we can make a bunch.
[182:45.79]I'm just doing... That's why you say mix and match.
[182:47.39]Yeah, I look really, really strange.
[182:53.36]Apparently there are 94 sets of armor.
[182:57.72]That's just a random number I pulled out from someone named Poopy Dick Lance.
[183:00.86]I don't know how much...
[183:04.76]I don't know how much credence I give that number.
[183:08.34]Yeah.
[183:08.82]If you're looking for knowledge of this game, make sure you check out PoopyDickland.
[183:13.29]Yeah.
[183:14.29]Seems like he knows what he's talking about, probably.
[183:15.91]Alright.
[183:17.51]So I've got my stuff on.
[183:19.37]Now let's upgrade.
[183:24.37]Too good.
[183:25.31]Can I not upgrade this death?
[183:28.97]Oh, no.
[183:29.23]Yeah, I can.
[183:29.63]Right?
[183:30.57]Yes.
[183:31.67]So should I upgrade this?
[183:33.75]You shouldn't give it much.
[183:38.87]Now, is there a poopy dickhead in my chat that can tell me if this is a bad idea?
[183:43.67]What do you think?
[183:49.61]One of these Mr. Poopy Rick and Morty Mr. Butthole, right?
[183:59.74]Puke armor.
[184:02.88]Like, what if I just do this to, like, level 2 or 3?
[184:06.46]This is a bad idea.
[184:10.40]Don't do it.
[184:10.88]It's a bad idea.
[184:12.55]Very bad idea.
[184:13.27]Wow.
[184:16.49]Save it for later.
[184:17.37]It's a bad idea.
[184:18.03]Okay.
[184:19.59]Alright, I can't do anything else, I don't think.
[184:22.13]Nothing with the gun, right?
[184:27.73]What about this?
[184:31.33]Bone tree.
[184:34.41]I mean, I can't... I'm going to stick with it.
[184:42.93]Stop being bad.
[184:44.86]What did I do?
[184:45.66]That was a funny Rick and Morty reference.
[184:51.86]I know.
[184:53.16]I'm full of those.
[184:54.16]Let's take a look.
[184:59.64]Maybe I want to take off the reload assist.
[185:05.78]Recoil suppressor.
[185:06.82]That actually feels like it's important with a big slow gun.
[185:17.83]Alright.
[185:19.41]I'm ready.
[185:19.73]I need to start a fresh tree.
[185:30.24]Start with a fresh thing and make it a bone gun.
[185:39.09]Give the cat armor.
[185:42.17]Who cares about that dumb cat?
[185:47.61]Purchase weapons.
[185:48.83]Let's see.
[185:49.85]So... So you're telling me... If I use the... If I buy another heavy bow gun, I can turn it into a bone weapon, right?
[185:59.52]Yeah.
[186:05.18]Is this like stupid?
[186:06.48]Wait, do I?
[186:07.20]Because I turned the other one into this.
[186:08.84]So if I buy this one, I can turn it into a bone, right?
[186:12.16]Just do that a couple times and maybe try that.
[186:13.58]Just want to be sure I have this correct.
[186:26.97]How much are these?
[186:32.05]Cat armor, cat armor, cat armor.
[186:40.00]We aren't telling you until you pet the Poogie.
[186:43.30]I already did that.
[186:46.14]Okay, I'm going to assume that's what you have to do.
[186:57.09]Cat armor or riot.
[187:01.87]Okay, bone shooter.
[187:03.03]Here we go.
[187:07.19]Let's try the bone shooter.
[187:15.86]Let's put it on and let's go upgrade it.
[187:22.39]I have the bone shooter on.
[187:25.63]Pet the blacksmith.
[187:32.81]Pet the blacksmith.
[187:36.37]You can't.
[187:39.36]Alright, so bone shooter 2 is 165
[187:48.03]What was the... Which one do I have?
[187:49.35]This one?
[187:50.11]This one's Jagras Assault 1.
[187:51.65]180.
[187:51.67]So this is less damage.
[187:57.65]Let's do it.
[188:01.45]Alright.
[188:02.14]There's my Bone Shooter 2.
[188:04.06]Bone Shooter 3.
[188:06.60]Blooming Shooter.
[188:09.38]This is then next down the tree.
[188:14.44]So I need two more... One more Monster Bone and one Ancient Bone.
[188:20.36]This one, I just need another... I need three more Pukey Pukey skills.
[188:26.06]I'll try it up.
[188:29.70]It's currently equipped.
[188:30.72]Now I need to put a modification in it.
[188:36.60]Let's put a close range up.
[188:40.64]Ranged attack up.
[188:41.36]Which one?
[188:41.66]I prefer the Bone Shooter.
[188:42.60]I'm assuming that... Wyvern Snipe is the special ammo, I'm going to assume.
[188:51.06]That's what I want, is ranged attack up.
[188:57.10]Okay, let's go take a look and see what I can use for ammo.
[189:05.63]I need to go to the item box.
[189:12.91]Manage items.
[189:17.11]Where did Etalyx go?
[189:21.67]Okay, so we have normal armor 2.
[189:26.82]Just as standard.
[189:27.76]Piercing armor 1.
[189:29.26]No piercing armor 2.
[189:30.48]No poison ammo.
[189:31.80]No power coating.
[189:33.32]How we doing?
[189:33.70]I'm good.
[189:34.92]I just upgraded everything.
[189:37.19]Slicing ammo 1.
[189:38.13]I think all you need to do, make sure you put everything into your chest, right?
[189:44.11]Mm-hmm.
[189:46.61]Like, you want to put every single thing...
[189:52.47]Sticky ammo.
[189:55.37]How do you store all?
[189:57.63]Cluster bomb.
[189:58.23]This thing is... So you can do better... Okay, I understand.
[190:01.07]So this one... You can use more ammo, but it does less damage.
[190:09.70]I think I understand.
[190:11.58]Spread ammo 2.
[190:12.26]There we go.
[190:14.44]Fill it.
[190:17.54]Okay.
[190:18.48]Slicing ammo.
[190:19.20]That's what we wanted.
[190:23.83]I don't have any more recovery, but I do have this.
[190:26.53]How am I going to do poison ammo 2?
[190:30.25]Wyvern ammo.
[190:33.59]That's the max.
[190:39.16]Let's put piercing ammo 1 here, max.
[190:43.06]Okie dokie.
[190:46.52]I am ready to try to fight this monster again, Taliesin.
[190:50.72]Did you store everything except what you need in your box so that you can actually get resources?
[191:01.05]I don't know how to do it automatically, so I've had to do it manually.
[191:05.01]I'm just gonna do it.
[191:07.61]What?
[191:07.73]I'm just gonna throw it in.
[191:12.56]I'm gonna put it in my Minecraft box.
[191:17.08]Maybe I was supposed to click X.
[191:19.39]How many potions do I have?
[191:20.53]30.
[191:22.33]I want to be prepared for this one.
[191:27.77]I wish Circle didn't delete you from this whole menu.
[191:32.45]Okay.
[191:33.53]We probably should craft some stuff too, honestly.
[191:37.90]If we want to be really serious.
[191:39.54]Like a buff of some kind, you know?
[191:43.74]Well, I was going to just eat food.
[191:47.92]Like nutrients, for example, can increase your maximum health.
[191:50.98]Put the honey back.
[191:54.55]Rations.
[191:56.11]Seems good.
[191:59.63]Stock up on antidotes for fun.
[192:02.96]Only had one honey, though, unfortunately.
[192:04.54]So if you have honey, make some nutrients and mega nutrients.
[192:07.50]Take your vitamins, honey.
[192:08.87]There's so much to do in this game.
[192:11.83]Mega potion.
[192:13.49]Let's go ahead and make a few of these.
[192:15.55]Life powder.
[192:16.29]Produce a healing cloud in the area around the usable AOE heal potions.
[192:21.48]Nutrients.
[192:24.56]This is actually kind of cool.
[192:25.44]I'm going to bring these.
[192:28.00]Yeah, it is cool.
[192:29.54]Let's make some more potions.
[192:32.42]Oh, you can sort by... The life powder...
[192:39.35]Provides a healing cloud with a dog bug.
[192:42.75]Yeah.
[192:44.23]I think that's going a little too far down the path for me at the moment.
[192:49.48]I'm going to try some life powder.
[192:54.92]There, I got one life powder.
[192:58.14]Alright.
[192:59.26]I think I'm ready to move.
[193:01.16]Make sure, if you know you crafted them, it may have crafted into your box, so make sure you bring... That's making sure they're inside.
[193:08.91]Nutrients.
[193:12.29]There's no poison here, right?
[193:13.59]It's just the scary guy.
[193:14.91]That guy, I don't think he was poison.
[193:17.11]Could be wrong.
[193:18.23]Okay.
[193:20.58]Rations.
[193:22.90]Okay, now I need regular...
[193:27.26]We've got to gear up, man.
[193:28.12]This is Monster Hunter, not like stumble upon the monster and kill him first try.
[193:32.09]You know what I mean?
[193:33.31]This is not stumble upon monster, kill the monster with the first try, guys.
[193:36.85]Yeah.
[193:37.51]This is Monster Hunter.
[193:41.06]Difficult.
[193:42.02]Scary.
[193:43.06]Fucked up.
[193:43.46]Alright.
[193:46.76]That should be it for me.
[193:48.31]I've got eight mega potions, ten potions, five nutrients, ten rations, and... what?
[193:53.97]You might have more than me.
[193:55.17]How many mega potions are you bringing?
[193:57.15]Eight.
[193:58.37]Eight?
[193:58.87]Okay, I'm bringing three.
[194:00.87]Hopefully that's good enough.
[194:02.69]With our new armor, we should be good, you know?
[194:04.84]New armor, new guns.
[194:06.04]By the way, I figured out why I'm not dying.
[194:07.42]If you need to be healed, like, scream at me.
[194:10.02]Because, like, I have healing ammo.
[194:12.72]Alright.
[194:13.58]I'm usually okay because apparently just using a melee weapon, I have more health than you.
[194:20.09]I have physical resist.
[194:21.35]You have elemental resist.
[194:23.05]Are you, like, level 30 World of Warcraft character ready to go play?
[194:26.89]Yes, I am.
[194:27.45]Alright, guys.
[194:28.47]We're ready to play the game.
[194:31.06]It's only been about 35 minutes.
[194:34.22]Uh, that's not true.
[194:35.28]I know.
[194:36.98]But we did play the game fast, and look what happened, you know?
[194:39.40]Alright, so I'm at the board right now.
[194:40.82]We don't have to be up on the... Wait, I want to eat, too.
[194:43.98]We can eat at the camp.
[194:44.98]Oh, okay.
[194:46.34]So let's just... Do you want to start it?
[194:49.06]Yeah, I have already started it.
[194:50.78]You are welcome to join.
[194:53.14]Okay, join a quest.
[194:55.87]Available quest assigned.
[194:58.13]There it is.
[195:00.13]Yes.
[195:06.49]Stand by for departure.
[195:09.63]Oh, this time I have clothes on.
[195:14.10]I have a terrible Ninja Turtles costume on, but it's going to be enough.
[195:18.20]My costume actually doesn't look bad.
[195:20.26]I'm pretty put together.
[195:21.08]I look awful.
[195:23.65]I got dressed with the light on this morning.
[195:26.44]I didn't.
[195:27.24]I was bumping around late to work and clothes fell on me.
[195:33.80]You had the dream of going to school naked and you forgot your pants.
[195:38.73]Here we go.
[195:41.71]alright let's do it still no cat armor oh yeah I forgot about that we're supposed to like craft stuff for the cats too cool cat armor there's too much stuff there's too many things to do like like you have to I'm of the opinion you have to play a Monster Hunter game for like 10 hours before we've already been playing for like five or six total before you actually like understand what's really going on
[196:11.15]Alright, let me see you, and you see me.
[196:12.89]Okay.
[196:15.25]Yeah, you look kind of cool.
[196:16.80]I look like somebody found me in a dumpster somewhere.
[196:19.88]You actually do look like a ninja turtle top.
[196:22.64]Yeah, I told you.
[196:25.32]Nice, like, bandana.
[196:26.56]Are you going to tell my fortune?
[196:28.58]Maybe, if you're lucky.
[196:30.14]Do you want to read my palm?
[196:31.50]Do you want to hold my hand?
[196:32.58]Are you taking potions here?
[196:35.49]I mean, I brought with me...
[196:37.24]I did too.
[196:37.92]I brought a lot.
[196:38.84]I'm going to bring like... I guess I'll take a little bit of each one.
[196:41.48]I'll take a couple of extras.
[196:44.32]So I think I have a different... Just come over here and cook.
[196:46.74]I'm pretty sure I have a different special move now.
[196:49.42]Do you?
[196:49.92]Yeah.
[196:50.30]It's like a snipe.
[196:51.06]Do you have bone weapon too?
[196:53.66]Yeah, I have bone weapon.
[196:54.46]I have no idea how this works.
[196:56.62]I think I'm going to just use it.
[196:57.82]Just to try it.
[196:58.34]Because I don't want to make a fool out of myself in the middle of the stream.
[197:01.52]This is gonna use what's gonna happen here when I do this alright.
[197:05.10]I need to I need to practice this guy This is just because I don't here we go What does this do oh?
[197:13.59]I lie on the ground But they're really effective against this guy is there a scope I?
[197:21.69]Don't know I don't think I can zoom in and be the target.
[197:23.99]I'll be the target.
[197:25.37]I don't think this is zoom in oh
[197:29.95]No, I don't think this is human.
[197:31.65]No, I don't want to shoot it.
[197:33.33]How many bullets do you have for it?
[197:36.08]One orange bar.
[197:38.28]Whatever that means.
[197:40.34]Somebody in my chat called you a dollar store action figure.
[197:45.70]This is no scope.
[197:47.22]You're not wearing any pants.
[197:48.80]Yes, I am.
[197:49.84]You just have bones, but I can see your bare, hairless legs.
[197:54.57]Let's go to the camp and make food.
[197:58.51]Why are you in the tent?
[197:59.35]That's not where you make food.
[198:00.51]But that is where you make something else.
[198:02.99]That's where you make... You get the cat his armor.
[198:07.18]Come on.
[198:07.60]Let's... Hey, look at that.
[198:09.26]You guys didn't think I was going to have a funny Wildstar character.
[198:13.56]Look at this.
[198:16.02]I keep bringing Wildstar into this.
[198:17.50]Look at this.
[198:18.88]I have like an actually... Is there like... What is pay with points?
[198:23.70]I don't know.
[198:26.87]But, like, where do you get the points from?
[198:28.31]Are there chests to open?
[198:30.92]Maybe.
[198:31.78]Microtransactions?
[198:33.48]Or you need defense up this time.
[198:34.26]Do I have to share this?
[198:36.30]You should probably get, like, defense up this time.
[198:38.26]What do you cook?
[198:40.84]You just sit down at one of these tables.
[198:42.40]At one of the chairs.
[198:44.04]Alright, pay with money.
[198:45.12]I'm going with defense this time.
[198:48.23]Defense up.
[198:48.97]This is health and stamina.
[198:52.85]Yeah.
[198:54.67]I want some defense.
[198:56.84]I think I got defense too, but I probably should have got attack.
[199:01.88]I do want to arm wrestle.
[199:04.41]That looks really good.
[199:07.61]I wish I could eat that right now.
[199:12.33]I would be eating it as fast as he is too.
[199:17.90]Alright.
[199:19.02]Are you ready?
[199:20.60]I'm ready.
[199:21.90]I am ready.
[199:22.44]That food looks delicious.
[199:26.24]Let's go.
[199:29.71]I feel a lot stronger than last time, you know?
[199:32.35]So if you got a new special, how do I know if I got a new special?
[199:37.73]So why is this not selecting?
[199:40.61]If I go to normal MO2, why is it not selecting it?
[199:43.27]Do I have to press down?
[199:49.35]Oh god, you just have to keep it still.
[199:51.87]Okay, I get it.
[199:53.23]That's easier.
[199:57.03]Okay.
[199:58.12]Understandable.
[199:58.74]Let's go.
[199:59.12]Let's track the monster.
[200:01.50]I don't think I got a new move.
[200:02.72]So yours is cooler than mine, confirmed.
[200:04.68]We don't know if mine's cooler.
[200:07.06]I haven't used it yet.
[200:07.81]You know I'm going to completely best this guy with this shot and everyone's going to laugh at me, right?
[200:12.41]Well, you just have to hope that you can reload.
[200:15.90]Oh, that's not him.
[200:17.06]Well, I need these.
[200:17.76]Do we have to hunt him again?
[200:18.86]I need to collect these fire herbs to make ammo.
[200:22.40]Yes, we have to hunt him again because we failed so miserably last time.
[200:25.77]There's a sleep herb.
[200:26.75]I wonder if we could, like... Ooh, we can craft tranquilizers.
[200:30.57]I wonder if you could, like, shoot a tranq at him.
[200:32.83]Yeah, I think there is tranq shot.
[200:33.89]But then I bet if we hit him, then we wake him up.
[200:36.46]Probably.
[200:37.36]That's probably how you, like, capture them.
[200:38.94]Alright, is he on the map or no?
[200:40.56]Do we have to actually tranq him?
[200:41.78]Alright.
[200:43.62]Let's begin the hunt.
[200:46.99]Hunt a Baroth.
[200:50.07]Let's just head down this way.
[200:51.11]Follow your nose.
[200:55.45]Get some needle bevvies.
[200:58.74]Flames nuts.
[200:59.76]You can now make gunpowder, thank God.
[201:03.04]How many times can you dig at one cactus?
[201:08.80]Feels bad, man.
[201:09.78]Read chat.
[201:13.73]pre-recorded alright so I'm reading chat right now and I see the I see save nine times and I see bowies like three times I'm looking for something specific here I found him alright I'm gonna snipe him there he is want me to snipe him wait you already found him he's right here come to me I am heading to you right now I'm gonna go for a snipe
[201:44.74]He's sleeping.
[201:46.46]He's currently sleeping.
[201:47.10]I'm gonna shoot him right in his ball sack.
[201:52.08]Which way are you facing?
[201:55.64]What are you talking about?
[201:59.06]I don't know what happened there.
[201:59.92]Maybe I'm out of range.
[202:02.30]He's right in front of us.
[202:03.04]Okay.
[202:05.92]Where?
[202:06.20]Right ahead.
[202:10.24]The guy walking between the two rocks?
[202:14.08]Like on the other side of the map?
[202:15.56]Yeah, he's right here.
[202:16.42]He's straight ahead.
[202:20.78]Shot the ground.
[202:22.44]I don't know how, but I did.
[202:26.38]Sniping with a shotgun.
[202:27.34]Did you already shoot at him and miss?
[202:29.50]I think I was sniping.
[202:30.38]Let me gather some footprint data.
[202:34.25]Somewhere.
[202:36.29]You need data.
[202:36.89]Who needs data when we got a, you know, we got a, he's right sleeping over there.
[202:40.15]Hide.
[202:42.61]Oh.
[202:45.84]Okay.
[202:46.28]I think he sees you.
[202:49.83]Does he, though?
[202:51.71]He looks like he's... No, I guess not.
[202:54.31]Does he, though?
[202:55.35]I don't think he's... I think they're, like, not aggressive.
[202:57.66]We're the bad guys.
[202:59.08]That's how the game's gonna end.
[203:00.46]Alright, so...
[203:05.48]How do you want to go about doing this?
[203:06.38]How do you want to do this?
[203:07.32]I don't know.
[203:07.62]No, you.
[203:08.62]Well, I mean... I'll go in, and you go in, and then we both just kill him.
[203:12.92]Okay, don't fight him in the water here, though, because you would have to wade through it.
[203:16.42]I'm going to be up here.
[203:17.84]I'm going to sit up here in my sniper roost.
[203:20.61]Okay, and you want me... So I got to do the heavy lifting.
[203:23.13]No, I mean, I'm going to eventually have to move.
[203:24.69]We're going to fight him in the cave.
[203:25.77]Do you want me to, like, lure... I can lure him out.
[203:28.95]No, this is a bad place to fight him.
[203:31.05]I poked him in the butt.
[203:32.17]Oh, you pulled him?
[203:33.60]No, he doesn't know what's going on yet.
[203:36.27]There he comes.
[203:36.77]He's angry because he just felt a slingshot on his bump.
[203:41.63]Okay, I'm aiming.
[203:44.53]I'm currently... My vision is obstructed.
[203:47.67]I'm trying to pull him out.
[203:48.63]Pull him out.
[203:49.07]Let's see if I can get him right in his side.
[203:52.17]You know, I wish the cat would get out of the fucking way.
[203:55.41]I'm out of range of those things.
[203:56.97]Now I'm in range of those.
[203:57.99]Here he comes.
[203:58.45]Alright, let's give it a try.
[204:01.59]I hit him, I guess.
[204:02.72]You did.
[204:04.14]There was a small fiery burst.
[204:07.02]Okay.
[204:07.72]Now he's angry with me.
[204:09.54]It's alright.
[204:11.40]He cannot come over here.
[204:14.34]Are you sure about that?
[204:15.06]Because he's making a beeline directly for you.
[204:17.58]Yes, he is.
[204:18.00]But he had to go ring around the Rosie.
[204:22.71]He's still after me.
[204:25.18]Here we go again.
[204:25.94]Take two.
[204:27.52]Slicing ammo, does it do anything to him?
[204:29.36]Actually, it is pretty good.
[204:30.23]I have to get it on his hand, though.
[204:31.61]I didn't even do any... I think you did that, not me.
[204:34.33]If I get that on his hand... Accuracy, holy shit, dude.
[204:39.95]That didn't even hurt.
[204:40.99]Ow.
[204:46.87]Wowie!
[204:48.70]Struggling right now to even get close.
[204:50.16]I gotta be careful.
[204:54.76]Alright, not the legs.
[204:56.68]The hand.
[204:58.60]You just dove into the mud.
[205:00.94]No, I didn't.
[205:02.26]No, I did.
[205:03.34]My character.
[205:04.54]I thought you were like, you just dove into the mud.
[205:06.24]No.
[205:06.58]My character, like, for no reason, just dove straight into the mud.
[205:12.51]I don't want to fight him in there.
[205:19.05]What does this do with this ammo?
[205:20.51]I think it's like, this is the supercharge, I think.
[205:22.01]I'm going to put this away for now.
[205:26.63]Not this again.
[205:27.27]Alright, that did almost a hundred damage.
[205:37.23]I haven't done anything yet.
[205:38.76]He's like in such an awkward spot all the time.
[205:42.16]Do that again.
[205:42.72]I'll do that like five more times, man.
[205:45.78]You okay?
[205:46.06]He says he can't move.
[205:49.82]I'm in some glitchy mud right now.
[205:53.13]Can we fight him, like, not on top of the Grand Canyon?
[205:56.67]I want to get him in a... I need to get that high ground again.
[206:01.99]Put this away.
[206:02.47]I need to stop holding the gun out the whole time, and I need a guy to actually come around.
[206:12.97]Just out of range.
[206:13.75]Shit.
[206:14.76]That was a waste, unfortunately.
[206:16.96]Now he... My god, that sucks.
[206:19.32]I can't find his, like, weak spots.
[206:20.88]Oh, that sucks such asshole.
[206:23.84]That four and a half second reload is going to make me throw up.
[206:27.72]Alright, I don't want to die.
[206:28.68]I'm about to die.
[206:29.64]Careful.
[206:29.96]Where's he going?
[206:37.60]The cats have flotation devices.
[206:39.18]Wait, are you good?
[206:40.16]I got you.
[206:41.04]I am good.
[206:42.28]I'm about to super get you.
[206:47.14]Nice.
[206:48.20]He's gone.
[206:48.68]He ran away.
[206:50.39]You did pretty much all the work there.
[206:52.54]Because I cannot land any hits.
[206:56.60]That wyvern shot is really good, but it takes a long time to happen, and you have to stand still.
[207:00.49]Are these guys aggressive?
[207:04.19]They do seem to be aggressive, yes.
[207:05.87]Are they?
[207:07.47]I'm going to top myself off, and I'm going to eat a ration.
[207:11.59]Okay.
[207:12.76]And I'm going to also eat one of these.
[207:18.52]Eat a nutrient if you haven't.
[207:20.40]Oh, yeah.
[207:21.18]I did bring at least one.
[207:24.72]He's down here.
[207:25.38]I don't know where it is, though.
[207:26.70]Alright, he's just chilling down there.
[207:30.26]I want to just, like, fucking snipe him.
[207:36.05]Can he jump up here?
[207:37.09]There's a ration.
[207:37.85]How do you eat your, um... He can jump up here.
[207:40.35]Of course he can.
[207:41.47]Okay, well, I'll eat that in a second.
[207:45.90]Let's see if I can get in a good spot.
[207:48.92]Out of range, out of range, out of range.
[207:51.19]Really?
[207:51.53]I have to get right at his face for this shit.
[207:56.51]That's not out of range.
[207:57.99]No, it's not.
[207:58.47]Thank God.
[208:01.43]Quickly, quickly, quickly, quickly.
[208:04.13]Let's see if I can get that again.
[208:05.11]Kidding me.
[208:06.75]I'm not gonna run.
[208:18.92]That, like, messes with me, by the way.
[208:20.66]It does?
[208:21.52]Yes.
[208:21.80]Whenever you do the big explosive shot, it knocks me down.
[208:24.45]Oh.
[208:24.93]Okay.
[208:25.17]Well, maybe I should say, get out of the way!
[208:30.69]It's doing 110 damage.
[208:32.57]I can't, like, fight him over there.
[208:34.68]I only have one more shot at this, so it's not going to be an issue anymore after I hit you one more.
[208:43.51]I'm going to do it right now.
[208:53.41]Ow.
[208:53.75]I'm out of those, so you don't have to worry about that happening anymore.
[209:00.35]I want to do my special move.
[209:02.71]Alright, how about this?
[209:03.77]You fight him.
[209:05.11]I can't.
[209:05.61]He only wants you.
[209:06.45]He's only got eyes for you.
[209:07.77]I'm going to heal you is what I'm saying.
[209:08.91]I'm just going to focus on healing you.
[209:14.43]I think I blocked that.
[209:16.05]And mud.
[209:17.49]I hate this guy because of the mud.
[209:19.81]It's miserable.
[209:21.41]Yeah, it sucks.
[209:22.73]Because it puts my weapon up.
[209:25.30]Oh, he's coming for me.
[209:33.68]Alright.
[209:34.02]That radio thing is really actually kind of annoying to use.
[209:37.36]What's he doing?
[209:38.00]I think he's running away.
[209:39.10]Where's he going?
[209:40.50]He's running away, I think.
[209:42.53]Yes, he is.
[209:44.76]Did we even do any damage to him that time?
[209:46.94]Yeah, I did like 300, 400 damage.
[209:52.40]His parts are broken, apparently.
[209:54.08]Something broke on him.
[209:56.18]Whatever that means.
[210:00.54]He actually seems like he's in a pretty bad spot.
[210:02.24]Let me try to snipe him again.
[210:04.71]He's kind of just sitting there.
[210:06.71]Am I going to be out of range?
[210:12.09]Oh!
[210:13.11]Oh!
[210:16.86]I can't turn.
[210:18.84]Please.
[210:19.80]What if I don't move?
[210:22.01]No, I can't turn around.
[210:22.99]God damn it.
[210:32.98]Alright, that works.
[210:35.58]Come on.
[210:39.94]You let me know if you need healing.
[210:46.51]I'm gonna take the normal ammo off.
[210:47.73]Yes, I know I can't.
[210:48.60]Shoot him.
[210:48.96]I need healing.
[210:53.44]Thank you.
[210:53.86]I didn't even do that.
[210:55.76]I don't know if it was you, but it was the cat.
[210:57.74]It took me like a full 10 seconds to switch and reload it.
[211:00.70]Alright, you can get in there.
[211:02.91]I got you in my sights.
[211:08.89]I'm just gonna hang out next to you.
[211:12.53]He won't fight me at all.
[211:17.63]okay stay in there yeah I'm just gonna just keep I'm gonna just keep that up just stay in there alright that's just me being bad right there careful he's coming back gun lance is like hard on this guy no a gun lance is probably hard in general
[211:45.75]oh you're out of range here okay that didn't hit you a little bit stunned right now apparently how did that not hit you I'm coming for you I just healed alright I was holding block that's pretty amazing that you can do that actually yeah I can only do it twice though it's a really long reload
[212:17.81]What about your friend?
[212:19.25]Where's Talon?
[212:20.29]Yeah, I don't know.
[212:21.89]He'll be fine.
[212:23.07]Okay, apparently that missed.
[212:24.49]Somehow.
[212:24.97]In a magical fucking world.
[212:30.79]Careful.
[212:32.15]I'm going for grenades.
[212:38.70]Yeah!
[212:39.08]That was like a carpet bomb.
[212:42.34]It really was.
[212:47.78]Hey, thanks for the heals.
[212:50.28]I really love to, like, fight this guy.
[212:53.28]Alright, I only got one more shot on that, so... I have to save that.
[213:02.73]Reload this.
[213:03.61]No, I don't have to reload it.
[213:04.65]Go ahead.
[213:05.95]What is he doing?
[213:06.45]I'm doing this kind of thing.
[213:17.71]Explosion.
[213:18.69]You exploded me out of the mud, which is pretty funny.
[213:21.27]Explosion.
[213:29.37]Where you going, buddy?
[213:31.89]I don't know where he's going.
[213:34.13]He's still here.
[213:38.21]I'm coming.
[213:38.71]Hey, look, I finally did something.
[213:43.77]Snipe it.
[213:48.59]I'm, like, cowering right now.
[213:50.05]He's so scary.
[213:51.37]He has to be, you know.
[213:54.51]Alright, I gotta shine my blade.
[213:55.83]I gotta put some spit shine on it.
[213:58.22]Easy.
[213:58.52]Do it again.
[214:00.42]Uh, there's some helpers, apparently?
[214:03.40]We got some flyers up in the sky.
[214:05.10]Apparently yellow is as good as it gets now.
[214:09.62]Cut off its tail with the slice ammo.
[214:11.54]Actually, good idea.
[214:12.28]Let me try that.
[214:17.66]Bone gun way, way better than the jargon.
[214:23.19]Is it?
[214:23.37]Oh, way better.
[214:24.47]How so?
[214:25.83]I fucking didn't jump.
[214:27.07]Dummy.
[214:28.25]The ammo is just much better to use.
[214:29.69]There's much better ammo than the other one.
[214:39.48]What is he... Oh, we got through this phase last time.
[214:41.86]Yeah.
[214:43.74]Okay, where's the...
[214:48.74]I'm gonna try to cut his tail off.
[214:50.86]Okay, good luck with that.
[214:51.78]Alright, I got one of his tail.
[214:55.60]Two on the tail.
[214:56.50]I wonder if we can just pop it off.
[215:00.50]I wonder, does it have to be in a certain exact position?
[215:02.58]Did I block that?
[215:03.32]I don't know.
[215:09.58]Nah, I gotta get a better position.
[215:13.50]I guess we have one more in there that's like Murray's butt.
[215:17.43]Get me out.
[215:24.52]Yeah, we fought him here last time.
[215:26.14]This is the bane of our existence.
[215:27.92]Or my existence.
[215:30.72]Why would I reload?
[215:31.62]He just knows.
[215:32.26]Ow.
[215:39.21]He just knows when I reload.
[215:43.95]It's not fair.
[215:50.30]Far away.
[215:53.62]Um... This tail just moves around so damn much.
[215:58.43]Got it.
[215:59.37]Cut it off.
[216:06.41]Cut that tail off.
[216:09.15]Oh, you idiot.
[216:13.00]This is not a good time to be backed up against here.
[216:15.52]Not a good time.
[216:25.96]Alright.
[216:26.22]How are you doing?
[216:30.58]Concentrate.
[216:31.38]Also talking check, but I'm doing a little bit more now.
[216:35.33]Just waiting for that opportunity.
[216:36.53]Got it.
[216:38.57]Oh, you stunned me twice.
[216:40.29]You stunned me twice.
[216:41.51]What?
[216:42.27]I don't know.
[216:42.61]I'm getting like, I don't know if it was him roaring or your shots.
[216:45.33]I'm shooting.
[216:45.89]I'm just shooting like standard ammo.
[216:47.47]It was like interrupting my combo.
[216:48.80]I think it was screaming at you.
[216:50.00]Yeah.
[216:54.07]Alright, hopefully I can cut that tail off.
[216:58.00]I hope so.
[217:00.60]I'm trying.
[217:01.88]I wish I could jump on top of him again, but it didn't seem to do anything last time.
[217:11.23]Let's try a little of this, Zach.
[217:12.25]Lead him over here.
[217:14.89]Easier said than done.
[217:18.23]Come on, right at the tail.
[217:19.56]Cut it off!
[217:20.18]I need a... I need a shark.
[217:23.04]Oh, god damn it.
[217:23.58]I shot a fucking, like, fish in the head.
[217:27.86]Oh, give me a break.
[217:35.39]I only have one shot left here.
[217:38.33]Come on, is that for the money?
[217:39.35]Make it count.
[217:39.91]No, I didn't make it count.
[217:40.57]I missed.
[217:42.19]No tail for us.
[217:42.99]Look, strong button.
[217:52.71]Alright, so shields are actually amazing if you just only shield.
[217:56.89]Get out of the way, Pat.
[217:57.56]Get out of the way.
[217:59.66]Are these cats on rafts?
[218:01.80]They are on rafts, yes.
[218:10.02]It's really hard to fight in this, like, pool of liquid.
[218:13.45]I need to read this.
[218:14.55]My inventory is a fucking joke.
[218:18.01]Also, there's a couple of fish dinosaurs.
[218:20.89]There are a couple.
[218:23.33]I'm not really sure how to handle him.
[218:26.21]Alright, this looks like a better place to fight.
[218:31.42]Can I blow the tail off?
[218:39.32]I shouldn't have brought the spread ammo.
[218:41.32]I should have only brought the slice ammo.
[218:42.74]I could have cut his balls off.
[218:44.55]There we go.
[218:45.55]I did a thing.
[218:49.61]I need to sharpen my blade, though.
[218:52.58]In the middle of combat.
[218:53.50]Alright, we're back.
[218:57.46]He's limping.
[218:57.96]Yeah, he's limping.
[218:58.59]We got it.
[218:59.01]We got it this time.
[219:00.47]He's gonna die.
[219:01.45]He's gonna go back to his little cave.
[219:03.83]Mm-hmm.
[219:05.77]Where maybe it was just right here.
[219:07.43]I don't even have ammo right now.
[219:11.26]Spread ammo.
[219:12.48]Useless.
[219:13.60]Pierce ammo.
[219:14.22]Let me try that.
[219:19.04]He's gonna go...
[219:21.87]Oh no, he tunneled under the mud.
[219:31.68]That didn't hit him?
[219:32.32]Wait, what's going on?
[219:34.52]He's just the crocodile in the water apparently right now.
[219:38.04]Alright, that was weird.
[219:45.53]I don't know what's weak and what's not on him anymore.
[219:49.59]I'm gonna get, like, underneath him.
[219:50.61]This is wasted ammo.
[219:55.34]Wow, he was right there.
[219:59.88]Um, oh boy, you're in trouble.
[220:01.74]Oh boy, you're in trouble.
[220:04.72]Did I hit you with that?
[220:05.63]Yeah, I got that.
[220:10.37]I'm gonna have to switch to some normal ammo, but I have to make the shots count.
[220:13.63]Oh boy, he's coming for you.
[220:14.75]I got out of the way.
[220:18.61]Are you serious come on dude obey the rules of the road Didn't even stutter him a little bit Mega potion time That's not hurt him
[220:46.83]My T-Rex arm's not gonna work here now?
[220:50.66]Alright, my gun's low, so I can't do the power-up again.
[220:52.84]I gotta get in his hands.
[220:55.44]Right in the arms, right?
[220:59.22]Good block.
[221:00.38]That seemed to be... Maybe it was my weapon that was getting good crits on, maybe.
[221:03.80]Come on, scoot a little closer.
[221:05.68]Come on!
[221:07.44]There's too many targets for him.
[221:09.72]Yeah, he really has too many people here.
[221:11.16]Alright, he can't see me.
[221:14.10]I'm hiding in the dusk.
[221:17.88]oh it's not hurting him anymore alright maybe maybe he doesn't like run into the wall and get stunned boss thing oh hello I need like an aggro button
[221:45.73]He's just shaking it.
[221:47.39]We have to get that mud off of him.
[221:50.19]How do we get the mud off?
[221:53.65]You would roar right when I get my combo.
[221:56.04]We need to get that mud off this dude.
[222:03.64]Is there like a clean him?
[222:04.70]Oh, there we go.
[222:06.60]Under the chin.
[222:11.50]I can't really hit him under the chin.
[222:13.00]I have like an up attack, but it just bounces off.
[222:15.97]Yeah, I can get some chin shots.
[222:24.77]I did one.
[222:25.47]There we go.
[222:29.77]That's under the chin.
[222:33.13]What about piercing him under the chin?
[222:35.13]Crap.
[222:36.27]Gotta get over there, that's for sure.
[222:40.34]How has he still got this much health?
[222:42.66]Whoops.
[222:51.15]God damn it.
[222:53.05]I just got over here to you.
[222:54.31]Yeah, I need to get that.
[222:55.52]Spot.
[222:59.77]This is like a 30 minute fight.
[223:02.16]How much time do we have left, actually?
[223:05.10]We can't really look at the moment, but... Oh, no.
[223:09.40]Not this.
[223:09.92]Oh, my goodness.
[223:11.28]Come on, dude.
[223:14.24]Yeah, this is where it gets horrible.
[223:15.77]This is where you wipe.
[223:17.99]You lose your three lives.
[223:19.17]Yeah.
[223:19.87]That's terrible.
[223:20.41]There's a fine line between hitting him like...
[223:30.90]On the leg?
[223:33.84]Or not?
[223:34.94]Don't put this wall up here.
[223:35.98]I'm not going to be able to shoot him through this.
[223:37.74]God damn it.
[223:39.71]Maybe I can.
[223:41.09]Here we go.
[223:49.45]Somebody hit the toad.
[223:50.71]I'm stunned.
[223:51.77]On the ground.
[223:53.21]He's got so much health.
[223:55.36]He's unbeatable.
[223:58.82]Time for a little catnap.
[224:02.89]Alright, let's try this again.
[224:04.17]He's going for me.
[224:10.48]Ow.
[224:15.74]Come on, listen to the hero music.
[224:17.54]Channel it.
[224:21.24]He has to be getting close.
[224:24.38]You know why this thing is... No, don't let him roll.
[224:27.58]Why?
[224:28.66]Because I can't do any damage to him, really.
[224:32.56]I need to be like right underneath them is where I'm supposed to be.
[224:36.26]Imagine this is probably hell for you though.
[224:41.52]Wait, what's on the ground right here?
[224:43.04]Did he drop something?
[224:44.60]Did he drop something?
[224:45.34]Is there loot?
[224:46.78]What is this?
[224:50.16]I don't know.
[224:50.60]Let's just get in the middle of combat.
[224:53.34]We might not get another chance.
[224:54.78]We might not pick it up again.
[224:56.14]That's his shell.
[224:57.88]This mud.
[225:04.38]Be ready.
[225:04.74]Yeah, there's no health bar on the enemy.
[225:10.50]Just have to get him.
[225:11.32]You have to kill him.
[225:13.42]You have to kill him good.
[225:15.58]But, uh... Somebody help me.
[225:17.30]I need to move.
[225:18.60]Okay, I'm about to die.
[225:24.34]I have to get under him, too.
[225:25.32]That's the one problem.
[225:26.28]He's trying to get, like, under his belly.
[225:30.61]He's only vulnerable, like, on his butt and on his chest.
[225:34.45]He's, like, flipping around.
[225:39.32]I'm doing a great solid, like, 8 damage.
[225:44.58]Oh, you don't like doing 8 damage?
[225:46.60]What's wrong with that?
[225:48.36]Oh, yeah.
[225:48.64]My lance is pretty blunt right now.
[225:52.19]That's true.
[225:54.95]Hit him in the hands?
[225:55.67]That's what we were doing last time.
[225:56.79]Yeah, we tried.
[225:59.69]We tried hitting him in the hands.
[226:04.96]Whetstone's kind of a goofy mechanic.
[226:06.68]Tail and hands.
[226:07.44]That's what we did last time.
[226:09.38]Why does it feel like it's not doing it this time?
[226:11.54]That's weird.
[226:14.15]Oh, God.
[226:14.45]We're just like slugs.
[226:15.83]Here we go.
[226:16.87]We are.
[226:17.27]Hunters are like, please, just roll over.
[226:22.87]Make it stop.
[226:27.34]He's not like killing us.
[226:29.50]It's just taking a long time.
[226:30.38]No.
[226:31.16]Well, I got like three.
[226:32.66]Do you have any heal things left or no?
[226:34.24]No, I don't have any left.
[226:36.38]Alright.
[226:36.84]Mega nutrients.
[226:37.92]Okay.
[226:39.16]We have to stop him from doing whatever he's doing down there.
[226:42.28]Sure.
[226:42.52]I will.
[226:44.00]What is he doing?
[226:46.28]That was fucking cool.
[226:47.44]Alright.
[226:48.02]I only did like three damage, but that was fucking cool.
[226:57.55]Alright, this is it.
[226:58.63]He's done.
[227:01.31]He's running away.
[227:03.17]I think charge lance is way harder than mosquito gun.
[227:06.31]I mean mosquito... Mosquito weapon?
[227:09.48]Darth Maul.
[227:15.02]Slide.
[227:16.02]I have critical strike chance.
[227:25.53]I'm loaded.
[227:28.67]It's so slow.
[227:31.45]Why?
[227:32.09]He's going back to the stupid mud pile again.
[227:33.87]Of course he is.
[227:35.93]The one he went to last time when this happened.
[227:38.05]I think we just have to interrupt him faster.
[227:39.63]Alright, come on, man.
[227:45.51]I'm almost to him.
[227:46.69]I'm so slow.
[227:47.71]I have no stamina either.
[227:50.75]It's because it's a heavy ball gun.
[227:52.00]Yes, it is.
[227:56.05]I can't even move.
[227:59.33]Hey, look, now he's back here.
[228:01.01]Hey, look, he's here.
[228:02.15]He's buried.
[228:03.49]Oh, where did he go?
[228:04.31]Fuck off.
[228:06.51]What the?
[228:06.95]Why?
[228:07.37]Oh, this is so aggravating.
[228:09.56]Alright, we got him up.
[228:12.62]Like, why did it not hit him?
[228:14.40]Oh, I'm so irritated right now.
[228:15.78]It's, like, unbelievable.
[228:16.80]Fucking 45-minute boss fight.
[228:31.52]Why does it always have to hit him on the chin?
[228:47.52]I wish I had any other ammo left.
[228:50.75]He's dead.
[228:51.09]Thank fucking god.
[228:53.88]Woo!
[228:54.16]It was just like, that just got it again.
[228:56.28]I finally got some hits in.
[228:57.62]That just started to get fucking irritating.
[229:00.09]Yeah, it was mostly, I would blame myself, mostly.
[229:03.29]I would not.
[229:04.23]Because I didn't do much damage.
[229:07.89]Luckily, this was a DPS meter.
[229:11.57]No, there's not.
[229:14.71]Finally.
[229:17.92]Sharpening is overrated.
[229:19.38]Hey, my weapon can only sharpen to yellow.
[229:24.29]What do you want me to do?
[229:29.52]I have no green zone.
[229:35.08]Alright.
[229:35.58]We hunted the bear off.
[229:38.48]No tail drop, unfortunately.
[229:40.14]No tail.
[229:44.21]I tried to upgrade it, and I couldn't.
[229:46.17]It said not available.
[229:47.53]Stream's lagging.
[229:49.01]Comcast is a pile of garbage company.
[229:53.88]and uh for some reason uh hates my my life oh good thing we're seeing this cutscene yeah together even hey it's me glad you're back oh don't worry I think there's only one waifu in this game did you get a tail I guess I'll go round them up I don't know did I wait for us back at camp did you have to pick it up off of him uh you just skinned it oh well I skinned them
[230:24.33]Maybe you got a tip.
[230:25.69]Maybe you got lucky.
[230:26.71]You there.
[230:28.76]Are you part of the Fifth Fleet?
[230:31.40]Did I almost say stealth card?
[230:32.90]Then that means the Elder Crossing is upon us again.
[230:35.26]The years fly by faster than I can count them.
[230:43.76]An elf.
[230:46.11]I, too, am a hunter.
[230:47.03]No, this is fun.
[230:51.58]What's wrong with my character?
[230:53.96]Is he colorblind?
[230:55.54]What are you talking about?
[230:58.76]We're probably going to have to do some optional quests because we might not be strong enough to do the next thing.
[231:10.64]Yeah, I kind of noticed that we were struggling a little.
[231:13.58]I think we're a little bit underleveled.
[231:16.74]Praise be.
[231:17.42]Am I against changing weapons?
[231:18.40]No, not really.
[231:19.06]I'm not.
[231:19.24]I think I am going to change.
[231:20.24]I'll do the hammer for a little bit.
[231:23.54]I have a level 2 hammer, I think.
[231:25.56]I think the quest would be easier if we left the cat at home.
[231:43.42]Well, it has been a pleasure.
[231:46.28]I will follow my camp.
[231:48.40]I trust it will be of some avail.
[231:49.56]Do you have the others?
[231:50.06]Please pass.
[231:50.44]I'm safe.
[231:50.68]The rogue dualies?
[231:51.70]If you two feel so compelled, then we will cross paths again at the end of all of this.
[232:13.53]Hunting horn.
[232:14.37]No, I'm not going to do the hunting horn.
[232:17.16]We need a full party for the hunting horn.
[232:22.18]Do we know if the cats make it harder?
[232:24.68]No.
[232:25.72]I think they make it easier.
[232:27.36]They heal you, they do damage, and they draw aggro.
[232:31.52]I think the cats are there for people who play the game solo.
[232:34.52]Kind of.
[232:36.08]Because if you play this by yourself, imagine you were the gun guy, and you were the only target.
[232:42.67]Bereth Ridge, Bereth Claw, Bereth Scalp.
[232:44.50]It'd be impossible.
[232:47.14]Monster Bone, Monster Bone, Monster Bone.
[232:50.14]Bereth Claw.
[232:50.76]Monster Bone Medium.
[232:52.12]We were getting small Monster Bones before.
[232:53.86]Where's my tail?
[232:54.50]Remember when I said I got the tail?
[232:55.54]I don't see it.
[233:08.52]Let's try the Dual Blades.
[233:13.31]Hey, look, MosquitoMD, seven parts broken.
[233:17.17]Wait, what?
[233:18.53]You got, like, the card again, because my guy didn't do anything.
[233:21.07]I got the two.
[233:21.98]Wait, I got the heals and damage Overwatch cards?
[233:25.32]Well, you got heal and most parts broken.
[233:28.66]Hey, listen, 1v1 me and Dragon Ball FighterZ.
[233:36.49]Oh, it's on top of what you carved.
[233:37.53]Okay, that's cool.
[233:39.01]Was that enough monster fighting for everybody?
[233:41.01]Hopefully they got their fill.
[233:46.44]Let's try those dual slicers and see if we can make something cool with those dual slicers.
[233:50.21]What do you say, folks?
[233:51.19]I'm ready to swap again, too.
[233:53.67]I feel like you're doing a lot of weapon swapping.
[233:56.61]I've only used two weapons this entire stream.
[234:01.29]Speaking of streams that are no longer live.
[234:04.40]Are you not live anymore?
[234:06.02]I think I'm back.
[234:08.48]Speaking of streams that might not be live anymore, mine is dead.
[234:11.06]Good to see you.
[234:16.82]I swear to God, my internet just gets the flu every few weeks.
[234:23.50]It seems more frequent than that, actually.
[234:26.49]I know, it's kind of stupid.
[234:30.73]Kind of irritating.
[234:31.61]A lot of things irritate me, though, doesn't it?
[234:36.01]Well, it's just the icing on the cake.
[234:37.93]Alright, let's go.
[234:40.83]It is the whole cake, actually.
[234:44.15]Do you ever unlock the ability to carry two weapons at once?
[234:47.61]Probably... I would say no.
[234:52.86]I think the gun lances... I shouldn't give up on the gun lance yet.
[234:55.14]It was just that enemy in particular was armored 90%.
[234:58.08]Yeah.
[235:00.04]And every attack I tried to do just bounced off.
[235:03.36]Alright.
[235:03.74]I would pick up some more bounties.
[235:07.00]Because you should probably have most of them completed by now.
[235:11.93]Well, about that.
[235:14.35]Hunt a large monster.
[235:14.85]I don't think that I do.
[235:15.61]Let's do this one.
[235:17.75]Critical limited.
[235:18.83]Okay.
[235:21.07]Any deliveries?
[235:22.77]Already done.
[235:25.26]We have some new investigations that I don't even care about.
[235:27.58]Alright.
[235:34.50]Manage items.
[235:42.10]be easy enough to upgrade okay why can't I upgrade it only wants me to do roll back the upgrade okay so where is oops no where are all the items that we're collecting from monsters where are those saved where were they stored
[236:14.38]More ammo.
[236:15.56]Well, I'm not doing ammo right now because I'm going to store this shit.
[236:21.09]I'm going to put on... Change equipment.
[236:28.17]We're going to take the... Where are they?
[236:30.47]Match slicers.
[236:39.59]Am I going to switch ISPs?
[236:40.49]I'm about to murder someone.
[236:42.63]I cannot switch ISPs.
[236:45.83]There's only one ISP allowed in my entire state, I believe.
[236:51.02]Oh, there it is.
[236:51.78]On the second page.
[236:52.82]Hiding.
[236:53.24]No wonder I couldn't upgrade it.
[236:56.42]Don't make it easy to upgrade my currently equipped gear or anything.
[237:00.90]Hide it on page two.
[237:05.15]Do you know... Do you have any idea where the box is for... How can you tell where your stuff is?
[237:13.50]It's just... Are you by like the smith or home or something?
[237:17.20]Do you have to... Is there a different box?
[237:19.02]There's like one box that is... Has all your stuff in it.
[237:24.28]It's like a chest where you store everything.
[237:26.08]Yeah, but where are the monster parts?
[237:30.25]Oh, crap.
[237:32.01]There's three things I could have done and I picked one already.
[237:38.41]Am I like out of my mind?
[237:40.91]Maybe.
[237:41.77]Because I don't see any monster parts that we've been collecting in my item box.
[237:51.59]You can't see them normally if you go to sell.
[237:53.68]Alright, one sec.
[237:56.62]Ah, okay.
[237:57.72]There we go.
[238:00.40]I wanted to see.
[238:00.96]There we go.
[238:01.34]Baroth Tail.
[238:02.90]Nice.
[238:03.46]Alright.
[238:04.74]I'm interested.
[238:05.22]Let's go see what we can upgrade these swords into.
[238:14.37]Into the smith we go.
[238:17.72]Canada's internet, at least try to have some net neutrality.
[238:21.72]Yeah, I mean, this is not even like a net neutrality problem for me.
[238:25.20]It's just, for like 10 years, Comcast is the only company that is in half of these cities and towns in Massachusetts.
[238:36.01]And to get high speed internet from Verizon, all you can get is their like shitty default package.
[238:41.66]You can't get any higher speeds.
[238:44.31]unfortunate.
[238:47.41]Alright, let's see.
[238:50.95]Forge equipment.
[238:52.26]Weapons.
[238:55.18]Dual blades.
[238:58.40]Alrighty.
[239:00.96]I have matched slicers one.
[239:05.21]Matched slicers two.
[239:07.43]Cannot forge this equipment.
[239:08.73]Why?
[239:11.19]And why the hell not?
[239:13.05]Oh, because it has to be that
[239:16.25]Or we could do Bone Hatchets.
[239:20.01]Bone Hatchets is 140.
[239:20.89]Do Bone Hatchets, how many?
[239:27.34]Should we stick with Bone?
[239:28.12]I feel like that's gonna do Bone.
[239:35.32]Rending Beaks.
[239:39.90]Yellow Sharpness.
[239:41.42]Yeah, that sucks.
[239:43.80]These aren't even that much better.
[239:44.92]What about this one?
[239:48.34]Yellow sharpness on the bone blades.
[239:50.32]I don't know about that.
[239:55.14]I think I want to stick with this.
[240:00.08]I think I want the green.
[240:03.12]We'll go with the ore tree.
[240:07.38]Rending beaks has a green.
[240:09.20]We'll try to get down to this.
[240:12.96]See what it is.
[240:19.50]Let's go for it.
[240:23.16]Oh, fuck.
[240:24.56]I'm creating a new... Whatever.
[240:26.18]I just made a new one.
[240:31.32]Whatever.
[240:31.78]There's no difference, right?
[240:34.44]There probably is.
[240:34.92]That was $200 down the drain.
[240:36.58]Who cares?
[240:39.22]Wait.
[240:39.38]I don't understand.
[240:41.21]Why can I not make this?
[240:52.06]Huh?
[240:55.96]Something... You cannot forge this equipment.
[240:58.40]Is there a reason why?
[241:07.58]Missing materials.
[241:15.08]Alright, that... So you... Okay, that's just... You have to upgrade.
[241:19.21]Okay, I understand.
[241:22.13]A little confusing.
[241:22.83]It's alright.
[241:23.41]So we're going to this one.
[241:25.72]And then we're going to try to go down.
[241:28.04]Or maybe we... I don't know.
[241:28.58]We'll see.
[241:32.08]So I need... I need three.
[241:35.72]We need to hunt some Kulu Yakus.
[241:37.33]Because this will bring me down here.
[241:41.15]Or do matched slicers three.
[241:45.11]Which I'll probably get to that first.
[241:48.99]What's the difference here?
[241:49.65]154 versus 140.
[241:51.13]These do more damage and the sharpness is a little better than the other one.
[241:55.53]But this one has 15% affinity.
[242:01.86]No element.
[242:03.62]Alright, so we want to go down here.
[242:04.56]I want to get these.
[242:05.38]So these are what I currently have on.
[242:11.88]That's alright.
[242:12.38]This is what I'm looking for.
[242:16.65]Am I having fun yet?
[242:17.33]It's a big learning curve.
[242:19.01]Oh, yeah.
[242:25.81]The learning curve is not the problem for me.
[242:27.43]It's kind of... It's just a lot of information to take in at one time.
[242:35.06]Alright, I'll do some cat armor.
[242:37.40]Some real cat armor for you guys.
[242:39.04]What do we got?
[242:39.52]Leather.
[242:42.80]Bone.
[242:43.56]Alright, my cat's gonna look so cool.
[242:47.14]Do like a... Turban.
[242:51.00]Alloy Helm.
[242:52.00]Barath Helm.
[242:53.50]Feline Iron Sword.
[242:54.72]Mace.
[242:55.70]Puke Bow.
[242:58.38]I got plenty of bone, right?
[243:00.37]Should I make him a funny bone cat?
[243:03.51]Are we about to get rid of these guys?
[243:05.27]We're about to throw these guys away.
[243:06.55]I feel like I'm going to waste monster bones.
[243:23.55]Turban... No, I don't want... That uses a Kulu-Yaku-Plu.
[243:34.90]Alright, I'll give him the Funny Mask.
[243:39.36]20 points.
[243:41.16]Let's see... Whatever.
[243:42.30]Sometimes you have to make chat happy.
[243:44.18]And that's not even what you guys wanted.
[243:48.33]You wanted the Turban.
[243:51.49]I'm not wasting a Plume.
[243:52.81]That's...
[243:55.42]Yes, put it on now.
[243:56.39]Look it, there you go.
[243:57.13]Now he looks like a demon bunny.
[244:00.71]There.
[244:06.29]What about the other stuff?
[244:11.22]Can I do anything else?
[244:12.48]Armor?
[244:16.32]Baroth.
[244:17.44]Ooh.
[244:19.10]A Baroth shell?
[244:23.13]There's too many things to make.
[244:27.34]This thing looks so odd.
[244:29.16]Oh my god.
[244:32.20]Alright, yeah.
[244:32.74]Let me make the Walnut set.
[244:35.88]You really are.
[244:36.40]Yeah.
[244:38.28]I would love to be Mr. Walnut.
[244:39.77]That would be fantastic.
[244:47.95]Although, I don't really want to wear heavy shit.
[244:50.60]Do I?
[244:56.19]Is there like a weight thing in this game or no?
[244:58.31]I would assume not.
[245:02.64]Probably not.
[245:05.32]You have to wear that now.
[245:10.20]I need to first of all figure out if I want to use the slicers.
[245:14.24]I have no idea what the combos are to figure those out.
[245:18.45]I know there's like a demon mode.
[245:19.65]That's all I remember from testing it.
[245:25.36]Alright, manage items.
[245:26.68]Let's store some of this shit.
[245:28.36]Gunpowder level 2, very important.
[245:31.56]We don't need it with us, though.
[245:37.90]Or the fire herbs.
[245:41.08]These traps.
[245:43.99]I'm good with potions.
[245:49.79]Yeah.
[245:50.79]I'm good with potions for now.
[245:52.07]I'm gonna just do side quests anyways.
[245:56.82]Alright, I'm going to figure out how to leave the cat at home.
[245:59.76]Yeah, I just go to your house, right?
[246:03.44]Yeah, in the house.
[246:05.08]And then from the house.
[246:06.86]No, wait.
[246:09.30]Can you talk to the cat in the house?
[246:11.90]Manage Palico.
[246:14.56]My cat is so ugly.
[246:16.77]I made a bone mask for my cat for some reason.
[246:19.44]Um, where's the house?
[246:21.12]It's in a weird spot, right?
[246:22.76]Alright, your palico will not accompany you on quests.
[246:25.78]Meow be next time, it says.
[246:27.22]It's a direct quote.
[246:30.14]Your room, there it is.
[246:33.04]It's down.
[246:33.58]If you go to your room and talk to your cat, you can tell the cat never, ever come with me again.
[246:37.96]Don't ever follow me again.
[246:41.38]I'm gonna leave you here.
[246:44.04]It's down at the first level.
[246:46.29]It's by the, um... Yeah, it's like at the bottom.
[246:50.02]Kind of by the ship.
[246:53.98]Or at least the ship that's not up in the sky.
[246:55.82]Keep the cat.
[246:57.50]No, I'm not keeping the cat.
[246:58.64]We have to try at least one hard mode.
[246:59.86]We have to do it, like, for real.
[247:01.76]Yeah.
[247:02.82]This has not been for real.
[247:06.10]Alright, go in my room.
[247:07.94]Keep your cats.
[247:08.42]Be right back.
[247:11.28]Hey, he got rid of his cat first.
[247:12.92]I have to follow suit.
[247:13.82]I can't just keep my cat.
[247:17.24]There's no benefit to leaving the cat behind, except to just lose.
[247:22.15]You guys are not good enough to travel cat-less.
[247:24.05]Well, it's too late.
[247:27.17]It's too late.
[247:27.97]I'm not keeping the cat.
[247:28.89]He has to stay here.
[247:30.71]Look, this cat hasn't even gone to the bathroom yet.
[247:32.83]He needs to go in his litter box right behind him.
[247:40.09]There we go.
[247:40.55]Alright, he's... No, you guys don't understand.
[247:44.54]This is just a joke mission.
[247:51.28]this is not a real mission send him to the fire we're gonna claim our add-on bonuses what did I get fair wind char or oh wait did I have like the pre-order set retrieve fair wind charm what is that
[248:20.85]What is a fair wind charm?
[248:22.03]I don't know.
[248:33.68]Who knows?
[248:35.26]Etalyx, are you back?
[248:37.72]Put it on.
[248:38.34]Where is it?
[248:43.22]It's for a neck.
[248:48.87]Hmm.
[248:51.93]Okay.
[248:52.89]We're going to start one of these.
[248:54.57]Let's do one optional mission.
[248:57.39]Okay.
[248:59.83]I can't tell you that I'm going to be very, very good.
[249:03.97]By the way, everybody in my chat is freaking out.
[249:08.16]They cannot stand what you've done.
[249:10.98]Like leaving the cat here?
[249:12.18]Mm-hmm.
[249:12.89]Naving the cat is the worst thing that either one of us could have done.
[249:15.35]Guess what?
[249:15.59]I'm allergic to cats.
[249:17.09]And if all the cats in the world died, it wouldn't bother me one bit.
[249:22.62]Now you just made yourself a target.
[249:24.58]So you know why?
[249:25.08]Because I would have that many less allergies than I have now.
[249:28.34]Now you just made yourself like a troll target.
[249:30.34]You understand, right?
[249:33.97]Listen, dogs forever, and that's it.
[249:36.16]I'm going to post a new quest.
[249:38.20]Optional level three completed.
[249:41.02]You know how you can't get rid of flies and mosquitoes because other animals eat them?
[249:45.16]Why does it say... Like, cats aren't that, you know?
[249:47.68]Why does it say these are completed?
[249:49.04]Can we do these?
[249:49.92]Alright, let's do... What about... Where's the Kulu Kulu?
[249:56.47]Where's the Kulu Kulu?
[249:57.81]I need to hunt a Kulu Kulu Yakuku.
[250:02.22]Like, to catch it?
[250:03.56]I need to kill it.
[250:05.06]Because I need to skin it.
[250:09.54]Because I need to get specific Cuckoo's.
[250:16.74]Tell me more.
[250:17.56]So I'm going to post an optional quest, Camp Crasher.
[250:19.93]Okay.
[250:21.07]And you're going to take it.
[250:23.03]Do we only have level one?
[250:24.11]I only have level one optional quests.
[250:25.81]I have level two.
[250:27.91]Oh, so you're doing the ones we completed.
[250:30.46]Yeah, I mean, I think these are the only ones we have, right?
[250:33.26]Uh, I think if we go to the resource people, can we do, like, an investigation at the resource center?
[250:39.62]I mean, I guess, yeah.
[250:41.22]Anyways, I was just kidding.
[250:42.48]Cats can live, but only if you, only the ones you own.
[250:45.78]All the stray cats in the world.
[250:48.16]Kill those ones.
[250:48.68]No!
[250:51.10]Like, if a cat doesn't have an owner or whatever, then those ones.
[250:54.62]Well, what about, what about that documentary, Keddie?
[250:59.05]I watched that documentary.
[251:01.76]Uh, what?
[251:02.64]The documentary, Kedi.
[251:04.54]It talks about how there's, like, thousands of cats that are in, like, Istanbul.
[251:09.48]And they, like, run around and get fed and stuff.
[251:11.22]You want those all to die?
[251:12.12]They eat the rats?
[251:13.54]Yeah.
[251:13.74]We can just kill the rats, too.
[251:15.12]I manage investigations.
[251:16.29]Nobody likes rats.
[251:17.15]Why don't you guys like rats?
[251:18.27]You can tame a rat.
[251:19.15]Make a pet rat.
[251:20.27]Capture or kill.
[251:22.19]But I need to kill because I need the... I wanted some stuff.
[251:27.11]Capture all the cats.
[251:28.09]Hunting investigation.
[251:30.09]Round them all up.
[251:31.53]Okay, this one is... Alright, so this one, we can't die two times.
[251:37.25]This one's a super quest.
[251:39.96]There's a lot of investigations that we could do.
[251:42.86]Yeah, let's just do both of these.
[251:44.14]There's two hunt... What items do you need?
[251:48.94]What items do I need?
[251:51.08]Do you want to try to capture the Kulu Yaku?
[251:53.69]No, I don't want to capture the Kulu Yaku.
[251:56.62]Why?
[251:56.90]Because I need his stuff.
[251:58.84]I need his hide.
[251:59.78]I need his claws.
[252:00.70]I need to, like, carve him up.
[252:03.36]Okay.
[252:06.63]So is there anything else that you want to do besides hunting the Kulu Yaku?
[252:12.75]I'll hunt whatever.
[252:13.93]You get stuff from capturing as well.
[252:15.41]Cool.
[252:16.19]Yeah, you actually get more stuff.
[252:17.27]Capture gives more stuff.
[252:20.48]Okay, well, let's capture and then kill him.
[252:23.54]Alright, so from what I remember capturing, when they limp, when they're like, oh no, I'm limping, you have to put the trap in front of their path and set it up in front of them and they need to walk over it.
[252:36.71]Why do all these investigations look the same?
[252:39.65]I don't know.
[252:41.19]I have... This is in Wild Spire Waste.
[252:44.49]This time limit is 15 minutes, by the way, on one of these.
[252:48.98]I picked four and they're all 50 minutes.
[252:51.74]I'm not sure what the difference is.
[252:54.94]I don't know.
[252:55.52]Anyway, let's just do the capture one.
[252:58.55]Okay, capture.
[252:59.57]Are you taking both those blocks?
[253:01.87]Do you have more than one?
[253:03.12]I'm ticking one.
[253:04.22]Capture Kulu Yaku, Wild Spire Waste, max players four, time limit 50 minutes.
[253:10.34]Okay, and then the one underneath that is the same thing, but this is 15 minutes.
[253:15.29]No, this is capture again, but this one is 15 minutes.
[253:18.11]I do not have a 15-minute capture unless it's on page two.
[253:21.47]Okay, well, we're definitely not going to be able to do that one, so who cares?
[253:24.32]We can do the 50-minute one.
[253:25.58]Yeah, alright.
[253:26.36]I have that one checked.
[253:28.19]Gives bronze rewards.
[253:29.73]That's fine.
[253:30.65]We're pretty bronze players.
[253:31.65]Bronze and two, so it's true.
[253:34.03]Alright.
[253:34.89]Let's do it.
[253:35.73]So we just need to go to the expedition, right?
[253:39.44]How does that work?
[253:41.56]I think we both have to go to the expedition.
[253:44.68]Yeah.
[253:45.16]So just go to Wild Spire Grove, right?
[253:51.82]Wild Spire Waste.
[253:53.99]Hold on.
[253:54.33]I'm registering new bounties.
[253:56.51]So, alright, if I go here, can you just, like, are we gonna go there together?
[253:59.41]Uh, I think one of us has to go there first.
[254:03.49]Well, I'm going... Can you start, like, an expedition?
[254:06.33]I'm going to the southwestern... Or do an SOS?
[254:08.21]I'm going to the southwestern camp in Wildspire right now.
[254:11.06]Let's see what happens.
[254:11.68]Okay.
[254:12.38]Then let me SOS.
[254:15.16]One more time.
[254:18.56]Investigations are their own missions.
[254:25.55]Are they?
[254:26.73]I guess.
[254:27.47]Can I do them from the bounty board?
[254:29.32]From the quest board?
[254:30.42]Let's see.
[254:30.92]Post a new quest.
[254:33.08]Oh, yeah, you can.
[254:34.10]Oh, shit in my mouth.
[254:35.24]Are you serious?
[254:35.82]I just did this for no reason.
[254:38.66]Uh, yep.
[254:39.20]Why is the cat with me?
[254:42.11]Good question.
[254:44.50]We need traps, too.
[254:46.34]We do, yeah.
[254:47.34]We probably should figure out how to capture it before we go on the capture mission.
[254:51.28]You have to get him down to when he's limping and then put the trap in front of them and have them walk over it.
[254:56.28]Okay.
[254:56.76]That's it.
[254:57.18]Sounds complicated.
[254:58.22]It's difficult, but you can use the pre-order armor.
[255:01.46]Yeah, but I don't want to use the GameStop armor.
[255:03.78]Do we get pre-order armor?
[255:05.24]Yes.
[255:07.29]I didn't tell you about it because it's a crutch.
[255:09.99]Why is there a volcano here?
[255:11.77]Alright, so...
[255:14.00]I have to... Can I, like, join you or something?
[255:16.70]I'm just back in the regular old world hub because we have to buy traps or make them.
[255:22.71]And the expedition.
[255:26.05]Is there, like, a vendor around here?
[255:27.35]Uh, there's a general provisions vendor and they're $200 each.
[255:34.98]$200.
[255:35.42]Did you bring any coupons?
[255:36.80]I can't believe this shit.
[255:41.88]A boomerang.
[255:43.32]Binoculars, cool.
[255:45.08]Paid money for your armor you're not going to use.
[255:47.04]No, I didn't.
[255:47.54]What are you talking about?
[255:49.18]This game was $60.
[255:50.58]If you pre-order the game, it's still $60.
[255:52.48]I didn't buy, like, the pre-order digital deluxe version.
[255:59.13]I bought two just in case I mess up one.
[256:03.57]I think we also need tranquilizers.
[256:05.51]That sounds like your territory.
[256:08.95]Are you using the gun anymore?
[256:10.43]I'm not using the gun anymore.
[256:12.63]Oh.
[256:14.42]There's Trank ammo, so is one of us going to have to... Do you want me to use a ranged weapon?
[256:19.34]I think they're just Tranquilizers.
[256:21.22]I think you can just buy, right?
[256:24.59]I can buy Trank bowgun ammo.
[256:28.27]I think they're just Tranquilizer shit in the boxes at the start.
[256:32.93]I have a trap.
[256:35.99]I'm going to get a couple of traps.
[256:39.31]We can also make a barrel bomb.
[256:41.53]I'm kind of tempted.
[256:43.19]I'm tempted by the barrel bomb.
[256:44.51]You're going to cause us a lot of pain here if you do that.
[256:46.46]I'm buying two barrels.
[256:48.94]Item box.
[256:49.48]Where's the provision person?
[256:52.22]I swear to God.
[256:53.58]They're always right in front of me.
[256:57.38]I open up the fucking menu.
[256:58.70]It's because he's standing up on this giant pyramid box thing.
[257:02.34]Like, get him down here.
[257:03.48]I'm down here where I can interact with him.
[257:11.38]drugged meat raw meat that puts whatever eats it to sleep okay I'm gonna buy like I'm gonna make that I want to buy more than one okay I can only have two alright I have six drug meat would you like some food where'd you get the drugs I made it made it myself okay track ammo
[257:37.65]Triangle ammo, bow gun ammo used to capture monsters.
[257:40.33]Does it not use stuff from the box?
[257:46.13]Do you have to have... Oh my goodness.
[257:48.51]To be able to craft, you have to have the resources not in the box, but on your person?
[257:54.54]I don't know.
[257:55.28]I don't think so.
[257:55.72]It kind of seems like you do.
[257:58.24]Do you?
[257:59.78]Maybe you do.
[258:01.53]Or maybe you have to be in the box?
[258:02.91]Yes.
[258:07.09]Where is it?
[258:09.57]Demon drugs.
[258:11.47]No.
[258:12.39]Demon drugs.
[258:13.43]You just like shave file Satan's back hair.
[258:19.08]Drink it.
[258:19.84]Snort it.
[258:20.26]Alright.
[258:26.92]Flash pod.
[258:27.64]Screamer pod.
[258:28.56]Just climb into the box.
[258:32.18]Trank bomb.
[258:33.80]Shock trap.
[258:35.70]Net.
[258:39.25]Pitfall traps.
[258:44.05]This is the drug to me.
[258:45.15]Here's my box.
[258:48.15]You can craft from your box.
[258:52.25]How do you make a tranq bomb?
[258:55.89]Tranq knife.
[258:59.03]Can be shot from your slinger.
[259:01.27]You need tranq bomb and knives.
[259:03.87]How do you make gunpowder?
[259:06.57]I don't even remember.
[259:07.28]I made it and I don't even remember.
[259:11.92]Trank knife.
[259:13.22]Trank bomb.
[259:14.74]Trank bomb plus throwing knife equals trank knife.
[259:21.90]I actually just had sleep herbs.
[259:23.34]I don't know where parish rooms are.
[259:25.04]I don't think I have any of these materials necessary.
[259:34.72]Sleep herbs.
[259:36.06]We ran by a bunch of them.
[259:38.95]I have two.
[259:39.55]I have two.
[259:41.98]Nitro shrooms.
[259:46.62]Okay, well, let's see here.
[259:50.13]Sleep coating?
[259:51.89]No.
[259:52.07]Of course there's gunpowder levels two through four.
[259:59.79]Much stuff.
[260:01.19]Craftable life powder.
[260:06.54]Alright, I can get drugged meat.
[260:09.60]Mark's great bait for traps.
[260:16.21]I can make some drugged meat too, but is that going to do anything for us?
[260:18.63]I feel like that's not going to do anything.
[260:29.67]Nice cat.
[260:33.08]We've got to get going here.
[260:34.44]We're just staring at menus.
[260:37.92]You can't use drugged meat for capturing.
[260:40.48]So can we even capture a monster if we don't have, like, a tranq bomb?
[260:44.34]Or a tranq gun?
[260:46.88]I don't... I'm gonna say no.
[260:49.00]So let's just kill these motherfuckers.
[260:58.20]The supply box in the quest will give you the items you need, but you can't miss or mess up.
[261:05.78]Alright, did you hear that?
[261:09.25]No, I'm currently complaining about crafting what?
[261:11.27]Oh, um, so there will be, on these missions, there will be items in the chest that we can, like, tranq bombs and shit.
[261:18.63]Oh.
[261:19.59]So let's just get it done.
[261:20.87]That kind of takes the fun out of it.
[261:23.20]Come on, let's just get her done.
[261:28.12]That's my new saying now.
[261:29.42]That's my thing, I think.
[261:31.58]If you keep saying it, it might catch on.
[261:33.38]I think that's going to be, like, a thing that I say.
[261:35.15]It has a real, like, rural vibe to it, you know?
[261:37.41]Yeah, like...
[261:39.57]Get it done.
[261:40.31]But it's not, instead of get it done, it's like get er done.
[261:44.83]Alright, I'm posting a new quest.
[261:49.60]It's investigations.
[261:51.64]This is the one that's 15 minutes.
[261:53.40]Let's just, let's start with baby steps.
[261:55.88]This one's 50.
[261:56.68]Let's do baby steps.
[261:58.04]We're going to capture this.
[262:01.48]Okay.
[262:02.80]Players to capture investigation 50 minutes.
[262:07.03]We're going to start on the southwest camp.
[262:11.83]Okay.
[262:12.69]Ready to accept an available quest.
[262:14.49]Here it goes.
[262:18.38]Please read the following message upside down.
[262:24.14]I don't know what you're trying to say.
[262:26.48]I can't tilt my head that far.
[262:29.42]Are you coming?
[262:30.88]I am.
[262:32.36]I just accepted.
[262:33.69]What about meat?
[262:35.43]Should we eat anything first?
[262:37.56]I brought some sleep meat.
[262:38.46]You want some of that?
[262:39.36]I mean, like, for us.
[262:41.44]Oh, it says send nudes.
[262:44.24]Oh.
[262:47.56]Nice meme.
[262:49.06]Alright, you ready?
[262:50.74]Yeah, I'm standing by.
[262:51.95]I mean, it was upside down.
[262:54.79]True.
[262:55.37]A little extra effort had to go into that.
[262:57.09]How did you do that?
[262:59.47]How did you do that?
[263:05.61]Speaking of sleep meat,
[263:08.17]I am starting to get kind of tired.
[263:11.39]What you're saying is one or two more monsters.
[263:14.45]What you're saying is when we hit like the five and a half hour mark is probably when I want to get going.
[263:19.37]I can't believe it's already been four and a half.
[263:21.75]It's been more than that.
[263:23.61]No, it's not.
[263:24.87]No.
[263:25.17]That was a lie.
[263:26.25]That was a lie.
[263:27.52]Blatant.
[263:28.62]Brazen.
[263:29.30]Yeah.
[263:30.52]You couldn't have been more blatant with that one.
[263:33.63]Alright, let's go make some food.
[263:34.85]Alright, let me learn.
[263:35.77]How do you play this?
[263:36.93]Okay, capture quests.
[263:38.83]Uh-huh.
[263:39.55]We can trap Trank.
[263:41.49]Okay.
[263:43.69]Be sure to bring the traps and the tranquilizer.
[263:46.85]You'll need with you.
[263:47.74]You'll find them in the item box.
[263:48.60]You'll find them in the item box.
[263:51.24]Traps and tranquilizers can be crafted or bought from the provision stockpile.
[263:54.38]Okay.
[263:55.22]You must significantly weaken the monster before you can capture it, just like Pokémon.
[264:00.36]It'll begin to limp.
[264:01.14]Okay.
[264:02.50]Ready your traps.
[264:04.00]Don't deal too much more damage, as accidentally slaying the target will fail the quest.
[264:10.26]It can also be effective to place traps around the nest where the monster sleeps.
[264:15.66]Uh-huh.
[264:16.60]So if we can find a sleeping baby monster, we might be able to capture it, like, in 15 minutes.
[264:20.56]You know what I mean?
[264:21.42]Once you've successfully snared a monster in your trap, select a tranq bomb and press square to throw it at your target so it hits the monster's face.
[264:30.60]Right in the face.
[264:31.77]You have to hit him in the face.
[264:35.37]You can also use tranq ammo when you're using a ranged weapon.
[264:38.45]Good thing I threw away the ranged weapon.
[264:40.05]Alright, so in the face with the tranq bomb, remember.
[264:44.74]In the face, yep.
[264:46.83]Step one.
[264:47.53]Come over here and let's buy some food.
[264:49.90]Step one.
[264:51.46]Let's be hunters.
[264:52.44]Who buys their own food as a hunter?
[264:54.46]Let's go make some food.
[264:55.48]There's an easy shock trap in here.
[264:58.16]I already have some traps.
[265:00.56]Just take the free medicine.
[265:02.60]I didn't know I was going to get all this.
[265:05.96]This is like easy mode.
[265:07.86]This is just how it works.
[265:10.30]Look at this streamlining.
[265:11.83]I got my wet stone.
[265:13.75]Don't even have to prepare anymore for missions.
[265:17.24]Uh, where is the tranq bomb?
[265:18.38]So, easy tranq bomb.
[265:19.16]Remember, it is, you have to throw it in, hit it in the head.
[265:22.72]Okay, so is the capture net infinite?
[265:24.50]It is.
[265:25.54]Um, I don't, that, I don't, that's not how it works.
[265:29.58]You have to use the, wait, where's my traps?
[265:34.25]What the heck?
[265:35.87]Hey!
[265:36.17]Alright, wait, do I, what am I holding here?
[265:43.93]Supply.
[265:45.38]No, I don't want to take any more of them.
[265:46.24]Why can't I take... You can't carry any more.
[265:48.66]Do I already have them?
[265:50.08]Can I fight with this?
[265:52.73]What?
[265:53.19]How do I... Hold on, hold on.
[265:54.49]Wait, wait.
[265:55.07]I gotta get... My item pouch.
[265:59.43]I do have them, so where the hell are they?
[266:00.75]Am I just missing them?
[266:02.13]Fishing rod, capture net.
[266:05.27]Ration potion, easy shock trap, tranq bomb, nutrients.
[266:11.19]Isn't it like an actual...
[266:14.54]It's not the capture net.
[266:17.08]What are you doing?
[266:19.24]Nice bug eyes.
[266:19.94]Alright.
[266:22.83]Let's start investigating.
[266:26.03]Alright.
[266:26.57]Sure thing.
[266:29.23]Why can I not use this?
[266:32.31]Oh, the trap tools are crafting materials.
[266:34.19]Okay.
[266:34.31]They're just a component.
[266:37.93]Alright.
[266:39.01]You have a trap and I have a trap.
[266:41.53]I have two traps and the easy trap oven.
[266:44.27]Let's go.
[266:44.95]Take your easy trap oven.
[266:46.43]Let's go find this guy and let's capture it.
[266:48.89]Okay.
[266:49.65]Let's try to find him like where he's sleeping, you know?
[266:52.07]We're going to set the traps up.
[266:54.23]We're going to make him run to his nest.
[266:56.26]Alright.
[266:56.48]Let's find some like other monsters and kill them, right?
[267:00.06]Like the little baby ones.
[267:02.42]Eat them.
[267:03.16]Like cut the meat out of them.
[267:04.48]These things are cool.
[267:08.32]These things are cool.
[267:08.80]Like kill them.
[267:12.59]Like that?
[267:14.05]Yeah, just like that.
[267:14.91]They're not dying, Etalyx.
[267:18.19]Why?
[267:18.51]They're not dying.
[267:20.27]No, they're not.
[267:22.79]These stupid goats.
[267:24.64]They are quite healthy as it happens.
[267:27.08]He'll be.
[267:30.40]Alright, let's go.
[267:32.46]No, but seriously, we need to kill a monster in like a small one.
[267:36.72]And then cook the meat so that we're healthy and ready for the fight.
[267:41.38]This thing, by the way, you don't have to worry.
[267:43.00]This thing's a chump.
[267:43.66]What, this one?
[267:45.66]No, this cuckoo cuckoo is a chump.
[267:48.58]It's not like a dangerous baron.
[267:51.14]What was that thing's name?
[267:51.92]Barret?
[267:54.60]Barret?
[267:55.46]Yeah.
[267:57.56]Now, this thing's going to be easy.
[267:58.52]This thing is a glorified... It's a glorified default enemy.
[268:08.91]Yeah, start breaking eggs, and then it'll come out.
[268:13.53]Okay?
[268:14.67]Do you remember if the monster we're looking for had eggs?
[268:17.03]Like, if it was a bird?
[268:18.39]Yeah.
[268:19.74]Okay.
[268:21.02]Curious.
[268:23.62]Do you think it might have laid some eggs?
[268:26.04]Yeah, so just stomp on that egg.
[268:29.28]See, let me help you.
[268:30.30]Well, if we... If we take... Why does that hit you?
[268:34.16]I don't know.
[268:34.44]Why does that hit you?
[268:36.08]If we take it far enough away, maybe, right?
[268:38.90]Well, you broke it.
[268:41.47]You failed the field day.
[268:45.27]Well, that's a shot for sure.
[268:47.71]That was an undie shot.
[268:50.73]That was an absolute undie shot.
[268:53.05]That's alright.
[268:54.52]Is this him?
[268:55.72]No, that's a different animal.
[268:58.04]Yeah, it's like a Stegosaurus.
[268:59.96]No, it's not.
[269:00.74]It's like an Angliosaurus.
[269:02.12]I think they have the scent here.
[269:03.20]We need to just keep going this way.
[269:04.76]It's like an Anglo Saxon.
[269:07.98]Alright, here's a small monster.
[269:09.86]Go kill these small ones and take the meat.
[269:12.28]No, what's with you and the meat right now?
[269:13.78]I want to cook.
[269:14.50]You said we were going to eat food.
[269:16.27]Let's just... Yeah, but that's too late now.
[269:18.01]This is going to be so easy.
[269:19.85]We do field cooking.
[269:21.07]No, we don't need to do field cooking.
[269:22.39]We've got to capture a monster.
[269:23.59]You don't need to put a banquet out here to get plus 10 stamina.
[269:29.01]That's what you thought last time when we took 40 minutes to kill a monster.
[269:35.61]Yeah.
[269:35.91]Alright, this is the first time I've used melee weapons in this whole game so far.
[269:43.32]Uh, have fun.
[269:47.82]I actually would rather not be locked on.
[269:50.36]Yeah, I kind of don't like the lock on actually.
[269:53.84]As it happened.
[269:54.66]It was not in the previous games.
[269:58.20]There's no lock on.
[269:59.08]Alright.
[269:59.91]I'm going to skin these guys.
[270:02.29]It was pretty easy, honestly.
[270:03.97]Don't know what you were whining about.
[270:05.49]What are you talking about?
[270:09.63]Trying to avoid, you know, being prepared and all that.
[270:13.18]I want to smell some more stuff to find where the monster is.
[270:18.78]Is there a way to, like, share?
[270:22.15]A way to share...
[270:23.50]Like, for example, if I do this, can I share with you?
[270:31.28]Maybe.
[270:35.52]Lock-on has been in the last five games.
[270:40.27]Try that again.
[270:41.65]You could lock-on in Monster Hunter Wii U. I feel like that was something I could not do.
[270:46.29]I always do it one too early.
[270:48.01]One more time.
[270:49.27]I'm going to get it right.
[270:52.75]This is the first game with a full lock on.
[270:54.43]Yeah, I mean, I played a lot of Monster Hunter for the Wii U. By a lot, I mean like, I don't know, 30 hours?
[270:59.79]That's not very much.
[271:01.63]Footprints.
[271:01.95]We tracked them yet?
[271:05.51]Mm-hmm.
[271:07.23]Level up.
[271:19.41]Okay.
[271:20.89]Are these for heals or do you get buffs from this?
[271:23.79]Never mind.
[271:25.03]I think you just get buffs from the food, right?
[271:27.49]I mean the food that you cook yourself.
[271:30.26]I bet if we killed these... Have we killed these guys before?
[271:32.42]I bet they give different monster parts.
[271:35.06]Which guys?
[271:35.52]These like super armored ones.
[271:38.46]Oh.
[271:39.42]Turtles.
[271:40.50]Let's see what happens.
[271:44.74]I bet this will end well.
[271:45.60]It's going to end fine.
[271:48.77]These are the kind of ones that look easy, and then they all swarm you all at the same time.
[271:54.75]Yep.
[271:55.61]Kind of like what's happening.
[271:59.14]Oh, he actually died pretty fast.
[272:06.20]Weapons losing in sharpness.
[272:07.36]What is the whetstone?
[272:08.38]You get infinite whetstones.
[272:10.47]Was there infinite whetstones in the last game?
[272:12.09]I don't think there was.
[272:22.10]Yeah, you can do demon mode.
[272:23.76]Where did that guy just come from?
[272:25.32]Hold on for now.
[272:30.30]No, he's not there.
[272:32.34]Beautiful.
[272:34.58]You just stay right back over there, buddy.
[272:37.68]While we take all the meat.
[272:39.26]The meat.
[272:40.18]There's others.
[272:40.94]They come up from the mud.
[272:45.84]And they're very upset.
[272:47.02]Alright.
[272:49.54]Let's go.
[272:51.90]He's this way.
[272:52.92]We actually have him on the radar now.
[272:54.28]Are you going to attack me or not?
[272:58.54]Let's go and fight Cuckoo.
[273:01.92]Oh, yep.
[273:02.54]The answer is yes.
[273:03.46]He is going to attack me.
[273:06.48]Hey, listen.
[273:07.00]Dodge.
[273:08.15]Do you know how to dodge?
[273:10.85]We might as well just get rid of this guy.
[273:16.33]Oops.
[273:19.82]Oops.
[273:20.12]Sorry.
[273:20.95]Got a cop in the crossfire over here.
[273:22.51]That's, uh, triangle and circle does, like, other stuff, right, together?
[273:30.09]Uh, yes, usually.
[273:39.50]Okay, he's dead.
[273:43.62]He died.
[273:46.36]Is this RuneScape?
[273:47.50]No, this is Monster Hunter: World.
[273:50.84]The whole world is at your fingertips.
[273:52.26]We should just play RuneScape and stuff.
[273:55.22]Don't give him any ideas.
[273:56.26]Alright, where is he?
[274:02.53]He's up there.
[274:05.91]Follow the bees.
[274:08.89]Alright.
[274:10.27]I gotta scan the castodon.
[274:12.01]Follow the bees.
[274:12.71]Do we know where he's at?
[274:13.71]Yeah, top left.
[274:14.39]Alright.
[274:16.89]And we gotta capture him.
[274:19.93]Not kill.
[274:22.18]Do not kill him.
[274:23.08]We need to beat the absolute hell out of him, but... Until he starts limping.
[274:28.18]Gotta teach him a lesson.
[274:29.40]And then we have to go in front of him.
[274:32.06]And once we're in front of him, we put down the shock trap, and then we tranquilize him.
[274:35.11]There he is.
[274:35.55]He's actually coming to us right now.
[274:38.93]And that just swelled.
[274:42.59]There he is.
[274:43.21]How do I equip my slingshot again?
[274:47.87]I don't know.
[274:48.47]I don't have any rocks.
[274:50.88]Alright, take us out.
[274:54.22]What if we just followed him around until he eventually got back to his nest, and then we just trap him without even fighting?
[275:00.60]No, that's impossible.
[275:01.93]Let's go demon mode.
[275:02.83]Ow.
[275:13.79]He's running.
[275:14.77]Ouch, sorry.
[275:15.67]It's my first time playing with a melee weapon.
[275:19.10]I gotta have a little practice.
[275:20.24]Yeah, guys.
[275:21.06]Come on.
[275:21.52]Get him some slack.
[275:24.38]Come on.
[275:29.66]Okay.
[275:33.85]Using the bug.
[275:44.91]Whoops.
[275:45.45]No, he's going with the rocks.
[275:57.20]And hello there.
[275:58.95]That was good.
[276:16.68]You do a lot more damage like this.
[276:18.62]Alright, is he hurt?
[276:22.10]On his back.
[276:23.42]Oh, what?
[276:27.22]I thought I could get on his back too.
[276:28.54]I was like, oh, he's on his back.
[276:31.02]Maybe I can do that.
[276:31.80]I don't know how you like... Can I just tame him and ride him around for the rest of the game?
[276:38.53]That'd be cool.
[276:42.81]Is he limping yet?
[276:43.78]Do we know?
[276:44.82]Hold on.
[276:46.24]Is he dead?
[276:48.40]I don't know.
[276:49.32]Let him up.
[276:50.28]Just let him get up.
[276:53.88]Let him breathe.
[276:55.44]You knocked the wind out of him.
[276:56.40]He landed right on his back.
[276:58.16]We should have been getting trapped.
[277:01.34]He's not quite done.
[277:02.54]It does not seem like it.
[277:10.70]Doesn't seem like it.
[277:13.90]Ow.
[277:18.48]This weapon is, like, way more fun.
[277:24.44]Maybe it's just against this guy.
[277:25.52]Alright, there he goes.
[277:29.91]Chase him!
[277:31.61]He's not limping, I think.
[277:33.81]He's just got some swagger.
[277:35.15]No, he's just kind of a goofball.
[277:40.64]It's nitro shrooms.
[277:41.30]That's how you make explosives.
[277:43.02]Eat.
[277:44.40]Grind.
[277:47.04]Actually, it's not a bad idea.
[277:48.34]Yay.
[277:50.32]Slide up.
[277:55.65]He's still running.
[277:57.83]Far away.
[277:58.59]He's probably going back to his nest at this point.
[278:03.27]Here he is.
[278:03.59]He broke the egg initially.
[278:04.91]He's got his rock.
[278:10.38]I was trying to... I just bounced off of his rock somehow.
[278:17.99]Yep.
[278:18.31]His rock is a shield.
[278:21.69]Believe it or not.
[278:23.59]So you got to get behind him on his tail.
[278:27.42]I think we're hitting each other.
[278:29.06]You might be right.
[278:37.88]What?
[278:39.10]Come on, man.
[278:39.90]That lock-on.
[278:43.00]As much as I want to turn the lock-on on, I need to turn it off.
[278:47.01]There we go.
[278:47.33]Alright.
[279:03.29]Is he dead yet?
[279:04.21]Wait, wait, wait.
[279:05.79]I think he's ready.
[279:06.31]Alright, stop.
[279:07.57]I'm looking in the middle.
[279:08.67]He's drooling.
[279:09.41]I think that means he's ready, right?
[279:10.68]Is he drooling?
[279:11.72]I think he's drooling.
[279:12.38]Alright, do we have any extra things?
[279:14.60]I want to see what this does.
[279:19.12]I'm afraid to attack him.
[279:23.42]What is he doing?
[279:26.88]I'm going to catch him in my net.
[279:28.90]No, alright.
[279:29.52]I got a shock trap.
[279:30.48]I'm going to try to get in front of him.
[279:31.91]Where's his nest?
[279:34.23]He's ready.
[279:34.59]I don't even use those things.
[279:35.85]You just got to put it down.
[279:36.75]You can just stand still and put it down.
[279:38.71]Alright, let's see if we can just get him to walk over this.
[279:41.09]I'm going to put mine down right here.
[279:42.82]There we go.
[279:45.86]Now walk over to me.
[279:48.54]And then get it.
[279:49.36]He's going to jump.
[279:50.18]He's going to do the thing where he's getting another rock and he's going to leap over it.
[279:54.28]He's going to jump over it, isn't he?
[279:55.30]Alright, there it is.
[279:56.02]Nope, hit the shock.
[279:57.02]And then when he's down, Frank bomb.
[280:00.91]Oh, right in the face.
[280:02.41]Okay, right in his face, please.
[280:04.80]Is that working?
[280:05.96]Is this working?
[280:07.34]Crank bomb!
[280:08.95]Hello!
[280:09.39]What happened?
[280:14.57]What happened?
[280:15.67]I don't know.
[280:16.21]I don't think he's ready.
[280:17.69]He's not weak.
[280:18.61]He has to be wounded.
[280:20.29]Everyone was saying he was drooling.
[280:21.43]He was ready.
[280:22.69]He's drooling.
[280:23.84]No, he has to limp.
[280:26.24]Everyone just said he was ready.
[280:27.34]You got trolled.
[280:28.70]Did we just get baited by my chat saying he's drooling, he's ready?
[280:32.34]I only used one bomb.
[280:33.90]How many did you use?
[280:34.52]All four?
[280:35.02]I used four of them.
[280:36.49]Wow, that's dedicated.
[280:38.47]He has to be limping, not drooling.
[280:41.65]What do you mean no one said that?
[280:42.69]Like 10 people said that.
[280:45.14]He's right here, isn't he?
[280:45.88]I know.
[280:46.02]I'm just trying to get in a position.
[280:51.64]Alright, well, let's do it again.
[280:52.82]There you go.
[281:05.85]I'm just swinging in the wrong direction, honey.
[281:21.05]Hey.
[281:29.36]Really?
[281:29.94]In midair he hit me with that?
[281:31.26]Okay.
[281:33.98]Under his toes.
[281:39.83]Alrighty.
[281:41.75]He's getting a little bit more aggressive now.
[281:43.39]You have to jump every time.
[281:51.08]What am I hitting?
[281:51.88]The rock every time?
[281:55.77]Oh, my sword is... I need to... I need to whetstone.
[282:00.91]Ow, wonder.
[282:03.83]Not the best time.
[282:05.07]I'm a little stunned right now.
[282:10.81]A little beside myself.
[282:12.01]We don't have the little kitties to... Oh, dear.
[282:14.25]There he goes again.
[282:15.15]I need to use a whetstone.
[282:18.63]My sword is just in dire need.
[282:22.26]There we go.
[282:26.47]Gotta get some sharpened blades in between fights.
[282:29.55]50 minutes.
[282:31.03]That's why we have 50 minutes, man.
[282:32.43]Can you imagine trying to do this in 15?
[282:34.07]There's no way.
[282:35.67]You would need to have some severe damage to do this in 15 minutes.
[282:39.66]Alright, so what if when we jumped over there it was actually just like an insta-death chasm?
[282:44.38]I'd laugh.
[282:46.08]That would be quite the funniness.
[282:48.49]The funniness?
[282:49.03]Yeah, there would be some funniness there.
[282:51.89]We only have your trap left, just if we're curious.
[282:55.11]Uh, yes.
[283:04.36]And let's get back into Demonblade!
[283:11.24]There we go.
[283:13.24]Ow.
[283:13.82]I got a little overconfident there.
[283:20.23]My body is not ready for that Alright, so we need to be very cautious here I
[283:47.79]Where?
[283:49.09]He's on the ropes.
[283:50.14]Where is my trap?
[283:51.64]It's the shock trapper.
[283:53.68]Easy shrink.
[283:54.56]Okay, easy shock trap.
[283:55.62]Where do we want to lure him to is the question.
[283:57.43]We got to go in front of him.
[283:58.53]He's going to bring his rock.
[284:00.37]You just got to get in front of him.
[284:01.89]Okay.
[284:02.29]Looks like he's going this way.
[284:03.31]Yes.
[284:06.32]Clearly like going across the bridge.
[284:08.48]Across this bridge.
[284:10.16]Got to predict his moves.
[284:11.69]Alright.
[284:12.17]So which way is he going?
[284:13.07]The fork over here on the right?
[284:15.09]He's going back to his lair, wherever that is.
[284:18.33]Did I set it down like... Let's see.
[284:20.71]If he takes a right... No, he's taking a left.
[284:23.27]Where is he going?
[284:24.47]Is he jumping?
[284:24.85]He's not going to jump up there, is he?
[284:25.79]Is he going to climb this?
[284:28.57]He's going to climb this.
[284:29.65]Oh, he just like... Oh, come on.
[284:31.91]No.
[284:32.13]Why?
[284:36.71]Oh, damn it.
[284:37.63]How can you even do that?
[284:39.17]Wait, you can go up here.
[284:44.85]It would help if he dropped the rock.
[284:49.60]Okay, he's in here.
[284:52.54]I don't know which way he's going to go.
[284:57.33]Alright, you put... Okay, well... There we go.
[285:01.11]Now throw the bomb right in his face.
[285:04.24]Where am I?
[285:04.98]Oh, we just won.
[285:09.36]Did we?
[285:10.98]He doesn't... Alright, well... Return to the camp with the current party.
[285:15.09]We have ten seconds.
[285:16.15]Alright, we'll pick up... We did it.
[285:19.11]Nice job.
[285:19.65]Perfect.
[285:21.16]He just came in to eat the rock he was holding.
[285:23.04]Yeah, he just came in for a little snack, but he was so tuckered out that just being shocked put him down.
[285:29.29]So we got... Oh, right.
[285:32.03]So you do get a lot of stuff.
[285:37.48]I like it.
[285:42.46]Two special rewards.
[285:43.54]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[285:45.18]And you got Kulu Yaku beak.
[285:47.12]Uh-huh.
[285:48.52]And Kulu Yaku scale.
[285:49.50]We just gave him the old electric chair.
[285:52.67]How long did that take?
[285:56.49]20 minutes.
[285:57.73]We could probably do that in 15.
[286:01.07]Got a capture novice award.
[286:07.13]Hey, I got a thing.
[286:11.49]I picked up things.
[286:14.02]You got two materials collected.
[286:16.96]Good job.
[286:18.08]You did it.
[286:28.04]Apparently the game only adds health just because you're in multiplayer, not for every party member you have.
[286:33.86]So two players is actually, I guess, the hard mode.
[286:36.46]Okay.
[286:38.42]if you had four players they have the same amount of health supposedly so I'm gonna head back I want to see what else I need to get the next level here return from expedition yeah I'm playing with Etalyx right now if you don't know and I'm gonna say let's do let's try to do one more like monster let's go for the next quest and then that's where I'm gonna call my stream
[287:08.22]Okay.
[287:08.86]Sounds good.
[287:09.28]That'll probably bring us to about five and a half hours.
[287:11.86]Six hours.
[287:12.30]You returned home.
[287:13.90]Yes.
[287:15.36]Would you say we want to do one more optional one?
[287:18.27]Let's go for the main pie here.
[287:20.85]Just do some upgrades.
[287:23.89]Are you supposed to do a whole optional in between?
[287:25.99]Isn't that why the other one was so hard?
[287:29.05]We just did one.
[287:30.83]Yeah, we did one optional.
[287:33.17]We just did one.
[287:33.71]I mean, we can try it.
[287:35.13]I don't care.
[287:35.69]We can try it.
[287:36.71]It's going to take longer than an hour.
[287:38.05]We just did one.
[287:39.65]If you want to be done in 30 minutes, the last one took like 50.
[287:43.63]Search points.
[287:44.39]Well, I'm just saying, let's get one more monster done.
[287:49.57]One more deliveries.
[287:50.81]By the way, you know you can just like wander around in the expedition area and find the monsters.
[287:56.99]The ones that we haven't killed yet.
[287:59.42]Yeah.
[288:00.86]They're there.
[288:01.70]But there's no official sinister shadows in the swamp.
[288:05.46]You still get stuff.
[288:06.90]I mean, all we're doing right now is looking at, like, a 45-second cutscene and then going and hunting the monster.
[288:13.03]Apple Enthusiast.
[288:15.35]Is that, like, a fruit, or are you talking about, like, iPads?
[288:19.13]Give me that one.
[288:19.67]That was a good one.
[288:20.75]How are you today?
[288:24.33]Uh, actually, let me go back.
[288:25.41]Let's go to the blacksmith.
[288:29.23]Sinister Shadows.
[288:30.25]Is that your quest?
[288:33.05]Sinister Shadows in the Swamp is my current quest.
[288:40.98]My PlayStation 4 just turned on the, like, ultra fans.
[288:47.14]Working in overdrive.
[288:48.32]Okay.
[288:51.66]Well, it takes a lot to, you know, render graphics in 720p these days.
[288:56.80]It does.
[288:57.18]Okay, upgrade.
[289:00.86]Upgrade my slicers.
[289:03.52]And I have the materials to do either one of these two things.
[289:08.38]The question is, which one of these do I want?
[289:12.81]I think I was going to do this one, right?
[289:13.95]154.
[289:14.97]Yeah, it's going to be this one.
[289:20.51]1,000, 1,000, both 1,000.
[289:21.07]We're going to do the Kulu Yaku Beak Blades.
[289:29.31]I need to water-cool my PS4.
[289:30.67]Let's give it a go.
[289:40.62]Mm-hmm.
[289:45.80]And we can also do... This is, I'm assuming, beak blade 2, but this, on the other hand... What is this?
[289:51.36]Okay, now I'm going to be doing some actual damage.
[290:00.79]I need some other material that I don't have.
[290:07.37]But they look cool.
[290:11.13]What armor?
[290:15.12]Should I be the walnut?
[290:18.74]What do you think?
[290:29.24]I could be Mr. Walnut for a little while.
[290:33.70]And I could actually... Hmm.
[290:34.88]What do I think?
[290:37.44]Should I be Mr. Walnut?
[290:41.58]Are we going for Walnut Man?
[290:45.98]Can make them both.
[290:50.84]Stamina Thief.
[290:51.78]What the hell is that?
[290:54.64]That's cool.
[290:56.20]Is that even a question?
[290:57.34]I mean, you know what?
[290:58.38]That is... Yeah.
[291:02.88]Walnut.
[291:07.84]Why am I even asking this question?
[291:23.27]Alright, so now...
[291:30.50]What about helmets?
[291:34.64]Nah, the helmet I can have is fine.
[291:41.18]Now I look fucking terrible.
[291:45.55]Well, here we are.
[291:48.81]What a great skill to have with dual wielding blades.
[291:59.90]Alright, should be good.
[292:01.02]Got the new weapon.
[292:01.80]Got my walnut chest.
[292:03.46]Alright, let's see here.
[292:08.36]Did I miss any bits?
[292:09.28]Let me check.
[292:12.63]Real quick.
[292:16.11]Thank you, Grizzly1620 for the $1.
[292:18.17]For whatever reason, I was craving McNuggets today, and I ordered like 40 of them, but only ate 20, and now I feel sick hours later.
[292:26.48]Well, that's what happens when you eat McDonald's.
[292:29.83]McDonald's is really great for the four and a half minutes that you are just insatiable hunger.
[292:37.01]Biting into a Big Mac when you're really hungry is one of the greatest feelings in the world.
[292:41.53]But that feeling is subsided immediately.
[292:44.12]After about 12 minutes of eating McDonald's, you look at it and you just say,
[292:50.27]I'm not doing that again.
[292:51.59]I'm not going to go there again.
[292:53.78]And you'll just... It's kind of like saying you're not going to drink ever again.
[292:57.08]You know, you have a bad experience.
[292:58.76]I puked.
[292:59.70]It sucked.
[293:00.28]I'm never drinking again.
[293:02.76]And you drink like fucking two weeks later.
[293:08.29]But... Put him in the fridge and then microwave him tomorrow.
[293:12.93]Maybe they'll be still good.
[293:16.39]Smitten Sam, thanks for the $1.
[293:17.25]This guy has 2500 HP.
[293:17.75]Good luck.
[293:21.41]He was referring to Craterhead.
[293:26.33]But thank you, Smitten Sam.
[293:28.42]Hydra725, thanks for the $1.
[293:30.32]Pee-pee-poo-poo.
[293:31.04]Alright.
[293:37.96]Cosmo7920, thanks for the $1.
[293:41.69]They say Mr. Destructoid.
[293:43.81]I'm not entirely sure why, but they did.
[293:46.77]MostlyLost gave $4 in a row here.
[293:50.87]Jermo, just want to let you know, good luck.
[293:52.11]We're all counting on you.
[293:54.63]Hopefully we've paid off.
[293:57.93]Paint Me Pastel, thanks for the $1.
[293:59.79]I had these lying around.
[294:00.59]Please take them.
[294:01.13]I think you'll like 11 out of 10.
[294:03.76]Well, I do.
[294:04.24]I do like it.
[294:04.72]Thank you for the $1, dude.
[294:06.10]Appreciate that.
[294:08.80]Hot Wings, thanks for the $1.
[294:11.24]TyX, thanks for the $1.
[294:12.42]Jermo's a cute, cute, cute.
[294:16.05]That means I'm super cute.
[294:18.13]And then Cosmo.
[294:19.07]Thank you, Cosmo, again for your $2.50.
[294:22.39]Upgrade.
[294:25.05]Thank you so much, dude.
[294:26.23]Give me one more second.
[294:29.71]Great tax.
[294:30.31]Thanks for the $1.
[294:31.07]Good job killing the pukey pukey with your big old rooty tooty point and shooty.
[294:37.28]Thanks, dude.
[294:39.70]Let's see.
[294:40.22]Only a couple more.
[294:40.84]DubskyDude, thanks for the $1.
[294:42.14]Asked the Pukey Pukey to tell a story about how he ate an entire crate of Oreos and puked all over his mother's nest.
[294:47.82]Grizzly1620, thanks for the $1.
[294:49.30]You guys rock.
[294:52.39]Appreciate it.
[294:55.19]Alright.
[294:55.63]I'm ready.
[294:57.87]Let's try this quest.
[295:01.89]Post new quest.
[295:05.11]Signed.
[295:06.75]Sinister Shadows in the Swamp.
[295:10.12]Two players, no password, doesn't matter.
[295:14.96]Uh-huh.
[295:16.74]Alright.
[295:17.79]Are you ready?
[295:20.93]Quest accepted.
[295:24.39]Although I do need to put some items on my bar.
[295:29.65]Manage items.
[295:30.47]Put it on here.
[295:30.99]We've got potions.
[295:32.19]Let's fill that out.
[295:37.54]Uh...
[295:39.75]We're not trapping anything.
[295:47.57]You can just hit R2.
[295:49.81]That is a thousand times better.
[295:52.05]And you can pull it back.
[295:56.45]Wow, that's... Why did I not know that was a possibility?
[295:59.48]What a dummy.
[296:02.42]Okay, we got rations.
[296:05.82]Ten of those are fine.
[296:08.22]I feel like I should be using some of these other things, but that's all good.
[296:13.72]Alright.
[296:14.04]Is Alex here?
[296:15.66]You here, dude?
[296:17.91]Uh-oh.
[296:20.47]This might be one of those scenarios where we have to do it by ourselves first.
[296:27.11]You don't know what weapon you want to main in this game.
[296:28.60]I want to play everything.
[296:30.42]So before you... The one thing that's really great about Monster Hunter, and I'm not sure this was even in the last one, or the one that I played a long time ago, you could just go to the training grounds and use every weapon in the game.
[296:44.52]And it tells you some basic combos.
[296:47.22]You can just sit there and do it for like an hour and figure it out.
[296:49.58]That's kind of what me and Etalyx did.
[296:51.46]Yes.
[296:52.03]What mission?
[296:52.77]Posted a quest?
[296:54.07]I posted a quest.
[296:54.83]Okay.
[296:55.85]I don't believe we can... We probably have to do this alone and then come back and do it again because it says party members one out of one, do you see sinister shadows in the shadows in the swamp?
[297:05.15]You cannot join this quest because you have not progressed enough in the story.
[297:08.32]So I'm just going to go.
[297:09.26]I suggest you do it too.
[297:11.02]We know the drill.
[297:11.74]Okay.
[297:13.20]Okay.
[297:15.52]sure this is the first game of the training room well it was a great addition you don't really have to stick to a main weapon no you don't it's it's fun to bounce around but there because there are 14 different move sets right in the game with extra added moves as well okay it's fun to also be like yeah that's me that's my character I'm the sword guy
[297:45.03]Okay, so I don't... Can I put up like an SOS or something?
[297:49.23]Because now I'm on find the missing scholar.
[297:58.38]Are you also on this?
[298:04.01]I think he's no longer with us.
[298:05.51]I think he disappeared.
[298:10.91]Let's whetstone this up.
[298:17.14]I think it was already done, but I'm a creature of habit sometimes.
[298:25.08]Alright, find the missing scholar.
[298:31.64]Alright, I finally loaded in.
[298:33.26]I'm going to be a little behind you.
[298:38.47]Can we just SOS here?
[298:39.47]It looks like, oh, find the missing guy.
[298:40.99]Is an SOS possible?
[298:44.89]It's potential, I think, as long as we're in the same part now.
[298:47.93]Complete the assignment, find the scholar, maybe, right?
[298:50.41]Oh, no, I think I just signaled for random players.
[298:52.53]Uh-oh.
[298:54.49]Alright, how do you do an SOS?
[298:56.01]That would be pretty fun.
[298:56.87]Fire, it will be available after the cutscene, so no.
[298:59.93]It is not available yet.
[299:01.39]Oh, I think signal, like, pulses you on the map.
[299:03.51]Never mind.
[299:04.59]Alright.
[299:05.43]Where do I have to go here?
[299:09.59]I wasn't, like, paying attention right there.
[299:11.84]Usually the little flies tell you where to go, right?
[299:15.24]Um... I don't... I don't know.
[299:19.64]I think we just have to find the dude.
[299:20.76]Footprints and shit.
[299:24.89]Yeah, yeah.
[299:26.27]Yeah, it's like... You gotta, like, find the guy's footprints.
[299:29.73]She goes...
[299:32.10]Looks like I'm on the right track.
[299:37.62]More footprints.
[299:42.28]Where's the scholar?
[299:43.52]He's down here.
[299:45.67]Come on, man.
[299:46.99]Found him.
[299:50.33]No.
[299:54.01]What's going on?
[299:57.53]Something's wrong with the scouters.
[300:01.52]Dragon Ball Z?
[300:01.94]You know, I knew you were going to say that.
[300:05.16]Well, you're the one that said the scouters.
[300:07.44]Next thing I know, you're going to be saying some kind of like, it's over 7,000.
[300:10.96]I can hear your PS4 fans.
[300:13.48]Yeah, it's not a PS4 Pro.
[300:14.92]It can't handle it.
[300:18.51]It's having lots of trouble.
[300:22.45]There's a scholar book.
[300:25.03]There hasn't been that much slowdown beyond the 30 FPS, I don't think.
[300:29.03]Yeah, it's been okay.
[300:32.27]not that I've noticed anyway well I can tell you for just it's in the time I've played this game so far this one is way way better than the one I played on Monster Hunter Wii U yeah I uh because I mean you're gonna upset people but it's just true
[300:53.11]It's kind of the same way I feel about Dark Souls 3 and Bloodborne versus Dark Souls 2.
[300:59.15]It's just... They were great games at the time.
[301:01.30]But it's just a better video game.
[301:03.40]The graphics are better.
[301:04.34]The animations are better.
[301:06.08]Everything is... And that goes a long way.
[301:09.28]It does.
[301:09.84]Just fluid animations and not like... It's kind of clunky.
[301:14.19]And kind of leading you into it a little bit more...
[301:17.91]Not expecting you to Wikipedia everything.
[301:20.31]I don't know, though.
[301:21.69]The one thing I don't necessarily like about this game, I don't think I like the hair just go in this direction, flies tell you everything.
[301:29.84]I'm not sure I'm a big fan of that.
[301:32.96]Maybe, yeah.
[301:34.58]Because I feel like it's too forgiving.
[301:36.48]Maybe if it happened once every five to ten minutes or something.
[301:40.38]I bet you there's a way to turn it off if you really wanted to.
[301:44.59]I wouldn't be surprised if that was like a gameplay option.
[301:48.91]Maybe.
[301:52.81]I found the guy.
[301:56.25]So this is... I found the guy.
[301:57.97]Here comes the fight against the monster here, probably.
[302:00.25]You can turn off the flies.
[302:05.52]It's one of those odd situations, though, where I'm like... You get used to it.
[302:08.96]You kind of have to have it, almost.
[302:10.48]Kind of.
[302:11.22]And it's unfortunate to hear it out loud, we say.
[302:17.98]They're a little distracting, too.
[302:19.84]They kind of get in the way.
[302:21.86]They're like big particles.
[302:23.40]Maybe we should just turn them off and just be fucking pros.
[302:26.04]You know what I mean?
[302:26.70]We could.
[302:27.16]I mean, that would be a real way to do it.
[302:28.98]It would make it a lot harder, but... I wonder if there's... How would you find the... Via the tracks at that point?
[302:36.33]Would you just have to know where they... Where they spawn?
[302:39.93]Your armor looks dumb.
[302:42.61]Yeah, that's because I'm the fucking walnut organ.
[302:45.77]Apparently we are both experiencing this cutscene simultaneously.
[302:48.69]Alright, would you like me to join you or would you like to join me?
[302:52.41]Well, either way, one of us is going to be screwed because... Yes, I am proceeding with caution.
[303:00.30]You pick.
[303:01.46]What do you want to do?
[303:02.74]You fire the flare, I'll join you.
[303:04.44]Okay, I was just going to offer the reverse, but... Alright, I'm already in the menu!
[303:11.82]Do I have to back out to join you or no?
[303:15.60]I think you might.
[303:16.52]We'll see.
[303:16.86]But I need to get in a position where it's actually going to be kind of hard to do.
[303:27.98]What?
[303:30.19]Somebody just called my guy the spare rib.
[303:34.03]My fucking spare rib.
[303:36.73]Yeah, I'm just a really big fan of the McDonald's McRib.
[303:39.59]So I modeled my clothes.
[303:41.81]I'm trying to do it.
[303:42.89]It's hard to do when you're in the middle of a fight.
[303:44.61]Look, I'm here.
[303:45.89]If you just go off the waterfall a little bit.
[303:48.23]It's in the air.
[303:49.13]How did we do this before?
[303:51.97]I have to back out, I think, if you join on your... I believe you do.
[303:54.89]It's only the unfortunate stupid thing with these in-between cutscene expedition things.
[304:01.67]So I just have to not die.
[304:05.18]Yeah, sooner or later, I don't even care if this is the worst armor in the game for my character.
[304:11.16]I'm gonna turn into the entire McDonald's McRib.
[304:13.78]That's my goal.
[304:16.34]Well, I might as well try to do anything to him.
[304:18.05]Let's just fight him a little.
[304:20.57]I'm just gonna be dodging.
[304:23.73]I'm just getting used to him.
[304:24.99]Hey, well, I'm thinking of it as a challenge for you.
[304:32.40]because I'm only going to do like 16 damage to him total just to make it so I have an entertaining stream.
[304:37.56]You know, I don't want to have... I don't want to have... I don't want to have a not entertaining stream where I sit in an item box for 40 minutes at a time.
[304:47.76]Like, come on!
[304:49.62]I don't want to have that stream.
[304:51.22]Hey, at least you're not the loading bar.
[304:55.03]You want to be the loading bar guy?
[304:59.41]See, I've only done like 12, 14 damage.
[305:02.82]I do want to get rid of these other fish people.
[305:08.61]Join request settings.
[305:09.77]Here he comes.
[305:11.59]Slowly.
[305:12.39]Here comes the shark man from Beautiful Joe.
[305:16.87]By the way, what a fantastic game.
[305:20.43]Let's get Beautiful Joe, Beautiful Joe 2.
[305:21.68]Those games are so good.
[305:23.74]Oh, Beautiful Joe?
[305:24.76]Yeah.
[305:26.67]Maybe I'll, like, play those on stream one day.
[305:28.19]I love those games.
[305:28.65]Didn't they make that, like... They went from that to some kind of Hot Wheels game, didn't they?
[305:34.89]I mean, that's Platinum, isn't it?
[305:38.60]Is it?
[305:39.04]I think so.
[305:40.66]It might be crazy, but I'm pretty sure that's Platinum.
[305:45.02]I don't think it was Platinum.
[305:45.96]Am I insane?
[305:49.26]Who made... Beautiful Joe... Dev...
[305:58.67]Developed by the design staff of Team Beautiful.
[306:03.93]Okami?
[306:04.37]Why am I thinking... Capcom Production Studio 4.
[306:07.57]Clover.
[306:07.91]Clover.
[306:08.25]That's okay.
[306:08.75]It was Clover.
[306:10.27]And then Clover became Platinum.
[306:12.07]Okay.
[306:12.61]Yeah.
[306:13.13]I knew it was something like that.
[306:14.35]Okay.
[306:14.47]By the way, I'm gonna... Hopefully I don't waste one of our lives here.
[306:19.03]I just got here.
[306:21.85]And I will run over to you.
[306:23.81]I've had to do one potion.
[306:25.02]That's it so far.
[306:26.02]So I'm okay.
[306:29.20]I have very pointy french fry weapons.
[306:32.12]Kinda.
[306:35.22]And... stab.
[306:36.42]Alright, let's clear out... I'm gonna clear out these stupid shark enemies right now.
[306:42.93]We have to track him.
[306:44.37]He's currently running away.
[306:45.27]I wonder if there was a closer camp I could have teleported to.
[306:50.53]Oh well.
[306:51.27]I'm here.
[306:51.61]Well, more or less.
[306:53.83]Hunt the... Jura... Jura... Juri... Jerk?
[306:58.86]Jura... Jura... Jura Totus.
[307:01.72]The Jura Totus.
[307:03.72]Gerudo?
[307:04.12]Yeah, I think he ran by you.
[307:08.83]Alright, I made it.
[307:09.69]Alright.
[307:11.51]Is he away from the swamp?
[307:12.55]This actually might be a good thing.
[307:14.05]He's just flipping over and over again.
[307:16.08]Alright, engage the enemy.
[307:19.41]Would I recommend this game to somebody that's never played a Monster Hunter before?
[307:21.97]I would say this is absolutely the most accessible Monster Hunter I've come across.
[307:25.55]Off to a great start.
[307:29.61]Okay.
[307:30.33]Here we go.
[307:30.93]Let's fight.
[307:34.11]First, let me sharpen my stuff.
[307:36.56]You have fun.
[307:38.70]You have fun?
[307:39.48]Of course.
[307:39.86]I say that.
[307:42.74]It comes right for you.
[307:45.50]Oh, wow.
[307:49.62]Just let me sharpen, please.
[307:54.66]Oh my god.
[307:56.33]Are you really going to do me like that?
[308:00.03]Just sharpen the damn thing.
[308:03.19]Sharpen it.
[308:03.85]He's got like... I think his fins are the most... Okay, finally.
[308:10.71]His fins.
[308:12.01]I got rejected.
[308:13.27]I think his tail is bad.
[308:14.53]His tail button is... Ooh.
[308:22.11]My god, what a fucking waste.
[308:24.13]Alright, my turn for potion.
[308:27.49]I'm gonna die.
[308:27.85]I need to get a mega potion on here.
[308:29.95]Man, my bug is super ineffective because he like goes underwater.
[308:38.78]Give me a fucking break.
[308:40.68]I swear to god.
[308:42.18]Every time.
[308:44.34]Can I please?
[308:50.00]Where am I?
[308:55.40]It's not working so well.
[308:57.12]You're almost dead.
[308:57.98]No.
[308:58.12]Never mind.
[308:58.76]You're alright.
[308:59.10]I was looking at a different health meter.
[309:04.20]Where'd he go?
[309:04.66]He's over here.
[309:05.24]Great.
[309:05.38]I'm glad I used my demon blades.
[309:07.52]This is stamina.
[309:18.49]God.
[309:18.69]Watch out.
[309:18.95]Don't let him fucking go into the water and launch you up.
[309:21.17]He's going to play popcorn like he's on a trampoline with you.
[309:27.57]Oh yeah, the tail is the vulnerable part.
[309:40.92]God damn it!
[309:43.82]What were you doing?
[309:44.79]Trying to heal.
[309:46.11]Oh.
[309:46.89]Whoops.
[309:50.15]Stop diving!
[310:00.25]What's he doing?
[310:05.37]Ow, eating me.
[310:13.25]Yeah, that's what I wanted.
[310:14.37]I got a few hits in.
[310:18.70]Just a few.
[310:19.28]It's kind of hard to control.
[310:34.31]Feeling good about that one.
[310:35.03]Watch it.
[310:35.87]Alright, need a whetstone.
[310:47.45]Got to sharpen up.
[310:48.28]Back it up.
[310:50.14]No, turn it off.
[310:53.34]Ah!
[310:54.82]Sticky mud.
[310:55.64]Come on, bug.
[310:57.32]Go do your thing.
[310:57.94]What's he doing?
[310:59.02]Oh, he's being annoying.
[311:04.28]Maybe we might be hurting him.
[311:05.80]He looks like he's trying to swim away.
[311:07.64]He is trying to get away.
[311:12.65]After.
[311:12.79]There was a material back there, unfortunately.
[311:14.47]Uh, material from him?
[311:18.43]Yeah.
[311:19.23]Well, then shouldn't we go get that?
[311:20.51]Nah, it's too late.
[311:21.73]We can just catch up to him.
[311:23.00]We're hunters, you know?
[311:24.32]What are we here for?
[311:25.00]The body parts.
[311:26.32]You know what?
[311:26.66]You're right.
[311:29.88]Dreamer fights the air.
[311:31.86]Well, that's just the way these weapons work.
[311:34.40]And plus, this is only the first time I've ever used melee so far at Monster Hunter: World.
[311:39.55]Why do we have to fight this thing now?
[311:41.93]I think he ignores you.
[311:43.31]Alright, well, he's currently... Alright, where's the material?
[311:47.67]It's right here.
[311:49.55]I don't know.
[311:49.95]Is this here for you too, or no?
[311:55.22]I see you picking something up.
[311:57.56]I may have just taken it.
[312:01.63]I guess.
[312:02.27]Did you steal mine?
[312:03.53]There was only one.
[312:06.37]Well, I don't know what it was.
[312:08.35]We have to find it.
[312:09.37]Let's get away from this dude.
[312:10.41]I guess he's following you.
[312:13.50]Is he?
[312:14.28]The Baron is currently following you.
[312:15.98]I hope he's not hostile.
[312:21.04]No, he's not.
[312:29.70]Okay, the fish is just currently sitting around.
[312:34.18]I'm gonna whetstone before we go in there.
[312:38.68]Etalyx looks like Etalyx.
[312:39.88]Yeah, he does.
[312:41.46]He very much is Etalyx.
[312:42.39]Alright, I'm here.
[312:43.57]I found the guy.
[312:45.45]This is him.
[312:45.95]Okay, let's do it.
[312:51.91]Stupid swamp.
[312:55.31]I don't know how that hit me, but okay.
[312:57.77]Okay.
[313:00.75]No, don't do that to me.
[313:02.19]Wherever he is, don't do it.
[313:03.91]Woohoo, that was close.
[313:17.46]Back it up.
[313:18.76]Currently exhausted from this.
[313:29.24]Bye.
[313:30.21]Bye.
[313:30.49]Alright, get the poison.
[313:33.55]Get the health steal.
[313:35.95]No, not on me.
[313:37.27]Not on me.
[313:37.75]Not on me.
[313:38.09]Not on me.
[313:38.49]Not on me, please.
[313:42.58]Eat it.
[313:43.96]There we go.
[313:44.64]Insane.
[313:59.25]Broke another part.
[314:00.17]We're getting there.
[314:05.93]Ow.
[314:06.17]Alright, where's my health steal?
[314:10.60]Oh, wow.
[314:12.34]What was that?
[314:13.12]That was his anger boot.
[314:14.94]He's going to hide with the fish.
[314:19.42]Hide with the crocodiles.
[314:20.48]They're fine.
[314:22.18]They're friendly.
[314:25.69]No, he's going to pop.
[314:29.05]I'm almost dead.
[314:29.73]I am almost dead.
[314:31.17]Red alert.
[314:39.55]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[314:40.61]Get away, get away, get away.
[314:42.87]That was close.
[314:45.39]Don't spit.
[314:49.67]Oh, he's getting eaten by the little alligators when he just went by.
[314:53.15]Yeah, they're like going after him.
[314:54.80]Alright, just one, two, three, four, five, good.
[315:00.07]Sharp, we're sharp again.
[315:02.67]We've increased our sharpness.
[315:03.91]Oh yeah, I need to do that too.
[315:09.61]Good call, good call.
[315:13.07]I think he's going for me though.
[315:15.91]Where am I?
[315:16.49]Uh-oh, please don't, please don't do me.
[315:20.38]Oh no, he's doing me.
[315:21.00]He's coming for you.
[315:31.32]Alright, we're good.
[315:31.96]We're good.
[315:33.50]Oh, what's the tail swipe with there, man?
[315:35.37]Come on.
[315:43.75]What's with this tail swipe action?
[315:48.29]Apparently saw it coming.
[315:54.68]Oh, come on.
[315:55.84]I can't get in close.
[316:02.93]I think there's another material over there.
[316:05.85]Another one?
[316:06.59]How do you keep finding these?
[316:09.82]Are they shiny or something?
[316:11.48]I keep walking over them on the ground.
[316:13.64]Alright, here we go.
[316:18.00]Here we go.
[316:21.96]Only doing one damage per attack, but that's okay.
[316:24.58]I mounted the monster.
[316:30.97]More spins, more spins, more spins.
[316:39.08]That worked out pretty well.
[316:46.10]On the neck.
[316:49.52]We're in his territory right now.
[316:51.78]Sludging around.
[316:54.22]Where's he going?
[316:55.12]Is he running?
[316:55.66]I think he's running away.
[316:56.32]Alright.
[316:57.86]He's got to be on the ropes now.
[316:58.88]I think so.
[317:01.52]Am I playing as a Beyblade?
[317:06.54]Kind of.
[317:07.12]I think we both are, kind of.
[317:13.06]Scoop up some of that sticky mud.
[317:16.07]Are you playing currently as a Beyblade?
[317:20.45]We're both playing as the spin-to-win class.
[317:22.65]Oh, get up there.
[317:30.65]Macho- I don't like- I almost just accidentally started attacking him.
[317:34.89]That would've been bad.
[317:42.92]This fish had better make you good pants.
[317:46.28]I hope it does.
[317:46.82]I'm out of breath.
[317:52.04]Really?
[318:03.51]Chop, chop, chop.
[318:06.81]I didn't think you were coming from me.
[318:10.22]Maybe I was.
[318:17.90]Oh, you messed up my combo.
[318:20.68]Alright, I didn't get my sharpen all the way down.
[318:24.02]You're almost dead now.
[318:24.89]I didn't have a chance to even get up.
[318:28.85]And now I'm almost dead.
[318:29.99]So, uh... I'm dead.
[318:33.37]I am full dead.
[318:34.23]Whoa, whoa, you're full dead.
[318:35.67]You're full dead.
[318:36.13]That means we got two continues.
[318:37.87]I kind of got cheesed, actually.
[318:41.60]I got knocked down.
[318:43.22]And as soon as I got up, he hit me again.
[318:48.14]I'm still engaging.
[319:01.46]And where's he going?
[319:03.20]I don't know.
[319:03.76]Over there.
[319:08.04]You shouldn't be that far away, actually.
[319:14.73]Dodge.
[319:15.05]Yeah.
[319:15.97]I guess dying, you just get fewer rewards for the mission.
[319:20.39]But you can repeat these missions afterward anyway.
[319:25.53]That's good.
[319:25.93]I wonder if this tail didn't have too big a deal.
[319:28.59]Are you running again?
[319:32.05]Oh no.
[319:34.81]I thought I was gonna be able to get a few on the head there.
[319:37.07]I'm doing like a narrow tail run.
[319:56.64]Not sure how to get my... Is that you healing?
[320:10.58]I think my bug tries to... Oh, not this again.
[320:12.78]It's like the same spot.
[320:18.17]Yeah, my little bug tries to heal me.
[320:20.27]Sometimes it works.
[320:27.96]Spin!
[320:29.75]Spin wildly, my friend.
[320:31.35]Alright, I gotta get out of there.
[320:39.91]I was about to just lose my mind.
[320:41.06]Mm-hmm.
[320:50.28]Come here!
[320:50.70]Yes!
[320:50.96]See you!
[320:51.78]Yep.
[320:52.48]Let's go down here.
[320:55.03]Whoo!
[320:55.27]Alright.
[321:02.41]This animation takes a long time to fucking end.
[321:14.19]Did you break something off?
[321:15.11]Looks like you broke something.
[321:16.17]I don't think so.
[321:16.79]Where are you going?
[321:32.27]I think we got him on the ropes, though.
[321:37.71]I keep thinking of the Beyblade thing.
[321:43.69]Those are some jumps.
[321:46.09]What the... Whetstone?
[321:48.63]Yeah.
[321:48.97]Why is this the perfect place to Whetstone?
[321:50.77]Like, right on top of this little ridge.
[321:52.93]It really is.
[321:53.99]It's a fantastic place.
[321:55.13]I think he's close.
[321:56.09]He's back in his home.
[321:58.40]He's in the corner back there.
[322:01.18]That's where he heals.
[322:01.88]We gotta get over there.
[322:03.72]Is that where he heals?
[322:04.74]Yeah, if he starts to rest and lick his wounds and sleep, he gets health.
[322:10.75]Alright, let's sneak up.
[322:11.41]Let's make everybody sneak up on him.
[322:12.71]Sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak.
[322:20.35]I'm helping!
[322:21.41]I'm helping!
[322:22.05]Oh, come on!
[322:25.25]What are you doing?
[322:26.93]Like, some of these dual blade animations take, like, a full two and a half seconds.
[322:32.97]Is his tail, like, different?
[322:35.26]I don't know, I feel like I'm getting the most damage on his tail.
[322:40.86]Yeah, that's where the...
[322:47.38]Is this tail even there anymore?
[322:49.08]Have we cut the tail?
[322:49.76]No, that's just a fucking dumb fish.
[322:52.28]Alright, back on him.
[322:58.81]I'm gonna go back to this tail.
[323:04.35]That's where I would like to stay.
[323:05.45]I'm riding him.
[323:07.71]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[323:09.61]Why are you guys being so mean to this poor creature?
[323:11.67]I don't know.
[323:12.03]Because we're just terrible people.
[323:16.56]And all we care about is like money.
[323:20.19]You like cut their legs off and shit and it gives you money.
[323:24.15]We are the African elephant hunters.
[323:27.81]These are the rare endangered creatures, poor souls.
[323:32.96]I need to get to safety so I can... I love how that animation takes a long time.
[323:40.52]So if you're just wildly swinging, it's just like... Oh!
[323:46.33]I keep getting knocked around.
[323:54.38]I love it so much.
[323:56.14]Oh, come on!
[323:58.66]Why are you still alive?
[324:00.08]Because I just keep... I don't know.
[324:02.51]I keep healing to full health.
[324:06.02]Alright, I'm back.
[324:07.62]I need to wait for Whetstone.
[324:16.87]Are we doing something wrong on this boss?
[324:19.23]I was just trying to fucking get ready.
[324:22.17]I was just trying to get ready.
[324:24.43]I slapped my face.
[324:27.41]Why would I do this part here?
[324:28.96]And this is gonna work too.
[324:30.86]Of course it is.
[324:32.64]Not when I go all the way across the map to fucking do it.
[325:05.26]I like the dual welding, but it does just feel like... I feel like I could do as good of a job as this hero is doing.
[325:15.40]How is that?
[325:15.88]By just swinging my hands wildly and spinning around in a circle.
[325:24.67]We did it!
[325:26.35]Calm down, he's already dead.
[325:28.19]The Beyblade, this guy's gonna stick with me for a long time.
[325:32.24]I'll never forget that.
[325:34.58]Why you have Beyblade?
[325:40.42]It's cool, like, slash, slash, slash, but once you start doing shit like this... Like, the combo, this is fucking awesome.
[325:52.02]But like, watch, ready?
[325:52.90]Like this.
[325:55.64]That shit is cool, but it's hard to even tell what the fuck just happened.
[325:59.87]That looks pretty sweet, not gonna lie.
[326:05.73]Way too much Beyblade.
[326:07.77]Oh, man.
[326:09.75]Look at this screenshot.
[326:12.89]I am above him.
[326:14.29]Like, I'm flipping over his back in my screenshot.
[326:17.57]Yeah, and I'm just swinging around in a circle.
[326:21.50]Aqua sacs.
[326:23.78]Scales and armor spheres.
[326:28.33]You guys are fucking hilarious.
[326:32.01]Oh, that was cool.
[326:32.79]Alright, so, I mean... What?
[326:34.69]The McRib Beyblade.
[326:38.31]Five and a half hours.
[326:39.89]What's that?
[326:40.23]Our, like, fifth monster?
[326:42.10]That's pretty good, I think.
[326:44.58]I think we did alright.
[326:47.02]I wish the screenshot was me just swinging at the air.
[326:51.46]Yeah, I think we did okay.
[326:55.65]This has been, like, eight hours of...
[326:59.35]Monster Hunter: World for me today because I started playing at like noon and now it's 11 p.m.
[327:04.87]It's actually like 10 hours.
[327:07.18]Yeah, this is fun.
[327:10.48]I'm not sure how much fun it is to watch this game, but it's definitely very fun to play this game.
[327:20.72]But with that, I think that's where I'm going to call it a night.
[327:26.40]Yeah, sounds like a good plan.
[327:30.51]uh so Etalyx always a pleasure it was fun it was a fun game there was a little bit of frustration there and we I I did there was a little bit but it was only one monster that was frustrating but it was it's alright sometimes you have frustrating moments yeah once we figured out how to party properly that was I mean we kind of knew how already but extra loading screen or two oh well no it's not good no big deal
[327:55.84]No, in the grand scheme of things, six and a half out of ten.
[328:00.78]No, I'm kidding.
[328:03.60]That makes Monster Hunter 3 Wii U like a four out of ten.
[328:06.74]Well, Monster Hunter Wii U was a two.
[328:08.85]You can't tell people that.
[328:10.99]They'll make you walk naked through the streets.
[328:14.91]No, it was good.
[328:16.89]I'm very much enjoying myself in this game.
[328:19.15]I would put a stamp of recommend.
[328:22.49]Me and Metallix were kind of scared about console and FPS issues and frame rate.
[328:28.82]But after the first 20 minutes, I kind of just forgot it was even a thing.
[328:31.96]You kind of just get used to it.
[328:34.16]Kind of like Bloodborne.
[328:37.28]But, Etalyx, take care.
[328:39.00]Probably see you again soon.
[328:40.22]Yep, it was fun.
[328:41.38]Alright.
[328:42.72]Good night, Jerma's chat.
[328:44.41]Goodbye, Etalyx' chat.
[328:45.91]And goodbye.
[328:49.97]Alright, so... If you enjoyed that... I can't believe you're still playing, but I'm very happy you are.
[328:59.54]It's good.
[329:00.30]I liked the other Monster Hunter.
[329:02.06]It's not like I didn't like it.
[329:04.58]When we... I don't know what that was.
[329:06.74]I played Monster Hunter 3, right?
[329:08.84]What was it?
[329:09.14]Monster Hunter Wii U Ultimate or something?
[329:12.80]I played that game for a couple of weeks on stream.
[329:18.93]I think what's going to happen is... I'm probably not going to do this on any more scheduled streams.
[329:27.07]But... I think...
[329:30.94]I think we'll just maybe pick off where we left off again tomorrow.
[329:36.28]Maybe I'll do... Because I can feel myself actually getting fairly interested in the game.
[329:42.53]So... If you want to see it, if you think it's still interesting to watch, then I'll probably be streaming it tomorrow too.
[329:49.21]On an off day.
[329:52.33]So for your regularly scheduled programming for Jerma985 twitch.tv Twitch channel.
[330:00.61]On Tuesday, I'm going to try to do... We've got a lot of things that are coming up here.
[330:07.22]Here's what you can expect.
[330:09.21]Tuesday, I'm gonna try to get it ready.
[330:11.33]And if I can't get it ready, I'm gonna do it later.
[330:14.03]But I want to do some light gun stuff on Tuesday.
[330:18.23]So expect, hopefully, if I can get everything set up and everything ready.
[330:21.99]Because it's gonna be a pain in the ass to capture that and set up like a monitor and a TV and the webcam over my shoulder shooting.
[330:28.44]We're gonna do the whole nine.
[330:29.98]So expect like time crisis, point blank.
[330:33.28]We're gonna do like a week of light gun games.
[330:35.62]I think that'd be a lot of fun.
[330:39.09]If we can't get that, if I can't get it to work, then I have to push that forward and maybe we can start Dreamcast.
[330:45.87]And if we don't start Dreamcast, then it might be to push that forward because that's another whole story on its own.
[330:53.03]True Crime Streets of New York, whatever it is, True Crime New York is the other thing that is ready to pretty much go.
[331:00.58]And then Meme Funeral is February 1st because then you get one month of the memes.
[331:05.80]Thanks for sticking around, everybody.
[331:06.86]This is a long stream.
[331:09.62]I wasn't expecting a large turnout on this stream.
[331:15.30]But I was actually pretty surprised at how many people were here for most of it.
[331:20.60]Thank you so much for sticking around.
[331:22.44]If you're new to the channel, hi.
[331:24.76]Hopefully you enjoyed the stream.
[331:27.32]If not, then fuck!
[331:31.32]I probably just scared somebody, and I'm sorry for that.
[331:35.59]But let's wrap up the last few bits with these kind of more chill streams It's a lot easier for me to keep up with the bits and stuff just because You know, it's like a five and a half hour stream and I don't get like really locked in There's a lot of downtime with the menus and stuff.
[331:53.93]So
[331:57.96]Thank you to Grizzly1620.
[331:59.72]1620, thanks for the $1.
[332:02.16]It's been a fun stream tonight.
[332:03.04]It's time for me to crawl into a ball and cry at the fact that I ate McDonald's.
[332:07.37]I was going to buy 60 McNuggets, but thankfully someone in the Discord talked me out of it.
[332:11.57]Anyways, I love you and hope you don't have sweet dreams tonight.
[332:14.87]I hope you do.
[332:15.43]Wait, I read that wrong.
[332:16.97]I hope your dreams are fucking awful, Jeremy.
[332:20.29]Thanks, Grizzly.
[332:22.03]Sroylet, Sroylet, Sroylet, thanks to you, thanks Sroylet1 for the $100 and $99.99.

[333:00.52]That's so awful.
[333:01.74]But it just feels so right, doesn't it?
[333:04.36]When you have the fresh pizza box, you open up like a medium pizza, there's like seven or eight slices there.
[333:09.45]They're all for you.
[333:10.35]You don't have to share slices.
[333:12.37]You don't have to get down to the last one and start counting.
[333:15.01]How many have you had?
[333:16.21]You have two?
[333:16.69]You have one?
[333:17.99]I have two.
[333:18.65]You have three?
[333:19.39]Alright, I have three, so you have two.
[333:21.11]No, just you get the whole damn thing to yourself.
[333:22.71]No, you don't have to have any people around you, like hawking you for slices and shit.
[333:30.38]I envy that.
[333:34.46]But, again, thank you to Srollat.
[333:38.00]I'm going to call you Sroll.
