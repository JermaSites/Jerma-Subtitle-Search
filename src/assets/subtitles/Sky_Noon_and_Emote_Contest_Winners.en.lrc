[00:02.43]first there was darkness and then god said light be in you and he turned on the fan to cool himself down hi and we also had this funny little music what what's playing right now
[00:34.11]Is there audio playing right now?
[00:36.01]For some reason?
[00:37.27]No.
[00:38.13]Hi.
[00:39.69]Uh, so... How you doing, first of all?
[00:43.91]No, I gotta get out of here.
[00:44.71]I'll be back... Like, we gotta wait till at least 15 people click on the stream.
[00:48.07]I'll be right back.
[02:04.74]Let me go over what we're doing tonight.
[02:06.78]Or today.
[02:08.68]It's technically evening, right?
[02:12.22]So here's what's going to happen.
[02:14.66]First of all, we're going to play this game called Sky Noon.
[02:22.06]Yeah, there are 15 people.
[02:24.52]Sky Noon is a...
[02:27.32]First-person shooter, western-themed, Smash Brothers, knock the guy off the, no damage, you gotta knock the guy off the zone game.
[02:37.37]I literally saw this less than four hours ago, five hours ago, and I was totally, why am I not gonna play this game?
[02:46.92]It looks really fun.
[02:48.42]Now that could change, this could be awful.
[02:50.88]But that's the game we're gonna play today.
[02:52.81]And also, after about an hour or two, we're going to go over the emote results.
[02:58.53]I got a whole thing set up over here.
[02:59.79]I'm gonna show it on screen.
[03:01.64]We're gonna talk about the percentages.
[03:03.06]We're gonna talk about math.
[03:07.40]So, can we do the emotes now?
[03:08.89]No.
[03:10.31]Because it takes about 45 minutes to an hour for most people to join and stay.
[03:19.63]So right now there's, you know, I just turned the stream on.
[03:22.32]I don't want anyone to miss it if they didn't want to miss it today.
[03:26.82]So it takes about an hour.
[03:28.02]But with that being said, give me one more minute.
[03:31.22]I want to go chug a yogurt.
[03:34.29]So I'll be right fucking back, dudes.
[03:36.19]Give me one second.
[04:14.45]What?
[04:47.20]Okay.
[04:48.38]Yeah, my stomach's doing that thing where it sucks.
[04:51.74]And I can only drink yogurt.
[04:55.52]Hey, it's fun!
[04:58.26]Nah, that's good.
[04:59.57]Alright, so, uh, can you hear the fan?
[05:01.71]I got a fan just kind of blowing here still.
[05:06.59]It's not picking up on the mic like crazy, right?
[05:10.57]I guess, man, here's a better indication.
[05:13.45]Better now?
[05:17.06]Nice.
[05:21.28]Yes.
[05:22.86]My ears.
[05:23.42]It's so loud.
[05:25.24]Well, look, I can't adjust it.
[05:26.51]It's got one setting.
[05:28.45]On.
[05:28.63]Alright, so let's play... Sky Noon.
[05:36.41]I'm actually excited to play this.
[05:38.45]Because, number one, I love Western-themed first-person shooters.
[05:42.22]Number two, I love Smash Bros.
[05:44.90]Number three...
[05:50.12]A cactus?
[05:50.82]I can't.
[05:51.44]I got nothing else.
[05:52.00]So let's go.
[05:55.02]Number three.
[05:55.46]I love Fortnite.
[05:56.38]So it's really similar.
[05:58.40]Let's go to practice.
[05:59.22]Tutorial.
[06:02.84]Press W-A-S-D to get the fuck out of here.
[06:06.98]Make sure this is running good.
[06:09.92]It's not.
[06:11.52]Uh-oh.
[06:14.26]It's a little clammy.
[06:16.25]This might be because it's getting streamed.
[06:17.85]Hold on.
[06:20.65]Hold on a second.
[06:21.17]It's a little clammy.
[06:27.01]That's a little better.
[06:30.12]Hold on.
[06:31.54]Hold on.
[06:34.14]I think I might have to turn off my FPS limiter.
[06:37.74]Let's just see if that does anything.
[06:46.52]It's okay.
[06:47.78]Hold spacebar to clamber over ledges.
[06:53.76]So, can I just... I guess you have to grab the wooden piece.
[07:02.35]You gotta grab the wood.
[07:04.97]It is parkour in this game.
[07:06.09]I love dying light.
[07:09.75]Okay, cool.
[07:13.42]Got our first weapon.
[07:15.08]Hold right mouse to grapple.
[07:18.46]Yep.
[07:19.67]Ah, yep, that's fucking fun.
[07:21.11]All right, the crosshair is green when the grappling hook is in range.
[07:28.03]Yeah, it's one of these games.
[07:32.23]Hold on, slow down, slow down, slow down.
[07:33.41]I don't wanna just fly around here.
[07:34.62]Okay, gotta get up there.
[07:37.24]Is it a wind blowing device?
[07:40.54]You can grab onto anything, by the way, and pull yourself up.
[07:43.78]Press E to throw your lasso.
[07:46.53]Hold on.
[07:46.83]Wait, wait, wait.
[07:47.19]I think I... Did I change that?
[07:48.35]I might have to change that.
[07:49.33]It's like middle mouse.
[07:50.13]Yeah, I'm gonna change that to middle mouse.
[07:55.27]Controls.
[07:56.27]Lasso.
[07:59.87]This is gonna be fun.
[08:02.70]This is gonna be fun.
[08:03.52]Okay, middle mouse.
[08:05.78]That sounds alright.
[08:06.56]Let's take a look.
[08:08.58]Middle mouse.
[08:12.30]So you can pull these.
[08:13.16]Oh, you can pull the carts.
[08:15.58]Oh, let me get up there.
[08:18.66]Oh, fuck.
[08:22.02]It takes a little getting used to.
[08:22.94]Alright, so pull this with the lasso.
[08:26.05]Oh, shit.
[08:26.65]Does that knock me off?
[08:28.35]This is the payload.
[08:30.21]You gotta get the payload to... Okay, the cart will respawn after it destroys a gate.
[08:34.97]Pull it in again.
[08:40.73]So I think you actually have to... This is one of the objectives.
[08:43.07]Press H for your current equipment.
[08:45.34]Grab a hook and lasso.
[08:47.53]Pull crates and enemies to you.
[08:49.28]Pull yourself to your destination.
[08:50.60]By the way, yes, those of you that are asking, you can grapple hook onto other players.
[08:56.96]Just in case you wanted to know about that little tidbit.
[09:00.30]I can't shoot this.
[09:02.14]Oh.
[09:02.90]Wait, wait, come back here.
[09:05.97]Weapons and abilities.
[09:06.73]Alright, let's go into weapons.
[09:10.49]What do we got?
[09:12.35]Left mouse button to fire.
[09:13.93]Fire the weapon.
[09:14.61]R to reload.
[09:17.55]So this is a rocket launcher.
[09:18.49]Hit track switches to redirect the cart.
[09:22.77]Okay, hold on.
[09:29.84]I feel like this is gonna be fun.
[09:31.04]Alright, let me check out the other weapons.
[09:35.92]That's the hand cannon.
[09:37.18]This is the revolver.
[09:38.10]This is just a single shot.
[09:45.73]Very accurate, it seems.
[09:49.78]I probably should look at the equipment.
[09:52.10]Okay, revolver.
[09:53.95]Just left mouse button fire.
[09:55.09]Any other info about it?
[09:57.75]Machine pistol?
[09:58.65]Oh, I like this.
[10:03.21]I like the little dart gun.
[10:11.26]That's really cool.
[10:11.88]It's like a little paintball gun.
[10:14.40]How many more weapons are there?
[10:17.20]Shotgun?
[10:20.05]That's a huge area.
[10:25.79]I feel like this is going to be very overpowered.
[10:27.11]Look at that fucking area.
[10:29.33]Alright, hold on.
[10:29.83]What about any others?
[10:31.89]The shotgun sounds bad.
[10:37.28]Well, here's the thing.
[10:38.22]People saying the sounds aren't that great.
[10:40.42]Think about it like this.
[10:41.92]There's no damage in this game.
[10:44.02]Right?
[10:45.04]You are actually shooting air.
[10:47.10]This is not a rocket launcher.
[10:49.38]Remember those stupid things you used to be able to buy at Spencer Gifts where you stood back and you pulled on the- it was a dome.
[10:54.70]It was a big dome cannon that was an air gun.
[10:57.34]And you stood back 500 feet from your friend and you pulled back and DUN!
[11:00.98]And you could get hit right in the face with the fucking air.
[11:04.66]That's what I see this as.
[11:07.84]Somebody has to- the airzooka, that's right.
[11:10.40]I used to be so good at the airzooka it's not even funny.
[11:13.39]My buddy could be down the hall in class.
[11:16.98]Like, all the way at the end of the hallway.
[11:18.80]We're talking like 600 feet.
[11:20.76]And all I had to do was pull back on the little paper mache back and... And it traveled so far.
[11:27.53]It took so long to get to its destination.
[11:30.07]So you would pull back on this thing and... One.
[11:34.01]Two.
[11:34.95]Three.
[11:35.63]It would hit you right in the face.
[11:36.71]It was... I'm gonna buy one.
[11:38.68]Can they still sell them?
[11:44.34]That shit was so much fun.
[11:47.71]Alright, so this is a... But anyways, it's air.
[11:52.15]So there's no actual weapons.
[11:54.59]You're shooting air.
[11:55.19]Alright, I think I know everything.
[11:58.17]I think I know everything!
[12:00.15]Let's check out this.
[12:02.47]This is... Just a shotgun.
[12:05.15]Alright, let's pull the cart back.
[12:07.78]Do I have to go get a new cart?
[12:08.70]I think I have to go get a new cart.
[12:13.75]Let's go get one.
[12:14.83]And I'm gonna punch this.
[12:16.67]And then go to abilities.
[12:17.55]Alright, so let's go down here.
[12:22.12]Get a new cart.
[12:24.80]Go, go, go!
[12:26.54]That's gonna go all the way up, right?
[12:30.30]Oh, shit!
[12:33.82]I got it.
[12:34.08]Now it's gonna go in here.
[12:38.96]I hear the fan now.
[12:40.03]No, see?
[12:40.65]It's air.
[12:41.49]That's what you're hearing.
[12:47.92]Boom.
[12:49.62]Alright, abilities.
[12:52.48]Spades, alright.
[12:55.08]Use your ability.
[12:56.04]Teleporter.
[12:59.28]Okay, so you get a tracer porter thing.
[13:00.98]That's interesting.
[13:05.25]So after two seconds it goes.
[13:07.27]Alright, what about this one?
[13:11.27]Booster?
[13:13.99]Boost forward.
[13:14.71]Collide with a surface to send enemies flying.
[13:20.89]Oh, fuck.
[13:22.77]Collide with the surface.
[13:23.59]Hold on, let me see.
[13:25.19]Can I go person bowling with myself?
[13:29.69]Let's try it.
[13:32.33]That's awesome.
[13:33.09]All right.
[13:35.13]Very interesting stuff.
[13:36.31]Let's get the last one just to see what it does.
[13:42.19]And jet boots.
[13:45.38]You can just fly.
[13:46.14]Hold space while flying to rise.
[13:47.86]Watch the fuel meter.
[13:53.97]Oh, alright.
[13:54.45]I don't know if I like that one very much.
[13:57.33]Seems kind of useful, but... Dynamite.
[13:59.83]This is just a dynamite stick.
[14:02.19]Cook dynamite, release the throw.
[14:04.91]Okay.
[14:06.13]That's a very, very short fuse.
[14:11.34]And it just launches you.
[14:13.10]I like this, though.
[14:13.84]You get three of them.
[14:15.88]Mines.
[14:18.18]Press it again to detonate.
[14:21.40]Cool.
[14:22.00]So you can kind of bait somebody behind you.
[14:23.86]And then try to knock them off.
[14:29.41]Dynamite.
[14:30.51]Mines.
[14:30.87]I think that's it.
[14:32.99]Alright, I think I'm ready to play.
[14:34.95]I'm ready to give it a try, at least.
[14:39.25]Let's do it.
[14:44.09]Oh, custom... Wait, wait, wait.
[14:45.54]Come on.
[14:47.24]It can be Jazz or Steve.
[14:49.64]Alright, let's be Steve.
[14:52.13]I have to unlock everything.
[14:53.65]Level 100?
[14:53.91]There's 100 levels in this game?
[15:01.61]That's all I can do.
[15:03.19]Okay, wait.
[15:03.79]Does it know... Because I have Discord installed?
[15:10.24]You know, you do have Discord.
[15:12.18]Alright, I'm gonna be the Discord guy.
[15:16.93]That's it?
[15:17.71]Can I put on more Discord stuff?
[15:20.33]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[15:23.13]okay all right uh let's uh let's do it quick join find server host game what about that just quick join I don't think there's very many people that play this right now so we're going to try to get in a game if we can looks like we're getting in one all right oh boy here we go this is just quick play all right well the game's over
[15:53.82]Game over.
[15:54.78]Remember, the whole goal here is not to kill anybody.
[16:01.60]You want to push him off the map.
[16:05.86]Oh, you're so bad.
[16:09.98]Yes, emote contest results are tonight.
[16:13.12]Just want to chill for a little bit so people can get in here and we'll go over it.
[16:17.64]I almost got to level 2 for that.
[16:21.22]Team elimination, King of the Hill.
[16:24.35]Let's do team elimination first, because I have no idea what's going on.
[16:31.87]There are currently seven players.
[16:37.83]How?
[16:40.32]Is it because it's early access?
[16:45.48]This game just came out, not even a month and a half ago.
[16:50.00]I could see this having a player base.
[16:53.55]Well, it depends.
[16:54.03]Let's see.
[16:54.31]So what do I got?
[16:57.65]Revolver and... Revolver and... That's the dash button.
[17:05.66]That's my teammate.
[17:06.32]So the people outlined in red.
[17:07.48]Like that guy over there.
[17:12.24]I got somebody.
[17:13.38]I don't know how.
[17:14.86]How did I lose?
[17:15.96]I got killed by something.
[17:20.08]What is this?
[17:20.54]Okay.
[17:28.38]Let's go this way.
[17:30.08]Alright, this is the machine gun.
[17:35.63]I gotta get up here.
[17:42.69]Oh, that's a teleporter.
[17:43.39]I thought it was a mine.
[17:44.53]That's my bad.
[17:45.11]No, I'm gonna keep this machine pistol.
[17:51.98]Is he dead?
[17:57.06]Oh, fuck.
[17:58.10]No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[18:00.08]No, that's a teleporter.
[18:01.72]No!
[18:02.58]I didn't even know what was happening.
[18:03.64]Ugh.
[18:07.12]It says Bioshock Infinite online.
[18:14.41]Oh, that's a shotgun.
[18:17.27]I want to try to get somebody with a shotgun.
[18:23.62]I'm going to grapple somebody.
[18:27.64]Like that.
[18:28.66]I got it.
[18:29.96]He's fucked.
[18:30.84]Goodbye.
[18:32.82]No, he came back.
[18:41.57]Got him.
[18:43.05]Oh, fuck.
[18:43.41]I'm gonna kill myself.
[18:44.67]Don't let go.
[18:46.21]Don't let go.
[18:46.65]I don't know what to do.
[18:47.77]Oh, shit.
[18:48.24]He hit me.
[18:54.60]No.
[18:55.70]I'm still in range.
[18:56.24]I'm good.
[19:03.10]Alright, you can't... So that actually is physics when you move around.
[19:08.10]I want to try it with this hand cannon.
[19:12.32]I could use my ability more, man.
[19:13.57]Seriously.
[19:13.99]I feel like air shots would be so good here.
[19:24.11]No, I didn't get him.
[19:25.65]Let's go up over here.
[19:32.44]So it's almost like they combined how cool LawBreakers looked on camera with Smash Bros.
[19:41.62]And then they added a little bit of western themed cereal into it.
[19:48.20]Remember how cool LawBreakers looked on video and then the game released?
[19:55.71]Where'd he go?
[20:02.53]Oh, fuck.
[20:03.07]No!
[20:03.77]I'm dead.
[20:04.21]No, I'm not.
[20:05.11]Boots.
[20:08.57]Ah!
[20:09.11]Damn it.
[20:09.51]At least we have somebody carrying the team.
[20:16.40]So you get a random loadout every time.
[20:18.10]You know what I'm gonna do?
[20:23.54]I gotta get my hand off the space bar.
[20:30.63]Yeah, it's just screwing me up.
[20:34.04]Shit.
[20:34.32]Come here.
[20:37.86]I want to try to boost this guy off.
[20:41.22]No, I don't want that.
[20:42.38]I want to keep the revolver.
[20:47.88]Yeah, alright.
[20:48.48]So you can... It's Spider-Man.
[20:49.88]You Spider-Man swing yourself around.
[20:51.40]Alright, let's try to fuck with this guy.
[21:02.81]Damn it.
[21:05.58]I'm gonna fall.
[21:07.20]So there are boosters on the bottoms of the level that try to push you down.
[21:10.32]I don't think there's any diminished returns or recoil really.
[21:29.71]Holy shit, that was fucking cool.
[21:37.84]It's all physics based.
[21:43.32]30 seconds.
[21:43.64]Get me out of there.
[21:53.89]Get in close to the shock and see if I can get one more person.
[21:56.11]Right here.
[21:57.71]Come on.
[21:58.75]Spin your head over here.
[21:59.53]Fuck.
[22:06.85]Nope.
[22:10.14]Oh, shit.
[22:14.07]There we go.
[22:14.87]Nice and easy.
[22:18.21]I get it.
[22:19.05]I'm starting to understand.
[22:26.51]Tiebreaker?
[22:27.10]Oh, the next person that falls off, we lose.
[22:28.58]No, we win.
[22:33.48]I only died twice.
[22:34.52]I did alright.
[22:36.74]It's my first real game.
[22:42.98]I wonder how many maps there are.
[22:49.66]There's only three people.
[22:50.72]What do you mean, worst on the team?
[22:52.56]What do you want me to do?
[22:55.40]I'm gonna level up here.
[22:56.86]See, level two.
[22:57.52]I get to wear the Discord t-shirt now.
[23:03.76]I didn't even get on the ending screen.
[23:08.14]This is a free-for-all.
[23:09.25]Let's try a free-for-all.
[23:16.87]New game equals I'm allowed to be bad?
[23:20.19]Well, alright, this is not just a new game.
[23:21.85]This is a new game with mechanics of the likes of which I've never seen.
[23:27.08]You too!
[23:31.24]You've never played Spider-Man 2?
[23:32.58]Alright, let's go.
[23:38.02]Alright, here we go.
[23:38.66]This is all just free-for-all.
[23:41.23]Let's see if I can't make something happen here.
[23:44.03]In fact, hold on.
[23:44.87]Settings.
[23:45.95]Control.
[23:46.99]Bring this down.
[23:47.85]My mouse is too high.
[23:49.12]Sensitivity is a little too high for me.
[23:52.50]Let's go.
[23:53.78]No, I had a good loadout.
[23:54.78]Why did you get rid of my loadout?
[23:58.16]Oh, fuck.
[24:04.59]That guy's in trouble.
[24:07.37]He's dead.
[24:08.15]See you later.
[24:14.21]Goodbye.
[24:15.83]Come on, why don't you come back?
[24:19.95]Ah, damn it.
[24:24.57]Oh shit, there's too many people over here.
[24:34.71]Got him.
[24:40.58]This booster is so good.
[24:44.50]Don't ever have any other weapon or item on your body.
[24:47.38]Only have the booster.
[24:53.24]Oh, fuck!
[24:54.43]I'm fine.
[24:56.43]Almost just blew it there, though.
[25:02.49]Oh, you dick!
[25:03.07]He just... Wow, that was a good shot.
[25:09.55]Let's try this.
[25:14.87]There's a range on... Oh my lord.
[25:18.41]One of the things that I've looked up is you want to try to back yourself into a wall.
[25:25.07]You don't want to just be standing in the open like I was.
[25:29.70]Let's get over there.
[25:33.44]Let's land.
[25:33.92]Somebody land.
[25:39.84]That was a good shot though.
[25:46.13]Trying to finish him off.
[25:46.93]I didn't even get the kill for that.
[25:47.89]I'm okay with this loadout.
[25:50.95]Oh, shit.
[26:03.60]This is so hard.
[26:04.54]This is a lot of fun, but this is a lot to do.
[26:17.98]Come on.
[26:19.16]Where is he?
[26:27.97]Wrap around.
[26:39.38]I can feel it.
[26:46.30]Let's go around this way.
[26:54.07]Okay.
[26:56.73]Oh, you're doing the same thing, aren't you?
[27:08.65]It's so much fun to do that, but my brain is not big enough for this game.
[27:13.57]You need like a three times larger size cranium for this.
[27:27.98]Oh, my plan!
[27:28.74]No!
[27:34.34]I was trying to grab him.
[27:39.02]This game is so much fun, but it does require you to have, like, seven mechanics memorized.
[27:50.05]What if I just teleported into that guy somehow?
[27:56.78]Oh my god.
[27:57.47]Oh, I'm dead.
[27:59.13]See you later.
[28:01.77]That's not too many.
[28:02.59]Well, here's my thing.
[28:05.61]I'm making dinner at the same time.
[28:08.29]Having to swing around like this and aim and fucking throw abilities.
[28:12.36]I'm making dinner.
[28:14.08]For four people.
[28:26.49]I'm boosting this dude.
[28:33.00]No, I got too focused on trying to shoot him!
[28:39.90]I'm like negative in points right now.
[28:47.00]I'm dead again.
[28:47.46]This game is very fucking hard.
[28:54.22]This is a very difficult game.
[28:58.74]Oh, I have a lasso, too.
[28:59.92]Fuck.
[29:00.18]Another mechanic.
[29:00.80]Another fucking person sat at the table that I have to feed.
[29:02.94]Feed me.
[29:17.84]Let's do it again.
[29:21.77]Let's go to the saloon.
[29:32.99]I gotta follow... No, no.
[29:34.09]One more game.
[29:35.07]I'll put the Discord shirt on.
[29:40.59]Actually, I wanna go... I gotta drop my sensitivity even more.
[29:56.82]One more game until the emote reveal.
[29:58.20]That'll be like two.
[30:02.22]What the hell is going on here?
[30:10.23]Match starts in... That's actually a pretty effective technique, isn't it?
[30:15.81]Alright, let's go.
[30:29.14]Wait, you can go up?
[30:31.06]go up I didn't know you could die up I thought you had to go out I went up too high look don't blame me I didn't like the oxygen levels up there are just not inhabitable okay that guy done no who killed that guy
[31:02.20]Let's go around here.
[31:05.34]Time to get an oxygen tank.
[31:06.58]Let me reload.
[31:08.77]Turn around the head.
[31:17.67]I don't think it's going to be enough, though.
[31:23.31]There we go.
[31:23.65]This is what I want.
[31:32.93]Fuck.
[31:38.41]Let's go this way.
[31:43.10]Is he going to make it?
[31:44.74]Is he going to make it?
[31:45.50]He's going to make it, isn't he?
[31:54.17]Whoa, I'm in the vortex.
[31:55.35]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[31:57.25]The vortex goes...
[32:09.60]I'm gonna make it.
[32:10.08]Yeah, she made it.
[32:20.61]Just like her, just both.
[32:26.55]Oh, shit.
[32:27.98]It's okay, I'm fine.
[32:31.06]Where are we?
[32:34.02]Well, I got somebody.
[32:37.34]Booster seems OP.
[32:38.28]It is pretty good.
[32:45.80]Oh, fuck.
[32:46.44]Nooo, goddammit.
[32:51.58]Yeah, the guns do not do any damage, they just knock people around.
[33:14.12]No, don't you dare.
[33:16.73]Oh, come on.
[33:17.13]Let me get like a triple kill right here.
[33:18.23]Come on.
[33:18.45]Get the booster up.
[33:18.98]Get the booster up.
[33:19.44]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[33:21.18]Come on.
[33:23.76]What the fuck just happened?
[33:27.06]Why is this guy covered in electricity?
[33:44.93]Oh, let's see.
[33:45.25]I got the shotgun now.
[33:49.43]Alright, I'm gonna put the... Let's put this down here.
[34:04.07]Shit.
[34:04.31]I gotta be really close.
[34:08.78]I want more ammo for this.
[34:14.00]No, don't go in the vortex.
[34:22.51]No, come on.
[34:24.43]Oh, I had an opportunity.
[34:31.04]Fuck, I'm three and six right now.
[34:32.46]I got to at least stay even.
[34:36.34]Oh, give me a fucking break.
[34:37.70]Seriously.
[34:49.66]I just teleported off the map because of how angry I was at that.
[34:53.06]I literally got double tapped the second I spawned.
[34:59.42]Grab, grab, grab!
[35:07.00]What are you doing?
[35:14.55]I'm going under the level somehow.
[35:20.41]All right, well, that's it.
[35:24.03]I didn't come in last.
[35:26.63]I'm starting to have a lot of fun, though.
[35:31.49]Speedrun.
[35:35.58]When the telly is off the map, but you go anyways.
[35:45.13]How's dinner?
[35:46.74]It's going alright.
[35:47.74]I only burnt like two things.
[35:48.90]Alright, let me see what we got.
[35:53.90]Main menu.
[35:55.40]Customization.
[35:56.22]Can I do the whole Discord setup?
[36:00.73]No, I don't want this.
[36:03.43]No, no, no, no.
[36:04.71]Torso.
[36:07.11]Come on, give me this one.
[36:14.49]Getting to level 100.
[36:15.03]I wonder how long that takes.
[36:20.37]Let's go back in the lobby.
[36:24.81]Emotes?
[36:25.09]Yeah, we're going to do the emotes in like 30 minutes.
[36:28.73]Maybe a little bit longer.
[36:29.49]Depends on how much I want to stay in the game.
[36:36.89]Yep, yep, yep.
[36:39.74]Cook the dynamite.
[36:40.96]Throw it.
[36:45.66]Alright, let's do it.
[36:49.68]This is Team Deathmatch.
[36:50.60]I gotta move my microphone too, it's just in the way from the Labo stream.
[36:57.57]Okay, let's go back this way.
[37:13.83]Alright.
[37:15.01]There we go.
[37:15.77]I'll use this.
[37:21.23]Anybody here?
[37:33.52]Oh, shit.
[37:33.94]That would have been pretty cool if I did that.
[37:48.65]Get to the side.
[37:51.31]Need to reload.
[37:57.80]Fuck.
[38:07.04]Do not.
[38:13.30]Wow!
[38:14.34]What the fuck was that thing that hit me?
[38:17.64]I have no idea.
[38:18.88]Alright, I gotta... Don't freak out here.
[38:28.31]Got him.
[38:32.83]Try to hanky in it again.
[38:37.75]Float, float, float.

[39:07.95]Ooh!
[39:21.48]Alright, let's get him to have a weapon.
[39:30.64]I missed!
[39:31.80]How did I miss?
[39:37.13]You gotta be real close.
[39:45.75]Get up here.
[39:48.05]New ability.
[39:48.95]Mines.
[39:52.81]Whoa, what the fuck?
[39:53.83]Alright, this guy plays.
[39:56.97]This guy plays the game.
[39:57.81]Come over here.
[40:26.63]Did I bury him down far enough?
[40:28.31]No.
[40:33.69]Where's he going?
[40:34.31]I don't know what I was trying to do there.
[40:42.70]All the way down.
[40:43.12]Come on.
[40:43.58]All the way down.
[40:51.50]Got him.
[40:52.10]I got him.
[40:52.56]I'm on his back.
[40:53.38]I don't know what I do about this.
[40:57.79]No, don't teleport on him!
[40:59.37]Oh, that was so cool, but I didn't capitalize on it.
[41:01.36]If I had the shotgun, maybe.
[41:02.28]Always check your surroundings.
[41:17.57]You gotta be a better player to use the teleporter.
[41:20.73]Some of you guys could use that really well.
[41:23.16]Alright, let's bury this guy.
[41:34.40]I'm alright.
[41:34.64]I'm two and two.
[41:46.73]Come on.
[41:52.29]He's getting the hang of it.
[41:52.99]I'm getting the hang of it.
[41:55.93]It's fun.
[41:58.23]I have one complaint.
[41:59.27]I'm not sure if I should make the complaint yet.
[42:05.27]I feel like the maps should be bigger.
[42:10.61]By 20% to 30%.
[42:12.53]This is a card.
[42:18.28]Let's do the card.
[42:19.32]This is actually a card game mode.
[42:25.92]I feel like you should play better.
[42:30.82]This is my fourth game ever.
[42:36.84]You can't just instantly jump into a game and be really fucking good at it.
[42:42.50]It takes hours of time before you really truly get a game.
[42:46.19]Wait a minute, hold on.
[42:48.53]You've been playing for like 17 minutes and you're not top scoring every game?
[42:52.73]How could you?
[42:53.75]It's impossible!
[42:59.81]I can.
[43:00.29]Yeah, give me a break.
[43:04.05]You know where you can do that?
[43:05.09]I'll tell you where.
[43:05.69]It's called with your head on the pillow.
[43:08.19]In fucking dreamland.
[43:19.86]Oh, I got an air shot.
[43:22.68]I got him.
[43:30.74]Oh, I was trying to cook myself and launch over there.
[43:45.50]I don't think so.
[43:46.40]Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[43:52.46]Play ball.
[43:53.14]No, I could have thrown it.
[43:54.26]Oh, this game is so much.
[44:00.18]This is, oh man.
[44:01.74]Is that, can I grab that thing?
[44:13.08]I gotta go around.
[44:13.80]I'm like stuck in the corner here.
[44:31.57]No, not in the thing!
[44:32.47]Not in the thing!
[44:33.27]Not in the thing!
[44:34.01]Get me out of there!
[44:35.73]I got out.
[44:36.59]No, I didn't.
[44:40.15]Ay-yi-yi.
[44:40.53]Get out of here.
[44:48.06]Come on.
[44:48.68]See you later.
[44:51.26]I didn't get the kill for that?
[45:03.49]I'm just like a tether ball.
[45:09.01]And I'm already gonna die here.
[45:12.13]God damn it.
[45:14.65]Jesus Christ.
[45:30.03]Nah, it's a shotgun.
[45:33.17]This is a free-for-all again.
[45:43.78]Get it!
[45:44.58]Dammit.
[45:51.38]I just walked over something I didn't want.
[46:09.78]Alright, come on.
[46:18.94]I'm learning.
[46:20.34]I'm learning, right?
[46:26.32]I'm keeping the... No, no, no!
[46:29.50]Mine, mine, mine!
[46:30.28]Mine up and then go down!
[46:43.28]Out of ammo!
[46:55.07]Almost got it.
[46:58.66]Still just middle of the road.
[47:04.44]Yeah, I ran out of air.
[47:05.84]The more air in my gun.
[47:11.84]three out of ten oh come on come on give me a break look at all these discord gamers I know this is the only people that have the game new customization no not yet
[47:35.89]No.
[47:37.19]I think that's it for customization for Discord.
[47:40.35]Why do I want to be Discord guy?
[47:41.76]Like, why?
[47:48.26]Everyone who has the game is in this chat room right now.
[47:53.81]I'm getting better.
[47:54.37]I'm trying.
[47:55.15]I at least want to get to a point where I'm doing okay.
[47:59.93]Hold on.
[48:00.89]Close your ears for a second.
[48:03.09]This is going to make a little bit of bumpy noises.
[48:06.81]I'm going to get this out of the way.
[48:09.31]Okay, a little bit of bumpy noises there.
[48:10.67]Sorry about that.
[48:11.19]Here we go.
[48:12.13]Can you hear me still?
[48:12.75]That guy's trying to get me.
[48:28.20]I went for it.
[48:39.18]Take him all the way down.
[48:41.24]Oh, fuck!
[48:42.08]He did the same thing to me.
[48:44.34]This is control point.
[48:47.27]Okay, now you've gotten interesting.
[48:48.81]Where was this before?
[48:49.55]There's a CP map here.
[49:10.64]That would've been cool if I killed him.
[49:15.06]Damn it.
[49:26.83]Nope.
[49:31.48]Yeah, who got it?
[49:32.02]I don't even know who got that.
[49:41.09]Alright, who's next?
[49:55.56]Don't say that.
[49:56.08]Don't be cocky.
[49:59.46]I could have knocked him off.
[50:00.18]I just didn't want to.
[50:01.16]Ah!
[50:06.35]Oh well.
[50:10.33]Shoot!
[50:23.63]That's it?
[50:23.91]We won?
[50:25.05]That's all it took?
[50:27.61]That's the whole game?
[50:32.51]Okay.
[50:34.41]I wrapped around, I stuck in there, and I won the game.
[50:36.63]There we go, see?
[50:41.49]Third.
[50:46.93]Emote contest when?
[50:47.87]Emote contest when the stream has been live for one hour.
[50:53.02]And 30 to 45 minutes.
[50:55.91]So, like, another 45 minutes or so.
[50:57.15]King of the Hill.
[51:02.59]You're the second worst.
[51:03.67]But we all had one kill, and I am the only guy on the team that has second death.
[51:09.58]So, realistically, we all did the same amount of work.
[51:12.58]I just fell off one more time.
[51:18.85]You said a half an hour ago, an hour ago.
[51:22.36]But that's before I started having fun playing Sky... What's it called?
[51:27.00]Sky Noon.
[51:30.95]Show me the emotes.
[51:31.63]You'll see them!
[51:32.21]Just wait!
[51:33.09]You've waited long enough already.
[51:36.57]What's another, like, seven hours of Sky Noon?
[51:39.27]Alright, so how does this work?
[51:49.93]Same thing as last time, right?
[51:54.50]That guy is gone already.
[51:57.56]I'm going to pull some people in.
[51:58.62]Not going to happen that way.
[52:11.58]Damn it.
[52:16.10]I just pulled him into that.
[52:18.28]I think I actually hit that.
[52:23.64]Damn it.
[52:28.25]Where's he going?
[53:01.49]Didn't hit him.
[53:02.45]That did.
[53:03.52]Oh, that did.
[53:04.06]I got him, too.
[53:08.74]That was a headshot.
[53:12.75]These guys crossed the map right here.
[53:14.09]One, two, three.
[53:14.63]Got him.
[53:36.68]Try to get my weapon.
[53:38.28]Sometimes you gotta change it up.
[53:39.10]This guy's done.
[53:41.61]Bye.
[53:43.13]No, not bye.
[53:43.67]He grabbed.
[53:45.07]Good grab, wherever you went, man.
[53:46.61]Oh, he's right there.
[54:03.75]No, he got away.
[54:05.13]This guy's slippery.
[54:06.61]This guy's really slippery.
[54:17.02]Get out of the way.
[54:19.22]Well, we lost.
[54:29.26]Getting better with the teleports.
[54:31.70]Yeah, I mean, it just takes a little bit.
[54:32.82]It takes... You know, you gotta mess around for like 30, 40 minutes.
[54:38.98]Is it worth the price on Steam?
[54:40.64]I don't know.
[54:41.52]I don't know.
[54:44.85]I don't know.
[54:45.99]That's actually tough to say.
[54:50.73]It's $15.
[54:58.39]Well, it's still in early access.
[55:00.17]Let's put it that way.
[55:00.89]So...
[55:03.96]Depending on what they're going to add, keeping, you know, going forward.
[55:10.92]I don't know.
[55:12.86]If you like what you're seeing here and you want to play it and you want to buy it, go for it.
[55:22.66]Finally got a new... Ah, I can't even do it.
[55:27.64]Who knows?
[55:27.88]They might add a lot more stuff.
[55:37.25]But $15, though, really is not that much of a price tag.
[55:43.89]You know, depending on what they add.
[55:46.16]Look, the gameplay is solid, right?
[55:56.00]Oh my god, I just got destroyed.
[55:59.96]Like, the core of the game is there.
[56:01.22]Oh, I'm dead.
[56:05.74]Yep.
[56:09.35]It is if you play for only 20 minutes.
[56:10.83]Yeah, but I mean, are you gonna play for 20 minutes?
[56:20.48]Got him.
[56:27.90]He's gonna teleport or two, I think.
[56:51.49]So many people over here.
[56:52.99]Too many people over here.
[56:54.91]There we go.
[56:55.29]I'm actually glad I went up here.
[57:01.96]Revolver, good.
[57:13.87]That's a really good... Even just... See how that's hitting them?
[57:16.65]Everything has a lot of knockback.
[57:18.49]So even if you're... Oh, no, and I wasted it.
[57:20.21]And this is me being an idiot.
[57:21.35]I, like, wasted it.
[57:23.32]I was gonna say, if you use the teleporter, you can use it to knock people around.
[57:26.96]But I wasted it.
[57:28.88]Don't listen to me.
[57:29.58]I actually have no idea what the fuck I'm talking about.
[57:40.02]Oh my god, I was not even paying attention.
[57:41.38]I just was throwing grenades.
[57:43.32]I didn't even know what game I was playing right there.
[57:53.91]Got him.
[58:10.48]Ooh, almost had him too.
[58:11.34]Let's see if I can get this guy with a dash.
[58:19.80]Damn it.
[58:30.31]Ah!
[58:31.09]I thought I was going to connect at least with a few of those.
[58:38.27]Lightning has spawned.
[58:46.50]Out of ammo.
[58:46.96]Fuck.
[58:47.64]Out of ammo.
[58:48.14]Oh boy.
[58:48.66]Oh boy.
[58:48.98]Oh boy.
[58:49.44]Did I get somebody?
[58:54.33]Give me it, please!
[59:07.64]No.
[59:11.98]I'm in trouble.
[59:12.40]Yeah, I'm dead.
[59:15.69]God, I gotta get out of that.
[59:16.51]I gotta get away from that like three for four.
[59:17.98]I've been like that for a while now.
[59:27.48]Where's he going?
[59:41.59]Get up here with me.
[59:43.29]Ah.
[59:48.97]Is this a game you'd play if it was free?
[59:50.15]That would have been cool if I had landed one of those shots, but I didn't, unfortunately.
[60:02.26]Didn't line it up correctly.
[60:21.60]Dammit.
[60:30.78]No.
[60:43.51]Ah, what?
[60:44.59]Whatever.
[60:46.33]I'm not a fan of the free-for-all.
[60:47.53]There's too much going on.
[60:49.38]There's too many ways to get hit from 360 degrees that when you have 10 people all doing the same thing.
[60:57.30]I don't like the free-for-all mode.
[61:05.25]Free-for-all, yeah.
[61:06.31]If you had a larger map, maybe.
[61:10.65]The map is too small for a free-for-all.
[61:13.97]With the mechanics of the game.
[61:16.17]That's got to be a large map for that.
[61:22.90]EU people are dying.
[61:24.60]Give us emotes.
[61:25.38]Alright, okay, okay.
[61:27.00]There's like 3,000 people here.
[61:29.06]Let's go over the emotes.
[61:29.96]Why don't we?
[61:30.36]Let's go to the main menu.
[61:31.32]Let's pick by customization.
[61:32.38]Put on a new torso.
[61:33.57]Watermelon!
[61:35.55]With ringers next.
[61:38.11]Oh, whatever.
[61:38.65]That's the only thing I have.
[61:41.91]Okay.
[61:43.25]So.
[61:44.90]Are you guys ready?
[61:45.36]Okay.
[61:47.32]Let's get this off the screen for just a second.
[61:49.74]I can stay on the screen.
[61:50.62]Oh, no, no.
[61:50.96]We're in the middle of a game.
[61:52.28]No, I've got to leave this game.
[61:53.26]All right.
[61:58.06]So, thank you for your patience.
[62:02.18]It's now time to go over the emotes.
[62:04.82]Which emotes won the top five?
[62:08.72]So, we've got to get some epic music.
[62:12.06]Epic music.
[62:13.56]I just typed it in.
[62:14.39]Two hours of epic music.
[62:18.20]How about best epic music?
[62:22.38]The best of epic music.
[62:25.44]So I just created this dope website.
[62:31.62]Fucking ads, man.
[62:35.08]Okay, here we go.
[62:36.62]So, let's reiterate one more time what's going on here.
[62:41.84]If you don't know what happened, a couple of weeks ago the emotes
[62:46.90]Three weeks ago, or so, what was it, like three or four weeks ago?
[62:49.92]We did a contest where the community came together and they made a series of emotes.
[62:56.94]We have voted on those emotes.
[62:59.54]We've narrowed it down to the top five.
[63:02.75]So I'm going to show them to you now.
[63:09.53]Just let this sit in the background.
[63:10.49]Who fucking cares?
[63:11.11]Alright, so.
[63:14.35]At number 5.
[63:18.95]The newest emote.

[63:44.09]Derma IQ and Derma Disgust.
[63:49.43]Rounding us out at number 3.
[63:54.59]Derma Pain.
[63:59.01]Number 2.
[64:02.83]Why is the number 2 such a huge head?
[64:05.67]At number 2.
[64:08.23]We have... Derma Defoe.
[64:14.43]There are your last four.
[64:19.66]And ladies and gentlemen... The number one emote with 32... 31% of the vote.
[64:27.77]More than 30% of everybody clicked on this one.
[64:33.85]And it is... German Nosewipe.
[64:44.52]German nose wipe.
[64:45.62]There are your top five emotes.
[64:51.18]There they are.
[64:51.72]But, but, hold on a second.
[64:53.22]Wait, wait, wait, hold on a minute.
[64:58.11]Wait, are we forgetting something here?
[64:59.91]Are we forgetting something important?
[65:03.19]I mean, we're talking about a contest of emotes.
[65:09.63]What about my vote?
[65:12.22]Don't I get a say in this?
[65:15.14]So yes, those are the top five emotes, but you forgot about my top ten picks!
[65:24.06]Ladies and gentlemen, five more emotes are coming in.
[65:29.35]From this list of ten.
[65:30.51]These are my ten favorites that did not get picked.
[65:34.91]So... If you would please... Vote on this straw poll...
[65:45.50]And pick your favorite emote.
[65:46.78]Because five more are coming in.
[65:49.52]Here are the ones that are already here.
[65:58.76]And here are the ten.
[66:01.60]The top five will be coming in as well.
[66:07.10]So ten collective total emotes.
[66:09.54]And the fucking music wasn't even on.
[66:11.18]God damn it.
[66:11.74]Hold on.
[66:11.96]Can we do this again?
[66:17.71]Wait, wait, hold on a second.
[66:19.27]What?
[66:20.51]Oh, go back.
[66:29.90]Ladies and gentlemen.
[66:31.40]You're forgetting about my picks.
[66:35.11]Because I had a say in this too.
[66:38.13]It's not just about what you guys wanted.
[66:39.95]It's what I wanted as well.
[66:44.45]So here are...
[66:46.07]my top favorite emotes.
[66:47.83]That five of which will be coming in here.
[67:02.64]Fucking whatever.
[67:03.34]There they are.
[67:04.48]I'm looking for like a big breakdown.
[67:06.61]All right.
[67:06.87]Pick your five favorites.
[67:08.93]You get one vote, by the way.
[67:11.81]And we're going to leave that on for the remainder of the stream.
[67:17.58]I will talk about it later but again including these ones and these 10 over here 10 people are going to get a steam gift card or an amazon gift card worth 50 when you uh get contacted which is I'll contact you on discord where we started in the first place right so you get a choice can we delete the dab one I wish we could
[67:48.04]No, no, no, excuse me.
[67:49.16]That's not a dab emote.
[67:50.10]That's me wiping my nose.
[67:57.92]So, whoever 10 of these people win, we will get in touch with you on Discord.
[68:06.00]And you have a choice.
[68:07.11]I can give you a Steam gift card, just a code, or an Amazon gift card, a code.
[68:13.09]There you go.
[68:15.25]And also,
[68:16.86]Those of you that are discouraged.
[68:18.76]Those of you that said, oh, what the fuck, I really, what about, I wanted to, I wanted to give an emote.
[68:23.26]I wanted to participate.
[68:24.18]I didn't even know you were doing this.
[68:26.60]These emotes are going to be here.
[68:29.52]And next year, next year, like, maybe like six months from now, we're going to do another one.
[68:41.06]So, we'll have at least five slots for
[68:45.89]the next you know every six months or so that will be we'll do it again should be fun six months equals a year fifty dollars germ of fireman two but I'm just leaving this on screen as long just so you guys can get a mental note and then please vote on the poll here this poll is going to close
[69:14.23]Probably by the next stream, I would say.
[69:16.33]Maybe like, or maybe even tonight.
[69:20.25]I might just look at it and be like, that's it for the extra five slots.
[69:26.50]So let's, somebody gave a lot of money.
[69:29.04]I'm going to take these off the screen now.
[69:31.88]But yeah, these are the guaranteed ones over here on the right.
[69:41.53]Oops-a-daisy.
[69:45.56]Let's get those off.
[69:47.64]But thank you, thank you Snoop Table for the $50.
[69:49.92]Thank you so much, dude.
[69:52.62]Hey German, just wanna say thanks for all the laughs and wish you luck with the move.
[69:55.90]P.S.
[69:56.42]It's a dab, own it.
[70:00.40]I can't believe, that's gonna stick around for six months.
[70:03.88]Maybe I'll do a, I was thinking about doing a rumble too.
[70:06.80]Where, you know, we'll do like a big tornado tag in the top 10 that people want to stay, which is these 10.
[70:15.63]Let's do something like that.
[70:18.19]Where all but one gets to go away, like we did the meme thing.
[70:22.59]We'll see.
[70:23.36]But thank you so much, NoobTable.
[70:24.64]Really appreciate it.

[70:41.67]Alright, yeah, I can see that.
[70:44.21]By the way, all these, I like them all.
[70:46.51]So any of these top five will be fine for me.
[70:53.33]And again, thank you so much for participating, everybody.

[74:00.54]I need another 12 hour stream.
[74:02.12]I am doing Nintendo Labo next weekend.
[74:05.38]I have to give enough time for everybody to cool down because apparently me playing Nintendo Labo for more than three hours two days ago was... I was just pressing nuclear detonation buttons across the globe.
[74:19.86]And people were like, stop!
[74:21.01]Stop doing that, dude!
[74:22.05]Stop it!
[74:22.31]What are you doing?
[74:23.31]How about this one?

[74:26.23]Like I was a mad scientist.
[74:33.62]So we're building the robot Labo next weekend.
[74:40.34]And that's going to be a long stream.
[74:42.14]I'm enjoying the Labo.
[74:43.16]It's a dumb thing, but it's fun to play.
[74:46.39]It's fun to sit there and just talk and hang out with you guys.
[74:51.60]So we're going to do a Blind Legend on Tuesday.
[74:53.16]And then... I'm trying to get something else happening here.
[75:01.35]That should be very, very interesting.
[75:04.07]I can't give you a time frame, but it'll happen before I move.
[75:07.15]100%.
[75:08.29]Before I move to Vegas, there's going to be something fucking weird on this stream.
[75:15.89]So let's play, right?
[75:17.85]But thank you so much, Megamoob.
[75:19.85]You will see more Labo next weekend.
[75:21.57]All right, let's play.
[75:26.19]Let me, like, get back to what I was doing here.
[75:27.71]I got that guy?
[75:36.01]I don't know if that guy's paying attention.
[75:37.57]I don't know if that guy's in the game or not.
[75:45.61]I just bounced off that guy.
[75:53.59]No, I didn't... Did I get an assist for that?
[75:55.95]Dammit.
[75:57.61]He's gonna be a nude screen.
[75:59.81]Now, Tuesday will be interesting.
[76:01.60]I'm gonna have... I'm gonna do all kinds of face cam scene stuff.
[76:05.02]Because it's gonna be a black screen.
[76:07.60]So, I have to imagine... It'll be interesting to put on... Oh my god, when I do it, I'm not gonna pay attention anymore.
[76:18.40]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[76:20.67]I'm like out of the game at this moment.
[76:25.41]Here we go.
[76:31.95]Alright, easy.
[76:43.54]I felt that one all the way down into my stomach, I did.
[76:55.21]See if I can blow somebody away like this.
[76:57.13]Got it.
[77:00.74]Did I get somebody?
[77:01.32]Kind of.
[77:03.24]Not really, though.
[77:13.01]Wrap around the side.
[77:14.19]I got that guy.

[96:56.90]Nobody listened to this song.
[97:20.19]I don't know one person that actually likes this.
[97:21.81]You only hear this at weddings.
[97:23.79]They play it, like, four times.
[97:26.61]And everybody gets in the circle, and they all sing it, and they pretend to like the song.
[97:30.31]Nobody actually listens to the song.
[97:38.69]Alright, we're gonna do wedding songs?
[97:41.09]Alright, fine.
[97:44.67]Just wait for the next wedding song.

[98:07.79]Everyone's so happy.
[98:09.57]I used to videotape weddings.
[98:15.78]I know everything about them.
[98:18.07]I know every wedding that's ever happened.
[98:25.34]Yeah, what the fuck?
[98:25.90]Why do those people have it?
[98:26.62]Is this like a payload race?

[100:50.35]And then somebody brings out the little kid, the one and a half, two year old, and they're standing them up, holding their hands, making their arms go up and down one by one.
[100:59.80]And make sure you get a close up of that one, right?
[101:01.52]Everybody wants that.
[101:02.20]When I was a wedding fucking videographer, right?
[101:04.50]You get close up on that.
[101:06.92]Uncle Frank doing the one hand up, one hand down, one hand up, one hand down with a little kid.

[101:27.55]What's this?
[101:28.17]What's happening here?
[101:29.79]All the groomsmen are picking up the bride and they're like swinging her up and down and she's like, zoom in on that.
[101:36.91]I was at the back just like zoomed in.
[101:38.39]It was like a telephoto lens.
[101:51.86]I got a lot of complaints.
[101:53.08]Because half of my footage was way too telephoto zoomed in.
[101:56.40]I was getting people's, like, necks.
[101:59.30]The whole screen was filled up with, like, full faces, necks, arms, and shit.
[102:03.79]I got a lot of complaints.
[102:05.79]But you got that telephoto zoom factor.
[102:07.73]Nobody, like, understands film, you know what I mean?
[102:09.91]Alright, I'm playing the game for, like, five minutes.

[103:51.06]You gotta be kidding me.
[103:52.08]Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[103:53.70]I had to get that kill, right?
[103:54.64]That was a full... Yeah, I was gonna say, what?

[104:42.78]Whoa, you, okay.
[104:44.50]Interesting.
[104:53.50]Oh, come on.
[104:54.16]Did I get him?
[104:54.72]Did I at least get him?
[104:56.70]I didn't get that kill.
[104:58.20]I stuffed him down so far too.
[105:08.56]Got him.
[105:10.11]Oh, fuck.
[105:10.75]I wasn't paying attention.
[105:11.79]Come on.
[105:12.05]Give me more.
[105:13.41]More than that.
[105:21.97]Okay.

[105:31.17]That's all I ask.
[105:39.70]You ever see something like that before in your entire life?
[105:54.05]Whatever.
[106:08.78]Let's get the super thing.
[106:18.03]Back against the wall.
[106:18.75]Back against the wall.
[106:19.41]Back against the wall.
[106:20.33]Flow one.
[106:22.53]Whatever.
[106:22.74]I did all right.
[106:25.18]Okay.
[106:25.46]All right.
[106:25.80]Okay.
[106:26.24]Okay.
[106:26.52]Here comes the next.
[106:27.30]What was the first sound effect that somebody wrote?
[106:34.87]What was it?
[106:38.10]Oh, the game sound is low because I had to turn the whole thing down.
[106:40.12]All right.
[106:41.96]There was a fart.
[106:45.06]No.
[106:46.74]That was actually the first one.
[106:47.78]How about fart compilation?
[106:51.74]All right, autocorrect.
[106:53.80]Okay, I just typed in fartco compilation.
[107:00.86]I got autofilled.
[107:02.28]It said fart compilation, try not to laugh.
[107:07.48]What?
[107:07.86]What do you mean, try not to laugh?
[107:13.59]I refuse to watch that.
[107:14.49]All right, I saw somebody said helicopter sounds.
[107:51.50]There are people that are gonna think that just come in that this is a game sound.
[108:01.94]I cleared everybody off that, c'mon.
[108:13.39]Too many people.
[108:19.29]C'mon, that had to be an obvious kill.
[108:27.25]Got them all off.
[108:29.01]Not that guy.
[108:29.57]Is that it?
[108:31.33]I think that's it for the helicopter sounds.
[108:32.57]I don't know what's going to auto play.
[108:35.15]Triple kill.
[108:35.81]Give it to me.
[108:36.29]Come on.
[108:36.89]I deserve it.
[108:37.63]I deserve it.
[108:44.00]Whoa, slow down.
[108:51.18]What is playing now?
[108:58.49]This is just a reactor turning on.
[109:12.18]This sucks.
[109:18.96]This is a tooth drill.
[109:20.66]I don't want this on anymore, but I can.
[109:22.34]I'm in a five kill streak.
[109:33.36]Why did I turn this on?
[109:35.32]What did I turn this on for?
[109:42.94]This is a helicopter.
[109:45.11]Oh my fucking god.
[109:53.51]I can't turn it off!
[109:58.49]I'm doing so well, I can't just alt-tab out.
[110:13.84]Okay, thank God it's finally done.
[110:23.75]What's auto-playing?
[110:25.25]Oh, it's another helicopter.
[110:33.81]Oh, wait.
[110:35.19]What is this?
[110:35.70]I can't hear it.
[110:57.52]No, dude.
[110:58.58]I can't believe we just lost.
[111:00.12]Give me that 7-0.
[111:00.58]Maybe I should keep the helicopter sounds on.
[111:07.16]Get the fuck out of here.
[111:17.78]Play glass breaking.
[111:20.22]Frog sounds.
[111:20.84]Alright, I'll take that one.
[111:24.74]Okay, frog sounds at night.
[111:26.34]Frogs and their calls.
[111:31.56]All right, how about frog calls?
[111:46.24]Okay.
[111:47.74]Can you name the frog?
[111:49.98]That's not a frog.
[112:05.80]Is that a monkey?
[112:07.42]That's a frog?
[112:12.34]That's a velociraptor.
[112:13.28]That's not a frog.
[112:16.35]Why are they dinosaurs?
[112:23.63]Here we go.
[112:27.75]Come on.
[112:36.82]Got him.
[112:37.32]I pulled him, but he didn't... Nah.
[112:44.37]Slow it down here.
[112:47.57]Sorry.
[112:50.97]Is this free-for-all?
[112:51.83]Yeah, it is.
[112:58.58]Damn it.
[113:01.10]These are just keyboard presses.
[113:07.88]Ah, he teleported right behind me.
[113:15.11]Dammit.
[113:16.51]This is not- I don't even like this sound effect.
[113:39.82]Did it work?
[113:40.73]Kind of.
[113:49.37]God damn it.
[113:51.29]I'm getting shit on.
[113:54.54]Compilation, try not to laugh.
[113:55.76]I'm not putting it on.
[113:56.48]That's the coolest one.
[114:00.02]What frog is this?
[114:01.00]That's a bubbling casino.
[114:02.24]That was that one.
[114:04.28]That was the coolest one.
[114:05.08]That sounded like a video game.
[114:20.30]Damn it.
[114:21.68]Got it.
[114:22.46]Ooh.
[114:23.44]All right.

[115:06.81]That guy with the supercharge.
[115:07.89]Stop supercharging me.
[115:09.03]Not fair.
[115:12.67]Why is this guy... That frog is a cluck.
[115:21.02]Frogs are so weird.
[115:29.11]I hate this.
[115:29.45]I fucking hate this.
[115:35.30]This is causing so many problems.
[116:02.56]Yeah, this is frog.

[127:07.34]This game's a lot of fun.
[127:16.42]I'm gonna wrap around the whole thing now.
[127:35.93]Oh, almost.
[127:40.78]What did they do that for?
[127:42.04]Alright, you know, I have to start a game and play it through, rather than just fumble through fucking music.
[128:29.36]None of those hit.
[128:30.28]Fuck you.
[128:31.42]Why?
[128:32.92]Why?

[129:30.40]Just play cowboy music.
[129:32.76]That's a good idea.
[129:38.61]How about cowboy background music?
[129:44.38]This looks all right.
[129:54.60]I can handle this.
[129:55.76]Audio jungle.
[129:58.42]Audio jungle.
[129:59.16]Audio jungle.
[129:59.76]This is stolen.

[130:05.34]Audio jungle.
[130:07.58]Yeah, that's a stolen song.
[130:09.72]Okay, let's try another one.

[134:18.18]It works pretty well if you can get it.
[134:19.38]If you can get it.
[134:29.57]Back against the wall.
[134:33.35]Why did I let go?
[134:34.49]What the fuck is going on with my mouse?
[134:43.09]Tap, tap, tap.
[134:52.28]Did I get it?
[134:56.66]He might have been close enough.
[134:57.54]No, I got him.
[135:02.17]Yeah.
[135:03.83]19 ammo, I gotta say.

[135:39.43]Yeah, the game's... the core gameplay is very, very good.
[135:46.01]It is.
[135:47.78]The game's very fun.
[135:51.12]The more that I play it, the more that I like it.
[135:55.85]It is $15 and it's in early access, but I've seen some early access games that were way more than $15 that were terrible.
[136:07.12]This feels very developed.
[136:09.10]This feels like somebody put a lot of time into this.
[136:15.92]Karma music?
[136:17.91]Sure.
[136:22.77]Classic circus music.
[136:27.75]This isn't going to be that loud, though.
[136:28.85]I want to be able to concentrate.
[136:41.19]I'm ready.
[136:43.17]This actually works here.
[136:46.49]It works here.
[136:47.45]This is very old-timey.
[136:49.37]It fits pretty well.
[137:14.76]Go in here.
[137:17.22]This is fail compilation music.
[137:19.13]It is.

[138:36.27]Let's try this again.
[138:45.17]He went all the way down.
[138:46.35]Coming her up!
[138:51.31]Holy shit, too many people.
[138:52.59]Did I high enough in the air?
[138:56.03]No, he's alive.
[139:13.00]Why is it playing again?
[139:13.80]The song is playing the same song again.
[139:17.80]I don't want to listen to the same song.
[139:27.61]Am I getting any assists either?
[139:47.31]Holy shit, that was very plucky.
[139:49.05]Where'd he go?
[139:50.23]Pop up!
[139:51.27]Mmm!
[139:51.87]Oh fuck, I'm dead.
[140:17.11]This is the first time I've died.
[140:18.29]I've done a whole lot of nothing.
[140:21.89]Turn this shit off.
[140:31.52]I mean, I feel like I've been playing a lot and moving around a lot.
[140:34.15]I just haven't connected with anything, apparently.
[140:53.55]I don't like the boots.
[140:55.95]I'd rather just teleport around.
[140:58.61]What?
[140:58.75]I don't even know what the fuck happened.
[140:59.77]Yeah, get these fucking boots off.
[141:01.10]It's the worst.
[141:05.64]Turn it off.
[141:06.92]I- Turn it off!
[141:09.04]I can't fucking handle it.
[141:10.04]It's just like a piano in my fucking ear.
[141:16.67]I can't handle that.
[141:25.86]I'm getting shit on.
[141:26.72]I've got an idea for concentration.
[141:33.82]That's the stupidest idea I've had all year.

[141:57.27]I didn't do anything.
[141:59.33]Well, that's not true.

[148:29.54]Still better than the Lavo stream.
[148:34.65]I'm just playing the game and having fun.
[148:39.77]How did I make the subscribe noise?
[148:41.29]I did not make it.
[148:45.46]That is from Monster Rancher 2.
[148:51.04]One of the monsters makes that noise.
[148:54.06]Stolen.
[149:00.04]My keyboard doesn't work anymore.
[149:02.46]There we go.
[149:02.74]All right, you want to play more music?
[149:16.60]Somebody made this joke earlier, and I'm going to do it.
[149:32.01]Let's see.
[149:32.77]This is a Bioshock Infinite OST.
[149:39.74]Play the Donkey Kong Country 2 theme song.
[149:46.32]Wait, doesn't it play like some Christian music?
[149:48.24]Head or tails?
[149:48.86]Head or tails?
[149:49.22]Ah, that would have been nice.
[149:50.18]Ah, that would have been nice.

[151:14.89]Here it is.
[151:15.25]I don't know how this fits in here, but apparently it does.
[151:22.51]This way.
[151:43.53]I keep on just barely getting back there.
[151:47.69]Don't blow it now.
[151:58.29]Ooh, that was good.
[151:59.03]Come on.
[151:59.39]Give me that.
[151:59.83]Is that high enough?
[152:10.64]Not this time.
[152:11.84]Zero, zero, zero.
[152:21.20]What a weird stream this has been.
[152:29.66]What?
[152:30.04]It did something.
[152:34.89]I missed the bottle of lightning, stupid person.
[152:37.89]You're not me.
[152:39.91]What's with the hitscan there, man?
[152:44.53]What's with the hitscan there, man?
[152:45.43]Does someone want to get a doctor in here and find out what the hell that was?
[152:55.47]I'm dead.
[152:59.45]How long is this?
[153:04.39]How long is this actual song?
[153:07.43]That would have been nice.
[153:10.54]So would that.
[153:13.00]That would have been nice, too.
[153:16.90]I think I just teleported into another item.
[153:19.90]Let's do that again.
[153:25.31]It loops until I finish the quest.
[153:30.21]Not enough.
[153:47.07]Roblox.
[153:47.61]Roblox has an OST.
[153:48.77]No, it doesn't.
[153:52.76]I mean, I've never played Roblox, so I can't... I'm not the one to tell you that that's what it is.
[153:58.26]All the way around.
[154:04.64]Go all the way around.
[154:16.45]That was pretty nice.
[154:18.11]Did I get it?
[154:21.24]I love this song, by the way.
[154:22.13]This is my favorite song in the whole soundtrack.
[154:25.17]I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.
[154:41.26]The grappling hook is really satisfying, it is.
[154:48.73]It's very satisfying, and I did nothing again.
[154:50.64]Alright, no music again.
[155:02.99]We'll do song, and then no song.
[155:09.15]When there's music, I play like a seven-year-old.
[155:11.95]When there's no music...
[155:16.05]That's how many hits I get in a rough.
[155:26.47]Hey, I was enjoying that.
[155:27.81]Well, the round ended.
[155:33.58]You played so well with the helicopter sounds, because that's not even, that's not music.
[155:39.46]That's just background noise.
[155:40.86]That's falling asleep.
[155:43.75]I could probably fall asleep to the helicopter noise.
[155:45.23]It's just white noise.
[155:55.82]I should play the Gamers soundtrack on Spotify.
[155:57.88]I don't even have Spotify.
[156:05.29]I'm gonna grab him.
[156:09.38]Pirates?
[156:09.68]I'm not playing Pirates of the Caribbean.
[156:11.38]Let me get one round of no music, where I try and get shots.
[156:26.12]No talking, just shots.
[156:42.51]No talking, death shots.
[156:51.31]Stay in here.
[156:56.97]Shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot.
[157:10.02]Dammit, not close enough.
[157:17.16]Damn it.
[157:17.98]No, I wanted the shotgun.
[157:30.25]I gotta get a direct hit, man.
[157:32.63]I gotta land that.
[157:39.53]There we go.
[158:00.21]Trying to get greedy there.
[158:04.44]Play the Hey Gamers song.
[158:07.46]How did that one go?
[158:14.66]That ain't gonna happen to me.
[158:15.62]Not right now.
[158:21.93]Oh, boy.
[158:23.07]Almost happened.
[158:28.19]Keep the booster.
[158:29.65]Oh, fuck.
[158:34.11]Buried him enough?
[158:35.05]Yep.
[158:47.21]That would be a double if it was... Ah, I didn't get it.
[158:50.35]Oh well.
[158:53.24]Did I show the emote winners?
[158:54.12]Yep.
[158:55.72]I'll show it again, don't worry.
[158:58.98]You will see them again.
[159:11.00]Shit.
[159:13.71]That was a panic, but it still worked.
[159:27.77]Not enough.
[159:29.62]Oh, it was enough.
[159:31.78]Lightning, give me the lightning.
[159:32.48]Give me, give me, give me, give me.
[159:34.14]Okay, I got it.
[159:34.48]It lasts a long time too.
[159:43.88]I gotta utilize this thing.
[159:57.05]Somebody else, somebody else, quick!
[159:58.01]Come on, come on, come on!
[160:00.39]Damn it!
[160:01.45]You blew it!
[160:13.94]No, I'm dead.
[160:14.48]Alright, I'm in first place, so I'm doing alright.
[160:29.45]Gotta boost somebody here.
[160:39.72]Two eliminations left, I gotta make one!
[160:48.28]Oy yoy!
[160:56.82]Shit.
[160:57.32]C'mon, I gotta get this.
[161:02.42]Where'd he go?
[161:03.80]Come on!
[161:04.08]I gotta get it!
[161:05.08]Eight and five!
[161:05.82]Eight and two!
[161:16.08]Everybody!
[161:16.54]Hey!
[161:16.90]I did it!
[161:17.34]I finally won a round!
[161:18.44]It only took three hours.
[161:32.09]These are paid actors.
[161:35.51]Don't blow my cover here, man.
[161:37.34]Come on.
[161:46.10]I like this game.
[161:48.28]It just needs more.
[161:48.94]Oh, Hightown again.
[161:56.78]Hey, FantasticPhoenix, thanks for the $10 here.
[162:00.42]German, could you please add German Neptune?
[162:02.50]I think it's the best emote by far.
[162:03.92]And while I understand it's important to you to let your fans participate in your streams as much as possible, it's not fair for Neptune to be left out of your growing solar system.
[162:12.11]Please don't let Neptune be lonely.
[162:15.59]I shot Neptune with a rocket launcher from my backyard.
[162:18.66]I ended up in just...
[162:25.00]And I watched it the whole way.
[162:27.54]And it went, all you could hear was just, it traveled for like, I don't know, I did this maybe four years ago.
[162:33.39]And all you could do is look up and at the right moment I had it calculated out so you would just see in the distance a tiny little blip explosion and it just sounded like this.
[162:55.69]Launch somebody out.
[162:56.37]Come on.
[162:56.55]A lot of ways to fall down in this one.
[163:04.03]Case in point.
[163:05.45]I got him.
[163:07.97]But did I, though?
[163:18.41]I'm not good with the shotgun.
[163:19.45]I'm not.
[163:26.61]I bet you teleport too.
[163:34.41]Cha-ching!
[163:42.00]Yeah, the German default will be here.
[163:44.04]German nose wipe.
[163:45.68]You will see it, don't worry.
[163:50.14]Oh, fuck.
[163:50.74]I misused that.
[163:55.09]I love Overwatch.
[163:55.87]This is not Overwatch.
[163:56.79]This is Sky Noon.
[163:59.13]You can get it now on Steam for $14.99.
[164:01.08]Have fun with your friends.
[164:09.70]Who can get the most frags?
[164:13.75]If it's a shill.
[164:15.37]Is it really?
[164:15.87]If I'm having a good time, is it a shill?
[164:23.63]Is it a shield?
[164:26.05]If you're just having a blast.
[164:36.20]I'll tell you, the more I play it, the more I like it.
[164:41.34]It's different enough.
[164:48.32]Like I said, I just wish the maps were a little bit bigger.
[164:55.27]Damn it, that would've been cool.
[164:57.05]Still wibbly.
[164:58.03]Fuck.
[165:03.39]God damn it.
[165:04.31]I've only died twice.
[165:16.16]That's it, we win.
[165:17.62]These rounds don't last very long either.
[165:23.99]Press H for hints.
[165:24.71]No, I know how to use these stuff.
[165:26.43]These stuff.
[165:32.25]What are you guys writing in here?
[165:33.66]You guys want me to do... What are you writing?
[165:42.66]No, we're done with music.
[165:44.50]No more music.
[165:45.24]I just want to play.
[165:49.91]I just want to play.
[165:55.61]No, I want Doom.
[165:59.94]Oh, by the way, if you missed it, here are the winners of the emote contest, and then please go to this link if you would, and pick your favorite one out of these ten, because five of these are coming in as well.
[166:10.44]Just making sure everyone's aware.
[166:11.76]There it is, for your viewing pleasure.
[166:23.01]Okay.
[166:23.15]Okay.
[166:34.86]What is two supposed to be?
[166:37.48]That's Willem Dafoe's mouth on my face because we look very similar.
[166:42.86]From a stream from like last year.
[166:46.64]I'm getting first place this time.
[166:54.82]I feel a first place victory here.
[167:03.54]Come on, give me a first place victory.
[167:13.19]Wow, I got launched.
[167:18.77]The pretend telephone stream.
[167:20.06]Yeah, sometimes we do those.
[167:23.06]It's not real though, it's fake telephone stream.
[167:24.82]That's why it says pretend.
[167:31.91]He actually got me.
[167:33.01]Let's drag him down here.
[167:35.91]Did I bait him down there?
[167:36.73]Did it work?
[167:37.85]Not really.
[167:49.60]Wow, that was lucky.
[167:57.24]Stop hitting me.
[167:57.90]Stop it.
[168:06.85]Bury him down there.
[168:08.42]No!
[168:09.48]God damn it.
[168:13.50]I'm supposed to be in first place today.
[168:30.83]Damn.
[168:34.87]Thought I had that too.
[168:37.81]almost not quite though ah it's too bad you know what this needs this needs virtual reality
[169:05.89]I can tell you, that would be interesting.
[169:08.79]I don't know if it would be good.
[169:09.73]Fuck.
[169:19.98]Get me down here.
[169:28.82]Back on the playing field.
[169:31.84]Oh, fuck.
[169:32.46]I wasn't paying attention.
[169:33.38]Shit, he was right behind me.
[169:36.64]I want a different ability.

[170:44.42]Ah, ah, ah, every time!
[171:05.69]go this way.
[171:07.92]Nobody has the thing.
[171:11.08]Where'd he go?
[171:11.44]He's up there?
[171:17.58]Let's do it again!
[171:23.87]Well, that's that.
[171:26.91]Why are we in emote only?
[171:27.79]What happened?
[171:36.69]Why is everyone freaking out?
[171:37.33]What happened?
[171:41.93]People spamming numbers?
[171:48.55]Oh, why are we counting?
[171:49.51]What are we counting up to?
[171:59.40]I got the Twitch load out.
[172:00.60]That's good.
[172:01.24]King of the hill.
[172:07.20]boredom riot I think this game's fun until I bring back the music all right fine here's the song
[172:37.54]Not classic paintings, classic piano.
[172:47.52]There, how's that?
[172:48.90]Yep.
[172:49.90]Nope, he got me.
[173:07.09]I got him!
[173:12.36]That back and forth was fun!
[173:14.44]I'm gonna blast this guy.
[173:42.71]Are you guys relaxed with this piano?
[173:44.45]You should be.
[173:48.45]Hey, I just created a Wix website for my business.
[173:51.07]What the fuck was that?
[173:51.99]Okay, why?
[173:53.59]What, there was an ad already?
[173:54.78]I feel like somebody just hacked my computer.
[174:00.32]That just scared the absolute shit out of me.
[174:01.92]I thought somebody hacked my computer.
[174:05.36]I was gonna tell me, like, hey, that's what you get for not putting on music.
[174:10.71]Hold on, I'll get it back.
[174:12.72]Oh, I see.
[174:13.06]It's one of these videos that has like 30 ads in it.
[174:20.22]Well, that didn't do nothing.
[174:21.98]That didn't do anything.
[174:23.44]That didn't do nothing at all.
[174:32.76]Damn it.
[174:34.68]Just blew everything.
[174:45.35]I just wanted to do that.
[174:48.63]That's it, right?
[174:49.07]Come on, get out of here.
[174:53.52]Never mind.
[174:58.06]Reload!
[175:04.20]That's far enough away.
[175:04.94]Yeah, he is.
[175:10.89]Oh shit!
[175:11.77]In my pants!
[175:12.69]I'm good.

[175:25.96]Come on get out of here really oh God damn it man that guy held on for so long Got it
[175:56.10]Back against the wall.
[175:56.81]There it is.
[175:57.25]That was a nice play.
[176:00.73]That was a double team right there.
[176:09.65]Got it, right?
[176:10.82]Far enough away.
[176:20.90]Oh, shit.
[176:21.78]Oh, shit.
[176:22.80]Oh, there we go.
[176:27.71]Oh, the piano, right?
[176:28.76]Well, hell, let me skip the ad first.
[176:30.90]I can't skip.
[176:32.44]Okay, now I can.
[176:41.09]Where did the piano go?
[176:42.71]Where did the piano?
[176:46.97]Sorry about the piano.
[176:48.05]I didn't mean to.
[176:58.65]Watch this.
[177:00.01]Ah, that would've been cool.
[177:09.01]Shit.
[177:16.22]No!
[177:16.66]Detonate it!
[177:17.24]What?
[177:17.42]Am I too far away to detonate it?
[177:18.60]Shitten.
[177:22.60]Look, it's my song.
[177:23.50]I made this song!
[177:24.64]I made this song!
[177:34.03]Ah, we lost.
[177:34.69]Ah, shit, I'm supposed to stand on it.
[177:43.29]It's a nice, peaceful music ad.
[177:44.61]Let's skip to 30 minutes.
[177:45.61]Let's get another ad for that stupid website builder.
[177:57.65]I wonder how much that service is.
[178:01.74]Just think about it.
[178:03.67]If you paid for that service, rather than just pay somebody to make you a website, you'd probably save more money buying somebody to make a website for you.
[178:19.24]Oh, that's not... I thought that was the music in the game.
[178:27.36]Paying somebody is like $3,000?
[178:28.16]Yeah, well...
[178:32.21]How much is it to... How much is that service?
[178:36.18]You have 40 bucks a month or something?
[178:37.56]Like $50 a month?
[178:56.88]$2,000 an hour for a website?
[178:58.10]Is it?
[178:58.48]No, it's not.
[178:58.94]Is it really that expensive now?
[179:00.65]It's not.
[179:07.68]$2,000 an hour.
[179:19.89]This is free-for-all, I gotta remember.
[179:21.05]Oh, fuck.
[179:28.65]I could smell that one and it didn't even happen.
[179:42.42]Oh, no.
[179:43.30]Oh, boy!
[179:44.28]That was lucky.
[179:46.24]Just barely caught the end of that one.
[180:01.71]Not enough.
[180:02.11]Gonna fall out of the way.
[180:04.17]No.
[180:07.67]You charge $60 an hour?
[180:08.97]So where'd the $2,000 come from?
[180:27.59]That comes from a made up lie.
[180:28.71]Oh, that's where it comes from.
[180:32.75]Give me that, I don't like this ability.
[180:48.94]There we go, that's better.
[180:57.62]It's enough.
[180:59.40]Maybe this will be enough.
[181:03.57]Nope.
[181:12.95]Hold on for dear life.
[181:23.88]Easy now.
[181:24.34]All right.
[181:25.00]Get rid of the shotgun.
[181:36.80]Oh my god.
[181:37.96]I'm getting hit by everything.
[181:38.81]Alright, stay in here for a sec.
[181:44.77]Try to lasso somebody that comes down here.
[181:51.36]Like you, but no, not far enough.
[181:53.90]Maybe not.
[181:54.74]Can he make it?
[181:59.12]Instead of being so concerned about it, just shoot the next one.
[182:14.86]Snipe.
[182:14.98]Alright, I'm going this way.
[182:17.90]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[182:18.46]This thing.
[182:23.36]Oh, come on now.
[182:24.28]Come on, Jeremy.
[182:25.22]What the hell was that?
[182:26.18]I got it.
[182:31.12]What the fuck?
[182:34.01]That's so infuriating.
[182:37.21]My thing was not up yet.
[182:42.77]My ability wasn't recharged yet.
[182:55.98]I thought I could get it.
[183:12.39]Move this way.
[183:12.87]Oh, by the way, the piano don't help.
[183:23.49]Where?
[183:23.69]I was filled with the earth.
[183:27.06]What is happening?
[183:40.07]Underneath, underneath, underneath.
[183:50.36]Wrong side.
[183:51.36]Where am I in the leaderboard right now?
[183:59.69]Yeah.
[184:00.67]4 and 2.
[184:01.18]Whatever.
[184:07.38]Game has a lot of competitive potential.
[184:10.08]Yeah.
[184:13.23]It seems like they just... So, content-wise, yeah, there's only a few maps and a couple of different game modes.
[184:20.43]All the development time was to make the core game so far.
[184:25.15]They at least... We can give them a stamp of approval here.
[184:30.65]They didn't wait to put this on early access while they were still in a pre-alpha with like three assets.
[184:41.15]That happens all the time.
[184:46.90]We can at least give them that.
[184:55.79]Now, four or five more maps.
[184:59.43]Another game mode.
[185:01.25]Make some larger terrain.
[185:06.21]$15.
[185:06.25]I think you got yourself a deal.
[185:13.73]It does take a little bit to get used to, though.
[185:17.71]Capture the flag.
[185:18.27]That would be cool, too.
[185:28.72]creepy dentist music we got on right now what do you mean creepy dentist music last time get your wisdom teeth taken out I guarantee you this song is playing
[186:11.26]Oh, I get it.
[186:11.84]He's invincible.
[186:13.24]I get it.
[186:13.72]I guess the things are going to spawn down here.
[186:24.19]Oh, fuck.
[186:26.47]I missed him.
[186:27.53]Back against the wall.
[186:32.51]Back against the wall.
[186:33.18]It's going to spawn here in a second.
[186:35.06]Got it.
[186:42.36]Shotgun should be insane at this point.
[186:43.90]And it is.
[186:45.10]Not enough.
[186:47.21]Got one.
[186:49.75]Ooh, he bounced!
[186:52.71]He bounced off the top.
[187:12.58]I just lassoed him around the neck.
[187:19.17]Oh, I need that.
[187:19.93]Give me that... I was gonna say McDonald's Happy Meal.
[187:22.36]No, the Mario Kart thing.
[187:48.29]No ammo left.
[187:49.66]Something new, quick!
[187:54.58]Machine pistol, there we go.
[187:56.02]That's what I like to see.
[187:56.88]Not good enough.
[188:09.74]Not good enough!
[188:24.96]Okay.
[188:27.90]He's doing much better, though.
[188:35.99]I like this combo, because you can launch him and then do one or two good shots.
[188:39.97]And you usually can get him to knock off.
[188:43.61]You know, first of all, like, knock it off right.
[189:11.91]Damn.
[189:12.53]That's a double damn.
[189:13.17]That flow there.
[189:38.16]Spawning.
[189:38.50]Where's the spawning?
[189:40.78]Two eliminations left.
[189:47.34]Before it's over.
[189:53.60]I did not go that far, man.
[189:55.14]I went very, very... That was... What?
[189:57.29]That was dumb.
[190:13.20]Ah!
[190:14.48]So close.
[190:14.92]The fucking bridge!
[190:22.28]No!
[190:22.60]Get off the bridge!
[190:26.49]Well, whatever.
[190:27.65]Doing better.
[190:37.47]How about, uh, background music?
[190:41.87]How about background music for YouTubers?
[190:43.88]Let's see how many of these we can pick out.
[190:48.30]Background music YouTubers use.
[190:58.66]Royalty-free background music used by YouTubers.
[191:02.07]Wait, is this a compilation of who uses the songs?
[191:09.66]Hey, this is me!
[191:10.96]This is me, I did this!
[191:13.54]I'm a YouTuber, I did this song!
[191:20.22]Hold on, this... This is not, this is the Brad song.
[191:30.49]Let's skip ahead.
[191:41.78]Now I'm freaked out.
[191:46.35]Go back to that first one.
[192:27.10]Take an ice cream is on its way.
[192:31.02]And Michael.
[192:38.60]Come over here.
[192:39.10]Come over here.
[192:39.56]Somebody fooled you.
[192:41.63]Trying to catch him with it.
[192:59.57]Back around the side, all the way up to the top of the mountain.
[193:04.46]Rock Candy Mountain.
[193:08.70]Damn it, not enough time.
[193:20.09]Damn it.
[193:21.61]I tried.
[193:21.99]I tried.
[193:32.44]No shotgun.
[193:33.04]Machine pistol.
[193:39.59]Ready to go.
[193:41.59]Where are you, buddy?
[193:56.05]Let's get down there.
[194:05.48]Oh, no, it doesn't assist.
[194:14.41]Watch out.
[194:20.20]No, good guys.
[194:20.90]Where are the bad guys?
[194:24.90]Trying to solidify that kill.
[194:36.98]Crap it.
[194:42.56]He's invincible.
[194:43.52]Playing whale sounds?
[194:50.66]I mean, I could.
[194:56.15]Dammit.
[194:57.65]Not doing a whole lot this round.
[195:00.47]I'm getting BM'd?
[195:04.01]Am I?
[195:04.93]Who's BMing me?
[195:20.96]Reload.
[195:21.70]Oh, thank goodness.
[195:26.26]He didn't beat him.
[195:32.15]Did I show him down?
[195:36.09]Damn it, there he is.
[195:41.85]Is it enough?
[195:43.81]Don't think so.
[195:44.27]Lightning.
[195:46.23]Lightning.
[195:57.09]Come on, get it!
[195:58.75]Where is it?
[196:06.96]There it is.
[196:07.36]Oh, it falls all the way down like the fucking ball drop on New Year's Eve.
[196:19.47]Shit.
[196:26.99]Gotta get rid of him.
[196:41.81]Shot it!
[196:44.47]I should've knocked him down, not up.
[196:46.04]That was my bad.
[196:53.20]Hey, we did it.
[196:54.82]Contributions all around, except for that guy Flo killed everyone and did everything.
[197:00.52]You thought by BM you thought it was Beast Mastery?
[197:07.17]Like World of Warcraft Hunter?
[197:11.69]Turn up the game music, I could do that.
[197:19.38]Is there actual music in the games though?
[197:28.56]Put the Labo music on, never again.
[197:30.24]All right, if I leave this lobby and I join another one, did I get stuck in there or is that actually the only people that are playing?
[197:43.83]Who mains Hunter?
[197:48.96]See, now there are more players.
[197:50.58]Oh yeah, I was in that game for like three hours.
[197:53.10]There's more people playing.
[198:05.99]Jesus you guys memed me and told me that there were only six people in the game This one's kind of laggy though Ooh this one's laggy.
[198:27.86]What's my ping?
[198:28.42]My ping's only 80.
[198:29.62]What the hell's going on?
[198:40.44]Now there are 23.
[198:48.91]I need something else.
[198:51.21]No.
[198:51.87]There we go.
[198:52.57]Shotgun.
[198:53.26]I don't want the boots though.
[198:54.26]Something else beside the boots.
[199:00.46]It's so unco- I turned the music up!
[199:02.26]I guess there's no in-game music.
[199:13.06]That guy blew right by me.
[199:20.14]Ooh, right ahead.
[199:22.32]Yeah, there's no ingom- ing- ingom music?
[199:32.95]That felt good.
[199:33.99]THAT felt good.
[199:51.97]Give me the range.
[199:52.65]I need.
[199:58.53]Stuff him.
[199:59.05]Stuff him.
[200:03.90]That was almost a stuff job, but not quite.
[200:17.08]Not enough.
[200:18.20]Not enough.
[200:18.58]Fuck the boots.
[200:22.91]Boots are underpowered.
[200:40.03]Oh, did I get it?
[200:42.41]No.
[200:43.25]Maybe I helped.
[200:44.01]I can't tell.
[200:52.10]I'm dead.
[200:53.46]Fuck.
[200:56.45]Hog champ?
[200:57.19]Question mark.
[200:57.73]That might- I- Maybe.
[200:58.61]I don't know.
[201:02.01]Got it.
[201:10.30]Holy fuck, man.
[201:11.12]Did I seriously- What- What did I- Goddamn mine.
[201:13.62]I panicked with that fucking thing.
[201:41.02]Did I do it?
[201:42.12]Oh, come on.
[201:43.50]No.
[201:45.06]No, he's still here.
[201:48.98]I'm like losing my touch here.
[201:50.52]I'm not grappling when I get knocked off.
[201:54.19]I'm just being a fucking idiot.
[202:06.12]There it is.
[202:14.22]Give it to me.
[202:26.18]Did he just bounce that back?
[202:46.17]Dammit.
[202:47.05]Thought I could get it.
[202:49.89]It's all right.
[202:50.35]We're good.
[202:52.88]One man mod spam.
[202:57.08]Too many links.
[203:05.04]How long have we been streaming for?
[203:06.90]I'll go for another 30 or 40 minutes.
[203:14.33]And then we'll be back on Tuesday.
[203:18.04]To do the blind... The blind game.
[203:22.60]Called a blind legend.
[203:27.14]Show the emote results.
[203:28.34]You got it.
[203:30.76]Those are the five winners of the emote contest.
[203:32.52]And then the link is for you to pick your favorite one of these ten.
[203:35.44]Because these other... Ones are going to be coming in as well.
[203:46.40]There you are.
[203:47.64]That's the link that's being spammed.
[203:50.30]Make sure you get in on it.
[203:56.83]I vote for none of them.
[203:58.21]Well, you don't have to vote.
[203:58.95]It's not an obligation.
[204:03.77]It is not an obligation to vote.
[204:05.67]Just there if you want to.
[204:18.07]Not enough.
[204:20.03]Might be though.
[204:27.61]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[204:29.39]No way.
[204:31.69]Did he actually survive that?
[204:33.93]I'm shocked.
[204:35.23]No, I got him.
[204:35.93]Holy fuck, that would have been amazing if he lived.
[204:37.49]Is he still attached to me?
[205:00.69]Give me a new gun.
[205:05.08]Ah, I wasn't looking.
[205:06.16]Fuck.
[205:09.79]We need music?
[205:10.41]I don't know why it's not playing.
[205:11.33]It should be.
[205:29.67]Nope, not gonna get him.
[205:36.98]That's what I want.
[205:37.70]Machine pistol.
[205:39.46]You're good, you're a teammate.
[205:41.46]Yeah.
[205:51.05]See you later.
[205:57.85]Almost was very bad.
[205:59.81]Almost.
[206:00.59]Key word there.
[206:13.93]Oh my god.
[206:14.71]At least I got him.
[206:15.39]At least I got him.
[206:16.69]That would have sucked.
[206:28.46]I love the revolver, it's the best weapon.
[206:30.22]It's the most fun.
[206:30.68]Not cl- aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[207:00.55]Where the hell did he go?
[207:02.39]Uh, we already got a bunch of planets.
[207:03.55]You know, people maybe want to see some new shit.
[207:05.23]Let's try to bury him.
[207:13.15]There's too many places to...
[207:39.72]Oh, he wasn't ready for that.
[207:41.60]That was a bad place to teleport.
[207:46.39]Shit.
[207:54.13]No weapon.
[207:55.63]I'm okay with the hand cannon.
[207:56.62]Just gotta aim down at some dudes.
[207:59.42]No.
[208:01.94]Not down at myself, though.
[208:03.10]That was bad.
[208:03.58]Bad.
[208:07.84]Bad.
[208:15.38]Losing their mind over this thing to get out of the way.
[208:17.04]I like this combo No fucking coming for me
[208:58.73]Point.
[209:00.15]Good game.
[209:03.19]Do it one more time.
[209:04.31]64.
[209:04.93]Okay, we're good.
[209:07.37]You missed the helicopter.
[209:08.25]Alright, let's put on some... We'll put on background music.
[209:17.24]How about... Relaxing song.
[209:31.42]50 songs, chill out, and spa music.
[209:40.71]This is just Firewatch.
[209:42.87]What a game that was.
[209:47.85]I can't see you.
[209:49.56]I'm looking at you right now.
[209:52.58]Should I go over here and pick up the wood?
[209:55.08]That's what we're supposed to do, I think.
[209:56.92]Okay.
[209:58.78]Hey, is there a point to this whole game?
[210:00.82]No.
[210:01.90]We actually would lead up to the fact that there's a huge, huge thing to talk about.
[210:06.27]Big conspiracy.
[210:08.09]The game does nothing here.
[210:10.57]Really?
[210:11.83]Oh, man.
[210:12.21]Well, should I have returned the game?
[210:14.85]Yeah, you should have returned the game after about two hours.
[210:18.49]I'm just kidding.
[210:26.85]I played through Firewatch and hated it.
[210:39.00]Yeah, this is just like an instrumental of... Let it be.
[210:43.54]Now, Firewatch was a fine game.
[210:51.26]Except for the, you know, the whole... Never mind.
[210:54.14]For those of you that haven't played it.
[210:57.08]It was great.
[211:00.28]The whole game was great.
[211:02.07]I think they just fumbled the story in the end zone.
[211:04.49]That's all I think.
[211:14.99]Watch out for him This could be every song whatever song you want this to be that's the song it is
[211:51.57]Come on, shove him up.
[211:53.61]Oh, he's... I got him.
[211:57.00]He actually didn't grab onto anything.
[212:01.87]That's how you do a fucking speed move.
[212:26.75]That enough?
[212:27.23]I feel like I said that a thousand times.
[212:29.50]That enough?
[212:30.68]No, it wasn't.
[212:33.46]That wasn't.
[212:36.26]Come on, man.
[212:38.70]Come on, man.
[212:54.93]Not if I wasn't getting tapped from behind.
[212:58.12]Not a good game.
[212:59.14]They have a good team.
[213:02.97]We got a good guy on our team.
[213:04.73]We got like four good guys.
[213:26.28]I'm getting... This is the worst game I've had in like an hour and a half.
[213:29.90]That's not good.
[213:32.31]I think the music is slowing me down.
[213:38.89]Just listening to some fucking dickhead with an acoustic guitar.
[213:41.80]Like, I went to college for four and a half years.
[213:45.26]I don't want to hear this anymore.
[213:52.71]Sorry, I'm sorry.
[213:55.19]No, this music is fun That's not enough That's gotta be enough
[214:28.50]Oh my god, fuck me.
[214:30.18]I'm off.
[214:32.70]I would have had that like five out of five times.
[214:34.62]Alright, this is just fucking porn music.
[214:45.48]I don't want that anymore.
[214:48.60]Alright, turn the music off so I can decode the game again.
[215:02.89]That would've been cool.
[215:09.07]He knows what porn music sounds like?
[215:10.93]What are you talking about?
[215:16.76]Link the music.
[215:20.22]Oh my god, he knows what porn is?
[215:23.81]That's so impossible to not know what that is by the age of... If you... Okay, on your 18th birthday.
[215:30.00]On your 20th birthday.
[215:31.08]If you don't know what internet pornography is.
[215:35.60]I feel like... I feel like you've been plugged in somewhere.
[215:39.02]And they just let you out.
[215:46.19]What is it?
[215:49.33]Wikipedia article that.
[215:50.41]You'll find out what it is.
[215:53.72]Is this a family-friendly stream?
[215:55.80]It is.
[215:59.14]Parents have to have the talk with their kids.
[216:00.52]What do you think we're doing right now?
[216:06.59]So... What happens is... When a man... A woman... A man and a man, woman, woman, don't matter.
[216:14.95]When people love each other... And they pray hard enough... What happens is... They have to kiss three times...
[216:22.84]And after the third kiss, they roll a set of dice.
[216:29.74]And I cannot give you a bit and play this game.
[216:32.00]It requires way too much of my brain.
[216:34.29]I was going to make a thing where the stork comes and... I can't even do it.
[216:39.43]There's no way.
[216:41.83]This game requires 1000% concentration.
[216:44.09]You ain't going to get anything from me here tonight.
[216:48.28]No funny stork joke tonight.
[216:54.01]And then, like, the stork... What does the stork do?
[217:04.95]Look it up.
[217:07.63]It's two storks that end up having sex with each other.
[217:11.47]And then they deliver a baby to your door.
[217:13.93]There's always a stork baby, by the way.
[217:15.63]Alright, I can't.
[217:25.04]Maybe in a different game.
[217:33.33]I'm glad I got that guy because of his name.
[217:34.91]I don't have any mines?
[217:43.76]What?
[217:58.13]That should have knocked him down, right?
[217:59.11]I think so.
[218:04.86]I think.
[218:13.78]Knock him down.
[218:16.30]Dude, I don't even care.
[218:17.26]Knock him down.
[218:17.72]I don't even care.
[218:21.68]He's protected.
[218:30.71]Should I go for the car insurance lady?
[218:38.33]Should be enough, right?
[218:46.15]Guys, the person's name is Flo.
[218:50.21]Ah, fuck me.
[218:54.82]Why did he follow me up there?
[218:59.60]I don't want this gun.
[219:12.92]Got it, come on.
[219:25.90]Too much popcorn over here.
[219:27.84]I'm gonna hold on to this thing.
[219:46.62]Yes he is.
[219:47.77]Yes he is.
[219:56.74]Oh yeah!
[220:01.58]That was tough.
[220:11.82]This is a bad place to go, all the way up here.
[220:13.60]It's so easy to get sniped.
[220:15.64]I'm on top of this guy.
[220:28.04]I'm just flinging myself off the map.
[220:29.44]There we go, that's what I want.
[220:43.70]Get ready to die, Jupiter.
[220:45.02]Well, you want me to play Let's Get Ready to Die?
[220:46.84]What's that song?
[220:47.44]What's that song?
[220:49.94]Let's Get Ready to Die by the Mighty Mighty Boss Stones?
[220:53.02]What is it?
[220:54.80]No, that's Andrew WK.
[221:06.51]Is that enough?
[221:11.26]I'll play the Mighty Mighty Boss Stones instead.
[221:12.82]That's much better.
[221:23.29]Thanks for the recommendation, guys.
[221:27.33]No, I can't play this yet.
[221:27.97]We're not in the game yet.
[221:28.73]Alright, we'll say one more round and then we'll call it.
[221:39.72]This game is very fun, though.
[221:42.32]I'm enjoying it.
[221:43.60]New hat.
[221:44.68]This one.
[221:46.10]Sure.
[221:51.16]Let's get it.
[221:58.93]15 seconds.
[222:07.79]Here we go.
[222:14.83]You know, I remember a field trip I went on in the ninth grade or so.
[222:18.57]I listened to this whole CD like five or six times in a row on their way there and on the way back.
[222:26.00]It was like an hour and 12 minutes, which means I'm a liar because the whole album is probably less than an hour.
[222:36.24]So let's just say twice.
[222:51.83]What's going on?
[223:10.02]Bury.
[223:10.58]Come on, bury him.
[223:14.52]Come on, I gotta go to E3.
[223:16.70]Shootmania Storm Tournament.
[223:17.88]I have to win.
[223:27.78]I never had to knock on wood But I never wanted to have
[223:51.57]I can't play with music like this.
[223:54.24]I really can't.
[223:55.76]It hits the same cortex center of my brain that is everything else.
[224:02.24]It's like somebody's screaming in my face.
[224:04.40]I swear to God.
[224:09.23]Is that like a real disorder?
[224:10.61]Where if I hear sounds, I can't concentrate?
[224:13.97]What is it called?
[224:17.73]It's like blocking out the centers of my brain that are to pay attention.
[224:31.37]That's gotta be enough.
[224:46.79]Well, it probably would be ADD, wouldn't it?
[224:48.83]I have ADD.
[224:49.29]I have everything.
[224:54.03]I was in a class of my own because of so many learning disabilities I had.
[224:58.44]Like, school sucked.
[225:07.96]It's like, true.
[225:16.09]Come here, come here, come here.
[225:20.90]Where's he going?
[225:21.36]Around the corner?
[225:31.36]Still positive, though.
[225:32.18]I don't know what this is.
[225:42.19]Why is this playing?
[225:43.41]Why are the spin doctors playing right now?
[225:46.36]I mean, I'm not gonna complain, but why are they playing?
[225:51.93]Fucking spin doctors.
[225:58.19]Play Jimmy Eat World.
[226:15.06]It's gonna play whatever it's gonna play apparently I didn't get that
[226:47.63]I can't even understand what he's saying.
[226:49.61]I don't wanna... What's he saying?
[226:51.91]Get over here.
[226:53.15]No, I didn't pull him.
[226:54.71]Okay, I gotta turn this off before I die.
[227:21.65]All right, one more.
[227:22.57]A nice school assembly song.
[227:34.59]Let's do another one.
[227:42.94]I'm addicted to the game.
[227:43.80]Yeah.
[227:44.24]Yeah, I am.
[228:04.88]Oh, it's a tornado level.
[228:05.72]I'm alright.
[228:06.28]I can do this one.
[228:16.45]You've been playing this for hours and you still suck.
[228:20.09]I've been second place pretty much every single time.
[228:25.27]With the exception of a few.
[228:27.31]So, what are you talking about?
[228:29.63]I'd like to know.
[228:33.48]What are you on about?
[228:44.97]What am I doing?
[229:05.30]Fuck.
[229:07.10]How did that even happen?
[229:08.65]What the fuck?
[229:18.08]Did I get him in?
[229:18.60]I got him in.
[229:19.22]Good.
[229:23.83]Get in the tornado.
[229:28.23]I think he's still stuck in there, right?
[229:30.37]Seems like it.
[229:43.36]Whoa!
[229:45.16]Right at the edge.
[229:51.33]I hate this thing.
[229:51.83]Get it off.
[229:52.13]Damn it.
[230:06.14]He's got the lightning bolt thing.
[230:07.18]I'm fucked.
[230:19.43]Don't let him back up.
[230:34.99]I get hit by it every time.
[230:41.11]Get these boots off, please.
[231:01.45]I'm dead.
[231:19.69]I'll keep the booster.
[231:43.22]I'm trying.
[231:48.10]Knock him in.
[231:50.57]Where'd he go?
[231:56.28]Is there damage percent?
[231:57.12]No.
[231:57.80]Everything just has a set amount of damage it does.
[231:59.74]I don't think there are actual percentages in the game.
[232:07.90]So to speak.
[232:16.65]Guy's got the electric thing.
[232:31.35]Dammit, no!
[232:31.89]Got it.
[232:45.27]Play of the game.
[232:57.36]Into the- yeah, there we go.
[232:58.64]Into the tornado.
[233:05.07]Holy fuck, why did that do so much?
[233:08.01]Alright, that's it.
[233:29.31]Second place?
[233:30.90]No, first place this time.
[233:39.09]I failed you, Dad?
[233:40.03]What?
[233:48.05]One more song?
[233:48.99]No, that's it.
[233:50.57]That's it.
[233:58.11]I'm gonna show the emotes one more time.
[234:01.43]And then I'm gonna go.
[234:05.61]Pick these.
[234:06.57]They're the winners.
[234:17.25]So I think I'm going to leave.
[234:21.07]No, I think this is a good indicator, I think.
[234:26.68]What do you guys think?
[234:27.18]Should I leave it up?
[234:28.52]Hold until Tuesday?
[234:30.64]One more day?
[234:37.74]Probably now, then.
[234:41.32]Yeah, this is a good indicator, I think.
[234:53.86]Alright, yeah.
[234:54.86]Let's call it here.
[234:57.70]Because this was just like an added bonus, right?
[235:01.28]Yeah, Strawpole is too easy to fuck with.
[235:03.03]It's true.
[235:05.41]Alright, so.
[235:08.47]The new emotes are these ones.
[235:12.31]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[235:13.25]They'll be there on Tuesday.
[235:15.25]Or as quickly as I can contact everybody, right?
[235:19.87]Fireman.
[235:21.45]Venus.
[235:22.77]Chomp TV and Heart are the other five emotes.
[235:30.27]Fireman Venus, Chomp TV and Heart.
[235:40.01]Thank you all for participating in the final bonus.
[235:46.91]These will all be added
[235:52.73]And by the way, all the people that won, I'll contact you on Discord.
[235:58.09]The mods can help me with it, too.
[236:01.43]You're going to get your choice of $50 in Steam or $50 in Amazon gift card.
[236:06.54]Thank you, everybody.
[236:09.66]That was a lot of fun.
[236:10.92]Hope you guys enjoyed that.
[236:14.82]One last hurrah.
[236:19.52]There it is.
[236:22.03]And with that, I will see you guys on Tuesday for the Blind Legend.
[236:29.28]I'm actually really looking forward to that stream.
[236:31.86]That's going to be a lot of fun.
[236:36.66]So, there are your winners.
[236:39.72]You'll be able to use them very, very soon.
[236:43.74]So let's do the credits.
[236:47.26]Final thoughts on Sky Noon?
[236:48.50]I think it's great.
[236:54.98]I could have probably sat there and played for a lot longer.
[237:00.32]But time is of the essence, right?
[237:06.66]It's 15 bucks on Steam right now.
[237:12.39]But let's do the credits.
[237:13.47]See you guys on Tuesday for the Facecam Blind Legend stream.

[240:23.95]Isn't he precious pretending to read?
[240:25.75]I can read.
[240:26.51]All right, let's do it.
[240:33.49]Thank you, Dark Star, for the $1.
[240:34.89]Oh boy, I hope Jerva, that's a picture of my asshole emote wins.
[240:41.65]Sky Noon is down to five players.
[240:43.51]That's unfortunate.
[240:50.15]Thank you, Dark Star.
[240:51.49]Thank you, Hall of One Zombie, for the $1.
[240:53.33]You should fill your pockets with yogurt.
[240:55.85]That way you always have a tasty snack if you're on the go.
[240:59.77]Uh, Go-Gurt, man.
[241:01.81]Those things are made for kids in middle school, but... They exist.
[241:09.28]Uh, The Reaper of Memes, thanks for the $1.
[241:11.16]Still an N-O-W-O-Late-O, I see.
[241:16.58]That level don't even exist.
[241:18.80]Dark Star.
[241:19.36]Again, thanks for the $1.
[241:20.36]This game looks so fucking rad.
[241:21.98]I hope the game doesn't take a turn for the worse by the time you read bits.
[241:24.69]No.
[241:27.45]It did not.
[241:28.09]It actually... I didn't... Here's the thing.
[241:30.37]I didn't like it at first.
[241:31.21]I thought it was a little too much.
[241:34.05]But after a couple hours, you just start to figure out how the game actually is intended to be played.
[241:39.95]It's a lot more fun.
[241:42.03]You just need to give it a few hours.
[241:43.23]Give it some time.
[241:43.81]It takes a while to learn new shit, man.
[241:46.73]It's very fun.
[241:50.21]So four hours later, yeah.
[241:51.41]I still think it's good.
[241:53.65]Donajello, thanks for the $2.50.
[241:54.89]Looking forward to those new emotes, Jer.
[241:58.49]Me too.
[242:04.06]I can't wait to see how they are utilized.
[242:06.72]MostlyLost, thanks for the $1.
[242:08.00]Calling it now.
[242:08.44]He's going to get engrossed in this and it'll be like two and a half hours before we see the emotes.
[242:14.65]Kind of true.
[242:15.39]That was sort of accurate.
[242:18.35]I spammed next game.
[242:20.11]Sorry.
[242:25.41]Whatever.
[242:27.13]I can't fight it at this point, can I?
[242:31.12]How do I combat that?
[242:32.80]When I look over in the chat and I see, like, next game sucks, fuck this.
[242:36.74]What am I supposed to do?
[242:39.25]Just turn off the stream?
[242:42.53]No, I can't.
[242:43.51]I can't.
[242:56.08]Make joke.
[243:01.27]You're supposed to play Minecraft.
[243:05.03]Turn on emote only.
[243:06.09]Yeah, but I don't want to do that, though.
[243:08.93]I don't want to turn on, like, sub only, emote only.
[243:13.73]Come on.
[243:17.81]Tell chat to stop it.
[243:19.69]I lashed out at chat two days ago.
[243:22.13]If you weren't here.
[243:33.51]why because I was doing the nintendo labo and they all hated it and I was just like let me have this I'm just trying to play the game and I may have said to s the f up I may have said it I said I said I said s the f up they broke me yeah they they broke me in half like an egg
[244:10.77]Yeah, I told them to shush the frick up.
[244:19.49]Why am I censoring the word shut?
[244:24.84]Well, because of the shorts.
[244:25.92]I don't know if it's the heat, man.
[244:31.34]We're in like the middle of August, right?
[244:33.40]Is it just too hot and people just need something to lash out against now?
[244:41.06]I feel like the winter slows chat's bones down.
[244:43.40]It makes him type slower.
[244:59.92]It's cold as shit.
[245:03.56]People are hot and bothered.
[245:09.35]The heat made... What about my bones?
[245:15.58]Your bones are fine.
[245:16.26]Don't worry.
[245:20.32]Anyways, let's keep going.
[245:25.15]Thank you to dinner.
[245:30.81]Shit, that was 25 cents.
[245:32.01]Fuck.
[245:33.35]Thanks, though, man.
[245:35.34]Twitter.
[245:35.66]Twitter.
[245:36.40]Twitter.
[245:37.61]A spec tag, thanks for the $1.
[245:39.21]Just an idea.
[245:39.85]You could replace German Mustard with one of the emotes from the contests.
[245:43.31]It's embarrassingly bad.
[245:47.99]No, I can't.
[245:48.86]You can't win.
[245:49.62]Don't you understand?
[245:52.66]The people will revolt.
[245:55.76]I will never see the end of that.
[245:58.02]If I delete German Mustard right now, it will be the only thing you see in the chat for the next full year.
[246:08.67]Guys, I deleted the Next emote.
[246:12.31]And that shit just in text pops up every day.
[246:19.31]I didn't even accomplish anything when I deleted Next.
[246:25.85]I made one joke where we were going to say Next playing an iPad compilation of games.
[246:33.46]And it's been the bane of my entire streaming existence since then.
[246:46.38]Next was super annoying at its height.
[246:49.96]Yeah, there was a Next emote.
[246:50.90]I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
[246:58.10]It was some crappy No Man's Sky ripoff that broke you to delete Next.
[247:02.32]Really?
[247:02.64]What was the game?
[247:10.33]The lesson is don't ever say anything.
[247:13.43]Does anyone remember what the game was?
[247:19.04]Was it Spore?
[247:19.70]No, it wasn't Spore, I don't think.
[247:20.94]Subnautica.
[247:28.93]Don't people like Subnautica?
[247:31.25]You guys are going to throw a line out to me here, okay?
[247:37.24]So if I play a game, it's like damned if you do, damned if you don't.
[247:42.38]Jerma, why don't you play a game and just play it and relax and have fun on stream?
[247:46.21]You don't have to keep playing a different game every single time.
[247:50.31]If I play a game that I like to play, that I'm just enjoying, it's like, whoa, get this fucking out of here!
[247:57.65]But then, if I don't play a game that I like, or if I don't continue to play the same game, it's like, dude, I really wish you would fucking play the same game once in a while, like just play a game for fun on stream.
[248:09.36]Why don't you do that?
[248:13.41]It's like both sides just scream at each other.
[248:16.35]It's like, oh, you should play Subnautica.
[248:26.11]Oh, that would be great if he played Subnautica.
[248:27.76]Subnautica, what a great game.
[248:29.32]Wait, did he play it more than one time?
[248:31.08]Hey!
[248:33.28]You're not supposed to play this more than once!
[248:35.26]Get this out of here!
[248:37.74]Next, motherfucker!
[248:40.86]Like, what do you want?
[248:41.50]What am I supposed to do?
[248:46.27]Like, what the fuck am I gonna do here?
[248:51.19]And then, like, the next day, Jeremiah, you know, I would really appreciate it if you just fucking enjoyed a game and played it on stream.
[248:58.55]You know, I really miss when you used to do that.
[249:02.20]Enter.
[249:02.96]Let's see what he does.
[249:11.92]Yeah, I was typing on my desk.
[249:13.52]I wasn't even typing on my keyboard.
[249:29.49]Jeremiah enter is a new.
[249:31.77]Oh my God.
[249:41.98]But I'm obviously like kidding around half kidding, but I hope you see it from my perspective.
[249:50.62]You know, put yourself in the streamer shoes and then press enter.
[250:01.84]Anyways, thank you to Garfield the Monday Killer for $1.
[250:11.25]Holy lasagna larping lizards, Batman.
[250:13.41]It's Jerma985.
[250:14.29]I know we like to have fun here on the Garfield Bit Bonanza.
[250:18.59]But let's bring it down, boys.
[250:19.83]Yeah, settle down there, Odster.
[250:22.23]He's a joker, that guy.
[250:23.99]Anyway, German, all of us down here in chat like donating to you and telling you how much you changed our lives because you never get inflated by it.
[250:30.29]You funnel the good vibes right back into your streams.
[250:33.03]And the final product is Garftastic.
[250:36.27]You say we spoil you, but you're the one spoiling us.
[250:38.11]Thanks, Jax.
[250:40.19]Thank you, Garfield.
[250:41.51]The Monday Killer.
[250:43.65]Appreciate it.
[250:45.77]That means a lot.
[250:51.89]Hopefully, you continue to enjoy yourself.
[250:57.25]Stay tuned.
[251:00.18]Shoot Man.
[251:00.68]Thank you, Shoot Man, for the $1.
[251:01.74]Jerma has a smooth rat brain, and that's why I love him.
[251:05.76]Thank you.
[251:07.12]Brandon 201 back again.
[251:08.28]Thanks for the $1.
[251:09.01]Hey, Jerma, how's Uncle Lou?
[251:11.51]5 out of 5,000.
[251:13.87]He's doing great.
[251:16.61]He's been really into building shit with popsicle sticks.
[251:18.79]I don't know why.
[251:21.63]Just Elmer's glue in old popsicle sticks.
[251:23.98]He keeps calling me.
[251:25.90]Asking me if I'll eat more popsicles and send them to him.
[251:29.80]Because he can't do it all on his own.
[251:31.48]And I did it for like four or five boxes.
[251:33.22]And you can't have that many popsicles and fudgicles and stuff, man.
[251:36.64]I can't do it.
[251:37.08]He keeps asking me for it.
[251:39.98]I was like, why don't you just pay somebody to eat them?
[251:43.34]But then it's like, well, you have to buy the popsicle sticks and then you have to pay somebody.
[251:47.37]And you could just like dump them all in the sink and put the water on them and just drain them all into the sink.
[251:52.33]But that's a waste of food.
[251:56.41]to go to like just to hand them out go to bring bring like 10 boxes to his school just hand them out at lunch but then you can't do that because all the parents will be upset about that because then wait you gave my kid uh you gave I get a popsicle at lunch I didn't sign off on that he has he has high cholesterol you can't do that then he can get in trouble that way it's just the whole thing the whole thing's fun
[252:27.01]Hey, thank you, Composition, for the $1.
[252:29.46]Thanks for all the goofs, Germo.
[252:30.52]It's probably been suggested on Discord, but you should play Stardew Valley multiplayer.
[252:35.14]That did just come out actually two days ago, right?
[252:42.70]We'll see about that.
[252:43.36]That sounds like fun.
[252:45.60]SnoopTable, thank you for the $50 again earlier.
[252:48.34]Thank you so much, dude.
[252:50.33]Smelly boy, thanks for the $1.
[252:51.79]They plunked Jerma's sneeze just like I said they would.
[252:55.45]Never underestimate the chat's dickheadery.
[253:07.44]I think I made this reference before, but I need to have... You guys are a bunch of bees.
[253:11.40]I need to get one of those bee smokers to calm you guys down.
[253:17.01]Those beekeepers, they just come out and they... And the bees are all freaking out.
[253:21.19]And the bees then just calm down in the smoke.
[253:24.36]I need my own chat bee smoker.
[253:36.03]It's tobacco.
[253:37.25]No, it's special beekeeping smoke.
[253:55.10]Spring bug spray.
[254:00.28]I'm gonna get the special beekeeping smoke and calm you guys down.
[254:06.49]The smoke makes them panic because they think their hive is on fire.
[254:11.13]No, the smoke calms them down.
[254:14.89]They slow down and they just chill.
[254:19.21]Hold on, I'm gonna look this up.
[254:20.35]Why does smoke make bees calm?
[254:29.60]Smoke masks alarm pheromones, which include various chemicals that are released by guard bees that are injured during a beekeeper's inspection.
[254:38.59]The smoke creates an opportunity for the beekeepers to open the beehive and work while the colony's defense response is interrupted.
[254:51.98]So when the beekeepers come in to pull the beehives out,
[254:57.62]The alarm goes off.
[254:58.68]They're just disabling the alarm.
[255:01.26]They pump in the anti-alarm bee smoke.
[255:07.49]They don't panic.
[255:12.71]You just snap the bee alarm line, and then when the smoke dissipates, it's back to normal.
[255:21.35]But anyways.
[255:23.68]Thank you, Devlon2Million, for the $1.
[255:25.37]Too many good emotes to choose from, not like this.
[255:27.93]Big ups to all the contestants for making this such a close race.
[255:31.75]Yeah.
[255:34.05]There are a lot of good ones.
[255:36.72]I think we got some good emotes, no?
[255:39.22]Not that we didn't have good emotes before, but, you know.
[255:43.00]Pineapple, thanks for the $1.
[255:44.26]Big old lemons to you, sir.
[255:45.70]Thank you, Pineapple.
[255:48.18]Megamoob, $50 earlier.
[255:51.51]Huge, huge thank you, dude.
[255:53.92]Thank you so much for the $50.
[255:58.51]Touched upon it already, but yes, I'll be building the Robot Labo next weekend.
[256:05.75]Should be fun.
[256:07.95]I recommend you go.
[256:10.36]And maybe I'll bring in fucking symbols or something to wake you up every four hours.
[256:19.90]Hold on.
[256:20.28]Wait, what does it say?
[256:22.05]Oh, there we go.
[256:24.96]Uh, Vertical, or Vertiquad, you corrected me two days ago, and I think I got it.
[256:31.93]Did I get it?
[256:33.59]Vertical?
[256:36.59]Or am I just stupid and forgot it?
[256:39.49]But anyways, Vertiquad, Vertical, thank you for the $1.
[256:43.98]Hey, German, I'm wondering... Uh, no, that's not you.
[256:47.66]Uh, thanks for showing me this game.
[256:49.86]Anything Smash Bros-esque is up my alley, and I might check this game out now.
[256:52.82]Have a good night.
[256:54.93]Thank you, Min.
[256:57.71]I highly recommend you do.
[257:00.67]Banjo Boy, thanks for the $1.
[257:02.29]Hey, Jerma, I'm wondering if you ever heard of the TV show Galavant.
[257:06.01]It's very short, it's on Netflix, and it's super funny.
[257:08.67]It's also a full-on musical, and I honestly think it's one of the best shows ever made.
[257:12.11]I think you'll like it a lot.
[257:22.49]Uh, yeah.
[257:23.81]Galavant?
[257:25.85]Let's see.
[257:28.55]Actually, it was on Netflix earlier today, so I can look it up.
[257:33.11]Thanks for the recommendation.
[257:35.92]Anna Melant, thanks for the $1, Anna Melant.
[257:41.94]Hey, Germa, watching your streams never fails to put a smile on my face, so thanks for the laughs.
[257:45.16]I was also wondering if you were going to buy Dark Souls Remastered on Switch, since getting jebaited on the toilet is just the thing I needed in my life personally.
[257:55.74]Uh, no.
[257:57.52]I already played Dark Souls Remastered on PC already, the whole thing.
[258:02.73]Enjoyed it.
[258:04.21]But I will not be getting it on the Switch.
[258:07.79]Although that's going to be great to play that portable.
[258:13.15]But thank you, dude.
[258:14.90]Banjo Boy, again, thanks for the $1.
[258:16.76]Also, thanks for playing A Blind Legend.
[258:19.32]I suggested it in the Discord, so I guess I'm finally the one guy.
[258:23.14]Even if chat thinks the game sucks, I'll just be happy that you tried it out.
[258:26.00]Keep being awesome.
[258:28.25]Yeah, one day you'll be the one guy.
[258:31.33]All of you here.
[258:32.71]Everybody in this chat one day is gonna be the one guy.
[258:37.47]Trust me on this.
[258:48.31]But yeah.
[258:50.09]I'm willing to try it.
[258:52.35]It's just different enough and just interesting enough that I feel like I can have a lot of fun playing it.
[258:58.17]Especially if I do a whole thing with the cam on.
[259:01.81]And I'll add some scenes.
[259:03.09]We'll make a couple of, you know, if a monster shows up, we'll play it.
[259:06.69]We'll put something else in the background.
[259:08.11]I'm going to do the whole nine on it.
[259:11.31]Tuesday should be a lot of fun.
[259:12.43]Don't miss it if you're available.
[259:15.81]But thank you, dude.
[259:17.38]Thank you, Peter, for the $5 here.
[259:22.64]They say, seems good, pretty cool guy.
[259:24.34]PogChamp, cool guy.
[259:25.50]Hey, thanks for the $5, Peter.
[259:31.99]P-E-E-7-R.
[259:35.59]Thanks, man.
[259:36.91]Hey, GhoulChamp, thanks for the two bucks.
[259:39.45]Uh, dude, Tachyon Death Grips.
[259:44.01]Oh, that was a music, uh,
[259:46.45]That was a music suggestion earlier.
[259:50.45]I still have not listened to any of that album.
[260:00.80]I'll listen to the whole thing tomorrow.
[260:04.06]But thank you for your suggestion.
[260:05.18]Thank you, Megamube, again, for your dollar here.
[260:08.72]And then he says, Africa by Toto, please.
[260:15.26]We're over the...
[260:18.39]music portion of the stream but thank you for the uh extra contribution from your large amount of money you're giving thank you there's gonna be a lot of these yeah there will chunky baloney thanks for the one dollar hearing earthworm jim music just makes me think of sham bam bamina oh yeah that's doug to naples little um live action skit thing that he did
[260:46.53]Is he still doing shit?
[260:47.63]Is Doug Tenable actually still making things?
[260:51.66]Or did he just get too old now?
[261:00.24]What is he up to now?
[261:06.73]Do you guys remember when I interviewed him on stream?
[261:11.85]I think a lot of people forget that happened.
[261:16.10]That is lost forever.
[261:18.78]I interviewed Doug TenNapel on camera, on stream, like three years ago.
[261:24.51]I don't know if it's gone forever.
[261:26.41]Remember he kept calling me Peter?
[261:30.23]Does anybody still, that was a YouTube stream, I think.
[261:36.40]Does anybody here remember that?
[261:52.18]don't even know who it is yeah okay it was back I did I was playing 10 million the game 10 million I'm actually surprised nobody here remembers that and he my skype name at the time was a fake name so every time I would ask him a question or he would answer a question because remember that's when army crog remember army crog
[262:22.80]That's like the first game I streamed on Twitch.
[262:24.49]I was really looking forward to it because it was the Neverhood spiritual sequel.
[262:34.00]So my name on Skype was like Peter Pumpkin Eater or something.
[262:39.32]Whatever the hell it was.
[262:41.56]Because back in the day, Skype was a piece of shit.
[262:43.82]And it would leak out all your personal information and your IP address.
[262:46.49]It was a piece of shit.
[262:47.99]So the whole time, I didn't correct him at all because I was too scared to.
[262:51.43]But I'd be like, oh, so when you were working on the clay aspect, did you ever get to a point where it was too tired or too hard to keep building?
[263:00.60]Well, Peter, yeah, actually.
[263:01.54]Let me tell you something, Pete.
[263:03.88]I just couldn't correct him.
[263:07.28]He called me Pete like seven or eight times over the interview.
[263:16.85]The Omicrog stream is on YouTube.
[263:18.18]Well, this is way before it, though.
[263:22.96]This was probably four or five months before the game came out.
[263:30.82]That's the worst lie.
[263:31.70]It's not.
[263:32.38]It's not a lie.
[263:34.46]It really isn't.
[263:35.42]Can I find this?
[263:36.56]Hold on.
[263:42.32]Let's go back to some of my old, old tweets from like six years ago.
[263:45.99]No, not that far.
[263:55.11]Let's see here.
[263:56.75]Nobody capped it.
[263:57.71]I didn't even... Did I tell anybody?
[263:59.65]Let's go to my Twitter.
[264:20.71]This happened.
[264:27.26]Search Twitter.
[264:28.22]Germo Armikrog.
[264:35.80]No.
[264:36.06]What the fuck is this?
[264:50.70]Fuck.
[264:52.67]This was not a dream.
[264:53.71]I did this.
[264:56.83]Somebody is going to remember this.
[265:02.81]Oh my god.
[265:03.43]This is going to drive me crazy.
[265:15.70]Interview with the creator of Doom.
[265:17.40]No.
[265:17.78]This is just a fucking joke from like a year ago.
[265:27.33]Oh my god.
[265:28.25]I need to find this.
[265:29.07]I'm going to spend a long time trying to find this later.
[265:36.59]It was really spur of the moment thing.
[265:38.47]He came on and... Let me check one more thing.
[265:55.76]I'm going to lose my mind over this.
[266:04.90]I'll find it.
[266:10.76]It was on YouTube.
[266:12.72]It was a YouTube stream.
[266:19.32]No, it was before I started streaming on Twitch.
[266:24.08]Whatever.
[266:24.54]I'll find it.
[266:26.73]I'll figure it out.
[266:27.61]I'm going to have to sift through my Twitter from like 2012, but I'll find it.
[266:31.35]I tweet like once a year anyways.
[266:32.95]It won't be that hard.
[266:43.64]I'll find it next room.
[266:46.22]All right.
[266:46.52]So thank you to Scripps3 for the 50 bucks.
[266:49.58]Appreciate it, man.
[266:50.30]Thank you so much.
[266:53.50]Gmegon, thanks for the $1.

[266:56.59]We already did.
[266:57.09]The song requests.
[266:58.05]Thank you for your suggestion.
[267:01.69]Handsbeats, thanks for the $1.
[267:02.81]Are you going to stream Dark Souls 2?
[267:07.50]No.
[267:08.52]Probably not.
[267:09.98]I'm over the Souls games for now.
[267:13.40]We'll see what happens when the new FromSoftware game comes out.
[267:19.30]Wait.
[267:19.66]People have already found it in chat.
[267:20.96]I have to link on tab.
[267:26.26]I don't see it.
[267:36.51]I don't see it.
[267:38.32]It's not going to be a Rickroll.
[267:39.22]I'm okay for you to click it.
[267:42.00]Thank you to StickRenegade for the $1.
[267:43.54]Now you have three things I want you to do.
[267:46.83]Did you find it?
[267:50.91]Okay.
[267:52.09]Back from PAX.
[267:52.93]Expect an adventure video with some cool interviews tomorrow.
[267:59.41]Is this it?
[267:59.79]This is not it.
[268:12.81]No, I don't want to click on random shit right now.
[268:15.30]Hold on.
[268:22.16]Nobody found it.
[268:23.24]They found the stream.
[268:31.61]I'm not going to get gnomed.
[268:37.81]Enhance.
[268:41.32]Whatever, I'll find it.
[268:45.12]There was a Steam discussion link.
[268:52.32]Was there?
[268:52.68]Yes, there was.
[269:02.17]I missed it.
[269:13.52]Hold on.
[269:18.77]There it is.
[269:19.21]This plate, yeah, he was, if you see his reaction to the stream, Mark, he already streamed it.
[269:31.95]He's right.
[269:33.57]Yeah, right.
[269:34.07]What is this?
[269:41.55]That's not correct.
[269:43.35]German 95.
[269:44.15]Nice.
[269:47.99]This is not even, this doesn't say anything.
[269:56.38]Somebody got it.
[270:03.92]Well, I think somebody said they got it.
[270:07.97]No, it's not that.
[270:13.19]This is some real conspiracy shit.
[270:16.89]Found it, but I can't link it.
[270:20.21]Stop linking that 900, 800.
[270:21.99]It's not that one.
[270:33.70]It's not... No, it's not that.
[270:37.10]No, that's not it either.
[270:44.77]All right, that's enough.
[270:46.35]That's enough.
[270:49.24]Thank you to... I need to play Death Grips now.
[270:53.02]In my opinion, you should play Full Moon, Guillotine, or Tachyon.
[270:56.86]Add to the list of things to do.
[270:59.16]I will figure this out.
[271:00.70]Malcolm in the Middle, thanks for the $1.
[271:01.92]Gotta agree with Styx here.
[271:05.73]Death Grips.
[271:08.15]I'll hear it.
[271:10.13]We need closure.
[271:11.17]Just give me one second.
[271:13.82]Let me go back to my DMs from like fucking three years ago.
[271:16.18]Do they still exist?
[271:20.29]No.
[271:23.05]Fuck me.
[271:24.88]This actually happened.
[271:30.41]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[271:31.95]Welcome to episode one of Germacraft.
[271:35.49]I'm just going to let this fucking play the whole time.
[271:38.06]This is going to be a single player Let's Play.
[271:40.82]And when I say Let's Play, I use that term pretty loosely because I'm an idiot in this game.
[271:46.94]You're going to see lots of fails.
[271:48.12]You're going to see lots of triumphs.
[271:51.43]So go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, a hot cup of cocoa.
[271:55.01]I got apple cider right here, freshly brewed.
[271:57.01]Let me take a sip.
[271:58.99]Thank you to... Alright, so let's get this started.
[272:04.70]Create new world.
[272:06.17]Where are we?
[272:06.93]World name is going to be...
[272:10.74]Thank you to 10379 for the $1.
[272:12.42]That was the same exact person I just read.
[272:15.86]I told you guys I can't do it.
[272:18.13]You understand this is real.
[272:19.73]My brain can't listen and talk.
[272:21.21]Darkstar7000, thanks for the $1.
[272:24.53]How dare you insult Dancing Queen.
[272:27.05]It's the second best song of the 90s.
[272:29.70]Only surpassed by Thank You For The Music.
[272:32.66]Killcode, thanks for the $1.
[272:34.48]Thank you for picking up my emote as one of your personal favorites.
[272:37.29]It's so cool to see Fireman get this far.
[272:39.55]Look at that dude.
[272:40.81]Look at that dude.
[272:42.23]That was a great job, dude.
[272:43.31]Thank you, Killcode, so much for your incredible contributions to the stream.
[272:51.87]Bunga bingo.
[272:53.58]Thank you for the $15.
[272:54.88]Great new world.
[272:55.50]Let's do it, guys.
[272:56.12]Subulawa sound effects, please.
[272:58.54]Oh, my God.
[272:59.22]This is so exciting.
[273:00.26]This is episode one.
[273:02.41]No sound effects.
[273:03.55]Where are we going to end up?
[273:05.31]Thank you so much for your $15.
[273:06.19]I don't even know what Subulawa is.
[273:09.09]I really appreciate that, dude.
[273:10.20]Thank you so much for the $15.
[273:11.30]Thank you, PrimeVino, for the $2.
[273:12.42]Where the hell am I?
[273:13.56]Thanks for the $2, man.
[273:14.46]What kind of Dark Souls clone is this?
[273:16.52]Dark Souls Polar.
[273:17.74]Smelly Boy, thanks for the $1.
[273:19.98]This is so sad.
[273:20.70]Alexa, play Helicopter Sounds.
[273:23.48]Super Seal, thanks for the $1.
[273:24.60]Hello, Jeremy, it's me again, a fellow scientist.
[273:26.26]What are your thoughts on scientists successfully transferring lab-grown lungs into pigs?
[273:29.92]That sounds awesome.
[273:32.30]Because eventually, that will happen to people humans will be able to handle that and take it in two.
[273:40.53]So they eventually will be able to grow as people and deal with illnesses and diseases better.
[273:48.58]Thank you.
[273:48.92]Mostly lost for the $1.
[273:49.40]Fun fact, Kim is hosting a Talos.
[273:50.20]Instead of me.
[273:58.29]I think she has auto-hosting set on for not me.
[274:04.46]Whatever.
[274:06.82]Thank you, BanjoBoy, for the $1.
[274:08.34]One more thing.
[274:08.80]What was the name of the banjo song used in your Big Rigs video?
[274:12.76]I've tried to find it forever, but I have no idea what it's called.
[274:14.95]Banjo?
[274:15.95]This tweet.
[274:16.43]We're going to tweet here.
[274:17.65]There it is.
[274:17.97]We got it.
[274:25.31]Exclusive interview with Dr. David about his new game.
[274:27.25]I need you to contact me offline.
[274:28.77]That would be great.
[274:29.29]DM me.
[274:29.77]PM sent.
[274:30.45]Did it.
[274:30.87]See?
[274:31.13]There's your proof from 2012.
[274:31.83]Look at this little quaint little place.
[274:35.28]Oh, Jeremy, shut up.
[274:36.48]I can't handle it anymore.
[274:37.60]I love it already.
[274:39.14]Actually, I like this video.
[274:40.42]This is a good video.
[274:41.82]All righty.
[274:43.23]Thank you, Droxophilia, for the $1.
[274:44.81]I'm so stupid.
[274:45.77]It's 2021.
[274:46.41]He's still in Anor Londo.
[274:48.29]This is why I'm an idiot, guys.
[274:49.61]You see, why would I... I don't know what the name of the Banjo song was, though, Banjo.
[274:53.19]And I just jumped off the... Although your name would say that it wants to be there.
[274:57.49]I don't even know anything.
[274:58.75]I have no idea.
[275:00.07]Icky Snake, thanks for the $1.
[275:02.62]Jeremy, when are you going to give us the origin story behind Benjamin Human's patented Mayan treasure dance moves?
[275:07.62]Let me take a sip of my apple cider.
[275:11.17]Oh, that's good stuff.
[275:12.95]Hopefully you guys picked up a thing of cocoa like I told you to, because that's the most relaxing thing in the world, sitting down, playing video games.
[275:22.35]Doesn't get much better than that.
[275:25.75]Come on, now.
[275:28.18]Ooh, we got sand, too.
[275:30.82]Now, explain this to me, alright?
[275:32.50]I want Notch to send me a personal email and explain to me why there are cows that are acting like mountain lions.
[275:40.23]Why?
[275:40.53]Why would they like that?
[275:41.27]I gotta get through this.
[275:50.47]Uh, the dance moves origin story was he moved around with his hips and he thought it was fun.
[275:55.23]Fantastic, Phoenix.
[275:56.59]Thanks for the $10.
[275:57.13]Hey, German, could you please add German Neptune?
[276:00.11]I think it's the best email.
[276:00.83]We already went through this.
[276:01.81]Thank you so much, dude.
[276:02.43]Really appreciate that.
[276:03.03]Is that real?
[276:03.45]Is there another one before this?
[276:04.33]There was another one before this.
[276:18.02]At least that's what I'm pretending that I'm gonna say.
[276:20.75]Pause that.
[276:22.83]There's another one before that.
[276:27.03]Episode one's not actually episode one.
[276:33.97]That was a stream, maybe?
[276:35.15]Oh, okay.
[276:38.35]Here's the original.
[276:39.05]Okay, that.
[276:46.51]Got some wood.
[276:47.69]Oh, I got Gino still from Mario RPG, one of the best games of all time.
[276:52.26]That's true.
[276:53.24]I will agree with that.
[276:54.08]Although probably not the best game of all time.
[276:57.12]Give me the real one.
[276:59.24]Does anybody have the original one?
[277:09.66]I've been looking for it.
[277:10.46]It's gone.
[277:12.66]Does this still exist?
[277:14.64]Hold on.
[277:14.92]Now that we're talking about old, dumb videos.
[277:17.58]Does the Witcher 2 first episode exist?
[277:19.74]Did I delete it?
[277:35.64]Is this unlisted on my channel?
[277:36.78]I will log in to see.
[277:43.57]Hold on.
[277:47.20]I wonder if this is unlisted on my channel.
[277:50.22]Give me a minute here, guys.
[277:53.87]I want to see if episode one of Germacraft, the original, is on here.
[277:58.59]Let's see.
[278:01.35]Video is... Okay, unlisted.
[278:08.25]More private, maybe?
[278:09.09]Okay, unlisted.
[278:20.36]Come on, there's a lot of Modern Warfare 3 videos here.
[278:27.48]Almost all of my unlisted videos are Modern Warfare 3 videos.
[278:37.65]Okay, what about private?
[278:45.42]I have a CSGO stream here.
[278:50.58]Let's open this.
[278:52.62]TF2 CS GO.
[278:56.05]Private video.
[279:11.37]What's going on in my room?
[279:16.67]This is so laggy.
[279:17.55]Actually, you know what?
[279:18.51]If some of you guys will notice...
[279:20.71]I have quick switch on now.
[279:23.85]I'm not using the regular non-quick switch anymore.
[279:31.91]That's really old.
[279:33.03]Because I can do stuff like this.
[279:35.19]See how I switched that?
[279:36.07]Because I got a button on my thumb now.
[279:39.92]This mic sucks.
[279:42.00]I can use the button on my thumb to... What else we got?
[279:45.30]A weapon I would like to see in Team Fortress is a... Wait, hold on.
[279:51.82]What is it?
[279:52.24]What do you want?
[279:52.80]Elaborate.
[279:53.34]Let's see what else I predicted in this game.
[279:55.88]Let's have this display.
[279:56.78]Okay, thank you to
[280:21.29]Just release it right now.
[280:22.77]Yeah, this is supposed to be CS go.
[280:25.19]Where's the CS go?
[280:25.85]Oh, it's right here I am sorry.
[280:26.81]It's like unloaded a clip on you.
[280:29.58]Well, they take a long time to reload.
[280:33.96]Oh
[280:51.02]These things take a long time to reload.
[280:52.72]I'm going to be fair about this one, though.
[280:55.62]This is... Bang.
[280:58.43]I can't put it on stream because I'm only logged into YouTube on my phone.
[281:01.67]I can't get it on my desktop.
[281:02.81]I have no idea what the password is.
[281:07.25]Bang.
[281:09.21]I actually like these.
[281:11.49]Look, I'm going to be fair to myself.
[281:12.83]CSGO had just released.
[281:17.28]This is the release of CSGO.
[281:21.58]I'm playing it years later.
[281:28.25]How did I end the stream?
[281:29.09]Let's see.
[281:35.43]Let's see how this ends.
[281:46.05]How come these are all just bots?
[281:48.67]I just went to quick match.
[281:49.91]It's all like I said, please play with bots only.
[281:55.13]I just went to quick match.
[281:57.15]Oh, guys, I'm in first place.
[281:58.67]I don't understand.
[282:06.62]You know what?
[282:07.18]I kind of want to just die.
[282:08.50]Let's try to team kill everybody.
[282:11.36]Oh, this is going to be funny.
[282:13.00]Oh, I can't wait to see how funny this is, man.
[282:16.08]Do any of those guys have grenades?
[282:17.94]I hope they do.
[282:21.46]I just went so hot.
[282:23.60]Alright, let's see.
[282:25.00]I just dropped a grenade and blew up.
[282:26.70]I thought that was that funny.
[282:28.06]Where are the hostages?
[282:30.54]Why does this cut off so... This cuts off pretty abruptly, I think.
[282:39.03]How does this end?
[282:39.63]I didn't have an outro screen.
[282:43.77]Here we go.
[282:44.31]There it is.
[282:46.26]Alright, yep.
[282:46.94]Thank you guys.
[282:47.92]See you soon.
[282:48.74]Take care, everybody.
[282:50.76]That's it.
[282:54.08]Alright, hold on.
[282:54.74]Let's go to oldest.
[282:57.96]All videos.
[283:00.94]Should I put on a Modern Warfare 3?
[283:02.34]Alright, let's put on one of these old Modern Warfare 3 videos.
[283:14.94]We got going for a comeback Okay modern warfare 3 going for a comeback 24 and 7 free-for-all going for a comeback I already hate it Not because of the numbers
[283:53.52]I just said it.
[283:55.60]Hey guys, I don't know what happened.
[283:57.41]It's a shitty gameplay.
[283:58.73]And I just got dropped.
[284:00.27]What are we talking about here?
[284:01.33]Okay.
[284:22.63]I don't want to- I refuse to watch this video.
[284:24.27]This is me giving tips on how to use guns in Modern Warfare 3.
[284:28.16]No wonder I deleted it.
[284:29.10]No wonder I fucking put it in there.
[284:38.90]I have nothing to say.
[284:40.71]Even though it's way past that.
[284:42.67]Oh, that's when I curl.
[284:43.49]Those weights are huge.
[284:45.79]I even clarified it.
[284:46.53]Alright.
[284:48.31]I did not find the Minecraft stream.
[284:49.87]Alright, look, we gotta get through the pits.
[284:55.95]Where are we here?
[284:58.17]Thank you, Fantastic Phoenix.
[284:59.93]Morning Maple.
[285:01.35]Thank you for the $7 total here.
[285:04.33]Derma, please play Karamatsu's theme.
[285:08.71]Just trust me.
[285:09.41]Once it gets going, you'll see why.
[285:13.55]Sorry that we didn't do it, but I appreciate this suggestion.
[285:19.70]And Derma, please play the song I suggested.
[285:21.44]It would match really well.
[285:24.84]I'm not messing with you.
[285:25.54]I'm not messing with you.
[285:26.32]I made it.
[285:28.37]Why is everybody saying no?
[285:29.71]No, no, no.
[285:30.61]Oh, is it cowboy music?
[285:31.67]Okay.
[285:34.41]Scammer.
[285:36.83]Hidden episode zero exists.
[285:47.99]Is this it?
[285:49.99]Grandpa's Minecraft time lapse.
[285:55.04]By the way, guys, I thought this video was going to get a million views.
[285:59.14]Let's watch this.
[286:01.74]I'm going to put this on stream.
[286:04.61]I really did.
[286:05.91]After I made this video, I was certain.
[286:08.77]I was 100% certain this was going to blow up and get a million views.
[286:13.65]I was certain.
[286:15.19]And it didn't happen.
[286:16.17]And it was really sad.
[286:18.91]Let's watch it on stream.
[286:24.15]On August 24th, discover what happens on the other side of the street.
[286:28.56]Hey, handsome.
[286:30.02]I'm a woman.
[286:31.52]That's okay.
[286:33.96]What the hell is this?
[286:35.98]I refuse to be, I refuse for you to see this.
[286:39.66]Okay.
[286:42.28]Help Grandpa take over the internet.
[286:43.71]Like and spread this video.
[286:46.11]See?
[286:48.83]Hello, everyone.
[286:50.15]It's Jermay's grandfather here again.
[286:52.94]Time to do an epic time lapse of Minecraft proportions.
[286:59.32]Today, I'm going to be doing a time lapse of the Taj Mahal.
[287:03.96]And it's a place that's in India.
[287:07.62]And it's a big building, and it's going to be so much fun.
[287:11.34]So I hope everyone's ready to go on a magical journey.
[287:14.82]Let's do it together.
[287:16.48]Here we go.
[287:24.07]I was making fun of the stupid time lapse builds everybody had at the time.
[287:27.37]It was like 2012.
[287:31.26]Everybody had the same song and they did the same thing.
[288:02.16]Is me cutting the tree down?
[288:04.94]I didn't take that part out.
[288:15.11]I keep fucking missing.
[288:24.75]Look at this viral video.
[288:29.47]That's, uh... That's it.
[288:33.53]Well, don't even fucking look at me like that.
[288:35.08]This game is hard, okay?
[288:36.82]This is one of the hardest games I've ever played.
[288:39.75]So what?
[288:40.67]So what if it doesn't look like the Taj Mahal?
[288:43.09]You don't even know what the fuck the Taj Mahal even looks like, you shithead.
[288:46.87]You're talking to somebody that fought in the World War IIs.
[288:50.39]I fought in the dinosaur human war of 1966, and I fought in World War II as a fighter pilot.
[288:56.85]So if you want to fuck with me, buddy, you got something coming, and I will stick a knife into your face.
[289:04.09]And another thing, if you do... What?
[289:07.15]There's your viral video.
[289:37.08]Was like I went to bed like it was Christmas Eve and I was gonna wake up on Christmas morning It was gonna be a huge present full of a million views on that video No, oh well That was not private that was not unlisted remember I have like a thousand videos I
[290:07.89]It'll blow up someday.
[290:12.13]Seven years later, make it happen.
[290:14.17]Oh, God.
[290:20.69]This is the exact same formula you've been using a couple of months ago?
[290:26.50]Wait, what do you mean?
[290:28.46]Grandpa's been gone for a long time.
[290:31.86]Post it on.
[290:32.66]No, don't even say that.
[290:36.45]I killed off grandpa.
[290:44.70]I used to do a grandpa video once a week.
[290:47.62]Once every two weeks.
[290:54.32]Front page of R all.
[290:56.00]I'm like, no.
[290:59.10]I would do an apology video for that.
[291:04.00]What was this one?

[291:34.17]No, we're not gonna... No, it's like midnight.
[291:36.74]We gotta get out of here.
[291:39.48]Maybe one day we'll sit here and just... That's what we'll do for the stream.
[291:43.50]We'll just go back and reminisce on yesteryear.
[291:51.67]But... Thank you so much to...
[291:56.06]Fantastic Phoenix for the $1.
[291:57.36]This is a bribe.
[291:58.12]I'm done playing nice.
[291:59.02]If you don't add German Neptune, I'll call the internet police and have you arrested for corruption of planet murder.
[292:06.26]Rocket launcher into the moon.
[292:07.94]Past the moon.
[292:08.82]Moon dodged it.
[292:10.78]Explosion.
[292:11.18]I'm weird.
[292:11.46]I talked about it.
[292:12.76]Dunk, you're risen.
[292:13.30]Thanks for the $1.
[292:14.00]Jeremy, you're my favorite funny boy on Twitch.
[292:15.74]However, I will have to revoke your streamer license if you don't accept your dark side.
[292:20.62]This is your shadow, your true self.
[292:25.68]What is
[292:35.18]Oh my fucking god!
[292:36.26]Fine!
[292:36.60]Ready?
[292:36.86]Oh, there it is!
[292:37.92]Oh, yeah!
[292:45.12]I don't accept it, because it's not real.
[292:47.46]Hey, Greasy Streaker, thanks for the $1.
[292:49.56]Hey, Germ, I just wanted to say thank you for everything that you do.
[292:51.22]I can always count on you bringing the laughs and fun, which is important in my life right now.
[292:56.08]Which has gone from stable and normal to absolutely chaotic within the last month.
[293:00.75]I look forward to your streams.
[293:01.97]They are the highlight of my days for now.
[293:04.39]What you do means so much, and although I cannot give much, I want to show my appreciation by giving you what I could.
[293:10.48]Greasy Streaker, thank you so much.
[293:15.68]This combination of sentences is more than enough.
[293:21.85]Thank you.
[293:23.69]Much love to you.
[293:24.57]Hope that your life can get back on track here.
[293:27.77]Thank you so much, dude.
[293:30.22]Chimera, thanks for the $1.
[293:31.74]Hey, Jerma, it's actually my 21st birthday today, so nice of you to remember and play happy birthday for me.
[293:36.02]Hey, you're welcome.
[293:36.76]We played happy birthday for you.

[293:39.18]Happy birthday, Chimera87x.
[293:40.16]Hey, GK9999, thanks for the $1.
[293:48.42]You said school assembly song, but I want to point out that my senior year of high school, our school assembly's soundtrack included a trap remix of Blue by Eiffel 65.
[294:03.30]Eiffel 60.
[294:04.24]Oh, yeah.
[294:04.60]Blum, Paloo, Abadie, Abadao.
[294:08.62]I remember that.

[294:16.02]Hey, Fay Toru, thanks for the $5.
[294:17.71]Had a blast getting the chance to play with you again, bro.
[294:20.21]Also, shout out to Flo for being a goddamn beast.
[294:22.77]He was insane.
[294:25.61]He landed so many shots.
[294:26.91]He was like 7 to 10 and 1 almost every game.
[294:32.11]He was a very good player.
[294:34.45]It's time for slime.
[294:35.21]Thanks for the $10.
[294:35.65]Hey, German, I'm glad we're getting all these new emotes, but let's not forget those that got us so far.
[294:41.84]I was inspired by the contest to animate a tribute to our old friends.
[294:53.60]This is awesome.
[294:56.68]What's the melted thing down there?
[295:00.64]Is that German mustard that's melting?
[295:10.17]This is great.
[295:12.83]Thanks.
[295:13.17]It's time for slime.
[295:14.11]Coming up with another animation.
[295:18.39]That's really great, man.
[295:19.92]Thank you.
[295:24.62]I love the melted slimer.
[295:30.14]Hey, Sly161, thanks for the $1.
[295:31.64]Am I the last bits?
[295:33.67]Night, night, German.
[295:34.47]Not quite.
[295:34.87]We're almost there, though.
[295:36.59]We're at the end.
[295:37.17]Getting close to the end.
[295:38.94]Based Grandpa thanks for the $1.
[295:40.24]Is Payday 2 on the Germa playlist?
[295:41.94]No.
[295:43.67]I don't think so.
[295:45.19]Not at the moment.
[295:47.55]Probably not.
[295:48.53]There's a lot of other things that need to get done before I do anything else.
[295:51.89]I'm going to sneeze right in your fucking face.
[295:57.15]Thank you, Chubby Funster.
[295:58.45]Thank you, Chubby Funster for the $1.
[296:04.14]Thank you, Chubby Funster for the $1.
[296:06.82]Do you have a shovel in your back pocket?
[296:08.34]Because I'm digging that ass.
[296:11.88]Thank you, Chubby Funster, again for the $1.
[296:13.90]Rose is a red.
[296:14.74]Foxes are clever.
[296:16.21]I like your butt.
[296:16.85]Let me touch it forever.
[296:19.35]Thanks, man.
[296:19.79]Thank you, Drosophilia, for the $1.
[296:21.33]Speaking of bees, have you seen this?
[296:23.45]It's not a Rick Roll, I promise.
[296:28.62]It's not what he wanted.
[296:29.32]That was an ad.
[296:33.54]Dr. Bees.
[296:34.32]This is a Harry Partridge cartoon.
[296:37.60]That guy makes some very very high quality animations.
[297:04.06]But thank you.
[297:05.38]I have never seen it.
[297:06.98]I'll have to watch the whole thing next Christmas.
[297:12.12]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer for the $1.
[297:13.82]Wait, Germa, before you read the Garf comic, you've got to tell Garf Writing Club how you want the combat system to work.
[297:18.41]We want to make it Germa-approved.
[297:20.43]Should it be like sorcery, based on numbers and chance, or completely text-based without random chance?
[297:26.73]Also, my friend says Germa Mustard is cute.
[297:28.77]Give the Mustard Man a mustard medal.
[297:31.23]And here's a comic book.
[297:32.74]So, for combat system...
[297:35.20]You gotta have to be random, man.
[297:37.72]You gotta have to be weighted random.
[297:39.58]Weighted RNG.
[297:41.06]That should be fine.
[297:41.96]Is this real?
[297:42.88]What are you talking about?
[297:45.12]Thank you, Garfield, and here's the comic book for today.
[297:48.12]Too bad it's Monday tomorrow.
[297:49.26]The week was going so well.
[297:50.44]German streaming.
[297:51.14]I'm fed.
[297:51.90]I'm in my comfy bed.
[297:52.92]That Monday mastermind is just waiting to pounce.
[297:56.42]This is an actual Garfield comic.
[297:58.54]It ends with Garfield dying.
[298:00.40]I didn't edit this.
[298:01.39]What was Jim Davis thinking?
[298:09.05]I don't know.
[298:10.56]I have no idea what the fuck he was thinking.
[298:15.18]But thank you, Garfield.
[298:17.12]Darkstar, thanks for the $2 here.
[298:19.72]Don't ever listen to Death Grips, if only to fuck with chat.
[298:23.81]I like wacky experimental music as much as the next guy, but Death Grips is just unbearable.
[298:30.89]Anyway, see you at my own crucifixion at the hands of chat.
[298:33.66]I was just going to say...
[298:36.31]There's one thing you have to remember that's really important.
[298:39.36]Don't ever have an opinion about music.
[298:40.80]Don't ever have an opinion about video games.
[298:42.20]Don't ever have an opinion about TV shows.
[298:43.60]Don't ever have any opinions about movies.
[298:48.06]You can't.
[298:48.72]There are no such thing as personal opinions.
[298:50.70]You can't have it.
[298:56.02]Because you'll end up with like 500 people on Twitter screaming at you.
[299:08.38]Eliminate all vocabulary that has the word, like, star and wars together.
[299:14.05]Don't ever write those together.
[299:16.47]Don't do that.
[299:19.13]Always make sure that you have enough space in between.
[299:22.95]So, if you... Like, oh, the stars are shining so brightly tonight.
[299:28.10]Man, by the way, those world wars were terrible.
[299:30.58]Like, that's the only way you're allowed to use those two words.
[299:35.08]So...
[299:38.34]Same thing with music.
[299:40.06]Don't say, oh, I really don't like Drake.
[299:43.19]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[299:43.95]You're doing it wrong because people are going to be mad at you.
[299:46.03]What you have to say is, totally shit, man.
[299:48.81]I just fought a Drake in Skyrim.
[299:50.97]He was so bad and slow, and I didn't really like that part of the game.
[299:56.88]That's all you have to do, and that'll hide you.
[300:05.34]No, I don't hate Drake.
[300:06.88]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[300:08.46]That was insert random musician into the bracket, like a code.
[300:13.26]That was code.
[300:14.30]I pulled out the... I could have said Iron Maiden.
[300:17.44]I could have said Frank Sinatra.
[300:20.75]It don't matter.
[300:21.47]That was insert fucking bracket slash bracket colon code.
[300:29.03]No, I love Iron Maiden.
[300:37.82]breaks tail to get a weapon.
[300:40.00]Alright.
[300:41.28]Let's go.
[300:41.56]Hey, don't let me... I'm going to get the smoke out here.
[300:43.98]Don't let me get the bee smoke.
[300:49.16]But anyways, Darkstar, thank you for the $2 here.
[300:51.97]He said, I'm purposely going to give you 99 bits for the second one because I don't want everyone to see this.
[300:57.97]Oh.
[301:00.81]Oh.
[301:02.19]Okay.
[301:05.03]Um, okay.
[301:05.37]Okay.
[301:08.19]That's very interesting.
[301:12.19]I'll have to look into that, for real.
[301:15.05]Because that's... I did not even know that was a thing.
[301:17.26]Thank you, though.
[301:18.82]Maradickle, thanks for the $1.
[301:20.06]I've searched your Twitter for the keywords interview, army croc, dog to navel, and Skype.
[301:23.98]Absolutely nothing.
[301:24.68]I'm convinced your obsession with this game just resulted in you dreaming you interviewed him.
[301:27.92]We already proved it.
[301:28.80]We already proved it.
[301:29.78]We already proved it.
[301:30.78]We already proved it.
[301:32.74]Thank you for the $1.
[301:33.24]Thank you, Chubby Funster, for the $1.
[301:34.76]Can you go back to using that shitty mic, please?
[301:36.52]Thanks, cutie.
[301:38.38]Okay.
[302:13.63]Never mind, it's not going to work.
[302:16.49]The webcam wasn't plugged in.
[302:18.55]I was going to use the webcam mic for the rest of the bits, but I can't.
[302:22.59]Thank you, Smellyboy, for the $1.
[302:23.91]Germa, hidden video creepypasta.
[302:25.67]When?
[302:27.03]That sounds like a fun idea.
[302:29.45]Maybe.
[302:29.97]Maybe, maybe, maybe.
[302:30.69]Thank you, Captain Worgen, for the $1.
[302:32.10]You might not have 1 million views on your Minecraft video, but at least you have me to insult you.
[302:37.06]through bits yes I do thank you for the one dollar thank you the epic biggie for the one dollar I'm getting my driver's license soon and my friends are expecting me to take them driving but I'm not comfortable driving with them what should I do say the same thing I said four hours ago on this stream I'm learning
[302:57.43]Dude, okay, it's like your friend's going to get in the car.
[302:59.66]Dude, how come you don't know how to drive?
[303:01.56]Why do you not understand how to drive yet?
[303:03.76]You don't know how to drive?
[303:05.46]You don't know how to play the game yet?
[303:06.62]Why are you so bad at flying around?
[303:08.20]You just downloaded it.
[303:09.84]Why are you bad?
[303:11.67]Look, I'm learning.
[303:12.81]I have my learner's permit in the game.
[303:15.23]I just got my license for the first time.
[303:19.27]I'm not comfortable until I'm more prepared and I have at least 50 to 100 hours in the car, in the game.
[303:25.80]I'm glad... Right here, man.
[303:27.20]Thank you.
[303:27.62]I'm glad we can both fucking... You know what I'm saying?
[303:29.60]We're both in this together.
[303:35.58]Driving's actually challenging.
[303:37.01]I love driving around.
[303:37.81]I drive every day.
[303:43.63]Driving is very relaxing for me.
[303:49.95]Driving stresses me out.
[303:53.32]It can if you're driving in a really fucked up, packed in area.
[303:56.04]Like, driving around Boston sucks.
[303:57.30]I hate it.
[303:59.50]Boston is one of the worst cities to drive around in.
[304:03.00]New York, LA.
[304:05.11]Driving around Vegas was actually very, very nice.
[304:07.49]There's a lot more road.
[304:10.31]There's a ton of lanes.
[304:14.03]It's very flat.
[304:18.72]Boston driving, for some reason, they made this stupid soft serve ice cream roads.
[304:24.36]I don't know why they did this.
[304:26.50]All the Boston highways and all the Boston major arteries, they all swirl the fuck around each other.
[304:34.15]I don't know why they did this.
[304:35.83]Why didn't you just go from A to B?
[304:37.91]Why did you go from A to Z to W to X to Y to B to D back to A?
[304:42.80]Why?
[304:44.06]Who did this?
[304:44.58]What have you done?
[304:49.83]All the roads are so small, they're so tiny.
[304:53.22]Boston sucks driving around.
[304:55.10]Every time I have to do it, I'm just like, God, fucking gag me.
[304:59.88]It's a goddamn colonial city.
[305:01.54]Yeah, like cow shit and dog shit.
[305:04.09]Oh, you know, this is an old colonial city.
[305:08.25]Make sure to have enough room for the buggy and the horses.
[305:11.21]Fucking dynamite.
[305:14.27]Blow that open and make six lanes.
[305:18.19]Oh, but you don't understand.
[305:19.29]Paul Revere went down these roads.
[305:20.53]We can't do that.
[305:21.25]We have to go around the fucking house and down past the church and then back towards the highway.
[305:26.02]Don't you understand?
[305:26.54]Paul Revere was here one time.
[305:27.66]See the statue?
[305:28.20]Did you see the statue?
[305:28.84]Have you seen the statue yet?
[305:29.68]It's very, very wonderful.
[305:33.22]Take the Freedom Trail.
[305:34.59]Oh, yes, you could walk the Freedom Trail.
[305:39.91]And wave at all the fucking assholes driving around in a circle five times around you.
[305:55.76]Oh, Boston, look, I've lived in this area my entire life.
[306:03.27]But, you know, sometimes it's time to rip off the belt buckle.
[306:06.85]You know what I mean?
[306:07.43]It's time to take off the fucking buckled shoes.
[306:15.23]Boston's one of those old, old timey cities.
[306:19.14]They still got these old blue laws.
[306:22.20]Well, the thing is, be careful here, because on Sunday, that's the day that the pilgrims, they used to do this.
[306:26.88]They used to go to church on Sunday and, excuse me, a very important thing, everything shuts the fuck down.
[306:32.93]And then did you see the cars driving around in a circle?
[306:40.76]No alcohol at all.
[306:42.28]Don't you dare.
[306:46.20]It's crazy.
[306:47.98]Some of the alcohol laws in Boston, for some of the biggest drinkers in the country, we've got all these fucking old school alcohol laws.
[306:58.53]Now, we've got to be careful with those.
[306:59.71]Make sure no booze on Sunday at this specific time.
[307:02.61]By the way, this is one of the heaviest drinking fucking places in the country.
[307:12.42]Make sure, by the way, if you're not seen with your horse at 4 a.m.,
[307:16.02]You get one free bonus bingo round.
[307:18.02]Whatever the fuck they have here now.
[307:26.78]Throw the alcohol into the ocean.
[307:31.01]And then fucking tea on it.
[307:32.59]Pee on it.
[307:36.75]No, but as much as the jokey shit I'm talking.
[307:40.27]I, um... No, Boston's a great city.
[307:45.56]needed I need to change your pace and we're almost done here thank you too uh sly 161 for the one dollar now I'm the last bits no you're not thank you though chubby funster thanks for the one dollar did you sit in a pile of sugar because you have pretty sweet ass thank you mandy
[308:13.18]Thank you, Mandy, for those bits.
[308:14.80]Thank you, Chubby Funster, for the $1.
[308:16.52]You can call me Cake because I'll go straight to your ass.
[308:21.59]And then they say, I'm done.
[308:22.49]Well, that's good because now you're done.
[308:24.99]Hey, Darkstar, final bits.
[308:26.83]Thanks for the $1.
[308:28.07]Advantage of living in New York.
[308:29.41]That's not what it says.
[308:30.81]Advantage of living in North Carolina.
[308:32.79]Nearly every major road has a turn lane that makes left turns to and on and off the road a million times easier.
[308:39.21]Yes.
[308:41.62]There are no turn lanes almost in this entire city.
[308:46.82]In this whole state.
[308:50.16]Turn lanes, there are turn lanes everywhere.
[308:55.20]Especially in that southern hemisphere there.
[308:57.36]And in Vegas, there's a turn lane every fucking road.
[309:02.53]You can't, that's why the traffic is such dog shit around here.
[309:07.09]Because they just have these roads that are just straight.
[309:09.77]Oh, they loop around each other.
[309:15.02]New England is kind of a nightmare on the road.
[309:16.90]It really is.
[309:20.25]Is he still complaining about Boston?
[309:23.35]No, I'm complaining about the fact that they had a horse and buggy on these roads and then never decided to make them more modern.
[309:34.20]And like I told you, they just... Never mind, guys.
[309:44.33]Jeremy, you should send in a magician tryout video to fool us.
[309:47.97]What?
[309:53.19]Streamer hates Paul Revere.
[309:59.16]It's funny because sometimes they'll have a horse will walk by.
[310:05.02]sometimes am I making this whole thing up or did I dream this I don't know but I'm gonna say it anyways a horse will go by like with some guy in it with like a top hat and he's like good day fellow bostonians I think it's like a play that they do in the street I think I dreamed this
[310:29.20]No, I'm I'm okay.
[310:30.60]This is like a renaissance fair Like old-style kind of place that you go to go pretend like you're in that world Did this happen as a renaissance fair when I went a year ago Yes, yeah the renaissance fair a guy walked by and it was like I
[310:51.94]And he took his hat off and he was like, good day, fellow citizens.
[310:54.30]And I just made that guy.
[310:56.50]I just misremembered that guy into Boston because I'm talking about how much I hate the roads in Boston.
[311:02.67]And I just turned that whole story inside out.
[311:10.95]But anyways.
[311:12.91]Thank you so much for watching, everybody.
