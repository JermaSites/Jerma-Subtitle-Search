[00:04.38]What's happening?
[00:07.10]What's up?
[00:07.70]We're playing Phasmophobia.
[00:12.64]With some people.
[00:16.56]Got a coffee here.
[00:17.27]I'm ready to go.
[00:21.53]Vaude Real?
[00:22.51]That's right.
[00:29.40]Do the Luddy.
[00:30.12]Alright, I'll listen.
[00:31.84]I'm going to be doing VR because of the Among Us VR is coming out.
[00:38.90]When I do, I will do the Luddy.
[00:41.42]During when I do full camp.
[00:44.80]OK.
[00:46.26]And it's going to be sick.
[00:47.44]Going to be one of the best you probably ever seen.
[00:50.11]I'm just going to make that very clear.
[00:57.39]Yeah, so today we're playing... I didn't even tweet.
[00:59.35]Oh, shit.
[01:01.03]We are playing Phasmophobia.
[01:03.73]Then at Dead of Night.
[01:06.71]Then, maybe, Stay Out of the House.
[01:12.52]Nice to finally join us, dude.
[01:13.84]Why were you here late?
[01:16.24]Why are you talking... Why are you saying it like that?
[01:21.50]Why are you saying it like that?
[01:22.90]I know I have the radio voice today.
[01:25.58]I know that.
[01:28.05]Every single stream, it seems, over the last five years, I start out with the radio voice.
[01:35.89]And then it slowly goes from this to this over the course of about seven hours.
[01:40.45]I'm getting old.
[01:41.91]And that's just the way it is.
[01:44.89]Alright.
[01:45.71]Are we ready?
[01:46.11]Are we good?
[01:48.99]Dinner is cold.
[01:49.97]Dude, change your pinned tweet.
[01:56.32]Yeah.
[01:58.72]Alright, okay, can all the social media managers of the channel just relax for a few minutes?
[02:08.49]Dude, change your pinned tweet.
[02:12.01]Alright, alright, alright, okay.
[02:15.67]I'm going to tweet a regular tweet right now.
[02:19.02]It's phasmophobia.
[02:22.82]How do you spell phasmophobia?
[02:25.80]Can somebody spell it?
[02:27.97]Is it phasmophobia or phasmophobia?
[02:32.29]Is it like phasmophobia?
[02:36.39]So it's phasmo.
[02:40.83]Okay.
[02:45.06]Okay.
[02:46.86]Phasmophobia, let's go.
[02:47.80]Let's get it.
[02:50.88]I like let's get it.
[02:51.84]It's better.
[02:55.92]How about phasmophobia?
[02:58.32]And other scary things.
[03:02.61]Let's get it.
[03:03.21]Yeah, that's perfect.
[03:07.55]Hope you guys are having a good day.
[03:08.49]And okay.
[03:12.62]Hope you guys are having a good day.
[03:13.72]Let me just say words while I write the tweet.
[03:17.98]There it is.
[03:18.36]Alright, here we go.
[03:23.69]I wonder if everybody's ready.
[03:25.63]Guys, I don't even know how to play Phasmophobia.
[03:27.69]I'm a level 1.
[03:30.07]I played it like a year and a half ago.
[03:31.53]Okay.
[03:36.33]Check in and see how we're doing.
[03:40.65]Fuck, I forgot I was muted for them, but not for you guys.
[03:45.07]How we doing?
[03:45.97]How do you guys feel?
[03:46.95]Good?
[03:50.54]My stream's running.
[03:52.90]We're ready to rock and roll whenever.
[03:55.81]I am back.
[03:56.45]Can you guys hear me?
[03:57.73]Yep.
[03:57.93]Alright, I'm back.
[04:00.41]Hello.
[04:03.17]If I show the screen, there's nothing on the screen that's not going to leak the game code or anything, right?
[04:07.83]No, it's hidden up top, right?
[04:11.99]Yeah, game code.
[04:13.05]They actually implemented that.
[04:14.69]Okay.
[04:17.40]So, uh, yeah, once again, everybody, I have with me Jerma, Ross, and Liam Triforce, and also, um, a basketball.
[04:28.63]Special guest.
[04:29.53]How do I walk?
[04:30.15]Special guest, basketball, Jack-o'-lanterns.
[04:32.33]How do I leave this, uh, this board?
[04:35.70]Space, I think.
[04:37.58]Oh, thank you.
[04:38.80]Oh, right.
[04:39.50]Yeah, there you go.
[04:40.28]Who the hell is Jerma?
[04:43.00]He's, um, famous streamer.
[04:45.97]No, no, no.
[04:46.85]You stream TF2 once or twice.
[04:50.14]Go watch my Anubis tutorial smite video.
[04:53.36]That's what I'm known for.
[04:55.54]That one.
[04:56.90]Alright, I gotta make it so it's not push to talk because I'm gonna scream something at you guys and you're just not gonna hear it.
[05:02.71]Okay.
[05:04.37]Just for the record, everyone watching, Liam and I are in VR.
[05:08.57]Ross and Jerma are on desktop.
[05:10.88]Yeah, we're not in VR.
[05:11.40]So our experiences will be different.
[05:12.86]If you want to watch Jerma's perspective, you can go to his channel as well.
[05:17.78]I can't tell which is which.
[05:19.24]It's so funny hearing the different in each ear because it's the positional audio.
[05:23.72]That's funny.
[05:27.41]Throw a foothball.
[05:30.91]Alright.
[05:31.43]Is this better?
[05:31.95]Can you guys hear me?
[05:34.58]Yeah, it's a good Halloween game.
[05:36.18]Oh, well, you can keep the basketball on you if you need it.
[05:40.72]Like, I just have it on my belt now.
[05:42.38]Save it for later.
[05:43.12]Throw it at the ghost.
[05:44.51]How do I turn, uh, somebody, uh, people saying that everyone, uh, we're all loud, apparently?
[05:49.49]Loud?
[05:50.39]Is it, is it the menu screen?
[05:51.55]Is there a way I can drop people's levels in here?
[05:55.21]A tab or something?
[05:57.48]Uh, the menu screen here, you can turn it.
[05:59.74]Oh, right.
[06:00.34]Okay, right, right, right.
[06:01.78]Oh, okay.
[06:04.64]chat everyone's good on my end right like they sound like human like human with good volume I think that's probably a little bit better how's my volume I'm okay yeah everyone's good I think everybody sounds alright now but yeah they did a pretty good job with the lobby you can see there's spooky bats up there there's Jack-o-lanterns there's done dude I just left the game
[06:32.17]Okay, hold on.
[06:33.97]I thought it was like leave.
[06:35.01]They're gonna be pissed.
[06:36.91]Hold on.
[06:46.97]We're about to start, dude.
[06:48.21]Okay, join game.
[06:49.18]I don't want to show this or...
[07:00.36]walk over and like place it in okay so leave is not leave is not okay there's an e-wiggle play hey I'll be the judge of that I'll have to I'll be on the uh the cornhole committee I accidentally pressed leave game instead of leave the menu you're still here committee
[07:19.82]Alright, so this game's pretty dark.
[07:21.08]Where are we going?
[07:21.78]How do we get out of here?
[07:22.66]Oh my Jesus Christ!
[07:24.12]That was scary!
[07:24.92]I didn't even see that!
[07:27.34]If Chris Martin from Coldplay shocked you on some steps, I'd be scared too, yes.
[07:31.86]Dude, I can barely see.
[07:32.66]Is there like a brightness?
[07:34.24]Dude, there are lights on in this room and I can't see anybody.
[07:38.01]It's so dark.
[07:39.33]Yeah, it's really dark.
[07:40.23]There's a flashlight I think that we can use.
[07:42.29]It is... Tea?
[07:47.03]T?
[07:47.69]Let's try that.
[07:48.81]That's so much better.
[07:49.67]I just went into brightness and just turned it up.
[07:54.15]Okay.
[07:54.91]I might do that too, actually.
[07:55.95]That'll do.
[07:58.13]So, chat, it's been like, I guess over a year since I've played this, so it's been updated quite a bit.
[08:03.17]There's like a mental asylum.
[08:05.83]Like, Liam, you've played this a lot.
[08:07.25]Do you know how to go to the asylum?
[08:10.24]Yeah, when you select a mission, you'll be able to pick the asylum.
[08:13.83]As long as it's available, I'm pretty sure it should be.
[08:16.45]It says it's locked.
[08:18.29]Oh, damn.
[08:19.01]I guess we gotta play the other missions, then.
[08:21.25]Would you be able to make a map, like a server, and, like, select it?
[08:26.01]Or is it just because we're all underleveled?
[08:29.56]Yeah, we're operating at, like, zero.
[08:31.24]I probably don't have it.
[08:32.44]Whenever I have levels, I just piggyback off of my friends to get the new levels.
[08:36.58]Because they'd always be, like, a little sick or something.
[08:40.24]Um, well, we could go to the farmhouse.
[08:42.48]I don't think we've seen this one.
[08:43.54]I have no info.
[08:45.31]I don't know where anybody is.
[08:47.57]Oh, wait.
[08:49.47]Oh, hang on.
[08:50.01]Let me see if I can find the asylum.
[08:51.37]I think I can pick it.
[08:53.45]Oh, really?
[08:54.19]What's it called?
[08:54.83]Sunny Meadows?
[08:57.39]Uh, maybe we don't want to start at the asylum anyway because we're all rotten at this.
[09:01.65]Yeah, so we'll figure that out.
[09:03.27]Let's try this Bleasdale farmhouse and we'll bust some ghosts.
[09:07.92]Yeah.
[09:08.30]Okay, I think, yeah, we can vote for the asylum whenever we're ready.
[09:12.04]Oh, okay, so ready up?
[09:14.10]Ready up.
[09:15.32]Okay, how about equipment?
[09:16.74]Do we want to bring equipment?
[09:18.54]Yeah, we don't have a crucifix, candle, motion sensor, salt, sanity pills.
[09:24.58]We're going to need those.
[09:25.40]I'm going to bring a lighter.
[09:28.82]Okay.
[09:28.98]Why are you guys all hunched over?
[09:35.20]I'm not hunched over.
[09:36.96]No, this is just my normal posture.
[09:39.54]What?
[09:39.78]Everybody's leaning forward.
[09:42.63]I'm an osteoporobro.
[09:45.25]Oh my god.
[09:46.01]We got some stuff.
[09:50.24]Like, the way you guys were standing is the way that I guarantee a side profile candid picture of me sitting on the couch with a remote control at the TV is.
[09:57.12]That's exactly what it looks like.
[09:59.22]It's like that, like... Yeah, this.
[10:03.13]That is the exact pose.
[10:04.23]Like, the neck forward, shoulders rolled.
[10:09.68]Alright, everyone, I think we're ready to bust some ghosts.
[10:12.44]Alright, you guys are gonna have to hard carry.
[10:14.84]I have no idea what the fuck's going on.
[10:18.19]Alright, and we don't get Ghostbusters equipment like that last game we played.
[10:22.07]Oh, no.
[10:22.57]We only play games together, Jerma and I in particular, if it's Ghostbusting related.
[10:26.91]I know, it has to be Ghost related.
[10:29.56]It just started happening this way.
[10:34.49]Oh yeah, we don't have any sanity pills, we might need those.
[10:37.85]Oh.
[10:39.79]Oh, am I not ready?
[10:40.77]Uh, yeah.
[10:44.04]Oh, there we go.
[10:47.58]Cool.
[10:48.32]I got confused.
[10:50.10]Alright.
[10:51.08]We got some sanity pills now.
[10:53.04]Okay, we have at least one.
[10:55.64]Oh, we goin'?
[11:01.41]Oh, okay.
[11:06.65]Guys!
[11:07.01]There's a skeleton in here already!
[11:09.84]Hang on, let me investigate.
[11:14.32]Oh, yeah.
[11:16.48]There's a little bit of meat on the bone if anyone's hungry.
[11:19.42]Gross.
[11:22.54]No, I'm not... I'm not wearing a Halloween mask.
[11:25.57]Stop fucking saying it.
[11:27.23]I put it in the title.
[11:30.43]People keep asking me this.
[11:31.49]It's like just getting annoying.
[11:32.59]Like, dude, do you have a Halloween mask on?
[11:34.99]No.
[11:37.48]Look!
[11:38.72]Whatever.
[11:42.56]Trying to... Why am I already at 99% sanity?
[11:44.24]98%?
[11:44.28]What the hell?
[11:45.30]Oh, it just fluctuates.
[11:47.12]Oh, I looked at the skeleton.
[11:50.00]Oh, yeah.
[11:50.32]That must be it.
[11:51.32]Alright, so we... How do you tell the ghost with a smudge stick while it's chasing someone?
[11:55.28]Well, I hope we have a smudge stick.
[11:56.78]Hold on.
[11:59.30]It changed a lot of stuff.
[12:00.40]We've got a lightsaber.
[12:04.40]A camera.
[12:05.24]How do you open the inventory?
[12:07.85]How do I pick up a flashlight?
[12:10.49]Oh, there we go.
[12:11.97]E. Can I take the camera?
[12:41.71]Oh, how'd you do that?
[12:44.49]On the utility belt, you take out the little walkie-talkie and just hold whatever button it's mapped to.
[12:50.52]I don't know on keyboard.
[12:53.68]Does anyone need a light?
[12:56.86]V?
[12:57.92]Is it V?
[13:01.10]Hello?
[13:01.48]Hello?
[13:07.61]How do I open the belt?
[13:13.70]Utility belt?
[13:14.58]B?
[13:15.44]Utility belt is... I'm trying some buttons right now.
[13:20.50]Oh, okay.
[13:22.42]If we're going to do this, we need smudge sticks, and I don't think we have any.
[13:25.40]So, we're just going to have to try and identify the ghost based on what we can see.
[13:29.59]Okay.
[13:30.11]And then head on out.
[13:30.79]You have more levels in this game than we do, so you're now de facto team leader.
[13:34.79]Alright, alright, alright.
[13:35.75]Okay, well.
[13:36.29]That's not B. You'll be fine, I promise.
[13:41.05]Okay, okay.
[13:47.78]Let's use the flashlight.
[13:55.94]Hold B. I'm holding B. It's not doing anything.
[14:00.77]How do I access the belt, though?
[14:02.67]Did we bring an EMF detector?
[14:04.59]Is that Spirit Box?
[14:09.57]Oh, boy.
[14:12.65]We did bring a camera.
[14:14.84]That's good.
[14:16.58]So we can set that up somewhere and look for ghost orbs where the thing might be.
[14:20.44]But if we don't have an EMF, that might be tricky.
[14:25.65]I got the camera right here.
[14:27.47]You take pictures and if the ghost shows up on the thing, you scream, right?
[14:31.95]Yeah.
[14:32.75]Yeah.
[14:33.43]Okay.
[14:36.11]Okay.
[14:36.95]I'll burn her up.
[15:01.89]It's really windy.
[15:03.75]Vinny, it sounds like you're in a call with me on my desk.
[15:08.15]Speaker.
[15:09.94]Like, oh man, we couldn't get Discord to work.
[15:11.60]It's alright, Vinny.
[15:12.54]You can come through on my iPhone through the speaker.
[15:19.66]Oh, piano, let's play it.
[15:24.96]Okay.
[15:26.77]Jesus, what the fuck?
[15:28.73]That was... You did that, right?
[15:30.41]Wait, was a ghost doing that?
[15:31.43]The ghosts don't get started this early.
[15:35.15]I think they give you, like, a minute.
[15:39.26]Oh, you guys gotta play something.
[15:46.64]Oh, that's sad.
[15:47.30]I wish I could do that.
[15:49.50]Wait, can I?
[15:50.00]Wait, can we just tap it when we're down?
[15:58.75]Oh.
[15:59.23]Oh, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha.
[16:00.51]Alright, who's coming upstairs with me?
[16:01.71]Where are we off to?
[16:04.71]Where are we going?
[16:19.20]Uh, we can hit the attic.
[16:20.16]See if there's, uh... Check the attic.
[16:23.44]...any spooky phenomenon.
[16:25.62]Dude, we are doing this so wrong, man.
[16:28.68]Like, I should be all the way back.
[16:31.82]I should be, like, key light.
[16:33.10]You should be focus light.
[16:34.13]You know what I mean?
[16:36.35]Oh, I don't like this.
[16:37.19]There's a... Ooh.
[16:40.59]Hello there.
[16:43.77]Oh, I just lo- Okay, there you are.
[16:46.42]Okay, I found... Paintbrush.
[16:48.72]Wait, does... Does that matter?
[16:53.25]I don't... I don't think so.
[16:57.39]Do we... Do you have, like, a book we could put down?
[16:59.95]Oh, I can take a picture.
[17:01.01]Should I... Should I... I do have a book.
[17:03.63]Should I put it right here?
[17:04.47]Okay.
[17:05.05]Yeah, put it there and see if the demon, like, writes in it.
[17:07.97]Okay.
[17:08.69]Then we can point a camera at it.
[17:10.63]Do we need to open it?
[17:11.45]I don't know.
[17:12.21]I got a camera here.
[17:13.05]Oops.
[17:14.49]Oh.
[17:19.01]I really have no idea.
[17:21.37]We're just like... I'm just making this up as I go along.
[17:24.85]Alright, hold on.
[17:25.38]Let's take a... Okay.
[17:27.90]Beautiful.
[17:28.48]How many photos can you take?
[17:30.44]Get my good side.
[17:32.22]No, you didn't.
[17:35.08]How do I... Press... Oh, okay.
[17:37.02]There we go.
[17:37.28]Okay.
[17:37.72]I put the... I put it down.
[17:38.54]Is it open?
[17:39.44]It's open on the table.
[17:42.88]Alright, now we just gotta wait for it to... Maybe it'll write something.
[17:46.81]We can come check on it later and just go downstairs.
[17:49.73]Yeah, that works.
[17:51.67]Doesn't this game listen to your microphone, too?
[17:54.51]Yeah, I think if you, like, learn its name and say, suck my balls, suck my balls.
[17:59.91]Oh, okay.
[18:02.60]Oh, hey, what's up, man?
[18:05.22]Hey, did you know... Wait, you have a camcorder?
[18:11.92]Yeah?
[18:12.12]Yeah?
[18:15.97]The lens cap is on.
[18:26.80]Alright, so I... Was that somebody?
[18:30.24]Was that a shadow?
[18:31.24]I don't know.
[18:34.88]Okay.
[18:35.22]Something just flew.
[18:43.27]Something just flew by.
[18:43.85]Something just flew by me.
[18:45.35]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[18:47.15]Like a book just flew from right to left, I swear.
[18:49.95]A book?
[18:50.65]You think it was the book you left upstairs?
[18:52.31]I don't know.
[18:54.29]Liam?
[18:54.73]Liam?
[18:55.71]Have you existed?
[18:59.05]Are you here?
[19:00.05]Hello?
[19:01.79]Dude, I'm getting chills.
[19:02.79]Where is he?
[19:04.30]Is he at like 7-Eleven?
[19:06.18]Hey, can you grab me some Flamin' Hot Cheetos, dude?
[19:08.64]Like on your way back?
[19:09.90]Can you get Jerma Flamin' Hot Cheetos?
[19:12.18]I want the powdered donuts.
[19:14.10]Bronx 120.
[19:15.34]Get the new lime ones though, those things are fucking sick.
[19:19.04]New lime ones, get me a hostess.
[19:26.72]They actually are actually sick.
[19:28.58]The new lime Flamin' Hot Cheetos are awesome.
[19:30.55]Alright, let's check the book.
[19:40.07]Where's the book, over here?
[19:42.41]Anything?
[19:43.49]Not that I can tell.
[19:46.82]It would be pretty obvious.
[19:47.78]It draws, like, pentagrams and shit.
[19:49.58]Maybe not up here, then.
[19:51.84]Huh.
[19:52.88]Gonna bring it with you?
[19:54.42]Oh, yeah.
[19:54.84]Maybe we'll put it somewhere else, maybe.
[19:56.08]Because it would have probably done it by now, right?
[19:58.70]I... I imagine.
[20:02.22]You maybe put it down... Hey, what's up?
[20:09.42]Alright, I'm putting it over here.
[20:12.14]Yeah.
[20:12.84]Maybe... What's the scariest place in this whole house?
[20:19.06]I would have said the attic, but I guess yeah, we could do downstairs Pianos can be pretty scary Okay, yeah, my light just somebody's singing Okay, yeah, I don't like this at all okay.
[20:34.45]They're coming from that room in there on the left I Got a frag grenade going out.
[20:40.90]I guess somebody's right here.
[20:41.58]I got I
[20:44.00]Excuse me?
[20:49.02]What?
[20:50.54]What just happened?
[20:51.33]Um, I'm gonna put the book down on the ground.
[21:00.35]And then we're gonna, let's see, almost like a landmine.
[21:06.97]It'll draw a picture, it'll be like, oh, I have to do this, I'm a fucking ghost, I have to draw a pentagram.
[21:11.45]Right, that's what's gonna happen.
[21:13.33]Exactly.
[21:13.89]Uh... Nah.
[21:23.81]What even was that?
[21:24.79]I don't actually know how to open doors in desktop.
[21:27.57]Do you know how to do it?
[21:29.29]This is the second time I've ever played this game.
[21:30.97]So no, I don't either.
[21:32.01]So we're trapped in here.
[21:33.96]Alright, so we need to figure out how to open a door.
[21:36.70]Which is probably E. Which is probably click.
[21:39.96]It's click.
[21:41.44]Oh, it's left click.
[21:43.22]Oh, this toilet's nasty, dude.
[21:44.73]Let me see.
[21:48.47]Ugh.
[21:52.91]Are we the only two people left?
[21:55.01]I think so.
[21:56.74]Hold on, wait.
[21:57.42]We are... When did, um... Yeah, when did that happen?
[22:04.72]This ghost is aggressive.
[22:05.76]Should we just leave and just... Oh, God.
[22:07.76]Yeah, I know.
[22:08.32]Close that door.
[22:09.00]You scared... Oh, God.
[22:11.43]You scared me just then because you walked through me and I saw your teeth.
[22:15.17]Somebody's singing right now.
[22:17.33]Oh, for fuck's sake, dude.
[22:19.76]I feel like we're playing Left 4 Dead and like, this is the, oh, the good idea.
[22:22.38]Let's go in the bathroom and just aim our shotguns out the door.
[22:24.99]It never works.
[22:25.59]It always feels like it should, though.
[22:28.69]I'm not scared, by the way.
[22:30.79]Just so you know.
[22:33.01]I'm going to hide.
[22:33.43]I'm going to crouch.
[22:36.81]I'm going to also crouch.
[22:40.48]I think it's out there.
[22:42.44]Do we want to go try get back to the trailer and see if we can guess?
[22:48.14]Well, we know it's the singing one.
[22:50.38]I don't know if that matters.
[22:51.80]That's all the information I need.
[22:54.42]Are we locked in here?
[22:55.22]Did we actually... You're joking.
[23:01.25]Can we actually not get out of here?
[23:04.17]I'll try the window.
[23:06.35]The window doesn't work.
[23:08.19]What?
[23:08.45]What?
[23:12.21]Did you open that?
[23:13.11]No, I just tried to open it.
[23:16.02]Oh, fuck.
[23:17.00]You let the ghost in, didn't you?
[23:18.68]I might have.
[23:19.40]I don't know.
[23:19.98]It's possible.
[23:21.86]I'm sweating.
[23:22.74]I'm sweating.
[23:23.66]I mean, no, I'm not.
[23:24.36]I'm brave.
[23:24.84]Let's go.
[23:28.16]Let's just leave.
[23:28.86]This place is bad.
[23:31.26]Wait, hold on, actually.
[23:31.94]Let's check the book.
[23:33.53]Wait, the book actually might have something in it.
[23:35.85]No, it's got nothing.
[23:36.75]Oh, come on.
[23:37.49]Really?
[23:38.98]Yeah.
[23:39.76]Oh, well.
[23:41.12]Okay, let's try to guess.
[23:42.56]This is a warm-up round anyways.
[23:44.72]It's the... The singing... Singing specter... Yeah, they're down here.
[23:56.23]We can't get up there.
[23:56.87]Yeah, you're in... I think they're... I don't know.
[24:00.73]It got me.
[24:01.97]It got you?
[24:02.45]It did?
[24:04.08]What?
[24:17.23]Do you have any stuff?
[24:18.17]Do you have any items?
[24:23.93]Why is this locked?
[24:35.31]I'm getting the fuck out of this house.
[24:36.31]I'm the one that got to stay alive.
[24:42.36]And by the way, you're the singing specter.
[24:46.65]Where's the car?
[24:47.09]Alright, it's the singing.
[24:57.01]Alright.
[24:59.38]She's choking people.
[25:00.36]Alright, I think I got it.
[25:07.72]How do I how do I guess?
[25:09.52]How do I how do I guess?
[25:20.59]Open your journal?
[25:21.55]Okay.
[25:23.57]Ghosts.
[25:24.91]It's the... Oh my god, there's so many.
[25:28.91]What's the one that sings?
[25:34.73]They're probably just like, dude, just fucking get out of the game.
[25:38.47]Go to evidence.
[25:40.34]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[25:42.80]The ghost, I believe, is a...
[25:49.27]We heard singing.
[25:51.35]It was very cold.
[25:53.79]There was a... Music.
[26:00.32]I think it was a ba- no.
[26:03.48]I'm gonna say it's a gym.
[26:10.25]I'm going to say demon and that's it, right?
[26:14.60]A demon.
[26:15.06]I don't know.
[26:16.50]Guys, I don't know how any of this works.
[26:18.00]I'm going to say demon and just call it.
[26:23.90]How do I say yes?
[26:33.66]Go to the truck door.
[26:34.66]Oh, okay.
[26:46.39]Did we do it?
[26:52.67]Did we win?
[26:53.99]It was a revenant.
[26:56.27]What did you guess?
[26:57.88]I guess demon.
[27:00.00]Okay.
[27:00.40]Jerma, can you hear me?
[27:01.32]Revenant.
[27:01.80]Yep.
[27:03.46]Jerma, apparently you couldn't hear me in game because you had me too low.
[27:08.64]I did?
[27:08.94]I was talking, but people were saying I wasn't audible.
[27:12.34]Okay.
[27:13.18]You were coming through the walkie-talkie for a little while.
[27:18.04]I think it was a glitch.
[27:19.36]I don't know.
[27:19.84]I can hear you now.
[27:20.56]Yeah, I think it's a glitch now.
[27:23.28]Also, Liam got booted before we started, so the one dude who knew how to play the game was booted immediately.
[27:28.54]That's so funny.
[27:31.08]We were trying to figure out... Oh, by the way, I'm back now, finally.
[27:33.89]Hi.
[27:35.89]Okay, I opened my book, I was looking at the evidence, and my game just kicked me to the main menu for no reason.
[27:41.25]I guess it was a connection thing, according to Vinny's chat, but...
[27:45.61]Pretty cool.
[27:46.83]I'm surprised at least one of us made it out of there.
[27:50.72]I don't know how.
[27:54.00]I'm going to add as much equipment as I can get.
[27:58.92]We're just going to all walk behind you.
[28:03.68]I'm trying to navigate this new menu, though.
[28:05.91]I'm not used to it.
[28:06.81]I'm telling you, there should be three people with flashlights in a triangle pattern, all pointing in the direction that he is facing.
[28:16.18]We should just be your studio lighting for you to go around and find stuff.
[28:20.58]Okay.
[28:22.82]Candle.
[28:23.22]I'm gonna buy that.
[28:23.90]Let me just get set up real quick.
[28:27.04]Do you want to do the same level?
[28:28.90]Yeah, I'm gonna add a lighter.
[28:31.58]Just keep adding lighters.
[28:33.66]Okay, we got two.
[28:35.56]So we're good.
[28:37.35]motion sensor microphone what's all this stuff I get some there's some jiggling happening that's the stuff we're buying right now somebody said gamer neck hmm
[28:49.06]So, Vinny, how are you using the walkie-talkie?
[28:52.55]What?
[28:53.87]Are you holding... Did you have to physically pick up the walkie-talkie to talk into it?
[28:58.83]Yeah.
[28:59.05]So I have to go like this, and then I have to do this.
[29:05.07]Do we have those as non-VR?
[29:06.76]Yeah, we do.
[29:08.20]I think we hit Q, or maybe we have to hit B or V. Because I was hitting B or V, and it was making a noise.
[29:13.94]A video noise, maybe.
[29:15.64]Okay.
[29:16.49]So it's just, we have to, oh, I thought that holding B was voice chat, but okay.
[29:21.53]I get it.
[29:24.11]I get it.
[29:27.05]Green on one side, red on the other.
[29:29.09]That's like, you got to do RGB lighting.
[29:31.57]If you, if you're like an Epic Call of Duty gamer on YouTube.
[29:35.23]Okay.
[29:35.57]There we go.
[29:35.99]Okay.
[29:36.57]So now you're lit properly.
[29:38.43]Speaking of lit, do we need any more lighters?
[29:41.64]I'm getting as much equipment as I possibly can.
[29:44.02]If we're using smudge sticks, we're probably going to need at least one per person.
[29:48.39]Okay.
[29:49.21]Okay.
[29:49.67]Yeah, V-Dub left a couple smudge sticks here last night, so I'm down for that.
[29:54.05]How much money do I have?
[30:02.06]Um, you can see it over here on this monitor.
[30:04.83]You can see it in the top right.
[30:06.69]How much money you have.
[30:07.65]Oh, I got 25 bucks.
[30:08.59]Did I get a lighter?
[30:10.33]I'll get a... Um, a can of whipped cream?
[30:16.31]Yeah, is that whipped cream?
[30:17.49]Is that Whippets?
[30:18.35]I don't know.
[30:19.69]I don't have... It's Ghostbust Salt.
[30:21.75]Hey, it's okay.
[30:22.23]Guys, I brought two lighters.
[30:23.29]The only thing I haven't added is a motion sensor.
[30:25.51]Okay, there we go.
[30:26.05]Buy.
[30:27.29]Add.
[30:28.33]We are now all set.
[30:29.07]What's the thing we carry around to, uh, to detect when ghosts, like, are near us?
[30:33.85]You have one of those?
[30:34.57]EMF?
[30:36.33]Uh, yeah.
[30:37.01]We've added one.
[30:38.69]Okay, that's good.
[30:39.55]Mm-hmm.
[30:41.97]Let me add another.
[30:45.29]Okay.
[30:46.55]I think with what we have, we'll be alright.
[30:49.53]We've got everything now.
[30:50.35]I'm voting for 10 Ridgeview Court, so... Sure.
[30:54.25]We writing up?
[30:56.13]Sure.
[30:57.39]Sick.
[31:01.23]Alright, hopefully I don't disconnect this time.
[31:03.69]We definitely need you.
[31:05.35]We need your expertise.
[31:10.90]Damon has money.
[31:13.30]We're all here.
[31:14.14]We're all here.
[31:17.03]Perfect.
[31:18.05]Oh, I really, really hope I don't get disconnected this time.
[31:22.41]And if I do, good luck!
[31:24.13]What is this wacky device?
[31:28.47]I think that's... Oh, is it whipped cream?
[31:31.93]Yeah, I think it's a parabolic microphone.
[31:39.88]Hey, guys!
[31:44.38]Oh, I love whipped cream!
[31:46.61]That joke was awful.
[31:47.85]That was not even funny.
[31:50.83]I don't have it today.
[31:55.65]If I ever had it, I certainly don't have it today either.
[31:58.81]I just, I just, we have to understand something.
[32:00.69]I just did the look at, I'm turning the thing upside down and eating it at like three o'clock in the morning out of the fridge.
[32:06.65]That was the humor there.
[32:07.69]Oh, okay.
[32:08.08]That's cool.
[32:10.07]okay so we should probably spread our equipment thin here based on what we have like no we shouldn't have like four emfs like divided between us we only need like uh we need to get the ghost to blow out a candle prevent the ghost from hunting with a crucifix and clear the area near the ghost using smudge sticks so
[32:28.82]I'll bring the crucifix of Jesus Christ through.
[32:30.94]I just played faith, so I know how to do this.
[32:33.78]Do you just hold it up?
[32:34.62]Is that... Yeah, how do you do it?
[32:36.24]Basically, with attacking, you just, like, do this.
[32:39.16]Yeah.
[32:39.60]The power of Christ compel... Okay.
[32:41.22]Exactly.
[32:41.62]Gotcha.
[32:42.44]I think.
[32:44.04]So do... It is actually prayer.
[32:46.12]I mean, like, I've never... It's 50-50.
[32:49.44]Okay.
[32:49.98]So we don't have to actually recite the Lord... Like, when I went to school, they taught me Our Father.
[32:53.80]Should I... Should I say that?
[32:56.44]If that makes you more comfortable, I think you should do it.
[32:58.97]Alright.
[33:01.40]Alright.
[33:02.30]I'll set up a camera and tripod.
[33:04.88]Yeah.
[33:05.72]Yeah, we actually should... Should I take a cross?
[33:10.48]Oh, I need a lighter, yeah.
[33:11.79]How much can we bring in this new utility belt?
[33:15.39]Looks like three items, right?
[33:18.29]Yeah, I've got pretty sure three.
[33:19.93]I have my flashlight.
[33:23.25]I think flashlight's probably really important.
[33:27.45]oh you're gonna need that yeah you can do three I think it's three items keyboard you could yeah on keyboard you're you don't have the hands so they have to accommodate uh oh use your mouse wheel to go between them okay oh my god is this gonna be okay why am I taking the lighter when I could take a flashlight
[33:49.01]That seems like... You could probably... The lighter's probably gonna just be for the atmosphere.
[33:53.67]I'm definitely taking a flashlight.
[33:56.33]You use your phone these days.
[33:58.96]So, who... You have crucifix... Who brought... Does anybody have smudge stick?
[34:03.72]I have a... I have a smudge stick.
[34:05.90]If you have the lighter, definitely bring a smudge stick.
[34:08.50]Oh, yeah, 100%.
[34:09.04]Yeah, you got one.
[34:09.62]You're good.
[34:10.24]Okay, alright, so I should... Should I drop the lighter then and get something else?
[34:15.17]I'll bring maybe bring bring the book or the black light so that way we can see if there's any like nocturnal emissions in the bedroom you guys you guys have emfs right do I need this uh some ghostly goo uh I have flashlight lighter and smudge stick yeah did any I don't think anybody else has an emf so take that okay uh I'll take a spirit box and
[34:40.21]Oh, okay.
[34:40.55]My hands are full, but I mean... You're walking over like... You can just juggle as you go.
[34:45.70]Yeah, I think that's what I'm gonna do.
[34:47.48]You are right now the infomercial where it's trying to show you a product that includes everything that's on your belt and holding it, and you're like dropping shit in black and white.
[34:56.61]Yeah.
[34:56.97]It's like, why would you carry all this stuff?
[35:00.65]Is this you?
[35:01.59]What?
[35:04.18]Alright, you can set that up here.
[35:05.70]No, no, no.
[35:06.26]I just need to turn my flashlight on.
[35:07.96]Once we find the room it's in, then we set it up.
[35:10.06]Where is it snowing from?
[35:11.43]Is this ghost snow?
[35:12.79]Because it's like clear night and snow.
[35:15.41]Maybe it's like ash.
[35:16.43]Is that Earth?
[35:17.07]It's like Silent Hill.
[35:18.41]Yeah.
[35:18.89]Yeah.
[35:19.61]Like it's just coal fires burning under the town for 50 years.
[35:22.83]That's Earth.
[35:26.17]Shit, my flashlight.
[35:27.35]That's not the moon.
[35:28.13]That's fucking Earth.
[35:31.02]Wait, what?
[35:31.42]Wait, what?
[35:33.86]Earth, man.
[35:34.32]That doesn't look like the moon.
[35:35.20]This shit's blue.
[35:40.89]How did you bend that way?
[35:41.99]You, like, broke your spine.
[35:43.41]Oh my goodness.
[35:45.05]Permanent.
[35:45.85]Permanent.
[35:46.31]Okay, not having a flashlight kinda sucks.
[35:47.85]Permanent spine damage.
[35:50.00]Alright.
[35:51.78]I hear something already.
[35:53.52]That's the spirit box, Jerma.
[35:54.76]It's okay.
[35:55.32]Okay, good.
[35:59.99]Okay, I've got the camera set up over here, and I've got the cross in case any demons wish to attempt any kind of damage.
[36:05.57]Alright, should I light the smudge stick?
[36:08.09]No, no, not yet.
[36:08.93]We need to know where it is first.
[36:10.75]Okay.
[36:11.55]It's not in this room.
[36:12.39]I'm not getting anything.
[36:14.03]Give us a sign.
[36:14.41]I'll be right back.
[36:14.95]I'm gonna go get some more equipment.
[36:16.54]Why are we doing this?
[36:18.62]What is your name?
[36:19.94]Give us a sign.
[36:23.49]Uh, let me go over here.
[36:24.56]Well, I should probably not.
[36:26.46]I'm not gonna break up.
[36:27.46]I'm gonna stick here.
[36:31.00]Where's Vinny going?
[36:33.22]Uh, probably to get, get an item.
[36:35.95]Vinny, where you at?
[36:36.47]Hi.
[36:36.67]Okay.
[36:38.23]Vinny, you good?
[36:40.89]Oh, oh yeah.
[36:41.67]No, I'm, I'm fine.
[36:42.43]I'm just grabbing some crystallite vodka.
[36:44.74]Oh, we thought you were dead.
[36:49.41]I'm getting more equipment and I'm monitoring you from the camera in the van here.
[36:55.69]Oh.
[36:56.51]Oh, okay.
[36:56.85]Cool, cool, cool.
[36:57.43]30 seconds before a ghost appears.
[36:58.95]That's what it says here on the timer.
[37:01.33]Ooh.
[37:02.39]We should put something down then.
[37:04.52]Yeah.
[37:05.32]I've got the book.
[37:06.30]Do you want to put down the book?
[37:08.74]Yeah.
[37:09.12]Where should we put the book?
[37:11.06]Any particular location you'd like the book?
[37:12.80]Guys?
[37:14.36]Hello?
[37:17.19]Hello?
[37:17.53]Should we put it in the kitchen?
[37:20.63]We're upstairs.
[37:22.43]I have no idea where I am, dude.
[37:23.77]I've got no flashlight.
[37:24.75]The minute Jerva leaves, I'm completely lost.
[37:27.07]Okay, I'm coming.
[37:27.95]You're stuck in a wall.
[37:29.96]Oh.
[37:31.06]The way you said that, it sounded like you were trapped in the wall and you didn't know how you got there.
[37:36.34]Should I... Give us a sign.
[37:40.70]We need to put the book down somewhere.
[37:42.50]Somewhere that's scary.
[37:43.32]You have an EMF?
[37:49.13]So there's just nothing?
[37:50.11]Okay.
[37:50.79]Alright.
[37:55.06]My hands are full, we're gonna have to open the door.
[37:57.42]What?
[37:57.60]6.2.
[37:57.62]6.2?
[37:57.64]What's the clock say?
[38:09.49]I'm holding the thing that picks up sound and I'm getting decibels.
[38:12.61]I don't know what's happening.
[38:13.59]It's midnight.
[38:14.15]Oh, you are?
[38:15.03]I don't know what that means, but I'll follow you.
[38:19.15]Oh, that's actually really good.
[38:20.19]I don't think I recognize this one.
[38:23.60]Uh... Give us a sign.
[38:25.38]What is your name?
[38:27.00]Give us a sign, you're the piano man.
[38:29.08]Give us a sign.
[38:31.32]It's probably where you were, Vinny.
[38:32.84]If you're getting a reading there, it's probably in that hallway.
[38:35.35]Wait, can you speak?
[38:37.05]Let's make sure that it's not just you speaking.
[38:39.56]Okay.
[38:40.68]Hello?
[38:42.12]I'm a ghost hunter?
[38:43.12]Hello?
[38:44.26]Creepy ghosts.
[38:45.38]You got a 5 dB voice, apparently.
[38:47.22]Oh, I'm quiet.
[38:50.93]My friends tell me otherwise.
[38:53.03]It's so funny, because honest to God, all four of us don't need to be here doing this.
[38:57.13]Like, two of us could do this.
[38:59.39]Right, we could split up into, like, Scooby-Doo groups.
[39:01.87]You know, like, where's the dog?
[39:04.19]We're just blocking the hallway for each other.
[39:06.21]That's so funny.
[39:07.96]I don't think there's anything here.
[39:09.16]Never mind.
[39:10.28]Let's be honest.
[39:10.96]What am I doing?
[39:12.02]What is my job right now?
[39:14.26]You're holding the flashlight.
[39:15.46]Yeah, you're the flashlight guy.
[39:16.58]Yeah, you are Ross' lifeline right now.
[39:18.54]Yeah, without you, I can't see.
[39:20.14]That's...
[39:25.16]Nothing in there.
[39:25.82]I think it's probably downstairs.
[39:27.40]Oh, we didn't check this room yet.
[39:28.78]Check that room?
[39:30.22]I can't open it because I have a ghost.
[39:32.46]Fellas, don't worry.
[39:33.86]I can get the door.
[39:35.82]Thanks, Jerma.
[39:36.56]Thanks, Jerma.
[39:38.71]Are we in the bathroom, ghost?
[39:40.29]Are we in the bathroom?
[39:41.71]No, it's still blue.
[39:43.53]It's still blue?
[39:45.89]Yeah, the EMF is still reading absolutely nothing.
[39:49.63]How?
[39:49.97]I guess it's downstairs.
[39:52.25]I guess it's downstairs, yeah.
[39:54.23]I mean, there is a- isn't this house type of basement, or?
[39:57.80]It might actually, yeah.
[39:59.14]Yeah.
[39:59.88]Or am I thinking of the first one?
[40:00.92]What is that?
[40:01.54]What is that?
[40:02.02]In real life, what is that?
[40:02.74]What?
[40:02.88]What happened?
[40:04.00]Nothing.
[40:04.86]You good?
[40:05.12]Something happening?
[40:06.16]Yeah.
[40:06.28]Where?
[40:07.62]No, no, I, uh... I... Nothing.
[40:11.35]Spider land on you?
[40:13.05]It was itchy, I thought it was a fucking centipede or a spider.
[40:17.09]A centipede!
[40:17.85]I'm alright.
[40:19.59]Uh, once we know where it is, we can use the salt.
[40:21.78]Imagine being in VR and having a centipede climb on your neck.
[40:26.17]Jerma, one time I went to sleep.
[40:29.99]And I was like, you know, I was going like this behind the pillow.
[40:32.59]And then I was like, what is that?
[40:33.45]This feels fuzzy.
[40:34.89]And it was a house centipede on my hand.
[40:38.29]Like it was the worst and it was huge.
[40:40.65]It was the size of like three quarters.
[40:42.71]Is it weird that I would rather have Jason fucking chase me through a house than have that experience where you just had?
[40:48.85]What would you rather?
[40:49.82]I would rather be chased in a house with Jason behind me than have a centipede around my neck in bed.
[40:55.28]You see how disgusting house centipedes are?
[40:57.46]They're like the worst.
[40:59.26]There's a pentagram in here, so I think we're close.
[41:02.20]No, that's normal.
[41:03.45]Is it normal?
[41:04.77]I don't think I recognized that from the last update.
[41:07.89]No, on Zillow, they showed the pentagram.
[41:09.93]It was fine.
[41:10.71]Oh, I see.
[41:11.21]Okay.
[41:12.03]Oh, wait a minute.
[41:14.78]Uh-oh.
[41:15.02]Are you with your ghost?
[41:16.24]Hello?
[41:17.65]How old are you?
[41:19.23]What is your name?
[41:20.25]What is your name, ghost?
[41:21.85]What is your name, ghost?
[41:22.99]Dude, I'm just waiting for the, uh... Oh, did you close that door?
[41:26.38]What the fuck was that?
[41:27.50]Sounded like a door opening.
[41:29.78]Something...
[41:32.42]Guys, shh, shh.
[41:34.24]Smoke stick activated, coming out.
[41:36.79]50, 20 dB.
[41:37.89]Smoke stick activated.
[41:40.63]52 dB, um, where's the cross?
[41:43.01]In the name of the Lord, Savior, Christ.
[41:46.54]I can fucking drop this!
[41:47.62]Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[41:51.44]Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven.
[41:55.36]Give us this hallowed, thy day.
[41:57.24]Is a ghost laughing or is somebody else laughing?
[41:59.44]I'm sorry, I'm just laughing.
[42:02.44]Oh, that was a ghost laugh.
[42:05.77]Yeah, it was me all along.
[42:07.07]You were like just close enough to my left ear where it was like... You were inside of my left ear.
[42:13.42]I'm so sorry.
[42:16.16]Okay.
[42:18.02]It's not down here.
[42:18.78]It's upstairs.
[42:19.44]Yeah, it went back up.
[42:20.82]It's all blue.
[42:21.34]What?
[42:21.48]Did I sprint in there?
[42:25.73]No.
[42:33.70]No, you might die if you do that.
[42:36.80]Oh, this one's like scurrying around.
[42:38.41]I'm dying.
[42:42.87]I'm dying.
[42:44.25]Well, I guess the crucifix didn't work.
[42:50.15]Jerma, where are you?
[42:51.56]Oh, shit.
[42:52.30]I have to go find you.
[42:53.06]Where are you?
[42:54.22]Are you down in the basement?
[42:56.53]I got you.
[42:57.29]I got you.
[42:57.81]Is that you?
[42:58.25]Is that you?
[42:58.63]Is that you?
[42:59.54]Guys.
[42:59.78]Holy shit, dude.
[43:01.14]Um, it yanked my flashlight out of my hand.
[43:03.46]What?
[43:03.80]Did it get Vinny?
[43:05.15]It got Vinny.
[43:05.73]He's dead, I think.
[43:06.53]Oh, look.
[43:06.87]There's his head.
[43:10.87]Or I was like we we should probably go back to the house the spirit box is useless wait How do you open it?
[43:16.19]Oh?
[43:16.35]No the door just closed?
[43:17.19]Oh?
[43:18.43]Did you get level 5 in the EMF or did just freak out mmm?
[43:21.96]I?
[43:22.60]Dude, I just panicked and ran I couldn't I couldn't see anything I do that's who flashlights we can we can regroup here talk about it Try pick that note that that thing's useless you said Okay, well what did he drop it?
[43:35.26]Oh?
[43:37.71]So I should not pick this thing up.
[43:39.70]Grab a flashlight.
[43:41.22]I got it.
[43:42.46]Okay.
[43:45.46]What do we know so far?
[43:46.36]Did your EMF reach level 5 at all?
[43:51.84]No, it didn't.
[43:53.36]At least if it did, I didn't see it.
[43:56.79]Okay.
[43:57.17]Let me see if the crucifix even helped at all.
[44:00.55]No.
[44:01.21]No.
[44:01.67]He died.
[44:02.25]Okay.
[44:02.57]Well, we all have really terrible sanity.
[44:05.67]Let's work on that.
[44:07.09]real quick do we take pills or yeah how many do we have oh my god everybody's here it goes here so we just wait I dropped I dropped the there we go and it's just do I just yeah right click did I do it I heard the sound it probably worked yeah yeah it worked my hands are sweaty so I'm dropping that was so loud alright so we should take more than uh should we take two pills
[44:36.12]Let's hang on just in case.
[44:37.74]Yeah, Vinny didn't get to eat.
[44:41.16]Okay, I dropped the pill bottle.
[44:42.76]It's on the ground right here.
[44:44.24]I'm gonna pick it.
[44:44.86]Where should I put it?
[44:45.42]How do I put something down?
[44:47.53]Here, give it to me.
[44:48.57]Oh, you got it.
[44:49.29]Okay.
[44:49.45]Okay, so what should I take instead?
[44:51.55]I just got a flashlight.
[44:52.73]That's it.
[44:53.81]Did you use the smudge stick yet?
[44:55.93]Yeah, I kind of panicked and just when we were down in the basement, I clicked it and it made like a smoke thing.
[45:00.45]It didn't work, so you can use another one just in case it attacks again.
[45:04.15]Okay.
[45:06.01]I need the candle.
[45:07.16]I have no clue what it is.
[45:08.38]You did not get level 5, correct?
[45:10.30]I'm sorry I asked that four times.
[45:11.96]No, I didn't see level 5.
[45:13.28]I just saw the level blue.
[45:15.48]Okay, we can rule those out then.
[45:18.72]Let's check the journal.
[45:19.97]Let's try and place it where the ghost might be.
[45:21.85]He died in the hallway, right?
[45:23.53]Yeah, the door to the basement, so...
[45:26.81]Okay.
[45:28.23]Um, wait, hold on.
[45:30.67]Uh, did we get a video camera set up yet?
[45:32.95]Yeah, there's one right here.
[45:36.62]Currently recording.
[45:38.62]The office.
[45:40.14]We should probably move that to where Vinny died.
[45:41.92]Okay, let's set it up.
[45:44.22]And then I'll place the journal.
[45:46.80]I have a journal.
[45:47.48]Do you want to just place the camera?
[45:49.72]Yeah, okay.
[45:51.20]Plus, you got VR.
[45:52.02]You're probably better than us.
[45:53.18]Yeah.
[45:57.93]OK.
[46:01.23]I have a head mounted cam.
[46:03.56]You want me to hit cameras right here?
[46:06.40]Cameras right here.
[46:20.27]Was one of you guys lagging?
[46:22.33]Wait, no, they're right here.
[46:23.35]There's a ghost right here.
[46:24.79]There's a ghost right here.
[46:26.57]They're holding a cup.
[46:27.87]If you see ghost orbs, let me know.
[46:30.06]I'll move the camera.
[46:31.44]No one's going to believe me if I don't see this.
[46:33.46]I'm going to be looking like a fucking weirdo.
[46:34.70]I swear to God, this cup was moving.
[46:37.28]That was probably Vinny from Beyond the Grave.
[46:40.60]Oh, he's fucking with us.
[46:42.38]Yeah, you can do that when you're a ghost.
[46:43.98]It's great.
[46:44.48]I love it.
[46:44.94]I thought one of you were lagging for a second.
[46:46.54]Are you moving right now?
[46:47.72]The camera's pretty stationary.
[46:54.88]Oh, hey Vinny, what's up?
[46:56.50]Vinny's, uh, communicating with us.
[47:00.38]Liam, is your camera on right now?
[47:04.04]I'm not sure.
[47:05.26]Can you, uh... I don't... I see... Like, the second camera is, like, black, but it's not moving.
[47:12.72]Do you want... Oh, I see a flashlight.
[47:14.42]Oh, okay, okay.
[47:15.08]Yeah, I got it right here.
[47:16.20]It's me right here.
[47:16.86]Okay, you got it.
[47:17.54]Oh, you found the camera.
[47:18.52]Okay, awesome.
[47:20.08]So, Ross, do you see this floating mug?
[47:22.80]Where do you want it moved to?
[47:26.58]Something's behind me.
[47:30.04]Something's literally behind me right now.
[47:32.40]Go somewhere and hide and be quiet.
[47:33.92]Hold on.
[47:34.46]What?
[47:35.06]Help!
[47:35.48]Help me!
[47:36.62]Ah!
[47:37.60]Smokestick!
[47:39.13]Smokestick!
[47:39.55]I didn't get it.
[47:40.03]Smokestick!
[47:40.55]I...
[47:55.51]Hey.
[47:58.75]Oh, whoa, a ball.
[48:05.74]So that was you that was moving the stuff around?
[48:08.16]That's funny.
[48:09.20]I was moving it.
[48:14.84]Am I muffled when you hear me speak?
[48:17.24]Yeah, you are talking through... You're a very thin wall.
[48:20.92]Yeah, exactly.
[48:22.20]Okay.
[48:22.84]Yeah, when you're ghost, you just get muffled.
[48:25.72]Oh, that's... Okay.
[48:26.74]Well, I can still kind of hear you.
[48:27.82]Okay.
[48:29.02]Apparently, we have to go outside to fix that, so... Roommate voice.
[48:38.37]Yeah, that's like I lean over to the wall here and go, Hey, man, you want anything from McDonald's?
[48:46.45]Hey, can you lower your music?
[48:48.29]Holy shit.
[48:50.63]You just opened up the room to my apartment and did that.
[48:54.96]You're not muffled anymore.
[49:00.08]You just like stormed over and like opened the door.
[49:04.93]Please, I need you to load a music.
[49:12.67]So where are they now?
[49:14.95]I don't know, actually.
[49:18.50]Maybe the basement?
[49:21.02]Dude, let's mess with them.
[49:24.07]Alright, I'm going to grab... Can we grab knives?
[49:28.14]Let me see.
[49:29.06]I can grab a fork.
[49:34.24]Oh, okay.
[49:34.58]I got a plate.
[49:35.12]Alright.
[49:37.51]Then we just need to find them.
[49:39.27]Can I throw this and hit them with a plate?
[49:42.49]I don't know if it'll hit.
[49:44.93]I wonder if it'll break.
[49:48.53]Let's see if they're down here.
[49:54.10]They're not down here.
[49:54.66]Do you see this?
[49:59.85]Do you see the lighter just bouncing?
[50:02.71]No.
[50:05.05]Okay, I'm not making this up.
[50:06.45]Like, there's a lighter that is just infinitely bouncing on my screen right now.
[50:11.21]Somebody else is fucking with us.
[50:12.49]Somebody died in the ghost world and now they're able to mess with the ghosts, I see.
[50:16.69]Yeah.
[50:18.28]Oh, I think they lost.
[50:23.63]Okay.
[50:25.03]I imagine you guys lost.
[50:29.55]Alright.
[50:30.45]It was a thai.
[50:31.95]Of course.
[50:33.13]How could I get that wrong?
[50:34.52]How did I think of that?
[50:35.60]I got 80 bucks for that.
[50:37.86]Oh, good.
[50:39.06]Last thing I saw was a lighter covered in repulsion gel.
[50:44.16]What?
[50:45.02]It was weird.
[50:46.21]Yeah.
[50:47.09]Someone, I'm sure, clipped it, but it was very strange.
[50:51.32]This game is scary.
[50:54.44]Oh, can I buy anything?
[50:57.53]No.
[50:57.67]Mmm.
[51:01.02]Seems that two times of zero is still zero.
[51:03.28]So if I use the smoke stick, does the smoke stick work?
[51:09.17]Okay, so if it's like, oh, you're about to get attacked by a ghost.
[51:11.71]If I do the smoke stick, then they won't get me.
[51:13.71]Is that how it is?
[51:15.89]You know what?
[51:16.47]I think we have to know what room it's in, and then just when we're in the room, we just smudge.
[51:22.10]I think that's what we did wrong.
[51:23.95]Oh, okay.
[51:24.75]Also, the cross, you have to drop it on the ground.
[51:28.01]I was holding it up like a pr- Oh, you don't hold- You knew that?
[51:31.87]The first time I tried to do- I did that exact same thing, and you know what?
[51:35.87]It didn't work, so... I- It wasn't 50-50, I'm just bad.
[51:41.31]Got it.
[51:43.73]I figured it would work like that, I mean, you see it in movies all the time, you hold up the cross.
[51:48.70]I know, I- Yeah.
[51:49.78]That's what I thought.
[51:53.12]Um, Liam, can you vote on the asylum?
[51:56.36]Yes.
[51:57.82]I'm assuming it's... I'm assuming it's Sunny Meadows that I'm thinking of.
[52:03.06]Chat will have to probably clarify which level it is.
[52:05.49]Is it Sunny Meadows?
[52:06.45]It is, yeah, confirmed.
[52:07.87]Perfect, okay.
[52:08.81]I just saw one yes in my chat, and I took that as objective truth, so... Um, do we have a thermometer?
[52:19.13]We're probably going to need that.
[52:22.68]We have a Therpopator.
[52:25.54]Don't laugh at that.
[52:26.84]Playing this game alone would be hard, I think.
[52:29.36]It'd be scary.
[52:31.55]I tried it once.
[52:32.99]I actually had to take the headset off one time because I was too spooked.
[52:37.13]Yeah.
[52:37.85]It gets too real in the headset, probably.
[52:40.78]Yeah.
[52:42.36]Okay, well...
[52:44.68]Let's, um... Let's just, uh, go with what we have, I think.
[52:49.46]Turn your lights off.
[52:51.04]It's like 2... It's like 2 o'clock in the afternoon right now.
[52:53.80]Like, there's no... It's not gonna do anything.
[53:01.45]Crucifix does work in your hand, it just has a small range and it prevents the start of the hunt, not if the ghost is already after you.
[53:07.51]Okay, I understand.
[53:11.07]You West Coast lads, thank you for joining at the time because I wouldn't have been able to do this later.
[53:16.71]This is perfect.
[53:17.66]If it worked out, that's good.
[53:18.76]Perfect for me.
[53:21.84]My audience was like, this isn't my usual time, so they're like, wait, why are you online?
[53:27.04]Why are you here?
[53:29.20]Please leave.
[53:29.66]Explain.
[53:32.37]I just wish there was, like, a melee.
[53:33.61]Just, like, a single right-handed melee punch.
[53:38.31]Punch the ghost?
[53:40.47]I would be so much better at this game if that was in it.
[53:45.24]Like, I would just be the guy that you just deck me out in, like, the melee gear.
[53:48.10]And I just... Even if I can only punch three times.
[53:51.04]I would still be... I'd be so much better at this.
[53:54.65]Jerm, I think, ready up.
[53:56.89]Oh, sorry.
[53:58.03]It's my problem.
[53:58.87]Oops.
[53:59.41]It's okay.
[54:02.75]We get it.
[54:03.15]You like Dark Souls.
[54:05.99]Great franchise.
[54:15.31]Alright.
[54:15.93]Everyone load in?
[54:18.43]Okay.
[54:19.27]Yep.
[54:20.39]Get a ghost to blow out a candle.
[54:24.53]I'm taking a cross.
[54:25.47]Escape the ghost during a hunt.
[54:27.17]Repel the ghost with a smudge stick.
[54:29.53]Okay.
[54:33.93]Well, you know, when I was writing the Ghostbusters film, I got a lot of inspiration.
[54:40.58]Let me tell you, the ghost didn't blow out a candle.
[54:44.94]Who wants to bring the candle?
[54:46.46]And lighter.
[54:49.12]I'm walking around with this thing.
[54:51.16]I got two spots.
[54:52.23]I'll take the EMS.
[54:53.17]What is the price scanner?
[54:54.61]What's this thing?
[54:57.23]That, you just picked up a thermometer.
[54:58.65]Thermometer.
[55:01.33]Helps if we're looking for freezing temperatures.
[55:03.27]That's we need that like crusty basically We just need to make sure we need to rule out all of the possible evidence for the ghost type right by Using like the spirit box emfs just spreading them between all four of us, okay?
[55:19.06]So I have a cross.
[55:20.88]I'm taking the cross Okay I got a spare slot dude.
[55:28.59]Do you want to take anything?
[55:29.96]Can you take the journal again?
[55:31.82]Yep.
[55:33.26]And once we know where it is, roughly, we can come back, get a camera, and then go back in.
[55:40.14]Are you beatboxing?
[55:45.00]No, I'm just pretending this is a weapon.
[55:49.29]I thought you were like spraying compressed air.
[55:55.55]From his mouth.
[55:58.21]Alright, let's do this.
[56:00.24]I got a candle.
[56:01.12]Don't make me pick up the whipped cream can and turn it upside down and do that funny joke.
[56:05.50]Oh, this- you should!
[56:06.76]Listen, I'm not above a whipped cream joke.
[56:09.79]Oh, did anybody take an EMF?
[56:12.73]Uh, yeah, the- the- the- the- Wait, hold on.
[56:15.13]This place is actually kind of terrifying looking.
[56:17.95]I hate it.
[56:18.37]I hate it.
[56:19.17]Alright, I'm leaving.
[56:20.69]Alright.
[56:21.77]See ya.
[56:23.03]Oh.
[56:28.62]Oh, okay.
[56:30.04]Already?
[56:31.80]I've not played this map before, okay.
[56:34.25]We're all screwed.
[56:35.97]Hey, uh, Liam, when do I light the candle?
[56:39.63]Um, once we know where it is.
[56:43.15]It's all basically contingent on once we find it.
[56:45.73]Six bucks.
[56:45.97]Okay.
[56:46.13]How much do you guys think this chair is worth?
[56:51.74]Take a guess.
[56:52.30]Like, all three of you.
[56:53.14]At least one.
[56:54.30]One dollar?
[56:54.88]Don't look at the price, don't look at the price.
[56:56.62]Oh, if the price is right, I'm gonna say, uh, fourteen.
[57:00.16]Fourteen bucks?
[57:00.72]Thirty-five.
[57:01.30]Thirty-five.
[57:01.84]Uh, I'm gonna say thirty-five dollars and one cent.
[57:04.94]Ah, okay.
[57:05.34]Alright, let's see.
[57:09.18]Uh, that was, uh, twelve dollars.
[57:11.33]So who was closer?
[57:13.73]Said fourteen.
[57:15.35]Yeah, that was close.
[57:16.69]You win it.
[57:17.35]It's your chair now.
[57:18.41]Yep.
[57:18.97]Win the chair.
[57:19.59]Wait, why is there a price gun in this game?
[57:21.27]That's what I was trying to ask.
[57:26.52]Something behind this door.
[57:28.14]When you turn it on, look for temperatures.
[57:33.24]It's 30, what, okay.
[57:34.78]Oh, it's Celsius.
[57:35.64]I don't know what this means.
[57:37.90]Celsius.
[57:38.48]Oh, I'm the Canadian here.
[57:39.56]I can discern.
[57:40.68]Alright, so what is bad?
[57:42.18]What am I looking for here?
[57:44.13]Well, you want, like, negative temperatures.
[57:47.81]Okay.
[57:48.95]So, like, once it goes below zero.
[57:52.37]Okay, good to know.
[57:55.25]Pretty cold, pretty cold in here.
[57:56.87]Okay, I dropped my... This is the loudest clicking I've ever... That's... We're doing it as a joke.
[58:08.63]Okay, next room.
[58:10.75]I'm doing that with my mouth.
[58:11.87]That's how loud that is.
[58:13.71]That's me going... Ross, is your EMF on?
[58:18.11]Shit.
[58:20.71]Yes.
[58:21.77]Okay, perfect.
[58:23.35]And it is still blue.
[58:24.10]I'm hearing voices that I'm not sure is VR or real life.
[58:28.06]Like, I don't... I don't know what's happening.
[58:35.86]Books?
[58:37.43]Star dies in crash.
[58:39.77]Man eats self.
[58:42.09]Oh, and man enters space.
[58:46.41]That's less gruesome.
[58:47.99]Uh...
[58:53.83]So that's the headline for today I lost my flashlight.
[59:00.23]Hold on.
[59:00.64]Do you see this?
[59:01.40]What movie is that from?
[59:02.94]I'm just gonna say Blade Runner Wait, what?
[59:20.08]How would you know that?
[59:21.00]It's kind of like the one they drink whiskey from in Blade Runner, where Harrison Ford is like, just... He's just drunk and everything.
[59:26.24]It's a cup!
[59:26.84]Like, it's in other things!
[59:28.14]Like... Lightning.
[59:29.38]Bro, don't... Just let me have this.
[59:31.31]Okay.
[59:31.81]Lightning?
[59:32.91]Life.
[59:33.41]Thunder.
[59:33.69]Okay.
[59:35.95]Um... Is there... Are these the only rooms?
[59:38.39]No, there's gotta be more rooms.
[59:40.17]Yeah, hold on.
[59:41.05]Ten degrees so far.
[59:42.13]Hmm.
[59:43.48]What about this?
[59:44.10]Is this a door we can open?
[59:45.88]I can't because my hands are full, but can someone check out these doors?
[59:50.00]Oh, it opens.
[59:50.98]Well, now that makes a whole lot more sense.
[59:53.67]I was going to say, this is a pretty small map.
[59:56.75]Oh, there's a staircase downstairs.
[59:58.11]Oh, God.
[59:59.65]Alright.
[60:02.94]Stop.
[60:03.24]Don't push me.
[60:05.26]I'm sorry.
[60:06.50]Like this.
[60:13.12]I found... wet wipes.
[60:16.68]Oh wait, no, that's just... nevermind.
[60:19.14]Are you here?
[60:19.66]Give us a sign.
[60:20.34]What was that?
[60:23.11]Was that me?
[60:24.25]Oh, it's locked.
[60:26.25]Okay, okay, okay.
[60:28.25]Alright, back up.
[60:29.65]Alright, so the basement... We don't have to worry about the basement.
[60:39.16]okay in real life lads how scared would you be that now that is spooky as we got a crucifix we've got uh oh man what sacrifice written it's like that place in uh was it winter hold in skyrim
[61:01.10]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[61:02.74]Except demonic.
[61:04.32]What's this thing down here?
[61:07.34]It's like a music box and it's circled.
[61:09.46]I'm sure nothing bad will happen if I... Oh, you didn't just... Why would you do that?
[61:17.26]Why would you do that?
[61:19.00]Do you like this music, Ghost?
[61:20.78]Can you please answer me?
[61:24.02]I'm sitting back here.
[61:25.32]I know what's going to happen.
[61:26.12]We're going to get the...
[61:27.97]It's time to play.
[61:29.19]Here it comes.
[61:34.95]What was that?
[61:37.70]It's still blue, guys.
[61:38.94]There's no ghost.
[61:40.18]There's no ghost.
[61:41.18]Okay.
[61:41.64]Okay.
[61:42.32]Not Elmo.
[61:43.02]Elmo wants to play.
[61:45.10]No, it's like... That's pretty good.
[61:49.34]It was supposed to be like, oh, the scary little girl ghost, right?
[61:53.20]I think so.
[61:58.16]Oh.
[61:59.28]UV light.
[61:59.78]Got it.
[62:00.12]Okay.
[62:00.48]There's like knocked over sconces.
[62:02.36]I'm kind of surprised this place hasn't burned to the ground by now.
[62:06.50]Yeah.
[62:06.84]Ah, the Lord's word.
[62:11.06]There's a re-claw mark here.
[62:14.60]There's a claw mark of swiping claw and blood.
[62:18.50]Oh.
[62:20.32]I'm pretty sure that's for decoration.
[62:22.49]I think it might be an animal.
[62:24.17]Oh, okay, this is like a Halloween thing.
[62:25.79]Yeah, the ghost is actually a jaguar.
[62:28.43]Wait, what you mean to say is that this asylum has been turned into a spirit Halloween?
[62:35.64]As is the fate of any abandoned building.
[62:40.74]Ross, I think I told... I heard something outside, by the way, guys.
[62:44.61]The Fallout set I showed you?
[62:46.27]Like, where it was?
[62:48.01]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[62:49.11]You know, like where they filmed some of the Fallout show?
[62:51.07]It's now a spirit Halloween.
[62:56.26]Of course.
[62:56.68]Of course it is.
[62:59.08]It's getting colder.
[63:00.80]6.6 degrees Celsius right now.
[63:04.32]Dropping rapidly.
[63:05.08]4.4.
[63:05.10]4.4.
[63:05.89]Do I light the candle now?
[63:09.57]There's a... Going back.
[63:12.11]9.1.
[63:12.69]Wait, wait.
[63:14.63]What just happened?
[63:16.49]The temperature is going all over the place.
[63:17.87]We're at 5.5.
[63:18.73]Yes, that's a piece of evidence.
[63:19.91]We need that for the ghost.
[63:22.11]Rapidly changing temperature.
[63:24.82]In your evidence, write down freezing temperatures.
[63:27.66]Sorry, I'm clicking.
[63:29.36]I only have one free hand.
[63:31.28]Yeah, it's going from like 4.5 to like 9.0 to like 4.1.
[63:36.90]It's jumping all over the place.
[63:38.84]If it went down that cold, that's... No, it has to go below zero.
[63:42.28]Yeah, we're not at zero yet.
[63:44.28]Okay, never mind.
[63:45.20]Well, I guess we might be close then.
[63:48.32]Fluctuating temperatures.
[63:49.32]Is that in the evidence anywhere?
[63:50.32]No.
[63:52.60]Sadly.
[63:53.83]But we must be close.
[63:55.57]Should we open the door?
[63:56.25]Either that or it just tried to kill us and it couldn't find us.
[64:00.43]Ghost, please answer.
[64:01.69]Hello?
[64:01.97]I'm getting sick of your shit.
[64:05.81]Yeah, ghosts.
[64:07.39]Zombie ghosts, leave this place.
[64:09.72]Zombie ghosts, leave this place.
[64:13.58]I'll be on my deathbed and I'll remember that video.
[64:15.68]Big hallway.
[64:16.24]Ugh.
[64:22.83]If you are here, give us a sign.
[64:28.95]Give us a sign.
[64:29.81]Oh, we found the room.
[64:31.01]We found the room.
[64:35.23]That was me.
[64:36.38]That was you?
[64:37.94]I was so excited for a second.
[64:39.48]I pressed that.
[64:40.64]Guys, I found a book of fairy tales.
[64:43.76]By Hans Christian Andersen.
[64:46.52]Yeah, I love how there's just a shower running the entire time we're walking around here.
[64:53.56]That white noise is good for me.
[64:55.02]I like it.
[64:56.00]Yeah, that's why I keep it on.
[64:57.44]I know it's not a good idea, but I do it anyway.
[65:01.80]Do you hear that?
[65:02.46]I hope so.
[65:06.73]Oh, it's definitely raining, yeah.
[65:09.57]Weird.
[65:09.87]I was so excited, I thought we found the room.
[65:13.74]Wait, temperature check.
[65:15.48]Oh, more, uh, Deckard drinks.
[65:17.88]Seven, 5.3.
[65:18.08]10.2, this isn't fluctuating.
[65:18.90]Is it?
[65:19.22]5.5, 10.0.
[65:19.26]6.3.
[65:20.58]Try moving to different parts of the room, see if it gets really cold.
[65:34.37]10.4.
[65:34.41]4.8 in the corner here.
[65:35.77]10.1 in the corner.
[65:39.08]It's going from like 10 to 3 to 4 to 10.
[65:40.18]That's a big change, isn't it?
[65:41.02]This door is glitched.
[65:41.92]Why is this door like comically huge?
[66:02.60]Is anyone else seeing how big this door is?
[66:06.36]It is kind of big.
[66:09.04]This is Andre the Giant's bedroom.
[66:11.12]No, seriously.
[66:12.08]Is it reaching the ceiling for you guys?
[66:14.02]No, no.
[66:14.88]I think you got a silly door.
[66:17.20]You have a silly door.
[66:19.82]I swear I have a Monty Python-esque door.
[66:21.94]It's really wacky.
[66:26.52]Hello, ghost.
[66:31.11]You sound like I sounded two days ago.
[66:32.51]Hold on.
[66:35.37]Do I look like I'm in the washing machine?
[66:37.29]Anything?
[66:38.19]You do.
[66:38.57]You sure do.
[66:40.07]5.1 stock.
[66:40.33]Oh, it's like that scene in Better Call Saul, Vinny.
[66:43.47]See, he's Gus.
[66:44.69]Wait, wait, wait.
[66:45.33]I haven't seen past the first episode.
[66:48.34]Shit, I'm so sorry.
[66:49.30]Well, there's a guy named Saul.
[66:51.82]I'm kidding.
[66:53.50]I've seen past the second season.
[66:55.26]Okay.
[66:57.70]Past the second season.
[66:58.70]Okay, well.
[67:00.78]Uh... Past the first episode, it's like, alright, so you just literally haven't even seen the show.
[67:06.76]Okay.
[67:08.46]Yeah.
[67:10.43]I saw the first episode five years ago once.
[67:16.43]I watched it when it premiered.
[67:21.55]Uh-oh, I lost everybody.
[67:24.81]Uh, I lost everybody.
[67:25.68]Where do I go?
[67:26.96]Oh.
[67:31.92]Oh, thank God.
[67:37.91]Can we just, like, turn the lights on, maybe?
[67:40.63]8.3.
[67:41.31]No, it's not cold.
[67:43.09]Well, hold on.
[67:44.95]Yeah.
[67:46.29]4.5.
[67:46.39]Every time I think I hear a noise, it's just, like, some object.
[67:56.59]Yeah, something's moving.
[68:02.21]Still nothing, huh?
[68:03.33]No EMF or anything?
[68:05.05]Yeah, and I got no... Oh, my flashlight just... Uh-oh.
[68:09.01]...flipped in and out.
[68:11.77]Temperature check.
[68:13.67]Temperature check.
[68:15.17]EMF's still on blue.
[68:16.45]We're fine.
[68:17.64]Ten.
[68:18.26]What's that?
[68:18.78]That's thunder.
[68:19.42]That's thunder.
[68:20.00]That's thunder.
[68:21.14]I was going to hold the cross out.
[68:28.53]Remember to drop it, if there's a spooky ghost.
[68:30.97]Oh, actually, actually drop it on the ground?
[68:32.94]You have to drop it on the ground, yeah, that's how I died before, I didn't drop it.
[68:36.10]Okay.
[68:36.34]Yeah.
[68:36.70]That's very good info.
[68:40.04]This, this gotta be it.
[68:42.72]This little room?
[68:43.48]Come on.
[68:44.24]Come on, ghost.
[68:44.68]It's like, that was mine.
[68:46.74]What do you even store in here?
[68:50.22]ghosts.
[68:51.64]As soon as you're getting attacked, whoever has the smudge sticks, as soon as you're getting attacked, just immediately pull out the smudge stick and smudge.
[68:58.63]No matter what happens.
[69:00.49]We're locked in.
[69:02.51]We're locked in.
[69:03.13]We're locked in.
[69:04.17]We're locked in.
[69:04.89]Pull it back.
[69:05.85]Pull it back.
[69:06.92]There you go.
[69:10.26]Funny door.
[69:11.62]There's some funny doors in this game.
[69:17.26]This door opens too.
[69:18.76]I'm I just don't need to be here the fourth person here, and I just don't know how to open a door I'm like we're locked in we're locked in it's like no you just didn't open It's push not pull yo there's gherkins in here.
[69:30.53]Oh shit.
[69:31.41]No go no ghosts, but gherkins Drop in the flashlight when the thunder hits is like perfect Zoinks
[69:46.62]What the fuck is that noise?
[69:47.52]It's just- what is this door?
[69:48.72]It's too... big.
[69:50.64]Uh, Vinny's brushing his teeth right now.
[69:52.56]He said he was gonna brush his teeth for a minute.
[69:54.96]Weep!
[69:55.54]Weep!
[69:56.18]Weep!
[69:56.78]Weep!
[69:59.28]Yeah, wh- is there even a ghost in this whole place?
[70:02.08]Yeah.
[70:02.26]Okay.
[70:02.36]Is, uh, one of the options nothing?
[70:03.34]We've been looking for what feels like hours.
[70:05.54]This is just- you know what it is?
[70:06.36]Is there an option for no ghosts to go home?
[70:07.82]Yeah.
[70:08.48]Yeah.
[70:08.60]It's the scariest of all the Phasmophobia maps, because this is just real life.
[70:12.86]Yeah.
[70:14.65]I think the ghost is a gas leak.
[70:17.05]Do you smell burnt ghosts?
[70:22.87]It's just that's the sound we're hearing.
[70:25.85]Ghost, give us a sign.
[70:27.83]Carbon monoxide alarms failed us.
[70:30.43]Yeah, oh, I think I can smell the ghost, guys.
[70:32.35]I think I can smell it like sulfur.
[70:35.08]There's a small pencil on the couch.
[70:40.80]No ghosts, but... Thanks.
[70:46.74]Where is this?
[70:47.36]Is there, like, a ghost that doesn't come out?
[70:49.74]And they kind of hide and we have to do something?
[70:51.04]Oh, yeah, there is a ghost that's shy.
[70:52.62]Oh, and you have to split up, right?
[70:56.03]Yeah, that could be it.
[70:57.01]Alright.
[70:59.87]But we need to, we don't have any readings, so we have nothing to go off of.
[71:03.85]Yeah, we don't, yeah.
[71:04.81]I was gonna say, I'll volunteer as bait for the ghost if you want.
[71:10.30]Okay.
[71:11.16]It did work well last time.
[71:13.44]Hmm.
[71:16.74]Whoa.
[71:18.30]Have we been down here?
[71:19.00]Uh... Oh, yeah, that's right.
[71:23.74]How would it not be in this room?
[71:26.48]I guess we went through a giant circle.
[71:28.82]This room is like the I am a ghost.
[71:30.67]Uh-oh.
[71:30.95]Oh, okay.
[71:33.57]I'm coming.
[71:33.97]Okay, good.
[71:34.21]I didn't want you to get lost again.
[71:44.41]Do we have any cameras or anything?
[71:46.55]We do, we just... There's no reason to set it up if we have no idea where it is.
[71:52.77]Okay, let's... Oh, what?
[71:54.09]Yeah, we're at zero sanity.
[71:55.09]There's activity at ten.
[71:56.77]What?
[71:58.47]What happened?
[71:59.89]Didn't do anything.
[72:08.13]We just all went crazy in there.
[72:11.00]I mean... I don't feel any different.
[72:15.30]Should we just take pills?
[72:20.76]I guess I'm taking a fucking pill then, alright.
[72:29.20]So there's activity, you said, at 10.
[72:33.14]Yeah, it said the activity was at 10, like, so, right here.
[72:36.42]Somebody said we should check downstairs.
[72:38.68]So, we were probably on the verge of, of... Okay.
[72:42.36]We were right there.
[72:42.98]I just spilled coffee all over me.
[72:48.30]I don't care.
[72:56.01]Is anybody there?
[72:59.99]It's not that much.
[73:05.92]Hello?
[73:06.46]Is there anybody in there?
[73:09.84]Spirit, show yourself.
[73:15.65]We should just lure it out with mean words.
[73:18.41]I mean, we've been down this hallway.
[73:20.33]We need to go down.
[73:21.65]Let me go back to the church, and I'll just, like, separate from you.
[73:25.49]Wait, that's a terrible idea.
[73:27.55]We gotta go in twos.
[73:30.43]We gotta do twos.
[73:30.99]Yeah, we'll pretend to not be in there.
[73:33.22]Yeah.
[73:35.81]So, if you, like, shut the door, maybe?
[73:37.67]You guys didn't try to pull on the basement door, says a chat member.
[73:42.89]We didn't pull on the basement door.
[73:44.43]There's a basement door?
[73:45.67]Where are those stairs?
[73:53.00]That lightning was closer.
[74:00.12]So, where's this basement door that we're... Oh, oh, oh!
[74:02.71]Basement door is open!
[74:06.68]Did we already go down here?
[74:16.38]Yeah.
[74:24.19]Shit!
[74:26.07]I'm starting to think that this was an elaborate scheme by somebody to tell us to all be here and, yeah, go find the ghost while they rob all of our houses.
[74:32.65]Like...
[74:37.23]We're just here.
[74:37.85]I have no idea.
[74:46.42]What?
[74:49.64]What funny door?
[74:52.26]What?
[74:52.46]Okay.
[74:52.92]Oh!
[74:53.00]It extends!
[75:06.28]No way!
[75:07.30]Oh my god!
[75:08.11]Wait, what?
[75:09.73]What?
[75:09.97]There's a funny door.
[75:10.79]Holy shit, this is the biggest door of all time!
[75:14.21]Can you guys pull on the door backwards?
[75:16.65]Like, pull from the edge back?
[75:18.39]Oh my god.
[75:20.00]I just turned it into a wall.
[75:23.46]Oh my god.
[75:24.76]Every time someone uses the door, it gets bigger.
[75:27.74]Yeah, it's huge.
[75:29.18]It's at the ceiling for me almost.
[75:30.66]I'm gonna load up your stream.
[75:32.37]Oh my god, what the f- Dude, what?
[75:34.53]Is it funny?
[75:36.95]This is better than the ghost.
[75:38.43]It's like someone could use the free transform tool on the door.
[75:45.73]Maybe the ghost, maybe the ghost is inhabiting this door.
[75:48.07]Maybe this is what it is.
[75:48.71]Yeah, is that in the evidence?
[75:49.91]Giant door?
[75:50.53]Can we, can we, can we, yeah, put the ghost as door?
[75:56.01]Oops, can I pick that back up?
[75:57.15]Okay.
[75:57.37]Oh.
[75:59.09]Oh.
[76:00.01]The door is now... It is 10 point, what, did the game, did we get locked somehow?
[76:04.46]The ghost just didn't spawn in here?
[76:08.32]This door is now broken for me, I can't actually grab it.
[76:10.90]Okay, here, let me try.
[76:11.70]Yeah, neither can I.
[76:14.03]Uh, I think we're in trouble here then.
[76:16.35]Uh-oh.
[76:17.67]Yeah, the door's... Yeah, the door broke.
[76:20.80]Oh, I got it!
[76:21.28]There you go.
[76:21.92]You got it.
[76:22.58]Oh my god.
[76:24.28]I have to maneuver around the door.
[76:26.04]If I spin like this, does the door look silly?
[76:30.31]Oh, oh.
[76:31.79]It's skitterin'.
[76:33.03]It's got collision, too, all the way through.
[76:35.17]Yeah, oh my... The more collision it has.
[76:55.37]Jerma?
[76:57.35]Jerma, do you copy?
[76:59.16]Yep, I copy.
[76:59.94]Where am I?
[77:00.60]Where are you, Jerma?
[77:03.10]Oh, boy.
[77:05.68]Actually, help me.
[77:08.68]Help, help, help, help me.
[77:11.98]Actually, help.
[77:13.22]Are you behind this door?
[77:14.10]I'm behind that door.
[77:15.94]Okay.
[77:18.07]I can't open it.
[77:19.19]Why is the door locked now?
[77:21.37]I don't know.
[77:21.89]You could try the other door to get into you.
[77:36.90]Where were you this where was this?
[77:45.32]What the fuck?
[77:49.49]Just, uh, drop it on the floor there, yeah?
[77:50.67]And, oh, open it for a second.
[77:51.41]How do you open it?
[77:55.17]I was, okay.
[77:56.45]I did the, everyone that says that I would never do the thing that happens in movie theater, movie, in movies, right?
[78:03.15]Where, oh no, I'm trying the door, I'm pulling, I'm yanking on the fucking door, and it's closed, and I can't open it.
[78:10.27]Everyone says I would never do that, right?
[78:12.39]You've got three seconds to get away from that thing.
[78:15.23]I did that thing.
[78:16.39]I went for the handle, and I tried to grip it, and I pulled as hard as I fucking could.
[78:19.55]I should have just sprinted.
[78:20.25]I should have sprinted the fuck away.
[78:25.31]And yes, I understand.
[78:26.23]I realize I'm in a Family Guy death pose.
[78:28.42]I get it.
[78:28.94]I understand.
[78:30.26]It's funny.
[78:39.40]Well, at least I pulled the ghost into aggro.
[78:43.09]I'm happy about this.
[78:46.18]Alright, can I see the ghost now that I'm dead?
[78:48.08]Oh, I got-
[79:16.57]All they can hear is just muffled Peter Griffin impressions Holy crap Your roommates are watching Family Guy oh That's
[79:48.94]I could have pulled the door off Wait, I could have pulled the door off and just walked away You gotta be shitting me Yeah
[80:15.88]I wonder who she's coming for.
[80:25.79]Who's screaming?
[80:26.69]Hold on.
[80:31.24]Hold on.
[80:42.73]She's right there.
[80:43.11]She's coming.
[80:43.47]No.
[80:43.99]I'm gonna die.
[80:45.36]No.
[80:45.56]No!
[80:54.50]I need to fuck with them, right?
[80:58.34]I need a small plate.
[81:00.68]Oh my god.
[81:01.55]I'm gonna see if I can interact with them somehow.
[81:05.19]Yeah.
[81:22.94]I'm so glad.
[81:23.92]I heard the girl coming, so I just stood behind Liam and let the... Oh, hey, Jerma.
[81:28.40]What's up?
[81:29.00]Hey, what's up?
[81:31.20]I died a horrible death.
[81:35.49]Yeah, that was... It's pretty rough.
[81:38.11]Yeah, that's... They can do that when they die.
[81:40.63]Oh, no.
[81:41.07]They're telling us to check the book.
[81:43.51]Okay.
[81:46.27]So, what did we have?
[81:47.51]Do we have...
[81:51.13]This is so funny.
[81:52.33]Wait, pick up the book if they drew something.
[81:56.81]Did they?
[81:57.43]I don't think they did.
[81:58.03]Pick up the book if there were fingerprints.
[82:00.92]I didn't see any.
[82:01.58]I had the thing.
[82:02.14]Never mind.
[82:04.72]I just died and panicked.
[82:06.36]That's all that happened.
[82:07.28]Yeah, you died in the Family Guy pose and your skull was caved in.
[82:10.76]It was terrible.
[82:11.58]Really?
[82:12.28]All around.
[82:13.10]Yeah.
[82:16.16]There was no EMF level 5.
[82:18.00]It was brutal.
[82:20.26]Uh, they're waving a book at us?
[82:22.12]Does that mean... Do I have a book in my hand?
[82:25.61]This is probably just going to be a guess.
[82:28.13]Yeah, I didn't see any writing.
[82:29.37]I don't even think it interacted with the candle.
[82:31.23]Oh, man.
[82:32.71]Uh, Jim.
[82:36.21]Oh, it's a gin.
[82:37.07]I thought it's a gym Wait, I thought it's a gym to all go stores.
[82:41.47]Let me let me symbol the ghost orb thing hold on I can't pick the shit out of this chat water Based on what you've seen do you have any guesses chat?
[82:48.94]Do you want to do Jim chat?
[82:50.30]I don't know how do we show a lot of people say move it around.
[82:55.28]I'm just checking your chat now.
[82:56.50]Oh
[82:56.83]This thing, this thing, this thing, this thing floating around.
[82:58.69]It's on the book.
[83:00.69]It's all a prank by some guy named Jim.
[83:05.03]Did you see it?
[83:06.69]What's a... Book might mean book evidence.
[83:16.78]Um, please.
[83:17.88]Just start pulling wires up from the computer.
[83:23.89]Okay, they're, wait, they're, they're, they're throwing a, uh, I can't, a ball?
[83:27.51]A ball.
[83:27.99]A ball.
[83:28.58]Oh, they're telling us to look at, they're telling us to look at the camera.
[83:30.86]Look, look, look, look.
[83:31.78]The bell.
[83:37.12]Snoopy.
[83:38.08]Why did that happen so many times?
[83:42.03]I'm gonna go get another fucking weird object that means nothing.
[83:44.61]Hold on.
[83:49.05]Oh, they brought a, they brought a, a, a, a bottle of ketchup.
[83:52.21]I wonder what that means.
[83:56.60]I'm gonna just keep throwing shit in here.
[83:58.93]Pretty cool.
[83:59.57]I like the infinite version.
[84:02.09]Look, you can hit the bell while they're holding it.
[84:09.01]The Salamanca returns.
[84:14.40]Can I bring this plant?
[84:18.98]No.
[84:23.96]Is that like a pen?
[84:24.66]I was gonna pick up.
[84:31.33]Clipboard?
[84:33.53]Okay, yeah, a clipboard.
[84:40.44]I'm lost.
[84:41.10]Are you a clipboard?
[84:50.32]Yeah, a clipboard.
[84:52.06]Where did you find that?
[84:53.14]I don't know.
[84:53.74]Stay out here.
[84:54.31]If I don't come back, you guess.
[84:56.05]I'll be in touch.
[84:57.01]Do you want my headlight thing?
[84:59.57]Yeah.
[85:00.62]I actually have no idea how to take it off.
[85:05.78]Oh, never mind.
[85:08.64]How do I do like a follow me this way, this way?
[85:12.26]Uh, just like throw it in front of their face and then drag it this way.
[85:17.80]Or like just shake it around and then... Yeah, I'm gonna make like a little trail with it.
[85:21.77]Here, you hold the camera.
[85:29.83]I'll... Yeah, you take the camera and I'll... I'm like trying to gesture them to come out here.
[85:38.62]Don't do it, Vinny.
[85:40.42]Take a smudge stick.
[85:41.18]You know what?
[85:42.44]You know, since Jerma and Liam died, I'm just gonna vote for Jin.
[85:48.10]I don't care.
[85:48.90]Oh, no.
[85:49.40]Yeah, fuck it.
[85:49.94]Let's go for Jin.
[85:50.65]Screw it.
[85:51.73]Worth a shot.
[85:52.71]Wait, we get to go.
[85:54.65]Oh, I forgot to vote.
[85:56.29]Jin.
[85:58.09]There we go.
[85:59.54]We got nothing.
[86:00.80]Do we not get it?
[86:07.54]Do we get it?
[86:09.78]Miling.
[86:10.46]No.
[86:12.74]Not Jim.
[86:13.94]I got zero dollars for that.
[86:15.94]I know.
[86:16.14]How are we supposed to make any money?
[86:17.04]I have not got single level or single dollar.
[86:20.26]Oh my god.
[86:22.06]I made 25 bucks an hour ago and I don't know how it happened but it did.
[86:26.77]That map was just too big.
[86:29.59]Maybe it's the difficulty we're on?
[86:31.16]No, no.
[86:31.96]Intermediate's fine.
[86:37.62]Liam, are there any other levels that are like mid to small sized that you have access to?
[86:43.09]Yeah, can you access Tanglewood and Edgefield?
[86:48.17]This game is cool.
[86:50.63]Go long.
[86:53.83]Is there a hoop?
[86:56.38]Yeah, actually up here.
[86:57.46]Here.
[86:57.78]Is there...
[86:59.23]Right here, look.
[87:01.31]Oh, okay, that's blending in for me, alright.
[87:04.50]That's not very... well... interesting.
[87:07.64]Wait, oof.
[87:07.92]No.
[87:08.02]Awww.
[87:08.18]No, I'm good, it's fine, it's fine, I'm just gonna walk around and be scared.
[87:25.54]Look at the twins playing basketball over there.
[87:27.94]That's so pleasant.
[87:29.50]The Zuckerbergs.
[87:35.67]Oh, shit.
[87:36.07]I gotta add my equipment.
[87:37.85]I got it in.
[87:41.17]You got it in?
[87:41.71]All this equipment is still here.
[87:42.81]Yeah, I got it in.
[87:43.37]That's a win for me.
[87:44.25]Hold on.
[87:45.19]I have to do it now.
[87:45.91]Oh, because I died.
[87:47.36]That's fine.
[87:50.68]Yeah, we should be fine.
[87:52.16]Oh, no.
[87:52.44]Lighter.
[87:53.44]I just bounced back and pinged me in the face.
[87:55.38]Yeah, they changed the UI on how this works, so I'm a little confused, but it'll be... I don't like that they changed it to this.
[88:08.92]I don't get it.
[88:10.00]It was weird at first.
[88:12.60]What, they did a big UI update?
[88:14.48]Yeah.
[88:14.86]I mean, it looks nicer.
[88:19.42]Have you guys played the Village DLC?
[88:23.20]Not yet.
[88:23.58]No, not yet.
[88:24.64]It's good.
[88:26.70]Are you still playing Splatoon?
[88:29.38]Ah, yeah!
[88:30.92]You want to play Splatoon one of these days?
[88:32.34]You want to do the salmon thing?
[88:33.98]Salmon run?
[88:34.86]Yeah, I'm down.
[88:35.96]I love salmon run.
[88:37.12]Play that.
[88:37.50]That's pretty much all I play on that game now.
[88:39.28]Except for maybe some ranked.
[88:42.17]It's such a fun PvE mode.
[88:43.93]I got really addicted to that for a while.
[88:46.49]So, yeah, I'm down.
[88:47.65]I'll play.
[88:48.67]I slept on Splatoon since it first came out.
[88:51.69]First one.
[88:54.15]I did not think it was as intricate and fun as it was.
[88:56.18]It is.
[88:57.66]Yeah, it's great.
[88:58.40]I mean, but it evolved too.
[89:00.04]The first one was good, but now it's like the best it's ever been.
[89:03.44]I think you know what the huge turnoff for me was?
[89:05.56]That first game being on the Wii U. It's just that big brick console in your hand and the gyroscope.
[89:14.95]It wasn't for me.
[89:18.80]Well, the gyro is definitely way more manageable on an actual controller rather than the Fisher-Price gamepad they gave you.
[89:24.70]Hey, guys.
[89:27.85]Yeah.
[89:28.13]That door over there, can you go and press that door?
[89:31.15]Okay.
[89:32.23]Press it?
[89:33.83]Yeah.
[89:35.27]What the?
[89:35.87]I don't like this.
[89:42.27]Who are the other people in the lobby?
[89:43.29]Did we invite some people?
[89:44.17]People join off you?
[89:46.08]Chat said go in the center.
[89:49.40]Chat, use a black light.
[89:52.05]Use a black light on the inner circle.
[89:54.29]We have a black light.
[89:55.37]What's up, man?
[89:56.75]What's your channel?
[89:57.73]What's your Twitch channel?
[90:00.93]I think your mic is messed up, man.
[90:03.72]Who invited you?
[90:04.24]Are these friends?
[90:04.88]Yeah.
[90:09.26]Behind the counter.
[90:11.36]Oh, hang on, guys.
[90:13.16]There's a little thing that we have to do here.
[90:14.67]Hang on.
[90:16.64]Alright.
[90:17.30]Here.
[90:17.94]Look.
[90:19.92]Oh.
[90:20.38]It's gonna get weird because we're all gonna be like talking at the same time so I mean... Can you guys like mute your microphones so our like streams don't... I know we're like all... There's too many people in this lobby so... Yeah.
[90:31.19]I mean it's gonna be weird.
[90:32.13]Oh.
[90:32.29]Maybe we could split it off into two different like discords or something.
[90:35.45]It's gonna be kind of weird.
[90:39.36]What's that?
[90:40.68]They're dead now.
[90:41.44]If you stand here, did they do the thing for you?
[90:44.33]What thing?
[90:44.57]Wait, wait.
[90:45.09]What is happening?
[90:45.71]What is happening?
[90:46.29]What is happening?
[90:46.73]Oh, no.
[90:46.85]What?
[90:47.29]What?
[90:47.97]What?
[90:48.67]No!
[90:48.93]They became cum on the floor.
[90:50.11]What's happening?
[90:51.09]That's what I was thinking.
[90:52.27]I didn't want to say it out loud.
[90:55.19]Nothing's happening.
[90:57.53]Oh.
[90:59.21]Hey, dude.
[91:00.19]One of you guys, turn your TV down.
[91:02.94]It's coming through the mic.
[91:03.74]One of you guys.
[91:04.20]Oh, they left.
[91:04.82]They all disconnected.
[91:06.50]Yeah, they DC'd.
[91:07.56]Oh.
[91:08.21]It's alright.
[91:08.63]It's for the best.
[91:09.19]We don't like them anyway.
[91:10.43]Probably hard to do that anyways.
[91:11.45]We'll just do this.
[91:12.57]We'll just do this map.
[91:13.51]Alright, let's ready up.
[91:14.65]I'm confident this time.
[91:16.57]We'll get it.
[91:17.15]I mean, I'm down to play another, like, half hour.
[91:20.04]Is that cool, guys?
[91:21.74]Yeah, then I'll have to hop off anyway, so.
[91:24.58]Okay, so we'll definitely get the... That's like the kind of, like, you gotta back away from the TV.
[91:34.74]Both hands up, face into the television.
[91:39.06]I thought you were too close.
[91:42.42]Okay, smudge stick, and we have to have a ghost walk through salt.
[91:46.24]Okay.
[91:46.54]Ooh.
[91:47.88]Jerma's on smudge stick duty again.
[91:49.58]That sounds good.
[91:51.64]I can take EMF again.
[91:53.54]We don't have enough flashlights.
[91:55.46]I don't think.
[91:56.10]Ooh.
[91:56.94]Wait, really?
[91:57.40]Oh, boy.
[92:01.50]That's alright.
[92:02.12]Well, that's just PG.
[92:03.31]Hey, there's... I'll tell you what.
[92:04.31]I'll use the black light.
[92:06.63]So, who wants this extra flashlight?
[92:08.15]It's right here.
[92:09.61]I'll take it.
[92:10.55]Alright, hang on, I'll put it back up here.
[92:14.93]Did we have an EMF?
[92:16.91]Yep.
[92:17.11]Yes.
[92:17.99]Perfect.
[92:19.14]I got lighter, smudge deck, flashlight.
[92:21.74]I got salt, I got blacklight, and I'll bring... Do you have a lighter, Jerma?
[92:26.34]Yep.
[92:27.46]Okay, I think we're all set.
[92:28.71]I'll bring a spirit box.
[92:30.37]I'll bring the sound thing.
[92:32.27]Oh, you are?
[92:33.07]Yeah.
[92:33.47]Well, I've got EMF and spirit box.
[92:36.33]Oh, do we have a thermometer, or did I... I don't think we have one.
[92:39.52]I don't think so.
[92:41.30]Okay, that's fine.
[92:42.44]That's just one equipment.
[92:43.46]That's fine.
[92:45.16]Um, alright.
[92:46.82]I'm gonna take a journal, then.
[92:47.90]What's this key for?
[92:49.72]What's this thing?
[92:51.78]That's the key to the house, yeah.
[92:53.86]Oh, okay.
[92:55.10]Oh...
[92:56.78]So remember, we have to have a ghost walk through salt, and we have to use the smudge stick when the ghost is chasing one of us.
[93:02.18]Okay.
[93:03.26]Wait, isn't this the baby level?
[93:04.42]Is it the baby level?
[93:05.94]We need a win.
[93:06.94]We need a win.
[93:07.84]We need a win.
[93:08.52]We need a win.
[93:09.98]We need a win.
[93:10.98]Okay, yeah, I remember this.
[93:14.96]This level, I've played it a million times.
[93:16.80]We'll be fine.
[93:17.34]Alright, cool.
[93:18.84]I say confidently, knowing that I'll probably die first.
[93:23.94]Alright.
[93:26.28]I'm going to make a pickle sandwich if anyone wants one.
[93:28.46]Ghost, are you in here?
[93:29.28]Pickle and peanut butter.
[93:31.42]Ghost, how old are you?
[93:33.89]What is your name?
[93:39.69]Getting readings over here, guys.
[93:41.31]There's four knobs here.
[93:42.39]I don't know what this ghost detector is, but somebody can read that maybe?
[93:47.47]I'm over here.
[93:47.91]There's a ghost detecting machine over here.
[93:50.93]It's got four nodules on it.
[93:52.43]I'm just trying to figure out what it is.
[93:56.50]Can anybody read what that says?
[93:57.44]It says gullible.
[94:02.83]It does?
[94:03.11]It doesn't say that.
[94:05.35]Pencil crayons, neat.
[94:16.22]This is a small house.
[94:16.94]There's a chat member that said if we do this, he'll subscribe to my channel.
[94:21.64]Really?
[94:21.88]Alright, let's do it.
[94:23.58]We gotta do this.
[94:24.74]It's on the line now.
[94:29.27]Spirit?
[94:39.67]I'm not the ghost, but I have to say the spirit temple is more fun.
[94:44.41]Spirit temple.
[94:47.26]Honestly, that's kind of a tough one for me.
[94:49.62]I don't even know what they're talking about.
[94:53.08]Oh, you guys can hear me.
[94:55.76]I thought I was far enough away.
[95:05.63]Bartholomew.
[95:07.57]Nancy.
[95:10.22]Nancy.
[95:11.82]Nancy.
[95:12.80]Okay.
[95:14.44]Ghost, are you Nancy?
[95:23.42]Why is this computer so big?
[95:25.66]It is huge, isn't it?
[95:27.26]That's a comically oversized computer.
[95:29.72]Speaking of, let me see if I can make these doors bigger.
[95:32.52]That's a big tower.
[95:37.34]You can fit a 4080 in there comfortably.
[95:39.32]It might just explode, but...
[95:42.46]The connectors might burn up before it explodes, so you might get lucky.
[95:46.58]Yeah, you might get some gaming in before then.
[95:49.12]It's level two matches on Call of Duty.
[95:55.58]Nope.
[95:55.94]Nancy.
[95:57.56]There's a basement, by the way.
[95:58.66]They might be down there.
[95:59.30]Oh, there's a basement.
[96:01.20]Oh, they're definitely in the basement.
[96:04.01]Can we access that basement?
[96:05.29]Over here, I think.
[96:06.65]Yes, here to the left.
[96:08.31]I'm ready with a smudge stick if you want me to use it.
[96:17.62]Don't touch that, you'll get electrocuted.
[96:20.78]What is this?
[96:22.50]Oh, it's for catching flies, I think.
[96:24.66]Oh, I thought, honestly, this is insane to say, but I thought this was the ghost, like, baiting somebody to come pick this up, like, they're, like, I'm gonna grab this.
[96:33.62]Like a carrot on a stick?
[96:34.84]It's like a, it's like tomato soup or something, like, oh, tomato soup, and I'd pick it up, and they would be like, yo, it would pull us up or something.
[96:40.31]I thought this was, like, a thing the ghost was doing.
[96:41.95]Oh.
[96:44.33]I... Well, I mean... No?
[96:48.11]That's gross!
[96:49.95]Yeah, it's kinda nasty.
[96:50.85]How long's this been up here?
[96:53.53]How'd this many flies get in the basement?
[96:57.10]Not even a window down here.
[97:01.64]Bridge?
[97:02.46]Anything in here?
[97:06.35]No, no, nothing?
[97:07.19]No.
[97:08.23]Oh!
[97:08.81]What's up?
[97:09.23]You alright?
[97:09.99]Uh... Mini?
[97:12.33]Mini!
[97:20.33]I don't know.
[97:21.07]Nothing happened.
[97:22.39]You just made like a Five Nights at Freddy's scream sound.
[97:26.70]Nah.
[97:26.92]A little bit.
[97:31.16]By the way, what a franchise.
[97:32.30]Right?
[97:34.20]Aren't they making a TV show starring Henry Cavill since he's no longer on The Witcher?
[97:40.90]Uh, Liam Hemsworth.
[97:44.63]Your namesake is replacing him.
[97:48.31]Where's this ghost?
[97:49.39]What was that?
[97:51.45]I got it, I have it.
[97:55.68]What do you need?
[98:01.21]Maybe if we light some candles, something fun will happen.
[98:03.73]Okay.
[98:03.93]Oh, that'd be cool.
[98:07.07]Let's see.
[98:07.51]10 dB.
[98:08.63]11 dB.
[98:09.75]Ow, my fucking thumb.
[98:10.63]How do I light this?
[98:12.19]Ow.
[98:13.95]Ow.
[98:15.29]Maybe if it's... I'm in VR.
[98:16.69]It might be easier.
[98:17.59]Here.
[98:21.77]Oh, yeah.
[98:22.31]You can light it.
[98:25.27]I'm ready with the smoke stick.
[98:29.67]Alright, and... Smokestick!
[98:31.68]Smokestick!
[98:32.10]Holy shit.
[98:32.78]I don't have the fucking lighter.
[98:33.72]Oh my god.
[98:35.08]I'm outta here.
[98:36.88]Run!
[98:38.56]Run!
[98:39.50]God, no!
[98:40.16]No!
[98:40.40]I closed the door.
[98:43.24]What?
[98:44.12]Oh shit, he died!
[98:45.08]Where's the lighter?
[98:45.75]I can't light the smokestick anymore.
[98:47.27]I have the lighter, I'm sorry.
[98:48.27]Smokestick me!
[98:48.95]Uh, here.
[98:49.43]Smokestick me!
[98:50.21]Oh shit, where'd it go?
[98:54.72]I saw it.
[98:55.46]It was big.
[98:57.52]Yeah.
[98:58.11]Where's the lighter?
[99:01.19]It looked like a naked Slenderman.
[99:02.59]What does that mean?
[99:05.25]It could mean nothing.
[99:06.11]The lighter just disappeared.
[99:07.11]That's bad.
[99:07.57]We need to go back to the truck.
[99:08.93]Right now.
[99:10.69]Okay.
[99:12.44]Run.
[99:14.00]Yeah, the, um... The, uh... I don't know if it...
[99:21.07]What's wrong?
[99:21.49]Are you okay?
[99:22.21]I've got a three.
[99:22.83]I've got a three.
[99:23.45]Oh, you're locked in there.
[99:24.07]You're in trouble.
[99:24.83]You're in trouble.
[99:25.30]Yeah, okay.
[99:26.38]It got to a four.
[99:27.18]It got to a four.
[99:28.26]You good?
[99:28.50]I'm good.
[99:30.78]He's dead.
[99:31.26]He's dead.
[99:32.56]Okay, well, that's your problem.
[99:33.80]Let's just close that door.
[99:34.82]Okay, well, now let's... What evidence do we have, Jerma?
[99:37.92]The evidence that we have, it was a thing on the ground that we lit the candles to summon it.
[99:43.09]So it's a summonable monster.
[99:44.41]That's one piece of evidence.
[99:45.57]Second piece of evidence, I would say, strangulation.
[99:48.65]There's been two strangulations.
[99:50.49]Third piece of evidence, I would say, is...
[99:55.43]Skin if the guy they've got skin, and they're like I don't know that something about it They looked at like there.
[100:01.69]They look like naked Yeah, they were naked um so I saw emf level It only got to four and never got to five so that's not evidence fingerprints Well, I saw it had fingers so we can assume It might have fingerprints Ghost writing
[100:23.94]didn't stop to find out if it could if it was you know we didn't know we could go run in there and look you say emf level five uh no no it uh it only got to four uh freezing temperatures I didn't have a thing spirit box I don't know I didn't I had one but I didn't use it uh take uh shit what is dots projector
[100:52.05]Uh, is that like capturing like spirit orbs or something?
[100:56.39]Or is that separate?
[100:58.39]Probably.
[100:58.77]Ghost orbs are separate.
[101:00.85]How do we look for fingerprints?
[101:03.76]What do we do?
[101:05.36]I think we have to put down like a powder or something.
[101:09.15]Oh, we need salt, right?
[101:10.53]We need to have it walk through salt.
[101:13.41]Should we try to do that?
[101:15.27]We could try.
[101:15.77]Okay, so how about this?
[101:16.79]I'm going to go stand out in the middle of the house and just pretend like, oh, I don't know, where's my friends?
[101:24.08]And then when it's going to show up, just put the salt down.
[101:26.30]Okay, I'll bring salt too.
[101:29.78]Wait, you have salt?
[101:31.26]No, I was going to bait the ghost out.
[101:35.98]It's right here.
[101:36.60]It's right here.
[101:37.26]It's here.
[101:37.58]It's here.
[101:38.62]It's here?
[101:38.90]Yeah, it is.
[101:39.74]Yeah, I'm dead.
[101:41.98]Without a doubt.
[101:42.66]I'm right in front of the door.
[101:44.98]Put this all down right now.
[101:47.10]Ow.
[101:49.94]It's like he had a can of bug spray.
[101:58.01]He looks like he had a can of bug spray.
[102:00.59]Like a can of Raid.
[102:03.61]Where is it?
[102:04.67]Shh.
[102:09.38]That was loud.
[102:10.33]Hey, what's up?
[102:23.40]Your ghost was on the camera for some reason.
[102:25.30]That was funny.
[102:26.48]Hey, will I be on the camera?
[102:28.16]Yeah, I think you will.
[102:29.14]Okay.
[102:30.08]Woo!
[102:30.40]There he is.
[102:32.18]Oh, wow.
[102:32.68]It's Vinny's ghost.
[102:33.44]Sounds like dog.
[102:34.98]Here, hang on a sec.
[102:35.56]I'm going to put on a... Quick floss.
[102:37.67]That's got the letters with dog in there.
[102:40.45]Oh, man.
[102:44.15]Yeah.
[102:44.49]I'm just going to... I have no idea what that... And I don't know how to shake the salt either.
[102:48.95]I don't know how to make the salt.
[102:50.81]I think you just put it on the floor and then... That was so funny, dude.
[102:59.25]You literally were crawling in like you had a can of bug spray in your hand.
[103:02.19]It was so funny.
[103:13.13]I was close though.
[103:14.41]We got money.
[103:16.60]I got $10.
[103:17.42]You got $10?
[103:18.18]That's alright.
[103:19.02]That's the most money I've got all night.
[103:21.78]Oh, $33.
[103:22.89]Oh.
[103:23.79]I got it.
[103:24.09]It's money.
[103:26.83]I got $5.
[103:29.51]Oh my goodness.
[103:31.33]Well, I mean, somebody in your chat, Vinny, mentioned what were they expecting when they lit it.
[103:35.69]I was like, I don't know.
[103:36.75]Something would happen.
[103:38.54]Some action, maybe.
[103:40.40]I didn't think we were going to summon a demon like immediately I thought maybe it would like be subtle I didn't think we were going to summon like you know like a skinwalker right in front of us that was I was not prepared wait this bowling wait what does the bowling work oh
[104:04.85]Does this work?
[104:06.03]It does!
[104:06.53]We can- wait, this Jenga?
[104:07.95]Oh shit.
[104:10.23]Oh, you've lost.
[104:13.55]Jenga.
[104:15.21]That was the move... You don't want to play Jenga, but you're gonna just like humor us and- Let's put it back together.
[104:23.41]And you're gonna be like, oh shit, I lost.
[104:24.62]This will be the rest of the stream.
[104:26.14]Putting back the tower.
[104:27.28]Here.
[104:33.79]Oh, I see.
[104:34.11]Let me add some color to the tower.
[104:36.53]Oh, my God.
[104:37.03]What?
[104:40.99]Oh, it's making like source engine sounds.
[104:45.04]Well, check this out.
[104:49.52]Oh, my God.
[104:49.90]That does sound like Gary's mod.
[104:53.52]Does this look weird?
[104:55.66]I got it.
[104:59.50]You guys want to do another one?
[105:01.07]Yeah, I think it's not enough time.
[105:02.67]Do one more.
[105:04.50]We gotta win.
[105:07.30]We can do this.
[105:08.48]It's still fun, though.
[105:11.67]Do you guys see what's happening to the basketball?
[105:17.55]It's... I see it, like, hovering, jittering.
[105:29.85]Oh, a ball.
[105:32.25]Does this work?
[105:38.49]hey um you dropped this no I'm just enamored with the source sounds over here on the table okay um yeah we can do one more maybe we'll do like um oh geez is there anything easier than that is there is there another easy short one that's like not a house um like what's the one on the right there this the all the way on the top right willow street
[106:06.92]Is that a house?
[106:07.92]It could be small.
[106:09.38]What is this times 18 times 2 thing?
[106:11.44]Is this how many floors there are?
[106:12.40]How many rooms?
[106:13.04]Oh, it's how many rooms are in each house.
[106:15.98]So we did just pick a small one, Willow Street.
[106:18.30]Alright, let's do Willow Street then.
[106:22.08]Alright, one more.
[106:23.46]This will be definitely... That'll get that chat member to sub.
[106:28.96]Oh yeah.
[106:31.90]Let me add more equipment here.
[106:33.82]How much money do you have in this game, Liam?
[106:36.89]Uh, $1600.
[106:37.73]What?
[106:38.21]Okay.
[106:38.84]Wow.
[106:40.68]You like this game, don't you?
[106:41.82]A little bit.
[106:45.02]I have $42.
[106:45.34]Got $17.
[106:45.96]Okay, I understand how the UI works.
[106:50.44]I'm gonna add all this crap.
[106:52.16]Uh, we need a candle crucifix.
[106:56.82]What's happening?
[106:57.50]Hey!
[106:57.80]Oh.
[107:07.91]Why are you in the ground?
[107:08.65]Oh, there you go.
[107:10.41]I'm just sitting.
[107:17.31]Sorry, just finishing up adding all the equipment here.
[107:20.09]I hope I don't die, because I'll lose all this, but... What can you do?
[107:24.62]Am I a puddle?
[107:27.98]No, you're like a... It's very impressive what you're doing.
[107:30.80]...guy running onto his feet while shitting, like you're...
[107:39.03]You know, it almost looks like you got like a really baggy pair of pants and put your arms and legs through both leg holes and put it all the way up and are walking around kind of with your arms and legs in each pant leg.
[107:50.51]It's a very specific mental image.
[107:53.97]I just spent $600.
[107:56.10]Goblin mode, someone wrote.
[107:57.34]Okay, wow, $600 you say?
[108:02.13]Yeah, I added a bunch of equipment.
[108:04.93]Well, we're definitely going to win this one.
[108:06.95]There's no way we're not.
[108:08.75]Investing in success.
[108:10.43]Alright, let's do it.
[108:11.19]Here we go, everybody.
[108:17.01]Alright.
[108:21.24]Another campsite map.
[108:25.08]Let's get that sub, guys.
[108:27.08]What was the campsite?
[108:28.26]We need to get at least that one sub.
[108:34.07]Yo, can we go back and do the campsite instead?
[108:36.71]Because people are saying that one's cool.
[108:39.43]I remember it, kind of.
[108:41.41]Oh, you want to do that instead?
[108:42.99]Yeah, is it possible to abandon this and not lose the equipment?
[108:45.33]Yeah, we just guess immediately and then leave, right?
[108:49.05]Yeah.
[108:50.33]We won't lose any equipment, but I think we'll lose money?
[108:53.97]No, only if we die, so yeah.
[108:55.79]Yeah, that's fine.
[108:56.41]We'll just guess.
[108:57.67]The campsite sounds great.
[108:59.91]Yeah, let's do that.
[109:00.37]I think Jermal would like it according to my chat.
[109:03.29]Oh yeah, let's do it.
[109:09.57]Let's go for it.
[109:15.08]What's that called?
[109:15.92]Chat.
[109:16.62]Okay.

[109:28.53]Okay.
[109:29.08]perfect okay it's a small campsite map the other campsite I played years ago was too big so that's perfect okay alright sorry everyone this should be fun I'm gonna add some more equipment now we're fine we got everything okay do you think I could quickly squeeze a game of jenga in or
[109:52.62]We can play Junker and then watch a terrible movie afterwards.
[109:55.56]Really cool to see Shifter Zerus become a streamer.
[109:57.66]I loved you.
[109:58.16]Uh, thanks.
[110:04.21]Suras.
[110:07.03]Jeremy, you got it right.
[110:08.45]Oh, wait, you did.
[110:09.07]Sorry.
[110:10.13]I just did when you were saying it.
[110:11.87]So you were right.
[110:18.50]It is just a campsite, huh?
[110:22.81]It's like, do you remember Salute Your Shorts on Nickelodeon?
[110:28.06]This will be like that.
[110:28.88]Zeke the plumber is going to come after us.
[110:35.60]okay I got an emf uh what is this thing or I could throw it what's this like this knee pad what is this and just the crucifix okay so we don't need to we don't need to do anything specific other than crucifix and emf and not die so for dots projector oh okay I can live I can take it I'm gonna take this thing somebody else take the spirit box this time I'll take the spirit box where is it
[111:05.62]Uh, right here next to the book.
[111:06.60]The orange one?
[111:07.42]Okay.
[111:09.56]Alright, cool.
[111:11.00]And then I'll take a glow stick.
[111:13.66]Temperature thing?
[111:15.82]Uh, yeah.
[111:17.75]Why is there a camera already pointed at the back of the truck?
[111:23.41]That's creepy.
[111:24.47]Yeah, that's a little weird.
[111:25.33]That's weird.
[111:27.95]We don't need salt or a stick or anything?
[111:32.29]Uh, no, we don't.
[111:33.29]Alright.
[111:35.17]Just the crucifix and EMF for sure.
[111:37.17]And then the rest we can discern as we go.
[111:38.69]Okay.
[111:41.38]We should be okay this time.
[111:45.20]I'm just going to stop saying that.
[111:46.54]Camp Woodwind.
[111:54.01]Oh my God.
[111:54.57]I'm sorry.
[111:55.93]I don't know.
[111:56.23]I just think you guys walked right in front of me.
[111:57.93]I just thought it was like immediately I was getting attacked.
[112:04.92]Alright, I'll be okay.
[112:09.42]For some reason, I just forgot that you were right there somehow.
[112:12.50]I knew you were there, but I don't know.
[112:16.39]What am I looking for on the EMF?
[112:20.19]You are looking for level 5 or anything.
[112:23.95]Level 5 as well.
[112:24.95]Oh, the spirit box.
[112:25.77]Oh, you're just listening for sound.
[112:28.68]Oh, I thought I had the... Who's got the EMF then?
[112:31.88]I have the dots thing.
[112:33.02]Oh.
[112:34.56]Where should I put the dots thing?
[112:35.60]Does it matter?
[112:37.60]Dots thing?
[112:38.38]The dots projector?
[112:41.20]Oh, I don't know what that means.
[112:42.44]I don't know what that is.
[112:43.45]What does this do?
[112:45.45]I have no idea.
[112:46.45]There's a Ouija board.
[112:48.37]We can use that to talk to the ghost.
[112:50.05]Okay, let's do it.
[112:52.39]Okay, that's what that does.
[112:54.29]Can I turn it off?
[112:56.73]What is that noise?
[112:58.05]It's level 3.
[112:59.07]I just got level 3.
[113:00.25]Level 3?
[113:00.59]By Jerma.
[113:01.27]Ghosts, speak to us.
[113:02.59]Yo, that thing is moving on its own.
[113:03.83]That bottle is moving on its own.
[113:04.86]Yeah, that bottle is moving.
[113:06.00]Which one?
[113:07.42]Ghosts.
[113:09.02]It's just level 3, though, not level 5.
[113:11.48]So we can rule that out, perhaps.
[113:14.68]Okay.
[113:15.82]No temperature change.
[113:17.18]It's still like 13.
[113:18.34]Not really.
[113:18.92]It's going between... Like...
[113:24.50]Okay.
[113:25.36]I'm gonna set up a video camera, I'm gonna go back to the truck, I'll be right back.
[113:29.00]Alright.
[113:29.36]Good call.
[113:32.11]Ghost, what is your name?
[113:33.21]Oh my god, they got hands, hands, beans.
[113:39.67]So what are we looking for with this?
[113:40.69]Ghost, do you eat beans?
[113:43.13]Did you die in the toilet?
[113:44.09]Uh... What is this, like an Xbox Kinect?
[113:48.29]What do we, what does it do?
[113:51.39]I don't know, it just, it projects dots.
[113:55.12]Okay.
[113:55.98]Does that help us see ghosts or?
[113:57.58]Ghosts.
[114:02.85]What's that?
[114:03.45]That can't be good for your eyes.
[114:04.99]What's that?
[114:06.53]What's that?
[114:07.47]Somebody out.
[114:08.87]Are we all together or is somebody walking around back there?
[114:12.15]Are we all together?
[114:12.69]I think we all are.
[114:15.44]Are we all at the campfire?
[114:17.28]Oh, the shower just turned on.
[114:18.66]The shower just turned on on its own.
[114:20.48]Did you guys see that?
[114:21.70]What do you mean it turned on on its own?
[114:23.02]There's a shower?
[114:24.90]Ghost, are you taking a shower?
[114:26.20]Ghost, what are you doing in there?
[114:29.10]Talk to us.
[114:30.10]Oh, there is a shower.
[114:30.78]Wait, you get the dots thing.
[114:36.42]I'm not weird, but I'm going to set up a camera in the shower.
[114:41.22]Good thing you clarified that early.
[114:43.12]Yeah, I'm not weird.
[114:43.86]Just so everybody knows.
[114:46.10]Okay.
[114:49.40]Ghost, why don't you speak to me now and tell me why you turned on the shower.
[114:52.52]Can you shower in the afterlife?
[114:56.28]Oh, okay.
[114:57.54]There we go.
[114:58.16]Why is it not on when I put it down?
[115:03.68]You want to turn it to facing the, facing the, uh, ghost, that hot, hot ghost action?
[115:10.05]Yeah.
[115:12.71]Ghost shower scene.
[115:15.69]What's that?
[115:15.99]I hear crunching.
[115:20.68]That could be us just walking.
[115:22.40]Perhaps.
[115:25.50]Maybe the ghost is eating Cheerios.
[115:26.80]I don't know.
[115:27.96]What's that, then?
[115:29.56]Oh, you're... Oh, okay.
[115:32.32]Today's gonna be the day that I'm gonna throw it back to you.
[115:42.83]Said maybe.
[115:43.71]That's right.
[115:46.65]It's weird that, like, your name is Liam, you know?
[115:50.19]Yeah, that's weird.
[115:52.42]Can we turn the... Can we light the fire?
[115:55.78]We start the campfire or no?
[115:58.06]Because when we did our interview, like we talked about Liam Gallagher for like 10 minutes for no reason.
[116:04.41]Well, no, because your name is Liam.
[116:08.07]Oh, yeah, right.
[116:08.65]Yeah, I remember that.
[116:11.03]I am Liam Gallagher.
[116:12.77]But you're also going to be in The Witcher.
[116:15.91]Yeah, that's right.
[116:16.43]Yeah, I am.
[116:17.15]I just got the call from Netflix.
[116:19.51]Netflix is telling you they want to chill.
[116:23.73]This is not a time to be messing around and making jokes.
[116:26.73]There's a ghost here.
[116:28.02]Alright.
[116:35.26]Ghosts, speak to us.
[116:36.82]It's minus 7, right?
[116:37.70]It's minus 11.
[116:38.22]I'm going to write it down.
[116:40.20]Freezing temperatures.
[116:42.72]Freezing temperatures for sure.
[116:45.17]Speak to us.
[116:48.23]Does anybody have a UV light for the journal?
[116:50.85]I got one over here.
[116:53.02]Journal?
[116:53.96]Uh, UV light.
[116:56.02]If you have a journal, put it in the shower.
[116:58.16]Yeah.
[116:58.52]UV light in the shower?
[116:59.28]That's the first time anyone has said that sentence.
[117:01.62]What do you want to do with the UV light?
[117:02.90]Uh, just look for fingerprints.
[117:06.66]Oh.
[117:06.76]I don't see any, though.
[117:07.76]I just threw it into the... Yeah, like, don't do that.
[117:09.84]That's a glow stick, actually.
[117:12.71]Can you hear anything?
[117:14.05]Will it show?
[117:15.72]Yeah, on the walls if you look around.
[117:17.81]I'm pretty sure, I don't know if the glow stick reveals fingerprints.
[117:20.99]I'm pretty sure the UV light does that.
[117:22.67]No.
[117:26.09]Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, cold.
[117:28.05]I had cold breath right over there.
[117:30.05]Oh, right there?
[117:31.51]Okay, that's where the ghost is.
[117:32.99]It's not the shower.
[117:33.85]Ghost is here somewhere.
[117:39.23]What's that?
[117:43.78]I dropped the temperature gun because I figured we don't really need it anymore.
[117:47.76]We got that.
[117:48.84]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[117:50.72]I'll be right back.
[117:51.56]I'm going to go get some more evidence.
[117:53.14]Post, can you speak?
[117:54.66]I'm trying to communicate with you.
[117:57.64]Please, call me.
[118:03.75]We can rule out the shower, by the way.
[118:06.63]Nothing there.
[118:07.49]I got a book.
[118:08.05]Do you want to throw it in the book anywhere?
[118:11.37]I got the dots.
[118:13.71]Move the dots.
[118:14.39]Alright, I'm going to put the dots over here.
[118:17.07]There should be a camera on a tripod.
[118:23.51]Camera on a tripod.
[118:24.91]Ghost, how do you hear about the Breaker Chief?
[118:29.74]Sorry, I was in my own world for a second.
[118:31.62]What was your question?
[118:34.34]How do you open the book?
[118:36.26]Oh, you have to press F on a surface.
[118:45.35]So as far as I can tell, no ghost orbs, by the way.
[118:48.53]I'm just looking at it now, there's no ghost orbs.
[118:50.91]Who's my little diaper chief?
[118:55.34]No.
[118:56.86]So should I get rid of the DOS projector?
[118:59.90]No, I think we can leave it there.
[119:01.54]I don't think it'll scare the ghost off.
[119:02.94]We can go back to the truck and see if we see anything.
[119:05.99]Oh, hey diaper chief.
[119:15.50]So, it's either a demon, a moroi, or the mimic.
[119:19.78]Good bit.
[119:20.68]You know what, Vinny?
[119:21.23]I do too.
[119:21.77]It's just gross.
[119:24.55]Wait, wait, so you said it could be four things?
[119:30.16]So it's four things?
[119:32.55]It's either the demon, the moroi, or the mimic.
[119:36.39]Why don't we all just pick a different one, and then we'll at least get a partial win.
[119:41.65]Listen, I need that sub.
[119:44.04]Oh, that's true.
[119:46.24]Okay, so what do those four ghosts do that we should be looking for?
[119:53.18]Do they make some kind of sound?
[119:54.48]Do they make some kind of noise?
[119:57.29]Do they leave fingerprints?
[120:01.75]Let's see.
[120:05.59]So what did you say it could be?
[120:08.35]It's either a demon, Maroi, or the mimic.
[120:12.15]Alright, so we're looking for ghost writing.
[120:14.15]Did we get any spirit box readings at all?
[120:17.34]Like, did it say anything to you, Vinny?
[120:21.40]No, it doesn't want to talk to me.
[120:23.61]Okay.
[120:24.79]Did we have a UV light?
[120:27.17]Yeah, we need to find fingerprints.
[120:29.93]We can rule out two of these if we rule out fingerprints.
[120:32.59]Wait, did you turn on the generator?
[120:34.23]The generator just turned on.
[120:35.49]That was Vinny, I think.
[120:37.49]Oh, okay.
[120:40.43]Vinny turned it off.
[120:41.45]Oh, I'm dead.
[120:41.99]What?
[120:42.51]What?
[120:42.77]How?
[120:44.37]How did that happen?
[120:46.89]What?
[120:53.44]Honestly, which one of you two did that?
[120:55.58]Because there was no ghost.
[120:58.63]I was further away.
[121:02.67]Oh my god.
[121:05.37]Whoa, Gumby.
[121:08.61]Holy shit.
[121:10.38]Why did you kill our friend Ross and my framerates?
[121:16.52]Alright, well that was...
[121:19.88]Okay, the Dots Protector's down too, right?
[121:22.00]Nothing?
[121:22.32]It's right here.
[121:23.16]What are we looking for in the Dots Protector?
[121:24.86]I don't know.
[121:26.64]We need to find fingerprints.
[121:29.12]Where's the UV light?
[121:30.86]I got a crucifix.
[121:33.53]I don't think we have a UV light.
[121:35.45]We don't have a UV light.
[121:37.31]I thought we did.
[121:38.11]Can the glow stick look for fingerprints too, or am I totally wrong?
[121:42.19]That's what we were trying to figure out.
[121:44.34]Yeah, I figured you could only... I don't know.
[121:50.66]well uh I think I don't know we might have to leave the chance hey this cross is uh with the crucifix this I looks like it oh they just yeah oh yeah oh oh hello so it looks like we got it yeah um I just brought the crucifix and we should go to the truck truck
[122:13.73]uh before anybody else dies yeah you're weird they closed the gate oh the gate's closed well just jump it man it's here it's here there it is there it is I think there it is it's on the ground it's on the ground it's crawling on the ground it's crawling in the ground it's crawling in the ground it's got me Jesus it's so it's so loud and I turned it down
[122:44.72]Hey, what's up, man?
[122:45.50]What's up?
[122:47.72]It crawls on the ground.
[122:50.28]Yeah, it crawls on the ground like a little goblin and chokes.
[122:54.54]No one has escaped.
[122:56.71]We're at zero sanity.
[122:57.85]Alright.
[122:58.25]The only way we can see this...
[123:03.38]People saying, hey, why didn't you do anything?
[123:05.89]The ghost was attacking and you didn't do anything.
[123:07.61]And I'm sitting there just trying to give info, right?
[123:11.11]I know I'm dead.
[123:12.19]So I'm sitting there going, crawling on the ground, looks like it's a demon, and I'm dead.
[123:16.19]But they have that info.
[123:19.73]My job is to make sure they get that info.
[123:23.18]So we got freezing temperatures, right?
[123:25.04]We definitely got freezing temperature?
[123:28.38]We got EMF level 5 or no?
[123:30.40]No.
[123:31.83]Basically, I ruled out ghost orbs in EMF level 5 because I didn't see... I think it's a demon.
[123:36.21]Well, first of all, it wouldn't go beyond 3.
[123:38.39]And the ghost orbs just aren't showing up on the monitor, so... We just didn't do any fingerprints.
[123:42.97]I think it's a demon.
[123:43.93]I don't know how to look for stuff in the DOS projector, though.
[123:46.59]Yeah, I didn't see anything.
[123:51.47]Chat?
[123:52.71]Did you see any... You're winning, son.
[123:56.39]You gave him the info.
[123:57.38]Yeah.
[123:59.78]If you click twice...
[124:02.38]So no spirit box either.
[124:03.46]Oh, it's the demon.
[124:05.96]Does that look like... I'd say demon too.
[124:08.11]Yeah, it just ruled out... After ruling out three of the types of evidence, it just gave me the demon as one of the possible answers.
[124:13.45]Let me see the demon.
[124:14.39]Demons are aggressive.
[124:16.33]Don't attack without reason.
[124:17.53]They enjoy the thrill of the hunt.
[124:19.19]They initiate hunts more often.
[124:20.69]Demons fear the crucifix and will be less aggressive in your one.
[124:24.03]So that makes sense.
[124:25.25]Yeah, it did blow it up.
[124:27.45]It would have been fingerprints, ghost writing, and freezing temperatures.
[124:30.51]So I guess...
[124:32.09]If we found... Did we not bring a book?
[124:34.45]Or did we place it somewhere else?
[124:36.07]Uh, I don't know.
[124:37.05]The only thing we could do now is search for fingerprints.
[124:39.13]We had a book.
[124:39.67]But I didn't see... Oh, only UV light, I don't think.
[124:42.45]We do, it's the thing.
[124:44.13]Do we have any pills?
[124:45.07]No.
[124:45.61]Oh, fuck.
[124:46.03]I think it's on the ground somewhere.
[124:47.65]I'm gonna guess... I think it's demon.
[124:51.12]Fuck it, I'm gonna guess demon.
[124:52.84]Yeah, I'm gonna guess demon based on what I've ruled out here.
[124:55.76]Alright.
[124:56.84]We did get some objectives.
[124:57.88]That was actually kind of successful.
[125:00.78]Alright, let's get the money.
[125:02.48]It's alright.
[125:04.84]We got this, I think.
[125:07.53]I think we still win.
[125:08.29]I can taste that sub.
[125:09.97]That's a win.
[125:13.91]Is it?
[125:19.43]Fuck, it was a shade.
[125:20.59]What?
[125:22.18]Aww.
[125:23.92]EMF.
[125:25.34]It was a shade.
[125:27.36]It was none of the things that I was.
[125:31.76]Alright.
[125:33.96]Well.
[125:34.68]No sub.
[125:39.35]Shit.
[125:39.79]Damn.
[125:41.71]Shade.
[125:42.09]Okay.
[125:43.93]Once you start getting the hang of this, this game is pretty interesting.
[125:46.49]It's pretty fun.
[125:47.99]Yeah.
[125:48.51]I'm stuck in the table.
[125:51.29]Oh, let me make this more accurate to Gmod.
[125:53.38]Hold on.
[125:53.70]I hope that sounds good.
[126:04.98]Cool.
[126:05.26]Did you guys see the ghost out here?
[126:06.47]Did you guys see the thing that's, you know, staring at us through the window?
[126:13.77]Oh, I do.
[126:14.23]Mm-hmm.
[126:15.07]It's like looking like the Mario Galaxy 2 Hell Valley Sky Tree thing.
[126:20.09]Oh, fuck's sake.

[126:24.41]Yeah.

[127:04.21]Someone said they gave me a participation sub.
[127:07.37]Chat members, I didn't actually need the subs, I'm fine.
[127:10.31]But thank you, that's very kind of you.
