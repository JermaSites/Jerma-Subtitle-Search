[ve:61.7.100]

[00:21.56]Hello, hello, hello, how are you?
[00:25.72]Yeah, sorry the.
[00:28.04]Because the way I'm capturing it, by the way, playing on real hardware.
[00:32.58]I'm capturing it through a capture card and.
[00:35.01]It's it's got that weird.
[00:39.92]It's so old that the delay is so long.
[00:42.96]To go from console to capture card to PC.
[00:45.55]I just had to spend like 20 minutes trying to figure that out.
[00:49.51]I think it's fine.
[00:51.16]But you know what?
[00:51.56]Whatever.
[00:51.84]We're playing on old hardware.
[00:52.88]It's fine.
[00:56.18]Let me grab my water.
[00:56.84]I'll be right back.
[01:40.43]Okay, so today you probably saw in the title. If you remember, which I don't this uh ok- let's talk. So I have a 3DO, I have a bunch of old consoles. I was in the pre-stream chat a few days ago talking about this and I got a lot of people that said: "What's a 3DO?" And I was like what do you mean "What's a 3DO?"
[02:08.57]A lot of you don't even know what a 3DO is.
[02:10.94]But, you know, back a hundred years ago, five years ago, I streamed a bunch of 3DO games.
[02:16.78]A bunch of SEGA CD, a bunch of old PlayStation 1 stuff.
[02:22.00]And I said, you know what?
[02:24.12]I think that I want to do it again.
[02:27.17]There are like 15 to 20 games on the 3DO that I didn't even know I had.
[02:32.41]I was actually cleaning out a closet.
[02:36.60]And it was like, oh shit, look at all this.
[02:39.06]There's a ton of 3DO games that are still here.
[02:42.62]And then I've been on, I've been on like a kind of a retro kick recently.
[02:46.46]Honestly, UFO 50 is what did it.
[02:50.42]After playing UFO 50, I remember just being, oh man, I want to, I kind of want to do that again.
[02:57.65]So I made my own UFO 50.
[03:01.07]And let's just do a compilation of a bunch of old shit.
[03:05.00]So I'm going to take my time with these.
[03:06.32]I don't want to rush through them.
[03:08.48]I don't know how long this is going to take, but I'm here today.
[03:12.98]And I might play one for the whole night.
[03:15.37]I might play five.
[03:16.93]I might play ten.
[03:23.91]No, I'm not rushing.
[03:25.95]I am not going to rush through it.
[03:26.89]I'm not rushing through it.
[03:29.33]Yeah, some of these I may have already even played.
[03:32.88]But I don't know.
[03:34.40]Guys, I've played 10,000 video games over the last 15 years.
[03:39.12]I don't know.
[03:40.64]One of them in particular, I know I have played back in like 2016.
[03:43.20]Might just do it again.
[03:45.18]Who cares?
[03:45.71]Fuck it.
[03:51.01]The Dallas Encounter was one of these.
[03:54.35]But that was on a Windows, an old like Windows 95 stream.
[03:59.63]Alright, you guys ready?
[04:01.27]I'm excited.
[04:01.75]I hope it works.
[04:03.64]I'm going to flick the button and it's going to explode and probably not work.
[04:07.50]But the first game we're going to play.
[04:09.16]It's called.
[04:12.80]The Horde.
[04:16.41]I just saw the back of the box and I said, okay, that's going to happen.
[04:18.79]By the way, if you don't know, the 3DO had a ton of FMV, full motion video, actors in front of a camera doing all kinds of weird, goofy shit.
[04:31.07]That's what this system is known for.
[04:33.24]This, the Philips CDI, the SEGA CD, these, this is old school FMV shit.
[04:40.64]And we're going to eat it up.
[04:41.76]Alright, you guys ready?
[04:43.84]You guys ready for some, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[04:47.40]Good.
[04:52.18]Putting on facecam?
[04:53.02]No, not right now.
[04:53.74]Not today.
[04:54.08]Alright, are we ready?
[04:57.59]I'm going to turn it on.
[05:02.49]I'm trying to make the audio levels fine too, so just be careful.
[05:06.43]These are old ass games.
[05:08.29]These are old original CDs.
[05:11.08]I have a limiter here, but just be careful is all I'm saying.
[05:16.74]This dude's shirtless, probably.
[05:18.16]Alright, I need a place for my water.
[05:24.25]Fuck.
[05:26.51]Okay.
[05:26.61]Are you ready?
[05:28.97]I'm turning it on.
[05:29.67]It's been powered on.
[05:42.08]Okay, here we go.
[05:47.72]3Dio!
[05:48.04]Dude, the graphics are so realistic.
[05:56.97]I can hear it chugging away with the CD.
[05:59.95]I'm glad it still works.
[06:04.46]Okay, The Horde.
[06:06.58]Copy, what was the copyright?
[06:08.18]Toys for Bob.
[06:14.46]Crystal Dynamics.
[06:15.55]Oh my god, really?
[06:23.06]Okay.
[06:23.62]They got a juggler.
[06:26.34]Oh, that's not sanitary.
[06:28.22]He's going to get in trouble with the health board.
[06:42.93]So there we are.
[06:44.61]The delegation from Borgo on one side, the congregation from Shmoo on the other.
[06:49.43]Now the high priestess of Shmoo, as you know, considers herself to be so beautiful as to entrance all her devotees.
[06:58.26]Now as the appearance of a large, drowning roadie.
[07:03.66]She, having been bathed
[07:06.98]Somebody's died at this table in five seconds.
[07:09.02]Oh shit, King's dying.
[07:30.52]Hearing this, the ambassador, who's had too much wine to drink... Why is nobody paying attention to the king?
[07:37.44]...and onto the table to defend the honor of his patrol.
[07:41.44]The king is... The king is... The king is cooking!
[07:44.66]...squarely in the middle of a kidney pie.
[07:48.38]Your majesty!
[07:50.46]Your majesty!
[07:52.53]The king!
[07:53.49]The boy is attacking the king!
[07:55.21]Run!
[07:55.65]Run!
[08:01.81]Look at how much food is on this table.
[08:13.13]Ugh!
[08:15.93]Why wouldn't the king just be like, excuse me, I was fucking choking?
[08:20.51]Does the king not know what choking is?
[08:22.11]Okay.
[08:22.87]Okay.
[08:28.72]Chauncey, sir, my lord, your highness, sir.
[08:32.97]And where do you hail from?
[08:33.77]He's dressed like a Star Trek character.
[08:35.33]Well, I have no home, sire.
[08:37.82]I was raised by a kind herd of wild cows.
[08:47.55]Well, from this day forward, you are Sir Chauncey.
[08:53.35]I dub thee Knights of the Realm.
[08:57.07]What is the game, I wonder?
[08:59.21]It's going to be a match three game.
[09:01.31]Just watch.
[09:05.96]It served me well defending the kingdom from the evil, insatiable, terrifying Horde.
[09:18.97]So we're just going to go die?
[09:25.39]That's not fair.
[09:37.04]Okay.
[09:37.42]I love the Looney Tunes circle transition.
[09:43.42]Okay, so we're going to do new game.
[09:46.02]I would like to test something just for a second with you all.
[09:48.30]I don't care if it's like a tenth of a second delayed or whatever.
[09:51.18]Just help me out here.
[09:52.02]I've been sitting here for like five minutes.
[09:53.76]I'm going to go like this.
[09:54.78]What?
[09:55.02]Never mind.
[09:55.94]I'm not going to do that apparently.
[09:58.82]It's turning.
[09:59.18]We're getting another cutscene.
[10:01.77]Okay, that's not, we just got spoiled.
[10:03.87]That's what the game is.
[10:05.53]So, looking forward to that.
[10:08.26]Okay, anyways.
[10:09.64]One, two, three, four.
[10:11.76]One, two, three.
[10:14.58]Is that synced up okay?
[10:16.42]It's the game.
[10:23.38]Is it way off?
[10:29.31]How off is it?
[10:32.65]Do it again.
[10:33.21]One, two, three, four, five.
[10:39.62]One, two, three.
[10:42.94]It's like half a second.
[10:46.70]Alright, let me know if this gets better.
[10:48.94]Because each game is going to be different because it's reading the disk at a faster or slower speed.
[10:56.62]Okay, are you hearing me first or after?
[10:59.24]Oh my god, I don't want to see this yet.
[11:00.66]Jesus, this looks so good.
[11:08.32]One sec.
[11:08.72]I'm one second after.
[11:09.96]Okay.
[11:10.90]So if I go like this, I'll fix it.
[11:13.82]Hold on.
[11:16.34]Let me know.
[11:19.83]Okay.
[11:20.05]Ready?
[11:21.35]No, stop doing that.
[11:22.85]You got to give at least 30 seconds.
[11:27.71]Okay.
[11:27.93]Ready?
[11:29.67]One, two, three, four.
[11:33.33]Are we good?
[11:38.27]Alright, let's go.
[11:38.97]Okay, new game.
[11:46.83]I am Cronus Mela, the King's High Chancellor.
[11:51.55]His Majesty has asked that I give you this deed to the Shimto Plains.
[11:56.64]It's like the E3 presentation and then the game that you actually play four years later.
[12:02.92]Really?
[12:04.06]Trust me.
[12:10.11]Okay.
[12:14.18]Shimto Plains.
[12:18.70]This kind of looks like a sorcery's map.
[12:22.42]Shimto Plains, spring, year one.
[12:23.96]Protect your house and crops.
[12:28.77]What?
[12:29.29]Dig?
[12:31.25]What do I dig?
[12:31.93]Dig what?
[12:32.85]I didn't read the instructional manual.
[12:41.00]Do I dig up crops?
[12:43.52]Oh, okay.
[12:43.76]I just dug up crops.
[12:46.28]I think I got... How much money do I have?
[12:52.10]Is that a demon?
[12:53.86]Is that me?
[12:57.94]Who is that?
[13:00.33]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[13:01.13]Wait, there's traps.
[13:01.91]This is like Orcs Must Die.
[13:04.21]Okay, wait, wait.
[13:04.67]Let's put these over here.
[13:06.41]Right there.
[13:11.19]Holy shit, what is that?
[13:19.77]Okay.
[13:20.81]I didn't put any traps down.
[13:22.61]That's the swag guy.
[13:23.19]That's how you swing.
[13:25.93]Protect the house at all costs.
[13:29.17]They've destroyed the house already.
[13:41.34]To be fair, that is exactly the kind of stuff that that guy in the intro... That's exactly... That's on brand.
[13:51.53]Okay.
[13:52.75]Uh... So... I lost two trees.
[13:57.26]That's 20... I need to figure out how to play the game.
[14:00.28]There was no manual with this one.
[14:01.82]It just came in the jeweled case with nothing else.
[14:08.11]Okay, it looks like I can... I'm selecting... Okay, I'm selecting this now.
[14:12.97]Let's go ahead and do... What about a fence?
[14:14.61]Okay, let's build a fence here.
[14:18.13]That's all I can build for a fence.
[14:20.30]That's literally it.
[14:21.62]I just get... That's a Minecraft sign.
[14:23.32]I can't do anything else.
[14:24.74]Okay, I can't do anything else.
[14:25.64]I have no money.
[14:26.08]I don't have any money.
[14:32.60]What about... Can I dig?
[14:33.36]Yeah, dig up these plants.
[14:35.63]Am I getting money?
[14:39.86]It's not even giving me money.
[14:44.01]It's just not worth any money.
[14:45.41]I have zero coins.
[14:49.29]It's wicked loud.
[14:50.91]Okay, I'll turn it down.
[14:53.53]Alright, I get it now.
[14:55.65]I get it, I get it, I get it.
[14:59.97]Top right, top right.
[15:06.12]That was a much better day.
[15:09.90]I got 42 bucks.
[15:11.82]I think that's what that means.
[15:16.49]Cows are a good long-term investment.
[15:18.19]I only have four coins.
[15:25.71]They're a hundred bucks.
[15:28.85]I can't afford this.
[15:29.93]I could plant a tree.
[15:36.31]Okay, I'm going to plant two trees here and then a tree here and a tree here.
[15:43.87]So that'll pay off later.
[15:46.91]Dig your crops.
[15:53.63]But then I'm not getting any money.
[15:55.29]So no, who said, what do you mean who said that?
[16:03.95]No, don't do that.
[16:05.13]You're destroying them.
[16:11.47]Alright.
[16:11.71]Alright.
[16:11.91]Alright.
[16:12.19]I'm fine.
[16:12.47]I'm fine.
[16:12.69]I'm fine.
[16:13.85]Why did you listen to that person?
[16:15.01]I don't know.
[16:15.41]I just, I'm very easily influenced.
[16:24.53]Oh, this is bad.
[16:25.51]Is there a sprint button?
[16:31.49]Shit.
[16:32.53]Okay.
[16:32.69]Alright.
[16:34.12]Alright.
[16:35.56]Alright.
[16:36.52]Should I start over?
[16:40.67]Okay, so what's going on here?
[16:41.75]So I just wait?
[16:42.49]Winter, year one.
[16:43.42]Chop down trees for cash.
[16:45.24]Replace with saplings.
[16:48.90]Oh, I got money now.
[16:49.76]Okay, I have 10 bucks.
[16:59.04]You're not paying any taxes?
[17:05.21]Put down traps.
[17:07.59]I'm thinking put a trap right here.
[17:08.71]They're going to try to get these flowers, alright?
[17:15.39]Okay, and then I'll put, they always try to go for the pumpkins.
[17:18.74]Pay your taxes.
[17:20.46]What, like right there?
[17:23.52]And I'll continue this fence.
[17:28.87]Great.
[17:30.55]And I'm gonna plant some more trees.
[17:46.12]Okay.
[17:47.26]So now I just have to defend.
[17:52.10]Is this like Harvest Moon?
[17:53.56]Okay, there's eight coming in here.
[17:55.30]Bottom right?
[17:57.20]Nope.
[18:05.36]Oh my god!
[18:06.24]They're relentless!
[18:07.68]Die!
[18:14.13]Did I step on my own trap?
[18:18.53]This is definitely a retirement game.
[18:22.09]Oh, wait, it's time.
[18:22.89]It's tax time.
[18:23.77]Hello, Sir Chauncey.
[18:25.23]Your tax contribution for this year is 20 crowns.
[18:29.18]Due to the recent Bogwart plague, next year's taxes will be 70 crowns.
[18:32.68]I love how his profile picture changed.
[18:35.14]It's always great when you catch somebody doing that.
[18:38.93]You're on their page while they're doing a bunch of profile updates and you can see them cycle through shit and they go to their page and, nah, I'm not into that one actually.
[18:50.73]And then you don't want to give feedback, because you don't want to say, like, hey, actually, the one, like, four times ago, I actually thought was pretty good.
[18:56.11]Because they're like, what the fuck?
[18:57.66]Get off my page.
[18:58.36]Fuck you.
[18:58.74]Okay, save the game.
[19:04.56]Wait, I can buy things?
[19:06.32]The Haunch secret recipe.
[19:08.54]Certain to send any hordling into a hunger frenzy.
[19:11.05]13 secret, almost illegal spices.
[19:14.63]Ring of teleportation.
[19:19.99]I don't have... Look at this guy.
[19:23.89]I don't have any money to do any of this, but... I guess I'll save the game.
[19:33.82]To delete all non-hoard saved games, press L... Wait, you can delete your entire operating system?
[19:40.76]I want to see that again.
[19:43.56]To delete all non-Horde saved games, press L-Shift and R-Shift together.
[19:51.08]So if I press the two L and R buttons, I will delete every piece of data on the console that's not this game.
[20:00.35]That's a wild way to do that.
[20:07.85]Okay, so let's go.
[20:10.85]I kind of understand it.
[20:16.00]I got $45.
[20:18.66]So now should I dig this?
[20:21.66]Or just don't.
[20:22.38]Do any digging.
[20:25.00]Tell me to get a cow.
[20:30.49]No, no, no.
[20:30.91]Don't do anything.
[20:31.35]Don't do anything.
[20:35.13]Don't dig crops.
[20:37.35]So I just need to fight.
[20:38.73]Save money and fight.
[20:48.09]Okay.
[20:49.01]Big eagles destroy.
[20:50.03]You don't get any money.
[20:50.83]Cut the trees down.
[20:51.83]I can't.
[20:52.81]Go cut the trees down for money.
[20:57.99]Alright, so I gotta go cut trees down.
[21:00.48]There's one over here.
[21:18.98]You motherfucker.
[21:20.28]These little shits.
[21:23.77]I still don't understand what's going on.
[21:25.67]I don't think... Okay.
[21:27.05]I'm going to tell you that there's probably like nine people in this chat that know exactly actually what's going on.
[21:32.05]I don't think anybody has any idea what's happening.
[21:39.55]I can get a cow.
[21:54.07]Shit.
[21:56.91]Now protect the cow at all costs, right.
[22:03.68]That's not gonna kill that guy, is it?
[22:07.72]Alright, protect the cow.
[22:12.44]That's all that matters.
[22:18.56]Eight hordlings approach.
[22:20.12]Okay, protect cow.
[22:25.78]I heard water.
[22:28.74]Where?
[22:29.14]What?
[22:30.32]The game is slowing down.
[22:32.34]Get away from the cow!
[22:34.86]Where is he?
[22:36.71]Okay.
[22:56.82]Offcoming tax is 70.
[22:57.68]What happens if I can't pay all my taxes?
[23:04.45]Hello, Sir Chauncey.
[23:07.11]King Winthrop has decided to give a bonus to his most trusted advisor.
[23:12.16]Me.
[23:13.08]When I told him you offered to pay for it, he was delighted.
[23:17.70]you surprised well you shouldn't be next time you send your pants to the laundry I suggest you take out your atm card first oh that was a good one that was a good inner throat laugh that's probably the best I've heard in a long time then at least a decade and why do credit cards exist
[23:47.48]I think that's part of the joke, OK?
[23:48.84]I'm doing OK.
[23:52.82]Should I dig up the tree?
[23:57.20]Ooh, that's how you do it.
[23:59.18]You don't cut it down.
[23:59.98]Is there a reason to not cut them down though?
[24:08.08]Should I not cut them down?
[24:16.62]I can get a second cow.
[24:17.52]I need to fence that cow in.
[24:28.93]I need to get rid of this.
[24:33.22]I'll put a second cow over... No, I want him right in the middle.
[24:50.94]Let's not make it easy.
[24:56.69]I should block off the other stuff too.
[24:59.25]Plant some more trees.
[25:06.67]The trees are actually a great investment.
[25:08.27]Okay.
[25:19.23]It's going to keep getting harder and harder.
[25:25.11]They go up.
[25:28.51]Die!
[25:28.71]Don't you dare.
[25:29.53]Okay.
[25:30.16]I should make some good money here.
[25:33.20]Look at this.
[25:36.68]Plus 138.
[25:55.71]Damn, alright, we're getting another cow.
[25:59.60]OK, I'm going to put another cow right here.
[26:02.28]I'm doing OK, watch this.
[26:05.70]They can't get over here.
[26:13.36]I wonder, is this a stupid idea?
[26:17.03]Right, I mean, it's gotta be at least worth doing.
[26:27.39]Is this mildly stupid?
[26:30.29]But what if it isn't though?
[26:31.51]Because how are they going to get over here now?
[26:33.71]In this angle?
[26:46.56]Is this Clash of Clans brained?
[26:50.16]Okay, so I guess I don't have to worry about what's going on in the top right.
[27:02.25]Okay, eight.
[27:04.59]I'm going to check lower left first.
[27:10.17]This is like a roguelike.
[27:11.09]I only have 52 health total.
[27:16.35]Where?
[27:16.79]Here.
[27:18.37]It actually did work.
[27:23.37]That kind of did work.
[27:27.32]Oh, they got in.
[27:31.27]How did she get in?
[27:32.11]Did she just jump over the fence?
[27:39.63]Okay, I got 200 bucks.
[27:42.24]Tax time.
[27:44.68]Tax contribution for this year is 70 crowns.
[27:53.93]120 crowns next time.
[27:54.73]Is this going to keep going until I can't afford it?
[28:03.37]135, okay.
[28:07.75]Can I afford anything?
[28:12.51]I can buy this.
[28:13.08]I could buy... Alright, I want to make money now.
[28:18.38]Should I get the secret recipe?
[28:20.32]Alright, I just bought the secret recipe.
[28:21.78]I don't even know what that does.
[28:22.64]I think I can put it down and it's bait?
[28:29.05]What?
[28:38.52]No, it's not.
[28:39.10]Where is it?
[28:39.48]Alright, I have a new plan.
[28:48.75]Yeah, come on through the gap.
[28:53.82]Come on through these gaps.
[28:55.98]Oops.
[29:09.07]No, screw it.
[29:09.81]I'm just going to put them everywhere.
[29:36.52]I hear water.
[29:37.08]I don't know what that means.
[29:43.62]Oh, the fence was a perfect place, man.
[29:51.81]That was a pretty good season.
[29:54.77]200 plus 215.
[29:55.21]I'm okay with that.
[29:57.35]Alright, do I have any trees to dig?
[30:18.67]Did you get all the trees?
[30:32.67]I definitely want to get enough money to at least hire the knight.
[30:35.75]Alright.
[30:38.65]Protect.
[30:39.13]I'm doing more cows.
[30:40.09]Alright.
[30:43.01]This is my absolute... I must protect this at all costs.
[30:47.66]Have you ever thought about doing a clam shucking stream?
[30:53.44]No.
[30:58.55]The answer is no.
[31:05.35]I'm going to put these down and I'm going to step into them honestly.
[31:16.39]Hey, if it's hard for me, it's going to be hard for them too.
[31:21.00]That's my thought process.
[31:26.90]Only four.
[31:27.44]That's it.
[31:27.86]There's no way anyone touches anything.
[31:35.80]What's up?
[31:38.35]Uh oh.
[31:44.38]I'm almost dead.
[31:45.34]Almost killed me.
[31:48.28]What do I do about this guy?
[31:49.76]If he punches me again, I'm dead.
[31:53.74]I'm actually afraid of this guy.
[32:14.60]Sir Chauncey's been killed?
[32:17.59]Yes, sire.
[32:19.47]The mighty Grim Thwacker will thwack the horde no more.
[32:25.69]This is a national tragedy!
[32:28.77]Oh yes, poor Chauncey.
[32:32.50]So about his real estate holdings, your highness.
[32:39.30]no what the hell oh man I get it now though I'm gonna give one okay one more one more try what last try I gotta kill that boss I gotta kill the boss
[33:07.59]Okay.
[33:08.71]Now I know how dangerous that thing is.
[33:11.37]Somebody said you should kite him around.
[33:12.59]I'm going to try to kite him into a bunch of traps.
[33:19.64]Get those set right now.
[33:20.96]No, actually, no, no, no, no, no.
[33:21.74]I'm just going to make a ton of money.
[33:23.74]We're going to do a tree planting segment where it's just a ton of these over here.
[33:49.63]Okay, now in literally two turns, I'm going to be able to make $500.
[34:04.48]We're doing cows in the middle again.
[34:05.64]I just know where they're coming from.
[34:08.10]I don't see anybody.
[34:16.32]Okay, top.
[34:20.96]Why am I so slow?
[34:23.12]Why am I walking so slow?
[34:27.00]That was ridiculous.
[34:27.71]Okay.
[34:35.21]There we go.
[34:35.51]Plus 215.
[34:36.05]We're doing two cows.
[34:38.03]Okay, do I have enough?
[34:41.89]Are they here yet?
[34:44.76]Planted a ton of them.
[34:49.72]Yeah, look at these things that sprout.
[34:50.88]Look at this.
[34:51.32]Are you kidding me?
[34:58.78]That was the strat the entire time.
[35:00.01]I don't know what the hell I was doing.
[35:00.91]Is it enough with three cows?
[35:17.18]Can't get that one down there.
[35:18.18]Do 96.
[35:20.28]Come on, I want to do three cows.
[35:23.22]Perfect.
[35:34.34]OK, more trees will be there next time.
[35:38.12]Doing boom, boom, boom.
[35:41.81]That's going to produce tons of money now.
[35:45.67]Put a few more trees in here.
[35:49.11]Actually, you know what?
[35:50.21]Let's do this.
[35:51.11]Get this going.
[35:51.67]Alright, I'm not messing around now.
[35:57.33]Let's go.
[35:59.20]Do the cows do anything?
[35:59.86]The cows generate income.
[36:04.18]Unless it's random, they should spawn from the same place, which was up here.
[36:06.40]I just walked on a trap.
[36:08.90]What an idiot.
[36:10.42]I think it is random.
[36:20.41]Was that?
[36:21.43]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[36:22.13]Where is he?
[36:22.41]Where is he?
[36:22.75]Where is he?
[36:24.25]Is he already here?
[36:24.85]Where's the big one?
[36:31.69]I just heard the big one scream.
[36:45.84]Oh no.
[36:52.17]Why is he shaking his stomach?
[36:57.72]This guy hurts a lot.
[36:59.38]He hurts a lot.
[37:01.76]Well, okay, we have to wait till he eats enough, and then he goes, look at my belly, and he shakes his belly, and you can hit him like five times.
[37:06.64]I got him.
[37:11.86]I got him.
[37:13.01]He just had to eat two people.
[37:13.93]It's fine. 282.
[37:26.86]In the news today, Sir Algeron Plump, the King's Minister of Comings and Goings, announced that immigration is at an all-time high, suggesting that the new Friends Fly Free policy is working.
[37:44.26]Why is that?
[37:55.42]Okay, well that was...
[37:58.00]It's just like a random, like, we're gonna tell a joke now.
[38:01.46]Alright, you know what I'm doing.
[38:04.92]This is where we have income.
[38:06.68]Now we make it so dangerous to even question, even thinking of coming over here.
[38:11.56]Yeah, good luck.
[38:15.83]Good luck walking over here, ever.
[38:23.55]See if I give a shit.
[38:24.27]I don't care.
[38:24.55]I'm just gonna have income generating from the cows.
[38:42.33]You'll hear it if it worked out.
[38:44.59]Hmm?
[38:55.20]Where?
[38:57.46]God, it's so fast!
[39:07.41]Where are they?
[39:10.63]They're eating all the citizens.
[39:18.32]Oh, come on, man.
[39:19.82]What?
[39:28.64]Get off me!
[39:29.50]Uh, I think everyone's gonna die.
[39:37.35]Don't eat the cows.
[39:38.13]Don't eat the cows.
[39:39.69]Stay away.
[39:40.25]I'm dead.
[39:45.55]No.
[39:50.75]How many times do I have to hit you to kill you?
[39:52.57]So Chauncey's been killed?
[40:00.61]Yes, sire.
[40:02.47]The mighty Grim Thwacker will thwack the- Shit!
[40:11.70]Okay.
[40:14.24]So if they avoid the traps, how do- I need like a better sword!
[40:23.42]I could save it for a bomb.
[40:25.66]I need knights.
[40:27.00]Okay, what I needed to have happen is... So now I get the game.
[40:31.42]I understand how the game works.
[40:34.74]I was digging up my own crops in the first three rounds.
[40:40.59]I'm so far behind by the third or fourth season.
[40:43.75]You know what I mean?
[40:48.19]It does kind of look like Bugleberry.
[40:49.25]Yeah, let me restart.
[40:52.35]Let's do a new game.
[41:04.90]The magical eight.
[41:05.78]I love that artwork.
[41:06.56]It looks great.
[41:07.02]Alright.
[41:12.01]But we got a lot to go through, though.
[41:14.59]How about I'll come back to this one.
[41:16.93]This one was very good.
[41:18.21]That's a bunch of claps.
[41:19.55]There's more to see, I think.
[41:20.55]But I do want to try some of the other ones, too.
[41:24.00]Because I've been on this one for like 45 minutes right now.
[41:28.80]This was very good.
[41:29.30]That was called The Horde.
[41:30.54]It was a great one.
[41:31.36]I loved it.
[41:34.91]Okay, we might have to do the audio change again, but give me one second.
[41:40.21]I can go like this because I will flashbang you if I do not.
[41:43.21]Alright, this next one.
[41:51.38]This one's called Mega Race.
[41:54.48]Mega Race.
[41:57.14]It looks crazy from the back of the box on this one.
[42:13.30]What about Webcam Andy?
[42:14.34]Eh, I haven't been feeling it.
[42:19.05]We're going back to 2017 where I didn't use Facecam ever.
[42:27.13]Okay, this one's called Mega Race.
[42:33.09]I don't want to flashbang you.
[42:36.09]Oh, Mega Race.
[42:51.53]Do you have Road Rash?
[42:52.99]I played it already years ago on stream.
[42:56.61]But there's a lot I could just, I mean, a lot of people don't even know I played it.
[43:05.68]Which is really interesting that it's, I guess I have streamed like 2000 times or something over nine and a half years.
[43:15.94]There's a lot of stuff I think a lot of people just haven't even seen.
[43:19.70]Okay, let's see if it's in sync.
[43:21.28]Ready?
[43:21.46]1, 2, 1, 2, 3.
[43:24.60]Are we good?
[43:33.81]Alright.
[43:36.19]Let's give this one a shot.
[43:48.14]I don't hear anything.
[43:50.77]I don't know if I'm supposed to hear anything.
[43:58.23]Do I not hear anything?
[43:59.57]I do hear it.
[44:06.41]Okay.
[44:09.45]Look how futuristic this is.
[44:30.72]Oh, you can always tell when the evil businessman is available because he has a gigantic screen on the side of every skyscraper.
[44:48.48]If I ever have a giant LED screen on the side of a building... I think it's time to slow it down.
[44:57.77]I think it's time to stop.
[45:01.34]And now, VWBT is proud to present the show that squashes reality like a bug.
[45:08.45]That's right.
[45:09.53]You better be ready to mega race.
[45:14.81]Oh my god, this is loud.
[45:17.07]Here's your mega host, Lance Boyle.
[45:22.16]Hey, welcome to Mega Race, the action show where violence only happens once every few seconds.
[45:29.90]Hi, I'm Lance Boyle, and people often wonder if I'm real.
[45:33.40]Do you ever wonder what it's like to race a real high-performance sports guy?
[45:37.36]You know, like the ones those punk speed gangs drive on the freeways?
[45:40.70]Those guys really think they rule the road, right?
[45:43.28]I mean, where do they get off intimidating law-abiding citizens and taxpayers?
[45:46.82]You know what I mean?
[45:47.62]And you know something else you won't...
[45:49.80]Is this guy on the city?
[45:50.78]So you say somebody ought to do something about them criminal highway gangs.
[45:55.58]And VWBT says, oh, yeah?
[45:58.84]Well, why don't you do something, Mr. Big Mouth?
[46:02.37]You don't have the car?
[46:03.57]We'll give you the car.
[46:05.01]You don't want to get arrested for taking the law into your own hands.
[46:08.43]Not a problem.
[46:09.35]You know why?
[46:09.85]Because it ain't real.
[46:11.49]It's a whole lot better than real, baby.
[46:13.91]It's virtual television.
[46:15.86]Reality's white nightmare.
[46:18.81]That was awesome.
[46:19.69]That turn.
[46:20.09]I feel like there was not a script.
[46:22.31]They just told this guy to go.
[46:23.39]This is you in five years, Jeremy?
[46:25.45]This was me five years ago.
[46:27.13]Ago.
[46:50.74]So it's Mario Kart Double Dash, but we're in different cars.
[47:16.41]is a terrifying selection of symbols which signify things like speeding up and slowing up and maybe even blowing up.
[47:23.81]Who knows?
[47:24.35]Who cares?
[47:25.69]You want to know what happens if at the end of the race the enforcer didn't quite overtake as many of these speed punks as he was supposed to?
[47:33.00]Well, we just stamped chicken on his face and sent him home to mommy.
[47:37.68]Yeah, baby, these streets are mean.
[47:41.49]Okay, let's just see if our enforcer is ready to rumble a few bad guys.
[47:48.47]Wait, he's in the car with me?
[47:49.80]Yeah, keep that adrenaline pumping.
[47:54.74]I guess he's in the car.
[47:55.96]You're really scaring me.
[47:59.06]Okay, tough guy.
[48:00.42]No, listen up.
[48:02.49]Is he talking to all of us?
[48:03.63]Or just me to everyone on Earth?
[48:18.01]Wait till you hear this.
[48:20.19]Every time you kill a pack leader, and when I say kill, I'm talking virtuality, not reality, okay?
[48:28.74]In Mega Race, nobody actually dies.
[48:31.48]Everyone's really quiet, by the way.
[48:33.51]You feel a whole lot better about yourself now, doesn't it?
[48:36.45]Every time you kill a leader, you not only score big time, you also win.
[48:41.53]These people at the lake.
[48:43.51]And his customized car are both yours.
[48:47.20]Take a look at this.
[48:49.30]You know what that is?
[48:50.60]Sure you do.
[48:51.60]It's the thrillometer.
[48:53.92]Anytime the excitement level drops into the gray zone, it means the audience is not getting enough of those beautiful white-knuckle thrills.
[49:01.16]And we don't want that, now do we?
[49:03.12]This is a one-take.
[49:04.52]What happens when you've finally blown away the... So these people are watching at home.
[49:09.58]I thought they were participants.
[49:11.16]We take a look at your score and see where your name goes in the mega-race hall of...
[49:17.90]Do you know what this reminds me of?
[49:18.70]I'll talk about it in a second.
[49:22.30]I don't want to cut him off.
[49:26.00]Uh, do I have... Okay, it's loading.
[49:27.48]Okay, well, it's loading here.
[49:28.28]Listen.
[49:29.92]In the beginning of every game show, every single episode, it doesn't matter if it's been going on for 40 straight years, they explain the entire rules of the entire game.
[49:39.93]Every single episode.
[49:42.23]You don't need to do that anymore.
[49:44.03]Do we need a 10-minute introduction every fucking episode?
[49:49.10]What if they have new viewers?
[49:50.10]Get good.
[49:50.74]You'll figure it out.
[49:51.60]New viewers?
[49:52.00]Alright, I haven't been paying attention.
[49:55.87]He has sunglasses on now.
[50:17.49]This guy's just ranting.
[50:18.52]This is supposed to be a public service announcement by the president.
[50:21.59]What's he even doing?
[50:30.23]Here in Nisan, you get to know the vultures.
[50:32.95]They're a speed gang with a lot of rage, and they like to liberate those strong feelings by smearing people across the highway.
[50:40.11]Their pack leader calls himself Jailbait.
[50:43.14]He's seen your picture, Enforcer, and he's got some interesting plans for your face.
[50:48.28]Okay.
[50:49.78]Anything else?
[50:51.08]And this giant public service announcement to Earth?
[50:53.14]Oh, of course there is.
[50:54.18]It's time to select your Mega Race machine, Enforcer.
[50:58.22]Look at those beauties.
[51:00.32]Go ahead.
[51:01.12]Help yourself.
[51:02.08]Perfect green screen reaction.
[51:03.97]I love it.
[51:04.43]That's how you do a green screen.
[51:06.59]Okay.
[51:07.13]Who do I want to be?
[51:11.69]I guess I can pick orange car, green car, or black car.
[51:17.37]That's it.
[51:20.27]I'm going to go with green car.
[51:21.97]I think.
[51:35.63]Ooh, I think sleek.
[51:37.81]Medium, it's called Lewis.
[51:39.17]Medium armored, multi-turbo motor, 710 oomph.
[51:43.90]Warning device, shield capabilities, laser guns, three, no missile carrier.
[51:47.98]Okay.
[51:53.10]Uh, I guess we can take a look at the other ones.
[52:01.50]Is this official hardware?
[52:02.56]It is official hardware.
[52:05.34]Actually, that thing is pretty dope.
[52:07.54]Look at this thing.
[52:09.82]I love that.
[52:10.28]I love that shine on it.
[52:13.71]Heavily armored.
[52:14.45]Five rear pipes.
[52:16.69]This one's heavy.
[52:17.37]802 umps.
[52:20.69]One laser gun.
[52:21.29]The other one had three.
[52:22.03]Not like this matters.
[52:23.59]We're going to crash into the first wall we see and explode.
[52:26.17]And I'm going to change the game.
[52:30.68]What about the last one?
[52:38.00]And let me tell you something.
[52:40.66]Oh, God.
[52:41.12]Okay, is that how that guy would raise taxes?
[52:43.66]Would he just go on for like 10 minutes with sunglasses on and talk about, and we're going to raise taxes because the enforcers need extra money to take on the other enforcers.
[52:52.05]Would he have like a 55-minute sunglasses cartoon outfit presentation to Earth?
[52:58.29]I feel like that would be a great way to present it.
[53:03.45]It's a Batmobile, yeah.
[53:10.96]I think this one's pretty great.
[53:14.44]Strongly armored.
[53:15.46]Oh.
[53:17.98]Okay, I'm choosing this one.
[53:23.40]Did I select it?
[53:24.42]I don't think I did.
[53:28.94]Press P. Oh, P is start.
[53:31.76]P is the start button.
[53:38.08]From now on, you are on your own, Enforcer.
[53:41.24]And as I always say at this point in the show, have a nice death, baby.
[53:47.67]Oh my god, somebody clip that in.
[53:48.75]What an amazing gif that is.
[53:50.24]That's such a fucking awesome gif.
[53:51.54]I can use that anywhere.
[53:52.48]And it's like that with the audio.
[53:53.42]And maybe if you don't even have the audio, it's perfect for anything.
[54:02.14]Prepare to race in... I'm racing.
[54:04.20]Okay, go.
[54:04.74]It's not going too fast.
[54:07.61]Oh, shit!
[54:09.59]How's this for excitement?
[54:30.83]Well, if I knew it was going to look like this, I feel like a lot of people are going to walk up and leave the theater.
[54:37.46]He made it sound like people were, there's going to be explosions, there's going to be giant extraordinary gunfights and stuff and blasts.
[54:43.67]Okay, that was an explosion.
[54:56.58]And so the struggle for law and order on our freeways claims another victim.
[55:01.36]There's like two people on the track.
[55:03.04]So you saw it live right here on Mega Race.
[55:05.65]That was not entertaining.
[55:06.55]There's a sharp horizontal line on the monitor screen of life.
[55:09.83]At some point, you sit there with your whole family.
[55:12.78]This was $200 on pay-per-view.
[55:15.32]You're going to look next to everybody and you're going to be like, fuck, I have to own this.
[55:19.04]I better say we're going to McDonald's.
[55:21.96]You know what I mean?
[55:22.50]I better say we're going to fucking Dairy Queen.
[55:25.05]That's the only way that anyone's going to be happy about this.
[55:31.75]That's a really sad car ride home if we're in attendance.
[55:39.10]Alright, let me try this again, now that I understand what's going on.
[55:52.04]Watch the whole thing again?
[55:53.32]No.
[55:53.50]Alright, I have to win one of these.
[56:08.65]I love this guy.
[56:09.31]He's great.
[56:14.19]Looks like Max Headroom.
[56:15.43]That's who it reminds me of too, yeah.
[56:16.41]Wait, I'm... Oh, I'm back and they're pretending like I never existed.
[56:19.51]Alright, let's go with... Let's go with green.
[56:39.15]This time I have to avoid everybody.
[56:41.11]Or try to stay behind them and shoot them, right?
[56:44.33]Actually, we're doing orange.
[56:48.73]Please wait.
[56:49.23]Okay.
[56:49.35]This time I'm going to win.
[57:10.99]People used to dress like that and go to work.
[57:12.81]What happened?
[57:14.81]Why did we get so serious?
[57:17.51]Okay, I want to stay behind and just shoot, right?
[57:30.72]Why do I have to be so close for the laser?
[57:43.27]It just don't ever be it.
[57:44.63]Yeah, just.
[57:46.31]Only attack and this then pass after you kill them.
[57:50.54]Oh shit, I don't want to be in front of anybody.
[57:52.24]Get out of here.
[57:55.58]Is a red car.
[58:08.88]Oh, I'm at a blaster.
[58:09.82]I don't have any... Okay.
[58:10.76]Oh, the audience is not happy because no one has died.
[58:13.16]Come on!
[58:42.05]Okay, they got happy about that.
[58:43.47]That was apparently very entertaining.
[58:56.08]Die already!
[58:58.18]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[59:04.32]I have to do this again.
[59:11.11]Hey, I got to fifth place or something.
[59:41.42]Alright, this is my last attempt.
[59:43.76]I'm going to do it.
[59:44.26]I'm going to beat this race.
[59:45.10]I'm going to go for it.
[59:46.88]You have a finite amount of shooting.
[59:50.82]So, and I was just spamming it.
[59:51.94]I shouldn't have been doing that.
[59:52.70]Okay.
[60:08.09]You're facing the vultures again.
[60:10.41]And Jailbait says he never heard of you.
[60:13.97]Well, you'll hear about me after today.
[60:18.13]It's time to select your mega.
[60:24.40]Um.
[60:27.62]I'm doing orange.
[60:32.62]From now on, you are.
[60:33.58]Okay, come on.
[60:38.92]I got this.
[60:40.02]I can do this.
[60:48.43]Okay.
[60:52.59]I like the way this one sounds.
[60:58.05]Jeez.
[60:58.35]Don't spam it.
[61:00.52]Just wait until I'm behind him.
[61:12.71]There's no timer.
[61:13.39]So I don't have to really rush, I don't think.
[61:19.36]Okay, boom.
[61:20.08]I think I have three more to get rid of.
[61:38.05]Audience is getting pissed.
[61:39.70]A laser has been fired in 15 seconds.
[61:47.42]Good.
[61:48.06]Okay.
[61:48.66]Green.
[61:53.16]No, I don't want to go this fast.
[61:55.76]No, I don't want to go this fast.
[61:58.62]Stop, please.
[61:59.42]Hit the brake.
[62:00.42]What's brake?
[62:01.08]What's brake?
[62:02.74]What is break?
[62:04.76]Oh, I think he's dead.
[62:05.60]I think he died.
[62:32.95]What the fuck are you talking about?
[62:35.49]What?
[62:35.71]What?
[62:35.95]I have to smash him.
[62:37.17]I beat him.
[62:37.63]Did I win?
[63:04.65]Can you keep up this level of intensity, tough guy?
[63:08.09]Or have you given your all in one spectacular race?
[63:11.55]Viewers, if you're watching the repeat, please don't phone in to tell me the answer.
[63:17.08]I hate it when they ruin the suspense.
[63:20.70]Wait, did I just get a unique cutscene because I'm dead and I didn't make it?
[63:25.64]You just won yourself a prize, Enforcer.
[63:28.42]Come and take a look.
[63:30.24]Say, I'd go for one of these myself if I didn't already have a box full.
[63:36.67]A new car?
[63:41.43]This is a loot box.
[63:42.17]This is the first ever loot box in video games.
[63:46.21]Oh, a fabulous trip.
[63:47.55]Hey, aren't they supposed to be islands or something?
[63:49.73]Aloha, baby.
[63:51.67]Me.
[63:51.77]Hey, fabulous trip to the Seychelles.
[63:54.19]Hey, aren't they supposed to be islands or something?
[63:56.75]Aloha, baby.
[63:58.20]Me, Lance.
[64:01.22]Alright, so I won a trip.
[64:03.76]Cool.
[64:03.92]Cool.
[64:06.09]Okay.
[64:10.29]Uh, okay.
[64:15.45]Now what's next?
[64:16.21]I just, I beat the game.
[64:39.66]I beat the whole game.
[64:47.74]I know I had to have unlocked something.
[64:49.80]Oh, here we go.
[64:50.74]Here we go.
[64:51.34]And their feathers are still kind of ruffled.
[64:55.00]Jailbait wants to see you cut up into bite-sized bleeding chunks.
[64:59.74]Only on a virtual level, of course.
[65:02.27]In reality, no one gets hurt here on Mega Race.
[65:06.05]The show that only looks like it hurts.
[65:10.18]That was a creepy way to say that at the end.
[65:11.86]Do I have a new car?
[65:15.98]I don't.
[65:16.26]Alright, well that one was the one I won with, so I'm sticking with it.
[65:20.36]And as I always say at this point in the show...
[65:39.57]Sorry, I cut him off.
[65:51.05]Wait, prepare to race new San 1.
[65:53.17]I already did.
[65:54.45]I did this already.
[65:55.25]Why is it?
[65:56.33]I actually is there only one track?
[65:58.21]I'm very confused.
[66:09.55]It's because you died.
[66:10.84]Is it because I died at the end?
[66:12.54]Alright, let's do it cleaner this time.
[66:28.34]Good.
[66:28.52]Clean.
[66:28.98]Only two more.
[66:29.72]Alright, where's Vulture?
[66:31.10]Or whatever his name is.
[66:58.43]Stop.
[66:58.69]Remember me?
[66:59.73]Alright, I gotta smash him now.
[67:02.83]Whoa, that was weird.
[67:29.74]Oh my god!
[67:33.94]I don't want to be in front of him.
[67:34.76]No!
[67:39.04]I don't want to be... Okay, this is bad.
[67:52.00]Stop hitting the wall.
[67:53.06]We're going to blow up again together at the same time.
[68:08.50]I'm doing the next one.
[68:09.54]I'm doing the next one.
[68:12.48]Aw, sorry, Enforcer.
[68:14.68]You didn't get the job done.
[68:17.49]It's return to reality time, old buddy.
[68:20.05]Ah, gee.
[68:21.73]If there was only something I could do.
[68:25.53]Hey, wait a minute.
[68:28.22]I've got an idea.
[68:30.36]What?
[68:31.50]Let's call the next contestant.
[68:37.01]Okay.
[68:38.09]I liked that one a lot.
[68:38.89]That one had a lot of flair.
[68:43.27]The next one is... I don't know if this one's going to be any good.
[68:47.35]There was really no art with this one.
[68:49.65]It looks like a puzzle game.
[68:51.61]And it looks like a puzzle game I'm not going to enjoy.
[68:54.44]But we're going to try it anyways.
[68:57.48]I don't want to flashbang you.
[68:58.42]Give me one second.
[69:18.93]I mean, we're really playing these for those 10-minute intro cutscenes.
[69:23.53]That's what we're doing here.
[69:24.55]Okay, this is concerning me because the name of this game is called Gridders.
[69:37.06]And I opened it.
[69:38.86]And inside it says, demo disk, not for resale.
[69:50.05]Not confident about this one.
[70:02.65]Got scammed again.
[70:04.69]That seems to happen with a lot of these pre-owned things, doesn't it?
[70:12.54]Okay.
[70:16.00]I don't think it doesn't say demo on it.
[70:21.79]For centuries, mankind has been depleting the Earth's natural resources.
[70:27.21]Now, in the year 2049, ecological disaster is at hand.
[70:32.48]In order to save the dying planet, the United World Council has reluctantly agreed to enlist the help of the Evil Gritters Corporation and its secret Gritter technology.
[70:44.11]the heartless director of the company has been using this technology to automate operations of the gritters factory until finally on September 5th 2049 the factory is closed to outsiders as the last worker zach is unceremoniously laid off okay so this is 2049 guys it's not that far away
[71:14.77]okay let's do the test okay it went okay well I want to do a test stop cutting me off with sound effects one two three four one two three four we good
[71:40.38]It's way off.
[71:41.48]Okay.
[71:46.21]Listen to this mute.
[71:47.11]This soundtrack is going crazy.
[71:50.77]Okay.
[71:51.07]Are you hearing me first?
[71:53.05]One, two, three, four.
[72:03.68]I'm first.
[72:04.28]Okay.
[72:05.44]Okay.
[72:08.46]We keep getting these awesome beginnings of amazing songs, but then they just stop.
[72:13.15]I want to hear one of these.
[72:16.69]Let's hear one.
[72:17.45]Okay, let's try this.
[72:26.86]Ready?
[72:26.98]No, no, no.
[72:28.52]I don't want to see this.
[72:29.16]I don't want to see the demo.
[72:31.28]Nobody look.
[72:32.68]Everyone close your eyes.
[72:41.83]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[72:47.37]We good?
[72:55.68]Did it improve?
[72:56.46]Okay, it improved.
[73:09.88]They all have different disk speed times, so it messes up the syncing.
[73:13.02]Ready?
[73:14.20]One, two, three, four.
[73:17.46]Hold on, we need to start over.
[73:19.12]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[73:27.23]I'm just fucking going, I don't care.
[73:34.45]Hmm, my last paycheck.
[73:36.26]Hey, what's this note?
[73:39.36]Wow, there's something in the basement.
[73:41.00]Who's this Sandra?
[73:44.29]I gotta check this out.
[73:51.19]So this is where we work?
[73:52.39]This is where people work?
[73:55.39]What do I do?
[74:02.17]What kind of job is this?
[74:04.09]How does this make any sense?
[74:08.04]I have a dog now.
[74:12.50]Well, that's much easier being able to see it like this.
[74:16.04]Where do I have to go?
[74:22.23]What's the job?
[74:24.35]This is supposed to solve climate change, by the way.
[74:27.89]I'm not entirely sure how.
[74:40.21]Do I have to pick up stuff?
[74:41.73]What do you- do you grab something?
[74:53.03]I stopped everything.
[74:54.61]Wait a minute, it's gonna- it's gonna be six in a row.
[74:56.41]Watch this.
[74:57.76]It's like Tetris is gonna- Oh shit, climate change is gonna fucking kill us all now.
[75:22.08]uh okay I don't understand anything that's going on but I I can apparently stop them but I I guess there's only some of them that I can stop I don't know I'm not sure that okay I can stop them this way if I hold it and then if I let it go it'll it'll turn into that
[75:55.33]I think you can only get squished from the top.
[75:58.57]No, I can hold them.
[76:00.37]Okay, if they turn into red, is red good?
[76:04.54]I'm not sure.
[76:05.14]What the fuck is going on?
[76:18.93]Oh, there's a shiny!
[76:21.15]Shiny thing.
[76:23.95]Digital.
[76:36.28]This game is from a dream.
[76:39.35]Yeah, it kind of feels like a dream.
[76:41.49]Digital.
[76:43.33]Wait, do I have to get them in this?
[76:52.81]Director, there's an intruder on subterranean level one.
[76:56.10]Calm down.
[76:57.42]You'll never get past the hunter.
[77:02.66]I think I just beat the level.
[77:05.44]I thought it was a puzzle game.
[77:07.38]It is not a puzzle game.
[77:09.46]It's just a get to the end game.
[77:12.96]I thought it was a puzzle.
[77:19.01]You just have to avoid these things.
[77:23.67]So who cares?
[77:25.01]I could just... It's like Frogger.
[77:27.39]It's not like Connect Four.
[77:29.29]It's Frogger.
[77:33.94]What does the dog do?
[77:37.74]Oh shit, kitboga raid!
[77:42.19]What's up dude?
[77:44.95]Hope you're doing well.
[77:45.85]Welcome everybody.
[77:50.36]We're playing old 3DO games today.
[77:52.36]I'm on my 3DO.
[77:56.04]This one is an absolute banger.
[77:58.00]This one's called... Beating AI tons of data and then telling it to come up with something.
[78:08.20]And then sitting there and going, nice.
[78:11.27]The only thing that's missing is Elmo.
[78:15.67]Elmo in like a mobster suit.
[78:19.91]As if he was in the Sopranos movie.
[78:21.55]I'm like...
[78:36.04]Come on.
[78:36.80]Where's the exit?
[78:39.52]Thanks.
[78:40.72]Long time no talk, dude.
[78:41.80]We should catch up soon.
[78:42.46]Hope you're doing good.
[78:50.16]What is the point of the dog?
[78:52.80]Has anybody figured that out yet?
[79:01.85]Oh, it's not lit up yet.
[79:02.81]How do you light it up?
[79:03.79]Do I have to do something?
[79:05.09]How do you light this thing up?
[79:14.50]The dog is just a friend?
[79:15.80]I like the sounds.
[79:18.78]The music's good.
[79:21.60]Maybe collect all the digital things.
[79:23.24]Oh.
[79:34.68]Yeah.
[79:40.22]He'll never get through this part.
[79:44.16]Yeah, yeah.
[79:44.96]Dump more plastic in the ocean.
[79:46.72]Dump a bunch of fucking plastic in the ocean.
[79:51.36]We don't even know why we're doing this.
[79:53.39]We're a villain from the 1980s and 90s.
[79:56.95]Dump plastic in the ocean.
[79:58.21]Who fucking cares?
[79:59.33]I don't even know why I'm doing
[80:19.66]I feel like I'm missing something here.
[80:22.28]This has got ToeJam & Earl vibes.
[80:25.90]I love it.
[80:26.97]Bottom?
[80:27.81]Okay.
[80:49.53]I feel like I have to actually stop these.
[80:55.29]I'm afraid to go near them, though.
[81:01.37]It's the diamond squares.
[81:03.73]Oh, that's going to kill us.
[81:08.89]Oh.
[81:19.88]I think that's working.
[81:22.68]I don't know what it's doing, but it's... Wait, give it back, give it back, give it back, back, back, back, give that back!
[81:27.42]Okay.
[81:41.37]Digital.
[81:45.49]Digital.
[81:49.84]If you paid me a hundred million dollars right now to tell you what just happened, I wouldn't be able to do it.
[82:04.57]Okay, this one's different now.
[82:05.91]Everything's going faster.
[82:16.27]Yeah.
[82:18.35]Oh shit, hold on, pause it.
[82:43.58]You know, it's really good.
[82:44.54]It's really good that, you know, these games can still exist.
[82:52.22]I'm really happy about... Okay, I need to stop talking because I'm going to get crushed.
[82:57.61]Here's the thing.
[82:59.65]If I didn't have this disk right now...
[83:04.06]I would imagine that another 10 to 20 years from now, I bet you people would be, you would explain to them this game and they would tell you you were lying to them.
[83:13.54]Like this, this does not exist.
[83:14.98]You are a liar.
[83:18.40]No, you don't understand.
[83:19.18]It was this game.
[83:20.30]It was, um, these boxes were falling down and going left and right.
[83:25.04]And the whole point of the game was you're supposed to stop climate change and the incoming disaster of corporate greed by grabbing blocks.
[83:32.27]And you had a dog, too, and it was a dog?
[83:34.61]And, um, the dog didn't have any purpose or anything.
[83:37.33]It'd be like, bro, what the fuck are you talking about?
[83:40.77]You're making this up.
[83:41.53]It's, like, annoying when you tell, like, annoying, stupid stories like this, but there's nothing behind it.
[83:47.06]Where's the evidence?
[83:49.69]I don't understand.
[83:50.47]I have a CD.
[83:51.27]I have a 3DO.
[83:52.91]What's a 3DO?
[83:54.31]No, no.
[83:55.09]These kids don't understand.
[83:56.67]They need to learn.
[84:03.16]Okay, so it comes out of the... Like these.
[84:06.98]But what the fuck do you do?
[84:10.02]I'm going down.
[84:11.16]I got held back a grade.
[84:14.15]It put me down a level, didn't it?
[84:20.40]It just said level two!
[84:31.84]I think you need to stop them while... I don't know.
[84:41.35]I need to figure this out.
[84:43.93]You need to have another one hit the one behind it.
[84:48.82]And it needs to have a green triangle on it.
[84:51.92]I actually got demoted.
[84:53.16]I got brought down a level.
[84:55.14]You can hold the red ones.
[84:56.08]Yeah, you can hold all of them, but if you hold them for too long, I think it just crushes you.
[85:06.56]Stop the red ones in front of the diamond ones.
[85:10.62]This should be a sprint button.
[85:12.78]Whoa.
[85:16.10]Uh, how do I do that?
[85:17.00]How do I fix that?
[85:19.61]I can zoom out, but I cannot zoom in.
[85:22.03]Oh, there we go.
[85:29.88]He wants to dodge roll.
[85:30.88]I kind of do.
[85:31.48]Digital.
[85:37.98]You only need to get one.
[85:42.77]Who cares?
[85:49.89]This guy looks like you.
[85:52.49]I know, it's very loud too.
[85:54.27]How come nobody was screaming at me because it was too loud?
[86:00.26]What if I just hold this forever?
[86:07.70]Oh, you can't.
[86:08.48]It moves you automatically.
[86:14.16]What are you talking about, man?
[86:15.82]Come on.
[86:16.40]No, I don't want to get demoted.
[86:26.61]Wait, this might do it.
[86:35.29]Oh, I hear one.
[86:36.07]One dropped up there at top right.
[86:40.62]Okay, one dropped over there.
[86:43.34]Just make a huge traffic jam and then go collect.
[86:45.20]Get out of the way.
[86:54.84]Where's the exit?
[86:56.22]Down.
[87:04.85]Okay, we made it.
[87:13.41]Locked in.
[87:13.91]What do you do about this?
[87:35.56]I think I have to get this all the way up.
[87:41.36]Oh no, I'm gonna block myself in permanently.
[87:45.24]Get out of the fucking way!
[87:48.78]Get out of the way!
[87:51.52]Wait, is the exit?
[87:56.84]Oh my god, that almost hit me.
[87:59.88]Okay, now we go like this.
[88:02.95]Wait.
[88:04.13]Does it get hit?
[88:06.21]Yep.
[88:06.73]Move it.
[88:09.33]Oh, you motherfucker.
[88:10.51]Shit.
[88:12.01]Put it back.
[88:12.71]This one looks like it has mold on it.
[88:23.39]It kind of did.
[88:27.81]OK, now move it.
[88:35.11]Quickly.
[88:37.25]OK, wait, just wait, wait, wait, ready?
[88:59.80]How come it didn't drop?
[89:01.16]Oh my god.
[89:05.79]What's the point of the dog?
[89:24.81]Get it, click!
[89:26.91]Get it!
[89:28.35]Yes!
[89:29.21]Okay, I need to box everything in.
[89:45.93]Maybe the dog is an extra hit?
[89:54.26]Don't get hit by this.
[89:56.86]Your stamina is at the bottom right.
[89:59.30]How do you get stamina back?
[90:02.06]By eating this weird shit on the ground?
[90:03.51]Yuck.
[90:09.17]Um, the red ones kill you.
[90:11.59]Well, I don't know what that is.
[90:12.51]I don't know why it's on the ground.
[90:14.59]I don't know why you can eat it.
[90:16.01]But apparently those ones are poisonous.
[90:19.11]Why?
[90:19.55]Okay.
[90:21.77]Now that I know that I'm never going to touch them ever again.
[90:32.95]Poison berries.
[90:42.64]Oh shit, it's gonna crush me.
[90:47.96]I don't like this.
[90:48.45]I don't like being here.
[90:49.21]I just want to see a cutscene with the big guy with the cigar again.
[91:05.53]Okay.
[91:07.85]Stop that one.
[91:10.11]And then... If I cause a big traffic jam, then they'll all just drop.
[91:18.06]Watch this.
[91:18.44]Ready?
[91:22.32]I think I can make it.
[91:23.12]What the fuck are you talking about?
[91:32.38]What just happened?
[91:37.71]Did I?
[91:38.37]I stepped on the chair.
[91:39.61]I have to get this.
[91:43.07]I need to get this.
[91:44.05]Oh shit.
[91:45.61]Too dangerous.
[92:14.35]OK, I'm not going to.
[92:15.89]The cherry is right below me.
[92:17.23]Here's what we're doing.
[92:21.89]Don't touch that.
[92:23.99]I want to block this one off and I think I have to go get another box.
[92:27.27]Because the other box I'm going to block the second wave.
[92:32.70]Let's do this first.
[92:33.50]Hold on, give me another box.
[92:36.50]Do not rush me.
[92:42.41]Oh my god, I made it.
[92:43.75]Holy shit, I almost got crushed.
[93:01.36]Oh shit, this is bad.
[93:02.82]OK, I need to block this.
[93:05.16]I need to block this one off.
[93:16.70]I'm so scared it's going to crush me.
[93:18.72]What the fuck is going on?
[93:19.88]What's going on?
[93:20.44]Why do they move the other way?
[93:21.39]They can go the other way.
[93:24.31]That was horrifying.
[93:25.61]Okay.
[93:30.47]Now, go this way.
[93:42.00]Don't step on that.
[93:42.98]So now that's going to be blocked.
[93:46.22]Okay.
[93:46.46]Okay.
[94:14.18]Do not touch that thing.
[94:16.50]They need to be spread out by a little bit more.
[94:20.94]Or not.
[94:24.25]Okay, I need to...
[94:43.55]What is that?
[94:45.49]What is that thing?
[94:46.35]Something's coming after me.
[94:47.83]Okay, the ghost from Bubble Bobble is coming after me.
[94:50.52]I don't know what that thing is, but it scares me.
[94:57.20]Okay, now... I'm gonna... Get the fuck out of here!
[95:13.74]Two is the key.
[95:20.87]That's fast.
[95:23.87]Okay, well there's one right there.
[95:27.71]How do I get that one?
[95:36.81]And a diamond?
[95:37.61]Can I just leave?
[95:38.97]Oh no, it said I need two.
[95:42.13]Alright, easy.
[95:42.67]Watch this.
[95:49.88]Okay, I'm just gonna... Okay, now move it.
[96:16.63]Oh, okay, this is trapped here.
[96:17.89]Wait, hold on, they're gonna...
[96:34.09]Wait, what just happened?
[96:35.35]What's going on?
[96:36.03]Oh my God, I don't know, but I think it's okay.
[96:39.90]This shit needs to move.
[96:40.70]Get this thing out of the way.
[96:41.38]How do I move this?
[96:41.96]How do you move this one?
[97:03.19]Oh, shit.
[97:10.30]Oh, shit.
[97:12.48]Oh, shit.
[97:14.42]Oh.
[97:14.84]No, I want to...
[97:30.44]The dog keeps barking.
[97:31.50]Okay, are they gonna move again?
[97:42.35]Okay, I... The dog doesn't give you an extra hit, by the way.
[97:51.91]This is global warming music?
[97:56.69]What?
[97:57.05]I don't... I don't get it.
[98:04.41]The death noise is awful.
[98:10.00]That's the kind of sound you would make if you really got crushed by a big cube.
[98:19.24]I'm just waiting for the boss fight.
[98:21.29]Trust me, we are not loading up a second run.
[98:26.55]I just want to see that guy with the cigar again.
[98:36.04]Okay, now I move this.
[98:38.32]Guys, I have no idea what I'm doing.
[98:47.67]Shit!
[99:06.38]Cross, down.
[99:07.60]Cross, down.
[99:09.24]Cross, down.
[99:13.37]Cross, down.
[99:19.87]Cross, down.
[99:25.90]Cross.
[99:26.72]Okay, this one has to move up.
[99:30.52]Somebody said, I feel like you would get crushed by a cube in real life.
[99:34.98]That's probably one of the ways I could go.
[99:38.10]I can see that.
[99:42.96]In fact, it would have to probably end that way.
[99:47.96]I want to be like 95 years old and have a piano land on me.
[99:51.93]Just walk into the sidewalk.
[100:02.68]I have to stop them from moving.
[100:04.03]Okay, now it'll... I gotta... Come on, come on, come on.
[100:06.22]Move it, move, move, move, move, move, move.
[100:07.34]Go, go, go, go, go.
[100:34.81]I can't do it.
[100:36.08]It's too, I like, I don't know.
[100:38.13]I get it, but I don't, but I get it.
[101:05.77]You piece of shit.
[101:15.74]Alright, that's trapped in there now.
[101:18.66]I'm just gonna let it sit.
[101:19.28]Wait a minute, there's one that's all the way up there that... Hold on.
[101:24.90]Oh my god!
[101:31.16]Oh my god!
[101:34.98]Oh!
[101:40.08]No, no, no, no, no.
[101:41.54]I don't want to do that either.
[101:42.42]Uh-oh.
[101:45.94]Now I'm in trouble.
[101:47.08]I actually think I ruined everything.
[102:12.03]Alright, I'm going to the next one.
[102:13.47]I'm going to the next one.
[102:18.99]That was Gritters.
[102:21.45]And it was very, very interesting.
[102:23.81]I thought it was actually pretty fun.

[104:03.80]I feel like more than one of you said that.
[104:07.12]I feel like more than 100 of you said that.
[104:12.80]And I can't leave the game until I score at least 10 points.

[107:01.67]Okay.
[107:02.39]Alright, let's do one player.
[107:11.46]This music is amazing.
[107:12.92]I think I'm picking Roxy.
[107:26.26]One on one?
[107:26.92]Wait, did he say he was going to knock me out?
[107:32.75]This is like Mortal Kombat.
[107:34.19]Okay, I'm going to do this.
[107:36.39]First to 21, let's go.
[107:37.33]$100 on the line.
[107:37.79]I don't even know how to play.
[107:39.39]Fuck it, let's go.
[107:44.52]Oh, I can bet.
[107:45.24]Bet $300. $300.
[107:54.35]Yeah, you're not so tough.
[108:00.23]What the fuck?
[108:03.47]That was 360.
[108:04.68]Did you see that shit?
[108:05.72]Oh, my God.
[108:06.40]I got way too excited about that.
[108:11.40]Oh, I have to clear it.
[108:13.24]Shit.
[108:13.56]360. 360.
[108:27.99]Oh, I fell over.
[108:32.09]I cleared it.
[108:35.07]Oh, my God.
[108:36.03]Roxy is so good.
[108:43.45]Give me that shit.
[108:44.07]Give me that ball.
[108:45.91]Clear it.
[108:47.09]Dunk it.
[108:48.88]Oh.
[108:54.26]I don't even know what happened.
[108:56.72]I'm so confused.
[109:11.37]Okay, I was ahead.
[109:12.37]I was ahead.
[109:13.39]I was ahead.
[109:13.87]I gotta relax.
[109:22.80]Now he's running away with it.
[109:24.02]Shit.
[109:30.76]You gotta be kidding me.
[109:31.56]I should have blocked it.
[109:36.65]Shit.
[109:42.39]Oh my god, it's bloody.
[109:45.81]Alright, that's good.
[109:49.11]That's good.
[109:49.36]Get it back.
[109:49.62]Get it back.
[109:54.60]Got it.
[109:54.82]That would have been sick.
[110:02.18]Oh.
[110:07.25]Damn it.
[110:10.51]Oh my God, I took him out of midair.
[110:17.68]OK, this this game is actually amazing when I'm not.
[110:20.56]I'm going to be honest for awhile.
[110:28.97]Yes.
[110:33.46]Oh no, that's free.
[110:39.80]Drained it again.
[110:40.40]Roxy is one of the best three shooters in the game.
[110:50.68]What?
[110:51.04]Why did I dunk it from so far away?
[110:52.54]No way, dude.
[110:54.06]Are you kidding me?
[111:01.22]Okay, it's 11-13.
[111:03.90]I'm running it back here.
[111:14.85]Holy shit, I'm only down by one.
[111:17.37]Okay.
[111:30.53]Are there injuries in the game?
[111:31.59]Whoa, I got fouled?
[111:39.35]What are you talking about, call foul?
[111:50.20]Why can't I do that?
[111:51.26]Okay.
[111:51.74]I have one move.
[112:09.04]Got to get to 21.
[112:09.90]One three-pointer seals it.
[112:18.66]Why were you not calling a foul in the first... Best game.
[112:29.61]Yes!
[112:39.89]What are you doing?
[112:46.09]Shoot it!
[112:46.85]Oh, fuck!
[112:47.41]I have to score him right now.
[112:49.95]Yes!
[112:50.53]Okay, we're good.
[112:53.92]I put 300 bucks on that game, by the way.
[112:56.32]Get it?
[112:58.52]Okay, wait.
[113:00.26]Did I get it?
[113:01.78]What do you mean, get it?
[113:15.29]Do I get it?
[113:18.77]Oh, that's the password.
[113:20.30]Okay, so this one is too hot.
[113:24.00]Too hot.
[113:24.58]What's that mean?
[113:27.12]First to 21.
[113:27.92]Hotspot is times two.
[113:29.33]Fouls enforced.
[113:30.25]Loser is out.
[113:34.73]Okay, so I have to get shoot from the hotspots.
[113:48.03]There's a hot spot right there.
[113:51.29]Home improvement?
[113:52.87]Oh, shit!
[114:14.55]Oh, you motherfucker!
[114:15.83]He didn't even get it!
[114:16.47]He didn't even get it!
[114:22.64]Alright, that was big.
[114:28.74]No way.
[114:29.35]I can do that too.
[114:39.45]What?
[114:48.09]What is he doing?
[114:52.88]That's got to be two points, right?
[114:57.91]Reggie like a book.
[115:06.23]No!
[115:13.02]Get in there!
[115:14.82]This X doesn't make any sense.
[115:17.68]Is he doing tricks?
[115:20.33]How do you do tricks?
[115:21.27]I want to do tricks.
[115:27.18]Look at that shit.
[115:38.81]That's bullshit.
[115:41.55]Good.
[115:42.67]Two shots?
[115:45.05]That is not cool.
[115:49.49]He's pushing.
[115:50.19]Alright, this guy's way better.
[115:54.14]I can bring it back.
[115:57.60]What, Roxy?
[115:58.16]You had such a good shot before.
[115:59.62]Why can't I even shoot it now?
[116:00.86]There we go.
[116:14.05]How are you going to get that ball again?
[116:18.39]He shot that from behind the net.
[116:20.41]That doesn't make any sense.
[116:26.77]That was sick too.
[116:34.07]Come on!
[116:42.92]That almost came out of the net.
[116:47.28]Call a foul.
[116:54.58]At some point, it's an offensive foul.
[117:09.83]Where's the X?
[117:10.27]Get away from me!
[117:10.99]Get the fuck in there!
[117:39.00]How?
[117:39.60]I'm not on the same plane as the ball.
[117:49.57]Why can I not hit these shots anymore?
[117:51.23]Roxy, do you have like a stamina bar?
[118:00.09]What is going on?
[118:00.79]She didn't have the power anymore.
[118:13.05]What?
[118:14.17]How do I call a fowl?
[118:16.94]Where's fowl?
[118:28.29]Okay, so it's not a fowl when he does it to me.
[118:31.79]That's unbelievable.
[118:35.27]And he gets to float in the air like a fucking magician.
[118:48.28]Why?
[118:48.58]I can't even... I'm not high enough.
[118:50.52]I'm not tall enough.
[119:05.91]I... What are you talking about, man?
[119:11.00]Yeah, good luck.
[119:20.87]Okay, did I run into the pole or did it hit me in the head?
[119:24.94]I'm not sure.
[119:25.60]There it is.
[119:37.93]Seven to sixteen, oh my god.
[119:52.77]What are you... Okay.
[119:55.75]I don't understand.
[119:56.67]When I go try to steal the ball, I push the person over.
[120:00.11]When they go to steal the ball, they just gently take it from me.
[120:14.43]He's literally elbowing me.
[120:15.73]Where's the foul?
[120:16.27]He's elbowing me in the face.
[120:17.81]Where's the shot clock?
[120:37.03]Okay, I can bring it back here.
[120:38.07]I don't even care if I get a fall.
[120:51.32]Nice!
[120:51.96]Okay, come on.
[121:02.12]You're never gonna hit it from that far!
[121:17.48]I gotta continue here.
[121:18.48]I'm going another 300 bucks.
[121:22.58]I know this guy plays dirty.
[121:23.88]I just ran into the fucking pole again.
[121:33.15]I'm so bad at this.
[121:34.33]Okay.
[121:43.58]Ooh!
[121:44.26]That's it, I'm ahead.
[121:48.74]What kind of air ball was that?
[122:10.54]No!
[122:10.76]Fuck!
[122:11.64]My hands got sweaty!
[122:14.57]That went in?
[122:39.66]I'm just being a wicked weirdo.
[122:51.04]Yes!
[122:51.58]Okay, we're doing good.
[123:01.21]He's going for a dunk.
[123:03.49]Oh, come on.
[123:11.74]That block was horseshit.
[123:19.95]Give me a break!
[123:21.17]You don't even run back with that!
[123:22.83]That's no way!
[123:25.31]Yeah, I'm right in your face.
[123:41.39]Come on, don't do it, please.
[123:54.96]What?
[123:55.32]Okay, the game just changed audio tracks and my character froze.
[124:10.11]Give me the ball!
[124:15.29]Give me a rebound.
[124:16.43]Just one rebound.
[124:31.08]You got it.
[124:32.18]That's my bread and butter right there.
[124:41.91]I'm not tall enough to dunk.
[124:51.91]Okay, I gotta calm down.
[125:03.43]Oh, if you bet against me this time, I don't know if that's a good idea.
[125:23.52]My combo against the wall.
[125:32.61]We're laughing today.
[125:41.73]What the hell was that?
[125:46.65]Okay, you can do cool moves.
[125:49.78]I didn't know you could do cool moves.
[125:56.17]No way.
[125:57.87]Nice job.
[126:03.07]Pump it up?
[126:05.33]What did that do?
[126:24.89]I just made my shoes more slippery.
[126:28.57]Holy shit.
[126:39.30]That was awesome.
[126:40.34]And it was triple points.
[126:56.60]What happened?
[126:57.45]That was very weird.
[126:59.59]I don't know how I scored that.
[127:00.59]I threw it down.
[127:10.06]Game point right here.
[127:11.10]3, 2, 1.
[127:12.28]Boink.
[127:14.90]Hope you bet for me this time.
[127:19.61]RT with a raid I missed from... That was a while ago.
[127:25.97]Thanks, everybody.
[127:26.51]That came in from RTGame.
[127:27.63]Appreciate it.
[127:31.59]I'm still playing against this guy.
[127:34.85]I'll go 200.
[127:43.06]Best two or three?
[127:43.96]How do I call a foul?
[127:55.38]It'll be call foul instead of pump it up, okay.
[127:57.84]Come on, not a second foul.
[128:25.56]Ugh.
[128:26.42]Fuck.
[128:27.52]Okay, I am... There it is.
[128:59.98]Okay he's pissed.
[129:00.78]Nice.
[129:04.00]Really?
[129:04.96]Again I don't have any power!
[129:55.78]what come on I'm trying to catch it I can't do it
[130:24.15]I can bring it back.
[130:24.73]Ready?
[130:25.11]One, two, three.
[130:28.41]Good.
[130:36.02]That's not good.
[130:36.60]That's bad.
[130:47.49]That wasn't times two?
[130:53.62]Oh my God.
[131:06.88]How do I not get the ball?
[131:08.20]That's what I don't understand.
[131:11.09]That's what I don't understand.
[131:27.91]Pick up the ball.
[131:28.79]What are you talking about?
[131:29.75]I'm standing two feet in front of it.
[131:31.65]You saw that.
[131:37.72]I froze.
[131:41.84]Oh, that's bad.
[131:42.64]Come on.
[131:44.26]Come on.
[132:11.19]We're good.
[132:12.07]Give me a three.
[132:20.08]What are you aiming at?
[132:38.74]What a dumbass.
[132:39.72]You're not gonna get shit there, man.
[132:42.11]Get!
[132:45.25]You want some?
[133:14.22]Just stick right in him.
[133:36.11]No way.
[133:37.92]You've got to be fucking kidding me, dude.
[133:44.38]Dude, okay, somebody explain to me why I feel like the first half of the game, my shots don't have any power at all, like zero.
[133:52.19]But then, all of a sudden, they start to go all the way to the hoop.
[133:55.60]Does that make any sense?
[133:56.16]So what?
[134:00.90]Get out of here!
[134:09.17]Like, why is that not going?
[134:10.39]I've done the same shot a hundred fucking times.
[134:14.19]Why is, what is going on?
[134:31.65]I've done the same shot a hundred times.
[134:34.25]I don't understand what's going on.
[134:42.34]Oh my god, I'm getting fucking destroyed.
[134:47.20]Now all of a sudden it works.
[134:54.17]Okay, dude.
[135:01.31]Might as well do the same thing.
[135:23.76]Every time.
[135:56.91]why am I not the one picking the ball she's not putting her hands down to pick it up
[136:30.48]It just goes over my head.
[136:32.10]God damn it.
[136:36.23]This is so... The computer's too hard.
[136:38.33]If the computer... Okay.
[136:40.07]When the computer comes within one, like, meter of the ball, the computer will pick it up.
[136:45.99]I have to be... I have to... It's stupid.
[137:09.71]You're being rolled?
[137:10.56]Yeah, because the dude calls foul every foul.
[137:13.64]Oh, ow.
[137:15.38]She pushed me.
[137:16.28]I'm not going to push her back though.
[137:18.04]I'm going to push her onto the ground.
[137:19.58]Oh, ow.
[137:20.12]You hurt.
[137:20.54]You pushed me.
[137:29.71]Alright, I'm doing the dunk specialist.
[137:41.94]Who's the dunk specialist?
[137:44.78]This guy's crazy.
[137:52.45]That was the easiest points of my entire life.
[137:55.77]Let's try this guy.
[138:02.12]Alright, I'm going in.
[138:05.32]Fouls enforced.
[138:09.58]I'm going all in.
[138:10.78]I don't care if I lose all my money.
[138:17.63]Okay, that was pretty good.
[138:24.15]Okay.
[138:30.45]My back was just going...
[138:52.52]Why was I like two feet tall?
[138:55.70]Why am I walking like this?
[138:58.94]This is the new technique.
[139:00.74]He's freaking out.
[139:01.31]He doesn't know what to do.
[139:10.17]That was clean.
[139:23.31]Okay, 3-3.
[139:33.25]Shooting it like that is not smart.
[139:43.10]These jumps are not high.
[139:45.54]It's not as epic as I thought it was going to be.
[139:57.30]Those layups work.
[140:01.60]Whatever.
[140:02.86]Thought he was gonna shoot it.
[140:08.55]Yeah, pump it.
[140:28.92]That works.
[140:34.84]Fuck you.
[140:35.40]Why am I so slow?
[140:39.65]Come on.
[140:40.23]I gotta hit this right now.
[140:47.25]Yes.
[141:03.71]I need to jump higher than that.
[141:04.89]Why am I jumping so slow now?
[141:19.88]I don't understand what's going on.
[141:33.13]Get in there, shit!
[141:35.30]Okay.
[141:45.76]No way.
[141:54.39]The ball just went, why is he not putting his hands in the air?
[141:56.47]The ball went over my head.
[142:16.95]I guess I scored.
[142:18.49]Come on!
[142:19.01]I'm so mad!
[142:44.91]Oh, God.
[142:46.41]What is going on?
[142:46.87]This guy's slayed.
[142:47.61]It's just every stat is like 100.
[142:48.91]Come on, sucker.
[142:56.58]So what?
[143:02.58]Get out of here.
[143:05.19]Money.
[143:18.92]No, I thought he was gonna shoot it.
[143:20.66]I'm so pissed.
[143:25.56]Okay, I have to stop him here.
[143:40.75]I'm playing one match as that guy.
[143:42.73]I'm doing one more.
[143:46.07]I'm picking that character.
[143:49.13]Sorry, you're playing Fox.
[143:51.57]I'm playing King Dedede.
[143:58.87]I haven't played Fox yet.
[144:22.19]Everybody knows when you play King Dedede, you just do the up jump move and jump off the cliff.
[144:28.38]Wow, that best character in the whole game.
[144:32.52]Jam and slam!
[144:56.31]I'm gonna scream at this game.
[144:59.11]I didn't even mean it.
[145:03.00]What just happened?
[145:04.98]He's throwing it behind.
[145:06.28]I'm fucking quitting.
[145:07.72]I'm out of here.
[145:13.12]He's throwing shit behind his back and still scoring.
[145:17.68]Get out of here with this.
[145:23.28]Why would he pick up the ball?
[145:34.38]What?
[145:36.22]Holy shit, dude.
[145:37.18]Come on.
[145:41.47]Alright, I'm back in the game.
[145:51.27]He always seems to be in front of me.
[145:54.38]And he got, what is going on?
[145:56.16]How do you even get the ball?
[146:04.63]How do you even pick the ball up there?
[146:11.52]Not over.
[146:17.82]Pick up the ball.
[146:18.84]What is happening?
[146:19.96]You can watch it happen in real time.
[146:21.28]He just walks like an idle animation.
[146:29.97]And then I, I, it's a foul on me.
[146:32.29]It's a foul on me.
[146:34.81]Look what I did.
[146:47.72]Well, you did push him down and kick him.
[147:00.16]The ball just went right through my character.
[147:04.86]Big deal.
[147:09.08]Big deal.
[147:44.09]Why can't I do that shit to him?
[147:46.17]Oh!
[147:46.63]Oh!
[148:16.20]I thought that was... What is happening with this game?
[148:40.97]Look, I'm in slow motion when I go get the ball.
[148:43.05]He does not have to deal with slow motion video games.
[148:55.33]And he gets the rebound and my guy is a PNG What the fuck
[149:25.42]Why is my shit so off?
[149:27.42]That's so stupid.
[149:31.72]Okay.
[149:34.19]Whenever I do that, I push him down and get a foul.
[149:39.73]He just like sneaks it out of my hands.
[149:46.36]How come when he does it, he just like strips the ball?
[149:48.76]When I do it, their head hits like the cement and I get a fucking foul.
[150:04.11]One more try.
[150:06.37]Going back to Roxy.
[150:09.69]I'm not messing around anymore.
[150:12.03]Not screwing around.
[150:27.10]Yeah, you're not so tough.
[150:36.51]I would bet on this one.
[150:59.82]Okay, this game is fucked up.
[151:02.44]There's just no way.
[151:06.42]There's just like absolutely no fucking way that that happens.
[151:09.88]It's just not possible.
[151:31.50]I thought he was going for a three-pointer.
[151:51.64]Why am I not picking the fucking ball off?!
[151:55.98]That's insane!
[152:10.30]I'm definitely winning this one.
[152:26.25]There's no way he's coming back.
[152:44.82]Oh fuck.
[152:46.18]Come on!
[153:16.31]Whoops!
[153:19.75]Yeah, you're not so tough!
[153:22.01]Roger!
[153:32.66]What the fuck are you talking about?
[153:34.68]What are you talking about?
[153:46.36]How do you still get the ball?
[154:16.05]Alright, I need two points and I'm good.
[154:54.57]It's okay.
[154:54.99]I'm sorry.
[154:55.35]I just have to get this one shot.
[154:56.60]Ready?
[154:56.80]I just have to get it in.
[155:01.42]Game over.
[155:01.78]I win.
[155:02.60]Nice.
[155:03.20]Okay.
[155:03.50]We keep going.
[155:11.76]Okay.
[155:16.46]Now it's this one.
[155:19.06]I'm not going to care about the hotspots.
[155:21.85]Hotspots are useless.
[155:23.79]They put them across the whole entire game.
[155:25.55]It makes it incredibly difficult.
[155:28.49]We're going in first try.
[155:36.59]That's a good start.
[155:43.74]I just ran into the fucking pole.
[155:57.27]It keeps doing these goofy shots and then I don't get the ball!
[156:01.17]It bounces over my head!
[156:02.39]Dude, pick up the ball!
[156:07.38]The ball bounces too high and I can't get it!
[156:09.72]Get out of my way.
[156:41.19]That ball teleported across my character's body.
[156:45.37]And I still yet don't have it.
[156:47.11]Pick up the fucking ball!
[157:20.41]Look at how Boise's so much faster than me!
[157:22.11]Do you see that?
[157:22.77]That was ridiculous!
[157:23.58]My character's in slow motion!
[157:24.84]Give it up, baby!
[157:31.82]My character moves so slow!
[157:44.93]No way, man!
[157:55.71]Pump it!
[157:56.19]We're all balanced, fool!
[158:01.75]So what?
[158:03.15]Get outta here!
[158:27.80]Get away from me!
[158:30.40]Hi, game.
[158:49.57]You've got... You can't be serious.
[158:51.07]The game is... I don't have to say anything.
[158:56.72]It's insane what's happening right now.
[159:01.12]I still don't pick the ball up.
[159:02.92]And he gets a foul.
[159:03.76]Oh boo hoo, you get to do it.
[159:06.26]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[159:18.91]He moves faster.
[159:19.85]He has a gigantic ball rebound hitbox.
[159:24.87]And then he never ever pushes me down.
[159:27.02]He just like gently like strips the ball.
[159:29.96]I can't do that.
[159:51.99]Dude, the game takes, whenever I push him down, I have to, the game lags.
[159:57.32]And it has to process me running.
[159:59.85]Yet he still, he's already queued up running.
[160:26.74]That's not fair!
[160:28.39]Why can I not call him out on that?
[160:30.95]But he can do it to me.
[160:53.63]Get in there.
[160:54.47]Alright, I'm winning.
[160:55.27]Hey, my dad works at Panasonic.
[160:59.42]I'll ask him to get right on that.
[161:01.08]Oh, I think this is a win though.
[161:15.05]That was a terrible shot.
[161:27.38]Yeah, and ask him when Gex 2 is going to come out.
[161:34.05]I kind of want to know.
[161:43.32]Ooh, one point.
[161:45.10]Let's go.
[161:56.64]Let's get the rebound.
[161:57.42]It's a miss.
[162:02.62]Alright, I just did it.
[162:14.33]Cleaned him out.
[162:15.36]He bet everything.
[162:18.70]Alright, we've never been this far.
[162:22.74]Poison.
[162:23.30]How does poison work?
[162:29.17]20 points equals poison.
[162:30.69]Score becomes 10.
[162:31.65]Wait, what?
[162:39.12]I don't get it.
[162:39.70]Score becomes 10?
[162:40.68]I guess we'll have to find out.
[162:51.31]You can't score 20.
[162:52.17]Oh, shit.
[163:04.50]That was the Baldi's basic sound.
[163:08.10]Guys.
[163:09.52]R, L and R are steel.
[163:29.78]I have not pressed them really once the whole game.
[163:53.59]Oh, get this shit out of here.
[163:55.55]Come on.
[164:17.89]Um, apparently I didn't shoot that.
[164:54.15]Oh my God!
[165:01.29]What is happening in this game?
[165:02.95]My throat hurts now.
[165:14.70]I thought I ran into the pole.
[165:20.84]I was convinced I...
[165:26.73]I think I did his fault.
[165:29.78]The game doesn't care anymore.
[165:59.05]I needed that so bad Do I just score points for him?
[166:39.45]No!
[166:39.95]I need a three right here.
[166:41.57]Shit.
[167:08.75]I don't... No way!
[167:37.00]What the fuck is the... I... I... What?
[167:43.97]There's no explanation for why I didn't get that ball.
[167:47.09]That keeps happening over and over again.
[168:13.76]Come on!
[168:14.44]You're supposed to be the shot queen!
[168:16.02]Oh my god!
[168:43.44]Oh, very fifth time will be a charm.
[169:00.91]Somehow, not... I didn't score somehow.
[169:08.23]My story...
[169:17.19]Oh, it's over.
[169:18.02]It's over.
[169:18.50]I'm going to lose right here.
[169:19.62]I don't... Why am I not picking up the ball?
[169:51.28]Is there a gas leak out here?
[169:52.67]Why can we both not do anything?
[169:54.11]I don't understand.
[170:04.73]I don't get it.
[170:06.88]I don't understand why that just happened.
[170:11.74]I'm going all in.
[170:12.68]600 bucks.
[170:26.84]Yeah, waste of pump.
[170:46.29]He pumped it up and didn't do anything.
[170:55.51]I went all in on this one.
[170:59.45]I have to win.
[171:01.03]I... I'm gonna...
[171:26.05]Oh, good.
[171:30.56]Answered immediately.
[171:31.48]Fine.
[171:58.12]There we go.
[171:58.58]I had to make that.
[172:00.38]But that was probably GG.
[172:01.08]Could have been game over.
[172:06.29]That was disgustingly ugly, but it worked.
[172:19.10]Okay, so I don't want to get to 20 points.
[172:33.13]No, don't I need to clean!
[173:20.80]That was a must hit scenario and I didn't do it.
[173:38.15]Oh, come on, please.
[173:46.04]That was my plan the whole time.
[173:51.75]Alright, don't get to 20.
[173:58.33]I need to get a 3.
[174:02.85]Game.
[174:07.01]Shit.
[174:16.53]I can never grab the bomb.
[174:38.90]Yes!
[174:39.60]That's game.
[174:42.78]That was $600 bet, by the way.
[174:46.30]He went all-in at $600.
[174:47.90]We both went all-in.
[174:54.34]Frenzy.
[174:59.54]Two-ball free-for-all.
[175:01.16]Score from X only.
[175:02.48]There are no fouls.
[175:07.25]So it's just a complete free-for-all.
[175:08.59]There's no way I'd lose this.
[175:09.65]I would not.
[175:10.97]I'd be surprised.
[175:46.34]How do we not have any points?
[175:47.72]Give me that.
[175:49.24]Oh, you're in trouble.
[176:27.35]Damn it!
[176:30.31]Pick a ball up, please!
[176:49.10]That didn't go in.
[177:06.43]I think you really like this game.
[177:07.59]I do.
[177:08.23]It's fun.
[177:09.47]It's really fun.
[177:15.00]This is the last one, though.
[177:15.80]Whatever.
[177:16.34]However I lose here, I lose.
[177:19.18]Into it.
[177:23.30]This game definitely ended a friendship.
[177:28.00]OK, so.
[177:30.80]You can only score from the X's and there are fouls, so you just have to be good.
[177:33.94]OK.
[177:39.70]What?
[177:40.08]How are you gonna do this?
[177:44.54]Does that count?
[177:56.11]How's that not dead?
[178:01.49]Come on how's that not in?
[178:12.11]Wow.
[178:15.30]It's winner ball too.
[178:16.74]It's winner's ball.
[178:17.70]That's a big deal.
[178:19.04]Boom.
[178:51.15]Get out of the way.
[178:52.44]No, that's my shot.
[179:21.86]This dog shit.
[179:34.01]What are you talking about, man?
[179:39.71]Pick up the ball.
[179:40.79]It's right in the plane.
[179:41.95]It just bounces over you every time.
[179:43.85]This is ridiculous.
[180:02.47]There's no way.
[180:14.33]Come on.
[180:22.97]Where's the farming sim game?
[180:24.53]I know, I got really into this one.
[180:30.81]This is going to take forever.
[180:31.77]I kind of want to lose.
[181:08.60]What?
[181:13.42]Alright.
[181:18.40]This one was fun, but I'm getting too pumped up.
[181:21.82]We're going to move on to the next one.
[181:26.41]The next one is this Japanese magazine.
[181:33.23]I don't think I'm going to win.
[181:42.11]Watch the flashbang.
[181:46.71]Okay.
[181:47.87]Let's see how this one is.
[181:55.26]You're a quitter?
[181:56.86]Yeah.
[181:58.58]I started the games in slow motion.
[182:00.86]I want to move on.
[182:04.65]That one was very good, though.
[182:06.98]I played that one for almost an hour and a half.
[182:08.78]Or like an hour or two.
[182:10.96]That was a long one.
[182:11.50]That was a good one.
[182:11.93]I like that.
[182:13.37]Okay, here we go.
[182:15.11]This one's called Live 3DO Magazine.
[182:20.07]And this is apparently CD-ROM number 10 in the series.
[182:29.51]Maybe we'll learn something today.
[182:34.80]Coming back.
[182:44.69]I already like it.
[182:52.42]Is this a 3DO Zirkoff magazine?
[182:54.66]I don't think that's what this is.
[182:55.92]Alright, this is the kind of character that is going to scream at you to eat the cereal that he's the mascot of.
[183:18.51]Live 3D.
[183:19.93]Ooh, we both had the same idea.
[183:22.35]Ooh.
[183:31.40]Oh, I just want to say, I'm crazy for crunchy crunches.
[183:53.13]Let's do the robot first.
[183:55.59]Blue pencil.
[183:59.20]Database.
[184:02.16]Database?
[184:03.10]Anyone know what that says?
[184:14.75]Where did you get this?
[184:15.47]I don't know.
[184:17.81]Now loading the database?
[184:38.42]How about Aqua World?
[184:42.02]On Aqua World, it's... Alone in the Dark.
[184:47.34]Wait, is this just a catalog of all the games that are coming to 3DO soon?
[184:51.74]It must be.
[184:58.22]This is probably a... Hey, we've played that.
[185:00.78]No, we haven't.
[185:07.54]Oh...
[185:10.33]Look at all this stuff.
[185:12.47]Okay, that's cool.
[185:16.92]What does this thing, what does this mean?
[185:18.64]3,000 something?
[185:18.96]3,000, 5,000?
[185:19.78]I don't know how to go back.
[185:39.40]Okay, so that's a database.
[185:51.29]So what's this one?
[185:52.47]Movie.
[185:53.71]Okay, we're watching a movie.
[185:56.45]You know we're going to click on the movie one.
[186:01.05]Okay.
[186:01.39]Alright, what is it?
[186:30.77]I wonder if these are ads.
[186:33.41]Warp presents.
[186:39.80]This kind of stuff would go so hard nowadays.
[186:43.48]Imagine getting like a disk in the mail.
[186:50.90]And it had two or three short films on it.
[186:54.76]A couple of fun games.
[186:56.84]Some indie games and whatever.
[186:58.24]E-books?
[187:02.21]Who cares?
[187:02.65]I think it crashed.
[187:13.69]Oh, is that the whole movie?
[187:16.32]That was the whole movie.
[187:19.90]They were really going somewhere with that.
[187:23.66]Hold on.
[187:24.06]Let's check it out one more time.
[187:34.88]I didn't touch it.
[187:35.58]It just stopped.
[187:37.04]What does it say?
[187:38.06]Where the fuck did you get this disk?
[187:48.98]I like collecting things.
[187:51.92]If I see it pop up somewhere, there's, you know, at, uh, like game stores and online and there's plenty of places to get stuff like this.
[188:04.41]I got this years ago, by the way, a long time ago, at least three or four years ago.
[188:09.17]Okay.
[188:21.12]That's actually the whole movie.
[188:23.54]That's the entire movie.
[188:29.44]No, it can't be the whole movie.
[188:45.73]It is.
[188:48.48]Here in Transylvania, one man finds himself at odds with the world.
[188:55.05]And he... That was what we got.
[188:59.03]Has the disk scratched it?
[189:00.61]Wait a minute.
[189:21.58]Whoa.
[189:26.76]Please tell me we get to watch it.
[189:29.54]Tokyo Egg Stadium.
[189:37.63]Is this an ad for a game?
[189:38.67]Because if it's an ad for a game, I have to get it.
[189:54.19]royal pro wrestling alright well I don't have that one
[190:14.64]Peace reigns throughout our galaxy.
[190:16.34]This one's in English.
[190:18.22]Tyrone Corporation announces savage defense cuts.
[190:21.70]Senior executives of the Tyrone Weapons Division are in emergency session at the Tyrone HQ.
[190:28.87]Tyrone HQ 2204.
[191:01.21]Oh, look.
[191:03.03]Watch the situation.
[191:04.65]It's now definite.
[191:06.36]The MRP defense budget is going to be wiped out as of midnight on December 31st.
[191:11.10]What are the options?
[191:12.06]We don't have any.
[191:13.82]All existing manned stations have to be automated within 60 days.
[191:17.40]Tough schedule.
[191:19.12]Who's handling it?
[191:20.44]Commander Shelford Pitts, grade six cybernere from our cybernetics division.
[191:24.75]Okay, I thought it was grade six, like he was a nine-year-old.
[191:30.01]He keeps himself to himself.
[191:32.45]Under the circumstances, I think he'd be ideal.
[191:35.45]Good.
[191:36.95]Are we still proceeding as planned for MRP 6F?
[191:40.65]Yes.
[191:41.92]Everything is in place.
[191:43.16]Gentlemen, this is the most critical moment in our company's history.
[191:49.23]I sincerely hope this plan works.
[192:03.08]Wait, two months later, we don't get to... Okay, I'll say a couple things on this.
[192:08.00]I actually am not upset about the trailers being like this because this is back when a trailer just kind of showed you something small or like gave you a little bit of, hey, look, this is the movie and this is like a couple minutes of a trailer and we're not going to show you very much.
[192:22.09]Trailers nowadays, they do this thing where they quickly do a 10 second, here's the entire trailer and...
[192:40.74]If only there was some way to stop that monster!
[192:44.18]They'll show the monster, they'll reveal the monster.
[192:46.22]They'll show the main characters stopping the monster.
[192:52.00]Then they'll show the main characters, somebody getting really hurt by the monster.
[192:57.93]Then they'll show them stopping the monster again.
[193:01.09]And then they show effectively the end of the movie.
[193:04.31]It's been so annoying.
[193:06.35]You can't watch a trailer anymore.
[193:07.76]A trailer just actually shows you a first TikTok reel of the whole movie.
[193:12.46]And then they just explain the whole movie in three minutes, two minutes.
[193:16.54]I want to go back to when trailers were... I don't want to know what the hell's going on.
[193:23.78]I want Luke Skywalker to appear in that trailer, and he's not even in the movie.
[193:28.34]Go back to just fucking with us.
[193:31.44]I don't want to see the four deaths in the horror movie before I see the horror movie.
[193:39.75]You just cut out the part when the axe goes into the person's head.
[193:43.53]You leave in the four frames before it.
[193:48.18]Go back to having a trailer open up at a swamp.
[193:52.01]And this bubbling swamp.
[193:53.59]It's just acid coming out.
[193:56.48]A bubble pops.
[193:58.22]And there's mist in the air.
[194:01.30]And then it cuts to like a stockbroker's office.
[194:04.68]Why did we see that swamp?
[194:05.86]What was the swamp for?
[194:06.58]And then it turns out like the phone hangs up.
[194:11.73]And it's just like... And he picks it up.
[194:36.53]I'm sorry, I was, I read somebody said, somebody said, I put on blindfolds and headphones to avoid trailers at the movie, and I'm just imagining somebody doing that up with my brain.
[194:50.77]I'm just imagining, just don't go in, just don't go in until the trailers are over.
[194:55.13]Why would you sit in the seat and then put a blindfold on and put headphones on?
[194:58.21]Just wait five minutes, go get popcorn or something.
[195:03.26]No, I'm sorry, I can't see this shit.
[195:11.07]I don't want to know what the movie is.
[195:13.37]I don't care if I... Oh, what if you go to the movie and it sucks?
[195:16.01]Good.
[195:17.57]Bring back shitty movies that are shitty on... Who cares?
[195:21.13]I want the director to not give a shit.
[195:22.85]I want him to just smoke 10 packs of cigarettes and not even know who's cast in the movie.
[195:31.65]I want four hundred one million dollar movies, not one four hundred million dollar movie where you show me the whole goddamn thing in the trailer and I already know how it ends, and I already know how it begins, because it's an adaptation of something I've already seen.
[195:46.12]Anyways.
[196:02.31]How do I get out of this menu?
[196:04.15]I go to the theater and put on headphones and a blindfold.
[196:09.12]Ugh.
[196:13.66]What's this one?
[196:15.42]Ooh, this one's games.
[196:21.86]They already did that.
[196:22.56]It's called Megalopolis.
[196:29.91]Yeah, that movie gets panned by critics.
[196:36.30]I took... Me... Me and my girlfriend went out to see a movie and we thought it was gonna be a swamp movie but it turns out it was just a boring office drama.
[196:44.81]And the trailer showed a bubbling swamp with a monster in the swamp.
[196:48.57]That just never was in the movie.
[196:50.45]That's just the equivalent of the mobile ads that show you the guy leveling up at level 5 to level 10.
[196:56.18]And then you get to level 30 and you fight the giant mermaid lady at the end.
[197:01.76]For some reason.
[197:02.38]And then you download that game and it's just a city builder.
[197:07.09]I mean, that's already happening now.
[197:08.61]Oh, no.
[197:10.93]What was wrong with that one?
[197:38.45]Okay, the first one didn't work.
[197:39.43]This one does.
[197:41.68]And then the phone hangs up.
[197:44.28]What the fuck am I talking about?
[197:45.60]Whoa!
[197:51.62]What's this one called?
[197:52.44]Okay.
[198:07.74]Oh, I know this game.
[198:10.96]Everybody votes on your outfit.
[198:12.44]It's in Roblox.
[198:13.30]This is where they got it from.
[198:14.55]Dressed to impress, yeah.
[198:38.63]Alright, whoever, can anyone tell us what's going on?
[198:46.47]I love how someone just said no.
[198:56.17]They're introducing themselves.
[199:11.59]How many characters are there?
[199:18.78]It's an audition for something.
[199:23.80]Spokespersons or something?
[199:25.38]Okay.
[199:26.46]Okay, now we're going three at a time.
[199:42.61]Alright.
[199:47.03]Oh shit.
[199:47.25]Rejected.
[200:05.24]I'm sorry, the birthday didn't line up with the expiration date on the passport.
[200:09.88]Ah, no.
[200:10.18]We're not going to happen.
[200:11.63]Are we just going to go through them all and stamp them all?
[200:35.92]Denied!
[200:37.20]What's that?
[201:11.76]OK.
[201:13.20]I don't know.
[201:13.83]We're just going to do that.
[201:16.05]That's not enter.
[201:18.87]What's enter?
[201:19.45]Got it.
[201:32.73]Wait, okay.
[201:34.69]I gotta fucking speak today.
[201:38.21]It's an RPG?
[201:41.38]HP?
[201:42.48]MP?
[201:43.36]I don't understand what's going on.
[201:46.08]What do I do?
[201:53.72]Okay, I'm gonna equip this person with the dagger.
[201:56.06]This person's gonna have the Cure spell.
[202:00.98]And this person's gonna have... Okay, make sure you get the glove.
[202:09.68]And we're good.
[202:11.62]And we're good.
[202:12.86]And we're good.
[202:14.06]And we're good.
[202:15.38]And we're good.
[202:17.02]And we're good.
[202:18.66]And we're good.
[202:20.24]And we're good.
[202:26.49]How do I get out of here?
[202:28.09]Oh.
[202:31.89]What happened?
[202:43.46]Is it weird that I could just sit here and watch?
[202:46.39]And play.
[202:49.57]Trailers and just I would be happy.
[202:51.41]I'm just having fun right now.
[203:02.83]Interplay deserved intros like this back in the day.
[203:06.93]Probably the single most imaginative game development houses in the world.
[203:12.63]The reason why games are so interesting nowadays, why anybody thinks anything is remotely cool is because these guys did it first.
[203:21.55]All the weird shit, all the cool, goofy, weirdo stuff came from Interplay.
[203:34.26]Somebody said, are you high?
[203:35.68]Are you?
[203:40.38]I have this game, by the way.
[203:41.84]It's right in front of me.
[203:43.42]If the trailer is good enough, I can put it in right now.
[203:59.70]The one I have is in English.
[204:11.95]Oh shit Oh
[204:45.41]I did it.
[204:45.71]Why are the controls inverted?
[204:55.54]Okay.
[205:00.82]I have this game and we're going to, that was a demo threw us right in the middle.
[205:04.56]We don't know what is even going on.
[205:08.84]I already played this one.
[205:09.88]We can skip it.
[205:12.69]6600 yen.
[205:13.17]How much is that?
[205:14.57]Okay.
[205:44.88]That rocket just got away, you blockhead!
[205:47.76]We can't afford many more screw-ups like that!
[205:53.85]That's the end of the demo.
[206:00.91]Did I get out?
[206:03.33]I, by the way, I think I played this one two years ago.
[206:10.52]That really was a mobile ad.
[206:12.22]That really was a mobile ad.
[206:13.92]The only thing that's missing is the... It needs to freeze.
[206:16.61]Somebody fuck with that.
[206:17.53]Somebody make it happen.
[206:18.73]It needs to freeze and a hose, a shovel, and a fire hydrant has to appear at the bottom of the screen.
[206:28.49]The person has to click on the fire hydrant and drag it up and then a big red X is going to go over the fire hydrant and then that's when I get hurt.
[206:42.45]Ooh, okay.
[206:44.04]It's a car game.
[206:44.70]We love these.
[206:47.18]We love these over here, don't we?
[206:52.43]I think I have this one too.
[207:31.15]I have not pressed the D-pad.
[207:33.13]Alright, let's win.
[208:08.65]Is the car going to blow up?
[208:09.51]I don't think it's going to blow up.
[208:35.52]Trying to drive the other way.
[208:47.05]Yeah, I'm trying to make it blow up and it's not working.
[208:49.09]Come on, what kind of car game is this?
[208:57.35]Everybody knows in every car game, it doesn't matter if you bump into the wall a million times or if you do too much damage to the car, it explodes.
[209:22.03]grand turismo says no wait you can't like just drive into a wall for a full 30 seconds and the smoke doesn't turn into gray smoke and then black smoke and then
[209:46.14]Okay, well that's good.
[209:48.31]So what's next?
[209:49.23]What's the first thing?
[209:51.45]This is cute.
[209:51.91]I really do miss this kind of stuff.
[210:00.17]Photo CD.
[210:08.42]I'm just making sure that... I don't know.
[210:10.88]I got this disk like fifth hand.
[210:14.36]I don't know what's on here.
[210:17.16]Somebody's fucking ball sack could be on here.
[210:19.60]I don't know.
[210:20.60]I don't know if that's even possible.
[210:22.32]I don't understand how this works.
[210:25.58]Can't do it anyways.
[210:30.92]I guess there's no data on it.
[210:35.14]Cannot select it.
[210:39.85]Interview and report.
[210:42.81]I can't do this one either.
[210:48.00]Oh, no.
[210:49.90]Why can't I do this one?
[210:50.74]I want to see the interview.
[210:57.11]Well, that was that one.
[210:57.73]Okay.
[210:59.25]Alright, I'm going to give you a choice.
[211:03.83]I may have played this one before.
[211:05.53]I don't remember.
[211:06.97]If I have, then whatever.
[211:08.17]It's okay.
[211:10.41]Seal of the Pharaoh.
[211:11.61]The one that I absolutely have played before.
[211:17.82]Who shot Johnny Rock?
[211:20.48]Played it almost 10 years ago.
[211:23.08]Which one?
[211:24.40]Seal of the Pharaoh or Who Shot Johnny Rock?
[211:49.44]Can you just play a normal game like COD or something?
[212:11.72]It's just gonna shock you.
[212:14.01]But I don't like Call of Duty.
[212:17.12]I know that's going to be the most outrageous thing you've heard all day, probably.
[212:28.06]I don't hate Call of Duty.
[212:29.66]I don't really like it, though.
[212:33.09]I don't really play it.
[212:36.23]I don't have a problem with Call of Duty.
[212:37.67]I just don't enjoy it myself.
[212:47.26]Okay, Seal of the Pharaoh.
[212:51.02]If you like Call of Duty, I'm not going to say, how could you?
[212:54.16]Are you stupid?
[212:55.84]I'm smarter than you.
[212:56.99]I like Seal of the Pharaoh on 3DO.
[213:00.03]Hey, have you even heard of, have you heard of Seal of the Pharaoh on 3DO?
[213:04.39]No, you haven't.
[213:05.19]I have.
[213:07.63]And look at how much better it is.
[213:27.21]I'm already very interested.
[213:36.55]The Pharaoh calls me.
[213:38.57]In the pyramid, all mysteries will be solved.
[213:43.63]Let us tell the astonishing story carved on a lithograph unearthed from an ancient pyramid.
[213:49.21]The pyramid appeared suddenly from the ground, turning the land around it to desert and freeing evil spirits.
[213:55.49]Long ago, your father, wishing to solve its mystery, forced his way into the pyramid alone and never returned.
[214:01.65]You must fight the evil spirits to find him.
[214:03.70]What do you mean fight the evil spirits?
[214:07.60]The evil spirits?
[214:09.96]I don't know.
[214:10.32]I feel like this is not accurate.
[214:16.39]I don't think this is accurate.
[214:25.68]I think I have played this.
[214:27.64]Maybe not.
[214:28.24]I don't know.
[214:28.54]I've played so much weird shit.
[214:29.82]I think we're just getting right into it.
[214:39.31]We're just going.
[214:48.96]Is the music coming from further in?
[214:58.56]What does this do?
[215:07.77]I don't know how this is going to help me, but maybe it will.
[215:09.75]Alright, we got evil spirits to kill.
[215:15.01]I'm going.
[215:23.48]It's... Do I... I think I just slapped it.
[215:35.79]Okay, I just threw something at it.
[215:36.83]Is this a guitar pick?
[215:52.39]Okay, left or right?
[216:02.74]Alright, first door.
[216:04.32]Oh boy.
[216:04.70]A scroll.
[216:10.12]What's it say?
[216:13.44]We'll pick it up.
[216:17.32]Did I drink it?
[216:28.32]Oh, fight, fight, fight, fight.
[216:33.02]Didn't even get the intro music.
[216:35.28]Oh my God.
[216:41.53]Did you just drink the scroll?
[216:42.87]I don't know.
[216:43.39]Did I?
[216:53.63]Oh, music back.
[217:08.72]What are these supposed to be in ancient Egypt?
[217:13.70]What's the ancient Egyptian lore on that?
[217:18.93]Yeah, somebody just said, I think cod might be a little bit better than this.
[217:22.05]Yeah, you might be right.
[217:24.17]You might be onto something there.
[217:26.29]Cod might be a little bit better than this.
[217:29.37]That's true.
[217:49.31]Okay, I can see defeat.
[217:50.85]Yeah, COD is way better than this.
[217:55.13]I hate to say it, but I think Call of Duty might be better than this game.
[218:09.83]Am I going to die eventually?
[218:11.22]Where do you get health?
[218:19.72]Oh, the music.
[218:25.74]I've never been to the pyramids.
[218:29.44]But I can imagine... You can't just... You don't just walk around in hallways like this, right?
[218:48.94]How do I kill this thing?
[218:59.46]Oh shit, look out!
[219:10.81]Is this a bat or am I throwing a scroll at it?
[219:27.47]Toughest enemy in the game so far.
[219:35.94]I didn't even kill it.
[219:37.94]That was the most anticlimactic thing in the world.
[219:50.61]Yeah, where is my health bar?
[219:51.57]I don't think I even have one.
[220:03.63]Alright door.
[220:11.94]Listen to what I have to say.
[220:13.70]OK, OK, alright.
[220:21.90]Well talk to me.
[220:22.68]What do you have to say?
[220:30.49]I am with you.
[220:31.29]I will open the door.
[220:34.93]Thank you.
[220:35.65]I appreciate it.
[220:40.13]What door?
[220:40.71]What door?
[220:47.23]There is no door.
[220:48.19]You didn't open anything.
[220:56.26]Ooh, potion.
[221:07.61]Where's the door?
[221:08.43]This is kind of awesome in a sucks ass kind of way.
[221:15.13]That's why I'm not, I haven't given up on it yet.
[221:20.17]I feel like there's a little bit more to see, but what door?
[221:23.91]There's another door.
[221:36.87]We just need to find another non playable character to talk to.
[222:06.44]When do the math questions show up?
[222:07.88]This does feel like a math questions game.
[222:12.09]Adventurer, we've been waiting for someone to solve the puzzle of the Great Pharaoh.
[222:19.17]Only you can do it.
[222:22.58]What is seven plus eight?
[222:30.10]You did it!
[222:31.96]Unbelievable, but the next question is even harder.
[222:37.02]The scholars of the world couldn't even figure this one out.
[222:40.78]Adventurer, do your best and use a sheet of paper if it helps.
[222:47.46]What is 15 divided by 17?
[223:06.60]too hard oh that's not the right answer adventurer but I will only allow you to fail this question one more time and the cave behind you will cave in if you get it wrong and then you get it wrong
[223:29.93]Oh adventurer, I could only allow you to fail this question one more time before the cave behind you will cave in and you'll be trapped here forever.
[223:42.37]Use a sheet of paper and get a parent if you think you could use some extra help.
[223:49.43]And that just, that line repeats forever.
[224:01.09]Is this the door?
[224:01.67]How do I get out of here?
[224:48.90]Whoa.
[225:14.20]Kind of reminds me of one of those old games.
[225:15.64]I feel like Mario would show up.
[225:16.68]This is one of those Mario games.
[225:19.04]Mario's in the title screen.
[225:21.70]And he's the tutorial voice.
[225:24.49]It's like Mario and the Great Pyramid.
[225:27.35]They made the five of these or six of these back in like the late 80s, right?
[225:30.91]Like the mid 90s.
[225:43.75]I picked it up this time.
[225:48.99]What even is the gameplay of Mario's Time Machine?
[225:51.31]I've never played it.
[225:54.32]It always had this aura of I don't want to play it, even when it came out when I was younger.
[225:57.96]That was a new game when I was younger.
[225:59.98]I was like 10, 12.
[226:03.46]I saw it on the shelf and it emanated an aura that I did not like.
[226:08.67]And it was Mario.
[226:09.77]Everybody who didn't want to play is Mario.
[226:15.12]Mario is missing.
[226:15.92]Yep.
[226:16.36]They just had this... Something was about them that I just... Were they even available in the United States?
[226:26.91]No, they were.
[226:34.09]Or was I just a stupid kid?
[226:37.50]And I looked at the back of the box and it said the word... I can't even say it out loud.
[226:42.52]L-E-A-R-N-I-N-G.
[226:47.51]And I said, that's not jumping on people's heads.
[226:50.67]Next.
[226:54.49]Here's a save point.
[227:37.34]It's charming, it is.
[227:38.40]Alright, we're going to play Who Shot Johnny Rock in exactly five minutes.
[227:53.18]Wait.
[227:54.64]I think I died.
[228:05.80]I just did that on my own.
[228:10.29]Nobody put me in there.
[228:11.43]I just walked into it.
[228:14.67]I had every opportunity to not do that.
[228:20.25]Why would I go in there?
[228:24.59]Good thing you saved.
[228:26.05]Okay.
[228:41.85]This one was so cute.
[228:44.69]But now let's play Who Shot Johnny Rock.
[228:46.17]I definitely played this before.
[228:48.25]But we're going to check it out again.
[228:50.07]It's been a long time.
[228:51.37]And I remember it being crazy.
[228:52.37]Hey.
[229:00.56]Just like all the Souls games.
[229:04.28]When you don't play a Souls game for, let's call it three to five years, when you play it again, it's like you never played it before in the first place.
[229:24.48]This is by American Laser Games.
[229:28.52]I have a few more that are in this category.
[229:32.13]It's the same company that made Mad Dog McCree.
[229:35.51]For those of you that remember that one, that was amazing.
[229:38.51]I think I might even just go back to some of those because like I said in the beginning of the stream, it's crazy that I played them and I streamed them and there's so many of you here right now that just never even saw it.
[229:54.38]That's crazy.
[229:54.83]It's like, whoa, wait a minute.
[229:56.43]I get to Dark Souls you guys
[230:02.40]Have I been doing this for so long that I can just go do things I've already done and it's new to so many of you that I can just go redo every stream I've ever done?
[230:10.72]And every video I've ever made, I can just go back and do it?
[230:21.39]I have prestiged as a content creator.
[230:26.69]Interesting.
[230:32.86]Alright, who shot Johnny Rock?
[230:53.57]I love this little thing.
[230:54.59]It's so cool.
[231:06.31]This one is very crusty on my screen.
[231:13.95]I don't know how... Okay, I thought it was just throwing us right into it.
[231:24.17]They made Mad Dog McCree.
[231:25.27]They made Drug... Crime Patrol?
[231:31.70]My cursor's so slow.
[231:35.46]This is so slow.
[231:37.44]I'm gonna fail everything.
[231:38.78]What, like a 95-year-old detective?
[231:45.50]The cops have closed the file on this one, and that's why I need you.
[231:50.25]I know it was one of the four diseases that let the hammer down on my man.
[231:57.21]I thought that was the same actor from Mega Race.
[232:23.99]and he placed a few bets in my book but I didn't shoot him I pack a pencil they don't make them like this anymore they just don't somebody wasted a lot of bullets if I ever had a hundred million dollars guys if I ever had like a ton of money gangsters I would make sure that these came back I would do everything in my power I don't care if I lost everything for bad guys and there's even a
[232:50.55]And it would be shot in 16 millimeter.
[232:53.09]No new 4K bullshit.
[232:54.61]No, fuck that.
[232:55.13]It would look like this.
[232:56.37]Oh, sweet talk, Johnny Rock.
[232:59.21]Sure, he used to sing here.
[233:00.49]I was going to make him a star.
[233:03.39]Why would I do him in?
[233:05.99]Do I look like I'm hurting?
[233:08.81]Maybe it was that weasel they call measles.
[233:13.52]You know, me and Johnny had something in common.
[233:16.76]Dynamite.
[233:18.07]Oh, no, they're showing us the whole... They're doing the trailer thing, the thing that I told you about I don't like.
[233:22.06]There's so much glass.
[233:24.18]Oh, man, look at this.
[233:26.22]Wow.
[233:47.40]That guy rolled all the way back on his head.
[233:48.94]That guy gave a fuck.
[233:51.08]That guy cared.
[233:58.54]Why is he calling me a wimp?
[234:09.51]Why is he showing me the title screen again?
[234:13.51]Wait, how do I play?
[234:14.29]Oh, okay, there we go, there we go.
[234:15.83]Okay, start.
[234:16.87]Should we calibrate?
[234:45.54]Okay.
[234:49.57]I was hoping it would be speed of the cursor.
[234:59.41]Solve the murder of Johnny Rock.
[235:00.69]As a private investigator, you must search for clues, learn the combination to Johnny Rock's safe, and discover who shot him from the evidence found in the safe.
[235:07.96]Look at how slow this is.
[235:12.89]The number on the slip of paper in Johnny Rock's hand is your lucky number.
[235:18.11]This number will appear several times during the game.
[235:20.89]Shoot your lucky number to win game money.
[235:23.15]I have 400 bullets.
[235:35.25]There's someone to see you, boss.
[235:37.76]As soon as I saw her, I...
[235:46.62]Let me start over.
[235:48.02]Let me start over.
[236:00.69]I'm one of the sloths from that fucking animal movie.
[236:10.69]Why do I have 400 bullets?
[236:23.46]Yeah, Zootopia.
[236:29.45]That's the bad guy.
[236:30.63]Got him.
[236:50.91]Someone shot my boyfriend, Johnny Rock.
[236:54.10]And I want you to find out who it was.
[236:56.88]Johnny Rock.
[236:58.14]He was a singer.
[236:59.58]He always wanted to be on the hit parade.
[237:02.04]And that night, somebody made his wish come true.
[237:06.51]What the fuck?
[237:09.23]When I got to Johnny Rock, I found this in his hand.
[237:13.49]Three.
[237:16.03]Johnny.
[237:16.67]Johnny, are you there?
[237:17.92]Johnny, what's the lucky number?
[237:19.38]Johnny.
[237:21.45]You could have guessed it.
[237:22.27]Johnny and I, you can call me Red.
[237:25.30]If three is your password, it will take you 15 seconds.
[237:30.12]Johnny had the goods on somebody.
[237:32.06]Has it gone in that fucking rose?
[237:33.36]I want you to find them.
[237:36.62]I asked if she was... She said she didn't think so.
[237:40.42]Besides, how do you turn down a dame that gives you roses?
[237:43.04]Two guys come in with big containers with roses.
[237:46.85]The key to the mystery will be found in Johnny's safe.
[237:58.97]Let's give that heart a listen Shit what the fuck Cheese Swiss cheese
[238:24.62]I... I shot that guy a hundred times.
[238:38.50]Nurse, give me a hose.

[239:48.97]Then I made my second mistake.
[239:50.91]I said, I'd try.
[239:51.85]And then I opened the telegram.
[239:55.85]I'm doing drugs.
[239:57.82]I can't read this.

[245:53.90]What do you want?
[245:54.86]I told him that I wanted his clue to the combination.
[245:57.34]Okay, it's over there.
[245:59.04]It's over there.
[245:59.92]He's going to fall down and watch.
[246:03.50]What?
[246:04.06]What is this?
[246:04.70]What do you mean it's over there?
[246:08.39]What was that?
[246:09.05]That was some girl?
[246:21.00]You've put on a little weight.
[246:23.46]How does it feel to lose it?
[246:30.84]I don't have any money.
[246:40.33]That guy unloaded his whole weapon.
[246:46.11]Okay, let's go to the... I don't know.
[246:47.71]What's the easiest one?
[246:56.69]Oh, I just got bullets.
[247:00.00]Casino.
[247:00.60]I got to remember this.
[247:01.46]You got to memorize everything.
[247:03.56]Why are they doing this to me?
[247:04.80]I'm dead.
[247:05.72]Okay.
[247:24.47]I remember, I remember I... I'm so confused at what's going on.
[247:35.23]Don't revisit an area?
[247:36.57]Well, didn't I just lose?
[247:37.49]Okay, I guess it's saving my progress.
[247:41.39]What's this place?
[247:47.89]Okay.
[247:49.68]Let's give that heart a listen.
[248:04.24]I pre-fired that guy and it didn't even kill him.
[248:17.70]Can I not shoot through the gate?
[248:19.04]Alright, it's casino then.
[248:33.38]The casino I knew Johnny Rocket played in this price dealer guy lady.
[248:39.34]I showed him my 38.
[248:48.10]There she was in the purple Cape Lockjaw Lil.
[248:51.47]She was the tight lipped team that I needed to talk to.
[248:54.43]This one was random though.
[248:55.63]This was hard to time.
[248:56.35]Maybe this guy right here.
[249:11.94]Shit!
[249:12.34]Okay, so it's top left, right, top right.
[249:19.95]I think I'm dead though.
[249:22.11]It's okay.
[249:27.23]No, I didn't want to go here!
[249:28.17]I actually didn't mean to click that.
[249:30.37]Oh no, that's bad.
[249:35.08]I don't work for free.
[249:36.42]You make a good stiff.
[249:41.52]A bad shot, but a good stiff.
[249:44.98]Out of money.
[249:45.70]I think we're still fine.
[249:49.64]Alright, back to the casino.
[249:51.82]The casino?
[249:52.60]Yeah, we're good.
[249:53.14]I knew Johnny Rocket played in this private club.
[249:56.41]What's a password?
[249:57.91]Top left, bottom right, top right.
[250:06.55]Oh, it's randomized.
[250:07.25]Oh, that sucks ass.
[250:08.67]I got to start in the middle and just be ready to move.
[250:37.30]There's a guy that hides under how many options?
[250:39.60]There's five different options.
[250:47.28]I almost just shot that.
[250:50.65]It's playing with my hands are covered in cookie dough batter.
[250:54.35]Put on a little weight.
[250:56.61]How does it feel to lose it?
[251:01.65]What are you doing here?
[251:02.69]There's no evidence here.
[251:38.25]Ugh!
[251:41.37]What is that shit?!
[251:42.85]It just- the- the game- the disk loaded and it skipped my game!
[251:45.59]I- here's something I'm gonna tell you not to do.
[251:56.39]I'm gonna tell you not to jump out of behind cover screaming and say, JUMP!
[252:18.24]This is gonna be, this one's gonna be so hard.
[252:20.96]No!
[252:22.28]Oh, it's so hard because the disk loads when a guy shows up on screen and skips the cursor.
[252:48.12]I swear to God.
[252:49.04]This lady.
[252:49.70]Same lady.
[253:13.78]Oh, I thought it was going to be the guy on the left.
[253:15.02]I thought it was going to be the guy over here.
[253:24.07]It's so hard to go from middle of the screen to over here and not get killed by it.
[253:29.79]If I have infinite continues, I'm cool.
[253:31.11]Got it.
[253:46.58]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[253:48.06]It was it like pulled me look at that.
[253:49.82]It did like a It's Betty bye for this private eye better luck next time I'll get it
[254:38.73]That was actually kind of bullshit.
[254:41.84]I hit that and you saw it.
[254:43.24]That was perfect.
[255:02.78]Dearly beloved, we are gathered together today for the unfortunate demise of an innocent bystander.
[255:11.18]Okay.
[255:14.26]Thank you.
[255:18.16]That's so small.
[255:19.35]It's so hard to get over there.
[255:20.69]Alright.
[255:23.17]Ten more tries and I'm done.
[255:25.81]Ten more tries.
[255:27.45]You make a good stiff.
[255:29.07]A bad shot, but a good stiff.
[255:55.37]No!
[255:56.49]I fucking knew it!
[256:08.66]Come on!
[256:09.38]Come on!
[256:10.00]Come on!
[256:10.30]If it wasn't random... I got him.
[256:23.81]Don't do that.
[256:36.70]I have a new strat.
[256:44.05]Come on.
[256:48.23]Excuse me?
[256:59.98]What are you talking about?
[257:16.04]My cursor was covering his head.
[257:17.88]Thank god I missed.
[257:52.40]How did I not hit that guy?
[257:54.08]I knew he was going to show up there.
[257:55.37]The controller just ripped to the left.
[258:12.81]This level is going to drive me crazy.
[258:14.85]Oh, come on, man.
[258:25.75]I don't work for free.
[258:30.89]I'm so glad I can just do this an infinite amount of times.
[258:34.89]No, don't!
[258:53.55]I shot him right in the head.
[258:54.51]I keep coming back.
[259:07.61]I'm here to bargain.
[259:12.49]I'm here to bargain.
[259:24.64]That one is so horrible.
[259:25.74]What was wrong with that?
[259:32.87]You have to lag the game up.
[259:59.03]I shot it around her.
[260:02.39]It was like a cartoon.
[260:05.58]I almost did it.
[260:06.12]That's it.
[260:18.03]What the fuck are you talking about?
[260:20.99]Why is it impossible?
[260:23.39]That's impossible.
[260:28.37]What?
[260:29.05]It's the same guy twice.
[260:30.27]Come on.
[260:56.59]I need to do it.
[261:02.39]I have to do it.
[261:03.36]I'm so close.
[261:04.46]I've come this far.
[261:31.88]I got him.
[261:35.53]Alright, now here comes this guy right in the middle.
[261:44.33]Oh shit.
[261:48.24]You're crazy!
[261:49.52]You're gonna end up a corpse just like Johnny!
[261:52.30]I told Lil I just wanted the facts.
[261:54.87]I loved Johnny.
[261:56.81]I was gonna make him a star.
[261:59.31]Then I told the bleeding heart I just wanted her clue to Johnny's combination.
[262:04.94]This is what you need to look for.
[262:06.66]A cat.
[262:10.48]Alright, I got a cat, a doll.
[262:19.65]Get over to the pool hall and hustle up some extra cash.
[262:24.71]Okay, back to the pool hall.
[262:25.89]I got 2,000 bucks.
[262:35.12]Did I do it?
[262:40.76]I can't, I had to make some money.
[262:42.36]What are you talking, what?
[262:44.38]I didn't make any money.
[263:02.03]I went to the garage to find a disease named pox.
[263:06.31]I knew it.
[263:07.05]How would you not think that was gonna happen?
[263:09.61]Hey, why don't you show them that rod we just greased up, boys?
[263:19.16]Okay, that person is so blurry that they're just part of the car next to them on the right.
[263:28.47]I went to the garage to find a disease.
[263:30.53]You shot a kid?
[263:31.67]No.
[263:31.95]So you're the bright boy.
[263:34.95]Beat it.
[263:35.59]Hey, why don't you show them that rod we just greased up, boys?
[263:47.94]Now you.
[263:51.18]Now who?
[263:54.83]He's still alive.
[263:55.69]He's still alive.
[263:56.61]That blob over there is still alive.
[263:58.41]You gotta get this guy twice.
[264:26.88]Okay, then the guy pops up on the right.
[264:28.28]Sorry, I was reading chat.
[264:39.32]This is something very funny.
[264:40.38]Somebody said, hey, can you increase the screen resolution at all?
[264:44.66]The answer to that question is, unfortunately, absolutely no.
[264:55.47]This is the crunchiness that we have to deal with.
[265:03.58]Then somebody right here.
[265:15.19]Whoa!
[265:18.11]I told him, no more monkey business.
[265:21.00]So Johnny owed me a little money.
[265:22.74]So what?
[265:23.20]Everybody does.
[265:24.18]I got nothing to hide.
[265:25.68]I asked him for the clue to the safe.
[265:29.36]Alright, alright.
[265:30.70]I don't even have to grease my pocket.
[265:32.26]It's there.
[265:32.88]Imagine if the world was just like this.
[265:37.32]It seems like every person that we come across, all these people in every business, everyone has a cartoon character.
[265:45.64]Hold your lucky number at the casino and make out like a bandit.
[265:50.65]Okay, casino.
[265:54.64]Didn't I just... Alright, zero.
[265:58.54]Do I have to pick?
[266:05.63]I don't want to shoot it.
[266:24.59]No money?
[266:26.01]Take him to the morgue.
[266:30.11]Out of money, out of luck.
[266:31.76]That's the name of the game.
[266:38.24]Okay.
[266:39.46]Well, I guess we're going to the warehouse.
[266:48.57]Cheese.
[266:50.21]You remind me of Swiss cheese.
[266:53.58]The number was three?
[266:54.46]Can I just not wait?
[267:02.82]But I don't think I... I don't know.
[267:04.02]I didn't think I was getting one opportunity to do that in the whole game.
[267:09.95]You can only do it once.
[267:11.23]Oh, shit.
[267:13.85]Okay.
[267:19.29]I remember this.
[267:26.08]I definitely did play this because I remember that exact scream.
[267:29.83]I don't know if I ever beat it though.
[267:38.16]I thought I had an extra half second.
[267:53.89]Oh, come on.
[267:57.71]You for sure did not beat it because of all the trouble I'm having?
[268:00.56]I would have assumed.
[268:01.22]I only did like two or three levels.
[268:09.24]Free fire.
[268:13.96]Now you?
[268:14.44]Yep.
[268:25.94]uh that person was invisible no money get him out of here it's Betty bye for this private eye better luck next time I said this game sucks LOL no it does not
[268:56.55]To be fair though, I don't think that guy hit me.
[269:00.02]I don't think any of those bullets actually connect.
[269:05.10]What's going on?
[269:20.19]Shit, how did I not hit him?
[269:25.47]I fought my way inside the high explosives factory.
[269:28.25]I found the character I needed to talk to.
[269:30.33]I splashed acid on my face, so they call me Measles.
[269:34.85]We're gonna bleach your bones.
[269:40.17]My what?
[269:50.08]I knew it.
[269:50.84]I knew he was gonna be right there.
[269:56.91]Look at this.
[269:59.27]How can you even see this guy?
[270:04.09]Looks like a... Oh, shit.
[270:05.71]Okay, I'm almost there.
[270:35.45]And then you.
[270:41.06]That guy was a piece of machinery in my brain.
[270:42.86]He was not.
[270:45.32]These guys are all pieces of equipment.
[270:55.95]He just went into the acid.
[270:58.23]Oh my god.
[271:01.83]Was that supposed to prevent that guy from going into the acid?
[271:04.72]We're gonna have to shorten your nickname, slugger.
[271:18.12]alright alright copper arrest me I run a clean operation just a little dynamite I wasn't a cop any more than he ran a clean operation me and Johnny we had a deal it was gonna be partners I asked him for his clue to the safe yeah okay okay here it is I had no idea what that was supposed to mean uh this is the best way I could have drawn what he described to me you got all the info there is chief
[271:48.19]After the mansion, you better save some cash for a bulletproof vest.
[271:54.59]What did she just say?
[271:55.21]Because I just didn't pick a place.
[272:09.85]I don't work for free.
[272:14.15]Get the bulletproof vest.
[272:15.21]Out of luck.
[272:15.85]That's the name of the game.
[272:19.30]Where do I get that?
[272:20.02]I wasn't listening.
[272:23.20]Uh... In here?
[272:25.30]This ammo.
[272:29.24]The mansion.
[272:32.78]There's a mansion?
[272:37.20]Didn't I already do the JR?
[272:39.59]I thought I already did it.
[272:46.29]Oh.
[272:53.13]Somebody just got shot in that window.
[272:56.11]That's not a window you should be jumping into.
[273:18.56]I do... I do like the single window gameplay.
[273:23.33]Oh my god, I thought it was going to be a fake out.
[273:29.95]What?
[273:30.88]Why are we starting with that one?
[273:31.94]Dearly beloved, we are gathered together today for the unfortunate demise of an innocent bystander.
[274:06.31]Come on!
[274:07.05]Oh my goodness, it was the first guy again.
[274:40.25]I thought it was the lady again.
[274:43.47]Single window gameplay is actually hard.
[274:49.54]I know I messed up.
[274:50.44]I know I messed it up.
[274:52.68]Oh my god, I keep killing this guy.
[275:02.00]I keep killing the... I almost did it.
[275:19.02]That was the same actor as the guy that said don't.
[275:34.27]Johnny's mansion.
[275:35.39]Now I had to get inside.
[275:43.80]Johnny's mansion.
[275:44.92]Now I had to get inside.
[275:53.14]Well, they didn't even get that in frame.
[275:55.96]How are you supposed to see that?
[276:00.53]Very carefully.
[276:01.71]On an old CRT TV with the brightness and the contrast all the way up.
[276:12.31]Johnny's mansion.
[276:13.45]Now I had to get inside.
[276:24.83]I knew it.
[276:25.35]Okay, so boom, boom, left, and then probably top left.
[276:28.38]This is so crunchy.
[276:35.18]I can't see.
[276:36.02]Here.
[276:36.24]I'm going to assume here.
[276:53.89]Damn it.
[276:54.31]Okay.
[276:54.69]This should save there.
[276:59.72]I wasn't even ready.
[277:06.66]Holy shit.
[277:07.30]This is going to be horrible.
[277:09.00]That's how...
[277:40.66]Shit.
[277:43.90]I'm so close to beating this.
[277:45.30]I've never beaten this before.
[277:46.84]I have to continue.
[277:49.52]You make a good stiff.
[277:51.14]A bad shot, but a good stiff.
[278:05.09]Oh my goodness, you were over there.
[278:08.80]I'll get it.
[278:09.16]Oh my God.
[278:17.30]This sucks.
[278:25.65]Let's get... It's so hard to control it.
[278:31.89]You have no idea.
[278:42.03]Oh, man.
[278:46.64]Try pause buffering.
[278:50.74]Terrible idea here.
[278:52.28]That's true.
[279:24.91]It's too hard.
[279:25.61]I think that's actually the strategy.
[279:35.42]I have to just... I have to just spam.
[279:37.12]It doesn't even help.
[280:00.74]I can't even get over there in time.
[280:02.06]Oh, do I have to give up on this?
[280:08.34]Do I actually have to quit it?
[280:09.60]Do I actually have to quit this?
[280:33.12]I definitely would have hit it with one of those.
[280:35.04]Alright, I gotta... That's so bullshit.
[280:44.79]That's so bullshit.
[280:51.73]I'm gonna run out of bullets.
[280:52.61]Well, I'm gonna die.
[280:54.79]Alright, 10 more official tries.
[280:56.11]That's right.
[280:58.81]Okay, that doesn't count.
[280:59.87]This counts.
[281:01.91]Here comes one.
[281:14.14]You shot everywhere around him?
[281:24.77]Here's the thing.
[281:25.25]There's no... I don't have an analog.
[281:27.57]So it's... This is one.
[281:30.05]This is me hitting down.
[281:31.61]Tapping down.
[281:33.05]Tapping left.
[281:34.52]It actually moves pretty far.
[281:36.12]This is... Look at this.
[281:38.00]I just tapped down.
[281:40.42]Tap.
[281:40.78]Down.
[281:41.60]Tap.
[281:42.12]Wait, I didn't continue.
[281:52.77]Oh my fucking god, I can't believe I have to like prove to people that the game is hard.
[281:58.37]No, I'm good, right?
[281:59.29]Yeah.
[282:01.57]Yeah, see?
[282:02.81]Like, I'm just tapping it once.
[282:04.71]Okay.
[282:16.75]It's so difficult to get it in that spot.
[282:19.90]Alright, six more tries.
[282:49.53]I'm at the final level of Johnny Rocket.
[282:53.51]I have to do it.
[282:54.53]You have to pause.
[282:56.15]I think I have to pause bumper.
[283:00.77]I think you're right.
[283:12.61]Okay, top window.
[283:13.47]Oh my god, I'm not gonna be able to get over there fast enough.
[283:21.99]Okay.
[283:26.46]Okay, there he is.
[283:29.20]Got him.
[283:33.16]Right there.
[283:38.08]Is it the right or the window?
[283:41.70]Right there.
[283:42.64]Come on.
[283:45.76]Window.
[283:49.08]Nope.
[283:49.48]Right here again.
[283:52.18]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[283:53.60]My finger slipped because I had to press three buttons at the same time.
[284:01.80]Oh my god.
[284:03.70]I have to hold B, press start, and then spam A.
[284:17.28]Where is he?
[284:18.45]Up there.
[284:31.83]There he is.
[284:32.17]Right there.
[284:58.85]Again, this window here.
[285:06.37]Okay, the left side.
[285:09.19]It just went down.
[285:10.55]I didn't want it to go down.
[285:11.83]I pressed left and it went down.
[285:13.91]I swear to you.
[285:15.17]Fuck you.
[285:39.89]Oh my god.
[285:40.61]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[285:44.77]Oh my god.
[285:52.96]Okay, let's go.
[286:11.44]I'm not going to get it.
[286:12.02]This is fucking impossible.
[286:22.87]You make a good stiff.
[286:24.49]A bad shot, but a good stiff.
[286:38.37]Nurse.
[286:49.39]okay last ride rider is it oh my god do you see what it just did look at that
[287:21.38]Up top.
[287:27.45]I... Oh my god.

[288:44.84]what the fuck alright alright alright alright alright this is just not completable no human can do this
[289:16.45]I have an idea.
[289:17.83]This idea is just stupid enough to work.
[289:19.32]Alright, I have to pause it.
[289:24.67]Now we go like this.
[289:46.28]Oh my God, you had to be... I already shot the guy up there once.
[289:50.49]No, I don't want to go to the warehouse.
[289:59.23]Oh my God, man, this is so ridiculous.
[290:02.57]Why is it so impossible?
[290:06.11]You gotta be kidding me.
[290:12.61]The thing is that pressing left sometimes presses down.
[290:29.44]Yeah, dude, the controller is so fucked up.
[290:32.78]I just pressed down and it went up.
[290:35.38]It's just like this thing is fucking 50 years old.
[290:38.30]Use your mouse?
[290:47.12]I'm using a real 3DO, bro.
[291:00.76]Did you read the title?
[291:01.74]Original Hardware.
[291:06.67]Bro.
[291:16.57]Apparently that didn't work this time.
[291:17.61]Alright.
[291:20.12]Last three attempts for real.
[291:23.40]I don't know why that didn't work this time.
[291:27.26]I didn't want to press that button either.
[291:28.44]I'm done.
[291:33.10]Hey, go watch the end of it on YouTube.
[291:34.97]I don't give a shit anymore.
[291:35.97]Okay.
[291:42.73]Next, we're going to do... This one here.
[291:50.35]This one's called Syndicate.
[291:55.72]Syndicate.
[291:56.74]Should be fun.
[292:00.76]You're a quitter.
[292:01.52]I'm going to sit there all day.
[292:03.37]It's never going to happen.
[292:36.00]It's sometimes it's just actually just not even possible.
[292:49.11]It's the disk loads.
[292:51.47]And when a disk is loading, it does, it does not register that you did anything.
[293:07.09]is it?
[293:07.35]Okay.
[293:12.00]Alright.
[293:12.42]Alright.
[293:12.64]Alright.
[293:12.84]Alright.
[293:13.10]Last one for real.
[293:14.20]And I'm ripping this thing out and fucking burning it.
[293:17.23]Last one after this.
[293:38.41]Does that work?
[293:40.39]I just put it on easy.
[293:44.20]That's not as... I wonder what hard is like.
[293:46.37]Holy shit.
[294:06.75]Did you see it jump?
[294:07.93]Did you see it jump to the left for no reason?
[294:10.93]I didn't press that button.
[294:18.47]I had it.
[294:20.43]Did you see?
[294:20.95]Did you see that?
[294:21.73]Did you see?
[294:22.15]Of course you did.
[294:22.73]You're watching it.
[294:29.84]Again, the game, the disk loaded and it... You know what?
[294:33.32]I don't even fucking explain what happened.
[294:54.13]You can't go, there's no diagonal because you just, I did a circle around it.
[294:59.24]It's awful.
[295:34.87]What?
[295:35.15]What?
[295:35.61]What?
[295:36.21]I don't have any bullets.
[295:54.78]I can't.
[295:55.36]I actually can't believe that.
[295:58.96]I can't believe it.
[295:59.84]I locked in so hard too.
[296:01.38]Okay.
[296:02.14]Alright, alright.
[296:02.98]That's it.
[296:03.42]That's it.
[296:03.76]That's actually it.
[296:10.70]I can't do it anymore.
[296:11.24]I'm going to play Syndicate.
[296:11.98]I don't want to play this anymore.
[296:19.56]These have been tough.
[296:25.45]There are like 25 more screens like that after the... Oh my god.
[296:28.63]Thank goodness I left.
[296:41.22]I'm probably going to end after this one.
[296:45.55]However this one goes.
[297:01.83]And then... We'll go from there.
[297:06.72]Okay.
[297:18.34]Who shot Johnny Rock?
[297:20.40]I did.
[297:28.71]It was me.
[297:38.77]Okay.
[297:58.93]They just ran that guy over, what?
[298:00.39]Oh my god!
[298:00.71]Do they have eyes?
[298:52.58]Subject code, Bob.
[298:54.44]Anatomical scan.
[298:56.56]Corporation, retina scan.
[299:02.12]Complete.
[299:03.10]Brain scan, complete.
[299:04.78]Intelligence level, adrenaline, set.
[299:21.60]Didn't they just run this guy over?
[299:33.16]Syndicate.
[299:35.23]Rated R. Made by Bullfrog.
[299:38.73]Which is interesting.
[299:41.15]Original old Bullfrog.
[299:43.21]This is an EA game.
[299:44.13]This was a long time ago.
[299:52.44]Configure company.
[300:02.14]Kind of like the frog.
[300:02.98]That one.
[300:24.81]Zed.
[300:33.19]Your name.
[300:37.78]Zed.
[300:38.50]Okay.
[300:42.56]Uh...
[300:55.99]Why pick my boy my picking?
[300:58.59]Their taxes.
[301:02.49]Colorado.
[301:03.27]Alright, let's go to.
[301:10.04]The southern states.
[301:16.10]I can't.
[301:16.47]I can't go here.
[301:18.45]Where can I go?
[301:24.75]New England.
[301:33.53]How do I start?
[301:34.43]Oh OK, I guess we're going to Canada.
[301:50.79]Okay.
[301:50.97]Special Agent.
[301:51.65]Special Agent Bush.
[302:22.36]equip pistol two pistols oops shotgun purchase shotgun leg modifications purchase let's do arms purchase
[302:55.54]I have a better brain.
[302:56.78]research
[303:23.30]research legs v2 do it what how much how much money do I have that much okay let's go
[303:58.20]Assassinate, why are you just walking in?
[304:11.54]Anybody here?
[304:25.33]Use the shotgun.
[304:25.97]I like the music.
[304:55.58]Shoot him!
[305:02.58]Nice.
[305:03.22]Okay.
[305:03.70]Uh-oh.
[305:17.41]Alright, everybody come in.
[305:22.63]Seems kind of like Fallout Tactics.
[305:35.74]When did this come out, I wonder?
[305:36.70]I'm going to say 1994, 1993.
[305:55.21]Unit lost.
[305:56.67]Building unit lost.
[306:00.53]Chronosphere charging.
[306:01.78]That's not your phone.
[306:23.54]He does not care.
[306:27.18]This is a port.
[306:27.90]It was on PC and Amiga.
[306:29.72]The Amiga is another one that would be fun to play.
[306:42.83]Where is this target?
[306:45.27]I had this on Amiga.
[306:46.49]I feel like the Amiga would be hard to, unless you emulate it, it'd be hard to find a lot of stuff for it, I think.
[306:58.06]I'm not sure where I'm going here, but.
[307:06.02]I also want to play a lot of old PC stuff too.
[307:09.44]And I know that we're just kind of rifling through a bunch of random stuff.
[307:14.44]but they're like point and click adventure games and random RPGs that would be fun to do.
[307:23.10]I definitely want to try them.
[307:27.96]I've been in a retro mood very recently, especially since UFO 50.
[307:31.36]Got any guns?
[308:02.17]Is that the target?
[308:02.89]I feel like that's the target.
[308:13.27]Fallout 1.
[308:17.29]Maybe.
[308:17.59]I guess we just have to wait for him to come back out.
[308:21.55]Select it.
[308:23.99]Select it.
[308:24.61]Select it.
[308:26.99]Select it.
[308:33.86]Is the radar pulse the target?
[308:35.26]I don't know.
[308:37.63]Shoot him!
[308:40.61]Get him!
[308:43.27]Did I use my bullets?
[308:45.65]Shoot him!
[308:50.35]I just put the gun on the ground.
[308:53.31]Oh shit.
[309:03.65]Alright, this one was crazy, but I'm not good enough to play it.
[309:08.77]I need the instruction manual.
[309:13.86]Okay, I think that's going to be it for now.
[309:16.44]That was fun.
[309:21.64]I still have like 10, 12 more of these.
[309:30.31]I saved a bunch of really good ones because I knew I was going to do this again.
[309:36.47]So I don't know when, maybe, what's today?
[309:38.27]Today is, what, Thursday, Wednesday?
[309:42.55]It's Wednesday.
[309:48.92]Maybe next week?
[309:55.44]Maybe at some point, maybe early next week?
[310:05.43]Oh my God, that means I've streamed three times in November.
[310:08.71]Are you kidding me?
[310:13.11]That's ridiculous.
[310:15.06]Can you believe it?
[310:22.46]Yeah, we'll do some more 3DO, probably finish up with 3DO.
[310:26.64]And then might pull up some more kind of old PC stuff.
[310:36.43]Hope you enjoyed it.
[310:37.05]I just got the itch to play old, crusty, kind of sloppy games.
[310:45.84]I love the grab bag stuff.
[310:49.24]Kind of never know what you're going to get.
[310:51.36]Could get a complete banger or you could get just something weird.
[310:59.53]And I haven't done this in a very long time and I liked it a lot.
[311:01.81]I had a lot of fun.
[311:04.41]So we'll do it again.
[311:04.97]We'll do some more 3DO.
[311:05.97]I did save a couple of really, really interesting looking ones for next time.
[311:12.32]I wanted to make sure there was a good amount of scuff, but cool, but fun.
[311:19.52]We'll see if I get it next time as well.
[311:23.72]Alright.
[311:24.08]I'll see you later.
[311:24.67]Thanks for hanging out.
[311:25.35]I'll see you guys in like a week.
[311:27.13]Maybe this weekend.
[311:27.93]Take a look at Sus.
[311:35.29]Hope you had a good time.
[311:37.93]And that's it.
[311:39.34]Take care.
[311:39.64]See you soon.
[311:42.10]Have a great rest of your night.
[311:45.72]Is there something else I wanted to talk about?
[311:46.84]I feel like there was.
[311:48.78]Anytime I play old stuff like this and I have to pay a lot of attention to the game because they're always just so ridiculous.
[311:53.80]I probably had a drive-thru story for you probably.
[311:57.01]I don't know.
[311:57.47]Who knows?
[312:13.19]How's production going on the candle?
[312:16.32]It's going well.
[312:18.46]I opened up Unreal Engine 5.
[312:23.52]And I did five tutorials.
[312:28.70]And then I closed it.
[312:33.66]And I made a cube.
[312:36.14]And I know what LOD is, like loading when you do the triangles.
[312:44.41]And then I just watched three more without doing anything in the program because I said to myself, I'm not good enough to use the program, but I'm just going to watch this person do the program.
[312:57.20]And I'm not actually learning.
[312:58.20]I'm just watching somebody else teach.
[313:01.83]Got to really get in there.
[313:03.17]Got to get in there and learn.
[313:15.05]Let's play Unreal Engine.
[313:18.41]I don't think anyone would want to watch that.
[313:25.50]Now, I've always just been curious about what an engine even was.
[313:27.74]I always knew what it was, but just wanted to get kind of in there and just see.
[313:40.25]Yeah, it's fun to go back and look at yesteryear.
[313:43.03]The 3DO is an A-tier console.
[313:45.96]Doesn't matter how much I talked about Johnny Rock.
[313:50.90]Talked a little bit of shit about the end level there, but you know.
[313:54.02]Hey, that's just the way it is.
[313:55.00]It's original hardware.
[313:56.02]You gotta go for it.
[314:00.93]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[314:02.17]Take care.
[314:03.05]See you next week.
[314:05.07]At some point, probably.
[314:14.40]Drink some water.
[314:16.94]Go do something.
[314:18.58]Go play some old stuff.
[314:19.77]Go play some old games.
[314:24.13]Go get some weird old fucked up thing and just play it.
[314:28.97]It's really fun.
[314:30.41]I'll tell you, if you have a group of friends, say you have a Discord or a group with people, or you have buddies in real life that you see, it actually is really fun to just kind of go get a grab bag of... Usually, for the most part, a lot of these games are pretty... Some of them can be expensive, but a lot of times they're between $5 and $10.
[314:57.17]Go grab it like instead of spending 50 bucks on some new game that comes out, you're going to play for an hour and not give a shit about in 10, you know, less than three or four hours.
[315:06.81]Fun to get in a room with people and just get a little grab bag and just mess around.
[315:12.64]Go buy like, you know, three or four of them, five of them.
[315:15.98]Instead of spending the 50 bucks there.
[315:17.48]And you can just sit around and just have fun.
[315:21.74]Just like exactly what we do here.
[315:23.44]The same exact kind of stuff we do here.
[315:24.98]It's a lot of fun.
[315:30.56]You should play the Piglet horror game.
[315:31.96]I keep seeing that.
[315:37.60]I don't know if it's a mod of Clocktower or not.
[315:52.66]Silent Hill Kids Edition.
[315:55.58]It's an actual game.
[315:56.68]No, it's just fucked up.
[316:01.13]It's a normal game.
[316:02.09]It's just really screwed up.
[316:03.51]It's an original game.
[316:04.53]What?
[316:06.01]I thought it was like... The... Chris Redfield with the banana in his hand and no pants on.
[316:13.13]I thought it was somebody just modded it.
[316:15.09]Okay, well, it's real.
[316:15.97]Alright.
[316:26.08]Alright, see you guys later.
[316:27.04]Take care.
[316:28.06]Call your mother.
[316:30.38]See you soon.
