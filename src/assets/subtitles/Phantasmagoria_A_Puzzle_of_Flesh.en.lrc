[00:03.13]Uh, we have two options here.
[00:04.57]I think we're going to do this one first.
[00:09.80]No, I almost just double-clicked this.
[00:12.60]And it would have been funny.
[00:13.62]You know, it is going to be funny for a minute.
[00:15.58]It's going to be funny for a second.
[00:17.52]Hold on.
[00:22.73]We're not going to play this.
[00:23.65]I'm just doing it for a joke.
[00:28.73]It's only to make everybody laugh for a second.
[00:43.13]Only to make you laugh for one minute.
[00:44.96]Because I bought them both.
[01:12.26]It's Phantasmagoria 2.
[01:13.68]We're not going to play this.
[01:28.51]So the first game, he gets syringed.

[02:34.30]In this Hitman syringe.
[02:40.75]What did they just put in his mouth?
[02:43.65]No, I thought that was the syringe.
[02:44.83]No, it's not.
[02:45.73]Here we go.
[02:46.01]He's gonna get electrocuted.

[23:13.53]Nice work.
[23:17.71]We're not going to play it.
[23:18.65]We're going to get to the point where this guy's head explodes.
[23:22.95]And then we'll be done.
[23:27.31]That's it.
[23:27.67]That's all I want to do.
[23:28.29]Is this the same coworker?
[23:36.90]This is a different lady.
[23:39.16]I'm so confused right now.

[24:13.37]This is a try to get fired game.
[24:20.07]I'm just thinking about him a little bit.
[24:23.84]I'm just thinking about him a little bit.
[24:26.50]Not a big deal.
[24:28.72]Alright, so this has been a real trip.
[24:33.34]There's this guy.
[24:39.46]I think we found all the desks.
[24:41.84]This is the last one.
[24:42.66]Have we seen this person?
[24:43.54]I think this is my desk.
[24:45.00]Why can I not go in here?
[24:51.45]Should I put my pictures on here?
[24:58.37]No.
[25:01.83]Are they open now?
[25:04.89]Should I go to the other place?
[25:07.94]I can go up here.
[25:09.88]This is just leaving.
[25:15.29]What did you miss?
[25:16.29]Not very much.
[25:18.41]I need to steal somebody's keycard.
[25:19.65]This guy's got four globes on his desk.
[25:25.23]Alright, let's go.
[25:28.86]Is this place open now?
[25:30.94]No, it's not.
[25:32.52]We obviously need another keycard.
[25:36.83]I missed a cubicle.
[25:39.71]I did.
[25:43.13]It's like so finicky to try to get into each one.
[25:46.43]Is this one?
[25:49.35]This is the one with this guy.
[25:51.05]I don't see a key.
[25:51.65]There's got to be somebody's like key.
[25:52.61]Look at all these keys, right?
[25:58.28]Go back to the boss.
[25:58.98]Well, didn't he say all the last?
[26:00.70]I don't want to see any more of like Paul like Stevenson ever again.
[26:04.22]What the fuck his name was?
[26:05.22]Paul Stevenson.
[26:19.17]Not this one.
[26:20.19]Come on.
[26:24.43]Oh, fine.
[26:24.91]I finally found my office.
[26:26.44]I'm going to turn on the computer and then finally going to get to move on here.
[26:33.98]I'm not supposed to be playing this game.
[26:38.29]Well, good morning, Sleeping Beauty.
[26:41.38]Tim Allen.
[26:42.46]Well, were you, uh, up too late watching Beavis and Butthead?
[26:45.58]Relevant.
[26:46.24]Or organizing your stamp collection?
[26:48.00]Relevant.
[26:48.34]Actually, I was up early this morning.
[26:50.16]My rat stole my wallet.
[26:51.94]Yeah, a likely story.
[26:54.02]Yeah, you just couldn't haul your lazy butt out of bed, huh?
[26:57.71]Huh?
[26:59.71]I, on the other hand, have a social life.
[27:02.49]Uh-huh.
[27:03.17]Ah.
[27:03.94]Yes, I was out dancing Until Dawn.
[27:06.50]I mean, this guy has the same hair right now.
[27:08.51]But here I am on time and fresh as a daisy.
[27:12.31]A daisy, huh?
[27:13.87]You know, I could say something.
[27:15.35]Don't go there.
[27:17.01]Don't go there.
[27:19.23]I'll have to see you later, mean boy.
[27:21.43]Meme?
[27:23.38]He just called him a meme.

[27:29.88]I'll see you later, mean boy.
[27:32.65]This is like from 1991.
[27:35.01]You're such a pretty girl, Blob.
[27:36.35]Let's work on the computer, meme boy.
[27:44.43]Oh crap, I changed my password.
[27:50.49]If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.
[27:53.03]What was it?
[27:54.13]If you hang up, dial again.
[27:55.75]I don't know my password.
[27:57.95]What?
[27:59.77]Oh, come on.
[28:00.49]What's the password?
[28:07.13]Uh, blob.
[28:12.97]Easy.
[28:15.33]It's definitely a blob.
[28:20.11]What?
[28:20.76]Somebody just punched him in the face.

[29:04.31]Make your passwords secure.
[29:08.49]Don't have your password be the name of your pet, your dog's name, your cat's name, your favorite food.
[29:16.16]By social engineering, I was able to crack this guy's password without any time at all.
[29:21.46]Let this be a public service announcement for you.
[29:24.49]Make your password secure.
[29:25.93]Make it something that no one would guess.
[29:28.37]Don't make it your grandmother's birthday.
[29:30.13]I'll figure it out.
[29:32.37]You just post it on Facebook.
[29:34.64]Two weeks ago.
[29:36.26]Happy birthday, Nana.
[29:39.80]October 1st, 1971.
[29:42.08]Happy birthday, Nana.
[29:43.74]I know that's your password now.
[29:45.14]I'll try it.
[29:45.78]Now, what's a phone password?
[30:00.53]It didn't work.
[30:02.12]Alright, let's put my actual phone number in here.
[30:13.16]Alright, let me try that again.
[30:18.28]What?
[30:18.94]Nobody has... What is this?
[30:20.88]Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[30:22.26]This is... This is back in the day when you didn't need to use an area code.
[30:28.19]Now you have to use an area code.
[30:30.31]So this is nostalgia, huh?
[30:32.13]It's only six digits, it's not nine.
[30:39.01]I don't know.
[30:39.65]I don't have any phone numbers.
[30:41.55]Oh, God.
[30:41.91]Yes, I do.
[30:42.79]Let's go.
[30:43.34]Me.
[30:45.88]Okay, let's call Bob.
[30:47.78]6114.
[30:47.80]This is turning into like a fucking prank phone call simulator.
[30:55.41]Yeah, right.
[30:55.91]Like I want to talk to the king of assholes.
[30:59.51]Alright, what about Trevor?

[31:21.33]Wait a minute, you're serious.
[31:22.51]Hey, what's wrong, bud?
[31:24.79]I don't know.
[31:26.17]Somebody punched me in the face on my computer.
[31:27.44]Just bad brains.
[31:28.76]Later, Trev.
[31:29.48]You ever see the movie Click?
[31:31.32]I think there might be a fucking jokester around.
[31:35.65]You mind if I come investigate to make sure you don't have a large, comical, huge changer beeper?
[31:40.57]Who's the next guy?

[32:44.45]Fuck this guy.
[32:45.85]Wow, he's not even going to say it.
[32:48.17]Not even going to say it.
[32:49.80]Bye.
[32:51.32]Well, commitment issues for this guy.
[32:52.90]How old are you, man?
[32:55.74]What is he, what is this guy like 41 and he like won't say I love you?
[32:58.60]What the fuck?

[33:21.27]This is Curtis.
[33:22.47]I'm just calling to let you know that the Veneman document will be finished on time, and I'll just go ahead and post it.
[33:28.05]Alright.
[33:28.45]Thanks.
[33:30.98]Let me ask you guys something, because I know this is like this in office buildings and shit, and I want an explanation.
[33:36.06]I do.
[33:37.82]I want someone to explain this to me, because I don't get it.
[33:42.90]So if you're in an office with people,
[33:45.94]and you're you're potentially sitting 15 fucking feet away from the guy that you're calling or emailing why won't you just go walk over and talk to him it's like I'm calling people's phone numbers that are that guy can hear me talking if that guy had a supersonic hearing aid in he'd be able to hear me from across the whole place why
[34:12.54]What's with that?
[34:13.22]What's with, like, if I call Bob, he can hear me call him and hear me talk to him?
[34:21.80]Alright, 6996.
[34:29.23]Um, sir, this is Curtis Craig.
[34:32.29]I, uh... I'm not doing anything at work.
[34:35.99]Um, um, just fine, sir.
[34:37.39]Thank you.
[34:38.64]You asked me to let you know when the budget documentation was finished, and I posted it on the network late last night.
[34:44.79]I did not.
[34:48.85]I thought this guy was just mad at me.
[34:56.61]There's one more number I didn't call.
[34:57.79]Is this what you do when you work in an office?
[35:02.50]Like, I feel like this guy isn't doing any work.
[35:05.02]Who have I not called?
[35:08.55]3038?
[35:12.55]Am I getting paid to do this?
[35:14.46]Hey, I'm just going to call all the people on my friends list.
[35:17.86]Hey, it's Curtis.
[35:19.82]Hi, what can I do for you?
[35:23.60]Could you... I was wondering if... I... This is going to sound really lame, but I just forgot why I called you.
[35:33.77]That's okay.
[35:36.14]You're doing a good job, man.
[35:40.04]I don't know why I work here.
[35:43.68]Oh, boy.
[35:44.18]I'm starting to realize that I'm not really an asset for the company.
[35:48.88]Shit.
[35:50.65]What do I do here?
[35:51.65]I'm just going to call myself again.

[36:31.96]That's unfortunate.
[36:35.50]Oh well, we tried.
[36:38.09]Tried as hard as we could and we didn't do anything.
[36:40.61]So now do I get to go talk to somebody again?

[43:10.31]You know, you... You look a lot like your mother.
[43:13.81]Yeah.
[43:24.95]He wasn't happy about that.
[43:27.97]You look a lot like your mother.
[43:29.07]My mother's really ugly.
[43:31.49]I can't believe you just fucking said that.
[43:34.55]My mother looks like shit.
[43:35.67]How dare you?
[43:41.23]Alright, let's go over here.
[43:42.11]Over here.

[43:53.33]This guy.
[43:54.81]Hey, Trev.
[43:55.95]Hey, my man.
[43:56.97]What's up?
[43:59.41]Jesus.
[44:00.63]What happened to your face?
[44:03.59]Wait.
[44:04.07]That took a long time.
[44:05.91]I said I don't know.
[44:08.63]Shit, Trev.
[44:08.99]That took a while.
[44:09.63]It was like 30 minutes ago.
[44:11.81]What happened?
[44:12.82]Did somebody hit you or something?
[44:15.38]I swear to God, I was just sitting at my desk.
[44:17.74]And somebody slugged me, but there was nobody there.
[44:23.67]That sounds nuts, doesn't it?
[44:24.65]That's just totally psycho.
[44:26.59]No.
[44:26.95]Of course not.
[44:32.02]Hey, remember when I got the flu and I thought Dolly Parton was in the closet with a chainsaw?
[44:38.82]Whoa, man, that was crazy.
[44:39.86]Probably got a virus.
[44:41.46]Kurt.
[44:42.31]A computer virus?
[44:43.75]I don't know.
[44:45.27]That's probably it.
[44:50.39]Got hit by a train.
[44:52.79]Alright, now, Trevor, let me ask you something.
[44:54.73]Is Trevor looking at an ultrasound?
[44:57.15]Hey, forget about your newborn baby.
[45:02.25]What do you think about my pictures?
[45:05.55]Hey, Trev.
[45:06.47]Look what I got in the mail today.
[45:11.92]Ooh.
[45:13.02]Well, somebody's hot for your little ass, you stud.
[45:19.26]Give it a rest.
[45:21.78]Just don't.
[45:23.52]Have mercy on the poor girl when you find her, Fabio.
[45:26.24]You'll spoil her for all other men if you're not careful.
[45:29.06]How many, um, how many, like, women are in this guy's life?
[45:32.94]That's the third one.
[45:33.76]Alright, what about, uh, what about this picture?
[45:37.58]Do you like this one, too?
[45:38.88]Hey, Trev.
[45:39.28]Look what I found.
[45:41.56]Still haven't done any work.
[45:42.53]I forgot I had this.
[45:44.59]Oh.
[45:45.77]Those your folks?
[45:46.47]Mm-hmm.
[45:47.67]Nice looking couple.
[45:51.66]No, you look a lot like your mom.
[45:53.46]Stop saying that!
[45:54.48]Your eyes.
[45:55.28]God damn it!
[45:58.34]Fuck!
[46:02.58]This guy really doesn't like his mother.
[46:11.05]Hey Trev, you know, I walked all the way out.
[46:14.07]I'm gonna come back in and show you a third picture.
[46:18.68]I keep having, like, issues.
[46:20.94]Take a look at this one.
[46:21.76]Do you remember that party at all?
[46:27.56]Ah, no.
[46:28.16]It's all a blur of white rum, pop music, and really bad food.
[46:34.92]Damn good thing you're a perpetual designated driver.
[46:37.82]Yeah, that's me.
[46:39.06]Sobriety poster child.
[46:40.89]Yeah.
[46:41.75]You know?
[46:42.29]Kind of like your mom.
[46:43.25]I do seem to remember Bob blowing cheese on the dance floor, though.
[46:50.15]Oh boy.
[46:50.81]What do you think about this screwdriver?
[46:59.53]That's it.
[47:00.13]That's all I got.
[47:02.77]That's all I got, Trevor.
[47:11.78]Well, should I sit back down at the computer?
[47:17.68]I guess I could talk to you.
[47:18.70]Do I have to show everybody, like, fucking photos?
[47:21.84]Oh, God, come on.
[47:25.18]I don't want to show everybody my pictures.
[47:27.04]Thanks for the postcard.
[47:35.77]Curtis, I didn't send you this.
[47:38.29]I've never seen it before.
[47:39.05]The reveal.
[47:39.59]The great reveal.
[47:40.73]Oh.

[55:41.52]By the way, other employees can see inside your thoughts.
[55:44.28]I'm getting really lewd lately.
[55:48.62]I can't help it.
[55:49.30]We're playing lewd games.
[55:51.21]I can't help it.
[55:52.13]I'm trying to keep as P-lewd G13 as I can.
[55:56.23]What am I supposed to fucking do in this game?
[56:06.21]Hey Trevor, this time, Darth Vader yelled at me and grabbed me and did this fucking force choke on me.
[56:11.99]He called my mother crazy.
[56:14.33]Curtis, what's wrong?
[56:17.60]There's something wrong with me.
[56:19.42]God, I'm seeing things.
[56:20.88]It'll be okay.
[56:24.98]Look, let's get out of here for a few, huh?
[56:28.02]I'll send mail to Tom.
[56:29.32]He won't mind, okay?
[56:31.20]Finally, we've escaped the office.
[56:41.48]Okay.
[56:41.68]I'm gonna be one of those annoying guys at dinner that like shows the waiter the pictures of your family and stuff.
[56:54.25]Oh, well, yeah, we just, there's a new baby in the family.
[56:57.01]Yeah, come on, take a look.
[56:58.69]Here's the photo.
[56:59.71]Oh, wow, she's beautiful.
[57:01.87]Yeah, she is.
[57:02.55]Yep, she sure is.
[57:03.49]You know, he's just doing that so he'll get a fucking better tip from you.
[57:07.80]The waiter doesn't actually give a shit about like your family photos.
[57:11.39]He's like, oh, if I play along, these motherfuckers will give me like an extra eight bucks on their like $12 bill.
[57:17.24]$20 bill, whatever it is.
[57:25.60]Now, wait a minute.
[57:26.16]This is going to get awkward.
[57:27.46]I don't think, I ain't picking up the check.
[57:29.26]So I'm going to put that away.
[57:34.44]Alright, bud.
[57:36.06]I've got you trapped.
[57:37.90]What?
[57:38.14]Oh, okay.
[57:42.39]That was a little creepy.
[57:43.97]That's wording, man.
[57:45.77]That's not how you open.
[57:53.54]Well, we're sitting here awkwardly.
[57:54.94]By the way, I just want to make sure I let you know.
[57:57.02]You're trapped.
[57:59.32]For a guy that's having a lot of issues internally right now, you don't say that.
[58:05.51]Well, well, well.
[58:06.73]The boys are playing hooky.
[58:08.57]Shame on you.
[58:10.11]Shame isn't part of my vocabulary.
[58:13.01]Well, it must be.
[58:13.87]You just said it.
[58:14.89]See what happens when you waste a good line on a straight boy.
[58:19.91]Did he say streaming?
[58:27.27]What's the purpose of doing this?
[58:34.48]I'm trying to hear what the audio in the background is saying.
[58:37.96]I think I got my Sonic hearing.
[58:46.13]We need big hips.
[58:55.19]Okay.
[58:57.59]Curtis, for God's sake, I'm your best friend.
[58:59.44]You know you can talk to me, don't you?
[59:01.06]I know, I...
[59:05.88]You remember how I told you about my mother going crazy and leaving my father and I alone?
[59:12.00]Yeah.
[59:13.34]It's not true.
[59:13.90]Uh-oh.
[59:16.04]I mean, I thought it was, but until a few days ago, I remembered that she hung herself from her ceiling fan.
[59:27.13]Jesus, man.
[59:27.95]That guy in the background heard that.
[59:29.45]It's harsh.
[59:31.11]That's not something you want to hear as a fucking waiter.
[59:32.47]I wonder if he was so flipped out.
[59:40.72]I'd rather just keep going.
[59:42.48]Don't take this personally, okay?
[59:44.20]But have you thought about talking to someone?
[59:47.60]I mean, all that stuff about your mother, that's an awful lot for you to deal with alone.
[59:52.10]Yeah, I've thought about it, Trev, but... Look, I'd rather be dead.
[59:57.07]I'd rather be dead than have to go back there.
[59:58.63]Hey, nobody's talking about sending you back.
[60:00.47]I'm just talking about counseling, okay?
[60:05.85]Yeah, okay, I'll think about it.
[60:07.01]I...
[60:09.01]Really good background acting there.
[60:10.07]You're the only one I've told about this so far.
[60:12.05]I'm not even kidding.
[60:14.47]You're not going to tell anyone, are you?
[60:18.27]Of course not, fool.
[60:19.21]Are you kidding?
[60:22.23]My own therapist has made me so close to perfect.
[60:25.21]I never tell secrets.
[60:26.91]I never tell lies.
[60:28.53]Hell, I don't even crap anymore.
[60:29.93]I just excrete rose petals from my belly button.
[60:33.48]Good luck, I guess.
[60:35.30]I got a ton of stuff I got to do at work.
[60:37.16]If I have enough energy, I'm going to go slog through it right now.
[60:39.92]Well, me too, come to think about it.
[60:41.85]Waiters.
[60:42.87]What do you say?
[60:43.61]Waiters don't have those towels.
[60:44.63]Let's get the hell out of Dodge.
[60:46.01]Let's go, Miss Kitty.
[60:53.75]There's always a waiter in every TV show or movie you ever watch while I look for it.
[60:57.69]The waiter has a little towel that he, like, spins, spins, spins, throws over the shoulder.
[61:01.26]In every single... I'm not even kidding.
[61:03.20]Every single one.
[61:04.92]I've never seen that towel before.
[61:06.58]I don't know what it is.
[61:08.46]But watch.
[61:08.92]It's one, two, three, over the shoulder.
[61:15.59]We didn't order anything.
[61:16.35]We just sat down and talked and left.
[61:17.63]We didn't even order a drink.
[61:20.79]No water.
[61:22.47]That waiter is pissed.
[61:23.55]He, like, came over and talked to us for a second.
[61:37.90]Nice joke.
[61:38.44]That wasn't a joke.
[61:40.68]I'm just making an observation.
[61:41.76]There's a lion at the water.
[61:44.58]Hardly.
[61:45.52]More like a wildebeest.
[61:53.33]I like you, Curtis.
[61:57.47]Alright, easy.
[61:58.79]There's more to you than meets the eye.
[62:00.47]That was close.
[62:07.75]Kind of walked around me.
[62:14.18]Alright.
[62:17.04]I guess we're going to... Can I do anything over here?
[62:19.86]I don't think so.
[62:24.11]Stick back to my computer and sit down?
[62:31.13]I don't know, I guess.
[62:35.72]Am I going to get punched in the face at my desk again?
[62:37.40]Let's see what happens.
[62:45.04]Curtis.
[62:46.36]What about my email?
[62:50.28]I have so many fucking emails now.
[62:54.06]Oh my lord.
[62:54.76]Okay.
[62:55.86]Oops.
[62:59.71]That you checked the tool documents into the wrong directory at a deadline and couldn't find them anywhere.
[63:05.75]Wake up and pay attention.
[63:06.71]Me.
[63:06.99]Me.
[63:09.87]Hello everyone.
[63:10.99]I just wanted to let you know that I'm a murderer.
[63:12.95]I killed my mother.
[63:13.89]I made her do it.
[63:15.01]She hung herself because I'm such a freak.
[63:16.61]Because I'm such a monster.
[63:18.55]You should have seen her with her eyes bulging out of her face like rotting cherries and her tongue all black and purple and fat and piss dripping down her leg under the rug.
[63:24.85]You remember, Curtis?
[63:26.36]Don't you remember?
[63:27.14]You remember, you little freak?
[63:32.04]Okay.
[63:34.24]Animal testing.
[63:35.82]Dear depression.
[63:36.98]Jesus.
[63:38.97]To all.
[63:40.19]To all from Curtis.
[63:46.50]That is not something you want to send.
[63:48.72]Hold on.
[63:49.00]Are we going to get emails from this?
[63:50.60]About this?
[63:52.92]Animal rights.
[63:53.60]Animal testing.
[63:55.88]More funny replies.
[63:56.80]Let's just do another funny reply.
[64:01.08]Me and this guy have a funny relationship.
[64:03.50]We talk like shit to each other and stuff.
[64:07.76]We just write jokes back and forth.
[64:13.36]Me and Trevor type out huge... Can't you just tell it to me?
[64:19.74]This takes so long to write this all out.
[64:22.10]Come over to my cubicle and tell me this joke.
[64:29.07]From Jonas Craig.
[64:31.69]I guess this is dad.
[64:34.94]Uh, you might not recognize me at first.
[64:36.88]I've lost a lot of flesh.
[64:38.02]Look for the guy with the necklace of eyeballs and teeth.
[64:40.84]Dad.
[64:41.20]What?
[64:44.58]Hold on.
[64:45.36]You'll be attending a charming little academy in Poland.
[64:48.10]I'm sure you'll have fun there.
[64:49.08]I know you did.
[64:49.64]Don't forget to pack your VapoRub.
[64:51.12]Alright, so I'm just slowly going crazy.
[64:58.35]Thanks, Dad.
[64:59.35]Okay, sales, building renovations, career opportunities from... Dear Mr. Craig, we've been following your career for quite some time now, and we've decided to make you an offer.

[65:20.24]We believe that with a little practice you could become the world's next Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, who knows, even a Hitler or Stalin.
[65:26.90]Please send us a copy of your resume along with a dismembered human body and a quart of goat's blood.
[65:32.62]We're looking forward to working with you.
[65:34.84]Asmodeus Azorath Belial and Scratch Incorporated.
[65:42.62]Okay.
[65:45.44]We're just getting more and more of these emails from weird sources.
[65:51.60]There are no mutated salamanders.
[65:53.78]I'm just going crazy.
[65:54.74]These are all just... Where can we get a crunch bird, man?
[65:58.64]Crunch bird!

[67:12.97]I can't leave this screen.
[67:19.34]It's definitely murder.
[67:20.22]Yeah, it's murder.
[67:21.18]Come on.
[67:26.14]I was reaching too far there.

[67:35.13]Murder.
[67:37.19]Forget it, rat boy.
[67:38.33]Murder.

[68:42.13]Bob A... Murder.
[68:48.12]Password's error.
[68:48.80]Not correct.
[68:54.92]It's not blob.
[68:55.74]No, it isn't.
[68:58.06]Why does this keep opening?
[69:03.35]I wish I would play this game.
[69:04.69]I think I have to get up from the desk.
[69:14.10]Alright, Bob.
[69:15.66]6114.
[69:19.36]God damn it.
[69:24.65]Who is it?
[69:24.97]Is it Bob?
[69:26.57]Which one of these guys is Bob?
[69:35.31]I've been playing this game longer than any other game in this stream.
[69:40.33]Oh, Curtis.
[69:41.67]Why?
[69:42.01]Why all this secrecy?
[69:43.77]Are you ashamed of me or something?
[69:45.05]No, of course not.
[69:46.03]I just... I just don't want everybody to know... Oh, Bob's the asshole.
[69:49.13]Okay.
[69:50.51]I want you all to myself.
[69:53.49]Let's meet at the Dreaming Tree after work, okay?
[69:56.09]Here we go.
[69:56.63]Yeah, okay.
[69:57.51]Dreaming Tree.
[70:00.94]So the Dreaming Tree is that bar, lounge, restaurant thing.
[70:11.90]Alright, let's go talk to Bob.
[70:14.47]That's not Bob.
[70:16.23]Bob's over here.
[70:22.47]Bob.
[70:24.10]I found my document.
[70:25.68]That was pretty juvenile of you.
[70:27.24]What are you talking about, Craig?
[70:29.24]It's not my fault you can't find your files.
[70:31.22]Yeah, well, whatever.
[70:32.60]Just don't let it happen again or you'll regret it.
[70:34.40]Ooh, is that a threat?
[70:35.79]You're scaring me.
[70:39.45]So I'm going to kill Bob.
[70:46.33]This is just like passive-aggressive video game.
[70:48.71]Like, this is not... Treece?
[70:53.72]Jesus Christ.
[70:56.74]Can I ask you a question?
[70:57.55]Anything.
[71:03.59]Do you think there are things in the world beyond what we can see?
[71:11.53]What a heavy question.
[71:13.61]Yeah.
[71:17.11]I think we're surrounded by things we cannot see.
[71:20.65]Is there anything that you... Can you give me a huge rendition of what you... Hold on.
[71:27.27]My phone's blowing up right now.
[71:29.51]In the figurative sense.
[71:33.20]I didn't like that answer.
[71:36.62]Let me ask you a question.
[71:38.68]Would you be angry if I killed Bob?
[71:42.82]I mean, he's gotta go.
[71:44.76]He clearly has to go.
[71:52.01]Can't believe Bob.
[71:53.55]He's such a total jerk.
[71:54.71]Do you know what he just said to me?
[71:55.97]Uh, no, but I'm sure it was ill-mannered and lame.
[72:00.65]Don't let him get to you, bud.
[72:02.59]That's a lot.
[72:03.10]Everybody knows you're gonna get that promotion over him.
[72:05.28]Yeah, well.
[72:06.10]A lot of material.
[72:07.16]Still, think anybody would mind if I killed him?
[72:09.86]What?
[72:11.16]Nope.
[72:11.56]Be my guest.
[72:14.92]Wow.
[72:18.47]Okay, well, we got our answer there.
[72:20.79]The thing we were just saying.
[72:21.87]Alright, what about it?
[72:30.84]We've already been in here.
[72:33.86]Yeah, we know.
[72:34.96]Can we not get into these other doors?
[72:40.38]No, these doors are closed.
[72:43.48]And I can't do anything about this either.
[72:48.75]We have Trevor's permission.
[72:50.65]Yeah, we do.
[72:55.26]So, there's a little mini door in here, but I can't pry it open.
[73:03.46]And there's only another... There's only one other door here.
[73:07.94]This is the one that's... This one's locked.
[73:12.67]This one's storage.
[73:15.77]I'm gonna go... Let's go back in here.
[73:23.65]I'm intrigued.
[73:24.21]This game has me intrigued.
[73:25.35]You know what I'm saying?
[73:28.83]I want to show you the postcard.
[73:29.97]Where's this other girl?
[73:30.72]Over here, right?
[73:32.06]No, not you.
[73:34.98]Use my ID card on the mini door.
[73:42.28]No, that's Bob.
[73:43.31]She's over here.
[73:43.83]Okay, you.
[73:47.15]What do you think of this?
[73:50.79]Hey, Treece.
[73:53.01]I know you like old movie stars.
[73:54.41]Oh, let me see.
[73:56.09]Trace.
[73:58.32]Just play the game.
[74:02.32]Looks like someone's got a crush on you.
[74:04.30]Screwdriver on Bob.
[74:06.52]Would you like to know a secret?
[74:08.38]I have a crush on you.
[74:13.63]It's from me.
[74:15.67]Oh, okay.
[74:16.63]You're my secret Santa.
[74:19.23]Well, next year, Carol...
[74:21.18]Pez is not a good option, you know?
[74:23.50]It's never a good option.
[74:28.54]Come on, that was like a high quality, like, comedian joke.
[74:31.14]Right?
[74:33.37]That's like, that's what you'd expect from a comedian.
[74:35.31]And I just gave it to you.
[74:46.86]Should I go back to the computer?
[74:53.22]Sit down at the computer again.
[74:54.34]Nothing new.
[75:02.79]Tap, tap, tap.
[75:05.83]I need to... I gotta log out.
[75:15.68]We demand Trevor.
[75:16.94]Alright.
[75:18.68]Alright.
[75:21.89]Has he seen all these?
[75:22.69]He's already seen all the photos, guys.
[75:24.27]There's nothing else I can do with him.
[75:27.51]He's already seen everything.
[75:30.97]Save.
[75:31.79]Holy shit.
[75:35.14]Holy shit.
[75:37.28]Wow.
[75:41.62]Wow.
[75:44.48]Okay.
[75:46.62]That could have been real bad.
[75:57.45]So what else is there to do?
[76:01.05]Go to the boss?
[76:01.99]I can't go to the boss's room.
[76:04.14]It's blocked off.
[76:07.14]Stream saved.
[76:10.16]This guy hasn't done anything.
[76:11.06]Has he seen all my photos?
[76:12.62]I don't think I can even show it to him.
[76:19.17]Officially playing.
[76:20.21]Yeah, once I save the game, I'm officially playing it.
[76:26.01]Maybe I should go to my... Maybe I should just leave.
[76:29.39]Should I leave by the... Should I go to the house?
[76:34.74]Kill Bob.
[76:36.02]I would love to.
[76:37.02]It's something to do with that door.
[76:54.52]I can't screw Bob in the head.
[76:58.75]Can't show Bob pictures.
[77:01.05]Oh, I can.
[77:03.33]Hey, Bob.
[77:04.53]Are you taking the same date to the Christmas party this year?
[77:07.01]I figure she'll give you a discount now that she's turned 60.
[77:09.62]Kiss my ass.
[77:10.86]Ouch, what a devastatingly witty retort.
[77:18.70]I've just been walking around showing photos to people and making fun of them.
[77:23.31]I've been going around showing photos to people and making fun of them or being offended by what they say in response to the photo being shown.
[77:31.96]That's been this whole game so far.
[77:35.66]I'm the bad guy.
[77:38.02]That's just the way it is.
[77:47.56]Well...
[77:50.63]I guess I can try to go to the small door again, but I don't know what that's gonna do for me.
[77:54.44]I gotta, like, turn around.
[77:58.86]Turn around.
[78:04.80]Can I go left or right here?
[78:06.54]No, I can only go in here.
[78:12.51]Get in.
[78:14.47]Oh, God, this is new.
[78:15.33]Something changed.
[78:15.89]Alright, well, now what?
[78:18.89]Oh, hey, Therese.
[78:19.69]Oh, no.
[78:20.09]How are you?
[78:20.61]Not like a closet sex scene, please.
[78:22.99]Excuse me.
[78:25.14]You heard me.
[78:27.00]No, no closet sex.
[78:28.32]Cut the crap, Curtis.
[78:29.26]I find you very attractive.
[78:34.14]Listen, Therese, I have a girlfriend.
[78:35.60]I don't care about that.
[78:37.10]Oh, God.
[78:37.56]I don't want to be a prom date.
[78:39.59]No.
[78:41.00]I want you.
[78:42.14]I want your flesh.
[78:45.20]Don't say that.
[78:45.86]That's not what you say to somebody.
[78:47.18]And your sweat.
[78:52.38]Easy.
[78:53.08]Watch those hands.
[78:54.08]Okay.
[78:55.88]Very good.
[79:03.20]Why do I keep playing this?
[79:06.09]Because I don't know.
[79:06.89]I got sucked in.
[79:12.26]Still can't do anything over here.
[79:14.40]You would think that the screwdriver could be used on one of these mechanical devices.
[79:19.05]Can I go that way?
[79:28.36]No.
[79:31.76]The only thing to do is to move the boxes.
[79:36.08]Nothing else.
[79:37.22]Move these two.
[79:38.96]And then go look at it.
[79:44.03]You tell me this screwdriver can't... Why does this thing have a lock?
[79:50.77]This doesn't work.
[79:53.08]We already tried this.
[79:53.78]It didn't do anything.
[79:57.92]No.
[79:58.48]God damn it.
[79:59.50]Keycard.
[80:02.98]Showed a picture.
[80:09.31]Just kick the door in.
[80:11.69]I would if I could.
[80:18.30]Okay.
[80:19.84]Back to business as usual.
[80:21.34]Talking to people.
[80:27.30]This guy's got a bunch of keys.
[80:30.72]So what do I do?
[80:31.24]Pull the fire drill so this guy has to leave?
[80:32.84]Or what?
[80:39.15]What about his leave work?
[80:41.09]Is this place open?
[80:44.05]Oh.
[80:44.53]Wait a minute.
[80:53.76]Alright.
[80:55.32]How are you doing?
[80:57.14]How do you do?
[80:59.38]I'm just sitting here alone.
[81:05.04]Look at this.
[81:08.20]Emily Bront's extra thick chocolate malt.
[81:11.44]Sheridan Lafon's green tea ice cream.
[81:13.34]Coffee, tea, beers, wines.
[81:18.23]I'm not all that hungry.
[81:26.48]Here he comes.
[81:27.18]Over the right shoulder, spinning around.
[81:28.48]Didn't do it!
[81:28.90]My fucking, everything I just said is a fucking failure, it's a lie!
[81:55.94]Everything is meaningless.
[82:04.42]Wait, he doesn't want to see my bullshit?
[82:07.80]Wait.
[82:08.91]No.
[82:11.41]Should I just go home?
[82:12.57]I'm just going to go home.
[82:19.27]Is there anything happening here now that I can just leave?
[82:24.76]Screwdriver on the dresser.
[82:34.15]By the small door of beer.
[82:38.83]I can stop playing this game.
[82:39.97]That's true.
[82:40.39]I could stop playing this game.
[82:44.65]But not yet.
[82:46.75]Important.
[82:50.26]Anybody else gonna come up to me?
[82:54.96]How do I get everyone just to leave?
[82:58.54]When does work end?
[83:06.22]How do I get us to leave work?
[83:17.13]This is a one-minute joke.
[83:18.81]Well, we got sucked in.
[83:25.35]Check our emails.
[83:29.41]System... What happened?
[83:32.76]Oh, wait.
[83:32.98]I can hack other people's accounts.
[83:36.39]Oh, shit.
[83:36.91]Okay.
[83:37.03]Maybe this is what I was supposed to be doing.
[83:38.33]Alright.
[83:40.67]Trevor's password is going to be my name.
[83:42.91]I think.
[83:46.65]Fuck.
[83:50.05]Nope.
[83:55.74]It never ends.
[83:57.46]Well, I know what my password is.
[84:02.74]Emails.
[84:04.28]No, nothing new.
[84:07.25]Just saw a bunch of keys on the shelf.
[84:10.53]Yeah, the keys, I can't interact with them.
[84:15.01]Every password is blobbed.
[84:16.19]Now that would be funny.
[84:26.50]Do you send emails?
[84:31.94]I gotta like log out.
[84:36.94]Send your report?
[84:42.17]I mean, don't... How do I send the report?
[84:46.97]This is it right here.
[84:52.07]How do I email this?
[84:56.59]Maybe if I just keep clicking it over and over again.
[84:59.07]Email.
[85:04.77]Email.
[85:06.76]From?
[85:07.02]I can't, like, pick.
[85:17.98]Wait, did you guys just give me the password to the archives?
[85:24.00]Alright, let's try it.
[85:39.62]Okay.
[85:41.50]Classify, classify, classify.
[85:43.36]In this, the exciting early days of the threshold project, we are delighted to report a marked stability in the threshold pulse.
[85:48.48]Using the latest in surge suppression, we've been able to control, document, and complete searching for a remainder.
[85:56.73]Well, it doesn't really even do anything.
[86:04.91]But how do I, how do I send this?
[86:08.44]I would like to email this.
[86:09.72]I think we're stuck here.
[86:18.17]I believe we are stuck.
[86:24.27]Go tell Bob about it.
[86:25.39]Alright, Bob, what did you do?
[86:34.69]Watch the whole cut scene when he types.
[86:43.61]We looked at it before.
[86:45.93]Let's confront her.
[86:52.03]Listen, about what happened to the network over the day.
[86:55.64]I really like you a lot, but I'm seeing somebody right now.
[86:57.94]Be quiet.
[87:00.68]Listen.
[87:04.26]Listen to the language of your flesh.
[87:07.15]Oh my god, lady.
[87:08.81]It's telling you what to do.
[87:11.25]We're in the office.
[87:12.75]This is not going to work.
[87:20.07]This lady really is creeping me out.
[87:24.76]Ow.
[87:26.00]The ringing.
[87:26.88]I've got to pee.
[87:28.74]I'm going to BRB one more time.
[87:31.64]You guys figure it out.
[87:32.88]I'm going to be thinking too.
[87:34.22]I'm going to pee and I'll be right back.
[87:35.34]Time to pee.
[87:37.88]See you in a minute.
[88:09.93]Thank you.
[88:51.26]Thank you.
[89:57.63]Alright, so do we figure it out?
[90:15.89]Okay, we're back.
[90:24.86]Alright.
[90:27.15]Move on.
[90:27.83]Moving on.
[90:33.85]Let's go on the computer.
[90:37.82]Computer time.
[90:39.62]Okay.
[90:47.92]I'm watching the whole cutscene.
[90:51.66]That's the whole cutscene.
[91:00.68]This is not Harvester.
[91:01.82]This is Phantasmagoria 2.
[91:08.74]Bob A. Alright, hold on.
[91:11.72]I like these flash.
[91:12.94]What does it say?
[91:17.77]The other one.
[91:24.85]What am I supposed to be clicking?
[91:25.95]I have to access the Venom.
[91:27.79]Isn't that what I have?
[91:29.37]Isn't this it?
[91:34.14]You idiot, you have to use the granola bar to lure Bob from under the couch.
[91:58.35]Wait, what did that just say?
[91:59.67]Fuck, I was too busy laughing.
[92:03.05]Oh my god.
[92:07.64]Oh, God damn it.
[92:09.08]I'm only going to look at the fucking subsystems.
[92:16.81]Heathcliff?
[92:17.79]Heathcomb?
[92:19.35]What did that just say?
[92:25.31]Heat something.
[92:32.99]Bob A. Heat.
[92:35.29]Heat tech.
[92:38.94]Alright, let's go.
[92:40.16]Let's get some of these passwords.
[92:47.61]Click on the... Access the Venoman document.
[92:51.11]Click on the document in the left window.
[92:55.94]The Venoman document.
[92:58.54]If this is right.
[93:01.62]Venoman document.
[93:02.68]Click on... The document in the left window.
[93:20.68]Vitamin?
[93:21.38]Vitamin?
[93:22.52]Alright, what was his... Let's log into his shit.
[93:33.71]Okay.
[93:35.17]Where is he?
[93:40.36]That password's not correct.
[93:44.32]Alright, I think we're gonna move on.
[93:46.54]We've been here long enough.
[93:50.96]Courtesy Venoman.
[93:52.34]Click on the left screen on the document.
[93:55.02]Isn't that what I've been doing?
[94:03.34]Okay, yeah, so I'm clicking on the left screen.
[94:10.37]That's it.
[94:15.47]It's not doing anything.
[94:21.41]Carve ID and password broke the game.
[94:32.22]Is this one of those like end-user license agreements where I have to be on the bottom of the page?
[94:43.77]Use a walkthrough?
[94:49.09]Walkthrough.
[94:51.74]I don't know why.
[94:52.24]I think I really did break the game.
[94:56.69]At least kill.
[94:57.41]We have to kill Bob.
[94:58.59]I think I have to reload the save file.
[95:01.33]This is supposed to be a cutscene.
[95:02.79]The cutscene is supposed to continue.
[95:07.94]Hold on.
[95:08.14]Let's reload the game.
[95:09.80]Maybe I fucked it up.
[95:22.62]okay let me let me just like how do I kill Bob at load game wow no this is I want to load load game wow load okay let's sit back down okay let's click on the screen so you're telling me that like the next step of this game is a cutscene is supposed to play

[95:57.35]There it is.
[95:58.37]Bingo.
[96:03.19]Uh, no.
[96:04.65]Oh, well.
[96:07.27]There it is again.
[96:07.75]I didn't even see it.
[96:13.60]Blood is sweet.
[96:14.30]Okay, blood is sweet.
[96:26.35]I can't interact with anything over here.
[96:30.42]Did that say, take a break?
[96:33.76]I think that just said, hey, take a break.
[96:37.18]Alright, let me see something.

[96:38.24]I don't think that's his password, though.
[96:44.50]Give me a second.
[96:45.74]We're going to skip this part of the game.
[96:50.95]Hold on.
[96:57.13]Game's too difficult.
[97:02.41]I just think I screwed something up.
[97:03.95]Alright, hold on a second.

[98:09.80]So, like, this should be it.
[98:12.00]I don't understand.
[98:16.09]Just drink all the fucking water from the water cooler and leave and quit.
[98:23.55]Okay.
[98:24.91]Well.
[98:26.59]This is awkward.

[99:44.43]Did I not reply like a snarky response?
[99:47.00]Okay, sorry.
[99:47.64]Sarcastic.
[99:48.74]I don't care.
[99:49.86]Happy joy joy.
[99:50.54]I don't even know.
[99:54.96]I'm doing random replies.
[99:56.44]I'm just doing the thing that Bruce Almighty does.
[99:59.33]It's hard to be God.
[100:07.19]Alright.
[100:08.10]That's it, that's it.
[100:09.00]We're done.
[100:09.90]Back here.
[100:11.56]Click it.
[100:12.24]Do it.
[100:15.18]Fuck.
[100:15.88]Alright, I gotta talk to Teresa.
[100:19.28]Just, will somebody's eyes bulge out of their fucking skull?
[100:21.98]Teresa?
[100:28.27]Yeah, it was awkward.
[100:30.66]I didn't miss an email.
[100:32.34]I did not miss one email.
[100:37.51]I just want the game to progress.
[100:39.71]It's the wrong document.
[100:45.75]There's only... Other document?
[100:54.45]There is no other document.
[100:56.84]There's these documents.
[100:58.36]Here it is.
[100:59.02]Access.
[100:59.96]I can't access it.
[101:02.92]There's no accessing this one.
[101:07.11]This is the one that can be accessed.
[101:10.29]Alright, here we go.
[101:10.79]Go.
[101:13.05]Finish the document.
[101:43.45]Restart from step one.
[101:44.73]I just wanted to see somebody's fucking head explode.
[101:49.19]This guy has not had any information.
[101:52.47]Trevor has nothing.
[101:55.61]She has nothing.
[101:56.87]We've exhausted all of our options.
[102:04.04]Let's go mash our fingers into Trevor's... I can't do anything to Bob.
[102:12.93]Don't give up.
[102:13.69]Don't give up.
[102:15.17]Stab Bob with a picture.
[102:20.98]There is a walkthrough.
[102:21.76]I just looked at it.
[102:22.82]I just tried to look at it.
[102:23.82]And the thing in the walkthrough didn't work.
[102:27.98]There was no... It did not do anything.
[102:31.00]There's something very specific that I'm not seeing or not doing.
[102:37.92]I might just have to open up a YouTube video of Bob's head being crushed.
[102:49.51]Because I've almost exhausted every option.
[102:56.00]The small door, that's what I thought too, but I don't have anything to... I don't have anything to open it with.
[103:04.21]Um... Alright, I think we're going to get out of here.
[103:10.13]I've got to read the rest.
[103:15.36]Hold on.
[103:15.70]Wait, wait, wait.
[103:18.71]I called everybody.
[103:22.75]Let me just look at this.
[103:28.21]Photos.
[103:31.60]Use the card key on Trevor.
[103:36.00]Use the card key on Trevor is something apparently I didn't do.
[103:38.90]Why would I want to use the card key on him?
[103:50.28]Oh my fucking god.
[103:51.44]This is oddly specific.
[103:56.45]That's it.
[103:57.91]That's what I had to do.
[103:58.49]I had to get that.
[104:19.57]I had to get him to say that.
[104:24.20]Don't even tell me that's what we had to do.
[104:27.16]You're talking about A to B, C to D, D to F. Unbelievable.
[104:35.06]Unbelievable.
[104:35.82]Un-fucking-believable.
[104:37.70]Time to get out of here.
[104:50.96]Okay.
[104:53.24]Time to get out of here.
[104:58.00]You have to exhaust every single option.
[105:00.29]Now, just on principle.
[105:02.29]On principle, I'm not leaving the game.
[105:07.57]Time to get out of here.
[105:09.81]Dreaming Tree.
[105:13.10]Here we go.
[105:15.04]Wow.
[105:17.84]Show the card to the IT guy was obvious.
[105:22.17]What?
[105:22.29]Why would I think I had to use my accent?
[105:26.23]That's the one thing I didn't do.
[105:27.99]A jalapeno and honey grilled cheese sandwich for him and a veggie burger for her.
[105:35.19]I'm going to get a jalapeno.
[105:36.35]You're not that hungry.
[105:37.43]No, me neither.
[105:38.97]How about a couple of those double chocolate little things?
[105:44.37]This guy sucks.
[105:44.99]This waiter hates us.
[105:46.95]You're going to order food?
[105:48.23]You've been here four times.
[105:49.15]You're not going to order food?
[105:51.11]No, we're just going to get a milkshake and leave.
[105:54.07]Waiters and fucking wait staff, cooks, chefs, everybody hates these fucking people.
[106:01.89]Bad posture.
[106:04.49]Hi, sweetie.
[106:05.49]How was your day?
[106:07.11]Pretty much sucked.
[106:12.33]Curtis, I want to be there for you.
[106:15.87]I want to help you when you're feeling bad.
[106:19.80]You just mean so much to me.
[106:22.32]You're there for me, Jess.
[106:24.54]I know.
[106:25.08]It's... I just wish... I wish I could be there all the time.
[106:31.10]That's all.
[106:35.91]That was so awkward.
[106:45.11]Have you seen this photo?
[106:47.23]What about this one?
[106:48.51]How about this one?
[106:50.05]What about a screwdriver?
[106:54.39]Check, please.
[106:54.95]No, not yet.
[106:57.70]What's the matter, Jess?
[106:59.84]What's the matter?
[107:00.24]You don't like your double chocolate milkshake for a fucking 12-year-old and we're like 45?
[107:03.66]I know when we started seeing each other, we said it was just for fun.
[107:08.90]No commitments.
[107:10.76]And I meant it, too.
[107:11.84]I really did.
[107:12.68]I just... Sometimes things change.
[107:18.98]I love you, Curtis.
[107:20.50]Oh, God.
[107:21.66]I'm not trying to smother you or anything.
[107:23.54]I just want to be with you.
[107:24.82]I just... It's foreshadowing.
[107:26.26]I'm gonna get smothered.
[107:27.94]I just want to be with you.
[107:43.24]That's so... He just, like, slapped it onto our hands.
[107:46.48]That was fucking rude.
[107:49.98]Yeah, just like, take this and shut the fuck up.
[107:52.40]Thanks for coming in here and fucking ordering two drinks, you two fucking shitheads.
[108:00.37]That's a bad waiter.
[108:01.39]I've told you.
[108:04.99]I guess it's time to get the... Aw, look at the two little lovebirds.
[108:09.91]Aren't they cute?
[108:11.57]Keep your voice down.
[108:13.28]What for?
[108:15.31]Why are you always trying to hide this gorgeous lady, Curtis?
[108:18.37]I mean, if I was you, I'd follow her around with a spotlight.
[108:22.17]What does that mean?
[108:26.72]Follow you around with a spotlight?
[108:33.62]Jess, do you remember that night we went to the park?
[108:37.24]Oh God, it was so hot.
[108:39.42]We brought a loaf of stale bread to give to the ducks.
[108:43.21]And they all came.
[108:45.81]I never knew there could be so many ducks in one pond.
[108:49.54]And you, you ran from them.
[108:51.98]Oh, they were going to eat me.
[108:55.63]You remember what happened when we got rid of him?
[109:00.27]Of course I do.
[109:01.73]Yeah, I've been there with phrasing.
[109:03.35]Speaking of eating.
[109:04.31]Oh my lord.
[109:06.35]It was so hot.
[109:07.25]Your skin was so slippery.
[109:10.41]Why is everybody so gross in this game?
[109:12.05]Dark spot underneath that tree.
[109:15.17]You had to stop moving anytime anybody came close.
[109:19.03]And you, you made those...
[109:22.05]Sounds those sexy whimpers as you couldn't God stand it.
[109:31.96]What am I seeing?
[109:34.76]Hallucinating.
[109:35.44]Kill that slut.
[109:37.78]Kill him like you killed your mother.
[109:40.46]That was me.
[109:50.70]Oh, well, sorry.
[109:52.92]Had a little bit of an attack there.
[109:57.73]So, um... Curtis, are you alright?
[109:59.03]Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry, Jess, I'm not... I'm not feeling very well right now.
[110:11.52]Oh, baby.
[110:12.50]It might be diarrhea.
[110:13.34]Do you want me to come over tonight?
[110:15.28]It'll make you feel better.
[110:16.24]Uh-oh, if you come over, you're dead.
[110:18.60]Yeah, that sounds nice.
[110:21.57]Let's get out of here, okay?
[110:23.89]God, here it comes.
[110:24.55]No, I put the wallet down.
[110:34.84]On my Kino card.
[110:35.96]Do I have no money in there?
[110:42.88]Good luck, Curtis.
[110:45.38]If you ever have any more troubles, call this lady.
[110:50.00]She's one of the best.
[110:51.94]It's a four digit number.
[111:07.30]Did he just put on three dollars?
[111:09.97]Actually, clean the apartment for a change.
[111:12.61]That was... That was not a lot of money.
[111:23.16]And we got this far for me to get banned from Twitch.
[111:26.78]We spent like two hours in this game for me to just lose my Twitch account.
[111:35.09]I'm ready.
[111:35.67]I'm ready for the censor.
[111:36.47]I'm ready to do it.
[111:41.55]What?
[111:42.15]What happened?
[111:43.57]Hey.
[111:44.05]Hey!
[111:46.23]What's going on?
[111:55.62]What?
[112:05.97]Awkward.
[112:08.39]Fuck.
[112:09.13]What are you thinking about?
[112:11.68]murder yes I just heard the music oh god don't do it I get it it's the wrong one
[112:43.13]Oh, I just saved myself some trouble there.
[112:47.37]It's actually... They're just wrestling.
[113:09.80]That's all you guys need to know.
[113:12.13]It's just a little bit of a wrestle there.
[113:13.71]Somebody's getting in trouble.
[113:15.54]They're practicing some moves.
[113:18.80]I'll narrate it to you.
[113:22.04]She just went and she grabbed the balloon from over on the... She grabbed the balloon and she's currently blowing up a balloon for making an animal.
[113:30.63]You can show it to somebody.
[113:31.63]Look at me like a fucking dog.
[113:34.47]It's still going.
[113:35.07]Hold on.
[113:43.74]That's so fucking funny, man.
[113:45.30]Like, all this shit.
[113:47.42]And this is like... This would get me in trouble if you could hear this.
[113:52.06]Okay, in fact, I gotta move my headphones.
[113:54.74]Because this is, like... This is loud.
[113:59.16]And, like, I hope you can't hear that.
[114:03.64]Okay, I think we're safe.
[114:08.00]No, we're not.
[114:08.58]Fuck.
[114:09.48]We're not safe yet.
[114:13.60]Oh, God, wait, hold on.
[114:16.95]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[114:22.41]That was fucking disgusting.
[114:24.13]That was absolutely disgusting.
[114:26.11]I think we're good.
[114:28.41]He just had a bad dream.
[114:40.13]Okay, that was... Glad I spent like fucking three hours playing this game to get to the actual naked people.
[114:51.18]Is it Bob?
[114:51.74]What's going on with the... What's going on with the camera here?
[114:54.96]Say goodbye to your hard drive, asshole.
[115:05.44]He deleted my hard drive.
[115:12.68]Tell us what happened.
[115:13.42]Okay, I can tell you.
[115:15.46]Unbelievable.
[115:16.08]I can't fucking believe this shit, man.
[115:22.45]I knew it was gonna happen, too.
[115:24.99]It was legit.
[115:28.55]It was legitimately two people having sex.
[115:32.70]And naked and nudity and shit.
[115:34.88]Good thing I got a fast finger here.
[115:37.20]Good thing.
[115:42.42]You gotta explain it.
[115:45.86]I love how, by the way, let me just make this really clear.
[115:48.48]Right before that happened, I looked over in the chat, and like two or three people said, there's no, like, sex or anything in this game, dude.
[115:55.05]Don't worry about it.
[115:55.77]There's no, like, nudity.
[115:56.69]Don't worry.
[115:57.93]Like, less than three seconds later, full-on sex scene.
[116:03.85]Unbelievable.
[116:07.60]Fuck me.
[116:09.64]Aye, aye, aye.
[116:10.22]Let's keep going.
[116:11.35]I gotta make sure this is in the right spot, though.
[116:13.57]And like, that's not the ga- we have to go back to the regular game.
[116:15.73]We have to go back to the fucking regular ass game.
[116:27.26]Give us the deets.
[116:28.06]No, I don't kiss and tell, guys.
[116:31.92]Back to work.
[116:37.40]Thanks for your cooperation, folks.
[116:39.06]I know this hasn't been easy.
[116:40.82]Detective Powell will contact you if we have any more questions.
[116:43.82]What happened?
[116:46.32]What was that horrible noise at the end?
[116:47.73]He, like, reached into her stomach and, like, pulled out goo and... No, I'm not even gonna say it.
[116:55.17]So, what happened?
[116:56.23]Bob's dead.
[117:00.54]God, what happened?
[117:02.00]Nudity's fine if the game isn't banned on Twitch.
[117:04.38]I know, but I'm just... I'm fucking around, mostly.
[117:12.56]Hard drive funeral.
[117:16.24]Yeah, I had like 9,700 pictures on there.
[117:21.50]Gary's wedding was on there.
[117:23.28]Those were Polaroids.
[117:25.33]What the hell happened?
[117:27.29]Oh, Curtis.
[117:30.81]I got here early and I went into your cube to see if you were in yet.
[117:35.29]And Bob... Bob was there.
[117:44.81]That was like he ate a hot pepper before talking to me.
[117:48.57]That wasn't sad.
[117:49.25]That wasn't scared.
[117:49.99]I am dealing with capsaicin right now, and it hurts.
[117:56.04]We're gonna walk in there.
[118:08.07]Finally, this is what I wanted.
[118:09.61]I wanted to see a smashed head.
[118:12.35]This is an active crime scene, sir.
[118:13.53]I would have to ask you to stay out of the area.
[118:15.11]No, I want to see the guy smashed in head.
[118:16.65]Oh, come on.
[118:23.51]Yes, we did.
[118:23.93]Uh-huh.
[118:29.70]Bogus.
[118:30.12]Yeah.
[118:32.62]I'm not sure.
[118:34.72]That's been taken care of.
[118:38.04]Yes.
[118:40.08]What's the deal with Bob?
[118:41.86]I doubt it, sir.
[118:45.27]Well, that's obviously... Infection.
[118:47.29]Revelation.
[118:48.15]Desecration.
[118:49.85]Infection.
[118:50.61]Revelation.
[118:51.49]Desecration.
[118:58.09]So those are the secret passwords.
[118:59.63]Okay, nothing else I can do in here, right?
[119:04.44]Should I show this guy my family's photos?
[119:09.31]Okay, that's good.
[119:10.55]Infection.
[119:11.33]Desecration.
[119:12.83]Evisceration.
[119:13.55]What was it?
[119:15.47]Infection.
[119:19.15]Infection.
[119:20.91]Desecration.
[119:22.49]Mortadella.
[119:23.91]Mortadella.
[119:28.54]Wait, now I can go in?
[119:32.98]Do you get flashlights in there?
[119:35.00]No!
[119:38.34]flashlights in the middle of the day.
[119:40.38]There are a lot of cops here.
[119:52.64]Oh, staple gun!
[120:02.47]I got him with the staple gun, and then I cut open his stomach.
[120:07.95]Like a Dilbert pencil.
[120:10.75]Hey!
[120:12.30]In case you didn't notice, this is an active crime scene.
[120:15.60]Back off.
[120:21.84]What?
[120:22.38]What's your name, sir?
[120:22.96]I don't understand this.
[120:23.78]Is this a period piece?
[120:27.00]Why is that guy from the 30s?
[120:29.68]With an old bald photographer.
[120:31.48]What?
[120:33.94]Detective Allie Powell.
[120:35.11]No nudity, but I showed this.
[120:40.42]That was, that was like, you could see that on like fucking CSI.
[120:44.85]That was network TV violence.
[120:46.95]Okay.
[120:47.79]What was your relationship to the deceased man, Bob Arnold?
[120:52.07]He was just my coworker.
[120:53.93]Did you like Bob Arnold?
[120:56.87]No.
[120:57.65]No.
[120:58.39]Yeah.
[120:59.67]My body language is saying that I'm really concerned.
[121:03.31]Is that him moving?
[121:05.25]He's like sliding away himself.
[121:07.47]Wait.
[121:07.85]Who are you?
[121:18.28]Split personality disorder, I kill people when I eat them What's in this one?
[121:34.47]What's in door number two?
[121:40.07]That is fairly distracting, I'm not gonna lie.
[121:46.39]Oh, please stop it.
[121:49.97]You're obviously overwrought, Mr. Craig.
[121:52.41]We'll continue this another time.
[121:53.92]She didn't even ask a question.
[121:59.02]That guy was just doing the thing when you're on your phone and your friend is desperately trying to ruin the conversation.
[122:05.62]Impromptu meeting at the Dreaming Tree.
[122:08.35]I think we all need to get out of here for a while.
[122:12.45]Yeah, okay.
[122:14.57]As equally your friends like fucking making a bunch of faces and like grabbing you and grabbing your hands and like, like pushing your like face and shit while you're on the phone with like the doctor.
[122:22.68]And you're like, you, you, you pull the phone and be like, dude, shut the fuck up.
[122:26.78]My mom's on the fucking phone, you idiot.
[122:32.70]Well, I hate when my fucking friends do that.
[122:34.26]You know, when you have friends.
[122:37.64]Thanks for coming, everybody.
[122:38.72]A really tragic thing happened today.
[122:43.56]Tragic and horrible.
[122:45.75]This guy's a priest.
[122:46.87]Like, sit down.
[122:47.83]If anybody should want to talk to a grief counselor, the company will make one available to you.
[122:55.07]I don't know what else to say, guys.
[122:58.29]I'll go get some drinks.
[123:02.59]Oh, wow.
[123:03.05]This is so tragic.
[123:05.59]I can't believe it.
[123:10.45]Wait, where's the boss?
[123:15.99]Smoking indoors, by the way.
[123:17.58]It's clearly in the 90s.
[123:21.06]I think he did it.
[123:22.46]You know, usually you'd be that nervous.
[123:26.44]We're all fine.
[123:27.12]He's not handling it well.
[123:28.70]I think he might be the killer.
[123:30.62]Oh, shit.
[123:37.43]no one deserved that no one oh I don't know sorry about that what about Charles manson I mean if it was good enough for Bob it's certainly good enough for jolly charlie holy I got real dark there you really held it together when you saw Bob splattered all over your cubicle cool as a cucumber
[124:02.98]Yeah, my head was in a really weird place.
[124:04.56]Okay, so are we about done with this game?
[124:05.82]I felt removed, like... Like it wasn't really real.
[124:13.93]Somebody in the chat's just like, you know, alright, I'll be like, we're done with this, right?
[124:17.53]Are you alright, Curtis?
[124:22.15]You're acting really weird.
[124:23.31]Oh, jeez, I'm sorry, Josh.
[124:25.05]We did see Bob die.
[124:26.02]I guess finding disemboweled dead guys in my cubicle just throws me right the fuck off.
[124:31.10]Fine.
[124:32.63]Why don't you call me when you're done being an asshole?
[124:39.33]I'm not playing.
[124:40.43]I've not played it yet.
[124:41.97]Now there's two.
[124:43.43]You know, I don't really feel bad for Bob.
[124:45.81]I think the bad karma fairy got him.
[124:48.55]That guy's going to come back with like five drinks, you know.
[124:51.98]She sounds like one dangerous bitch.
[124:54.32]Yep.
[124:55.52]She stomped on his head with her wicked six-inch heels.
[124:58.26]How angry would you be?
[125:00.86]That dude's going to come back with five drinks and he's paid for them.
[125:05.30]Where the fuck did they go?
[125:07.40]That's bullshit.
[125:08.46]If I'm in this friend circle, they're going to hear about it.
[125:09.96]I'm going to text those people and be like, hey, you owe me two fucking drinks.
[125:16.10]Curtis, let's cut to the chase.
[125:18.60]I've told you how I feel about you and you've put up your nice guy protest.
[125:22.77]I can't place her accent, by the way.
[125:24.11]Meet me at the Borderline tonight.
[125:26.27]Borderline?
[125:26.83]What, the club?
[125:27.41]Never been there.
[125:33.38]Here's the address.
[125:34.18]Now we get to go clubbing.
[125:38.05]I'll be there at 7.
[125:40.11]Don't disappoint me.
[125:42.15]It's real early.
[125:45.51]7 o'clock club.
[125:50.88]Where'd everybody go?
[125:55.94]He actually did come back.
[125:57.92]With a bunch of shit.
[125:59.50]And then I left too.
[126:03.10]I got up and left too.
[126:04.10]That guy ordered five drinks and everybody left and he has to sit there with- oh wow that's fucking hilarious.
[126:18.43]It's gonna take that guy like fucking three hours to drink all those.
[126:23.05]Those were heavy looking beers too.
[126:24.89]You don't just dry out- you don't just drain those.
[126:28.04]You have to sip those for like 20 minutes.
[126:33.12]Okay.
[126:34.48]Let's go talk to our rat.
[126:36.62]Uh-oh, my internet's dying again.
[126:38.06]Hey, rat girl.
[126:40.60]I don't suppose you know what the hell's going on, huh?
[126:43.20]Isn't it obvious?
[126:44.78]You're a psycho killer.
[126:53.67]This game just started to get good.
[126:57.41]Isn't it obvious?
[126:59.81]You're a psycho killer.
[127:02.97]So now it's time to leave, right?
[127:05.51]We go to the club borderline.
[127:08.71]I better hold off.
[127:09.23]I still have things to do.
[127:11.65]Like what?
[127:18.99]Caught dead.
[127:21.43]Leech therapy.
[127:23.95]Huh?
[127:24.13]Lobotomy is the answer.
[127:25.28]What the hell?
[127:26.72]I've read these books twice.
[127:29.34]Oh, fuck this.
[127:31.30]This got loud.
[127:35.98]Okay.
[127:37.92]Apparently didn't read them all.
[127:43.23]Should I go like lie down?
[127:45.07]Yeah, make sure I save it.
[127:51.90]Thank you.
[127:52.62]Save game.
[127:56.49]So time for bed.
[127:58.19]I'm gonna look in the mirror and the pus is gonna come out of my mouth and shit.
[128:01.15]It's gonna be like poltergeist.
[128:03.29]I didn't kill anyone.
[128:04.85]Of course you did!
[128:17.08]I do like the random spouts of Darth Vader yelling at me.
[128:20.20]It's perfect.
[128:20.72]That's like all I can think of.
[128:27.25]And I actually am surprised that we've been in this game for this long.
[128:29.40]But I'm okay with it.
[128:30.48]I'm actually having a pretty good time.
[128:36.84]I'm actually having a pretty good time.
[128:42.47]No, no more condom.
[128:45.41]I can never have sexual relations ever again.
[128:48.69]So that means there's no more nudity in the game.
[128:56.13]I'm not actually playing.
[128:57.65]Look, plans change, you know?
[129:07.36]Am I gonna be in?
[129:11.00]Where am I?
[129:11.60]Oh, okay.
[129:12.36]Is it time to go here now?
[129:13.14]Still have things to do.
[129:15.92]Should I go back to work and look around?
[129:17.44]Alright, this is my opportunity here.
[129:21.07]Now I can really look around.
[129:25.80]What do you think you're doing here?
[129:27.82]I just came to pick up some work to take home.
[129:30.62]Are you out of your mind?
[129:32.10]You can't take anything from a crime scene.
[129:34.57]Get out of here!
[129:37.65]To be fair, this is like the third or fourth time I've tried to enter the crime scene.
[129:43.07]At this point, I'm a suspect.
[129:45.67]You would grab this guy and throw him in the back of a car and be like, dude, this guy's come back fucking like four times to the crime scene.
[129:54.68]Why are you telling me this now?
[129:56.60]You were supposed to have those requisitions months ago.
[129:59.72]Yes.
[130:01.38]No?
[130:02.64]Alright.
[130:04.57]Can't go in there.
[130:06.73]Is this like shut off yet?
[130:07.67]Did I get security clearance?
[130:14.32]No.
[130:23.71]I cannot even go in here anymore.
[130:30.57]I still have things to do.
[130:33.81]Should I go back and drink with this guy?
[130:36.85]No.
[130:39.25]Hey, my man!
[130:40.23]Nerdist!
[130:40.95]Aren't you supposed to be basking in the warm, fluorescent lights of Wintec?
[130:44.71]Nope.
[130:45.99]School got called due to murder.
[130:47.73]I think my dog's trying to come in.
[130:49.14]Bob Marvel got himself butchered like a pig.
[130:51.18]In my cubicle, no less.
[130:52.54]No way.
[130:54.49]That is harsh, man.
[130:59.57]So, was Bob totally messed up, or what?
[131:04.33]Was he, like, knifed?
[131:05.67]Exacto knifed and stapled, among other things.
[131:09.21]Stapled?
[131:10.61]Holy shit.
[131:12.18]He must have really pissed somebody off in shipping.
[131:14.62]Oh, man.
[131:16.50]What'd I miss?
[131:19.40]Show dog.
[131:19.92]I can't.
[131:20.30]He's gone.
[131:22.06]Any information here that I needed?
[131:26.14]Or are we going to collectively over the course of the whole entire game get this waiter $3 over like four days?
[131:31.72]There's got to be something else I can do.
[131:40.31]At this point.
[131:42.03]What the fuck can I even do here?
[131:49.47]What is this number?
[131:51.99]Dr. Ricky Harburg.
[131:53.50]Psychiatrist.
[131:54.20]I can't even see the number.
[131:58.60]Just keep going back in and trying to get arrested.
[132:00.20]It'll probably happen.
[132:05.66]Call the therapist.
[132:06.51]Well, I don't have a phone.
[132:13.11]You sure I can't come in here?
[132:20.26]I'm in here again.
[132:21.54]Like... Holy shit.
[132:25.06]Okay, hold on.
[132:25.64]I got his phone.
[132:28.35]Keys?
[132:29.83]No.
[132:30.43]I can touch his phone.
[132:40.80]Okay.
[132:42.98]Shit.
[132:43.46]I don't... No, I'm trying to use this to... What am I... Oh, goddammit.
[132:52.53]I'm trying to, like, use this...
[132:57.72]I'm gonna call the boss's phone Okay, so now I'm gonna go rifle through his shit
[133:28.40]Highly illegal.
[133:30.44]Alright, now we get to go in here and we get to go through all of his stuff.
[133:32.94]Perfect.
[133:38.16]Easy.
[133:38.40]Alright, he's not here.
[133:43.00]Okay, let's go... No, don't pick up his stupid picture.
[133:50.84]No, I did this before in a...
[133:53.14]The one thing I'm able to do is... Alright, well, I have ample time and I picked up a picture.
[133:58.96]I want to, like, get a key.
[133:59.82]I need his key card.
[134:00.45]Okay, what do we got?
[134:01.31]Picture, his computer...
[134:23.51]I have access to his computer.
[134:26.21]Here we go.
[134:28.70]I can't get off this.
[134:29.50]Good.
[134:32.36]What's with the cursor?
[134:35.62]Potential earning profit threshold project.
[134:37.76]What's going on with my cursor here?
[134:43.57]I can't click anything.
[134:47.57]Interdimensionality.
[134:51.09]Good news, our external sources tell us that WinTech is indeed the only company currently researching interdimensionality.
[134:59.43]I think Rick and Morty already did that.
[135:02.05]Rick.
[135:04.20]Rick did it already.
[135:06.50]That's potential for earning profit.
[135:08.78]The Threshold project is still ramping to almost 30 years of hiatus.
[135:12.68]Sure thing.
[135:15.30]Uninstall all the Steam games.
[135:19.20]Okay, uh...
[135:22.17]What else you got here?
[135:23.33]What is that?
[135:23.87]Carpe diem.
[135:26.45]Seize the day.
[135:28.71]Yeah, well.
[135:30.21]Seize this, Warner.
[135:34.05]Huh?
[135:35.10]Okay, well, there's the password.
[135:40.42]I already knew that password.
[135:49.30]Go under his desk.
[135:53.69]A gun?
[135:54.97]Gun.
[135:57.39]Uh, no.
[135:58.41]Key.
[136:00.01]Alright, he's got a Bible, a pack of cigarettes, a gun, a... one of those party... A couple of notepads.
[136:10.21]Shit.
[136:11.37]Nice joke.
[136:15.14]Well, just what would you be doing in my office?
[136:19.76]He was gonna say kill.
[136:20.78]You see that?
[136:22.14]He was going kill.
[136:23.06]Again, second time.
[136:24.08]We've been inside of our boss's office going through his fucking desk.
[136:52.53]Now we can open the mini bar.
[136:54.43]No, not yet.
[136:56.01]Let's take a look.
[136:57.01]We've got more stuff to look at.
[136:57.97]Nothing in here.
[137:03.64]Okay.
[137:06.56]What about my desk?
[137:07.66]Am I being investigated?
[137:09.04]Wait, am I being investigated?
[137:10.42]Am I being detained?
[137:13.46]Am I under investigation?
[137:15.42]Excuse me, miss.
[137:15.96]Am I under investigation?
[137:23.21]No, don't leave.
[137:23.93]I want to see Trevor's desk.
[137:27.39]For a second, I thought I was going to fake open and close the door.
[137:29.74]Okay, let's go.
[137:34.46]Yeah, you have to tell me if you're a police officer or not.
[137:38.72]Otherwise... You're fired!
[137:40.88]Okay, here we go.
[137:44.89]Key.
[137:46.19]The secret fucked up dungeon...
[137:51.84]that the boss is hiding in the John Malkovich door.
[138:08.95]We've been waiting for you, Coraline.
[138:16.02]We just have to listen to her.
[138:19.24]Mother knows best.
[138:26.16]This is it.
[138:29.41]It's a walk-in fucking room closet.
[138:40.35]What is that?
[138:40.83]A hose?
[138:42.86]A toolbox?
[138:43.50]A tool shed?
[138:48.66]What is it, is it?
[138:57.21]Is it an elevator?
[139:00.15]Get away from me, you!
[139:08.19]You what?
[139:09.23]You monster?
[139:10.05]I'm not the monster, Curtis.
[139:12.55]That would be your daddy.
[139:14.46]No!
[139:15.50]Yes.
[139:26.75]We got it.
[139:28.13]It's in a BB-8 unit.
[139:30.73]That's where it is.
[139:31.57]It's in a droid.
[139:32.25]It's in a BB unit.
[139:36.57]Well, that was fun.
[139:41.04]Hmm.
[139:42.84]There's nothing else to do in here.
[139:49.06]Well, I got the shed.
[139:49.80]I got the... I got the... I got the log.
[139:52.54]I got the fucking wooden log.
[139:54.48]I'm good.
[139:58.35]Streamers got jokes tonight.
[139:59.79]Yeah, well, I mean, come on, man.
[140:04.79]I guess I'm... What do I have to do with the shed?
[140:07.85]Why do I keep calling it a shed?
[140:10.94]Have I been smoking crack?
[140:12.90]I don't think so.
[140:18.89]quick make it look like you were never here we've been on this game for like seven hours please free us no
[140:38.65]You know, actually, speaking of like video games, I think I want to play Assassin's Creed Origins.
[140:44.30]All I saw was like open world and you get a horse.
[140:46.34]That's like all I need to know.
[140:47.62]I don't need to know anything else.
[140:49.10]Anything about the game.
[140:53.00]I got my toolbox now.
[140:54.02]Let's like fix this.
[140:56.58]I can't.
[141:00.88]We got really invested.
[141:03.08]No, no, no.
[141:03.78]It's terrible.
[141:08.57]This is going to be a short joke.
[141:09.81]Well, it ended up being a little longer than anticipated.
[141:13.14]So what do I do?
[141:13.78]Hack this thing?
[141:16.44]Wait, let me look at it.
[141:18.22]Can I open this?
[141:22.54]It doesn't do anything.
[141:24.02]I'm going to sneeze.
[141:26.18]Here it comes!
[141:27.24]Let's go back into the crime scene again and get yelled at.
[141:34.10]Oh, Mario Odyssey.
[141:37.04]I forgot about Mario.
[141:37.98]Apparently it's like one of the great... It's apparently like the best game ever made, right?
[141:40.72]Isn't that what everyone's saying?
[141:45.66]Super Mario Odyssey is like better than Ocarina of Time or something.
[141:48.84]Is that real?
[141:55.00]Can I like use the key on the toolbox?
[141:58.74]I don't think so.
[142:03.45]Trevor's desk.
[142:10.04]Nothing.
[142:14.94]Nothing.
[142:16.04]What about Bob's desk?
[142:20.90]No?
[142:21.22]Anything random stuff to investigate with Bob?
[142:26.43]No.
[142:26.85]I think it's time to go to the club.
[142:31.17]Oh, her shit is just like drained.
[142:32.97]What is that?
[142:33.33]A button?
[142:35.27]A button?
[142:37.58]Good thing I came over here, otherwise I would have missed this random button.
[142:42.46]She left.
[142:43.26]She quit.
[142:49.36]Alright, let's go.
[142:49.90]I still have things to do.
[142:53.01]Come on.
[142:56.67]It's Bob's button.
[143:02.55]I keep wanting to go over to my desk so bad.
[143:07.19]Wait, wait, hold on.
[143:08.19]I want to call my phone.
[143:11.27]Right?
[143:12.85]I can't even do it again.
[143:13.65]Alright, let's go back home.
[143:28.16]Wario or Luigi?
[143:29.44]I mean, well, Wario... Depends on what mood you're in.
[143:35.46]Are you in like a laughing mood or are you in like a companionship mood?
[143:42.20]Wario is a comedian.
[143:43.34]Luigi is a companion.
[143:44.32]That's how I see it.
[143:51.69]I can't do anything in here.
[144:04.36]What am I supposed to do here?
[144:09.76]Can I put this on the desk?
[144:12.60]Oh, alright.
[144:14.28]Okay, we're going to open up the toolbox.
[144:22.48]And... Is there actually a log in here?
[144:35.23]This is not actually a log, right?
[144:37.65]Threshold.
[144:38.03]Threshold.
[144:44.83]No, is that a log?
[144:46.17]What is this?
[144:52.05]Is this a stray jacket?
[144:54.75]No, it's a dress.
[145:05.72]What?
[145:07.54]Anything else in here?
[145:09.96]Bob.
[145:12.16]So this was Bob's box.
[145:20.88]Oh, somebody super glued it to the table.
[145:23.58]Which one of you jokesters did it?
[145:25.04]That's bizarre.
[145:31.01]The tray's bolted in.
[145:32.07]I'm gonna have to get you back on next Halloween.
[145:39.90]This looks like a job for Mr. Screwdriver.
[145:51.05]Unscrew it!
[145:52.89]Unscrew it!
[145:56.19]That's not gonna work.
[146:03.06]Um... Like, those aren't... They're bolts.
[146:11.94]So, do we just have no use for the screwdriver?
[146:15.06]It's such a... It's a useless fucking item.
[146:23.17]I want to look at it one more time.
[146:26.64]I have nothing.
[146:27.42]I can't use a button, right?
[146:28.46]This is fucking useless.
[146:33.88]Alright, let's look at some of this stuff.
[146:35.10]Just a button.
[146:36.72]What about this?
[146:39.22]This is like matted up hair.
[146:42.49]And like kitty litter.
[146:43.63]Alright.
[146:47.91]Put on the dress.
[146:48.81]I wish.
[146:52.19]I wish.
[146:56.41]in the electrical socket alright so that I've exhausted my options oh my god I still have things to do so is there a way I can open this key like wedge it in there
[147:25.52]picture?
[147:27.94]Use the rat?
[147:28.56]The rat's not going to do anything.
[147:37.39]Oh lord.
[147:38.09]Jonas, what we, I, have dreaded the most has finally happened.
[147:41.29]Not only has the military pulled their funding on the Threshold Project, but they're suggesting that there'll be an FBI investigation regarding our methods of research.
[147:49.86]I have no other option but to suspend Threshold Project indefinitely.
[147:53.68]As head of the project, I expect you to handle the situation with discretion and tact.
[147:56.92]Frankly, Jonas, I'm worried about you.
[147:59.73]You knew that there would be a great sacrifice involved in gaming on Twitch, and this great knowledge of getting a little tired of your tortured conscious routine, you're in this
[148:09.76]Just as deeply as the rest of us.
[148:12.36]You must remain calm and keep everything having to do with the threshold in the strictest confidentiality.
[148:18.75]And please move your Mario Paint hand to the right.
[148:22.87]I would hate to have to lose you, Jonas.
[148:26.77]Sincerely, P.A.
[148:28.99]Warner.
[148:30.57]Make sure you download KidPix on your Mac.
[148:34.80]On your fucking old Mac computer.
[148:36.40]Who remembers KidPix?
[148:38.50]This was a tool.
[148:42.48]This was like the spread tool in Kid Pix.
[148:53.75]Kid Pix was fucking awesome!
[148:59.81]One of my friends threw up at his desk in computer class.
[149:06.74]We've all played Kid Pix.
[149:12.01]He had too many, he had too much box pizza.
[149:15.44]He fucking threw up.
[149:17.22]Alright, get me out of here.
[149:20.26]You guys remember box pizza?
[149:22.34]It was in a white box and you peeled it off and it was like a microwave square pizza.
[149:27.96]I remember, I remember.
[149:30.30]Get me out of here.
[149:39.01]Do I have to press a button?
[149:40.87]Okay.
[149:43.35]So I can't, I can, this is nothing to examine.
[149:50.59]Infection revelation.
[149:51.81]These are passwords.
[149:53.41]Do I have a, can I, do I have a phone?
[149:55.63]Cause I can call this number, right?
[149:57.73]There it is.
[150:08.09]Speaking of pizza, I'm like hungry now.
[150:09.85]Fuck.
[150:14.62]Hi, my name's Curtis Craig, and I was referred to Dr. Harburg by somebody, and I was wondering if I could make an appointment.
[150:24.27]Certainly.
[150:26.37]Let me see.
[150:28.47]You're in luck, Mr. Craig.
[150:29.59]We have a cancellation today at 5.30.
[150:30.91]Okay.
[150:31.17]After 5.30, do I need to leave work?
[150:44.26]Just go play Kid Pix.
[150:46.31]Hold on.
[150:47.27]I'm going to see.
[150:47.69]There was like this funny picture.
[150:50.09]It was like this weird icon.
[150:51.57]Hold on.
[150:52.19]Let me get it.
[151:01.94]Yeah.
[151:02.32]There it is.
[151:02.72]It was like a Nickelodeon logo.
[151:17.02]Careful!
[151:17.56]Okay, so let's go ahead and continue to play Phantasmagoria 2, the puzzle of the world.
[151:31.78]I'm just looking at chat, people are like, be careful!
[151:33.44]I'm like, oh, okay.
[151:35.42]Now that I'm thinking about this, that's, yeah.
[151:37.60]Probably not the smartest thing.
[151:41.88]So let's continue to play.
[151:47.51]I'm having like a nostalgia meltdown.
[151:51.34]Yeah, why not?
[151:54.70]Jesus Christ.
[151:57.50]Yeah, that's right.
[151:58.12]We have not even continued playing.
[151:59.68]We haven't even started.
[152:06.54]You know what else was... Number Munchers.
[152:08.76]No, no, no.
[152:09.38]What was it?
[152:11.55]Math Blasters.
[152:12.35]That was another one that was on the computer.
[152:16.34]Math Blasters, Number Munchers, Prime Number Munchers.
[152:24.77]So, what do I go to the doctor first?
[152:27.87]No.
[152:30.49]What the fuck?
[152:31.71]I'll miss my appointment with Dr. Harburg.
[152:33.50]I better wait on that.
[152:34.90]I'm not.
[152:35.22]What am I thinking?
[152:35.86]It's not time for my appointment with Dr. Harburg.
[152:40.46]So, what am I just to sit here and fucking waste time?
[152:54.06]Number munchers!
[152:55.18]You guys don't know what number munchers is?
[152:56.48]Let's go, like, have a drink and leave.
[153:03.76]So, like, were you totally grossed out when you saw Bob all cut up?
[153:10.36]Did you puke?
[153:10.80]No.
[153:10.90]I don't know, I didn't feel much of anything.
[153:16.49]It's kind of like seeing a dead cat in the road, you know?
[153:22.82]You must have been in total shock, huh?
[153:26.46]Yeah, must have been.
[153:27.20]This restaurant is really bad.
[153:30.92]Because what restaurant would have continuously empty open tables for a random guy, random people just to walk in and sit down?
[153:39.92]And it doesn't even matter.
[153:42.05]Walk in, sit down, don't order anything, leave.
[153:45.63]This restaurant is going to close.
[153:47.17]Get Gordon Ramsay in there.
[153:50.69]See if you can sort it out.
[153:51.55]Okay, let's go.
[154:02.64]It's not time for my appointment.
[154:04.62]I can't go here.
[154:08.30]And we're always in the same table, too.
[154:14.08]What else am I supposed... How... How... What... What's... Alright, I'm gonna look up the specific thing I have to do to make time pass.
[154:20.56]I'm only gonna look up the... The... Walkthrough when I literally have no other option.
[154:30.07]Gordon Ramsay from Chicken Nightmares.
[154:32.57]What...
[154:39.94]I have to quit the game to finish it.
[154:41.46]I mean, at this point, we're in it for the long haul.
[154:43.16]We're gonna be live tomorrow.
[154:44.28]By the way, we're starting tomorrow's stream early.
[154:48.90]We're gonna be streaming tomorrow at, like, somewhere in the afternoon.
[154:56.28]Because it's a weekend, and I figure, you know, let's do an EU-friendly stream.
[155:04.12]So, tomorrow, I'd say, at some point before...
[155:08.74]It's probably before 4 o'clock Eastern is when we're going to start.
[155:12.40]And go till probably like this, like 4 or 5 hours, something like that.
[155:16.52]Depending on what we play.
[155:19.16]Tomorrow, we're going to be playing a game for a long time because, I'll just tell you what it is because there's no hiding it.
[155:23.20]It was supposed to be after this game, but it's what we're going to play.
[155:25.70]We're going to play Vampire The Masquerade of Bloodlines.
[155:30.36]That's the game.
[155:31.34]That's the game of the weekend.
[155:34.67]I got the patch.
[155:35.33]I already have the patch.
[155:36.27]It's ready to go.
[155:37.47]We're going to give it a go.
[155:40.60]And then if I want to scare everybody, we're going to play Harvester to end the stream.
[155:48.84]And you will not have to stay up late if you're from the EU.
[155:55.18]So, that's what we've got planned for tomorrow.
[155:58.80]So now, let me look at this and go down here.
[156:01.12]Alright, what did I not do?
[156:10.26]We're like very far into the game at this point.
[156:22.93]Alright, I gotta get the mail.
[156:23.95]Alright, we gotta get the mail.
[156:31.65]Oh, this has got real boring.
[156:40.13]Time to get the mail.
[156:47.60]Oh, and call the Cthulhu as well.
[156:50.68]That's right.
[156:52.09]So, I might not be able to get through as many of the things I wanted to get through.
[156:56.87]I didn't expect I was going to get sucked into this.
[157:02.38]Mail.
[157:13.96]So we've got Call of Cthulhu, we've got Vampire and the Masquerades, and Harvester to check out tomorrow.
[157:20.92]If we do any, like all three of them.
[157:24.30]You're just noticing that it's getting boring?
[157:29.64]I guess.
[157:32.77]We only get to see one person have their face stapled.
[157:36.97]Kind of disappointed, not gonna lie.
[157:39.77]Actually, very disappointed.
[157:43.47]Alright, I think I can go... I gotta go back to... Win... WinTech.
[157:48.73]Thinking of you.
[157:49.99]Whips and kisses.
[157:53.57]The fuck?
[157:57.83]I already talked to the rat.
[157:59.53]I think I have to go back to WinTech.
[158:09.05]Save the game.
[158:09.79]Save game.
[158:11.69]Wow.
[158:17.44]Okay.
[158:19.92]Back in this room.
[158:22.48]I didn't go to the club.
[158:23.36]I couldn't.
[158:26.00]Move this shit out of the way.
[158:27.02]No, I don't want to do that.
[158:31.07]Let's go here.
[158:31.91]Alright.
[158:36.35]I can actually go to the doctor.
[158:37.35]Okay.
[158:48.15]Go talk to Trevor.
[158:49.09]Trevor's gone.
[158:49.61]I'm Dr. Harburn.
[158:50.45]Nice to meet you, Doctor.
[158:51.29]Nice to meet you.
[158:51.95]Go ahead and have a seat.
[158:52.84]I need a hammer, too.
[158:53.96]Make yourself comfortable.
[158:58.58]So, what brings you here today?
[159:02.12]Weird shit, Doctor.
[159:03.18]I've been having some trouble dealing with things lately.
[159:06.93]I keep getting freaked out by, um... Ah, nothing.
[159:13.55]I...
[159:15.64]I don't know where to start.
[159:16.86]You don't go to a therapist and just say, nah, never mind.
[159:22.54]Oh, okay, this got awkward.
[159:25.65]Okay, so I found this button on the ground.
[159:28.85]Actually, I actually do have to show this.
[159:30.09]This guy I work with, Bob, was murdered today.
[159:35.23]I don't mean just shot in the head either.
[159:39.69]He was...
[159:42.59]Spread all over my cubicle.
[159:46.67]I don't feel anything.
[159:57.46]That's not good.
[159:58.68]I don't feel anything at all.
[160:02.82]This has been all one day, apparently.
[160:04.98]Oddly enough.
[160:12.43]I do.
[160:13.35]I don't want to sit here and do all this.
[160:15.07]I don't want to show her every item in my inventory.
[160:19.87]I think they were happy then, but I don't remember.
[160:23.55]Uh-oh.
[160:27.03]This is baby me.
[160:32.01]Are we going to get to see another scary moment?
[160:36.89]I don't remember any of the good stuff.
[160:39.69]What?
[160:39.91]I don't remember my mother ever
[160:43.12]hugging me or kissing me or just hitting me good stuff I remember when she killed herself oh boy somebody said something a couple years later my father was run down by a drunk and an old plymouth
[161:13.24]Plymouth.
[161:15.96]That's in Massachusetts.
[161:19.40]I'm laughing at something else internally that has nothing to do with this on the screen.
[161:35.95]Have you seen this fun picture of me and my friends?
[161:37.87]This is taken at our company.
[161:39.65]This is what this whole game has been.
[161:42.70]Show people a picture.
[161:43.30]I had a lot of fun that night, I guess.
[161:44.54]Looks like you're happy.
[161:45.20]That guy got stapled.
[161:46.32]Who are those people with you?
[161:49.56]That's Trevor.
[161:50.48]He's my best friend.
[161:51.36]And that's Jocelyn.
[161:53.30]She's my lover.
[161:56.95]Yeah, it's funny.
[162:00.07]I've been keeping our work and our relationship a secret.
[162:04.23]Get together, I know.
[162:06.23]Are you in love with Jocelyn?
[162:09.85]Yeah, I think so.
[162:12.66]I don't think I'm ready.
[162:15.81]I'm kind of attracted to Trevor.
[162:22.11]And that worries me because I've never... I don't know if I should be with Jocelyn.
[162:27.84]I don't want to hurt her.
[162:30.42]Have you spoken to Jocelyn?
[162:31.36]It's the first time we've heard this.
[162:33.32]God, no.
[162:35.78]I have enough trouble opening up to her.
[162:37.36]It's funny, even...
[162:42.42]When we're making love, I don't feel totally close to her.
[162:48.90]I don't think I felt totally close to anyone.
[162:53.33]Alright.
[162:58.47]There's something I've noticed about this guy is he seems to have lots of relationships.
[163:06.17]Trevor confirmed.
[163:07.21]Trevor Rout confirmed.
[163:09.34]Yeah, we can get like the Trevor.
[163:10.66]Hopefully we get the Trevor ending.
[163:15.36]What about this?
[163:16.14]I already showed you that.
[163:16.88]What about that?
[163:19.64]I, um... I have a date with this girl from my work tonight.
[163:25.41]Her name's Therese.
[163:28.45]She is very sexy, and, uh... I don't know, though.
[163:32.83]I'm feeling... I'm feeling guilty because of my girlfriend, Jocelyn.
[163:36.89]Alright, so I got a girlfriend, Jocelyn.
[163:38.69]I'm attracted to Trevor.
[163:40.59]I'm going on a date with... Therese.
[163:43.55]No, I mean...
[163:45.65]Okay, we agreed from the beginning that it wasn't exclusive.
[163:48.57]Phantasmagoria.
[163:50.33]I don't have any reason to be guilty at all, do I?
[163:52.07]Well, I think that's for you to decide in your own mind and in your own heart.
[163:57.23]But let me point out, however, Curtis, that guilt is a very, very destructive emotion.
[164:09.04]How about you?
[164:10.04]You and me want to start talking?
[164:13.04]Can I pay her?
[164:14.56]Keycard?
[164:16.24]She's already seen that.
[164:18.58]What about the toolbox?
[164:21.74]You know, I found this really weird fucking toolbox in somebody's John Malkovich hole.
[164:28.32]I found this in John Malkovich's hole.
[164:30.10]Can you take a look at it and tell me what you think?
[164:31.80]What about this?
[164:34.40]Doctor.
[164:38.85]Oh, damn.
[164:39.27]This is hard.
[164:47.47]Not long before my mother killed herself, she started dressing me up as a little girl.
[164:56.95]This is getting, this is getting like, this is like going all over the place, huh?
[165:03.65]Pretty dress, pretty dress.
[165:05.75]It doesn't matter.
[165:08.05]It doesn't matter.
[165:09.23]It doesn't matter how I dress, you can still be a monster.
[165:12.09]What?
[165:13.08]Pretty little monster girl.
[165:20.94]They just unleashed a lot of shit on us here.
[165:23.90]We were playing, like, email fun.
[165:33.06]And, like, office hijinks.
[165:36.80]And now we're going into, like, lots of deep shit.
[165:38.50]Okay, um, I already showed you the button.
[165:42.28]What about the key?
[165:43.12]No.
[165:45.02]What is this?
[165:45.88]Is this...
[165:47.44]Dr. Harburg, I think that the company that I work for is conducting some sort of terrible, illegal experiment.
[165:58.65]Man, what the fuck is going on in the 90s?
[166:03.65]Evil corporations?
[166:06.15]People getting syringed?
[166:09.95]Soil and green is made out of people?
[166:16.03]Well, it's not impossible, Curtis.
[166:17.83]There have been huge corporate coverups over the years.
[166:23.15]That's your explanation?
[166:23.89]That's a pretty awful explanation.
[166:26.64]Well, geez, Curtis.
[166:27.60]I mean, there's government corruption everywhere.
[166:29.90]What's your next question?
[166:30.84]It's kind of embarrassing, but that kind of imagery has always fascinated me.
[166:42.16]It's nothing to be ashamed of, Curtis.
[166:45.42]Have you ever thought about why you like images of bondage?
[166:49.10]Oh, wait.
[166:49.56]What?
[166:49.88]What happened?
[166:50.90]What is going on now?
[166:51.76]Did I just show her?
[166:54.26]What did I just show her?
[166:55.26]I feel like the person in the picture is... What is happening right now?
[166:59.30]Somehow being held together.
[167:03.71]Like they can't come apart with all that stuff holding them in.
[167:10.01]Oh, my.
[167:10.51]Okay.
[167:12.99]Fascinating.
[167:15.58]Huh?
[167:20.74]Usually.
[167:22.45]You know, when you go... Therapists are laying this all on right now.
[167:29.03]Everything.
[167:29.99]Every deep thought.
[167:31.45]Everything's out on the table now.
[167:34.67]Inspect it.
[167:37.08]We already did inspect this.
[167:39.92]There was nothing wrong with it.
[167:41.82]What was wrong with it?
[167:44.57]Oh my god, that actually is... Okay, I thought... I didn't know what that was.
[167:52.35]I thought that was like a lamp.
[167:55.33]We already looked at this.
[167:59.53]I thought that was like some government document with like a lamp or something.
[168:05.70]Well, okay.
[168:09.66]Can't show that.
[168:10.70]We already did that.
[168:13.80]I think that's the only other option.
[168:18.46]Here's your card.
[168:19.44]I almost didn't call you.
[168:20.40]Because Dr. Merrick referred me to you.
[168:25.99]He was my doctor at the hospital.
[168:27.19]Yes, I know, Curtis.
[168:31.13]It's the limp from a Christmas story.
[168:32.93]Would you like to talk about your hospitalization?
[168:35.05]About Dr. Merrick?
[168:36.47]I didn't know it was like a... I'm not going to ask you anything specific about your hospitalization, but could you tell me if perhaps there was one single inciting incident that led up to it?
[168:47.24]See, that's the thing, Doctor.
[168:49.34]I don't... I don't know what happened.
[168:54.26]I just... One minute...
[168:57.17]I knew who I was, and the next minute I had no idea.
[169:00.03]This game is fucking dumb.
[169:03.50]It's hard to explain, but my identity just came apart.
[169:10.09]Plot twist.
[169:11.05]It's the doctor's butt.
[169:22.38]This game is so different from the first one.
[169:24.00]Yeah, I mean, the first one, it was like, people like blood and guts into a garden or stab somebody.
[169:29.72]Murder!
[169:31.30]This one is like deep psychological therapy.
[169:36.43]And hang out at work.
[169:39.53]They really took a different turn here.
[169:43.81]So do you think that my mother dressing me like Barbie has anything to do with my being attracted to Trevor?
[169:49.72]No.
[169:50.86]No, Curtis, I don't.
[169:52.29]Sexual orientation is genetic.
[169:53.97]However, the confusion that your mother instilled in you may be contributing to your disassociation with society.
[170:02.18]Okay.
[170:05.88]Alright.
[170:07.48]Huh?
[170:09.30]Huh?
[170:10.90]Okay.
[170:11.36]We got it.
[170:11.77]We're good?
[170:15.71]Any other deep shit that you'd like to say?
[170:17.63]I think we're done.
[170:27.09]no no no alright thank you doctor that was very okay look no offense but I am not very comfortable with this being here makes me feel like some kind of a wacko or something you're not a wacko curtis there's no stigma attached to analysis anymore
[170:51.01]Your brain is just like any other part of your body.
[170:53.63]And when it isn't feeling well, not only is it okay to get help, but it's smart.
[171:03.01]And more than the moral of the story is like gay straight.
[171:07.91]They don't matter.
[171:09.95]You do you.
[171:10.97]That's what that's all she could have said.
[171:12.17]She could have said she should have said don't matter you do you.
[171:15.07]And I would have been like, Alright, yeah, okay.
[171:19.83]Is it time to leave?
[171:21.57]I probably shouldn't be touching stuff on her desk.
[171:30.24]My mother used to have a snowstorm like this.
[171:34.96]I used to think that must be what her mind looks like.
[171:38.68]All broken up.
[171:39.42]All those tiny pieces swirling around inside.
[171:43.61]I get smashed with a snow globe, right?
[171:48.52]She started hating me when I was about six.
[171:57.85]Oh, Curtis, that was her problem.
[171:59.55]Fuck.
[172:00.79]Not yours.
[172:03.13]You were just a little boy.
[172:09.86]Well, Curtis, our session's up, but I think we have a lot of work to do.
[172:13.76]Was that session only like four minutes?
[172:17.31]Oh, okay, I guess.
[172:18.89]I don't want to go back tomorrow.
[172:20.19]I'll see you then.
[172:21.39]Thank you, Dr. Harper.
[172:22.07]You're very welcome.
[172:22.67]Where's, like, Jason?
[172:23.87]Where's the battle axes?
[172:26.85]Where's, like, the monsters, like, ripping people's limbs off?
[172:30.79]Phantasmagoria 2 is... Get... Have a doctor tell you all these things about you.
[172:38.26]Now let's go dancing at a club.
[172:51.99]That was some like fucking play like West Side Story dancing shit Were those ducks or were those people?
[173:10.98]I don't know
[173:14.15]What kind of director or fucking producer?
[173:16.99]Who says that that was what you wanted?
[173:19.57]Alright, should I fucking show this guy a button?
[173:32.26]Hold on, I'm actually gonna give this guy porn.
[173:34.94]He's gonna let me in.

[178:38.48]You have no business going into the pit.
[178:41.18]Into the pit.
[178:45.10]I don't think I want- I don't think I want to go in the pit.
[178:49.30]You assume I would like to go in the pit.
[178:50.76]Have you seen these pics yet?
[178:51.92]Aye aye aye.
[178:58.68]I'm still waiting for... She's just not here.

[179:24.91]She's gotta be ready.
[179:25.97]Look at those chains!
[179:30.23]Hi, Curtis.
[179:32.75]I'm glad you came.
[179:33.43]Okay.
[179:40.91]Let's talk.
[179:41.53]Anything we can do, let's talk.
[179:43.09]What kind of a club is this anyway?
[179:47.07]It's an S&M club, Curtis.
[179:49.05]Fuck.
[179:53.94]Do you need a drink?
[179:55.16]To cope with the ugly truth?
[179:57.24]What's up with the ugly truth?
[179:58.76]I find this pretty intriguing.
[180:01.83]Oh, it gets better, baby.
[180:06.59]I'm so ready.
[180:13.17]I am so ready for this shit.
[180:15.43]Should I give her the dress?
[180:17.12]Hey, can we talk about my childhood for a little while in this bondage club, please?
[180:24.80]um sure no photos to show her I think I said I just I just have to Dark Souls her and just exhaust all of her dialog options before she gives me a quest yeah listen I have to tell you something jocelyn and I are pretty serious about each other and you know what I don't really care okay she doesn't care do you think you're the only one I'm seeing
[180:52.39]Hey, whoa.
[180:52.79]Easy.
[180:52.97]Oh, God, what does that mean?
[180:54.09]What's she talking to?
[181:06.07]What?
[181:06.21]She's talking to the cameraman.
[181:25.37]Have you ever been whipped, Curtis?
[181:27.79]Oh, no.
[181:28.47]Have you ever been oiled down in candlelight and beaten with silk straps?
[181:34.45]This is not what I was imagining for the stream tonight.
[181:37.79]But we're here, and we're on the ride already.
[181:41.17]Sensual pain isn't like hitting your finger with a hammer.
[181:44.21]Oh, boy.
[181:46.68]It's intensely erotic.
[181:50.24]You're not over the age of 18.
[181:51.46]The stream is not...
[182:07.03]That was the waiter.
[182:08.57]Okay, the waiter has two jobs.
[182:10.63]He's a waiter everywhere.
[182:11.67]This is going to be poisoned.
[182:16.92]Oh, what the hell?
[182:17.36]It won't kill me.
[182:18.94]I hope.
[182:23.26]Yeah, this is going to be poisoned or something and I'm going to start hallucinating.
[182:25.78]I knew it.
[182:41.22]Oh No No, this guy like wants me this guy wants me to volunteer to get like fucking tortured My friend here does oh My god sure why not I
[183:07.98]Uh, why?
[183:10.06]I might have to, okay, we're gonna have to mute, and we're gonna censor, and we're gonna mute, and I'm gonna play something else in the background.
[183:15.88]Because this is not gonna happen.
[183:21.26]Okay, ladies and gentlemen, please.
[183:26.72]Alright.
[183:29.16]We're not gonna watch this, you're not gonna see this.
[183:42.00]Just... Hold on.
[183:47.60]Okay, that's better.
[183:50.22]This is more PG friendly.
[183:55.19]We're gonna put the censor here and just listen to this.
[183:59.19]Alright, this is somehow worse.
[184:06.80]This is somehow way worse.
[184:15.16]Are we almost done here?
[184:15.92]Okay.
[184:16.10]And there it is.
[184:17.89]We're good.
[184:36.14]Oh, god damn it.
[184:37.00]Hold on.
[184:37.46]Wait, wait, wait.
[184:40.18]Wait a second.
[184:40.84]We're not quite done with this.
[184:42.61]Oh, shit.
[184:43.33]Hold on.
[184:44.51]Wait, wait.
[184:45.07]I gotta move this.
[184:46.51]Move this!
[184:48.03]It's gotta be bigger.
[184:51.41]Wait, turn on the fucking...
[184:59.66]Alright!
[185:00.00]Are we done?
[185:00.64]No!
[185:00.80]It's done, right?
[185:01.44]Not quite done with it.
[185:25.60]Alright, we're good.
[185:26.52]We're over.
[185:27.22]Oh, wait!
[185:28.61]Okay, we're fine.
[185:31.35]Alright, we're in bed.
[185:54.45]We can get this off the screen.
[185:55.71]What is in my stomach?
[186:00.21]What?
[186:00.71]No, no, no.
[186:01.09]I gotta hold on.
[186:01.59]I gotta turn this off.
[186:02.35]Turn this off.
[186:04.07]I think I just subscribed to this channel.
[186:07.33]Turn this off.
[186:13.06]Wait, wait.
[186:15.84]No, wrong.
[186:17.14]Wrong.
[186:33.55]Okay, everybody everything we're back in the apartment everything's fine I
[186:47.41]Good.
[186:48.19]I'm just gonna move a couple things out of the way.
[186:50.29]The phone's ringing.
[186:52.03]Jesus.
[186:53.11]That was another full-on, full-fledged sex scene that we were able to carefully avoid.
[187:00.13]Where's the phone?
[187:00.82]Hello?
[187:03.18]Curtis, my boy.
[187:04.50]Why aren't you at work?
[187:06.76]Mr. Warner, I... No VODs for this one.
[187:08.46]I thought that after Bob and all that we wouldn't... Well, you thought wrong, Curtis.
[187:13.92]Get those lazy bones on in here.
[187:27.21]The kid's face being grabbed by the gremlin hand.
[187:36.52]That was too much.
[187:38.36]but the funny like the like children's lullaby music playing I did not think that through and you know I'm I apologize I mean you know you gotta say you're sorry when you say sorry alright uh here it is what's next how long have I been streaming for almost five hours we're gonna keep going we're not gonna stop
[188:05.28]I am going to take a short break, though.
[188:07.90]I'm going to go grab another... I'm going to get another water.
[188:11.48]I will return very shortly.
[188:12.70]I'll see you in two minutes.
[188:15.00]We'll keep this piano playing.
[188:49.47]Thank you.
[189:23.25]Thank you.
[190:34.13]That is the 90s for you.
[190:36.55]Sex, torture, a little bit of rock and roll, you know what I mean?
[190:42.51]Alright, let's keep going for, I don't know, maybe like another 20 minutes or so.
[190:51.52]I'm getting tired, I'm getting hungry.
[190:54.56]We'll see.
[190:55.84]We'll reconvene in about another 20-30 minutes.
[191:07.63]He's got a new belly button piercing now, apparently.
[191:11.11]Oh, by the way, I haven't caught up with bits at all this whole night.
[191:16.83]These games have been making me super tunnel visioned.
[191:22.36]The preview image for the stream is a sensor bar.
[191:24.64]Oh, my God.
[191:29.26]Why are we playing this?
[191:31.52]I don't know.
[191:31.98]Because it's Halloween, and you can get away with doing crazy shit on Halloween.
[191:37.39]Are we good?
[191:38.27]Audio good?
[191:38.75]We're back?
[191:39.13]Here?
[191:39.53]Hello?
[191:39.95]Yeah, cool.
[191:40.65]Hi.
[191:44.67]Worry about it at the end.
[191:45.49]Alright, let me open up.
[191:46.21]I'm drinking a V8 right now.
[191:53.40]We're in, like, we're, like, in too deep at this point.
[191:55.86]Right?
[191:57.94]I just hope there's not another, like, sex scene.
[192:06.23]Uh, mail.
[192:11.05]Yeah, V8.
[192:14.97]Could've had a V8, that's right.
[192:19.64]What was the goal?
[192:20.50]What was I supposed to be doing?
[192:30.94]Bridget's Books is proud to welcome best-selling author Adrienne Delaney.
[192:36.24]Ms.
[192:36.42]Delaney will be signing copies of her latest book, Coping with Loss.
[192:41.02]That was loud.
[192:42.71]She's pretty.
[192:45.31]Is this all this guy cares about?
[192:46.91]I gotta get it to a better level there.
[192:50.13]That should be better.
[192:54.96]V8 makes you feel like puking, huh?
[192:59.30]I'm gonna have to dis... I'm gonna have to sternly disagree.
[193:03.26]I think it's alright.
[193:06.51]So I didn't get anything from going there.
[193:10.51]Nothing.
[193:11.83]That entire trip was for no reason.
[193:15.59]So I... I better hold off.
[193:17.69]I have things to do.
[193:21.59]Just go back to Wintec?
[193:31.02]Tomato juice is nasty.
[193:34.47]It's good if you're on an airplane.
[193:36.43]This is new.
[193:39.65]I like it on an airplane.
[193:40.53]The hell?
[193:43.97]It's been plastered over.
[193:45.19]Oh, right.
[193:45.53]By the way, you guys didn't think this was worth playing?
[193:48.43]I'm trying to hide something.
[193:49.43]Those three guys doing the strange dance in a line.
[193:52.70]I feel like I was watching a Tim and Eric skit.
[193:56.48]That's how outrageous that was.
[194:02.31]Okay, I know how to get through there now.
[194:08.61]Smash that up.
[194:12.70]Really?
[194:14.36]You don't smash this up?
[194:19.60]In what world do I not break this with a hammer?
[194:30.51]Is this actually going to come in... No, not useful.
[194:39.14]Hmm.
[194:42.28]Okay.
[194:46.70]You don't smash a perfectly good patch job.
[194:50.33]That was a pretty bad plaster job, actually.
[194:53.15]You didn't even sand it.
[194:57.09]Where's your sanding skill?
[194:58.07]You're going to end up with bumps.
[194:59.90]I don't care about your productivity, Mr. Warner.
[195:02.63]You had no right to destroy evidence.
[195:04.87]I had every right to make this work environment safe and pleasant for my employees, Detective.
[195:10.13]This investigation would have been over in a matter of days.
[195:13.31]As it stands, your little redecorating spree may have caused you an obstruction of justice.
[195:17.73]Would you mind if we took this discussion to my office, Detective Powell?
[195:21.79]He's going to grind her up.
[195:23.99]She's going to turn into meat from The Simpsons.
[195:28.19]He's gonna feed it to Jughead Jones.
[195:30.57]What's that Simpsons character that eats it and he goes, Whoa, man, it's Bart!
[195:35.51]And he pukes.
[195:38.00]Alright.
[195:40.26]So we have some passwords to work with, right?
[195:46.94]So let's log into some people.
[195:48.10]Okay, let's go into... What was it?
[195:52.39]Infestation?
[195:53.01]No.
[195:53.21]No.
[196:05.11]Sloppy Jimbo.
[196:05.95]That's what it was.
[196:13.55]Who am I logging on?
[196:14.65]I think I just... I ain't doing any more computer shit.
[196:18.93]You know what I mean?
[196:24.40]I just... I don't want to do any more computer shit.
[196:28.64]And I can't... And alt-tabbing is a pain in the ass for me, so... Oh, God.
[196:31.72]Somebody's in there.
[196:32.18]Somebody's in the room.
[196:34.25]Somebody's just in the room.
[196:34.95]I got the cursor.
[196:43.15]Let's save the game.
[196:54.58]Where is it?
[196:54.92]It's right here.
[196:58.24]No, that's not it.
[196:59.10]Where is it?
[197:02.12]Infection, Revelation, Desecration.
[197:04.50]But who are they for?
[197:06.50]Revelation, Infection, Desecration.
[197:13.54]No, don't call anybody.

[197:23.76]Oh, people have no idea.
[197:28.86]Um...
[197:31.96]Well, I know Carpe Diem is this guy's, right?
[197:35.34]I don't know.
[197:38.50]I think that's just for the archives.
[197:44.65]I mean, I could just log into me and just see what's going on.
[197:50.87]Let's check my mail.
[197:52.03]Can you believe this shit?
[197:56.75]Here we are, supposed to be working away the day after a brutal murder.
[198:01.67]Happened in your cube.
[198:02.91]Uh, yeah.
[198:07.14]Well, I guess it could be worse.
[198:08.06]Warner could have left Bob here for me.
[198:09.54]Excuse me, Bob.
[198:10.30]Would you mind moving your liver off my keyboard?
[198:17.46]That actually scared me.
[198:18.44]Alright, let's go.
[198:19.16]Who cares?
[198:21.02]We had a good time.
[198:23.45]Bob Arnold Memorial.

[198:39.86]Can you believe this shit?
[198:41.34]No, I can't.
[198:41.90]Okay, hold on.
[198:49.79]High cholesterol.
[198:52.88]I can't concentrate on this.
[198:59.65]Venoman Carpe Diem Threshold Email Trevor.
[199:12.20]Memos.
[199:12.96]Okay, access.
[199:14.90]Okay, here we go.
[199:15.64]Infection Restricted Elevate.
[199:22.48]Hello, Ed.
[199:22.94]I realize that you and all security have been very busy over the past few weeks.
[199:27.48]But I'm afraid I'm going to have to make your life tougher still.
[199:29.94]I want to totally restrict access to the basement levels of Wind Tech.
[199:33.76]Preventing entry by anyone and everyone but myself and the threshold scientists.
[199:41.29]Okay.
[199:41.77]I don't want anyone going down there.
[199:43.43]Okay.
[199:48.45]So energy is... What was it?
[199:51.65]What's it called?
[199:52.29]Infection?
[199:53.41]Something else?
[199:58.24]the name what's the name of the what's the name of the I can't even look down here for it there's something something desecration what was the second one revelation hey Peter is excited here for the news the strange and unusual energy in the threshold uh in the meantime I trust that the threshold equipment is being monitored around the clock yeah yeah
[200:23.66]Synthesis, Dr. Pakabalava has expressed concern, however, that the wind tech generators might be unable to withstand the stress of additional activity.
[200:32.43]And then we have Curtis.
[200:37.63]Hello again, Ed.
[200:38.55]As my father used to say, there is an exception to every rule.
[200:42.81]The exception to the restriction policy I just sent you is an employee named Curtis Craig.
[200:47.61]He is not to be allowed anywhere near the basement or the threshold.
[200:50.97]I want to make that perfectly clear.
[200:52.82]However, in the unlikely event that he should make his way down to the basement, he is not to be quieted in any, shall we say, permanent manner.
[201:00.40]Rather, he should be detained and Dr. Terrace Merrick should be called immediately.
[201:04.78]Dr. Merrick will take Curtis' way to a safe place where he will no longer be a danger to himself or to us.
[201:09.51]Curtis is a special employee.
[201:10.99]I don't want him harmed.
[201:13.59]Because I'm the fucking... I'm the Guinea pig.
[201:18.75]Alright, interesting.
[201:19.55]Cool.
[201:20.25]Now we know the secrets.
[201:26.97]We got our secrets.
[201:30.99]That's it, right?
[201:34.95]Pretty good.
[201:35.47]Very interesting secret.
[201:37.09]Secret.
[201:39.21]Uh, now what?
[201:40.25]Oh, he's here.
[201:49.09]Hey, man.
[201:50.77]You believe they dragged our butts into work today?
[201:53.74]Yeah.
[201:54.50]We already said this in an email.
[201:55.24]You don't have to say it twice.
[201:56.12]It was almost worth it to see that cop chewing on Warner's saggy ass.
[202:03.64]Okay, I'm looking at how far away to the end.
[202:05.27]That's too bad she didn't pistol wiggle.
[202:14.11]Wasn't Phantasmagoria the name of like a show?
[202:19.61]It was like a show, right?
[202:25.67]It wasn't like a... I thought it was like a sick, twisted theater, like, play thing.
[202:33.54]Well, can I show him something?
[202:34.76]Want to see some bondage photos?
[202:37.00]No.
[202:37.30]What about the toolbox?
[202:38.20]No.
[202:38.42]The dress?
[202:39.02]No.
[202:39.72]Nothing.
[202:40.64]Button?
[202:41.18]No.
[202:45.27]It was a horror magazine.
[202:50.57]I can't get clearance?
[202:55.23]Let me just look and see what the next step is.
[202:57.43]We're getting near the end of the stream here where I gotta get some food.
[203:02.66]Hold on, let's see.
[203:12.32]What am I gonna get for food tonight?
[203:14.36]What's even open?
[203:20.12]Uh, hold on.
[203:33.11]Alright, we're almost at some interesting stuff here.
[203:35.95]I just saw somebody, like, dead.
[203:48.58]Okay.
[203:50.89]I think we just have to keep going this way.
[203:55.31]Five more hours.
[204:00.81]McDonald's?
[204:02.29]No.
[204:03.03]I can't do McDonald's.
[204:09.07]Did that movie even come out?
[204:12.73]When did the signs of the lambs come out?
[204:14.73]Before or after this movie?
[204:17.32]This game.
[204:18.50]Probably in the same week.
[204:20.52]That's why they're making the reference.
[204:22.47]We just have to talk to everybody.
[204:23.47]Hi, Josh.
[204:26.05]Sonic hearing.
[204:26.75]There it is.
[204:27.15]Oh, I can hear through the door.
[204:29.49]Hello, Curtis.
[204:31.21]Listen, I am so sorry about being such a jerk yesterday.
[204:34.86]I was pretty freaked out, I guess.
[204:38.00]I could really do without the ear piercing sound here.
[204:41.64]It's okay.
[204:41.94]It's okay.
[204:54.05]Mm-hmm.
[205:01.91]Curtis, I tried to call you last night.
[205:06.44]Couldn't reach you.
[205:08.04]The phone just kept ringing and ringing.
[205:10.14]Uh-huh.
[205:11.54]I was just in here.
[205:12.08]Why couldn't we say this before?
[205:12.86]I'm sorry, Jess.
[205:13.98]I just... No, no.
[205:16.64]Don't apologize.
[205:19.62]You don't have to answer to me.
[205:22.45]Do whatever you want to do.
[205:24.78]I know.
[205:25.24]Look, I just unplugged the phone and I took a sleeping pill, okay?

[208:41.37]Alright.
[208:43.67]It's diving.
[208:44.77]I think we might be at that point.
[208:46.17]Let's see if we can talk to Trevor one more time.
[208:47.95]We can.
[208:50.25]Hey, bud.
[208:51.81]How was your second date with the mysterious J, huh?

[208:57.37]I'm done.
[208:59.17]Big time.
[209:00.15]I feel like we're getting all these cut scenes in the wrong order.
[209:03.39]Sexy eyes, gorgeous cheekbones.
[209:06.97]I saw the squid beneath the skin.
[209:09.50]Oh, what a drag.
[209:10.34]Yeah, you're telling me.
[209:12.32]He spent half the evening picking apart Bela Lugosi's acting and the other half staring at his own bad self in the bathroom mirror.
[209:19.40]He doesn't like Bela?
[209:20.91]Mm-mm.
[209:21.75]I will piss on him then.
[209:23.17]Sheesh.

[209:39.40]But today I can't get the poor jerk out of my head.
[209:43.24]I keep seeing him splattered all over the walls.
[209:46.50]No wonder, bud.
[209:49.00]That was really nasty.
[209:52.19]Is there a better Trevor?
[209:53.27]He does.

[210:12.70]Alright, we got another asset queued up to play through.
[210:14.92]Nope, we don't.
[210:16.02]I guess we're going to go home.

[210:51.64]Am I like a different person?
[211:03.38]Well, I guess we're here now.
[211:12.27]That is not good for restraint.
[211:18.20]Okay, you put a belt around my body.
[211:20.28]You didn't attach it to anything.
[211:22.20]You just gave me a high-waisted belt.
[211:25.98]That's all that happened.
[211:28.14]Oh boy, what is this?

[213:27.36]That's my Barbie doll.
[213:29.08]Oh, man.
[213:29.52]There's probably a hundred of these.

[213:57.14]Oh, he's saying random foods.
[213:58.60]He's going to say it.
[213:59.52]Say it.

[215:34.67]Okay.
[215:49.97]Okay.
[215:50.79]Try to get the belt off.
[215:52.91]Hey!
[215:54.33]Stop that right now or I'll have you sedated.
[215:56.15]Does that say it's free?
[215:58.79]What's it say on the table over there?
[216:02.62]You're going to have me sedated.
[216:06.64]I'm going to cause a riot.
[216:08.84]Nurse, what am I doing?
[216:10.24]Why am I here?
[216:11.24]I don't belong here.
[216:13.68]Shut up, wacko.
[216:16.93]That's not what happened.
[216:18.69]Chicken McNuggets!
[216:19.85]Nuggets!
[216:20.21]Nuggets!
[216:22.13]Chicken McNuggets!
[216:24.17]Nuggets!
[216:26.09]He's so close to saying random things.
[216:28.51]Can I like wail down here?
[216:32.01]Chicken McNuggets!
[216:33.65]Nuggets!
[216:34.49]There's chicken.
[216:41.25]It's too bad he's not saying the word coffee, huh?
[216:43.49]That's unfortunate.
[216:45.78]Alright, well, I'm going to go here.
[216:47.18]I can't.
[216:50.26]I don't have any items.
[217:00.77]What the hell am I supposed to do?
[217:10.65]Why can I not look left and right?
[217:14.41]Two out of three.
[217:15.83]All I can do is just look around.
[217:16.93]There's nothing else back here I can do.
[217:26.48]Did I lose the game?
[217:29.04]Is the game just over?
[217:32.66]I think I'm just stuck here forever.
[217:44.37]I can't, like... I can't, like, interact with anything else.
[217:52.33]I can't, like, try to grab the belt anymore.
[217:58.65]Steal the ball.
[218:07.03]Oh.
[218:07.29]Uh-oh, I just caused a fight.
[218:08.82]No!
[218:14.85]Oh god, this is gonna get ugly.
[218:22.52]It's gonna be a chain reaction.
[218:23.64]It's gonna be a Rube Goldberg of crazy people.
[218:30.24]Got it.
[218:39.32]Okay, I got out.
[218:41.71]Uh, which way do I go here?
[218:43.01]I'm just kind of hanging out.
[218:46.62]Get me out.
[218:51.42]That guy just hit himself in the face with a croquet mallet.
[218:57.30]Well, this is the beginning of the game.
[219:12.66]I don't know.
[219:13.28]I didn't see.
[219:15.15]Did you see what happened?
[219:16.23]He just passed out.
[219:16.87]I don't know.
[219:17.99]He passed out.
[219:18.51]It's weird, man.
[219:20.19]These are all three love interests, by the way.
[219:26.60]All love interests.
[219:27.40]Hey, bud.
[219:29.20]You gonna live?
[219:30.92]Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.
[219:33.52]This is ridiculous.
[219:35.00]I don't give a damn what Paul said.
[219:36.85]I want you all to go home.
[219:38.15]Right now.
[219:40.17]He's the good guy.
[219:43.03]He sent all of us home, which means he's dead.
[219:46.67]He just threatened to kill us.
[219:48.49]You're terrible, Curtis.
[219:53.31]Go home and get some sleep, okay?
[219:55.68]He's dead.
[219:57.16]We're gonna wake up tomorrow.
[219:58.22]It's gonna be another thing.
[220:00.06]The fucking police are gonna be here.
[220:02.65]And this guy's head's gonna be mounted on a spike.
[220:06.41]I'll have your head mounted on a spike.
[220:09.59]Outside me office.
[220:10.63]Alright, go home.
[220:13.24]Go home and let's go to sleep.
[220:17.00]Time for bed.
[220:22.00]Oh, goodnight.
[220:26.93]Wait, I have to check mail.
[220:42.40]No, there's no mail.
[220:53.30]Nothing.
[220:54.75]Rat?
[220:55.09]Hello, rat.
[220:59.16]She keeps getting out of the cage.
[221:01.61]Rats are so much better than people.
[221:03.67]I agree.
[221:04.79]You're the only one I can really count on.
[221:06.51]How touching, freak boy.
[221:09.47]I can do it again.
[221:14.13]Relax, Craig.
[221:18.42]It's only blob.
[221:20.58]The only thing that loves you.
[221:22.90]I don't love you.
[221:23.64]I fucking hate you.
[221:25.38]You're a piece of shit.
[221:26.58]Oh, I didn't say it.
[221:28.55]The books are going to yell at me too.
[221:31.27]Wait a minute.
[221:31.81]These books are out of order.
[221:37.32]Enter the revolting psyche of Curtis Craig.
[221:42.90]This guy keeps walking over and seeing different books here.
[221:52.01]Does it say daddy?
[221:55.72]Alright, let's see if we can put the name in place on all these people.
[221:58.52]Well, here's like the actor photo.
[222:02.81]This is the photo that they all took when production wrapped.
[222:07.15]Like, this is like the sound guy.
[222:08.67]Here's the director.
[222:09.83]Here's like the camera guy.
[222:11.65]And here are all the actors.
[222:12.49]And this is like, if they had a, if there was a Twitter, if there was like a, these guys would all put it on their Twitter.
[222:18.30]Like, oh, so happy to work with DBA Studios.
[222:22.24]It was so much fun.
[222:23.04]And this is the picture that would be there.
[222:24.20]And now they use it in the game.
[222:26.52]Smart.
[222:31.24]Very smart, actually.
[222:32.43]And then that's to pretend like those are workers.
[222:37.78]Okay.
[222:46.45]Nothing else to do here.
[222:47.43]I just keep opening up this drawer like there's something new is going to be in this.
[222:53.11]There's not going to be anything new in the drawer.
[222:56.85]I can hit the toolbox.
[222:58.89]I can hammer the toolbox.
[222:59.87]That's a good idea.
[223:01.76]Wait, I get a mirror.
[223:02.70]I'm going to take a mirror selfie.
[223:04.48]Okay.
[223:11.26]Not again.
[223:15.85]Blood on the eye.
[223:22.06]He's doing like a fucking Robin cosplay.
[223:37.32]That clock is going really fast.
[223:38.60]You hear that?
[223:38.96]It's like... Okay.
[223:44.40]Watch out.
[223:44.86]Don't rub like the SpaghettiOs all over you.
[223:50.66]Alright.
[223:50.86]Let's smash this with the hammer.
[223:56.29]No.
[223:56.53]What are you doing?
[223:57.09]Put it down.
[223:57.91]You fucking idiot.
[224:00.03]Hammer.
[224:02.59]No.
[224:02.81]You don't use the hammer here.
[224:04.29]Wow.
[224:05.89]Okay.
[224:06.13]Okay.
[224:09.96]Alright.
[224:12.28]I don't have an appointment.
[224:14.46]I'm not going here.
[224:19.36]Hammer on the wall?
[224:20.20]I tried to do the hammer on the wall.
[224:21.26]It didn't work.
[224:24.60]Combine the hammer and the screwdriver.
[224:26.42]Can you even combine items in this game?
[224:30.60]I don't think you can.
[224:31.20]Let's just take a look one more time.
[224:38.89]No, I can't.
[224:42.16]Save it.
[224:43.10]I'm going to talk to the waiter.
[224:50.93]Can't open that.
[224:52.07]Security doesn't work.
[224:57.43]And we're leaving.
[225:01.03]Combine them on the toolbox screen.
[225:05.95]That would be weird.
[225:06.63]Alright, what about the waiter?
[225:09.70]Anything new?
[225:11.34]Oh, Trevor's here.
[225:17.60]Hey.
[225:18.96]Hey.
[225:21.24]Only drink milkshakes.
[225:24.81]Hey, Trevor, don't you think it's really weird that the human race can live off of chocolate milkshakes?
[225:31.17]I just find that so interesting, don't you?
[225:36.94]Hey, Trev, what's with the shake?
[225:39.02]Aren't you worried about your tiny waistline there?
[225:41.87]Just drowning my sorrows, bud.
[225:45.53]Yeah, I admit it.
[225:46.67]I kind of want to live in this universe where you only drink chocolate milkshakes.
[225:51.31]Shades?
[225:51.85]Chocolate milkshakes.
[225:52.69]Yeah.
[225:54.11]I got kind of freaked out this afternoon myself.
[225:57.43]God, it was just so weird sitting there, you know?
[226:00.31]Right where he got splattered.
[226:04.56]I'm telling you, we're out of order.
[226:08.91]All these are out of order.
[226:10.88]Somebody has to piece this full motion video game together.
[226:15.18]In order.
[226:15.54]I think I'll have a baked potato.
[226:18.94]What the fuck?
[226:21.38]What?
[226:23.29]You remember my Aunt Emily?
[226:25.75]Order a baked potato.
[226:26.57]It's milkshakes only, you fucking asshole.
[226:29.21]What are you, crazy?
[226:30.13]Yeah, that's the one.
[226:32.10]She always tosses her dinner leftovers outside for the... He couldn't believe it.
[226:36.77]I didn't want to order a milkshake.
[226:40.91]Shut up, my story.
[226:43.35]It's not a milkshake.
[226:44.57]Fuck you.
[226:45.53]She hauls back.
[226:46.91]She tosses this old, mangy, big, yucky baked potato outside.
[226:52.30]Big, yucky baked potato.
[226:53.66]And...
[226:54.80]It was beautiful, man.
[226:56.18]I mean, that woman has an arm like a pro ball player.
[226:58.44]And that spud just arced through the air until this sweet little bunny rabbit came hopping out of the bushes right into the path of destruction.
[227:08.24]No way.
[227:09.08]Way, afraid so.
[227:10.86]And that tater hit Mr. Bunny right between the ears.
[227:15.04]You know, for a moment, it looked like a little brown Jerma hulk.
[227:20.71]I've never seen a bunny rabbit jump that high in my life.
[227:24.03]You think that's funny?
[227:26.65]That poor rabbit is probably in therapy right now.
[227:40.26]I'm just walking out.
[227:41.86]I can't walk out.
[227:46.44]Have you ever had really horrible thoughts?
[227:51.25]God, what is it?
[227:52.27]What is with this fucking I don't want to talk about the horrible thoughts right now.
[227:55.16]Goodness gracious wanting to kill someone Trap I wanted to kill Bob every time he laughed at me.
[228:03.52]I just wanted to fucking kill him Everybody feels that way once in a while, man Don't worry about it
[228:20.87]Hey, listen, man, I gotta go.
[228:22.39]I've got a date for dinner.
[228:25.29]Someone new?
[228:25.67]Well, tell me about that.
[228:27.38]We're gonna share a milkshake.
[228:28.62]Okay, his name's Mike, and I met him at the pre-Raphaelite exhibit downtown.
[228:33.14]You didn't get so full drinking a milkshake before dinner?
[228:34.64]And he's smart and funny and cuter than hell.
[228:38.74]That's great.
[228:40.86]Well, have a good time.
[228:43.31]I'm gonna try.
[228:43.81]I just shit my pants.
[228:46.14]That was the eye stood up and you go, oh shit, I think I might have poo in my bum.
[228:51.46]I'm sorry.
[228:57.38]I think we have a chance with Trevor.
[228:58.44]I think you're right.
[229:03.10]Okay.
[229:04.06]What the fuck am I doing here?
[229:05.50]Somebody said to go back to the house and smash the thing open.
[229:14.26]Now you were saying to go like this.
[229:22.01]I don't understand.
[229:23.03]It didn't work.
[229:32.46]It didn't work.
[229:40.22]Hold on a second.
[229:44.11]One second.
[229:44.80]I'm going to look it up.
[229:46.30]Because we're getting close.
[229:47.98]I'm getting really tired here.
[229:50.16]I want to get to the end of this.
[229:52.70]Whatever this is.
[230:00.07]Okay.
[230:00.83]I see.
[230:03.25]Now I can do this.
[230:07.15]That is like a fucking... That is messy, man.
[230:09.31]That's messy.
[230:11.47]That's messy.
[230:19.63]What?
[230:20.85]Just stand up, cock your arm back, and swing the fucking hammer into the box as hard as you can.
[230:30.49]You'll get the stick.
[230:31.83]It'll come off.
[230:32.59]Don't worry.
[230:35.85]Just haymaker the box and it'll happen.
[230:37.59]Just do it like eight times.
[230:38.59]Do it like a hundred times.
[230:39.59]It'll break.
[230:43.01]What the hell is this?
[230:46.68]This is a... Dear... My dear Curtis.
[230:50.83]If you're reading this, I am dead.
[230:53.38]I've probably been dead for a very long time.
[230:56.20]My employees, Wind Tech Industries, will have arranged and carried out my murder.
[231:01.34]I know this is going to happen.
[231:02.32]I cannot avoid it.
[231:03.16]Before they come for me, I must confess to you, my only son, Wind Tech has been experimenting with forces it can't possibly control.
[231:11.05]I am ashamed to admit that I've been an integral part of that process.
[231:14.49]You must understand, Curtis, how excited I was at the prospect of working on something of this magnitude.
[231:21.05]I felt it could be important, beneficial to the entire human race.
[231:24.24]I was so immersed in the pure science of the thing that I started to forget my humanity.
[231:29.38]The Threshold Project is not in itself an evil thing, Curtis, but as long as it is in your hands, as long as it is in the hands of Paul Warner and the Warner Brothers, nothing can come of it.
[231:44.07]It is beyond the scope of their understanding and they mean to use it for unspeakable purposes.
[231:48.59]They've done terrible things, Curtis.
[231:49.79]People have died.
[231:51.10]I've tried to quit Warner Brothers to just take you away with me and leave.
[231:55.10]But they won't let me.
[231:57.58]Stop doing -2 in the chat here.
[231:59.54]I'm reading.
[232:01.51]I'm reading the note.
[232:04.61]Yeah, and the Warner... Look, I'm...
[232:08.00]Fine, you want me to read it normally?
[232:09.60]Forgive me.
[232:10.36]Forgive me.
[232:30.42]You're probably a man now, or very nearly a man, and you'll have been raised in the bosom of Wintec, a child of this monstrous corporation.
[232:38.75]Hope they've been kind to you, but now you must leave here, Curtis.
[232:42.49]Get as far away from Wintec as you can.
[232:44.99]Live.
[232:45.75]Love.
[232:46.01]Uh, who was the actress?
[232:50.96]Eat.
[232:51.44]Pray.
[232:51.76]Love.
[232:53.92]It's my favorite movie, Curtis, and never think about them or me again.
[232:58.07]I love you, Curtis.
[232:59.39]I love you with all of my heart.
[233:01.33]Be happy, Daddy!
[233:08.90]Julia Roberts!
[233:12.16]Okay, let's go.
[233:13.22]That's who it was.
[233:14.98]Uh, I gotta go up here and escape.
[233:16.26]Alright, now we... Now that's some heavy shit.
[233:23.26]is a heavy, heavy thing to say.
[233:27.84]Mm-hmm.
[233:29.02]Okay.
[233:33.26]Uh, now what?
[233:39.03]I'm frightening you.
[233:40.35]That's it.
[233:40.65]You don't sign your name Daddy.
[233:43.87]Oh, James Curtis.
[233:46.39]No, uh, Daddy.
[233:50.62]Take Trevor to the S&M Club.
[233:52.16]Is he still here?
[233:55.13]No, of course not.
[233:55.95]They're all here.
[233:59.17]Oh.
[234:00.49]Okay, did I catch you at a bad time?
[234:01.73]Oh boy, not this again.
[234:21.17]Should I show the picture?
[234:22.37]I got this from Dad.
[234:23.95]I found this letter that my father left me.
[234:27.76]Listen to this.
[234:29.14]He's going to read the whole thing.
[234:30.72]The Threshold Project is not in itself an evil thing.
[234:32.84]He's going to read the whole fucking thing in him.
[234:34.84]As long as it is in the hands of Paul Warner and Wintek, nothing good can come of it.
[234:40.57]Why didn't I do this?
[234:41.09]It's beyond the scope.
[234:44.07]Jesus, Doctor, does this sound like a crazy man wrote this?
[234:49.03]I don't think so, Curtis.
[234:50.37]It sounds perfectly rational to me.
[234:52.02]Perfectly rational?
[234:54.18]What the fuck are you talking about?
[234:55.46]Did you read this?
[234:57.64]Tell me the truth, Doctor.
[234:58.58]This is fucking Westworld all over again.
[235:02.16]Does insanity run in families?
[235:06.11]Yes, it can, Curtis.
[235:08.07]But that sort of mental illness is generally a chemical imbalance.
[235:12.95]And it's very, very treatable.
[235:14.67]Oh, God.
[235:16.95]Wasn't she recommended by the company?
[235:18.20]Yeah, she was.
[235:18.66]She's like a robot or something.
[235:27.78]You've got to stop it or I will.
[235:29.54]I'll kill you, you son of a bitch.
[235:33.71]After my father was murdered.
[235:35.53]Oh, that was his dad.
[235:38.19]Oh, my God.
[235:38.79]I never saw him dead before.
[235:41.59]He just wanted to get the mail.
[235:43.45]But after they hit him with the car, they got out and they shot him.
[235:49.17]Oh, my God.
[235:49.71]They shot him.
[235:50.71]Fantasmagoria.
[235:57.99]This is the bad end.
[236:05.69]I let my dad go through.
[236:07.93]My dad got the mail.
[236:09.43]One time I didn't get the mail from the slot.
[236:12.21]And this happened.
[236:21.84]Okay.
[236:23.40]Well, it's been fun.
[236:24.54]Doctor, why did you want me to come back again today?
[236:27.38]Fair enough.
[236:27.76]Fair enough.
[236:28.14]Oh, well.
[236:28.60]We just wanted to get the groundwork done.
[236:59.91]Are we done?
[237:02.07]Nothing else I can do with her?
[237:04.70]This again.
[237:05.20]On this date with Therese last night, I got my navel pierced.
[237:12.32]SMM club on stage in front of a room full of people.
[237:17.93]Is that something that you wanted to do?
[237:22.63]I don't think so.
[237:24.95]I don't know.
[237:25.33]I just
[237:27.49]I just wanted to be controlled at the moment, you know?
[237:30.43]Here we go again.
[237:31.05]We're watching this, like, movie again.
[237:36.63]But when it was over, my feelings totally reversed.
[237:39.01]I wanted to control her.
[237:42.80]How exactly did you want to control her?
[237:44.26]God.
[237:44.60]That was weird.
[237:49.40]Classic 90s.
[237:50.70]When I got off the stage, she was right there, and...
[237:57.11]Oh my god.
[238:18.24]Did you ever consider that maybe she was the one in control of everything?
[238:23.28]Oh, what?
[238:23.93]What a revelation.
[238:25.95]She's the one pulling all the strings.
[238:27.61]It's her.
[238:28.99]But you're probably right.
[238:34.01]Alright.
[238:34.43]Are we done with the doctor here?
[238:37.97]No, we've got to talk about the dress again.
[238:39.61]My mother's hatred for me went way beyond humiliation and hitting.
[238:48.18]I'm going to get electrocuted now as a kid.
[238:50.27]This is not.
[238:51.71]She tortured me.
[238:55.91]She did things to me.
[238:56.87]Hold on.
[238:57.63]Why am I getting electrocuted in a chair?
[239:01.23]Curtis!
[239:11.69]Oh, no.
[239:13.27]Oh, she's got a fucking knife.
[239:14.97]Alright, hold on.
[239:15.59]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[239:16.29]It's under that crawling, slimy skin of yours.
[239:21.74]It's alright, Curtis.
[239:24.52]Okay, we're okay, I think.
[239:28.36]She's gone.
[239:32.25]You survived it.
[239:34.75]Christ.
[239:36.73]You're here, Curtis.
[239:43.10]Alright.
[239:45.86]There's more.
[239:47.38]Doctor, I think that this threshold project, whatever it was, got shut down a long time ago, but I think it's been reopened now.
[239:55.15]In fact, I think it's back in full swing.
[239:56.81]What makes you think that?
[239:59.09]A whole lot of little things.
[240:01.43]Files I've seen, conversations I've overheard.
[240:04.77]I think it's bad, Doctor.
[240:08.10]I think it's something that no one has ever tried to do before.
[240:11.84]Now be sure you keep the difference between imagination and evidence clear on your mind.
[240:16.86]I will.
[240:17.92]I will.
[240:18.32]Don't worry.
[240:18.80]You think I've been watching too much X-Files.
[240:22.96]Another relevant show at the time.
[240:27.62]Doctor, I think I might have killed Bob.
[240:33.64]I don't remember doing it, but I can't get the idea out of my head.
[240:37.44]Nah, you never admit that.
[240:38.88]Don't ever admit that shit.
[240:40.04]The shit could be a plant.
[240:40.98]Relevant here.
[240:41.50]Maybe.
[240:41.70]Doctor, I think I may have killed one of my co-workers.
[241:04.54]He used to make fun of me.
[241:06.48]He used to call me an asshole.
[241:08.82]I tried to show him a picture of my dog and he scoffed at me and I gave him the finger.
[241:13.02]I think I may have killed him.
[241:14.24]Alright, is that it?
[241:16.80]Are we done here?
[241:21.02]After my mother started hating me, my father got so weird.
[241:32.34]He sort of
[241:35.16]What happens legally?
[241:37.10]Guys.
[241:37.86]Those of you guys that are like lawyers and like... Those of you psychiatrists that are here.
[241:42.63]If somebody tells you that they killed somebody.
[241:46.85]If somebody goes to a psychologist and was like, you know, I think I may have actually killed Greg.
[241:53.73]What happens?
[241:54.99]Oh, she hurt me.
[242:01.05]God damn it.
[242:02.95]She hurt me so bad.
[242:12.66]They're legally required to report it.
[242:14.58]Okay.
[242:18.80]I had this experience with my co-worker, Therese.
[242:23.63]The sex was... I accidentally just clicked that.
[242:28.13]This is going to sound really twisted, but... Oh, no more twisted shit.
[242:34.55]Sometimes I wish I could just live with Jocelyn and Trevor both.
[242:42.01]I think we made some wonderful progress today, Curtis.
[242:45.40]I'd like to see you again next week, but please don't hesitate to call for me to talk, okay?
[242:49.08]I will.
[242:49.56]Thank you, Doctor.
[242:52.38]Uh-huh.
[242:52.80]Bye-bye.
[242:52.98]She just cuts it short.
[242:54.12]Okay, I don't think I want to hear about this one.
[242:56.98]That's a little too extreme for me.
[242:58.08]There she is on the phone.
[243:02.56]In today's session with Curtis Craig, I determined that the patient was delusional, possibly paranoid, with a potential for violence.
[243:10.27]Oh, no.
[243:13.49]That's all, folks.
[243:14.27]I think I have to go here now.
[243:17.21]Wait, this is the... Alright, well... Is this the guy that gave me the piercing?
[243:23.55]I think it is.
[243:39.13]I know.
[243:39.97]I gotta be prepared.
[243:40.59]I think you'd be more comfortable in that yuppie bar down the street.
[243:44.63]Really?
[243:46.08]I think you'd be more comfortable in a sideshow.
[243:48.74]Damn.
[243:48.98]You know, I think I'm beginning to like you.
[243:51.16]Am I gonna go to the pit?
[243:57.34]No, no pit?
[243:59.21]What's wrong with my cursor?
[244:01.21]Ah, it's Shane here.
[244:01.95]Alright, can I go to the pit?
[244:10.39]Hey, have you seen Jay anywhere?
[244:13.72]Get the hell away from there, asshole.
[244:16.84]We're currently filming our third movie.
[244:18.38]I just don't know where he is, man.
[244:23.84]But don't tell him I'm here, can you not?
[244:25.72]I'm supposed to be quiet, but I just can't take it anymore.
[244:28.64]Alright, let's go.
[244:36.25]When it plays on.
[244:39.80]Alright, uh... Silent Bob doesn't talk.
[244:54.76]Department number 13 as well.
[244:58.04]That's not an omen.
[245:01.09]Who's there?
[245:03.29]Here comes the hallucination.
[245:04.53]Remember when we weren't playing this game?
[245:13.05]Okay.
[245:15.87]Therese?
[245:17.99]How did you get in?
[245:20.01]I'm a woman of many talents.
[245:21.71]She just breaks into my house.
[245:24.89]Curtis, come sit down with me.
[245:34.61]Have you been here long?
[245:36.49]Long enough to get to know your rat.
[245:42.07]She's a real sweetie.
[245:45.25]Oh, no.
[245:45.77]Thanks.
[245:48.42]No!
[245:49.20]Wait!
[245:49.78]Oh, shit.
[245:50.54]Okay.
[245:54.46]Okay, she's... No, I don't want to move that.
[245:56.98]Are we really going to do this right now?
[246:08.65]I need a fucking break.
[246:11.65]You know, you really startled me when I first came in.
[246:15.13]That was the idea, Curtis.
[246:17.35]Yeah.
[246:18.87]So, third sex scene of the night.
[246:22.28]That's good.
[246:22.56]Only when I really like them.
[246:25.52]Patrice, I don't want to be rude, but what are you doing here?
[246:29.84]Well... I didn't come here to talk.
[246:36.69]Well, what did you come here to do?
[246:38.45]Well, what did you come here for?
[246:49.56]Oh sh- I'm not so sure about this, Therese.
[246:54.03]Good.
[246:54.99]Oh my lord.
[246:55.69]Oh my fucking god.
[246:58.07]Okay.
[247:04.32]This is interactive.
[247:05.82]This is getting kind of intense, Trace.
[247:09.24]Oh, no.
[247:10.22]We're not even close to intense here.
[247:12.86]Okay.
[247:13.38]Well, uh... That's it, guys.
[247:17.58]That's it.
[247:18.42]That's it.
[247:36.14]Thanks everybody for watching.
[247:38.80]That's where I'm going to end the stream.
[247:42.20]It's time for me to go to bed.
[247:43.32]It's been about six hours.
[247:44.65]That's it.
[247:45.15]Have a good rest of your evening.
[247:47.59]Oh, you can still hear this.
[247:48.53]I forgot you guys could still hear them talking.
[248:02.09]Don't you dare.
[248:04.77]Jesus.
[248:05.25]Turn this fucking thing off.
[248:08.75]I think you're a good boy, Curtis.
[248:10.93]What?
[248:12.07]A very good boy, indeed.
[248:16.38]Alright.
[248:28.26]It's been saved.
[248:30.89]Thank you everybody for coming to the stream.
[248:34.49]This is a long one.
[248:37.39]Before I go, I'm going to mention, uh, tomorrow the stream is going to be at like probably somewhere around like four or five o'clock Eastern.
[248:45.80]I'm going to start like at least two or three hours early.
[248:53.47]Thank you for enduring that nonsense.
[248:57.80]It got weird, but it was still fun.
[248:59.78]It was weird.
[249:00.92]It was a little weird.
[249:02.34]It's alright, though.

[252:59.28]I am absolutely hysterical.
[253:00.66]Thank you.
[253:01.04]I think you're referring to when we tried to not get the stream banned from the sex that was on the screen.
[253:06.93]But I...

[253:10.25]Thank you.

[253:13.31]Thank you ivory for the $1 From a reliable source concerning that scene No club of that establishment can serve alcohol ever to such acts must consider a safety word or firmly established relationship
[253:31.58]Explicit or extreme acts can only be done with members who are aware of the scene or comfortable with it if no one knows before Is this like a fetish almanac?
[253:39.75]Is this like a bondage almanac?
[253:44.61]It is incredibly risky situation why all of that is Why out of all that is did you pick that music?
[253:52.02]I don't know The BDSM almanac
[253:56.98]but thank you ivory words to uh words to live by if you're ever doing that on the bondage guide uh airless thank you for the bits as well fox ski or fox foxy I'm an idiot thanks for the two dollars and fifty cents I watch so many of your vods and streams that I've genuinely started to talk like you my friends are starting to think I'm some kind of weirdo Kappa
[254:19.80]Well, they do say that the more you listen to somebody or the more that you spend around them, you pick up a large amount of their mannerisms.
[254:29.50]So, I don't know.
[254:30.48]Maybe you're just picking up some mannerisms.
[254:32.51]I do it to my friends.
[254:33.59]People have told me that they picked up random things from me, too.
[254:36.63]That's just humanity.
[254:38.27]It's just humanity.
[254:40.27]Also, Foxy, again,
[254:43.82]saying that that's another $2.50, reiterating that I think I need to stop watching you, Jeremy, because I'm starting to talk like you now.
[254:53.01]Well, you don't have to do that.
[254:56.61]You can stop watching me for any reason, but you can also start watching me for many others.
[255:01.46]But thank you, Foxy, for the $5.00.
[255:04.51]Malta bartender again.
[255:05.49]Thanks for the bits Freck Ster.

[255:20.76]But anyways, thank you
[255:23.06]Nick Fu, thank you for the $1.
[255:24.78]This is late, but thank you for your streams and videos, Jeremiah.

[255:31.11]You never fail to get a laugh from me, and thank you for that.
[255:33.15]Sorry I can only give a dollar or so, but I'm wishing you the best.
[255:35.39]Much love from a starving artist.
[255:38.18]I'm going to reiterate, make it clear one more time.
[255:42.77]If you don't feel any obligation, don't feel bad or sorry that you can't give me money.
[255:47.39]Or if you're certain a denomination of money you don't think is enough.
[255:52.16]You being here watching the stream is immensely, immensely more fucking important than like giving me dollars.
[256:01.74]It just is.
[256:03.24]So do not worry about that at all.
[256:05.32]Don't let that ever jump into your head ever.

[256:29.67]$1.
[256:29.69]Hey, what's your opinion on the rectangular cardboard ice cream packaging?
[256:35.47]I personally fucking hate it.
[256:37.40]It has the same problem as Pringles, but it's worse and the box falls apart.
[256:41.76]Rectangular cardboard ice cream packaging.
[256:46.84]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[256:50.58]Like you're talking about an ice cream sandwich?
[256:54.10]Those come in like weird wax paper.
[256:58.00]I don't know.
[256:58.42]I have no opinion.
[256:59.02]I can't tell you.
[256:59.52]I have no idea.
[257:01.52]Thank you Private Tickles for the $2.
[257:02.96]They just said share $200.

[257:37.90]Thanks for the bits.
[257:38.82]Eat garbage on stream.
[257:41.69]I don't think I want to do that.
[257:44.71]I'm not going to eat garbage on stream.
[257:47.09]Well, I mean, it depends on what you think.
[257:48.59]What do you mean by garbage?
[257:50.69]Do you mean like fatty gross foods?
[257:53.00]Or do you mean like actual, like a raccoon going into the trash and eating trash?
[257:58.20]Because I'm not going to do that one.
[258:00.58]Never trust a purple.
[258:01.28]Thank you for the 10 bucks earlier.
[258:03.30]They say solid start.
[258:06.65]And by solid start, you mean bad start.
[258:09.74]Because the first game was really dumb.
[258:12.50]And so was this one.
[258:13.30]But yeah, that's the classic.
[258:15.76]Phantasmagoria 2, a puzzle in time, is like one of the most classic, shitty, FFV... Yeah.
[258:24.66]Horror games.
[258:26.06]FMV horror games.

[258:41.22]Police have put an end to my running.
[258:44.14]I'm so far from home.
[258:45.40]The jig is up, Jerma.

[259:09.76]What did I do?
[259:10.20]I don't know.
[259:12.48]I'm scared to read like... I'm scared to read paragraphs now because I feel... Even when things are like, Hey, Jerma!
[259:18.48]I want to let you know that I just really was liking this stream.
[259:21.32]I'm like, is this a song lyric?
[259:23.26]Is this a song lyric that's going to be bad?
[259:27.88]It's literally Styx Renegade.
[259:30.05]Wait, what?
[259:31.29]How do you not know the Styx?
[259:34.59]I know Styx like the fucking shitty goblin on Steam.
[259:39.44]I am cultureless.
[259:48.53]You literally just read the lyrics for Renegade by Styx.
[259:54.49]Wow.
[259:54.91]Okay.
[259:55.37]That's good.
[259:56.07]I like it.

[261:56.80]What's this?
[261:57.22]I appear to have dropped the keyboard controls for Clive Barker's Undying.
[262:00.44]Aye, aye, aye.
[262:04.21]Not even their song.
[262:05.19]Yeah, there was a Michael Jackson song that they stole and made like a million dollars and then gave up and stopped making music.
[262:12.01]What would you do?
[262:14.73]Sly161, thanks for the $5.
[262:16.05]Hey, Jerem, you ever think about playing the SCP game again?
[262:20.58]It'd be fun to see you get back into it after all these years.
[262:23.46]Especially since it's a part of the SCP Wiki staff now.
[262:26.65]I think the game has been updated a lot too.
[262:28.41]Well, thank you, Sly161, first of all.
[262:35.33]The SCP games are, those games are all, I think, at least for me, I got what I wanted out of them.
[262:43.08]And horror games for me at this point, I don't know if I'm into the whole kind of walk around and pick up stuff while something screams in your face.
[262:52.50]I know that's like probably not what most, I mean, the SCP games, in my opinion, really like paved the way for most of our current like horror, scary games that have been really releasing recently.
[263:05.12]Those original SCP, what was the first one when you're on the stairs?
[263:11.25]When you're walking down the stairs, Containment Breach is fantastic.
[263:13.89]It is.
[263:14.69]Containment Breach is great.
[263:16.45]I played, I have a video on Containment Breach, I think, somewhere on my channel.
[263:23.53]But like the actual stories, right?
[263:25.81]From my understanding, SCP is a series of like stories and the games were interpretations of those stories, right?
[263:34.53]But that's cool.
[263:37.01]You were referring more to Containment Breach, okay.
[263:38.95]They updated it a lot.
[263:39.87]I'll definitely take a look at it and see if it's something I wanna do, you know?
[263:45.24]But thanks a lot, man.
[263:48.28]Let's see, almost done here.
[263:49.74]We're way back to the beginning of the stream.
[263:53.80]Uh, Wild Omelet, thanks for the 25 cents earlier.
[263:58.84]Anonymous, thanks for the $1.
[264:00.82]I like your stream.
[264:01.43]Well, I like you, Anonymous.
[264:03.85]Turian7, thanks for the $5.
[264:06.41]Call the ranger, he's crying.
[264:09.49]Turian, is that a Shadow of War reference?
[264:11.49]Am I supposed to call Talion, whatever his name is?
[264:16.48]Thanks, dude.
[264:19.22]Nocta, the liver seagull, thanks liver seagull for the $1.
[264:24.79]Hold on.
[264:27.23]Okay.
[264:28.23]This is a... I'm being corrected right here.
[264:31.11]Okay, this is good.
[264:32.89]It's spelled... Noctal... Noctal Evergal.
[264:40.25]Please call me Noc and not Liver Girl.
[264:42.67]I love your streams.
[264:44.52]Well, thank you, Noc.
[264:45.86]I'll call you Noc from now on.
[264:47.60]Appreciate it, though.
[264:48.24]Thanks for the correction.
[264:50.71]Monty the Moose thanks for the 342 as well as the graphic gore and violence the I would have a fan phantasmagoria I think it has Magoria was banned from most retailers in Australia by decree of the government's office of film and literature classification the governments of two other countries also banned phantasmagoria the game was spot the game was spotlighted in the US Senate hearings debating regulation of content in the computer software industry
[265:21.47]So, I guess, you know, banned content.
[265:26.73]BluePunda, thanks for the five bucks.
[265:29.35]I can't remember what you said about it earlier, but it would be so cool if you played The Witcher games.
[265:33.52]Or at least tried the first one since it's an old game, and now you seem to like old games.
[265:36.88]jermaSlug.
[265:38.40]Anyway, I still love you, Germs.
[265:40.08]Also for, sorry for interrupting the flow of the stream.
[265:42.80]You're not interrupting anything.
[265:46.49]What are you talking about?
[265:47.33]You're fine.
[265:50.27]you're not interrupting the damn thing don't worry alright well I'll give you an answer here I played The Witcher 1 and I played The Witcher 2 but the unfortunate problem I played The Witcher what was the one that had the enhanced edition what was the one where like literally going from in the middle of town into a shop was like a 4 minute loading screen which one was that because that's where I gave up
[266:20.97]I want you to know.
[266:25.08]I just couldn't do it anymore.
[266:26.26]It was like I'd go to complete a quest and I'd have to wait like six minutes.
[266:28.92]And it's just like, holy shit.
[266:31.23]And they fixed it eventually.
[266:32.55]They came up with a new version and whatever.
[266:34.83]But I keep hearing about The Witcher 3 and obviously I made a joke about it in that video I made a couple years ago.
[266:42.01]Whatever it was.
[266:42.47]I have not played The Witcher 3.
[266:46.39]I know it's one of those games where if you don't play... Saying you haven't played The Witcher 3 is like saying you have never seen Breaking Bad.
[266:52.93]You get the same reaction.
[266:55.13]The person like drops their drink and like gasps and like grabs you and is like, go home right now and open up Netflix and start episode one.
[267:02.74]But.
[267:04.52]Regardless.
[267:06.42]Thank you so much, everybody.
[267:08.40]Oh, God, we have more and more and more popping in.
[267:12.73]Moo means moo right now gave five dollars.
[267:16.83]Uh.
[267:18.34]How the trip never stops.
[267:20.08]On and on.
[267:20.62]It's beyond insane.
[267:21.46]Why I set myself up in a raging sea of flames.
[267:24.31]More lyrics.
[267:24.99]Thank you.
[267:27.99]Molotov bartender.
[267:28.89]Thank you for the bits.
[267:29.43]Update on the LA trip.
[267:32.71]Let's just say there is no... It's off.
[267:40.32]It's not happening.
[267:41.38]Everything that I was going to potentially do is not happening.
[267:44.20]And moving away, I'm going to go solo.
[267:46.70]We're going to do a solo career here.
[267:48.94]And do not be surprised if in the next few weeks, but within the next month, I just go forward with the Patreon idea.
[267:56.95]I think that's what's going to happen.
[267:59.31]Oh, don't be sad.
[267:59.95]Don't be sad about this.
[268:01.63]This is kind of my doing.
[268:04.35]I'm like, you know, just didn't work.
[268:08.37]Didn't work out.
[268:09.93]So I think Patreon is going to be the way that I'm going to try to do it.
[268:13.86]So, and the Patreon money, like I know I have to, I'll make, I'll make this very clear whenever I bring it up in reality.
[268:23.93]Any money that I would be getting from Patreon would not go to me.
[268:27.07]Like it would literally go to a separate bank account that was only used to make videos.
[268:31.01]That's it.
[268:32.26]Like, I'm not going to take out, like, oh, yeah, what did I get?
[268:36.67]$28,000 from Patreon?
[268:38.01]Oh, you guys want to go to fucking Vegas?
[268:39.99]Like, no.
[268:40.61]Like, every cent of that would just be used solely in a different account for only productions.
[268:44.93]That's it.
[268:47.68]Finally.
[268:49.54]We'll see.
[268:50.70]But...
[268:52.58]Anyways, guys, thank you so much for watching.
[268:54.16]I'll see you guys tomorrow around like probably four to five Eastern, something along those lines, but at least before seven, like before seven, before six, I want to try to get another EU friendly stream in and we're going to play Vampire the Masquerade Ball and Call of Cthulhu and maybe something else.
[269:13.43]But good night.
[269:14.68]That's my time.
[269:15.80]I will see you guys soon.
[269:17.08]Take care, everybody.
[269:18.32]See you tomorrow.
[269:39.60]Thank you.
