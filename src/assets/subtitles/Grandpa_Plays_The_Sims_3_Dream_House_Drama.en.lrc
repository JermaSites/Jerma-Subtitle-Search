[00:01.99]This one goes out to all you watching the video right now.
[00:05.46]We're playing The Sims 3, baby!
[00:07.28]Here we go!
[00:08.86]What will I do?
[00:10.56]The choices, they're true.
[00:12.56]I'm not sure, but I want some time to maybe think about.
[00:16.36]Maybe I'll build a house.
[00:18.33]Maybe I'll make some food.
[00:20.37]I don't know, but it's time to begin The Sims.
[00:24.15]Maybe we'll have some... Oh, shit!
[00:27.39]Don't pick... Oh, God.
[00:30.21]This is why you don't move your hands around when you sing a song.
[00:33.39]I knocked over the fucking lamp that was on his desk.
[00:37.48]Okay, let's take a look here.
[00:39.04]Uh, I do not want this biker jacket.
[00:42.26]Oh, by the way, for those of you interested, this is exactly what I look like in real life.
[00:46.94]Uh, I don't want this, like, jazz club waiter shirt.
[00:50.82]Get rid of this fucking thing.
[00:52.87]What else we got here?
[00:53.73]We got, like, the snow vest.
[00:55.85]We got, um...
[00:58.64]That weird looking thing.
[01:00.42]We got Christopher Robin from Winnie the Pooh.
[01:02.60]No, fuck that.
[01:03.42]No, thank you.
[01:04.94]What else we got here?
[01:06.40]Businessman.
[01:07.36]I think I could put the business... Oh my God.
[01:11.40]This is perfect.
[01:13.80]The smoking jacket with the green.
[01:16.20]I wear this shit every single day.
[01:17.78]I don't even wear pants.
[01:20.65]Okay, so you can't have just underwear.
[01:22.81]That's bullshit.
[01:24.13]But anyways, let's make my name here.
[01:26.54]Grandpa.
[01:28.02]And last name.
[01:30.56]What is my last name?
[01:33.64]Yonko?
[01:35.02]Yombo?
[01:35.86]Something like that.
[01:38.14]Hey, Jeremy!
[01:40.72]Yeah?
[01:41.15]What's our last name?
[01:43.05]What?
[01:45.11]What's your last name?
[01:46.79]Why do you want to know?
[01:48.71]Just say it.
[01:50.30]My last name's different.
[01:51.16]You're on Mom's side, so... I don't even know what my fucking first name is!
[01:56.40]Now let's do it!
[01:57.38]Let's move into an empty lot and I'm gonna build my dream house!
[02:02.32]It's gonna be so much fun!
[02:04.48]Loading up the screen.
[02:05.66]There he is!
[02:06.72]There I am!
[02:07.46]Grandpa!
[02:08.68]So let's do the build tool here.
[02:10.42]Gonna make my absolute dream home that will rival the celebrities of the world.
[02:18.30]So let's go here.
[02:19.14]We need some walls.
[02:21.18]And I think I'm going to go up this left here.
[02:24.58]Start with this little hallway.
[02:26.30]Let's start here.
[02:27.36]Go all the way up here.
[02:29.84]$2300.
[02:29.86]Holy shit.
[02:30.30]Build this over this way.
[02:31.64]Make sure it's all the way to the right.
[02:40.81]Okay, that looks good.
[02:43.39]Bring it all the way down like this.
[02:46.27]There's my little room here.
[02:47.56]Come along this way.
[02:51.64]Yes!
[02:52.42]Yes, I did it!
[02:53.26]This is a dream house!
[02:55.26]Okay, let's do it.
[02:56.20]Build the furniture now.
[02:57.40]Let's put in... Obviously, I want to... Where's the toilets?
[03:01.36]I need toilets.
[03:03.22]Yeah, there you are.
[03:04.90]Make sure we have at least a few of these.
[03:07.50]Because I don't like to walk.
[03:09.74]Because my legs are really not that great.
[03:12.45]So I want at least... Let's just say like seven or eight toilets in the house.
[03:17.49]So wherever I am, I can always just sit down and take a shit if I need to.
[03:22.61]And that'll be dandy and Randy.
[03:25.48]Now we need a... What else is in a house?
[03:30.99]Bed is lined up the way I want it.
[03:32.85]Got my fridge.
[03:34.13]Now I just need a TV.
[03:35.69]Okay, let's put the stand here.
[03:38.05]So I can watch my murder mystery to click on the TV.
[03:41.65]This TV looks pretty good.
[03:43.99]Make sure it's lined up with the bed.
[03:45.86]And it is.
[03:47.78]My fridge is all set.
[03:49.98]And I think that's it.
[03:51.16]That's good.
[03:52.30]This house is fucking great.
[03:54.80]I wish I could live in this house for real.
[03:57.67]It's got everything I could ever need.
[04:00.31]Get over there.
[04:02.37]Go see your new house.
[04:05.10]Why am I talking to a mailbox?
[04:07.00]I'm not that stupid.
[04:08.90]And apparently I have a stick up my ass by the way I'm running.
[04:12.68]Yes, I love the bed.
[04:14.06]We are agreeing on that together.
[04:16.68]As one.
[04:18.14]So what am I going to do?
[04:19.06]What TV show am I going to watch first?
[04:20.85]Maybe Murder, She Wrote?
[04:22.97]What?
[04:24.87]Why am I... What is this?
[04:29.03]Why did I just fucking puke?
[04:32.98]Oh, so I just made Jerma.
[04:34.63]He's on the left.
[04:36.05]Jeremy is my grandson.
[04:37.67]He's... I think that looks just like him, but... He's apparently being a real asshole.
[04:42.13]There's nothing I can do about this besides tell him, this is my house, you're under my rules, and you need to learn to be respectful.
[04:50.23]And now he's pissing his pants.
[04:52.37]I don't know why that's happening.
[04:54.39]There's a toilet literally one inch to his left.
[04:58.12]Okay.
[04:59.72]You know, I made way too many of these lights.
[05:02.69]I probably should turn some of these off or delete them or something.
[05:05.45]How do you turn that off?
[05:07.61]Yes, go do it.
[05:09.19]I'm supposed to be cooking dinner right now on the stove.
[05:12.27]Please turn the damn light off.
[05:14.67]Where's Terma?
[05:15.31]Can he turn it off?
[05:16.53]Oh, good.
[05:16.87]I think he's going to do it right now.
[05:18.85]Go turn that off and we'll get going here.
[05:21.15]You don't have to be...
[05:22.96]Oh, no!
[05:23.90]Oh, there's a fire!
[05:24.74]There's a fire!
[05:25.44]Somebody put that fire out!
[05:27.05]Don't just stare there looking at it, you fucking idiot!
[05:29.35]Put the fire out!
[05:30.23]Use the fire extinguisher, or call the goddamn police!
[05:33.99]Oh, he's running now.
[05:35.05]Yeah, go ahead and run, you coward.
[05:37.41]Where is he going?
[05:38.57]Where are you running to?
[05:40.42]Where do you think you're gonna go?
[05:41.88]It's a small fire.
[05:43.16]Grandpa will take care of this one.
[05:44.92]I got this one.
[05:45.66]Don't worry.
[05:46.12]Extinguish the flames.
[05:48.76]Who the... Who's that?
[05:51.50]Who is this guy that just came to the house?
[05:53.74]Who are all these people coming to the houses?
[05:55.64]What the fuck is going on?
[05:57.82]Yeah, I'm so glad you guys all ran over here to just scream at my fire.
[06:01.38]Like, thank you.
[06:02.26]Will somebody call the police?
[06:04.07]Is that gonna be a thing?
[06:05.27]Can somebody do that, please?
[06:07.69]Oh, my God.
[06:08.91]It's fire spreading now.
[06:11.79]Yeah, whatever.
[06:13.87]Well, that's gonna wrap up this video.
[06:16.41]My whole friggin' house is burning down.
[06:18.46]Nothing I can really do about it.
[06:20.43]But if you liked this video, then click on that like button and show Grandpa some support, baby.
[06:26.27]And that's gonna be it.
[06:27.41]So, I'll see y'all later.
[06:29.65]And bye.
[06:30.87]I'll tell you, the next time I play this game, I'm gonna have the goddamn fire extinguisher ready to go.
[06:37.82]And not only that, I'm gonna have a fucking phone next time.
[06:40.42]So I can call the police and my friends and stuff.
[06:43.34]You'll see, next time's gonna be a lot different.
[06:44.84]I will make sure of that.
