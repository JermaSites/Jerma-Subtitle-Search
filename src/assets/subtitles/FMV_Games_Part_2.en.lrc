[00:01.19]Hello.
[00:02.87]Welcome.
[00:09.65]How are you?
[00:14.54]You doing good?
[00:17.88]So sorry for the abrupt ending last night.
[00:21.78]We may get another one.
[00:23.76]I don't know.
[00:25.80]It's really kind of up in the air at this point.
[00:29.81]So around like 7 to 8 o'clock, maybe earlier Pacific, we might just go... I don't know.
[00:40.87]We're gonna do what we can in the meantime.
[00:44.75]If you're wondering what we're doing tonight, we're continuing the FMV game catalog.
[00:52.91]There are still plenty to go through.
[00:55.96]Some of these are extra crusty, and by extra crusty I mean they might just stop working halfway through.
[01:05.38]Some of these are so crunchy... that... we might not be able to see past the menu on some of them.
[01:14.07]I don't know.
[01:15.27]I tried to test as many of them as I could.
[01:17.13]But sometimes... you get the... cheese stuffed crust.
[01:25.46]So not only is there crust, there's cheese in there too.
[01:28.16]Which sometimes that's a good thing.
[01:29.32]But we're going to start with Ripper.
[01:33.55]Ripper is a game that has been requested a few times.
[01:40.13]Christopher Walken is in this game.
[01:44.42]Am I going to beat Dragon's Lair 2?
[01:46.20]I did.
[01:47.77]I beat Dragon's Lair 2.
[01:48.99]The final image from last night's stream was me pointing at the screen for about five seconds before the internet turned off.
[01:59.70]The game telling me, congratulations, you made it to the end, but you failed because you didn't get any treasures.
[02:05.44]So, I did, uh, I did complete it, though.
[02:11.19]I ain't doing that shit again.
[02:15.12]And we have that Kingdom game has a sequel.
[02:18.74]I have that too.
[02:19.42]I would put your seatbelt on for this one.
[02:25.70]Here we go.
[02:27.72]This is Ripper.
[02:34.56]Why don't we view the intro?
[02:41.29]We already got a scream face.
[02:42.65]That's a good start.
[02:46.19]And you know what?
[02:48.26]No, fuck it.
[02:48.80]I'll be right back.
[02:49.60]I'll be right back.
[02:50.28]Hold on.
[02:50.72]Just relax.
[02:51.50]I'll be right back.
[02:52.06]Everyone hold on.
[02:53.72]BRB within four minutes of the stream.
[02:55.21]Be right back.
[02:56.09]Just hold on.
[02:57.11]Wait, no.
[02:58.29]Just watch this.
[02:58.93]I'll be right back.
[02:59.47]Hold on.
[03:00.03]Fuck it.
[03:00.33]Hold on.
[04:04.22]Alright, I'm ready.
[04:04.84]You know how long it took me to get these fucking games to work?
[04:08.57]I deserve it.
[04:11.57]I deserve a fresh Coors Light.
[04:14.15]Yeah.
[04:15.01]That's... I don't even... I fucking hate beer.
[04:21.13]It's not good.
[04:21.97]It's really not.
[04:22.51]It's pretty bad.
[04:24.75]Alright, here we go!
[04:28.84]Are you ready for the intro?
[04:29.68]Uh-oh.
[04:31.50]Alright, you good?
[04:32.70]We good?
[04:34.55]You can hear it?
[04:35.64]Good.
[04:40.86]The VOD's already deleted.
[04:42.18]Great.
[04:42.64]That's fantastic.
[04:46.43]The VOD's already gone!
[04:48.51]No!
[04:49.21]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[04:52.67]I don't want to... I'm not having the mod get viewed.
[04:56.92]John Rhys-Davies is in this?
[05:02.27]You know the song.
[05:03.09]That's all that's happening.
[05:04.67]That's what's happening right now.
[05:06.17]Don't take my hand.
[05:09.11]Don't.
[05:31.74]I see, they can't, they can't get me now.
[05:35.91]Alright, Vaude is saved.
[05:48.85]No, I... I thought that was the end.
[06:00.88]Alright.
[06:04.92]Content ID, can't get it.
[06:10.65]Okay.
[06:10.85]My editor, Ben Dodds, called me at 3 AM to give me the news.
[06:34.20]It was a woman this time, the third victim.
[06:37.20]Of all the reporters in the city, the Ripper picked me to write to.
[06:39.96]Fix the screen.
[06:40.50]What's wrong with the screen?
[06:41.08]I knew that another mad letter to the city was soon to come, and I would run it on the front page of the virtual herald.
[06:47.41]I would let the world know the Ripper had killed again.
[06:51.37]The Ripper.
[06:53.52]So he jacked the Ripper?
[06:56.40]Oh, goddammit.
[07:01.22]Okay, that, yeah, we got it.
[07:04.56]Oh wait, that's right.
[07:05.30]What's wrong with the screen?
[07:06.80]It's still 400x300?
[07:07.88]The screen is down.
[07:10.64]What?
[07:11.24]Because that's when I full screen.
[07:16.84]Wait, what's it doing?
[07:19.70]Well, it's fixed because I went out of full screen.
[07:21.52]What's it doing?
[07:22.81]Give me like an exact explanation of what's happening.
[07:30.71]It's cropping it.
[07:31.41]Hold on, let me see.
[07:36.27]Can I get a good look?
[07:37.93]I see what's happening.
[07:38.97]I see what's happening.
[07:39.77]Hold on.
[07:40.15]Okay, hold on a second.
[07:40.97]I see what's happening here.
[07:43.21]Hold on.
[07:44.49]So I gotta move it up.
[07:48.83]I can look at it.
[07:49.43]I can see it right now.
[07:52.96]Look at that.
[07:55.54]Okay, hold on.
[07:56.72]I got it.
[07:58.06]The game may have crashed, but it's okay.
[08:01.73]This is gonna be close enough.
[08:07.09]I told you this is gonna be fucking crunchy.
[08:09.35]Some of you didn't believe me.
[08:10.17]People are like, what do you mean crunchy?
[08:13.47]What's that even mean?
[08:14.17]I love like crunchy candy, you know?
[08:16.38]Are you sure about that?
[08:17.06]Oh, come on.
[08:20.64]Alright, that's as good as it's gonna get.
[08:26.90]Let's go.
[08:31.70]Here we go.
[08:33.60]Start a new game.
[08:35.60]That should fix it.
[08:36.46]We're good.
[08:37.22]We got it.
[08:38.06]Alright.
[08:38.68]Start new game.
[08:42.86]Oh, for the love of fucking god.
[08:55.09]Can I skip this?
[08:57.47]It's louder this time.
[08:58.57]What if I click?
[09:00.67]Hold on.
[09:03.28]I'm gonna click.
[09:05.02]No.
[09:05.64]What about here?
[09:06.10]It's space.
[09:07.90]I think I crashed it.
[09:09.84]No, that's pause.
[09:11.74]Alright, hold on.
[09:12.64]Uh... I... Hey, how you doing?
[09:15.82]I, uh, hope you haven't eaten yet, Quinlan.
[09:21.16]What?
[09:24.51]Hmm.
[09:25.95]Figured you'd get here sooner or later, Quinlan.
[09:28.51]You can't get enough of this story, can you?
[09:30.91]I think everyone's had enough of this story, Magnata.
[09:36.67]Okay, here we go.
[09:37.87]So, there's been a murder.
[09:40.56]There's, uh... There's Christopher Walken, right?
[09:44.32]Yeah, Christopher Walken's in this game.
[09:47.24]Let's go ahead and go in here.
[09:50.14]This is a porn game.
[09:51.19]Uh, it is not.
[09:57.59]There's the man himself.
[10:00.23]Let's get some dialog.
[10:02.31]Don't go taking any souvenirs, Quinlan.
[10:06.91]Okay, ask about the modus operandi.
[10:09.07]Ask about the victim.
[10:09.90]Ask if Magnata has any clues.
[10:13.24]What's his name?
[10:13.72]Magnata?
[10:14.04]Do you have any clues?
[10:14.66]Do you have any clues?
[10:16.46]No sign of false entry.
[10:17.70]Nothing's disturbed.
[10:18.60]Two sets of prints.
[10:20.22]Hers and a mother's.
[10:21.74]It's him.
[10:22.01]The only thing not where it should be is this woman's insides.
[10:25.39]What about witnesses?
[10:26.75]I mean, this guy must have been a bloody mess.
[10:28.23]Even if it's three o'clock in the morning, it's Greenwich Village.
[10:30.77]Somebody must have seen him.
[10:32.05]Far as I know, he left us with one witness.
[10:34.50]And she's feeling a little fragmented at the moment.
[10:37.52]This guy is un-fucking-believable.
[10:40.52]Who's the swears in this game?
[10:44.23]Wow.
[10:44.61]Okay, why is the computer still on?
[10:45.67]Why is her computer on, Magnata?
[10:47.29]Well, it looks like she was in a public library node.
[10:50.35]Well, let me ask you a question.
[10:52.29]You got any mail lately?
[10:53.79]Maybe a little something from your pen pal?
[10:56.48]He writes after the fact, not before.
[10:58.28]You should know that, Magnata.
[11:00.30]I wouldn't hold out on you.
[11:01.46]Of course not.
[11:02.22]You've been very good about sharing what you know with me and several million other people.
[11:08.26]I should have busted you when you ran that first letter without letting us know about it.
[11:14.45]What?
[11:15.39]Whose letter?
[11:16.53]The murderer's letter?
[11:19.55]The game is a little quiet.
[11:20.55]I'll take care of that.
[11:21.43]Just hold on.
[11:23.73]I'll take care of that.
[11:25.75]Hold on a second.
[11:26.91]If I alt-tab, the whole thing goes down, I think.
[11:30.29]Hold on.
[11:31.81]Hold on.
[11:37.70]Alright, I got it up.
[11:40.86]Everybody relax.
[11:41.36]Are we good?
[11:42.16]I think we're good.
[11:46.28]Excuse me?
[11:47.18]Thank you.
[11:47.88]Okay.
[11:48.78]What about the victim?
[11:50.38]Who's the victim?
[11:51.82]Name's Stein.
[11:53.15]This guy has my hair.
[11:53.86]Alright, what about the modus operandi?
[12:14.40]No, he doesn't.
[12:15.02]Same M.O.
[12:15.50]as the others?
[12:16.26]You got it.
[12:16.98]Look around you, asshole.
[12:18.46]If anything, this is more gruesome than the other two.
[12:21.42]Hell of a lot more splatter.
[12:23.46]Look around you, asshole.
[12:24.52]Alright.
[12:25.76]Visiting hour's over.
[12:27.10]There's nothing here you haven't seen at the other murder sites except a few extra gallons of body fluids.
[12:32.47]Well, you shouldn't be touching anything, should you, Magnata?
[12:34.85]Hmm.
[12:37.51]Hey!
[12:37.79]I guess this case has me rattled.
[12:42.86]What, are you drinking out of the coffee cup?
[12:47.26]Why would you drink out of that coffee cup?
[12:52.24]What if there's, like, blood in it?
[12:53.50]Alright, what about in the fridge?
[12:55.23]No, wait.
[12:56.57]Alright, put it in the computer.
[12:59.23]Ah, that don't look right.
[13:03.53]That didn't look right at all.
[13:04.79]That looked a little strange.
[13:07.79]Alright.
[13:09.15]Object has been scanned into the database.
[13:11.97]Anything else I can do?
[13:17.44]Should I take a look at the blood?
[13:19.06]Or the computer?
[13:23.03]Filter.
[13:23.91]Sharpen.
[13:24.73]File.
[13:25.17]Edit.
[13:26.23]Images?
[13:28.13]Deckport interface.
[13:29.47]Tristech Agilware installed.
[13:33.37]Nothing?
[13:33.71]Can I press any buttons?
[13:39.06]I guess not.
[13:41.10]Oh, this... What does this get doing?
[13:46.95]Oh, he's got a camcorder.
[13:48.19]I was like, what is this guy doing?
[13:50.09]I don't know why I thought that was a microscope.
[13:53.65]I have no idea.
[13:54.29]Don't ask me why.
[13:57.01]Cold Carl Stasiak.
[13:59.31]We gotta stop meeting like this.
[14:03.61]Carl!
[14:08.05]Sorry, Quinlan.
[14:09.45]What'd you say?
[14:12.84]Any difference between the murder and the previous two?
[14:15.18]Ask him if any progress has been made in the investigation.
[14:19.00]If he has any idea what weapon, what kind of weapon is the Ripper using?
[14:21.85]Any idea what weapon he's using?
[14:23.43]Take a look at this mess.
[14:24.49]It has to be something big.
[14:26.61]A sword or a machete or something.
[14:29.13]Just can't cut through all that bone and muscle with a dagger.
[14:32.59]And the strength it would take to make a cut like that?
[14:35.38]He must be an enormous man.
[14:37.54]You know Vic Harley?
[14:38.66]Yeah, the pathologist over at the Medicoke.
[14:41.09]He knows a lot more about murder weapons than I do.
[14:43.93]You should talk to him.
[14:44.97]Alright, gonna talk to the guy at the, uh, okay.
[14:47.67]What about, did there any differences in the murders?
[14:49.93]Is there any difference between this murder and the previous ones?
[14:52.53]It was identical.
[14:53.99]Absolutely identical.
[14:55.58]It was a precision cut.
[14:57.42]A perfect line.
[14:59.32]And the way he empties out the body cavity.
[15:01.88]The way the organs are blown all around the room.
[15:04.66]So it's the same killer?
[15:06.12]Oh, for sure.
[15:07.51]This guy's outfit just screams wardrobe department.
[15:08.67]Pure evil, okay.
[15:32.87]Any progress?
[15:33.73]Any other progress?
[15:34.43]Any progress in the investigation?
[15:37.13]Who knows?
[15:38.23]Trying to get anything out of Magnata is next to impossible.
[15:41.61]Besides, if he does have a lead, you sure as hell never share it.
[15:45.57]He might lose his bounty if he does that.
[15:47.93]Well, you've been working with Magnata for years, Carl.
[15:50.29]What's your hunch?
[15:51.09]There's too many clothes.
[15:51.61]Well, something's bugging him.
[15:53.03]Who am I to talk?
[15:54.55]I'm having nightmares about this.
[15:56.05]The main character's doing a t-shirt challenge.
[15:57.53]I've been a forensic photographer for 22 years, and nothing's ever got to me like this.
[16:02.48]Now I can't sleep.
[16:04.08]You just need a vacation.
[16:05.16]That's all.
[16:05.76]Yeah.
[16:06.66]I hope you're right.
[16:08.12]Incoming whack transmission.
[16:09.96]Incoming whack transmission.
[16:12.16]Come in here.
[16:16.30]Hey, Catherine.
[16:17.74]Hey, Jake, how are things there?
[16:20.34]It's very... Shit is pretty whack.
[16:23.66]You're right.
[16:24.27]Just the name, Catherine.
[16:25.65]Listen, Jake, something's come up here.
[16:27.71]Something about the Ripper?
[16:28.96]Might be nothing.
[16:29.58]I don't know.
[16:29.94]It could be something big.
[16:30.88]Just wait for me at the newsroom and I'll let you know as soon as I find out.
[16:33.44]Wait for me at the newsroom?
[16:34.28]Now talk to me.
[16:34.78]What's going on?
[16:35.36]I have to go.
[16:36.40]Trust me.
[16:37.40]Who's in charge here?
[16:38.30]Well, after last night, I'd say that I am.
[16:42.76]So all of a sudden, you don't have to explain yourself to me?
[16:45.54]Look, if you don't hear from me in an hour, just go to my apartment and wait for me there.
[16:49.50]You can hang out with my crystals.
[16:50.76]Katherine!
[16:51.76]Hang out with my crystals?
[16:53.00]Shit.
[16:54.84]You mean hang out with your crystals.
[17:03.55]Should I save the game?
[17:04.23]Alright, save game in this slot.
[17:07.11]Got it.
[17:07.82]Save.
[17:08.12]Okay.
[17:10.66]I will forget that and I'll fuck it up.
[17:11.86]Alright, so let's go.
[17:15.26]So we're gonna go hang out with the... Is that another word for like cats or something?
[17:22.50]Newsroom.
[17:23.38]Alright.
[17:27.87]Here we go.
[17:29.41]What's going on, Ben?
[17:30.93]Did Catherine get a break in the Ripper story?
[17:33.33]I don't know, Jake.
[17:34.05]I thought you were the lead reporter in the story.
[17:36.07]Well, so did I. Do you know what she's up to?
[17:38.77]She's your assistant.
[17:40.14]You tell me.
[17:41.50]She ran out of yell like the place was on fire.
[17:44.74]Did another letter from the Ripper come in?
[17:47.16]No.
[17:47.60]You know he doesn't send them to anybody but you.
[17:51.10]Is it you?
[17:51.34]I guess we're just going to have to wait and see.
[17:53.75]Just tell me.
[17:54.51]Catherine and I met on the job.
[17:57.15]Despite reminding myself that mixing love and work can get messy, it didn't take long for it to become more than a professional relationship.
[18:04.75]I love all the fake stuff.
[18:05.80]You're not even typing on a real keyboard.
[18:07.78]But she was beginning to act like it was her story.
[18:11.08]I only hoped that whatever lead she had, she wasn't in it.
[18:14.70]That's how I type.
[18:15.60]That's the way I type.
[18:16.48]See?
[18:17.58]Incoming whack transmission.
[18:19.48]Fucking whack.
[18:23.35]Dear boss, have you seen my work this morning yet?
[18:27.11]Your stories make the cops seem so confident.
[18:31.16]None of you know how I do it.
[18:32.88]You never will.
[18:35.28]You shouldn't let your girlfriend do your work for you.
[18:38.42]She is close to me.
[18:45.07]My next job.
[18:48.26]She gets it today.
[18:49.38]The story's all yours.
[18:51.36]It was truly Ripper.
[18:56.12]It's Bugleberry.
[18:57.76]Catherine.
[18:58.70]What was he looking at?
[18:59.38]Where are you going?
[19:00.55]That was a cigarette holder.
[19:03.23]Usually it takes an hour to cross that part of Manhattan.
[19:06.05]I did it in 20 minutes, propelled by kicking myself in the ass for letting Catherine go out alone.
[19:11.27]What?
[19:11.72]I was scared as hell when I got there, but...
[19:14.03]Everything looked okay in her apartment.
[19:16.67]Until Catherine showed up, that is.
[19:18.61]Okay, until... Catherine, what is going on here?
[19:20.85]This is her apartment?
[19:22.17]Where is this?
[19:22.92]Catherine, what is... What's with this, like, Dracula apartment?
[19:25.36]What the f... What is wrong?
[19:27.84]What happened?
[19:28.44]She's been stabbed.
[19:30.24]What?
[19:30.74]No, no, no, Catherine.
[19:31.52]No!
[19:31.68]Catherine, no.
[19:31.96]Catherine, fuck.
[19:34.62]Catherine, please, Catherine.
[19:36.96]Fuck!
[19:42.38]what hold on wait why is this so why are we getting good news was Catherine wasn't dead the bad news was that she was in a coma deeper than anyone thought possible what happened the ever helpful detective magnata had her brought to the tribeca center for cyber studies also known as the metacog meanwhile I stopped off at the police station to see a few sources and try to retrieve Catherine's portable whack tick horrible whack she'll have left me a message
[20:12.61]Alright, so we're gonna... She's in a coma.
[20:15.34]Yeah, but why did she go into a coma?
[20:17.44]Alright, we're looking for the portable whack device.
[20:28.78]Looks like we're gonna talk to this guy.
[20:36.32]Finish this game or riot?
[20:38.18]Um... We'll see.
[20:42.60]We'll see, because once we get to, like, the second or third disk change I have to do, good luck.
[20:49.20]I've got them.
[20:50.48]But I don't know if that shit's gonna work.
[20:58.17]Who's that?
[21:00.45]Hey, Quinlan.
[21:02.57]The Ripper strikes again.
[21:03.75]I guess we'll be seeing your work on the front page again.
[21:07.31]Another body and another byline.
[21:09.41]You know, if you just catch this guy, Brandon, I could go back to writing the police blotter on page 12.
[21:13.38]Sorry to hear about your partner.
[21:16.78]What is that?
[21:17.22]She was a nice girl.
[21:19.54]I liked him when she came around here.
[21:21.22]She used to come down here?
[21:23.01]Came down here all the time.
[21:24.17]She used to do your legwork.
[21:26.91]Right, right.
[21:27.69]I just... Was it the same guy?
[21:29.93]I can't do everything, can I?
[21:33.77]Alright, any clues?
[21:34.97]Uh, I need... I need the WAC device.
[21:39.72]Remote Magnata.
[21:40.68]I'll tell you, Lou.
[21:42.64]Magnata wasn't all two together at the murder site.
[21:46.00]It's lucky for you.
[21:47.42]No, I'm serious.
[21:48.14]There was this one strange thing.
[21:51.63]Strange?
[21:53.59]Yeah, I mean, if I didn't know any better, I'd say that he intentionally destroyed a piece of evidence.
[22:00.59]It won't be the first time.
[22:02.47]What?
[22:03.57]He's done it before?
[22:04.19]Yeah, he hides it, he destroys it, he withholds it, you name it.
[22:09.03]This is common knowledge.
[22:10.39]Yeah, he's like king shit at a bounty collecting and the chief gets a piece of it.
[22:14.31]I mean, what are you going to do?
[22:15.85]You know how this place works.
[22:19.16]Really?
[22:19.74]Okay.
[22:22.14]I think it's time to clean up the department.
[22:27.04]Any clues from the library?
[22:27.90]What about the library?
[22:29.46]That was the last place Stein was seen alive.
[22:32.76]Standard operating procedures to copy all libraries.
[22:37.04]C-space files, that kind of stuff.
[22:42.23]How can I get my hands on what they found?
[22:43.93]Hell, Quinlan, it's a public library.
[22:47.01]We just copied the files.
[22:49.39]Everything's still there.
[22:50.35]What?
[22:53.11]Okay, we gotta go to the library.
[22:56.53]Forensics come up with anything yet?
[22:59.05]Apparently, this pathologist over at the Medicog, he's come up with this theory.
[23:04.60]He thinks that the Ripper may have been using nanomachines to do it.
[23:09.56]No, God.
[23:11.42]Not nanomachines.
[23:14.84]Not nanomachines.
[23:16.06]You know, Lou, I think it's time I bribe a photographer.
[23:21.44]Where's Stasiak?
[23:23.24]He's in Wyoming.
[23:24.42]Oh, come on, Brandon.
[23:25.74]He's the only guy I haven't really talked to.
[23:27.76]You never know what he might have picked up on.
[23:29.42]Yeah, well, that's the problem.
[23:30.66]He picked up on too much.
[23:32.54]I'm not kidding with you.
[23:33.36]He went to Wyoming.
[23:34.89]The case was too much for him, and he took a leave of absence.
[23:37.97]Stasiak, cold Carl Stasiak.
[23:40.19]Yeah, get this.
[23:41.65]After the Stein murder, his wife calls and says, Carl needed a little vacation.
[23:46.93]Carl.
[23:47.25]No, that was it.
[23:48.51]He just got up, no goodbyes, no nothing.
[23:51.23]He didn't even give me a call.
[23:57.34]Okay.
[23:58.70]Thanks for the info.
[24:00.76]Let's go.
[24:05.97]It's always weird when they put, like, CG, and I use that term very loosely here, but when you're an actor in a world that is created in 3D with old 3D technology, it's weird.
[24:19.06]It's scary.
[24:20.70]Like, this shit's creepy.
[24:23.99]That old style of 3D mapping with the actors and shit.
[24:28.29]It's fucking bizarre.
[24:33.96]What's over here?
[24:40.74]Yeah, it's like mist.
[24:43.62]Detective Vincent.
[24:44.90]There it is.
[24:45.28]Okay, Magnato.
[24:47.61]Why do we have offices like this?
[24:51.81]Where are we?
[24:52.47]What year is it supposed to be?
[24:58.36]I don't get it.
[24:59.06]It's 2040.
[24:59.74]It said the year.
[25:04.84]Well, that's too busy fucking muting VODs.
[25:07.53]Can I take one?
[25:17.61]Anything else down here?
[25:22.58]Oh, hold on.
[25:22.94]I can open up my whack device.
[25:26.08]Object scanned into database.
[25:30.40]what is it uh arrest report I can't read this violation of city penal code detective arresting officer detective Vincent mcnada purpose observed at 1 45 a.m at the corner of Washington discharging submitted I had a taser to disable two members of this riding zugs
[25:54.65]a rage gang a captain from 40 feet with a sleeper bullet and called for a cleanup alright well I got it scanned so let's see if it's can I go on his computer I don't think so let's get out of here it's gonna be standing right there sitting on the couch
[26:34.41]Wasn't I supposed to find her whack device?
[26:44.04]Can I go anywhere else?
[26:45.60]Wait, what about this way?
[26:47.26]What is down there?
[26:55.44]Over there?
[26:57.70]Please stop the bongos.
[26:59.06]I can't.
[27:00.26]They can't be stopped.
[27:03.34]Go over here.
[27:06.82]No, I'm just spinning around.
[27:09.43]I want to go in this room.
[27:11.29]Is this the evidence chamber?
[27:14.09]Fucking stop them.
[27:14.91]I can't stop them.
[27:17.11]I cannot deter.
[27:18.17]I can't turn the bongos off.
[27:20.23]Evidence room.
[27:20.67]Here we are.
[27:25.34]Welcome to the evidence chamber.
[27:26.58]What can I help you with, buddy?
[27:30.20]Oh, Christ.
[27:31.65]What do you want?
[27:32.57]Some respect, Spankowski.
[27:34.21]You know, you really shouldn't talk to me like that.
[27:36.49]I shouldn't be talking to you at all, you goddamn leech.
[27:39.88]What do you want?
[27:40.50]Some of us got to work for a living.
[27:42.44]Right.
[27:45.88]I want to see evidence from the Katherine Powell case, please.
[27:48.23]I need the evidence in the Powell case.
[27:50.03]No way, Quinlan.
[27:51.31]That could be my job.
[27:54.10]Alright, time to convince.
[27:55.62]Bluff him.
[27:56.18]Tell him Magnata said it's alright to see the evidence.
[27:59.54]Let's go with the bluff.
[28:00.78]Let's see, can I get him with my... Do I have enough charisma to do this?
[28:03.49]Uh-oh.
[28:17.18]Didn't work.
[28:19.58]Didn't work.
[28:20.85]Not good.
[28:22.05]Look, Quinlan.
[28:23.85]I told you everything I know.
[28:24.69]Now will you get the hell out of here before you get me in trouble?
[28:29.19]Look, Quinlan.
[28:31.01]I told you everything I know.
[28:31.83]Now will you get the hell out of here before you get me in trouble?
[28:34.48]I still don't understand the thing around the necks.
[28:39.32]Well, I obviously need to find a way to convince him to give me the evidence.
[28:45.10]Let's go.
[28:45.84]Let's go.
[28:49.94]That's a police badge.
[28:51.70]Is it?
[28:51.95]Alright, let's see if I... Did I unlock any new areas?
[29:01.05]What about that way?
[29:09.18]Turn the music off?
[29:12.02]No, I'm not going to turn the music off.
[29:14.74]You'll be fine.
[29:15.76]There we go.
[29:16.46]Police station.
[29:17.16]Tribeca Center.
[29:19.03]Alright.
[29:19.75]Catherine Powell's apartment newsroom.
[29:22.73]Let's go to... Uh, I was supposed to meet somebody at the newsroom, right?
[29:28.65]Let's go here.
[29:30.46]Oh, shit!
[29:58.36]Well, it looks like we're never going to go to the newsroom.
[30:08.31]Metacog.
[30:08.89]Uh-huh.
[30:09.53]Hold on.
[30:10.51]Metacog.
[30:11.07]Uh-huh.
[30:11.83]Hold on.
[30:13.37]Metacog.
[30:14.03]Hold on.
[30:15.07]I, like, brought all the footage.
[30:16.57]Beg your pardon?
[30:17.19]I thought it was going to work.
[30:19.52]I said, can I help you?
[30:21.12]What'd you think I said?
[30:23.66]Nothing.
[30:24.06]I...
[30:25.39]I'm looking for whoever's taking care of my girlfriend, Catherine Powell.
[30:29.01]That would be Dr. Burton.
[30:30.53]Take the elevator to the second floor and make a right.
[30:33.32]If she's not there, go to ICU down the hall from there.
[30:36.34]Whatever you do, don't stand too close to her.
[30:39.08]Why is that?
[30:39.56]A little chilly.
[30:42.32]What?
[30:43.36]Right.
[30:43.76]Uh, alright.
[30:48.83]Let's just go up here.
[30:51.49]Elevator and to the right.
[30:58.53]That's a scary looking place.
[31:03.63]Is this a scary game?
[31:05.33]It might be.
[31:15.75]That's... I don't know.
[31:17.01]It could be.
[31:23.97]I gotta go up.
[31:25.41]Ward's Lobby Morgue.
[31:27.66]Let's go to the... Ward?
[31:37.92]What is going on?
[31:38.80]Oh, yeah.
[31:42.53]Uh... Okay, that scared the shit out of me.
[31:47.43]That actually did.
[31:48.03]I thought it was like a scream.
[31:50.95]And then to the right.
[32:07.58]Is this supposed to be scary?
[32:08.82]I don't know.
[32:09.24]I can't tell.
[32:10.80]This might be a part where it's going to be scary.
[32:12.88]There's nothing even over there.
[32:20.58]Oh, there she is.
[32:25.46]Alright, so... What are you doing here?
[32:31.79]My name's Jake Quinlan.
[32:32.63]I'm a friend of Catherine's.
[32:34.61]Quinlan?
[32:37.73]Yeah, okay.
[32:39.17]How is Catherine?
[32:39.85]Is she going to be alright?
[32:41.31]It doesn't look good.
[32:42.99]Her consciousness is deeply withdrawn.
[32:45.37]Where is she?
[32:46.03]Withdrawn?
[32:46.53]What's that mean?
[32:47.59]It means her mental processes, her memory, the basic building blocks of her personality are inaccessible.
[32:54.69]You mean she's in there, but you can't reach her?
[32:57.01]That's a best case scenario.
[32:59.07]We haven't yet diagnosed her psychic damage.
[33:12.44]How did the Ripper do this?
[33:14.12]It's hard to tell.
[33:15.68]She had some minor contusions on her head.
[33:17.62]Nothing fatal, but you never know with head injuries.
[33:20.42]We won't know anything until we can get a data angel in there to do some investigating.
[33:23.88]A data angel?
[33:24.54]You can get a data angel into the consciousness of someone in a coma?
[33:27.80]I'm not sending anyone in there until I've had a chance to fully map her psychic damage.
[33:32.15]Let me get in there.
[33:32.85]Now, if you don't mind.
[33:41.82]Alright, well, what are you doing for her?
[33:42.98]What are you doing for her?
[33:44.42]I'm not doing anything for her as long as I'm standing here talking to you.
[33:48.26]Why don't you let me get back to work?
[33:51.86]So I have to go in there on my own, then.
[33:54.45]Well, is she going to be alright?
[33:56.37]It doesn't look good.
[33:57.93]She's still in triage.
[34:00.03]We're going to just have to wait and see.
[34:01.49]Well, what are you doing?
[34:05.79]Let me get in there.
[34:06.47]Can I at least see?
[34:07.71]Wait, there's another person in here.
[34:11.56]You here to check on Miss Powell?
[34:12.63]Miss Powell's new money.
[34:14.09]She looks pretty bad.
[34:15.81]Is there anything you can do for her?
[34:17.45]She's in good hands.
[34:18.97]And she'll be in even better hands once Dr. Burtman allows us to treat her.
[34:24.09]Where's Dr. Burtman?
[34:37.68]Let me in there.
[34:40.15]Is there something I can take?
[34:41.17]Is there anything else I can do in here?
[34:43.35]I don't think I can do anything else in this room.
[34:53.17]No, alright.
[34:54.46]I gotta go to the doctor.
[34:55.32]Let's find the doctor's office.
[34:59.44]Insert disk two.
[35:01.08]I will.
[35:01.38]I'll try.
[35:01.82]I have to save the game.
[35:04.18]I have to restart the game.
[35:13.79]Guys, I'm running this game through like four different virtual layers, okay?
[35:18.11]I'm on my computer, and then from my computer to a virtual machine, from the virtual machine to a DOS emulation, from an emulation through the disk.
[35:32.46]Sorry, I just bumped you.
[35:38.64]And then through VPN.
[35:45.75]What is going on over here?
[35:49.45]Jump scare.
[35:49.99]Jump scare.
[35:50.47]Jump scare.
[35:50.89]Jump scare.
[35:51.31]Do it!
[35:54.17]Oh, it's a wet floor.
[35:55.07]I can't go over here.
[35:56.01]No, that's what these are here for.
[36:04.16]I can't go this way.
[36:10.36]Wait.
[36:11.48]Locked.
[36:12.40]Damn.
[36:17.74]What the fuck do you have?
[36:18.52]Remote control.
[36:28.99]I can turn the game down from in my inventory.
[36:32.19]Okay.
[36:34.17]I don't want to press the power button.
[36:37.37]Oh, here we go.
[36:39.99]Cool.
[36:40.31]Alright.
[36:41.25]I don't want to... How do I turn this?
[36:43.98]No, don't reset the game.
[36:44.96]Just turn this off.
[36:47.25]Okay.
[36:49.63]Inventory.
[36:50.93]Use.
[36:52.27]Done.
[36:53.99]Alright, save game.
[36:56.17]Right here.
[36:56.97]Overwrite.
[36:58.17]Save it.
[37:00.69]Okay.
[37:00.91]I'm gonna turn around.
[37:10.82]There's nothing else over here.
[37:17.10]The game- this game low-key sucks.
[37:25.35]Just wait a second.
[37:32.69]We need to go to the other place.
[37:36.05]This game low-key sucks.
[37:37.93]We're gonna go to the morgue.
[37:44.21]I'm gonna try the other disk.
[37:51.65]But not yet.
[37:51.99]We don't have to do that yet.
[37:52.75]There we are.
[38:02.89]Alright.
[38:07.23]This combat in this game... Guys, don't you want to at least see the combat?
[38:11.87]Don't you want to see Christopher Walken go, well, at least one more time before we end this?
[38:17.92]Don't you want to see that?
[38:19.22]Don't you want to know?
[38:21.12]I kind of need to know.
[38:26.00]I have to beat this game.
[38:31.42]There's combat.
[38:33.26]What is going on?
[38:34.56]Is it just a pair of legs?
[38:35.54]What the fuck is that?
[38:41.53]Is that Paul Giamatti again?
[38:42.61]Hey, Vic.
[38:44.13]What's for lunch?
[38:44.85]Hey, Quinlan.
[38:46.05]Oh.
[38:46.73]What the fuck?
[38:48.95]They working you hard?
[38:51.59]Working me like crazy these days.
[38:53.15]Hey, is this Renee Stein?
[38:55.15]Are you kidding?
[38:56.93]You were at the crime scene.
[38:58.59]You saw her inside splattered everywhere.
[39:01.78]Yeah, I guess I did.
[39:03.63]Can you take the cigarette out of your mouth before you talk to me, please?
[39:10.45]Low key TOS.
[39:35.08]Fuck.
[39:35.20]Any luck figuring out the Ripper's weapon yet?
[39:36.75]What's the weapon?
[39:37.17]I'm completely stumped.
[39:38.43]Nanomachines.
[39:39.25]I did every test on these stiffs.
[39:41.45]I mean, a computer crossmatched the wounds with every kind of blade imaginable.
[39:45.23]Nothing.
[39:45.57]I mean, it's like a cross between a Vegematic and a diamond cutter.
[39:49.30]What's with the thing on his head?
[39:50.18]Something must have cut these people open.
[39:51.74]These computers combined.
[39:52.46]What's with the miner's helmet?
[39:53.56]You don't believe me?
[39:54.54]Look at those control panels by the steps.
[39:56.74]Doctors don't have those.
[39:58.80]What is that?
[40:00.64]He's got blood on his hands, and he's, like, putting it on his mouth.
[40:04.46]You hear about my partner?
[40:06.04]Who's that?
[40:07.10]Catherine Powell.
[40:08.37]She was attacked by the Ripper.
[40:09.47]Somehow she got away.
[40:11.00]She's upstairs in a coma.
[40:12.56]Dr. Burton's treating her.
[40:14.06]Oh, that's supposed to be the future, right.
[40:15.72]Burton's a good doctor.
[40:17.63]And if she gets stuck, she'll probably call in her secret weapon.
[40:20.89]What's that?
[40:21.33]A guy named Joey Falconetti.
[40:25.02]Joey Falconetti.
[40:25.96]Joey Falconetti.
[40:29.08]Okay.
[40:30.16]Who's that?
[40:30.76]Who's Joey Falconetti?
[40:32.32]Cyberspace expert that Burton uses on all our tough cases.
[40:35.80]Also known by his old C-space handle, Falconetti.
[40:38.36]Get it?
[40:39.16]Crazy guy.
[40:40.48]Likes looking at the bodies.
[40:42.06]I'm surprised she hasn't called him in yet to look at your friend.
[40:44.15]What do you mean?
[40:45.31]Oh, he keeps doing it.
[40:47.43]Stop doing that.
[40:48.81]She usually calls him in on that kind of stuff.
[40:50.87]Alright, now it would have been funny if they had a take where he put it up into his mouth and went like, and then just kept talking.
[41:00.08]Where can I find this falcon, Eddie?
[41:02.92]Difficult guy to find.
[41:05.00]Burton usually goes to a guy named Gambit Nelson.
[41:07.91]He passes the time at the Café du Champ.
[41:10.47]Café du Champ, okay.
[41:12.19]Du Champ.
[41:13.49]You can find him there.
[41:14.35]Let's see how many, let's see what disk that requires.
[41:18.17]I got new locations.
[41:21.47]Let's see if I can like boot the second disk and like load from there.
[41:24.79]If not, then, well...
[41:28.98]I tapped the nerve memory of this victim and fed it into the simulator so that I could reenact the attack.
[41:35.20]Million dollar piece of hardware.
[41:37.06]And look what it gives me.
[41:39.84]Jesus.
[41:41.38]Looks like she swallowed a fucking grenade.
[41:46.80]I... Whose mind are we looking at?
[41:48.00]Here's an isolation of just one of the organs from this body.
[41:51.34]The lines indicate the many cuts made for this body.
[41:55.36]The sheer number of cuts isn't the only amazing thing, though.
[41:57.70]Watch this.
[41:58.18]A heart?
[42:00.09]All of those cuts happen simultaneously.
[42:03.62]Human hands can't move that fast.
[42:05.38]So the ripper is... And it was like this for every... He's got, like, powers or something.
[42:09.74]He's got technological powers.
[42:11.10]Notice the path of the cut.
[42:12.78]Not one centimeter offline.
[42:14.84]Like a seam was undone.
[42:16.24]Mouth of second discipline.
[42:17.06]No human can have done that.
[42:18.42]Because humans aren't strong enough?
[42:20.02]Does that work?
[42:20.62]Does that work?
[42:21.72]He's cutting through skin, muscle, bone.
[42:24.43]No way this cut could be so neat.
[42:26.51]I'll tell you what else is weird.
[42:27.91]There were no traces of fabric in the wood.
[42:32.15]Oh, we're good.
[42:34.37]First layer.
[42:35.75]Peel back the fucking onion skin.
[42:38.35]Second layer.
[42:39.36]That's where we are.
[42:40.32]That you are here.
[42:41.68]That's where the DOS is being implemented into the virtual machine.
[42:46.20]Layer three is mounting the disk.
[42:48.78]The disk is layer fucking four.
[42:51.91]I'm gonna try it.
[42:57.95]Did he lose disk two?
[42:59.01]Yeah, what you guys don't understand is, you know, I bought this game and it only came for the first disk.
[43:04.65]I got scammed.
[43:05.51]I'm just, you know, gonna be real with you.
[43:17.42]Nice Shrek metaphor.
[43:18.62]What the fuck is a Shrek metaphor mean?
[43:25.31]Alright, I'm going to try it.
[43:27.05]I got my pathing correct.
[43:31.97]The onions.
[43:34.31]Does he do an onion thing?
[43:37.85]I'm like an onion.
[43:38.76]Donkey, I'm like an onion.
[43:40.80]I've got this layer.
[43:42.30]Oh, he does do that.
[43:43.08]You're right.
[43:43.46]Fuck.
[43:43.80]Whatever.
[43:46.57]Alright, so when I ask for the disk, we mount the second disk, and then we press enter.
[43:52.89]And then I press okay.
[43:54.39]Oh, it's gonna be fucking amazing.
[43:58.84]Look at, okay, newsroom.
[44:03.74]Okay, hold on here.
[44:07.48]Let's get this correct.
[44:17.31]So.
[44:20.71]Newsroom.
[44:24.71]Insert disk 2 into drive D. I can't get back out there though.
[44:32.30]I can't get... Eject it.
[44:42.86]Eject.
[44:45.18]Oh god, hurry.
[44:52.50]Do that in this menu.
[44:57.87]Hold on.
[44:58.15]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[44:59.67]Hold on.
[45:03.00]I gotta get a bigger screen here.
[45:03.94]Hold on.
[45:04.20]I'm gonna stay here.
[45:09.96]Quick, inject it.
[45:12.15]This is where we're gonna... This is how I can tell if this is gonna work.
[45:18.14]Okay, everybody relax.
[45:19.97]Don't, nobody move.
[45:22.03]Don't fucking move.
[45:23.71]Okay?
[45:28.16]Nobody move.
[45:30.74]Don't move.
[45:36.65]Action.
[45:37.01]Okay, here we go.
[45:54.14]Everybody relax.
[46:00.71]Where is it?
[46:16.12]Shit.
[46:17.96]Hold on.
[46:32.96]I'll just come in!
[46:54.23]Fuck!
[46:56.51]I know I should've got an expert to help me!
[47:12.97]Okay.
[47:20.25]Ladies and gentlemen, we're coming back.
[47:21.43]Here we go.
[47:24.39]Bingo.
[47:25.73]You didn't think I fucking had it in me, did you?
[47:28.97]You didn't think I fucking had it in me.
[47:31.86]I do.
[47:33.02]We're on disk two.
[47:33.74]You didn't think I had it in me.
[47:43.39]Now do I do restore game or continue game?
[48:14.62]It's okay.
[48:15.28]It's okay.
[48:16.24]We're gonna... Shit.
[48:30.10]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[48:31.96]When mounting multiple images, you can then switch between the amount of distance by pressing control F4.
[48:41.37]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[48:42.01]Hold on a second, guys.
[48:42.99]Guys.
[48:44.92]Mounting multiple images.
[48:46.68]Let's do it.
[48:47.48]Let's go.
[48:53.22]That's not an Alt-F4 joke.
[48:54.56]It's not.
[48:55.20]Alright, mounting multiple... How do I mount... I need a DOS cool person to save me right now.
[49:02.09]This game has seven disks.
[49:05.67]It's gotta be mounted in the same drive.
[49:06.71]It is.
[49:06.91]We're good.
[49:08.83]How do I mount multiple... It's mount extra...
[49:16.41]It's on DOSBox.
[49:25.17]You can't.
[49:32.80]I can't?
[49:35.16]No.
[49:38.24]Delete C Windows system 32.
[49:44.38]I use Daemon tools.
[49:48.15]We'll go back to that when I get a DOS person.
[49:53.25]It's okay, because we're moving on.
[49:55.41]We're moving on to this one.
[50:03.82]Do a full stream on Ripper.
[50:05.14]I'm going to go back to Ripper.
[50:12.24]Let's open it up.
[50:18.22]We're going to go from there.
[50:19.16]We're going to go on to Kingdom 2.
[50:24.98]Wait, somebody's got it.
[50:26.58]Is that correct?
[50:30.50]Like, is that correct?
[50:31.94]Sawdust Bunnies, is that correct?
[50:35.62]Is that the correct way that I do this?
[50:36.78]Just mount them all in the same place.
[50:38.29]Just mount them all.
[50:39.83]Just mount them all.
[50:42.07]Just type it and just mount them all.
[50:47.93]Just list them all in one command.
[50:49.51]And then it's Ctrl-F4, right?
[50:53.78]Hold on, stay right there.
[50:55.24]I'm going to try that.
[51:07.59]Don't accidentally press Alt-F4.
[51:12.37]I tried to do this before, too.
[51:16.06]This is not going to end well.
[51:18.24]I have to move on.
[51:22.24]Just install Windows.
[51:23.54]I tried to run this through a virtual machine and I fucking couldn't get it to work.
[51:31.83]Alright.
[51:34.51]I gotta move on.
[51:35.39]I have to.
[51:35.73]This is going to take too long.
[51:39.22]I'm going to try this one time and we're going to see what happens.
[51:48.08]I gotta get this on the screen so we can tell me if I'm doing it right.
[51:50.44]This is the one time I'm gonna try this.
[51:55.70]Tell me.
[51:57.54]This is a troubleshooting stream.
[51:59.44]Fuck.
[52:00.12]Troubleshooting stream.
[52:01.08]You ready?
[52:03.12]So, all of the disks are in this folder called FMV.
[52:08.78]Welcome to the stream.
[52:10.48]Hey, everybody.
[52:11.10]How are you?
[52:12.36]Okay, so.
[52:15.50]That's the drive that it's in.
[52:20.37]Okay.
[52:21.19]They're all in there.
[52:22.87]RIP 1, RIP 2, RIP 3, RIP 4, RIP 5.
[52:24.69]I already screwed it up.
[52:27.45]It's image mount.
[52:37.47]Alright, so that's that.
[52:39.53]That's that, right?
[52:47.90]I'm hacking with Two Fingers.
[52:49.33]I am.
[52:49.63]You're right.
[52:50.15]I absolutely am.
[52:52.53]Okay.
[52:53.67]Is this correct?
[52:55.07]Somebody has an image of this.
[52:57.61]Somebody has an image of this.
[52:58.61]Let me see.
[53:05.32]This is not going to do anything.
[53:11.16]This is not an image.
[53:12.62]Why did you link this?
[53:14.40]I need help.
[53:16.73]I need fucking help.
[53:19.15]I need not this, I need help.
[53:32.48]Alright, somebody help me.
[53:35.10]If I do this for all of them and then I do dash T dash ISO, is this gonna work?
[53:44.11]No, stop laughing.
[53:45.99]Stop laughing.
[53:46.65]Everybody, I need people to stop laughing.
[53:48.17]I need help.
[53:49.23]I'm gonna do, so is this correct?
[53:54.97]Just end it.
[53:55.71]Okay, hold on.
[54:05.03]Okay, that's, then there's, then there's four.
[54:09.11]Stop, everyone stop laughing.
[54:10.41]I can't see the chat.
[54:21.20]Stop laughing!
[54:22.54]Stop laughing at me!
[54:33.43]Okay, here we go.
[54:34.39]And there's enough.
[54:37.25]There's six fucking disks.
[54:38.89]God damn it.
[54:41.31]I even was gonna buy like an old Macintosh computer on eBay.
[54:46.93]But the description said that the screen was broken and that I needed to bring it to a repair shop.
[54:52.07]It was gonna be like $1,200.
[54:54.75]So I didn't do it.
[55:02.39]Okay, here we go.
[55:11.22]Okay.
[55:13.28]Ladies and gentlemen, is this going to work?
[55:14.72]Will that do it?
[55:15.30]And then I need to, I need a computer programmer in the chat to tell me that's going to work.
[55:20.30]Do you have computer programming skills?
[55:22.52]No, that's not going to work.
[55:32.35]I'm an IT major.
[55:33.71]It won't work.
[55:35.21]Look at this link.
[55:35.80]Look at this link.
[55:36.26]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[55:37.50]Stop, stop slapping.
[55:38.70]Stop writing text.
[55:43.80]It's possible to mount more than one image in it, okay?
[55:45.82]ImageMount.com Why is it .com?
[55:52.65].com?
[55:56.05]Why does it say ImageMount.com?
[56:06.23]Like that.
[56:14.71]You put an extra... I'm a DOS major and I guarantee it'll absolutely work.
[56:20.15]Trust me.
[56:20.67]Open the link.
[56:22.43]There's a typo.
[56:24.73]No, there's not.
[56:25.57]There's no typo.
[56:26.75]There's an extra rip.
[56:27.83]Where?
[56:29.31]Shit.
[56:30.87]No.
[56:31.13]Fuck.
[56:33.44]Okay, hold on.
[56:33.92]Wait, wait, wait.
[56:34.78]Is it imagebound.com?
[56:41.36]Oh, god damn it.
[56:47.97]ImageMount.com.
[56:48.94]Alright, ImageMount.com.
[56:58.44]I did it right.
[56:59.04]I did it right the first time.
[57:00.04]I need a computer analyst to explain this to me.
[57:02.50]ImageMount.com.
[57:04.16]D-E.
[57:07.12]To the tutorial for you.
[57:08.42]And people are writing so much.
[57:13.84]That code will...
[57:19.08]That code is going to break your computer.
[57:26.16]No.
[57:26.48]Alright.
[57:26.82]So hold on.
[57:27.24]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[57:28.04]So I need somebody to tell me.
[57:31.92]I'm going to put it on emote only mode and I'm going to pull.
[57:39.06]If I, okay.
[57:39.58]Now, if I continue to do this, will it work?
[57:43.68]Did I have it right the first time?
[57:48.93]I had it right the first time.
[57:53.93]Read the guide.
[57:54.63]Just look at Doc's box wiki.
[57:57.67]It's not .com.
[58:02.72]So I had it right the first time.
[58:09.44]More than one image.
[58:11.26]Yes, I know.
[58:11.76]Okay, so remember, E is what I have as my C drive.
[58:17.51]Right?
[58:18.49]So I just have to do everything that I did normally.
[58:20.39]So image mount, space D, all the stuff, and then dash T space CD-ROM.
[58:27.68]Is that correct?
[58:32.90]That's correct?
[58:35.24]Oh, let's go.
[58:36.18]Let's go.
[58:51.74]Let's go.
[58:52.10]How do you say let's go when you're doing shell command?
[58:57.42]I don't understand how you... This is why you keep programmings too hard.
[59:05.39]E-F-M-V slash rip1.iso.
[59:11.55]Then the next one, right?
[59:12.55]Dude, let's go.
[59:27.07]I'm so stupid.
[59:32.27]Okay.
[59:33.45]Check my work while I go, please.
[59:48.36]Okay.

[59:55.92]Why does this look so fucked up?
[59:56.82]What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened?
[60:18.21]Why did it do that?
[60:18.67]I can't go back.
[60:19.01]What?
[60:19.11]I can only do one line?
[60:23.72]No, it was a different line.
[60:25.52]No, I have to go.
[60:33.93]Hold on.
[60:37.10]Oh, sh... Everybody stop talking.

[61:30.45]I can't imagine.
[61:31.23]This is why they get paid the big bucks.
[61:38.78]D, E, okay, that's correct.
[61:40.82]I'm gonna do this as we go.
[61:42.18]E, rip2.iso, space, E.
[61:50.17]fmvrip3.iso Don't get it wrong.
[61:56.20]Okay.
[61:57.42]That's all correct.
[61:59.26]E fmvrip4.iso Okay.
[62:08.35]That's correct so far.
[62:12.91]Space E FMV
[62:18.50]rip5.iso done space e slash FMV rip6.iso done dash t iso is this correct do I press enter this will do it this is gonna work
[62:45.92]I'm seeing a lot of yeses.
[62:47.08]I'm seeing a lot of yeses.
[62:47.96]A lot of them.
[63:02.28]Did it work?
[63:03.76]Did it work?
[63:05.86]Did it work?
[63:08.84]Is that it?
[63:09.32]Do I not touch anything?

[63:48.68]What happened?
[63:59.14]What happened?
[64:05.13]What happened?
[64:22.45]Get this fucking thing off the screen!
[64:31.52]Okay.
[64:33.74]What if I do Ctrl F4?
[64:35.70]Right?
[64:35.90]That puts me on another disk.
[64:36.96]I could be on disk one.
[64:40.99]Okay, disk two of six is now active.
[64:56.67]Hold on.
[64:59.96]What the fuck did I do?
[65:04.12]I need disk 1.
[65:04.64]Control F4.
[65:10.31]Disk 3 is now active.
[65:12.43]Disk 4 is now active.
[65:14.65]Disk 5.
[65:14.99]Disk 6.
[65:15.41]Disk 1 is now active.
[65:25.65]Disk 1 is in.
[65:26.37]It's in there.
[65:46.18]It works.
[65:47.28]But does it work?
[65:48.90]Combat medium.
[65:54.27]It worked.
[65:55.97]Everybody chill the fuck out.
[65:57.83]Everybody, everybody... Wait.
[66:00.94]Wait, hold on.
[66:02.72]I think I got it.
[66:03.58]I think I got it.
[66:06.96]We're moving around.
[66:07.72]This is disk one.
[66:13.40]This is important, because if I can change the disk to it and press okay, then... Holy fuck.
[66:18.26]I am a goddamn genius.
[66:22.90]I just need to check to make sure this is going to work.
[66:25.60]Oh yeah, right.
[66:26.09]This has got to get off the screen.
[66:27.13]You're right.
[66:28.81]Okay.
[66:30.79]Here we go.
[66:32.45]Newsroom.
[66:34.26]Insert disk 2 into the drive.
[66:36.62]Control F4.
[66:37.52]You're on disk 2 now.
[67:13.02]I'm gonna relish in this one.
[67:16.12]I am gonna relish in this shit.
[67:18.07]You better believe it.
[67:19.93]You didn't think I was smart enough to handle this.
[67:22.69]Nobody did.
[67:24.15]But I am.
[67:31.21]You didn't think I was fucking smart enough to handle it.
[67:34.59]Oh, but you were wrong.
[67:37.01]You were all wrong.
[67:39.53]I knew about the mounting.
[67:40.53]I knew about the images.
[67:41.99]I knew about the onion.
[67:43.97]Although it's hard to recalibrate this.
[67:46.31]That's alright.
[67:46.89]It looks good.
[67:47.79]Let's go.
[67:48.95]I'm fucking on.
[67:50.27]I'm absolutely on cloud nine right now.
[67:52.55]I'm like so happy.
[67:55.43]I did that under pressure too.
[67:58.22]That was a fucking end zone pass that I just... It was an end zone pass.
[68:02.76]Can you guys see?
[68:16.00]How did I gain viewers doing that?
[68:19.70]I don't know how that's possible.
[68:28.99]I'm supposed to meet somebody here, right?
[68:38.48]They expected a cool programming stream.
[68:48.59]it's already in there there's a brain I think I think our whack the machine is still going to be broken though a computer with a deck port you can never have too many of those okay should I go in
[69:20.39]Exit cyberspace.
[69:26.57]Why?
[69:27.03]Is this supposed to be virtual reality?
[69:31.38]Berman Incorporated.
[69:39.26]Virtual library.
[69:40.67]Virtual library.
[69:41.91]Sure, let's open it up.
[69:43.71]I hope it asks me to change discs.
[69:45.19]I'm ready for it.
[69:52.82]Tales from the Crypt.
[69:56.48]What is this?
[69:59.98]I can't see what that is.
[70:04.69]A note with some call numbers on it.
[70:06.21]Am I underwater?
[70:07.03]Could Renee Stein have left this here?
[70:08.51]I could use some help here.
[70:13.01]You're a human presence, I assume.
[70:15.09]Everyone at a service desk is.
[70:17.43]The library doesn't use smart sprites for public interface.
[70:21.38]You don't read much, do you?
[70:27.74]This sucks.
[70:29.46]Go back to DOSBox coding.
[70:31.58]Ask if she's seen Renee Stein.
[70:33.06]Did you see a woman named Renee Stein recently?
[70:35.82]Records place her here, but she didn't check anything out and I don't remember seeing her.
[70:43.41]Okay, what about the call number?
[70:44.47]Can you help me with this call number?
[70:46.38]I'm sorry, this is not a valid call number.
[70:49.64]It appears Stein altered the reference matrix, but an unknown book was distributed.
[70:55.06]If you could unscramble the call number, I could help you.
[71:00.01]Unscramble the call number.
[71:02.65]Prior period distribution was physical deletion uncompleted.
[71:05.19]Okay, address call number.
[71:07.99]Who am I doing this for?
[71:09.05]What do you mean, who's call, what?
[71:30.25]That's all I know.
[71:31.15]Just tell me what it is.
[71:42.74]Just tell me what it is.
[72:01.31]HC... I don't care.
[72:03.92]HC4... No, is this correct?
[72:06.06]Nah, I'm not writing that unless I know it's for real.
[72:11.74]I don't know if that... I'm not writing that.
[72:12.90]I don't know what that is.
[72:18.67]Can I get a mod to look it up?
[72:22.95]I can look it up.
[72:29.53]The HC is on my screen.
[72:31.26]Alright, so what was it?
[72:38.00]I thought you guys were writing, like, he shit whatever.
[72:42.56]Like, he wrote a thing he didn't think he was writing, but he did.
[72:45.35]Like, he shit.
[72:47.87]HC.
[72:48.03]What was it?
[72:57.97]Four or five.
[72:59.57]Say it again.
[73:11.46]Tell me what the code is!
[73:17.10]73T.
[73:17.30]I think the game crashed.
[73:31.74]You should really look into this, Quinlan.
[73:34.14]It could mean something.
[73:35.40]Did I get it?
[73:40.04]Can you help me with this call number?
[73:42.24]I'm sorry.
[73:43.18]This is not a valid call number.
[73:45.51]It appears Stein altered the reference matrix, but an unknown book was distributed.
[73:50.95]If you could unscramble the call number, I could help you.
[73:57.71]What is it?
[73:59.97]HC...
[74:01.90]Is the actual number.
[74:05.51]No.
[74:06.93]Two.
[74:12.47]I looked it up.
[74:17.03]The four numbers are contained in the square brackets.
[74:19.85]In order to figure it out, you need to make sense of the gibberish.
[74:22.11]You can read the code like this.
[74:26.13]So this one?
[74:26.87]What is it?
[74:28.45]What's the last one?
[74:30.85]Wait, Quinlan, that's a valid call number.
[74:33.54]I'll get the book.
[74:34.86]People didn't think I was capable of doing it, but I just continued to prove them wrong.
[74:40.66]A book about the original Jack the Ripper.
[74:44.03]Can't be a coincidence.
[74:45.83]Renee Stein must have used this.
[74:48.69]But what does it mean?
[74:49.73]You read chat.
[74:50.39]I didn't read chat.
[74:51.25]What the fuck are you talking about?
[74:53.31]Have the cops talked to you?
[74:55.04]They asked questions, but I couldn't tell them much.
[74:58.04]They copied all the files from the Victorian root directory and ordered us not to alter the file structures until the case is solved.
[75:04.44]I've been streaming for like six hours.
[75:06.82]Guess so.
[75:09.38]I sure didn't take them.
[75:10.54]Alright, well I got some new info.
[75:15.00]I'm out.
[75:19.32]How do I leave?
[75:19.96]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[75:28.50]All I can do for you is recommend something to read, Quinlan.
[75:31.93]How about Marchok's The Da Vinci Engine?
[75:34.79]It's a study that reveals how Leonardo theorized cyberspace back in the 17th century.
[75:44.47]How do I leave?
[75:46.61]Oh, you have to press escape.
[75:49.30]Alright.
[75:50.87]I got new info.
[75:52.63]I'm gonna... It's midnight always.
[75:54.13]Watch out for the skull.
[75:55.57]Dangerous.
[75:56.97]Watch out for the... I don't know what that was.
[76:00.73]Sun.
[76:01.97]Moon.
[76:03.43]Eye.
[76:05.26]Exit.
[76:05.56]Exit cyberspace.
[76:12.44]Yes.
[76:13.50]Okay.
[76:14.02]Phew.
[76:27.94]Gee, if anything should happen to me, lose the crystals.
[76:34.58]Look to the crystals and let the light shine your way.
[76:38.14]Alright, where's like the... I want to fight.
[76:52.82]I think I gotta go talk to the chief.
[76:59.72]No, not this way.
[77:02.60]Don't fight.
[77:03.30]It's okay.
[77:10.20]This is an adventure game.
[77:11.46]There is no fighting.
[77:12.24]There's combat in the game.
[77:16.10]There is combat in the game, and I'm going to see it.
[77:18.72]There we are.
[77:19.10]I want to go in here.
[77:24.78]No, why are you leaving?
[77:28.52]Here we are, here we go.
[77:30.08]Ben, dogs.
[77:33.26]Give me a new area, and we're gonna get our first, uh, fist fight.
[77:41.95]Hey, Ben.
[77:43.61]How's Catherine today?
[77:47.43]No change.
[77:48.75]His coat looks like it's made out of licorice, I'm not gonna lie.
[77:51.01]This guy is the devil himself.
[77:56.52]Ben, you know this cop, Magnata?
[77:59.96]Typical new breed cop.
[78:02.40]One of those guys started arresting people in volume when cops started collecting bonuses.
[78:08.28]He's been more aggressive than most.
[78:11.52]Yeah, that's common knowledge, but what's his story?
[78:14.13]He's killed six people in the line of duty, some under questionable circumstances.
[78:19.63]He's bad news.
[78:21.39]I wouldn't mess with him, Quinlan.
[78:25.47]Do the funny voice, which one did you find?
[78:28.20]Alright, what about Joey Falconetti?
[78:30.24]You ever hear of Joey Falconetti, Ben?
[78:33.78]No, the name sounds vaguely familiar, but I can't quite place it.
[78:38.43]Alright, well, let's go.
[78:42.95]Let's get out of here.
[78:43.67]I'm going to see Joey.
[78:45.11]I can't wait to change disk.
[78:50.09]Because that, I mean, that was just... Hold on.
[78:54.80]I got a belch coming.
[79:00.10]You don't like the song.
[79:02.07]It's not gonna be... Just relax.
[79:05.69]Guys, we only have, like, another four to five hours in this game.
[79:09.11]So... Pull up a chair.
[79:12.17]Sit down.
[79:12.75]Because I've lied to you this whole evening.
[79:19.28]This is all I got.
[79:20.60]Out of all the FMV games I tried to get to work, this is the only one that works.
[79:24.34]So, I mean, I would... Dude, this is a good one, I think.
[79:28.18]How do I leave the fucking building?
[79:36.72]I want to leave the building.
[79:41.85]And if you think that's legit, you're out of your mind.
[79:49.59]Okay.
[79:50.87]Leave the fucking building.
[79:58.85]I want to leave the office.
[80:02.41]Stop.
[80:03.41]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[80:04.55]Turn around.
[80:06.41]Oh my god.
[80:12.13]And then I have to go here and then I have to turn around from here.
[80:15.91]My goodness.
[80:17.85]Alright, what we got?
[80:19.64]Newsroom, uh... Café Duchamp.
[80:24.22]Is that a Quentin Motta Wack you've got there?
[80:27.38]I've been grepping for one of these for months.
[80:30.02]These are tough to find if you're not in the professions.
[80:32.18]What are you, a lawyer?
[80:33.64]Reporter for the Herald.
[80:35.92]Low end of the pay scale, eh?
[80:37.72]Tell me about it.
[80:38.78]You should work for yourself.
[80:39.78]There are thousands of ways to make money in the net.
[80:42.20]Believe me, I know.
[80:43.00]The internet?
[80:47.27]Is he drinking out of a Manila envelope?
[80:52.63]Or is that a candle?
[80:53.57]He's drinking out of a candle.
[80:54.99]Do you know Joey Falconetti?
[80:57.18]Joey Falconetti?
[80:59.66]I haven't done business with that scoundrel in years.
[81:02.04]Talk about profiteering in the net.
[81:04.02]But do you know him?
[81:05.26]Eddie and I owned part of an emoticon franchise.
[81:07.84]You know, one of those sea-spaced emotional counterzones?
[81:11.10]This was years ago.
[81:12.46]Legitimate business.
[81:13.36]Why can't that just be a real mug?
[81:15.30]Eddie's a thief by nature.
[81:17.04]Robbed it blind.
[81:18.68]We had to sell out to some Palestinians in New Dallas.
[81:21.56]I haven't worked with Eddie since, but I keep an eye on him so he doesn't pilfer any of my movies.
[81:28.13]Is this still the same game from before?
[81:30.33]Yes, it is.
[81:31.89]It is.
[81:35.78]Uh, what's over here?
[81:42.57]Bartender.
[81:48.63]Been reading your copy, Quinlan.
[81:51.03]You might nail this freak before the police do.
[81:53.01]I'm fucking huge.
[81:53.67]Just asking questions, seeing where the answers take me.
[81:55.37]You're like seven feet tall.
[81:58.11]Kind of slow in here.
[81:59.41]Yeah, the Rippers really put a damper on anonymous sex these days.
[82:02.52]What?
[82:04.47]Wait, wait, wait.
[82:05.07]What are you talking about?
[82:07.27]Because I thought this was a bar.
[82:11.82]That is not what I asked.
[82:12.68]How about a beer?
[82:16.26]Yeah, sure thing.
[82:18.28]Why don't you try this one?
[82:20.40]It's called Viper Pills.
[82:23.63]Viper Pills?
[82:24.07]Goes down real smooth.
[82:25.89]It's got some bite.
[82:30.35]On the house.
[82:31.48]Just nail the ripper so that my customers can get drunk in public again.
[82:36.24]Okay.
[82:37.48]Sure.
[82:38.38]You know what?
[82:39.06]That was probably take number 40.
[82:41.18]How about a beer?
[82:45.84]He was probably so sick of doing that by now.
[82:48.42]Give me another one.
[82:49.00]Why don't you try this one?
[82:50.52]It's called Viper Pills.
[82:54.08]It goes down real smooth.
[82:56.02]It's got some bite.
[83:00.45]On the house.
[83:01.63]Just nail the ripper so that my customers can get drunk in public.
[83:03.85]You didn't even give me the whole thing.
[83:04.85]That's just all head.
[83:06.37]Okay, there's no beer.
[83:07.75]That's just all foam.
[83:08.75]You're just drinking like a cappuccino beer.
[83:11.28]Alright, what about Gambit Nelson?
[83:12.30]What do you know about Gambit Nelson?
[83:15.40]Gambit?
[83:17.06]Gambit's been coming in here for years.
[83:21.17]You smoke it in your own bar?
[83:22.15]What?
[83:22.33]Gambit's seen it all.
[83:24.79]He can remember when the net went online.
[83:27.60]back when they weren't any well.
[83:28.92]What a free beer.
[83:30.14]A bunch of isolated BBSs.
[83:32.42]Must be a first generation Decker.
[83:34.26]Beanbags Onyx?
[83:34.96]One of the first C-Space entrepreneurs.
[83:37.12]I'm gonna be killing him.
[83:39.00]All of it's legal.
[83:41.30]Weird, huh?
[83:42.80]You know, a good guy wins for once in a blue fucking moon.
[83:51.24]Fuck him.
[83:51.46]Okay.
[83:53.28]Well, thanks for the... Thanks for the foam.
[84:04.23]One more.
[84:05.29]No.
[84:10.38]We didn't do all the dialog here.
[84:12.82]Where can I find Falcon Eddie?
[84:14.68]Do you know where I can find Falcon Eddie?
[84:17.34]You don't.
[84:18.72]The Falcon usually finds you and takes your money.
[84:22.14]Well, lucky for me, I'm broke.
[84:24.46]A grave digger named Farley at the Metacar told me that you might be a link to finding him.
[84:29.32]What's your interest?
[84:30.02]You out to kill him?
[84:31.88]Well, it's not killing I had in mind.
[84:34.15]Well, somebody's going to whack that bird one of these days.
[84:37.21]Eddie's consciousness is inside a few hundred terabytes of well space with his body safely hidden.
[84:43.72]I set Metacog up with a guy named Twig.
[84:46.20]Lives out in Hoboken.
[84:47.18]He seems to always know where Eddie's at.
[84:48.60]Twig.
[84:49.48]Eddie usually presents himself with video.
[84:52.29]He likes to show off.
[84:54.61]Hoboken.
[84:58.61]You know, I've kind of lost all knowledge of what we were doing.
[85:02.44]Mr. Nelson, what's your background with cyberspace?
[85:04.30]Got some time.
[85:04.82]That would take a while.
[85:05.90]There's a serial player on the list.
[85:07.14]You want another one?
[85:08.38]I can get you another one.
[85:09.22]What about down here?
[85:10.14]Is this a computer game?
[85:31.82]No, not a computer game.
[85:34.14]How about a beer?
[85:42.56]Yeah, sure thing.
[85:45.83]Game hiking sucks.
[85:47.31]It's called Viper Pills.
[85:49.39]Goes down real smooth.
[85:52.21]It's got some bite.
[86:04.33]How does something go down really smooth and have a bunch of bite at the same time?
[86:09.66]Alright.
[86:11.10]Newsroom, police station.
[86:12.74]Didn't we get some... a new area?
[86:17.20]Evidence room.
[86:19.14]Um... What do I need to do?
[86:21.98]Where the hell do I go?
[86:25.22]I can do that!
[86:27.28]Control F4.
[86:29.45]That's Disk 3.
[86:31.33]Disk 4.
[86:33.22]Disk 5.
[86:35.10]Disk 6.
[86:35.48]Disk 1.
[86:41.99]I am so proud of myself.
[86:50.15]He's showing off his disk skill.
[86:55.23]What is this?
[86:55.65]Dude, that is going to help so much in the
[87:06.20]Uh, don't look at that.
[87:09.64]Don't look at that.
[87:10.10]You're not old enough.
[87:17.14]Uh, okay.
[87:17.54]I'm 25.
[87:20.42]That's not old enough.
[87:36.26]It's all the stars.
[87:39.98]No, no, no.
[87:40.32]Cancel.
[87:48.82]What the fuck am I supposed to do here?
[87:51.59]I'm trying to figure out what I need to do.
[87:57.09]Alright, there's... Happy birthday.
[87:59.66]I'm glad I found you.
[88:01.18]Love... Is this the cat?
[88:04.10]No, the crystals.
[88:06.24]Is this the crystal person?
[88:07.82]Go find the crystals.
[88:16.72]Where are the crystals?
[88:24.36]Straight ahead?
[88:25.00]What's over here?
[88:29.30]Is this, uh, Super Bowl... 10... What is L?
[88:35.61]Is this like Super Bowl 400 or something?
[88:40.03]Wait a minute.
[88:41.63]A laser cane.

[88:52.40]J. Dorset.

[89:35.51]Like, literally, if you want to type into the chat, the next thing I need to do, just type it.
[89:39.73]I don't care.
[89:41.97]It's okay.
[89:49.82]No.
[89:50.50]This game is really hard without a walkthrough.
[89:52.52]Newsroom, police station, what do I do?
[90:06.81]Café du Cham.
[90:07.91]No, I already was there.
[90:10.65]Newsroom.
[90:11.29]Let's go back to the newsroom?
[90:13.67]Let's go back to the... We have to go talk to... You want us to be the walkthrough.
[90:20.25]Yeah.
[90:23.64]I've been to all these places.
[90:32.20]Should I go back to the police station?
[90:36.83]I have to get that guy to give me the thing.
[90:41.45]Arrow buttons.
[90:44.19]Nope.
[90:46.53]That doesn't do anything.
[90:49.15]Button's in the middle.
[90:49.89]No, it doesn't do anything.
[90:50.71]Let's see.
[90:53.93]Fuck.
[90:55.17]Help.
[91:04.22]Okay.
[91:07.79]I found the website on a website called Game Boomers.
[91:14.53]What disk are we on?
[91:17.15]We're on disk one, right?
[91:25.06]Alright, Ben, you got anything for me?
[91:42.91]The Times is breathing down our back on this story.
[91:45.47]Get to work.
[91:47.31]Do you give me a help me?
[91:50.29]Somebody said talk to Ben and it didn't do anything.
[91:57.50]Go back to the morgue.
[92:08.64]Go back to the apartment.
[92:11.70]Talk to Brad.
[92:13.07]Who's Brad?
[92:21.65]Use the whack thing and fix the mug.
[92:28.99]Wait, okay.
[92:30.05]Power.
[92:30.77]No.
[92:32.27]Database.
[92:33.61]Broken mug.
[92:34.13]Puzzle.
[93:07.26]Uh... What?
[93:09.48]How are there two handles?
[93:10.55]Can I flip it?
[93:14.69]Okay.
[93:16.27]Don't say, like, zero IQ.
[93:17.95]I thought they would... I got this.
[93:22.68]Oh, shit.
[93:30.54]This actually sucks.
[93:33.09]Uh...
[93:35.10]This is gonna be kinda hard.
[93:36.30]I have to flip the whole fucking thing?
[93:38.34]I have to flip the whole fucking thing?
[93:42.21]I need- where's the thing that's- I need written.
[93:51.33]I just need the text.
[93:57.04]I don't care about anything else.
[93:57.92]Alright, this is gonna W.
[94:27.53]Get this out of the fucking way.
[94:28.55]It's causing me too much stress.
[94:40.59]This doesn't make any fucking sense.
[94:54.42]What?
[95:16.39]Fucked.
[95:17.69]Wait, hold on.
[95:20.03]Um.
[96:14.83]I want... You... How am I... I can't... Like, there's perspective.
[96:17.73]So, like, I wanted to put these in the back.
[96:26.34]Oh, my lord.
[96:27.40]You just... I don't even know which way... This way this thing's facing right now.
[96:30.98]Uh...
[97:07.11]It doesn't make any fucking sense because they all This goes here it has to right?
[97:29.40]Does it have to be vertical?
[97:45.95]Because I can't, like, spin these in the right... Like, this goes here.
[97:55.19]I don't fucking know.
[97:56.21]How the fuck am I supposed to know that?
[98:08.03]I guess that makes sense?
[98:30.47]The handle's on the right side.
[98:31.55]Yeah, that's what I... I've had that before, but... I...
[98:37.16]Is this shit upside down?
[98:48.83]It's not.
[98:52.43]Why can't I, like, lock this shit in place?
[98:54.32]I have to keep on, like, cha- Have I ever seen a mug before?
[99:03.32]Yeah, I have!
[99:08.23]This shit doesn't make any sense!
[99:18.94]Like, what the fuck is- what a piece is this?
[99:46.64]The handle has to be done last.
[99:51.84]What the fuck?
[99:55.27]This is awful.
[100:06.67]What does this side look like?
[100:07.72]Alright, I'm gonna say... Like, here?
[100:14.04]This is the top of the mug.
[100:15.20]That can't be right.
[100:45.67]I don't think this is correct.
[100:47.83]This is like a melted candle.
[100:58.24]What the fuck?
[100:59.38]This doesn't make any sense.
[101:11.27]That's the bottom of this?
[101:23.85]There ain't no more- Where- I need another lip!
[101:28.50]There ain't even enough pieces to do this!
[101:35.03]There's not enough pieces to finish this!
[101:54.14]There's nothing even written on here.
[102:12.55]And then.
[102:23.85]Get the fuck out of here.
[102:26.45]Salisbury.
[102:28.15]I wonder what that means.
[102:30.23]Salisbury.
[102:32.91]Cool.
[102:35.49]What's in the river book?
[102:39.26]Salisbury.
[102:40.54]I didn't even get anything between that.
[102:46.46]Okay.
[102:47.06]Salisbury.
[102:47.68]Is that a password somewhere?
[103:01.51]I'm not writing this, the game I think is doing it on its own.
[105:03.09]Does that stay?
[105:05.91]It stays.
[105:06.43]Good.
[105:07.63]Exit without saving.
[105:08.83]No.
[105:08.93]You're supposed to talk.
[105:11.22]No, I don't have to talk.
[105:19.46]What does Salisbury mean?
[105:21.73]Do I have to put that in a computer or something?
[105:34.34]Oh, fucking 100 bucks came in.
[105:38.80]From Slade.
[105:39.76]Thank you, Slade, for the 10,000 bits.
[105:42.86]100 bucks.
[105:47.95]They say, just use this to buy a new mug.
[105:50.47]That would buy like 10, 20 new mugs.
[105:54.05]George Rhodes.
[105:55.89]Phone.
[105:56.99]Call.
[106:01.39]Salisbury.
[106:02.11]We're looking for Salisbury.
[106:04.50]Iris Salisbury.
[106:07.22]Lou Salisbury.
[106:09.46]Rachel Salisbury.
[106:11.64]Soap Salisbury.
[106:13.48]George Salisbury.
[106:14.60]God damn it.
[106:20.86]How do I, like, call these people?
[106:29.65]Forward dimensions for bugs.
[106:31.59]What?
[106:36.15]I got no fucking idea.
[106:38.47]All I know is I have a Salisbury.
[106:41.39]What is that?
[106:50.08]Why do I have a calculator?
[107:06.04]Divide by zero.
[107:11.50]Wait, hold on.
[107:11.98]Can I do this?
[107:12.36]I used to do this when I was bored.
[107:14.44]Like, I don't know, like 15, right?
[107:16.86]Or like 18.
[107:19.10]Plus 18.
[107:19.48]And then I would just go like this.
[107:21.88]No, this calculus sucks.
[107:25.50]I would just see how many numbers I could go up.
[107:34.55]I don't know what the point of this is.
[107:38.95]I don't know what the point of this game is at the moment.
[107:44.10]I think I have to go back to the apartment?
[107:49.32]I've spent a very long time in this game.
[107:51.80]There's another hundred bucks.
[107:55.83]Evil Crucifix just gave me another hundred dollars.
[108:02.63]Both of you slayed and evil crucifix back-to-back.
[108:04.71]I heard you need a mug.
[108:06.03]Need a new mug.
[108:06.73]Uh, through the grapevine.
[108:08.05]This might be able to pay for it.
[108:10.23]And now this is too many mugs.
[108:14.96]But... Thank you for the fucking hundred bucks back-to-back, both of you guys.
[108:20.40]Go back to Catherine's apartment.
[108:22.66]Alright, I'll go.
[108:28.73]Walkthrough says to type 8008.
[108:30.17]Okay.
[108:31.99]Well, you got me to say it.
[108:38.88]What is happening?
[108:39.86]What sign is she from the constellation Pisces?
[108:41.94]Try to use the entire area using the star chart by plotting it on a grid.
[108:45.59]What the fuck?
[108:47.01]What do you mean by plotting it on a grid?
[109:00.19]Catherine's apartment.
[109:02.91]We on two?
[109:03.43]Three.
[109:06.41]Four.
[109:07.95]Oh fuck, that's not the right button.
[109:09.75]Let's control F2, dude, in DOSBox.
[109:11.45]So you're saying go over the constellations.
[109:31.42]I can't interact with them, though.
[109:41.15]10, 11, 12, Sev, Taurus, Gemini, Scorpio.
[109:46.86]You have to chart them.
[109:48.08]What do you mean I have to chart them?
[110:01.37]Salisbury.
[110:10.61]What the fuck sorry I had to power down for a second.
[110:12.45]What did you say?
[110:13.21]What was the last thing you said?
[110:21.25]There are books.
[110:21.79]Look at the books.
[110:22.57]Books.
[110:23.07]Books.
[110:23.59]Wait, where am I?
[110:24.87]Where am I?
[110:25.27]Okay.
[110:26.51]Look at the book.
[110:27.59]Look at the books.
[110:34.66]What books?
[110:38.36]I don't see any books.
[110:39.18]Where are these books?
[110:40.20]These crystals?
[110:42.40]This game fucking sucks.
[110:44.06]Laughing my ass off.
[110:48.65]Wait.
[110:49.21]Okay, hold on.
[110:50.21]They're the crystals.
[110:52.65]Catherine's crystals.
[110:54.69]I always thought they were a little too neo-new agey for Catherine.
[111:02.30]Oh, fuck off.
[111:10.81]Really?
[111:11.93]I have to do?
[111:12.49]I have to do the whole other constellation.
[111:17.73]OK.
[111:20.97]OK.
[111:23.45]The chart.
[111:24.17]Yeah.
[111:25.93]Right.
[111:26.93]Well.
[111:31.55]OK.
[111:37.63]I, uh.
[111:39.72]I want to reset this.
[112:03.20]Happy birthday.
[112:03.92]I'm glad I found you.
[112:05.14]Love, Jake.
[112:06.47]February.
[112:11.92]Look at the crystal part.
[112:13.05]Hold on.
[112:15.17]You want to go to the police station, right-click on the crystallizer.
[112:17.70]It makes it easier later on.
[112:19.06]Then you want to head to the...
[112:39.21]I think it's time to move on to Scotty Pippin's Slam.
[112:43.39]If it were me.
[112:53.74]Okay.
[112:54.94]Sounds good.
[112:56.44]Save it, though.
[112:57.06]Just in case I decide to play this again.
[112:58.98]I might come back to it.
[113:09.57]Look, we might just come back to it, but I want to play Scotty Pipton Slam Dunk.
[113:16.30]He's giving up.
[113:16.96]I'm not giving up.
[113:18.70]It also gives me enough time to open up a guide to just have him next to me the whole time.
[113:24.38]He's never coming back to this game.
[113:30.01]You don't know that, though.
[113:31.45]You don't know that.
[113:34.09]I have it saved.
[113:34.87]You don't know that.
[113:37.49]How do you know that for a fact?
[113:44.67]You can't tell me that reliably.
[113:48.19]Alright, let's do Scotty Pippin's Basketball.
[113:54.59]That game hurt.
[113:57.85]That game hurt my head.
[114:01.43]Alright, so now, same deal.
[114:04.31]I'm going to mount...
[114:06.79]Hey, you guys, we got hit DOS is on screen.
[114:11.77]Take a look at that.
[114:17.91]We got multiple disks in this one.
[114:24.63]Here comes more DOS hacking.
[114:28.39]The view count is going to go up like fucking 200.
[114:30.07]Alright, so I need to mount these disks.
[114:37.49]Check it out.
[114:55.64]OK.
[115:04.78]OK.

[115:15.95]He's quick with this.
[115:17.59]He's doing good.
[115:18.35]Am I on two?
[115:28.77]I forgot how to do it.
[115:29.61]Okay, no I don't.

[116:11.23]Bingo.
[116:15.24]Oh.
[116:15.30]What are you talking about?
[116:21.12]Oh, I'm already there.
[116:21.80]Uh-oh.
[116:46.46]No, no.
[116:47.06]I screwed it up.
[116:47.76]I'm an idiot.
[116:50.52]There's another slam folder.
[116:55.21]There's two slams.
[117:01.09]Slam.
[117:04.81]This needs a Pentium processor.
[117:06.35]Shit.
[117:06.91]Hold on.
[117:07.75]Wait, wait, wait.
[117:10.27]You relax.

[117:38.99]Easy.
[117:39.31]It's the easiest thing I've done all day.

[118:41.21]No, I got a good PC.
[118:42.59]Let's just do it again.
[118:44.43]There's no problem here.

[162:44.69]I'll do it quick.
[162:58.30]Alright.
[163:04.25]Let's go.

[163:07.91]I'm going to do the wizard game.
[163:14.70]This one looks a little better.
[163:15.68]I don't know if this plays a little better.
[163:16.94]We'll find out.
[163:23.87]And here we go.
[163:27.51]Three, two, one.
[163:29.37]Hey!
[163:29.89]I'm gonna have to move some shit around here.
[163:40.06]This is gonna be in the wrong spot.
[163:47.43]Let's see where it ends up.
[163:51.85]Can't really... Oh, I guess it's the same.
[163:53.49]It's in the right spot.
[164:11.51]How's that look?
[164:12.69]I think I can make that a little bit bigger.
[164:16.05]If I can.
[164:16.75]That looks alright.
[164:18.74]Alright.
[164:41.66]So we last left our wizard friend here.
[164:46.15]This is loud as fuck.
[164:47.61]I already can tell.
[164:52.35]That's... That's alright.
[165:00.20]Start as an apprentice.
[165:01.44]Should we do the history?
[165:02.18]So you guys can remember what happened?
[165:07.48]In the times of old, there was a land of five kingdoms, justly ruled by the Argent Kings.
[165:17.79]With their greatest magic, they created an amulet made of five powerful relics joined together.
[165:26.00]They entrusted it to Mobus, the wisest wizard in the land.
[165:30.87]But Mobus had a jealous brother named Torlok the Twisted.
[165:36.21]He betrayed the Argent Kings, hunting them down to the last.
[165:40.75]His dark armies then overran the kingdoms.
[165:45.74]Mobus shattered the amulet into its five pieces to keep it out of Torlock's reach.
[165:53.29]It's the same video.
[165:54.53]Mobus then hid the pieces, one to a kingdom.
[165:59.18]Many years later, a young man named Lathan Kandor set out to rejoin the amulet.
[166:06.41]He searched for the relics with the help of his mentor, the wizard Daelon.
[166:11.75]Daelon and Lathan.
[166:12.85]In the kingdom of Wygard, inside the legendary Castle of Crystal, Lathan found the first relic.

[179:34.91]Where do they get guns?
[179:37.38]That was fucking useless.
[179:42.98]I'd leave here if I were you.
[179:44.68]Well, you're not me, so you can keep advice like that to yourself.
[179:49.89]That was so stupid.
[179:53.72]My dragon awoke hungry.
[180:10.37]That was fuckin' stupid!
[180:12.14]Why do they- they were like rubber band guns!
[180:14.42]They weren't even real guns!
[180:15.96]That wasn't even real guns.

[197:17.22]Wait, what are you talking about?
[197:21.03]Oh, but that doesn't kill me.
[197:28.37]Oh, that doesn't kill you.
[197:30.06]I thought I'm dead in here.
[197:31.56]Well, what the fuck is up with that?
[197:38.45]You're the one that took my potion!
[197:41.37]Put him inside of the barrel!
[197:43.47]That's it!
[197:45.73]That's it!
[197:46.91]Who cares?
[197:47.33]Alright, so now I have to go to the rapids.
[197:58.25]Where were those?
[198:00.39]Does anybody remember where the hell that was?
[198:01.58]I think I should just die.
[198:04.26]I'll end up there.
[198:41.60]So then drink the potion in the boat.
[198:43.08]I do love these infant continues.
[198:56.58]So get in the boat.
[198:58.72]And now... take the potion.
[199:00.99]Why would I need to take the potion in the boat?
[199:02.65]The boat doesn't fly?
[199:07.35]Why do people tell me to do this?
[199:15.27]I have to go to the hills.
[199:17.89]Oh, God.
[199:18.79]That's it.
[199:19.31]That's it.
[199:19.69]God damn it.
[199:20.23]That's it.
[199:21.05]I'm out of this one.
[199:25.00]Take it in the boat.
[199:25.90]Why would I take it in the boat?
[199:27.34]I can't even... I can't even think about these things.
[199:36.13]What was I thinking?
[199:36.81]No.
[199:36.87]I gotta get out of this.

[231:40.76]I have to do it without cheating.
[231:41.72]I have to do it without cheating.
[231:44.96]Thank you, Robert.
[231:45.58]You can help.
[231:47.05]These guys look tough.
[231:48.11]Do you think you can handle it?
[231:50.07]He's like killed here right now.
[231:51.41]Why?
[231:52.87]Not now.
[231:53.61]I'm busy.
[231:56.51]You're a history partner.
[232:08.03]Same guy every time.
[232:10.29]Shit.
[232:10.51]I'm getting a fucking migraine right now.
[232:15.61]Completely unrelated.
[232:44.63]Oh my god, I'm so- My left eye.
[232:46.36]I got it!
[232:49.82]Oh my fucking god.
[233:13.60]Your history, dude.
[233:18.61]Hold on.
[233:19.01]Let me go get some water.
[233:21.17]I actually do have like a migraine right now.
[233:23.95]Fuck.
[233:25.91]I'll be right back.
[235:15.08]Oh.
[235:16.26]The BRB was behind this.
[235:19.88]This game's hard.
[235:26.60]Wimpy is hard mode?
[235:27.73]No, it's not.
[235:31.37]So, I need to... Unfortunately, I gotta slow down a little.
[235:38.29]I'm getting a migraine that's going over the left side of my head here.
[235:44.32]It started to happen, like, maybe 30, 40 minutes ago, and I was just like, eh, whatever.
[235:49.09]I don't know why the fuck this is happening.
[235:50.65]I drank a Coors Light.
[235:52.45]That's literally what happened.
[236:05.40]Now I get migraines.
[236:07.04]So it's not out of the ordinary.
[236:09.12]Just when they happen on stream, it's kind of annoying.
[236:13.42]Four hours.
[236:17.66]I really wanted to go for like five.
[236:25.67]He's getting a one beer hangover right now.
[236:34.73]Oh, this sucks.
[236:39.06]Ugh.
[236:42.92]Let me just chill for a minute.
[236:45.10]We'll see if this is just like a little thing that might start going over bits.
[236:54.97]Just to hang out.
[236:59.23]You know what?
[236:59.89]I think like laughing at shit will make this really way worse.
[237:06.77]So sorry guys.
[237:07.75]Sorry that I have to kind of just chill now.
[237:15.19]Tomorrow, I was going to do this again.
[237:19.51]There's still a few more.
[237:22.15]And I'm going to run out of them by tomorrow.
[237:27.01]So what we're going to do tomorrow is we'll do the remaining few that I have.
[237:31.75]And then we'll probably just move on to something else.
[237:36.14]Yes, I do have the sequel to Crime Patrol.
[237:37.80]I have Crime Patrol 2 as well.
[237:50.90]Uh, I'm, I'm annoyed right now, but what am I gonna do?
[237:55.52]Right?
[237:55.78]You know what I mean?
[237:56.29]Like, what am I gonna do?
[237:57.35]Be upset about this?
[237:59.31]Probably.
[237:59.69]It's alright, though.
[238:03.73]Um, let's just hang out.
[238:06.51]I'll see you guys tomorrow, those of you that, uh, I might just call it in like an hour or so.
[238:11.91]Let's just hang out.
[238:15.23]And we'll do the bits.
[238:19.08]Thanks for joining me.
[238:20.38]Uh, sorry it was a four-hour- This is back-to-back, like, four-hour streams, too, and that's... kind of not what I wanted to do.
[238:27.81]Yesterday was unrelated to, like, getting a fucking headache.
[238:35.37]Do I get migraine auras?
[238:36.47]Yes, I do.
[238:37.43]What ends up happening is I start to get blind spots in my vision.
[238:41.40]It's almost like tinny metallic colors will appear.
[238:46.44]And it's almost like when I look at people's faces, it's almost like a Picasso painting.
[238:55.75]I get those.
[238:56.19]It's weird.
[238:56.73]It's very weird.
[239:03.72]those suck yeah and the thing about that when you get an aura with a migraine at least for me holy shit it everything turns off for like three straight days I can't do anything does your doctor oh yeah yeah yeah I've don't worry I've been to the doctor about this this is a 15 plus year long thing it's like colitis so don't worry
[239:34.01]But I'm alright.
[239:34.65]I just feel like I'm going to make it way worse if I continue to kind of be at an energy level that's higher than right this second.
[239:46.82]And Crime Patrol 2, I don't know if it's going to be that game.
[239:50.76]And I also have Cycle Mania.
[239:53.44]And, I mean, Cycle Mania might do it to me.
[239:56.31]So I gotta be careful.
[239:57.55]Cycle Mania is a fucking motorcycle game.
[240:01.23]An FMV motorcycle game.
[240:08.44]But I'm alright just to hang out.
[240:10.15]We'll do the bits.
[240:11.93]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[240:18.91]Let's go back a few hours ago.
[240:21.54]Where I missed a lot of stuff today.
[240:23.22]JermaSucks, thanks for the five community subs.
[240:26.24]This is from just about four hours ago now.
[240:28.76]Thank you, JermaSucks.
[240:33.68]Get Night Trap.
[240:34.44]I already did Night Trap.
[240:35.95]This is FMV Part 2.
[240:40.39]I did almost every single SEGA CD game.
[240:43.75]These are some of the DOS ones that just kind of fell through the cracks.
[240:51.74]Some of them have been fucking great.
[240:55.58]I really think that Slam City with Scottie Pippen might be one of the best FMV games I've ever played.
[241:10.26]That was amazing.
[241:11.08]That was like the best fucking 45 minutes of my entire life.
[241:16.94]But thank you, Jerma Sucks, for the five subs.
[241:19.90]Sawdust Monies, thanks for the three bucks.
[241:23.00]Gnarly, thanks for the $2.50.
[241:24.14]They say, what's up with the bananas on your... on your video?
[241:32.29]What do you mean?
[241:32.81]What am I talking about?
[241:36.33]What's up with the bananas on your...
[241:39.76]let me see what you're talking about oh right on this video so uh I had just a bunch of random intro videos one of them was instead of germs it was bananas for my old youtube intro there's no reason for it it's just there
[242:04.94]Is it early YouTube?
[242:05.70]But that's not, no, that's not even early YouTube.
[242:08.84]That's 2015.
[242:09.38]That's not that long ago.
[242:14.26]I used it once.
[242:15.76]Yeah.
[242:16.82]So?
[242:21.63]It's there?
[242:25.05]That was four years ago.
[242:26.21]Four years ago is not that long when you're over 30.
[242:29.61]I got, I have some news for you.
[242:32.45]Once you pass 30, 3, 4, 5 years is like, oh, that was fucking yesterday.
[242:43.10]We had $200 bit donations.
[242:46.40]One from Evil Crucifix and one from Slade.
[242:49.60]Both back-to-back $100.
[242:51.18]Just used this to buy a new mug.
[242:52.84]That was during the mug meltdown.
[242:56.13]I'm not even going to call it a meltdown.
[242:59.49]Shouldn't be up there as a meltdown.
[243:05.25]But thank you both, you guys, for your huge, huge money.
[243:08.86]And speaking of huge money, Phylactery Lich also gave $50 a couple hours ago.
[243:14.32]Thank you.
[243:14.94]Thank you.
[243:15.30]Thank you.
[243:16.84]More money from Phylactery, if you could believe it.
[243:20.62]If you didn't think it was possible, there it is.
[243:24.93]Jerma, please don't ever stop playing this game because become friends with Chad and the bottle guy.
[243:29.73]Talking about Slam City.
[243:40.89]singularly funding this channel.
[243:46.83]Something like that.
[243:49.45]It's a lot of money, man.
[243:54.25]Thank you.
[243:57.63]Also, thank you to Disinterest for the $5.
[244:00.21]Hey, Jerma, I don't know if you've already been told this, but your Venus emote always looks a little bit like the baby Grinch doing a PogChamp face to me when it shows up in small... when it shows up small in chat for some reason.
[244:12.26]Thanks for the streams.
[244:14.08]Baby Grinch?
[244:17.68]Baby Grinch?
[244:18.48]I...
[244:32.61]mean maybe yeah maybe a little it does yeah when is baby Grinch in a movie I've never seen baby Grinch is that from the Jim Carrey Grinch movie I don't remember that scene
[245:02.70]Hold on, give me a little bit of a slack.
[245:04.64]That movie's four hours long.
[245:06.80]So, it's easy to forget.
[245:17.60]But thank you, Dysinterest for the $5.
[245:26.97]Thank you to the Wombat from Hell for the $2.50.
[245:33.24]say six months ago I vented in a bit message about my medical issues ruining my life and you offered incredibly kind words of wisdom and empathy I am now in college and for the first time I feel free from the anxiety of my health problems thank you so much for everything you did that got me through high school without having a mental breakdown and kept me laughing p.s are you ever going to play hat in time it's my favorite well first
[246:02.20]If you can seriously... If you can get through that shit and deal with it and take care of your problems, that's fucking awesome.
[246:13.42]I'm really happy to hear that it's going better.
[246:19.49]As somebody that has all kinds of fucking health problems, it can be a huge pain in the ass.
[246:27.07]A huge fucking pain in the ass.
[246:32.30]So, whatever you can do.
[246:36.41]And if you're going to say that I had something to do with any of that, I am incredibly fucking thankful.
[246:44.82]I can't even imagine.
[246:48.26]Whatever you get from this channel, I don't care what it is.
[246:52.34]Thank you for watching.
[246:53.72]I'm glad that you get something out of it.
[247:05.51]Thank you so much, Wombat from Hell.
[247:06.87]I'm glad you're doing better.
[247:11.19]Keep going.
[247:13.33]Keep managing.
[247:15.13]That's all you can do.
[247:19.20]Especially when it comes to health problems.
[247:26.62]We also had $10 come in from Uruhara.
[247:32.38]Thanks for the $10.
[247:33.88]No message, just $10.
[247:39.75]a few of these back to back to back here ten dollars from gnarly thank you gnarly this finally unlocks my 10 000 bit badge thank you so much for copious amounts of great content been watching for five years or so you're easily my favorite content creator on both platforms let's see if I can keep that going I'm gonna try
[248:10.27]Oh lord.
[248:16.11]Filactory.
[248:18.35]Holy shit, man.
[248:25.32]How does he do it?
[248:30.64]I don't know.
[248:36.44]But they continue to do.
[248:47.58]That's 69 more community subs from Phylacter Religion.
[248:57.72]That puts you... You are now responsible for a very large percentage of the people that are subscribed to this channel now.
[249:11.65]That's a pretty significant portion of people that are subbed.
[249:24.34]So, thank you.
[249:26.26]Completely, completely unnecessary.
[249:31.20]At this point.
[249:31.96]Because that's so much money.
[249:34.04]I hope you can afford it.
[249:35.94]If you can, then... Fucking awesome.
[249:38.99]I'm glad you got a lot of money.
[249:41.21]If you can't... Make sure you're taking care of yourself first.
[249:45.77]That's very important.
[249:51.57]He owns you now.
[249:53.27]I got too loud.
[249:55.17]I'm not supposed to be getting loud.
[249:57.59]But phylactery, that's an insane amount of subs.
[250:00.69]Sometimes this happens.
[250:02.01]Somebody gives a shitload of money over the course of a month or two.
[250:05.60]And it just floors me.
[250:07.54]So I can't believe it.
[250:09.56]I'm shocked that somebody would want to give me this much money as one single person.
[250:15.82]So thank you.
[250:16.94]I hope you can afford it.
[250:19.44]Thank you.
[250:23.30]doctor in chat yeah and good luck in with your uh with your patients because you're obviously a doctor and a scientist combined oh I didn't mention it hat in time right hat in time um probably not if I'm completely honest
[250:50.29]switch to this because I I do have I'm gonna go take like a bath or something just so I'm gonna like soak my head in water um probably not not now I don't want to say yeah maybe sure maybe you'll see it's up I don't want to do that because there's so much stuff going on over the next few weeks that that this would end up being another one of those scenarios where
[251:14.29]Oh, yeah, maybe in a few weeks.
[251:16.19]I don't know.
[251:16.69]And then in end of October, someone's going to ask the same question.
[251:20.07]And I'm going to be like, oh, yeah, maybe in a few weeks.
[251:30.52]So I don't want to tell people that I'm going to be doing things and then just not do them.
[251:35.98]When's the carnival?
[251:36.54]It's the 21st.
[251:39.42]The carnival is next week.
[251:42.94]next weekend September 21st I also want to say something about the activity book stream so if you have not get a submission in for the activity book because that is going to close uh this weekend so Friday so Friday night it's been that those channels have been live for a long time so I think it's time to close them up
[252:12.75]So on Friday, probably at like, I don't know, midnight Pacific, we're going to be closing those up.
[252:22.64]And then that stream will be the last stream that I do before leaving to go and do the carnival stream.
[252:31.03]So I'm going to give you some dates here because it's pretty important.
[252:35.13]Because this next week is going to be... I will not be streaming.
[252:38.75]Because I'm going to be setting up the whole carnival.
[252:40.86]So.
[252:42.62]Tomorrow.
[252:43.38]Live tomorrow.
[252:45.76]Which would be Thursday.
[252:48.27]And then Friday and Saturday is not going to be anything.
[252:53.09]And then Sunday, Monday... Sunday, Monday, Tuesday will be the last streams of that week.
[252:59.99]The next time you see... And maybe even Sunday, Monday will be the last two streams.
[253:04.12]Because I have to get going.
[253:06.82]I have to get on a plane and go across the country.
[253:10.80]So the 16th of September might be the last stream until the 21st.
[253:14.76]Or the 17th.
[253:15.36]I haven't decided yet.
[253:16.16]Depends on how much time I need to get ready.
[253:19.04]Because the 17th is when... Yeah, the 16th into the 17th is when I have to get out of here.
[253:26.82]He's quitting to become a clown.
[253:30.60]Maybe.
[253:31.79]No, not quitting.
[253:33.93]Make sure you pack your toothbrush.
[253:36.11]I will.
[253:37.87]Is there going to be any behind-the-scenes stuff for the carnival?
[253:40.89]I think Andy Mark is filming stuff.
[253:45.41]And we're probably going to do an AMA, at least I will, after the stream is over.
[253:50.99]But then TwitchCon... TwitchCon is that next week, so it's going to be all over the place.
[254:02.42]Streams are going to be a little bit of a juggle after this week, just because of TwitchCon and the carnival and everything.
[254:14.07]I'm looking forward to it.
[254:14.85]I can't wait.
[254:21.41]But tentatively, that activity book stream will be probably on the 16th.
[254:26.44]And it's just going to be us hanging out.
[254:28.40]No pressure, no nothing from anybody.
[254:30.84]Just fun little activities and jokes and stuff that people wrote and submitted.
[254:36.20]I'm going to compile it all into a big PDF and I'm going to do it all on stream.
[254:41.20]We're just going to hang out.
[254:42.88]It'll be a nice hangout stream.
[254:45.22]I can assure you.
[254:49.78]What time is the carnival going to be?
[254:52.00]I do have a time for you.
[254:54.65]September 21st at 12 p.m.
[254:58.83]Eastern time is when that stream is going to start, uh, turn on.
[255:07.86]Now, depending on making sure everything works, 12-ish.
[255:14.89]But I think we got a pretty hard start for 12 Eastern.
[255:22.77]And that is on a weekend, too, so it's Saturday.
[255:29.35]You're on Pacific, I'm sorry, but the stream will be on Eastern time.
[255:36.83]How long is it going to last?
[255:38.99]The time frame has been blocked out for somewhere between four and six hours.
[255:47.56]We're shooting for somewhere around five.
[255:49.36]Five hours, six hours or so.
[255:57.64]There's a lot going on on this stream.
[256:00.58]Let me tell you.
[256:05.13]This ain't just a little dunk tank.
[256:08.77]There's a lot going on here.
[256:12.57]With a bunch of technical difficulties?
[256:15.27]I don't think so.
[256:16.25]Because there are a bunch of engineers working on this and a full production company.
[256:21.72]So there are two different companies that are doing this.
[256:24.18]And me.
[256:25.96]So it's not just me and, hey, okay, now let me turn them on.
[256:29.90]It's probably about 10 to 15 people that are going to be on site working on this at the same time.
[256:39.74]Maybe a little bit more.
[256:42.44]Are you doing rehearsals?
[256:43.20]Yes, we are.
[256:46.48]That's why I am not going to be here for a week, because that whole week I'm going to be doing all this stuff.
[256:53.12]This whole thing is going to take a while to set up.
[256:59.59]But the clock is ticking here, it's happening real soon.
[257:02.03]I just wanna get over there, you know what I mean?
[257:07.07]You know when something's about to happen?
[257:09.39]And you know what it's gonna be, and you know what it's probably gonna look like?
[257:14.77]Every night I just go to bed and I think about it, this is gonna be fucking awesome.
[257:18.25]This is gonna be so fun, I can't wait.
[257:22.25]It's weird because it's actually made.
[257:26.66]It's almost like when I'm live, I'm just sitting here going like, I can't wait for the carnival.
[257:30.38]I can't wait for the carnival.
[257:31.12]I can't wait for the carnival.
[257:31.92]When's the carnival?
[257:32.50]I can't wait for the carnival.
[257:33.54]And it's like, shut up, dude.
[257:34.46]I'm fucking trying to stream.
[257:40.38]There's like three or four of us up here.
[257:46.66]But yeah, it's closing in.
[257:50.92]But let's continue the bits.
[257:57.14]Let me get a sip of my water and, like, blink my left eye hard.
[258:01.83]No, I'm alright.
[258:04.07]It's still there, but... I'll be good to go for tomorrow.
[258:08.33]Because that was kind of why I didn't want to push it in stream for, like, another 45 minutes to an hour.
[258:13.30]And then be in, like, a bunch of fucking pain and shit.
[258:16.78]And then it's like, oh, canceling the stream tomorrow.
[258:19.00]Sorry, guys, I can't do it.
[258:21.65]I don't want to do that.
[258:26.43]What was the reason that Cox died yesterday?
[258:28.07]I have no idea.
[258:28.85]It just was... Everything just turned off.
[258:31.91]We were just... We were at complete zero to the whole house.
[258:33.79]It was weird.
[258:38.93]Yeah, more... We're gonna... We'll finish up the FMV stuff tomorrow.
[258:42.13]And then depending how loud... Because there's at least... I think there's three... There's at least two or three other games that I want to play that are experiences that are worth doing.
[258:51.62]And then after that, we'll see.
[258:55.61]You know what?
[258:56.41]We're on DOS.
[258:57.63]Maybe... You know what?
[258:58.65]We'll do DOS tomorrow.
[259:00.59]We will do the FMV shit, and then we'll move on to DOS.
[259:04.38]From the DOS website.
[259:07.06]People have been waiting for that for a while.
[259:12.44]We'll do that, for sure.
[259:18.73]But, S10W update, thanks for the $2.50.
[259:22.35]They say, hey Jermasar, I have to sell out to Subway to give you 25 more cents.
[259:26.09]But let it be known, I do it from the heart.
[259:29.09]Anyways, I'm so happy this has been a great year for you and hope we get many more with you.
[259:33.55]Peace and love.
[259:34.21]Peace and love.
[259:35.97]Yeah.
[259:37.69]I'm...
[259:40.52]The carnival stream is the start of doing more things like that.
[259:46.25]Spending time on... There are already another two or three projects I want to do that I've actually talked to people that are currently working on this one.
[260:00.66]I have the contacts now, guys.
[260:03.13]Didn't have that shit before.
[260:05.25]Now I do.
[260:09.02]You can probably expect way more shit like this because that's the direction that I want to take the stream.
[260:18.48]I've been talking about this shit for years and not done it.
[260:23.11]So many things fell through the cracks.
[260:25.59]Working with a company and it didn't work out.
[260:27.99]Oh, that company doesn't exist anymore.
[260:30.55]Oh, this company wanted to do that, but I didn't want to do that.
[260:34.07]I've been just, I've been trying to do more high production stuff for like two or three years.
[260:40.55]And shit always just didn't work out.
[260:43.39]And it is now.
[260:48.18]So, as of September 21st, start expecting stuff like that to happen way more frequently.
[261:01.26]I don't know, I just read this, I said, I miss Basement Jerma where he was just a humble streamer.
[261:05.84]I thought that said, I miss Basement Jerma when he was just a terrible streamer.
[261:13.27]Like, I remember when he was in the basement street, he was terrible.
[261:21.21]I miss both.
[261:24.65]Yeah, but those don't have to go away.
[261:26.00]No, no, wait, hold on a second.
[261:27.82]I'm not a terrible streamer.
[261:29.10]Alright, you're working me up here.
[261:35.10]Anyways.
[261:37.00]There are more ideas that are gonna happen after this.
[261:39.08]And some of them, you know, it's gonna fucking blow you away.
[261:43.55]Just wait.
[261:44.45]You're gonna be like, your socks are just gonna like... You're gonna be sitting in your chair and it's gonna be like, my socks are gone!
[261:52.34]My socks are off!
[261:53.94]They just flew off!
[261:56.90]I didn't even do anything, I was just sitting here!
[261:58.44]It's my socks.
[262:07.94]But yeah, thank you FH Gregory for the 250.
[262:14.29]Thank you.
[262:16.00]They say, hey there, Jerram boy.
[262:17.50]I was listening to the Thursday afternoon just before Friday morning, Monday morning podcast, and I heard that Bill Burr was in Vegas a few weeks ago.
[262:25.63]I want to know if you ever got a chance to see him live.
[262:27.47]I know you mentioned in the past that you like him, or at least that he's influenced some of your comedy in a way, but maybe that's not the case anymore.
[262:34.60]Anyway, feel better with your migraine.
[262:35.88]My 52-year-old mother gets them too.
[262:38.24]Thanks and go fuck yourself.
[262:40.48]That was them saying that.
[262:41.40]That was not me saying that.
[262:42.62]Just want to make sure that the quote ends there.
[262:44.65]Okay.
[262:47.23]So, first of all, I did not see Bill Burr.
[262:52.08]I may have.
[262:54.38]I still think Bill Burr is fucking hilarious.
[262:58.64]He's such a quick... When he goes on talk shows, even, like, he's just so quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[263:04.96]It's envious how fast he can come up with something.
[263:11.27]Thank you, FH Gregory.
[263:14.81]No, actually, the only show that I've seen so far is Penn & Teller.
[263:19.77]And it was great.
[263:23.27]this many years later they've been doing that for 40 almost 45 years it was great it was just a nice show it was really nice they did a lot of cool stuff was a great show they've been around for a while they've been doing stuff for they've been still relevant
[263:51.93]You know, sometimes it's like, oh, we're gonna go see a Vegas show.
[263:55.69]Las Vegas, can't wait to see this.
[263:58.19]Who is it?
[263:59.71]Oh.
[264:01.23]Not really relevant anymore, they're just kind of doing this here.
[264:06.61]How long has it been since your last, like, single?
[264:11.06]Like, 25 years.
[264:13.70]Oh, alright, no, that's cool, I guess.
[264:17.14]But Penn & Teller, they have a TV show.
[264:19.28]They have a show that's on right now.
[264:24.42]They have never stepped out of that spotlight.
[264:31.18]Yeah, fool us.
[264:35.39]It's a pretty good show.
[264:38.55]I'm talking about Britney Spears.
[264:40.37]Are you serious?
[264:43.21]You don't talk shit about Britney Spears.
[264:45.91]Excuse me.
[264:48.90]You thought I was referencing literally the legendary Britney Spears?
[264:53.20]Guys, no.
[264:57.37]Talking about Criss Angel.
[265:11.44]Mindfreak.
[265:12.62]Although that's not a single, though.
[265:14.16]You know what?
[265:14.66]I wouldn't be surprised if Criss Angel had an album.
[265:25.26]Quick, cut his mic.
[265:30.34]Did you get your mind fucking freaked yet?
[265:34.66]Um... No.
[265:39.96]Look, if you like... If you like the Mind Freak show... Good.
[265:45.93]I'm glad.
[265:46.31]That's good.
[265:47.55]Something you like.
[265:54.67]Migraine.
[265:55.95]Mind Freak.
[266:02.94]No, I'm not gonna be one of those shit talkers that's just like, well, I don't think it's very good.
[266:07.40]It sucks.
[266:08.80]So you should think it sucks, too.
[266:11.85]Well, you don't also think it sucks, but I just told you to think it sucks.
[266:15.81]I just told you it sucks.
[266:18.25]Yeah, but I like it.
[266:19.15]But I just told you that it sucks.
[266:22.55]I know, but I like it.
[266:23.80]Yeah, but I just told you that it sucks.
[266:30.71]okay it sucks see I I knew it I told you did you get us tickets by the way I kind of want to go
[266:52.09]Anyways, thank you to... That was F.H.
[266:54.33]Gregory.
[266:54.65]No, unfortunately, I have not seen Bill Burr live.
[266:58.91]Unfortunately.
[266:59.41]I probably think it was a good show.
[267:03.64]Thank you.
[267:06.18]Etalyx for the $2.50.
[267:10.15]Appreciate it.
[267:10.57]They say, when playing Spider-Man for the PS4, you said that you disliked Stan Lee's cameos because they ruined your immersion.
[267:17.87]Well, I didn't say that I didn't like them.
[267:20.29]You also have recently said that Spider-Man Far From Home is your favorite Marvel movie.
[267:23.92]It is also the first Marvel movie to not have a Stan Lee cameo.
[267:27.70]It's an observation.
[267:30.48]Well, that's... Here's the thing.
[267:32.84]I never said that.
[267:35.50]I never said that I didn't like the Stan Lee cameo.
[267:39.27]Everybody loves the fucking Stan Lee cameos, okay?
[267:43.67]All I said was... I did not say that.
[267:46.54]I didn't say that.
[267:47.04]I said that Stan Lee cameos back, you know, this is a few years, three, four years ago, whatever it was.
[267:52.56]Or two years ago.
[267:53.12]When did Spider-Man come out?
[267:54.28]Well, anyway, so... The Spider-Man, the Stan Lee cameos, all I said was it makes you very aware that you're watching a movie.
[268:01.44]It makes you very aware that you're playing a video game.
[268:03.26]That was it.
[268:04.60]I still like them.
[268:05.52]I still think they're fun and interesting.
[268:06.99]Of course I do.
[268:17.49]When did Spider-Man come out?
[268:18.56]Well, originally... Nobody cares, you loser.
[268:27.58]Should I purge that comment?
[268:29.64]I feel like I should.
[268:30.38]Nah, leave it.
[268:33.22]Leave it.
[268:34.44]Nah, leave it.
[268:35.06]Leave it.
[268:36.94]Leave it.
[268:38.19]Don't touch.
[268:38.59]Don't.
[268:39.07]Do not.
[268:49.28]Modem.
[268:56.99]Do not.
[268:59.13]Look at how sensitive this streamer is.
[269:02.33]You know what?
[269:02.71]I am actually pretty sensitive.
[269:03.93]I might not seem it.
[269:06.96]Do you guys know that I don't... I'm serious.
[269:10.10]Do you guys know that I don't kill bugs?
[269:13.06]I'm dead serious.
[269:20.47]I don't.
[269:23.89]Unless they're trying to kill me.
[269:25.23]Okay?
[269:25.59]And the wasp is different.
[269:26.97]The wasp was trying to kill me.
[269:31.27]If it's like a life or death scenario here, the wasp is trying to murder me.
[269:36.91]Okay.
[269:45.01]Wasp stings don't kill.
[269:46.25]What if I was allergic to wasps?
[269:48.69]Excuse me.
[269:49.83]I'm not.
[269:51.72]But what if I was?
[270:00.82]What about Santa?
[270:03.12]I said I don't... I didn't kill a bug on stream and you go to Santa.
[270:07.52]Are you implying that Santa is an insect?
[270:09.28]Okay.
[270:21.74]I can't.
[270:23.28]I can't.
[270:24.13]I can't.
[270:24.61]You guys can't be funny right now.
[270:26.85]Nope.
[270:27.83]You can't be funny.
[270:29.49]Don't do it.
[270:35.29]Now, Spider-Man is my favorite universe.
[270:37.27]Far From Home is my favorite movie.
[270:40.77]Venom is one of my favorite characters.
[270:41.99]Stan Lee created some of my favorite things in my entire life.
[270:45.71]So, of course, I love Stan Lee.
[270:48.23]And every time he shows up.
[270:50.43]To answer your question.
[270:51.03]But Far From Home is the best Spider-Man movie.
[270:52.65]There's no debate there.
[270:54.33]There isn't.
[270:54.61]You don't want to debate me about this?
[271:05.84]I'll open up the debate right now.
[271:12.86]Spider-Verse is better.
[271:13.88]Spider-Verse is better.
[271:14.72]Spider-Verse.
[271:15.22]Spider-Verse.
[271:15.72]Spider-Verse.
[271:16.22]Spider-Verse.
[271:16.70]Spider-Verse.
[271:17.20]Spider-Verse.
[271:17.68]Spider-Verse.
[271:19.80]What about the Spider-Verse?
[271:22.12]I like that one too.
[271:23.52]I really like that one.
[271:24.52]That's probably the second best one.
[271:26.54]I already did a tier list.
[271:27.64]No, that's like... It goes... Far From Home.
[271:33.05]Spider-Man 1.
[271:35.56]Spider-Verse and Homecoming.
[271:36.60]No, Spider-Man... No.
[271:38.80]This four.
[271:39.20]The top four.
[271:39.86]There it is.
[271:44.14]Homecoming better than Far From Home?
[271:46.57]That's tough for me.
[271:47.35]I don't know about that.
[271:53.17]Far From Home is an overrated movie.
[271:54.47]Now I am going to purge that.
[271:57.24]I'm going to purge that one.
[272:01.52]Click.
[272:02.60]Right click.
[272:03.94]Purge comment.
[272:05.02]Click.
[272:05.74]Click.
[272:06.04]Done.
[272:07.54]Got him.
[272:09.12]Yeah, take that.
[272:17.66]I'm away from my keyboard right now.
[272:19.21]I can't do it.
[272:19.65]I'm just pretending I did it.
[272:23.13]But anyways, let's end this so I can actually go lie down.
[272:31.90]Because my brain right now is, like, working triple time.
[272:38.13]So, let's go.
[272:41.35]Where are we?
[272:44.61]Where did we end up?
[272:45.34]Oh, up here.
[272:46.06]Okay.
[272:46.56]Oh, yeah, because Phylactery came in with a shitload of subs that just g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g-g
[273:00.53]Thank you to Sin Axisted for the $5.
[273:08.74]Thank you, Sin.
[273:10.70]Hey, Jeremy, thanks for being epic and making me feel better when I need it.
[273:14.16]Love your content.
[273:15.02]Love you more.
[273:17.85]Thank you for the $5.
[273:20.31]Appreciate it.
[273:24.43]Thank you, Flugboy, for the $5.
[273:25.36]I've been trying to fix my dumb mental state lately, and I think I'm always moved at the fact that you can still manage to lift some sort of weight off of me when I can tune into a stream.
[273:38.54]I've been on a rollercoaster ride of emotions, and I will say you helped slow it down.
[273:45.67]I wish you the best.
[273:49.55]Take it slow.
[273:52.03]Work on yourself.
[273:53.62]However you know you can.
[273:54.80]Because you're the only one that knows how to do that.
[274:02.13]I am honored to lift some weight off of you and anybody else.
[274:17.02]I just want the streams to be fun.
[274:19.77]I don't... I don't care about anything else.
[274:22.77]You know what I'm saying?
[274:24.11]I want you to have fun.
[274:25.41]I want us to enjoy the streams together.
[274:27.51]I want... Obviously, I want to have fun.
[274:29.65]I want to enjoy what I'm doing.
[274:32.27]I want us to collectively think everything is a fun time.
[274:36.24]Nothing else... Nothing else matters.
[274:39.10]It really doesn't.
[274:42.28]So when people tell me that it's... They're having fun and it's like helping them and it's shit, it's...
[274:48.21]That means a lot.
[274:59.33]I like how you don't make it all about yourself.
[275:00.85]That's pretty cool.
[275:06.53]Well, it isn't.
[275:08.82]It can't be.
[275:11.84]Because you're the ones that have to be entertained.
[275:16.76]You know what I mean?
[275:17.54]As much as it's about me, it is also about you.
[275:20.86]The reason why I try to do things that might be more fun or more entertaining sometimes is because I want you to watch, like, for instance, the carnival.
[275:29.78]I'm not doing the carnival just because, oh, you know, I think I'm gonna, like, let me just, like, piss away a bunch of money.
[275:37.58]And, oh, I can't wait.
[275:39.34]This is gonna be great for me.
[275:40.78]I'm gonna have a lot of fun here.
[275:43.81]You know what?
[275:44.15]I'm not even going to turn on the stream.
[275:46.28]I think I'm just going to not turn the stream on and just have a carnival.
[275:51.72]No, it's because it's potentially a fun, interesting thing that you guys can participate in.
[275:55.32]That interests me.
[275:58.02]Look.
[275:59.88]If something interests me, I'm going to do it.
[276:07.37]It doesn't matter what it is.
[276:08.79]It's going to happen.
[276:11.28]I get so stuck and locked in on doing things that I think would be fun for the stream.
[276:17.71]Sometimes to the detriment.
[276:18.93]Sometimes to my own detriment.
[276:22.01]But then I think about, oh, but that would be fun, wouldn't it?
[276:25.72]I think people would think that was fun.
[276:27.26]I think that's fun.
[276:28.18]Maybe they would too.
[276:30.06]That's all I need to hear.
[276:30.84]That's all I need to know.
[276:40.95]That's why he spent five million dollars on the carnival.
[276:48.60]I mean... I think you're pretty close.
[276:58.76]But... No, for real, I... I wouldn't be doing it... If I wasn't having a good time and it didn't interest me.
[277:12.69]And if it wasn't interesting, you.
[277:13.77]Because I don't know, you know, I don't want to have one of those, I don't want to have like a stream where it's just like, every day it's just like, hey, I don't like this at all.
[277:24.41]Oh, okay.
[277:29.22]Wait, what?
[277:29.74]I don't want that, I don't want you to do that.
[277:32.83]Now, some streams will be more exciting, I think, than others.
[277:38.73]And I can't have something crazy fucking... Like, I can't have, like, a carnival stream every fucking stream.
[277:44.36]That's impossible.
[277:51.24]But it is on my mind all the time.
[277:57.88]But thank you.
[278:01.08]Why not?
[278:03.64]Now you are talking five million dollars.
[278:07.46]That number is real, if that is the case.
[278:22.87]But thank you, Flugboy.
[278:24.74]Thank you, FutureGamer, for the 250.
[278:26.08]What is the current sub count at?
[278:27.76]Also, how many emote slots has Phylactery opened on their own?
[278:30.21]We're currently at 5,875 subs.
[278:31.55]74 subs.
[278:31.67]We are currently down from the peak of about 7,000.
[278:33.53]Which was just fucking crazy.
[278:34.53]If you remember that.
[278:52.33]Do you guys remember like four months ago when I had like seven fucking thousand subs?
[279:04.83]That was fucking crazy So it's we've kind of evened out a little bit here Add another fucking crazy number
[279:22.44]When did it get so high?
[279:23.96]This year.
[279:28.34]It fluctuates, though.
[279:30.51]So it'll go... I can't give you an exact... I mean, that's the current snapshot of subscribers right now.
[279:39.68]A month or two from now, that might drop a couple thousand.
[279:42.64]It might go up a couple thousand.
[279:44.84]I have no idea.
[279:46.08]It's kind of all over the place when it comes to just like exact numbers.
[279:51.62]It's kind of hard to tell.
[279:53.94]But there are 5874 right this second.
[279:59.24]I haven't even begun to peak.
[280:01.84]Followers per month is increasing too.
[280:03.73]Well, cool, good.
[280:05.77]I hope you like the streams because that's all I'm going to do.
[280:09.69]That's all.
[280:10.13]I'm just... I'm gonna stream.
[280:11.11]You know what I mean?
[280:14.71]Like, if people come in and they like it, then I think that's good.
[280:24.89]Too much information, but do you ever not break even on big projects?
[280:30.32]I don't... I mean, it's a... I don't know.
[280:32.18]It's hard to answer that.
[280:33.86]Because...
[280:36.46]Like, on September 21st, am I going to make back the money that I spent on this stream?
[280:43.48]No.
[280:44.79]I would say absolutely not.
[280:47.35]Absolute zero.
[280:49.59]Will I make that back in the year?
[280:55.45]Six months?
[280:56.42]I don't know.
[280:56.88]Maybe.
[280:57.40]Probably.
[280:58.20]I don't know.
[281:01.54]I don't know.
[281:03.28]I don't even... I'm not thinking about that.
[281:09.20]I'm doing alright though, guys.
[281:10.32]Don't worry about me in that regard.
[281:13.68]I wouldn't do this shit if I wasn't able to.
[281:16.86]So let me make that really, really clear first.
[281:33.89]Bald coin is spiking.
[281:40.05]What kind of car do you drive?
[281:41.53]I drive a ha- oh... Almost got it!
[281:46.33]You got this qu- oh!
[281:47.67]Almost had it!
[281:48.29]Why does everybody care about the car that I drive?
[282:06.26]A Honda 2- A Honda 2000!
[282:12.37]No, guys, I drive the gerbil car.
[282:16.23]He drives a Honda Omega.
[282:17.86]What's wrong with a Honda?
[282:20.74]What's wrong with a Honda?
[282:23.64]Excuse me, purge that.
[282:27.18]I don't want to see that.
[282:31.90]It's a quality car.
[282:33.62]What the fuck?
[282:36.31]That's all I have to say.
[282:42.69]But thank you too.
[282:45.03]That was Future Gamer.
[282:46.49]Currently have an absolute shitload of subs and you guys see it every stream.
[282:51.18]You see this shit pop up every damn stream and I can't fucking believe it every time.
[282:55.38]So why don't we show it now?
[282:58.94]Those of you wondering.
[283:00.62]All the people that and the community support, the community subs, the first time subs, the long time subs.
[283:07.41]This is it right here.
[283:09.85]It's like this every fucking single time.
[283:14.79]So that's where that comes from.
[283:18.14]Thank you to all of you.
[283:23.30]Thank you, Unreal!
[283:29.55]20 more from Phylactery.
[283:32.57]Holy shit, dude.
[283:38.55]He's back.
[283:39.19]Alright.
[283:40.15]That's your... Way too many gifted subs.
[283:47.06]You have filled the gifted sub mana bar.
[283:52.79]It's an early Bitcoin adopter.
[283:58.33]But, oh, phylactery, holy shit, that's more.
[284:00.73]Thank you for that.
[284:04.10]I gotta use my ult.
[284:07.38]Yeah, you'll see the ult soon.
[284:11.76]What happens when you run out of people to gift subs to?
[284:14.50]I don't know.
[284:16.94]Does it just pick random people on Twitch?
[284:23.41]Huh.
[284:23.59]I didn't even think about that.
[284:27.89]But File Actor, again, 89 community subs tonight.
[284:32.25]That's almost 100 fucking subs.
[284:35.73]That's... I can't even imagine that many people... You understand?
[284:44.00]Thank you.
[284:47.51]Hey, Flugboy.
[284:48.81]No, actually, it was Unreal Leviathan because that huge sub drop just came in.
[284:53.21]Thanks for the 10 bucks, Unreal Leviathan.
[284:56.64]I don't know how I'm going to make it through the next couple weeks, but I've got your lovely self, Jeremy.
[285:00.48]Love you.
[285:09.08]Much love to you.
[285:12.14]Right back at you.
[285:16.98]I'm not sure what's going on over the next couple weeks, but hopefully you can figure it out.
[285:26.45]I wish you the best.
[285:29.93]Thank you so much for the support.
[285:40.63]Who in here is subbed because of Phylactery Lich?
[285:42.85]Hundreds of you are, so...
[285:46.36]There are a lot of you that are subbed because they're giving out subs.
[285:57.38]But thank you, Unreal Leviathan, for the $10.
[286:01.32]Take care.
[286:01.92]Thank you, Flugboy, for the $2.50.
[286:03.26]I will say the time I got to meet you at PAX and I called your name from the crosswalk above and you looked up at me and said something stupid like it kind of was a weird feeling like I was seeing a friend after a long time.
[286:18.21]I actually do remember that.
[286:20.21]I thought I did something wrong, I think, right?
[286:24.49]I remember I walked in, and I was just kind of, had like a coffee in my hand, and I just heard like, Hey!
[286:29.47]Like, Gemma!
[286:30.33]Hey!
[286:31.44]And I'm just looking, I'm like, what did I do?
[286:32.50]I did something wrong.
[286:33.26]Like, I did security's coming.
[286:34.28]What did I do?
[286:34.64]I didn't do anything.
[286:35.44]Something wrong?
[286:40.26]And then we just hung out.
[286:45.78]You walked in, he's a criminal.
[286:46.74]There he is.
[286:47.30]Get him.
[286:48.67]No coffee.
[286:49.23]I was like, yeah, but was it the coffee?
[286:51.69]Is it like the movie theater?
[286:53.67]Are you mad that I didn't buy it here?
[286:56.09]Security guard calling you Jerma.
[287:00.48]Hey, Jerma!
[287:01.74]Jerma, you're in big trouble.
[287:03.16]I get to be the one that arrests Jerma.
[287:05.42]I can't wait.
[287:07.60]He gets me in coffee.
[287:09.12]Hey, can I get a selfie?
[287:11.20]No, no, get the fucking... I didn't want a fucking picture.
[287:17.83]TwitchCon!
[287:18.57]2019!
[287:19.81]This motherfucker brought coffee in!
[287:33.48]I was baffled by the fact that anyone could drink espresso shots back when I met you, and now like two years later I have one every other morning.
[287:42.19]Yeah, espresso's great.
[287:43.87]It's easy, it's quick.
[287:46.18]You can do a shot of espresso.
[287:47.24]You can just sip on a shot of espresso and it's just done.
[287:49.20]That's it.
[287:49.86]It's hot.
[287:51.62]Takes three, four, five sips.
[287:54.10]Alright, that was nice.
[287:55.27]Done.
[287:55.75]It's over.
[287:56.35]I'm done.
[287:56.69]I don't have to do any more than that.
[288:01.89]But you do.
[288:02.25]You'll probably get a second one.
[288:04.53]A few hours later.
[288:08.88]That's a Seinfeld bit.
[288:10.24]If it is, then what a smart comedian.
[288:12.82]Because it's true.
[288:18.04]Uh, Phylactery, the $50 donation you gave earlier has a comment on it, and I want to say it.
[288:24.81]They say, I'm like an old-school art patron, and you're my Michelangelo, Jerma.
[288:29.11]Make art for me, my boy.
[288:35.77]An art patron.
[288:38.89]Yeah, but the difference is, I'm not making Michelangelo.
[288:41.13]I'm scribbling crayons.
[288:44.90]On the back of your electric bill.
[288:48.22]And putting it on the fridge, hoping that you're proud of me.
[288:59.98]But they're good scribbles.
[289:01.04]Hey, thank you.
[289:02.68]I tried.
[289:07.13]You're the elephant at the zoo that learned how to hold a paintbrush.
[289:17.31]Uh, thank you to Lieutenant Campbell for the 250.
[289:19.99]Hey, Jerma, sorry I can't give as much as the Pimp Lord, but... What do you mean, Pimp Lord?
[289:25.62]I got it, uh... I can't give as much as the Pimp Lord.
[289:32.68]Anyways.
[289:33.76]But I got into a car wreck recently and need to save for some crap wagon.
[289:39.07]Take my pocket change and apply directly to the forehead to ease your migraine.
[289:44.09]Brain pain is no joke.
[289:45.23]I've been watching you since your TF2 days back in 2011 and just wanted to let you know how much of a beacon of joy you've been through the years.
[289:52.28]Never stop being the amazing person you are.
[289:56.92]Actually, yeah, I will go take Tylenol.
[289:58.98]That's not a bad idea.
[290:02.61]That's not a bad idea.
[290:05.87]But, um, sorry to hear about your car accident.
[290:12.68]Uh, please continue to save money.
[290:15.28]Get yourself a new set of wheels.
[290:16.86]Hopefully you're okay.
[290:17.50]Hopefully everyone's okay.
[290:20.51]And just to let you know, I mean, like, if you're in the market for a car, I would say a Honda.
[290:30.85]I've heard things, I've heard stuff on the radio about how Hondas are very reliable cars.
[290:39.27]I've read a couple articles.
[290:40.57]I've seen some retweets on Honda.
[290:51.80]I think they're very competitively priced.
[290:57.40]I would just recommend one.
[291:07.05]But thank you, Lieutenant Campbell, for the $2.50.
[291:09.23]I ain't getting smaller.
[291:11.23]The day that I start getting smaller is the day that I start putting fucking little things in my shoes.
[291:15.33]I ain't ever gonna be smaller than 5'8".
[291:16.53]Uh-uh.
[291:36.31]When I turn 60 and I shrink an inch and a half, I'm putting in like something in my shoes.
[291:40.24]I'm getting special shoes to be like an inch taller.
[291:49.88]They're gonna... They're gonna bury me at 5'8".
[292:04.16]I'll be 5'8", like 89, 90 years old.
[292:07.33]Gotta live to be fuckin' 90, 97.
[292:12.25]They're gonna bury you standing up.
[292:24.41]Yeah, I want my casket vertical.
[292:36.80]Hey, thank you to... Thank you to Ding Dang for the $10.
[292:40.85]What an awesome opportunity for me to talk about this.
[292:45.03]You ready?
[292:45.33]The... community...
[293:06.41]content channel is going to open tomorrow before the stream let's go I can't do it loud I'm gonna get that open tomorrow what this channel will be for there'll be rules there'll be pinned message there read them
[293:34.69]This will be for any community content which at some point over the month, once maybe, once or twice a month, depending on how much stuff we compile, we will do a community hangout night.
[293:51.70]Probably once a month.
[293:55.49]Where we watch and observe and consume all of this community media.
[294:06.80]Another emote contest.
[294:09.00]No.
[294:10.90]It's possible that we can... No, I'm not going to give any... I'm going to burp.
[294:16.27]I'm not going to give any spoilers.
[294:21.47]I have awful internet.
[294:22.27]Please, what is he saying?
[294:23.01]I'll write it out.
[294:25.97]No, I can't do that.
[294:27.07]My brain's too fucked up right now to do that.
[294:31.47]But no, I'm going to get it open tomorrow.
[294:35.16]it'll be in the same realm as the recommended channel where you would just put your submission with like a sentence or two it's not there for discussion it's not there to talk about it it's there to just put it there put a little description of what it is and that's it and we'll go over them and I and the mods will over the over you know the 30 day period we'll come up with a good hey let's sit back and relax and watch with a fucking comb in my hair
[295:03.32]What about the discussion of said content?
[295:06.70]Um, that's a good question.
[295:07.86]I mean, I've... We kind of... We'll do that on stream.
[295:11.16]You know what I mean?
[295:15.26]I think that's part of it, is once those things come through, we can just kind of hang out and talk about them on stream.
[295:23.37]But, couple more bits to go through.
[295:25.71]We had, uh... BC Pox?
[295:29.71]BSI?
[295:30.55]BC Pox for the $5?
[295:33.20]been a long time second you viewer but watching the streams the last few days has been great keep it up yeah maybe we'll see you tomorrow we'll keep going tomorrow I had to cut it early today again for the second day in a row so I'm sorry about that finally we had um
[296:00.60]Thank you to... Whenever you get a scale like this one, you get a migraine.
[296:07.64]You get a wall that you have to climb over with every other sentence.
[296:12.35]Sometimes it's like that.
[296:13.51]It's annoying.
[296:20.07]Oh, and then... Oh yeah, that's what I was going to say.
[296:26.10]It's irritating.
[296:27.04]Thank you, Wing, for the $2.50.
[296:30.59]Hey Jerma, I have meme cheered a lot in the past, but I want to tell you how much you make my life brighter with all that you do.
[296:37.17]I'm going to have to end my sub for a bit because of money problems, but I want to truly thank you for your humor and how it makes me want to be more like you.
[296:44.46]I'm sure there are many in the community that feel the same way.
[296:46.94]Thank you.
[296:49.40]Thank you for fucking subscribing.
[296:55.94]That is a completely optional thing.
[297:03.31]If you ever need to end your sub, that's... I'm shocked and honored and thankful that you even thought to do it in the first place.
[297:15.44]Thank you.
[297:24.12]What was their name?
[297:26.12]It was Wing... Wing, uh... Chin.
[297:30.95]Wing Ching.
[297:33.47]250.
[297:33.57]I think I'm saying that.
[297:35.83]Am I saying that right?
[297:39.25]His name was Wing.
[297:50.59]Thank you.
[297:52.75]I tried to gift them a sub.
[297:55.37]Aw, look at you, Tingy.
[298:00.94]But don't worry, if you can't sub to the channel, just hang out and have fun.
[298:05.08]That's completely and totally fucking 100% all good.
[298:11.13]No one is ever under any obligation to pay this channel money.
[298:15.91]Don't do it if you can't.
[298:17.39]If you were and you didn't, and now you do or you don't, don't worry about it.
[298:33.84]Thank you for your $2.50 and thank you for your sub.
[298:39.06]And I will see you guys tomorrow.
[298:45.00]We'll pick back up.
[298:46.67]Where we left off, I'm going to go put my head down and just exist for a little while.
[298:52.45]Probably get some food too.
[298:55.13]You know what?
[298:57.21]It must have been the beer, right?
[298:58.93]It had to have been.
[299:01.07]I drank a Coors Light.
[299:05.44]I don't drink beer.
[299:06.12]I don't know.
[299:09.52]That was weird.
[299:15.36]Drunk off of one Coors Light.
[299:29.01]You gotta maintain the buzz.
[299:31.11]No, no, no, no.
[299:35.65]Well, I had, you know, I had one Coors Light.
[299:39.99]And it gave me a fucking migraine.
[299:45.19]I don't, that's like not funny.
[299:47.27]But I don't know why it is.
[299:48.37]I'm not gonna drink, I'm never gonna drink this beer.
[300:01.08]No, it's not the beer, it's like the, my body today.
[300:06.82]Guys, you guys have watched me drink like a whole bottle of wine on stream before.
[300:10.13]It's not alcohol.
[300:11.03]But maybe it is this time.
[300:12.63]I don't know.
[300:13.25]I'll see you tomorrow.
[300:15.13]Have a great night, guys.
[300:15.97]See you soon.
[300:44.96]Thank you.
