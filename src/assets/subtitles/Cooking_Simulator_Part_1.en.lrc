[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.17]So I'm thinking about a new intro screen that starts to play a loud, like, Fall Out Boy song.
[00:10.29]And it gets progressively louder and louder, starting at, like, 60 seconds, until it is unbearably loud.
[00:16.52]And every time, like, another number counts down on the screen, it starts at 60.
[00:20.84]Once we get to, like, 15, the numbers start to fucking get huge, and, like, a big bass just explosion happens on every countdown.
[00:28.44]It's like, 15!
[00:28.90]Boom!
[00:30.82]BOOM!
[00:31.28]And Fall Out Boy gets louder and louder and louder.
[00:33.92]Until it gets to zero and then I come in and I'm like, HEY EVERYBODY, WELCOME TO THE STREAM!
[00:38.95]You guys like that?
[00:39.67]Or, should I put that one in a box and never open it again?
[00:41.95]I was thinking about it, it sounds like pretty good, right?
[00:49.32]Yeah, there's like this fucking crumbs all over my chest and like all over my mouth.
[00:59.45]I don't know why that would be there, but it is.
[01:03.41]I get that one in the box.
[01:04.29]Hey, how you doing, guys?
[01:08.65]You know how to... Okay, I'm going to give you guys a tutorial on how to do the YouTuber and streamer yell.
[01:14.73]So you start normally, like this, right?
[01:17.85]And then almost pretend like you're yelling into a wall.
[01:21.29]Or like, have you ever yelled into a pillow?
[01:24.97]Pretend like the inside of your mouth is a pillow that you're yelling into.
[01:30.31]So instead of being like, welcome to the stream, that's a fucking yell.
[01:34.51]I just yelled.
[01:36.21]It's welcome to the stream.
[01:38.95]Almost like you use your teeth as like a pretend muffler.
[01:54.04]It's how I used to do it.
[01:54.76]How do you think I got- How do you think I made fucking 50 trillion views on YouTube?
[02:00.02]By doing the yell into the fucking teeth, muffle my voice YouTube yell.
[02:17.27]Do you even know how to cook?
[02:18.07]This is cooking simulator.
[02:28.70]Just taking a sip of my coffee, hanging out here.
[02:31.03]Well, I just made a tweet.
[02:31.99]I'm pretty much ready to go.
[02:36.35]Came out today.
[02:37.17]Yes, it actually did release today.
[02:40.51]We don't have to pretend like I'm going to stream this yesterday like I thought I was going to.
[02:43.75]It is now out.
[02:44.45]It's installed.
[02:45.06]I actually have it up on the screen right now, but I'm not going to show you yet.
[02:55.14]Show it.
[02:55.44]Not yet.
[02:56.78]It's not ready.
[02:57.34]It's not time.
[03:04.15]Not Hearthstone.
[03:05.53]That was still fun, though.
[03:06.39]I had a good time.
[03:13.54]Well, here.
[03:13.88]How about this?
[03:14.58]Ready?
[03:17.74]We already got right off the bat.
[03:19.26]I've been waiting for this game for a long time.
[03:20.57]We got some great music.
[03:28.07]This is such unbelievably perfect in-between announcements at the wedding music.
[03:38.12]I'll give you an example.
[03:40.72]So, for instance... Okay, ladies and gentlemen, that was it for the first dance, and your server will be coming around with the first course of dinner.
[03:49.38]Enjoy it!
[03:50.80]We'll see you soon for the son and mother dance.
[03:57.92]It's every single one.
[04:03.02]And for some weird reason, this stays on the whole time.
[04:08.55]Even when you're eating.
[04:13.97]I don't know why they do that.
[04:16.11]Put on something like fucking Beethoven or something.
[04:17.81]That'd be more appropriate, right?
[04:23.61]Anyway, we've wasted enough time.
[04:29.12]I'm gonna spend a little bit of time on this one, guys, because I've been waiting for this for fucking ever.
[04:38.49]Cooking Simulator is the game that I've been waiting for.
[04:41.19]This is my most anticipated game of 2019.
[04:43.65]Now, it's not fucking Anthem 2 or whatever the hell is coming out.
[04:50.31]It's not like... It's not Destiny... Put a line through the two... And put it back on Steam.
[04:56.92]No.
[05:02.34]It's this.
[05:03.92]So what should I do?
[05:04.86]Cooking school?
[05:05.36]Let me turn it up a little bit.
[05:07.92]It's a little soft.
[05:08.74]There we go.
[05:17.08]Let's do cooking school.
[05:19.62]Seasoning.
[05:20.24]If you have no idea what this game is, it's a cooking simulator.
[05:27.34]That's it.
[05:28.87]There's nothing else.
[05:34.70]No shit, wow.
[05:36.28]Okay, now it's really loud.
[05:38.63]Today's lesson is short, but the skill you'll learn with it will determine whether you get tips or have to wrestle the guests for money.
[05:44.41]Let's learn the basics how to season food.
[05:46.13]What do you mean, wrestle the guests for money?
[05:48.91]They're gonna steal?
[05:49.73]Target the salt container.
[05:50.97]Notice the number under the label.
[05:52.77]It shows how much spice is left in the container.
[05:56.41]There's 500 gold in here.
[05:59.27]Okay.
[06:01.38]Now sprinkle the salmon and use the container to enter sprinkle mode.
[06:07.22]Alright, so this is sprinkle mode.
[06:12.27]Now for the actual seasoning.
[06:14.29]Aim for the fillet and use the container until you season the fish with three grams of salt.
[06:24.27]Three.
[06:25.05]That was easy, wasn't it?
[06:25.87]It gets a lot harder when the product is cut into pieces.
[06:27.91]Better practice your aim then.
[06:31.88]What?
[06:39.98]That's not too much salt.
[06:43.48]Alright, so let's make a dish.
[06:49.21]I am so fucking excited, you have no idea.
[06:51.51]Why is everything blue?
[06:54.25]Take a stab, you've served your first dish.
[06:55.65]Don't worry, I'll be here to guide you through the whole process.
[06:58.64]This isn't a test, but if you run into trouble performing any task, try one of the earlier lessons.
[07:02.72]Alright, like seasoning the fish.
[07:07.04]Steak with a side of french fries.
[07:08.52]Simple yet nuanced.
[07:09.84]There's no actual guest waiting, so you can take your time.
[07:12.52]Simple yet nuanced.
[07:17.41]Look behind you, that's the checkout window.
[07:20.65]Once we're done, you'll need to place the order on the shelf and use the tablet to confirm.
[07:24.79]Simple yet nuanced.
[07:27.32]I don't think there's anything nuanced about getting a frozen food section, bag of french fries, and a steak.
[07:33.15]I don't think that's very nuanced.
[07:39.03]Look, someone ordered a dish.
[07:40.26]Every time a client orders something, you'll be notified in the upper left corner of the screen.
[07:45.65]Notifications will also appear when you have only a minute left to complete a dish, you're slightly late, or when a client gives up waiting and goes home.
[07:53.61]Imagine it takes that long for someone to make you food that you go home.
[08:01.14]That's it.
[08:01.82]That's your order.
[08:02.34]Walk up to the display and press on the... Steak with french fries.
[08:10.34]Take a good look at the screen.
[08:11.12]To the left, you've got a list of ingredients.
[08:13.44]And to the right, what do you have to do with them?
[08:15.64]Don't worry, we'll do it step by step.
[08:17.74]First, take the steak out of the refrigerator.
[08:22.08]Imagine you order like steak and french fries from a place and like two hours go by.
[08:26.55]You just leave.
[08:27.43]Why would you wait that long?
[08:29.91]I have a very strict policy on if the food is not out in fucking 30 minutes or less.
[08:37.45]Goodbye.
[08:39.87]If fuckin' Pizza Hut, 20 years ago, could come up with that idea.
[08:44.87]30 minutes or it's free.
[08:46.30]You can't make a fuckin' steak in 30 to 40 minutes?
[08:49.38]I don't think so.
[08:53.34]Pizza Hut fuckin' made that a reality.
[08:56.08]Alright, let's get a steak.
[08:59.74]What, we only have two?
[09:00.61]What does C mean?
[09:01.29]Is this the quality of the meat?
[09:04.40]Try not to go bankrupt.
[09:06.34]Almost everything in the kitchen costs money.
[09:08.06]Plates, products, and especially repairs.
[09:10.46]Don't take more than you need and keep an eye on your balance.
[09:13.75]Once you're out of money, you're out of business.
[09:16.29]What is C?
[09:18.89]Okay, take the steak out of the fridge.
[09:20.21]What is C?
[09:24.39]Is it sense?
[09:25.05]Alright, put down on the cutting board.
[09:31.20]Now pick up the salt and use it on the steak.
[09:32.82]4G.
[09:35.78]Why don't I... Never mind.
[09:38.26]Alright, gotta get this right.
[09:42.05]Pretty good.
[09:43.95]Now let's have some black pepper.
[09:45.19]Again, we'll need four grams on the steak.
[09:47.03]Okay, so... Black pepper.
[09:51.13]Put this down.
[09:53.09]Pepper.
[09:53.61]Four grams.
[09:59.59]Still on the safe spot.
[10:02.20]Okay, I did it.
[10:04.63]Time to heat things up.
[10:05.35]Turn on the griddle.
[10:06.19]It's right next to the fridge.
[10:07.91]Alright, put that down.
[10:12.29]Here's the griddle.
[10:13.67]Okay, turn it on.
[10:15.15]Put the steak on the griddle.
[10:18.49]Target the steak to view its state.
[10:19.89]That green bar indicates that the food is cooked.
[10:24.08]The little pan icon informs you that it's been fried.
[10:27.48]Look up.
[10:28.22]There's a spatula hanging above the griddle.
[10:29.74]Take it.
[10:34.52]Precise handling of tools in the kitchen is crucial.
[10:43.59]Holding down shift will open up new ways to manipulate whatever you are currently holding in your hand.
[10:56.79]I'll shift this like a context menu.
[10:58.87]We want to fry both sides of the steak, so we need to flip it.
[11:01.32]Target the steak, use the spatula.
[11:02.60]Once the steak is on the spatula, target the griddle and enter context.
[11:05.40]Hold the key to flip... Alright, hold on.
[11:20.29]The steak is done?
[11:21.01]It's done!
[11:22.49]Go and find some plate of paint that should be on the storage shelf.
[11:25.67]Do I take this off?
[11:27.17]Is it cooked?
[11:28.87]Shit.
[11:32.55]Alright, got it.
[11:38.36]We need a plate.
[11:39.68]Okay, plate.
[11:43.60]Put this down for a second.
[11:49.21]Move, move, move, I'm moving.
[11:51.71]How do I put this down?
[12:00.19]Okay, back we go.
[12:00.97]Target the steak and... Target the steak and plate it.
[12:04.95]Okay, put it down.
[12:11.08]Put it down.
[12:23.07]Put down... Put container down.
[12:24.89]I just want to put it down.
[12:25.87]Alright.
[12:29.40]Pick up product.
[12:35.38]Why can't I pick it up?
[12:36.99]I need the spatula to pick this up.
[12:38.37]Where's the spatula?
[12:45.13]I think I broke the tutorial.
[12:51.51]Target the steak and use the plate.
[12:53.21]Wait.
[12:58.11]I'm too tall.
[13:09.67]Turn the fucking oven off.
[13:11.79]Alright, now what?
[13:12.99]Oh, you might put it over here.
[13:16.28]Now take the cutting board.
[13:20.12]Alright, I got the cutting board.
[13:22.80]Go to the pantry and buy two potatoes.
[13:26.25]Potato one.
[13:27.73]Potato two.
[13:29.67]Alright, now take them back to the countertop.
[13:31.45]We'll need to cut them.
[13:35.54]I feel like my body is fucking so far away.
[13:38.30]Do I have the FOV too high?
[13:39.72]Okay, here we go.
[13:52.55]You want me to just cut him?
[13:56.29]Okay, cut.
[13:59.23]Holy shit, this is unbelievable.
[14:02.54]We don't want, we want, how many pieces?
[14:03.90]10?
[14:03.92]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[14:04.34]How do I, hold on, rotate that around.
[14:06.89]9, 10.
[14:30.60]Walk up to the deep fryer, press the button to... Alright, the tutorials kind of just, like, launch up at the top of the screen.
[14:36.72]Turn on the deep fryer?
[14:40.19]What did that even just say?
[14:41.09]Okay, to the left is a fryer basket.
[14:48.93]Pick up all the potato pieces, put them into the basket, and just target them and use the basket, okay.
[15:01.29]What?
[15:04.56]Why are they going through?
[15:10.06]Am I insane?
[15:11.28]Why did I fall?
[15:12.10]Okay, expand pickup range.
[15:26.25]Expand pickup range.
[15:30.20]Oh, okay.
[15:32.06]I don't want this other whole potato, though.
[15:36.26]Target deep fry.
[15:37.00]Place the basket inside.
[15:40.78]Now let's wait for the fries to cook.
[15:42.44]They're supposed to be French fries.
[15:43.62]Oh.
[15:45.56]Get the plate with the steak.
[15:46.28]Are these done?
[16:09.30]How do I do it?
[16:10.38]Rotate.
[16:13.80]This is so funny.
[16:15.12]I love this.
[16:16.14]Okay.
[16:16.84]You guess would be long gone by now.
[16:22.50]Yeah, well, I'm just learning the tools.
[16:26.54]Now to finish the dish, go to the herb shelves in the pantry and add two rosemary twigs.
[16:32.20]This looks fucking terrible.
[16:34.34]I have two gigantic potato pieces.
[16:37.28]It's supposed to be fries.
[16:40.70]whatever alright what do you want two twigs done I was I don't know why I was making potato chips alright here we go order up take a photo of your dish
[17:13.21]I can fix this Context guys
[17:52.15]Alright, click.
[17:55.91]Look at how good that looks.
[17:58.10]Save that one.
[18:00.74]Alright, order up.
[18:02.04]Steak with fries.
[18:02.78]You need to place the dish on the checkout counter left of the exit.
[18:10.74]Yeah, okay.
[18:11.63]Look at that.
[18:13.51]They didn't even know that half of that shit touched the ground.
[18:19.54]How many fame points were given for this dish?
[18:21.22]The better the restaurant, the higher the quality of dishes you need to prepare to earn any fame.
[18:25.92]Poorly made meals will lower your fame rating.
[18:29.10]Taste.
[18:29.88]Determined by the technical and thermal quality of the dish.
[18:32.74]I cooked it to perfection almost.
[18:34.94]Cooking points.
[18:36.03]How many points do you need to learn new dishes?
[18:38.47]The better you cook, the quicker you can unlock new recipes.
[18:41.73]Nine cooking points.
[18:43.39]Some paid for the dish by the client.
[18:45.93]45 cents.
[18:46.99]Tip.
[18:47.33]A sign that the client liked the dish.
[18:50.41]Any complaints?
[18:52.49]Guest complaints.
[18:53.23]French fries where there weren't enough salt on the french fries and there were some heating mistakes.
[18:58.39]The temperature was perfect.
[18:59.30]But how does that make any sense?
[19:02.38]You want five star quality food.
[19:04.76]Go to fucking Burger King.
[19:07.78]How does it feel?
[19:08.28]Ready to take on the challenge of the kitchen in your own?
[19:09.80]If not, you can always come back for a lesson or two.
[19:11.44]Cool.
[19:11.72]Okay.
[19:12.32]So I think I'm understanding.
[19:21.82]Advanced buying.
[19:22.70]Alright.
[19:23.88]There's only a couple more.
[19:26.82]Buying items through the shop UI.
[19:31.52]I've shown you previously how to buy products from shelves.
[19:33.40]However, not everything can be found just lying around.
[19:37.40]This guy looks mean.
[19:38.82]Today you'll learn how to buy everything you'll need and more.
[19:42.94]See that cardboard box?
[19:44.06]I need you to walk up to it.
[19:48.56]Now target box, okay.
[19:50.12]That's a shop.
[19:50.72]This is the shop.
[19:51.75]Ooh, look at this.
[19:52.67]Look at all this fresh ingredients.
[19:54.35]This is the shop screen.
[19:55.21]Items split into four categories and by default are sorted alphabetically.
[20:01.71]Spices and liquids can only be bought here and they come only in larger amounts.
[20:05.59]So be prepared to pay a handsome fee.
[20:08.01]If you have trouble keeping track of your tools and pots, you can buy additional ones from the utensils tab.
[20:12.01]Be aware that quality doesn't come cheap.
[20:16.45]Now go to the liquids tab.
[20:18.53]Avocado oil.
[20:19.31]The tabs at the bottom of the menu determine the sorting order.
[20:21.65]I want you to select the right most sorting tab.
[20:24.48]Okay.
[20:27.40]Products should not be sold according to their price.
[20:29.77]Descending.
[20:31.15]If you haven't noticed, prices are denoted to the far right in green or red if you don't have sufficient funds.
[20:38.27]I want you to get avocado oil from this list.
[20:41.36]Buy it.
[20:42.66]Bottle of avocado oil.
[20:45.46]Leave the shop view.
[20:46.66]You can buy only one item at a time.
[20:47.96]No tricks with a container this time.
[20:49.70]Okay.
[20:51.56]Don't forget this lesson.
[20:52.34]Many items can only be bought this way.
[20:59.87]I was gonna just rake it.
[21:01.69]Alright, now what I want you to do is I want you to chug the avocado oil.
[21:06.09]And when you do it, look right into the camera.
[21:10.04]And I want you to say... Alright, never mind.
[21:22.87]Last one.
[21:23.23]Today I'll give you a quick tour of the kitchen.
[21:24.93]Stay focused.
[21:25.73]You need to memorize all of this.
[21:27.07]Great.
[21:27.73]We can't have you wandering about searching stuff while the guests are waiting.
[21:29.95]Oh god, I'm gonna fucking ruin everything.
[21:32.83]Go to the marker.
[21:35.55]Here you find mostly vegetables, some fruit, bread, and buns.
[21:37.77]Some of the products you will need to unlock by learning new recipes.
[21:40.14]Look at that fucking pantry.
[21:41.60]That's an envious pantry.
[21:43.60]Remember that you'll need to pay for the products and be sure to bring a container if you want to carry more than one piece.
[21:50.92]Here you will find plate stacks.
[21:52.70]And again, you have to pay for every single one.
[21:55.40]Once the dish is served, the price of the plate will be added back to your account.
[21:58.76]Fucking expenses.
[22:00.26]You can also use plates to carry things around the kitchen, but be careful these things break easy.
[22:06.18]Even more important are the cardboard boxes.
[22:08.04]Trouble finding something?
[22:09.04]You can buy one from a box.
[22:12.92]These shelves are used for storing herbs.
[22:15.17]Just as with everything else, the herbs have to be purchased.
[22:17.47]You pay for every twig or leaf you take.
[22:21.35]Go to the next marker.
[22:22.75]Okay, I need to get reading comprehension here.
[22:26.89]Fruits and vegetables are here.
[22:29.17]I can grab them, they cost money.
[22:31.73]Oils, seasonings, spices, alright here.
[22:36.14]Herbs, right here.
[22:38.06]Plates, if I can't find like a fucking tomato in here, if I can't see the tomato, then I go here and I can just, it's a big list.
[22:47.45]Okay, in case there's a fire, break out the fire.
[22:52.23]This is the refrigerator.
[22:53.17]Here you can buy fish, meat, cheese, and fruit.
[22:55.09]Some of the products are hidden in the drawers at the bottom of the fridge.
[22:57.51]Okay, so all the meats and cheeses and stuff are in the fridge.
[23:03.18]The griddle is used for searing and frying.
[23:05.22]As long as the recipe doesn't call for any fat, such as oil, most meat needs to be fried on both sides, so don't forget to flip it.
[23:13.58]The stove is your best friend.
[23:14.64]Here you can boil, fry, grill with the right pan, of course.
[23:18.50]Under the stove there's even a backup oven.
[23:21.94]Remember that pots and pans come in different shapes and sizes.
[23:24.54]Just because there are six burners doesn't mean you'll fit six containers on the stove at the same time.
[23:30.55]This is really, really detailed.
[23:33.99]There's so much in this game.
[23:35.55]I, like, already love it.
[23:37.11]If you wish, you can cut on any flat surface.
[23:39.59]Just grab a knife.
[23:40.45]However, what did that say?
[23:41.43]However.
[23:43.49]Pans are up below that.
[23:45.41]What did that say?
[23:47.41]There are pots stored on another shelf in the floor.
[23:49.24]Alright, what did that say?
[23:56.53]Use the cutting board.
[23:57.33]But he said, however, the ground is preferred.
[23:59.97]Yeah, if you need to use the ground.
[24:04.88]If you don't feel the need to prepare before the work day or you're done for the day, you can use the clock to skip the preparation phases at the beginning and end of each day.
[24:11.94]Okay.
[24:21.45]You'll use the faucet mainly to fill pots.
[24:23.33]Most recipes assume that you'll use cold water, so stay away from the red handle unless you're told to use it.
[24:30.37]The oven is for baking.
[24:31.37]Be sure to use baking trays.
[24:32.81]You can find them to the right.
[24:34.07]Remember, you can bake multiple different dishes at the same time.
[24:38.33]Oh my god, the upper switch turns the oven on and off.
[24:40.73]The lower controls the heat.
[24:42.80]Baking times correspond to the first setting, so be careful not to burn your dish.
[24:47.64]Okay.
[24:49.14]I feel like somebody's taking me a tour of a spaceship.
[24:51.36]And they're telling me, like, you know, like, Hey, come and see the cockpit, son.
[24:55.86]And it looks like a fucking Hal from 2001 A Space Odyssey.
[24:59.99]That's what it feels like.
[25:03.17]These are deep fryers.
[25:04.05]They're empty.
[25:04.53]You need to push the left button to fill them with oil.
[25:06.95]The right button drains the tank.
[25:10.15]Oh, and don't forget to use fryer baskets unless you want third degree burns.
[25:13.08]I don't think I want that.
[25:15.04]Well, this one's pretty obvious.
[25:15.94]The grill is for grilling.
[25:16.84]Just don't forget to flip whatever you're cooking.
[25:18.60]Most recipes require that.
[25:23.40]Go to the next marker.
[25:24.78]Darts?
[25:25.68]This is the dart board.
[25:28.08]The food processor.
[25:29.06]Throw the ingredients inside and push the button.
[25:30.92]Presto.
[25:31.34]You've got yourself a liquid blend.
[25:32.97]You can always taste it if you forget what's inside.
[25:37.11]And it's a microwave!
[25:38.71]I don't know what this thing is doing in a respectable kitchen, best you forget it's here.
[25:44.55]And this, this shows why this place nearly closed down.
[25:47.07]The last cook didn't even bother to bring darts, he threw knives instead.
[25:50.23]Pathetic.
[25:52.85]Go to the next marker.
[25:57.73]You can use any of the screens in the kitchen to view your current orders.
[26:00.23]Time left and recipe details, they're really useful.
[26:05.91]Okay, any screen will show that stuff.
[26:07.87]What's this?
[26:09.67]This is your desk.
[26:10.49]The radio looks old, but don't be fooled.
[26:12.55]You can set it to play your own MP3s and even interact internet radio stations.
[26:17.80]The laptop won't cook for you, but it will help you run this place.
[26:20.26]I'm sure the manager will explain everything in detail.
[26:24.93]The phone will come in handy when something breaks down.
[26:26.99]Just pick up and walk up to whatever needs maintenance.
[26:30.03]Pick it up so if it breaks, okay.
[26:32.00]Choose the service company wisely.
[26:33.30]Fast and cheap might be a warning sign.
[26:35.28]Stuff might break before they even leave.
[26:40.52]Holy shit, this is... I'm getting gaver... gaver over... overwhelmed.
[26:46.19]I'm getting gamer-whelmed.
[26:50.03]And there's the checkout.
[26:50.75]Put your dish on the shelf and choose the tablet which order you're about to serve.
[26:56.04]Just don't mix things up.
[26:57.04]Once it's out, it's out.
[27:04.95]Alright.
[27:06.41]I have no idea what's going on.
[27:07.79]Alright, this was just a tour, but I hope you learned something.
[27:10.37]A true chef needs to know his kitchen inside out.
[27:11.59]Alright, we're gonna take this slow.
[27:27.08]Here we go.
[27:29.32]Tutorials.
[27:30.62]Done.
[27:32.38]Wait a minute.
[27:35.50]Oh, fuck.
[27:36.42]I skipped two tutorials.
[27:38.12]I just, it started here.
[27:41.25]No wonder I didn't know how to do this.
[27:42.79]Hold on.
[27:47.03]Hello, the manager asked me to teach you a thing or two.
[27:48.71]I thought I went to the third tutorial.
[27:55.20]I'll teach you how to buy...
[27:59.85]Alright, this is important.
[28:04.13]I want you to walk up to the wooden racks in the pantry.
[28:06.27]See?
[28:06.53]See those tomatoes?
[28:08.93]Buy a tomato.
[28:10.83]Okay, take that tomato to the countertop and set it aside.
[28:16.72]Time to buy a plate.
[28:17.58]It works the same as with buying products.
[28:19.06]Do you see what I'm talking about?
[28:21.08]How I feel like I'm like 30 feet away from this?
[28:31.74]I feel like, yeah, it's the FOV.
[28:34.86]I think I gotta turn the FOV down.
[28:42.95]Right?
[28:45.19]This feels a little better.
[28:56.56]We'll see how that goes.
[28:58.36]Yeah, okay, this, this, this is context really, because look, ready?
[29:01.37]See how far away I am right now?
[29:06.35]Like... This is not right.
[29:09.79]I am, I'm fucking clearly very far away.
[29:15.53]That's what's causing me all these problems.
[29:17.79]We'll do 75.
[29:18.15]There, yeah, that feels much better.
[29:25.17]Much better.
[29:29.94]I'm not gonna do the low.
[29:30.66]Walk up to the tomatoes with the plate in hand and... Okay.
[29:32.76]Walk up to the tomatoes with the plate in hand.
[29:34.94]And get three.
[29:36.62]Yeah, I actually feel like I'm in the space now.
[29:40.78]Three tomatoes.
[29:44.46]Okay.
[29:45.00]Cool.
[29:46.05]So you have to, like, carry stuff with plates.
[29:53.15]Alright.
[29:54.23]Cutting.
[29:54.93]This is where I fucked up last time because I didn't know what to do.
[30:00.12]Pay attention, I will.
[30:04.94]Easy to learn but hard to master.
[30:06.02]Put in the extra hours to practice once we're done.
[30:11.66]Grab the knife.
[30:12.96]What the fuck is calling me right now?
[30:19.15]I have very clear posted streamer hours, okay?
[30:22.03]Why are you calling me during my streaming hours?
[30:25.83]What did the tutorial just say?
[30:32.71]Okay, grab the knife.
[30:36.71]Alright, so... Now I want you to cut the tomato into at least four pieces.
[30:42.49]Just follow the instructions in the bottom right of the screen.
[30:44.75]Four pieces.
[30:45.31]So like... One.
[30:55.18]Two.
[31:00.55]Three, four, fuck.
[31:06.41]This is hard.
[31:09.21]Can I like get in closer?
[31:10.74]Chefs like lean in and don't... Okay, I know what I'm doing.
[31:18.04]Here we go, new game.
[31:21.85]Most people skip tutorials.
[31:23.03]Don't do it.
[31:23.59]Welcome to Cooking Simulator.
[31:24.69]As you've already noticed, the restaurant you're now employed in does not have the greatest rating.
[31:28.35]Your task is to restore it to its former glory and reach the highest level of prestige.
[31:33.18]The last chef left the kitchen covered in sticky notes.
[31:35.84]Maybe they'll come to use to you.
[31:37.58]Good luck.
[31:38.74]Alright, here we go.
[31:40.18]Do you want to follow tutorial during first day?
[31:42.14]Yes.
[31:45.06]Hi, I'm the manager of this place.
[31:46.14]Since it's your first day, I'll show you the ropes.
[31:47.59]Wait, I didn't... I already did it.
[31:49.13]Did I need to be told twice?
[31:50.47]I would get fired.
[31:52.98]In case you get lost.
[31:56.34]Key binding hints are always displayed in the bottom right corner, yeah?
[32:02.30]During this tutorial, you can view your tasks in the bottom left corner of the screen, yeah?
[32:07.54]Three, this tutorial will autosave between stages.
[32:09.78]If you get lost or stuck, you can always go back.
[32:11.40]Why didn't I just do this first?
[32:12.32]Alright, if you have to hold my hand the whole way through, left this place in a sorry state.
[32:20.25]Get on the phone, we need to call some professionals.
[32:24.53]Oh, no, he turned the stove into aluminum foil.
[32:27.69]This looks like aluminum foil.
[32:29.11]This is horrible.
[32:29.89]What do you mean he left in a bad state?
[32:33.24]Did he have a fucking sledgehammer with him?
[32:34.98]Was he- he had a baseball bat and was swinging it around?
[32:37.08]Alright, so we get a call.
[32:38.80]We need to get- we need to get that gas cooker running as soon as possible.
[32:45.65]So we have to go over here and say, get the gas cooker.
[32:49.35]It'll take ages to repair that thing.
[32:50.81]We better hire someone that's fast while hovering over the cooker press to select a company.
[32:55.79]Nice Corp.
[32:57.99]Bakerson.
[32:58.99]Handyman at your service.
[33:01.49]Home repair, fast and smooth.
[33:03.91]Fast service.
[33:07.51]I would never use a service that was called fast service.
[33:11.89]To me, this is like a weird knockoff website of like this place.
[33:18.12]They even got like a similar logo.
[33:20.12]I'm gonna go with Nice Corp.
[33:27.01]Okay.
[33:27.51]So that takes... That's the time.
[33:30.51]So we gotta repair everything.
[33:32.31]How much money do I have?
[33:34.99]We'll have Nice Corp do everything.
[33:36.83]Gotta get a good reputation with one company.
[33:42.31]What else is destroyed?
[33:46.16]Wait, do I have to do both of these?
[33:47.30]Does this count as one?
[33:50.52]Lower oven, left fryer.
[33:51.90]I didn't do this one.
[33:56.00]Lower oven.
[33:57.64]Okay.
[33:59.01]Put the phone away, we won't be needing it anytime soon.
[34:01.25]So then you just have to wait till they're all fixed?
[34:02.93]Okay, no time to take a breather.
[34:08.85]This place is empty and we're gonna do something about it.
[34:13.72]Get some utensils.
[34:14.50]We gotta fill the restaurant.
[34:18.91]Okay, select utensils.
[34:19.99]I don't have any utensils at all.
[34:22.39]We need to get a blender.
[34:25.17]I'm running out of money.
[34:26.57]Put the blender away.
[34:27.23]You can carry only one thing at a time.
[34:33.09]I mean, very clearly, the button says throw.
[34:39.68]I can't.
[34:40.40]No.
[34:41.48]No, this is the first mission.
[34:43.08]Put the blender away.
[34:44.64]Put the blender away.
[34:46.38]I'm not going to throw it.
[34:49.85]Don't throw anything.
[34:52.63]Hover over it and press E to pick up the box.
[34:55.51]Put it down on the countertop.
[34:58.41]Everything.
[34:58.73]You can throw everything.
[35:00.19]I'm not going to do that right now.
[35:03.64]Guys, this is going to be like a nice long stream.
[35:06.02]You want me to automatically start spawning easy pizza?
[35:09.14]I don't think you want that.
[35:10.08]I don't want that.
[35:14.04]Okay, we need to buy cooking equipment.
[35:16.26]We need a bake tray.
[35:18.52]We need all this stuff.
[35:22.15]Use the shop to buy a knife.
[35:25.55]Oh, you gotta individually put everything down.
[35:31.82]You have a power meter.
[35:38.74]Holy shit.
[35:39.52]Alright, no more throwing.
[35:44.95]I need to put the knife in the knife tray.
[35:51.57]There.
[35:53.19]I'm doing this.
[35:54.01]I'm gonna play nice.
[35:54.98]Pan.
[35:55.46]Where does the pan go?
[35:57.64]Underneath here, right?
[36:04.68]Fuck.
[36:07.12]Just put it down.
[36:07.86]Put it down.
[36:09.20]Pan.
[36:11.86]Big pot.
[36:13.90]Big pot goes under here.
[36:20.27]Barely fits under there.
[36:22.11]Cutting board.
[36:23.09]Wait, how many do I need?
[36:23.75]Two big pots?
[36:33.78]Okay.
[36:37.55]Baking tray.
[36:39.77]Let's get that.
[36:40.29]I need to remember where this shit is.
[36:42.11]I'm going to put it in places that I know where it's going to be.
[36:53.36]Alright, last one.
[36:54.16]A spatula.
[36:57.54]I need to remember where this is going to be.
[36:58.50]I'm going to put it over here.
[37:04.28]Yeah, hang it right there.
[37:05.14]This too.
[37:09.15]Can I put it up here?

[38:55.88]We need salt.
[38:59.03]Alright, I gotta put this somewhere.
[39:01.63]Somewhere where I know it's gonna be.
[39:02.75]Somewhere I always know it's gonna be.
[39:03.93]Right here.
[39:08.31]We're not open yet.
[39:09.19]There's going to be much time for shopping.

[41:14.29]No, that's too high.
[41:15.45]I want it in here.
[41:27.17]Oh right, it's made out of glass.
[41:30.03]Wait, can I use this?
[41:38.45]How do I actually use this?
[41:40.47]There we go, move vertically.
[41:41.64]How do I rotate it?
[41:54.32]They didn't teach me how to use this yet.
[42:00.63]Where's the trash?
[42:05.07]Can I scoop this all up?
[42:06.05]I have to do it one by one.
[42:13.00]No, there has to be something.
[42:17.83]Look, people break shit all the time in a restaurant.
[42:20.07]If you guys ever worked in a kitchen like I have, you understand how many bottles broke a day?
[42:24.93]You don't understand how much food was just like dropped on the ground and like bottles shattered and broken and wine bottles and stuff?
[42:30.07]Happens like every 10 seconds.
[42:47.08]Okay.
[42:49.42]I need... Wait, I don't have any oil now.

[43:23.86]Wha- I don't understand!
[43:24.78]I put it- I did- Open the refri- Alright, let's go.
[43:33.30]Each product costs money, so we need one- You don't have to worry about supplies, but still you need- Okay, one trout.
[43:38.64]Got one.
[43:45.74]Okay, black pepper.
[43:47.56]Five grams.
[43:48.78]Black pepper.
[43:49.30]Where's the pepper?
[43:49.80]That's salt.
[43:50.20]Where's the pepper?
[43:50.72]Black pepper.
[43:51.16]B!
[43:57.84]Still.
[43:58.70]D. Time.
[44:04.12]T. Okay, here we go.
[44:08.61]Five grams each.
[44:10.25]Spin this around a little bit.
[44:14.13]Rotate it like this.
[44:17.55]I want to rotate it around.
[44:18.91]I want it sideways.
[44:25.34]I want it sideways.
[44:26.58]Whatever.
[44:28.10]Five grams.
[44:28.72]Okay.
[44:29.52]Here we go.
[44:36.67]Got it.
[44:40.03]Dried dill.
[44:40.55]Pretty good evening seasoning.
[44:58.31]Five.
[44:58.63]Okay.
[45:00.01]What am I... Dill?
[45:01.85]This still needs dill?
[45:03.86]How much is on there?
[45:06.56]That's okay.
[45:07.64]I missed.
[45:10.14]Okay.
[45:11.24]Baking tray.
[45:12.14]Under here.
[45:18.51]Oven.
[45:31.69]Turn on the oven.
[45:32.37]What's the degrees?
[45:34.43]We need a lemon.
[45:41.54]How long does it take?
[45:42.96]Do I have a timer?
[45:45.16]Four pieces.
[45:58.33]Damn it!
[45:59.31]Come on!
[46:03.44]That's fine.
[46:07.53]Hey, put this down.
[46:08.89]What do I do with the lemons?
[46:11.43]Is this done?
[46:15.21]What do I do with the lemons?
[46:22.03]Just staring.
[46:23.33]Imagine you go into a restaurant in the back and the chef could be doing anything else.
[46:28.03]And he's just fucking staring, just waiting.
[46:33.34]How long does it take?
[46:35.26]How do I know when it's done?
[46:38.60]It's not burnt.
[46:39.20]The fridge is still open.
[46:42.34]It's wasting it.
[46:42.86]Alright.
[46:43.18]Don't blow up the propane tank.
[46:57.40]That was very violent mopping.
[46:59.22]Is it done?
[46:59.62]I need to check.
[47:02.22]Is it done?
[47:03.85]It's done, it's done, it's done.
[47:06.10]My hands!
[47:07.22]Ow!
[47:08.50]Alright.
[47:09.06]Is it done?
[47:09.48]No, it's not done.
[47:13.72]Ow!
[47:15.08]Ow!
[47:16.66]Oh, fuck!
[47:18.28]I can't feel my hands anymore.
[47:21.34]Okay, it's done.
[47:30.45]I need a plate.
[47:38.93]Okay, transfer the product.
[47:42.93]See, five grams of horseradish.
[47:48.45]My hands are probably so inflamed.
[47:50.29]I probably have huge, huge, like, Mickey Mouse glove hands right now because it's swelling up.
[47:55.74]Alright, five grams?
[48:04.57]Okay.
[48:11.79]Now pick up the lemon quarters and target them and expand.
[48:14.21]Wait.
[48:15.83]Okay, so here we go.
[48:19.25]That looks horrible.
[48:22.77]That's just a joke.
[48:24.45]Just serve it with one lemon.
[48:30.38]Parsley leaves.
[48:32.50]One, two, three.
[48:36.05]Serve it.
[48:37.03]Put it on the counter.
[48:38.91]Wait, can I, like, move it around a little?
[48:43.70]Well, okay.
[48:45.12]Enter the... Like, that looks bad!
[49:14.65]Okay, hold on.
[49:31.35]Looks good.
[49:37.56]Midnight, okay.
[49:47.42]Okay, hide the UI, take the picture.
[49:51.98]Save it.
[49:52.72]Looks fucking pretty good, actually.
[49:55.15]Put it on Grandma's Facebook.
[49:57.57]Ding.
[50:01.57]Taste?
[50:02.93]Almost five stars.
[50:04.57]Pretty good.
[50:09.17]Any complaints?
[50:10.07]It was perfect.
[50:11.65]The lemon quarters were not cut perfectly.
[50:15.86]Yeah, whatever.
[50:16.32]You're gonna come back.
[50:18.98]That's it for today.
[50:19.52]Tomorrow we'll be open for business, so do your best.
[50:21.56]Alright.
[50:25.46]After each day, you'll be presented with a summary of progress the restaurant made.
[50:30.21]Our goal is to reach full 5-star fame rating.
[50:32.49]As you can see, there's still a lot ahead of us.
[50:33.99]Yes, there is.
[50:35.45]Total income, negative $1,400.00.
[50:38.73]How much money do I have?
[50:39.49]Alright, this is where it begins.
[50:45.06]We get to choose a perk.
[50:49.42]There are perks.
[50:49.94]Okay.
[51:04.45]Perks are very powerful, unique abilities.
[51:06.09]Once every few levels, you'll be given an option to choose one.
[51:09.00]This choice can't be postponed or undone, so take your time and pick what you think will be the most useful.
[51:17.30]Can you view perks?
[51:17.98]You're already using your perk browser app.
[51:19.84]Okay, hold on.
[51:20.53]Long reach.
[51:21.37]Long arms.
[51:22.19]Longer reach from picking up and putting down items.
[51:24.55]Have really long fucking arms.
[51:27.37]Fast feet.
[51:28.19]Get at three skill points instead of unlocking a perk.
[51:32.23]Steady hands.
[51:34.37]Hold down shift to freeze items in place while cutting.
[51:37.01]That's what's going on here.
[51:38.71]I want this one.
[51:45.41]Lower score requirements.
[51:46.37]Pass the food critics.
[51:47.75]Learn the temperature of ingredients in a closed oven.
[51:50.93]That's good.
[51:55.25]Time slows down while cutting.
[51:57.86]Once per day, reset the timer of an active order.
[52:03.00]Re-roll order?
[52:04.00]Grants a magic wand that removes all stains and shards.
[52:07.08]I mean, steady hands.
[52:09.32]That's... I have to use that.
[52:14.88]Skill points are used to unlock and upgrade skills.
[52:16.62]With each level, you gain a certain amount of SPs.
[52:19.36]You can spend them... Okay.
[52:21.62]What do I have for points?
[52:22.78]I got three.
[52:25.16]Oh my god.
[52:25.84]What?
[52:32.87]Alright, so... Income, pay 10% more for their orders without affecting the score.
[52:40.22]10% more cooking points.
[52:45.52]Kitchen decorations are cheaper.
[52:46.98]You earn 50 more experience points for dish stars.
[52:51.16]Chain four star dishes to earn more fame.
[52:54.07]Liquids cost less.
[52:55.59]Products cost less.
[52:57.61]I'm...
[53:00.08]Spices are less.
[53:01.26]Guest tip more.
[53:05.76]I think I'm going to go with they pay more money.
[53:10.91]Yeah.
[53:11.31]I want 30% more money.
[53:14.81]Alright.
[53:16.39]The joke's over.
[53:17.03]It's time to fucking actually play.
[53:20.36]This is the real game now.
[53:21.28]Alright.
[53:25.78]Here we go.
[53:27.83]Remember, everything you serve today will affect your reputation.
[53:32.77]Let's do this.
[53:33.25]Let's make the best restaurant in the city.
[53:37.87]By throwing the propane tank into the microwave and turning it on for five minutes.
[53:42.45]The name should tell the story.
[53:43.17]No orders yet, but you can use anything in the kitchen to prepare for the day.
[53:47.37]Make sure to prepare the ingredients you'll be using.
[53:49.33]Getting a head start on some of the dishes is also a good idea.
[53:51.87]As long as you know what you're doing.
[53:54.47]There's fucking rumors in this game.
[53:58.20]I just had a flash of... Okay, hold on.
[54:08.03]I feel bad right now.
[54:09.03]Okay.
[54:09.99]Let's pick what we left off.
[54:10.95]Open the Skill Manager app.
[54:14.19]That's bright.
[54:18.25]If you didn't spend your skill points, you can do so now.
[54:20.50]I did.
[54:24.18]You can choose to save up points and use the app later.
[54:26.64]Okay.
[54:26.86]Okay.
[54:29.21]You can get decorations.
[54:31.39]Reset all of your points, but that's gonna cost you money.
[54:35.59]Makes sense.
[54:38.85]Perk browser.
[54:41.34]You can actually select perks.
[54:43.62]It's like Call of Duty.
[54:46.24]Alright, okay, hold down Shift to freeze items while cutting.
[54:49.94]Alright, let's go.
[54:52.00]Yikes, look at the time!
[54:52.90]We need to open right away, let's get cooking.
[54:56.24]What?
[54:56.98]It's time to... I'm not ready?
[54:58.86]I thought you might still need me today, so I'm here.
[55:00.74]But only for today.
[55:01.50]Don't get too attached.
[55:05.26]Dish salmon.
[55:06.25]Oh, I actually have a timer now.
[55:08.99]Find a big pot.
[55:09.63]We'll need to boil the potatoes.
[55:17.51]Fill it with one cup of water.
[55:20.71]How do I know how much water I'm going to get?
[55:23.71]How do I turn it on?
[55:26.31]How do I turn the faucet on?
[55:27.48]No, is this cold or hot?
[55:30.58]That's hot water.
[55:31.54]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[55:33.10]Cold water, E. How much water?
[55:40.58]I feel like I'm at a gas station.
[55:42.42]Okay, got it.
[55:42.82]20 grams of salt, that's too much salt.
[55:56.55]Ugh!
[55:59.63]Need two potatoes.
[56:09.52]Potatoes.
[56:10.36]Two of them.
[56:10.72]How do I buy two?
[56:11.26]Can I buy more than one?
[56:12.06]Alright.
[56:19.81]Boiled potatoes.
[56:21.53]Cook for 120 seconds.
[56:22.09]Is this the right one?
[56:26.80]Okay, that's the right one.
[56:28.78]120 seconds.
[56:29.16]Count!
[56:30.00]1, 2... Where were we at?
[56:32.26]10?
[56:33.22]Okay, so 10... 120 seconds is 2 minutes.
[56:35.67]So when this gets to 10, twice.
[56:37.53]Okay, go!
[56:47.69]Okay, boil potato.
[56:48.85]Boil... Where's my cutting board?
[56:52.89]Okay, got salmon.
[56:59.48]I just got... I already have one.
[57:01.54]I have one.
[57:02.92]Alright.
[57:03.50]Fish on the cutting board.
[57:04.20]Got it.
[57:06.66]We need salt and black pepper.
[57:09.76]How much do we need?
[57:10.27]Five grams?
[57:16.77]Okay.
[57:17.19]Black pepper.
[57:20.37]Ten?
[57:22.05]Okay.
[57:22.63]Where's the pepper?
[57:24.11]Where's black pepper?
[57:26.05]Where's black pepper?
[57:26.79]Give me it.
[57:33.82]Frying in oil.
[57:38.61]Oh my God.
[57:40.79]Put it back in.
[57:41.89]Put it back in.
[57:42.85]How do I put it back in?
[57:43.47]Okay.
[57:50.77]I need sunflower oil.
[57:53.34]Don't step on the glass.
[57:54.30]Watch over your bare feet.
[57:56.54]How much oil do I need in the pan?
[57:58.56]10 milliliters.
[58:08.81]Tilt the bottle.
[58:13.41]Oh!
[58:17.61]Get the salmon in there.
[58:19.41]That looks fucking... Is there like bugs on it?
[58:22.01]Why are there like ants on this?
[58:24.83]Fry the steak for 60 seconds.
[58:28.82]10?
[58:30.22]Are they done?
[58:31.92]Wait, are these done?
[58:34.74]Oh, I... That's not real time.
[58:38.06]Hold...
[58:39.64]Okay, what do I do with this?
[58:41.30]I get the potatoes straight from the pot into the plate.
[58:44.86]What plate?
[58:46.66]What plate?
[58:48.37]Plate!
[58:48.77]I need plate.
[58:49.83]Basic plate.
[58:51.23]Deep plate.
[58:55.75]Okay.
[58:59.41]Just put this down.
[59:02.35]How about the salmon?
[59:02.89]Salmon doing alright?
[59:06.66]Why is it not cooking?
[59:07.52]Okay, hold on.
[59:08.50]Do I have to cut these?
[59:09.96]Oh, god damn it, it's not on.
[59:11.50]Okay, hold on.
[59:12.60]Spatula!
[59:24.71]When do I flip it?
[59:25.71]Wait, you don't flip... Don't you not flip salmon?
[59:28.89]I know how to cook salmon!
[59:30.37]You don't flip it.
[59:31.84]You cover it!
[59:33.36]Where's the cover?
[59:35.13]Where's the cover for the oven?
[59:36.64]Where's the cover?
[59:37.48]Where are the vampire ladies that are gonna eat me?
[59:47.09]These are gonna get cold.
[59:49.55]How much time do I have?
[59:52.05]Three minutes.
[59:58.28]Can I turn the heat up?
[60:04.26]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on!
[60:05.42]Let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[60:19.57]Wait, now it's... Now I can't.
[60:21.90]I... I have to do it again.
[60:24.22]Flip it again.
[60:24.70]Okay, we're good.
[60:28.54]60 seconds.
[60:28.94]Timer!
[60:39.07]Alright, 50 seconds.
[60:49.56]Is it almost done?
[60:55.22]What do I do in the meantime?
[60:56.04]I've got two minutes.
[60:56.62]I'm fine.
[60:56.92]I think I'm going to have to cut up the potatoes, though.
[60:59.10]Are they still hot?
[61:00.42]Yeah, they are.
[61:00.70]Let me test.
[61:08.51]Give me this.
[61:15.39]I just heard a rumor.
[61:22.49]Alright.
[61:24.18]Come on.
[61:24.62]How much time?
[61:26.30]I still got a little bit of time.
[61:32.60]Perfectly calculated.
[61:41.33]Put it down.
[61:42.51]Just put the salmon down.
[61:45.40]That's not cooked on the bottom!
[61:48.92]Stop it!
[61:49.54]Olivia!
[61:56.27]Th- Pick up the plate with the salmon s- Put the plate on the serving shell.
[62:04.67]This is not ready to serve!
[62:08.01]You just want two fucking baked potatoes?
[62:10.84]This is not even food!
[62:13.10]What?
[62:17.57]This looks like a dessert.
[62:18.63]This looks like a cake.
[62:19.45]No, that's a cake.
[62:41.72]Imagine being served salmon like this, sitting up on its side.
[62:46.24]You'd be like, the chef is fucking drunk.
[62:59.43]Not bad, actually.
[63:04.45]I got a seven cent tip.
[63:06.75]What were the complaints?
[63:09.44]Heating mistakes.
[63:11.45]Too much oil on the steak.
[63:14.43]Yeah.
[63:14.91]Well, he still ate it.
[63:18.79]No time for slacking off.
[63:19.59]Next order's here.
[63:20.17]Tomato soup.
[63:21.07]What do we have to do?
[63:24.16]We need a big pot.
[63:25.08]Find one.
[63:25.42]Make sure it's empty.
[63:27.16]Oh, fuck.
[63:27.64]This is still boiling.
[63:32.86]I'm trying to get it in the sink.
[63:41.33]I'm gonna give myself a headache.
[63:42.25]Imagine you just throw that into the ground.
[63:46.89]How do I open this?
[63:52.29]Open the chicken broth.
[63:54.25]Do we need 700 milliliters?
[63:55.39]Alright, get it in there.
[63:59.75]Stop pouring it!
[64:04.99]Alright, season the broth.
[64:07.05]I need Cayenne pepper to the pot.
[64:13.61]12 grams.
[64:14.59]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[64:16.73]And we need some Cayenne pepper.
[64:22.29]Where's Cayenne?
[64:23.59]Horseradish.
[64:24.85]Cayenne?
[64:26.11]Thyme.
[64:27.47]I need Cayenne.
[64:28.29]Now.

[64:32.92]6 grams.
[64:35.98]Good.
[64:37.28]Okay.
[64:37.68]I need tomatoes.
[64:41.00]That's fucking salt.
[64:42.34]God damn it.
[64:42.76]Where is it?
[64:51.33]Okay, done.
[64:53.45]Take the pot into the pantry and buy eight- put eight tomatoes in here.
[65:04.00]Eight tomatoes.
[65:05.12]We need an onion.
[65:05.98]What?
[65:06.22]This is not how you make tomato soup!
[65:15.25]Why do I hear gas?
[65:22.25]Oh!
[65:29.17]Okay.
[65:30.29]Boil the soup.
[65:31.69]How much time do I got?
[65:33.59]Five minutes.
[65:34.05]I got plenty of time.
[65:35.83]What was in here?
[65:36.87]What?
[65:47.21]I guess you can throw that away.
[65:49.19]Hold on.
[65:49.59]This is dirty.
[65:53.26]I need to throw it away.
[66:01.32]Fucking dog shit restaurant.
[66:03.34]This is so fu- How do I clean the top?
[66:05.94]How do I clean in there?
[66:07.48]Is it boiling yet?
[66:18.78]Can I buy a sponge?
[66:24.65]Alright, this is... They're almost done.
[66:28.65]Turn off the heat and let... And blend the contents.
[66:32.57]What?
[66:32.75]Okay, turn it on.
[66:55.65]I'm trying to drop.
[66:57.65]Is it a mouse scroll?
[66:59.45]Oh my god!
[67:15.65]Alright, done.
[67:19.87]Okay, what do I need now?
[67:21.13]Sour cream?
[67:23.49]Pour sour cream.
[67:24.33]Where's sour cream?
[67:26.18]I already have it.
[67:26.64]It's already over here.
[67:33.68]Okay, this is not... You have to easily tilt.

[68:12.42]Nobody doesn't use- you la- it was a ladle!
[68:19.60]This is not what I'm supposed to do, right?
[68:26.34]That was the whole pot.
[68:29.16]This is a huge serving.
[68:30.87]Imagine being served a full pot of tomato soup.
[69:04.08]That's a full five right there.
[69:10.44]Any complaints?
[69:12.32]Technique was perfect.
[69:14.26]Wrong amount of product.

[72:29.25]Okay, tell my son.
[72:37.64]And then we need dried horseradish.
[72:41.04]And then... So get it on a plate.
[72:45.94]Garnish with parsley leaves.
[72:47.70]Six grams.
[72:55.60]I need a plate.
[72:59.21]Basic plate.
[73:04.85]Is it done?
[73:05.17]I'm burning my fucking hands.

[74:18.32]I didn't have any help on that one.
[74:19.38]Got them all perfect.
[74:22.68]You got a hold of basics pretty quickly, so what's the master plan, you might ask?
[74:25.16]Well, I want this place to go from snow stars to five stars.
[74:30.88]Not in the red today.
[74:34.02]Each dish you serve affects our fame score.
[74:35.68]Do well and the score goes up.
[74:36.78]Mess up and we're going down.
[74:38.66]I made 108 cents.
[74:39.50]We need to attract a food critic.
[74:42.84]To do that, we have to meet a fame score quota at the end of the day.
[74:48.40]I did it.
[74:50.66]I got to 30.
[74:51.04]I got 34.
[74:51.44]There's a food critic coming in at the end of today.
[74:59.58]Already?
[74:59.96]We just opened.
[75:03.14]Going over the quota to have some breathing space, just in case.
[75:05.72]Yeah, I did.
[75:08.26]A food critic wants to try your cooking tomorrow.
[75:10.08]Impress him and we're guaranteed a fame star.
[75:13.94]Once the critic is here, focus on his order.
[75:15.57]Score at least four stars to pass his exam.
[75:19.27]Tomorrow we're getting inspected.
[75:20.51]It's a great chance to raise our fame.
[75:22.33]Be ready.
[75:22.77]Well, I need to clean the kitchen.
[75:29.39]Level up.
[75:30.33]Skill point.

[75:35.15]Yeah.
[75:36.67]I want 50% more money.
[75:40.72]I think we should expand our menu.
[75:42.26]Look at the dishes below and pick your favorite.
[75:45.56]Pork chops with baked potatoes or simple Ukrainian borscht.
[75:52.12]This takes nine minutes.
[75:53.06]This takes seven.
[75:55.54]Borscht?

[98:17.12]Can I even do that?
[98:33.07]They do that at hipster restaurants.
[98:34.81]That's true.
[98:42.86]Let's see if this works.
[98:46.83]Why are people taking the plates home?
[98:48.31]Yeah, that's weird.

[100:15.92]It just deleted my fucking pan.
[100:19.10]Alright.
[100:20.08]I'm upset about that.
[100:22.37]I'm going to get this shit ready now so I don't have to not have enough money to buy.
[100:26.91]Alright, here we go.

[105:03.67]It doesn't say to blend.
[105:05.99]I mean, it doesn't say blend.
[105:12.73]So just boil it for 120 seconds, and then deep, uh, deep plate.

[106:33.31]They're getting a little, uh, they're getting a little crunchy.
[106:39.07]Okay, that's it.

[118:11.06]Okay, get in there.
[118:12.46]Three, four, five.
[118:15.53]Salt, pepper.
[118:16.19]And then we need to oil the pan.
[118:18.97]Sunflower oil, salmon filet.

[118:33.31]Whatever.
[118:35.39]Alright, hold on.
[118:36.37]Let's get the other thing going.
[118:37.35]We need, uh, boiled potatoes.
[118:40.24]Don't get rid of that.
[118:40.90]There's still soup in there.
[118:46.38]How did that not go in the fucking sink?
[118:48.12]Fuck you, sink.
[118:49.48]Alright, boiled potatoes.

[119:12.18]Alright.
[119:12.48]Potatoes.
[119:13.00]How many potatoes?
[119:13.54]2.
[119:13.56]That's a lemon.
[119:14.06]That's not a potato.
[119:14.86]Boil.
[119:15.08]Here we go.
[119:36.85]One.
[119:37.83]Two.
[119:38.87]Three.
[119:40.01]Four.

[120:06.35]Okay.
[120:07.75]Looking good.
[120:09.97]Flip it with my spatula.
[120:11.43]I hung it up, right?
[120:12.41]I did.
[120:12.89]Good.
[120:13.77]Smart boy.
[120:14.21]I'm gonna go for a flip.
[120:18.11]Don't!
[120:18.79]Every time I fuck this up.
[120:20.55]I'm not gonna fuck it up.
[120:21.39]I do it every single time.
[120:23.37]Not this time, though.
[120:25.85]This is the time where I actually get it back in the pan.
[120:33.60]Got it.
[120:38.82]He got it.
[120:42.42]Do it again.
[120:43.88]Alright, need a plate.
[120:52.03]Here we go.
[120:55.83]Serve hot.
[120:56.37]That's it.
[120:56.71]Just get a plate.
[120:57.79]Do I have one?
[120:58.34]There's a broken one over there.
[121:02.38]Basic plate.
[121:05.74]Okay, I'm almost ready.
[121:12.59]potatoes come out.
[121:13.91]It's going to be like 120 seconds.
[121:15.81]Alright, here we go.
[121:16.27]Almost done.
[121:16.59]This is going to be perfect.
[121:32.91]It's going to be right on time.
[121:38.51]Okay.
[121:39.85]One.
[121:40.85]Two.
[121:41.89]Three.
[121:43.27]Take it out!
[121:44.45]Don't drop it!
[121:52.42]Oh no.
[121:53.76]Is it over the- Come on, how do you do this?
[122:02.59]Alright, give me the plate.
[122:03.85]Stop ringing.
[122:04.71]I wish it didn't ring this much.
[122:19.78]Done.
[122:24.94]What did I do wrong?
[122:28.66]Potatoes with too much salt.
[122:30.93]Why does the recipe say 20 grams if it's too much?
[122:36.21]Okay, I'm done.
[122:43.25]So.
[122:45.65]Did I do at least four stars?
[122:57.53]Okay, let's clean up.
[122:58.85]I got... Okay, this is perfect.
[123:00.59]This is amazing.
[123:01.35]I got plenty of time.
[123:02.39]I gotta clean the stove.
[123:03.95]Clean this shit up.
[123:06.59]Into the sink.
[123:09.00]No, dump it in the sink.
[123:18.00]Alright.
[123:18.72]I'm not gonna do that anymore.
[123:22.45]Just get it in the sink.
[123:27.79]Okay, there we go.
[123:28.57]Finally.
[123:28.93]I just put it into the oven.
[123:34.19]Come on.
[123:35.31]Get out of the fucking way.
[123:37.14]Why?
[123:37.52]Why is it playing like the Godfather music?
[123:42.82]Is somebody gonna come here and whack me?
[123:56.59]Can I not clean this?
[124:03.67]I don't think I can clean in here.
[124:04.61]Alright, pots are ready.
[124:09.09]Hang the spatula up.
[124:14.06]Sour cream is not very much left in there.
[124:16.74]There is a little bit.
[124:20.00]Okay, let's get the spices back to normal.
[124:24.46]Turn off the heat.
[124:25.24]That would be nice.
[124:26.98]Blend.
[124:27.40]Alright, that's fine.
[124:29.70]Look at how fucking dirty it is in here.
[124:31.05]Alright, give me the
[124:41.00]What?
[124:41.88]I can't clean that?
[124:42.53]Do I need to buy a new stove?
[124:53.91]How much time do I got?
[124:54.69]A couple minutes.
[124:56.23]Let's get the cutting board in a good spot.
[124:59.37]Get the knife on over here.
[125:02.63]Salt and pepper.
[125:04.31]Put them together.
[125:04.87]The other spices can just hang out over here.
[125:10.24]Everything that needs salt always needs pepper, so I'm just going to keep them right next to each other.
[125:16.26]The rest of these can just hang out over here.
[125:18.32]Alright, I'm going to get a new recipe.
[125:22.50]I'm going to use it eventually, so just keep it over here.
[125:27.01]Here's the reverse jazz... Don't break.
[125:30.81]The reverse jazz song.
[125:34.33]I can clean that.
[125:35.63]I can't clean this.
[125:36.87]None of this is even dirty.
[125:40.87]Okay, I'm good.
[125:47.51]Anything else that I need to do?
[125:48.36]Besides mop?
[125:52.98]I'll ride this.
[125:58.64]Yeah, the broken plate on the ground.
[126:05.48]There's no broom or something.
[126:06.60]I can definitely sweep, right?
[126:09.19]You have to be able to sweep.
[126:17.11]Yeah, I'll get a stove cleaning company.
[126:26.00]Um... Here, I got a better idea.
[126:41.41]No, I'm not going to throw it in the... I'm just doing this so I don't have to run around...
[126:48.39]Don't waste.
[126:51.46]What are you... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[126:53.28]You want me to use already old cooked ingredients for tomorrow?
[126:57.00]Is that gonna work?
[127:12.97]That's how stock is made.
[127:17.59]I don't think that people are going to want to eat like an old cooked tomato.
[127:20.34]Alright.
[127:23.04]Heatproof gloves.
[127:24.28]Long reach.
[127:27.22]Thermal vision.
[127:32.95]Connections.
[127:34.27]Time slows when cutting ingredients.
[127:35.63]I think I'm going to do long arms or heatproof gloves.
[127:43.07]Yeah.
[127:43.75]Alright, so I can just pick shit up and move it around.
[127:47.41]Or long hands.
[127:57.18]Hmm.
[127:58.26]Let's do long arms.
[128:00.82]So I get more money.
[128:01.40]Now this is important.
[128:02.18]Hold on.
[128:03.76]Is there a way I can increase the time?
[128:06.68]Experience points.
[128:08.38]More fame.
[128:10.16]Products cost less.
[128:12.75]I mean, this is important.
[128:17.61]Liquids stuff costs less.
[128:20.99]I'm doing it twice.
[128:35.56]Demonstrate your skills.
[128:36.84]Alright, I cleaned up a little bit, so I should be good to go.
[128:38.74]I have to repair a company.
[128:39.89]Quickly.
[128:41.55]Quickly.
[128:44.14]Hurry up.
[128:48.67]13 seconds.
[128:48.95]Quickly, come on, come on, come on.
[128:51.15]How long's it gonna take?
[128:52.83]15 seconds?
[128:53.91]This is expensive!
[128:54.65]Okay, fine.
[128:56.09]We're good.
[129:02.33]Alright, I've got two minutes until I'm ready to go.
[129:04.45]I'm getting my ingredients out.
[129:07.45]I'm getting a couple of chicken broths.
[129:11.61]Can I buy a, uh, recipe?
[129:18.63]Not owned, okay.
[129:20.23]Pork chops with baked potatoes?
[129:23.27]Could do that.
[129:34.25]Do more soups?
[129:35.43]I don't think I can do soups.
[129:39.64]Duck broth.
[129:41.48]Nah, I'm not famous enough for duck broth.
[129:46.04]I can do pork chop and baked potatoes.
[129:52.86]Yeah, pork chops.
[129:56.60]I can't buy soups.
[130:02.10]Perks.
[130:02.60]Skills.
[130:03.58]Everything's good to go.
[130:04.24]Alright.
[130:06.52]So, I'm going to pre-make the soup.
[130:09.08]I need to pre-make soup, so let's get it out.
[130:11.08]Let's get the ingredients out.
[130:13.18]Just pre-make everything and then put it in the microwave.
[130:14.83]Alright, here's the soup.
[130:16.29]I already got it right here.
[130:16.89]What do I need?
[130:20.15]No, this is all... I need one more beet, right?
[130:26.89]One more beet?
[130:29.43]No, that's not gonna work.
[130:34.03]Is this gonna work?
[130:39.35]And then an onion, right?
[130:42.33]This is not gonna work, guys.
[130:45.73]No, I'm throwing this shit away.
[130:46.97]Which one is the one that I just bought?
[130:52.20]I'm not gonna serve customers old food.
[130:54.18]That's not how it works.
[130:58.24]This is the new one.
[131:01.96]Gordon Ramsay would come in this restaurant and start fucking trashing the place.
[131:11.24]Five.
[131:12.84]And then I need an onion.
[131:14.04]No, what is it?
[131:14.88]Carrot.
[131:16.66]And then parsley, right?
[131:22.32]Parsley, and then... What is it?
[131:26.43]One onion, right?
[131:31.36]And then it's chicken broth or is it water?
[131:35.57]Let's get like two or three chicken broths out here.
[131:47.41]And sour cream.
[131:50.74]Well, not yet.
[131:51.22]Not yet.
[131:51.54]Don't overbuy everything.
[131:52.40]Alright, I got my spices.
[131:54.30]I got my pre-made soup.
[131:55.38]Wait, what's the other one?
[131:55.98]The other one's tomato, right?
[131:56.84]Get over here.
[131:58.62]How many tomatoes is it?
[132:01.85]It's one, two, eight tomatoes.
[132:07.72]Eight, and then it's one onion, right?
[132:12.80]Eight and an onion, I think.
[132:17.58]Okay, that's good to go.
[132:18.32]Now that's also chicken broth, right?
[132:26.87]Here we go.
[132:27.45]This is why you prep.
[132:31.10]New order.
[132:32.36]Fish.
[132:36.58]I know this one by heart, almost.
[132:39.73]Where's my tray?
[132:41.03]Where's my tray?
[132:45.11]Where's the fucking tray?
[132:46.91]Come on, man.
[132:48.19]Really?
[132:51.53]I prepped and everything, and the tray's just not here anymore.
[132:54.96]I don't own a tray anymore.
[132:57.74]Are you kidding me?
[133:03.72]A waste of fucking time already.
[133:07.88]Okay, it's pepper, thyme, dill.
[133:15.79]Two, three, four, five.
[133:26.70]Get it!
[133:29.32]Pepper is right next to it right here.
[133:32.75]And then bake 90 seconds.
[133:41.28]Get it in there.
[133:41.76]90 seconds.
[133:43.80]And then horse- Yep.
[133:44.60]Don't run like you usually do!
[133:55.33]What the fuck are you doing?
[133:56.71]Why- Get it in the oven! 91.
[134:00.34]Two.
[134:01.34]Three.
[134:02.38]Four.

[134:04.37]Six.
[134:05.43]Seven.
[134:06.45]Eight.
[134:07.51]Nine.
[134:08.45]Ten.
[134:10.67]I just did way too much time.
[134:11.55]Okay.
[134:17.67]Now we got the lemon quarter.
[134:23.86]Let's get it ready.
[134:29.31]Freeze time.
[134:30.33]Excellent.
[134:31.33]Right down the middle.
[134:33.30]Right down the center.
[134:34.28]Perfect.
[134:34.96]Not perfect, but it's okay.
[134:35.82]Could be worse.
[134:37.02]Plate.
[134:37.80]Do I already have a plate?
[134:39.14]No, I do not, Jeremy.
[134:40.06]Focus.
[134:40.44]God damn it.
[134:42.41]You're gonna lose everything.
[134:43.31]You're gonna lose everything.
[134:48.05]Alright, when that shit comes out, we got horseradish five.
[134:52.35]Get it all on the plate.
[134:53.58]Parsley.
[135:02.80]Come on.

[136:13.16]Enjoy.
[136:13.34]Bon appetit.
[136:13.82]You dick.
[136:15.96]Imagine being that mad.
[136:24.91]There you go, you dick.
[136:29.21]Alright, I'm prepped.
[136:31.89]New order.
[136:32.85]The...
[136:34.89]Bostromish, whatever this is called.
[136:36.81]Alright, everything's ready.
[136:38.03]Chicken broth.
[136:39.07]Salt.
[136:39.55]Chicken broth, salt.
[136:40.41]Pepper.
[136:42.09]Everything's already in there.
[136:42.81]Chicken broth, salt, pepper.
[136:43.55]Okay.
[137:02.20]Fucking close enough.
[137:06.95]Salt and pepper.
[137:08.67]20 of each.
[137:19.62]20.
[137:22.08]Did that actually get in there?
[137:23.13]Am I crazy or did that say 10?
[137:35.50]Did that not all go in?
[137:51.27]Did it not all go in?
[137:53.09]That was fucking weird.
[137:55.00]It said 12.
[137:55.60]Alright, where's my pepper?
[137:59.24]That's why I fucking prepped.
[138:00.30]Give me my pepper.
[138:01.06]God damn it.
[138:01.62]20.
[138:02.48]Okay.
[138:02.80]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
[138:04.12]I'm understanding what's happening here.
[138:07.08]I have salted.
[138:08.04]I put like 20 grams of salt on one beet.
[138:10.36]Oh my fucking god.
[138:11.34]Whatever.
[138:11.64]Okay.
[138:11.88]Boil.
[138:12.14]Just boil.
[138:12.58]Go.
[138:12.70]I don't have time for this.
[138:34.94]120 seconds.
[138:36.98]Put it on... 110.
[138:39.94]Alright, here we go.
[138:43.32]Now we just fucking hang out and who cares.
[138:44.76]I didn't mix it into the broth somehow.
[138:50.00]Don't Ster this up.
[138:51.48]I want to pick it up by the sides and just like shake it around.
[138:53.60]I'm gonna blow this place up.
[139:10.68]Put propane in the oven.
[139:12.10]I'm not doing that yet.
[139:15.67]Give me another order so I can start prepping.
[139:30.60]Add 40 seconds to the timer.
[139:31.96]I want to just start breaking stuff.
[139:33.40]No.
[139:37.30]The onions are overcooked.
[139:39.70]Not yet.
[139:39.94]Not yet.
[139:42.06]They will be, very soon.
[139:43.12]Almost done?
[139:58.91]Almost done, almost done, almost done, almost done, almost done, almost done, almost done, one, two, three, four, five.
[140:06.29]Why are the onions so overcooked?
[140:10.01]You put everything in the pot and you boil it at the same time.
[140:11.78]I don't understand.
[140:13.48]Take the onion out.
[140:14.40]Alright.
[140:17.08]Off.
[140:18.36]Out.
[140:19.30]Into a bowl.
[140:22.24]And then sayonara.
[140:32.21]Just pick up the onion with your hand.
[140:45.71]Am I ever gonna buy a ladle for this shit?
[140:51.18]Hold her up!
[140:52.62]Italian borscht.
[140:56.24]Pretty good.
[141:00.99]Not enough pepper.
[141:01.67]Yeah, I understand what's happening now.
[141:05.15]Alright, here comes the food critic.
[141:05.97]Save the fucking game.
[141:15.10]Here we go.
[141:16.19]Oh no, I've never made this before.
[141:17.95]I don't know how to do this.
[141:19.55]Of course you order the new thing I don't know how to make.
[141:21.51]Pork chops.
[141:23.43]Um, okay, pork chops.
[141:25.15]How many do I need?
[141:25.65]Two?
[141:27.65]Just one.
[141:30.90]Alright, and then... Salt the pork chop with black pepper and salt, and then thyme.
[141:37.62]So, thyme.
[141:38.64]Six grams.
[141:39.14]One, two, three, four, five, six...
[141:47.80]And then salt and pepper, four.
[141:54.57]Evenly season it.
[141:56.59]One, two, three, four.
[142:00.27]Nice.
[142:09.70]For Minecraft food.
[142:12.72]Somebody says... Okay, pan.
[142:15.40]Don't forget about the food... What do you mean time's running out?
[142:17.57]What the fuck are you talking about?
[142:19.13]Sunflower oil pork chops.
[142:20.75]Okay, 30 milliliters of sunflower oil.
[142:22.83]Sunflower oil.
[142:23.67]30 milliliters of sunflower oil.
[142:32.82]What do you mean mixture?
[142:35.16]Is there oil already in here?
[142:36.08]There's already...
[142:40.59]There's like dirty fish oil in here.
[142:43.99]Hope you're not allergic.
[142:46.82]Alright, so we got fry for 90 seconds each side.
[142:49.44]Okay, fry for, what else do we need to do?
[142:53.32]And then bake potatoes.
[142:55.74]And then you bake.
[142:57.06]Okay, cut potato into chunks.
[143:00.32]Cut potato, 300 grams of potatoes into chunks.
[143:11.26]I need to say, pause it.
[143:13.24]I just took my hand, picked it up with my fucking hand, and forcibly tried to stick it to the table.
[143:20.68]Like... Like I was making a... Oh my god.
[143:29.51]Alright, I need to focus.
[143:31.51]300 grams of potatoes.
[143:32.65]How many potatoes is that?
[143:33.47]I do need a plate eventually here, so 300 grams of potatoes.
[143:41.07]It's two potatoes.
[143:46.03]Transfer them over to here.
[143:48.69]So I gotta cut these... into chunks of 50 grams.
[143:55.51]So I need... six chunks.
[144:03.22]So cut them into threes?
[144:28.93]Oh.
[144:34.19]Chuck's at 50.
[144:35.17]Yeah, that's 6.
[144:38.31]I didn't do anything wrong.
[144:40.79]Baking tray.
[144:41.43]Bake for 80 seconds.
[144:42.23]Where's the baking tray?
[144:43.93]It's already in there.
[144:52.48]Okay, turn the oven on.
[144:57.59]80 seconds.
[144:58.07]Here we go.
[144:58.43]Now let's just fry, fry, fry, fry, fry, fry, fry.
[145:05.34]Looks like I put tomato soup in there.
[145:07.62]Alright.
[145:08.12]Fry for 90 seconds aside.
[145:23.95]Okay.
[145:24.39]Good.
[145:30.33]I think.
[145:31.05]Anything else?
[145:34.49]Just transfer him onto the plate?
[145:35.85]Hot.
[145:43.79]Where's my spatula?
[145:50.23]I'm ready for this shit.
[145:52.19]I'm a flipping master at this point.
[146:03.84]Potatoes?
[146:04.24]What do you mean, potatoes?
[146:08.92]These are fine.
[146:09.34]They're fine.
[146:09.62]They're fine.
[146:10.12]Don't fucking freak me out like that.
[146:11.36]Like, another five seconds.
[146:22.33]This was on a perfect timer!
[146:23.47]They're done.
[146:32.74]No, put this down.
[146:34.62]Put it down.
[146:35.83]Put the tray down.
[146:40.05]Oh!
[146:40.55]Where's my flipper?
[146:49.54]What the... Got it.
[147:16.66]I didn't do anything.
[147:20.24]I didn't do anything.
[147:22.36]It's not fair.
[147:23.26]90 seconds.
[147:32.77]50, 60, 70, 80... I don't know!
[147:34.39]I'm... It's not even cooking on there.
[147:39.46]I can't fucking believe it.
[147:40.56]Why did that happen?
[147:52.66]Motherfucker just went through the bottom of the pan.
[147:55.94]Unbelievable.
[148:14.22]At least these are done.
[148:19.54]Let me clean up while I go here.
[148:29.35]It exploded on me.
[148:30.73]That's such bullshit.
[148:37.43]Get it on a plate, and hopefully I get four stars.
[148:39.69]Hopefully it doesn't taste the glass.
[148:43.05]I'm going to be crunching on it.
[148:44.99]This is good.
[148:46.17]I taste a heavy iron.
[148:49.74]That's a really strong iron taste.
[148:52.30]It stings, too.
[148:52.92]Is there spices on it?
[148:53.80]Is there hot sauce on here?
[148:55.98]My mouth hurts.
[148:56.68]Alright, let's go.
[149:33.32]see this I don't like why can't I just like put it down I need to get the gloves oh my god I just can't put it down why can't I just place it

[150:26.27]Hope you like it.
[150:32.64]Come on!
[150:33.18]Not enough.
[150:34.77]I lost a bunch of fame.
[150:35.77]Well, blame the... Salmon filet.
[151:04.89]I'm gonna scum this.
[151:05.87]Here we go!
[151:20.35]How do you clean it?
[151:23.85]Is it clean?
[151:31.86]It's clean.
[151:35.84]Nothing in here, right?
[151:38.50]Here we go.
[151:38.76]Now I'll get this... I'll get the pan.
[151:40.10]It's empty.
[151:42.52]Okay.
[151:43.19]What do I do now?
[151:44.45]What do I do?
[151:45.33]Okay.
[151:45.75]Pork chops.
[151:55.85]Salt, black pepper, thyme.
[151:57.00]Yep.
[152:03.42]Two, three, four...
[152:07.06]It's the time.
[152:10.20]Wait, it was six time.
[152:17.46]Six, okay.
[152:18.30]Then we need pepper salt.
[152:24.28]Oh, fuck.
[152:25.62]Turn it off, turn it off.
[152:31.84]One, two, three, four.
[152:34.34]Got it.
[152:39.51]Alright.
[152:42.40]Three, four.
[152:43.50]Alright, I got like the dinosaur droppings on there.
[152:46.78]That's it.
[152:47.32]Now we add oil to the pan and pork chop.
[152:49.74]Let's get the potatoes ready as well.
[152:51.12]I got plenty of time.
[152:54.22]It's two potatoes.
[152:57.58]Stop.
[152:57.88]Okay, I'm like panicking for no reason.
[153:00.63]Plate, potatoes.
[153:02.43]It's two.
[153:08.62]Two.
[153:10.10]Sunflower oil pork chop potato into chunks of 50 grams.
[153:13.94]And then I didn't salt them.
[153:15.98]Okay.
[153:27.28]They're all getting cooked anyways.
[153:28.32]Don't relax.
[153:30.51]Chunks.
[153:34.95]Of three.
[153:40.43]No, don't do it like that, don't be a fucking idiot.
[153:57.08]Oh shit, I did fa- How many did I cut?! !
[154:09.80]How many did I cut?
[154:13.44]It's okay.
[154:13.88]I can cook them and just... It doesn't matter.
[154:15.42]Salt them.
[154:18.08]Six grams of salt.
[154:24.84]One.
[154:25.94]Two.
[154:27.32]Three.
[154:28.53]Four.
[154:29.95]Five.
[154:31.05]Six.
[154:32.23]Come on, six.
[154:34.03]Get them on the tray.
[154:49.84]Is there a reason why this doesn't work half the time?
[154:53.46]Like, get in the fucking oven!
[154:56.79]What?
[155:00.03]What are you doing?!
[155:00.81]Go.
[155:05.10]Heat the oil.
[155:06.56]30 milliliters.
[155:18.23]Heat.
[155:19.31]Heat the oil.
[155:20.23]Here we go.
[155:21.09]I'm ready.
[155:22.81]Not fucking this up again.
[155:23.91]Here we go.
[155:24.37]One, two, three.
[155:25.91]Wait till the oil's heated.
[155:26.67]Okay.
[155:39.60]90 seconds.
[155:57.08]Alright.
[155:57.66]Phew!
[156:02.38]We're good?
[156:13.15]We're almost done.
[156:13.53]I don't know what to do with my hands right now.
[156:20.87]Alright, I gotta get ready.
[156:27.13]I need a place to put this shit.
[156:28.77]Um, move this out of the way.
[156:35.75]Okay, perfect.
[156:37.77]Clean that up.
[156:38.91]Put the tray here, onto this.
[156:40.67]Yep.
[156:41.33]Okay, timer, looking good.
[156:42.75]Spatula, where is it?
[156:44.03]The oil is burning.
[156:45.87]Oh fuck.
[156:47.23]I thought I had to wait for the oil to heat up, the oil's like on fire.
[156:49.37]Oh fuck, the potatoes!
[156:58.90]No.
[157:02.51]I only need a few.
[157:03.69]I only need six.
[157:06.49]I only need six.
[157:08.03]Okay, what about this?
[157:08.69]This is almost done, right?
[157:11.51]Flip!
[157:11.87]Where's my flipper?
[157:13.53]Okay, slow down.
[157:15.07]Slow down.
[157:15.57]Slow down.
[157:23.48]Oh, yeah.
[157:23.84]Okay, good.
[157:25.64]Shut up.
[157:32.10]Good, alright, potatoes.
[157:33.48]I need six.
[157:36.26]Which ones didn't fall on the ground?
[157:37.80]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[157:44.05]Good.
[157:45.65]Then put the pork chop on top and we're done.
[157:51.00]90 seconds aside.
[158:03.82]Missed my spatula.
[158:11.11]Come on, it's gonna go into the red in a minute.
[158:18.51]No, catch it before it falls!
[158:19.57]Catch it!
[158:21.45]Thank god.
[158:38.08]It's almost done.
[158:40.12]That's getting evenly cooked, right?
[158:41.89]It better be.
[158:48.79]Ten seconds.
[158:49.41]Nine.
[158:49.87]Eight.
[158:50.73]Seven.
[158:51.93]Six.
[158:55.56]Done.
[158:58.40]That is very haphazard.
[159:00.86]You don't get points for presentation, right?
[159:02.40]Like, this doesn't matter.
[159:04.20]Just eat it.
[159:10.07]We got our fame points.
[159:14.31]The critic is pleased.
[159:16.25]There's too much salt in the potatoes.
[159:17.69]Well... Cry me a river.
[159:25.19]Timeline has been saved.
[159:26.25]Thank god.
[159:26.79]Alright.
[159:33.24]Closing down for the night.
[159:34.20]No more orders.
[159:34.94]Let's clean up.
[159:37.36]Um...
[159:52.79]Can I just save this?
[159:53.90]I have an idea.
[159:58.15]Hold on, can I do this?
[160:33.48]I can't, like, store this in the fridge?
[160:35.52]Well, here, just... I fucking hate this.
[160:39.91]I swear to... I can't, like, keep leftovers in the... I just wasted money now.
[160:46.54]I wanted to keep leftovers somewhere.
[160:51.44]Now I have to clean all this shit up.
[160:54.20]Yeah, this is my Academy Award.
[161:06.12]Fucking up and off.
[161:07.64]Why is there a timer up here?
[161:08.58]Alright, I need to do song.
[161:15.34]Nothing on the counter needs to be cleaned, right?
[161:16.64]Give me the mop.
[161:26.55]How come I can't rotate the mop?
[161:28.93]It says rotate, but you can't rotate.
[161:37.15]This is how I usually clean the floor.
[161:38.48]I go like this.
[161:39.84]I just kind of run back and forth from side to side and just hold it in a new angle.
[161:43.42]Usually it does a pretty good job.
[161:47.16]Okay.
[161:53.42]I need to pick up the glass.
[161:59.84]I wanted to prepare... This is not prepping for tomorrow.
[162:02.52]This is bullshit.
[162:04.90]This is needing to pick up glass because I'm trying to put a bowl of soup in the fucking oven.
[162:12.06]I'm very upset about this.
[162:23.53]Alright.
[162:26.13]We good?
[162:26.43]I think we're good.
[162:27.83]Let me just move this stuff out of the way.
[162:30.55]Come here.
[162:34.08]Clean the pans.
[162:34.76]This is dirty.
[162:39.66]Uh, let's get hot water.
[162:48.27]How do I just dump it?
[162:57.23]Alright, that should be clean, right?
[163:01.86]Yeah, clean pan.
[163:03.50]Still have plenty of oil.
[163:04.36]Get the oil up here.
[163:06.84]Still have... This is like only one milliliter.
[163:08.56]Throw it away.
[163:11.46]I got plenty of chicken broth.
[163:12.88]I got plenty of sour cream.
[163:14.04]It's just still out.
[163:14.86]Can I put this in the fridge?
[163:17.64]Does this rot?
[163:19.80]I don't think it does, guys.
[163:20.66]I think we're fine.
[163:21.16]52 bucks.
[163:35.11]Reached level four.
[163:39.77]Okay.
[163:41.17]Quest reward.
[163:43.65]Cheaper liquid, I think?
[163:44.61]Um, yeah.
[163:47.83]Cheaper liquid.
[163:52.77]Cheaper spices.
[163:53.55]Probably cheap- no, cheaper liquid twice.
[163:55.95]What better tips?
[164:05.12]Dish taste tolerance.
[164:09.52]Yeah, more tips.
[164:11.18]And taste tolerance.
[164:14.18]That sounds good to me.
[164:15.40]Choose a recipe.
[164:16.02]Here we go.
[164:16.38]I already have this.
[164:24.20]I already own it.
[164:27.08]Pork chops with baked potatoes.
[164:28.28]I did it already.
[164:40.13]Expand the menu.
[164:54.04]Am I actually softlocked right now?
[164:58.26]No.
[165:05.86]I have to reload before I bought this.
[165:08.79]No, don't make me do that again.
[165:16.24]That's like an hour and a half ago.
[165:29.17]Oh no.
[165:38.26]What?
[165:39.68]Open the console?
[165:43.44]There is no developer console.
[165:52.38]I physically can't even get out of here.
[165:53.82]I have to Alt-F4 the game.
[166:00.68]No!
[166:01.34]Why?
[166:01.86]Oh, come on.
[166:02.94]This sucks.
[166:16.78]There's really no way for me to get out of here, is there?
[166:23.03]No, I'm stuck.
[166:25.83]Well, I can just do sandbox.
[166:27.68]Fuck, I was having a lot of fun.
[166:37.16]Yeah, I'm gonna go into sandbox.
[166:38.50]Damn it, that's frustrating.
[166:40.84]Oh well.
[166:49.19]Because I bought the recipe already.
[166:56.67]Just do it again.
[167:04.07]What's going on now?
[167:07.13]I bought the baked potato and I was gonna say, what the hell is happening?
[167:13.28]Sandbox mode.
[167:19.44]Let's try sand.
[167:20.64]What about the auto save?
[167:21.92]And we have to do that whole day again.
[167:24.88]What's the difference between these two?
[167:27.90]Is there a difference?
[167:28.42]I don't think you get recipes here.
[167:33.05]I don't think you get orders.
[167:39.89]Yeah, this is just... There's nothing here.
[167:42.87]You just destroy the kitchen.
[167:45.36]You just have infinite meats.
[167:47.28]There's no, like, order.
[167:48.28]Ugh.
[167:52.44]Ugh.
[168:08.94]I'm so sad right now.
[168:10.36]I'm trying to cook the propane.
[168:15.72]There we go.
[168:16.00]Is this gonna work?
[168:26.65]Let the propane simmer.
[168:32.95]Why is this not exploded?
[168:36.53]Yeah, hold on.
[168:37.07]Here.
[168:38.09]Just get a little bit of rice vinegar on here.
[168:40.14]There we go.
[168:53.65]Alright, looks good.
[168:57.33]How about some of this oregano?
[169:07.27]Sounds good.
[169:15.97]How do I get this to blow up?
[169:37.04]How do you... I'm... It's on... What the fuck?
[169:50.98]No, get it in the oven.
[170:01.22]Get a blowtorch?
[170:04.89]Alright, give me utensils.
[170:08.77]Knife.
[170:10.63]Spatula.
[170:11.13]Sponge.
[170:13.07]Just knife and just start stabbing it?
[170:14.67]Blowtorch.
[170:16.21]Okay, now let's...
[170:37.77]Jesus Christ, that scared the fuck out of me.
[170:44.83]I didn't think it was gonna happen.
[170:47.06]This shit was on the stove for like five minutes and it didn't blow up.
[170:52.68]Alright, I need to- I'm gonna go play the game.
[170:55.00]I have to reload this stupid soft lock.
[170:59.32]Throw the pizzas out the window.
[171:01.59]Yeah, I'm just gonna microwave a bunch of fruits.
[171:06.23]Microwave a pumpkin.
[171:40.46]Does this happen if you put a micro... a pumpkin in the microwave?
[171:47.84]Oh, it's making noises I don't like.
[171:53.42]Microwave some metal.
[172:13.60]Alright, that's half it.
[172:14.60]This is, like, gonna, like, irradiate the room.
[172:21.38]If you touch that right now, you would, like, turn to stone.
[172:24.79]Can I pick it up?
[172:26.05]Oh, I can.
[172:26.61]There we go.
[172:49.98]Why is it still working?
[172:56.60]Steam is coming out of the top, but... Holy shit, it actually makes a fire.
[173:19.21]Does the fire spread?
[173:19.99]Is it like The Sims?
[173:43.22]The pumpkin is black.
[173:55.78]Alright, what would it take for you to eat this?
[174:10.54]I shouldn't be able to... I need more fire.
[174:16.58]I need more explosive shit.
[174:25.51]No, come here.
[174:26.51]Drop it right here.
[174:31.88]Alright, burn.
[174:32.96]Fire.
[174:42.52]Get that out of the way.
[174:48.41]Here we go.
[174:48.87]Alright, I got a fire.
[174:53.82]Oh, come on.
[174:54.90]Stop.
[174:55.24]Come on.
[174:58.05]What?
[175:00.11]Why can you not blow these up?
[175:01.53]Can I fry-late it?
[175:09.96]I'm going to deep fry a propane tank.
[175:15.24]That's perfectly safe.
[175:24.50]There's no oil in there.
[175:25.46]Oh, I'll get oil.
[175:28.78]What's the worst oil in the world?
[175:37.51]Huh?
[175:38.35]I just got, like, a bomb dropped on me.
[175:46.68]Lime juice?
[175:47.42]Soy sauce?
[175:48.14]What has a high... Olive oil.
[175:51.44]Yeah.
[176:06.92]Okay, everything's fine.
[176:08.46]We're good to go.
[176:09.98]Turn every oven on.
[176:11.92]Is this what the last guy did?
[176:13.66]It's still cooking.
[176:22.73]Torch the place, let's go.
[176:33.89]Come on, blow up!
[176:36.56]What's with this fire?
[176:37.41]I'm trying to like, burn my eyes.
[176:53.79]Turn it around this way.
[177:19.29]My face is here.
[177:30.02]Wait, that just exploded.
[177:32.18]Why is there gas coming in?
[177:35.24]I threw a cucumber and it exploded.
[177:38.28]Is it grenade?
[177:41.45]Alright, that was fun.
[177:42.55]I need to, like, go play the fucking game now.
[177:46.13]Is that enough time for me to forget what happened?
[177:49.08]Where was... Where did I buy the recipe?
[177:59.96]The lore was just getting good.
[178:01.32]Okay, I have here and here.
[178:04.44]Do I not have... Is quick save broken?
[178:06.26]Do I not have a save before it?
[178:13.04]This is the... Is the autosave dead?
[178:16.88]Let me check.
[178:23.30]Are both dead?
[178:24.94]They're not.
[178:25.80]I don't think they are.
[178:31.17]They're not both dead.
[178:34.95]We just have to do the day before again.
[178:37.75]Alright, let me get a glass of water.
[178:41.02]I'll be right back.
[178:41.48]We're just going to pretend we didn't do... Hey, make a bug report.
[178:52.21]Yeah, don't worry.
[178:52.57]I'll mute the music for you.
[178:53.89]We'll fix it.
[178:54.37]Alright, I'll be right back.
[178:54.97]Let's get a kiss of water.
[178:56.65]Hopefully we can get through this quickly.
[178:59.58]I'll be right back.
[182:25.30]Alright, let's try this again.
[182:28.09]As severely disappointed as I am that we have to do this a third time.
[182:33.01]Because this is number three.
[182:34.03]This is three strikes, you're out.
[182:42.98]This will be strike three coming up.
[182:49.80]The first time, it went through the floor, my pan, and I had to restart.
[182:54.92]Second time, I got softlocked.
[182:56.22]Third time, let's see!
[182:57.02]Alright, we're good.
[182:59.55]This is prep.
[183:04.23]Oh, what do I need to do?
[183:05.71]For a second, I thought all the- this place was exploded, but it's not.
[183:07.97]Alright, repair.
[183:12.87]You've been waiting years for this game.
[183:14.61]I- yeah, well, I was waiting, like, at least a few months.
[183:22.36]It's fine, 28 seconds.
[183:28.04]Kitchen Nightmares OST.
[183:34.32]No, okay, I will put on the Kitchen Nightmares American OST.
[183:39.54]When we get to a new level.
[183:42.83]By the way, the Kitchen Nightmares OST is just every American reality show OST.
[183:49.86]I hate watching those shows.
[184:00.67]Five community subs just came in from anonymous.
[184:02.73]Thank you.
[184:06.81]Whoever you are.
[184:09.96]Oh, I gotta play.
[184:10.66]Okay.

[184:12.88]Fuck.
[184:17.44]Is this clean?
[184:19.34]No.
[184:19.78]There's a blend in here.
[184:32.56]Alright.
[184:32.86]We're giving this another shot.
[184:35.80]We keep doing Groundhog Day.
[184:39.32]What did I... Oh, fuck.
[184:40.72]This is before the... I had all the stuff ready to go, too.

[185:08.82]How much is in here?
[185:09.40]300.
[185:11.06]I need two more.
[185:17.49]By the way, might as well just start talking about this now so people know what's going on.
[185:22.63]Not Monday.
[185:23.29]Sunday.
[185:24.84]I will be doing a Microsoft conference.
[185:28.32]That's what I'm going to start.
[185:30.42]I'm going to pause it because I'm just wasting time.
[185:33.34]I'm doing the Microsoft conference and the one that's after it.
[185:36.23]I'm going to do E3 coverage.
[185:38.61]We're going to do an E3 stream.
[185:43.39]Okay.

[186:04.53]Give me the water.
[186:05.39]No.
[186:05.77]Water.
[186:08.53]Am I doing normie E3 coverage?
[186:10.37]If you saw my coverage last, uh, last year...
[186:16.97]I had a lot to say.
[186:19.77]A lot.
[186:23.70]You don't like salt the water, right?
[186:26.42]Fuck, you do salt the water.
[186:27.34]Don't do that yet.
[186:31.65]Yeah, I had a lot to say.
[186:46.45]6, 17, 18, 19... What?
[186:48.47]Come on!
[186:50.17]20.

[187:20.18]Not strike three.
[187:20.86]That's not strike three yet.
[187:22.42]And then we need sunflower oil and then salmon in the pan.
[187:27.26]Let's go.
[187:27.96]Sunflower oil.
[187:29.40]Ten.
[187:31.30]Make sure I don't have fishy oil on the next one.
[187:33.69]Oh, fuck you.
[187:43.39]Heat it up.
[187:44.17]Let's go.
[187:46.72]No, not the whole tray.
[187:48.11]Just the salmon.
[187:48.69]Alright.
[187:51.77]60 seconds, right?
[187:52.19]60 seconds each side.
[187:54.61]I don't even need it.
[187:58.01]I can just look at it like this.
[187:59.35]No, I need it.
[187:59.91]I need it.
[188:00.43]I need the timer.
[188:00.92]I need the timer.
[188:01.34]Potatoes are almost done.
[188:11.10]Get a plate.
[188:22.15]Just put it on the plate.
[188:23.77]From here.
[188:24.09]This seems to be a Hearthstone stream.
[188:30.17]I mean, it was a Hearthstone stream for about... That's a mask.
[188:35.10]I'm going to run out of time.
[188:36.26]Spatula.
[188:39.12]You are correct.
[188:39.74]It was a Hearthstone stream.
[188:44.02]Once.
[188:47.83]Uh-oh.
[188:47.99]They're going to be right...
[188:56.90]Flip it.
[189:03.39]Good.
[189:03.57]Alright, this is good.
[189:04.33]This is nice and clean.
[189:12.88]That was a good flip.
[189:14.98]Burnt it?
[189:15.34]No, I didn't.
[189:15.80]I did burn it a little.
[189:17.70]That's extra crispy crusty crust.
[189:19.42]It's fine.
[189:30.81]You guys don't like crispy skin?
[189:34.68]My favorite kind of salmon is crispy skin salmon.
[189:39.18]I'm cooking it the way that I like it.
[189:44.50]Yeah, that's the skin!
[189:46.57]What did you guys think that was?
[189:51.59]I like my salmon to have a good crunch.
[189:52.99]Yeah, it's really good.
[189:58.29]Why does it sound like it's burning?
[190:04.90]Done.
[190:07.56]There you go, here's your nice crispy, crunchy skin.
[190:15.55]How could I have made that any better?
[190:17.81]Explain that to me.
[190:20.33]Too much salt on the boiled potatoes.
[190:22.42]And I made a heating mistake.
[190:23.66]What heating mistake?
[190:27.51]I'm gonna be a defensive chef here.
[190:28.91]Okay, here, alright, I got, this is almost ready.
[190:31.17]So, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, boil for 60 seconds, just blend it and add sour cream.
[190:36.46]It's alright, it's right here, ready to go.
[190:38.38]Just need the chicken stock.
[191:01.02]That's fine.
[191:03.44]Chicken stock.
[191:05.96]They have fucking way too much in there.
[191:07.50]It doesn't matter.
[191:08.70]Just cook it.
[191:10.00]Boil it.
[191:10.92]I thought it was a thousand.
[191:11.72]Alright, cook it and then... Oh shit, this is tomato soup.
[191:17.46]This is tomato.
[191:18.56]It's the same color.
[191:19.51]It looks this exact same.
[191:24.59]No, don't have a meltdown here.
[191:25.83]Just fucking do it right.
[191:37.97]Alright, that's clean, right?
[191:39.61]Get it on here.
[191:41.49]Chicken stock.
[191:42.89]Chicken stock.
[191:43.37]I got a fresh one.
[191:44.01]This is not a fresh one.
[191:45.13]I'm fucked right now.
[191:47.85]There's only 300 in here.
[191:55.28]This is empty?
[191:58.00]Oh my god.
[192:09.52]Come on, need four.
[192:10.18]Close enough.
[192:15.37]700.
[192:15.57]Alright, now I need the tomatoes.
[192:17.19]I need chicken broth.
[192:19.35]Salt.
[192:20.03]Salt it.
[192:20.45]Salt it.
[192:20.91]Salt this.
[192:21.65]Salt it up.
[192:22.03]12.
[192:22.91]Okay, done.
[192:34.32]And then pepper.
[192:36.74]I wasn't prepared for this.
[192:47.64]And then that's just, uh, I need the eight, uh, tomatoes and an onion.
[193:04.28]Get it on here.
[193:06.56]And then you, uh, boil it for 60 seconds, blend it, sour cream.
[193:11.68]Good.
[193:15.51]Why is it playing this song?
[193:24.50]This makes me want to stop breaking stuff.
[193:30.89]What did I pick up?
[193:31.33]Cayenne?
[193:43.93]Got it.
[193:48.37]60 seconds and then blend.
[193:49.29]I haven't been counting.
[193:52.88]I gotta blend it.
[193:53.80]And then add sour cream.
[194:03.89]Alright, turn this shit off.
[194:06.01]Get the Doom OST on here?
[194:07.29]I will.
[194:08.35]Eventually.
[194:09.69]Turn it off.
[194:10.79]Blend it up.
[194:11.47]Sour cream.
[194:21.40]What is it, 150?
[194:23.41]Don't care.
[194:24.59]This is what you get.
[194:28.18]How did only 80 get in here?
[194:30.12]How did only 34 get in there?
[194:32.44]What are you talking about?
[194:40.84]How much is in there now?
[194:49.38]Done.
[194:50.60]Okay.
[194:51.08]Bowl.
[194:51.88]Serve.
[194:57.74]Ladle.
[194:58.86]Just get one.
[195:06.96]There are no ladles.
[195:08.64]Wait, what?
[195:20.77]You're actually supposed to dump it out?
[195:27.60]I'm surprised you're supposed to do this.
[195:40.26]I'll clean it later.
[195:42.08]Oh my fucking god, I can't believe it.
[195:43.80]Whatever.
[195:46.74]Why would you not have a ladle?
[195:48.50]Why do you have to dump it from the pot?
[195:53.02]That's no, there's no way.
[195:54.22]I definitely unlock a ladle.
[196:00.26]Oh my god, that's so fucking hard to do this.
[196:04.89]Here, extra soup.
[196:05.67]Who cares?
[196:14.39]It's so hard to pour the soup.
[196:18.08]It goes from, like, one milliliter every second to, like, 500 in a tenth of a centimeter moving your hand.
[196:28.50]There has to be a ladle.
[196:29.38]Alright, another trout.
[196:31.10]Let's go.
[196:31.32]Alright.
[196:40.80]Pepper time.
[196:41.21]Deal.
[196:43.21]All the same, right?
[196:43.87]Five?
[196:52.59]Where do you think I'm doing this?
[196:55.41]Why is it all over?
[196:55.91]Okay.
[196:58.00]Deal.
[197:10.31]I clearly clicked it five damn times.
[197:12.23]Alright, pepper.
[197:15.57]Widens in VR?
[197:17.39]They probably would update it to VR eventually, I think.
[197:19.29]Alright, get it in the oven.
[197:27.96]Baking sheets, I think, still in there.
[197:29.26]I'm not going to make the same mistake I make every time.
[197:33.46]You know what that is?
[197:34.06]It's called turning too quickly and the fish falls on the ground.
[197:38.63]One, two, three.
[197:45.14]90 seconds.
[197:47.36]Where's the timer?
[197:54.55]10 seconds had already gone by, guys.
[197:56.96]Alright.

[199:37.69]I use too much.
[199:41.57]I love that nasally feeling you get.
[199:45.31]Parsley.
[199:49.73]Done.
[199:53.18]Hot mustard does the same thing to me.
[200:02.47]There is nothing better, in my opinion, than spicy hot mustard.
[200:09.73]And I'm not talking like, I'm talking like Chinese mustard, like hot Chinese mustard is my favorite thing on Earth.
[200:16.08]I would put it on everything.
[200:18.44]Alright, I already got this pretty much ready to go.
[200:19.72]So this is 1,000 chicken broth, 20 salt, 20 pepper.
[200:25.21]Everything else is already in there.
[200:32.33]Oh, fuck.
[200:33.21]It's already here.
[200:33.97]How much is in here?
[200:35.36]Chicken broth.
[200:35.90]Nah, it's fine.
[200:38.72]I just need salt and pepper in here.
[200:42.51]20.
[200:43.77]Don't get it in the middle here.
[200:45.62]Oh, god damn it.
[200:46.62]It's gonna touch, isn't it?
[200:49.10]In the mixture, right?
[200:54.26]That's not hitting the beetroot.
[201:02.69]It fucking is.
[201:04.01]Whatever.
[201:04.51]I just need four stars.
[201:14.26]That's it, right?
[201:15.47]The 20 grams of pepper.
[201:16.99]That seems like a lot.
[201:18.41]Does this dish actually have that much pepper and that much salt in it?
[201:22.23]I'd send it back.
[201:32.27]I can't even get it in the mixer.
[201:37.28]What the fuck am I gonna do about it?
[201:40.08]We're just trying to get to where we were before.
[201:41.54]Boil.
[201:44.35]Done.
[201:45.17]Just let it cook.
[201:45.67]The worst is disgusting.
[201:50.07]I don't think I've ever even seen it before.
[201:52.03]Let's just use this opportunity to start cleaning.
[201:53.41]Alright, you can hear- that one was real.
[202:08.54]Yeah, I know you hear the fake one right now, but that one was real.
[202:15.05]That was not a, uh... That's stupid.
[202:21.03]At least the sink is clean.
[202:22.59]Almost.
[202:22.97]Here we go.
[202:24.88]Any of the spills?
[202:25.90]Not that I can see.
[202:32.10]How do you do this without overcooking the onion?
[202:34.44]You put the onion in later?
[202:39.64]You must have to just throw the onion in later.
[202:41.76]What about the floor?
[202:47.50]I missed a spill.
[202:48.54]Where?
[202:50.90]Oh, fuck, I did.
[202:51.46]You're right.
[202:52.38]This tomato soup?
[202:53.22]I'm leaving it out.
[203:06.59]Good.
[203:08.89]I'm serving this tomorrow.
[203:10.20]I could care less.
[203:17.39]Bolt.
[203:18.21]Deep bolt.
[203:24.51]And... done.
[203:28.07]Dump it.
[203:32.19]Rotate left.
[203:33.41]Rotate right.
[203:39.14]There's gotta be a better way to do this that I'm just stupid.
[203:50.52]300.
[203:50.54]Eee.
[203:50.66]That's alright.
[203:53.88]Like two milliliters.
[203:54.76]I don't give a shit.
[204:07.11]Alright.
[204:08.01]Is it time?
[204:10.31]Take the finished.
[204:11.23]Okay.
[204:11.77]This is strike three coming up.
[204:14.48]This is the day, again, that we have not been able to get through.
[204:19.14]Because of various issues.
[204:21.30]I'm leaving these both out because if they're served tomorrow, I'm going to just heat them in the microwave.
[204:26.22]Try me.
[204:26.90]You think it's a joke?
[204:28.02]It's not.
[204:40.77]Okay.
[204:43.75]We got a few minutes to clean up and prepare.
[204:46.77]Those two are done.
[204:47.51]They can stay out.
[204:50.56]Get this over this way.
[204:51.40]Did I... I didn't even use... Nah, this is done.
[204:59.78]I need at least three chicken broths that are ready.
[205:02.87]This is full.
[205:05.19]Brand new.
[205:05.61]How's this one?
[205:09.31]This is alright, too.
[205:11.67]Set them up in the right places.
[205:14.76]Get the oil back where it belongs.
[205:19.36]Up top here.
[205:21.02]This is... I can still use this.
[205:27.04]Blender.
[205:29.32]Set it right here.
[205:32.34]Salt and pepper can stay over there.
[205:33.73]I'll put these in the right spots.
[205:35.65]Is the oven still on?
[205:41.75]It is.
[205:45.33]Am I ready?
[205:49.25]I think I'm ready.
[205:49.85]Let me get some plates for the next day, too.
[205:55.03]Why would you ever honk this much?
[206:04.86]This is not how I could clean this.
[206:21.57]Here comes the panic music.
[206:25.77]And the cars.

[207:31.78]Better tips.
[207:34.82]And the tolerance level.

[211:32.07]It doesn't matter.
[211:32.77]We just need to please the critic.

[212:10.77]That's alright.
[212:11.37]Not every piece of salmon is perfect, guys.
[212:15.35]We're good to go.

[212:40.19]What if the Critic is undercover?
[212:43.25]You can always tell with Critic.
[212:50.33]You can always tell with Critic, guys.
[212:51.15]The first thing they do is look at the drapes.
[212:54.69]They look left and right like they're crossing the street when they come in.
[213:03.55]They come in and they look left, they look right.
[213:14.81]Flip!
[213:20.01]Nice, got it.
[213:20.45]Okay.
[213:22.89]Potatoes are almost done, let's get the plate.
[213:25.54]I've got the salmon down to his science.
[213:34.26]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[213:34.84]Why is it burning?
[213:36.76]What?
[213:42.73]Was it on there for too long?
[213:44.69]It was on there for too long.
[213:50.97]I think it's done.
[213:54.14]The water is burning?
[213:55.36]Yeah, pretty funny.
[213:58.00]Alright, that's it.
[213:59.40]Serve it.
[214:01.56]This ain't The Critic, who cares.
[214:09.08]And it was still perfect.
[214:11.76]Mmm!
[214:12.61]I really love what you did here.
[214:14.07]My favorite part is when it was cold and smelly and unedible in the middle.
[214:21.51]Mmm!
[214:22.65]That's how I used to make it.
[214:26.21]What did I already put on that?
[214:27.06]Did it stick?
[214:32.48]That's gonna stink.
[214:34.14]Alright, what did I already put on it?
[214:35.42]Where is it?
[214:39.12]What's already on this?
[214:41.23]There's already black pepper and dill.
[214:43.09]Black, I need one more black pepper and then thyme.
[214:54.01]Where's the thyme?
[214:55.23]Five, right?
[215:04.93]Get it in the fucking oven.
[215:14.57]This is already done.
[215:16.21]Lemons.
[215:17.29]We're ready.
[215:17.77]I can just relax.
[215:23.57]In the meantime, let's clean this out.
[215:33.51]Clean it.
[215:37.29]Nice.
[215:39.55]This is ready for whatever he throws at me if it's a stupid tomato soup and I'll be very upset about it.
[215:46.50]You'll see me scream.
[215:48.30]I swear to God, if it's tomato soup, I'm going to scream as loud as I can into the mic and break my fucking microphone.
[215:52.90]I promise.
[215:56.00]I will scream until my throat hurts into the mic as loud as I fucking can.
[216:00.84]This is a nice, expensive microphone.
[216:02.32]I will ruin it.
[216:03.10]I will break it.
[216:03.64]This is not going to happen, by the way.
[216:08.40]I'm a liar.
[216:09.12]Okay, is this ready?
[216:10.89]Almost.
[216:19.82]Just staring at the wall.
[216:23.21]Dried horseradish when it comes out.
[216:24.55]Get a plate.
[216:29.17]And I'm saving the game, so I don't have to do this another time.
[216:34.93]How we doing?
[216:36.67]By the time I get back over here, this will be ready.
[216:40.37]Three.
[216:41.91]Two.
[216:43.57]One.
[216:45.59]Didn't time it.
[216:48.02]One, two, three.
[216:51.61]Fucking asshole.
[216:52.59]God damn it.
[216:57.01]Why?
[216:57.67]Hey, perfect timing.
[217:05.96]Put it down.
[217:06.60]Put the plate down.
[217:09.18]It's just like shat in my hands.
[217:12.62]One, two, three, four, five.
[217:17.51]Lemons.
[217:19.09]Delish!
[217:21.61]Parsley.
[217:27.24]Order up.
[217:32.48]So much blood.
[217:33.22]Yeah, if that exploded in my hands like that... What's wrong with the taste?
[217:41.93]Bad cutting technique.
[217:45.82]I don't want to sound like a fucking idiot here or an asshole, but if you're going to take a full star off of the taste portion of your food because it wasn't nice looking enough, how does that affect what it tastes like?
[218:06.29]If somebody was like, well, the taste was four out of five because the lemons weren't cut well for me.
[218:13.13]I would tell that guy, you're... You're dumb.
[218:18.89]Very dumb.
[218:21.27]And then I would ban him for life from the restaurant.
[218:30.28]Alright, food critic's about to order not tomato soup.
[218:33.52]It's tomato soup.
[218:41.58]UGH!
[218:58.22]I screamed for so long, you have no idea.
[219:01.62]Oh, good, I'll eat a tomato soup.
[219:03.20]I'll take a tomato soup.
[219:04.64]One large tomato soup, please.
[219:07.06]Fucking asshole.
[219:10.87]You can hear me.
[219:11.39]I gotta get this right.
[219:22.85]Okay, I need to pause it.
[219:24.36]So, no, turn this fucking music off.
[219:26.72]I don't want to pause it because the music plays and I can't... Is there a way to stop the clock?
[219:36.04]Alright, I'm gonna try to talk and do this.
[219:37.99]Can you imagine if you went to a restaurant as a critic, and you heard that the guy was gonna make you a day-old borscht, and he was gonna serve it to you, it was cold and he was gonna serve it to you, and you came in and you knew he was gonna do that, so you ordered tomato soup, and you hear him in the kitchen so angry, whipping a fucking pot against the wall, screaming as loud as he can because he can't serve that to you.
[220:00.20]Don't you think you'd give it a zero?
[220:01.64]Or would you just leave?
[220:03.53]You wouldn't even stay for him to make this.
[220:05.01]He would just give him a zero and leave.
[220:06.81]I need tomatoes.
[220:07.69]What do I need?
[220:08.21]Stock?
[220:08.87]Water.
[220:10.35]Chicken broth, salt, pepper.
[220:15.13]Unbelievable.
[220:15.89]I can't serve this guy.
[220:18.42]Old food.
[220:19.16]700.
[220:21.66]It's got to be right for the critic.
[220:28.40]Oh my fucking god, I hate myself.
[220:52.90]Okay, done.
[220:54.28]Eight tomatoes.
[220:55.38]Salt, pepper, salt, pepper, salt, salt, salt, salt, salt, salt, salt, salt, salt, salt, salt, salt, salt, salt, salt.
[220:58.47]We're good.
[221:13.94]What's going on in the chat right now?
[221:17.16]Why do I see like a trillion timeouts?
[221:18.56]What's going on?
[221:19.80]Eight tomatoes.
[221:27.67]Onion.
[221:29.41]Good.
[221:29.99]Okay.
[221:30.99]Get it on there.
[221:33.25]That's all good.
[221:33.77]Cayenne.
[221:34.23]I forget the Cayenne every time.
[221:36.99]Shit.
[221:40.33]What do you do?
[221:40.73]What's going on?
[221:42.19]Why is it?
[221:42.61]Why is this?
[221:43.25]I fucked it up.
[221:44.43]God damn it.
[221:44.87]I have to dump the whole thing out, aren't I?
[221:46.91]Get in the mixture, please.
[222:13.86]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[222:14.38]Alright.
[222:15.16]Go.
[222:15.66]Cook.
[222:15.92]60 seconds and then blend it.
[222:43.48]Jeremy, save me.
[222:44.38]I am... I don't even know what's going on in here.
[222:49.30]You guys are getting me all twisted right now.
[222:56.96]It's the letter S too many times.
[222:58.52]Oh, well, stop doing that.
[222:59.51]What are you guys, out of your mind?
[223:03.85]Blend.
[223:04.67]Heat off.
[223:06.35]150 milliliters of... Sour cream.
[223:10.73]Surf.
[223:19.45]Look at this chat room.
[223:35.30]Dump the whole thing.
[223:36.74]Slowly, so I make sure I get it all.
[223:38.32]150.
[223:40.36]No, 150.
[223:50.85]Done.
[223:51.87]Into a bowl?
[223:54.63]Okay.
[223:57.17]Can we finally get out of this hell of doing the same damn thing over and over again?
[224:01.45]300.
[224:03.77]I can do it.
[224:04.29]Come on.
[224:04.85]Easy.
[224:18.66]How much is in there?
[224:21.02]How much is in the bowl?
[224:24.82]Almost perfect, $2.99, you fucker.
[224:32.55]Take it.
[224:37.78]I finally passed and we're not soft locked.
[224:39.60]Thank god.
[224:47.00]Too much Cayenne pepper.
[224:52.87]And I'm famous.
[224:59.52]Wait, there's a new order?
[225:00.36]I think that's fine.
[225:41.88]Delicious.
[225:43.51]Threw the shit against the wall.
[225:45.39]You don't want to be the person after that.
[225:48.73]Wrong amount of product.
[225:49.77]It was a little too cold.
[225:51.13]We're good.
[225:59.93]Any other food?
[226:01.37]New order.
[226:04.05]Fine.
[226:04.57]That doesn't matter though.
[226:06.17]Right?
[226:07.35]I've already done everything.
[227:04.43]Okay, it was, uh, pepper, thyme, dill.
[227:23.60]Horseradish.
[227:31.57]Uh, was there a dill?
[227:32.57]Pepper thyme.
[227:34.03]Pepper.
[227:37.03]Oh, hey!
[227:37.60]Congra- Graduated high school, congratulations!
[227:39.66]You graduated high school!
[227:42.32]Nice work!
[227:42.74]It was a knife.
[228:28.73]$47 I
[228:54.28]I'm just gonna do it for everything.
[228:56.00]Why cook anything?
[228:57.42]Alright, fine.
[228:58.34]Is there any more?
[228:59.98]Is there any more in here?
[229:02.56]Hold on.
[229:06.12]There's still residue in here.
[229:07.86]Hot water.
[229:13.32]Alright, that's good.
[229:17.92]Save the game.
[229:20.64]This is like making me fucking laugh.
[229:23.18]Ugh.
[229:25.54]There's still residue from the other one.
[229:36.73]We gotta add some color though.
[229:38.65]No, what are they gonna know?
[229:43.05]I'm fucking ordering this.
[229:50.17]You're gonna give it two stars?
[229:54.29]Unwanted.
[229:54.81]I didn't want water, not enough chicken broth, not enough salt.
[229:57.85]The technique though, I mean, was on par with some of the best I've ever had.
[230:01.43]Alright, we're done.
[230:06.64]Okay, we're gonna keep the tomato soup.
[230:10.36]Let's clean up.
[230:18.52]You order a soup and the person pours water into a bowl.
[230:29.46]Serves it to you.
[230:34.40]Sir, this doesn't look like the picture.
[230:39.36]Well, you know.
[230:42.07]Times are tough.
[230:46.83]Oh, you thought that was a borscht?
[230:48.05]No, no, no.
[230:48.47]It was a borscht tea.
[230:51.97]Oh, okay.
[230:52.97]I'm sorry for my misunderstanding.
[230:58.17]Okay, it's clean.
[230:58.91]Let's clean this up.
[231:09.68]These last a long time.
[231:14.34]Salt and pepper right next to each other.
[231:20.48]I really don't like the panic music.
[231:22.22]Seriously, it's fucking with my head.
[231:37.37]I'm not doing it to the beat, it just looks like that.
[232:12.09]I'm not gonna save that tomorrow.
[232:15.91]I hope you get fucking arrested.
[232:21.69]I feel like- I feel like people actually do that shit.
[232:25.67]I don't know why that's making me laugh so much, but I feel like people do that at, like, restaurants.
[232:33.14]What's wrong with people?
[232:36.56]Wasn't there, like, the guy, like, standing in the lettuce in Burger King or something?
[232:42.07]We laugh, and you think that's a joke, but people are fucked.
[232:58.56]That's why eating at restaurants sometimes is scary.
[233:01.00]Because you don't know if the person's just pissing the tomato soup for no reason.
[233:11.81]How do you know that somebody didn't just like dehydrated like bright orange piss into the tomato soup?
[233:21.15]You don't know.
[233:21.63]There's no way for you to know that.
[233:23.43]You just hope.
[233:28.02]Alright, let's go.
[233:28.74]I'm just gonna save the vegetables.
[233:32.20]Everything's clean.
[233:33.72]Is the oven on still?
[233:35.18]Turn it off.
[233:36.52]Let's repair stuff while I have a minute.
[233:41.89]Come on, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[233:43.27]Pick up the phone.
[233:50.63]Alright, we're good.
[233:51.05]Is there a little burn mark there?
[233:54.51]Okay.
[234:03.49]Excellent.
[234:03.79]223 bucks.
[234:11.48]Yeah, but there's just no way to know.
[234:12.80]I don't know.
[234:18.02]You guys have ever, like, gone to, like, Yelp?
[234:21.34]And this is what's the scariest thing, because anybody could just write anything they want, sometimes.
[234:26.30]Like, what if you went to, like, a Yelp review, and the person who gave them one star, and they said that there were rats everywhere?
[234:31.52]What if that's not even real?
[234:33.48]Just, like, astroturfing, and, like, gaslighting, and... No, there are no rats in my restaurant!
[234:39.96]There were rats everywhere!
[234:42.18]And then the owner, like, hires 30 people to write, like, 29 reviews that are all five stars.
[234:48.24]And then they got, like, the guy that, like, didn't like his soup.
[234:51.29]So he says that there were rats and cockroaches and stuff.
[234:53.59]Who do you fucking, who do you, how are you supposed to believe?
[234:56.19]You can't believe anybody.
[235:00.57]You have to go into the restaurant and walk around the kitchen and meet all the chefs.
[235:07.16]And then sit there and watch them make the food.
[235:09.90]For you to get the real, whatever you could possibly do.
[235:16.07]They won't let you do that.
[235:20.16]Yeah, but if you... I know you... Yeah, that's what I mean.
[235:23.86]You're putting, like, complete trust.
[235:29.02]No, I don't want fast.
[235:30.36]Unbreakable bottles.
[235:32.60]No.
[235:33.26]Heatproof gloves.
[235:37.51]Let's get some better tips.
[235:41.63]Equipment repair is a faster...
[235:48.94]Overtime for dishes extended.
[235:53.08]Longer prep.
[235:54.48]Yeah, I want some more prep.
[235:56.87]And then, now we don't get softlocked.
[236:00.57]Thank God.
[236:03.31]It worked.
[236:09.64]Thank God.
[236:12.04]Oh, I'm so happy we can actually continue.
[236:19.33]No, no, no, no, no!
[236:37.81]This fucking place is haunted, man.
[236:44.47]Okay, I've only got... How much time?
[236:45.91]I've got four... I've got some time.
[236:47.79]What did that... What did they even tell me to do?
[236:50.47]I gotta prep.
[236:52.55]Prep, prep.
[236:53.21]Tomato soup.
[236:54.13]Prep the tomato soup.
[236:58.60]That's prepped.
[237:07.18]Make borscht.
[237:09.84]Make... Make borscht.
[237:11.34]Where's my... Where's the other pot?
[237:16.24]There it is.
[237:17.96]Okay, this shit's got to go.
[237:20.10]I'm going to make it fresh.
[237:22.85]You know, just like Wendy's.
[237:27.93]Fresh, never frozen.
[237:30.69]All beef patties.
[237:34.17]They come in and they're freshly cooked.
[237:38.72]They're still cooked in a microwave, but they come in fresh every day.
[237:50.97]Don't call me a sellout.
[237:53.43]You hear what I just said?
[237:54.05]Okay, um, what am I doing?
[238:01.01]I need, okay, I need, um... I keep picking up and putting down the same pot.
[238:08.76]Focus!
[238:10.42]It's a thousand of chicken broth.
[238:22.28]Didn't Wendy's stop cooking on the flat top?
[238:27.72]They used to cook on the flat top every time, right?
[238:29.94]They don't do that anymore, do they?
[238:30.80]I need another one of these.
[238:36.53]Back like in the 80s and 90s, they used to cook on the flat top.
[238:39.07]They don't cook on the flat top still, do they?
[238:48.01]They don't cook anything.
[238:51.53]Do they still...
[238:57.98]I gotta look this up.
[239:01.47]Does Wendy's still grill their burgers?
[239:28.70]I'm fairly confident the normal... What if he uses flash cooking method?
[239:32.54]It utilizes a timed clamshell grill.
[239:34.50]You place the patties down in two rows, solve them, and close the grill, which heats the internal temperature to proper safety levels for a certain time.
[239:48.08]Holy shit, they still do it.
[239:52.58]That's McDonald's, not Wendy's.
[239:54.20]Oh, fuck.
[239:57.24]Wow.
[239:59.40]I thought- I thought they all did it now.
[240:00.72]I thought they all fucking didn't grill anymore.
[240:02.55]They still grill!
[240:05.45]Well fuck yeah, Wendy's.
[240:06.89]Keep it up.
[240:08.93]Got some of the best chicken sandwiches I've ever had.
[240:12.07]Junior Bacon Cheeseburger's the best fucking meal I've ever had.
[240:17.66]Was that reverse fucking- reverse sponsored- reverse?
[240:21.12]Like I fucking flipped it on you.
[240:22.24]You thought I was talking shit and then I correct- I got like corrected on stream and it's like, whoa, fuck!
[240:28.74]I'm not sponsored by Wendy's, by the way, at all.
[240:31.12]Let me make that really clear.
[240:33.04]Not even a fucking centimeter.
[240:34.46]They don't even know my name.
[240:41.51]I've just eaten their hamburgers once.
[240:51.34]Sponsored by Burger King.
[240:53.31]No one will ever... I will never have a sponsorship because they watch this stream and then they go, no, I'm not gonna sponsor this guy.
[241:00.33]He's fucking freaking me out.
[241:02.91]I got an email one time about somebody looking for a sponsorship and they watched a stream and then they ghosted me for the rest.
[241:09.18]They'd never return my call.
[241:11.43]They were like, yeah, we'll check out your stream, man.
[241:12.91]Sounds fun.
[241:13.43]I'm like, yeah, check it out.
[241:15.03]And the person literally, I think they, every time I call that person now, it goes right to voicemail every time.
[241:21.02]That means I'm blocked, right?
[241:33.42]I still call every few months.
[241:35.88]Alright, focus.
[241:37.34]I've wasted so much time.
[241:38.90]How much is in here?
[241:40.30]I need a mother chicken to lay some chicken broth into that fucking pot.
[241:57.53]Parsley.
[241:58.85]Get in there.
[241:59.42]Carrot.
[242:08.83]And then beats.
[242:10.27]Five, right?
[242:15.46]And then one onion.
[242:20.26]We've already talked about the fast food chains in this channel.
[242:26.63]Did I gain time?
[242:31.57]What is happening?
[242:34.84]No, it's just
[242:37.74]Alright, I didn't salt the fucking water.
[242:39.56]Just get everything out.
[242:43.84]Now, Wendy's, Burger King, and McDonald's are really the only three for burgers that you really put in one list together.
[242:54.78]I know everyone's like, well, what about Arby's?
[242:56.38]And what about this place?
[242:58.06]No, no, no, no, no.
[242:59.22]It's Wendy's, Burger King, McDonald's.
[243:00.36]Wendy's is the best one.
[243:05.63]Those are the three fighters that are competing.
[243:08.83]It's not like, oh, in and out!
[243:09.75]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[243:20.20]I didn't fucking prep the damn salmon.
[243:21.74]Alright, so this salmon filet, we got salt and black pepper.
[243:39.01]No, the other ones shouldn't be on the list.
[243:42.37]There's a bunch of different categories.
[243:46.65]McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's have thousands and thousands of stores.
[243:51.02]And it really bothers me when people start to talk about how they think they know about fast food.
[243:58.46]And they really get involved and they start to talk to me about fast food.
[244:02.20]And I'll... You're wrong, Jeremy.
[244:03.76]And everything you fucking say is wrong.
[244:05.72]And it gets me really livid.
[244:07.56]People start to tell me that you put lettuce on your hamburger.
[244:10.24]Of course I do!
[244:11.48]I put lettuce on my hamburger.
[244:12.28]It's the fucking best condiment to put on your hamburger.
[244:14.09]And a little bit of mayonnaise.
[244:15.05]And people get really fucking mad at me.
[244:17.25]And... It's the music.
[244:20.23]Turn it off.
[244:22.95]Uh, new station.
[244:23.73]New station.
[244:27.10]Uh, sorry.
[244:27.70]I'm really sorry.
[244:28.22]I don't know what the hell came over me there.
[244:32.49]Uh, well, here we go.
[244:33.47]I feel better.
[244:45.24]That's good.
[244:46.82]Sunflower oil and put it in the pan.
[244:53.48]I started making this stupid fucking soup, I swear to God.
[244:57.92]I'm buying another pan.
[245:12.84]Make the soup in real life?
[245:16.48]Is it actually this easy to do this?
[245:19.53]It can't be, right?
[245:22.99]Salt, and a bunch of salt, and then the two potatoes.
[245:37.39]Skiiick.
[245:43.92]It's fine.
[245:44.80]I almost just put the salmon into the pot.
[245:53.34]Boil them up.
[245:53.80]Let's go.
[245:56.24]Oil in the pan.
[245:57.94]Same time.
[245:59.26]10 milliliters.
[246:01.76]Nine is enough.
[246:02.85]No, it's not.
[246:04.11]Get it right.
[246:06.11]It's too much.
[246:08.19]What was I doing with these?
[246:11.63]Oh, right.
[246:11.99]For that.
[246:12.37]Okay.
[246:13.19]Salmon.
[246:19.80]Okay.
[246:21.18]Let me crack my knuckles here.
[246:23.06]Can you hear that?
[246:23.48]Never mind.
[246:32.14]Oh!
[246:39.46]Let me continue to prep this.
[246:42.12]What do I need to put in there?
[246:43.00]Salt and pepper, right?
[246:44.33]12 and 12?
[246:45.47]Correct me if I'm wrong here.
[246:46.35]12 and 12, right?
[246:46.67]It's 12 salt, 12 pepper.
[246:51.06]Right?
[246:55.86]Wrong.
[247:09.69]There was a fucking grenade in here.
[247:12.23]Why?
[247:12.59]I fucking can't.
[247:19.36]They're done.
[247:20.18]They're done.
[247:20.60]They're done.
[247:21.70]You know what?
[247:22.22]They're just done.
[247:23.10]And that's what there is.
[247:24.44]That's all there is to it.
[247:25.40]No, flip it.
[247:31.08]There's no water in here.
[247:32.80]Flip the salmon.
[247:36.17]Who cares?
[247:50.78]Is this even cooking?
[247:53.08]What is going on?
[248:02.04]Cook!
[248:05.87]Cook!
[248:07.05]What are you... Jesus!
[248:34.30]Little crispy.
[248:35.05]I don't know what happened there.
[248:35.87]Yeah, you can do like a little drizzle.
[248:42.01]What's wrong with a little drizzle?
[248:46.19]If I do salmon, I do like a little drizzle of olive oil at the end.
[248:58.94]Different color.
[249:00.49]It's fine.
[249:09.40]Is that a potato?
[249:10.06]No, these are yams.
[249:19.24]Almost done.
[249:21.80]Come on.
[249:23.26]That doesn't matter.
[249:33.08]Mmm, fresh meat.
[249:34.57]Mmm, crunchy.
[249:38.14]Not enough salt.
[249:39.72]Whatever.
[249:41.36]Ian, a critic.
[249:41.90]Who cares?
[249:44.18]So, let's... There we go.
[249:46.43]Tomato soup.
[249:47.45]I got that ready to go right now.
[249:51.31]Perfect.
[250:15.37]Not too much.
[250:15.91]There we go.
[250:21.64]Order up.
[250:27.12]This is the best tomato soup I've ever had.
[250:29.66]What's that flavor I'm getting?
[250:31.42]What's that smell?
[250:31.84]What's next?
[250:44.40]Okay, I was right in the middle of making this.
[250:47.44]So, what was it?
[250:49.90]It's 20 grams of salt, 20 grams of pepper, and then I'm ready to go.
[251:04.67]Nice.
[251:05.63]Where's the pepper?
[251:06.51]Right there.
[251:13.52]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.
[251:14.42]Alright, get it all in there.
[251:16.04]Done.
[251:16.22]Okay.
[251:16.40]120 seconds.
[251:16.74]Get a bowl.
[251:17.14]I'm going to keep this as long as I can.
[251:42.90]Don't break it.
[251:45.36]I don't care if a week goes by, I'm gonna still serve it.
[251:50.29]There's parsley in there.
[251:52.97]The onion!
[251:54.09]Every time the onion.
[252:22.21]Alright, everything should be on time now.
[252:27.51]No, not quite.
[252:28.33]Take the onion out.
[252:34.81]Alright, that's whatever.
[252:35.77]Smash a plate and put it in the soup.
[252:38.53]Um, no.
[252:43.96]I'm not gonna smash a... This fucking onion, I swear to god.
[252:57.28]You keep sticking your hands in?
[253:04.81]Nothing else, right?
[253:05.67]That's it.
[253:06.29]Pour the liquid into a deep plate and serve it hot.
[253:10.69]Yum.
[253:11.79]Done.
[253:11.97]A little more.
[253:16.73]That's good.
[253:19.19]Where's that plate?
[253:21.13]Sick.
[253:23.17]Can't wait to serve this for the next six straight days.
[253:26.32]In fact,
[253:29.13]Yeah.
[253:32.13]I'm gonna be conservative on our servings now.
[253:44.12]Now, I really wanted more soup.
[253:45.40]I get to serve it more.
[253:49.14]Too much pepper, too much salt.
[253:51.28]Whatever.
[253:51.90]It's a lie.
[253:57.93]Any more?
[254:00.95]Salmon.
[254:07.03]Just in case something bad happens.
[254:09.59]I'm lying to the customer?
[254:17.83]Oh, this cutting board is really dirty.
[254:19.45]Where's my pepper and salt?

[258:26.37]Alright, so that's, uh, sunflower oil, pork chops, potato, and then we bake the potatoes.
[258:33.17]I gotta do the two potatoes and then six chunks.

[275:58.71]Well, you don't want that much salt.
[276:00.31]10 is enough.
[276:07.09]Dude, I've got this secret technique.
[276:09.50]I'm gonna make, like, three or four tomato soups in, like, three or four of these.
[276:14.52]And just have all of it done.

[279:47.49]Can I get a soup order that's coming up?
[279:49.03]Let's get a soup order.
[279:49.81]Come on.
[279:56.04]Hit me with the double time here.

[280:07.82]It's ready.
[280:15.62]I'm gonna drive by Honk unless you cook the sponge.
[280:20.36]Alright, I will serve the next person that orders food a sponge on a plate with olive oil on it.
[280:33.45]I wasn't timing this.
[280:35.55]It's fine.
[280:41.75]Look at how much time I got.
[280:43.65]Once you start preparing...
[280:46.89]It's just delicious food.
[280:54.30]Fry the sponge.
[280:56.16]I don't think you can... I don't think I can.
[281:00.65]Yeah, broken plate soup, just... Okay, put... Take a plate, break a plate, put the broken plate in the plate, and serve it.
[281:26.87]How do I get out of this?
[281:30.30]Okay, this is demonstrating.
[281:33.86]Serve a blowtorch.
[281:34.84]Serve just a thing of chicken broth.
[281:38.62]Not even put it in a plate.
[281:39.44]I'm talking just put this on top of a serving tray and put it in the window.
[281:47.57]It's like, did you order this or did you go to the grocery store?
[281:56.92]Boiled sponge soup.
[282:01.74]With a straw.
[282:03.87]This takes too long.
[282:13.83]I like just going to the restaurant and ordering and then talking about politics while you drink wine and then it finally comes to you.
[282:26.18]And then when the waiter comes over with the food, you have a two-second panic attack where you're like, oh, yeah, let me move some stuff out of the way for you.
[282:34.10]Is that enough room?
[282:34.90]You've got to move everything.
[282:36.10]Just fucking take everything and just take your hand and just slide it across.
[282:40.36]Do you have enough room to put this here?
[282:41.52]Oh, yeah, that's me.
[282:42.14]That's mine.
[282:53.91]Plate.
[282:59.86]And the waiter says, watch out, that plate is hot, hot plate!
[283:04.12]Oh, okay, I'm gonna touch it.
[283:06.95]You don't listen at all.
[283:11.25]You wait till he's out of the earshot and out of view, and you immediately just start grabbing it and eating it.
[283:18.17]And you have this weird internal panic where you think that he's gonna come look at you, he's gonna see that you didn't listen to him.
[283:24.05]He's gonna be like, fucking idiot, I told him not to do that.
[283:27.86]You're, like, sneaking the food before you're supposed to be eating it.
[283:40.90]No complaints at all.
[283:42.88]Heating mistake.
[283:44.90]You gave me almost five stars across the board, and I made a mistake?
[283:49.81]Let's get some soup in here!
[283:54.43]Thank you.
[284:38.58]I didn't have to spend any money.
[284:39.59]That's the best part.
[284:40.21]I'm not spending money.
[284:41.11]I'm just gaining income.
[284:48.86]Fish.
[284:49.16]Oh, I wasn't prepared for this.
[285:24.46]You licked the plate and sensed that there was fish on there.
[285:34.69]The temperature.
[285:36.05]Oh, let me tell you, I just wish that there was a fish on there.
[285:39.21]The plate was nice and warm and I licked, I tasted the fish flavoring from the fish being on there, but I just wish there was a fish on there.
[285:55.17]God damn it.
[285:56.85]I don't want to make another- I want to make that duck soup!
[286:00.51]Okay, I can't lose fame.
[286:03.99]Can I put this back in the fridge?
[286:08.81]Yes, I can.
[286:16.71]Oh, shit!
[286:17.36]No, no, no, I'm not ready for this.
[286:20.42]I wasn't prepared- Give me soup water!
[286:23.04]Okay, wait, wait, slow down, slow down.

[293:44.05]How many- 1000 milliliters is what?
[293:46.14]How many cups of pee is that?
[293:49.14]Very dehydrated.
[294:02.66]Where's that plate?
[294:07.58]Where's my plate with the potatoes on it?
[294:37.19]Tasty.
[294:39.39]Fame points, we've leveled up.
[294:41.47]Complaints.
[294:42.61]There's too much salt on that.
[294:44.65]Hooray!
[294:46.41]Closing up for the day.
[294:47.11]Let's clean the pans.
[295:01.27]Um, I have an idea.
[295:02.04]Do I have an idea?
[295:07.07]I have an idea.
[295:09.38]We'll see how it works tomorrow.
[295:10.76]I'm gonna keep my piss.
[295:19.67]When somebody orders a tomato soup or a borscht, I'm gonna put it back on the burner for like 10 seconds.
[295:30.90]Right?
[295:51.85]A day old soup, it's way more than a day old.
[295:59.26]That's about four days old.
[296:09.61]These are ready.
[296:11.25]I'm going to clean the stove.
[296:18.63]That's how you get maggots.
[296:25.17]How much time do I got?
[296:26.39]Three minutes, we're good.
[296:32.63]Oh, I got plenty of time, so seven cents, that's easy.
[296:38.35]Five cents.
[296:39.72]That's nothing.
[296:41.36]Don't need a new sink right now.
[296:42.34]Wait, do I need a new sink?
[296:48.42]I don't think I need a new... No, I don't need a new... Put the phone down.
[296:52.65]Can I get it from here?
[296:55.57]Did the phone go out the window?
[297:00.13]No, it's right there.
[297:02.05]Oh, it is a ghost phone.
[297:06.69]There he is.
[297:12.79]Next mode.
[297:13.93]Empty folder.
[297:15.96]Internet radio.
[297:20.54]Well, let's play it.
[297:21.54]Turn it on.
[297:29.78]Is he doing it?
[297:30.32]Okay, I don't hear anything.
[297:34.12]I need the mop.
[297:38.96]Where's the mop?
[297:48.11]There's so much broken glass everywhere.
[297:52.77]Pick it up!
[297:56.81]Alright.
[297:58.63]That's good enough.
[298:04.54]This is gonna be crazy.
[298:16.80]This is a weapon.
[298:27.23]Okay.
[298:30.03]Any more glass?
[298:39.35]We're good.
[298:41.09]Give me my trophy.
[298:47.29]Let's go.
[298:47.65]$257.
[298:47.67]Tomorrow we're getting inspected.
[298:56.00]It's a great chance.
[298:57.48]Wait, the water.
[298:58.84]The water is still on.
[299:12.51]No.
[299:14.91]It's been on for a full day.
[299:18.42]Am I going to come into like a flooded kitchen?
[299:29.26]Oh, God.
[299:31.38]That's not that much.
[299:32.18]It's okay.
[299:33.19]Both faucets were on.
[299:34.49]Today's special is this.
[299:37.45]Got plenty of it.
[299:51.26]The special is the soup.
[299:52.48]I need to fucking relax.
[299:53.68]The special is the soup.
[299:56.58]I have enough.
[299:57.78]I definitely have enough to do three servings.
[300:01.74]I'm gonna get it on the burner, because I'm gonna heat it up when somebody orders it.
[300:13.03]Do I need to do any prep?
[300:13.95]Maybe some fish?
[300:19.23]I'm gonna just get...
[300:21.02]What should I prep?
[300:22.32]The special is the soup.
[300:26.85]But I can't take one of these out.
[300:28.63]Who knows what it's going to be.
[300:31.59]But yeah, I'm going to need a bunch of potatoes.
[300:33.19]Let's get potatoes.
[300:35.44]Let's get, like, just... Let's boil two potatoes.
[300:40.88]Let's boil... Let's boil four potatoes.
[300:53.82]Salt that water up with 20... 20 ounces of salt.
[300:59.60]21 just for a little bit of extra kick.
[301:07.57]Let's do this with 4.
[301:14.81]I feel like it's going to be a salmon day.
[301:16.13]I really do.
[301:16.55]Alright, boil those.
[301:19.21]Let's get... Let's get...
[301:22.38]four more potatoes onto the tray.
[301:24.47]Let's cut them up.
[301:33.57]The pork chops that inevitably will be coming out here.
[301:38.10]Let's get them right there.
[301:39.22]Okay.
[301:44.52]Let's cut them up.
[301:59.18]Good enough.
[302:04.40]Good enough.
[302:05.82]Salt the fuck out of them.
[302:08.04]Like, a hilarious amount that is unedible.
[302:10.46]Like, 200 grams.
[302:11.66]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[302:20.71]That looks good.
[302:24.07]Did 6 on each.
[302:26.04]Get them on the tray.
[302:26.58]Okay.
[302:31.41]Get them into the oven.
[302:32.67]And I'll turn the oven on.
[302:36.89]Prepped?
[302:38.29]How are these doing?
[302:38.80]Nice and prepped?
[302:43.54]Let's start the day.
[302:44.72]Three, two, one, action.
[302:48.50]What do you got?
[302:54.90]Soup.
[302:55.72]Here we go.
[303:07.37]Done.
[303:09.79]Nice and hot.
[303:22.08]Let's be scarce on this.
[303:24.00]One.
[303:24.20]Let's do like... That's enough.
[303:32.67]Nice and piping hot.
[303:43.70]I'm a little too cold still.
[303:47.60]Is this fruit punch?
[303:52.19]No, it's not fruit punch.
[303:53.53]Oh, alright.
[303:54.21]Sure thing.
[303:54.55]These are done.
[304:11.43]How much do I have left in here?
[304:13.77]I'm getting really... I'm getting scarce here.
[304:21.38]I can really only do this one more time.
[304:33.03]Just start diluting the soup.
[304:34.85]I don't think it works like that.
[304:37.83]Food critic is here.
[304:39.93]I'm ready.
[304:43.10]Throw something at me.
[305:07.27]Fuck.
[305:14.80]Shit!
[305:15.31]Hold on, save it.
[306:09.95]Is it- What am I gonna do about this?
[306:11.21]I don't wanna make a whole nother soup.
[306:32.53]I should've given the last person fucking way less.
[306:43.96]God damn it.
[306:48.70]I don't have time for this.
[306:51.54]That's perfect soup.
[306:52.44]I'm not throwing that away.
[306:54.04]I sound like the people on Kitchen Nightmares.
[306:55.48]That's perfect soup.
[306:57.90]It's not.
[306:58.58]It's not.
[307:00.34]It's not perfect.
[307:02.56]What's wrong with it?
[307:04.90]Dump it.
[307:13.59]Until you get that through your fucking thick skull.
[307:18.25]Wait, any water in here?
[307:22.11]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[307:24.83]Carrot.
[307:26.69]Can I make a triple batch?
[307:34.39]How much chicken broth?
[307:35.01]1,000?
[307:35.03]1,000.
[307:35.05]I don't have 1,000.
[308:08.48]Where the hell is this going?
[308:10.84]That's enough.
[308:11.66]What a perfect number!
[308:12.68]20, 20, and 20.
[308:44.07]Go.
[308:47.18]Done.
[308:47.64]Boil.
[308:50.10]Not much longer.
[308:51.10]I want to soap up some of those fucking tomatoes.
[309:15.13]Why is the onion cooking?
[309:17.81]Why is the carrot not cooking?
[309:24.94]Why is the carrot fucking not cooking?
[309:29.37]Oh, I gotta play whack-a-mole.
[309:31.83]Oh my god.
[309:36.41]God damn it.
[309:54.05]No, just put...
[310:26.65]No, the parsley's not cooking, is it?
[310:32.17]That fucking carrot.
[310:39.06]Alright, we're good.
[310:47.30]Wash your hands in this soup.
[310:49.10]Take the parsley out.
[310:52.73]Whack-a-mole.
[310:53.31]What's coming up next that's gonna start burning?
[310:54.55]Onion?
[310:54.75]Onion?
[310:57.18]Alright, get the onion out of there.
[311:08.65]Pull up onto the beets.
[311:15.23]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, off.
[311:17.33]Bowl.
[311:20.31]Can't believe I had to make a fresh fucking soup for this guy.
[311:29.22]Why am I doing this?
[311:32.18]Why the hell would I waste this?
[311:41.66]I've already got half of it done.
[311:43.44]It's already done.
[311:59.93]What do you mean, didn't save?
[312:00.73]Yeah, it didn't.
[312:01.71]Right here.
[312:07.25]It's fine.
[312:07.63]We're good.
[312:09.45]This should work.
[312:14.06]See?
[312:14.80]You guys were so concerned about that.
[312:19.98]Not enough pepper.
[312:21.02]Yeah, it's because it was diluted in its own juices.
[312:26.40]New order.
[312:27.02]Tomato soup.
[312:29.97]I got that right here.
[312:30.75]Where am I going to put my other trophy?
[312:41.15]It's my trophy storage unit.
[312:50.65]Okay.
[312:51.97]Tomato soup.
[312:52.86]Give me a bowl.
[312:53.30]I already have a bowl.
[312:55.36]It's already done.
[313:16.18]That's 4.5 stars.
[313:17.72]Or 4.3.
[313:18.02]4.33.
[313:18.14]I still have these potatoes in here.
[313:35.14]Let me move this out of the way.
[313:42.66]You guys think I'm thinking crazy, but I have an idea.
[313:46.31]I'm going to save.
[313:47.75]Alright, hear me out.
[313:48.65]I'm going to make like two or three parts of each of these soups.
[313:52.91]And I'm going to pour them in like 10 bowls and store them like over here.
[313:58.79]Just in the corner.
[314:00.33]And then I'll have the pot the pots will be completely and totally ready to be used.
[314:06.54]I'll have like 10 five of each soup ready to go.
[314:13.41]Yeah, that's what I'm doing when I close.
[314:16.76]That's a pretty good idea, I think.
[314:19.64]Alright, what the hell am I doing?
[314:25.99]The trout.
[314:26.37]I already have a trout that I was going to use before.
[314:28.87]There it is.
[314:32.73]We need a peppered thyme dill.
[314:36.68]Five of each.
[314:43.97]Where's the dill?
[314:48.29]And I'll do that with potatoes too!
[314:49.96]How am I gonna make all this food and only make it once and just serve it?
[314:57.96]Just cut up like a hundred potatoes and boil like a ton of potatoes so they're always ready.
[315:05.79]Black- what did I just do?
[315:08.31]Dill, pepper, and thyme.
[315:14.67]Where's the time?
[315:22.16]Get this baked.
[315:24.66]Oh, fuck this person.

[320:56.32]One, two, three, five slices?
[321:00.03]Pour the liquid into a deep plate?

[322:00.10]I can get that done.
[322:00.70]It's not gonna be perfect, but who cares.
[322:06.79]I can at least get to serve it and I won't lose points.

[323:23.41]What did you want?
[323:23.81]Who cares?
[323:24.51]I don't care.
[323:25.11]Just put the potatoes on this.
[323:39.78]That's good enough.
[323:40.24]That's fine.
[323:40.98]It was terrible, but that's fine.

[324:27.77]173 grams!
[324:29.23]Is it...
[324:57.16]Yeah, why did I do two duck breasts?
[325:00.21]It asks for two, right?
[325:04.81]Just don't waste it.
[325:05.65]Save it.
[325:08.41]That looks fucking gross.
[325:09.58]Well, it's alright.
[325:10.10]You don't have to eat it.
[325:13.24]Alright, I'm gonna... Pork chops, baked potatoes...
[325:28.67]Wash your hands.
[325:29.35]No, I refuse.
[325:32.65]Yeah, I'll wash my hands when I'm dead.
[325:34.65]You know what I mean?
[325:38.92]Okay, we need oil.
[325:40.06]How much water do I need on that?
[325:44.31]Salt.
[325:44.81]Black pepper.
[325:45.19]Thyme.

[326:04.70]Pepper.
[326:13.09]Alright.
[326:13.81]Oil.
[326:16.79]Oil.
[326:18.37]Are these burning?
[326:20.51]Almost.
[326:20.77]No.
[326:21.05]Oil.
[326:21.36]I broke the oil.
[326:23.48]The oil shattered into the ground.
[326:36.38]I'm going to start making my signature move here.
[326:54.92]You ready?
[326:56.66]Turn this off.
[326:59.70]Okay, signature move.
[327:39.85]Is this burning yet?
[327:41.69]No, it's good.
[328:10.89]Going fine so far.
[328:11.77]Alright.
[328:12.11]Let me keep this going in my brain.
[328:15.49]So I need more.
[328:17.13]I need this pot back.
[328:28.57]All this cooked already.
[328:29.64]I need to throw this shit in the trash.
[328:38.36]Borscht flourished.
[328:46.83]I'm gonna serve this when there's one second left so I have all the time in the world to make, like, three different soups.
[328:54.05]And the thing is, these can exponentially increase.
[328:57.67]I'll eventually have food cooked for, like, a week.
[329:00.65]Two weeks.
[329:02.65]I won't even have to do anything.
[329:05.90]Can you select that, please?
[329:07.20]Thank you.
[329:09.84]How's it look?
[329:10.28]Almost done?
[329:10.98]Get a plate.
[329:24.93]Good.
[329:26.19]Alright, hold that off.
[329:27.99]I have four minutes to keep this going, what I wanted to do.
[329:32.92]Alright, here we go.
[329:34.20]So when I thought a thousand... I'm just going to eyeball it.
[329:37.14]Like Grandma used to do.
[329:37.92]A thousand milliliters of water.
[329:43.31]Grandma didn't use a recipe.
[329:44.43]She fucking just threw a bunch of stuff in a pot and just hoped it was going to taste good.
[329:48.09]And that's how you got spaghetti.
[329:49.23]I don't think the lasagna was invented.
[329:56.39]It's 20, right?
[329:56.99]20 and 20?
[329:57.61]No, it's chicken broth.
[330:03.82]It's chicken broth.
[330:05.76]It's a thousand chicken broth, isn't it?
[330:07.12]Right?
[330:07.70]Is it chicken broth or is it water?
[330:15.62]It's a thousand chicken broth.
[330:25.66]How much time do I got?
[330:27.24]Three minutes.
[330:29.52]I need a little bit more chicken broth.
[330:36.02]And then I can use this for... It's gonna be perfect.
[330:41.60]How much is in there?
[330:42.82]938?
[330:42.84]A little bit more.
[330:46.00]What?
[330:50.00]Okay, yeah, there's no... Okay, that's fine.
[330:52.08]Alright, now I got chicken broth in there.
[330:54.68]20 and 20, salt and pepper.
[331:14.98]Okay, now we get the ingredients.
[331:17.88]Five.
[331:19.42]One, two, three, four, five.
[331:23.55]It is a piece of parsley.
[331:25.75]It's a carrot.
[331:27.62]And it's an onion.
[331:28.68]Don't step on that food.
[331:30.06]Onion.
[331:31.60]Shake it up a little bit.
[331:35.90]Fucking fantastic.
[331:36.82]I'm glad.
[331:37.96]That's wonderful.
[331:39.02]I love it.
[331:39.40]I'm very happy about what just happened.
[331:41.56]Everything's great.
[331:42.06]Nothing's wrong.
[331:43.20]Nothing's wrong at all.
[331:46.72]It's going under the beets.
[331:55.15]It's in.
[331:55.41]It doesn't matter.
[332:01.54]We're good?
[332:02.56]Boil.
[332:03.76]Go.
[332:05.24]Okay.
[332:05.76]How much time do I have?
[332:06.34]1 minute 20.
[332:09.34]1 minute 20.
[332:10.00]Let's get the other... Let's get tomato going.
[332:14.76]These are already cooked.
[332:16.24]I'm going to remember that they're up here.
[332:18.33]Don't let me forget that.
[332:19.01]These are too cooked in case there's a salmon.
[332:30.57]Now it's 7.50 for a tomato.
[332:45.94]And then we need, how much salt?
[332:47.22]Is it 12 and 12?
[332:47.46]30 seconds.
[332:47.76]12 and 12, right?
[333:10.41]16 seconds, we're fine.
[333:14.91]Okay, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[333:17.19]Don't, Brandon.
[333:23.72]Okay, this is ready.
[333:30.92]Don't let me forget this is up here, because it's cooked and it's ready to eat.
[333:36.90]Okay, how are we doing?
[333:39.23]Perfect.
[333:39.85]Alright.
[333:41.39]Look at that.
[333:42.21]I got two minutes.
[333:52.59]Soup is done.
[333:54.03]Everything's cooked.
[333:55.77]Beautiful.
[333:56.23]Alright.
[333:56.51]I got two minutes here.
[333:58.35]I know.
[333:58.89]I need to.
[334:02.21]Um, let me tell you.
[334:05.09]It's tomatoes, right?
[334:07.01]One, two, three, four, five.
[334:11.37]Let me tell you something, Larry.
[334:13.53]Oh, I think that you're not very nice to my wife.
[334:17.28]You understand?
[334:20.24]God damn it.
[334:20.70]Onion.
[334:23.32]Onion.
[334:29.91]And that's it, right?
[334:30.59]And then cook, and then you add, and then you mash it up.
[334:32.55]60 seconds, right?
[334:33.35]Is this right?
[334:37.55]Is it eight tomatoes?
[334:42.77]Eight?
[334:46.59]Eight fucking tomatoes!
[334:47.86]Alright, get it on the burner, go.
[334:49.70]Turn this off.
[334:50.80]60 seconds, and then we start mashing.
[334:52.96]Alright, how, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[334:54.46]Okay, bowls, bowls, bowls, I need bowls.
[335:06.89]No, no, idiot.
[335:08.44]Where is it?
[335:13.54]You fucking dumbass!
[335:17.44]I'm so pissed off right now.
[335:19.71]I'm so angry.
[335:22.83]Oh, I'm so... I'm uncontrollably fucking upset.
[335:30.05]Oh my god!
[335:31.03]No!
[335:38.63]I need to pause it because I'm laughing.
[335:41.40]I gotta fucking stop.
[335:47.28]Oh, this is the perfect plan too.
[335:48.58]I just am like ADHD psycho man.
[335:52.34]Slow down.
[335:55.66]It's okay.
[335:56.14]Alright.
[336:12.88]Okay, F4.
[336:16.80]Oh, shit.
[336:25.33]Oh, no!
[336:25.75]It's still on!
[336:28.39]The stove is... The place is gonna be on fire!
[336:34.07]Oh, no!
[336:39.83]Why would they just, like, shove you out?
[336:42.82]It's not like a fucking dance club where at like 2 a.m.
[336:45.78]they like turn the lights on.
[336:46.72]It's like, everybody get the fuck out of here.
[336:49.14]Out, out, out.
[336:50.86]I can spend an extra two minutes there.
[336:56.96]Check dishes score before serving it to a guest.
[336:59.40]No.
[337:05.06]Learn the temperature.
[337:13.76]We need some taste.
[337:15.52]The one that tastes tolerance right here.
[337:21.78]Duration of the cleaning phase is extended.
[337:23.74]Yep.
[337:25.68]New recipe.
[337:26.98]You bet your ass we're doing a soup.
[337:29.74]Gazpacho.
[337:37.85]And that's a cold soup, so... French fries, though.
[337:43.03]Steak and french fries.
[337:53.17]But this is elaborate and it's going to ruin my soup... stuff.
[338:15.21]It's done.
[338:15.65]Okay.
[338:16.91]Now I need to add sour cream.
[338:25.85]Sour cream.
[338:33.51]150.
[338:37.90]Good enough.
[338:39.04]Done.
[338:41.10]Heat it up a little more.
[338:41.72]Heat it up.
[338:42.90]It needs to cook a little more.
[338:49.71]Good.
[338:50.73]Okay, I need plates.
[338:51.55]I gotta get this situated.
[338:52.65]How much time do I have?
[338:54.62]I have a lot of time.
[338:55.38]Okay, just slow down.
[338:56.30]I'm fine.
[339:01.40]Let me get this correct.
[339:03.16]Tomato soup is over here.
[339:04.38]It's the first one.
[339:07.88]I'm not gonna screw this up.
[339:25.20]That should be able to get me, like, four, maybe, I think.
[339:30.54]What are you feeding the rats?
[339:32.61]I'm putting out these plates to, like, whatever, I'm gonna, like, feed a bunch of fucking cats.
[339:39.25]Oh, you see, at my restaurant, I feed, like, 200 neighborhood fucking stray cats.
[339:47.71]Come on, kitties!
[339:53.13]Alright.
[339:54.13]I got five over here.
[339:56.38]I should be able to spread this thin enough.
[340:01.04]Just gotta be gentle.
[340:04.98]Yes, you like the tomato soup, don't you, sweetheart?
[340:09.00]Too much.
[340:10.45]Less than 200 in each one.
[340:17.25]That's a little bit more.
[340:21.19]Okay, good.
[340:27.72]Okay?
[340:29.56]Are you fucking kidding me?
[340:37.26]I can do even more.
[340:44.16]I think I can do one more.
[340:45.08]Yeah, I can do one more.
[340:46.31]Maybe even two more.
[340:58.04]Those of you that are wondering what the hell I'm doing, just... It's... It's plays.
[341:03.17]We call these big plays.
[341:06.13]Oops.
[341:10.99]Why?
[341:11.91]Because no matter what happens, I am guaranteed, because this game is strange, and even if this is here for three months, I will always get at least four stars.
[341:29.64]So I will never have to make tomato soup probably ever again.
[341:45.23]Perfect.
[341:48.45]Let's get started on that gazpacho.
[341:51.18]Hold on.
[341:52.86]I can spread this out a little.
[342:04.35]Alright.
[342:06.37]I have four... This is a carrot on the ground.
[342:12.71]Okay, now I got time to... I got a couple minutes here.
[342:25.15]What kind of summoning ritual is this?
[342:27.01]Stop.
[342:29.73]Don't make me laugh.
[342:41.73]I'm trying to summon Chef Boyardee.
[342:47.51]Alright.
[342:48.15]What's in here?
[342:48.87]Oh, wait!
[342:49.25]This is, um... That's broth for the... Hold on.
[342:53.96]That's broth for the duck.
[342:55.70]The game cannot handle this many things on the ground.
[343:08.89]This is duck broth.
[343:10.85]Don't let me forget that.
[343:13.35]I can do this like probably three or four times.
[343:14.99]We are preparing for the rest of the game.
[343:18.65]Y'all think I'm crazy.
[343:19.94]Everybody's like, what the fuck is wrong with this dude?
[343:23.20]I'm gaming the game.
[343:26.40]I have found the meta of Cooking Simulator.
[343:29.78]It's only pick soups, make them all, and have like 50 of them lying around and just get to the end of the game in less than four hours.
[343:48.33]Should we really get one more out of this?
[343:56.43]I can do another one.
[343:59.12]Give me another bowl.
[344:01.60]And then I'm going to start making gazpacho.
[344:12.33]This is making me uncomfortable.
[344:15.87]Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
[344:25.07]Alright.
[344:26.39]Tomato.
[344:27.37]Duck broth.
[344:29.18]Borscht.
[344:30.86]Let's clean up a little bit so this isn't disgusting.
[344:37.89]We're open.
[344:38.29]Okay, we're open.
[344:38.81]Open, open.
[344:39.65]I'm ready.
[344:40.35]It's gonna make...
[344:57.33]And I'm crazy.
[345:20.94]Tomato's the next one, right?
[345:42.75]I'm going too fast.
[345:44.03]The game can't keep up with me.
[345:48.89]It's okay.
[345:49.35]It's still good enough.
[345:59.54]Oh wait, I don't have that ready.
[346:01.38]How do I make that?
[346:03.24]Cucumber.
[346:04.22]Add to the food processor.
[346:05.68]Cucumber, tomato, red bell pepper, garlic, and bread.
[346:09.80]What?
[346:10.60]Add to the food... Give me the food processor.
[346:14.71]Cucumber, tomato.
[346:17.77]Cucumber.
[346:19.47]Tomato.
[346:21.25]How many?
[346:22.88]Cucumber.
[346:24.08]How many?
[346:25.08]I wasn't counting.
[346:27.02]How many tomatoes?
[346:27.54]360.
[346:30.00]What do I need?
[346:33.14]One more.
[346:36.06]And then red bell pepper.
[346:38.87]Why does it have to be in grams?
[346:40.81]Red bell pepper, garlic, and bread.
[346:42.47]480 red bell pepper.
[346:48.22]Why can't it just be two?
[346:52.52]Garlic and then bread.
[346:59.39]That bread looks horrible.
[347:01.13]I wouldn't want to eat that.
[347:01.91]Where's garlic?
[347:07.95]Are you serious?
[347:08.47]This is how you do this?
[347:26.47]bread blend add to the mixture olive oil wine vinegar salt and pepper 10 grams of their olive oil I need olive oil how much this when you put in there 30 milliliter
[347:58.72]30... I can't even tell where I am.
[348:01.42]That's close enough.
[348:09.89]30 milliliter.
[348:12.27]And then 30 milliliter wine... No, wine vinegar.
[348:17.61]What do I get?
[348:17.99]Oh, over here.
[348:20.35]Wine vinegar.
[348:29.76]Oops, it's okay.
[348:31.34]Okay, and then... Salt and pepper.
[348:42.99]How much was it?
[348:46.93]Was it ten?
[348:50.61]Okay, and then pepper.
[349:01.42]Where's my pepper?
[349:10.98]Ten of this.
[349:15.65]I thought for- I don't know why, I just thought this was a food poisoning container.
[349:18.35]I was like, okay.
[349:19.85]I didn't say it.
[349:26.68]Alright, then pour the liquid into a deep pot.
[349:30.12]And then I'd garnish with 8 grams of chives.
[349:32.20]You got it.
[349:33.90]A new soup.
[349:37.72]I think I can get like 4 or 5 out of this.
[349:39.52]Let's try to get 5.
[349:46.31]So 300, right?
[349:55.03]into a deep plate and then garnish with chives.
[350:03.00]It's a weird bowl.
[350:04.02]It's weird to pour this.
[350:20.58]Am I ashamed of myself?
[350:22.30]Why would I be ashamed of myself?
[350:40.07]Oh, that needs a little more.
[350:40.74]Alright, then garnish with 8 grams of... what was it?
[350:46.94]Chives?
[350:54.30]Alright.
[350:59.85]Gazpacho!
[351:06.85]You got another gazpacho for me?
[351:08.19]I'll do it again!
[351:15.25]Hey, look at that!
[351:17.34]Gazpacho, huh?
[351:24.66]Here, take your green bean soup.
[351:26.86]Take your fruit punch and green beans.
[351:37.11]Got anything else for me?
[351:38.62]I should probably make another one of these.
[351:43.53]Work faster on that order.
[351:45.01]Our guest is in a hurry.
[351:48.50]You came to the right place.
[351:55.26]Hey, how does eight seconds sound?
[352:08.08]You did okay, I guess.
[352:09.88]Way to be annoying.
[352:12.48]New order of
[352:17.04]It's the fish.
[352:17.84]Okay, do I have one of those already?
[352:19.40]I just need a lemon.
[352:22.76]No, I got duck.
[352:24.14]In fact, I'm going to cut this duck in half.
[352:29.27]And then store it over here.
[352:54.16]Okay, why not?
[352:54.76]I need, uh, fish.
[352:58.66]One trout.
[353:04.65]That's fucking broken.
[353:05.45]I gotta get that fixed.
[353:06.15]Remind me to do that.
[353:06.77]I gotta actually use the damn oven.
[353:09.51]Alright, it's five, five, five of thyme, pepper, and dill.
[353:23.22]Thyme!
[353:25.95]Pepper and dill.
[353:26.49]Where's the pepper?
[353:33.49]Over here.
[353:37.42]Aha!
[353:40.22]Yeah, why would you order fish here?
[353:43.04]If you knew that they were storing soup on the ground, where the fuck do you think they would be putting their fish?
[353:51.59]That's a no order.
[353:53.61]That is a do not order.
[353:57.03]Let me steal the potatoes over here.
[354:08.56]Get that in the oven.
[354:09.26]Alright, good.
[354:13.82]Here it goes.
[354:15.04]Then we need the lemon cut into squares.
[354:23.37]Let me see if I can get away with this.
[354:25.01]I'm just curious.
[354:25.69]I'm just curious, guys.
[354:52.27]That's pretty beautiful Let me do it this way It's gonna be like lemon sprinkles Diced lemon with the skin on
[355:27.40]The game doesn't like me.
[355:29.12]Sorry, I tried.
[355:59.22]Lemon wedge.
[356:01.62]Lemon wedge.
[356:07.21]I need all the lemon on here, don't I?
[356:08.63]Yeah, I do.
[356:09.11]Alright, let me get the horseradish on here.
[356:11.25]The horseradish.
[356:24.84]New order coming in.
[356:27.90]I'm gonna need... Actually, that was a lot.
[356:34.25]That looks better than the other one.
[356:35.75]On the left, at least.
[356:36.47]Looks like pineapple slices.
[356:40.03]Alright, I got... I think I got one of those ready.
[356:46.14]What was the matter?
[356:48.10]I didn't like your cutting technique with lemons.
[356:49.52]I'm gonna sneeze.
[357:07.41]Okay, I'm good.
[357:09.43]So, we got, um, this is already cooked.

[358:21.38]It's in the sun.
[358:22.06]It'll be fine.
[358:28.10]Okay, uh, duck breast.
[358:47.78]42 seconds to make duck.
[358:50.84]People love this food.
[358:52.70]Am I going to say that you're wrong for loving this food?
[358:56.27]What do you want me to do?
[358:58.35]Tell you, oh, no, that's wrong.
[358:59.57]It's not good.
[359:00.83]What's that?
[359:01.65]Oh, I got that right here.
[359:11.97]I'm making so much money.
[359:18.35]Alright, I gotta make a- I have to cook- I have to cook food, though.
[359:21.45]Unfortunately.
[359:22.26]I know, right?
[359:22.80]Pfft.
[359:23.82]Dumb.
[359:29.03]Where did that go?
[359:43.17]Alright.
[359:43.63]Can you not... No more orders.
[359:45.94]If it's gazpacho, then I'm gonna improvise.
[359:49.32]Where's that pork chop?
[359:51.84]It's fucking gazpacho.
[359:53.60]Not good.
[359:55.04]Not good.
[359:56.86]Not good.
[359:59.98]That's not one of my pre-made soups.
[360:02.57]Alright, what was it?
[360:03.19]I have to... Alright, alright, alright.
[360:05.53]Get this.
[360:06.27]Alright, hold on.
[360:07.63]I'm gonna make the... I'm gonna make the soup first.
[360:19.45]Let's just get this settled.
[360:26.79]That's fine.
[360:27.41]Okay.
[360:27.91]Soup first.
[360:29.13]That is... We need cucumber, tomato... Where's the... Where is it?
[360:39.68]I'm just gonna... I'm gonna guess.
[360:40.64]I don't care.
[360:41.46]It's two cucumbers, three tomatoes.
[360:46.67]It's a loaf of bread.
[360:49.94]Some bell peppers.
[360:53.44]And then garlic.
[360:57.37]It doesn't matter.
[360:58.85]How many bell peppers have we got?
[360:59.87]Yep.
[361:01.93]Yep.
[361:02.37]Yep.
[361:02.95]Yep.
[361:09.08]Get it off.
[361:10.58]30 of each.
[361:23.58]Ten salt, ten pepper.
[361:31.33]I just tried to hold down shift to sprint over here.
[361:37.31]Where's the fucking pepper?
[361:40.60]What do I do with the pepper?
[361:41.24]It's right here?
[361:41.56]Right here.
[361:52.26]Done.
[361:59.59]Yep.
[362:00.11]Okay.
[362:17.61]Why does this look wrong?
[362:18.57]This looks light.
[362:25.79]The color is off.
[362:26.49]Why?
[362:34.53]It's fine.
[362:34.91]Alright.
[362:35.13]You know what I'm going to do?
[362:35.79]I'm just going to leave this here.
[362:36.51]I don't want plates all over the ground.
[362:43.97]Oh, god damn it.
[362:44.89]What the fuck have I done?
[362:54.34]Fucking ding.
[362:56.08]I turned to pick it up.
[363:03.52]This thing's so sloppy.
[363:04.86]It's like the... It's a slug.
[363:08.57]Where's the pork chop?
[363:13.19]I don't care.
[363:13.61]It can be... That's fine.
[363:14.95]Salmon.
[363:51.55]Alright, there we go.
[363:52.19]Let's go back.
[364:05.14]Why don't I have two pans?
[364:31.52]He really did forget about the Doom OST.
[364:35.56]I'm addicted to soups, okay?
[364:37.86]Once I'm not addicted to soups anymore.
[364:39.24]Let me clean this up.
[364:53.41]Any more dirt?
[364:54.63]I'm over here.
[365:06.60]Okay, that's fine.
[365:14.73]Why is this not cooking?
[365:20.39]Cook, what the fuck are you doing?
[365:21.29]Alright, uh, I need potatoes.
[365:24.32]Potato- I don't have any potatoes.
[365:41.08]Cut these up, put them in the oven.
[365:53.83]Wow!
[365:55.07]Wow!
[365:57.79]Whoa!
[365:58.23]Whoazers!
[366:00.01]Settle down.
[366:25.54]What is this doing?
[366:26.58]Alright.
[366:41.33]Finally, it's sizzling.
[366:42.37]I can hear it.
[366:52.73]Alright, I need... Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[366:56.23]I don't have enough time.
[366:57.53]Plate.
[367:03.85]Just cut off raw potatoes.
[367:07.79]What an insult.
[367:09.63]What a fucking insult.
[367:12.49]This is just an insult.
[367:16.73]Insulting.
[367:20.27]Did I lose points?
[367:21.69]A net zero, that's fine.
[367:33.36]It cooks when I take it out!
[367:36.24]Listen to this!
[367:39.10]What?!
[367:40.92]How does it cook when it's not in the pan?
[367:44.14]That makes no sense!
[367:47.08]There's nothing cooking!
[367:48.74]What's the sizzle?
[367:51.95]Oh my fucking god.
[367:53.07]It's the s- the s- the sizzle!
[367:55.03]Guys, the sizzle!
[367:55.85]The sizzle!
[367:58.35]Do you hear the sizzle?
[368:06.65]I'm losing my mind here.
[368:10.16]The sizzle's the pan on the left?
[368:24.12]Fucking damn it.
[368:25.25]I'm so flustered right now.
[368:26.67]Just... No, no, no, no, no.
[368:31.82]Just put the plate.
[368:34.82]We already ate potatoes too, right?
[368:36.17]Potatoes, potatoes.
[368:59.71]Fuck off!
[369:19.58]I can do that.
[369:36.69]We're going downhill.
[369:38.25]We're going downhill, boys.
[369:44.85]I did beat the system.
[369:45.94]I just went nuts for five seconds and ruined it.
[369:50.32]We're no longer taking orders.
[369:51.30]Finish what we started.
[369:52.22]Okay, that's seven minutes.
[369:57.04]That's plenty of time.
[370:10.01]Why can't I make my own menu?
[370:11.27]Just make a gazpacho right now.
[370:12.70]I'm already here.
[370:54.33]So.
[371:27.16]I'm turning sounds off in the game because of this.
[371:29.31]It's fucking with my head.
[371:38.94]Look at how much better this looks.
[371:39.90]Why does it look so much better?
[371:55.63]Okay, these are done.
[371:56.91]Except that when the order comes in, add the garnish.
[371:59.37]I have a ton of gazpacho.
[372:00.57]How much time do I have?
[372:01.73]Four minutes.
[372:02.07]That's enough time to do... How much tomato soup do I have?
[372:05.00]Plenty of tomato soup.
[372:06.08]Plenty of broth.
[372:07.24]I need to make another one of those.
[372:08.66]One of these.
[372:08.92]One of these things.
[372:09.74]One of those.
[372:10.02]One of those things.
[372:11.24]One of these.
[372:21.53]I forget what, uh, hold on, it's... I'm scratching my face.
[372:25.30]Um... What is it, one of these?
[372:27.24]Okay, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
[372:47.81]Alright, it's, um... It's Beats.
[372:50.08]Five Beats.
[372:54.20]And then it's, um... No, it's not a loaf of bread.
[372:57.88]Parsley, carrot.
[372:59.90]Onion.
[373:04.76]Go.
[373:07.94]Salt.
[373:10.47]Salt and pepper.
[373:11.09]Get it both over there.
[373:16.77]It's, uh... 20, right?
[373:35.32]Go.
[373:36.92]I got 2 minutes and 40 seconds to get some balls out.
[373:51.98]We're spreading this really, really, really thin.
[373:53.84]I'm talking like 140 per ball.
[373:55.12]No, it's gonna be like 150 per ball.
[374:04.49]Now let me clean up a little bit.
[374:05.89]I gotta repair some stuff.
[374:10.95]I got lots of money.
[374:15.97]No, what?
[374:17.99]Now turn the microwave off.
[374:25.86]The microwave's not even broken.
[374:31.30]What was I doing?
[374:31.74]Where's the phone?
[374:33.28]Oh my god, hurry up.
[374:38.27]Come on, Thor!
[374:39.19]Pull it!
[374:45.91]21 seconds?
[374:46.29]I need something quick.
[374:48.07]10 seconds.
[374:50.33]When this is done.
[374:53.33]Do this one first.
[374:55.77]Okay, that's good.
[374:59.27]Is there a parade outside?
[375:00.23]Why is everybody playing a tuba?
[375:06.14]One minute.
[375:17.61]This is done.
[375:17.99]Okay, get the phone out of here.
[375:26.14]This soup is done.
[375:26.90]Done.
[375:28.88]How much time?
[375:29.40]Time.
[375:31.20]Behind.
[375:34.51]Watch out.
[375:34.79]Behind.
[375:35.23]Behind.
[375:53.76]Got it.
[375:58.66]Okay, one of these is too full.
[376:00.24]This one, I'm going to put a little bit in here.
[376:05.54]Just a little.
[376:10.46]Good.
[376:12.34]These both look exactly the same.
[376:13.66]I'm going to fuck that up.
[376:14.36]It's okay.
[376:14.64]How much time?
[376:16.26]Okay, behind.
[376:16.96]Okay, clean up.
[376:18.64]No, I'm good.
[376:34.19]I ordered my soup like an hour ago.
[376:37.71]Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
[376:42.65]Let's see.
[376:43.11]How do I do my complete and total soup?
[376:47.90]Let's see.
[376:51.28]Is there like a bonus to soup percentage?
[376:53.76]Is there like a 30% more soup from soups?
[377:06.22]No.
[377:09.94]The XP boost, maybe?
[377:12.20]Or, probably the taste.
[377:13.38]Did I do that all the way?
[377:20.17]Thought those were diapers.
[377:24.97]No, the tolerance was all the way up.
[377:27.51]Duration of clean.
[377:28.23]I need more prep.
[377:39.42]And I need, like, more after time and before time.
[377:41.56]There we go.
[377:49.49]You lose less fame poised.
[377:51.67]That's good.
[377:53.91]None of these are soups.
[377:57.11]Which one of these is the easiest?
[377:58.43]Salmon with asparagus.
[377:59.65]Okay, I know how to do salmon already.
[378:09.41]Grilled beef chuck with baked potato.
[378:11.90]Or tuna.
[378:15.64]I'm going to collect that one because that's the one I would probably eat the most.
[378:20.96]Salmon is easy, but I saw tuna.
[378:26.68]Alright.
[378:28.86]I got six minutes.
[378:29.62]Here we go.
[378:29.92]More soup.
[378:30.32]Okay, I got one, two.
[378:31.38]How much more do I got?
[378:34.92]Simple borscht.
[378:35.44]That's soup of the day.
[378:37.10]You got it.
[378:48.46]I need, what do I need?
[378:49.22]What do I need?
[378:49.74]Come on, think.
[378:50.46]Use your brain.
[378:51.57]Stock.
[378:56.81]A thousand.
[379:02.09]The whole thing goes in here.
[379:06.33]Okay, done.
[379:08.03]Then we need salt and pepper.
[379:10.75]20 and 20.
[379:16.73]What's wrong?
[379:17.19]What's going on?
[379:19.69]It's empty!
[379:20.21]I thought the game was broken.
[379:27.76]Okay, here we go.
[379:45.58]Parsley.

[380:33.35]I got plenty of gazpacho, plenty of tomato.
[380:35.05]I need to get some meat prepared.
[380:36.87]Let's get the tuna out here.
[380:37.95]I don't know how to make tuna, though.

[380:39.63]I have potatoes.
[380:46.12]I need a pot.

[382:54.78]Two minutes till the restaurant opens.
[382:56.10]I need, I got my potatoes right here.
[382:59.50]I've got already cooked ones.
[383:00.66]I gotta fill this with water.

[384:04.09]Anything else?
[384:04.61]No counters, bills.
[384:05.51]Is that over there?
[384:15.90]Almost time.
[384:21.88]45 seconds.
[384:22.24]That's enough time for me to get these potatoes out.
[384:25.08]They still need a little bit more time.
[384:28.30]Get these in the oven.
[384:29.00]Get these ready to go.
[384:29.54]They need to be chopped up into thirds.
[384:37.97]Try to get them as close as I can.

[390:01.77]Cup gum up.
[390:02.51]Alright, I got oil.
[390:03.71]30.
[390:06.53]I don't know why that happened.
[390:12.34]The wind from the open window?
[390:13.70]It's the only thing I can think of.
[390:15.26]Pork chop.
[390:20.22]Let's get the seasoning right on this so I don't blow it completely.
[390:23.20]Salt, pepper, and thyme.
[390:35.03]Pepper is behind me.
[390:45.00]Go, hook it up.
[390:48.80]That is so annoying.
[390:51.65]No, don't do that.
[390:52.39]This is going to take a million years.
[390:56.61]I have no other orders, right?
[390:59.59]No.
[391:04.61]That's two orders fucking ruined.
[391:06.01]I'm pissed.
[391:08.83]Because of what?
[391:09.31]Like a gust of wind blew in here?
[391:10.57]And knocked a plate over?
[391:21.82]Gather the pieces onto a plate.
[391:23.08]Does that work?
[391:30.47]No, it doesn't work.
[391:33.70]Well, I need that played anyways.
[391:41.96]Fucking goddammit.
[391:47.21]It's okay.
[391:54.97]Can I delete the sticky notes?
[391:56.33]Why can I even click those?
[391:57.21]I've been in the game for like seven hours.
[391:59.87]Why can I click sticky notes still?
[392:15.41]Okay.
[392:16.39]Potatoes are there.
[392:17.55]Potatoes.
[392:17.95]Shit.
[392:30.70]Spatula.
[392:38.28]Anybody see it?
[392:44.19]I don't see it.
[393:05.22]We're good.
[393:10.60]A plate.
[393:17.71]Six potatoes.
[393:18.57]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[393:27.75]At least it's cooking.
[393:32.05]Smash all the soup as a joke and blow the last hour of time.
[393:37.47]No.
[393:39.67]I don't think I'm going to do that.
[393:46.53]Save and do it.
[393:47.83]Not yet.
[393:48.33]I'm in the zone right now.
[393:49.37]It's raw.
[394:03.14]Enjoy.
[394:03.42]I guess you like it a little underdone.
[394:12.52]Hour-long joke?
[394:14.85]No, I'm not going to do that.
[394:21.39]I need to make more duck broth.
[394:36.18]Mmm, it's about portion size, really.
[394:39.32]I need more portion size.
[394:40.84]I gotta make double.
[394:41.50]Gazpacho, eight.
[394:48.54]They don't like the fact that it's old, moldy, and potentially a week old.
[394:51.90]They just want more of it.
[394:57.27]See?
[394:59.93]Plus 12, nice.
[395:07.51]You got to have at least like 180 milliliters.
[395:11.59]This part.
[395:15.90]This is all my duck.
[395:16.48]I don't have any more.
[395:24.27]Hey!
[395:44.65]Hey, like seriously.
[395:47.11]Fish.
[396:03.46]I don't know where it is.
[396:16.10]Okay, this is fucking broken.
[396:20.82]Oh my god, this thing is fucked.
[396:22.75]This thing is beyond repair.
[396:24.29]It's haunted.
[396:24.77]I'm not using it.
[396:47.82]No, put it... I don't care.
[397:06.05]What do you want?
[397:09.49]Salmon steak and boil- I can do that.
[397:11.87]Salt and pepper.
[397:22.24]All three burners are just on, by the way.
[397:24.46]Get in there.
[397:47.87]Nice, okay, cook it up.
[397:49.63]These potato- What's in there?
[397:51.20]A trout?
[397:52.22]Okay, two boiled potatoes.
[398:15.03]What else?
[398:15.75]Trout.
[398:16.25]I need a lemon.
[398:17.53]How close is this?
[398:18.31]Almost done.
[398:19.63]I need a lemon.
[398:20.15]Cut it into quarters.
[398:34.62]Plate.
[398:39.31]Salmon.
[398:41.45]I need a spatula, I need a spatula, I need a spatula.
[398:44.14]Oh no, um... Got it.
[399:19.38]Horse rider.
[399:35.05]Order up, enjoy.
[399:37.63]Leave me a good review.
[399:39.51]Pretty good.
[400:03.23]Nice, perfect.
[400:06.35]Okay, uh, what do I, what's the next one?
[400:08.25]Uh, this one.
[400:11.17]I'm not screwing this one up again.
[400:12.48]I know that they want portion size.
[400:19.32]They want bigger portions.
[400:21.98]Two of these in a row?
[400:34.98]Well, after all, you didn't mess that o- what?
[400:38.74]Uh, it's a key lime pie.
[400:39.74]What's it- what is that, a cake?
[400:40.64]Okay, that's good.
[400:53.51]Uh, one of these is a gazpacho, right?
[401:07.61]Good.
[401:08.19]Get it on there.
[401:12.09]Tomato.
[401:12.65]No.
[401:13.13]Okay.
[401:13.51]Put it back.
[401:13.81]It's already done.
[401:17.26]Just pick that one up after.
[401:18.06]Tomato.
[401:19.48]It's back here.
[401:20.22]Good.
[401:23.30]They want portion size.
[401:24.21]Remember, that's important.
[401:29.29]That's too much.
[401:30.25]Spread it out.
[401:40.44]What a perfect 300 milliliters.
[401:53.72]Almost at feign level 3.
[401:55.93]What's up?
[401:56.27]What's the next one?
[402:13.97]$5 tip for a fucking soup.
[402:18.46]What's a C?
[402:19.52]I don't understand C. I lost a green bean.
[402:25.44]Hold on.
[402:25.80]Give me the green beans.
[402:47.90]I'm killing it right now.
[402:51.37]I'm- I'm killing it.
[402:52.75]I'm doing s- like, this is the best I think I've done in a game in like a week.
[402:57.85]Two tunas.
[402:58.59]What is- I've never done it before.
[403:00.93]And a fuck- oh no.
[403:02.09]Hold on.
[403:02.37]This is important.
[403:03.13]Uh, slow down.
[403:06.14]I'm gonna cheat.
[403:07.52]Take tuna, salt and pepper, 80 seconds a side, and a lemon slice.
[403:19.18]Uh, so it's one.
[403:21.68]We grill it for 80 seconds aside, so let me get two out.
[403:28.89]Tuna.
[403:36.44]Okay, salt and pepper, right?
[403:38.26]Salt and pepper.
[403:51.46]Get it on the grill.
[403:56.00]Any sides?
[403:56.98]Just a lemon into the little plateys.
[404:00.36]Okay, grill.
[404:11.07]80 seconds aside.
[404:13.43]Your time.
[404:20.29]I need anything else.
[404:21.87]Lemon.
[404:23.48]I need to cut a lemon 80 gram into 20 gram.
[404:26.26]I need to cut a lemon into fours.
[404:38.77]Any style?
[404:40.17]You're going to give me a style to do.
[404:42.29]Come on.
[405:10.23]Alright, that's done.
[405:11.49]And then transfer them onto the plate and garnish with 8 grams of oregano.
[405:16.16]I swear to fucking God, guys.
[405:21.86]This is spring-loaded.
[405:24.68]That was spring-loaded out of my hand.
[405:26.00]Flip them!
[405:31.97]Flip them!
[405:39.79]Okay, 80 more seconds.
[405:46.99]I need to find the other wedges.
[405:48.41]That's a potato.
[405:54.17]One lemon.
[405:58.02]There's one more hanging out right here.
[406:01.52]Why?
[406:07.20]Where the fuck is this other lemon that I just...
[406:10.12]They're getting free lemon.
[406:11.49]It's only fair.
[406:16.31]Wait, hold on.
[406:52.31]Almost done.
[406:54.33]Kill the heat.
[407:02.67]Uh, oregano twig.
[407:04.29]Eight.
[407:05.73]God damn it, it's scaring me.
[407:19.81]That's apparently the best I could have possibly done.
[407:21.79]I just leveled up.
[407:27.30]Stop.
[407:29.40]Plate.
[407:41.41]I got one more thing to do, right?
[407:47.99]Oh, that pork chop is gonna be so old.
[407:49.43]I'm gonna have to rush it.
[407:53.25]Time to wake up for school.
[408:03.07]Pork chop.
[408:04.31]Uh... Yeah, okay.
[408:05.77]We gotta go.
[408:22.55]Uh, I don't have time to season it.
[408:30.76]Yes, I do.
[408:31.16]I got time.
[408:31.80]I got time.
[408:32.78]I need, uh, salt and pepper.
[408:47.63]And then, uh, thyme.
[408:48.65]Thyme, thyme, thyme, thyme.
[408:49.67]Six.
[408:59.03]Come on, Gwen!
[409:02.33]That's it.
[409:03.75]Start cleaning.
[409:08.85]Are these cooked?
[409:10.01]These are cooked, right?
[409:12.52]What are these?
[409:13.24]Yeah, they're cooked.
[409:14.46]They go in the cooked pile.
[409:27.83]Get the pot back up here.
[409:31.89]This is what?
[409:33.07]What is this?
[409:33.81]Timer?
[409:36.50]There's a sour cream still here.
[409:37.90]That's alright.
[409:38.70]Salt.
[409:40.80]Pepper.
[409:42.90]Still some... That's still alright.
[409:44.32]I can use it still.
[409:44.96]I need a spatula before I do the stupid thing again that I just did.
[409:54.37]Slip it.
[410:02.45]Trash.
[410:04.09]Alright, I'm gonna start to make trash.
[410:09.25]I still have... I need duck breast.
[410:12.11]Yeah, I gotta make more duck soup.
[410:17.16]Speaking of trash, I can't believe it.
[410:18.98]Give me a spatula.
[410:22.62]Give me a nice spatula.
[410:25.02]Is there a better one?
[410:34.41]Don't move, don't move, don't... What?
[410:50.76]Hold on, it's cooking over.
[411:01.40]This has been on the whole time?
[411:06.04]I just flipped it.
[411:07.22]I wanted to put a little sear on it.
[411:08.58]That's unbelievable.
[411:15.02]Alright.
[411:17.30]I need to clean the stove.
[411:20.24]Clean the stove.
[411:20.90]Is this done?
[411:22.68]Alright, I got my... My stomach fucking hurts.
[411:29.90]Six potatoes.
[411:35.35]Listen.
[411:39.74]When I said Tuba, everyone looked at me like I was crazy.
[411:47.13]You didn't hear it?
[411:47.69]Alright.
[412:01.14]The radio is supposed to be on.
[412:05.08]Yeah, the radio is on.
[412:11.21]This isn't working.
[412:30.04]Alright, alright, alright, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[412:31.90]Seven minutes.
[412:32.30]Okay, I've got to make more duck broth and gazpacho.
[412:38.96]Duck broth, expacio, and how am I doing on tomato?
[412:43.24]I gotta get three pots going at the same time here.
[412:45.42]And make them all at the same time.
[412:47.38]Forget about cleaning this stuff.
[412:48.14]I don't need to be clean.
[412:49.84]Big pot.
[412:52.06]Get all three pots up here so I can look.
[412:53.76]And I can get a good picture of it in my brain.
[412:59.39]Okay, how do I make the duck?
[413:04.81]These have all been cleaned out.
[413:05.73]Thank god I thought about that beforehand.
[413:10.38]Let's get a trio going at the same time.
[413:16.14]So I need to make... gazpacho, one more of these, and duck broth.
[413:22.77]And, no, I need to make tomato soup.
[413:23.87]I gotta make tomato.
[413:29.34]Um, okay.
[413:30.50]Gazpacho first.
[413:32.94]This is the only one I have memorized for no reason.
[413:38.37]This is arguably the most complicated one.
[413:39.95]Come on, get it in there.
[413:40.59]Come on!
[413:50.02]I have this... I don't have any of the other ones memorized.
[413:54.20]This is like two steps and a ton of ingredients.
[413:56.16]Why can I not get those other ones into memory?
[414:24.66]10, got it.
[414:34.00]Blend it up.
[414:36.29]Done.
[414:42.15]Okay, I'm gonna fill those two bowls and get three more.
[414:47.69]Is it possible to double the recipe?
[414:49.59]I'm not sure it would fit in there.
[414:52.33]I don't think it would all fit.
[415:01.69]Over 200 is fine.
[415:03.88]To like 20 to 250.
[415:04.68]Way too fucking much, but it's okay.
[415:13.46]Any more?
[415:14.60]Yeah, a little bit.
[415:16.07]Good.
[415:16.37]Alright.
[415:16.71]Now I can spread these out.
[415:17.93]This one can go over here.
[415:21.19]Just a hint.
[415:21.85]Just a hint.
[415:23.27]Okay.
[415:24.11]Up top.
[415:27.59]A hint.
[415:28.88]And then over here.
[415:29.90]Just a hint.
[415:32.46]Okay.
[415:35.02]Yee!
[415:36.10]Okay.
[415:36.80]Just spot you're done.
[415:42.00]Now, I got four minutes to do another dog food soup, whatever it is.
[415:52.52]And that is, I need a bunch of chicken broth.
[415:54.47]And I make tomato soup too, but I need tomato soup.
[415:56.93]Tomato soup, tomato soup, tomato soup.
[415:58.03]I need a bunch of chicken broth.
[416:00.47]I need a bunch of chicken broth.
[416:03.18]Way more than this.
[416:15.15]Oh, get it!
[416:17.49]One.
[416:18.79]Two.
[416:19.11]Uh, get three of them, just in case.
[416:21.39]I'm gonna need it probably later.
[416:22.17]Alright, this is a thousand, then 750.
[416:29.94]Come on, hurry up.
[416:31.64]What's that at?
[416:32.00]A little bit more.
[416:35.93]Good enough.
[416:38.39]The rest goes in here.
[416:39.99]Trash.
[416:43.17]750.
[416:44.93]What's the duck one?
[416:45.53]Anyone remember the duck?
[416:48.38]Come on.
[416:49.14]I'm going to need my Jermamites to come through here.
[416:51.00]715. 715.
[417:01.79]Was it a thousand... A thousand water?
[417:06.19]Or a thousand... It's a thousand water.
[417:08.32]Okay.
[417:13.04]What else was in it?
[417:13.60]I don't remember at all.
[417:18.99]You put the duck?
[417:20.19]What are you... Okay, hold on.
[417:21.21]Let's get this...
[417:32.05]And then I need parsley, carrot, onion.
[417:41.01]Go.
[417:41.67]Oh my god.
[417:42.29]What happened?
[417:42.65]We're good.
[417:46.03]Okay, now this is... Tomato soup is eight tomatoes.
[417:57.27]And an onion.
[418:01.49]Go.
[418:07.34]60 seconds, mash it up.
[418:08.90]And then the duck is... What is in the duck broth?
[418:15.11]I think it's a carrot or an onion.
[418:19.53]It's a carrot.
[418:21.11]It's 1300 water.
[418:30.08]Why is it not going up?
[418:32.78]Oh, you motherfucker.
[418:47.98]How we doing?
[418:48.32]How we looking?
[418:48.68]Alright, it's been 60 seconds.
[418:51.62]It's time to mash.
[418:52.48]Almost.
[418:55.43]Now what the fuck goes in here?
[418:58.41]Um, what goes in here?
[418:59.03]What goes in here?
[418:59.55]One carrot, one onion.
[419:02.09]One carrot, one onion.
[419:03.25]Uh, then the duck breasts also go in here.
[419:13.20]Let's make a few of them.
[419:18.07]Time.
[419:18.27]30 minutes.
[419:20.45]Behind.
[419:20.73]Okay.
[419:25.35]Good.
[419:25.65]Go.
[419:27.77]This is almost done.
[419:31.43]Oh, fuck.
[419:31.91]Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
[419:50.08]Put this down.
[419:52.74]No!
[419:59.72]I think everything's gonna be fine.
[420:09.33]I want more tips.
[420:12.65]No, I don't.
[420:13.07]Pull that back.
[420:13.51]What am I- I'm stupid.
[420:16.41]I want more thyme.
[420:18.54]Pork tenderloin with caramelized vegetables.
[420:20.28]Let's do the French fries.
[420:30.18]Please don't be on fire.
[420:31.30]Please don't be on fire.
[420:33.12]Please everything just be cooked.
[420:34.58]I turned off the burners.
[420:39.77]I turned the burners off, so we're good.
[420:43.72]People really like our grilled tuna steak, so it's our soup of the day.
[420:46.52]Oh, please.
[420:52.12]Who gives a shit?
[420:53.10]I'm done.
[420:54.46]It's done.
[420:55.04]This is done.
[420:56.34]This is done as well, right?
[420:57.92]Done.
[421:00.08]I'm good to go.
[421:00.52]How much time do I have?
[421:03.36]Plenty of time.
[421:03.82]Let's get this in bowls.
[421:07.07]Oh, none of these have been seasoned.
[421:08.15]Sorry, people get enough sodium in their damn life.
[421:23.01]Alright, I'm overfilling here.
[421:31.67]Two more?
[421:33.17]Three more, possibly?
[421:41.74]This should take us for another couple days.
[421:45.50]Yeah, I can spread this out too.
[421:47.34]I fucking spilled it like a dumbass.
[422:01.31]Do like 140.
[422:01.69]Alright, that's good.
[422:12.14]Don't breathe.
[422:15.86]Thank you for not breathing.
[422:17.80]Just saving right there.
[422:18.56]Alright, this doesn't have anything in it.
[422:20.76]This has the spill in it.
[422:21.77]Alright, let's dump.
[422:23.19]I'm going to put tomato in here.
[422:32.15]Tomato's done.
[422:33.05]Tomato goes over here.
[422:35.51]I'm gonna bring... I need to... Okay, get rid of these... I'm gonna clean this up.
[422:42.57]Yeah, you guys can breathe.
[422:43.13]Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
[422:44.89]I meant for like that one... like two seconds.
[423:05.65]Yeah, tell that to my lawyer.
[423:13.42]Yeah, I represent myself, by the way.
[423:14.96]I come with a clown suit on.
[423:18.20]I make the jury laugh, and then they're on my side.
[423:20.66]Sorry.
[423:21.93]That's kind of how it works.
[423:22.79]Alright, so I should be able to do three or four more tomatoes here.
[423:33.72]Don't crash.
[423:44.46]I bet you I can get one more played here.
[423:47.88]Holy shit, save the game.
[423:49.40]Wow.
[423:52.38]That would have been a disaster.
[424:04.08]I've been playing for seven hours?
[424:10.13]When did that happen?
[424:17.56]Okay, whatever.
[424:19.88]Sometimes you play a game.
[424:20.79]Let's fill these up.
[424:24.49]Tomato soup is precious.
[424:25.43]It's like gold.
[424:25.95]I don't want to waste it here.
[424:27.11]It's annoying to make.
[424:27.83]I just realized my posture was so bad.
[424:40.90]I just... Holy shit.
[424:42.52]I'm like sitting crooked.
[424:54.04]At least this is going to be hot.
[424:54.88]I could probably do another one.
[425:02.22]Yeah, I can do another plate.
[425:03.40]Actually, let's make this one a little.
[425:05.35]Let's top them off.
[425:13.81]Anyone look low?
[425:17.02]Alright, those are good.
[425:17.94]In fact, hold on.
[425:24.67]Okay, that's better.
[425:26.43]Spread this one down here.
[425:33.79]Better.
[425:34.17]Okay, these are all perfect.
[425:35.97]I would classify this as perfect.
[425:39.49]Now, duck.
[425:41.01]We have to cut the duck up.
[425:46.06]How much time?
[425:46.98]I still have- I'm still alright.
[425:49.58]Same thing I did the last time.
[425:53.88]In fact, I'm gonna cut it up really thin.
[426:12.82]This will last a fucking month.
[426:18.52]Yeah, this will last a long time.
[426:22.54]Did it not cut through the other one?
[426:24.26]No, it did.
[426:24.68]Okay.
[426:25.16]Give me a plate.
[426:32.69]Can I fit it all on here?
[426:37.81]I can.
[426:38.91]Easy.
[426:39.41]Slow, slow, slow, slow, slow.
[426:40.55]Slow down.
[426:40.95]Don't fall off.
[426:48.60]S. That's cooked.
[426:57.07]Alright.
[426:58.51]Now I get the broth.
[427:01.33]I'm going to keep the duck broth over... No, I'll step on it.
[427:05.09]Same place.
[427:05.45]Over here.
[427:21.07]Too many balls, the game's gonna crash.
[427:22.39]It's alright.
[427:29.65]How much time?
[427:30.43]Uh-oh.
[427:34.26]Alright, alright, okay, it's- it's- everything's fine.
[427:37.10]Here comes another- here comes another order coming in soon.
[427:40.66]Exactly what I was looking for.
[427:42.16]And I can take my time with this.
[427:45.60]I just made it.
[427:47.16]Oh, no.
[427:52.49]I've never made steak and french fries before.
[427:54.15]All I've done is floor soup.
[427:58.24]And tuna cakes.
[427:59.76]Alright, hold on.
[428:01.34]I need to duck broth.
[428:15.05]220.

[428:20.67]It's okay.
[428:21.69]I can transfer it.
[428:30.49]Alright, I'll just transfer out.
[428:31.63]Holy shit, you idiot.
[428:33.49]It's okay, I don't need the onions in there.
[428:37.49]Motherfucker, whatever.
[428:41.62]Uh-oh.
[428:45.00]Okay, we're good.
[428:48.72]Just gonna have to deal with the way it is.

[429:08.77]That's not raw.
[429:29.84]I mean, it's gross, but it's not raw.
[429:31.53]Alright, the next thing was the... This, which I never made before.

[430:04.39]Okay.
[430:07.89]Salt and pepper.

[430:33.61]I'm good to go.
[430:34.10]Let's clean this up.
[430:36.58]I mean, this is just filthy.
[430:40.46]This is a bad look on my stream.
[430:46.50]I'm serving all you guys all this delicious food.
[430:49.38]I don't want you to come in here and look at the stove and be like, what is this?
[430:51.93]This is disgusting, Jeremy.
[430:53.51]You're going to call me by my first name.
[430:54.49]We're on a first name basis at this point.
[431:02.24]Okay.
[431:06.74]So, steak, salt, and pepper.
[431:08.02]I didn't really prepare that.

[431:45.95]Like on here?
[431:46.93]Which one?
[431:49.83]On the flat top or on the pan?
[431:56.77]45 seconds is not a lot of time.
[432:04.34]What's next?
[432:05.92]Potato?

[450:52.09]Get both plates ready right here.
[450:55.65]I love this game.
[451:03.50]The first, the first like hour or two we ran into all those fucked up bugs was really annoying.
[451:08.57]But, it's kind of fun.
[451:11.91]Alright, I need the other uh... Alright, put the steaks on.
[451:19.25]Kill that heat in a second.
[451:29.09]They need to be perfect, I need my points back.
[451:44.93]Kill the heat.
[451:45.63]Kill the heat.
[451:46.19]Kill the heat.
[451:46.67]Kill the heat.
[451:47.23]Kill the heat.
[451:48.61]No.
[451:48.77]I don't know what that white stuff is.
[451:52.37]I didn't put it on.
[451:54.17]It's probably like fucking maggots.
[451:57.36]It's just squished bugs.
[452:00.38]Okay.
[452:01.26]Now it is oregano.
[452:08.50]First one going out.
[452:09.46]Give me nice points for this one.
[452:10.46]Five stars.
[452:12.60]I'll get five in the next one.
[452:16.53]I needed this bad... I'm only getting 5 points for this?
[452:20.73]Credit can walk in and drop my score by like... 70!
[452:22.55]That guy was an asshole.
[452:28.73]And just an absolute dick.
[452:38.60]It was 130 points.
[452:41.77]What a joke.
[452:43.27]Look at how long this... I was level 3.
[452:45.03]I was a 3 star restaurant.
[452:48.74]Alright, no more orders.
[452:50.68]I gotta clean this shit up.
[452:52.04]Like, actually clean.
[452:53.40]Let's repair.
[452:55.00]Clean.
[452:56.82]I've got plenty of soup.
[452:57.86]I've got plenty of food.
[452:58.76]I'm ready for the next day.
[452:59.90]I'm doing this.
[453:02.10]I'm getting this shit together.
[453:03.04]Can I get the phone back in here?
[453:19.73]Alright, how we doing?
[453:20.35]Give me the mop.
[453:21.31]Not yet.
[453:22.35]Get the stuff off the ground.
[453:24.61]Get a cleaner area.
[453:28.28]I'm not making any... I'm not prepping any food.
[453:29.84]I'm getting a clean area.
[453:32.12]For this stream.
[453:33.64]I mean, for this... Like, I'm streaming tomorrow in the game?
[453:36.56]What the hell am I talking about?
[453:37.54]Okay, these are clean...
[453:46.68]I gotta pick up... I need a plate.
[453:49.26]These can still be used.
[453:54.98]These potatoes can still be used.
[453:56.66]They really can.
[453:59.54]I can serve this to somebody.
[454:05.75]I can, and I will.
[454:08.39]That's just ready to go.
[454:09.09]It's done.
[454:22.68]I didn't do anything.
[454:23.64]I just placed the plate down on the counter.
[454:28.37]And it's made out of ectoplasm.
[454:58.90]That looks good.
[455:01.66]Place.
[455:03.22]Thank you.
[455:04.90]Now I got even more cleaning to do with this bullshit.
[455:06.80]Alright, I'm gonna move these to a better spot.
[455:14.89]Right next to the radiator.
[455:19.55]You know what?
[455:19.85]Put him on the windowsill, right?
[455:22.31]No, I don't think I can... No, I'm not risking that.
[455:34.02]Okay.
[455:35.40]Move these.
[455:36.78]This way, 10% I can get the mop in here.
[455:49.28]You- I- I didn't even move it!
[455:51.82]I need that stuff!
[455:53.29]I need that!
[455:57.69]It's like, so sloppy!
[455:59.41]The pain in the ass!
[456:06.34]Oh my god!
[456:07.44]It's like a- it's like a rubber band!
[456:19.14]This thing's made out of fucking jello.
[456:32.05]This is the floatiest mop I've ever used in my life.
[456:35.43]I really am on drugs using this thing.
[456:52.83]Can I stack the plates?
[456:57.35]Stack them.
[457:07.40]No, I gotta move all these.
[457:11.54]I can't believe I'm gonna have to remake the gazpacho.
[457:13.38]I'm so annoyed by that.
[457:14.48]I had two good gazpachos that are now wasted.
[457:23.80]How old is the floor soup?
[457:25.22]Some of them are at least six days.
[457:26.96]Probably five to six days for some of them.
[457:41.68]That's a little bit better.
[457:43.88]These can just kind of hang out here until I figure out what I want to do with them.
[457:49.61]That's fine to sit there.
[457:50.75]I'm going to mop that up.
[457:53.54]I have tomorrow in the morning, too.
[457:54.77]Alright, what about... Let's get this way, mop up over here.
[458:04.59]Alright, can I... Can I make a suggestion to the development team?
[458:17.81]I only have one suggestion.
[458:24.79]Patch out the guy driving by and holding the horn down.
[458:30.64]It doesn't need to be in here.
[458:33.60]It happens like every 20 to 30 seconds.
[458:47.41]That's my only complaint, is the guy driving by...
[459:12.50]One minute.
[459:18.36]Broken-ass plates everywhere.
[459:20.42]My kitchen's in disarray.
[459:23.94]Everything's just a mess.
[459:27.36]I used to be a fucking three-star chef.
[459:31.03]And then Larry came in, and, ah, this place, I don't like that food.
[459:35.85]You didn't salt the potatoes.
[459:37.23]And he ruined my reputation.
[459:44.01]How do I clean the oil?
[459:47.39]There we go.
[459:50.09]What is that?
[459:52.19]Is it a burnt potato?
[459:55.71]Shut up!
[460:04.72]It's gonna drive me crazy!
[460:16.82]This is really... Look at how dirty this is.
[460:18.24]I think I need a new counter.
[460:26.95]Is this just super caked on dirt?
[460:37.16]Oh, whatever.
[460:38.98]Yeah, that's fine.
[460:52.09]Alright, let's choose a perk.
[460:55.52]Unbreakable plates.
[460:57.98]Yep.
[460:59.42]You've seen it happen a million times.
[461:01.34]Now I want to do... Duration of cleaning is really important.
[461:14.05]I can now no longer break plates, which is, that's very, very good.
[461:21.00]You should get unspillable plates.
[461:26.00]Duck broth.
[461:26.60]I got plenty of it.
[461:30.34]Do not break any plates.
[461:31.30]Well, I can't.
[461:32.29]So, don't you worry about that.
[461:36.99]Okay.
[461:38.83]Speaking of... I still can't believe this happened.
[461:43.23]I'm just going to throw it away.
[461:48.73]That's perfectly good fish.
[461:51.35]try to break a plate nope we're good alright I'm gonna pick this up alright I have plenty of duck already made I'm not too concerned about this I just want to clean up the area
[462:31.72]Plastic bowl?
[462:34.74]Bucket.
[462:40.81]Why in the name of God did I not do this before?
[462:44.11]I'm picking up individual pieces.
[462:48.46]Can I throw the whole thing in the trash?
[463:24.78]Nevermind.
[463:35.60]I can't.
[463:36.06]I can't.
[463:36.58]I'm getting tired.
[463:37.46]I'm telling you.
[463:40.27]Alright, I'm too addicted to this game.
[463:43.05]I have to pull the plug here in a little bit.
[463:56.10]Not yet.
[463:57.20]Not yet.
[463:58.06]Once I go through my whole soup inventory, then yes.
[464:02.39]I'm still... I'm not done.
[464:04.25]Just know that it's coming soon.
[464:11.00]Alright, what was it?
[464:11.50]Soup of the day?
[464:12.58]What was it?
[464:12.90]Soup of the day was what?
[464:22.39]Clean this up.
[464:25.91]Duck.
[464:26.37]Right.
[464:26.93]Alright, I got plenty of the duck...
[464:35.83]I'm laughing residually over something that happened like an hour and 25 minutes ago.
[464:52.29]Psycho.
[464:58.31]Wasting food?
[464:58.97]No, this is dead.
[465:01.30]Alright.
[465:02.56]I am ready to begin.
[465:04.68]I've got some prep.
[465:06.26]I've got plenty of stuff.
[465:07.28]I've got my spatula.
[465:08.22]I've got my workstation cleaned.
[465:10.60]Everything is all set.
[465:12.96]I still have a couple... I still have a few minutes.
[465:16.38]Maybe it's worth it to me to get some prep here.
[465:18.22]Maybe some tuna steaks.
[465:23.83]Some salmon.
[465:24.83]A steak.
[465:31.50]Actually, I don't need more than one duck.
[465:35.92]I'm going to pre-make french fries.
[465:38.10]No, I'll be fine.
[465:41.42]I'm probably going to need some more duck broth.
[465:45.57]Which is very easy to make, and I can do that in less than a minute.
[465:49.59]Let's just make it just in case customers want to have an extra little bit here.
[465:54.99]They can get some extra chicken.
[465:58.07]Duck, whatever the hell it is.
[466:00.03]Okay, so water.
[466:02.70]1.3 liters of water.
[466:04.46]There's something in my eye.
[466:14.22]Okay, then I need a carrot, a onion,
[466:25.87]And that's it, right?
[466:27.93]Carrot and onion.
[466:30.09]And then salt.
[466:36.05]Is it 10?
[466:43.55]Carrot, onion, salt, and then put the ducks in there.
[466:46.35]And that should be good.
[466:55.14]Pepper, too.
[466:55.76]Oh, there is pepper in there.
[466:56.68]You're right.
[467:07.79]Let's get a broth going.
[467:11.97]I'm ready.
[467:15.83]Clean the sink.
[467:21.28]I thought somebody was just lying and just, like, baiting me to look in the sink, but that is bad.
[467:25.44]That's very, it's really bad.
[467:36.36]So that's how that works.
[467:38.38]When it works, it's great, isn't it?
[467:39.66]Let's get this in there.
[467:54.28]I can't get in there and clean?
[468:05.69]Pretty satisfying, I'm not gonna lie.
[468:08.49]Clean the sink, I'm cleaning, I'm doing it!
[468:12.51]Why is everybody spamming clean the sink?
[468:19.51]Fuck it.
[468:20.57]You want me to make like a prison wine soup?
[468:24.83]Alright, I'll make some prison wine.
[468:44.71]And I need... Can I even buy it?
[468:54.62]I don't think I've unlocked it.
[468:57.74]Do I have like grapes?
[469:01.71]No, I have beets.
[469:04.13]Okay.
[469:23.01]Some more wine vinegar in there.
[469:25.03]OK.
[469:54.13]Alright, that's good.
[469:56.98]That's nice and beat it up.
[470:00.04]So now, we sit this over here in the sun for like six weeks.
[470:08.20]What's first?
[470:09.66]Alright, steak with french fries.
[470:14.85]Oh!
[470:16.27]Look at that!
[470:25.83]I made this like three weeks ago.
[470:33.42]This would hurt somebody.
[470:36.64]That has been sitting there out for at least, it has to be like five days.
[470:42.92]Still good.
[470:46.88]What's next?
[470:50.66]Oh!
[470:58.47]You guys told me to make toilet wine and I forgot!
[471:02.17]Oh, whatever.
[471:03.27]It's still good.
[471:04.13]No, it's not.
[471:05.89]Add it to the toilet wine.
[471:23.44]What am I doing?
[471:25.46]Espacio!
[471:31.12]You know what that's turning into?
[471:35.10]That's every six-year-old's experiment.
[471:41.07]What are you doing over there?
[471:41.93]Science.
[471:43.95]Oh, okay.
[471:58.76]What are you making over there?
[472:00.44]Flour soup?
[472:02.27]Oh, I'm pretending to eat this.
[472:08.65]Delicious.
[472:09.57]Okay, good.
[472:19.59]I think I need one more piece, yeah.
[472:25.94]The customers are just people pretending to eat the food because I'm six years old.
[472:33.47]What's wrong here?
[472:37.21]Not enough pepper, not enough salt.
[472:38.87]Wrong amount of product.
[472:42.69]Wrong amount of... Am I giving too much or too little?
[472:44.80]I got that right here.
[472:50.67]Yeah, if you think about how fucked up of a situation this is, this is just, we're playing pretend right now.
[472:57.21]This is what goes through the head.
[472:58.79]This is what, when you're six, this is what you see.
[473:04.82]I'm in a restaurant right now, but I'm not.
[473:07.08]I'm not.
[473:07.52]I'm six.
[473:09.26]And I'm serving floor soup to people.
[473:13.95]And they're pretending to like it.
[473:19.31]This is what it's like.
[473:22.87]I'm having kind of a crisis right now.
[473:24.27]Alright, grilled steak.
[473:32.42]Alright, uh, salmon and potatoes?
[473:34.92]Let's do salmon.
[473:35.50]I have that ready.
[473:36.58]Salmon and broiled potatoes.
[473:42.18]It's just salt and pepper.
[473:43.00]That's easy.
[473:49.39]Save the sponge.
[473:56.19]No, you would... If this was real, I gotta pull this full circle.
[473:59.73]Okay.
[474:00.13]So, uh, welcome... You... You want... Grilled tuna steak.
[474:05.41]Coming right up.

[474:19.36]Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm.
[474:23.24]Mm-hmm-hmm.
[474:36.32]Would that be all for you today?
[474:38.05]We have to mash up the tomatoes.
[474:56.89]Make them really yummy.
[475:00.33]Mm-hmm.
[475:02.39]Yeah, yeah.
[475:04.12]Okay.
[475:07.30]Who ready to eat?

[475:22.96]Mmm.
[475:32.65]What else do you want?
[475:34.87]Okay, I'll do that too.
[475:38.27]Yes, I'll take a cheeseburger with extra peppers and onions, and I'll also take it with a side of french fries.
[475:46.41]Okay.
[476:05.07]Okay, he's coming, he's coming right up!
[476:09.13]Oh, is it a bird?
[476:15.20]A bird just flew by.
[476:16.08]It's a robin!
[476:18.92]Oh... Okay!
[476:25.43]Your food here, it's ready to eat.
[476:39.51]Ding!
[476:39.87]Order up!
[476:45.62]Mmm!
[476:48.12]Whoa!

[476:50.82]Yes.
[476:51.62]You- This is delicious!
[476:54.22]I know.
[476:55.40]It's the best food I think I've ever had in my life!
[476:57.80]Alright, I'm gonna get back to playing the game.
[477:10.25]Okay, I need to make... I have the potatoes.
[477:19.30]I think it's time to turn the stream off.
[477:32.91]I'm realizing what I'm turning into.
[477:35.29]And I actually am turning into like the experiment pretend to have a restaurant five-year-old thing.
[477:41.09]And it's been freaking me out for like 25 straight minutes.
[477:44.46]Alright, let me finish this day.
[477:48.40]Pork chops.
[477:54.02]I don't hear any more honking cars in the game.
[477:57.69]Yeah, I don't either.
[477:58.61]This is freaking me out.
[478:05.03]I'm gonna get to the end of the day.
[478:05.89]Why are there no soups?
[478:09.19]We have not... There's been nothing but one soup this whole time.
[478:14.25]Salt, pepper... It's salt, pepper, and, um... Whatever.
[478:18.80]Time?
[478:26.92]Lag.
[478:28.24]Lag.
[478:36.89]Oh, by the way, I also forgot about one very important thing.
[478:39.15]Alright, it's time to make more food.
[478:44.13]No, uh, it's not, we're not making more food.
[478:47.29]Yes.
[478:48.39]No, no, Jacob, Jacob, it's time for bed.

[479:30.01]It actually goes out the window.
[479:38.08]Did somebody scream at me?
[479:40.05]I just caused a car accident!
[480:08.31]My chest.
[480:12.99]You're good.
[480:13.85]Oh, now everyone's going to jail.
[480:15.19]Everyone's going to jail.
[480:18.55]Alright.
[480:19.09]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[480:20.29]That's going to be the end of the stream.
[480:22.91]People are talking out there.
[480:36.40]No, I...
[480:43.65]What's done?
[480:44.27]Oh, my chest.
[480:58.73]This game's actually killing me.
[481:02.73]Alright.
[481:06.21]Anybody want some free soup?
[481:08.75]Yes, I'll take one.
[481:09.49]Did it get out?
[481:36.58]Who wants one?
[481:38.88]I'm treating these like pies.
[481:42.06]Like I'm a clown.
[481:50.80]I got it saved.
[481:51.32]Don't worry.
[481:54.18]Alright.
[481:54.82]It's been eight hours.
[481:56.36]It's time to go.
[481:59.08]I can't break them.
[482:01.94]Okay.
[482:05.40]Get the mop.
[482:08.70]Yeah, once I start pretending to be a child, it's time to...

[483:09.81]I can't.
[483:10.85]I gotta get out of here, guys.
[483:12.64]I've gone fucking absolutely out of my mind.
[483:14.94]It's over.
[483:27.05]Serve the bread out the window?
[483:28.21]Oh my god.
[483:36.72]Alright.
[483:40.58]That's it.
[483:52.12]I gotta kill that audio.
[483:55.44]Oh my god.
[483:57.58]That was too much.
[484:03.99]So, I think I'm gonna play this again.
[484:08.12]I'm not done with my floor soup empire.
[484:13.36]But we're going to take a break from it because we actually might be able to play it again very soon because of E3.
[484:20.60]Because as of the Microsoft conference is the next time you'll see me live, which is Sunday.
[484:27.41]Sunday at 4 p.m.
[484:31.87]Eastern.
[484:32.79]So 1 p.m.
[484:33.41]Pacific.
[484:35.19]So I'll be live at 1 o'clock Eastern.
[484:38.69]Maybe like 12.30, just like to... But the reason why I might be able to play this is because isn't there a... There's like a two or three hour break between Microsoft and Bethesda, right?
[484:53.78]So during that break, I'll just play this and then we'll do the Bethesda conference.
[484:58.74]That makes sense, right?
[484:59.34]I don't know how long it is in between.
[485:02.38]Ahem.
[485:06.45]Why did I not light the kitchen on fire?
[485:08.59]I did earlier.
[485:09.15]Oh my goodness.
[485:14.18]It's a four hour break.
[485:15.16]That's perfect.
[485:19.20]So the next time you'll see me, you'll see me for the Microsoft conference.
[485:22.42]I'm going to go grab some food after pretending to make it poorly for eight hours.
[485:30.09]But this is great.
[485:32.73]I want to get at least another solid
[485:37.21]stream or two out of this because I feel like some of the later recipes might be fun to make thank you everybody for watching uh I'm gonna just take a quick break and go pee I'll come back we'll do the bits and the subs uh I'll see you on the at the Microsoft conference I'll be restreaming it if you feel like stopping by please do
[486:03.43]I'll see you very soon.
[486:04.47]And for those of you that are sticking around, see you in about two or three minutes.
[488:01.73]Alright, guys.
[488:04.39]Let's dial it back a little bit here.
[488:08.99]Let's go over here.
[488:19.18]Hey, look at that.
[488:19.88]Let's go back a long time ago.
[488:29.72]Eight.
[488:31.21]Hours ago, to be exact.
[488:33.77]We had $4.15 from Spicy Skeletor.
[488:38.31]Thank you.
[488:39.31]Spicy Skeletor.
[488:40.53]No message.
[488:40.97]Just $4.15.
[488:45.14]$5 from Shkall.
[488:47.94]Thank you, Shkall.
[488:48.50]And they say Doritos chip.
[488:52.50]Doritos.
[488:54.84]Sometimes I'm a fan of Doritos.
[488:56.76]Other times I'm not.
[488:58.46]Depends on what kind.
[489:01.93]I'm a nacho cheese guy, not a Cool Ranch guy.
[489:05.21]I will tell you.
[489:07.67]But thank you for the five dollars?
[489:09.37]Doritos.
[489:10.93]Hack it fast, thanks for five dollars!
[489:13.29]Buy an egg and microwave it until it explodes.
[489:17.05]That's a mess.
[489:18.11]Too messy.
[489:21.37]Too messy.
[489:24.61]But thank you.
[489:28.84]Thank you, hack it fast, for the five dollars.
[489:32.84]Thank you trust no one for the 250.
[489:34.73]Decided to come back with a video of you in some peculiar state.
[489:41.91]Peculiar state.
[489:42.87]This is Jerma the VR Madman.
[489:55.04]Why am I in a peculiar state, though?
[489:59.55]We're gonna have to investigate this one.
[490:00.87]Hold on.
[490:05.92]Let's get the, uh... Let's get it on screen so we can decide for ourselves.
[490:22.00]Okay, yeah.
[490:25.77]What do I become in virtual reality?
[490:31.95]Damn it!
[490:44.11]I got your back, I got your back!
[490:45.45]No, I got your back!
[490:50.92]Kirby, you're a sicko!
[490:53.60]You good?
[490:56.30]You good?
[490:56.70]I don't have a hand.
[490:57.94]Jesus Christ.
[491:01.53]What?
[491:04.57]Oh, that did so good.
[491:06.43]What?
[491:09.81]Good.
[491:10.39]Nice!
[491:12.26]It's crazy to make you drop the heaviest tears.
[491:14.88]That was a real dick move.
[491:43.54]Oh, come on.
[491:52.09]I'm just a normie boomer.
[491:55.13]That's me.
[491:59.91]That was really, really funny.
[492:01.05]Thank you.
[492:02.73]Here's the link for those of you who want to watch it on your own time.
[492:05.63]There it is.
[492:06.55]That was Trust No One.
[492:09.57]Resident funny video maker.
[492:13.36]Makes all kinds of funny shit all the time.
[492:17.66]Thank you so much for that, and thanks to 250.
[492:24.77]Thank you Burly Man Bob for the $15.
[492:29.71]Thank you.
[492:30.03]15 bucks.
[492:32.19]Dropped on the floor, five star meal.
[492:35.01]Something isn't adding up right.
[492:40.05]Yeah, but they don't know that.
[492:42.79]If you drop food on the floor and it tastes the same, the customer isn't going to know.
[492:51.05]If they do find out and they do know, the whole place shuts off forever.
[492:57.61]That's why, you know, the customer doesn't have a window.
[492:59.79]That's why I like open kitchen concepts in restaurants, because you can see if the guy blows his nose into your food.
[493:06.23]You know?
[493:06.61]If you hear, like, a big cough and you look up, who the fuck is that?
[493:10.89]Is that chef?
[493:12.19]No?
[493:12.51]Okay.
[493:12.81]Just making sure if that wasn't the chef.
[493:13.93]They're great concepts.
[493:23.28]But thank you, Burly Man Bob, for the $15.
[493:25.54]TalksRay, thanks for $11.
[493:30.21]As MLC_St3alth once said, these rats are burnt, they are crisp.
[493:34.59]Anyways, love your streams as always, to my heart.
[493:36.15]Thank you.
[493:41.01]MLC_St3alth was always, uh, always contributing really funny things and interesting lines during the old videos.
[493:50.96]And you see, I think he's doing pretty well, too.
[493:52.48]He's got, like, family and stuff.
[493:57.96]He's a good kid.
[493:58.94]He's a good kid.
[494:02.37]But thank you for the $11.
[494:08.45]Appreciate it.
[494:11.61]Oh, Muffin, thank you for the $7.
[494:17.73]They say, Dura, please let me go.
[494:18.92]I just want to see my wife again.
[494:20.28]Please.
[494:22.88]What?
[494:24.72]And then they say, Pride 100, Pride 100, Pride 100, Pride 100, Pride 100.
[494:26.56]This one's for my fellow LGBTs.
[494:33.68]Happy Pride Month.
[494:38.42]Thank you, OhMuffin.
[494:39.50]Appreciate it.
[494:40.43]Thank you for the $7.
[494:51.29]Thank you, AfroNinja, for the $5.
[494:54.68]No message, just $5.
[494:59.02]Thank you so much.
[495:02.49]FreudianWeapon250, no message, just $2.50, thank you so much.
[495:09.19]Much love to you.
[495:12.23]Espada Escar... Is it the fucking chef doing that?
[495:19.90]No, it's just a... ...normie boomer streamer.
[495:22.48]That's good, I can sit back down.
[495:25.36]Thank you Espada for the $2.50.
[495:28.65]Have you ever had Herr's cheddar horseradish chips?
[495:33.17]I have not.
[495:38.81]Are they good?
[495:41.32]I'll buy them the next time I'm at the grocery store.
[495:43.28]Are they available?
[495:43.88]Because that sounds pretty good.
[495:47.40]I love horseradish.
[495:52.48]I like it on sushi.
[495:54.52]Because that's what you're putting on your sushi, essentially.
[495:59.19]Most of the wasabi that you put on sushi is actually just green horseradish.
[496:03.43]I just ruined, I blew your mind right there, didn't I?
[496:13.34]Yeah.
[496:16.22]Not really.
[496:16.88]No, it is.
[496:22.66]Real wasabi is, yeah, it's pretty rare.
[496:25.60]They have it in some places.
[496:28.84]If you eat sushi at 7-Eleven?
[496:31.02]No, what?
[496:33.88]That's a thing.
[496:34.48]They don't even serve sushi at 7-Eleven.
[496:45.77]That's against the law at this point.
[496:48.83]You can't legally have sushi at 7-Eleven.
[496:54.83]They still do.
[496:57.26]No, no they don't.
[497:02.20]Has anyone ever bought sushi from 7-Eleven?
[497:04.67]And if you have, why?
[497:05.97]There had to have been a reason.
[497:07.49]You would dare to buy it.
[497:08.41]You lost a bet.
[497:10.55]Everyone that buys sushi from 7-Eleven lost a bet previously.
[497:17.70]That's how they make all their money.
[497:19.62]Is on lost bets.
[497:32.35]I have.
[497:32.69]I was hungry.
[497:33.47]I was still hungry after puking.
[497:34.99]Oh.
[497:35.95]That's too bad.
[497:46.79]I'm of the opinion, though, I might sound a little elitist here, but unless I see the person making the sushi, unless I order the sushi and they do it right now, right there, I'm not gonna eat it.
[498:01.19]Who knows, somebody could have like stuck another tag on it at like the grocery store.
[498:04.27]There's a grocery store sushi?
[498:05.55]Alright, maybe.
[498:07.15]But, if it's just sitting in a box... Hey, here's some salmon sushi!
[498:12.53]How long has it been there for?
[498:13.37]Has it been on the fucking ground in a bowl for more than four days?
[498:16.45]I know somebody that's done that, personally.
[498:19.73]Very much so, I know them very well.
[498:23.31]Who knows how long they could have been in there.
[498:25.63]Yes, they have standards.
[498:27.43]But I want to see the person... I want to order it and have it done and given to me in like less than an hour.
[498:39.82]Raw food?
[498:40.50]I don't mess around with raw food.
[498:44.27]I eat sushi.
[498:45.55]I really like sushi.
[498:47.45]But I don't mess around with raw food.
[498:49.98]Steak tartare, I won't even touch it.
[498:52.82]I won't even be in the same room.
[498:54.38]If you have steak tartare in a room, and you invite me over, I'm going to be like a vampire.
[498:59.54]I'm not going to be able to go in the room.
[499:02.03]It's going to be like Satan going into a church.
[499:04.33]My skin will start to burn.
[499:17.15]But, um, yeah.
[499:19.57]Sushi's great.
[499:21.45]I wonder what my favorite sushi roll is.
[499:25.04]Anybody know?
[499:29.34]Can somebody guess?
[499:32.38]Have I ever said it on stream?
[499:33.34]I don't think I have.
[499:35.24]It's not California roll, no.
[499:38.79]You got it.
[499:40.37]Somebody got it.
[499:42.73]I have two or three favorite rolls.
[499:47.03]Philadelphia roll is in my top three.
[499:49.93]Spicy tuna is probably number one.
[499:53.13]And number three is... I don't know.
[500:00.15]Debatable.
[500:01.66]It's out there somewhere.
[500:03.86]But spicy tuna is my favorite.
[500:06.10]Especially if they do spicy tuna with like avocado on it.
[500:11.16]It's so good.
[500:17.95]With, yeah, with flakes, tempura flakes.
[500:20.43]Now you're just making me want to get a spicy tuna roll.
[500:25.66]Uh, there's a sushi called Philadelphia Roll, yes.
[500:28.18]Philadelphia Roll is raw salmon and cream cheese rolled up with, um, usually what, cucumber in it too?
[500:39.71]Now, people that are going, whoa, that's gross, um, you know, uh, bagel locks.
[500:46.04]You never had, like, cream cheese lox and bagels before?
[500:48.66]It's kind of the same idea.
[500:53.88]You never had a bagel with lox and cream cheese on it?
[500:59.51]That's fantastic too, if you have never had it.
[501:05.67]Smoked salmon cream cheese, yeah, that's the same idea.
[501:08.63]It's just a sushi roll and the salmon is raw.
[501:16.69]In other words, the fish and spicy tuna isn't regulated.
[501:19.85]Quality and cut tuna doesn't have to fall under FDA quality control because it's minced meat mixed in sauce.
[501:27.70]Uh... What?
[501:41.00]Yeah, but when I go to, like, nice sushi places...
[501:45.23]You can like see them making it.
[501:48.45]They don't scoop it up like an ice cream scoop.
[501:53.55]I usually eat it... It's a sham.
[502:00.84]I've actually been to a place before that had sushi, and the spicy tuna was scooped up with an ice cream scoop.
[502:10.06]And I immediately was like, I'm gonna eat that, but I'm not gonna come back.
[502:17.29]I still ate it, and it was fine.
[502:20.77]Now that you say that... Yeah, they do a lot of ice cream scoop.
[502:28.35]Spicy tuna.
[502:30.28]Huh.
[502:33.42]Interesting.
[502:38.78]I'm not eating an egg ever again.
[502:42.84]Except from the places that I know do it right.
[502:51.25]I do like, like, simply this tuna sashimi.
[502:56.28]The nice dark, almost purple, fatty tuna.
[502:59.46]It's really good with wasabi on it.
[503:02.28]And that stuff's real because, I mean, it is.
[503:09.74]That doesn't come out of an ice cream scoop.
[503:17.63]You see the guy like... Two swords, two fucking big blades in his hands.
[503:26.80]And then he picks up the thing and he starts sliding, carving.
[503:31.78]Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, carve.
[503:33.06]Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut.
[503:34.00]And he puts it on the... Eat it.
[503:36.13]That shit's real.
[503:36.91]They don't make that up.
[503:37.71]That's not a stuffed animal.
[503:48.89]What if it is?
[503:50.75]But let's move on.
[503:54.93]I think we got them from Cheddar Horse Radish Chips.
[503:58.47]I will definitely try them.
[504:00.32]Hey, podcast listener, thanks for four bucks.
[504:02.14]Happy birthday.
[504:02.90]It's not my birthday.
[504:08.70]My birthday is not for a long time.
[504:12.57]Remind me in like another undetermined, indeterminate amount of time.
[504:17.67]But happy birthday to you if it's your birthday.
[504:19.30]What if it's maybe it's your birthday today?
[504:20.90]Happy birthday to anybody whose birthday it is.
[504:25.74]Thank you, podcast listener, for $4.
[504:27.18]Thank you, Tingy, for $2.50!
[504:29.42]Honestly, I don't know who's worse at this point, the honkers or the vroomers.
[504:34.60]Just be happy there are no actual honkers.
[504:41.36]I would have to, like, stream in a cement basement if that were the case.
[504:50.20]Thank you Waffle Monster for the ten bucks.
[504:53.18]Thank you Waffle Monster.
[504:56.00]Use me like you... Thank you for the ten dollars.
[505:03.66]I appreciate the ten bucks.
[505:09.95]That's a... And then they said something about the sponges and they called me dead.
[505:15.07]Thanks for the ten dollars.
[505:17.19]Uh, thank you, Shalashashka, for the $2.50.
[505:23.86]You're pretty good.
[505:24.94]Just what I'd expect from the man with the same house as Etalyx.
[505:28.09]It's been a long time since I had a good stream.
[505:30.51]But you're just getting warmed up.
[505:31.71]Ouch.
[505:33.39]What?
[505:34.01]My 250 bits.
[505:34.97]What's going on here?
[505:44.12]JermaLiedAboutTacoBell.
[505:46.23]Thank you for the... $7.50.
[505:47.35]$7.50.
[505:49.51]And they say, hey Jerma, I had the weirdest dream and you were in it.
[505:55.07]You keep having dreams about me.
[505:58.26]It's the same.
[505:59.90]Didn't you have like two dreams about me already?
[506:07.54]This is like, I think this is dream at least number two or three.
[506:13.68]You were a pirate captain, and I was a member of your crew.
[506:17.18]We were looking for the Infinity Stones, and we had followed a map to this one specific island.
[506:23.18]I immediately found all six under a rock, brought them to you, and asked you to put me in the rumble.
[506:32.75]You got super mad, and then I woke up.
[506:38.85]Thanks for the Infinity Stones.
[506:42.71]Can I be in the rumble?
[506:43.59]The hardest decisions take the strongest of all decisions.
[506:57.11]And then I fucking push you.
[507:02.45]Also, seriously, Wendy's, McDonald's, and Burger King, aren't you forgetting one taco-themed restaurant?
[507:06.07]Taco Bell has good hamburgers.
[507:07.39]Is it not a... No.
[507:09.76]If you're talking about hamburgers, burgers, actual burgers, we're talking about McDonald's, Wendy's, and Burger King.
[507:26.69]All these other places don't exist in the burger vast 10,000 restaurants.
[507:33.17]By the way, if you're wondering why I'm stopping and stuttering, I just reached behind myself and like,
[507:39.38]scratched my back and there's like there's like a scab back here why is there a scab back here I didn't I didn't get like what dude that's weird I'll examine that in the mirror later
[508:01.71]Was it like a fucking leech on me earlier?
[508:03.55]That's weird.
[508:05.19]It's confusing.
[508:06.69]Anyways, a Taco Bell is not a burger restaurant.
[508:09.56]It is a taco restaurant.
[508:10.62]Therefore, it is compared with other taco restaurants, which there are not very many fast food taco places.
[508:14.94]There are some.
[508:17.66]But I digress.
[508:19.37]And they say, put me in the rumble against the other Jerm of lied memes.
[508:24.21]There are too many.
[508:31.64]There are too many JermaLied usernames to fit on the screen.
[508:36.74]And no, this is just you trying to get in the rumble from- No, you're just trying to get in the rumble!
[508:43.36]We'll see.
[508:45.72]C4G, thanks for the 250.
[508:46.76]Hey Jerma!
[508:47.94]I set up a bot to count your plus twos and minus twos on this stream.
[508:53.03]Interesting.
[508:53.51]I'm probably gonna fall asleep before the stream ends, so you should be able to check your final score with chat.
[509:00.68]If you do... Hold on, really?
[509:06.55]What's the total?
[509:08.83]Does it work?
[509:15.44]I think it broke.
[509:16.04]That must have been too funny.
[509:18.20]That must have been so funny that it was too many pluses and it broke.
[509:26.64]uh they say if not then I've up my code terribly anyway good cooking good looking have fun with you soups well so I'm sorry that it may have gotten a little messed up somewhere along the road it said 264. so I'm I'm that's we're talking about like a starting at zero right
[509:57.46]So minusing two.
[509:59.14]So that's... That's pretty good.
[510:02.70]Must have been fun.
[510:10.12]Yeah, it's zero.
[510:13.38]Keep an eye on that one.
[510:16.45]That's an interesting bot.
[510:18.87]That's really interesting.
[510:20.15]I like that.
[510:21.29]Keep that.
[510:25.79]But that was C4G.
[510:26.73]Thank you.
[510:30.05]I keep so much of my stuff on the floor.
[510:30.93]I don't keep really anything on the floor as much as I keep it on the desk.
[510:32.73]I always have a really cluttered desk and a really clean floor.
[511:00.20]But thank you, Lethargic Ferret, for the $4.
[511:03.35]Zeitz, thank you for the $5.
[511:04.53]I can now understand why your family brought extra food to Thanksgiving and how you served them Campbell's soup.
[511:11.23]Omega Lull.
[511:14.57]Campbell's soup is good.
[511:16.20]Plus, it lasts like 500 years.
[511:19.12]You'll be laughing now, but you won't be laughing at the guy that has 100 cans of Campbell's tomato soup in his closet.
[511:28.91]He's ready for the zombie apocalypse, and you're not.
[511:35.21]Hey, Mad!
[511:35.93]Thanks for the... Mad47 for the $5.
[511:37.87]And here's some of the money I got from graduating.
[511:43.61]It's not much, but it's as much as I have now.
[511:46.12]I'll be happy to donate more as soon as I can get more.
[511:48.32]Have a great night.
[511:50.36]Congratulations.
[511:51.62]On graduating college.
[511:52.84]I mean, um... High school.
[511:55.76]I don't know.
[511:56.60]It's not specified.
[511:59.66]I got from graduating.
[512:02.18]Whatever one it was, if it was high school, if it was college, congratulations.
[512:08.20]High school, alright, high school.
[512:09.81]Congratulations.
[512:12.35]Time to turn the page, start the next chapter of your life.
[512:17.51]Take care of yourself.
[512:18.77]Wish you the best.
[512:23.86]Thank you for the five dollars as well.
[512:26.87]Uh, Arkin, thanks for $3.
[512:29.25]No idea, hey, hey, hey, no idea if you remember me at all, but I'm the guy who went on exchange from Finland to Australia.
[512:36.09]You want to know why I went?
[512:37.98]Oh, okay.
[512:39.30]Bit of an underwhelming answer, but it's run by my school.
[512:42.98]And I figured it'd be a worthwhile experience, considering I've never been overseas before.
[512:49.12]Anyway, I also wanted to let you know that you're one of the funniest people I know, and an inspiration to myself and many others.
[512:54.48]Keep it up, man.
[512:55.00]Appreciate you.
[512:56.45]That's still cool.
[512:58.21]You don't have to have some elaborate reason why you go and do things, right?
[513:02.43]That's just a good experience to do.
[513:04.03]That's awesome.
[513:04.61]You don't need to have some long story, right?
[513:08.77]It's cool either way.
[513:12.95]But I am floored that somebody sees me as an inspiration.
[513:20.04]I hope it's a good inspiration and not a bad one.
[513:24.64]But thank you so much for the three bucks and cool fucking trip.
[513:30.93]He must not know very many people.
[513:33.63]Ban that guy for five seconds.
[513:36.69]No, no, no.
[513:37.07]Double that.
[513:37.83]You're gonna double ban.
[513:38.97]Ten seconds.
[513:39.51]That's a double ban.
[513:40.45]I've never double life sentenced anybody before.
[513:53.10]But thank you.
[513:53.72]For real.
[513:55.95]Thank you potato chief For the five bucks Jerma.
[513:59.35]This is this chief of potatoes, and I have to admit I'm super disappointed But how you handled my soul namesake so I sent a rogue potato to destroy your soup Either one that crashed onto the plates when I wasn't looking I'll smell you I could smell you.
[514:15.32]I'll see you next time I
[514:22.41]Hey, Bingo Sunshine, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[514:24.29]Patented no spatula tuna flip.
[514:26.67]Gonna see if this works out first, though.
[514:29.27]God mode first, try double.
[514:38.83]Thank you for the $10, Bingo Sunshine.
[514:43.24]Hey, Uncle Joe, thanks for $2.50.
[514:45.28]Been having pretty bad anxiety from finals lately.
[514:48.24]Your streams always help me relax and laugh my ass off when I need it.
[514:51.56]Been a fan since 2013 and I know I can always count on you for a laugh.
[514:57.79]Thank you so much for the $2.50.
[515:02.15]And, yeah, finals, that... Everyone's pretty much done over the next week or two, right?
[515:11.69]There's usually between May 15th and June 20th, June 30th.
[515:18.98]Good luck to all of you.
[515:19.90]Hopefully you guys did alright on them.
[515:22.04]Don't stress out too much.
[515:25.58]Just do what you can.
[515:26.26]And, you know, try your best.
[515:33.81]Once it's over, you're gonna feel great.
[515:39.21]Let's get the credits on the screen.
[515:42.95]As always, thank you for the subs.
[515:46.21]The resubs, the new subs, the community subs.
[515:50.38]I appreciate every single one of them.
[515:54.90]It's good shit.
[515:55.74]Thank you guys.
[516:06.07]Yeah, good luck to everybody that still has them.
[516:07.55]If you still have a final...
[516:12.71]Study a little bit.
[516:13.73]Take a break.
[516:14.95]Grab some snacks.
[516:16.61]Study a little bit more.
[516:20.33]Get some good sleep.
[516:22.19]Because your brain has to comprehend that information.
[516:31.15]School in June?
[516:32.13]Yeah, there's still a lot of people that are not done for like another week.
[516:36.44]Or at least this week, right?
[516:41.16]How'd the colonoscopy go?
[516:42.20]Oh, for those of you that didn't hear about it... It went well.
[516:48.20]I... The doctors didn't have any major concerns.
[516:51.99]They took a few biopsies, which is why I spent an extra day or so away from the stream.
[516:58.91]And... Just kind of wanted to reassure myself of a few things.
[517:04.93]So the biopsies will come back in a couple weeks.
[517:08.28]And again, he doesn't have any major concerns, but it's always nice to know the results of those.
[517:13.73]But yeah, it went well.
[517:17.01]Was I the youngest person in the clinic?
[517:19.99]Um... Not that I... I don't really remember.
[517:25.11]I wasn't really paying that much attention to other people.
[517:27.08]I was kind of just... Remember, I hadn't really eaten solid food in almost two days.
[517:32.28]So I didn't really care who was in the clinic.
[517:37.24]I just wanted to get it over with.
[517:41.90]It was more about just focus and get in there and let me get out of here and be done.
[517:49.74]But no, it went well.
[517:52.48]A couple more bits came in here a little bit earlier.
[517:55.24]We had Ragarnoi for the $2 and I fucked that up!
[518:03.33]You cook- your cooking is like watching someone give birth directly to a woodchipper.
[518:07.19]Alright, that was worth reading.
[518:14.09]That was good.
[518:21.60]Thank you.
[518:22.90]For the bits there, regardless.
[518:27.07]Uh, ShortStack, thanks for $5.
[518:29.23]Been too busy to watch the streams lately, but Cooking Sim was such a fun game to come back to.
[518:33.67]Thanks for the laughs, King.
[518:36.38]I, I, I mean, I gotta address the fact that you just called me the King.
[518:40.00]I mean, King?
[518:41.84]Hey, I mean, hopefully I'm good to the people here.
[518:47.87]I appreciate it, though.
[518:48.51]Thank you for the $5.
[518:51.41]UnicornButtCrumbs, thanks for $2.50.
[518:55.18]Hey Jeremy, been watching you for about seven years now since the early days of YouTube.
[519:00.20]You never fail to put a smile on my face, buddy.
[519:02.56]I've been struggling a lot with SSRI withdrawals and your streams are a nice escape from my crazily imbalanced brain.
[519:10.65]Love all your content creating and passion for what you do.
[519:13.35]Got a question for you.
[519:15.17]Okay.
[519:16.05]Which fictional character has had the biggest impact on your life?
[519:21.16]fictional character that has had the biggest impact on my life?
[519:24.14]Um... Hmm... Hmm... Honestly?
[519:39.61]Probably... Probably Ren and Stimpy.
[519:47.88]If I'm completely and totally honest, because that like shaped...
[519:52.42]Everything about the way that I wanted to think was funny and the way that I was and... Imitation and... Ren and Stimpy.
[520:01.67]Both those two.
[520:04.13]Were just characters that... You only get to pick one.
[520:07.65]Ren.
[520:09.38]It's Ren.
[520:09.90]It's definitely not Stimpy.
[520:10.66]It's Ren.
[520:18.48]Always Ren.
[520:23.84]Snippy's cool, but Ren was the clear... clear anchor of the whole show.
[520:34.09]Ren was the little chihuahua.
[520:38.43]I mean, I guess a better... I mean, you say fictional character, but Billy West is not a fictional character.
[520:43.77]That's the person that did all the voices.
[520:46.23]Firenze, Stimpy, Doug.
[520:48.19]He did almost every voice on Futurama.
[520:50.11]Billy West is probably, like, the reason why I'm the kind of person that I am.
[520:53.85]Billy West, Jim Carrey.
[520:55.91]A couple other, probably, cartoon actors, probably.
[521:04.12]But yeah, Billy West was doing a majority of those characters when I was growing up.
[521:08.89]And he was so good.
[521:11.43]And he was so interesting.
[521:13.97]The way that he would put stuff together and the way that he would talk and how he would roll sentences together.
[521:18.23]It was fascinating.
[521:22.33]And probably Charlie Adler, too.
[521:25.66]If you want to know who Charlie Adler is.
[521:27.82]Ed Bighead.
[521:30.50]Satan from Cow and Chicken.
[521:33.42]Ickis from Ah, Real Monsters.
[521:38.67]Just so talented, just could do anything with his voice.
[521:41.99]He was just, he could go up, he could go down!
[521:44.29]He was so good.
[521:51.23]Yeah, like the ass devil guy, yeah.
[521:56.02]Yeah, I think he had an actual name, was he just Devil?
[522:07.61]But there you go.
[522:08.47]That's kind of a wordy answer there.
[522:14.05]I'm really sorry to hear about your having withdrawals here.
[522:20.56]And if I can be something fun or something interesting that you can relax to or have fun with,
[522:29.34]I say it a lot, but it's, that's great for me.
[522:32.32]That's great for this community.
[522:34.04]That means a lot to me.
[522:35.00]That's like, that's great for me to hear that.
[522:38.38]Because I would never want somebody to come and watch this channel and then say, that's, this is not good.
[522:44.84]This was, I didn't like that.
[522:46.06]This made me like uncomfortable.
[522:47.36]This made me feel like shit.
[522:48.80]I don't want you to like feel like shit after the stream.
[522:52.60]I don't want you to leave this stream
[522:56.13]Like mad or upset or angry or not having fun.
[522:58.93]You know I'm saying I don't want you to feel bad So knowing that if you feel you people tell me that they feel good That's a win for me like I feel great hearing that It wins not really the right word, but I mean maybe it is I
[523:23.34]Floor soup was uncomfortable.
[523:29.73]Yeah, and I know, like, honestly, like... We fuck around a lot on these streams.
[523:35.17]But it's to a point where we're... You know what I mean?
[523:39.67]I can't really put it into words.
[523:45.30]Floor soup made me uneasy.
[523:46.60]Yeah, but you didn't leave.
[523:48.08]Yeah.
[523:52.32]He's still here.
[523:55.33]Floor soup was pissing me off.
[523:56.79]It was... Hey, it's just soup on the floor.
[524:03.63]It's a clean floor.
[524:04.77]It doesn't... Where else was I gonna put it?
[524:12.77]I almost scra... Hey, I'm having a moment here, okay?
[524:15.77]I'm having a little moment here.
[524:17.23]I'm trying to, like, tell you.
[524:18.34]I don't care about you, sport.
[524:25.47]Anyways, that is going to be it.
[524:32.85]I will see you guys for the Microsoft conference.
[524:35.70]I'll probably be live 20-ish minutes before the conference so I can get set up and we can hang out.
[524:41.92]Remember last time I did this, I was like 10 minutes late and I was like in a bathrobe with wet hair from the shower.
[524:48.08]I'm going to try to avoid that this time.
[524:57.08]That is Sunday, let's see, E3 Microsoft.
[525:09.03]So that, it's at 4 p.m.
[525:10.59]Eastern.
[525:14.97]So let me get a good look here.
[525:17.97]I'm not doing the EA Play Live.
[525:19.81]I feel like that's not going to be anything worth covering.
[525:23.11]Microsoft is Sunday at 4 p.m.
[525:26.09]Eastern.
[525:27.13]So 1 p.m.
[525:27.87]Pacific.
[525:29.11]So like 12.30 Pacific on Sunday is when the stream is probably... I'd say between like 12 and 1 p.m.
[525:35.70]Pacific and stream will turn on.
[525:39.14]And then Bethesda is four hours later.
[525:43.89]So depending on how long the Microsoft conference goes, we'll play Kitchen Flipper for a couple hours or so.
[525:53.12]And then there's also... I probably won't do Devolver.
[525:58.58]Because I probably at that point would have been streaming for almost 10 hours.
[526:01.00]So I'll probably take off after the Bethesda conference.
[526:05.73]4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10... No, actually, never mind.
[526:11.61]I'm reading this wrong.
[526:12.27]Maybe not.
[526:17.08]We'll see how it goes.
[526:18.30]Because that would only be six hours or so.
[526:21.16]So yeah, we'll just play it by ear.
[526:23.38]Sunday, between 12 and 1 Pacific, the stream will turn on.
[526:27.68]We'll do the conferences and we'll hang out.
[526:30.40]And that's pretty much the next time you're going to see me.
[526:33.42]Have a great rest of your night.
[526:34.20]Take care, guys.
[526:34.90]Thanks for hanging out.
[526:35.52]Hope you enjoyed it.
[526:36.26]That game was fun and I had a lot of fun.
[526:38.54]Hope you did too.
[526:40.58]Take care, everybody.
[526:42.50]Have a great rest of your night.
[526:44.24]And have a good weekend too, because I won't see you until Sunday.
[526:48.34]Or, yes.
[526:50.14]Sunday.
[526:51.88]Good night.
[527:23.72]you
