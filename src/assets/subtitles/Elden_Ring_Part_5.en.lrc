[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.31]Hey.
[00:05.51]Hey.
[00:07.39]How are you doing?
[00:08.19]How are you doing?
[00:12.22]Good.
[00:14.30]Let me just make a tweet real quick.
[00:24.89]Hey, VOD watchers.
[00:26.43]What's up?
[00:30.51]Elden Ring.
[00:33.23]Alright.
[00:34.43]Screaming.
[00:38.32]I'm not going to scream today.
[00:39.20]I need to save my voice because we're going to go hard.
[00:43.54]I can't blow my voice out day one out of like two or three in a row.
[00:48.16]Like ten hours.
[00:48.85]You know what I mean?
[00:51.37]We have to be collected today.
[00:53.43]Tomorrow we can do whatever we can.
[00:54.53]I can be as loud as I want, right?
[01:03.87]Okay, how about Elden Ring, I'm ready.
[01:05.47]That sounds good.
[01:09.49]That's good.
[01:16.80]It kind of makes it sound like I'm just starting the game though, doesn't it?
[01:20.80]Oh well.
[01:21.08]Okay.
[01:25.66]Welcome back.
[01:26.14]It's been a few days.
[01:27.72]I definitely wanted to take a few days.
[01:30.74]I thought I was only going to need to take two days.
[01:34.03]But I got up on the third day.
[01:35.23]I was like, maybe I should just relax.
[01:40.21]Just go chill.
[01:41.57]Not scream or yell or tense my body up.
[01:45.40]Here's the thing about these games, right?
[01:48.34]When you play one of these games, you don't even realize you're doing it, but you are exercising your entire body.
[01:53.72]You are exercising your blood vessels, too.
[01:56.70]Everything.
[01:57.66]Every inch of your body is doing a lifting routine.
[02:02.29]Your stomach tightens up.
[02:03.39]Your arms tighten up.
[02:05.27]Your neck.
[02:06.21]Your jaw.
[02:08.96]Guys, I woke up like the third day and my teeth hurt.
[02:12.04]It was weird.
[02:12.60]It was like, wow, my teeth were exercised somehow.
[02:14.80]How?
[02:24.41]People think I'm fucking whatever.
[02:26.71]I'm just fucking kidding.
[02:30.05]All the grinding.
[02:31.07]Yeah, I don't know what happened, man.
[02:32.28]Like, my teeth got a workout.
[02:33.92]It's like, no, dude, you were clenching your throat.
[02:36.18]But we're going to keep playing.
[02:38.88]I know that people are going to... This is an Elden Ring channel, I know.
[02:43.80]But for the first time in about half a decade, there's a game that I think is really interesting, and I'm going to just play the hell out of it.
[02:51.90]I expect way more streams, right?
[02:53.84]Like I'm going to do three, four plus days in a row with this game.
[02:56.37]I do have to be careful because I don't want to go too crazy.
[02:59.71]I don't want to go too hard.
[03:01.45]So we'll see how I feel tonight.
[03:02.95]How long we go.
[03:03.59]We might go long today.
[03:04.84]Very long.
[03:06.66]Into the early evening hours probably.
[03:09.34]Early evening.
[03:09.88]I mean late evening.
[03:11.24]Early morning.
[03:14.50]We will, after this weekend, even if I don't, I don't plan on beating this game this weekend.
[03:20.72]Even if I go two, three hard kind of days in a row, or like one day, day off, three days or something, or two days, right?
[03:26.69]However I'm going to do it.
[03:28.37]Definitely not going to beat the game this weekend.
[03:30.25]So I got to figure out what I want to do content-wise with Elden Ring this
[03:36.29]Because, just because, there's no way I'm gonna beat it.
[03:39.10]So, does this just become a permanent game that happens every week or so?
[03:43.70]That you know there's just gonna be an Elden Ring stream that's just gonna happen as we progress through the game?
[03:49.81]And we just do other stuff too in the meantime?
[03:52.63]That's a possibility too.
[03:53.69]But as it stands right now, this is the plan.
[03:56.99]I'm still super into it.
[03:58.03]I have not played.
[04:00.27]I did make a new character.
[04:02.67]Because I wanted to play.
[04:04.11]But then I stepped back.
[04:05.63]Because that new character was way different than the character that I play on stream.
[04:10.32]I have about 12 minutes with a new character.
[04:13.84]And I just got... It's like a big two-handed swing pattern.
[04:16.78]I didn't want to get used to that.
[04:17.80]I want to just stay muscle memory with the guy that I have.
[04:21.26]Was it Astrologer?
[04:22.06]No, their name was Me Strong.
[04:25.08]They look like a caveman and they have a big club.
[04:29.45]That's one of my new characters I'm playing with off-stream.
[04:34.03]But yeah, let's keep going.
[04:35.53]This is what we're doing for the next couple days at least.
[04:42.75]I need to study, but I can't stop playing Elden Ring.
[04:46.39]Yeah, it'll be here though, and there's a lot.
[04:50.49]We also have to clean up the notes because the notes look like shit.
[04:53.09]And I also want to make it very, very clear before we get started.
[04:57.64]I got a big zit on my face.
[04:59.44]It's huge.
[05:00.12]It's going to be incredibly distracting for me.
[05:02.80]It's going to be so distracting for you.
[05:05.52]Just know that I shaved.
[05:07.96]And I had like a bunch of Elden Ring stress zits.
[05:11.76]So it looks awful.
[05:14.18]It looks really bad.
[05:14.88]Uh...
[05:18.97]I just need to get it out there, because the second I turn the camera on, all I'm gonna see is, in all capitals, SIT.
[05:25.92]So, I'm just getting in front of it, because, fuck it, you know what I mean?
[05:28.52]I'm in control now, right?
[05:29.74]Like, I am in control now.
[05:34.34]Yeah, I, I don't know, I'm getting the Elden Ring stress sits.
[05:39.27]Alright, hold on, it's almost time.
[05:43.73]Almost time.
[05:44.43]Hold on.
[05:51.50]Hold on.
[05:54.92]Wait a second.
[05:56.70]I'm really excited to play, though, because I have not played.
[05:59.84]I went in my character's inventory very briefly, just looked at stuff for a few minutes, but I have not walked away from the bonfire that I was at.
[06:09.59]I'm in that spot, and I can't hide it anymore.
[06:13.83]Can't hide it anymore.
[06:15.14]People are going to see my like freshly shaven zip face and whatever.
[06:19.08]It's okay.
[06:19.82]I'm okay with it.
[06:20.46]I'm not, I'm okay with it.
[06:22.36]I'm okay with it.
[06:38.65]It's a beauty mark.
[06:39.51]It's not a, it's a beauty mark.
[06:42.23]Somebody said, oh, fuck.
[06:43.71]It's naughty.
[06:44.25]Look, it's fine.
[06:49.77]And then, like, I made it so much worse, because, you know, you're in the mirror, like, what do I do?
[06:53.37]What do I do about it?
[06:54.49]And then you make it so much worse, it gets infected.
[06:56.21]I, like, accidentally shaved it off with a razor, and I was like, god damn it.
[07:00.93]And then when it was shaved off, I'm like, wait a minute, hold on.
[07:03.98]And now it's over.
[07:05.30]And now it's fine.
[07:12.33]This is- No, this is not herpes!
[07:14.19]What are you talking about?
[07:15.26]I don't have- This is not- What are you- What?
[07:18.56]Alright, time that person off for fucking 10 seconds.
[07:22.04]It's herpes.
[07:24.73]You're gonna- Now I'm gonna get angry.
[07:27.49]you sure you're 40 dude anybody can get I don't really get that many pieces of acne anymore but I'm sorry like these this is my cortisol levels while I've been playing Elden Ring have been like 100 100 so I mean of course but my cortisol level is increasing and my like I'm getting like very stressed and angry and it's always really sweaty in here and I shaved
[07:53.17]It's gonna happen.
[07:54.03]Like, even though... I don't even matter how old I am.
[07:57.29]By the way, you never ask somebody how old they are.
[08:00.79]Are you kidding me?
[08:01.35]Alright, here we go.
[08:09.28]We're gonna get started.
[08:10.18]Elden Ring.
[08:11.40]Part... Four?
[08:14.02]I don't even... I have no idea.
[08:15.56]Alright, let's load game.
[08:21.87]There's, uh, there's me strong, and I may have, I may have, okay, this says an hour, but that's not true.
[08:28.46]That's not true.
[08:29.24]Uh, I sat, I sat there, uh, testing to see if my, my laptop could handle the game.
[08:35.76]And I was doing, like, a temperature test, because my laptop, I don't think it can handle it.
[08:38.83]Because I was thinking, maybe I could play, like, in bed with my laptop.
[08:43.01]Uh, so I just kind of sat there and did, like, a temperature test to see if I could, like, even play the game.
[08:47.90]So, um, you're not, you guys are never gonna see me strong, by the way.
[08:52.77]There's no way.
[08:54.91]It's never gonna happen.
[08:56.31]That's the character that I play only off stream for me.
[09:00.11]You're not gonna get to see me strong.
[09:02.19]I'm really sorry.
[09:06.83]He's addicted.
[09:08.37]No, I was addicted to trying to find out if I could play it, but potentially, like, not in the bathroom.
[09:13.76]Alright, here we go.
[09:14.84]So we've got... What do we got?
[09:15.84]Turn it up a little bit.
[09:17.54]I can't really hear it.
[09:20.38]Why is his name Edgward?
[09:21.62]I don't know.
[09:22.30]Is it the first thing that somebody said?
[09:28.33]He's gatekeeping his character from us.
[09:31.37]No, that's my off-screen character.
[09:33.51]And I didn't want to play as him because the swing timings are so off that I would get used to, over the last two days, playing with me strong.
[09:42.41]And I would get on here and I would complain to you guys that I couldn't play right.
[09:47.86]It would be so annoying.
[09:49.12]It'd be like, no, but you don't understand.
[09:50.48]The swing timings on my other character are so different that that's why I got hit three times.
[09:54.14]I don't want to even give you guys the firepower for that.
[09:58.14]Alright, so the last thing to happen, I beat Loretta.
[10:01.00]I got this, which is really cool.
[10:03.22]For those of you that missed it, this is the Grape Bow.
[10:05.18]I'm really, really interested in how this is going to work.
[10:10.80]Because I feel like that's going to be cool.
[10:13.51]What's on your face?
[10:14.65]Yeah.
[10:16.01]Whatever.
[10:16.61]I knew it was going to happen.
[10:17.41]That's why I got in front of it.
[10:18.27]Do you understand?
[10:20.31]If I never said anything... It would just be like... It would just be like... Zit.
[10:27.91]I told you.
[10:28.61]And that person just came to the stream like five minutes ago.
[10:30.43]Alright, let's go.
[10:32.67]So last thing that I did, I beat Loretta.
[10:34.47]There's way more stuff going on here.
[10:36.83]So I didn't even look around this area.
[10:38.49]So let me look around.
[10:40.21]Don't listen to them.
[10:42.27]I'm not going to listen to them.
[10:46.09]Let's see what's over this way.
[10:47.11]I have been very itching and excited to play this.
[10:49.25]Okay, there's this.
[10:49.75]I can go up this way, which seems to lead out.
[10:54.13]Alright, hold on.
[10:56.19]Not yet.
[10:58.60]There's a place to go up here.
[11:00.92]Can we have a zit cam?
[11:03.12]You mean you want me to zoom in, crop this, and put it as big as the face cam and have it be the zit?
[11:14.01]No, I want new viewers to not, like, write threads about how fucking annoying I am.
[11:20.13]No, that's gross.
[11:21.01]That's just actually disgusting.
[11:25.82]That's actually gross.
[11:26.82]Like, that would be... If I saw somebody doing that, it'd be like, that's fucking... Okay, you're like trying... You're like trying to really put this like, oh, look at how gross and like weird we are.
[11:36.22]Like, no, that's fucking... I don't want to do that.
[11:38.78]Not happening.
[11:40.10]So what?
[11:40.34]There's nothing here?
[11:40.80]I thought there'd be something important here.
[11:48.04]I guess not.
[11:50.08]Big statue.
[11:57.50]Rub pizza on it and see how big it gets.
[12:00.46]Alright, well, we're going out here.
[12:07.34]Put a sensor bar on it.
[12:12.68]I move around too much.
[12:13.57]It's not going to happen.
[12:14.13]Okay, here we go.
[12:15.59]Three sisters.
[12:18.95]Three sisters.
[12:19.63]By the way, in case anybody thought there was a problem, I've got it.
[12:28.16]A lot of you just exhaled a sigh of relief.
[12:30.70]Of course I do.
[12:34.60]This is literally a giant dragon over there on the left.
[12:38.45]I'm going to go on the right.
[12:41.17]I have my horse.
[12:43.19]Frame dropped.
[12:46.86]What?
[13:09.97]Hmm.
[13:21.26]Okay.
[13:21.78]I think it's okay.
[13:25.72]I think we're okay.
[13:26.92]That may have been temporary.
[13:27.86]It might show up again.
[13:28.52]Remember, you need lip fillers.
[13:33.08]Actually, thanks for reminding me, but I don't know where it is.
[13:37.29]Frames aren't great.
[13:37.95]I don't know.
[13:38.39]That's weird.
[13:42.57]Sometimes, randomly, it seems like the last, like, few months.
[13:46.51]Once every, like, few weeks, we'll get, like, an F for, like, 40 minutes.
[13:50.41]And then it's fine.
[13:51.09]Permanently.
[13:51.89]It's weird.
[13:53.87]Okay, here we go.
[13:54.31]Uh, I wanna go around this edge.
[14:04.79]Is this actually the edge of the world, or is there more?
[14:06.39]There's more?
[14:09.99]All the way up here?
[14:12.37]No, there's not.
[14:12.95]Isn't this the edge of the world?
[14:25.10]Oh, hold on.
[14:33.20]You sound like people that are interviewed to replace you.
[14:38.93]Wait, you just distracted me!
[14:41.35]I said no yelling.
[14:42.07]Frozen armament?
[14:45.61]What is that?
[14:46.09]What is floating over us?
[14:50.11]Why is there like a spaceship floating above us?
[14:57.14]That was weird.
[14:57.62]You saw that?
[15:01.30]Alright, alright.
[15:01.90]Get off.
[15:02.12]Get off.
[15:11.06]I gotta check out Graveside.
[15:13.52]I gotta see what that item is.
[15:14.76]Frozen things.
[15:16.68]What level am I?
[15:17.56]I am... Oh shit, hold on.
[15:23.33]Are you dead?
[15:23.73]I am level 51. 51.
[15:31.17]Those of you that want to see what my loadout is, I will show it.
[15:34.01]Because there might be some new people here that just are dropping by for the first time.
[15:38.41]I got the Carrion Night Sword, which scales with Intelligence and Dexterity, which is exactly what I'm doing.
[15:43.65]I've got the Carrion Glintblade Staff, soon to be replaced with the Azure's Glintstone Staff.
[15:49.08]I'm not overleveled.
[15:54.14]Shot.
[15:56.02]Shot!
[15:56.34]You're 51, you look younger.
[16:00.70]I'm doing like a half and half kind of deck slash int weapon build.
[16:05.87]Very happy with it so far, and we're still going.
[16:08.39]Okay.
[16:15.96]Did somebody actually just say, again, shut up noob Saibot?
[16:32.02]Nobody said that.
[16:32.82]Who is saying this?
[16:34.02]I don't know.
[16:34.48]Guys, sometimes I have to fill in the blanks.
[16:36.83]I get shit sometimes because people go, dude, he like read half of a sentence and then just like made up the rest.
[16:41.97]Yeah, I did because like I can't read it that fast.
[16:44.61]So if you say in your message and I catch it and it's like, hey, dude, I am such a huge fan of Burger King.
[16:50.96]Like all I can see is the B-U-R.
[16:52.06]I'm going to be like, oh, Burger King.
[16:53.34]Like you're a huge fan of Burger King?
[16:54.34]Alright, man.
[16:55.78]Like that's cool, I guess.
[16:57.18]I'm going to fill it in.
[17:02.13]I want to see what that spell is.
[17:04.45]Frozen Armament.
[17:07.11]Enchant Armament's held in the right hand with Frost.
[17:11.40]Really?
[17:11.84]But I can't enchant this weapon.
[17:15.40]That's really cool, though.
[17:16.34]I kind of wish I could.
[17:17.08]Mm-hmm.
[17:25.15]Will you ever use your pouch?
[17:26.33]It's actually really super useful.
[17:27.91]Um, you mean like this here?
[17:29.99]Yeah, I gotta... I gotta figure that out.
[17:33.81]I gotta figure that out.
[17:34.51]Alright, so this is going this way, but I don't want to go this way.
[17:39.10]There seems to be a lot of stuff this way.
[17:40.98]I have 10,000 souls, first of all.
[17:42.10]Be careful.
[17:42.52]I don't want to die.
[17:43.20]I need more of this glove ward.
[17:52.44]Yes, exactly what I wanted.
[17:59.32]I need Glovewort II, which is exactly what I just got.
[18:01.70]Alright, this is going to lead to a whole new area.
[18:06.64]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[18:07.66]There was more to do in that area back here.
[18:11.62]Let me know.
[18:11.92]I don't want to get too overwhelmed.
[18:14.12]Don't overwhelm me.
[18:15.88]Stop overwhelming me.
[18:20.31]Still dropping frames.
[18:21.41]Is it still happening?
[18:23.73]It'll even out.
[18:24.65]It evened out last time.
[18:26.70]Last time there was an issue, it was at like 4 or 5 o'clock.
[18:30.28]And it resolved itself in like 30 minutes.
[18:32.72]So, it should be okay.
[18:33.50]So, this is where we are.
[18:39.19]I want to go back here.
[18:40.37]Because there's an area to go this way.
[18:43.19]Check it out.
[18:53.26]The zit and the shave makes you look like you're 20.
[19:06.83]Could you do a Garfield impression?
[19:08.64]Yeah, I think I could.
[19:10.08]I could try.
[19:11.24]Yeah.
[19:13.08]Maybe.
[19:13.30]That's the best you're going to get.
[19:17.88]Alright, this is where I want to be.
[19:21.78]Who am I in combat with?
[19:24.04]Okay.
[19:25.20]So, I want to go over here.
[19:27.72]Let's try here first because this looks pretty interesting.
[19:31.09]Let's go.
[19:38.38]Yep.
[19:40.92]Something in here.
[19:41.48]Can I have him go in here?
[19:45.98]Rena's Rise.
[19:48.02]Locked shut for now.
[19:50.76]What do you mean blocked shut for now?
[19:52.42]What?
[19:55.30]Okay.
[19:57.00]What about over here?
[19:58.83]Or over here?
[19:59.31]I want to check these.
[20:02.73]Rena's Rise.
[20:06.05]Frames?
[20:06.55]I don't know why it's happening.
[20:08.87]It doesn't make any sense.
[20:13.94]Okay, let's check these places.
[20:15.22]Actually, right, I gotta clean up the notepad.
[20:16.36]You're right.
[20:16.96]Let's do that first.
[20:19.44]These, I already did this.
[20:21.20]This was that area that I got the weird snake monster thing.
[20:26.00]I already did that.
[20:28.43]I already did that.
[20:30.70]Didn't do this Prawn guy.
[20:31.98]This Sea Offer thing, I did it already.
[20:34.14]This can stay, and this can stay.
[20:36.73]Alright, so... Rena... Rena's is closed for now.
[20:46.65]I guess.
[20:47.31]I don't know.
[20:49.97]Might be Twitch.
[20:50.63]I don't... No, it's not Twitch.
[20:51.59]This is definitely coming from my end.
[20:53.41]Alright, so that's... Rena's is closed for now, and I guess that's all I need to know.
[21:01.70]That's good.
[21:04.04]Let's go check out... Yeah, there's like a dragon over here.
[21:06.16]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[21:07.48]First of all, like this... I got so much shit on my map.
[21:11.61]Get rid of that.
[21:12.97]What the crap is on here?
[21:16.93]I don't want any more than that.
[21:21.54]How do I get rid of all markers?
[21:24.68]Four and five are the only... Okay, yeah.
[21:26.46]I don't want three anymore either.
[21:31.95]Alright, there's a dragon here.
[21:33.27]What am I supposed to do about this?
[21:34.55]Is it a dragon?
[21:41.09]It is.
[21:41.47]Okay, wait.
[21:42.27]I don't want to fight that right now.
[21:43.41]I have 10,000 souls.
[21:43.81]That would be a mistake.
[21:45.11]Stop being so rude about it.
[21:55.24]This is it.
[21:57.56]Yeah.
[21:59.02]Tell him.
[22:02.09]Are you going to beat every single boss?
[22:04.55]I don't think so, because I kind of want another playthrough to be able to have stuff that I haven't seen.
[22:08.99]Which is kind of interesting to me, so.
[22:11.35]I'm going to do the ones that I find.
[22:13.69]Well, the ones that I'm interested in, right?
[22:16.75]What is that?
[22:19.66]Ranni's Rise.
[22:22.64]Wait.
[22:24.36]Ranni?
[22:25.48]Rena?
[22:27.56]Oh, the Three Sisters.
[22:29.36]Okay, well this one's open.
[22:34.17]What the hell is this?
[22:40.60]Oh, someone's gonna be mad about that.
[22:43.20]Imagine somebody just wa- Okay, imagine I just wasn't here.
[22:45.94]Somebody walked into my streaming setup.
[22:48.58]And just took a two-handed greatsword and just crashed through the middle of it and then left.
[22:53.74]What the fuck?
[22:56.19]And they didn't take anything?
[22:57.15]So what is going on in here?
[23:13.21]I wonder if I... You probably have to fight the three sisters, right?
[23:17.55]I would be surprised if you didn't.
[23:18.83]Especially because there's a bonfire right here.
[23:26.38]Oh, I did my routine this morning, by the way.
[23:28.12]I did my Elden Ring routine.
[23:34.36]The Elden Ring routine was I got up...
[23:36.56]I took a nice, like, warm shower.
[23:39.87]I... I made a salad.
[23:42.09]And this salad, by the way, is very healthy.
[23:44.23]It's half spinach, half spring mix.
[23:46.95]And then just do a little bit of olive oil on that.
[23:48.89]Don't do anything else.
[23:50.33]Eat that.
[23:51.17]Let that just get inside you.
[23:52.67]Let that, like, kind of coagulate inside of your body.
[23:55.63]Get it good.
[23:56.67]Make a green tea.
[23:57.81]And here we are.
[23:59.77]Like, I am actually, like, I am full up.
[24:02.21]I'm ready to go.
[24:03.01]Like, that's how I play Elden Ring.
[24:04.51]I eat, like, a salad.
[24:07.11]There's absolutely a boss up here.
[24:08.23]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[24:09.63]I need to level up.
[24:14.85]Do I have enough to level up, though?
[24:16.54]Probably not.
[24:20.92]Is this it?
[24:23.94]How much is it for me to level up?
[24:24.90]16, 17, 1000?
[24:25.44]I don't want to die, like, five times.
[24:29.65]Alright, I can get that right now.
[24:36.14]Just give me a sec.
[24:37.14]Alright, I can come right back here.
[24:38.02]Makes me want to have some more green.
[24:42.54]Does that even count as a salad?
[24:44.44]Um, yeah.
[24:45.94]Of course it does.
[24:46.40]Alright, let me just get some souls.
[24:49.21]I don't want to go up here and die and lose 15k.
[24:51.53]It would be horrible.
[24:58.46]I have to fight the hand enemies again, which also, this is actually not a bad idea.
[25:01.41]I was like very, very tired when I got here and very annoyed.
[25:06.63]So I think now that I'm refreshed and ready to go, I want to explore a little bit here.
[25:10.11]There's this place with the hands.
[25:17.70]That actually scared the fucking shit out of me.
[25:19.38]That was the worst one so far of the whole game.
[25:23.60]I'm not kidding, that hurt.
[25:24.50]That actually hurt my body.
[25:37.74]Dammit, these enemies suck so bad.
[26:00.84]God, these guys are the worst.
[26:06.66]You get like, what was that?
[26:07.38]You get it like, what was that little like, is that, what is it?
[26:09.22]You know what I mean?
[26:09.70]How can you even tell what he's even doing?
[26:10.86]Alright, there we go.
[26:13.02]Finally.
[26:14.02]That was horrible.
[26:15.02]My whole, I hurt a lot.
[26:19.96]so this is yeah this is good because I can actually explore over here and not just be a dipshit don't alright fine no more huge ones attention streamer attention streamer circle behind the hands dude I have to get another flask upgrade I'm at plus one still I gotta get like a +2 or plus three

[27:08.01]Dude, it's easier said than done when they take up the whole fucking goddamn screen!
[27:15.25]Don't lose these.
[27:17.31]Oh my fucking god, these hands are the worst enemy in the whole game.
[27:21.43]Without a solitary doubt in my mind.
[27:25.97]Crystal bud?
[27:30.28]Eat shit, you hand fuck.
[27:36.58]You can't, you can't, like how, what the?
[27:39.46]These guys are fucking unbearable.
[27:48.12]I couldn't even get around him.
[27:49.40]His hitbox is this.
[27:51.66]He goes... Almost just dropped like a bunch of stuff.
[27:55.22]Alright.
[28:03.17]East fire?
[28:03.65]I don't have fire.
[28:04.67]I'm sorcery.
[28:07.83]Alright, go ahead and come out of the ground.
[28:09.29]You fucking piece of shit.
[28:18.53]Where is he?
[28:18.93]He's like right here.

[28:35.97]Okay.
[28:48.51]Thank you!
[29:03.20]Appreciate it.
[29:14.31]He's using the joke weapon?
[29:15.67]This is not... How is this a joke weapon?
[29:17.43]This thing's awesome.
[29:19.95]This is not a joke weapon.
[29:24.80]Joke weapon?
[29:28.92]These knight swords could serve as catalysts, letting them wield sorcerous battle skills.
[29:33.40]Despite numbering fewer than 20, this power made them a match for even the champions of golden battle.
[29:41.08]It's a joke weapon?
[29:42.91]Where's the comedy paragraph?
[29:47.25]This is a knight's sword for a carrion knight.
[29:53.88]There's no joke paragraph.
[29:55.06]Alright, I almost have enough.
[30:07.15]Where is he?
[30:07.49]He's a critter.
[30:11.14]Where are you?
[30:12.68]Ah.
[30:14.30]Oh.
[30:15.40]Hi.
[30:24.04]Hello.
[30:24.52]Turn around.
[30:26.96]Hey, hey, game.
[30:28.08]What the fuck was that?
[30:30.54]Why can't I walk onto this guy?
[30:31.94]What the fuck?
[30:33.92]What?
[30:48.39]There's so many fucking trees in the goddamn way.
[30:51.41]So many fucking rocks.
[30:52.45]Like, I come down here so I can actually fight your dumbass enemy.
[31:13.69]Dude, stop turning around so fucking fast!
[31:25.23]I hate these things.
[31:26.07]These things just make me angry.
[31:28.59]You know how you got that, like, one enemy in any of these Souls games that just, like, makes you remarkably fucking angry?
[31:33.94]Remarkably angry.
[31:34.94]Like, you can't stand being sitting in the seat when they show up.
[31:39.50]It's this guy.
[31:44.22]These big hands make me remarkably upset.
[31:47.73]Like, it's unbelievable how mad they make me.
[31:54.28]Okay, so let's see.
[31:56.19]What else did I not see over here?
[31:57.77]I swear to God, I didn't even see it.
[32:03.59]Alright, just run.
[32:06.03]Like, fuck this whole place.
[32:07.47]Like, seriously, I don't care.
[32:08.27]There could literally be a sorcery item that kills every boss in one hit literally over there.
[32:12.37]I don't even care.
[32:12.95]I don't want it.
[32:13.89]I don't want it.
[32:14.97]I don't want it.
[32:16.13]I don't want it.
[32:29.73]I will do this, though.
[32:36.10]I think it doesn't do that much damage.
[32:40.52]Oh, you bet your ass I'm going to sit here and do this.
[32:41.92]I need the souls.
[32:43.22]Oh.
[32:54.95]If he kills me, I'm going to be fucking furious.
[33:01.29]How did you get in here?
[33:02.42]What?
[33:03.22]How did you get in here?
[33:07.64]Oh, my God.
[33:08.24]I'm fucking mad.
[33:08.92]I got to kill this guy because it's the only way that will satiate my anger is killing this guy right now.
[33:29.07]Holy shit.
[33:32.65]I'm going to cheese this shit out of this guy.
[33:33.95]I hate these fucking things.
[33:38.36]I don't like them.
[33:41.52]Dude, I can't.
[33:43.12]I don't care.
[33:44.62]I'm leaving.
[33:46.56]I'm leaving.
[33:49.76]He just moves too quickly.
[33:50.82]I don't care.
[33:51.52]I can run his head into the wall the whole time.
[33:57.26]What do I have?
[33:57.62]13?
[33:57.70]I need 15.
[33:58.56]These guys don't even get that much souls either.
[34:00.68]There's such a pain in the ass that you can't... Get me to the other spot.
[34:07.61]Like down here.
[34:08.15]Go somewhere else.
[34:13.67]Yeah, I'm leaving the world's worst area.
[34:19.48]This guy's back too.
[34:20.20]Alright.
[34:24.00]34 minutes in and the maul has started.
[34:25.86]Oh, just those hands.
[34:27.22]That's it.
[34:28.06]I promise I won't get mad for another 30 minutes as long as no fucking hands are involved.
[34:37.85]I gotta... I gotta find somebody to kill.
[34:46.44]Wasn't there somebody, like, right out here?
[34:47.42]This is where, like, the lightning stuff was happening.
[34:53.04]No, no, I'm back here at the end place!
[34:57.60]Alright.
[35:04.40]No more complaining, I'm killing these hands right now.
[35:07.66]Get down here, now, get down here!
[35:10.42]Get down here, go!
[35:15.72]Not two, I don't want two.
[35:16.67]Not two, not two, not two!
[35:18.29]I would've done one!
[35:27.29]Oh my god.
[35:28.05]Oh my god.
[35:28.39]I hate these motherfuckers so much.
[35:35.80]I don't even want to be here, but my body keeps gravitating back here because I fucking hate this place so much.
[35:41.36]I want to wipe this whole place out.
[35:50.06]The boy has betrayed you.
[35:51.00]No, it took too long to cast.
[35:52.09]Alright, I'm just getting my souls and leaving.
[36:25.10]I just need a few thousand.
[36:26.26]Get him right here.
[36:36.61]Alright, give me 2,000 souls, please.
[36:39.71]Thank you.
[36:53.93]Oh shit!
[37:00.07]Now let's get the boys involved too, why not.
[37:06.55]I can upgrade the boys again by the way.
[37:22.98]Look at how much better of an idea this was.
[37:24.54]This is so much smarter.
[37:28.66]Why would I even... Why would I torture myself with this stupid hand enemy?
[37:31.88]When I could just go on a, like, EXP trip.
[37:40.35]Oh, I got a helm.
[37:50.56]Alright, gone.
[37:52.02]Little bit more.
[37:52.42]That's it.
[37:52.90]One more.
[37:53.26]Nobody else die.
[37:54.26]I picked it to be you.
[37:59.14]Alright, goodbye.
[38:01.12]Thanks for the experience.
[38:03.51]Appreciate it.
[38:03.99]Alright, I'm out.
[38:08.97]Let's go.
[38:17.67]Oh, they're chasing me.
[38:18.45]Okay.
[38:18.91]Well... Kill these guys.
[38:25.25]What the fuck?
[38:25.77]He must have just killed me in one hit.
[38:28.33]Alright, get me out.
[38:32.41]Let's go.
[38:37.25]Okay.
[38:37.79]We're ready.
[38:38.13]We're good.
[38:38.85]Everything is fine.
[38:39.89]Everybody can relax.
[38:41.69]Everything is good.
[38:43.17]Nothing is... There's no problem.
[38:45.29]Why are you getting zits at 42?
[38:49.45]Did you know that it doesn't matter how old you are?
[38:51.85]You can still get pimples all the way through to your, like, 80.
[38:54.51]Ooh, look what we can do now.
[39:03.13]I have 100 mana.
[39:08.69]I have 100 mana.
[39:12.21]Oleg can actually show up now.
[39:15.95]Okay, let's give it a try.
[39:22.24]There's Oleg.
[39:23.31]I wonder how, uh, good Oleg is.
[39:25.03]Takes the entire mana bar, by the way.
[39:29.15]Okay, now I'm safe, I'm comfortable, I'm gonna go up.
[39:31.57]Are you ready?
[39:34.11]Use the pouch for the summons.
[39:35.41]You know what?
[39:36.03]What a fucking brilliant person you really are.
[39:39.50]Uh, let's take this off here.
[39:42.30]Let's get those... Where's the pouch?
[39:45.00]Like, equipment, pouch, right?
[39:46.32]Is this it?
[39:46.70]Where is it?
[39:48.34]How do I get a pouch?
[39:52.13]Is there a way to do it?
[39:52.73]Does it have to be in the inventory?
[39:57.37]Which right?
[39:57.91]How do I do it?
[39:58.51]Is it the first screen?
[40:04.14]How do I switch to the pouch?
[40:08.30]Right side of the first screen?
[40:11.95]Oh shit, okay.
[40:13.29]How do I assign something?
[40:14.29]Switch, okay.
[40:16.15]I will go right stick for Oleg.
[40:19.90]Right D-pad.
[40:21.66]We'll do left D-pad for the boys.
[40:26.80]And then down D-pad for the dogs.
[40:28.30]This is actually so much more useful.
[40:29.76]Why the hell did I not do this?
[40:30.70]Okay, so then I can go like this.
[40:36.61]Yeah, that's much better.
[40:37.35]Cool.
[40:37.85]Thank you.
[40:39.72]I'm so glad that actually I haven't streamed this in, like, three days.
[40:41.81]So you guys, like, know how to do, like, all, like, the actual quality of life stuff that I didn't pay attention to.
[40:49.78]Because I know a shitload of you guys are at least, like, a full day ahead of me now.
[40:55.20]So, I'm grateful.
[40:59.06]Alright, let's do it.
[41:19.39]Oh, it's you.
[41:20.65]What do you have?
[41:22.25]Oh, again we cross paths.
[41:26.03]I believe I said my name was Rena when last we met.
[41:29.43]Is it a lie?
[41:30.27]It pleaseth me to see Torrent hale and hearty, but tarnished.
[41:35.73]What business hast thou here?
[41:37.73]Over items.
[41:38.09]I have no memory of inking thee an invitation.
[41:43.06]No particular reason.
[41:44.02]What?
[41:58.63]I stole death long ago.
[42:00.21]Didn't you say your name was Rana?
[42:01.39]I search now for the dark path.
[42:03.37]What's your name?
[42:03.95]That I might one day upend the whole of it.
[42:06.82]What's this person's name?
[42:07.74]And the world of all that came before.
[42:10.26]Well, has that roused thy interest?
[42:15.74]Serve Ronnie the Witch.
[42:17.90]I don't know if I should do this.
[42:19.44]I don't know what this does.
[42:25.21]I'm afraid.
[42:27.55]I'm afraid.
[42:30.09]I'm afraid.
[42:30.71]I did it.
[42:35.99]Which sorceries?
[42:37.39]Why am I under your command?
[42:38.79]I thought you were going to... I thought this was like I was going to...
[42:57.33]Do, like, a couple of little gigs for you.
[42:58.91]I didn't think I was gonna be, like, under your command.
[43:01.68]Blade.
[43:02.78]Hidden treasure of Nokron?
[43:21.73]What?
[43:21.99]Wait, are we gonna like ride together somewhere?
[43:26.69]Okay, there's more people?
[43:28.35]Are we about to do like a- Are we about to become like the Wizard of Oz?
[43:35.23]Are we gonna have like four people?
[43:37.19]Okay.
[43:50.02]Speak with the three who will wait below.
[43:51.74]Okay, so they're just waiting for me below?
[43:53.24]I'm very interested.
[43:55.24]Alright, let's go.
[43:55.84]Are we gonna go kill the dragon together?
[44:24.26]I'm very interested right now.
[44:27.86]Is that them?
[44:28.24]Oh, no.
[44:30.20]That's just like a brass.
[44:34.55]Wait.
[44:35.35]Who's this?
[44:36.35]What do you want?
[44:38.23]Oh, so you were the one.
[44:41.81]Lady Ranni has explained everything.
[44:44.11]Is this the blacksmith?
[44:46.85]The Carian royal family's dedicated blacksmith and Lady Ranni's war counsellor.
[44:52.99]I'm told that you are searching for Nokron with Blaidd.
[44:56.79]I will give you whatever guidance I can and pray for your success.
[45:04.29]Okay.
[45:04.63]What's your guidance?
[45:05.59]Don't underestimate me.
[45:07.35]Okay.
[45:32.90]What?
[45:33.48]Let us give all that we can.
[45:34.91]Okay.
[45:35.61]Let us give all that we can.
[45:36.73]Sure.
[45:37.19]Alright.
[45:38.19]Well, what kind of potions are you going to give me?
[45:43.55]Where's the sack of jewels that are going to help us on our journey?
[45:46.17]Alright.
[45:46.73]Are they outside?
[45:47.46]What am I drinking?
[45:50.82]That is matcha.
[45:52.64]It's a green tea matcha powdered drink.
[45:59.42]I heard about you.
[46:02.18]Good to finally meet.
[46:03.76]Name's Blaidd.
[46:05.68]Sworn sword to Mistress Ranni.
[46:07.90]Glad to have you aboard.
[46:09.62]Well, getting right to business.
[46:12.84]Okay.
[46:13.28]I'm situated in Limgrave right now.
[46:15.56]The eternal city of Nokron lies somewhere at the bottom of this land.
[46:19.88]I'm planning to go below through the well in the Mistwood.
[46:22.14]The well in the Mistwood.
[46:23.00]See if I can't find the road to Nokron.
[46:25.02]The well in the Mistwood.
[46:27.54]Let me write that down.
[46:28.12]Me.
[46:28.18]Can I write that down?
[46:37.71]okay well in the mistwood okay alright well in the mistwood for the uh worgen guy and then wait is that all you had to say
[47:05.79]I'm going below through the well in the mistwood.
[47:08.13]See if I can't find the road to Nokron.
[47:10.31]Don't keep me waiting.
[47:11.99]I won't, I won't, I won't.
[47:12.81]Well, how can, well, how come, why are they force ghosts?
[47:17.54]I see.
[47:19.50]You must be Ranni's new hireling.
[47:22.36]I kind of like this person.
[47:23.30]Yes, yes, I've heard all about you.
[47:27.50]I am Celebes.
[47:29.01]Celebes.
[47:29.59]Preceptor in the sorcerous arts.
[47:32.17]I like this, I like this guy.
[47:33.07]I don't know what it is the mistress sees in a provincial tarnished like you.
[47:38.31]I like this guy.
[47:38.97]But since we have the misfortune of serving the same lady, I ask that you kindly try not to drag us all down with you.
[47:50.32]So where are you going to be?
[47:51.34]I reside in another tower.
[47:53.92]Another tower.
[47:56.18]Okay.
[47:56.62]Very cool.
[47:57.17]Turn the sound up.
[47:58.59]Yeah, it looks like it was a little low.
[48:01.23]I got you.
[48:01.63]I got you.
[48:02.11]Sound going up.
[48:25.35]Because I reside in another tower.
[48:31.23]Do I have to pick one of these three that I want to play with?
[48:39.27]Oh, you're in this one or this one.
[48:41.35]Does it matter?
[48:41.83]Where's the Mistwood?
[48:46.21]Mistwood.
[48:49.07]Where is that?
[48:51.07]Have I not found that yet?
[48:51.89]Where's Mistwood?
[48:59.57]It's east of Limgrave.
[49:02.43]Fistwood!
[49:03.13]Okay.
[49:05.15]Yeah, he did say Lim.
[49:06.05]But, uh... What about the guy with the hat?
[49:11.70]What about the guy with the hat?
[49:14.90]This choice will have consequences.
[49:16.64]What?
[49:18.41]What about the big guy?
[49:19.47]He didn't say where he was gonna be.
[49:20.71]Wait, I know where he is.
[49:22.71]Oh no, I have to pick one of these three?
[49:28.31]So, let me get... Okay, I've got a prediction.
[49:32.89]Oh, no.
[49:36.85]There are no choices?
[49:39.15]Oh.
[49:39.75]There's not a choice.
[49:41.01]Okay.
[49:42.15]Alright, alright, alright.
[49:42.95]So, if that doesn't matter, I was kind of concerned.
[49:45.43]So, I'm going to go to that, but first I'm going to go to the tower where this guy is.
[49:49.33]You don't get to pick.
[49:50.65]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[49:54.26]So I want to go to this tower.
[49:55.44]I think it's this one here.
[49:57.23]Unless it was the one that was closed before.
[50:00.05]But I'm going to check this place out.
[50:01.23]That is so cool.
[50:02.39]I'm really excited.
[50:10.89]Is this this one here?
[50:15.21]Or choice matters.
[50:20.47]Okay, well... Alright, I'm literally gonna... Excuse me?
[50:24.95]What's going on here?
[50:26.11]Is this an invisible wall?
[50:30.15]That's odd.
[50:30.65]That shouldn't be here.
[50:32.59]I'm screwed up there.
[50:33.15]Go talk to Ronnie first.
[50:35.69]Okay.
[50:41.38]Why can't I leave?
[50:42.16]It's because I can't... I can't leave the zone?
[50:50.55]I have to go talk to Arani or I can't leave.
[50:52.45]Okay.
[50:52.65]This seems pretty cool.
[50:59.42]I'm actually pretty excited for this.
[51:17.63]We're off to see the wizard, the wonderful Wizard of Oz.
[51:21.33]Here is a hell of a... I don't know the lyrics.
[51:26.75]Allow me to forewarn thee.
[51:28.71]I shall soon enter my slumber and it will be some time before I wake.
[51:34.16]This doll's body is not without its hindrances.
[51:37.86]Still.
[51:39.50]What are we doing?
[51:40.90]I don't even know what the quest is.
[51:44.17]What's the quest?
[51:44.83]All she said is, I'm gonna go to sleep.
[52:07.93]Oh, the treasure.
[52:08.93]Right, right, right.
[52:09.55]Alright, here we go.
[52:11.30]It's time.
[52:12.18]We're going to go explore.
[52:14.44]I want to go see what is the deal.
[52:16.80]I want to see what the deal is at the tower.
[52:22.24]Because I want to talk to... They're all gone.
[52:24.24]But you know what I mean?
[52:26.08]Not fighting that dragon right now.
[52:27.36]We got way bigger fish to fry.
[52:29.75]And it's not a huge dragon.
[52:31.87]Nope.
[52:32.65]Not even cool.
[52:33.89]Not even remotely interesting.
[52:35.39]Let's go.
[52:42.02]Oh my God!
[52:43.00]I think I'm fine.
[52:50.42]I'm too excited.
[52:51.45]Fuck.
[52:56.39]We're off to see the wizard, the wonderful wizard of the- Dorothy!
[53:18.46]What do we do now?
[53:19.32]I don't know.
[53:21.16]I'm not sure what we do now.
[53:23.76]What do we do?
[53:24.52]What do we do?
[53:25.18]Okay, it's hard to do that without the cringe.
[53:27.04]It is.
[53:27.76]The lion is hard to do without absolute cringe.
[53:31.86]Do you understand how hard that is to do?
[53:33.49]Like, without everybody being like, Stop.
[53:37.91]Put a mob.
[53:38.51]Put a mob.
[53:39.13]What are you doing?
[53:41.03]Nobody can do that without... It has to be that actor.
[53:43.23]Like, nobody else can.
[53:44.45]It's kind of... Like, anybody else doing that is cringey.
[53:51.74]You're the lion.
[53:52.70]No, I am not the lion.
[53:57.18]No, I would not be the lion.
[53:58.66]And I would not be the mayor of Munchkinland.
[54:02.82]Okay, so let's get that out of the way.
[54:04.73]I would be the scarecrow.
[54:15.77]Get the fuck away from me.
[54:17.94]I would be the scarecrow.
[54:19.63]You know how I know I'd be the scarecrow?
[54:20.97]Because the scarecrow does like little movements.
[54:22.99]He like goes like this and like this.
[54:24.63]And he like puts his hands like this and shit.
[54:26.17]Like that's me.
[54:27.03]That's me.
[54:28.28]I'm the scarecrow.
[54:29.20]Alright, there's this person.
[54:35.48]So, here we go.
[54:38.00]Well, well, you took me at my word.
[54:41.82]Did you not realize I was merely being polite?
[54:45.68]You provincials never cease to amaze.
[54:49.08]Okay.
[54:51.22]I suppose you're here now.
[54:52.84]Perhaps I'll give you something to do.
[54:54.70]Something to do?
[54:55.74]I'd like you to find a woman called Nefeli to administer a potion.
[55:00.23]Even you can do that much.
[55:01.95]Where are they?
[55:02.55]Should I do it?
[55:06.11]I'll do it.
[55:08.12]Good, good.
[55:09.94]Now I shall hand over the potion in question.
[55:13.09]Okay.
[55:14.41]Celibus's potion.
[55:16.13]Find Nefeli and ensure she drinks it.
[55:18.51]Find Nefeli.
[55:19.55]I expect glad tidings.
[55:22.27]And soon.
[55:24.99]Where who?
[55:26.59]I have no time for idle chit.
[55:28.13]The only thing I will hear from you is a report of your task's completion.
[55:31.78]Are we understood?
[55:33.08]I have enough on my plate.
[55:36.62]Do you know what?
[55:38.90]Where are they?
[55:39.70]Does it say on the thing?
[55:50.76]Where is it?
[55:55.82]What if I just like drink it in front of them?
[56:00.68]Where is it?
[56:01.06]It would look like a key item.
[56:06.08]Oh, there it is.
[56:06.48]Um... I don't have a... I don't know where that person is.
[56:09.02]I need to put it on my notepad.
[56:09.86]Okay.
[56:09.96]Sure.
[56:44.10]Maybe, but what if I don't?
[56:45.84]Alright.
[56:54.85]That'll confuse me.
[56:55.67]I'll just... That's the potion quest.
[56:58.13]Okay.
[57:01.91]Sounds good.
[57:05.38]What if it's poison?
[57:06.54]I mean, it probably is poison.
[57:07.54]And I'm going to have to make a decision whether or not I want to keep that person alive or not.
[57:17.36]Alright, what if I just give him the potion?
[57:19.78]If I'm like, here, how about a nice ice cold Sprite?
[57:23.00]Oh, thank you, of course.
[57:25.97]And then I'll get his hat.
[57:39.27]Ooh, good, very good, very good, very good.
[57:44.01]Another spell slot.
[57:47.83]So what about, can I go back in here though?
[57:50.07]Because now it's like, okay, maybe not.
[57:52.57]I could try.
[57:52.93]Alright, mist, where the mist is.
[58:02.05]The well in the Mistwood.
[58:05.86]Check it out.
[58:12.84]You wouldn't download a car.
[58:16.14]No, I... You're right, I wouldn't.
[58:20.20]If I was a well, I would probably be, like, here somewhere.
[58:25.46]That's a well.
[58:26.76]That is a well.
[58:29.49]Is it just... Okay, down... Is it just in Siofro?
[58:31.39]Okay, how do I switch map to go down to... Okay.
[58:42.25]Let's do it.
[58:43.05]I need to, like, switch...
[58:50.50]Oh shit, alright, so where's he gonna be?
[58:56.20]Just, I'll be down the well.
[58:58.00]Just right in the front?
[58:58.76]Front door?
[59:04.48]I'll be down the well, you'll find me by the well.
[59:06.94]Right, something like that.
[59:17.93]I don't think he's here.
[59:24.79]Riverbank.
[59:27.50]Maybe this is how to get here with this, uh, with this quest.
[59:31.82]This way?
[59:36.60]How can we read the most out of context messages?
[59:39.37]I don't know.
[59:43.67]We're just looking for him.
[59:45.23]He's going to be sitting somewhere in a weird spot.
[59:48.86]His arms crossed.
[59:50.14]Just like sitting there.
[59:57.78]Frames?
[59:58.46]Fuck.
[60:00.64]There he is.
[60:03.28]Frames?
[60:03.86]Fuck.
[60:11.83]That's him right there.
[60:15.63]Alright, I found him.
[60:19.79]There you are!
[60:20.59]Alright, cool.
[60:24.50]He's really intimidating.
[60:26.79]Do you fight these guys?
[60:27.61]What do you have to say about these guys that shoot the bow and arrows from across the whole game?
[60:31.47]I mean, you could probably just kill them.
[60:33.01]Are you going to kill them?
[60:34.21]Can I kill- Will he die?
[60:35.23]Alright, fight them.
[60:37.47]Show me what you can do.
[60:40.49]Very intimidating.
[60:42.03]That's right.
[60:42.39]See who I'm with?
[60:44.61]I'm with the guy that you don't want to fuck with.
[60:46.73]And we're together, and we're coming to the party together.
[60:50.87]Yeah.
[60:51.51]And that's something.
[60:53.33]And that's something.
[60:54.29]Yeah.
[61:00.19]Hey, I got this.
[61:08.60]Don't get up.
[61:14.19]I thought he killed me.
[61:15.51]I thought it was like a fucking scam.
[61:18.15]I thought it was a scam.
[61:21.07]Like apologies, like sorry mate, like boom, like arrow in the neck.
[61:25.94]Let's give him a squeeze.
[61:28.90]Show him just how sharp my teeth are.
[61:32.34]I missed that whole fucking thing.
[61:34.22]I just hear, ugh, apologies, mate.
[61:36.62]Nothing to report so far.
[61:37.96]Boom!
[61:38.46]Out.
[61:40.22]I fucking swear to God, I'm gonna throw this guy.
[61:42.17]I'm gonna just grab him by his legs and just spin, spin, spin, and throw him into a fucking bomb.
[61:49.83]I am trying to immerse myself in the world.
[61:52.53]Leave me alone.
[61:54.79]And I don't care about your world immersion.
[61:57.77]I don't care about your story arc.
[61:59.13]I care about that story arc of the big hairy guy.
[62:02.02]I don't give a shit about your story.
[62:08.84]Okay.
[62:10.32]Can you repeat that whole thing?
[62:11.60]Because I missed everything.
[62:15.62]God damn it!
[62:18.44]Is he still gonna be there?
[62:19.60]He's gonna be there, right?
[62:21.32]Is he still gonna be there?
[62:23.29]He's still gonna be on the ledge.
[62:25.38]What if he's gone?
[62:26.18]It's because when you get on the horse you move forward like... Okay, thank God you're still there.
[62:46.58]Please leave me alone.
[62:47.64]I don't want to aggro anything.
[62:54.42]I already did, but whatever.
[62:55.72]Like, I'll just kill them.
[63:04.49]Are you gonna shoot an arrow from all the way down there?
[63:06.27]You better not.
[63:06.91]Okay, he's shooting the arrow into a rocket.
[63:10.83]Just, can we walk this way?
[63:12.89]Alright, I'll show you what I got.
[63:20.52]You're working with a sorcerer.
[63:31.03]Impressive.
[63:33.23]Was that Loretta's great bomb?
[63:35.95]I haven't seen that move in at least three or four years.
[63:38.63]How did you come across such an incredible item?
[63:41.45]Well, well.
[63:43.89]I jest.
[63:45.64]I wouldn't go that far.
[63:47.26]Besides, I should check on some things here.
[63:51.34]Leave this place to me.
[63:53.78]You just do what you feel is right.
[63:55.72]If either of us learns anything, we tell the other.
[64:00.40]Right?
[64:00.84]Right.
[64:02.41]What did you- What was the first thing you told me?
[64:04.07]Leave this place to me.
[64:05.29]If either of us- And if we reach a dead end, I suppose we go back to the source.
[64:09.55]Celibus rarely gives a straight answer.
[64:11.99]The first time.
[64:14.45]God damn it!
[64:15.61]I keep thinking you're betraying me!
[64:18.19]I swear to God!
[64:24.38]Stop!
[64:25.64]Okay.
[64:27.60]What was the first thing he said?
[64:28.92]I was freaking out.
[64:30.80]He was like, let's go up there and beat that person up.
[64:33.70]He mentioned about us beating somebody up.
[64:38.29]Where did, what did he say?
[64:39.29]He's like, oh, if we go beat that person up.
[64:47.93]He said to go talk to, he meant Celibus.
[64:51.15]He said you go talk to Celibus.
[64:52.81]Okay.
[64:53.03]Okay.
[64:54.95]Okay.
[64:56.07]Alright.
[64:57.11]Okay.
[64:58.61]God damn it, man.
[65:00.65]Go talk to the sorcerer.
[65:01.83]Come back.
[65:03.13]I have a potion from the sorcerer.
[65:07.39]Squeeze the sorcerer, right?
[65:18.44]We have new dialog with Celibus.
[65:25.87]Please tell this is this one down here.
[65:27.35]This is cool.
[65:37.27]Oh, mind the dragon.
[65:48.03]Hey.
[65:53.27]What info do you have?
[66:07.50]Dead if you keep going here, bud.
[66:08.82]What's going on?
[66:09.88]Who's that?
[66:10.44]Limgrave?
[66:33.23]Is that the lady that I found in Celibus' introduction?
[66:41.20]Okay.
[66:42.24]Is that the lady, the Burger Queen?
[66:45.54]Yep.
[66:46.70]Okay, I gotta remember where that was.
[66:47.72]Burger Queen was... Where?
[66:53.87]Somewhere in one of these caves.
[66:57.05]Waypoint Ruins?
[66:59.17]It was really, really close to the start of the game.
[67:02.35]I think it's this one here.
[67:02.95]Waypoint Ruins.
[67:04.43]I think.
[67:05.79]Am I still dropping frames?
[67:08.25]What the fuck?
[67:10.03]That's annoying.
[67:11.07]It shouldn't be doing that.
[67:14.77]Let me see.
[67:25.56]It should even out.
[67:29.00]I don't know why it's doing this.
[67:35.78]Yeah, I mean, I'm dropping frames on OBS.
[67:39.31]But my internet connection's fine.
[67:40.93]I don't know.
[67:41.71]Maybe it's, like, my connection to the, um... It might be my connection to the Twitch servers.
[67:47.63]So... Because everything else seems perfectly fine.
[67:53.72]Happens, like, every five to ten minutes.
[67:55.04]Hmm.
[67:56.38]Alright, well, here we go.
[67:57.80]There you are, my apprentice.
[68:00.10]Shall we commence the last...
[68:02.95]Well, well.
[68:04.45]Salavis is not a name I ever wanted to hear again.
[68:07.60]But fine.
[68:09.12]If it will help you, my apprentice.
[68:11.92]I offer my knowledge.
[68:12.92]Thank you.
[68:13.50]The stars alter the fate of the Carrion royal family.
[68:17.77]And the fate of your mistress, Ranni.
[68:20.19]But long ago, General Radan challenged the swirling constellations.
[68:25.21]Huh?
[68:25.33]Okay, um, I'm gonna hand you a piece of paper, and can you just write down a name and an X on where they are?
[68:29.98]And then how... You know what I mean?
[68:31.02]Like, I don't... What does that mean?
[68:54.64]Ooh.
[68:55.02]Alright.
[69:01.52]Ooh.
[69:02.94]Ooh.
[69:05.59]That's new.
[69:09.23]Okay, so now we take that.
[69:11.91]We take that back to the sorcerer guy, or do I go back to the wolf now?
[69:26.73]I think the wolf at this point.
[69:28.01]Yeah.
[69:29.89]Very cool.
[69:30.37]Alright.
[69:30.61]So now we got to go talk to the wolf.
[69:33.57]You were here.
[69:39.76]This is crazy.
[69:45.38]Pepe laugh.
[69:48.04]Haha, Pepe laugh.
[69:48.86]Alright.
[69:49.24]Well, that's not good.
[69:49.92]This is the best boss in the game.
[69:52.80]Do spell slot.
[69:53.50]You're exactly right, but I can do it later.
[70:19.01]Oh shit!
[70:28.24]Don't kill him.
[70:28.90]I need him.
[70:29.40]I was seeing if he would get angry.
[70:32.60]What if he's right at the head and died?
[70:34.38]Oh my god, that would be horrible.
[70:36.64]I'm freaking out right now.
[70:38.72]Oh my fucking god.
[70:39.62]Alright, I thought I actually fucked everything up.
[70:44.52]I honestly thought I fucked up the whole game, and I thought he was going to get aggroed and break his quest.
[70:49.96]Is this your first time playing?
[70:55.52]No, no.
[70:56.28]I beat every Souls game.
[70:57.60]I beat Sekiro on stream.
[70:59.00]Final boss in Sekiro, which is one of the hardest things I've ever done.
[71:02.00]So don't worry.
[71:02.68]I'll get it eventually.
[71:15.03]He's still bragging about Sekiro.
[71:16.95]Yeah, I will take that to the grave because I know people that abandon... I know a shitload of people abandon Sekiro at the last, like, hour of the game.
[71:24.74]I didn't.
[71:26.06]I beat it.
[71:26.96]I beat the last fucking guy.
[71:28.14]And I know a bunch of people are like, yeah, fuck that game.
[71:29.84]I'm not ever playing that ever again.
[71:31.29]And I was like, yeah, and then I beat him.
[71:51.39]Do you guys have to seriously have an aggro range that's this far?
[71:53.71]Just get out of here.
[71:54.59]Okay, we're good.
[71:56.57]Ah, what news?
[71:59.81]Here's the story.
[72:01.99]So Ranni's fate is kept in stasis by Starscourge Radahn.
[72:06.15]That reminds me of something I heard.
[72:07.47]What did you hear?
[72:08.55]There's a festival being held at the castle on the southern edge of the Caelid Wiles, east of Limgrave.
[72:14.38]It's a festival of combat.
[72:16.54]And I heard that you can fight Radahn himself.
[72:21.05]He who was once called the strongest of all the demigods.
[72:24.84]Maybe it's just a coincidence.
[72:27.80]I think it's worth investigating.
[72:30.02]I'll be on my way to this festival of Redan.
[72:32.34]Okay.
[72:35.79]And Big F, I know.
[72:36.75]You're coming too, right?
[72:38.21]I'll meet you at Redmane Castle in Caelid.
[72:40.25]Redmane Castle in Caelid.
[72:43.19]We fight sword and fire.
[72:46.80]You understand, like, why did this guy do this?
[72:49.36]Why did... He was de-aggroed.
[72:53.51]These guys weren't even... It's been, like, oh, two minutes.
[73:02.45]Just get... You are way too level forward, Dan.
[73:09.54]Uh, oh, I still... Kaelin's over there.
[73:21.04]I beat Redan.
[73:21.92]Eh, okay.
[73:23.04]Well, at least I want to check... Maybe I'll check it out.
[73:25.08]Okay, so... That is... Here?
[73:32.30]Probably up here somewhere.
[73:33.72]I haven't been over here really at all.
[73:35.62]So, I don't know.
[73:40.69]Maybe I... Okay, I have that activated now.
[73:43.57]Maybe I continue to trek this way?
[73:45.19]Because there's still stuff apparently up here that I haven't done.
[73:50.05]Is it visible up on the map?
[73:52.27]Is it?
[73:56.39]It's not this over here.
[73:57.21]It's like the festival.
[73:58.45]Is it here?
[73:59.45]No.
[74:02.71]It's probably there.
[74:03.23]I've been stuck on Redan for four days.
[74:09.17]Oh god, that's not encouraging.
[74:12.40]That's it?
[74:14.84]Wait, it is this.
[74:18.16]It's this?
[74:24.63]Okay.
[74:35.02]What does this do?
[74:35.54]Where does this go?
[74:38.56]Probably across the Great Bridge, right?
[74:52.68]I'm just seeing what's here.
[74:54.54]It said impassable bridge, but... I can walk across it.
[75:02.59]I don't know what they mean.
[75:03.25]Why does it say that?
[75:15.69]Is that going to take me just right to the...
[75:28.22]Oh.
[75:30.68]I'm just here now.
[75:37.55]Is a tournament or something going on?
[75:46.25]It's definitely right there.
[75:54.82]The Halo theme song.
[76:02.04]Okay, well I got this.
[76:06.58]I kind of want to check out what's going on back there though.
[76:11.10]This is a festival.
[76:12.16]Yeah, should I do that?
[76:12.92]I kind of don't want to like have the frame rate.
[76:15.12]I don't want like the internet to fuck up in the middle of one of these fights, right?
[76:17.66]Because then how am I supposed to prove if I beat it?
[76:19.02]I'm kind of scared.
[76:21.85]Maybe I'll come back later?
[76:29.48]Is it actually a tournament arc?
[76:30.80]What?
[76:30.90]It's actually a tournament?
[76:32.24]This is insane.
[76:34.70]How many bosses do you fight?
[76:55.15]Grab the Great Rune.
[76:58.17]Man.
[77:25.06]I feel real bad for... I've been practicing this new move.
[77:28.46]It's Loretta's Great Bow.
[77:32.27]It's for anybody that... You know, just in case somebody thought they were going to be... At least made me think they could compete against me.
[77:38.39]You know what I mean?
[77:41.25]I mean, I beat Loretta.
[77:42.71]Killed Loretta.
[77:43.25]A mere hours ago.
[77:44.73]Got some pretty cool moves.
[77:46.39]You know, it's still time to back out of the tournament.
[77:49.51]Fucking loser.
[77:52.93]It isn't a tarnished warrior.
[77:55.25]I am the warrior Ja, Iron Fist Alexander.
[77:58.93]Fist Alexander?
[78:02.31]Do you know for whom this festival is being held?
[78:05.82]Well, it is none other than General Radahn himself.
[78:11.26]To think I could face a great champion of the shattering.
[78:16.51]Okay.
[78:16.75]Get a good vantage.
[78:17.55]Iron fist.
[78:18.11]Look at that guy.
[78:21.59]Ah.
[78:48.39]Y'all should just go home.
[78:50.87]Okay.
[78:51.61]Who's that?
[78:52.25]Wait.
[78:52.63]What else do you have to say?
[78:53.28]This is crazy.
[78:53.94]I like this.
[78:55.30]Get a good vantage.
[78:56.56]Okay.
[78:57.78]What about you?
[78:58.20]Can I do that?
[79:07.40]Now what do you have to say?
[79:17.23]What's going on with your hand here?
[79:20.84]Alright.
[79:21.28]Alright.
[79:21.46]We gotta go through all these clowns.
[79:24.04]Into the fray together.
[79:28.80]So wait.
[79:29.14]It's like a tag team matches?
[79:31.70]Is it 2v2?
[79:33.00]This is cool.
[79:33.92]Okay.
[79:34.26]I can't wait.
[79:34.68]This is actually awesome.
[79:36.96]We're gonna get 2v2s.
[79:39.38]Into the fray together.
[79:40.52]Let's go.
[79:40.92]Uh.
[79:47.08]Are you good and prepared, young chum?
[79:49.90]The festival begins.
[79:52.97]Let's do it.
[79:55.45]I'm gonna get my ass kicked.
[79:57.24]Wow.
[79:57.50]Before we begin, allow me to paint you the full picture.
[80:02.26]What?
[80:17.23]long time ago.
[80:18.69]General Radahn is cursed ever to wander.
[80:26.88]Eaten from the inside by Malenia's scarlet rot, his wits are long gone.
[80:41.31]Now he gathers the corpses of former friends and foes alike.
[80:57.45]Howling at the sky.
[81:01.73]But now.
[81:03.29]We must make merry.
[81:05.24]Oh, gathering of champions.
[81:08.08]The rebels begin.
[81:10.34]The celebration of war.
[81:14.02]The Redan Festival.
[81:16.30]Do I have to start killing this guy next to me?
[81:20.11]Heartening cry.
[81:20.83]Do I have to start fighting him?
[81:22.27]Do I backstab this guy?
[81:23.53]Is it everywhere for himself?
[81:27.44]It's time to battle!
[81:28.91]Okay, so he's through here.
[81:30.81]Oh, okay.
[81:31.09]So, I get it.
[81:31.95]But wait.
[81:33.17]Is there anything else I can see?
[81:34.03]There might be something I can pick up.
[81:35.37]You guys are all on the same team.
[81:36.55]What if I had backstabbed him?
[81:37.69]What would happen?
[81:58.24]Would I have just ruined this quest line?
[82:02.46]Thank God I can actually upgrade this weapon now.
[82:06.36]It's been like six plus hours in game time.
[82:09.66]Let me just check what's going on here.
[82:20.61]I don't want to just run out there.
[82:29.35]Uh, is something in here?
[82:30.17]Anything?
[82:30.49]Yeah, there is.
[82:36.69]Smithing Stone 6.
[82:38.27]Nice.
[82:39.29]I don't think I've seen one of those yet.
[82:42.67]Where does this go?
[82:51.00]Should I just see what this does?
[82:52.32]Curious.
[82:54.86]Does it go down or up?
[83:02.28]Yeah, I'm gonna upgrade my weapon.
[83:09.07]Goes down here.
[83:09.87]Okay.
[83:12.45]What is this?
[83:14.47]Okay, did I just like find something else?
[83:18.03]There's like a summoning thing here.
[83:19.17]There's definitely a boss right here.
[83:20.55]Did I?
[83:21.14]I just like wandered away.
[83:24.12]Can I walk in this?
[83:42.31]I'm just- I'm curious.
[83:44.63]Where does this go?
[83:50.12]Wait, I've- I thought- What happened to the tournament?
[83:53.80]Wha- I thought we were in a tournament!
[83:55.76]Starscourge Redan?
[83:58.08]I thought we were in a tournament together!
[84:07.47]What's all this shit?
[84:10.49]Alright, I gotta get the timing down on this.
[84:16.29]Dude, I'm like confused.
[84:17.62]It's like travel so fast, but so slow at the same time.
[84:22.62]I... Okay, just don't drink.
[84:25.74]It's... What is this shit on the ground?
[84:35.36]So I'm in... Oh shit, let's go!
[84:37.70]Wait, I can just bring everybody in here?
[84:42.45]Um, but for...
[84:44.26]I don't give a shit about the emote I just unlocked.
[84:48.23]I don't care.
[84:48.91]Like, put it in the fucking top left of the screen.
[84:51.39]I... Alright.
[84:58.35]No.
[85:04.29]You don't need to teach me your dance move.
[85:06.01]Like, when I press the button to... Alright.
[85:08.35]I'm gonna upgrade this shit.
[85:12.03]Do I have enough to...
[85:15.40]I don't have enough souls to do it.
[85:17.55]I can probably sell some stuff.
[85:18.47]Yeah, I will.
[85:26.83]Let me upgrade my weapon.
[85:33.56]That should be fun.
[85:35.92]Okay, if I summon each person and they teach me a dance move, is that going to be annoying?
[85:39.07]Am I going to have to get it off the screen?
[85:41.87]Is that going to be annoying?
[85:58.72]So, let me get rid of some of this stuff.
[86:04.00]I know for a fact I'm not going to use... I don't want to sell it though.
[86:08.74]I want this stuff.
[86:12.83]Okay, I have two of these.
[86:24.05]I don't want these bug helmets.
[86:25.15]I'm not going to use them.
[86:25.67]I don't want to sell any of this.
[86:36.29]Fuck.
[86:36.63]I need to sell something.
[86:37.83]I'm going to sell some materials.
[86:38.91]Yeah.
[86:39.31]Oh, okay.
[86:40.31]Sell these.
[86:40.83]I don't need these.
[86:41.75]I need 800.
[86:56.99]Yeah, uses FP, throw magic darts.
[86:58.92]What am I gonna use those for?
[87:06.30]Okay, here we go.
[87:07.00]This will get us to plus five, which is way better than what it is right now.
[87:13.55]I need a Somber Smithing Stone six.
[87:16.75]Alright, that looks good.
[87:21.52]Sick, sick, sick.
[87:29.06]Let me... I want to do, like, the actual tournament.
[87:34.08]I don't want to just wander off to the beach and get killed.
[87:36.04]Look at me.
[87:44.23]He's purple.
[87:45.03]I'm just... I don't know.
[87:45.63]Sometimes I turn purple.
[87:46.51]Alright, let's try it.
[87:56.28]Alright, if I can't do this, if I'm not reliably going... Oh, I got this.
[88:06.72]That is the tournament.
[88:07.92]Oh, what was this thing here with the... Oh, okay.
[88:14.19]Alright.
[88:14.53]Spell slot?
[88:15.07]I'm not going to use it against him.
[88:16.13]I'm not going to use it for the boss anyways.
[88:18.11]It's okay.
[88:18.95]Alright, I'm ready.
[88:21.41]Alright.
[88:26.22]I'm ready.
[88:26.58]Do I have to do this every time?
[88:28.78]Does the guy have to tell me the story every time?
[88:37.59]I don't?
[88:37.85]Okay, so I can... So what happens if I go through this?
[88:42.17]Does this just take you to that area?
[88:44.13]What is, like, through this door?
[88:45.39]Or is this just blocked?
[88:46.07]Okay, so that's just blocked.
[88:52.64]Okay.
[88:54.48]I don't know if you get to go through it or something.
[88:58.28]Alright, let's go.
[88:58.84]I'm gonna try it.
[88:59.50]I gotta get that timing down.
[89:00.70]I gotta dodge, summon, dodge, summon, dodge, summon.
[89:16.31]Oh, right, because there was that statue.
[89:17.65]You're right.
[89:18.03]Okay.
[89:19.59]What's this?
[89:22.31]Anything here?
[89:22.65]Alright, let's go.
[89:26.89]Let's give it a try.
[89:33.15]Statue will be right here.
[89:37.35]Alright.
[89:41.31]Gaming begins.
[89:52.73]I don't think I'm going to use mana that much.
[89:55.11]We'll see.
[89:55.45]I really don't know.
[89:57.23]But let's try.
[89:59.11]Okay.
[90:01.31]It's time to fight this guy.
[90:03.03]Alright.
[90:05.61]Dodge.
[90:06.73]Summon.
[90:07.67]Dodge.
[90:08.25]Summon.
[90:08.55]Let's go!
[90:26.55]Everybody!
[90:28.57]Everyone!
[90:36.92]There's more people?
[90:40.02]Oh, the jar!
[90:48.50]Oh, shit!
[90:54.24]Get in there!
[90:59.84]Alright, get him, get him, get him!
[91:04.86]Someone, Patches?
[91:06.56]Wait, Patches is here?
[91:08.24]Everybody's here.
[91:10.74]Get in, get in, get in, get in, everybody get in.
[91:14.32]Hold on, let me get the item.
[91:21.86]Alright, Patches, go!
[91:22.70]There's like skin hanging off my mouth.
[91:30.71]Wait, Blade is dead!
[91:32.95]Why did Patches leave?
[91:42.47]Let's go Oh shit everybody's dead What is he on a horse?
[92:04.87]He's on a horse!
[92:06.49]What the fuck?
[92:09.12]Are you shitting me?
[92:10.94]That little, that poor horse.
[92:12.68]Yikes.
[92:35.44]Alright, let's go.
[92:45.83]What the fuck?
[92:48.31]I think that's a gravity move.
[93:00.22]Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.
[93:01.86]I have no stamina.
[93:02.52]Did he just drain my stamina?
[93:16.14]Holy shit.
[93:16.68]Okay, you gotta jump over that.
[93:22.03]I thought he was on wheels.
[93:30.41]I'm burning through stamina here.
[93:32.65]I wonder why.
[93:40.06]God damn it, man.
[94:13.72]Ah, shit!
[94:14.38]I'm dead.
[94:15.24]It's over.
[94:18.98]You can re-summon people?
[94:21.14]Resummon in phase two?
[94:26.33]I was just eating through stamina, unlike before.
[94:29.35]Okay.
[94:38.53]I was just inhaling stamina.
[94:42.00]You can resummon indefinitely.
[94:43.56]I can?
[94:49.08]I wonder if I should put more mana on and just shoot him with a bow.
[94:57.12]His stamina drains.
[94:58.18]Oh, that's what it is.
[94:59.75]Alright, can I just run through?
[95:03.23]Like, how hard is it to dodge this on the horse?
[95:04.89]Okay, I'm fucking just roving into it.
[95:09.55]Hold on a second.
[95:10.27]Alright, let me get this down.
[95:15.09]Can I, like, just go like this?
[95:17.62]Let me see.
[95:18.00]Hold on.
[95:22.69]Yeah, okay, so I was testing to see if you could just, like, run parallel to it.
[95:26.59]You cannot.
[95:28.77]So, uh, just kill me, because there's no reason to do this right now.
[95:35.28]I was seeing if you could just run, like, parallel, alright, perpendicular, and not get hit by it, but he hits you with it no matter what.
[95:42.30]Whatever, say, you know what I mean, the triangulation, whatever it is.
[95:47.56]Yeah, the sword runes break one hit.
[95:51.83]I think I got it.
[95:52.47]I think I got this.
[95:55.89]It's going to come down to just kind of running around and being patient.
[96:07.31]Try Oleg.
[96:08.87]I got to be up a little closer, I think.
[96:15.88]Here we go.
[96:17.02]You, you, you.
[96:21.81]You.
[96:32.59]You, you.
[96:33.29]Go, go, go, go, go.
[96:44.50]What the fuck are they doing?
[96:45.56]Why are they spinning around?
[96:51.89]Alright, let's go!
[96:55.71]What happened?
[96:59.59]Hello?
[96:59.81]What happened?
[97:02.27]What happened?
[97:02.67]What's going on?
[97:03.11]Where's my horse?
[97:11.28]What the fuck?
[97:12.76]What the fuck happened?
[97:15.18]Why did they die?
[97:16.20]What was that?
[97:18.54]Oh shit, that was dumb.
[97:22.76]Was I falling?
[97:23.56]That's fucking horseshit.
[97:28.88]Okay.
[97:29.24]Well, whatever.
[97:29.70]Alright.
[97:44.47]Get him again.
[97:46.07]So, when... You're saying that when he... When the summons die, I can go... Jesus.
[97:49.94]Jesus.
[97:55.92]So I can just run back and summon them all again.
[98:00.16]Wait, that's what we're doing.
[98:11.19]No!
[98:19.45]Everybody in!
[98:20.95]Everybody!
[98:25.03]Get on and get on!
[98:26.57]Oh my god, I'm just like fucking spamming.
[98:35.75]Okay.
[98:36.05]So, those things follow you around.
[98:38.21]Of course they do.
[98:39.73]So, can I summon them on the horse?
[98:42.02]I wonder if I can just dodge that shit and just run.
[98:49.84]See you guys in four days.
[98:51.32]No, no, no, no way.
[98:55.27]He has homing.
[98:57.13]I think I can- I could try to avoid it.
[98:59.83]It's like getting off the horse and having that, like, one and a half seconds of animation that you can't do anything with is what's- what'll get me killed if I get off the horse.
[99:07.50]Let me just see what happens if I do this.
[99:10.40]Like, can I- No, I can't.
[99:14.68]I'm just seeing if I can, like, dash, like, right when it's there.
[99:16.84]Alright, we're doing some- it's- it's- this is a test run.
[99:20.66]Test run.
[99:26.03]So you physically cannot avoid getting hit by that unless you jump over it.
[99:32.31]See, I didn't try dashing when it was right there.
[99:34.51]I tried running.
[99:35.19]I'm going to try jumping.
[99:38.57]Let's try jumping.
[99:39.19]Yeah, that's a test run.
[99:46.85]Yeah, I know I can use the scrap piles to block it.
[99:48.65]That's not what I'm concerned about.
[99:49.62]I'm concerned about, like, needing to go all the fucking way over there when he does that stupid arrow homing missile move.
[99:54.76]Let me see that happen.
[100:02.39]Okay.
[100:02.71]That ain't fucking happening.
[100:03.57]The dude literally has a homing missile.
[100:05.41]It's like a 5,000 mile per hour homing missile.
[100:07.61]He can't do it.
[100:08.11]I just have to do what I did before.
[100:18.82]Really?
[100:23.22]No shit!
[100:23.66]What happened?
[100:32.25]What?
[100:33.33]What?
[100:38.23]I got hit by like the spray?
[100:44.59]Just run sideways.
[100:46.19]It still hits you.
[100:48.16]Even if you run sideways.
[100:48.90]You have to get lucky.
[100:51.76]You're a bigger target on the horse.
[100:53.00]Alright, so the play is to just run backwards and just let them all run in.
[101:00.54]You have iframes while you summon the horse.
[101:02.20]How many though?
[101:04.21]Hold on, let's find out.
[101:05.01]Interesting.
[101:11.65]Alright, well you don't have iframes when you get off the horse.
[101:19.39]How long do they last?
[101:20.23]Is it the whole time?
[101:23.66]It's actually really interesting, okay?
[101:27.36]No, you don't.
[101:28.10]Okay, you only have iframes when you get on the horse, not off.
[101:30.56]I think I was going to have to do what I did last time.
[101:35.22]And that's just, I had, just get on, just do it on foot.
[101:37.60]It's too much time to think about.
[102:13.59]Alright, so you said I can re-summon them now?
[102:19.84]But not yet.
[102:21.40]But not yet.
[102:42.03]Hot's still alive.
[102:47.94]Okay.
[102:48.54]Ooh, he's staggered, but it's not gonna help me.
[102:51.64]Don't do it.
[102:53.60]Okay, here we go.
[102:54.22]So, wait.
[102:54.62]I can summon them again?
[102:55.32]I don't think I can.
[103:00.59]Nobody's there yet.
[103:20.07]I gotta figure out what a good time to go is.
[103:21.61]Fuck, still alive!
[103:27.86]Shit!
[103:29.04]I just don't know when to go!
[103:30.18]Fuck me, man!
[103:34.01]It's like, when I go in there, he just doesn't move.
[103:40.08]Are they not in the same place?
[103:41.06]I don't see any summoning signs.
[103:42.40]I just have to be really careful and slow.
[103:53.29]This is one of those, like, 15-minute boss encounters.
[103:59.15]I need to get to phase 2.
[104:00.09]Okay, they come back for phase 2.
[104:01.75]Okay.
[104:03.31]Let's keep going with what I was doing.
[104:05.93]You're fucking kidding me, dude.
[104:21.90]Like, please.
[104:23.28]Suck my ass.
[104:40.06]Fuck you!
[104:40.62]You're not even- What the fuck are you doing?
[104:42.86]Oh my god, fuck off already.
[105:31.90]Good
[105:55.42]Oh, fuck you.
[105:56.34]Are you kidding me?
[105:57.30]Oh my god, what a hero!
[106:01.58]What a fucking hero.
[106:02.28]Who did that?
[106:04.60]Who did that?
[106:05.02]I don't know who did that.
[106:14.46]Yes should be the one on the right, not the left.
[106:17.49]I shouldn't have to press left on the D-pad.
[106:20.23]Of course I want to resummon.
[106:21.61]Of course I want to summon the fucking horse.
[106:25.59]This meteor's falling.
[106:29.93]Are we back?
[106:30.37]What's going on?
[106:33.51]Where is he?
[106:33.85]Okay, there he is.
[106:39.58]Holy shit.
[106:40.58]Okay.
[106:51.63]What do those do?
[106:53.36]What do those things do?
[106:54.28]What do the meatballs do?
[106:55.50]Do the meatballs fly out?
[106:58.14]What do the meatballs do?
[107:04.71]I don't... What do the meatballs do?
[107:06.15]Bro, I don't fucking know.
[107:16.63]Are they gonna shoot at me?
[107:22.32]Are you, are you fucking kidding me?
[107:23.96]Are you fucking serious?
[107:24.56]What, they have a countdown timer of like two straight minutes?
[107:33.11]What?
[107:33.25]I'm sitting there waiting for them to do anything and they just fucking sit there.
[107:35.51]MMMM!
[107:50.78]Okay, here's my play.
[107:56.65]Here's the play.
[108:02.29]I'm going to put more mana potions in.
[108:12.95]Let's go.
[108:14.45]We're doing arrows.
[108:15.15]I don't want to fight this guy normally.
[108:19.11]This is a very abnormal fight.
[108:20.69]This is a very weird fight.
[108:25.74]I'm gonna get on top of my horse and I'm gonna fucking- I'm gonna- I'm gonna meatball this guy.
[108:32.86]Jeez Andy, that's right.
[108:38.38]It's gonna be a toasted fucking cheese sandwich with a side of tomato soup.
[108:41.18]Let's do it.
[108:41.80]It's time for some grade A cheese.
[108:45.28]I cheesed so hard I didn't even have to hit him myself.
[109:07.16]I, you know, I really feel... I really feel bad for the, like, 60 points in strength Andes.
[109:15.10]I was like, how the fuck do you do this fight?
[109:18.60]This is probably so hard.
[109:19.48]Because you have to just get up in there.
[109:21.98]And you gotta get up in there.
[109:23.56]Oh, man.
[109:27.67]I just spam summons and got the last hit to make myself feel better.
[109:36.97]It's easy on strength, you just have to do a... I wonder how much damage it does.
[109:41.30]Do 600 damage per hit.
[109:42.66]Oh.
[109:43.82]That's good.
[109:44.58]Alright.
[109:47.84]Should I bring out Oleg too?
[109:50.24]I feel like that's too much mana.
[109:51.90]This is not the time for Oleg.
[109:52.74]Alright, here we go.
[110:15.75]This is bullshit.
[110:16.51]This is bullshit again.
[110:23.79]I... What?
[110:32.24]He didn't do that before!
[110:34.72]dick oh my fucking god I hate this fucking guy he usually does the he does the fucking the frame dropped the fuck
[110:57.33]I don't want to run across the whole game to fight the guy.
[111:01.44]To deal with his trap shooting.
[111:03.76]Oh look, he's got the Orcs Must Die trap that he shoots at you.
[111:08.84]I want to fight the guy.
[111:09.74]Okay.
[111:41.45]Stop!
[111:41.95]What the fuck?
[111:48.05]Alright, get in there!
[111:49.21]Get in there!
[111:50.35]What are you waiting for?
[111:52.49]Get in there and fight him!
[111:54.55]You guys are pissing me off!
[111:56.67]You guys are pissing me off!
[111:58.08]You're pissing me off!
[111:58.94]Get in there!
[111:59.52]I'm a fucking raid leader.
[112:02.70]Yeah, like, why take it so long?
[112:04.00]Fucking get up there and fight him!
[112:46.43]Get off the maiden.
[113:05.37]What are you doing?
[113:05.97]Get away from me!
[113:07.67]Go fight him!
[113:08.25]He's literally in front of you!
[113:17.61]Where'd he go?
[113:22.35]Is he underground?
[113:29.70]Oh, shit!
[113:30.58]No, dude!
[113:31.34]I'm so confused!
[113:32.56]What is this person?
[113:35.15]I thought he was going to phase two.
[113:37.35]I'm so confused.
[113:40.03]I thought he went away.
[113:44.62]She's a healer?
[113:45.38]I'm so fucking confused.
[113:47.54]Oh my god.
[113:48.30]Okay, I'll get him now.
[113:49.24]I'm gonna get him.
[113:51.57]I'll get him.
[113:52.17]I'll get him now.
[113:52.81]Don't worry.
[113:55.91]Stupid ass encounter.
[113:59.45]Watch the- I'll watch the clip after this.
[114:15.58]Honestly, God, I'm about to fucking scream.
[114:18.98]Just kill me already so I can start it again.
[114:29.74]I fucking hate the fact that he's just playing Orcs Must Die.
[114:32.70]Like, this is Dark Souls, okay?
[114:34.23]This isn't Orc... I don't want to be an Orc in Orcs Must Die.
[114:36.73]I just want to fucking go get him.
[114:37.99]I want to fight them.
[114:38.69]I want to fight this guy.
[114:40.27]I don't want to get hit by, like, the spring trap.
[114:43.12]Like, boing!
[114:44.84]Oh, look out!
[114:45.32]Watch out for the spikes that come out on the wall!
[115:04.76]I feel like he's playing tower defense and I'm like one of the little shits.
[115:19.97]He didn't fucking do it.
[115:23.11]He usually does.
[115:24.25]You know what I'm saying?
[115:25.13]You know what I'm fucking saying?
[115:26.57]And now I'm fucked.
[115:38.63]Fucking summon them!
[115:39.95]What the fuck?!
[115:42.21]Oh my god, I hate this.
[115:45.21]Like, just summon them.
[115:46.05]Like, I'm just running over them.
[115:47.59]Oh, I'm so mad right now.
[115:48.94]I didn't even hit him.
[116:08.70]This is the guy that was in the E3 trailer.
[116:11.06]This is what you're gonna do?
[116:11.90]No, no, don't fight the fucking raid leader.
[116:32.57]Fight the other guys.
[116:33.71]Fight the other people.
[116:40.39]Oh shit, I just got really, really sloppy.
[117:04.15]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[117:05.79]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[117:06.91]Don't be an idiot.
[117:11.77]What the fuck are you doing?
[117:19.38]God damn it.
[117:21.90]I'm not locked on.
[117:22.60]I don't even know who the fuck he is.
[117:47.38]This is fucking, this is dumb.
[117:49.54]Okay, what do you want me to do?
[117:52.43]Look at the clip?
[117:53.31]What's the clip?
[118:06.70]Hold on, let me get it.
[118:13.85]This is fucking dumb.
[118:15.33]I hate this.
[118:16.55]Alright, let's go.
[118:17.57]I'm so... I hate this.
[118:19.67]Alright, what are we watching?
[118:20.71]Let's go.
[118:29.11]I... What?
[118:34.82]I hate this.
[118:35.82]I don't want to fight this guy.
[118:36.92]I want to fucking just leave.
[118:45.05]This guy.
[118:46.71]I want- Alright, I'm beating him right now.
[118:48.35]I'm fu- I am so bad.
[118:50.05]It's un-voke-in-believable.
[118:53.25]Ugh.
[118:53.51]Alright.
[119:03.28]That didn't even look real.
[119:04.38]That looked like a fake picture.
[119:06.44]That looked like I put- I pumped that in on purpose.
[119:08.98]I fucked- Alright.
[119:10.18]Oh!
[119:10.40]Stop.
[119:10.76]Shut up.
[119:11.28]Fuck you.
[119:15.29]I'm going to beat him right now.
[119:16.25]This is the one.
[119:16.97]I promise.
[119:17.47]Alright.
[119:23.01]He did the stupid Orcs Must Die move and now I got to get on the... Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[119:45.23]No, dude, get on the fucking horse!
[119:50.64]Why are you still shooting at me?
[119:52.32]There are people in front of you.
[119:53.46]Do you not see?
[120:52.63]Oh!
[121:18.85]Get in there, please.
[121:22.51]Alright, let's go.
[121:55.14]I'm gonna summon some more people.
[121:59.00]There's a stone over- Oh my god!
[122:00.68]Oh my god!
[122:01.16]Oh my god!
[122:01.58]Oh my god!
[122:01.98]Oh my god!
[122:02.22]I thought he was back- I thought he was turning to face the other guy.
[122:06.49]I thought he was turning the other way because the guy was in front of him.
[122:10.89]Oh man, I fucking hate this encounter.
[122:14.25]Oh my god, I hate it.
[122:19.19]This is not even about dodging the guy.
[122:21.27]It's just throw up a bunch of fucking action figures to like the school bully that comes and stomps on him.
[122:35.90]Oh my.
[122:36.08]How do I throw a grenade down on the ground and die?
[122:47.13]Just throw a grenade to the ground, like, because I'm like, I just wasted Estus.
[123:07.36]Even with sorcery too, you were here very early.
[123:10.08]You can do the fun stuff.
[123:11.78]I'm beating this guy out of spite.
[123:13.95]I'm gonna win.
[123:16.98]This guy is such a piece of shit.
[123:19.76]I'm going to beat him out of spite.
[123:29.23]Alright.
[123:30.45]If in ten tries I do not do it... I'm going to leave and we'll come back later.
[123:38.57]Ten tries.
[123:47.85]Ten tries.
[124:24.66]Fuck you!
[124:25.38]Where are they?
[124:27.62]Oh my god.
[124:28.68]Eat.
[124:29.58]Eat it.
[124:30.30]Seriously.
[124:30.92]God fucking damn it.
[124:32.32]Like, I just don't... Like, I fucking hate it.
[125:17.87]Oh my god, the fucking turning radius on this stupid ass horse.
[125:21.37]Like, give me a fucking goddamn break.
[125:40.19]If you were on the ground, how would you avoid that move?
[126:07.94]Help me!
[126:14.23]Help!
[126:27.54]oh my god how the are you charging the house
[127:01.06]Fuck off.
[127:01.68]I'm dead.
[127:04.42]I can't get out of this.
[127:05.06]I can't animation cancel anything.
[127:06.16]I'm stuck.
[127:18.76]How are you still alive, lady?
[127:34.57]Is this lady still alive?
[127:36.67]She's just running behind him.
[127:38.93]What the fuck?
[127:41.27]Alright, I gotta summon these guys.
[127:58.74]I can't take my thing off of him.
[128:00.28]I gotta like get it like here.
[128:05.54]Come on, Lionel.
[128:06.28]Get over here.
[128:07.46]Alright, there's another couple that respawned over here.
[128:15.80]Christ.
[128:17.79]Where are they?
[128:18.29]I can't take the lock on off of them.
[128:19.87]I gotta just run around.
[128:25.25]It's like right here somewhere.
[128:26.41]Okay.
[128:35.69]Turn around and fight!
[128:58.75]Alright, alright, alright, let's go, let's go!
[129:00.03]Let's fight, fight, fight, fight, fight!
[129:01.35]I need more summons, where are they?

[129:08.08]This fucking horse.
[129:10.02]What?
[129:11.48]Oh, what happened?
[129:12.36]What?
[129:13.47]What?
[129:14.71]What?
[129:14.83]Does he land there?
[129:15.81]Does he land there?
[129:17.07]What?
[129:17.89]What does he land?
[129:18.39]Does he land on me?
[129:19.07]Or does he land on the top of the hill?
[129:21.07]Was it the meteor?
[129:21.90]Was that him landing?
[129:23.32]I don't know.
[129:27.68]Oh, the fucking meteor.
[129:43.45]Alright, that's one.
[129:44.07]I have to just keep summoning people?
[129:48.15]Yeah, like, the worst part about that, though, is you need to just ride around like a dickhead.
[129:52.55]And, like, sometimes it's hard to know where they're gonna spawn.
[129:55.54]And turning your back to try to look and see if you're in the right direction is just... You're just gonna get hit by a fucking... One of these dumb things.
[130:06.81]Okay, I need to figure out what the solution is here.
[130:08.97]Because if I get on the horse and he does the fucking purple thing, I'm fucked.
[130:13.05]Like, can I just outrun?
[130:15.27]I don't think I can outrun this.
[130:16.77]Can I?
[130:18.41]It's so hard to tell.
[130:20.99]I think I can.
[130:30.09]Like, everybody?
[130:30.63]I don't know.
[130:35.97]You really?
[130:36.49]Really?
[130:36.73]Like, are you fucking kidding me, dude?
[130:38.37]Did I get everybody?
[131:02.28]I think the lady's up here, right?
[131:06.96]I can't, there it is.
[131:09.66]I can't turn my back.
[131:44.32]Man, come on!
[131:45.42]Is there any more signs?
[132:08.62]Alright, just drive around.
[132:14.38]I don't see any more signs.
[132:16.80]I wonder if they just respawned ago, okay.
[132:19.80]Did I get him?
[132:41.86]More, more, more people!
[132:43.13]More people!
[132:44.95]Oh shit, I lost him.
[132:51.69]God damn it!
[132:52.54]I'm fucking dead.
[133:10.03]I got lucky.
[133:15.35]I don't understand why that move is in this.
[133:18.39]It seems like how the fuck, what are you supposed to do?
[133:21.80]Like what, how do you fucking avoid that move?
[133:24.38]Is it even possible?
[133:25.32]What the hell big that fucking move is?
[133:33.36]I can dodge roll it, but I'm on the fucking horse.
[133:41.20]I'm so dead.
[133:53.25]Alright, up on the hill.
[134:01.44]You're running around doing that.
[134:02.58]Well, I mean, I can't... It's hard to close the gap if I'm going to hit him and do, like, fucking 40 damage.
[134:07.04]Alright, they're over here.
[134:22.71]That move's dumb.
[134:24.77]You all know it.
[134:33.58]That move's dumb.
[134:34.78]That's a dumb move.
[134:40.43]Let me just try to fight him.
[134:42.41]I'm gonna try to get up just to fight him.
[134:45.77]Either bleed or freeze.
[134:48.21]I feel like I can get him to at least phase two.
[134:50.53]I think the bow takes way too long.
[134:52.75]As safe as you are using the bow.
[134:58.17]Look at how long it takes.
[134:59.23]I mean, you don't need to see it, but it's just like one, two, three, four, five.
[135:05.09]It's like you're in such a bad position.
[135:06.96]I'm just going to fight him.
[135:07.64]I'm just going to fucking fight him.
[135:08.36]Let's go.
[135:09.78]I'm just going to get in there and I'm going to kick his ass.
[135:16.25]That's it.
[135:16.67]I'm gonna go kick the shit out of him.
[135:18.35]Face-to-face, one-on-one.
[135:20.26]With a bunch of friends, and that's it.
[135:34.15]Can I outrun this?
[135:35.21]Because getting on the horse is such a bad idea right here.
[135:40.31]Because he'll do the purple shot.
[135:45.33]I can outrun it, alright, I don't need to get on the horse.
[135:48.31]Really?
[135:48.61]Alright, fuck you buddy, let's go.
[136:01.79]Let's all get in there and fight him!
[136:03.09]As one, as a team!
[136:20.29]Nevermind, there's too much going on.
[136:22.29]Too many people.
[136:24.23]Way too many bodies.
[136:26.61]Uh, it's hard.
[136:27.59]There's so many sound effects, it's almost, I can't tell who's even doing a move.
[136:35.41]You're supposed to get on the horse.
[136:36.39]Alright, how many attempts is that?
[136:40.28]Before I just like, never come back to this shitty piece of fucking garbage fight ever again.
[136:48.70]Three?
[136:49.08]Okay.
[136:50.44]Just gotta do this seven more fucking times.
[136:53.28]Nice.
[137:14.06]Fucking hate this.
[137:14.86]Just kill me.
[137:16.46]Like, what?
[137:22.04]Somebody said this took them four days to do.
[137:25.16]What the fuck?
[137:33.07]No, that counts.
[137:33.77]That counts.
[137:34.87]That counts.
[137:44.12]I'll summon Oleg.
[137:45.26]I'm gonna summon Oleg and let him get one hit killed.
[137:59.32]Honestly, I think I'm gonna fight this boss without the HUD, too, by the way.
[138:01.88]You know what I mean?
[138:03.30]Like, I'm just gonna turn the HUD off.
[138:04.40]Because, like, what's all this info on the screen?
[138:05.98]I don't want to fucking see it. ...
[138:46.06]47 fucking damage.
[138:53.93]Why did I do so...
[139:14.43]Dude, will you stop fucking swinging?
[139:16.73]Oh my god!
[139:25.60]Is this like a fucking movie I'm watching or do I get to fight the guy?
[139:46.58]Oleg, get out here!
[139:49.32]What?
[139:49.72]I have to be off the horse?
[139:51.92]How come I can't summon?
[139:53.20]What?
[139:55.33]Why not?
[139:58.65]I can't summon?
[140:05.21]I can't summon him here.
[140:07.55]Everyone yelling at me to summon Oleg.
[140:09.15]I can't.
[140:14.66]I got a better idea.
[140:17.16]Alright.
[140:18.88]New plan.
[140:20.27]New plan.
[140:20.59]For the last five attempts.
[140:23.45]My hand goes through my monitor.
[140:30.57]New plan.
[140:33.56]Do I have?
[140:33.96]No.
[140:40.10]This is not going to cut it.
[140:42.10]This might though.
[140:43.37]Hold on.
[140:46.23]Maybe I should just sit there and just like, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[140:50.89]These things happen quick.
[140:53.61]Swift ones.
[140:54.10]I don't think anything else is worth doing.
[141:01.18]I'm honest.
[141:09.09]I think I just eat.
[141:10.77]I think I just have.
[141:11.87]Yeah.
[141:12.55]I mean, I'm going to lose, but...
[141:20.22]I'm just going to be an absolute coward.
[141:25.00]And we're just going to Swift Glintstone and fucking run around and just pick them.
[141:32.62]Yeah, I only have one Sacred Tear on these flasks, which is really awful.
[141:37.83]If I can't get it, I'm just not ready for it.
[141:41.45]Activate Rune Arcs?
[141:42.25]Yeah, but if I die with a Rune Arc, isn't that just going to delete the Rune Arc?
[141:45.37]Wow, I wouldn't want to use that at a boss.
[141:46.81]I'm not comfortable getting 50% of his health down.
[141:55.00]Anything besides the bow is probably too short range.
[141:58.94]I'll try it.
[142:01.38]It's just a humanity.
[142:03.58]I cannot use my summons, but they're not allowed in that area.
[142:07.50]I can summon the people on the ground, but the hardest part for me so far has been... Alright, you summon everybody.
[142:13.66]You do the Orcs Must Die bullshit in the first fucking minute and a half of the fight.
[142:17.53]I'm getting on my horse.
[142:18.97]I gotta go around and touch the summoning signs, but sometimes I'll lose the lock on.
[142:24.69]And then he just... I can't even fucking see him.
[142:28.34]Alright.
[142:31.12]I'm gonna just be a wuss.
[142:33.16]And we're gonna swift glint stone him over and over again.
[142:39.09]In fact, I'm gonna put the sword away.
[142:40.95]I'm not even gonna use it.
[142:41.57]I'm just gonna hold this in two hands.
[142:51.96]Go take a CSGO surf break.
[142:54.04]Alright, I got five more attempts before I'm turning around and running away from this bullshit.
[143:05.62]I'm just gonna stay the fuck away from him and just be very, very cautious.
[143:11.22]I only have two heals though, which is bad.
[143:29.67]I don't need to talk to him?
[143:30.47]Oh, okay.
[143:32.53]It's good to know.
[143:43.56]Use the buffs bow and spam the bow.
[143:47.04]I have to stand in the circle, which that's just guaranteed to die.
[143:50.62]I have to stand inside of that little buff circle.
[143:53.50]It doesn't stay on me.
[144:08.08]I know I'm not supposed to be doing this.
[144:09.68]I'm underleveled.
[144:10.74]I know.
[144:12.12]I'm undergeared.
[144:13.60]I'm coming in here at the wrong time.
[144:15.94]I know.
[144:16.46]I know I'm missing flasks.
[144:24.93]I know.
[144:25.39]But it's called being a stubborn little shit.
[144:28.91]I know.
[144:46.57]Do I actually have to be on the fucking horse?
[144:52.31]Get out of the way!
[144:58.29]You fucking serious dude.
[144:59.88]Like, fuck off.
[145:00.72]I can't.
[145:02.60]Alright.
[145:04.00]Eat my ass.
[145:04.72]I'm serious.
[145:27.81]I'm not even fucking kidding.
[145:29.97]Yeah, it's bow or nothing.
[145:40.36]Do it very slowly.
[145:46.22]Slow.
[145:46.56]I'm just going to find the other summoning sign.
[145:49.30]Right here.
[145:49.64]I don't know if I got it or not.
[145:54.13]It's so fucking hard to tell.
[146:00.01]Where is he?
[146:01.97]I don't know.
[146:02.31]Oh god.
[146:02.69]God.
[146:02.95]God.
[146:03.21]God.
[146:03.47]God.
[146:03.75]God.
[146:04.01]God.
[146:43.63]What the fuck, dude?
[146:45.26]What, are you curving around his fucking body?
[146:48.00]What was that?
[147:08.53]Thank you.
[147:39.51]The opportunity is so small to hurt him
[147:49.10]Do I just have to run around and just don't even attack them?
[147:52.93]Just get the shots that I can get off and then have the summons hurt them?
[147:55.55]They keep spawning, I guess.
[147:58.59]I don't fucking know.
[148:13.76]Any more summons?
[148:23.62]We're doing coward play right here.
[148:25.31]I don't care.
[148:37.70]This is real coward gameplay right now.
[148:42.68]I have no shame.
[148:51.53]Oh my god!
[148:52.97]I thought he was aiming that way.
[148:54.07]I didn't think it was going to come this way.
[148:55.15]Alright, more summoning symbols.
[149:10.05]Where are they?
[149:14.85]Thought I saw one over here.
[149:26.09]No, fuck off!
[149:26.85]There's three people next to you, dude!
[149:28.19]Fucking get out of here!
[149:54.30]Summoning signs!
[150:16.96]Oh shit, oh shit.
[150:39.20]Where is everybody?
[150:48.87]Why he baited me?
[150:49.73]He fucking actually baited me.
[150:52.91]That was actual bait right there.
[150:55.29]Okay, watch out for the meteor.
[150:56.25]Meteor, meteor, meteor, meteor.
[150:57.39]Watch out for the meteor.
[150:58.05]Where's the meteor?
[150:59.51]Where is it?
[151:01.69]Where's the meteor?
[151:04.29]Oh my god!
[151:27.71]I'm so scared.
[151:28.41]I don't want to go close to him because of the meatballs.
[151:36.07]Dude, I'm terrified.
[151:43.68]I'm going to shoot the bow and the meatballs are going to kill me.
[151:54.62]Fuck you!
[152:08.16]What killed the wolf?
[152:09.96]Why did the wolf die?
[152:12.16]Come help!
[152:13.26]Get on a horse!
[152:15.66]Dude, I fucking can't with that goddamn move!
[152:22.44]I was- Slow and steady, if you're on the- you can't.
[152:32.11]Cause he's gonna just do that fucking move and pull you in.
[152:45.95]Don't use the horse.
[152:46.75]Do you- do you understand how fast I'm gonna fucking die if I don't use the horse?
[152:53.23]I have fucking 25 points in dexterity.
[152:55.93]I'm in trouble if I get off that fucking horse.
[153:10.79]The only way that I can do that off the horse is if I just try to learn all of it.
[153:14.65]But that's going to be fucking impossible.
[153:17.90]I wonder how many people beat this off the horse.
[153:19.48]I feel like they're not supposed to.
[153:23.66]Because he's on a horse.
[153:24.52]And we've already seen.
[153:25.66]If somebody's on a horse.
[153:26.66]Get on a horse.
[153:27.38]I just like.
[153:34.17]I freaked out.
[153:37.71]I freaked out.
[153:38.35]I freaked out.
[153:38.71]I freaked out.
[154:02.41]God, dude, you've got five people around you.
[154:53.85]Alright, summon!
[155:01.28]What the fuck?
[155:03.44]That's worked every other time!
[155:04.78]Just running, sprinting for the diagonal.
[155:08.29]Alright, how many is that?
[155:10.43]How many is that?
[155:11.41]How many is that?
[155:13.17]I usually sprint diagonally and I don't get hit.
[155:17.79]I'm gonna cut it short.
[155:18.95]I don't think I can do it without more upgrades.
[155:23.81]I don't think I can, I don't think I can do it without upgrades.
[155:26.69]I need at least like a plus three flask.
[155:29.73]And... I just want to fucking throw a grenade at this guy, you know what I mean?
[155:38.53]I have a plus one flask.
[155:39.95]What am I, am I a fucking idiot?
[155:41.15]Like, I have to drink like six extra potions!
[155:54.95]Thank you.
[156:14.99]Still don't understand that move.
[156:16.33]I just don't get it.
[156:19.32]You can't avoid it on foot, and if you get on the horse, you might get fucking hit by the purple thing if you get off the horse again.
[156:28.54]I can't dodge through it because it goes behind me.
[156:31.65]I don't understand that move.
[156:34.04]Alright, so when I get on the horse, if he does that move, and I outrun it with the horse, and he does the purple charge beam, he's going to hit me with it.
[156:41.99]He's going to fucking hit me with it.
[156:43.06]What?
[156:43.78]What the fuck were they thinking?
[157:18.14]so
[157:45.79]Oh my god.
[158:22.88]I don't have a fucking regular ass weapon out.
[158:34.59]What are you thinking, bro?
[158:35.87]What are you doing?
[158:36.43]I don't have a fucking regular weapon out.
[159:03.84]Don't lose block on.
[159:21.32]I don't know why I keep... I'm freaking out about that one now.
[159:35.96]Alright, summon.
[159:38.86]There's a couple up here.
[159:39.62]At least there should be, right?
[159:43.58]No?
[159:57.80]Where is it?
[159:59.49]It's back here somewhere.
[160:03.83]Where are they?
[160:04.69]Over there.
[160:17.62]Back there.
[160:29.44]Fuck you!
[160:30.46]Fuck you!
[160:31.14]I can't avoid that!
[160:31.93]I have to get hit by it every time!
[160:43.72]Dude, no!
[160:44.74]God damn it, the fucking turning radius!
[160:47.26]Oh my god, I hate this fucking thing.
[160:48.94]I hate this.
[160:50.00]I fucking hate this fight.
[160:52.50]If you could even call it that.
[160:54.06]If you could even call it that.
[161:00.23]I like, I turned, but the horse went like, like, that way.
[161:25.83]That one was going pretty well, too.
[161:27.11]It's just you get like- if you get like caught for a tenth of a second... I just don't- I don't- I don't want to be a fucking mile away from a goddamn boss.
[161:33.92]Like, fucking do it- See what I mean?
[161:40.10]He didn't do the fucking thing!
[161:41.56]He didn't do the thing!
[161:42.58]He did the purple shit instead!
[161:45.16]And he did the purple shit again!
[161:49.52]And now he's gonna do the- I hate him.
[161:52.06]I fucking hate him.
[161:54.28]This guy gets a capital.
[162:07.40]Is somebody invading the game?
[162:10.50]Why is there a red guy?
[162:50.73]Alright, summon it.
[163:10.88]Right there?
[163:19.67]Go back there.
[163:30.16]Get it?
[163:36.32]That is such a dogshit fucking move.
[164:04.11]Gotta try to jump at the right time.
[164:13.66]You running circles around him instead of running away?
[164:15.72]But if I run away I lose the lock on and I turn that way and it fucking sucks.
[164:26.77]Oh, that's close.
[164:38.92]Uh-oh.
[164:48.84]Oh, god!
[165:04.59]And he's also faster than me, too.
[165:06.19]That's another thing.
[165:08.65]If he pursues me, he's going to close the gap.
[165:10.01]Because he's faster. ...
[165:30.98]where are those summoning things over there fuck you this boss is from knack 3 they should have kept him there
[166:18.36]I don't know.
[166:19.24]Summoning signs back behind me, I think.
[166:22.46]I'm not going to beat him.
[166:28.40]I'm going to back.
[166:29.25]I'm going to go over here.
[166:35.59]Really stupid idea, but whatever.
[166:42.34]I don't know.
[166:42.72]I don't see anything.
[166:43.92]Oh my goodness, this is bad.
[166:46.46]What?
[166:46.64]Where the fuck did you come from?
[166:49.44]Well, do something.
[166:50.18]What?
[166:50.42]Hey!
[166:51.56]What was that?
[166:56.86]Ah, I'm dead.
[166:58.64]Alright, I give up.
[167:00.12]I give up.
[167:00.82]This guy sucks.
[167:01.50]I'll be back later.
[167:14.30]He's going in the air.
[167:15.42]Alright.
[167:21.22]I don't know where it is.
[167:22.64]Where the fuck is it?
[167:23.36]I don't know.
[167:26.88]I don't know.
[167:38.73]I can't do anything.
[167:39.99]I have to just run around.
[167:41.05]I can't even fight the guy.
[167:45.05]I just have to sit here and stare at him.
[167:46.45]Yeah, just go fight him.
[167:57.36]Fuck off, everybody.
[167:58.10]Go fight him.
[167:59.52]I'll watch.
[168:00.06]I'll watch this stupid ass thing.
[168:01.71]Go fight him.
[168:03.73]Eventually, maybe somebody will do enough chip damage where I can fucking be outta here.
[168:22.84]I'll stay all the fucking way back here.
[168:24.32]I don't give a shit.
[168:27.24]Is anyone hurting him?
[168:28.96]Oh, there we go!
[168:29.72]193!
[168:30.50]You see that?
[168:36.64]Someone will kill him.
[168:38.12]Somebody will kill this guy.
[168:44.97]Are there any more summoning soap signs?
[168:46.49]I don't see any more.
[169:32.71]Oh, shit.
[169:44.74]Oh, I can't see.
[169:51.64]What?
[169:52.84]The fuck happened?
[169:58.55]Where did that come from?
[170:00.15]Where did that come from?
[170:04.49]Oh, this little fucker.
[170:08.08]I'm so upset at this.
[170:11.86]You gotta be fucking kidding me.

[173:11.79]Okay.
[173:24.10]So.
[173:27.36]I need to find...
[173:30.94]I think I'm gonna go here.
[173:31.70]Am I still frame dropping?
[173:35.38]What the f- That's also pissing me off.
[173:38.32]Why am I dropping so many frames?
[173:40.62]I have- I have fucking gigabit, thousand, thousand internet connection.
[173:44.77]What is going on?
[173:48.97]My internet connection can't get better than this.
[174:03.92]Like, I physically can't get a better connection.
[174:06.86]Look at how sweaty I am.
[174:08.10]Holy shit.
[174:10.68]Why do you look like this?
[174:11.50]Because I'm deranged right now, okay?
[174:16.33]I know what we can do.
[174:17.09]I have an idea.
[174:17.71]Let's go kill a dragon.
[174:21.03]Let's go kill the dragon that's over here.
[174:23.77]That's good.
[174:31.82]That's something I can do.
[174:34.21]That sounds like fun.
[174:34.87]Okay.
[174:43.06]Because I know I can kill the dragon.
[174:49.10]It's been a while.
[174:50.04]Let's go for it.
[174:55.35]We do a BRB.
[174:56.29]If I don't beat the dragon in three tries, I will BRB.
[175:23.57]Oh my god, that's the vendor.
[175:25.41]Oh my god, that's the vendor.
[175:26.71]I just was like mad, so I just attacked a guy.
[175:30.23]No, don't kill the vendor, please.
[175:37.96]Okay, jeez.
[175:38.92]I don't want to kill the vendor.
[175:43.84]What do you got?
[175:45.04]Two imps?
[175:54.21]Crafting?
[175:55.41]Oh shit, alright.
[175:56.91]You got some good shit.
[175:59.76]There's a note here.
[176:01.76]I'm going to mark this because that's actually pretty cool.
[176:05.83]Alright, I'm going to mark this.
[176:10.03]Like a vendor.
[176:10.79]What would be vendor?
[176:11.67]Probably this.
[176:20.39]Next time you fight that boss, don't use the party finder.
[176:22.79]It's full of morons.
[176:29.18]Stop.
[176:33.30]Is it safe for me to drop down from here or am I gonna die?
[176:36.82]The party finder.
[176:38.48]Who's this?
[176:42.97]What's going on?
[176:44.35]Who the fuck are you?
[176:46.19]What's this guy doing here?
[176:53.88]I gotta play Dark Souls again.
[176:56.22]I've been literally riding around playing anti-tower defense the whole game.
[177:04.41]I've been on the horse for three hours trying to fight this stupid fucking random ass encounter.
[177:24.55]Christ dude what the fuck I'm gonna die
[177:45.78]Who the fuck is this guy?
[177:47.22]What are you doing over here?
[177:51.58]What the?
[177:51.94]What is happening?
[177:53.86]Who is this guy?
[177:54.56]Get away from me!
[177:58.52]I'm trying to play!
[177:59.48]What is that?
[178:07.69]Celestial dude?
[178:13.25]Carry out absolution at the Church of Vows?
[178:17.90]Reversing all antagonizations?
[178:20.08]What is this?
[178:27.46]So I bring that to the turtle and I can reverse people that are angry?
[178:30.62]Interesting.
[178:34.80]Okay.
[178:40.77]Okay, that's weird.
[178:42.19]It makes NPCs not mad at you.
[178:44.01]Ah, alright.
[178:45.63]Uh, okay, I need to go... No, what's the fastest way to get there?
[178:52.46]Main gate, probably.
[179:00.12]You still have plus one flask.
[179:01.78]I know, but like, I don't... This world is so huge that it's like...
[179:06.84]I need to, I don't know where they are.
[179:08.06]I think they're at, like, churches, but, like, I need to, where is it?
[179:11.70]I need to find a church.
[179:17.68]I'll get it soon, don't worry.
[179:22.60]I feel like I've come across random churches, maybe.
[179:24.73]Like, would they be on the map?
[179:26.47]Like that, right?
[179:28.99]So, like, in here?
[179:30.11]Like, but I feel like I've gotten that one already.
[179:35.05]Did I get this?
[179:35.75]This is a church.
[179:37.51]Technically.
[179:40.97]No dragon?
[179:41.43]No, no, no.
[179:41.71]I'm going for the dragon right now.
[179:42.55]I just want to get a better place to do it.
[179:46.04]There's a big old... I got to go this.
[179:52.40]Can I jump over this?
[179:55.20]What's the best actual way to go to get here from here?
[179:57.38]Probably one of these.
[179:58.58]Maybe this one.
[179:59.13]Oh, that's a cave.
[180:02.47]This one here?
[180:05.30]As I can jump, I'm trying to just not die, because you die from the fall damage there.
[180:11.33]Yeah, it's this one here.
[180:12.27]Alright, let me go kill this dragon.
[180:16.55]Let me try to.
[180:16.99]See if I can do it.
[180:41.83]Frames are still dropping.
[180:43.17]I have no idea what's going on.
[180:47.29]That should not be happening.
[180:49.05]But it apparently is.
[180:50.23]I don't know if it's a Twitch server problem.
[180:52.63]Or I don't know if it's a connection.
[180:53.87]My connection problem.
[180:56.63]But I don't know.
[180:58.69]It's weird.
[181:00.59]I'm going to start connecting to a different Twitch server.
[181:03.21]I feel like the one I'm connecting to is like a piece of shit.
[181:05.81]So I'm going to connect to something else.
[181:09.10]Next stream, I will connect to a different ingest server.
[181:12.98]I feel like that's part of the problem.
[181:14.22]Okay.
[181:18.60]Let me see if I can kill him.
[181:21.20]Here we go.
[181:33.61]Do it!
[181:58.15]What was that?
[182:30.53]Is he gonna- I see this.
[183:01.02]Excuse me!
[183:01.32]I don't like this place, but I don't like fighting him here.
[183:08.07]I don't want to fight him against the wall!
[183:29.44]Yeah, he's gonna move.
[183:30.50]This is a fucking terrible place to fight him.
[183:35.36]Thank you for moving.
[183:35.96]I appreciate it.
[184:01.46]What are you doing?
[184:01.86]What are you doing?
[184:03.26]What's he doing?
[184:11.79]What are you doing?
[184:12.23]You're being a weirdo.
[184:14.31]What are you doing?
[184:14.85]Why do you think he's such a weirdo?
[184:17.31]What?
[184:38.51]you
[185:08.59]What are you doing?
[185:16.55]Not against the wall.
[185:17.29]Get out of there.
[186:14.41]Oh!
[186:58.08]Watch out for the giant slug!
[187:01.80]Where'd he go?
[187:04.55]I'm not gonna fight a giant slug right now.
[187:12.72]Hey!
[187:12.96]Alright, I'm good.
[187:28.25]Oh, shit!
[187:55.11]You motherfucker.
[188:00.51]What happened?
[188:01.03]I jumped?
[188:01.43]I jumped twice?
[188:03.21]What happened?
[188:03.61]He killed me in one hit.
[188:04.98]What happened?
[188:05.78]What?
[188:07.30]What happened?
[188:08.00]I jumped?
[188:08.76]I double jumped and hit him?
[188:10.46]I hit my head on the ceiling?
[188:12.10]What?
[188:13.18]I died in one hit?
[188:16.69]What?
[188:19.28]That's... No.
[188:21.24]No.
[188:23.06]No.
[188:26.94]He landed.
[188:27.66]He landed, but I like jumped and he landed and I touched his like body.
[188:32.19]That was so sad.
[188:35.67]One hit.
[188:38.19]Oh my god.
[188:38.95]I'm so defeated right now.
[188:41.02]Like what the fuck?
[188:44.24]What?
[189:01.35]I guess I'm gonna just, somebody said be aggressive.
[189:03.79]Yeah, I was trying to be slow and smart.
[189:09.08]But fuck man, if I can die in one hit, am I like not supposed to be fighting this guy either?
[189:16.62]Go!
[189:17.02]How is, what's going on?
[189:23.09]I've landed on this rock fucking a hundred times!
[189:26.29]What?! !
[189:32.13]That doesn't count.
[189:36.03]I've jumped on that rock three thousand times in a row!
[189:39.78]Wha- what the fuck is going on?
[189:42.40]Where did you just put me?
[189:43.24]No, it doesn't count.
[189:48.10]Jeremy, you are so stressed, take a break.
[189:52.67]That was so- that was horse shit!
[189:56.39]Why did I die in one hit?
[190:01.09]I feel like I've gotten hit by that move.
[190:02.25]Okay, so tell me what the fuck is going on right now.
[190:04.67]Because literally, I've... Is it the double jump?
[190:08.35]Okay, I guess I... Whatever, let's go.
[190:11.29]I'm just going to be super aggressive, and if it gets me killed, whatever.
[190:17.68]Go directly south of the dragon?
[190:23.26]Right here?
[190:24.02]Fine, I'll do that.
[190:36.81]I wanna see- look, alright, I understand that you wanna shoot a whole map full of fucking magic, but like, can I please see my fucking map?
[190:45.98]What's this?
[191:07.62]Oh, thank God.
[191:11.56]I don't even fucking think about it.
[191:14.98]You're pushing by buttons right now, game.
[191:28.53]A little- there's a little island here.
[191:30.53]I just- you said there's one here?
[191:31.65]Alright, save me.
[191:57.76]Did I beat the dragon?
[191:58.64]No, he killed me in one hit.
[192:03.20]I have full health.
[192:05.12]Which leads me to believe that I either got, like, Omega stomped.
[192:10.02]Or I, like, wasn't... I'm still not supposed to fight that guy.
[192:14.93]Alright, well, you said go to the island?
[192:16.13]What's on the island?
[192:19.80]I mean, it's Lily.
[192:22.17]What's the island?
[192:23.35]This island?
[192:27.41]Is there a flask thing on one of these islands?
[192:30.93]Far to the south.
[192:34.24]You mean like all the way down here?
[192:35.82]Like way south.
[192:38.54]Oh.
[192:43.16]I'm going to go all the way down there?
[192:44.14]Okay.
[192:46.42]Okay.
[192:50.81]This is crazy.
[192:51.55]There's a whole nother continent.
[192:52.55]Alright, go this way.
[193:02.63]I thought this was like the end of the world.
[193:03.93]There's another way to go?
[193:04.79]That's fucking ridiculous.
[193:18.71]What's back here?
[193:20.25]I feel like I've done this part.
[193:22.55]Let me just check.
[193:26.99]Starlight Shards.
[193:29.82]Okay.
[193:46.44]Alright, so what am I looking for down here?
[193:52.75]Is it gonna kill me?
[193:53.27]Hope not.
[193:58.79]Okay.
[194:00.42]Southern Island is pretty easy.
[194:05.40]Oh, you mean you want me to... Oh, was this the way for you guys to get me away from the hard shit that's making me want to fucking smash my webcam into 100 pieces?
[194:17.27]Oh, okay.
[194:26.28]Alright, hold on.
[194:36.61]Alright, I can still be on the horse.
[194:39.17]I'm gonna get to one of those, uh, gray spaces.
[194:52.70]Alright, give me a bonfire so I can take a quick break.
[195:17.52]Instead of smashing my fucking head against a wall fighting a boss I'm not supposed to be fighting.
[195:22.42]Who has a shit, shit encounter.
[195:28.58]I'm gonna go down here and I'm gonna have a great time.
[195:35.38]Okay, here we go.
[195:37.08]I've been holding my P. I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[195:46.42]Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[195:50.46]Alright, I'll be right back.

[203:31.13]I gotta get all these markers.
[203:32.53]Can I just clear all the markers that I have?
[203:35.63]I feel like this should be a fast way to do this.
[203:37.27]Can I just, like... Okay.
[203:41.30]Because if I'm gonna be down here, I don't want these on the map.
[203:50.38]Okay.
[203:53.90]Uh, this way.
[203:59.32]Back in.
[204:12.59]A new NPC.
[204:13.57]Hello?
[204:15.28]Is somebody there?
[204:16.72]Might I bend your ear for a moment, please?
[204:18.86]My name is Irina.
[204:20.64]I've escaped from Castle Moria to the south.
[204:23.52]No, that's Lanya.
[204:27.18]I can't be sure what it is.
[204:29.26]My eyesight's been weak since birth, you see.
[204:31.96]But I swear I heard frightful howling from all over.
[204:35.52]My good father secreted me out the castle, but decided himself to stay.
[204:41.22]Red nose you can just see like that so all the anger is hanging out right now.
[204:48.85]It's like here I Look fucking trashed.
[204:54.39]I look shit-faced.
[204:56.87]I Look like about like seven beers today.
[204:59.55]Like I look trashed.
[205:00.79]I
[205:03.28]The servants are full of wrath.
[205:05.74]They've since come for every one of the companions I escaped with.
[205:09.28]They haven't spared a soul.
[205:11.18]I fear it's no different at Castle Morn.
[205:13.20]Castle Morn.
[205:14.00]Would you mind taking a letter to my father?
[205:16.02]My soul wishes that he escaped.
[205:18.32]Even if his honor should be the price.
[205:19.84]Take a letter?
[205:20.44]Please.
[205:22.18]I just want him to be safe.
[205:23.90]Okay.
[205:25.22]Uh, yeah.

[205:27.12]I'll deliver the letter.
[205:28.36]Then please.
[205:30.85]Rina's letter.
[205:31.65]I'll try.
[205:33.41]I can't promise I won't read the note, though.
[205:42.32]Can't promise I'm not going to read it.
[205:45.30]What does it say?
[205:50.30]Ah.
[205:51.79]Gorgeous silicon handkerchief, lightly stained with blood.
[205:54.15]Words can be made out with.
[205:55.47]That's not what's on the letter.
[205:56.99]That's what it's made out of.
[206:01.33]Oh, read it.
[206:03.07]What if it says like, assassinate the guy that gave you this letter?
[206:05.54]What if it says that?
[206:16.72]Fucking hate that encounter.
[206:18.04]I feel like, I feel like Happy Gilmore right now.
[206:22.22]Like, I'm just like still mad about it.
[206:25.28]I'm still so fucking mad about it.
[206:29.31]I even like took a minute I like put some water in my face and I was just like just relax man.
[206:34.65]We're good.
[206:44.12]This looks like it's gonna be tricky.
[206:45.90]I think it's time to call in a little bit of support here.
[206:49.09]Oleg the Commander!
[206:57.36]Nice.
[206:58.48]Okay.
[207:00.62]Alright.
[207:02.70]Big moves from Oleg.
[207:15.19]Okay.
[207:17.15]Oleg.
[207:19.03]Attack.
[207:21.20]It's actually going to be kind of... Alright.
[207:22.62]Wait, wait.
[207:22.96]Clear it out.
[207:23.30]Clear it out.
[207:23.64]Clear it out.
[207:24.00]Clear it out.
[207:24.40]Clear it out.

[207:28.90]No bullshit.
[207:30.72]Bullshit is happening.
[207:32.82]Bullshit is currently happening.
[207:37.30]I love this guy.
[207:37.92]I'm getting this guy a plus 10.
[207:43.01]I'm getting this guy a plus 10.
[207:46.07]You're a little late.
[207:48.97]Comedy's back.

[207:50.15]We're back.
[207:50.69]We're back.
[207:51.25]We're back.
[207:53.01]Hey, we're back.
[207:58.76]Alright, and so instead of me going like this... Watch my eyes, alright?
[208:08.83]Next time that I'm in a fight and I'm really unhappy about the fight, watch what my eyes do.
[208:14.22]They go like this.
[208:18.00]Like, I look up into my brain.
[208:20.72]That's how you know that I'm not having a great time.
[208:23.30]Because I go like...
[208:26.42]I do like the Undertaker eyes.
[208:33.76]Is that an NPC or is that a... I got to fight.
[208:35.81]Let's find out.
[208:37.67]Oleg.
[208:37.99]You know what to do.
[208:43.03]What's wrong with this guy?
[208:50.58]Oh.
[209:05.22]Get him before he gets the sword out.
[209:08.35]Oh, yeah.
[209:10.41]Good team.
[209:16.47]I definitely feel like I am a little bit leveled for this area.
[209:22.66]Morningstar.
[209:23.46]Cool.
[209:27.16]Anything on this side?
[209:27.80]No.
[209:30.36]Oleg seems pretty basic.
[209:31.36]Yeah, he is.
[209:34.52]He's a new enemy.
[209:35.22]Oh yeah, let's go.
[209:44.89]Let's just wipe the floor with this area.
[209:46.51]Okay, I thought that was Oleg for a second.
[209:51.90]I was like, what are you doing, man?
[209:54.80]Why is he only doing 25 damage?
[209:56.04]I feel like he should be doing way more.
[210:22.35]Ooh, mighty shot.
[210:26.01]Mighty shot.
[210:33.94]What else we got?
[210:36.64]Is Oleg gone?
[210:37.12]Okay, Oleg is gone.
[210:39.72]I gotta stop biting my lip.
[210:48.13]Are we still dropping frames still?
[210:57.10]Yeah.
[210:58.68]What the fuck, man?
[211:01.74]I don't know what's going on with this bullshit.
[211:03.76]It's annoying.
[211:05.74]Why?
[211:09.59]Everyone on Twitch... Wait, is it a... Wait, are you serious?
[211:11.79]Are you guys serious?
[211:26.56]Really?

[211:30.48]Oh, shit.
[211:31.24]Alright.
[211:31.58]I feel fine then.

[212:39.26]Who the fuck are you?
[212:44.78]Knights Calvary?
[212:46.76]Oh, let's kill this guy first try because I'm probably so overleveled for this area.

[217:20.21]And then they keep doing it.
[217:22.05]They lose over and over again.
[217:23.07]And then you kind of just have to reach over at some point.
[217:25.33]And you fucking alt-tab.
[217:26.29]But you hit, like, the escape button.
[217:28.31]And it's just like... And it's just like, dude, I'm sorry.

[217:42.77]And just be like, take a second and just, like, think about what's happening right now.
[217:46.42]And they go look in the mirror, and their nose is like a big fucking red nose.
[217:55.62]You gotta start like playing something, like music or something.
[217:59.55]Just start playing like, I don't know, like fucking Party in the USA behind them.
[218:02.59]And they'll be like, Hands up, they're playing.
[218:06.47]What's going on behind me?
[218:07.89]And then you got them.
[218:09.25]You got them out.

[220:20.10]Siege of Castle Morne.
[220:21.26]A lone hero fights for his vengeance, only to fall at the hand of Lord Godfrey.
[220:28.50]We killed that motherfucker, so we'll be fine.
[220:35.20]Berserk.

[221:19.60]That's the theme song to Berserk!
[221:21.22]Oh my god, we have fake fans here.
[221:24.53]Do we actually have fake fans here?
[221:26.91]Like you're not a real fan?
[221:31.03]Everyone's telling me Berserk, Berserk, Berserk and then I do the Berserk theme song and all of a sudden I'm like the weird cat puke guy.
[221:38.60]I wonder if I can use this.
[221:52.75]Damn it, I can't.
[221:54.33]Shit.
[221:55.23]Alright, well, whatever.
[221:59.39]I am going to use... Let's keep that one on.

[222:02.55]Alright, so.
[222:04.35]Uh, where we at?

[222:46.03]Is this a boss?
[222:46.67]Hey, sorry to interrupt.
[222:55.62]Alright, don't get cocky just because I have like extra levels for this dumb area.
[222:59.29]It's not dumb.
[222:59.91]I actually like this place.
[223:25.02]You got health.
[223:30.37]Irma and the red nose of anger.
[223:33.77]I'm just like kind of like... I look like I made out of wax right now.
[223:38.63]Sometimes I look like a wax figurine.
[223:40.43]I'm sorry.
[223:41.09]It's like shaving and sweating and like I have my cortisol levels have been high.
[223:45.60]I've just been like fucking angry.
[224:01.10]OK, there's something here.
[224:03.58]It's going to be like a major boss here.
[224:20.75]What was that?
[224:23.65]Did you hear that?
[224:26.36]I just bumped my elbow?
[224:32.02]What's this weird sound I keep hearing?
[224:33.50]What's going on?
[224:51.57]Fire grease.
[224:52.17]I can make a bunch of those too.
[225:01.29]Remember, why do you kill so many people?
[225:09.97]There's a better way than just violence.
[225:12.35]Um... Okay, well here he is.
[225:14.72]It's, uh, pumpkin.
[225:17.54]It's a pumpkin head guy.
[225:20.91]Guy didn't even get to stand up.
[225:36.00]Have you tried talking to the monsters?
[225:40.48]Yeah, I've been going... Like, waving.
[225:43.77]And they don't do anything.
[225:46.19]I keep going like this.
[225:48.17]And I don't understand.
[225:48.95]I keep going like...
[225:53.11]And I'm just trying to wave to him.
[225:54.47]I don't know.
[225:54.79]Nobody seems to be like trying to communicate.
[225:57.23]I can't get it.
[226:01.00]They keep walking like kind of forward.
[226:03.24]And like I don't know.
[226:03.82]Maybe I hit them in like the face sometimes accidentally.
[226:06.28]It's not my fault.
[226:06.90]Like I'm just trying to say hi.
[226:07.74]I'm just trying to fucking wave at that guy.
[226:14.01]Like they're trying to get his attention.
[226:16.49]This game's fucking stupid.
[226:17.57]Like I'm trying to wave at people.
[226:18.65]I'm trying not to hit anybody.
[226:23.06]That actually kind of pisses me off that you can't, like, just, like, you know, talk to them.
[226:27.15]Okay.
[226:29.91]At least the title of this stream is correct.
[226:33.19]For the first time in five streams, right?
[226:35.35]Oh, hey!
[226:41.34]Hey, dude!
[226:45.40]Oh, not again!
[226:46.32]I told you it keeps happening to me!
[226:52.74]I'm trying to wave.
[227:06.91]Stop.
[227:17.81]Hit him with your sword.
[227:20.17]Wave at him harder.
[227:24.99]This is a YouTube video stream?
[227:26.60]I mean, like, all of them could be.
[227:32.32]This is a coping mechanism for me not to get mad, don't you understand?
[227:39.08]Contrary to what you guys might believe, I am desperately trying not to eat a chunk of my monitor.
[227:49.83]Oh my goodness, that was a bad move.
[228:03.98]I want this item.
[228:04.48]What the hell is going on over here?
[228:20.68]Ah, it's called the big fish eat the little fish.
[228:30.19]I come in and just like...
[228:34.33]Can you imagine if there was something like that in, like, in humanity?
[228:37.83]Like, you know the whale sharks that just, like, float forward, just hold their mouths open, and they eat, like, a hundred fucking million fish?
[228:44.51]Can you imagine if you were just walking around outside, and there was just this thing that was just moving slowly forward with its mouth open?
[228:53.05]You'd be like, we're just dead.
[228:56.26]Like, this thing's just gonna eat us.
[228:57.56]Like, we're just gonna die.
[228:58.54]Like, what do we do?
[229:01.24]We're so lucky that spiders are as big as they are.
[229:03.31]Imagine spiders were as big as a house.
[229:07.17]Well, okay.
[229:09.81]What do you do about that?
[229:19.76]Who are you?
[229:24.02]There's a face I've not seen before.
[229:26.75]Edgar.
[229:26.91]It's getting quieter.
[229:50.87]Something wrong with my headphones?
[229:52.25]Why is he quiet?
[229:53.73]He's so quiet.
[229:54.45]Give the letter.
[229:55.79]Oh, my audio has been fucked up the whole time.
[230:19.04]Even if the castle should fall, as commander, I must remain to ensure the treasured sword of Morn does not fall into the hands.
[230:28.34]Okay.
[230:31.73]If you see Irina, do tell her that her father will come for her once he's fulfilled his duty.
[230:39.77]If you see Irina, her father will... What did you give me?
[230:44.05]A blade?
[230:46.43]Where's the money?
[230:47.64]I don't want a twig, I want money.
[230:59.48]Where is it?
[231:03.66]Oh, I can upgrade my blast.
[231:09.61]Where is it?
[231:10.01]I don't know.
[231:10.93]Like a little twig?
[231:18.63]It's an item?
[231:25.19]It's a talisman.
[231:27.41]Oh, we'll be lost on... Okay.
[231:29.91]So if you die with this on, you don't lose your runes.
[231:32.21]Okay.
[231:34.91]Well, I found you.
[231:36.93]Unfortunately, you won't leave.
[231:39.65]So, okay.
[231:40.35]Okay.
[231:51.00]Back into the castle.
[231:57.49]It did not go this way.
[232:07.42]Anything else over here?
[232:08.42]Ah!
[232:13.42]Just need to take a moment.
[232:14.64]Okay.
[232:14.94]You should take a cartoon bite out of your keyboard.
[232:24.66]What does this do for me?
[232:26.14]I'm in a bad spot.
[232:27.24]Alright, whatever.
[232:31.54]I'm not going to rest at that because I don't... Wait, what?
[232:39.79]I don't think I'm going to rest at that one.
[232:43.95]Maybe I should have.
[232:49.97]Here comes a ball joke.
[232:52.42]You didn't- I didn't even realize I could do that.
[233:02.90]Why isn't he doing it?
[233:03.64]Do what?
[233:07.40]So wait, you want me to lift up my keyboard and take like a big bite and have there be the ice cream bar packaging bite?
[233:14.68]Which is like the corner of the top of the ice cream?
[233:18.10]I can't do that right now.
[233:19.04]I'm sorry.
[233:28.39]I already ate a shoe.
[233:30.87]I'm going up there.
[233:49.47]Eating keyboards.
[233:52.72]What's that down there?
[233:56.22]Oi!
[233:56.82]What's that down there?
[234:08.18]Alright, be careful.
[234:09.68]I don't wanna... Something's gonna happen here.
[234:11.82]Guess not.
[234:24.80]Okay, so what's here?
[234:26.92]Old fang.
[234:27.72]What else?
[234:31.52]My wife and baby would love to watch you eat your keyboard.
[234:34.67]Your baby doesn't understand anything besides that there's colors on screen.
[234:47.33]Twin blade talisman.
[234:56.32]Final hit of chain attacks?
[234:59.91]A lot of cool stuff, but not for me.
[235:01.49]Okay.
[235:06.87]That's that.
[235:10.41]Baby sensory.
[235:11.79]Yeah, your baby doesn't understand what I'm saying.
[235:16.22]All your baby hears is just like... Hmm.
[235:21.18]Hmm.
[235:23.50]Hmm.
[235:24.44]Hmm.
[235:25.42]Hmm.
[235:26.96]Hmm.
[235:27.96]Hmm.
[235:29.19]That's literally all your baby understands.
[235:32.51]Finally, after like a year or two, your baby can like, my ears are developed for me to hear things.
[235:50.42]Look at their eyes.
[235:51.22]Don't you understand that like a baby's eyes, it's like they can't see.
[235:57.33]They're like constantly developing their senses.
[236:05.70]Mars attack alien.
[236:19.96]Nothing down there.
[236:20.60]Was this all that was over here?
[236:22.75]No, there has to be more.
[236:27.09]Nothing.
[236:27.31]Alright, let's go.
[236:35.19]Should go down?
[236:36.55]I can't go down.
[236:37.23]Oh, that's right.
[236:40.73]Oh, nice.
[236:42.03]Alright, I'm stopping.
[236:44.49]That's enough.
[236:51.42]What's going on?
[236:52.76]What's going on over there is what I want to know.
[237:06.23]Who's over there?
[237:07.03]Oh, Father Gravestone, of course.
[237:14.63]I must fulfill my duty.
[237:17.85]I must fulfill my duty.
[237:19.75]I almost just died.
[237:21.45]I jumped for no reason, and it was the only thing that kept me alive.
[237:25.03]I actually just died right there.
[237:37.23]I must take my leave.
[237:41.67]What is the saying?
[237:42.43]Fear the blood.
[237:45.23]Eat the blood.
[237:46.87]Drink the old blood.
[237:49.73]Willem, I must go.
[237:50.87]You know what's cool about the Souls games?
[237:58.38]These actors, I feel like...
[238:01.31]They're... They're just so good.
[238:02.99]I wish I knew who they were.
[238:05.41]I feel like I don't know any of the other things that these actors have been in.
[238:08.71]I missed an item?
[238:19.24]What item?
[238:22.12]Did?
[238:22.40]I was talking.
[238:25.46]Whip?
[238:25.76]That's awesome, but I don't want it.
[238:27.30]Did I miss an item?
[238:28.00]I actually did.
[238:28.68]Okay, no more talking.
[238:31.72]Did I really miss an item?
[238:32.42]Whatever.
[238:32.68]It was a fucking smithereen, Simone.
[238:34.44]Whatever it is.
[238:35.28]I don't care.
[238:35.76]It was a Smithing Stone.
[238:45.69]Dude, Tom Brady voices the main character.
[238:54.07]Oh, yes.
[238:54.65]Eldon won.
[238:55.52]You never know when they get really close.
[238:56.82]What if that was a celebrity that doesn't really do voice acting or act, really?
[239:00.85]They're always super close to the microphone and they're just talking loudly.
[239:03.79]It's like loud talking is not acting, but that's what they do.
[239:10.87]Oh my goodness, I can't believe what we're looking at here.
[239:14.51]No, you're not going to get that by me.
[239:17.05]Loud talking always equals acting.
[239:18.79]Okay, I got 8,200.
[239:31.45]Are you guys ready for me to one-shot kill this b-b-b-b-b-b-b-boss?
[239:44.85]Oh!
[239:45.25]Whoa!
[239:45.79]Oh!
[239:46.25]What?
[239:46.67]Whoa!
[239:46.77]Oh my god!
[239:47.67]Whoa!
[239:48.19]That's- I gotta make sure I have at least one of those every few, uh, like, every 30 minutes or so, so the editors can make sure they get some, like, funny, like, a clip.
[239:54.09]Like, a funny clip from that.
[239:56.47]I gotta do, like, every, like, 30 minutes, but I haven't done it in a while.
[240:04.88]Anything else over this way?
[240:11.54]I'm just checking.
[240:13.25]Shut up.
[240:15.51]What are you doing over there?
[240:16.61]Shut up.
[240:27.49]Whoa, that's the edge of the world.
[240:31.97]Oh, I got a
[240:32.96]Somber Smithing Stone.
[240:42.85]Can't go on the horse.
[240:43.71]There's something over there.
[240:44.33]Oh look, a crab.
[240:55.47]A huge crab.
[240:56.93]In every fucking zone.
[241:02.41]That's not even surprising anymore.
[241:09.29]That's not even surprising to me anymore.
[241:21.94]I so badly want to do it.
[241:24.36]Should I do it?
[241:27.18]I don't think I want to do it on camera, so I'll hide.
[241:29.60]No, I'm not going to do it.
[241:30.42]Fuck it.
[241:37.79]What the fuck are you talking about?
[241:44.56]What?
[241:44.78]No, never mind.
[241:57.78]Is this gonna kill me?
[241:59.76]Be serious.
[242:00.56]Will this kill me if I go down?
[242:01.72]No, I think it might.
[242:02.56]I'm gonna go from the bridge.
[242:06.20]tree oh those those actors are so goddamn funny that was so fun I don't I think I want to level up first yeah let's just kill these guys until we level up how many do these guys give it's not very much
[242:40.44]It's not a lot.
[242:51.77]Who has some decent amount of souls?
[242:53.33]It's too much to go die at a boss with.
[243:09.09]I'll probably die once or twice.
[243:17.20]I just need to get some souls here.
[243:19.26]Is there an item up there?
[243:22.66]Nah.
[243:27.28]Nah, dude.
[243:28.02]Alright.
[243:34.32]You're going to kill the guy.
[243:35.18]This is literally the easiest boss in the game.
[243:38.72]Yeah, but I... Okay, don't say that, because then if I lose, then I look bad.
[243:47.55]I'm not that far.
[243:48.15]I'm going to kill the big giant guy.
[243:51.59]Okay.
[244:15.54]Are you gonna get pinwheeled?
[244:17.20]I don't know, man.
[244:18.02]Okay, there's 11,000.
[244:22.85]I got one of these runes.
[244:36.50]Alright.
[244:36.94]Getting there.
[244:37.42]Almost there.
[244:37.88]Almost there.
[244:38.76]Almost there.
[244:41.20]Almost there.
[244:41.58]Alright.
[244:43.44]I'll go kill him.
[244:44.00]Fine.
[244:44.60]Jerma, please.
[244:45.06]The boss is like pinwheel.
[244:46.13]Fine.
[244:46.49]Okay.
[244:46.95]It's pinwheel.
[244:48.17]The boss is pinwheel.
[244:52.29]Fine.
[244:54.05]I'll go all this for a single level.
[244:55.55]I'll go get him right now.
[244:56.93]He's pinwheel.
[244:57.85]Well, let's show him.
[244:58.45]Let's show him who's boss.
[245:01.03]It's literally pinwheel.
[245:02.31]Alright.
[245:02.83]Alright.
[245:03.21]Alright.
[245:03.51]Alright.
[245:03.77]Relax.
[245:04.29]I'll go get him.
[245:08.78]This boss is the easiest boss in the game.
[245:10.70]Okay, fine.
[245:22.85]Leonine, misbegotten?
[245:44.78]I wouldn't call this guy Pinwheel.
[246:11.54]This guy ain't fucking pinwheel.
[246:27.55]so so
[246:46.56]Thank you for watching
[247:20.97]This guy ain't fucking pinwheeled!
[247:22.51]This guy's got moves!
[247:33.17]Good thing I have, like, yeah, I'll get him.
[247:36.25]It's not that bad.
[247:36.71]Like, I also, I, like, where, where are those fucking sacred tears?
[247:48.38]I thought they were down here!
[247:50.70]Alright, relax.
[247:51.40]How have I only found one the whole time I've played this game?
[247:57.12]It's impossible!
[248:11.66]Alright now I'm like trying to art I
[248:47.72]bump heads just like bumped into each other that's weird
[249:14.73]That was close.
[249:46.43]Crafted Blade Greatsword.
[249:48.79]Wow.
[249:56.00]What the heck is that?
[250:09.44]Oh my goodness gracious This looks like the shit that you pick out of your leg if you've been when you go into the woods Things that like are just attached to your body What is the move
[250:39.53]Is it a block?
[250:41.74]That's a pretty cool weapon.
[250:48.14]Yeah, that guy wasn't that bad.
[250:49.08]But, I mean, I'm obviously probably five plus levels leveled for it.
[250:56.48]Look for churches.
[250:57.34]I mean... A church?
[251:03.52]I need to find a church.
[251:07.34]I mean... Bro.
[251:18.66]Can I just get another one of those?
[251:19.66]Alright.
[251:21.18]Well, that's cool.
[251:23.20]That's a really cool fight.
[251:26.96]Nothing too fancy schmancy.
[251:28.82]Just got to kill him.
[251:36.52]Okay.
[251:37.38]So let's go from here.
[251:38.22]Alright.
[251:41.14]Is this a church right here?
[251:42.52]That looks kind of church-ish.
[251:45.61]That looks kind of like the top of a church.
[251:48.99]Either that or here.
[251:49.91]That's not a church.
[251:56.06]Where's a church?
[251:56.92]I'm looking for a church.
[251:58.10]Is this a church?
[252:01.54]They're marked on the map.
[252:06.32]That looks like a church.
[252:11.68]This looks like a... There's no church here.
[252:14.62]They look like ruins.
[252:17.85]This looks like it.
[252:18.61]I'm going to go to two.
[252:28.18]Why does everything look like a church to you?
[252:33.53]Everything doesn't look like a church.
[252:34.73]I mean, like, they're all buildings.
[252:45.83]That looks like a church.
[252:47.33]We're going to check it out.
[252:54.46]Oh, let me go talk to... What's that?
[252:56.90]The girl.
[252:57.20]I got to go talk to the girl that I gave the letter.
[253:00.20]She's like, give this letter to my father.
[253:03.78]He's right here, right?
[253:05.26]Where was she?
[253:05.65]Right here?
[253:06.95]He was right here somewhere.
[253:07.67]Was she at the rampart or was she at the gate?
[253:14.61]Where is she?
[253:17.96]He was back here, right back at the door.
[253:20.37]You need to take a shower?
[253:23.41]Don't tell me when I need to clean, okay?
[253:30.22]I assure you, I am very clean.
[253:56.99]Or do I have to really go to the other one?
[254:04.06]Jeremy, you're too stressed out today.
[254:05.90]I'm fine.
[254:06.70]Run and jump?
[254:16.34]I just did that.
[254:22.99]She's right here.
[254:25.87]Where is she?
[254:26.31]Isn't she right here?
[254:33.47]I thought she was sitting right over here somewhere.
[255:02.42]Wait, what?
[255:04.14]She's dead.
[255:05.84]What do you mean she's dead?
[255:10.91]Did somebody drop a sword on her from up there?
[255:13.25]Alright, oops!
[255:18.91]Ding, ding, ding!
[255:19.91]Ding, ding!
[255:21.71]Shoosh!
[255:25.01]Oh, I'm in big trouble.
[255:25.87]I'm gonna be in big fucking trouble.
[255:30.51]Frank, I was never fucking on the rampart.
[255:32.39]Please, you gotta help me.
[255:37.79]Uh... Dad was over here.
[255:49.14]Dad was, like, up in the tower.
[255:54.14]Up there.
[256:02.53]You should level up.
[256:03.11]I will.
[256:10.06]Where was the dad?
[256:15.26]Up on the... I just said my object permanence, especially with the game with this 500 million places to go.
[256:21.35]Is... He was up in one of these.
[256:23.77]That one there?
[256:24.31]I think he was further in.
[256:27.63]Yeah, he was actually inside the castle.
[256:37.98]And... Lift?
[256:41.37]I remember him just sitting on top of one of these things.
[256:45.61]Here?
[256:45.87]By, like, the rampart?
[256:46.89]You guys have got to go through and up to the left tower.
[256:56.11]God.
[256:56.99]Does this go up?
[256:57.57]I don't know.
[257:04.15]Uh... Where the fuck is he?
[257:13.36]I'm not in the castle right now.
[257:18.56]I remember doing this and then he's like up in there.
[257:25.09]I don't know.
[257:25.69]I have no idea where he is.
[257:27.63]You can't remember the dungeon he just cleared?
[257:29.61]No, dude.
[257:30.11]I can't because it's so big.
[257:32.45]There's so much to see.
[257:33.41]There's so much going on.
[257:35.94]It's so hard to remember everything.
[257:39.42]I have absolutely no idea how to get up there.
[257:44.61]Like, if you gave me $100 million right now and said in 10 seconds, show me on the map where he is, I wouldn't be able to do it.
[257:51.96]I physically wouldn't do it.
[257:53.30]I wouldn't be able to.
[258:02.63]What I should have done is I should have marked where he was.
[258:19.48]Because the thing with the Souls games for me, and this probably happens to a lot of you guys too, is you have, like, an ever-moving window of stuff that you know.
[258:28.12]And, like, it just keeps moving like this.
[258:30.91]And all you can remember and all you can do is to shit in this line here.
[258:36.55]And it moves with you.
[258:38.61]So, like, you'll get through an area.
[258:41.25]And, like, you start here.
[258:43.29]Oh, there he is.
[258:43.79]He's on top of the fucking rampart.
[258:45.27]I know where that guy is.
[258:46.73]And then, like, half an hour later, it's like that guy never existed.
[258:50.72]It's like, you can't even go back that far.
[258:52.92]It's moving with you.
[258:56.04]So, like, now, now I remember where he is.
[258:58.30]Now I remember.
[259:00.78]He's up there.
[259:01.20]I just gotta get there.
[259:05.45]That's the fastest way to get there, this way.
[259:16.47]It's like there's an ever-moving window of stuff that I can remember in these games.
[259:23.85]Because remember, in the back of my mind, I'm thinking about all the... Where's my weapon?
[259:28.11]What are you doing?
[259:34.06]There's so much other side info in the back of my head that I need to remember.
[259:39.28]That's just here.
[259:40.70]And they all get mixed up together in a pot.
[259:53.13]That's what the notepad is for?
[259:54.07]Well, that's what the markers are for, but I'm not using them.
[259:56.85]Effectively.
[259:58.60]Okay, so he's like here.
[260:05.38]All the way up there.
[260:23.24]Oh my god, you motherfucker.
[260:24.50]How do I get over there?
[260:29.02]Oh, don't die.
[260:29.84]For the love of god, please.
[260:30.92]Is he gonna die?
[260:45.08]Down here, and then up.
[260:47.91]Alright, alright.
[260:48.95]We're good.
[260:49.25]Alright, am I going the right way?
[260:56.77]There's something else here.
[261:01.74]I found something else.
[261:13.62]Ooh, a Smithing Stone.
[261:16.43]Okay, so he's like up there.
[261:19.41]Is he on this one or is he on the other one?
[261:26.18]No, he's definitely on this one.
[261:29.32]This is right.
[261:30.84]Other way.
[261:36.42]I never got that item.
[261:40.41]The east corner.
[261:43.33]He's like in here.
[261:45.73]Would he be at the fire?
[261:47.29]Is there a ladder that I didn't see?
[261:56.08]EPS needed.
[261:56.70]This is not east.
[261:59.64]This is east.
[262:01.12]What are you talking about?
[262:04.94]Not south.
[262:07.64]I can't go any more east.
[262:10.36]There's no more east I can go.
[262:11.84]Are you here?
[262:13.21]He's dead.
[262:18.33]Dickhead's over there.
[262:19.63]Alright.
[262:20.17]Fucking god damn it, man.
[262:23.09]I thought he was up in one of those tower things.
[262:35.19]There's so many roundabouts and ladders you climb and then jump down and then drop down and go around the corner.
[262:41.06]It's kind of hard to navigate.
[262:43.62]I'm in your debt for keeping the sword from those fallen creatures.
[262:47.50]There's not just a ladder sitting in front of them.
[262:49.60]It's like, go up, climb up, and then go around that side and then drop down and then go around the rock around the bridge and then up and into the right.
[262:57.38]Thanks to you, I will devote my remaining days to her.
[263:01.81]Marina has a gentle nature, though.
[263:05.19]I only hope it remains intact.
[263:09.77]Thanks to you, I will devote my remaining days to her.
[263:13.27]I can't just... She's dead.
[263:14.70]What does that do?
[263:23.22]Kill him?
[263:26.08]I don't think I want to kill him.
[263:26.76]He might show up later.
[263:27.32]I'm not going to kill him.
[263:37.74]Now go back to her location.
[263:50.16]You're freaking $100 million.
[264:11.05]Arena?
[264:12.73]Have my daughter deserved better?
[264:16.11]The fault lies with me.
[264:19.04]I chose duty over my daughter's safety.
[264:22.28]And that is how fate has answered.
[264:27.78]I'll find them.
[264:29.68]The foul wretch is responsible for this.
[264:32.52]I'll hunt them down and exterminate every last one of them.
[264:37.10]Rest assured, Arena, it will be done.
[264:44.18]Okay.
[264:45.06]Oh.
[264:51.86]Now what?
[264:58.02]Is that at the end of his little thing there?
[264:59.56]I don't think I'm going to kill him.
[265:02.96]That's it.
[265:03.86]Kill him.
[265:04.72]Kill.
[265:07.68]Why would I kill him?
[265:12.61]He definitely shows up later.
[265:13.69]Why wouldn't he?
[265:14.35]No, I'm not killing him.
[265:18.89]Alright, time to go to the church and get my goddamn, for the first time in history, a flask level up.
[265:26.71]For the first time in history.
[265:34.45]We're going to number three.
[266:00.08]Up here, around the left.
[266:03.25]You should have plus four by the time you go back to... Really?
[266:06.23]What a gun.
[266:24.06]Enter Evergale.
[266:24.90]Is it area?
[266:30.48]Mark it.
[266:33.62]No, no, no, no.
[266:34.97]Go to church.
[266:35.65]I know.
[266:36.23]Hold on.
[266:40.57]I lost my marker.
[266:46.65]What the fuck is happening with these markers?
[266:49.43]Four.
[266:49.61]Four.
[267:05.91]Don't kill me, please.
[267:06.61]Okay.
[267:14.16]Herm, I'm begging you, read the map.
[267:15.40]The map is 2D.
[267:20.04]It's hard to read this.
[267:20.89]Can I even get across there from... I don't think I can make it from here.
[267:29.97]Maybe this way?
[267:46.90]Let's go.
[267:48.28]Okay.
[268:03.86]Still gonna find a way.
[268:05.64]Oh my god.
[268:14.93]This was kind of way out of the fucking way.
[268:27.32]My boys are way cooler.
[268:30.82]Alright.
[268:32.20]Give me one.
[268:34.38]Mausoleum prowls, cradling the soulless demigod.
[268:37.62]Perch of Pilgrimage.
[268:44.53]Let's go.
[268:51.65]Sacred Tear.
[268:52.49]Thank God.
[268:53.67]Thank the Lord.
[268:56.11]Upgrade.
[268:57.51]Upgrade.
[268:58.41]Upgrade.
[268:59.57]Upgrade time.
[269:00.23]Out of charge.
[269:08.44]Sacred tear.
[269:09.34]Let's go.
[269:10.04]Thank you.
[269:10.54]Okay.
[269:19.96]That's that church.
[269:21.58]I see a church right here.
[269:22.88]Is that a church?
[269:25.65]I think that's a church.
[269:26.41]How do I get over there?
[269:43.75]Any more churches?
[269:47.13]In this direct vicinity?
[269:51.66]Could be.
[269:56.21]I'm gonna investigate these.
[269:57.61]These could be.
[270:04.18]Four and five.
[270:15.75]That's definitely a church over there.
[270:16.91]Alright, hell yeah.
[270:18.31]Let's fucking... Come on, man.
[270:19.43]Can we do this?
[270:26.02]How many seeds do I have?
[270:26.84]That was my third.
[270:29.08]So I have zero now.
[270:37.01]This is definitely not a church, but that is.
[270:38.85]So I'll have plus three.
[270:40.03]Come back here later.
[270:43.34]What is that?
[271:00.78]Who the hell was that?
[271:09.15]I don't want to fuck with that thing right now.
[271:10.81]No, not yet.
[271:17.21]These guys have no heads.
[271:25.38]Alright.
[271:26.82]Give me another flask thing.
[271:28.02]This is definitely a church.
[271:34.99]Fourth church of Marika.
[271:41.41]Oh yeah.
[271:53.23]Okay, I'm in a much better position now.
[271:55.41]I played this whole damn game without this.
[271:57.23]How did I fucking do that?
[272:02.22]Alright, very nice.
[272:04.46]I'm gonna say seven and two is fine.
[272:11.83]Uh... Is there any more?
[272:25.57]What about, like, here?
[272:28.13]This looks kind of church-like.
[272:29.33]Investigate that tree.
[272:44.86]On the map?
[272:47.22]You mean this one?
[272:47.78]I think I already was over here.
[272:54.39]I think I wanna, maybe I, let me, wait, I need to level up.
[273:11.18]Either health or more intelligence, yeah, just intelligence.
[273:22.58]Go to the tower that's here.
[273:28.89]The game just crashed.
[273:31.77]What's going on?
[273:33.41]You gonna come back?
[273:33.89]Uh-oh.
[273:40.37]What's the last thing that happened?
[273:45.28]Fuck.
[273:46.52]Hold on.
[273:47.22]If the stream dies, I'll be right back.
[273:48.42]I hope it doesn't.
[273:49.50]Hold on.
[274:00.00]Uh... That was weird.
[274:09.59]Um... I think I'm okay.
[274:10.93]I think I'm okay.
[274:22.42]Yeah, we're good.
[274:23.10]That was weird.
[274:24.18]I spammed the markers so they'd crash my game.
[274:26.70]Kind of annoying.
[274:33.72]Hopefully I didn't lose any progress or anything.
[274:35.26]There's an Elden Ring save conflict.
[274:43.09]Definitely the one from like two minutes ago.
[274:51.59]My computer's locking up now.
[274:53.09]What the fuck is going on?
[274:55.19]What the fuck is happening, dude?
[274:58.55]I pressed put a marker down five times and then my whole computer's locking up.
[275:07.26]Fuck off.
[275:19.01]Windows update?
[275:19.73]No, no.
[275:20.15]Is this the game?
[275:20.65]Just died.
[275:21.27]Okay, well.
[275:25.47]Hope I didn't lose any progress.
[275:26.45]Let's come back.
[275:34.54]I don't think I lost any progress.
[275:37.44]Last save was the local file was from a minute ago, so... Let's hope not.
[275:49.31]Yeah, alright.
[275:59.78]We're fine.
[276:02.26]That was very odd.
[276:14.71]Yeah, I think we're good.
[276:16.67]So, I needed to go down here.
[276:21.15]Okay, I'm gonna do that slower now.
[276:27.04]I think I clicked it too fast.
[276:28.02]So, I wanna go here.
[276:30.30]And here.
[276:32.06]And maybe here.
[276:33.22]Let's go.
[276:43.26]Ooh, it's a little house.
[276:52.95]Love, love Wart.
[276:55.97]People just hanging out on the beach.
[277:03.79]Something in the water.
[277:05.22]What's that?
[277:05.74]Oh, it's just a tree.
[277:08.56]Never mind.
[277:15.72]Game's sick.
[277:23.95]Alright, who's this person?
[277:36.97]They all have such interesting stuff.
[277:38.23]Well, there's a lantern, but I don't need it.
[277:39.79]Another key.
[277:41.93]Alright.
[277:42.31]Well, you're cool.
[277:43.81]Enjoy your shack.
[277:53.49]Okay, so is this a church up here?
[277:55.35]Get the lantern?
[278:00.18]Uh, I have the spell.
[278:03.88]I don't really need it.
[278:08.23]Oh, three crunchies.
[278:15.55]Three crunchies.
[278:17.17]Crunchy spot.
[278:27.56]That's what that is.
[278:28.16]So then what's this?
[278:28.92]I'm really sorry, but I was afraid that you're going to get me.
[278:42.38]Alright, well, it's not over here.
[278:57.59]I gotta go back up to, like, land.
[279:09.00]Come on.
[279:09.38]I can't, like, catch it.
[279:10.10]There we go.
[279:17.74]That thing is so weird.
[279:18.55]I gotta go see what that thing actually does.
[279:38.51]Stop ringing the bell, it's annoying me!
[279:52.22]Alright, what's up here?
[280:05.90]Got great dragonfly head Okay, what do you got this doesn't look like a church but there's something here hour of return
[280:30.22]I think I'll play the Kingsfield games.
[280:38.91]No, not a chance.
[280:40.81]Not a chance.
[280:42.59]I've seen gameplay of Kingsfield, and it just looks... I don't think I can do it.
[280:55.25]It seems like a... what's that first-person RPG game?
[281:02.59]It's a first-person RPG that's really, really just strange.
[281:08.34]Nope.
[281:09.48]Actually, let's do it.
[281:14.16]Wait.
[281:17.11]Wait, nothing in there?
[281:31.01]I'm just going to go.
[281:31.95]I'm curious where it takes me.
[281:43.09]Lyndell Royal Capital.
[281:48.01]Oh dear, OK, well.
[281:54.24]Uh.
[281:57.00]OK, where am I?
[282:08.26]Is somebody lying down?
[282:09.34]Oh yeah, you're gonna get up, obviously.
[282:27.65]There's a chest over there.
[282:29.21]Thought I was gonna stagger him.
[282:41.99]Jesus!
[283:14.22]Fucking stop trying to squash me!
[283:15.76]Oh my god!
[283:16.68]Is this an early end game area?
[283:25.53]Oh, fuck.
[283:26.19]I can beat this guy.
[283:31.01]Let me kill this guy.
[283:31.65]He probably drops like 20,000 souls.
[283:52.54]Oh, he's gonna fall off?
[283:55.22]I can't... I don't... He's gonna... Is he gonna fall?
[284:00.59]Who falls first here?
[284:01.63]I don't know.
[284:02.21]Can he fall?
[284:10.21]I don't think he can fall off.
[284:12.31]As much as I want him to.
[284:16.82]Come on, trip him.
[284:49.94]Alright.
[285:00.00]Still not enough?
[285:17.36]Whoa!
[285:22.86]I didn't get it.
[285:23.34]I thought I staggered him.
[285:29.54]Did I get it?
[285:32.10]Nope.
[285:32.34]I thought he was falling down.
[285:33.46]I'm good.
[285:35.43]Every time he goes like, ah, down to one knee, I think I'm staggering him.
[285:42.35]Your face is red.
[285:54.95]I'm gonna try this one more time.
[285:55.87]I'm not supposed to be here, so I'm gonna leave.
[285:57.89]But I feel like I can do it.
[286:16.68]You know what?
[286:17.18]Fuck you, buddy.
[286:22.20]Yeah.
[286:22.76]Fuck off.
[286:23.96]I'm taking your fucking free shit.
[286:26.36]Thank you.
[286:26.70]Thanks for the talisman.
[286:29.38]I'm not supposed to be here.
[286:37.28]It don't matter.
[286:59.77]Alright, I'm out.
[287:03.03]I got the item.
[287:07.15]I got the item.
[287:08.11]I'm not supposed to be here.
[287:08.83]There's a dead end mini boss?
[287:17.98]There's a portal on the other side.
[287:21.76]Does he actually drop anything?
[287:26.14]I mean, I know this isn't a boss.
[287:29.92]These enemies that are like as big as the whole screen, it's just so hard to tell when they're going to swing their weapon.
[288:02.60]I'll get him!
[288:04.82]I just gotta stop being greedy.
[288:06.04]Hit him twice and run away.
[288:07.02]Otherwise, you physically cannot see what he's doing.
[288:18.07]They fall over?
[288:18.89]Yeah, but I need to do more damage.
[288:23.03]You got this, tomato boy.
[288:25.23]Shut up.
[289:07.52]That wasn't enough fire.
[289:10.44]Hey!
[289:42.67]I knew that was going to happen.
[289:51.07]He was just too close to the edge.
[289:53.09]I thought he was going to do the thing where he pulls up.
[290:02.32]I tried jump attacking.
[290:03.88]I feel like I won't hit him in the ankle though.
[290:19.12]What?
[290:21.80]That actually worked?
[290:22.99]I did that two times.
[290:43.50]That staggers that much?
[290:45.58]Oh my goodness, are you kidding me, dude?
[290:47.80]I didn't know it staggered that much.
[291:16.29]That just made that not even a problem.
[291:18.63]Holy shit.
[291:22.07]Oh my goodness.
[291:22.87]Okay, well.
[291:23.47]I just wondered why I had to do that.
[291:29.54]That's more stagger than a fully charged right trigger?
[291:42.54]Well, there was no point in that, but it was fun.
[291:46.98]Alright, what was the talisman?
[291:50.60]Slowly restores HP by how much?
[291:55.90]I think I want that.
[291:58.44]That's cool.
[292:08.09]Alright, what was I doing?
[292:08.97]I was trying to get more flasks, right?
[292:24.05]Cool.
[292:25.67]Okay.
[292:27.59]I have a few options.
[292:29.65]Option one.
[292:31.93]Go kill this goddamn dragon.
[292:35.61]Option two.
[292:37.54]Go finish whatever's going on and carry a manor because I think I didn't complete it all.
[292:44.54]Uh.
[292:46.70]Option 4.
[292:50.84]Head down here.
[292:51.78]Big tree, please.
[293:00.41]Alright, option 5.
[293:01.27]I'll go to big tree.
[293:18.70]Alright, big tree is at number one.
[293:20.62]Let's go.
[293:27.75]I wonder if I should mess around with this too.
[293:33.23]Get off the fucking horse.
[293:37.14]Oh, there it is.
[293:37.72]The tower.
[293:39.32]Finally can return to our home.
[293:40.58]Bathed in rays of gold.
[293:49.52]I'm getting my revenge.
[293:54.67]No, the person said go to the... Okay, I'm going to go to the tree.
[293:58.47]I'm going to go to the tree.
[293:59.41]I'm going to go to the tree.
[294:00.31]I'm going to go to the tree.
[294:01.49]That person that just said, dude, go to the tree, just almost flipped out.
[294:05.57]I'm going to the tree.
[294:23.92]Do the bell.
[294:24.64]Do the bell.
[294:25.36]I gotta do the tree before... I gotta do the tree first.
[294:28.08]Don't go... I need to do the tree first.
[294:30.03]Trust me.
[294:31.39]I'm a... I'm not a doctor.
[294:32.49]I don't want to say that.
[294:33.09]That's... That's fake.
[294:34.03]I don't want somebody to be like, oh, dude, what happened?
[294:36.69]What do you think about my, like, the... I got this, like, pimple on my back.
[294:39.55]I don't care.
[294:40.03]Alright.
[294:42.60]I'm here.
[294:42.92]So what's here?
[294:46.96]What do we got?
[294:49.38]Miner Erdtree.
[294:59.26]What do we got?
[295:06.52]Singing?
[295:22.38]What's here?
[295:33.88]There's nothing here.
[295:41.53]At least not that I can see.
[295:42.65]Go to the pots.
[295:57.51]Something on the pots?
[296:03.90]It's like a time of day thing?
[296:08.44]Who's that?
[296:08.76]Oh, that's the person singing.
[296:15.26]Erdtree Avatar.
[296:18.88]Okay, let's go.
[296:22.28]Is it a caster?
[296:23.38]Oh.
[296:38.44]It's like a tree trunk.
[296:39.40]This boss is kind of cool.
[296:43.46]Not bad.
[297:09.38]oh my god stop talking stop talking stop talking stop talking
[298:00.65]Line of sight, ha ha, stupid!
[298:12.70]Got it!
[298:27.31]He knows chat will make fun of him if he used magic.
[298:32.27]Okay, so that was... Opaline Bubble Tear and Crimson Burst Crystal Tear.
[298:43.19]That was worse than the boss!
[298:44.17]That was scarier than the boss!
[298:46.33]Fuck you, game!
[298:47.53]Oh my god!
[298:48.47]Okay.
[298:57.16]Enhances charged attacks for... Sadly reduces HP.
[299:05.06]Significantly negates damage in mixed physique.
[299:07.37]What do these do?
[299:09.89]What do these do?
[299:14.91]Flask of Wondrous Physique.
[299:21.67]I need a... I still need the flask.
[299:23.77]I don't have... You can make potions with them.
[299:27.57]Oh, cool.
[299:27.93]Okay.
[299:29.35]That was cool.
[299:30.97]Alright, now I get to go to the tree.
[299:32.15]Go to the tree.
[299:32.71]Cool.
[299:33.05]Okay.
[299:34.00]So now... That was a pretty cool fight.
[299:39.44]It's time for... I gotta get my revenge.
[299:41.36]I have to get my revenge.
[299:42.50]I have to kill this fucking dragon before I lose my mind.
[299:53.02]In fact, get off the horse.
[299:54.44]Alright, don't get one hit killed.
[300:05.37]This is it.
[300:13.35]I'm coming in here with knowledge, with more flasks.
[300:17.29]I'm ready.
[300:18.84]I have three attempts.
[300:20.28]We're not angry.
[300:21.50]We're having a good time together.
[300:23.20]You and me are hanging out here.
[300:34.57]Got a little greedy.
[301:25.59]Thank you.
[302:20.31]I don't know.
[302:54.66]What the fuck, dude?
[302:58.48]I thought I was going to be able to sprint away from it.
[303:00.72]I thought I was going to be able to sprint through.
[303:06.88]God damn, man.
[303:07.84]That fucking insta-kill is kind of horseshit, if I'm honest.
[303:12.69]I was trying to do this, like just sprint away from it.
[303:19.23]Okay, so I can't sprint.
[303:20.65]I can't jump, because jumping, I'll hit his body when he lands, and it instantly kills you.
[303:24.52]Fuck you, game.
[303:29.64]What?
[303:37.07]Because when he comes down, I wonder... Instead of running sideways, run, like, forward?
[303:42.81]I don't know.
[303:56.18]Hey, I'm stuck in his body.
[304:28.75]That's bad.
[304:33.33]That's bad.
[305:08.26]Alright, here we go, here we go.
[305:09.74]Forward, straight, straight, straight, straight, straight.
[305:11.11]God, that's a plane.
[305:47.11]Where'd you go?
[305:47.57]Don't be greedy.
[305:54.39]I'm gonna try not to.
[305:55.21]I'm not gonna be greedy.
[306:04.82]Didn't fucking work that time!
[306:06.24]I was running straight.
[306:09.14]Just got lucky and went right between his legs.
[306:30.88]Bad!
[306:53.25]No, don't do that again
[307:23.54]someone invade him I'm not playing online I'm not getting invaded
[308:29.00]Thank you.
[309:02.02]Get stamina, stamina, stamina!
[309:52.09]I'm such a coward.
[309:53.29]I'm too afraid.
[310:18.55]Don't freak out.
[310:35.04]This bug's all over my fucking body.
[311:42.13]Get out of here!
[311:43.13]Oh my god, that was fucking horrible.
[311:45.25]That wasn't even that bad, it was just his heart.
[311:49.50]What did I drop?
[311:50.58]Another dragon heart?
[311:51.26]A new draconic power is available.
[311:56.38]Let's go.
[311:59.66]Good.
[312:00.62]Let's go.
[312:12.29]You're pursing your lips so much they're turning purple.
[312:20.32]I'll get some blood back into him.
[312:22.76]Looks like I've been drinking wine for like four hours.
[312:24.98]The item?
[312:33.16]Dropped an item?
[312:39.21]You look cold.
[312:40.49]I'm not cold.
[312:41.17]I'm actually burning up.
[312:52.28]That description is nonsense.
[312:57.14]Okay.
[312:57.26]Okay.
[312:58.56]We cleaned up a little bit.
[313:01.04]I'm going to level up.
[313:02.21]And then I think it's time.
[313:03.59]It might be time.
[313:09.61]It was an item at your feet, was there actually?
[313:11.33]I mean, this is where I killed him.
[313:15.71]I don't see him.
[313:17.83]Item, item, item.
[313:18.80]It's not an item.
[313:27.20]Where?
[313:29.04]Dragon item?
[313:29.96]I mean, I picked it up, didn't I?
[313:30.96]I don't see it on the ground.
[313:32.19]On the left.
[313:41.03]I... Is this bait?
[313:43.09]Or are you guys serious?
[313:46.61]I killed him right here.
[313:50.07]That was bait.
[313:55.01]Okay, so now... That tied up that loose end.
[313:59.32]I'm just trying to tie up some loose ends.
[314:02.80]What time is it?
[314:09.02]Jesus, what the fuck just happened?
[314:13.80]Okay, that's fine.
[314:14.88]Okay.
[314:21.88]Go back to where he spawned.
[314:23.00]I already got that item.
[314:25.54]I got that a long time ago.
[314:30.95]I mean... Is somebody here?
[314:36.07]Yeah, I already got this one.
[314:41.17]Okay, so now what I'm going to do...
[314:43.98]is I'm going to relax.
[314:46.00]I'm going to chill.
[314:47.24]I'm going to just chill the heck out.
[314:49.70]I'm going to level up.
[314:53.45]And I'm going to try this guy two more times.
[315:06.04]Just two more times.
[315:06.74]I just want to try him two more times.
[315:07.70]That's it.
[315:08.12]I promise.
[315:08.62]Only two times.
[315:18.48]I'm only going to try him two times.
[315:19.68]Go upgrade Oleg.
[315:33.75]I can't really use him here anyways, but... How many souls do I actually have?
[315:38.87]Okay, I have a lot.
[315:48.14]I spent all yesterday trying to beat him, but we got it done.
[315:50.84]Alright.
[315:51.60]I gotta get him done.
[315:52.32]No more complaining.
[315:55.37]No complaints.
[315:56.31]Just beat him.
[316:01.21]I will go upgrade what I can upgrade.
[316:02.83]And I'm gonna buy... Yeah.
[316:05.48]Yeah.
[316:07.18]Okay.
[316:07.54]Give me a sec.
[316:20.51]Okay.
[316:23.23]So, can I... Did I get anything else to upgrade?
[316:25.75]I kind of want to upgrade this other staff.
[316:32.03]You need like 40 vigor to not get one shot.
[316:34.52]I feel like my health is kind of low.
[316:37.98]Maybe I should start focusing on it.
[316:40.04]I feel like I'm too spread out.
[316:51.39]I'm going to use this eventually.
[316:53.17]So I'm going to level it up.
[316:58.35]Got A intelligence scaling.
[317:04.57]I'm going to use this staff eventually.
[317:07.03]In fact, let me see what it is now.
[317:08.21]I don't think I can use it.
[317:13.56]Get the physique flask.
[317:16.22]Maybe I won't.
[317:25.23]Go check out that new dragon power.
[317:27.07]Hmm.
[317:31.56]Maybe.
[317:31.86]Let me do my dumb shit first.
[317:42.85]Okay, I'm gonna buy this.
[317:47.07]I'm gonna buy that because I'm gonna use it.
[317:49.75]And I can justify using it because I just bought it.
[317:56.84]Get the special flask.
[317:59.04]Somebody said it sucks.
[318:01.84]So I just purchased that.
[318:03.28]So I'm going to turn it on.
[318:08.84]Where is it?
[318:11.08]So I have this one on.
[318:13.68]So let me activate it.
[318:14.58]I got 30 intelligence, 25 dex, 20-20.
[318:17.75]Let's see what happens.
[318:21.23]How do I use it?
[318:23.41]Here we go.
[318:37.64]35 intelligence?
[318:39.28]It's 5, plus 5 to everything?
[318:44.56]Okay.
[318:45.76]Alright, alright, alright.
[318:47.92]Um.
[318:49.24]Fuck.
[318:50.18]I die though is a huge problem.
[318:56.69]That's a huge problem if I die.
[318:58.45]Should I even fight the boss?
[319:03.39]I feel like I should not do that now.
[319:05.03]And just do something else.
[319:06.68]Alright.
[319:07.08]Here's what I'm going to do.
[319:17.32]I'm going to go... This way.
[319:22.18]Like here.
[319:25.60]Either that.
[319:27.02]Or... Why is it still pointing down here?
[319:29.99]This tree?
[319:30.65]Go to the other tree?
[319:34.34]Alright, what do you think?
[319:37.22]Up?
[319:40.10]South, west, or north?
[319:47.04]Flask.
[319:47.44]I don't want the flask.
[319:52.62]Up.
[319:53.60]Tree.
[319:57.77]Please get the flask.
[319:59.27]Drew, please.
[320:00.23]Alright, just so chat stops yelling at me.
[320:02.75]Where's this flask at?
[320:09.73]Is everyone going to stop screaming at me?
[320:14.41]It's where?
[320:16.49]Port Haight, which was here.
[320:19.82]What, here?
[320:24.70]I'm not screaming.
[320:27.70]It's on the ship.
[320:29.88]This ship right here?
[320:31.58]North of the Mistwood.
[320:34.42]Like up here.
[320:36.53]Here?
[320:36.73]Oh, yeah.
[320:39.43]Above the Mistwood Erdtree, like somewhere like around here.
[320:46.57]I guess.
[320:49.43]Say that.
[320:51.56]Alright, let's go there.
[321:05.55]That one is number five.
[321:13.49]really need it, you'll be really glad that you got it.
[321:15.11]I'll give it a go.
[321:29.03]So this flask, if I drink out of this, does it... Does it consume that little bubble?
[321:37.81]Is it just a one and done, or is it something I can just put on whenever I feel like it?
[321:49.75]Wait, this is also a church.
[321:51.70]I wonder if this is a sacred tier here as well.
[322:02.88]Flask of wondrous physique.
[322:04.20]You can find crystal tiers at the bases of minor erd trees and elsewhere through the Lands Between.
[322:11.02]In Sights of Grace, you can mix two crystal tears in the flask of wondrous physique.
[322:14.58]This will allow you to create elixirs with various custom effects.
[322:19.46]Okay.
[322:23.06]I mean, he did all this without that.
[322:26.97]Yeah, dude.
[322:27.29]I don't know.
[322:27.61]I didn't... This area... This game is fucking huge.
[322:30.75]I didn't go to the one church that had that.
[322:34.79]I don't know.
[322:35.23]I've just been fucking running around.
[322:37.11]Don't get angry.
[322:49.04]Okay, so now what?
[322:51.82]Mix Wondrous Physique?
[322:58.69]Restores half of total HP.
[323:03.59]Properly boosts stamina.
[323:06.59]Significantly negates damage.
[323:09.31]Damage and... And... Stamina?
[323:16.65]Or damage and... Um...
[323:19.77]Damage and healing.
[323:22.85]It's a one-time use.
[323:26.61]Bubble is basically a free hit.
[323:33.31]I would probably say... I don't know.
[323:36.91]Stamina is pretty big too, though.
[323:40.53]Healing over time is good, but stamina is also...
[323:46.35]I'm doing that.
[323:47.11]I'm doing I can take a hit and I have stamina.
[323:50.29]Alright, go ahead and make it.
[323:52.81]Did it work?
[323:54.35]Okay, so now... You can use it one time per death.
[324:01.69]What?
[324:04.66]What?
[324:06.04]What?
[324:11.70]What?
[324:21.02]That's insane.
[324:22.26]So I can take a free hit and my stamina regenerates.
[324:26.70]It acts like a normal flask.
[324:30.04]No wonder everybody was screaming at me.
[324:36.34]Okay.
[324:36.56]Well, I got what I wanted.
[324:37.52]It's time to now decide... Do I want to try this guy again and get frustrated?
[324:46.12]Or do I... No, I'll get killed and lose the buff.
[325:12.01]I'll go up from here.
[325:14.14]I'll check out this place.
[325:16.62]Let's go.
[325:35.89]I'm going to just ride in this direction.
[325:37.61]There's a big thing over there.
[325:39.07]Let's go that way.
[325:50.17]There's that area there.
[325:52.09]So what's up with that?
[325:53.51]That's the I know that.
[325:54.95]OK, but what about here?
[325:57.97]I want to go like this way.
[325:59.42]Let me mark some stuff.
[326:09.56]Can I cross this?
[326:17.82]There's a bunch of these things down here.
[326:38.47]I wonder, should I kill this thing?
[326:43.29]I feel like that might be a bad thing.
[326:48.78]We're going that way.
[326:52.76]Is it safe to get anywhere from here?
[326:57.18]I think so.
[327:00.74]Can I make that jump?
[327:17.37]That's beautiful, yeah.
[327:18.23]It's a beautiful view.
[327:18.87]Alright, what about over here?
[327:31.51]Very clearly...
[327:45.54]Is that death?
[327:47.48]Probably.
[327:49.68]Probably.
[327:50.04]Yep.
[328:00.45]Okay, so how do I get down there reliably?
[328:02.09]There has to be a way to get down there.
[328:06.83]My buff!
[328:33.79]That sucks.
[328:35.45]Good thing at least I bought it.
[328:38.36]That's why I can never use that fucking thing.
[328:39.94]I never used humanities either because I would use them and just die in five seconds.
[328:43.08]Because I would just forget I turned it on.
[328:45.50]Or it would just be like I would fall off a building or something.
[328:47.70]Like, that's why I don't ever use them.
[328:49.25]I would use them for bosses.
[328:50.37]Like, if I was about to fight a boss, I would use humanities.
[328:57.01]But I... Oh, I turned on the humanity and then I would just like... I would like answer the phone.
[329:01.31]Or I would like put a fucking Cheeto in my mouth and forget everything and then just walk off the building.
[329:06.89]So I can't go that way.
[329:07.61]So how can I go?
[329:13.54]Out here?
[329:16.28]I'm... Imagine I'm gonna... Okay, I'm gonna go from here and I'm gonna go that way.
[329:20.02]See what happens.
[329:20.48]See what this does.
[329:25.76]What about the seal?
[329:27.78]Wait.
[329:29.26]Wasn't that just to go back to the... Wasn't that just to go back to the academy?
[329:35.71]Isn't the seal to go back to the academy?
[329:39.05]I already did the academy.
[329:43.07]Was it?
[329:43.63]Where was it?
[329:44.01]There were two seals.
[329:50.66]Oh, that's right.
[329:51.36]I walked up to one and it was like, sorry.
[329:52.96]Sorry.
[329:56.07]Wait.
[329:57.97]Telling me that I could literally just... I'm going to appear at the other end of the bridge, aren't I?
[330:22.82]Read my palm.
[330:25.98]What a pity it is to... All you can do is stand at a loss without even the half-presence that wished to be whole before the unmoving, unfeeling grand lift ahead.
[330:54.15]Okay.
[330:55.05]This lady could be replaced with a wooden sign.
[331:08.47]Okay, so this is a whole new area.
[331:09.87]Let's see how this plays out.
[331:31.41]Alright, there's these knights here.
[331:37.44]Shit.
[331:41.08]Oh, he's beefy.
[332:06.57]Stop using the fucking tree!
[332:21.48]That hurts.
[332:42.09]This dude is definitely a milk drinker.
[332:43.43]It would be me?
[332:44.39]What do you mean milk drinker?
[332:50.44]I don't drink milk, man.
[332:53.86]Okay.
[332:56.88]This is bad.
[332:57.81]Yeah, very bad.
[333:01.29]Oh, this is really bad.
[333:03.25]Okay.
[333:05.70]I was just triangulating.
[333:07.50]I was literally triangulating.
[333:10.18]One, two, three.
[333:11.12]I couldn't fucking go anywhere.
[333:12.30]They like did.
[333:16.94]I was like a fucking dirt hole trying to dig into a rock in Animal Crossing.
[333:25.63]Where even am I?
[333:26.31]Oh, fuck you.
[333:29.95]Really?
[333:40.63]Alright, yeah, we're bringing out Oleg.
[333:41.97]Can I not summon anybody here?
[333:51.37]Also, I have a question.
[333:53.89]What is the criteria for summoning people?
[333:56.19]I feel like it's just like fucking random.
[333:59.18]When can you summon?
[334:01.04]How come I can't summon people?
[334:03.86]I feel like it's like, oh, it's grayed out.
[334:05.38]Why?
[334:05.84]Has anybody figured that out yet?
[334:13.38]It says there's a boss or a statue nearby.
[334:15.51]Really?
[334:15.77]What?
[335:04.09]Goddamn horses.
[335:08.69]Yeah, I'm talking about these.
[335:09.51]I feel like there's just like kind of random times when you can't summon them.
[335:14.39]I kind of figured out what that means.
[335:21.62]Okay, let's do this.
[335:22.62]This is what I wanted to do before I got rudely interrupted.
[335:51.81]Fuck off already.
[335:55.99]You old man, just sit on the ledge.
[336:11.82]I gotta get down.
[336:12.46]It's too hard to fight on the horseback here.
[336:15.22]I gotta rather just fight him.
[336:52.96]Oh, I didn't have any stamina.
[336:54.02]He broke it.
[336:55.10]I tried to jump.
[337:06.52]What the fuck?
[337:08.06]My hands are so wet.
[337:15.45]Like, literally, it's like I dumped my hand in a fucking sink.
[337:23.03]Like, literally, my hands are covered in fucking water.
[337:25.26]Okay.
[337:29.90]Jesus Christ.
[337:35.70]There's a little stone spire nearby where you can summon.
[337:38.27]There's a boss area, right?
[337:42.01]Remember that thing?
[337:51.43]This is actually one of the only games where I would wear those, like, fingerless gamer gloves.
[337:55.84]You know what I mean?
[337:56.76]The, like, biker... I want biker gloves.
[337:59.74]I'm gonna get them for next time.
[338:07.54]Like, it would be embarrassing for me to shake somebody's hand right now.
[338:11.32]I would have to... If it was... No, no, no.
[338:12.84]Shake my hand right now, Jerma.
[338:14.62]It'd be like...
[338:21.66]I wouldn't do it.
[338:22.90]Racing gloves, yeah.
[338:29.08]Okay.
[338:29.30]What else is here?
[338:42.34]Is there anything on the... This is not one of those map things I can get here, right?
[338:45.72]Let's keep going.
[339:07.47]Yep, yep We find the the moon katana yet I have not
[339:36.49]Alright, we're going to keep going this way.
[339:38.27]I guess.
[339:51.16]Dear.
[339:55.60]We got.
[340:05.31]Charm a pierced enemy, or... You don't got very... You got a cool bow.
[340:11.91]Focus.
[340:16.41]Immunity.
[340:16.95]Now.
[340:19.50]I'll mark it.
[340:21.70]Because I should probably mark all these guys anyways.
[340:25.14]Like, that's the merchant house, right?
[340:29.38]That's what I've been saying.
[340:50.85]Yeah, marking the merchant's a good idea.
[341:04.06]Yeah.
[341:10.36]okay I'm gonna parry this fucking guy and I'm gonna stop being an embarrassing video game player that begins now that's it's not parry on this
[341:43.56]What else is down here?
[341:55.30]I gotta find a map fragment or something.
[341:56.94]What, are you gonna cast a spell?
[342:13.98]I feel like a lot of people are resistant to magic in this game.
[342:16.40]I feel like I'm running into all the places where they are.
[342:20.49]But... I've been... I've happened.
[342:22.39]I mean, my weapon is intelligence.
[342:24.75]That's, like, the whole point, right?
[342:25.85]A little hut.
[342:40.25]Alright, give me a map.
[342:41.85]A map fragment of some kind.
[342:49.27]Interesting.
[342:50.20]Where are we?
[342:52.04]You ever tried cheese?
[342:56.94]Something, formula cheese, whatever that is.
[343:02.02]Where is this?
[343:04.01]Ravine Veiled Village.
[343:09.89]I'm going to go.
[343:10.23]Let's go up.
[343:16.45]Map fragments are already on you.
[343:17.64]Yeah, usually they show up here.
[343:18.88]Like, I'm looking for one of them now.
[343:22.24]Like, that's one right there.
[343:23.28]I'm trying to see this one here.
[343:26.34]In this vicinity.
[343:29.08]Well, shit.
[343:29.98]Let's just go up.
[343:40.81]Nothing?
[343:41.21]Okay.
[343:44.43]Or... Or... Ramundo?
[343:48.83]I don't know what that is.
[343:56.20]You look like you can't ride a bike.
[343:59.18]I mean, I would get on and I would go like... Then I would straighten out and be fine.
[344:15.57]Keep going?
[344:15.95]I have the new Oreo shamrock in flurry.
[344:25.01]Is it good?
[344:25.35]I feel like that's too much.
[344:28.76]That sounds like a lot.
[344:40.39]Oreo Shamrock?
[344:43.25]The Shamrock Flurry is kind of... I don't know if I'm into it yet.
[344:50.41]It's kind of... The first, like, two or three sips is like, oh, this is kind of good, and then it just, like... It starts to kind of feel like sludge.
[344:59.08]It gets, like, that, like, sludge feeling, like, in the back of your mouth.
[345:04.68]It has way too much sugar, I think.
[345:06.53]That's probably what it is.
[345:21.56]What should I do?
[345:21.96]Alright.
[345:22.72]I'll take the free kill.
[345:23.52]Why not?
[345:31.41]Poison?
[345:32.31]Oh, fuck you.
[345:33.09]It is poison.
[345:33.93]Alright.
[345:34.29]Oh, this is a disaster.
[345:37.53]Okay.
[345:38.93]I think I have one of those things I need.
[345:45.37]It's rot, right?
[345:50.26]It's not rot?
[345:51.58]What is it?
[345:52.50]Wait, what?
[345:57.76]Poison.
[345:58.14]Do I not have anything that stops poison?
[345:59.83]I thought rot was poison.
[346:02.71]What the fuck is rot then?
[346:07.27]Rot is different than poison.
[346:08.68]I don't think I have anything.
[346:09.74]Can I craft something?
[346:17.49]Blood loss?
[346:18.31]Cures rot buildup.
[346:20.31]It's not rot.
[346:22.33]I can't make any poison blocker thingy.
[346:25.54]Oh well.
[346:27.16]You can out-heal it.
[346:28.38]Rot is poison, but it's... Oh, okay.
[346:29.96]So rot is like the... I feel you.
[346:33.00]I'll just out-heal it.
[346:38.93]Yes, ma'am.
[346:46.98]What's that?
[346:47.40]Sleep?
[346:47.70]These guys just throw like bottles of dust at you.
[346:53.72]I know.
[346:54.00]Hold on.
[346:54.26]I want to see what's down here.
[346:57.20]That was probably sleep.
[346:57.98]That was probably gonna be bad.
[346:58.72]Okay, nothing.
[347:14.50]And also make soap to reduce poison buildup before it's full.
[347:18.00]Can I wash it?
[347:19.16]Nah, I can't wash it off, right?
[347:25.65]Mmm, that doesn't look like it.
[347:35.45]Not after it fills.
[347:39.30]Wait, this shit over there.
[347:42.52]Ah, item.
[347:46.42]Remind me that that's there.
[347:50.12]Oh, I'm out of mana.
[348:14.06]Fuck.
[348:23.60]Cracked crystals.
[348:25.18]I don't think I've seen those before.
[348:27.32]Cracked crystal?
[348:44.31]Oh, that's not good.
[348:46.67]Lightning grease.
[348:49.43]My god, guys!
[348:50.51]What the fuck?
[348:51.19]Slow down!
[348:53.58]You're gonna poison yourselves.
[348:59.00]Got him in fuckin' midair.
[349:03.62]Okay, lightning grease.
[349:17.13]What's down here?
[349:22.66]Oh, it's an exploder!
[349:23.54]We're good.
[349:31.52]Ruined, strewn precipice.
[349:35.14]Okay.
[349:42.22]There was another way I could go in the cave.
[349:44.53]I think I'm gonna go back in the cave.
[349:49.86]Yeah, let's go back in the cave.
[349:55.68]There's something I did not explore in here.
[350:12.05]As I went...
[350:17.27]Yeah, alright.
[350:18.17]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[350:34.37]Oh, watch it!
[350:34.93]Watch it, watch it.
[350:59.01]Don't!
[351:04.15]Okay.
[351:05.85]What do you got?
[351:13.22]Well good, I replaced the one that I was a bonehead.
[351:15.72]And threw the fucking thing into the dirt.
[351:27.74]Did I go everywhere?
[351:29.52]Wait, there's that item that I wanted to get.
[351:32.70]On the elevator.
[351:42.90]Let me get the item on the elevator.
[351:44.12]Which was up there, right?
[351:50.63]No, I'm an idiot.
[351:52.39]Right, like here.
[351:53.80]Oh my god, it's not right there!
[351:55.34]Fucking come on, dude.
[351:57.28]Seriously, I thought I saw the light.
[352:01.45]I saw the light and I thought the light was the ledge.
[352:03.37]I was like, I don't want to miss it.
[352:06.07]It was way further down.
[352:08.99]It's right.
[352:09.45]It's okay.
[352:09.85]It's alright.
[352:10.19]It's right here.
[352:18.18]It's way lower.
[352:19.24]I saw the green light, the green lantern thing.
[352:23.79]Wait.
[352:24.59]Hold on.
[352:25.01]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[352:25.45]What's going on?
[352:26.43]That's not what I want to do.
[352:27.45]What's going on here?
[352:28.99]Wait, what's happening?
[352:30.54]Why is that here?
[352:32.38]Wait.
[352:32.78]What?
[352:33.20]I'm confused.
[352:33.80]What's going on?
[352:37.38]It was this cave.
[352:38.34]Yeah.
[352:38.82]What?
[352:39.08]Oh.
[352:39.28]We're good.
[352:57.34]Way higher.
[352:59.06]Okay.
[353:00.68]Slow down.
[353:30.20]Looks like another way to go, too.
[353:37.04]Yeah, I can't summon unless there's a boss or a statue nearby.
[353:40.30]I did not know that the whole time I've been playing.
[353:41.84]Alright, where is this fucking thing?
[353:44.60]Right here.
[353:49.85]What is it?
[353:56.81]Smithing Stone.
[353:57.99]Very cool.
[354:00.36]Wish it was a six.
[354:01.28]Isn't that right?
[354:16.41]Okay, that's it.
[354:26.26]So now... I can just go out.
[354:32.16]I want the souls.
[354:32.82]I'll kill them.
[354:41.73]Okay.
[354:46.49]So now let's go here.
[354:54.87]So should I go up or should I go... Should I be here?
[354:58.95]Maybe I should just... I wonder.
[355:01.81]What should I do?
[355:03.39]What should I do?
[355:07.01]Should I just go... Should I go up?
[355:16.59]I wonder if I should leave and just go... I don't know.
[355:21.69]There's two ways to go.
[355:26.03]I need to... Yeah, I also... I need a map too.
[355:28.11]I'm fucking lost like this.
[355:49.44]Okay.
[355:49.66]10,000 souls, don't be an idiot.
[355:50.42]I'm gonna go up.
[355:58.64]Was there something else that I could do here, though?
[356:00.34]I feel like I could.
[356:06.65]But, I'm just gonna go up.
[356:11.55]Yeah, I'll get it later.
[356:29.16]Not quite, but I'll get there.
[356:54.55]Why'd you turn back?
[356:55.25]I see you up there, you piece of shit.
[357:22.85]Land!
[357:26.41]Okay.
[357:37.40]Did you drop?
[357:42.28]Where did that guy go?
[357:42.86]Where'd that guy go?
[357:57.14]climb this?
[357:57.60]Can't jump over there.
[358:10.69]Somber Spinting Stone 3.
[358:12.05]That's not what I want.
[358:18.20]Nothing over.
[358:18.76]Okay.
[358:34.76]That's it.
[358:35.50]Nah, let's go down.
[358:38.46]Fall, fall, fall, fall.
[358:42.69]I don't want to lose this many souls, so I'm gonna say no to the fall joke.
[358:47.05]Sorry.
[358:47.39]Maybe some other time.
[358:52.50]That was one person that said that.
[359:07.01]Where the fuck am I even going?
[359:09.81]Um, okay.
[359:14.18]We're just gonna keep going up.
[359:19.98]Okay.
[359:38.68]Hey up there, oh Wait wait what what that was an NPC dude?
[360:18.45]Oh no, out of juice.
[360:21.77]Okay, was that the person singing?
[360:39.26]Alright, let's go motherfucker.
[360:45.63]You and me.
[360:51.65]Throwing sand.
[360:52.45]Throwing sand in my eyes.
[361:11.44]Get over here!
[361:14.86]Ugh!
[361:16.64]Ugh!
[361:24.69]Okay.
[361:28.77]Ooh, that's a big rune.
[361:29.85]That's a huge one.
[361:38.63]Come on, I don't have a sand.
[361:42.47]I don't think I ever got it.
[361:46.97]6 is at... it's 2500.
[361:48.35]I can definitely level up now then.
[362:02.92]I knew it.
[362:03.54]I knew you were going to show up.
[362:08.21]I was about to get knocked off.
[362:09.27]I don't know.
[362:31.27]I'm too nervous to go that way.
[362:33.45]Let me scale them out.
[362:41.97]There's going to be some asshole up here.
[362:52.67]I know it.
[362:53.11]I'm going to get to the top and there's going to be a boss and I'm going to kick its ass.
[362:57.50]I'm going to help you.
[363:00.72]I'm going to help you.
[363:18.29]Clear everything out first.
[363:19.23]There's two of them.
[363:21.43]They are creepy looking.
[363:22.61]Where are the slugs?
[363:42.14]Oh, get fucking stomped.
[363:51.61]Ah!
[363:56.11]Oh my goodness, dude.
[363:57.69]What are you doing?
[364:12.24]Yikes.
[364:16.99]I wish I had my fucking magic right now.
[364:18.49]It would be ideal.
[364:38.36]Motherfucker!
[364:43.92]Oh!
[364:48.52]Oh!
[365:18.84]No!
[365:19.28]No, no, no, no, no.
[365:20.08]I know that's gonna kill me.
[365:20.92]I'm gonna play very, very, very cautiously.
[365:28.07]Dude, this little fucking turret bullshit.
[365:30.57]Like, I swear to God.
[365:32.35]If I had my magic, you'd be toast.
[365:34.73]You wouldn't even live another single second of your life.
[365:38.29]You're lucky I don't have a mana potion.
[365:40.13]You piece of crap.
[365:41.59]You're lucky I don't have fucking flask.
[366:14.03]I got it.
[366:15.89]I got it.
[366:16.35]That was kind of horrible.
[366:20.49]Okay, I'm glad I can at least replace some of those.
[366:29.38]I would have felt real... Hold on over there.
[366:47.29]It's a big scary octopus thing.
[366:49.95]Hold on.
[366:50.47]Let me check it out.
[366:51.05]I don't even think about it.
[366:54.09]I know what you're gonna do.
[366:54.91]You're not gonna kill me.
[367:15.50]okay well okay okay serpent god's curved sword
[367:45.82]with this guy right now.
[367:46.93]Nope, we are not.
[368:21.95]Okay, we're good.
[368:25.80]Oh my god, he's still chasing me.
[368:33.04]See you later.
[368:41.18]Bye.
[368:47.34]You missed a Smithing Stone?
[368:48.42]I ain't going back up there for that.
[368:50.16]No, thank you.
[369:00.66]Continue going up.
[369:04.44]There's a fry on a flog on a log.
[369:07.64]There's a flea on the hair on the... There's a flea on the hair on the frog on the log on the dog on the bog on the bottom of the sea.
[369:14.12]There's a flea on the hair on the dog on the frog on the log on the bog on the bottom of the sea.
[369:26.41]There's probably a boss up here.
[369:31.85]I need 17.
[369:33.93]One more.
[369:34.35]17 what?
[369:34.77]That'll do it.
[369:42.00]I'm definitely... I gotta put points in health.
[369:43.74]It's getting pretty ugly.
[369:49.90]Without leaning forward.
[369:50.66]There's a... Lee on the hair, on the dog, on the frog, on the bog, on the log, at the bottom of the sea. ...
[370:06.07]Yep, alright, let's go.
[370:15.42]Who's there?
[370:16.08]Magma Wyrm Makar.
[370:34.62]He makes magma worms?!
[370:57.07]Sorry, I sneezed.
[370:57.77]Nose has been bothering me.
[371:05.14]I have fire resistance stuff on.
[371:06.64]I can get some fire resistance stuff.
[371:11.36]Fire.
[371:11.60]This one's 12.
[371:12.12]Okay.
[371:21.85]I want to keep this on, right?
[371:26.65]Fire?
[371:27.43]Anything better?
[371:28.03]Yeah.
[371:36.00]I know I have a fire resistant shield.
[371:37.60]Okay, this one's 49.
[371:41.24]59.
[371:42.48]Oh, I can't turn it on.
[371:43.52]Okay.
[371:45.40]28.
[371:47.26]Okay, I'm going to have to use... Yeah, this one.
[371:54.83]Okay, let's try that again.
[371:58.37]So he just runs around and has a bunch of fire all over him.
[372:02.12]So I gotta wait.
[372:02.86]Don't go in yet.
[372:04.04]Just kind of let him do his thing.
[372:06.50]How do you feel about the sorcerers?
[372:10.88]Not bad.
[372:19.13]Very slow.
[372:20.95]What about melee?
[372:23.25]My melee is way better against him.
[372:27.40]Alright, let him do his thing.
[372:28.30]We're going to run around.
[372:33.62]OK.
[372:38.59]On his side with a pillar, maybe?
[372:52.66]Oi!
[373:02.33]Ooh, that reach.
[373:06.57]Alright, around the pillow.
[373:07.27]Let's go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[373:08.25]Low and steady.
[373:25.88]Oh, get him under the water!
[373:28.24]It's genius!
[373:53.53]Watch that fire, dude.
[373:54.85]Don't be an idiot.
[374:03.64]Holy shit!
[374:04.02]He went all the way around.
[374:05.34]Uh-oh.
[374:48.92]Ugh!
[375:19.48]I don't know where the fuck I just was.
[375:50.87]Fuck, that's so long.
[376:25.34]Thank you.
[376:29.33]Behind that pillar.
[376:29.91]I don't like it when you're over here.
[377:14.45]Get away from the fire.
[377:15.15]He's gonna do his little bullshit move where he spins.
[377:45.01]so so
[378:03.16]OH!
[378:03.92]WHAT?!
[378:04.66]NO!
[378:06.20]ONE FUCKING HIT?!
[378:07.44]WHAT?!
[378:09.38]No way!
[378:13.28]WHAT?!
[378:19.43]Oh, I fucking dodged right through it!
[378:21.11]Damn it, man!
[378:23.19]Ayayay!
[378:28.21]I fucking had it right there, too.
[378:30.83]God, what's with the fucking instant kill bullshit?
[378:35.75]I fucking had it!
[378:37.01]Oh my god.
[378:39.21]What a fucking goddamn eye roll.
[378:51.50]Ugh.
[379:00.82]It looked like I dodged right through it, too.
[379:02.54]That was... It's not as... short.
[379:31.82]I need, like, 10 more points on Bidder.
[379:34.34]Seriously.
[379:51.80]Yeah, bad.
[380:01.21]Again with this bullshit?
[380:07.93]Fire right here.
[380:10.25]What the fuck?
[380:16.53]I'm so fine right now.
[380:17.65]I can't believe I didn't fucking kill him.
[380:50.31]Out of the fire.
[381:10.02]Come on, fucking camera, maybe dodge backwards a little bit.
[381:24.01]Alright, out of the fire, out!
[381:27.53]Out of the fire!
[381:42.06]Another full fucking goddamn second.
[381:52.53]I don't dodge into it this time.
[382:08.39]Thank you.
[382:35.19]Oh, there's fire there!
[382:36.33]There's fire over there!
[382:37.58]I just can't fucking see!
[383:02.04]Dude, I fucking didn't- What the fuck?
[383:05.32]I can't see!
[383:07.62]I- I apparently I queued up a heal and I just- I didn't have the animation time to dodge.
[383:16.69]God damn it.
[383:17.43]Okay, Oleg's gotta come out at second phase.
[383:22.49]It's just like when I dodged, I- I guess I pressed X. And it just queues up the heal when you get up.
[383:27.61]And I was just fucked at that point.
[383:36.46]And that move kills you in one hit.
[383:44.09]Ole comes out at phase two.
[383:59.06]Really?
[384:14.23]Oh you fucking piece of garbage.
[384:28.46]I might reset.
[384:43.43]Ah, I have to tell you that I... Yeah, I burnt through two flasks in the first 15 seconds.
[384:52.18]I gotta reset.
[385:00.00]Use the summon.
[385:00.52]I'm waiting for phase two.
[385:01.96]Dude.
[385:03.24]Phase two.
[385:04.48]He dies instantly in the fire here.
[385:29.18]I didn't mean to press X twice on full tilt.
[385:46.65]Thank you.
[386:23.33]You're not going to do it three times in a row, right?
[386:24.99]Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me.
[386:57.58]He slides forward, you fucking dick.
[387:25.67]Okay, he's going.
[387:26.37]Here we go.
[387:31.15]Go get him, Oleg.
[387:32.01]Come on, my boy.

[389:41.63]Oh fuck.
[389:43.09]Oh fuck.
[389:44.39]Oh fuck.
[389:45.97]He caught me with it again.
[389:47.21]Oh fuck.
[389:50.22]Oh fuck.
[389:51.26]Oh fuck.
[389:54.58]Fuck.
[389:56.50]Oh fuck.
[390:04.41]Shit!
[390:05.49]Porn sounds.
[390:08.38]It's just if he catches you with that but like trying to bait Trying to bait out that attack You get in and he swings three times the third time is the horrible one when you get in close to bait it It's like you can't it's like look at it's like I feel like I'm gonna fall over like Looking up at a fucking giant statue Okay
[390:36.45]The camera is your enemy in this game.
[390:38.03]Because when you're locked on, your eyes are just pointed like this.
[390:42.17]And it's like, okay, when is he coming down?
[390:48.16]Let's do this.
[390:49.48]Try this.
[390:56.25]I feel like there's a lot of time.
[390:57.35]I might be able to actually get one of these off.
[390:58.73]I wonder how much damage this does.
[390:59.65]I don't know.
[391:08.46]That's actually a lot, but it takes a while.
[391:17.83]What the fuck?
[391:45.95]Nope.
[391:46.99]Nope, takes too long.
[391:49.47]Takes too long, takes too long.
[392:08.66]Doesn't really do enough damage either.
[392:11.52]I'm gonna stick with what I was doing.
[392:25.03]Walk on!
[392:28.44]You're at least gonna get stuck there.
[392:39.48]Maybe I can shoot him.
[393:04.07]Oh, boy.
[393:04.83]No, no, no, no, no.
[393:06.83]I get caught.
[393:08.21]Sometimes he does it, like, three times in a row.
[393:11.27]I'm in trouble now.
[393:13.15]Yeah, the magic's not... The magic's not gonna cut it.
[393:16.96]Maybe at the end, if I could stay back.
[393:21.84]Not worth it, though.
[393:28.48]Dude.
[393:28.84]Oh, my fucking God.
[393:29.68]Oh, my God.
[393:36.55]Off to the front!
[393:38.15]I'm dead.
[393:44.36]I'm dead.
[393:46.98]I'm gonna die.
[393:53.60]Yeah, I'm dead.
[393:56.18]That was a sloppy one.
[394:10.84]That's a sloppy one.
[394:11.48]Alright, so he... I'm trying to see if he like... Yeah, that's a sloppy one.
[394:22.94]How much damage does this do?
[394:23.86]A lot.
[394:35.25]I think it's time for jump R2s on this guy.
[394:38.25]But, it'd be hard to do this.
[394:51.16]He can't dodge through that.
[394:52.18]Is he gonna get hit by the hitbox that lasts?
[395:03.16]Well, just practice.
[395:21.66]He's still alive.
[395:48.74]I just don't know where the fuck I am!
[395:56.55]Like he puts his hands all the way over his head so even looking up it's like I can't see his fucking arms.
[396:10.95]Last try last try last try and then I'm gonna go eat some food.
[396:18.80]I Need to eat something I need to eat food I have to come back refreshed
[396:51.47]Yeah, I waited so fucking long too.
[396:53.56]My god, you guys take an eternity to do moves in this game.
[397:26.15]I knew you were going to do that.
[397:40.82]Damn it.
[397:41.12]I tried to dodge through it again.
[397:42.30]It didn't do it.
[397:43.00]Can't dodge through that when he puts it in his mouth.
[398:24.73]Oh, what?
[398:25.41]Don't even.
[398:40.94]Seriously, dude.
[398:41.75]Really?

[401:09.95]Dude, what the fuck am I?
[401:12.49]Seriously?
[401:38.93]Oh!
[402:14.19]Dude, I fucking... It's so annoying.
[402:16.82]Like, I just don't know where the fuck he even is.
[402:20.04]Walking on, not walking on.
[402:21.44]His hands go all the way into the air into the ceiling.
[402:41.08]Get away from me, you fucker!
[402:44.66]You fucker!
[402:47.88]You motherfucker!
[403:21.56]Eat cheese for breakfast, you fucking piece of shit!
[403:34.37]You're gonna get diarrhea in the fucking morning, I guarantee it!
[403:57.20]No, oh no, I'm running out of juice Fuck you stop missing god damn it.
[404:20.97]Oh
[404:28.04]I'm playing this so fucking safe, you have no idea.
[404:30.02]You're gonna give me the cheese hall of fame for this one.
[404:33.75]What?
[404:38.05]Oh shit.
[404:41.11]What does this weapon power do?
[405:01.69]so
[405:28.45]Fuck you, game.
[405:31.31]I'm gonna smoke that cheese all the way to the bank.
[405:34.89]Oh my god.
[405:35.75]That was so scary.
[405:43.07]I cheesed him, but we know what, whatever.
[405:51.42]What was that?
[406:00.27]Agmaworm Scalesword.
[406:01.53]De-scaling.
[406:06.03]Agmageity.
[406:08.79]What?
[406:10.01]Let's see.
[406:13.22]I need... Wait, I have to sit down.
[406:29.15]It's not cheese.
[406:30.11]Well, I 50%.
[406:32.03]Whoa.
[406:36.51]What the hell?
[406:42.84]That's actually kind of cool.
[406:43.92]Alright.
[406:44.40]I mean, I didn't really cheese him.
[406:46.28]I pursued him correctly and I killed him.
[406:51.56]Alright, let me level up and then let me think about eating something.
[407:02.07]Some of the moves are follow-up moves.
[407:23.96]Fire is supposed to come out.
[407:25.02]Maybe I can't wield it.
[407:30.69]I'm trying to do a bunch of combinations.
[407:32.01]Yeah, I don't know.
[407:36.55]I think it's a Twitch problem because this has been happening consistently all night.
[407:42.47]This is not an internet problem.
[407:43.51]Somebody said that other people were having problems too.
[407:45.79]Yeah, I don't meet the requirements to use it.
[407:49.01]Alright, so what else is over here?
[407:55.57]What else is going on here before I stop?
[408:08.61]Let's check out over here.
[408:09.35]Alright, so the plan is I'm probably going to... I don't know.
[408:15.93]I want to try to kill that goddamn guy.
[408:18.03]Alright, here's the plan.
[408:22.98]I'm going to give it like three attempts to go fight that other dude.
[408:30.70]Yeah, wreck the dam.
[408:33.99]I'm gonna go try... Okay, I've got more flasks.
[408:36.35]I've got more health.
[408:37.29]I've got more everything.
[408:38.27]I'm gonna... Let me try it.
[408:50.18]First, let me... Atlas Plateau.
[408:53.97]Okay.
[408:54.09]This is really pretty.
[409:00.98]Did I get any six smithing stones?
[409:02.98]I don't think I did.
[409:06.64]This is four.
[409:13.09]Let me just touch the bonfire here.
[409:14.19]There's probably one right here somewhere.
[409:26.35]There it is.
[409:26.69]Okay.
[409:28.20]I'm not going to do this area.
[409:29.34]Not yet.
[409:30.44]What I'm going to do is I'm going to go check it out.
[409:34.44]See if I can do it reliably in one or two attempts.
[409:37.63]Then I'm going to stop the stream.
[409:38.73]I'm going to eat.
[409:39.65]And I'll be back tomorrow.
[409:41.55]I think.
[409:43.27]I think so.
[409:55.28]Can I level anything up?
[410:06.13]I did have a lot of those crushes.
[410:08.19]Yeah, I think I actually might be able to get there.
[410:09.61]It's 4,000.
[410:14.61]I'll be close.
[410:18.98]I need a little bit more.
[410:27.12]Alright, let me just get, I'll kill some people.
[410:28.20]Is there people out here?
[410:32.22]Like right here?
[410:32.62]There's people like, yeah, we're going to go to the farming zone.
[410:44.86]Which is not... Okay, yeah.
[410:50.30]Just enough to get... I want to get Vitality up another point.
[410:52.74]I'm trying to get... I want to get to like 25 or 30.
[410:53.92]We need like 18,000.
[410:56.68]Something like that.
[411:07.93]Okay.
[411:18.57]Alright, alright, easy.
[411:26.10]You just knocked me off my fucking horse?
[411:37.74]Oh, you don't even move that far.
[411:38.92]Get out of here.
[411:47.10]Alright, there's 14.
[411:50.89]Alright, I need to throw headphones in because of being a dumbass.
[412:01.71]Alright.
[412:25.14]Ow!
[412:26.22]Stop it!
[412:49.79]Oh my god, they weren't even trying to kill me and they got me.
[413:04.28]Alright, what do I need now?
[413:16.81]I need like a thousand, two thousand.
[413:24.87]One or two more of these dogs will do it, I think.
[413:28.13]Let's go ahead and just make this easy on ourselves.
[413:30.63]Why don't we?
[413:33.95]That doesn't stagger the dog.
[413:35.63]I thought it did.
[413:46.51]Okay, I'm gonna die if I'm not-
[413:54.51]Okay, just back up, back up, back up, back up, back up. Run away.
[414:18.81]Whoa!
[414:19.33]Easy.
[414:20.43]Who the fuck are you?
[414:21.07]Okay, we're almost there.
[414:27.37]Almost there.
[414:29.15]Put on your old gear.
[414:33.60]Yeah, that's a good point.
[414:35.10]That's a very good point.
[414:38.24]Let's just respawn everybody one more time.
[414:41.88]Alright, we're giving it three attempts.
[414:44.08]That's it, I promise.
[414:45.02]Three attempts and that's it.
[414:49.63]I'm just going to do the thing I was doing before.
[414:51.67]I'm going to go for it.
[414:52.97]I got some extra levels.
[414:54.19]If I can't do it, I'll do it again another time.
[415:16.59]so
[415:34.35]Okay, I think I'm there.
[415:35.03]I don't wanna get too many.
[415:37.10]Yeah, I'm definitely there.
[415:40.20]Alright, let's go.
[415:40.58]Get out.
[415:45.32]Still getting chased?
[415:56.26]Alright.
[415:57.46]Here we go.
[415:58.30]Let's give it a few tries.
[415:59.38]I'm only going to try it a few times.
[416:00.96]I'm not going to do anything stupid.
[416:07.82]Okay.
[416:08.54]Are you ready?
[416:11.31]We good?
[416:15.07]I got to change my flasks.
[416:17.85]What kind of damage is he doing?
[416:23.48]Parianites, I think, is good all around.
[416:26.74]Would it be, like, slashing?
[416:29.54]He has magic, too, though.
[416:33.52]He has that, like, wave of magic.
[416:37.28]Hmm.
[416:49.47]I'll put the... These are good.
[416:54.64]Still in the drilling, right?
[416:55.38]Yep.
[416:55.50]Yeah, that's good.
[416:58.66]Potency of sorceries restores HP.
[417:00.48]Do I have any, like, lightning damage?
[417:04.76]Holy damage or something?
[417:05.82]Reduction?
[417:06.22]I think that's good.
[417:09.69]Okay.
[417:12.65]Here we go.
[417:14.59]Are you okay?
[417:15.39]Um, yeah, I'm fine.
[417:16.47]This game's hard and frustrating.
[417:23.02]Alright.
[417:23.92]Three attempts, and then I'm calling it a night.
[417:28.42]And then we'll come back to it probably tomorrow.
[417:29.56]I need to get some food.
[417:41.30]Do the dragon powers?
[417:42.34]We'll do that tomorrow.
[417:42.94]I just want to see if I can get this done.
[417:53.15]What happens if you beat him on your first try?
[417:54.47]I mean... I'm still... I'm still gonna probably leave.
[418:02.52]Can I open these?
[418:05.50]Uh... Wait, what's going on?
[418:14.14]Oh, do I have to say yes to him?
[418:15.38]I do, don't I?
[418:15.92]A celebration of war!
[418:24.72]Everybody, I need total silence for this.
[418:29.92]I need complete 100% total silence.
[418:33.48]If anybody does a chat message, I'll hear it and it'll freak me out.
[418:42.02]No chatting.
[418:43.06]No messages.
[418:45.10]Done.
[418:47.24]Okay, let's go.
[418:49.48]Three attempts.
[419:14.58]Let's go.
[419:25.51]Oh, fuck.
[419:28.59]Good.
[419:54.17]Everybody get in!
[420:44.33]Alright, let's go find some more summoning signs.
[420:45.55]Is that too far away?
[420:57.10]Nope.
[421:24.22]I need those signs right now, please!
[421:26.67]Right there.
[422:00.38]Or the other ones in here somewhere.
[422:55.79]Where's the meteor?
[423:03.49]Thank you.
[423:32.28]Get those fucking meatballs away from me, Grant.
[423:34.14]Get them away.
[423:47.11]I need more summons.
[423:47.77]Where are they?
[423:49.39]I gotta go find them.
[423:51.07]There's only like three people there.
[423:52.01]Are they up on the top of the hill?
[424:08.68]Let's go.
[424:09.06]I don't know what the hell that was, but I don't want to be part of that.
[424:37.67]Alright, there's one down there.
[424:38.55]Alright, let's go.
[424:43.91]Let's see if I can get a couple hits.
[425:01.60]Where is it?
[425:02.18]Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[425:30.17]Oh man, here they come!
[425:38.21]What?
[425:39.11]I get hit by two?
[425:42.12]What hit me?
[425:42.56]I get hit by two of them?
[425:45.00]What?
[425:49.48]Aye aye aye, dude.
[425:55.52]What the fuck?
[425:58.01]Alright, well this is a major problem I'm already seeing here.
[426:01.59]Here's the huge problem.
[426:02.85]I should not have seven fucking flasks.
[426:05.63]This is a huge problem.
[426:09.39]It's a big problem.
[426:17.37]Two healing potions.
[426:18.52]I should not be hit more than one or two times ever.
[426:28.04]Try it again.
[426:31.34]If one hits you, you're going to get one shot.
[426:33.48]Yeah, I...
[426:36.19]It's weird because sometimes he gets into range and they don't attack me.
[426:40.47]They just kind of still sit there.
[426:41.61]I wonder what the actual timing is on having them actually attack.
[426:45.21]Sometimes it just feels kind of random.
[426:48.55]I'll be close to him and he won't... The NPCs were all over him and they weren't firing.
[426:54.40]Shouldn't even need to take one healing potion.
[426:59.70]Yeah, but you know, I'm going to take two.
[427:05.77]Oh my god, I have to say yes to him again.
[427:10.59]They shoot you if you get too far away.
[427:12.93]I mean, sometimes I'm across the whole map.
[427:22.18]They don't fire if you're in melee range.
[427:27.46]Accurate?
[427:31.66]He roars, that's how you know he does it, really.
[427:42.49]Do I have the right armor?
[427:43.31]I don't really have anything else that's better.
[427:44.68]I have, like, the Carrion Knight stuff, which is just kind of generally just good all around.
[427:49.42]I should use a Rune Arc for this.
[427:51.78]Alright, I'm gonna use a Rune Arc, and hopefully it doesn't come back and bite me in the ass.
[427:55.64]I'm using one right now.
[427:56.47]Alright.
[427:58.67]If I die immediately to this first thing, I'm gonna... I'm gonna be very upset.
[428:06.47]Okay, here we go.
[428:08.53]This is the one.
[428:09.23]This is actually the one.
[428:10.33]We're going to do it right here.
[428:11.23]This is the one.
[428:12.49]This is copium and that's fine.
[428:17.03]Thought it was going to hit me.
[428:57.97]And What the fuck bro Okay, bro
[429:08.29]What are you fucking doing?
[429:18.98]You fucking piece of shit.
[429:25.89]Are you fucking kidding me?
[430:09.68]I'm gonna go back around.
[430:39.78]Is somebody still alive up there?
[430:40.88]Who's even alive up there?
[430:44.48]I thought he was still alive.
[430:52.44]It's bad.
[430:53.48]It's okay.
[430:53.72]It's alright.
[431:27.39]Okay, fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
[431:42.06]Where is he going?
[431:48.05]I don't know which way he went!
[431:49.31]I don't know which way he went!
[431:50.87]Oh, we're good.
[431:52.21]Thanks, man.
[431:55.37]Actually, I have no idea where the fuck he is.
[432:13.69]I do... I don't know, I don't...
[432:20.03]I'm not in melee range and they're not firing at me, though.
[432:29.55]Why are they not firing?
[432:30.89]Let's see if you're in... Not in melee range?
[432:33.36]Whatever it was.
[432:37.34]Or if I get in melee range, what happens?
[432:40.74]I don't understand.
[432:42.28]I'm fucked.
[432:46.05]Only fire during certain moves.
[432:47.49]Oh, okay.
[432:47.71]Alright, alright, alright.
[432:50.43]Oh.
[432:52.15]My god.
[432:56.31]Do I have to get off the horse?
[433:02.53]Jesus.
[433:03.17]Fucking hell, man.
[433:08.36]Even if I didn't look at chat, like, I... Why'd you stop shooting?
[433:11.00]Because I... It's... You stand so still.
[433:15.71]Roll them?
[433:16.33]I'm on the horse.
[433:19.16]Get off the horse and roll them.
[433:22.38]Is that like worth getting off the horse and just like just sitting there and waiting till he fires them?
[433:26.54]I lost the Lunar.
[433:44.06]I can't use Invernarch until I get that down.
[433:46.59]It's like I just don't understand it.
[433:49.75]Is it just get off the horse?
[433:51.11]I don't even know what the timing's like either.
[434:23.26]Yeah, it's my horse Holly sick for the horse to respond without a hill I
[434:31.61]I'm hitting him with a fucking staff!
[434:35.81]Doesn't... That's not good.
[434:40.93]I'm gonna get off the horse and I'm gonna dodge those things.
[434:57.00]Jesus Christ.
[435:17.28]He's too far away, I think.
[435:20.45]Not quite.
[435:37.44]Come here.
[435:44.18]Did I get it?
[435:44.74]I have no idea.
[435:45.45]I think so.
[435:51.87]Are they up here?
[435:59.42]Yeah, they are.
[436:06.77]Just fucking summon everybody, whatever.
[436:08.13]He's not gonna despawn.
[436:30.85]Thank you.
[437:11.31]You're coming for me still.
[437:12.75]That's not cool.
[437:18.65]What do I do to you?
[437:19.25]Leave me alone.
[437:20.18]Okay.
[437:29.42]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[437:34.65]Move, move men.
[437:36.55]Alright, get off the horse.
[438:23.46]Huh?
[438:28.98]Oh fuck!
[438:50.61]Dude, what the fuck am I supposed to do about this motherfucker?
[438:53.89]He's coming for me a third time!
[438:56.77]I can't get on the horse fast enough afterwards, dude.
[438:59.36]Of course he had to do that move.
[439:11.34]Get back on the horse?
[439:12.06]Yeah, it takes three or four seconds.
[439:16.54]Stay on the horse and dodge the meatballs.
[439:18.41]Can you, though?
[439:19.33]I feel like they're homing missiles.
[439:25.33]Fucking sorcery, man.
[439:29.60]Horse mount has iframes.
[439:31.64]Could I theoretically... Okay, could I theoretically get on the horse when he shoots them?
[439:36.90]Is that possible?
[439:39.40]Probably could, right?
[439:40.85]At least a second.
[439:42.87]Maybe?
[439:45.69]I think that's the play.
[439:49.84]Dude, I- and the fucking home.
[439:51.46]Just kill me now.
[439:52.96]It's so frustrating.
[439:53.86]It's like, dude, like, does it have to be home to my body going that fast?
[439:57.82]Like, I was trying to get it to hit the fucking thing.
[440:11.78]Hopping on the horse has the rolling iframes.
[440:13.99]I'm going to try to dodge the first one and then get on the horse when he shoots the second one.
[440:21.80]That should do it.
[440:23.14]And that should be it.
[440:24.02]That should be the one.
[440:24.80]That should literally be the one.
[440:25.84]Go eat.
[440:30.23]Yeah, I'm done after this.
[440:34.44]I would love to beat him before I do this bullshit tomorrow.
[440:37.28]Because I don't ever want to fucking fight this guy again.
[440:40.26]I'll put GameShark in.
[440:42.52]And like skip this boss on my next playthrough.
[441:05.53]You're not gonna do it again, are you?
[441:06.77]Uh, yes you are.
[441:08.91]Alright, let's go.
[441:23.24]I got really screwed on the first few arrows too.
[441:40.31]Are you fucking kidding me?
[442:27.02]I'm going to summon.
[442:28.92]I'm going to move.
[442:36.31]Here.
[442:40.03]Come on, where are you at?
[442:40.83]Over here.
[442:42.41]Where are they?
[442:42.89]Oh, come on.
[442:46.31]Where are you?
[442:46.83]Where are you?
[442:48.13]Where are you?
[442:48.61]Where are you?
[442:48.97]Where are you?
[442:49.35]There you are.
[443:08.00]Whoa!
[443:09.34]Come over here.
[443:28.75]Thank you.
[444:06.93]I can't do anything like that.
[444:11.14]E-gads.
[444:11.70]I mean, that's the... E-gads.
[444:13.20]Like, seriously.
[444:20.30]There he goes.
[444:20.78]He's going up.
[444:39.31]Every time I scream, it doesn't matter.
[444:40.55]I don't care.
[445:00.45]Oh shit, okay, okay, okay, here we go, here we go.
[445:03.03]Here we go, here we go, here we go.
[445:04.11]I think I can jump.
[445:22.88]Oh fuck, he's coming for me.
[445:43.69]Don't work.
[445:44.67]Don't work.
[445:47.55]Don't work.
[445:49.05]Don't work.
[445:49.53]You gotta... Dodge, dodge.
[445:51.30]Call.
[445:51.92]Don't work.
[445:57.60]You have to attack him?
[446:00.89]I... I know.
[446:02.35]But I want to get summons.
[446:10.38]That second phase is so hard for this character because I don't have that many points in melee.
[446:20.08]I mean, I'm getting up in there, but then the meatballs are going to fire.
[446:24.07]This guy just is fucking hell.
[446:33.30]Maybe I need more endurance or something.
[446:34.94]I don't know.
[446:47.47]Suck my ass.
[446:48.35]Like, honestly.
[446:49.73]Like, fuck you.
[446:54.25]Are you gonna do that shit again?
[446:55.39]Are you gonna fire?
[446:55.77]Are you gonna do it again?
[446:56.41]Of course you are.
[446:58.35]Why would you do anything else?
[446:59.19]I didn't even summon these guys either.
[447:28.39]Can't even get fucking close I can't how do I approach him?
[447:35.55]Like I was gonna go and do melee attack Fucking hell
[447:55.66]Okay.
[447:57.68]I gotta stick with the same strategy, because, like, honest to god, melee might be a good idea.
[448:03.57]But, hear me out, I've fought this guy for four fucking hours, and I have no idea what those timings are.
[448:09.98]I have to try to beat him the way that I'm doing with sorcery.
[448:14.74]It's probably like... I could probably do it, right?
[448:17.08]But he's on the horse, though.
[448:17.96]I feel like he's moving around so much faster than you could... How do you close the gap if you do melee?
[448:23.17]Just horse melee?
[448:23.85]I don't know.
[448:25.59]I feel like that's hard.
[448:32.88]Okay.
[448:55.98]Can't go forward on that.
[448:58.08]I gotta get at least one more decent attempt before I follow him.
[449:09.15]Yeah, Patches doesn't do anything.
[449:10.59]Why am I even summoning Patches?
[449:11.76]He's a fucking piece of shit.
[449:12.62]He didn't do anything.
[449:19.79]Let's try... I gotta get at least... I gotta get one more solid attempt.
[449:24.23]Okay.
[449:54.03]Why am I, how am I fucking this up again?
[449:57.39]I understand what I'm doing wrong here.
[450:38.92]Where's the cavalry?
[451:07.45]Somebody just got a- somebody got a fucking backstab on him.
[451:08.65]What?
[451:08.75]Holy shit, somebody just saved the day.
[451:09.53]Alright, relax.
[451:09.81]Relax, relax, relax.
[451:10.45]Where do I go?
[451:10.73]Where does he come from?
[451:11.25]Where does he come from?
[451:11.73]Where does he go?
[451:12.15]Where does he come from?
[451:12.65]Where does he go?
[451:12.99]Where does he come from?
[451:13.57]Where does he go?
[451:23.00]There he is.
[451:32.00]Oh fucking come on.
[451:34.00]Not immediately!
[451:41.56]I need summons too.
[451:42.69]Oh, I'm in deep trouble now.
[451:44.01]Come on, do it now.
[451:44.81]Let me dodge them both and get on the horse quick.
[451:52.81]You had to do that.
[451:53.35]I couldn't... We're good.
[451:55.27]We're good.
[451:55.49]It's fine.
[451:55.75]It's fine.
[451:55.99]It's fine.
[452:05.52]Oh, you fucking gotta be kidding me.
[452:08.27]Do it!
[452:10.19]Do the move, please!
[452:11.37]Do the move, please!
[452:12.27]Do the move!
[452:28.36]Asshole, do it!
[452:30.60]Is that it?
[452:31.32]That's not it!
[452:37.00]so so so
[453:25.29]Thank you.
[453:58.78]What?
[454:52.19]Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[455:24.89]That was too hard.
[455:25.87]That was too much.
[455:26.95]I don't like that one.
[455:28.12]I'm not doing that anymore.
[455:31.14]I'm not gonna play that one anymore.
[455:32.66]That one was too hard.
[455:34.63]Too hard for me.
[455:35.73]I think I've done it.
[455:56.40]I look like shit, man.
[455:57.76]I've looked like shit this whole fucking day.
[456:03.24]I look like shit.
[456:10.41]You know what?
[456:11.29]It looks like this whole time I've been upside down and I haven't told you yet.
[456:15.94]You know what I mean?
[456:17.32]I look like I'm hanging upside down.
[456:26.93]Like, all that's gonna happen is eventually this thing's gonna flip and you're gonna be like, holy shit, this guy's been live for seven and a half hours streaming upside down?
[456:32.93]Damn.
[456:37.99]Oh, that was fucking horrible.
[456:40.37]I was waiting for you.
[456:42.09]What a sick way to fight, eh?
[456:44.45]The glory of the clash is shared.
[456:47.17]By Radan.
[456:48.35]No, that guy was an asshole.
[456:49.63]That guy sucked.
[456:50.45]There was no glory in that.
[456:51.91]Afterwards, a falling star right before our eyes.
[456:55.80]I can't fathom how Rodan was holding back something of that scale.
[456:59.42]He was a living legend if ever I saw one.
[457:02.08]And the path has now been cleared.
[457:03.97]To Nokland.
[457:05.23]Where Ranni's fate will be decided.
[457:07.33]Let's meet where the falling star bit the Earth.
[457:10.11]We'll take up our souls once more.
[457:11.77]You should get some food.
[457:12.67]I don't even know what this guy's name is.
[457:17.86]Okay.
[457:19.46]I have 70,000 souls.
[457:22.22]Let's keep talking.
[457:22.80]Hold on, we're not done.
[457:23.65]Let's meet with a fallen star with the Earth.
[457:26.33]My only purpose is to fight for Ranni's fate.
[457:28.89]So we're going to go with it with a star fell to the Earth.
[457:32.93]And the final act.
[457:35.34]OK.
[457:35.42]What about the pot guy?
[457:43.96]Ah, hello there.
[457:47.14]Oh, it was a battle marvelously fought.
[457:50.51]You are well and truly a champion friend.
[457:53.76]I, on the other hand, am nothing but a crock.
[457:57.92]One hit was all it took.
[457:59.00]We'll come back tomorrow strong, and I'm not going to get angry tomorrow, I promise.
[458:03.24]After that, I hid like a coward.
[458:07.88]And as such, I can hardly stand to face one such as you.
[458:14.72]You did good.
[458:16.39]I want to know who parried him and fucking crit him.
[458:19.67]Somebody fucking saved this whole stream.
[458:21.29]I don't know who it was.
[458:22.09]Somebody parried him.
[458:22.61]Like, which one of you dickheads did that?
[458:23.65]I want to look back and see who did that.
[458:25.01]Hmm.
[458:44.25]Just you wait and see, friend.
[458:46.29]I'll grow even stronger.
[458:48.49]Just you wait when next we meet.
[458:50.91]We should be friends.
[458:51.63]I don't want to fight anybody anymore.
[458:52.99]Can I just like go ahead?
[458:54.57]I'll throw in the towel and just like kind of watch the rest of the time.
[458:59.63]Here, like you just take my staff and I'll just like ride on your back and just you play and whatever.
[459:05.14]Yeah, you can be the Elden Lord.
[459:06.26]It's like this.
[459:07.92]It's way too much stress.
[459:08.98]You know what I mean?
[459:09.68]Like I did my, I killed Radan.
[459:13.35]Only we did.
[459:13.91]I know I'm taking credit for that, which is kind of fucked up.
[459:15.81]Okay.
[459:16.17]So I'm good.
[459:16.41]So let's activate this.
[459:16.89]I'm going to level up, and then I'll see you tomorrow.
[459:39.06]He's too old FromSoftware anymore.
[459:41.00]Sage, he's too old for FromSoftware.
[459:43.10]What?
[459:46.12]This fight is so hard.
[459:49.06]It's just so much.
[459:50.30]It's like your brain, like, knows what you have to do.
[459:53.78]But you just won't, it won't do it.
[459:55.58]And then I just want, I so badly wanted my brain to do certain things.
[460:00.44]And he's, he's a, he's a righteous piece of shit.
[460:03.32]Like, I'll be honest.
[460:04.98]He is a righteous piece of shit.
[460:07.51]That was... That was just... That was rough.
[460:09.93]That was rough.
[460:11.75]That guy's a righteous piece of shit.
[460:17.19]I think... Uh... I think I gotta just stack Vitality at this point.
[460:22.00]Just try to get it to 30.
[460:25.96]Either that, or we put up Dex.
[460:38.32]Harder than Sekiro?
[460:39.96]No, it's different.
[460:42.60]It's, I don't know.
[460:44.66]It's definitely very difficult, but they give you enough tools to make it so you'll get it.
[460:51.45]In Sekiro, your only tool was being able to hit L1 at the right time.
[460:57.05]That was it.
[460:58.43]So, alright, you got these summons, you got these magical spells, you got a horse, right?
[461:01.97]There's a lot of ways to go about playing this game.
[461:08.16]Sekiro, you had to do one thing, and you had to do it well.
[461:10.64]Otherwise, it was over.
[461:18.37]Am I gonna be able to get to that staff?
[461:25.47]Okay, I'm gonna do... I'm gonna regret that later, but fuck it.
[461:29.39]Whatever.
[461:39.32]What do I need for some of this stuff?
[461:41.16]That staff is 52.
[461:43.66]Which, with my equipment on, it's 33.
[461:45.62]With this thing on, it's 36.
[461:50.80]So, I could definitely get there.
[461:55.77]Gotta get bigger to 25, yeah.
[461:57.57]That's the plan now.
[462:00.01]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[462:02.67]He looks like he's stressed out.
[462:04.07]I'm just tired.
[462:11.49]Helm nerfs your HP and stamp.
[462:13.73]Yeah, it does.
[462:16.97]That was crazy.
[462:18.29]That was crazy.
[462:18.81]I definitely need some protein or something.
[462:21.53]I'm currently melting.
[462:23.68]I don't understand what's going on with the internet stuff.
[462:25.56]I think it's a Twitch problem, but if it's not, then that's kind of frustrating too.
[462:31.44]Alright.
[462:32.42]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[462:33.06]We'll start at somewhere around 4 o'clock.
[462:37.42]And we'll go from there.
[462:40.68]That was Elden Ring.
[462:43.32]Part 5.
[462:49.28]Good night.
[462:49.62]See you later.
[462:51.48]It turned purple.
[462:56.80]I did.
[463:02.86]Beat the game?
[463:03.56]What?
[463:03.76]No.
[463:05.18]Not even close.
[463:05.82]I'm probably a thousand years away from beating it.
[463:13.31]I couldn't watch any of the stream because I'm playing it myself, but listening to this just sounded like you were on a water park ride from hell.
[463:23.82]That guy was hell.
[463:30.28]That was absolute hell.
[463:35.87]What?
[463:36.27]He's dead?
[463:39.21]And we can keep going.
[463:45.78]Yeah, this has been Complain Andy.
[463:49.14]The guy that complains about the game the whole time he's playing it.
[463:55.01]What I'm known for.
[463:56.91]Follow the streams and you'll see tomorrow.
[464:04.37]Complain Andy Part 6.
[464:05.68]That's a good title.
[464:10.00]Yeah, see you tomorrow at 4 o'clock.
[464:12.81]Much love to you.
[464:13.23]Thanks for hanging out.
[464:13.79]I know these go late.
[464:15.43]But I'm very much in the grind set right now.
[464:18.11]And I'm going to be back prepared tomorrow.
[464:20.16]Tomorrow I'm going to lock in.
[464:25.56]I wasn't locked in today.
[464:26.74]I got to lock in tomorrow.
[464:31.22]I'll see you tomorrow.
[464:31.76]Thanks for watching.
[464:32.34]Thanks for putting up with my bullshit as always.
[464:33.72]See you tomorrow.
[465:09.32]Thank you.
[465:44.26]you
