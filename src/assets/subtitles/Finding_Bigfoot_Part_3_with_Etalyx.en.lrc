[00:01.75]Hello, everybody.
[00:07.53]Have a great day.
[00:09.57]Goodbye.
[00:09.99]No, no, no, no.
[00:14.02]That was the Windows.
[00:16.04]Those of you guys that are old enough to remember, that's the Windows 95.
[00:19.80]Turn off the computer sound.
[00:24.08]No.
[00:24.30]Hey, how you doing?
[00:26.06]Tonight, well, not tonight.
[00:27.46]It's technically day.
[00:29.47]Got another quick one for you.
[00:33.58]Got another quick two-hour stream for you today.
[00:38.32]Me and Etalyx are gonna play the Yeti game, or the Bigfoot game.
[00:41.84]It's been renamed to just Bigfoot, no longer Finding Bigfoot.
[00:45.89]This one has a Yeti in it, and it's a snow level.
[00:51.03]So I wonder if we will, uh... I wonder if we'll be able to find it in an hour and 40 minutes.
[00:59.46]But, yes, that's what's happening.
[01:01.40]If you aren't aware...
[01:04.30]Why the short streams, dude?
[01:05.64]What the fuck, man?
[01:08.18]It's because this is the week that I'll be in Vegas.
[01:11.44]I'm leaving.
[01:14.20]An airplane is involved.
[01:15.70]Just want to make sure an airplane is involved.
[01:17.42]Get on the airplane.
[01:19.86]I'm going to go zoom it across the country.
[01:21.14]I'm going to get off the plane.
[01:24.03]And deal with a bunch of fucking realtors, which has been so much fucking fun, by the way.
[01:35.79]I could go off on, like, I'm... Wait.
[01:37.93]Tal, is he here?
[01:40.77]He's not here.
[01:42.65]We just... We just had a realtor situation.
[01:48.59]And he'll be here in a second.
[01:51.95]You know, some realtors just don't give a fuck about you.
[01:54.38]and he'll ghost you literally a day before your trip to Las Vegas!
[02:00.87]That happens sometimes, apparently!
[02:03.09]Hello?
[02:03.81]Oh, hi!
[02:04.35]Oh, I'm talking about getting ghosted by realtors.
[02:06.11]Isn't it fun?
[02:09.15]Don't get everybody worried on your behalf, you know?
[02:11.75]Everything's fine.
[02:12.97]This is gonna be great.
[02:15.13]Dude, we've been ghosted by realtors so many times at this point, I could start up Mario Kart and have a full fucking race versus all the ghosts.
[02:22.95]You know what I'm saying?
[02:26.31]That's good.
[02:26.83]You still got the video game reference on point.
[02:28.89]I still got the video game reference on point.
[02:33.00]Anyways, no, we're all good.
[02:34.52]Anyways.
[02:35.36]Everything's fine.
[02:35.76]We're playing a game called Yetiville.
[02:38.46]I just want to make sure everyone's clear, like Taloc said.
[02:41.85]We're good to go.
[02:43.89]If those of you have no idea, we're going to be room buddies.
[02:47.47]Well, not in the same room.
[02:48.15]Basically, it's difficult to move across the country.
[02:50.17]Yeah.
[02:51.58]It's difficult to move across the country and baby slamming his fists on table right now.
[02:58.31]But that's why we're going to be gone for like a week.
[03:00.39]Yes.
[03:01.75]Because that's how long it's going to take.
[03:03.61]We're not going to be around for a full week because we got to lock it in, man.
[03:09.64]Basically, life is difficult.
[03:11.46]Yes.
[03:12.00]But it's climbing over those hills and putting your hand up over your head and just looking left and right on Everest and being like, holy shit, this was worth it.
[03:22.45]Look at all this stuff.
[03:23.39]I can see my house for you.
[03:24.57]Could I see my house from Everest?
[03:25.96]What do you think?
[03:28.16]From Everest?
[03:28.74]Yeah, like I'm standing on top of Everest.
[03:30.90]Isn't Everest not even the tallest mountain in the world?
[03:33.16]Isn't it just the tallest one that people climb?
[03:36.88]What's the tallest mountain in the world?
[03:39.44]It's not Everest.
[03:40.64]Well, I mean, in Breath of the Wild, when you get to the tallest mountain, you can see the hut that you're in.
[03:44.54]Oh, but that's just Skyrim.
[03:47.16]But the draw distance wasn't good enough to see my house.
[03:49.56]Alright.
[03:51.14]You ready to play?
[03:52.69]Before I have a mental breakdown 6.0.
[03:56.15]Hey, look at that.
[03:56.69]Oh, wait.
[03:58.81]We need to get the game.
[04:03.25]We do.
[04:03.63]Oh, yeah.
[04:03.99]How do you do that?
[04:06.05]You host.
[04:07.41]I'll join off you.
[04:08.33]Or you, I'll host, and I'll invite you.
[04:10.13]Alright.
[04:14.38]But yeah, we got a little bit of a schedule to adhere to over the next 48 hours, so.
[04:21.09]Yes.
[04:21.87]Time is short.
[04:23.17]I'm making the lobby right now.
[04:24.19]Okay.
[04:29.49]Let's see if I can just join it.
[04:31.27]Lobby pass?
[04:32.13]I guess I need a password.
[04:33.13]I guess you need a password.
[04:34.03]Send it to me on the D-I-S-C-O-R-D.
[04:38.37]Oh, actually, find friend lobbies?
[04:43.11]I am in a lobby now.
[04:44.41]You're in a lobby?
[04:44.91]Let me see if I can find it.
[04:45.49]But it displays the password.
[04:49.28]The password is displayed on... I mean, it's not... Like, I have it hidden from the stream, but if I change the scene, it's on the stream.
[04:57.40]So you just... You just give me the password in Discord, and then I'll join it, and then we'll just join the game.
[05:04.59]What kind of password is that?
[05:07.57]Oh my god, dude.
[05:09.89]What?
[05:10.13]Are you trying to offend all of us?
[05:15.00]Okay, nobody can even see it.
[05:16.36]Alright, I'm in.
[05:18.36]Don't judge my passwords, okay?
[05:20.24]Are we ready?
[05:20.78]The fact that they're secret is what makes them so good.
[05:24.58]Oh, do you get it?
[05:25.08]Is this a character select screen that nobody can see?
[05:27.62]No.
[05:27.80]Can you see the password at the top left?
[05:30.13]No, but you can see the password, but just pick your character and let's get in this game.
[05:36.19]Okay, we ready?
[05:38.47]Glacier Bay is the new content, right?
[05:40.09]Let's hope it doesn't show the password.
[05:41.96]When we get in here.
[05:43.24]That's why I'm still hiding the screen.
[05:45.65]Oh, should I hide the screen?
[05:46.53]Okay, I'm going to hide the screen.
[05:50.67]I don't see a password.
[05:52.29]Okay, I do not see a password.
[05:53.58]I hear a very loud helicopter, though.
[05:55.34]Come on, battlefield moments, dude.
[05:57.50]Get it.
[05:57.72]Battlefield moments.
[06:00.54]We're in.
[06:03.71]It's like a motion blur on.
[06:06.82]Hold on.
[06:07.42]There is a bunch of graphic settings that need to be not on epic.
[06:11.26]Yeah, these often be turned off.
[06:12.32]Wait, I already turned them off.
[06:14.04]Shadows.
[06:15.14]Wow.
[06:16.34]Hold on, man.
[06:16.74]Let's put this on epic and add RTX.
[06:22.50]Whoa.
[06:23.06]What?
[06:24.36]Why does turning the shadows to medium... If you change shadows from epic to medium, it changes your game from like white to blue.
[06:34.14]for me.
[06:35.64]I like that better.
[06:38.45]I actually want it like that.
[06:39.49]I thought this was supposed to be snow.
[06:42.19]Where's the Yeti?
[06:42.81]Hold on, did you pick the right one?
[06:46.33]Is it snowy?
[06:47.09]This is like sand.
[06:49.23]Sand?
[06:50.19]Is this sand?
[06:50.93]My screen is so glary, I can't even see this.
[06:53.99]I think it's definitely snow, but it's because we turned down all the settings off of Epic that now it looks sandy.
[07:02.04]Uh, what is the, what is the, what's it called?
[07:04.76]How do I turn off motion blur?
[07:07.68]Uh, I think that's probably going to be on the post-processing.
[07:10.84]I turned it down to low, and it seems like it's off.
[07:14.96]That just made my game a lot darker.
[07:18.25]I know, that's what I was saying.
[07:19.33]Hold on.
[07:20.51]I want that on.
[07:22.35]I can't see.
[07:22.85]I need to be able to see the Yeti.
[07:25.61]It's already getting dark.
[07:27.17]What?
[07:27.39]I just put it back to high, and it got even darker.
[07:32.76]What?
[07:33.36]Whatever.
[07:35.60]Alright, what do we have for weapons?
[07:38.30]Don't do it.
[07:38.92]You just did it.
[07:39.72]I have to beat you because you're going to do it first.
[07:42.06]We only have like an hour and 20 minutes.
[07:44.97]Because you are going to do it almost guaranteed.
[07:47.01]I was not going to do it.
[07:48.77]I'm standing here.
[07:50.01]What do I hold?
[07:50.53]Let me just pull out my weapon.
[07:52.31]Uh-oh.
[07:52.93]Am I aiming it at his head?
[07:55.17]I guess I'll click the trigger.
[07:56.81]No, dude.
[07:57.31]I'm holding like a can opener right now.
[07:59.66]Yeah, uh-huh.
[08:02.12]Alright.
[08:02.62]I want that... Is Friendly Fighter even on?
[08:07.27]Did you just do a battlefield moment without looking at me?
[08:11.53]You said you wanted to see again.
[08:13.93]So there is your life.
[08:15.45]Alright, we got a knife, we got a rifle with no bullets.
[08:18.04]Alright, let's go find the Yeti.
[08:22.08]Whoa, this actually has a scope on it.
[08:24.25]Is that the Yeti right there?
[08:25.05]Now I know why.
[08:28.55]It's very dark.
[08:29.37]Are we playing DayZ?
[08:30.71]Now I know why I don't stream at 4 o'clock.
[08:34.57]Because my screen is encompassed in light right now.
[08:37.63]I can't even see a fucking thing.
[08:41.31]Well, my screen is not in a glare, and I still can't see anything.
[08:45.05]There's definitely a flashlight.
[08:46.72]Oh, is that Alex Straza?
[08:49.60]How do I get a flashlight out?
[08:52.20]F?
[08:52.98]G?
[08:54.00]F?
[08:54.20]H?
[08:54.32]Night vision cam one hun- ooh.
[08:56.60]What is it?
[08:56.88]How do you do that?
[08:58.16]Uh, in, and then right click.
[09:00.98]Oh, there we go.
[09:01.48]Okay.
[09:03.74]We only have a certain amount of battery power for this, though.
[09:06.41]Yes.
[09:07.19]It's like a horror game.
[09:08.07]We only have so much battery.
[09:09.29]We're playing Outlast right now.
[09:10.41]Outlast Yeti DLC.
[09:11.79]Alright, let's go.
[09:12.93]Let's get to a- That's not a Yeti.
[09:15.07]That's a deer.
[09:17.33]You're freaking me out already.
[09:20.01]We need to make the campfire.
[09:20.69]Is there an animal up ahead?
[09:22.33]I hear something.
[09:24.13]What's our goal?
[09:24.87]Like, we got dropped off by a helicopter.
[09:26.43]Is there not a base camp this time around?
[09:29.25]I don't know.
[09:30.25]Do we have anywhere like the headquarters with all the cameras and stuff, or are we just out here in the wild?
[09:34.57]You have to find eight papers to see the Yeti.
[09:37.13]Oh, no, I get it.
[09:37.91]That was a... That was a slender joke.
[09:41.27]That was a slender man joke.
[09:42.27]Anyone see the movie yet?
[09:46.58]Turn your settings up.
[09:47.52]It looks bad.
[09:47.94]I'm the only one who can respond to that question.
[09:50.85]Guys, no, it really is pitch black.
[09:52.81]We need to build a fire.
[09:55.43]How did we do this last time?
[09:56.48]Survival game?
[09:58.00]Last time, I don't think it was immediately night.
[10:02.02]Was there a map?
[10:03.26]There is a map.
[10:04.14]Okay, there is a research camp, and we're kind of accidentally heading towards it.
[10:07.42]Okay, well, that's good.
[10:08.54]Abandon research camp.
[10:09.90]We're just going to make our way over there.
[10:11.61]Yeah.
[10:12.71]I only have 80% night vision power.
[10:14.87]Well, then there's sprint.
[10:16.41]There's no survival tactics in this.
[10:18.41]I'm stuck on a log.
[10:19.55]Hold on.
[10:23.37]You saw the Blair Witch.
[10:25.65]The movie The Blair Witch?
[10:26.41]That's a pretty good movie, isn't it?
[10:27.57]You know, that's what started all the Slender Man stuff.
[10:32.79]Blair Witch came out.
[10:33.53]What are you doing?
[10:35.55]Something up there?
[10:36.93]I had to adjust my volume.
[10:38.89]I think we're still going the right way.
[10:42.18]Yeah, Slender Man is based off of the Blair Witch.
[10:45.88]Copypasta.com, whatever the place is called, is based off of the Blair Witch project.
[10:54.81]Okay, we need the bear right a little bit.
[10:58.19]What was that?
[11:00.01]What, the bushes?
[11:01.05]I just heard, I heard a noise.
[11:02.63]Okay, see, I think there's like urine on this tree.
[11:05.31]Should we be looking for like dog urine?
[11:07.02]Is a yeti, what is it, what kind of animal is a yeti?
[11:09.98]What side of the tree does moss grow on?
[11:13.44]Is a yeti a bear or is it like a dog bear?
[11:15.78]What is it?
[11:18.20]Um, what kind of animal is that?
[11:20.04]A dog bear?
[11:21.33]Is a yeti a bear?
[11:25.38]You know what I mean?
[11:26.43]Hypothetically speaking?
[11:27.93]Or in the context of this video game?
[11:29.71]Like, just in the context of everything.
[11:31.37]Like, okay, well, I heard the bear.
[11:35.87]Like, a unicorn is a horse.
[11:37.79]Isn't he, like, part ape or monkey?
[11:39.39]I don't know.
[11:40.11]Well, a unicorn is a horse that they put, like, a fucking funny little stick on its head.
[11:44.06]Right?
[11:45.06]A yeti is a bear that they gave him big teeth.
[11:49.14]That's it.
[11:51.67]Oh, he's there.
[11:52.39]He's already here.
[11:53.15]He's running away.
[11:54.43]He's right there.
[11:54.97]He's dead ahead of me.
[11:57.65]He's getting away because he was at the research station.
[12:00.35]He was at the research station.
[12:02.12]He was waiting for us.
[12:03.28]He's the scientist.
[12:04.20]Is this a player?
[12:04.92]I don't think so.
[12:08.32]Would that be hilarious if it was?
[12:10.24]Why is the research center a shitty outdoor bathroom?
[12:14.38]This is just like my timeshare.
[12:19.86]This is a beach bathroom.
[12:22.48]You know what I'm talking about?
[12:23.24]You go to the beach... Wait, I have 39% battery.
[12:26.63]Why is my night vision not working in here?
[12:30.27]Oh, there's a door that has to be opened.
[12:34.81]Did you open it?
[12:36.23]Yeah, I did.
[12:37.09]Are you stuck on the other side?
[12:38.95]I can't... Dude, I can't see.
[12:42.88]There we go.
[12:43.36]Did that help?
[12:44.26]Wow, that light only goes about a foot.
[12:47.40]Oh, man.
[12:48.08]This glare on this screen is unbearable.
[12:51.72]I don't have a curtain on this window.
[12:53.27]Why is there a window here?
[12:54.69]Who put this here?
[12:57.21]What was that?
[12:58.63]Okay.
[13:01.07]Desperate times call for desperate measures here.
[13:03.79]Alright, so what have we got?
[13:04.77]Night vision cam, flare gun.
[13:07.37]Let's load that up.
[13:09.13]Alright, there's traps.
[13:09.95]We have tents now.
[13:11.62]Okay.
[13:12.20]There's signal flares and medicine.
[13:14.22]Medicine.
[13:14.62]Drones.
[13:16.10]Take a map.
[13:16.80]Oops.
[13:18.56]I was trying to shoot another window.
[13:19.78]Is that window openable?
[13:24.48]Hey, come get me, you big, stupid alien.
[13:27.18]It's a callback.
[13:27.86]That's a callback.
[13:28.64]Who knows what that's a callback to?
[13:29.84]That's so loud.
[13:35.09]Uh, E.T.
[13:36.35]No.
[13:39.05]Uh, Jeremy's brother.
[13:43.91]Close the door.
[13:44.43]He's gonna come get you.
[13:45.35]He's not... He doesn't know how to... He's too big to go in there.
[13:47.95]It's not that kind of horror game.
[13:49.87]He's too big to fit in this door.
[13:51.69]So even if he comes over here, he'll have to do... Let's get Alice in Wonderland, guys.
[13:54.75]He'll have to crouch.
[13:56.11]Alright, so what does the F... Wait.
[13:57.60]Oh, there is a flashlight, but it's awful.
[13:59.28]How do you turn it on?
[14:01.48]You can't even tell that it's on, but it's F.
[14:04.80]That's on.
[14:05.62]Your flashlight's on.
[14:07.76]Believe it or not.
[14:09.52]Okay.
[14:10.30]Well, that works.
[14:12.00]See, look, watch.
[14:12.36]Alright, how do we recharge our battery power?
[14:22.83]What if you can't?
[14:23.45]What if that was it and we used it just to get here?
[14:25.25]Well, then we're gonna have to sleep in the bed and wait till morning.
[14:30.90]Can you do that?
[14:31.78]I actually would do that if you could.
[14:33.30]Are we just taking drugs and going to sleep?
[14:35.02]What is this?
[14:36.26]Is that an inhaler?
[14:36.96]Do you have asthma?
[14:39.52]You know what's not asthma?
[14:40.38]It's asthma.
[14:41.08]Oh, there's a cue wheel now.
[14:44.89]It's asthma.
[14:46.13]It's not asthma.
[14:48.03]What is that?
[14:50.55]You know what it is.
[14:52.91]Why do you have... Do you have a drone?
[14:54.11]I do.
[14:56.01]I have a drone.
[14:59.44]I'm not sure how to control it yet.
[15:03.81]How do you do it?
[15:04.65]There's got to be a computer somewhere, right?
[15:06.75]What if the Yeti comes over and he's like, well, I know how to use it.
[15:09.03]Let me see the controller.
[15:09.73]Why does it just sit there?
[15:13.31]Look, I'm new to the hobby, okay?
[15:15.28]I haven't really figured out how to do the loop-the-loops.
[15:19.62]People can, like, you know, if you want to make fun of how we're playing the game and how we're doing this, this is how you would do it in real life.
[15:25.92]You wouldn't be able to figure out how to fly the drone right now if it was this dark.
[15:29.50]You ever been in real pitch black before?
[15:31.96]It's... You don't... You can't do anything.
[15:33.46]All you can do is stand.
[15:36.18]Are you putting that in front of my... You're gonna catch us in the door there.
[15:41.24]There's no, like, battery... It won't let me put it here anyways, so... Alright, well, we have to... ...recharge our batteries.
[15:48.87]World fame.
[15:49.65]It is Minecraft.
[15:50.37]I wanna snipe the Yeti.
[15:55.69]I wanna hit him, like, right between the eyes.
[16:00.23]I like how we just started this game and we're already stuck in the longest night cycle of any video game.
[16:05.56]They must be asleep, right?
[16:06.96]Look at the pretty Aurora Borealis.
[16:12.30]Is it really not asleep?
[16:13.92]I don't think so.
[16:14.54]I think the game just expects... Maybe it'll recharge on its own.
[16:18.99]I'm at zero power right now.
[16:20.55]So I'm at zero.
[16:21.19]Did I do that?
[16:24.03]I have zero power.
[16:26.05]I think I just shot a bullet.
[16:29.48]Now I have traps out.
[16:30.36]Now I really have nothing I can do here.
[16:40.49]You can't even sleep in this... Yeah, yeah, I... I can't see anything, man.
[16:45.54]I don't know where he is.
[16:46.24]Uh, that doesn't sound good.
[16:49.78]Hold on.
[16:50.12]Is the door open?
[16:53.75]Yeah, the door's open.
[16:55.39]Did you just shoot a flare in there again?
[16:58.03]I can't, dude, I can't see anything.
[16:59.81]The door's closed.
[17:01.10]The door's not open.
[17:05.42]Do you still have power?
[17:08.52]What's your power?
[17:12.74]Uh, 27%.
[17:13.28]Alright, the roar came from this direction, I think.
[17:22.72]The moon is going down.
[17:25.24]It's almost time for sunrise.
[17:27.46]See?
[17:28.94]Okay, so we have all these cameras, but how do you use the... Remember there was like a center console that you could like view the cameras from?
[17:38.81]Yeah, I think... There's a deer over there.
[17:41.09]Didn't you like shoot deer to attract the yeti?
[17:43.67]I think you kill deer, you carve them up, and then you put them on the traps.
[17:49.99]While the moon's crashing into the Earth.
[17:52.91]Okay, well I killed a deer.
[17:56.67]Oh no, the moon's crashing.
[17:59.94]Hey, it is a Zelda game.
[18:02.76]Oh my god, I can finally see.
[18:05.62]Oh, there's a body temperature.
[18:06.78]This was a mistake.
[18:07.98]I'm not going in the water.
[18:10.52]I already did.
[18:11.20]It's too late.
[18:12.43]Is that the Aurora Borealis?
[18:15.67]It is.
[18:15.95]I already did that.
[18:19.15]But you already looked at the Aurora Borealis.
[18:21.39]Yeah, and I said, whoa, look at the Aurora Borealis.
[18:27.08]You must have been muted.
[18:29.06]No.
[18:31.90]You're muted.
[18:32.54]Your brain's muted.
[18:34.70]No, I think you were muted is what happened.
[18:36.38]I can see your light from all the way over here.
[18:38.68]I'm just waiting until it's day.
[18:47.36]Your brain's muted.
[18:48.44]Oh, yeah?
[18:54.29]I'm rubber and your glue, whatever you say to me, bounces off me and sticks to you.
[18:57.31]Alright, well, while you're over there, I'm gonna win the game.
[19:05.42]Oh, not gonna get in the water, huh?
[19:08.86]That didn't last long.
[19:10.30]Look, there's some fresh meat here.
[19:11.51]We gotta lure the yeti to it.
[19:13.61]How did you get up there?
[19:15.37]I had to keep swimming around to the banks.
[19:18.67]It was not easy.
[19:19.33]Okay, thank God we can see.
[19:20.95]There has to be a way for us to build a lighter, a lantern, a bigger one or something.
[19:26.22]Alright, there's another deer right there.
[19:28.76]I'm going for the deer.
[19:29.44]Okay, I'm putting a trap by the deer.
[19:32.78]Or attempting to.
[19:34.56]I'm going to carve up this guy.
[19:37.26]It won't let me.
[19:47.14]Oh, okay, you just press E. So I got some meat.
[19:55.88]I don't want to lose you though.
[20:00.46]that's not how it's done but yeah that is how it's done okay so we got the meat then we get the traps then we put the meat on the traps okay so we have to observe with cameras right yeah so I did do you have you do you have cameras I think I have like one or two yeah I got one right here alright so what if we let's try it over here let's put I'm gonna put a camera facing this way okay I think they have to hold it I guess maybe not
[20:28.93]What are you shooting at?
[20:30.35]There was a deer.
[20:31.09]I got some more meat for us.
[20:33.15]Oh, the Yeti's coming already.
[20:34.41]He's over there.
[20:35.35]He's that way.
[20:36.39]I just shot him.
[20:39.27]He's running away now.
[20:41.51]He's fleeing.
[20:42.03]He came over, saw that we were here, and then left.
[20:45.86]I didn't even ask questions.
[20:46.98]I just shot on sight.
[20:50.34]Okay, so let's put some meat here then because he's going to come back.
[20:54.04]Why are you so red?
[20:54.98]I don't know.
[20:56.86]he's in chat alright how do we put the cameras down I think it has to be on a particular type of not ice alright how about up here I think we're on like a sheet of ice right now what's that what's that dude this is like this badger has like rocket feet is it a cat
[21:25.09]Oh, it's a raccoon.
[21:25.85]Okay.
[21:26.47]Let's get the raccoon meat.
[21:31.11]Okay, I got raccoon meat.
[21:36.58]So we have the meat.
[21:39.98]Uh-huh.
[21:40.30]We should look at the map and pick a place.
[21:43.54]Why is it so big?
[21:45.44]Let's, um... Do we want to go, like... We came from south.
[21:51.53]So do we want to go, like, west and north?
[21:53.25]Let's go west, yeah.
[21:53.91]West sounds good to me.
[21:57.84]We have a mini-map at the bottom left, by the way.
[21:59.85]Yeah.
[22:00.61]Let's just go over here.
[22:03.59]Which way is it?
[22:04.31]I don't know.
[22:05.07]This way.
[22:05.99]This way.
[22:06.65]Which way?
[22:07.07]This way.
[22:07.79]You still have your drone.
[22:09.93]You know, we're the elite.
[22:11.43]Sent in by helicopter to hunt this yeti.
[22:14.05]Alright.
[22:15.05]I don't need any fancy things like compasses to help me navigate.
[22:18.84]We're just trying to get our drone video compilation where we drive over the woods and play soft music.
[22:28.31]And then we licensed that footage out for like $400.
[22:30.85]It's going to be a GoPro official.
[22:33.81]Don't you understand?
[22:37.38]See it on my Tube channel.
[22:38.72]Like, Jerma, any ideas for work?
[22:40.44]Yeah?
[22:43.25]Get a drone.
[22:44.42]Get it certified.
[22:45.80]Make sure you follow all the regulations.
[22:48.24]Go fly it over, you know, where legally you can, and take a bunch of cool footage of the woods.
[22:53.10]Put it up on a video royalty-free site for like a thousand dollars.
[22:57.08]And sell it to 25 people.
[22:58.32]There you go.
[22:58.62]There's an entire year of income.
[23:00.62]Just figure out your new job.
[23:03.81]Uh... No, legally.
[23:05.65]Is the trap still there?
[23:08.65]How do you... Aren't you supposed to put meat on the trap?
[23:11.67]Yeah.
[23:12.66]So then, did I just pick it up?
[23:14.38]Did you just ignore that noise?
[23:15.92]You did, yeah.
[23:18.21]How did I?
[23:19.01]I was trying to meat it.
[23:21.03]Okay, I've got the meat.
[23:22.23]So you put meat?
[23:23.63]It's right there.
[23:24.33]Then let's use the meat thermometer and see if it's the right temperature.
[23:28.05]Well, I'm not ready yet.
[23:29.67]Oh, not right, not right.
[23:31.29]It needs to be 170 degrees.
[23:39.30]Can you fly me up?
[23:41.04]Oh, that'd be so funny.
[23:41.86]I don't know how to control it.
[23:43.22]Try to figure out how to control this, and I want you to take me on a fucking video tour of the woods.
[23:51.43]I'm pushing every hotkey to try to figure it out.
[23:57.47]Alt is crouch.
[23:59.09]Okay, there's a tab thing.
[24:00.99]Here it is.
[24:02.29]I am the drone now.
[24:03.50]Okay, wait, can I get on it?
[24:04.64]Go lower to the ground so I can get here.
[24:06.42]Where is he?
[24:07.40]He's here.
[24:07.68]There he is.
[24:09.06]He's right there.
[24:09.44]Uh-oh.
[24:11.20]I got a clear shot.
[24:14.44]Hit him with the drone.
[24:16.90]Hit him with the drone.
[24:17.80]Hit him with the drone.
[24:19.12]I'm dead.
[24:19.48]I'm dying.
[24:21.17]He took the drone control.
[24:23.09]He's the one with the license.
[24:25.65]What?
[24:27.03]Where'd he go?
[24:27.59]Why are we live?
[24:29.37]I'm alive.
[24:29.87]Are you... Where's... Here's my camera.
[24:34.37]Did he actually take the drone?
[24:36.39]He took the drone.
[24:38.15]He stole it.
[24:39.01]You got your drone stolen.
[24:41.35]Yeah, he left the meat.
[24:42.43]Like, this is the bait.
[24:43.27]Yeah, and then, like, a week from now... A week from now, you're gonna go on, like, royaltyfreevideo.com and, like, there's gonna be four or five different clips from, like, Bob Yeti.
[24:54.22]I think I'm gonna shell these for like a thousand dollars each.
[24:56.11]I heard it on the internet.
[24:56.95]That was a good idea.
[24:59.05]Not to, uh, not to ruin it.
[25:02.47]What?
[25:03.05]Oh.
[25:05.01]He barely knocked it really high in the air.
[25:10.41]The drone gets fuzzy whenever the Yeti comes around.
[25:12.71]He's got some kind of RFID device.
[25:15.55]I want to fly around with it.
[25:16.45]Do I have a drone, too?
[25:23.91]Alright, come over here.
[25:25.47]Go to this rock.
[25:27.59]And try to jump on the drone.
[25:29.05]I'm just watching you play with the drone.
[25:31.95]You're Twitch streaming the drone to me right now.
[25:34.79]Look at me.
[25:35.05]I'm in chat.
[25:36.41]See?
[25:36.51]Look at these two people out in the woods just playing on their smartphones right now.
[25:41.89]Can't you just take a second to enjoy nature?
[25:47.80]I'm in the chat.
[25:49.32]I'm in the wrong chat.
[25:50.10]I've got to be in your chat.
[25:54.99]I'm standing next to you while you do a stream.
[25:57.27]By the way, this is what IRL streams are.
[25:59.15]Have you ever watched an IRL stream?
[26:01.38]There's, like, one guy.
[26:03.36]Yeah, people with backpacks.
[26:04.46]One guy has the stream going, and the other, like, four people that are also there during the stream have their phones up watching the stream.
[26:12.00]Yeah, they're watching chat to see what everyone says about them.
[26:14.39]Yeah.
[26:14.57]That's what we're doing.
[26:15.89]This is an IRL stream.
[26:21.36]How far out can I go?
[26:22.58]Let's see.
[26:23.56]Go find him.
[26:24.70]It's not that hard.
[26:25.95]I can go 54 kilometers, kilometers per hour.
[26:31.31]Find him, it's not that hard.
[26:33.05]Okay.
[26:34.37]I'll keep that mantra in my mind.
[26:36.34]You said it gets fuzzy.
[26:37.20]I don't know.
[26:39.22]Did you just get hurt?
[26:39.96]It gets fuzzy when you get close to him.
[26:41.46]Oh, so is that another slender reference?
[26:43.80]No, so if it gets fuzzy... Look, this can go way faster than we can move, right?
[26:48.09]So just circle us.
[26:48.95]Uh-huh.
[26:51.03]Don't have to crash it.
[26:52.21]Okay, watch out for the deer.
[26:55.93]Wow, so scenic.
[26:56.73]Am I making the trailer for this game right now?
[26:59.74]No, you've got to sell this.
[27:00.66]That's going to be a clip in the trailer.
[27:02.42]You've got to sell this on myvideopresentation.org.
[27:10.51]I'm going to sell it on Fiverr.
[27:11.97]This is 83%.
[27:12.57]That's a lot.
[27:16.61]I think we're somewhere over here.
[27:20.87]I think I'm cool just being in the chest.
[27:21.81]It's getting nighttime.
[27:22.33]We're wasting our daylight.
[27:23.71]We're squandering our light hours by flying in the drone.
[27:26.59]Well, we had an opportunity and he just came and backhanded you and then bumped into me.
[27:33.08]I've lost us.
[27:35.04]Why does it make you want to buy a drone?
[27:36.22]I mean, this is... By its very just core design, a drone is kind of cool.
[27:42.20]Don't you think?
[27:44.08]Oh, it's a mini-map.
[27:45.87]Yeah.
[27:46.59]Because you're doing something you can't do in real life.
[27:48.57]Like, you're making something fly.
[27:59.11]Yeti's right there?
[28:01.77]Where?
[28:05.15]I really wish you could spy on him eating or something.
[28:10.68]How do you turn this off?
[28:13.64]Now it's gonna be dark again for like 20 minutes.
[28:18.00]Gonna pick up my toy drone?
[28:20.20]No, you know what?
[28:20.70]Just keep... Okay, I think what we're supposed to do... Offline.
[28:26.99]What offline?
[28:27.79]Comcast.
[28:30.31]Wait, you're offline?
[28:31.45]No, no, no.
[28:32.01]I was making a dumb joke.
[28:32.95]Alright, wait.
[28:33.37]I have a camera here.
[28:34.11]Yeah, I think what we're supposed to do is get traps set up during the day and then play Five Nights at Freddy's at night.
[28:42.18]Where we switch between our cameras to try to find out where he is.
[28:45.72]Yeah, because the difference here was there's no computer.
[28:48.42]We have an iPad.
[28:51.70]You can do it from anywhere.
[28:57.33]Are you controlling this?
[28:58.55]Yeah.
[28:58.77]I'm just zoomed in.
[29:04.18]What research is, huh?
[29:10.39]I'm gonna laugh if he just runs over here and just swats you like a fly.
[29:21.09]Alright, where is he?
[29:23.39]Get back, get back there, back, back up.
[29:27.45]Put your canteen down.
[29:30.59]Try and find him.
[29:32.01]It's important.
[29:34.23]We have to look for... What can my guy possibly be doing right now?
[29:44.75]I have 8% battery.
[29:48.39]The Yeti's watching the stream over my shoulder.
[29:51.33]What happened to my mic?
[29:52.77]What's wrong with my mic?
[29:57.14]I think he may be here.
[30:01.31]We want to make sure we get this shot for the camera, okay?
[30:03.43]This one's going in the foot of the highlight reel.
[30:16.67]He didn't know he was in my room.
[30:20.48]He's actually over your shoulder the whole time.
[30:24.80]Do I have night vision again?
[30:25.92]No.
[30:28.44]We're stuck here.
[30:30.46]Yep.
[30:39.44]It's actually easier for me to see.
[30:41.52]Can you die in this game?
[30:43.56]Or do you just get knocked around until you win?
[30:46.80]See, right now, somebody clipped that, and I'm watching the clip going like, holy shit, oh, get out, attacks, come here.
[30:52.22]Look at how funny this is.
[30:53.56]I just got killed by the Yeti?
[30:55.94]This is where I died.
[30:56.64]Look, wait, wait, wait, it's coming up here in a minute.
[31:04.38]Stop playing the game on your phone.
[31:06.55]I want to watch, too.
[31:08.05]Yeah, you want to watch the clip?
[31:10.58]Uh-huh.
[31:14.78]Can you put my own camera down?
[31:21.20]Why are we playing the game like this?
[31:22.64]Okay, turn left.
[31:25.70]Turn left.
[31:26.34]More.
[31:27.06]Oh.
[31:28.32]Oh, we have two cameras now.
[31:31.02]This makes sense because this is my stream and then that's your stream.
[31:34.48]Mm-hmm.
[31:40.91]Alright.
[31:41.73]Interact.
[31:43.11]I'm reading the tutorial.
[31:45.73]You can use a fire or room to stay warm.
[31:48.69]So apparently we can make a fire.
[31:52.79]Trap Bigfoot.
[31:53.63]So Bigfoot does not notice it.
[31:56.44]Oh, mask the trap.
[31:58.88]Bigfoot reacts to bait and dead animals.
[32:02.32]Do I have any more cameras I can set up?
[32:03.82]There's loot around the map.
[32:10.15]There's loot around the map!
[32:12.13]Man, so apparently there's a reason to explore.
[32:14.07]Because you'll get, I guess, resupplies.
[32:16.85]Oh my god, this... I... I... I'm gonna have to, like, stay right behind you.
[32:20.81]Because I can't see.
[32:23.75]We need night vision batteries.
[32:25.55]Uh, I think we may be freezing to death.
[32:28.16]What's my body temperature?
[32:28.94]30?
[32:28.96]Oh.
[32:31.20]I'm at 29.7 Celsius, and I'm noticing some effects.
[32:35.44]Yep.
[32:36.36]I am too.
[32:37.08]Well, we might as well just turn on our fucking Twitch cameras.
[32:56.20]I lasted longer!
[32:57.10]I win the IRL challenge!
[33:05.20]Do you hear that scream?
[33:06.98]No.
[33:08.00]Scream?
[33:10.43]It's one of us dying over and over again.
[33:12.73]Oh, I heard you die.
[33:13.75]Am I wearing shorts?
[33:18.07]No, those are not my knees.
[33:19.15]I thought those were my knees.
[33:22.08]So why am I still alive?
[33:23.18]Does that just mean that my body is... I don't know.
[33:24.78]I think it may be the sound of you dying.
[33:27.94]Am I... Well, I died.
[33:32.79]You've added to the cacophony for a moment, and then it stopped.
[33:38.01]Take a look at what we're getting right there.
[33:41.47]Score?
[33:42.45]Maybe another time.
[33:47.94]Hold on.
[33:48.48]And there's the Yetis royalty free.
[33:50.10]That's a bad video, though, man.
[33:56.54]How are we doing?
[33:58.48]Gotta make sure it didn't like, flash the menu screen.
[34:01.42]Yeah, I'm loading right now.
[34:03.68]I turned my screen off.
[34:06.14]Yeah, we have to do it again.
[34:07.70]Uh-oh.
[34:09.48]Did you just show the lobby's password?
[34:12.77]No, there's no lobby password, but it booted me to the main menu.
[34:15.77]Yeah.
[34:16.59]No, we lost.
[34:17.09]Yeah, just start over.
[34:20.13]Do it again, I guess.
[34:23.15]Alright, so campfire and houses are warm.
[34:25.59]You both did 10 damage.
[34:29.27]How did I do 10 damage?
[34:30.09]I shot him right in the nectar.
[34:32.59]You know what I mean?
[34:33.07]Okay, give me one sec.
[34:36.02]Right in the spot where I got him in the nectar.
[34:39.00]That's where the nectar comes out.
[34:54.95]Yeti Nectar.
[34:57.21]Oh, man.
[34:59.16]Stop lying.
[35:00.00]What are you talking about?
[35:00.54]You saw it.
[35:00.94]That's not the password.
[35:06.60]Alright.
[35:07.08]Same password.
[35:07.68]You're doing the same password, but that's not secure.
[35:10.14]It's the same one.
[35:12.96]I wrote it down.
[35:13.60]That's the one I've used since I was two years old.
[35:15.44]Okay.
[35:15.92]Yeti Nectar.
[35:16.78]I use it for everything.
[35:18.50]Like my AltaVista account.
[35:20.98]That's old.
[35:23.07]Alright, so let's do it again.
[35:25.85]This time, hopefully we don't get immediate nighttime.
[35:37.07]Are you ready?
[35:38.45]I am.
[35:39.14]Ready up, man.
[35:41.82]Alright, let's do it.
[35:49.30]Looks like the Yeti was the friends we made.
[35:53.89]Put me back in.
[35:54.39]Alright, let's go.
[35:56.83]We have only a certain amount of opportunity.
[35:59.39]We do.
[35:59.95]It's daylight right now.
[36:01.25]We have to go right now.
[36:02.18]Bingo.
[36:02.98]Research camp.
[36:03.56]Let's go.
[36:03.82]Make sure you have your guns at the ready.
[36:06.94]And make sure they're loaded.
[36:14.97]Why do I feel like I got this rifle out of the... ...worst possible, like, skin box?
[36:20.27]You know, this isn't common.
[36:24.37]Please give me some cool decals.
[36:25.43]That's because the scope doesn't have a texture.
[36:27.25]It's just silver.
[36:29.63]The barrel has no texture either.
[36:33.77]Get that deer!
[36:34.35]Can we let that run away?
[36:35.99]We have more priorities.
[36:37.09]Do we have guns at the ready?
[36:38.67]We have guns at the ready.
[36:39.45]You got a hold of the Yeti, man.
[36:42.12]How do you think you're gonna get him?
[36:43.32]Oh, don't worry.
[36:43.96]Just got it.
[36:44.36]I took not enough time to process that image and got the Yeti.
[36:50.60]I mean the deer.
[36:54.35]Okay, keep going.
[36:56.57]Research facility.
[36:57.25]We need to find loot, too, man.
[36:59.85]Yeah, so we gotta, you know, find hot spots around the map.
[37:04.71]We're looking for chests, or... Probably just, like, little outposts, little cabins in the woods, you know?
[37:11.48]Cool.
[37:13.50]That's kind of cool, man.
[37:14.38]I wonder if there'll be monsters in there.
[37:17.42]I wonder if there's more than the Yeti.
[37:21.72]Hey, if the developer's watching the stream right now, make a Loch Ness Monster version where you're in scuba gear and you go down looking for them.
[37:31.12]That would just be Subnautica.
[37:33.15]No, but Subnautica doesn't have the... Yeah, it does.
[37:35.19]Never mind.
[37:35.87]Somebody already made that game.
[37:38.65]Alright, here we go.
[37:40.23]Sun's going down.
[37:42.80]Nothing in here.
[37:44.72]We got here as fast as we could.
[37:46.14]Let the record show.
[37:48.10]Okay, door.
[37:49.88]We got flares.
[37:52.60]Uh, baby medicine, uh, diamond tap cups.
[37:54.82]Don't need those right now.
[37:56.38]I'll take... I'll take a couple cameras.
[37:58.25]I'll take three cameras.
[37:59.01]You take three cameras.
[38:04.81]Taking a couple of traps.
[38:08.61]Okay.
[38:11.23]How am I liking your game so far?
[38:14.54]It's pretty cool, man.
[38:16.92]Pretty cool, dude.
[38:21.71]Alright, so let's... Developer in the chat.
[38:24.33]Dev in chat right now.
[38:28.59]Cool.
[38:28.87]Got the drone.
[38:30.19]Okay, we got the drone.
[38:31.31]Now what do we do?
[38:34.63]At night?
[38:35.51]Well, we didn't use any night vision to get here.
[38:38.01]That's true.
[38:38.71]Right.
[38:39.44]So let's pick a place in the map.
[38:40.66]There's also tents here.
[38:41.50]We have to figure out how to make a fire.
[38:43.54]Yeah, we need a tent.
[38:44.12]So we don't freeze to death.
[38:45.24]So look, where's the tent?
[38:47.02]There's a tent right here.
[38:48.02]Alright, get it.
[38:49.61]I already have one.
[38:50.41]Alright.
[38:50.75]Now let's... Can you, like, select it?
[38:52.55]What do you mean, that one?
[38:53.45]Oh.
[38:53.95]Okay.
[38:55.16]So, is there... Can you... Can we select it?
[38:57.68]It's not on my number pad here.
[38:59.80]Camera, flare gun, rifle, Q. Well, that's something I didn't know existed.
[39:04.30]Thank you for showing that to me.
[39:05.34]Alright, we got... Tent.
[39:07.20]I'm the developer.
[39:08.66]Alright, tent.
[39:09.47]I got a tent in my hand, I think.
[39:11.61]Uh-huh.
[39:12.27]Okay.
[39:13.73]Are you sure this is not Claymore Mine?
[39:15.83]I feel like it would put this down and somebody could... Alright.
[39:19.14]Just strip the C4.
[39:21.19]So let's go.
[39:21.71]Okay, we know how to do that now.
[39:23.53]Get your night vision ready.
[39:25.75]Guns at the ready.
[39:26.61]There's a way... Hold on, hold on.
[39:29.87]How do you make a fire?
[39:31.07]Do you have to find fires?
[39:33.25]Or do you get like... There's an axe up here is why I'm confused.
[39:35.90]I don't know.
[39:37.50]Maybe you have to... This is sticks.
[39:38.92]We need to pick up... We haven't picked up any sticks.
[39:40.52]I have zero sticks in my inventory.
[39:42.76]Did you do that?
[39:44.59]Find fire.
[39:45.63]It's just like on the ground.
[39:47.13]Pick it up.
[39:47.47]Put it in your backpack.
[39:48.19]It could be.
[39:48.45]I don't know.
[39:49.03]Alright, you do it.
[39:49.47]Alright, we went west last time.
[39:52.09]Yeah, so let's go from here.
[39:52.83]We're gonna go east this time.
[39:53.83]Yeah.
[39:54.27]So where are you?
[39:54.87]Alright, I'm following you.
[39:57.37]Make big pickups.
[39:58.07]Sticks on the ground.
[40:02.85]Or maybe not.
[40:07.65]Your guess is as good as mine.
[40:09.21]You can't even figure out how to make fire.
[40:15.78]Oh, please, get over that.
[40:21.66]Okay.
[40:22.84]So, last time, the Yeti pretty much came as soon as we put meat down on the ground.
[40:26.89]Fun fact for you, uh, the Nintendo Wii U was originally called the Nintendo Yeti.
[40:33.31]Huh?
[40:34.51]They went back on it because, uh, it was, like, a project name.
[40:39.00]You know, like, the Nintendo Revolution was the Wii, the Nintendo Yeti was the Wii U.
[40:43.76]Oh, yeah.
[40:44.70]It's common knowledge.
[40:46.08]I learned that from Reggie.
[40:48.40]I learned that from Reddit, too.
[40:52.80]Watch out for the bugs.
[40:54.02]These are the rocket raccoons.
[40:58.82]Alright, that was just good.
[41:07.85]You better take that meat, or I'm going to be upset.
[41:09.93]I am!
[41:10.71]I'm taking it.
[41:11.89]You're upset with me.
[41:14.94]We have life over here.
[41:16.08]People.
[41:17.52]Like three or four people NPCs.
[41:20.98]I wish.
[41:21.28]Just kidding.
[41:21.92]Sorry, I just ruined the game for you.
[41:27.26]Alright.
[41:28.36]Have you found a stick yet?
[41:29.36]How do we not find a stick?
[41:30.88]They're everywhere.
[41:31.80]I don't know how to make fire.
[41:33.94]They're everywhere.
[41:36.64]Stick.
[41:36.98]I got one.
[41:37.48]You got one?
[41:37.96]Alright.
[41:38.22]How many sticks does it take to make a fire?
[41:39.96]Like 400, right?
[41:43.00]Where did you go?
[41:43.48]There you are.
[41:46.39]What am I doing right now?
[41:48.67]What are you doing right now?
[41:51.93]Holding the stick in your hand.
[41:53.91]Like... You're treating it like a walking stick, but it's way too small.
[41:59.81]Okay, so not enough to make a campfire.
[42:02.60]Hold on, where is he?
[42:04.66]Where is he?
[42:10.36]How does he know that we're here already?
[42:12.20]He can probably smell the night vision.
[42:14.70]That's my guess.
[42:16.76]He does hate technology, we know.
[42:18.36]Alright, we're good.
[42:21.94]Just keep going.
[42:22.30]Alright, we need to set up, like, something here.
[42:27.45]We just need more sticks.
[42:30.29]We need a campfire.
[42:31.27]We need a place to sleep.
[42:32.78]Should we just go to sleep?
[42:35.36]In real life?
[42:36.56]No, I mean... Look, we can set up cameras.
[42:40.25]Put the sleeping bags down and just go to bed.
[42:42.13]That's how people do it.
[42:43.20]That's how... Alright, got more sticks.
[42:46.42]That's how Bear Grylls did it.
[42:47.44]Alright, I'm putting a camera right here.
[42:49.94]Alright, got a couple more sticks.
[42:56.70]Alright, how much does it take to make a fire?
[42:58.68]Sticks, three.
[43:03.35]That's a pretty good camera right there.
[43:06.91]Should I put a tent down then?
[43:09.96]I mean, you could.
[43:10.66]Do we want to lure Bigfoot, though, to the tent?
[43:14.42]You know what I mean?
[43:15.10]Maybe.
[43:15.48]That's going to be a problem, right?
[43:17.67]Orcs Must Die here.
[43:18.55]I'm putting a trap here.
[43:21.37]Just lie down and surround the place with traps.
[43:27.23]Bear Grylls eats hummus when the camera's off.
[43:31.34]How do you cover up the trap after you put it down?
[43:33.60]Sticks, probably.
[43:35.44]Oh, yeah.
[43:37.60]Does that work?
[43:41.56]There's the meat.
[43:43.14]And... Stick.
[43:46.93]Do you have a stick or do I have a stick?
[43:48.45]I got a stick here.
[43:49.11]I got three sticks.
[43:52.09]I don't think it's the stick.
[43:53.73]It's not the stick.
[43:55.31]Wouldn't it be like hit E on it to bury it in the... Maybe that picks it up.
[44:02.60]Well, I'm clicking stick on it and nothing's happening.
[44:04.66]Maybe not.
[44:04.90]Maybe just leave it there.
[44:06.80]But it does say you have to hide the trap.
[44:09.04]Hold E. Hold E on it?
[44:11.55]I did.
[44:12.07]It's covered up.
[44:12.73]Ah, okay.
[44:13.13]Now, let's set up the cameras.
[44:15.34]I have one camera set.
[44:16.84]I'm putting this one over here.
[44:17.58]We probably only need one.
[44:19.38]Let's get two, just in case.
[44:20.46]You know, you never know.
[44:22.62]Come on.
[44:23.00]You never know when you need that other angle, man.
[44:27.04]Okay.
[44:27.98]Now, let's get in a... Maybe we should make it to the right place.
[44:31.42]Yep.
[44:32.50]Okay.
[44:33.54]Good.
[44:37.09]Now, let's set up a tent here.
[44:39.03]Can we both go in the same tent?
[44:47.24]Uh, I don't know.
[44:48.30]Let's see.
[44:48.60]Do you really want to do that?
[44:50.30]Let me put this again.
[44:50.96]Is that what you really want?
[44:51.56]We're putting the tent right here.
[44:52.42]Kind of away from the meat.
[44:56.74]Tent.
[44:58.18]Tent one.
[44:59.32]And here it goes.
[45:03.63]So that's a big tent.
[45:04.75]Yeah.
[45:05.07]Can we both go in there?
[45:08.21]Wait, why does it say fire?
[45:09.21]Why is there a fire?
[45:09.91]It says fire on the tent.
[45:12.23]Probably because it's like a home thing.
[45:13.79]Why is it already full of snow?
[45:17.88]Alright, okay.
[45:18.74]Watch out.
[45:19.18]I'm in.
[45:19.84]How do you approach?
[45:21.56]I'll alt for some reason.
[45:22.90]Alright, here we go.
[45:28.74]How did he go to sleep?
[45:33.28]Guys, there are noises out here.
[45:36.92]Someone's walking around outside the tent.
[45:39.22]Get in the tent.
[45:39.96]Get the camera.
[45:41.58]Get into your camera.
[45:44.34]There we go.
[45:45.92]See?
[45:46.34]We're fine.
[45:56.29]I got a view of the tent, and I got a view of the meat.
[46:01.03]So we just sit here, we're warm in there, everything's fine.
[46:03.17]Now we just have to wait for him to come eat his dinner, and then we're gonna... He's gonna get trapped?
[46:25.25]Okay, got another camera outside to make sure we're okay.
[46:27.69]Good.
[46:28.41]You know?
[46:29.41]Got a secondary cam outside.
[46:31.41]So now we just have to wait for him.
[46:34.35]We're still losing heat.
[46:37.91]Um... I don't know how... What do you mean, I don't know how?
[46:43.16]It's a piece of cloth.
[46:46.02]It's a neon green tent cloth that we've... With four windows, by the way.
[46:52.24]Zip it up!
[46:54.25]You need a fire.
[46:55.27]So... You need a fire inside the tent?
[47:00.73]Maybe.
[47:01.11]Is there a way to hold E on the tent to try to build a fire?
[47:03.82]Because it has the little fireplace on it.
[47:05.16]Give it a look.
[47:10.64]I got a good angle.
[47:12.22]I can see that he's not anywhere.
[47:13.62]You're safe.
[47:15.36]Item limit.
[47:16.14]Oh, it was trying to pick up the tent.
[47:19.06]Maybe right next to it?
[47:20.35]I don't know.
[47:27.94]I don't see him anywhere.
[47:28.89]The sound of my own footsteps is freaking me out.
[47:34.19]It's great that he wouldn't leave us alone for the first, you know, 40 minutes.
[47:38.01]And then we actually, like, put a trap up here.
[47:39.93]And now he won't come over here.
[47:41.95]Yeah.
[47:43.47]Pretty standard.
[47:44.30]Yeah.
[47:46.48]Do not build fires in tents.
[47:49.50]In real life?
[47:51.70]Oh, you mean in real life.
[47:52.50]Okay.
[47:52.66]I didn't know if you meant video games.
[48:03.65]Okay, okay, hold on.
[48:04.55]I don't know where... He might be coming for the meat.
[48:11.63]Do you have a gun ready?
[48:15.92]Where is he?
[48:16.42]I don't know.
[48:16.70]I don't see him.
[48:17.96]Do I have a gun ready?
[48:19.56]Yeah, I got a gun, but I can't see.
[48:20.88]I can't see anything.
[48:24.26]I think I hear him.
[48:24.76]No.
[48:29.86]It was just me, wasn't it?
[48:31.28]I think it was you.
[48:34.30]I'm out here, you know?
[48:37.69]Just in case.
[48:39.57]We're supposed to hide, though.
[48:41.21]Yeah, in the tent.
[48:45.63]And then when he gets stuck, you come out and start getting him.
[48:51.63]Okay, I'm in the tent.
[48:53.27]Okay, good.
[48:53.90]Flashlight off.
[48:55.08]Actually, there's just a light in the tent, I think.
[48:57.66]Is my flashlight on?
[48:59.86]Yours... Someone's light is on.
[49:02.64]There's a light in here.
[49:07.48]Oh, yeah, yeah, it's mine.
[49:09.10]No, it's not.
[49:11.10]No, that didn't matter.
[49:13.40]I think there's just a light inside of this.
[49:19.89]So, uh... Where is he?
[49:23.69]He came all the way out here.
[49:30.77]I don't think he's here.
[49:33.55]He probably... Yeti!
[49:38.42]No, call his phone.
[49:40.45]Oh.
[49:42.81]I think he changed his number.
[49:45.95]That's what he told me anyway.
[49:48.31]I think he's supposed to be around here.
[49:50.69]I mean, it is the name of the game.
[50:01.64]Are you dead?
[50:02.02]No.
[50:02.26]Are you?
[50:04.30]What's your HP?
[50:09.85]How cold are you right now?
[50:14.89]33 degrees, 0.2 Celsius.
[50:17.25]I just hear one single gunshot.
[50:20.13]And I see the flare of the tent.
[50:23.78]Stop wasting your bullets.
[50:24.56]You're scaring him away.
[50:26.96]You've been fishing before.
[50:29.22]I'm letting him know that we're here.
[50:30.54]No, stop.
[50:31.38]You're scaring the fish away.
[50:33.74]We're fishing right now.
[50:34.76]Sometimes it takes like four hours sitting there reading a book.
[50:38.50]Alright, I'll be more quiet.
[50:49.14]Where is this fucking dickhead?
[50:57.80]Fishing for Bigfoot.
[51:00.24]Hey, do- hey, you got any jerky?
[51:01.78]I heard he loves jerky.
[51:04.40]Hey, let's mess with him when he gets over here.
[51:06.04]Get him in the trap, and then I'm gonna hit him in the face with a fish!
[51:12.18]I think I play with all the toys I have.
[51:19.55]You play with all the toys?
[51:21.95]Why don't you drive the flying car?
[51:24.73]Drive the flying RC car.
[51:29.83]I did that at night, so I could see.
[51:32.49]Yeah, but maybe take a look around.
[51:34.05]You can see better than I can.
[51:36.03]It's daytime.

[51:41.47]We can go now.
[51:42.25]Oh, we can go now?
[51:44.37]Yeah.
[51:45.27]It's very bright outside.
[51:46.31]Oh.
[51:46.37]Did you look at that?
[51:48.89]Okay.
[51:49.31]Did you happen to look in the tent before you left?
[51:51.89]I did not.
[51:52.35]What's in the tent?
[51:55.27]What did you do?
[51:59.68]You didn't see that giant pile of blood?
[52:02.13]no I didn't oh I think it just got done fading away actually health bar alright let's keep going with you we should take the trap he's not gonna you know leave the well you gotta leave trap I think you're supposed to leave traps like scattered around and then spread the cameras out and then figure out which sector reason well I just picked it all up
[52:29.05]He was in our sector.
[52:30.23]Alright, let's go to the top left.
[52:33.37]Follow me.
[52:35.62]Let's go on top of this mountain.
[52:39.46]Pick up sticks along the way.
[52:41.12]We gotta shoot any wild animal along the way, because he goes for animal carcasses.
[52:52.50]Okay, that's good.
[52:53.80]Good.
[52:54.82]Good.
[52:54.92]You're picking up sticks.
[52:55.92]I'm picking up as many as I can, man.
[52:57.88]What do they do?
[52:58.50]I don't know.
[52:59.46]I assume start a fire somehow.
[53:01.22]Fire?
[53:01.64]Traps?
[53:05.26]Alright, let's keep going.
[53:06.02]I wonder if there's more than one Yeti.
[53:13.65]What's up with the gun?
[53:16.95]I don't know.
[53:18.67]It's just kind of there, isn't it?
[53:23.31]Where are you?
[53:23.87]I just lost you.
[53:25.59]Just keep moving.
[53:27.01]I want to go to this big boulder over here.
[53:28.65]There's a stream.
[53:33.41]Hey, live stream right now?
[53:34.45]I jumped in the water and a blood went all over my face.
[53:36.69]Turn this off.
[53:51.52]Why am I way... Look.
[53:55.16]Do you have to look down to me?
[53:56.12]I mean, it's just the surface that we're both on.
[53:59.18]Alright, let's keep going.
[54:07.81]Where are we headed right now?
[54:08.87]We're heading to the big rock.
[54:10.15]What do you mean he's there?
[54:12.05]I heard a roar.
[54:12.77]Is the big rock his house or something?
[54:23.73]I swear I heard a roar this way.
[54:27.06]Are you taking us off course?
[54:32.48]I can make a campfire.
[54:36.12]What are you doing?
[54:37.60]I just... I misclicked.
[54:39.43]I can make a campfire.
[54:41.23]That's great.
[54:41.75]We're campfiring on the mountain.
[54:44.31]Okay.
[54:45.41]See that mountain?
[54:46.29]You can campfire there.
[54:48.65]You can campfire anywhere.
[54:51.07]Don't you dare bring up that old shit.
[54:55.37]We have been talking about Skyrim at least the whole stream.
[54:59.28]I've never... I've not said the word Skyrim one time.
[55:02.20]Did you have me muted?
[55:05.48]You just did.
[55:07.90]Alright, is this alright?
[55:08.73]This looks cool.
[55:10.29]Can we get on the mountain?
[55:14.31]Let's wrap around, see if there's a way to get on top.
[55:17.53]You just said it, yeah.
[55:18.55]I know I did.
[55:20.16]I was referencing the fact that I didn't say it previously.
[55:24.68]Alright, getting there.

[55:34.42]Like this is a speed run technique.
[55:36.30]Alright, we can get up there.
[55:38.89]I want the camp.
[55:39.43]We gotta get the campfire up here.
[55:44.61]Maybe the other way.
[55:48.05]That didn't feel good.
[55:54.21]What, is he gonna come up here and get us?
[55:57.57]He has to do this too.
[55:59.47]Also to give us a good view.
[56:03.83]No way you can get up that side.
[56:04.91]It's even better this way.
[56:06.09]Yeah.
[56:10.51]Oh no.
[56:16.32]Alright, well, right here is fine.
[56:17.84]Oh fuck, I just got hurt.

[58:37.48]What's the backup game?
[58:38.92]The backup game?
[58:40.88]I'm ready for the backup game.
[58:42.64]There is no backup game.
[58:44.68]Are you sure?
[58:47.80]Is there a backup game?
[58:48.90]You tell me.
[58:53.59]This is the backup game.
[58:55.21]This is the backup to the backup game.
[58:56.81]This is the backup game.
[58:58.67]There's a backup game.
[59:02.83]Yeah, the backup game is leaving to go to Las Vegas.
[59:10.17]No, there's definitely a backup game.
[59:11.67]Alright, well, while you do the backup, while you figure that out... I got to mute for a second, too.
[59:17.79]Okay.
[59:19.79]Fortnite?
[59:20.56]No, we're not doing Fortnite.
[59:24.40]Let me see.
[59:24.92]I can't.
[59:25.22]And I would turn my facecam on, but I don't have any clothes on.
[59:29.00]I would turn.
[59:29.40]I can't even turn my facecam on.
[59:34.01]God damn it.
[59:40.87]Liar.
[59:42.53]That's.
[59:42.87]No, it's not.
[59:45.03]Put on clothes.
[59:52.82]I can't, so you want me to prove to you that I'm not wearing clothes, which will ban, I will get like suspended from Twitch if I'm just sitting here fucking naked.
[60:04.02]Alright, let me just, let's go like this to see if you got something on the screen.
[60:22.92]Is the Talos with you?
[60:24.54]No, he's over there.
[60:29.92]Now I'm just playing by myself.
[60:33.46]Wait!
[60:33.90]Hold on!
[60:34.44]Wait for me!
[60:37.80]Nothing changed except the fact that now it's just me.
[60:39.88]I want to see if I can kill him myself.
[60:52.23]That actually hit.
[60:54.49]That hit too.
[61:03.53]What if that thing falls down?
[61:06.61]No, it's not going to work.
[61:15.39]I'm hitting the skybox.
[61:16.75]Oh, okay.
[61:17.87]Well, that would make sense now, wouldn't it?
[61:23.08]Yellow.
[61:23.62]Hey.
[61:24.94]I fixed my thing.
[61:25.88]You fixed your thing.
[61:26.44]Alright.
[61:27.00]So what's the plan for the next, like, 35 minutes?
[61:33.38]The plan for the next 35 minutes.
[61:37.88]By the way, got him.
[61:41.45]Got him.
[61:41.75]I'm chasing him.
[61:42.77]I'm just doing single player, and I'm going to kill the Yeti.
[61:45.67]I doubt that very much.
[61:49.17]You're not going to kill the Yeti.
[61:50.65]I'm tracking him right now.
[61:52.83]You're not going to catch me.
[61:56.67]Oh yeah?
[61:57.11]Go to www.twitch.tv.com right now.
[62:02.14]Okay.
[62:04.16]He's got like a thousand health.
[62:07.88]Everyone chat to go to your stream.
[62:09.34]They're already there.
[62:12.24]Okay, if I land this shot... Never mind.
[62:15.43]Hold on.
[62:16.43]Stream's floating.
[62:23.46]Hold on, wait.
[62:23.96]Wait for it to load.
[62:25.70]It already did, and you missed.
[62:27.32]I saw you miss.
[62:28.65]But that was... I told you, never mind.
[62:30.35]I'm gonna kill him with the flare.
[62:38.99]So, what are we doing?
[62:40.25]Like, ask us anything with the Jerma and Etalyx?
[62:45.39]Uh, we could do... Um...
[62:51.10]Mute your stream for a second.
[62:52.08]Or mute me on your stream for a second.
[62:53.12]Hold on.
[62:53.34]Hold on.
[62:54.92]He's important.
[62:55.98]God damn it.
[62:57.58]Hold on.
[63:00.16]I tried.
[63:01.88]Alright.
[63:02.18]I can mute you?
[63:03.74]Yeah.
[63:04.02]Well, mute the desktop stream.
[63:06.74]Okay.
[63:07.00]Yeah.
[63:07.40]It's muted.
[63:08.08]What's up?
[63:08.98]What are you looking for here?
[63:22.98]Alright, we got the plan here.
[63:25.06]This is what we're gonna do for the next, like, 30 minutes.
[63:27.02]We're gonna play Overcooked 2.
[63:29.14]Remember that fun game that we played a few days ago?
[63:31.40]Or a week or two ago?
[63:33.96]It was a few weeks ago.
[63:35.49]But it fits the spot.
[63:38.73]It does fit the spot for us needing to leave.
[63:41.57]No.
[63:42.13]Wait, everyone's saying boo.
[63:43.51]Everyone's screaming boo.
[63:48.98]We'll make a better suggestion then.
[63:50.66]He's not here.
[63:51.32]He's not here, guys.
[63:53.29]Stop calling his name.
[63:54.15]He's not here.
[63:57.95]I see what you did there.
[63:58.97]Alright.
[63:59.73]Then how about, like, nobody wants to see it, apparently.
[64:04.56]Alright.
[64:05.16]Well, what about... Goddamn.

[64:21.46]Why is this telling me come back?
[64:29.35]I'm stuck in an infinite loop here.
[64:32.67]You're probably out of bounds.

[64:35.85]Whatever.
[64:36.15]Alright.
[64:36.87]So, first game that you see on Steam.

[64:42.30]What's the first game on Steam that you see?
[64:46.10]The first new game on Steam.
[64:49.76]I don't like it.

[65:45.54]The Family Feud game?
[65:46.72]Yeah, there's like an online feud, isn't there?
[65:50.61]People were saying that before.
[65:51.47]I don't know if we can play it together.
[65:54.44]Can we play it together?
[65:57.48]I have no idea.
[66:00.26]It's called Google Feud.
[66:04.52]Google Feud.
[66:05.96]Okay.
[66:06.66]Is it just like a browser game?
[66:08.36]I guess it's just Google Feud.
[66:10.21]I think we have to play this separately.
[66:13.81]Okay.
[66:14.53]I don't think we can play this together.
[66:16.21]Unless like... Yeah.
[66:19.07]Yeah.
[66:21.64]Yeah, there's nothing new on Steam.
[66:24.08]Yeah, well, so.
[66:26.32]Hey, thanks for coming out, Etalyx.
[66:29.60]I got a backup game, but it's also a single-player game.
[66:33.02]So we're going to sever the co-op stream here.
[66:40.34]There wasn't as much to do in Yeti-ville as hope.
[66:46.68]And we're really pressed for time, so that's a good one-hour co-op stream with Etalyx.
[66:53.63]And hey, Etalyx, hey, I'll see you real soon.
[66:58.57]Literally in eight hours.
[67:02.83]In real life.

[67:13.65]And we're going to play Google Feud to just us for like 30 minutes.
[67:18.07]I'm going to trap people in putt-putt holes.
[67:24.40]Oh, that's the donut game.
[67:25.64]I heard that was kind of fun.
