[00:08.24]Hey what is going on everybody Jerma here with a Diablo 3 video and this is my first Diablo 3 video if you're watching for the first time on my channel and you scroll back all the way to this video this is the first one and before I say anything I gotta tell you this game has lived up to a lot of expectations now
[00:27.94]I could do a total breakdown of what a pretty much a review of this game, but I'm not going to do that right now.
[00:33.38]I wanted to show you this because this is the fun part of Diablo.
[00:35.96]This is me, Shibby, 2142, Star, and MLC Stealth.
[00:41.72]All four people max people in a game, and we were doing Act 2.
[00:45.54]This is Act 2.
[00:47.24]And it does need to be mentioned that there are going to be some minor spoilers in this video.
[00:51.79]Because, of course, we're going to kill the Act 2 bosses.
[00:54.41]And if you don't want to see that, if you don't want to hear that, if you want to plug your ears and say la la la la la, that is totally fine.
[01:00.18]So when we get there, you're welcome to do that.
[01:02.72]I'm actually going to put an annotation on the screen when a somewhat of a pretty important spoiler is about to happen, so I will put that on the screen for you.
[01:11.17]And my full Diablo 3 review slash breakdown, that's going to come in probably the next couple weeks, because I do want to play through as much as I can, get through Nightmare, get through Hell, try Inferno, before I really give a last, final assessment of this game.
[01:25.65]So look for that in the next couple of weeks.
[01:27.97]Maybe a little sooner, but I'm just not sure yet.
[01:30.76]So besides that, the view schedule, the video schedule for this particular game is probably going to run like this.
[01:38.60]Because this is such a massive game, because there is so much to do, I don't think I'm going to make a Let's Play where I upload 500 videos or something like that.
[01:47.69]Like, oh, here's episode 1 of 10,000.
[01:50.51]I'm not sure I'm going to do that.
[01:52.13]What I'm going to do...
[01:54.03]is probably live stream this game.
[01:56.58]Take what I get on the live stream, put it over here on YouTube, so you might see, oh, we're in Nightmare this time, or we're in, oh, this is Hell Act 3, and I'll make sure to label it, make sure to annotate it, and the streams are going to be a lot longer now.
[02:09.06]That's one of the things I did want to talk about.
[02:10.98]So instead of the one hour or two hour long Team Fortress and Binding of Isaac type streams, they're now going to be like six or seven hours long, and...
[02:20.53]Hopefully I have my 720p streaming set up for YouTube.
[02:24.43]Because if that's all set up, that's going to be perfect.
[02:27.09]Because what will happen is right when the stream is done, if you don't want to sit there for the whole stream or if you have something to do, we all have busy schedules, you can come back later and watch it in 720.
[02:35.79]Rather than lately, it's been about 360 for all my streams.
[02:39.79]But that is the plan for Diablo 3, at least right now.
[02:43.09]I have another idea in my head that might come to fruition later.
[02:46.73]But for now, check out this video.
[02:48.67]It's going to be Act 2, the end of Act 2 in normal.
[02:51.38]This is the first reactions we had, so if you're wondering why I'm freaking out at certain points, it's because we never saw any of this stuff before, ever.
[02:59.12]So enjoy the live commentary, guys, and I will see you guys soon.
[03:02.86]And take care, everybody.
[03:09.06]Ooh.
[03:10.42]That's an Arab Blast.
[03:13.73]Rare Crossbow Arab Blast.
[03:15.95]Arab Blast, whatever you call this damn thing.
[03:19.09]Arab Blast?
[03:20.27]Arab Blast.
[03:21.63]Why are we in single file?
[03:25.76]Look at that.
[03:26.24]Look at Brett just nodding his head.
[03:30.26]Which one's me?
[03:31.56]I'm inside freaking Jerma's shield.
[03:34.04]We're all, like, cowering on each other.
[03:36.89]We look like Scooby-Doo and the gang.
[03:38.75]Just, like, all, like, riding up on each other.
[03:41.51]Alright, so hold on.
[03:42.25]Let me go through my skills book in the inventory.
[03:45.01]Don't do it.
[03:46.15]Hey, guys.
[03:46.56]Good boss fight.
[03:48.38]We got him.
[03:50.44]I picked up whatever you just dropped.
[03:52.14]I don't know what it is, but I want it.
[03:53.92]But I want it.
[03:54.50]I wanted it, so I took it.
[03:56.35]I want to go in.
[03:56.90]I'm going in.
[03:57.36]Okay, I'm going in.
[03:58.22]Alright, I'm going in.
[04:00.30]Aw.
[04:00.56]Accept.
[04:01.82]Star.
[04:02.64]Accept it.
[04:03.70]I thought I did, maybe.
[04:05.11]Oh, you did.
[04:05.45]You did.
[04:06.11]Okay.
[04:06.33]Here we go.
[04:07.91]Let's do it.
[04:09.03]Zoltan, cool.
[04:09.93]I'm going around.
[04:11.31]I'm going around.
[04:14.61]Is that a bad idea?
[04:15.31]Should I not come?
[04:16.79]Oh, they're slow-bubbling me.
[04:19.63]Come on, let's do it.
[04:20.87]Let's do it, Zoltan.
[04:21.87]What do you got, Zoltan?
[04:23.25]I'll take Zoltan for a ride.
[04:26.15]He's leveled up, too.
[04:31.13]Oh, Zoltan, what a jump.
[04:33.86]Yeah, I know.
[04:34.34]Look at this punk at this rate.
[04:35.68]What a jump!
[04:38.22]All that build-up for this guy just to take all this heat?
[04:42.00]Yeah, I know.
[04:42.52]All that power.
[04:44.79]Yeah, I thought you had a bunch of power.
[04:47.43]Well, all in a day's work, we just did it.
[04:48.89]Are you kidding me?
[04:50.01]What?
[04:52.01]Annihilated.
[04:52.93]Dude, is it like, now my true form, or was that it?
[04:55.66]No, that was it.
[04:59.34]Now my true form.
[05:00.64]That guy got so messed up.
[05:04.48]Dude, the butcher was hotter than that guy.
[05:07.57]The get hurt skill.
[05:09.23]Oh man, I'm getting like lag right here.
[05:11.67]That was bad news bears.
[05:13.47]This game.
[05:18.19]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[05:20.39]Yeah, I was pretty disappointed at first that you couldn't have like eight players in a lobby.
[05:23.98]Thank you.
[05:25.36]Thank you.
[05:25.92]Thank you for that.
[05:26.86]Thank you Blizzard for not allowing that to happen because that would be literally, it would be unplayable.
[05:33.88]You would just be right clicking and not even know where you were.
[05:37.33]Yeah, because everyone has so many skills they could spam now.
[05:40.53]That's why I turned on the low effects.
[05:42.59]I couldn't take it.
[05:46.07]Doesn't really change a whole lot anyways, though.
[05:48.15]Yeah.
[05:48.71]True death, true death.
[05:51.81]Oh, everything's already dead over here.
[05:53.35]Even the ground is fighting us.
[05:54.63]What is... I don't even... Man.
[06:01.86]I'm not even sure what I'm attacking anymore.
[06:03.62]I'm just... You're just walking.
[06:07.18]Things are just dying.
[06:08.02]Those were blue monsters, but who knew about it?
[06:10.05]I didn't know.
[06:11.27]We're just too super elite for them to handle us.
[06:16.57]Chest over here.
[06:19.91]Nothing good.
[06:20.56]Oh, there's Star doing the move again.
[06:22.90]I thought we were trying to encourage her to do it.
[06:24.98]Hurry!
[06:25.84]I must stay here and tend to Leia.
[06:28.39]Oh, boss.
[06:29.29]F9.
[06:29.43]Wait, wait, wait.
[06:30.49]Are we fighting Joffrey?
[06:32.35]I need to go through my inventory.
[06:33.59]We might be fighting Lyle.
[06:34.85]I don't know, dude.
[06:35.87]Cancel.
[06:36.45]Cancel.
[06:36.85]I need a moment.
[06:37.57]You guys.
[06:38.67]You guys.
[06:39.37]I need a moment.
[06:42.18]Jimmy.
[06:44.46]Update.
[06:45.38]Oh, God.
[06:45.92]Joffrey again?
[06:47.20]Joffrey.
[06:48.48]What if we kill him?
[06:49.28]Legendary drops and the server shuts down.
[06:51.64]Oh, they're about to shut down the servers right now?
[06:53.60]We better make this quick.
[06:55.31]We're too good.
[06:56.61]They caught on.
[07:01.33]I want to hear what he has to say about his stones, okay?
[07:04.05]It's so funny because I really want to know what he has to say, and I can't even hear a word he's saying.
[07:09.60]Me too.
[07:10.86]Dude, last time this happened.
[07:12.16]What?
[07:12.38]What?
[07:12.70]What?
[07:13.70]Service rundown.
[07:14.38]We have 15 minutes.
[07:16.66]He is Belial.
[07:18.72]I expected that.
[07:21.54]Wow.
[07:22.16]He's the lord of lies.
[07:23.64]You expect Belial would be not lying?
[07:25.20]I didn't think he was going to be like a kid.
[07:29.28]He's Joffrey.
[07:30.28]Joffrey was always a prick.
[07:32.36]So yeah, we have 15 minutes.
[07:33.90]Ladies, we're fine.
[07:35.38]When are the servers going down, did it say?
[07:38.04]15 minutes, that's what it just said.
[07:39.08]Alright, we can do this in 15 minutes, let's do it.
[07:42.44]Oh, are you serious about the servers going down?
[07:44.98]Yep.
[07:46.30]How do you know?
[07:47.23]It said in the bottom-left chat.
[07:49.19]Alright, we're fighting Belial right now.
[07:50.85]Oh, see, 14 minutes.
[07:55.22]Alright, just rape him.
[07:56.42]Okay.
[07:56.56]Oh my gosh, this guy's dead.
[07:57.46]Belial, you are not- you are worse than the first guy.
[07:59.55]You are a bad, bad Belial.
[08:05.31]I think we just all combined have way too many things to stun people.
[08:10.21]He's either stunned or frozen or dying.
[08:12.99]There's no in-between.
[08:13.83]Hey, get over here.
[08:15.78]Oh, great.
[08:16.28]Now his true form.
[08:17.24]Remember we said we talked about this?
[08:18.82]Oh, his true form.
[08:19.46]Oh, he's like Zarbon.
[08:21.04]Zarbon.
[08:21.58]Oh, okay.
[08:24.45]Oh my god.
[08:25.43]Oh my god.
[08:27.57]This is terrifying.
[08:29.23]What do we do?
[08:31.08]What do we do?
[08:31.48]I'm running.
[08:33.92]I can't shoot that far.
[08:36.36]Oh my god.
[08:36.98]He's going like getting Jerma.
[08:38.52]How does this work?
[08:40.13]Oh my god.
[08:41.27]Come on, come at me, Belial.
[08:42.97]You are the lord of lies.
[08:45.55]I did.
[08:47.59]Yeah, I'll just Whirlwind his ass.
[08:49.75]Can I be revived mid-combat or is that not possible?
[08:52.18]Nope, you can.
[08:52.80]I think you can.
[08:54.34]Can you?
[08:54.62]I think somebody has to be a monk, don't think?
[08:55.96]Oh, nice.
[08:57.94]Oh, you can bring him back.
[08:58.64]There you go.
[09:00.26]Oh, dead.
[09:00.92]Insta-dead.
[09:01.42]Don't stay in the poison.
[09:02.28]Don't stay in the poison.
[09:03.26]Don't you know the poison?
[09:03.82]Jeremy, get me up.
[09:04.22]You have the most health.
[09:05.06]You can get me.
[09:05.72]101.
[09:06.46]What the hell?
[09:07.96]Hold on.
[09:08.28]I'm getting somebody.
[09:08.82]I'm getting somebody.
[09:09.32]I don't know who it is.
[09:10.66]I'm doing it again.
[09:11.28]Here we go.
[09:12.32]I am running for my life.
[09:13.34]Hold on.
[09:15.82]Use your potions.
[09:16.22]Oh my god, you guys are all dying instantly.
[09:22.89]Just Ryan for my life.
[09:26.53]You ain't got nothing.
[09:33.41]Oh, I blocked it.
[09:34.19]Oh my good god.
[09:39.62]Looks like my bubble's actually getting him.
[09:42.26]Yeah, I think as long as you're on the outskirts, you can hit him.
[09:45.19]Oh, he had better drop.
[09:46.11]He had better drop.
[09:47.21]That almost killed me.
[09:51.08]Oh, no, no, no.
[09:53.00]Please.
[09:54.34]Fortunately, ice armor is totally balanced.
[09:58.82]And fair.
[10:00.25]And everywhere.
[10:00.99]Legendary.
[10:01.51]Oh, come on.
[10:03.23]What's he got?
[10:04.95]What'd he drop?
[10:05.33]Nothing.
[10:07.23]Holy shit.
[10:08.31]Oh, dude, that's cool.
[10:11.25]I see... No.
[10:11.83]We got a rare H. I was really hoping for something.
[10:19.65]I got three yellows.
[10:21.51]Damn.
[10:22.59]That was cool, though.
[10:24.06]I got two yellows and, like, three blues.
[10:27.32]I got a couple of yellows, but, you know, whatevs.
