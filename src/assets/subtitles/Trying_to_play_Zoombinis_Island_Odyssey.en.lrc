[00:00.55]I think it was like some sort of currency thing.
[00:02.85]Uh, I'm gonna install it right now.
[00:04.21]Uh, Zumbini's Island Odyssey.
[00:06.47]This one looks like shit.
[00:09.80]It looks worse than this one.
[00:13.28]The solution is not to play.
[00:14.32]Where's my, where's my webcam so I can have content?
[00:17.50]Hold on.
[00:17.96]I gotta have, like, content for a minute.
[00:23.81]Show us your baldness.
[00:24.81]I mean, well, you're gonna get a pretty good fucking look in a minute.
[00:29.25]Here, look.
[00:31.64]There it is.
[00:32.02]Okay.
[00:36.04]It's not bald.
[00:36.66]It's just parted weirdly because I didn't comb it.
[00:42.99]I don't care about this.
[00:45.41]I care about getting the logical journey of the Zumbinis 3 to work.
[00:49.71]Forget my Gary Oldman haircut.
[00:51.97]That's not important right now.
[00:58.42]I'm like staring at my phone.
[01:01.55]I'm like, I'm like waiting for, I'm waiting for my like girlfriend to call me.
[01:05.75]You know what I mean?
[01:06.27]Like, did she call yet?
[01:08.67]Did she call yet?
[01:12.95]I'm not going, I know I'm not going bald.
[01:14.38]I'm fine.
[01:16.42]He's going to open this up.
[01:18.58]So now we're going to play this until 10 PM is the, is the hour there.
[01:26.58]I have to like start a fire to open this.
[01:29.15]Come on, man.
[01:34.01]Watch this not even work on Windows 10.
[01:36.11]I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:42.03]Oh my god.
[01:43.93]Can I seriously not get into this?
[01:48.27]Just get a knife?
[01:49.05]I don't have any knives down here.
[01:50.31]You think I have knives down here?
[01:53.32]Get a knife!
[01:54.24]I don't have knives in my house.
[01:59.18]If I need to cut something...
[02:02.64]like that and it does it why do you need a knife you don't need a knife oh but how are you like how do you cut your meat you have like oh you bought a steak and you seared it for one minute aside like dirt and then you like put it in your mouth and you rip it out just like you like we are supposed to as animals is there a second coating on here
[02:40.32]It's going to take five seconds to install this, by the way.
[02:44.46]There we go.
[02:47.44]You can tell when a game is old when it looks like this.
[02:51.22]This is an old fucking game.
[02:54.38]By the way, which one is which?
[02:56.47]I don't know.
[02:59.21]I have no idea.
[03:02.43]I don't know if we're going to take a guess.
[03:03.45]Guess, guess, guess.

[03:05.85]Yes!
[03:17.42]Ruining the discs.
[03:20.18]It's a fucking logical journey of the Zumbinis.
[03:22.59]Who cares?
[03:24.37]Ruining the discs.
[03:25.49]Hey, I'll give you a disc that gets ruined.
[03:27.71]Ten seconds, it's coming out.
[03:30.31]I hope the screen doesn't crash, though, for real.
[03:33.29]Give me one second.
[03:34.53]I need to actually make sure this doesn't break.
[03:35.91]You're gonna hear a loud... You're gonna hear a couple of loud noises.
