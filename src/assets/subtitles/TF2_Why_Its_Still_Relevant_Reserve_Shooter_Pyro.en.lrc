[00:08.83]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:11.10]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:16.22]And tonight, I'm gonna be playing as the Pyro.
[00:19.00]And before I get started, I do have to apologize.
[00:21.32]I am getting a little bit of a cold.
[00:23.34]Because I went to Burgah Boy's house, and Burgah Boy, of course, has a cold.
[00:27.30]And I'm gonna get it.
[00:28.40]So I'm getting a stuffy nose now, I'm getting a little bit of a head cold.
[00:31.48]But, you know, I had this topic in my head...
[00:33.88]And I wanted to go over it a little bit.
[00:35.12]I wanted to talk about it with you guys because I find it to be very, very important.
[00:39.24]And it has to do with why has Team Fortress lasted this long?
[00:44.33]And when I say this long, I'm really talking about why has the community stayed for this long?
[00:51.59]Why have we been playing this game for over five years?
[00:54.63]At least for me, I've been playing this game.
[00:56.80]for over five years.
[00:58.36]I started back in Team Fortress Classic, as a lot of you guys know, and I've been playing this game ever since, and I've never got that urge to stop playing.
[01:06.04]Sure, I've taken a couple breaks here and there.
[01:07.68]I've taken one or two breaks, maybe one or two months.
[01:10.90]I don't feel like playing it, whatever.
[01:12.11]I'll wait for some updates.
[01:13.33]But I always come back.
[01:15.19]There's never been a time when I haven't played this game between two or three months.
[01:19.91]And it was actually during this gameplay, right here, that I had this epiphany, I guess you could call it.
[01:26.94]My brain was kind of just telling me, Jeremy, why are you still playing this game?
[01:32.34]It's been five years and you're still having this much fun playing this game?
[01:36.65]Because I love this game.
[01:38.75]This is one of my favorite games, probably my number one favorite game of all time.
[01:43.23]And it's really slugged its way up there.
[01:46.11]It never was like that.
[01:47.37]This game was probably two or three on the list.
[01:49.98]But it's made its way up to number one, and I'm trying to think why.
[01:54.50]And the answer is very, very simple.
[01:56.20]And I thought about this for a while, but it's very, very simple.
[01:59.38]It has to do with developer attention.
[02:03.27]Now, I'm going to bring up a couple of different companies here and a couple of different game franchises.
[02:07.79]This is not meant to hate on anyone.
[02:10.53]I love these games as well.
[02:12.10]I play these games all the time.
[02:14.06]So don't worry, this is not me saying, well, this game sucks.
[02:17.96]No, no, no, that's not what I'm saying.
[02:19.54]But anyways...
[02:20.92]Take a look at Call of Duty or Battlefield 3.
[02:24.24]There are recent iterations, I'm not talking about the franchises in general, of Modern Warfare 3 and Battlefield 3.
[02:29.30]So they get content updates, they get patches, bug fixes, all that kind of stuff all the time.
[02:34.10]The main problem with those updates are, there's a couple of things that I think are wrong with the industry right now, but mostly those content updates are usually not free, at least for Call of Duty.
[02:45.85]And they're not really that much of a change.
[02:47.77]They're adding maybe some maps, they're buffing or nerfing a gun or something like that.
[02:52.32]The changes that they make are not that drastic and they're not that forward-moving.
[02:58.40]You go to Team Fortress though, almost all of Team Fortress' big updates are massive, massive game-changing updates.
[03:07.29]And that's why people keep coming back.
[03:09.27]That's why I keep playing, that's why I keep my butt sitting in the chair, because I know they're gonna add something crazy for the Soldier, they're gonna add something insane.
[03:18.17]Look at the Pyro, the Phlogistinator, nobody really saw that coming.
[03:21.86]And they keep trying to change the game, and they keep listening to the community.
[03:26.22]And the reason why this all came up when I was playing Pyro is very, very important.
[03:31.54]the Pyro back in 2007 is wildly different than the Pyro now.
[03:37.96]They didn't even have a compression blast.
[03:40.74]The compression blast was added into the game in an update.
[03:44.04]So you gotta remember, the Pyro before the compression blast
[03:47.09]You were an ambusher.
[03:48.45]You kinda hid behind corners, you WM1'd into people, and you only had a default shotgun.
[03:54.03]And you couldn't blow anybody away, pull the shotgun out like we do now, and shoot people.
[03:58.46]That's not how it used to work.
[04:00.18]You just used to run down a hallway holding down the mouse button.
[04:03.74]Now look at what you can do as the Pyro now.
[04:06.04]There are so many fun, incredible options to play with.
[04:10.37]There's the flare gun.
[04:11.69]There's the Reserve Shooter, which I'm using right now.
[04:14.45]There's the detonator.
[04:15.75]Or you could just use the default shotgun.
[04:17.47]And they keep adding more stuff.
[04:19.67]And there's the Manmelter.
[04:20.75]There's all kinds of stuff.
[04:22.59]And I think that's why the game has lasted so long.
[04:25.41]That is why this game is still one of the best.
[04:27.99]That's still why everybody keeps playing it.
[04:30.59]They just have so much attention to their franchises, and they really care about what's going into their games.
[04:36.50]And that's not to say that DICE and, you know, Infinity Ward and Treyarch, they don't put a lot of time into their games.
[04:41.70]That's not what I'm saying.
[04:42.84]Of course they do.
[04:44.26]All these game developers, they put blood, sweat, and tears into all their products.
[04:48.70]But it's just the way that Valve goes about doing business that I seem to really, really love.
[04:53.83]And what you're watching right now, by the way, is you watched a spy clip, a little bonus clip, of just a sequence of ridiculous events.
[05:00.53]I couldn't even believe that all happened, but...
[05:03.46]Wanted to add that because, of course, the pyro game was a little short.
[05:06.56]So, thank you all so much for watching.
[05:08.56]This is going to wrap up the video.
[05:10.20]And keep the discussion going in the comment section, guys.
[05:13.33]Let me know what you got to say about all this.
[05:15.33]I would love to jump in and chime in on some of the comments as well.
[05:17.83]So, let me know what you think.
[05:19.35]And, of course, happy Mother's Day to all you mothers or all of your mothers.
[05:24.60]I think I phrased that right.
[05:26.14]But, yeah, happy Mother's Day, everybody.
[05:27.36]I'm a day late, but it's okay.
[05:29.00]At least it's the thought that counts.
[05:31.70]So yeah, take it easy, guys.
[05:32.84]Black screen.
[05:33.40]I got to get out of here.
[05:34.14]So I'll see you guys all next time.
[05:36.29]And take care, everybody.
