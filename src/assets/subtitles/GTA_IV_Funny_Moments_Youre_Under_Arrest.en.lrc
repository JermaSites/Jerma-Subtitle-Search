[00:00.69]I have a knife!
[00:01.57]You two are not even touching each other right now!
[00:07.30]There's so many people over there- OH GOODNESS!
[00:10.20]My face!
[00:11.06]I didn't even see you there, I wasn't even looking that way.
[00:13.68]That was a very unfortunate positioning for you.
[00:16.01]I was just hanging out by the coppers.
[00:20.15]Oh!
[00:24.53]I don't think your hit killed me, I think when I pinballed... Hit the ground, yeah.
[00:29.47]That killed me.
[00:31.45]Oh, not again.
[00:32.15]Not again, jump!
[00:32.59]Oh shit, the rails.
[00:33.76]I made it!
[00:34.56]Did you fall over the rail?
[00:35.40]I fell over the edge.
[00:36.78]Driving down there.
[00:37.68]I barely dodged your attack, Boo.
[00:39.76]Where are you?
[00:41.00]I jumped down here.
[00:41.68]I'm down here.
[00:42.08]No, I'm trying to, like, find you.
[00:43.00]Oh, right.
[00:43.28]I'm going to, like, over the top rope kind of land on you.
[00:47.44]Oh, shit.
[00:55.81]Raymond Stereo from the top turnbuckle.
[00:57.39]Yeah, Jerma just, like, threw me out the Royal Rumble.
[01:00.91]He just, like, catched me on the way down.
[01:03.38]What the hell was that?
[01:05.51]What's going on?
[01:06.17]I'm getting in the back- No, no, I don't want to get in the backseat now!
[01:08.47]Jesus!
[01:08.75]There's a car exploding!
[01:09.87]Let me out!
[01:11.55]Etalyx, are you shooting us from afar with an explosive sniper rifle?
[01:15.76]Who, me?
[01:17.18]You!
[01:18.04]This play session, explosions are Etalyx.
[01:20.56]Hey, I didn't kill you!
[01:21.58]Look at him, he's like posted up behind cover.
[01:24.40]This is what I think of your cover.
[01:26.62]Oh shit.
[01:30.34]Oh!
[01:31.33]Ow, that looks so painful on my side.
[01:33.79]Hi, Etalyx!
[01:36.45]I see you have explosives in your hand.
[01:38.05]I do, I was aiming them downwind of- of- Jerma, run away!
[01:41.16]Oh, no!
[01:45.14]Oh, he got me, even though I was dead still.
[01:49.44]I don't know how I missed- I missed, like, both of you guys somehow.
[01:52.73]Oh, you definitely did, Etalyx, though.
[01:56.67]Oh, by the way, this car's on fire.
[01:59.10]I'm going out with the ship.
[02:00.86]I'm going down with the ship.
[02:03.67]Here we go.
[02:04.23]No, I want this car.
[02:06.99]Never mind.
[02:08.47]How good is this jump?
[02:10.36]It's not.
[02:10.76]We gotta back up a ways, but we gotta pick up Boo first.
[02:12.74]Wait, Boo's gotta get in here.
[02:14.28]We got cops coming.
[02:15.92]I have stars.
[02:16.74]I think Boo definitely has stars.
[02:20.28]It's okay, officers!
[02:21.32]We have this under control!
[02:22.52]Go, go, go, go, go!
[02:25.94]We've captured him.
[02:26.66]It's alright.
[02:27.24]You can stop chasing.
[02:28.43]We got him!
[02:28.75]He's under arrest.
[02:35.57]Alright, so we're gonna start... Is this a jump?
[02:36.71]No, no, no, no, no.
[02:37.71]He's broken his wrist.
[02:39.11]I gotta turn around, and we gotta go around the way, so I gotta try not to crash into a whole bunch of... Oh, my wrist!
[02:43.41]Alright, seriously, look.
[02:44.51]It looks like we went through a tunnel, and our arms, like, broke in the tunnel.
[02:50.54]Oh, no!
[02:51.04]I didn't mean to jump out!
[02:53.68]Asshole.
[02:54.20]Sorry, I really didn't mean to do that.
[02:56.94]This is a better car.
[02:58.10]I think Blake's gonna die here, Gemma.
[03:01.91]It's like in the back seat.
[03:03.31]No big deal.
[03:04.99]I wasn't lying.
[03:06.27]I wasn't lying.
[03:07.03]No, I want passenger.
[03:08.87]I want shotgun.
[03:12.80]I can't believe we made this.
[03:14.14]Oh, I have three stars.
[03:15.08]What did I do wrong?
[03:16.90]Yeah, Boo, you like ditched us into a bunch of cops and me and Boo were just in the back seat.
[03:21.02]Just hanging out.
[03:22.14]Alright, you gotta like go this way and then we gotta turn around and try to get some speed.
[03:26.99]But there's so many cops!
[03:27.81]Through all this, like... Hey, I'm just dead in the backseat pool right now.
[03:33.37]Have you seen how many... Wait, pick me up!
[03:35.83]Pick me up!
[03:36.53]We're going straight this way.
[03:37.61]It's just straight down this road.
[03:39.28]Holy crap, there's a number of cops.
[03:43.84]There goes the hood.
[03:45.14]We actually have a busted wheel.
[03:46.10]No, wait a minute.
[03:47.52]I gotta get out.
[03:48.34]Here we go, self!
[03:52.99]Oh, I see the jump.
[03:53.67]Parachute!
[03:54.57]Parachute!
[03:55.83]No!
[03:59.17]Oh my god, I just watched you do that, Beau.
[04:03.47]I just defied gravity and then face-planted into a rock.
[04:06.19]Yeah, I face-planted into the water.
[04:08.21]I, like, magnetically attracted myself.
[04:10.91]Oh, it even made a crunch sound when I hit the rock.
[04:13.53]Alright, one more time.
[04:14.13]We all have to get in the same car and do it.
[04:16.23]Okay.
[04:17.05]A fast four-seater.
[04:18.51]Yeah, let's get everybody in the car.
[04:20.17]I'm coming!
[04:21.74]Alright, hold off your trigger fingers.
[04:24.08]Oh, I'm gonna get killed first so I can take away my stars.
[04:26.86]Oh, what the hell?
[04:27.78]Why do we have three stars?
[04:29.18]All I did was get in the back of the car.
[04:33.58]I have three stars right now.
[04:35.12]I didn't do anything.
[04:40.13]God, I really want to watch this back and see what the hell we even did wrong.
[04:44.55]I think you just shot a cop in the head, like, twice.
[04:46.99]Alright, well, let's turn this around.
[04:51.76]And why did I get the stars?
[04:53.05]Usually it's just you, right?
[04:54.93]You are so an accomplice right now.
[04:58.41]I got one star just for sitting in this car.
[05:01.18]I got three stars upon entering the back seat.
[05:04.08]Oh, I got an idea.
[05:06.93]Very that's a good idea.
[05:09.75]Hey, it's a good idea.
[05:11.31]Yeah guys just screwed cuz here they come I know it left me
[05:22.74]I think one of us should go on a motorcycle.
[05:25.44]Or just all of us maybe die and lose our stars.
[05:28.76]I can't get in.
[05:30.89]We're going off.
[05:31.79]Wait for me.
[05:34.35]This car is so screwed up.
[05:38.07]We're not getting any speed.
[05:41.75]We're going so slow we're actually turned around and going the opposite direction.
[05:48.69]There are only cop cars in the city.
[05:55.00]This is like Driver on PlayStation 1.
[05:57.46]Here we go!
[06:00.20]Here we go.
[06:00.90]Yay!
[06:02.10]Yay!
[06:06.90]Oh, that sucked.
[06:08.80]My head hurts.
