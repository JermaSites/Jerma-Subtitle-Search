[00:14.76]Hello.
[00:20.26]Dropping a lot of frames right now.
[00:25.54]This might be tricky here.
[00:27.70]Let's see.
[00:29.44]Give me one second, guys.
[00:34.66]Why am I dropping so many frames?
[00:41.12]I don't understand.
[00:41.72]My CPU usage is fine.
[00:45.71]My... Is my upload seriously fucking up again?
[00:49.73]Don't even tell me.
[00:53.43]Like, why am I getting, like, all these awful dropped-ass frames?
[00:58.31]10% of my frames are getting dropped.
[00:59.49]What?
[00:59.73]How?
[00:59.93]What the hell is even going on here?
[01:04.85]Well, um... Don't ask me how.
[01:11.86]Snake stream?
[01:15.55]Yeah, something's going on with my upload right now.
[01:17.41]I thought the problem was my mic.
[01:19.01]No.
[01:20.23]Comcast is striking again, boys and girls.
[01:25.32]Comcast strikes again.
[01:26.64]Hmm.
[01:33.42]Well, this is bullshit.
[01:38.95]Already, like... It's just going... It's all over the place.
[01:44.01]I can see it over here.
[01:47.73]Hold on.
[01:49.75]Yeah.
[01:53.68]Let me see.
[01:54.14]Let's do a test here.
[01:55.20]I wonder, can you guys even see the game?
[01:59.86]I'm just going to put the game on.
[02:02.96]Well, we were going to play this, but we might not be able to play this.
[02:06.62]No?
[02:07.24]Are we dead?
[02:08.34]Is it back?
[02:10.19]My upload is dead.
[02:14.65]Well, hey, welcome to the stream.
[02:19.90]Give me a fucking break.
[02:24.22]I thought it was like a... I thought my fucking mic was screwed up.
[02:26.64]No.
[02:27.60]Anyways, thanks SticksRenegade for the 10 bucks.
[02:29.58]I'm not sure how long we're going to be here for.
[02:33.82]Jeremy, you know why some of the audio cut out last week?
[02:35.70]Most of your donation callouts were cut off on Tuesday.
[02:38.73]They were?
[02:41.25]Were they?
[02:41.87]I thought I said most of them.
[02:44.53]Or as many of them as I could, but thank you for the 10 bucks, dude.
[02:52.99]I'm dropping 20% of everything.
[02:55.13]Let's just do something real quick here.
[02:56.29]Can you guys see this moving around?
[02:59.19]How bad is this?
[03:00.21]Is this really jittery and terrible?
[03:06.29]Ugh.
[03:07.77]Fuck.
[03:08.93]Come on.
[03:13.15]Come on.
[03:15.03]This is not cool.
[03:15.83]All I can do here is just sit here and talk.
[03:20.23]Maybe that's what we'll do.
[03:22.03]Oh, somebody just gave a hundred bucks.
[03:24.23]I don't even know if I'm going to be able to stream tonight.
[03:27.46]Hold on.
[03:27.80]Somebody... Oh, God.
[03:28.68]Where did it go?
[03:30.38]I just, like, freaked out.
[03:32.44]Rampaging scrub.
[03:34.14]Oh, God.
[03:34.64]Hold on.
[03:36.44]Stay right there.
[03:36.96]I'm going to, like, play the... I'll get it to happen.
[03:39.77]I don't know why that just, like, turned off.
[03:41.67]Hold on.
[03:41.83]One second.
[03:43.25]Hold on.
[03:52.28]Wait, wait, wait.
[03:53.28]I'll get it back.
[03:53.92]I'll get it back.
[03:56.22]I will get it back.
[03:59.74]Alright, here it comes.
[04:02.91]See?
[04:03.57]Oh my god.
[04:04.27]I just gave myself a hundred bucks too.
[04:05.87]There you go.
[04:08.37]There's your beer conga line.
[04:11.31]There's your beer conga line.
[04:14.31]Rampaging scrub.
[04:15.10]He just wanted to see it.
[04:17.00]There you go.
[04:19.37]This is supposed to be Rampaging Scrub's name, by the way, not mine.
[04:24.83]But unfortunately, we might have to... I don't know.
[04:27.29]Wait, wait, wait.
[04:27.69]It seems like it's okay.
[04:28.87]Is it stable?
[04:29.65]Are we stable yet?
[04:32.79]Ugh, it is just... God damn it.
[04:39.23]This shit ain't cool, man.
[04:40.83]Right when you think the world is going well.
[04:43.73]But thank you so much, Rampaging Scrub.
[04:46.30]That's a hundred bucks.
[04:47.34]I hope I can fucking stream.
[04:48.60]We're going to try to ride this out for a little bit.
[04:50.04]We're just going to sit here and hang out.
[04:54.54]Because now it's unstable again.
[04:56.80]But thank you, Never Trust Purple for the $10.
[04:59.08]Yes, I've been waiting for you to play this.
[05:00.49]And I want to play this so bad on stream.
[05:04.69]But we're all over the place on upload right now.
[05:10.89]I'm gonna sit here and fucking ride it out.
[05:13.55]Let's just like, hold on, let me make sure my pants are zipped up.
[05:20.61]Because we're at like 2,000 up.
[05:24.24]We're like 1,500k up right now, and that's not cool.
[05:27.46]I'm just, wait, wait, wait.
[05:28.56]Dude, whoever's like on my street fucking like torrenting the Spongebob movie, stop.
[05:36.20]Stop.
[05:40.18]Oh my god, no, guys, guys, I had to... I might not even be able to do a legit stream tonight.
[05:46.06]And I'm getting like fucking hundreds of dollars.
[05:51.29]Oh, you guys are fucking too much for me.
[05:53.47]RainbowDream12, thank you for the hundred dollars.
[05:56.15]They don't have a message, it just says cheer... Just cheer one thousand, ten thousand.
[06:02.68]Thank you so much, dude.
[06:04.24]That's... I feel bad, I might... The stream might just turn off.
[06:11.34]But thank you.
[06:14.61]The thing is, though, it seems to be getting better and then getting worse.
[06:17.77]So I don't know what to do.
[06:19.31]I can just turn on the webcam and just hang out for a little bit.
[06:23.21]Hold on.
[06:25.11]I look like shit today.
[06:26.37]And that might kill the stream, though.
[06:27.59]That's the thing I'm concerned about.
[06:29.59]That actually might kill the stream.
[06:33.58]God damn it.
[06:35.10]Well, I'm not going to tweet out the stream or anything.
[06:36.90]We'll just see if we can ride this out.
[06:40.50]And let me just... Where's my webcam?
[06:41.90]My webcam's not even plugged in.
[06:45.37]ComStream 2.
[06:48.65]Me turning on the webcam might actually kill the stream.
[06:51.23]Because it might not be able to handle it.
[06:53.48]It can handle a blank-ass screen like this, but can it handle movement?
[06:56.64]Who knows?
[06:59.04]ComStream, ComStream.
[07:02.02]But I wasn't prepared to do an IRL stream.
[07:06.44]I wanted to do this funny, this funny game.
[07:08.72]Hold on.
[07:09.24]You're gonna hear, by the way, you're gonna hear a Windows do-dun.
[07:13.68]Here it comes.
[07:18.06]And that was really loud.
[07:19.02]I'm so sorry.
[07:22.42]I got a clean room though now.
[07:25.36]Maybe the snake will show up.
[07:29.82]My hair looks like shit.
[07:30.80]I didn't get a haircut.
[07:34.24]This is not even like correct.
[07:35.35]Snake stream.
[07:39.37]Now, you tell me, like, you tell me how, like, screwed up this is.
[07:41.95]And I can't even... Hold on.
[07:45.13]Video capture device.
[07:48.49]I gotta, like, turn that off.
[07:49.93]Okay.
[07:52.61]Hey, thank you, ChromeFox4 for the 10 bucks.
[07:55.13]And thank you, StixRenegade for the 10 bucks as well.
[07:58.23]Yeah.
[08:00.44]Oh, well.
[08:02.94]Let's see what I look like.
[08:03.82]My pants are zipped up, I hope.
[08:05.98]I at least, like, hope that.
[08:14.24]Hi!
[08:16.67]I don't have my, like, typical webcam set up here.
[08:18.93]This is gonna be, like, you guys can't even, like, see my face right now.
[08:21.25]Can you even see my face?
[08:23.67]Like, just barely?
[08:27.31]How are the dropped frames?
[08:28.35]Am I, like, bouncing around all over the place?
[08:30.07]Or can you, like, hear what I'm saying?
[08:31.33]And see what I'm saying?
[08:33.07]It says I'm dropping 20% of every single frame.
[08:38.44]Oh, Dad's Pac-Man shirt!
[08:39.52]I forgot!
[08:40.58]Take a look at this fucking thing.
[08:41.76]How awesome is that?
[08:44.78]Yeah, best character ever.
[08:46.22]Alright, let me just... I love your shirt.
[08:52.61]Demonize.
[08:53.05]Yeah, we'll go back to the demonize.
[09:00.25]It actually looks like it's clearing up.
[09:03.07]Let me try this.
[09:07.90]Okay, I think it's cleared up.
[09:11.76]We ran over the fucking hedge.
[09:21.45]Hold on.
[09:21.89]Give me one second, guys.
[09:25.31]I'm going to be right back.
[09:26.25]Give me one second.
[11:39.10]Alright, we're just going to go for it.
[11:41.72]I'm dropping like 10% of all my frames, but hopefully once I start going here, it'll even out.
[11:47.67]Sorry, guys.
[11:49.09]It's just the internet.
[11:50.19]The internet sucks.
[11:51.81]That's all you need to know.
[11:53.61]Okay, when is fucking Congress going to pass the internet sucks bill?
[12:00.08]Get me into that town hall.
[12:03.34]I'll come to that town hall and I will write that bill where it's like the internet has to stop sucking
[12:09.84]And, like, bring, like, the Comcast representative there.
[12:12.76]And he'll be sitting there.
[12:13.58]He'll say, that, like, fat fuck, whoever it is.
[12:15.55]I don't even know if he's, like, fat.
[12:19.73]He'll be sitting there with his, like, crown on and his, like, sultan cape, like, Oh, Halloween!
[12:24.66]How dare you try to tell me that my internet service provider is not the best!
[12:29.96]That's driving me to drink soda.
[12:35.01]We're gonna try it.
[12:36.41]Whatever.
[12:37.69]Not much I can do about it.
[12:38.83]Close your ears.
[12:40.11]Here comes a loud noise.
[12:41.15]Turn your volume down.
[12:43.23]I can assure you, I'm warning you very, very nicely.
[12:45.87]Turn your volume down.
[12:47.97]And turn it back up in like another 30 seconds.
[12:53.70]Okay.
[12:55.54]Let's get that off.
[12:56.36]Move back to the game.
[12:58.58]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[12:59.64]I mean, it's just bearable enough where like I'm dropping frames, but I'm still able to stream.
[13:08.05]So we're just going to hope that it fucking gets by whatever the hell is going on.
[13:19.01]Loud stream.
[13:19.93]That wasn't even that loud.
[13:20.81]Oh, no, never mind.
[13:21.53]It's because I turned this down.
[13:23.43]Alright, let's turn this up.
[13:26.39]Let's get it to 4%.
[13:29.54]Or 2% or something.
[13:30.88]Okay.
[13:32.80]This is Ultimate Epic Battle Simulator.
[13:38.16]Why don't you lower the bitrate?
[13:40.04]Um... It's not gonna help.
[13:41.94]Because... It might... Oh, God.
[13:45.50]My, uh... Upload is dropping down to, like... 500k.
[13:50.40]So, even if I were to drop the bitrate, it doesn't even matter.
[13:53.44]My, like... I'm at, like, 0.5 upload.
[13:55.98]Sometimes, randomly.
[13:57.39]So, that's not gonna help.
[13:58.59]See, right now, it's at, like, 4,000.
[14:00.23]Like, 3,500, 3,500, 3,500.
[14:00.67]Oh, no!
[14:01.05]It dropped down to 1,000!
[14:01.53]Like, there's no way I would even know.
[14:03.29]Unfortunately...
[14:11.67]Dude, when you're at like the fucking mercy of random ass companies, that shit just like sucks.
[14:22.29]But whatever.
[14:23.07]I mean, I thought I'm going to just do overall quality like media.
[14:26.37]I thought it was like the game that was fucking me up.
[14:28.09]Apparently not.
[14:29.18]Stay on high.
[14:34.68]So if it becomes unbearable, I'm sorry.
[14:38.54]There's nothing I can do about it at this point.
[14:43.66]I'm so angry right now.
[14:46.34]It's like every fucking couple months this shit just happens.
[14:50.62]It's like Congress passed the fucking internet, like, can't suck bill.
[14:55.76]So Comcast has to replace all their shitty infrastructure.
[15:01.23]That's what I keep getting told.
[15:02.19]It's like, oh, well, you see, you know down the street somebody blew it out with, like, they set up their wireless router wrong and it fucked up the whole network.
[15:09.83]Why the fuck is that even allowed?
[15:12.56]Yeah, you see, one of our nodes is, like, fucking 40 years old and, like, I, like, have to, like, kick it, like, ding!
[15:18.30]Like, after I fucking take a wrench and, like, wrench the side of it and, like, it's fucking buried under, like, three feet of dirt.
[15:28.03]Fucking replace all this shit.
[15:29.17]And, like, don't... If you... Comcast, listen to me.
[15:32.43]If people can, like, fucking set up their DIY of what router's wrong and it fucking kills the whole street...
[15:38.67]Don't fucking let him do it.
[15:40.47]You do it.
[15:41.65]What the fuck?
[15:43.55]That's what I keep getting told.
[15:46.02]I keep getting told, somebody on the next block shit on their modem and it killed it.
[15:51.96]What the fuck is that possible?
[15:56.73]Let's go.
[15:57.79]And now I'm like, now I'm upset.
[15:58.91]Now I'm just upset.
[16:02.09]Now I'm just angry.
[16:03.47]Now I'm just angry.
[16:09.44]See if I can make myself feel a little better.
[16:13.72]That comb.
[16:20.69]Yeah.
[16:25.39]Let's go.
[16:28.59]Alright, so... This game... How this game works... I'm, like, so on tilt right now because this is fucking stupid.
[16:36.28]But anyways... This game is about...
[16:39.64]gigantic battles you make a bunch of units you have them fight each other on various maps and you can either watch or you can take uh you can you can participate yourself so uh unit custom let's take a look you can choose from like all kinds of units and like all their different like health pools and stuff like that so it's it's pretty interesting who knows
[17:04.39]So, uh, unit.
[17:06.69]Footman, like, look at this all.
[17:08.04]Look at it.
[17:08.30]You got, like, chickens.
[17:10.76]Wild man.
[17:13.38]Catapult.
[17:14.00]That's, like, a person, apparently.
[17:15.16]Archer.
[17:16.36]Footman.
[17:17.44]Giant ogre.
[17:19.97]And I can have as many of these as I want and on as many teams as I want.
[17:25.21]Orc.
[17:27.60]Fucking penguins?
[17:28.52]Are you gonna have penguins fight each other?
[17:31.34]Zombie?
[17:33.00]Persian soldier?
[17:35.05]Fucking turtles?
[17:37.53]So, theoretically, I could have one giant turtle, or one giant archer.
[17:45.11]Let's be very normal here.
[17:45.95]Be very normal.
[17:51.84]Let's start with like... We'll just see what happens when we actually do this.
[17:57.40]We can come back to this later.
[17:59.67]So we'll have... I don't know.
[18:02.57]Let's see here.
[18:11.53]So.
[18:12.63]I guess we'll just do... Fantasy?
[18:15.69]Fantasy?
[18:17.84]We'll have Team Fantasy versus Team Animals.
[18:20.58]No, we're not going to go.
[18:21.24]That's a joke.
[18:21.74]We're not going to the joke yet.
[18:23.34]Okay, let's just do, like, Footmen versus Orc.
[18:29.13]Orders, like, hold position.
[18:30.71]And these, like, these guys will attack.
[18:33.67]We'll go to the City of Lost Crusades.
[18:35.33]Weather, it's going to be rainy.
[18:37.69]And it's 7am.
[18:38.41]That's when I start streaming.
[18:41.43]7pm.
[18:42.21]That's when the stream starts.
[18:46.24]So, amount, there's 250 orcs versus 250 footmen.
[18:53.47]I mean, I can put them in a different spot, right?
[18:57.89]Okay, so here are the orcs.
[18:58.95]They're going to be like inside the building.
[19:01.97]So they obviously can have, they got to have a little bit less numbers.
[19:04.66]We'll have like 400 medieval footmen coming in this door here.
[19:11.62]Then we go in this way.
[19:15.26]And these guys will be this way.
[19:18.92]Let's just see.
[19:19.68]I'm curious.
[19:20.04]Let's see what happens.
[19:22.56]250 versus 400.
[19:23.10]Here it comes.
[19:25.01]First battle.
[19:25.33]We're just going to check it out.
[19:31.99]Loading units.
[19:32.89]Oh, God.
[19:35.93]If I wasn't dropping frames before, I'll be dropping them now.
[19:41.86]Mostly rain with some sun.
[19:43.04]It's 7 p.m.
[19:47.63]By the way, how's the stream?
[19:51.23]I'm sure you'll be able to tell me.
[19:54.22]Thank you, Sir Jimmy Jammer.
[19:56.32]The battle starts at a soft 7pm.
[20:00.46]God, can my computer even handle this shit?
[20:07.06]It's going, apparently.
[20:08.26]Turn off the rain.
[20:09.12]Wait, the rain kills it?
[20:13.85]Well, we'll find out.
[20:23.69]Streams have been very eventful.
[20:24.73]Blame Comcast and their terrible fucking service.
[20:35.82]I mean, my CPU is, like, fine.
[20:37.00]I think the game might have just crashed because I did rain.
[20:40.14]Rain, like, actually does, like... Okay, it's early access, by the way.
[20:46.44]And there it is.
[20:48.24]Okay.
[20:49.91]Game crashed.
[20:55.79]When is fucking Congress gonna get involved and make this game work?
[21:04.77]Where's the Congress bill that's gonna make sure that this game works?
[21:11.49]You wonder why Congress has a fucking 6% approval rating.
[21:21.70]Do it again.
[21:22.20]No rain.
[21:23.66]Clear.
[21:25.82]Same deal.
[21:26.58]Start battle.
[21:31.10]Here we go.
[21:34.73]Here it comes.
[21:35.23]Okay, wait, here we go.
[21:36.87]Where are the units?
[21:39.39]I can move around the camera.
[21:40.21]Oh, there they are.
[21:40.97]Alright.
[21:41.45]So here are the orcs.
[21:44.27]And there are the footmen.
[21:45.99]So we're going to press K to start battle.
[21:48.63]We can move in a little faster here.
[21:49.79]I think we can move people around.
[21:50.71]Oh, God.
[21:51.41]I just closed.
[21:54.70]Alright.
[21:55.83]So here are our orcs.
[21:58.85]So to start the battle, I start the battle.
[22:04.61]So these guys are defending.
[22:05.59]Where are the attackers?
[22:09.32]Oh, here they come.
[22:09.84]Here they come.
[22:11.56]How about you?
[22:13.88]You fucking wanker.
[22:17.08]That's what they're all saying.
[22:19.30]So I can possess somebody?
[22:22.69]Why are these guys not doing anything?
[22:29.48]They're just, like, standing in a line here?
[22:31.40]Why are they not moving?
[22:36.11]They're all just piling in.
[22:37.23]This is just turning into... Okay, this is just turning into my CPU.
[22:39.99]I don't have the hyper-threading.
[22:42.23]One guy died.
[22:42.89]They're all so bunched up, they can't even... Who's gonna win this?
[22:52.86]This is a traffic jam.
[22:55.58]I'm gonna possess this guy.
[22:58.05]Oh, shit.
[22:58.67]We're, like, stuck in here.
[23:01.14]How do you, like, attack?
[23:05.06]Do I, like, what button do I press to attack?
[23:07.72]Left-clicking alt-tabs the game.
[23:13.13]Oh, shit.
[23:13.61]Okay, there we go.
[23:14.17]I don't even know who's gonna win this fight.
[23:18.29]I really don't.
[23:23.35]Oh man, do you have problems with your CPU?
[23:26.71]Get the hyper-threading!
[23:27.73]What the fuck?
[23:28.26]These guys aren't even being hyper-threaded!
[23:31.90]I'm working with a one core CPU right now.
[23:34.76]Why wouldn't they go that way and check out the other core?
[23:37.46]Or that way and free up a second core?
[23:39.18]We're just doing a single core right here.
[23:44.37]I told the orcs to defend?
[23:45.61]Yeah, but... I wonder who's gonna... Obviously the orcs are gonna lose.
[23:56.87]Alright, let's take control of this guy.
[24:06.78]That didn't do anything.
[24:12.74]Where is my controller?
[24:16.10]Why does it keep alt-tabbing?
[24:17.60]Okay, right-click to possess.
[24:24.31]How do I get this guy out of here?
[24:28.81]The game just turned off.
[24:35.53]We're going to have to do a better fight than this.
[24:36.95]Mostly Sunny.
[24:43.12]It's mostly Sunny.
[24:46.68]Am I controlling this guy?
[24:48.00]I don't know why alt-tabbing...
[24:53.99]Closes the game.
[24:56.45]It really shouldn't be.
[25:00.37]There's too many units here.
[25:01.41]Let's do like a 1v1 or something.
[25:09.67]How do I skip this?
[25:15.90]Cinematic mode on.
[25:17.54]Oh, there we go.
[25:18.02]Okay.
[25:18.74]Time scale.
[25:20.72]What does that mean?
[25:24.52]times two you can speed up time?
[25:31.59]that's actually kind of funny okay I think I have a general gist of how this game works
[25:54.65]So, we're gonna have a couple of teams here.
[25:56.59]We're gonna have... Let's get out of here.
[25:59.94]Avalanche Canyon.
[26:00.70]This looks good.
[26:02.46]So, up here, this is gonna be... It'll be 100.
[26:08.11]Rank shape... Rank shape, like... Okay, there we go.
[26:11.75]Let's do, like...
[26:17.56]3?
[26:17.98]4?
[26:20.02]Like 1.4.
[26:21.68]Or like 10.
[26:23.78]Yeah, we'll do that.
[26:26.14]We'll have... 1,000.
[26:27.31]On the top of the hill is going to be... And they're going to attack.
[26:32.33]Not hold position.
[26:35.53]Team 1.
[26:36.95]Not orcs.
[26:37.49]1,000 giant... No, not 1,000 giant ogres.
[26:40.05]That's not a good idea.
[26:42.39]We'll go with 100.
[26:42.83]No.
[26:42.93]10 giant ogres.
[26:48.97]Uh, footmen are kind of annoying.
[26:50.25]Let's just go with, like, spearmen.
[26:52.85]400 of those, it's fine.
[26:56.51]Uh, World War II U.S.
[26:57.92]soldier.
[26:58.94]Those guys are gonna be, like, here.
[27:02.12]Right there's fine.
[27:03.26]We'll do, we'll do, like, a thousand of those.
[27:07.62]And let's do ancient Greece.
[27:10.84]No.
[27:11.80]Fantasy.
[27:13.68]No.
[27:14.59]Uh, heroes.
[27:16.81]Chuck Norris.
[27:17.37]Okay, Chuck Norris.
[27:20.07]We're gonna do 50 Chuck Norrises.
[27:22.28]A Chuck Norris?
[27:23.20]Really Chuck Norris?
[27:26.50]Is this like 2004?
[27:27.44]So here the 50 Chuck Norrises will be over here.
[27:34.42]We're gonna put them in line formation 10.
[27:36.04]I want them to be like in a line.
[27:39.16]That sounds okay.
[27:42.09]Now let's go with, um... Animals.
[27:46.03]We'll just go with like 5,000 chickens.
[27:50.07]And they're gonna be like over here, like this way.
[27:56.67]Okay.
[27:57.27]No?
[27:57.65]Okay.
[27:57.87]5,000 chickens.
[27:59.61]Right there.
[28:01.45]Uh, clear.
[28:02.47]7pm.
[28:03.07]Avalanche cannon.
[28:06.85]And let's go.
[28:07.15]Let's see what happens.
[28:13.38]This computer's gonna freeze.
[28:14.64]Alright, here it comes.
[28:20.22]Where are they?
[28:20.60]Where the hell is everybody?
[28:30.51]Where is everybody?
[28:34.59]Do you see any fucking people?
[28:35.85]All I see is trees.
[28:41.72]Uh... Start by... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[28:49.63]Are these bugs?
[28:51.67]Oh no, these are chickens, these are the chickens, okay.
[28:53.37]So where the hell is everybody else?
[28:54.81]Oh shit!
[28:56.23]No, like the spearmen versus the chickens, this is not gonna work!
[29:01.57]Where the hell is everybody else?
[29:08.49]And where... There's 5,000 chickens.
[29:15.34]The chickens aren't actually gonna win.
[29:18.18]No, this is just stupid.
[29:23.72]Should I just take control of one of the chickens?
[29:26.83]Okay.
[29:31.33]What the fuck is that?
[29:33.89]Why is there smoke coming over here?
[29:39.15]This is not right.
[29:40.53]Wait, who's throwing rocks?
[29:42.11]Somebody's throwing rocks!
[29:46.91]Hold on a second, what?
[29:49.81]Why are there giant boulders falling down?
[29:55.86]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[29:58.52]Wait, wait, where are those coming from?
[30:02.80]This one guy's fighting a bunch of chickens.
[30:08.37]He's gonna die.
[30:09.19]He's dead.
[30:09.83]They got a kill.
[30:11.63]The chickens got one kill.
[30:13.71]No, they got more than that.
[30:14.63]Oh, shit.
[30:19.43]The chickens just white blood celled.
[30:23.16]These guys.
[30:26.54]Chickens win.
[30:31.82]What happened with the rest of the fight?
[30:38.14]Wasn't there like a thousand people?
[30:41.38]What the hell happened?
[30:46.08]What happened to Chuck Norris?
[30:51.68]Am I crazy?
[30:56.42]Did this not show up?
[30:57.40]I don't understand.
[31:05.33]Okay, well, here with the chickens and shit, you probably had too many units.
[31:08.29]No, no, you can have as many units as you possibly want.
[31:10.99]Try it again.
[31:13.69]Now they're all spawning inside of each other.
[31:19.35]Okay.
[31:20.79]Loading units.
[31:24.36]Alright, they're the spearmen again.
[31:26.68]Right?
[31:31.02]Where the hell is everybody else?
[31:38.85]What, like over here?
[31:41.83]Probably need to be in the canyon.
[31:42.85]I was under the assumption that they were all in the right spot.
[31:46.89]I don't even see anybody else.
[31:53.94]The spearmen's won, okay?
[31:58.24]You can't spawn them when they fall through and die immediately.
[32:00.88]Alright, well then here.
[32:02.04]Here we go.
[32:03.18]We'll do this.
[32:10.92]How's this sound?
[32:12.59]How's that?
[32:12.97]Let's go.
[32:20.59]Alright.
[32:21.57]There we go.
[32:23.75]Here are the chickens.
[32:28.27]Oh, this is going to be a fucking shit show.
[32:32.24]So there are the giant ogres.
[32:35.62]These guys have machine guns.
[32:44.84]Okay.
[32:46.42]So the guys with the machine guns...
[32:55.90]This is not fair.
[32:57.80]This is not fair at all.
[32:59.00]This has turned into a firecracker.
[33:02.22]Holy shit, these guys are still alive!
[33:03.62]These guys... Why is... Hold on, Chuck Norris is like invincible?
[33:17.73]Why the fuck is Chuck Norris invincible?
[33:19.37]That is so stupid.
[33:22.18]Chuck Norris just kicks and instantly kills people.
[33:26.45]I'm so glad we're reviving this meme from, like, 1998.
[33:29.55]They can't die, apparently.
[33:36.10]Oh, my God.
[33:37.36]Wait, here come some more soldiers.
[33:38.54]Here come the spearmen.
[33:41.60]But nobody can beat Chuck Norris, apparently.
[33:47.09]I'm gonna take control over Chuck Norris.
[33:51.09]I can't take control of anybody?
[33:52.01]Why not?
[33:57.92]Oh my god.
[33:58.70]Oh, they have meme armor.
[34:06.66]Alright.
[34:07.88]Alright.
[34:08.46]Alright.
[34:08.96]Okay.
[34:09.72]We get it.
[34:10.24]We get it.
[34:10.60]Chuck Norris is gonna win.
[34:11.74]We get it.
[34:15.99]How do I fight, though?
[34:18.39]That's the thing.
[34:18.85]I wanna, like, attack.
[34:25.65]Oh, that's how you do it.
[34:30.54]This is fucking... This is real dumb.
[34:33.09]Okay, we aren't using Chuck Norris anymore.
[34:42.69]That's for certain.
[34:43.81]Let's do unit customization.
[34:49.10]Attack speed.
[34:51.70]times 100 move speed times a thousand or times 99 okay times 10 health let's go with uh let's go let's go with 100 000. damage 33 that's fine uh let's see can I like can I do anything with him can I like change his uh
[35:22.14]Attack speed, movement speed.
[35:26.32]Okay, unit customize.
[35:27.68]How do I, like... Let's go, like, a million health.
[35:33.83]That's fine.
[35:34.35]Attack speed times 100 times 10.
[35:35.87]Can I make it bigger?
[35:43.45]I can't, like, change this at all?
[35:47.71]Okay, well, we're gonna have one...
[35:51.96]One custom.
[35:53.75]Tommy.
[35:54.77]No, not 250 of them.
[35:55.47]Okay, we're gonna get rid of these.
[36:03.59]Uh, no.
[36:04.11]No chickens.
[36:04.73]Nothing.
[36:07.60]None.
[36:08.18]None.
[36:09.36]None.
[36:10.66]None.
[36:11.24]Okay, here we go.
[36:12.74]We're gonna do one super tortoise.
[36:17.50]And I'm gonna do... Let's do a World War II U.S.
[36:19.55]soldier.
[36:21.86]Let's go with 50,000.
[36:24.56]Let's go with 50,000.
[36:26.48]Right here.
[36:26.82]Facing that way.
[36:27.58]That sounds good.
[36:28.12]Alright.
[36:28.34]That works.
[36:28.66]Okay.
[36:47.43]Is the stream lagging a little?
[36:48.45]Yes, it is.
[36:49.29]I'm having internet issues at the moment, which I deeply apologize for.
[36:53.67]My internet is screwed up at the moment.
[36:55.45]It just barely is allowing me to stream.
[36:58.38]And it's making me very angry.
[36:59.90]So I'm very sorry that this stream is going to be very laggy.
[37:02.30]I'm sorry.
[37:04.54]Alright, Tommy the Tortoise.
[37:06.95]He has a million health, right?
[37:09.99]Let's give him like another zero.
[37:15.13]Let's make sure that's correct.
[37:17.35]Save.
[37:17.77]Yeah.
[37:18.19]He's got 1, 2, 3.
[37:20.28]1, 2, 3.
[37:20.58]10 million health.
[37:22.70]Let's see if Tommy the Tortoise can withstand an onslaught.
[37:31.71]50,000 US troops.
[37:33.89]There they are.
[37:36.27]Versus one Tommy the Tortoise.
[37:39.57]There he is.
[37:41.13]Okay.
[37:41.71]Wait.
[37:42.37]What?
[37:43.24]Here comes the fight.
[37:44.24]In three... Oh, hold on.
[37:46.96]Three, two, one, action.
[37:54.43]Is he already dead?
[37:55.75]Oh my god, it's just a wave.
[37:59.08]Where is he?
[37:59.70]Oh god.
[38:05.88]He's not gonna be able to kill all these people?
[38:09.96]Where is he?
[38:10.70]This is gonna take all day.
[38:22.97]Oh, my God.
[38:24.00]Okay, what if he, like, carves... He's gonna carve a crop circle.
[38:30.32]Let's see where he goes.
[38:32.98]Watch him, like, draw a pentagram.
[38:40.54]How much health does he have left?
[38:44.11]Oh, boy.
[38:44.75]Starting to lag a little.
[38:48.49]He's just making his way slowly through.
[38:56.49]Okay, he's kind of just eating his way through.
[38:58.82]He's making his own maze.
[39:00.00]I don't know how long this is going to go on for.
[39:14.06]He's doing a pretty good job.
[39:19.66]Although, hold on, let's like... Whoa!
[39:23.43]Whoa!
[39:26.01]What did I just do?
[39:27.53]Hold on, I just did something.
[39:28.47]Okay, I did times two speed.
[39:33.97]Slow down, slow down, slow down, please.
[39:38.82]What is his end game goal here?
[39:41.47]He's going to make it out.
[39:42.21]Did he just want to leave?
[39:43.57]Alright, he made it out.
[39:49.99]Okay, I'm kind of sick of this one.
[39:55.94]Let's just see how much health he has.
[39:57.04]Let me possess him.
[40:02.98]Where did he go?
[40:03.68]There he is.
[40:04.04]Alright, let's possess him.
[40:07.90]He has so much health.
[40:11.17]Let's just run away and see what happens.
[40:15.95]Let's play hide and go seek.
[40:19.57]Come on, I can't climb up that.
[40:22.93]Oh god.
[40:26.79]Somebody is just doing a limit break in Final Fantasy.
[40:30.27]Alright, I made it away.
[40:30.97]I got away, I got away.
[40:31.57]Let's see if they chase me.
[40:37.13]Wow, that took three hours.
[40:38.15]It's 10 p.m.
[40:39.09]now.
[40:43.25]Did they all go?
[40:45.23]What if I, like, hide?
[40:46.01]Alright, let's see where they are.
[40:50.66]No, no, no, no, no.
[40:52.98]Don't go back.
[40:53.54]Don't go back.
[40:56.18]Oh, God.
[40:56.90]No, this is not what I wanted.
[40:58.08]Alright, get out of here.
[41:04.78]I'm doing a new one.
[41:07.03]It felt like three hours.
[41:09.97]Oh, is the stream dead?
[41:10.83]No, we're still going.
[41:12.58]We're still going.
[41:15.48]Unit customization.
[41:16.38]Okay, let's see what we have.
[41:24.16]No more US soldier.
[41:25.11]They're too crazy.
[41:26.85]Catapult.
[41:27.35]Okay, we'll do catapults.
[41:30.59]We got penguins too, don't we?
[41:35.52]Let's do a huge battle.
[41:38.16]I wonder if my computer can handle it.
[41:39.12]Let's get off this map.
[41:39.82]Let's go to the world of thieves.
[41:43.38]Start over here.
[41:44.12]We'll get rid of this.
[41:45.20]U.S.
[41:45.40]soldier?
[41:45.86]No.
[41:47.73]None.
[41:47.97]Okay.
[41:50.39]Animals.
[41:52.19]No.
[41:53.63]Okay.
[41:53.91]Golden knight.
[41:56.65]What's the golden knight stats?
[41:57.71]It must be something stupid.
[41:59.65]It's going to be like a thousand damage or something, right?
[42:03.19]Why is it not here?
[42:08.06]What the hell is a golden knight?
[42:10.66]Chicken versus Tommy.
[42:11.90]Do the joke.
[42:18.66]No more soldiers.
[42:19.70]Ancient Greece.
[42:22.14]Spartan.
[42:22.76]Alright, let's just do... Evil.
[42:25.72]We'll do zombies.
[42:27.46]We're gonna do... Oh, Christ.
[42:32.92]This might not be a good idea.
[42:34.00]A million zombies.
[42:44.11]This might be the end of my fucking computer.
[42:46.91]Team 2 is going to be trebuchets.
[42:53.86]Just catapults.
[43:00.34]This is where we die.
[43:01.52]This is where it ends.
[43:03.74]And by the way, we're doing 5,000 catapults.
[43:05.00]50,000 catapults.
[43:05.30]Good luck.
[43:15.08]Oh, no.
[43:18.94]Hundreds... Oh, God.
[43:24.16]Are we going to crash immediately?
[43:25.69]We may have.
[43:28.89]I'm not going to move.
[43:30.77]If I move, I think I'll break everything.
[43:31.91]Oh!
[43:32.25]Oh!
[43:35.07]Oh!
[43:35.85]Oh!
[43:37.75]Oh, my...
[43:44.26]Oh my god.
[43:45.59]Oh my god.
[43:46.93]Oh my god.
[43:47.51]Where are the catapults?
[43:50.79]Could I even spawn the catapults in?
[43:54.09]I don't think so.
[43:56.60]I can't tell.
[43:57.20]Where are they?
[43:59.84]Where are the catapults?
[44:05.07]It didn't say anybody won.
[44:13.50]I don't know.
[44:13.98]I don't understand.
[44:15.16]Where did the catapults go?
[44:17.72]Over here?
[44:25.17]I'm going so slow.
[44:29.97]Oh, is that them right there?
[44:32.09]Oh, that's up to a part of the grass.
[44:36.15]My computer's gonna break.
[44:37.28]My computer's gonna break.
[44:38.74]I'm at 4 FPS.
[44:40.58]I thought these were trees.
[44:43.89]These motherfuckers look like trees Oh god No It's not even- it's just a slideshow, you can't even tell what the fuck is going on
[45:10.79]Yeah, sorry, guys.
[45:11.69]I thought this was wood.
[45:12.99]I thought this was just twigs on the ground.
[45:16.23]Put it in slow motion.
[45:19.25]And that was fast motion.
[45:25.31]I gotta turn it off fast motion.
[45:28.75]Oh, shit.
[45:30.03]No, no, no.
[45:30.61]Open this back up, please.
[45:35.50]I'm gonna go 0.5.
[45:38.16]See if that helps.
[45:43.16]No, this is not going to work.
[45:51.89]Remaining.
[45:53.91]88,000.
[45:54.09]How did a catapult die?
[45:57.81]That's what I want to know.
[45:59.47]Notice me how a fucking catapult actually died there.
[46:03.77]It is running.
[46:04.19]It is actually running.
[46:04.93]I'm going to possess this.
[46:16.29]I got to get me out of here.
[46:18.52]Before my... Oh, no.
[46:20.22]I think... Did we die?
[46:21.42]Did the stream lose?
[46:22.10]Did we lose the stream?
[46:26.32]The stream went down there for a second.
[46:31.12]I think stream might be going down, guys.
[46:34.54]Comcast is striking again.
[46:35.70]This might be the end.
[46:41.14]It just turned down to 0k up for me.
[46:47.06]Ugh, what a pain in the ass.
[46:49.34]Honest to God.
[46:49.92]That's so irritating, man.
[46:54.06]It really is.
[46:54.54]Like, can I just get, like, three months straight, or, like, two months straight without, like, my internet, like, having my upload just tanking for, like, two weeks in a row?
[47:10.33]I don't understand.
[47:16.73]It is not my computer that is causing those problems, by the way.
[47:20.13]I have dropped 18,000 frames because Comcast is a piece of shit company.
[47:27.62]And they suck at everything they do.
[47:31.34]There's literally not one thing that Comcast does that is worth talking about.
[47:35.25]They suck.
[47:38.29]If you can avoid it, don't ever fucking buy it.
[47:41.57]If you can't avoid it.
[47:44.79]So, there you go.
[47:46.43]There's my product review.
[47:52.18]Complaining to Comcast gives them sexual pleasure.
[47:54.87]Oh, God.
[47:57.29]But thank you, Never Trust Purple, for the ten bucks.
[48:00.07]Sir, there's a massive force crushing down on us.
[48:01.77]We need to retreat immediately.
[48:02.91]Nah, that's an army.
[48:03.77]No, that's not an army.
[48:05.35]That's grass.
[48:09.27]Oh, thanks for the ten bucks, dude.
[48:11.21]Also, thank you, Duke Nukem, for the two bucks.
[48:12.87]Tommy is my lord and savior.
[48:15.08]All... Oh, God.
[48:16.02]Tommy.
[48:16.84]The tortoise.
[48:17.34]Well, thank you, Duke Nukem.
[48:18.64]All hail Tommy.
[48:21.84]The tortoise.
[48:23.77]Sir Jimmy Jammer, thank you for the 10 bucks.
[48:25.47]Tommy Turtle for the next Turbo Rumble.
[48:26.97]Well, maybe that's a good character to pick for sure.
[48:30.68]Thank you.
[48:32.52]Jeebus, thanks for the 5 bucks.
[48:35.14]Have 535 members of Congress versus one angry streamer.
[48:38.14]Good idea.
[48:41.34]Thank you, dude.

[48:46.90]Been watching since your tactical intervention video years ago.

[48:51.96]That is one of my favorite videos ever.
[48:54.52]So, I'm glad that's the one that you watched from.
[48:57.38]So, thank you.
[48:58.84]And thank you for the $10.
[49:01.79]Also, SirJimmyJammer gave $10 saying, Hey, have you ever thought about playing Choice Chamber?
[49:05.31]I have.
[49:06.63]But I have never played it.
[49:07.45]Maybe we'll check it out.
[49:09.43]Maybe.
[49:10.37]Maybe.
[49:12.17]But yeah, we're going to keep going.
[49:13.31]We're going to try some more things.
[49:14.88]And I'm going to hang up the phone.
[49:17.96]No, not hang up.
[49:18.56]I'm going to call Comcast.
[49:19.20]Comcast.
[49:21.40]And be like, dude, my upload just went up to like 6,000 right there.
[49:25.23]Like, what the fuck is going on?
[49:26.29]Alright, let's try to do an actual battle.
[49:33.66]None of this funny shit.
[49:35.44]No more funny shit.
[49:36.58]We can end on, like, funny shit.
[49:42.76]Okay, let's go with...
[49:46.00]Heroes.
[49:47.10]No.
[49:48.92]Medieval.
[49:50.40]Let's just go with some footmen.
[49:52.96]Over here.
[49:54.74]I wish I could have more people on the same team.
[49:57.88]I guess I can, right?
[49:58.56]Team 1.
[49:58.88]Yeah, okay.
[50:01.40]Medieval.
[50:01.88]I will have one golden knight inside the base here.
[50:06.14]Let's do footmen.
[50:11.57]We're going to have one golden knight on each side.
[50:16.65]I wish you would spin this way It's like in here right there.
[50:22.36]Can I zoom in good?
[50:26.32]Okay, so he's gonna be in the front door Yeah, he'll be this is like the boss so he'll be right here I'll be standing behind Yeah, the last group of footmen
[50:44.41]Remember, this is the Golden Knight.
[50:45.39]This guy is fucking hard.
[50:49.37]And then, up here, we're going to have some archers.
[50:52.78]250 is okay there.
[50:53.26]Team 1.
[50:53.44]We're going to stay up in Medieval.
[50:57.82]We're going to have archers.
[51:01.40]And they will be up here.
[51:05.34]Can they be standing anywhere?
[51:08.11]They'll just be right here shooting.
[51:13.93]And we're going to give them a better formation than this.
[51:16.61]Give them like... I'm going to have to get rid of some of these.
[51:19.35]Let's go with 200.
[51:20.93]No, let's go with 100.
[51:26.27]Two.
[51:26.75]That works.
[51:27.17]Okay.
[51:28.15]There we go.
[51:28.91]So when they come up the hill here, I'm going to have to deal with some archers.
[51:32.47]We're doing a real battle.
[51:33.25]This is a real battle.
[51:37.18]Same thing.
[51:37.70]Medieval.
[51:39.68]This is team one.
[51:41.86]This is the meat and potatoes.
[51:44.54]We're gonna have heavy knights.
[51:46.98]This is the meat and potato crew.
[51:50.83]And we want a thousand of these guys.
[51:57.59]And these guys are on defense.
[51:58.73]I gotta change this to defense.
[52:02.13]So these guys are gonna be right here.
[52:04.73]Waiting.
[52:05.75]Meat and potatoes.
[52:08.44]And that's fine.
[52:09.10]They're all on hold position.
[52:10.82]These guys can attack.
[52:11.48]No, no.
[52:12.46]Hold position.
[52:12.76]Hold position.
[52:14.63]Hold position on the Archers.
[52:15.75]Hold position on the... On the Green Knight.
[52:19.15]Everybody hold position.
[52:21.73]Except you guys can attack.
[52:22.63]That's fine.
[52:25.43]Team 2, on the other hand... Is going to have... We're going to go with... Ancient Greece.
[52:31.84]Romans.
[52:32.96]No.
[52:34.52]Fantasy.
[52:37.16]We're going to go with Orcs.
[52:38.77]So there are way more orcs, right?
[52:40.85]Because that's how it always is in every single video game.
[52:43.77]The orcs always have like a fucking hundred million people.
[52:48.31]So we'll go with 10,000 orcs.
[52:50.80]Team 2.
[52:52.46]And these, obviously, they're attacking.
[52:56.22]Same deal.
[52:56.82]Fantasy.
[52:58.22]Orcs.
[52:59.42]We need giant ogres.
[53:01.60]They're going to be like back here.
[53:03.08]And we're going to do 500 giant ogres.
[53:07.90]And they get a hero, too.
[53:08.98]They get, uh... They get Chuck Norris!
[53:14.26]Where?
[53:15.22]No, they don't get Chuck Norris.
[53:16.25]Fuck that.
[53:18.85]No.
[53:19.95]Nobody gets Chuck Norris.
[53:20.97]That's stupid.
[53:23.31]Fantasy would go with, uh... Now we'll do... Instead of orcs.
[53:27.75]Yeah.
[53:30.27]And they get some penguins, too.
[53:31.97]Right?
[53:32.23]You know what?
[53:32.59]Might as well.
[53:32.91]And they're gonna come... They're gonna flank from the other side.
[53:34.75]That's what the Uragas don't understand.
[53:37.24]So, like... Five... Let's go with, like... Let's go with, like, 3,000.
[53:43.18]3,000 penguins are gonna flank from this side.
[53:47.26]You guys didn't even know.
[53:50.39]Okay.
[53:52.99]This looks like a pretty good battle.
[53:55.33]I think I like this.
[53:55.83]You know, we're gonna hold position on here.
[53:58.03]So, these guys are the defenders, and here come the attackers.
[54:03.40]I think I'm ready.
[54:05.28]This looks pretty good, right?
[54:09.56]Make them team two.
[54:10.70]That's right, team two.
[54:13.28]Team two, team two, team two.
[54:16.50]Team one, team two, team two, team two.
[54:19.72]Okay.
[54:21.22]And then this is going to be a team three.
[54:23.94]Team three is going to be... One U.S.
[54:33.33]soldier.
[54:35.05]He's like gonna fucking sit in like the trenches, you know what I mean?
[54:37.66]Like one US soldier just got teleport time traveled here.
[54:42.38]He's gonna be over there.
[54:44.12]He's team three.
[54:45.34]You guys ready?
[54:47.54]I'm ready.
[54:49.24]Three, two, one.
[54:51.08]Let's begin the battle.
[54:53.84]No, not Tommy.
[54:54.36]Tommy will fuck the whole thing up.
[55:01.07]No warlocks.
[55:05.36]Let's make sure everybody's in the right place.
[55:08.58]That's very important.
[55:12.26]Loading units.
[55:14.14]Okay, there we go.
[55:15.12]They're loading over there.
[55:17.08]Got our archers.
[55:18.67]And there's the king.
[55:19.25]Remember, the goal is to kill the king.
[55:25.07]He's got his units here protecting.
[55:26.35]Oh, they're all holding.
[55:28.51]There are the archers when they come up the hill here.
[55:30.49]They're going to be bombarded by the archers.
[55:35.43]And then they have this to deal with as well.
[55:36.87]These are the meat and potatoes, the heavy knights.
[55:41.21]Moving over here, we have, obviously... I don't even know where he is.
[55:47.05]He's so far away.
[55:47.85]Alright, whose perspective do we want to watch this from?
[55:52.35]Like, one guy with a machine gun?
[55:55.43]I love how he's like, oh, this is gonna be so great.
[55:59.21]I'm so ready for this.
[56:01.83]Okay, I think we're ready.
[56:05.98]Let me make sure the other guys have their ogres.
[56:10.19]Team 2 wins so easy, the numbers are too much.
[56:14.53]And again, yes, I'm sorry for dropping these frames.
[56:16.67]I'm so sorry, guys.
[56:18.64]There's just nothing.
[56:19.22]If you just got to the stream, I'm so sorry.
[56:22.12]I'm having internet issues at the moment.
[56:23.56]And there are a fucking lot of these guys.
[56:26.50]Might have skewed... But they have to go through, like... Defense always wins.
[56:30.37]Don't you guys know that?
[56:33.96]These guys have to go through water, they have to deal with the random guy with the machine gun.
[56:38.54]Start battle.
[56:39.62]Here it goes.
[56:42.06]Here they go.
[56:42.46]They're not gonna just drown in the water, are they?
[56:50.35]I love how like fucking a thousand of them are going to fight the one soldier.
[56:56.35]Is that actually happening?
[56:57.99]We gotta get that one fucking guy over here.
[57:00.13]Where did he go?
[57:02.01]Where's the soldier?
[57:04.99]Oh, God.
[57:05.43]I lost track of the soldier.
[57:09.25]Oh, there he is.
[57:09.93]He's just like shooting.
[57:13.65]Oh, you dick.
[57:17.05]Look, he doesn't even know.
[57:19.17]This one soldier has no idea that like 5,000 units are coming after him.
[57:31.50]Are they... Where are they?
[57:33.96]Is he just gonna be able to do that the whole time?
[57:35.54]Alright, here we go!
[57:39.11]Here we go!
[57:40.73]Here comes the first battle!
[57:43.35]They just have to make their way up here.
[57:44.63]What do you mean they're drowning?
[57:49.81]Are they drowning in here?
[57:52.73]What the fuck are you guys doing?
[57:56.41]Turn right!
[57:59.19]Why did one guy turn right?
[58:03.23]You can't be this dumb.
[58:05.39]You don't understand how to go up.
[58:06.89]You think you just want to run straight through here.
[58:13.61]The soldier died.
[58:14.69]They're just slowly wrapping.
[58:20.04]I figured it out, guys.
[58:20.98]You have to walk on the path.
[58:22.68]Isn't that interesting?
[58:23.58]I figured it out.
[58:25.00]Die.
[58:25.60]Ow.
[58:33.36]Yeah, one guy.
[58:34.62]No, no, two guys figured it out.
[58:37.90]They're coming up one by fucking one.
[58:44.02]The soldier's dead.
[58:45.47]The soldier didn't kill anybody.
[58:47.43]Here come the archers.
[58:50.25]Oh dear.
[58:57.97]Where are these people going?
[59:03.39]Alright, let's speed this up.
[59:06.57]Times two.
[59:11.82]Oh my god, you fucking idiots.
[59:16.16]They can't even figure it out.
[59:24.62]Check on the soldier, the soldier's dead.
[59:28.56]The soldier was just aiming over here and shooting and he got swarmed by 500 orcs.
[59:31.89]Where are the penguins?
[59:35.23]Where are the penguins?
[59:36.31]Where are the penguins?
[59:37.99]Where are the penguins?
[59:40.73]Where are the penguins?
[59:43.53]Oh my god, what happened?
[59:44.53]Hold on.
[59:44.85]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[59:47.57]Where'd they go?
[59:54.47]Why can you guys not figure this out?
[59:59.07]Oh, no.
[60:00.88]They're gonna get in the... Alright.
[60:02.68]Ladies and gentlemen.
[60:04.54]The penguins are smarter than the orcs.
[60:07.78]They like flanking.
[60:14.70]It's so dark, too.
[60:16.00]Mostly sunny, huh?
[60:21.99]Yeah.
[60:22.97]That's so fucking funny.
[60:26.25]And somehow they're making their way in.
[60:29.86]Well, congratulations guys.
[60:32.09]Nice work.
[61:08.77]This is the real battle.
[61:20.17]Have the orcs figured out how to get in here yet?
[61:22.91]Oh, they did, they did, they figured it out, they figured it out.
[61:29.96]It's finally getting to be sunny outside.
[61:31.62]Oh my god.
[61:37.44]Oh man, this is not going to be good.
[61:39.06]Wait, what about the Golden Knight?
[61:42.16]Forget about the distraction of penguins.
[61:43.94]I just don't do anything.
[61:44.95]I just walk up here and die.
[61:51.01]Look at how many bodies are just collecting right here.
[61:56.88]One penguin got a hit.
[61:59.24]One penguin...
[62:03.96]That's so funny to me that the first penguin that got up here just bit the shit out of this guy.
[62:15.18]Get him!
[62:15.50]Come on!
[62:15.82]Please bite him!
[62:16.94]Bite him!
[62:23.70]This is so fucking horrible.
[62:26.26]There's only two of us.
[62:29.42]There's only twelve of us.
[62:38.78]It's alright.
[62:39.22]The king is safe!
[62:40.00]This is so dumb.
[62:45.76]The penguins are the worst.
[62:46.82]How is this going?
[62:50.61]Look at these cockroaches.
[62:54.81]This shit is still going on.
[62:58.61]How are they still fighting?
[63:05.22]All they did, all they did is they just made Louisiana.
[63:07.84]That's all they did.
[63:10.46]They carefully crafted Louisiana.
[63:14.75]Good work.
[63:18.13]Here comes the march of penguins.
[63:26.32]Oh my god.
[63:33.31]Why do they slow?
[63:34.03]Alright, I'm taking control.
[63:35.95]Fuck this.
[63:37.79]I'm taking control of one of these guys and I'm going right for the fucking king.
[63:42.07]Just go for the king.
[63:45.38]I'm just gonna sneak around and just stab the king.
[63:47.68]Just like in Game of Thrones, that's how you do it.
[63:49.24]In Game of Thrones, I wouldn't even fight.
[63:58.26]Fuck.
[64:00.85]Oh my god, they're making progress.
[64:01.91]They're actually making progress.
[64:05.58]Holy shit, guys.
[64:07.60]All it took was thousands of them.
[64:09.00]The archers are so weak.
[64:11.10]They're so weak.
[64:17.18]Oh, come on, come on.
[64:19.42]Get up there.
[64:22.74]Get up there.
[64:23.30]How are we doing over here?
[64:35.72]This is where it's going to get real bad here.
[64:37.92]These guys finally made it up.
[64:40.38]These gigantic fucking guys made it up here.
[64:45.78]This is where it ends.
[64:46.48]This is where it ends.
[64:51.12]Yep.
[64:52.02]Oh, dear.
[64:52.78]Let's take control of one of these guys.
[64:58.47]Oh, God.
[64:58.87]My game just fucking crashed.
[65:00.77]We're okay.
[65:03.13]Get off him.
[65:03.51]Get off him.
[65:03.81]No.
[65:03.89]No.
[65:05.63]They're gonna get through this very, very quickly.
[65:07.35]There's so many of them left.
[65:11.73]We're getting really clo- Okay, alright, we got another penguin breach.
[65:25.66]The penguins are actually doing work.
[65:29.51]Uh...
[65:38.18]They're gonna make it in, they're breaching It's alright, the king, the fucking golden king is still alive We might have to barricade ourselves in here Come on How many penguins were there, by the way?
[65:59.91]They're not even showing up on the map
[66:06.15]Oh, no.
[66:06.69]Big guy got him.
[66:08.33]He might be too stupid to figure out where to go.
[66:11.29]Yeah, he thinks he's a little too dumb.
[66:12.53]Yeah, they're gonna start piling in.
[66:13.87]I gotta protect the fucking king.
[66:17.20]I don't think it's that way.
[66:19.06]Oh, God.
[66:23.06]3,000 of them?
[66:33.60]Oh, by the way, like, I need to ask.
[66:36.63]How laggy has the stream been?
[66:38.53]Like, has it been, like, un-fucking-bearable because of the Comcast bullshit?
[66:41.17]Because I'm looking over and I see, like, a ton of dropped frames.
[66:43.85]It's not be- Hold on, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.
[66:46.75]Get in there.
[66:48.33]Get in there!
[66:53.14]Oh, shit's about to get real.
[66:55.02]Shit's about to get real.
[66:57.80]I gotta roleplay as the king.
[67:00.04]Oh, no, they figured it out.
[67:06.06]It's horrible.
[67:06.82]I fucking hate Comcast.
[67:09.59]This is like fun too.
[67:11.41]Like what the fuck?
[67:13.03]Alright, time to play as the king.
[67:14.03]This is just like in that fucking Lord of the Rings movie.
[67:22.06]Alright, defend your king.
[67:30.95]freezes every minute.
[67:33.37]It's getting worse too.
[67:34.91]I can look over and see my bitrate is just dying.
[67:39.79]Wouldn't you like to watch a stream, guys?
[67:41.58]Instead of having Comcast suck asshole?
[67:43.86]I'm going to make up for this.
[67:45.54]Here we go.
[67:45.78]Come on.
[67:48.06]Here we go.
[67:50.00]Fucking game crashed.
[67:52.52]No, it didn't.
[67:54.46]The game is dead.
[68:02.95]Okay, the king's dead.
[68:03.87]That's it.
[68:09.80]That's it.
[68:10.30]King died.
[68:11.50]In two fucking seconds.
[68:16.30]Alright.
[68:21.44]I think, uh, I... I gotta have to call the stream.
[68:25.19]I'm sorry, guys.
[68:26.13]It's just... There's nothing I can do.
[68:29.01]I thought maybe if I gave it like an hour or so, it would fix itself.
[68:34.27]I figured maybe if I gave it like an hour, it would work.
[68:38.79]But I'm so sorry that something's going on with my internet.
[68:42.25]Like usual, like every like three months, Comcast decides that my upload just doesn't work anymore.
[68:48.93]I'm looking over right here and I'm seeing 26,000 dropped frames.
[68:54.71]21% of every frame was dropped.
[68:55.83]That means that like every three seconds, that means every four seconds the game like froze.
[69:10.22]We'll do this for a little bit longer, but, like, I can't, like... I can't, in, like, good conscience, continue streaming at, like, a 20% frame drop.
[69:21.91]Just because, like, that just sucks.
[69:23.09]It's not, like... That's not cool.
[69:28.85]It is not because of the game.
[69:30.87]It is because of my internet.
[69:31.85]I'm looking over at it right now.
[69:34.42]My CPU is only at, like, 48% or so.
[69:38.66]Right now, just sitting at this screen, I'm going down to, like, 2,000 up.
[69:45.08]Like, 1,500 up.
[69:47.78]100 up.
[69:48.78]It's just all over the place.
[69:51.76]Uh... Yeah, I think... Yeah, I'm sorry, guys.
[69:58.12]I wish there was something I could fucking do, but there's just nothing I can do.
[70:02.41]There is nothing I can do.
[70:05.29]One final boss battle.
[70:06.29]Alright, I'll do one, one final boss battle and then I gotta get out of here.
[70:10.93]Cause this is just like, this is like sincerely pissing me off.
[70:15.41]It's like, Comcast fucking business internet is like $125 a month.
[70:20.18]It's like, what the fuck?
[70:25.30]Like imagine if I was like a fucking actual like corporation that needed to use the internet.
[70:29.67]And like I couldn't, like customers couldn't get to my fucking website or something.
[70:36.32]It's just annoying.
[70:37.94]It's really annoying that this shit happens, like, every, like, two or three months.
[70:43.09]Every couple months, my internet's not gonna work for, like, fucking a week straight.
[70:47.09]That's really, really irritating.
[70:49.91]I'm sorry, guys.
[70:52.55]And I'll do one more boss battle, and after that, I have to call it and see if I can call Comcast and see what's going on.
[70:59.28]Because even, like, right now, like, even while I'm just sitting on the screen, am I dropping frames right here?
[71:05.44]Like, is it like every couple seconds?
[71:13.31]Annoying as hell.
[71:22.69]Looks fine.
[71:27.21]Now it's fine now?
[71:28.99]Uh, I don't know.
[71:30.73]I'm seeing like, I'm seeing the fucking red meter.
[71:33.37]It's like red, red, red, red.
[71:36.74]I can't change my ISP, unfortunately.
[71:39.81]I cannot change ISPs.
[71:41.83]I'm stuck with Comcast forever.
[71:48.73]Facecam frames are great.
[71:54.05]Well, here we go.
[71:55.47]Let's do another boss battle.
[71:58.07]I just dropped a few.
[72:00.21]I don't want it to be the fucking stream, you know?
[72:04.42]Restart the modem?
[72:05.12]That's not gonna do anything for me, man.
[72:06.78]I can promise you that.
[72:08.30]This is an issue that's persisting over the last, like, year.
[72:13.08]This is a problem that I've had to deal with, like, four times now.
[72:16.99]Like, every couple months.
[72:18.13]It's just so fucking aggravating.
[72:20.65]And I could be a broken record and keep saying that, but... You guys know me.
[72:24.25]I say the same thing.
[72:25.55]I repeat myself, like, 30 fucking times when I'm mad about something.
[72:28.25]I'm not sure if you guys realize that.
[72:30.09]If I'm angry with something, I just say it, like, nine times to, like, reiterate it to myself how angry I am.
[72:38.77]But let's do another boss battle.
[72:39.79]I'm gonna dip out of the facecam.
[72:44.09]Call Comcast on stream.
[72:48.28]I would.
[72:49.60]But, like, I don't think I can do that.
[72:51.74]Let me just say hello to some people that gave some cash.
[72:55.30]Some people gave money.
[72:56.06]I wanna say hello to those people.
[73:00.45]Stix Renegade gave another $5.
[73:01.89]There's no Verizon Fios or anything in Mass.
[73:03.87]No.
[73:04.95]No Stix, there is not.
[73:06.31]There is Fios in Massachusetts, but not in this area.
[73:10.72]Yeah, it's actually very rare to actually be able to get Fios.
[73:13.46]I would pay three times more money to get Fios, though.
[73:16.74]Because it's fucking, like, 30... Like, the base package for Fios... The basic dogshit base package is, like, five times faster than my, like, Comcast business package.
[73:30.65]That's, like, the fucking ludicrousness of Comcast.
[73:36.74]But, thanks a lot, Sticks.
[73:37.76]He also gave 10 bucks as well.
[73:38.92]He said, I think we'd rather deal with the lag than for you to call it.
[73:42.62]Yeah, but it's just a personal thing for me, you know?
[73:45.06]Like, I want my stream's, like, quality to be good.
[73:47.00]I don't want it to have to fucking deal with, like... Because think about people that just come into the stream.
[73:51.52]Let's figure it, right?
[73:53.15]That's a possibility.
[73:54.89]And random-ass people coming in and, like, being like, Oh, this stream sucks!
[74:00.36]Like, fuck, this guy's stream quality is fucking terrible.
[74:02.98]I want a good stream.
[74:04.92]And if I can't do that, then I don't want to do it.
[74:08.28]That's just how I feel.
[74:09.42]Alright, we're going to do a boss battle here.
[74:12.14]We're going to do... I want to play this game more, though.
[74:16.87]We're going to do one super animal versus one super... Let's see.
[74:22.37]Let's just do a super animal fight.
[74:24.65]It's going to be 5v5.
[74:32.90]They think you suck anyways.
[74:37.98]Coming from the guy that did the comb stream.
[74:39.74]No, but that was like a joke.
[74:42.17]That was a joke stream.
[74:42.99]And I dare you talk about how bad the comb stream was.
[74:45.41]That's one of my best streams.
[74:48.85]Alright, let's do... Let's go make a custom unit.
[74:52.85]This is gonna have... I don't even know how much that is.
[74:58.17]But don't worry.
[74:58.69]They're gonna do a ton of damage.
[75:05.63]Holy shit.
[75:16.19]Okay, we're gonna do... We'll have Tommy 2.
[75:22.50]Tommy 2.0.
[75:22.88]Tommy 2.0.
[75:23.22]No, he needs to have more health than that.
[75:38.22]Okay.
[75:40.66]Save unit.
[75:41.12]Tommy 2.0.
[75:44.04]Versus the ever formidable.
[75:45.92]So let's get custom in here.
[75:47.44]Custom.
[76:00.13]What the fuck?
[76:01.55]Can I not do that?
[76:13.39]I don't get it.
[76:20.47]Is he too out of control?
[76:21.59]Where's Tommy Two Point?
[76:24.09]Where's Tommy Two Point?
[76:39.12]Custom Tommy... Is the name too long?
[76:43.87]Hey, Sneegill, thank you for the $50.
[76:46.35]jermaSlug.
[76:48.79]Thank you, Sneegill, for the 50 fucking bucks.
[76:53.59]Tell me two.
[76:58.90]That's very, very, very generous of you, dude.
[77:01.58]$50 from Sneegill.
[77:04.38]With the jermaSlug emote, thank you.
[77:07.52]Tell me two.
[77:08.00]What?
[77:13.29]What the fuck?
[77:15.07]Tommy!
[77:16.11]Save him.
[77:17.27]Load selected.
[77:17.97]Tommy.
[77:19.11]Load him.
[77:19.41]10.
[77:27.97]Okay.
[77:34.66]Save unit.
[77:35.50]Save Tommy.
[77:37.30]Okay, so Tommy.
[77:38.24]That has to be Tommy now, right?
[77:41.88]Unit customization.
[77:42.70]Tommy.
[77:43.12]See?
[77:43.62]What the fuck was that?
[77:47.91]Tommy versus Timmy.
[77:50.31]The only difference is Timmy is... Timmy's a penguin.
[78:00.64]I don't even know.
[78:01.78]He might have more health.
[78:03.40]That's kind of not fair.
[78:05.36]Save unit.
[78:05.92]Timmy.
[78:09.16]Tommy.
[78:09.86]What the fuck?
[78:13.27]Why can I not- I don't understand this.
[78:16.83]Custom.
[78:19.21]Only Tommy is allowed.
[78:20.91]I can't do Timmy.
[78:25.57]Save unit.
[78:26.32]Save Timmy.
[78:29.70]Can I only have one fucking person?
[78:35.74]I can only have Tommy.
[78:36.48]It's gonna be Tommy versus Tommy.
[78:39.72]Good.
[78:40.36]Tommy versus Tommy.
[78:42.59]The boss battle.
[78:44.77]There we go.
[78:46.25]What else am I supposed to do?
[78:49.31]I'm just going to go here.
[78:54.89]Load selected.
[78:57.23]Load selected.
[78:58.21]He's not there.
[78:59.27]None.
[79:01.04]Save Timmy.
[79:04.38]No.
[79:10.50]I can only have Tommy.
[79:16.60]Fuck it, whatever.
[79:21.38]This is the last.
[79:22.18]This is the fucking... This is the one for the books.
[79:27.09]How are we even going to be able to tell who's on what team?
[79:30.71]They're just spawning on top of each other?
[79:32.73]No, they could be down here.
[79:35.99]Here's your boss battle.
[79:40.94]Overflow on health.
[79:44.88]Let's do nine health.
[79:47.15]Okay, there we go.
[79:48.33]So 999.
[79:50.65]Save.
[79:52.43]How much health can they have?
[79:53.47]Alright, Timby.
[80:03.22]Timby.
[80:03.58]Alright, so Timby, Timby, and Tommy.
[80:10.79]Alright, okay, I got Timby.
[80:12.77]That works.
[80:16.79]Alright, it's Timby vs. Tombi.
[80:20.54]Why are they so much bigger?
[80:25.46]Okay, Tombi vs. Timby.
[80:28.24]Let's go.
[80:39.10]Probably not more than 4 million.
[80:44.36]This might actually break my computer.
[80:45.90]Times 9999999 speed.
[80:50.91]Christ.
[80:52.53]Well, this might be the one to end it.
[80:54.03]Here we go.
[81:16.43]Why are they not attacking?
[81:36.28]Hold on, they're on fucking home position.
[81:40.42]They're on hold position.
[81:43.94]Game just like crap.
[81:44.86]Alright attack attack They don't do any fucking damage.
[81:49.85]We're good.
[81:50.07]They gotta do more than that.
[81:50.99]Alright, Timmy load selected damage 5,000 save And then Tim be a fuck with Tommy Tim be Tommy Tommy Will do Set 8,000 damage no 10,000 damage.
[82:10.94]Oh
[82:14.47]So that's Tommy and then we need Timby.
[82:18.35]Attack speed multiplier is going to be way higher than that.
[82:20.39]That's not fair.
[82:22.91]Save.
[82:24.81]Okay.
[82:25.11]Load selected.
[82:25.81]Timmy.
[82:28.91]He's got to do 5,000 damage.
[82:31.90]Save Timby.
[82:33.34]Okay.
[82:33.82]Now let's go back to Tommy.
[82:36.10]Looks good.
[82:36.88]Because they get 40,000 damage.
[82:37.80]Okay.
[82:37.96]Okay.
[82:44.38]Let's do it.
[82:56.47]Oh, God.
[82:57.15]My stream just died.
[82:58.01]Are we still live?
[82:59.15]I went down to 0k up right there.
[83:01.23]Are we actually still live?
[83:04.59]I don't know.
[83:06.11]I hope so.
[83:07.31]Here we go.
[83:09.40]Oh, God.
[83:22.43]I don't think anyone's gonna die.
[83:23.87]I'm just shaking.
[83:33.01]Oh, wait, wait, the Timbys.
[83:34.07]The Timbys have killed people.
[83:37.44]There are deaths.
[83:50.42]Oh, my God.
[83:51.20]Okay.
[83:52.04]Well, looks like the Timbies win.
[83:57.58]What does it look like from far away?
[84:03.35]We just made, like... We just made one of those half-moon desserts, except the person that made it had, like, a Bloody Finger.
[84:13.81]Yeah.
[84:14.90]The baker that made this half-moon cut his finger and didn't even give a shit.
[84:19.08]He still left it up on the rack.
[84:29.17]Ying and Yang.
[84:30.71]It does look like a Ying and Yang symbol.
[84:32.66]Yeah.
[84:33.74]Or one of those half moons.
[84:41.48]Well, I don't want to sit here for another three hours.
[84:43.46]Oh, wait.
[84:44.70]The Tommy's got four kills.
[84:45.80]Who cares?
[84:52.79]Who cares?
[84:55.09]I'm going to exit the game.
[84:56.97]I want to just make sure something important.
[84:59.13]Let's exit.
[85:01.87]And turn that off.
[85:04.39]So I'm not capping any game right now.
[85:08.76]The game capture is literally turned off.
[85:11.76]And as you can see, we are still dropping a shitload of frames.
[85:14.74]The game is not the problem.
[85:17.27]I'm at a very low upload right now.
[85:21.82]So even with the game turned off, I'm sorry.
[85:23.98]Unfortunately, this shit still sucks.
[85:36.83]Time for a magic show?
[85:39.23]Oh, God.
[85:40.43]No, not right now.
[85:45.60]um yeah I I don't want to have I I'm sorry guys I'm going to try to figure this out before tomorrow um at least I could stream for an hour and a half but seriously I don't want to have it be like oh at least I could stream for an hour and a half seriously god I I want to say so many awful things right now I just want to like scream swears and like yell
[86:16.40]Fucking Comcast, man.
[86:17.40]I swear to God.
[86:19.08]It's so funny because some guy called me.
[86:21.16]Some dude from Comcast fucking called my cell phone.
[86:23.62]It was like, oh, hi, Mr. Harrington.
[86:26.28]Now I'm dropping my comb.
[86:27.39]I'm fucking that upset.
[86:28.73]Oh, excuse me, Mr. Harrington.
[86:30.91]Yes, this is my... Oh, let me just tell you.
[86:32.77]I am one of the employees that is dedicated to your case.
[86:36.65]I'm so dedicated to this.
[86:37.93]Please.
[86:38.61]We're going to be like... Our plant's going to be monitoring your situation.
[86:41.90]It's like, okay, great.
[86:44.06]Thanks, dude.
[86:47.14]Like, what happened now?
[86:48.20]I'm gonna call this guy and he's gonna be like, oh, well, oh, so we're so sorry about this, Mr. Harrington.
[86:52.66]Let me look into this for you.
[86:53.62]And he's gonna hang up and be like, this guy's a fucking idiot.
[86:57.14]He thinks we're gonna help him?
[87:03.20]Why is he Donald Trump?
[87:07.67]I'm so sorry about that until you believe me, Mr. Harrington.
[87:12.44]Trumpcast.
[87:14.94]Let me tell you something.
[87:16.50]Mr. Harrington, I will fix this permanently.
[87:19.58]I'm going to get rid of Comcast.
[87:21.08]Comcast will not exist.
[87:22.56]Excuse me.
[87:23.24]Comcast will not exist when I'm done with it, I guarantee you.
[87:28.93]This is Trump.
[87:32.15]Yeah, I'm sorry, guys.
[87:35.65]I can't stream like this.
[87:38.82]You want to know how many frames I dropped over the course of that because of fucking Comcast?
[87:44.36]34,000.
[87:45.02]Sorry.
[87:51.45]Hopefully this weekend, maybe I can make it up to you guys.
[87:54.67]If I stream.
[87:56.07]Because this shit's got to go permanently.
[88:00.58]But thank you, everybody.
[88:01.36]There was a lot of fucking big donations tonight.
[88:03.84]And I'm sorry that the stream's technical quality may have been lower than it usually is.
[88:10.10]But thank you, just nonetheless, for hanging out anyways.
[88:13.20]You guys all rock.
[88:14.94]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[88:16.70]I'll fucking hopefully figure this shit out and get it done.
[88:20.71]But in the meantime, take care, everybody.
[88:24.25]Thank you for hanging around for the hour and a half that I was at least able to stream 34,000 bits.
[88:36.15]That's a lot of frames.
[88:38.05]Yep.
[88:41.88]Yeah, and I said it earlier and I'll say it again.
[88:44.42]Could I just keep streaming at like a shitty fucking quality and like a bad bitrate and stuff?
[88:48.50]I don't want to do that.
[88:51.64]I don't want you guys to have to like deal with that.
[88:53.26]I want you guys to like be able to enjoy a clean stream.
[88:57.99]This game is worth another stream, to be honest.
[89:00.57]Yeah, I just... Yeah.
[89:03.47]If it works tomorrow, maybe I'll open up with this tomorrow and try some more actual battles.
[89:07.91]Or I'll do it this weekend.
[89:08.87]I'll give it another hour or two on stream this weekend, maybe.
[89:11.67]But goodnight, everybody.
[89:12.83]I apologize again for the internet issues.
[89:18.31]And take care.
[89:19.16]Have a good... Oh, ow!
[89:20.44]Take care.
[89:20.80]Have a good rest of your night, guys.
[89:22.36]Bye-bye.
[89:41.89]Thank you.
[90:16.19]you
