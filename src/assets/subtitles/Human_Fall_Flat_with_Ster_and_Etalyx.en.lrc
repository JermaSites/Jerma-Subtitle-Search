[ve:60.16.100]

[00:03.19]There you guys are.
[00:05.05]I missed you from the other night.
[00:08.93]What has it been?
[00:10.57]Let's take a look at the watch.
[00:13.45]24 hours?
[00:13.81]22 hours?
[00:14.53]46 hours?
[00:15.21]Where have you guys been my whole life?
[00:19.57]How are you?
[00:22.27]So tonight, hold on, hold on, wait until people are here.
[00:26.33]I don't want to start playing the video games and streaming the video games with my friends until everyone's here.
[00:33.56]Tonight, we're going to be playing Human Fall Flat with Star and Etalyx.
[00:43.55]You know, the boys are back in town, as they say.
[00:45.43]It's going to be the three of us having fun.
[00:50.78]You may have seen this funny LOL laugh out loud YouTuber streamer game before.
[00:56.26]We've never played it.
[00:59.15]I guarantee there's gonna be at least one or two funny laugh-out-loud moments, though.
[01:03.25]That's a... I... One or two.
[01:04.35]I'm not gonna say more than that.
[01:05.76]It might be less than five.
[01:15.66]Which streamer do you watch?
[01:17.92]Put them all up on the screen at the same time.
[01:25.77]I thought this day would never come.
[01:28.49]Well, it's here.
[01:30.65]Somebody just subscribe to the channel.
[01:35.33]Is there a multi-stream link?
[01:38.35]No.
[01:38.73]I'm not that well prepared.
[01:39.79]There's two other options.
[01:44.75]You know who to watch.
[01:46.10]You know who you should be watching.
[01:48.56]Starts with an M and ends with an E. You don't have to watch the other.
[01:53.54]You know where you should be right now, right?
[01:57.14]Right here.
[02:01.21]Okay, bye.
[02:06.65]Bye!
[02:09.01]We have a very, very well-timed, determined period where we're all going to come back and be in the call.
[02:17.72]And that is exactly two minutes.
[02:19.14]We want enough time for people to start their streams and say, Hey, yo!
[02:22.56]I'm streaming right now just in case you guys weren't curious about that.
[02:28.91]So.
[02:29.66]Minute or two.
[02:30.74]Just hang out for a minute.
[02:35.36]You're too excited?
[02:36.12]Calm down.
[02:39.86]Calm down before the ceiling breaks.
[02:41.22]No, even if the ceiling breaks, I'm staying alive.
[02:44.08]The whole thing could come crashing down.
[02:45.24]I got the Nintendo Labo.
[02:48.10]I could fix it with the cardboard that you get.
[02:53.05]What's up with a good mood?
[02:54.09]I've been in a great mood recently.
[02:55.73]The Labo stream, you know, all it took was building some stuff that was made for kids.
[03:02.37]Some pretend Lego system, and it elevated my mood.
[03:07.65]I have been in an elevated state for like two weeks now.
[03:10.89]It's great.
[03:13.37]It's mania.
[03:16.39]I'm okay with that, because you know what else has mania in it that's fucking awesome?
[03:19.85]WrestleMania!
[03:21.43]Hulkamania!
[03:23.46]Why should I be upset about that?
[03:32.17]I'm not greasy today.
[03:33.15]I did order a dehumidifier though.
[03:35.33]I saw a screenshot from the last stream.
[03:39.12]And it seriously looks like I've been locked in a hotbox for like 12 hours.
[03:42.20]It did not look good.
[03:43.30]I looked awful.
[03:45.00]So I'm gonna have to get the dehumidifier in here.
[03:49.98]I looked, there was some screenshots of that stream that I saw, I looked like shit.
[03:54.76]This red face with sweat on my forehead.
[03:58.62]I looked unhealthy.
[04:01.81]We doing cam today?
[04:02.63]No, no, we'll do, human fall flat, don't think needs it.
[04:07.79]And with that, it is, it's 625, and I'm sitting here waiting for people to come in and say hello. 625!
[04:20.21]What do you mean you've been here?
[04:21.91]The 25 just went through.
[04:24.74]Everybody's right on time.
[04:25.92]We're alright on time.
[04:32.64]Let's move over here.
[04:34.67]Intro can go away.
[04:37.25]And there we are.
[04:37.93]You guys are still in the game, right?
[04:41.21]Of course.
[04:42.97]Alright, so... You're probably wondering, hey, why do you got the split screen here, guys?
[04:47.90]That's because I made myself and Otto, and I always have to be with Otto.
[04:51.70]Because Otto is my best friend.
[04:53.52]Okay.
[04:53.90]And I already explained to everybody that this is a no-joke stream.
[04:57.30]We're doing the speedrun strategies, and we're working together for the world record.
[05:01.38]Okay.
[05:01.86]Okay.
[05:02.18]I think we can do it.
[05:04.00]Just get the clock ready and tell us when to start.
[05:06.78]Wait, we have to introduce ourselves.
[05:08.04]Okay, so naked Pikachu, that's Star.
[05:12.04]I can't look at myself.
[05:13.42]And then knight in armor with face guy, that's Etalyx.
[05:17.61]And then remember, I'm Otto.
[05:19.85]And you can't see me.
[05:23.03]But, uh, by the way, you can't see me, but that's my real stomach.
[05:26.31]That took multiple pictures.
[05:29.45]I can't see myself.
[05:30.87]You're not supposed to tell everybody that.
[05:32.73]What?
[05:34.01]That's my real stomach?
[05:34.97]You're gonna get banned.
[05:35.85]No, that's just a graphic.
[05:38.91]No, that's my fucked up belly button.
[05:41.77]Uh-oh.
[05:43.41]I'm being, uh... What are you doing?
[05:45.11]What's wrong?
[05:47.03]Why is he falling down?
[05:47.83]I'm being greeted by the ghost that haunts our streams.
[05:52.44]What's the ghost?
[05:54.84]I'm captured.
[05:56.58]Dare not say his name.
[05:57.68]You're getting Voldemorted right now?
[05:59.40]Jerma, Jerma.
[06:01.64]Come get my body.
[06:03.80]You actually added like an ass cheek thing here.
[06:05.90]Yeah.
[06:07.72]It's for you.
[06:08.28]Is there a flap?
[06:09.80]Did you add an asshole?
[06:10.62]Hold on, go back down.
[06:11.50]There's an asshole on your character, isn't there?
[06:13.10]You sicko.
[06:15.11]You have this big circle.
[06:15.97]I'm just...
[06:17.66]What's wrong with you?
[06:18.40]What?
[06:19.20]What do you mean, what's wrong with me?
[06:20.94]You added like a crotch zipper.
[06:22.32]Alright.
[06:23.16]No, it's my cheeks.
[06:24.84]My luscious cheeks.
[06:25.83]Me and Otto are going over here.
[06:27.19]Is this what you want?
[06:28.45]Is this what you want?
[06:29.87]Yes!
[06:31.43]No, get behind me.
[06:32.27]Alright, come on.
[06:32.95]We need to go.
[06:33.43]OK, speedrun strat, they just knock down this tree and they climb across.
[06:38.77]So knock the tree down.
[06:40.22]You got it.
[06:43.02]I care.
[06:44.74]This tree?
[06:45.38]Which tree?
[06:46.89]Yeah, they just knocked this down.
[06:48.57]Alright.
[06:50.33]I can't really do that.
[06:54.12]Yes, again, that is my real stomach.
[06:56.34]You can take pictures with your fucking webcam.
[06:58.58]Alright, come on, Otto.
[06:59.26]You're not helping.
[06:59.80]How are we supposed to knock this down?
[07:01.60]There's nobody else on the split screen.
[07:06.40]I'm controlling both these characters.
[07:10.43]What are you guys doing?
[07:11.93]I'm going in the door.
[07:12.83]You can't knock down those trees.
[07:16.20]I need to go.
[07:16.76]Okay, hold on.
[07:18.38]Can you spin us around?
[07:19.08]Can you pull me, too?
[07:20.10]Okay, grab the other hand.
[07:20.90]Wait.
[07:22.30]You need to turn, you need to, like, crack my back, because I'm facing the wrong way.
[07:25.32]Okay.
[07:25.82]I'll just come this way.
[07:27.18]And Etalyx is dead.
[07:28.42]Etalyx is gone, apparently.
[07:29.90]Attack!
[07:30.76]Attack along, Licks!
[07:33.58]Get, get, get at the end of the line.
[07:35.20]No, don't touch him!
[07:36.25]Hold on, we gotta watch a video.
[07:37.77]What do you mean, watch a video?
[07:38.93]What happened to a, what happened?
[07:41.27]You just grabbed an instructional video.
[07:44.53]Hold him tight.
[07:46.12]Get your hands off my dog!
[07:48.42]Carry me.
[07:49.72]See, the speedrun knocks down this video and you just climb across.
[07:52.00]Link your hands together and let me jump on top like a cheerleader.
[07:58.43]You want to do like a 1, 2, 3, throw him in the air?
[08:01.05]Let's see if we can do it.
[08:01.81]Alright, get on top.
[08:04.19]Okay, the speedrun definitely got past this already.
[08:07.07]Well, we're busy looking at video.
[08:08.83]Alright, let's go.
[08:09.57]Back up.
[08:10.25]Alright, let go of me.
[08:11.91]I just want to make a tango line.
[08:13.43]No, you want to do a speedrun and...
[08:17.06]Leave him alone!
[08:18.59]This looks a lot like my dog, actually.
[08:20.63]No, this is my dog.
[08:22.07]Don't say this is your dog.
[08:23.03]This is my dog.
[08:24.33]You know how I can tell?
[08:25.05]Because he has the black nose.
[08:26.45]Okay, we gotta put him in the middle.
[08:27.95]No, your dog has a brown nose.
[08:29.47]Whichever one he goes towards is the master.
[08:31.44]Fine.
[08:31.72]You want to put him in the middle?
[08:32.92]Alright, let him go.
[08:33.78]Let's see who he goes to.
[08:35.12]I'm not touching him, so you back away.
[08:37.54]No, you back away first.
[08:38.72]Alright, you back away.
[08:41.74]Put him in the middle.
[08:43.95]Alright, let go!
[08:45.73]We'll see who he wants to go to.
[08:47.89]Alright, ready?
[08:49.01]I'm gonna- so you- Otto!
[08:50.51]Otto!
[08:51.55]Otto!
[08:52.07]Otto!
[08:52.61]Otto!
[08:53.81]Otto!
[08:54.67]Oh, what a good boy!
[08:56.25]What a good boy!
[08:57.25]Yes!
[08:57.83]Come to dad!
[08:59.49]I've been betrayed.
[09:00.45]Alright, let's go.
[09:01.67]No.
[09:03.31]Come here, Otto.
[09:04.23]Let's go.
[09:09.18]We had this corrected before.
[09:12.62]No, Otto.
[09:13.18]This way.
[09:14.53]Otto!
[09:15.13]Otto!
[09:16.61]Oh, no!
[09:18.97]No!
[09:19.97]Now no one can have... Holy shit, that's the most progress you've made.
[09:23.27]Really?
[09:25.01]It got you through the door.
[09:26.03]Oh, holy... Wait, we got us through the door.
[09:28.17]Okay, that's fine.
[09:28.95]Oh, yeah.
[09:29.49]Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[09:32.43]Alright, that's fine.
[09:33.09]We're good.
[09:35.05]I wish I could see my body.
[09:36.27]It was very, like... It was really just... A little self-consciously, are we?
[09:40.42]Okay, we're good.
[09:40.96]Let's go.
[09:43.28]I worked really hard.
[09:44.20]Okay, can we, like, end the joke that I have to control two people at the same time?
[09:47.18]Because it's not possible.
[09:49.06]No.
[09:49.46]You need to beat one level like this, otherwise... Otherwise, you should never have made the joke.
[09:55.67]You gotta get in the way.
[09:57.03]Get in his way.
[09:59.11]So, because I need to turn the right direction.
[10:00.43]Almost, almost, almost.
[10:04.29]You're on, like, a reverse... I know, I don't even know how this happened.
[10:07.94]I'm so... It's on mirror mode.
[10:10.08]Alright, you grab... My controls have been inverted.
[10:12.14]Grab my left hand.
[10:15.63]Okay, wait, wait, wait, that's good, that's good.
[10:17.33]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[10:18.88]Stop, stop.
[10:19.32]Okay.
[10:20.08]Let him go.
[10:23.58]Fuck, how did you... Why did that happen?
[10:26.52]Alright.
[10:26.76]Just pick yourself up.
[10:28.92]Stop strangling him.
[10:31.19]It's not gonna work.
[10:32.59]We cannot physically... We're having a gang beast fight right now.
[10:36.23]Pick me up.
[10:36.69]Pick up Otto.
[10:37.95]I pick up Otto and bring him everywhere anyways.
[10:39.35]Alright, let's go.
[10:44.54]Come up the stairs.
[10:45.02]That was the easiest.
[10:45.74]Alright, now put him down.
[10:47.10]But if you put him down here, like up here facing.
[10:50.00]I'm losing it, I'm losing it.
[10:55.28]Fuck over here.
[10:58.64]He's dead.
[11:00.48]Alright, how do I disconnect auto?
[11:04.83]Listen, listen.
[11:07.19]Yes.
[11:08.93]Climb the stairs.
[11:10.86]It's so hard when I... Okay, wait, wait.
[11:12.46]If you push... Just get him.
[11:13.44]I'll get him upstairs.
[11:14.61]Hold on.
[11:14.83]I think I have an idea.
[11:15.91]Look at how low my head is.
[11:17.11]Look how sad I am.
[11:21.61]Turn him.
[11:23.05]He needs to be facing the right way.
[11:24.27]Atalix, Atalix, pick him up.
[11:25.63]Atalix, keep him up.
[11:27.16]Pick up who?
[11:27.78]The dog?
[11:28.46]You pick up the dog, I'll pick up Jerma, and we'll go play the game.
[11:31.30]No.
[11:32.72]I want to play.
[11:34.24]No.
[11:35.04]Pick him up.
[11:36.80]Pick him up.
[11:37.22]What about my dog?
[11:39.30]We're bringing your dog.
[11:41.90]Open the door.
[11:42.38]I'm arresting the dog right now.
[11:44.80]I'll open the door.
[11:45.40]Open the door.
[11:45.88]Behind his back.
[11:46.98]I can't.
[11:47.32]There we go.
[11:52.20]I've got you, Jerma.
[11:52.82]Alright.
[11:53.24]Keep going.
[11:53.70]Come with me.
[11:54.26]If you want to live.
[11:56.36]You're giving me an atomic wedgie right now.
[11:58.21]That's all that's happening.
[12:00.67]We're going to the next thing.
[12:01.83]Alright.
[12:02.73]Let's finish this level quick so we can delete Otto from the game.
[12:06.23]Wait, wait, wait.
[12:08.29]You can press these buttons.
[12:10.46]I'll lift you up and you can press the button.
[12:12.00]Let go of his head!
[12:12.64]Let go of his head!
[12:13.24]He's revolting.
[12:14.22]He's revolting a little here.
[12:16.32]I'll get the button.
[12:17.68]You're making me tall enough to do it.
[12:19.00]Thanks, Dad.
[12:20.90]Got it.
[12:22.28]Wait, I gotta get the low one too.
[12:24.27]Okay, you touch that one and then I bring you down.
[12:25.95]Other hand.
[12:27.75]Other hand.
[12:28.23]I got it.
[12:28.55]There we go.
[12:29.13]Okay.
[12:29.71]Let go.
[12:30.03]Let go.
[12:30.47]Let go.
[12:30.91]Let go.
[12:31.61]Alright.
[12:32.01]Watch my head.
[12:33.93]Ow!
[12:35.25]This thing stretched my neck back.
[12:38.35]Wait, were we already here?
[12:40.19]Up the stairs.
[12:41.82]Up the stairs.
[12:42.56]Speedrun.
[12:43.08]Speedrun.
[12:46.44]This is easy.
[12:47.06]This is for toddlers.
[12:47.60]Actually, jumping makes that easier.
[12:49.12]Alright.
[12:50.16]Okay.
[12:50.54]Press the buttons.
[12:51.46]I got this.
[12:52.32]Hold on.
[12:52.60]You're gonna... Over here.
[12:53.40]I got one.
[12:53.86]I got two.
[12:55.32]Let go.
[12:56.04]Jerma, jump.
[12:58.34]Thank you.
[12:59.44]You're gonna break... You broke his arm!
[13:00.64]Hey!
[13:03.24]Okay.
[13:03.52]We did it.
[13:03.76]You did it.
[13:04.20]Okay.
[13:04.46]Now, can we please get Otto out of the game?
[13:06.12]Mission one.
[13:07.89]Okay, I'm not invited.
[13:10.27]No, no, no!
[13:11.19]I don't... Okay, how do I delete him from the game?
[13:18.65]I don't know.
[13:19.65]You have to not be in split screen mode anymore.
[13:22.21]But I'm not in split screen.
[13:25.99]I didn't do anything.
[13:27.51]Try rejoining the game.
[13:28.95]Okay, I'm going to leave the game.
[13:31.53]Exit.
[13:33.35]Okay, it's just me now.
[13:35.10]Play.
[13:36.49]Online.
[13:36.85]Sir, what's wrong with my left leg right now?
[13:41.11]There we go.
[13:42.67]You flamingoing?
[13:45.72]Okay, that's good.
[13:46.88]I'm back now.
[13:49.50]You have a broken left leg.
[13:51.82]I'm just hopping around on one foot.
[13:55.23]I want to sit here too.
[13:55.95]How do you sit down?
[13:57.95]Press X and you dead weight.
[13:59.85]You starfish.
[14:00.77]Oh, you mean like add a player to the game?
[14:02.71]Call the auto?
[14:04.23]Did it?
[14:04.77]What?
[14:05.23]That just added a player.
[14:06.39]I pressed... No.
[14:08.19]He's back.
[14:09.91]He's like the shade of our past haunting the rest of the game.
[14:13.07]What is he doing?
[14:14.41]No.
[14:15.09]No, I don't want to do it again, Dad.
[14:18.09]Please don't delete me.
[14:19.87]Don't delete me.
[14:25.53]I can't get rid of that.
[14:29.19]Hold on.
[14:29.57]I gotta... If I press... This leg situation may make the rest of the game very difficult.
[14:38.69]Hold on.
[14:38.97]Controls.
[14:39.39]I mean, you're still walking.
[14:41.93]Play dead.
[14:43.40]You seem fine.
[14:47.52]Yes?
[14:47.64]How the fuck am I gonna do this?
[14:48.56]I can't play dead, ever.
[14:52.95]Wait, hold on.
[14:55.13]I think I know what's going on.
[14:56.06]No.
[14:57.38]I think I have to take off, like, my PlayStation 4 controller.
[15:02.08]Hold on, give me a second.
[15:04.22]Controller configuration.
[15:06.80]How do I make it so auto is... Oh, look, Jerma's holding everyone up.
[15:12.39]Hold on.
[15:13.71]Haven't seen this in a while.
[15:14.81]Stop it, stop it, stop it.
[15:15.81]Holding everyone up.
[15:17.15]Alright.
[15:18.80]Generic.
[15:20.04]No rumble.
[15:20.56]Got my leg back.
[15:21.72]I got my arm behind my head just looking like you like what you see.
[15:25.70]I do.
[15:26.73]How do I make it?
[15:27.47]La la.
[15:28.55]Hey, meet me after the stream, you know?
[15:34.27]Why is it not happening to you guys?
[15:36.91]Because we're not idiots.
[15:38.69]I didn't do anything.
[15:39.80]I pressed X and what do you want me to do?
[15:44.12]Should I remake?
[15:45.40]No.
[15:45.60]Or restart level, invite friends?
[15:49.22]I just can't press X, apparently.
[15:52.70]You're not even in this game.
[15:53.64]Where are you?
[15:54.50]I'm here now.
[15:55.28]I just can't press... I cannot press the square button.
[15:58.68]Okay, well don't.
[15:59.54]I'm not gonna press it for the rest of the time, so let's go.
[16:01.30]It's not an important button.
[16:02.68]Oh my fucking god.
[16:03.86]I mean, it is... Did you press it?
[16:05.92]No.
[16:06.42]I pressed right trigger to grab... Hey, do you have two controllers plugged in?
[16:11.02]Nope.
[16:12.08]Well, your one controller is controlling both people, right?
[16:14.96]Yes.
[16:16.73]How does it make any sense?
[16:18.49]This doesn't make any sense.
[16:19.73]Actually, now that I really think about it, it really doesn't.
[16:22.45]This makes no sense.
[16:24.63]Why can... It's two the same controller.
[16:28.30]Do a dance.
[16:32.68]That's... It's my keyboard?
[16:35.12]Should I just unplug the keyboard?
[16:37.66]I'm ripping the keyboard out.
[16:39.75]Let's see if that fixes it.
[16:42.09]No, it's not.
[16:44.47]I have no idea.
[16:46.21]Use the keyboard.
[16:47.01]No, the keyboard's not even working.
[16:50.69]My life is just fucking full of it right now.
[16:52.71]Hold on.
[16:53.95]I'm going to like exit the whole thing and I'm going to like turn this thing off and... Hold on a second.
[17:00.02]Just keep auto.
[17:00.76]I can't just keep auto.
[17:04.30]Well, then I can in real life.
[17:06.96]You guys just have fun for like a minute while I figure this out.
[17:13.20]Controller settings.
[17:14.68]Okay.
[17:15.98]Just generic gamepad support.
[17:17.76]That's what I'm going to use.
[17:18.50]Alright, let's open it back up.
[17:25.92]Human fall flat.
[17:26.86]Let's see if this fixes it.
[17:31.42]Put auto down.
[17:33.14]He's not even here.
[17:33.70]Okay.
[17:36.05]Human fall flat.
[17:37.35]Go into the game right now.
[17:38.81]Tell me I didn't fuck this up for somehow.
[17:43.11]Is the PS4 to Xbox controller...
[17:46.23]No, I don't have DS4 Windows.
[17:49.30]Steam is recognizing that I have my PS4 in.
[17:52.02]I just turned off the PlayStation 4 support.
[17:55.24]Etalyx mentioned before this that whenever you guys play a game, there's always a problem.
[18:00.97]I'm starting to see where the problem comes from.
[18:03.43]No, it's not just me.
[18:05.13]This is a true story.
[18:06.23]Before the stream, we said, let's all get in the game and make sure everything works.
[18:09.25]We played it for like five minutes.
[18:10.73]It worked.
[18:11.59]And I said, doesn't matter.
[18:12.49]Something's still going to go wrong.
[18:14.38]We're good.
[18:14.62]We're good.
[18:14.84]We're good.
[18:15.68]We're fine.
[18:17.02]And I was told the power of positivity would make it not so.
[18:20.34]No, we're good.
[18:20.68]We're good.
[18:21.16]We can play.
[18:21.50]Get up.
[18:26.24]I'm ready.
[18:27.82]I had to turn off the PlayStation 4 support in the Steam menu.
[18:32.19]And that's apparently how you fix it.
[18:33.33]Just blame big picture mode.
[18:34.97]Big picture mode.
[18:36.23]It's not big picture mode.
[18:37.09]It's the fact that Steam doesn't understand.
[18:39.59]Doesn't get it.
[18:40.25]Alright, I'm ready.
[18:42.17]Let's go.
[18:43.17]Okay, first person up the train wins.
[18:46.47]How do I get back up?
[18:50.93]How come I can't stand up?
[18:56.32]Oh, after you dead weight, you stay down for a while.
[18:59.56]Oh, okay.
[19:01.60]Alright, so what's the goal here?
[19:03.90]Grab onto this one.
[19:04.50]Climb the train.
[19:06.85]Door.
[19:07.81]Door.
[19:08.35]Door.
[19:08.53]Door.
[19:10.65]Make a perception check.
[19:13.83]Alright.
[19:14.43]I rolled a four.
[19:15.75]Did I win?
[19:17.29]No.
[19:20.01]Who's the DM?
[19:21.32]Did I keep fucking smashing my head into the wall here?
[19:25.99]Hey, come on up whenever you're ready.
[19:27.41]You know, the water's nice.
[19:31.05]Why are we skipping this?
[19:33.72]Skipping what?
[19:34.42]Are we skipping the level?
[19:35.40]Why are we climbing up this?
[19:37.20]Because if you get up the wall... No, we don't want to play the game.
[19:39.92]Then you sequence break.
[19:41.16]Then you get up the wall and then you sequence break it.
[19:43.88]Oh, I'm sequence breaking.
[19:47.52]I gotta get over there before he does.
[19:49.58]Get out of the fucking way.
[19:53.09]Push me up.
[19:54.07]Good luck, baby.
[19:54.75]I'm trying to pull you down.
[19:55.91]I helped you beat the whole last level.
[19:57.81]Yeah, but I was in distress.
[20:02.95]Fuck off me.
[20:06.90]Now where are you going?
[20:07.82]You crying in my nipple?
[20:09.32]Yeah.
[20:10.80]Does it hurt?
[20:12.12]Good.
[20:13.62]Oh, god damn it.
[20:14.32]Alright, I'm going.
[20:15.02]Fine, you do that bullshit way.
[20:16.52]I'll see you later.
[20:25.38]How did you do this?
[20:28.66]Get up here.
[20:32.00]Why can't I get up the dumpster?
[20:36.88]Come on.
[20:38.78]Alright.
[20:40.24]You climb shit.
[20:41.40]Where are you guys?
[20:42.32]Alright, I'm good.
[20:45.46]We're doing the correct way.
[20:47.58]Oh.
[20:49.18]So I cheated.
[20:49.72]Oh my god.
[20:54.83]This is a puzzle game.
[20:55.99]We have to solve the puzzles.
[21:00.00]What?
[21:00.28]I didn't grab you?
[21:01.74]No, go away.
[21:02.48]Go away.
[21:02.82]Finish the level without me.
[21:03.66]Climb the other side.
[21:04.54]This is my side.
[21:05.06]Finish the level.
[21:05.40]Finish the level.
[21:05.90]You can do it, son.
[21:14.89]I don't get it.
[21:15.43]It's because you can jump and... You don't have to jump.
[21:18.79]You just aim.
[21:19.71]You look up.
[21:20.39]Oh, my God.
[21:20.83]We did it.
[21:21.13]Good job, Etalyx.
[21:23.82]Hey, I'm still on the speedrun.
[21:27.42]You have to look down to climb up.
[21:29.42]Okay, here's what you do.
[21:30.58]I need to test this.
[21:31.68]You get around this wall.
[21:32.76]Sequence break.
[21:33.20]Alright, that's how you do it.
[21:34.08]I get it.
[21:35.52]Wait, have you actually been watching people speedrun this game?
[21:38.03]No, I haven't.
[21:38.99]I'm just trying to break it.
[21:40.43]Hey, hey, hey.
[21:43.23]It's alright.
[21:46.57]I can't lift.
[21:47.25]Alright, hold on, hold on.
[21:48.47]Just stay there.
[21:52.48]This is probably so painful for you, isn't it?
[21:54.94]Alright, just swing me.
[21:56.82]Come on, Etalyx!
[21:58.44]I'm trying to swing!
[21:58.90]Swing me left and right.
[22:00.02]Also, I didn't catch you anyway.
[22:01.37]Alright, hold on, I got my other- We need to build a human- a human rope.
[22:05.03]Yeah, human rope.
[22:05.77]Come on.
[22:06.37]Come on.
[22:06.59]Look, you guys are like, I gotta do curve around the side wanted style.
[22:10.63]You can do it.
[22:11.11]Just try- now you can just grab my head.
[22:13.61]Yeah.
[22:14.15]No, grab- I swear to God, if you just go around.
[22:19.38]Grab- you know, you should grab his head too, see if you can pull it off.
[22:23.34]Do you think we can pull his head off with enough pressure?
[22:28.88]You're not making it.
[22:29.50]I'm on you.
[22:31.58]No, I can totally make that.
[22:33.58]My feet are clearing the floor.
[22:35.72]I can't even reach up.
[22:36.56]Well, if you make it, I've got it.
[22:39.30]I wonder if I can climb up from you.
[22:41.64]Jesus!
[22:43.10]Oh, fuck.
[22:43.99]Is that all I've ever been to is a stepping stone?
[22:47.81]Oh, I'm even higher now than I was before.
[22:51.01]Come on.
[22:51.81]Here.
[22:52.46]You gotta let go of your left.
[22:54.34]No, you let go of your right.
[22:57.99]I'm letting go.
[22:58.47]Hold on.
[22:59.61]No!
[23:00.81]I had to.
[23:01.45]There was no way for me to grab.
[23:04.03]I actually saved him.
[23:05.73]You could have been saved.
[23:07.13]Now you get the checkpoint.
[23:08.11]Congratulations.
[23:09.30]Yeah.
[23:09.70]Contributed so much to that.
[23:10.88]Alright, let's go.
[23:15.12]I think it wants us to put the box on that thing.
[23:16.86]Yeah, you gotta climb the box.
[23:19.68]Okay, I didn't do that.
[23:20.66]You did.
[23:22.86]Don't blame that on me.
[23:24.76]Leave him behind.
[23:25.42]Leave him behind.
[23:25.98]Wait, why do you even need this?
[23:28.92]It's because you don't know how to climb at this stage of the game.
[23:31.84]You're still a newbie.
[23:33.42]You have to learn how to climb later.
[23:35.24]Yeah, I got... Have you played this before?
[23:38.11]You said you played when it was new.
[23:39.85]I played it like two and a half years ago.
[23:41.47]Alright, so we're going to press... You have to hold... No, it's hot.
[23:44.31]You have to stand on it.
[23:45.29]So you're going to stand on that.
[23:46.95]It's just like Portal.
[23:47.73]It's a co-op moment.
[23:48.79]This is a co-op Splinter Cell moment.
[23:50.39]I think you'd still be using the box at this point.
[23:54.97]That really lights up your ass real well, I think.
[23:56.47]What do you need?
[23:56.91]Nope, I fell.
[23:59.01]Thank you.
[23:59.41]Oh, in the door?
[23:59.83]Just go over like a four-year-old.
[24:01.81]Nope, you can't squash me.
[24:02.51]Sorry, man.
[24:24.49]Are you sure about that?
[24:25.77]I guess you can, maybe.
[24:27.47]Alright, see you later.
[24:28.87]Hey, wait.
[24:30.57]Yeah, I actually can't move.
[24:34.17]You guys can just keep... It's not... Wait, no, no, I know it's funny.
[24:39.12]That's funny, but you can press the button.
[24:43.24]You can't squarsh me.
[24:52.34]Alright, now open it.
[24:53.40]I'm doing it.
[24:53.96]I'm doing it.
[24:57.56]Is this the end?
[24:58.20]How did this happen?
[24:59.06]I don't know how this even ended up happening.
[25:01.78]How are you trying to throw me off?
[25:05.39]What about my pants?
[25:06.27]My pants are gonna come off.
[25:10.01]Yeah, we're not moving.
[25:10.89]This is not it.
[25:12.23]This is not changing.
[25:15.23]Gotta get up.
[25:15.95]Am I winning?
[25:17.36]I can't from here.
[25:18.52]There's no... Well, we're losing, so...
[25:22.71]I was too busy getting squished.
[25:26.94]You guys done goofing around?
[25:29.46]I don't think I'm allowed to, like... Oh, I see.
[25:31.46]You're supposed to put the box up there.
[25:33.06]I'm going underneath the level.
[25:37.79]Wait, are you still not respawned?
[25:39.27]I'm just... No, because I don't need to.
[25:40.73]I'm going to finish the whole thing.
[25:42.13]No, I'm not.
[25:42.53]Goodbye.
[25:45.65]Fine.
[25:46.57]I'm locked out here by myself.
[25:47.71]I'm here now.
[25:48.35]Well, you'd certainly be right for pressing me into a sardine.
[25:51.65]Here.
[25:52.07]Actually, can I press this?
[25:56.32]And that opens the door.
[25:57.82]So you can go in there.
[25:59.32]I'll help you.
[25:59.90]See?
[26:02.48]Fine.
[26:04.46]Oh, I can do this on my own.
[26:06.38]Can you?
[26:06.70]Yeah, you got it.
[26:09.04]Fine.
[26:10.68]So now you have to... Now he presses this and I jump over there and do a front flip.
[26:16.29]Fine.
[26:18.37]How are you climbing?
[26:19.49]Hey, can you please not just touch buttons?
[26:21.87]I'm going to get on there.
[26:23.23]How am I supposed to complete the level?
[26:25.41]Can you please leave the button?
[26:26.94]I was doing fine without you.
[26:28.34]Can you please not touch any buttons?
[26:35.38]Hey, I'm here.
[26:36.08]How did I do that?
[26:37.52]I just slid under it.
[26:41.41]Yes, I slid under it somehow.
[26:44.48]You need to press that button right now.
[26:46.04]That's why everyone likes you.
[26:49.10]You're a sensible person.
[26:53.89]That's why they like him, huh?
[27:06.60]Alright, let's go.
[27:07.94]Oh, we're on the wrong side.
[27:09.46]We're alright.
[27:12.04]Watch this shortcut.
[27:13.22]Can you do it?
[27:15.78]No, apparently not.
[27:18.38]No, I can't.
[27:18.92]But you can.
[27:20.69]I can.
[27:22.31]You gotta move this red thing over.
[27:27.61]Yeah, yeah.
[27:28.71]Crush him, crush him, crush him.
[27:30.03]No, I'm trying to learn how to swing around.
[27:32.99]What are you made out of?
[27:35.97]Stop.
[27:36.29]Hey.
[27:37.37]Crush him.
[27:38.84]Crush him.
[27:39.34]Crush him.
[27:39.88]Crush him.
[27:40.98]Or one person could have stood here.
[27:42.38]That's as far as I could go.
[27:43.62]If you were a team-oriented person.
[27:45.46]Oh, yeah.
[27:45.84]There's the guy that decided to press this thing into me.
[27:48.14]Okay.
[27:48.36]Thank you.
[27:50.80]Are you going anywhere or are you just hanging out?
[27:52.90]I mean, I was stuck under there.
[27:53.86]Alright.
[27:56.03]We're good.
[28:02.49]We did it.
[28:03.63]Alright.
[28:04.09]Now we'll go one by one.
[28:07.82]It did it.
[28:08.02]Nice job.
[28:08.42]Alright, now we're in the forest level.
[28:09.44]We'll all go at the same time.
[28:10.72]Alright, just be careful.
[28:13.09]We need to learn.
[28:18.65]See?
[28:18.93]There's one jump.
[28:20.43]We need to learn.
[28:21.91]We need to learn.
[28:22.65]Sorry.
[28:23.59]You bumped me.
[28:24.07]You bumped me and it caused me a problem.
[28:25.26]That was an accident.
[28:26.86]Okay, so we just have to... This is a platforming level.
[28:30.88]Hold on, guys.
[28:33.52]I need to learn.
[28:35.63]I hope he falls.
[28:37.01]So then we can just all laugh at him.
[28:42.72]Hold on.
[28:43.20]I'm learning.
[28:47.96]Hold on.
[28:50.26]Have you learned?
[28:50.68]It's getting a little crazy here.
[28:51.92]Don't come across until I tell you it's safe.
[28:53.72]Okay, is it safe?
[28:56.85]I mean, he's learning.
[28:58.23]He is learning.
[28:59.37]I'm seeing learning in real time.
[29:00.69]Fuck!
[29:01.75]I'm also seeing remedial learning in real time.
[29:04.17]God damn it.
[29:05.01]I was a little too long.
[29:06.91]Hold on, guys.
[29:08.77]I'm learning.
[29:10.07]Hold on.
[29:10.31]I'm learning.
[29:10.77]One of these dumb spaghetti games.
[29:17.24]If you want to play a real game, you just turn on your SEGA Genesis again.
[29:21.36]I didn't even have one of those.
[29:27.18]Reach up.
[29:27.72]Go over.
[29:29.86]I can still do it.
[29:33.66]Is my character fatter than you guys' characters or what?
[29:36.44]Hey, help me up.
[29:40.12]You pull me up.
[29:40.70]Somebody pull me up.
[29:41.94]Somebody pull me up and then I'll pull you up.
[29:45.34]Someone push me up and then I'll pull you up.
[29:49.16]Look, I can only push you up if you pull me up first.
[29:51.96]And I can only pull you up if you come back and push me up.
[29:53.76]There's no way.
[29:59.34]I have to swing.
[30:00.62]Okay, I'm touching.
[30:01.33]Okay, I got you.
[30:03.97]I'm not holding on anymore.
[30:05.23]Grab, grab.
[30:08.26]I'm one hand blocking you to the ground.
[30:09.90]My hands are just stuck behind.
[30:11.32]There we go.
[30:12.20]Lift him.
[30:13.34]Lift him.
[30:15.18]Thank you.
[30:15.98]You need to come help me.
[30:18.90]Oh my god.
[30:19.60]Hey, what's happening up there?
[30:26.13]How did you fall again?
[30:27.97]I didn't jump in time.
[30:29.13]You have to preload your jumps.
[30:36.44]Just don't do the whole thing again fuck it.
[30:39.34]I hate everyone Did you make it These are hard God Fuck it.
[30:56.97]I'm going the safe way.
[30:59.03]What's the safe safe ways all the way around this I?
[31:04.96]I'm not going to get stuck there again.
[31:06.10]I mean, you only get stuck if... Is that a way to go?
[31:11.92]I'm already right next to you guys.
[31:14.64]See, this is the correct way.
[31:17.85]We need to watch the instructional video, guys.
[31:20.11]We can't just... We don't know how to work any of this.
[31:22.19]Climbing.
[31:25.07]Climb higher.
[31:27.08]Jump before grabbing the edge.
[31:30.56]Raise your hands running towards the obstacle.
[31:33.63]Jump to grab the edge.
[31:34.51]You need to raise your hands up.
[31:36.27]Lower your hands.
[31:37.21]Have them raise it.
[31:38.35]That makes so much more sense.
[31:40.93]So you have to put your hands in the air first, like this.
[31:47.63]Okay, honestly, that changes everything.
[31:49.58]Aren't you glad we looked at that?
[31:51.46]No.
[31:51.66]The speedrun does not look at that.
[31:57.18]We need to, like, learn how to play.
[31:59.26]Speedrun does not stop to look at that.
[32:04.14]Nobody's even beat this game.
[32:06.69]Okay, one at a time.
[32:07.31]I'm not tall enough to do this.
[32:10.83]Alright, so look up with your hands.
[32:12.09]There you go.
[32:13.19]You got it.
[32:13.87]That's much easier.
[32:24.67]This is actually kind of fun.
[32:26.31]Also, don't you think it's a little bit like... They put the climbing tutorial at the top of the climb.
[32:32.22]Come on.
[32:33.04]I mean, we did pass up one or two other instructional videos.
[32:36.88]Yeah, but there was like two.
[32:37.92]You just wanted to go so fast.
[32:40.14]You've always been about the speed.
[32:43.08]Uh-oh.
[32:44.14]What?
[32:47.62]I see death in our future.
[32:49.16]Do you?
[32:51.57]How so?
[32:52.15]That's a pretty big mountain over here.
[32:53.97]Oh, fuck, really?
[32:55.31]That's a huge mountain.
[32:57.05]Okay, just like the tutorial told, one at a time.
[32:58.96]You got it.
[32:59.30]Oh, god damn it.
[33:03.16]I think it also matters if you hold the jump button down longer.
[33:11.55]Just pick me up!
[33:13.52]Oh, he still did?
[33:14.71]You just did the movie.
[33:16.23]Like, fall down the cliff, but he's still hanging on.
[33:20.53]So you have to aim.
[33:21.53]You have to aim all the way up and jump off, right?
[33:24.05]Like, that's like hard to see where you can't even see the ground.
[33:27.07]I'm waiting.
[33:31.43]How are you supposed to do that with the sticks?
[33:36.34]Well, it's where you put your hands up and then you walk forward and just jump.
[33:40.72]Just jump.
[33:43.28]See, you did it.
[33:43.94]You're, you're, you're, you're gaining it.
[33:46.23]Yeah.
[33:46.99]Okay.
[33:47.27]He's on his way.
[33:48.65]Okay.
[33:49.91]Thanks, guys.
[33:51.99]Okay, now we all need to Geronimo.
[33:54.85]What?
[33:56.43]There's a rope, and we're about to Indiana Jones.
[33:59.23]What do you mean, about to Indiana Jones?
[34:01.27]Grab the rope.
[34:02.11]Grab the rope.
[34:02.87]Grab me, grab me, grab me, grab, no, not that high up.
[34:05.24]Trust me, grab my butt, grab my butt, grab my butt.
[34:07.06]Okay, I'm locked up.
[34:07.68]Well, grip!
[34:08.48]Please, it has no, no, my butt has no grip.
[34:09.92]No, your ass is really gelatin-like.
[34:11.36]It's not gonna help me.
[34:12.24]Okay.
[34:13.52]Everyone all at once.
[34:14.28]We gotta jump off.
[34:15.52]One, two, three.
[34:19.82]Oh, boy.
[34:20.22]We're not gonna have enough time.
[34:21.63]No, it wasn't far enough, you guys.
[34:24.81]Hold on.
[34:25.95]I'm gonna get over there and I'm gonna help you guys out.
[34:27.53]You're just stuck on the rope.
[34:28.65]Alright, hold on.
[34:29.97]Help!
[34:30.61]Just stay there.
[34:31.73]Just stay there.
[34:32.91]This is gonna take me a minute, but I have to swing back and forth like three times.
[34:36.69]One.
[34:36.83]Alright, while you're doing that, I'm gonna try to learn how to climb.
[34:39.60]Two.
[34:42.77]Okay, here we go.
[34:45.05]You got this.
[34:48.77]Alright.
[34:50.64]Come here.
[34:53.76]I can't... So, don't start grabbing me because I'm the only one over here.
[34:59.28]You're over there?
[35:00.18]Yeah, okay, so... Oh, you made it.
[35:02.67]I think you could... Like, we're doing the swing technique.
[35:13.59]I just gave up.
[35:15.03]No, hold on.
[35:15.45]Let me just stand up.
[35:16.77]Hold on.
[35:17.11]Wait, wait, wait.
[35:17.57]I'm going to fall off.
[35:19.75]Okay.
[35:20.21]Can you grab my ass?
[35:23.23]That's what I asked you, and you wouldn't do it.
[35:24.89]Alright.
[35:25.17]Hold on.
[35:25.39]Wait, wait, wait.
[35:25.91]Grab my leg.
[35:27.03]I'll put my leg down for you.
[35:27.83]This is way more solid.
[35:28.87]Can you get it?
[35:30.07]Hold on.
[35:30.47]Hold on.
[35:33.29]Grab my leg.
[35:35.97]You got it.
[35:36.43]I got it.
[35:36.73]Alright.
[35:39.18]Okay.
[35:39.93]I can't.
[35:40.87]Oh, you really grabbed my leg here.
[35:42.51]You grab the ground and pull forward.
[35:47.65]Yeah.
[35:49.15]Nice.
[35:50.27]How did you?
[35:51.13]No, don't.
[35:51.91]Really.
[35:52.65]I can't fucking believe it.
[35:55.89]I can't believe it.
[35:56.92]You got to be on guard.
[35:58.80]I can't believe you did this.
[36:01.35]Understand?
[36:03.07]That was so, so mean.
[36:06.61]What a great moment.
[36:07.65]That wasn't even fun.
[36:08.67]That was just mean.
[36:12.81]How are you supposed to climb?
[36:14.41]Oh, shit.
[36:16.45]Oh.
[36:18.33]True camaraderie.
[36:20.79]I'm just letting go.
[36:21.78]Fuck it.
[36:22.20]He's already up there.
[36:23.10]No, it's not.
[36:24.20]It puts you all the way back here.
[36:25.74]Oh, my.
[36:26.16]That's so far away.
[36:27.32]We can't fuck this up.
[36:28.12]Blame him.
[36:28.78]I'm winning the speed run.
[36:29.68]I'm winning.
[36:31.16]Yeah, because the last checkpoint was across the chasm.
[36:33.57]Unbelievable.
[36:35.73]I don't think we can do it like this.
[36:36.89]Here, come back here.
[36:38.47]Wait, can we do it like this?
[36:39.33]Where's the rope?
[36:40.53]We're going to go up on the train.
[36:41.59]This game's so easy.
[36:42.59]Oh, he just blocked me.
[36:44.67]Oh, you can climb on the train.
[36:46.97]Hang on.
[36:49.41]I'll help block you.
[36:53.91]I'm just going off again.
[36:56.71]wait I'm just gonna watch you you're free to go wherever you want alright let's try this again we need the weight of both of us on here why is this little spot even here I don't know it's probably like a little secret you can do I would assume there's a little secret huh I need is it can someone else come to this side and help me you know that would be great if we could do that imagine if there was another person over there right now it would help
[37:28.31]Can you imagine if there was another guy over there?
[37:30.55]How much easier would this be?
[37:32.29]What are you supposed to do about the rope just in the middle?
[37:35.73]I didn't even think about that.
[37:37.23]That's true.
[37:37.89]Climb the tree.
[37:38.37]It's just hanging from the... Climb the tree.
[37:40.62]Well, if we could climb the tree, we wouldn't have fallen off of the side of the cliff.
[37:43.48]Okay, so this is impossible then.
[37:45.26]No, I can run and grab it.
[37:46.54]I'll try to run and grab it.
[37:48.62]There's definitely a way to climb in this game.
[37:52.48]Oh!
[37:53.69]Oh, he made it.
[37:54.41]I got the bottom of that rope.
[37:55.83]Okay, hold on.
[37:56.39]Can I swing it to you?
[37:57.79]I'm coming.
[38:00.01]Hold on, I'm gonna try to swing it over to you.
[38:01.60]Wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[38:04.72]I didn't, I was gonna swing it to you.
[38:09.16]I'm waiting here for you.
[38:11.50]I wanna make this easy for you.
[38:15.34]Forget about that guy back there.
[38:18.04]Who loves to make the funny throw-you-off-the-cliff joke, but then when he needs somebody, it's like, where is everybody?
[38:24.36]Yeah, I don't know where to go.
[38:25.30]It's becoming an issue.
[38:29.34]Well, we'll be there in a second.
[38:30.16]Swinging it back.
[38:30.98]I'm coming.
[38:31.86]Hold on.
[38:32.08]Do you understand the timing on this is going to have to be impeccable?
[38:35.78]Just... Not really.
[38:37.67]Once it goes forward... Alright, I'm going back now.
[38:42.85]I'm swinging forward now.
[38:44.11]No, I'm going to wait.
[38:46.97]I'm going to wait.
[38:47.41]Okay, wait for one more.
[38:48.96]One more.
[38:50.46]Alright, swinging back.
[38:51.56]Here I come.
[38:52.12]Coming forward.
[38:55.42]Did you get it?
[38:55.76]Got it.
[38:56.26]But I'm really high up.
[38:57.70]You are.
[38:57.98]Can you slide down?
[38:59.20]Just slide down a little.
[39:01.96]Hold on.
[39:02.57]I'm afraid if he's... Wait till we hit the apex of the swing.
[39:05.35]Did you fall off?
[39:05.81]No.
[39:05.97]Oh, he's gone.
[39:07.27]No.
[39:08.85]I fell.
[39:09.79]Alright.
[39:11.01]Go ahead.
[39:11.97]Go on without me.
[39:12.97]I'm going to try to get this.
[39:13.91]I need to swing back and forth.
[39:17.27]There's no way to slide down that.
[39:19.07]You were just gone.
[39:20.53]Alright.
[39:20.85]I'm going to try.
[39:21.25]Here we go.
[39:29.25]I see that.
[39:31.13]Can I climb from here, though?
[39:33.35]There's a way to climb, but I have no idea what the technique is.
[39:36.50]Probably passed up one of the promotional videos.
[39:40.96]You definitely could just swing back and forth.
[39:44.06]And then look up.
[39:46.70]Okay.
[39:47.18]Well, someone's gonna have to win.
[39:51.11]Or just get a checkpoint.
[39:52.13]This works slowly but surely.
[40:03.02]Is it working, though?
[40:04.31]Kind of.
[40:06.21]Oh my fucking god.
[40:07.33]Nope.
[40:07.81]Bye.
[40:09.71]Hey, welcome back.
[40:11.51]Oh!
[40:11.93]You swing... I'm gonna... You... I'm gonna try to test this, because if you swing back and forth... Hang on.
[40:17.03]Hang on.
[40:17.56]What is this?
[40:18.56]Come over here.
[40:20.20]Yeah!
[40:23.82]No, I'm, like, still... Sorry, I'm getting off.
[40:29.44]There's a... Somebody said there's a left path over here.
[40:33.19]Yeah, there is.
[40:34.97]Clim- How the fuck am I not climbing this?
[40:36.59]Go!
[40:38.09]Climb it!
[40:38.51]What are you doing?
[40:39.25]I was grabbing onto it!
[40:44.79]Hey!
[40:45.09]Heh.
[40:46.09]I gotta make this fucking train.
[40:48.60]Good thing we spent, like, the last 20 minutes trying to swing on a rope!
[40:52.44]We could've been done.
[40:55.74]Yeah, do you, uh... Where are you?
[40:58.22]There you are.
[40:58.58]I'm up here.
[40:59.81]Hold on.
[41:00.47]This level's boring.
[41:01.37]New level.
[41:01.67]What are you doing?
[41:02.71]Oh, alright, fine.
[41:03.47]Thank God.
[41:04.55]I beat it.
[41:07.70]We had just figured out how to cross, too.
[41:09.50]Alright, so what do we do with the, uh, with the Tic Tacs?
[41:15.06]You eat them.
[41:15.66]There's one for each of us.
[41:16.62]This just shows how little we are, right?
[41:18.76]We're in a world of small things.
[41:22.18]I'm gonna pull off the pieces of bread.
[41:25.55]Get the garlic bread off.
[41:37.32]Let go.
[41:37.92]Let go.
[41:38.74]Let go.
[41:40.68]No touching.
[41:41.46]Go in timeout, sir.
[41:42.86]You know that I'm naked.
[41:44.40]You know this.
[41:45.18]Okay.
[41:45.60]What are you guys doing?
[41:48.99]He knows I'm naked.
[41:49.99]Will you stop doing the... I try to go as fast as I can.
[41:52.03]Stop doing the pull-ups on my ass.
[41:54.21]Stop trying to go so fast.
[41:56.89]You guys definitely didn't clean anything up either.
[42:00.08]Okay, lift me.
[42:07.02]I'll stick around.
[42:07.64]Okay, I'm coming through.
[42:09.02]I'm gonna grab the tic-tac because you guys won't do it.
[42:10.64]I'm just like, I'm playing for you.
[42:13.64]But you just have to reach out and grab stuff sometimes.
[42:16.42]I broke it.
[42:18.07]Are you happy I broke it?
[42:18.99]What did you break?
[42:21.13]We need this thing.
[42:27.19]Move.
[42:29.19]We're definitely gonna need this.
[42:31.96]Okay, so grab the lever.
[42:33.74]I did it.
[42:35.17]It broke the wall.
[42:36.59]You already did the fun thing with autos?
[42:38.91]Let go.
[42:39.67]Talons won't leave me alone.
[42:41.09]Alright, so you guys have to go down there and fill these things with Tic Tacs.
[42:48.47]Why do we have heroic music playing right now?
[42:50.97]Because I broke the wall, and this is the end scene of Westworld where you break the wall.
[42:57.72]Is that real?
[42:59.88]Don't say that.
[43:00.92]Did you just actually spoil the whole series for me?
[43:04.93]No, you didn't.
[43:07.39]Why would you spoil the whole... That's...
[43:15.26]Yes, yes, Jorma.
[43:16.40]The ending to Westworld is that they break the wall.
[43:19.80]Yeah, well, that could mean anything.
[43:21.80]That could mean like, oh, yeah, I know what that could mean, though, is what I'm saying.
[43:26.38]I know what that could mean.
[43:29.69]Look, we need to make a pillow for it, so you jump over it.
[43:31.99]Did you just break that glass?
[43:33.09]Can we not just break this glass, too?
[43:35.05]You can, but I want it to climb the wall.
[43:37.65]Okay.
[43:37.77]Okay.
[43:40.21]That made the weakest glass breaking sound.
[43:44.27]Alright, so you guys, you fill this up, and I'll be the designated arm puller.
[43:49.15]We don't need to fill it up.
[43:50.53]What is with you?
[43:51.63]I want to have the, you don't want to have any fun.
[43:53.81]I want to have fun.
[43:54.69]Me and the Talics want to have fun.
[43:56.13]You want to do it family?
[43:56.79]Do you want to fill this thing up?
[43:59.88]What are we filling?
[44:01.32]Forget it.
[44:03.00]Ow, my feet, blood.
[44:06.20]Ow, my feet, blood.
[44:07.32]Alright, let's go.
[44:09.39]I'm in the thing now Okay, I guess I guess we're not gonna do this I guess we're not in the thing now I'm just here.
[44:23.31]I made it as Ross.
[44:24.13]Etalyx.
[44:24.57]Just ignore him.
[44:25.35]Just ignore me I'm going over here.
[44:29.73]I made it through There's a Miley Cyrus over here
[44:44.80]Help me flip this.
[44:46.54]We have to pull this over here.
[44:48.18]No, flip it.
[44:49.20]Flip the wheel.
[44:52.12]Caveman.
[44:52.76]Which way are we putting it?
[44:54.10]We all put our weight on it.
[44:55.87]On one side.
[44:58.15]So we need to flip it.
[45:00.35]I'll push it.
[45:01.65]I'm pushing.
[45:02.29]I'm going to be the push.

[45:05.87]Almost.
[45:10.30]Almost.
[45:10.86]Almost.

[45:15.70]Okay, now roll the macaroni.
[45:16.88]No, roll the macaroni.
[45:18.37]Where are you rolling it to?
[45:19.13]You're gonna roll it off.
[45:21.41]Exactly.
[45:21.87]What do you mean, exactly?
[45:23.19]Alright, exactly.
[45:24.81]Roll it into me.
[45:27.33]Wait, no.
[45:27.53]Wait, wait, wait.
[45:28.03]You put the wedge here.
[45:29.73]You can use that as a ramp.
[45:30.71]Oh, wait.
[45:31.09]Is somebody gonna go in the middle?
[45:32.25]Like, we're rolling somebody down a hill?
[45:36.12]You just need it to jump across.
[45:38.91]No, I want to go in.
[45:40.19]I guess I want to be rolled in.
[45:42.29]Alright, go Ragdoll.
[45:45.19]Yeah, just put me in.
[45:47.57]Spool me through the thread.
[45:49.47]Put me in.
[45:49.87]Uh-oh.
[45:55.18]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[45:56.56]Don't put that much pressure.
[45:58.28]Just stuff me in there.
[46:01.22]I can't.
[46:02.70]There's too much of you.
[46:04.56]Wait, wait, hold on.
[46:05.96]This is truly one of the good old, like, black screen, just listen to Jerma saying, stuff me in there.
[46:12.15]One of the good olds.
[46:13.93]Alright, it's not gonna work.
[46:14.85]It's not gonna work.
[46:15.39]Let's just roll it.
[46:19.55]Okay.
[46:20.47]Now come back over here.
[46:22.53]Why are you turning?
[46:23.13]Are we trying to roll it to the other side?
[46:24.36]Yeah, we're gonna roll it over to the other side.
[46:26.13]Oh.
[46:26.73]So, ready?
[46:27.09]I'm gonna grab right here.
[46:28.71]You grab the other side.
[46:29.25]You realize that when we grab it, it's not gonna roll, right?
[46:31.43]No, we're gonna push.
[46:31.87]It's gonna roll.
[46:32.91]Push.
[46:33.35]You can't grab it.
[46:34.11]You just, like, have to run into it.
[46:35.71]Yeah, that's fine.
[46:36.24]And then you push it, and then it'll get stuck in the middle, and you can just walk across.
[46:39.32]Ready?
[46:40.12]Push.
[46:42.82]What?
[46:44.20]I told you when you're holding on to it, it won't push.
[46:46.70]Let go.
[46:51.56]That was the expected outcome.
[46:53.62]I thought we were going to get at least a little bit.
[46:55.52]Alright, so how are we supposed to get over there?
[46:56.96]Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[46:58.08]Wait there.
[46:58.46]Just wait for two seconds.

[50:21.37]Okay.
[50:23.95]What do you need me for?
[50:25.45]I was pulling you because I said he's thanking a subscriber or a donator, so we have to move him.

[51:30.64]No, I can't.
[51:31.18]If I let go, then I'm going to fall over the way of the trash can.
[51:34.72]I did this.
[51:35.68]I'm the Joker.
[51:36.60]I'm the Joker.
[51:38.66]The way of the trash can is going to pull me to my death.
[51:43.11]I have to hold on.
[51:45.77]You're fine.
[51:46.33]You'll stand up once you drop it.
[51:49.15]Or just grab the red thing.

[52:10.17]What do you mean?
[52:10.91]The Mario pipes?
[52:11.85]You can probably jump from here.
[52:13.11]Yeah, you can jump from here.
[52:13.79]Yeah, I was thinking of climbing up the construction thing.
[52:16.69]Dude, when you look down and walk, you're like a monkey.
[52:19.59]Alright, I made it.
[52:21.02]You just have to jump.
[52:22.74]That looked like it hurt real bad.
[52:25.08]It did.
[52:25.68]Look, you look down and you go... Wait for a towel.
[52:31.66]Where are you a towel?
[52:32.26]I wanted to try something, but I don't think I have the strength to do it.
[52:34.68]Are you still up top?
[52:36.60]Yeah.
[52:38.13]Hey, was this another speedrun?

[54:15.68]That's a pretty good strategy.
[54:17.58]What do those do?
[54:18.92]I think we have to put this on here?

[57:50.96]It could just be used by anyone.
[57:53.13]With his body here?
[57:53.85]What is it?
[57:54.53]It's like a person lying here.
[57:58.77]Oh, I wonder if there's any loot on him.
[58:00.65]I wonder if he's a secretly alive NPC that's going to spring up as soon as you try to loot him.
[58:05.38]No!
[58:05.92]I was just about to get the rod.
[58:09.30]I didn't know you wanted that.
[58:10.54]Sorry!

[63:21.38]Pull it back.
[63:26.80]Are you helping?
[63:27.82]I'm trying to pull it back.
[63:31.72]I give up.
[63:38.60]I don't believe you.
[63:43.66]I'm gonna ruin everything.
[63:44.38]It's gonna be so funny.
[63:46.04]I can't do it anymore.
[63:46.91]It's over.
[63:48.05]It's stuck.
[63:49.25]You can't ruin it.
[63:50.33]I can't ruin it.
[63:50.95]It's stuck.
[63:53.03]This was never... It was designed to not happen.
[63:57.63]Actually, we got really nice and close, though.
[64:06.96]I'm putting a big one in.
[64:12.22]Nice.
[64:12.48]Alright, this is a huge one.

[64:37.01]Wow.
[64:37.77]Pull it.
[64:43.86]I don't know why.
[64:45.00]Like, the first one went over it, and then you pushed it further forward.
[64:49.16]It's still going the same distance.
[64:52.02]Can we pull this back?
[64:52.80]This isn't breaking it more.
[64:58.41]I think we just have to go over it.
[65:08.40]This is hopeless.
[65:09.66]Get over there.
[65:13.20]Just climb through, just climb through, just climb through.
[65:14.80]Put your head down.
[65:17.22]Alright, you ready to pull it back?

[65:50.21]There's guard dogs.
[65:50.87]I knew it would be dogs.
[65:53.11]I can't even pull it.
[65:54.95]Oh my god.
[65:56.75]I made it.
[66:00.66]Pull me.
[66:01.72]There's guard dogs coming.

[66:09.84]No!
[66:10.00]No!
[66:10.32]Alright, I can do it.
[66:11.78]He left me.
[66:12.64]I was abandoned.
[66:13.48]Please, I want to squeeze!
[66:18.20]I... I can't get you.
[66:22.70]Alright, I got you by the head.
[66:23.38]You got me.
[66:23.86]You got me.
[66:24.48]Pull, pull, pull, pull.
[66:25.78]Alright, at some point, you're too fat to get through this.
[66:31.45]I'm not fat!
[66:35.07]I mean, you're a little fat.
[66:37.05]No, it's not going to happen.
[66:38.85]I'm not fat.
[66:39.69]Get off me, then.
[66:40.27]Get off.
[66:40.85]You don't have any faith.
[66:41.67]I don't need this.
[66:43.40]That almost just crushed me.
[66:46.54]Oh, wait, no.
[66:46.88]Pull me now.
[66:47.24]Pull me now.
[66:47.66]Come here.
[66:48.28]Come here.
[66:48.50]Pull me.
[66:48.92]I'm going to move this out of the way.
[66:50.22]If I dead body, then you can pull me.
[66:52.10]How is this possible?
[66:55.02]Both hands.
[66:56.90]Pull my head.
[66:57.32]Pull my head.
[66:57.86]Oh, yeah.
[66:58.23]Get it.
[66:58.67]Get it.
[66:59.13]Get it.
[66:59.57]Get it, darling.
[67:00.79]Whoa.
[67:02.25]I got to pull you this way.
[67:03.59]I got to rip your head around.
[67:06.70]I can definitely fit.
[67:07.98]I fit in tighter places.
[67:11.40]It's not going to happen.
[67:12.92]It's not going to happen.
[67:14.40]You're destined to be in there forever.
[67:17.88]Come on.
[67:18.74]This game sucks.
[67:23.21]Hold on.
[67:23.49]Can I break this?
[67:24.37]What if I go up here?
[67:25.33]How is it still clearing the whole wall?
[67:29.09]Etalyx, just put yourself in it and clear the wall.
[67:32.57]No.
[67:32.75]If I break the wall, I'm all for you.
[67:34.11]Yeah, but how are you going to get in?
[67:35.90]Hold on.
[67:36.62]Let me direct you.
[67:43.73]Okay.
[67:45.89]Maybe I can grab the rock out of midair.
[67:47.93]Aim for my hands.
[67:48.57]Oh, it's because I... Okay, but still.
[67:53.11]Alright, aim for my hands.
[67:53.85]I'll grab the rock.
[68:00.29]Is this really the level we're stuck on?
[68:01.82]I'm doing it, I'm doing it.
[68:04.38]Like the easiest one?
[68:05.46]You're not gonna do it.
[68:09.88]Go, go, hey.
[68:11.20]Did you make it?
[68:11.94]No.
[68:13.60]Oh, what happened?
[68:14.14]No!
[68:14.76]I looked down at you being a dumbass!
[68:17.67]Oh, come on.
[68:18.37]Fuck yeah!
[68:18.95]You gotta be kidding me.
[68:19.53]Oh, you wanna climb through?
[68:20.41]We just changed places.
[68:21.17]Did you guys just do like a, like a Freaky Friday?
[68:24.15]God damn it, we just Freaky Friday'd.
[68:25.75]I can't believe it.
[68:27.21]No, I'm going to legs first.
[68:28.79]Grab my legs.
[68:30.82]You can't put your legs in first.
[68:32.20]Yes, I can.
[68:32.65]Watch.
[68:32.89]Just grab my leg.
[68:37.11]Grab it by the legs.
[68:38.17]I'm going to dead weight here.
[68:40.07]You have to grab me by the legs.
[68:42.19]Oh, my God.
[68:42.89]Reach in there and grab my leg.
[68:44.44]I can't reach.
[68:45.76]Hold on.
[68:46.40]I can do it.
[68:47.20]Why are these rocks so unwieldy?
[68:50.08]Okay.
[68:52.22]Right now.
[68:52.52]Here we go.
[68:53.58]Hand.
[68:54.93]Hand?
[68:55.71]Grab my hand.
[69:00.49]Wait, you just do that again.
[69:01.41]Do what you just did like three more times.
[69:04.41]Hold on, I can do it too.
[69:12.66]Enough's enough.
[69:14.32]Now I'm here.
[69:16.96]Yeah, you just like kind of moved it around.
[69:19.82]Jerma.
[69:21.54]There's a gate in the front.
[69:22.92]What?
[69:23.04]There's so many of these rocks.
[69:24.10]What do you mean, what gate?
[69:26.35]There's a gate you can open in the front.
[69:29.35]Oh.
[69:33.13]Oh, who am I?
[69:35.25]Who am I?
[69:36.47]Who are you?
[69:37.51]Let's see.
[69:38.55]I can take a guess.
[69:40.57]Okay, you are... Is this that heavy?
[69:49.18]Okay, who are you?
[69:52.84]Um, you are... Gordon Ramsay from Half-Life.
[69:56.86]No, I was going to say old white beard guy from Lord of the Rings.
[70:03.64]Ganondorf.
[70:04.40]Ganondalf.
[70:06.22]You're going to tell me you're not going to be able to pass.
[70:10.08]No.
[70:10.72]That's not what it was.
[70:12.62]He was going for a... What are we going to do with the milk?
[70:16.85]I think he was going for a Mary Poppins penguin dance number.
[70:21.79]I'll take care of the milk.
[70:25.41]Where do I bring this?
[70:29.53]We definitely need this for something.
[70:33.96]You just push it forward so you can jump up the stairs.
[70:36.02]Okay, I'll take care of that.
[70:38.14]There's a door here, too.
[70:39.90]No one cares.
[70:40.36]Secret door.
[70:41.36]No one cares.
[70:41.86]No one cares.
[70:42.36]Alright, it's in the right spot.
[70:45.49]Oh, that's a shortcut.
[70:46.43]The cheese is in the right place.
[70:49.57]Don't forget who put it there.
[70:53.01]Really?
[70:53.49]How?
[70:54.15]Come on, man.
[70:54.77]Really?
[70:56.75]I'm holding the right keys, man.
[71:00.38]Really?
[71:01.62]Metallics, really?
[71:03.90]I can't.
[71:06.94]Really?
[71:08.56]I'm doing my best, okay?
[71:11.24]That's all I can do.
[71:12.01]Alright, let's keep going.
[71:20.15]Where did he go?
[71:22.11]I don't know.
[71:22.75]Why is he not here with us?
[71:23.70]He's probably roleplaying as a person in the house.
[71:26.24]Probably a peasant in the house down there.
[71:27.94]Really?
[71:28.34]Okay.
[71:30.47]Oh, oh my!
[71:31.75]Where art thou, peasant in house?
[71:35.53]You need to collect taxes!
[71:38.60]You owe 24 quid in taxes!
[71:40.82]You're not even in here.
[71:42.68]What the f- I think he's gotta be hiding at this point.
[71:52.14]He's not saying anything.
[71:53.16]He's not doing anything.
[71:57.04]Where are you?
[71:59.44]Wait, wait, what?
[72:00.70]Where are you?
[72:01.28]What are you doing?
[72:02.34]I went in the door up top.
[72:03.68]What do you mean the door up top?
[72:05.32]The door up top.
[72:07.46]I see a Dark Souls bell.
[72:09.27]This one.
[72:10.65]Which one?
[72:11.87]Up here.
[72:12.55]You guys didn't even come up here.
[72:13.91]Did you try the door?
[72:16.21]And then we jumped down and there's a lock on this door.
[72:18.57]You didn't even try the door.
[72:19.99]We opened the lock on this door.
[72:21.29]I did try the door.
[72:22.57]It's on the bod.
[72:24.74]What are you, a fucking idiot?
[72:26.02]Alright.
[72:26.54]Hold on, I'm coming out.
[72:27.20]I want to go that way.
[72:30.66]Also, I think there's a way to go over here.
[72:32.56]Yeah, the way that you're shot.
[72:35.83]I'm going the wrong... This is not the right way.
[72:38.25]What did I do?
[72:45.88]By the way, bunny hopping is much easier.
[72:47.42]So from here, are we going in the water?
[72:49.56]Water rapids!
[72:51.88]Okay, no.
[72:54.06]I don't know.
[72:54.82]I don't know anymore.
[72:55.60]I don't know where I am.
[72:56.50]I don't know why any of this matters.
[72:58.44]Oh, I figured it out.
[72:59.22]I got it.
[72:59.92]You figured it out?
[73:00.40]I thought I had a life.
[73:01.17]Yeah, you solved the puzzle.
[73:02.37]What was the puzzle?
[73:04.77]I just don't.
[73:06.61]Ah, that's a pretty good puzzle solver.
[73:08.39]Bring the cheese in.
[73:09.19]Good work.
[73:10.45]Bring the cheese.
[73:11.59]Bring the cheese.
[73:12.29]I wouldn't even think about that.
[73:13.13]Oh, what?
[73:13.31]Are we some kind of, uh, are we seeing a rat now?
[73:15.81]No, it's a big block of white.
[73:17.69]That's either cheese or milk.
[73:18.77]Pick one.
[73:21.45]Look, man, if you don't want to RP, you get poked with a stick.
[73:27.32]It's either cheese or what?
[73:29.38]Is this astronaut milk?
[73:31.20]It's milk.
[73:31.78]It's cheese or milk.
[73:32.94]Or tofu.
[73:33.38]How is it milk, though?
[73:34.44]I'm okay with cheese.
[73:35.58]Like, I can understand.
[73:36.32]Because it's a box of milk and there's a bunch of milk bottles inside of there.
[73:39.18]Or it's a block of tofu.
[73:40.07]What else is it?
[73:41.47]What are... Can you bring the block of cheese over here?
[73:44.09]Do you see what I'm doing at this very moment?
[73:46.17]Can you do it a little faster?
[73:46.93]What is it?
[73:47.57]What else could it be?
[73:48.59]I want to be corrected.
[73:49.59]Because apparently this can't be anything else.
[73:53.43]It's cheese?
[73:54.13]I mean, what about marble?
[73:55.77]Like, stone.
[73:56.49]No, this is not shiny enough.
[74:02.28]It's not even close.
[74:03.32]This is bullshit.
[74:05.94]This whole game sucks.
[74:06.86]I give up.
[74:08.72]Hold on.
[74:09.12]How did you just do that?
[74:10.66]I'm too good at it.
[74:13.37]Where are you?
[74:15.13]I overjumped the first thing.
[74:16.77]I'm having trouble doing this.
[74:20.85]Are you in my way or something?
[74:22.45]It's my turn to be good and efficient.
[74:25.15]I can't.
[74:25.77]Well, you just... Okay.
[74:35.60]Alright.
[74:38.94]Oof.
[74:40.48]Overshot it, overshot it, overshot it.
[74:41.88]Oh, you did the same thing I did.
[74:47.18]Grab my legs.
[74:48.14]That's what I'm trying to do.
[74:56.16]I need to get two hands on you.
[74:57.16]I don't feel confident here.
[74:58.40]Okay.
[74:59.80]So wait, don't go yet.
[75:01.34]On this one.
[75:03.30]And... No, no, no, not confident enough.
[75:05.94]You need to do it.
[75:07.34]We don't get speed because we're hitting you.
[75:08.98]It's not gonna work.
[75:11.21]I told you I need to push speed.
[75:13.55]I can get this.
[75:18.43]You're just holding me down.
[75:22.41]What?
[75:27.96]Oh no, Etalyx is gonna do the me and win the game and I'm not gonna get to see the rest of the level.
[75:31.56]I'm trying to unlock the shortcut for anybody that dies and I can't do it.
[75:34.70]I would have had that.
[75:35.71]We needed more speed and I couldn't get it.
[75:41.99]And now, for some reason I cannot grab this.
[75:45.17]If you fall you die and you deserve to die.
[75:47.24]This is the hardest thing to grab in the whole game.
[75:49.50]Fucking stupid cheese block.
[75:51.42]If you break that on the first try I'm gonna all F4.
[75:58.70]Good.
[75:58.86]Hang on.
[76:00.86]Let's do it together.
[76:03.60]Teamwork.
[76:04.80]I almost didn't get that.
[76:05.52]Back and forward.
[76:08.12]Okay, never mind.
[76:09.62]Who wants Jerma with us anyway?
[76:11.64]I'm here.
[76:12.72]Wait.
[76:14.07]No.
[76:14.61]You had fun dumping me.
[76:15.89]No.
[76:16.43]You just, like, dumped me into the water.
[76:18.05]No.
[76:18.69]No.
[76:18.93]You've got to let go.
[76:19.95]You're too heavy.
[76:22.39]No.
[76:23.29]Wait, wait, wait.
[76:23.87]I need that.
[76:24.69]Talos.
[76:26.33]No.
[76:26.77]No.
[76:26.91]Don't I need that?
[76:27.55]No, I don't.
[76:33.38]What?
[76:34.10]And he's gone.
[76:35.36]I don't care.
[76:35.72]He's back here anyway.
[76:36.94]Seriously, I'm trying to back up and I was watching you because I thought I needed the lantern and then I just forgot it.
[76:43.24]We made it.
[76:43.64]I did it.
[76:44.60]Where are you?
[76:45.62]I made it.
[76:45.86]You have a checkpoint over here.
[76:47.23]Oh, there's a checkpoint here.
[76:48.19]Hey, I won.
[76:53.11]Are you sure we don't need this block of milk?
[76:54.39]No, there's another one over here.
[76:55.89]Who needs blocks of milk?
[76:56.63]There's blocks of milk up here.
[76:58.39]Milk's in front of the whole way up.
[77:04.05]Uh-oh.
[77:05.43]Did you ring the bell?
[77:08.65]This isn't the right way.
[77:11.24]What?
[77:13.40]This has to be here for a reason.
[77:14.66]It has to be here for a reason, though.
[77:18.18]Does it, though?
[77:19.20]Oh, Etalyx, you push that block of cheese over here.
[77:22.38]Oh, really?
[77:23.30]Interesting.
[77:24.14]So that you guys can shortcut ahead of me faster?
[77:26.83]Thanks, man.
[77:27.83]Hey, thanks, dude.
[77:28.59]Waving at you.
[77:29.05]Can you see me?
[77:30.95]Hey, we're up here.
[77:31.89]Can you see me?
[77:32.27]Yep.
[77:33.62]Up there, yeah, I see you.
[77:35.48]Hold on, where are you?
[77:36.24]Turn on your phone flashlight in the audience so I can see you.
[77:40.60]Just turn the block of cheese and put it to this roof.
[77:43.50]Put it to the roof, put it to the roof.
[77:44.89]Hey, Etalyx, push it forward to this roof.
[77:46.91]Well, listen, we're driving a trailer backwards.
[77:49.35]Can you push it forward?
[77:52.29]I mean, you understand how carts work, right?
[77:54.07]Normally you put the horse or the donkey up here and this is the front.
[77:57.51]So we're really pushing it backwards.
[78:00.22]Which is why it's so difficult.
[78:01.42]You guys are turning.
[78:02.04]You guys gotta cut the turn right now.
[78:03.52]You gotta go the wrong way.
[78:04.54]There you go.
[78:06.90]Look, you think I haven't driven with a trailer before?
[78:08.76]Okay, by the way, he's not doing anything.
[78:13.83]He's just in the way.
[78:16.73]He is in the way.
[78:17.35]He's struggling to climb up.
[78:18.89]My hands hurt.
[78:20.89]So just go like this.
[78:21.63]Put your hands down.
[78:22.17]You really do have to biscript the controller to play this game.
[78:24.85]Yeah, it does.
[78:25.23]It does hurt.
[78:27.17]We're doing fine, though.
[78:28.39]We can take a quick little break if you want, where we just hang out.
[78:31.41]Do you think we could sue them?
[78:34.55]Why did you say that?
[78:35.29]Like, I almost missed the jump.
[78:37.83]You... Oh, I almost missed the jump because you made, like, a... Because I laughed, but I let go of the jump thing, because I was laughing at that stupid thing you said.
[78:45.67]Alright.
[78:46.53]It's really easy.
[78:47.28]If you don't do this, then go out of here.
[78:53.10]Whoa!
[78:53.26]Alright.
[78:54.68]No, talcs, talcs.
[78:55.50]That's...
[78:59.68]I missed.
[79:00.24]I was trying to get one of you.
[79:02.10]Trying to get one of us?
[79:03.43]How?
[79:04.99]I'm out of my way.
[79:08.65]Hey, just dead weight for a second.
[79:10.25]Hey, hey, okay.
[79:10.95]Fuck, I was trying to tell you something.
[79:15.07]Gotcha.
[79:16.65]I don't want to hear it.
[79:19.36]Hey, this area looks really interesting and fun.
[79:22.12]You fucking shitty.
[79:23.58]You shitty person.
[79:24.96]Oh, god damn it.
[79:26.46]I do have to help him because...
[79:31.00]I'll take care of it.
[79:32.42]Pull from the back.
[79:33.75]You want to just pull from the back?
[79:35.39]You do the turns.
[79:35.91]I'll push this way, you pull that way.
[79:38.17]I'll do the turns.
[79:39.09]Just wait, don't move it.
[79:42.37]I think the wheel's stuck.
[79:43.59]Okay, ready?
[79:44.43]I'm pulling.
[79:47.37]I'm currently, by the way, I'm currently off the ground.
[79:50.69]I'm not helping you.
[79:51.73]I'm just a kid on a shopping cart.
[79:57.77]I'm just yelling at you instructions of the foods that I'd like to eat today.
[80:01.67]Hey, can I get you a, uh, a lunchable?
[80:03.79]Do you want the pizza lunchable, or do you want the little turkey sandwich?
[80:09.03]Yes, bitch!
[80:11.47]Whoa.
[80:12.79]Uh, you, um, you don't get to ride in the fun race car-looking shopping cart next time.
[80:19.50]We're gonna put you in the, uh, the booster seat.
[80:24.42]Time out.
[80:25.24]He said time out.
[80:26.06]Nobody said time out.
[80:27.00]I'm a spoiled little rotten little shit!
[80:32.01]I'm lagging.
[80:33.61]Grounded for life.
[80:37.67]Are we on level like 1 out of 20 right now?
[80:40.90]I don't know.
[80:42.44]I have no idea.
[80:50.18]I love how complacent you are as, like, the mom in that scenario.
[80:56.73]You're just like, what would you like, sweetie?
[81:00.95]Of course I want that!
[81:03.27]It's like Veruca.
[81:06.51]I'm pretty sure at this point if you guys were to jump off, you'd teleport.
[81:10.97]Well, this is not even in the right spot.
[81:16.93]This is kind of a far jump, don't you think?
[81:21.16]for you.
[81:22.44]I might need your help here.
[81:23.24]Nope.
[81:30.43]Was I making you uncomfortable?
[81:32.01]A little, actually.
[81:33.11]I've been thrown off like five times.
[81:36.15]The funniest part was we were walking in sync.
[81:39.79]Oh, in sync!
[81:41.07]Look at how much fun he's having over there with giant candy.
[81:43.62]I'm having lots of fun.
[81:45.28]There's gotta be a shortcut to just get around all that.
[81:49.66]I'm just going to walk over here.
[81:51.58]Actually, it covered the jump from there.
[81:56.17]Somebody just said, congrats on becoming a father.
[82:00.51]You're my son.
[82:01.79]Oh, I get it.
[82:03.11]My son.
[82:06.35]My son.
[82:06.81]Everything you see before you.
[82:10.23]Everything the light watches.
[82:11.98]Nothing to do with the house, then.
[82:14.22]I feel like I need a person to be this far, and then you could do this easy.
[82:18.44]Alright, well, we're currently about to be there.
[82:20.71]And by about... There's a slide.
[82:21.97]Did you go down the slide?
[82:24.41]There's a slide.
[82:24.99]How are we not gonna do the slide?
[82:26.39]You talking about the, uh, the vert pipe?
[82:28.47]Oh, we have to go.
[82:28.91]Like, the half pipe?
[82:29.89]Oh, no.
[82:30.31]I think I can do it without these losers.
[82:32.87]Get there quick, dude.
[82:33.81]Don't let them show us up anymore.
[82:36.23]Uh, you go first.
[82:41.78]Oh, no.
[82:42.30]No, it fell off.
[82:42.92]The thing fell off.
[82:44.67]How am I supposed to do this?
[82:45.35]You've got another one.
[82:45.95]It's behind you.
[82:47.93]What?
[82:48.11]I have to hook this on?
[82:50.13]Apparently he set that up already.
[82:51.57]It wasn't supposed to be there by default.
[82:57.36]I'm touching the water.
[82:58.16]I'm out in American Ninja Warrior.
[83:01.62]Star, how the fuck did you do this by yourself?
[83:05.14]It did take us a while, to be fair.
[83:07.02]Oh, you just hook it and you swing across?
[83:09.28]Yeah.
[83:10.30]You do?
[83:11.58]Yeah, as you do.
[83:15.19]I gotta grab from the end, then.
[83:20.37]Grab the end.
[83:21.31]Okay, hold on.
[83:21.91]I almost got it.
[83:29.99]I gotta turn it.
[83:31.35]This is the wrong way.
[83:37.56]God damn it.
[83:38.14]I need your help!
[83:38.84]Get over here!
[83:39.78]I'm currently trying to hook this thing.
[83:41.18]Oh god, no.
[83:49.88]Alright, almost got it.
[83:50.64]There has to be, there has to be an easier way.
[83:59.94]Eat shit, game.
[84:03.67]I'm almost there.
[84:04.33]I bet he didn't do it like that.
[84:05.65]Can you get me?
[84:06.81]Like what?
[84:07.41]I bet you didn't do like a fucking... Aladdin from Super Nintendo and like jump and bounce off the thing.
[84:13.91]Alright, can you reach me?
[84:17.15]Hold on, I don't want to die.
[84:18.53]Hold on, I got a little closer.
[84:25.46]Okay.
[84:25.72]Okay.
[84:26.50]I got you.
[84:27.84]I got you.
[84:28.18]Thanks, buds.
[84:28.74]Thanks, buds.
[84:29.16]Human stampede.
[84:30.38]Almost.
[84:32.64]Human stampede.
[84:33.08]Gotta use that other hand.
[84:33.92]Got it.
[84:34.60]Nailed it.
[84:35.04]Okay, now this is... You run in the treadmill, and it lowers and raises the stone.
[84:39.35]Cool.
[84:42.91]I haven't been able to do it alone.
[84:45.95]So we need two gophers.
[84:51.09]Is it already raised?
[84:51.85]Two gophers.
[84:52.53]Oh, it's lowered.
[84:53.31]It's already lowered.
[84:53.99]Yeah.
[84:55.54]So you need to just raise it by running this way on the gopher wheel.
[84:58.30]Yeah, gopher, gopher, gopro.
[85:02.71]I see ya, suckers!
[85:05.65]I mean, I knew it was coming, but... I mean, like, you were the one on it.
[85:09.05]We were doing it for you to go across.
[85:10.81]Alright, I'll get you, Etalyx.
[85:15.60]You get over there on it.
[85:16.32]Uh, I think he's lowering... He's lowering a, uh, olive branch.
[85:22.28]Oh, he's got a piece of wood.
[85:25.53]I don't know, maybe... I think we'd push it up and tilt it over and climb it.
[85:32.26]Oh, and it totally could have just been a walkway.
[85:34.76]Yeah, why did you just dump it over here?
[85:37.32]See ya, suckers!
[85:38.34]Yeah, now that is a see ya, suckers moment, because now we're... Alright, I talk, so you grab the top.
[85:42.04]Hold on, I got an idea, I got an idea.
[85:43.76]Everyone makes mistakes.
[85:44.96]Pick up this opposite side of me, right here.
[85:47.31]No, no, no.
[85:47.85]Alright, like furniture, okay, I understand.
[85:49.61]No, no, no, no, no, like go onto the... across from me.
[85:55.19]You stand on that side, bend down, pick up.
[85:58.67]Okay, now move back behind you, backwards.
[86:03.85]This is just like Dark Souls.
[86:05.79]Put it on the rock.
[86:06.95]That's as far as it can go.
[86:08.23]That's as far as it can go.
[86:10.03]Now, hamster wheel.
[86:12.33]I see.
[86:12.81]I'm going to stand on one side and jump on the other one that's going to launch you up, like a cartoon.
[86:16.41]This is just like Dark Souls.
[86:17.67]Hamster wheel's not going to work.
[86:18.81]It's going to... I have to be on... Wait, wait, wait.
[86:21.29]I have to be on here.
[86:21.87]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[86:26.37]No, no!
[86:27.23]Okay.
[86:28.37]Okay, I need your- I need your- No, no, no, no, no!
[86:32.63]I was gonna say, like, somebody has to be up there, because it'll fall off.
[86:35.81]Well, we could make it into, like, if it's high enough, we can make it into, like, just a ramp that we can walk up.
[86:40.17]Well, you see what just happened?
[86:41.71]The thing just weighs it down.
[86:44.06]Pretty much what we're saying is we got screwed by the master screwer.
[86:46.84]The master scrooge.
[86:48.36]You can do this?
[86:49.58]You got screwed by master scrooge.
[86:52.14]Aren't you gonna feel good when you figure it out?
[86:55.75]No, not too much, too much.
[86:56.73]And you're saying just to stick it up there.
[86:57.88]Make it like a midpoint where we can just jump and grab on and then use that thing.
[87:01.88]Alright, so like that.
[87:02.62]That looks pretty good.
[87:04.40]Come on, guys.
[87:04.72]This is just like Dark Souls.
[87:10.20]Hold on.
[87:12.94]I'm going to hold this for you.
[87:14.32]Wait, wait, wait.
[87:14.86]Use this.
[87:16.28]I need you to help me.
[87:17.62]My arm is broken behind and I can't do anything about it.
[87:20.56]I'm serious.
[87:21.15]Could you, like, help me here?
[87:23.46]I'm grabbing myself in the back of the head.
[87:24.72]I'm doing like a Jim Carrey bit.
[87:25.96]Okay, there we go.
[87:29.81]Alright, so I'm going to lift this up.
[87:35.57]Oh wait, actually if you, uh... Hmm.
[87:38.05]Yeah, you wedge it in there right, it might... See, it's too heavy.
[87:45.07]You like what you see back here?
[87:46.35]Hold on, wait.
[87:46.89]Just stand on the end of this.
[87:49.61]Can I cartoon you?
[87:52.80]I mean, you would have to have at least a three times as heavy obstacle.
[87:57.22]Alright, can you go from there?
[88:01.66]Watch out.
[88:03.95]Okay, hold on.
[88:06.63]Welcome to what I was trying to do 30 seconds ago.
[88:08.91]Alright, so just... Why did it work so much better for you than it did for me?
[88:14.83]Hold on, I'm not up there yet.
[88:15.87]Let me swing.
[88:18.77]I want my friends.
[88:19.67]Where are my friends?
[88:20.89]Well, about that...
[88:22.79]You can't say, where are my friends, after actively sabotaging your friends.
[88:26.59]I didn't... I didn't know.
[88:28.61]Where are my friends?
[88:30.51]Oh, maybe it's where... Maybe I know where they are when I actively fucking sabotaged them five minutes ago.
[88:35.99]I didn't know.
[88:40.91]Now we need to do the lift train.
[88:43.11]Yeah.
[88:44.13]Yeah.
[88:45.45]Grab him a pallet.
[88:46.76]I got him.
[88:50.86]Okay.
[88:52.01]How does that work so consistently?
[88:54.18]It's always how we solve every puzzle.
[88:56.00]Alright, now can we go to the slide?
[88:57.00]Now we can go to the slide.
[88:59.72]Thank God.
[89:00.48]Finally.
[89:01.36]It's all I wanted to do.
[89:02.28]Alright, I did the push and pull thing wrong.
[89:08.16]It's okay.
[89:08.54]Thank you.
[89:10.66]You guys ignored the slide?
[89:13.10]Well, you have to go up top, right?
[89:16.16]Looks like it.
[89:16.82]Wait for me.
[89:20.34]Wait for me.
[89:20.78]Wait for me.
[89:21.28]Wait for me.
[89:21.92]Actually, you know what?
[89:23.50]Fuck him.
[89:25.06]Wait for me.
[89:26.08]No, you like me.
[89:26.98]Wait for me, he says.
[89:28.31]We should sabotage him right now.
[89:29.81]I waited for you.
[89:30.61]Oh, let go.
[89:33.07]Let go.
[89:34.35]Let go.
[89:34.91]Just let go.
[89:36.35]This is homicide.
[89:37.43]This is a homicide.
[89:38.83]Yeah, it sure is.
[89:40.18]Alright, I can't.
[89:43.70]I'm trying to push you both off.
[89:47.12]With the Donkey Kong barrel.
[89:48.30]Alright, but is Diddy Kong gonna come out of this?
[89:50.30]Alright, I'm gonna push the barrel down the slide.
[89:53.79]Wait, what's the point?
[89:54.69]I don't know.
[89:55.43]But hey, it was in the right spot!
[89:57.79]Sorry.
[89:59.01]I don't know what came over me.
[90:00.23]Let go!
[90:00.77]Hey!
[90:03.39]No, that's gonna be turned.
[90:07.74]I don't get it.
[90:11.45]Uh-oh.
[90:12.69]Start over.
[90:14.37]Alright, you do it then.
[90:16.01]Oh my god, I'm falling.
[90:17.11]Alright, push it off.
[90:20.31]Nice!
[90:24.33]Uh... My turn.
[90:26.65]Huh.
[90:28.70]But what's the point?
[90:29.66]Well, it was fun.
[90:30.92]Is there a point?
[90:34.68]I don't think so.
[90:35.98]I'll try to catch it.
[90:37.00]Oh my fucking god, I'm so, so bad at this.
[90:43.57]I don't even pay attention to where my fucking feet are.
[90:45.33]No, do it again.
[90:50.19]Alright, I'm going to ride with this thing.
[90:57.56]Uh-oh.
[90:59.16]I think we actually do need that.
[91:00.32]I hope that falls in the water.
[91:02.70]I'm pretty sure we don't.
[91:04.90]There's another thing we could go do.
[91:06.50]I think we need it for the ledge.
[91:07.78]Because there's a ledge over here we can't grab without it.
[91:15.26]Raw strength right there.
[91:16.90]We're going down.
[91:21.66]Getting on this thing.
[91:23.18]Your arm will break in half.
[91:24.62]Get on the thing.
[91:25.68]Get on the slide.
[91:26.50]Hold on.
[91:26.81]I'm going.
[91:27.19]Alright.
[91:28.55]Get on the slide.
[91:30.09]Now what?
[91:33.15]Am I supposed to jump over this?
[91:39.07]I need to get out of the way.
[91:40.65]Yeah.
[91:41.69]No, I can't.
[91:42.19]What if I lie down?
[91:43.51]Can you just do it over me?
[91:51.50]I'm gonna get out.
[91:53.04]I got an achievement.
[91:54.60]Did you really?
[91:55.74]Yeah.
[91:55.92]Alright, I'm gonna get out of the way.
[91:59.75]American Gladiator Part 2!
[92:02.21]Can you make it up the warp wall?
[92:03.11]I bet you he can make it.
[92:05.55]Throw him something.
[92:06.67]Get the catapult on him.
[92:08.61]Get the catapult.
[92:09.99]Uh oh.
[92:12.55]Inch by inch.
[92:15.91]All my monkey training.
[92:17.23]I'm gonna get it.
[92:18.79]Let's actually get the barrel down there.
[92:20.67]I think we actually do need it.
[92:21.61]Hold on.
[92:24.93]I just had an epiphany.
[92:29.04]Well... You got up there from the house?
[92:33.24]I'm gonna help.
[92:33.58]Oh, you had an epiphany.
[92:34.74]What inspired this epiphany?
[92:36.63]Oh, no, that's not the epiphany.
[92:38.75]If you had one of the little Gandalf staffs, you could just slide across it with the hook.
[92:45.33]I just want it to be flat.
[92:47.54]Oh, you could actually.
[92:48.50]That's a pretty good epiphany.
[92:49.74]Thank you.
[92:50.64]Thank you.
[92:52.60]Guess what?
[92:53.76]I'm a monkey.
[92:54.46]I'm a monkey.
[92:55.76]Hey, come down here, somebody.
[92:57.14]I'm not a monkey.
[92:58.97]Not you, since you're literally halfway.
[93:01.07]Alright, it's over there.
[93:01.97]Come over here.
[93:02.91]Hold on, I did the thing.
[93:05.89]I'm fine.
[93:06.31]I'm going to be fine.
[93:08.93]Yeah.
[93:10.09]Okay.
[93:10.99]Whoa.
[93:11.47]I'm just going to do the slide.
[93:12.85]Now you're going to turn it up like this, right side up.
[93:21.22]Right side up, the damn thing.
[93:24.24]Can you help me?
[93:24.82]I'm having some problems.
[93:26.94]It needs to be right side up.
[93:28.64]I mean, you could probably make that.
[93:29.86]No!
[93:30.90]Did you fall?
[93:32.14]No, I can't see.
[93:32.78]There's nothing in here!
[93:35.29]No, it needs to be right side up.
[93:36.39]You just have to spin it.
[93:36.98]Alright, right side up.
[93:39.16]Okay, now pick it up.
[93:40.06]Easy.
[93:40.80]I got one side, you get the other.
[93:41.80]What the fuck?
[93:43.74]Alright, I'll let it go.
[93:45.04]Okay.
[93:45.32]Yeah.
[93:46.52]See?
[93:47.42]One at a time.
[93:47.98]It's that easy.
[93:50.30]Nice and easy.
[93:50.80]I didn't go up yet.
[93:51.38]You said one at a time.
[93:52.14]Alex!
[94:00.98]Why you...
[94:09.14]Now into there?
[94:11.74]Yeah, okay.
[94:13.42]We did the right way.
[94:14.03]Where is he?
[94:15.73]How do we get out of there?
[94:16.65]Not really.
[94:21.31]Where is he?
[94:25.39]Oh my god, you could have skipped this whole thing.
[94:37.50]by what going above no I don't even want to talk about it I just don't even want to talk about it it's what I was trying to do before and I skipped because this looked more fun so how this is incorrect we could go out this one you have to jump out the window and go to the right there's like you can come back all the way I open the door you know it's fine it's fine it's oh it's fine I'm up there
[95:05.76]I'm almost at the bonfire.
[95:07.26]Holy shit!
[95:08.08]I almost fell off.
[95:08.80]Okay.
[95:10.02]Couch.
[95:10.39]Couch.
[95:11.49]Not the opportunity.
[95:12.97]Hold on.
[95:13.57]Alright.
[95:13.97]I see you gearing up for a jump.
[95:15.45]Just wiggle it out.
[95:16.59]Nice hula.
[95:17.99]Okay.
[95:21.11]Oh boy.
[95:21.29]There's still more.
[95:22.65]I'll wait.
[95:23.43]It's really up the platform ante right now.
[95:26.31]I'll wait.
[95:27.47]What am I grabbing onto?
[95:28.64]I'll wait.
[95:29.14]Okay.
[95:33.32]Now up in here.
[95:36.13]Oh, you guys got up there with the barrel.
[95:37.65]I see what you did.
[95:38.37]That was much easier than what I did.
[95:40.64]I don't know why you did that.
[95:41.54]Are you at the bell?
[95:44.00]Did you already do the bell?
[95:45.54]I'm at the door.
[95:46.90]I opened the door.
[95:47.98]Did you, like, zipline to the bell?
[95:51.30]What?
[95:51.54]What are you talking about?
[95:52.77]We have a really cool thing to do.
[95:54.37]Oh, up that way?
[95:54.79]No, there's something really cool potentially up here.
[95:58.67]Yeah, we're going to do the fun thing.
[96:00.65]I almost just fell off.
[96:03.05]Right when you said it.
[96:03.71]The second you said it.
[96:05.45]Okay.
[96:05.71]This is a... Oh, no.
[96:07.09]Metallics.
[96:07.77]We got to be very, very careful here.
[96:10.53]Both of us have to go at the same time, too.
[96:12.25]This is the thing I was wanting to do.
[96:13.49]So you got to get the end.
[96:14.21]And we got to hook this and then jump off.
[96:16.71]Alright.
[96:20.79]I can't see up, so you have to guide me.
[96:25.27]We're not on it.
[96:26.09]We are not... I got to get lower.
[96:27.65]Hold on.
[96:28.07]Hold it.
[96:29.24]I'm lower.
[96:29.80]You go higher.
[96:30.66]I'm lower.
[96:31.06]No, we almost got it.
[96:31.94]I'm as low as it goes.
[96:33.38]I got the ground shot.
[96:35.28]It's almost there.
[96:35.74]Alright, it's on, it's on.
[96:38.66]It's on, it's on.
[96:39.62]Okay, now just pull it back.
[96:41.23]Now we have to... Okay, hold on.
[96:42.75]We have to jump off the side.
[96:44.39]Alright, you... No, no, no.
[96:46.03]You guide this.
[96:47.23]I'm going to hold on to you.
[96:49.17]I just got you back.
[96:49.81]I have to jump.
[96:50.49]It's okay.
[96:50.87]It's going to...
[96:52.70]I'm gonna wait you down.
[96:53.52]No, no.
[96:53.66]You gotta grab higher up.
[96:54.84]Grab higher up.
[96:55.48]No, no.
[96:55.95]Absolutely not.
[96:56.49]Because it'll come undone.
[96:58.17]You just get off.
[96:58.71]Get out of here.
[96:59.29]You just jump off.
[97:00.51]But if I jump, it's going to unseat it from the wire.
[97:03.67]Okay.
[97:03.79]Here's what's gonna happen.
[97:04.43]You're gonna jump and I'm gonna be the weight back here.
[97:06.29]In case you fuck it up, I'll pull you back.
[97:08.43]Okay.
[97:08.71]You ready?
[97:09.26]Hang on.
[97:10.28]Let it go.
[97:10.66]Let it get a little bit of distance.
[97:11.64]Got some slack.
[97:13.40]You're holding me up like a little baby.
[97:15.50]I know.
[97:15.82]Alright.
[97:16.20]So let me hold you up then.
[97:18.40]Oh no.
[97:18.90]It's not gonna work.
[97:21.20]It is funny to listen to without context.
[97:24.66]It's on there now.
[97:26.19]Alright, go.
[97:29.35]We're good.
[97:30.03]It's on.
[97:30.49]It's on.
[97:30.77]Just walk off.
[97:31.83]It's not on anymore!
[97:35.79]You fucking turd sniffers.
[97:39.12]Where are we?
[97:42.42]It was not on at all.
[97:43.92]I'm not even over there and I could tell you that.
[97:48.08]Fuck!
[97:49.46]No!
[97:49.62]We have to do that!
[97:51.32]Oh, goddammit!
[97:52.50]No, it's so much fun!
[97:55.90]Drop this in the ocean.
[97:57.00]Just drop- jump in the ocean.
[97:58.18]Well, actually, then what the hell is over here?
[98:00.05]Where do you end up?
[98:00.61]Tell me.
[98:02.75]Oh, no.
[98:04.59]I just opened this door.
[98:05.89]Let's jump in and let's do door.
[98:07.71]No, no, no.
[98:08.87]All three of us, get up there.
[98:10.79]Right now, to your room.
[98:12.51]We're doing that.
[98:13.95]Get back up there.
[98:15.69]Yes, dad.
[98:18.09]Is there a way I can get up here?
[98:22.91]I don't know.
[98:23.41]You tell me.
[98:24.67]Well, don't we have to, like, bring a whole other hook up there?
[98:27.23]No, it respawns.
[98:28.23]We threw it in the water.
[98:35.45]Yes, Dad.
[98:36.47]How have I messed this up already?
[98:40.15]This is like going to the Grand Canyon as a kid.
[98:42.47]You really don't want to stare at a mountain thingy.
[98:47.55]There's no point to this.
[98:49.34]No, it's gonna be so fun.
[98:50.66]You have no idea how fun this is gonna be.
[98:52.30]Oh, when we get to the Grand Rapids?
[98:53.88]Just wait till we get to the Rapids.
[98:56.10]You'll have tons of fun.
[98:56.68]I wanna do the zipline, Mom.
[99:00.04]The zipline's too dangerous.
[99:04.52]Hey, you messed up the barrel.
[99:06.05]I'm almost there, slowly but surely.
[99:08.67]Yeah, me too.
[99:13.97]What the hell?
[99:15.47]How did you even mess this up?
[99:19.86]ResidentSleeper.
[99:22.22]We're trying.
[99:24.04]I'm almost there.
[99:24.82]I don't want to lose it.
[99:28.92]Oh, am I there yet?
[99:30.24]I'm so close.
[99:31.74]One more.
[99:36.10]Where's the hook?
[99:37.04]Oh, God.
[99:37.72]Oh, no.
[99:38.34]Is the hook not there?
[99:39.00]Where does the hook spawn?
[99:40.97]The hook should spawn at the very top.
[99:42.79]Yeah, the hook should be there.
[99:43.57]Okay, boys, you know what time it is.
[99:47.87]It's time for the Monkey King.
[99:52.62]Shit.
[99:52.98]I need a little bit more space.
[99:53.94]I don't think I have enough space.
[99:56.84]I need to do it from here.
[99:59.54]So are you trying to catch up to where I... Where are you?
[100:01.80]I'm climbing up the whole thing.
[100:03.44]Oh, this ain't gonna work, man.
[100:04.68]Oh, this is not gonna work.
[100:05.52]I have to go over here.
[100:09.80]Don't fall off the edge.
[100:16.13]God damn it.
[100:18.29]There's no hook.
[100:19.73]The hook's not up there?
[100:21.61]No.
[100:22.81]That's why I had to Monkey King it.
[100:26.05]How did you get up there?
[100:26.95]What?
[100:27.55]The hook should... Are you guys in the right place?
[100:30.42]I climbed to the top of the tower.
[100:31.58]There was no hook.
[100:32.90]There should be a hook right next to the cable.
[100:35.76]There was not.
[100:36.92]Well, it came down with us and I threw it into the ocean to try to respawn it.
[100:41.71]Okay, because what I was hearing was it definitely respawns.
[100:45.13]It has to.
[100:47.58]I mean, I can go up there and Monkey King it again, but there's no point, and we should just go through that door.
[100:52.04]I'm almost there.
[100:54.58]How did you even get up there so fast?
[100:57.01]Because I am a super pogchamper.
[101:08.23]Okay, not so bad.
[101:09.89]It's still there, look.
[101:10.45]Did you miss it?
[101:12.37]It's in the water.
[101:13.73]It's in the water.
[101:14.51]I...
[101:17.26]How?
[101:17.64]Oh, is it?
[101:18.22]Let me look.
[101:18.92]Can you just, like, move it?
[101:20.40]Just throw it back?
[101:21.26]I didn't see it in there.
[101:24.00]I don't know what people are talking about.
[101:25.20]It is.
[101:27.28]So, get it in there.
[101:28.20]I need to jump off the edge.
[101:29.62]It's still in the water.
[101:31.40]So, get it.
[101:35.10]There's only, like, one piece of it still in the water.
[101:37.62]Here we go.
[101:37.96]Speedrun Monkey King.
[101:41.12]Now I have the leverage here.
[101:42.32]Run up, run up.
[101:46.16]Why would it get stuck there, though?
[101:53.30]I gotta make some progress.
[101:54.33]Come on.
[101:56.47]I could reset the checkpoint.
[101:59.41]Yeah.
[102:00.41]Just do that.
[102:00.85]What are you doing?
[102:01.93]You resetting?
[102:02.95]No.
[102:04.58]No.
[102:04.74]I'm like almost up there again.
[102:08.42]You're gonna be able to see me struggling.
[102:11.31]Well then, I got an idea.
[102:13.45]I might need somebody to help them.
[102:14.89]This is going to take me forever.
[102:16.75]The irony is going to be palpable.
[102:19.41]20 minutes.
[102:19.77]This isn't a joke.
[102:20.97]This is what they want to do with their day.
[102:22.61]This is what everyone wants to see happen.
[102:24.73]Yeah.
[102:25.19]Someone hitting the bell.
[102:26.69]I mean, the joke can already happen.
[102:27.55]It'll be so great when the bell gets rung.
[102:29.10]And then Siege comes out.
[102:31.90]I don't care.
[102:33.40]I'm done.
[102:34.10]I'm done.
[102:34.40]I'm out.
[102:34.66]I'm out of there.
[102:36.14]No, I'm not.
[102:36.48]Why did I respond?
[102:39.99]What?
[102:40.95]I'm at the top again.
[102:41.91]Hey, look what I got.
[102:43.09]Why can't I... Let me up there.
[102:47.38]Let me up there, game.
[102:48.16]Why?
[102:48.50]I can't make it up here.
[102:56.50]Hey, look what I got.
[102:57.52]Fuck it.
[102:57.84]I'm going off the edge.
[103:04.49]Did you get it?
[103:07.03]Where the hell am I now?
[103:10.61]Where did I end up?
[103:18.88]Oh, no.
[103:19.26]You guys are up there?
[103:20.02]No.
[103:22.36]He's up there.
[103:23.74]He's up there.
[103:24.53]No, but I want to see him.
[103:27.03]Come on.
[103:29.43]I want to watch him.
[103:31.40]Watch me from the ground like a peasant.
[103:33.48]I wanna see- I'm fine.
[103:37.70]That was a good opera number.
[103:39.74]Can I hear it again?
[103:44.64]No, you don't have the tool.
[103:47.58]That's not cool without the tool.
[103:48.50]I'm sorry, my tools!
[103:49.44]I need my tools!
[103:50.41]That's not cool without the tool.
[103:52.42]Guys, hold these two.
[103:53.28]Oh, sorry, this isn't... Sorry, I wasted all my time to get up here when I already confirmed there was no tool like fucking ten minutes ago, and now that I'm doing it, it's not cool.
[104:01.84]Well, you have the tool, right?
[104:04.78]The tool's been in our hearts all along.
[104:07.52]The tool's been in the call all along.
[104:09.07]Is this actually physically possible to do, or are we wasting all the time?
[104:12.79]Hey, look at me.
[104:13.25]What are you doing with that?
[104:18.97]I don't know how to get it over there, though.
[104:20.43]Just shimmy it around.
[104:21.45]I can pull you.
[104:26.28]Wait, where are you?
[104:27.16]I'm currently over here.
[104:28.80]Doing the thing that we did before.
[104:30.14]Okay.
[104:32.60]No, no.
[104:32.78]Don't fall, don't fall, don't fall, don't fall, don't fall.
[104:35.82]Don't fall.
[104:37.01]Don't do it.
[104:37.39]I feel like the true Monkey King needs to go across, up to that high one.
[104:40.77]I hope.
[104:41.19]I can't wait until you fall in the last hand.
[104:42.97]The last hand.
[104:44.15]You can't throw that to me, can you?
[104:47.11]Don't fucking eat my ass.
[104:48.53]Yeah.
[104:49.29]Not the game, not you guys.
[104:51.28]Yeah.
[104:51.72]Good.
[104:52.50]You're almost there.
[104:53.24]Alright, I need somebody to go...
[104:56.43]Where I can hand this off to them.
[104:58.07]Alright.
[104:58.47]Hold on.
[104:58.93]Hold on.
[105:00.23]Stay there.
[105:00.67]I am going to be hanging on for some time to come.
[105:05.06]I'm in the window.
[105:06.82]Stay there.
[105:07.30]Oh, I got to pull you through the window, don't I?
[105:09.08]No, no, no.
[105:09.56]You have to go up.
[105:13.21]I'm going to try not to knock you off.
[105:14.85]I can't just pull you through?
[105:16.61]No, because we have to go up.
[105:18.11]Oh, God.
[105:18.55]Okay.
[105:18.81]Stay there.
[105:22.15]So you need to go to, like, the highest step.
[105:24.83]Do you guys really understand that there's no point to this?
[105:27.21]Is there?
[105:28.17]I mean, is there a point to anything that we do?
[105:31.31]Is there a point to any of this?
[105:34.06]Real, like, nihilistic stuff.
[105:36.56]I mean, is there even a point?
[105:38.56]Why did it double jump?
[105:39.42]I'm fine.
[105:39.66]Everyone calm down.
[105:40.20]We're playing, like, a physics-based video game.
[105:42.44]Are we trying to win?
[105:43.40]I am.
[105:44.98]Are we just playing, like, a funny physics game?
[105:47.40]No, I'm playing to win.
[105:50.12]Oh, fuck me.
[105:50.79]I can't believe it.
[105:54.27]Okay, I'm in.
[105:55.43]I'm about to go all the way up.
[105:56.45]So where are you?
[105:57.25]Is that your stick?
[105:58.68]Ding.
[106:00.08]Ding.
[106:00.24]Alright, come out the window that you came in.
[106:01.68]Am I supposed to reach you from here?
[106:03.62]Come out the window that I came in.
[106:05.46]Ding.
[106:07.34]Okay, I can see your little snake.
[106:10.17]I got the snake.
[106:11.27]Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[106:12.55]You got it?
[106:13.15]I mean, I got it.
[106:14.49]Okay, now let go.
[106:17.63]Okay.
[106:19.37]Okay, I got it.
[106:19.81]It's up here.
[106:21.15]Alright.
[106:21.75]Got it?
[106:21.99]Next step.
[106:22.98]We're almost there, Stark.
[106:23.70]Come on.
[106:26.43]I really just want to finish the whole level and ruin it for you, but I... Alright, you go up there.
[106:32.46]I didn't even get an achievement.
[106:36.12]Now how do we do it from here?
[106:37.32]We're almost up there.
[106:38.38]You got it?
[106:39.46]Don't let go.
[106:43.91]It's safe.
[106:44.45]We did it.
[106:45.51]And you didn't think we were going to do it.
[106:47.01]We have to go up the winding stairs.
[106:48.57]I'm just going to hold it.
[106:49.79]You just get up there in case there's an issue.
[106:51.33]How are you walking faster than me?
[106:53.78]I don't know.
[106:58.71]Actually, no, no, no, let's do this correct.
[107:00.35]Dude, you get the top.
[107:01.17]I'll get the bottom.
[107:02.28]We need to be very careful with this thing.
[107:04.82]Here, here.
[107:05.32]We need to be on the other side.
[107:06.90]Yeah, we both need to be on the same side, so on the inside.
[107:10.90]We need to be on the drop, the fall to our death.
[107:14.12]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[107:14.78]Stop, stop, stop.
[107:15.24]Okay.
[107:16.36]I'm good.
[107:16.92]Now shimmy up here.
[107:19.08]You're falling off.
[107:19.80]You're about to fall off.
[107:21.14]I'm pulling back as hard as I can right now.
[107:26.25]It's like, ah, goddammit, lady, you had to order the big sofa and a tiny fucking house.
[107:30.11]Yeah, just... It's just the moving company simulator.
[107:35.40]It's not that difficult.
[107:37.10]Me and my grandson got it up there.
[107:40.78]Oh, my hands are actually sweating right now.
[107:43.07]Don't, don't, easy, slow.
[107:49.35]How much further is it?
[107:50.95]The wind is blowing me, I think.
[107:51.99]I think the wind's blowing me.
[107:52.87]I'm freaking out.
[107:53.75]I don't know.
[107:54.67]I'm freaking out right now, though.
[107:56.11]Okay, easy.
[107:57.47]We're there.
[107:59.18]No, don't let go!
[107:59.76]Don't let go!
[108:00.26]Hook it!
[108:00.78]Hook it on something!
[108:01.84]Hook it on something!
[108:03.36]Star!
[108:03.98]Star, get back in now!
[108:05.50]Star, you have to get back in right now.
[108:07.82]I'm not gonna move.
[108:09.04]Star, you have to get back in now!
[108:12.59]Star!
[108:13.77]How?
[108:14.31]The whole way!
[108:14.87]You want me to go the whole way?
[108:16.37]You gotta go the whole way.
[108:19.76]Where are you?
[108:20.54]Just don't move.

[108:22.38]Just come back!
[108:23.34]Oh my god.
[108:24.84]I've been standing here waiting.
[108:26.72]You can come back.
[108:27.36]I can't move.
[108:28.50]As long as we don't move, you have to come back and you have to pull this up.
[108:34.49]Do I?
[108:34.97]Nobody pretends you do.
[108:36.45]This has been like 35 minutes.
[108:38.01]You have to do this.
[108:41.15]Wait, wait, wait.
[108:42.23]What if I let go?
[108:43.72]If I let go, that's the wait, right?

[109:30.90]Let's go.
[109:32.44]Hey, is that your belly button on your face?
[109:35.86]It's such a disaster.
[109:36.98]All for nothing.
[109:38.12]I already made that joke.
[109:39.77]I don't think anyone else has noticed.
[109:41.79]People think that's an eye.
[109:43.01]Oh, God.
[109:43.63]Well, is it your belly button?
[109:44.57]His belly button's on my belly.
[109:45.57]Yeah, that isn't an eye.
[109:47.03]That's my eye.
[109:47.57]Oh, yeah, his real belly button.
[109:48.75]His real stomach is his belly button.
[109:50.33]Yeah, that's my real... Yeah.
[109:51.78]Look, you can still get this thing.
[109:54.90]It's a lost cause.
[109:55.94]No, don't throw me off.
[109:57.02]What did I do to deserve that?
[110:00.19]You just did a lot.
[110:01.19]You did a lot.
[110:02.59]You let go.
[110:03.57]You let go.
[110:06.13]I let go.

[110:13.39]One of you guys decide.
[110:14.67]Okay, they're calling us quitters.
[110:17.19]Star, they're calling us quitters.
[110:18.25]I touched the bell already.
[110:19.47]They're calling us quitters.
[110:20.39]We did it.
[110:21.26]You get the credit because you're on my team.
[110:23.72]They're calling us quitters.
[110:24.66]We gotta go back.
[110:25.20]No, no.
[110:25.46]I'm not letting you back.
[110:26.76]No, we have to go back.
[110:27.40]I can't get by me.
[110:27.82]I'm not letting you back.
[110:28.44]I'm not letting you back.
[110:30.16]I just need someone to come take it.
[110:31.38]I'm coming.
[110:32.10]Please.
[110:32.38]They're calling me a quitter in my chat.

[111:14.34]You just needed one person to rescue.
[111:16.46]If I help you, is it really you doing it?
[111:18.34]Yes.
[111:18.68]Because I've already done it.
[111:19.72]Because you... We all have to slide down.
[111:21.84]Don't you understand?
[111:23.62]This is like a funny, local, fun co-op video.

[111:57.71]As long as you do it at the same time, we're going to be fine.
[112:03.78]What are you giggling at over there?
[112:06.32]Me?
[112:06.50]Etalyx, yeah.
[112:07.64]I sniffled my nose.
[112:09.32]Do I need permission to blow my nose, mommy?
[112:11.72]I heard like a little laugh.
[112:13.50]You do.
[112:13.72]You do.
[112:14.84]I thought you were laughing at me.
[112:17.78]No, I'm laughing at the fact that I'm somehow doing this on my own.
[112:20.78]Oh, well, I was.
[112:22.20]Okay, I don't... I'm rushing, and I can't rush.
[112:26.70]My one leg, though.
[112:32.24]Okay, I'm in the window.
[112:35.60]No, not over there.
[112:36.56]I'm on the wall.
[112:37.74]What do you mean, on the wall?
[112:40.37]I'm on the wall with...
[112:43.17]Huh?

[112:50.24]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[112:52.78]Where are you?
[112:55.45]Okay, if you look out the window that you jump into the tower in... Oh, I think I see you.
[113:00.19]Where the fuck are you?
[113:01.33]Look to your right.
[113:03.65]Along the wall.
[113:09.02]What?
[113:11.97]Oh, I see you.
[113:12.57]I see you.
[113:12.85]I see you.
[113:15.45]Are you all the way down there?
[113:16.33]I can't get you from here.
[113:17.35]I thought you were at the base of this wall.
[113:23.10]No, that's not it.
[113:23.82]This is impossible.
[113:25.20]It's not impossible.
[113:26.34]You have to hand that to me.
[113:27.94]I can pass it up.
[113:29.09]I've been getting it this far by myself.
[113:30.79]Alright, where's Star?
[113:33.87]Is he, like, muted, hanging out with these chat?
[113:36.03]I, I, yeah.
[113:36.53]I'm, I need to, you need to do this yourself.
[113:39.65]No!
[113:39.99]I'm just gonna hang out and wait for you.
[113:41.59]Okay.
[113:42.11]Alright, Etalyx, let's go.
[113:42.83]Three, two, one, go.
[113:44.29]We have to do this now.
[113:46.27]Pass it to me.
[113:48.07]But don't let go, though, because if you let go... Oh, God.
[113:51.93]Do I got it?
[113:52.36]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[113:53.14]No, that's the stairs.
[113:54.58]I'm gonna come down a little bit.
[113:55.54]Alright, pass it up through there.
[113:58.94]Hold on.
[114:00.64]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[114:01.68]Forward.
[114:03.52]That's as far as it goes.
[114:04.44]That's as far as it goes?
[114:05.82]Hold on, I'll just stay there.
[114:08.56]Do I got it?
[114:09.44]Okay, I think I got it.
[114:10.10]No, you got the wall.
[114:11.04]It's over.
[114:11.40]No, no, I got the wall.
[114:12.10]Hold on.
[114:14.93]Oh, nice again.
[114:16.11]It's the end.
[114:16.73]No.
[114:17.05]Start.
[114:17.31]Walk out.
[114:17.57]No.
[114:17.63]It's just a repeat.
[114:18.33]Start.
[114:18.55]Walk.
[114:18.87]Walk.
[114:19.11]Get out.
[114:19.57]Quick.
[114:19.75]I got it.
[114:20.11]I still have... No.
[114:20.81]Walk.
[114:21.01]Get out.
[114:21.85]Get us out of here.
[114:22.31]No.
[114:23.53]Walk out of the level.
[114:24.07]Quick.
[114:25.92]Where am I?
[114:26.46]No.
[114:27.40]Beat the thing.
[114:28.66]You're giving up.
[114:30.47]How could you not grab this?
[114:32.07]The stairs are, like, right... It was fucking going in my head and stuff.
[114:35.75]The wall was going into my head and glitching out.
[114:38.49]There was, like, half of the cane was up by the stairs.
[114:41.88]Are you giving up?
[114:42.52]Yeah, go.
[114:43.38]We have to get out of here.
[114:44.08]This is...
[114:48.29]That killed it.
[114:49.60]That's disappointing.
[114:50.40]I don't care if you call me a quitter.
[114:51.80]Like, this is going on way too long.
[114:54.10]If we had another person to come up there and fucking help us, maybe we wouldn't have that.
[114:57.86]I was on my way and then you fell off.
[115:00.14]How many times did you guys fall off and you're going to blame me?
[115:02.39]Oh, wait.
[115:02.75]Did you just say we had to do it ourselves?
[115:06.97]You just told us like 10 minutes ago.
[115:08.61]I am not going to talk to you for another fucking year.
[115:14.70]Alright.
[115:15.44]End the level.
[115:16.60]End the level.
[115:18.94]Where's the end?
[115:20.18]Where's the end of the level?
[115:23.16]I'm trying to beat it.
[115:24.84]Mom, Dad, stop.
[115:27.10]There's loud noises coming from your room.
[115:30.34]Where's the end?
[115:32.46]Is everyone okay, Mom?
[115:34.08]You need to get on the top of this.
[115:40.82]Do it.
[115:41.86]Do it.
[115:42.20]I made it.
[115:47.28]Did I?
[115:47.76]So sweaty.
[115:48.66]I think my controller just turned off.
[115:55.46]I am so sweaty, too.
[115:56.46]I'm like, it's too hot.
[115:58.38]It's too hot for this shit.
[115:59.80]It is very hot.
[116:02.12]I'm wearing a rag.
[116:03.81]Disconnected?
[116:07.91]Did you get disconnected?
[116:09.77]No, I was saying, is this log connected?
[116:15.47]Oh, no, you've got to fling yourself the whole way.
[116:17.03]What do you mean?
[116:17.69]Fling from where?
[116:18.61]From the windmill?
[116:19.95]Yeah.
[116:27.14]Easy.
[116:28.76]From the very end of the windmill.
[116:29.90]Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[116:33.09]Hold on.
[116:34.03]I can still do this.
[116:35.35]I would laugh so hard if you actually did it.
[116:38.96]If I could just, like, climb up this thing.
[116:40.90]Did I just call this thing an endmill?
[116:41.86]Kiss me on the lips.
[116:42.56]Kiss me on the lips.
[116:43.58]Kiss me on the lips.
[116:44.80]I just gotta get the endmill.
[116:52.61]I mean, it's technically possible.
[116:54.89]Technically.
[116:57.29]Gotta wait till I can grab here.
[117:03.04]So all the way at the end of the windmill, huh?
[117:07.35]As it comes up, you just let go.
[117:09.81]And it flings you across.
[117:11.43]Like up on the ascent here, let go.
[117:13.09]They're just gonna walk through it any moment.
[117:18.30]Nice.
[117:18.68]Now you gotta bring the... The spool?
[117:21.90]You gotta... I actually don't know what any of that is.
[117:26.02]All I know is that we need something to load the catapult properly.
[117:29.96]I have a piece of wood here.
[117:31.14]Wait, no, we don't.
[117:32.08]We don't need something.
[117:32.98]What happened to me?
[117:35.03]I get it.
[117:35.53]I understand it all.
[117:36.30]Come to me.
[117:37.30]Come to me.
[117:38.70]Come to me.
[117:39.96]I can't.
[117:41.40]Why not?
[117:42.08]Because I went through the world.
[117:43.76]Oh, there's a hole there.
[117:46.48]You fell in a hole.
[117:47.42]Yep.
[117:48.90]Come to me.
[117:49.56]I will eventually.
[117:55.22]I got the cane back up.
[117:59.23]Okay.
[118:00.27]Let me figure this out.
[118:02.56]Well, now there are three separate livestreams in three different locations.
[118:06.02]Come to me!
[118:06.50]Well, this is a good thing because multi-Twitch makes sense now.
[118:09.18]Yeah.
[118:11.10]Um... I'm in a cave.
[118:16.82]Okay, Star, when you get over there, don't open up that... There's a piece of wood on the ground.
[118:21.59]Underneath the wood is a giant hole that you will fall in.
[118:24.73]I'm not going up there.
[118:25.87]That's pointless to me.
[118:26.87]You're worthless.
[118:28.63]Well, maybe you're worthless.
[118:30.57]And you're projecting on me.
[118:33.33]I would never do that.
[118:33.99]You think about that?
[118:34.83]Alright, I'm... I can't lift this anymore.
[118:39.23]I'm just looking at my own ass.
[118:42.11]I need help.
[118:44.84]I'm in a different zone.
[118:46.26]I don't need your help.
[118:50.64]Fuck me.
[118:52.42]I would.
[118:55.20]I gotta watch what I say around you.
[118:58.51]Wait, there's a big boulder up here.
[119:03.80]What is this for?
[119:05.78]What?
[119:06.06]Do I have to roll this off or something?
[119:10.44]That's bad.
[119:13.19]That's really bad.
[119:14.17]I don't think I'm supposed to be here right now.
[119:16.27]What the fuck is this?
[119:22.41]Oh, no.
[119:23.17]There's another catapult over here.
[119:26.14]There's a second catapult.
[119:28.00]Oh, no.
[119:28.52]You're telling me we're going to get that?
[119:30.48]How do we get... Jerma, help!
[119:33.51]I don't think you understand.
[119:34.29]I'm not even close to where you are.
[119:35.42]Jerma, help.
[119:35.66]Jerma, help.
[119:35.96]Jerma, help.
[119:36.42]You're right below me.
[119:37.24]You don't hear this giant wood plank above you?
[119:39.54]Huh?
[119:43.76]Where are you?
[119:44.36]Help.
[119:48.41]Are you in the cave?
[119:49.81]You were down in the cave.
[119:50.73]Look towards the catapult.
[119:52.71]You see that wood plank?
[119:54.21]You see the wood plank?
[119:55.35]No, I went down because you said I'm down here.
[119:57.09]Turn back.
[119:58.15]Turn back.
[119:59.92]Turn back.
[120:01.42]Walk the other way.
[120:02.36]What are you talking about?
[120:03.06]You don't even know where I am.
[120:05.28]I know where you are!
[120:06.62]Alright, what is happening in the background?
[120:15.83]What's going on over here?
[120:16.91]Turn!
[120:19.65]Turn around.
[120:27.67]Oh, that was delicious to me.
[120:30.11]That was the most scrumptious thing I've had all week.
[120:37.34]Where are you?
[120:38.50]You guys, check the way to me too.
[120:39.82]I have no idea where you are.
[120:40.88]Okay, so you need to... Just turn around!
[120:43.42]What do you want me to do?
[120:45.64]You can't help anymore.
[120:46.44]I know where you are.
[120:47.36]I can see you.
[120:48.08]I can see you the whole fucking time.
[120:49.52]Proud of you.
[120:52.02]Hey, chat's scared right now.
[120:56.00]Okay, I know.
[120:57.84]Well, if they had on multi-Twitch, they'd understand.
[121:00.14]Alright, so that was knockdown.
[121:03.13]Thanks to me.
[121:05.87]There's a boulder here.
[121:06.79]So, okay, Etalyx.
[121:08.19]The windmill.
[121:09.99]You gotta ride the windmill over to, like, the grassy plain.
[121:14.57]And then there is a piece of wood or a hole.
[121:18.13]There's a hole in the ground under the piece of wood.
[121:20.83]And you just go down there.
[121:24.04]I think he'd listen to you.
[121:25.80]Do you want me to bring the boulder down there?
[121:28.21]You think he's listening to you?
[121:29.91]You knocked down the wrong one.
[121:31.03]What do you mean I knocked down the wrong one?
[121:34.25]I mean... Is there a right one?
[121:36.21]They both have to be knocked down for some reason.
[121:38.41]This is all new to me.
[121:40.07]Look, now you're fine.
[121:41.93]Now I have to get the boulder down there.
[121:43.03]Because then the boulder goes inside of that catapult.
[121:47.31]Is that correct?
[121:48.39]Come over here.
[121:49.14]Come over here.
[121:50.12]You don't need... Come over here.
[121:52.26]I'm flying over there now.
[121:53.46]Wait, Etalyx just flew.
[121:54.50]How?
[121:56.33]Wow.
[121:57.83]Vitalik's might... What's up?
[122:02.81]Okay, I'm here.
[122:03.54]Hold on.
[122:05.12]I can do this.
[122:08.10]You want help, Vitalik?
[122:10.00]Hang on.
[122:10.46]Grab the leg.
[122:13.78]Here.
[122:14.70]Grab it.
[122:16.08]Give me a chute.
[122:16.98]Give me a chute.
[122:17.72]Do you got my leg?
[122:18.30]Give me a chute!
[122:19.18]Okay.
[122:19.30]I do now.
[122:22.50]Nice.
[122:22.86]Okay, star.
[122:25.68]Yeah.
[122:26.08]Need you over here for just a second.
[122:27.43]Oh my god.
[122:27.79]Both hands.
[122:28.33]Put both hands into it.
[122:30.05]I am right now... This is a weird angle.
[122:37.62]Okay, we all up?
[122:39.12]Good.
[122:39.46]Yeah, we are.
[122:41.18]Don't fall off.
[122:41.98]We made it.
[122:42.62]Alright, now catapult me back up to the castle so I can go get the cane.
[122:47.95]No, get the cane out of here.
[122:51.14]So now what?
[122:52.68]Now pull it?
[122:53.86]I'm going in the tube.
[122:54.71]Let us know when you want us to pull it.
[122:57.39]He's going to pull it right now.
[122:58.99]Shoot him.
[123:02.91]Nice, okay.
[123:04.19]Now, perfect.
[123:06.39]Lower the bridge.
[123:07.17]We've got to move this out of the way.
[123:10.23]Pull this bag.
[123:12.35]I'm going to say I'm going to rescue you.
[123:14.37]I'm fine.
[123:15.29]I don't need you.
[123:16.13]I need the credit.
[123:18.43]I need the credit.
[123:23.67]Let go.
[123:24.03]Let go.
[123:25.99]You might need to catapult again.
[123:30.51]What?
[123:31.71]To get through the middle?
[123:34.31]You have to get catapulted into that little hole?
[123:36.78]Not into the hole, just above it so you can drop down into it.
[123:40.12]Oh, let's see.
[123:40.54]Let's go back.
[123:41.76]Let's wind the catapult.
[123:45.52]I'm going up top.
[123:50.83]I'm trying to do it.
[123:52.96]Stop using these weird terms.
[123:56.06]Like what?
[123:57.60]Oh, I don't know.
[123:59.10]The D word you just said?
[124:01.36]How many of your viewers call you daddy?
[124:03.45]Alright, I'm ready to go.
[124:08.37]I'll pull it myself, you fucking idiot.
[124:11.41]It's really hard to swing on this.
[124:13.90]If not impossible.
[124:15.18]Pull it.
[124:15.56]I can't.
[124:16.96]Pull it.
[124:24.33]Did you make it?
[124:24.99]No, you just have to climb through the hole.
[124:27.85]You just have to do the aggro crack.
[124:29.19]Alright, climb on me.
[124:32.52]I'll drop down.
[124:34.06]No, climb on my head.
[124:43.28]You're almost there.
[124:44.70]Can we just push him up?
[124:46.38]No, climb on me.
[124:49.16]We're like the same height.
[124:50.08]No, just grab him by the legs and push him up.
[124:53.70]Just push him up.
[124:56.80]Make sure you have a piece of him.
[124:58.22]Push him in the air.
[125:00.58]That's not going to work.
[125:01.60]Alright, new idea.
[125:04.14]New idea is he's going to swing back and forth in the grab.
[125:06.10]No, new idea we just push the catapult there and then climb up the catapult.
[125:09.94]That might work.
[125:11.56]The catapult's kind of stuck on us.
[125:13.69]Oh, no.
[125:16.89]What about over here?
[125:17.47]Hold on.
[125:20.19]Okay, I think there's a secret way to go.
[125:23.97]This game has no secrets.
[125:25.81]This looks kind of secret.
[125:27.11]No, this game has no secrets.
[125:29.37]Never mind.
[125:34.23]So we're gonna push the catapult in?
[125:35.37]No, I'm doing a launch.
[125:37.98]You're gonna try to go from there.
[125:40.32]Hey, could you stop cursing me with your Comcast voodoo, please?
[125:43.02]Hey, by the way, don't wind the catapult up all the way.
[125:46.44]Just launch me.
[125:48.28]No, it's too tight.
[125:49.61]Do it!
[125:55.65]Don't wind it up all the way.
[125:57.75]I moved the catapult back so you can wind it up all the way.
[126:00.37]Don't you understand?
[126:01.37]Have you ever used a catapult before in your life?
[126:03.63]I've used several.
[126:05.29]So now get in there, Etalyx.
[126:11.05]It's over.
[126:12.07]It's over.
[126:12.53]The whole thing.
[126:13.13]It's all over.
[126:13.69]Alright.
[126:15.63]Next level.
[126:16.29]This one looks way more elaborate.
[126:19.07]That level was actually huge compared to the intro ones.
[126:23.15]Are we, is everyone floating or is it just me?
[126:25.45]I think, uh, I think... Boaty time!
[126:27.99]Boaty time!
[126:28.91]Boaty time!
[126:30.63]Uh-oh.
[126:32.37]I'm hearing robotic.
[126:33.73]No, you're getting comcasted.
[126:35.35]Yeah, you're getting comcasted.
[126:36.43]Yeah, I am comcasted.
[126:38.59]We're getting comcasted.
[126:40.31]Someone help!
[126:43.07]We'll call Ro to save him.
[126:44.53]Which one do you want?
[126:46.79]You should just get both.
[126:51.09]Okay.
[126:51.25]Okay.
[126:56.94]Okay.
[126:59.76]Okay.
[127:00.18]I don't think you understand.
[127:02.26]This is not easy.
[127:03.48]I think I have to log back in.
[127:08.83]Am I robot still?
[127:10.19]No, not anymore.
[127:12.47]I have to load back in.
[127:15.03]No, I'm trying to turn it.
[127:15.77]I'm trying to turn it around.
[127:18.73]I think we just need to get to this island and take that raft to that motorboat.
[127:22.79]Okay, so spin it around?
[127:27.42]Uh-oh.
[127:28.66]Well, that was weird.
[127:31.15]And we're back.
[127:32.47]My whole screen froze.
[127:34.55]Yeah, when someone joins, it does that.
[127:36.13]Oh, okay.
[127:39.49]I'm gonna let go.
[127:41.11]He needs to get in here, though.
[127:47.56]This is really weird.
[127:48.56]Oh, he's gone.
[127:53.52]I can almost make it.
[127:54.68]We need two people, though.
[127:55.62]One on each.
[127:56.14]Alright.
[127:56.74]You gotta go back, because he can't get over here.
[127:59.17]I'm gonna lean over the boat.
[128:00.67]Nah, definitely.
[128:02.05]Sorry, you have to put... No.
[128:04.95]He just doesn't even care.
[128:05.87]He's not even listening.
[128:07.45]I'm doing it.
[128:08.67]Aren't you impressed?
[128:09.81]I mean, I could have done that, too.
[128:11.84]But I don't leave behind friends.
[128:13.96]Because he can't get over here.
[128:15.06]You started leaving him behind well before I did.
[128:18.28]Yeah, but that was before...
[128:20.17]It was cool.
[128:20.87]Now you got your own boat.
[128:21.76]Now you can go back and get them.
[128:22.88]I'm going to get you, Etalyx.
[128:23.80]I'm not going to be a fucking dicky.
[128:26.22]I'm coming to get you.
[128:27.72]Oh, don't you call me a dicky.
[128:30.22]Alright, just go the other direction, thinking face.
[128:36.84]Alright, here I come.
[128:38.84]I'm coming back to save you.
[128:39.68]Thinking face.
[128:45.05]I think we're at the shore, so there's no water.
[128:47.09]Here we go.
[128:48.65]You don't... You're not... You're pushing off the ground.
[128:51.47]Yeah, that's what I'm saying, because I think... We're at the shore now.
[128:54.36]No, that's... I need to go back and get him.
[128:57.44]Okay, there we go.
[129:14.33]Up and around.
[129:16.13]I'm coming.
[129:20.99]Okay, I gotta get one in the... Okay, grab this thing.
[129:25.20]You got us too close to the shore.
[129:28.96]God damn it.
[129:29.58]Thinking phase.
[129:30.80]I'm sorry this is my fault again.
[129:33.16]It is, because you didn't... Look.
[129:36.40]Now I can go.
[129:37.97]Now I can go.
[129:42.83]I'm coming.
[129:44.71]I'm almost there.
[129:48.85]Where are you, Talos?
[129:50.40]I'm behind a rock.
[129:51.70]Let me know when you're here.
[129:54.84]Oh, no!
[129:55.42]Oh, God.
[129:56.28]No, back!
[129:56.96]Did you... There's a whole, like, ocean out here that has me quite worried.
[130:02.98]Alright, I'm almost here.
[130:08.29]Mm!
[130:18.46]This is beyond awkward.
[130:20.42]What is all this fog?
[130:21.68]I can't.
[130:22.38]I'm doing this as fast as I can.
[130:25.90]Alright, I'm here.
[130:27.88]It's just the boat keeps turning.
[130:29.08]Oh my god, get the fuck out of my way.
[130:31.44]Alright, can you make it from here?
[130:37.67]Almost.
[130:38.83]Don't capsize yourself.
[130:43.23]Here I come.
[130:44.71]Oh my god.
[130:45.49]I'm almost there.
[130:46.72]yeah I'm waiting just head above water right now I'm going the other way so alright get in quick jump can you get in oh just barely can you get in oh my god do I have to like wedge this
[131:14.31]Oh, no.
[131:15.27]Oh, it's even worse than I thought.
[131:17.05]It's impossible.
[131:19.69]Oh, you landed here.
[131:20.69]We got to get the speed boat in.
[131:22.36]Playing the video game.
[131:23.46]Because we're here now.
[131:25.26]Alright.
[131:26.92]Oh, you guys, you tipped the boat.
[131:28.76]Yeah.
[131:29.24]Well, he did.
[131:31.34]Okay.
[131:33.10]Alright.
[131:34.10]Let's go.
[131:34.75]Okay.
[131:37.73]Everyone on this side.
[131:39.25]Jerma, off the boat.
[131:40.27]It's a fun thing to press.
[131:41.29]Okay.
[131:41.47]I'm ready.
[131:41.83]No.
[131:42.96]This is no- on this- on the same side as the naked mine.
[131:46.23]Why do we have to be on the same side?
[131:48.07]We're all gonna push from under here.
[131:49.47]Move down a bit.
[131:52.11]Okay, let's go.
[131:57.41]What's the goal here?
[131:58.01]To get in the water?
[131:59.11]Get in the water.
[132:01.01]We need- we need equal leverage.
[132:04.51]We've got the whole boat.
[132:07.61]Alright, it's in.
[132:11.06]Alright, everybody get in.
[132:14.22]Are we in?
[132:15.20]Alright, let's go.
[132:15.62]Oh god, I might need help.
[132:18.10]Oh, interesting.
[132:20.04]Never mind, don't help me, don't touch me, don't help me, don't touch me, don't help me, don't touch me.
[132:23.38]Don't help me and don't touch me!
[132:27.06]Oh, we might have to move the boat again.
[132:29.36]Well, we put it backwards.
[132:30.66]It doesn't look like you can steer it.
[132:34.39]Yeah, you can.
[132:35.55]You can turn it.
[132:36.21]See what I'm doing here?
[132:37.01]Well, you can't.
[132:38.75]Oh, no, it's good, it's good.
[132:39.73]We can fix this.
[132:44.47]Both of you in?
[132:45.23]Alright.
[132:48.07]I'm really... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[132:50.59]Watch it.
[132:50.83]You're in the way.
[132:51.27]Get out of the way.
[132:51.71]Get out of the way.
[132:52.53]Just get out of the way.
[132:53.21]You were standing in the way.
[132:56.46]I got it.
[132:57.50]I know it's opposite of where you're turning, but you were standing right next to me, so I couldn't turn the boat.
[133:02.84]We'll play with one arm behind my back now.
[133:04.48]Can you tell us a story?
[133:08.01]Sure.
[133:13.74]Alright, you're in.
[133:16.81]Alright, I got it.
[133:17.97]Where are we off to?
[133:24.68]Where are we going?
[133:26.02]The boat?
[133:27.36]The big boat?
[133:28.46]Out of the way, please.
[133:29.56]Don't fuck with the driver.
[133:30.64]Let's go to the big boat.
[133:39.33]Is it just throwing you in the water?
[133:44.49]Can you drive the big boat too?
[134:05.94]I don't think so.
[134:06.30]There's probably just like a star in here.
[134:07.42]There's probably like a Mario.
[134:08.36]You can drive the big boat.
[134:09.14]Are you serious?
[134:12.22]Where are you supposed to be taking us?
[134:13.16]I don't know.
[134:16.16]Wow, it's so huge!
[134:17.40]This is crazy!
[134:18.14]Okay, you get the other lever.
[134:20.54]So which way are we going?
[134:21.16]I don't know.
[134:23.28]Full steam ahead?
[134:24.84]Okay, yeah, yeah, because we have to turn, so that's how you turn.
[134:28.38]Tal, do you even in the boat?
[134:34.21]Alright, forward.
[134:35.47]Push forward.
[134:36.35]Forward.
[134:38.61]Aye aye, Captain.
[134:43.39]Aw, heckers.
[134:44.41]Oh, we gotta take the... No, forward!
[134:46.51]That's what I'm doing.
[134:49.15]Okay, forward.
[134:52.15]I'm gonna scream into your asshole.
[134:54.19]Okay, forward.
[134:54.77]Let's go.
[134:59.31]Forward.
[135:01.53]Oh, it's pushing me back.
[135:03.29]Get it forward, man.
[135:03.89]Come on.
[135:07.58]I mean, are you missing the funny laugh-out-loud L-U-L moment for us to drive the boat off the edge of the water?
[135:15.47]Where's the towt?
[135:16.43]Oh, oh, we gotta, we gotta turn, we gotta turn.
[135:18.39]Oh, I'm sorry, I couldn't, it's a complicated thing to explain.
[135:20.57]I'm on the side of the boat.
[135:23.25]What do you want to turn to?
[135:25.02]I am holding on.
[135:25.80]I think we need to fit on the left side of this.
[135:28.20]So like over here.
[135:29.42]So I'm going to go forward.
[135:30.28]You go backwards.
[135:31.66]You know, this is good.
[135:32.28]This is good.
[135:32.64]Alright.
[135:33.12]So then forward.
[135:33.68]Just grab on.
[135:34.36]No, no, no, no, no.
[135:35.38]You keep going forward.
[135:36.14]You keep going forward.
[135:36.86]Come on, Papa.
[135:38.98]I got it.
[135:39.28]I'm going forward.
[135:44.60]What are we shipping here?
[135:46.71]I can't.
[135:48.81]Cheetos.
[135:49.79]Cheetos?
[135:49.99]What?
[135:53.30]What's your favorite snack?
[135:54.10]What else is in this boat?
[135:57.67]We got the Dalai Lama.
[135:59.55]What?
[136:01.59]Don't worry, I'm just gonna swing here for eternity until we get to wherever we're going.
[136:07.29]You fit the boat in here.
[136:08.70]Let me fit the boat in here.
[136:09.98]We'll have to smash it into the wall.
[136:11.92]We're gonna bounce off the wall.
[136:13.18]Okay, we're not gonna bounce off the wall.
[136:15.16]Alright, we're fine.
[136:16.48]So just leave it as is and go out the window.
[136:18.68]No, no, no, no, no.
[136:19.82]We need to pull in there so that we can lift the crates with the thing up ahead.
[136:23.50]What?
[136:23.66]The crate lifter.
[136:25.14]I'm a barnacle on the side of the wall.
[136:26.60]Hold on.
[136:26.94]Fuck!
[136:27.20]Forward, forward, forward.
[136:30.71]I'm ten steps ahead.
[136:31.67]You're playing checkers, and I'm playing chess.
[136:34.00]Uh, actually, we're both playing checkers.
[136:36.30]You just took three pieces from me before we started.
[136:39.06]Keep it forward.
[136:39.62]Keep it forward.
[136:40.18]Keep it forward.
[136:40.78]Keep it forward, Pablo.
[136:41.66]Oh, no, they're gonna scrape me off the side.
[136:43.72]Uh, wait, Etalyx.
[136:44.58]Are you just not in here?
[136:45.58]Are you hanging off the side?
[136:47.62]Are you coming downstairs real quick?
[136:49.88]Wait, what's going on?
[136:50.64]What are you doing?
[136:56.01]Just, uh, you know, coming down the stairs real quick.
[136:58.05]What are you doing?
[137:00.22]You're alright.
[137:01.06]You're okay.
[137:01.88]You're fine.
[137:02.92]I'm getting squashed by like a thousand tons of pressure.
[137:08.20]Take the hand.
[137:10.80]I can't see anything.
[137:12.94]Grab ahold of whatever you can grab.
[137:17.98]Where's my boy?
[137:19.08]Come on.
[137:19.30]You got me?
[137:22.09]You have to tell me if I got you.
[137:23.41]I mean, it looks like you got me.
[137:26.31]No.
[137:27.43]No.
[137:31.80]Oh, my fucking God.
[137:34.14]Hold on, no, I'm good.
[137:37.52]Oh, I got you alright.
[137:38.80]Yeah, now you got me.
[137:40.02]Now I got his head.
[137:40.76]I got you alright.
[137:41.77]Grab my head.
[137:42.35]Oh, wow.
[137:44.77]No.
[137:45.57]Is the boat still moving?
[137:46.99]I'm going to fall.
[137:48.13]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[137:49.49]I got something.
[137:50.01]I got it.
[137:50.37]I got it.
[137:50.61]I got it.
[137:51.57]Can you go up now?
[137:53.47]I'm trying to pull you.
[137:54.93]It's so close.
[137:55.63]Don't look at my ass.
[137:57.57]Keep going.
[137:58.77]Almost there.
[137:59.21]Oh, alright.
[138:02.68]Come on, you pulled yourself off a tower.
[138:10.86]Hey, high five.
[138:11.34]That deserves a high five, don't you think?
[138:15.90]Onto the next.
[138:16.48]Okay, I didn't... Let go of my hair.
[138:18.68]I have goals.
[138:19.84]High fiving.
[138:21.22]This is a real job.
[138:22.22]People do this every day.
[138:24.56]So now what?
[138:28.20]Now I'm assuming we have to lift a box.
[138:30.91]Which box are we going to lift?
[138:32.57]blue or yellow my favorite color is blue I don't know about you guys but it's mine's blue but you remember the really fun GTA 5 mission where you did this for like 10 to 15 minutes yes and pretended that you cared does anyone remember how like fun and just great GTA 5 is it actually is a great like phenomenal fantastic technically advanced and socially artificial intelligence advanced video game were you getting at something I'm not sure he's getting at a lot of things
[139:00.69]I just smashed my face in the garage.
[139:05.04]What does this fucking do?
[139:08.86]Alright.
[139:09.28]Wait, wait, wait.
[139:09.90]We have to think about this.
[139:10.86]What does yours do?
[139:12.14]We have three levers.
[139:13.82]The one on the right is up and down.
[139:15.12]Okay.
[139:15.98]So this, I got to move this to the right a little.
[139:19.10]We can just grab this blue one.
[139:20.52]No, no, no, no.
[139:21.24]Wait a second.
[139:21.76]Wait a second.
[139:22.96]See where the hooks go?
[139:23.86]Which one do we want?
[139:24.82]Do we want the yellow one on top of the blue or the blue one on top of the yellow?
[139:27.70]Let's pick up because we have to hook it.
[139:29.20]So it's going to be down here.
[139:31.42]So now drop those.
[139:32.58]See the hooks?
[139:34.50]See where they go?
[139:35.74]Look at the corners.
[139:36.35]They have to go down there.
[139:37.65]So we need to go down.
[139:38.93]Back and forth.
[139:39.31]I think we have to go all the way to the left and pull the ones off of the cargo ship and put them on top of the ones to jump across.
[139:47.79]Is this some kind of currency thing?
[139:51.80]Why are you saying that?
[139:53.78]Wait.
[139:54.14]We could cheese it.
[139:55.26]Go all the way left.
[139:56.00]No.
[139:56.42]I don't want to cheese it.
[139:59.52]Cheese it.
[140:01.02]You just need to lower, then one guy can swing.
[140:05.76]Do you really want to do the GTA 5 mission right now?
[140:09.20]Why are you moving a stealth?
[140:10.84]Hey.
[140:13.36]What are you doing?
[140:13.84]Where are you taking us?
[140:15.08]I'm solving the puzzle.
[140:16.94]Solving the puzzle?
[140:18.00]It's really going to take less time.
[140:19.58]You're going to pick up the boat?
[140:24.16]No, you pick up the... You pick up the... Are you going to pick up the boat?
[140:28.34]Go get the boat?
[140:30.44]Alright, so get it where you want it.
[140:31.60]I think we have to pick up the little one.
[140:34.08]I thought that's all the way at the end.
[140:40.71]No, I didn't think that's what we were doing.
[140:42.59]I was asking if that's what he was trying to do.
[140:44.39]I think we're trying to pick up the boat right now.
[140:51.39]Okay, wait, wait, wait, Etalyx.
[140:52.43]Come on.
[140:58.01]Forward.
[141:01.14]Forward!
[141:02.30]Alright, get the hooks.
[141:04.16]Get the hooks?
[141:05.74]Down where they can pick up this box.
[141:07.54]Which box are you trying to get?
[141:08.58]Oh my god, is the game broken?
[141:10.28]I think it broke.
[141:13.05]I got nothing.
[141:15.81]I got nothing.
[141:16.51]Can you move?
[141:17.29]I think we lost Star.
[141:19.37]Yeah, I think he died.
[141:26.82]Because I'm frozen on my side.
[141:28.12]Yeah, look at him over there.
[141:29.88]I'm up.
[141:30.34]I'm up.
[141:30.74]I'm up.
[141:31.14]I'm up.
[141:31.56]Are you alright?
[141:32.10]Okay.
[141:32.26]Yeah, I'm good.
[141:33.61]I'm good.
[141:34.13]Don't look like it.
[141:34.79]I'm good.
[141:36.31]What's next?
[141:37.61]We're frozen.
[141:38.97]We're frozen in place.
[141:40.69]Why are you frozen?
[141:41.75]Your game, like, disconnected us.
[141:44.41]Yeah.
[141:44.73]You went, like, off the grid for a minute.
[141:46.55]I think we're off the grid here.
[141:48.37]No, I just pressed X and leaped down.
[141:51.71]Do you see us?
[141:52.27]What are we doing?
[141:54.03]We're going to have to, like, come back in.
[141:57.12]I have to exit.
[142:00.98]Alright.
[142:01.22]Play.
[142:02.50]Online.
[142:03.93]There you are.
[142:04.37]Connecting to server.
[142:07.75]Okay.
[142:08.39]So.
[142:09.03]That was weird.
[142:12.27]Okay.
[142:13.47]So we were moving on your screen.
[142:14.71]Interesting.
[142:15.17]Okay.
[142:16.78]What did you do?
[142:17.28]I didn't do anything.
[142:18.80]I just laid down.
[142:19.64]Did you like kick your router?
[142:22.16]No.
[142:22.74]I just laid down.
[142:23.92]You didn't just like boot your router as hard as you could for a second?
[142:27.46]Okay, so you want to pick up this pink one.
[142:33.50]Dallas.
[142:34.70]Yeah.
[142:35.62]You want to pick the pink one up.
[142:39.26]Mm-hmm.
[142:39.92]Alright, we're going to get it down.
[142:41.38]Raise the hooks a little bit.
[142:42.76]Alright, hold on.
[142:44.90]You've got to move back.
[142:48.20]It's the dangling.
[142:48.96]I think somebody needs to go and, like... I'll go take care of that.
[142:53.56]Oh, God.
[142:54.10]You have to do each one?
[142:55.85]And this is going to take less time than my idea?
[142:58.47]Hold on.
[142:58.83]I'll take care of this.
[142:59.51]This is going to be so simple.
[143:02.55]I want everybody in the chat right now.
[143:05.17]Count to three when I say so.
[143:06.73]And it'll be done in three seconds.
[143:09.33]So, hold on.
[143:15.91]When I say, I want you to count to three.
[143:20.82]Okay, now move it.
[143:24.68]We've got to get both of them.
[143:26.36]Get one.
[143:26.64]Hold on.
[143:29.12]God damn.
[143:29.50]Pull it up.
[143:30.50]Pull it up just a little bit.
[143:33.32]One tiny bit.
[143:33.80]The one on the front left is already attached, I think.
[143:35.98]This one's not attached, though.
[143:36.90]You've got to pull it up just a tiny bit.
[143:40.24]I get it.
[143:41.04]I understand.
[143:46.44]Almost.
[143:46.74]Hold on.
[143:48.64]There you go.
[143:49.14]That's one.
[143:50.54]Okay.
[143:51.00]That's one.
[143:51.48]Let me grab the other one.
[143:56.94]How did that move?
[144:04.34]Almost.
[144:05.15]Almost had it.
[144:05.53]Hold on.
[144:11.19]Do I need to lower it?
[144:13.45]No.
[144:14.43]I'm just in the way.
[144:21.21]How is that one not... I don't know.
[144:25.26]Alright.
[144:25.56]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[144:30.18]It's like bent.
[144:30.74]It's fun hearing you talk about doing this in the background.
[144:33.28]Why is it bent?
[144:36.26]Okay, I got it.
[144:37.08]Down.
[144:37.44]Here we go.
[144:40.50]Almost in.
[144:43.08]Almost.
[144:43.54]Get in there.
[144:44.03]Why are you doing this to me right now?
[144:45.59]Alright, it's in.
[144:48.09]Okay, another two.
[144:49.81]Just grab it, you piece of shit.
[144:54.63]What do you think I'm doing?
[144:55.49]Alright, you might need to... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[144:57.95]Hold on.
[144:58.31]Hold your horses here.
[145:02.59]This is like trying to make the bed.
[145:08.03]Move to the left.
[145:17.04]Stretch it out.
[145:19.36]There's no way those chains are going to reach all the way to the other side.
[145:22.48]I think you need the three people to do this.
[145:25.80]Alright, three seconds have gone by.
[145:26.98]I think it's time we give this a rest.
[145:28.56]It was definitely three seconds.
[145:29.70]Alright, so just grab onto the chain.
[145:31.72]Do the thing that he was going to do before.
[145:35.77]Okay, I got the chains.
[145:37.51]I will have played zero of this actual level.
[145:39.85]I haven't been in a boat.
[145:40.61]I don't know if you knew that.
[145:45.85]Well, the box is actually going.
[145:47.71]You mean moving the box?
[145:48.67]Alright, now move me over there.
[145:50.50]How the hell are you going to get over there?
[145:58.95]Oh, you're just flipping the blocks over.
[146:02.17]Actually, this... Hold on.
[146:04.73]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[146:06.57]No, you're beating me.
[146:08.43]I let go too early.
[146:09.69]It's okay.
[146:09.99]What are you doing over here?
[146:19.24]Get the fuck away!
[146:20.42]No!
[146:24.48]You're gonna hang out with your friends.
[146:26.22]Unless you're gonna swing me.
[146:28.21]I'm not gonna do it!
[146:28.99]Alright, I'm gonna swing you.
[146:31.07]Ready?
[146:36.51]There was an opportunity right there.
[146:37.53]You didn't even take it.
[146:39.04]This is not... This is much worse than it was without you.
[146:43.84]You're gonna play with your friends and you're gonna like it.
[146:46.08]No, I don't want to.
[146:47.10]Uh-oh.
[146:54.60]How are we doing over here?
[146:55.62]I think we actually need somebody.
[146:57.24]He has to help us do this.
[146:58.88]That didn't grab.
[146:59.94]That didn't grab.
[147:02.65]We're down a player.
[147:05.73]Come rescue me.
[147:09.31]Again, I don't understand how this game is cheating.
[147:13.48]Can you lift this thing up again?
[147:16.14]Like how far?
[147:17.66]As far as high as you can.
[147:20.37]What I'm trying to do is bridge the gap between the yellow and the blue.
[147:23.32]And then just jump across the other side.
[147:25.04]You kind of already did it.
[147:29.32]Oh, no.
[147:32.32]Has it gotten completely unhooked?
[147:34.47]Yes.
[147:35.53]Actually, it's got one... Actually, no.
[147:38.09]Keep it there.
[147:38.39]Keep it there.
[147:39.51]Let it go.
[147:39.79]Let it go.
[147:40.03]Let it go.
[147:40.99]That should be fine.
[147:41.45]I think...
[147:42.79]We both had the same idea.
[147:48.71]I think you can actually walk up that and you'll be fine.
[147:53.87]I'm fairly positive that that's going to be the case.
[147:55.85]I don't think it's close enough.
[147:57.13]You don't think so?
[147:58.31]No.
[148:00.86]Yes, it is.
[148:01.90]Above a certain point, it's not driving.
[148:04.96]You should be able to get to the top of that and jump.
[148:06.94]Go ahead.
[148:11.28]Oh, the top of the- I gotcha.
[148:12.86]I'm on board.
[148:13.34]Are you- are you- are you feeling this?
[148:14.78]I'm like the red thing.
[148:15.88]Oh, no.
[148:16.22]Oh, no.
[148:16.44]Too much weight.
[148:16.84]Too much weight.
[148:17.22]Too much weight.
[148:17.56]Back up.
[148:17.82]I'm gonna stand- I have good news.
[148:20.84]Oh, god damn it.
[148:21.64]What?
[148:23.02]Man, fuck it.
[148:24.30]What?
[148:24.60]What did I fall through?
[148:27.90]And he's gone.
[148:29.58]And he's gone.
[148:30.44]Oh, I went right down the cra- where?
[148:32.18]Right there.
[148:33.34]Alright, hi.
[148:35.02]Are you- are you ready to play the game now, or are you gonna try to cheat?
[148:37.54]Apparently, you can't grab the top of that ledge or something.
[148:42.42]So now what do we do?
[148:43.54]So we have to swing on the chains.
[148:50.41]Wait.
[148:50.69]Hold on.
[148:50.91]Easy.
[148:51.33]Easy.
[148:51.97]Hold on.
[148:52.51]I'm going to pull it.
[148:53.21]Hang on.
[148:53.49]I got to try something.
[148:54.21]Try something.
[148:55.47]No.
[148:56.53]No.
[148:57.47]No.
[148:58.40]No.
[148:59.50]Not my body.
[149:02.94]Give me one of the chains.
[149:04.28]Oh, shit.
[149:05.52]It was climb-up-able.
[149:06.84]We could have climbed it.
[149:08.06]Just reload the checkpoint.
[149:09.54]What have you done?
[149:12.23]Just reload the- What have you done?
[149:14.27]If it didn't get moved, you could climb up it.
[149:16.64]What have you done?
[149:20.28]He says reload the checkpoint?
[149:22.56]After I climbed the whole wall?
[149:24.60]Here.
[149:25.50]Hook it to these yellow ones.
[149:27.54]Get on top and see if we can pick up these cargo containers right here.
[149:31.80]Can somebody help me?
[149:35.50]I can't let go.
[149:37.86]I actually cannot let go.
[149:41.09]My fingers are pinched in the machine.
[149:42.61]I can't let go.
[149:46.26]Desperate times.
[149:50.20]Well, good luck.
[149:54.32]Why?
[149:54.54]What'd you do?
[149:55.00]I don't know.
[149:55.48]I got stuck underneath.
[149:56.30]Can you just press start and reload checkpoint?
[150:03.43]Yes, I can.
[150:08.92]Alright, here we go.
[150:10.12]I'm coming back up.
[150:12.89]Let's try this again.
[150:14.89]I'm sorry, I'm having so much fun doing the wrong things right now.
[150:17.93]Will you stop doing the World of Warcraft jump in the corner of Ironforge thing?
[150:24.17]You're doing the, I, look at me, I'm gonna jump with my mount in the corner in Ironforge in patch like 1.4.
[150:28.57]Welcome to patch 1.4, motherfucker!
[150:35.72]How are you even doing that?
[150:38.12]Alright, I need help.
[150:39.74]You need help.
[150:40.36]Well, I see what he's doing.
[150:41.74]Now I want to do that.
[150:43.70]I want to do that too.
[150:44.22]Where do you go from there?
[150:45.87]I don't know.
[150:46.31]Now I want to do the thing.
[150:49.17]You can't do the thing.
[150:50.07]What do you mean I can't do the thing?
[150:52.39]I mean, he's pretty true.
[150:54.21]You can't do the thing.
[150:55.27]I'm pretty true.
[150:57.33]I don't understand how you did that.
[150:58.97]Would you even explain?
[151:01.54]Were you just jumping?
[151:02.38]Pulling?
[151:03.18]You need to buy the Prima Strategy Guide.
[151:05.68]Jumping, pulling, rolling, dancing?
[151:08.87]I don't understand what you were doing.
[151:12.19]You grab the ground, you pull yourself up, you let go, then you immediately aim up again and grab again.
[151:17.25]So you did a little springboard action.
[151:19.31]Yeah, you kind of like launch yourself a little forward then grab.
[151:23.22]I don't care.
[151:25.32]Somebody else will do that.
[151:27.26]I did it.
[151:27.58]Yeah, so you did it.
[151:29.42]I don't even care.
[151:32.50]We actually might need to reload the checkpoint.
[151:35.21]Because this is impossible now.
[151:38.95]Would you say it is Finn possible?
[151:39.99]What achievement did we get?
[151:41.76]Why don't I just get an achievement?
[151:43.52]Because I turned the lighthouse on.
[151:45.04]Oh.
[151:46.60]There's a lot more to this level.
[151:48.12]I don't even know where we're supposed to go.
[151:54.00]This thing is in the complete, like, wrong place now.
[151:56.85]Are you trying to pick up one of the other ones?
[151:58.69]Yeah.
[152:00.07]And it's kind of working.
[152:01.19]Yay.
[152:01.51]Ooh.
[152:02.79]Ooh.
[152:04.36]It is kind of working, but how are you supposed to get on all sides?
[152:07.88]There has to be a thing where you can put slack on it or something.
[152:13.08]Unless we're meant to go back there now.
[152:18.53]Alright, so should I lift it up?
[152:20.69]Hold on.
[152:22.37]Should I lift this thing up a tad?
[152:23.69]Oh my god.
[152:25.59]Where did you just come from?
[152:27.19]Oh my god.
[152:31.98]Alright, so put it a little to the left.
[152:33.44]A little to the left.
[152:35.32]Yeah, and well, it's being picked up, so lower it first.
[152:39.41]They can be moved like this.
[152:43.07]Okay, that's to the right, but that's okay.
[152:48.11]Good thing we know our left from right.
[152:49.26]They couldn't go to the left.
[152:51.55]Yeah, but you... Okay, never mind.
[152:53.52]You're good.
[152:53.82]I was going to see if we could get all four hooks on somehow.
[152:57.78]Yeah, you're moving the red contraption.
[152:59.56]Yeah, I know, but you couldn't move... There was nowhere to go.
[153:03.94]Like, look, ready?
[153:05.62]I got an idea.
[153:06.27]I got an idea.
[153:06.99]Look, I just want to prove to everybody that I'm not insane.
[153:10.25]There's no moving to the left.
[153:11.45]It's just going to tilt it up.
[153:12.39]Stop moving it to the left, though.
[153:14.65]Now move it a little to the right until it's flush.
[153:16.67]Actually, no, look, the hooks are going in.
[153:18.74]Hold on.
[153:19.36]Oh, my God.
[153:20.54]Go do it, quick.
[153:22.57]Hold on, I only have one hand for some reason.
[153:24.35]I'm not, I can't.
[153:25.01]I'm scratching my balls with the other hand.
[153:26.73]I got two hands.
[153:27.71]I can't move.
[153:28.62]Look, my hand.
[153:29.16]Oh my god, please.
[153:30.18]You're bumping into this and ruining it.
[153:32.00]Just jump down.
[153:36.06]Where am I?
[153:37.54]And it made me move.
[153:38.70]That made me move.
[153:40.98]Why am I crashed against it?
[153:42.52]I don't know.
[153:43.04]I am magnetized to the bottom.
[153:45.27]Why are you down here?
[153:46.71]Look, look over the ledge.
[153:47.97]What's happening to our game?
[153:49.25]Why is like the mist coming in?
[153:53.49]We're being overtaken by fucking fog!
[153:56.17]Are you seeing the Stephen King in the mist?
[153:58.03]Uh, look, can you see over the edge?
[153:59.41]Are you allowed to move anymore?
[154:01.08]Where are you?
[154:01.70]Oh, you're- yeah, you're pri- what ha- I can't get out!
[154:06.72]I got magnetized here, I just gotta zap to it.
[154:08.82]Just load- just load the save.
[154:11.74]You gotta get back down- no, it's on.
[154:12.94]No!
[154:14.14]Try and pull me out.
[154:15.52]I can't pull you out!
[154:17.30]Try and pull me out.
[154:18.79]How am I supposed to do that?
[154:20.13]Get on, uh... My head is stuck in the metal.
[154:24.85]You want me to try to... Hold on.
[154:26.03]Try and grab onto me from the other side.
[154:27.93]Okay.
[154:30.59]Do I got you?
[154:31.63]No.
[154:31.99]No.
[154:33.51]I got you.
[154:35.17]No, I don't.
[154:36.13]Now I do.
[154:36.75]Alright, I got you.
[154:38.39]Try and grab it out with both hands.
[154:39.49]This ain't gonna do anything.
[154:42.28]I can't help you.
[154:45.65]It's because you made it a metal.
[154:46.89]You did this.
[154:48.13]Alright.
[154:51.30]Okay, we're good.
[154:52.98]So go attach that.
[154:54.50]Oh, my God.
[154:57.32]Hyper-realistic blood coming out of his eyes?
[154:59.28]What?
[155:00.85]What?
[155:01.23]Somebody said it's hyper-real... Oh, I don't know what they meant by that.
[155:06.01]Alright, get on over there.
[155:09.86]You're just on the top of the mountain.
[155:12.34]You are climbing the mountain.
[155:14.10]You ever played get over it?
[155:16.76]It's getting over it.
[155:17.68]I have.
[155:18.98]I got like 40% of the way through and I decided to never play it again.
[155:21.46]You ever get over it with Kenneth?
[155:24.45]Alright, are you attached?
[155:26.31]Hold on.
[155:30.45]That looks pretty close.
[155:31.53]Almost.
[155:31.81]Almost.
[155:38.66]No, too much slack.
[155:40.00]Way too much slack.
[155:41.26]Hold on.
[155:42.38]Up, not down.
[155:44.78]There you go.
[155:46.04]Go up.
[155:48.05]Going up in three seconds.
[155:49.43]One, two, three.
[155:50.55]Faster than that.
[155:53.15]That's not up.
[155:53.83]Going up in two seconds.
[155:55.67]One, two, three.
[156:01.20]More?
[156:02.30]Yeah, all the way.
[156:03.70]All the way?
[156:04.26]Why is it doing this?
[156:04.98]Yeah, all the way.
[156:05.94]All the way?
[156:08.72]You sure?
[156:10.34]We got it?
[156:10.82]Alright, now what do you want me to do?
[156:13.76]Over to the... Hold on, let me get you over here so you can make it.
[156:19.09]No, I'm not.
[156:22.73]Okay, so now I'm gonna go... That should be... Are you good to jump to the other side?
[156:27.01]I don't wanna make it too high.
[156:30.13]If it's too high, I won't be able to jump to it.
[156:33.96]I need to move it over here.
[156:35.44]It needs to be, like, on top of the blue one.
[156:38.08]On top... Hold on.
[156:39.86]Can I just do this?
[156:40.50]What's this going to make?
[156:42.14]It's going to put you right... Now I can move it to the right.
[156:46.03]You can go right next to the blue one.
[156:49.31]Can you get up here?
[156:50.07]Do I have enough slack here from the blue one?
[156:52.93]Let's see if I can make that.
[156:54.33]Here, pull it in front.
[156:56.43]Like, pull it back towards you.
[156:59.29]Towards you.
[157:01.60]Okay, now, stop, stop, stop.
[157:03.00]Too much.
[157:04.50]Back towards me.
[157:05.02]No, I think I can do that now.
[157:07.03]When that settles, I should be able to go from the blue, right?
[157:08.45]Now do it to the right, to your right.
[157:16.04]Okay, that looks good.
[157:17.28]I'm going for it.
[157:28.45]I'm so angry right now that I didn't make it.
[157:30.79]I'm so fucking mad.
[157:31.97]It really is just the funniest thing in this game, seeing arms outstretched, jump off the ledge, and then your character disappears.
[157:39.05]I gotta go rafting.
[157:40.08]You're just sitting in your own world over here.
[157:44.96]We would have been able to do this 33% faster if you were here.
[157:50.10]Maybe I would have been able to do it faster if you were here.
[157:53.58]Touché.
[157:57.03]Alright.
[157:58.37]So can I make this from here?
[157:59.99]I think I can.
[158:00.63]I wasn't supposed to do that yet.
[158:01.47]Oh dude, I skipped so much shit.
[158:06.31]This is kind of slippery.
[158:07.51]Very slippery, actually.
[158:08.41]Alright, I'm fine.
[158:09.11]Alright, quick.
[158:09.61]Follow me.
[158:09.91]No time to explain.
[158:14.20]No time to explain what?
[158:15.10]I don't get what I do here, though.
[158:20.12]I didn't make a mistake.
[158:20.84]I tried to jump and they fucking control it, Rogue.
[158:24.94]Just kill me, please.
[158:27.58]Just fucking kill me.
[158:29.46]Where did it respawn you?
[158:32.91]I tried to, like, make the check, because you told me don't time to explain, and I couldn't make it.
[158:37.67]Hey, how's it going?
[158:39.19]Because it was, like, already floating, and I couldn't stop it.
[158:42.10]Alright, how you doing?
[158:43.22]What does this do?
[158:45.96]Oh, now I'm the one on the other side.
[158:47.30]I see.
[158:48.38]That brings up the ski lift.
[158:51.00]The ski lift.
[158:51.86]That you were supposed to have been all the way down this mountain.
[158:54.92]See, Jerma?
[158:55.34]Wait, wait, wait.
[158:55.72]Look at this.
[158:56.72]Look at this.
[158:57.46]Hey, look.
[158:57.92]Look.
[158:58.18]Look.
[158:58.42]I can look.
[158:59.14]Look, there's a raft over there.
[159:00.62]Yeah.
[159:01.46]And we got to open this gate, and then you whitewater raft down the hill.
[159:04.78]So we're going to go on the snick couch cushion down the hill.
[159:09.90]But I can't figure out how to lift this gate.
[159:11.58]Let's pull it, right?
[159:15.09]That started on that.
[159:18.39]So I got rid of it.
[159:20.84]But it doesn't make any sense because these aren't connected to anything.
[159:23.98]It looks like somehow it's... This is still coming up, by the way.
[159:32.92]There's probably a button that you skipped.
[159:34.74]Like four hours of content.
[159:37.19]I don't think there's a button I skipped four hours of content ago.
[159:40.41]Attach it into the ski lift?
[159:42.15]There's a chain here.
[159:44.51]oh we might be able to attach yeah okay see that's because we skipped this content normally for this puzzle this would have been up here alright so here it is okay that's on and go go to the raft now I'll go to the raft you go to the raft and I'll pull it okay you get to do the fun part you happy I'm actually very happy I can't wait I'm not my hands are killing me alright so I'm on the I'm on the nickelodeon couch
[160:13.93]I'm pulling it out.
[160:17.01]Alright.
[160:18.55]I'm ready.
[160:22.68]There we go.
[160:24.06]Time to go.
[160:24.56]When you pass by, I'm getting on.
[160:31.26]Alright.
[160:32.97]I don't have very much control right now.
[160:36.69]The thing's gonna flip.
[160:37.91]You're gonna flip it.
[160:38.49]You're gonna flip it the second I get on it.
[160:40.07]It's okay.
[160:40.85]Just grab hold and tight.
[160:42.61]Distribute the weight.
[160:43.59]No, no, no.
[160:44.57]Before we go down, come over here.
[160:45.87]Get on the front.
[160:46.74]Distribute weight.
[160:47.98]We're gonna tip if you don't do this.
[160:49.56]You grab now.
[160:51.88]I'm fine.
[160:52.62]We're good.
[160:53.10]We're good.
[160:56.04]We need to distribute the weight.
[160:57.06]Are we gonna get stuck?
[160:57.68]No, we're not.
[160:59.56]Oh, fuck.
[161:01.41]Oh, no.
[161:01.99]Distribute the weight!
[161:03.89]You have to stand on that side.
[161:05.25]You have to distribute it!
[161:06.83]How?
[161:07.27]I'm one person.
[161:08.03]I can't move my body.
[161:08.83]I'm naked!
[161:09.03]Alright, we made it.
[161:11.35]Now what do we do?
[161:13.43]Is this the beginning of the level?
[161:17.47]Yes.
[161:20.07]Yes, it is.
[161:20.66]No.
[161:22.32]There wasn't this... There wasn't this... Where's Etalyx?
[161:26.50]The ferris wheel wasn't here.
[161:28.02]Oh, don't worry about me.
[161:29.66]Are you doing alright?
[161:31.82]This is the beginning.
[161:32.86]What the fuck?
[161:35.50]Oh, it wasn't spinning before.
[161:37.78]Yeah, we got it spinning because we opened the water.
[161:39.62]So get on the Nickelodeon couch.
[161:41.14]We're going to ride the Nickelodeon couch.
[161:43.71]No, we have to climb up this thing.
[161:44.87]I know, but we're going to do it with the Nickelodeon couch.
[161:46.77]What are you thinking?
[161:47.97]Oh, are we?
[161:48.61]Yeah, of course we are.
[161:49.89]Can you cross this catwalk?
[161:52.51]Does it even fit in there?
[161:53.63]Look at it.
[161:53.89]It's a perfect slot.
[161:55.53]No, it's not.
[161:56.98]You say that now, and then we'll just watch.
[161:58.36]There's no way.
[162:01.65]There's always a way.
[162:02.85]There's no way.
[162:04.81]Sorry, unrelated.
[162:07.01]There's no way.
[162:07.59]There's always a way.
[162:08.21]There's no way.
[162:10.03]Can we not get this in there?
[162:12.43]I'm telling you, this isn't going to happen.
[162:14.47]Turn it sideways, maybe?
[162:16.81]Maybe sideways.
[162:19.31]I'll hold it here.
[162:21.68]Yeah, hold on.
[162:22.06]What if I... I'm going to tilt it up.
[162:26.20]Is a talented monkey king in right now?
[162:28.02]He might be.
[162:29.82]Oh, got it.
[162:32.57]Oh no.
[162:33.37]This doesn't fit.
[162:38.01]It's gonna fit.
[162:38.61]I'm back.
[162:39.72]Alex, help us get this in here.
[162:41.22]Help us get the couch in here.
[162:42.86]We're stopping the whole thing.
[162:44.18]We have to slide it in there somehow.
[162:48.26]Like I never left.
[162:49.64]Are we trying to get it on the wheel?
[162:51.30]We're trying to get it in so we can ride it in the wheel.
[162:56.49]We're trying to get the four hot dogs.
[162:58.13]I give up.
[162:59.03]Am I holding you?
[163:00.19]I think I'm holding you.
[163:04.94]I think I stopped it.
[163:06.40]Wait, I have an idea.
[163:07.56]Okay.
[163:08.98]Now, I got one piece here.
[163:12.00]Can you push it up now?
[163:14.31]What if we just all grab?
[163:16.69]I think it stops no matter what.
[163:18.21]Yeah, it's stopping.
[163:19.23]It's not heavy enough to lift all of that.
[163:21.43]Yeah, this doesn't work.
[163:24.51]That's too much weight for the waterfall.
[163:28.29]Alright, let it go.
[163:30.19]Just ride it up.
[163:33.19]Well, it's nice of you guys to stop the raft so I can get back on it.
[163:39.13]The raft, it's not going at all.
[163:40.39]Why is this not moving?
[163:41.21]It's moving very slowly.
[163:44.27]Because there's too many people on it?
[163:46.28]It's just you two right now.
[163:48.06]Wait, what if I let go?
[163:49.10]Okay, I think we have to wait until you're over.
[163:53.78]If that's the case, then I'm going to try to bring the couch on the next run.
[163:58.86]Let me know when you're all the way over.
[164:00.14]Okay.
[164:02.81]Oh, I missed what you had to do.
[164:04.67]I see where you go now, though.
[164:06.60]Alright, I can bring the couch.
[164:09.64]How did you do that?
[164:10.94]I'm just holding on to both at the same time.
[164:12.74]There it goes.
[164:15.08]Can you get to the top?
[164:16.48]No.
[164:17.68]It's too heavy.
[164:19.78]You're still moving.
[164:21.02]On the right side, there's a lever.
[164:22.70]On the right side?
[164:23.12]There's like a diving board up there.
[164:25.52]Ugh.
[164:26.77]Ugh.
[164:30.59]Alright, hold on.
[164:31.49]Hold on.
[164:31.77]Wait, no, no, no, no.
[164:32.43]The couch.
[164:33.47]No!
[164:34.20]No!
[164:35.50]Oh.
[164:35.78]You fool.
[164:38.60]No, I fell.
[164:40.60]It's over.
[164:41.90]I was trying to wedge it in.
[164:44.34]It's wedged on the other side.
[164:47.38]Oh, boy.
[164:48.66]Oh, well.
[164:48.99]Alright.
[165:02.00]You fucked it up.
[165:04.86]I'm ready.
[165:07.26]Do we not need that anymore?
[165:08.30]No.
[165:09.29]We didn't need it at all.
[165:11.19]I'm fucking falling.
[165:13.95]What have I done?
[165:15.35]I blew it so bad here.
[165:20.72]What?
[165:24.41]There are plenty of couches.
[165:25.36]No, but that's not that one.
[165:26.76]I want that one.
[165:27.28]Where are we even supposed to go?
[165:28.18]I don't even know where you guys came from.
[165:29.52]At the top of this thing, there's a fucking lever, and it's hard to do.
[165:33.44]You have to grab the lever on the way over on.
[165:36.28]No, you have to jump off to the right on the platform, and then there's a lever.
[165:40.15]So grab the right side here.
[165:46.51]I'll let you guys go.
[165:48.39]Okay.
[165:49.28]I got this one.
[165:50.16]You're going to have two people on it.
[165:53.29]You can't have more than two, apparently.
[166:01.31]You must be this tall.
[166:04.09]Come on.
[166:04.61]My holding left trigger sucks.
[166:09.47]Why have we stopped at the top?
[166:10.57]I don't like stopping at the top of the Ferris wheel.
[166:12.38]It gives me so much anxiety.
[166:13.18]You need to spin the Ferris wheel.
[166:14.94]Give us a spin.
[166:16.14]Whoa.
[166:16.26]Alright, so we're jumping to the right.
[166:18.38]So you're not even going to jump.
[166:24.48]Now we got a lever.
[166:25.65]We turn on the... Is this the ski lift?
[166:30.95]What is this for?
[166:32.61]I don't know.
[166:35.41]Oh, it's a diving board.
[166:36.91]Oh, God.
[166:37.79]Oh, you can do this one.
[166:39.31]You can... Yep.
[166:43.65]So where are we diving to?
[166:45.35]Into that hole that I just opened.
[166:46.92]Oh, fuck!
[166:47.64]That might be the end of the level.
[166:49.04]Okay, I'm in.
[166:51.69]Yep.
[166:52.45]Dude, I must have skipped some.
[166:55.65]The torment never ends.
[166:56.73]I didn't see a single piece of that level.
[166:59.10]Except for the hook.
[167:00.72]That's the only thing I did the whole level.
[167:04.46]Now, you guys are screwed now.
[167:06.62]You're in a rat maze.
[167:08.24]Oh no, we're in the portal.
[167:10.90]Chords to rip out.
[167:14.91]Here, put your tongue on this.
[167:18.81]That's my finish.
[167:21.09]I already stopped the fan.
[167:23.65]I want the thing.
[167:24.35]We have to take the cords through and around to this side.
[167:27.09]We're going to take the cords out and through.
[167:30.82]Okay, so stop the thing with this, and then cords go through.
[167:35.70]Cords go through.
[167:37.00]Cords go through.
[167:37.82]I was trying to hurt somebody there.
[167:42.12]Cords go through.
[167:42.56]I was trying to have a workplace accident.
[167:45.46]Hold on.
[167:45.76]Alright, cord coming through.
[167:51.94]Cords go through!
[167:53.56]Unplugged cords!
[167:54.64]They do need to plug in somehow to the wall over here.
[167:57.76]Right here.
[167:58.08]Blue to blue, red to red.
[168:02.19]I like your dramatic music.
[168:06.13]You could get electrocuted at any time.
[168:11.39]Alright, that's in, that's in.
[168:13.23]I can't even see the red one anymore.
[168:15.19]It's just two balls.
[168:17.93]Nice!
[168:26.09]Alright, so now we got two of these.
[168:27.93]We have reached the portal phase of the game.
[168:29.65]Yeah, we've reached the actual puzzle part of the game.
[168:33.45]Do we have to connect those two now to these?
[168:35.07]I don't understand.
[168:41.74]What do we do with this tube?
[168:48.30]Where are you guys going?
[168:49.10]We need these.
[168:49.48]Don't just leave them.
[168:53.50]Where does he go?
[168:54.08]Is he skipping the level again?
[168:55.68]Is he running away again?
[168:58.18]I don't know where he went.
[168:59.18]Here, I'm going to drop the noodle over there.
[169:00.41]You have to grab it.
[169:07.51]Be the cheese you want to see in the world.
[169:11.19]Here.
[169:13.60]Okay, I got... I'm not skipping.
[169:14.96]I'm not skipping.
[169:15.62]I'm going to hand this to you.
[169:16.32]This is the alternative route.
[169:18.00]So I'm going to swing this back and you have to pick it.
[169:19.48]You have to grab it with your hand.
[169:23.90]Hold on, I gotta get up first.
[169:26.10]It's the alternative.
[169:29.22]My head, it's getting in the way.
[169:34.75]I can't, is this even gonna work?
[169:37.03]Eat the red licorice, no.
[169:39.69]Oh, I'm falling.
[169:40.95]Okay, well now, now you have to, now you have to grab this.
[169:53.17]I don't want it.
[169:53.91]I don't want this.
[169:57.09]Star, help.
[169:58.41]I'm running out of strength in my hands to hold down the triggers.
[170:02.07]I'm coming.
[170:02.59]I'm coming.
[170:02.95]Where are you?
[170:03.49]Grab the end of this.
[170:05.25]End of what?
[170:06.27]The end of the tube.
[170:06.87]Just grab it.
[170:07.57]Oh, my.
[170:08.95]What?
[170:09.73]Paul, grab the end of the tube.
[170:11.55]I have faith you can do it.
[170:17.85]I thought I was being the big skipper.
[170:21.55]And you guys are skipping.
[170:22.87]What are you talking about?
[170:23.73]We're just trying to get this piece over there.
[170:25.73]You can't skip until you actually skip, you know?
[170:27.65]Right now it's just an attempt.
[170:29.47]Come on, grab the thing!
[170:33.01]Should I wiggle it around for you?
[170:34.11]Okay, I'm gonna wiggle it around.
[170:37.27]Maybe that'll help.
[170:42.15]That doesn't help.
[170:45.87]Alright, good.
[170:47.81]So now...
[170:51.80]Are we, like, doing a Tarzan?
[170:53.54]I think you try to swing.
[170:54.68]Okay, we need to swing the same way.
[171:00.97]Okay, you ready?
[171:02.97]Going left.
[171:03.73]Outward.
[171:04.69]Right.
[171:05.87]Okay.
[171:07.11]In.
[171:07.27]Out.
[171:08.17]This is never going to work.
[171:10.05]In.
[171:10.31]Don't say that.
[171:11.67]Out.
[171:12.61]Hold on, I got an idea.
[171:14.29]In.
[171:14.45]I have an idea.
[171:18.43]Everyone close your eyes.
[171:21.74]In.
[171:23.15]Out.
[171:26.09]In.
[171:27.53]Out.
[171:28.87]As Hox is trying to ruin it, he's trying to get in between.
[171:31.29]In.
[171:32.59]Out.
[171:33.85]I'm trying to add... No!
[171:36.10]I was over there first.
[171:38.90]See you later, motherfucker.
[171:41.92]Oops.
[171:42.24]Okay, I'm doing the other skip then.
[171:43.96]If you're not going to do that skip, I'm doing the other skip.
[171:45.74]No, let's beat it.
[171:46.40]Let's do the real thing.
[171:49.03]Is there even a real thing?
[171:50.83]You have to connect this somehow to something else.
[171:53.01]We have to double it up.
[171:54.07]I don't know.
[171:55.76]Come over here.
[171:57.48]What do you mean over here?
[171:59.28]Back to where we started.
[172:00.90]This is the obvious thing to do.
[172:05.38]Where are you going?
[172:07.76]Oh, I think I can make it.
[172:09.14]Are you trying to go across from here to there?
[172:10.90]Weren't we just over there?
[172:13.32]No.
[172:14.34]We were never over here.
[172:15.28]So you're trying to slide this over here.
[172:18.38]Yeah.
[172:22.96]Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[172:24.60]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[172:26.12]You want me to hold it down for you?
[172:28.48]Yeah, and then I'll... Oh, no-ee.
[172:32.04]Okay, I'll hold it from here.
[172:37.05]Okay, okay.
[172:38.91]Towards the wall.
[172:40.15]Hold it down as much as you can.
[172:41.45]Now we're in business.
[172:43.91]I can do this puzzle by myself.
[172:50.54]Which one do you think goes first?
[172:54.48]You need a bigger angle.
[172:56.84]I need to like... Half of it needs to be on the ground.
[172:59.90]Okay.
[173:02.43]Like this.
[173:04.39]Yeah.
[173:04.85]Keep half of it on the ground.
[173:07.75]I'm going to grab it from here.
[173:20.44]Where are we?
[173:22.03]Where are we?
[173:23.85]How did you do this?
[173:24.97]Oh, welcome to the party.
[173:26.83]Hey, we... Star, just fall off.
[173:30.05]No.
[173:30.97]Yes.
[173:31.98]I'm convinced this is further ahead.
[173:35.92]No, it is.
[173:36.30]It is very far ahead.
[173:38.02]Hey, how's it going?
[173:42.13]We're just having fun here, connecting the dots.
[173:48.34]Okay, now we can... Red to red.
[173:51.22]Now, what do we do?
[173:51.90]We need some... Hello?
[173:54.22]Hello?
[173:55.34]Is somebody here?
[173:56.22]Is somebody at the door?
[174:00.35]I think this thing... It went from red to green, so I think it charged.
[174:06.61]I think we have to do this out.
[174:10.56]Dual revolver!
[174:11.44]We need these two pieces.
[174:12.46]Are you doing air guns because you won?
[174:15.88]We need these two pieces.
[174:19.06]Isn't that door supposed to be open?
[174:20.78]I think so.
[174:21.24]There's two doors here.
[174:23.98]Where are you guys?
[174:26.24]I'm a little stuck here.
[174:27.20]We're doing the actual game.
[174:29.22]I'm doing the actual game.
[174:31.24]I don't even know how you got over here.
[174:32.70]Oh no, you unplugged it.
[174:37.44]I'm driving a dump truck.
[174:38.97]I hope you're having a fun time right now because we're doing the actual puzzle game.
[174:43.97]I hope you're having a fun right now because I'm doing the fun right now.
[174:46.77]It's in my crotch.
[174:50.51]Okay.
[174:50.97]That was the idea.
[174:51.91]And... Eureka!
[174:57.99]Hold on.
[174:59.39]Well, you... I thought it was going to be one button.
[175:02.62]A little higher.
[175:06.64]Okay.
[175:07.52]Generator.
[175:08.04]I think you know what to do here.
[175:16.88]Push it off the edge.
[175:19.52]I don't think you can push this anyway, so... I want this piece, too.
[175:24.76]Red to red.
[175:26.98]That's blue.
[175:27.50]That's blue.
[175:28.50]Pull it out, please.
[175:30.33]This is a hard puzzle.
[175:38.03]I will say, though, my hands are, like, cramping up.
[175:42.07]I'm cramped and sweaty.
[175:43.91]It's like holding the triggers down.
[175:46.96]Yeah, you have to... The whole game.
[175:48.54]You cannot let go of the triggers.
[175:49.78]Okay, so you're going to charge this up?
[175:55.87]You go.
[175:56.51]You go.
[175:59.15]Almost.
[176:01.89]There it is.
[176:02.47]Alright, I think we... You need some help?
[176:06.03]Alright, I think it's running.
[176:09.58]Alright, yeah, we got it.
[176:11.28]We're good.
[176:11.54]We might have to bring this over here.
[176:16.27]I don't think we can pick it up.
[176:17.91]I think we can move it, can't we?
[176:19.95]I don't think we... Well, we may need to.
[176:23.51]There's no cords over here.
[176:25.59]Here, help me with the forklift.
[176:27.39]Let me just get the cords.
[176:30.27]Let me just get the cords.
[176:35.13]Oh, baby.
[176:36.57]Come on, give me these.
[176:37.49]Give it to me.
[176:41.79]I did it.
[176:42.25]I had it, too.
[176:44.33]God damn it, I had it.
[176:45.31]Alright, I got him.
[176:52.94]On my way.
[176:53.36]Where are you going with that?
[176:59.18]Hold on, wait.
[176:59.82]I can't stop.
[177:00.66]We need to open this.
[177:06.49]I turn the wheel.
[177:07.31]There's kind of a lot of things.
[177:08.84]Alright.
[177:09.14]So how do we... We need to plug this into the generator then.
[177:12.08]So you need to pick this up.
[177:12.72]You need to pick that up.
[177:13.66]No, no, no.
[177:14.32]You're going the right way.
[177:15.01]You're going to pick this up.
[177:16.67]Yeah, you're going to pick the generator up.
[177:19.73]Oh.
[177:22.19]I'll guide you.
[177:23.03]Come over here.
[177:24.05]I can't.
[177:24.47]A little bit more forward.
[177:26.49]You good?
[177:27.56]You good?
[177:27.88]You good?
[177:29.24]A little bit further?
[177:30.76]I think we're playing two completely different games on the same stream together.
[177:35.82]You got some more room.
[177:36.58]Keep going.
[177:36.80]You good?
[177:37.82]You good?
[177:39.43]Keep going, you're good.
[177:40.00]A little bit further.
[177:41.68]There's something in the way, but you're good.
[177:43.52]Five more feet.
[177:44.82]I'm playing Coal Miner, Sim.
[177:47.12]Coal Miner?
[177:48.56]There's just sad music because I'm depressed to them with Coal Miner, and I'm the only Coal Miner.
[177:53.77]You're good?
[177:54.07]Beautiful, looks good.
[177:55.25]Alright, a little bit further.
[177:56.19]You're good?
[177:57.71]I'm going to plug these into the wall.
[178:00.53]Are you sure this thing can be picked up?
[178:02.92]Yeah, it can.
[178:03.30]Yeah, why would the forklift even be here?
[178:06.26]to raise the other door?
[178:08.14]It almost looks like I can just lift up the door.
[178:11.85]No, you... Get it.
[178:19.13]In.
[178:20.31]Get it in.
[178:21.89]Get it in the red slot.
[178:26.00]What?
[178:26.20]Are you talking to me?
[178:27.26]No, me.
[178:29.84]Oh, you're talking to you.
[178:30.68]Okay.
[178:33.98]No.
[178:34.50]Grab the... There.
[178:35.90]Get the blue one.
[178:37.70]On my way.
[178:38.58]Okay.
[178:39.84]Hold on.
[178:40.14]Stay right there.
[178:46.32]Hold on.
[178:46.70]Don't move it.
[178:48.13]You can just keep it there.
[178:48.77]I don't think we're going to need it again.
[178:51.21]I feel like we could have just... Now, you do it.
[178:54.49]Rev it up.
[178:54.87]Do you realize there's a little block here where you could probably just put the forklift under and raise the door?
[179:01.05]That's not the fun way.
[179:03.25]I mean, it's definitely an intended way.
[179:06.15]Help me.
[179:10.43]Alright.
[179:12.05]Electricity.
[179:14.68]Pull the lever.
[179:17.08]Up.
[179:20.04]What?
[179:21.36]What happened?
[179:21.66]What did you do?
[179:23.62]What happened?
[179:24.83]Did I do anything?
[179:26.81]Maybe we have to, like, hold this while you do it?
[179:29.23]Did we run out of power?
[179:40.58]I think we've rented a juice.
[179:43.76]Okay, no.
[179:44.22]Okay.
[179:44.58]Go, go, go, go, go.
[179:46.50]I'll hold this.
[179:46.90]Alright.
[179:49.24]Come on.
[179:50.68]Quickly.
[179:51.89]High enough for the cart to get through?
[179:53.55]No.
[179:53.97]No.
[179:54.81]One of you guys should just jump off the map.
[180:00.35]You know, just every once in a while.
[180:02.89]Just you go through.
[180:04.61]It's only for like a certain amount of time.
[180:09.13]It doesn't matter.
[180:09.53]I don't want to read the forklift anymore.
[180:13.68]Alright, go.
[180:19.38]Go!
[180:21.88]Alright.
[180:23.63]No!
[180:24.37]Hang on.
[180:28.09]Hold on.
[180:28.65]Hold on.
[180:30.03]Grab my hand.
[180:30.43]Stay there.
[180:30.93]Don't move.
[180:31.61]The paramedics are on the way.
[180:32.49]Oh, fuck me.
[180:34.88]Are you dead?
[180:35.52]No, I'm fine.
[180:36.36]I'm just gonna...
[180:43.06]Is there a way for me to open that door for you?
[180:44.86]No, I can get it.
[180:45.54]I'm just going to pull this stupid thing again.
[180:47.36]Oh, so now I have to drive down there.
[180:52.14]Go, go, go, go.
[181:00.76]No, don't come back.
[181:03.16]Hurry.
[181:04.00]Hurry.
[181:05.82]Alright, we're fine.
[181:07.44]Yeah.
[181:09.90]Uh-huh.
[181:10.20]This is a big room.
[181:12.01]There's a pizza delivery boy statue.
[181:12.99]Star, where are you?
[181:15.27]Star could be anywhere at this point.
[181:16.27]He could just be anywhere.
[181:17.81]I'm really, I'm doing the main quest.
[181:19.33]You guys are doing the side quest right now.
[181:24.55]Okay.
[181:24.91]Go across the pinball flipper.
[181:26.09]I'm gonna go across.
[181:32.82]That opens this door.
[181:33.80]Okay, so that opens, alright.
[181:35.72]Here's the unfortunate thing.
[181:37.77]I think we do need him over here.
[181:39.87]I don't think we can progress.
[181:40.67]Uh, I don't know.
[181:41.93]This game was made for solo.
[181:43.22]Made for solo?
[181:46.28]Yeah, you can play this all by yourself.
[181:47.64]How?
[181:48.12]Believe it or not.
[181:50.68]He doesn't believe it.
[181:51.32]How would you pull one of those levers?
[181:52.34]Hold on, that's a red switch next to you.
[181:56.27]Well, I'm solo and I've gotten further than you guys, so boom.
[182:02.51]Okay, that moves.
[182:04.19]That.
[182:04.43]Uh-huh.
[182:06.27]Okay.
[182:08.61]Me stepping on this opens this door.
[182:12.30]You have to come over here.
[182:14.66]Uh, how am I gonna do that?
[182:16.34]I don't know.
[182:16.70]Don't you understand?
[182:17.96]That's not possible.
[182:24.32]Maybe you're not supposed to be over there yet.
[182:26.32]So I'm gonna bring you back.
[182:28.31]Bring you back.
[182:31.13]Grab this.
[182:31.97]I mean, I guess I could try to grab that.
[182:37.78]Okay, I'm on the conveyor belt.
[182:40.04]There's nothing over here.
[182:43.60]There's a box.
[182:45.50]What should I do?
[182:46.44]Should I press this button?
[182:47.98]Try to go get the box.
[182:50.04]This box?
[182:51.38]The wooden box to your right.
[182:53.86]Oh, okay.
[182:54.26]The left.
[182:54.88]Hold on.
[182:55.47]Don't fall.
[182:57.39]You're not going to make it.
[182:59.71]Oh, you made it.
[183:00.23]Alright, now I get the box.
[183:02.55]Now put the box on the conveyor belt.
[183:09.48]Now put the box on the button.
[183:12.78]Yeah.
[183:13.76]There you go.
[183:14.26]Now you can go through that door.
[183:15.62]Where does that door go?
[183:16.72]Now you're thinking... Let's find out.
[183:21.88]Okay, that just scared the shit out of me.
[183:23.02]Alright, so I can get the plugs back here.
[183:26.53]So do I need to bring these cords back?
[183:30.33]We have two cords here already.
[183:32.45]Do we need a third one?
[183:33.37]What's the point of this?
[183:37.21]Oh, I just closed that door on me, though.
[183:43.84]Are you locked out now?
[183:44.96]No.
[183:46.88]Just desperately trying to pull this.
[183:48.42]I got a cord.
[183:49.64]What's the point of this?
[183:52.24]The battery?
[183:52.80]Okay, yeah, the battery can come through.
[183:54.36]Okay.
[184:01.69]And?
[184:01.99]I'm coming with the battery.
[184:02.83]I think the battery goes for this.
[184:04.31]Yeah, we need the battery.
[184:06.73]But it needs to be charged.
[184:08.59]Isn't it already?
[184:09.92]I'm just like, I have this innate fear of dying.
[184:13.88]In this game, we're gonna be solving a puzzle and then the screen's gonna load the next one.
[184:19.10]This is gonna fall me over the edge.
[184:20.16]Pull the thing.
[184:22.02]My arms are both behind my back.
[184:24.42]I'm holding this backwards.
[184:26.22]I'm arrested right now with handcuffs.
[184:28.18]This is the handcuff.
[184:29.04]Alright, good.
[184:37.41]Let's go.
[184:42.69]You understanding how stupidly I'm doing this?
[184:46.41]Oh my god, really?
[184:47.69]Okay, just let go.
[184:48.61]My guy's so tired.
[184:53.94]You know how tempting it is just to drop it?
[184:55.64]Oh, it is very tempting, but don't do it.
[185:02.31]Okay.
[185:03.31]Connect the wires.
[185:12.16]There you go.
[185:13.58]Blue to blue, red to red.
[185:17.66]Red to red.
[185:18.20]Okay.
[185:21.91]Uh-huh.
[185:22.65]Now what does that do?
[185:24.65]Opens this up.
[185:25.85]Oh, boy.
[185:27.45]Look where we are.
[185:28.27]I wonder if we can find Star.
[185:30.61]He's doing his own game.
[185:32.35]He didn't even see the coal mining.
[185:34.65]He probably already did this.
[185:36.95]What are you guys doing right now?
[185:38.13]I didn't see coal mining.
[185:39.17]We're burning coal.
[185:40.15]We're having so much fun.
[185:41.53]Close it up.
[185:42.49]You're burning coal?
[185:43.65]Yes.
[185:44.97]That concerns me.
[185:47.81]Green energy has not been invented.
[185:51.05]Consider the environment.
[185:53.53]And he's gone.
[185:55.29]I'm destroying all of them.
[185:56.45]I'm allowed to be in here, I guess.
[185:57.23]That's what I'm doing.
[185:58.77]I'm okay.
[185:59.19]Just pass me the other one.
[186:00.81]Oh god.
[186:03.39]That one's in there.
[186:09.32]So that one's going.
[186:11.28]One in here, sir.
[186:15.43]You guys having fun together?
[186:16.61]Yeah, it's fun.
[186:17.51]How do you turn this on?
[186:19.79]I don't know.
[186:21.43]Make sure it's in.
[186:23.43]I feel like I wish I had friends to play with.
[186:25.21]Yeah, well maybe if you didn't skip everything.
[186:33.14]Don't take that tone with me.
[186:35.21]Oh, fuck.
[186:35.67]You skipped too, didn't you?
[186:37.03]No.
[186:37.17]Didn't Italic skip?
[186:38.45]No.
[186:38.61]We skipped like one room.
[186:39.95]Alright, close it up.
[186:41.11]Now we gotta find a way to turn these on.
[186:47.71]Close it!
[186:48.39]Okay, closed.
[186:49.93]The other two need to be closed.
[186:52.70]Oh, I found them.
[186:54.08]Oh, hey.

[187:07.18]Okay, I don't know where this is going.
[187:10.20]We're gonna finish our work.
[187:14.08]This thing probably has to be closed.
[187:15.12]Okay, that's closed.
[187:18.00]Good.
[187:19.20]Now we got this one closed, that one closed.

[188:03.78]I'll do this.
[188:06.02]Where are we going?
[188:06.64]I don't know.
[188:07.18]Do we have to put all the coal in the machine?
[188:09.44]I think you might have to come this way where I am.
[188:12.00]Where is he?
[188:12.84]I'm not sure.
[188:13.62]Behind you.
[188:16.74]Turn.
[188:18.26]Cut the wheel.
[188:22.92]Cut the wheel.
[188:23.38]Cut the wheel.
[188:24.94]You're doing it the wrong way.
[188:25.68]You're cutting the wheel the wrong way.
[188:27.90]I'm cutting the wheel so that we can turn around.
[188:30.32]Hold on.
[188:31.44]A little more.
[188:32.38]Back up.
[188:36.40]Back it up.
[188:38.98]Keep going.
[188:40.33]I can see how much more we got.
[188:41.49]Don't worry.
[188:42.13]Keep going.
[188:42.73]You got a few more inches.
[188:43.81]Okay.
[188:44.23]Stop.
[188:44.47]Stop.
[188:44.69]Stop.
[188:45.09]Turn all the way the other way.
[188:47.15]Cut it.
[188:50.39]Wow.
[188:50.65]Put me all the way up here.
[188:52.11]We're doing a three point turn here.
[188:53.31]Okay.
[188:53.57]Cut it again.
[188:57.54]Alright, cut it.
[188:59.34]It was the speed run to the torch.
[189:01.54]Okay, cut it.
[189:04.30]Cut it.
[189:05.92]You're still going backwards.
[189:07.16]Fuck, cut it.
[189:08.14]Cut the wheel.
[189:10.43]Drive us.
[189:11.91]That's my fault.
[189:13.73]He gave us specific instructions to not fuck this up.
[189:17.89]Where are we even going right now?
[189:20.47]We have to put the coal in the furnace.
[189:22.67]Alright, drive us.
[189:24.75]Wow, you're doing it.
[189:33.85]Where do we go?
[189:34.47]It's pretty much kind of cutting off right now.
[189:36.39]Wait, what do you mean?
[189:37.17]Why did you tell us to come this way?
[189:38.03]Just stop, just stop, just stop.
[189:41.12]You might have to put it inside there.
[189:42.58]There's like a giant fan.
[189:43.68]I don't know what that would do, though.
[189:44.62]Inside the fan?
[189:47.58]No, you're going to put it in the coal burners.
[189:49.38]Wait, where are the coal burners?
[189:51.26]Let's just drop.
[189:52.42]Oh, whoa!
[189:53.82]And he's gone.
[189:54.55]Bye.
[189:56.81]I want to do that.
[189:58.87]Did you guys go up here into where it's pointing?
[190:01.01]The door up here?
[190:01.77]That fan...
[190:05.53]Yeah, the fan.
[190:10.79]Hi.
[190:11.95]Oh, the stick of fire.
[190:13.57]Or is it the coal all the way at the beginning?
[190:16.17]The coal burners are right at the beginning of that area.
[190:20.83]I skipped so much.
[190:21.88]I don't know.
[190:22.52]Where'd you get that flame?
[190:23.56]Where'd you get the giant stick?
[190:24.28]I found a stick of fire on the side of the road.
[190:25.94]Somebody threw out their cigarette from the passenger window.
[190:28.40]So go light up the other ones.
[190:30.00]So maybe you have to go start the other ones.
[190:32.72]We have to drive the car back over here.
[190:36.31]Oh, what if I just put it in the back of the truck?
[190:39.24]See if all of them catch fire.
[190:40.86]I tried to light them on fire, and I tried to put it in the back.
[190:45.68]Local streamer invents fire.
[190:47.48]Alright, I need some help with this.
[190:49.06]I want somebody to help me drive.
[190:51.16]Who wants to help me drive?
[190:52.12]I just need somebody to open these things.
[190:56.03]Doing the thing.
[190:57.63]Open the door.
[191:01.81]Not the first one, though.
[191:12.15]Those things are making more sense.
[191:16.51]Alright, I need help over here.
[191:18.27]Yeah, I didn't I didn't have the whole puzzle.
[191:21.45]See, we have three people need to butt some heads.
[191:25.65]First one's already lit.
[191:28.27]And we probably have to get to the max with more coal.
[191:35.14]So it turns out we were playing two different games, but they met in the middle.
[191:40.50]See, it's just that we're so brilliant.
[191:41.76]What's with this thing?
[191:45.96]It's really hot in here.
[191:49.21]Alright.
[191:51.09]We'll throw the torch down here the whole time.
[191:56.21]Alright, now we just need the rest of the coal.
[191:58.81]I'm going to go get the truck, and I'm going to drive it the frick off.
[192:06.78]I got it.
[192:10.18]There needs to be a sprint key.
[192:14.69]I'm so slow.
[192:15.39]My hands hurt so much.
[192:19.97]Oh, drama.
[192:29.00]You're doing the Austin powers right now.
[192:53.63]It's floating.
[192:55.73]I can't do anything about it.
[193:00.25]It's just up here.
[193:01.50]It's just levitating
[193:20.65]Well... Can I step on the gas?
[193:27.59]I think I might be able to save the car.
[193:28.85]I'm just going to put some weight over here.
[193:33.78]Yep, I was going to pull it.
[193:39.58]Almost.
[193:46.80]I can't tip it.
[193:48.17]We need some more weight over here.
[193:49.69]I need at least a body.
[193:50.99]There's another dump truck at the top of the hill if we really need one.
[193:53.87]I'm on fire.
[193:54.37]I'm dead.
[193:54.65]I'm dead.
[193:54.91]I'm dying.
[193:55.28]I'm dying.
[193:55.70]Burn damage.
[193:56.60]Alright.
[193:57.26]I'm going to land it.
[193:58.84]I'm going to surf the car.
[193:59.86]I'm pushing it under the car.
[194:01.24]Alright.
[194:01.46]Here I am.
[194:02.95]just just grab two pieces of coal and jump in the fan and we only need like a few more okay okay no no but what happened was um I was under the dump truck and the force of me being pushed by the fan pushed the dump truck back onto the um well I mean it's upside down but that besides that why would it drive alright help me push it hold on I got an idea
[194:29.77]We're two people.
[194:30.83]You can't lift a dump truck.
[194:32.67]What are we, Superman?
[194:33.57]What?
[194:33.75]How?
[194:37.95]Dump it.
[194:39.37]Oh, that's a good idea.
[194:41.87]It's not moving.
[194:47.92]You're truly like, this is a horrific accident.
[194:50.54]You're pinned and you called and someone's there holding your hand.
[194:53.56]It'll be okay.
[194:54.26]They're coming.
[194:54.80]We're going to have to cut it off.
[194:57.50]They said if they lift the truck, you'll die.
[195:00.44]This is the last time we'll talk.
[195:02.41]Okay.
[195:03.83]Listen to me.
[195:05.85]I don't want you to have any of my money.
[195:07.95]I want it all go to Otto.
[195:11.57]I'll die if you do this.
[195:14.59]Eat my ass.
[195:15.55]Alright, alright.
[195:20.39]Flip it.
[195:20.71]Get off it, Alex.
[195:21.53]Flip it.
[195:21.87]Flip it.
[195:22.25]Just flip it.
[195:22.81]Bop it.
[195:23.31]Twist it.
[195:24.27]Turn it.
[195:24.90]Bop it.
[195:26.45]Oh, I got it perfect.
[195:27.88]I got it perfect.
[195:37.24]You actually, I'm in your ass right now.
[195:41.52]Oh yeah, lift it up.
[195:42.16]It's pulling his head closer.
[195:44.64]Alright.
[195:46.42]I'm being suffocated by his ass.
[195:53.46]What a way to go.
[195:55.34]I thought it was the truck!
[195:58.50]I can lift it!
[196:01.00]I can lift it!
[196:01.77]This is fucked up.
[196:05.19]Can you not get out?
[196:06.29]No, I'm stuck in here.
[196:07.37]You're good, you're good.
[196:07.99]Alright, here we go.
[196:13.42]So what do we do with the coal now?
[196:15.30]You take two pieces of coal, and then walk forward into this fan.
[196:19.10]Because we gotta bring them to the furnaces.
[196:22.21]Did you do all this by hand, each one of these?
[196:25.35]Yes, I put all of them.
[196:26.35]Holy shit, you were bored.
[196:27.73]No, there's a conveyor belt that drops them into the back of the truck.
[196:30.76]Oh, okay.
[196:31.00]I was going to say you did this one by one.
[196:32.34]Manually just take them.
[196:33.68]Yeah.
[196:34.16]No.
[196:35.22]Either way, I tell you it was a... How did I end up doing it?
[196:37.86]It's so loud.
[196:38.30]That's weird.
[196:49.33]But yes, he was very bored.
[196:52.83]Yes.
[196:53.89]Alright.
[196:54.13]So we're filling which one up?
[196:55.47]Does it matter?
[196:56.05]I think the last one.
[196:57.35]They all have to be maxed to full.
[197:00.90]You just get it in there.
[197:05.86]Time for dinner.
[197:06.56]Alright.
[197:08.70]We need one more.
[197:09.64]That's it.
[197:09.92]Nice day at work.
[197:11.54]Well, that's it.
[197:12.16]All done.
[197:13.00]Burn me.
[197:13.47]Burn me.
[197:16.50]Alright, so now what do we do?
[197:17.64]We just turned it on.
[197:18.76]You need to go in there and take some out.
[197:20.92]Why?
[197:21.08]Well, this is all the way to max.
[197:24.30]Steam is billowing now where it wasn't billowing before.
[197:26.76]So it's something to do with this little pipe valve.
[197:32.25]Should we breathe it in as hard as we can?
[197:35.69]Uh-huh.
[197:36.19]That's how you get workers' comp.
[197:38.87]So, do we have to stuff that with something?
[197:44.18]Maybe I should hold this thing up and just explode the whole thing.
[197:48.35]Actually, could work.
[197:53.45]Can we destroy everyone's livelihood now, yes?
[197:58.12]No, it's not going to work.
[198:01.04]That's connected to something over here, though.
[198:03.12]Isn't it?
[198:04.74]What else is this pipe connected to?
[198:08.56]The door?
[198:09.04]No, it's just these things.
[198:15.93]Have you been back behind this door?
[198:17.33]The fan?
[198:17.53]What?
[198:22.88]How did I?
[198:23.68]Hold on.
[198:24.39]Okay, that's pretty cool.
[198:26.77]I'm skydiving.
[198:27.53]We're doing a skydiving simulation in this first tower.
[198:34.05]Alright, so there's two fans down there.
[198:43.42]Are the fans higher pressure?
[198:44.86]Sorry, I cannot hear anything.
[198:47.12]It looks like we have to go inside of these things.
[198:54.01]Okay, yep.
[198:55.09]Okay, so you've got to go in the first Homer Simpson job.
[198:59.49]The first Homer Simpson job.
[199:01.77]Into the second Homer Simpson job.
[199:03.50]Yeah, it didn't lift you that much before.
[199:10.48]And that should take you to the third Homer Simpson job, it looks like.
[199:13.62]Okay, well.
[199:14.98]This looks kind of far, though.
[199:15.96]I don't know if I believe this.
[199:19.56]No, I believe it.
[199:23.30]I believe it.
[199:25.69]I don't know about that.
[199:26.63]You got to skate around the left.
[199:29.71]Ah, right, right, right.
[199:30.61]This is called skating, by the way.
[199:34.87]Skating?
[199:36.22]Yes.
[199:38.00]Hold on.
[199:42.24]Is that it?
[199:43.80]That's it.
[199:45.98]Dude, you could totally just, like, you got to get the speed run strap.
[199:50.45]Perfect launch into that tube.
[199:51.75]Ooh.
[199:56.77]um alright uh okay oh this is that one game where you connect all the dots you connect at the end of the game it tells you you wasted your time uh can I grab a drink can we take can we take like a pee break uh okay he's talking about the braid game no um I'll be right back isn't that made by the same guy yeah yeah made by braid guy
[200:24.57]Uh, window.
[200:25.55]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[200:26.95]Don't do it.
[200:41.47]Aw.
[200:42.67]He'll come back.
[200:43.53]No.
[200:45.65]Accept your fate.
[200:46.87]He is back.
[200:47.67]He's being a dingbat.
[200:49.75]We just wanted to kill him.
[200:52.32]That was a drink break?
[200:53.50]I didn't leave yet, and I saw what he was doing.
[200:55.14]And now I'm leaving.
[200:56.10]Be right back.
[200:57.82]Just reset the level.
[201:05.26]Get him.
[201:05.56]Get him.
[201:05.82]Get him.
[201:06.08]Get him.
[201:10.51]Choke him.
[201:11.03]Choke hold him.
[201:13.03]Alright.
[201:13.33]Directly on the other side.
[201:21.83]Squashing.
[201:22.25]Squashing.
[201:22.47]That worked so easily the first time.
[201:30.17]Why... The first time it went on the first try.
[201:34.59]Etalyx let everyone down.
[201:39.44]Reach.
[201:44.60]This is like an actual merry-go-round theme park.
[202:00.37]If you've got another idea, I'm open.
[202:05.43]He just bounced off of it.
[202:07.17]Alright, I'm getting a drink too.
[202:09.27]You're so strong.
[202:10.21]Mwah.
[202:33.67]Nah, forget it.
[203:04.74]So, let's see.
[203:05.20]Let's see how funny it was.
[203:06.12]What'd they do?
[203:09.22]What's the wicked funny thing?
[203:14.00]Okay, so what happened?
[203:17.91]What?
[203:18.05]They're not listening to me anymore.
[203:20.85]I was muted and he left.
[203:23.75]The wicked funny thing is I think we need this to not be flipped over.
[203:28.87]Dude, look at this cool Nintendo Labo piece.
[203:30.95]I made one of these last night, or two nights ago.
[203:33.51]Oh, by the way, uh, Nintendo Labo's gonna pick back up again on Friday.
[203:36.85]Gonna be making some more fun things.
[203:41.02]Sellout.
[203:46.58]And then on Saturday, gonna be finishing up that emote contest.
[203:50.47]Make sure you stick around for that one.
[203:51.89]Gonna be a little surprise there at the end of that stream.
[203:55.69]What, you're actually gonna pay an artist?
[203:58.38]I am paying them.
[204:00.40]It shows how much you pay attention.
[204:03.71]That shows how much you're paying attention.
[204:06.25]Just let me do my jokes.
[204:09.09]By the way, nice penis sensor bar, whatever that is.
[204:13.09]That's what it is.
[204:13.71]So are we waiting for Mr. Italian?
[204:23.68]Maybe.
[204:24.94]So how much more do you want to play?
[204:27.09]I don't know.
[204:27.81]I mean, how long are we even going?
[204:29.55]Three and a half hours.
[204:36.00]Wow!
[204:36.20]Let's get to the end of this level and see how we feel.
[204:38.46]Okay.
[204:39.24]This looks like a big one.
[204:40.28]This is a big one.
[204:43.84]Wait, this is the last level.
[204:45.22]Like, actually, for real, the last level.
[204:49.01]What?
[204:51.09]Is it really?
[204:53.99]Oh, this is the end of the game.
[205:00.79]Easy enough.
[205:01.29]Looks like we're going to finish the game.
[205:07.65]You can totally climb all the way up this tree, but... Hold on.
[205:12.52]Can we get this?
[205:15.24]Actually, you know what?
[205:15.90]I'm going to take this opportunity to just let my hands rest.
[205:18.34]I know, right?
[205:21.79]Take the opportunity to hang out for me.
[205:22.87]But I have to go.
[205:23.67]I have to go, go, go, go, go.
[205:25.47]No, I'm telling you, you're not going to, you're going to be really upset with yourself that you didn't give your hands the rest that they deserve for this last heart.
[205:30.45]You're going to be upset with yourself that you let me do everything.
[205:36.30]You know what?
[205:36.76]Yeah, you're right.
[205:37.58]My hands actually, no, you're right on this one.
[205:42.04]This is rough on the hands game.
[205:44.18]Let's just chill and have a podcast.
[205:50.88]Okay.
[205:51.24]What's the topic of the podcast?
[205:54.28]Uh... Worst vegetable.
[205:58.40]Oh.
[205:58.92]I'm gonna have to go with, uh, Brussels sprouts on this one.
[206:01.57]So damn hard to cook.
[206:02.85]Can't ever get them right and they stink.
[206:04.13]Hmm.
[206:08.43]There's a lot of gross ones, but I can't think of any right now.
[206:12.13]Brussels sprouts are pretty gross.
[206:13.53]Celery's the worst?
[206:14.29]Yeah, but celery's easy.
[206:16.09]You just crunch it and it turns into water.
[206:17.59]It's like 79,000% water anyways.
[206:22.71]Uh, I really hate asparagus.
[206:24.28]Pickles.
[206:25.50]Pickles.
[206:26.30]You don't like pickles?
[206:28.00]They put them on... They put them in with every sandwich and they don't... No.
[206:30.80]Number two pickles.
[206:33.16]Number one tomatoes.
[206:35.50]Don't put a tomato on my fucking sandwich.
[206:37.51]I mean, I agree with that, but I think tomatoes are good in certain... Do you like spaghetti sauce?
[206:40.57]I mean...
[206:41.80]I like the sauces made from them.
[206:43.82]Liar, sure.
[206:44.50]So he's a liar.
[206:46.07]But, but, if tomatoes stopped existing, I'd move on.
[206:50.19]Like, I'd get on with my life.
[206:52.19]Aren't tomatoes a fruit?
[206:54.01]Yeah, they are.
[206:55.69]Just played yourself.
[206:57.55]I did.
[206:58.49]Alright, so we're going over this way.
[206:59.98]By the way, Etalyx, this is the last level, so we're done after this.
[207:02.80]What, what?
[207:03.32]This is the final level of the game.
[207:05.40]Really?
[207:05.74]Oh, yeah.
[207:06.68]That's it?
[207:08.44]This is it.
[207:10.69]I'm actually stuck in this tree.
[207:13.11]Are you seriously climbing the tree right now?
[207:18.48]Is this how you're going to do this?
[207:19.52]This is how it ends.
[207:20.42]He just wants to ride the theme park.
[207:24.44]Don't vomit back and forth ride.
[207:26.66]The pirate ship.
[207:28.54]The worst ride ever.
[207:31.26]Who invented that?
[207:34.24]It just gives you a state of throw up every time it reaches the apex.
[207:39.34]All those fucked up carnival rides.
[207:40.61]If you're not in the middle of that ride, you're having a bad time.
[207:43.05]No, you aren't having a bad time no matter what.
[207:46.15]That shit sucks.
[207:55.23]That's a lot.
[207:57.24]I don't think this is gonna work.
[208:00.30]I think you're raspy at straws right now.
[208:02.20]I haven't seen the Monkey King work.
[208:03.62]I haven't seen my magic.
[208:09.80]And they always play some old classic 80s rock song.
[208:18.83]Right when the pirate ship starts, it's like, I want to rock!
[208:22.09]I want to rock!
[208:26.19]Rock!
[208:26.79]And if you work there, you hear that all day, and then you go home and you die.
[208:30.65]It's on a 30 second loop.
[208:33.42]It's on the copyright allowed loop.
[208:37.01]That's as much as they could get in without getting a copyright strike.
[208:41.95]Alright, can we?
[208:45.47]Let's go.
[208:46.71]Let's go.
[208:47.47]Let's do the level.
[208:49.55]We're not climbing trees to skip 85% of it.
[208:52.10]It just took a screenshot of me.
[208:54.42]Well, you're supposed to be able to get on top of this anyway somehow, because look, there's this whole situation over here where you should be able to climb on top of that.
[209:00.32]Alright, I got an idea.
[209:03.44]Somebody, one person to get on one end of this pole.
[209:06.98]And the other two people pick him up and raise him to the top of the tree.
[209:11.20]Have you guys had anything to drink?
[209:12.26]Any water?
[209:14.16]I just got a... I've had half a coffee.
[209:16.82]Give me this.
[209:17.25]That's a diuretic.
[209:17.93]Give me this.
[209:18.41]It's going to dry you out, man.
[209:20.99]So we're wedging underneath?
[209:22.21]Yep.
[209:23.59]We've got to wedge it underneath the other wedger.
[209:25.47]I'm getting the other wedger.
[209:26.65]I'm getting the other wedger.
[209:28.75]Fine.
[209:29.09]Get it.
[209:30.91]I think we both realized at the same time.
[209:35.69]That's a myth and then you go Bingo and it's down
[209:53.82]Is there no sound effects anymore?
[209:55.62]I just heard a little creak.
[209:57.58]I think we need those again.
[209:58.38]Yeah, we need those over here so we can bend it into the wall and do a crowbar action here.
[210:03.09]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[210:06.90]No, you're staying with the team this time.
[210:08.26]You're not just going to go do your own thing.
[210:09.78]I want to figure out how you get on top of that.
[210:11.60]No, no, no.
[210:12.78]Just get over here.
[210:15.46]But look, you get on top of the tree that way.
[210:17.61]It looks really fun.
[210:18.43]They made it for you.
[210:19.31]It looks very fun, I know.
[210:20.51]The giant swingy thingy is over there.
[210:23.73]I want to go on the giant swingy thingy.
[210:26.83]You can go on the giant swing after we're done with this, I promise.
[210:29.54]Ugh.
[210:33.06]Now you're not getting to do anything.
[210:34.20]It'll be okay, little guy.
[210:35.76]Now you don't get to do anything.
[210:37.68]Now you're tied up.
[210:40.06]Now guess what you have to do.
[210:41.00]You're a designated wood holder.
[210:42.68]You made me wear pants.
[210:46.25]What?
[210:46.85]Pants?
[210:48.43]I didn't make you wear pants because you're naked.
[210:52.83]Thinks he's going to get an ice cream after this.
[210:54.63]Nope.
[210:56.21]He's going straight to bed.
[210:59.21]Right into the crib.
[211:04.17]I can't believe he's still in the crib after... Alright, now turn and tilt and twist.
[211:08.47]He just sleeps so well in there.
[211:11.01]I'm touching me.
[211:13.97]Alright, I think that's enough.
[211:22.53]Do we need this again?
[211:24.25]I don't know.
[211:24.99]We've needed it twice so far, so... Maybe bring in the Wedgems.
[211:29.64]Bring the Wedgems.
[211:32.71]We got a volcano scenario.
[211:35.35]One of them is stuck.
[211:39.21]Bumpy sounds.
[211:41.39]Doesn't hurt you though.
[211:45.53]I'm not going to go up there.
[211:46.35]Put your back into it.
[211:47.62]This is a volcano.
[211:49.58]Two cages.
[211:53.52]Bring in the legends.
[211:54.68]Let's see what's up here.
[211:57.54]I bet you pull one cage down.
[211:58.98]This is definitely a scale scenario.
[212:01.84]Yes, so wait, hold on.
[212:04.32]So we have to weigh this down.
[212:06.93]I'm fine.
[212:07.27]There's an opening on this one, though, so this one stays on the ground.
[212:12.55]Now, like, yeah, now you're stuck over there.
[212:14.91]Am I, or was I, was somebody supposed to come over here for a reason?
[212:21.21]Weigh, weigh him down, weigh him down, weigh him down.
[212:24.95]So, uh, we need some weight.
[212:34.17]Okay, now we bring the other one up.
[212:36.77]It looks like I can go up.
[212:37.77]Let me go up here.
[212:39.13]Go on the other one.
[212:40.05]Go on the other one.
[212:40.83]And then use wedge between them, and then it'll keep them both height.
[212:43.91]And then I think that'll do something.
[212:46.32]I don't know what it'll do, but I'm feeling it.
[212:47.90]I'm feeling it.
[212:48.84]Alright, I'm on the other one.
[212:50.66]High enough for this.
[212:51.82]I'm as heavy as I can be.
[212:52.92]I can't reach that.
[212:55.32]That's all I got.
[212:56.16]Anything else over here?
[212:56.92]Okay, there's like a star way to go over here.
[213:01.14]I don't even want to know this exists.
[213:04.47]What are you trying to say?
[213:05.61]There's like a look at star over here.
[213:07.89]Can both of you weigh that one down?
[213:09.59]Like together?
[213:10.43]Yeah.
[213:12.17]You know what I'm saying?
[213:16.29]Alright, let's get it and weigh it down.
[213:19.61]Weight.
[213:19.81]Together.
[213:20.11]So what is this going to do for you?
[213:24.57]He's going to try and raise up both of them and then stick the stick in between them so that both of them are the same height.
[213:31.69]Right.
[213:33.46]I think it's long enough.
[213:35.22]Should I lift it up a little?
[213:36.26]Get out of that one?
[213:36.90]So you need to weigh the other one down.
[213:46.47]Okay.
[213:49.51]I don't know why I'm doing this.
[213:51.13]I don't either, but I'm supporting you in your... I think we have to get, like, up here.
[213:55.45]Yeah, shouldn't I have to put up one of them so they can't drop?
[213:58.01]Guys, guys, guys.
[213:59.12]There's a box over here.
[214:00.96]Hmm.
[214:01.06]Hmm.
[214:02.97]There's a box right here.
[214:03.55]Well, you can use that for some weight.
[214:04.69]You can definitely use this for some reason.
[214:08.17]Whatever reason that is, I don't fucking know.
[214:11.81]I mean, I think we had the right idea.
[214:13.69]Alright, it's down there.
[214:14.89]Okay, well, it's down there now.
[214:17.45]I think we have to get the box all the way over to where that little ledge is.
[214:21.98]Yes, all the way to the right.
[214:24.60]So I need this one way down, if you could please.
[214:31.24]Coming, honey.
[214:32.36]If you would, then you two need to poo in that.
[214:38.46]What are you?
[214:38.96]What accident?
[214:40.05]I don't know.
[214:40.43]I was just saying poo in that.
[214:41.91]But that's not what I was trying to say.
[214:43.19]Do that.
[214:44.19]So you said can you poo in that?
[214:46.13]Yes.
[214:46.27]Okay.
[214:47.47]Just trying to be clear.
[214:48.95]So you guys have to wave me down.
[214:52.13]So then I can walk across.
[214:54.29]And my game is frozen.
[214:56.47]Star's character, stop moving.
[214:57.78]Star.
[214:58.36]Oh.
[215:00.05]He's not moving.
[215:03.33]Also, when this happens, we can't hear him if he's talking.
[215:07.42]Like, is he, hello?
[215:09.16]Apparently Star Stream is dunzo.
[215:11.30]Uh-oh.
[215:11.56]I think Star is completely dunzo.
[215:14.70]Uh-oh.
[215:16.26]Oh, no.
[215:17.98]Is the surfer dead?
[215:19.72]Yep.
[215:20.92]Oh, no.
[215:21.52]Oh, last level.
[215:23.96]If only we would have cheesed it faster.
[215:25.85]If only we cheesed it faster.
[215:29.11]I don't know if our progress saves here.
[215:31.65]I think it does.
[215:32.90]Well, maybe not on that level, but we can restart from that level.
[215:37.92]Well, sorry about that.
[215:49.85]Call him?
[215:50.27]No, we know.
[215:50.87]He'll be back.
[215:52.13]Check his Twitter.
[215:56.21]He immediately is like, quick, tell him I have no means of communication.
[215:59.52]Tell him that I crashed.
[216:00.52]He'll be back.
[216:08.43]Give it a moment.
[216:11.93]Hey, he retweeted my tweet from earlier.
[216:14.01]He actually texted me.
[216:15.17]He said...
[216:17.31]uh hold on there it is he said hey uh blue screen of death because I forgot to put my ram in correctly I wish you were here to install it correctly for me because you made you built the computer and you're so much better at it than I am thanks man just uh reseat it and you'll be okay not to put you on blast on stream why are you doing that to me but uh is it or is it not true that you did not build your last computer I build all my pcs from scratch
[216:48.64]Is it or is it not true that the computer upon which you are streaming right now is one that you did not build?
[216:53.19]I mean, I build all my computers from scratch, but sometimes you have a little bit of customization from an outside third-party source.
[217:00.63]I build all my PCs from scratch, though.
[217:02.45]I pick the parts.
[217:03.93]I pick out where I want them to go.
[217:05.97]I may or may not have some third-party help in the process, but I build all the PCs, I pick all the parts, and I make sure they're all correct, and I make sure they're seated well.
[217:12.98]So you seem to be mentioning a lot of picking parts.
[217:16.88]Right.
[217:17.97]Maybe does the name Part Picker ring a bell?
[217:22.85]I think most computer enthusiasts will use Part Picker.
[217:26.15]It's a way to pick your parts.
[217:28.17]But do most computer enthusiasts using Part Picker then go to the linked websites to have them assembled after?
[217:34.03]Are you making fun of me?
[217:36.50]No, I mean, it depends on if you want to include a third party to help you customize the parts and the computer that you decided to build.
[217:45.43]If I wanted a decal on here, like a window or something, I would need somebody else to do that.
[217:49.88]I don't have the capabilities to make that.
[217:52.88]I see.
[217:53.38]If I wanted somebody to seat my motherboard into a case, and then put the CPU, the RAM, the graphics card, the hard drive, plug them all into the motherboard, and then post it and try to make sure it works, and then take that and install the operating system on it, and then I come in and pick it up.
[218:11.27]If that happens, then that's one small step, right?
[218:17.90]Gotcha.
[218:18.40]Okay.
[218:18.62]Just want to make sure we were all clear here.
[218:21.20]Alright.
[218:21.72]Are you like a live star?
[218:23.84]My computer crashed.
[218:25.06]I'm done.
[218:25.92]This is the real life.
[218:27.16]I'm done.
[218:31.10]My computer crashed.
[218:32.98]I'm done.
[218:33.60]I don't know.
[218:34.36]We were towards the end anyway.
[218:36.02]My hands really hurt.
[218:37.77]And you just yawned.
[218:39.01]You just yawned.
[218:40.23]No, I went, uh, and I put my fingers on my head.
[218:42.11]No, you yawned.
[218:42.49]You're tired.
[218:43.21]I think Jerm is tired.
[218:43.95]He wanted to go.
[218:46.45]I'm just taking a dive for him.
[218:50.19]Alright, well, I guess that's it.
[218:55.12]Hmm.
[219:00.06]Star is too tired to finish the last level.
[219:05.51]Oh, I know what the real reason is, but I can't say.
[219:08.57]Because he didn't get his PC computer put on the right way.
[219:13.47]Alright, hold on.
[219:14.63]Wait, Etalyx.
[219:15.03]Can we do this together?
[219:15.83]Can we just beat the game?
[219:16.71]Like, we have to beat this.
[219:17.59]Yeah, I think so.
[219:18.91]Yeah, I mean, you weren't playing with me anyway, so... So, Star, are you gonna, like, stay for moral support, or are you running away?
[219:25.99]Um... I could stay for moral support.
[219:30.95]Why don't you morally support us in our endeavor?
[219:34.35]Was that really the last level?
[219:35.67]That was the final level.
[219:37.83]How do we... Was Chad just saying that it was the final level?
[219:39.98]No, I kept back.
[219:40.64]That apparently is the last level.
[219:47.45]Alright, make the game, Alex.
[219:49.49]We can't just... We have to end the game.
[219:54.40]Actually, it really is the last level.
[219:55.84]That's the last one.
[219:56.46]Alright, Star, why don't you just come in the game and just walk behind us?
[220:02.46]That's what I'm doing.
[220:04.09]I'm loading it up.
[220:04.97]Jeez.
[220:05.49]Are you still streaming?
[220:07.49]No.
[220:08.31]So you turned off your stream.
[220:10.07]No, my whole computer crashed, so my stream turned off.
[220:12.75]Oh, right, right.
[220:13.35]You're not like, okay...
[220:16.00]Alright, well, you want to host the talk?
[220:17.45]What do you want me to do?
[220:18.63]Mm-hmm.
[220:20.17]I am hosting it right now.
[220:21.97]What's the name of your game?
[220:24.45]I mean, it's just, it's my, it's my username.
[220:27.09]What is your username?
[220:29.37]You just click on friends, and I'm on there.
[220:33.51]I know, but like, what is your username right now?
[220:38.67]Etal.
[220:39.51]Okay, I thought, it's not, it's not Gasp?
[220:43.38]No.
[220:43.88]So you're not listed here, then?
[220:46.68]I'm in the game stirs in here.
[220:50.29]He's here.
[220:51.97]Are you appearing offline or anything?
[220:55.05]Jerma I can join join his game.
[220:57.37]That's what I'm doing.
[220:59.35]How come you didn't list in the server?
[221:03.03]How come what how can be enlisted in the server I Didn't know you felt this way about me Right did it the same way.
[221:11.36]I
[221:12.92]That we've been doing the whole night.
[221:14.32]Friends are not public servers, you dense idiot.
[221:16.40]Well, what was Star's server the whole time?
[221:18.90]I got through on the friends list.
[221:21.06]Star's server was popping up in my browser.
[221:23.04]That can be corroborated with the stream here.
[221:24.62]What are you talking about?
[221:26.36]Star's stream, the whole thing was there for me to click on.
[221:29.30]Don't call me dense.
[221:30.04]I have no idea what you were doing before.
[221:33.34]Because his was public.
[221:34.21]Well, I don't know he was made.
[221:35.49]How am I supposed to know that?
[221:38.02]alright so he's not gonna help us so he's gonna just play I'm doing that thing that parkour people do where they stretch their body out and they show how muscly they are he told me to go to friends I don't give I don't give up what he told me to do you know what I mean excuse me you know what in my neck in the woods you know we call that we call that
[222:07.93]What are you talking about?
[222:08.83]We have to knock this thing down.
[222:10.05]Let's do the level.
[222:11.13]No, no, no.
[222:11.69]I had an epiphany.
[222:13.19]Yeah, what is it?
[222:14.09]Help me do my epiphany first.
[222:17.29]You're going to make me play this stupid game with you.
[222:20.22]Okay, first of all, it was your idea.
[222:25.72]You have a really gross body, by the way.
[222:28.70]No, let's get that straight right out of the game.
[222:31.65]Why is his body so gross?
[222:33.33]Jesus Christ.
[222:35.01]Do you see how there's a hole underneath the thing there?
[222:38.31]Yes, I see that up there.
[222:39.91]Yeah, I want to slide the long pole up there with the leverage of those bricks.
[222:46.04]Oh my God.
[222:46.82]And you wanted to quit the game.
[222:49.20]You want to do like the weird, complicated shit.
[222:50.98]Like, I'm done.
[222:51.82]How is this weird and complicated?
[222:53.42]Because you'll see.
[222:55.56]You'll see how.
[222:57.34]I will.
[222:58.66]Okay, so you want to push that up here.
[223:01.94]And let that drop.
[223:03.58]Uh-huh.
[223:04.98]Okay, um... Um, pull, uh... Corner pocket.
[223:10.97]I think these need to be here more.
[223:13.57]I'm just gonna let you do it.
[223:14.97]Yeah.
[223:15.95]So I don't mess it up.
[223:17.93]You're messing it up!
[223:20.29]Nobody touched anything!
[223:22.99]Can you stop?
[223:24.10]Nobody has touched a single thing since you've gone over there.
[223:27.62]Can you please?
[223:29.66]Can you help me flip this?
[223:31.14]I'll help you.
[223:31.68]No, he'll do it.
[223:32.08]He will.
[223:33.37]I want it to be tall ways.
[223:34.51]Can you stop?
[223:35.07]Can you stop doing this?
[223:36.03]Can you leave it alone?
[223:44.49]This is the unflippable brick.
[223:49.44]I'm pulling a...
[223:53.61]Why are we counting?
[223:54.29]What's going on here?
[223:55.27]You said this was going to be easy.
[223:57.53]It was going to be easy, because we're supposed to go wedge it under there.
[224:00.56]That way, yeah.
[224:02.02]Hold on.
[224:03.28]We do it this way.
[224:03.88]I'm going to take the fucking initiative.
[224:04.90]Pass it up to me.
[224:06.74]Taking the initiative here.
[224:07.78]I mean, like, Jesus.
[224:18.45]Okay, okay.
[224:20.47]Ball's in your court.
[224:23.71]I don't even know if this thing is long enough.
[224:37.34]Was Jerma taking the long stick?
[224:39.64]I tell you, I'm going to do the initiative.
[224:42.04]We need this.
[224:42.90]There's one over here for you already.
[224:44.84]Hey, look at this.
[224:53.31]You can get it back once I... I'm going to do the U. Here, there's three of them.
[224:58.67]Will you just stack three?
[225:00.79]Stack three.
[225:02.55]Why is this all numbers here?
[225:05.47]Why are we just counting now?
[225:06.51]What happened?
[225:06.99]What are you talking about?
[225:09.66]My chatter being funny people.
[225:11.82]My chatter.
[225:12.68]Hey, you actually were grammatically correct.
[225:14.10]My chat are.
[225:15.42]That's what I said.
[225:15.88]My chat are.
[225:17.10]I know.
[225:17.30]I said, hey, you were grammatically correct.
[225:20.09]Usually you aren't.
[225:20.81]Usually you say very dumb, bin-witted things.
[225:23.61]That's interesting.
[225:24.05]When was the last time we talked?
[225:27.23]Like... Um... I don't know.
[225:33.18]Usually you say those things.
[225:34.86]Huh?
[225:37.38]Where have you been?
[225:39.44]Alright, let me go.
[225:40.92]You got it?
[225:42.04]I can't do this on my own.
[225:47.32]Just do this for me so I can be done with it.
[225:51.00]Just let me be done with it, please.
[225:58.10]I got you.
[226:00.14]I got you.
[226:01.28]Push it.
[226:03.06]I'm pulling it towards us.
[226:05.54]We need more leverage.
[226:06.42]We need more.
[226:08.34]Raise the top one.
[226:18.53]Give me this long stick Mine take it fine.
[226:25.23]Do you you used it for too long?
[226:26.63]Alright, do the thing you want to do you want to balance that up there?
[226:31.56]How is that gonna balance up there?
[226:33.42]That's gonna be impossible.
[226:35.20]Wouldn't you like to know ah, ah, ah
[226:41.08]Okay.
[226:41.30]Okay.
[226:41.56]Okay.
[226:41.90]Okay.
[226:42.10]Okay.
[226:42.47]Okay.
[226:42.79]Pass it up to me.
[226:43.87]Pass it up to me.
[226:46.31]Pass the savings on to me.
[226:49.29]I need someone to help me lift it.
[226:51.53]You need a... Are you saying you need a third person over there?
[226:53.79]Okay.
[226:54.07]Here it is.
[226:54.41]I fell.
[226:56.57]You got... Alright.
[227:00.43]Take it.
[227:02.35]Take this.
[227:04.09]Do what you must.
[227:06.78]Don't fall.
[227:07.06]How did you guys do this the first time?
[227:10.35]Okay.
[227:11.21]Now which way would you like me to go?
[227:14.49]How are you supposed to do that with one person?
[227:17.03]You're not.
[227:17.37]You're supposed to do it with like three.
[227:20.42]So do you want to lay it on top of that?
[227:22.78]Yeah, I want to lay it on top of these bricks.
[227:25.88]This is hard.
[227:26.16]Yeah.
[227:34.54]Yeah, this is almost, it's like, it's almost as if you're not supposed to do it this way.
[227:40.16]You know, it may have something to do with not doing it like this.
[227:45.42]Other way, rotate towards the middle.
[227:47.38]Just want to go straight up on top of this.
[227:50.05]Alex, can you push your hands up here?
[227:54.81]No.
[227:56.13]You're all stupid monkeys.
[227:58.27]I'm done.
[227:59.21]I'm done with this.
[228:04.81]Alright, let's go.
[228:07.17]Let's do it.
[228:09.11]You had your chance.
[228:14.96]We need to go through.
[228:17.86]Go get the box.
[228:18.78]Don't crash.
[228:25.06]No, it wasn't supposed to be like this.
[228:27.81]I wasn't supposed to be the one to fall off this.
[228:29.69]Alright.
[228:30.87]I'm going to get the box.
[228:41.56]Can we fit through this?
[228:46.80]Help!
[228:47.06]What are you guys doing over there?
[228:50.00]Etalyx isn't doing anything.
[228:52.29]He's standing still.
[228:53.49]Oh, he might be talking.
[228:54.63]Alright, get through that.
[228:56.69]You can talk and move at the same time.
[228:59.61]It's hard.
[229:00.01]It's like chewing gum and walking.
[229:04.62]What?
[229:05.80]You never chewed gum and walked at the same time?
[229:07.28]You have to think about it.
[229:08.08]It's very hard.
[229:13.43]Not once has that been a problem in my life.
[229:17.55]Okay, I got the box.
[229:23.45]Box.
[229:24.41]Got it.
[229:27.34]We need to get the box over here.
[229:30.08]Don't worry, I'm sure your good friend Etalyx will come help you any second.
[229:33.52]What do you need?
[229:34.44]I have the box.
[229:35.04]I've been watching you struggle.
[229:38.18]Maybe you should use my help.
[229:38.82]I'm struggling.
[229:40.16]I could use your help.
[229:41.30]I need help over here.
[229:42.32]Is that an invitation?
[229:43.12]Wait, who?
[229:44.24]Just pass them up to me.
[229:46.80]Just go through the thing.
[229:48.62]Go through the thing.
[229:52.24]By the way, I'm being accused of cheating.
[229:55.26]Cheating?
[229:56.52]Yeah, I've been told that for some reason there's a red dot.
[229:59.78]Is there a red dot on the top right of you guys' screens?
[230:02.50]Is that making you, like, recording?
[230:05.27]I don't know.
[230:05.69]Are you being recorded?
[230:10.53]Uh-oh.
[230:11.11]I need someone to help me.
[230:13.47]I need Etalyx to help me.
[230:15.13]No, I need Etalyx to help me.
[230:16.83]Alright, well, the bidding is starting at $100.
[230:19.23]$5,000.
[230:19.41]Oh, wait, I went a little too high.
[230:24.64]One BTC.
[230:26.58]Oh, shit.
[230:27.32]That's kind of too high for me.
[230:31.12]I just need to... I'm gonna get this damn thing over here by myself.
[230:37.48]Just watch.
[230:38.66]Let's get this thing over here.
[230:39.58]Oh, my God.
[230:39.92]You did that in one try.
[230:41.76]I did, yeah.
[230:43.48]So I got a pro gamer over here.
[230:44.79]Fuck me.
[230:45.89]I need help over here.
[230:46.87]This is a two-person job.
[230:51.37]Okay, so what's the red dot?
[230:52.41]I don't know.
[230:56.12]Did you pirate the game?
[230:57.26]Like, I don't understand.
[230:58.83]Like, what is that?
[231:00.29]No.
[231:00.45]Apparently it's new because I'm just now being accused of it.
[231:03.87]So it's new.
[231:06.99]Oh, it's my mute button.
[231:09.35]Oh, I thought that meant you were the host.
[231:10.71]Oh, yeah, you're here.
[231:11.29]Okay, good.
[231:12.01]So stand in this.
[231:13.33]Okay, I fixed it.
[231:15.13]Apparently it's a hotkey.
[231:16.13]Alright.
[231:18.31]You just put the weight on that side.
[231:20.75]Get the weight on the right side.
[231:23.55]And then I'm going to grab the box out of here.
[231:25.70]No, what are you doing?
[231:27.20]You said to wait on that side.
[231:28.48]I said to wait on the right side.
[231:31.02]I did it!
[231:32.10]I heard that.
[231:34.33]I'm going this way now.
[231:36.21]I got on the tree.
[231:37.87]I'm the guy!
[231:39.47]And you did it because of me.
[231:41.35]Congratulations, you made it to the tree.
[231:44.11]All it cost me was $7,000.
[231:48.01]Recording equals cheat.
[231:52.02]No, no, no, no, no.
[231:53.74]I'm stuck.
[231:54.36]I'm stuck in here.
[231:58.73]I'm just like trying to rush because like... Where'd our third go, man?
[232:06.81]We squatted up with threes and then we queue up with fours.
[232:10.07]It's fucking ridiculous, man.
[232:11.15]Where's our third guy?
[232:11.85]Are we playing PUBG Mobile after this?
[232:23.80]Do you need some help over here?
[232:24.92]Yes, I do.
[232:26.06]Okay, well, get off of it first.
[232:26.96]No, no, no, you get off.
[232:27.82]What do you mean?
[232:29.26]It's going to fall down.
[232:30.11]No, it'll be okay.
[232:31.05]I'm the only thing keeping it up.
[232:31.97]Yeah, but I already have my hands on it, so I got to just... Now you're just like, oh, come pull it with me.
[232:38.55]There we go, okay.
[232:39.55]So now I'm going to bring this over here.
[232:41.09]Okay, now you weigh this down more.
[232:45.38]You got to weigh this down.
[232:52.79]Okay, you got it.
[232:53.55]Describe what you're doing.
[232:54.77]Update every 10 seconds.
[232:55.85]So you go update every 10 seconds.
[232:57.49]We're currently moving the Brock.
[233:00.31]The Brock?
[233:01.25]Alright, the Brock?
[233:02.17]The Block!
[233:04.95]Alright, now you can jump from here to there.
[233:07.15]And we've just completed part 2.
[233:10.66]Is this chapter 2?
[233:11.30]This looks like it's chapter 2 of the level.
[233:14.74]I gotta save.
[233:17.72]This is the big finale that everyone's been waiting for.
[233:24.27]So what do we do here?
[233:25.09]It's a daisy.
[233:27.77]Okay.
[233:28.19]Well, that falls.
[233:35.21]Block.
[233:35.73]Brick and block is Brock.
[233:38.33]Okay.
[233:38.63]I think I have to stand on this end.
[233:39.91]Yeah.
[233:40.31]So you get on this when you can.
[233:45.05]Does that jump on it?
[233:47.73]Now I think I... Can you get the box and actually catapult me into the other side?
[233:53.27]I think actually you can jump from here.
[233:55.13]Are you going to get the box?
[234:00.63]Yeah, I want to get the box.
[234:02.03]10 second update.
[234:02.57]We have a seesaw here.
[234:05.15]We have to get a box and use the seesaw to throw one of us over to the other side.
[234:08.91]Okay, go to the other side of the seesaw.
[234:16.95]Is he just having his own fun over there?
[234:18.49]What are you doing with that?
[234:22.37]Alright, you can drop the seesaw.
[234:24.49]Seesaw is going to get dropped.
[234:27.23]Okay.
[234:28.99]So now, you try jumping from there.
[234:34.18]How are we supposed to get this box?
[234:36.96]You're supposed to jump from all the stairs.
[234:39.84]Alright, weigh it down.
[234:44.83]Now I gotta do, like, the Mario run-up?
[234:46.83]There you go.
[234:47.21]10-second update.
[234:49.15]Okay, um, Etalyx is currently doing the... He's running up, he's jumping to the ledge, he grabbed it, and he's gonna get the box that's over here on the left.
[234:58.22]Okay, you can't really make that jump.
[234:59.97]Where is Star?
[235:01.31]I don't have no idea.
[235:03.39]He made it to the top of the tree.
[235:04.59]I think he may have left.
[235:05.37]Oh, you're supposed to use the stick to get across.
[235:07.43]I don't think he's even here anymore.
[235:08.55]I think he's just hosting the game.
[235:11.26]No, no.
[235:12.22]My wife wanted me to see what I was doing, so now I have to stream.
[235:18.22]She's forcing it.
[235:19.38]What?
[235:20.08]It's an issue now.
[235:22.04]Uh-oh.
[235:23.30]I didn't know we were getting into... Oh, God.
[235:27.32]You wedged it in here.
[235:28.84]I have wedged it in there.
[235:29.94]It wasn't intentional, though.
[235:32.62]You can't make that jump?
[235:35.07]You're supposed to use the stick.
[235:37.71]Can we un-wedge this?
[235:39.67]Damn it.
[235:40.53]See?
[235:40.85]I didn't even jump.
[235:41.91]You think I'm stupid?
[235:42.83]No, I didn't even jump.
[235:43.55]Hold on.
[235:43.73]Let me try again.
[235:49.81]How did it get so wedged?
[235:51.07]I don't know.
[235:55.66]Alright.
[235:55.98]Well, you're not...
[235:58.42]I tried to jump twice.
[235:59.52]You did great.
[236:00.48]Look, my hands are covered in a layer of water.
[236:05.20]Yeah, well, I have been too.
[236:06.45]There's actually a layer of water on my hands.
[236:09.53]I just dunked my fucking hands in slime.
[236:14.59]I'm in the same boat.
[236:15.41]You should try playing ping pong.
[236:20.67]I have.
[236:20.99]I was really bad at it.
[236:21.99]I'm not very good at it.
[236:24.34]I'm actually mad nice at ping pong, bro.
[236:26.28]Mad nice.
[236:29.48]So, funny story.
[236:30.32]I've actually played ping pong with Ster, but he doesn't remember.
[236:32.78]Have you?
[236:34.76]Was it at Twitch headquarters?
[236:36.18]It was at Twitch HQ.
[236:37.67]Actually, yeah, it was.
[236:39.53]No!
[236:40.23]Okay, so who remembers for real?
[236:41.93]Well, I remember the event.
[236:43.03]I don't remember the location.
[236:44.65]I remember we were there for... That was 2012.
[236:46.19]Got it.
[236:51.55]Also known as back in the day.
[236:53.81]also known as Magical Wizard Wars.
[236:57.09]Okay, I got the thing.
[236:58.69]Oh God, that was Magical Wizard Wars.
[237:00.31]I wanted that game to be good so badly.
[237:02.81]Funny about that, that's the mouse pad I'm using right now.
[237:05.27]It's still Magical Wizard Wars.
[237:07.37]Get a new one.
[237:08.69]I had that for like five years.
[237:10.13]It works pretty good.
[237:10.89]Hey, Star, look over here.
[237:12.17]It was a pretty good mouse pad.
[237:14.42]Do you see us?
[237:17.70]Where even are you here?
[237:22.37]Alright, I got the thing.
[237:22.95]Man, I'm in the fuckhole.
[237:26.51]Are you?
[237:27.03]Okay.
[237:27.47]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[237:28.69]This is going to fall.
[237:29.53]Oh, stop it from falling.
[237:30.56]It's harder than it needs to be.
[237:33.42]I wasn't pulling myself up.
[237:34.72]Okay, so you can jump.
[237:35.64]I'm going to make it.
[237:36.62]What is the actual objective here?
[237:38.16]The objective here is I'm going to even this out.
[237:40.18]You jump on top of the box and jump from the box to the other side.
[237:42.78]Oh, yeah.
[237:44.36]That's the objective.
[237:46.70]So, jump.
[237:50.10]Okay.
[237:51.00]Hold on.
[237:52.28]The stick has to be relevant somehow.
[237:55.13]Irrelevant.
[237:58.59]Oh, it is.
[237:59.29]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[238:00.49]Other way, other way.
[238:01.43]No!
[238:01.59]Come on!
[238:02.19]Oh, fuck.
[238:03.61]Oh, fuck.
[238:04.31]Pull it back.
[238:04.87]Pull it back.
[238:05.33]Stand on it now.
[238:06.57]You have to stand on it right now or this is over.
[238:09.39]Save this whole thing.
[238:11.55]I'm on the edge.
[238:12.13]You're not heavy enough.
[238:13.07]I'm on the edge.
[238:13.61]I'm not fat enough.
[238:15.79]You gotta use your might, man.
[238:17.17]Pull it back.
[238:17.89]I can't.
[238:18.31]Your legs are just dangling.
[238:19.57]Okay.
[238:20.73]Beyond belief, might, and magic.
[238:22.91]Is that the new game?
[238:24.31]Alright, now come to the side.
[238:25.43]Beyond Belief?
[238:26.45]Look, come to the side.
[238:27.67]Yeah, Ripley's Beyond Belief, my magic.
[238:29.99]Hold on.
[238:30.63]No, just do what I say.
[238:31.82]Do you want me to bring the cube?
[238:33.36]Stand on that side.
[238:34.84]No, stand on it.
[238:37.06]Stand on it.
[238:38.50]Okay?
[238:39.16]Oh god.
[238:39.56]Thank you.
[238:42.18]Actual puzzle solver here coming through.
[238:49.14]Eventually.
[238:50.22]Oh my god.
[238:53.25]You're gonna wedge it in?
[238:54.72]Hold on.
[238:55.44]Come on, wedge it in there, man.
[238:58.18]I fell.
[238:58.70]I don't know what happened here.
[238:59.78]I was touching my face.
[239:00.96]No!
[239:07.75]And he's back.
[239:08.23]Yay, he's here.
[239:09.19]No!
[239:09.71]Why am I here?
[239:12.43]Yeah, you're here now.
[239:13.67]Yay.
[239:14.47]No!
[239:16.10]Yep, deal with it, buddy.
[239:17.50]You gotta be here for a while.
[239:23.10]I don't want to be here.
[239:24.66]The game is saved.
[239:25.84]So the box is there if you're playing solo.
[239:28.88]The other place was so cool.
[239:31.63]This place has droids in it.
[239:34.75]Welcome.
[239:37.53]That's not fun.
[239:38.89]Hey, star.
[239:40.11]Why don't you make the jump?
[239:42.44]I want to go backwards.
[239:43.66]The sooner you do this, the sooner we finish the level.
[239:46.18]It's only appropriate that this is your finale.
[239:51.38]I don't know.
[239:51.90]I jumped twice in the air.
[239:55.13]I gotta play with you guys now.
[239:57.26]Yep.
[239:57.80]But where I was, there was giant cool swinger doodles.
[240:02.62]You'll see them again.
[240:03.56]Don't worry.
[240:05.14]I don't know.
[240:05.64]So you have to... What are you doing with this?
[240:09.43]I think one of us has to get over here.
[240:10.99]Can you make that jump?
[240:17.66]I cannot.
[240:21.14]Okay, but you can't make that jump.
[240:23.55]So you need to swing that back over here somehow.
[240:28.27]Oh.
[240:29.03]Now what do we do?
[240:30.89]You have to jump to the counterweight.
[240:33.45]We can't make this jump from here.
[240:34.51]Can you?
[240:36.21]Yes, you can.
[240:37.17]Apparently you can.
[240:38.11]Okay.
[240:39.63]What do I do now?
[240:41.75]You need to grab onto the wooden pole and swing it back over to us.
[240:45.79]I'll never be able to do that.
[240:46.75]I'm having to look up and hit the button at the same time.
[240:50.35]Does this way go backwards?
[240:52.01]Oh my god, he actually made it across the other side.
[240:54.85]Both trigger and staring up.
[240:57.32]I don't know where we're trying to get to.
[241:00.84]Is this it?
[241:03.96]I have no idea how you do that.
[241:07.00]Um, god.
[241:08.18]Gamers!
[241:18.28]It's just barely not enough.
[241:22.92]I can make it.
[241:26.73]Oh, I can make it.
[241:28.85]Yeah, fuck me.
[241:30.89]Swing around to your right.
[241:33.83]Can you stop saying that?
[241:37.87]Saying what?
[241:38.17]I'm saying swing around?
[241:39.11]Can someone explain to me where I'm supposed to be?
[241:41.07]What am I doing?
[241:41.69]What's the deal?
[241:43.29]Huh?
[241:43.57]Is this it?
[241:44.03]Where do I go?
[241:45.27]Is this forward or backwards?
[241:46.79]Are you talking to yourself?
[241:48.62]Did you tell yourself to stop saying something?
[241:50.10]What the fuck am I doing wrong?
[241:52.16]I don't understand.
[241:53.92]What?
[241:55.62]Why?
[241:56.08]I don't understand what I'm doing wrong.
[241:58.86]How?
[242:00.36]This is fucking possible.
[242:12.77]I jumped too early there.
[242:13.67]Somebody said I jumped too late.
[242:17.30]One guy said I jumped too late.
[242:18.58]Are you being judged by the chat again?
[242:19.98]Are we playing Monster Hunter?
[242:21.80]I'm so angry at this that I can't even do it now.
[242:28.70]You guys have to beat the level without me.
[242:29.80]I'm trying.
[242:41.47]I don't understand!
[242:45.83]Tell me what I'm doing wrong.
[242:48.24]What is happening?
[242:49.68]Why can I not do this?
[242:56.00]I don't know.
[242:59.12]Jesus Christ almighty.
[243:00.58]I'm going to spike this controller into the ground.
[243:03.58]Where am I?
[243:04.82]Where are you?
[243:06.16]Did you go to him?
[243:07.62]I teleported to him.
[243:11.40]That's good news, right?
[243:13.50]Hi.
[243:14.63]I don't, okay, are you supposed to stare up and then run and jump?
[243:17.77]Alright, I think here's what you're doing.
[243:19.21]What was I doing wrong?
[243:21.05]You have to hold X for the whole jump.
[243:22.79]What do you mean hold X for the whole jump?
[243:25.04]Like, here's a tap, watch me.
[243:28.26]Like tap X. Are you serious?
[243:30.32]Versus like hold X is probably like.
[243:32.78]I've never held X, I made it.
[243:34.74]Really?
[243:34.92]Really.
[243:35.89]Well, then you must be jumping too late.
[243:37.95]I don't know.
[243:38.35]Too late?
[243:39.44]Jumping too late.
[243:40.26]Jumping too early.
[243:41.70]Not at the right time.
[243:42.38]I don't know.
[243:42.76]I don't know what to tell you, man.
[243:43.74]Doesn't make any fucking sense.
[243:50.45]How am I doing it wrong?
[244:04.13]Here we go again.
[244:05.13]I can't help myself.
[244:05.97]I'm not doing it right.
[244:08.09]I don't know how.
[244:08.75]I don't know what I'm doing wrong.
[244:11.19]Are we supposed to, like, catch the molten lava ball?
[244:14.21]I don't know, but I fetched a box from over here.
[244:16.63]It was a whole box fiasco.
[244:19.55]I think we're supposed to redirect it.
[244:23.65]So we have to lift these two things?
[244:26.36]Why would we play this on a... Wait, are we being stupid playing this on a controller?
[244:30.54]I think it would be harder on a mouse.
[244:32.08]Keyboard.
[244:34.98]What if I jump on this?
[244:40.88]Donk.
[244:41.14]I think we're supposed to... Oh, you just stay there.
[244:44.16]What if I stay there?
[244:45.88]You just stay right there.
[244:47.74]It's way easier with the mouse and keyboard, apparently.
[244:50.24]Really?
[244:51.30]I don't think so.
[244:54.31]Get free to go.
[244:55.45]Free to go where?
[244:57.15]Like, down?
[244:57.63]Climb back up if you can.
[244:58.81]Oh, you want to climb back up.
[245:03.81]So what do we... Okay, so it launches... You're still climbing the wall.
[245:13.25]Officer problem?
[245:14.05]You've just been... I think it can get rolled down here for some reason, and we can probably ride on top of the ball.
[245:23.66]Ride the boulder?
[245:26.14]I think so, yeah.
[245:28.78]But we have to have the other, uh, the other stick.
[245:35.42]The other stick?
[245:37.12]This, uh, this giant plank of wood.
[245:39.30]Yeah, so just stand on it.
[245:40.24]This'll launch you over here, won't it?
[245:45.02]If you stand on the edge, it's gonna throw you across the whole map.
[245:48.33]Let me just see.
[245:50.51]Get on it now.
[245:52.38]Oh, yeah, dude.
[245:52.94]This is gonna... Watch this.
[246:00.36]Alright.
[246:01.78]Let's see what happens here.
[246:02.88]This is so boring.
[246:04.16]It's hilarious.
[246:05.75]Uh, I mean, it kinda worked.
[246:10.03]There's definitely a way... Maybe I should start running.
[246:16.43]Oh.
[246:17.87]Okay.
[246:18.01]Okay.
[246:20.13]Where are you?
[246:21.13]I'm over here now.
[246:22.13]That didn't really do much.
[246:23.09]I could have jumped over here.
[246:24.65]Are you having fun up there?
[246:29.81]My hands have the layer of sweat right now.
[246:37.08]Don't worry.
[246:37.56]I think I solved the puzzle.
[246:39.76]I'm solving it.
[246:40.60]Don't worry.
[246:41.40]I'm solving it.
[246:42.42]You're just climbing the wall.
[246:45.58]You're not helping anything.
[246:46.80]What the fuck?
[246:50.49]What's down here?
[246:52.33]Can I jump to something from here or is this just fun and look at you're at the end and it's gonna fall?
[246:57.29]I'm in trouble here.
[246:57.93]I'm gonna get hit right in the head.
[247:00.53]Oh my god.
[247:05.27]I love how we're all three trying to do a different section of the puzzle right now.
[247:09.71]I'm just jumping up.
[247:12.79]I'm over here with him.
[247:14.57]Yeah, well, I'm here too, thank you.
[247:15.84]Got anything for that.
[247:16.98]He's off.
[247:17.64]I can't.
[247:18.34]What are you doing?
[247:18.96]No, no, no.
[247:19.84]Hey, go to the other side of this and help me push it across.
[247:21.78]I got it.
[247:33.02]We can just probably leave it there.
[247:34.04]This is so hard.
[247:36.12]Just leave it there.
[247:39.56]I'm not sure if that's going to do anything, though.
[247:41.55]The boxes are definitely mandatory for something.
[247:47.33]They really are.
[247:48.23]Wait, what happens?
[247:49.47]The box is not, that box doesn't even need to be here.
[247:53.93]Am I not supposed to do this or something?
[247:56.69]He says to himself, I got it.
[248:00.51]Just try it.
[248:01.63]Try what?
[248:02.49]The box?
[248:04.74]Now it's hitting that one.
[248:06.50]Yeah, well we wanted to try to hit both at the same time.
[248:09.32]I don't know if it matters, but it's supposed, there's a way to ride the rock down the tube through the other side.
[248:16.73]Somebody said, what am I doing?
[248:18.15]What are you talking about?
[248:25.78]Pull it up.
[248:29.24]See?
[248:29.99]Right.
[248:30.25]And then we gotta ride the boulder.
[248:32.49]So we need the other box under here.
[248:33.99]Okay.
[248:34.69]A little higher.
[248:38.23]Okay, it's under.
[248:40.81]Okay, now follow me.
[248:51.48]Hold your right hand don't let go of your life.
[248:53.80]You know I think I figured it out I honestly think like I'm getting so sweaty that I actually can't do this Like I made this up like five seconds ago like my hands are covered in water Alright now the final test We gotta get on the vault Jesus Christ Genius streamer solves puzzle live
[249:21.70]Is there another one?
[249:23.28]That's it.
[249:24.26]There's been 10.
[249:24.64]That's it.
[249:25.82]We've done like all 30 of the giant boulders.
[249:27.44]All the balls are gone.
[249:28.62]There's no more boulders.
[249:35.55]Okay, here we go.
[249:38.53]Ow.
[249:39.95]Are you under the... I'm currently... I might be the problem here.
[249:43.91]Did you get the achievement?
[249:47.11]Okay, it's going.
[249:48.27]We're supposed to jump off to the other side, I think.
[249:50.49]Wait, were we?
[249:51.11]We were supposed to get off.
[249:53.10]Are you still on it?
[249:53.58]We're not supposed to ride this all the way.
[249:54.72]Yeah, I'm still on it.
[249:56.38]I'm being crushed on your foot right now.
[250:01.14]So we were supposed to get off.
[250:02.32]We were supposed to get off.
[250:03.92]Okay.
[250:05.59]Alright, I'll go from this side.
[250:07.41]You go from the other.
[250:08.43]So where... There's a side on the right.
[250:11.55]You want to get to the right side of the boulder.
[250:13.37]Okay.
[250:15.51]And there's one little pathway.
[250:20.52]Do you see it?
[250:21.04]You can see it from here.
[250:22.30]Do you see like the little grass tunnel?
[250:24.60]I see the grass tunnel, yes.
[250:26.56]That's where we're trying to go.
[250:31.86]Missed the exit.
[250:33.12]So are you grabbing on or are you just going to try and jump and then jump?
[250:35.42]I'm just going to try and jump.
[250:36.70]Yeah.
[250:41.07]Come on, Boulder.
[250:41.57]Let's go.
[250:45.64]Fuck me!
[250:46.38]No, it's not.
[250:48.55]I made it.
[250:49.37]How did you... God damn it, man.
[250:52.37]I made it.
[250:54.45]I can't.
[250:54.99]Hey!
[250:55.49]I can't.
[250:55.73]I'm jumping off the edge.
[250:57.71]Welcome.
[250:58.07]No, you're here.
[250:58.95]Yeah, thank God.
[251:06.20]Sweaty gamers.
[251:07.34]The amount of, like, hand dexterity that I don't have right now.
[251:13.79]Ugh.
[251:17.27]You know what this is really doing?
[251:19.19]We've been doing resistance finger exercises for four and a half hours.
[251:23.25]We're playing 3D QWOP.
[251:24.15]This is how you use stairs.
[251:36.52]What do we do with this?
[251:37.72]I don't know.
[251:44.02]What?
[251:44.16]I've been doing resistance training with my fingers.
[252:00.02]I told you it was gonna happen.
[252:05.20]I just didn't know when.
[252:05.96]I remember at the beginning.
[252:12.99]Do I have to play?
[252:15.71]You made me play!
[252:17.59]You asked for this!
[252:21.17]You're just climbing fucking walls!
[252:23.13]You skipped half the game!
[252:25.80]What?! !
[252:27.80]You said you didn't have the hand dexterity for this.
[252:29.62]You're talking about your hands are sweaty?
[252:31.66]You should be thanking me.
[252:35.74]We like pan across.
[252:38.68]Pan the camera across.
[252:39.82]You're like hanging off of the wall.
[252:44.14]Just cheating.
[252:47.72]No, but I should thank you because my fingers are fucking killing me right now.
[252:54.16]I'm going down through Louie.
[252:56.03]What is this, like, Sesame Street animation we're doing?
[252:59.51]I'm stuck in the K. It's speeding me up.
[253:03.43]Why am I going so fast?
[253:05.73]Oh, hey, welcome.
[253:06.89]Because you've got to see all the credits.
[253:08.21]Grab on, grab on.
[253:10.37]Dude pilot, 9 o'clock.
[253:12.10]I'm trying.
[253:12.70]No, wait for me.
[253:15.88]I want to grab.
[253:16.72]Hit something so I can grab you.
[253:19.50]It's not like we're aiming, really.
[253:20.90]No, no, no.
[253:21.96]Come on, down here.
[253:24.49]I got it.
[253:25.75]Dude pile.
[253:28.63]Okay, spread your wings.
[253:29.37]Spread your wings.
[253:31.45]He's just climbing walls.
[253:34.72]I'll be the middle of the Oreo.
[253:39.80]I was talking about like my wife's cheering me on and my chat was like when I wasn't streaming they were so interested in where I was.
[253:46.24]It's just so funny that two or three of these levels where you were away from the actual puzzles just swing climbing up everything.
[253:55.58]I have to break things.
[253:58.98]Make this man a beta tester.
[254:02.69]No, there was actually at the top of that mountain that I just climbed there were actual Easter eggs.
[254:07.37]So they know.
[254:08.89]Oh.
[254:13.00]Ready with Unity.
[254:14.74]This took 10 years to make.
[254:16.26]15 years to make.
[254:17.50]They started making this game in 2005.
[254:19.84]Wow.
[254:20.20]Wow.
[254:20.84]Oh yeah.
[254:21.18]They invented Unity.
[254:22.90]Watch out.
[254:23.20]Watch out.
[254:23.46]This is the end.
[254:23.92]This is where we die.
[254:24.34]We're going to fall.
[254:24.86]I don't want to fall flat.
[254:26.00]I'm going to beat it.
[254:27.50]I'm going to beat it.
[254:28.04]I don't want to beat it.
[254:28.84]I win.
[254:29.06]I'm beating it.
[254:29.62]I'm beating it.
[254:31.03]I win.
[254:34.31]Put your hands behind your back.
[254:35.89]Put your hands.
[254:36.93]Hey.
[254:38.89]Good work, guys.
[254:39.87]That was fun.
[254:41.31]We've come full circle.
[254:49.80]I just keep thinking of your hands up just climbing up the 90 degree wall dude that last one I I kept getting stuck right at the top it was rough it was really rough oh well I like actually want to go watch a speed run of the game now see how fast they climb the walls I went it's probably not that long speed run for this game but that
[255:15.56]This is like a four to five hour game.
[255:16.96]Well, actually, it's probably like a five hour game.
[255:18.30]This dude's taking a piss, I just noticed.
[255:20.62]Yeah, he's alright.
[255:24.06]Alright.
[255:28.57]The world record is pretty recent.
[255:29.93]Speedrun is like eight minutes.
[255:34.31]Holy shit.
[255:34.91]I see some older ones that are six minutes, but they probably didn't have all the levels.
[255:37.71]But yeah, there's like 748 is what I found.
[255:40.91]Well, that's probably not the newest.
[255:43.24]Think you can beat that?
[255:43.94]I mean, you should try.
[255:46.22]I think my hands would not appreciate it.
[255:51.50]Or maybe at that point you are using keyboard.
[255:53.34]I don't know.
[255:54.62]Yeah, now that I think about this, the controller probably was not a great idea.
[256:00.54]Can we watch together?
[256:01.34]I think that's the best idea.
[256:02.54]I sure wants to watch.
[256:03.64]Your left trigger and right trigger, that's left click and right click.
[256:08.61]That's much easier to do than holding down the triggers with two hands.
[256:12.77]Well, the general just moving, since it's like you're moving while drunk the whole game, you would rather have a thumbstick to offset the deviation than WASD.
[256:25.16]That's true.
[256:26.88]Alright, I'm going.
[256:27.70]Alright, well, thanks for playing Star.
[256:30.52]See you again.
[256:30.90]Have a great night.
[256:31.82]You too.
[256:32.42]Thanks for bailing us out.
[256:34.52]And remember, fake hair everywhere.
[256:37.96]That's true.
[256:38.62]And is he gone?
[256:39.42]He's gone.
[256:40.02]That's how he left it.
[256:41.00]And he's gone.
[256:45.26]And it's Alec.
[256:45.74]Thanks for playing it, Alec.
[256:47.10]Hey, thanks for playing, if you can call it that.
[256:50.38]And hey, thank you, the viewer.
[256:53.55]Viewers like you.
[256:56.63]That was fun.
[256:58.49]No, it wasn't.
[256:59.17]I got a little, I'm not going to lie, I did get a little tired and irritable at the end there.
[257:04.16]But that's just, you know, that's how it is.
[257:06.28]Four hours in this game is like 12 hours in the outside world.
[257:14.04]Four hours in this game is 20 hours in the real world.
[257:18.53]Alright, well, thanks for playing, dude.
[257:20.01]See you again soon.
[257:21.87]Yeah, see you again real soon.
[257:26.83]And thanks, everybody, for watching.
[257:31.30]So, uh, nothing tomorrow.
[257:34.30]The next time you will see me, we'll be back Friday.
[257:37.80]Friday night, we're gonna do Labo.
[257:40.84]Going back to the Labo.
[257:43.88]Human Fall Flat, pretty fun game.
[257:45.67]Although fairly short.
[257:48.05]It's, uh, I mean, without the cheating.
[257:51.21]Probably add another hour or so to the game.
[257:54.13]So, it's like a five hour experience.
[257:59.25]The emote results are gonna be on Saturday.
[258:01.11]We're gonna do a whole thing.
[258:03.47]It's not just who won the contest, there's gonna be an extra little added surprise on that stream.
[258:09.90]So, we'll do a little thing on Saturday.
[258:12.60]So, again, Friday and Saturday are the next streams, nothing tomorrow.
[258:17.38]Thanks for hanging out, and also thank you to Star and Etalyx for playing as well.
[258:22.95]So, why do you say we do the credits?
[258:29.01]Am I going to play this game again?
[258:30.79]Probably not.
[258:32.89]We did get to the end.
[258:44.75]Roll the credits, as they say.
[258:49.45]The Labo should be fun.
[258:51.23]We've got quite a bit to do on Friday.
[259:01.31]What the fuck?
[259:02.03]What?
[259:02.17]And that computer's turning off!
[259:03.65]No!
[259:03.97]No!
[259:06.95]That was so dumb.
[259:13.88]What a fucking stupid feature.
[259:17.22]Holy shit, man.
[259:21.18]Steam Big Picture Mode.
[259:23.36]If you exit out of Steam Big Picture by actually hitting, like, the exit button, it turns off the whole computer.
[259:34.07]Jesus Christ.
[259:36.81]But I can get the subs back.
[259:39.81]I see it here.
[259:40.31]It's just the bits cut off at three hours ago.
[259:46.37]So... 280 viewers.
[259:54.88]I will say thank you to the subs.
[259:58.84]Which, here they are.
[260:02.46]So dumb.
[260:03.96]I pressed it, and it's like, oh, okay, yeah, get out of here.
[260:06.60]Turn off.
[260:07.04]I just pressed it and hit, like, enter.
[260:08.31]I didn't know.
[260:08.77]And it's, like, shutting down, like, the windows.
[260:11.89]And I had to hit, thank God Steam was open so I could hit cancel.
[260:14.73]And you could hear me screaming.
[260:15.77]I don't know.
[260:16.31]I said a few things.
[260:18.33]I don't know if you guys could even hear it.
[260:21.27]Alright.
[260:21.57]So we can do the subscriptions.
[260:24.90]So we have, what's today?
[260:29.02]Today is the 1st.
[260:34.37]So we have subscribers from the first.
[260:36.81]I can see these.
[260:39.94]So why don't we read them?
[260:41.74]Here are the subs from today.
[260:44.90]Is this even keeping track at all?
[260:46.18]We'll find out.
[260:48.12]Rusty Shackle, thank you.
[260:50.74]Naffen, Jake Bell, Super Seal, SJH078, AKO Sean Michael, Roy Bindleton, Banana Bread33, Maridical,
[261:03.34]Thank you guys.
[261:03.94]That's the only ones that are listed here.
[261:06.82]There's probably more.
[261:28.50]But for some reason, it's... That's all I can see.
[261:32.02]This is not an exact list of your current subscribers.
[261:38.30]Jeremy, did the stream end?
[261:40.23]Yeah, because I hit escape and then went to... I closed out of big picture mode and it turned off my computer.
[261:45.85]Or it tried to.
[261:46.43]I caught it right at the end.
[261:47.37]But it exited all my fucking programs.
[261:50.35]I only opened big picture mode to do the controller setting thing.
[261:53.52]And I left it on.
[261:55.88]Anyways...
[261:57.92]You didn't get a notification till right now.
[262:00.10]Oh shit, man.
[262:00.86]That was a four and a half hour stream.
[262:03.46]We have bits till three hours ago.
[262:04.98]I'm going to go through them.
[262:07.88]Thank you so much to Captain Morgan for the $1.50.
[262:10.86]Had my wisdom teeth removed yesterday.
[262:13.31]The stream is making me laugh too much.
[262:14.83]Laughs are pain.
[262:17.41]That sucks.
[262:18.03]I turned into like a hamster when I had my wisdom teeth taken out.
[262:21.23]It sucked.
[262:22.75]Your face blows up.
[262:23.75]You have big chunky cheeks.
[262:26.46]Next stream is going to be Friday.
[262:27.38]I'm going to go back to the Labo.
[262:30.99]But thank you, Captain Walker.
[262:31.91]Thank you, Toaster Oven.
[262:33.17]Thank you, Brandance.
[262:37.17]For the $1, Brandance.
[262:39.19]I don't really know what to write here, but I wanted to say thanks for the great streams and laughs.
[262:42.38]All that jazz.
[262:43.40]The past few months have been pretty hard on me, and your streams helped me to kind of feel myself again.
[262:49.12]Keep it up.
[262:49.52]Hopefully that doesn't sound too cliche.
[262:51.13]I don't really know what to put.
[262:53.99]Thank you, Brandunce.
[262:55.63]Brandunce, thank you so much for the $1.
[262:59.90]I'm happy that you enjoy the streams.
[263:02.56]Happy that you're having fun.
[263:04.42]That makes me very happy.
[263:06.94]Casey, thanks for the $1.
[263:08.10]I always knew you were a quitter.
[263:10.50]No, sometimes you get a pulled plug.
[263:14.05]The Reaper of Memes, thanks for the $1.
[263:15.47]Jerma vs. Star.
[263:16.69]Jerma vs. Star.
[263:17.37]Everyone wants to see this happen.
[263:19.11]Don't forget to throw that 2004 Spongebob game into the back catalog of PlayStation 2 games.
[263:24.13]I'll give 100 bits every stream until you do.
[263:26.37]Jesus.
[263:29.77]That's not going to be for a while.
[263:31.65]Just a fair warning.
[263:38.13]Sly161, thanks for the $1.
[263:39.81]Abandoning Etalyx the stream.
[263:42.91]Well, it turned into Stargo cheats and climbs walls.
[263:50.39]So there was an abandonment all across the board there.
[263:54.12]Do I have a Discord server?
[263:55.05]Yes, I do.
[263:55.87]It's public.
[263:56.33]It's open to the public.
[263:58.69]We'll get somebody to just put it in there.
[264:00.41]There it is.
[264:01.73]StixRenegade, thanks for the $1.
[264:03.07]Here's a hint to what you forgot.
[264:04.69]You have to watch something you said you'd watch and you have to draw something you said you'd draw.
[264:08.84]Oh, a picture of you.
[264:10.90]And a rat movie.
[264:13.28]Now I remember.
[264:13.80]All it took was human fall flat.
[264:18.10]I remember.
[264:20.62]Thank you to GrageSucks.
[264:25.07]Grage sucks, thanks for the $1.
[264:26.69]Holeof1zombie, thanks for the $1.
[264:28.25]Stursdude reminds me of Flat Eric.
[264:32.13]I don't know who Flat Eric is, but thank you, Holeof1zombie.
[264:34.27]Thanks for the dollar again.
[264:35.05]You always have to think about the bigger picture and what a trash it is.
[264:39.45]Trash it is.
[264:42.00]Also, keep in mind, I just want to make sure I haven't talked about this in a while, but to have the bits read, it's a 100-bit minimum to read the bits.
[264:53.41]Probably, I haven't said that in a long time.
[264:54.75]I mean, I think there's some people that haven't heard it.
[264:56.83]Just wanna make sure they know.
[265:00.19]No, 100 bits of $1.
[265:02.58]Not a thousand.
[265:05.32]But thank you.
[265:06.48]Thank you, Devlon.
[265:07.54]Two million for the $1.
[265:08.60]Hey, Jerbo, I'm off to college in two weeks and I just started talking with my roommate over Facebook.
[265:13.84]What would you recommend doing, saying to make him like me in less than 10 seconds?
[265:17.51]Big hearts to you.
[265:18.67]Funny, unlucky man.
[265:21.48]Uh, well, if I were you, I would just, I would cover, before he gets there, I would cover the whole room in Vaseline.
[265:28.20]The entire one.
[265:29.74]And just, while he's coming in, be mumbling to yourself in the chair, like, it's an antimicrobial.
[265:34.56]No, it's an antimicrobial.
[265:35.78]I can't have it.
[265:36.86]It's all antimicrobial.
[265:39.22]Everything has to be antimicrobial.
[265:40.71]And see what he does.
[265:50.04]Okay, I can't... Holy shit.
[265:54.77]I can't read that.
[266:00.85]Oh my God.
[266:01.65]Like, whatever.
[266:04.62]Oh, thank you.
[266:07.18]Don't do any of that.
[266:08.06]Greet him with a handshake.
[266:08.94]Make sure it's nice and firm and say, what up, man?
[266:11.04]College!
[266:11.92]Are you ready?
[266:12.68]I'm ready.
[266:13.84]What classes do you take?
[266:14.98]Dude, are we in the same class?
[266:20.71]He'll get a kick out of it.
[266:22.71]But thank you, dude.
[266:23.81]Congratulations on getting into college and... Good luck.
[266:29.22]I'm not going to read that.
[266:29.92]Mostly lost.
[266:30.42]Thanks for the... Thank you, Mo... Thank you... No, I'm not reading that either.
[266:34.08]Thank you.
[266:34.90]Thank you.
[266:35.54]Thank you again.
[266:37.36]I can't believe you read a 99-bit message.
[266:39.34]I did not, Coconut.
[266:40.46]I did not.
[266:41.45]Thank you for the $1.
[266:43.69]Hey, SirFeline.
[266:44.37]Thank you for the $1.
[266:45.51]Good thing I missed this stream.
[266:46.87]Feels bad, man.
[266:49.23]It wasn't that long.
[266:49.77]It was like four and a half hours.
[266:52.37]It was a fun stream.
[266:53.39]That was a very fun.
[266:54.05]I had a great time.
[266:55.73]It's good to get the three boys back.
[266:56.93]You know what I mean?
[266:59.64]And then XX.
[267:00.66]It's Rudy.
[267:01.22]Thanks for the $1.
[267:01.78]Are you ever going to play that dead game?
[267:04.32]Team Defense Fort 2.
[267:07.52]I have no idea.
[267:09.44]Maybe.
[267:10.38]Probably not.
[267:11.10]But maybe.
[267:12.47]I can't tell you that for certain.
[267:15.93]I have no idea.
[267:18.02]Not against it, but not necessarily for it at any time soon.
[267:22.56]I have streamed it before.
[267:25.20]But thank you KXZ501 for the 10 bucks.
[267:28.44]Thank you, dude.
[267:29.00]Thanks again for the amazing stream, Jerma.
[267:30.32]My sides were in orbit the whole stream.
[267:33.91]I'm glad that you liked it.
[267:35.01]It was very fun.
[267:38.41]Jerma, I've lurked here for a while and I just want to say that you have a large dumb.
[267:43.61]Hey.
[267:46.25]What?
[267:47.80]Thank you.
[267:48.10]Mostly lost for the $1.
[267:49.00]Here's an actual bit message you can read about Deon with V. Sure.
[267:55.18]Thank you, Sir Phelan, for the $1.
[267:56.62]Anti-microbial.
[267:57.46]Mm-hmm.
[267:59.22]Manboy, thanks for the $1.
[268:01.30]There goes my bits, I guess.
[268:02.54]If you don't mind, could you watch the video that I showed on the Labo stream?
[268:07.56]Be sure to turn up the volume.
[268:10.74]Let's see.
[268:14.74]Okay, let's...
[268:17.41]Is this on, like, YouTube, or... Is this on YouTube, or how does this work?
[268:24.57]Is this embedded into Reddit?
[268:32.00]Uh, okay, so here's... I'm gonna watch this on stream.
[268:36.42]Because I can't... How do you, like, get, like, pull a actual... I'm not a Reddit user.
[268:45.92]Well, okay.
[268:46.58]Well, here's the link.
[268:48.56]Let's watch this.
[268:51.20]Turn your volume down.
[268:54.06]Because I'm about to play it on stream.
[268:56.00]Or at least the audio.
[268:58.66]You can't do direct links.
[269:02.62]Wait, there's a YouTube link in the comments?
[269:17.99]Okay, here we go, here we go.
[269:19.03]I can put this on stream.
[269:22.87]That's fucking funny.
[269:24.12]Hold on, let me get this on stream.
[269:39.15]And if you want to hear what I'm talking about here, I'm talking about a real statement.
[269:52.70]Is this just like every fuck up?
[270:02.32]I gotta go.
[270:16.41]I gotta go.
[270:16.89]I'm not kidding.
[270:17.63]I gotta go.
[270:20.84]Oh, no, this is bad fucking news.
[270:22.78]No!
[270:23.18]I gotta go.
[270:23.96]I'm so sorry, guys.
[270:25.30]I gotta go.
[270:26.22]Vlog.
[270:26.42]Get the fuck out of here, Santa!
[270:53.26]Oh, this is great.
[271:00.96]I just did that to you!
[271:05.26]I'm so sorry.
[271:06.70]Guys, I am sorry.
[271:12.90]I'm fucking so sorry.
[271:14.06]Jesus Christ!
[271:14.80]Oh yeah, when she like came in.
[271:16.81]No!
[271:17.61]That sucked.
[271:18.01]What are you thinking?
[271:18.77]What are you thinking?
[271:28.72]what the fuck is it doing what are you doing oh that was great that was great
[271:59.84]Look at how much fun we've had.
[272:03.50]But thank you for that, man.
[272:05.08]That was fucking funny.
[272:07.76]It's a hard knock stream.
[272:12.55]Thank you so much, Manboy.
[272:17.85]Let's hear the claps.
[272:18.95]Let's hear the claps.
[272:23.11]Thank you, Manboy, for that again.
[272:24.79]Tyler, Mike, thanks for the $1.
[272:26.05]Hey, Jerma, I donated $10 earlier and got scammed.
[272:29.51]I'm sorry.
[272:30.15]I'm so sorry.
[272:31.00]I fucking hate when that happens.
[272:32.14]I really do.
[272:33.82]That sucks so much.
[272:37.04]It just... I can't go find those bits anywhere.
[272:40.10]I guess I could, like... No, it doesn't, like, keep track.
[272:43.58]Like, I don't think even Twitch keeps track of those.
[272:50.00]For some reason, it just gets cut off.
[272:52.52]And not on the eighth... Hold on.
[272:54.59]Let me just, like, triple check this.
[272:57.50]There has to be a way where I can pull this out, right?
[273:01.22]I have like donation settings, dashboard, but the dashboard only goes so far.
[273:06.20]I can't go back any further.
[273:07.79]I don't know why it does this.
[273:15.73]Integration.
[273:16.55]No.
[273:20.57]I can see the subscribers, or at least some of them.
[273:27.75]Don't donate bits to the scam artist.
[273:31.79]I can't fucking, why did it have to turn me off?
[273:36.52]But regardless, I'm sorry that that happens and I haven't figured out like a real solution to that when it does happen.
[273:42.75]I appreciate any money that you guys give, for real.
[273:46.23]But anyways, Tyler, thank you for the $11.
[273:47.63]I basically just said I've been watching you for five to six years and you have helped me through so much in life.
[273:53.11]Do you think you could end this stream with this song for nostalgia's sake?
[274:01.88]Yeah, sure, let's just keep it on.
[274:04.46]This is an old one.
[274:07.44]Hey, thanks a lot, Tyler Mike.
[274:10.80]I'll keep it low.
[274:13.45]So, thank you, Tyler.
[274:15.49]Thank you, XX.
[274:16.49]It's Rudy.
[274:17.05]Thanks for the $1.45.
[274:19.15]Jerma, don't put cigarettes out on your dick.
[274:22.75]Remember.
[274:23.97]Don't worry.
[274:24.35]I won't.
[274:26.02]I will not.
[274:28.08]Sir Feline, thank you for the $1.
[274:30.54]Pretty funny Star Wars edit.
[274:31.78]Oh, wait.
[274:34.14]Star Wars edit.
[274:38.82]R2-D2's message.
[274:46.03]Why are we watching a Star Wars video?
[274:51.65]I don't even... Why would you show me this?
[274:53.60]I don't... It's a... I don't want to see this.
[274:56.92]I just got, like, Rickrolled in the video.
[274:59.06]He got Rickrolled in the video.
[275:00.62]And by connection, I did.
[275:02.78]Okay.
[275:08.15]Thank you, Sir Feline.
[275:08.99]Thank you, Boba.
[275:10.53]Boba8710 for the 10 bucks.
[275:11.91]Hey, Jerma.
[275:13.33]Been a fan for a long time.
[275:14.19]Just want to say I appreciate everything you do.
[275:15.95]Started watching your stuff back in the GTA 4 days and was instantly hooked.
[275:19.21]10 out of 10.
[275:20.17]Funny dude.
[275:21.89]Thanks for everything.
[275:24.43]Thank you, Boba.
[275:28.31]Appreciate the love and support and the money here.
[275:31.62]That's... Thank you.
[275:34.04]That's all I can say.
[275:35.26]I'm glad you enjoy it.
[275:37.88]Thank you to Chubby Funster for the seven bucks.
[275:44.06]Hey Jerma, Sprio has tried to show you this, but you keep missing it, so here's hoping you see it this time.
[275:49.07]Coming in the ring, the infamous wrestler who against all odds defeated the legendary champion Glue Man at a height of four foot six, 13 kilograms.
[275:56.32]Here comes Gull Man.
[276:11.05]That's me.
[276:13.33]I thought this was an actual character that was made in the wrestling game.
[276:18.97]Is it?
[276:20.35]No, it's not.
[276:24.43]That looks pretty authentic.
[276:29.43]But thank you, Chubby Funster.
[276:30.51]And thank you, Spreo.
[276:32.82]Also, Kyra told me thanks for the $1.
[276:34.24]Write down every Bit donation by hand and put it on the fridge so you never lose them.
[276:39.25]Hey SuperSeal, thanks for the $1.
[276:40.69]Is this the funniest streamer that reacts to YouTube videos?
[276:43.13]I have a YouTube video.
[277:07.09]I hate that.
[277:08.69]I didn't... I didn't like any of that.
[277:21.68]You're not supposed to like it.
[277:22.92]Well now you're just gonna make it... I'm not gonna wanna click on your links anymore!
[277:33.62]Anyways, that is it.
[277:35.90]If you gave bits earlier, more than three hours ago, at the very beginning of the stream, I'm very sorry that it gets cut off.
[277:43.21]And if I missed the subs as well, I'm sorry.
[277:47.99]Hopefully I didn't miss them, because I do have access to that, and that might not be a full list.
[277:54.58]So, thank you guys.
[277:58.84]The boy who cried Rickroll.
[278:01.48]Hey, Chubby Funster, thanks for the $1.
[278:02.98]Great stream, by the way, cutie.
[278:05.00]Thank you.
[278:06.86]And EternalWall, thanks for the $1.
[278:08.22]Hey, Jeremy, I want to... Whoa, hold on.
[278:09.50]We got a couple coming in here.
[278:10.46]EternalWall, thanks for the $1.
[278:12.26]Jeremy, I just want to thank you for all the laughs you've given me over the past few years.
[278:15.35]You've helped me through some rough patches in life.
[278:17.71]And honestly, I don't know how I would pull through if I didn't have my daily dose of Jeremy.
[278:23.69]Well, we're not live every day.
[278:25.13]We're live like three times a week.
[278:27.89]But... Thank you.
[278:31.45]Thanks a lot.
[278:32.03]I'm glad you enjoy it.
[278:35.09]Thank you, Eternal Will, for your incredibly kind words.
[278:39.05]And XXRudyXX, here's another YouTube link that says just watch.
[278:45.30]I don't want to do that.
[278:47.12]I don't want to click links after being Rickrolled.
[278:52.50]Should I click links after being Rickrolled?
[278:54.58]Let's find out.
[278:55.60]I'm going to be playing Team Fortress 2 as... The Pirate Spy!
[279:03.32]Alright, thank you, X Rudy.
[279:05.44]Thank you, Clueless Sniper, for the $1.
[279:06.80]Hey, streamer, please click on my funny link.
[279:10.22]It's my iPhone 6.
[279:11.50]You can turn off the performance management feature.
[279:15.15]It's an ad.

[290:10.72]I just think, you know, this is earned.
[290:13.24]It's kind of a sacred thing that people earn.
[290:15.46]And I don't want to, like, step on that.
[290:18.24]Because, you know, I don't want to make a joke out of it.
[290:20.26]Let's put it that way.
[290:21.88]As much as you're saying it's not and we're just having fun, I don't want to make it like a jokey thing.
[290:27.57]Does that make sense?
[290:28.13]I hope it does.
[290:31.61]There you go.

[292:33.16]Oh, by the way, this is Blordell.
[292:34.58]Please continue to support Blordell.
[292:37.49]This is not my song.
[292:38.41]This is his song.
[292:39.48]He wrote it.
[292:40.02]He made it.
[292:42.04]But thanks, guys.
[292:42.76]Take care.
