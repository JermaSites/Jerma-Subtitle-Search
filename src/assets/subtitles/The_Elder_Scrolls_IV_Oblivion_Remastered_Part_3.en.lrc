[ve:61.1.100]

[00:44.53]hello how are you and hold on let's just get this out of the way did he fix the audio you tell me good to go
[01:15.24]Why do you sound like a Guinea pig?
[01:22.86]Alright.
[01:23.44]Fucking ban that guy.
[01:26.06]Alright.
[01:26.36]Ads might start here in about 10 seconds.
[01:27.93]Get them out of the way.
[01:28.59]Let's get the pre-roll out of the way.
[01:32.53]If they start, if they don't, then, you know, I'll be back in a couple of minutes.
[01:36.52]I got to get my coffee.
[01:37.52]I've got to be ready.
[01:39.41]See if they start.
[01:42.75]if they don't you know it's all good we can chill for a few minutes I feel I feel pretty good I feel alright you're gonna play the new Deltarune chapters when they come out I don't know I don't know if I'm gonna stream it I am gonna have to re uh refresh that whole game for my brain
[02:09.43]I might play a lot of it off stream.
[02:12.23]I might just do it off stream.
[02:13.39]I might want to just enjoy that off stream.
[02:19.92]At the very minimum, I'm going to have to do a full on refresh.
[02:25.23]But I don't know.
[02:26.73]That's awesome that it's coming out.
[02:29.67]Is the whole thing going to be completed?
[02:32.37]Or is that I know it's what one or two chapters?
[02:40.56]No, not yet.
[02:43.89]Yes, two chapters.
[02:44.61]Four out of seven chapters.
[02:48.51]Three more chapters.
[02:50.83]Oh, shit.
[02:58.02]What is your GPU?
[02:58.88]I couldn't run Oblivion on a 5060.
[03:00.66]I have a 3090.
[03:04.31]I have a 3090.
[03:11.92]I don't know.
[03:12.36]Yeah, go ahead.
[03:13.27]You can do the omega lulz.
[03:21.30]Yeah, and keep in mind, I bought this during the fucking... I needed a new graphics card.
[03:28.61]I needed a really good one two, three, four years ago, whatever it was.
[03:32.27]And I was part of the people that had to pay like 100% premium on it.
[03:37.24]Do you remember that?
[03:37.98]Back in the COVID price 3090s, 3080s?
[03:40.90]I remember I was just like, fucking God, man.
[03:43.23]Okay, well, I think it was a lot.
[03:46.41]And I was very upset about it.
[03:50.21]The COVID GPU pricing was something to remember, for sure.
[03:56.45]3060 Ti was like that too, yeah.
[04:05.36]You should sign it and sell it for 5k.
[04:10.35]No, I'm using it.
[04:11.57]I need it.
[04:13.61]I'm not, I don't care.
[04:14.37]I don't upgrade until I need to.
[04:16.97]I don't want any of the new stuff.
[04:18.61]This thing works just fine.
[04:21.26]I don't have any problems with this really.
[04:22.82]The bottleneck that I have is my CPU.
[04:24.34]My CPU is the problem.
[04:26.65]I don't know what it is.
[04:27.39]My CPU is running not great recently.
[04:29.71]It lasts like six months.
[04:33.92]Especially while streaming.
[04:37.59]I might even do a streaming PC, but that's like kind of...
[04:41.81]And I'm just, I'm just, especially in this period where I'm just streaming whatever and whatever.
[04:47.16]I don't know if I'm going to be like a streaming PC into a compressor, into a hardware limiter, into a, into a fucking, you know?
[04:54.31]I don't think that's going to happen.
[05:00.96]Did you bend the pins because you thought it was funny?
[05:05.53]That is a blasphemous thing to say to a computer PC computer enthusiast.
[05:16.39]You're ignorant.
[05:17.05]Get with the times.
[05:18.97]I think a 3090 is plenty with the times.
[05:25.68]I think it's quite more than it with the times.
[05:30.94]That is an incredibly powerful piece of hardware.
[05:36.97]Like, you want me to get the Lamborghini S instead of having the Lamborghini.
[05:41.10]I don't think that's necessary.
[05:49.29]You need to treat yourself.
[05:50.54]That is, a 3090 is a treat.
[05:53.28]That is a treat.
[05:53.97]That is way, that is not a treat.
[05:55.31]That is the whole ice cream store.
[05:57.58]3090 is the entire ice cream store.
[05:59.66]It's not just like a soft serve cone.
[06:09.90]Eight ads, Jerma, what the fuck?
[06:12.72]Oh, here, the ad started.
[06:13.84]I'm glad we could hear about it.
[06:18.17]I'm sorry.
[06:19.31]Alright, I'll be right back.
[06:21.00]See?
[06:22.04]It looks like they started.
[06:23.62]I'll be back in a few minutes.
[07:14.21]Somebody said one inch penis.
[07:15.61]Ban that person for inaccurate information.
[07:17.64]That's misinformation.
[07:21.05]Oh, that's... I'm not supposed to be back yet.
[07:24.00]Be right back.
[07:54.29]Alright, I'm back.
[07:55.37]I got everything I need.
[07:56.05]I got my coffee.
[07:58.39]I got... You gonna play Night Rain?
[08:06.74]I am not gonna play Night Rain on launch.
[08:09.09]I'm gonna miss the launch by a couple days.
[08:12.77]I will be 100% playing it though.
[08:16.54]You can guarantee that I'll at least be playing it on stream a little bit.
[08:19.66]But I will miss the launch.
[08:24.73]Try different breakfasts from around the world and rate them.
[08:27.51]Putting them on the accent of the place the food is from.
[08:32.36]Wait, no, no.
[08:32.72]You should try different breakfasts from around the world and rate them while putting on the accent of the place the food is from.
[08:37.84]Uh, I feel like that's a really bad idea.
[08:44.09]I don't think that's gonna fly.
[08:46.27]I don't think that's a good idea.
[08:49.60]That's not smart.
[08:59.04]Guess the food based on an accent.
[09:07.27]I wouldn't be able to do that.
[09:21.38]Alright, you guys ready?
[09:22.68]The last thing we did was this.
[09:26.17]Here we go.
[09:28.97]We were... Okay, I gotta go back here.
[09:35.56]We gotta bring Martin back to Wayne and Priory.
[09:40.87]Immediately.
[09:44.94]We just closed the Oblivion Gate.
[09:51.13]And it was incredibly intense.
[09:53.79]I... I had an asthma attack during it because it was fucking crazy.
[10:00.70]And that's not because I swallowed a bug on stream like people are fucking accusing me of.
[10:04.42]That's because it was intense.
[10:08.17]Alright, here we go.
[10:13.27]I don't... I can't... Wait, why not?
[10:18.60]Alright, make sure everything's good.
[10:19.92]Oh, I can't travel from inside this house?
[10:26.43]How's the audio?
[10:27.51]Is that too loud or is it good?
[10:38.53]good okay alright I can travel from here though right here's my free horse that I stole previously alright can he get on the horse with me no
[11:09.18]How do I bring the horse with me?
[11:10.54]Can I fast travel with the horse?
[11:16.60]Hey dude, are you going to install any nudity mods?
[11:19.15]I already have one active.
[11:21.67]I have the horse and animal nudity mod.
[11:24.19]Specifically the horse one.
[11:26.92]As you can see.
[11:31.72]So there is one already on.
[11:33.87]Wait, he's got a horse too.
[11:45.19]There are no mods.
[11:46.25]No, none.
[11:47.41]Okay, let's ride.
[11:50.29]Let's ride.
[11:50.87]I want to ride there.
[11:53.05]So we gotta go this way.
[11:54.52]Up here.
[11:59.96]How fast of a gallop can we have?
[12:03.96]What about this priest guy?
[12:05.15]He doesn't have a horse.
[12:05.71]That's kind of unfair.
[12:11.75]Does he just run?
[12:18.68]He does.
[12:19.51]Alright, well, I just want to ride for a minute because we're not going to be able to fast travel with a horse.
[12:22.17]I guarantee it.
[12:24.58]Speaking from complete ignorance.
[12:34.40]Yeah.
[12:36.31]Yeah.
[12:55.32]Where are they?
[13:01.01]Why are they not following me?
[13:06.58]The guy actually is just running.
[13:09.32]One of us can definitely put him on the back, right?
[13:15.13]Alright, fuck this.
[13:16.05]I'm not doing that.
[13:17.17]Look, I'm not even close.
[13:18.03]Alright, we're going to go.
[13:20.06]We're going to go to the Cloud Ruler Temple.
[13:25.58]Normally Martin gets on another horse.
[13:27.04]You stole that horse earlier.
[13:29.32]Oh.
[13:32.03]OK, well, here we are.
[13:32.81]We're good.
[13:39.28]Park the horses right here.
[13:44.86]I've put myself in your hands.
[13:48.03]Yes.
[13:49.75]OK, oh.
[13:53.02]Just in case they're fucking hostile.
[13:55.45]grandmaster is this yes cyrus this is the emperor's son Martin septim good evening sir my lord well don't get so close ruler temple we have not had the honor of an emperor's visit in many years ah well thank you the honor is mine come your blades are waiting to greet you okay seems friendly
[14:32.06]I just want one of them to turn to me and just do a GTA pedestrian line.
[14:36.85]My back is killing me.
[14:44.42]That's me.
[15:01.78]Okay, let's die.
[15:04.72]Let's start attacking.
[15:06.71]Let's start attacking.
[15:07.67]The blades are at your command.
[15:09.45]You will be safe here until you can take up your throne.
[15:12.90]I thought they were going to fucking attack me.
[15:14.28]All of you.
[15:15.70]I know you all expect me to be emperor.
[15:18.26]I'll do my best.
[15:20.37]But this is all new to me.
[15:23.23]I'm not used to giving speeches, but I wanted you to know that I appreciate your welcome here.
[15:30.84]I hope I prove myself worthy of your loyalty in the coming days.
[15:36.05]That's it.
[15:37.83]Thank you.
[15:38.87]Short and sweet.
[15:39.47]I like it.
[15:40.51]Thank you, Martin.
[15:41.07]He's a true leader.
[15:42.39]We'd all best get back to our duties, eh, Captain?
[15:45.72]Not much of a speech, was it?
[15:47.42]Didn't seem to bother them, though.
[15:48.46]No, it was perfect.
[15:49.24]That was exactly how it should have been.
[15:52.28]I don't mean to sound ungrateful.
[15:54.74]I know I would be dead by now if it weren't for you.
[15:57.67]Okay.
[16:00.31]Just do what every other emperor did in history.
[16:11.83]Just lay around, eat grapes, and yell at people.
[16:16.42]Like, there's a pretty low bar for what you will be doing.
[16:21.25]You could do anything, and anything positive will be good.
[16:25.55]Of course, the Amulet of Kings.
[16:29.09]So we, I, can take it to the Temple of the One and light the dragon fires.
[16:35.88]And stop the Oblivion invasion.
[16:42.79]And you will be the Emperor.
[16:44.11]The Emperor?
[16:46.30]That's an idea that will take some getting used to.
[16:48.86]In any case, we need the Amulet first.
[16:51.74]Maybe Joffrey will know where to start.
[16:56.16]where is it all practitioners of daedric magic are familiar with the almost impenetrable barrier between our world and oblivion what the emperor told you implies that the amulet is the key to the preservation of that barrier what I saw at kvarch everything I know about daedric magic says that such stable portals are impossible yet those gates to oblivion existed
[17:21.15]The old rules no longer apply.
[17:23.76]Kvatch is only the beginning of what Mehrunes Dagon will do.
[17:28.78]If the amulet is truly the key to restoring the barriers between our world and Oblivion, you must waste no time in recovering it.
[17:37.49]Just a quick observation.
[17:40.78]The fire is moving back here.
[17:42.94]So we're in real time.
[17:44.36]He's moving around.
[17:45.25]This fire is moving around.
[17:46.35]The snow is moving around.
[17:47.59]What's this guy doing?
[17:49.75]Why is he frozen?
[17:50.66]Why is he not moving?
[17:51.82]Why is he pretending to be... He's like doing the theater thing.
[17:56.51]I don't understand that.
[17:57.19]Why is the fire not... The fire should be frozen.
[18:02.42]You don't have the right rank to speak to me.
[18:13.60]Alright, where is it?
[18:15.98]Nope.
[18:17.64]Uh, no.
[18:19.79]Nah.
[18:20.25]I'm already in the mage.
[18:24.73]I'm in the mage guild.
[18:36.33]Nah.
[18:38.19]Very well.
[18:39.45]Many serve the Empire in their own way.
[18:42.03]But we would be honored to have you if you change your mind.
[18:47.92]Alright.
[18:48.36]So, where is it?
[18:49.44]You're right.
[18:50.70]We must try to recover the amulet before the enemy takes it out of our reach.
[18:54.60]You should go back to the Imperial City.
[18:56.99]Boris may have learned something about the Assassins.
[18:59.57]Curiously.
[18:59.81]You'll find Boris at Luther Broad's boarding house in the Elven Gardens district of the Imperial City.
[19:06.12]Okay.
[19:07.89]Alright.
[19:10.07]Get that give my warm regards to Boris.
[19:13.51]Tell him he should not blame himself for the Emperor's death.
[19:16.64]He did well to send you to me.
[19:19.90]Where's my horse?
[19:21.12]Alright, so we gotta go this way.
[19:22.30]I'm gonna.
[19:22.96]I'm not gonna fast travel.
[19:23.94]I want to.
[19:25.47]This is not mine and I just stole this, I guess.
[19:28.15]Where's my horse?
[19:32.49]There it is.
[19:34.60]Let's not fast travel.
[19:35.44]I want to go.
[19:35.84]I want to explore a little.
[19:39.39]Because we've got to go this way.
[19:43.54]Alright, we've got to go to the city.
[19:44.78]So on the road... I'm going to go down this road and just... I'm going to explore.
[19:47.40]I want to see what's out here.
[19:50.75]Right here.
[19:51.03]We're going to go down this road.
[19:52.59]And I'm going to just explore.
[19:54.96]I'm not just going to do the main quest.
[19:56.66]I'll be done with the game in 15 minutes, if that's the case.
[19:59.78]I've seen the speedrun.
[20:01.23]I know you can beat this game in 8 minutes.
[20:03.01]I'm not going to do that.
[20:15.93]You can.
[20:16.33]Yes, you can.
[20:17.83]If you immediately, before the thunder strikes the cathedral, which happens at, I believe, 15 minutes into the first cutscene.
[20:27.42]If you can, you get out of the cutscene and you have to steal a horse and you get there quick.
[20:31.91]Before the lightning hits, you move the guy in front of the front door of the church.
[20:37.51]And then the lightning will strike where he's supposed to be and it'll strike him instead of the church.
[20:41.84]And then the credits will roll like 15 minutes after that.
[20:49.47]That's literally not true.
[20:52.70]Okay.
[20:54.58]I must be thinking of a different game then.
[20:56.26]Not... Scrolls of the Elder.
[21:00.25]What's it called?
[21:03.03]I'm thinking of a Scrolls of the Elder 2.
[21:05.44]Which was... I actually don't remember it being 3D either.
[21:10.22]Which is kind of interesting.
[21:11.91]I thought it was 2D.
[21:13.67]But I guess the game's 3D.
[21:16.20]Is that so?
[21:16.96]It's you.
[21:18.13]Hi.
[21:18.87]Everybody hates this.
[21:22.29]What's this about?
[21:22.83]Good.
[21:26.76]A coin?
[21:27.92]I'm so hungry.
[21:29.36]You want a coin?
[21:29.90]I got a coin.
[21:30.88]Here.
[21:31.63]Thank you, kind sir.
[21:35.43]Got anything for me?
[21:36.25]Anyone looking for work should consider the Fighters Guild.
[21:40.04]I hear they're always looking for recruits.
[21:45.52]Where's that?
[21:49.36]Does every single city have a mage guild?
[21:52.69]Didn't I need to get recommended by everybody?
[21:55.07]I want to do that.
[22:01.12]I want to do the recommendation quests.
[22:09.75]They usually have an eye for the sign.
[22:11.89]Okay.
[22:18.78]What's going on with you?
[22:30.25]I don't need to sell anything.
[22:32.33]Oh, there it is.
[22:33.58]Let me do the quest here.
[22:36.56]I need to get recommendations from everywhere.
[22:43.33]Hi, it's... I don't know this guy's name.
[22:45.29]Why, hello there.
[22:47.15]You must be new.
[22:48.64]Oh, it's so nice to see new faces in the guild.
[22:51.83]If you ever need anything, just let me know.
[22:54.33]I have friends in all sorts of high places, you know, so I can get things done that others can't.
[23:01.15]And if I can do anything for you, I'd be happy to.
[23:05.15]Someday, maybe you could return the favor.
[23:10.36]Okay, so I want a recommendation.
[23:12.86]Can you rate that hair?
[23:18.29]Well, it's the McDonald's logo, so it gets an automatic A. I need to see the back.
[23:38.19]He's disappeared.
[23:40.11]I mean, he's really disappeared.
[23:42.25]No one here has seen him in days.
[23:44.70]Volinaro thinks maybe a spell backfired.
[23:47.30]I'll find him.
[23:48.04]If someone from the council were to stop by and find him gone, it'd look bad for me.
[23:52.94]I can't have that.
[23:54.25]I'll do it.
[23:54.59]Talk to the mages here and see what you can find out.
[23:58.27]If you can make Jaskar reappear, you'll have your recommendation.
[24:02.41]Done.
[24:03.40]Let's go.
[24:05.30]Please come find me as soon as you've located Jaskar.
[24:09.68]What did you do that for?
[24:12.56]Was that an intimidation tactic?
[24:17.99]Don't forget that while I'm joining the guild, I can do that too.
[24:24.18]Alright, we need to talk to people and find out where this guy is.
[24:33.57]Anybody know anything?
[24:41.52]Desk.
[24:41.96]Very easy.
[24:42.84]Wait, what do you mean?
[24:43.53]Ooh.
[24:49.22]Manual of Spellcraft?
[24:52.60]Oh.
[24:53.24]Uh-oh.
[24:53.82]Hold on.
[24:54.49]That's one that has to go in the swear jar.
[24:57.19]That's one...
[25:11.14]You just got softlocked?
[25:13.98]No, I didn't.
[25:20.41]Oh.
[25:24.16]Well, we're going to be good friends.
[25:35.47]Invisibility?
[25:38.03]Is he permanently invisible or something weird?
[25:50.63]Uh, spell backfired.
[25:55.55]Okay.
[25:58.74]You have the same haircut.
[26:06.37]Look, I like you and all, but I really don't want to get in the middle of this.
[26:12.84]If Valinara and Jaskar want to have their fun, fine.
[26:16.64]I'm not going to participate, and I'm not saying another word about it.
[26:23.39]Wait a minute.
[26:24.77]What do you know?
[26:25.51]What do you know?
[26:30.59]I'm afraid you're not...
[26:33.20]with all due respect to our wonderful leader she couldn't cast her she's but we have our ways of coping with the situation I'm listening I appreciate that well okay now that's sweet you think that's funny don't talk such rot
[27:03.46]You've got a point.
[27:04.90]That's amazing.
[27:06.70]Okay, so we're at 83.
[27:07.54]That works for me.
[27:08.58]Tell me what you know.
[27:11.25]You want to find Jaskar?
[27:13.43]Alright.
[27:14.05]I think I can help with that.
[27:15.43]But you have to agree to do something for me first.
[27:18.70]And whatever you do, you can't tell Jean about it.
[27:22.20]Alright?
[27:24.91]Okay.
[27:25.03]That's the spirit.
[27:27.11]You help me pull off a little prank, and I'll help you find Jaskar.
[27:31.84]Ooh, um, let's go.
[27:33.76]I'm into it.
[27:34.88]Really?
[27:35.49]You're going to love this.
[27:36.63]Tell me all about it.
[27:37.39]I'll teach you a spell to unlock things.
[27:39.73]What you need to do is get into Jean's desk and bring me her manual spell card.
[27:44.38]I already have it.
[27:44.98]Okay?
[27:46.14]Hey.
[27:46.26]Your room is upstairs.
[27:47.48]Valinaro.
[27:48.06]Make sure no one sees you.
[27:49.24]I already pranked her.
[27:49.91]You do that for me, and I'll make sure you can find Jaskar.
[27:53.39]That's how you know that I'm on the same page.
[27:55.71]This is where I pull it out of my pocket right now and I go, look, dude.
[28:01.62]That would be a huge bonding experiment between us.
[28:05.20]Just go unlock Jean's desk with that spell I taught you.
[28:09.20]Find her manual of spellcraft and bring it here to me.
[28:13.07]Her room should be easy to find.
[28:14.65]It's the... Okay, so let's... Let me know when you're done with that little task.
[28:23.06]Here it is.
[28:32.17]Living quarters at 10 p.m.
[28:37.71]You got it.
[28:38.39]What time is it right now?
[28:43.52]Where are the living quarters?
[28:44.36]Upstairs, right?
[28:53.62]Is this the living quarters?
[28:59.31]Alright, just after 10 p.m.
[29:00.53]So let's do 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[29:03.89]Let's do 7 hours.
[29:11.74]Then I can get down there and be ready to meet him.
[29:14.57]Okay.
[29:16.87]Down here or downstairs?
[29:24.82]Alright, what do you got?
[29:46.36]Bro?
[29:49.25]Bro.
[29:51.12]This is where I open this door and I walk in and a paint bucket lands on me with like ink in it and shit and he laughs at me.
[29:58.63]Oh, he's right there.
[29:59.23]I told you he was invisible.
[30:00.35]I could see him from a mile away.
[30:01.69]He's right here.
[30:02.40]Ready to find Jaskar?
[30:07.50]Just watch.
[30:08.47]You'll see.
[30:16.32]Found you.
[30:20.23]Okay.
[30:20.63]How about you just go say you're okay?
[30:46.54]Well, it was fun while it lasted.
[30:48.23]I'll have to start thinking up something new to try.
[30:51.09]There's not much to do here in the Bruma Guild.
[30:56.84]If you can get to the Arcane University, though, they let you make your own spells there.
[31:01.63]Really?
[31:01.97]I could make a lightning invisibility fireball?
[31:06.13]Frostcrag Spire has been uninhabited for so long.
[31:09.84]They say it was as wondrous as the Arcane University itself.
[31:16.01]Finding ways to confuse her just never gets old for me.
[31:20.19]It's good practice of our skills too, but it's mostly just funny.
[31:27.92]The Oblivion Gate is open and demons are pouring through, killing thousands of us.
[31:36.40]But your little magic show, you know, we could use mages of that particular skill.
[31:41.90]What the fuck are you doing?
[31:44.97]Oblivion Gate's gonna open in your backyard in about four or five days.
[31:49.83]Cut the shit, you two.
[31:51.78]And take up fireballs.
[31:53.94]You too.
[32:11.88]If you need me to teach you, I could teach you lightning out of your hands.
[32:15.81]Uh... She's gone.
[32:22.00]Guys.
[32:23.18]Guys, something bad happened.
[32:24.10]She's gone.
[32:32.83]What?
[32:33.06]Lightning out of your butthole.
[32:35.00]Hahaha.
[32:38.24]I still would be happy about it.
[32:39.88]I wouldn't even care.
[32:41.42]If you said that, hey, you love lightning and you love shooting lightning out of your fingertips, the only way you get to have that, you know, the monkey paw curls, you could have it, but you could only shoot it out of your butthole.
[32:51.88]I'd still be fine with it.
[32:52.84]I'd be like, that's fine.
[32:53.54]I don't care.
[32:56.30]I'm just imagining spinning around, bowing down really fast, and that is the trigger.
[33:01.69]That's the trigger on the ass bullet.
[33:04.25]You know what I mean?
[33:06.30]Spin around.
[33:07.87]Bow really fast.
[33:09.44]Head down to the ground.
[33:11.63]Out of the asshole.
[33:13.72]I would still do it.
[33:14.56]I wouldn't even care.
[33:22.05]You'd have to buy a new toilet every day.
[33:24.01]Why are you saying that?
[33:25.11]I'm telling you, the trigger for that would be stand, whip around 180 degrees, bow down fast, head down to crotch.
[33:33.72]And there's your, that's how you, and then it just aims where you're in a minute.
[33:38.42]He's so awesome.
[33:41.63]Where is this lady?
[33:47.53]Ace Ventura style.
[33:48.59]Yes, you get it.
[33:59.53]Most NPCs don't wake up till 8 a.m.
[34:02.17]Oh, shit.
[34:02.71]Okay.
[34:08.36]Hey, dude, that was literally in Home Alone 3.
[34:11.14]What are you talking about?
[34:13.03]Hold on.
[34:13.45]This is important.
[34:15.91]This is incredibly important.
[34:28.22]One sec.
[34:28.40]One sec.
[34:36.03]everybody freeze what do you mean this is in home alone three how come there's no sound on this
[35:15.65]I don't have sound on this but I don't think it really matters.
[35:39.49]What the fuck are you talking about?
[35:53.79]That is not what I'm talking about.
[35:56.57]I guess it's kind of close.
[35:58.70]I'm talking about... Dude, what the fuck was that?
[36:02.66]That was in the movie?
[36:12.11]oh god that was funny that was Dr. clay Dr. clay dropping the links tonight alright what am I doing oh I'm looking for you any luck finding just go
[36:32.26]I found him.
[36:32.96]Found him, did you?
[36:34.87]Well, I suppose that's good.
[36:38.11]You'll have to forgive me.
[36:39.73]I seem to have misplaced something.
[36:41.71]Could you guys even hear it?
[36:43.08]Because the audio, actually, I kind of heard it a little bit.
[36:45.64]But it actually made it better.
[36:47.64]You've fulfilled your end of the bargain, though.
[36:50.09]So I'll fulfill mine.
[36:51.43]That's got to be one of the crustiest videos I've ever opened.
[36:54.55]That thing was at like ADP.
[36:56.49]Once you've finished your training, I'm sure we can help each other out.
[37:05.22]Did I get it?
[37:06.84]I wasn't paying attention.
[37:08.94]Did I get the recommendation?
[37:12.93]Nice.
[37:17.07]That YouTube video was 1080p.
[37:21.03]How did it... Why was it so bad for you?
[37:23.00]What?
[37:23.24]It was awful.
[37:25.16]I don't understand.
[37:28.46]Oh, I just missed important dialog between those two.
[37:30.90]Hold on.
[37:40.94]You gotta lock in, man.
[37:43.91]I know, I know, I know.
[37:44.83]This is getting ridiculous.
[37:46.99]Okay.
[37:47.71]Well, I got another recommendation, so that's good.
[37:50.64]The next thing is... I'm not doing the main quest.
[37:56.22]Boring.
[38:02.75]Ooh.
[38:04.02]Nirnroot.
[38:07.56]Yeah.
[38:08.56]Let's do that.
[38:12.64]Let's go find out what the Nirnroot is.
[38:29.67]This dude hates lore.
[38:31.43]I am very, very consistent on this.
[38:34.14]This is not a new take of mine.
[38:37.17]This is not new.
[38:38.87]If right now a little, little like Clippy from, you know, Microsoft popped up in the corner and was like, would you like to hear about the condensed version of all the things that have happened?
[38:48.88]And I can click on it and it would just, whatever Clippy could just say, he could just tell me a paragraph of like kind of exactly what we, what was the game that did this?
[38:59.24]It was Final Fantasy, wasn't it?
[39:00.88]Final Fantasy, there was a game that did this recently.
[39:06.13]Final Fantasy XVI did this.
[39:07.93]They get it completely.
[39:12.66]You could pause at what genius level shit that they did.
[39:17.20]You could pause any cutscene in Final Fantasy XVI.
[39:23.71]And everybody in there, it would give you a one to two sentence explainer of who they were.
[39:29.56]And what the point of them being there was.
[39:32.60]It was awesome.
[39:33.81]Hail.
[39:35.96]It was so good.
[39:37.14]It was like the coolest thing ever.
[39:40.25]Caveman mode.
[39:40.91]That's right.
[39:44.27]It's get do TikTok synopsis.
[39:46.36]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[39:47.46]I'm talking about I want them in the game.
[39:49.12]I don't want them written by somebody that understands this game very well.
[39:54.41]It could be like an editorial.
[40:00.39]Good to see you.
[40:02.32]Hello.
[40:06.36]You're walking in circles.
[40:07.42]TikTok brain rot.
[40:08.82]Guys, I've never even opened TikTok once.
[40:11.04]I don't even know what the app looks like.
[40:20.78]Okay.
[40:27.04]You are famous on TikTok.
[40:34.19]Okay.
[40:34.58]Okay.
[40:37.47]Big time.
[40:42.14]He's TikTok famous, Omega Lull.
[40:44.46]Don't, don't do that.
[40:46.24]Don't do that.
[40:47.45]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[40:49.03]I'm not TikTok famous, okay?
[40:51.95]TikTok is the residual clips from what I've been doing here, okay?
[40:57.36]I'm residually famous on TikTok.
[40:59.72]That's what you should be thinking and saying.
[41:10.41]Your Instagram reels famous.
[41:12.38]I am residually Instagram famous reels on TikTok.
[41:16.30]Get it right.
[41:17.34]Don't fuck around.
[41:20.83]Blessed we are.
[41:22.37]Is this where I can learn it from?
[41:23.99]I'm Ditsan, magician.
[41:25.74]Mage's guild, that is.
[41:31.86]It's alright.
[41:32.95]The guild here, that is.
[41:34.15]That's what you meant, right?
[41:36.27]It's fine.
[41:36.87]I'm doing fine here.
[41:40.45]I'm afraid you'll have to speak to another recommendation.
[41:45.11]Don't mind if I do.
[41:46.84]Our hall doesn't offer much in the way of training.
[41:50.04]I can teach some basic alteration skills, but that's about it.
[41:59.01]Bye.
[42:08.18]Your Samsung smart fridge famous.
[42:14.52]gives a shit you can't even cut fruit that is toxic who owns this place I'm trayvon the red guard magus guild evoker surprised
[42:39.95]Yes, you don't see many Red Guards in the nature field.
[42:43.02]We don't much like spellcasters in Hammerfell.
[42:46.07]Wizards steal souls and tamper with minds.
[42:48.80]If you use magic, you're weak or wicked.
[42:51.60]My family didn't approve of my vocation, so I had to come to Cyrodiil for my education.
[42:56.89]I admit, I still have strong prejudices against necromancy, summoning, and illusion.
[43:02.42]Literally everything that I do.
[43:03.41]Profaning the remains or souls of the dead is just wrong.
[43:05.85]That is my whole character.
[43:06.63]And I'm uneasy about tampering with others' minds and trafficking with Deidre.
[43:13.08]You'll have to get one from Falkar if you can.
[43:16.13]Take care.
[43:16.41]He knows a lot about running his store.
[43:18.77]Of course, he's not the easiest person to talk to.
[43:26.78]Good to see you.
[43:41.93]Casually breaking the guild law.
[43:43.82]Yeah, but what you don't... What you don't understand is that... Remember, I'm so powerful and so kind of played by my own rules.
[43:52.42]People don't like that I do that.
[43:54.37]But I'm so powerful that... Okay, well, he's so powerful, so we have to let him kind of... Whatever, he's going to do that.
[44:01.51]So I get it.
[44:02.87]The laws.
[44:03.40]I'm an anti-human.
[44:06.14]Please, share your thoughts.
[44:19.63]Where's this person that I'm looking for?
[44:21.15]What's her name?
[44:28.40]No.
[44:33.15]Where's the leader?
[44:34.83]Falkar.
[44:35.23]Yeah, where's Falkar?
[44:43.03]Follow the red triangle?
[44:44.27]I mean...
[44:46.21]Red triangle is nothing.
[44:47.65]There's nowhere to go.
[44:49.34]Up the stairs all the way.
[44:51.64]I was just up here, wasn't I?
[44:54.20]In the basement.
[45:00.47]Greetings.
[45:05.14]This is not stealing, so don't get mad.
[45:08.70]Oh, there you are.
[45:09.85]He just was facing the wall.
[45:11.85]Yeah.
[45:14.38]Don't waste my time if you're not ready for this.
[45:16.92]Are you prepared to do what is necessary to gain a recommendation from me?
[45:23.19]Yep.
[45:23.29]Hmm.
[45:23.39]Very well.
[45:24.17]We shall see how prepared you actually are.
[45:27.54]There was a particular ring of burden I was testing some time ago.
[45:31.79]Another stupid associate somehow got his hands on it and managed to misplace it.
[45:37.54]if I didn't know better I'd say he purposely tossed it down the well behind the guild hall why he would do such a thing is beyond me you will retrieve this ring for me should you manage to do so I shall consider sending a recommendation to the university I can't wait till I can go to the university so you'll need the key should I have a copy of it now get moving okay
[46:03.73]It's not a normal ring, you see.
[46:06.10]You may find it slightly difficult to carry.
[46:09.08]Don't say I didn't warn you.
[46:12.73]I believe I explained your task very clearly.
[46:15.89]Find the ring.
[46:16.85]Would you somewhere down in the well?
[46:18.83]Do you understand?
[46:21.16]Good day.
[46:27.74]Remember, you should collab with Fortnite.
[46:30.58]Um, no.
[46:32.44]What?
[46:33.69]What are you talking about?
[46:35.47]A game I've never played and never will play?
[46:39.55]A game that I have no interest in playing?
[46:43.68]But I respect it!
[46:44.28]I respect it!
[46:44.86]Backtrack, Barry.
[46:45.84]Let's get that out there real quick.
[46:54.91]Uh, we didn't say somebody has the key.
[46:56.25]Who has the key?
[47:09.04]You played it?
[47:11.02]Yeah, and I threw a grenade and it bounced off of a wall and killed me.
[47:15.55]In a tournament.
[47:18.25]Good evening.
[47:18.85]Good day.
[47:22.04]Don't tell me Falkar has given you the same task he gave Vidkun.
[47:27.08]I will play Fortnite if they add the three stooges.
[47:29.32]Well, Falkar is the ranking member here and I don't feel comfortable talking about him.
[47:34.33]That's the only time you're going to see me play that on my own.
[47:36.09]I'll tell you what.
[47:37.31]And I will be on cam.
[47:39.13]There will be a huge LED sign behind me pointing down, blinking.
[47:44.82]Saying, I was right.
[47:47.28]Blinking.
[47:47.90]I was right.
[47:48.86]I was right.
[47:49.43]Pointing an arrow straight down.
[47:50.81]That is what I will do if they do that.
[47:55.25]That's the only way I'll play.
[47:58.22]Okay, so... Now I gotta...
[48:19.71]Should I just... Can I pickpocket?
[48:23.70]Please listen to the people you're talking to.
[48:25.14]It's been the last, like, two people.
[48:26.47]We've had a discussion going.
[48:34.18]It's persuasion, right?
[48:36.57]92?!
[48:38.23]!
[48:49.65]Goodbye.
[48:51.13]Wait till Falkar isn't around.
[48:55.22]When does Falkar go to bed?
[49:06.19]I find it surprising that you're speaking to me again without having completed your task.
[49:10.64]How do I get rid of him?
[49:11.40]Do I just yell that there's something going on out the window or something?
[49:14.18]I am the chapter head of the Chaden...
[49:18.22]You'd be so lost without chat.
[49:20.24]Actually, if I was playing this alone, my mouth would just be open.
[49:28.11]I would have a bag of popcorn next to me and I would be paying attention to every single thing.
[49:31.58]In fact, I think it's the chat being there that is part of the problem.
[49:34.86]So, I think you're wrong.
[49:38.11]Okay.
[49:47.92]find someone else to bother won't you so maybe he'll just go to bed let's see go offline then nah nah no let's not let's not get so hasty about that how do you do what's going on with you
[50:11.53]Many Argonians say they have been called back to Black Marsh.
[50:16.41]They disappear into the swamps and are never seen again.
[50:20.44]The land of the Argonians is a strange place indeed.
[50:25.19]See you.
[50:26.17]Take care.
[50:27.63]A visitor, yes.
[50:29.55]How are you today?
[50:31.05]Alright, he's going to bed.
[50:32.63]Ready?
[50:34.52]And bingo.
[50:36.38]Well met.
[50:38.44]We can talk, so long as Falkar is out of earshot.
[50:42.05]If I didn't know any better, I'd say he's trying to get you killed.
[50:46.60]He gave poor Vidkin the same task, and we never saw him again.
[50:51.31]I'm reasonably sure there's a connection, but I can't prove it.
[50:56.47]Why is chat being so weird and shitty?
[51:01.81]They're fine.
[51:03.41]Everyone's just fucking around.
[51:08.30]Some of you are fucking annoying.
[51:12.74]Yeah, we're good.
[51:13.76]Alright, let me pay attention to the game, please.
[51:25.61]I love how someone just wrote, am I being annoying with a sad face?
[51:31.04]No, we're good.
[51:32.06]Everybody just chill.
[51:39.43]So Falkar dropped this guy down the well.
[51:48.70]Said go get the key.
[51:51.01]Okay.
[51:57.67]I'm Ditsan, magician.
[52:00.94]Just perform the task you've been given.
[52:04.04]You too.
[52:05.22]Did he give me the key?
[52:09.11]Alright, this is the last time I'm not going to pay attention to what's going on.
[52:11.58]Did I get the key?
[52:16.20]Somebody in chat was being annoying.
[52:17.93]I had to look over and be like, what the fuck?
[52:40.04]Oh shit, I can't breathe.
[52:41.65]No wait, I I'm I'm I can breathe.
[52:48.61]Oh yeah, I'm a lizard.
[52:51.08]I can breathe.
[52:54.98]He did die down here.
[53:03.09]Whatever, is there anything else I can do?
[53:17.34]What about this?
[53:18.78]That's the plan I was looking for.
[53:23.27]You're the best parry shield in the game.
[53:24.69]Thanks, man.
[53:27.63]I was thinking about that when I picked it up.
[53:37.38]There's got to be something else down here, right?
[53:45.09]No?
[53:46.26]Ooh.
[53:46.56]Ooh.
[53:48.52]Yeah.
[53:50.04]This is where I came in.
[53:58.82]Wait.
[54:02.70]Wait, does Falco have a secret well chamber that he can throw people down?
[54:06.13]Oh, that would be crazy if he did.
[54:13.24]In his bedroom, he just has an open kind of ice fishing hole that he just, well, how would that work?
[54:19.96]Who cares?
[54:34.60]Hey, can we get a facecam?
[54:36.68]No, I turned facecam off until chat has a collective report card average of B+.
[54:43.23]Sorry.
[54:48.50]How can I help you today, friend?
[54:52.50]Yeah, I mean, the report cards came in.
[54:56.12]We got to start getting an average of a B or higher.
[55:06.97]Yes, honored guest.
[55:08.71]I'm afraid some things have happened while you've been gone, associate.
[55:12.60]It may affect your recommendation.
[55:17.20]I've been gone for 10 minutes.
[55:19.56]I'll admit, it's my doing.
[55:21.27]I couldn't leave well enough alone.
[55:23.27]And after you'd left to go after that ring, well... I'm just so tired of the way we've all been treated by Falkar.
[55:30.83]I was worried about you and angry about Vidkun, so I confronted Falkar directly.
[55:36.62]He was furious when I told him I'd helped you.
[55:39.87]And then when I threatened to report him to the Council of Mages, I thought he was going to kill me.
[55:45.57]So you killed him.
[55:46.02]He flew into a rage.
[55:47.90]I didn't even understand some of his ranting, but he said that our days are numbered, and then he stormed out.
[55:54.67]I don't know if he ever wrote your recommendation.
[55:57.83]I'm sorry.
[55:58.97]I didn't expect this to happen.
[56:01.03]Perhaps you should go look and see if he did write one.
[56:04.60]You should check his room in the living quarters.
[56:07.39]If you see the note or anything else unusual, let me know.
[56:11.21]I'll gladly send it to the council.
[56:13.40]Okay, so I gotta look in his room.
[56:14.70]What about the ring I have?
[56:15.64]Oh, just drop it anywhere.
[56:17.30]I don't think he really cared about it.
[56:19.08]I think it was some sort of sick joke on his part.
[56:22.33]Really?
[56:25.59]It's such a shame.
[56:27.72]He didn't deserve to die like that.
[56:29.94]What's up with this guy?
[56:31.50]I don't know what Archmage Traven has against necromancy, but the first thing he did after taking over the Mage's Guild was to ban its practice.
[56:42.64]Okay.
[56:43.92]I can train.
[56:44.20]There's much I can show you.
[56:47.12]It affects your ability to cast spells to breathe or walk on water.
[56:49.95]Open locks, reduce encumbrance, and shield yourself.
[56:54.01]Oh.
[56:56.64]This seems... Actually, I'm just going to do it.
[57:01.39]300 bucks?
[57:03.27]Why not?
[57:10.84]Can I pick more than one of these?
[57:12.54]Or am I locking myself into one special tree?
[57:23.72]You can do five points total per level.
[57:27.12]So I shouldn't do this then.
[57:33.92]It just gives some more XP.
[57:37.33]You can just level it yourself.
[57:38.43]Oh, OK.
[57:40.99]It's 15% of your gold.
[57:45.88]It just levels it up, OK.
[57:47.78]Alright, well, let's go.
[57:48.48]I need to take the ring off.
[57:55.85]Let's examine it first.
[58:00.61]Ring of Burden.
[58:04.48]Should I just throw it on the ground?
[58:05.30]What if this is worth... Is it worth anything?
[58:10.19]It's 150 pounds.
[58:10.77]I'm gonna put it right here.
[58:12.23]So it was just a prank.
[58:17.28]What's with these people pranking each other?
[58:19.20]That guy got pranked to death.
[58:28.78]Okay.
[58:34.81]I thought that was him laying in the bed.
[58:36.33]I was like, oh my God.
[58:39.86]Where's this special spot?
[58:48.72]Basement.
[58:54.05]How are you?
[59:03.04]I got a break coming up here.
[59:04.80]I'll take in a couple minutes.
[59:07.72]I'll do this first.
[59:13.37]You sick fuck.
[59:15.69]Are you kidding me?
[59:18.35]Adidas!
[59:20.43]Get down here.
[59:23.56]This sick fuck, I don't know what he's doing down here.
[59:25.06]There's somebody down here, chained up.
[59:31.52]Oh, that was a good one.
[59:33.79]OK.
[59:37.91]Looking for a note.
[59:51.63]Hmm.
[59:52.23]Hmm.
[59:57.82]Hmm.

[60:27.26]No, it isn't.

[61:10.43]Wait, there's no evidence of a recommendation in Falker's room, but I found black soul gems.

[61:20.30]Alright, I'll be right back.
[61:23.43]See you guys in a few minutes.

[66:45.76]What's that mean?

[67:27.06]Pickaxe, yup.
[67:32.91]Why do you need reassurance?

[67:44.24]Greetings.

[67:48.53]Speak louder.
[67:49.61]I'm talking fine.
[67:52.75]Alright.
[67:53.48]I'll just take these from you.
[67:55.04]I'll need them for my report to the council.
[67:58.20]Now, you didn't find any sort of recommendation?
[68:01.86]Very well.
[68:02.94]I shall write one myself and include it in my report to the council.
[68:06.65]Oh, but where did this guy go?
[68:07.63]In light of the circumstances, I believe they'll find it more than adequate.
[68:13.81]Okay, well I guess he just took off.
[68:16.56]Bye.
[68:23.81]So I've got three recommendations so far.
[68:27.20]There are, what, two or three more to get eventually?

[72:29.46]I locked myself out of his house.
[72:31.24]Wait, what is that?
[72:34.69]That's kind of creepy.
[72:35.59]Alright.
[72:36.25]I think you should leave.
[72:38.67]If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times, I've never been to Shadenhall.
[72:45.42]I... Oh, hang on.
[72:47.23]You're someone else.
[72:48.71]Apologies, my good friend.
[72:50.45]I mistook you for someone else.
[72:51.89]Why did I just get 50 bucks?
[72:52.77]Always being asked about it, I am.
[72:54.66]Didn't I see you in Shadenhall, they say?
[72:57.39]but I'm sick of it sick and tired tired and sick and perhaps a little drunk but never mind you look like the honest thought so I've got job for you okay you're going to travel to shane hall and find out what sort of imposter is trying to besmirch my good name and you're going to tell him you're going to tell him I'm quite capable of besmirching my good name on my own
[73:23.93]You should cease and desist immediately.
[73:26.90]There's 50 gold pieces in it for your friend right then.
[73:30.56]He already gave it to me.
[73:33.18]No, I'm sorry.
[73:33.73]It would have sold it way better if he did the puke into your mouth, swallow immediately thing.
[73:42.36]That's how you sell that one to me.
[73:45.64]This is your last warning.
[73:47.08]Get out or I'll call the guards and have you arrested.
[73:49.32]Wait, he just gave me a job.
[73:50.69]Okay, alright, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[73:54.14]Didn't he just give me a job?
[74:01.19]You snuck in at night.
[74:02.11]They don't like that.
[74:03.17]Oh.
[74:04.53]Nighttime.
[74:05.04]What time is it?
[74:05.66]8.30 in the morning.

[74:12.45]So I gotta go here.
[74:16.37]And figure out who's talking shit about him.
[74:28.53]Go, let's figure it out.
[74:42.97]Are you the shit talker?
[74:44.21]I don't care who you are.
[74:46.01]I ain't talking to you.
[74:47.65]You ain't from around here, so push off.
[74:52.56]So you must be the shit talker.
[74:54.12]No, Jermaine.
[74:55.36]No, don't know anyone by that name.
[74:57.71]There's a go bear Jermaine in town, however.
[75:00.11]Oh, maybe he can help you.
[75:02.10]He's staying over at the Newlands Lodge, but you also might find him walking around town.
[75:06.90]Good luck.
[75:08.91]Well, I appreciate that.
[75:11.37]What?
[75:15.72]I'm through talking to you.
[75:23.49]Cut so looking for him.
[75:26.37]Could be anywhere.
[75:31.75]Whether it's a sibling or a parent or something.
[75:36.25]Uh, here.
[75:41.22]Okay, what do you know?
[75:49.31]Okay, so we're looking for Gilbert.
[75:54.22]Gilbert?
[75:56.58]No.
[75:56.78]I didn't do anything.
[76:05.97]Gilbert?
[76:06.89]Do you know where Gilbert is?
[76:21.46]What?
[76:21.72]What did I do?
[76:25.15]What did I do?
[76:28.35]I didn't do anything!
[76:29.79]Current Bounty 1?
[76:31.33]Who did this?
[76:33.30]I don't understand.
[76:34.06]What did I do?
[76:38.05]That's too bad.
[76:38.97]I was hoping you'd resist arrest.
[76:42.16]How much do I have to pay?
[76:43.70]Here's the procedure.
[76:45.14]No!
[76:45.48]What?
[76:45.68]We go to the castle.
[76:46.94]First, we search you.
[76:48.27]One gold bounty?
[76:50.61]Then you pay your fine and we release you.
[76:53.96]This is absolute dog shit.
[76:56.12]I have to pay a one gold fine for why I didn't take anything.
[77:13.54]They took all your stolen items.
[77:17.86]Okay, a one gold fine.
[77:19.93]What did I do?
[77:23.99]What did I do?
[77:24.47]Did I steal like a plastic cup from somebody's counter or something?
[77:28.96]What crime is one gold?
[77:39.48]You talked too much shit.
[77:43.57]Alright, well, now we go in the barracks and I just take it all back.
[77:56.53]Oh, what a feast.
[77:58.70]Oh, a Thanksgiving feast.
[78:01.28]Nobody here, right?
[78:08.29]Yeah, there's your one gold.
[78:09.49]Shove it up your ass.
[78:13.41]That's quite a few coins, hold on.
[78:18.89]7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, there, that should do it.
[78:39.49]Do you know anything?
[78:45.13]Renald Germain?
[78:46.96]No, don't know anyone by that name.
[78:49.02]He's staying over at the Newlands Lodge.
[78:52.00]Newlands Lodge?
[78:53.00]Where is that?
[78:53.36]Have a good day now.
[78:57.43]That hurt.
[78:59.07]Spare a coin for the infirm?
[79:02.74]I would, but the amount of time it takes to do your dialog is the time that I'm not doing this.
[79:10.91]Where's the lodge?

[87:59.31]I can't believe I've been reunited with my brother.
[88:03.86]Okay, dude, back up.
[88:04.82]You haven't seen my sons, have you?
[88:06.54]No, I haven't.
[88:07.12]You went off into the forest to fight those monsters and I'm worried about them.
[88:10.74]You're way too into this.
[88:12.86]I can't thank you enough for helping to reunite me with Reynold.
[88:16.45]I never would have guessed he was still alive.
[88:19.07]We have much to discuss, but if you have time, I'd beg you to stay a moment longer and hear about our home, Weatherly.
[88:24.81]Sure, I would love to hear about it.
[88:27.15]Weatherly was our family's home for generations.
[88:29.97]Our parents fled it when ogres attacked.
[88:32.27]They became separated.
[88:33.93]My father carried me to safety.
[88:35.90]He later returned and believed Reynold and my mother had perished.
[88:39.10]Since ogres are cannibals, he didn't expect to find their bodies.
[88:43.58]Thankfully, however, it seems that my mother managed to carry Reynold to safety.
[88:48.19]While my mother didn't survive, Reynold did, and for that I'm grateful.
[88:52.84]But we both want more.
[88:54.86]We want our home back.
[88:56.62]We're not fighters.
[88:58.17]You appear to have more skill than either of us.
[89:00.25]I got it.
[89:01.07]Would you go to Weatherly and see if it's still inhabited by ogres?
[89:04.14]I will take care of it because I like you two and I got 50 bucks.
[89:07.55]That's the most amount of money anybody's given me in this game so far.
[89:10.55]Thank you.
[89:11.85]Now, we're not quite sure where the estate is located.
[89:14.32]We'll offer up what we know, however.
[89:16.86]We believe it's somewhere south of Coral, but north of Fort Kamala.
[89:20.40]It may be difficult to find.
[89:22.01]Since no one's lived there for many years, it may be quite overgrown by now.
[89:27.43]If you find it, let us know.
[89:28.57]We'll be waiting anxiously.
[89:32.08]I wish my father had given me a better description of its location, but for some reason all he told me was south of Coral, north of Fort Kamala.
[89:42.95]Be careful.
[89:44.34]I don't know what dangers may lurk in the great forest.
[89:50.47]What are they doing?
[89:54.94]That was just two goats.
[89:57.00]One of them, they're trying to see who's the alpha.
[90:01.35]It was like a bull standoff.
[90:02.95]You see that in the wild.
[90:07.73]He's like, oh, are you here to talk to me?
[90:17.70]No, I haven't.
[90:19.61]Do you know where this place is?
[90:26.66]Ooh.
[90:29.32]Fighters Guild.
[90:31.60]Any rumors?
[90:32.21]I don't understand what Glistel is doing with Melinda Zankratz.
[90:35.77]I mean have you seen her?
[90:37.57]And have you seen him?
[90:38.80]I just don't get it.
[90:47.01]I'm listening.
[90:50.23]Don't waste your flattery on me.
[90:55.06]Is that so?
[90:59.41]gracious what a hero yeah trying to hate me oh my sons my poor sons who will help them now you're really gonna get that you're gonna throw that at me when I'm walking out the front door okay
[91:22.99]Eh.
[91:24.63]Talk.
[91:30.02]Where are they?
[91:39.18]Mm-hmm.
[91:46.92]My boys will take up the fight, even if the guards won't.
[91:50.62]It doesn't matter if it's outside the town walls.
[91:53.08]It still affects us all.
[91:55.59]They expect me to go with them, but I... I fear in my village I'm not the warrior I once was.
[92:02.43]Would you... Would you go in my place?
[92:08.36]Somehow, I knew you'd do the right thing.
[92:12.04]I'm supposed to meet them at Wayne and Priory.
[92:14.63]You'd best get whatever supplies you need now.
[92:17.16]So you can get there in time.
[92:19.30]I need a drink to calm my nerves.
[92:21.85]And you send the same email 10 to 15 different times over the course of six or seven months.
[92:27.94]I just have to imagine you're not going to get a reply.
[92:31.55]Okay.
[92:41.66]Alright, let's go adventuring.
[92:44.58]It's time.
[92:45.48]We can find out info.
[92:48.19]We go to the fighters guild.
[92:50.07]I want to know where that is.
[92:51.57]I think it's right here.
[92:56.80]Do these quests.
[92:57.76]That's the plan.
[92:59.68]The plan is to do those right now.
[93:06.69]Did he say miss me?
[93:12.81]Nope.
[93:14.49]Excellent.
[93:15.10]You are a lifesaver.
[93:47.15]What'd you just take?
[93:48.21]What'd he take?
[93:48.67]He just took a chicken leg.
[93:49.48]That's illegal.
[93:50.20]He cheated.
[93:50.66]That's illegal.
[93:52.32]He just took a chicken leg.
[93:53.28]I'm not allowed to eat your... He's allowed to eat this?
[93:57.67]He just took a chicken leg.
[94:09.31]He just took a chicken leg.
[94:10.43]That just sounded like a chicken.
[94:14.47]Can you jump this high?
[94:24.99]No.
[94:25.57]This ain't my horse!
[94:39.23]Hey!
[94:41.68]Wait, get back here!
[94:43.68]That's not my horse!
[94:44.80]This is a stolen one!
[94:48.64]Where's the horse that I brought here?
[94:49.91]Did that guy just take my horse?
[94:55.39]Hey!
[95:02.28]Give that back!
[95:05.50]That's not my horse.
[95:06.23]Okay, that horse is black, I think.
[95:15.19]So what happened?
[95:16.95]Why is that one now?
[95:17.85]Did Martin take the one that was supposed to be me riding?
[95:22.10]Did he just check the stables?
[95:35.17]Oh, there you are.
[95:48.58]Alright, we are... here we go.
[95:51.77]Alright, Weather Lay.
[95:55.00]Go take this place back.
[95:57.35]Two boys.
[96:21.56]Apparently there's a bunch of ogres here.
[96:26.23]When dear?
[96:29.97]Alright, remember where this is.
[96:40.41]Wendy's I've been winning in so long I really want it.
[96:45.46]When was the last time you had Wendy's?
[96:47.74]I don't know why it's been so long.
[96:50.80]Been a couple of years, honestly.
[96:55.25]Is it good?
[96:55.69]My problem with fast food... I just... When I haven't had it for a very long time, I'm scared to eat it again because who knows if it sucks now.
[97:11.64]Oh, shit.
[97:12.05]Hold on.
[97:19.19]How hard is this?
[97:28.96]Do they talk?
[97:40.17]Okay, not bad.
[97:44.94]Ogre teeth.
[97:45.58]These things are worth a lot of money.
[97:47.72]You ranked Wendy's bottom C tier.
[97:52.73]Yeah, but that's, I mean, that, whatever.
[97:57.05]Junior bacon cheeseburger is amazing.
[98:06.39]This move is great.
[98:11.65]I don't know what people were talking about.
[98:12.79]Did I just scream like that?
[98:30.32]I found Weatherly south of Korra, but it's overrun with ogres.
[98:32.78]I should report this information to Gilbert.
[98:35.34]Why wouldn't I just kill everybody?
[98:41.91]I'm gonna go tell on the ogres.
[98:43.39]I know they're here.
[98:43.97]Alright, you're strong.
[99:05.03]Rakshen.
[99:10.35]Yeah, why would I do that?
[99:12.34]Why?
[99:12.60]I could just kill the three ogres and then go back and go tell him their ogres are there for them.
[99:20.43]We come back and kill the ogres later.
[99:22.13]No.
[99:31.18]They might help you fight them.
[99:32.86]OK, well this place is trashed.
[99:41.43]Pretty sick pizza oven though.
[99:54.43]Nothing.
[99:58.67]Keep blind, I'll take it.
[100:08.07]Why is he RP walking?
[100:09.49]Nobody said that, but some of you were thinking it because I want to go through slowly.
[100:16.34]A lot of dead people in here.
[100:18.58]How many people were in this person's family?
[100:20.73]There's like 40 people here.
[100:25.79]What the hell is going on?
[100:33.02]I see one bed.
[100:49.18]The human pizza?
[100:54.54]There's nothing else in here.
[100:57.07]There's no family jewels or something.
[101:01.71]Well, alright, we did it.
[101:02.91]So what about this other one?
[101:03.72]What about this guy's sons?
[101:05.04]I'll do this too.
[101:11.26]You missed it.
[101:14.65]You missed it, you missed it, you missed it.
[101:19.74]Somebody said there's a locked cupboard.
[101:35.70]I don't see anything.
[101:46.72]Oh, I just get one guy.
[101:47.62]Okay.
[101:59.46]Alright, so the next one.
[102:01.03]This guy's sons.
[102:09.92]Okay, uh, going to fight creatures that have been appearing in the woods outside of coral.
[102:16.08]So, right here, I guess.
[102:20.69]Shit my horse, whatever.
[102:29.13]Hey, we're saved up.
[102:32.18]Good.
[102:33.91]OK there.
[102:36.56]Gentlemen.
[102:38.58]Antus, calm down.
[102:40.62]We'll be leaving soon enough.
[102:42.93]I just can't wait.
[102:44.39]This is going to be the greatest fight ever.
[102:46.55]This is no joke, Antus, and it's nothing to be excited about.
[102:51.04]If you don't want to be doing this, then why are you even here?
[102:54.03]Father and I can handle this.
[102:55.89]I'm here because even though I'm afraid, I know that we have to do this.
[103:00.92]Father would feel the same way.
[103:02.76]I'm here.
[103:05.41]I'm here because your father sent me here.
[103:17.23]What?
[103:28.09]Little shit.
[103:30.53]Here, take ten bucks and fuckin' be a little nicer to me.
[103:45.95]Alright, we cool now?
[103:53.02]What about you?
[103:54.72]Are you going to be smarter about this?
[104:00.45]Alright, tap a big sack of coins on my pants.
[104:17.74]Alright, men.
[104:28.36]Let's go.
[104:28.96]Out with your swords.
[104:32.78]Yes, we're supposed to do the same Kevin O'Leary stance from Shark Tank.
[104:55.32]I'll give you the $400,000, but I want a 15% royalty until I'm paid back.
[105:01.21]That might sound bad, but if you think Mark over there is going to give you a better deal, I want a 15% royalty.
[105:10.44]Hurry it up, Gramps.
[105:11.76]The game is going as fast as it can.
[105:26.76]There it is.
[105:28.40]Alright, ready your swords.
[105:31.82]Let's go.
[105:41.74]Can we see what your character looks like without the helmet?
[105:43.36]If I take the helmet off, I'll die.
[105:48.17]It's connected to my brain stem.
[106:01.96]It's the place.
[106:04.38]Oh, it's overrun.
[106:05.40]It's overrun by one rat and two other creatures, which will never be, we would never name them.
[106:11.79]What is in here?
[106:12.95]We are not taking this seriously.
[106:20.67]There's nothing here.
[106:30.34]It's just this way.
[106:31.62]I thought he was mad that I was taking his berries.
[106:33.95]I think I'm ready for this.
[106:35.51]But I worry about Antus.
[106:36.55]He's never fought before?
[106:37.71]He's never seen a fight like this before.
[106:39.73]Save.
[106:40.21]I've saved like three times.
[106:41.93]The farm is near.
[106:42.89]Stay close.
[106:53.66]Defeat the creatures.
[106:56.21]Filthy vermin.
[106:58.52]Stay focused, watch your backs, and be careful.
[107:02.41]Antus, are you ready?
[107:04.53]Yeah, I'm ready.
[107:05.37]Let's go!
[107:06.09]Let's go!
[107:06.45]Defend yourselves!
[107:08.09]Here they come!
[107:08.78]Here they come!
[107:10.16]Where?
[107:11.48]Oh shit!
[107:14.44]Creatures!
[107:26.02]He didn't do anything.
[107:37.60]there's actually a lot of them I actually don't want one I don't want them to die stay back stay backstage just get behind me
[108:05.43]What do you mean the goblins have been defeated?
[108:07.33]There's 10 of them!
[108:09.58]What are you talking about?
[108:17.17]This is impossible!
[108:23.82]How are they ever gonna make it out alive?
[108:35.60]Dude, there was so many!
[108:36.97]It's a glitch that spawns more than it's supposed to.
[108:42.31]Should I reload it?
[108:43.91]Is he gonna be pissed that both of his kids are gone?
[108:48.40]Ooh, hold on.
[108:59.20]No, you gotta ride with it?
[109:00.08]Whatever.
[109:00.54]I don't... that was a lot of people.
[109:11.33]I'm gonna have to live with it.
[109:12.25]I don't care.
[109:14.91]I mean, that sucks.
[109:21.56]What's in here?
[109:25.67]You're missing out on a legendary weapon if you don't.
[109:28.21]Are you kidding?
[109:28.86]Is that for real?
[109:29.98]Tell me the truth.
[109:31.80]Reload, please.
[109:32.54]Reload, reload, reload.
[109:33.48]Is that an actual weapon?
[109:37.41]Yes.
[109:38.43]Okay.
[109:39.97]Alright.
[109:41.67]You get five potatoes, dude.
[109:43.11]Don't.
[109:43.57]Are you serious?
[109:44.15]I don't know what to do.
[109:45.19]I reloaded.
[109:47.52]Okay, this time let's not have 20 of them spawn at the same time.
[109:59.45]You only get the quest reward if you save them both.
[110:03.24]Well, what if it happens again?
[110:16.63]Don't fuck it up this time.
[110:18.64]I don't think it's possible to save them if there are 10 goblins attacking at the same time.
[110:23.00]I'm only one person with one skeleton friend.
[110:43.35]Stardew Valley this.
[110:44.17]Here we go.
[110:54.00]No.
[110:54.82]No, they took everything.
[110:56.52]They took everything, my sons.
[111:06.33]Alright, here we go.
[111:20.67]Don't even let them walk over here.
[111:22.37]Just take all the heat.
[111:45.75]come on oh my god good okay we're fine don't die please yes okay I'm good pathetic
[112:27.04]Take everything before I do this.
[112:31.53]Iron Mace, damn.
[112:33.03]Actually, that thing sucks.
[112:39.06]Vinny had like 50 show up?
[112:40.75]Oh my god.
[112:48.72]So I just have to go back?
[112:49.58]Hold on, let me just go back first.
[112:53.51]They just didn't stop?
[112:56.61]Watch the clip.
[112:57.31]Hold on.
[113:05.00]Let me get it up here.
[113:19.38]So this is when Vinny played.
[113:22.42]See?
[113:25.97]Alright, this is when Vinny did it let's see what happened Someone in chat said there was a bug here for them and it spawned like a hundred goblins Whoa
[113:57.97]Oh, my God.
[113:58.55]Is that normal?
[114:00.79]Oh, God.
[114:07.68]That is so funny.
[114:21.78]That's amazing.
[114:22.58]That is actually amazing.
[114:25.73]The goblins have been defeated.
[114:27.85]Oh, man, that's great.
[114:37.08]Oh, man, I kind of want to reload it.
[114:46.50]And I'll tell you one reason why, and it might derail the entire rest of the whole screen.
[114:51.61]If I can get this to happen again and have like a hundred of them spawn and I walk them to a town, will it be like a storm wind versus like the fucking Zaraxus or whatever?
[115:07.82]You can just do it in the console.
[115:09.18]Oh, that's true.
[115:09.94]Never mind.
[115:11.08]That's right.
[115:11.50]I forgot you could do that.
[115:14.57]You can just spawn them in the console.
[115:18.81]I would be giving myself way more work.
[115:22.41]It would take like two hours.
[115:23.65]OK, well, whatever we're good.
[115:25.62]That's so funny though.
[115:28.08]That's a great clip.
[115:37.84]Alright, so you said I get a legendary item for this well met.
[115:43.43]You're not lying.
[115:50.37]You should save it.
[115:51.09]Save it.
[115:51.41]Save it.
[115:51.77]Okay.
[115:51.97]I did it.
[115:52.33]I did it.
[115:52.59]I'm good.
[116:03.77]Alright.
[116:04.65]I brought everybody back.
[116:06.39]Wait.
[116:09.34]Oh.

[116:17.76]Wonderful.
[116:19.22]Weatherly is ours.
[116:20.74]Are you ready to take us there now?
[116:24.89]Yeah.
[116:26.97]Is that fine?
[116:28.90]That's not going to mess up the other thing, right?
[116:33.00]I can just do this now, right?
[116:36.37]Right.
[116:37.27]We're off.
[116:40.50]Okay.
[116:40.62]We're off.

[117:12.96]Thanks so much for sticking with them and helping a foolish old man.
[117:16.82]Are you ready for five yummy potatoes?
[117:18.54]Take this.
[117:19.48]I won't be needing it any longer.
[117:21.81]My battles are over.
[117:24.77]I plan to live out my days on the farm in peace.
[117:28.07]With all of my carrots that I've been harvesting and all my wheat.
[117:32.08]Chill rend added to the player's inventory.
[117:35.96]It was chill rend.
[117:36.82]Stop talking.
[117:37.82]Enough.
[117:46.30]Um, excuse me?
[117:47.52]This thing is... 3 damage.
[117:53.33]Frost damage on strike.
[117:54.87]8 points of... Wait, that's actually kind of... Wait, is this terrible?
[118:01.60]Weakness to frost.
[118:02.48]This thing does like 11 damage.
[118:04.84]Whoa!
[118:05.66]This thing's sick looking.
[118:07.76]Let's test it on you.
[118:09.45]Tell me if this hurts.
[118:13.09]This thing is... Whoa, look at this thing!
[118:15.35]I like it.

[131:01.14]Good work.
[131:01.86]I am glad to see you, by the way.
[131:03.30]You just caught me at a bad time.
[131:07.73]it's not gonna kill him right the assassins who killed the emperor were part of a deirdre cult known as the mythic dawn apparently worship the deirdre lord may runes dagon I've been tracking their agents in the imperial city I guess they noticed here another mythic dawn gameplay commentary yeah what they took it from joffrey things are worse than I had thought
[131:33.04]I also found this.
[131:33.98]Thank Talos he lives.
[131:36.03]Martin Septim, you say?
[131:37.53]We will restore him to the throne.
[131:39.17]It is the sworn duty of all blades.
[131:43.52]What do we do now?
[131:44.40]There's a scholar at the Arcane University.
[131:46.71]Tarmeen is her name.
[131:48.21]Supposed to be an expert on Daedric cults.
[131:50.89]Why don't you take that book to her?
[131:52.80]See what she makes of it.
[131:54.40]I'll keep running down leads on the Mythic Dawn network.
[131:57.28]And may Talos guide you as well.
[132:04.85]Got it.
[132:05.85]Alright, let's go.
[132:08.12]I hope you're not like this permanently.
[132:20.80]Any jewels?
[132:22.16]Ooh, wait a minute.
[132:24.81]Wait a minute.
[132:26.53]Look at how hard this one is.
[132:35.37]Shit.
[132:51.92]What kind of stupid asshole puts a brum and a shovel in the hardest lock possible?
[133:00.81]Why is there nothing in there?
[133:03.93]Watch this.
[133:04.65]Inside this one, there's going to be a bunch of diamonds or something.
[133:20.68]Okay, I'll take one gold.
[133:26.11]That was a bust.
[133:37.24]Hail.
[133:38.35]What do you need, friend?
[133:39.65]Hail.
[133:49.78]Everybody needs a copy of the Black Horse Courier.
[133:54.35]Well, now I'm interested.
[134:01.80]Very nice.
[134:05.45]Thank you.
[134:12.64]Mythic Dawn book will teach us skill.
[134:19.21]Really?
[134:24.63]A game at dinner?
[134:31.08]Mikey, this thing's 200 bucks.
[134:39.95]I gotta eat the evidence.

[134:51.76]I got 17 lettuce?
[134:57.84]OK.
[135:01.70]Read the book.
[135:03.46]Did I learn something?
[135:06.33]I got extra conjuration.
[135:09.29]All citizens are welcome in the Imperial Palace, at least on the first two floors.
[135:14.94]It's a huge tower.
[135:26.07]Oblivion!
[135:38.98]Here we go.
[135:44.40]I'm going.
[136:14.13]Ooh, almost level five.
[136:15.41]Hold on.
[136:15.69]Wait, wait, wait.
[136:17.87]I'm level five right now.
[136:19.33]I gotta sleep in somebody's bed.
[136:21.78]Or mine.
[136:22.62]I don't know.
[136:23.04]I don't own one.
[136:29.12]Speak.
[136:31.55]Battle Mage.
[136:32.13]Hail, good mage.
[136:33.63]Welcome to the Arcane University.
[136:36.15]Is there anything I can help you with?
[136:37.49]Can I learn some new stuff?
[136:43.06]Eh.
[136:43.14]Farewell, citizen.
[136:49.96]You could buy a house here in the city.
[136:56.24]Good to see you.
[136:58.01]I'll pay handsomely if you can procure the items on that list.
[137:01.99]Find me everything on there and you'll be well compensated.
[137:05.98]On that list?
[137:09.16]Okay.
[137:10.97]Goodbye.
[137:13.95]Hello.
[137:15.59]Ah, you must be the one I got the message about.
[137:17.98]How can I help you?
[137:21.28]I can learn spells from these?
[137:33.85]Cool.
[137:34.40]What about recommendation?
[137:39.78]How do I kill him?
[137:48.16]Ah, yes.
[137:50.00]Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes.
[137:53.50]Wonderful.
[137:55.06]You have a scholarly interest in Daedric cults, then?
[138:00.46]Find them, eh?
[138:01.96]I won't poke my nose any further.
[138:04.05]Official business and all that.
[138:06.03]I'm used to working with the blades.
[138:08.01]Don't worry.
[138:09.04]Say no more.
[138:10.50]In any case, finding them won't be easy.
[138:13.76]I've studied Mankar Cameron's writings a bit myself.
[138:17.37]At least those that I could find.
[138:20.35]It is clear from the text that Mankar Cameron's commentaries come in four volumes, but I've only ever seen the first two books.
[138:29.49]I believe that his writings contain hidden clues to the location of the Mythic Dawn's secret shrine to Mehrunes Dagon.
[138:37.54]Those who unlock this hidden path have proven themselves worthy to join the ranks of the Mythic Dawn.
[138:44.91]Finding the shrine is the first test.
[138:47.78]If you want to find them, you'll need all four volumes of the commentaries.
[138:54.12]Here, you can have the library's copy of volume two.
[138:57.87]Treat it gently, if you please.
[139:00.49]As I've said, I've never even seen the third and fourth volumes.
[139:04.63]You should try first edition over in the market district.
[139:08.30]First edition.
[139:08.88]Phintius, the proprietor, caters to specialist collectors.
[139:13.26]He may have an idea of where to locate those books.
[139:18.22]Okay.
[139:21.92]How do I get the big press on fingernail?
[139:33.94]Alright, fine.
[139:49.37]Ogre acrylics.
[139:53.50]You got to get all the small town recommendations to enter the university.
[140:04.80]Alright.
[140:08.60]What is it, citizen?
[140:21.45]Oh, I almost made it.
[140:36.81]Go level up, that's the plan.
[140:43.14]This is the game with the music from those funny memes.
[140:49.75]Yes, that is true.
[140:50.93]That's accurate.
[141:00.49]That's what I was thinking.
[141:10.20]Go get this book.
[141:19.16]Okay.
[141:22.59]Hi.
[141:22.87]You know, do you have any of those... secret books?
[141:35.07]You know what I mean?
[141:37.66]You must be referring to Mankart Cameron's commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes.
[141:42.87]A common mistake.
[141:44.52]It comes in four volumes.
[141:46.14]The first two volumes are rare, but you may run across them from time to time.
[141:50.27]The third and fourth are impossible to find.
[141:53.64]I need those volumes.
[141:54.62]I happen to have a copy of volume three on here.
[141:56.72]What?
[141:57.06]But I'm afraid it is a special order.
[142:00.63]What are you talking about?
[142:01.51]They need to say three and four were impossible.
[142:04.77]I have it, by the way.
[142:05.55]Terribly disappointed if it was gone when he came to pick it up.
[142:09.38]So sorry, I can't help you.
[142:16.46]So just go kill this person.
[142:18.07]I don't know him personally.
[142:19.84]But he was very eager to get his hands on volume three of Cameron's commentaries.
[142:24.45]Came all the way from Valenwood.
[142:26.17]As a matter of fact, he's already late for his appointment to pick up the book.
[142:30.06]Feel free to wait for him if you want to speak to him yourself.
[142:32.34]I would absolutely love to do that.
[142:35.97]I'm afraid I couldn't sell it to you.
[142:37.95]Okay, what about the four?
[142:39.49]I wish I had one, but I have never even seen a copy.
[142:44.68]Okay.
[142:45.74]Good day.
[142:48.25]That was rude.
[142:51.97]Alright, so we wait for this guy.
[142:52.90]Is there a certain time that he's coming?
[143:02.99]Told me that Gwynass is on his way to pick up his copy.
[143:06.66]I should wait for him.
[143:10.30]Okay, so I'm just going to wait for him?
[143:18.02]I need to level up.
[143:20.61]Do I have time to sit around and wait for Gwynass?
[143:22.95]That's Gwynass right there.
[143:26.74]Wait.
[143:28.20]Wait.
[143:32.27]Oh, fuck you.
[143:45.32]I'm here for my book, Mancar Cameron's Commentaries, Volume 3.
[143:49.19]I didn't get to do that.
[143:50.07]Of course, here you go.
[143:51.88]Keep us in mind for any future needs.
[143:54.19]Thank you.
[143:54.83]Thank you.
[143:55.41]I can't tell you how long I've been looking for this book.
[143:59.30]Good to see you.
[144:00.50]What's going on with you?
[144:01.74]I heard there was some goblins around here recently.
[144:04.91]Awful creatures.
[144:06.37]Horrid beasts.
[144:07.29]I hate the things.
[144:08.69]Take care.
[144:09.10]Bye.
[144:10.20]Do they just have a regular just default NPC conversation right now?
[144:13.48]I wish to be left alone.
[144:14.94]I'm waiting.
[144:16.23]Give me that book.
[144:18.83]Have you been following me?
[144:20.09]Leave me alone.
[144:21.74]That book is mine.
[144:24.01]Gave me the book.
[144:28.02]It is.
[144:29.82]I'm threatening you.
[144:31.30]Oh.
[144:32.93]Really?
[144:33.65]No, you won't.
[144:34.43]Oh.
[144:37.43]Oh.
[144:40.48]You're in way over your head, buddy.
[144:42.74]That festival is about me.
[144:58.23]I'm the mad one they speak of in the book.
[145:03.58]What?
[145:04.66]The Mythic Dawn were the ones?
[145:06.63]You have to believe me.
[145:07.87]I truly had no idea.
[145:09.39]I mean, I knew they were a Daedric cult.
[145:11.92]Mankar Cameron's views on Mehrunes Dagon are fascinating.
[145:15.22]Revolutionary even.
[145:16.05]And I can prove it.
[145:16.57]Look at this tattoo of my own.
[145:17.63]It says, Mad One.
[145:19.19]Mara, preserve us.
[145:23.36]And it's in like a crazy font, so you know I'm fucked up.
[145:29.55]Give me that book.
[145:30.11]Yes, of course.
[145:31.70]I don't want anyone to think I had anything to do with their insane plots.
[145:35.40]Here, Volume 3 is yours.
[145:37.14]What you do with it is your business.
[145:40.42]Give me the fourth one, too.
[145:41.68]You find it for me, dweeb.
[145:44.09]You can only get Volume 4 directly from a member of the Mythic Dawn.
[145:47.87]I had set up a meeting with the sponsor, as he called himself.
[145:51.27]Here, take this note they gave me.
[145:53.42]It tells you where to go.
[145:54.76]I don't want anything else to do with the Mythic Dawn.
[145:59.19]See how easy that was?
[146:02.15]Make it quick.
[146:08.46]Just go away.
[146:10.42]OK, so give me the other one.
[146:11.38]What?
[146:15.05]I had a copy of.
[146:18.93]Good day.
[146:20.04]Hey, well, where's the first one?
[146:27.49]I gotta look at this note.
[146:36.02]I left so much dog shit.
[146:43.22]Note to Gwyneth.
[146:44.01]Here we go.
[146:45.12]Your interest in the writings of the Master has been noted.
[146:47.72]You are taking the first steps towards true enlightenment.
[146:50.57]Persevere, and you may yet join exalted ranks of the Chosen.
[146:54.16]If you wish to continue further down the Path of Dawn, you will need the fourth volume of the Master's Commentaries on the Mysterium's Arxes.
[147:00.61]It can be obtained only from a member of the Order of the Mythic Dawn.
[147:03.99]As your designated sponsor, I will pass on my copy to you if I deem you worthy.
[147:07.58]Study the first three volumes of the master's writings.
[147:10.14]Look for the hidden meaning in his words, as best you are able.
[147:13.29]When you are ready, come to the sunken sewers under the air of the imperial city.
[147:17.99]Come alone.
[147:18.41]Follow the main tunnel until you reach the room with the table and chair.
[147:21.75]Sit down.
[147:22.19]I'll meet you there, and I'll give you what you desire.
[147:28.80]Alright.
[147:30.56]Study the first three volumes.
[147:32.08]Look for the hidden meanings.
[147:34.23]Come to the sunken sewers under the elven gardens.
[147:39.00]I don't need to read any books.
[147:41.91]I've got a fucking serious swinging arm.
[147:47.76]I want to strike you with lightning so bad, but I'll get arrested.
[147:56.51]Why do you bother me?
[147:57.87]Go away.
[148:00.86]You could feel the wind on that.
[148:13.78]You know, I'm gonna beat the illiterate allegations.
[148:19.91]I just eloquently read a whole thing of dialog almost perfectly cleanly.
[148:27.04]No practice.
[148:28.54]No reading it beforehand.
[148:34.53]Summarize it.
[148:36.29]I can perform it.
[148:37.09]I can't tell you what it was.
[148:45.30]well met why doesn't want to go in here hail found out what you're not easy to get hold of what have you found out about the books they'll pay for the murder of the emperor now that we know who they are it's only a matter of time that it was in the sewers this just might be the break we've been looking for good work we need to get that fourth book then
[149:14.89]If Tarmina is right, we can use these books to locate the Mythic Dawn's hidden shrine.
[149:20.69]Let's go.
[149:21.85]I know that part of the sewers well.
[149:23.71]Go.
[149:25.18]The sewers run underneath the whole Imperial City.
[149:28.60]The Blades have occasion to use them in our undercover... Let's go.
[149:32.10]Follow me.
[149:33.44]I know how to get to the part of the sewers... Wait, can I level up first?
[149:37.39]Luther Broad's boarding house.
[149:39.31]I want a bed.
[149:39.81]If you've got ten gold, I've got a room for the night.
[149:44.60]I'll take it.
[149:45.22]We'll sleep for three hours.
[150:13.31]Alright, let's do strength.
[150:16.97]Uh, will.
[150:19.87]Intelligence.
[150:23.28]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[150:24.82]I'm just dumping points into the same two or three stats.
[150:26.77]Is that stupid?
[150:30.27]What about endurance?
[150:31.35]Maybe endurance.
[150:34.42]Constitution's not on here, which is a fucking joke.
[150:51.88]I'm happy with this.
[150:53.21]I think that's good.

[163:04.26]Let's go.
[163:04.84]I'm going to go to the sewers.
[163:15.50]Get a long chicken.
[163:17.56]That sounds great, actually.
[163:18.84]Burger King sucks, but not that.
[163:35.19]Wanted.
[163:35.59]The Gray Fox.
[163:38.08]Wears a gray cloak that conceals his appearance.
[163:40.08]Presumed male and colovian.
[163:42.70]Height between 5 and 6 feet.
[163:44.80]Normal weight.
[163:45.46]Hair and eye color unknown.
[163:49.59]Okay, so I see this guy.
[163:50.43]I get him.
[164:02.12]Birkin is the only fast food... One of the only with a vegetarian option.
[164:08.10]Well, that doesn't mean I have to like it.
[164:12.60]All the other shit can suck.
[164:26.18]Oh, there he was.
[164:26.62]He just went in.
[164:27.30]Okay, we're good.
[164:33.49]I will say the Burger King long chicken is an A or S tier item.
[164:37.22]It's amazing.
[164:42.71]They do impossible burgers at Burger King, don't they?
[164:44.95]Is that what you're talking about?
[164:47.21]Do they still do that?
[164:49.39]Is that even still a thing?
[164:50.64]Can you still even eat impossible food stuff?
[165:01.53]Watch out for the crab!
[165:04.03]Look out!
[165:04.59]Fuck out!
[165:06.27]Crabs!
[165:17.28]I'm ready.
[165:20.75]A&W veggie burger slaps.
[165:31.50]You know, I've had a bunch of times that I really like a lot.
[165:33.85]I'm not vegetarian or vegan or anything.
[165:35.27]I'm not.
[165:37.87]But I've had a few black bean burgers.
[165:42.82]And they were, whoa, they were very good.
[165:53.73]A nice black bean burger actually goes very hard.
[166:05.85]What about a chickpea burger?
[166:06.90]I actually don't think I've ever had it before.
[166:17.01]Non-meats are best when they aren't trying to mimic meat.
[166:20.50]Yeah, I actually would prefer the flavor profile, and that's actually true.
[166:25.43]They make those big-ass mushroom burgers, don't they?
[166:28.43]There's a huge mushroom that isn't... Oh, look, it tastes like beef.
[166:33.70]No, it's just good on its own.
[166:42.69]Portobello, yeah.
[166:43.59]No, it's great.
[166:44.09]It's actually really good.
[166:46.38]As long as you go into it thinking, like, hey, this is not a regular beef hamburger.
[166:51.29]It's something else.
[166:56.22]I agree.
[166:56.56]The mimic beef thing is... I think if we just tell people, hey, man, like, this is not beef or ground beef.
[167:04.13]It still tastes kind of good, though.
[167:06.03]It's not like, hey, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[167:08.26]Eat this.
[167:08.72]We're faking you out.
[167:10.70]No, it's just good.
[167:12.14]Do you like something that tastes good?
[167:13.42]Here it is.
[167:19.15]It's almost like he recognized me.
[167:35.88]Somehow.
[167:37.94]Like, wait a minute.
[167:38.67]Wait, I know you.
[167:41.77]Hold up, were you down here last week?
[167:43.93]I feel like I saw you.
[167:44.82]Wait, you know Tim, right?
[167:47.29]This one's mine, actually.
[167:59.99]I lost him.
[168:04.05]Remember, I'm a mage.
[168:08.98]This weapon is pretty cool, though.
[168:19.48]I like all foods, okay?
[168:23.81]Actually, that's not true.
[168:27.36]What are some foods that I genuinely despise that I don't really like at all and I don't get it?
[168:33.73]I'll be honest.
[168:36.34]I have to be very, very honest.
[168:38.55]I don't get most sushi.
[168:42.72]I just kind of don't get it.
[168:44.78]There's some that I like.
[168:45.88]I've had a Philadelphia roll, for instance.
[168:48.00]I've had the raw salmon.
[168:48.89]I've had spicy tuna rolls.
[168:51.33]Those are good.
[168:52.47]Those are fine.
[168:52.99]But I just, I don't know.
[168:54.41]I just don't get it.
[168:55.67]Most of it.
[168:59.30]This one's mine.
[169:08.32]I will take a bite.
[169:09.18]Somebody be like, oh man, you got to try this.
[169:10.48]It's, um, yellow tail or something.
[169:12.93]It's looking, it's on the rice and oh, you dipped in the soy sauce.
[169:15.53]And I will, I'll humor it and I'll get it down and I'll be like, that's it.
[169:18.68]That was good.
[169:19.86]That was okay.
[169:21.42]I probably won't ever order that ever in my whole life ever.
[169:27.19]Not in my whole life.
[169:29.41]Spicy tuna roll?
[169:32.35]Sure thing.
[169:35.20]Sounds great.
[169:36.50]Says the McDonald's fan.
[169:37.88]I just told you.
[169:39.08]I eat pretty much everything.
[169:41.41]Yeah, I like McDonald's.
[169:44.89]I think it tastes good.
[169:46.21]Okay.
[169:47.55]I like the Burger King long chicken.
[169:49.12]I like spicy tuna rolls.
[169:51.70]I like... I like tikka masala.
[169:55.25]I love chicken sandwiches.
[169:57.19]I love, I like, I love all, I love pretzels.
[170:01.00]I love butter chicken.
[170:03.20]I love black bean burgers.
[170:06.36]You, that like, hey, you like McDonald's doesn't work.
[170:10.63]If, okay, if I turn my webcam on and there was like 40 bags of McDonald's crumpled up behind me and I've eaten it every day for the last like three years, then I would get really defensive like I am now.
[170:28.48]I had, you know what?
[170:29.46]I haven't had McDonald's.
[170:30.40]I've had McDonald's maybe eight months ago.
[170:36.31]Does that make me a fan?
[170:37.41]Okay.
[170:37.53]If you've only watched one baseball game in eight months, are you like a big fan or do you just like, Hey, that's like something that I'd like to watch sometimes.
[170:54.11]It's not that I don't want to have McDonald's, it's just I haven't had it because I got kind of sick last year.
[170:59.72]Felt like shit for a while.
[171:01.64]I just didn't really eat it and I haven't eaten it.
[171:09.13]He dresses as Ronald McDonald in his spare time.
[171:11.69]What a cool fucking mascot.
[171:14.34]That they relegated to just print magazines.
[171:18.58]And they turned every McDonald's into a fucking coffee shop.
[171:23.35]It's just, the Ronald McDonald, that was fucking awesome.
[171:26.96]And all the McDonald's now, they're like, cafe.
[171:29.58]Look at it, it's like that sleek marble, and it's, every fucking McDonald's is the same.
[171:36.75]No, bring back the cartoon characters, I don't give a fuck.
[171:41.77]And like, market it to adults.
[171:44.15]Do you know what I'm saying?
[171:45.92]Like, have Ronald McDonald...
[171:49.29]Have Ronald McDonald work it?
[171:50.47]I don't know.
[171:51.25]How do you make Ronald McDonald be like a grown-up?
[171:53.81]He is a grown-up.
[171:54.84]Get out of here.
[172:01.14]They had the whole Grimace Shake thing, and people remember that?
[172:03.48]It was like, I drank the Grimace Shake.
[172:06.39]They did that.
[172:10.17]Well, they didn't do it, but other people did.
[172:11.73]That wasn't an official ad from McDonald's.
[172:17.50]I'm just saying.
[172:19.29]they keep grimace around why I know I know people want me to move on but just wait why is grimace the only character they've kept around they've given him tons of grimace has his own baseball team grimace owns like a bunch of stock and stuff you see him with the hat on he's like oh hey yeah here's what I've been doing financing he's playing soccer he's running around he's got his own milkshake he's dancing where's where's Ronald McDonald where's the fry kids
[172:54.02]It's cause kids are scared of clowns.
[172:59.41]I don't... I... Well then let's stop making clowns wicked scary!
[173:03.36]I'm this clown that kills you!
[173:07.87]Yes, the scary murder clown!
[173:10.37]I want to stop doing that!
[173:13.01]Make them make balloon animals and laugh and stuff!
[173:22.29]That's the Joker.
[173:23.01]The Joker's scary.
[173:25.81]Pennywise is scary.
[173:28.17]That new clown is scary.
[173:29.70]The one that people puke in the movie theater and they leave.
[173:31.96]Imagine puking in the movie theater.
[173:34.72]Can you imagine puking in a movie theater?
[173:36.97]Because of watching a horror movie.
[173:40.65]Every time I hear about this movie, I think about, oh, and remember, guys, somebody puked in the theater.
[173:45.40]I was just like, what the fuck?
[173:47.54]Who's puking?
[173:48.18]You're just sitting there watching a movie and you just throw up?
[173:53.59]That's fucking crazy.
[174:01.74]I've never seen a movie in my life or never like seen a piece of media where I was just like, oh, puke.
[174:08.99]That seems fucking, that seems insane to me.
[174:16.80]I imagine running out of the seat and running down the hall and just like puking into your hand.
[174:21.24]Holy shit, man.
[174:32.15]That's too, that's intense.
[174:33.81]That is, and I don't know, that seems like a horror movie should not... How did we get here?
[174:42.74]I don't know, somebody said, look, you have McDonald's in your room.
[174:46.51]And I freaked out.
[174:51.51]And that, think about if you puked in the movie theater, with all the people you're with, what happens then?
[174:56.24]If you just get, if you puke down on the seat everywhere, like, is it just like, okay, we have to go home now?
[175:01.70]Do we all leave?
[175:04.32]Or is it like, I don't care, man.
[175:05.34]I paid for this ticket.
[175:06.13]I don't care if you puked here.
[175:06.93]I'm watching.
[175:07.49]It's going to be awful, but I'm going to watch this.
[175:12.73]Just move.
[175:15.94]Why is it implying that I'm not moving?
[175:17.70]I'm looking at there's a dark.
[175:19.26]Okay, hold on.
[175:20.29]It's dark in a movie theater.
[175:22.57]If I'm sitting right next to you and it's pitch black in the movie theater and we're watching the screen, I'm not going to get out of the way of you throwing up on me.
[175:30.54]I don't even know you're doing that.
[175:33.51]Right now, I see him running.
[175:34.73]He's chasing somebody down a hallway with a chainsaw.
[175:36.73]I'm not going to be like, oh, what happened over here?
[175:38.42]Are you good?
[175:39.58]If that's going to happen, you're probably just going to puke.
[175:43.42]And what about you?
[175:43.91]We dive out of the way where those seats?
[175:46.57]It's hard to even get up and move around in the first place.
[175:54.62]They make a noise?
[175:55.74]Not every time, what are you talking about?
[175:59.84]You need to mcdive out of the way.
[176:02.07]That has nothing to do with McDonald's.
[176:06.55]Sounds like you're going to blame me for puking in your car from motion sickness.
[176:10.32]We are talking about going to watch a horror movie where people are getting like chopped up in chainsaws and puking in the movie theater.
[176:17.16]This is different than, that's a physical thing.
[176:24.86]Alright, what is going on with this guy?
[176:28.77]You probably would continue eating your popcorn after somebody pukes on you.
[176:31.37]No, my God, I am such a clean freak.
[176:33.09]No way.
[176:34.96]I am going, I'm going to go up to the front desk and be like, hey, can I, I don't want a refund, but what is, is that movie playing in a different part of the movie theater?
[176:42.65]I want to go in the different theater and watch it.
[176:54.64]He said he'll go meet the cultists and you cover him up the stairs.
[177:01.70]No, I'll... No, this is my thing.
[177:04.79]I'm doing it.
[177:05.61]No, it's me, actually.
[177:11.26]Besides, I've trained for this kind of thing my whole life.
[177:13.87]I got all the books.
[177:15.17]No.
[177:16.25]It's me.
[177:16.73]Very well.
[177:17.17]We'll do it your way.
[177:18.37]Be careful and remember, we can't leave you without that book.
[177:21.48]I am the main character.
[177:22.48]It's our best chance of getting the amulet back.
[177:28.00]Listen, I may not survive this, but if I don't, you must.
[177:34.13]Okay.
[177:34.25]You must recover the book.
[177:35.53]You must recover the book and find the amulet of kings.
[177:44.12]Okay, don't worry.
[177:49.03]I never fail.
[177:50.29]Let's do this.
[177:53.73]It's time to sneak.
[177:59.58]Okay.
[178:09.03]Is he actually mad?
[178:14.90]There are no guards down here.
[178:23.67]Did I break them?
[178:25.30]Is it going to be for the rest of the game?
[178:34.61]Oh, I got to go
[178:45.68]Okay, here we go.
[178:55.99]Imagine looking down and seeing this weirdo down here.
[179:09.13]Give me the book.
[179:13.24]Got it.
[179:17.81]Got it.
[179:18.35]Let's go.
[179:19.65]What the fuck is he doing?
[179:23.38]Is he a double agent?
[179:27.28]What the fuck just happened?
[179:28.40]Why is he doing that?
[179:32.51]Oh, shit.
[179:33.17]The cultists.
[179:35.85]Ah!
[179:50.04]Okay, let me assess what's going on here.
[180:06.79]What happened?
[180:10.29]You just broke everything.
[180:14.48]It's because you pickpocketed him.
[180:16.30]Oh.
[180:17.18]Okay.
[180:17.98]Well, I got a break.
[180:19.16]I'm taking.
[180:19.54]We'll figure out what we're going to do.
[180:22.07]Am I softlocked for the whole game?
[180:24.95]What the fuck happened?
[180:25.83]Wait.
[180:26.57]I was just picking up random stuff.
[180:28.21]You freaked... You puked on him.
[180:32.44]What the hell?
[180:34.32]We both came to this movie.
[180:35.46]We both knew what we were getting into.
[180:38.19]Why did you come to the movie if you're a puker?
[180:41.41]By the way, before I go to break, if you're a puker, you're not all coming over to my house and watching a horror movie.
[180:46.79]No, that is not happening.
[180:48.92]If you're a movie puker, don't come over for a horror movie night.
[180:53.62]You are not coming over.
[180:55.72]No.
[180:56.46]You can come over when we watch Angels in the Outfield, okay?
[181:01.47]When I say I'm going to put that one on.
[181:04.73]Movie puker?
[181:05.73]Nope.
[181:06.11]You're not invited to the movie.
[181:10.48]I don't want you to get up and just run to the bathroom and puke.
[181:12.77]No, sorry.
[181:13.75]You can get invited up when we watch the PG and PG-13 stuff.
[181:20.02]What if you puke from angels in the outfield?
[181:22.54]Then I don't know what to tell you.
[181:29.98]Alright, I'll be right back.
[181:30.80]We'll figure out what we're going to do.
[181:33.66]He attacked me.
[181:34.58]All I did was I took like five coins out of his pocket.
[181:38.60]and the stuff and a few other things but we're not it's okay I'll be back
[185:07.27]you
[186:49.25]How's it going?
[186:53.80]I just keep laughing.
[186:54.80]I've been laughing since I took a break.
[186:57.62]I just keep thinking about this whole scenario.
[186:58.88]Like, why?
[186:59.26]I took a bunch of coins.
[187:01.79]We're just, oh yeah, we're going to do this together.
[187:03.35]Let's go.
[187:04.39]You and me, let's go stop the cultists.
[187:07.53]Oh, get behind me.
[187:09.13]And I just reach in his back pocket and just pull up whatever's in there.
[187:12.12]And he's like, hey, don't do that.
[187:14.70]And then he attacks me later and I kill him.
[187:17.77]Like, why did he not attack me immediately if he was going to attack me?
[187:22.19]I just, like, ripped everything out of his back pocket.
[187:26.22]And the dude just goes, help!
[187:28.16]And then, no, we're good.
[187:29.48]Alright, let me go do this.
[187:31.29]I go get the book, he comes down, and I kill him.
[187:33.55]I feel like I have to live with this.
[187:34.85]I don't know if I want to load this.
[187:36.09]It's too canon for me right now.
[187:49.70]You fucked the whole thing up.
[187:53.46]Alright, what do you think?
[187:54.84]We'll put it to a vote.
[187:55.57]Is it, uh, do I live with this or do I reload and do it correctly?
[187:59.89]You'll just miss out on some free skill points, but it's not game over.
[188:02.42]Okay.
[188:05.30]Let's do, let's do, put it to a poll.
[188:07.45]I'll leave it in your guys' hands.
[188:17.35]Am I going back and doing it or are we living with what just happened?
[188:21.52]I wouldn't have killed him if he didn't attack me first.
[188:24.63]I just stole stuff from him.
[188:30.86]Holy shit, this is 50-50.
[188:33.62]Wow.
[188:37.53]You not only ruined your playthrough, but mine as well.
[188:40.08]Are you just mimicking everything I'm doing?
[188:53.15]Oh man, this is this might be too close to call.
[188:56.23]Yeah, you gotta get.
[188:56.83]We might have to do it again.
[188:58.87]This is straight up 5050.
[189:00.17]You gotta do it now.
[189:01.22]Vote now.
[189:01.92]This is a big deal.
[189:02.76]If you're in another tab, this is huge.
[189:05.12]This is actually a massive vote right now.
[189:07.24]This could change everything.
[189:09.02]Vote now.
[189:09.66]This could change everything.
[189:14.83]OK.
[189:16.35]Wow by less than 10 votes.
[189:20.40]Holy shit.
[189:22.98]That's unbelievable.
[189:30.19]Holy smokes.
[189:32.64]Alright, well.
[189:34.66]Why would they want to change it?
[189:35.62]Why would you want to change it?
[189:37.07]Now people are going to be mad.
[189:39.33]That's alright.
[189:40.87]We got to do the fun thing.
[189:41.82]It was funny.
[189:43.44]Now I get my skill points.
[189:46.07]Do a recount.
[189:46.73]That's fraud.
[189:47.77]Recount.
[189:48.93]You know, just for the sake of it, do a recount.
[189:50.79]I'm curious.
[189:52.43]We're going to do reroll, but I'm curious.
[190:02.13]Let's do a recount.
[190:12.84]Why would you even give me the opportunity to pickpocket him?
[190:23.38]So all the people saying that it's a reroll.
[190:25.00]Yes, I did.
[190:25.88]I did reload it.
[190:28.32]To do a way worse outcome.
[190:37.96]Wait, what?
[190:48.91]Skip.
[190:52.35]Why can he not die now?
[191:00.16]Bro, reload is winning by way more now.
[191:02.24]Okay.
[191:05.63]He's an essential Andy.
[191:07.63]Apparently not.
[191:12.82]Alright, let's go.
[191:29.58]What the fuck are you doing?
[191:35.01]Why is he messing up my playthrough now?
[191:38.15]He's messing up my playthrough.
[191:54.32]He took that right in the side of the dome.
[192:04.79]That was cruel.
[192:11.92]What the hell was that?
[192:12.75]I didn't do anything!
[192:14.17]Where the hell am I?
[192:28.00]No, what actually is going on?
[192:33.12]Talk to him.
[192:34.31]I was waiting for him to sit down.
[192:41.89]He doesn't have a seat.
[192:50.12]Hi.
[192:51.21]Guys.
[192:51.57]I... I'm mad at the chat now.
[192:55.47]Don't do it.
[192:56.97]I'm sitting right now.
[193:10.43]I'm sitting!
[193:15.38]What are they doing?
[193:22.74]No, you idiots!
[193:24.76]Stop!
[193:34.74]Stand ready.
[193:44.91]Okay, we're done.
[193:51.41]That's three more that won't be reporting back to the master.
[193:54.00]Good job.
[193:56.98]Get the book.
[194:00.10]Give me the money.
[194:01.46]Holy shit.
[194:03.51]This is three thousand two.
[194:05.59]Shh, don't.
[194:06.37]Three thousand two hundred is how much a car weighs.
[194:14.04]Did you know that?
[194:15.64]Boris, that's crazy.
[194:17.04]They weigh two, three thousand pounds.
[194:26.95]insane I didn't I thought they were with one thousand now what now that you have all four books you should be able to handle things from here I'm going to cloud ruler temple my place is at Martin's side okay bye I'll see you back at cloud ruler temple good luck
[195:01.75]I love how he just kind of let... Is there a... Does that guy have a bedroom?
[195:06.84]What are they... Okay, how do you operate down here?
[195:08.91]Why would anyone be down here?
[195:12.50]Why would your secret lair be down here?
[195:13.86]There's no bed... Are there beds?
[195:15.15]There are beds.
[195:15.75]Okay, so you have a bed...
[195:32.71]It's to sneak around.
[195:35.28]If the entire sewer is covered in this stuff, it's not that sneaky.
[196:02.23]Not the entire sewer.
[196:04.57]No, it's just in the front door of the sewer.
[196:11.37]It just works.
[196:32.10]Oblivion awaits you.
[196:36.14]Oblivion.
[196:38.40]Holy.
[196:54.52]I'm just going to clear this whole thing.
[196:55.68]Why not?
[196:56.14]Or at least most of it.
[197:10.66]End of the tunnel.
[197:22.90]Nope.
[197:31.11]So Skyrim is set, what, four or five thousand years in the future?
[197:35.07]After Oblivion, right?
[197:36.58]Or ten thousand years?
[197:42.08]Because that's like all the cars and all the pop culture stuff in it.
[197:47.68]Thomas the Tank Engine and like X-Men and stuff.
[197:55.77]Like 10?
[197:56.57]Oh.
[198:00.79]Oh, okay.
[198:07.66]Don't more people play Skyrim still than half of all the video games ever made?
[198:13.80]Aren't more people playing Skyrim than this right now?
[198:37.49]Broke cut.
[198:47.55]Karma's got more mods.
[198:54.90]And it's got that song too that everybody loves.
[199:22.01]I love when the big band comes in.
[199:32.41]How does that do?
[199:46.87]I have to tell you guys that when I was younger, somebody asked me.
[199:53.16]They were like, oh man, I forget who the artist is or whatever.
[199:55.98]I don't remember.
[199:57.57]But that song, Return of the Mack, I've told this story before.
[200:01.07]I know I have.
[200:02.62]One of my classmates got the album or something and was like, oh man, have you heard the song?
[200:09.99]Oh, it's awesome.
[200:10.71]Return of the Mack.
[200:11.17]Have you heard it?
[200:13.01]I was like, oh yeah!
[200:13.99]And I never have.
[200:14.65]And I didn't.
[200:15.23]I didn't know what it was.
[200:17.25]And in my young kid brain, I thought that if I just made up what the song sounded like, that I heard it.
[200:30.67]He's like, yeah, I love it.
[200:31.47]I was like, oh yeah, I love that song.
[200:32.67]It's so good.
[200:33.09]And he's like, yeah, yeah.
[200:34.47]And I started singing it.
[200:36.72]And I thought it was, I put my hands down like I was playing an electric guitar.
[200:41.58]And I was going like, it's the return of the Mac.
[200:47.47]It's the return of the Mac.
[200:50.23]And I guess I got it close enough where I didn't get called out on it.
[200:54.48]Cause that was, that was kind of close enough, but he probably was like, why the fuck is this kid doing an electric guitar?
[201:06.65]It's because he hadn't heard it either.
[201:08.58]Interesting take.
[201:11.06]Because that might actually be real.
[201:17.23]You passed the D20 roll.
[201:19.03]It felt like it, yeah.
[201:20.67]Or was he just making kind of like, oh yeah, yeah!
[201:24.68]Because he didn't hear it at all.
[201:28.92]I thought genuinely that you were homeschooled.
[201:31.37]Why would you ever think that?
[201:32.29]I went to public school.
[201:38.66]Fucking homeschooled.
[201:39.80]The fuck are you talking about?
[201:53.02]You got steak for lunch?
[201:55.74]I mean, I got steakums for lunch.
[201:57.86]That was on the menu sometimes.
[202:00.88]They would come up with big trays of steakums and they would put them in sub rolls.
[202:06.87]One time I ate four of them in one sitting.
[202:16.03]You had steak at a private school.
[202:18.75]What?
[202:19.06]No.
[202:19.54]What?
[202:20.20]What are you talking about?
[202:22.75]I'm walking in circles.
[202:23.67]Hold on.
[202:23.89]How do I get out of here?
[202:26.64]Steak for lunch.
[202:35.99]like what like once a month on a Thursday we would have steakums I would just get him essentially what I would do is that what was for lunch all the time I would have the pizza in the box there was a white square box and there was a square pizza in it and that was sometimes I was out on every other Friday
[203:03.82]It was a little white rectangle box like square.
[203:11.63]Did you have pancakes?
[203:12.59]No, never.
[203:15.47]Chatters think that steakums are rich.
[203:19.72]Um.
[203:21.62]I actually haven't had it in a long time, but that stuff I don't.
[203:25.86]I don't look down on that shit.
[203:28.13]I like that stuff actually.
[203:33.84]Alright, what the hell am I doing?
[203:43.29]That's not how to open this.
[203:56.68]Oh, what the fuck dude?
[204:09.43]Get out of the way.
[204:12.29]Are you going in circles endlessly?
[204:14.15]Because I'm looking over at chat and talking to you guys and not playing the game.
[204:31.86]I got it.
[204:32.16]I'm out.
[204:32.72]I'm out.
[204:36.36]Exit to this person's basement?
[204:41.37]I'm gonna come up like a ninja turtle and I'm gonna come up to somebody's toilet?
[205:19.59]Uh oh.
[205:39.44]Just checking in case anything crazy.
[205:42.83]I am trespassing, so let's make it quick.
[205:56.99]Amantius Alectus' house.
[206:01.85]Probably sleeping, right?
[206:22.83]I think I'm safe.
[206:36.88]Get reverse tooth buried.
[206:49.20]Yeah, I'm just going to leave a bunch of teeth.
[206:54.30]Do I have goblin teeth or ogre teeth or something?
[207:07.95]I don't think I do.
[207:25.85]Leave a garlic?
[207:49.07]Just leaving all my junk here.
[208:02.77]Did I leave a pair of pants?
[208:11.98]Well, I gave them extra plates.
[208:16.26]What else you got?
[208:18.69]take it I'm playing with fire here but whatever
[208:55.74]It's going to scare the shit out of them.
[209:17.46]For the love of Azura, can't a man have a bit of privacy?
[209:21.03]Get out of here.
[209:22.03]Sure.
[209:22.81]Sorry.
[209:23.61]I think someone is watching me.
[209:25.57]I see figures in the shadows all the time.
[209:28.66]I know it's all in my head.
[209:31.20]I'm spending too much time on my latest project.
[209:33.75]But enough about me.
[209:35.09]What can I do for you?
[209:36.11]Who are you?
[209:38.79]Do you know where this person is?
[209:40.01]Oh, he's that wanted criminal.
[209:43.08]Isn't he a master thief?
[209:45.04]I hear he's dangerous, too.
[209:46.94]Interesting.
[209:48.16]Okay, what about this person?
[209:53.31]Hmm.
[209:54.01]Okay, well... Uh...
[210:11.98]I took a bunch of your teeth, uh, downstairs, so I have to do, I have to leave you some money.
[210:17.85]So, um, you get it.
[210:21.34]You both sleep in this bed at the same time?
[210:27.93]How?
[210:28.67]What?
[210:32.54]How do you sleep in this bed together?
[210:33.94]Okay, okay, okay, okay, hey, hey!
[210:43.24]What do you mean I need to get out?
[211:07.70]Cool.
[211:08.22]Alright.
[211:08.48]So I got everything.
[211:09.54]I got all the books.
[211:12.12]I'm ready to mess around.
[211:22.64]A little bit of shpee.
[211:26.01]A little bit of shpee.
[211:40.18]Oh, I love that so much.
[211:41.23]That's like one of my favorite things ever.
[211:46.55]There's so many reasons why I like that.
[211:49.32]Just can't even count them all.
[211:53.59]Are you two Alexas done talking to each other?
[212:14.26]Can we have a real conversation now?
[212:16.97]A pleasure to speak with you.
[212:20.32]I got the books.
[212:21.60]To find their secret shrine to Mehrunes Dagon, you'll need to study the four volumes.
[212:27.87]It is a fairly comp... You've piqued my curiosity about this puzzle.
[212:33.79]Check back with me tomorrow after I've... Oh, I thought she was giving me just horseshit.
[212:38.84]I'll keep studying the first two volumes of the commentaries.
[212:42.58]Who knows?
[212:43.42]I might turn up something before you do.
[212:46.01]I'll read them faster than you.
[212:55.55]Okay Red drink, razor-fed, I had glimpsed the path into the garden, okay

[214:10.30]No, I do that to people, not you.
[214:11.81]I walk by and do all like, I don't want you doing that.
[214:23.20]Oh, I'm not allowed.
[214:23.80]I can't wait to go in here.
[214:25.74]Alright, I'll come back tomorrow.
[214:28.74]We're going to sleep in it.
[214:35.20]I'll go to the inn.
[214:43.45]Reheating your nachos?
[214:50.88]Oh, dollhouse!
[214:54.50]Remixed!
[215:02.61]That'd be awful.
[215:05.46]What is it, citizen?
[215:16.13]I need the market district, right?
[215:24.00]You have my ear, citizen.
[215:29.47]Where even is it?
[215:34.05]What is fast travel?
[215:34.90]Can I...
[215:41.55]Yeah, I would never want to do another dollhouse unless it was... There's no way that would ever happen.
[215:47.18]I mean, it's not going to happen, but if we were talking hypotheticals... No.
[216:03.46]No, the act of dilution is something I don't like.
[216:06.08]I don't want to dilute it.
[216:09.65]Unless it was a completely different, and I've thought about it, maybe a completely different idea.
[216:14.90]But you dilute it.
[216:16.36]I'm not diluting it.
[216:17.99]What about shpee?
[216:21.01]Yeah, I did that like five, ten times.
[216:23.80]In 2012.
[216:28.80]I diluted the fuck out of it.
[216:29.93]And look, I don't want to do it anymore either.
[216:32.25]Look what happens when you dilute it.
[216:44.95]Can I not go in any of these?
[216:48.76]What is it citizen?
[216:52.26]Go take a break.
[216:56.05]The merchants in weary travelers come to merchants in.
[217:09.59]How are you?
[217:10.09]What do you want?
[217:11.43]Stop talking.
[217:14.59]You're four years sub.
[217:19.43]I'm not taking the bait on that one.
[217:22.95]Blasted thief.
[217:24.84]I hope they string him up when they catch him.
[217:27.66]He's a slippery one though.
[217:28.96]The beggars are his eyes and ears.
[217:31.32]Is there a single non-balding man in the city?
[217:34.87]I do have a... Kind of true though.
[217:38.59]Very good.
[217:39.39]It's up the stairs there.
[217:40.35]First door.
[217:41.85]Farewell.
[217:42.78]For a second I thought that was 200 gold and I was about to kill this guy.
[218:35.38]Whoa, what's this?
[218:36.82]I was... Don't be so unimportant.
[218:40.43]I was heartbroken when you rejected me.
[218:42.45]Tell me what I can do to win your heart.
[218:44.19]I will slay trolls, walk through thorns, fast for a week.
[218:47.78]Please don't shut me out of your life.
[218:49.22]I love you more than a flower needs sunshine.
[218:51.52]Go to the end of the street.
[218:55.93]Turn left.
[218:56.67]Take the next right.
[218:58.07]If you see the house with the fallen roof, you've gone too far.
[219:00.40]Knock twice.
[219:01.08]Pause.
[219:01.40]Knock again.
[219:01.90]They'll let you in.
[219:02.86]Be sure to have the money.
[219:06.72]Copious coin purse has goods from beyond the shores of Anvil.
[219:09.68]All manner of exotic items are available.
[219:11.02]We have the widest.
[219:17.25]I'll leave him one fork.
[219:30.49]I'll leave a fucking dump on his desk.
[219:42.39]Did I just eat that?
[219:43.34]No, I didn't want to eat it.
[219:44.72]I wanted to drop it.
[219:46.42]Oh boy.
[219:46.92]What happened?
[219:47.30]What does that mean?
[219:56.58]You just ate... Whoa!
[220:13.95]What is this?
[220:16.55]Can't wait to see you tonight.
[220:17.67]Why is this in my hotel room?
[220:19.20]My everyday is spent thinking about when we will be together.
[220:21.52]Soon we'll be married.
[220:24.30]Why is this in my hotel room?
[220:41.23]I paid for this room.
[220:41.97]I didn't break into this one.
[220:51.68]Okay.
[220:53.08]Now... Wait, I'll break into this one.
[221:01.71]There's weird notes everywhere.
[221:11.96]How did that... I can't believe you're doing all this.
[221:18.75]Look, okay, you go ahead and go drive by the rules of the road in GTA, okay?
[221:24.99]And don't do any crimes in GTA.
[221:29.02]Just do the missions and go only on green lights and stuff.
[221:42.44]Yeah, I open up your GTA log combat file and I see that you punched anybody on the sidewalk.
[221:49.31]You're a hypocrite.
[222:27.30]You don't have to do this.
[222:37.57]GTA 6.
[222:39.99]Is I don't know, it's.
[222:44.28]I feel like that week there could be.
[222:45.66]We could hit a new paradigm.
[222:46.92]You know what I mean?
[222:47.42]There could be a whole new world.
[222:49.71]Isn't I Devlin Norman?
[222:51.53]I have no idea what that's getting what that game is going to be like.
[222:54.21]It's going to be insane.
[223:00.79]Can't you make TikToks and stuff in it?
[223:03.94]It's going to be so stupid.
[223:05.18]I can't wait for it.
[223:06.26]It's going to be so goofy.
[223:08.81]It's going to be mid.
[223:10.25]Okay, the one thing I will say, I don't want to get excited for games because getting excited for anything these days feels like, oh, wow, you got excited for that.
[223:16.71]And it was fucking dog shit when it came out.
[223:20.22]I don't... Rockstar... GTA 4 was amazing.
[223:22.86]GTA 5 was amazing.
[223:23.96]I don't... Are they gonna drop the ball so hard in 6?
[223:29.31]I don't know.
[223:30.61]I don't think so.
[223:34.10]Are they going to fumble this?
[223:36.68]I don't know if they will.
[223:38.85]The track record of the last few have been great.
[223:41.63]I... It's one of my favorite series ever made.
[223:44.23]A lot of people can say that.
[223:46.16]I don't think they will.
[223:49.75]What is it, citizen?
[223:52.17]Well met.
[223:53.45]Now, I could eat those words a year from now, whatever, right?
[223:56.51]They delayed it again, didn't they?
[224:00.40]Yeah, Red Dead Redemption 2 is one of the best games of all time.
[224:02.90]That's... I don't know, guys.
[224:04.34]I think they have a... Maybe it'll be bad, but eventually good after a year.
[224:08.95]I don't know.
[224:12.29]Okay, where do I gotta go now?
[224:14.19]Oh, I gotta go back to... Where is she?
[224:16.13]She's over here.
[224:33.28]A billion dollars in the first month, calling it.
[224:36.25]I mean, maybe.
[224:37.37]I don't know.
[224:44.42]I will say, if GTA 6 is bad, like, whoa, this is not good at all, that might signal a massive top in the industry.
[224:54.39]And I'm talking like a generational top.
[224:57.71]If GTA 6 sucks, that's a generational top.
[225:02.12]because that's not good news.
[225:11.86]If it's bad, there'll probably be a crash.
[225:14.68]Yeah, that sucks.
[225:17.47]It does because there's a lot of people that's put a lot of time into a lot of this stuff.
[225:21.09]A lot of these game companies, you know, like hundreds of people making this stuff.
[225:24.77]You know, you don't want to see that, right?
[225:27.10]You really just don't.
[225:28.56]But I do think that a GTA 6 flop would not be good for the industry.
[225:36.35]It would be very bad.
[225:40.33]How are you?
[225:41.69]Good day.
[225:44.03]Go back to indie thriving.
[225:45.80]I think some of the indie games that have come out have been better than most of the stuff that's come out in the last five to ten years.
[225:52.70]To find their secret, it is in effect.
[225:56.23]You've peaked.
[225:57.39]Check back with me tomorrow.
[225:58.99]It's not tomorrow?
[226:00.01]Did I pay 20 bucks to go sleep for four hours?
[226:02.44]What time is it?
[226:05.18]What did I do?
[226:06.38]I slept.
[226:06.92]It's the same day.
[226:08.39]What the fuck is going on with me?
[226:16.22]That room is still mine, right?
[226:17.46]I don't have to pay for another room.
[226:18.52]It's mine still.
[226:19.27]Same day.
[226:30.46]I can wait?
[226:31.02]I thought I couldn't wait because doesn't that not count as it actually... It does count, okay.
[226:57.92]You watch the night rain streams yesterday?
[226:59.56]I did not.
[227:03.63]I'll catch up on a lot of the night rain stuff early this week, but I'm not going to be playing it at launch.
[227:07.77]I'll be playing it a few days later.
[227:19.57]I imagine probably Ster and.
[227:21.25]Maybe some of the horseman will probably be playing it.
[227:24.96]Which I'm sure that'd be great content if it happens.
[227:28.80]But I will not be around until a couple days after it releases.
[227:51.31]How did I end up in this random bald guy's room like that?
[227:54.70]How did I end up here?
[227:56.38]Where am I?
[228:03.53]Okay, pay attention time.
[228:07.46]Eyes on the road.
[228:12.09]Different circular room.
[228:20.05]Speak.
[228:27.80]How are you?
[228:29.16]Hey, there we go.
[228:31.80]So what did you figure out?
[228:37.39]Here we go.
[228:42.51]Main car Cameron certainly is a fascinating writer.
[228:46.19]Undoubtedly insane, but fascinating.
[228:50.32]Ah, but more to the point, it appears to me that the first words of each paragraph may be significant.
[228:57.40]A message may be in there.
[229:00.09]I'll continue to study the problem.
[229:03.55]OK, the first words of each paragraph are the key.
[229:07.65]Alright, so paragraph one.
[229:10.70]Episode one.
[229:16.14]readings reader enter readings reader enter every night enter readings reader enter every night enter my palace endlessly roaring offering red
[229:45.19]That don't make any sense.
[229:54.24]Whoever answers your whisper hides enraptured, recorded, enslaved.
[230:06.71]The Oathbreakers woe every reader that once understood
[230:14.90]him, he and death Starlight.
[230:25.38]May I deathlessly deny all your sons under nothing.
[230:36.63]I'm sure of it.
[230:48.70]You would definitely homeschooled being that person.
[230:51.34]Forever.
[230:56.55]Homeschooled.
[231:05.60]I'm back and I've learned many things.
[231:09.84]I think I may have figured out the hidden message in Mankar Cameron's books.
[231:14.35]Do you have the third and fourth volumes with you?
[231:19.13]Yeah.
[231:20.07]Excellent.
[231:20.95]Let's see.
[231:21.63]Yes.
[231:22.43]The first letter of each paragraph spells out a message.
[231:25.94]I did that.
[231:26.86]Write this down.
[231:28.26]Green Emperor Way where tower touches midday sun.
[231:32.09]That's what I got too.
[231:32.91]That's what I had on my notes.
[231:33.93]Are you familiar with Green Emperor Way?
[231:36.43]The gardens around the Imperial Palace.
[231:38.97]Something must be revealed there at noon.
[231:42.34]How exciting.
[231:44.98]Cool.
[231:47.21]I've half a mind to go down to Green Emperor Way myself and see what's there.
[231:52.03]Well, you must find Jim.
[232:08.75]Alright, so we figured it out.
[232:11.56]Green Emperor Way, where it touches midday.
[232:21.23]you dress like me good to see you my name is heger I don't get out much too many books to read take care speak pretty books
[232:53.46]I don't think you can read every book that's been published since 2010.
[232:59.01]How sad is that?
[233:06.29]You will never be able to read even the books that were published in the last five years if you read them all in a row.
[233:15.48]How sad is that?
[233:32.22]Alright, it's gotta be noon.
[233:41.75]Turn this on?
[233:42.45]Activated?
[233:49.62]Okay.
[233:53.13]Let's go.
[233:53.57]I got it.
[233:57.45]It's over here.
[234:08.49]Alright, would you rather read every single book that has come out since 2015 or watch every single TV show that's come out since 2015?
[234:16.72]TV show.
[234:24.33]I don't know.
[234:27.15]That's a tough one, kind of.
[234:29.03]I feel like there's been a lot of stinkers that have released in the last 10 years that are long.
[234:34.18]By the way, I am also talking about non-fiction.
[234:37.92]So...
[234:40.14]That's a lot.
[234:44.27]Think about everything that's come out on the History Channel in the last like 10 years.
[234:48.29]That's interesting, but that's a lot of time.
[235:02.19]In the world or in the United States?
[235:03.93]In the world.
[235:06.22]all television ever in the last 10 years and you have to do it in a row or read all books that have released in the last 10 years and yes you have to translate the books if you don't speak the language well that sucks never mind just the just the United States
[235:45.91]Even the smut.
[235:50.05]Wait, that doesn't... Hold on.
[235:52.58]Hold on a second.
[235:53.54]No, I don't think that means... Ah, there's... I'm talking like on television.
[236:02.15]On TV.
[236:04.54]But books are a little different, aren't they?
[236:08.73]Um...
[236:26.46]There are zesty TV shows.
[236:43.28]Actually, kind of a big percentage of people would rather do the books.
[236:46.53]I feel like the books would take longer.
[236:48.67]I think I would pick TV.
[236:50.43]The books would take too long.
[236:51.84]I don't even know if you could even do it.
[237:04.17]Hundreds of years.
[237:06.61]Yeah, but I forgot to say that you get immortality.
[237:10.54]Your reward for doing this is you become immortal.
[237:14.52]But you have to do it in a row.
[237:22.85]So you blended in with the background.
[237:26.11]All I saw was the things on his neck.
[237:31.39]Welcome, brother.
[237:32.69]The hour is late, but the Master still has need for willing hands.
[237:37.64]You may pass into the shrine.
[237:40.28]Harrow will take you to the Master for your initiation into the service of Lord Dagon.
[237:46.49]Do not tarry.
[237:47.63]The time of preparation is almost over.
[237:50.19]The time of cleansing is near.
[237:52.43]It's gonna be crazy.
[237:57.06]Harrow awaits within.
[237:58.28]You should not linger here.
[238:00.82]Okay, I won't.
[238:09.61]I got the key.
[238:21.65]I am Harrow, Warden of the Shrine of Dagon.
[238:25.93]By following the path of Dawn hidden in the writings of the Master, Mankar Cameron, you have earned a place among the chosen.
[238:35.76]You have arrived at an opportune time.
[238:38.73]You may have the honor to be initiated into the Order by the Master himself.
[238:45.35]As a member of the Order of the Mythic Dawn, everything you need will be provided for you from the Master's bounty.
[238:53.07]give me your possessions and put on this initiate's robe give me all your possessions hold on a second but first of all um leather jacket I'm looking over a mod chat he said tons of textbooks on random yeah you'd have to you'd have to read every calculus book
[239:15.31]every history book every geometry you'd have to read every college textbook that sucks dick dude pick TV I'm telling you you just who cares what it is on that would be terrible that'd be awful imagine having to you would have to do every college course ever made in the last 10 years
[239:44.06]That's 10,000 years.
[239:44.96]Yeah, you get immortality, but I think the TV one would take a lot quicker.
[239:50.49]What about the news?
[239:51.25]Does the news count as TV?
[239:53.31]Oh, shit.
[239:53.91]That's bad, too.
[239:54.75]Yeah.
[239:55.76]You would have to watch every local... Oh, it's the Fox.
[240:00.38]Fox Seattle.
[240:01.40]You'd have to watch Fox Seattle.
[240:04.28]Every broadcast they've done in the last 10 years.
[240:06.63]For every city and every town in America.
[240:13.37]I don't know if that's worth your mortality.
[240:17.56]Is times two speed allowed?
[240:18.74]Absolutely not.
[240:19.95]You're getting immortality out of this.
[240:27.78]There are so many Minecraft books too.
[240:31.25]Just Minecraft alone would take a hundred years.
[240:36.64]What?
[240:40.75]the legend of Dave the villager book one to five Minecraft sticker adventure treasure hunt Minecraft where's the zombie there's a lot of these yeah this take a long time
[241:02.19]There are over a hundred thousand results just for the term self help books.
[241:06.40]You'd have to read every cookbook.
[241:09.00]No, this would be bad.
[241:10.81]I don't think I can pick one of these.
[241:12.11]TV would be, I don't want to watch every like NBC local fucking like Atlanta broadcast.
[241:19.16]I don't want to see every single like Vermont Fox broadcast, but I don't want to read a hundred thousand cookbooks.
[241:27.85]Oh boy.
[241:30.17]Alright, ponder on this while I take a break.
[241:31.89]I'll be back.
[241:48.70]Well, I'm still here.
[241:49.42]I need to laugh at this and just say it because it right right it's right now.
[241:52.02]Somebody said you have to watch every single episode of the view.
[241:56.02]okay how many that that is a lot because that's 10 that's been on for 10 years you'd have to watch every episode of like jeopardy of wheel of fortune family feud I mean that would be enjoyable but that's a lot reality every soap opera that's right hasn't general hospital been going for like 40 years straight and there's like 10 000 episodes
[242:23.72]Every single basketball game, every baseball game, every football game ever broadcast in the United States.
[242:29.99]In 10 years.
[242:35.00]Alright, beer break.
[243:05.47]Thank you.
[247:32.95]I love this the discussion is still going I love it
[248:04.73]You're not gonna force me to watch that pimple-popping TV show.
[248:09.23]I'm sorry.
[248:09.83]Then you have to read 400 books on calculus.
[248:21.63]Do ads count as TV?
[248:24.65]Uh, no.
[248:25.85]I will say no.
[248:28.43]Or actually... Is it how it was originally broadcast?
[248:33.30]That might be fine.
[248:41.35]What about reruns?
[248:43.85]No.
[248:45.91]Reruns are not included.
[248:47.42]So let's just say if you're talking about like Friends, for instance, you would just need to watch season one through eight of Friends, not the 10,000 of the times it's been on TV.
[249:02.48]What about newspapers?
[249:05.27]Newspapers I don't think qualify as a book.
[249:10.59]But a magazine might.
[249:16.24]So every you know.
[249:18.56]Hey look that BMX magazine.
[249:21.62]You gotta read them all.
[249:29.09]What about QVC?
[249:30.87]Yes.
[249:32.91]Which you should be really happy about.
[249:34.97]I'll give you a quick funny story about QVC.
[249:38.40]Right now there are.
[249:41.23]There are two things that I have recorded on my DVR.
[249:44.28]I don't know how this happened.
[249:46.18]I looked at my DVR recordings because, you know, I think it's like, oh, you can go look what you have recorded.
[249:51.07]I don't even use it.
[249:53.82]But one of the things that I have recorded is there is a program on QVC.
[250:02.90]that is about food.
[250:05.27]I forget what it's called.
[250:05.97]It's called like Meat and Be Merry or something.
[250:09.84]I don't know when it releases.
[250:10.78]I don't know what happened, but I said about seven or eight months ago to record every single time it's on and every time it ever is reran.
[250:21.04]I have 155 recordings of this one segment from QVC.
[250:27.46]And I started at one, and it is great.
[250:31.88]And I'm fucking going through the whole damn thing.
[250:34.25]I don't even care if it's old.
[250:36.39]The other one that I have is, I believe, 80 recordings of a prostate supplement infomercial.
[250:42.62]I don't know why.
[250:43.86]And then, 12 recordings of the game show, The Floor.
[250:56.19]That's it.
[250:57.07]That is what is on my DVR.
[251:03.42]I don't know why I have every... But it's not a different infomercial.
[251:07.41]It's the same infomercial.
[251:08.67]I don't know why I recorded it.
[251:13.06]I throw QVC on, man, all the time.
[251:14.92]I love QVC.
[251:16.22]It's like one of my favorite things.
[251:18.50]Oh, so what you got here is, take a look at this.
[251:21.33]These bagels, when I open this up, take a look at that.
[251:24.26]Those bagels are delicious.
[251:25.32]And they're going to come to you.
[251:27.67]And we got free shipping on this, by the way.
[251:30.26]And could you please tell us about these peanuts?
[251:33.30]I love QVC.
[251:36.64]QVC is a live infomercial.
[251:39.01]I love infomercials and it's a wonderful network.
[251:43.65]It's one of the best background sounds, background kind of stuff you could ever listen to.
[251:48.98]There's been stuff that I've just looked over.
[251:50.85]Holly and I watch it all the time.
[251:52.49]It will just be on and I'll go, damn, I kind of want that.
[251:57.74]I've never bought anything, but I go, I want that.
[252:00.24]I want it.
[252:01.80]I need to like fucking get it.
[252:04.99]That's insane behavior.
[252:06.05]No, it's not.
[252:07.95]It's entertainment.
[252:08.65]It's very entertaining.
[252:21.33]We need a QVC night.
[252:22.91]I don't think that's allowed.
[252:24.15]But I love infomercials.
[252:29.21]They're so funny.
[252:29.92]They're so just bizarre and...
[252:32.30]That's a live infomercial.
[252:35.44]Especially when they do the vacuum cleaners and in real time they put all the cereal and the dust on the ground and the host is trying to talk over the vacuum.
[252:49.53]Watch old ones.
[252:57.22]Host your own QVC night.
[252:59.28]You know, I've thought about this before, how I think that
[253:03.25]They would probably do... I'm just saying.
[253:07.41]I think that QVC would do really well on a live platform like Twitch.
[253:12.47]I think they would destroy it.
[253:15.10]It would be so good.
[253:18.38]I'm not talking like a one-time thing.
[253:19.68]I'm talking like they try it for a few months at least.
[253:28.51]I think it would be equally hilarious and I think it would be great.
[253:33.43]We would never hear from you ever again.
[253:40.30]They would get a lot of spam.
[253:41.64]But they would think of the calls.
[253:43.23]Imagine people could call in.
[253:44.57]Imagine like streamers could call in.
[253:46.81]Like, oh yeah, you know, I use this product.
[253:52.28]And it was wonderful, let me tell you.
[253:54.92]Those, the slippers are so comfortable.
[253:57.73]Yes, they are.
[253:58.80]Yes, they are.
[253:59.62]They are the most comfortable slippers I've ever had, and I'm so glad you had my size.
[254:03.72]That would be wonderful.
[254:09.13]You have too much faith in your fellow man.
[254:11.67]No streamers under 40 would care.
[254:19.62]There's still like eight of us.
[254:34.30]and with a chat too also what happened with the watching like movies with chat what the hell that would be so fun with the chat imagine being able to chat you know with the with the group the mca well I'm talking legally like do it like yeah they were they were they doing that before with the with the Amazon watch along thing
[255:01.52]Remember when you said you wanted to buy the right- I don't have the kind of money to buy the rights to anything, guys.
[255:08.62]Yeah, yeah, I got the rights to buy... The... The right to eat fucking potato chips on my couch.
[255:19.14]I don't have the kind of money to fucking buy anything.
[255:32.05]But anyways, I think QVC is great.
[255:33.63]I love watching them.
[255:34.99]They bring out the.
[255:37.02]They have like these frozen hamburgers.
[255:39.40]It's just like, oh, there's the frozen hamburgers guy.
[255:41.44]Am I giving him all my possessions?
[255:54.50]Yes, sure, very good.
[255:57.41]Follow me.
[255:58.87]I will take you to the shrine.
[256:26.71]Can I run?
[256:37.67]Okay, you got a lot of stuff.
[256:39.53]He's got a lot of stuff.
[256:41.29]Look at how much stuff he has.
[256:42.87]He's got apples.
[256:44.10]He's got beer on him.
[256:44.92]He's got... He's got a $3,300 ring.
[256:48.08]Why is this all my stuff?
[256:55.60]He has all my belongings.
[256:57.40]Wait, does he have anything that's not mine?
[257:04.91]Doesn't have anything.
[257:05.95]Wait, he had this.
[257:11.52]I don't think I had potatoes.
[257:13.40]I think these are his potatoes.
[257:14.64]I'm serious.
[257:20.69]Can I sort by new?
[257:24.62]Oh boy, what a fucking pain in the ass.
[257:36.23]Greet the new day.
[257:38.12]How can I serve you brother?
[257:42.10]The time of preparation is almost over.
[257:44.62]I don't care.
[257:48.49]Those are your potatoes.
[257:51.39]Can I just beat the shit out of this guy?
[257:54.91]There's nobody else in here.
[257:56.49]Praise be.
[257:59.78]The dragon throne is empty.
[258:03.04]My cover is blown.
[258:05.39]I do not fear death.
[258:11.15]Lord Dagon will welcome your soul in oblivion.
[258:14.26]Paradise awaits me.
[258:18.82]He's singing with them.
[258:20.54]Paradise awaits me.
[258:26.10]Why is he not calling for help?
[258:32.01]Why did he change it to a different person?
[258:43.50]Oh shit!
[259:01.52]Alright, I'm here.
[259:05.82]Are you playing on easy?
[259:08.39]I'm playing on adept.
[259:13.43]Let's hear it.
[259:27.86]When I walk the Earth again, the faithful among you shall receive your reward to be set above all other mortals.
[259:43.98]I didn't know his head was gonna rock back like that.
[259:46.79]I didn't think I was gonna rock him in the face.
[259:50.99]As for the rest, the weak shall be winnowed.
[259:55.26]The timid shall be calmed down.
[259:57.98]The mighty shall tremble at my feet and pray for pardon.
[260:04.19]I'm not on easy.
[260:05.21]So saith Lord Dagon.
[260:08.26]Praise be.
[260:11.64]Your reward, brothers and sisters.
[260:14.29]The time of cleansing draws nigh.
[260:17.49]I go now to Paradise.
[260:19.33]I shall return with Lord Dagon at the coming...
[260:26.10]He's trying to get away.
[260:30.24]He's trying to get away.
[260:31.47]Don't let him go to Oblivion.
[260:35.11]Oh, shit.
[260:40.88]He got away.
[260:41.75]I'm not doing that again.
[260:50.72]Adept is easy.
[260:52.76]What?
[260:53.00]Easy is easy.
[260:54.06]Then there's a soup somewhat easy, and then there's adept.
[260:58.93]As for the rest, the weak shall be winnowed.
[261:03.19]The timid shall be cast down.
[261:06.01]The mighty shall tremble at my feet and pray for pardon.
[261:13.12]So saith John Dagon, praise be.
[261:19.56]Your reward, brothers and sisters, the time of cleansing draws nigh.
[261:25.46]I go now to Paradise.
[261:27.28]I shall return with Lord Dagon at the coming of the dawn.
[261:32.89]Dawn is breaking.
[261:34.79]Dawn is breaking.
[261:38.26]All this talk of living in it is a little bit weird, don't you think so?
[261:47.08]He escaped to his realm of Paradise with the amulet of kings and closed his magical portal behind him.
[261:52.67]But the Mysterium Zarexis itself is here in the shrine.
[261:57.36]I must get the Mysterium Zarexis.
[262:00.66]It is my only hope of finding a way to recover the amulet now.
[262:03.83]We have a new brother who wishes to bind himself to the service of Lord Dagon.
[262:10.20]Advance, Initiate.
[262:15.55]Oh, oh, that's me.
[262:16.69]Oh, OK.
[262:22.08]You have come to dedicate yourself to Lord Dagon's service.
[262:26.32]This pact must be sealed with red drink.
[262:30.11]The blood of Lord Dagon's enemies.
[262:32.41]Yum, let's have it.
[262:34.05]And offer Lord Dagon the sacrificial red drink as pledge of your own life's blood, which shall be his in the end.
[262:46.90]Lord Dagon thirsts for red drink.
[262:49.88]Sate him.
[262:54.25]Whose blood are we drinking?
[262:55.15]Yours?
[262:55.45]Okay.
[263:05.55]Uh, so now what?
[263:16.01]How do I... Who am I stabbing here?
[263:24.36]Oh.
[263:25.08]I see.
[263:30.45]Wait a minute!
[263:30.77]That's Gelius!
[263:35.55]I didn't know they had Gelius here!
[263:36.75]Actually, I don't know who this is.
[263:43.12]You want to release the prisoner.
[263:45.51]Wait, if I release the prisoner, that's going to cause mayhem.
[263:52.21]I actually can't do this when anyone looks at me.
[263:54.84]So I can just look away this.
[263:57.78]You don't want to see this.
[264:05.43]Hello, who's there?
[264:07.75]Who's there?
[264:10.81]Only the chosen will survive the cleansing.
[264:14.52]I do not.
[264:17.94]How is this better?
[264:19.66]How is this better?
[264:21.99]Protect the bro?
[264:30.24]Alright.
[264:32.76]Whoa.
[264:34.08]I'm dead.
[264:43.90]Drew, your character sucks.
[264:45.70]Alright, let's go.
[264:46.48]Do the ritual.
[264:47.10]I know.
[264:47.38]I get it.
[264:49.66]Give me the knife.
[264:50.97]Give me the knife.
[264:51.59]Uh-huh.
[264:52.93]I'll do it.
[264:55.87]I got it.
[264:57.31]Did it.
[265:03.06]Now give me my initiate thing.
[265:08.55]Praise be.
[265:13.83]Your reward, brothers and sisters, the time of cleansing draws nigh.
[265:21.87]I go now to Paradise.
[265:23.69]I shall return.
[265:26.92]Alright, let me try this again.
[265:38.79]As for the rest, dawn is breaking.
[265:41.19]The weak shall be winnowed.
[265:43.20]The timid shall be cast down.
[265:46.02]The mighty shall tremble at my feet and pray for pardon.
[265:50.61]Hey, we get it.
[265:51.15]You don't want to play anymore.
[265:52.09]What?
[265:52.37]I love this.
[265:52.87]That might be something fun.
[265:55.65]What are you talking about?
[265:56.65]Praise me.
[265:59.54]Your reward, brothers and sisters.
[266:02.20]The time of cleansing draws nigh.
[266:05.40]I go now to Paradise.
[266:07.06]I shall return with Lord Dagon at the coming of the dawn.
[266:11.30]I just hit my head on the thing.
[266:26.97]We have a new brother.
[266:28.47]We do.
[266:29.13]You have come to dedicate yourself to Lord Dagon.
[266:31.13]Yes I have.
[266:31.95]Take up the dagger.
[266:33.66]I will.
[266:34.87]Oops.
[266:36.93]That may have been disrespectful to what you're doing here.
[266:46.58]What does it say?
[266:50.30]What are you talking about?
[266:51.32]I can't pick the book up?
[266:56.05]What happened to him?
[266:57.39]What happened?
[266:59.33]Why is that just scratching like a fucking bug?
[267:03.57]He...
[267:04.97]Why did he get fucking crushed?
[267:07.25]That's not cool.
[267:08.27]You mean they could have done that the whole time?
[267:14.26]Who was that?
[267:26.95]Why did he get crushed by all the rocks, man?
[267:29.37]Oh, you can read the book, but you can't pick it up.
[267:35.40]Take a fucking picture with your phone, dick.
[267:39.08]Okay, here we go.
[267:42.29]I need to make sure I have spells ready.
[267:44.33]Free the prisoner.
[267:57.55]Go.
[268:04.47]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[268:06.17]You have all my stuff, don't you?
[268:08.48]I don't know.
[268:08.98]Pick up this fucking staff of lightning.
[268:18.25]You are weak.
[268:20.62]Like the gods you pray to.
[268:21.16]You're a fucking idiot.
[268:24.12]Alright, where's my friend?
[268:29.53]Where'd you go?
[268:32.53]Bro, what are you doing?
[268:33.82]Sleeping!
[268:34.40]Wake up!
[268:50.50]I need my stuff.
[269:05.14]What?
[269:11.43]OK, come over here and talk to me.
[269:25.81]Come over here, it's quiet.
[270:10.75]I can't turn, I wanna crush his head with the gate.
[270:39.96]Greet the- Paragise awaits you.
[271:11.60]Fucking die!
[271:19.21]I got all my stuff.
[271:20.81]Nice job.
[271:24.68]Okay, put all my stuff back on.
[271:29.12]Eat all the food I have.
[271:30.02]Drink all the beer.
[271:31.69]Eat blackberries.
[271:32.99]Hope they're not poisonous.
[271:35.27]Uh, bread.
[271:37.74]Put the amulet on.
[271:38.86]Cheese.
[271:40.78]Good.
[271:41.70]Eat the corn.
[271:43.80]We're good.
[271:53.07]I'm gonna show up as Loki.
[272:06.96]Let me heal.
[272:10.91]Uh, weak potion of healing.
[272:12.36]Let's get this actually on the bar.
[272:17.95]Weak potion of sorcery.
[272:21.17]Okay.
[272:21.93]I think I'm ready.
[272:26.68]What the fuck?
[272:42.17]We're good.
[272:52.28]Okay.
[272:52.40]There's people still down there.
[272:53.46]Did they not aggro?
[273:05.03]You cannot escape the Master's vigilance!
[273:07.85]For Lord Dagon!
[273:10.43]Oh, motherfucker.
[273:15.82]Alright, get up, get up, get up before it collapses.
[273:33.89]We did it.
[273:35.01]Wait, wait, don't run.
[273:38.48]Why are you running?
[273:39.08]Don't run!
[273:40.12]Wait!
[273:40.44]I need to talk to you about what happened!
[273:43.41]Wait!
[273:44.29]Talk!
[273:44.93]Talk to me!
[273:49.40]Why won't he talk to me?
[273:51.94]That's gonna kill me, I think.
[273:53.88]No, we're good.
[274:02.94]Why did that fall?
[274:05.38]I'll give you the book.
[274:12.52]Oh, that's what does it.
[274:17.82]Oh.
[274:22.17]It's a load-bearing book.
[274:24.01]Yeah, that's crazy.
[274:28.40]Let's get out.
[274:37.39]Alright, careful.
[274:41.26]Do you know the way out?
[274:44.16]I'm just gonna follow him.
[274:44.98]I think he knows where he's going.
[274:51.88]Be glad you will not live to see the day Lord Dagon walks here.
[274:55.69]Where'd he go?
[274:57.93]Where is he?
[275:00.17]Did he make it out?
[275:04.06]Paradise awaits.
[275:09.74]I do not.
[275:17.86]Why did he come up here?
[275:18.76]I was just following him.
[275:30.95]Is there anything else I can get in here or no?
[275:41.49]For Lord Dagon!
[275:47.30]I need to enchant my item.
[275:57.44]There's a recipe.
[276:01.91]Ooh, don't mind if I do.
[276:04.23]Take this.
[276:13.91]Another note?
[276:14.87]Head north for an hour or so, you'll see a group of dead trees.
[276:19.38]Yep.
[276:24.03]I'm fighting all these things.
[276:46.55]Oh fuck!
[276:57.23]Die, unbeliever!
[277:02.90]Who's there?
[277:07.89]The door is breaking!
[277:13.11]Oh fuck, there's so many more people.
[277:15.33]Ah!
[277:16.26]Um... Okay, hold on.
[277:18.60]Distracting.
[277:23.37]Go.
[277:32.64]I got the book.
[277:33.12]I don't care about anything else.
[277:35.04]What?

[277:39.53]Uh, you want some money?
[277:43.87]is okay you don't what about um what if I tell you a funny joke you're full of it what about this have you heard the one about the have you heard the one about the 50 cultists chasing after the lizard this is a good one yes see what happened was he killed every single one of us I like
[278:07.25]Oh fuck.
[278:22.21]Lord Dagon!
[278:27.63]Are they swearing?
[278:30.06]Is that a swear word here?
[278:32.10]The wall won't shift.
[278:35.62]Uh oh.
[278:38.77]I'll sit here for an hour.
[278:45.38]I don't care.
[278:45.82]I'll just turtle.
[278:50.64]There's a switch somewhere.
[279:08.62]Freezing Shad!
[279:11.96]Frost damage.
[279:20.08]Three points.
[279:20.86]Destruction.
[279:23.44]Let me test it.
[279:39.01]Dude, that's cool.
[279:43.20]Let's try it on somebody.
[280:01.57]And we're out.
[280:04.23]Good quest management.
[280:10.01]Nice snowball bucko.
[280:11.66]I think it's cool.
[280:16.24]I've escaped with the Mysterium Xarxes.
[280:19.01]Now to deliver it to Martin at Cloud Ruler Temple.
[280:26.68]Did Gelius get out?
[280:31.43]I like this move a lot.
[280:33.61]New move.
[280:34.01]And I got Frost Weapon too.
[280:36.93]What is that?
[280:48.61]The hero's fate is known when the hero's fame has grown.
[280:53.61]Gotta be more famous.
[281:02.32]I need to head back to here.
[281:09.59]Use a soul gem?
[281:14.49]Is that the only way I can recharge it?
[281:16.44]Or can I do it with somebody else in a town?
[281:19.37]Is that the most cost effective way to do it?
[281:24.28]You can pay a merchant.
[281:30.67]It's very expensive.
[281:31.73]Okay.
[281:32.73]So let's deal with this.
[281:35.47]Soul gem.
[281:43.21]A grand soul gem or just a soul gem?
[281:49.02]any soul gem, okay do I even have any others?
[282:04.20]I think that's the only one I have I saw a pretty one
[282:21.49]Lesser soul gem.
[282:25.67]You can only equip a soul gem that has a soul in it.
[282:39.18]Oh, petty soul gem.
[282:41.72]Empty.
[282:49.41]You have to fill them with a spell.
[282:53.82]Okay.
[282:53.94]Well, I'll do that later.
[282:56.50]Thank Talos you've returned safely.
[282:58.65]Do you have the amulet?
[283:01.03]The grand is full.
[283:01.79]I feel like the grand is... Please tell me you have some good news.
[283:10.96]Ah, good.
[283:11.84]You should take that to Martin right away.
[283:14.02]He'll be in the Great Hall reading.
[283:16.05]He's hardly taken time to sleep since you left.
[283:18.73]We decided to do this weird immortality bet with the devil.
[283:23.87]Starting with all these things.
[283:25.62]The last 2,000 years of literature.
[283:30.49]Come on.
[283:30.69]Come on.
[283:31.31]Yes.
[283:31.81]Yes.
[283:32.25]Let me see it.
[283:37.32]Sir.
[283:39.89]Ah, you're back.
[283:41.81]I told Joffrey not to worry.
[283:43.75]I can see you've had bad news.
[283:45.71]You didn't recover the amulet, did you?
[283:47.34]You can recharge it at the mage guild.
[283:50.86]Somebody said it was very expensive, though.
[283:52.36]By the nine, such a thing is dangerous even to handle.
[283:55.43]I'm fine.
[283:55.65]Forgive me.
[283:57.23]You were right to bring it, but you'd better give it to me.
[284:02.00]I know some ways to protect myself from its evil power.
[284:07.70]Okay.
[284:08.68]I don't know.
[284:09.20]Take it.
[284:10.08]Maybe.
[284:10.88]I suspect that the secret of how to open a portal to Cameron's Paradise lies within these pages.
[284:16.79]But I will need time.
[284:18.89]Tampering with dark secrets, even just reading them, can be very dangerous.
[284:24.40]I'll have to proceed carefully.
[284:26.51]In the meantime, you should speak to Joffrey.
[284:28.65]He was concerned about reports of spies in Bruma.
[284:32.15]I accidentally opened up a long play of this like a year or so ago, and I skipped to like the 70% of the playthrough done, and he had blue skin and was a zombie.
[284:45.30]I don't know if that's a problem.
[284:46.77]Did something happen to him or something?
[284:56.68]Nah, don't worry about it?
[284:57.44]Okay.
[285:00.25]I put aside the dark arts when I became a priest.
[285:03.55]But the workings of fate may be seen in this too.
[285:06.26]The gods can turn anything to good.
[285:08.86]Or so I piously told those who came to see me for advice.
[285:12.93]Perhaps I may yet come to believe it myself.
[285:16.90]He said he took a silver supplement for too long.
[285:19.25]That's funny.
[285:20.43]This evil book was written by Mehrunes Dagon himself and given by him to Manka Cameron.
[285:27.57]I believe Manka Cameron used it to create his Paradise.
[285:30.91]It should give us the means to open a gate there ourselves.
[285:34.34]I will continue studying it.
[285:37.40]It is now clear to me that the only way to stop the Oblivion invasion is to relight the Dragonfires.
[285:45.92]Emperor, Amulet, and Dragonfire.
[285:49.20]With these divine gifts, the Daedra of Oblivion have been kept at bay for thousands of years.
[285:55.63]While the Dragonfires burned, the divine barriers kept the Daedra from making more than fleeting visits to our world.
[286:02.48]Stop ruining this for me.
[286:07.53]He looks like he's reading a teleprompter.
[286:33.78]You guys are fucking this whole thing up for me.
[286:39.83]I hope to have at least part of the Mysterium Xarxes translated in a few days.
[286:44.84]Speak to Joffrey about the spies in the meantime.
[286:47.91]Okay.
[286:57.92]It'd be awesome to stand next to one of these.
[287:04.02]Don't fall asleep right here though, right?
[287:09.09]OK, so we learned a lot.
[287:13.69]We now have to speak to Joffrey.
[287:17.16]There could be spies here.
[287:19.04]I think it's this guy.
[287:21.76]Good morning, Sir.
[287:22.76]It's definitely this guy.
[287:24.42]This is 100% a spy.
[287:29.59]Oh, I wonder if we got a reaction from a spy.
[287:51.26]Where's Joffrey?
[287:59.19]Do the Dark Brotherhood quest?
[288:06.68]I can sleep here, right?
[288:13.48]can't stop thinking about about the emperor we failed we failed because oh wait this is my friend we got arrogant now they I never had time to properly thank you for your help back in the imperial city I wouldn't have made it back here if it weren't for you stop thinking about a turkey southern play free moment I thought you might be able to that's all I can think about picked up fighting with the blades over the years nobody who hasn't trained with the blades will know these moves so you should find them useful
[288:43.48]see when they swing at you sidearm you twist your wrists like this exactly you're a natural at this let me show you another one oh cool thanks damn alright um turkey sub with a nice fresh bread lettuce tomato shaved turkey oil and vinegar and then maybe a slice of havarti
[289:13.59]Ugh.
[289:19.41]I haven't been to Cloud Ruler since I was a young trainee.
[289:22.88]It feels good to be back.
[289:24.52]The Blades have always been here and always will be.
[289:28.88]Why are you putting oil on a sandwich?
[289:31.23]You gotta, you gotta get this figured out.
[289:33.97]You got time to figure it out.
[289:35.31]You have a little bit of time here.
[289:36.33]A little drizzle of oil and a little drizzle of vinegar.
[289:41.58]That's all you need.
[289:43.80]Not too much, though.
[289:44.64]It can overpower the whole thing.
[289:48.89]Nice shredded lettuce.
[289:50.65]Sliced cheese.
[289:51.31]Tomato.
[289:51.65]A good... A good tomato.
[289:53.98]And I know I'm... I've been a tomato hater in the past.
[289:56.66]I still am.
[289:58.17]But... Rarely... And we're talking like a 15% chance.
[290:02.64]Getting that... A nice tomato...
[290:06.71]Stay safe.
[290:07.97]And here's the thing about tomatoes.
[290:09.51]This is why I've become less of a tomato hater.
[290:12.40]I came to the realization that what a lot of people do is they do two or three slices of tomato on a sandwich.
[290:21.03]Ruins the entire thing.
[290:23.75]Listen to me.
[290:24.75]When you do three slices of tomato on a sandwich, it stacks, it overlaps on one of them at least every time.
[290:33.30]It'll always be overlapping on the two bottom ones.
[290:36.38]so you'll bite through this double thick layer of tomato and that's what ruins everything you just need one good slice of tomato don't do two don't do three maybe two if it's a long sandwich don't ever do three hail
[291:09.30]He's tomato agnostic.
[291:12.49]Oh, there's Joffrey.
[291:24.12]I fear for what it could do to him if he's not careful.
[291:27.70]Good grilled cheese.
[291:29.50]Listen to this.
[291:30.26]I want you to listen to me.
[291:32.34]Brioche bread.
[291:34.34]A little bit of butter on either side.
[291:36.85]Put it in the pan.
[291:37.59]Do it in the pan.
[291:39.45]You want a slice of medium cheddar.
[291:42.27]You want to do a slice of Havarti on top of that.
[291:44.60]And a slice of medium cheddar on top of that.
[291:46.28]You want the Havarti in the middle.
[291:48.72]Then you're going to drop one slice of tomato on top of the cheddar.
[291:55.93]Cover it with the other piece of bread.
[292:00.89]Get it nice and crispy and crunchy with that brioche.
[292:03.85]You can do mayo too.
[292:04.57]You can, but I enjoy butter more.
[292:09.50]Then that comes off both sides.
[292:11.86]Make sure it makes that when you run your finger or like a knife on it.
[292:19.53]Get it on the plate.
[292:21.52]Take a little bit of ketchup.
[292:25.48]On the plate, take the piece of, take the whole sandwich now.
[292:30.22]Don't cut it in half.
[292:32.35]Let the cheese out that way.
[292:34.11]And you fuck up the tomato.
[292:35.65]Keep it whole.
[292:37.33]Dunk the whole corner into the ketchup.
[292:43.44]Get a good bite.
[292:44.24]Go through the tomato.
[292:45.33]Go through all three cheeses.
[292:48.09]And that is the end of my cooking class.
[292:54.47]catch up catch up do it you're gross you're stupid you're not stupid you're not stupid you said the s word wait did he tell me all the info I needed
[293:25.79]What about tomato soup?
[293:36.86]That's good too.
[293:39.74]Yeah, Tabasco as well.
[293:43.63]You could do Tabasco and the ketchup.
[293:48.51]Make a Tabasco ketchup.
[293:54.98]For the turkey sandwiches, is it baguette or ciabatta?
[293:57.04]Baguette.
[293:57.50]Every time.
[294:00.09]Sure.
[294:00.75]Okay.
[294:15.33]You just gave me a katana.
[294:18.54]Really?
[294:19.12]The coronation of each new emperor is sealed when he uses the amulet of kings to light the dragon fires in the temple of the one.
[294:26.59]The dragon fires of Akatosh remain lit until the death of the emperor.
[294:30.58]Ryosh and Ketchup, somebody stop him.
[294:31.88]His successor then lights them anew upon ascending to the throne.
[294:35.11]With Emperor Uriel dead and no successor crowned, the temple of the one will be dark for the first time in centuries.
[294:42.18]Now you release the real recipe.
[294:45.18]Same deal.
[294:46.21]Brioche bread.
[294:47.75]Butter both sides of it.
[294:49.51]You're going to put that down.
[294:51.35]You're going to spoon in some freshly made tuna fish.
[294:55.72]Get a good can.
[294:57.24]You get that whole, the whole white, solid albacore tuna.
[295:03.13]Mix it up with some mayo.
[295:03.93]Crush it up.
[295:05.57]Now listen.
[295:06.87]Listen, idiot.
[295:08.16]You idiot.
[295:10.01]Take jalapeños.
[295:11.99]Just a few.
[295:13.17]Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop.
[295:14.21]Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop, chop.
[295:15.81]Chop them up.
[295:16.50]Very fine.
[295:17.56]Don't have big pieces of it.
[295:19.20]Mix that into the tuna fish.
[295:20.70]Mix it up.
[295:21.16]Mix it up.
[295:21.56]There you go.
[295:22.10]I see what you're doing.
[295:22.64]Nice.
[295:23.34]Good moving with your wrist there.
[295:24.81]Keep going.
[295:25.97]Stop like that.
[295:26.73]Get them incorporated.
[295:27.89]Black pepper.
[295:29.01]Got it.
[295:29.51]Good.
[295:29.67]A little bit more.
[295:30.35]A little more.
[295:31.22]Be generous with this.
[295:32.56]Good.
[295:34.92]That's a little too much, but you can scrape it off.
[295:36.50]It's fine.
[295:37.63]Take that.
[295:39.15]Get two slices of Swiss cheese, not one.
[295:42.76]Two.
[295:44.00]One, two.
[295:45.68]You want to do one on the bottom.
[295:48.01]Put down the tuna and jalapeño tuna fish that you have.
[295:51.85]Remember, I'm talking about with mayo.
[295:53.55]Make a tuna fish, like making a tuna fish sandwich.
[295:56.98]Black pepper brings out a bunch of good shit too.
[295:59.00]Get that in there.
[295:59.74]Put the second slice of Swiss cheese on top of that.
[296:02.63]Cover it up.
[296:03.65]Tuna melt.
[296:04.21]Boom, boom.
[296:05.01]Do the same thing you would with the grilled cheese.
[296:08.70]Hey, can you even cook legitimate meals?
[296:10.08]How about a real dish?
[296:13.38]Okay, so take a piece of salmon.
[296:15.97]You want to get some olive oil on it.
[296:19.13]You want to bake the salmon.
[296:20.05]Don't put it in the pan.
[296:25.36]I don't like salmon in the pan.
[296:26.80]I prefer it in the oven.
[296:29.42]Oh, he does cheese and fish.
[296:30.43]I'm just telling you about two sandwiches I like.
[296:39.16]And you know what?
[296:39.62]Get some spinach.
[296:41.42]Cook the spinach down.
[296:43.72]Don't overcook it.
[296:45.51]Lemon juice.
[296:47.09]Chop up some garlic.
[296:48.03]Throw the garlic in there.
[296:48.81]Make the whole cloves.
[296:50.05]Not whole cloves, but don't mush it.
[296:52.20]Chop up a bunch of garlic, lemon, olive oil, garlic, spinach.
[296:57.56]You're going to lay that down after the salmon's done.
[297:01.05]On top of that, you're going to make a little pile, a little thing that you move it around so the salmon will fit in the middle.
[297:05.51]Make a little spinach moat.
[297:08.79]That guy still here?
[297:15.24]Keep your heart true and your eyes open.
[297:23.93]Well, didn't I do that?
[297:27.42]Is it the one option I didn't do?
[297:30.86]What is it?
[297:33.22]The Elder Council rules in the Emperor's absence by ancient tradition.
[297:37.75]Chancellor Akato heads the Elder Council and is the closest thing the Empire has to a leader right now.
[297:44.08]You're losing views?
[297:47.41]But I'm gaining strength.
[297:50.89]ah yes I hope you can help the gate guards have reported seeing strangers on the road for the past several nights I cannot leave cloud ruler undefended while my men search the whole mountainside but these spies must be eliminated this is Larry David sandwich with like three different fish on it I actually probably unironically would like the Larry David sandwich
[298:19.06]was a big recall on tuna recently oh well be careful look it up the Larry David sandwich sounds great thank you talk to stefan he can tell you where he has seen them captain verd in bruma may also be able to help I've asked the countess to have the guard keep an eye out for strangers and kill them find out what they know and what they're planning if I gotta kill some spies we got it I'm counting on you to eliminate those spies
[298:46.80]We can't afford to let the mythic don't operate.
[298:49.90]It's white fish, sable, capers, onions, cream cheese.
[298:56.41]I probably would eat that.
[299:10.31]Holy shit, this thing's awesome.
[299:14.11]Is that better than the chill rend?
[299:15.25]Probably for now.
[299:16.11]I don't know.
[299:23.03]thing's sick okay there actually was a tuna fish recall so check your brands if you eat tuna fish good morning sir good evening sir okay time to kill some spies
[299:52.27]I'm going to take a break.
[299:53.08]This is probably the last break of the night or the afternoon.
[299:56.42]I'll come back and we will go get these spies.
[300:01.03]Is it morning or evening?
[300:04.27]Do you guys consider if the sun is out?
[300:06.33]Is it evening yet?
[300:07.36]Or is it evening when the sun goes down?
[300:09.20]Because the sun is technically still up here.
[300:24.05]Anything past 4 when it's dark after 6?
[300:26.53]I would say after 6 makes sense to me.
[300:32.76]You probably feel so much heavy metals, refrigerator magnets stick to you.
[300:40.81]If you ate my split pea soup, you would be speaking a different language than here.
[300:47.90]Takes a long time.
[300:49.58]It's worth it.
[300:54.61]Hello.
[300:57.81]What can I do for you?
[301:02.34]Not on my watch.
[301:03.76]Captain Bird will know for sure though.
[301:05.78]We all report to him.
[301:09.43]Is this a spy?
[301:10.09]Alright, I'm back three minutes.
[301:18.02]This will be the last break.
[301:19.04]I'll see you guys in like three minutes.
[301:38.98]Thank you.
[303:37.27]you
[305:33.40]Alright, let's uh... dial it down a little, huh?
[305:39.49]It's chill time, let's go.
[305:41.83]You got any rumors for me?
[305:42.73]Did you hear about Braden Lirian?
[305:45.70]A vampire hunter named Raynal Draelis made his way into town, snuck in... Oops.
[305:52.44]Yes, the vampire hunter.
[305:55.09]As far as I know, he just showed up recently here in Bruma.
[305:58.07]Not only that, but he already found a vampire among us.
[306:02.65]Vampire.
[306:04.17]Okay.
[306:05.27]So am I just supposed to kind of interrogate everybody or just talk to people or... Wait, people get mad at this?
[306:47.65]I'm kind of wearing a crown, aren't I?
[306:55.96]What's in here?
[307:20.46]What's all this?
[307:21.10]Okay.
[307:23.68]Worth a thousand bucks.
[307:33.62]What do you mean right here?
[307:36.88]Who are you?
[307:38.04]Bird?
[307:39.59]I'm Captain Bird, commander of the Bruma Guard.
[307:44.05]What do you know about spies?
[307:56.91]Not yet.
[307:58.65]Okay.
[308:19.50]Hello.
[308:24.63]Hmm.
[308:24.73]Greetings.
[308:36.91]Nice.
[308:44.74]Hey, Gerald.
[308:49.29]Come on out, Gerald.
[308:51.81]Can you knock on doors?
[309:10.92]Security master unlocked.
[309:17.28]Only three tumblers now fall when you break a pick.
[309:20.51]For Lord Dagon, you cannot escape the master's vigilance.
[309:24.63]Oh, shit.
[309:25.53]For Lord Dagon.
[309:28.88]It's both of them.
[309:29.80]The time of cleansing is almost here.
[309:33.00]Only a chosen will survive the cleansing.
[309:37.99]You are weak, but the time of cleansing is almost here.
[309:43.63]This move sucks!
[309:51.96]Oh, oh good friend.
[310:04.26]Nice job.
[310:05.86]Okay.
[310:06.32]Oh!
[310:06.84]I hope he's okay.
[310:16.14]Basement key?
[310:20.46]Cool You got a basement here?
[310:46.72]Ah.
[310:56.71]What's down here?
[311:02.24]Oh, mythic dawn book.
[311:10.07]Orders for Jeryl.
[311:13.79]Cool.
[311:15.17]Master was pleased.
[311:17.13]First three lesser gates represent only the preliminary stage of the great gate deployment.
[311:23.26]Okay, so there's three gates.
[311:39.14]Shit, I have too much stuff.
[311:44.55]I have too many of these.
[311:48.46]Five pounds each.
[311:54.30]So this is just down here.
[311:55.33]I've been down here before.
[312:01.90]If we can get him to start the Dark Brotherhood or Shivering Isles, he will.
[312:05.38]With cooked.
[312:08.43]What?
[312:11.33]What are you doing down here?
[312:12.87]Why is a guard down here?
[312:16.67]Is this the one I hit?
[312:28.21]Okay, he's the only one down here.
[312:29.63]Can I just kill him?
[312:33.44]They saw you break into the house, but there were spies and they were bad guys.
[312:37.74]So I don't get it.
[312:39.22]Do I actually have to go to jail?
[312:43.99]If I kill him is it bad?
[312:47.05]They'll know if somebody dies.
[312:51.90]That's too bad.
[312:52.80]I was hoping you'd resist arrest.
[312:56.52]OK, here's the proceed.
[312:58.80]I know I get it, whatever.
[313:02.15]It was 45 copper.
[313:05.03]That's fine.
[313:18.39]You having a bad time?
[313:20.31]Why does everybody think I'm having a bad time?
[313:21.71]I'm having a great time.
[313:22.89]I'm just chilling.
[313:33.12]You just got real quiet.
[313:37.29]Good evening, sir.
[313:38.56]I'm just hanging out.
[313:43.90]People really want you to dislike the game.
[313:45.65]I'm having fun.
[313:48.79]It's all good.
[313:49.79]What have you learned about the spies?
[313:51.83]Both dead.
[313:53.22]Excellent work.
[313:55.18]I knew I could count on you.
[313:56.48]The gods did not idly choose you as their agent.
[313:59.87]Whatever you may think.
[314:00.99]into the stream?
[314:01.97]Probably soon.
[314:02.81]Maybe after I clean this up and sell some stuff.
[314:06.53]I will warn the Countess of the danger.
[314:08.28]I'm very hungry.
[314:08.90]You should speak to Martin.
[314:10.60]I believe he has made some progress with the Mysterium Zoxys.
[314:17.13]Okay.
[314:17.25]I will send word to the Countess at once of the danger to Bruma.
[314:20.29]Very cool.
[314:20.65]You should speak to Martin about his progress with the Zoxys.
[314:23.74]Alright Martin.
[314:25.10]What do we got?
[314:26.04]But it seems you did alright on your own.
[314:31.21]Okay, does he get mad if you pick all of his books up that he's reading?
[314:39.32]Oh, okay.
[314:39.58]He doesn't really care.
[314:40.34]I've deciphered part of the ritual needed to open a portal to Cameron's Paradise.
[314:44.40]The Xarxes mentions four items needed for the ritual.
[314:47.80]Another four things?
[314:48.80]So far, I have only deciphered one of them.
[314:51.51]The blood of a Daedric Lord.
[314:53.87]In fact, Daedric artifacts are known to be formed from the essence of a Daedric Lord.
[314:58.77]From whence they derive their great power.
[315:01.72]Not an easy thing to come by, obviously.
[315:04.35]But we will need a Daedric artifact.
[315:07.66]Does a heart count?
[315:08.32]Because I have a bunch of those.
[315:10.53]The only way to obtain a Daedric artifact is through the cults devoted to each of the Daedric lords.
[315:17.36]The book Modern Heretics is the best introduction to Daedric cults.
[315:21.72]The library here has a copy if you need it.
[315:23.81]Remember, the Mysterium Xarxes ritual will consume the physical form of the artifact in order to release its Daedric power.
[315:33.39]I've learned that the Mysterium Xarxes is both the gate and the key to Cameron's Paradise.
[315:40.55]In some sense, the book is Cameron's Paradise.
[315:44.09]Manka Cameron bound himself to the Xarxes when he created his Paradise, using dark rituals which I will not speak of further.
[315:52.58]A gate can be opened from the outside, however.
[315:55.67]It will be more difficult as I will have to temporarily bind myself to the book, but I believe it can be done.
[316:02.54]I will continue working to decipher the arcade items needed for the binding ritual.
[316:08.83]OK, I think I'm close to deciphering more of the ritual.
[316:12.39]I hope to have made some progress by the time you return with the Daedric artifact.
[316:17.06]Alright, so I need a Daedric artifact.
[316:19.32]I also need to sleep.
[316:22.67]Are any of these beds?
[316:23.29]Can I sleep in any of these beds?
[316:24.39]I should be able to, right?
[316:37.27]I kind of don't care.
[317:02.97]Time to go sleep in the inn.
[317:08.38]What are you doing for a build right now?
[317:11.07]I want to do summoning.
[317:13.73]Where can I see the character?
[317:15.51]Okay, right here.
[317:17.66]I have invisibility, which I've not used once.
[317:21.96]I think I used it in the tutorial and I haven't clicked it since.
[317:25.55]I'm doing a bunch of magic.
[317:31.92]I'm very acrobatic very conjuring is the highest stat in athletics I need more conjuring okay journeyman level conjuration spells is coming up soon a bunch of free mats in the barracks cool
[318:02.03]Can I sleep with the horses?
[318:08.78]Bam the spells to level them up.
[318:09.92]I'm actually pretty close.
[318:10.86]How long will it take to do that?
[318:18.94]45.
[318:19.98]Almost there.
[318:22.87]Just chug potions and do it?
[318:39.66]Just wait an hour?
[318:43.56]That's a cool strat, okay.
[318:55.96]How long will this take?
[318:59.45]People can train you at the mage university?
[319:04.37]I guess that doesn't take very long.
[319:10.88]Uh, saying the barracks was in here.
[319:14.06]Yes.
[319:20.13]The West Wing.
[319:22.49]What do you need friend?
[319:24.25]East Wing.
[319:29.04]Where's the barracks?
[319:36.38]The West Wing.
[319:48.37]Okay.
[319:48.86]Sir.
[319:49.18]Hi.
[319:58.59]What the hell is it?
[320:02.57]Oh.
[320:03.89]Okay.
[320:10.28]I'm going to do every point into... I got to do some of the other abilities down here.
[320:18.80]Get this to 80.
[320:19.24]Get this to 65 and then I don't know.
[320:22.93]I do maybe endurance.
[320:26.67]I feel like I need more health too.
[320:30.07]Yeah, I'm doing that.
[320:33.08]Cool.
[320:33.36]Alright.
[320:38.46]I think I'm going to call it here.
[320:41.09]I'm very hungry.
[320:41.61]I'm going to get some food.
[320:44.85]I think this is a good place to stop.
[320:46.01]Just did a major quest.
[320:49.45]They were alright.
[320:50.37]It was in EOSV.
[320:54.21]You were right.
[320:54.72]I think it's great though.
[320:58.94]I'm going to continue to play this.
[320:59.84]We will see this.
[321:00.55]I'll probably do this at the end of streams from now on.
[321:04.15]We got a pretty good baseline.
[321:05.41]I got to play it for about 12 to 15 hours.
[321:07.84]I'm having fun.
[321:08.74]I like it.
[321:09.92]This will be a wind down game from now on.
[321:20.98]I will be live next probably some middle of week probably.
[321:33.34]Thursday, Wednesday.
[321:49.25]I'm going to miss the Night Rain launch, so if you're excited about seeing that on this stream, you will see it.
[321:56.28]It's going to be a few days later.
[321:58.75]Hope it's good.
[321:59.57]Hope you'll have fun with it.
[322:01.86]And I'm going to do something sick right now.
[322:07.23]Oh, I was trying to jump on it.
[322:10.33]But yeah, that's it for tonight.
[322:11.45]I'll see you guys on probably Thursday.
[322:13.67]There could be a surprise Wednesday stream, but just bank on Thursday.
[322:17.40]I don't know what we're going to do.
[322:19.42]I got a lot of stuff that I want to do.
[322:21.87]Tons of games that are available.
[322:24.09]Maybe not a game at all.
[322:24.87]We'll see.
[322:26.85]I'll update the sus as we get closer.
[322:28.66]Can just keep it vague for now.
[322:35.41]See you later.
[322:40.25]Have a good rest of your long weekend.
[322:46.40]Don't abandon this game.
[322:47.40]This is, no, I'm going to play it pretty much every time.
[322:50.10]Okay, remember Chrono Trigger.
[322:52.63]I'm going to treat this from now on like Chrono Trigger.
[322:57.22]So you'll see it again.
[322:58.32]You'll see it at the end of streams for two or three hours at the end of each stream.
[323:04.29]I can't tell you I'm going to beat every single thing and do every single mission and do every single DLC, but I'm going to just keep doing it until I'm done with it.
[323:25.60]Very much enjoying it.
[323:26.48]I get it.
[323:27.34]It's very funny.
[323:28.80]It's very fun.
[323:29.84]It's buggy and weird in all the right ways.
[323:33.28]I get it.
[323:33.79]It's fun.
[323:34.19]I like it.
[323:35.19]I'm going to keep playing it.
[323:46.06]Yeah, I will... Oh, I... I'm still alive.
[323:50.28]Okay, I just fell off a cliff.
[323:55.99]Do the Dark Brotherhood in Shivering Isles and I think we will be happy.
[324:00.86]Okay.
[324:01.00]Okay.
[324:03.69]I don't know what that means, but I'll probably do it.
[324:09.42]Alright.
[324:09.68]See you later.
[324:10.32]See you midweek.
[324:11.77]Take care.
