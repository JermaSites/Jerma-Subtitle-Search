[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.05]You guys even counted down.
[00:02.61]You counted down and I got it right at the exact second I went to 12.
[00:05.83]It was like 3, 2, 1, bang, live.
[00:13.25]I'm not even here yet.
[00:14.19]Give me my two minutes that I have in solidarity while I just sit here and breathe deeply and get ready and talk into my mirror that's right here on the left side of my screen.
[00:26.82]You're gonna do this.
[00:28.30]It's gonna be a good stream today.
[00:30.30]You're gonna knock it out of the park, Jeremy.
[00:32.18]Give me a minute.
[01:24.44]Alright, I'm back.
[01:28.72]Good morning, or good afternoon, wherever you are.
[01:30.68]Today we're going to play Evolver.
[01:35.87]Which, it's, who knows?
[01:38.03]This could be a home run, or this could be a foul ball.
[01:45.21]What do you mean foul ball?
[01:46.65]Because if I don't like it, we're going to pivot to something else.
[01:54.23]It's not an immediate strikeout.
[01:56.85]Strikeout would mean that the stream turns off.
[01:59.03]No.
[02:02.15]I have another one lined up.
[02:04.53]And I don't want to say what it is, because that's the problem I have with these streams.
[02:08.38]Whenever I have a backup game, and I tell everybody what the backup game is, all of a sudden, it's like, do that instead!
[02:15.98]No, no, no, just don't even play this!
[02:17.86]Let's do that!
[02:18.48]Please do that!
[02:20.97]I'm not going to tell you what the backup game is.
[02:22.23]You'll know what the backup game is if we need a backup game, okay?
[02:26.61]No, it's not a Sir's Wrath.
[02:28.01]I'm sorry to all the people that hate me now because I'm not going to play that.
[02:33.55]I do have something to tell you, though.
[02:36.39]Something important.
[02:40.41]It is the official date and the official time of FTK Favor the King Minecraft
[02:52.27]Got a real date for you and a time.
[02:56.25]It's going to be September 13th at 3 p.m.
[03:00.05]Pacific.
[03:02.77]Gives everybody that's involved across all the many time zones to get it put together.
[03:12.57]I'll give you some very brief details.
[03:14.94]Detail number one.
[03:16.94]You don't have to be a multi-sub to be there anymore.
[03:20.68]You just have to be an active sub.
[03:24.36]That's it.
[03:24.70]Nothing else.
[03:28.80]It is not what you think it is.
[03:31.18]It's not the same game.
[03:33.04]It has been completely reimagined and completely redesigned.
[03:39.91]You just have to be a current subscriber to the channel.
[03:45.97]Are the servers going to be shit like last time?
[03:48.25]No.
[03:49.47]The problem with last time is there was only, I think, one or two servers that were handling all the traffic.
[03:55.16]This time, there's a lot.
[04:00.22]There's, I think there's like 10 servers that are handling all this.
[04:14.05]We would make it 20.
[04:16.17]I'm going to listen to 100 gecs.
[04:20.75]I already did.
[04:21.37]What do you want me to do?
[04:22.79]Do I have to watch 100 gecs at the beginning of every stream?
[04:26.31]Is that like a routine?
[04:28.59]Is that like my new starting soon screen?
[04:30.37]It's going to be, oh, we're going to watch 100 gecs.
[04:33.73]Starting soon.
[04:37.07]Thanks, AtmaStarfish, for the five community subs.
[04:39.59]I'm a little winded.
[04:41.91]I ran up and down the stairs like four times.
[04:45.55]I wanted to be exactly on time at exactly 12 o'clock.
[04:50.65]So I went like up, up, up, down, down, down, down, up, up, up, down, down, down, up, up, up, down, down.
[04:53.96]Where's my keys?
[04:54.76]Where's my phone?
[04:55.16]Where's my phone?
[04:55.56]Phone, phone, phone.
[04:56.04]Got my phone.
[04:56.78]Shit.
[04:57.12]No, I've got to get a water.
[04:58.44]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[04:59.60]Water.
[04:59.82]Okay, pour quick.
[05:00.44]Get up there.
[05:00.84]It's 1158.
[05:01.66]Up, up, up, up, up.
[05:02.20]Wait.
[05:02.38]Hold on.
[05:04.32]Where's the dog?
[05:05.84]Auto.
[05:06.10]Auto.
[05:06.38]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[05:07.36]Like up the stairs.
[05:07.92]Auto.
[05:08.38]Looking for it.
[05:08.76]Auto.
[05:09.60]No, no, I see you.
[05:10.28]You're right there.
[05:10.70]It's okay.
[05:13.21]So I like exercised like five to ten straight minutes before I turn this on so I'm a little winded It's okay He lives in a mansion No, it's just one small staircase, but when you go up and down it like 30 times in five minutes you get you get a little disheveled In an eight-story house
[05:42.48]No.
[05:43.36]I would never want to live in an eight story house.
[05:45.14]You know how much that would suck?
[05:46.08]I don't want to live in a big ass house.
[05:49.22]No, fuck that.
[05:50.02]That would be horrible.
[05:56.55]It would scare the shit out of me.
[05:57.63]And every noise I heard would be a person in the house.
[06:00.87]Somebody could live in your house.
[06:02.21]If you had like 12 bedrooms and your house was like 15,000 square feet, somebody could literally come live in your house and you wouldn't fucking know they were there.
[06:11.55]They could just sleep in one of the bedrooms and when they heard you coming, just hide in the closet.
[06:15.09]Oh, okay, he's gone.
[06:16.45]Like, you have so much food in your fridge that you can't even tell if one guy's eating, like, fucking Cheerios out of your pantry or not.
[06:21.21]Nobody would even know.
[06:22.51]No, forget that.
[06:23.11]No, no, I'm not doing that.
[06:24.19]I'm never having 12 fucking rooms.
[06:27.15]They could, like, jump from room to room and it would be like playing Hitman without killing anybody.
[06:31.49]You're just trying to sleep in their beds.
[06:34.54]No, not happening.
[06:42.58]Get out.
[06:45.62]That's just a sitcom.
[06:46.48]Alright, anyways.
[06:51.30]Anyways, anyways, anyways.
[06:52.86]We're going to play Evolva.
[06:54.08]This is going to be either a PogChamp or a Frog Damp.
[07:02.28]Who knows?
[07:07.49]Oh, come on.
[07:07.95]That was not that bad.
[07:10.05]Like Damp versus like Pog.
[07:13.58]I'm taking that one.
[07:14.73]I deserve it.
[07:16.53]I deserved that one.
[07:17.35]I ate my fucking vegetables last night.
[07:19.03]I deserve at least a +2 for that one.
[07:23.49]Let's go.
[07:29.92]He just made a new saying.
[07:33.96]Yeah.
[07:35.10]Thank you.
[07:37.86]Yeah, everyone's gonna be mad because this game's not in like 16x9.
[07:41.71]There's no widescreen for this game.
[07:44.15]So it just doesn't exist.
[07:46.75]Unfortunately.
[07:48.81]So it's stuck in a 4x3 window.
[07:50.51]There's no widescreen patch.
[07:52.15]I already looked.
[07:54.71]You ready?
[07:56.79]Alright, here we go.
[07:57.17]We're gonna do a new game.
[08:00.53]Hopefully it's not too loud.
[08:03.03]So this game you get a team of...
[08:07.39]of Power Rangers or whatever they are.
[08:10.44]And you get to make your team and they all evolve over the course of the game.
[08:16.74]It's too ugly.
[08:18.36]Oh, please.
[08:20.50]You've watched me play a PlayStation 1 game on this channel with like a cell phone quality image.
[08:24.56]I think you can handle this.
[08:27.73]We have an agile, a speed, a heavy, and an intelligent.
[08:33.79]Purple alien.
[08:34.59]Yeah, come on, man.
[08:38.73]This is Purple Alien from the F.A.S.T.
[08:41.19]Jerma and Purple Alien Saga.
[08:45.05]Can I do Purp Alien?
[08:49.70]Okay, it's gonna be Purple A for Purple Alien.
[08:53.46]Speed type.
[08:56.42]Oh, I can change the color.
[08:57.94]Wait, it doesn't have to be purple.
[09:00.14]It can be anything I want.
[09:01.10]Oh, alright.
[09:03.67]Well, should it just still be Purple Alien?
[09:08.27]P-Alien.
[09:11.43]Yes.
[09:12.45]Okay, fine.
[09:15.32]Purple A or P-Alien?
[09:16.94]Okay, yeah, that's fine.
[09:21.74]Alright, this is the agile.
[09:22.70]This is the speed one.
[09:24.28]This can't be fast Jerma.
[09:25.84]It can't do that.
[09:33.27]Make this Sonic.
[09:40.52]This team sucks already.
[09:42.63]Purple alien, Sonic.
[09:47.55]This is not beanbag Sonic, this is like smushed with an anvil Sonic.
[09:54.04]Like smashed head in car door Sonic?
[09:56.24]Car door Sonic?
[10:03.77]Alright, this is gonna be CD Sonic.
[10:10.89]CD Sedonic.
[10:12.31]No.
[10:13.65]CD Sonic.
[10:14.61]Come on.
[10:15.06]Do I really... I think this one's doing all the damage.
[10:24.62]I think you have to really be able to differentiate between them.
[10:28.49]We're not going to have all the same color.
[10:31.11]Make him the Hulk.
[10:36.43]If I make him the Hulk, you mean...
[10:39.20]Like a makeshift shitty fourth grade Hulk costume.
[10:44.26]Or like the big kid in class.
[10:48.08]Alright, big kid Hulk.
[10:54.18]Why do they all have abbreviations before?
[10:56.08]Alright, this is big kid Hulk.
[11:03.39]And then this is the intelligent one.
[11:05.17]Which is absolutely, it's gonna have to be me.
[11:10.87]Jeremy E. There we go.
[11:15.23]Shit.
[11:18.86]It's like I'm filling out an application.
[11:24.97]Ask Jerma.
[11:30.81]Evil Jeremy.
[11:31.69]No, what color should I be?
[11:34.20]Red?
[11:34.52]Well, green, blue, and purple are already taken.
[11:39.22]I have to be teal.
[11:40.88]Aqua.
[11:42.64]Or... Chrome?
[11:48.76]I have to be red.
[11:51.12]Yellow?
[11:52.48]Can I even do yellow?
[11:55.60]Yellow doesn't exist.
[11:59.28]I should be chrome.
[12:02.51]Okay, like a crumb.
[12:06.48]Yeah, I'll be like metallic or something.
[12:10.34]No, I'm just going to be red.
[12:12.34]Because I will lose track of who the fuck is who.
[12:15.44]That looks good.
[12:16.10]Alright, the name of the team is Genoteam.
[12:20.43]That's not going to work.
[12:21.09]What should it be called?
[12:22.49]We got P-Alien, C-D-Sonic, B-K-Hulk, and E-Jeremy.
[12:27.78]Just the family?
[12:31.21]My family.
[12:34.42]Imagine that's your superhero team name.
[12:44.10]My family.
[12:44.80]It's going to have to be my family.
[12:46.86]My family.
[12:47.84]My family rocks.
[12:52.51]The Incredibles.
[12:53.49]No.
[12:54.17]My family.
[12:56.90]Here we go.
[12:57.30]Analysis.
[12:59.15]The probe has detected planetary debris containing biomatter entering... Okay, I'm not going to try that hard.
[13:04.65]You know, what do I have to do that for?
[13:06.51]The probe has detected planetary debris containing biomatter entering the X92 system.
[13:11.78]Contact with the debris was lost when it entered the atmosphere of planet X92-3.
[13:15.54]Twelve hours later, the probe recorded a significant increase in seismic...
[13:20.99]Did I tell you guys this story how I used to do that to my mother?
[13:25.11]She'd be reading me a story and she'd be reading like that and every time she would nod off I would kind of nudge her a little and she'd go back to where she was.
[13:33.48]Happened all the time.
[13:35.06]She'd be reading me a story in bed.
[13:38.97]And I would have to, she'd start to nod off, and I would go, like, just nudge a little, and she'd go, like, as if I was powering her back on.
[13:48.53]I was, like, turning my mother back on with zero battery with an iPhone.
[13:52.61]She would turn on, I would see the Apple screen, and then immediately would shut off, and I would fucking be, like, annoyed.
[14:01.95]Alright, what are we doing?
[14:02.51]Okay.
[14:03.18]Use the O arrow on your compass for objective to find your way to the objective.
[14:23.40]Attack dead creatures to absorb their meat.
[14:26.91]Mutate your genohunters using the genes and the meat to give them a new ability.
[14:32.43]Use the new ability to gain access to the previously inaccessible area.
[14:35.63]Is this a Metroidvania?
[14:39.91]Antigenetic sample from any non-indigenous lifeform by mutating your genohunters.
[14:43.45]Get all remaining genohunters to pick up point.
[14:53.91]You promised.
[14:54.51]What did I promise?
[14:58.03]I can't alt tab.
[14:58.87]Somebody explains to me.
[15:00.77]That's a tiny cutscene.
[15:04.15]That's the littlest cutscene.
[15:08.23]I can't alt tab.
[15:09.25]What is it?
[15:09.59]Tell me what it says.
[15:10.37]I'll crash the game.
[15:13.19]Tell us the skeleton radiation story.
[15:15.07]Oh, right, right, right.
[15:15.73]Hold on.
[15:16.01]I will after this small screen.
[15:25.64]So this is us.
[15:26.46]This is my family.
[15:34.57]Are we going to Earth?
[15:38.13]Is that Earth?
[15:43.15]It looks like Earth.
[15:48.13]Do we send down an avocado pit?
[15:50.99]That turns into my family?
[15:52.19]Pretty accurate, I guess.
[16:07.98]I'm not gonna do the whole stream like this.
[16:16.43]The reason why this cutscene looks like this is because this is back in like 2002.
[16:19.95]Nice dodge, holy shit.
[16:27.22]Can I get one of those on my team?
[16:28.32]Those things are awesome.
[16:31.24]That's the most insane reaction ever.
[16:38.22]It's because all games in 2002 had like a 240p rendered full motion cutscenes.
[16:45.18]Okay, hold on a second.
[16:46.30]Use the O on your compass to find the objective.
[16:49.03]Do I have to control everybody?
[16:52.85]There's two or three different cameras down there?
[16:55.71]Alright, I feel like this is a multi-block stream.
[17:02.66]This really is what it's like to play WoW with multi-blocks.
[17:06.65]Can I select other people?
[17:07.69]Oh, there's a punch.
[17:09.11]I just punched somebody.
[17:10.73]Hold on.
[17:10.99]First of all, this is so loud.
[17:12.55]I found my calling in life.
[17:28.43]It's this.
[17:28.73]It's just to listen to this over and over again.
[17:31.55]Alright.
[17:31.75]I'm supposed to turn it down, not up.
[17:36.39]Okay, mouse sensitivity, that's fine.
[17:38.33]Okay, I'll tell you the... Okay, so I had a nuclear bone scan.
[17:44.34]Which, if you don't know what a nuclear bone scan is, they put a small amount of radiation into your body.
[17:50.80]And you go into this camera that looks like a jokey x-ray vision video game machine.
[17:58.18]Where if you put your hand under it after getting this tracer put into you, you can see your hand like a cartoon underneath it.
[18:07.96]And I looked at the images afterwards, and it was the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life.
[18:13.21]My entire skeleton, as naked as I could possibly be, was just every angle of my body, every angle of my skeleton.
[18:25.74]And I want to show it on stream.
[18:28.04]I don't have these images yet, but is that like term, is that TOS?
[18:33.08]Because that would be the ultimate in me showing you my naked body on stream.
[18:37.64]Is that TOS?
[18:39.36]That's what's under my clothes and what's under my skin.
[18:41.47]So it's only when the skin is on top that it's TOS, right?
[18:47.41]Is that how that works?
[18:54.65]Okay.
[18:57.53]And muscles, yeah, whatever.
[19:01.07]What about your penis bone?
[19:04.83]And you got it out of me and it hadn't even been 20 minutes.
[19:08.01]Okay, let's go.
[19:10.63]Show it.
[19:10.98]I'll show it when I get it, but it was ridiculous.
[19:14.10]It was one of the most weird... Is there a gun?
[19:18.92]Who has a gun?
[19:19.52]Somebody's shooting a rifle.
[19:24.26]Alright, we gotta go.
[19:25.06]How do I select other aliens?
[19:26.52]Or do they just walk behind me?
[19:29.79]Okay, I have a punch.
[19:31.65]Can we eat these eggs?
[19:33.91]Alright, eat these, eat these!
[19:36.22]Eat these eggs!
[19:46.34]Why do I feel like this is three of you guys just waiting for me to do- HEY!
[19:52.50]Do not punch him!
[19:55.40]What do I do with those?
[19:56.88]Wait, that isn't a- this isn't- where's the objective?
[19:58.60]This way.
[20:01.79]I feel like I should be able to eat these things.
[20:03.13]Can I?
[20:09.18]Oh, the objective is like right here.
[20:12.82]Oh shit, it's down here.
[20:13.60]Okay.
[20:13.76]Okay, I can't control these guys.
[20:19.56]I cannot control the other three chat members.
[20:23.41]They have their own camera.
[20:24.67]Okay, just don't stand over there.
[20:32.69]You see, if this was really chat, one of you would have died by that.
[20:36.27]One of you would have died.
[20:37.73]I'm surprised it wasn't me.
[20:40.11]Alright, we have to find the first mutator.
[20:45.63]There's no way we're going to be able to get through that.
[20:51.32]We're not going to be able to do this.
[20:53.46]Can I switch?
[20:54.02]Does somebody else have a power?
[20:58.64]Don't get that close.
[21:02.68]Use the fast one.
[21:04.18]Um... Oh, shit!
[21:10.26]Faster!
[21:12.70]Wait, no, no, no!
[21:13.36]Don't follow me up here!
[21:23.95]Oh, dead creature.
[21:24.85]Who should get the first power-up?
[21:26.73]Big kid Hulk, for sure.
[21:34.22]Alright, good.
[21:35.78]What did that do?
[21:36.22]Can we level up?
[21:39.60]Mutate.
[21:42.41]What happened?
[21:42.79]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[21:44.29]What happened?
[21:48.35]He gets a jump?
[21:49.79]What, he just changed?
[21:51.49]He can change to be green?
[21:54.54]He can be greener.
[21:58.36]Did we make him greener?
[22:01.00]Okay, he's...
[22:03.19]Wait, he has a jump.
[22:04.35]Oh, he has a jump now.
[22:05.23]He didn't have one before.
[22:07.93]Oh shit, what are we doing?
[22:10.71]Uh... Oh my god, I don't know what I'm doing to him.
[22:18.66]Okay, stay there.
[22:24.16]Don't move.

[22:31.98]Oh, his jump is huge!
[22:33.46]I get it, okay.
[22:35.08]What about everybody else?
[22:35.84]Can I mutate you?
[22:39.74]Okay, that's what you're... I think it's a bigger jump for everybody.
[23:05.57]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[23:07.65]What do you mean?
[23:08.09]Am I wasting points?
[23:14.91]Am I giving everybody just a... I'm just making everybody... I'm just changing everybody's color.
[23:19.60]Okay, so we're good.
[23:23.96]Now we should be able to go... Should I jump something?
[23:26.96]Oh, I can jump this now.
[23:30.76]Don't come down here.
[23:31.30]Don't come down here.
[23:31.76]Don't come down here.
[23:32.18]Don't come down here.
[23:32.68]Don't come down here.
[23:33.26]Nobody come down here.
[23:34.86]Just leave me.
[23:41.61]Leave both of us.
[23:42.31]What the fuck?
[23:52.78]Wait, they're doing this on their own.
[23:54.94]Gain a genetic sample from any non-indigenous life form by mutating your genome hunters.
[23:59.68]If you find- Fuck, what did that say?
[24:01.04]Oh, we can just go this way.
[24:03.04]We're fine.
[24:03.54]Where's the other guy?
[24:09.73]Oh, there he is.
[24:10.11]Okay, we're good.
[24:16.14]I hope we can start growing, like, weird toes and stuff.
[24:23.49]The other guy actually made the jump?
[24:26.69]Wait, what the hell?
[24:27.59]Didn't we already do this?
[24:31.29]We all have to get together for this.
[24:32.31]Help.

[24:45.60]Wait.
[24:49.26]I can't make this fucking... Nobody can make this jump.
[24:51.08]No, we can't make the jump.
[24:53.16]I need to mutate more to get more jump.
[24:56.67]Okay, good.
[25:02.57]Is that working?
[25:09.45]This is the only spot where I can make this jump, isn't it?
[25:21.21]I don't get it.
[25:21.87]I don't get it either.
[25:22.59]I think that's doing it, right?
[25:38.71]Why are you playing it?
[25:39.71]Because it seems like it's fun.
[25:41.01]Hold on.
[25:41.33]I get it.

[37:58.61]What else?
[38:00.17]Even more claws.
[38:02.61]What else?
[38:03.80]Bigger claws as big as your arms.
[38:05.86]What else?
[38:07.20]Do it again.
[38:08.58]What else?
[38:08.96]Do it again.
[38:09.32]Should I be doing this?
[38:15.16]I'm gonna kill this motherfucker now.
[38:18.09]Get all remaining genohunters to pick up point.
[38:20.65]Alright, what do you have now?
[38:22.15]I don't want you with claws.
[38:25.13]I want you with speed.
[38:28.37]Now he's too powerful.
[38:30.34]That's fine.
[38:32.10]I can definitely break those rocks now.
[38:38.26]What's this?
[38:44.68]Yeah, I'm the one dickhead in your friend group that has thunder fury.
[38:48.46]And the rest of you just get to walk around with them.
[38:51.66]It becomes exhausting to play with this person because they kill everything in one hit.
[38:54.82]And you just... You use it as a time for you to hang out with them.
[38:59.45]You're not playing well.
[39:01.01]You're just watching somebody else play while you walk around.
[39:02.77]Here we go.
[39:07.77]And there's random encounters?
[39:10.42]Sign me up!
[39:17.23]Do I give everybody claws?
[39:18.27]Alright, I need to actually build a good team here.
[39:26.60]We need tank, DPS, healer, and... Friend of healer.
[39:34.06]Okay, good.
[39:40.16]You stay that way.
[39:41.28]I don't want you to change.
[39:45.78]This is the fast guy, right?
[39:48.10]We don't want claws on fast guy.
[39:49.34]We want fast guy to be fast guy.
[39:53.28]That's pretty fast.
[39:54.46]We don't need claws on you, because look, you can be the one that runs around.
[39:56.89]Fast.
[39:58.29]What about you?
[40:00.27]Wait, I'm doing this all wrong.
[40:01.89]The heavy should have heavy weapons.
[40:03.79]Alright, we'll give you heavy weapons too.
[40:05.63]We'll have two DPS.
[40:09.29]Yeah.
[40:10.21]This guy is the guy that's supposed to be doing all the damage.
[40:11.83]Alright, that's good, that's good, that's good.
[40:12.83]Leave him alone.
[40:16.35]It's two different claws.
[40:17.47]Faster or more damage.
[40:18.89]Yeah, good.
[40:20.67]Now what about you?
[40:23.79]This is intelligence guy, right?
[40:27.22]He's growing leaves out of his body.
[40:28.36]Alright, we're going to make intelligence guy.
[40:31.46]We'll give him some damage.
[40:35.04]And give him some speed.
[40:37.65]Alright, let's go.
[40:41.49]He's literally making shit up.
[40:45.97]I don't see at least a hundred PogChamps from that.
[40:47.53]That was fucking awesome.
[40:56.20]Oh, flank!
[41:00.44]Hey, friend of healer, can you make me 20 waters?
[41:04.32]Oh, sure!
[41:05.89]Thanks.
[41:13.97]Now what?
[41:21.09]Oh, we're up top now.

[41:22.71]Alright, what is the moment?
[41:25.83]What is the... Oh.

[41:30.32]It's down there?
[41:30.86]I don't want to go down here if I'm not supposed to be... Yep, this is it.
[41:45.51]God, I love the two FPS boxes.
[41:51.80]I guess that they serve a purpose.
[41:54.09]But that purpose is a little weird because... How... Shouldn't I be able to toggle that?
[42:01.97]What does one do?
[42:02.73]Don't you think this is something that's an interesting thing to toggle and not something that's on the screen all day?
[42:13.22]Playing WoW again on stream.
[42:18.00]We can all make that jump.
[42:23.59]Where's Red?

[44:50.70]Fucking idiots, I have two!
[44:52.03]We're coming!
[44:54.47]We're on our way!
[44:56.45]And I'm gonna die, like, I'm gonna die here.
[44:57.57]And that's fine.
[44:58.87]I'll fucking take it up with the guild leader later.
[45:00.63]This is like, this is the type of shit, this is why we can't get the fucking top 100.
[45:05.07]It's like Larry over there gets fucking stuck in the water, and that's okay.
[45:07.45]Whatever.
[45:08.53]That's fine, I did it myself.
[45:10.32]I did it myself.
[45:10.86]Anybody else getting hungry?
[45:25.88]What do you mean it's Alvin?
[45:32.90]It's Alvin?
[45:34.30]How is it?
[45:34.82]Why are they all down here?
[45:36.87]Where's four?
[45:38.71]Wait, why do we?
[45:39.89]It's Alvin.
[45:40.45]Wait.
[45:40.83]It's not supposed to be like a. It's the chipmunks.
[45:49.66]It wasn't supposed to be.
[45:52.95]Wait, it's... What does it sound like?
[45:56.29]It's supposed to just be like lower pitch.
[46:00.85]Alvin and the E3 monks.
[46:20.44]Okay, I forget who is who.
[46:26.26]It's not supposed to be Alvin and the E3 monks.
[46:31.25]Yeah, I fixed it.
[46:33.93]Did I fix it?
[46:38.14]Why does somebody have a shitload of reverb on that?
[46:50.01]Guys, I'm gonna be late for dinner.
[46:52.83]I have to go.
[46:54.48]Dude, can you fucking get a better mic?
[46:56.50]It sucks so bad.
[46:58.66]None of us here like to bring it up, but I'm gonna bring it up.
[47:01.72]Because it's fucking annoying.
[47:06.10]Yeah, it is kind of annoying.
[47:08.12]Did I make it better?
[47:12.69]Does it sound better?
[47:15.85]No, dude, it sounds even fucking worse.
[47:18.28]It's like you ripped it out and put it back in.
[47:19.72]You know what?
[47:20.00]Just don't even talk.
[47:20.50]Mute yourself.
[47:20.88]Just mute.
[47:22.42]Yeah, dude, just mute until you can get it figured out.
[47:25.19]Yeah, dude, just mute.
[47:26.11]There's no reason to be like that.
[47:28.57]Okay, sorry.
[47:29.29]I'll mute.
[47:29.79]I'll mute.
[47:30.15]Okay, let's move out, soldiers.
[47:43.85]This is fucking toxic.
[47:50.23]Also, guys, remember, if you roll need on anything, you're gonna get kicked out.
[47:54.58]It's on Master Looter.
[47:57.54]If anyone wants to roll on something, if you roll need for something, you're gonna be using your DKP.
[48:02.50]And I run this guild, and I am at every single event.
[48:05.70]So I have, like, 50,000 DKP.
[48:07.90]What a great system this was.
[48:09.00]I can get anything I want.
[48:10.40]Whenever I want.
[48:11.98]No matter what it is.
[48:16.09]I have five TKP.
[48:17.63]Do I get anything?
[48:18.49]Do I get anything?
[48:20.47]Do I get anything?
[48:21.57]Can I get some armor?
[48:24.45]Yeah, dude.
[48:25.03]We'll have somebody in the guild craft you something, man.
[48:29.42]They'll craft it for you.
[48:31.02]It's like tier one dog shit, but you know, whatever.
[48:32.72]Who cares?
[48:38.54]I keep falling off and they keep following me to my death.
[48:41.78]Kill this thing!
[48:42.92]Come on, kill it!
[48:53.22]Toxic, toxic, toxic.
[48:55.26]Toxic, toxic, toxic.
[49:03.55]Hey, can you guys wait up?
[49:04.91]I got lost back here.
[49:09.87]Every fucking time, seriously, dude.
[49:11.51]Every fucking time.
[49:13.39]Puck this shit out or fucking leave.
[49:15.21]Just leave the guild if you can't fucking handle it.
[49:17.47]Well, I didn't- I'm just like- I'm busy.
[49:19.91]Yeah, you're busy.
[49:20.31]You're busy.
[49:20.55]You can't do anything.
[49:21.11]You fucking- You're absolutely worthless.
[49:23.05]I'm sick of this shit.
[49:25.79]Can we stop fighting, please?
[49:26.79]It's not even- It's- It's- Stop fighting.
[49:28.28]Stop fighting.
[49:28.74]He said to you, you fucking idiot.
[49:32.36]And I'm sick of him being in this guild.
[49:33.82]He always brings us down.
[49:34.84]He always is too slow.
[49:36.16]And he always is causing problems.
[49:38.72]I'm not going to be in a guild with them anymore.
[49:41.00]What the fuck, dude?
[49:42.22]Chill the fuck out.
[49:43.90]I'm not going to chill the fuck out because I'm sick of you having to need shit and have to come up through the rankings here to get gear that I could use.
[49:53.02]And my DPS meter is like fucking 10 times higher than you.
[49:58.35]Let me talk.
[50:02.77]This is getting too real.
[50:08.26]It's too real.
[50:17.40]I have to beat the mission first.
[50:19.22]That's important.
[50:29.19]That's a 50 DKP mine.
[50:30.77]That's an old one.
[50:31.79]That's old.
[50:33.35]This is a toxic fucking guild.
[50:39.04]Yeah, we'll deal with it.
[50:41.10]You signed up, you went through the vigorous application process, didn't you?
[50:45.78]And what did you say?
[50:48.54]What did you say?
[50:49.26]No, tell me, tell me what you said.
[50:53.94]Look, we all went through the process.
[50:55.44]Don't be a dick to him just because... Look, we all knew that it was going to be 10 hours a day.
[51:01.25]We have shit to do, man.
[51:02.31]It can't just be all about World of Warcraft.
[51:04.57]Or, I mean, not that.
[51:05.59]What are we playing right now?
[51:06.61]What's this fucking MMO?
[51:08.51]Evolver, dude.
[51:09.31]It's not just all about Evolver.
[51:11.77]You make everything all about Evolver and it's actually kind of irritating.
[51:16.49]It's not all about Evolver?
[51:18.67]What are you talking about?
[51:22.14]What are all of you talking about?
[51:22.94]You know what?
[51:24.04]All three of you.
[51:25.50]All three of you.
[51:26.22]One, two, three.
[51:27.58]Out of the fucking guild.
[51:29.19]Goodbye.
[51:30.23]I will find other people that will replace you that can actually pull more than 4K DPS.
[51:34.87]That's right, Jake.
[51:36.59]You can't fucking pull more than three and a half.
[51:41.67]I've had enough of this.
[51:44.49]Fuck you.
[51:46.53]Oh, shit.
[51:47.33]What?
[51:47.59]Oh, no.
[51:47.89]A PDP duel.
[51:48.51]No way.
[51:49.97]I'll show you how it is.
[51:52.73]Fucking dick!
[51:53.81]If you beat me, you get guild leader!
[51:55.01]How's that sound?
[51:56.81]I'm gonna do my best!
[51:58.01]I'm trying!
[52:00.35]Come on, Jake!
[52:01.51]You can do it!
[52:02.32]You can get him!
[52:04.22]Get him!
[52:05.86]He's an asshole!
[52:08.44]I think I'm gonna get beaten by some little worm recruit!
[52:12.30]Not gonna happen!
[52:16.22]Stupid idiot!
[52:16.91]I got you into this guild!
[52:17.83]Don't forget where you came from!
[52:18.93]Don't forget who got you into the guild!
[52:22.78]I don't care where you are.
[52:24.22]My voice may have changed, but it doesn't even matter.
[52:29.44]I don't think we can kill each other.
[52:31.04]I think, oh, yeah, right.
[52:32.41]We're in Shattrath City.
[52:35.97]We can't hurt each other.
[52:36.89]That's what I thought.
[52:56.31]I just want to beat the mission for the love of God.
[53:14.26]We've lost him for good this time.
[53:20.66]Wait, everybody already made the jump, and I just... What have you seen?
[53:25.44]I'm the guild leader.
[53:27.20]You follow me.
[53:27.82]I don't follow anybody else.
[53:30.70]I'm fucking losing my mind.
[53:31.64]I have to beat this.
[53:35.08]That's a Wailing Caverns jump.
[53:38.47]I just have to get the jump.
[53:41.51]I just have to get the jump.
[53:42.31]Alright, I'm going to make this jump.
[53:43.95]If I do not make this jump this time, I'm going to gift 100 subs.
[53:47.03]I swear to God.
[53:49.18]I'm going to gift 100 subs if I don't get it this time.
[53:52.08]Dude, that's kind of a lot of subs.
[53:53.34]Are you sure you want to do that?
[53:55.76]Uh, shit.
[53:57.84]Dude, that's kind of... Dude, that's kind of a lot of subs.
[54:00.46]Are you sure that you want to do that?
[54:02.52]I am sure.
[54:03.48]Thank you, Jake.
[54:04.56]I am absolutely sure.
[54:05.38]No more... Give me the fast.
[54:17.49]Give me the fast guy.
[54:29.02]Give me the guild leader, he'll do it.
[54:30.58]Okay, we're good.
[54:34.78]I made it.
[54:35.34]Okay.
[54:35.93]I don't have to gift a thousand subs.
[54:38.69]Whatever the hell it was.
[54:51.60]Oh, look who didn't make the jump.
[54:53.52]Look who didn't make the jump after all that.
[54:57.99]Shut up, Jake.
[54:59.43]I mean, Bob.
[55:01.93]Look who didn't make the fucking jump.
[55:04.01]And there he is, keeping us up again.
[55:05.91]Take your time, by all means, Jake.
[55:07.63]Jake, I'm trying.
[55:11.43]I just got the game two days ago.
[55:17.35]See, I can do it.
[55:19.69]Yo, yo, yo, yo, yeah.
[55:20.89]Oh, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[55:23.39]Give it to him, everybody.
[55:25.92]Un-fucking-believable.
[55:36.35]Anybody else not care that he died?
[55:42.27]Not really.
[55:42.81]He was kind of a terrible person.
[55:44.61]Yeah, he sucked.
[55:49.51]He sucked big time.
[55:50.39]Jake, why don't you lead us from now on?
[55:57.86]Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
[55:58.82]Are we... Me?
[56:02.84]Me?
[56:03.52]I... I... Okay, I'll try.
[56:09.94]Ready?
[56:10.71]Jump!
[56:12.27]You guys can do it.
[56:12.99]Come on.
[56:16.37]You can do it.
[56:24.23]You know, maybe I should leave for now, and then maybe eventually you can take over.
[56:28.51]When you get, you know, your bearings and everything, and everything, you're good to go.
[56:39.49]Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
[56:47.10]Okay, let's go.
[56:52.14]The streamer doesn't have to gift 100 subs, because he made it to the point that he got to.
[56:55.68]I'm watching the same stream as you guys.
[57:01.16]That doesn't count.
[57:01.92]I don't have to give a hundred subs.
[57:03.97]What?
[57:04.19]Because I fell off?
[57:05.25]No.
[57:05.73]Falling off is not... I didn't try to go for a jump.
[57:10.45]I said if I didn't make the jump, then I would gift a hundred subs.
[57:14.49]Not if I fell down backwards off the cliff.
[57:16.97]That's not... That's... I don't have to do that.
[57:26.20]That's a scam.
[57:27.70]No.
[57:27.92]I said if I fall off...
[57:30.12]No, shit!
[57:31.02]I said if I jump!
[57:32.54]Give me the clip.
[57:37.39]Jake is still stuck down there.
[57:39.65]That's fine print.
[57:42.53]That's not scam.
[57:43.29]No, I made the jump and then that was over.
[57:46.55]He's scamming.
[57:53.27]Technically... technically... I haven't even saved the game.
[58:01.04]Not like copyright.
[58:01.82]Okay, there we go.
[58:13.17]Stop watching this scammer.
[58:14.73]Ugh.
[58:33.89]Hold on.
[58:34.47]Hold on to your seats, everybody.
[58:36.25]Hold on.
[58:41.15]I'll meet you halfway at 50.
[58:43.05]Because I fell.
[58:43.65]I didn't jump.
[58:44.65]How's that sound?
[58:48.03]I'll meet you halfway.
[58:51.47]I'll meet you halfway.
[58:52.03]I fell.
[58:52.49]I didn't jump.
[58:52.93]I fell back.
[58:53.45]I'll meet you halfway.
[58:54.49]Deal?
[58:54.99]Deal.
[58:55.43]Deal.
[58:55.65]Is that a deal?
[58:56.09]75 is not halfway.
[59:05.03]Okay, let me do this.
[59:05.81]I have to like... Am I logged in?
[59:18.02]There is a... There is... What was that?
[59:20.50]That's YouTuber kind of days.
[59:22.76]There is... Okay, there is a mature audience warning at the beginning of this.
[59:26.04]You guys have been lying to me for like a year.
[59:30.05]Non-descript civilian making up my subs that I'm not giving.
[59:34.61]Alright, gift a sub, let's go.
[59:37.29]I'll meet you at 50.
[59:37.79]I didn't, I technically, I fell backwards, I didn't jump.
[59:43.78]Come on, Gwen.
[59:56.77]There it is.
[59:57.03]Did you get it?
[59:57.33]Did you get one?
[59:58.63]Did you get one?
[59:59.15]Did you get one?
[60:04.41]50 community subs from Jerma985.
[60:07.45]Thanks, dude.
[60:09.19]I really appreciate that.
[60:10.19]5 from Pugatron, 5 from AjaxTheMediocre, 10 from AjaxTheMediocre, and then $105 from StormyChu.
[60:21.62]Holy shit.
[60:26.07]You made up the other 50.
[60:27.39]You don't have to do that.
[60:28.75]That's insane.
[60:30.51]200, like, that's a lot of money.
[60:33.35]You don't have to do that.
[60:34.25]That's 50 community subs from Inferno23.
[60:38.65]You don't gotta make up for me.
[60:41.88]That's a shitload of subs.
[60:42.84]That's a lot of money.
[60:45.60]You just gave the money back.
[60:51.70]A storm at you.
[60:52.40]Thanks for the $105, which is also insane.
[60:54.72]Now, I haven't laughed this much in a very long time.
[60:56.30]I'm glad I tuned into the stream.
[60:57.56]Thank you.
[60:59.48]Glad you're having a good time.
[61:01.27]Let's keep going.
[61:01.95]What do you say?
[61:02.63]Thanks for the extreme amount of money.
[61:05.21]Me and friends.
[61:06.95]He called us friends.
[61:07.57]He called them friends.
[61:08.39]He called them friends.
[61:09.15]He called us friends.
[61:11.71]It slipped.
[61:18.74]And thanks for the five, Jamie.
[61:19.76]Thanks for the five subs.
[61:20.54]Alright, let's go.
[61:28.77]Alright, who's still alive?
[61:33.13]Seriously, that's a ton of money.
[61:38.68]What is number four still doing?
[61:40.86]Can four not make the jump?
[61:47.00]What's the problem?
[61:51.08]Why are you still down here?
[61:55.96]Alright, I'm just gonna keep going.
[61:57.31]We're gonna go with the new leader here.
[61:59.45]What's this?
[61:59.87]Is this the pickup point?
[62:02.07]Oh, shit!
[62:02.61]This is the pickup point!
[62:08.81]Get on up there!
[62:16.43]You set them to hold position.
[62:17.83]I did?
[62:19.97]What button was that?
[62:29.93]Enter mutator.
[62:30.61]Group genos.
[62:32.49]Ungroup them.
[62:33.67]Select them.
[62:34.27]Command mode.
[62:35.54]Command all.
[62:37.24]Best geno.
[62:40.06]Alright.

[62:53.51]Oh.

[62:57.54]Regroup them?
[62:58.36]No, don't regroup to you.
[63:01.45]Alright, group.
[63:02.83]Regroup to me.
[63:03.43]Command.
[63:05.29]Group.
[63:06.85]Team.
[63:08.55]All to me.
[63:09.13]There they go.
[63:10.31]Alright, nice.
[63:15.03]What is best Geno?
[63:24.88]Man, hurry up, get over here.
[63:27.21]Come on Jake, let's go.
[63:32.42]I'll take control.
[63:57.32]Come on, just go.
[63:59.12]Go!
[63:59.74]I almost didn't make it!
[64:07.45]Get to the checkpoint, hurry!
[64:08.91]Alright, we made it.
[64:13.09]F10.
[64:13.95]We only lost one.
[64:19.47]Mission status completed.
[64:20.47]Objectives.
[64:20.95]Do them all.
[64:22.33]Killed 65%.
[64:23.63]Killed 76%.
[64:25.61]We got jump, claw, and speed.
[64:28.11]New genes.
[64:30.25]Ooh.
[64:31.19]Land number two.
[64:36.37]No boss.
[64:36.81]There is a boss.
[64:39.07]We have to beat the first boss.
[64:40.03]I'm not moving on until we beat the first boss.
[64:42.96]Okay.
[64:43.22]Well, ResidentSleeper, whatever.
[64:44.10]Okay.
[65:17.44]Alright.
[65:18.86]Obtain type 1 explosive plant spore.
[65:23.88]Who's back?
[65:25.40]The dick.
[65:29.67]Uh-oh.
[65:33.63]That means there's probably going to be a T-Rex behind them chasing them.
[65:35.78]Yep, I knew it.
[65:36.46]Alright, get in.
[65:38.49]Get in!
[65:39.61]Get out!
[65:40.29]Get out, get out, get out, get out.
[65:41.28]Alright, get in.
[65:53.37]Nice DPS.
[65:56.37]Alright, we're gonna use the strong one.
[66:02.07]Big Kid Hulk.
[66:04.19]That name doesn't make any sense anymore, does it?
[66:11.94]What the hell is that?
[66:12.86]Is there machine guns?
[66:19.26]Okay, there's machine guns.
[66:24.13]Alright, let's take a look at the mutating.
[66:30.93]I can do more power and more speed, or more jump and more power.
[66:34.86]More power and more speed, always.
[66:36.28]I can do another one.
[66:39.43]Alright, keep that the way it is.
[66:40.89]What about you?
[66:44.59]More power, more jump, or more jump, more speed?
[66:47.95]More power, more jump.
[66:53.67]Your speed only.
[66:55.03]We got power, or just even more speed?
[66:57.54]Even more speed.
[66:59.42]Can I do even more speed?
[67:01.26]Even more speed.
[67:03.26]What about you?
[67:06.48]I feel like you've been pretty neglected.
[67:07.74]What can you do?
[67:10.68]Is this damage?
[67:12.08]Damage and speed?
[67:12.88]Sure.
[67:15.56]Good.
[67:15.84]Yeah, that's fine.
[67:17.65]Alright, let's go.
[67:21.31]Use speed so you can get this done.
[67:29.53]Come on!
[67:39.57]Oh!
[67:44.47]Save spot right here.
[67:45.21]Get up here.
[67:45.55]More evolve.
[67:55.83]Don't fall off.
[67:58.32]Alright, we're good.
[67:59.36]Keep going.
[67:59.72]Everyone with me?
[68:04.72]You're doing Dexville.
[68:05.92]Is it boss time?
[68:06.74]I don't know.
[68:07.42]Maybe.
[68:07.56]Maybe.
[68:09.30]Watch it.
[68:09.56]Watch it.
[68:09.76]Don't go in close.
[68:11.86]Stay over here.
[68:12.36]Come over here and stay.
[68:14.36]Stay.
[68:21.20]I thought T was stay.
[68:27.17]Is somebody dead?
[68:29.47]Come on.
[68:30.17]You two idiots.
[68:30.97]What are you doing?
[68:34.11]Go.
[68:34.43]Make your way through it, please.
[68:40.92]Alright, here comes one.
[68:42.86]He's still having trouble.
[68:43.64]Whatever.
[68:44.72]Alright.
[68:45.16]How do I make them- T. T!
[68:49.68]T and S for stay.
[68:53.04]One is having trouble.
[68:53.86]Alright.
[68:55.24]What's up?
[68:57.32]Fighting down there.
[68:57.86]Okay.
[68:58.20]I'm gonna go to one.
[68:58.82]No, no, no!
[68:59.93]Do not follow one.
[69:04.15]Don't follow one.
[69:05.03]Are you following one?
[69:06.01]You're not supposed to be.
[69:07.39]Oh, fuck him.
[69:07.95]Who cares?
[69:10.82]Wait.
[69:11.30]Okay, good.
[69:21.41]Wait, none of them have jump.
[69:24.07]I hope they can make this.
[69:29.27]Finally, you made it.
[69:30.25]Took you long enough.
[69:34.01]Alright, who's got the biggest claws?
[69:37.23]Great.
[69:39.86]Alright, how do I get people to stay?
[69:41.30]I want you to come over here and stay here.
[69:44.56]What's the stay command?
[69:59.07]Okay.
[70:00.21]Group nearby genos.
[70:01.81]Group all genos.
[70:03.87]Ungroup them is H. Command mode is Tab.
[70:08.11]Command all genos.
[70:13.05]B?
[70:13.93]Team chat.
[70:15.35]That's chat.
[70:16.07]What are you talking about?
[70:17.92]It's H. Yeah, okay.
[70:22.28]Ready?
[70:22.50]Let's go.
[70:32.07]Alright, now... One at a time.
[70:35.19]Don't... Oh, fuck.
[70:36.51]Take him into the electrocution room.
[70:47.14]Don't get yourself killed.
[70:48.80]Back it up.
[70:49.62]Back it up.
[70:50.00]Back it up.
[70:50.30]Just go.
[70:50.60]Go.
[70:50.76]Go.
[70:50.98]Eat.
[70:51.16]Eat.
[70:51.34]Eat.
[70:51.50]Eat.
[70:51.70]Eat.
[70:51.86]Eat.
[70:52.14]Go.
[70:52.48]Go.
[70:52.66]Go.
[70:52.80]Go.
[70:52.98]Go.
[70:53.20]Eat.
[70:53.36]Eat.
[70:53.52]Eat.
[70:53.68]Eat.
[70:53.86]Eat.
[70:54.06]And go.
[70:54.38]Is that an egg?
[70:58.68]Can I pick this egg up?
[70:59.38]What's it doing?
[71:01.77]Is it healing me?
[71:04.97]I think it's a heal.
[71:12.37]No, this is the explosive.
[71:13.17]How do I get it?
[71:13.67]How do I pick it up?
[71:15.81]Okay, it's R. Obtain type 2 explosive.
[71:23.66]Oh, shit.
[71:25.54]Wait, can I pick up these little guys?
[71:28.25]No.
[71:28.43]Alright, we have to go back through here.
[71:29.65]Is this a Dreamcast game?
[71:32.33]Yeah.
[71:43.37]is quite a lot actually.
[71:49.91]Well, we're going to lose the leader again.
[71:51.33]Dreamcast fucking sucks.
[71:55.71]Laughing my ass off.
[71:57.39]Favorite comment ever.
[72:05.18]I think I can level up again.
[72:11.17]Chuck E. Cheese is streaming Fall Guys.
[72:13.31]Yeah, I know, I know.
[72:14.32]It's a guy in a Chuck E. Look, you had my attention at first when you said it was Chuck E. Cheese, but it's not the 3D animated Chuck E. Cheese.
[72:21.34]It's a guy in a Chuck E. Cheese costume opening his mouth every so often.
[72:26.67]Like, if it was the 3D animated Chuck E. Cheese and he had, like, a guy talking through him and stuff...
[72:41.50]VTuber Chuck... VTuber Chuck E. Cheese.
[72:52.18]Kill this thing.
[72:54.98]I need... We need more damage.
[72:58.36]This is ridiculous.
[73:00.08]Ridiculous.
[73:02.12]They're just eating the explosions.
[73:06.22]Just back away when they get like that.
[73:08.72]Okay.
[73:09.18]I gotta level up.
[73:10.34]Let's go with one.
[73:12.11]What do you got?
[73:14.97]This is new.
[73:15.79]I don't know if that is.
[73:16.57]Okay, this game just got cool.
[73:19.07]This is becoming a cool game now.
[73:20.04]I can breathe fire out of my mouth.
[73:23.04]Yeah.
[73:23.88]Oh, I'll take it.
[73:25.32]Okay.
[73:29.44]What about new?
[73:30.77]New 2.
[73:32.75]Shit, is that?
[73:33.67]Okay, no.
[73:34.11]Okay.
[73:34.61]Oh, you can do them all.
[73:35.57]I don't have to get out of the menu.
[73:39.70]What's this one?
[73:40.34]Is this fire?
[73:43.51]What is that?
[73:44.35]That's not fire.
[73:50.93]It is fire.
[73:52.47]Damage.
[73:54.61]Damage.
[73:57.09]Well, I don't want two people doing fire.
[73:58.53]Alright, you don't do that.
[73:59.45]Don't do that.
[73:59.81]Do something else.
[74:00.73]Uh-oh.
[74:06.99]Uh, give more jump.
[74:08.15]Oh, this guy's fucked.
[74:09.33]Whatever.
[74:11.87]Who breathes fire?
[74:16.01]Where's the fire breather?
[74:27.52]Back up!
[74:34.49]How do I breathe fire?
[74:39.50]Oh, it's... Okay, there you go.
[74:40.74]You have to select two.
[74:41.68]Alright, does it use mana?
[74:47.02]Alright, that's awesome.
[74:48.56]That's awesome.
[74:53.25]By the way... Holy shit, is this too loud?
[74:58.41]Why did nobody tell me this?
[74:59.37]It's still too loud.
[75:05.32]I can finally hear myself think.
[75:09.54]Okay.
[75:10.94]Go in.
[75:12.66]I can't wait to get the first boss.
[75:15.24]Fire versus fire.
[75:16.40]I can burn the leaves.
[75:17.18]That's cool.
[75:22.79]Raid Chuck E. Cheese right now?
[75:26.57]You want to raid Chuck E. Cheese right now and have my stream end?
[75:37.43]No, I'm still streaming.
[75:38.93]Alright, give me claws.
[75:52.80]Mirror.
[75:56.16]Please, they said they... No, I'm not having you guys gaslight me into telling me that Chuck E. Cheese said he was a big fan or something.
[76:03.52]No, that's not going to work.
[76:04.88]It's not going to work right now.
[76:14.30]Help!
[76:17.00]He did.
[76:18.94]Whatever.
[76:20.44]I used to love that place.
[76:21.22]I used to love bringing in my report card.
[76:25.63]And clearly there's like a bunch of C's and D's on it.
[76:28.41]But they didn't want anyone to feel bad so they gave you the same amount of tokens.
[76:32.11]As the person that came in with straight A's.
[76:36.72]If you showed a report card with like B's or higher.
[76:40.73]This is a real story.
[76:41.59]I'm about to give you guys some real story.
[76:43.23]I may have told this before, but I'm gonna tell it again.
[76:44.57]I don't care.
[76:46.43]When I was a little kid, we would go to Chuck E. Cheese, and my mother, God bless her, she would use my brother's and sister's report cards and try to get a package deal, because my report cards sucked.
[77:04.35]So it'd be like, well, take a look at this.
[77:06.39]I got this one.
[77:07.63]This kid's got straight A's.
[77:08.57]This kid's got straight A's and B's.
[77:10.65]I think that's okay.
[77:11.65]We deserve the tokens.
[77:14.19]And I was just sitting there with my finger in my nose.
[77:16.01]I don't do good in math.
[77:20.80]And it was like a 17-year-old behind the counter.
[77:23.92]He's not going to be like, well, he didn't have exactly 3.0.
[77:27.26]No, no, we think they care.
[77:28.94]No, of course not.
[77:36.14]Alright, let's get fast, Jerma.
[77:39.72]Where's Burn, Jerma?
[77:43.22]Burn, Jerma.
[77:46.14]I don't like the fire.
[77:46.76]These ones hate it.
[77:47.34]Anybody level up yet?
[77:58.79]Jerma, look.
[78:02.15]It would...
[78:06.06]Their kind hates ice and fire bulb.
[78:08.44]Three is about to die.
[78:09.44]Three's dead.
[78:11.74]In two hits.
[78:15.26]Does anybody have a heal?
[78:16.58]Where's the healer?
[78:18.44]Somebody help me.
[78:19.26]Save me.
[78:20.24]Save me!
[78:30.96]Where's two?
[78:32.02]Uh-oh, two's almost dead too.
[78:41.09]Remember, don't look.
[78:41.65]The link sucks.
[78:43.39]Does it?
[78:46.61]Anybody level up again?
[78:47.43]Yep.
[78:49.89]Alright, this is fire.
[78:52.70]Yeah, more fire.
[78:53.88]More firepower.
[78:55.50]More firepower.
[78:58.58]I don't know what the hell this person's doing, but should we give them the claws back?
[79:03.38]No, let's make this fast jumping guy.
[79:05.30]He doesn't do any damage.
[79:06.26]That makes sense.
[79:06.78]You need to have your one scout on the team, right?
[79:11.06]And this is... You're going to have to be DPS now.
[79:16.88]Because we lost the other guy.
[79:17.82]Alright, yeah.
[79:21.62]Four is DPS.
[79:25.04]Look, chat.
[79:26.20]There's no way I'm not going to cut my hand off.
[79:31.36]What the hell is this?
[79:38.07]What the hell is that?
[79:40.25]What's the point of writing that?
[79:43.13]Wait, didn't three have a... Combine type one and type two to create an explosive.
[79:49.64]Uh, where's the other egg?
[79:53.28]Wasn't three carrying the egg?
[79:54.70]Okay, thank god.
[79:56.42]Wait, combine the two of them.
[80:01.74]How do I combine the eggs?
[80:07.29]Maybe, I think it'll just do it automatically?
[80:14.02]Jerma, it's real.
[80:15.12]Alright, if this link is not at least a 7 or 8 out of 10, I'd be very upset with you guys.
[80:28.63]If this link is not at least a 7 out of 10, I have an issue.
[80:39.08]Yeah, I'm a fan of Jerma and love him.
[80:45.00]Is that doctor?
[80:45.61]Is that real?
[80:50.31]Is this a doctored image?
[80:51.51]Wait, is this actually the... Hold on, I gotta be careful here.
[80:55.60]Because... Let me show you.
[80:57.88]Let me show you.
[80:58.32]This is important.
[80:58.84]We have to discuss this.
[81:06.13]Did somebody just make this account and start broadcasting and then screen cap it or fake it?
[81:11.04]Or is this the real account?
[81:13.16]That's real?
[81:14.60]So this must mean I must get infinite tokens at every Chuck E. Cheese I ever go to.
[81:18.85]That has to be what it means.
[81:24.75]Can I just show this at any Chuck E. Cheese and be like, hey, yeah, I mean, you know, so act like it's a report card.
[81:32.32]Let's go.
[81:39.63]Of Jerma and Chuck E. Cheese crossover.
[81:42.47]I don't want... Okay.
[81:45.09]Chuck E. Cheese was awesome.
[81:47.04]It was such a fun place to be when you were a kid.
[81:50.26]Did I just say the tagline?
[81:51.60]No, it's where a kid can be a kid.
[81:54.04]Is that Toys R Us?
[81:56.76]What is it?
[81:57.14]What's the tagline?
[81:58.52]What?
[81:59.88]35-year-old man doing a collab with Chuck E. Cheese.
[82:05.05]Well, I don't know what we would do there.
[82:06.77]What does that mean?
[82:08.87]Wouldn't it be kind of a little weird?
[82:15.11]But how would you do that?
[82:20.59]I don't know if I... Look, unless I have a niece or a nephew with me at 35, I'm not going into Chuck E. Cheese, guys.
[82:33.66]I'm not going there for the pizza.
[82:35.12]No.
[82:37.26]What would I do?
[82:38.90]Why would I be in there?
[82:42.07]You're a loser.
[82:42.89]Why?
[82:43.25]Why not?
[82:46.53]Because it's where a kid can be a kid.
[82:49.27]Not where a 35-year-old man can be a 35-year-old man.
[82:54.37]We have enough bowling alleys, guys.
[83:03.84]But you're a kid inside.
[83:23.95]He drowned.
[83:26.05]Somebody just pushed my head under water.
[83:30.14]Shh, don't tell him, guys.
[83:31.42]I'm right behind him.
[83:32.08]He streams in a bathtub.
[83:33.80]He streams in a four-foot-deep pool.
[83:38.90]The computer's up on one of those weird rafts.
[83:42.20]I just dunked his ass.
[83:43.60]Can I get some plus twos?
[83:47.68]And I come back up.
[83:48.34]I'm like, oh, what the fuck, man?
[83:51.17]I wasn't ready for that.
[84:04.79]What is it?
[84:06.65]Where a kid can be a kid.
[84:08.93]What is that from?
[84:09.71]And why do these guys only have eyeballs now?
[84:13.65]PPS?
[84:14.21]Somebody just lost.
[84:28.91]Will you fight it?
[84:34.55]Chuck E. Cheese has blackjack now.
[84:36.60]Can you imagine a bunch of little kids sitting around playing blackjack?
[84:42.66]And the dealer would have to be a kid too.
[84:44.70]That's the only way that would work.
[84:45.88]That's the only way this works for me.
[84:51.98]Sorry, sir.
[84:53.16]You busted.
[84:54.90]Oh, no.
[84:55.90]Oh, man.
[84:59.75]21.
[85:00.19]I got blackjack.
[85:02.20]That's right, kids.
[85:03.18]Come on in to Chuck E. Cheese.
[85:07.06]We've got all your favorites.
[85:08.26]Slots, blackjack, poker.
[85:15.81]And they give Chuck E. Cheese like a big gold tooth.
[85:19.59]And he smiles.
[85:20.69]Come on in, kids.
[85:22.25]Ding.
[85:25.41]He leans in and is in his teeth.
[85:26.75]He pulls back his mouth and smiles deep.
[85:30.12]Ding.
[85:30.52]Right into the camera.
[85:34.70]This guy's not strong enough to break this.
[85:36.46]No, we need fire guy.
[85:46.83]In fact, fire guy's the only guy that's... good.
[85:57.11]Kids at a blackjack table.
[85:59.37]Things that you should never see.
[86:06.82]Wait, Chuck E. Cheese.
[86:07.98]What?
[86:08.52]Hold on.
[86:10.43]What does this say?
[86:12.45]I need to read this.
[86:14.01]Apparently this is... God damn it.
[86:16.77]It was all a fucking lie.
[86:18.73]It was all a lie.
[86:20.29]It was all a lie.
[86:21.39]It was all a lie.
[86:22.25]This is all a doctored lie.
[86:24.79]The whole thing.
[86:25.51]I got gas lit again.
[86:27.21]Again, it happens every stream.
[86:29.71]It happens every single stream.
[86:33.84]It's a fake account.
[86:34.64]It's a fake fucking account.
[86:35.58]You put the stupid fucking thing on here.
[86:37.60]Of course you did.
[86:38.28]Yeah.
[86:39.02]Chuck E. Cheese would never say something like that.
[86:44.39]Got my hopes up so bad.
[86:46.09]Chuck E. Cheese would never say that.
[86:49.59]I can't believe it.
[86:52.00]I knew it too because I'm like, yeah, you could have just like made this in 10 seconds.
[86:58.31]Chuck E. Cheese holds himself to a much higher standard than that.
[87:00.95]It's real.
[87:01.61]It's not real.
[87:02.53]Chuck E. Cheese does not ask me if I eat ass.
[87:05.61]Chuck E. Cheese did not say that.
[87:10.62]I am absolutely positive about this.
[87:13.02]If I've been positive of anything in my whole life, ever, it's that Chuck E. Cheese did not ask if you eat ass.
[87:22.57]There's not a chance.
[87:29.35]Like, you could tell me, look behind you, dude, there's an alien spaceship that's about to just drop fucking beams of light of death onto us.
[87:37.36]And I would be like, yeah, that's probably more, that would probably happen.
[87:40.50]That's accurate.
[87:41.14]I'm okay with that.
[87:41.58]That's fine.
[87:42.02]Sure.
[87:42.18]Whatever.
[87:42.96]That's more able to happen than a do you eat ass Chuck E. Cheese comment.
[87:57.41]God dammit, I can't believe it.
[87:58.81]I like, I didn't even believe it either.
[88:00.25]I believed it for like 10 seconds.
[88:12.68]Check the VOD.
[88:13.34]What, like he, on the VOD at some point you see him reach over to his keyboard and just start like enter.
[88:29.45]Wait, don't go that way.
[88:32.47]We still have fast guy?
[88:33.77]Yep.
[88:36.11]Oh, we have to blow something up.
[88:45.80]In chat.
[88:46.56]He's not in chat.
[88:48.86]He's busy playing Fall Guys and entertaining millions of children around the world.
[88:53.37]He didn't have time for me.
[88:55.27]I need closet.
[89:02.57]Back it up.
[89:05.17]What do you mean?
[89:09.51]I'm looking at the viewer list right now.
[89:11.10]And if this is another just total gaslight campaign, I'm going to be so mad.
[89:15.56]Users in chat.
[89:21.97]Okay, so, uh, Chuckle Morris and Chuck E. Cheese Real are the only two people in this chat that have Chuck in their name.
[89:30.40]So, wow, I can't believe it.
[89:33.04]Chuck E. Cheese Real is in here.
[89:34.72]That's unbelievable.
[89:36.88]That's so weird.
[89:40.58]Remember, if you put real at the end of your name, that has to be real.
[89:47.69]Alright, follow me.
[89:48.31]Oh!
[89:51.63]Can I revive three?
[89:52.95]Or is he dead the whole game?
[89:54.14]Guys, there's a... Stop running into that!
[90:07.85]There's a real Jerma985 in this chat.
[90:12.39]So... Yeah, that's easy to determine.
[90:23.90]Will you guys leave him alone?
[90:25.30]Can I destroy these?
[90:34.21]No.
[90:36.35]Alright, fast.
[90:40.97]Fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast, fast.
[90:50.57]DPS.
[90:50.73]I need to control the DPS.
[90:52.89]That's our only hope of victory at all.
[91:00.15]This game's actually kind of fun.
[91:01.91]I could see... Did you hear how crazy that Sybilus was?
[91:09.70]I just whistled to you.
[91:14.48]When I was like 14, I probably would have loved this.
[91:25.38]I'm gonna be a level up Toon.
[91:30.69]What Toon are you gonna be on?
[91:39.79]I never liked Toon.
[91:42.11]I like character.
[91:47.63]Get out of here.
[91:48.21]Out, out, out, out, out.
[91:48.93]Don't stand in that.
[91:49.91]Don't be stupid.
[91:59.94]Attention.
[92:00.66]Attention.
[92:04.68]What do you want?
[92:05.82]You've got it.
[92:07.62]You've got my attention.
[92:11.68]You have my attention.
[92:12.54]What is it?
[92:14.94]Actually here.
[92:20.94]Wait.
[92:21.72]Is that real?
[92:22.58]Is that a real name though?
[92:24.65]Chuck E. Cheese is here.
[92:30.80]What are you, what's, what is Chuck E. Cheese doing here?
[92:33.24]What have you guys, what did you guys do?
[92:34.44]Why'd you do this?
[92:36.94]Why?
[92:44.58]I, alright, let me make sure I, look, this is like a job, this is like a bigger than a job interview.
[92:50.50]Chuck E. Cheese is here.
[92:51.72]Fucking mustache hair, I gotta fix that.
[92:57.63]Hey, Mr. Cheese.
[93:00.03]I'm Jerma.
[93:01.73]You may have had some people come into your chat and just be all rambunctious and crazy.
[93:08.05]Sorry about that.
[93:08.67]I respect you and respect your establishment.
[93:11.16]I love what you do.
[93:11.88]I love your pizza, by the way.
[93:13.42]It's good.
[93:13.88]He left.
[93:19.48]I failed the interview.
[93:25.44]I should have turned the webcam on with funny whiskers on and put like eye shadow on and be like screeching into the camera.
[93:32.38]That would have been perfect.
[93:34.77]Idiot.
[93:44.61]Why you guys?
[93:45.85]Why?
[93:46.33]He's ve-
[93:56.49]It says high Jerma in the thing, but it's because you gave him $10 to do that.
[94:06.68]My eyes are going all over the place right now.
[94:08.50]You gave Chuck E. Cheese $10 for him to say that.
[94:17.99]He's typing in the chat.
[94:19.81]Am I going to VIP Chuck E. Cheese?
[94:23.17]This feels like the strangest day of my life.
[94:27.55]Doesn't this feel like that day that just shouldn't happen?
[94:29.50]This just shouldn't happen.
[94:32.06]Chuck E. Cheese.
[94:36.12]This is what happens in a dream.
[94:38.38]This is a dream scenario.
[94:43.51]I think I've had a dream like this where I VIP'd Hulk Hogan in the chat.
[94:48.97]And it was like, oh my god, Hulk Hogan's here, guys.
[94:55.30]I'm not modding Chuck E. Cheese.
[94:56.68]I don't know what he would do with that kind of power.
[95:08.32]Feels bad, man.
[95:18.44]Like I just fucking rip up from my bed.
[95:20.52]That's what happened right now.
[95:22.47]It didn't happen though.
[95:26.27]Sweat is pouring down my body.
[95:29.02]And I have somehow, I was in full clothing when I went to bed and I'm naked in the bed.
[95:34.36]Like just covered in water and sweating.
[95:41.68]Okay, so thanks Chuck E. Cheese for, what am I thanking him for?
[95:46.46]For like, for showing his presence?
[95:52.81]Thank you, Chuck E. Cheese, for even... I'm saying the name.
[95:56.34]I'm saying the name over and over again.
[96:01.12]I'm saying Chuck E. Cheese.
[96:02.12]I've said it like a thousand times in the last 40 minutes.
[96:07.78]Whatever you're doing, it's working.
[96:11.00]Whatever you're doing, it's working!
[96:12.64]His name is Charles.
[96:15.94]Chuck is short for Charles.
[96:24.01]You're a corporate.
[96:25.53]If you, okay, I'm sorry, but if you think Chuck E. Cheese is like corporate, it's an arcade where they serve fucking pizzas.
[96:34.01]It's like, that fucking corporation.
[96:38.15]Yeah, those corporations like Chuck E. Cheese.
[96:43.69]What?
[96:46.31]Yeah, we're talking about corporate fucking Amazon corporation that just, it's huge.
[96:53.56]Google, Apple, Chuck E. Cheese.
[96:58.81]You're going to get banned for life from Chuck E. Cheese.
[97:05.45]I'm not going to get banned for life from Chuck E. Cheese.
[97:10.79]You're swearing in front of Chuck E. Cheese.
[97:12.34]Chuck E. Cheese had to click on the yes, I am going to watch the mature audience stream.
[97:17.68]So this is not me.
[97:26.20]That means that Chuck E. Cheese is like 40.
[97:28.12]Or at least 18.
[97:29.54]So we got a game here.
[97:39.00]It's called Evolva.
[97:40.26]I'm not sure if you've ever heard of it before.
[97:42.51]I can't believe Chuck E. Cheese is playing Fall Guys.
[97:44.55]What a brilliant idea.
[97:49.63]That's like the smartest thing I've ever seen a company do.
[97:59.82]What do you mean company?
[98:00.78]I know.
[98:01.05]Okay, look.
[98:02.41]Yes.
[98:02.99]Alright.
[98:03.61]I'll play along.
[98:04.25]I'll play along.
[98:05.13]I'll play along.
[98:07.53]Wow, Mr. Cheese.
[98:08.65]I can't believe you.
[98:09.47]You're so good at fall, guys.
[98:13.11]You're simping for these people.
[98:19.97]Simping for Chuck E. Cheese?
[98:30.77]You want to... Q into him on Fall Guys.
[98:47.11]You want me to... Hold on a minute.
[98:49.51]I... Wake up.
[98:50.80]Wake up.
[98:51.28]Wake up.
[98:51.72]Wake up.
[98:52.16]Wake up.
[98:53.40]You want me to stream snipe Chuck E. Cheese in Fall Guys on stream?
[99:01.26]And they're, like, having fun with it.
[99:11.05]I've got to reduce the THC by at least two milligrams.
[99:14.89]I feel like this isn't even happening.
[99:18.25]This is, I'm like still playing the game right now.
[99:21.16]I'm just walking around in the game and like hitting shit and killing stuff and getting experience points.
[99:26.24]This is just going on somewhere in my head.
[99:28.38]And eventually I'm going to blink and I'm going to be playing the game and I'm going to be, the whole chat is going to be going, you alright?
[99:33.81]Is he okay?
[99:34.37]What's going on?
[99:34.95]Is he okay?
[99:35.41]What's wrong with him?
[99:36.03]Is he okay?
[99:38.57]This is what's happening right now.
[99:39.85]I'm sitting here like this.
[99:41.55]This is what you guys see.
[99:44.28]This is what you see.
[100:05.65]But that's not where it's going.
[100:07.71]Get me up.
[100:08.19]Somebody's got to pull me up.
[100:10.24]There's a shitload of enemies.
[100:25.91]Stay alive, stay alive.
[100:27.19]He ran, he's out?
[100:28.19]Fuck!
[100:42.14]Oh shit, he's dead.
[100:44.00]Level up, level up, level up, level up.
[100:47.23]Okay, give him extra power.
[100:51.63]Look at those claws.
[100:57.42]These claws are huge now.
[101:18.08]No, stop, stop, like, stop, okay, yeah, oh, look, look, Skittles is here now.
[101:24.10]Look, you don't have to, look, I get it, you're trying to make me feel, like, cool and feel good that every candy bar and, like, junk food cartoon kids company is following me.
[101:35.50]I know, and look, it's okay, we don't have to pretend.
[101:38.22]I know you're really trying to make me feel good about knowing that cartoons think I'm cool, I guess.
[101:48.40]I fucking lost.
[101:49.62]I'm so annoyed at this that I lost this.
[102:07.24]I don't even... Wait, I failed it.
[102:08.72]So now what?
[102:09.74]Oh my god, that's bad.
[102:11.16]When was the last time I saved the game?
[102:17.29]he just keeps coming in here writing feels bad man feels bad man how do we make him happy
[102:35.41]Alright.
[102:36.37]Alright, Chuck E. Cheese.
[102:37.97]I will take everything back, and I'll say, hey, you're the man.
[102:42.35]You're awesome, and I love Chuck E. Cheese, but you've got to put your hand behind one of the arcade cabinets and drag like this, and if your hand isn't black with dirt, then I will take back everything.
[102:59.94]You've got to go back behind one of the cabinets like this and go like this.
[103:05.53]If it's not like dead bugs and black and brown and stuff.
[103:10.01]If it doesn't look like that.
[103:15.73]It's just dirt and dust.
[103:18.39]What?
[103:18.63]Okay, dirt and... I didn't wake up.
[103:24.86]You're insulting him to his face.
[103:26.06]No, I'm not.
[103:29.34]Okay, you ready?
[103:35.64]I don't think we should do this.
[103:36.98]He's behind my monitor.
[103:52.43]Colleen!
[103:54.63]What?
[103:57.62]He's gone.
[103:59.02]I love Chuck E. Cheese.
[104:01.80]It was a different hand.
[104:06.46]What did he say?
[104:09.82]What did he say?
[104:10.58]He said something.
[104:15.28]Wait, he did it.
[104:17.19]He put his hand behind the thing.
[104:20.11]What does it look like?
[104:26.25]How is he here and playing Fall Guys?

[105:35.97]That's just Jerma Rumble.
[105:37.25]Well, now you're going to be in Jerma Rumble.
[105:38.67]You have to be now.
[105:40.63]You have to be.
[105:41.13]You're going to be in Jerma Rumble.
[105:44.91]I mean, your stats are going to be absolutely zero.
[105:47.07]But you're going to be in...
[105:50.39]Okay, those of you, I don't care if this whole thing got derailed.
[106:00.56]Those of you that are annoyed at brand, brand, oh, he's putting a brand in Jerma.
[106:09.01]Half of every character in Jerma Rumpel is a branded cereal character.
[106:15.15]They're all brands.
[106:18.32]Don't be surprised if you see the Oscar Mayer wieners show up in 2020.
[106:21.82]They're all brands.
[106:30.53]That's a sellout.
[106:35.89]Whoa, got something going on back here.
[106:38.41]Something going on back there.
[106:39.29]I need a haircut.
[106:42.09]No.
[106:44.83]You got to be in the rumble, though.
[106:47.16]But you're not going to be Chuck E. Cheese.
[106:48.30]You'll be like Rat Kid.
[106:52.18]I don't know.
[106:56.68]He wants to be in the Rumble.
[106:57.94]Wait, there's Chuck E. Cheese?
[107:01.09]You want to be part of the Rumble, Chuck E. Cheese?
[107:05.91]Can you imagine?
[107:07.07]Turbo Rumble 2020 brought to you by Chuck E. Cheese.
[107:12.31]I could sell it.
[107:14.57]I could sell it.
[107:18.30]I don't think they have any more money.
[107:19.58]They don't, right?
[107:23.73]I'm just trying to be real.
[107:33.63]What about the fruits?
[107:38.59]Actual sellout.
[107:41.72]I'm sorry, guys.
[107:44.36]If like Chuck E. Cheese wanted to sponsor a stream...
[107:49.30]That's like the most outrageous fucking thing I could ever imagine.
[107:54.42]Like that would be hysterical to me.
[107:58.72]But hold on.
[107:59.70]Let me just make sure I make this really clear.
[108:01.68]None of this is about any, there's no current partnership.
[108:04.64]I have no connection with Chuck E. Cheese at all.
[108:07.38]Zero.
[108:08.26]I have nothing to do with them.
[108:09.76]I'm stating my opinions on how much dirt is behind the machine.
[108:14.61]Okay?
[108:16.69]That's it.
[108:17.05]That's all this was.
[108:18.83]Is it just opinions?
[108:20.52]My thoughts and opinions based on no connection to any company.
[108:28.44]Guilty.
[108:29.58]Innocent.
[108:30.22]Innocent.
[108:30.80]Innocent.
[108:31.40]Innocent.
[108:32.20]Wake up, Jeremy.
[108:33.50]Wake up.
[108:34.56]It's time to get up.
[108:35.76]It's time to wake up.
[108:36.72]Wake up, Jeremy.
[108:37.58]Wake up.
[108:48.23]Shit, it's real!
[108:56.32]Holy shit, this guy's losing it.
[108:57.92]Hey!
[108:58.90]Ban that person.
[109:04.36]Please don't be that far away.
[109:05.40]I need to get to a boss.
[109:06.38]I have to get to a boss.
[109:10.70]Ban that person.
[109:14.51]Okay, we're okay.
[109:15.11]We have both the eggs.
[109:15.69]We're fine.
[109:16.11]Alright.
[109:16.53]Quick.
[109:16.93]Fast.
[109:21.62]All jokes aside, I really do.
[109:24.27]I like Chuck E. Cheese.
[109:25.91]It was a really fun place where a kid can be a kid.
[109:31.13]I spent countless hours in Chuck E. Cheese.
[109:33.65]I want to know the report card lore if I wasn't a Chuck E. Cheese fan, huh?
[109:39.51]Huh?
[109:41.83]It's not an ad.
[109:43.85]Guys, I haven't been to Chuck E. Cheese in at least 25 years.
[109:52.38]You're reading a script.
[110:00.60]Wait, what is this?
[110:01.16]Is this the first level?
[110:12.05]This is the first level, isn't it?
[110:14.23]Oh, God.
[110:16.37]I have to get to a boss.
[110:17.61]I'm not stopping this stream until I get to a boss.
[110:20.99]Level up, Omega Lull.
[110:22.21]Level 1 Larry.
[110:26.69]No, I was not 25 when I went to... I don't even know what the inside of a Chuck E. Cheese looks like.
[110:36.65]This is not level 2.
[110:37.85]I mean, level 1.
[110:38.33]This is level 2.
[110:38.73]You gotta get the two eggs and then... Why does this moment run in a circle?
[110:49.95]Oh, right, right, right, right.
[110:50.87]I remember this part.
[110:53.89]First boss is level five.
[110:55.15]Alright.
[110:55.63]Well, strap in.
[111:04.02]How did this person even get up here?
[111:15.09]Chuck E. Cheese Andy.
[111:18.31]Wouldn't it just be Chuck E. Cheese?
[111:20.29]Why do you have to have Andy?
[111:30.73]This person has to be able to defend himself.
[111:32.39]It's ridiculous.
[111:35.37]It feels like it was ages ago that we lost the big guy.
[111:37.57]And he's the guy that does the actual damage.
[111:39.77]Alright, let's go.
[111:40.37]Andy Cheese.
[111:43.47]Andy Cheese.
[111:48.08]because you think the Andy joke is funny.
[111:56.28]Well, I mean, it's... She's Andy.
[112:05.07]Alright, it's time for fire breath.
[112:11.79]Everybody get over here and stay back.
[112:13.19]Stop.
[112:17.77]I'm trying not to hurt everybody.
[112:20.74]Carl's Elbertson cheese.
[112:22.36]Alright, get in there.
[112:25.92]Fight.
[112:27.06]Fight!
[112:35.19]Save it.
[112:36.57]Let's quicksave so I can spam it.
[112:44.44]F5.
[112:48.21]F5, got it.
[112:52.39]Chuck E. Cheese has a better stream.
[112:56.99]Okay.
[113:00.24]Should I be sad about that?
[113:01.26]I'm going to cry on camera?
[113:04.72]I'm going to pull the camera up and start crying.
[113:08.64]Alright, this is where I was last time.
[113:18.11]I'm gonna evolve again after this.
[113:24.57]Put eyedrops in and just start crying.
[113:26.07]Why don't we just put eyedrops in and just have them running down my face in full facecam.
[113:38.44]And just be quote in the middle of like a sentence.
[113:44.14]So when people, I'll always be talking like this.
[113:47.82]We'll wait till at least a few people come in.
[113:49.87]Like, and I, I, I, I, I, I, I, yeah, and that's when I went there.
[113:56.51]I saw it, right?
[113:57.93]Like you go in the middle of a sentence.
[113:59.15]So when anybody comes in, it's not like you're waiting for them to come in for you to do the bit.
[114:03.49]You're in the middle of it.
[114:04.35]You're just talking.
[114:06.06]So if I sit here like this and I go, wait, wait, wait for somebody to come in.
[114:09.68]Wait for somebody new.
[114:13.81]Okay, so I'm crying.
[114:15.43]No, no, no.
[114:15.78]I'm crying and mid-life.
[114:18.58]And then somebody will get somebody.
[114:21.16]Yeah, because people will know it's an act.
[114:27.84]Fucking face.
[114:35.40]None of you guys know anything about acting, okay?
[114:47.55]Back it up, back it up.
[114:48.14]Don't... Don't do it.
[114:51.10]True.
[114:54.93]Don't stand next to it.
[114:58.13]Don't stand next to it, Tweedledee and Tweedledickhead.
[115:14.61]This is impossible!
[115:16.14]You can't even beat this level!
[115:18.08]What the fuck?!
[115:29.06]Give me that egg.
[115:31.74]We're gonna bomb it.
[115:33.00]Bomb it, bomb it, bomb it!
[115:34.60]Bomb this thing!
[115:35.92]How do we pull a bomb down?
[115:36.84]Plant the bomb!
[115:38.14]Alright, it's in there.
[115:41.71]Plant the bomb.
[115:45.04]Let the ball.
[115:48.12]Is it working?
[116:08.23]Just get into the thing.
[116:09.69]Who has it?
[116:10.89]Just run, run, run, run, run.
[116:12.55]Just don't even fight these things.
[116:13.61]There's a thousand of them.
[116:16.78]Oh, the minus twos.
[116:17.66]Yeah.
[116:22.36]Arming minus twos.
[116:23.30]That's what I do best.
[116:24.14]Okay, then bring... How do we explode this?
[116:33.26]How do we blow this up?
[116:40.42]them both in here.
[116:41.28]And then what?
[116:42.40]Is it supposed to explode?
[116:52.17]Combine type 1 and type 2.
[116:53.65]How the fuck do you combine them?
[116:56.35]Did I do it?
[117:15.12]Worst noise?
[117:15.78]Yeah.
[117:16.48]Does that count though?
[117:17.10]Because that was on purpose.
[117:20.10]That was as awful as I could make something be and sound on purpose.
[117:23.14]Does that count if it's on purpose?
[117:35.19]Alright, now just one needs to get in there.
[117:47.61]Get out!
[117:48.75]Get out!
[117:49.47]Get out!
[117:50.67]It's okay, somebody's alive.
[117:56.39]Run!
[117:56.91]Run!
[118:01.90]I won?
[118:04.06]I won?
[118:06.02]Alright, cool.
[118:08.38]Okay.
[118:12.54]Land number three.
[118:14.46]Almost to the boss.
[118:19.06]Okay, herd indigenous creatures to containment area.
[118:21.68]Defend these indigenous creatures from attack.
[118:24.48]Ensure that the population survives.
[118:27.24]Clear this region of enough parasite lifeforms to ensure reinfection does not occur.
[118:30.86]Is it going to be an escort mission?
[118:44.29]Herd indigenous creatures to containment area.
[118:48.14]Alright, let's go fast guy.
[118:58.13]Next game.
[119:00.91]I'm not done with this one.
[119:04.05]Where's this indigenous creature?
[119:09.35]Next game I'm gonna play is that, uh, game where you make money and you clean up, like, a space shuttle and you have to take junk and stuff, whatever it's called.
[119:17.20]It's got a long name that's hard to remember.
[119:18.88]What's it called?
[119:26.70]No, not Viscerclean.
[119:27.62]It's called something else.
[119:31.92]Hard Space Shipbreaker.
[119:33.46]Yes, that's the one.
[119:36.10]Yes, it's the one with, like, the Warcraft NPC name.
[119:57.32]Why do you only play games no one heard of?
[119:59.42]Uh... I played Fall Guys like... I played Fall Guys like three days ago!
[120:20.01]I like nostalgia.
[120:21.25]Oh, I just got a headshot.
[120:22.99]He got fucking sniped.
[120:29.10]Holy shit, that was bad.
[120:31.44]Okay, well, I don't really want to save it.
[120:33.40]What is 4 doing?
[120:46.05]What's the last new game I played?
[120:47.51]Okay, we hear this argument and I'd love to rebuttal this argument.
[120:51.95]It's like, why do you play old games that nobody likes?
[120:55.96]What's a new game that people like?
[120:57.20]You know, I could swing it that way.
[121:02.54]Okay, name me like a game that's come out in the last year that was like, wow, it's worth it.
[121:08.39]I can't think of one.
[121:17.34]Outer Wilds didn't come out this year.
[121:19.10]Did it?
[121:37.35]Everybody got destroyed.
[121:39.73]No, my Warcraft guild is dead.
[121:45.20]Wait, I can still make it to the indigenous creature.
[121:51.56]Give me some speed.
[121:52.14]Give me some speed.
[121:52.64]Give me some speed.
[121:55.28]What's that?
[121:55.52]It's like ice?
[121:56.00]I don't know what that is, but what is it?
[121:57.79]It looks cool.
[121:59.47]That's awesome.
[122:01.21]Speed.
[122:02.81]Speed.
[122:03.21]Okay, we're good.
[122:10.23]The gun?
[122:11.53]This game's cool.
[122:12.25]I guess I just don't want to give it a chance.
[122:19.28]Alright, where's this creature?
[122:20.22]What?
[122:23.98]Shit.
[122:30.70]Alright, we're going to play Spaceship Breaker, or whatever it's called.
[122:49.73]I actually enjoyed this, though.
[122:51.90]That was fun.
[122:52.60]It's a cool concept to... It was fun.
[122:57.48]I liked it.
[122:58.00]Let's play Hypnospace Ship Outlaw, whatever it is.
[123:04.60]Just in case, for some reason, I come back here.
[123:09.36]Wait, wouldn't Quick Save 2 be a dead screen?
[123:18.22]Why would I save it there?
[123:19.28]Does that make... Hold on.
[123:26.99]That is... Okay.
[123:33.05]I'm just going to go pee.
[123:33.97]I'll be right back.
[123:34.67]We'll play the ship game.
[123:36.43]Be right back.
