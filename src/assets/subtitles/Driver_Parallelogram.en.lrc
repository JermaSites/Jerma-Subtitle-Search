[01:20.19]Hello there.
[01:20.81]Did I scare you?
[01:29.27]We're going to do something a little different tonight.
[01:32.06]We're going to play Driver.
[01:33.10]This game probably sucks, but we're doing mystery games from now on.
[01:40.24]You know how it is.
[01:45.20]Mystery games.
[01:47.80]Let's hope it works, because it's an old game.
[01:49.84]Hey, Ronnie.
[02:00.78]Hey, all you guys.
[02:03.82]So, let's hope it's not too loud.
[02:05.31]Here we go.
[02:08.01]Okay.
[02:12.37]It has cool video game noises too, you hear?
[02:16.85]So this, I don't know what to expect.
[02:18.51]I just saw that it was like on sale.
[02:20.19]And I remember the Driver series being, I don't know, slightly fun.
[02:25.83]If I remember correctly.
[02:27.13]So I don't know.
[02:28.23]This could be one of maybe potential two or three mystery games.
[02:35.24]Let's give it a couple of seconds for people to get in.
[02:52.76]It is like so annoying, but it's a cool video game sound.
[03:01.64]Am I drinking?
[03:02.18]That's an espresso.
[03:04.52]Oh, look, it's espresso.
[03:07.78]Oh, wow.
[03:12.26]Totally mysterious.
[03:15.93]Is this a golfing game?
[03:18.25]I hope so.
[03:23.55]Donate 10 cheers?
[03:24.79]I don't have cheers.
[03:27.33]I'm not allowed in that beta yet.
[03:30.33]I think they only gave that to, like, some of the top streamers or top partners or something.
[03:37.08]Wait, what?
[03:38.54]What?
[03:39.96]Polish Toaster, thank you for four months.
[03:42.90]Welcome back.
[03:44.79]And you do a Kappa with two hands up.
[03:46.73]Wait, what?
[03:48.01]And we got another one for three months.
[03:49.53]Warty Fingle Blaster.
[03:52.63]They say, love you, baby.
[03:55.41]For three months, thanks a lot.
[04:06.72]What am I gonna play?
[04:09.84]The M&M Bargain Bin Beach Party?
[04:12.49]That whole video is what that entire game entails.
[04:15.45]Wait, what?
[04:19.63]Gyoro says, much love.
[04:21.61]By the way, could you tell me to stop being a slug man?
[04:23.78]I could use the motivation.
[04:26.04]Well, first of all, thank you for four months.
[04:28.22]And second of all, get up.
[04:33.14]Take me on your phone.
[04:34.12]Get your phone.
[04:34.99]Go to twitch.tv, the app.
[04:37.55]Bring me to the gym.
[04:39.65]And I'll just be like, one.
[04:42.16]Two.
[04:43.00]Give me one more.
[04:43.68]Three.
[04:44.34]Two more.
[04:44.92]Four.
[04:46.02]Five.
[04:46.64]You can do this, kid.
[04:47.66]You can do this.
[04:48.32]And then you'll get like that fucking fourth and sixth one, you know?
[04:53.58]Alright, let's go.
[04:54.72]I have no idea what the hell's gonna happen in this game, but we're gonna do a new game.
[04:59.03]Uh, sure.
[05:03.09]Uh... Jack.
[05:07.09]No, Jack.
[05:08.63]Jack be quick.
[05:13.37]Alright, let's do it.
[05:17.00]I thought that was the cutscene.
[05:19.94]That was a good start.
[05:30.42]New York in 78 was the coolest place on the planet.
[05:33.78]Everyone was either finding themselves having a party or getting laid.
[05:38.77]What the fuck is this?
[05:40.77]I was new to the Big Apple.
[05:42.21]Just a country boy looking to make good.
[05:44.35]But a few weeks and it felt like home.
[05:46.77]I knew every street, every avenue, every blind alley.
[05:49.65]This is David Bowie.
[05:50.79]I was 18 years old and growing up as fast as I could.
[05:54.30]I had a room up in Hunts Point over Ray's Auto Store.
[05:59.79]This is fucking... I had work.
[06:01.73]Doing a little debt collection for the Carlotti brothers.
[06:04.59]Or knocking out liquor stores.
[06:06.47]And if I needed more, all I had to do was head down to one of Joe's diners and take money off the racer boys.
[06:12.17]Or maybe hit one of the circuits.
[06:14.06]From New Jersey to Queens.
[06:15.12]They're doing way too many line cuts.
[06:18.72]My backyard.
[06:21.78]This looks like shit, by the way.
[06:27.36]The best part about that was the David Bowie music.
[06:37.76]This is so loud.
[06:39.84]What are the controls?
[06:42.44]Oh wait, we're outside the liquor store.
[06:44.78]I'm gonna rob the liquor store.
[06:47.88]What did I do?
[06:48.34]Cause I robbed the liquor store.
[06:49.87]Alright, let's go.
[06:50.31]Yeah.
[07:07.69]Alright, we're gonna move.
[07:10.17]I gotta listen to my- I'm the driver.
[07:13.16]Let's get out of here.
[07:14.38]Fuck, I wanna take control of the game.
[07:17.50]Oh, now we're in the actual game.
[07:25.70]I can already tell I'm gonna love this game.
[07:30.48]What the fuck is going on?
[07:36.63]Can I please play?
[07:39.71]Oh, here's some more copyright music.
[07:45.87]Drop me at Harlem.
[07:52.68]What?
[07:52.86]I get to drive?
[07:54.72]One way or another, I'm gonna find ya.
[07:59.86]I'm gonna hit that
[08:01.31]I didn't think he was gonna do it.
[08:08.94]I don't know where I'm going.
[08:12.78]I just heard an explosion behind me.
[08:23.72]I heard an explosion.
[08:29.56]Can I get out of the car?
[08:31.12]How do you get out?
[08:38.22]No!
[08:38.44]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[08:42.82]Sorry, sorry.
[08:45.18]Make your own soundtrack.
[08:48.42]I'm not gonna get this whole stream muted.
[08:51.85]Hold on, hold on, wait, wait, just wait.
[08:53.75]Minimap, pop, hold on.
[08:55.21]This is...
[08:57.82]Did not expect that that quickly.
[09:00.86]Give me one second.
[09:02.96]I lost my... There it is.
[09:03.96]Alright, first of all, I want to say thanks to Darth Jerma.
[09:07.40]That was delicious.
[09:09.82]Over 9,000 pills here in the Jazz Mania Devil.
[09:13.80]Over 9,000 is a new sub.
[09:14.98]The rest were resubs.
[09:18.54]Now, I couldn't see them before, but now let's go back into this without... No.
[09:24.26]Okay.
[09:28.40]I don't know where I'm going.
[09:33.42]I'm taking a really terrible way here.
[09:44.35]I love this game already.
[09:46.09]I'm gonna go on a huge jump!
[09:48.05]Come on.
[09:50.01]Do you really need to tell me how much speed I have?
[09:57.70]I don't know how he's still alive.
[10:04.99]I just dumped my friend.
[10:07.07]My friend is dead.
[10:09.03]I dumped the guy.
[10:17.18]Fuck you!
[10:18.42]What do you got?
[10:18.94]You did the same move to everybody?
[10:21.52]Do I have any weapons?
[10:28.85]You do the same stupid karate move.
[10:30.71]What happens if I jump?
[10:32.11]Oh, that's not jump.
[10:32.77]That's crouch.
[10:33.79]My guy's like a fucking lanky-ass shaggy.
[10:41.30]Everybody's listening to music in this game.
[10:44.76]What the fuck are you doing?
[10:45.94]Alright, I'm gonna play the game.
[10:56.03]There's no jump?
[10:58.80]Everybody's like snapping their fingers like walking around town!
[11:01.44]I just- this is the same guy that I just beat up.
[11:06.66]Stay on the fucking ground this time.
[11:07.92]Okay, can I like restart?
[11:14.21]Yeah, okay.
[11:21.65]Alright, now I have like a second here.
[11:28.66]Bottom, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
[11:31.12]Ugh, it's so loud.
[11:35.26]I'm gonna play this like GTA game, you know?
[11:38.78]I gotta go to the yellow marker.
[11:45.82]Up here, I'm gonna bang left.
[11:46.76]And then I'm gonna turn this down.
[11:50.72]One way or another, I'd like to see you.
[11:54.28]I'm gonna get you, get you, get you, get you.
[12:00.04]No, I can't turn the music back on.
[12:04.02]If I turn the music back on, then this whole VOD will get banned, and I won't be able to, like, upload it.
[12:08.54]Let's pretend it's playing.
[12:16.78]Yeah, yeah, that's how fast I'm going.
[12:19.94]Funny music.
[12:20.48]Is that where I gotta go?
[12:21.94]Star?
[12:29.14]Alright, I did it.
[12:30.98]No, not quite.
[12:31.90]What does this mean?
[12:35.64]I don't know what that means.
[12:40.07]Put some royalty-free music on?
[12:43.99]Maybe, maybe.
[12:44.75]We'll see how far this goes.
[12:49.09]Nice PLO!
[12:56.14]There we go.
[12:57.12]I wonder how many people I can kill before getting the cough.
[13:03.08]Right in here.
[13:04.90]No, that's not correct.
[13:05.38]Everybody does the same flip when you hit them, right?
[13:24.75]Alright, yeah.
[13:25.61]Nice.
[13:26.51]Give me another cutscene.
[13:30.91]Thanks a lot, kid.
[13:31.81]This is where I disappear.
[13:33.81]Yeah, thanks a lot, kid.
[13:36.25]100 bucks.
[13:38.76]Let's see.
[13:44.00]Alright, let's see if we can... Wait, what?
[14:07.69]Yeah, let's go!
[14:08.33]Who cares about copyright?
[14:10.47]Fuck the system!
[14:12.03]Fuck the system!
[14:39.64]Is it only in a car?
[14:42.63]Does that only happen in a car?
[14:45.49]Please, God, tell me.
[14:48.07]God.
[14:49.05]When I open this door.
[14:50.85]Please.
[14:52.83]I can look at the taxi.
[14:55.71]Aww.
[14:55.85]I thought it was going to be one way or another.
[15:02.58]I'm getting into another car until we get one way or another.
[15:04.78]Nope.
[15:12.34]Get the fuck out of my way.
[15:14.36]Hold on.
[15:16.94]Hold on a second.
[15:19.34]Nope.
[15:20.36]That's not it.
[15:20.80]That's not the song.
[15:22.73]Is this the same radio station?
[15:25.03]Nope.
[15:25.53]Alright, we're this way.
[15:28.43]What are you listening to?
[15:30.87]Better be one way.
[15:33.96]What the fuck is this guy doing?
[15:41.35]It's gotta be the bus.
[15:45.39]Fuck.
[15:46.85]Alright, we had our fun.
[15:49.41]Music's going off.
[15:50.99]See you later, music, forever.
[15:52.28]What the hell am I supposed to do?
[15:56.34]What was that?
[15:57.90]Green or yellow?
[16:02.74]Anybody know what the mission even was?
[16:05.26]Because I don't.
[16:10.24]I guess we're going to go to the marker.
[16:11.24]Oh, the cops are on me.
[16:18.57]The cops are on me.
[16:19.25]I have to sidewalk driving.
[16:21.01]My life is an empty void.
[16:24.53]Ready to be filled with burgers.
[16:27.08]Cops are terrible in this game, it seems.
[16:29.00]Thank you, Nintendo.
[16:29.82]Lizard.
[16:30.24]Snap.
[16:30.70]Freeze.
[16:32.26]And a lonesome birthday party.
[16:36.74]All of you guys for resubscribing.
[16:39.12]This is still so fucking loud.
[16:42.46]Does it have to be that fucking loud?
[16:55.71]Stop leaving a trail of body.
[17:02.75]Neil's birthday, man.
[17:06.28]He doesn't run every red light, he carries.
[17:10.75]Ooh!
[17:12.21]Ooh, that was a bad accident.
[17:14.07]A really bad accident.
[17:21.57]This city seems pretty void of things.
[17:26.33]Pops you on me?
[17:28.03]Nice.
[17:28.43]Good job trying to get me to pull over.
[17:30.21]You did a pretty decent job with that.
[17:33.05]I'm gonna lose you in less than ten seconds.
[17:38.47]He's right behind me.
[17:40.06]I'm going to do some maneuvers here.
[17:45.60]Look at those maneuvers.
[17:47.96]He's not going to get me here.
[17:52.02]How do I turn my camera?
[17:53.02]There we go.
[18:02.14]I lost him.
[18:10.81]I'm good, I'm good.
[18:12.69]I'm okay.
[18:19.47]Where do I gotta go?
[18:24.50]What do I have to do?
[18:28.52]One way or another.
[18:33.04]Lose the cops?
[18:35.70]How am I supposed to lose the cops?
[18:38.52]Get out of here.
[18:39.34]Let me go on the marker.
[18:40.50]Get out of here.
[18:41.00]Did he just sneeze?
[18:44.69]That cop just sneezed.
[18:49.15]Get the fuck out of here.
[18:50.27]Do they have a gun?
[18:51.53]Oh, he's got a gun.
[18:53.23]Alright, we'll lose the cops.
[19:03.92]Cops lost.
[19:04.48]These guys are still alive.
[19:07.34]At least one of them is.
[19:10.49]I got an idea.
[19:11.11]I'm gonna crouch behind the car.
[19:12.69]I have a gun.
[19:13.83]Can I do anything?
[19:27.42]Come on, come get me.
[19:29.17]Oh, where did he go?
[19:30.57]Shit, he's around this car somewhere.
[19:38.00]Are you serious?
[19:39.02]You can't be serious right now.
[19:40.02]There's no way.
[19:40.78]You can't be kidding me.
[19:43.94]Lost him.
[19:47.52]Lost the cops.
[19:48.16]Good.
[19:54.42]Right?
[19:56.24]Alright.
[20:01.76]I wanted to explode so bad.
[20:05.11]It's so close to blowing up.
[20:07.11]I have to do this.
[20:07.91]I need to see what happens.
[20:08.69]I need to see how cool the explosion is.
[20:14.48]Here we go.
[20:22.48]Damn it.
[20:23.94]Hold on.
[20:25.62]How can it be on fire for this long and not explode?
[20:27.90]I don't understand.
[20:28.40]Can I get in?
[20:34.32]I can really move this thing, huh?
[20:41.00]I want to get in the cop car.
[20:43.86]Fucking whatever.
[20:49.64]What a good explosion that was.
[20:50.90]Oh, I missed a sub.
[20:56.14]Grenade 71822.
[20:57.60]Thanks for five months, dude.
[20:59.06]Hit New York in 75.
[20:59.86]Became a wheel man.
[21:02.43]Then had a wipeout.
[21:03.27]Yeah, I can look over and see how long ago they subbed him.
[21:06.03]Don't worry, I won't miss you.
[21:06.99]I won't miss you.
[21:08.37]I won't.
[21:09.03]I thought he was a dead body when he just rolled underneath.
[21:22.54]I need some more music.
[21:33.02]I just fixed you up with a shot at the big time.
[21:36.64]He can't talk over the music.
[21:45.77]What was his comment?
[21:46.49]I was too busy writing into things.
[21:47.85]Let's see.
[21:49.01]See if I can find it.
[21:50.33]Oh, fuck.
[21:50.73]I just skipped.
[21:51.49]What did it say?
[21:52.40]I completely missed it.
[21:53.44]I can't see it over here.
[21:54.08]It usually pops up over here.
[21:58.78]Check your map for the start.
[22:02.70]This is for a low down on the job.
[22:04.60]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22:07.14]Okay, so... Get in my car.
[22:10.68]I don't want... Okay, steel wheels for this guy.
[22:24.49]You got it.
[22:33.72]Wheelman.
[22:34.80]Collect the wrecked ride.
[22:36.32]Get it back to race.
[22:37.82]Fix it up.
[22:38.92]Take it for a spin.
[22:42.76]Game crashed.
[22:45.08]No, it didn't.
[22:45.62]No, it didn't.
[22:46.28]Oh, I... Whoa, what are you doing?
[22:56.31]Easy.
[22:56.65]He's not after me, is he?
[23:02.98]Why are there cops everywhere?
[23:04.40]I didn't do anything.
[23:07.00]The cops can just rip around the corner here.
[23:17.04]Okay.
[23:19.73]Okay, sure.
[23:22.17]Looks like you had somewhere to be.
[23:23.49]Important.
[23:29.11]Give us a sarcastic comment or a murderous look.
[23:36.07]Watch out, out of the way.
[23:39.26]Get out of the way.
[23:42.50]Move.
[23:48.12]Excuse me, excuse me.
[23:49.82]Oh, excuse me.
[23:53.43]I can do some good drifts in this game, right?
[23:55.01]Otherwise I'm not a good driver.
[23:59.33]The sub-question was, if you had five clones of yourself, what would your band name be?
[24:05.58]I don't know.
[24:10.49]It's a tough one.
[24:11.09]Hold on a minute.
[24:11.69]We have guys dressed in the same clothes.
[24:14.97]You know when people are dressed in the same clothing.
[24:17.75]They're part of the same gang.
[24:19.53]And will attack on sight.
[24:29.18]No.
[24:30.06]No, these are just three bombs.
[24:37.03]Can he stand in the fire?
[24:44.08]He's just gently walking away from it.
[24:46.09]Now here he goes, just snapping his fingers.
[24:47.49]I've got music in my head!
[25:08.55]Let's go.
[25:13.41]Where's the thing I need to get here?
[25:18.38]Oh, it's that beat-up piece of shit.
[25:23.04]Wait, I gotta take it to this dude's house?
[25:26.33]Get the ride back to Ray's and don't wreck it.
[25:28.63]Okay, don't wreck it, don't wreck it, don't wreck it.
[25:36.29]This is some time travel shit here, guys.
[25:39.25]They're back.
[25:39.91]Except they're wearing a different shirt.
[25:45.41]Hold on a second.
[25:49.83]Just one second.
[25:58.28]Okay.
[26:02.64]No, they're still dead.
[26:05.19]Just wait.
[26:07.23]Wait.
[26:08.19]They're going to be there again.
[26:13.30]Yep, here they come.
[26:13.88]Are they going to have a different colored shirt on?
[26:16.48]Let's find out.
[26:21.10]Come on, spawn.
[26:28.07]There they are.
[26:28.73]They have to be here.
[26:29.51]There they are.
[26:37.54]They keep going back.
[26:38.80]I love it.
[26:41.02]Hey, Murray's Bagels.
[26:42.08]Thanks for four months.
[26:46.02]Welcome back for the quad month.
[26:49.08]Much appreciated, dude.
[26:49.84]Thank you.
[26:57.20]Woohoo!
[26:58.12]Joyride!
[27:04.22]Don't wreck it, huh?
[27:05.54]Didn't say anything about going up and jump!
[27:07.46]Oh, fuck.
[27:15.25]Ah, fuck, I have to go all the way back here?
[27:16.77]No, that's dumb.
[27:30.24]Tch, I can punch a line.
[27:35.04]Going fast, going fast, going fast.
[27:39.67]Sorry.
[27:43.11]Would have been better with music.
[27:44.97]I agree.
[27:47.47]We can't always get what we want.
[27:49.87]I just got hit by the car when I jumped out.
[27:56.88]Did you hear that?
[28:01.22]I want, like, a weapon or something.
[28:02.50]Is there, like, a baseball bat I can use to swing around?
[28:04.94]Alright, let's go.
[28:23.15]Don't wreck it.
[28:27.03]Don't wreck it.
[28:28.85]How do I beep?
[28:31.17]I wanna go... okay.
[28:36.27]See that star right there?
[28:37.07]I'm gonna get it.
[28:41.71]That's where I need to be anyways.
[28:43.61]Watch this.
[28:45.43]I have to go this way, cause look at where the blip is.
[28:48.15]Big jump!
[28:49.79]Nice.
[29:00.36]No!
[29:01.24]Why?
[29:02.30]I didn't land it?
[29:03.41]How did I not land it?
[29:04.51]Wait, is it going fast enough?
[29:13.69]What the f?
[29:14.97]What the f?
[29:21.18]It bounced.
[29:21.80]Yeah, it bounced like a fucking bouncy ball.
[29:27.87]We're going to do it for real this time.
[29:29.17]The first mission of the dumb game.
[29:32.34]I just body tackled that guy.
[29:42.20]I jumped off the ropes in the ring and I flew at him and did a frog splash.
[29:48.37]Really effective.
[29:53.21]Yeah, I don't know why I'm trying to do jumps with this thing.
[29:54.65]It's like a beat up piece of crap.
[30:01.00]I have to hit those guys every time.
[30:03.40]Every single time.
[30:08.89]Skill Eject.
[30:10.49]I'm gonna do it.
[30:10.91]No!
[30:11.49]Don't do it!
[30:12.61]Have a little bit of fucking self-control.
[30:14.53]Go this way.
[30:15.03]I'm gonna getcha, getcha, getcha, getcha one way.
[30:24.70]That was so funny.
[30:26.94]There we go.
[30:28.28]We can actually complete the mission.
[30:30.72]I think I don't know could be wrong.
[30:33.80]Don't wreck it On the back yet
[30:47.29]Thank you.
[30:48.11]I will complete the mission.
[30:49.81]I wanna show you how things work around here.
[30:52.27]This is where the magic happens.
[30:54.49]Up here is where we keep track of current vehicle conditions, like heat, damage, and any nitros you've got.
[31:00.44]Over here is where we deal with the vehicle characteristics, like handling, acceleration, and top speed.
[31:07.32]You also get the vehicle name here, and what you got to spend on it here.
[31:11.30]What you got to spend on it, vehicle is spending.
[31:12.94]Let's start by putting this heap of junk back together.
[31:15.35]This piece is a heap of junk.
[31:16.97]Repair.
[31:18.47]Yeah.
[31:18.61]Nice.
[31:18.75]Out on the street, you're gonna pick up some heat.
[31:21.13]I know you're good, but it will happen.
[31:23.25]So listen up.
[31:24.37]If you can make it back here without a tail, I can clean things up.
[31:27.95]Mm-hmm.
[31:28.45]Give it a try.
[31:30.20]Like every Grand Theft Auto.
[31:31.98]Hold on, kid.
[31:34.46]One thing at a time, TK.
[31:36.26]Then he just told me to leave.
[31:37.22]Whoa, whoa, hold, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[31:43.32]Hold on, kid.
[31:48.69]Okay, good.
[31:50.36]So now we got something that's not gonna fall apart on you.
[31:53.20]I know Slink, though, and he's gonna wanna see a bit of style, too.
[31:56.56]So I got just what you need right here.
[31:58.98]I got plenty of spare parts lying around, and since you caught me on a good day, you can have one for free.
[32:04.64]Just this time, take what you want.
[32:07.11]Okay, kid, that's enough.
[32:08.81]I got a business to run.
[32:10.13]You want more?
[32:11.03]Come back when it's not on the house.
[32:13.43]Okay, now for the fun part.
[32:15.03]Okay, kid.
[32:15.81]And give me an engine.
[32:16.93]A stage one engine.
[32:17.97]Nice work, kid.
[32:18.63]Yeah.
[32:18.75]Bye.
[32:18.87]See you later.
[32:19.61]You fucking idiot.
[32:20.22]Okay.
[32:20.36]Is that my character?
[32:21.26]Why are they bouncing around?
[32:44.01]Mouth's not even moving.
[32:44.73]What?
[32:44.88]You want somebody to go 100 miles per hour?
[32:46.56]You know how dangerous that is?
[32:48.10]You understand how dangerous that is?
[33:11.45]He's not even in the car, I could just lie to him.
[33:13.03]Okay, ready?
[33:14.33]Alright, I'm gonna go.
[33:15.30]Woo, alright!
[33:26.62]That was awesome, you should have seen me back there, dude.
[33:28.16]I hit like 200 miles per hour.
[33:30.38]I did it.
[33:32.68]What's preventing me from just lying to him?
[33:36.13]Good joke.
[33:37.35]That was one for the vault.
[33:42.68]Do I just have to go 100 miles per hour?
[33:47.64]Oh, okay.
[33:48.16]Easy.
[33:48.40]I'm already going 80.
[33:50.62]90.
[33:50.64]100!
[33:50.66]100!
[33:52.16]Fuck.
[33:56.21]Oh, no.
[34:02.73]I'm wrecking it up.
[34:04.75]I'm wrecking it up.
[34:07.71]Just like that character, Ralph.
[34:15.38]Need a clip?
[34:15.82]Oh, there's the guy.
[34:17.08]There's those fucking three idiots again.
[34:18.42]They're dead.
[34:18.90]Alright, man.
[34:23.78]You want me to go 100 over here?
[34:29.82]So I start?
[34:30.66]Booty just took a picture of me.
[34:35.27]Good!
[34:36.79]Pass the next speed gun at 70.
[34:41.03]Oh.
[34:42.09]I just have to cross the plane.
[34:47.10]That sounds easy enough.
[34:52.07]I'll do you double that one.
[34:53.43]I'm gonna go 140.
[34:58.89]Take my picture, take my picture, take my picture.
[35:00.39]Oh god!
[35:10.58]Shit!
[35:11.30]No!
[35:12.38]No!
[35:18.30]No!
[35:18.74]No!
[35:18.80]I don't want to do this.
[35:25.09]Fuck!
[35:26.91]I had to... I had to do this.
[35:32.17]You can't spin the car over like GTA, come on.
[35:34.41]Now I want to drift.
[35:41.73]I have to do that into somebody.
[35:43.95]That's really important.
[35:47.67]Good.
[35:48.85]Nice work, kid.
[35:53.15]I have to go through this going 30, right?
[36:03.84]Huh?
[36:04.14]Why am I going over here?
[36:05.84]What's over here?
[36:10.10]What the fuck?
[36:11.02]No.
[36:11.36]I have to do the whole thing again?
[36:13.42]The entire thing?
[36:14.16]Even the cutscene?
[36:15.68]Even the cutscene.
[36:19.24]Why?
[36:19.83]What?
[36:20.45]No, that's dumb.
[36:21.47]That's really dumb.
[36:22.49]Gotta kill them.
[36:22.91]Have to kill them.
[36:23.43]All three of them.
[36:23.87]Have to die.
[36:24.35]Every time.
[36:24.65]Let me break.
[36:29.43]That's stupid.
[36:31.31]When I died that last time, didn't it put me... I have to go over this.
[36:37.32]I have to make the jump.
[36:38.02]I have to make the jump.
[36:38.66]I have to make this jump!
[36:47.41]Okay.
[36:48.17]Okay, I'm not fucking around anymore.
[36:50.09]This is... I can't believe I have to start over again.
[37:09.29]I can't believe it.
[37:11.07]There's no way.
[37:11.47]Why do I have to do this again?
[37:17.66]Get the fuck out of the way.
[37:20.84]This guy's dead in his car, and he's still driving.
[37:25.53]He's just barely on the gas.
[37:33.83]Is he dead?
[37:36.57]Yeah, he's dead.
[37:39.79]Just in case he wasn't.
[37:52.14]Whoops.
[37:53.02]Whoops.
[38:00.27]No, I had a checkpoint, though.
[38:03.81]That's the thing.
[38:14.24]I'm gonna make it through the first mission, I promise.
[38:19.34]Not doing the jump.
[38:20.12]It's not possible in this car.
[38:21.90]I've become very aware of that.
[38:23.20]Nice shortcut right there.
[38:30.94]Didn't even wreck it.
[38:39.36]Around the back.
[38:40.38]Don't wreck this, please.
[38:41.87]I don't want to do this again.
[38:43.41]In the garage.
[38:45.99]He's going to tell me all this stupid shit over... Ugh.
[38:50.08]I wanna show you how things work around here.
[38:52.58]This is where the magic happens.
[38:54.84]Up here is where we keep track of current vehicle conditions, like heat, damage, and any nitros you've got.
[39:00.81]Over here is where we deal with the vehicle characteristics, like handling, acceleration, and top speed.
[39:07.65]You also get the vehicle name here.
[39:09.55]I get it, Andre.
[39:11.65]Let's know his name.
[39:12.99]Let's start by putting this heap of junk back together.
[39:16.11]Put it back together.
[39:17.23]Good.
[39:17.43]He's like freaking out on me.
[39:18.84]I just painted the same color.
[39:20.96]I can't believe it's making me do this again.
[39:43.81]Go.
[39:44.63]Here comes the guy.
[39:45.31]He's gonna come over.
[39:45.93]Yep, cool.
[39:47.83]Okay.
[39:49.17]This is for real.
[39:50.21]I'm not gonna mess this one up.
[39:52.58]This ain't getting messed up.
[39:53.48]I can promise you that.
[39:58.82]If this gets screwed up, then it's on me.
[40:04.28]Just gotta go 60.
[40:05.02]That's it.
[40:06.18]60, 70, 100.
[40:13.08]How does he know Jerm is a kid?
[40:14.42]I can sneak through here.
[40:18.43]Alright, I gotta go 60 through this.
[40:20.53]That's important.
[40:25.15]Ah, didn't kill him.
[40:26.65]It's too late.
[40:27.97]The time for funny business is over.
[40:29.21]We gotta go 60.
[40:32.76]Going plenty fast.
[40:34.26]Don't hit anything.
[40:36.32]It's okay if you hit a person.
[40:37.34]There's a guy pointing a gun at me.
[40:40.26]The guy on the left is pointing a fucking gun.
[40:44.74]What was that?
[40:45.18]It was aiming at me.
[40:50.68]I have to turn around and kill them.
[40:58.65]Reset.
[40:59.13]Alright.
[41:04.31]Oncoming traffic.
[41:05.09]Moment of truth.
[41:06.07]I almost just ruined it.
[41:09.67]I wish it would stop doing that.
[41:11.29]Because I can't see when it does that.
[41:15.69]I gotta go a hundred through this one.
[41:21.50]Oh, that's the guy holding the speed gun?
[41:22.84]I need to run into him.
[41:24.12]I have to slam into that guy.
[41:26.76]Gotta go a hundred.
[41:27.68]Gotta go a hundred.
[41:39.58]I did it.
[41:40.02]I did it.
[41:40.83]I tried.
[41:41.09]I tried.
[41:46.93]You saw me.
[41:49.65]I went for it.
[41:56.05]Impressed him.
[41:56.59]Alright.
[41:57.15]Not to freak you out, but driver parallel lines is an anagram of all real spider liver.
[42:01.54]Coincidence?
[42:02.04]I don't think so.
[42:03.60]But thank you, Elliot Butt, for the four months.
[42:07.98]Welcome back, dude.
[42:16.38]All real spider liver.
[42:20.18]Can't be a coincidence.
[42:21.40]So what's the next mission?
[42:24.10]There's a stunt jump right there.
[42:25.44]Nah.
[42:26.56]Nah!
[42:30.96]Going so fast.
[42:40.25]Oh, I almost had bonus points.
[42:43.01]Almost.
[42:46.64]This thing's about to explode.
[42:47.56]How far away is this?
[42:55.99]Oh my god, this is far.
[43:00.69]What the hell is this thing?
[43:04.23]That's so far away.
[43:05.09]Fuck.
[43:15.00]What did I do?
[43:17.33]Was I going too fast?
[43:18.37]I'm speeding, that's why he's gonna pull me over?
[43:20.08]What happens if I- Okay, I'm gonna pull over.
[43:25.02]Okay.
[43:28.32]I pulled over for you!
[43:30.56]I was speeding!
[43:31.28]You don't have to ram me!
[43:34.47]This is completely unnecessary.
[43:37.59]I've already stopped moving.
[43:38.79]Now they're gonna shoot me with guns.
[43:45.90]Okay.
[43:50.16]I'm gonna... Yeah, what?
[43:58.48]These guys don't even... He's gonna stay here for a second.
[44:03.07]And... Oh, no.
[44:04.13]Haven't lost him yet.
[44:04.99]Gonna lose him.
[44:05.53]Gonna lose him.
[44:05.97]Gonna lose him.
[44:06.37]Gonna lose him.
[44:07.49]Fuck.
[44:09.79]Damn it.
[44:09.99]Did the officer tell him to move?
[44:16.28]I don't know.
[44:20.22]This guy's car is beat the fuck up, though.
[44:24.08]That thing ain't gonna last much longer.
[44:29.61]It's gonna blow up.
[44:33.59]It's always mine.
[44:36.15]Who's gonna blow up first?
[44:37.25]It's BattleBots.
[44:42.74]Alright, let's keep moving.
[44:45.38]I'm gonna have to ditch this thing pretty quickly, though.
[44:53.91]Why did he... Did you see that cough?
[44:55.39]He just... No... What?
[45:00.97]Oh, go, go!
[45:03.71]That would have been great if he blew up.
[45:05.41]Simpsons hit and run.
[45:06.53]I have to get across.
[45:10.08]Where's the bridge?
[45:10.96]I gotta go up with that.
[45:13.28]Why would they put the next mission, like the second mission in the game, across to the next island?
[45:17.84]Or am I out of my mind?
[45:23.98]Oh, fuck.
[45:31.47]I can see where I can go across.
[45:35.61]These same two guys will not leave me alone.
[45:41.74]Good luck getting in here, you idiotic AI.
[45:50.49]There's so much down here.
[45:51.67]There's so much just trash in here.
[45:53.25]Okay.
[45:55.03]I win.
[45:55.27]I'm gonna get up there.
[45:58.85]I think I need a new car, too.
[46:05.08]Yeah, I'm gonna take this one.
[46:10.63]It's an emergency.
[46:11.37]Get out.
[46:15.25]Thank you.
[46:18.83]First-person camera sick Do some first-person driving why not what is going what is this?
[46:31.37]It's pretty relaxing first-person camera I just got so complacent right there.
[46:40.92]Oh
[46:44.11]Get out of the way.
[46:45.83]Move.
[46:47.05]I know I get dead, but you have to move.
[46:53.25]Is that a cop right there?
[46:54.13]What are those tiny little lips on the map?
[46:58.55]It's cops?
[47:01.09]Yeah, I think they are.
[47:04.59]Austin Powers, yeah.
[47:06.90]That wasn't Austin Powers right there.
[47:10.70]Alright, almost there, almost there, almost there, almost there.
[47:14.73]Just gotta get off the off-ramp.
[47:17.61]Right behind the bus.
[47:20.17]Spin around.
[47:20.71]Is there water down there?
[47:23.51]No.
[47:23.95]Okay, thank god.
[47:30.04]And then it's right... there.
[47:32.34]Why was this so far away?
[47:39.34]Seriously.
[47:44.87]Second mission of the game is across the whole entire zones.
[47:50.82]Come on.
[47:55.86]Do I have to break into this prison?
[47:57.70]What is this place?
[47:59.24]Factory?
[47:59.88]Okay.
[48:00.44]Please, I'm not fucking this up because I don't want to go across the whole world again.
[48:04.52]Okay, kid, this is Slink.
[48:06.20]You know what this is about.
[48:07.60]Come meet me at the power station on Long Island.
[48:10.04]I gotta get your paces with the steel.
[48:12.52]Be sure you can handle yourself if you ever get in a situation, you know what I'm saying?
[48:17.24]First gun.
[48:17.66]I'm not even out of the tutorial.
[48:28.01]We're still doing the tutorial.
[48:33.94]Okay.
[48:34.14]Line up in the highlighted barrel.
[48:35.20]Yeah, okay.
[48:35.58]Okay.
[49:03.27]No, don't put me back.
[49:04.55]Don't put me back.
[49:06.29]Don't put me back.
[49:07.34]Don't put me back.
[49:08.64]Oh, thank God.
[49:10.62]If it was going to put me all the way back.
[49:13.64]Okay.
[49:13.90]If it put me all the way back, I would have just quit the game.
[49:35.40]Okay, draw your gun, yeah.
[49:39.36]Yeah, line up behind that barrel at the center of your vehicle.
[49:41.51]How come he takes the crosshair away?
[49:42.95]What the hell is he doing?
[49:46.29]Aim!
[50:03.96]Aim over... I want to aim over here.
[50:05.36]I can't fucking help it.
[50:22.55]Oh, I can't get... Nobody can give me any power.
[50:26.35]I'll just abuse it every time.
[50:33.61]It's so... This targeting is so dumb.
[50:36.73]Okay, so when I hold down, I shoot, right?
[50:38.81]I can't aim anymore.
[50:41.72]All I can do is move around.
[50:43.38]And he just shoots in a random direction.
[50:50.52]Strafing.
[50:51.26]Okay.
[50:52.14]Maybe I can learn more tips.
[50:55.08]I want to see Hornet slamming into that car front, back, and sides.
[51:00.27]Press right mouse button to draw your gun, then face the car, and press and hold right mouse button to target the car.
[51:06.31]While holding right mouse button, you can strafe around the... Okay.
[51:19.00]Yeah, I... Alright.
[51:22.90]I'm doing it.
[51:24.90]I just did it.
[51:33.71]What does it want me to do?
[51:34.57]I don't get this.
[51:38.23]Does it want me to get strafed?
[51:39.77]I don't understand.
[51:46.91]Get out of the way.
[51:48.01]No!
[51:48.25]What?
[51:57.54]What did I tell you?
[51:59.87]What is going on?
[52:01.35]No!
[52:01.83]Fuck!
[52:02.62]No!
[52:03.08]I wanted to talk... I don't understand what the fuck is going on.
[52:12.18]Does anybody get what's happening right now?
[52:17.65]I thought I was supposed to go back and forth, and apparently I auto-locked onto him and shot him.
[52:25.79]Alright, how do you target?
[52:26.86]If you go first, it's gonna auto-lock on random shit that you don't want to target.
[52:37.30]Shoot the windows, you schmuck.
[52:38.72]Alright, let's go.
[52:44.27]Targeting acquired.
[52:47.95]Oh, nice shooting.
[52:56.10]See, I lose lock on when I go around this way.
[52:58.18]Why?
[52:58.32]What?
[53:00.88]Why?
[53:09.79]What the fuck did I do wrong?
[53:21.17]Strafe around the car and he's that's that's not correct.
[53:25.17]That's not correct and he kicks me out I'm going to sit there and read that very very carefully Okay
[53:47.48]Press right mouse button to draw your gun, then face the car and press and hold right mouse button to target the car.
[53:54.81]Press space to continue.
[53:56.89]While holding right mouse button, you can strafe round the car by keeping it in the center of your view and pressing A-D.
[54:06.26]Isn't that exactly what the fuck I was just doing?
[54:09.38]Locked on.
[54:17.41]What the fuck is happening?
[54:27.61]What's going on?
[54:30.29]What is going on?
[54:38.08]What is going on?
[54:41.82]I don't understand.
[54:43.02]Strip around the car.
[54:44.22]I'm doing that right now.
[55:07.52]What else is there to do?
[55:14.02]I did it.
[55:14.80]I did it.
[55:15.58]I did it.
[55:17.98]Unbelievable.
[55:20.44]Of course I can.
[55:42.39]No!
[55:43.31]No, it's too... Sure thing.
[55:45.19]Bam!
[56:00.33]Driving and shooting.
[56:01.21]You guys thought he was saying, hey?
[56:03.47]Hey!
[56:03.69]Hey!
[56:04.01]He just keeps saying, hey.
[56:05.19]Why is he putting his hands up?
[56:06.01]Okay.
[56:06.11]He's like, don't shoot me.
[56:08.59]I just told you all you need to know.
[56:39.13]Where'd he go?
[56:41.15]How do I drive the car like this?
[56:44.41]This is not a good way to be driving.
[56:47.98]Someone else is driving this car.
[56:49.50]It's not me.
[56:58.10]Here are the three guys.
[56:58.88]And they're dead.
[57:02.18]He didn't hit them.
[57:03.58]Somehow.
[57:04.36]I don't know how.
[57:05.35]But he didn't.
[57:08.57]Whoa!
[57:08.79]He did it.
[57:26.13]Bam!
[57:26.53]You know I hate doing this, but I gotta ask you for a contribution.
[57:30.83]Help keep this garage out of the red, and help me with a few debts I got on the side.
[57:36.08]There's all kinds of opportunities to earn... He shoots the tire.
[57:38.62]The car explodes.
[57:40.56]...for these signs around the city.
[57:42.62]Each one is paid there.
[57:44.16]If you got the skills... Okay, do some jobs.
[57:46.59]...I need $1,500.
[57:48.59]Why do I have 10,000 bullets?
[57:52.23]Where am I hiding those?
[57:55.09]Okay.
[57:56.19]Cool.
[57:59.83]Pay Ray.
[58:01.17]Earn 1500 bucks.
[58:02.43]Get the cash back to LaGuardia.
[58:08.51]Ruse the city for work.
[58:16.42]What's the red ticker?
[58:19.54]Am I just going to drive around like this for the rest of the game?
[58:22.66]Maguardia Race.
[58:24.64]Drive into the hotspot to select difficulty level.
[58:29.43]How am I supposed to know which difficulty level that is?
[58:31.15]Alright, we're going to do the hardest one.
[58:33.67]Which I'm assuming, yeah, hard.
[58:34.93]Let's go.
[58:41.19]Three laps.
[58:48.03]I love how I'm in my grandma boat car and they're in fucking Formula 1 cars.
[58:53.15]This was a great idea.
[59:00.20]Well, gotta make the best of a bad situation.
[59:09.85]I don't want to do this for like two more laps.
[59:11.41]I'm just gonna sabotage.
[59:24.55]Hold on.
[59:28.89]Hold on.
[59:29.59]How many laps have they got?
[59:32.09]Three?
[59:32.37]Nice race.
[59:33.95]I'm having fun in my race.
[59:50.79]What?
[59:51.45]Oh, no guns!
[59:53.95]No!
[59:55.19]No, I wanted to smash into him.
[59:57.48]I have... Get me out.
[59:59.86]No, goodbye.
[60:02.20]It actually got mad at me for shooting the gun.
[60:08.89]How do I get out of this?
[60:15.17]Get me the fuck out of here.
[60:19.26]Oh boy.
[60:20.70]Okay, we're just gonna lose again.
[60:22.02]Except this time I want to drive straight into someone.
[60:28.08]Three laps, you got it.
[60:29.19]Three, two, one, go!
[60:30.93]This thing's gonna explode.
[60:37.33]I forgot already.
[60:38.95]I already forgot.
[60:46.45]Yeah, looks like I can't race.
[60:47.59]No guns.
[60:54.64]Go to the easy one?
[60:55.52]No.
[60:55.86]Fuck the race.
[60:56.48]I just want to get out of there.
[60:58.06]Get me out.
[61:00.72]Get out of here.
[61:04.33]Where's the exit?
[61:07.69]How do I get out of here?
[61:09.97]Get me out of here.
[61:12.35]There's no exit.
[61:17.56]Am I just locked in here?
[61:18.48]Am I trapped in here forever?
[61:21.92]Try shooting the cars.
[61:23.34]Can I climb this fence?
[61:27.80]Get me the fuck out of here.
[61:29.92]I'm fenced in.
[61:30.84]I'm caged in like an animal.
[61:34.54]Do I have to do this race?
[61:35.60]I have to go like around here.
[61:46.53]Okay.
[61:49.39]The one entrance.
[61:54.17]Shut up!
[61:54.43]Shut up!
[62:09.49]This mouse sensitivity is way too high.
[62:11.27]Motherfucker!
[62:16.30]Motherfucker!
[62:27.58]Where is this list leading me, by the way?
[62:31.21]The world seems to end over here.
[62:32.39]Alright, where is there a job?
[62:37.07]Lone Shark.
[62:37.71]We're going to Lone Shark.
[62:46.35]Wait a second.
[62:47.27]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[62:49.87]Give me the bike.
[62:50.81]I want the bike.
[62:53.02]Get off that thing.
[62:57.34]What?
[63:03.94]Got the bike.
[63:06.10]I got the bike.
[63:06.66]That guy's gone.
[63:12.49]What?
[63:12.97]How do you...
[63:17.53]Look at this guy's neck.
[63:19.37]This guy's neck is just broken.
[63:21.42]I can't even... Oh, my fucking god.
[63:26.40]Give me a break.
[63:29.26]I can move it.
[63:29.66]I can move it.
[63:32.46]My strength.
[63:35.28]My superhuman strength.
[63:36.96]I can move the car.
[63:37.61]Alright, now give me the...
[63:47.05]Can I seriously not get this now?
[63:49.19]And I can't even go in this car.
[63:50.19]Hold on.
[63:54.88]Did I just kill that guy?
[64:00.24]Alright, bike has been freed.
[64:11.33]What the hell is happening?
[64:14.91]Give me the bike!
[64:18.69]That took way longer than it should have.
[64:26.57]Okay.
[64:35.27]Is he dead?
[64:41.09]I can't see anything.
[64:45.01]Seriously, this is so hard to control.
[64:46.60]You have no idea.
[64:47.26]Why is this still...
[64:51.85]I don't want to... Okay, now I can... No, it's still hard to control.
[64:57.25]Can I do, like, a kickflip?
[65:08.17]Is this a mobile game?
[65:09.53]No, it's a driver, man.
[65:10.61]I'm the driver here.
[65:16.17]So I'm starting to feel like I need to go underneath.
[65:21.23]Where was I before?
[65:25.18]Kickflip.
[65:25.76]Yeah, we're gonna do a kickflip.
[65:26.98]I wanna... Oh, fuck.
[65:31.38]Where is that guy going?
[65:34.10]That guy was going so fast.
[65:36.08]Where are all these people going?
[65:37.70]Why is there a traffic jam right here?
[65:42.03]Ah, shit.
[65:42.53]Yeah, we're just driving around the parking lot in a fucking straight line.
[66:00.41]Is this an airport?
[66:03.33]What is this?
[66:06.57]Checkpoint.
[66:07.19]Race.
[66:07.65]Airport.
[66:10.10]Oh, I gotta go.
[66:10.86]I gotta go.
[66:11.26]Time.
[66:11.54]Race.
[66:12.22]Here it comes.
[66:18.14]I'm gonna make that money right now.
[66:22.84]Shit, watch out for the fucking Zam- the ice machine.
[66:24.79]Zambo- Zambuca?
[66:26.39]Zambo- Zamboni?
[66:27.29]Zamboni.
[66:28.27]Zambuca is like an alcohol.
[66:34.45]Hold it together.
[66:40.43]What?
[66:41.98]I went right through it.
[66:50.08]Put the gun away.
[66:51.08]Put the gun away, please.
[66:52.86]Put the gun away.
[66:54.54]How do I put the gun away?
[66:56.60]Put the gun away.
[66:59.40]You fucking asshole.
[67:09.90]Yeah, I beat your record, buddy.
[67:11.16]What are you gonna say about that?
[67:13.99]Oh, shit!
[67:14.71]Oh, shit!
[67:21.11]Get on the bike, quick!
[67:22.93]Get on the bike.
[67:30.08]I gotta get more speed than that.
[67:36.55]No!
[67:37.95]No!
[67:38.43]Turn around!
[67:39.03]Turn around!
[67:39.39]Turn around!
[67:39.71]Turn around!
[67:40.01]Turn around!
[67:41.87]Turn around two seconds!
[67:46.31]One second!
[67:47.41]I got it!
[67:48.55]I got it!
[67:57.16]I got it this time.
[68:02.80]This time I won't take the gun out.
[68:05.45]It's going to go really slow.
[68:07.65]Really shitty.
[68:09.73]Really shittily all over the place.
[68:11.61]Carrots, right?
[68:13.14]No big deal.
[68:20.82]Wasted.
[68:25.02]Heroes never die.
[68:28.08]Go to practice.
[68:32.10]Well, I need to do this with a car.
[68:34.74]How am I going to get enough speed to go over that dumb thing?
[68:38.48]Without falling off the bike.
[68:39.86]Look, look, I don't have enough speed.
[68:41.28]I don't have enough speed.
[68:41.88]I'm going to hit the wall again.
[68:42.56]I'm going to hit the wall again.
[68:44.43]I can't.
[68:47.45]There's no way I make that jump.
[68:48.53]There's no way.
[68:49.89]You don't make that jump.
[68:52.39]You just hit the wall.
[68:55.63]You just hit the fucking wall.
[68:57.21]Hold on.
[69:07.58]I got it.
[69:19.29]Let's go, motherfucker.
[69:27.55]Here we go.
[69:29.51]Over the jump!
[69:35.10]Huh?
[69:36.45]Huh?
[69:38.25]What?
[69:41.48]What the fuck?
[69:43.06]I thought I had like 30 seconds left.
[69:46.18]I need a car.
[69:55.19]Did I have more time?
[69:56.27]Let's go.
[70:07.25]This game looks good.
[70:09.57]Well now I don't have to spend- Come on, please!
[70:19.99]You had two seconds, there's another- I thought I had like 20 seconds.
[70:32.75]Here's what we're gonna do.
[70:35.45]We're just gonna do it on this.
[70:36.85]It's easier to move around with the bike.
[70:41.07]And then we're gonna get in the car and go over it.
[70:45.19]Beat this guy's record.
[70:46.07]Get the fucking 10 grand that I deserve.
[70:52.20]I just figured it out.
[70:55.22]I just figured it out.
[70:57.58]It's the mouse that makes you go up and down.
[71:02.95]Did not know that.
[71:04.01]Now I do.
[71:05.39]Should I try it with the mouse up?
[71:07.27]I'm going to try it once with the mouse up.
[71:10.06]Because you pull back on the mouse.
[71:11.52]Here we go.
[71:19.32]I'm going to pull back on the mouse.
[71:25.11]It didn't work.
[71:26.07]It didn't work.
[71:26.45]It's okay.
[71:26.73]There's a car right here.
[71:33.69]Didn't work.
[71:40.14]Can't go up that jump with a bike.
[71:41.06]It doesn't work.
[71:41.54]Can't do it.
[71:50.85]I better make this.
[71:59.21]Why do they make this jump not possible on a bike?
[72:02.45]Why?
[72:03.79]Why can you not go off that jump on a bike?
[72:06.07]Oh my fucking god.
[72:09.88]That doesn't make any sense.
[72:20.79]You just hit the wall when you're on a bike.
[72:25.11]I'm going to beat this.
[72:29.56]We're gonna get there, no more fucking around, no more jokes, no more funny, this isn't funny.
[72:35.07]I'm not happy right now, I'm not laughing.
[72:41.83]Don't do a wheelie.
[72:43.27]Just get there, get in the car, turn around, and do it.
[72:50.78]Okay, get in here.
[72:55.82]Get in the fucking car.
[73:01.09]Go.
[73:07.87]Get some speed.
[73:17.04]Go.
[73:18.94]See?
[73:20.00]29, 28.
[73:20.56]I had like 30 seconds left the last time I did this.
[73:24.74]Look at the clock.
[73:32.69]Alright, 12 seconds.
[73:38.75]Get over there.
[73:41.46]Seven.
[73:46.70]Three.
[73:48.79]No!
[74:17.97]Don't use a car.
[74:18.67]I have to do it.
[74:19.75]I just did.
[74:20.39]The bike doesn't... You can't physically jump off that with the bike.
[74:24.47]It doesn't work.
[74:26.42]You just go into the wall every time.
[74:35.36]Fuck this mission.
[74:36.10]We're going... Where are we going?
[74:38.08]Lone Shark.
[74:38.58]That's where I wanted to go in the first place.
[74:43.48]Open up the door.
[74:50.21]Now I'm stuck in the airport.
[74:57.42]Fuck you, worker.
[74:59.63]Fucking worker at the airport telling me to beat your time.
[75:01.81]Your time sucks.
[75:17.46]Destroy the fence.
[75:20.30]The whole thing.
[75:21.04]I'm gonna go off this jump.
[75:26.69]Nice!
[75:29.57]I actually made it back to civilization.
[75:40.05]Do an improv bit at the airport?
[75:53.46]Okay, why is it... I want to go here.
[75:57.34]I don't want to go back here.
[75:58.88]Why does it want me... Oh, it's because I have to get money.
[76:04.48]The two markers... The yellow one is like, turn in the money.
[76:07.78]Okay.
[76:16.67]Back to the bike.
[76:20.23]Still got a cigarette in his hand.
[76:27.13]Why is he running like that?
[76:28.19]This guy's doing like his best gorilla impression.
[76:35.97]Oh fuck, police.
[76:39.15]Get on the bike and get out.
[76:44.92]Something's wrong with the tire.
[76:47.34]No, I'm just an idiot.
[77:01.42]Anybody would have fallen off this bike right now.
[77:04.86]Not me.
[77:06.70]Not me.
[77:08.76]Still on it.
[77:09.20]You can't take me off.
[77:12.96]Okay.
[77:13.18]What is with the fucking time limit?
[77:15.32]What is with these time limits?
[77:34.14]I'm still on it.
[77:34.84]Alright, where is this?
[77:37.14]I'm really close.
[77:42.72]Does everything seriously have to have a time limit?
[77:49.83]Gotta get money.
[78:00.97]Okay, so he's down here.
[78:05.85]Was not going fast enough to do that.
[78:10.53]Fuck a cop.
[78:10.95]Shit.
[78:13.29]Is this guy... Oh, he's trying to get away from me.
[78:24.54]I get it.
[78:29.92]He's really trying to get away from me, apparently.
[78:32.42]Does he know I'm after him?
[78:33.37]Ah!
[78:44.97]This thing is gonna blow.
[78:45.97]I think he missed a few... I think he missed a few objects.
[78:53.71]Yeah, I may have.
[78:57.75]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[79:00.46]I'm gonna die.
[79:03.64]This thing is... I can't even see.
[79:08.00]This is so awkward driving around.
[79:14.71]Such awkward controls.
[79:17.48]Why do I have 10,000 bullets?
[79:18.78]Give me the money.

[83:51.68]I can't step on the gas.
[83:53.90]I gotta get out.
[84:17.09]Some creep thinks that you're in here to get my money.
[84:22.36]If you won't cooperate, then use your imagination.
[84:42.66]I don't know why I think that's so funny.
[84:45.85]It's so funny to me.
[84:59.92]The timer's back.

[85:04.62]I just realized that right now.

[85:42.00]Look at how reckless he's driving.
[85:43.30]There's no more timer.
[85:45.10]He is freaking the fuck out.
[85:48.29]Stop, man!
[85:59.46]Get out!

[86:10.60]We don't have to worry about him anymore.
[86:18.97]I'm good.
[86:21.67]I'm not going to blow up.
[86:23.67]I'm going to be fine.
[86:26.92]I'm going to run this guy into something so he can crash complete.
[86:30.50]I'm going to lose him over here.
[86:36.14]On the golf course.
[86:36.84]I don't know where the fuck this is.
[86:44.54]New car.
[86:45.54]Get a new car.
[86:50.05]Okay.
[86:50.39]We're fine.
[86:54.89]You're a fighter, I'm gonna throw up.
[87:08.72]The same thing happened to me last time in this stupid medium.
[87:12.92]Oh shit.
[87:20.05]Crouch.
[87:21.41]Crouch!
[87:23.45]Why won't he crouch?
[87:24.31]Crouch.
[87:27.03]Oh my god.
[87:29.65]Apparently crouch doesn't work anymore.
[87:44.28]An odometer?
[87:46.38]Yeah, it does count the miles, doesn't it?
[87:55.93]Here's the money.
[87:58.19]And thank you very much.
[87:59.49]Job complete.
[88:00.69]Nice, I get 500 bucks.
[88:12.27]Street race.
[88:14.45]Street race.
[88:15.53]Lone shark.
[88:16.67]I don't... Let's do this street race.
[88:21.90]It says it's easy.
[88:33.59]Let's go this way.
[88:36.01]You Uber driver.
[88:36.85]Look how huge the moon is.
[88:38.49]That's a huge moon.
[88:46.31]See what I did there?
[88:46.83]I waited until it was green so I wouldn't get in trouble.
[88:53.70]Except I crashed into a fucking guy.
[88:56.70]Uh, where's this?
[88:57.34]I gotta go, like, around.
[89:00.98]Can I get up there this way?
[89:02.10]I don't think so.
[89:08.26]Watch it.
[89:09.19]Watch it.
[89:13.29]Can I please get over there from here?
[89:17.53]Easy feet.
[89:22.02]Oh, look at all three of us.
[89:23.06]We look so bored.
[89:30.02]We just look completely and totally out of it like we don't even care.
[89:41.98]Oh, this isn't taking me there.
[89:51.12]Okay, lost him.
[89:53.06]Lost him.
[89:57.66]Now where am I going?
[89:58.54]Right here.
[90:00.20]It's just straight line.
[90:01.76]Boys and girls, straight line.
[90:03.07]I want to see what happens after I get 1,500.
[90:07.75]Get three jobs, turn it in, and see what happens.
[90:16.61]I need a better car, though.
[90:21.05]The only cars that are on the street are taxi cabs and these crappy cars.
[90:25.38]There's no actual cars.
[90:27.26]Prank tracks.
[90:29.95]Train tracks.
[90:32.19]Train tracks.
[90:37.23]Better be a train.
[90:41.75]I really hope there's a train.
[90:52.72]I'm willing to do this until we find the train.
[90:55.32]If there is one.
[91:01.83]Come on.
[91:05.53]There's gotta be a train.
[91:10.47]You wouldn't put this whole thing here if there wasn't a train.
[91:14.38]I hear it.
[91:14.62]Can I hear it?
[91:18.80]Is that a train?
[91:23.98]No, I think it was a garbage truck.
[91:34.32]I don't think there's a train.
[91:35.48]We probably would have seen it.
[91:38.20]Oh well.
[91:43.94]This is fun, huh?
[91:48.32]What a fun train track.
[91:52.34]You are the train?
[91:55.54]No.
[91:55.92]No train.
[91:58.70]Fuck.
[91:59.90]Oh well.
[92:00.85]We tried.
[92:05.05]We tried.
[92:06.27]Oh, well.
[92:10.89]I love how I'm driving a little dune buggy now.
[92:17.86]This is so painfully slow.
[92:21.42]This is just... This sucks.
[92:25.04]I really am the train.
[92:26.38]Trains go like 40 miles per hour, don't they?
[92:29.45]I'm pretty much in the train right now.
[92:36.32]This is dumb.
[92:40.86]It's gotta be worth it.
[92:43.20]Train!
[92:43.58]There's a train!
[92:44.63]There's a train!
[92:46.13]There's a train!
[93:02.19]I lost all my money.
[93:20.27]Game crashed.
[93:22.39]I think.
[93:26.40]Yeah.
[93:29.02]Game crashed.
[93:32.06]I don't even know.
[93:32.48]I might not even be streaming.
[93:34.10]Am I?
[93:34.58]I don't know.
[93:38.12]Did it kill my whole entire... Yeah, everything.
[93:40.34]I think everything died.
[93:41.90]I might still be streaming.
[93:47.80]Well, it might hook into my Twitch, and I might be gone here in like 10 seconds.
[93:58.16]I hope it doesn't happen.
[93:58.92]I hope it doesn't happen.
[94:01.46]Come on.
[94:02.22]Don't kill the whole stream.
[94:04.19]Yes, we're still live.
[94:07.89]Okay.
[94:09.21]Alright.
[94:09.53]Alright.
[94:10.13]Starting soon.
[94:16.84]I'll be right back, I'm gonna get some, hold on a second, I'm getting some tea.
[94:36.61]Okay, we got to see the train.
[94:40.28]Alright, I'm going to go pee.
[94:42.49]I'll be right back.
[94:44.19]I will return.
[94:44.69]We're going to play something else.
[94:46.80]I'll be back.
[96:55.47]Okay.
[96:57.97]So I think I'm going to do some placement matches in Overwatch because I haven't really done them.
[97:04.32]I played one.
[97:04.90]I think that's probably a good idea.
[97:10.40]Do that for like an hour.
[97:15.05]We shall see.
[97:19.39]I have a couple of games that I want to play though.
[97:22.98]Not tonight.
[97:25.76]Either that or... Oh, my God.
[97:30.32]Everyone's freaking... Nobody... No.
[97:33.09]No.
[97:33.95]No.
[97:34.45]Nobody wants to see Overwatch, huh?
[97:35.81]Oh, my God.
[97:38.89]I have not seen this type of anti-Overwatch.
[97:43.25]Oh, my goodness.
[97:53.30]Well, I have to play my placement matches at some point, guys.
[98:03.11]Let's see, what else can I play?
[98:04.47]I have a couple of things I could play.
[98:05.78]Although I have no idea how to play this.
[98:08.94]I've no idea.
[98:09.74]I just, I got it.
[98:11.54]You know what?
[98:12.00]You know, we're going to do this.
[98:13.82]I don't know how long I'm going to play this for.
[98:15.16]I'm not going to play Overwatch.
[98:18.32]The people have spoken.
[98:20.86]The people have spoken.
[98:22.03]We're not playing Overwatch.
[98:22.97]We're going to play the Technomancer.
[98:28.73]I don't know.
[98:30.01]I have no idea.
[98:31.05]I just saw it and I was like, you know what?
[98:32.39]I'm going to fucking whatever.
[98:33.85]Let's play.
[98:34.11]I'm going to change my screen title.
[98:42.96]To Technoman.
[98:49.52]And then... Techno.
[98:58.39]I think this game sucks, by the way.
[99:04.25]We'll find out.
[99:07.85]This might be just as dumb as the one we just played.
[99:11.24]I don't know.
[99:11.72]We'll find out.
[99:12.76]Hopefully it works.
[99:14.26]I'm going to kill all the audio for the stream here for a second because this is going to be so outrageously loud that I'm going to have to mess around with it.
[99:25.23]It's so loud.
[99:25.95]You can probably listen.
[99:26.83]Can you hear that through my headphones?
[99:29.81]I'm glad I didn't do that.
[99:32.63]See you guys.
[99:40.12]Wow.
[99:40.78]Loud.
[99:41.16]Oh boy.
[99:44.48]So loud.
[99:49.24]Options.
[99:50.44]Audio.
[99:52.04]Shut up.
[99:58.23]Okay, I'm gonna turn it back on.
[100:04.11]Yeah, I got actually Oh, fuck me.
[100:12.42]Okay, confirm.
[100:17.53]Okey dokey.
[100:21.00]Why would it tell me save and quit to adjust the audio?
[100:24.65]Are you fucking kidding me?
[100:25.99]What are you talking about?
[100:27.83]Game already sucks.
[100:31.97]Okay.
[100:33.89]Tutorials, subtitles, damage display.
[100:36.29]I don't know what any of this means.
[100:37.65]I don't know, guys, but hopefully it's in 1920 by 1080.
[100:42.72]Yep.
[100:48.99]Field of vision.
[100:49.77]I'm going to assume that's field of view.
[100:54.23]Shadows.
[100:54.71]Everything's on ultra.
[100:55.71]My computer sucks.
[100:56.55]It can't handle that.
[100:58.45]Game sucks.
[100:59.41]Computer sucks.
[101:06.12]Brightness.
[101:09.74]Whatever.
[101:10.38]I'm ready.
[101:10.92]I just want to put it on here now.
[101:15.39]Okay.
[101:16.09]I'm going to change to this
[101:20.42]the Technomancer.
[101:23.08]Should be changed over here.
[101:24.40]Okay.
[101:32.80]Let's play the Technomancer.
[101:38.81]New game.
[101:40.95]Extreme, no.
[101:41.67]Just normal.
[101:42.19]Just doing normal.
[101:44.31]This game probably sucks.
[101:45.11]I don't know.
[101:45.71]Like I said, who knows.
[101:52.51]I gotta like make a new tweet.
[101:57.87]This tweet's not accurate.
[102:09.78]What is it?
[102:10.04]What are they talking about?
[102:10.80]Water and conflict?
[102:17.95]Is this just about like Nestle?
[102:27.74]So we're living in hell.
[102:33.36]Whoa.
[102:36.08]No, so... Oh, shit!
[102:40.06]I didn't turn the sound back on.
[102:41.36]I'm sorry.
[102:43.86]the ones who remain similar to our ancestors I'm just like texting and like writing things thank you very much of course in despair there is hope whoa that guy was just climbing on him oh
[103:12.09]Some have begun to explore, travel even, from corporation to corporation.
[103:21.52]We have organization, structure, and inevitably, politics.
[103:28.29]We have rulers, a people's assembly, and far removed from us, the Dowser, the inaccessible face of abundance.
[103:39.32]And finally, there's us.
[103:41.80]The elite protectors of the people.
[103:44.09]The spearhead of the army.
[103:46.07]My brothers and sisters who all share the same special gift.
[103:48.57]We just keep going up in a... Whoa, there's the electricity.
[103:50.67]That's what I'm talking about.
[103:51.81]Dude, that's what I'm talking about.
[103:56.20]Huh?
[103:59.38]Oh.
[104:00.14]Sorry, I should probably... I was just looking at my phone, not looking at the screen, just pretending like I was watching and agreeing with things.
[104:07.51]Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[104:08.79]Cool.
[104:09.17]My eyes are down looking at the screen.
[104:16.85]Alright, let's go face.
[104:21.56]How many face choices do we have?
[104:22.74]A couple?
[104:23.64]Two?
[104:23.96]Three?
[104:24.50]Four?
[104:25.08]Five?
[104:27.12]Let's go with this one.
[104:28.00]I like that one.
[104:31.28]That one.
[104:32.92]I gotta be pale.
[104:33.33]I'm really pale.
[104:39.96]Let's go with that one.
[104:40.76]Hair color.
[104:45.28]It's kind of like me, right?
[104:47.26]Nah, it doesn't look like me.
[104:52.71]Good.
[104:53.09]Got it.
[104:54.91]Science level.
[105:00.29]I can already tell this is going to be a nightmare for you guys watching this.
[105:05.58]Uh, traps?
[105:07.16]Hold on, let's take a minute.
[105:08.86]Charisma.
[105:09.84]I've got to do charisma, right?
[105:12.22]There's dialog success and shit in this game.
[105:18.05]Charisma.
[105:19.65]Yep.
[105:21.73]I have to do charisma if it's available.
[105:23.17]Strength?
[105:27.17]Um... Agility, power, or constitution.
[105:33.62]Hand-to-hand attacks.
[105:36.63]crits and power.
[105:43.43]I think I want to be a spellcaster.
[105:48.16]Yeah, we're definitely going to be.
[105:49.84]The game's called Technomancer, not Punch People Simulator.
[105:53.26]I'm going to be an electricity technomancer.
[105:56.58]Yeah, definitely.
[105:59.90]Let's go.
[106:02.35]Nightbot still says Overwatch.
[106:03.89]Scott.
[106:04.53]My guy's real beat up.
[106:06.73]How's the audio?
[106:08.71]Too low?
[106:26.70]This guy looks like a Keebler elf.
[106:33.61]Go up in a tree and get me some cookies.
[106:37.57]Preferably the ones with the fucking chocolate in the middle that are soft and they don't even make them anymore.
[106:42.14]I want to skip this so bad.
[106:44.90]Yeah, okay, whatever you say.
[106:46.78]I don't care.
[106:47.82]I can't skip it, apparently?
[106:49.14]Oh.
[106:49.20]Yeah, I can.
[107:13.38]What am I doing?
[107:16.50]Oh, shit.
[107:22.36]Oh, my immersion's broken.
[107:23.30]I can't attack random people.
[107:25.13]Whoa!
[107:25.53]Look at this!
[107:25.89]I can do, like, Darth Maul moves!
[107:29.33]Alright, cool.
[107:29.79]What do I do?
[107:42.93]Craft in this game.
[107:48.17]This is too much for my brain to handle.
[107:51.52]Staff.
[107:53.38]Work bunches that you upgrade from parts of your equipment using components.
[108:02.19]No, no, no, no.
[108:03.49]I'm going to upgrade the serrated tanto.
[108:07.89]Yeah.
[108:08.63]Let's give it a little bit of a boost.
[108:14.31]Hit that.
[108:16.09]Go in there and disrupt it.
[108:18.19]Yep.
[108:18.87]Nope.
[108:21.55]Yeah.
[108:21.93]No.
[108:23.87]I'm going to put the knives on it.
[108:26.05]Critical update.
[108:28.14]Critical hit.
[108:30.64]Put it on there.
[108:31.40]Any components?
[108:33.86]Ah, shit.
[108:34.32]Shit.
[108:38.43]Who cares, who cares, who cares?
[108:40.73]Alright, let's go.
[108:43.55]I gotta get down there?
[108:44.27]Is there a jump?
[108:46.96]No, there's just a kick.
[108:47.70]You move around really weird in this game.
[108:56.40]What's going on in here?
[109:08.48]This is my spying partner.
[109:12.54]When do I get my electricity moves?
[109:17.34]I think that guy might be a synth.
[109:27.57]What's the girl doing?
[109:28.87]What's that lady doing?
[109:30.17]Look at this lady!
[109:33.57]Look at that lady by the fire.
[109:35.33]She keeps doing this little dance.
[109:38.57]Alright.
[109:41.09]Train at the different styles of combat.
[109:42.67]You're going to give me like a two hour long tutorial, aren't you?
[109:45.98]Finish training.
[109:46.70]I'm done.
[109:46.88]I did it.
[109:47.10]I know everything.
[109:48.34]Hahaha.
[110:16.06]Alright, you guys ready we're gonna play the game now
[110:22.32]This is going to be so much fun, dude.
[110:23.56]I'm going to do so many moves.
[110:25.06]You can make your character sprint.
[110:26.06]See, I got the tutorial on the top right.
[110:28.77]I'm fine.
[110:29.07]I got the tutorial already.
[110:30.09]I'm good.
[110:30.33]Don't worry.
[110:30.67]Actually, you know, no, I don't remember my first lesson.
[110:49.96]I need to turn the audio up.
[110:50.90]No audio.
[110:51.36]Is that better?
[110:52.04]That's probably better.
[110:53.75]Let's go.
[110:54.15]Wow, look at this game.
[111:28.40]I want his staff.
[111:29.20]Where do I get his staff?
[111:30.26]That thing's sick.
[111:32.04]Ooh!
[111:37.44]Oh, I can do moves.
[111:39.21]I can do, like, electricity moves.
[111:45.89]Alright, this is just Dragon Age, but on Mars with Darth Vader.
[111:50.49]What are you talking about?
[111:53.79]You drain an enemy, their death will cost you karma?
[111:56.08]Where's the train?
[111:56.52]Let's go.
[112:18.98]Climb down.
[112:22.47]I can't finish the tutorial if I can't climb down.
[112:24.67]Wait, what?
[112:27.39]Yeah, wait, really, wait, what?
[112:36.49]Hey, repper 500, reaper 500.
[112:37.08]They say, hey, Jerma, thanks for three months, welcome back.
[112:51.33]Find somewhere to watch from.
[112:54.55]Probably should have had the tutorial tell me how to climb down.
[113:03.50]How do I climb down?
[113:07.26]I don't know.
[113:10.52]I don't know what the button is to climb down.
[113:15.26]It's not that it's not that wait come on get down Um I guess I'll go the long way Oh, I got a club too.
[113:37.29]I got a sword and a shield
[113:43.35]Nice, it goes slow motion, too.
[113:48.63]Cool.
[113:53.25]This is pretty cool.
[113:54.60]It's a pretty cool game.
[113:57.26]It's not bad, man.
[113:58.36]It's not a bad game.
[114:13.29]Blending in.
[114:13.97]I'm going to die.
[114:16.84]I'm dead.
[114:19.92]Well, that game was pretty fun.
[114:21.98]That was a pretty fun game.
[114:22.82]Yeah, it was a fun game.
[114:28.48]I'm happy with that one.
[114:31.98]I'm sure it's pretty good.
[114:34.76]I'm sure it's fun.
[114:35.38]I'm sure it's a fun game.
[114:40.74]What's next on the Steam roulette wheel?
[114:43.26]Find out in 10 seconds.
[114:55.30]No, it was not $60.
[114:56.04]I just wanted to see what it was.
[115:02.28]Actually, you know, that's one of those games where I don't know if I'd want to stream that game.
[115:06.68]I thought it was going to be like way more action oriented, not like RPG-esque.
[115:11.93]It was $38.
[115:13.05]You know, don't take my word for it.
[115:23.22]I'll try that like off stream.
[115:27.14]Go back to YouTuber's life.
[115:32.63]No, I know what we're going to do.
[115:36.73]Actually, I'm playing that tomorrow.
[115:44.68]Oh, that's right.
[115:46.54]That's right.
[115:47.44]I'm going to do that.
[115:48.54]That's a great idea.
[115:50.86]I was planning on doing that.
[115:53.32]I'm going to do it now.
[115:56.30]Where is it?
[115:57.59]Where's Fistful of Frags?
[116:02.63]Do I not have it downloaded?
[116:12.89]Alright.
[116:14.13]I'm going to hop into Fistful of Frags.
[116:15.41]It's been a long time.
[116:16.55]I have to, like, delete this tweet off the Technomancer.
[116:23.85]Wow.
[116:26.19]Fucking Technomancer.
[116:27.59]I have to, like, I just tweeted that I was playing the Technomancer, and now it's instantly getting deleted.
[116:35.63]Now I'm going to write, just kidding, Fistful of Frags.
[116:47.42]I completely forgot how much I loved this game.
[116:54.49]Is it tweak on?
[116:55.59]Yeah.
[117:01.07]Fistful of Frags.
[117:08.11]Play this for like an hour or so, and then I'm going to get some food and end the stream.
[117:15.92]I got a plan for tomorrow night, though.
[117:17.56]It's going to be good.
[117:23.24]I bet you it'll be good.
[117:25.80]Or it won't be good, and you can hold it against me.
[117:27.48]You can say, Jerma, that stream sucked.
[117:29.83]And I'll be like, I know, it probably did.
[117:31.17]Alright.
[117:39.80]I need a minute or two because I didn't have it downloaded.
[117:43.52]I also need to quit out of this game that I'm in.
[117:48.68]Stream Guitar Hero?
[117:49.66]I'm going to just quit this.
[117:59.02]Move over here.

[118:47.45]Sorry.
[118:50.03]This game didn't last long.
[118:51.21]No, it did not.
[118:52.47]It was not what I thought it was.
[118:55.09]That doesn't mean it's bad or anything.
[118:56.51]It's just not what I thought it was going to be.
[119:06.61]How about just Yeehaw?
[119:07.69]How do you spell Yeehaw?
[119:10.64]Yeehaw.

[120:36.71]Properties, visible rags, and there it is.
[120:41.69]There she goes.
[120:45.57]Join free-for-all.
[120:47.26]It's been a long, long time.
[120:51.24]Let's see what I want to play with.
[120:54.46]This is new.
[120:55.48]I haven't seen this before.
[120:59.68]Damn.
[121:00.68]Left-handed, right?
[121:01.40]Didn't you want it to be left-handed?
[121:06.49]What's the... What's my button to... I gotta make sure my buttons are all correct.
[121:21.69]Use the bow.
[121:24.05]Yeah, I gotta look at my key bindings.
[121:26.71]Let's take a look at it right now.
[121:29.21]How do I get to my key bindings?
[121:33.41]Okey dokey.
[121:36.90]Um... Move forward, back, jump, duck is control.
[121:40.78]Okay.
[121:41.78]Walk is mouse four.
[121:42.98]That's what I was doing.
[121:45.08]Secondary attack, you hold down right click.
[121:47.68]Switch to revolver, reload, kick is shift.
[121:51.76]Okay.
[121:55.95]Okay.
[121:56.11]Okay.
[122:02.81]I remember how much I loved this game.
[122:04.29]Let's see if we can get a good streak going at some point.
[122:07.79]I'll turn it up too, it seems a little low.
[122:16.24]Give me the box!
[122:22.24]Ah, I have a blue box, it's not that good.
[122:23.72]I need to hold to stop reloading.
[122:36.32]The only boat you need to know is kick.
[122:38.80]Ah, he's reloading.
[122:40.74]Shit.
[122:45.16]You gotta use the mouse with your left hand.
[122:46.72]That would be terrible.
[122:50.16]No.
[122:50.44]Come on, give me a word out.
[122:59.01]I forget.
[122:59.35]It takes a while to get back into the swing of things with this game.
[123:02.59]Because it's very much about being very careful.
[123:12.11]I got to take that off the mouse for it.
[123:13.41]It's an awful place for it.
[123:14.53]Let's do that right now.
[123:16.43]It was alt initially, I think.
[123:18.19]Yeah, it was.
[123:21.21]Alt.
[123:22.13]Let's try it now.
[123:26.08]Yeah, that's better.
[123:29.63]Golden case.
[123:30.27]I remember the golden case.
[123:31.47]This thing was amazing.
[123:41.52]Are kicks still LP?
[123:42.40]I have no idea.
[123:43.08]That's a good question.
[123:48.62]Damn it!
[123:50.28]Also, um... Shift.
[123:55.38]Okay, it's shift, not that.
[124:00.86]Come back here.
[124:01.48]Do we have a weapon or anything good?
[124:06.86]Maybe some grandpa gameplay?
[124:10.11]No, not right now.
[124:10.75]I didn't want to turn it up though, but let's see if I can get at least two people.
[124:19.27]Pass the fucking whiskey.
[124:20.33]I think there's a golden chest up here.
[124:31.18]Oh shit.
[124:35.55]Something to note, I'm so used to playing Overwatch, that like, I'm just reloading.
[124:41.59]And like, jumping.
[124:42.33]Look, I'm jumping and shit.
[124:43.47]That's from playing Overwatch.
[124:57.52]He kicked my gun out.
[124:58.42]Oh, it was a little fucking baby gun.
[125:03.64]Still full health somehow.
[125:09.48]Ooh, I got him.
[125:11.08]What do you have for a gun?
[125:13.40]Damn it.
[125:13.82]I don't know.
[125:14.12]He didn't have anything.
[125:18.10]Whiskey, whiskey, whiskey, whiskey, whiskey.
[125:26.08]One more, one more.
[125:27.71]Shit!
[125:34.67]Come on!
[125:35.25]How many times are you going to punch a fucking guy?
[125:40.36]How do you go to the... There it is.
[125:42.78]Go with the bow.
[125:47.84]Boots, right?
[125:49.30]What is quick draw?
[125:52.42]Okay.
[125:53.70]That's new, I think.
[125:54.78]What is insatiable?
[125:56.80]Whiskey drunkenness vanishes 30% quicker.
[125:58.58]Huh.
[126:01.32]Interesting.
[126:04.68]That's from fuck you stream.
[126:10.66]Oh, hold on.
[126:11.00]I still want to do this too.
[126:17.14]Dude, it is kind of low.
[126:21.24]Where's my, um... Didn't I get a bow?
[126:26.23]Why did... Bow's not allowed on this server?
[126:30.13]Why can I not have any other secondaries or something?
[126:32.79]Oh, I get it.
[126:33.37]Okay.
[126:33.89]This was not in the game before.
[126:36.55]I understand now.
[126:37.26]No, I want knives.
[126:43.54]Whatever.
[126:44.30]He's gonna go die now.
[126:53.02]Let's punch the shit out of that guy.
[127:03.31]Alright, how do you- the bow.
[127:04.43]I forgot about the bow.
[127:05.51]You gotta like stand still if I remember for the bow to work at all.
[127:19.43]You gotta aim it really high too.
[127:37.96]Alright, so hold on.
[127:38.50]Let me, like, remember how to do this.
[127:41.96]So, just... One, two... Okay.
[127:44.62]If you're moving, is it more accurate if you're not moving?
[127:47.66]I think you have to, like, stand still.
[127:54.92]Trying to remember.
[128:01.63]Ah, shoot it in his hands!
[128:03.81]Oh!
[128:03.93]That only did ten damage to me.
[128:12.32]Fuck.
[128:17.22]FUCK!
[128:19.04]Freakin' free-for-all.
[128:22.66]It's just a mess.
[128:25.38]Am I- I can't- Am I spawned in this place?
[128:43.73]Too many people!
[128:45.15]Too many people!
[128:55.22]Gotta find a spot where I can just chill.
[128:57.52]There's a lot of people in this server for a free-for-all, by the way.
[129:00.68]There's 20 people in here on this little map.
[129:10.13]Shot his hat off.
[129:13.29]Alright, no more bow.
[129:14.23]There's too many people in this server to use the bow.
[129:16.66]We're gonna have to do, like, hatchet.
[129:17.94]Oh, no.
[129:18.18]Volcanic pistol's good.
[129:21.16]Volcanic pistol, knife, left-handed.
[129:24.46]And... Quickdraw.
[129:26.57]And that.
[129:27.01]Whatever it means.
[129:27.51]Who cares?
[129:36.08]Mmm...
[129:49.66]Maybe.
[129:57.04]I definitely want to go to a team server.
[129:58.40]20 person free-for-all is just, like, nightmarish.
[130:13.89]Ah!
[130:23.25]Guy's just waiting for somebody.
[130:30.88]It's over!
[130:35.04]Oh, that's kinda cool.
[130:35.88]You can actually see your... ...frags a minute, killstreaks, best accuracy.
[130:40.80]That's really awesome.
[130:41.59]That's new.
[130:41.93]Alright, is this still gonna be on free-for-all?
[130:51.81]I'll do one more free-for-all and then I'm going to do hatchet man with some knives.
[131:03.74]Knives and boots.
[131:13.53]Alright.
[131:14.45]Let's see if I remember how to use the hatchet.
[131:16.47]You can throw it too, can't you?
[131:21.59]I'm on his head.
[131:25.89]I guess I wasn't hitting anybody.
[131:30.16]I guess.
[131:31.42]You know.
[131:34.62]Oh, that's how you throw it.
[131:36.16]Good to know.
[131:43.05]I have to
[131:50.56]Ah, right in the head.
[131:55.05]Oh, shit.
[131:58.73]It's the fucking chaos.
[132:02.81]Give me that.
[132:03.31]Give me that.
[132:03.69]What?
[132:05.17]It went right by him.
[132:20.37]Give me something.
[132:21.21]No, I don't want to kick.
[132:32.57]I hit him right in the balls with that and it didn't kill him.
[132:40.88]Right in the gut.
[132:46.54]That was a nice gut check.
[132:49.48]Ugh.
[133:00.25]Give me your shit.
[133:00.95]That's my shit.
[133:01.79]Your shit is now my shit.
[133:05.30]I didn't get hit.
[133:07.28]Where's the golden box on this level?
[133:08.72]I don't remember.
[133:09.30]I think it's the other side.
[133:17.26]Shit!
[133:18.09]I just gave him a free hit.
[133:18.83]He doesn't even know there's a guy behind him with a knife.
[133:27.31]Finally.
[133:35.53]I just threw my only weapon.
[133:37.73]No, don't do it.
[133:41.80]I got him in the head.
[133:49.42]I accidentally killed that guy.
[133:56.29]The axe murderer chasing the axe murderer.
[133:59.85]And a random guy in the room.
[134:06.80]I'm the real axe murderer apparently.
[134:08.32]I didn't get hit one time.
[134:09.42]How is that possible?
[134:12.24]He jumped right when I threw it.
[134:17.63]Terrible place to go.
[134:27.85]I'm in second place?
[134:29.22]I'm going to have it stay that way.
[134:30.54]What am I doing?
[134:31.02]Throwing things.
[134:33.93]Hey, Anthony is good.
[134:35.59]Welcome back, Anthony.
[134:37.44]Thank you for your four months.
[134:42.36]Much appreciated.
[134:43.70]Hope you're having a swell day.
[135:00.79]Don't do it.
[135:01.47]Don't shoot me.
[135:02.74]He shot me.
[135:06.79]I can't stay away.
[135:07.87]Help.
[135:08.29]Atomic Tiki.
[135:09.83]For the eight months.
[135:12.69]Welcome back, Tiki.
[135:13.78]Thank you for your eight months, man.
[135:14.82]It's a very long time.
[135:18.84]Getting closer and closer to that one year which is crazy to think about.
[135:31.70]He needs like one more hit.
[135:33.44]But I'm dead too.
[135:39.78]Are there any new maps?
[135:41.30]I wonder if they've added new maps.
[135:42.20]I'm sure they have.
[135:52.01]Shit.
[135:53.87]Having fun, beer?
[135:55.93]I am, Black Spruce.
[135:58.25]You as well.
[135:58.71]Welcome back for four months.
[136:07.60]Ah, that was almost in the head.
[136:12.02]Damn it.
[136:16.22]That's why free-for-all is so dumb.
[136:21.06]You can just have a guy doing what I was just doing.
[136:23.38]Being a prick from like a hundred miles away.
[136:27.51]Well, I'm kind of in trouble here.
[136:36.45]First place.

[137:07.83]Dammit!
[137:09.05]Those are all so close.
[137:22.68]I wonder how many of you guys actually are in here.
[137:39.76]It's hard to get more than like two or three kills in a row.
[137:48.32]Because there's always going to be somebody behind you.
[137:51.26]Always.
[137:51.74]This guy's... Okay.
[137:55.01]Here we go.

[139:48.35]Here we go.
[140:11.89]Peacemaker baby peacemaker Guns shooting at all angles Give me the whiskey where is it?
[140:37.51]This thing's almost full again
[140:51.04]Machete.
[140:53.38]I've never used this before.
[140:54.30]This is new.
[140:59.85]No!
[141:00.33]I was like, trying to see what the fucking machete did.
[141:02.56]I didn't know if it had the same alt fire.
[141:26.84]That's got nothing Pick it up pick it up pick it up pick it up It's just a better axe.
[141:34.09]Oh, it's just like a better stats axe.
[141:36.11]Okay, that's good to know I forgot how much I fucking love this game.
[141:52.70]It's been too long.
[141:56.66]This has been far too long.
[142:12.11]I would like to get off this map.
[142:13.09]I'm going to change servers after this.
[142:20.74]There's a chance.
[142:26.29]I'll go with Mara's leg.
[142:30.53]Mara's leg.
[142:31.37]This guy's just shooting me.
[142:36.17]It's alright.
[142:36.69]Did I not?
[142:45.58]Oh, okay.
[142:46.94]That's overburdened.
[142:51.72]Now, what does this do again?
[142:52.52]Whiskey...
[142:55.27]Wow.
[142:57.47]No speed launch.
[142:58.39]I kind of want the boots, though.
[143:04.02]Or knives are a good alternative.
[143:15.45]Kill easy feet.
[143:18.01]Man, this guy with the rifle.
[143:21.99]Still up there.
[143:27.57]He's probably far away from everybody.
[143:33.41]Is there a guy in here?
[143:34.21]Is this the coach gun?
[143:43.90]No.
[143:49.36]I hate being in this room.
[143:50.04]You just get stuck in here.
[143:56.30]Every angle is a foe.
[143:58.92]Did he hit the machete?
[144:01.18]I think that guy hit the machete.
[144:10.47]If somebody can aim, gets the sharp, they can go to town.
[144:12.31]Yeah, they can.
[144:13.31]That gun is insane.
[144:22.13]It is insane!
[144:25.25]Derringer.
[144:25.61]I don't want a dumb Derringer.
[144:27.01]Don't give me that.
[144:27.59]This really is Reaper's gun.
[144:33.71]You're right.
[144:34.01]I know you say it.
[144:43.67]Withdraw.
[144:48.25]One more.
[144:52.00]Really?
[144:53.30]Interesting.
[145:06.95]Oh, damn.
[145:09.47]I went flying.
[145:12.33]There's no match for that one.
[145:14.69]I'm going to change this to left-handed.
[145:18.37]18 health.
[145:28.66]I'm dead.
[145:31.46]Oh!
[145:37.55]I shouldn't be shooting from that far away with this thing.
[145:42.45]That's a mistake.
[145:44.85]I didn't hit him.
[145:56.64]No, never mind.
[145:57.43]This thing is dumb.
[145:59.95]Give me the bow.
[146:11.22]Fucking free-for-all.
[146:20.11]I'm gone.
[146:22.89]Disconnect.
[146:23.73]We're going to a different server.
[146:25.93]I'm sick of free-for-all.
[146:30.10]I'm rage-quitting that server.
[146:31.40]Let's go to this one.
[146:46.33]There's more choices here.
[146:47.89]Oh god, my chat is freaking out when I... Oh boy, I can't see the... There we go.
[146:59.03]Now I can see it.
[147:03.35]Smith Carbine?
[147:04.19]I remember the Smith Carbine.
[147:05.37]You know, I'll try it.
[147:13.22]Can you do left-handed Smith Carbine?
[147:14.62]Oh no.
[147:21.71]So here we go, this is better.
[147:25.01]You're not at every angle in danger.
[147:28.49]You're only in some angles dangerous.
[147:36.64]We seem to be winning.
[147:38.92]How many bread team people do they have?
[147:42.98]Seems to be like a steam roll.
[147:49.87]I kind of want to join the other team.
[147:50.91]This doesn't seem very fair.
[147:52.81]Okay, I fucked it up again.
[148:19.07]We're on the boat.
[148:21.94]I'm on their team.
[148:24.00]Why did I switch to their team and now everyone... Oh, there they are.
[148:26.56]There's a guy.
[148:27.02]I need to turn... Whoa!
[148:34.87]Whoa!
[148:37.51]Whoa!
[148:38.03]Okay, he had a... Good, you got it under control.
[148:42.93]Good.
[148:48.95]Give me a drink.
[148:53.13]Didn't have any weapons.
[149:01.39]Come here, come here.
[149:02.37]You don't have any health.
[149:03.37]You have no health.
[149:11.27]Can I get a gun?
[149:11.99]Somebody drop a gun.
[149:15.95]Please.
[149:18.58]Where's her crate?
[149:23.86]No, there's two Germans.
[149:24.84]There we go.
[149:26.78]Oh, damn.
[149:27.24]This is... This is a good one.
[149:32.44]This is the really good one.
[149:33.54]I gotta be careful.
[149:38.05]I only have, like... I need health so bad.
[149:43.71]Is there whiskey anywhere down here?
[149:56.80]30 health.
[149:59.78]Now I finally have this McCarbine.
[150:02.44]It only took like 2 hours.
[150:05.11]And 25 seconds.
[150:08.45]That's my kill steal kill stealer.
[150:09.91]I actually don't really like this map out of all of them.
[150:21.46]I like the train map.
[150:22.42]That's like my favorite map.
[150:24.80]I'd love to go to the train.
[150:34.95]I feel like it was a little too dark.
[150:50.57]It's probably a little bit better for you guys too.
[150:56.27]Yeah, that train map is the best because it has the gold chest on the train.
[150:59.79]Awesome.
[151:01.24]It's fantastic.
[151:06.27]Got him.
[151:11.17]I'm so dead.
[151:12.57]What the fuck is going on in here?
[151:14.69]That's a Smith Carbine.
[151:23.30]What does whiskey do?
[151:23.90]Whiskey is health.
[151:28.49]It's like a little health pack.
[151:37.94]Nice shot.
[151:38.96]Good work.
[151:46.63]Gun sucks.
[151:47.91]Oh, this gun's good.
[151:49.49]You only get that one shot.
[151:53.55]Does like at least 70 to 80 damage.
[151:55.34]I really thought I got him.
[151:58.06]Whoa!
[151:59.78]Whoa!
[152:00.98]Whoa!
[152:02.34]Whoa!
[152:04.92]What the fuck was that?
[152:10.51]That was some odd shit, I'll tell you.
[152:13.40]20 tick rate.
[152:41.48]Shit.
[152:42.36]Sitting duck, sitting duck, sitting duck.
[152:48.92]Am I hitting him?
[152:53.70]There's a chest over there.
[152:56.34]There is a chest.
[152:57.68]I'm going for it.
[153:00.08]Protect me.
[153:01.08]Don't let him get me.
[153:15.60]That's a great gun too.
[153:33.64]Apparently they just clean it up.
[153:35.20]I guess.
[153:42.48]I'd like to see an enemy.
[153:43.64]Nope.
[153:45.26]Found an enemy.
[153:46.80]Can I get him?
[153:52.24]Ah!
[153:55.70]No!
[154:08.13]This is Battlefield 1.
[154:17.26]He's not dead.
[154:19.10]I guess that guy's alive.
[154:25.46]Shot him right in the back of his head area, his skull region.
[154:29.32]He seems to be alive, though.
[154:30.88]Ooh!
[154:54.18]Fill it up.
[154:55.28]Protect the box.
[154:58.42]Protect the box.
[155:00.85]And then open the box.
[155:01.97]Open it.
[155:06.07]Give me the... Yeah, I want to get some kills with this thing.
[155:08.71]This thing's awesome.
[155:17.80]Five minutes left on this map.
[155:19.85]I want to play on one of the other maps.
[155:21.75]The same, like, two maps.
[155:22.79]That was my problem before with this game.
[155:24.93]Was there was a bunch of maps that were in the game, but none of the servers ever ran them.
[155:33.87]Ten health.
[155:39.74]Is that it in here?
[155:44.04]Any more?
[155:45.28]Whiskey, come on.
[155:46.02]Let's get the whiskey over here, alright?
[155:52.99]Golden chest.
[155:56.25]This one's gold.
[155:57.47]If I take one hit, I'm dead.
[156:05.87]But it could be the best weapon in the whole game in there.
[156:18.52]Open it.
[156:19.84]Pump shotgun.
[156:20.74]Give me the shotgun.
[156:22.59]Oh, fuck.
[156:23.01]I'm overweight.
[156:23.41]How do I throw shit on the ground?
[156:24.97]There it is.
[156:27.59]There we go.
[156:29.63]Pump shotgun, boys.
[156:36.65]Look at that.
[156:37.03]There's a gun right there to get.
[156:38.98]What the fuck?
[156:40.72]I'm like trying to... What am I doing?
[156:42.26]I'm like, oh, come on.
[156:42.90]Look at this gun over here.
[156:45.22]That guy can't hear me.
[156:46.20]That guy can't hear me talking.
[156:48.61]Why did I do that?
[156:52.09]Spent all that time.
[156:52.87]To like role play for no reason.
[157:03.28]He's got the shotgun.
[157:05.49]I'm dead.
[157:16.28]Player place at me.
[157:21.38]At least I got the yellow thing back.
[157:24.86]Not a total loss.
[157:31.76]Ow.
[157:33.28]There's the shotgun.
[157:34.30]Got it back.
[157:37.18]Got the shotgun back.
[157:38.12]I'm actually surprised that didn't kill him.
[157:49.21]Don't scare me like that.
[158:01.88]What you got?
[158:02.66]Nothing?
[158:04.20]Nothing of interest?
[158:10.40]It's a bad place to be on the outside like this.
[158:13.74]Even worse place to be is up here.
[158:19.56]I'm a fat boy.
[158:20.40]See, I told you.
[158:25.08]That was such a dumb idea.
[158:26.60]Especially with a shotgun.
[158:27.40]You could turn a corner and kill somebody.
[158:28.63]Gotta get the cartoon music.
[158:41.17]It's important.
[158:47.44]I gotta get a kill with the cartoon music.
[159:00.80]Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink.
[159:01.98]Okay.
[159:08.12]Oh, shit face.
[159:08.89]Fantastic.
[159:10.63]I'm gonna go with skull field.
[159:16.49]Left-handed skull field.
[159:18.63]With the boots.
[159:19.92]And quick drop.
[159:24.50]We're gonna need some peeps.
[159:30.22]I can still hear the piano through the ceiling.
[159:34.99]I'm dead.
[159:36.19]Not quite.
[159:43.03]Can I come off?
[159:46.53]I don't care.
[159:47.09]I want to just die so I can do this.
[159:48.61]Yeah, you have to go get the Minecraft royalty-free cartoon music.
[159:55.12]That's right.
[159:57.79]Who's up here?
[160:07.36]This actually is my favorite gun.
[160:12.90]Okay, I know where to go.
[160:15.58]See, I'm just spinning around.
[160:23.18]Eight health.
[160:25.32]I got stuck on the fucking staircase.
[160:39.27]Ten seconds left.
[160:40.23]I got to get a kill.
[160:41.45]And then I want to go to a new, better map.
[160:44.48]Not the boat level 5,000 times.
[160:45.52]Oh, that's over.
[160:52.20]Let's see where this is going.
[160:53.10]If it's going to a better server, a better, uh, spot.
[161:00.94]Hold on.
[161:02.62]Do this.
[161:03.68]Do that.
[161:04.02]Let's see where we're going.
[161:07.08]The girl I left behind.
[161:09.19]No, we're going to the same, like, the same fucking three dumbass servers.
[161:13.57]Not servers, uh, maps.
[161:17.73]We keep going to the same places.
[161:25.63]The server's not full.
[161:30.55]Depot.
[161:31.27]What's the bank?
[161:31.85]I don't know what the bank is fun to.
[161:35.22]I'm just not sure what we're actually on.
[161:43.30]I mean, unfortunately, there really is only, like, four servers that have players in them.
[161:48.32]Like, there's, like, six that actually have people playing.
[162:02.18]Oh, well.
[162:04.62]Looks like you're staying here.
[162:13.85]Staying here.
[162:19.99]Oh, this is going to be a little bit better because it's only going to be on... It's not going to be free-for-all.
[162:32.52]Desperados.
[162:35.98]Starting soon, changing games.
[162:37.24]Yeah, you gotta do them both at the same time.
[162:42.47]Gotta change games and start soon.
[162:48.85]I'm on your team, man.
[162:51.89]Get that guy in the leg like four times.
[162:58.87]Three times.
[163:11.49]What like what what the fuck happened there I Will be angry about that
[163:38.96]Shoot!
[163:40.20]Ooh, he got headshot.
[163:41.76]From what?
[163:45.18]Should've flash banged him first.
[163:46.60]Yeah, he should've.
[163:47.31]I don't know what I was thinking.
[163:52.29]When you open in a box, you always gotta keep your eyes out.
[163:54.67]Otherwise that'll happen to you every time.
[164:06.36]I thought you were- ooh, that guy's got a rifle too.
[164:11.54]Really?
[164:11.82]I thought he was AFK.
[164:14.93]No, I'm not gonna- I'm it.
[164:22.31]There's another guy right there.
[164:24.46]That guy was the same color as the snow.
[164:42.28]Bullshit.
[164:53.73]Bullshit.
[164:57.03]Red box.
[164:58.73]I know what that means.
[165:00.51]I'm gonna get the peacemaker.
[165:05.61]What did I tell you?
[165:06.71]I wasn't paying attention.
[165:08.69]And it got me killed.
[165:19.10]Is this the monthly Jerma stream?

[166:14.97]Got him that time.
[166:15.61]Come on, your friend's going to do the same dumb thing, isn't he?
[166:18.40]I wish I could get up there from here.
[166:24.96]It's Thursday.
[166:25.92]Well, yeah.
[166:27.80]What if you're watching this on Sunday?
[166:31.90]You'd be like, oh yeah, it is Sunday.
[166:33.98]You're right.
[166:41.00]Where's my face?
[166:42.82]It's gone.
[166:45.06]It's just gone, dude.
[166:47.06]I don't know where it went.
[166:47.76]I don't know what happened to it.
[166:52.46]I want to grab that gun, but it's up there.
[167:02.55]Will it still be there if I get up here in time?
[167:04.83]Where's the shotgun?
[167:08.39]It's gone.
[167:10.78]It's gone.
[167:11.42]Don't scare me like that.
[167:24.46]Alright, maybe a couple more.
[167:25.34]This last round, I'm probably going to call it.
[167:27.66]I'm starving.
[167:30.92]Tomorrow night is going to be a couple of different things.
[167:33.74]We're going to play a pirate game tomorrow.
[167:35.16]It should be really fun.
[167:36.91]I'm looking forward to it.
[167:38.89]It's not Ravenscry, I promise.
[167:40.41]I just freaked out and alt-tabbed.
[167:47.15]How am I still alive?
[167:48.79]Wow.
[167:50.61]Even after alt-tabbing the game, I can still play.
[167:53.09]I'm this guy with fists.
[168:01.07]His friend didn't even help him.
[168:04.63]That was shocking.
[168:05.53]Did you hear that?
[168:11.49]Where's the burp emote?
[168:18.21]That should have hit him right in the chest.
[168:19.47]That was fucking bullshit.
[168:35.08]Be brave.
[168:37.54]Yeah, it should be a good time.
[168:41.64]If it's as fun as I could imagine it being.
[168:43.94]It should be.
[168:44.42]A grand time.
[168:53.46]Back in here.
[168:54.14]Alright, maybe I should just get the dynamite or something.
[169:02.12]I love this thing too much.
[169:05.94]I want the golden gun from 007.
[169:09.06]That thing is disgusting.
[169:10.40]It's the guaranteed kill no matter what as long as you hit somebody.
[169:20.85]Turn to the pirate theme song.
[169:24.39]He was behind me!
[169:25.85]Come around, get this guy!
[169:27.41]Oh, I can't believe it!
[169:31.88]Oh!
[169:54.06]I need help so bad.
[170:00.57]So bad.
[170:01.91]If I can't jump from there I'll die.
[170:09.59]Fuck.
[170:11.24]You go down there first.
[170:13.60]He's looking for you.
[170:14.26]Did you get him?
[170:16.94]No, he died.
[170:19.79]There's a rifle.
[170:20.51]Give me the rifle.
[170:21.93]Whoa!
[170:22.57]No!
[170:23.03]Fuck!
[170:23.57]Damn it!
[170:24.13]Shit!
[170:24.59]Ass!
[170:28.65]I didn't know another guy was right, but I thought that was a body.
[170:30.40]I thought that was a corpse from one of his friends.
[170:32.20]Ah!
[170:34.02]That was the sniper rifle right there, too.
[170:38.22]You good?
[170:44.04]You're good.
[170:46.04]Move as a team.
[170:57.69]Watch the profanity, man.
[170:59.21]Oh, what a dick.
[171:03.33]I didn't know there were two of you here.
[171:05.93]I wouldn't have even gone down there if I knew there was two people.
[171:09.89]What a mistake.
[171:12.03]What a total mistake.
[171:13.81]What an absolute total mistake.
[171:16.01]I'll never make that mistake.
[171:17.03]When I'm president, I'll never make a mistake like that, I can tell you.
[171:31.38]Watch me!
[171:32.66]I can do that too.
[171:34.12]Nice.
[171:42.79]Why don't you upload stream highlights?
[171:52.72]I'm going to.
[171:55.10]There are a lot of stream highlights that are going to be going up on my channel very, very, very, very soon.
[172:01.00]Very soon.
[172:03.94]Very soon.
[172:05.02]You know what I'm saying?
[172:10.89]Headshot his head off.
[172:17.43]The guy with the knife up here.
[172:19.21]I'm the one that dies.
[172:20.95]Of course.
[172:22.81]Guy comes up with a knife, then I get headshot.
[172:27.52]So inv- so inva- so invagarating and agrivating.
[172:32.52]What's the word to determine if you're like upset about something?
[172:34.00]Ina- inaugurating?
[172:40.00]Wow. It spawned me right here.
[172:47.00]I need to get up there and get that fucking gun.
[172:52.00]How do you get up there?
[173:04.44]Don't remember.
[173:04.94]Negative go round.
[173:08.77]Round and round the merry-go-round.
[173:14.63]Please pick it up.
[173:16.29]Please.
[173:23.78]And he shot him in the back.
[173:27.84]Stabbed him in the back.
[173:31.61]Where is your honor?
[173:37.24]Do you have none?
[173:44.51]Red chest.
[173:45.05]Red chest.
[173:46.29]Open it.
[173:47.13]Please.
[173:52.40]Take a peacemaker again.
[174:01.91]I participated.
[174:02.53]Tinder update?
[174:04.39]You want another Tinder update?
[174:05.31]Alright, here's a Tinder update.
[174:07.49]Uh, this guy's just teleporting around everywhere.
[174:09.75]It's okay, he died.
[174:14.95]I haven't actually been really using it.
[174:17.64]Not that much recently.
[174:21.56]Only very slightly.
[174:22.60]I gotta stop giving a shit.
[174:28.40]I'm real.
[174:36.14]Just got like stuck.
[174:37.10]I didn't even know he was there.
[174:38.16]Ah, it would have been great.
[174:39.92]I mean, I still match with people, but I don't really... I really kind of just don't give a shit anymore.
[174:47.83]I gave a shit for like a couple weeks.
[174:50.03]Then I realized it's just like the regular dating scene.
[174:53.55]When nobody actually wants to talk to anybody.
[174:56.69]People do it to like boost their egos.
[175:00.98]You see how many people I matched with?
[175:02.82]I matched with this person.
[175:04.18]Swipe, swipe, swipes.
[175:05.24]I matched.
[175:10.17]There you go.
[175:10.95]This is the Tinder update.
[175:17.20]Ah, show yourself.
[175:30.82]I'm in trouble.
[175:44.24]Still alive.
[175:48.38]That's very insightful.
[175:50.47]No, but that's just like the way it is.
[175:52.05]He has to die.
[176:16.92]You gotta be here with me, man.
[176:18.04]This guy's gonna come up and kill me.
[176:21.64]No, he's not gonna.
[176:23.63]He's not gonna.
[176:26.43]Wherever the hell he's going.
[176:27.25]I will find him.
[176:30.79]And I will kill him.
[176:34.04]Five minutes.
[176:49.92]That was very distracting.
[176:51.13]I didn't know what he was doing.
[176:52.33]Oh, well.
[176:53.93]It's okay.
[176:54.29]I'll get it back.
[176:54.77]I'm going to go to Shetty.
[177:01.63]Run around with this like an asshole for a couple minutes.
[177:23.20]Got him!
[177:24.50]Got a three-piece.
[177:25.68]I'll take it.
[177:31.30]I was gonna throw it, but I should've done it.
[177:40.90]I heard the clunk when it hit the wall.
[177:47.83]Wanna get one V1 with me?
[178:00.68]I just got humiliated.
[178:02.18]I could have just shot him.
[178:13.47]Fuck.
[178:17.46]How's Otto doing?
[178:18.08]Otto's doing great.
[178:24.70]Oh, I'm so hungry right now.
[178:25.70]Somebody just said something about chicken nuggets in the chat, and I just want chicken nuggets now.
[178:31.04]I want chicken nuggets so bad right now.
[178:45.23]I would do anything for a chicken nugget.
[178:48.91]Like a Wendy's chicken nugget right now.
[178:50.71]Are they open?
[178:51.15]Are they open right now?
[178:53.21]I don't think so.
[178:54.31]How late is it?
[178:54.75]Is it too late?
[178:59.61]I might seriously just go to one of these right now.
[179:04.51]Oh, that was multiple headshots.
[179:07.94]If I do... Oh, that's another headshot.
[179:10.20]That's another one.
[179:14.60]You know, I would like it if somebody would help me there.
[179:20.52]Money's close at midnight.
[179:21.44]What time is it?
[179:22.80]Shit.
[179:23.86]It's 1145.
[179:24.40]I don't think I'm gonna make the cut there, guys.
[179:35.47]Get mid-match and just go.
[179:41.73]Shit.
[179:42.16]Come here.
[179:43.70]None of those hit.
[179:45.50]None of them.
[179:46.10]None of them hit.
[179:46.94]None of them hit.
[179:47.78]None of them.
[179:48.82]None of them.
[179:51.04]That's why I don't fan the hammer.
[179:54.24]It's very erratic.
[179:57.06]There he is.
[179:57.74]I'm dead.
[179:58.10]I don't think I do his prey.
[180:00.82]He thinks I went... I still have time?
[180:06.83]No.
[180:07.73]I don't know where the nearest Wendy's near me is.
[180:13.93]Gonna take me like at least 15 minutes to like order.
[180:16.11]I'm gonna get like hundreds of nuggets and a bunch of junior bacon cheeseburgers and... Oh, I'm gonna be such a fat fuck.
[180:28.24]I have- I have really healthy food in my fridge.
[180:30.98]I've got like salmon and, you know, I've got- I've got some spinach and some kale and nice white rice.
[180:38.24]Nope.
[180:39.32]I could make that, but... I'm going to McDonald's.
[180:43.05]The most miserable place on Earth.
[180:47.39]I'm going to McDonald's, Burger King, or Wendy's.
[180:49.53]The most miserable places on Earth.
[180:55.36]They're not really, though.
[180:57.58]I don't... I really don't like to eat fast food.
[180:59.46]Something about it.
[181:03.06]I never liked it.
[181:04.30]Whatever.
[181:05.10]Somebody said chicken nuggets in the chat, so I have to eat them.
[181:13.06]McDonald's is where human decency goes to die.
[181:17.60]Dude, a plain McDouble.
[181:21.28]Really not that bad.
[181:22.82]Just a plain McDouble.
[181:25.69]Cheese.
[181:27.47]Now I want a McDouble.
[181:28.53]I'm gonna get like four of those.
[181:32.11]Good, the bad, and the you.
[181:32.77]Let's see.
[181:33.45]Darren, Darren, Darren.
[181:39.44]Darren, Darren, Darren, Darren, Darren, Darren.
[181:44.38]Alright, guys.
[181:45.72]That's gonna be it for the stream.
[181:51.64]So, thanks everybody for watching.
[181:53.62]I appreciate it.
[181:54.20]Thanks to all the people that have been sticking around this whole time.
[181:57.64]Sorry it was a little erratic.
[181:58.94]It started with that GTA-like driver game, which I thought was funny.
[182:04.11]Didn't really have a plan tonight, but I got a plan tomorrow.
[182:07.35]So...
[182:08.79]Take it easy, everybody.
[182:10.19]Thanks for watching.
[182:11.11]I'm going to go stuff my face with Wendy's, McDonald's, or Burger King.
[182:16.03]It might even be all three.
[182:19.21]Good one-hour stream.
[182:20.69]Did you get here an hour ago?
[182:21.69]I've been streaming for like three or four hours.
[182:26.45]What are you talking about?
[182:29.06]What are you talking about?
[182:32.46]Yeah.
[182:33.00]Good night, guys.
[182:34.18]I will see you all tomorrow.
[182:36.22]Hang ten.
[182:39.14]Goodbye.
[182:40.58]And good luck.
[182:42.38]Have a good one.
[182:44.20]Good night.
