[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.53]Just because.
[00:04.11]Alright, so now you're in the party?
[00:09.09]Okay, we're getting PlayStationed.
[00:14.87]Yeah, that doesn't matter.
[00:16.52]Alright, so join the party.
[00:18.90]Here we are.
[00:19.36]Okay.
[00:21.50]Now play together.
[00:23.88]Play together is a feature that makes it easy to play multiplayer games with other players that play in a part of the day.
[00:27.06]Okay!
[00:29.86]How do you want to play together?
[00:32.07]Join game session.
[00:38.65]What's the method?
[00:40.85]Mm-hmm.
[00:42.45]And then join friend's game.
[00:43.59]Oh, okay, okay.
[00:47.29]That would make sense.
[00:49.47]Alright, so I'm just going to load up into free roam and just try to jump into your game.
[00:56.14]That would make sense, wouldn't it?
[00:59.88]While we're doing this, have you played through all the single player yet in this?
[01:03.77]I have not.
[01:04.47]I'm like 40% of the way through.
[01:06.33]Okay, so you're on like chapter three then?
[01:10.35]Yeah, I just barely am like into chapter three, I think.
[01:16.55]Yeah, there's a lot left.
[01:17.52]I mean, there's a hot air balloon.
[01:20.90]Really?
[01:21.26]There's a hot air balloon?
[01:23.18]No, that was you.
[01:26.11]There's an Elvis impersonator.
[01:27.67]I love those things.
[01:30.88]That's some of my favorite means of travel.
[01:32.84]I'm glad you're bringing it up.
[01:34.62]Yeah, I want to know all about that in a couple minutes.
[01:37.16]But before we do that, I want to also say there's a game called Rust that just implemented hot air balloons.
[01:43.14]Oh, my God.
[01:44.12]Are you serious?
[01:45.27]Yeah, I swear to God.
[01:48.79]Alright, give me one second.
[01:50.39]I have to say hello to somebody.
[01:52.03]Somebody just knocked on my door.
[01:53.09]I've got to say hello to them.
[01:53.93]Hold on.
[01:55.07]Hey, it's you guys!
[01:55.91]It's my stream!
[01:56.71]My stream!
[01:57.83]Chat, I'm half expecting this to be... It's not.
[02:02.41]I just want to say hello.
[02:06.64]Playing Red Dead Online with Vinny.
[02:10.68]In case you didn't know, just want to make sure that you're aware of that.
[02:12.48]Hey, how you doing?
[02:16.77]Vinny Vinesauce.
[02:18.40]That was fucking really good.
[02:23.04]That was really good.
[02:24.38]I had to come back and say that.
[02:26.42]I'm half expecting this to be a skit.
[02:28.13]And you threw me all off.
[02:28.95]I had a fucking clown here.
[02:29.91]I just sent him home.
[02:34.07]Hey, that's Vinny!
[02:34.89]Wait, is that Vinny?
[02:37.42]Oh, that's Vinny!
[02:39.69]Vinny!
[02:41.09]Hey, I made it.
[02:42.65]Let me see your character.
[02:43.47]What is this character?
[02:44.79]My character is loathsome looking.
[02:46.59]Let me see yours.
[02:48.78]Yeah, I hate my character.
[02:49.84]At least your dude looks like... You're about to say me.
[02:55.16]You're about to say looks like me.
[02:56.16]You think that's what I look like?
[02:57.58]No.
[02:59.78]Well, hey, I mean, if anything, we could be in a band called the Stooges.
[03:02.44]I look like Iggy Pop.
[03:03.40]You look like the drummer.
[03:04.44]So I guess we're good.
[03:06.36]Let me add you to a posse.
[03:08.02]I think we can do that now.
[03:10.21]No, this looks like the taxi driver from the Muppets.
[03:14.29]We're gonna form... Don't make fun of my face ever again!
[03:17.92]Alright, so now we're friends.
[03:20.66]That was a friend punch.
[03:21.72]So, get your hat.
[03:24.52]You look like Solid Snake from the third one.
[03:28.64]Squeeze the hog.
[03:32.31]Oh yeah, I started the cycle.
[03:33.25]Oh, we got a posse.
[03:36.16]Must be able to pay fee to create a posse.
[03:38.90]Must be able to pay fee?
[03:41.02]Fuck you, Rockstar.
[03:43.60]That's like a funny laugh out loud Rockstar is taking payment joke, right?
[03:47.59]Uh-huh.
[03:49.53]Oh, it's real though.
[03:50.23]Okay, you're a temporary posse.
[03:52.31]That's free.
[03:54.19]Posse.
[03:57.73]Your tent has been moved to Vinesauce's camp.
[04:02.52]We'll set up a camp.
[04:03.14]So we share a camp now.
[04:05.30]Yeah.
[04:06.16]Let's just do a quick test.
[04:07.40]Alright.
[04:07.66]Let me use your hat though.
[04:09.58]Alright.
[04:10.24]I'm ready.
[04:11.00]I'm ready for my picture.
[04:13.10]Alright.
[04:13.30]Friendly fire is confirmed off.
[04:15.44]Which is good because I didn't know if that was gonna work.
[04:17.58]I'm gonna have to figure out which one of our hats I like better on my head.
[04:21.55]I hate my hat.
[04:22.45]So... Where did you get this thing?
[04:25.77]It was a default jabroni hat.
[04:28.95]So is this one.
[04:29.69]Then why is mine dirtier than yours?
[04:32.63]I don't know, actually.
[04:33.51]What have you been doing?
[04:34.27]What have you been rolling around in the mud?
[04:36.43]I think so.
[04:37.69]Last time I played, I think that's what I did.
[04:39.86]Alright, let's go have fun.
[04:43.50]Yeah, I don't know where that is.
[04:46.64]So there's a bunch of random missions.
[04:47.70]Have you done any online at all?
[04:49.60]I've done some of the missions online, yeah.
[04:51.14]I've done a deathmatch.
[04:52.02]I've done...
[04:54.01]some of the team-based stuff.
[04:55.17]It was fun.
[04:55.75]I enjoyed it.
[04:56.77]Cool, cool.
[04:57.95]Whoa!
[04:58.25]What was that?
[04:59.15]Lightning?
[04:59.45]There's a lightning mission starting.
[05:02.98]We have horses, don't we?
[05:05.36]Somewhere we have horses.
[05:07.32]I think I have horses coming from behind here.
[05:10.16]This is interesting.
[05:12.06]Showdown series, large match.
[05:13.66]Oh, this is the stuff I did.
[05:14.74]This stuff is pretty fun.
[05:18.72]Oh, nice, nice, nice.
[05:20.24]I want to just ride off and like... You want to just like lasso people and torture them?
[05:25.16]Oh yeah, what's the first thing you want to do when you get online?
[05:28.96]Why don't we torture people?
[05:30.34]That sounds like fun.
[05:34.87]Like this guy.
[05:38.73]He's pulling out his gun.
[05:41.01]Well, we killed him.
[05:42.13]He's dead.
[05:44.31]I guess we did torture him.
[05:46.13]He was torturing his life.
[05:48.75]We got a murder trophy?
[05:50.27]I guess that means we're bad.
[05:52.43]Yeah, I was wondering why.
[05:53.95]Are you a good guy or are you a bad guy in these games?
[05:58.44]I'm more or less a good guy online, though I've done some horrendously questionable things.
[06:02.44]How about you?
[06:03.82]I'm always a good guy.
[06:05.90]Like, no matter what.
[06:06.88]So any opportunity that presents itself, I always do the right thing.
[06:10.88]Okay.
[06:11.18]Is that going to be a problem for this stream?
[06:14.92]I'm not sure.
[06:17.01]We may have some disagreements.
[06:18.27]I fed someone to an alligator.
[06:20.99]Just doing a good deed over here.
[06:21.93]Hold on.
[06:22.17]Okay.
[06:23.51]I see this good deed.
[06:25.87]I hear gunshot.
[06:26.75]Okay, that's a good deed.
[06:27.60]Yeah, just trying to do good deeds over here.
[06:31.84]Yeah, that seems like it was a good deed for sure.
[06:34.46]I just ran past that guy's horse.
[06:36.28]That poor, frightened, scared horse.
[06:37.80]He just killed its owner.
[06:39.70]Yeah, I was trying to help that guy.
[06:42.41]There was flies around his head and I was trying to get rid of them.
[06:46.53]This is like his camp.
[06:48.96]Oh, man, that guy just goodguided me.
[06:51.98]Get that good guy down there.
[06:54.04]Oh, I got him.
[06:55.32]Alright, can you like, can you help me?
[06:58.80]Yeah, let me find you.
[07:01.18]Oh, do I, do I, is this like left for dead?
[07:05.27]I think so.
[07:05.63]Yeah, you're bleeding out and you're dead.
[07:08.29]Too late.
[07:09.79]That guy's whole camp just disappeared.
[07:18.09]I'm going to do an emote.
[07:19.03]I'm going to wave.
[07:19.57]I want to be friends.
[07:20.97]You want to be friends with this guy?
[07:22.05]Alright.
[07:22.21]I'm going to try to be friends with him.
[07:24.23]I'm going to offer the twig of peace.
[07:28.07]What's the emote wheel?
[07:30.01]It's definitely not that.
[07:31.01]You hold L2.
[07:32.15]You press R1 and then you get an emote.
[07:34.59]Oh, okay.
[07:34.91]And then you can do an emote wheel which is... Alright.
[07:37.39]Right.
[07:37.55]Right.
[07:37.73]Yeah.
[07:38.63]Yeah.
[07:40.98]Alright, please, like, tell this guy, like, over the fake voice chat.
[07:44.88]Oh, never mind.
[07:47.84]What?
[07:48.98]Nothing.
[07:49.56]I didn't try to do anything.
[07:51.30]Oh, I think he has his flag up.
[07:52.74]I don't think we can do anything to him.
[07:56.57]Okay, I didn't know that was a thing, but I'm glad it is.
[07:58.53]I'm gonna farewell handshake this guy.
[08:01.01]Never mind.
[08:01.95]We can't.
[08:03.93]We tried.
[08:09.49]Ooh, hey, it's just like GTA Online.
[08:11.52]Excuse me, partner.
[08:12.98]Where do you think you're going?
[08:17.95]Open the table, quick.
[08:20.69]Don't let him get away.
[08:24.84]I don't think we can do a whole lot with this dude.
[08:29.34]I feel like the game has some safety checks in place.
[08:34.69]This dude wants to be peaceful and we're just trying to run him down with our horses.
[08:40.99]Alright.
[08:42.31]That was fun.
[08:43.82]Yeah, I enjoyed that for all 30 seconds of it.
[08:46.84]There's another thing here.
[08:47.80]There's like a... There's a whole... I said a waypoint.
[08:50.06]I don't know if you can see it, but there seems to be a group of people.
[08:52.43]What are we doing?
[08:54.69]I just figured I was going to come over here.
[08:56.39]I'm not a very good driver.
[08:59.51]My horse does not have the load-bearing potential for this kind of thing, right?
[09:02.69]It's alright.
[09:03.41]Trust me.
[09:03.91]If I drive one of these cars, I'm going into a bench post.
[09:08.88]Alright.
[09:09.16]Fair enough.
[09:14.38]So...
[09:16.02]You know, hot air balloon?
[09:18.72]Yeah, pretty much how it works is you go up in the air.
[09:23.20]And why are these people all ghosts?
[09:25.44]I don't know.
[09:25.86]What is this?
[09:26.48]They're made of vapor.
[09:28.59]Why are they like Metal Gear Solid invisible?
[09:31.59]Why are they able to shoot us?
[09:32.95]Hold on, I'll take care of this.
[09:40.09]Wait, they're ghosts, but they can shoot us still.
[09:43.11]How does it- what?
[09:43.61]That doesn't make any sense.
[09:44.75]Kill the NPC, quick!
[09:46.27]Kill the NPC!
[09:48.11]Trying.
[09:50.31]Fuck their flight path, Giver.
[09:52.89]Just like the Crossroads back in like the early 2000s.
[09:56.01]He's the Irishman.
[09:57.03]What's his name?
[09:57.65]Uh, Sean.
[09:59.73]Yeah, I don't understand why we can't interact with these guys, but they can interact with us.
[10:04.52]That seems very unfair.
[10:05.78]Who the fuck is this?
[10:07.12]Oh, this is fair!
[10:10.56]Oh, did- wait, wait, did you just do that?
[10:14.30]Why are ghosts... No, I didn't do that.
[10:16.24]The ghost bullies are taking care of all this.
[10:18.10]Alright, well, we found... We found a strange happening here.
[10:26.22]This online doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me right now.
[10:28.60]So they're in a different server.
[10:29.68]They're able to interact with our server.
[10:32.23]I don't know.
[10:35.62]There's a mission here, but we can't do it because we're in a danger zone or something.
[10:39.93]Oh, that's too bad.
[10:40.55]You know what?
[10:41.33]I was going to just sabotage their vehicles.
[10:45.13]Vehicles?
[10:45.71]Yeah.
[10:47.65]I can't even sabotage their vehicles?
[10:49.99]Oh, that guy got out of the phase for a second.
[10:51.95]No.
[10:52.83]I saw that.
[10:53.95]I saw it.
[10:54.25]This is really like Westworld shit.
[10:57.22]Yeah, it's kind of not fair.
[10:59.00]Have a look.
[11:00.67]So hot air balloons, you fill them with air and they go up into the sky.
[11:03.81]Yeah, and then you eat all the passengers to stay alive.
[11:07.33]Okay, cool.
[11:08.51]Oh, I mean like in a video game.
[11:11.75]In one of those video games where you eat... What's a video game where you eat stuff when you're traveling?
[11:24.55]Do you have any idea?
[11:26.03]No.
[11:26.75]No, that's just...
[11:30.19]When you fly around... It's an Oregon trail.
[11:32.05]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[11:32.99]Except that was... You drive on... You're in a... On an Oregon... On the trail.
[11:38.49]So, yeah.
[11:39.13]That's, um... You know, I, uh... I don't... That's cannibalism.
[11:44.45]That's fucking disgusting.
[11:45.29]Why would I ever... Oh, boy.
[11:46.90]What have I done?
[11:48.82]I'm assuming there's a lot to the story that I'm unaware of.
[11:51.70]So, I'm just gonna let you do you.
[11:54.00]No.
[11:54.60]No, I just... I... You know, it's been a while since I was in the air, so...
[12:00.31]Jerma, do you have a horse reviver?
[12:02.01]I think I just killed my horse.
[12:03.81]I killed mine too.
[12:06.55]Are you serious?
[12:08.29]Yeah, I jumped off the cliff.
[12:09.59]Did you jump off this one?
[12:11.15]Yeah, I jumped off this one.
[12:21.34]I hope you have horse insurance.
[12:23.38]I think I do.
[12:24.14]Well, whatever.
[12:24.64]These are like shitty default free ones.
[12:27.66]Yeah, but I named mine Oatmeal.
[12:32.67]Oh, no, don't shoot Oatmeal!
[12:35.99]There you go.
[12:36.99]If anything, at least turn him into food.
[12:40.80]It won't let me stab Oatmeal.
[12:43.22]Well, now we have to walk.
[12:45.12]Alright, well, there's a whole gang hideout over here.
[12:47.54]You want to go kill some stuff?
[12:48.62]Yeah, let's go light some people up.
[12:51.48]Okay.
[12:56.63]I think I can skin my horse.
[13:01.05]Can I skin your horse?
[13:02.15]No.
[13:04.45]I think these are the bad guys.
[13:06.51]Yeah, these are the bad guys.
[13:10.19]So we can take this place out.
[13:11.05]That guy was like a pinball machine.
[13:15.16]That was pretty good.
[13:16.58]That was really good.
[13:17.84]We got this.
[13:20.80]That's how a cowboy says yes, just in case you didn't know.
[13:23.04]They say urn-hern.
[13:24.04]Urn-hern?
[13:25.68]Yes.
[13:26.24]They say urn-hern.
[13:28.16]Urn-hern.
[13:30.18]Mister.
[13:38.28]No more tears.
[13:39.19]I just fucking died.
[13:40.49]No.
[13:42.33]I was too busy paying attention to urn-hern.
[13:44.69]I'm sorry.
[13:45.35]Ernest Hearn.
[13:46.19]The local fucking dentist.
[13:49.98]You know what I mean, Vern?
[13:52.48]I've become a bit of a psychopath, it seems.
[13:57.54]Ernest, Ernest.
[13:59.98]Alright, I'm coming to rescue you, don't worry.
[14:05.04]Don't worry, if you die, I've got a horse reviver, I'll take care of you.
[14:12.46]Okay.
[14:12.90]It works on people, too.
[14:14.35]Same drug.
[14:16.47]There's only a couple dudes left, so we just have to kill the main dude who's on the docks, I guess.
[14:22.41]Alright, so you mean stab him a hundred times.
[14:26.05]Watch this.
[14:29.04]Alright, we got him.
[14:32.34]Fuck him up!
[14:33.96]Ooh, that was... Okay, he's in the water now.
[14:38.58]So we split every piece of treasure, every treasure chest we find, it's 50-50, right?
[14:42.73]Yes.
[14:42.83]Yes, we do.
[14:47.50]Alright, come watch me stab this guy.
[14:54.11]Oh, you're fighting the main guy.
[14:55.13]I'm fighting his uncle out here.
[14:57.73]I just slit his throat.
[14:59.97]You got the guy with lumbago?
[15:01.43]Alright.
[15:04.88]Wait, wait, wait.
[15:06.00]Don't touch anything.
[15:09.58]Okay, how many hats did he have?
[15:11.70]He only had one and it says you cannot store this hat.
[15:14.35]Well, we're going to have to cut it in half.
[15:15.57]Because that's the only way that's fair.
[15:19.75]It says here you can get your free Arabian horse from the strawberry stables.
[15:23.97]Someone in chat said so.
[15:25.21]If you want to get a non-shitty horse in a bit, maybe that'll be a good thing to do on stream.
[15:29.66]That'll be a good fun thing to do.
[15:31.58]Yeah, fun activity.
[15:33.40]Is there any loot box in here or something?
[15:36.62]There's a cabinet.
[15:38.06]It costs three rockstar gold to open, yeah.
[15:41.62]Once purchased, looted, or crafted consumables.
[15:43.48]It's so dark over here.
[15:46.34]What?
[15:46.60]Oh, I got a guy.
[15:47.26]There's a guy in there.
[15:49.46]Okay, that's cool.
[15:49.90]What the fuck?
[15:50.28]Where'd you get that guy from?
[15:51.28]Oh, that was the guy that... He was in the cabinet.
[15:55.48]I guess, like, we just get to take this guy, I think.
[15:58.06]Maybe we can sell him somewhere?
[16:00.94]Pretty sure we can do that.
[16:01.92]Yeah, let's do that.
[16:02.92]Oh, I dropped him.
[16:03.90]I dropped him in the water, and... That's, uh... You have to bring the iPhone store.
[16:09.18]The water damage is, like, you just can't fucking recover it.
[16:11.78]Oh, shit.
[16:12.86]I just got disconnected.
[16:16.20]And just like that, you're gone.
[16:18.60]Did you get DC'd?
[16:21.82]I don't know if I got DC'd, but I can't loot anybody right now.
[16:26.84]The cycle never ends.
[16:29.35]You would think Vegas would have good internet.
[16:32.29]I got great internet at the moment.
[16:35.59]It's just for some reason my connection to Rockstar, I don't know why.
[16:38.23]I'm coming back.
[16:43.09]Okay.
[16:45.97]This is what was happening to me before, too.
[16:47.99]Are you still in game?
[16:49.61]I'm still in game.
[16:50.69]What the heck?
[16:52.43]Let me know when you're back online.
[16:53.51]I can invite you.
[16:57.72]What the... Can I swear on you?
[17:00.80]Do you swear?
[17:02.44]I swear a little bit.
[17:03.10]You swear a little?
[17:03.70]Yeah.
[17:05.48]Shit.
[17:08.00]Jeremy.
[17:08.44]What the shit?
[17:09.66]I'm sorry.
[17:10.08]Jeremy.
[17:12.28]You know, we shouldn't even, like, by, you know, by rights, we shouldn't even be friends.
[17:15.63]I'm a New York Yankees guy.
[17:16.85]You're a Boston Redskins guy.
[17:20.27]What?
[17:21.77]Yep.
[17:23.86]I can't believe you just fucking said that.
[17:25.80]I know.
[17:26.42]I know.
[17:29.26]The truth is, though, I don't really care.
[17:31.04]But, uh, you know, I was told I was a Yankees fan when I was a child.
[17:33.99]And, um...
[17:35.69]I was told I was a Yankees fan.
[17:38.09]Yeah, I was told that I was.
[17:40.25]And I, you know, watched a couple games here and there.
[17:44.70]So, I'm supposed to be angry at you according to the laws of thermodynamics.
[17:49.02]I mean, that's... That's okay.
[17:53.07]There's no, being a Yankee fan, I mean, that's, I mean, you obviously, there's just something wrong with you, but.
[18:00.39]Right, of course there is.
[18:01.33]I mean, I, like, if you go to the doctor and you tell the doctor, the doctor, first of all, when they do a physical exam, one of the first things they have to ask you is, oh, come on in here.
[18:09.73]So, still a baseball fan?
[18:12.05]Yeah, yeah, I am.
[18:13.35]Yankees, Red Sox, which one?
[18:15.50]Because it's very important.
[18:16.50]You're like, Yankees.
[18:17.48]Oh, okay.
[18:17.74]So, you get a CT scan for that.
[18:21.36]They check your whole body to make sure there's not an ulcer or something.
[18:25.36]That could be what's causing it.
[18:27.89]Yeah, it's the lumbago again though.
[18:29.79]Pretty sure.
[18:31.90]It's gotta be that.
[18:32.84]What is lumbago?
[18:34.50]So the uncle character in this game says that he has a killer case of lumbago and apparently what that is is it's just his lower back hurts.
[18:42.08]So it's his lower back pain.
[18:44.92]I like to blame a lot of my failings on lumbago these days.
[18:48.51]Am I in your game?
[18:52.17]I might even just be in your game.
[18:55.39]Am I in here?
[18:56.95]I don't know.
[18:57.66]I'm sending you another invite.
[18:59.98]Doesn't look like you're in here.
[19:01.88]Oh god, this guy's gonna kill me.
[19:02.88]Hopefully I can portal out of here.
[19:06.08]Oh god.
[19:06.56]Lethal hog.
[19:07.82]Processing invite.
[19:09.70]Okay, thank god.
[19:11.46]This guy and his whole posse were menacingly walking around me with their guns out.
[19:15.99]And then I just portal-tued out of the way.
[19:21.03]Were they ghosts?
[19:22.87]No, they were just bandits.
[19:25.67]Okay, because I think that might be a glimpse at the DLC.
[19:29.39]Ghost cowboys.
[19:30.33]We had zombies in the previous game.
[19:31.83]It'll just be ghosts this time around.
[19:33.82]I wonder what their plan is.
[19:35.34]Do they have no plan at all?
[19:37.96]I think... Yeah, they have a plan.
[19:41.18]The plan is to continue implementing weapons and cosmetic items and selling gold bars that you can then buy them with.
[19:49.56]Did you know that one of the dudes at Rockstar or was it Take-Two or something said that they didn't feel GTA Online was monetized enough?
[19:57.29]Wait, is that for real?
[19:58.79]Yeah, apparently.
[19:59.57]Somebody actually said that?
[20:01.67]Yeah.
[20:04.89]And I like Rockstar.
[20:06.15]And they're really good to me.
[20:07.34]And I think that that's ridiculous.
[20:09.02]That was a highly monetized game.
[20:11.18]What the f- I think I'm in your game.
[20:14.90]But I don't think I'm very posse.
[20:16.42]Is this you up here?
[20:17.54]Hold on.
[20:17.90]I don't know.
[20:18.50]Let me just like make sure.
[20:19.54]Straub said that.
[20:22.72]Straub said that.
[20:23.46]There you go.
[20:24.70]Yeah.
[20:26.00]Yeah.
[20:26.18]I'm right next to you.
[20:27.08]Telling that there's a character that is a loan shark in this game called Straub.
[20:36.43]Just want to make sure he was dead.
[20:37.41]Hey.
[20:39.13]Thank you.
[20:40.25]Thank you.
[20:40.63]You scared the fuck out of me.
[20:43.71]Wasn't there an Activision executive that said they wish they could sell a controller that was like $150?
[20:49.41]If they could sell their games for double, they would do it if they could get away with it or something?
[20:55.58]I think so.
[20:56.18]Yeah, I seem to remember.
[20:57.26]I don't know for sure, but that sounds familiar.
[20:59.64]That was a couple years ago, no?
[21:01.04]Yeah.
[21:02.14]Something ridiculous like that.
[21:05.21]It's a gift that keeps on giving.
[21:06.81]It really is.
[21:07.33]Alright.
[21:10.18]I'm trying to join your posse.
[21:12.60]I got you the invite now.
[21:16.24]There's someone mad at me, so if someone appears over the ridge and tries to shoot us... Then strike first.
[21:22.87]Yeah.
[21:23.63]Alright, so where's this free horse?
[21:25.65]Is that your horse?
[21:26.81]Uh, yeah, it is.
[21:28.28]I guess it is now.
[21:29.08]I guess it is yours now.
[21:30.80]Uh, yeah, so, uh, Valentine.
[21:33.26]I'll set a waypoint.
[21:34.08]Set a waypoint for us.
[21:35.36]And by the way, uh, there is... Wait, wait, wait.
[21:38.34]Valentine chat?
[21:42.92]Oh, wait.
[21:44.33]Okay.
[21:45.03]There's like a 90 to 95% chance that I'm going to dump us.
[21:48.05]That's fine.
[21:48.57]What was that?
[21:49.59]Is that the guy that was trying to fight you?
[21:52.35]That's my horse.
[21:54.83]Why was it just angry?
[21:55.82]It just had like a blip on the screen.
[21:58.28]Really?
[21:58.58]Yeah, it was a red blip.
[22:00.32]No, I don't know.
[22:01.06]That was weird.
[22:03.60]Hey, easy, easy, easy, easy!
[22:06.02]Your watchers are gonna go bowl him!
[22:11.18]They're fast though.
[22:12.06]These horses are real fucking shitty.
[22:13.86]These pins!
[22:17.33]So, Jeremy, are you going to PAX East this year, even though you now live halfway across the country?
[22:22.31]More than halfway.
[22:23.67]I am not.
[22:25.21]I am not going to PAX East this year.
[22:27.93]Unfortunately.
[22:28.55]I had to check.
[22:29.73]I just wanted to know.
[22:30.69]Are you chasing after this guy?
[22:32.55]No, I'm just trying to head to, uh, Valentine.
[22:35.56]Yeah, not this year.
[22:39.54]Vinny, are you going to PAX East?
[22:41.42]I will be there in body, but not in spirit.
[22:45.12]So... So, no.
[22:49.00]Because your spirit is what controls the body.
[22:51.16]The body is just a... The body is just a big case.
[22:54.93]Yeah, it's like a meat machine.
[22:57.41]Yeah, so you're sending your, like, Corsair Cooler Master to Fax.
[23:02.87]That's correct.
[23:05.13]I need a new keyboard for this fucking thing.
[23:08.41]And I need some more memory because, man, I am running out.
[23:12.06]God, I gotta learn how to laugh without being a disgusting human being.
[23:16.11]And you're just laughing right there, just- I- I- I- What was my horse doing?
[23:19.35]What are you- Hey!
[23:20.35]What the fu- He just ran over my head.
[23:30.36]That was good.
[23:31.58]That was good, keep it up.
[23:33.58]Oh, I need to feed him.
[23:34.50]Oh!
[23:34.64]Oh, it's carrots.
[23:37.01]Where's the horse food?
[23:38.23]Oh, that's right.
[23:38.87]I can feed him my clothes?
[23:40.15]Oh, no.
[23:41.18]I barely have anything to feed this fucking thing.
[23:52.42]Are you trying to shoot that guy?
[23:54.40]Yeah, I tried.
[23:56.14]But, yeah, what I'm saying is... People must hate talking to me.
[24:00.74]Okay, so let me ask you something.
[24:01.86]When we, like, hung out... We hung out in person.
[24:05.96]In person.
[24:07.78]When I, like, laughed at something, did I just, like, sprinkle or spit in your face?
[24:12.43]No!
[24:12.95]Okay, I don't know what it is about sitting here, but every time I laugh, I just, like... Droplets of water are just all over my screen.
[24:18.41]I'm not even sipping anything.
[24:19.39]I don't understand how.
[24:21.55]You know, I have a weird confession to make.
[24:24.35]Okay.
[24:25.18]So my Wii U gamepad, the screen, is like, is kind of gross.
[24:30.90]That's like four years of streaming it and speaking in front of it.
[24:34.60]And I thought I didn't spit when I spoke or laugh.
[24:37.80]I was clearly extremely mistaken.
[24:40.16]So I think this is just being a human.
[24:41.74]This is just faulty hardware.
[24:43.68]Something that we all share.
[24:45.38]No, I think you're onto something there because it's gonna happen again.
[24:48.40]Don't you do it.
[24:48.88]Okay, we're fine.
[24:50.84]This horse sucks.
[24:52.30]I'd rather just ride on yours.
[24:55.42]You can if you want.
[24:57.22]My oatmeal is a sturdy horse.
[24:59.94]But also the frame rates are dipping.
[25:02.24]Are you getting weird frame rates?
[25:04.14]It's bad.
[25:05.12]It's like 20 frames a second.
[25:07.07]Yeah, what's going on?
[25:07.77]I feel like I'm playing Ocarina of Time again.
[25:09.21]Let me transfer.
[25:11.23]I think that's just a... Ooh, almost a tree.
[25:20.42]Just hang on a minute, okay?
[25:21.62]Yeah.
[25:21.98]Where's your horse?
[25:22.68]I'll take care of it.
[25:26.12]Wait, you're killing him.
[25:27.32]You just killed my horse?
[25:28.36]No, no.
[25:29.36]It wouldn't let me.
[25:30.67]We're friends.
[25:32.39]It wouldn't let me.
[25:34.13]Yeah, I tried.
[25:36.76]But you haven't noticed that, um, I don't know, do you have, like, an iPad or anything?
[25:40.26]I don't have any, um... No.
[25:42.72]Or even, like, the Switch or the Wii U, you're right, but... For some reason, it's the most embarrassing thing in the world.
[25:49.61]Even your phone, too.
[25:50.81]If somebody ever was like, hey, can I use your phone?
[25:53.01]It's just like, oh, fuck, oh, and you look at it, and it's just like, hold on, I was, like, shitting and, like, using this, I gotta, like, wipe it off, I gotta, like, I gotta, like, I just was pissing and... There's particles!
[26:03.38]There's particles.
[26:04.06]Whether you want there to be or not, there's particles.
[26:06.40]Nobody wants you to... If there's a screen involved, you never want someone to touch it or look at it.
[26:14.50]Anytime somebody wants to... Oh, can I use your iPad for a second?
[26:18.23]Well, that person didn't let us use their iPad.
[26:20.49]Fuck!
[26:25.97]Maybe there are horses better.
[26:27.53]I can't steal it.
[26:31.47]We can't take it?
[26:32.13]Oh, hey!
[26:37.49]Calm it down, calm down, calm down, calm down.
[26:39.05]Alright, let's get out of here before they get mad at us.
[26:41.31]No, no, I'm talking about the horse.
[26:42.49]I calmed the horse down.
[26:43.21]This thing is cool.
[26:43.87]We need to take this thing.
[26:46.07]I don't think we can.
[26:46.97]I think it's got a saddle on it.
[26:49.26]That thing tried to kick you, by the way.
[26:56.94]Wow, that person's head is still bleeding.
[27:00.85]I can't wait to get our cool... Oh, there they are.
[27:02.11]There they are.
[27:02.61]Alright, line it up.
[27:06.58]I'm jumping to the horse.
[27:11.48]Not even necessary.
[27:13.74]No, none of this is necessary.
[27:15.18]I told you, I'm not a good guy.
[27:17.14]I am morally as gray as you can get.
[27:19.40]This is your... This is good guy, right?
[27:22.94]I'm a good guy, yeah.
[27:23.92]No, that's what... Good.
[27:25.64]We... What's bad, then?
[27:28.93]They are bad.
[27:29.59]We're killing the bad guys.
[27:30.63]That's what I'm saying.
[27:31.27]Mm-hmm.
[27:34.79]So, oh, oh, oh.
[27:35.69]Here, in regards to the discussion that we just had about touchscreens, did you know that they did... I don't know who they is.
[27:42.85]They.
[27:43.17]But they did some tests on McDonald's touchscreens for ordering, and they determined that there is poo on every one of the ones that they tested.
[27:52.95]Oh, that's, uh... That's fucking disgusting.
[27:57.74]Nice jump, by the way.
[27:59.64]Yeah.
[28:02.55]I'm sorry, man, but I'm of the opinion.
[28:04.15]That doesn't really gross me out because I feel like there's poo everywhere.
[28:07.97]Yeah, there is poo everywhere.
[28:09.23]As Bruce Willis once said, there's always a little shit in the meat.
[28:12.30]I mean, like, there's probably shit on your hands right now.
[28:16.39]Yeah.
[28:16.95]No, I wouldn't be surprised.
[28:17.83]I mean, you know, little microbes.
[28:19.95]I mean, if you test the oxygen around you, it's probably like 0.1% poo.
[28:25.15]And you just looked down and it was like, oh my god!
[28:27.21]My hands are covered in shit!
[28:30.41]I looked down and my controller is just filled with turds.
[28:35.27]That would be disgusting.
[28:37.15]I'm getting... Someone just said, Vinny, I'm getting sick.
[28:39.49]I'm sorry, chat member.
[28:40.45]You didn't deserve that.
[28:42.83]How much vomit particulates do you believe are floating around at any given moment?
[28:47.57]Well, I'll be completely honest, at least a few dozen here, because when you said you were a Yankees fan, I threw up into my glass, so... Oh, good point.
[28:54.90]That did happen.
[28:56.92]How did you feel about... I mean, are you... I don't remember if we talked about this when we were in Boston, but are you a big enough baseball fan to have really felt like a dopamine hit when they won?
[29:06.98]Um, no.
[29:08.68]Because I took the ultimate drug in 2004.
[29:12.69]Jesus?
[29:15.71]Yeah, I found Jesus.
[29:18.01]Oh, no, really?
[29:18.49]What did you hit?
[29:20.82]When the Red Sox won the World Series for the first time in like 100 years.
[29:23.86]Oh, okay.
[29:25.08]That was the good one.
[29:26.10]2004 was like the magical year and no other drug could ever come close.
[29:31.06]2007 was pretty good, too, because one of my favorite players was on the World Series in 2007, and, you know, that team, I think, was a really great team.
[29:40.44]But then, 2013, it was like, oh, okay, man, this is, this, Red Sox are so good, this third time in, like, less than 10 years.
[29:49.37]And then this last one, it's like the best team they've ever had in history, of the history of the entire franchise, and it's like, yeah!
[29:55.45]Man, I wish I could get that 2004 drug bill.
[29:58.90]Right, right.
[29:59.55]It just gets less.
[30:00.75]It's like when the Yankees won a bunch in a row in the late 90s, and it was just getting boring.
[30:07.21]And then when they didn't win, it was like, well, fuck, I wanted a day off from school.
[30:11.17]It wasn't even special anymore.
[30:12.63]It was just, where's my day off?
[30:13.67]Because they were giving us a day off when the Yankees won.
[30:16.54]Really?
[30:17.66]Yeah, they did for the parade.
[30:19.46]You could choose not to go, and they wouldn't be upset.
[30:22.32]Wow.
[30:24.22]So where's our free horse?
[30:26.70]Hey, chat.
[30:28.77]Was that a Jape?
[30:30.99]Did you guys... We were just joking with us the whole time, huh?
[30:35.57]No.
[30:36.62]The free horse is in Strawberry.
[30:39.94]Jeremy, I have a... I have a confession.
[30:42.42]What is it?
[30:43.48]I took us to the wrong town.
[30:45.20]Oh.
[30:45.30]It's okay.
[30:47.78]Because I go to the wrong town literally every time I play the game.
[30:51.28]So... Okay.
[30:53.78]We have to go to Strawberry.
[30:54.78]Wait, wait.
[30:55.06]Can we take a...
[30:57.67]I can take a fast travel.
[30:58.63]I think it costs money.
[30:59.31]What's this horse?
[31:01.38]Did I get a... Oh, this is the horse that I got from... Okay, yeah.
[31:04.74]So this is my actual horse.
[31:07.70]What's wrong with the frame rates in multiplayer?
[31:09.50]Jesus.
[31:09.90]Yeah, they're pretty bad.
[31:14.39]I'm gonna attempt to do the stagecoach and see how long that takes.
[31:17.97]And how much money it costs to fast travel over there.
[31:20.29]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[31:21.03]That's probably a good idea.
[31:23.28]It's under by horses superior, but it's only in strawberry.
[31:27.08]Only in strawberry.
[31:30.60]How far away is that from here?
[31:31.40]That's not that far.
[31:32.39]It's not too bad.
[31:33.35]It's not terrible.
[31:34.41]Vinny, no.
[31:34.97]Hang on.
[31:35.57]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[31:36.75]Only strawberry.
[31:37.91]No.
[31:38.41]In any stables.
[31:39.27]Only strawberry.
[31:40.75]Any stable.
[31:41.43]Only strawberry.
[31:42.21]I hate life sometimes.
[31:43.58]Okay.
[31:43.82]I'm going to go back to this, and I'm going to let you know.
[31:46.14]Eat the raspberries, Vinny.
[31:47.68]That's what they say.
[31:49.70]Eat those raspberries.
[31:50.86]Don't eat them.
[31:52.30]They're not poisonous.
[31:53.14]Those raspberries in front of you are not poisonous.
[31:54.76]Yes, they are.
[31:55.40]They're poisonous.
[31:56.90]Like, I've talked about this on my stream before, but let me see how you feel about this.
[32:00.95]Go ahead.
[32:02.07]If you were in a room, and there were a hundred people outside, like we're talking like a two-way mirror, like glass, right?
[32:08.65]You're sitting in like an interrogation room.
[32:12.10]And a guy comes in and puts berries down in front of you.
[32:17.84]They're like red.
[32:18.46]Just red berries on the little plate and he leaves the room.
[32:22.20]Are you going to eat them if you hear 50% of the people screaming, don't eat those, they're poisonous, from the other room?
[32:29.05]Or, eat them, they'll give you superpowers, don't listen to them.
[32:31.61]What are you going to do?
[32:35.49]Are you going to eat them?
[32:36.07]How depressed am I before I enter this room?
[32:38.77]Today was a great day.
[32:40.90]Like, today was a fantastic day.
[32:43.24]One of the best you probably had all week.
[32:46.67]Did Smash come out yet?
[32:49.87]Yeah, Smash came out, and Angino got confirmed for DLC.
[33:00.82]Okay, I won't eat the berries then.
[33:02.16]You won't eat them?
[33:03.12]Alright, no.
[33:03.90]Alright, so when you push that away, half of the people in the other room are screaming at you, and they're very upset with you.
[33:11.10]And like your day gets worse because as you're walking out there's like drinks are getting thrown at you.
[33:16.52]There's like fruits that are flying by your head.
[33:18.18]Like you should have eaten those you fucking idiot.
[33:19.92]And like somebody drives by and throws like a large soda at you.
[33:22.14]I wouldn't even.
[33:26.22]No, I don't think so.
[33:34.20]I mean, superpowers sound cool and everything, but isn't God much more cooler?
[33:39.50]God.
[33:39.88]Alright, I'm gonna sell oatmeal.
[33:41.10]Goodbye, oatmeal.
[33:41.94]You fucking suck.
[33:42.92]Why are you selling your horse?
[33:44.80]I liked oatmeal because it was a cool name, but someone else can have oatmeal.
[33:47.88]There's a free horse in here, dude.
[33:49.07]There's a free horse in there?
[33:49.85]Yeah, there's a free horse.
[33:54.23]Did you just, like, ram into the fucking stables at full speed?
[33:57.23]Yeah.
[33:58.05]Because I saw that on the cutscene.
[34:01.00]Alright, go to buy horse, and then go to superior at the bottom, Arabian, red chestnut.
[34:08.52]And you can claim a free horse.
[34:10.18]Your stable is full.
[34:12.02]Yeah, you gotta sell your other horse.
[34:13.92]Okay, how much did you get for selling that one?
[34:16.18]Uh, like, next to nothing.
[34:17.98]Oh.
[34:19.22]My horse's name is Sean.
[34:20.96]Alright, sorry.
[34:23.25]Woah!
[34:25.43]Wait, what?
[34:25.99]Someone said name it Bagel.
[34:28.86]Name it Nut.
[34:30.82]Oh, that's a good idea.
[34:31.46]I'll name it Nut.
[34:32.04]People are going to be so upset that I'm about to sell this horse.
[34:35.86]Nut.
[34:36.40]Yeah, my audience was not happy.
[34:39.76]Oh, by the way, why don't we do a quick plug?
[34:41.95]I want to plug your stream.
[34:43.13]If anyone wants to see what's going on or do like a multi-stream and watch Jerma stream too.
[34:47.07]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[34:48.23]You can go to twitch.tv/Jerma.
[34:54.05]That's good enough.
[34:55.36]That's good enough.
[34:55.86]They'll find me.
[34:56.54]Sure.
[34:57.44]twitch.tv/Jerma.
[34:59.86]Yeah, it's J-H-E-R-R-H-H-H.
[35:03.70]twitch.tv slash... No, because there's numbers, right?
[35:06.08]At the end?
[35:07.00]Yeah, I'm one of those idiots that has numbers.
[35:10.60]Jerma985, J-E-R-M-A-985.
[35:12.08]Anybody over here that wants to go check out Vinny?
[35:16.54]Yeah, you could go to twitch.tv slash... Yeah, there's like four H's.
[35:23.01]Yeah.
[35:25.77]Yeah, Vinesauce.
[35:29.05]That is correct.
[35:31.72]Multistream us.
[35:32.46]You know what I'm saying?
[35:34.10]Yeah.
[35:34.34]There's gonna be a way to do that natively soon enough.
[35:37.22]Like Twitch has implemented or they're working on implementing a way to do that.
[35:42.06]So that way you can just enjoy other streamers without having to go to like a multistream website.
[35:48.22]So that's kind of cool.
[35:50.18]Yeah.
[35:50.76]That's kind of... That's very necessary.
[35:54.14]Yeah.
[35:54.70]I think it's a great idea.
[35:56.76]Surprised it hasn't happened sooner.
[36:00.26]There we go.
[36:00.76]Alright, so I got my free horse.
[36:02.12]Thank God.
[36:04.58]There's a couple free saddles available.
[36:07.48]Yeah.
[36:08.24]I'm looking at some of the stuff right now.
[36:10.66]80 bucks.
[36:11.72]How are you ever gonna get, like, more than five gold bars in this game?
[36:16.01]How is that impossible?
[36:16.89]Oh, I know how it's possible.
[36:19.43]Oh, you do?
[36:21.81]There was a big drama post about how someone was like, they did the math, and to earn enough money to buy another stable, or like, you know, a horse, a good horse, they said it was something like 80 hours, and then that was disproven.
[36:35.01]I mean, they got the math wrong, and it was like seven hours instead.
[36:38.05]Oh.
[36:39.29]I don't want to cause you any alarm here, but horse insurance for this horse is five gold bars that I don't have.
[36:47.98]found out that the horses come back no matter what the insurance just makes them more healthy oh okay so you can't if you have an owned horse and multiplayer you're good okay that's good um but yeah you definitely um want to get another saddle because there's some really good ones uh so what you do is go to empty slot attack one of them and then special oh you got it yeah I got one okay cool
[37:18.86]I don't know why these are free.
[37:21.02]Are these all for free?
[37:22.10]I mean, I can't buy them, though.
[37:25.10]Some of them.
[37:25.72]Oh, some of them are.
[37:26.50]Did you get the couple free ones?
[37:29.26]This one's 39.
[37:31.09]Which one is the free one?
[37:31.89]This one's 67.
[37:33.61]It should just be 00.
[37:36.67]Oh, I've done it special.
[37:37.53]Okay, I see.
[37:38.83]Alligator Ranch.
[37:39.83]Yeah, we'll get this one.
[37:42.29]The very last one at the end is really good.
[37:45.34]Let's see.
[37:48.68]rattlesnake oh uh quick recommendation while we're here I'd recommend getting some provisions for your horse so they can eat and not die oh that's a good idea yeah and maybe a horse reviver too it's a little expensive but it's probably worth it yeah so it's services right well not services under
[38:14.42]provisions how much is it yeah that's a lot um well the horse survivor is a lot of money but the hay is a quarter so that's not too bad and it's I'm just gonna buy a shitload of it hey what about a sugar cube you're gonna get a couple of those I'm gonna get some beets from shroot farms but uh yeah I'm gonna get some sugar cube I got a horse survivor I got some food alright you know by doing this we're never gonna afford new weapons never
[38:40.01]I've come to, uh... I've come to terms with the fact that it's just gonna be... I'm gonna use, like, the pea shooter.
[38:45.62]And, like, the BB gun.
[38:47.14]Yeah.
[38:47.86]Me too.
[38:50.68]Should we get our horses?
[38:51.82]Sorry, I had some peanut butter.
[38:54.11]Like a horse would.
[38:55.93]That's what they used to feed Mr. Ed to make it look like he was talking.
[39:01.18]The way you said that, too, like the way your voice managed to squeak out that sentence, it sounded like Mr. Ed a little bit.
[39:11.01]So, good job.
[39:12.45]I didn't even... That show sucks.
[39:16.01]Yeah, I hated Mr. Ed.
[39:18.71]That horse scared the fuck out of me.
[39:20.03]It's like, why does it talk?
[39:21.73]I don't like it.
[39:24.15]Yeah, and why didn't anybody try to breed it?
[39:28.48]You could have a bunch of... You could start an entire new horse... Subspecies.
[39:34.00]Yeah, we could have intelligent horses.
[39:37.47]All talking.
[39:38.23]Sell them.
[39:39.53]They would be so happy.
[39:41.51]Horses that just love to sit around and eat hay, right?
[39:44.11]Yeah, that's all they do.
[39:45.63]Just put a headset on.
[39:46.69]Yeah, put a headset on them.
[39:48.92]They could be like telemarketers while they're just hanging out.
[39:53.16]Where are we going?
[39:54.30]That's right, you give them jobs again.
[39:55.88]Like, because they don't have as many jobs these days like they used to back in the old west and, you know, before that, of course.
[40:01.47]But I think, yeah, make them telemarketers.
[40:03.19]Hello.
[40:04.15]How can I help you?
[40:05.93]They would be so happy.
[40:06.95]They would get paid.
[40:08.87]They would get paid.
[40:09.85]Of course we would pay them.
[40:12.36]Of course.
[40:12.76]Fucking horse cars.
[40:13.80]Of course, of course, of course.
[40:16.02]Where are we going?
[40:17.40]I don't know.
[40:17.86]Do you want to kill some things?
[40:19.92]Yeah, let's go.
[40:22.76]In the context of this video game, yes.
[40:25.52]It's out of context.
[40:26.80]Hey, you want to go kill some stuff?
[40:27.97]Yeah!
[40:29.07]Yeah, we don't want to do that.
[40:31.53]Well, okay.
[40:32.05]Here's what we could do.
[40:32.75]I want to go run over some rabbits.
[40:38.33]I can start up a quick join and we can do a mission.
[40:42.35]We can do a story mission or we can do like a showdown mission.
[40:46.45]Yeah, let's just do like a... Let's do a showdown mission.
[40:49.29]Why not?
[40:49.99]Okay.
[40:53.86]Showdown series.
[40:54.50]You'll also join as a member of their posse.
[40:55.98]Okay, cool.
[40:59.58]It looks like we're going.
[41:02.76]Alright, cool.
[41:11.59]So how's the weather over there, man?
[41:13.11]It's beautiful.
[41:13.61]Do you miss Boston weather?
[41:16.59]Not at all.
[41:18.30]Because this is snow season here for Boston.
[41:22.26]So I am absolutely ecstatic that it's like 50 degrees every day.
[41:28.31]It drops down overnight because it's obviously the desert.
[41:30.41]So it drops down to like low 40s.
[41:34.05]So it gets cold, but the days are great.
[41:39.34]He's literally talking about the weather.
[41:42.82]Oh, God, I just got booted.
[41:44.93]Wait, you got booted?
[41:46.93]Really?
[41:47.19]Yeah.
[41:48.89]Oh, okay.
[41:50.23]Why does this game hate me so much?
[41:52.99]I'll just quit out.
[41:56.07]I don't know why this game hates me so much.
[41:57.83]Yeah, what's wrong with the weather?
[42:03.66]I'll just say this.
[42:04.28]Lately, it's been pretty cold here, but...
[42:08.64]Considered, at times in my life, moving to a place where I don't have to deal with, like, bone chill.
[42:17.31]Yeah, it's... The one thing that I will say is going to the West Coast is... I mean, there are pros and cons everywhere.
[42:25.70]I mean, I miss Boston all the time.
[42:27.94]Yeah, but you miss bagels.
[42:30.14]Yeah, you bet your ass I do.
[42:34.34]I miss the bagels, I miss the sub sandwiches, like the steak and cheese subs.
[42:38.18]Oof, I miss those.
[42:40.22]Yeah.
[42:41.68]I would miss those too, I'd miss the pizza.
[42:44.78]Ah, that's right.
[42:45.88]Did you find any good pizza?
[42:47.82]Yeah, I mean, there's some decent pizza places out here, but not like there are in New York, obviously.
[42:51.97]Okay, I'm gonna try to invite you again.
[42:57.64]yeah I don't I don't know why because every time it kicks me out it says there's a problem with the rockstar servers it doesn't like say you've been disconnected because your computer sucks it's you've been disconnected our servers are a problem that's like what the error is I mean at least they're honest about it I don't know though I feel like I don't know who this is who the fuck is this
[43:26.62]I think I just... Alright.
[43:31.33]Alright, I'm ready for an invite.
[43:36.21]There it is.
[43:37.32]Hey, coming to you.
[43:39.04]Hey!
[43:48.87]I've been watching The Office like a dumbass lately.
[43:51.24]I don't know why.
[43:51.72]It's a good show.
[43:52.30]Like a dumbass?
[43:53.16]There's an episode.
[43:53.88]Yeah, it's a good show.
[43:55.02]I don't know.
[43:55.30]It's just it was something to watch.
[43:56.48]And there's an episode where in the beginning, the cold open.
[44:00.62]We talked about the weather.
[44:01.48]Now I'm describing episodes of The Office.
[44:04.38]Your audience is going to be like, can you stop streaming with this guy?
[44:07.16]Yeah, this guy sucks.
[44:09.28]He can't even stay connected to Rockstar's video game servers, and he's talking about the weather?
[44:16.91]Anyway, there's an episode where they go A, and I'm going to stop there.
[44:20.77]It's good enough.
[44:22.07]There's an episode where they go A. Yeah, they go A. Here, I'll invite you again.
[44:28.08]I mean, if we have another problem at this point, I'll just like watch you stream.
[44:33.26]No, I mean, I'm down to try a couple more matches at least.
[44:37.20]It's worth a shot.
[44:38.20]Yeah.
[44:38.87]I think we could have some fun if it just was stable.
[44:41.11]I know.
[44:41.61]I know.
[44:41.97]I don't understand.
[44:43.85]I've gotten disconnected like three or four times when I stream this too, but... It happens.
[44:48.17]Usually from random matches.
[44:50.91]I don't understand.
[44:52.92]What's the weather like on The Office?
[44:55.85]What's the weather like on The Office?
[45:00.21]Well, I can answer that because it was filmed in California and they try to make it look like Scranton, Pennsylvania, so it's snowy, but it's really not.
[45:17.48]Well, I got booted again.
[45:21.55]Super cool.
[45:22.93]I'm gonna try to, like, restart the game.
[45:24.02]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[45:24.70]But you're, you're still, like, you haven't had any problems streaming.
[45:27.32]Oh, no, not at all.
[45:28.20]I've, I've got no drop frames at all.
[45:31.36]It's, uh, it's something, it's something to do with where I'm coming from.
[45:35.80]Why does Rockstar not want to acknowledge Las Vegas?
[45:38.50]I, maybe they don't.
[45:39.53]I don't understand.
[45:40.11]I wasn't, oh, no, I'm not deleting the game.
[45:44.98]Uh, yeah, I don't know.
[45:47.14]It's something to do with how they connect.
[45:49.44]I figured it was a problem from three days ago, because it was the first day or two of the beta, but it looks like it's kind of just a server routing or server problem with Rockstar.
[45:59.44]And specifically, either Las Vegas servers or California servers, because, I mean, technically I'm on the West Coast, so...
[46:09.74]Well, maybe they'll get that sorted out in a couple days.
[46:11.62]Yeah.
[46:12.40]That's what I was hoping for.
[46:13.28]That's what I was hoping for three days ago.
[46:15.22]But... Yeah.
[46:16.46]Sorry.
[46:16.94]Sorry this is kind of impeding on everything.
[46:19.80]That's fine.
[46:20.56]I mean I'm still shooting people in the face.
[46:22.12]It's not a big deal.
[46:23.15]But I would prefer to shoot people in the face with you in an actual match.
[46:26.55]That would be better.
[46:29.03]I'll invite you again.
[46:30.67]Try again.
[46:31.09]Yeah.
[46:31.23]Let's try again.
[46:33.73]Even though it says I'm on a mission.
[46:37.75]Maybe they just hate you.
[46:39.53]I don't know, maybe.
[46:42.93]I tried restarting it.
[46:48.13]Moving to the country, gonna eat myself some peaches.
[46:52.94]Moving to the country, gonna eat me a lot of peaches.
[46:55.92]Gonna eat a lot of peaches.
[46:58.14]Look out!
[47:00.64]Look out, man.
[47:03.51]Peaches come in a can.
[47:05.65]They was put there by a man.
[47:10.78]I haven't heard that in a long time.
[47:12.30]Holy shit.
[47:14.24]Yeah, that was for you.
[47:15.16]I figured you might know about that one.
[47:17.02]That was great.
[47:19.78]Yeah.
[47:20.20]I feel really good right now.
[47:22.24]I was a little sad about the Rockstar server issue here, but I feel fantastic.
[47:26.48]You feel alright now?
[47:28.04]Yeah, it just takes the power of song.
[47:30.08]That's all it takes.
[47:32.18]Alright, here we go.
[47:34.00]Don't do it, Rockstar.
[47:35.97]I know you want to.
[47:37.79]Look at him.
[47:38.31]Look at him do it.
[47:39.23]Look at how much they want.
[47:40.53]Oh no, that's a- okay.
[47:42.09]I'm ready.
[47:43.71]For an invite.
[47:44.77]And this will be the last time because it's gonna stay on.
[47:47.23]And I'm not gonna get disconnected from Rockstar's servers.
[47:50.58]The problem is I can't actually invite you now because I'm in a mission.
[47:53.80]Supposedly.
[47:54.56]Maybe for the better so then I can stay connected for a minute.
[48:02.80]That's what you think.
[48:03.54]I know.
[48:03.78]Let me try... So explain to me what you were just doing.
[48:11.00]Because you were doing like a randomized Ocarina of Time.
[48:15.97]Yeah.
[48:17.63]So there's a randomizer.
[48:18.93]And you can assign a bunch of different options.
[48:20.71]It's a really customizable randomizer.
[48:23.71]And all you have to do is... Every trust...
[48:28.51]Wow, I did what you did earlier.
[48:30.58]Every treasure chest... Every treasure chest.
[48:34.08]Oh, Jesus.
[48:34.62]Good luck saying it the right way ever again.
[48:38.10]Every treasure chest has randomized content, except for a couple.
[48:41.99]And you can find medallions, you can find items, you can find swords, you can find all kinds of crazy shit.
[48:47.11]Really?
[48:47.81]And essentially, you have to get the six medallions, and they could be anywhere, and then you can fight Ganon.
[48:53.48]And you can...
[48:55.41]make it really hard for yourself, or you can make it a lot easier for yourself.
[48:58.85]Like, for example, I started the game Kakariko Village was open.
[49:03.44]I started the game where Kokiri Forest was open, so I could just leave and go to the world map anytime.
[49:08.14]Oh, really?
[49:09.60]So, but yeah, I mean, it's kind of cool because you could just play the game in like six or seven hours if you're lucky and you know what you're doing.
[49:16.80]So could you get everything in the first six chests of the game?
[49:20.76]I got a hookshot in the first chest.
[49:23.20]Wow.
[49:24.38]That's cool.
[49:25.14]And you can get some... I got a medallion real early.
[49:27.83]You can get really broken like stuff early on.
[49:31.07]Or you can get 5 blue rupees.
[49:33.19]5 rupees every time.
[49:34.69]Which is the worst thing ever.
[49:37.45]Yeah.
[49:37.91]That's like... What is it?
[49:39.36]Green rupee the lowest?
[49:40.26]Mm-hmm.
[49:44.04]But it's a really fun thing.
[49:45.88]I love it.
[49:46.44]I'm really enjoying it.
[49:47.58]No.
[49:47.66]It seemed cool.
[49:49.94]It seemed really cool from what I saw.
[49:53.26]You've never done a randomizer stream?
[49:55.16]Uh, never.
[49:55.86]I mean, the only randomizer I've ever heard of or ever done was something like Team Fortress.
[50:04.60]And that just randomizes loadouts, not like randomizing the whole game, essentially.
[50:08.01]Oh, I see.
[50:08.67]I gotcha.
[50:11.01]So I'm just running until my character dies.
[50:15.85]Is that possible?
[50:17.13]You need to feed the character eventually.
[50:20.11]Hey chat, does anyone know how to abandon this stupid mail bag quest?
[50:24.48]Oh yeah, I got stuck in the mail room by the way.
[50:27.60]You gotta be careful with that mail door.
[50:36.92]Shoot yourself in the head.
[50:38.06]Okay, now the timer ran out.
[50:39.76]Okay, so now I can probably invite you.
[50:45.68]Yes, the mail door.
[50:48.36]The door to the mail room.
[50:49.54]The mail door.
[50:50.78]I got trapped in there, remember?
[50:52.06]And I was breaking windows.
[50:55.38]Did someone not understand?
[50:56.44]They were like, what are you talking about, Jerma?
[50:57.98]They were saying, like, M-A-L-E.
[50:59.90]Like, mail door.
[51:01.86]Oh.
[51:02.78]Okay.
[51:12.91]Oh, fuck!
[51:14.21]You alright?
[51:14.67]You okay?
[51:14.93]Yeah, I'm alright.
[51:16.41]What happened?
[51:18.08]Tell me in minute detail.
[51:19.46]Good shot in the head.
[51:22.95]Hey, can you invite me?
[51:23.79]Let me see.
[51:25.73]Because my invite thing is totally blocked out for some reason.
[51:28.99]Mine is too.
[51:31.99]View invites and updates.
[51:36.72]Can I?
[51:37.56]No.
[51:40.06]Yeah, I can't invite you either.
[51:41.42]It's blocked out.
[51:45.08]Um, Rockstar, what the heck are you doing here?
[51:47.72]Guess I'll just die.
[51:54.97]Are we in the same game?
[51:58.71]I'm playing Red Dead Redemption 3.
[52:01.32]Well, because if we're in the same lobby, I don't think so.
[52:06.66]No, because I can't.
[52:07.96]No, I don't think so either.
[52:08.90]Because I can't even get you into my posse.
[52:13.66]R1 on the player list.
[52:17.74]Apparently, you're not even online.
[52:23.66]What?
[52:24.49]Yeah, apparently, if you go to your, like, friends tab, so go to players and then hit R1.
[52:29.13]And does it say I'm, like, online?
[52:30.45]Let me check.
[52:39.66]I'm just eating baked beans.
[52:45.23]You know what's a cool thing to do as a streamer, I found out, I've learned over the years?
[52:48.48]What's that?
[52:48.92]Is to eat food while you're streaming.
[52:53.25]I can't do that, man.
[52:55.25]It's either the best thing for some people and they love it,
[52:59.49]Or it's like they'll watch a stream specifically because it's social eating.
[53:03.78]Mm-hmm.
[53:04.24]Yeah, I've heard of that.
[53:04.86]Or they hate the way it sounds, yeah.
[53:07.04]I've heard of like the social eating thing, but not just like, oh, hey guys, just gonna take a break from Red Dead and eat a plate of spaghetti.
[53:12.68]Hold on.
[53:13.92]I could.
[53:14.32]I could do it.
[53:14.69]I don't want people looking at me when I'm eating.
[53:17.12]Yeah.
[53:18.10]Don't fucking look at me, is what I say.
[53:20.06]I don't.
[53:20.42]Like, when I go to dinner, out with friends or family, and the food comes out, I hate the fact that everyone's just able to look at me.
[53:28.50]Just across the table.
[53:30.01]Fuck what?
[53:31.07]You know what?
[53:31.41]Let's go off on this.
[53:32.55]Fuck the whole table scenario that we have here in the United States.
[53:36.21]Somebody sitting across from you, they're always looking at you, and they're staring at your eyes.
[53:39.35]Like, you do the weird eye contact when you both take a huge bite, and you're like, oh, whoops.
[53:43.01]No, just line us up on the other side so it's just a giant bench.
[53:48.11]And no one's across from you.
[53:49.81]Everyone just sits in this.
[53:50.78]You can fit so many more people.
[53:53.40]Like Thanksgiving, except for the fact that you don't have to sit across from anybody.
[53:56.50]That's like the Last Supper, you mean, right?
[53:59.16]You know what I do?
[53:59.68]I put a frock on a tripod.
[54:00.88]What the fuck are you doing here?
[54:01.88]How did you get in here?
[54:02.60]How did you get in here?
[54:03.22]I don't know.
[54:06.98]No, no, no.
[54:07.48]Get off me.
[54:08.19]Get off me.
[54:08.57]Get your hands in the air.
[54:13.51]How did you find me?
[54:15.91]I don't even understand how you got in here.
[54:24.37]I went into the menus and I found you and I just joined.
[54:28.99]Easy, easy.
[54:29.75]Watch the edge.
[54:30.87]Oh my god, you're choking me to death.
[54:34.57]Oh shit, I didn't mean to do that.
[54:35.81]Oh, that's a shame.
[54:41.25]No, stay right there.
[54:41.89]I want to take a picture of you.
[54:45.77]I wanna get, like, a good photo of you.
[54:48.79]Alright.
[54:53.47]By the way, I'm the camera.
[54:56.54]Okay.
[55:03.64]I lived, I somehow lived.
[55:04.72]Didn't see that one coming, Jerma.
[55:06.07]Oh, look who I've got.
[55:09.13]Hey, come on down here.
[55:10.57]Come retrieve your body.
[55:11.87]Who's this?
[55:13.07]Oh, that's me!
[55:14.29]Was that me?
[55:14.93]Uh-huh.
[55:16.01]Yeah, I threw you down there.
[55:17.37]What the fu- Hold on a minute.
[55:20.31]I know what we're gonna do today.
[55:23.62]Okay.
[55:24.94]We're gonna make a bunch of dead bodies of ourselves on this ledge.
[55:29.64]It really will be Westworld then.
[55:32.03]I just invited you to a posse though, so... Oh, did you?
[55:35.52]Yeah.
[55:36.42]Oh, I don't see any invites.
[55:38.22]I think I just kicked the muskrat in... Yeah.
[55:41.40]How come I don't have any invites from you?
[55:43.98]Because this fucking servers are so fucking broken.
[55:49.15]I'm gone.
[55:49.51]Ah...
[55:58.76]Here's a wild thing.
[56:00.10]This is worse than before.
[56:01.59]This is worse than it was three days ago.
[56:04.61]Is it really?
[56:05.03]Did you get disconnected again?
[56:06.37]Mm-hmm.
[56:08.87]Yeah, this is worse than it was three days ago.
[56:10.23]Damn.
[56:17.69]There's something wrong with what Rockstar servers on the East Coast, or West Coast specifically.
[56:23.74]Has to be.
[56:25.65]I'm sure it's something.
[56:27.23]Because I have a stable connection everywhere else.
[56:31.05]Uh... Somebody said... Okay, this is weird.
[56:38.80]I'm lagging too, because my character is doing the whistling face, but there are no whistles coming out of it.
[56:43.02]Somebody said that he doesn't... He says he doesn't eat on stream, but there was a time you shoved a bunch of taquitos into your mouth or something.
[56:59.63]The character's going meme-y.
[57:02.42]Yeah, I'm fucking... I'm all lagged out.
[57:05.74]Did you eat, like, taquitos on stream?
[57:08.06]Me?
[57:08.56]Yeah, like, somebody's saying that you... They said you don't eat on stream, but, like, you ate a shitload of taquitos when you were shitfaced or something.
[57:17.23]What?
[57:17.87]Oh, they're talking about me.
[57:20.25]Me, okay.
[57:20.81]Oh, me.
[57:27.64]And you don't remember this.
[57:28.94]No, what?
[57:30.06]Yeah, you were shit-faced.
[57:32.02]When did I eat taquitos?
[57:32.98]What the fuck are you guys talking about?
[57:38.77]I ate testiculitos.
[57:40.77]V-Dub gave me some.
[57:43.19]What?
[57:44.07]Yeah, but that's a long story.
[57:45.17]What the fuck?
[57:47.20]I have a rival as a pro Call of Duty player named Vdub, and he's got a thing called testiculitos.
[57:52.66]It's a really... Yeah, it's a long story.
[57:55.64]Testiculitos.
[57:58.16]Yeah.
[57:58.72]Okay, is your invites grayed out?
[58:02.16]Oh, yeah.
[58:02.52]Yes, it is.
[58:03.19]So, I don't know.
[58:04.01]Maybe there's just a problem again, and we picked the great perfect day three days later where it just doesn't work again.
[58:12.13]I mean, I know how I joined your game before.
[58:13.87]I went into the friends menu, I went to your profile, and then I clicked join.
[58:17.75]So I'm gonna do that again, see if that works.
[58:19.95]Yeah, I don't understand, man.
[58:21.51]I wish I knew.
[58:22.06]Oh, there's tobacco here.
[58:31.98]It's time for me to chew gum on the stream.
[58:36.73]I was wasted, and Kim brought me taquitos.
[58:41.93]That didn't happen.
[58:44.17]I've never had a taquito before in my life.
[58:52.17]Wait, what did you just crack open?
[58:53.93]Is it like a Coors Light?
[58:57.04]No, it was gum, dude.
[58:59.24]I got disconnected again.
[59:00.22]Is there something else we can do?
[59:02.22]I feel like I've torn you away from what you were doing.
[59:06.90]It's like, hey, it's been an hour and everything just sucks.
[59:09.30]Honestly, no.
[59:10.37]This was the plan from the beginning.
[59:12.60]this is not at all disrupting me or my streaming but I mean I kind of have to go soon anyway so this isn't really that big of a deal it's just a shame that this doesn't work because I was having fun yeah I really want to play it just watch you play I'm gonna we're gonna live vicariously through you yeah but even if you do watch me play I'm gonna get disconnected too I've been getting disconnected
[59:38.52]Alert.
[59:38.86]You have been disconnected from Red Dead Online due to a fault on Rockstar Games Services.
[59:47.46]When is the beta supposed to be done?
[59:52.65]A year?
[59:57.81]Alert.
[59:58.07]Hey, did you get the alert?
[60:01.41]I got an alert.
[60:03.21]Yep.
[60:04.19]I got it on my cell phone.
[60:06.57]Hey, please ping me.
[60:07.55]Please send me a text every time that the servers go down.
[60:12.12]By the way, I think Kryken was playing this not too long ago, so maybe we can get the old crew back together.
[60:17.62]Yeah, I'd love to actually play this because what's here would be fun.
[60:22.60]Yeah.
[60:23.62]Maybe not, you know, when the game is still broken, but when it's fixed, we can bug Kryken.
[60:31.21]Yeah, how many people can you have in, like, a squad?
[60:34.51]I think four.
[60:35.75]because I know uh four for a non-paid posse no you have to pay you have to actually pay for it with like in-game money that's kind of weird that's cool yeah what about critical critical is like he's a bigger YouTuber slash street like I guess more YouTuber but he's like such a big YouTuber I always feel bad bothering him I don't know it's hard to explain I would like to get critical involved
[61:02.62]He's not a very proactive person when it comes to stuff like this.
[61:08.12]He threw cards at me the other day, and I was screaming at him and stuff.
[61:12.36]So yeah, maybe he'll play.
[61:14.16]You think he would be down?
[61:15.71]Maybe, yeah.
[61:16.53]I'll give him a shot.
[61:17.73]I was going to talk to him anyways.
[61:20.51]So how about we make a plan without people expecting it to be like word of God?
[61:26.29]That it's going to happen 100%.
[61:27.79]But, when this game gets fixed, and when we can play with a stable connection, me, you, Criken, Critical, we'll try to get like a thing going.
[61:37.02]Oh, sick!
[61:38.90]That sounds good.
[61:40.32]Cool.
[61:41.90]And, uh, so, um, I think, uh, I don't know what your plan is.
[61:47.12]Are you going to just take off?
[61:50.04]What, tonight?
[61:51.00]Like, right now.
[61:52.37]Like right now.
[61:53.05]I'm gonna invite you one more time because I think the server's restarted.
[61:56.27]Oh, the server's restarted.
[61:58.09]Yeah, maybe.
[61:58.53]Okay.
[62:03.64]Somebody said, oh no, it's the end of the stream voice.
[62:08.84]Mine?
[62:10.04]Mine.
[62:11.02]Do you do a thing when you stream, when like, okay, let's say you've been streaming for, you know, six, seven, four, whatever, five.
[62:16.86]You're getting a little tired.
[62:18.22]Do you do like a, okay, so do you do like a, I'm going to end the stream voice?
[62:23.92]Yep.
[62:24.42]Yeah.
[62:25.48]I think so.
[62:30.80]I didn't just do it right there.
[62:32.58]Are you in game?
[62:33.91]I'm loading in right now.
[62:35.87]Okay, let me know when you've loaded in, because it says it wants me to invite... It wants to invite me to watch your stream.
[62:43.84]It wants to invite you to watch my stream.
[62:46.84]To watch your gameplay, yes.
[62:48.54]Oh, you're going to come watch my gameplay?
[62:50.90]That's what it wants, yeah.
[62:51.84]Share play?
[62:54.02]Yeah, it's the end of the phone call voice.
[62:56.58]Yeah, that's... When you talk to somebody on the phone... And you're like, yep, alright.
[63:03.76]Yeah, that's how people end conversations.
[63:05.78]You add some inflection to let people know that, hey, this is, like, the conversation's gonna be over here in a minute.
[63:12.40]My, uh, my, like, here's mine.
[63:14.34]Alright.
[63:16.28]Yeah.
[63:17.20]Alright.
[63:18.49]Alright.
[63:19.51]And then it goes up real high.
[63:20.67]Alright, yep.
[63:25.29]Mine is usually, uh, it starts with, okay, so, or it's, uh, but, uh, yeah.
[63:31.23]Okay, so, uh, I think, uh,
[63:34.62]How about cool?
[63:36.14]You're doing one of the cool.
[63:37.80]I don't know if I like cool, because cool kind of sounds like I'm not interested in the conversation, like a cool, alright, I gotta go.
[63:43.84]It's like, you didn't think that was cool.
[63:45.14]If you thought that was cool, you'd be sticking around a little bit longer, right?
[63:48.08]Yeah, it's a little passive-aggressive.
[63:49.96]Yeah.
[63:51.38]I think alright works, because alright's like, alright, like, it's over.
[63:53.74]Alright.
[63:56.79]How's the weather on your phone, by the way?
[63:59.35]My phone?
[63:59.85]It's pretty good.
[64:02.73]Yep.
[64:03.39]Alright.
[64:06.63]My invites are grayed out.
[64:08.41]Oh, there we go.
[64:08.99]I got you.
[64:09.39]Okay.
[64:09.67]The invites are still grayed out, but I can invite you to the posse.
[64:12.19]We're in the same server.
[64:13.37]Oh.
[64:14.01]Alright.
[64:14.41]Come find me.
[64:16.86]Come find me and come take a picture with me.
[64:20.04]Okay.
[64:20.48]Well, I think we should try to do... While we're in a server together, we should try to do like an actual fight match.
[64:27.82]Yeah.
[64:28.91]Okay.
[64:29.35]So it starts now then.
[64:31.91]I think we have to be in the posse.
[64:35.16]Oh, okay.
[64:35.76]I thought you meant, like, you and me are just gonna fight.
[64:38.08]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[64:40.52]I was gonna say we could do a, uh... Like, um... You know, like a team deathmatch thing.
[64:46.00]Oh, actually try to load... Yeah, try to load into one.
[64:48.72]No, that, uh... Uh, apparently the weather is a little too harsh on these... Yeah, I'm off.
[64:53.99]Disconnected.
[64:56.37]No shit already?
[64:57.17]No shit, yep.
[64:59.21]Already, this is way worse.
[65:00.71]We at least... Three days ago, we could play for at least 20, 30 minutes before it would do this.
[65:07.36]So... That's a shame.
[65:08.22]This is a shame.
[65:08.84]Well, I mean, this is not a bother to me.
[65:11.28]I want you to know that this is also affecting me.
[65:15.08]That's okay.
[65:15.46]It's affecting me too.
[65:16.64]Okay.
[65:17.12]I think let's just wait a little bit.
[65:18.97]Wait a couple days, and then we'll try again.
[65:22.13]That sounds good to me.
[65:23.11]I want to actually play this with you, but yeah, it's a shame that this isn't happening.
[65:28.44]It is a shame, but it's alright.
[65:30.14]It happens.
[65:31.12]Nothing to do about it.
[65:32.68]What are you gonna cry over spilled servers?
[65:36.25]I can jump off a cliff.
[65:38.41]Oh, I just did that.
[65:40.75]I love how that's both the go-to thing.
[65:42.37]Eh, whatever.
[65:44.25]Sleep off.
[65:48.27]You can't cry.
[65:49.52]You can't cry over spilled servers.
[65:52.32]No, you can't.
[65:54.60]I'm just gonna go and do like a showdown match.
[65:58.06]If, you know, I have like another 10-20 minutes that I'm gonna play this, so may as well play.
[66:04.62]Oh shit, someone got a jup!
[66:07.12]Can you explain, uh, is it, it's jup or jup?
[66:11.47]Uh, it is, it is Jupiter.
[66:14.43]Jup.
[66:15.79]Okay, because I've been saying, I think the chat tricked me into saying jup.
[66:18.59]They did.
[66:19.01]I was like, yeah, but it's Jupiter, it's pronounced jup.
[66:21.33]Yeah, they lied to you.
[66:21.95]They were like, nah, bro.
[66:23.33]Yeah, figures.
[66:24.16]I mean, I've said, I've clarified it at least a hundred times.
[66:27.76]It is Jupiter.
[66:28.72]The planet is Jupiter.
[66:29.55]It's not Juppiter.
[66:32.15]Oh yeah, there's the moon.
[66:32.99]There's the, oh, there's the, there's the Mon.
[66:35.77]There's Mers.
[66:37.67]What's back there?
[66:38.93]That's Venus.
[66:39.91]What else?
[66:41.41]Oh, Juppiter.
[66:42.09]Oh, of course.
[66:43.41]Behind that you got Plateau.
[66:45.06]Yeah.
[66:45.92]Plateau is my favorite.
[66:47.06]Yeah.
[66:47.32]Jupiter.
[66:49.68]Jupiter.
[66:51.06]So can I ask you why it exists?
[66:54.17]Because it's become a bit of a local chat.
[66:55.87]Like a lot of your memes have spilled over into my life.
[66:58.21]I want you to know that.
[66:59.32]Oh, I'm sorry.
[67:00.62]I don't mind.
[67:01.36]I'm sure it's been somewhat vice versa, but I'll take it.
[67:07.99]Well, I just one day was looking through... My mother got me a telescope when I was younger.
[67:16.76]And I've always been interested in the stars and the moon and everything.
[67:21.40]Oh, me too.
[67:23.52]Those are images that were taken.
[67:24.96]I'm into the planets and I think the solar system is really cool.
[67:30.33]Through the telescope, I have a picture.
[67:31.65]It's able to take photos.
[67:34.17]It's one of those things that, you know, oh, you can binoculars, it can take pictures.
[67:37.47]If you're at, like, the baseball game, or, like, you have a telescope, but you're at the baseball game, you want to get, like, a good close-up of a home plate and who's batting when you're in the bleachers.
[67:45.48]So, yeah, it's a telescopic view of just, that's just what they look like.
[67:50.05]Chad, is he lying?
[67:52.07]I mean, the telescope is an incredibly expensive... It's at least like a... It's like $145.
[67:59.35]It's like $144.99.
[68:00.43]No, that doesn't sound like an expensive telescope.
[68:03.29]I mean, it's the most expensive one you can get on Amazon, so... I believe you because... I don't know why I believe you, but I do, but I feel like I shouldn't.
[68:15.42]No, that's just what the planets look like.
[68:17.86]Go do it.
[68:18.26]Go do it.
[68:18.82]Wait, your mother got this for you when you were like 10?
[68:20.94]No, no.
[68:21.32]And you got it on Amazon?
[68:22.28]No, no, no.
[68:23.52]When I was younger, my mother got me a telescope.
[68:25.29]But it's what interests me so much in the solar system.
[68:28.01]So you bought another one.
[68:29.23]Yeah, so years later.
[68:30.25]Obviously, I'm a grown man now.
[68:32.89]You know, 24.
[68:34.33]And decided I was going to keep my passion going.
[68:38.79]And that's the solar system and the planets.
[68:40.17]And those are just images taken from the telescope.
[68:43.44]Wait, you're 24?
[68:43.74]What do you mean?
[68:49.88]Chat, how much is Jerma lying?
[68:51.36]85% of the time.
[68:54.78]That's probably what it is.
[68:58.61]No, he's your age.
[68:59.55]You're my age.
[69:02.43]Yeah, but I got... You know what?
[69:04.45]We're talking about like internal age, you know?
[69:06.45]Like... Right, right.
[69:07.65]How do you feel?
[69:08.73]I feel... Do you feel real?
[69:10.53]I feel like 45, but I mean, internally, I wish I was 25.
[69:15.19]Alright, I believe that.
[69:16.15]Alright, so I've been in the game for more than 30 seconds and I'm not disconnected yet.
[69:21.36]Wait, in my game?
[69:23.00]Am I in your game?
[69:25.10]Are you playing a deathmatch?
[69:27.14]Oh, I'm not, but I'm ready for you when you come out, maybe.
[69:30.08]It's possible.
[69:30.74]It's very possible we'll get to play for like 20 minutes.
[69:33.68]I like the idea that we're doing a co-op match of Red Dead, but playing separately.
[69:37.65]In separate servers.
[69:39.55]What is Sean doing here?
[69:43.39]So here's the thing.
[69:44.27]I wanted to actually tell you that I also had a telescope when I was younger.
[69:48.61]This is no bullshit.
[69:49.41]So when you say that, I was like fucking fascinated.
[69:51.91]I wanted to be an astronomer when I was a kid.
[69:54.07]And I had a telescope.
[69:54.95]I had books.
[69:55.57]I had the whole fucking thing.
[69:56.98]I'm dead serious, which then turned into alien conspiracies, which was the wrong way to go about that.
[70:04.63]Conspiracies.
[70:06.61]Yeah.
[70:07.77]That's true.
[70:09.27]Well, think about it.
[70:10.19]No, but like, honest to God, when you start to really think about, especially when you're younger, what's up there?
[70:17.23]You know what I mean?
[70:17.67]You're looking up there, there's like planets and the moon's up there.
[70:20.02]What the fuck is up there?
[70:22.16]Jupiter.
[70:23.46]Jupiter's up there.
[70:24.34]Mm-hmm.
[70:27.20]So, if that's true and you got that from your telescope, that's kind of cool.
[70:30.74]Yeah.
[70:31.36]Yeah.
[70:34.12]People said, Jeremy, your emotes don't make any sense.
[70:38.35]And I'm like, okay.
[70:39.85]Go look.
[70:41.67]Go look through a telescope of what the moon looks like.
[70:44.07]That's just an image.
[70:47.77]It's an image.
[70:48.65]There's a lot of people that are spouting bullshit about me.
[70:56.20]They keep using the word doctor, like doctor.
[70:58.26]I'm not a doctor.
[71:00.26]I'm a fucking streamer.
[71:05.67]Wait, you're not?
[71:07.67]No.
[71:07.97]So what are some jobs you've had that you've had before you were streaming?
[71:12.05]I'm just curious.
[71:12.96]Doctor.
[71:14.14]Physician, mostly.
[71:15.50]Okay.
[71:16.26]So those two separate things that... No.
[71:22.40]Oddly enough, I was a substitute teacher for a long time.
[71:26.04]Substitute.
[71:27.54]That's cool.
[71:29.40]I did wedding videos for a while.
[71:35.20]Oh, video editing?
[71:36.26]Yeah.
[71:36.64]Yeah.
[71:37.00]It's kind of how I... I did some of that too, actually.
[71:39.73]Yeah.
[71:40.07]Video editing, video... just making.
[71:44.93]Freelance just kind of on the side when I did other stuff.
[71:51.10]I got real gripping, thrilling stuff going on over here.
[71:54.38]Thanks for hanging out, guys.
[71:55.57]Oh, no, no, I'm talking about on my stream.
[71:58.09]How was the weather around those jobs?
[72:00.51]It was fucking beautiful.
[72:02.27]No, I'm talking about just on my stream.
[72:04.07]I'm just riding on a road, just holding X. I got real thrilling stuff over here.
[72:12.24]As you can see.
[72:12.78]Look at those indentations.
[72:15.18]I can't invite you to the match I'm in, but I'm going to try to join yours.
[72:21.62]No, just do your thing.
[72:22.74]I've come to the realization that this is probably just too good to be true.
[72:29.11]And you're going to get in here.
[72:30.79]I'm going to take a quality photo of you coming into the stream, into the server.
[72:35.79]And then it's going to go... Disconnect.
[72:43.03]That's what I'm hoping.
[72:43.99]No, I'm not.
[72:44.67]What?
[72:45.41]I'm not hoping that happens.
[72:47.39]I've become so conditioned to think it's going to.
[72:51.84]no I'm not in your server but I will I'm gonna get in there well maybe we get a chance to do something one more one more match let's see I love that urn hern thing that's so I love it thanks man I yeah I figured that would you know that's the natural evolution of Arthur's show iron iron pal bosh bait
[73:16.89]Okay, you've been in a match.
[73:18.05]You've been in a server for six minutes without disconnect, apparently.
[73:20.77]Yeah, it's remarkable.
[73:22.39]I'm going to join yours.
[73:25.19]I want a good photo of me.
[73:28.01]This looks pretty good right here with the snowy mountaintop.
[73:35.24]Be careful.
[73:35.70]Okay, I'm good.
[73:37.16]So I got a good spot for you to come on in when you get in here.
[73:46.04]Cool.
[73:47.27]Enable focus lock.
[73:49.97]So are you excited for the Detective Pokémon movie?
[73:54.13]Detective Pokémon?
[73:55.39]Yeah.
[73:57.07]I'm excited for it.
[73:59.25]I think it looks really fun.
[74:03.81]I think so.
[74:05.59]I think so about you.
[74:08.74]Did you play Pokémon Let's Go?
[74:11.08]I've never played a Pokémon game before in my life.
[74:14.36]Really?
[74:15.16]So you're
[74:17.35]Huh.
[74:18.11]Never.
[74:21.58]Pokémon, uh... I think I did try... to play... Pokémon, uh... Diamond?
[74:28.20]Or Pearl?
[74:28.68]Whatever that was, the one for DS.
[74:29.91]Oh, there you are.
[74:30.37]Look.
[74:30.99]Okay, I got a good photo of you.
[74:37.43]That one's going in the album of friends.
[74:39.82]Oh.
[74:45.03]You're fine.
[74:47.35]You just gave me a new face.
[74:48.81]Hey, mister!
[74:54.59]Alright, so... We're still here.
[74:58.52]We're not disconnected.
[74:59.44]That's amazing.
[75:00.90]Yeah, neither of us are ghosts.
[75:02.90]Holy shit.
[75:03.96]I guess join the posse and then we'll go shoot some stuff and see if that lasts.
[75:09.05]Uh, posse.
[75:10.73]I see your posse.
[75:12.13]I cannot join.
[75:13.18]This posse is closed and cannot be joined.
[75:16.11]And I have no invites.
[75:27.13]This is just what happens when you go to, like, the bird exhibit at the local zoo.
[75:31.21]Right?
[75:34.00]The bird room?
[75:34.98]Yeah, this is the bird room.
[75:37.34]Oh, Jesus.
[75:38.20]See ya.
[75:39.34]Goodbye.
[75:39.80]See you later.
[75:40.28]God damn it.
[75:42.06]You know what's funny?
[75:44.63]Your horse is still here.
[75:45.59]Yeah, he's got a better connection to Rockstar, apparently, than I do.
[75:52.49]But anyways, just to follow up on the bird exhibit, have you been to a butterfly exhibit?
[75:58.43]I have, yeah.
[75:59.15]Well, I mean, I remember the one time I was in Texas, in Galveston, there was a butterfly room in some place, and I went in there for a bit.
[76:09.30]I don't know why I'm telling you this, but yes, yes.
[76:12.08]Well, I mean, it's important because the bird room, the butterfly room is like the bird room .5.
[76:20.00]But the scary part about the butterfly room is, aren't you just terrified of just being in there?
[76:24.88]Because there's just butterflies in every direction.
[76:27.32]They're above you, they're below you, they're left and right.
[76:29.46]I feel like I'm just gonna, like, Godzilla stomp on one of them.
[76:33.33]Yeah, like, devastate one, right?
[76:34.77]Mm-hmm.
[76:35.71]Or breathe one in.
[76:36.67]Maybe not that.
[76:41.65]Breathe one in.
[76:42.87]Like, throw your nose into your lungs.
[76:45.44]Yeah.
[76:46.02]Ugh!
[76:47.79]I guess that was kind of a weird thing to say, but yeah, I thought maybe that was a problem.
[76:52.79]Next time I go to a butterfly room.
[76:54.87]Was it Moody Gardens?
[76:56.33]Uh, does Moody Gardens have a butterfly room?
[77:02.80]Moody Gardens, Butterfly.
[77:04.24]Maybe I made that up.
[77:05.20]Maybe I lied.
[77:06.42]Yeah, they have them.
[77:07.18]Butterfly.
[77:07.90]Rainforest Pyramid, yeah.
[77:09.32]That's that.
[77:10.10]Yep, I've been to Moody Gardens.
[77:13.20]Jesus Christ, I was 18 when that happened.
[77:15.84]It was 15 years ago.
[77:16.56]That's as old as some of you.
[77:19.45]No offense.
[77:20.45]That's a... Do you forget how long ago 15 years ago is?
[77:24.13]You know what I mean?
[77:26.31]Yeah, I know.
[77:26.75]That's a decade and a half.
[77:29.69]Well, I mean, playing on green up time again is weird for that reason.
[77:33.75]Brings back a lot of memories.
[77:34.71]So what were you saying then?
[77:36.49]I was making a callback.
[77:39.38]I was going, okay, so, but... Alright, alright.
[77:46.60]How's the weather around?
[77:47.56]Let's end this.
[77:50.22]Let me see.
[77:51.22]What's it going to be like?
[77:52.44]It's going to be cloudy with a chance of meatballs.
[77:56.80]Why am I typing that in?
[77:58.68]Cloudy with a chance of disconnect.
[78:00.78]2009 is when that came out, if anyone's curious.
[78:04.18]No, sorry, everybody.
[78:06.90]I really figured it was going to be fun.
[78:09.28]I'm sure it was nice to have you as a special guest.
[78:11.28]Honestly, my audience always really enjoys talking about you, whether it be in a positive or negative way.
[78:17.06]They enjoy you quite a bit.
[78:19.36]Well, thank you.
[78:22.08]Thank you, everybody in the Vinesauce chat.
[78:24.12]Appreciate it.
[78:25.54]thank you Jerma chat for tolerating me for a couple minutes uh everybody over here loves you dude well you you are like everybody earns you over here so don't worry that's good that is nice I like that that's a good compliment
[78:39.02]But we'll try again.
[78:39.90]You know, let's see what happens during the week.
[78:44.88]Listen, I've been having disconnects too, so maybe one day we'll both be able to play this.
[78:49.77]And until then, I guess, you know, take care of yourself.
[78:53.91]Go find some good pictures of planets.
[78:55.81]Yeah.
[78:57.59]And you yourself go look up, go get a telescope and look.
[79:00.61]And you'll see.
[79:02.52]One day I will, maybe.
[79:03.36]Alright, have a good one.
[79:05.60]And until then, I'm gonna go kill a couple dudes, and then, uh, you know, we'll be in touch.
[79:09.44]We'll meet somewhere in the middle.
[79:10.68]Yeah, fuck yeah.
[79:11.24]So take care, Jerma.
[79:12.00]Yeah, see you later, guys.
[79:12.98]Take care.
[79:13.54]Bye.
[79:17.93]Oh, I wanted to fucking play Mommy Player!
[79:21.01]I wanted to play Mommy Player!
[79:23.67]Oh, I was keeping it so, so collected the whole time!
[79:29.91]I just wanted to play with my friend!
[79:32.73]Tears are fucking pouring down my face!
[79:38.80]You know how hard it is to contain yourself?
[79:41.60]No, that's unfortunate.
[79:42.34]It really is.
[79:43.36]I thought this was going to be fixed, but... Vinny and Va... Great guy.
[79:54.11]Highly recommend.
[79:56.09]If you do not follow that stream, give it a follow.
[80:00.42]So we can talk about one thing here.
[80:03.00]The plan today got a little messed up.
[80:09.87]Vinny and Vine.
[80:17.19]Yeah, it's apparently been happening all day.
[80:18.45]The plan was we were only gonna play this for like two or three hours.
[80:23.73]So, it's kind of at the point where I'm- I- the plan was I was only gonna stream for like two or three hours anyways.
[80:31.34]So, I'm sorry guys that this kind of in the middle extra stream here turned out to be a little bit of a, uh, you know what I mean?
[80:41.77]For tomorrow, the reason why the stream was not going to be very long is because I'm going to prepare the movie night.
[80:47.63]I want to make sure it's ready to go.
[80:48.63]I want to make sure that it is... perfect.
[80:54.14]There are a lot of submissions.
[80:55.54]There are a lot of... There's a lot of work that went into it, so... That plan was I was going to only stream for an hour or two.
[81:01.94]And I just deleted an hour for some reason because it's been an hour or two and I'm just like... I'm like inceptioning that into your brain that the stream is only going to be an hour.
[81:10.18]I'm so excited for it.
[81:11.00]I'm looking forward to it.
[81:11.82]It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[81:13.32]So I'm gonna end the stream here.
[81:16.88]Again, I'm sorry about the Rockstar servers.
[81:19.33]I really, really thought after a few days it was gonna be fixed.
[81:22.75]So I'm gonna go.
[81:23.47]I'm gonna go fix... not fix my internet.
[81:27.18]I'm so used to saying that.
[81:31.35]But I'm gonna go prepare.
[81:32.43]I want to make sure I put a lot of time into the movie night.
[81:35.63]So... Take care.
[81:39.08]I'll go through the bits.
[81:39.74]It's probably gonna be very quick.
[81:42.51]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[81:43.33]If you don't know what I'm talking about, we're doing a movie night tomorrow where I gave like two or three hours of Brainstreet footage to everybody in this entire community and some of the incredibly talented and creative, funny fucking people that are here have made some great shit to watch tomorrow.
[82:01.11]In the stream tomorrow, probably only going to be like a couple hours, two or three hours.
[82:03.99]I don't want to have it overstates welcome.
[82:05.44]I don't want it to be one of those scenarios where it's like
[82:07.54]Alright, we're like five hours in and like here's another like me keyed in front of Minecraft.
[82:13.12]Because, you know, it's inevitable.
[82:16.52]But there are a lot of really funny fucking people in this community.
[82:22.46]And I'm really looking forward to it.
[82:23.86]It's been in the making for like four months.
[82:26.34]And I'm just really glad that it's going to be actually a thing we do tomorrow.
[82:31.47]So, let me go.
[82:33.83]Let's do the bits.
[82:35.83]Really quickly.
[82:38.84]If you just showed up, sorry.
[82:40.58]I didn't even tweet this stream out.
[82:42.02]I'm glad I didn't.
[82:43.64]Because, you know.
[82:46.66]Unfortunately.
[82:50.60]There isn't actually that much Minecraft.
[82:52.08]I know.
[82:52.30]I'm just kidding around.
[82:53.54]I'm just playing around.
[82:55.12]For what was there, I hope you enjoyed just hanging out.
[82:56.90]Because we kind of just hung out and talked about the weather.
[82:59.28]For like an hour.
[83:01.78]If Vinny is streaming, go watch him.
[83:03.24]If Etalyx is streaming, go watch him.
[83:05.48]While I work on some stuff.
[83:12.93]What time tomorrow?
[83:13.61]Tomorrow at 4 p.m.
[83:15.32]Pacific time is when the stream is going to start.
[83:18.12]4 p.m.
[83:19.52]Pacific.
[83:25.71]Which is 7 p.m.
[83:27.07]Eastern.
[83:28.37]And I am trying to...
[83:31.54]Uh, I am trying to, because I've been so used to telling everybody times in Eastern, and I feel like there's a lot of people that still, um, when I say, oh, four o'clock, a lot of people don't know I mean Pacific, because I've been so, it's just, for three, four years, it's been Eastern.
[83:48.65]So, that's why I keep saying the Eastern times as well.
[83:53.99]It was fun watching you two go off cliffs together.
[83:56.03]Yeah, it was.
[83:59.18]But, thank you, uh,
[84:01.55]Thank you again, everybody.
[84:02.41]Thank you, Daph Skeletor, for the $10.
[84:04.29]No message, $10.
[84:07.15]Coconut, thanks for the $1.
[84:08.91]$2, actually.
[84:09.78]$3!
[84:10.82]They say, uh, plug, walk.
[84:15.40]I don't know what that means.
[84:16.56]Thank you, Divus, for the $5.
[84:17.74]No message.
[84:20.72]Hawkeye, thank you, Hawkeye, for the $30, Hawkeye.
[84:23.38]$30, a little more than an hour ago.
[84:30.66]They say, hey there, Jerma, works pretty slow right now, and there's a snowstorm outside, so I decided to pop in and give these that have been meeting to donate.
[84:38.93]I work pretty late, so I'm resigned to be a slimy vaude boy, but the laughs are always well worth it.
[84:45.09]See you around.
[84:46.75]Thank you for the $30, and... Slimy vaude boy, that's... Slimy vaude boy, but thank you so much, Hawkeye.
[85:02.50]$30.
[85:02.98]Lots of money.
[85:03.50]Sorry that the stream that you gave that money on was... I would not even classify the... It's been like an hour and a half.
[85:14.25]Don't worry.
[85:14.77]Tomorrow night we got a very, very good, fun stream ready to go.
[85:18.76]So, thank you.
[85:20.46]Well, you just said Shrek, so I'm censoring the rest of this comment.
[85:22.40]One by the guy who made the Minions and the fan-made one.
[85:24.54]The fan-made one called Shrek Retold was released two days ago.
[85:27.04]Every scene is directed by a different artist.
[85:51.45]What movie would you want remade by fans?
[86:00.81]I don't know.
[86:01.39]Probably... I don't know.
[86:04.16]Maybe you could try... Why am I taking this comment seriously?
[86:08.96]What movie would... I would say... Crocodile Dundee.
[86:18.48]There's some stuff there that could be done, maybe.
[86:21.38]Uh, thank you, Jess, for the $1.
[86:22.94]When I was a kid, I used to say, uh... Chey-Cane instead of Keychain.
[86:29.40]I couldn't shake it for years.
[86:30.90]I would also say Shun-Shine every time.
[86:33.79]I remember this.
[86:34.47]I can't say it normally for days after.
[86:36.23]Treasure Trust.
[86:38.27]It's a Treasure Trust at this point.
[86:39.73]It's not a Treasure Chest.
[86:41.17]It's hard to say it the other way.
[86:44.95]But thank you.
[86:45.41]Thank you, ExtraCheesy, for the $1.
[86:46.75]He says he doesn't eat, but yeah, the whole taquitos things.
[86:51.47]ExtraCheesy, thanks again for the $10 here.
[86:53.57]Here's what you said you never did before.
[86:58.63]Nope.
[87:08.46]What the hell is this?
[87:09.62]I'm eating taco... You drive, dude.
[87:14.17]I'm eating.
[87:16.85]That's not even me.
[87:20.72]Eat four taquitos at the same time.
[87:22.69]Hold on.
[87:23.17]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[87:25.57]When did I do this?
[87:29.11]I don't remember putting, like, five fucking taquitos in my mouth.
[87:34.75]Hold on a second.
[87:50.71]Nope.
[87:53.35]This is one of the last streams before I left.
[87:55.21]Oh.
[87:55.49]Oh, okay.
[88:00.87]Four?
[88:03.23]One, two, three, four.
[88:06.37]I don't do this, do I?
[88:07.49]This is a joke, right?
[88:11.67]I'm not doing it.
[88:12.65]I knew I...
[88:22.38]I knew it.
[88:23.62]I knew I wasn't gonna do it.
[88:25.60]We got a helicopter, dude!
[88:26.60]We got a helicopter!
[88:28.04]Okay, I'm not bad enough at that.
[88:34.79]I thought you guys were talking about Vinny.
[88:41.65]I've never eaten a taquito in my life.
[88:46.01]It's so funny because that wasn't like five years ago.
[88:49.75]That wasn't like three years ago.
[88:50.95]That was like two months ago.
[89:03.54]How do you guys remember these things?
[89:05.58]Good thing you keep me honest.
[89:07.88]Uh, but thank you, ExtraCheesy, for that.
[89:09.14]$10, $11, $12.
[89:10.38]And, uh, I want the red badge.
[89:15.45]Thank you, ExtraCheesy.
[89:17.61]Red badge.
[89:18.11]That's too bad.
[89:20.57]That's too bad.
[89:39.52]But, I would be more upset about this if, because I know that he... When we talked about doing this, it was like, oh, let's do this, it sounds like fun, like, let's give it a few days, though, because there's internet problems, there's, like, Rockstar servers are kind of fucked up, or whatever, right?
[89:54.71]I'm just glad that he was already streaming something, he was doing something, this wasn't like a, okay, here's the stream for today.
[90:01.81]He had already been, he's playing, like, Ocarina of Time, and I'm really glad that it wasn't just like, oh, hey, like, let's just, let's just ruin this stream.
[90:10.12]So.
[90:12.10]And on this end, at least, that this was an in-between to tomorrow.
[90:17.01]And we streamed yesterday, streaming tomorrow, and I'm just glad that this wasn't, you know, oh, that's it.
[90:25.11]Red Dead Connection.
[90:28.97]But, yeah.
[90:30.55]Sorry again, everybody.
[90:32.56]I wish I could snap my fingers and magically have it not happen, but... I'm actually going to do a little bit of research.
[90:39.76]Because the stuff that I read about it, there's, like, workarounds.
[90:43.66]And I tried the workarounds already.
[90:45.85]They didn't work.
[90:47.67]But maybe there's some other things to try.
[90:50.77]But thank you, Marvush Magali.
[90:52.09]Thank you, Hunter Kane, for the $1.
[90:53.05]I have some bits.
[90:53.95]Thanks.
[90:55.40]Mostly lost, thanks for the $1.
[90:56.64]You should host Vinny or Etalyx.
[90:58.56]You do know how the host button works, right?
[91:02.10]Um, I don't know what... You mean, like, they appear... Like, I hope they appear inside of me.
[91:09.43]What do you mean?
[91:16.42]Like, I have to be inside... That's like a tapeworm.
[91:19.30]I don't think I want that.
[91:24.40]That's how the movie Venom starts.
[91:25.84]I don't think I want that.
[91:32.15]Hey, thank you Djack for the $1.
[91:37.99]I rewatched the Zoo Tycoon stream and nearly shit myself with the T-Rex not being able to find his car joke.
[91:42.49]Keep bringing the chuckles.
[91:46.68]Thank you, Djack.
[91:47.78]It was a fun stream.
[91:50.92]Spoilers.
[91:51.74]Oh, sorry.
[91:52.36]Sorry, guys.
[91:52.98]Venom is a symbiote.
[91:55.66]Sorry.
[91:56.72]Sorry for the spoils.
[91:58.62]And SmellyBoy right at the end, when are you going to play Metal Gear Rising?
[92:01.22]Tomorrow.
[92:02.10]No, it's a lie.
[92:02.66]I'm kidding.
[92:03.08]Not tomorrow.
[92:04.49]Tomorrow we're doing the... No.
[92:12.88]Tomorrow we're doing the movie night.
[92:18.28]How long is the stream gonna be tomorrow?
[92:21.10]That's up for potential debate, because... After I turn the stream off here, I'm gonna go to the bathroom, gonna go grab a drink and then sit down and really get it hammered out.
[92:33.30]And... I don't know.
[92:35.42]I'm gonna assume it's gonna be like less than two or three hours long.
[92:38.46]Because we're just gonna be watching a playlist.
[92:41.18]We're watching a huge community playlist.
[92:46.42]So, I'm going to assume up to three hours.
[92:51.98]It's one minute max, two minutes max.
[92:55.52]I plan on, I'm just going to tell you, just a fair warning, I plan on drinking a little bit of wine.
[93:00.86]Just some.
[93:02.50]It's been a couple, it's been like two or three weeks since I've had some good wine, you know.
[93:09.17]It's going to be a red blend.
[93:11.65]But that is it.
[93:13.99]Here come the credits for the short stream that was here.
[93:17.95]Thank you for subscribing and contributing, everybody.
[93:22.48]It means a lot.
[93:25.78]I wish it was better circumstances.
[93:29.54]He's going to eat food and forget.
[93:35.36]And there's also a very, very real possibility where
[93:41.05]the it's broken up into two nights you know what I mean because if there are if there's more than four five hours of videos to watch then it might it'll be better probably to break it up into two separate occasions
[94:04.67]It depends.
[94:05.21]I mean, maybe we'll just do the whole thing.
[94:06.63]It really depends on how long the whole... After going through and making sure that it's cleaned up and some duplicates are removed or ones that weren't following the rules or ones that just didn't make any sense.
[94:20.50]Once it's cleaned up a little bit, we'll find out.
[94:34.17]I can watch it at x2 speed.
[94:40.75]Don't watch them!
[94:41.87]What do you mean, don't watch them?
[94:44.55]Ones that don't make any sense?
[94:45.57]Well, here's what I'm talking about.
[94:47.47]If we need to shave time off,
[94:50.69]here's the reason why these all had to be screened and had to be, like, predetermined if they were capable of being on, because the rules that I set forth were original content encouraged, uh, more than 10 seconds, less than 2 minutes, like, give or take.
[95:06.52]Some people, if you go over by 5 seconds or so, like, okay, as long as the, or 10 seconds, whatever, if the video was made well, we're just trying to see how that works, but...
[95:17.56]There weren't very many other rules in regards to, well, I mean, obviously there was no hateful shit, there was no sexual stuff, obviously, but the reason why we have to go through them all is because somebody could just put up, hey, here's my submission, and it's a minute and 58 seconds of a black screen, and then it flashes me on the screen for one second.
[95:38.66]That one's not going on, we're not putting that one on the video, you know what I mean?
[95:41.51]That's not going on.
[95:44.24]Like, that shit's not going on.
[95:46.14]That's just a waste of time, you know what I mean?
[95:48.85]Time is of the essence tomorrow.
[95:54.85]And so there's been there's been a few submissions that have just been just absolute just carnage this just keyed out just volume at max blasting music and just Like it and every one of the green screens just like flying around and stuff for like two minutes There's been some wild submissions so we need to make sure that we have ones that aren't going to be obviously, you know blow anybody's ears out and
[96:30.35]That sounds amazing.
[96:32.07]And if- yo, I didn't say there was anything wrong with it, but for the purposes of tomorrow's viewing, it needs to- it needs to be at least fairly structured.
[96:50.04]I'm trying to abstain from watching as many of them as I can, but there are a lot of occasions where I do have to watch them, because I'm not sure, is this one okay, is this one kind of pushing the line a little bit, and I have to watch them, I have to watch a lot of them, pretty much.
[97:04.28]But, because there's been, the mod team has been doing an absolutely fucking fantastic job to keep this where I don't see very many of them, you know what I mean?
[97:18.20]but they do need to be watched, and I go, alright, I don't know about that.
[97:24.83]Have somebody watch them for you.
[97:26.67]That is essentially what the mods have been doing.
[97:33.63]It's been a huge fucking help.
[97:36.19]They deserve praise, they deserve all the love you can give them.
[97:43.70]And they deserve compensation.
[97:45.88]So,
[97:49.58]Because that's a lot of work.
[97:53.45]Especially this.
[97:59.61]Yeah, coming... Bits coming your way!
[98:02.15]Because, I mean, like, I'll be real here for a minute.
[98:10.92]There are... There's been occasions where... You know, you just can't do it alone.
[98:16.63]You know what I mean?
[98:18.39]There's been at least three or four streams that... It just... Without the help of at least three, four of these mods... There's no way that the streams would have even been a reality.
[98:30.51]Never would have been a reality, ever.
[98:32.81]So... Big thanks.
[98:41.56]Reality.
[98:44.88]And thank you all the subs, everybody that just came in.
[98:48.56]Get excited for tomorrow, it's gonna be a lot of fun.
[99:00.21]And finally... Right at the very end... We had... Mostly lost with the dollar, also thanks to you I'm never gonna be able to drink a red blend again without laughing.
[99:08.58]Oh come on, it's the best!
[99:10.32]It's the best.
[99:10.80]I should've asked... I should've asked Viddy about that.
[99:15.72]He would know.
[99:16.32]He would be like, yeah, of course.
[99:19.53]Mr. Picklesworth, thanks for the $1.
[99:20.85]Hey, Jerma, how you doing today?
[99:21.79]I think I got banned from the Discord because I said I give... I give... back a couple of times in the chat when you took away the image posting.
[99:33.35]Sorry if my messages were spammy.
[99:37.05]Hit up one of the mods in a private message.
[99:40.67]They will take care of it.
[99:41.43]They will just... they will take a look and see what happened.
[99:49.47]I hope it's not too late for you to see this.
[99:52.13]No.
[99:55.80]And just, also remember something, if you, if somebody gets the, from the Discord or in this channel, if you get, like, banned, for the, all bans, like, permanent, we're talking, like, bans, are discussed, and it's not just like, hey, you got banned.
[100:16.23]And there's usually a dialog you can open up to potentially talk about what happened, or why, or... That does happen, so... All hands are disgust.
[100:41.01]Can I negotiate why I should be banned?
[100:43.03]Yeah!
[100:45.40]You could.
[100:46.18]If you really wanted to.
[100:50.78]But that's going to be it.
[100:52.64]See you guys tomorrow.
[100:53.46]4 p.m.
[100:54.48]Pacific.
[100:57.00]I'm excited.
[100:57.86]You're excited.
[100:58.64]We're all excited.
[101:01.30]Have a wonderful rest of your evening.
[101:04.84]Sorry again for Rockstar's server's not working.
[101:10.46]Good night.
[101:11.80]Take care.
[101:13.60]See you tomorrow.
[101:29.46]Thank you.
