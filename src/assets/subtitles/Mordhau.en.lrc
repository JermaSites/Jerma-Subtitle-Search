[00:01.78]Hey there.
[00:02.16]Hi.
[00:04.05]How's it going?
[00:07.37]People watching the VOD have no idea about what?
[00:11.81]I wasn't late.
[00:12.51]I was there exactly at 3.59 p.m.
[00:14.07]Yeah, I was just talking to Mr. Etalyx.
[00:24.74]He expressed interest in hopping in a little later.
[00:32.76]He's like, yeah, I kinda wanna play.
[00:34.00]So I was like, yeah, whatever.
[00:36.38]So we might see him in an hour or two.
[00:41.96]Maybe sooner, we'll see.
[00:46.85]Tell him you don't want it.
[00:50.13]That's, like, so rude.
[00:52.19]Why would I do that?
[00:55.59]Hey, man, yeah, like, it's a game that has multiplayer and stuff.
[00:57.99]Like, yeah, I'll play with you.
[00:59.33]No, I don't want you.
[01:02.90]That's like, why?
[01:05.20]It's like a co-op game, isn't it?
[01:08.76]What are you fucking talking about?
[01:10.84]Anywho, hi guys.
[01:12.36]Here's the plan.
[01:13.66]We're gonna do Mordhau.
[01:15.28]I hope I'm saying that right.
[01:16.79]Probably not, but you know.
[01:20.47]One guy said that?
[01:22.59]You must be new here.
[01:27.47]5,000 of you could write the same sentence and I wouldn't see it.
[01:33.09]They would be one person in between that 5,000 sentences of the same sentence.
[01:39.39]And I would read that one out loud.
[01:41.78]It's like my brain finds patterns and then goes for the thing that's not the pattern.
[01:47.98]I'm always connecting patterns with words and language, so...
[01:56.23]But yeah, we're going to do Mordhau tonight.
[01:58.53]I don't know how long we'll do this for.
[02:01.67]Who knows?
[02:02.03]I might get addicted to this game, and it might be the only thing I play.
[02:06.80]You know, I think I'm going to get so good at this game.
[02:08.76]I'm going to play it so much.
[02:10.18]I'm going to make a movie.
[02:11.76]I'm going to make a game.
[02:12.54]I'm going to make a horror game in Mordhau 2.
[02:15.48]I'm going to spend all night playing Mordhau, and that's all I'm going to do.
[02:18.88]And tomorrow, you'll see some more Mordhau of me, of what I've been able to come up with.
[02:27.31]But no, Dreams is a lot deeper of a game.
[02:30.93]I want to spend more time with it.
[02:32.93]So what we're going to do with Dreams is we're going to spend... That's a new lie.
[02:38.07]No, it's not a new lie.
[02:39.19]It was never a lie in the first place.
[02:42.15]Did you look at the tutorials for Dreams?
[02:44.66]Yes.
[02:46.16]I did look at them.
[02:47.28]I looked at them.
[02:49.10]There was quite a few of them.
[02:49.84]I looked at them.
[02:51.84]I mean, I didn't do any of them.
[02:53.18]I looked at them, though, and I looked at them.
[02:58.28]Now, speaking of tutorials, we've got one to do here.
[03:01.52]So we might as well hurry this up.
[03:06.72]So let's go ahead and get that off.
[03:07.96]I don't have the camera on right now.
[03:10.38]Hey, look at that.
[03:12.12]This is Mordhau.
[03:12.93]It is a first-person medieval multiplayer action attack-each-other game.
[03:22.43]Looks like fun.
[03:24.49]A lot of people were requesting this yesterday.
[03:28.11]So I figured I'd give it a try.
[03:30.31]And let me make sure the audio is okay.
[03:33.11]Make sure it's not too loud.
[03:36.57]It is probably way too loud.
[03:38.68]You're going to have to tell me.
[03:39.70]You're going to have to yell at me.
[03:41.84]It's probably a little bit better.
[03:44.70]That's okay.
[03:50.02]So, I have no idea how this works.
[03:51.40]We get $2,500 when we complete it.
[03:56.65]So let's play it.
[03:59.13]Let's go.
[04:02.81]Takes approximately 15 minutes.
[04:04.57]Now that's the kind of tutorial I like.
[04:07.47]Only 15 minutes.
[04:11.23]Hold on, I gotta fucking stall for a second so I can tweet it.
[04:15.38]I do this thing where I make a tweet before, and then I accidentally just cancel the tweet, and then have to redo it.
[04:22.22]What I'm saying is, I'm just fucking not intelligent.
[04:26.58]It's all been a lie.
[04:30.62]I had, uh, two IQ tests.
[04:32.34]Yes, I did.
[04:32.94]They were VERY bad.
[04:37.14]And I just tell everybody on the internet that I'm smart so people THINK that I'm smart.
[04:41.60]Don't you understand?
[04:42.32]Ah, hold on, okay.
[04:46.40]Mordhau... Land- what did I- Landlord?
[04:52.71]No, Lardlord.
[04:54.53]I should just change it to Landlord.
[05:01.37]Why is it lard lord?
[05:04.49]twitch.tv This is not pre- why is this pre-recorded?
[05:13.34]What- I don't understand.
[05:14.68]How do you- how can you guys, uh, determine that?
[05:18.52]What makes something pre-recorded?
[05:19.88]What is it?
[05:20.32]What does it take?
[05:25.90]Is this the way I'm talking?
[05:27.52]Like, okay, so let me type this in.
[05:29.52]Is it?
[05:31.18]Press end for a new beginning.
[05:32.70]Look at what the cat dragged in.
[05:35.40]You two look absolutely hopeless.
[05:37.86]I'm fucking huge.
[05:38.62]Go on, look around.
[05:40.22]This is the place where I'll teach you how to fight without stopping yourself in the process.
[05:44.25]P and his first prayer.
[05:45.73]Okay, hold on.
[05:46.23]I need to, this is, sensitivity's way too high.
[05:48.87]Alright, that's quite enough sightseeing for now.
[05:51.21]Eyes on me, you two.
[05:53.48]Mouse x-axis?
[05:54.65]Oh, shit, I hate when they do this.
[05:58.67]I can never get this right.
[06:00.05]I always accidentally make it like two points higher.
[06:03.94]It's gonna be lower than that.
[06:04.94]All the pros told me.
[06:05.86]0.50, 0.50.
[06:08.30]Right?
[06:14.47]That's better.
[06:16.09]Maybe a little bit higher.
[06:17.89]Okay, go back to first person.
[06:19.33]That seems to happen quite frequently.
[06:20.73]Where's your sword, recruit?
[06:22.55]Where's your sword?
[06:23.23]Sword!
[06:23.49]Dummy.
[06:23.61]That's not the dummy.
[06:27.41]The dummy's behind me.
[06:45.31]Left mouse button to perform an attack.
[06:46.73]Here's the... Oh, look at that.
[06:48.43]That's the direction that you go.
[06:51.25]So you come from each angle.
[07:00.38]Mm-hmm.
[07:06.42]Combo.
[07:08.88]Press the left mouse button to perform an attack.
[07:10.50]While that attack is halfway through, press the left mouse button again to execute another follow-up attack.
[07:16.46]Easy enough.
[07:17.88]Alright, he's fine.
[07:18.70]Holy shit, I fucking slit his throat like five times.
[07:22.10]What a classic Trevor joke!
[07:47.85]I played enough Sekiro to know how to do this.
[07:51.90]Toymen.
[07:52.16]Right before, okay.
[07:52.78]Here we go.
[08:16.65]Excellent repose Jesus one more thing about power yet It only lasts a short while the way you turn your hips can make your weapon it sooner or later This can be used to create your opponents toy me try to block three of my strikes as I turn in and out of them Okay, good One more
[08:41.17]You're only coming from one direction.
[08:42.43]Ah, stamina.
[08:42.97]He just took my... Hold on, we gotta get a classic fucking Jerva YouTube joke.
[09:02.08]So that's E. If you have no... Pick it up.
[09:04.52]If you have no inventory space, press G to drop what you're carrying.
[09:07.30]I see.
[09:07.70]Okay.
[09:08.12]Move your mouse slightly to the left or right and press left mouse button to execute a horizontal attack.
[09:14.58]Yeah.
[09:14.70]So you kind of just... Like that.
[09:15.68]I see.
[09:34.58]Does it matter if I take the thing off?
[09:38.77]Is there a way I can make that slower?
[09:40.09]I feel like it's really erratic.
[09:42.79]It's like holding a compass and spinning around in a circle.
[09:46.95]Move your mouse slightly upwards and... Yeah, upwards.
[09:49.25]See what I mean?
[09:49.69]It's like... I feel like someone's holding a magnet up to my fucking compass.
[09:54.56]Alright.
[09:56.02]So where's the pumpkin right now?
[09:59.92]See what I mean?
[10:01.37]It's kind of... Stab.
[10:02.39]Mouse wheel up.
[10:02.83]Interesting.
[10:16.44]Almost missed the pumpkin.
[10:17.90]Yeah.
[10:20.07]What's that show where they cut shit?
[10:23.37]They make the sword.
[10:24.67]And then they have to cut a bunch of stuff and run around and get winded hitting like meat and chickens and stuff.
[10:31.97]No, not Fruit Ninja.
[10:33.11]It's an actual show on TV.
[10:40.34]Okay, so R to switch weapon mode.
[10:42.30]Why the hell would I hold it like this?
[10:48.14]Hit the dummy on the helmet.
[10:49.94]Why?
[10:50.34]You're not supposed to hold a sword like this.
[10:53.00]Excellent.
[10:53.90]We don't need that dummy anymore.
[10:55.68]Kick it over.
[10:57.66]Rest in peace, Robert.
[11:00.09]Kicks cannot be blocked by a parry.
[11:01.95]Kicks can't be blocked, right?
[11:03.51]That makes sense.
[11:04.67]Forged in fire.
[11:05.53]That's the one.
[11:07.33]You can defend yourself against kicks by performing a kick yourself.
[11:10.45]So you can block a kick with a kick.
[11:12.19]Good block.
[11:12.67]Another.
[11:17.73]I want to rebind that.
[11:18.53]Okay.
[11:18.83]I don't want that as F. Hold on.
[11:19.77]I can't pause it.
[11:20.27]Left mouse button to start, and then just after press Q to faint.
[11:21.89]Alright, okay.
[11:22.21]Press 9 to skip this tutorial stage.
[11:48.22]I get a follow up, but it's okay.
[11:50.56]Sneaky!
[11:51.42]This kind of reminds me of if For Honor was cool.
[12:04.34]Or cooler.
[12:04.54]Morph an attack.
[12:04.92]Okay, you can morph from strike to stab.
[12:06.58]So stab, just press left mouse button to perform a strike, and then quickly mouse wheel up.
[12:11.79]Okay.
[12:11.97]So you can do the same thing in reverse.
[12:13.83]Yep.
[12:37.18]That's enough.
[12:38.00]Cool.
[12:38.58]You can go back and forth.
[12:39.14]I'll show you an advanced maneuver called Chamber and Next.
[12:41.90]Instead of parrying, you can mirror my attacks with your own attack.
[12:45.60]And if you do this just before the attack hits you, it will act as both as a block and a counterattack.
[12:51.46]Alright.
[12:51.84]We have to do it the same direction.
[12:52.74]You must match the point where it's acted successfully, Chamber, or you will perform a left horizontal slash, which you must counter by performing a right horizontal slash just before I hit you.
[13:03.26]Get ready.
[13:04.18]Okay.
[13:04.56]Right horizontal slash.
[13:06.72]Well, I didn't do it right.
[13:10.05]Gotta be quick.
[13:12.63]Wait, what?
[13:17.85]Wait, hold on, wait, wait.
[13:20.81]Perform a right slash right before the weapon reaches you.
[13:32.00]Oh, okay, I get it.
[13:33.44]I thought I was gonna, like, Darth Vader.
[13:37.50]I thought we were going to do the lightsaber connect thing.
[13:40.05]It's right when you get hit.
[13:42.13]It's literally right before it touches you.
[13:43.79]Come here.
[14:24.20]God damn, this is fucking crazy.
[14:29.89]So there's only, you can only parry for a second.
[14:38.95]Uh-oh, died to the instructor.
[14:40.57]Uh-oh, died to the instructor!
[14:44.07]Hey squirts, thanks for the five community subs.
[15:07.31]Hold G to guard.
[15:08.37]Oh, isn't that funny?
[15:11.59]You ain't gonna get me on that one.
[15:12.59]I'm sorry.
[15:13.01]You know, I could... I might be dense, but I'm not thick.
[15:21.91]I have a really heavy brain.
[15:23.75]Not a thick brain.
[15:25.69]Alright, so pick up the bow.
[15:29.31]You kinda have to get out of the way.
[15:34.30]Asshole.
[15:35.18]Supposed to be an instructor.
[15:36.10]Get out of my way.
[15:38.05]Alright, let's get the bow.
[15:38.87]There it is.
[15:39.69]There's my bread and butter.
[15:42.93]Oh, bread and butter.
[15:45.50]He said bread and butter.
[15:46.30]He says that all the time.
[15:50.32]What's the drop like?
[15:51.06]It's not bad.
[15:53.45]Outer circle.
[15:55.13]Outer circle.
[16:02.81]Let's see, how high?
[16:05.47]Is there any drop?
[16:06.93]It's hard to tell.
[16:09.31]Press the left mouse button to start drawing the bow and release when ready to fire.
[16:15.46]If you run out of ammo, you can restock from the ammo box to your left.
[16:18.36]Cool.
[16:22.30]Far outer circle, okay.
[16:28.04]No, so it is a little higher than that.
[16:30.26]Let's see.
[16:31.18]Like up here?
[16:32.80]There it is, yeah.
[16:34.02]It's not, it's really not that much.
[16:35.51]Oh, fuck.
[16:36.61]Ah!
[16:36.75]Too bad.
[16:37.17]Ah!
[16:58.71]No, it's a little bit lower.
[17:00.61]It drops right at the end.
[17:03.83]No, give me an inner circle.
[17:05.53]No, fuck you!
[17:09.55]What separates a true amateur, as you've been able to tell, I have a really dense brain.
[17:13.16]No arrow... What?
[17:30.22]Do I have to shoot this guy?
[17:40.82]Is this the guy screaming, running around a field?
[17:44.47]This guy's harder than an actual video game.
[17:46.31]He's like the ducks.
[17:48.15]I'll get him right here.
[18:00.31]This is actually really hard to hit somebody.
[18:02.25]Splendid shot.
[18:04.61]Don't worry.
[18:05.35]Hans will be just fine.
[18:07.29]He's at worse.
[18:08.53]Follow me.
[18:09.31]I have a surprise for you.
[18:12.23]A surprise?
[18:15.24]Hopefully you're not afraid of horses.
[18:18.28]Pick up that lance.
[18:20.50]How much is there to do in this game?
[18:23.20]The lance is useless on foot, but it is devastating on horseback.
[18:27.31]Now hop onto the horse.
[18:32.62]Oh, Jesus.
[18:36.06]Press F while riding fast to start... Alright, we gotta get F outta here.
[18:41.36]Yeah, we gotta get F the hell outta here.
[18:42.69]Hold on.
[18:44.65]I could've changed that to a mouse button.
[18:48.13]Key bindings.
[18:49.99]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[18:51.19]What's F?
[18:52.05]Kick?
[18:52.99]I want this to be... this button.
[18:55.11]Yeah, whatever.
[18:57.77]Upper right strike, lower right strike.
[18:59.82]I think... Do I need to know?
[19:00.84]Do we need to have this shit?
[19:07.96]Alright, press the mouse button while riding fast to start a crouched attack.
[19:16.02]Okay.
[19:17.70]Hit the dummies.
[19:18.40]Oh, I have to hit the dummies.
[19:19.22]So do I have to hold it or just press it?
[19:28.47]Probably have to hold it.
[19:35.49]Um...
[19:41.23]Uh... What?
[19:48.31]Just get me off the horse, I'll never be on it.
[19:50.21]I'm never gonna use the horse.
[19:54.64]Uh... So you just have to be... Yeah, how fast do you have to be going?
[20:02.12]I have to hold it.
[20:03.64]I'm holding it... Okay, I'm holding it now.
[20:05.02]You know, okay, it'll only last for a certain amount of time.
[20:11.41]You actually have to pull your hand out.
[20:16.17]Like this.
[20:18.93]You don't just have to aim down, you have to like... Don't fall off the horse.
[20:22.01]This isn't Red Dead.
[20:25.92]I gotta turn around.
[20:27.54]I wish I had a more open field for this.
[20:30.12]They're kind of like sticky in the middle here.
[20:36.20]It's hard to control this too.
[20:50.24]Why?
[20:50.60]How is that missing?
[20:53.34]What?
[20:55.70]Oh, get me off this thing.
[20:58.70]Quit horsing around.
[20:59.74]That was funny.
[21:00.45]Come on.
[21:00.89]Give him that one.
[21:03.03]Just don't do that in the game.
[21:19.79]I'm not gonna, because I'm not gonna be a horseback person.
[21:21.97]I'm gonna be a... assassin.
[21:25.71]That's my character.
[21:28.39]And I'm gonna roleplay on Mike the whole time.
[21:30.17]Okay, so you get an axe.
[21:42.49]I mean, what I meant to say is I'm gonna be axe guy.
[21:46.52]Axe guy doesn't go on a horse.
[21:48.42]He runs.
[21:52.76]See?
[21:53.18]That guy doesn't get on the back of the horse.
[21:58.58]Hey!
[21:59.35]What the fuck is that for?
[22:00.95]Alright, I'm gonna be- I'm gonna be meat tenderizer guy.
[22:22.13]Do I have to repair both doors?
[22:25.09]Well, that seems fairly... This probably costs money.
[22:29.09]Longsword.
[22:51.20]Oh, a trebuchet.
[22:52.34]How are you... Mouse wheel down, mouse wheel up to increase the disk?
[22:54.60]Okay, to increase and decrease the power of the shot.
[23:17.19]This is just golf all over again.
[23:18.94]I'm not going to play this either.
[23:19.98]I'm not going to touch this because this is golf.
[23:22.18]And you can see how bad I was at golf.
[23:34.89]Do I... I...
[23:43.64]I got it.
[23:43.88]Okay.
[23:44.00]Crease middle one.
[23:44.54]That one there.
[23:45.20]That's way too far.
[23:46.38]Damn it.
[23:46.64]Do you want me to point blank him in the face with this?
[23:49.38]Can I?
[24:09.60]No, you can't.
[24:11.72]What if I just... Okay, what if I just go closer?
[24:18.89]Hold on.
[24:22.07]Can I just seriously disintegrate his head?
[24:28.53]No, that's not gonna work.
[24:29.62]Just fuck that.
[24:30.32]I'm just gonna go down here.
[24:42.36]Oh, god damn it.
[24:42.92]I just ruined everything.
[24:46.48]I'm stuck.
[24:47.38]He's actually in the way.
[24:51.73]Just back it up.
[24:52.55]I can't move this now.
[24:58.13]There we go.
[24:58.85]Okay, alright, alright.
[24:59.59]Easy, easy, easy.
[25:04.42]Alright, turn.
[25:05.94]Right there's fine.
[25:15.35]How are you supposed to hit this shit?
[25:17.01]I was going to say, if that wasn't it.
[25:27.84]Oh, god damn it.
[25:28.26]First try, get it.
[25:39.14]great yeah you took down the enemy siege tower we were supposed to be in a ceasefire they are going to retaliate get back into the camp soldier and report for duty
[25:51.83]Wait, let me just throw up a rock.
[25:53.09]Alright, so everyone that was asking, well, what the hell happened to Sam and Max?
[25:59.19]And what happened to Dreams?
[26:01.03]Dreams is not something that I can... Okay, here we go.
[26:04.21]Quote start now.
[26:06.08]Dreams is not something that I can make something worth doing and worth streaming in one day.
[26:11.64]I need to go through all the tutorials tutorials and really get the knowledge of the program
[26:16.04]and make something more than one thing over the course of the next four or five days now what does that mean for you I'm going to hold a community event maybe a week from now where we can whoever has dreams can make something with the hashtag Jerma or Jerma in the title and we will watch it all and play through them all in a week that's what's going to happen with dreams
[26:45.99]That's what happened to Dreams.
[26:46.93]That's why it's not here right now.
[26:53.31]A week isn't enough time?
[26:56.01]Well then two weeks, I don't know.
[27:00.37]We'll figure it out.
[27:05.91]Why is this taking so long?
[27:09.87]So there's a Battle Royale mode from my understanding.
[27:17.02]Isn't enough people willing to learn dreams?
[27:19.14]It's hard.
[27:19.90]Wait, didn't I just do this?
[27:27.75]Where's my money?
[27:33.77]Hey, what?
[27:34.75]Why do I have zero dollars?
[27:49.25]Okay, Battle Royale, what should I do?
[27:51.03]Battle VR?
[27:53.29]Europe?
[27:53.59]I think it was West.
[27:57.13]Horde mode, frontline, and Battle Royale.
[27:59.59]This is the first time, okay, let me tell you something.
[28:02.66]This is the first time I have ever played a Battle Royale game on this stream, besides PUBG, like once.
[28:11.96]Okay.
[28:15.66]Let's go for it.
[28:16.22]Do you drop?
[28:17.20]Do we fly in a giant like taxi cab and have it drop us?
[28:26.57]How do we land?
[28:27.37]I don't understand.
[28:40.34]Do we have to pick up items?
[28:45.95]I'm so confused on how this is gonna work.
[28:52.55]Yes, a medieval plane drops you off.
[29:00.76]Yeah, I mean this is a long time ago.
[29:02.18]It's probably one of those little sea planes.
[29:10.79]A dragon?
[29:11.29]Now that would be cool.
[29:16.44]Is there any damage?
[29:25.25]Oh, right in the face!
[29:26.37]That did extra damage.
[29:29.79]Got him.
[29:30.71]See you later.
[29:36.09]I feel like I'm gonna like this battle royale, because it's not... You can't camp with, like, a sniper rifle on the roof.
[29:44.04]You have to go beat the shit out of each other.
[29:54.41]Although it hurts so bad.
[29:57.77]We're just punching a haymaker into stone.
[30:03.57]What is going on?
[30:07.15]They got DC?
[30:08.20]Did I- I DC?
[30:09.46]What the fuck?
[30:17.22]This is gonna be fun.
[30:18.88]Come on.
[30:20.34]Get me in there!
[30:34.05]It's the server?
[30:34.81]Should I join like a different server?
[30:37.75]Should I join like US East or something?
[30:41.52]Come on, get me in there.
[30:44.44]I feel like I'd be very good at this.
[30:45.82]You know what I'm saying?
[30:55.11]I'll try this one more time.
[31:02.92]I could burger boy technique at least half the people that play this game.
[31:09.29]Oh, this used to be a variety stream.
[31:10.97]Now you play Battle Royale like everybody else.
[31:20.01]Matchmaking is all fucked up right now.
[31:21.79]Okay, well, hold on.
[31:28.07]The boomer technique?
[31:29.39]Yeah.
[31:30.96]BR Normie Boomer Streamer.
[31:39.56]It's like, look, look.
[31:43.36]The boomer technique is real.
[31:46.38]You have to press the buttons, as many of them as you can at the same time.
[31:50.37]So you'll go to, you'll fight somebody in the arcade, and you'll make them cry, because you... Well, I mean like in Mortal Kombat, like Arcade Cabinet.
[31:59.86]What I used to do when I was a kid, is there would be these dudes that were older, they were like 10 years older than me, right?
[32:06.94]And this is back when arcade machines had the good console games.
[32:10.12]Because console games weren't good enough back then, right?
[32:12.82]So Mortal Kombat 3 was in the arcade.
[32:15.75]And what I would do is I would go there.
[32:16.75]I was probably like 15.
[32:18.89]No, I was like 12.
[32:19.57]What am I talking about?
[32:20.45]I was playing Mortal Kombat when I was like 12 in the arcade.
[32:23.45]Nobody cared if you did that.
[32:25.91]So anyways, playing Mortal Kombat when I was 12 versus like a 19-year-old.
[32:30.21]You know what I mean?
[32:31.81]And you had the face buttons.
[32:33.19]You had like six of them.
[32:34.29]And you had the joystick.
[32:36.03]And it was a thing back then where people would line up behind whoever was playing.
[32:41.48]And it would be like, okay, when you lose, yeah, now it's my turn to try and take on the champion.
[32:46.40]Because if you won, you didn't have to put more money in.
[32:48.30]You got to stay.
[32:50.10]So what would happen is I would get up there and go up again.
[32:54.65]I would pick Smoke every time in Mortal Kombat 3.
[32:57.13]Cyborg Smoke was the best character ever.
[33:00.41]And then this guy would crack his knuckles like, yeah, this little kid's got nothing on me.
[33:03.93]I've been practicing.
[33:04.88]I've got my own kit.
[33:06.84]He'd get up and he would be doing his little button combos and shit, and I would be going like this.
[33:15.06]Just pressing every single button I could.
[33:17.20]Mashing as hard as I could.
[33:19.04]And I beat them all.
[33:20.64]The guy would get fucking flawless half the time.
[33:22.45]Am I supposed to be playing?
[33:34.37]Necks in line, please!
[33:44.21]How does this work?
[33:48.96]See, there's 17 people left.
[33:56.94]You wanna fight the fucking 12-year-old?!
[34:05.42]Oh, it's a real fancy fucking kit you got there.
[34:08.31]Too bad you didn't think you were going up against smoke.
[34:21.00]items oh shit he's got what does he got a leg he doesn't even know well this guy's good uh-oh he's got kabal
[34:49.54]I'm standing in a fucking fire.
[35:05.17]Why can I... Why are we all so dumb?
[35:10.93]Oh, I gotta right the teeth.
[35:18.50]Oh, you didn't think I was going to come at you like that, did you?
[35:21.96]Oh, give me that.
[35:22.42]What's that?
[35:23.58]Give me his helmet, too.
[35:25.12]Oh, shit.
[35:29.64]I'm going to get the presents.
[35:30.76]Hold on.
[35:31.08]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[35:31.64]There's a lot of stuff on the ground.
[35:32.56]How do I go in my inventory?
[35:36.28]I don't know how to go in my inventory.
[35:38.13]Long sword, rusty shovel.
[35:39.79]No, I don't want to use the rusty shovel.
[35:44.49]Maybe I do.
[35:48.83]What else do I have?
[35:49.43]Okay, here's the poleaxe.
[36:00.62]This is too nerve-wracking.
[36:06.89]How big is the area?
[36:09.37]There's the guy right there, but I'm gonna shovel the fuck out of this guy.
[36:12.01]I just broke all my legs.
[36:13.95]Is there a heal?
[36:14.63]Am I healing over time?
[36:15.63]I don't understand.
[36:18.30]Oh my god, I'm gonna shovel this guy.
[36:29.73]What's that?
[36:30.75]What's that?
[36:40.46]Just kidding.
[36:52.21]Ooh!
[37:00.10]Where's he going?
[37:02.08]Someone's gotta come from behind me, I know it.
[37:07.40]Eat berries?
[37:08.20]Is that what you do?
[37:15.23]Oh shit, I almost had it.
[37:31.55]I don't know what to do.
[37:34.82]How do I heal?
[37:37.48]Give me the poleaxe.
[37:38.26]What's this?
[37:38.96]What the?
[37:39.32]What?
[37:40.22]What?
[37:40.46]What?
[37:40.68]What?
[37:40.94]What?
[37:41.26]What?
[37:41.96]What is that?
[37:42.56]What did I die instantly for?
[37:43.78]What?
[37:43.92]Was that out of bounds?
[37:48.48]What?
[37:53.39]That's the circle?
[37:55.03]Oh, there's a circle.
[37:56.35]I thought it ticked damage on you.
[38:03.80]Because I don't play Battle Royales.
[38:05.62]I've played a Battle Royale like twice.
[38:07.34]Oh, I can't believe he's not one of these streamers that plays Battle Royale every day.
[38:13.98]What?
[38:16.84]I can't believe you didn't know that that was the circle.
[38:19.44]I mean, this guy streams Battle Royales 5,000 hours.
[38:22.92]I can't believe you didn't know.
[38:24.94]I didn't know?
[38:33.41]It was just gray.
[38:35.25]I thought it was like gonna battlefield me and turn me around.
[38:39.51]You know when it goes like, please get back to the playing field in five seconds.
[38:54.90]Hey, Etalyx, I did really well.
[38:58.02]I was killing people.
[38:59.04]I just fucking walked out of the circle and died instantly.
[39:03.19]I'm calling him.
[39:04.25]He needs to know.
[39:14.72]I'm calling him right now.
[39:18.26]Yo.
[39:19.02]Hey.
[39:20.60]The Battle Royale circle thing instantly killed me.
[39:23.01]I was doing well.
[39:23.99]I was in the last six.
[39:26.50]Did you get chased and you got caught in the circle?
[39:30.86]I cowered it out and I ran away, but then I stepped out of the circle for a second.
[39:34.28]It was just like somebody hit me in the head with a rock and I instantly died.
[39:36.90]I don't play Battle Royales.
[39:42.69]Hold on, so you strolled casually into the fog?
[39:46.27]Is that what happened?
[39:47.87]And instantly died?
[39:49.17]I was doing so good too.
[39:50.29]Alright, how do I add you?
[39:54.84]Can you queue as two for Battle Royale?
[40:01.66]There's a party system.
[40:02.70]Let's see.
[40:03.52]Oops.
[40:04.88]Party.
[40:05.76]Home.
[40:06.77]Am I logged in?
[40:08.41]Probably not.
[40:08.91]Alright, maybe I can see you.
[40:11.81]Are you in the game?
[40:13.25]Oh, there we go.
[40:13.77]I think I can just add you.
[40:17.69]What's your name?
[40:20.36]Stixon.
[40:21.60]Stixon.
[40:23.34]Alright, there you go.
[40:24.38]Did you get it?
[40:27.66]You should have got it, right?
[40:31.24]Uh, yes, but... I don't see you in the party list here.
[40:38.23]Yeah, it just, it said I got an invite, but it's not actually like an accept invitation button.
[40:45.49]Hmm.
[40:46.03]Can you join off me?
[40:48.60]It doesn't even say that you're playing Mordhau.
[40:52.18]What?
[40:52.72]What?
[40:54.44]Can I join you?
[41:01.31]When's this game coming out to the Epic Games Store?
[41:02.91]Just wondering.
[41:03.87]What?
[41:04.49]What?
[41:06.42]Hold on.
[41:06.88]Can I leave party?
[41:07.88]No, I don't think I can.
[41:11.70]Yeah, I'm online.
[41:12.34]I'm appearing online.
[41:13.54]Should be.
[41:19.32]Invites do not work.
[41:21.11]Oh.
[41:22.11]Well.
[41:25.39]Invites don't work.
[41:27.99]So, like, if I invite you, what does it say?
[41:29.89]It says you invited me to play a hit play game and I can't join you.
[41:33.81]I just probably pressed it.
[41:35.42]So, we can't play together.
[41:37.26]Is that what you guys are saying?
[41:40.60]We have to find a server browser and join the same server.
[41:45.48]Oh.
[41:46.34]That's minus a full letter grade, I think, right off the bat.
[41:50.53]Yeah, but that means that people can, like, come get us, isn't it?
[41:52.63]Because they'll know what server we're in.
[41:55.63]Isn't that, like, isn't that the streamer thing?
[41:57.35]We put on, like, a three-minute delay and put a fake name on?
[42:03.19]Hold on.
[42:03.59]Server browser.
[42:10.47]Rent a server is down here.
[42:11.85]Alright.
[42:12.51]Server browser.
[42:13.57]Are you getting anything in the server browser?
[42:20.98]I'm not getting anything in the server browser.
[42:25.62]The rent-a-server button works.
[42:27.55]You want to buy a server.
[42:32.33]Okay, how do we... Not full.
[42:37.77]Has players and no password.
[42:39.97]Are there official servers yet?
[42:49.35]Game mode.
[42:49.95]We should probably just do deathmatch, right?
[42:57.30]Yeah, I hit refresh.
[42:58.04]Let's see.
[42:58.42]There you guys can see.
[43:01.72]See, I'm kind of just sitting here.
[43:03.02]Oh, there we go.
[43:04.58]Real question.
[43:05.18]Is this game early access?
[43:07.78]I don't know.
[43:08.46]Is it?
[43:14.47]This is official deathmatch Los Angeles.
[43:17.29]With only one slot, though.
[43:23.48]uh alright so these mean that they're official servers alright I'm gonna okay I'm gonna I'm gonna mute everything and I'm gonna tell you this browser works now yeah I can see it now well it don't it don't even matter people it doesn't matter what server people know we're going because there's only 16 people allowed anyways there's only like five that we're going to be able to choose from in the first place
[43:50.91]Alright, so we're going to... Whatever, it don't matter.
[43:55.47]We're going to... Can you just sort by name?
[43:57.19]Or do I have to... Yeah, sort by ping.
[44:02.09]I can't click any of the sort buttons.
[44:04.09]No.
[44:06.73]Well, let's just... Well, it was fun playing with you.
[44:12.73]Yeah, that was a really good co-op experience.
[44:15.03]Glad you, like, asked me to play the Charlie.
[44:16.75]Let's go!
[44:18.70]Uh, there's... Did you see this one?
[44:21.10]Did you see the official US West number 8?
[44:24.74]I mean, there's nobody in there, though.
[44:28.12]There will be.
[44:29.00]There's... Okay, official Dallas.
[44:30.24]I'm gonna find it before I can.
[44:31.56]Do you see Dallas?
[44:33.91]Official deathmatch Dallas?
[44:40.83]There should be spots in there.
[44:42.99]We don't have the greatest ping, but, you know.
[44:45.59]Well, what's the... What's the ping?
[44:48.54]It's like 100.
[44:54.08]Official team deathmatch, Dallas?
[44:55.86]Official deathmatch, Dallas.
[45:02.01]Is this going to be full?
[45:04.13]No, it won't.
[45:04.65]Nobody's playing right now.
[45:14.15]Alright, I'm going to give this like 30 more seconds.
[45:15.83]And then I'm just going to join a random server.
[45:19.12]Yeah, that one's open.
[45:22.28]Is it official deathmatch Dallas Despina 4?
[45:26.06]Hyrokin.
[45:28.76]Quick up.
[45:30.60]I'm not going to be able to find it.
[45:34.17]There's no way to search.
[45:36.49]We're on the same internet, so we have the same ping.
[45:38.65]You should be able to tell me an exact ping for something.
[45:40.73]Do you see the one with 65 ping?
[45:41.41]Los Angeles.
[45:41.79]Los Angeles.
[45:51.95]Official death math law changes.
[45:53.18]Phoebe, five.
[46:03.80]Okay, 65.
[46:05.90]Phoebe.
[46:06.40]I see, which one?
[46:08.95]Los Angeles, Phoebe.
[46:11.49]I see Los Angeles, the mirror.
[46:13.11]Los Angeles, the Lhasa.
[46:16.33]Los Angeles, the close seat.
[46:20.52]Alright, well, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna play.
[46:23.50]Yeah, I don't blame you.
[46:24.62]It's not anyone's fault except the game that the matchmaking doesn't work.
[46:29.08]How do we not see the same one?
[46:33.10]How do we not see the same one?
[46:34.36]It's with this video game.
[46:37.45]Thalassa, did you see Dallas Thalassa?
[46:41.27]Yeah.
[46:42.47]Go, click it, quick.
[46:49.76]No, it's full.
[46:53.80]It had, like, a few spots.
[46:54.95]Alright, we'll just, um... Alright, I'm gonna mute everything, and we're just gonna talk.
[46:59.91]Ready?
[47:01.59]Hold on, let me mute you.
[47:02.57]Here.
[47:04.29]Alright, hold on, we're gonna get this figured out.
[48:36.24]Alright, now I couldn't get the Surfer Browser to come back, so we're gonna just... We're just gonna queue up!
[48:47.75]The Surfer Browser wouldn't come back.
[48:51.84]Let's try it again!
[48:53.78]So, Etalyx is no longer with us.
[48:58.62]We will try again later.
[49:10.15]Because, like, this seems to work, but we can't see the same servers.
[49:14.31]And when we try to join them, when I last tried to do that, I got errors.
[49:19.85]It was like, error, could not join.
[49:21.46]And I was just trying to refresh the list.
[49:22.84]I would sit there for like 20 seconds and it wouldn't do anything.
[49:28.04]Should have set this up before the stream?
[49:29.86]I did.
[49:30.14]I mean, I don't know if the servers are going to have problems right now, right this second.
[49:33.89]How am I supposed to know that?
[49:47.92]What's the default FOV?
[49:49.50]Let's find out.
[49:55.70]I have it at 90.
[49:57.07]Should it be more?
[50:01.47]This is not going to count for points, right?
[50:03.03]Should I do 100?
[50:05.17]100 might make me puke.
[50:06.51]No, 95 is fine.
[50:11.72]Yeah, this is already... If I go more than this, I'll have a problem.
[50:22.28]Yeah, when FOV is too high, it actually kind of sucks.
[50:26.07]Because every time you turn, it's almost like you're looking through a telescope.
[50:41.08]Sub 180.
[50:41.86]How many players are here?
[50:48.65]High ping and packet loss.
[50:50.67]Uh oh.
[50:52.67]Uh oh.
[50:56.40]We may have hit the wall of playing a new game on the internet.
[51:01.42]How new is this?
[51:03.52]Didn't this come out like a week or two ago?
[51:05.34]When did it come out?
[51:08.96]Yesterday?
[51:11.18]I forgot.
[51:12.70]God damn it, I forgot!
[51:14.70]Any video game that releases for the first three days doesn't work.
[51:17.90]I forgot!
[51:18.88]God damn it!
[51:35.22]My mistake.
[51:42.53]You gotta wait for the first, like, week and a half to go by for them to patch the game three times.
[51:47.62]And then you can play the game.
[52:02.31]Alright, I think we're starting.
[52:12.57]You know what game companies should really do?
[52:14.05]And maybe they do this, but who knows.
[52:18.60]Do people do this?
[52:20.00]Let me ask a question.
[52:21.88]So if you had a video game that was releasing, why wouldn't you just rent like an absolute shitload of servers?
[52:28.98]Like too many.
[52:29.86]Like a joke amount.
[52:31.12]For like five days.
[52:32.10]And then just turn them all off.
[52:37.50]Just rent like an absolute dumb amount of servers for a month.
[52:40.16]And then just turn them off.
[52:44.71]And then reduce it down to, like, the amount that you want.
[52:55.15]Alright, here we go.
[52:57.53]That costs money, though.
[53:01.58]Yeah, I know.
[53:02.08]This is not just, like, an independent studio thing.
[53:05.66]This happens with, like... This happened with, like, Anthem, too, didn't it?
[53:09.94]I might be making that up.
[53:13.09]Even AAA studios have the same problem.
[53:14.85]Alright, I'm gonna... This guy's fucking dead.
[53:23.48]No.
[53:24.42]I'm just saying a triple... Alright, I'm gonna kill this guy with my bare hands.
[53:27.34]No, I'm not.
[53:27.74]I'm gonna run away.
[53:28.90]I'm just gonna break my legs.
[53:41.03]Shit!
[53:41.27]No!
[53:41.33]I don't have to- I don't have to breathe Q now!
[53:43.70]God dammit!
[53:45.92]No!
[53:46.28]What was I- Ah!
[53:47.66]I'm so fucking mad!
[53:49.00]I just wanna play!
[54:11.04]Alright, I'm gonna pick the other game mode then.
[54:15.40]Use the server browser?
[54:16.35]I just tried and I got errors trying to use the browser!
[54:19.33]This is a pretty good menu stream so far.
[54:47.29]Breathe, Arnold.
[54:54.58]So I guess just don't queue for BR.
[55:04.58]Oh my god.
[55:20.47]You gotta talk to chat about Sam and Max.
[55:25.63]Yeah, I'm gonna finish it, don't worry.
[55:28.29]This is a fun game, though.
[55:29.83]Fuck!
[55:40.62]Okay, come on.
[55:41.60]Show me something.
[55:49.18]God, okay.
[55:50.14]I don't even care what it is.
[55:51.20]Just let me play.
[55:54.18]Right?
[55:54.46]Okay, don't give me an error.
[55:55.80]It gave me an error last time.
[55:56.86]Oh my god, it's not full.
[56:00.97]Oh my, I can't believe it.
[56:08.01]Let's go.
[56:19.56]Huntsman.
[56:27.98]Now, don't die immediately.
[56:29.57]I got a cleaver, too?
[56:36.09]This is actually... This is exactly what I'd want as a weapon if I was in a medieval time.
[56:39.07]Alright, so wait, they're coming in through here?
[56:49.14]Is that a Magician?
[56:50.48]I get that guy right in the head.
[56:51.92]No, I'm kidding!
[56:58.95]Give me my Cleaver.
[57:08.23]So, are we defending a point, or is it just Team Deathmatch?
[57:13.57]Is it Friendly Fire?
[57:15.82]Ooh, see ya!
[57:21.76]Oops.
[57:22.72]No, there's no friendly fire.
[57:30.98]Oh, shit.
[57:31.46]Oh, wait!
[57:32.00]They have archers on the other team.
[57:38.69]I'm going up.
[57:48.83]Help this guy out.
[57:56.60]Oops.
[57:58.54]Do they have any arches up?
[57:59.88]Right there.
[58:02.66]Oh, shit!
[58:08.73]This guy's wildly swinging.
[58:10.13]I don't have any mo- My bow is gone.
[58:18.20]Did he knock the bow out of my hands?
[58:23.52]Somebody said that guy's the headless ape swinging.
[58:27.11]Oh shit.
[58:42.91]I can do better than that.
[58:47.71]Crazy man with cleaver charges into battle.
[58:54.40]Guy's almost dead.
[59:06.91]We're getting overrun.
[59:07.63]I hit my teammate right in the head.
[59:16.45]I'm going in.
[59:22.12]No, get up here.
[59:34.92]Almost.
[59:41.49]I helped that dude out.
[59:42.25]The guy crossed the way here.
[59:43.59]Right there.
[59:43.95]Right in the head.
[59:44.51]Bang.
[59:45.59]God damn it.
[59:46.03]He moved.
[59:52.46]The archer is so much fun.
[60:01.20]Okay, I'm gonna try something else.
[60:03.52]How about Knight?
[60:04.50]This is just standard battle.
[60:18.87]Stream sniped!
[60:20.73]See?
[60:21.35]I told you!
[60:23.57]Why'd you hit me?
[60:24.37]Are you stream sniping me?
[60:26.23]That guy just stream sniped me!
[60:27.55]And he's on my own team.
[60:29.72]See?
[60:29.94]Look, this guy's stream sniping!
[60:32.42]I'm gonna fucking kill the stream sniper, watch this.
[60:34.90]Oh, look at you!
[60:35.79]Oh, you got the stream open?!
[60:39.43]Ow!
[60:44.05]No!
[60:44.75]It's another stream sniper!
[60:54.64]Another stream sniper.
[61:01.04]Welcome to VR.
[61:03.32]Well, this isn't VR.
[61:04.16]This is just dick and rum.
[61:07.22]Here we go, one-on-one.
[61:14.72]Don't hit me from... Oh, look, another stream sniper, huh?
[61:29.10]You can't just run in there swinging and hitting walls, man.
[61:31.48]Oh my god.
[61:39.57]Shit, I got too many people there.
[61:47.84]Dude, imagine that's how you die.
[61:49.98]You'd probably still be alive for a second, right?
[61:54.86]No, I don't think you would.
[61:58.57]New class?
[61:59.03]No, no, no, hold on.
[61:59.83]Not yet, not yet.
[62:00.75]Not quite.
[62:07.00]Watch out.
[62:16.86]Shit.
[62:18.58]Where'd he go?
[62:22.67]Is there a way to heal?
[62:31.08]Oh, fuck!
[62:34.54]He just ducked under it!
[62:35.50]This is fucking fun.
[62:44.93]You passively regen when you don't use stamina.
[62:46.77]Okay.
[62:50.67]This is like a combination of Chivalry and For Honor.
[62:56.78]This is fucking fun.
[62:57.60]This is actually a lot of fun.
[63:00.02]I'm glad I get to play it.
[63:00.92]I gotta do some more techniques here, man.
[63:05.52]Like, for instance, this stream sniper over here.
[63:10.86]Which one of these stream snipers should I go after?
[63:12.50]This guy right here.
[63:13.06]Fuck.
[63:25.12]It's not that long.
[63:30.00]God damn it.
[63:33.04]It's actually kind of hard to hit somebody in the back.
[63:39.27]If they're running.
[63:40.45]Because you have to take this time to swing.
[63:42.17]That guy had a smaller weapon.
[63:46.05]Where did I just go?
[63:49.74]He was doing it to me.
[63:50.50]Yeah, because he had like a little knife.
[63:52.52]Alright, I'm going to make up for it right now.
[63:53.70]I'm taking this guy's head off.
[64:07.95]Oh, that wasn't a parry?
[64:14.17]Somebody's behind me too.
[64:14.99]Fuck.
[64:16.03]Not good.
[64:16.53]Let's try Raider.
[64:25.62]This guy's got a huge axe.
[64:29.29]Alright, I'm not going to run in this time.
[64:30.61]I'm going to stay back.
[64:34.29]It's too fun just to try to go and take somebody's head off, though.
[64:39.80]That guy just threw an axe at me?
[64:42.50]That guy's throwing weapons.
[64:43.58]That guy's throwing maces and shit?
[64:55.31]Alright, I'll take care of this.
[65:09.41]Nice.
[65:10.11]Good job.
[65:10.99]This guy ain't not paying attention.
[65:12.23]Not paying attention.
[65:13.05]Free head.
[65:14.03]Free head!
[65:17.13]Damn it.
[65:17.95]Wasn't enough damage.
[65:18.65]Fuck!
[65:23.44]No!
[65:23.86]I have throwing axes, do I?
[65:29.72]Oh, shit, I do.
[65:32.78]Okay.
[65:48.55]What just hit me?
[65:50.71]Why did I just fall back?
[65:55.79]I just fell down.
[65:56.67]I just tripped.
[65:57.89]You coming down here?
[65:58.57]Alright, fine.
[66:00.61]I'll come up there to you.
[66:03.65]You gonna be dishonorable or you gonna let me up?
[66:06.33]Fine, I'll put the axe away.
[66:08.71]Let's go.
[66:18.10]Is it?
[66:19.04]Oh, no, no, there's another guy.
[66:27.09]Get him!
[66:27.58]Get him!
[66:28.58]Get him!
[66:29.44]I'm distracting him!
[66:30.24]Get him!
[66:49.46]I just... Hey!
[66:51.37]Who did that?
[66:53.07]I just got sniped.
[66:54.10]Like, there's an actual sniper rifle up there in the kill feed.
[67:15.06]I love this.
[67:15.58]This is so fun.
[67:17.09]Oh, man.
[67:17.47]Alright, first time ever getting to really play.
[67:21.17]That was awesome.
[67:31.02]Reminds me of Fistful of Frags.
[67:32.48]It does.
[67:36.18]It really does.
[67:41.00]It's like Fistful of Frags for honor and chivalry.
[67:46.75]It does have that Fistful of Frags feel.
[67:49.57]You're right.
[67:49.95]Let's stay on the same team.
[67:55.59]Why not?
[67:57.59]What about Protector?
[67:59.33]So I'm like the shield.
[68:01.23]I have to stay out in front of everybody, right?
[68:03.41]Smoke Bomb.
[68:09.52]This is Dark Soul.
[68:10.50]The Dark Souls guy, yeah.
[68:15.08]Let's go.
[68:17.80]I will be your shield.
[68:21.07]And my bow.
[68:23.07]And my axe!
[68:26.43]Why is there not voice chat?
[68:27.35]I wanna have people scream memes in my face.
[68:29.31]Um... Speaking of people screaming memes in my face...
[68:39.81]What is that sound?
[68:42.62]Oops, no longer the shield.
[68:49.58]Oh, sorry!
[68:50.16]Okay, this guy is just like Saitama.
[68:59.97]Why is he winning?
[69:03.15]It shouldn't be happening right now.
[69:14.62]Damn it.
[69:16.32]Got him.
[69:22.92]Alright, alright, alright.
[69:23.96]Ooh, alright.
[69:24.88]Who is it?
[69:25.22]Eat shit.
[69:31.38]Did I just kill somebody?
[69:32.56]I think I just killed somebody with a firework.
[69:35.09]That was a bad idea.
[69:36.03]Oh, no.
[69:39.53]Was that a bad guy?
[69:40.87]I couldn't tell in the smoke.
[69:47.14]I just- I just Steven- I just Steven King'd that guy.
[69:52.12]They made a movie about what I just did.
[70:06.19]Hitting somebody right in the face.
[70:07.48]Let's do it again.
[70:08.44]No, I don't have any more.
[70:20.20]No way!
[70:21.16]Somebody kill this fucking guy with the frying pan!
[70:28.33]Stop playing the guitar!
[70:30.07]Alright, that's the only death I've had the whole time.
[70:42.16]Let's go.
[70:45.10]Oh, it's you doing that.
[70:49.28]I don't feel bad about that.
[70:50.34]Am I gonna get banned for what I'm doing?
[70:52.64]Look, he's clearly being a nuisance, okay?
[70:55.17]Clearly being a nuisance.
[70:57.75]I don't get points taken down for that.
[70:58.93]The guy was a nuisance.
[71:09.94]Let me go in front.
[71:11.10]Let me get in front.
[71:17.35]Damn it.
[71:34.77]I don't know, okay.
[71:39.16]I look like such an idiot right now.
[71:53.71]Ah, come here.
[71:55.35]Damn it!
[71:59.72]Alright, I'm going to change class.
[72:02.70]What does Brig end?
[72:04.77]Footman?
[72:06.01]Scoundrel?
[72:07.59]Engineer?
[72:08.13]I'm going with Veteran.
[72:21.72]He's taunting?
[72:22.22]Alright.
[72:24.62]Yeah, I was going to say, that's not a good idea for you to taunt right there.
[72:32.45]See ya.
[72:33.33]I'm going for an overhead smash right in this guy's head.
[72:51.83]Damn!
[72:52.27]Too many!
[72:52.71]Too many!
[72:53.11]Too many!
[72:53.53]Too many!
[72:53.99]Too many!
[72:55.73]Too many!
[72:56.25]Too many!
[72:56.77]Too many!
[73:03.20]Here we go.
[73:03.60]What does he get?
[73:04.06]So he's got Evening Star.
[73:07.44]This thing is huge.
[73:18.76]Wow, that does a lot.
[73:22.35]It's brutal.
[73:34.18]Oops, sorry.
[73:41.63]Oh shit.
[73:41.99]Fuck.
[73:55.71]Oh, he fucking just baited me so hard.
[73:57.45]I thought he turned around and ran.
[74:02.48]I thought he was... I looked like he was turning around to run.
[74:16.22]Look at the big chunk missing.
[74:21.24]Watch out.
[74:22.04]Naked guy.
[74:23.78]Naked guy with the pan!
[74:26.53]Oh, this is bad.
[74:30.09]This is really bad.
[74:37.77]Oh fuck, nope.
[74:43.84]Dude, I always have to get like, it's always like a 4v4v.
[74:45.80]Aw, team stack, scramble the teams!
[74:51.78]Scramble the teams!
[74:57.67]Oh, you idiot!
[75:20.20]Oh god.
[75:20.72]I'm team killing.
[75:23.89]So is he!
[75:25.45]He's arguably killing more teammates than I am!
[75:27.77]What do you mean no?
[75:39.72]He's like standing in the way and- Oh my fucking god.
[75:51.40]I'm gonna go to, uh, I'm gonna go to... Let's go Hauntzman again.
[76:08.03]Oh.
[76:15.40]Damn it.
[76:19.42]You're not gonna teabag me in my own stream?
[76:30.40]Fuck, he did.
[76:41.05]The loot gives health?
[76:42.53]Oh, I thought he was just like doing a taunt like command.
[77:01.97]A little chip damage, not a big deal.
[77:03.66]Uh-oh, here they all come again.
[77:09.54]Watch out!
[77:10.12]Watch out!
[77:10.72]Watch out!
[77:11.94]Pick up your sword!
[77:12.94]Okay, good.
[77:32.69]Oh, that didn't get him in the head?
[77:43.60]Get out of here!
[77:59.73]I get it.
[78:00.05]Right here, right in the head.
[78:02.13]Dammit.
[78:02.55]Almost.
[78:03.01]Oh boy.
[78:03.45]Oh boy.
[78:03.67]I gotta make this shot count.
[78:04.51]Shot's gotta count.
[78:05.61]Didn't count.
[78:11.71]Get!
[78:21.36]Dammit.
[78:25.74]What is he doing?
[78:31.67]Oh, he's just stream sniping.
[78:34.01]That's what he's doing.
[78:34.63]Did he block that?
[78:40.45]He's blocking the arrows.
[78:41.69]Damn it.
[79:01.75]Did that not hit him?
[79:02.83]Sounded like it hit him.
[79:11.57]Damn it!
[79:12.01]I thought the guy was still next to me.
[79:17.08]I want to go... I don't know.
[79:23.78]I haven't done this yet.
[79:27.48]You definitely want to do a lot of stabs with this.
[79:38.41]Don't get baited out, they're trying to bait us.
[79:48.56]Alright, this guy too.
[79:53.72]Ooh, that's a lot of reach.
[79:56.46]This thing is nice.
[80:00.53]Shit, watch out for this guy.
[80:11.35]Oh, come on.
[80:21.70]Spears are the best weapons?
[80:23.54]Oh, medic bag.
[80:24.40]Do I have to touch people with this, or do they just get healed if I'm near them?
[80:30.08]How'd you get the scythe?
[80:34.94]Just drop it over here.
[80:41.64]I only get one.
[80:42.30]Alright, so it's just behind here?
[80:45.22]Well, I thought they were going to be fighting here.
[80:51.72]This way, Doctor.
[80:54.06]Kind of.
[81:01.14]You can buy weapons and customize a character.
[81:03.50]Really?
[81:05.58]That's actually really awesome.
[81:10.54]Nice, that was a good backswing.
[81:17.53]Ooh.
[81:26.44]Good job.
[81:39.26]Why is the guy with the pants so good?
[81:40.86]Oh fuck, there's somebody here.
[81:55.03]So it's currently bugged right now?
[81:56.33]That's not good, I see.
[82:04.31]Mmm, parry.
[82:09.46]Aw, dammit, what?
[82:10.70]What?
[82:12.60]How did I not... Uh, I don't like it.
[82:18.47]Who have I not... What item have I not used?

[83:28.27]Oh, we win.
[83:37.34]Hiya!
[83:43.62]64 person server?
[83:48.13]Should I try to get in the 60s?
[83:49.01]That would be absolute chaos.
[83:52.45]Alright, I'll go for it.
[84:01.36]Server browser.
[84:08.90]That's not quit game?
[84:09.82]That's a...
[84:14.44]That's a quit game.
[84:15.98]Does that take me to the menu?
[84:17.38]Or does it quit out?
[84:18.75]Okay.
[84:19.19]Some of these games just boot you out to the... They take you out of the whole game.
[84:26.05]I'll try, like, a huge one.
[84:36.26]You gonna regret that?
[84:37.26]Probably, but it's all good.
[84:44.86]Customized gear.
[84:45.70]I don't think I can, right?
[84:46.72]It's messed up.
[84:49.20]Isn't it broken?
[84:53.18]I don't have any money.
[84:54.16]I'm not even getting currency.
[85:03.63]New mercenary.
[85:09.17]Zuiyan.
[85:09.53]Head.
[85:11.39]Head.
[85:15.77]I'll put peasant hair on.
[85:16.85]That sounds good.
[85:20.09]Uh, torso.
[85:23.15]No, that's too easy.
[85:24.23]This one.
[85:24.75]Peasant shirt.
[85:25.31]I'm just gonna be a peasant.
[85:31.93]I'm just gonna be really unassuming.
[85:36.07]Okay, legs, workers, shorts, pants.
[85:41.51]That's fine.
[85:43.13]Alright, gear.
[85:43.87]Equipment.
[85:47.87]Oh.
[85:48.42]Costs a point.
[85:50.70]Yeah, I can't do any of this.
[85:54.28]I'm not getting any currency.
[85:55.76]Yeah, customization does not work right now.
[86:01.70]Okay, well that's alright.
[86:07.01]That's all good.
[86:08.91]I had 15?
[86:09.33]I thought that I couldn't do it.
[86:12.27]Everyone just said it was downed.
[86:30.56]Like, for instance, okay, like, dagger, right?
[86:35.18]Yeah, progression doesn't work.
[86:42.41]Oh, goddammit.
[86:46.49]Did I just spend those, or can I... Okay, wait, wait, okay, wait, wait.
[86:52.17]Peasant.
[86:54.63]Okay, why would that be a perk?
[86:57.05]What does that do?
[87:00.60]Crouch movement speed.
[87:01.96]Cat.
[87:07.78]Friendly.
[87:08.28]I like that one.
[87:12.69]Ranger.
[87:15.31]Scavenger.
[87:19.23]Dodge.
[87:20.85]That's actually really good.
[87:22.11]Brawler.
[87:22.57]Might as well just... Uh... Wreck structures repairer.
[87:31.55]and bows crossbows and throwables deal more damage against enemies carrying a quiver stamina on kill increased by that's good and we'll do fists why not peasant does not do anything well why would it be eight points
[87:52.63]Gain full health on a melee kill.
[87:54.35]Yeah, why would I not just select this?
[87:57.21]And then... Like, Fury.
[88:01.16]And... Instantly start sprinting upon killing an enemy.
[88:08.16]Gain three extra stamina on hit.
[88:10.18]That's good.
[88:12.62]Friendly fire reduction.
[88:16.85]Fine, I'll do Rat.
[88:19.11]Just because I have to.
[88:21.55]And then, fatal melee and projectile damage except for headshot does not kill you immediately.
[88:26.94]Sure, why not?
[88:27.84]And then, that's it.
[88:30.58]Okay.
[88:32.80]So that's it.
[88:34.08]But he doesn't have any items.
[88:37.87]What does he have?
[88:38.33]He doesn't have anything.
[88:40.45]He has no equipment.
[88:43.45]I can't unlock this.
[88:45.75]None of these can be used.
[88:48.35]He's just gonna be fists.
[88:50.85]Well, then I have to... Well, then I have to take that off and go like that.
[88:57.71]Alright, that's fine.
[88:59.74]I'm ready to go.
[89:03.60]So we're looking for a high... I get 64... 48... Let's... Okay.
[89:09.44]Let's do... 48 first.
[89:11.28]You know what I'm saying?
[89:13.78]I'm not gonna do 64.
[89:15.86]Right off the bat.
[89:26.29]Alright, this one.
[89:31.31]There's a lot of people here.
[89:32.41]I have to choose my spawn point.
[89:38.00]Oh dear.
[89:39.96]Capture the enemy flags.
[89:54.64]What?
[89:56.98]Probably looked so funny on their screen That's why he's called this way ender for this exact purpose I
[90:25.98]What does he got?

[94:10.21]We weren't standing in the capture point?
[94:16.47]Oh, reinforcements, okay.
[94:22.98]I'm never gonna rank up.

[94:37.19]I wanna, like, get better.
[94:38.43]I gotta, like, practice and get better.
[94:45.87]I want to do the other game modes too.
[94:47.90]Alright, I've played with everybody except the Engineer.
[94:52.06]So what does the Engineer do?
[95:00.47]Toolbox, Loot, Blacksmith, Hammer.
[95:06.42]So I can do this now.
[95:12.09]Loot.
[95:13.45]The hammer fixes the walls.
[95:15.89]What does this do?
[95:18.55]I put down walls for people to hide behind?
[95:20.63]I guess.
[95:29.50]Oh, I can put down spikes, too.
[95:31.68]Alright, well, here we go.
[95:35.06]Put the spikes down right here.
[95:36.01]Um...

[95:59.08]Alright, see?
[96:06.05]We got like a strategic location here now.
[96:22.08]Come here, come here with that horse!
[96:30.34]Awww, I could have had a chance there with the hammer.
[96:36.02]Get back here!
[96:36.76]This is healing people, right?
[96:56.28]Oh, look at this.
[96:57.32]The internet is having problems.
[97:04.62]I thought I could really take him off.
[97:06.53]I'm gonna get him right here.
[97:08.45]He doesn't know I'm chasing after him.
[97:10.25]I mean, it doesn't really matter.
[97:11.51]It doesn't matter.
[97:11.99]I'll get him right here.
[97:16.21]What does this do?
[97:23.15]Repairing?
[97:23.77]I don't even know what I repaired.
[97:29.82]What is the loot?
[97:31.04]The mandala?
[97:31.70]It's, uh... I don't know.
[97:36.70]I think it heals.
[97:40.77]Build a stables.
[97:42.01]Do I have to do that?
[97:52.51]Oh, fuck.
[97:52.97]Hold on.
[98:00.94]This is a bad guy, right?
[98:02.18]It is an enemy.
[98:06.34]Kill him with the... Get him.
[98:09.30]Kill him!
[98:10.30]He's kicked.
[98:11.14]You can't let him get away.
[98:12.10]Oh!
[98:24.31]Oh, god damn it!
[98:25.41]I'm not even paying attention!
[98:31.81]I hit him off the horse.
[98:32.99]Oh, what the fuck?
[98:34.75]I don't want to be this guy anymore.
[98:36.07]I feel like I don't know enough about the game to be useful.
[98:41.05]We'll go back to Raider.
[98:45.68]Look, I'm gonna help a little bit here.
[98:49.82]The Horde!
[98:51.28]The Horde has been blown!
[98:59.45]Whatever.
[99:00.01]Just give me... I want to be the raider.
[99:07.69]He's helping.
[99:09.01]Not really.
[99:10.69]Now I'm going to help.
[99:11.41]Watch this.
[99:12.69]If I don't get at least three kills here, and clean, not assists, me get the kill, then bye-bye Twitch channel.
[99:34.92]That was mine.
[99:41.10]Wait for him, wait for him, wait for him.
[99:42.86]I'll get him on the running back.
[99:43.77]I'll get him on the run around here.
[99:44.57]He's going to come around here.
[99:45.89]Watch this shit.
[99:47.85]Here he comes around the corner.
[99:48.87]He's going to wrap around.
[99:49.83]Three, two, one.
[99:52.80]No, never mind.
[100:19.07]Oh, by the way, if the game lags out, it doesn't count.
[100:23.36]One.
[100:33.38]Two.
[100:43.50]Three.
[100:44.94]Oops.
[100:48.08]Three.
[100:51.81]That's mine.
[100:52.29]He had the last stand thing.
[100:53.27]I killed him.
[101:03.77]This is mine.
[101:04.43]Mine.
[101:08.20]How is this guy still alive?
[101:14.70]I told you to leave me alone.
[101:18.31]Okay, does that negate the other one?
[101:21.05]I think that negates it, oh shit.
[101:27.56]Okay, run, run, run, run, run!
[101:31.08]That doesn't negate it, it doesn't negate it, I win.
[101:34.42]I got more than three, I got four.
[101:35.92]Oh my god, this game is fucking bonkers.
[101:45.39]That's four with a team kill, so it was minus one, which means it's three.
[101:52.61]He seriously just walked into it though.
[101:55.70]How many people do you think back in medieval times like fucking killed each other accidentally?
[102:03.20]Think about this, if there was a giant battle like this shit... You're gonna swing in a circle and you're gonna hit five people.
[102:15.73]Don't ever charge in with anybody.
[102:17.19]Yeah, Archer was where it was at.
[102:22.06]You couldn't accidentally take off a friend's head with an axe.
[102:30.12]Ooh, that was pretty clean, that one hit right there.
[102:39.69]Oh shit.
[102:47.28]Come on.
[102:49.88]Ooh, what's that?
[102:50.90]How did that feel?
[102:52.50]How did that one feel?
[102:53.24]Dude, there goes your head.
[102:53.94]Alright, I'm starting to get the hang of this shit.
[103:01.27]Ooh, that was a little delay.
[103:12.63]This is pretty high.
[103:13.31]Alright, let's get back here.
[103:18.64]That wouldn't be that guy's shield.
[103:22.14]Oops.
[103:26.10]Ooh, is this thrusting swords?
[103:46.94]Is that me screaming?
[103:48.22]What's the emotes?
[103:54.01]Oh, the scoundrel loadout.
[103:54.97]Okay.
[103:55.73]I should do that.
[103:56.13]Let's try it.
[103:56.99]Although I'm getting used to axe guy.
[103:59.85]A lot of people coming up.
[104:08.54]Oh!
[104:08.60]Oh!
[104:15.27]Oh, man.
[104:15.73]That guy got killed by something.
[104:17.45]I think that guy got trapped on here.
[104:21.66]He's playing like Gmod Deathrun.
[104:23.26]The guy like turned on the spikes.
[104:28.26]Oops, sorry.
[104:36.42]Oh, yeah.
[104:37.32]That was team damage, but I killed somebody.
[104:40.22]It's okay.
[104:48.35]Went in for a big hit there.
[104:53.11]Where do you think you're going?
[104:54.59]What was that guy doing?
[104:56.79]There was no plan for that guy.
[104:59.31]Oh, I walked into it.
[105:00.19]Shit.
[105:03.76]Saying sorry won't grow that guy's arms back.
[105:06.16]It's true.
[105:40.29]What?
[105:40.55]I must have got headshot by something.
[105:57.84]Why are these guys... What are you guys doing?
[106:02.68]Guys, guys, guys...
[106:05.89]Alright, we're gonna have to quarantine this guy.
[106:07.97]Yep.
[106:11.23]Excuse me, can I get a little help here?
[106:12.47]This guy went rogue.
[106:21.62]Oh no, he's been taken by the madness!
[106:37.05]I kind of want to get on a horse and just ride around like an asshole.
[106:47.11]Like that.
[106:47.47]I thought there was a guy hiding.
[106:57.04]Oh, damn it.
[106:57.64]That guy would have been dead.
[106:59.80]What just... What is killing me from behind?
[107:02.08]Alright, I want to do... Whoops.
[107:04.88]Let's try Scoundrel.
[107:12.30]It's me.
[107:17.44]Okay, so what do you have?
[107:18.34]I got Fireball.
[107:20.04]This is the guy that's like the magician.
[107:21.20]Okay.
[107:21.46]So what's the swings like?
[107:29.38]A lot of thrusts, I would say, with this dude.
[107:40.49]There it is.
[107:42.70]Alright, behind.
[107:45.30]Ooh, shit.
[107:49.06]This guy ain't gonna make it out alive.
[107:50.58]No, right into my sword.
[107:51.82]Come here, right into it.
[107:56.38]Really?
[108:07.81]What?!
[108:08.37]He took off!
[108:09.15]God, I don't care!
[108:10.39]That was bullshit!
[108:12.63]What?
[108:12.97]You've got to be kidding me.
[108:22.21]I don't even need to say anything.
[108:25.35]You guys already know.
[108:30.93]You already know.
[108:38.21]Swing!
[108:38.65]What the hell?
[108:40.12]Lag, lag, lag, lag, lag.
[108:44.53]I tried to swing again.
[108:45.45]Input wasn't done.
[108:47.97]No input.
[108:56.62]Oh, fuck.
[109:02.80]I have an arrow in my arm.
[109:12.40]What?!
[109:14.14]What?!
[109:17.64]I was doing alright.
[109:20.92]He's a stabbed spammer.
[109:22.56]They're having server issues due to way more people playing it than expect- I thought that guy was aiming from my head.
[109:32.19]I need to use the fire bombs too.
[109:36.81]Is that a- who's up there?
[109:38.53]Is that a guy in red or blue?
[109:39.59]I can't tell.
[109:41.63]I think he's blue.
[109:42.03]Alright, I'm gonna put this down at a strategic location after I do this.
[109:48.17]Oops.
[109:59.36]Did I just step in my own trap?
[110:02.62]I was too busy paying attention to what this guy was doing.
[110:08.37]Oh my god, okay.
[110:10.09]No more Scoundrel.
[110:11.23]I'm going back to Raider.
[110:15.23]That guy distracted me too much.
[110:16.51]Dude, that guy distracted me into another class.
[110:26.72]What a god I've been... I'm going.
[110:29.82]You know what?
[110:30.48]I'll show you what I'm gonna do.
[110:32.38]You wanna see how we do this?
[110:33.34]How I would do this in a real war?
[110:36.79]I'll show you real war Elbertson right here.
[110:45.38]Oh fuck, there's two of them.
[110:47.18]I'm just kidding, this is not what I would do.
[110:57.26]Is this the guy laughing at me?
[110:58.30]That's too many.
[111:05.30]If that guy didn't come over and start distracting me into another clap.
[111:08.60]Alright, we're getting kind of destroyed here.
[111:16.52]Press V. That's pretty good.
[111:20.18]Alright, I should be able to get this guy from behind here.
[111:25.06]Blade's smart.
[111:26.30]This guy's distracted.
[111:29.40]Ooh!
[111:30.14]Caught him.
[111:33.26]What?
[111:34.06]What happened to my sword?
[111:35.80]My axe?
[111:36.72]My... Okay.
[111:39.21]I think it's because maybe the packet loss removed it.
[111:50.62]Ah!
[111:51.40]Oh no, I'm stuck!
[111:56.30]God!
[111:58.38]Get it!
[112:03.10]You little weasel!
[112:04.90]Nobody can catch him!
[112:07.44]He's taking down our defenses!
[112:09.19]Alright, pickle, just like in baseball.
[112:11.61]You gotta be fucking kidding me, you little rabbit.
[112:17.49]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[112:20.51]We were just chasing that guy in a circle and nobody could catch him.
[112:30.24]We were gonna pickle him and it didn't work.
[112:32.97]Alright, I'm gonna start playing the game again because I was top 5 and now I'm like in the bottom.
[112:44.80]Okay.
[112:45.96]They're in our fort now, this is bad.
[113:02.92]I got it.
[113:04.22]Relax.
[113:04.84]Everybody relax.
[113:07.22]They're gonna drop down here.
[113:08.38]Watch this.
[113:08.82]He's gonna drop down, isn't he?
[113:15.58]Drop down.
[113:20.10]Alright, well, I made the boards shake, so he fell.
[113:26.40]What is going on?
[113:28.77]What?
[113:30.09]Ow.
[113:31.19]Ow.
[113:31.49]Oh, there's a lot.
[113:32.09]Never mind.
[113:43.35]I somehow ended up back here.
[113:46.42]And he ended up behind me.
[113:53.54]I swung at the guy and then I teleported back and the guy was behind me and killed me.
[114:01.07]What the heck?
[114:02.83]No swears here.
[114:04.23]Only H-E-C-K.
[114:09.39]They're gonna take it right now.
[114:16.31]I'm trying to get this dude that's running behind.
[114:20.07]Damn it.
[114:21.63]Damn it.
[114:22.05]Oh my god, I helped him.
[114:28.68]Wait, that guy turned to dust.
[114:31.68]How does that make any sense?
[114:32.98]Oh, no, no, no, he threw it.
[114:33.86]Okay.
[114:34.26]Alright, get up on the battlements.
[114:42.44]They're killing each other.
[114:46.37]No, too many.
[114:47.11]You're dead, man.
[114:47.69]You can't be over there.
[114:48.39]I gotta help him.
[114:51.63]I'm going this way.
[114:56.01]They're coming up here.
[114:57.27]Scoundrel.
[114:58.15]I'm taking his head off now.
[114:59.45]You're not gonna get away with this shit.
[115:04.06]Not this time.
[115:07.84]Wrap around back.
[115:15.28]Oh, this is bad.
[115:15.78]They know.
[115:28.85]Ohhhhh!
[115:29.43]Kill the archer!
[115:30.07]Kill the archer!
[115:30.69]Kill the archer!
[115:31.33]Kill the archer!
[115:35.25]Oh, I had too many people behind me.
[115:36.47]10 and 15.
[115:48.18]Die to the archer?
[115:50.34]No.
[115:51.10]I died to archer.
[115:52.28]I finally got money.
[115:55.00]You're talking about died to the...
[115:56.88]Eight people that were behind me.
[116:02.28]Ah, I think... Are we... Can I... Is it... Are we good now?
[116:07.65]I like this game mode, though.
[116:08.47]It's fun.
[116:13.65]Progression seems to be working.
[116:16.77]That's good.
[116:22.78]Chase that paper.
[116:25.82]I want to see what other weapons they have.
[116:26.94]Alright, who do I like?
[116:31.98]Um... I don't know.
[116:36.61]They're all kind of fun to play.
[116:38.15]Let me try Archer again.
[116:50.40]Unarmed or bust?
[116:51.98]No, I'm not very good with unarmed.
[116:55.10]Can we both get on?
[117:01.29]There's MANY more weapons for you to customize.
[117:03.59]That's awesome.
[117:06.93]So we got our first... OHHHHH!
[117:18.06]That was a guy in VRChat.
[117:22.50]I'm gonna go this way.
[117:24.57]I think they're wrapping around over here.
[117:25.71]Yep.
[117:35.68]Watch out!
[117:36.16]Get off the horse!
[117:37.26]Get... Oh, fuck.
[117:43.34]Help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help!
[117:47.32]Oh, dead.
[117:51.52]That guy just ran in with the horse.
[117:58.68]you've been hunted I gotta get a good perch looks like we're right in the middle what's with all the swords there this guy's taking out everybody really come on he just took out three people this guy is killing everyone
[118:36.59]Oh my god!
[118:37.51]I've done 50 something damage to him so far.
[118:42.96]Did I kill him?
[118:45.08]Jesus.
[118:46.09]That guy was unstoppable.
[119:08.02]Got him.
[119:13.52]Damn.
[119:23.12]I'm actually glad that the arrows are hard to use.
[119:25.98]Because they're not... It's... It'd be... Oh my god, there's somebody up here.
[119:31.61]It's hard to use the bow.
[119:33.99]You gotta be really, really precise.
[119:38.36]But it kind of has to be like that, because otherwise it would be really, really powerful if it was really, really easy to use.
[119:53.83]There's crossbows, are there?
[119:56.61]That's interesting.
[119:57.27]Alright.
[120:04.74]I got him.
[120:05.60]I got to kill him right already.
[120:10.06]Oh, fuck each other.
[120:11.78]I'm just being a dickhead now.
[120:13.28]Alright.
[120:14.50]Back to Raider.
[120:21.03]I'm trying to do too many things.
[120:22.43]Just stay with one thing and do it well.
[120:26.07]I'm jumping around too much.
[120:45.60]Okay, let's go.
[120:53.01]Bring out the knives.
[121:04.43]Oh!
[121:04.67]I got him right in the head!
[121:12.12]Shit.
[121:12.26]Alright, this is bad.
[121:14.06]I don't want to be on the bridge.
[121:17.61]Bridge bad.
[121:18.77]Because I can do that.
[121:20.65]Yeah, okay.
[121:21.43]Well, is that... Does somebody... I didn't get team killed, right?
[121:28.05]No, I did.
[121:28.85]No, I didn't.
[121:40.06]Can you cut the bridge?
[121:40.96]You might be able to.
[121:41.76]Maybe.
[121:42.32]Maybe.
[121:51.43]This guy is... needs to die.
[121:53.83]I'm gonna go straight on.
[121:54.93]Ooh.
[122:06.94]That hurts.
[122:07.58]Is he alive?
[122:08.80]He's alive!
[122:09.32]Oh, fuck.
[122:13.03]I thought he was dead.
[122:13.73]He went on the ground.
[122:23.98]I was hoping I was gonna catch somebody with one of those.
[122:26.10]Just right, like, in the face.
[122:27.12]Alright, not good.
[122:29.52]I'm gonna go.
[122:36.41]Watch out for the fire.
[122:37.11]When the fire goes, I'm going.
[122:39.25]They're climbing up and in.
[122:40.75]They're going inside.
[122:42.01]They're up here!
[122:45.85]They're already in!
[122:48.14]Oh shit, that guy looked blue.
[122:49.38]Look at how blue that guy looks.
[122:50.32]I'm so sorry.
[122:51.56]He looked blue in the shadow.
[122:52.92]He did.
[122:54.16]He really did.
[122:54.76]Alright.
[123:06.54]Are they clear out of here?
[123:11.01]Yeah, we're good.
[123:18.16]He's almost dead.
[123:20.84]Shit.
[123:29.81]Ooh, I just cleaved.
[123:31.53]Ooh!
[123:35.07]Ooh!
[123:36.79]Uh-oh, shit.
[123:37.77]Bad.
[123:39.55]I had a chance there.
[123:51.23]Can you still do the overhead swing?
[123:53.87]Uh, you can do this.
[123:55.69]And then... That's a little stab there.
[124:02.14]The poke with the axe seems pretty bad.
[124:04.84]Yeah, I would assume it would be.
[124:07.24]Just try to change it up so they don't think you're gonna do the same swing every time.
[124:18.99]That guy right in the lip.
[124:20.53]I busted that guy's lip.
[124:21.55]I just gave him a fat lip.
[124:22.53]That's all I did.
[124:24.67]Goodbye.
[124:25.11]How?
[124:25.19]That guy blocked so many hits.
[124:29.27]What a fucking pro.
[124:30.08]I ain't gonna let you do that shit.
[124:32.40]Sorry, dude.
[124:39.34]No.
[124:40.38]Somebody had to deal with you.
[124:41.83]It might as well have been me.
[124:49.21]Goodbye!
[124:49.93]That huge cleave, I love it.
[124:59.96]Oops.
[125:00.84]Hold on, I'll help you here.
[125:04.60]Damn it.
[125:04.86]I was trying to help.
[125:06.92]We're gonna kill each other in here.
[125:11.06]Alright, well there's too many of us in here.
[125:12.46]This is bad.
[125:15.44]That motherfucker is still alive.
[125:19.82]Remarkably.
[125:20.46]Okay, I'm going up this way.
[125:29.92]We gotta push out of here.
[125:32.10]Oh dear, they got a horse.
[125:33.18]Where's he going?
[125:41.84]He's all the way around.
[125:42.95]He's gonna wrap inside of here.
[125:49.23]Where the hell did he go?
[125:50.01]Who keeps fucking team killing?
[125:56.39]You fucking idiots.
[126:00.23]That's not my team.
[126:01.46]You can't blame that one on me, guys.
[126:03.62]Not my team.
[126:20.85]Ah, shit from behind.
[126:22.11]Damn it.
[126:23.19]I was gonna look behind me too.
[126:28.43]Who knew this would get so heated in chat?
[126:30.29]This dude's fucking team killing, you fucking idiots.
[126:46.76]Is there a way to shit from the front?
[126:49.30]Oh.
[126:50.04]I see what you're doing here.
[126:54.20]Dammit, fire sucks.
[126:55.81]Did I get his leg off?
[127:13.72]Holy shit, I went backwards.
[127:24.47]Was he hopping on one leg?
[127:25.53]It looked like it, yeah.
[127:26.29]Alright, another string of legs for you four in a row here.
[127:32.53]I gotta climb back up to, like, top five.
[127:34.49]Come on.
[127:36.21]I can't just be this bad.
[127:38.56]I have to be good.
[127:39.24]This is the first little area.
[127:47.88]This is where it's contested.
[127:48.92]You know what?
[127:54.21]Am I dead if I go in the water?
[127:55.31]I don't know if water is an instant kill.
[128:04.99]Alright, here's the conflict.
[128:07.23]Watch from behind.
[128:13.55]Who keeps team killing, you fucking idiot?
[128:20.61]Checking behind.
[128:23.12]There's a person behind.
[128:24.20]Is he still there?
[128:29.92]Oh, you think you can escape me?
[128:43.33]Oops.
[128:46.77]Oh shit, no.
[128:47.73]I didn't...
[128:52.11]I was locked in tunnel vision again, trying to hit that guy with an axe on the bridge.
[129:07.51]Jeremy, you just team killed, you fucking idiots.
[129:11.17]Jeremy, you just team killed, you fucking idiots.
[129:14.43]What?
[129:22.10]Oh, I didn't want to hit them.
[129:30.74]I'm just gonna do the same shit to you, man.
[129:37.76]Too many.
[129:38.34]Too many.
[129:38.92]Too many.
[129:39.30]They're all... Too many!
[129:43.87]Too many!
[129:48.47]I gotta get like... No.
[129:51.68]Look at this ping.
[129:54.07]Everyone's ping jumps up to like 400.
[129:55.65]How many tickets do we need?
[130:11.87]What are we playing until?
[130:15.32]I'm sort of confused.
[130:16.18]Is it like 1,800?
[130:26.09]I really wanna just dig in there.
[130:33.62]Thank you.
[130:38.56]That's what I wanted to do!
[130:40.52]Just dig the fuck in!
[130:47.56]No, fuck!
[130:49.36]I'm so tunneled in!
[130:54.67]I'm so tunneled in, I just get- all I think of is hit guy in face with axe.
[131:08.40]I'm just- I- Me swing axe.
[131:11.82]Me do damage to face.
[131:16.24]What about limbs?
[131:17.22]No.
[131:19.86]What about throw the axe?
[131:21.80]No.
[131:24.09]Only damage in face.
[131:27.13]Only.
[131:29.47]You're an idiot.
[131:31.61]OK.
[131:36.77]Me, only damage in face.
[131:39.51]Oh.
[131:48.38]Got right in the way.
[132:01.07]Me run.
[132:04.65]Me run.
[132:05.02]Is that guy red?
[132:13.16]Why is he blue?
[132:15.08]He's got blue tint all over him.
[132:18.96]Me hit.
[132:19.73]Me don't care if team or not.
[132:21.31]Me hit face.
[132:27.29]Me miss.
[132:31.39]Me not very good at game.
[132:45.44]Me not understand how ping work.
[132:49.61]Seem like should have landed.
[132:54.01]Me dead.
[133:01.89]What do I play?
[133:07.26]Footman?
[133:08.10]I don't know.
[133:08.54]I just... I'm so excited.
[133:15.45]Hey, can you stop by hitting teammates?
[133:19.41]No.
[133:20.57]Why?
[133:20.95]It's not that hard.
[133:21.75]We have different... Everyone's a different... We're the same color.
[133:27.37]Red.
[133:28.17]Yes.
[133:29.23]Okay.
[133:30.58]Me hit red.
[133:31.44]No!
[133:39.60]I don't want you to hit red.
[133:46.37]We go for blue.
[133:48.59]I try.
[133:51.23]Well try harder, stupid!
[134:15.48]Hey, don't do that.
[134:19.20]What?
[134:21.08]I'm fucking confused.
[134:40.55]Good thing he... Don't do the joke, play!
[134:50.91]I had an opportunity there.
[134:52.07]I had an opportunity to kill two or three people in a row.
[134:59.94]I got a medic bag.
[135:14.95]Alright, let's give it some poke.
[135:17.63]Poke, poke, poke.
[135:19.91]Find the opportunity.
[135:21.03]Don't get involved in a situation where you're going to get yourself killed.
[135:25.82]Take it easy.
[135:26.62]That's... Okay, I just stepped into the bonfire.
[135:35.57]What was that guy?
[135:35.95]The guy was holding his weapon the other way?
[135:37.55]Oh, right.
[135:38.57]Okay, that was confusing.
[135:39.41]Fuck out of me.
[135:41.69]Can I do that?
[135:43.55]What does that do?
[135:47.05]Does every weapon have, like, a different way to hold it?
[135:51.61]I don't think so.
[135:57.67]Most of them do.
[135:58.34]Okay.
[135:59.84]So now it makes it... Hmm.
[136:15.21]Stab!
[136:22.86]Really?
[136:26.21]How did that not land?
[136:30.03]I'm trying to kick him off the fucking edge.
[136:34.85]Did I?
[136:38.66]What happened?
[136:42.54]I think he fell off.
[136:44.16]I did.
[136:44.96]I did what I wanted to do.
[136:45.96]Yeah, he's dead.
[136:47.02]He's dead.
[136:48.44]Get the horse?
[136:48.96]I feel like there's only one horse, and it only spawns... We have one horse.
[137:03.61]Oh, he had the five second life perk.
[137:05.23]I did kill him, though.
[137:08.59]That guy's coming in so much blood.
[137:12.59]Alright, let's pick... Oh, come on.
[137:20.97]Really?
[137:21.61]Why the fuck am I so focused?
[137:25.72]These huge, huge player battles... My brain... It's just... I get locked into one thing for more than one second and I'm dead.
[137:37.74]Let's go knight.
[137:43.58]When there's 50 people on the battlefield, I'm just like, wait, what about this guy up there?
[137:48.07]Oh, he's dancing.
[137:49.69]Oh, that's fun.
[137:51.07]And then I'm dead.
[138:03.33]Hit A?
[138:03.93]Do A?
[138:04.29]Alright, I will.
[138:13.04]I'm trying to not... It's so easy to hit somebody in the head you don't want to hit.
[138:23.01]Alright, I helped.
[138:33.10]Ooh, got them both.
[138:35.26]Ooh!
[138:44.79]Alright, give me that.
[138:47.61]Whoa!
[138:47.77]Alright, we're clearing them out.
[139:01.98]Hey!
[139:03.50]Don't do that.
[139:07.28]Right into my trap that I didn't lay.
[139:15.67]Archer.
[139:16.03]Oh, that was delayed.
[139:22.96]What?
[139:23.50]I'm... okay.
[139:26.96]That was... odd.
[139:29.50]Of course I... okay, of course I get hit.
[139:37.35]I'm the one that takes the one hit in the head and dies.
[139:51.34]I'm actually pulling it back.
[139:59.63]It always happens to me.
[140:00.41]It never happens to anybody else.
[140:01.69]It only happens to me.
[140:03.96]It's not fair.
[140:04.60]Like, this guy doesn't have to deal with high ping.
[140:09.52]Only me.
[140:12.29]Okay, this is a bad idea.
[140:28.98]You're running into me I'm just like in the worst place at the worst time apparently No, I'm trapped in here
[140:53.51]This is not a place I want to be.
[140:56.05]Too many bodies.
[141:03.83]Does anybody know what killed me?
[141:11.36]That wasn't an arrow.
[141:12.06]It was a mace.
[141:19.56]I got maced.
[141:30.60]That's team damage.
[141:39.06]What are you doing here?
[141:54.07]No, no, no, no, no.
[141:57.80]Oh, god damn it.
[142:07.65]It's just such a mess.
[142:15.06]Oh, sorry!
[142:16.80]Sorry, this is medieval times.
[142:18.58]It just happens.
[142:21.70]I'm getting up there.
[142:24.04]Somebody hit that guy.
[142:29.68]I'm gonna fucking throw an axe this guy.
[142:37.89]Oh, he just moved at the fucking worst time!
[142:40.34]He died.
[142:55.29]He fell.
[142:56.55]It's okay.
[142:57.55]I've done it before too.
[143:22.08]How?
[143:22.22]Are we still ahead?
[143:27.34]I think the axe is my favorite weapon.
[143:29.35]The bow is my favorite weapon, but I can't use it because I'm not good enough.
[143:33.17]And I've accepted that.
[143:46.05]Jesus Christ.
[143:48.47]Yo, Jesus!
[143:49.45]Man, what, do I have a target on my back?
[143:52.57]There's like four people.
[144:03.37]It was like four of us standing there.
[144:04.87]Can you help me?
[144:20.82]Help!
[144:23.17]Upset because angry.
[144:24.55]Mad because bad.
[144:25.77]Bad because bad.
[144:37.90]He blocked him.
[144:38.60]He's blocking me.
[144:39.44]We're just throwing rocks at this guy.
[144:41.06]What?
[144:44.27]What?
[144:53.21]Alright, this guy's gotta go.
[144:58.81]Where is he?
[145:13.78]Um, it's- Does that person- That person had- How did you do that?
[145:20.51]How did you do that?
[145:23.23]You have to have like eight arms with like three different mice to do what he just did.
[145:26.66]He has like four keyboards.
[145:40.98]Watch out for the archer.
[145:51.28]Okay, good.
[145:52.38]Charge?
[145:52.84]I need health.
[145:56.29]Okay, alright.
[145:57.79]Okay.
[146:08.82]I just got sacked.
[146:09.94]I'm the fucking quarterback and the guy just sacked me.
[146:13.84]What?
[146:14.08]What?
[146:28.85]A meltdown stream.
[146:30.05]No, I just hiked the ball.
[146:32.81]It was 10 defensive linemen there.
[146:34.49]Offensive linemen.
[146:35.69]And he got through them and he sacked me.
[146:39.13]Alright, I want to do a different game mode.
[146:49.00]Oh, I want to make a class.
[146:57.59]Room temperature IQ rants about game mechanics.
[147:01.02]That was a 500 ping server.
[147:06.42]I'm not going to let that hurt me.
[147:07.92]Because no fucking way.
[147:20.69]I can't believe it.
[147:21.41]You have people jumping in front of you and killing you.
[147:25.03]You jump up to 650 ping.
[147:27.73]Nah, you just got a room temperature IQ.
[147:32.70]Get outta here with that.
[147:33.98]I ain't gonna hear that.
[147:47.28]Whatever, I don't care.
[147:48.04]One point?
[147:52.56]Okay, I get 16 points.
[148:02.78]IQ test stream.
[148:04.26]No, I'm just fucking around.
[148:05.28]I'm not bad.
[148:06.26]I'm just fucking around.
[148:11.26]I can't unlock this?
[148:13.71]Why?
[148:23.63]Two points.
[148:24.13]I just don't have 16 points.
[148:27.89]I don't have it unlocked.
[148:28.71]Unlocked.
[148:31.82]Oh.
[148:32.38]Okay.
[148:34.61]So I don't have anything unlocked.
[148:37.19]So I can't make a custom class unless I do nothing.
[148:40.65]Fists.
[148:47.31]Restart the game?
[148:48.01]Okay.
[148:52.17]Try that.
[148:56.93]More howl.
[149:01.68]Let's try it again.
[149:05.90]I'm sorry, that was loud.
[149:15.17]It was too easy.
[149:15.97]What are you talking about?
[149:18.61]What are you talking about?
[149:19.53]I already did that, too.
[149:26.77]That's unfortunate.
[149:27.94]Alright, can I... No?
[149:28.96]Can I?
[149:35.43]There we go.
[149:36.65]Okay.
[149:39.29]500 gold to buy.
[149:40.25]Hmm.
[149:42.47]How much money do I have?
[149:44.83]1120.
[149:49.73]300 for a dagger, wooden mallet, cleaver.
[149:53.47]Primary.
[149:54.13]Training sword.
[149:55.59]Really?
[149:56.01]You can use a wooden sword?
[149:59.51]Quarterstaff?
[150:03.21]Arming sword.
[150:04.11]Damage, speed, and reach.
[150:05.83]I think I want this thing.
[150:10.55]Little one-handed little... I'm getting it.
[150:22.38]Arming sword.
[150:24.86]Secondary, I want... Oh, there's actually a lot of stuff here.
[150:37.16]Wow, longsword?
[150:38.16]No.
[150:38.90]I need something small.
[150:42.60]I need like a little secondary.
[150:46.69]One two-handed, one-handed shield, shield.
[150:48.83]Maybe I should get a little shield.
[150:51.13]A little targe.
[150:51.81]I think I'm going to get this.
[151:04.01]And then tertiary armor.
[151:07.42]Standage, quarterstaff, training sword, firebomb.
[151:10.06]Maybe I should get the firebombs.
[151:12.90]Get the loot.
[151:13.56]Rock.
[151:16.30]I don't need to see anything else.
[151:18.88]Okay.
[151:20.14]Body.
[151:21.16]Fat.
[151:21.44]Okay.
[151:29.17]Armor.
[151:29.47]I don't have any more money.
[151:37.98]I can make myself look like a total dickhead.
[151:39.66]That's what I'm going for here.
[151:43.50]I can't get anything else.
[151:45.09]Alright, shoulders?
[151:46.13]No.
[151:48.51]I have not enough money.
[151:49.39]Alright, so then body, face, and voice.
[151:53.67]Perfect.
[152:17.93]This is just Geralt.
[152:19.85]Whatever.
[152:21.29]Facial hair.
[152:21.87]Alright.
[152:32.46]So this is... Wait, you can... I can actually do this?
[152:36.56]Holy shit, wait a minute.
[152:47.95]I guess it's not that big of a deal.
[152:56.59]It's not that huge.
[153:04.24]Five hours in, we're at the character creator.
[153:06.12]Okay, that's fine.
[153:19.15]So, we have you.
[153:20.47]I need to edit you.
[153:23.64]We need to do skills, right?
[153:26.58]Where's the skills?
[153:27.32]And they're like, perks are up here.
[153:32.84]Alright, so... Friendly fire reduction.
[153:37.32]Absolutely.
[153:38.74]Extra stamina on hit.
[153:41.67]Full health on melee kills.
[153:44.86]And reduces fire damage by 80% because I walk in it all the time.
[153:49.99]I think they're ready.
[153:53.93]There's better armor for free.
[153:57.73]Oh.
[154:01.61]There is.
[154:02.73]But it costs one point.
[154:03.55]I think he's alright for now.
[154:11.82]There's more free armor.
[154:13.24]Chainmail.
[154:14.02]Oh.
[154:15.44]What level am I?
[154:16.62]Two.
[154:17.78]I can do Chainmail, but it's two points.
[154:19.72]So that means I have to remove... These are very important because I'm fucking terrible.
[154:27.99]You're wearing a hospital gown.
[154:35.11]Alright.
[154:35.85]I'll get it.
[154:36.21]Metal Tint?
[154:44.42]Metal Tint?
[154:46.35]Oh, that's cool.
[154:53.55]Hospital gone.
[154:58.75]Okay.
[155:00.61]That's all I can do.
[155:02.33]Chainmail, legs, I don't need them.
[155:05.44]I'm ready to fight.
[155:08.34]Fight.
[155:10.22]Should I do Battle Royale again?
[155:12.08]Try BR again?
[155:18.40]Horde mode?
[155:18.92]I'm going to try BR again.
[155:23.02]I know, I know, I know, I don't want to watch you battle royale, you fucking wanker.
[155:28.14]You fucking wanker.
[155:30.54]Just relax.
[155:41.36]What is horde mode?
[155:42.30]It's probably just survival.
[155:48.46]I think you're the one that needs to relax.
[155:52.82]No, I'm fine.
[155:54.36]You relax.
[155:54.92]How about we all collectively relax at the same time?
[156:03.59]See?
[156:04.39]Don't you feel better?
[156:10.79]You fucking relax.
[156:14.11]No, you relax.
[156:15.39]You relax.
[156:16.96]Check my emails while we hang out here.
[156:21.90]I'm just going to read you the first email that I have in my inbox.
[156:28.37]It's from JetBlue.
[156:31.81]It's talking about how there's sale right now for airfare.
[156:37.10]I guess.
[156:37.98]Interestingly enough.
[156:40.18]This is just my first email.
[156:41.82]I'm not kidding around.
[156:44.86]First email in the list.
[156:47.28]You still use email.
[156:48.38]What, you don't have an email?
[156:50.21]How do you not have an email?
[156:52.71]How do you get a bunch of stuff you don't want to open and a bunch of trash?
[156:55.85]How do you go to a retail store and give them your email so they leave you alone?
[157:10.13]You want to sign up for rewards?
[157:11.39]Sure, who cares?
[157:21.81]Guys, I have like... I'm pretty sure I have like 44,000 unread emails.
[157:37.83]And I would say probably 80-90% of them are like... coupons from Whole Foods.
[157:50.45]Overhead swing.
[157:55.19]Ooh, a little jab.
[157:57.81]I didn't think I was gonna do that.
[158:03.05]Who's next?
[158:03.49]That was mine.
[158:14.61]Did you sign up for the stupid rewards programs?
[158:20.97]Yeah, the joke's on them.
[158:22.15]I don't even open the email account.
[158:26.13]You know, jokes on them.
[158:26.97]They probably go to their email and they see that I haven't opened it.
[158:32.85]This guy won't open anything.
[158:34.09]What the fuck?
[158:36.29]Because don't open it because then they'll know.
[158:38.56]Their little read receipts will be on.
[158:48.92]What am I doing?
[159:01.62]Um, can I... can I run?
[159:05.93]Is he dead?
[159:08.09]No!
[159:08.49]Stop rubberbanding me around!
[159:10.05]What the hell?
[159:13.15]That's a loud and scary noise.
[159:23.66]Well, I got on a horse and punched somebody, and then I ran in place for five seconds.
[159:42.32]That was a rage quit?
[159:43.24]No, it wasn't.
[159:43.66]I got kicked out.
[159:44.62]I'm gonna try this one more time.
[159:59.73]BR sucks.
[160:00.77]Yeah, but that's, come on, that's gonna get me the views.
[160:16.60]I would turn my webcam on and show you how it's gonna get me the fucking views, but... Dude, I have no clothes on.
[160:33.83]Alright, here we go.
[160:36.01]I'm gonna actually give it an attempt this time.
[160:39.93]No facecam, no views.
[160:41.87]Do I have arrows?
[160:52.82]Oh shit, he has the same thing.
[160:58.92]Got plenty of arrows.
[161:00.76]Someone's gonna drop down around behind me or something.
[161:03.40]I hear somebody.
[161:03.92]Alright, I gotta move.
[161:09.51]Got a crossbow as well.
[161:10.57]I've never even used the crossbow.
[161:11.71]Is it good?
[161:20.60]Ah!
[161:21.62]That's such a scary fucking noise.
[161:23.60]They need to turn that down.
[161:26.61]I think that's an arrow hitting right next to my head.
[161:28.69]Okay, I gotta go back to the bow.
[161:40.68]Ah, goddammit.
[161:53.47]Fuck Battle Royale.
[161:56.25]You watch another streamer do it.
[162:06.44]They won't be hard to find, trust me.
[162:17.35]Can you imagine somebody coming back?
[162:18.47]Hey dude, um, I know you said like I could go find another Battle Royale story.
[162:22.10]I couldn't find one.
[162:24.72]I searched.
[162:25.20]I was done with the browse and the category list.
[162:27.18]I didn't find anyone playing Battle Royale.
[162:31.30]Are you sure?
[162:32.12]Maybe that you were just speaking, um, out of tone there.
[162:38.33]That's what I would do if I was like a troll in chat right now.
[162:41.03]I'd be like, hey dude, I couldn't find anybody playing BR.
[162:42.65]Could you play it again?
[163:06.43]What's Battle Royale?
[163:28.42]Just the word Royale makes me sad.
[163:35.96]It shouldn't.
[163:36.72]I don't think anyone's playing this mode.
[163:56.19]Well.
[163:56.91]Alright, let's try the actual browser.
[163:58.95]Oh my god, what happened?
[164:00.15]Uh...
[164:07.43]I think it started?
[164:18.27]Check your emails in the meantime.
[164:19.55]Alright, arming sword.
[164:30.23]It's 60.
[164:32.39]Oh, I see.
[164:32.89]This is cool.
[164:39.23]Bandage?
[164:40.55]Maybe I should get a bandage.
[164:47.09]Wave 1.
[164:49.21]How easy is it to kill things?
[164:53.24]How did you get a knife?
[165:01.92]Where do they port?
[165:02.52]Is it just default enemies that you have to kill?
[165:11.60]Now, we're just playing COD Zombies now.
[165:13.72]Kind of.
[165:14.06]Alright, I see them.
[165:18.68]Don't go too far!
[165:22.94]Don't go too far!
[165:23.68]Is that an enemy?
[165:28.94]Uh, we just...
[166:15.98]Alright.
[166:27.33]Where are the enemies?
[166:36.04]Do we have to go looking for them?
[166:47.23]Are they just scattered around?
[166:48.35]They don't, like, come in the same place, it seems.
[166:50.48]It's a rock-killed stinky rat.
[167:01.59]Oh, they got in!
[167:02.67]They got in!
[167:03.93]The farmers got in!
[167:05.73]This is great!
[167:06.61]Oh my fucking god.
[167:16.33]Can I get his weapon?
[167:17.09]Alright, we did it.
[167:32.90]How much money have we got?
[167:33.48]34.
[167:33.50]Alright, give me a weapon.
[167:40.86]This side is 90.
[167:41.90]Damn it.
[167:46.97]Light legs, bandage, light helmet.
[167:50.55]No, I need a sword.
[167:55.92]God damn it, where's their weapon?
[167:57.62]Over here?
[167:57.94]Ammo, toolbox, chest.
[168:04.74]This one's 50.
[168:08.37]What about inside here?
[168:11.55]Bear trap?
[168:12.25]No.
[168:18.82]Uh, I'm not picking up any of that.
[168:21.33]Buy a sword?
[168:21.97]Yeah, I mean... Buy a bottle of rock.
[168:31.70]Rusty fork?
[168:32.50]I don't really only have enough.
[168:35.04]Rock OP.
[168:35.88]Yeah, I'm just gonna hit people in the face with the rock.
[168:41.32]Do I have to throw it?
[168:42.10]Does it throw?
[168:42.66]Yeah, it does.
[168:49.99]Got him.
[168:53.18]I got two more.
[168:56.38]Oh, fuck.
[168:58.80]Oh, that somehow got me.
[169:00.54]I got a raw.
[169:01.05]I'm dead.
[169:01.91]I'm dead.
[169:02.23]I'm dead.
[169:02.47]I'm dead.
[169:02.69]I'm dead.
[169:02.91]I'm dead.
[169:10.19]What?
[169:10.43]He got me with the backswing?
[169:11.86]He went all the way back?
[169:20.01]Ugh.
[169:30.56]Buy a sword?
[169:31.44]I don't even know where they are!
[169:35.44]Where are the weapons?
[169:40.12]They're just randomly kind of scattered out.
[169:41.78]There's like a dagger over here in this tent.
[169:45.25]There's a bear trap in there.
[169:47.93]Nothing in there.
[169:48.55]There's chests over here.
[169:50.97]Rocket the fire.
[169:51.83]Alright, I'm gonna go in here and get the dagger.
[170:26.65]It's near the spawn.
[170:30.53]So, like, back here.
[170:41.40]Ye olde no sword.
[170:42.80]Well, here they are.
[170:43.46]I can't afford them.
[170:47.48]It's those two.
[170:48.08]Where's that dagger?
[170:57.88]I can get a chest.
[170:59.60]Is it worth getting a chest?
[171:01.78]I'm gonna try it.
[171:06.91]Oh, nice.
[171:08.47]I got something to peel fucking apples with.
[171:18.57]Anybody need a potato peeled?
[171:19.77]That's what I can do with this.
[171:31.82]Throw it into the darkness.
[171:34.65]This thing is so tiny!
[171:36.27]How am I gonna kill anybody with this?
[171:59.72]What?! !
[172:02.33]Get away from me, please!
[172:14.76]Oh my goodness.
[172:25.16]Well, I didn't do the worst.
[172:36.15]I want to play the actual game.
[172:43.67]I want to play the actual video game.
[172:48.12]Against other players.
[172:52.76]It's VR.
[172:53.48]No, it's not.
[172:57.44]Alright, I'm going for it.
[173:05.52]Got a 64.
[173:06.38]There we go.
[173:10.62]What is this game mode?
[173:11.94]Is this... Protector.
[173:25.07]Do I have to wait until another game starts?
[173:35.75]How much is the game?
[173:36.45]It's like 26, 27 right now, right?
[173:40.79]Oh, it's only one life per round.
[173:42.61]Damn, alright.
[173:44.83]How did that guy... That guy fell off and grabbed the ledge.
[173:48.51]And didn't fall.
[173:49.29]That was incredible.
[173:58.35]Looks like Red has the upper hand.
[174:00.07]Not really, though.
[174:03.62]Turn around!
[174:04.74]Everybody has tunnel vision.
[174:05.88]It's so easy to get tunnel vision in this game.
[174:07.70]It seriously is.
[174:15.61]Oh, you're dead.
[174:16.37]Alright, here we go.
[174:23.15]Let's see how long I can last.
[174:49.48]Watch out to your side!
[174:55.90]Protector, get behind me!
[175:10.83]Behind!
[175:21.27]Nuh-uh.
[175:23.89]Oh.
[175:27.16]That's what we call a double kill.
[175:29.84]It's when you kill two people at the same time.
[175:31.76]I don't know if you've ever heard it before.
[175:33.48]I have a little bit.
[175:43.21]Oh, fuck.
[175:43.59]Oh, fuck.
[175:43.91]Oh, fuck.
[175:44.23]Oh, fuck.
[175:49.07]Oh.
[175:50.53]I was the only one left.
[175:54.69]It was 1v10.
[175:58.35]That was ridiculous.
[175:59.31]I thought... Tunnel vision, 2.0.
[176:01.23]I didn't even know I was the last person left.
[176:07.39]Oh, I thought I could catch him.
[176:14.42]Let's fuck the whole thing up.
[176:15.34]Watch this.
[176:40.36]Yeah, not a fall joke.
[176:41.64]It was actually fall.
[176:42.78]Fucking god damn it.
[176:44.30]No, why?
[176:58.41]It's called disorienting... Okay, blue team is so much better.
[177:03.54]I don't think anybody on blue team died.
[177:07.86]That's not fair.
[177:08.79]You can't put the NFL team against the peewee team.
[177:12.29]What are you proving here?
[177:18.59]We're not even gonna get two yards.
[177:19.75]That's another football reference if you're counting.
[177:21.93]Then at least two.
[177:32.62]Fuck, I'm dead.
[177:33.90]We're just getting fucking rolled.
[177:49.76]Stay alive.
[177:50.47]You can do it.
[178:00.01]How many are left?
[178:01.17]Come on.
[178:04.38]I know you can do it.
[178:05.82]My pregnant... My girlfriend pregnant.
[178:09.06]You can do it.
[178:09.80]Get him.
[178:10.62]Come out of AFK.
[178:11.26]That's too bad.
[178:12.42]That's too bad.
[178:15.41]There was an opportunity there.
[178:21.79]We're getting so badly beat.
[178:30.27]Alright.
[178:31.33]I gotta step it up here.
[178:32.25]Come on.
[178:33.37]Step it up.
[178:35.11]Red team blows.
[178:36.31]Hey!
[178:36.81]Don't say that.
[178:47.68]Good.
[178:48.04]Good.
[178:50.26]Push him back.
[179:11.81]It's too much.
[179:12.81]When we're getting beat this bad.
[179:16.78]This is bound to be some casual- I gotta change class.
[179:19.66]I'm gonna go, uh, I'm gonna go Raider.
[179:24.28]He pushed him into me and I hit him right in the face with a swing.
[179:27.62]But when we're losing this badly, there's only- look!
[179:30.52]Oh, I thought that was the girlfriend guy.
[179:41.58]Are we gonna win?
[179:42.83]Holy shit, how did they- were they just sitting in the back?
[179:45.13]How did you guys pull this off?
[179:50.45]I can't believe we just won.
[179:52.31]Wasn't there just a bunch of blue and not a bunch of red?
[179:58.06]Is the strategy to be AFK?
[180:00.62]Holy shit, we actually did it.
[180:06.08]Nice job, guys.
[180:07.85]Um, I think somebody's stuck inside of me.
[180:11.30]Yeah.
[180:13.76]Don't, please.
[180:14.84]Just... Don't shoot me!
[180:22.00]Don't shoot me, dude.
[180:22.92]Just... He's trying to shoot me.
[180:32.82]How did this even happen?
[180:41.13]Somebody just killed one of us.
[180:43.09]Just turn around and kill us, please.
[180:50.06]Okay.
[180:54.10]I don't know... That guy wasn't even connected to us.
[181:05.21]Got ya.
[181:10.30]Ooh, that was an uppercut.
[181:20.65]Got ya.
[181:23.61]I had a chance.
[181:24.39]Fuck.
[181:32.73]Ugh.
[181:34.97]Too many.
[181:40.63]Changing maps.
[181:41.39]This is kind of fun.
[181:43.45]This is fun.
[181:48.89]Well, the game's very... I think the game's more addicting than Chivalry.
[181:58.43]Chivalry was a lot of fun.
[181:59.32]Alright, Skirmish, Team Deathmatch.
[182:03.00]Hold on, are we gonna do... Does this mean that 64 people are free-for-all?
[182:16.12]no okay um I think stay raider this game is a mess in comparison it's kind of fun that way though
[182:46.04]That would have been a clip that somebody would have saved if any of those had landed.
[182:57.96]Hitmarker sound, yeah.
[182:59.38]Oh, watch out!
[182:59.74]Oh, watch out!
[183:11.37]Hello.
[183:12.71]Who is it?
[183:14.99]I think I just got shot in the back by the guy with the... I'm in trouble.
[183:23.91]There's so many here.
[183:24.89]Oh fuck.
[183:25.87]Oh my god.
[183:28.49]Was it bear trap?
[183:29.39]Oh.
[183:29.53]I thought I got shot from behind in the back of the head.
[183:37.45]Am I a drumstick or am I a wingman?
[183:39.21]Drumstick.
[183:42.01]Oh my fucking god.
[183:44.01]You're putting this here to... That it was there as a prank?
[183:48.23]I got pranked by my own team.
[183:49.88]That's what that was.
[183:55.26]I've walked in... Why is it in our spawn?
[183:57.46]That's the question you should be asking.
[184:01.69]Not did he walk in it, but why was it there?
[184:05.35]You ever stub your toe on something?
[184:08.53]You don't go, wow, he's literally blind.
[184:10.45]Oh my god.
[184:13.40]So if a friend of yours stubbed their toe on a sofa that's been in the same room for like five years, how many times have you done that?
[184:20.56]What, I didn't know there was a sofa there?
[184:21.54]Were you blind?
[184:23.46]No, you stub your toe.
[184:24.22]Sometimes you just stub your toe on shit.
[184:36.32]I do say that.
[184:37.38]Well, you're mean.
[184:38.72]Don't be so mean.
[184:54.64]God I do what how did none of those hit anyone Statistically speaking one of those had to have hit It was almost impossible to miss that No, it's not never mind
[185:35.15]I was trying to parry it.
[185:46.30]Easy.
[185:46.50]I had to be right there.
[186:03.35]Let's go up over the mountain.
[186:06.87]Let's do a mountain run, first of all.
[186:10.22]Second of all,
[186:33.68]It's really like playing the lottery when you do that.
[186:35.66]If you hit, it's fucking huge.
[186:36.90]It's like a million dollars.
[186:46.57]Okay, don't get stuck on the stairs here.
[187:01.21]Damn it.
[187:01.91]Oh, this is bad.
[187:11.07]How many Mordhau montages are we gonna get?
[187:12.98]Depends on how good people are.
[187:19.73]You gotta give play by play?
[187:20.89]I can't give play by play.
[187:22.55]Cause then I'll lose over and over again.
[187:25.27]Are you?
[187:39.69]He came all the way back to the spawn.
[187:45.73]Where?
[187:46.93]He's still here.
[187:48.77]I'm getting on the fucking horse.
[187:51.43]Oh my god.
[187:52.29]That guy was reading a map.
[188:05.39]Oh my goodness.
[188:18.22]That was a very quick match.
[188:29.95]Alright, I'm going to be my guy.
[188:37.80]Stop team killing me, idiots.
[188:44.52]I think I'll be alright with this.
[188:45.60]I got rocks.
[188:51.35]Okay.
[188:51.88]This is gonna be the round.
[188:54.64]This will be the round where I'm at least in the top five.
[188:56.98]I'm gonna try as hard as I can.
[188:58.46]I'm seriously going to put everything into this.
[189:04.39]Here we go.
[189:09.83]That's a cool hammer.
[189:36.78]This is the enemy spawn.
[189:42.01]You can't go down in the enemy spawn.
[189:45.91]Why?
[189:46.23]Why?
[189:49.10]It just kills you.
[190:13.43]And he's dead.
[190:13.89]I have an axe in me.
[190:18.48]I just took the axe out of my body.
[190:39.17]Oh, he killed me.
[190:41.65]I got a little too close to the teammate there, he just kind of elbowed me in the mouth.
[190:45.31]Come on.
[190:58.54]It wasn't my fault.
[191:00.98]People are gonna say it was, but it was not.
[191:27.70]Right in the window Coming up I'm gonna kick him right in the face whoever comes up here Easy don't wait wait wait don't don't don't don't don't don't wait wait don't go up there Wait for them to come up and we can we can Helms deep them
[191:43.25]Didn't you see Helm's Deep?
[191:44.23]Didn't you see the movie Lord of the Rings?
[191:46.79]Turn around, you're gonna get sniped.
[191:48.89]Turn around, he's up there right now.
[191:50.64]Look, we're gonna Helm's Deep this guy.
[192:10.50]I told you, didn't you see the movie?
[192:28.52]I told you.
[192:29.44]You gotta watch out for that shit.
[192:31.57]They ain't fucking around.
[192:32.37]They really want to get up this ladder.
[192:35.73]Can I throw their sword back at them?
[192:37.17]Who's that?
[192:37.51]Uh-oh, they're coming in the other side.
[192:41.84]I told you.
[192:43.66]Apparently I told you.
[192:44.44]I told you.
[192:44.98]I told you.
[192:45.38]I told you.
[192:55.19]Watch the back, watch it, they're gonna climb up the ladder.
[192:56.73]Helm's deep, I told you guys!
[193:00.99]You act like you've never seen any of these movies!
[193:02.53]I'm gonna start spamming voice chat as close to the mic as I can get.
[193:29.14]Well, that didn't do anything.
[193:30.55]I still don't have the drop down on how hard those rocks get thrown.
[193:37.53]Watch out, don't backswing me.
[193:39.87]I just back- okay, well he- I did what he- It's too chaotic, there's too many people on this server.
[193:49.76]He's dead?
[193:51.94]He's not dead, he's not dead, he's still alive, he's still alive!
[193:54.35]Oh wait, we both died.
[194:01.45]Where am I on the chart?
[194:03.53]I'm not even on the chart.
[194:04.77]That's how you know it's not going well.
[194:05.95]I gotta kill some more people here.
[194:07.07]Holy fuck.
[194:33.03]Kick!
[194:39.90]What?
[194:40.48]Okay.
[194:41.38]Why couldn't I kick?
[194:44.32]Okay, I can kick now.
[194:45.88]I was literally spamming this button.
[194:47.86]Did I have no stamina?
[194:56.99]Oh lord.
[195:04.98]I spent all this damage throwing rocks.
[195:06.86]Well, I did hit that guy right in the face, so it's worth it.
[195:13.54]You can't kick with a ranged weapon out.
[195:15.38]Oh, really?
[195:16.94]I didn't even know that.
[195:18.62]Good to know.
[195:23.51]Every team I'm a part of... Every team I'm a part of loses?
[195:28.45]Well, you could say that about all the other people on the team.
[195:34.23]What?
[195:43.66]They win sometimes.
[195:49.04]There's almost 64 people in this server.
[195:52.86]You're gonna put it all on the one guy that's throwing rocks?
[196:05.32]I need a better weapon than that.
[196:06.14]That thing sucks.
[196:17.95]I made him drop his lunch.
[196:30.38]Oh, come on.
[196:31.18]We were having a duel.
[196:31.84]We were having a duel.
[196:32.72]You can't.
[196:33.10]Come on.
[196:33.32]That's dishonorable.
[196:34.28]Oh, this actually is just free-for-all, isn't it?
[196:55.97]You goddamn opportunists!
[197:20.46]You can't even.
[197:21.60]You might as well swing in a circle.
[197:44.32]Who the fuck is this?
[197:45.18]Is that Colonel Sanders?
[198:02.08]Get Colonel Sanders out of here.
[198:09.65]I thought I just had a shotgun.
[198:17.49]That was my kill.
[198:24.33]Ow, ow, ow.
[198:33.66]You gonna club somebody?
[198:38.68]Nope, I'm not.
[198:39.30]There's 60 goddamn people here.
[198:50.46]Watch this.
[198:51.52]Wanna see a real dickhead move?
[198:57.35]I'm waiting for the spawn.
[199:11.38]Where did you...?
[199:30.53]Look at how far down I am, not even up there at all.
[199:48.19]Ooh, it didn't kill him?
[199:49.81]How is that possible?
[200:02.74]Get away!
[200:05.76]I just turned into it AFK AFK AFK AFK AFK AFK
[200:34.67]Come here.
[200:35.13]There he goes.
[200:37.75]See you later.
[200:41.68]There's people just in every direction.
[201:04.13]How did I end up like this?
[201:06.58]Holy shit!
[201:38.63]Uh-oh, uh-oh!
[201:41.72]Come on, I gotta get at least... This guy has 29 kills, my goodness.
[202:05.01]It's really just swing horizontally until you take off somebody's head.
[202:12.04]It's just horizontal swing until somebody's fucking head comes off.
[202:17.38]We're just trimming each other's hedges.
[202:25.29]That was fun.
[202:27.33]This game is a lot of fun.
[202:32.59]Alright, a couple more and then I want to make a new character.
[202:34.60]I want to actually buy something.
[202:46.60]Let's go red.
[202:48.12]And this time... I'm going to go Scoundrel.
[202:53.14]I like the little stab.
[202:54.20]I like the little thrusties.
[202:55.82]Like this.
[202:56.64]You just... Dash forward and...
[203:05.86]I'll test it on this guy's mouth.
[203:14.76]Here we go.
[203:16.17]Four, three, two, one.
[203:43.93]Ooh, nice block.
[203:46.05]Sorry guys, but you're all gonna burn!
[203:54.05]It's all about the dance.
[204:04.70]Oops.
[204:11.38]Oh, you...
[204:13.11]You've closed yourself in.
[204:14.87]Alright.
[204:26.54]Who's left?
[204:30.90]Guys, you... Okay, well, if you're gonna do that... See ya.
[204:39.87]Just a little.
[204:40.49]All it takes is just a little bit.
[204:49.45]Who's left?
[204:51.85]Up top?
[204:56.37]Who's this one person left?
[205:00.99]Uh... Oh, we won.
[205:09.95]Nice job!
[205:11.27]If somebody throws... Look at those Fortnite gamers in the middle.
[205:14.59]Yeah, you guys are in the wrong game.
[205:28.13]Thought he was right there.
[205:40.34]Easy.
[205:40.86]Too many, too many, too many, too many.
[205:42.24]Back it up.
[205:45.46]No, nothing I can do about that.
[205:46.70]Ah, I didn't put the trap down.
[205:51.73]Damn it.
[205:56.75]There they go.
[205:57.21]Yeah, that's too bad.
[206:12.16]It's just good to- it's a people-watching game, it really is, because this guy has no idea, and now there goes his leg, and there's his buddy, Archer2, desperately trying to fight off
[206:22.81]That guy didn't even know that there were five people around him.
[206:25.83]He found out that this many people were here not even one second ago.
[206:49.72]Getting some points there.
[206:51.52]Easy.
[206:58.08]Caught him right around the corner.
[206:59.58]You did exactly what I thought you were gonna do.
[207:01.34]Hmm, poking away.
[207:16.12]Just a little bit at a time.
[207:17.22]That's 138 damage.
[207:17.66]This guy, how much health does he have?
[207:32.47]Alright, just the archer over here.
[207:33.47]I'm gonna get accidentally hit by this.
[207:41.90]Nice swing.
[207:44.18]Just these guys over here and that should be it.
[207:45.48]I thought it was gonna spin it around.
[208:01.07]Help!
[208:01.45]Help!
[208:01.99]Guys!
[208:03.09]Guys!
[208:03.45]I don't want an unnecessary death.
[208:13.03]I need a weapon.
[208:13.96]Who has a weapon on the ground?
[208:23.82]Did we win?
[208:30.20]Uh...
[208:32.33]What's going on here?
[208:35.83]I'm not a coward.
[208:36.57]I'm just trying to play my battles correctly.
[208:39.04]Where is this person?
[208:52.81]Hey!
[208:55.23]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[209:00.17]Oh, there he is.
[209:09.85]Alright, not doing too bad this time.
[209:17.29]Right in the corner here.
[209:20.38]Right there, right when they turn around, they're not even going to see it.
[209:22.00]I want to get a good firebomb, right inside of there, right up back there.
[209:29.72]I think I got hit by, I think I got hit in the head by an arrow.
[209:43.93]Oh.
[209:45.50]A throwing axe?
[209:47.86]From where?
[209:50.04]I was inside the corridor.
[209:57.70]Look at this bullshit.
[210:03.30]This is such dog shit!
[210:07.01]Dude, go run around the other side!
[210:09.57]Run to the right, there's another opening!
[210:13.87]He wants to go in through here.
[210:16.06]See?
[210:16.24]There you go.
[210:16.56]He's like, yeah, that's a good idea.
[210:17.78]You're right.
[210:25.12]See?
[210:25.78]There you go.
[210:27.60]You got an opportunity to maybe hit the guy right in the back of the head.
[210:30.54]Alright.
[210:35.93]New.
[210:36.33]Let's do.
[210:40.03]Hmm.
[210:43.90]I don't know.
[210:47.86]Ah, shit.
[210:48.34]Didn't do it fast enough.
[211:01.39]Give me some ticks.
[211:02.07]Come on, give me some ticks.
[211:03.97]No ticks?
[211:08.86]Come on, bait him.
[211:09.60]Come on!
[211:10.90]Oh, you dick!
[211:23.80]This is bad.
[211:27.63]Shit, I'm backed all the way up here.
[211:29.67]Ooh, somebody has a loot.
[211:44.68]Alright, well let me see if I can sneak up behind one of these.
[211:46.38]No, no way.
[211:49.08]There's no real safe way to go, huh?
[211:54.54]I guess it's whoever decides to make the first mistake.
[212:00.19]Like that.
[212:00.63]Oh fuck.
[212:05.81]Oh fuck.
[212:06.25]Get him!
[212:07.05]How does this guy get in here?
[212:09.55]What the fuck?!
[212:10.72]He just climbed in here!
[212:33.45]I can't believe you got up there.
[212:34.41]You climbed all the way up.
[212:42.97]Free guard has won.
[212:46.94]Well, that's just stupid.
[212:49.42]Here we go.
[213:00.89]I'm sorry.
[213:02.23]It's not intentional.
[213:10.35]Um, did he seriously come all the way back to kill me?
[213:13.97]What the hell?
[213:17.61]He just walked in a straight line and killed me in one hit.
[213:28.82]No, I don't want to be that.
[213:30.76]I'm going back to Raider.
[213:31.90]Yeah, I know I was shooting him, but where was all my friends?
[213:41.34]Alright, let's get a good cinematic view of this.
[213:42.78]I'm following the archer.
[213:59.14]They're not your friends.
[214:01.09]We're fighting for the same thing.
[214:03.15]Our leader wants the crown.
[214:05.69]We're all on the same team.
[214:07.35]We all go to the same alehouse together.
[214:09.49]We're not friends though.
[214:10.55]How?
[214:13.68]There's like... 1500 of us.
[214:16.93]In the whole fucking city.
[214:18.67]You don't think you know everybody here?
[214:29.90]They talk about you behind your back.
[214:37.52]There's a difference between a coworker and a friend.
[214:40.56]We all probably work on the same farm!
[214:44.83]It's probably the same damn family.
[214:52.11]All these guys came from the same, like, five people.
[214:59.33]You wanna know the history of the universe?
[215:04.57]Thirty people all had sex with each other.
[215:06.65]And then, that's how we got to ten to eleven billion people.
[215:22.57]It just kept going.
[215:23.31]Alright, give me my... No, I don't... What the hell?
[215:31.77]I picked Raider, didn't I?
[215:33.04]I don't want to do Archer again.
[215:35.24]I'm not very good at it.
[215:42.96]Jeremy, I don't know what sex is.
[215:45.14]Someone will tell you eventually.
[215:58.25]Huntsman Hallway!
[216:03.91]Can I take out my cleaver?
[216:05.61]What- I- Okay, honestly.
[216:07.65]Why?
[216:08.59]I'm sitting here mashing the number 2.
[216:11.09]And it will not take it out.
[216:13.68]I'm just going 2, 2, 2- No, no, I'm not taking it out.
[216:16.06]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[216:29.63]I don't understand how sex caused 30 people to go to 7 billion.
[216:32.39]Well, 30 people created 80 people.
[216:34.37]80 people created 160.
[216:36.31]160 created 380.
[216:37.15]380 created 5,000.
[216:37.47]5,000!
[216:37.69]Those people were having a lot of sex.
[216:39.01]5,000 created 8,000.
[216:39.29]8,000 created 50,000.
[216:39.71]50,000 created 200,000.
[216:40.17]The plague happened.
[216:40.69]Minus 100,000.
[216:40.87]Those 100,000 then had to make up for it, so they made a million.
[216:56.87]Those millions spreaded across the entire Earth, and they had a bunch of sex and got it to like a billion.
[217:02.03]And that was about like 80 years ago.
[217:04.24]100 years ago.
[217:07.32]That's just how it worked.
[217:13.70]There was only a million people up until like 19... Like 18 fucking 60.
[217:17.64]There was less than like 425,000 people in the world.
[217:20.64]I'm not... Okay, I'm gonna pay attention, because...
[217:27.05]What number of person am I?
[217:27.99]Um... I'm probably like... You know what?
[217:33.69]What an interesting question.
[217:37.03]That is such an interesting question.
[217:38.23]I'm serious.
[217:39.79]What person are you?
[217:41.65]Out of the, you know, 7, 8, 9 billion, right?
[217:43.09]Like 6 billion, 254 million.
[217:44.07]That's an interesting question.
[217:56.70]Oh god.
[218:01.36]Got you.
[218:02.32]Caught you right around the corner.
[218:06.92]Gonna help you.
[218:07.89]Coming in.
[218:09.11]Oh my god!
[218:09.61]There was two!
[218:15.03]Oh, fuck.
[218:16.63]Oh god.
[218:17.41]I knew they were behind me!
[218:18.19]Oh, they're everywhere!
[218:23.98]I haven't done anything.
[218:31.21]Jerma, you know, you're on the losing team every time.
[218:33.41]That has nothing to do with the guy holding his sword in his hand in the back.
[218:40.59]Or the guy hitting him with the giant spoon.
[218:47.06]But it's my fault.
[218:49.08]It's my fault.
[218:55.27]That's the enemy team.
[219:00.25]That's the other team!
[219:01.81]Oh, well, I was on that team before.
[219:12.14]I'm just getting the fuck in there.
[219:14.30]No, I'm not.
[219:24.57]It's so fun just to whip shit.
[219:33.77]Hmm... We've got less people over here.
[219:39.62]Oh shit, too many.
[219:49.36]Oh, there's fire.
[219:50.04]Look at all the fire everywhere!
[219:52.38]Ayayay!
[219:56.83]There's too many!
[219:57.79]How did they get so many back here so quickly?
[220:05.11]It's like, seriously, there's two of them.
[220:06.88]And then they have sex, and then there's fuckin' eight, and then all of a sudden there's fuckin' fifteen, and then there's fifty standing around you!
[220:20.90]See, this is... We need you on the front lines!
[220:32.44]You're not gonna make it.
[220:33.98]You're not gonna make it.
[220:35.06]I can't believe you're making it.
[220:37.36]This should never work.
[220:39.92]The guy with the polearm has killed, I think, six people so far.
[220:54.65]Switch teams.
[220:58.29]This game is really fun.
[221:02.89]All you need to win a war is a stick with a pointy end.
[221:07.39]We need a lot of those.
[221:09.33]You need at least two to three hundred thousand of those.
[221:16.76]If we were to talk about a scenario, you know, back in the medieval times.
[221:20.92]It was... Guys, you remember war back five hundred thousand years ago?
[221:28.36]It was like maybe 80 people.
[221:31.64]It was like 60 people versus 150 people.
[221:38.16]Maybe it was like 1,000 versus 1,000 total.
[221:45.24]There weren't very many people on Earth.
[221:55.58]Somebody said, I can't listen to this anymore.
[221:58.07]Bye.
[222:07.11]What's the truth?
[222:21.48]Even people in the Roman age with 50k- I know, I'm just fucking around.
[222:47.39]You guys really don't think I thought that like 200 people fought a war back in like the medieval times, right?
[222:54.13]If you do, then I must be a pretty good actor then.
[222:56.97]And I am, so I already know that.
[223:01.57]Damn good fucking actor.
[223:22.75]If you could redo your life again with cheat codes, what would you put on?
[223:28.36]I don't know.
[223:31.00]I could snap my fingers and get a meatball sub.
[223:35.12]That's pretty handy.
[223:37.08]I don't want to fly or any of that bullshit.
[223:54.11]Let's go... Let's go back to the... Try this guy again.
[224:05.87]Well, I stumbled.
[224:21.45]Ooh!
[224:22.13]Who's dead?
[224:22.77]Both.
[224:27.20]Are you really... You know, I'm just gonna leave you alone.
[224:30.92]Because you really want to... You really want to get that done.
[224:58.35]I'm protecting them right now.
[224:59.89]No, I'm getting out of here.
[225:11.75]Watch that overswing.
[225:12.93]Watch that overswing.
[225:13.97]Oh, I thought I was going to get killed by the guy behind him.
[225:30.32]I had a straight going there.
[225:31.10]That wasn't bad.
[225:37.53]What?
[225:39.27]What?
[225:40.85]From behind?
[225:41.31]Hmm.
[225:44.33]I think someone came up behind me.
[225:55.16]Oh, he came out of nowhere again.
[225:58.91]Is blocking directional automatic?
[226:00.39]It is not.
[226:04.06]It's right click.
[226:06.90]Really, I just blew it.
[226:19.21]Faked him out.
[226:21.23]Ooh, he's got a little streak going, doesn't he?
[226:45.49]Come on, where am I at?
[226:46.13]14?
[226:46.41]The highest is 24.
[226:50.43]That's not gonna happen, I don't think.
[227:09.43]Fuck, from behind again.
[227:11.58]I gotta go back against the wall.
[227:16.93]I just got back.
[227:17.45]Did Jerma make this in Dreams?
[227:20.15]Yeah.
[227:32.70]They'll be behind me, right?
[227:36.74]I tried to fake him out.
[227:37.78]Didn't work.
[227:43.56]Watch out.
[227:44.06]Watch out.
[227:44.60]Always to black against wall.
[228:00.14]Fuck, everyone just keeps coming in.
[228:01.40]It's like the WWF!
[228:04.40]I'm in the ring and the keep- interference just keeps happening.
[228:06.76]Alright, I'll take top five.
[228:09.52]That's the first time it's happened.
[228:18.45]Only 280 gold?
[228:18.93]I feel like I deserve more than that.
[228:26.79]I kind of just want to keep playing.
[228:27.87]This is- I'm just having a good time.
[228:36.99]I'm gonna get to level 3.
[228:45.06]Actually fun game in 2019.
[228:46.42]Yeah, it's just kind of fun to play.
[228:54.32]I didn't think I was gonna be this entertained by it, but I am.
[228:57.06]Let me try this guy again.
[228:59.41]So this dude...
[229:03.17]It's a big, heavy... evening star.
[229:07.12]So you really want to just try to club people in ahead with this.
[229:11.10]What about, does it change it?
[229:12.10]I can't change the... Okay, I can change it... into a... Hold it closer.
[229:22.33]So this is, I guess, short range, or...?
[229:27.53]Let's see what it does.
[229:31.01]Oh, there's so many coming.
[229:33.54]What else do I got?
[229:34.14]Nothing.
[229:34.64]There, that's too many.
[229:45.19]Dammit.
[229:46.83]Alright.
[229:50.05]Shit, I thought he was gonna...
[230:02.54]Damn, I'm trying to fake him out.
[230:05.40]I'm starting to do that more often.
[230:06.38]That's actually a really good tactic.
[230:07.66]You do the stab, and then people try to block it, but then you come in with an overhead.
[230:14.22]It's very, very effective.
[230:15.26]I gotta do that more often.
[230:17.32]I'm getting a little better.
[230:18.34]I'm starting to understand mechanics and opportunity and stuff like that.
[230:22.94]And stuff like that.
[230:27.91]Alright, well, not when there's this many.
[230:36.96]Come on, get me back, back, back, back, back.
[230:38.08]I got an assist somehow.
[230:50.04]Alright, I want to go down here.
[230:52.37]I'm more useful when I can get him like a one-on-one or a one-on-two scenario.
[230:56.19]Like this.
[230:56.61]Like that.
[231:04.59]Yeah.
[231:05.51]Alright, come on, bring it on.
[231:10.78]He blocked all of that somehow.
[231:13.99]This magic shield.
[231:18.66]Look at this guy.
[231:19.60]Wow.
[231:38.46]Damn it.
[231:38.88]I was doing so well.
[231:39.64]Come on.
[231:39.96]I'm still doing alright.
[231:44.62]That was me.
[231:45.78]No, it was me.
[231:59.51]Fuck.
[232:00.21]God damn it.
[232:14.91]Alright, good.
[232:16.41]This guy's trapped in here.
[232:17.45]Alright, move up.
[232:21.12]Nice team damage.
[232:22.12]I know.
[232:23.24]I'm trying.
[232:25.82]I'll take a medic bag, though.
[232:40.68]Get out of here!
[232:41.86]He's just laughing with all of his dinner.
[232:43.54]Are they even attacking me?
[232:49.33]How did they all get back here?
[233:16.47]You gotta be kidding me.
[233:18.93]That dude seriously went around in a full circle.
[233:41.91]I really...
[233:46.12]Oh, he was behind me.
[233:59.93]That's not our horse, right?
[234:05.31]That is enemy horse dead ahead.
[234:15.45]Alright, here we go.
[234:21.19]How did that not hit him?
[234:22.63]Alright.
[234:31.06]Jeez.
[234:36.16]Missed.
[234:42.26]Did you really just duck that?
[235:06.69]We've got ourselves a gamer here!
[235:23.34]I didn't do anything.
[235:23.92]I just watched him die.
[235:29.17]Can you please stop losing?
[235:30.27]My son is watching.
[235:31.73]Son's not old enough to watch this game.
[235:34.79]I'm sorry, he just doesn't...
[235:53.44]Is the game still in development?
[235:54.72]I don't think so.
[235:56.10]I think they're gonna keep adding stuff, right?
[235:58.60]But is it early?
[235:59.80]I don't think it's early access.
[236:01.71]Is it?
[236:03.77]My son is 35.
[236:05.31]Well, then that changes everything.
[236:18.36]Onward we go!
[236:24.18]A little chip damage, it's all good.
[236:34.80]Alright, don't hurt each other.
[236:35.82]I know it's easier said than done, but... Open the door!
[236:47.07]Open the door!
[236:48.23]Open this door right now!
[236:49.57]Can we get an axe guy to break the door open, please?
[236:55.95]Axe!
[236:56.41]Kick door open!
[236:57.27]Somebody open this door!
[236:59.69]Open the door!
[237:04.11]I'll reach in there!
[237:09.83]Alright!
[237:10.49]Okay!
[237:11.26]Okay!
[237:11.96]God damn it!
[237:15.18]This was planned!
[237:16.84]This was a planned thing!
[237:18.24]I hope you guys are having fun!
[237:30.58]The ol' door-stuck-guy-wraps-around trick.
[237:48.08]Stop opening the door, my son is in there.
[237:52.66]So?
[237:56.40]We share this castle.
[237:57.86]And your son's like 40.
[238:04.92]In fact, what's he doing here?
[238:06.04]Is this my castle?
[238:17.00]Yeah, that's like, that's the stables down there.
[238:19.11]He's hanging out in the stables.
[238:20.19]He's not supposed to be down there.
[238:22.01]After four o'clock, you know that already.
[238:26.17]We've got some really great shit in the chatroom there.
[238:28.21]Somebody said, I actually eat poopoo, poopoo peepee.
[238:31.80]I'm talking about, like, top of the line chat box stuff going on in there.
[238:38.09]So, you know, that's great.
[238:43.51]I'm not getting door baited again.
[238:45.19]That's not gonna happen.
[238:46.33]I'm going down here.
[238:47.11]Are you serious?
[238:54.16]Like, what the fuck are you doing?
[239:15.55]Oh, I bled out.
[239:23.77]Jeremy, I think you're projecting.
[239:31.07]This one person, the guy with the pregnant girlfriend, is the only person on the team that's doing anything.
[239:38.01]Look at the rest of us.
[239:38.77]That guy's worth four people.
[239:49.34]I want to see what's going on in here.
[239:50.52]I'm actually, I'm curious.
[239:52.03]Am I banned from going in here?
[239:54.45]Even as a ghost, I can't go in here.
[240:12.32]Ah, he almost walked into it.
[240:16.09]Alright, I need to get at least one or two kills.
[240:17.97]I have to.
[240:18.96]I can't just set it to zero.
[240:25.52]Watch the back.
[240:27.74]They like to come around there.
[240:28.92]I can do that too.
[240:58.27]Thank you.
[241:05.99]Didn't get it off first.
[241:07.61]Thought I did.
[241:13.64]Close the door.
[241:18.34]This is bad.
[241:18.82]There's going to be a reason why we're not supposed to be going up here.
[241:21.50]And there's the reason right there.
[241:29.54]Alright, okay, I got him once.
[241:32.28]Easy, easy, don't get piled up here.
[241:34.75]This is gonna be a disaster.
[241:45.94]Watch out, behind, behind, behind, behind, behind, behind!
[241:58.06]Oh God, oh God, we're surrounded.
[242:00.33]You can go... Whoa, no, no, no, no.
[242:07.81]Oh, that guy... Oh my God.
[242:19.38]Oh, there's too many.
[242:25.99]Oh.
[242:33.45]I couldn't see what was behind me.
[242:36.25]Ugh.
[242:44.95]Coward, how would you... I was trying to be tactical.
[242:57.70]Watch out, he's gonna get around us!
[243:01.89]He's dead.
[243:07.79]Didn't hit anybody.
[243:08.43]How?
[243:09.75]Kick him off.
[243:13.47]Just a bunch of... Oh god, please.
[243:23.22]I just got sniped.
[243:24.44]Not by a stream.
[243:25.88]But by an arrow.
[243:34.28]Just watching the guy go down.
[243:38.00]I didn't have any health left.
[243:39.18]Of course I'm gonna die from that.
[243:44.22]Fire be- Yeah, it was behind me.
[243:45.64]I only- I had like 15 health left.
[243:53.38]I'm gonna play that.
[244:00.33]Maybe when he was getting better- Well, look at- Okay.
[244:02.99]Look at the team.
[244:08.03]I'm technically in fourth place on the team.
[244:13.74]I'm just giving you facts here.
[244:30.81]Without making it political, pee or poo?
[244:33.19]Both at the same time.
[244:35.71]Does that make you happy?
[244:47.34]What?
[244:48.02]Somebody pushed me into the fucking thing!
[244:52.16]I got wedged in!
[244:59.69]Why?
[245:00.95]No!
[245:03.39]Give me a break!
[245:05.89]Why is that even there?
[245:07.41]There's fucking 40 fucking people in the spawn!
[245:13.41]And somebody was just like, Sergeant Kidd, excuse me, get out of my way, we're out there.
[245:23.86]I was standing right here, and it was like, ah, eh, ah, eh, eh.
[245:30.98]What the fuck?
[245:33.32]Flip it, I want to see it.
[245:34.56]Somebody watch it.
[245:49.93]I think you need to adjust the difficulty.
[245:52.77]Well, now I'm not in fucking fourth place anymore because I don't even get to play this one.
[245:58.98]Did the Sonic movie trailer haunt your day?
[246:00.76]Yeah, I mean, I don't know why they even make that movie.
[246:10.36]Super Mario Brothers even knows to stay the fuck away from film.
[246:28.59]There is a Mario movie.
[246:29.61]Yeah, and it's widely seen as one of the worst movies ever made.
[246:33.29]That shouldn't be a barometer there.
[246:38.19]Alright, make sure you don't get pushed.
[246:49.44]Watch this.
[246:55.37]Go ahead, open the door.
[246:56.75]Come on, somebody walk out there.
[247:00.03]Dude, the one time... Do it.
[247:09.18]I'm going this way.
[247:17.19]He's dead, right?
[247:17.99]He's dead.
[247:19.15]He better be.
[247:20.09]He's not dead.
[247:30.36]There's so many people right there.
[247:36.88]Are we really doing this again?
[247:47.05]Watch this right side.
[247:48.17]They're retreating.
[247:56.32]That means they don't have very much health.
[248:04.03]Again!
[248:04.25]Nice.
[248:09.65]Good work.
[248:17.23]See ya.
[248:18.19]Okay, good.
[248:19.77]Who's left?
[248:20.23]This is not a good battle cry.
[248:30.10]See, look, I've climbed all the way back up.
[248:37.53]17 kills.
[248:41.01]Don't fall down.
[248:43.11]See?
[248:43.39]He almost just did.
[248:43.99]See?
[248:44.23]He did.
[248:45.23]Look.
[248:46.25]He did.
[248:48.31]He fell all the way down.
[248:52.23]He did.
[249:11.80]I'm gonna do the... How am I hitting a teammate there?
[249:20.35]Well, now you gotta get down.
[249:21.15]Fuck.
[249:25.35]No!
[249:26.43]What the hell was I doing?
[249:28.19]No!
[249:33.64]Why did I do that?
[249:36.02]I got a kill for it, but I lit, like, two of my teammates on fire.
[249:39.40]Fuck!
[249:49.84]The person that made the Minions movie is making a Mario movie.
[249:56.17]It's hard to do a Mario movie, though.
[250:00.01]Because, just by its very nature, Mario doesn't talk.
[250:04.31]I know he did.
[250:04.93]I know there was the Mario Super Show and all that shit.
[250:07.57]But if it's a cartoon, like 3D animation, Mario doesn't really talk.
[250:16.23]Is it just going to be Mario is no dialog?
[250:22.80]Yeah, a Mario movie is way harder than a Sonic movie because Sonic never shuts the fuck up.
[250:30.08]Half of Sonic the Hedgehog's appeal is he talks really loudly.
[250:34.55]And all the time.
[250:36.91]So... Mario doesn't really do that.
[250:40.49]I mean, maybe Luigi, but Luigi... They've made the characters over the years...
[250:45.25]Very, very simple language.
[250:48.15]Really easy to understand.
[250:49.45]You know, like, oh-ho!
[250:51.33]Oh, bingo!
[250:52.77]Right?
[250:53.09]Like, how do you make a whole movie of that?
[250:58.18]Their dialog is all in Mario Kart.
[251:04.72]I'm dead.
[251:07.05]Now I've...
[251:19.45]What do I want to play with here?
[251:21.03]I need to get some more items and armor and shit.
[251:26.95]They did minions.
[251:27.79]Yeah, but... Are the minions... I mean, I've never seen the movie or anything, but... Do the, uh... I don't think I've even played once with Knight.
[251:39.28]Aren't there other people that are in those movies that talk for the minions, essentially?
[251:43.50]They're the ones that are there to kind of experience the world with you, in a way?
[251:50.71]Or do the minions just... It's just absolutely... You can't understand anything.
[251:58.51]Peach can talk.
[251:59.17]Yeah, I mean, but you need a character that is gonna have most of the dialog.
[252:04.24]Unless they're really gonna make Mario... Fully voice-acted dialog line.
[252:11.28]I mean, Charles Martinet, right?
[252:13.38]He's still doing it.
[252:14.28]Is he still doing it?
[252:21.39]I wonder if he would just do it.
[252:28.81]You see, he was doing it for a very, very long time.
[252:37.93]Fully voice-acted Wario in the last WarioWare game.
[252:41.71]I'm all for it!
[252:42.35]I'm all for the attempt, right?
[252:49.54]But having a protagonist that doesn't really speak, that was beautiful.
[252:53.90]Hit him in the face with a hammer.
[252:57.40]He's gonna get away with that.
[253:02.02]Just one blacksmith versus an army.
[253:12.51]He has a voice actor.
[253:13.43]Yeah, but he doesn't really... Mario doesn't have a fully scripted dialog.
[253:19.82]He has phrases.
[253:27.84]I'm gonna put a bear trap down, like, right here.
[253:31.85]Right at the top of the stairs.
[253:48.05]Die!
[253:51.13]Did he not die?
[253:52.24]I'm surprised by that.
[253:57.56]He did die.
[253:58.38]He fell for a very very very long time.
[254:08.87]Did he not die?
[254:09.79]No, he did.
[254:20.28]Use the loot?
[254:23.16]I'm so useless with this character.
[254:24.82]In a little bit.
[254:25.54]Not right now.
[254:31.63]Oh, somebody went in the bear trap.
[254:32.61]Okay.
[254:33.11]That makes more sense, doesn't it?
[254:43.70]At least show the action, Jeremy.
[254:45.84]Come on.
[255:00.29]Are you the last one standing?
[255:01.37]I think there are two red archers left.
[255:11.14]Scary.
[255:16.82]Almost.
[255:18.80]Very close.
[255:23.25]Is he dropping them from above?
[255:26.38]Aww, bear trap.
[255:28.49]Not cool.
[255:29.67]Not cool.
[255:42.19]Oh well.
[255:43.61]We tried.
[255:49.05]Alright, I'm a knight.
[255:52.46]I've never played as the knight.
[255:56.86]Let me string together two or three.
[255:58.52]I just want two.
[255:59.74]Two per round is good.
[256:02.87]If it's even possible, it is.
[256:04.05]But I don't like this map with this many people.
[256:17.81]Blocked it.
[256:24.85]Right in the head.
[256:27.63]Keep that.
[256:28.21]That guy needs one hit and he's dead.
[256:31.39]We got more than them.
[256:32.03]We got more.
[256:32.51]Go in.
[256:32.93]Go, go, go, go in.
[256:33.95]Let's go.
[256:34.38]No, no, no, no, no.
[256:50.25]I'm in the fighting area.
[256:50.89]What are you talking about?
[257:02.11]Oh, fuck.
[257:03.16]Oh, fuck.
[257:03.56]Oh, fuck.
[257:07.64]No.
[257:10.28]What?
[257:11.20]That was... This is bad.
[257:13.30]I'm in trouble.
[257:14.63]Oh, well.
[257:27.94]Are they gonna vote kick me?
[257:29.10]Well, then... they don't get to play anymore!
[257:32.40]Because I'll go to a different server, it's that simple!
[257:46.72]The vote kick is real.
[257:56.61]They can play without you.
[258:00.07]You don't think they're going to do that, do you?
[258:04.37]Do you really believe that?
[258:22.59]Do you really think?
[258:25.95]The guy that taunts every time and runs through everybody to come find me is gonna play on a different server.
[258:32.60]Do you really think that?
[258:34.36]Hey, don't fall!
[258:51.33]Do you really- do you really thunk that?
[259:10.01]Oh, this is a bad place to be.
[259:10.95]I don't want to be here.
[259:20.32]Uh-oh.
[259:27.96]Too many!
[259:31.73]Oh, fuck!
[259:32.31]Too many!
[259:32.79]No!
[259:57.64]Are they playing door pong?
[260:03.36]Let's see how this ends.
[260:04.80]How is this gonna end?
[260:11.43]It ends with, like, the squire killing both of them.
[260:13.75]Watch.
[260:17.63]Whoops.
[260:17.91]I don't even know what that was.
[260:29.18]This game is fucking ridiculous.
[260:33.84]That was, uh... I don't know.
[260:41.30]Oh, it's a Davos!
[260:42.54]Get him, Davos!
[261:05.30]Does Jerima only read your messages out loud if you insult him?
[261:07.56]Yes!
[261:11.81]Look at all that- That team had like 40 combined stream sniper kills on me.
[261:15.67]They were only killing me.
[261:17.41]I was the only person to die.
[261:18.95]Notice everybody on my team had 0 deaths and I had 48 deaths?
[261:22.63]That's unfair!
[261:23.51]It shouldn't be like that!
[261:24.21]Alright, wha- I need to level up.
[261:32.32]Why am I not getting any more- Did I- Did XP turn off again?
[261:43.74]Jerma, you are a badass.
[261:45.24]Hey, thanks.
[261:46.22]That wasn't a mean comment.
[261:47.10]I read it all up.
[261:51.60]Try getting more kills than deaths.
[261:53.80]I have, like, 12 kills.
[261:55.62]And 48 deaths.
[262:09.81]This is so much fun, though.
[262:11.03]It really is.
[262:14.22]I'm just going to pretend that I'm Ned Stark and this is ice.
[262:28.97]Oops.
[262:30.31]I thought I was still on the... Okay.
[262:32.32]Well, Ned Stark did... I may have... Oh!
[262:43.74]I thought I- last game was- ayayay.
[262:49.05]Ned Stark died immediately.
[263:09.88]Dammit, I thought I was gonna be faster.
[263:20.00]Yeah, he wouldn't have been in this show for very long.
[263:34.83]NOOOOOO!
[263:41.54]Somebody kill him!
[264:01.72]God damn it!
[264:13.12]Is somebody behind?
[264:13.90]Oh.
[264:16.81]Can you guess who that was?
[264:19.27]I wonder how many of my deaths have been to that guy.
[264:22.65]It's gotta be at least like 30.
[264:35.89]I'm going over here.
[264:43.53]Kill!
[264:44.05]Wait, give me that.
[265:06.39]Can I pull the arrow out?
[265:09.13]I can.
[265:10.49]Uh-oh, guy on a horse.
[265:29.20]Whoa!
[265:30.02]Uh-oh.
[265:39.01]No?
[265:39.21]I'm reconnected?
[265:41.07]I think I'm back.
[265:48.69]What's my favorite movie?
[265:50.23]That's a tough one.
[265:50.83]Ghostbusters or Gremlins 2.
[265:55.65]That's a toss-up though.
[265:56.51]It's hard.
[266:14.17]Nice.
[266:14.61]Good.
[266:14.99]Keep it going.
[266:26.51]Holy shit!
[266:28.23]Whoa!
[266:28.81]Too many people!
[266:30.39]Oh!
[266:30.49]You heard it's Back to the Future?
[266:36.25]That's a good one, too.
[266:38.97]There's a lot of good movies.
[266:42.36]There really are.
[267:09.83]Everyone's fighting this, like, pen over here.
[267:21.43]Horizontal strike.
[267:22.43]Right in the... Never mind.
[267:27.86]Aww.
[267:34.46]Kill the archers.
[267:35.42]That's a good... You know, I'm gonna run around.
[267:37.18]I'll try to wrap around and kill all archers.
[267:43.14]I'll be on archer duty.
[267:44.04]There's an archer!
[268:01.75]We lost?
[268:03.43]That's sad.
[268:12.92]I'll kill the people that can't fight back.
[268:14.36]What do you mean?
[268:14.76]They've been fighting the whole time, shooting arrows at me.
[268:21.53]Experience.
[268:22.01]Come on, more.
[268:25.15]No.
[268:27.99]Why does it have to be shut off?
[268:28.83]Alright, I'm going to take a look at what I got.
[268:30.59]Because I have money.
[268:31.22]Let me go see what I have here.
[268:34.52]I should be like with eight or something by now.
[268:44.45]Let's go down here.
[268:45.09]How much money do I have?
[268:48.17]Why am I not making any money?
[268:53.42]I have not gotten any experience points and no money.
[268:56.16]Did they turn it on and then turn it off again?
[268:57.58]Because it was working for about 15 minutes.
[269:03.76]Damn it.
[269:04.32]Oh well.
[269:07.33]Alright, let's go somewhere else.
[269:12.69]Play the tutorial for cash.
[269:14.81]I tried that last time, but I'm assuming it's not going to work again.
[269:19.02]Because if the servers are not keeping up with what you're doing, it probably won't work.
[269:24.90]So, no, it's all good.
[269:26.58]We'll just join another one.
[269:27.42]Alright.
[269:29.36]Something a little more low scale.
[269:34.80]Like this.
[269:36.31]Never mind.
[269:36.65]This is called Very Horrible Place.
[269:38.25]I don't think I want to do that.
[269:40.35]Team Deathmatch.
[269:40.87]Here we go.
[269:50.85]Alright.
[269:52.01]Let's go try the knight again.
[269:57.69]Real gamers don't care about cosmetics or currency.
[270:02.07]Well, you have to when it involves buying new weapons that you can use in the game.
[270:08.13]What are you going to do?
[270:13.46]What are you going to do?
[270:14.48]Punch me?
[270:14.78]Are you going to TK me?
[270:21.64]Alright, let's go.
[270:35.89]I don't even know how the fuck I wrapped around you like this.
[270:40.63]Kill?
[270:42.67]Is it bleeding?
[270:44.05]Uh, okay.
[270:59.04]Delete OBS.
[271:02.67]Alright.
[271:13.81]I'll show up behind you!
[271:17.32]That was what I would consider a bop.
[271:27.22]What?! !
[271:29.37]What ha- Did I jump directly into them?
[271:34.11]That's the f- Okay, I've been playing this game for almost four and a half hours.
[271:38.45]And... I've touched those spikes before and it didn't instantly kill me.
[272:04.47]Uh-oh.
[272:05.57]No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[272:12.93]I jumped face-first into them.
[272:14.63]I thought they were just kind of there to be an annoyance.
[272:17.02]I didn't know that you died if you touched him instantly.
[272:19.24]It's the first time I've seen him work.
[272:30.33]You killed him.
[272:32.54]Alright, I'm going.
[272:33.58]The bridge is just death.
[272:34.54]They're all pile up on the bridge.
[272:35.82]Wow, I... Is there anybody even around?
[272:50.57]What the fuck?
[272:57.74]I guess they've been behind me.
[273:04.24]Keep going down.
[273:14.86]Through the hole.
[273:15.50]Come on.
[273:18.89]Right in the head.
[273:20.19]I can't get that.
[273:30.65]Get his loot.
[273:44.70]Stab.
[273:45.70]There it is.
[273:46.50]Alright, keep it up.
[274:03.33]Rock.
[274:08.05]Didn't think I was gonna turn, did ya?
[274:18.26]Nice!
[274:26.29]That guy dead?
[274:30.87]Not yet.
[274:36.20]Oh, great.
[274:37.64]Well, oh well.
[274:40.24]That was a good, spicy team attack.
[274:42.28]They were pretty good.
[274:47.81]That guy looks like the ref.
[274:48.97]I wonder if they... Imagine if they had refs back then.
[275:01.70]Alright, don't touch those.
[275:02.82]They're bad.
[275:06.38]They did have a ref back then.
[275:09.32]No, they didn't.
[275:20.71]Alright, the guy throwing the shit at me has gotta go.
[275:29.24]I'm gonna drop down, I know it.
[275:36.81]What do I have left?
[275:43.93]One, two, three!
[275:48.80]Well, that was dumb.
[275:50.20]I didn't even click.
[275:51.19]I didn't even click.
[275:51.83]I swear, I promise you.
[275:52.83]I didn't click.
[275:53.33]The guy with the fucking frying pan!
[276:18.08]There's only so many times I can block the fucking attacks!
[276:30.45]I got looted, I did.
[276:37.45]Oh, that guy got in the way.
[276:47.28]This guy's fucking relentless.
[276:48.70]They're behind me, right?
[277:05.00]Goodbye.
[277:05.72]He didn't see me in his peripheral, but I did.
[277:30.37]Oh, good.
[277:31.59]Very good.
[277:33.61]MVP.
[277:34.53]Took his legs out.
[277:50.10]Good work.
[277:51.88]This is working like a team.
[277:53.08]This is what it should look like.
[278:01.82]Nooo!
[278:08.32]I'm going to bed now, can I get a good night, yeah?
[278:14.96]Good night.
[278:26.56]I was going to do it right into the microphone, but it's getting later, I don't want to do that.
[278:33.26]The referee got too close to the combat.
[278:43.43]Watch it.
[278:44.07]He's gonna... I knew you were gonna do that.
[278:45.67]Is this the end of my first battle?
[279:08.39]Uh-oh, friend.
[279:09.07]An annoying friend!
[279:12.67]I'm dead.
[279:20.67]Friendly friend.
[279:21.57]Did I... Did I tap the button?
[279:23.11]I think I might.
[279:33.00]Riposte?
[279:33.54]Isn't that what I'm doing?
[279:37.85]It's like right after you swing, right?
[279:39.25]After you block?
[279:41.77]Like that?
[279:42.17]That's... I think I've been doing that.
[279:51.32]Ow.
[279:59.12]They even tried turning the... Yeah, but I'm... It's kind of... My brain just wants to kill things.
[280:11.09]I thought he wasn't going to pay attention to that.
[280:22.66]Come on in.
[280:23.32]Oh, he's got the bow, doesn't he?
[280:26.48]See ya.
[280:30.20]Damn it.
[280:31.38]Get the ref.
[280:41.29]Ooh, I missed.
[280:43.21]Wow!
[280:44.33]What did I hit him with?
[280:46.76]I didn't hit him in the back of the head?
[280:47.94]That was interesting.
[280:56.69]Eventually we're gonna have a fight.
[281:42.52]I can't have 13.
[281:43.16]That's unlucky.
[281:44.84]Seven minutes left.
[281:53.86]Fire!
[282:06.24]I didn't get him.
[282:10.04]Watch out behind.
[282:20.05]The combo.
[282:23.25]Nice cross.
[282:32.15]Holy shit.
[282:33.47]Oh, I think I...
[282:35.99]Come on, I can't have 13 kills.
[282:37.57]14 at least, or 15.
[282:38.03]Is the game out now?
[282:42.24]Oh yeah.
[282:43.36]You can buy it right now.
[282:44.86]Should be on the front page.
[282:57.24]Hey, we did it!
[282:57.90]I'm not on the losing team this time.
[283:02.25]Yeah, as of right now, the game is released, but it's kind of broken.
[283:06.57]Progression is turned off.
[283:09.03]The currency is turned off.
[283:11.73]The game works.
[283:12.47]Some of the servers have issues.
[283:20.95]Damn it.
[283:23.33]Re, uh, turn it back on, turn it off, turn it on?
[283:25.77]Will that work?
[283:33.47]The game itself is a blast.
[283:34.57]Oh yeah, no, it's awesome.
[283:38.01]I wouldn't be playing it for this long if I didn't think it was great.
[283:40.59]I've been playing for like five hours.
[283:42.15]I think it's fantastic.
[283:45.49]Who do I want to be?
[283:46.13]Hmm.
[284:04.60]I don't know.
[284:12.83]Alright, let's go.
[284:16.36]The protector of the realm.
[284:27.94]Are you behind me hitting me?
[284:32.49]Fuck.
[284:33.37]Too many.
[284:34.13]There's a lot.
[284:35.41]No, no way.
[284:39.71]Too many.
[284:45.72]Oh, this is not... Okay, this is just respawning and keep going.
[284:52.22]He's right ahead.
[284:59.08]Damn, they're like all the way back at our spawn.
[285:00.46]Let's try the spear.
[285:08.15]Actually try to use it this time.
[285:16.99]Get help.
[285:28.02]Oh, this is bad.
[285:32.84]I got a long weapon, man.
[285:34.04]I could stay up here for a while.
[285:41.59]God damn it.
[285:50.96]It's not doing this.
[286:17.54]Ow!
[286:19.99]We're getting so badly smoked right now.
[286:34.91]Where'd you come from?
[286:35.63]Alright, I gotta be somebody else.
[286:38.53]We just can't even leave our spawn.
[286:52.22]Damn it leave me alone Nobody on my team has more than three kills
[287:30.44]Kicking is good, but when there's three or four people around you, you can't really do it.
[287:55.40]No!
[287:56.24]Dammit!
[287:57.12]Ah!
[288:02.85]Ahhhh!
[288:20.88]Hehehehe!
[288:21.66]Hehehehe!
[288:23.28]Me too too!
[288:48.79]There's no fighting them!
[289:02.06]Finally, one ant came out too far out of the nest.
[289:06.94]We got him.
[289:09.78]Our shitty ant colony finally killed one ant.
[289:32.09]Yeah!
[289:34.61]Laugh at that!
[289:40.45]You son of a bitch!
[289:43.61]I got him!
[289:59.85]Oops, I'm sorry.
[290:00.43]I didn't mean to do that.
[290:01.35]I was trying to... I'm sorry.
[290:02.43]I didn't mean to.
[290:03.25]I'm trying to do it again.
[290:13.28]I'm trying to get that fucking guy up again.
[290:15.30]Ha ha ha.
[290:16.68]Ha ha ha.
[290:31.14]Do you ever press X then 2?
[290:49.58]Why is that a thing?
[290:51.62]What?
[290:53.34]I accidentally hit my own buddy in the face.
[291:22.35]Oh my God.
[291:30.71]No, no, no, no, no!
[291:49.34]Kill, kill.
[291:52.44]Oh, hello, sir!
[292:05.91]Zero health.
[292:07.45]Almost.
[292:07.81]I'm just getting fucking destroyed.
[292:11.73]I wanna kick more people off the edge.
[292:19.69]No!
[292:28.43]I got it!
[292:28.91]Plus one!
[292:30.08]One damage!
[292:44.47]It took like five people.
[293:00.17]What the fuck?
[293:00.93]Oh my god, my... Oh my god.
[293:02.89]Oh my god, what do I do?
[293:17.19]Alright, I wanna try... I wanna try the actual VR again.
[293:22.23]I wanna see if I can actually do it.
[293:23.75]Is it... Can we do it?
[293:45.52]This is where it begins.
[293:46.60]I gotta pee too.
[293:49.73]I haven't peed once today, have I?
[294:01.04]No, I haven't.
[294:13.24]That's a first.
[294:14.38]I don't think I've done that in a long time.
[294:18.86]It's been a while since I've not had to pee for like five hours.
[294:26.09]I did pee right before the stream started, though.
[294:30.43]Should I go pee right now?
[294:32.25]Okay, I'm gonna go pee... I'm gonna go as fast as I can.
[294:34.01]I'm gonna get some water.
[294:36.61]I'll be right back.
[294:38.47]Hopefully, by the time I get back in here...
[294:43.90]We'll see.
[294:44.42]Alright, I'll be right back.
[294:48.78]Okay, bye.
[297:15.33]Did I get in?
[297:47.07]No, I'm still looking.
[297:51.11]Really?
[297:55.65]This would be fun.
[298:00.09]Quick drawing does not work.
[298:03.95]Well, that's unfortunate.
[298:10.26]Sometimes it takes up to 10 minutes to find a match.
[298:15.64]Is it just because they're all full?
[298:18.10]And a ton of people are trying to join at the same time.
[298:22.68]This has been okay recently.
[298:30.59]Ah, you can't select Battle Royale.
[298:33.15]I see.
[298:38.42]Well, shit.
[298:46.07]alright let's go server where do we want to go five out of six that's a little one maybe we should do a little one this is horde horde would be fun with a actual five or six people you know
[299:17.33]His Battle Royale right here.
[299:18.41]Can I just join this?
[299:24.13]I guess so.
[299:30.36]Interesting.
[299:32.94]I think so.
[299:34.18]Hide the server browser?
[299:46.21]Yeah, but there's really nothing you can do about it.
[299:50.27]Because, I mean, it's not that hard.
[299:52.25]In an attempt of me to hide the server... I mean, how many VR games are currently running right now, you know?
[299:59.50]It wouldn't be that difficult to find it.
[300:06.64]Hi-yah!
[300:17.61]This might even be the only Battle Royale server that's on, like, US West that has players accepting it, so it's like, hey, I'm in PR!
[300:27.04]Unless matchmaking works, that's not gonna happen.
[300:33.10]Life is bald.
[300:37.64]Old guy versus young guy, who do you think?
[300:40.94]I think young guy's gonna pull through.
[300:43.28]Old guy has the upper hand now, but I think young guy's gonna throw a few punches here and dunk him out with one hit.
[300:47.82]I'm commentating!
[300:48.68]You don't come attack the guy broadcasting the game!
[300:52.36]I'm broadcasting the fight!
[300:53.62]Why would you punch me in the face?
[301:00.34]You punched the ref.
[301:01.24]No, not even the ref.
[301:01.96]I'm the guy with the microphone in the ring that wants an interview.
[301:10.51]Can you die by that?
[301:13.19]Quick quick quick!
[301:13.71]Three, two, one!
[301:16.15]Alright, I need something.
[301:23.95]Oh, come on.
[301:24.39]Anything.
[301:25.67]Can I pick the horse up?
[301:27.23]Can I get a horse?
[301:28.19]Weapon.
[301:29.06]Chest.
[301:32.30]Alright, I got a maul and a branch.
[301:34.30]And a mace.
[301:35.46]That's a lot.
[301:36.90]No, don't use the branch.
[301:37.64]Use the maul.
[301:49.86]My game environment is being compromised!
[302:15.39]My game environment is being toyed with!
[302:22.50]Alright, I'll... This ain't gonna last for more than 15 seconds, I hope you know that.
[303:03.51]This gamer gunk is in my gamer zone!
[303:15.27]Alright, here we go.
[303:26.84]Nobody can know who I am now.
[303:42.79]Is this free-for-all?
[303:45.69]I think so.
[304:03.93]Damn it!
[304:31.73]What?!
[304:39.38]Packet loss.
[304:40.16]Packet loss.
[304:51.93]Ooh, that's far.
[304:52.57]Someone's gonna come behind me, aren't they?
[305:02.40]Damn it, I was so paranoid about somebody being behind me.
[305:09.35]I don't know if it's Raider anymore.
[305:10.63]I think I was having more... Gamer fatigue also is probably settling in here.
[305:27.71]Right in the head.
[305:29.55]There's a naked guy.
[305:31.97]Come on.
[305:34.08]Come on, give me one of these.
[305:35.10]Game of fucking fatigue, man.
[305:39.64]I just wasn't... I just had the one zone I was going.
[305:44.58]Good, I wanted to do that, because now I can play the class I want to play with.
[305:56.87]Turned all the way around.
[306:15.17]So watch the stamina.
[306:29.70]Ooh!
[306:31.70]Two!
[306:41.05]Stamina. 100%.
[306:45.19]Don't tell him I'm behind him.
[306:48.13]Ooh, speaking of which... Aww, damn it.
[307:00.63]Okay, that's not gonna kill me, right?
[307:13.40]CHAAAAN!
[307:21.11]Somebody behind you!
[307:21.77]Somebody behind you!
[307:24.27]That was not honorable.
[307:26.07]Although I do it all the time.
[307:38.43]Wow, that hurt.
[307:43.40]He outplayed me there.
[307:44.28]I was gonna debate.
[307:46.08]I was gonna debate him.
[307:50.35]No, do your thing, do your thing.
[307:51.91]I won't get involved.
[308:17.47]Are we playing a game or are we having a picnic, fellas?
[308:26.50]He blocked it.
[308:27.32]Oh, he's stuck.
[308:30.04]Okay.
[308:32.38]Well, let's help him.
[308:38.31]Did I die by the... Oh, by... Darth Maul killed me?
[308:51.29]Didn't think I was gonna do that.
[308:52.40]Do you like that move?
[308:53.34]I call that one the 1v1 lock-on technique.
[308:56.52]Ready?
[308:56.74]Thanks for the- thanks for the fan-tate.
[309:18.15]Oh, that was fucking ridiculous.
[309:31.45]Ooh, fuck!
[309:31.93]I forgot you had those!
[309:49.36]I can't... I can't block with a band-aid?
[309:51.39]What the hell am I thinking?
[309:54.91]I'm trying to block with band-aids in my hand.
[309:58.60]It's made of a cloth.
[309:59.44]I'm not sure you're aware of that, Jeremy.
[310:29.36]Oh, he's back.
[310:44.65]Ooh, good fake!
[310:48.07]No!
[310:54.11]The new De-Groot Keep looks really good!
[310:58.87]The game is really fun.
[311:10.64]And I just got... I aggroed both of them by doing that.
[311:27.24]Aww.
[311:32.23]1v1?
[311:32.81]Wait, am I... It just says deathmatch.
[311:34.61]Wait, am I ruining everything?
[311:42.65]Other people are doing that to me, though.
[311:44.95]Wait, everybody is doing that to each other.
[311:50.73]Wait, hold on.
[311:53.01]I've been attacked from behind like five times.
[311:55.57]It's because I started it?
[311:57.81]That's not what happened, right?
[312:00.07]I'm not the bad guy here, am I?
[312:04.15]See?
[312:04.63]Look!
[312:11.07]Look, it said that!
[312:12.17]1v1 server.
[312:13.09]Yeah, okay.
[312:16.82]I didn't... If that's... No way.
[312:23.88]They didn't learn it from me.
[312:24.90]This server's been running for like four days.
[312:30.57]Look, I'm observing right now.
[312:31.93]They're all just fighting each other.
[312:34.68]They're just wildly swinging at each other.
[312:36.42]That guy's got double frying pan.
[312:48.69]I'm not listening to you guys about that.
[312:50.21]Uh-uh.
[312:53.87]It's just a fight-each-other server.
[312:55.54]It's not about 1v1ing.
[313:05.53]Ooh, that was a big hit.
[313:09.37]This is an RP server?
[313:10.87]I'm doing it wrong.
[313:26.47]Ooh, alright.
[313:33.95]Oh, I blooded that.
[313:34.67]Fuck.
[313:35.81]He beat me!
[313:42.10]That didn't just spawn right there, did it?
[313:47.65]It's okay, I made it.
[313:48.53]I made it to the fray.
[314:10.44]Where is he?
[314:12.00]What the hell was that?
[314:14.82]He like tripped over a few things.
[314:36.19]Nice!
[314:38.67]Ooh, here he is.
[314:41.47]He doesn't have a sword!
[314:42.47]Wha- Nice!
[315:12.81]Ooh!
[315:13.75]Wait, no, I'm alive!
[315:21.30]I got a Coke ad?
[315:22.30]Oh, I'm sorry.
[315:23.20]Unless you don't, unless you like Coke, I don't know, whatever.
[315:34.20]Can I get a...
[315:47.31]Oh, that's... This game is fucking so funny.
[315:54.31]Oh, he didn't even know.
[315:57.42]I'm just gonna wait for it to happen.
[316:12.30]I don't even care if I didn't get the kill.
[316:26.99]Ooh, watch out!
[316:37.74]Ooh, that was a double bait!
[316:46.06]Holy shit, did you actually hit that?
[316:52.65]Fuck, too early!
[316:53.81]I'm taking him down with me!
[317:00.53]He's got three pans.
[317:01.57]Alright, you and me.
[317:09.48]Let's do it.
[317:12.06]Honorable.
[317:12.52]We'll do it honorably.
[317:33.48]Oh, he's, like, spinning.
[317:34.21]He's doing, like, a weird thing where he's... Oh, God.
[317:35.49]I'm dead.
[317:37.25]No, don't fuck this up!
[317:39.29]He was, like, turning his back all the way.
[317:42.53]He was going like this.
[317:43.23]It was weird.
[317:43.53]It's, like, throwing you off.
[317:44.49]He goes, like, and then wraps around.
[317:46.70]He, like, spins his back this way and then turns.
[317:49.54]That's a pretty good tactic.
[318:06.69]Alright.
[318:07.68]Rematch.
[318:36.09]Good job.
[318:38.95]This bin doesn't do anything.
[318:39.93]It's just a little awfully... I wish I could make some money.
[318:47.83]The worst part about this is not being able to unlock more weapons.
[318:53.26]But I'll do... I'll do like another two or three matches.
[318:59.74]And then tomorrow we'll do...
[319:03.88]relaunch the game.
[319:04.62]I did that before and it only worked for, like, five minutes.
[319:11.22]Ow.
[319:14.69]So we'll probably... What we'll do tomorrow... We'll finish Salmon Max Season 1 tomorrow.
[319:18.67]That's probably what will happen.
[319:25.51]Because it was... It's about, like, five or six hours, right?
[319:35.96]Alright, same thing.
[319:37.49]How do I 1v1 with him?
[319:38.27]Ooh, head.
[320:06.77]He dropped a bandage for you?
[320:07.93]Is that what happened?
[320:08.59]Am I... No, stop this.
[320:19.54]Why am I doing this?
[320:29.59]Gun game would actually be pretty cool here.
[320:31.15]If they started you off with, like, the little potato knife.
[320:39.30]Be the guy with the frying pan?
[320:40.24]I can't.
[320:40.94]I don't have a frying pan.
[320:47.07]Are you ready?
[320:47.49]Do we have to do this honorably?
[320:49.85]Are we doing this?
[320:50.85]Who's doing this?
[320:53.87]Wait, wait, wait.
[320:54.23]You both can't just come at the same time.
[320:57.48]Oh, no!
[321:02.20]Hey!
[321:02.98]That's me from an hour ago.
[321:05.60]I honorably would have...
[321:07.93]You want a 1v1?
[321:08.39]Is that what you want?
[321:09.77]Is that what you want so bad?
[321:18.86]I don't want to fight you.
[321:19.70]You're like so good at the game.
[321:25.15]What do you want me to do?
[321:26.91]How many hours do you have in this game?
[321:29.39]How many days have you been out?
[321:30.19]You've been playing all day?
[321:46.83]Aim for the legs.
[321:56.52]Dragging's the reason I didn't get into chivalry, F. This feels slower than chivalry, though.
[322:02.16]This feels... Chivalry was a little quicker, I think.
[322:06.66]From what I remember.
[322:13.65]I don't know when to go in.
[322:14.71]I think I'm going in now.
[322:36.09]Got panned.
[322:37.43]Yeah, I gotta take a break too.
[322:39.07]I've been playing for too long.
[322:47.10]It's kind of blending together like it usually does.
[322:51.12]Ugh.
[323:10.86]I guess I'll do Pan guy version 2.
[323:17.78]I didn't expect to kill that guy instantly.
[323:19.24]They died on top of each other.
[323:32.11]I didn't think that was gonna happen.
[323:33.53]Alright, another guy with a pan?
[323:34.79]Are we doing pan 3?
[323:37.35]Okay, pan 3.
[323:38.69]No, this is not pan 3.
[323:58.87]How long is this map?
[323:59.87]Oh.
[324:05.63]Alright, short sword, let me try it.
[324:08.21]Oh, fuck.
[324:13.22]I thought for some reason that guy was going to come from behind.
[324:30.95]Who?
[324:31.22]Who's coming in?
[324:31.98]You?
[324:32.18]Let's go.
[325:07.21]You fight with dishonor!
[325:17.17]Fuck that.
[325:27.04]Alright.
[325:29.34]I think I gotta take a break from this game.
[325:30.84]I need a mental break from five and a half hours straight of swinging swords at people.
[325:43.94]Um, we'll probably just hang out.
[325:47.36]We'll hang out for like a half an hour.
[325:51.40]Just chill.
[325:54.22]And then tomorrow, I'm gonna bring you... Uh, Sam & Max.
[326:01.51]Episode 3.
[326:03.01]We're in the middle of it, so we're gonna finish it.
[326:14.66]Will I stream Mordhau again?
[326:15.94]Uh, once it works.
[326:18.60]Completely.
[326:21.46]I'd probably jump in here with some friends and do the, uh... The Horde mode.
[326:26.84]Because there really is only so much... No progression.
[326:31.02]That, um... And, like, buggy servers, not being able to do matchmaking.
[326:39.08]You know.
[326:41.54]So, uh, I am going to...
[326:44.57]say goodbye for now for those of you that wanted to watch uh this game but for those of you sticking around I'm just gonna chill we'll just hang out probably do the bits too just hanging out talking about stuff
[327:09.24]And I'll see you tomorrow if you're leaving for Salmon Max Episode 3.
[327:12.94]And probably Episode 4 and Episode 5.
[327:16.30]Would you recommend this game?
[327:17.24]Oh yeah, definitely.
[327:20.32]Once all the bugs and everything are ironed out, this is going to be a great game.
[327:23.94]I mean, it already is a great game, so... Yes.
[327:27.35]Definitely.
[327:32.63]I'm going to get one more water, though.
[327:36.11]I'm sweating in here.
[327:38.49]Give me one second while I get a water.
[327:41.60]And we'll come back and just chill.
[327:43.72]See you very soon.
[327:45.03]Goodbye.
[331:17.15]What can I just put on the screen while we hang out and do the bits?
[331:28.38]I don't know.
[331:28.84]Oh no, no GeoGuessr.
[331:38.47]No GeoGuessr tonight.
[331:45.57]Maybe we will just do the bits and call it.
[331:50.61]That'll be just probably at about six hours.
[331:52.61]That's fine.
[331:53.99]That's good.
[332:01.11]And we'll start tomorrow.
[332:05.23]I really do want to set up that personality test.
[332:07.53]I'm going to try to get that done.
[332:08.69]There's like two or three things that I really want to get done here.
[332:16.12]But I'll see you tomorrow.
[332:17.04]Don't worry.
[332:24.07]Drink more water.
[332:27.75]Actually, I drink a lot of water now.
[332:29.59]Since moving to Vegas.
[332:34.21]Yeah, Labo VR is on the table too.
[332:37.47]There's a lot of random stuff to do.
[332:48.27]Yeah, we might as well just... Let's do the bits in Hangout.
[332:53.28]This will take us to about six hours.
[332:54.66]I'm gonna grab some food and... We'll go tomorrow.
[333:05.14]Poor Far Cry.
[333:06.08]Oh no, Far Cry.
[333:07.12]I forgot about Far Cry.
[333:09.86]Instead of Jerma lied about certain things, you should just do Jerma forgot about certain things.
[333:16.81]That actually is way more accurate.
[333:19.37]Jerma forgot about Far Cry.
[333:21.99]Jerma forgot about... Sam & Max.
[333:25.51]Jerma forgot about Minecraft.
[333:29.48]Jerma forgot about Dragon's Dogma.
[333:31.24]There you go, you got it.
[333:36.18]Jerma Lite is more click-baity.
[333:38.85]Yeah, it kind of is, isn't it?
[333:40.87]But, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[333:42.43]We'll go back to about six hours ago.
[333:45.87]To Lewis with six bucks.
[333:48.25]Six hours ago, six dollars from Lewis.
[333:51.13]They just say hi.
[333:53.41]Thank you, Lewis.
[333:55.45]For the six bucks.
[333:57.25]We had 15 community subs from Squirds that I missed.
[334:02.30]I was very focused in the first couple hours of the stream.
[334:05.02]And I think it would be an Etalyx of trying to get in a lobby and stuff, and it just wasn't working.
[334:09.74]But thank you so much for the 15 community subs.
[334:16.14]It's a lot.
[334:16.98]Thank you.
[334:24.44]When's the next big stream event?
[334:26.76]Hopefully soon.
[334:30.04]Because I started working on something very in particular that I've talked about recently.
[334:35.90]It should be a blast.
[334:41.08]The pieces all have to come together, though.
[334:42.48]I don't think that'll be more than another month.
[334:45.16]It'll be within the next 30 days.
[334:48.96]No, not green screen, too.
[334:51.52]Something a little more weird.
[334:58.21]Hopefully it works.
[335:03.53]But, peaceful Haley, thanks for the $2.50.
[335:05.97]Hey, Jerma, how was your vacation?
[335:08.37]It was good.
[335:09.52]Hope all's well.
[335:10.18]I auditioned for something recently and I felt really confident.
[335:14.29]I had it in my head that I was going to get it, but I found out today that I didn't get casted.
[335:18.57]Hurts my feelings a lot, but I guess this is just what I have to go through till I get casted.
[335:23.11]Guess it just sucks because I really, really, I really felt confident.
[335:26.03]I don't usually feel that way.
[335:27.93]Maybe I didn't do as well as I thought.
[335:30.67]Well, I think you're approaching it the wrong way.
[335:33.94]I'll tell you exactly why.
[335:37.12]Because every single role that you audition for is not a role that you kind of have to look at it like,
[335:47.46]Audition for a bunch of stuff.
[335:49.84]And if you get one of them, great.
[335:52.58]But if you get attached to a role before you even have a part in it, you know, you'd be like, oh shit, I really wanted that fucking part.
[336:02.55]I really wanted to do that.
[336:04.23]I wanted to do that.
[336:05.33]It should be me, right?
[336:06.19]You get kind of...
[336:07.62]stuck in there.
[336:09.00]But the way to combat that is to just keep auditioning for things, and then by the time, you know, you audition for another three, four, five things, the thing you auditioned for earlier, you're not even gonna care about it anymore.
[336:23.42]Also, it can take... It can take a while for anything like that to even happen.
[336:32.29]You know?
[336:33.49]Casting and acting and...
[336:36.73]It's a tough business.
[336:38.69]Because there's a lot of people also doing it too.
[336:44.29]So view it like a regular job process.
[336:45.99]Yeah, I mean, that's what it is.
[336:49.49]When you send an audition tape in, or if you put in an application to a job, they're kind of the same thing.
[337:00.56]Maybe they didn't think that you were right for it.
[337:02.06]That happens all the time.
[337:12.90]You talk like you used to be an actor.
[337:16.58]Well, I mean, I've been in a few things.
[337:22.32]And I have like demo tapes and reels and stuff.
[337:25.83]I've done all kinds of stuff like that before.
[337:29.07]Not even professionally either.
[337:30.29]Like this is all stuff from years ago.
[337:33.07]I used to do that instead of doing YouTube videos.
[337:36.15]It was what I did.
[337:36.75]I just did it online.
[337:43.08]Send a tape?
[337:47.86]The best advice that I can give with that is... Do not go into auditions thinking you're going to get the part.
[337:58.59]You should go into auditions thinking that you have an opportunity to and a chance to, and you're in that with everybody else.
[338:08.54]So you should try to rise above everybody else because you know that it's not certain.
[338:15.28]So try to do a better job than everybody else, right?
[338:21.87]But I wish you luck.
[338:26.37]Punch away at a few more auditions, see what happens.
[338:30.18]You're never going to know what happens unless you try it.
[338:38.02]But thank you for the $2.50.
[338:39.64]Appreciate it.
[338:43.98]My name is Peaf.
[338:45.80]Gave $10.
[338:46.06]Thanks for the $10.
[338:48.46]They say pass the ale.
[338:52.45]Thanks for the $10.
[338:59.41]Thank you.
[339:00.77]I don't know what that's from, but...
[339:05.50]Maybe I do, maybe I've heard it before.
[339:07.80]But I appreciate the $10.
[339:08.80]Thank you.
[339:09.48]My name is Peef.
[339:11.42]What do you mean?
[339:12.78]What are you talking about?
[339:13.86]Passes off his dreams?
[339:32.12]Jerma's a lazy boy.
[339:33.26]Oh, dreams.
[339:35.32]Oh, his actual... Okay, I see.
[339:38.24]I see where you're going here.
[339:43.32]Chunky Baloney, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[339:44.98]Don't listen to them, Jerma.
[339:46.00]I love your boomer techniques.
[339:49.77]I know, I know.
[339:52.35]I was doing alright, okay?
[339:57.96]I was doing okay.
[339:59.72]And it's not about how good I'm playing, it's about how much fun I'm having.
[340:02.42]Don't you understand?
[340:03.26]Hope you guys understand that.
[340:12.36]Fun, jermaDisgust.
[340:14.16]No fun allowed.
[340:19.16]Does this streamer have a dog?
[340:20.24]Yes, this streamer does.
[340:21.92]It's a dachshund mix.
[340:24.28]His name is Otto.
[340:25.32]He's a very good dog.
[340:26.67]Great dog, actually.
[340:31.04]Thank you, Ixion Games, for the $5.50.
[340:34.91]One of my rats is sick, and since you're the Jerm-a-rat guy, I figured I'd throw positive vibes into the universe in your direction.
[340:40.81]Thanks for the laughs.
[340:43.34]Hopefully, your rat is okay.
[340:47.42]I'm sorry to hear that.
[340:52.91]Thank you for hanging out.
[340:56.73]Otto is in bed right now with Kim.
[341:03.53]But I wish your rat a swift recovery.
[341:08.04]Hopefully they're okay.
[341:14.14]Otto waiting room.
[341:19.46]Otto waiting room.
[341:20.45]You've seen him before.
[341:24.29]Hey, thank you too!
[341:26.71]Zoro, Carlos, and it's an ASCII art.
[341:32.31]I don't know what this is.
[341:33.23]It looks like the first half or first third of an ASCII art.
[341:36.68]I don't know what it is.
[341:40.76]The only ASCII arts that I know of, I only know of two.
[341:46.10]And one of them is Mario Shitting and the Gnome.
[341:52.47]I don't know any other ASCII's.
[341:53.73]I don't think there are any.
[342:04.94]I've never, I just go, oh, there it is, there's like that fucking, oh, there it is, cool.
[342:11.07]There's like Mario, like, shitting or whatever he's doing.
[342:14.07]I'm like, oh, alright.
[342:17.91]No other ASCII art exists.
[342:27.10]I thought he was pissing.
[342:28.02]I don't know, it gets deleted so fast, I don't even know what it is.
[342:32.83]It's on there for a tenth of a second and it's just gone.
[342:36.56]Look, I'm not going to go to Google and be like, what's that ASCII art where Mario's naked and pooing?
[342:42.90]Why would I ever do that?
[342:52.61]That's not something that I want to go look up for any reason.
[343:01.53]If only you had a Chrome extension that could let you see deleted messages.
[343:04.37]I don't want to see deleted messages.
[343:05.79]They're deleted for a reason.
[343:09.11]Curiosity killed the cat, man.
[343:10.63]I don't want to open up, like, a virus website.
[343:20.05]But thank you, Zorro Carlos, for the top half of I'm not sure what it is.
[343:23.07]But thank you.
[343:26.17]Snooze and cough to the... I have BTTV.
[343:29.18]Snoozycopter, thanks for the 250.
[343:30.14]Hey, I just want to say thank you for showing me that Dreams exists.
[343:33.86]I was a huge LittleBigPlanet fan.
[343:35.64]I never knew this game was in development until you first mentioned it some time ago.
[343:39.50]Can't wait for the insane shit people make.
[343:41.54]You could have played the tutorials on stream, by the way.
[343:44.21]They're much more fun and interactive than the first introductory tutorial.
[343:47.61]Would have been nice learning along with you.
[343:49.87]Whatever, looking forward to it regardless.
[343:53.45]No, I thought about it, but... There's two sides to that coin, right?
[344:02.80]The first side is... just... play the game and do all the tutorials and sit there for three, four, five hours and just do the tutorials and just enjoy the game.
[344:15.03]But for like a stream and like a broadcast sense, a live video sense, I don't know if I want that stream just because... That other side of the coin.
[344:29.48]The first side is great.
[344:30.80]We do it all the time.
[344:31.84]Just hanging out and playing a game.
[344:35.56]But still, I... Remember, I only stream like three or four days a week.
[344:42.17]Sometimes, maybe... I mean, it depends on the week, right?
[344:45.27]Maybe, like, four times.
[344:47.04]Maybe five, maybe, if something's going on.
[344:50.70]So, I kind of... I want all the streams that happen to have something... At least something significant to happen.
[345:00.12]Now, not every stream has to be, like, crazy, but... If I'm given the opportunity to, like, play Dreams, and stream the tutorial for one of my streams during the week, or...
[345:11.80]check out more of the content that's available to watch.
[345:14.42]I'll do that one first, right?
[345:19.26]That's not to say that I don't just hang out and play a game sometimes.
[345:22.56]I did that tonight.
[345:25.26]But playing this game and throwing axes at people in these giant battles, I think is more engaging than simply just doing tutorials for five hours.
[345:35.42]So that's kind of the deal.
[345:47.39]Nothing will compare to Trevor crying at farting noises.
[345:51.17]I don't think I'll ever be able to see him or do something like that again.
[345:54.48]That was just that stupid and ridiculous.
[345:58.66]You did a seven hour stream on that dumb newspaper game.
[346:01.52]Newspaper game.
[346:04.84]But also, I mean, I don't have a certain thing that I do every time.
[346:12.07]Picross?
[346:12.49]Picross is great.
[346:20.98]I decide what I'm going to stream.
[346:23.20]Usually, if it's not something that's a big elaborate plan, usually that week I decide, hey, what's coming out?
[346:29.29]What's out now?
[346:29.95]What do I want to try?
[346:30.77]That looks like fun.
[346:31.55]No, no, I don't want to do that.
[346:35.03]So if during the week, hey, I'm going to play Sam and Max tomorrow.
[346:38.17]That's just what I'm going to do.
[346:39.31]I'm going to play Picross tomorrow, right?
[346:45.42]That is what it is.
[346:47.02]But I do appreciate that.
[346:47.84]Thank you so much, SnoozingCopter.
[346:50.84]I can't wait to see what people come up with in Dreams.
[346:52.32]I'm gonna try to make at least a few things that are worth showing.
[346:55.24]Maybe.
[346:55.56]We'll find out.
[346:59.68]Freudian Weapon.
[347:00.30]Thanks for the 250.
[347:00.72]Uh, no message.
[347:02.84]They just say, uh, Bleed Purple bonus.
[347:06.14]Is there, like, a bit bonus going on or something?
[347:08.70]But thank you.
[347:11.24]Sawdust Bunnies.
[347:11.94]Thanks for the 360.
[347:14.83]Bonus 36.
[347:15.75]Thank you.
[347:17.39]So there is a bit bonus going on.
[347:18.91]Cool.
[347:20.75]Thank you, guys.
[347:23.17]We got Tingy for 250.
[347:24.07]Thank you, Tingy.
[347:24.67]Oh, fuck.
[347:25.01]Okay, yeah.
[347:26.21]I did not... I forgot what I said three hours ago.
[347:50.17]God damn it.
[348:00.35]Thank you, Tingy, for the 250.
[348:03.30]Deep fried Gundam.
[348:04.28]Thanks for the six bucks.
[348:07.54]$6 from Deep Fried Gundam.
[348:08.62]Wow, I can't believe it's been two years since I subbed to you, Jermbo.
[348:11.52]Anyways, just wanted to let you know how much you've helped me these past couple years.
[348:14.62]Dealing with some crazy anxiety pretty much all my life and your streams and videos have helped me totally forget about it.
[348:19.92]Even if it's just for a couple minutes.
[348:22.04]So from the absolute bottom of my heart, thank you so much.
[348:26.66]It's my pleasure.
[348:27.26]Thank you, Deep Fried Gundam.
[348:32.89]I'm really happy that you enjoy the streams.
[348:34.51]I'm really happy you enjoy the videos and
[348:39.25]Thank you for being subscribed for two years.
[348:44.95]That means a lot.
[348:45.65]Thank you.
[348:46.61]That's a fucking long time.
[348:52.46]I wish you the best.
[348:54.16]Thank you so much, dude.
[348:57.74]You got a great name, too.
[349:01.27]Thank you for peeing?
[349:07.81]What?
[349:08.45]Alright.
[349:08.99]What is the pee-poo obsession?
[349:13.13]The pee-pee-poo-poo thing?
[349:15.05]Why is there- what is that?
[349:25.40]But is- okay, but is that from something in particular, or is it just... Just- it's just so stupid that it's funny.
[349:33.60]I mean, I can get it.
[349:35.90]I said that.
[349:36.48]Did I say that before?
[349:45.34]No, I didn't make that up.
[349:47.84]Somebody just typed it one day on the internet, and then people started typing it again.
[349:50.87]And you keep encouraging it.
[349:54.07]Whatever, I hope you have fun.
[349:56.65]As long as you're having fun, I hope you're having fun.
[349:58.26]Remember the guys that were building the Fortnite and Minecraft base in the game?
[350:02.16]I hope you're having fun.
[350:12.41]Sounded like you- Oh, it's- Instead of being, it sounded like you said peeing, I see.
[350:15.63]That would be pretty wild.
[350:17.49]Imagine a game where you had to- You had to like- No, it wouldn't even have to be- It'd just be like procreation, like cells or something.
[350:45.15]This should be like a Cell first-person shooter, where you have to spread out and... Does it exist?
[351:01.25]No, not like Spore.
[351:05.14]I guess this is Agar.io.
[351:07.42]That game does already exist, never mind.
[351:13.11]Hey, Dr. Pepper, thanks for the $20.
[351:15.91]20 bucks from Dr. Pepper.
[351:18.39]Dermamovie when?
[351:21.35]Dermamovie when?
[351:26.54]Um, I have some ideas.
[351:30.00]We'll see if they end up coming to fruition or not.
[351:41.45]I have a few things that should happen before the summer is over.
[351:47.38]There should be at least two or three elaborate streams that happen before summer's end.
[351:56.25]I don't know why they wouldn't happen.
[352:04.19]But thank you, Dr. Pepper, for the $22.
[352:05.47]Appreciate it.
[352:10.30]Hawkeye of mine, thanks for the $15.
[352:11.94]Would this convince you to use the loot for a couple of rounds?
[352:14.32]I beg you.
[352:15.12]I beg of you as a bard.
[352:19.57]I used it for a couple of rounds.
[352:21.45]I just don't... didn't like the building.
[352:26.47]With coordination, that would work very well with the team.
[352:30.87]But I just want to just lash at people and laugh at rocks being thrown.
[352:36.32]When's the next Labo stream?
[352:37.64]That Labo stream is going to be... Are you ready?
[352:40.92]The Nintendo Labo stream is going to be on Saturday.
[352:54.92]Saturday, the 4th of May.
[353:01.20]Maybe I'll have a few glasses of wine.
[353:06.46]Maybe I'll break something in my room.
[353:08.93]Probably not.
[353:13.77]I'm gonna be dressed as Darth Vader because it's Star Wars day Why do they say that no I have to do that Don't do that get a sound effects lightsaber boy that have anything to do with the lab Oh And have the Darth Vader voice on the whole stream I
[353:45.86]uh no I uh nobody will everyone will hate it everybody hated Bugleberry because he couldn't understand a word he was saying you think that'll happen on the labo we'll see he wanted to do it but he's blaming us no I'm saying that's stupid enough for I think where I think it's funny that I wouldn't want to
[354:17.71]Maybe.
[354:18.07]I'll at least wear a Star Wars t-shirt.
[354:21.01]Is that enough?
[354:26.65]Fucking Bugleberry.
[354:35.88]Bugleberry should do haunted house reviews.
[354:41.34]When it gets to be that time of year.
[354:47.20]Yeah, that sounds like fun.
[354:49.78]Do IRL haunted house reviews.
[354:53.44]And the camera goes through with him and he's criticizing things and talking about how scary things are.
[355:13.31]Eagleberry should be put in a retirement home.
[355:14.95]He's not that old.
[355:15.95]He's like 41.
[355:16.41]Why do you think he's that old?
[355:21.03]He's like 6 or 7 years older than I am.
[355:29.76]But, thank you to Ert.
[355:32.24]Ert110 for the $5.
[355:33.86]Are you serious about community dream stuff?
[355:36.96]If so, can we have a submission date?
[355:40.21]Yeah, I would say let's...
[355:43.12]To make it for real.
[355:46.11]Right, because somebody was saying, like, five or six days might not be long enough.
[355:50.23]Let's say... Well, remember, it's not a submission deadline, right?
[355:58.99]Because I'm not compiling them.
[356:00.51]What would happen is we would... Let me look this up, because I want to make sure this is possible.
[356:05.62]Have a tag or a searchable title tag or something where we can get a playlist or something like that.
[356:11.50]So it'll be easy for me to just type in the word Jerma and have that just, I can find them from there or from a hashtag.
[356:21.31]Let me see if that's even possible because this currently is the Dreams Early Access program.
[356:28.43]So all these features might not exist yet.
[356:30.61]Let me figure that out.
[356:33.95]But it would be at least a week from now.
[356:42.01]But yes, I am serious about that because I want to make stuff in it too.
[356:45.81]At least movies or a short video or a little game or something or a painting.
[356:50.47]I want to at least make something.
[356:52.05]I've been waiting for that game for a long time.
[356:56.10]Hey, Mr. Comcast, thanks for the $5.
[356:58.51]Hey, Jerma, John Comcast here.
[357:00.83]Just letting you know that we here at Comcast have forgotten about you.
[357:04.67]Have not forgotten about you.
[357:06.73]I personally caress a picture of your face every night before bed.
[357:10.89]But anyway, yeah, just calling to let you know what we're about, we're still around.
[357:15.86]You know, if that cock stuff doesn't work out for you, also ignore that guy that comes to your house every morning, trying to break one of your windows with a brick.
[357:23.88]My aim is pretty bad, so you shouldn't have to worry about it much.
[357:31.54]Well, but why, John Comcast, why do you say you're calling me?
[357:36.50]Just calling to let you know we're still around.
[357:38.36]This is a text.
[357:41.40]Just calling to let you know.
[357:43.78]A weird, creepy ex-Comcast.
[357:50.33]Well, Comcast, I'm sorry, but I have moved on.
[357:53.57]You should too.
[357:56.03]And let's get the credits rolling here.
[357:59.43]Thank you everybody that played.
[358:00.63]If you jumped in.
[358:01.67]If you jumped in and stream sniped me and killed me over and over again.
[358:06.52]Thank you for playing.
[358:10.02]No.
[358:10.90]I'm kidding.
[358:14.28]Thanks for playing.
[358:15.24]That game's a lot of fun.
[358:16.09]I'll probably see you again.
[358:20.03]Made Jeremiah mad.
[358:24.95]Oh, fucking streep sniping.
[358:31.93]Hey, as long as you're having fun, right?
[358:35.03]I need to have a... A permanent defender with a shield.
[358:39.99]That just gets in the fucking way when somebody runs across the map to try to kill me.
[358:45.83]I need someone just to always be looking for that.
[358:47.62]I need to have my own personal shield butler.
[358:59.40]A spy statue.
[359:05.54]Like a bodyguard?
[359:06.66]Yeah, a shield butler.
[359:10.05]A bodyguard.
[359:11.42]You get it.
[359:12.88]I'm gonna have a bodyguard next time.
[359:14.22]I'm gonna make sure it's somebody that's real fucking good at the game, too.
[359:16.50]You know, I might even hire that guy.
[359:22.14]I might hire the guy.
[359:23.22]You know how, like, sometimes people, like, you, like, hack something?
[359:28.47]The hacker gets in and fucks up a bunch of stuff, and, like, the employees get a hold of him, and they're like, oh, hold on a second here.
[359:34.09]We want to hire you to fix our infrastructure.
[359:36.69]And they're like, what?
[359:37.37]Fucking okay.
[359:37.81]Okay.
[359:40.97]Well, maybe that'll be the defender.
[359:56.52]And then I kick him off the cliff and exit the server.
[360:07.65]I make him defend me for like 30 minutes, and then I'm like, alright man, high five, and I go and just off the fucking edge.
[360:18.13]And I point down and I go, that's what you get for crossing me!
[360:21.32]That's what you get for crossing me!
[360:25.58]And by this point, I have a full fucking hood up.
[360:28.90]And my skin is starting to turn like blue.
[360:30.87]Blue.
[360:40.80]No, not green, blue.
[360:48.74]Anyways, let's get the credits rolling.
[360:49.90]I'll see you guys tomorrow for Sam & Max.
[360:51.96]And then, this weekend, we'll do the Labo.
[360:54.90]And then, probably in a couple weeks, maybe a little bit more, we'll fucking try to dunk me in a tank and see if anybody can do it.
[361:01.33]If you didn't hear about that stream, that's the next... Somebody asked, what's the next big project?
[361:06.69]It's that.
[361:07.57]That's going to happen.
[361:09.38]I'm going to do whatever it takes to make that happen.
[361:11.16]Twitch controls robot to try to dunk Jerma that makes fun of you.
[361:18.82]There's the next project.
[361:21.12]People need to know that it's going to potentially happen because the stream just can't turn on with controls.
[361:35.47]Jerma's going to get hypothermia.
[361:37.69]It's going to be like 115 degrees in Las Vegas during that stream.
[361:47.60]Hypothermia.
[361:50.46]It's gonna be f- it's gonna be f- you guys aren't even gonna be able to do it.
[361:55.04]I don't think that you guys are gonna be able to do it.
[361:59.48]I'll be sitting there, taunting you.
[362:04.87]Why does the sauce say next week?
[362:07.55]Does it?
[362:07.89]Ne- next Wednesday!
[362:15.33]N- uh, well it's definitely tomorrow.
[362:19.36]See you next week.
[362:20.68]I'm taking another week off, guys.
[362:22.73]Man, my mother decided she was gonna come back.
[362:26.95]See you in a week.
[362:29.87]No, uh, hold on.
[362:31.27]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[362:32.57]Ready?
[362:34.73]Let's run those credits.
[362:39.61]Thank you for all the resubs and all the new subs, all the everybody that decides to support this channel for $5 every single month.
[362:47.85]You guys keep the wheels turning forever.
[362:52.85]Anybody that contributes a cent to this channel.
[362:56.45]You're the battery that powers the vehicle to drive on the road.
[363:01.03]So, thank you.
[363:07.45]And let me edit that command.
[363:08.52]Commands...
[363:25.93]It's wed nest day, right?
[363:29.65]Wed nest day.
[363:30.81]Wed nest day.
[363:33.80]Weird way to say that.
[363:45.24]That should be good.
[363:48.13]Hey!
[363:51.51]We also had one more bit come in from Jack.
[363:55.68]Jack.
[363:57.58]Jet Island.
[363:59.26]Sorry, you froze me.
[363:59.98]Jet Island.
[364:00.66]Thanks for the $2.50.
[364:03.53]Yeah, VR.
[364:04.65]There's two games I need to complete in VR.
[364:06.59]I need to do Goron.
[364:09.93]I'm gonna be honest with you though, man.
[364:13.23]That shit killed me.
[364:14.99]I don't know what it is.
[364:16.17]Something about the last week of doing VR.
[364:19.41]I did like three or four days in a row or something of VR and it fucking killed me.
[364:25.93]More so than ever before, so I had to take a break.
[364:28.11]I had to box it up for a little while.
[364:31.59]Gork VR?
[364:48.28]What do you mean it killed you?
[364:50.20]It just drained me so much that I couldn't do anything.
[364:52.86]I could barely get up the next day.
[365:00.24]I got up, but I was just... I was decrepit.
[365:07.26]VR hangover.
[365:08.16]I think that's a real thing.
[365:16.73]That's my life.
[365:17.87]Yeah, I know.
[365:23.17]VR hangovers every day.
[365:29.25]Imagine what VR will be like in five years.
[365:30.95]I don't think there'll be a headset.
[365:31.93]Remember when the 3DS came out and everyone was like, that's not possible.
[365:36.46]How does it work?
[365:39.12]I'm not wearing stereoscopic 3D glasses right now.
[365:43.06]How can I see 3D without having 3D glasses?
[365:47.23]That type of technology was just out of this world.
[365:50.43]It was impossible.
[365:55.61]There'll be a technology that comes around over the next decade where you don't have to have that headset on.
[366:02.15]You're not even gonna have to have a TV.
[366:05.08]You'll have a little dome that just projects onto a wall or into your living room or something.
[366:11.78]Everyone will just put on glasses and sit back in a chair wherever they're sitting and there'll be no television.
[366:19.08]We'll all be watching the same thing but through glasses.
[366:25.06]or through a new type of media that is made up.
[366:30.18]That shit's not gonna happen, by the way.
[366:32.54]I don't think it is.
[366:33.08]I think we've plateaued in the electronic department.
[366:37.69]And I know I'm gonna be one of those people that's quoted here a hundred years in the future.
[366:41.69]Remember when all the people, like, a hundred and fifty years ago, two hundred years ago, they were saying that, like, planes will never exist?
[366:48.24]You'll never fly!
[366:49.86]Birds only do that!
[366:51.18]You're not a bird!
[366:53.52]Huh.
[366:54.16]Idiots, imbeciles!
[366:57.30]I'm probably gonna be one of those people that just says, I don't think, in 50, I don't even know if in like 30, 40 years, it might not be possible.
[367:03.19]I think we've plateaued electronically.
[367:05.55]Things will get faster, but until quantum computing deletes our universe, we'll see.
[367:16.92]It's gonna be wild.
[367:18.16]Guys, just watch.
[367:19.54]They're gonna turn on the quantum computer, and a little red line is gonna shoot out just instantly.
[367:24.46]They're gonna be like, oh, we programmed it to do, uh, Simon Says.
[367:28.29]Thing's gonna turn on, quantum computer's gonna point a fucking laser beam at the wall, and just... It's gonna be just deleting.
[367:36.91]And they're not gonna be, like, trying to turn the fucking thing off, and it won't turn off, and it's just delete, delete, delete, delete, delete.
[367:42.68]It's gonna go in a line and start deleting the earthquake.
[367:50.87]Just one line by line, just back and forth.
[368:02.01]They'll drop a nuclear bomb on this thing and it won't work.
[368:05.93]They'll just delete the nuke before it lands.
[368:08.42]It'll just point up like a sentry and just paint it over it like an eraser.
[368:21.37]So, I have no mouth and I must scream.
[368:24.03]They were on, I mean, come on!
[368:28.11]Every major scientist, every brilliant scientist, all, you know what they all say, the biggest threat to humanity?
[368:36.46]Is AI, is quantum computing, is this, that's the biggest threat.
[368:41.76]That's what they've said.
[368:48.28]I think I trust the greatest minds to ever live to give us an accurate representation of what we should potentially be afraid of.
[369:01.52]That's what Stephen Hawking said.
[369:04.90]You don't trust Stephen Hawking?
[369:23.08]He was right about black holes.
[369:24.76]Um... Yeah.
[369:28.06]He said aliens.
[369:29.98]He said aliens.
[369:31.00]But he said... Oh, did he... Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[369:44.42]It wasn't aliens.
[369:45.26]Ah, ah, ah.
[369:48.12]By 2014, Stephen Hawking...
[369:52.36]and business magnate Elon Musk had publicly voiced the opinion that superhuman artificial intelligence could provide incalculable benefits, but also can end the human race if deployed incautiously.
[370:10.94]There you go.
[370:12.20]It would end the human race.
[370:16.95]I remember he said that.
[370:18.55]He said that artificial intelligence is potentially one of the biggest threat... facing humanity.
[370:29.43]Anyways.
[370:31.76]Thanks for sticking around and see you guys tomorrow.
[370:41.56]Look up aliens.
[370:45.69]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[370:46.81]Take care.
[370:47.11]Have a good rest of your night.
[370:51.34]See you really soon for Salmon Max Episode 3, Part 2.
[370:56.29]Goodnight.
