[00:00.03]Test it.
[00:09.10]Okay.
[00:10.83]Hi, now you can hear everything.
[00:17.80]Don't break things.
[00:20.43]We have to do that at the exact same time.
[00:22.16]Ready?
[00:22.82]One, two.
[00:25.01]One, two, three.
[00:28.08]End.
[00:29.08]Done.
[00:32.44]Hurt myself.
[00:39.45]Oh shit, I gotta go.
[00:44.05]I think you're probably going over the speed limit.
[00:46.76]When you do that?
[00:47.32]Yeah, you probably are.
[00:47.97]It's probably like 30.
[00:48.98]No, it's definitely not 30 here.
[00:50.81]Dude, also, up here, check this out.
[00:52.29]There's this bus, and there's the other bus.
[00:54.06]No, no, keep walking down the road.
[00:55.63]There's that bus, and then there's another bus.
[00:57.78]How are either of these making that turn?
[01:02.23]Yeah, that's a very dangerous corner.
[01:05.55]That's an extremely dangerous corner.
[01:07.09]That's why they're parked here, because both of them realized they weren't going to be able to do this.
[01:13.20]Can we get a... Can we get...
[01:14.71]Excuse me.
[01:15.49]Sorry, they're behind us.
[01:16.65]Oh my god, that just scared the absolute shit out of me.
[01:20.04]That's... Dude, that guy just like screamed in my ear.
[01:22.51]I've never...
[01:23.19]Finally can hear these people, but we're not going to listen now.
[01:29.65]I want to step up the lore.
[01:31.06]Okay.
[01:31.50]Those two buses, where are they going?
[01:34.85]There's an answer.
[01:36.74]They're going to the airport.
[01:39.09]Okay.
[01:39.89]For what?
[01:40.19]You know how busy airports are?
[01:42.77]and that that tiny like yeah that turn and just even the where is the airport here
[01:50.73]It's the spawn room that's the terminal for the arrivals and departures.
[01:53.91]Is it really?
[01:54.51]Yeah, that's an airport.
[01:57.00]Or maybe that's a bus terminal.
[01:58.97]Maybe it's not an airport.
[01:59.77]Maybe I'm just making shit up.
[02:02.68]Have you ever seen an airplane in this game?
[02:04.51]No.
[02:05.61]I can't say I have.
[02:06.35]Not even with slipstreams?
[02:07.67]What the hell are you doing?
[02:19.08]Check this one out.
[02:24.51]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20!
[02:39.77]Where'd he go?
[02:41.02]Where'd he go?
[02:41.78]He wasn't on your screen and all of those hits hit him.
[02:44.25]Where'd he go?
[02:44.97]I don't even know where he went.
[02:45.96]Where did he go?
[02:48.78]Who cares?
[02:49.97]Holy shit, I really do.
[02:52.48]Where's my coffee?
[02:53.71]Get me my coffee!
[02:55.95]No, that's an empty one.
[02:56.84]Where's my actual one?
[02:57.97]I dunno.
[02:58.69]Did you spill it?
[02:59.68]I spilled it.
[03:01.89]Oh, it's back here.
[03:03.02]Yeah, grab it.
[03:04.98]Ooh, thank you.
[03:05.69]Okay.
[03:09.20]What?
[03:13.37]What were you going to say?
[03:14.88]Am I going to what?
[03:15.34]I was going to say, when are you going to feed me?
[03:18.37]I don't know.
[03:18.80]After we end the stream?
[03:20.57]Six or seven hours?
[03:23.85]but then you're just going to make me go back in the cell.
[03:25.39]It's funny because we actually only did this stream only to do that one joke in the very beginning.
[03:30.48]And half the people here didn't see it.
[03:32.01]And half the people here don't even know what we're talking about.
[03:40.05]What the fuck?
[03:41.73]How did you all split up that much?
[03:44.30]Get a shaver and shavester, ugly beard.
[03:48.07]Damn.
[03:49.28]Ugly beard.

[07:39.76]Dude, can you see these?

[08:08.63]Dumbasses.
[08:09.64]I'm just gonna play Roadhog.
[08:11.93]Apparently Roadhog plays well on this shit stain of a computer.
[08:16.61]Everything's wrong.
[08:20.84]Oh, hi!
[08:22.47]Oh, he doesn't have that bound.
[08:23.76]I tried to wave.
[08:25.15]He doesn't have the wave bound.
[08:27.65]Good Overwatch setup.
[08:30.40]Oh, what language is that?
[08:31.34]Why is it that language?
[08:33.43]That's stupid.
[08:34.70]It should be the language I chose.
[08:37.89]Delete system 32.
[08:38.94]That'd be pretty funny.
[08:45.18]I'm like nearly dead.
[08:50.89]I was going to say I'm going to follow my team.
[08:55.07]That's...
[08:57.38]This is going to be dreadful.
[09:12.69]Oh, I have to reload.
[09:14.49]Oh my, oh me.
[09:17.34]Dreadful.
[09:19.07]Oy, poppy.
[09:21.97]Wow, that Starhog looks really bad on a white background because Jerma doesn't have better twitch.tv or black twitch.tv or anything.
[09:28.81]Because, again, incompetent asshole.
[09:31.54]Change every setting.
[09:35.51]There should be a randomized keybinds.
[09:37.64]Like, if there's always a default keybind button that you can press, why isn't there a randomized...
[09:44.53]Sorry you couldn't eat a goopy.
[10:08.56]Your life must suck.
[10:11.31]What?
[10:13.48]Bloody poop all the time.
[10:23.04]I think you did.
[10:25.62]I think you had it in your hand when you left.
[10:34.36]Oh, I'm out of ammo.
[10:37.34]Don't.
[10:37.86]No, please.
[10:40.54]I used this.
[10:52.03]Even with Ster here, you can still hear Dermap.
[10:54.81]I can hear him.
[10:55.74]It's clear as day.
[10:59.44]Especially because I have ears and you guys just have electronic ears.
[11:09.72]I wish I could be a black woman.
[11:21.87]This is not going to end well for me.
[11:27.87]I did not even mean to throw that hook.
[11:30.11]I tried to crouch.
[11:32.96]But it was perfect.
[11:35.32]No, I heard you.
[11:43.09]Yeah.
[11:43.92]No, it hurt the drain pipe.
[11:45.97]No, it was definitely you peeing.
[11:48.58]No, you did not.
[11:49.92]There's no fucking way.
[11:51.43]Like, you can hear the splash in the water and then the drain pipe a second later.
[11:56.19]No, you can't.
[11:57.79]No, you can't.
[12:01.08]Can you?
[12:02.20]You can.
[12:11.93]You can hear my like faucet being turned on.
[12:16.46]Did you welcome these people to the fucking solar system?
[12:18.64]I did.
[12:18.99]I did.
[12:19.59]I did it very, very...
[12:21.41]I think I might have missed Jolteon QT.
[12:23.56]I might have.
[12:24.53]How did you miss him?
[12:26.14]I think it was at the exact same time.
[12:27.61]There's another one.
[12:29.72]Scream.
[12:30.50]Scream.
[12:30.90]Scream.
[12:31.26]That's not what I sound like.
[12:36.50]pretty much let's be real here
[12:43.32]Oh my god, that's... shocking.
[12:46.24]Secret senpai?
[12:48.18]Wow.
[12:49.21]What you want to go do right now secret senpai is go over to twitch.tv/Ster also subscribe there That's what you meant to do
[13:01.99]That's what you meant to do.
[13:06.56]Did you get G8, 28?
[13:09.65]Okay.
[13:09.93]And yeah, I think I missed Jolteon, for which I sincerely apologize on Jerma's behalf.
[13:14.19]What do you want for food when we get out of here?
[13:23.42]I feel like when we talk pizza, we're talking like,
[13:26.13]Chinese food, we talking Mexican.
[13:28.97]Something memorable.
[13:31.10]Oh yeah, I'm not on the point right now.
[13:33.68]Oh, that hook pulled me towards him as well.
[13:35.82]This game was made by fucking children.
[13:38.95]Literal children.
[13:40.40]That's not what I think.
[13:42.65]Oh, is this where we are in the world?
[13:44.36]Why is that not in English?
[13:46.23]I don't... Why is it that language?
[13:52.56]You're really digging yourself quite a few graves here.
[13:55.39]No, that's no.
[13:57.24]JolteonQT says he does not accept my apology.
[13:59.64]Well, Jolteon...
[14:00.44]You can go over to twitch.tv/dirt, subscribe there.
[14:03.94]That's what you meant to do.
[14:06.55]Don't worry, he's being paid to be here, guys.
[14:09.26]Yeah, this is a paid sponsorship.
[14:10.79]This is a paid sponsorship for Star to be on here.
[14:13.76]Yeah, I'm trying to promote his channel.
[14:15.21]Yeah, he's promoting the channel.
[14:16.57]It's about $6,200 of mine is being put into this.

[14:41.01]Make it JulesYoungQT2.
[14:41.90]No, I don't know that.
[14:42.98]And three and four and five and six and on the seventh one They're trying to say like we're losing
[14:55.22]What is someone trying to say?
[14:58.99]I can't play on this setup.
[15:00.68]I'm golden damage apparently.
[15:06.37]Can you get a play of the game here?
[15:08.60]No.
[15:08.88]I want to see it.
[15:09.57]Come on.
[15:09.93]Someone else already has it for sure.
[15:12.18]That's not the right attitude.
[15:21.64]No, you didn't see it.
[15:23.87]I thought there was a microphone on my way.
[15:26.08]Maybe it's the lights.
[15:29.44]Maybe you shouldn't be on beach.
[15:31.23]I'll change it to a Rectile Dysfunction.
[15:41.83]Change it to um...
[15:50.87]Why is your monitor tilted backwards?
[15:55.80]It's like, it's slightly angled back, like, leaned.
[16:00.54]I'll do it.
[16:00.90]I'll get it.
[16:01.36]I'll get it.
[16:02.01]You do it.
[16:02.53]I'm playing.
[16:05.30]Do it while I'm playing.
[16:06.66]I'm going to get a mixed angle shot.
[16:11.91]This is hurting.
[16:12.56]This is hurting.
[16:13.44]Ow!
[16:14.32]Ow!
[16:15.02]Ow!
[16:16.01]Ow!
[16:18.37]Ow!
[16:20.52]Ow!
[16:21.82]Ow!
[16:22.41]What are you doing?
[16:24.46]Stop!
[16:28.63]What's happening?
[16:30.04]Ah!
[16:30.20]Ah!
[16:32.26]Don't get us in a room together.
[16:40.19]When we get in a room together, we get real weird.
[16:47.64]What is this?
[16:49.36]Alan Wake?
[16:51.27]Am I hurting you with my flashlight?
[16:54.53]Fatal frame?
[16:56.11]But it was fine this whole time until then.
[16:58.12]Oh, come on.
[16:58.70]I didn't press the button to accentuate it into you.
[17:01.75]I was just kind of putting it on you.
[17:05.14]Look at all these, look at all these, like, face palms.
[17:10.78]Oh my god.
[17:11.38]Can we get some Kappas in the chat?
[17:15.77]they're already there get a room we're in one we're already in a room
[17:25.98]to get one.
[17:26.54]We're already here.
[17:32.00]Yeah, this is kind of, um...
[17:35.06]This is actually kind of a game that probably should have left a while ago.
[17:40.88]Can't figure it out.
[17:42.53]No, let's play, um... Let's play Alan Wake.
[17:45.56]No, we're not gonna play Alan Wake.
[17:48.65]We're gonna get food.
[17:50.78]Done.
[17:52.39]Hold on.
[17:53.03]Let me sit up.
[17:55.18]Let me try one.
[17:55.89]Let me give it a shot.
[17:59.09]Anything that requires a controller to play would be beneficial.
[18:05.31]Well, I don't know what else we have.
[18:07.90]You don't have any other games half of the games, but like what do you want to play on like a stream Super Mario?
[18:14.53]I cannot do that.
[18:15.37]That I cannot do.
[18:16.56]I can't accommodate that either.
[18:19.57]The new Star Fox.
[18:20.72]Can't accommodate that.
[18:22.08]Dark Souls 3.
[18:23.56]Can't accommodate you on that one.
[18:37.27]Waiting for something.
[18:39.51]Kid Icarus.
[18:41.03]I can't accommodate you on that.
[18:45.83]Chairman doesn't have the rights to Super Mario?
[18:47.86]Crazy Taxi.
[18:50.62]No, it has to be something I actually own.
[18:52.15]Time Crisis?
[18:53.59]I would play Time Crisis.
[18:55.50]Salt and Sanctuary could work, but the only problem with that is I'd have to use the Elgato HD Game Capture 60.
[19:01.42]Which is the worst product.
[19:02.57]It actually belongs in the trash.
[19:04.74]So, you know, whatever.
[19:10.10]I should've like brought you mine.
[19:12.09]No, when I, I'm going to eventually, when I have enough money in my bank account, I'm going to try to get a new computer and just get like an actual capture card.
[19:19.78]Like an espresso machine.
[19:23.38]I already have one of those.
[19:27.55]Good purchase, not related to gaming.
[19:29.42]What a waste of money.
[19:31.54]I'm a coffee guy.
[19:34.08]I'm a coffee guy.
[19:39.68]How hard do you think I could kick your computer and it not break?
[19:46.24]What's the threshold here for me?
[19:50.36]I would say if you were trying to... Like there's a bug on your leg, right?
[19:56.62]You see there's like a spider on your leg and you're like, get out of here, spider!
[20:00.35]I think that'd be okay.
[20:02.24]If you're yelling, get out of here, Spider.
[20:03.54]You don't have to kick your leg.
[20:05.51]You think it would just get up and leave?
[20:06.59]Yeah.
[20:07.15]I think it would hear you.
[20:08.36]Maybe.
[20:10.93]Anything more than that, you're talking about like soccer?
[20:13.54]You're talking about a full-on soccer kick?
[20:15.89]Then I think you'd be out of luck.
[20:23.45]soccer, but can I hear myself talking right now?
[20:30.17]Which one of these?
[20:30.77]Yeah, you have my stream on.
[20:31.78]I just heard me.
[20:33.19]I'd heard like...
[20:35.21]Why does it say you went offline?
[20:37.20]That's all my phone says.
[20:38.57]985 went offline.
[20:42.30]My whole phone.
[20:44.91]What do I want to do?
[20:48.99]Mustard Pharaoh?
[20:51.21]Mustard?
[20:51.89]That's barely mustard.
[20:54.60]Cramsicle?
[20:55.65]Cramsicle Farrah?
[20:57.53]Caramel.
[20:58.74]That's creamsicle, right?
[21:00.28]Caramel.
[21:01.41]Camel.
[21:02.65]I need to get to 55.
[21:03.54]I need to open my box on camera.
[21:06.01]We need to have, like, when I get the box in, it's like, what's going to happen?
[21:09.54]I see a request for handball.
[21:12.52]Oh, you mean the game that you don't even own?
[21:15.86]What?
[21:17.43]The game that you don't own anymore?
[21:19.72]Oh yeah, I refunded handball, didn't I?
[21:23.78]You refunded that game.
[21:25.67]I downloaded Handball.
[21:27.49]We played...
[21:28.78]And I refunded it, but I still made a video on it.
[21:31.71]I still have it.
[21:33.12]I didn't get rid of it.
[21:34.72]Holy shit, that's some Steam abuse.
[21:37.03]Yeah, what a piece of crap.
[21:46.12]That's really funny.
[21:48.57]I did not remember that.
[21:52.69]Scumbag.
[21:53.45]Watch this air shot.
[21:55.42]Almost got it.
[21:57.18]Damn it.
[21:59.59]That looked like it would hit.
[22:02.08]Not bad.
[22:03.64]That's how you practice.
[22:04.55]I've been working on it.
[22:05.59]Binding of Isaac?
[22:07.52]We play Binding of Isaac.
[22:08.28]That could work.
[22:09.95]You down for some Binding of Isaac?
[22:13.00]He's giving me the look.
[22:13.67]I don't know.
[22:16.97]He's giving me the look.
[22:18.60]I still have to finish making this video that was supposed to go up today.
[22:22.83]Yeah, it kind of was.
[22:35.03]move back so many people there let's just play Stardew Valley for like five hours
[22:45.19]No.
[22:46.17]I'm kind of done.
[22:48.69]We already had this conversation, didn't we?
[22:56.96]This guy has your idea.
[22:58.85]Just get started.
[22:59.86]Finish the video.
[23:01.44]Just get started.
[23:03.25]I'm already paying you $6,000 to be here.
[23:06.13]What's another like 200?
[23:07.36]What's another 300?
[23:09.35]I'll finish your video.
[23:12.07]For...
[23:14.14]What?
[23:14.56]For what?
[23:16.13]My frap?
[23:16.79]A McDonald's frap?
[23:18.28]Is that what I heard?
[23:20.31]Hold on, I'm gonna die because of being a moron.
[23:23.22]I don't know why you're so proud of that
[23:36.45]It's weird to think of it that way.
[23:37.86]You know what would be that bad is like subjecting myself to like a really shitty,
[23:46.24]Oh, they're in the same room.
[23:49.46]Alright, so you have...
[23:50.81]Okay, I'm gonna time you.
[23:52.11]So you have... 25 minutes to finish my video.
[23:55.63]That's not enough time.
[23:57.78]I'm gonna ult.
[24:02.18]What just happened?
[24:06.49]He killed everybody.
[24:07.58]I wanted some of that.
[24:09.49]What an ult, man.
[24:10.53]Holy shit.
[24:14.96]That was crazy.
[24:16.18]Well, that's probably play of the game.
[24:17.93]That's going to be funny watching me hit no one.
[24:20.60]I didn't get one hit marker at all.
[24:23.23]I'm excited to see that.
[24:34.52]being healed I think that's a sign I'm just gonna change into Torbjörn and then we're gonna play like
[24:42.69]Play hangout.
[24:44.37]I'm just gonna play hangout.
[24:45.63]I'm too distracted hang of what I'm go.
[24:47.84]I got oh Just did
[24:58.45]Don't worry.
[25:00.56]Here comes the hangout.
[25:03.43]The hangout is don't get capped in five seconds when they push next to you.
[25:06.94]There's some theories going around that Otto died.
[25:09.94]That's not true.
[25:11.57]He is perfectly fine.
[25:12.81]I told you he's on vacation at my mother's.
[25:15.00]They're calling it revacation as he died.
[25:17.24]This is like
[25:17.62]That's the joke that I said that that's what it sounded like, but it's not true.
[25:20.77]I need health.
[25:25.90]Where's the pack over here?
[25:29.06]Did they... Wasn't there a health pack that used to be over here?
[25:32.60]No.
[25:33.60]Never?
[25:34.08]Never.
[25:34.45]Are you sure?
[25:34.97]Yes.
[25:35.91]You're sure about that?
[25:36.78]Positive.
[25:38.66]I thought there was like a small one or something.
[25:50.61]aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[26:01.81]I'm not that invested in the game right now, I must say.
[26:04.44]I'm too busy looking at you.
[26:08.23]Alright, I'll pay attention now.
[26:27.02]Where did you go?
[26:27.89]Not you.
[26:30.40]Alright, I gotta put a turret up.
[26:36.76]Oh.
[26:38.33]Mute the volume if you're going to do that.
[26:39.43]The audio is playing, but it does say Jerma went offline.
[26:44.14]It's odd.
[26:45.34]Maybe because when I... You had it on when I turned it off and came back in like 30 seconds, right?
[26:51.14]Maybe it's just freaking out.
[26:57.30]Mining helmet says that you suck, you're a piece of shit.
[27:08.49]What?
[27:09.40]Really?
[27:14.59]200 videos you've uploaded.
[27:17.18]200?
[27:17.55]Again?
[27:17.87]It happened again?
[27:19.03]What?
[27:20.10]I altered and he killed three or four people with his ult.
[27:22.67]Again, this happened a second time.
[27:25.50]I ulted.
[27:26.14]I thought a push was coming in.
[27:27.17]They all died from the Junkrat.
[27:32.01]Who killed him?
[27:33.11]Who fucking killed this guy?
[27:34.36]It's Junkrat.
[27:36.49]Junkrat is just killing everybody I look at.
[27:38.82]It's fucking crazy too because I haven't seen a Junkrat.
[27:41.27]I know!
[27:41.96]Where is the Junkrat?
[27:48.21]I'm gonna stay over here.
[27:50.35]Hang out in the back.
[28:06.81]Don't do that on my stream.
[28:08.31]We don't make bird noises here.
[28:11.16]We make, like, parrot noises.
[28:15.31]Come get your armor!
[28:20.05]We dead?
[28:28.19]There he is.
[28:28.59]Yeah, can you go look at someone?
[28:30.71]Yeah, I'm going to go look at somebody.
[28:31.70]I'm going to be the marker for this Junkrat.
[28:36.07]He's on it.
[28:40.03]Oh, my turret!
[28:44.97]No bird noises allowed.
[28:52.76]Are you reloading your gun with egg yolk?
[29:02.65]That's pretty good.
[29:03.57]I like that one.
[29:05.90]Egg yolk.
[29:06.44]I like cracking an egg and dumping it in.
[29:08.69]That's a good one.
[29:09.27]I like that a lot.
[29:11.07]Who said that?
[29:12.12]They need credit.
[29:12.91]They need the proper credit.
[29:18.95]It was Ster.
[29:23.61]Yeah, research shows that it was actually a Ster the whole time.
[29:35.21]Sorry.
[29:37.85]I did some work.
[29:41.96]Star, watching your Medium XL videos for the second time.
[29:45.40]No, not the second time.
[29:46.18]He says on the second channel.
[29:47.24]Oh.
[29:48.02]Don't watch those.
[29:50.43]Why not?
[29:51.42]I don't know.
[29:53.30]I don't play D2 anymore.
[29:55.85]Those videos are like four years old.
[29:59.31]D2 got a patch, though.
[30:00.33]D2 just got a patch.
[30:01.90]If D2 ever gets full-on, hard-on support, so you don't have to scroll to select a skill.
[30:09.40]hard-on support
[30:19.73]That would be pretty awesome.
[30:21.22]I feel like it'd be difficult to get that game to HD.
[30:28.07]The HD ruins the spawns of enemies and everything.
[30:31.41]Does anybody kill this Lúcio?
[30:32.73]Am I gonna have to just go get this Lúcio?
[30:35.59]Apparently.
[30:38.59]I guess so.
[30:39.05]Got a minute left.
[30:39.92]Two minutes left.
[30:40.88]About a minute forty.
[30:41.63]Have you figured out what you wanted for food?
[30:42.83]Um, what is the most expensive place?
[30:47.12]I was going to suggest baby food.
[30:49.41]I go to the grocery store and I'll get you like four mashed up peas and carrots.
[30:52.97]Yeah, that's what I meant.
[30:53.75]What's the most expensive baby food?
[30:56.35]Hmm, Gerber Baby?
[30:57.48]I don't know.
[30:57.96]Is Gerber Baby expensive?
[30:59.15]I don't know.
[30:59.63]Probably not.
[31:00.05]They have a lot of commercials, so I'd imagine they're not.
[31:04.80]I don't know.
[31:06.15]I really don't know.
[31:09.85]Well, this is gonna be the push right here.
[31:21.05]Did it just come out
[31:40.70]Who's left?
[31:48.05]Who's on it?
[31:48.61]Reaper?
[31:49.85]Reaper?
[31:51.51]What, there's a reaper over here?
[31:56.34]I said we don't make bird noises.
[31:59.07]Those are baby noises.
[31:59.92]I want my Gerber baby now.
[32:03.87]That's my baby part.
[32:13.82]Too ready here.
[32:14.79]I have to clear this up because I get this question an outrageous amount.
[32:22.13]Yeah.
[32:23.04]Why does my shitty Minecraft series that no one should ever view, that's your favorite thing I've ever done.
[32:29.34]Okay.
[32:30.56]Why does that start at episode two?
[32:33.97]or episode three starts at episode three.
[32:35.90]I would lean in for this one so they can hear you.
[32:39.50]The first two episodes?
[32:43.10]were just a real Minecraft let's play.
[32:47.23]What do you mean?
[32:48.14]Like, they were normal.
[32:49.77]There was nothing.
[32:50.83]They didn't follow the story.
[32:52.46]Just out of nowhere.
[32:53.24]We didn't even watch that play of the game, by the way.
[32:54.77]The one that we wanted to watch.
[32:56.47]Yeah, we didn't.
[32:57.87]Hope it was good.
[32:58.66]That was way more important.
[33:00.16]So you made an episode that was a Minecraft Let's Play.
[33:03.64]I can't remember why I did it.
[33:05.45]And you deleted it because you didn't want people to know you did a Minecraft Let's Play?
[33:08.38]No, no, no, no.
[33:12.58]This is too complicated.
[33:15.15]I don't think it is.
[33:15.67]I think you're overcomplicating it.
[33:17.74]How does it work?
[33:18.49]Tell us.
[33:20.28]55.
[33:21.00]They didn't fit in with the story, so I removed them.
[33:24.78]The overarching story of I made a really shitty worst thing on YouTube series.
[33:29.41]They didn't fit.
[33:30.33]I want to do it.
[33:31.72]I want to do it.
[33:32.48]Wait, easy.
[33:32.75]No.
[33:32.87]No, it's my game.
[33:33.99]No.
[33:34.50]It's my...
[33:35.52]Mom!
[33:38.16]That's basically mine now.
[33:39.69]You got three.
[33:41.17]Three.
[33:41.51]You got three.
[33:42.11]You got a purple.
[33:43.16]You got a purple gold.
[33:43.92]You got gold and you got a may.
[33:46.89]That's me.
[33:53.20]Yeah, good.
[33:54.65]It opened up my box.
[33:58.35]What the fuck are you doing?
[34:07.37]Thanks for opening up my box.
[34:09.10]Sorry, I don't even care.
[34:12.10]You didn't even have that?
[34:12.94]Look at him holding the bird in his hand.
[34:15.05]I don't even care, dude.
[34:16.20]Look at Bastion holding the bird.
[34:19.55]He's holding the bird.
[34:22.46]Like the dead bird.
[34:27.20]You okay?
[34:28.05]Yeah, I'm fine.
[34:30.03]Hey, you want Chinese food?
[34:38.91]Funny guy.
[34:39.64]Hey, funny guy over here.
[34:41.74]Hey, Secret Senpai, just subscribed.
[34:43.41]Oh, that was like 40 minutes ago.
[34:45.36]It was 22.
[34:46.30]See, don't you like to see how long it... Like, that's helpful.
[34:51.44]Better than your shitty... Look, I'm like just a head floating around.
[34:53.83]Isn't that cool?
[34:54.66]Watch this guys.
[34:58.89]Watch this one.
[35:04.36]No, no, no, no.
[35:05.37]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[35:07.34]I'm scared.
[35:08.37]I messed it up.
[35:09.45]Help!
[35:11.50]I screwed it up.
[35:12.82]I don't like that.
[35:13.38]I don't like how I look with that one.
[35:14.97]Yeah.
[35:15.55]They can see me.
[35:16.37]They can like see my face with this one.
[35:20.34]They see the real me.
[35:22.57]My shitty beard.
[35:23.49]Shave it.
[35:24.04]Shave it.
[35:24.60]Shave it.
[35:26.43]I look like a dickhead in that light.
[35:28.74]This one's fine.
[35:29.52]You do often.
[35:33.27]People were requesting a rave party.
[35:35.96]I can't do that on this.
[35:37.61]I don't think it allows it.
[35:39.38]No, that one sucks.
[35:40.06]I don't like that either.
[35:40.70]Don't like it.
[35:41.10]Don't like it.
[35:41.50]Dislike.
[35:41.81]Dislike.
[35:42.05]Don't like it.
[35:42.39]Dislike it.
[35:43.59]That's better.
[35:44.56]No.
[35:45.08]That's like... No, I don't know.
[35:47.02]No.
[35:47.31]That's a little... No.
[35:51.22]Don't like it.
[35:53.85]Actually, no, I do like it.
[35:58.51]Okay.
[35:59.86]Are we still playing Overwatch?
[36:01.81]Let's look at what I have.
[36:04.47]For...
[36:06.38]But we could play Hearthstone.
[36:07.62]You want to play Hearthstone and win games?
[36:11.45]How are we going to do that?
[36:12.62]It's going to be fun.
[36:13.77]Someone said my hair looks flat.
[36:15.19]You want to see how easy it is?
[36:17.12]You're going to get your bugs.
[36:18.13]Don't get your bugs all over me.
[36:20.43]That didn't help at all.
[36:21.36]Actually, no.
[36:21.76]Now I have like a clockwork poof.
[36:23.97]He's just got bugs all over.
[36:25.32]They're like, I can see them.
[36:27.29]It didn't work.
[36:30.51]So much saturation.
[36:32.23]It was a little too much.
[36:34.72]I will play one more game on Overwatch.
[36:38.96]And then we might leave to get food.
[36:43.94]Because how long have we been streaming for?
[36:46.00]Can I get an uptime, please?
[36:48.51]I'll do it.
[36:52.31]You want to know the easiest way to do this?
[36:54.53]It took me months.
[36:56.42]You just look at OBS?
[36:58.05]Yeah.
[36:58.13]I didn't know that you're having a hard time.
[37:00.60]You're having the hardest time doing this.
[37:02.85]Oh, 37 minutes.
[37:03.66]It's been like two hours.
[37:06.17]Like an hour and a half or so.
[37:08.24]Yeah, we're gonna go hang out, guys.
[37:10.57]We're gonna go get food and, you know, all that great stuff.
[37:13.93]food and, you know, like, there's like boogers in my nose and I'm so embarrassed I'm trying to make it, like, unobvious that I'm trying to wipe them.
[37:21.68]Disgusting.
[37:22.94]Yeah.
[37:23.54]You can turn the camera off if you want.
[37:25.10]You can just pick it real quick.
[37:26.37]Oh, ew.
[37:30.25]I'm gonna play Hanzo.
[37:30.95]I'm gonna play my mustard, Dijon mustard Hanzo.
[37:38.58]I feel like you're like here, so I'm like I'm like always like kind of like yeah like
[37:44.03]I don't know.
[37:44.49]What the fuck was that?
[37:45.02]It was like we're in a club and you're unsure of why you're there.
[37:47.95]Yeah, I was.
[37:50.03]For a second, I was.
[37:50.92]That was weird.
[37:51.44]That was odd.
[37:53.77]Turn the camera off.
[37:55.84]No, but then you won't, I can't prove that we're in the same room.
[37:58.81]Yeah, this is a special occasion.
[38:00.64]This is a special occasion.
[38:01.68]How many viewers we got, like 30?
[38:03.37]Like 1600?
[38:04.22]1700?
[38:04.42]60 here?
[38:05.73]Something like that, I don't know.
[38:08.50]That's an all-time high.
[38:11.72]Hangout we're gonna go get food.
[38:14.94]Hey when the streams over can you raid my stream?
[38:17.21]Your stream that's offline.
[38:19.64]Yeah, and I'll stream like tomorrow
[38:21.55]Like, just stay there until tomorrow.
[38:24.41]You're going to stay here?
[38:25.28]You're going to stream from here?
[38:26.42]No, no, no.
[38:27.04]Tell them to go to my stream and stay in there until tomorrow.
[38:30.17]Yeah, then they'll do that.
[38:31.52]What did Boo say?
[38:35.10]I missed it.
[38:36.22]Boo said something.
[38:38.67]Did he or is somebody just saying that they love Boo?
[38:41.21]Because everybody does.
[38:42.39]Come on.
[38:43.48]We have to share Boo because everyone loves him too much.
[39:00.98]He got me.
[39:04.67]He got me with a jab.
[39:05.11]The Trash Man is great.
[39:07.50]Oh, Low Seat Man.
[39:10.45]Lucky man.
[39:11.40]Losey man.
[39:11.84]Thanks for stopping by.
[39:12.93]That's a reference.
[39:14.00]What is it?
[39:15.91]To what?
[39:19.33]I thought you had to elaborate and tell me what the reference was.
[39:22.54]I don't know.
[39:23.36]I imagine it's a reference to something in his life or something he's familiar with.
[39:28.29]Probably.
[39:29.34]What is any screen name or handle?
[39:32.52]Oh, Boo said he demanded Bastion.
[39:34.15]You demand we play Bastion?
[39:36.08]Well, we'll see how Hanzo goes for the next, like, quarter of a second.
[39:40.14]Yo, Hanzo's a good character.
[39:42.51]Yes, he is.
[39:43.06]See?
[39:45.25]Yep.
[39:45.68]That's good.
[39:47.62]Hey, what's up, man?
[39:48.37]How you doing?
[39:50.58]I wish you were, like, there.
[39:51.96]You know what I mean?
[39:52.41]I wish you were, like, over there so I could just be like, hey!
[39:55.32]But then I wouldn't be over here.
[39:57.23]Yeah, but then, like, you could be, like, there.
[39:59.98]Boo says... Boo says...
[40:04.06]I will.
[40:08.02]You already said, you just told me that.
[40:11.69]I'm having too many laughs.
[40:13.76]I can't even play.
[40:18.93]This is the guy that killed me?
[40:21.22]How?
[40:23.80]He did one bullet hit you.
[40:26.78]So he killed me.
[40:28.85]I just want to do the shoot the dragon.
[40:31.89]and then I'll play magic dragon maybe do that a little bit
[40:41.37]Really?
[40:46.30]Really?
[40:50.84]Give me the dragon.
[40:55.19]If this dragon gets more than one kill.
[40:58.73]Wow.
[40:59.45]We had the same idea.
[41:00.19]Look, I'm going to delay it a little bit.
[41:08.88]off.
[41:17.91]I dispersed him a little bit.
[41:21.03]Do you ever play connect the dots?
[41:22.68]Sometimes.
[41:29.20]Whoa, I love connect the dots.
[41:31.85]Are you serious?
[41:32.92]How come they don't have connect the dots anymore?
[41:34.39]AlosuMan says you're his favorite.
[41:37.05]Really?
[41:37.53]You're the first person he's ever subscribed to.
[41:40.89]Really?
[41:42.32]Well, that is an honor.
[41:43.68]Thank you, my friend.
[41:44.63]It was you.
[41:51.67]Can you stop looking this way?
[41:52.94]Can you look directly into the lens for the rest of, like, for a full life?
[41:57.65]Fuck.
[41:58.98]Okay.
[42:00.40]I'll give it a try.
[42:03.08]Look directly into people's souls.
[42:04.97]Me too.
[42:06.03]I'm going to try to play with my peripheral.
[42:11.17]I see what you're doing.
[42:12.20]Yep.
[42:13.53]You can watch the stream.
[42:15.36]Make sure you know that I'm not fucking this up.
[42:17.74]I'm...
[42:22.71]I see you just sitting there eating.
[42:24.55]I got him.
[42:29.68]Okay, I'm done.
[42:32.02]I can't do it anymore.
[42:34.33]I mean, I'm further away.
[42:35.24]Wait, what?
[42:36.20]What were you doing?
[42:37.56]Where did I end up?
[42:43.62]I'm behind them?
[42:45.80]When did that happen?
[42:50.33]Oh, man.
[42:51.58]Oh, man.
[42:52.10]Not again.
[42:52.66]Oh, no.
[42:56.46]Worked out.
[43:00.20]Jerma doesn't look like he has eyes.
[43:02.23]Yeah, it doesn't.
[43:03.45]You can't even really tell that either of us were looking at it.
[43:05.54]Really?
[43:06.40]Yeah.
[43:06.52]Oh, but that was so cool.
[43:07.54]Because it's the Batman lighting.
[43:11.25]I like these lights.
[43:14.53]I'm a fan of these lights.
[43:15.51]Shit, this is sniper.
[43:24.28]I'm doing pretty good.
[43:24.97]A couple requests to insult you.
[43:26.83]For what?
[43:28.38]To insult you.
[43:29.14]Insult me.
[43:29.60]Alright, go.
[43:29.99]Give me your worst.
[43:31.75]But don't do too bad.
[43:33.73]Oh nice arms, you steal those from a baby?
[43:42.83]Could've gone harder than that.
[43:44.72]I'm just trying to find the starting place.
[43:51.86]Come on, really?
[43:53.48]Bullshit.
[43:54.39]You got a couple of golds going.
[43:56.42]I do have a couple of golds going.
[43:57.36]This is some intense game plan.
[44:00.07]Jerma's good at blocking bullets with his head Jerma is a sausage
[44:10.62]I've been called worse.
[44:15.10]One time somebody called me a...
[44:18.94]Hold on a second.
[44:20.92]Yeah, there's a couple of reds.
[44:22.50]There's a couple of reds moving in.
[44:25.61]Oh, you see.
[44:26.41]Oh, you up, you up, you up.
[44:27.82]You up, you up, you up.
[44:31.51]I would've just scatter-arrowed, man.
[44:39.86]Hey, whatever.
[44:48.61]Anything else?
[44:49.69]Any more brain busters?
[44:51.44]Someone accusing you of living outside of Boston.
[44:56.84]What an offense.
[44:57.72]What a federal offense that is.
[44:59.21]Okay.
[45:06.16]Jerma turned into a train.
[45:07.87]You actually did.
[45:08.47]That noise was very train-like.
[45:12.59]You want to do one more to redeem the rest of the gun?
[45:16.50]I can't play on that and have fun.
[45:18.53]Alright, ladies and germs.
[45:20.38]See what I did there?
[45:20.96]Got you.
[45:21.85]Uh, we're gonna get food.
[45:23.86]And then, um...
[45:26.22]I don't know if we're gonna hang out.
[45:28.65]Don't do that.
[45:30.56]That's not a good thing to be doing.
[45:32.19]Especially when your arm is down and your waist is below the camera.
[45:36.48]Okay, we're gonna have to go ahead and do this for just a second here before he gets me in a lot of trouble.
[45:46.30]Alright, bye guys.
[45:47.17]Thanks for all the people that, uh, all the new subs, all the old subs, all the viewers.
[45:51.38]We love you so much.
[45:53.27]Right?
[45:56.48]What the fuck, dude?
[45:57.51]Don't do it.
[45:58.10]No!
