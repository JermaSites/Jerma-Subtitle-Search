[00:03.11]No, I completely feel you.
[00:08.17]And I haven't done the tutorial.
[00:11.21]And I'm on the tree.
[00:12.59]He's going to.
[00:14.04]Well, the tutorial is... I mean, there is no tutorial.
[00:18.11]It's just click on ball in the right spot.
[00:20.39]No, in Ember.
[00:21.53]Oh, you didn't do the tutorial in the other game.
[00:23.71]No, I got it.
[00:26.49]Wait, you've just been addicted to the pitching game for the last 30 minutes?
[00:30.58]I time zoned wrong and I started my stream an hour early.
[00:34.04]I got to do something.
[00:34.98]I might as well be a super psycho.
[00:37.94]It's literally five minutes.
[00:39.41]It takes less than 10 minutes.
[00:41.30]Have you started your stream?
[00:42.28]Are you, like, ready?
[00:42.98]Are you waiting?
[00:43.54]I just turned it on.
[00:45.79]Oh, God.
[00:46.59]I was under the... I didn't... Look, 2023, Ster, I'm trying to be more on time.
[00:51.55]I appreciate that, but I didn't expect that.
[00:53.69]I was waiting for you to be angry at me that I wasn't quite immediately ready at 1 p.m.
[01:00.49]Because, like, I'm, you know, I'm here, but I'm not quite ready.
[01:06.94]And I was like, I thought I was going to get the squirrel spiel with, oh, I'm like, oh, here he is, late, late guy.
[01:13.23]2023, I'm trying to be less on time.
[01:14.73]Because I keep showing up on time and no one's there and I feel like an idiot.
[01:20.63]Like I went out to go like meet up at a restaurant with someone and showed up like exact, I'm so good at getting an Uber and getting there at the exact moment.
[01:28.45]Like, hey, like let's do 6 p.m.
[01:30.05]I'm there 6 p.m.
[01:31.47]And me and Ashley walked around for 30 minutes to wait for them.
[01:35.49]I'm done.
[01:40.29]Well, anyway, this is going to be fun.
[01:42.95]I just turned on my stream.
[01:43.89]Let me say hello.
[01:45.49]Hello, everybody.
[01:47.33]Welcome to another stream.
[01:49.45]Today, we have a special guest.
[01:54.18]No, never mind.
[01:56.02]What?
[01:56.20]What was that?
[02:00.38]I mean, isn't that implied?
[02:01.42]That's implying that like, oh, it's like Bob Hope is here.
[02:04.96]You know what I mean?
[02:07.32]That's why I'm not a special guest.
[02:08.74]I mean, you're... Yeah, I mean, you are, but you're always a special guest.
[02:12.38]Right?
[02:12.60]Like, you... But I'm not a body of hope.
[02:17.48]Uh, Ster is here.
[02:18.78]We're gonna play Ember the Firefighter game in about 15 minutes, because he's not ready.
[02:26.58]So we're just gonna hang out.
[02:27.46]We'll just chill.
[02:29.53]I heard from a little bird that you were interested in playing some like PS1 games.
[02:36.39]I am, yeah.
[02:39.55]Driver 1 is the first one.
[02:41.55]I have got a hard hitting recommendation.
[02:44.96]Do you?
[02:45.34]Have I played it?
[02:46.74]I don't know.
[02:47.12]Not a lot of people have played it.
[02:48.64]You know, I'm into like the hipster games that no one enjoys and no one likes, but I think you might like this.
[02:52.89]Okay.
[02:53.97]Shout out to Jade Cocoon.
[02:56.43]Any Jade Cocooners?
[02:58.21]I actually, I think I own that.
[03:00.89]I just never played it.
[03:02.70]It's the Dark Souls of Pokémon is what they would be saying in the modern era.
[03:07.44]Oh, no, no, it's not that.
[03:08.52]I have something else.
[03:10.92]You need to get in on some Jade Cocoon.
[03:13.30]Is it for PS1?
[03:15.17]I believe so okay it's actually an amazing game and it's like you like breed your Pokémon and like based on what two types you choose they like gain traits of each other and they like visually look that way also everyone in the world dies oh well so it's Dark Souls of Pokémon don't spoil it we haven't even played it well I'm just I like I don't want to see you cry on stream
[03:39.79]It's a real tearjerker.
[03:40.93]Yeah.
[03:42.27]But every time we've ever seen a movie together, it doesn't matter what it is.
[03:44.81]I cry at like every other scene.
[03:47.77]Star, say it's like Monster Rancher with better combat.
[03:50.59]Is that a selling point?
[03:51.99]Have you played Monster Rancher?
[03:54.17]I used to play a ton of it.
[03:55.53]Okay.
[03:56.39]I was going to reverse recommend you Monster Rancher if you never played it.
[04:00.59]No, when I was a wee lad, when like Monster Rancher 2 was new, I remember going around the house and like finding all the AOL discs to try and get a good monster.
[04:08.69]A good mon.
[04:10.42]But it's always the wolf.
[04:12.39]Yeah, that first scene and up, I have to take a day off before I come back to the movie.
[04:16.81]I cry for about six hours.
[04:18.15]And then the next day I can watch the rest of the movie.
[04:20.69]And I make sure that I don't watch that part.
[04:22.89]I watch it from that part forward.
[04:25.05]Okay, so like close your eyes for like some parts of Jade Cocoon.
[04:28.03]Okay.
[04:29.47]And like don't listen to the soundtrack because it's like good and you'll like cry.
[04:37.52]Okay, so you've done the tutorial.
[04:39.32]Yeah, it seems like it's pretty easy to get in the game.
[04:41.52]You just do like a join code and a password with a private match.
[04:47.82]And I did kind of speed run the tutorial, but it did take me about five minutes and some change.
[04:54.04]It's very quick.
[04:57.23]I'm gonna zoom.
[04:57.85]Yeah, if I did it in five minutes, you could probably do it in three.
[05:06.38]Grimro, why do you sound like you're acting?
[05:09.06]What?
[05:09.96]Isn't he always?
[05:10.52]Dude, why do you sound like you're acting again?
[05:15.39]What do you mean?
[05:16.57]Why do you have to say again?
[05:21.55]No, it's the intro.
[05:23.09]Ster, do you still do the intro voice kind of, even though it's been like more than a decade?
[05:27.52]The intro?
[05:28.34]What is going on, guys?
[05:29.54]Hey, guys, Grimro here with another farming strategy episode.
[05:34.46]no no like yo guys what is up dude how do you start your stream like when you turn your stream on are you like hey what's up what's up how have you done um I don't know I don't start my stream very often it's a hard question to answer yeah but then you like kind of get over it after like five minutes it's like okay this stream just turned on alright are you nervous are you nervous right now I mean I didn't I mean this legendary star is they call with me I mean come on
[06:05.57]I didn't pay attention to the... Hold on.
[06:08.71]Okay, no, I'm good.
[06:09.84]I'm doing the tutorial.
[06:11.20]You know, they're like throwing puzzles at me.
[06:13.18]It's so easy.
[06:14.04]He's acting like he's not acting.
[06:29.40]Time zones are wild.
[06:30.84]Hey, Sturge, do you know that there is a spot on Earth where it is over the course of three days?
[06:38.68]There's a time zone where it could be January 5th, 6th, and 7th because of how the time zone works.
[06:48.33]That's kind of messed up.
[06:49.55]Yeah.
[06:49.85]Did you know that?
[06:51.55]I mean, I didn't know.
[06:52.98]I did.
[06:53.38]That's something that you know that I did not know.
[06:57.22]There's some knowledge to drop on you.
[07:03.99]Everyone's yelling at me now.
[07:12.09]Stop, you're not smart.
[07:16.48]I never said I was smart, I just said I was dropping knowledge.
[07:22.40]What?
[07:27.51]Doesn't smart imply that I kind of came up with that concept?
[07:31.61]I watched somebody talk about it and then I forwarded the email to Ster.
[07:42.89]Is knowledge smartness?
[07:44.03]I mean, I guess it is, yeah.
[07:45.79]Being able to deduce things.
[07:51.63]I think I have a general feeling that I'm going to be very bad at this game.
[07:57.65]Why?
[07:59.23]Because I'm in the tutorial and I'm like really confused.
[08:05.95]Wait, how?
[08:07.21]The confusion per minute is too high for a tutorial.
[08:10.37]How?
[08:11.47]Wait, you can... No, you're not confused by this.
[08:13.83]You just have to like break windows and put out the fires and run through the... and turn off the electrical outlets.
[08:19.89]I've never been in a fire before.
[08:23.17]When he said, is knowledge smartness, Omega Lull.
[08:33.83]Can you please be quiet?
[08:34.67]I'm watching Ster right now.
[08:42.91]I think I did it.
[08:44.25]You don't got us both up in a fucking two monitor scenario.
[08:50.08]I believe I'm ready.
[08:50.76]Alright, so I can tweet.
[08:51.72]No, I'm not ready.
[08:52.28]I got to do the shop.
[08:53.16]I got to get my tools and upgrades.
[08:55.06]I got to buy my ladders.
[08:56.54]It takes two seconds.
[08:58.02]You'd be ready in a minute.
[09:00.26]Okay, now I'm ready.
[09:03.06]are you making the game um I I could if you want me to I think it's just yeah yeah you host I need a let's see so yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so let me see okay I need a decent password let's see do I even need that
[09:38.66]Okay.
[09:39.06]Does that work?
[09:42.84]Can you join me?
[09:44.48]I definitely don't want to show this on stream.
[09:48.05]Is this like a join code that's just pasted at the top of the screen?
[09:54.57]I don't know.
[09:55.13]Okay, I can type it to you.
[09:57.57]Hold on.
[09:58.59]There's a join code and a password.
[10:00.09]Did you set a password?
[10:01.73]That's the password.
[10:03.75]And the join code is this.
[10:10.00]That is the join code.
[10:11.28]Hopefully when you do this, it doesn't stay on the screen.
[10:15.02]What's the Nintendo buddy code?
[10:18.44]I think you may... Did you just join?
[10:20.48]Yeah.
[10:21.17]Okay.
[10:23.77]How do I get the join code off the screen?
[10:27.09]Alright.
[10:30.09]What job do you want to do?
[10:30.87]I imagine we're just going to do this first one.
[10:34.55]I don't know where you are.
[10:35.80]I don't know what you're looking at.
[10:37.88]Do you want to do easy or hard?
[10:39.63]Get as many clients out of the building as possible.
[10:41.73]It's just like a house.
[10:45.51]Stop spraying me.
[10:46.55]I can't show the screen, guys.
[10:47.99]You guys are going to get into the game.
[10:50.90]Cover it with your arm.
[10:57.64]Can I do it in the settings?
[11:03.05]He doesn't want to play with us.
[11:05.59]Okay, I'm using this loadout.
[11:06.77]There has to be... Wait, I can hide this.
[11:11.05]Settings.
[11:14.10]View Bob.
[11:14.82]Particle range, profanity filter.
[11:18.25]I can't take that.
[11:19.55]I have to actually cover the top right of my screen.
[11:21.83]I'm going to put my facecam up there.
[11:26.33]Shit, this is bad.
[11:27.75]Hold on.
[11:27.99]Uh-oh, this is bad.
[11:30.61]Well, it's just I have to find, I have to cover this right now.
[11:33.10]Is it showing yours?
[11:34.84]No.
[11:35.26]So the top right of your screen, there's nothing there.
[11:36.88]Okay, hold on.
[11:37.26]There's nothing there.
[11:40.38]People are going to see this, so I have to do this first.
[11:42.76]So I have to leave.
[11:43.40]I'm going to re-invite you.
[11:50.22]Why is the room code just sitting at the top of the screen?
[11:54.76]For, like, people that, like, enjoy others' company.
[12:00.48]Hold on.
[12:02.54]You have an insect mind.
[12:05.72]What?
[12:05.88]That's what somebody just said.
[12:07.05]Somebody said I have an insect mind.
[12:08.85]No, bro, I don't want to show the room code, and I can't turn it off, so I have to cover it with my fucking hand.
[12:24.16]Okay, hold on.
[12:25.18]Can you see it?
[12:25.84]I don't want you to be able to see it.
[12:27.94]Maybe the facecam could cover it.
[12:30.79]Let's see.
[12:34.09]Oh, dude!
[12:34.89]My password!
[12:38.47]I don't think it's going to be big enough.
[12:40.73]Yeah, if this doesn't work out, I've been telling my chat we were going to play League of Legends until we both hit Challenger.
[12:46.20]So we could just do that instead.
[12:48.18]I would rather...
[12:54.48]I don't know.
[12:54.76]I was going to... Never mind.
[12:57.08]Okay, how do I just make like a solid bar?
[13:01.94]Okay, there we go.
[13:02.58]So if I do this, and I just make it just like a black bar.
[13:05.78]I just don't want people to see this.
[13:06.94]Otherwise, the whole playthrough is fucked up.
[13:10.22]We're in the intro.
[13:14.96]You don't have those like...
[13:16.58]where you can take a screenshot of your screen program.
[13:19.42]I'm so slow.
[13:20.86]I'm just like, oh, what do I do about that?
[13:23.74]Take a screenshot of your facecam and then stretch it out to be like long to cover the whole thing and then you're good.
[13:29.96]I got it under control.
[13:32.00]Okay.
[13:34.02]Hold on.
[13:35.36]I'm waiting.
[13:37.48]God damn it.
[13:40.64]Why is this locked?
[13:41.61]Who locked it?
[13:45.32]Why can't I pick it up?
[13:46.70]Stop!
[13:48.62]Why can't I pick up the text thing?
[13:50.42]I just need to make sure it's covered first.
[13:57.20]Alright, you ready?
[13:58.56]Yeah.
[13:58.80]Is this your first time streaming?
[14:00.73]No, it's my first time needing to leak lobby codes permanently.
[14:05.04]Alright, I'm creating a game.
[14:07.82]Here we go.
[14:09.30]Here it is.
[14:09.88]I'm going to use that same password.
[14:11.96]What are you laughing at?
[14:12.90]Stop laughing.
[14:14.54]I don't wheeze laugh.
[14:15.52]I just looked at your stream to see how you covered it.
[14:18.31]That is gigantic.
[14:19.49]I know, but I need to make sure.
[14:21.17]I don't remember where it is, so I need to make sure it's covered, and I'll fix it when it's there.
[14:26.59]Okay, same password.
[14:28.04]Okay, creating.
[14:31.31]Okay.
[14:32.13]There's the code.
[14:34.30]Writing code to you right now.
[14:40.76]There's that.
[14:41.58]Okay.
[14:42.74]You should not be able to see this.
[14:44.90]Same password?
[14:46.22]Same password.
[14:47.86]I gotta make sure I don't fucking leak this.
[14:49.98]But I need to make sure.
[14:51.00]Will my facecam cover this?
[14:59.74]Don't leak it.
[15:00.54]It's close.
[15:05.90]Don't do it.
[15:08.53]Oh my God.
[15:09.29]I think I leaked it.
[15:12.87]No, I didn't.
[15:18.37]I typed it in your chat.
[15:20.72]Oh!
[15:22.18]No, I think I just leaked a letter.
[15:23.50]No, I didn't.
[15:23.92]I'm fine.
[15:25.50]They're going to guess it from one letter.
[15:27.22]They've got the code breakers open.
[15:31.32]Okay.
[15:31.74]Alright.
[15:32.10]I think I'm good.
[15:33.62]We're good.
[15:34.32]I'll just keep that there.
[15:35.18]Alright.
[15:35.86]Alright.
[15:36.10]You ready?
[15:39.06]Yeah.
[15:39.52]Yeah.
[15:39.96]Yeah.
[15:40.34]Let me hide it.
[15:41.26]Alright.
[15:41.64]Let's go.
[15:42.32]I swear to God, if this pops up, if this moves to the other side of the screen, I'm going to be fucking furious.
[15:47.06]Alright.
[15:49.00]You ready?
[15:49.98]Yeah.
[15:50.78]Get your load out.
[15:52.40]Yeah, I did.
[15:53.56]We only have like one load out, I think.
[15:58.38]Alright.
[16:00.20]Got your pizza?
[16:05.13]Are you an old lady?
[16:06.83]Are you an old lady?
[16:10.13]Yeah.
[16:11.17]Alright, so where's this fire?
[16:17.68]I think you have to pick a mission.
[16:18.80]I think it did not.
[16:22.22]Change job.
[16:23.48]This one here.
[16:24.56]Yeah, we're on it.
[16:25.42]Accept job.
[16:26.78]I think we have to drive the car.
[16:31.27]Gather your team.
[16:32.22]That's us right here.
[16:34.08]Oh, okay.
[16:34.52]Here we go.
[16:35.72]Come into the zone.
[16:38.60]Don't forget the grapple hook.
[16:39.68]I don't think I have that.
[16:41.40]We're new.
[16:41.96]We're new.
[16:43.84]Alright.
[16:45.58]Get as many clients out of the building as possible.
[16:47.27]Welcome to your first house fire, Responder.
[16:49.97]Make sure to save at least... Alright.
[16:51.27]It's burning now.
[16:53.07]Yeah, we got to go.
[16:53.99]Going front door.
[16:55.85]Remember to be careful.
[16:57.09]If you die on your first job...
[17:03.03]Do something!
[17:03.57]I'm watching you!
[17:05.39]You know how every job has this... That actually hurt me.
[17:08.81]That took health off me.
[17:15.54]What?
[17:15.78]What's going on?
[17:16.32]Why is this stupid computer up?
[17:22.64]Limit testing.
[17:23.30]Limit testing.
[17:24.68]We just have to see how it works.
[17:27.96]You're almost dead, by the way.
[17:29.70]Yeah, I'm aware.
[17:31.70]Hey, dude, stick your tongue on that.
[17:35.82]On what?
[17:36.56]The electrical thing.
[17:43.08]Alright, we got to go.
[17:44.57]Yeah, we got client vision on three.
[17:47.29]Okay, where are they?
[17:49.45]They're dying.
[17:51.03]They're dying.
[17:53.49]There actually is a timer at the top.
[17:55.05]It's being very generous, though.
[18:01.66]How many people are here?
[18:02.69]Oh, yep, I see.
[18:05.55]Is this like a... What's that really boring game you play with the power washing?
[18:11.55]Why can't I... This is... What?
[18:15.11]Oh, that's a great game.
[18:15.85]Alright, I have somebody.
[18:18.96]Can you not do that?
[18:20.66]I'm putting the... Can I not put the fire out?
[18:23.24]I'm walking with some guy.
[18:27.10]Oh, find bonus cash?
[18:28.44]We got bonus cash down here.
[18:30.26]I didn't hurt them.
[18:30.76]I don't think so.
[18:33.78]There's two people.
[18:34.44]I got one.
[18:41.09]I got one guy.
[18:46.37]Taking him out the back door.
[18:50.04]You can also rescue people's valuables.
[18:51.68]Oh, wait.
[18:52.14]We can rescue other stuff, too.
[18:53.86]Yeah.
[18:55.12]There's bonus cash.
[18:57.40]I'm checking the boxes.
[18:58.66]What about the bed?
[18:59.08]Can we take the bed?
[19:00.30]Oh, this thing's worth 16 bucks.
[19:04.26]I'm robbing him.
[19:05.73]I got a hundred bucks.
[19:06.77]I found his stash.
[19:07.83]His drug money.
[19:10.47]Oh, that counts.
[19:10.99]Okay.
[19:11.67]Alright.
[19:15.19]We're stealing.
[19:15.69]No, we're not stealing.
[19:17.75]They owe us.
[19:20.19]Did you get... Where did you put the person that you rescued?
[19:24.05]There's a back door place to put them.
[19:27.73]Oh, we're good.
[19:28.23]Okay.
[19:28.39]So now we have a little bit of time.
[19:34.94]Yeah, I guess we're done.
[19:35.56]Is there anything else upstairs that's valuable?
[19:39.74]I haven't been upstairs.
[19:42.96]I'll be breaking this.
[19:44.96]Where you at?
[19:45.38]Let's get the fridge.
[19:48.56]I can't pick the fridge up.
[19:57.94]Where are you?
[20:00.14]Come get some plates.
[20:03.16]I'm up in the kitchen.
[20:05.06]Let's get some... Wait, make a hole somewhere, right?
[20:11.66]A hole?
[20:12.12]Because we can probably throw this stuff out a window.
[20:15.04]Yeah, okay, right here.
[20:15.74]So get stuff over here, and then we'll throw it out the window this way.
[20:22.02]So find everything valuable and throw it out the window.
[20:25.67]Are the random things actually worth money?
[20:27.63]Yeah, $14.99.
[20:28.30]Yeah, like vases, jewelry.
[20:31.88]I found like an actual stack of money.
[20:33.94]I thought that was the only thing.
[20:41.61]I've got Hamtaro.
[20:42.81]It's too heavy.
[20:47.45]Holy, you throw far.
[20:50.88]You throw a bit too far.
[20:51.66]Here, come outside.
[20:52.06]Come outside. Come outside. Come outside.
[20:55.31]Follow me, follow me.
[20:56.57]Yeah sit on that chair.
[20:57.85]Here check this out.
[21:01.81]So we got another one back here.
[21:02.81]Oh there is another one. Okay.
[21:04.81]Easy access, like just grab all their shit.
[21:07.81]Snatch and grab.
[21:09.81]They have like a dish.
[21:16.81]We have to take things individually?
[21:20.68]This is $2.
[21:21.78]Why would we save a bottle of oil?
[21:27.80]That cardboard box.
[21:28.82]Make sure you save it.
[21:29.58]That's why I love that one.
[21:31.10]Well, inside that box is the family tree.
[21:39.74]People are screaming at us.
[21:41.22]They're saying, dude, fight the fire.
[21:43.74]No.
[21:44.43]This whole room is collapsing, actually.
[21:46.43]What?
[21:50.44]Was it a washing machine?
[21:51.32]Can we both pick it up?
[21:54.14]I can't get it.
[21:55.16]Maybe you need like equipment to pick up heavy stuff or something.
[22:01.04]Oh, these explosive barrels are worth 30 bucks.
[22:06.22]I don't think we should have done that.
[22:09.40]Why did it blow up?
[22:11.30]What'd you do?
[22:11.70]I don't think we rescued two people.
[22:13.96]I think we rescued one.
[22:21.77]What is this?
[22:22.31]Oh, alright.
[22:24.17]We should probably end it.
[22:24.96]Can we just end it?
[22:25.98]Yeah, let's go.
[22:30.58]I like the mix of... Oh, is this not where we go?
[22:32.54]No, no, no.

[29:16.05]This thing is so... I need a bigger ladder.
[29:19.51]What does this do?
[29:22.66]Remember, you can use your axe on dressers and doors and stuff.
[29:26.50]This guy was in the closet.
[29:31.52]I don't know if that's who you were looking for.

[29:57.50]If we don't save him, we can't extort him for cash.
[30:01.79]Top floor.
[30:14.70]I don't think there's anybody.
[30:16.06]Oh, there is somebody here.
[30:18.57]See what I mean?
[30:19.09]Where are they?
[30:21.85]Look, they're like inside of the sink.

[30:36.74]Why do you have this?
[30:37.60]This is a danger house.

[30:43.11]Why does somebody own that?
[30:44.11]Get him out of here.
[30:47.17]Oh, shit.

[30:56.54]Any valuables?
[31:00.54]I got a decent amount.
[31:02.85]I think we're ready to go.
[31:05.07]All clients find bonus cash.
[31:06.79]Yeah, we're good.
[31:07.99]Yeah, we're... Yeah.
[31:10.29]Get in the escape zone.
[31:12.15]That was masterfully done.
[31:15.91]Five star.
[31:18.29]Customer comments.
[31:19.13]You got us all.
[31:19.99]Alright.
[31:21.91]379.
[31:23.03]That's good.
[31:24.91]Is putting items in the car different than putting it in the rescue zone, I guess?
[31:31.42]Because one of them, it says salvage.
[31:35.98]Car equals you keep it.
[31:38.62]Why would we want to keep it?
[31:40.32]Because I'm here for me.
[31:43.14]I didn't do 20 years in fireman school to show up to a burning house and not rob them.
[31:48.54]Alright, we got this one.
[31:50.86]Oscar Heights.
[31:52.54]This is complete demolition missions in under three minutes.
[31:57.77]Or let's see.
[31:59.51]Let's just rescue.
[32:00.13]Should I do it on hard?
[32:02.64]You want to try a hard one?
[32:04.34]Yeah, sure.
[32:04.90]I have one question for all the smart people.
[32:07.40]I put the new item in loadout slot 5, but there was no loadout slot 5.
[32:12.25]And pressing 5 did not equip it.
[32:16.61]You know what I mean?
[32:17.97]I don't know.
[32:18.47]I don't know.
[32:19.03]Stop asking me questions.
[32:24.26]Here you go.
[32:25.56]It's a skill issue.
[32:27.28]Press use.
[32:28.26]That is the load I'm using.
[32:31.06]So these are the first three missions.
[32:32.04]We'll see what opens up.
[32:37.65]Okay.
[32:38.09]Apparently you have to press that.
[32:39.75]There are six.
[32:40.43]I'm going up top.
[32:43.15]Okay.
[32:43.71]Bottom floor.
[32:44.93]Spread and conquer.
[32:45.47]Divide and conquer.
[32:47.29]I'm going all the way up.
[32:50.93]This is a huge factory, dude.
[32:55.65]We need to get, like, individual scores so I can, like, make it in the pro circuit.
[33:03.01]Got someone.
[33:04.63]They went all the way up.
[33:06.52]Where's the escape zone?
[33:09.42]I'm marking it.
[33:11.30]Ah, you almost bounced him.
[33:12.34]I put the bouncer.
[33:13.92]I got him.
[33:14.34]I got him.
[33:16.30]Another person right here.
[33:24.79]Ay!
[33:25.27]What the hell is this shit?
[33:31.32]This TV's worth 30 cent.
[33:32.38]Alright.
[33:33.04]I'm gonna throw a bunch of shit down to you and put it into the... Where's the thing?
[33:39.21]I don't know.
[33:39.73]I'm in the house.
[33:46.11]Absolutely nailed it.
[33:47.35]I'm taking this pizza.
[33:49.11]This computer's worth 50 bucks.
[33:52.32]Uh, find our car.
[33:52.98]We're taking that.
[33:54.50]That's a Mac.
[34:02.49]I'm hitting this guy with the bounce.
[34:03.83]Get in there.
[34:05.17]Come on.
[34:05.47]100 bucks.
[34:07.27]Yes.
[34:12.53]What?
[34:18.20]Pin.
[34:20.42]Box.
[34:22.64]Chair.
[34:22.88]I'm angry.
[34:25.67]Don't turn the light on.
[34:26.89]I'm in here.
[34:31.00]What about this side?
[34:31.64]Uh-oh.
[34:37.74]I think the time goes by much, much faster on hard.
[34:40.20]That's what makes it hard, right?
[34:43.96]Yeah, probably bigger buildings and...
[34:53.46]Uh, we got all con- there's two more people.
[34:56.28]Or one more, I think one of them is you.
[34:58.24]Uh, can you throw that person I just threw down here?
[35:01.49]Yeah.
[35:02.29]He's trying to go back in the house.
[35:03.45]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[35:04.67]Put them back down.
[35:09.37]Let's make a good path.
[35:11.27]Make a path.
[35:13.15]You have to go to the bathroom that bad?
[35:15.05]He's on fire!
[35:19.12]At this point, just piss outside.
[35:20.00]I gotta get him out.
[35:23.26]Why are they going back to the bathroom?
[35:25.14]You know, that's how Sims are.
[35:34.17]Going back up to the bathroom.
[35:35.81]Alright, who else is around?
[35:38.95]Whoa, what?
[35:40.19]Somebody below.
[35:44.49]Somebody below.
[35:44.95]That's me.
[35:45.37]I'm the one below.
[35:45.95]It's someone on the roof.
[35:47.51]Third floor.
[35:48.67]Like top left of the building.
[35:51.18]Oh, no, no, no.
[35:52.12]I am right next to them.
[35:52.78]Hold on.
[35:55.40]Ah, what?
[35:56.34]You alright?
[35:59.84]I hit a door and it turned red.
[36:01.82]For future reference, that's bad.
[36:03.56]The door blew up.
[36:04.98]I can't get into the building.
[36:06.90]I can't get in here.
[36:08.12]Here we go.
[36:08.38]Okay.
[36:15.21]Wait.
[36:15.43]No, they're over here.
[36:18.77]Yeah, see, that's...
[36:20.91]Look at all these clothes.
[36:28.24]Did you get any... Take that... Didn't see the money behind you?
[36:31.80]I didn't.
[36:33.24]You are a... You are... I'm putting that in the car.
[36:38.98]Where's our car?
[36:41.32]What do you mean I didn't see it?
[36:46.52]I'm the one that called it out.
[36:50.17]Blind streamer.
[36:55.89]I got their TV.
[36:56.53]Alright, let's go.
[37:03.63]Alright, I get it.
[37:04.29]This game is fun.
[37:06.41]Yeah, I dig it.
[37:10.53]Oh, we didn't get somebody.
[37:11.95]Shame we killed Bob.
[37:15.71]He probably walked back in to go piss.
[37:18.82]Is that really our fault?
[37:21.79]This is a chat comment.
[37:24.57]This is what they all, they're all going to spam this.
[37:26.45]400 bucks, 500 bucks.
[37:32.81]Alright, this is where it gets, I think, a little real because this one's a little harder.
[37:40.04]It's a big hotel construction site.
[37:43.34]And it's, it's, it's like a medium rare.
[37:51.80]This is a medium-rare mission.
[37:55.21]I think we need to... This mission, we need to spend some time making some money.
[37:58.65]Okay.
[37:59.63]There's like grappling hooks and stuff and... Let's go for it.
[38:09.56]Conj... What?
[38:14.37]-2 bad you couldn't get us all.
[38:16.57]I know you're doing you're just you're fucking up the whole stocks.
[38:20.51]And that's funny.
[38:21.25]But like that's that's negatively impacting my stream.
[38:24.47]There there is a deployable toilet which will make the people who have to pee go to that toilet.
[38:30.58]You could put it outside and they'll come to the toilet.
[38:35.71]Uh, we cannot use la- ...but it seems you've fallen right into our little trap here.
[38:39.57]See, you Ember firefighters might have 85% of the North American market, but you best not forget about your Canadian competition at Hoser.
[38:47.85]And, as you can see- I'm gonna throw this fucking box at him.
[38:50.36]...this construction site.
[38:51.48]Okay?
[38:53.68]What do we do?
[38:54.12]Okay?
[38:56.12]Uh... Oh, make a trail from the electricity to us?
[39:01.80]I- I think we- we move-
[39:05.43]Get that away from me!
[39:07.39]I just hit the skybox.
[39:08.87]Why?
[39:10.77]HP hop.
[39:13.25]It does, like, no damage.
[39:15.66]One day, I will probably, like, harder difficulty, and then... Okay.
[39:17.88]Ow.
[39:29.48]You might ask us, Bowser, why are you doing this?
[39:32.66]Well, we're here to directly economically compete with Ember.
[39:36.43]Using socialism.
[39:39.41]Ow.
[39:41.59]Who built this?
[39:46.45]Alright, there's a bunch of flour and bricks and electricity.
[39:49.63]I feel like this is like puzzle time.
[39:53.72]So you're going to have to help with this because I have no idea what the hell I'm doing here.
[39:57.20]I don't know what I'm doing.
[40:01.75]Oh, you can mark.
[40:02.91]We have to open this.
[40:14.27]Alright, we need to connect wires.
[40:15.97]Like that.
[40:18.87]You did the tutorial, right?
[40:20.55]Yeah, and then this connects to here.
[40:27.13]What are you doing over there?
[40:28.68]Oh, I was trying to blow down this wall.
[40:30.10]Look like you could destroy it.
[40:31.54]I got it.
[40:40.73]You've made it to the elevator.
[40:42.29]Sorry to tell you, we cut the electrical lines.
[40:45.19]Good luck getting back up and running again.
[40:47.25]Oh, Jermador!
[40:48.07]I don't know where we're going.
[41:06.26]We have to turn this on with the electricity.
[41:07.68]Is there an outlet over there?
[41:18.37]I'm looking.
[41:19.27]I'm looking, honey.
[41:22.04]Yeah, there is.
[41:22.42]I'm connecting them.
[41:24.84]Wait, I can't.
[41:25.48]I think I got to put objects.
[41:35.54]Hurry up.
[41:37.12]It's a whole thing, dude.
[41:44.06]Finally.
[41:44.44]Could we even find any bonus?
[41:45.69]We didn't even find any bonus cash.
[41:47.89]They're trying to kill us.
[41:48.79]So we have this competition now.
[41:54.39]Okay, 200 bucks.
[41:54.99]I got 1,000.
[42:11.24]OK, this one's apparently pretty hard.
[42:15.00]But let me look.
[42:15.90]We got money now, right?
[42:18.20]Yeah.
[42:21.72]Ooh, fire extinguisher.
[42:24.70]Ice accelerator.
[42:25.56]I'm buying this.
[42:34.31]I don't really care about this iPad.
[42:35.75]I mean, I guess you can see how it's important.
[42:41.94]The extinguisher?
[42:42.92]Oh yeah.
[42:46.55]You ready to do this next one?
[42:48.17]I am so ready to pop in and pop out.
[42:53.43]My guy.
[43:01.55]This one apparently is pretty difficult.
[43:03.69]It's halfway up on the thing.
[43:08.06]Five extinguisher reactions.
[43:15.71]Alright, I got my new thing.
[43:16.92]Get as many clients.
[43:17.54]You see this thing I got?
[43:18.18]Alright, I'll go upstairs.
[43:24.02]You go downstairs?
[43:25.80]Wait, you went downstairs.
[43:26.78]What are you talking about?
[43:28.88]Just, never mind.
[43:29.60]Let's go.
[43:39.45]There's one.
[43:40.41]There's seven people here.
[43:45.12]What's the point of having that many people?
[43:48.70]Ow.
[43:49.16]Ow.
[43:49.80]Ow.
[43:49.88]I don't know.
[43:50.38]This is like a 7,000, 8,000 square foot house.
[43:53.36]What happened?
[44:01.42]Why did we just both die in here?
[44:04.00]You died?
[44:04.48]Yeah.
[44:05.16]What happened?
[44:08.32]Can you help me?
[44:09.66]I'm coming.
[44:11.21]This person won't help me.
[44:12.33]I'm lying down.
[44:13.17]Did I just kill them?
[44:18.81]you died too I was slightly near the like stove fire I guess you sprayed water on a grease fire you got us killed man how would I I'm supposed to differentiate and other people it's a it's a cartoon game where you spray a bunch of oh you you should have known it was a grease fire what I how am I supposed what we just lost money didn't we replay
[44:46.77]Back to the academy.
[44:47.73]Alright, same deal.
[44:48.65]You go up, I'll go down.
[44:50.47]I think maybe this time I should go down.
[44:52.19]Now let's both go down.
[44:53.15]Considering you murdered everyone.
[44:57.43]I'll take care of the grease fire.
[44:58.41]Just get me in there.
[45:03.04]I'm a different class than you, so I can't do that part.
[45:08.60]See, there you go.
[45:09.12]You bought the thing for that.
[45:11.28]You take him out.
[45:16.52]yeah I do um I have the extinguisher um the shovel and the landmine so I have a different loadout that's my class okay oh I have um as an axe okay and a trampoline that doesn't bounce
[45:45.54]What other games do we have on co-op Sunday?
[45:51.06]Is that an announcement that you're not having fun?
[45:58.14]Because when I asked you to play this game and you were immediately like, okay, what other games?
[46:03.87]Before we had even played one round of this, he was like, oh, maybe some other games we can play on the same day.
[46:12.43]No, I'm just saying.
[46:14.63]Do you have anything else in mind?
[46:17.15]I linked you Played Up, which seemed like a funner version of whatever the normal cookie game is.
[46:26.28]No, I just lost the computer.
[46:28.06]We need to sell that.
[46:28.98]Oh, I'm going to turn this off.
[46:42.98]He hates it.
[46:43.64]I mean, this really seemed like a game you would like.
[46:45.74]No, I don't.
[46:46.52]This is fun.
[46:47.18]I'm having a good time.
[46:48.86]I'm just saying.
[46:49.58]So why do you want to play a different game?
[46:53.84]I'm just making the argument that, you know, you and I don't get together that often, right?
[46:59.53]Like, sometimes we do, and there's, like, other... So we got to speedrun games?
[47:02.29]There's, like, other things we could be doing.
[47:04.31]No, I'm... So, like, how quickly do you think we can get to Challenger and League?
[47:10.31]Ster... I would rather...
[47:13.08]I would rather be naked on camera than play League of Legends with you for an hour.
[47:19.50]You think it would take us an hour?
[47:20.52]Oh, you caught me so bad, too.
[47:28.50]Like, you fucker.
[47:29.62]Like, you just... I just feel so personally attacked.
[47:34.16]Dude, the whole... Like, our timer's almost up.
[47:37.17]Dude, there's three people up here.
[47:39.29]I killed one.
[47:40.01]What?
[47:41.52]There's a skeleton near the mattress I missed.
[47:45.16]What do you mean there's a skeleton?
[47:46.54]Why can't I climb?
[47:47.00]There's an actual skeleton.
[47:57.07]This is not a skeleton.
[47:57.95]Oh, this person's dead.
[47:59.53]No, down by the rescue zone.
[48:00.95]Like, this place is almost down.
[48:03.19]This roof sucks.
[48:07.04]Where do I even go?
[48:07.90]Put that person into the pen.
[48:11.16]Into the pen?
[48:13.40]I am saving people left and right, man.
[48:15.04]Get him into the pen.
[48:16.58]I'm trying.
[48:27.31]You killed... You... What?
[48:28.77]Why did he turn into a skeleton?
[48:32.45]I watched you fall in the, like, x-ray thing.
[48:36.25]Just a dead body and then your fucking body landing next to them.
[48:40.25]I'm in trouble too.
[48:42.93]I'm hurt too.
[48:43.87]I'm getting out.
[48:45.97]We only have five out of seven.
[48:52.56]This is an absolute failure.
[48:54.82]Yeah, so what other games do we have?
[48:59.86]Hey, dude.
[49:02.78]Look up over this balcony up here.
[49:03.96]You can put the ladder up here.
[49:06.46]I don't have a ladder.
[49:07.72]I fell.
[49:08.10]I sprained my ankle.
[49:09.30]Wicked bad.
[49:10.14]I can't get up.
[49:10.94]I got 20 seconds, dude.
[49:12.39]Get up here.
[49:12.89]Pick me up and throw me over.
[49:14.01]Where is the exit?
[49:16.95]I don't know.
[49:18.31]It's the blue thing.
[49:22.03]My ladder is all the way on the roof.
[49:23.57]No, I'm not playing.
[49:24.31]Everyone's saying League of Legends.
[49:25.73]Honestly, I would rather eat a ghost pepper than play League of Legends right now.
[49:31.50]Alright, let's try this one more time.
[49:33.84]We can do it.
[49:35.26]We can do this.
[49:36.12]We actually made $225.
[49:41.04]I messed up the trampoline.
[49:43.50]It flipped over when I threw it down to the bottom.
[49:47.40]You guys should just react to Family Guy clips.
[49:51.17]That sounds pretty good.
[49:55.77]Do not start saying that.
[49:58.55]okay let's go let's go let's go I got this person here you gotta you gotta get the guy next to the fire the grease fire lucky there's a Family Guy how are we already almost at a time this place isn't like really like this is like a real fire we did like joke fires before
[50:29.83]Okay, go to seven.
[50:30.71]Alright, let's keep going.
[50:34.29]Where's my ladder?
[50:34.85]Almost all of them are on that right side in that building.
[50:44.52]We're not on bad time here.
[50:46.61]We're doing fine.
[50:48.71]We also do need to like... I believe you can...
[50:52.36]You know, put out the fire and the timer won't go down as fast.
[50:55.34]We've kind of just been letting everything burn.
[50:59.16]Oh shit, that is what's going on, OK?
[51:15.82]Like the support beams of the house start falling down, right?
[51:21.10]Here, you handle... I'm... You want me just to be on fire duty?
[51:24.91]I'm gonna try and get to the roof and get those people.
[51:37.97]What happened?
[51:39.75]Uh... I don't know.
[51:51.82]come on no that's gonna kill them you throw someone off the roof yeah the trampoline down here dude come on where did he go he fell I think there's still a lot though
[52:25.16]There's one more guy.
[52:25.70]I got a murder.
[52:26.50]Alright, then we have to find how to get out of here.
[52:34.05]It's on the street.
[52:40.57]You got him?
[52:40.91]Yep.
[52:41.49]Okay.
[52:44.45]Where is it?
[52:47.13]Front of the house in the street.
[52:50.09]We got to leave like right now.
[52:54.65]I'm hitting these boxes.
[52:55.75]Why are you doing that?
[52:56.59]We have to leave right now.
[52:58.14]We have to leave right now.
[52:59.16]Because sometimes there's money in them.
[53:01.78]We have to leave right now.
[53:03.60]I'm taking this chair.
[53:11.54]Oh, they're going to lower our rating.
[53:14.93]Why do you have evil Spider-Man here today?
[53:21.83]Cool.
[53:22.07]500 bucks?
[53:26.69]I feel like a house like that, we do not have the proper equipment.
[53:34.06]We are understaffed.
[53:36.72]Underfunded.
[53:38.18]We got another one.
[53:38.66]You want to do more?
[53:39.20]How you doing?
[53:43.10]Are you not having any fun?
[53:44.38]Do you want to?
[53:45.20]No, I swear to God, I'm having fun.
[53:48.65]I'm enjoying this game.
[53:51.74]I just don't want it to be like a Wildermyth situation where you message me afterwards and you're like, this is the worst experience I've ever had.
[53:58.36]Do not recommend a game to me ever again.
[54:00.34]That didn't happen.
[54:03.38]You want a demolition?
[54:07.65]Burn the house down and clear out all the barrels.
[54:11.03]Sure.
[54:11.77]I bought a breach charge.
[54:12.77]Hold up.
[54:18.83]I'll put words in my mouth that I didn't say.
[54:22.64]Alright, I'm ready.
[54:29.55]I think we just have to.
[54:34.33]Stand in the thing.
[54:36.59]These are Incredibles cars.
[54:41.57]What's that mean?
[54:43.65]We could try Dota.
[54:44.41]Alright, burn the house down.
[54:57.65]There's a bunch of propane tanks here.
[55:04.23]There's a grease fire already.
[55:05.85]I'm just going to throw some shit in it.
[55:08.60]Oh, it's a toxic sludge.
[55:10.38]Here, hold on.
[55:10.92]I got this.
[55:17.98]Apparently I don't got this.
[55:36.43]Did you not shoot it?
[55:37.75]I got it.
[55:40.15]Go grab the propane tanks outside.
[55:41.43]There's like three.
[55:57.34]Fire's not spreading.
[56:06.09]I think there's like a torch or something out there.
[56:08.09]So it was like a fire thing.
[56:13.47]Well, if you were seeing all these things, what are you doing?
[56:17.01]What?
[56:17.35]I'm just I'm spreading the fire.
[56:20.32]Are you putting it out?
[56:22.30]What?
[56:33.48]How does this work?
[56:42.18]What does this thing do?
[56:47.83]Maybe we have to like smash something.
[57:01.14]How many things did you throw in here?
[57:02.26]Because the fire is like a tiny little thing in the corner.
[57:06.36]I threw like two or three propanes in there.
[57:08.48]There's also a roof.
[57:09.32]I'm on the roof right now.
[57:10.28]Oh, you're on the roof, yeah.
[57:14.20]I'll come up there in a sec.
[57:15.88]I'm throwing a propane in here.
[57:30.65]I'm not happy with the trampoline state in this world.
[57:34.24]Where are you?
[57:34.62]Are you upstairs?
[57:36.86]Yeah.
[57:37.46]Yeah.
[57:54.28]Like, why are you not having fun?
[57:56.11]I am.
[57:57.17]I'm blowing stuff up.
[57:59.45]Okay.
[58:01.77]I was just muted talking to chat for a second.
[58:02.97]I had a couple subs came in tonight.
[58:07.25]What are you telling them that you're not telling me?
[58:12.54]No, I'm just... They were giving suggestions for games, and I'm just like, I don't want to... I was essentially reprimanding them.
[58:29.46]Where are you?
[58:29.90]I'm on the roof.
[58:45.73]Apparently there's one more.
[58:47.07]Okay, we got all the toxic barrels.
[58:48.41]We got to burn the building.
[58:53.35]We almost got this.
[58:54.75]Almost.
[59:06.56]What?
[59:06.94]Alright, we did it.
[59:21.75]Yeah, we did it.
[59:22.05]Oh, we did it.
[59:22.37]Nice.
[59:23.80]Got it.
[59:29.91]That was interesting.
[59:31.63]It's like a reverse.
[59:37.60]Yeah, it's like a reverse.
[59:38.80]We only have one second to do that.
[59:43.94]Close.
[59:52.84]Yeah, I was putting out every single thing you were doing, by the way.
[59:58.26]I was fighting so hard to fix everything that you were doing.
[60:04.78]You're being me.
[60:07.90]Cut it out.
[60:08.46]We flipped.
[60:09.80]I think we flipped here.
[60:11.79]I picked a game that normally you would play, and you're being me.
[60:15.83]Alright, let's actually do this one.
[60:20.37]This one seems pretty hard.
[60:21.99]This is like a barrel factory.
[60:23.73]Let's do it.
[60:25.86]I promise I'm having a good time.
[60:27.66]I'm just messing around.
[60:33.72]You played the Uno reverse card.
[60:39.32]I'm on edge, dude.
[60:42.26]I'm on edge.
[60:48.02]Oh, it's an escape mission.
[60:49.55]I don't like these.
[60:51.25]Oh, hello again.
[60:52.59]We got your personal information off the Ember database.
[60:55.29]It was pretty easy to hack into.
[60:57.21]You've been making quite the kerfuffle for us up at Moser headquarters.
[61:01.03]We had our government buy out this oil barrel factory.
[61:04.09]When we get you out of our kooks, we're going to use this place to store 100% Canadian... Do you remember those classic videos?
[61:11.70]No, the Ster is bad.
[61:13.60]You're bad!
[61:19.23]Alright, how do we actually get out of here?
[61:21.25]Wait, what are we doing?
[61:25.12]We have to just get out.
[61:26.50]Careful.
[61:26.70]What?
[61:26.80]Dude, I still think that would be so fun and funny to do.
[61:29.12]To do the Stirrin' Jerma video remastered series.
[61:48.05]It would.
[61:48.49]We just, we pick a video and we just try to redo the whole video, but like without watching it.
[61:54.85]And then one of us makes the video and we premiere and we watch it on screen.
[61:59.57]And like, how close did we come to the original?
[62:06.04]What was the name of that game that we were going to do?
[62:07.68]I think it was Damnation.
[62:10.39]Yeah, I don't know.
[62:11.91]That game probably isn't even the servers.
[62:13.61]Probably.
[62:13.99]I don't know if you can play that anymore.
[62:15.23]Well, why not?
[62:15.71]It's been a long time.
[62:16.32]I think we got to get these gases sucked up into the fans.
[62:19.30]Okay.
[62:19.48]It looks like we got to turn.
[62:37.49]I just walked in.
[62:38.65]You just walked through it?
[62:39.45]Yeah.
[62:39.61]Okay.
[62:40.05]Whoa, I just smushed.
[62:40.59]Hey, dude.
[62:40.81]Don't press that button, though.
[62:41.85]I'm, like, investigating.
[62:42.56]It won't connect.
[62:43.34]The thing needed to be there.
[62:44.86]Oh.
[63:09.86]You goofed up your own goof, and you're still going to commit to the goof.
[63:18.63]You actually vanished.
[63:21.01]I am gone, yeah.
[63:22.15]You got turned into pace.
[63:23.33]Okay, cool.
[63:24.61]Now Star gets to be the one who does the whole game.
[63:36.38]That's cool.
[63:39.62]If you just want to like sit back and... Why can't I spectate you?
[63:52.61]Dude, just say you don't want to play.
[63:58.33]That's not what's happening.
[64:06.48]We can all read the situation, man.
[64:09.52]I don't know what I'm doing.
[64:10.48]I am a puzzle brainlet.
[64:12.38]Stop gaslighting him.
[64:22.83]Play something else.
[64:28.57]I... I don't know what I'm doing.
[64:31.42]I gotta open... Dude, maybe I can suck it up through the air vent.
[64:39.80]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[64:42.40]I got it.
[64:42.78]I got it.
[64:45.56]We did flip.
[64:47.58]We flipped.
[64:48.50]We absolutely flipped personalities today.
[64:50.26]Did you just hear what you just did?
[64:56.45]I'm like, I'm throwing barrels at you.
[64:58.79]I'm like putting objects in front of you.
[65:00.53]I'm like fucking with you when you're playing.
[65:02.53]And you're the noise guy today.
[65:04.29]You're fucking serious.
[65:11.78]That's interesting.
[65:13.86]Why did we flip?
[65:16.34]We just needed a change.
[65:18.08]You'll never get past our shipping pallets.
[65:20.07]They're going way too fast to just jump across.
[65:23.07]By the way, these will be shipped right out to our leak proof... What is on your screen right now?
[65:28.47]I'm in the first area where we spawned just looking at stuff.
[65:35.41]You guys did a soul swap.
[65:38.31]I think I'm at the exit, but you're dead?
[65:40.21]We did a freaky Friday.
[65:45.55]I think I'm at the exit, but it won't let me leave because you're dead.
[65:49.09]I'm not sure.
[65:53.57]You probably have to come and get me.
[65:55.53]Where are you?
[65:57.49]The spawn of the level.
[66:06.48]Man, it is a chore playing games with Ster.
[66:13.29]See, now you get it after all these years.
[66:15.63]Now you understand.
[66:17.55]When I asked you, you could have just said no.
[66:21.43]How are you gaining health?
[66:31.55]I don't know.
[66:36.48]Okay, come with me fast.
[66:38.10]We have a minute.
[66:39.56]We're not doing this again.
[66:40.78]Come, follow me.
[66:52.13]You can do that jump, right?
[66:52.91]Where the fuck did you go?
[66:54.43]Wait a minute, I'm supposed to be star.
[66:56.09]I'm supposed to be star today.
[66:56.87]You can do that jump, right?
[66:58.07]I'm supposed to be star today.
[66:59.33]I'm star today.
[67:01.01]One minute, dude.
[67:01.77]I swear.
[67:05.27]Jerma, look.
[67:05.85]Look at me.
[67:06.53]Look at me.
[67:10.84]Bro, you can't do it now either.
[67:20.64]Okay.
[67:21.02]Go, go, go.
[67:31.81]Okay, wow, thank you.
[67:32.91]That's like $100 for the carry service.
[67:43.17]This one is very hard, by the way.
[67:45.97]Okay.
[67:47.41]I mean, I feel like we have to do the very hard one.
[67:50.82]Sure.
[67:52.82]Anything you request, my master.
[67:55.46]This one's called Empire Towers.
[67:58.40]Yes, dear, I'll put on the dog ears.
[68:13.78]Are you doing hide and seek?
[68:15.74]Do I have a hat?
[68:18.52]No.
[68:19.10]What do you mean no?
[68:20.32]There's no hat.
[68:21.84]What?
[68:25.35]I don't have a hat on?
[68:26.11]No.
[68:29.45]How about now?
[68:30.71]Pretty cool, alright.
[68:38.90]No, it's not.
[68:39.96]There's no hat.
[68:41.86]You go into your loadout and equip it in the loadout?
[68:44.64]I did.
[68:51.68]Oh, there it is.
[68:52.52]There it is.
[68:53.32]Did you get into Jerma's secret stash and eat all the edibles?
[68:56.12]Alright.
[68:58.70]This is just a huge couple of towers.
[69:00.51]I'm going to go on the one on the right.
[69:02.59]Uh, this is the only one.
[69:04.73]Oh, I thought we had two.
[69:05.51]Okay.
[69:05.85]I think the other one is an environmental, uh, choice.
[69:08.42]Alright.
[69:09.50]Ready?
[69:12.66]We have to, I don't know what to do.
[69:15.80]I think that's fine.
[69:18.16]Cause you haven't played a level.
[69:20.42]Is it?
[69:20.68]Well, yes I have.
[69:22.72]Check the tapes.
[69:27.03]I can't get in this way.
[69:45.30]I got one.
[69:48.86]The tapes say he hasn't played a level.
[69:54.85]Told you.
[69:56.29]Whoa!
[69:58.77]The fire's spreading!
[70:03.03]Dude, TV.
[70:05.21]The electrified TV.
[70:10.73]I hate to play this, but we are dying this mission.
[70:14.37]I don't think we're going to die, but... Hold on.
[70:21.02]Where's the switch to turn this off?
[70:25.66]There's a light switch somewhere over here, and I just don't know where it is.
[70:32.21]Where's the switch?
[70:32.81]I don't know where it is.
[70:43.25]What do you main in Overwatch?
[70:48.22]Zenyatta.
[70:52.24]Nice, dude.
[71:05.85]Oh, that's your ladder.
[71:07.81]That is my ladder.
[71:10.77]You're letting people die right now.
[71:15.46]I'm really like... I'm really gaming, man.
[71:35.33]Sick.
[71:39.26]Like I want you to think that these people up here, one of them is like your mother.
[71:47.78]How hard would you be trying?
[71:55.18]You're gonna die.
[72:03.87]Is there a limit to your... This person's fine.
[72:18.12]There's one more person up here.
[72:19.56]Wait, can you leave without me?
[72:22.62]Objectives incomplete.
[72:23.66]I have to finish my objectives to leave the job.
[72:33.70]Gotta reload?
[72:34.56]You can reload?
[72:36.64]Look over here.
[72:40.27]Oh, shit.
[72:42.15]Look at that!
[72:47.82]He wishes he was on Reddit right now.
[72:52.58]Hey, want to do like a cereal tier list?
[72:54.04]Yeah, I love those.
[72:57.23]I've already done like 10 of them.
[73:00.65]The pause before you spoke, I could feel your eyes lighting up.
[73:03.49]Alright, we're going to do this one more.
[73:18.58]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[73:20.30]Hey.
[73:21.82]Any time to hang out with Ster is a good time.
[73:27.81]We can do anything you want to do.
[73:29.71]Like, I can leave and never talk to you for, like, two more years.
[73:34.30]Play a different game.
[73:35.20]Tell you about my favorite cereals.
[73:38.78]Family Guy tier list?
[73:41.70]that's the dumbest thing because it's Peter is s and every single other character is d the character is not like individual episodes you don't want to rank every episode I mean that would be hell that would be so awful I can't think of anything that would be worse than that well
[74:11.23]Got no imagination.
[74:15.57]I strongly agree.
[74:17.87]This place is massive.
[74:20.37]Is there a place to get up here?
[74:22.49]Did we complete like the tutorial missions and then we immediately went to like extra hard, no hope difficulty?
[74:28.79]No, like these are just in these.
[74:30.71]I think you can grind missions like you can do the same mission over and over again.
[74:43.38]That was completely unnecessary.
[74:44.58]I just did.
[74:46.64]Ow.
[74:47.78]Alright.
[74:48.12]Anybody up top?
[74:49.98]I'm getting them.
[75:04.07]What?
[75:04.61]What?
[75:05.95]For real?
[75:06.41]I'm going here.
[75:17.87]What is this connecting to across?
[75:22.63]I don't know.
[75:24.82]No one lives in mazes like this.
[75:37.00]I don't think we can even walk in here.
[75:38.59]It looks like it's going this way.
[75:42.68]Hey, where's the ladder?
[75:43.58]I don't know.
[75:45.26]Where's the ladder?
[75:45.92]Alright.
[75:52.45]There has to be a switch somewhere or... Shit.
[76:06.78]God damn it.
[76:07.70]Now I'm stuck in here.
[76:10.36]You can do it.
[76:11.56]You can do it.
[76:15.58]I got five we got them but they're still wait what I think there's still like three people ow

[77:12.04]Whatever you said, I'm not sure.
[77:15.84]Yeah, I don't know, man.
[77:19.74]Maybe try calling back or something.
[77:25.20]Where's the thing that you put the money in?
[77:27.98]I don't know.
[77:28.82]No.
[77:31.86]No.
[77:34.06]I had the money.
[77:34.76]Everything was done.
[77:35.70]I was done.
[77:36.26]I had it.
[77:38.39]I turned that on or off?
[77:41.07]Are you dead?
[77:41.85]Mother!
[77:42.95]Fridge!
[77:44.99]I got a flare.
[77:45.71]Just come to the flare.
[77:46.47]You can see where I am.
[77:47.11]Can you see the flare?
[77:53.52]At least you got the money.
[77:57.22]I did get the money.
[78:00.90]Oh, no.
[78:02.80]Oh, that was mine.
[78:04.18]That was mine, buddy!
[78:11.18]Alright, that's pretty good.
[78:14.90]There's one more guy.
[78:15.86]Do you care?
[78:17.16]Let's go.
[78:17.48]You know what?
[78:18.78]Where are they?
[78:20.56]Up there.
[78:20.88]Do you have your ladder?
[78:21.92]Uh, yeah.
[78:26.33]Whoa, what the?
[78:34.05]You behaving like this is why Ster is the way he is.
[78:39.20]I mean, I honestly, I don't know how to act right now.
[78:43.60]I don't, uh, I've never been in this scenario before.
[78:46.91]I feel like I'm being held hostage where, like, we can't stop playing, but, like, he doesn't want to be here.
[78:53.29]It's not true.
[78:53.77]Alright, now we have to leave.
[79:07.32]Uh, good.
[79:07.70]Alright, go.
[79:10.85]Like how about the next mission?
[79:11.95]You just like hang out out front.
[79:15.66]And like, how about this?
[79:16.92]How about this?
[79:18.08]The next mission you hang out out front and I'll show you what I can do.
[79:22.12]OK, I'll I'll be your supervisor.
[79:24.76]You hang out and you take a you watch.
[79:26.08]I'll show you what I'm capable of, what I can do.
[79:28.13]Alright.
[79:29.49]See if you get a raise.
[79:32.88]Let's make this a little interesting, you know what I'm saying?
[79:36.51]Hold on a second.
[79:37.45]This is a boss mission.
[79:38.59]I think we're at a boss.
[79:40.75]A boss?
[79:41.23]What is a boss?
[79:42.07]We're about to find out.
[79:43.29]Like Charizard?
[79:46.27]I don't know.
[79:46.57]It says boss.
[79:52.04]Stop your competition and save yourself.
[79:55.88]Get out of here, dude.
[80:08.49]I think- I think we broke his cutscene.
[80:12.72]He threw a computer at you.
[80:45.00]I don't hear anything.
[80:48.14]Oh, man.
[80:48.54]Dude, you kind of stink.
[80:50.82]I thought you were going to do this mission.
[80:52.52]No, but this is a boss mission.
[80:53.60]It's different.
[80:56.04]He's randomly rippening to me.
[81:05.02]I got it.
[81:05.28]Tossed.
[81:05.44]Nice hit.
[81:05.62]Nice hit.
[81:12.47]Got him.
[81:14.37]Watch out.
[81:14.71]It's going to explode.
[81:15.49]Alright.
[81:16.19]I got this over here.
[81:17.83]Okay.
[81:18.01]You got this.
[81:18.61]I'm putting out a couple of things over here.
[81:20.63]This one's coming straight over to you.
[81:22.53]Oh, what's he doing?
[81:24.33]This is so loud.
[81:25.99]It is wicked loud.
[81:29.49]I'm throwing something from back here.
[81:39.82]Can we finish this up quickly?
[81:41.43]I've got a hockey match after this.
[81:45.59]That turn around was perfect.
[81:50.35]Will you pick me up so we can beat the boss?
[82:00.14]Show me what you got.
[82:01.10]Sure.
[82:03.34]Alright, you hang back and you watch.
[82:05.64]I'll take care of it.
[82:18.02]He's throwing everything at me.
[82:21.14]It's like you don't even exist.
[82:22.54]I can't even see.
[82:23.38]There's too much fire.
[82:25.90]Where is he?
[82:31.86]Why is it electrified over here?
[82:36.34]Someone's like smoking in my ear.
[82:48.60]You haven't hurt him.
[82:52.44]Why is he up?
[83:13.28]Why is he burping?
[83:20.82]What the fuck is happening right now?
[83:22.94]What's that?
[83:42.64]Something electrified the top area.
[83:50.72]South Park Voice Live.
[83:52.20]That was nice.
[83:54.08]Don't move.
[83:54.30]I got it.
[83:54.66]Are you sure?
[83:55.22]Yes.
[83:56.14]Don't move.
[84:22.13]Dude, the issue is it covers the crosshair.
[84:24.03]I can't see where he is.
[84:25.01]I'm covering the crosshair.
[84:25.75]Skill issue.
[84:54.60]Throw it back, throw it back, throw it back.
[84:56.68]Oh.
[84:56.82]Can we finish this up quickly?
[84:59.14]I've got a hockey match after this.
[85:01.62]That's racist.
[85:02.44]They're being racist.
[85:07.34]Feral.
[85:10.18]I just smashed that in the back of your fucking head.
[85:12.34]I'm so sorry.
[85:14.28]He ducked.
[85:15.16]Why does he duck when I throw, but not when you throw?
[85:18.18]Oh, he ducked.
[85:31.22]well we're doing it no we actually are we're good
[85:50.03]Dude, you're being carried so hard.
[85:52.77]What if we just left?
[85:53.53]I feel like I'm supposed to be hitting him, but it's not connecting.
[86:00.09]For the record, you are supposed to be hitting him.
[86:15.67]I am.
[86:19.68]Oh, he's almost dead.
[86:27.43]What the fuck?
[86:38.05]You just sit down.
[86:41.01]Now pick me up so I get credit for it.
[86:43.38]Well, you ain't seen the last of me, eh?
[86:50.53]Nice job.
[86:55.05]You have to cross aim.
[86:58.88]So you mean very calculated and calm and able to deduce mathematical equations when I need to.
[87:05.64]That sounds pretty good to me.
[87:07.18]OK, so I think we just unlocked a new zone.
[87:19.88]We did.
[87:21.86]Oh, not quite, yeah.
[87:22.84]So there's a new zone.
[87:25.20]I like the sound of that.
[87:26.14]I like new zones.
[87:28.26]You want to do some new zones?
[87:30.06]Oh, the clothing actually has stats on it.
[87:33.74]Really?
[87:35.48]Yeah, like this helmet has reduced shock damage taken.
[87:39.31]So wait, I just bought, oh, this is air conditioned, okay.
[87:45.99]Oh, it does, okay.
[87:47.07]Yeah, they've all got like perks.
[87:50.87]this one gets bigger you dress up like an elf and you get better perks and like the the they tip you more because they like you're dressed like an elf please play this for the next four hours I love it we're just having fun I mean we're just we're just it's just a little bit of he took that comment personally and negatively it was a very positive comment and it like hurt you
[88:25.31]no it didn't I was just straight I was just saying do the turtle where is the turtle head turtle mask thing where in the middle oh you're talking about me okay never mind these clothes are expensive
[88:56.83]yeah they're very uh they're helpful I'm ready when you are dad so what's your uh what's your game of the year for 2023 so far Vampire Survivors
[89:23.93]I came out last year.
[89:25.21]Oh, I misunderstood the question.
[89:28.27]I haven't played anything this year.
[89:29.65]Do you actually want to do the thing from last year?
[89:32.89]So what was your game of the year from last year?
[89:38.69]Shoot, I wrote something on the Twitter.
[89:41.07]I forget.
[89:41.71]I have like a brain problem.
[89:43.83]Slice and dice?
[89:44.55]You played slice and dice?
[89:46.47]Slice and dice?
[89:48.11]Yeah.
[89:48.91]Is that a... I've heard of it.
[89:51.23]I think I was going to play it eventually.
[89:52.55]Is that a game that's on... Is that Itch.io?
[89:56.23]Yeah.
[89:57.41]I think it's on Android.
[90:01.38]I actually have had that since that Itch.io night from like a year ago.
[90:07.74]Very good.
[90:09.88]But you have to like think.
[90:12.30]So I don't know if you'd be into it.
[90:15.51]I mean, I... Did you like Vampire Survivors?
[90:21.29]I... Okay.
[90:23.21]This is a very Ster story.
[90:24.57]So I got Vampire Survivors.
[90:27.71]I was like, this is kind of cool.
[90:28.99]But I feel like the whole thing is just like... You don't actually do anything.
[90:33.53]You can just stand still, kind of.
[90:35.29]So I got Cheat Engine to give me all of the unlocks.
[90:38.39]And then I did a run.
[90:39.27]And then I stood still and realized that you could beat it while standing still.
[90:42.13]And I was like, okay.
[90:44.61]I think I'm done.
[90:45.35]Wait, hold on a minute.
[90:47.03]You... We're not playing the mission yet because I'm going to interrogate you now.
[90:50.95]But, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, have you played like any of the others, like Soulstone Survivors?
[90:55.89]You actually like move in that game and dodge attacks.
[90:58.75]You have this so wrong.
[91:02.57]You cheated after the first time you played it.
[91:06.97]You're supposed to unlock stuff and slowly get more and more powerful.
[91:10.88]But if the whole game is just like...
[91:14.09]There's no skill expression.
[91:15.57]You know what I'm saying?
[91:16.07]Like, you don't get to just, like... If what you do doesn't matter if you had the upgrades, then it's not exciting to me because you're just... You're not doing anything.
[91:24.94]Like, you are gated by what the game has given you.
[91:28.17]Like, you're predetermined to have lost.
[91:32.25]It's like you're playing Binding of Isaac, but your tears don't do damage.
[91:35.88]But if you die, let's just say I hated Hades, dude.
[91:38.48]Everyone in chat's gonna think I'm crazy, but Hades was just like, if you want to deal plus 300%, I'm muted, aren't I?
[91:44.97]No, no, I'm just letting you go.
[91:46.35]If you want to deal 300% more damage, then you have to die X amount of times.
[91:52.68]So you want the game to just, when you turn it on, just to go like, I like roguelikes.
[91:59.12]No, I like roguelikes where it's not about how much stuff you have unlocked.
[92:04.42]It's about how well you're playing.
[92:08.49]Yeah, you can correct me if I'm wrong here, but I think you could beat Hades on your first try if you were good enough.
[92:16.96]Do it, then.
[92:18.22]Is this the same thing people told me about Loop Hero?
[92:20.65]Oh, yo, the speedrunners beat Loop Hero on their second run when they know all of the optimal strats and have been playing the game for hundreds of hours.
[92:28.09]So, like, it's not about hours of progression that they force you to do because you could beat it in four hours if you actually, like, did, like, the Reddit strategy.
[92:38.48]People are dying in this building.
[92:40.91]You're the one that said, let's take a minute and talk about this.
[92:43.93]Like, you're in, like, a burning building, and there's people arguing about Vampire Survivors.
[92:47.57]The firefighters are arguing about roguelikes in the driveway.
[92:51.10]Have you played Brotato?
[92:52.50]I have.
[92:53.72]It's, like, the same thing as Vampire Survivors.
[92:57.92]Like, you actually get to dodge abilities, and it's, like, quicker.
[93:00.60]I like that a lot more.
[93:02.18]The explosion.
[93:04.61]Um...
[93:08.39]So you don't like when a game trickles you content after playing it for a while?
[93:13.98]I don't like when your chance of success is gated by how much time you've played and solely how much time you've played.
[93:23.94]Well, I mean, you probably feel the same way about an MMO, then.
[93:27.14]Like, MMOs, you've got to play a lot to get anything from it.
[93:29.64]Would you ever play, like, an MMO?
[93:30.50]I mean, I don't really like MMOs.
[93:33.04]You know I play, like, Path of Exile and Diablo.
[93:34.82]Like, I like grinding games.
[93:36.38]Right.
[93:36.93]So what about Diablo?
[93:37.87]In Diablo, you start as a little shitty, and you literally have a stick, and it takes you hours and hours to level up and put skill points in.
[93:47.40]But you're still like doing an individual character build and it's like your journey through and what items you find.
[93:52.58]Vampire Survivors is, there is, you will eventually have 100% of these things.
[94:00.56]You know, you can't equip every single item in all of Diablo II all at once and be like, okay, I win now.
[94:06.60]The fun of Vampire Survivors is you kind of roll dice to see what the game is going to let you choose from.
[94:12.13]I'm not even really... Oh, really?
[94:16.28]That's what it does.
[94:17.02]It's like, oh, what am I going to... It's opening up a little box.
[94:19.24]It's like, what am I going to get?
[94:20.40]But then you unlock, like, rerolls.
[94:22.18]Yeah.
[94:23.24]And you pretty much get to choose exactly the same things that you want every single run.
[94:26.72]I am not going to tell you that there's no power creep in Vampire Survivors.
[94:31.51]There is.
[94:32.61]It's $3.
[94:33.07]I like it.
[94:37.32]But I think there's better alternatives at this point for it to be your game of the year is honestly... Name me something better.
[94:43.22]What else came up last year?
[94:44.60]I think Brotato is very similar.
[94:46.28]And I think it does... It's better.
[94:49.47]I don't think so.
[94:52.15]What do you not like about Brotato?
[94:54.11]I just... I just like... I like Vampire Survivors more.
[94:57.87]I think Vampire Survivors has... I like the abilities.
[95:02.30]You like when you open the chest and it's like a casino and you can hear all the noises.
[95:05.92]Yeah.
[95:07.47]You know what?
[95:07.99]Yeah.
[95:09.65]I like the kind of, hey, the game is going to throw you some stuff.
[95:13.23]What do you want to do?
[95:14.15]And you got to make a decision.
[95:15.85]And it gets stronger and stronger.
[95:17.51]I know, but like, I don't, I, it's not the same.
[95:21.37]It's not the same.
[95:22.15]It's the loot box noises.
[95:23.95]It's not the same.
[95:25.90]something about this different I tried what was it soul survivors one of the soul stone survivors survivors I think I streamed that game and I was just like it was like two it's it that was too much it was too much too quickly I don't like having all the extremely powerful unlockables immediately I like to grow in power there's tons of stuff you can grow in power in that game it's too much it was too it's too much
[95:53.54]I honestly... This is a rare Jerma L. Rare Ster L. Uh-oh.
[95:59.63]Ster wins?
[96:00.63]What?
[96:01.67]You're going to have to put up a poll.
[96:02.87]Who wins this argument?
[96:04.07]Who?
[96:04.39]Alright.
[96:04.79]Put a poll up.
[96:05.35]Who's the winner?
[96:06.21]Who wins the argument?
[96:07.91]Here, I'll do it.
[96:08.69]What do you mean?
[96:09.65]You don't have mod in my channel?
[96:12.29]Why wouldn't I?
[96:14.01]I don't.
[96:14.45]Why don't I have mod in your channel?
[96:15.90]I removed like everybody.
[96:18.88]Okay.
[96:19.20]What did I do?
[96:23.90]What did I do that you were scared that, like, this fucking psycho, if he, like, just starts banning people, that you don't trust me?
[96:30.53]I demodded, like, dozens of people.
[96:35.65]And by the way, you don't have VIP either.
[96:38.51]I am aware that I see that now.
[96:40.83]You want to know what I do have?
[96:41.93]I have a bit badge because, you know, I've given you some money on your channel.
[96:45.98]Hey, dude, this looks pretty close, but I think 54 to 46.
[96:53.42]Alright, now do it on your channel and see if it's 54, 46 in favor of you for streamer advantage.
[96:58.08]Someone actually did do it on my channel.
[96:59.96]I am at 78% on my channel.
[97:03.96]78% yes?
[97:04.56]Yes.
[97:05.24]Yeah.
[97:06.02]Who wins Ster 80% right now?
[97:09.21]Vampire Survivors got really popular.
[97:11.95]And then here come all the haters.
[97:13.95]Here they come.
[97:15.25]Oh, it's too bad.
[97:16.11]I don't like it.
[97:16.65]I actually don't like it.
[97:18.69]I hate it.
[97:20.83]a hater I don't hate it I think there's better alternatives when you're saying it's your game of the year what else did I say was my game of the year that's all you've said so far to me I don't know anything else we've talked about it before like in the chat um I mean Elden Ring is Elden Ring oh yeah
[97:44.37]No, he chose Vampire Survivors over Elden Ring and God of War.
[97:48.47]You play God of War?
[97:49.31]No, I didn't play God of War.
[97:53.13]Well, you don't have to because Vampire Survivors was actually the best game last year.
[97:56.72]Elden Ring was the best game that came out last year, but Vampire Survivors was like different and like indie.
[98:02.14]And you like that.
[98:03.54]You like that stuff.
[98:04.72]So I was like, hey, Vampire Survivors.
[98:06.92]And then you just kind of, you just like stomped all over my sandcastle.
[98:10.47]I thought we were going to have an agreement, a friend time.
[98:13.23]And all of a sudden...
[98:14.96]I'm wrong.
[98:16.33]It's all progression.
[98:17.91]No thought.
[98:18.97]I need something.
[98:20.19]I need something to interact with.
[98:23.53]I need like a button I can press every once in a while.
[98:25.83]Yeah, but isn't it fun just to kind of sit on the toilet and just do that?
[98:28.81]It's like awesome.
[98:30.25]When I sit on the toilet, I shit.
[98:34.66]That's all I do.
[98:38.72]You ever just take a moment out of your life where you don't have to be like on a device?
[98:50.48]Wait, you mean to tell me you go to the bathroom when you go to the bathroom?
[98:54.16]What kind of weirdo is this?
[98:55.76]Ashley's the same way.
[98:56.56]She can't go to the bathroom unless she has her phone and can read articles.
[99:00.75]Yeah, because it's... You know what it is?
[99:02.99]Dude, if I could do that in the shower, I would.
[99:07.37]If I could have, like, a thing where I could just be in the shower and, like, play in, like, a game or something and hang out.
[99:11.70]This reminds me of a story of someone who was a professional Clash of Clans addict.
[99:15.92]And they, like, had, like, ten accounts.
[99:17.44]And they would, like, Ziploc their phone and play it in the shower.
[99:20.54]So you're not on that level.
[99:21.80]No.
[99:22.20]Because you could Ziploc your phone.
[99:25.74]No.
[99:26.04]But that's... I don't know.
[99:26.94]That's weird.
[99:27.34]I don't like that material.
[99:28.27]It feels weird.
[99:28.73]Okay.
[99:31.25]The main problem is... When you're... That's, like, a very private, enclosed space...
[99:37.50]Nobody else, it's just you get to be in there, and it's super, it's just you, and you're just hanging out in there, and it's a super private little spot.
[99:47.01]It feels good to kind of like, oh, I'm in the bathroom, just like taking a, you know what I mean?
[99:50.83]Like there's a lot of people watching.
[99:51.75]Is that because if you weren't in the bathroom, you would be like, oh, I need to be busy.
[99:56.27]Like I'm wasting time.
[99:57.16]Like I gotta be productive.
[99:57.96]But in the bathroom, it's like, no, it's acceptable because I need to poop.
[100:02.12]But you're taking extra time pooping
[100:04.72]you know playing Vampire Survivors when you could actually just like judge yourself a little less and like go do it out and Nate like out in nature you know take a hike but when you were in the bathroom there are no worldly expectations of you like you said well that's what I'm saying you need to like that's that's an issue that's a problem even dude even sleeping even oh what about like lying in bed dude you could like you could be no there's like a worldly expectation
[100:30.30]The only worldly expectation you have when you are in the bathroom is... Nope.
[100:34.86]Private.
[100:35.72]Private.
[100:37.28]You are shut off for at least however long you're in there.
[100:43.46]You guys are getting too political.
[100:44.44]That's rough, man.
[100:47.63]Because if your alarm goes off when you're asleep... I gotta get up, right?
[100:53.53]There is no, like, your alarm doesn't go off, like, when you're in the bathroom.
[100:56.83]It's not like, oh, shit, I gotta get off the toilet now.
[101:00.27]Yeah, I got some stuff.
[101:02.25]No, no, you are in there.
[101:03.95]What if you're late to go do something and you tell them, oh, I was late because, like, I had to go to the bathroom.
[101:08.16]Is that, like, always acceptable?
[101:09.70]If someone shows up or, like, doesn't give something to you on time and it's like, I was in the bathroom.
[101:13.44]Always.
[101:14.86]Oh, sorry, sorry, I had to use the bathroom.
[101:16.86]Oh, how dare you have to go to the bathroom?
[101:18.96]No, no.
[101:21.08]What if they're in the bathroom for two hours?
[101:25.19]What if, like, you're on set filming one of your, like, big dramas, like, stick a baseball up his ass, and, like, the guy who's gonna stick it in your ass is in the bathroom for two hours and holds everything up?
[101:45.13]I don't know.
[101:45.49]I'd be like, the bathroom is a complete and total fucking sanctuary.
[101:52.67]If you, well, I don't know.
[101:53.89]What if they're sick?
[101:54.99]What if it's like, yeah, I'm sorry, but like we have to do, it's like, okay, I understand.
[102:00.59]I guess.
[102:01.79]Like, oh, sorry.
[102:02.55]Okay, but if... I disagree, though, completely, again, because, like, I would shit myself to win a quick play match in Overwatch.
[102:09.30]I would not let you down if I was on set.
[102:11.34]I would shit myself on camera for you.
[102:13.12]But you... Hold on.
[102:15.78]So when was the last time that you took, like, anything into, like, a newspaper or... I have never in my life ever done that.
[102:22.64]So what, you just go in there, sit down, and just, like, go!
[102:25.49]And then get up.
[102:26.86]Is it, like, so painful to be alone with your thoughts?
[102:29.92]No, I'm telling you, I like being alone with my thoughts, so I like that private time in the bathroom.
[102:35.64]Are you alone with your thoughts if you're on Vampire Survivors, or are you distracting yourself from your thoughts?
[102:40.45]No, no, I can just kind of sit there and just, like, alright, let's go.
[102:42.75]I can, like, hang out.
[102:45.83]And sometimes, dude, at the end of a vampire survivor's run in the bathroom, I pause it for a second and just contemplate.
[102:51.81]When you sit on the toilet, do you, like... Do you cross your legs, like...
[102:56.93]and meditate like that.
[102:58.37]You are talking to the wrong person.
[103:00.75]Dude, I drink espresso when I take a shit sometimes.
[103:03.86]You are talking to the wrong person.
[103:09.45]What makes that wrong?
[103:11.21]Why are you the wrong person?
[103:13.63]Because I love my bathroom time.
[103:16.17]And like, I take baths.
[103:18.04]I sip on espresso while I shit.
[103:20.42]I play Vampire Survivors.
[103:21.78]I get my Switch.
[103:23.18]Again, to recap, just to boil this all down real quick for anyone who's confused.
[103:28.38]Vampire Survivors is the game of the year because you can't play Elden Ring on the toilet.
[103:34.88]Yeah.
[103:38.10]Alright.
[103:38.64]Okay.
[103:40.64]Just to tie a knot on that real quick.
[103:43.75]We killed another group of people, by the way.
[103:46.55]Well.
[103:49.97]That's too bad.
[103:53.48]Hey, Van, we can do it.
[103:56.24]Yeah, we got time.
[103:57.30]But no, Elden Ring was game.
[103:58.99]You went through the whole thing, right?
[104:00.69]Yeah.
[104:02.25]I beat Orph and Akoth and all that.
[104:04.45]So Ster Dark Souls 2 is like the best Dark Souls Ster underscore, right?
[104:12.35]How do you feel about Elden Ring?
[104:13.48]I mean, that was years ago that I would have said that.
[104:15.90]Okay.
[104:17.28]I am a controversial Dark Souls 2 enjoyer.
[104:19.66]And my reason always was that because it had a lot of content.
[104:22.90]And Elden Ring has a lot of content.
[104:25.63]So I'm going to have, you know, Elden Ring is the tops.
[104:28.85]So you think it's the best that they've made?
[104:30.99]For sure.
[104:31.33]Do you think it's better than Bloodborne?
[104:34.49]Oh, I forgot.
[104:35.27]No.
[104:36.20]No, you don't think so?
[104:37.08]No.
[104:38.74]Really?
[104:39.42]It would take a masterpiece.
[104:41.92]Like an absolute above and beyond to beat Bloodborne for me.
[104:45.84]And I think a lot of that is just the aesthetic and the world.
[104:48.26]Like if Elden Ring was the Bloodborne setting...
[104:51.84]But that setting does a lot for me.
[104:54.02]That's actually true.
[104:55.25]If Bloodborne was Elden Ring's the kind of world, the size and the scope.
[105:01.47]Yeah, but the problem with Bloodborne is because it was 10 years ago now, right?
[105:07.56]That's something like that.
[105:08.60]It's been a while.
[105:10.28]It's hard to say that.
[105:12.38]Oh, Elden Ring's better when if you think about at the time, that was just so unbelievable when it came out.
[105:19.04]But like Elden Ring was so unbelievable when it came out.
[105:22.42]Like, dude, I have not had that feeling.
[105:24.39]A lot of articles would argue with you about how unbelievable Elden Ring was on PC when it came out.
[105:29.79]Yeah, but I know they were like, the stuttering, whatever.
[105:33.98]Everybody dealt with that the first week, right?
[105:35.96]That's going to happen.
[105:37.28]That's blocked out of my memory.
[105:38.32]That just happens.
[105:40.08]but whatever it's a new release I know it was annoying uh but that first when you first opened up the map of Elden Ring and you realized that it wasn't just limgrave oh wow cool this is a big map it's kind of like wow it's like as big as gta3 oh this is cool and you're in the back of your mind you're going oh cool alright
[106:02.53]I wish it was bigger.
[106:03.21]I wish it was a little bigger.
[106:04.19]Yeah, then you go down the elevator and there's then the underground world.
[106:07.84]Yes.
[106:08.86]And it blows your mind just how big the game actually is.
[106:11.63]Yeah, it was a great game.
[106:16.47]I don't think something will come out.
[106:17.90]And now you play... No, dude, play God of War.
[106:19.46]I don't think it would even come close to me.
[106:21.44]It wouldn't even come close, I don't think, to Elden Ring for me.
[106:24.96]I played God of War... It's God of War 1, but it's not.
[106:28.45]It's like the new God of War from like 2016, whatever it was.
[106:33.79]I played the first like five to six hours of it, and it was phenomenal.
[106:37.88]It was phenomenal.
[106:39.81]I don't know.
[106:41.07]I feel like I still... I don't know.
[106:44.23]Let me tell you.
[106:46.12]Listen to me.
[106:47.28]Yeah, I'm listening to you.
[106:49.38]You have my full attention.
[106:51.16]God of War, I was told.
[106:52.08]We're going to stand out in front of this house again and talk about God of War?
[106:56.54]We have to save these people.
[106:59.28]Look at where the fire is.
[107:00.44]Look at where you went.
[107:01.47]Look at what you're doing.
[107:03.13]Now turn and look up in the sky.
[107:10.49]Wrong house.
[107:13.13]Let's do this and then we can talk.
[107:14.66]Can we talk after this?
[107:18.16]Yeah, I don't know why this is closing.
[107:23.00]We have to turn it on somehow.
[107:25.38]Or just yeah, climb it.
[107:30.52]I think I see a way.
[107:33.25]All the way up?
[107:36.23]Where did you go?
[107:38.69]I think so.
[107:39.23]I don't know how we're getting in this building.
[107:47.88]We're going around back.
[107:55.55]So anyway, we were back to you were shitting on God of War.
[108:00.87]It was a phenomenal game.
[108:03.23]Alright, put that down.
[108:10.35]It doesn't go lengthwise.
[108:13.00]I want us to get in this window.
[108:14.10]And you're standing in the way.
[108:15.94]Like, you made it fall.
[108:18.96]I am standing, like, ten feet to your left.
[108:22.38]Yeah, I bet.
[108:27.95]There, get that guy.
[108:29.21]You just... That person's dead.
[108:31.29]They're not dead.
[108:31.89]They just got a little, like, a little head... A little headache.
[108:35.89]Okay.
[108:44.14]Alright, where is everybody?
[108:46.16]Is anybody else even in here?
[108:48.06]Dude, there's nobody here.
[108:51.50]All the way up?
[108:55.33]Yeah, all the way up until this direction.
[108:58.43]I forgot what the point button was.
[109:00.41]We need a key.
[109:01.13]We need a security key.
[109:06.91]Yeah, this is like the Doom of Ember levels.
[109:14.30]This one is, yeah, this is hard.
[109:15.24]This one's no joke.
[109:21.80]Oh, there you go.
[109:22.36]Door's open.
[109:25.22]It really is Doom.
[109:41.66]By the way, hey, Jerma, did you save anybody?
[109:43.38]Yep.
[109:46.42]Okay, congrats.
[109:47.32]Can you put out this, like, grease fire?
[109:48.68]Grease fire?
[109:54.15]Where?
[109:54.41]We're not complete.
[109:55.67]This is not going well.
[109:59.45]We only need one more person.
[110:03.85]I don't even know how to get past these doors.
[110:05.77]There's a switch connected to here.
[110:13.67]We have to power this thing somehow.
[110:20.35]No, there's like upstairs doors.
[110:22.43]Oh, there's a grease block.
[110:30.86]Well, I mean, this is like the hard zone.
[110:33.06]We're not on like easy zone.
[110:34.26]We're in like a hard area.
[110:35.70]Have you found... Wait, is this a key?
[110:39.12]Oh, shit.
[110:44.71]I'm kind of stuck here.
[110:50.34]I'm figuring it out, maybe.
[110:54.28]Maybe not.
[110:55.06]I don't... Is it sponsored?
[110:57.91]No.
[111:01.39]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[111:02.31]You turned on something.
[111:03.23]You turned the yellow one on.
[111:04.65]Yeah, I got the yellow key because the yellow front door opened.
[111:08.73]But I don't know how we get this blue one.
[111:11.04]Which is what every door is a blue door.
[111:13.02]Oh, here's the key next to... I got it.
[111:21.08]Okay, restart the mission.
[111:24.30]Restart?
[111:25.68]Yeah, like it's almost burned down.
[111:27.74]Alright, so what were you saying about like God of War is trash?
[111:38.49]Pick it back up.
[111:39.95]I said that God of War... You said the first one was phenomenal, but like not so phenomenal, that you would even consider playing the second one.
[111:47.11]It didn't grab me after the first 10 hours.
[111:51.88]It was aw- what an unbelievable, like, first quarter or first half of the game, whatever it was.
[111:56.77]It was awesome.
[111:57.49]And it just, like, I couldn't- it just- but it didn't suck me in.
[112:01.87]True.
[112:02.13]I've never played them.
[112:10.32]The game is, like, ten hours long.
[112:11.90]What the hell- wait, what do you mean?
[112:13.02]Like, what the hell was I doing the whole time?
[112:14.38]The game is- God of War is not ten hours long.
[112:19.96]God of War is like 30 or 40 hours long.
[112:26.05]It's not 10 hours.
[112:27.31]How are you playing that?
[112:39.26]This place was designed as a fire hazard.
[112:47.24]Oh, I got it open.
[112:51.63]Hey, I'm up here.
[112:55.81]Ragnarok is even longer.
[113:01.61]I died.
[113:02.85]Where are you upstairs?
[113:06.08]Yeah, Ragnarok online.
[113:07.22]It takes a really long time to level.
[113:13.52]We're going to get rid of this.
[113:16.62]We need the yellow.
[113:17.40]Everything is a key card.
[113:23.13]Did you do the tutorial?
[113:24.21]You open a window, it sucks it up.
[113:37.76]Where's your device?
[113:41.41]My key fob?
[113:51.44]Orange key card is out.
[113:53.46]Why are you spoiling like spoilers?
[113:57.96]And by the way, just to be clear, it doesn't have to be a device.
[114:02.08]Should be the back of her shampoo bottle.
[114:06.86]You're sitting on the toilet reading a shampoo bottle.
[114:09.32]That depends.
[114:10.78]I don't know.
[114:20.56]Why?
[114:20.82]I don't know.
[114:22.46]Just because.
[114:22.98]It's just something to do.
[114:28.05]I don't know.
[114:29.53]I feel like it's kind of weird.
[114:30.99]I feel weird just sitting there.
[114:36.99]What are you distracting yourself from?
[114:38.35]I just feel weird just sitting there.
[114:40.73]I'm dead again.
[114:43.29]Hold on.
[114:43.51]I'm coming.
[114:44.35]The floor fell apart.
[114:47.39]Where?
[114:47.53]Can you ping?
[114:52.03]No.
[114:54.32]Restart the mission.
[114:55.62]We have three people rescued.
[114:57.56]Restart the mission.
[114:58.82]No.
[114:59.14]Restart.
[114:59.82]Okay.
[115:00.40]No, we're going to win.
[115:06.28]You're doing the Ster thing.
[115:08.48]What Ster thing?
[115:09.20]You're going to now find the optimal route.
[115:10.56]You're going to find everything.
[115:11.28]You're going to get everybody in like 10 seconds.
[115:15.36]We have to rescue six people.
[115:17.02]The building's burning.
[115:17.98]I'm dead.
[115:18.58]Do you have any of the key fobs to even get into the room that I'm in?
[115:26.48]Ow!
[115:32.85]You're distracting me with all of this reading shampoo bottles while pooping commentary.
[115:41.72]Okay, see, like, this is the tutorial.
[115:43.54]You just pick this up.
[115:44.74]You see the key?
[115:48.55]Oh.
[115:48.67]Yeah, right.
[115:49.71]See, that's why we restarted.
[115:51.09]Because that seems very important to figure out and not go all... There's all these key cards right here.
[115:57.29]I thought these were tennis brackets.
[115:59.73]I thought that they were, like, when the choo-choo train has to change tracks and there's the thing in the ground and it goes left and right.
[116:06.85]And that the train would come through the door.
[116:08.37]I thought these were frying pans, tennis rackets.
[116:10.87]I did not know that's what this was.
[116:12.79]Alright.
[116:13.13]I get it.
[116:13.63]I get it.
[116:13.93]Let's go.
[116:15.39]Oh, there's red ones in there.
[116:16.45]Okay.
[116:21.43]If you weren't like interrupting this mission with all of your like, Ooh, like, Oh, I'm going to make like a crazy take.
[116:26.95]Hey, type stuff.
[116:27.89]Stupid, stupid.
[116:29.23]I just opened both doors.
[116:30.79]Okay.
[116:31.07]Good job.
[116:32.97]Stupid.
[116:37.67]We need a blue key.
[116:45.08]There is nobody up.
[116:46.40]There's one little floor up here and that's it.
[116:49.90]You're actually lying.
[116:50.76]I'm not.
[116:55.46]I found people up here last time.
[116:56.54]We need a green key and a yellow key.
[117:08.74]Okay, so what is your, besides Elven Ring and Vampire Survivors, which we already kind of concluded, what would you say are your top three games last year?
[117:21.59]Slice and Dice and God of War.
[117:24.83]Oh, so you did play God of War.
[117:26.64]I had watched someone play it, which was enough for me to say that that's a really good game.
[117:32.32]I don't have a PlayStation 5.
[117:33.84]They actually don't exist.
[117:36.85]but I would have played it.
[117:38.38]So you are vicariously giving Game of the Year through someone else?
[117:42.82]Ah, yep.
[117:44.24]Okay.
[117:46.70]Because if I'm not allowed to do that, then the whole industry of having analysts and consultants is kind of bullshit, right?
[117:56.52]What does that mean?
[117:59.14]They didn't actually play the sport, right?
[118:01.77]Like a sports commentator, like how stupid is that?
[118:06.01]Do you think that the sports commentator should be on an NFL team?
[118:11.72]I think they should like be playing the game, yeah.
[118:15.14]like how hard would it be to like break the legs of one of the nfl guys like they get hurt all the time and then they're the commentator so what should there be a different commentary league where it's just only the sports commentators against no I'm saying the opposite I'm saying that it's totally fine for a sports commentator to exist and I in this situation I'm the sports commentator who watched someone play God of War and realized that that is worthy of game of the year
[118:40.77]So you were sitting there circling with a pen with that white pen on the glass.
[118:46.39]You know how you can like watch a movie and say like, that's one of the best movies I've watched this year.
[118:50.50]Okay.
[118:52.00]I did that, but it was a video game.
[118:54.18]So Thought of War is your favorite movie of 2022.
[118:57.96]I'd have to think about what movies actually came out.
[119:07.17]Because if we're judging by how you mean by that, then God of War was a movie to you.
[119:12.17]It's still objectively a video game.
[119:17.35]I'm pretty sure God of War is a video game.
[119:21.87]No matter if I watched it or played it.
[119:27.62]Get this out of here.
[119:30.84]Cutscenes are movies.
[119:38.77]What other options are there?
[119:40.28]Play it.
[119:40.62]What other games?
[119:41.68]What other games?
[119:43.00]Why are you sitting here going like, I don't know.
[119:47.11]What else should I do about it?
[119:50.51]What?
[119:51.88]Oh, no, I thought you were saying, like, what options do I have?
[119:55.49]I thought you meant, like, what options do you have?
[119:58.31]What other games were there last year?
[120:00.53]Like, I'm not allowed, my top three games of the year, I'm not allowed to choose one of them.
[120:04.63]What are my other options?
[120:06.43]You've got Vampire Survivor and Elden Ring.
[120:07.98]What's your number three?
[120:09.06]You don't even have a number three.
[120:10.26]Excuse me.
[120:11.24]Yes, you didn't ask.
[120:13.02]Resident Evil 8.
[120:15.26]Oh, but is that, like, a real game or, like, a movie?
[120:17.44]That's a game.
[120:17.94]That's a real game.
[120:19.52]What makes it real?
[120:26.28]Are video games art?
[120:29.36]I think so.
[120:29.86]Okay.
[120:37.34]You're entitled to your opinion.
[120:39.18]How did you get out of there?
[120:40.04]No!
[120:41.34]I'm sorry.
[120:41.72]2016 ass argument.
[120:54.78]Did you jump out the window?
[120:55.66]Resident Evil 8 came out in 2021.
[121:01.07]Don't laugh at me.
[121:10.65]I did a top three.
[121:11.71]What was it?
[121:12.13]Elden Ring, Vampire Survivors.
[121:13.31]I was shouting about it during the Game Awards.
[121:15.79]What was it?
[121:22.99]No, it was not SCORN.
[121:24.27]No, it wasn't.
[121:26.71]It was not SCORN.
[121:28.45]You guys just gave SCORN Game of the Year because of the sound effect that played.
[121:33.87]During when you complete a puzzle, when there's a big new environment that shows up.
[121:38.96]And I agree, that was cool.
[121:41.16]Oh, multiverses.
[121:42.82]Multiverses, yep.
[121:44.82]Multiverses, for sure.
[121:50.84]Really?
[121:53.44]play multiverse.
[121:54.18]I know you probably don't.
[121:55.82]I didn't.
[121:56.24]I think we talked about this.
[121:58.08]You weren't like a platform fighter, like smash kind of fan.
[122:01.73]I didn't realize you actually liked it.
[122:03.69]I thought it was just one of those things that you did.
[122:09.77]That was good.
[122:10.35]It's actually very good.
[122:12.43]I can't get through this.
[122:13.45]The floor is electrified.
[122:14.93]I don't.
[122:25.90]don't have any water Ster you downstairs there's like a uh a water cooler you know what I mean that you can uh you can juice up I'm gonna die I'm gonna die I'm dying I'm dead because this one this mission is rough okay oh yeah that's that's valid that I um yeah
[122:58.64]There's a guy in here.
[123:00.72]A guy in the room full of electrified explosive barrels.
[123:06.05]What are we supposed to do?
[123:11.73]Why am I getting hurt by that, but you're not?
[123:14.43]I am.
[123:15.89]Oh, you are.
[123:16.47]Oh, water.
[123:21.01]Water over there if you need it.
[123:26.91]I think this is where we die.
[123:29.14]Or we could just get to the exit because we already did the mission.
[123:33.48]Rescue all clans six.
[123:35.16]We have four out of three.
[123:36.84]Yeah, but I think that's enough.
[123:38.32]Okay, let them die.
[123:39.60]Let's go.
[123:40.00]Let them die.
[123:45.67]You got somebody?
[123:55.84]What's your favorite cereal?
[123:57.14]Top three of 2022.
[124:01.68]Favorite cereal.
[124:05.19]The cereals is very mood dependent, you know?
[124:07.29]I feel that.
[124:12.11]I need to get one of those mood rings and see the color before I can decide what cereal I want.
[124:22.70]Alright, this one.
[124:24.72]We're going to do this one on easy.
[124:32.99]Can I ask you an opinion on cereal?
[124:36.03]You can ask me.
[124:36.77]I'm an open book.
[124:37.45]I'll tell you anything you want to know about me.
[124:39.35]How do you feel about frosted mini wheats?
[124:42.37]Love them.
[124:44.13]Now I know why we don't agree with Vampire Survivors.
[124:48.11]What's wrong with frosted mini wheats?
[124:50.92]Frosted Mini-Wheats are great for exactly 10 seconds.
[124:57.40]And then they are awful.
[125:07.56]You don't have a bowl of Frosted Mini-Wheats.
[125:10.38]You just, like, eat two.
[125:12.32]I like when they get a little bit more goopy.
[125:18.65]Because they're too hard at first.
[125:19.85]They, like, cut up your teeth.
[125:20.79]They're like razor wire.
[125:25.23]You like when they get, like... Like, you're eating, like, oatmeal.
[125:29.48]How long does it take you?
[125:30.56]Like, if it takes you, like, two hours to eat them, no.
[125:34.12]It depends on if I'm in the bathroom.
[125:38.90]God, I thought we were out of the bathroom.
[125:40.80]I thought we were in the kitchen.
[125:41.71]You know that complete American breakfast thing?
[125:43.65]Like, you know, it's up there.
[125:46.89]I got my eggs, bacon, French toast, cereal, orange juice, and newspaper.
[125:54.07]Two newspapers from two different companies.
[125:57.64]You know, a full 24-ounce glass of milk.
[126:02.12]Like, you know, a complete American breakfast.
[126:04.46]I honestly have no idea what words you're saying right now.
[126:09.56]You didn't even take the money.
[126:12.20]I thought you took it.
[126:15.58]Don't burn this.
[126:21.52]I've actually lost it, so never mind.
[126:32.08]I actually don't want to go get it.
[126:37.41]Really?
[126:37.73]Are you just following me?
[126:39.77]Yeah, what do you want me to do?
[126:43.39]That's cool.
[126:44.25]Check these bathroom stalls.
[126:45.45]These people are all shitting.
[126:53.84]I'll get this guy.
[126:57.04]Anybody else?
[126:59.62]You can see through walls if there's anyone else.
[127:02.59]There's a lot of people at home.
[127:09.17]Oh, there's another key.
[127:10.27]I need a blue key.
[127:19.16]I got a red key in here.
[127:20.16]Do you see a red door anywhere?
[127:23.34]Where there's a red door, there must be a red key.
[127:32.77]Um, I... Okay, whoops.
[127:38.39]Alright, I have a red key.
[127:44.15]It's not about the money.
[127:47.90]Actually, yes, it is.
[127:50.59]There's money in here.
[127:53.09]I want it.
[127:54.61]It was hidden in the plants.
[127:58.17]It is about the money.
[128:05.19]OK, so now I haven't seen a red door.
[128:07.01]Do you remember how to point at things?
[128:10.34]Uh, R. R, OK.
[128:13.72]I'm looking for a red door on this easy mission.

[128:59.12]Got it.
[129:03.30]I gotta go find the blue door.
[129:08.08]What was the point of even doing that?
[129:13.93]Money!
[129:14.25]Oh my god, what?
[129:29.86]I thought this was you for a second.
[129:31.26]What the hell is this person doing?
[129:32.90]Alright, there's a... Are you right there?
[129:53.19]Yeah, there's a person and there's money.
[129:54.94]You want to take the person?
[129:56.68]Oh, you have a person.
[129:57.34]Alright.
[129:57.78]I got a person too.
[129:58.36]Where's the exit?
[129:59.80]I don't know.
[130:00.98]Over here?
[130:01.74]I think we can go out this way.
[130:03.58]No, I don't think we can.
[130:04.72]Can we?
[130:05.02]Because that's the door I opened.
[130:12.23]Yeah, we can come out this way.
[130:17.69]Wait, no.
[130:18.05]Did I just go in a circle?
[130:21.59]I dropped my kite.
[130:23.21]are you oh I went in a circle don't jump down here oh my god I thought that was the main lobby oh no now what dude hi how do I get out of here uh you can put a ladder down go over the wall if you have one
[130:51.86]Ow, what is hurting me so much?
[130:56.39]Okay, so how do we get out of here?
[131:03.31]Open up your radar by pressing Q. It didn't do anything.
[131:08.93]I know, I was making it up.
[131:12.89]Where's the actual way to get out of here?
[131:14.99]What the fuck am I doing?
[131:16.45]I'm stuck in the wall.
[131:30.67]Alright, I'm up.
[131:34.29]There's more human beings in here.
[131:39.37]I... I'm fucking dead.
[131:47.57]You died?
[131:49.13]Can you ping where you are?
[131:50.41]I don't know.
[131:53.13]Yeah.
[131:55.39]This place is a mess.
[131:57.41]How do I get out of here?
[132:00.21]Why is this place fucking peewee's playhouse?
[132:03.10]Like, how do we get out of here?
[132:05.98]It's like a maze.
[132:11.85]They conveniently boarded up every single window.
[132:16.33]Just in case of a fire.
[132:20.27]Is there a door?
[132:20.87]Okay, there's a door up here.
[132:24.49]This person burnt to death in my arms.
[132:27.57]They've been cooking this whole time.
[132:29.51]Oh, come on.
[132:32.66]And I was right.
[132:33.66]I just did a circle.
[132:38.34]What was your favorite kind of cheese there?
[132:40.91]It is probably Swiss.
[132:43.85]What?
[132:44.23]Oops.
[132:50.97]Is it like an emote?
[132:51.87]Can I do like the floss or something?
[132:55.31]That would solve this whole problem.
[133:00.02]Well, you can get to the exit zone and we can accept that we saved four people.
[133:03.22]You are overestimating how much I know where I am right now.
[133:08.18]Alright, go left.
[133:08.68]Okay.
[133:11.97]Left.
[133:12.95]Left again.
[133:13.35]Left again.
[133:13.95]Left again.
[133:18.02]Okay.
[133:19.39]Go right.
[133:20.67]Go right.
[133:21.35]I don't have a door.
[133:22.29]I need a key.
[133:24.11]Open the door.
[133:25.13]I don't have a blue key.
[133:29.41]I got the blue key.
[133:31.15]Go up the stairs.
[133:33.45]No, I got a blue key.
[133:35.04]I got the blue key.
[133:35.64]I have no...
[133:41.80]There.
[133:42.08]That was all you had to do.
[133:42.96]That was the room I was down in.
[133:45.26]That was the room I was in.
[133:46.67]And that's the main lobby where you can exit from.
[133:48.51]There's chlorine flooding my eyes.
[133:54.03]You can't see anything.
[133:56.67]Chlorine?
[133:57.53]Yeah, just like that.
[133:59.27]You can't see anything.
[134:00.29]It's all washed out.
[134:02.40]Like I'm on the toilet playing Vampire Star Wars.
[134:06.86]That was a pretty good attempt for a callback joke.
[134:09.30]A little flat.
[134:11.40]isn't Vampire Survivors isn't the isn't the round always 30 minutes no or if you play in the speed mode it's 15. there is a 15 a couple of the places are 15 one of them's a few of them are 20. did you even unlock any of the stages or did you just go I don't like this I'm unlocking and cheating I I played it all I have like most of the stuff I beat it I beat it because there's like 10 maps
[134:37.87]yeah okay so yeah you know then why are you asking me this question well I'm asking you this question because I know like at a minimum it should be like 15 minutes and then you're on the toilet that whole time not necessarily yeah depends
[134:54.56]Alright, let's do an easier mission.
[134:57.22]I thought that was easy.
[134:58.68]Didn't you choose easy?
[134:59.94]I did, but we just have no idea what the hell we're doing.
[135:04.31]That was this one.
[135:06.09]I think we're missing some gear.
[135:07.17]You know what I'm saying?
[135:09.25]Let's go here.
[135:10.63]This place we didn't do for some reason.
[135:21.09]Well, okay.
[135:22.47]I need to... Can we get a poll?
[135:24.07]Can one of the mods get a poll up?
[135:25.91]Oh, shit.
[135:26.19]I don't have mod chat open.
[135:27.68]They might have been trying to talk to me.
[135:31.56]Yeah, I mean, like, I could... I could help with that, but... Okay, there we go.
[135:45.94]Can somebody put a poll up for...
[135:48.91]What is an appropriate time where this time period is like you've been in the bathroom for too long?
[136:01.28]I would like option one to be more than 15 minutes.
[136:04.90]Option three, more than 30.
[136:06.04]Option four, more than 45.
[136:10.99]For me, can one option be only as long as it takes to finish?
[136:15.36]Yeah, okay.
[136:16.08]Like, as long as it takes.
[136:17.38]And the other option is finish as soon as possible.
[136:21.10]I'm going in to do one task.
[136:22.66]Done.
[136:22.98]Get out.
[136:23.66]No matter what.
[136:24.30]Two minutes.
[136:24.68]It could be less than ten minutes.
[136:27.67]What is that period that's, like, after this amount of time, it's... Okay, this is a little... What are you doing?
[136:42.54]I'm trying to protect the structural integrity of the building.
[136:50.57]Because I'll give you my opinion after we see what people say.
[136:52.51]I knock it in here.
[137:02.40]I think it in that window.
[137:15.35]They already know your opinion.
[137:17.51]I actually don't think they do.
[137:31.13]I got the two.
[137:34.90]Wow, really?
[137:35.48]Easy missions are save two people?
[137:38.42]Uh, I think it's at least... You alright?
[137:42.06]The thing broke.
[137:43.68]The wood broke as I walked across it.
[137:45.32]They pranked me.
[137:47.38]Somebody's still in there.
[137:50.66]I gotta check this pole in a second, man.
[137:56.22]Yeah, we got a fire on the fourth floor coming down into the third.
[137:59.59]Uh, we're gonna check this pole.
[138:09.97]I just realized you're one of these guys that is in the bathroom what do you mean while the building's on fire you're still in the bathroom I would get out I would not stay but what if like you're in the middle of like you're about to be like a really hard vampire survivor's level you've been trying to like you know unlock a character or something okay no I I agree I agree
[138:33.46]Okay, 41% are saying that 30 minutes is pretty much a maximum.
[138:39.46]I agree.
[138:41.81]45, I think, really... Well, here's the thing.
[138:44.25]I didn't clarify this that well.
[138:47.31]There are lots of times where you take a shower and you use the bathroom, right?
[138:53.04]You don't leave the bathroom.
[138:54.86]You get all this done.
[138:56.38]We are not talking about showering.
[138:57.98]Okay, so we're talking about purely just going to the bathroom.
[139:00.70]Okay.
[139:02.44]You can't get an out on this situation of like, no, I was taking a shower.
[139:07.39]I'd say between 30 and 45 is like, alright, get out.
[139:09.93]Yeah, shower, shaving, brushing your teeth.
[139:28.37]Well, we got a lot of time.
[139:29.61]Alright, what about?
[139:30.93]Is there any try to find the money?
[139:32.13]We have like a minute.
[139:41.72]Half an hour.
[139:44.54]But half an hour I would say is at that point it's too long.
[139:48.16]What do you do for 30 minutes?
[139:51.52]Well, I I'm shocked that 30 minutes was your poll winner.
[139:55.43]Yeah.
[139:58.42]I just fell into the goo.
[140:01.17]I really I don't know what's going on there.
[140:02.97]I think we're going to leave before this stuff burns down.
[140:05.37]Yeah, let's get out of here.
[140:10.23]Oh my God.
[140:11.11]This is an exit, right?
[140:16.80]Should be.
[140:17.14]Yeah, I got it.
[140:19.04]Yeah, 30 minutes is probably too long.
[140:23.68]Like, what about like watching a stream or watching like something?
[140:26.70]You've never watched a streamer?
[140:28.56]No.
[140:29.04]No.
[140:29.34]No.
[140:36.43]You've never like opened up like a YouTube video?
[140:40.23]Or like browsed something?
[140:41.63]Like, oh, I'm going to check the... No.
[140:44.26]God.
[140:45.36]No.
[140:45.58]Why are you so against this?
[140:48.50]No.
[140:48.76]No.
[140:54.59]like what like can't you just go to the bathroom finish then like go back to your TV or computer and finish watching something what why can't you do both alright we're gonna try the office building alright after this mission I want to buy some new stuff
[141:15.11]Okay.
[141:16.33]Then I will wait to buy things.
[141:18.53]Have you watched a whole season of a show?
[141:20.45]No.
[141:21.05]Actually, I watched... The only time I've ever done anything like that... Well, not like this, but... I watched an entire season of Breaking Bad.
[141:32.30]I believe it was in one day.
[141:34.66]And to maximize the time that I was watching Breaking Bad, I did watch a full episode on the toilet.
[141:41.98]Because it's like, I have to... I have to...
[141:45.66]Because I need to make sure that I'm getting the most out of my day watching this.
[141:50.83]So in mid-episode, I had to go to the bathroom, and I just paused it, went right in, turned it back on, here we go.
[141:58.59]While making breakfast, while making dinner, eating.
[142:03.42]And I remember lying in bed at the end of this day.
[142:07.32]And I was like 9, 10 episodes, whatever it was, almost 10 episodes into the season.
[142:13.45]And I, my whole body hurt.
[142:16.87]I was lying there, like my eyes hurt.
[142:19.00]I was like, ow!
[142:21.20]Like I had only been looking at this screen for like 10, 11, 12 straight hours.
[142:27.21]It was like almost a season plus.
[142:30.01]And I remember just being, I was lying on my side and I had the lock on the iPad so it wouldn't tilt to go vertical.
[142:37.46]I was lying on my side, holding it like this.
[142:40.82]And so to make sure it was still horizontal and just going, ow.
[142:46.67]And I was like almost done.
[142:48.83]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[142:50.71]I'm, I'm, I'm confused at the moral of the story.
[142:54.91]I mean, there was none.
[143:01.70]The moral of the story was, somebody said, have you ever watched a season of TV on the toilet?
[143:07.85]And my answer was, no, but I've done something kind of in that same world.
[143:12.11]How do I open this door?
[143:14.96]There's a bunch of pressure pads everywhere.
[143:26.86]I feel like I missed a part of it, because all I really heard you say was, I watched Breaking Bad until it hurt.
[143:35.49]You know, we have... Okay.
[143:37.81]That's... Isn't that just kind of... It's funny how that's sort of weird proof.
[143:41.73]That, like, you know, weekly episodes probably... You know, I...
[143:46.62]Spacing stuff out is really not necessarily a bad thing because I'll tell you, I binged Breaking Bad.
[143:53.65]I didn't see it when it was on the air.
[143:56.69]I watched it years later in like 11 days, the entire series.
[144:04.23]And I don't think I can tell you, I don't remember anything.
[144:07.69]It is just melded together into this mush in my brain.
[144:10.81]I don't even know what happened in the show.
[144:15.32]And I think when you say out loud, oh yeah, I watched a whole season of Breaking Bad until it hurt my head.
[144:21.28]It's like, maybe I should have spaced it out like once a week or something.
[144:25.42]Maybe not that much.
[144:28.90]I'm speechless.
[144:30.18]I wish I had comments.
[144:33.67]Worried about you.
[144:36.87]I've been stuck in the same room for the last five minutes here.
[144:40.11]Yeah, I'm not saying anything about it.
[144:44.74]These things need a face scanner, but it's not working.
[144:49.34]Do we have to bring somebody over here?
[144:50.96]Do you think that it needs your face?
[144:52.96]The person who's never been here before.
[144:58.79]But I can't leave.
[145:00.05]Because I don't have somebody else's face.
[145:03.69]Oh, there you are.
[145:04.19]Hi.
[145:05.39]Hi.
[145:09.98]Reminds me of... What was that?
[145:12.04]The Muppet movie?
[145:14.71]Oh, General.
[145:15.51]How do we get in this door?
[145:16.31]We have our new retinal scanner.
[145:18.31]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[145:45.56]You forgot to say forehead.
[145:51.53]I think we've like already rescued everyone else.
[145:54.55]So we'll have to like go get one of the people we've already rescued.
[145:57.65]So just walk out.
[146:01.69]Go on.
[146:04.09]Just walk out.
[146:06.02]Just walk out.
[146:18.19]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[146:19.65]I thought that was going to take you a little bit longer.
[146:21.33]A little bit longer than directly to exactly where you need to go.
[146:24.86]Okay, I'm bringing in... I'm bringing one of these poor saps back into the fire.
[146:38.40]Why are you so passive-aggressive?
[146:40.93]What?
[146:41.23]Why not?
[146:45.57]You can't.
[146:47.66]Where is this last person?
[146:49.50]I think they're behind that door where you need the face scanner.
[146:51.96]But we can't... I think we kind of did this wrong.
[146:56.49]I do think we kind of did this wrong.
[146:57.97]Burning!
[146:58.29]I'm burning!
[146:58.69]I'm burning!
[146:59.05]I'm burning!
[147:03.18]Come on!
[147:12.65]axe the top door can we I feel like it was uh closed I can't axe that door no I'm out of I'm out of juice I even have one of the breach charges to blow up doors but I don't think they work on anything other than doors you can already blow up I do not understand this item I'm out I'm out of water I'm in a fire he didn't do it either let me just make sure that's very clear he didn't do it either he didn't do it either do what I got in the door I just had to knock it down
[147:43.32]I was just at that door.
[147:46.40]No, the one we walked by.
[147:48.38]And you tried to go in with the button, and it didn't work.
[147:53.09]We have four and four.
[147:54.01]Okay, I'm going to die, though.
[147:58.63]Yeah, I'm dying.
[147:59.37]I have a... I had no water left.
[148:07.39]Um, where are you?
[148:07.95]In like the basement?
[148:10.41]In the basement.
[148:12.37]Oh no.
[148:13.25]Oh, dude.
[148:17.67]There's seriously sprinklers on everywhere and they're doing nothing.
[148:23.92]Ping, ping again.
[148:24.58]I thought that was an ice cream truck.
[148:37.98]Oh, dude, I just hit the bonus on the slot machine.
[148:40.48]Dude, there's so many coins.
[148:44.36]I just hit you.
[148:47.00]I'm so sorry.
[148:47.46]Dude, you are engulfed in flames.
[148:56.45]I don't think I can even get in here.
[148:58.51]There's a hole in the ceiling above me.
[149:00.93]I think you could be in that room.
[149:02.65]I need water.
[149:03.73]Is there water out here?
[149:07.98]need water that's what I'm saying man that is what I am saying okay I'm coming in yeah that was I thought that was one of those missions where we had to burn the building down
[149:37.90]Alright, so what's next?
[149:38.58]What do you want to do next?
[149:42.50]What do you mean?
[149:45.14]What do you think we should do next?
[149:46.98]What's next?
[149:48.60]I'm down for more.
[149:50.52]I'm gaming.
[149:51.12]I don't know.
[149:52.13]You're the guy.
[149:56.19]Okay.
[149:56.39]You know what I mean?
[149:57.83]What else is on Steam?
[150:02.25]You tell me.
[150:02.71]Let's see.
[150:05.92]Portal 2?
[150:06.86]No.
[150:08.60]I recommended another game.
[150:10.34]Is that one also off the table?
[150:12.06]No.
[150:15.18]I'm just looking to see what I have right now.
[150:17.32]What else we got?
[150:24.39]Do you want to try Played Up?
[150:25.35]Do you guys think that'd be fun?
[150:28.13]Is Played Up fun?
[150:33.58]Plate up, plate up, plate up, plate up, plate up.
[150:36.82]People are spamming it right now, dude.
[150:43.09]Plate up, plate up, plate up, plate up.
[150:45.71]Okay.
[150:50.33]You want to keep doing this?
[150:51.49]How about another mission or so and then we'll move to plate up?
[150:55.44]Okay.
[150:56.08]You're talking to me like I'm a three-year-old.
[151:00.72]How?
[151:01.02]How?
[151:03.53]Oh, by the way, my stream is going to crash because I'm about to download it.
[151:08.55]So just be aware.
[151:10.57]Is that how that works?
[151:11.71]Kind of.
[151:11.97]Okay, then I will also download it.
[151:21.52]Okay.
[151:22.56]I got it.
[151:22.82]Let's do a full playthrough of Elden Ring co-op.
[151:30.78]You know, that would... No.
[151:43.91]Well, everyone's yelling at me now because I said no.
[151:48.03]But can you even do that?
[151:49.03]I think it's kind of a pain in the ass.
[151:54.97]As they always are.
[151:55.78]You excited for this?
[151:56.78]Do you play the old Armored Core games?
[151:59.40]I actually did not, but I know a lot of people were really waiting for that, so I am vicariously happy for them.
[152:07.44]I'm one of those people.
[152:10.09]So yeah, that's awesome.
[152:11.61]I hope it's good.
[152:15.39]They do have a mod where you can do it.
[152:23.49]How hard is the mod to set up?
[152:32.34]Is it pain or is it easy?
[152:35.18]I've modded stuff for it before.
[152:36.44]It's not very hard.
[152:37.90]People do co-op with randomizer.
[152:42.36]Actually, that would be kind of funny.
[152:46.52]Ster do you want to do uh co-op Elden Ring with randomizer on uh random enemies or random items or both I think just just randomize the whole thing so we like like margit can just like be in like a dungeon just walking around yeah I I played a little bit with that early on when it was a lot less functional but it was fun
[153:09.57]There's also one that randomizes, like, every item drop in the world.
[153:12.59]I think it's part of the same thing.
[153:14.21]So, like, you'll go, like, you don't, like, pre-plan, like, oh, this is the spot where you get the sword.
[153:18.27]Like, you'll kill Margit and get, like, a pocket full of sand.
[153:22.25]Really?
[153:22.59]Okay.
[153:23.63]Yeah.
[153:24.33]But also, like, the first item you pick up could be, like, you know, Voidforge dropped from Shaper.
[153:29.30]Yeah.
[153:30.74]Alright.
[153:32.50]Let's do it soon.
[153:35.52]What's your schedule like?
[153:37.39]Okay.
[153:38.17]Uh, I'm... Myriad's returning on Thursday, so I really need to, like, be ready for that this week.
[153:44.21]But after that, any day next week... What is Myriad, by the way?
[153:49.53]Uh, Myriad's this, uh, tabletop show that I run on my channel.
[153:53.84]You know, I got some known gamers from Twitch streamers, you know, just, you know, playing along.
[153:59.14]Interesting.
[154:00.50]I'm the dungeon master, and also I made the whole thing, and, you know...
[154:05.39]You ask me that every time and it's like one of these days you'll know because you'll get to play and it definitely will happen one day.
[154:13.62]Yeah.
[154:18.04]And where can they find you?

[154:26.18]Ster like the Dutch word for star.
[154:29.60]Wait, is that what that is?
[154:31.77]It is star in a lot of different languages.
[154:33.79]Really?
[154:34.77]Yeah.
[154:35.95]I didn't know that.
[154:36.43]That's cool.
[154:37.49]A little bit of lore drop there.
[154:38.67]Ow.
[154:40.65]Computer.
[154:43.47]I don't see where the switch is.

[154:50.60]I got it.
[154:50.92]Oh, my God.
[154:53.54]We're getting electrified.
[154:54.52]Uh.

[155:19.45]OK, cool.
[155:20.95]Or after Thursday.
[155:24.17]Let's let's figure out how to set it up.
[155:31.30]Oh, that hurts me.
[155:32.72]I'm surprised.
[155:33.64]I'm surprised you're interested in doing it.
[155:36.17]well I mean you played elder ring but like normally I feel like we did switch personalities because I'm the guy who'll come to you like do you want to play this game also install all of this random yeah I mean I'll be honest if this was any other FromSoftware game then
[155:54.77]Put down your summoning stone.
[155:56.21]Hold on.
[155:56.76]Wait, no, that's not you.
[155:57.80]Are we on the same password?
[155:59.04]I don't know.
[156:00.04]There's eight summoning stones here.
[156:02.06]Oh, no.
[156:02.84]I just brought in this guy, Ballfondler.
[156:06.24]Oh, yeah.
[156:06.70]Whoops.
[156:07.50]I'm sorry.
[156:07.76]We just got invaded five times.
[156:09.75]Oh, whoops.
[156:11.13]That's why it's more fun.
[156:13.29]We can actually potentially do it.
[156:20.88]Oh, wait, you died?
[156:22.42]Oh, shit.
[156:23.00]Time to spend 20 minutes resetting that whole thing up again.
[156:27.91]That's why that was always never fun to do.
[156:31.38]All true.
[156:32.14]What a dog shit game.
[156:49.40]Okay, there's people in here.
[156:50.38]Where are these people?
[156:51.02]Oh, on the ground.
[156:55.85]The seamless co-op mod is really easy to... Okay, that's encouraging.
[157:00.43]Good to know.
[157:05.03]Yeah, Souls modding stuff is always pretty simple.
[157:07.09]We've got like thousands of people on the job.
[157:11.81]So do you want to make some rules here?
[157:14.35]Some rules?
[157:15.23]Because I imagine... Oh, there's money in here.
[157:16.70]Get the money.
[157:17.64]I imagine if we pull this off and we do this, right?
[157:23.41]Do we get, okay, let's say we start and where, you know, when the first place you spawn, where like the Tree Sentinel is, is like one of the dragons.
[157:32.92]Like, do we have to beat that?
[157:35.90]Or do you, like, what are the rules?
[157:37.62]Like, can we reset and like redo a seed?
[157:41.81]Like, what do we have to rule?
[157:43.49]You can run away from things, but then chat's going to spam.
[157:48.21]But then, like, if the first boss in the direction we go is, like, Millenia.
[157:53.16]Right.
[157:54.32]There is a degree of, like, why are we here?
[157:56.48]Like, we just physically can't do it.
[158:03.63]The enemies scale, so the dragon is just as powerful as the Tree Sentinel.
[158:07.11]Really?
[158:08.74]Okay, if that's the case, then... That's kind of funny.
[158:11.92]That sounds good.
[158:12.92]Sounds good to me.
[158:13.96]They scale.
[158:14.60]Alright.
[158:15.46]Okay, time to leave.
[158:16.06]We got all the guys.
[158:26.02]Health and damage both scale.
[158:28.55]I'm down.
[158:28.87]I'm down.
[158:32.83]Are you ready for played up?
[158:36.03]Sure you want to take a quick beer be.
[158:39.24]Sure, I'll go.
[158:40.12]You know, drain the old.
[158:41.98]You know I'm saying you're saying.
[158:46.18]Hello?
[158:52.21]Why do you still have that?
[158:54.65]Hello?
[158:59.60]I don't know, dude.
[159:00.20]Ster, you recorded that like four years ago.
[159:03.84]It's still just sitting on your GoXLR, just ready to use.
[159:06.58]Well, I would have to replace it with something else.
[159:11.55]I haven't really been doing that anymore.
[159:13.67]Hello?
[159:14.81]Hello?
[159:19.49]Wouldn't you have accidentally just overwritten it at some point in four plus years?
[159:23.39]No, because you have to overwrite specifically that.
[159:26.11]There's 32 buttons or something, 16 options.
[159:30.61]I would have to overwrite that one and then save it.
[159:34.94]I got other ones.
[159:36.32]It's not the only one.
[159:37.54]I got that.
[159:41.02]for connecting a fax machine.
[159:43.72]I got some Alex Jones last order was I got that come and they came all of them.
[159:49.31]Even the dragons.
[159:51.83]That's not Alex.
[159:54.13]That wasn't your blood.
[159:55.71]You understand that I will.
[159:58.75]I'll eat my neighbors.
[160:00.03]I'll do it.
[160:01.69]So that one was what was the name of that game?
[160:04.29]You have all these got that one's from Gothic.
[160:06.90]That's a favorite.
[160:08.12]I will eat.
[160:09.62]I'm a good girl.
[160:10.72]When cocks collide, cum erupts.
[160:14.01]The desire for gay sex leads the warriors to the penis desert.
[160:19.67]So I got a few.
[160:20.23]Why do you have all these?
[160:23.03]I don't know!
[160:28.26]The one that I'm surprised I still have is even longer than like four years ago.
[160:32.76]Like five or six years ago, some random guy in my Overwatch game said, Destroyed idiot, get the fuck on Orisa.
[160:39.63]And that's been on there for years.
[160:41.21]I don't know this person.
[160:42.43]What is wrong with you?
[160:43.83]I don't know.
[160:44.33]I don't replace them.
[160:46.63]Go take a 30-minute shit and recalibrate, please.
[160:51.39]Alright.
[160:51.65]Alright, we'll be right back.
[160:59.77]What did you call me?
