[ve:60.16.100]

[01:07.75]Good morning!
[01:09.79]Did I scare you?
[01:11.99]I hope so, because it's one day before Halloween.
[01:15.53]October 28th.
[01:17.09]Halloween's on the 29th of every year, apparently.
[01:20.33]Happy Halloween.
[01:22.93]Hi.
[01:23.19]No, not happy Halloween.
[01:24.01]Happy pre-Eve Halloween.
[01:25.39]That's all I'm going to say, because I'm not going to be streaming tomorrow or the next day, so happy pre-Eve Halloween.
[01:40.63]We're not playing Phantasmagoria again.
[01:42.53]No.
[01:43.19]I can't handle that anymore.
[01:45.94]I can't handle the fact that that whole game was supposed to be a horror game.
[01:50.92]And it was just talk to coworkers and have sex with people.
[01:54.38]That was the game.
[01:56.39]Oh, and tell my therapist all these awful things that happened to me in my life.
[02:05.47]Can I delay the stream?
[02:06.67]You've got to wash your turtle.
[02:10.58]How do you wash a turtle?
[02:14.10]Turtles, it's just like a shell and some skin underneath, right?
[02:18.64]How do you bathe a turtle?
[02:20.26]Are they in water?
[02:21.36]Aren't they constantly being bathed?
[02:27.81]It just sits in water.
[02:29.73]It's in a constant laundry cycle.
[02:32.31]You don't have to do anything about it.
[02:36.91]Oh, you cleaned the tank.
[02:38.15]Okay, well, that makes more sense.
[02:39.43]Well, no, no, no, don't clean the tank.
[02:40.79]Don't the turtles eat the algae?
[02:43.22]Turtles, like, stick onto the side of the tank and, like, lick the algae, right?
[02:47.58]That's what they eat.
[02:48.18]I wonder if my turtle died.
[02:51.72]I never had a turtle.
[02:56.76]It's a joke.
[02:57.54]I'm kidding.
[02:58.14]I never had a turtle.
[03:08.57]Jeremy, the marine biologist.
[03:11.73]No, turtles are cool.
[03:13.49]I like those big turtles, the big tortoises.
[03:16.35]The ones that you see swimming.
[03:18.75]Look at it.
[03:19.07]You want to know how badass a fucking turtle really is?
[03:21.55]Like, let's go over this.
[03:24.31]A turtle is so badass.
[03:28.99]Like, start here.
[03:29.85]Let's start conversation here.
[03:34.08]When you go to the aquarium...
[03:35.70]And you walk in the front doors and you see the giant tank with all the terrifying fish.
[03:40.98]You got like giant sharks, like great whites, there's like whales in that fucking tank.
[03:45.34]And they're like floating around like we're swimming around menacingly.
[03:48.72]And then who's in that tank that you see that nobody fucks with?
[03:52.16]The tortoise.
[03:52.98]The giant tortoise is swimming around with like giant sharks.
[03:57.54]And nobody attacks the tortoise.
[04:01.44]He does whatever he wants.
[04:06.89]That's pretty badass to me.
[04:08.45]I wouldn't go in that tank.
[04:09.89]And think of how many fish, like how many predatory fish.
[04:13.51]If there was like a tuna in that tank, the shark would eat it.
[04:18.90]Tortoises?
[04:19.46]Yeah, the giant tortoises.
[04:21.18]They like dive down and they swim around.
[04:22.84]You see them in the tanks.
[04:23.60]They're huge.
[04:27.30]Tortoises can't swim.
[04:28.72]What are you guys talking about?
[04:30.01]What do you mean tortoises can't swim?
[04:32.23]They're in the tank.
[04:33.41]They're in the gigantic tank.
[04:37.95]Wait a minute.
[04:39.03]I don't... No.
[04:41.65]No, no.
[04:42.39]What is the giant turtle that swims around in the aquarium tank?
[04:47.29]Hold on.
[04:47.69]I'm about to prove you guys wrong.
[04:56.76]Here we go.
[05:00.76]See?
[05:03.30]Look.
[05:07.20]Okay, hold on.
[05:08.98]Hold on.
[05:12.04]See?
[05:12.42]Oh, this is a land animal, huh, guys?
[05:21.31]Yeah, pretty sick land animal.
[05:24.71]Look it.
[05:28.57]What are you guys on about?
[05:29.41]Look it.
[05:29.69]This is what I'm talking about.
[05:32.06]That's underwater.
[05:34.88]See?
[05:39.26]They aren't the same thing.
[05:40.14]That's a giant turtle!
[05:43.90]Tortoise, turtle, tomato, tomato, potato, potato.
[05:46.42]It's the same animal.
[05:48.18]It's a turtle.
[05:48.80]I said turtle.
[05:50.30]I said tortoise afterwards.
[05:51.96]Whatever.
[05:53.24]I'm talking about the turtle, the thing, the T-U-R-T animal that's inside the aquarium tank.
[06:03.75]Tortoise, turtle.
[06:05.19]It's like, it's like call, uh, look.
[06:07.25]That's like saying...
[06:08.89]Okay, you didn't say exactly turtle, you said TURTIS.
[06:13.54]They're the same fucking... They're the same species of animal.
[06:16.64]A tortoise and a turtle are on the same branch of Darwin.
[06:23.79]They're the same animal.
[06:27.87]Turtle and tortoise.
[06:29.69]What's the difference?
[06:39.81]Turtle versus tortoise.
[06:40.69]Tortoises and turtles are both reptiles from the order of testundines.
[06:46.07]Okay?
[06:46.99]But in different classifications.
[06:49.11]The major difference between that is that tortoises dwell on land while turtles live in the water.
[06:53.11]They're both testundines, okay?
[06:55.51]Testundines.
[06:57.57]They're both the same brand of animal.
[06:59.90]They're just different.
[07:00.76]It's like Cheez-Its and Cheez-Nips.
[07:02.04]They're both snackers.
[07:02.82]They're both crackersnackers.
[07:06.26]They're just different brands.
[07:08.82]God damn it.
[07:15.12]The point is, nobody fucks with that animal.
[07:17.86]No one fucks with the turtle in the tank.
[07:24.45]So is a cat and a cheetah.
[07:25.63]It don't matter.
[07:26.69]No, look, there's no other... You guys know what I'm trying to say.
[07:30.74]Look, hey, we're going to play Vampire Masquerade Bloodlines.
[07:38.72]Giant turtle, giant tortoise, tortoise, turtle, turtle, turtle.
[07:43.11]Tyrell.
[07:45.01]Tyrell.
[07:46.21]Lannister.
[07:47.97]Stark.
[07:49.77]They're all the same to me.
[07:51.05]They don't matter.
[07:56.39]Let's go.
[07:56.65]Uh, we're gonna play Vampire of the Masquerade of Bloodlines.
[08:02.30]And...
[08:06.33]God, give me a break.
[08:08.90]Like, semantics, I say the wrong name of the animal, but you know exactly what I was trying to say.
[08:14.80]And then I have to pull up the fucking testundines to show you guys what's really going on.
[08:20.76]This might be loud.
[08:25.66]Hey, there it is.
[08:28.44]Like, a guy has to pull up the fucking testundines.
[08:34.04]Did I download the community patches?
[08:35.34]I did.
[08:35.74]I have the basic community patch.
[08:41.20]Like, the regular one.
[08:47.70]So, let's go.
[08:50.25]Vampire of the Masquerade of Bloodlines, welcome to Saturday's stream.
[08:55.65]New game.
[08:58.17]The world of darkness is a place where immortal monsters pull the strings of humanity.
[09:02.57]And a new game starts with creating a new character.
[09:05.00]Would you like to answer a series of questions about the type of vampire you would like to play and allow the game to create your character?
[09:14.44]Oh, no.
[09:15.00]We're going to answer the questions.
[09:16.03]Of course.
[09:17.61]Would you like your character to be male or female?
[09:19.45]Male.
[09:20.51]Okay, here we go.
[09:22.49]While in a club, you spot your ex-roommate who skipped out after taking your stuff and leaving you with a stack of bills.
[09:29.29]He looks dead drunk.
[09:30.83]Do you?
[09:32.00]Grab him by the head and repeatedly bash his face into the bar?
[09:36.16]Or call the cops see you in court, buddy?
[09:40.86]Uh, wait, hold up.
[09:42.58]Is this a universe where I'm going to get in trouble for the first one?
[09:44.90]You know what I mean?
[09:48.56]Am I going to get arrested?
[09:50.47]Are the cops going to come get me?
[09:53.76]We're in like the weird vampire masquerade universe, right?
[09:57.09]I don't know, I don't know how strong, how big is he?
[10:01.61]No, I'm gonna call the cops.
[10:03.87]I'm calling the cops.
[10:04.47]See you in court.
[10:06.71]You know, you fuck with people with your mind, you know what I mean?
[10:09.21]You use your mind and like really work that.
[10:12.89]You'll never fucking fail if you use that angle.
[10:16.32]Coward!
[10:16.76]No, I'm gonna see him in court and I'm gonna get twice as much money!
[10:20.80]That's what you guys don't understand.
[10:21.66]I'm gonna take this guy to court, and I'm gonna, instead of getting my $100 back, I'm gonna get $400.
[10:27.28]Use your mind!
[10:28.50]Use your mind!
[10:31.36]Alright, you're outbid at an auction for a... This music actually is kind of causing me problems.
[10:37.62]Hold on.
[10:37.99]I don't know if I can even turn it down.
[10:43.82]It got quieter, there we go.
[10:45.64]You're outbid in an auction for a macabre piece of art that you just must have.
[10:49.78]You know the collector who won it.
[10:51.50]You've been to his house, even, do you?
[10:55.48]Get a few drinks into him and later persuade him to sell it to you.
[10:59.70]Wait until he leaves, find his spare key and make it look like a robbery.
[11:03.58]Write an unflattering critique on the artist, get it published and just wait for your friend to try to unload it.
[11:10.06]Huh.
[11:11.44]Okay.
[11:14.18]I think I could get a couple of drinks in him and I could persuade him to belay.
[11:18.06]I could tell him it's like worthless value.
[11:20.82]Use your mind.
[11:23.75]An intruder has broken into your house and has entered the room.
[11:26.17]You have no choice but to confront them, do you?
[11:29.55]Overpower and wrestle them to the ground, breaking as many bones as possible.
[11:33.59]Grab the heavy lamp next to your bed and smash their face in.
[11:36.47]Grab your gun and fire into them.
[11:38.07]You keep one next to the bed for this very reason.
[11:40.59]Grab the lamp.
[11:42.50]Obviously.
[11:44.26]That's like you grab the lamp, you turn it upside down, and you hit him with that big, thick part at the end.
[11:49.45]No guns.
[11:49.85]We don't use guns here.
[11:52.05]You're stuck in traffic after a concert, and the guy behind you is laying on the horn.
[11:55.95]Your friends in the car are urging you to park the car and help them stick the dude's horn somewhere uncomfortable, do you?
[12:02.46]Get out, pull the guy out of the car, and put him in the hospital.
[12:06.54]Or talk your friends down.
[12:07.58]You don't need a lawsuit or jail time.
[12:10.56]I'm gonna, I'm gonna, we're gonna say two.
[12:14.43]I'm going to say two because, you know, remember, it's all about your mind.
[12:18.10]I pressed one.
[12:23.38]You're at a nightclub.
[12:24.32]Again, we peruse nightclubs.
[12:27.73]Having a damn good time when you realize you're out of money.
[12:30.61]No cash, no fun.
[12:33.23]Do you?
[12:34.41]Seduce somebody and have them pay for your drinks.
[12:37.79]Time it just right so you can snatch a bottle when the bartender isn't looking.
[12:41.55]Go home and read a book or listen to music.
[12:43.83]Something more intellectually stimulating than wasting life in a lame club.
[12:48.54]Huh.
[12:50.86]Well, three is like... Three is like... You're kind of like a dork.
[12:57.88]You shouldn't be there in the first place.
[13:00.63]If you, like, go to a nightclub and, like, you're in the nightclub and people are dancing and you're not, you're just like, hmm, what book could I read right now?
[13:11.44]Dork.
[13:12.72]No, I'm just kidding.
[13:13.92]Seduce somebody.
[13:15.30]I would seduce someone.
[13:16.14]I'd be like, hey, look at your hair.
[13:17.50]Cool, look at my face.
[13:18.35]Cool, look at you.
[13:19.23]Hey, give me a drink.
[13:20.31]Cool.
[13:21.21]I'm going to be friends.
[13:22.45]Hey, man, I'll get the next round.
[13:25.29]Use your mind.
[13:28.03]See, the third one
[13:30.98]The third one is way too obvious.
[13:34.66]You could like go up to like a group and pretend to be their friends for like an hour and like they'll get the round and then you can just leave.
[13:42.29]And you don't have to pretend to be their friend anymore.
[13:44.51]Alright, you were mugged last night.
[13:47.01]It wasn't life-threatening, but you want to take some measures to make sure that if it happens again, you aren't defenseless, do you?
[13:53.85]Sign up for martial arts class.
[13:55.73]Next time they try it, you'll break their spine.
[13:58.22]Start carrying a knife and conceal it in your belt.
[14:01.60]Next person who tries it breathes through a hole in their neck.
[14:05.92]Buy a gun.
[14:06.48]The next mugger is sidewalk meat.
[14:10.28]Gun.
[14:10.46]We're all about guns.
[14:11.14]I'm buying a gun.
[14:12.44]As you're walking home late at night, you hear footsteps.
[14:14.63]Glance back and suddenly realize someone is following you.
[14:16.81]Do you turn to confront them, duck behind a tree to lose them?
[14:22.39]Well, it might...
[14:24.99]It's gonna be it's gonna be I'm gonna see who it is What about somebody you know?
[14:31.00]What if it's like one of your friends or something you ducking behind a tree to lose them seems Like that wouldn't be very nice or they would you do look a little weird confront them You're on a hike in the woods near dark this is elaborate am I taking like a personality test or are we playing a video game I
[14:49.99]You're on a hike in the woods near dark when you spot a mountain lion on the path ahead of you.
[14:54.09]Do you grab a branch and run after it screaming?
[14:58.34]Gather up a handful of rocks and start throwing them?
[15:01.16]Why do I want to do either one of these?
[15:04.68]Why can I just like not fucking attack the lion?
[15:09.05]I want to use my mind!
[15:10.93]Alright, we're gonna scream because maybe it'll run away.
[15:15.57]The world's a cruel and unforgiving place, but you've gotten by so far.
[15:18.57]Why?
[15:20.99]It may be cruel for you, but for me it's hilarious.
[15:31.26]You've been embraced by the Machiavellians, the Machiavians.
[15:39.80]Inflicted with insanity, Machiavians use their madness to provide them with surprising and sometimes disturbing insights.
[15:48.50]The inner voice may tell them of someone's true intent or it may betray them completely.
[15:53.25]So we're insane.
[15:56.13]Okay.
[16:01.07]Malkavion.
[16:02.67]Malkavion.
[16:03.53]Okay.
[16:04.49]Your vampire attributes and abilities have now been determined by entering and entered into its character sheet, which you will see next.
[16:11.24]After your tour of the character sheet, you may make changes to the character or simply play as is.
[16:16.19]What we have to play as is we took the personality test.
[16:25.85]Somebody, I couldn't even, I can't even see who it is.
[16:27.57]Somebody gave $50.
[16:27.91]I'll see you in a minute.
[16:28.79]Hold on.
[16:30.52]Thank you so much.
[16:31.18]That was Jake.
[16:33.48]Jake Odom.
[16:36.96]Strength, dexterity, brawl.
[16:39.16]Manipulation.
[16:41.92]Perception and wits.
[16:44.24]Computer, what?
[16:44.74]I don't have any computer knowledge.
[16:49.90]Hold on, let me see if I can get this to move without this crashing.
[16:53.52]There we go.
[16:56.02]Okay, right off the bat, thank you.
[16:58.93]I just want to get, let's get these.
[17:01.61]There's some fairly large donations came in here.
[17:06.00]First of all, jcodum.
[17:08.36]Or Jake.
[17:09.32]I'm going to call you Jake for short.
[17:12.00]Thanks for the $50, dude.
[17:12.77]I've been trying desperately to get notifications working and I finally caught your stream.
[17:17.59]Just want to let you know that you're literally the only reason I'm on this shitty site.
[17:22.01]Keep up the good work, man.
[17:25.21]Well, thank you.
[17:27.17]I appreciate it, man.
[17:31.24]Twitch is a good site.
[17:31.98]What's wrong with Twitch?
[17:36.60]Thank you so much, though.
[17:39.38]What?
[17:39.58]What do you mean?
[17:40.40]Come on.
[17:41.06]Don't say that out loud, guys.
[17:42.74]Alright, so... Manipulation... I don't have... These are attributes... Attributes that inherit character traits that are broken into three categories.
[17:53.15]Physical, social, and mental.
[17:55.39]Abilities are things you learn and also are broken into three categories.
[17:57.95]Talent, skills, and knowledge.
[17:59.13]Okay.
[18:01.47]We're gonna keep this as a...
[18:03.73]Members of the insane Malkovian clan possess a dark intellect, so your strongest attribute is mental, in which you have two points you can spend.
[18:15.04]You also have one point to spend in social and no points in physical, your weakest attribute.
[18:20.58]Oh god, as for abilities, being Malkovian gives you an advantage to your insightful knowledges, which you have three points to spend.
[18:29.11]You only have average abilities and skills and are weak in talents.
[18:34.70]Okay, so I can put some points in.
[18:38.97]Feats.
[18:40.51]Feats, this is like Fallout type shit here.
[18:45.67]I read only the $50 bit.
[18:47.51]I'll go back and get the other ones.
[18:48.53]I just want to get through the character creation first.
[18:50.11]I just wanted to make sure I hit that one first because it just popped up.
[18:54.65]I'm going to go back and read the other bits.
[18:55.69]Don't worry.
[18:56.81]Feats are the actions you perform in the game.
[18:58.59]Feats are derived from adding an attribute and an ability.
[19:01.93]An example would be the feat of lock picking, which is derived from the attribute of dexterity and the ability of security.
[19:08.82]Hovering your mouse pointer over a feat will highlight the attribute and ability upon which it is dependent.
[19:16.02]Jesus.
[19:17.01]Humanity.
[19:48.16]This is your humanity.
[19:49.50]Seven is the norm.
[19:51.18]Ten is saintly.
[19:52.20]And the lower you go, the closer to the beast you become.
[19:55.66]Also, the lower your humanity, the greater your chance of frenzying.
[19:58.22]When a vampire goes into a frenzy, he loses all control and attacks any and all things around him.
[20:03.89]However, as you gain experience, you can spend experience points to increase your humanity.
[20:10.42]Alright, this is where you have five crying babies.
[20:12.83]This is where your masquerade violations are displayed.
[20:16.07]The masquerade is a code by which many vampires unlive.
[20:19.87]Anytime a vampire is seen doing a supernatural act by a mortal, it is considered a masquerade violation.
[20:26.27]You have five chances, and each strike will have repercussions.
[20:30.89]If you commit five masquerade violations, you will be dealt with harshly.
[20:35.84]This is where all information on things you are hovering over is displayed.
[20:40.41]Okay, this is auto level we're not gonna do that you guys gonna help me Okay, so um Let's go Okay base this is me that's supposed to be me can I change this Well they got the hair right I Got I guess I can't change that

[21:39.56]So this is physical.
[21:40.84]I need to put points into something here, right?
[21:43.36]Lockpicking.
[21:45.08]Bashing.
[21:46.90]Unarmed and melee.
[21:49.68]Hmm.
[21:51.95]I don't have any points.
[21:55.53]I thought I said I got like, oh no.
[21:56.79]Okay, I get it.
[21:57.37]I can like take one of these away.
[21:58.51]Alright, well do we just leave it as is?
[22:04.47]Should I put like one point into firearms?
[22:10.73]I mean, this is just like the base of the game, right?
[22:14.55]Put every point into computer.
[22:18.58]Yeah, we're gonna keep it as is.
[22:21.08]I can haggle.
[22:21.96]I have inspection.
[22:22.68]I have ranged.
[22:24.38]And this is defense and hacking.
[22:28.84]Alright, we're just gonna leave it as is.
[22:30.56]I'm okay with this.
[22:31.22]This is the first time I've ever played the game.
[22:32.60]Might as well just give it a go.
[22:37.83]I took the personality test, guys.
[22:39.15]I have to keep it.
[22:42.98]Here we go.
[22:49.21]Is this sex already in the very beginning?
[22:54.25]We spent so much time on the censor bar.
[23:03.90]Yeah, I wear my gunner optics from bed.
[23:09.80]Oh my god.
[23:12.46]We just took, like, a bunch of drugs.
[23:13.50]A bunch of, like, socks everywhere.
[23:17.58]Ah, it's 3.42.
[23:18.08]Alright, that's not great.
[23:35.19]What the fuck?
[23:36.77]What?! !
[23:38.23]Well, that's the end of the game.
[23:40.15]Thank you for creating your character.
[23:41.25]Thank you for playing Vampire.
[23:42.27]Masquerade.
[23:44.05]My fellow kindred.
[23:46.08]My apologies for disrupting any business or interfering with prior engagements you may have had this evening.
[23:52.06]It's unfortunate that the affair that gathers us together tonight is a troubling one.
[23:56.86]We are here because the laws that bind our society, the laws that are the fabric of our existence, have been broken.
[24:04.78]As prince, I am within my rights to grant or deny the kindred of this city the privilege of siren.
[24:12.48]Many of you have come to me seeking permission, and I have endorsed some of these requests.
[24:18.05]However, the accused that sits before you tonight was not refused permission.
[24:22.81]Indeed, my permission was never sought at all.
[24:26.70]Huh.
[24:26.80]These subtitles are bad.
[24:43.04]The penalty for this transgression is death.
[24:46.82]Stake in the heart.
[24:47.82]Know that I am no more adjudicator than I am a servant to the law that governs us all.
[24:53.40]This is a fucking ghoulish looking person.
[24:55.14]Proceedings serve as a reminder to our community that we must adhere to the code that binds our society.
[25:02.11]Look at that guy.
[25:03.55]Lest we endanger all of our world.
[25:05.01]Fucking Skeeter.
[25:07.89]Forgive me.
[25:11.05]Let the penalty commence.
[25:13.53]Oh no, let the man who passes the sentence swing the sword away!
[25:17.29]Your head's gone.
[25:20.98]Which leads to the fate of the ill-begotten progeny.
[25:24.00]Wait, that's not how you kill a vampire.
[25:26.02]Most child are doomed to walk the Earth never knowing their place, their responsibility, and most importantly, the laws they must obey.
[25:34.94]In the heart.
[25:35.62]Look at that guy in the background.
[25:37.02]Look at that guy's fucking complete...
[25:42.21]Like, I couldn't believe what he was saying.
[25:43.33]The guy in the background's cross-eyed.
[25:49.24]He's like, holy shit, ooh.
[25:51.22]If Mr. Rodriguez would let me finish, I have decided to let this kindred live.
[25:57.24]It's you.
[25:58.68]They shall be instructed in the ways of our kind and be granted the same.
[26:02.64]What did I do wrong?
[26:04.20]Let no one say I am unsympathetic to the plights and causes of this community.
[26:09.43]I thank you all for attending these proceedings.
[26:11.79]And I hope... That guy in the background was that, like, meme gopher.
[26:16.32]What was it called?
[26:17.50]It was called, like, unspeakable gopher.
[26:19.82]And it's like... Everyone thought it was funny for, like, a year.
[26:28.03]He chose... I didn't choose... Look, if you're just trickling in, I did the personality test.
[26:32.45]And we're adhering to the personality test.
[26:35.13]This guy just is the smart gremlin from Gremlins 2.
[26:37.73]Yeah.
[26:57.79]Oh, so that chick was a vampire, turned me into a vampire, and they're trying to figure out what to do with me.
[27:03.32]So, what I'm offering is not generosity, but the opportunity to transcend the fate... Why am I walking like a worgen in World of Warcraft?
[27:13.46]This is your trial.
[27:15.42]Trial.
[27:15.74]You will be brought to Santa Monica.
[27:17.73]There, you will meet an agent by the name of Mercurio.
[27:21.35]He will provide the details of your labor.
[27:24.63]I've shown you great clemency.
[27:26.81]Prove it was more than a wasted gesture, Fledgler.
[27:30.03]Don't come back until you do.
[27:33.07]Don't open the emergency exit.
[27:34.13]If you open the emergency exit, it goes... Alright.
[27:39.45]Use the mouse to look around WASD to move.
[27:43.82]Use the toggle key default Z to switch between first and third person.
[27:47.26]Okay.
[27:51.24]Okay.
[27:53.56]What did I just do?
[27:54.71]Huh?
[27:55.05]Oh, he's... I thought I just got in trouble for that.
[28:00.05]Sure.
[28:00.23]Turn this up.
[28:01.41]I thought... What is with this text?
[28:03.79]This looks like a ransom note.
[28:04.81]The reign of ages plots again to wash away a revelation.
[28:26.12]This guy's fucked.
[28:28.54]Who is the dark demon I see before me?
[28:33.16]I didn't choose the insane type, it chose me.
[28:49.46]I shall undertake your dark tutelage.
[28:51.06]Break down from me to the bare-boned basics.
[28:53.66]I don't understand the play they gave.
[28:55.34]I need no guide in this dark path.
[28:58.36]Oh, Lord.
[29:01.85]Break down from me to the bare-boned basics.
[29:04.59]Youngsters these days.
[29:06.13]Well, your funeral, kiddo.
[29:08.55]But keep a couple things in mind before you go.
[29:11.42]I gotta go turn some stuff off.
[29:12.16]These lessons aren't just for your benefit, so listen up.
[29:16.06]My ears are all yours.
[29:17.40]You're going to be hearing a lot about this, so let me sum up real quick.
[29:22.93]Sure, you're a vampire.
[29:24.27]Great.
[29:24.81]Keep it to yourself, okay?
[29:26.55]It's easier that way.
[29:27.83]Trust me.
[29:28.77]That's the masquerade.
[29:30.29]Keeping vampire secrets secret.
[29:32.69]I know.
[29:32.97]I'll turn it up.
[29:33.49]Don't worry.
[29:33.93]Easy peasy.
[29:35.30]Now, if you violate the masquerade, if you run around spooking humans,
[29:40.83]You make things harder on all of us.
[29:42.41]That all of us get pissed off when we come after you.
[29:45.39]And you end up like your sire there.
[29:46.97]So I can't show myself to people.
[29:50.91]Okay, can I?
[29:51.47]There we go.
[29:57.08]There's no separate sliders.
[29:59.18]See, view subtitles.
[30:00.96]Why is it off?
[30:02.50]Shouldn't be.
[30:06.16]See, this is the unofficial patch I got.
[30:09.64]It says it's already on.
[30:12.59]Don't ask me why, I don't know.
[30:15.08]It's the source engine, yeah.
[30:18.04]I don't know, let's see.
[30:22.08]That depends on which one of my personalities you're talking to.
[30:25.15]Next, humanity.
[30:27.25]Being a vampire isn't the end of the road.
[30:29.69]You think life was hard?
[30:30.75]What the fuck?
[30:31.79]Now you're half beast, half man, and it ain't quite any different.
[30:34.69]Click the screen to turn, like, okay.
[30:36.16]You're gonna be fighting the beast for the rest of your days every time you get into it.
[30:39.92]Whenever you kill an innocent, you feed the beast a little more, and it grows a little stronger.
[30:45.34]After a while, the beast can take over, and you'll go wild and have to be put down like a rabid dog.
[30:51.55]So don't kill people.
[30:52.51]Be good.
[30:53.39]Be nice.
[30:53.83]Yeah, this is John DiMaggio.
[30:54.87]Nice as a well-kept cadaver.
[30:55.87]Do I have to eat innocent people?
[30:58.11]Can I eat this guy?
[31:20.01]Alright, so feed
[31:43.91]I will leave some juice in the fruit.
[31:45.69]Alright.
[31:47.69]So, I'm gonna relay this back to you guys.
[31:49.11]So, I'm a vampire.
[31:50.23]I have to feed off of people.
[31:51.21]Don't let anybody see you.
[31:52.05]Don't let anybody know you're a vampire.
[32:13.57]Otherwise, consequences.
[32:16.83]Right?
[32:20.65]Just want to make sure I'm clear about this.
[32:23.73]I skipped the tutorial.
[32:26.47]I did.
[32:27.87]Basically.
[32:28.41]Okay.
[32:32.41]Don't drink all their blood.
[32:33.69]Leave at least a little bit of blood so they can walk home.
[32:38.17]Quest log updated.
[32:39.81]Quest complete.
[32:44.34]Really should do the full tutorial.
[32:46.90]Was that... Did I not do it correctly?
[32:50.79]Blood buff.
[32:51.59]Okay, that's right click.
[32:56.33]Yeah, I totally skipped the tutorial.
[32:59.15]Well, I was speaking in like crazy person talk.
[33:07.03]Alright, well, you guys can help me, okay?
[33:09.59]I just need to know basic buttons.
[33:10.80]...and apparently unfazed by his high-speed accident.
[33:14.16]Rivers' agent released a statement stating that Rivers' crash was due to a mechanical problem and that the studio is not pursuing legal action against Rivers for the Trademark 8's destruction.
[33:23.24]Miraculously, this is the second crash Rivers has escaped unharmed in the last year.
[33:28.41]Our top story tonight...
[33:30.17]Is that hurting me?
[33:30.93]See, you have to be in third person for combat.
[33:32.85]What about my computer?
[33:33.63]You have five emails.
[33:34.23]Five around red.
[33:34.93]Shut up.
[33:35.29]Okay.
[33:35.49]Is this like quests or something?
[33:36.81]Type menu or command.
[33:37.41]Available menus.
[33:37.93]Email.
[34:01.20]Password required.
[34:03.68]I have to hack my own computer?
[34:12.99]Did I get it?
[34:14.51]Skill too low to make hack attempt at difficulty 5.
[34:16.83]This is my computer!
[34:19.41]Okay, well, I forgot my... I can't... My hacking skill is not high enough to hack my own computer.
[34:24.39]At your convenience, please come and visit me in my home downtown.
[34:28.31]I leave you this to guide you.
[34:30.73]Dark blood, our curse, alight this verse.
[34:33.52]Such power I sense in one so young.
[34:36.02]Come find me where burned the mystical sun.
[34:39.28]M. Strauss, Tremia Regent.
[34:44.00]Okay.
[34:45.36]What about this?
[34:47.33]Hey, the password for your computer is sunrise.

[34:52.88]I dropped you an email with my address.
[34:55.12]Come on.
[34:55.52]Okay.
[34:57.34]So we didn't have to hack it after all.
[35:00.98]Hey, the password for your computer is sunrise.
[35:02.74]Keep the cash in the drawer.
[35:03.89]It's yours.

[35:23.26]An envelope containing a bit of cash.
[35:25.36]Take it.
[35:27.66]Alright.

[35:45.30]Oh, God.
[35:46.60]No, you can't.
[35:47.06]Okay.
[35:47.82]Let's do this one.
[35:52.90]From LaCroix, Mercuro will contact you when you arrive in Santa Monica.
[35:58.16]Waste no time in meeting with him.
[36:01.03]Next.
[36:01.99]Dang, it's big.
[36:03.25]You know, from Hung Lo.
[36:04.69]Oh god, I need blood.
[36:07.09]What?
[36:08.67]Penis enlarger, watch the girls.
[36:10.93]Get out, hold on, I need to drink somebody.
[36:16.07]Oh my lord.
[36:19.21]Kilpatrick's prime putter.
[36:21.07]Looking for that lazy-ass X-puzz?
[36:22.63]No.
[36:23.09]No.
[36:23.85]Okay.
[36:24.47]Hey, welcome to town.
[36:25.76]Come on over to my place once you get situated and we'll talk about what you'll need to get job done.
[36:30.24]I'm going to pick up explosives right now.
[36:32.20]Some astrolite.
[36:33.76]I should be back by the time you come over.
[36:35.38]I'm at 24 Main Street in number 4.
[36:38.88]Walk to the end of the alley and my building is next one on the right.
[36:43.24]Somebody screenshot this and remember it for me.
[36:47.50]The game begins upon his moved.
[36:51.11]Okay, I physically... Shit, what the fuck is that?
[36:55.13]I need blood.
[36:57.87]Do I have, like, any... Just a store of blood?
[36:59.57]I just gotta watch.
[37:02.69]A toothbrush?
[37:04.91]Why wouldn't I have, like, blood in my fucking fridge?
[37:10.01]Nothing else?
[37:12.81]Alright, I gotta... We gotta go!
[37:15.66]There's no time to sleep.
[37:16.80]What about this?
[37:20.93]Bridge?
[37:21.41]Yeah, see?
[37:23.57]A bag of blood routinely used in hospitals.
[37:26.48]Take it.
[37:30.14]I knew it.
[37:31.70]Why would you not?
[37:32.22]Okay, how do I drink that?
[37:33.00]How do I?
[37:35.26]Okay, let me just look at the controls.
[37:42.13]Okay, holster weapon.
[37:43.03]We got turn, right, walk, jump, swim up and swim down, attack, tab...
[37:50.04]Use disciplines, mouse 2.
[37:51.50]Yep, that's like the spells.
[37:52.92]Drop weapon, backspace.
[37:56.12]Ranged weapons, F1, F2.
[37:57.78]Inventory is I. Feed is F. Okay, let's go to I. Here we go.
[38:08.99]Wallet is blood.
[38:10.25]Use.
[38:12.45]Did I use it?
[38:14.07]Okay, let's go.
[38:14.51]Okay.
[38:17.40]Yeah, I did the bare bones tutorial apparently.
[38:26.14]Am I gonna get in trouble for doing this?
[38:36.35]Should I go on this guy's computer?
[38:39.67]Wait, I'm gonna steal all the blood from his fridge.
[38:41.53]Are we all vampires?
[38:45.59]Nope, just get out before I get in trouble.
[38:51.77]Close.
[38:52.15]This guy doesn't even have a door.
[38:54.89]That's a fake door.
[38:58.32]Whatever, let's go.
[38:58.84]Alright, here we go.
[39:05.26]Violating the masquerade by revealing aspects of supernatural resistance to humankind puts you at risk of an ambush by human vampire hunter.
[39:10.83]You got some change, mister?
[39:12.99]Oh, Lord.
[39:13.37]Here, let me put some fortune in your misfortune.
[39:16.89]I am the fattest piggy bank in the world, but I will not break for you.
[39:20.54]You cannot quench your thirst here in the lonely dark.
[39:23.44]Who could?
[39:25.34]What should appear on the doorstep of my web but a nice juicy fly?
[39:54.45]Let's get every last drop out of him.
[39:56.09]Alright, let's go.
[39:58.99]Quick, get out before the cops come!
[40:03.63]Huh?
[40:06.63]Why did I punch him?
[40:07.57]I don't know.
[40:07.97]If I bite somebody, I gotta keep him quiet.
[40:18.53]Isn't that how it works?
[40:22.86]Oh, shit.
[40:23.82]Okay, that- Can I- how do I talk?
[40:28.98]Uh, is that- is the thing on the bottom talk or is the thing on the bottom like smirk because I'm going to bite you?
[40:37.47]How do I talk?
[40:38.09]Okay.
[40:42.77]What strings pull you, stranger?
[40:45.27]F this talk.
[40:46.15]No, it's not.
[40:46.51]This guy's terrified.
[40:47.55]Okay.
[40:47.85]Could I persuade you to provide me with funds recently pilfered from me?
[40:51.75]I'm gonna try to steal money.
[41:13.33]Give me some money.
[41:14.11]God, why do I have to be like a fucking moron?
[41:23.59]Perhaps we might take a street-side rendezvous.
[41:27.56]Luck is a limpid leper.
[41:29.14]Farewell.
[41:29.60]No, we're not going to fucking destroy the game at the very... What is save game?
[41:35.74]It's like save game.
[41:37.72]Here.
[41:38.42]Okay, there's an auto-save at least.
[41:39.77]That's good.
[41:44.99]What about you?
[41:47.40]I'll scream.
[41:49.78]There's no talk.
[41:50.44]Okay, well.
[41:54.18]Don't do any, like, magical powers.
[41:55.64]This is a cup.
[42:00.37]Put the blood on the ground.
[42:01.07]Alright, let's see.
[42:02.15]Somebody came in here.
[42:02.81]Okay, I'm gonna follow this blood trail.
[42:13.93]Who is this guy?
[42:17.92]Is this like a... Just a... Are you fleet... Are you the fleet-footed god?
[42:22.66]You need only open your eyes.
[42:25.37]Now tell me your tale.
[42:45.41]What is this lump?
[42:46.97]Is this my rib?
[42:48.31]Holy shit, my rib is broken through my side?
[42:51.69]I'm all numb.
[42:52.93]You gotta look and tell me.
[42:54.89]Reveal your clubs and assassins or I will finish the task.
[42:58.61]Hippocrates is not my... Hippocrates is not my forefather.
[43:01.42]Who broke you, Mercury?
[43:02.96]You are a silly dying man.
[43:04.68]You are a silly dying man.
[43:07.76]I'm lying here bleeding to death and you're cracking wise?
[43:10.72]I don't need this crap.
[43:12.59]Who made you a flesh cry?
[43:14.65]Who made you a flesh cry?
[43:16.37]Mm-hmm.
[43:36.41]Mm-hmm.
[43:36.67]I'm gonna fucking rip them all apart.
[43:37.83]So this guy's supposed to be, like, from New York?
[43:38.97]So everybody's a vampire.
[43:40.17]Yeah.
[44:00.87]So you have the boom boom.
[44:02.39]Where are the demons who attacked you?
[44:04.29]You're a mouse playing among giants.
[44:05.97]The price shall know.
[44:08.11]Of what blood do you... Where are the demons who attacked you?
[44:10.37]Okay.
[44:10.59]Mercury's not so fleet, so must I be in his stead?
[44:11.77]Tell me where my feet must travel.
[44:30.44]Down the street in the parking garage, downstairs to the beach on the right.
[44:44.35]Okay.
[44:45.47]I must become like the wayward whale and hit the beach.
[44:48.03]So I gotta go to the beach.
[44:51.75]Down the street in the parking garage, downstairs to the beach on the right.
[44:55.31]In a world of GPS, we're going back to an age where you had to remember things.
[44:59.05]Remember this.
[45:00.99]Down the street, parking garage, downstairs to the beach on the right.
[45:03.99]Okay.
[45:04.13]So I'm going to go annihilate these guys.
[45:05.91]The moon shows the path that is best taken.
[45:08.13]Farewell.
[45:23.91]Map isn't that big?
[45:25.35]Okay.
[45:25.55]I'll turn it up a little more.
[45:26.73]I can't tell anybody about the deal.
[45:27.99]Hmm.
[45:28.15]Can I do something to stop your flesh from screaming?
[45:48.55]I think I have pain pills, don't I?
[45:54.54]I shall return with some numbness.
[45:57.94]I have some, don't I?
[46:03.55]Pill bottle.
[46:04.11]Estrogen.
[46:05.11]Caution.
[46:05.47]Do not take if male.
[46:06.93]Wait, what?
[46:08.57]Should I give it to him?
[46:11.61]Hey, this might help.
[46:13.70]Blood pack.
[46:14.38]I don't have anything.
[46:18.91]I have $100.
[46:19.07]I have $100 and I have estrogen.
[46:21.19]Alright, well, I'll quest update.
[46:25.39]Is there a map?
[46:30.56]What happens if I drink that?
[46:34.58]Let's try it.
[46:37.02]Wait, why do I even have it?
[46:38.26]I have no idea.
[46:43.20]Urban areas have maps.
[46:44.26]Okay, so down the street.
[46:47.03]Pass like the naked lady.
[46:49.88]We just walk... Okay, we just walk around like this?
[46:54.45]That's not... Oh, that... Is that one of the... Is that a... Oh, no.
[46:56.93]Okay.
[46:57.41]Alright, down the street.
[46:58.29]Parking garage.
[47:03.93]Beach access.
[47:05.94]Alright, I'm ready to fucking obfuscate.
[47:09.46]I've seen a lot of shocking things in my time on the force, but that pier, that's the kind of thing that makes you lose your faith
[47:16.30]Okay, downstairs.
[47:17.10]Advert your eyes.
[47:20.58]So, is there, like, a pounce?
[47:31.98]I'm gonna obfuscate.
[47:35.76]Don't worry, guys.
[47:36.36]I'm gonna, like, ovulate down there and, like, hide.
[47:39.88]On the right.
[47:40.40]Okay, is this it?
[47:40.98]Up there.
[47:42.24]Through that chain link gate and up those stairs.
[47:46.34]Ah, the demons who broke the fleet-footed guard.
[47:50.48]You see the twisted strings of my tomorrow speak no more.
[47:56.30]May the moon light your twisted path, shadow sea of farewell.
[48:05.25]These are the guys.
[48:05.79]Alright, time.
[48:07.05]Here we go.
[48:10.98]What?
[48:11.94]Level 1 Obsc... What am I, a fucking night elf?
[48:16.79]Oh my god, I can't... Stop doing it!
[48:20.11]Turn it off!
[48:22.45]Turn it off!
[48:24.25]Turn it off!
[48:25.45]How do I turn it off?
[48:34.43]Don't look over here!
[48:35.31]Alright, how do I turn off my World of Warcraft racial ability?
[48:41.71]Should have done the tutorial.
[48:44.09]Look, everyone screamed at me because I was gonna do the tutorial.
[48:47.95]And now everyone's screaming at me because I didn't do the tutorial.
[48:52.41]You can't have your cake and eat it too.
[48:54.39]You can have a piece of cake and then you eat the cake slowly.
[49:02.58]How do I turn it off?
[49:12.50]Didn't I play this years ago?
[49:13.78]No, I didn't.
[49:18.09]Oh, my fucking god.
[49:19.29]It's right-click, but how do I, like, stop... How do I stop it from being on?
[49:23.15]There's gotta be, like, a... Turn it off, right?
[49:35.85]Once I get that, everything else I already know what I'm doing.
[49:40.24]What's like to stop the spell from being on?
[49:45.05]Toggle view.
[49:47.21]Feed.
[49:47.95]Use.
[49:48.73]Inventory.
[49:49.25]Range weapons.
[49:53.41]Previous.
[49:53.95]End discipline.
[49:55.11]F8.
[49:55.19]Oh my.
[49:57.35]F8.
[49:58.02]Of all the fucking things to have.
[49:59.24]F8?
[49:59.80]No, we're gonna change that.
[50:12.10]What am I going to change this to?
[50:13.10]Like... N or something?
[50:17.37]Is anything bound to N?
[50:23.99]No.
[50:24.27]We're going to do like... N. For no.
[50:29.43]Okay.
[50:31.54]There.
[50:31.80]That... Now... Okay.
[50:34.82]Now that's good.
[50:35.78]That's great.
[50:39.74]So it's these guys...
[50:46.97]Let's turn the music on.
[50:47.99]I can talk to these guys, or I can just drink their blood.
[50:54.99]Although, I don't know if I want to do that.
[50:59.38]I'm going to reload the save.
[51:03.68]This is from here, right?
[51:07.76]Why don't I pay attention?
[51:08.90]Pay attention to what?
[51:11.46]I skipped the long tutorial to do the basic bare bones information.
[51:17.46]I was never told what F8... I don't know what the fuck that does.
[51:20.94]Okay, let's go.
[51:21.46]So, can I, like, go through this?
[51:22.40]Alright, so these guys are good guys.
[51:48.67]No, no, I'm stuck.
[51:49.75]We got out of the way.
[51:56.25]Is there a walk?
[51:57.49]Yeah, there is.
[51:57.87]Okay, this is where I gotta be careful.
[52:09.28]This is where the bad guys are.
[52:12.54]And the Scooby Doo.
[52:15.86]Did these guys get a bat?
[52:19.93]Okay.
[52:21.07]Eat him.
[52:23.03]Bloodbath!
[52:27.87]I don't think I'm hurting these guys.
[52:29.57]There we go.
[52:30.27]That guy's done.
[52:35.08]Give me the bat.
[52:35.52]Give me the bat.
[52:36.00]Give me the bat.
[52:42.00]That guy told you he had a bat?
[52:43.52]Well, didn't the guy tell me to reason with him?
[52:54.11]Alright, hold on.
[52:54.65]I'm gonna use this.
[53:05.65]Wait, when did I say the game sucked?
[53:07.27]What are you guys talking about?
[53:08.58]I didn't do the long tutorial.
[53:13.98]I'm enjoying this.
[53:14.94]What are we on about here?
[53:16.20]What are you guys talking about?
[53:24.57]Alright, well let me let me do this again The bat does less damage Alright, let me I only have fists I don't have any guns with light clothing.
[53:47.54]That's all I have Keyring blood bag watch
[53:56.98]What is the tutorial going to show me that I haven't seen?
[54:01.62]Real question, straight up real question.
[54:04.40]If I do the tutorial, what am I going to learn that I don't know now?
[54:08.44]What is it?
[54:10.85]Tell me!
[54:17.89]How to do what?
[54:21.43]Huh?
[54:24.66]It shows you the controls.
[54:27.12]It'll take 20 minutes for me to figure that out.
[54:30.39]It doesn't do anything.
[54:33.55]Like, this is sneak.
[54:34.51]I understand that.
[54:38.27]You get a skill point for doing the tutorial.
[54:39.79]Well, nobody told me that.
[54:43.00]Up there.
[54:44.28]Through that chain link gate and up those stairs.
[54:48.66]Yeah, let's go.
[54:49.74]Those men... Never mind.
[54:52.68]You wouldn't understand.
[54:55.79]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[54:56.37]Alright, let's do it.
[54:59.13]This time I'm going to sneak around the house.
[55:09.23]Okay.
[55:10.03]Game saved right here.
[55:17.24]Does this guy eventually go in the house?
[55:19.20]He might.
[55:20.94]Let's find out.
[55:24.97]I can talk to the guy in the front.
[55:26.17]How come when I walked up before he was like... He attacked me.
[55:29.67]Isn't that what I just did last time?
[55:35.07]Like, that's what I thought.
[55:35.65]I was like, oh, I'll try to reason with them.
[55:37.35]I literally walked up to the guy and he started attacking me.
[55:44.08]So I can talk to this guy, right?
[55:46.14]Speak to this guy.
[55:50.56]Help ya?
[55:53.91]Because I was using magic?
[55:58.15]Okay.
[55:58.65]Well, that was weird.
[55:59.73]Alright.
[56:00.23]Step aside, gatekeeper.
[56:01.33]I'm here to see the astral lights.
[56:02.69]I wonder what your brains look like in this light.
[56:05.55]I'm here to see the astral lights.
[56:06.65]Oh my god.
[56:07.56]Oh my god.
[56:08.24]Hold on a second.
[56:09.22]Uh...
[56:22.44]Jake just gave more than $200 plus right now.
[56:31.89]Holy shit.
[56:35.12]Wow.
[56:37.74]Jake, thank you so much.
[56:41.64]I don't know what to say.
[56:44.83]A, man, it's me again.
[56:45.87]Just thought I'd give everything I've been wanting to since I found you on YouTube.
[56:50.25]Again, keep streaming.
[56:51.07]You're the only reason I'm even here.
[56:54.85]Holy shit.
[56:56.98]Well, Jake, that's... That's way more money than I could ever imagine somebody would ever give me in one sitting.
[57:03.44]And, like, some of you guys have done it.
[57:05.90]It's un-fucking-real to me.
[57:07.88]Like, it's unbelievable.
[57:09.34]So, thank you so much, dude.
[57:11.44]I'm glad you're around.
[57:14.16]Never feel obligated to pay me money.
[57:16.36]But I appreciate it nonetheless.
[57:18.08]Thank you.
[57:22.08]Red text is your trait only.
[57:28.34]Okay, cool.
[57:31.39]Kind of looks like me.
[57:34.07]Option one.
[57:34.57]I could just tell him to get out of the way.
[57:35.79]Alright, I'm going to tell him to get away.
[57:40.61]Step aside, gatekeeper.
[57:47.89]So I just, like, got in his mind.
[57:49.88]Alright, that's cool.
[57:52.44]Your words echo in the vast emptiness of my head.
[57:54.38]Farewell.
[57:57.12]Shit will not be started.
[58:00.98]Okay.
[58:02.54]So, I was allowed in here.
[58:07.05]I just, like, Jedi mind tricked him.
[58:14.21]For a bunch of, like, psychos, you've got some interesting towels.
[58:17.83]It's like baby clothes and, like, a baby towel.
[58:25.63]So, am I gonna get... Am I allowed in here?
[58:31.15]Um...
[58:49.62]Oh wait, he can't...
[58:50.28]What?!
[58:52.22]You let me in!
[58:53.36]This is your own fault!
[58:54.24]Alright, I got the baseball bat.
[59:00.70]I got a gun too.
[59:07.04]Do I have to be in first person for the gun?
[59:10.00]Yeah, I do.
[59:17.88]Anybody left?
[59:22.35]These guys apparently are playing cards.
[59:30.77]Is it one shot, one kill?
[59:33.49]What?!
[59:35.25]What?!
[59:35.99]Oh god, it's not!
[59:48.96]Come here!
[59:51.47]Drain him!
[59:52.33]Drain his entire life force!
[59:53.69]Kill him!
[59:54.19]Suck his- Suck him dry!
[60:00.97]Tire- Okay, I got a tire iron.
[60:03.57]I have no gun skill.
[60:04.57]Okay, put it away then.
[60:06.41]Give me that- Okay, melee combat 4.
[60:09.75]3.
[60:10.97]Damage potential 12.
[60:11.84]I think I should probably put this on because I don't have any requirement.
[60:15.34]I have like- My fists are worse.
[60:22.71]Alright, I don't want to go too crazy here.
[60:24.41]Because that would be bad.
[60:27.71]Alright, where's the guy's stuff?
[60:32.47]Oh, hi.
[60:36.05]What just exploded?
[60:37.94]What exploded?
[60:43.64]You just dropped me through the wall.
[60:44.98]That's not fair.
[60:49.94]Look, I gave him the ring around the Rosie.
[60:55.83]Shit!
[60:56.15]Okay, we're gonna do it again, we're gonna do it again.
[60:58.47]He's not gonna see me coming around this way.
[61:05.24]Oh, goddammit, he actually got, like, smarts.
[61:07.12]How many bullets does your gun have?
[61:15.14]Alright, we're at 38.
[61:16.82]And here is the guy's car stereo.
[61:20.04]I don't have any points in stealth.
[61:26.43]That's okay.
[61:27.19]Alright, so where's the stuff that I need to get for this guy?
[61:32.27]What?
[61:32.71]What the fuck?
[61:35.57]There were more people in this house?
[61:44.39]I just horror movie trailered this guy.
[61:49.47]That guy just got horror movie trailered.
[61:51.17]I'm happy.
[61:51.53]I'm going to shoot this dude.
[62:00.82]It's probably like a quick inventory I can do, right?
[62:03.86]No, I'm not.
[62:04.64]Why would I even use this knife?
[62:06.44]I'm going to put it on the knife.
[62:19.28]Oh, fuck you.
[62:20.65]It's not like cooking your meth in here.
[62:22.17]Whatever the hell you're doing.
[62:25.35]Where did he go?
[62:27.15]Where did he go?
[62:27.75]What?
[62:28.41]Where is he?
[62:29.15]Did I just... I think he's wedged inside the wall.
[62:34.10]I think he broke the door.
[62:35.34]Alright, well there's the item that I needed, right?
[62:41.14]Yeah, he's stuck in the door.
[62:46.10]He became the door.
[62:48.45]Well, I got what I wanted.
[62:51.68]Anything else in here?
[62:52.30]I don't think so.
[62:59.06]Alright, bye.
[63:03.10]Wait, can I... It looked like I could just open it.
[63:07.26]Can I open this, like, prop hunt person?
[63:08.90]You just saw the green, right?
[63:12.35]See?
[63:16.15]I found you.
[63:17.55]I'm playing fucking Gary's mod right now.
[63:23.45]Keeps giving me the option to do it.
[63:29.84]No.
[63:30.48]Oh, well.
[63:31.06]Uh, what's that?
[63:31.46]Isn't there money in here, too?
[63:41.03]No, there he is.
[63:41.77]Okay.
[63:41.95]Okay.
[63:45.39]Alright, I turned this guy into a fucking tornado.
[63:49.15]He's having a little bit of trouble.
[63:50.73]I think I just put this guy in the washing machine the wrong way.
[63:57.29]I wonder when he's going to get off the ride.
[64:00.89]Soon enough.
[64:02.61]Nope, now he's just... Alright, that's fine.
[64:13.61]Look, I ended his misery.
[64:14.93]That's all you can say.
[64:19.72]Yeah, we got him on a spin cycle.
[64:24.08]That was fucking awesome.
[64:26.18]What's this?
[64:27.53]Money envelope, $250.
[64:28.27]That sounds good.
[64:33.75]Did I get the community patch?
[64:34.79]Yeah.
[64:35.49]I have the basic community patch.
[64:40.87]Alright, let's head back.
[64:42.17]Do I need to, like, holster?
[64:43.37]Or are people gonna get, like, mad at me, right?
[64:45.76]Oh, that was cool.
[64:49.46]Alright!
[64:52.60]I think we can head back.
[64:53.88]Wait, what about the van?
[64:54.54]Anything in the van?
[64:59.20]Holster this.
[65:02.66]Alright, the people down here, I have plenty of blood.
[65:04.68]This is a dangerous place to have all this.
[65:07.74]I feel like I'm gonna fall off of here.
[65:12.35]Get some clothes.
[65:12.85]Yeah, I can buy clothes.
[65:14.43]Right?
[65:15.31]Who's the clothes merchant?
[65:19.26]There's got to be a clothes store around here, right?
[65:21.48]What's the nearest Macy's?
[65:23.00]Oh.
[65:25.20]Alright, we made it.
[65:29.15]So, now do you have something to tell me now?
[65:30.83]I'm going to China.
[65:34.09]Why am I going to China?
[65:43.31]You don't make any sense.
[65:46.41]Anything else?
[65:49.37]Evening.
[65:50.73]Why are your words shaped so strangely?
[65:52.39]You sound like a... ...philiac lawnmower.
[65:56.33]I'm no longer here.
[65:58.41]I'm no longer here.
[66:00.21]Listen, it's like I've told you about a thousand times.
[66:03.55]Everybody's so strange.
[66:04.39]We can't hunt around here, alright?
[66:06.69]We're minding our own business.
[66:08.31]No reason to hassle the weaklings.
[66:11.25]I will cast no shadow on your flame, little sickling.
[66:14.07]Let us trade words here under the moribund moon.
[66:18.26]You sound like a lawn mower.
[66:19.68]Okay.
[66:32.17]Uh, why do wolves run?
[66:33.87]He does look like a Disney character.
[66:36.35]Thin bloods.
[66:38.17]Whose clan blood is it that runs in your veins?
[66:41.17]Clan?
[66:56.25]He looks like me.
[66:57.07]Yeah, he kinda does.
[66:58.25]He looks like if I got a caricature done of me.
[66:59.71]Hey, this isn't China.
[67:00.58]Where am I?
[67:15.14]I'd just come to town for the surf tourney.
[67:17.28]Seems like years ago.
[67:18.48]It's been about six months now.
[67:21.28]He's got your eyes.
[67:22.18]I used to hit the local diner after the beach parties fizzled out in the AM.
[67:27.14]That's where I met her.
[67:29.56]Ah, okay.
[67:30.10]The flower girl.
[67:32.18]Not like all the plastic dolls littering the sand.
[67:35.10]Her name was Lily.
[67:36.34]I remember introducing myself.
[67:37.94]The way she seemed grateful for the company.
[67:40.52]A few nights after our meeting, we were on the beach alone.
[67:43.52]Should I just drink this guy?
[67:48.10]Ocean is inviting.
[67:51.24]Uh, what is the quicksave?
[67:53.59]It's more like F something.
[67:56.05]You can swim, right?
[68:00.07]I guess you can't swim in here.
[68:02.57]Alright, let's keep going.
[68:03.35]Uh, no.
[68:05.13]Ooh, what's this?
[68:15.72]Wooden stake.
[68:18.56]So this is like an instant kill for vampires.
[68:20.18]Let me just look what's up here.
[68:21.03]This is one of those collection games where you collect all the items and you combine on the crafting bench.
[68:30.27]I'm gonna get lost.
[68:35.52]Watch this.
[68:35.84]I'm gonna go up here and I'm not gonna know where I am.
[68:38.42]But that's the beauty of getting lost in games like this.
[68:40.98]It's fun.
[68:44.97]This is where the pier is closed off.
[68:53.45]Quest log updated.
[68:57.79]Wait, don't open that.
[68:59.87]I've been trying to open this.
[69:03.13]Quest log.
[69:04.46]It's got to be one of these, right?
[69:06.50]No?
[69:07.18]Okay, hotkeys.
[69:09.94]That's actually pretty useful.
[69:12.74]Quest log!
[69:14.97]Alright, my masquerade is I'm fine over there.
[69:17.17]Humanity quest log, okay.
[69:19.31]You saw the murder scene on the pier, but weren't able to find out anything significant about the killer, except that the killing was extremely brutal, vicious, and beast-like.
[69:26.73]Mercurio is in need of some serious painkillers.
[69:29.43]You retrieved the Astralite from Mercurio.
[69:31.29]You should return to him and find out what your next step should be.
[69:34.57]Alright, let's just go back there.
[69:40.28]Hysteria.
[69:43.89]Arcade machines.
[69:44.51]Do any of these work?
[69:47.04]13.
[69:47.80]13 soda?
[69:49.34]Ow, my wrist.
[69:50.28]I just broke my arm in half.
[69:53.50]Liquid demon seed.
[69:54.60]I'm not so sure I would want to drink that.
[69:57.76]I feel like that would not be something I would want to put in my mouth.
[70:04.46]What?
[70:04.58]Did something come out?
[70:09.66]Can any of these be played?
[70:12.43]One of these has to be playable, right?
[70:13.91]Just like every other weird video game like this.
[70:15.75]One cabinet works.
[70:18.29]Oh well.
[70:22.99]Holster.
[70:26.00]Uh, who are you?
[70:26.54]This is just a random police officer.
[70:28.56]You're gonna have to move along now.
[70:33.46]Nobody can see me, right?
[70:34.88]Move along.
[70:36.64]Nothing to see here.
[70:37.52]Wait, no no no.
[70:38.14]Don't drink the police officer's blood.
[70:40.98]That would be bad because he's a police officer and he's going to go tell the other police officers.
[70:45.55]Don't do that.
[70:53.87]Cod 2 Arcade.
[70:57.35]Let's just go back.
[70:58.53]Continue the quest.
[71:08.19]Is this just Grand Theft Auto Vampire?
[71:11.03]Not really.
[71:12.68]It's more like an RPG than anything else.
[71:20.72]I'm going to put points into sneaking around, right?
[71:26.31]I probably should, shouldn't I?
[71:30.19]Either that or I'm going to put it into... I don't know.
[71:36.09]GTA Evanescence?
[71:40.43]Uh, Scooby-Doo-mobile.
[71:44.33]What is this?
[71:44.85]You're not strong enough to move this.
[71:46.25]I can, like, break these bars with my bare hands.
[71:48.07]That'd be fucking crazy.
[71:53.54]Uh, what about you?
[71:59.12]Yeah.
[72:00.00]How much will my purse be lightened?
[72:01.68]Should I do this?
[72:04.21]$50?
[72:04.23]$50?
[72:04.27]I only have... That's like 20% of my total money.
[72:08.21]That's too much money for me right now.
[72:10.39]I don't know if I can afford it.
[72:11.41]I'm not gonna do it!
[72:12.01]Alright, here.
[72:12.65]I got your bag of... ...drugs.
[72:34.07]Here you go.
[72:34.59]Is he dead?
[72:39.97]Fuck, he's dead.
[72:40.59]No, he's not.
[72:43.99]Okay.
[72:44.83]Have you crossed the Dark River, Mercury?
[72:48.68]I got the boom-boom.
[72:49.64]I sent them to the other side.
[72:52.48]Oh, shit.
[73:05.19]Do I give his money back?
[73:09.32]Should I just keep the money?
[73:13.96]Did I give one XP?
[73:16.44]Gave him the money?
[73:18.13]It was 250 bucks.
[73:20.47]I gave it to him.
[73:30.01]I might have to buy some new kidneys with this Alright, so Where do I go now to make some place disappear a warehouse?
[73:39.48]Looks to be a sabbat interest
[73:42.92]Give money, take blood.
[73:43.94]Yeah, he's giving me a down payment for the word.
[73:46.18]I'm about to drink.
[73:46.88]Alright, I gotta blow up a warehouse.
[73:50.58]Who tells me where is the house of where's?
[73:52.30]Tell me of the house of where's.
[73:53.90]I can't fit Sabbath into my cerebrum.
[73:57.36]Alright, where is it?
[73:59.86]Okay.
[74:00.02]Okay.
[74:13.87]Yes, fleet-footed one.
[74:14.96]So he's crazy.
[74:15.74]Okay, good.
[74:16.34]Mm-hmm.
[74:30.40]Are there other voices for me to hear?
[74:32.12]Tongue, I hear this within my head.
[74:33.72]The worm hides in turban.
[74:35.18]Alright, anybody else?
[74:36.18]Nope.
[74:36.44]Okay, where is she?
[75:00.07]She and her sister, Jeanette, they run the asylum.
[75:02.79]Some freaky customers frequent that place.
[75:04.93]I try not to do business there.
[75:06.19]Who exactly?
[75:07.58]She's the woman around here.
[75:09.58]Power player.
[75:09.90]Nice looking broad for a dead chick, but personality like stone.
[75:27.58]I need you to paint me another picture of the other one.
[75:30.26]Therese, I don't like, but I can respect her.
[75:33.86]Jeanette's different.
[75:35.20]I don't know what to make of her.
[75:36.72]She's a little, you know, in the head.
[75:39.64]I don't know.
[75:40.06]Well, you didn't tell me what she looks like.
[75:41.29]Well, like you.
[75:42.65]And I would think so is Jeanette.
[75:44.39]But I hear rumors about her.
[75:47.49]Alright.
[75:48.35]Alright.
[75:49.03]Jeanette got her body built for bedrooms.
[75:52.17]And I got close acquaintances that says they conquered that territory.
[75:56.34]Yeah, I like how they pepper nonsense.
[76:02.97]Alright.
[76:05.03]I cannot hear you because I'm not here.
[76:11.43]So, let's take a look.
[76:14.41]Mercurio has told you about a warehouse being used by the Sabbath that must be infiltrated and destroyed.
[76:20.02]The problem is that Bertram Tongue, the only person who might be able to get you in, is hiding...
[76:24.83]Because of a feud with Teresa Vorman, the owner of the asylum.
[76:28.05]To get to Tongue, you'll have to find some way to call off the feud.
[76:30.47]Okay.
[76:33.99]So, I have to go find Teresa.
[76:38.10]So, where, um... Specifically?
[76:41.84]Tell me more of, uh... I need some boomsticks?
[76:44.58]Once I stop leaking my guts out, I'll be back on the beam.
[76:46.82]I can get some specialty stuff, but it's gonna take some time.
[76:50.90]If you can keep quiet about the Astralite deal, I'd be willing to supply you.
[76:54.79]Alright, so... Here.
[76:58.81]Tell me the pieces of the lady's board.
[77:01.16]Tell me the boom... Alright, tell me the pieces of the lady's board.
[77:04.10]God damn it.
[77:06.84]The worm in his black bath.
[77:08.48]Alright, we have to go to the asylum.
[77:12.20]So, I left before my mouth stopped moving.
[77:13.71]Alright, let's go.
[77:15.13]We have to go to the asylum.
[77:16.09]Where the hell that is?
[77:25.20]Can I use the phone?
[77:26.00]No.
[77:35.41]I'll fit right in.
[77:36.17]Alright, well, here's a hospital.
[77:47.03]Can I heal him now?
[77:50.05]Oh, shit.
[77:50.49]Hold on.
[77:55.83]Is this like a regular person hospital?
[78:01.35]I feel like I shouldn't be in here.
[78:02.71]Do we have to go to like a vampire specific hospital?
[78:05.79]You'll be seeing me be on site.
[78:06.95]What?
[78:07.31]It worked.
[78:21.98]Okay, thank you.
[78:24.22]Thank you for letting me in.
[78:27.79]Oh, God.
[78:30.41]No.
[78:31.57]The broken will be mended.
[78:32.71]Did I just breathe?
[78:41.84]What did I just smell?
[78:43.66]I'll be back for you.
[78:45.88]Give her blood.
[78:46.50]Okay, blood.
[78:47.92]Hold on.
[78:49.69]This doctor-patient confidentiality.
[78:52.83]Can someone call my grandma, please?
[78:55.99]Don't you go before I rescue you.
[78:58.21]How do I do it?
[78:58.71]I'm going to open up my inventory and I'm going to give.
[79:06.92]It didn't work.
[79:10.22]How do you give somebody an item in this game?
[79:14.92]Give her estrogen.
[79:17.16]Here, take it.
[79:19.92]Talk to the doctor.
[79:21.38]Okay.
[79:26.44]Hey.
[79:27.28]Anyone here have a fatal injury?
[79:29.52]I almost just like started drinking her blood.
[79:32.44]Alright, well, let's keep going.
[79:33.78]There's plenty of rooms to explore.
[79:35.02]Room three.
[79:38.20]Uh, doctor?
[79:38.72]Yes, it's me.
[79:40.06]I'll be in the bathroom.
[79:41.96]Okay.
[79:45.60]I'm sorry, sir, but you're going to have to wait outside like everyone else.
[79:48.34]No exceptions.
[79:49.91]A saintly little morsel is teetering on death's razor edge.
[79:54.49]Are you sure you're in the right place?
[79:56.96]Psychiatrics are on the third floor.
[79:59.14]My vision is as clear as the murk-muddled rainwater.
[80:02.00]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[80:04.30]And to be honest, I don't have time to figure it out.
[80:06.86]I'm the only doctor here right now, and we have twice as many people as usual waiting for treatment.
[80:11.02]But the little angel is sliding further into that great black abyss.
[80:14.27]Listen.
[80:15.17]I think you're telling me about that girl over there, and I hear you.
[80:17.87]But right now, I have a man with a bullet hole in his head, and he needs me more than she does.
[80:22.89]Just stay with her and make sure she doesn't go into shock, and I'll be there soon.
[80:27.71]Okay.
[80:28.17]What time is it?
[80:33.08]Well, your patience... I can only rest for a second.
[80:36.00]Should I just slit this guy's throat so he has to move to the other room?
[80:38.84]Getting no response.
[80:40.32]He's dead, right?
[80:46.26]Okay, so room 2.
[80:47.52]What's in room 2?
[80:50.18]Nothing.
[80:51.20]Whole lot of nothing in room 2.
[80:52.56]That's great.
[80:56.20]Yeah, chaotic.
[80:57.05]Good.
[80:57.45]Yeah, sure.
[80:57.91]That's exactly what we're doing.
[80:58.83]Alright, hold on.
[80:59.35]There's a couple more things to look at here.
[81:01.95]This is locked.
[81:03.87]Administration.
[81:07.97]Computer?
[81:09.33]Hack the world.
[81:09.83]Here we go.
[81:10.69]You have three emails through your email.
[81:15.69]Password?
[81:17.90]Hack.
[81:20.24]Lake?
[81:21.48]The Lakers.
[81:22.62]This guy's a Lakers fan.
[81:26.80]Okay, a little help.
[81:29.26]Hey Danny, I could use a little help down here.
[81:31.06]Can you go up to the controlled substances for some morphine?
[81:33.76]I'm pretty busy right now.
[81:34.84]Thanks.
[81:35.28]F-dog.
[81:35.96]Okay.
[81:38.06]Go up to the controlled substances for morphine.
[81:42.68]Uh, yeah, no, it's not for my personal use, you bastard.
[81:46.38]I didn't know they were out upstairs.
[81:48.22]I didn't know they were out upstairs.
[81:49.40]Maybe you can get some in Malcolm's office.
[81:51.58]By the way, your mother wears combat boots.
[81:53.77]F-dog.
[81:54.41]Okay.
[81:55.37]So I gotta go in his office.
[81:57.05]Oh shit, that's cold, but I'll make sure to knock before I go in.
[81:59.73]I'd hate to catch him in the middle of a pelvic examination.
[82:02.61]And by the way, tell your mom to stop calling me.
[82:04.89]Okay, so it's in this guy's office upstairs.
[82:07.74]Somebody just puked.
[82:10.00]Somebody just fucking puked.
[82:15.29]I heard that.
[82:15.77]Alright, so the painkillers are upstairs.
[82:24.16]Alright, so this is room four.
[82:26.64]What do I want in here?
[82:28.10]Dr. Malcolm.
[82:30.48]Need lockpicks.
[82:31.52]Fuck.
[82:33.78]Ooh.
[82:34.60]Pill bottle.
[82:36.40]Is that it?
[82:39.36]Estrogen.
[82:39.72]More estrogen!
[82:40.55]No!
[82:40.93]Why?
[82:41.95]What's with the estrogen?
[82:46.18]Why am I still shirtless?
[82:47.24]Because this is how the character came.
[82:48.54]This is how the character came out of the box.
[82:52.90]I can't go upstairs yet.
[82:55.19]Whatever.
[82:55.45]Nothing there.
[83:00.43]This is where he is still.
[83:02.77]I swear to God, I... I want to just, like, shoot that guy.
[83:08.14]So, like, he has to come to the other room.
[83:10.82]Oh, wait, hold on.
[83:12.24]Nope, I can't open this one either.
[83:14.18]Shit!
[83:14.36]Shit!
[83:17.59]I can just see through the world right there.
[83:20.76]Alright, everything's gonna be fine.
[83:24.80]Hey.
[83:25.92]You alright?
[83:30.00]I can't talk to her anymore.
[83:33.06]Do I need to stay in here?
[83:34.47]If you think you might die...
[83:49.53]Okay, well.
[83:54.79]I think I'm going to kill this guy.
[83:59.27]I'm going to kill the guy he's working on.
[84:00.65]Can I do it in a way that nobody knows?
[84:02.31]We're getting no response.
[84:07.15]What if I just go invisible and then shoot him?
[84:15.03]Hold on.
[84:17.42]There's people to talk to here.
[84:18.50]No, there's not.
[84:20.20]Okay, I guess I can't do anything.
[84:26.72]Feed the girl your blood.
[84:33.08]Is this guy... I can talk to this guy.
[84:34.72]Why?
[84:35.68]Uh, no.
[84:47.93]Feed her your blood?
[84:50.15]I can actually do that.
[84:52.43]Talk to the girl again.
[84:53.41]I can't talk to her.
[85:06.42]I cannot do this.
[85:08.30]So, can't do it.
[85:10.64]Let's keep going.
[85:13.17]I'm gonna go to the actual, like, main story mission.
[85:27.51]Let's, like, just keep playing the game.
[85:35.40]That's not, like, one of the girls, is it?
[85:36.80]Alright, let me just... We haven't even walked down here yet.
[85:46.06]Nobody, nobody.
[85:46.74]Alright, but it was some alleyway, right?
[85:49.74]It was like, go to the alley.
[85:51.30]Let's see.
[85:54.76]There's a lot of side missions, isn't there?
[85:58.99]Hmm.
[86:00.89]Okay, the warehouse.
[86:02.23]Gotta go to the asylum.
[86:04.71]Needs painkillers.
[86:07.59]Where is... Oh, there's like four towns.
[86:12.37]Holy shit.
[86:19.62]So, where was I supposed to meet that... Where was I supposed to meet John DiMaggio?
[86:28.42]No.
[86:32.32]Okay, this is like an alley.
[86:35.34]Didn't you say it was like down here?
[86:38.11]No.
[86:41.25]No, we don't need sub-only mode.
[86:42.77]It's not necessary.
[86:46.23]Can I go in this building?
[86:48.91]No.
[86:52.15]Um, what about down here?
[86:58.12]This is a, ah, look at this.
[86:59.62]The asylum.
[87:00.48]Hmm.
[87:03.59]Blood bank.
[87:09.61]Alright.
[87:09.81]Well, let's take a look.
[87:10.77]Blood bank is downstairs.
[87:12.03]What's upstairs?
[87:16.90]A locked door.
[87:22.49]So, blood bank, I can buy and sell blood.
[87:28.28]Mm-hmm.
[87:31.84]Wait, is this part of the hospital?
[87:35.18]Hello.
[87:35.32]Oh, I can give blood.
[87:36.06]Uh... Your tongue makes strange gobbled noises.
[87:38.38]Does the Pope wear a funny hat?
[88:00.42]There's a pair of shit in the woods?
[88:02.16]Uh, your eyes see much.
[88:03.18]How much for a liquid lunch?
[88:04.58]Show me your crimson nectars.
[88:05.84]Okay.
[88:06.02]94 dollars.
[88:30.95]Wow.
[88:32.07]Blue blood pack.
[88:33.85]A bag of blood from only the finest human specimens drinking it restores blood points.
[88:38.33]$94.
[88:39.59]I only have a hundred bucks.
[88:48.43]I can sell blood too.
[88:50.53]Alright, this is fucking dog shit like capitalism in full effect.
[88:56.47]This is GameStop capitalism in full effect right now, guys.
[89:00.24]So here's, here's Call of Duty, uh, here's Call of Duty fucking Black Ops 3.
[89:06.44]What's the, what's the, no, no, World War II, whatever the new dumb Call of Duty.
[89:09.76]Here's World War II Call of Duty, I just bought it for $100, right?
[89:13.64]GameStop, I walk back in the store five minutes later and it's worth like $8 trading.
[89:18.47]That's horseshit.
[89:22.57]Look at this fucking stupid GameStop capitalism here.
[89:29.71]Uh, sell keys?
[89:30.99]Can I sell him money?
[89:31.87]Alright, what about a watch?
[89:37.45]A replica of a much nicer watch.
[89:40.67]Can sell him a car stereo.
[89:45.39]Well, I can sell him this shit.
[89:46.21]Do you want, like, a tire iron?
[89:50.51]What use would a hospital have for this shit?
[89:54.05]Uh, how about a baseball bat?
[90:06.68]Alright.
[90:07.58]Um... Sell him a fake watch.
[90:11.78]I'm gonna sell him a car stereo.
[90:16.32]Can I sell him my hands?
[90:17.56]No, I can't sell them.
[90:20.56]What about the estrogen?
[90:21.60]No.
[90:24.36]Wooden stake, I'm gonna keep that.
[90:25.56]Hey, do you want like a picture of my chest?
[90:31.44]What about the gun?
[90:32.30]I'm not gonna use this gun.
[90:33.30]How much is it?
[90:33.92]Eight bucks here.
[90:34.64]Take a gun.
[90:38.45]Alright, that's good.
[90:39.65]I just made $68.
[90:40.25]What else can I do here?
[90:43.89]Uh, no.
[90:44.41]What happens if I just walk through?
[90:51.39]No, I need to get lockpicking.
[90:55.79]$8 for a .38 revolver.
[90:56.85]Yeah, we're living in weird times.
[91:12.17]That gun was worth less than a fake watch.
[91:14.23]Alright, here's the asylum.
[91:17.69]We need to find Teresa.
[91:20.83]Wherever she is.
[91:21.61]There's also this sketchy... Where's this going?
[91:31.74]Tripp's Pawn Shop.
[91:34.72]Tattoo.
[91:36.10]Let's go to the pawn shop.
[91:43.67]That's an interesting place to put that.
[91:47.05]Got TVs, they got lamps.
[91:50.90]What do we got?
[91:53.74]Hey, what?
[91:55.18]How's it going?
[91:55.74]Looking to buy or sell?
[91:57.46]I have goods in need for your gold.
[92:01.81]What is your true name, Death Dealer?
[92:03.41]Do you sell boomsticks?
[92:04.51]How much gold for your goods?
[92:05.97]Yeah, let's see.
[92:07.51]Okay, he has a lockpick.
[92:10.45]Computers for Grandma.
[92:13.73]So I can learn computers.
[92:15.67]Well, I definitely need a lockpick.
[92:19.20]I have to have one.
[92:20.68]Should I get computers for grandma?
[92:29.02]I don't think I can do anything else with this.
[92:31.42]I can sell him estrogen, but who cares?
[92:33.10]85.
[92:37.20]Is a lockpick multi-use?
[92:44.11]Thanks for coming back.
[92:45.51]What you need?
[92:46.11]Alright, can you tell me the lady?
[92:49.63]Beats me.
[92:50.75]Santa Monica is dead.
[92:52.01]I don't know why anyone comes out here anymore.
[92:56.31]Do you fear the shadow-cloaked killer?
[92:58.17]How much gold for your goods?
[93:01.83]Yet more death while the shadow-cloaked killer runs free.
[93:05.99]It's freaking me out, to be honest.
[93:08.13]I'm hoping all night in Santa Monica police don't rank amongst the nation's most worst.
[93:12.81]Alright, be safe dealer of death.
[93:15.59]Alright, here's what we got today.
[93:18.01]I've got a lockpick now Gameplay takes place in LA Yeah takes place in a strange version of LA or maybe not a strange version of LA.
[93:33.26]Is this the more normal version of LA?
[93:36.16]might be
[93:42.01]Let's go to the asylum.
[93:42.97]Let's actually walk in the door.
[93:44.17]Oh, should I pick a lock?
[93:45.25]Hey, baby.
[93:46.49]Need company?
[93:47.51]No.
[93:55.28]Uh... Let's see.
[94:00.04]Where?
[94:00.42]The asylum.
[94:02.48]Is the asylum, like, a series of random places?
[94:06.21]This is just over here.
[94:11.49]Uh, mosquito lounge.
[94:13.37]Megahertz computing.
[94:22.78]So, that's the asylum.
[94:24.30]Oh, God.
[94:24.82]Foxy... Foxy boxes?
[94:29.41]What's a keypad mean?
[94:36.41]Okay, here it is.
[94:40.16]Let's do some, let's do some investigating.
[94:42.74]Brides.
[94:46.23]Alright.
[94:50.59]Teresa.
[95:04.12]Here we go.
[95:04.46]This is Harley Quinn.
[95:05.56]I see before me a beauty who shares the madness of my mind.
[95:08.82]This guy's dancing in the background.
[95:11.76]Like background dancers.
[95:31.33]And like a really, really good choreographed Beyonce video.
[95:37.05]Greetings, daughter of Janice.
[95:39.58]Oh, but you've got it bad, little boy.
[95:41.88]Not sure exactly what is real and what isn't.
[95:44.64]Remember the single ladies video?
[95:46.06]That's like what they're all doing.
[95:48.07]Isn't that a two-faced Roman god?
[95:50.49]Of course, you're right.
[95:51.91]You just happen to meet the prettier face first.
[95:55.40]You are the whiteness, she of alabaster and ivory.
[95:59.72]Wait until Therese hears that.
[96:01.74]I am white to her black.
[96:03.83]She'll be absolutely furious.
[96:06.29]Of course, I won't be wearing white to any weddings, but we can talk about that later.
[96:12.29]Okay, tell me your name, daughter of Janice.
[96:15.54]Only with the smell of many suitors, I have no interest in your hormones, pheromones.
[96:20.54]Okay, tell me about yourself.
[96:21.30]Can I go play the guitar?
[96:22.72]Okay.
[96:22.90]Jeanette.
[96:23.74]Jeanette.
[96:39.25]And this bit of chaos crammed in a certifiable giggle is my club.
[96:44.21]I just love to give you funny feelings all night, sweetheart, but I really must trouble with some business.
[96:49.30]We'll reunite Sweden soon, I promise.
[96:53.08]Okay.
[96:55.44]See you later.
[96:57.70]What am I doing?
[96:58.22]Oh, I'm watching her go over here.
[97:00.00]Going up the stairs.
[97:10.47]Holy shit, look at this.
[97:11.41]It's like the Goblin from the Hobbit movies.
[97:13.19]The Goblin King.
[97:14.95]Uh, yes.
[97:20.10]Okay, the sisters spawned of the two-headed god.
[97:30.63]This music is driving me nuts.
[97:38.61]I love how I'm just speaking absolutely crazy talk.
[97:43.77]Teresa waits in the arms of her own shadow.
[97:46.28]No, he's giving me, like, permission.
[97:48.48]Alright, I just crazy talked my way up the stairs.
[97:50.26]Alright, first of all, this is important.
[97:51.38]How do you dance?
[98:06.29]Alright, well we found the game.
[98:07.41]Come on, dance with me somebody, please!
[98:12.68]Am I clearing the dance floor because nobody wants to be here with me?
[98:22.01]I gotta get like in the middle here.
[98:23.45]There it is.
[98:24.67]Nice!
[98:30.34]Sucks, bro.
[98:31.12]Oh, the hell kind of music is this?
[98:33.22]This guy knows.
[98:38.32]I was trying to go invisible.
[98:43.58]Come on, bring everybody on.
[98:44.54]It's like a wedding.
[98:46.50]When one guy starts to dance, everybody does the same fucking spaghetti arm.
[98:50.62]Why are we all doing the same thing?
[98:57.12]What?
[98:59.60]What?!
[99:01.92]Everybody- I just made everybody stop dancing.
[99:07.80]Oh look, I dabbed!
[99:08.59]Alright, let's go.
[99:11.45]Let's try to get everybody to dance again.
[99:24.68]Come on, everybody start dancing, come on!
[99:26.66]Let's do it!
[99:33.00]Oh, I can't stop.
[99:34.06]Weapons are not allowed.
[99:34.98]Oh, okay.
[99:37.86]Alright, bye guys.
[99:41.96]So I can go upstairs.
[99:43.02]What does this want me to do?
[99:46.54]The only person who might be able to help you is in hiding because of a feud with Teresa Vorman, the owner of the asylum.
[99:50.37]To get to Tongue, you'll have to find some way to call off the feud.
[99:53.09]I gotta make her call off the feud.
[99:56.73]The men's bathroom is locked.
[100:00.42]She went up.
[100:01.74]I'm going to go up these stairs because I convinced this guy that I'm a nice person.
[100:08.46]Okay.
[100:09.58]Which one?
[100:10.94]Is that Teresa?
[100:13.17]Is the corpse bride Teresa?
[100:14.35]Has to be.
[100:16.21]She's the only other model, the game model.
[100:18.77]Yeah, this has to be her.
[100:20.75]Okay.
[100:28.23]It's not her?
[100:30.31]What?
[100:32.89]This is clearly like could be her.
[100:39.02]It's just a ghost lady.
[100:55.97]I did talk to the bartender.
[100:57.43]He said, go on up, buddy.
[100:58.37]Let's go to... Is the elevator moving?
[101:12.51]What's this?
[101:13.33]Gold ring.
[101:14.47]Oh, hold on.
[101:15.89]Listen at the door.
[101:16.55]Ooh.
[101:16.91]Here comes the fight.
[101:17.85]Oh, it's locked.
[101:35.70]Carnival of death.
[101:37.10]Gruesome remains.
[101:37.74]Alright, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna, like, hide so she doesn't see me.
[101:43.41]Good thing I got those Sonic hearing buds.
[101:46.15]Oh!
[101:46.23]That was a gunshot.
[101:47.19]Nope.
[102:06.69]So when she walks out, I'm gonna... Okay, here we go.
[102:11.25]Why is the door magically unlocked?
[102:13.85]She didn't even leave.
[102:14.89]Hi!
[102:15.31]Uh, so... I don't know what door that Jeanette just left out of, but hi.
[102:25.22]Just gonna walk around your office for a minute or so here, don't mind me.
[102:28.72]It's a pretty nice computer you have here.
[102:31.02]It would be a shame if somebody fucking hacked the world.
[102:37.55]It's a pretty big bed.
[102:38.69]Is that a strawberry bed?
[102:40.29]If it is, I'm gonna... It's a strawberry bed.
[102:42.61]Unbelievably.
[102:43.15]That's awesome.
[102:45.88]I've always wanted to jump on a strawberry bed.
[102:47.36]It's supposed to be like 10% firmer.
[102:50.24]Than a therapeutic.
[102:51.82]Therapeutic.
[102:52.72]Tempur-pedic.
[102:53.52]Whatever the... Whatever the... The name of that fucking commercial bed that couples lie on with no sheets.
[103:01.81]Uh, email.
[103:07.29]N, X, F. No, again, I... Skill too low.
[103:12.51]I'm like, sorry, I can't hack your computer.
[103:16.29]I tried.
[103:18.64]What else can I do?
[103:19.54]That's locked.
[103:21.80]Hi, my name is Greg.
[103:25.88]Please, come in.
[103:26.88]I do apologize for my sister's crassness, if it made you uncomfortable.
[103:31.39]She's unabashedly scandalous, but in the club business, I suppose that kind of personality is a necessary evil.
[103:37.85]Are you Teresa, the dark daughter of Janus?
[103:41.19]I could stomach her oozing no longer.
[103:42.71]You are Teresa, the dark daughter.
[103:44.43]Therese Vorman, yes.
[103:46.17]I'm the proprietor of this club, and the only person in this city whose good side it's in your best interest to stay on.
[103:52.39]Unless I pull out my knife.
[103:56.78]Uh... Call off your conflict with the worm, Dark One.
[103:59.82]Tongue's exile is self-imposed, I assure you.
[104:02.66]But then, what reason would I have not to hate that loathsome Nosferatu scoundrel?
[104:07.69]Bloody Nosferatu.
[104:08.81]They're so... So what is she?
[104:11.87]Is she a Malkovian?
[104:17.17]I don't want to meddle with your madness.
[104:18.61]Just make a wormy peace.
[104:20.70]Hmm.
[104:21.88]I'd be willing to put the word out that my grievances with Tongue have been swept under the rug, but in return, you'll have to help me remove a particularly burdensome spirit from the property I've come to invest in.
[104:32.38]I gotta clean up some dirty laundry.
[104:35.46]A better use of my time would be anything else.
[104:37.76]Speak your quest, Dark One.
[104:39.04]Spirit, a reflection of the living.
[104:43.65]Perhaps I will send you to the darkest sleep and the worm will praise me.
[104:48.07]Oh.
[104:48.79]I gotta be careful here.
[104:56.34]Do I like it?
[104:57.46]Alright, speak the quest.
[105:06.24]Rumor is that a personal item of a ghost may be used to draw it out or excise it from its haunt.
[105:12.15]While I don't put a lot of stock in hearsay, it's my last option.
[105:16.75]So I want you to go to the Ocean House Hotel, find an item of the spirits, and bring it back.
[105:23.35]Okay.
[105:25.15]I gotta go to the Ocean House Hotel and find an item of the spirits.
[105:28.25]If you will give word to the worm that he is not wanted, I will go.
[105:34.62]Oh, I fully intend to do so.
[105:37.00]You'll find that dealing with me on the whole is appreciably more predictable than dealing with some of the egomaniacs that are my peers.
[105:44.32]So long as our business doesn't go sour, my word is gold.
[105:47.86]Okay.
[105:50.26]Then I am off to the house on the ocean.
[105:54.33]Before I forget, take this.
[105:56.45]The only way to reach the ocean house this time of night is through a tunnel in the sewers.
[106:00.47]You'll need that key to open the gate for that tunnel.
[106:05.24]Okay.
[106:06.52]Tunnel in the sewers.
[106:08.26]If you'll excuse me, I've got situations to set straight.
[106:11.30]Hold on.
[106:13.96]One more thing.
[106:18.64]What deeds need to be done?
[106:20.24]My mind is gone.
[106:21.10]Never mind.
[106:27.72]Shoes on the bed!
[106:29.18]Shoes on the bed, bitch!
[106:31.32]Whoa.
[106:42.07]So sorry I put my shoes on your bed.
[106:43.47]Alright, let's go.
[106:53.58]That was actually pretty terrifying, not gonna lie.
[106:59.36]Alright, go down.
[107:01.58]No.
[107:01.98]There's only one place this elevator can go.
[107:03.82]It's one or two.
[107:05.36]Oh, you fucking dummy.
[107:06.80]Get up here.
[107:11.75]One.
[107:13.97]I'd like to go down to one, please.
[107:17.43]I just have to stand back.
[107:18.77]I was too close.
[107:20.41]My finger could only press two.
[107:28.97]God damn it!
[107:29.49]No!
[107:29.73]Shit!
[107:32.49]Open!
[107:33.31]Open the door!
[107:34.09]What kind of elevator is this?
[107:35.39]Honest to God, open!
[107:41.44]Let's talk to the bartender one more time.
[107:46.18]I don't drink your flavor of libation, farewell.
[107:54.44]Must I cuff you about the head and shoulders?
[107:56.30]Keep leaning into the interrogation light.
[107:59.04]Bye.
[108:16.31]Trying to steal from the register.
[108:17.81]Alright, let's go.
[108:19.11]Time to leave.
[108:29.70]Please mute the music.
[108:31.12]I cannot.
[108:31.56]There is no option to put the music down.
[108:34.73]Okay.
[108:35.77]So...
[108:37.73]Teresa has asked you to go to the Ocean House Hotel and search for a personal item of the spirit that haunts the place and bring it back.
[108:43.49]The only way to get to the Ocean House Hotel is through the sewers.
[108:52.34]Sewers.
[108:57.64]Where are the sewers?
[109:01.17]I guess I'm gonna have to figure that out.
[109:04.27]Here is the train tracks.
[109:08.68]Darkness.
[109:09.36]Emptiness.
[109:15.89]We've got to look for the sewer.
[109:18.21]Sewer.
[109:19.29]Ninja turtles.
[109:21.63]Of some sort, right?
[109:24.17]What's this guy?
[109:24.61]Is this guy one of those, like, protesters outside of PAX?
[109:27.74]Yeah, it is.
[109:28.14]Uh, okay.
[109:38.65]Hey, anytime you guys go to, like, PAX, like, look for the guy that does this.
[109:42.10]Um... Sewer bale bonds?
[109:43.34]What is this?
[109:44.26]Alright.
[110:01.61]I guess these are like... You can do bounty hunting missions?
[110:04.03]A to F. Zero emails.
[110:05.67]Okay.
[110:05.77]A to F.
[110:13.53]Bomb?
[110:14.07]Sea bomb?
[110:15.95]V Cleaver?
[110:17.09]Uh, V Crumb.
[110:20.02]Uh, bond written.
[110:24.46]Two counts public disturbance.
[110:26.46]Drunken nudity.
[110:28.00]Bond amount $5,000.
[110:31.04]Cash.
[110:33.13]Subject's corpse identified.
[110:35.23]Being held at medical clinic morgue.
[110:37.05]Authorities notifying next of kin.
[110:38.57]Huh?
[110:38.65]Huh?
[110:44.28]This guy's in the hospital.
[110:45.10]Holy shit.
[110:45.48]Okay.
[110:45.60]Donuts, pizza, and this guy.
[110:47.08]Okay.
[111:05.34]Are you the Keymaster?
[111:06.18]More like the morgue.
[111:24.21]You alone hold the keys.
[111:25.51]I gotta have a few other bondsmen to keep the place open 24 hours.
[111:28.98]Plus a bounty hunter.
[111:30.60]I pulled a graveyard shift because that's when all the crazy shit happens in Santa Monica.
[111:38.26]Hunting bounties sounds exciting.
[111:39.63]You betcha.
[111:40.99]I used to do some bounty hunting myself back in the day.
[111:44.59]Takes a solid set of brass balls to make a good bounty hunter, I'll tell you that much.
[111:51.41]My brain has questions.
[111:52.33]My brain feels like a big brass bingo chip.
[111:54.48]Farewell.
[111:56.64]We can do this later.
[111:59.72]If you're wondering, for bits, the last four streams, I've been reading them after the stream.
[112:06.63]Just because a lot of these old games, like alt-tabbing to be able to scroll over to my other monitor, can be like a disaster.
[112:16.39]So I can't really scroll over and read them.
[112:20.90]So I'm going to hit them up at the end of the stream.
[112:26.78]Just for these last few days.
[112:28.28]Okay, looking for a sewer entrance.
[112:36.69]Entrance to a sewer.
[112:40.71]Hmm.
[112:42.59]No trespassing.
[112:46.94]Soon it will wash over and carry you all to the damnation sea.
[112:52.98]If I were a sewer, where would I be?
[112:56.38]I would be you.
[112:58.22]Oh, yes, I would.
[113:03.00]Well, that was quick.
[113:03.68]Okay.
[113:07.74]That's Gilbert Godfrey.
[113:08.84]Alright, I probably should, like, take out my knife.
[113:12.82]Because I feel like this is gonna get... This is gonna get awkward down here, I assume.
[113:19.04]Rats?
[113:20.34]Can I do anything with the rats?
[113:21.44]No.
[113:24.68]Uh, you look like you can be opened.
[113:26.36]Can you?
[113:27.72]I guess not.
[113:36.43]Mm-hmm.
[113:38.45]Uh-huh.
[113:38.79]Access point D. Well, this looks like something I need to look at.

[139:10.37]209.
[139:10.67]It's the oldest trick in the book and I fell for it.
[139:30.83]You don't even need to have a mattress.
[139:31.85]I'll just fuck up your frame.
[139:37.53]Somebody just dropped a Burger King crown.
[139:41.88]Did I miss something?
[139:42.46]I think I was supposed to see something here.
[139:48.00]I think I was supposed to see that.
[139:49.22]Um...

[140:03.45]209.
[140:04.51]Where does this go?

[140:18.65]Um.
[140:20.29]Well.
[140:20.65]I'm not entirely sure where to go.
[140:36.18]Why does 2-10- I can't get into 2-10?

[140:47.80]This is the only one that can- Oh, there's a- You missed.
[140:58.07]Alright, I gotta follow her.
[140:59.61]Okay, fine.
[141:00.07]I get it.
[141:00.43]I get how it works.
[141:01.11]We have to chase the girl.
[141:04.73]There she goes!
[141:05.53]Alright, I just made all the jump scares happen at the same time.
[141:16.95]Somebody's door was made out of fucking particle board.
[141:19.42]Stop playing with fireworks in your room.
[141:29.66]Oh god, alright, hold on.
[141:30.88]I gotta...
[141:36.78]Do I have to stay in first person?
[141:37.90]It's kind of making me motion sick.
[141:41.01]Where?
[141:49.63]Goddamn, stop throwing shit at me.
[141:53.58]There's the spider.
[142:02.85]What the fuck?
[142:08.80]Can I turn the gamma up a little?
[142:10.06]Alright, let's take this, like, slow.
[142:21.29]I'm getting caught on the lamp.
[142:22.45]Alright, here's another door.
[142:25.21]There's a bathroom.
[142:26.77]A destroyed shower.
[142:32.14]Nothing of interest.
[142:36.97]Stupid dog, you make me look bad!
[142:38.83]Lookit, lookit, lookit, lookit!
[142:44.50]Okay, that's blocked off.
[142:47.04]218 is this room.
[142:50.04]I think I went in every room I could possibly go in, didn't I?
[142:52.26]I did.
[142:55.67]So what the heck, mate?
[143:05.90]I'm gonna go in the closet.
[143:07.66]Anything in the closet?
[143:09.20]Ow.
[143:13.21]Am I gonna go up here?
[143:14.33]Okay, watch out for the magic.
[143:21.75]He's gonna throw the sofa, isn't he?
[143:23.77]You're gonna throw the sofa and you're gonna throw the dresser and I'm gonna die.
[143:26.77]Save it.
[143:27.03]Okay, it hurts.
[143:32.77]It's not something I want to break.
[143:33.67]Okay, this is a fire.
[143:38.35]This is a fire memory.
[143:40.59]Why is this sparkling?
[143:45.77]Another fire.
[143:48.35]Don't make the jump, right?
[143:51.79]Okay.
[143:54.03]Gas and shit.
[143:55.25]Alright, the whole place is coming down.
[144:00.47]Wasn't I supposed to come in here and get like an item?
[144:02.13]I'm almost dead.
[144:13.29]I think I found it.
[144:13.99]There's the necklace.
[144:19.79]Item gain.
[144:20.79]Retrieve the pendant from the ocean house.
[144:23.27]Okay.
[144:25.89]So, how do I get out of here?
[144:30.52]Reliably.
[144:33.78]Do I have to go through the whole hotel again?
[144:35.46]Okay.
[144:50.60]Oh no.
[144:55.16]Does this work?
[144:55.86]Can I leave?
[144:56.46]Okay.
[144:58.42]I can leave.
[145:00.12]But I just gotta be careful.
[145:01.08]I don't wanna like... I have to jump to the ladder.
[145:09.03]Does it fall damage in this game?
[145:13.85]Oh my god.
[145:17.40]I got it.
[145:17.94]I got it.
[145:18.44]Don't worry.
[145:18.82]I grabbed it.
[145:23.54]Um, that's not what I'm supposed to do.
[145:28.91]I don't think I'm supposed to go this way.
[145:35.08]Yeah, I wasn't supposed to go this way.
[145:36.92]Wait!
[145:37.08]There's an entrance.
[145:38.10]There's a thing right there.
[145:42.82]There's a little place to sneak in.
[145:44.30]No, it's not.
[145:45.04]Alright, just go.
[145:57.11]I'm too fat.
[146:03.27]Get up here.
[146:04.01]Do the crouch up.
[146:11.05]What am I standing on here?
[146:11.91]There we go.
[146:13.07]Okay.
[146:16.12]There it is.
[146:19.06]Time to leave.
[146:19.56]I got what I came for.
[146:22.64]The murders.
[146:23.78]Unsolved murders.
[146:26.68]Bye-bye.
[146:35.46]No, that was interesting.
[146:37.66]At least I got what I wanted.
[146:42.62]Finally, we can leave the horror house.
[146:44.85]Alright, I cracked the case.
[146:49.29]Case has been solved.
[146:50.05]Now I just have to leave.
[146:54.28]Teresa's now on my good side.
[146:58.56]We completed the horror movie.
[147:01.88]My health is back, too.
[147:05.91]What a weird game.
[147:06.61]This is a really weird game, but it's cool.
[147:09.19]So, I have a question.
[147:12.27]Do I have... When do I get points?
[147:14.95]I guess... Okay, I have six... I can put a point in here.
[147:19.48]How am I going to not make my life a living hell?
[147:26.26]You know what I mean?
[147:27.92]Because I can put something in... Should I put something into, like, melee...
[147:37.44]Lockpicking?
[147:38.16]I guess lockpicking would be not stupid.
[147:42.99]Alright, so don't put it into computers.
[147:46.53]So lockpicking is at 1.
[147:47.95]What affects lockpicking?
[147:51.07]Dexterity.
[147:53.32]Dexterity is lockpicking and sneaking.
[147:55.50]Uh, cost 4.
[147:56.86]Do max melee.
[148:08.33]I could do, uh, obfuscate, right?
[148:11.67]You may move invisibly while crouched and perform stealth kills using the attack key.
[148:23.06]I think I want to put it into the stealth killing.
[148:30.84]I think, yeah, I want this.
[148:32.66]This is cool.
[148:35.32]Put it into the dancing step.
[148:40.39]So now I can actually walk around stealth and stealth kill.
[148:45.29]I think I'm okay with this.
[148:49.67]You don't need invisibility?
[148:52.61]Yeah, but still, it makes it easier.
[149:00.42]All the disciplines are good.
[149:02.86]Enhances your mental, allows you to see the auras of those around you.
[149:05.26]So that you can, like, see people through walls, right?
[149:10.33]Alright, this, the unique legacy of the Macopian Clan's dementation laws channels madness and poison to the minds of those around you.
[149:16.77]They cannot be traced back to you and carry no risk of violating the masquerade.
[149:22.89]Brawl, so you can actually fight.
[149:27.37]Unarmed combat.
[149:32.05]Uh, I actually might just put it into dexterity to begin, just so I can have a little bit higher, um, sneaking and lockpicking.
[149:47.24]I think I'm gonna do it.
[149:52.68]Max seduce.
[149:55.14]Yeah, I'm gonna put it in dexterity.
[149:59.83]Obfucate.
[150:07.01]Dex scrub.
[150:08.25]Well, I need to put like one point into it because otherwise I won't be able to open anything.
[150:12.34]Yeah, we're gonna do that.
[150:13.02]That sounds good.
[150:16.04]Hacking, Dex, and Invisibility.
[150:22.46]Don't tell anyone you leveled that up.
[150:24.35]I won't.
[150:24.69]Only you guys know.
[150:26.21]You guys are the only people that know that I leveled that stat up.
[150:28.19]Alright, let's go back.
[150:36.13]Invest into Yahoo.
[150:37.79]No, don't... Hey, you guys know something crazy about Yahoo?
[150:41.71]They're gonna go under real soon.
[150:45.24]Can't even look at that map.
[150:46.20]What's the one that takes me closest to the asylum?
[150:54.97]Insider trading.
[150:55.85]Was it D?
[150:56.29]I think D's the one that came out of, I think.
[150:59.41]Get in there.
[151:05.42]Yahoo.
[151:08.20]Main street.
[151:08.90]Second street.
[151:10.12]Let's get out of first person here.
[151:13.73]This is bad.
[151:14.69]We have to go back this way.
[151:20.25]I haven't heard about that site in years.
[151:21.69]Well, they just, like, keep... They keep, like, losing money and keep losing accounts.
[151:29.36]Alright, so.
[151:30.02]Asylum.
[151:32.10]It's not this way.
[151:33.88]Wait.
[151:34.62]Should I go talk... Let me, like, check on this guy to make sure he's still alive.
[151:42.17]Let's get some advice from the guy that's been dying the whole game.
[151:49.85]Did he get more cuts on his face?
[151:54.42]Here.
[151:54.62]I guess there's nothing else there.
[151:57.24]Why is everybody's voices so low?
[151:58.20]I could raid the hospital, couldn't I?
[152:13.71]I could kill him, too.
[152:15.17]Like, do we really need him around?
[152:24.40]Ask him about the boomsticks?
[152:25.38]Yeah, he said if I do the mission for him, he'll give them to me.
[152:32.50]Alright.
[152:33.90]So.
[152:35.82]Let's go back over here.
[152:37.67]Where was the asylum again?
[152:39.25]Down, like, the alleyways.
[152:42.55]Over here.
[152:48.47]Yeah, over here.
[152:52.27]Buy some clothes.
[152:55.01]Who sells clothes?
[152:57.22]I've yet to find a clothes shop.
[152:59.48]I don't have any money.
[153:00.24]A diner?
[153:04.20]I could go in the diner.
[153:11.92]Oh, Jesus.
[153:13.79]I got a bad feeling about myself in here.
[153:15.45]Can I cut the line?
[153:18.42]What'll it be?
[153:20.20]In the air-spoiled scent on the floor of rodent pellets, you sell filth here.
[153:24.55]Are you the health inspector?
[153:29.13]Uh, I'm putting that sass in my report.
[153:32.13]You know, at least the last health inspector had the decency to make it clear when he was asking for a bribe.
[153:37.42]Here's 50 bucks.
[153:38.66]I get to live the dream for another exciting month.
[153:41.60]Yay.
[153:43.00]Okay, hey.
[153:44.58]And just like that, we make 50 dollars.
[153:47.80]I must seek other opportunities for my corruption farewell.
[153:51.30]Hey.
[153:51.52]What'll it be?
[153:52.18]It's me, the health inspector again.
[153:54.68]Oh, shit.
[153:55.30]Can I not buy anything now?
[154:00.10]Hey, what is it, smooth skin?
[154:01.66]It's me, a ghoul.
[154:04.92]Ugh, my bunions are killing me.
[154:07.54]I want to talk to you.
[154:08.33]No, I really don't.
[154:11.45]I want to talk to this guy.
[154:14.67]Hey, buddy.
[154:16.11]Go your own way.
[154:17.80]Evening.
[154:19.66]So does nobody... Do people know you're a vampire?
[154:22.06]Or does it, like... I mean, look at me.
[154:26.33]If we're in a world of vampires, you think you wouldn't want to piss off the guy that I look like?
[154:33.59]What do they got at the movie theater candy counter?
[154:36.93]Uh, let's see.
[154:38.95]They've got... Eat.
[154:42.80]Day Day.
[154:45.95]Fat bar, fix, eat pounds, fifth venue, 100 rando, Mr. Goo Goo, big lunk, hers, his, king, bubble, milky man.
[155:04.22]Okay, Mr. Goo Goo is definitely the best one so far.
[155:08.93]Mr. Goo Goo and big lunk might be my favorites here.
[155:14.97]Thanks for the free money.
[155:19.39]Mr. Goo Goo.
[155:25.51]Okay, let's complete this after I look in here.
[155:29.46]Foxy boxes.
[155:30.30]Can't even go in.
[155:41.28]I still need clothes.
[155:42.32]Alright, let's go back up.
[155:46.26]Is she still in her room?
[155:51.74]I don't know.
[155:52.06]I'm sure we'll find out.
[155:55.64]Two.
[155:59.84]I'm ignoring the characters that have dialogue.
[156:01.70]Wait, what?
[156:06.50]Alright.
[156:06.90]Uh-oh.
[156:09.71]You're not the person that I talked to originally.
[156:11.47]Yes, I am.
[156:12.14]Ah.
[156:39.36]I'm gonna go with four here.
[156:40.54]Oh, God.
[156:41.16]Like Bingo, without the chips, just take me to your sister.
[156:44.27]The perfect chance to plant my foot in it.
[156:46.31]Now, where is the Dark Daughter?
[156:48.37]Uh...
[157:10.01]Just take me to your sister.
[157:11.82]Therese is out making a show of how well her lips fit on the pants seat of the Camarilla.
[157:17.06]Did you happen to find her chastity belt or something?
[157:20.50]I have a bauble for the Daughter of Darkness.
[157:22.34]I can speak only with your other face, Daughter of Janus.
[157:26.81]I'm not going to let you intrude.
[157:28.81]Therese told me you might be back with something for her.
[157:31.21]Do you have it with you?
[157:33.65]Yes, here's the ghost of the locket.
[157:35.23]Your sister only... Like,, no.
[157:38.24]I'm...
[157:39.72]I'm going to use her mind here.
[157:41.08]You know what I mean?
[157:42.40]Use your brain, guys.
[157:45.58]She's going to try to take it from me and fuck the whole thing up.
[157:49.68]No, get out of my way.
[157:51.04]I'm not just some silly doll, you know.
[157:54.32]All my life, my sisters made me out to be a joke.
[157:57.61]She told you I was an embarrassment, didn't she?
[157:59.89]That I couldn't tie my shoes, let alone hold on to something for her.
[158:03.01]Is that it?
[158:06.17]You stole the words from my head.
[158:09.45]Hold on to the knowledge that you mean nothing to me.
[158:13.23]Jesus Christ.
[158:17.50]You mean fucking nothing to me.
[158:18.48]She's always belittling me.
[158:20.36]She's the smart one.
[158:21.26]She's the favorite.
[158:22.08]She's the successful one.
[158:23.24]Well, it's not fair.
[158:24.88]I'm not a fool.
[158:26.14]This club's success is just as much my doing as it is hers.
[158:30.16]No tears, daughter of Janice.
[158:31.58]Take the locket.
[158:33.23]Your sobbings are driving me crazier, crazier.
[158:35.65]Take it and be silent.
[158:36.57]These pathetic warblings fall on undead ears.
[158:39.77]My heart is open, but your hand will not contain your desire.
[158:42.68]Yeah, get out of my way.
[158:47.38]Do you understand what it's like to have your own flesh and blood ripping you apart on a daily basis for two lifetimes?
[158:53.03]Can you?
[158:56.68]Spectacular tantrum.
[158:58.09]The child gets the toy.
[158:59.89]I can take no more of this.
[159:01.19]Accept this and stop your wailings.
[159:03.13]Forgiveness, white daughter, but this is for the other only.
[159:05.87]Your sister and none other harlot.
[159:08.73]Fine.
[159:09.35]You hold on to it.
[159:11.77]Since you're so willing to brave that big spooky place for my darling sister, how about doing a teensy tiny favor for little troubled me?
[159:20.58]What deed?
[159:21.50]I got a point.
[159:25.34]uh quest log what deed do you propose the girl is straight and always may speak true I do nothing more for the daughters of Janice what deed could I do to amuse the rainy day child
[159:35.63]Do you know Galerie Noire down the street?
[159:37.81]I happen to know there's a charity event being organized there.
[159:40.95]Lots of influential Santa Monicans slithering in for token appearances.
[159:45.68]But there's one thing they don't know.
[159:48.54]The whole event's been set up by a kindred trying to establish their own power clique in our city.
[159:54.20]And we can't let that happen, can we?
[159:56.92]So I need some brilliant young upstart to spoil the milk.
[160:05.79]What dastardly deed.
[160:07.05]Slashing is now my existence.
[160:08.35]You free the worm after these slashings?
[160:34.16]I will not destroy the brainchild of another.
[160:40.51]Slashing is now my existence.
[160:41.55]Alright.
[160:59.29]I will think of you only as I slash these splatterings.
[161:02.91]We will finish worm business when I return, or you will be my next painting.
[161:07.23]Oh, and there was something about the paintings.
[161:09.99]Hmm, what was it?
[161:11.91]I can't remember.
[161:13.29]Oh well, have fun, Duckling.
[161:15.41]We will.
[161:20.81]What's in the bathroom?
[161:21.39]You got any, like, soaps I can steal?
[161:22.57]No.
[161:24.33]Alright, so where's Teresa?
[161:31.63]Hold on.
[161:31.99]Okay, the ghost... You retrieve the pendant from the Ocean House to bring to Teresa's payment to convince her to call off the feud with Tongue, but she wasn't at the asylum.
[161:38.06]You should check back later to talk to her when she returns.
[161:42.42]Okay.
[161:43.92]So go... This is... I guess this is just what we're doing.
[161:45.96]Go to the Gallery Noir in Santa Monica and slash the paintings inside and steal the charity box.
[161:55.32]Okay.
[161:58.44]Let's go be a bad guy.
[162:02.07]Sounds like fun.
[162:06.51]How do you close?
[162:08.34]Bad.
[162:08.70]Time to reset.
[162:17.06]Not interested.
[162:17.74]Alright, let's go.
[162:31.26]Isn't Gallery Noir, like, right across the street?
[162:37.59]Somebody wrote, dance stream waiting room.
[162:42.85]It's the rain.
[162:44.67]Okay, I kind of want to, like, murder somebody.
[162:46.85]It's been, like, at least ten minutes and somebody's, like, died.
[162:49.55]I haven't killed anybody in a long time.
[162:54.43]I'm getting, like, the itch to kill somebody.
[162:57.37]You know?
[163:00.11]Let's go to the gallery.
[163:05.51]Gallery was... This way?
[163:09.23]Over here?
[163:12.38]Gallery Noir.
[163:14.00]Be the naked guy that's completely out of place.
[163:16.44]Gallery Noir.
[163:17.32]There it is.
[163:21.86]What about like the fat security guard?
[163:23.16]Huh?
[163:23.54]What?
[163:23.82]To the guy next to you?
[163:25.56]Your mind will shatter on the hollowness of your life.
[163:46.00]Yes.
[163:51.00]Flowing fat will ferment your furrows.
[164:00.11]Did he just drop the key?
[164:02.81]Holy shit, that was easy.
[164:05.99]This is the best class in the game.
[164:12.04]Alright.
[164:15.49]Just destroy the paintings.
[164:17.15]There's nobody even in here.
[164:18.31]I'm on off hours.
[164:19.11]And there's the charity box.
[164:20.79]It's so easy.
[164:24.14]I just told that guy he was too fat and he died.
[164:26.64]Okay, let's do it.
[164:34.81]Huh?
[164:37.09]Cain slays Abel.
[164:43.92]Cain spurns Lilith.
[164:45.52]We gotta do it in the right order, okay?
[164:47.00]Cain, cursed by God.
[164:50.82]Cain meets Lilith.
[164:53.55]And then Cain slays Abel.
[164:54.95]No, I mean then Cain spurns Lilith.
[164:59.17]Hey, I did it.
[165:04.31]And they all come together to give me a reward of +2 experience.
[165:11.76]What the fuck?
[165:19.18]He dodged every single thing.
[165:26.36]Fuck.
[165:27.76]I need a gun.
[165:32.96]Shit.
[165:33.52]Easy.
[165:35.28]Blood buff.
[165:45.59]Who told me I couldn't do it?
[165:46.85]Who told me I couldn't do it?
[165:49.08]I want names.
[165:54.94]Alright, that's good.
[165:56.58]Quest complete.
[165:59.39]Holster.
[166:00.31]Charity box.
[166:02.03]There it is.
[166:06.67]Like, I was singing that song.
[166:07.67]What was it?
[166:08.05]The, uh... What's the name of the song?
[166:10.77]It goes like... Ah, ah-hoo-hoo.
[166:12.79]Ah, ah-hoo-hoo.
[166:14.21]Ah, ah-hoo-hoo.
[166:19.75]Can you lure somebody?
[166:20.63]How do you lure somebody back here?
[166:21.76]Do I have enough skill?
[166:29.40]Success.
[166:31.76]What's in the side room?
[166:35.94]Oh, it's the same thing.
[166:37.54]Nothing changed.
[166:38.18]It's just the same thing.
[166:39.44]I could either go lockpick or not lockpick.
[166:42.04]Okay.
[166:49.30]Don't kill Officer Chunk.
[166:50.46]I wasn't going to kill him, I was going to drink his delicious, fatty plasma blood.
[166:58.78]That's how it works, right?
[167:01.24]This guy's blood has a lot of fat.
[167:05.16]So I would be drinking up, it would be like drinking a cheeseburger.
[167:10.86]The fattier they are, the better they taste, right?
[167:14.76]It's like bacon.
[167:15.36]If you buy, like, thick-cut bacon, it's gonna be better than if you buy, like, turkey bacon.
[167:18.56]Because turkey bacon's good, but it's not, it doesn't get that, like, fat in it.
[167:22.34]I'm going to need a shower.
[167:26.58]Ugh.
[167:27.30]Alright, let's convince this guy to give me some money.
[167:31.73]Afraid I'm a little short on cash right now.
[167:34.01]I'm so sorry.
[167:35.97]Um, then why don't we take a walk?
[167:38.01]I'm happily married to my work.
[167:41.41]And I have a wife, too.
[167:45.57]Eventually it's going to give me money?
[167:51.15]Well, whatever.
[167:53.05]Let's go back.
[167:54.95]I need to find clothes.
[167:56.83]Can I do anything in here yet?
[167:59.41]Get out of the way.
[168:01.91]No, I'm not looking for a date.
[168:03.89]Affirmative.
[168:06.67]I want to go into the hospital.
[168:07.77]Alright.
[168:10.63]I'm about to start slashing if I can't get into the hospital.
[168:18.57]His turkey bacon is really good.
[168:19.83]I already convinced her that I can go over here, right?
[168:23.11]Yeah.
[168:23.31]Alright, let's check on the girl.
[168:24.75]How you doing?
[168:28.99]Not so good.
[168:29.45]Alright, what about the doctor?
[168:32.74]Is that guy still in there?
[168:34.52]You've been working on the same patient for so long.
[168:37.68]I told you, I will get to you when I can.
[168:40.18]Please take a seat.
[168:41.00]If I could only rest for a second.
[168:48.24]How are his vitals?
[168:50.36]I don't know.
[168:50.66]You tell me.
[168:51.16]You're the one that's supposed to be checking.
[168:52.30]Uh-oh.
[168:55.28]I think I see the problem here.
[168:59.48]You've got a cell phone in your chest.
[169:02.57]You're missing Two Fingers.
[169:06.95]And you, like, didn't... Shit, I need blood.
[169:11.71]Get a crosscut in here.
[169:15.04]Oh, fuck.
[169:15.52]Okay.
[169:16.12]Somebody has to die.
[169:18.18]Somebody has to die.
[169:19.10]Nobody can see me do it, though.
[169:28.28]How do I... I don't want to use a blood bag.
[169:30.14]I'm going to have to use a blood bag, aren't I?
[169:34.10]Yeah, I'm going to use a blood bag.
[169:37.93]Okay.
[169:42.42]Let's go back until all the deed is done.
[169:43.90]And continue the quest.
[169:48.78]Get that high quality doctor blood.
[169:53.58]It's not like, it's like making a baby.
[169:55.32]You know what I mean?
[169:57.16]You're like, who do you wanna, who do you wanna like make a baby with?
[169:59.76]Doctor?
[170:00.62]PhD?
[170:01.98]Scientist?
[170:02.96]It's no different.
[170:05.46]You're making a baby inside your mouth.
[170:08.74]Have you seen the dance yet?
[170:26.74]No, don't go to one ah What was that analogy it was called like when people like want to make a baby you're looking for like a mate You're looking for somebody that you want to like spend the rest of your life with So would you like combine your bodies together and you make a baby?
[170:42.30]It'll have like the doctor PhD brain like oh, I want to date a doctor because It'll be a smart baby.
[170:49.60]What were you thinking?
[170:51.68]I err about... The museum.
[170:54.06]That was my event!
[170:55.24]Did you think I wouldn't find out?
[170:56.60]Oh, shit.
[170:59.51]Uh... Wait.
[171:04.35]Shut up.
[171:05.45]I thought I could control my sister as long as tongue was out of the picture.
[171:08.73]But nothing's changed.
[171:10.35]I should have expected that you'd succumb to Jeanette's influence like all the others.
[171:14.18]But how dare you?! !
[171:16.41]I don't know what your lips are saying.
[171:17.82]Don't lie to me.
[171:19.30]Jeanette already confessed she tricked you into doing it.
[171:21.72]Well, she tricked me.
[171:22.32]There you go.
[171:22.62]It was probably all Tung's idea.
[171:24.18]No.
[171:24.42]We'll deal with them later.
[171:26.18]But that's still no excuse for you ruining my museum.
[171:29.42]But see, I have brought you the ghostly bauble.
[171:31.42]But see, I have brought you the ghostly bauble.
[171:33.34]My museum is wrecked.
[171:35.15]Do you understand?
[171:36.25]Now, if you'd like to atone, or if you'd like to provide further assurance of your innocence, I have one more task that has to be dealt with.
[171:45.57]What new deed is this?
[171:46.79]A word bond held no clauses.
[171:49.22]Free the worm or I will free your slippery skull from its anchors.
[171:53.06]Incompetence I can forgive.
[171:54.90]Somewhat.
[171:55.72]Threats, on the other hand, I do not tolerate.
[171:58.92]If you want to stay in my good graces, if you want to accomplish this goal of finding tongue, I suggest you do what I ask.
[172:07.21]What further quest to talk one?
[172:09.23]I made some threats against my sister.
[172:11.51]Idle threats involving fire and her impious satin sheets.
[172:15.24]She took them quite seriously and is avoiding me.
[172:17.64]I want to meet with her and explain that they were set in the heat of the moment.
[172:21.32]I asked her to meet me at the Surfside Diner to reconcile.
[172:24.73]But I'm busy with the club and my other endeavors.
[172:27.29]I'd like you to go to the diner and promise her that I don't plan to take any action against her.
[172:31.01]I don't want to be like this back and forth messenger.
[172:33.81]Oh, God.
[172:34.69]This is more convoluted than my psyche.
[172:37.28]I will find her and then we finish this.
[172:40.18]Roses for her when they should be stones, dear Baron.
[172:45.31]I want to see my sister.
[172:47.23]Yes, I'll call it off once I've spoken with her myself.
[172:50.25]Just do what I ask.
[172:51.59]Mm-hmm, done and done.
[172:53.31]Thanks for nothing.
[172:55.22]But I do have, uh, points.
[172:57.76]Okay, let's go with... Finance.
[173:04.20]Your character's ability to evaluate the market value of items.
[173:06.70]Finance is needed for the Hagglefeet.
[173:10.64]Um...
[173:13.92]Intelligence, wits.
[173:17.48]We gotta get like a combat skill in here.
[173:19.62]Firearms, security.
[173:24.30]Melee.
[173:27.11]Knives and swords.
[173:28.61]Yeah.
[173:31.31]Takes five.
[173:31.99]I'm just gonna do it again.
[173:36.81]What is it?
[173:37.37]I need six?
[173:38.27]Okay, we'll do one in melee.
[173:41.02]We'll do, can I do one in, uh, yeah, I can do one in, um, in Obfuscate.
[173:46.87]Melee, Obfuscate, and that's good for now.
[173:54.93]My Obfuscate is much better now.
[173:57.87]Okay, go to the diner.
[174:02.85]Time to go, time to go have some din-din.
[174:06.99]Finally, am I gonna get to kill somebody?
[174:12.21]This last, like, hour has been go to a haunted house and then watch two sisters get annoyed with each other.
[174:23.74]Drink someone's blood?
[174:24.60]I need, how do you, like, is there, like, a Metal Gear Solid, like, you know what I mean?
[174:30.90]What's the Metal Gear Solid button where you lean up against the wall and you go...
[174:42.93]CQC.
[174:43.61]Because nobody can see me do it.
[174:46.59]I have to go down, like, an alleyway and... Drink the doctor in the hospital.
[174:55.58]I might!
[174:59.04]Where's, like, the unsuspecting person?
[175:00.44]Come on, like, how do I, like, make somebody walk in a different direction?
[175:08.89]Just go get a prostitute and then drink from her.
[175:11.80]Yeah, but that's 50 bucks.
[175:14.32]Like, how much?
[175:18.65]It's 50 bucks.
[175:21.61]No.
[175:22.07]You're talking to somebody else.
[175:27.99]No, I'm not spending 50 dollars to drink somebody's blood.
[175:31.41]Let's go to the diner.
[175:32.33]Let's see if we can drag somebody from the... I want to drink this guy.
[175:36.31]This guy's blood.
[175:38.63]I'm already crazy enough.
[175:39.67]I don't need any more of this guy's blood, but...
[175:43.28]Can't do anything.
[175:43.84]Alright, what about this guy?
[175:45.52]Okay, here we go.
[175:47.55]Nobody.
[175:48.81]Nobody.
[175:49.15]Oh, easy.
[175:51.13]The easiest fucking bite I've ever had in my life.
[175:53.23]I'm gonna do this just in case.
[175:57.59]Nobody saw that?
[175:58.73]Does this guy have any blood?
[176:01.13]This guy has no blood.
[176:15.07]I just drank half this guy's blood.
[176:16.43]He has like two teaspoons.
[176:18.29]How is he alive?
[176:18.99]That guy's barely alive.
[176:31.32]Okay, whatever.
[176:31.86]I want to drink this guy so bad.
[176:45.52]Alright, back to the diner.
[176:47.56]Which is this way.
[176:51.34]Someone got to him first.
[176:55.19]Go in the back.

[177:14.32]This guy has a shotgun!
[177:23.40]Why?
[177:30.14]Don't- What the fuck just happened?
[177:46.57]When I'm done with this, you pick up that phone!
[177:48.77]Oh fuck, I killed him.
[177:51.57]I- shit.
[177:54.03]Oh shit, I gotta run the store now.
[177:58.20]What is this, a gun?
[178:00.58]Feed attempt failed?
[178:01.78]What are you talking about?
[178:02.56]I tried to eat the gun.
[178:08.14]I tried to let go!
[178:09.06]Where's the phone?
[178:11.22]This phone.
[178:11.92]Hold on.
[178:12.26]Did I get all the items?
[178:21.69]Okay, everything's good.
[178:22.39]I have a shotgun now.
[178:25.11]Hello?
[178:25.71]Yes?
[178:25.79]Patience, white mistress.
[178:30.85]Tell me what troubles you.
[178:32.15]What need have I... This is horseshit.
[178:33.33]They're playing... I think I'm being played by both of them.
[178:54.90]Hold on.
[178:55.24]Can she hold?
[178:56.16]Because I have to use the bathroom in real life.
[178:58.14]I'm going to take a minute to think.
[178:59.04]I'm not even holding the phone.
[179:01.28]Yeah.
[179:02.06]I'm pretend holding this.
[179:04.04]I'm just adjusting my glasses.
[179:05.32]I got to pee.
[179:09.94]I'm going to think about this while I pee.
[179:11.97]No BRB screen.
[179:14.49]Be right back.
[179:18.41]Think about this.
[179:20.85]Because I'll be...
[179:54.54]Wait...
[179:55.20]WHAT?! !
[181:15.72]Okay.
[181:18.78]So, we decided.
[181:19.90]Patience.
[181:21.18]Here's what I think is happening here.
[181:23.35]Fuck, I didn't even get a drink.
[181:25.33]I'm an idiot.
[181:27.09]I went pee so I could get more room to get a drink.
[181:32.58]Oh well.
[181:34.69]I think that Teresa didn't do anything.
[181:38.25]I think that actually Janet, Jeanette, is pretending that Teresa did that.
[181:44.99]She actually called in the murder.
[181:47.25]So she's playing this weird, crazy game here.
[181:50.41]I'm going to say what need to buy a few.
[181:51.63]Teresa's going to kill us.
[181:52.99]Without me, you'll never get out of Santa Monica alive.
[181:55.51]Okay.
[181:55.85]Why?
[181:57.47]Why?
[182:01.37]Here I come to save the day.
[182:02.95]Death is not as peaceful as I had hoped.
[182:04.75]Okay, well... Death is not as peaceful as I had hoped.
[182:11.89]So she's in the bathroom.
[182:19.76]Not this bathroom, apparently.
[182:21.94]Let's put on the shotgun.
[182:33.31]Probably shouldn't carry this around.
[182:36.63]What bathroom are you in?
[182:38.39]Is she in the bathroom of the... Wait, register.
[182:47.22]Really?
[182:47.70]I can't take any... There's zero dollars in there.
[182:50.42]I didn't mean to kill this guy.
[182:55.60]Is she hiding in the bathroom of the hotel?
[182:57.82]Because I can't go in this bathroom.
[183:01.12]And by hotel, I mean dance club.
[183:02.62]And by dance club, I mean, like, bondage party.
[183:04.98]And by bondage party, I mean just the place where they both are.
[183:07.41]It's okay.
[183:18.09]She's in the bathroom here.
[183:24.78]Where's the bathroom?
[183:29.68]Alright, bathroom.
[183:33.28]Bathroom?
[183:35.30]It's the lady's room.
[183:39.96]No, I think she's up in the... She might be... I think she's in their bathroom.
[183:44.05]Okay.
[183:53.71]It's an elaborate ruse.
[183:55.20]I'm going to go in there and it's going to be... She was double-crossing me.
[183:58.74]It's alright.
[183:59.66]I have a shotgun.
[184:00.46]I'm ready to fight if need be.
[184:04.93]Oh, she wasn't lying.
[184:09.90]You stay out of this to think anyone would risk their life for this filthy tainted waste of blood This will just make it easier to kill both of you Save me, and I'll help you find Bertram.
[184:20.70]I swear shut up Jeanette.
[184:22.97]I warned you the same fucking person.
[184:25.15]Oh my god.

[184:49.53]I'm about to rid the night of this deviant backstabbing whore.
[184:53.69]She's gonna shoot herself.
[184:54.89]Despite her condition, she still fornicates with kind, no less.
[185:00.61]So despicable.
[185:02.28]So unclean.
[185:03.48]She's nuts.
[185:04.58]She's a Maccobian.
[185:05.86]Okay.
[185:06.10]Or should I say daddy's little girl?
[185:07.78]I get it now.
[185:08.18]Do you want to know just how depraved the Baron of Santa Monica can be?
[185:11.82]Shut up.
[185:13.32]You'd love the world to think you're a saint.
[185:16.00]When you thought I was asleep, I used to hear Father come in at night.
[185:19.76]I heard him whisper how much he loved you in your ear before he... Don't finish that sentence or you're dead.
[185:29.60]Please continue.
[185:32.25]Do not let her exude you of past, Doctor.
[185:34.41]Please continue.
[185:36.35]Keep it going.
[185:36.89]I'm going to be back here for a while.
[185:41.82]Let's go with, um... Don't let her exhume you.
[185:44.97]Don't you wanna hear what happened?
[185:46.43]How she became the pillar of the community she is today?
[185:49.21]Shut up.
[185:50.14]Just shut up!
[185:52.08]Stop it, Ivory.
[185:53.58]Go on, Ivory.
[185:54.62]Oh god.
[185:57.72]But if she's... It's the same person anyways.
[186:00.56]I'm going to say stop it.
[186:01.26]But wait, this doesn't make any sense.
[186:02.30]The painting is two people.
[186:14.69]You've done nothing but keep me down.
[186:16.81]Blame me for every mistake.
[186:18.69]Did you expect me to let you rule my life until the end of time?
[186:21.19]Who were the two people in the painting?
[186:22.35]No, sister.
[186:23.23]You've had it coming since our last sunrise.
[186:25.37]Is that right, dear?
[186:26.74]If it wasn't for me, you would have never survived this long.
[186:29.56]Remember?
[186:30.30]They tried to separate us, but I refused.
[186:32.58]I chose this life and brought you into it so that we could stay together.
[186:36.48]Obviously, you've forgotten.
[186:42.54]Honestly like the way that I'm talking is making this more confusing because I don't even know who I'm referring to Does the dark daughter speak the true of kiss a dark the bad Jeanette is the dark daughter of Teresa's the white daughter, right?
[186:59.11]I'm confusing myself trying to read this Wait Teresa is the dark one
[187:15.74]Okay, so I want to save Janet.
[187:21.22]Okay.
[187:22.28]So I'm like on the Janet side here.
[187:26.20]Just shoot them both and be done with it.
[187:27.60]Alright, we're going to go with...
[187:37.32]So white is... Okay, does the... She owes you nothing.
[187:41.27]No, does the... Yeah, this one.
[187:42.35]She's a control freak.
[187:43.61]People, things, emotions.
[187:45.49]If she can't control something, she gets rid of it.
[187:47.87]And you're a wild animal.
[187:48.99]I'm fucking confused.
[187:50.15]It's two crazy people talking to each other.
[187:52.11]Then when you're stopped and bored, you bite the hand that fed you.
[187:56.38]You are a sickly little thorn from the beginning, white daughter.
[187:58.58]Yes, the dark one called down to the reaper on me.
[188:05.39]yes trees will never let you live you disappointed her I used you yes but I didn't try to have you killed Therese has no problem with killing do you remember father father loved me I was a good girl I always did what I was told you always hated that he loved me you disobeyed him you brought men home when he wasn't there you were an awful daughter to him what of Janice white mistress what of Janice dark god daughter
[188:32.42]No, it's two crazy.
[188:33.50]I'm also crazy.
[188:34.56]So we got three crazy people here.
[188:38.13]One on her side with his two in there and then one on my side.
[188:45.41]Okay.
[188:49.19]The business one is the black and the Harley Quinn one is the white.
[188:54.33]What of Janice?
[188:55.01]I was always good to father.
[188:56.83]But Jeanette made him miserable.
[188:58.69]Over the years it all became too much for him.
[189:01.30]I think she broke his heart.
[189:02.44]So he killed himself right in our room.
[189:04.74]Killed himself?
[189:05.98]Therese, you placed his finger on the trigger once you blew his mind all over the silly clown wallpaper.
[189:12.34]Right after he found me in your bed and thought I was you.
[189:15.16]He was always angry at you.
[189:17.09]You drove him to drink.
[189:18.73]When he died he was in torment.
[189:20.59]As I recall, he died with a smile on his face.
[189:27.44]I don't believe your hollow words, white daughter.
[189:29.61]No, I don't.
[189:33.32]As you shouldn't.
[189:34.60]I'm afraid, sister, I must write your ending in this family's saga.
[189:38.72]And I want you to know I do so with great anguish and disappointment.
[189:42.44]I had such hopes that you'd change for the better with my guidance.
[189:46.01]But so, sweet sister, is this how it has to end?
[189:49.07]I admit I always knew this night might come.
[189:52.55]Well, any message you want me to give father?
[189:55.69]An apology?
[189:56.48]A love letter?
[190:01.41]Grab the boomstick, Ivory Princess.
[190:04.08]Give me the gun!
[190:05.86]Give me the gun!
[190:08.02]Give me the gun!
[190:10.86]What, who, what happened?
[190:15.32]What?
[190:15.72]What just happened?
[190:17.20]I think, I think Jeanette's dead.
[190:32.88]No, they're both alive.
[190:37.33]I saved them both.
[190:42.31]Okay, this is acceptable.
[190:48.86]Tongue's hiding out in an abandoned oil tank at the old gas station.
[190:51.98]No, this is Jeanette.
[190:52.78]I'll tell him that one condition of a truce is that he help you.
[190:56.62]Our business then is finally complete.
[190:58.59]Jeanette's fine.
[190:59.07]What you witnessed here, not a word to anyone.
[191:02.60]I saved them both.
[191:03.92]Guys.
[191:05.48]Everybody told me that I was wrong.
[191:06.97]I saved them both.
[191:12.93]I saved Jeanette and I saved Teresa.
[191:14.61]She's had the thing on the side.
[191:16.21]This is the one I wanted to save in the first place.
[191:23.39]What do you mean?
[191:23.91]I killed the wrong one.
[191:31.35]Only the ghost of the white princess will know.
[191:33.22]I am gone.
[191:35.20]This one's better.
[191:39.00]I'll remember that.
[191:39.66]Goodbye.
[191:40.48]This whole time I was crouching.
[191:42.12]See?
[192:00.90]I killed the wrong one.
[192:01.90]What if I wanted... What if I wanted this one to be alive?
[192:07.34]Huh?
[192:08.48]The sister is like more deliberate.
[192:10.29]The other one was a Loose Cannon.
[192:27.86]Which one... Alright, let me ask you something, chat.
[192:32.18]Which one is this?
[192:35.26]Huh?
[192:36.34]Who is this?
[192:55.17]Look, the first 10 people, half of you got it wrong.
[193:04.79]Jason.
[193:07.23]Yeah, alright, listen, listen.
[193:13.53]Come on, let me talk, let's talk about this while we dance.
[193:17.20]My original plan, Teresa is the one that was supposed to talk to tongue.
[193:25.04]So I had to keep her around.
[193:27.22]I tried to be the middle man.
[193:29.26]I couldn't.
[193:30.90]Sure, you get set up, but guess what?
[193:32.26]Sometimes you have to get set up to get to the end.
[193:34.36]You gotta use your mind.
[193:41.74]I was playing them both because I knew the hit was by Teresa.
[193:47.54]And Janet was a liability, let's be clear.
[193:55.15]Could've kept them both.
[193:56.01]Maybe I didn't want to keep them both.
[194:02.52]Fucked up and tried to act like it.
[194:04.20]How do you- Alright, look.
[194:05.76]How do you fuck up in an RPG like this?
[194:08.64]It's not possible.
[194:11.20]There's no- There's like a bunch of different choices.
[194:15.71]Because- So you're saying that every other choice is the wrong choice.
[194:19.43]Except for this one choice that you wanted.
[194:22.23]It's a fucking RPG.
[194:25.61]What are we talking about?
[194:26.75]Yeah, let's do this one.
[194:40.42]Dude's been called off.
[194:41.14]He's talking about hiding in an oil tank not far from the ascent.
[194:43.60]The outcome is the same.
[194:47.66]Janet lives, Theresa lives, they both live, they both die.
[194:51.30]It's a series of choices.
[194:56.40]This is not an RPG.
[194:57.52]It's a real life.
[195:00.82]You didn't make the choice that I wanted.
[195:08.36]I wanted to save Jeanette, but I murdered her.
[195:10.01]But no!
[195:10.45]But like, I thought she set me up.
[195:12.37]And it turned out that she was actually, pretty much, she was a liability.
[195:14.85]So, I got rid of her.
[195:18.19]Alright, let's go.
[195:22.95]If you did the tutorial, you know you killed the wrong one.
[195:30.33]You must meet with him and get him to show you a way into the warehouse of the explosive.
[195:33.85]Okay, so he's hiding in an oil tank not far from the asylum.
[195:40.00]Oil tank.
[195:41.30]You got it.
[195:46.36]What do you mean Jeanette didn't set me up?
[195:51.24]Wasn't Jeanette the one that made me go destroy the art gallery?
[195:58.60]So she did set me up.
[196:00.22]She did.
[196:00.56]I got set up by her in the very beginning of the goddamn game.
[196:12.67]Theresa's the one that tried to kill you in the diner.
[196:15.85]Yeah, because I fucked up her paintings.
[196:21.58]That's a rational thing to do if somebody fucks up your paintings.
[196:28.21]I got set up by both of them.
[196:30.15]So for all I care, fucking both.
[196:33.37]We got like the business one.
[196:35.11]We got the business savvy one.
[196:36.45]Where's this oil tank?
[196:45.42]No, see, I think you guys, I think a lot of you guys are mad because we got rid of the one that looked like Harley Quinn.
[196:53.10]That was, that was my biggest mistake.
[196:57.63]Can't move this.
[197:00.41]Remember, always keep the one that looks like Harley Quinn.
[197:05.47]Otherwise the internet will eat you alive.
[197:07.35]Alright, where is this guy?
[197:12.91]Oil tank.
[197:20.79]Oil tank by the asylum.
[197:26.95]Yes it is Nice night to come for a piss in an alleyway Thanks for the blood
[197:55.45]Over here?
[197:55.83]Nope.
[197:59.66]That looks like an oil tanker.
[198:00.58]This opens.
[198:02.80]Alright.
[198:08.96]What?
[198:11.02]What kind of an odd... How do you have a computer in here?
[198:14.85]I need to investigate this.
[198:17.33]This computer is connected to up here.
[198:21.65]How do you have electricity in here?
[198:25.94]Look who finally made it.
[198:26.82]Thought you'd never find me, huh?
[198:29.58]I've gotten good at knowing when I'm wanted.
[198:43.51]nasty dude oh real nasty dude nasty dude hey I may not be a looker kid but you better start showing some respect because I could squash you like a freaking bug if my panties get all bunched up you got it yeah
[199:00.27]The world is shown to me even when I'm blind.
[199:03.13]Oh, shit.
[199:04.35]Malkavian.
[199:06.35]I suppose I'll figure out what the hell you're talking about in a month or so.
[199:10.29]Man, I hate talking to you guys.
[199:12.91]I always feel like I'm getting an answer to a question I haven't even asked yet.
[199:18.73]Oh, well.
[199:19.49]Does this guy have two personalities?
[199:22.11]Bertram Trung, the nasty dude.
[199:24.99]The one and only.
[199:26.85]Don't bother with the introductions, fledglings.
[199:29.53]I know who you are.
[199:32.99]Somebody gave $50.
[199:34.25]Jake, again, gave another $50.
[199:38.42]And again, I can see that.
[199:40.04]That's like the last one I can see.
[199:41.88]I can see like a couple of them in a row here.
[199:44.96]But I'll make sure I hit up all these bits when the stream ends.
[199:49.32]I'll make sure.
[199:50.88]Like I said before, I'm just terrified to do any alt-tabbing or moving to my second monitor because all these old games are very unstable when played on the newer operating systems.
[200:02.89]So I just want to be careful.
[200:04.89]But $50 from Jake right here.
[200:09.21]Thanks a lot, man.
[200:10.94]You haven't played Cry of Fear since 2013.
[200:13.36]I really think you should try to single player.
[200:17.54]I'm ordering you to play it for Halloween, please.
[200:23.75]Is it the same game?
[200:25.61]Is it different?
[200:26.85]Or is it more of the same?
[200:29.45]Because I think I have like a full pretty much playthrough on the channel.
[200:35.13]I'm being commanded.
[200:38.89]Maybe I'll check it out.
[200:39.91]We'll see.
[200:42.46]There's a lot of things that could be played.
[200:45.74]We obviously have this.
[200:47.68]Single player is different.
[200:50.08]Is it really?
[200:51.24]It's way different.
[200:52.00]Okay.
[200:54.17]Oh, wow.
[200:54.51]Okay.
[200:55.45]Yeah.
[200:56.07]Maybe I'll give it a look.
[200:57.95]We don't have to play it for Halloween, but maybe I'll just play it some night just for fun.
[201:02.69]Why not?
[201:04.81]uh but thank you so much dude for the 50 and more so that that you're like up over 300 something dollars tonight only so thanks man that's a huge amount of money I'm just noticing this guy has
[201:20.97]This guy's head looks like the surface of Mars.
[201:22.95]Alright, let's go.
[201:23.37]I don't like this guy's voice.
[201:24.25]Single player is the same, but backwards.
[201:47.59]I'm gonna do Call of Cthulhu.
[201:48.89]There's a lot of games to get through, I know.
[201:50.63]But I'm into this.
[201:51.81]This game's cool.
[201:54.37]And survive I did.
[201:56.09]You did, did you?
[201:57.53]Well, I wasn't worried.
[201:59.76]So why did you need to find me?
[202:01.80]What did you need?
[202:02.82]I need... I seek a strange house of wares.
[202:06.90]Oh, nasty dude.
[202:08.28]Oh, never mind.
[202:10.49]the warehouse though I've been watching the place the sabat has a bunch of low-life humans working day and night to move stuff through there there's some major staging going on yeah this is like a really interesting game I'm very much enjoying it so far
[202:29.43]Secrets, sorrow, and sickness tell me of the Sabbath.
[202:32.23]Only the warm bloods infest the house of wares.
[202:34.17]Can you put me in the house?
[202:35.65]Can you put me in the house?
[202:36.93]Yes, I can.
[202:38.29]Just tell me when you're ready, and we'll leave.
[202:41.27]Once you're there, however, you're on your own.
[202:43.87]You'll have to get into the place and plant the explosives in the middle office to take the whole structure down.
[202:50.44]Gonna give a recap to the new viewers here.
[202:52.72]So, the recap...
[202:56.21]This is Vampire Fallout.
[202:57.87]There you go.
[203:00.20]It's Fallout... It's Fallout, like, two and a half.
[203:05.04]Vampire Edition.
[203:08.10]So far, is how I'm seeing it.
[203:10.50]But, it's very cool.
[203:13.91]Uh, my pockets... My pockets desire things they do not have.
[203:17.21]Light the way for me, your dude-ness.
[203:21.89]Um... Light the way.
[203:23.77]Let's go.
[203:28.14]The vampire may push its body to the peak of human prowess for a short time for a price in blood.
[203:31.48]Blood breath represents the vampire's innate ability to do that.
[203:33.66]Alright, so I'm inside now.
[203:35.90]I'm going to plant the explosives.
[203:41.81]Make sure this game is saved.
[203:49.07]Way in.
[203:51.17]It seems the answer to that question is yes.
[203:55.70]Guy pissing.
[204:01.16]How do I instant kill him?
[204:04.16]Is there an instant kill?
[204:07.90]Yes, there is.
[204:08.76]It's that.
[204:09.14]You just have to be behind them.
[204:19.45]Maybe I should go invisible.
[204:23.25]Drown him.
[204:30.22]Dresser?
[204:32.40]What the fuck am I... Oh, Jesus!
[204:35.00]Okay, there's people there.
[204:36.14]I don't want to make a lot of noise.
[204:39.51]I gotta put this down.
[204:45.19]Get off me.
[204:46.33]Move this way.
[204:47.41]Just move.
[204:52.72]Okay, I'm not gonna go in this door.
[204:54.24]I'm gonna sneak in here.
[204:55.08]Alright, who else is...
[205:01.19]It's just one guy.
[205:04.95]Oh.
[205:12.18]Alright.
[205:15.16]I guess that's how you do it.
[205:20.32]I wonder if I should go in that door then.
[205:36.55]There's one guy smoking a cigarette.
[205:42.55]How close do I have to be?
[205:43.37]Oh, there it is.
[205:47.36]I should be drinking this blood, but I'm not.
[205:53.54]It's pronounced Jyko EDM.
[205:57.94]Jyko EDM.
[205:59.60]Well, thanks a lot, Jyko.
[206:01.25]I'm gonna call you Jyko.
[206:04.41]Thanks for the extra $15.
[206:06.43]Thanks for the extra $15 and $50.
[206:10.14]Holy shit, dude.
[206:13.90]Jaiko has given... I think I have a problem.
[206:17.76]I've been waiting to catch a fucking stream for a year and a half now.
[206:20.48]All the time and energy I fucking spent waiting to be able to just donate and support your stream is built up to this.
[206:26.34]Keep it up.
[206:28.76]Save 50% or more with... Oh, boy.
[206:35.33]Uh, Jaiko is specced in finance.
[206:42.02]He's, he's, that, Jaiko, that is, that is a lot of money.
[206:49.68]You are, you are, you are really throwing down the stacks tonight.
[206:56.12]Thank you, dude.
[207:01.58]I'm glad you were able to catch a stream.
[207:06.24]That makes me happy that you're able to be here and see it.
[207:10.03]Don't feel obligated to spend, like, hundreds of dollars on me, though.
[207:14.73]Look, why would you want to give me that much money?
[207:16.75]I fucked it up.
[207:17.61]Janet died.
[207:20.65]Right, chat?
[207:24.21]Thanks a lot, man.
[207:25.07]Really.
[207:29.40]Still no shirt.
[207:30.34]Yeah, no shirt.
[207:30.94]What is this?
[207:33.00]12-gauge tube feed.
[207:35.87]Uh, okay.
[207:36.77]I'll take them all.
[207:45.96]Alright, get over here.
[207:49.12]Anything else?
[207:49.64]I think everybody's dead here.
[207:53.52]I believe so.
[207:55.78]You can't even remember her name.
[207:58.86]Wait, something in here.
[208:00.76]Why am I running like a fucking dickhead?
[208:01.96]There we go.
[208:02.42]38 ammo.
[208:06.12]Can't wait to sell all this shit.
[208:10.51]And I'm not going to use guns.
[208:20.23]RIP Jocelyn.
[208:22.41]We didn't mean to kill Jocelyn.
[208:26.37]It was an accident.
[208:29.07]So where am I supposed to be going?
[208:31.70]Probably around, right?
[208:36.31]Uh, maybe.
[208:37.11]We're down here.
[208:37.57]Where are they?
[208:40.59]What the fuck?
[208:41.26]What the fuck?
[208:41.80]What the fuck is different about tonight?
[208:43.42]Fuck.
[209:06.03]What the fuck?!

[209:36.36]Yeah, okay.
[209:37.30]There it is.
[209:37.76]Let's pick up your shit.
[209:40.57]Take the iron.
[209:43.17]We're good.
[209:46.25]What the fuck?
[209:47.11]Watch the fucking language.
[209:53.63]Frapsbackel, thanks for the $1.
[209:55.79]If I give you $1 for 50 streams, will you show me the same love as one time $50?
[210:00.17]Of course!
[210:07.50]Absolutely Everyone's get everyone gets treated equally here regardless of money not about the money Never was and it never will be Oh shit, I Really do like the going invisible thing
[210:36.40]It's great.
[210:37.38]I can't take myself seriously, though.
[210:42.55]Like, honest to God.
[210:46.07]I want to pick it up.
[210:46.73]What's that?
[210:47.06]Is it a screwdriver?
[210:49.26]What is on the ground here?
[210:50.98]Oh, I already have one.
[210:55.53]I look like a... What's his name there?
[210:58.39]Nothing personal.
[210:59.23]It's very clearly a pitch-shifted person.
[211:01.63]You fucking... What are you doing, you fucking idiot?
[211:03.89]Fucking explosives?
[211:05.21]Fuck you, fucking idiot.
[211:07.25]You fucking dummy.
[211:08.23]Climb on the trains.
[211:25.28]What's the name of that band?
[211:26.12]Sugar, um... They have that song that goes... I just wanna fly.
[211:35.59]Put your arms around me, baby.
[211:40.17]Wait, I already was up here.
[211:43.25]Whoops.
[211:51.80]Who are those fucking guys?
[211:54.14]Over here.
[212:04.12]I'm sitting here trying to think of Sugar Ray.
[212:09.62]I'm just walking into bullets.
[212:16.50]Hey.
[212:18.58]Now you see me, now you don't.
[212:27.40]Who is shooting me?
[212:28.46]What, he's still alive?
[212:29.98]Stop crouching!
[212:39.52]I just wanna fly Put your arms around me, baby Put your arms around me, baby This thing sucks
[213:07.59]Don't do it.
[213:08.87]He's gonna do it.
[213:10.29]Don't do it!
[213:14.75]Don't do it!
[213:18.71]Oh fuck, he missed.
[213:21.91]No, no more jokes.
[213:32.35]Why can I not hit this guy?
[213:42.61]Finally.
[213:43.05]And now we're going to obfuscate.
[213:47.84]Now we're going to confiscate this guy's weapons.
[213:52.48]Let's put on the tire iron again.
[213:54.08]No, the knife.
[213:55.48]Put the knife on.
[213:56.12]And bingo.
[213:58.38]What?
[214:13.97]He can't see me.
[214:23.69]Good, he can't... I just picked up like a garden hose.
[214:27.63]Good.
[214:31.93]I gotta drink this guy.
[214:36.80]Drink him!
[214:38.06]Get him!
[214:38.38]Got him.
[214:44.66]Just drink all of his blood.
[214:47.08]It's okay.
[214:49.76]He's all drained completely.
[214:51.08]And he's dead.
[214:53.20]We're good.
[214:55.98]Where is this guy shooting from?
[215:03.92]Someone can see me.
[215:06.32]Not anymore.
[215:11.74]Where'd he go?
[215:18.44]Turn it off.
[215:19.48]Holy shit, man.
[215:20.72]The way you stood up was not what I was expecting.
[215:24.89]Alright, now that we're good, let's just take it easy.
[215:34.49]Plant the explosives, and then we can get out of here.
[215:41.93]Success.
[215:48.88]I was under the assumption that that was going to be a... No, nobody was going to be standing there.
[216:03.13]Easy enough.
[216:06.14]Save it.
[216:09.18]Can I peek through the hole?
[216:10.34]Oh my lord.
[216:11.72]There's a lot of guys in here.
[216:19.44]I gotta think of a plan of action here.
[216:21.02]There's a lot of people in here.
[216:22.12]Plan of action.
[216:23.42]I have no plan.
[216:23.94]I have to leave.
[216:27.04]Fuck, he saw me open the door.
[216:30.74]What about the shot?
[216:31.65]Is the shotgun any good?
[216:33.45]I'm gonna try the shotgun.
[216:34.79]Just to try it.
[216:37.71]Pretty good.
[216:42.51]Shotgun's actually pretty great.
[216:47.09]Alright, we're gonna stealth shotgun this guy.
[216:49.90]No, no, no.
[216:50.86]We're gonna turn him.
[216:55.42]This shotgun is awful.
[216:58.52]What?
[216:58.68]Why?
[216:58.84]Sneaky shotgun.
[217:23.39]Come here!
[217:29.47]It's so much better this way.
[217:31.09]Why did I not pick guns?
[217:32.59]I should have picked guns.
[217:35.84]Point blank shotgun is a three hit kill.
[217:38.86]Let's do this.
[217:39.90]Where is anybody?
[217:41.56]Spider sense.
[217:47.72]Hysteria.
[217:55.29]Okay.
[217:57.59]Ah, his friend is getting drained.
[217:59.07]Oh, I'm out of bullets.
[218:04.09]Am I completely out of bullets?
[218:08.82]Yes, I am.
[218:10.50]What does this do?
[218:15.90]Why am I moving this?
[218:18.35]Oh, I could have killed somebody with that.
[218:22.41]Well, that's good to know.
[218:34.34]Okay.
[218:35.50]Going back to the knife.
[218:43.07]Let's hallucinate this guy.
[218:46.89]I just gave him a speed buff.
[218:50.81]That's all I did.
[218:54.89]I gave that guy extra attack speed by doing this.
[219:01.43]Throw the knife?
[219:02.31]How do you throw the knife?
[219:07.69]Blood buff.
[219:08.60]That's all I have.
[219:14.36]What's in here?
[219:15.80]12 gauge.
[219:16.10]Take it.
[219:18.64]Oh, this guy is defenseless.
[219:24.80]Easy for me to do.
[219:28.27]Just take it, take it, take it, take it, take it.
[219:30.53]And then... Don't let him out alive.
[219:39.69]Sabotage this?
[219:40.71]No.
[219:42.33]Okay, I think I'm gonna keep moving.
[219:46.79]Shotgun ammo, that's good.
[219:49.65]Oh.
[219:55.22]Oh.
[219:57.89]They heard that.
[220:01.81]They heard that.
[220:09.46]They don't carry enough to investigate, though.
[220:12.28]Oddly enough.
[220:19.28]There's a lot of bullets I'm taking.
[220:22.46]Back to the shotgun?
[220:23.64]I think so.
[220:24.04]I like the shotgun.
[220:24.60]It's fun to shoot those guys.
[220:32.54]No, they're too dumb to get to me.
[220:33.76]I'll be alright.
[220:42.23]Take it all.
[220:44.19]Take every piece of bullet tree.
[220:53.86]Whoa, that... What was that?
[220:57.26]Ah, it's probably nothing.
[221:04.21]He didn't see me.
[221:04.91]Can I stealth shoot him?
[221:22.19]Hide in the dumpster?
[221:27.43]The ragdolls are perfect.
[221:29.31]They are so good.
[221:31.97]Were those the explosives I needed to deal with or what?
[221:40.42]Alright, my health is alright.
[221:44.86]I see a gas can over there.
[221:46.36]I've been playing this for over three hours and I still have not put a shirt on.
[221:58.63]That is an extraordinarily true statement.
[222:05.41]Here's gas.
[222:11.08]Okay.
[222:14.98]What does it want me to do?
[222:29.23]I can't pick that up?
[222:41.74]Okay.
[222:46.07]Just makes the thing collapse.
[222:49.11]Shit, I can't open it.
[222:50.79]I guess I have to go up there.
[222:58.89]Why can I not get up here?
[223:06.14]What was the point of doing this?
[223:10.80]Oh well.
[223:39.66]I'm here!
[223:40.38]Just in case you wanted to know!
[223:43.16]He can't see me.
[224:01.51]I just made him crazy.
[224:04.91]What does that do?
[224:07.08]He's just making like gorilla noises.
[224:19.44]Alright.
[224:20.38]Well, I got him.
[224:27.32]Hey!
[224:36.42]Damn it!
[224:37.18]Oh, I so badly wanted him to... Whoa!
[224:47.75]Watch it!
[224:48.55]Watch it!
[224:58.56]It's like a Kung Fu movie.
[225:04.52]That guy just did... Okay, you know in the Power Rangers when like... Jason... Does like a spin kick to one of the putties?
[225:12.63]That's what he just did.
[225:20.31]I think I'm good to go.
[225:22.17]I believe I am.
[225:24.37]I need to drink somebody though.
[225:27.02]Can I climb this?
[225:29.15]No, of course not.
[225:30.17]I think that was all the guys that were hanging out over here.
[225:41.75]Yeah.
[225:42.23]There's no way anyone's even still here.
[225:43.45]Like, four guys just ran in here.
[225:49.40]Do you open?
[225:50.20]Yes, you do.
[225:54.28]Locked.
[225:55.94]Bullshit.
[226:05.82]What am I actually supposed to be accomplishing here?
[226:09.18]I have to go plant explosives or something, right?
[226:13.70]I keep hearing a train approaching, but there's no train.
[226:17.35]I was already out here.
[226:18.09]This is back where I was before.
[226:19.67]Did I walk in a circle?
[226:28.19]Apparently.
[226:30.69]Apparently.
[226:35.36]There's some stairs.
[226:38.18]Oh shit, there's a guy here.
[226:50.35]Shoot him!
[226:56.24]Well, we're here.
[226:57.04]Anything else?
[227:05.81]No, nothing else.
[227:07.99]Good to know.
[227:08.59]We can climb this.
[227:13.63]Alright, who needs blood?
[227:16.33]There's an item over here.
[227:21.97]What is it?
[227:23.43]Silver ring.
[227:26.14]Nice.
[227:27.80]Can this be opened?
[227:28.86]It can.
[227:31.86]I don't trust myself here, so...
[227:37.77]Jesus.
[227:40.39]Hey, note to self, guys, don't ever run like this on the board that's this tiny.
[227:46.46]A beam that's this small.
[227:51.32]I'm playing with fire here.
[227:55.82]This is where I knocked that thing over.
[227:59.57]Okay.
[228:03.33]This is locked.
[228:05.79]Thanks for the advice, Dad.
[228:15.75]Succeeded.
[228:17.97]I blood buffed.
[228:27.54]I wouldn't open that door if I were you, man.
[228:34.30]Open it.
[228:34.60]No, if I'm gonna open it, you have to move out of the way.
[228:38.90]I gotta drink this guy.
[228:50.65]Take it all.
[228:54.01]Or at least most of it.
[228:54.87]Okay.
[228:59.83]Coffee machine.
[229:00.81]Lots of random items in here.
[229:02.19]Ooh, I got the explosives.
[229:05.23]That's what I needed, right?
[229:07.13]No, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[229:08.53]Dude, hold on.
[229:09.85]Hold on a second.
[229:10.37]Don't do it yet.
[229:11.73]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[229:13.43]Um, how did... Oh, God.
[229:18.21]Oh, God.
[229:18.59]I have three minutes to get out of here.
[229:20.00]Get out.
[229:24.66]Out?
[229:25.54]Where's the out?
[229:26.34]Out?
[229:29.20]How do I get out?
[229:29.76]I think it's this way.
[229:30.40]No, it's not.
[229:32.40]It's over here.
[229:33.64]Can this open?
[229:35.08]That doesn't open.
[229:35.86]Where's the exit?
[229:37.32]Over here.
[229:43.40]Out.
[229:48.08]Wait, what was that?
[229:49.30]What?
[229:50.40]Who is this guy?
[229:52.86]What the fuck are you?
[229:55.47]Where's my gun?
[230:00.83]Somebody just got torn apart.
[230:02.63]Hallucinate him.
[230:03.21]I can't.
[230:04.12]Honestly, I need a weapon.
[230:05.98]Weapon, please.
[230:07.08]Where's my weapon?
[230:12.82]I can't shoot my shotgun.
[230:15.46]Bullets are falling out of my body.
[230:16.84]Do you see this?
[230:19.48]I can't shoot him.
[230:20.74]No, don't.
[230:21.25]Huh?
[230:34.67]I got an idea.
[230:38.06]Where'd he go?
[230:39.20]He's invisible?
[230:40.10]I can do that too.
[230:41.56]He's right there.
[230:42.88]Watch this.
[230:43.18]Didn't get him.
[230:45.36]I'm just gonna run.
[230:49.12]Where do I run to?
[230:50.66]I don't remember.
[230:51.24]This guy's fucking scaring the shit out of me.
[230:54.96]Get me out of here.
[231:01.03]Um...
[231:08.98]I don't know where the fuck I'm going.
[231:11.78]I don't know where I am.
[231:15.52]Oh, look.
[231:16.02]Shotgun bullets.
[231:20.19]Go.
[231:21.41]Go, go!
[231:23.59]Stop crouching.
[231:24.27]Get up from the crouch.
[231:28.37]It's over here somewhere.
[231:33.82]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[231:34.68]Keep going.
[231:39.38]Yep.
[231:39.78]Alright.
[231:40.06]Keep going.
[231:40.44]I'm almost there.
[231:46.35]Okay.
[231:46.77]We're safe.
[231:51.57]Still chasing me.
[231:52.37]This is that guy, right?
[232:01.17]The warehouse.
[232:02.81]Your handiwork, I presume.
[232:07.75]It wasn't me.
[232:08.19]It was my evil twin.
[232:09.41]Didn't you see the goatee?
[232:11.35]Explosions always remind me of my childhood.
[232:13.35]I like to blow things up.
[232:14.29]Have you ever been exploded?
[232:15.48]Ah, werewolf.
[232:22.48]Explosions always remind me of my childhood.
[232:30.48]Are you the big bad wolf, friend, foe, duck, duck, or goose?
[232:34.24]You werewolf.
[232:35.32]You werewolf.
[232:38.48]Not experienced much in the creatures of the night, are you?
[232:42.61]For future reference, you might keep in mind that werewolves aren't in the habit of introducing themselves.
[232:49.61]Except me.
[232:51.13]Like I just did to you.
[232:54.21]No final death for me?
[232:55.55]I hadn't planned on it.
[232:58.82]Are you the big bad wolf?
[233:00.06]I see my reputation for once.
[233:02.49]Does not precede me.
[233:04.67]My name is Beckett.
[233:06.47]I haven't been following you per se.
[233:09.11]We've just coincidentally been at the same places at the same time.
[233:13.14]For different reasons.
[233:14.96]So sorry if I unnerved you.
[233:17.98]Tell me, have you by chance seen or felt anything strange since your embrace?
[233:25.11]I see dead people.
[233:26.49]Now, that was a relevant joke back in the day.
[233:28.90]I'll let that one slide.
[233:30.76]The Baron's sister is herself.
[233:32.14]Two minds, one face.
[233:34.71]Something to look forward to, eh?
[233:36.01]I'll tell him that.
[233:38.83]I guess I see dead people.
[233:39.97]This guy looks trustworthy.
[233:42.07]That's all I care to tell you.
[233:57.02]like a sense of dread or pressure.
[234:00.25]But I'm not a native to these parts, so I can't tell if it's irregular.
[234:05.65]And since you're still fresh, perhaps you're not attuned to it.
[234:11.69]pleasure meeting your acquaintance but there are rumblings for me to discredit we shall I'm certain meet again never again okay or never again good night young one and be careful you're very likely being hunted by the sabbat by the sabbat okay goodbye wolf goodbye nice talking to you okay it was a automatic
[234:45.02]Is it never not nighttime in this game?
[234:48.34]That's a good question.
[234:49.34]Alright, well, I'm back here.
[234:50.42]Hi.
[234:51.24]Nice work, fledgling.
[234:52.90]I felt that explosion a mile away.
[234:55.47]It's all over the news, too.
[234:57.39]Man, there's going to be some pissed-off Sabbat just howling for blood tonight.
[235:03.47]Alright, well, if they ever do a Vampire the Masquerade's Bloodlines movie, Kevin Bacon better be this guy.
[235:14.03]Just the way it is.
[235:16.00]Do you know Beckett?
[235:17.30]Beckett?
[235:18.22]Well, I know of him.
[235:19.38]Why?
[235:22.41]The Dark Voices told me he was near, but we traded words.
[235:25.51]No kidding.
[235:28.01]Must be something major happening if he's in town.
[235:30.73]Beckett is a historian of sorts.
[235:33.24]He's unearthed more vampire lore than anyone.
[235:35.24]Well, that's all Beckett does.
[235:37.78]Seek the truth behind our condition.
[235:40.54]Mm-hmm.
[235:42.00]I seek to pull questions from your bubbling dome.
[235:44.18]You are truly nasty-licious.
[235:47.50]What do you need?
[235:49.69]Do you see the shadow-cloaked killer?
[235:51.41]Was the war with Janice's daughter burning everyone's lips?
[235:54.75]I seek to pull questions from your bubbling nothing.
[235:57.59]Do you see the shadow-cloaked killer?
[235:58.83]Those murders are definitely the work of Kindred.
[236:01.04]Probably some cate of getting revenge on everyone who made fun of him in high school.
[236:05.18]Once the sheriff tracks this guy down, they're going to make one hell of an example of him.
[236:09.66]Nasty-licious.
[236:14.62]Kate if the motherless dogs pretty close to the mark the mother that was me being in vampires who don't know anything about vampire society don't know their clan mutt vampires what I suspect you were perilously close to becoming if LaCroix hadn't intervened can you open my eyes yeah
[236:39.70]Clue me in on the secrets.
[236:42.22]Tell me of the Sabbat.
[236:43.14]I want to know about this.
[236:43.90]Bethesda.
[236:44.16]Okay.
[236:44.36]Bye.
[236:44.54]So, what do we got?
[237:10.67]So we go to report to Prince Lacroix at the Venture Tower downtown.
[237:15.85]We have to go downtown.
[237:16.71]There's still these things too.
[237:23.34]Medicine.
[237:24.64]I want to go get the campaign killer.
[237:30.40]Because that I feel like is in my best interest.
[237:35.06]I need clothes too.
[237:36.36]Do I have enough to level up?
[237:39.62]Okay, let's do... Could do another point in stealth.
[237:48.72]Perception.
[237:53.60]Ranged combat.
[237:55.52]How is that any different than, like, a firearm?
[237:57.26]Is that just what it is?
[238:01.20]Strength.
[238:04.48]Could do another point in strength.
[238:13.02]Deceit, Brawl, Melee, Stealth.
[238:23.18]Do Dex again.
[238:24.16]No, no Dex right now.
[238:25.42]Scholarship, Investigation, Computer, Finance.
[238:30.20]How do you gain humanity?
[238:33.32]What does this do now?
[238:46.19]I can stealth kill while invisible.
[238:49.51]Well, I'm going to do sneak.
[238:51.15]We'll put one into stealth.
[238:54.41]It just makes it easier to sneak around.
[238:57.71]I can do another one here.
[239:00.71]Or I can do one into melee.
[239:02.37]Another one into melee.
[239:05.51]Strength.
[239:09.65]This is unarmed, though.
[239:10.89]Let's do...
[239:15.46]How many points does that give me?
[239:18.08]How many points?
[239:19.26]Is it four?
[239:24.73]Just do some co-op and get some humanity.
[239:27.61]I'm okay with that.
[239:28.27]That's good for now.
[239:29.97]Stealth and a melee.
[239:30.85]I'll put one point of strength that I need to.
[239:34.41]Computer.
[239:36.43]It's only three.
[239:37.17]I'll get there in a minute.
[239:37.87]I'll do computer next.
[239:44.15]Oh, you actually can spend a point to get humanity?
[239:51.49]Can I?
[239:51.81]10 points!
[239:58.12]Okay.
[239:59.44]Let's go.
[240:01.84]I'm getting hungry.
[240:05.64]I do like this game a lot, though.
[240:06.68]This game's very fun.
[240:08.48]It's very interesting.
[240:10.34]The combat and the mechanics are a little off and a little odd.
[240:14.08]But just the video game itself.
[240:17.04]It's an interesting place.
[240:20.24]I am enjoying it.
[240:24.47]Well, this guy is guaranteed to die.
[240:27.67]Just wait for the one guy that always comes back here to pee and to drain his blood.
[240:30.85]Anybody see this?
[240:39.95]I don't think so.
[240:40.43]Alright, so how do I get downtown?
[240:46.12]Is there a map?
[240:50.78]There's the blood bank.
[240:51.58]I need to sell some shit.
[240:52.96]Let's sell and buy clothes.
[240:57.33]Take her to the pawn shop.
[241:03.05]There's the art gallery.
[241:04.17]There's the hospital.
[241:05.51]There's the pawn shop.
[241:07.63]It was the other side, right?
[241:08.79]Yeah.
[241:13.06]Take a taxi.
[241:14.68]Do you actually have to take a taxi?
[241:18.74]Interesting if you do.
[241:24.38]Here's the diner.
[241:26.56]Where's the pawn shop?
[241:34.06]Oh, you actually have to take a taxi.
[241:39.20]Get this big yellow beetle scuttling towards my destiny.
[241:44.63]Oh, Jesus.
[241:45.25]Okay.
[241:46.15]Downtown.
[241:49.72]That's funny.
[241:50.14]I thought you guys were just pulling my chain there.
[241:52.76]What is this?
[241:57.05]Uh...
[242:03.58]That was the guy with the cartoon baseball bat.
[242:06.20]That was the guy.
[242:06.82]Oh, God.
[242:07.24]Oh, shit.
[242:07.80]Ah!
[242:25.34]I'm gonna get rescued by the guy.
[242:28.16]Snape is gonna come rescue me.

[242:31.41]There he is.
[242:33.21]Standing right there.
[242:34.21]Top right.
[242:36.49]There he is.
[242:37.83]Slow.
[242:38.03]He has a gun out.
[242:38.81]He's holding a gun.
[242:39.61]Son of a bitch!
[242:54.54]Nope, it's another guy.
[242:56.34]Uh-oh.
[242:56.48]Oh shit, he's chaotic evil.
[243:16.13]Keep moving.
[243:16.51]It's just the wolf among us and his fairy tale friends.
[243:21.77]Huh?
[243:22.69]Very clearly could have got him.
[243:47.02]I was about to destroy them.

[245:22.86]Apartments.
[245:26.12]Get away from my stuff.
[245:26.96]What are you talking about?
[245:31.86]This is the... This is odd.
[245:35.94]That's definitely a vampire house.
[245:38.02]Without a question.
[245:48.90]Interesting scenery.
[245:49.70]I like it.
[245:52.84]Um... Parking.

[246:27.44]Oh, man, you been feeding on that rock, kid?
[246:30.11]Nah, nah, nah, brother.
[246:31.67]I don't sell none of that no more.
[246:35.09]Got some crazy eyes on you.
[246:37.48]Believe me, I don't have to see the freeze-dried ice cream to know a space cadet when I see one.
[246:45.78]But I have so many loot cakes to fatten you.
[246:48.86]Fine, no feast of Ben Franklin's for the fat man tonight.
[246:52.16]I feel like a stone in a sinners store.
[246:53.84]Oh boy.
[246:54.62]Alright, what do you got?
[246:56.24]This is what I got here.

[247:19.08]There goes all my money, it's all gone

[247:37.21]Alright, take my life.
[247:38.51]What about this ring?
[247:39.53]Go to North Bree Tech... Okay, I'm not gonna sell that.

[248:51.19]When you pick up the flower.
[248:52.11]No, this is like the swim gear for Mario.
[248:57.46]Now I can sell the other ones.
[248:59.40]Fucking, like, janitor clothing.
[249:05.84]I was gonna make, like, a Mario joke, but, like, I just couldn't do it because I was, like, he was just talking in my ear and I couldn't even speak.
[249:13.42]I had, like, I had, like, a lined up, like, Mario joke there and I just, I couldn't do it.
[249:17.40]There was a guy talking in my ear.
[249:19.44]Impossible.
[249:22.10]I can't sell these.
[249:23.74]Why?

[249:54.27]Check it out!
[249:54.95]Step right up!
[249:56.71]These clothes- I hate these clothes.
[249:59.78]These are awful.
[250:02.26]It's like visceral clean-up detail.
[250:04.52]Except not.
[250:07.69]And now where am I gonna go?
[250:08.83]Uh, downtown.
[250:09.41]Uh, wasn't there a- Did I have to go to somebody's house?
[250:22.11]Prince Lacroix at the Venture Tower downtown.
[250:29.12]Time to find the Venture Tower.
[250:31.18]Should be fun.
[250:43.44]Mom dressed me well this morning.
[250:45.66]Hollowbrook Hotel.
[250:51.77]What was that?
[250:52.57]What is going on?
[250:53.23]Somebody's shooting me with a gun.
[250:56.57]Somebody just shot me in the head.
[251:00.94]I'm not crazy, right?
[251:02.86]Somebody just got shot in the head.
[251:04.28]Who?
[251:04.72]Was it me?
[251:08.10]Huh?
[251:12.28]Is it the guy that's ice skating?
[251:23.51]Where are you guys running from?
[251:24.41]What is this?
[251:38.36]It's this guy.
[251:45.02]Let's follow him, see if he gets arrested.
[251:53.63]Wait, it's two separate gangs?
[251:56.49]Wait, now they're being chased.
[252:02.14]Now they're chasing them.
[252:04.08]The hazmat suits now got involved.
[252:06.78]Now they're running away from nothing.
[252:08.54]They're chasing the guy that they originally were chasing.
[252:19.15]This is a fucking madhouse.
[252:27.91]Look, this is your series of events here.
[252:30.60]This guy's going way faster.
[252:34.06]He's so much faster.
[252:35.26]Almost got him with the karate kick.
[252:36.46]Almost.
[252:36.76]If you hit me, there's going to be a problem.
[252:42.14]If you hit me, there's going to be a big fucking problem.
[252:47.16]Okay, well, nice work.
[252:53.61]I don't think so.
[252:58.35]Male.
[253:00.25]What?
[253:00.45]They're like the greasers.
[253:03.33]They have like fucking leather jackets on and they're like the leather gang?
[253:12.78]Is this fucking grease?
[253:17.89]Nobody talks to you.
[253:18.65]Okay, well whatever.
[253:19.39]I'm done.
[253:30.57]I'm done with that.
[253:31.47]We need to find the tower.
[253:37.20]Wait a minute.
[253:38.56]This guy already got replaced.
[253:41.46]Interesting.
[253:42.10]Okay.
[253:47.72]I'm just trying to listen to your conversation.
[253:52.60]You got a problem with that?
[253:54.98]Is this a big tower?
[253:55.80]This looks like a big tower.
[254:02.10]I haven't checked my mail.
[254:03.28]I have to go back to my house all the way back?
[254:06.76]Here we go.
[254:07.42]We're here.
[254:08.68]You look familiar, Chief.
[254:11.68]We haven't met before, have we?
[254:13.43]Oh, yeah.
[254:14.33]Back in Santa Monica, right?
[254:17.17]Just same security guard.
[254:19.09]Now I got this sweet night shift position and I'm happier than the time I met Superwoods.
[254:23.89]Ah, well, enough about my luck.
[254:25.59]This is depressing.
[254:26.53]You here to see one of the bigwigs, Chief?
[254:30.76]Send me to the top of the ivory tower quickly.
[254:32.74]Yeah, I'm going to be able to get in this guy's head and make him hate himself again.
[254:39.06]Open the Sky Ferry.
[254:56.46]Mm-hmm.
[254:56.64]May the fat of many creatures fill your belly.
[254:58.16]Oh, that like... What are you a chunk of?
[254:59.22]Is there a bigger piece?
[255:25.78]That's terrible.
[255:26.82]I will stitch your name in my brain.
[255:28.18]Farewell.
[255:29.30]Any cameras in here?
[255:58.91]Wait, what is that?
[256:01.03]Get your hands off that.
[256:03.73]Oops.
[256:04.65]What did I just do?
[256:07.41]I just, like, flicked a light switch.
[256:11.15]Why is it giving me a light switch?
[256:16.78]Oh, it's this.
[256:17.40]Okay.
[256:18.90]Should I drain him?
[256:22.22]I can't.
[256:23.58]Get your hands off that.
[256:29.16]Weapons are not allowed.
[256:29.94]Do I have to go through the metal detector?
[256:31.72]It's going to beep, right?
[256:35.02]Well, these metal detectors don't work.
[256:38.22]Not secure at all.
[256:44.62]This one don't work.
[256:46.34]Neither does this one.
[256:47.20]What about... Ah, we got the right one.
[256:51.54]PH.
[256:53.23]The penthouse.
[256:54.07]Whoa.
[256:54.31]Whoa.
[256:57.33]That's the Resident Evil fucking 5 guy.
[257:00.97]No, Resident Evil 4?
[257:02.79]That's the little guy that has, like, the two huge dudes.
[257:05.78]One chases you around in the sewer.
[257:08.08]I just want to say that Mr. Kennedy... What's his name?
[257:12.86]He stresses Napoleon.
[257:19.26]Resident Evil 4.
[257:20.04]There it is.
[257:31.17]He's trying to, like, slit his bodyguard's throat.
[257:33.29]Yes.
[257:35.25]Done.
[257:35.39]Boom.
[257:35.51]I met a Snattercat.
[257:59.30]Bloody Mercury, Two Faces, Diner Assassins, Wolf People.
[258:04.78]There were no explosives on Mercury, but I found some.
[258:07.44]I'm going to go with the first one.
[258:09.56]Yes, yes.
[258:11.38]I'm sure it was quite an experience.
[258:14.58]You've done well, circumstances being what they were.
[258:17.06]I will admit, not many in your position would have overcome such a trial.
[258:23.37]There we go.
[258:23.69]Didn't even happen to kill a red spy earlier.
[258:42.44]What shall I spy with my little eyes?
[258:43.97]When you say jump, I say, where's the cliff?
[258:46.57]Dangle something in front of me.
[258:47.95]Don't be so hasty to inflate your own worth.
[258:50.45]You've succeeded once.
[258:51.73]Very admirable.
[258:53.17]But in the grand scheme of it all, an infant stride of progress.
[258:57.71]If you're looking to make a name for yourself, listen very carefully.
[259:01.55]What if I don't want to make a name for myself?
[259:04.26]What if I just want to be a regular citizen?
[259:06.34]Concerning the Elizabeth Dane, the cargo ship that was towed into port recently.
[259:11.55]Have you heard of it?
[259:13.27]Uh... I ignored those whispers.
[259:17.02]Tell me more.
[259:17.40]The Dane was found out at sea.
[259:19.72]The reports say it was without crew, but they have yet to report a fate of said crew.
[259:25.44]Hmm.
[259:25.54]Hmm.
[259:47.44]And more importantly, I need evidence that the occurrences on the Dane were not supernatural in nature.
[259:53.34]And in no way relate to this Ankaran sarcophagus.
[260:01.59]Why this one?
[260:02.35]Should I repeat myself?
[260:04.23]I do believe I mentioned the fact that I bent the delicate laws that govern our society to allow you a chance to live.
[260:11.71]If that isn't enough, I can't give you another reason.
[260:19.04]Help me understand.
[260:21.28]One.
[260:22.18]I want you to examine the sarcophagus for anything unusual.
[260:25.36]Open up the sarcophagus and breathe in whatever comes out.
[260:28.47]Got it.
[260:29.47]In fact, many kindred in this city have reported an uneasiness in the air since the Danes' arrival.
[260:35.91]Do not, under any circumstances, open the Uncoran sarcophagus.
[260:40.30]Okay.
[260:40.58]Alright.
[260:41.24]Understood.
[261:06.54]So what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to this ancient relic and I'm going to grab a hold of it.
[261:11.72]I'm going to say out loud, I'm going to say, fuck you, fuck you.
[261:15.54]I curse the person that's in here, you piece of shit.
[261:18.14]You are worthless.
[261:19.79]You deserve to be in here.
[261:21.47]And I'm going to spit on it, open it, and just breathe in.
[261:24.31]Let's see what happens.
[261:29.23]Got it.
[261:29.91]Good.
[261:30.52]What do I have to tell him?
[261:50.29]He wants me to find the last round in this field of massive rectangles.
[261:54.21]I see.
[261:54.89]What?
[261:55.55]Then, you should go humor the by-the-numbers rhetoric he's so desperately aching to spew.
[262:01.16]I wonder why I chose Valkovian for you.
[262:03.02]Me too.
[262:03.34]I love humoring.
[262:04.98]I'm there.
[262:05.60]Give the Anarch community my regards.
[262:16.69]He he good one What about you do you talk No, you don't Alright, so what can I take from this guy's apart is this like his apartment his office Alright, just just a complete and total observation here This place is this is a this is way too big for your office.
[262:42.31]Oh
[262:43.74]The door... The wall should be here.
[262:46.58]And the door should be there.
[262:48.62]Put that desk against that wall, facing this way.
[262:54.42]This doesn't need to exist.
[262:55.57]You have too much shit.
[262:58.47]You know when you play The Sims?
[263:00.13]This is what I would do.
[263:01.55]When I play The Sims and I make my house...
[263:04.25]You get into that point where you make the gigantic fucking room and then you have to start to make walls and sometimes you just say fuck it and you put your kitchen and your living room and your living room and your bedroom and your bedroom and your bathroom
[263:15.00]And you just put toilets in random places, you just put couches, it doesn't fucking matter.
[263:18.00]This is what- this is looking down in somebody's like Sims house that didn't care to put up any walls.
[263:24.00]That's what it looks like.
[263:28.00]It's just dump it all everywhere who cares and like there should be a toilet right there.
[263:35.12]Like the bed would be sticking in that corner.
[263:42.46]Open concept.
[263:44.21]You don't put... What do you mean don't put toilets in random places?
[263:47.66]Yeah, you go right on up and see Mr. LaCroix.
[263:50.08]Let's see what we got on good old camera three.
[263:53.03]Oh, well, hello there.
[263:54.41]I want to see.
[263:55.15]Show me.
[263:55.37]I've been thinking about you.
[263:56.93]Oh, yeah.
[263:58.03]I want to lick you all over.
[264:00.97]Then make my way down to your creamy center and what the... Get your hands off my Bavarian cream.
[264:11.13]Who are you looking at?
[264:11.71]Is this guy talking about the pillars or the signs?
[264:16.38]I don't know.
[264:18.99]That was a little creepy.
[264:20.91]Creepy.
[264:22.35]Let's go.
[264:23.77]So we need to go to the prince.
[264:25.01]Wants you to investigate the Elizabeth Dane.
[264:26.27]But before you do, he wants you to contact Nines Rodriguez at the bar.
[264:29.77]Call the last round.
[264:30.73]I want to go back to the hospital.
[264:34.97]There's a girl in there.
[264:35.69]I want to go.
[264:36.05]I don't want to do this yet.
[264:40.03]Fuck Salazar San.
[264:41.08]I want to go do something else.
[264:47.54]Oh, fuck.

[264:56.04]Santa Monica, go.
[265:05.22]Shit.
[265:05.81]What happens?
[265:06.55]What happens if you get caught?
[265:07.25]Do I have to do something?
[265:10.75]What happens if I get caught?
[265:18.41]You're doing a real good job sneaking.
[265:23.26]Now he has a gun out.
[265:27.50]You won't shoot this person.
[265:28.72]I know you won't.
[265:33.04]I was wrong.
[265:34.34]I was just wrong.
[265:42.26]What happened?
[265:42.76]What do I do about this?
[265:43.73]I didn't save the game!
[265:45.83]I gotta get- I gotta get safe.
[265:46.71]I gotta get safe.
[265:47.19]Safe, safe, safe, safe, safe.
[265:48.07]Somewhere safe.
[265:49.43]Somewhere safe.
[265:51.21]And I gotta hide.
[265:52.31]Right here.
[265:56.20]Huh?
[266:10.25]What do I do?
[266:18.41]Do I have like a... Jafar!
[266:30.02]Get the lamp, Jafar!
[266:33.63]Gilbert Gottfried!
[266:34.77]Like, nobody can do a Gilbert Gottfried except for Gilbert Gottfried.
[266:52.69]I can do Gilbert Gottfried.
[266:53.67]No, you can't.
[266:57.27]I'm going to try as hard as I can to do Gilbert Gottfried right now.
[266:59.47]I'm going to try as fucking hard as I can.
[267:03.31]I have to stand back for this.
[267:06.30]Okay.
[267:09.38]It's going to be loud.
[267:10.50]You can't do Gilbert Gottfried soft.
[267:11.82]You have to do it really loud.
[267:12.72]No, you can't.
[267:21.97]I... I... Nope.
[267:24.33]You have to scream to do Gilbert Godfrey.
[267:28.47]One last try.
[267:31.29]Hey, let me tell you something, Jafar!
[267:36.11]Nope.
[267:39.64]Good luck.
[267:40.62]Now you try.
[267:41.12]Thank you, Greg.
[267:45.86]Hey there, what can I do you for?
[267:49.92]Hey, tell me the tales of your hunting.
[267:51.78]What do you want to know?
[267:52.60]It just sounds like you screaming.
[267:59.31]It's just a scream.
[268:00.87]That's Gilbert.
[268:01.55]Look, listen.
[268:08.49]Hold on.
[268:09.95]Hold tight.
[268:10.29]Caller, you're whiling away the evening with the dead of night.
[268:19.44]We're going to pull up an audio.
[268:21.16]I'm going to try to do it.
[268:25.69]Okay, Gilbert Godfrey.
[268:26.79]Here it is.
[268:28.45]This is Gilbert Godfrey.
[268:30.07]It reads Fifty Shades of Grey, apparently.
[268:36.41]Let's see.
[268:39.07]No, this is an ad I just gave them.
[268:40.75]Hold on.
[268:41.11]It's not even him doing it.
[268:47.90]See?
[268:48.12]No, this is not... No, we gotta get that parrot.
[268:51.46]Hold on.
[268:52.16]What's the parrot's name?
[268:53.76]What's the fucking parrot's name?
[268:58.72]Iago.
[268:59.88]Here.
[269:16.34]This is back when Gilbert Gottfried wasn't like 80.
[269:21.87]No.
[269:22.83]This is a video I don't... This is not the right video.
[269:25.67]Not the right one.
[269:26.41]Some of these are probably like fucking offensive meme videos.
[269:32.91]There we go.
[269:56.39]You get the idea, okay?
[269:59.79]You understand.
[270:00.37]I got somewhere to be.
[270:02.91]Never mind.
[270:03.29]Bye.
[270:07.99]I just wanna tell ya!
[270:13.99]Yeah, who knows?
[270:14.87]Anytime you look up a random YouTube video from 10 years ago, it could be anything.
[270:20.86]That's back in like the 160p, like the 140... I thought that... I just thought it was... I thought it was still playing.
[270:29.08]It really is Gilbert Gottfried.
[270:42.87]Didn't I kill this guy?
[270:49.38]Nevermind.
[270:55.56]144p, yeah.
[270:57.08]Back in the day.
[271:00.26]Does he actually have a quest?
[271:02.14]Because I can't talk to him.
[271:03.58]No, I can't talk to him.
[271:05.56]Alright, let's go.
[271:08.11]She types like you.
[271:09.25]Yeah, she does.
[271:17.41]Alright.
[271:19.49]How do we heal this?
[271:21.51]I still have to give pain medication to that guy that's been dying for like four hours on the couch.
[271:36.21]Return of Jafar.
[271:39.33]Is anything even back here?
[271:42.19]Not really.
[271:54.06]I need to go to the club?
[271:54.96]Alright, let's do that first.
[272:02.95]I want that fire axe.
[272:10.82]Into the asylum we go.
[272:14.69]Hello.
[272:19.57]I gotta check my emails, too.
[272:21.42]That's true.
[272:23.72]Alright, you.
[272:26.54]I seek the Vault of Gold.
[272:27.50]Have you seen the Golden Hunter?
[272:28.84]Only for the voices to stop serenading me.
[272:30.76]Have you seen the Golden Hunter?
[272:33.71]That wasn't me.
[272:35.79]It was one of the other voices in my head.
[272:37.21]The density of your grey matter is flabbergasting.
[272:42.33]You're crazier than who I see in the mirror.
[272:51.33]How did you see my bloody little secret?
[272:54.83]It's like a vampire fanboy.
[273:04.15]Are you also a knight's child?
[273:13.13]I'm a ghoul.
[273:13.75]I didn't know about any of this stuff until a couple of months ago.
[273:19.36]Yeah, ghoulish is a ghoulish.
[273:30.59]Wait, what's a ghoul?
[273:31.21]Well, the way it was explained to me, whenever a vampire lets a human drink some of their vampire blood, the human gains a little vampire power.
[273:42.16]So yeah, ghoul is, I don't know what a ghoul is.
[273:47.18]I've read the lore.
[273:50.35]Are you a happy little golden ghoul?
[273:52.07]Who is this nasty dude?
[273:53.13]Oh, you like put your mouth on his arm?
[274:17.42]This music.
[274:18.36]This is some real 90s music, 90s grunge.
[274:20.85]It's not grunge.
[274:22.19]A light feeder from across the narrow sea.
[274:36.33]90's vampire movie music.
[274:39.17]Grunge music.
[274:39.61]Yeah, I was not even close.
[274:41.27]Doesn't look like me, this looks like the guy from Phantasmagoria from last night, without the glasses.
[275:02.05]Alright, so... Truth to your words be made.
[275:12.72]What?
[275:13.74]How did you know?
[275:17.28]Uh, look.
[275:19.84]I don't know what you're talking about.
[275:21.90]This guy's crazy.
[275:22.74]I can't tell you anything, huh?
[275:24.50]I mean, you're not being straight with me.
[275:27.76]But I've... Ah!
[275:29.25]Okay, okay, okay.
[275:30.61]Damn it.
[275:32.71]Looks like second life.
[275:33.97]On wood to speak.
[275:34.55]This Asian guy.
[275:35.41]So is Bertram like a bad guy?
[276:00.72]Hold on a minute.
[276:01.66]So... The birch reminds me that somebody needs to get killed.
[276:09.82]Uh... The deed will be done by me.
[276:13.45]I got a survivor's license?
[276:16.31]Okay.
[276:30.20]So, does not this license tell the tale of his location?
[276:34.12]Okay, it'll rain blood down on this eastern nightmare.
[276:38.13]Alright.
[276:38.43]I have a question for you.
[276:40.97]One more thing.
[276:58.65]Are you enjoying being a ghoul?
[276:59.95]Oh, he already did it.
[277:01.91]Okay.
[277:02.11]Goodbye.
[277:05.49]Alright.
[277:14.41]So.
[277:15.47]Let's look at the license.
[277:22.92]Virgil Crumb.
[277:25.96]Okay.
[277:28.80]Can I look at it?
[277:29.46]Inspect it?
[277:30.98]California driver's license.
[277:31.98]The name on the license is Virgil Crum.
[277:37.05]Interesting.
[277:43.33]Dermagoria.
[277:44.15]Dermagoria?
[277:45.17]No, I'm not going to finish.
[277:49.43]I'm not going to finish Phantasmagoria tonight.
[277:54.13]Somebody just sprinted by.
[277:55.62]Who was it?
[278:00.77]Okay.
[278:01.37]Into the hospital.
[278:06.69]Am I unironically liking this game?
[278:08.39]The game's fun.
[278:09.59]It's cool.
[278:11.55]It has an interesting vibe to it.
[278:13.35]I like it.
[278:14.53]Alright, so what am I supposed to do about this?
[278:17.61]Well, this girl is gone now.
[278:19.31]Did she die?
[278:19.81]Did I miss my opportunity?
[278:20.79]Is she dead?
[278:23.59]The girl's dead.
[278:24.09]Uh...
[278:32.38]Where did she go?
[278:37.02]No longer with us.
[278:52.20]Blood bank is downstairs.
[278:56.72]She's just gone?
[278:57.88]What?
[278:58.56]No, she can't be gone.
[279:00.57]I'm gonna open this shit up.
[279:01.45]But if we're gonna rob the blood bank, then fuck it.
[279:07.67]Okay, go on in.
[279:08.51]I'm not supposed to be up here.
[279:13.56]Maintenance.
[279:18.88]Whoa!
[279:20.28]Who's carrying a gun in the hospital?
[279:23.32]Who has a... I just freaked out and alt-tabbed.
[279:25.76]Oh, goddammit.
[279:26.46]I think the game's crashed, I think.
[279:29.12]No, it's not.
[279:29.46]We're good.
[279:34.51]Who has a gun?
[279:35.41]What are the dogs just carrying in here?
[279:41.29]What?
[279:43.43]What is this?
[279:44.92]Hey Jason, can you reset Malcolm's password for me?
[279:47.50]He wants it set to pan panache panchetta panacea.
[279:53.29]Malcolm's password is panacea.
[279:58.25]Why are they talking like that?
[280:00.91]Okay, I'm gonna make this really easy.
[280:11.49]What?
[280:11.71]That guy's speaking through a megaphone.
[280:12.97]It's one guy.
[280:15.11]Alright, I have to do this.
[280:22.66]I'm like biting him in the back.
[280:25.16]I don't care.
[280:42.95]Who?
[280:43.65]How do you know I'm even here?
[280:44.73]Oh, hey.
[280:54.53]Jay!
[281:00.77]Come on in.

[281:29.39]Oh, god.

[282:48.83]No.
[282:52.42]Come on!
[282:55.82]I don't want to get up here.

[283:20.22]Oh, there's a vent.
[283:21.20]Okay.
[283:21.64]There's a vent there.
[283:22.22]Just be aware of that.
[283:24.88]Mm-hmm.

[283:30.45]What's over here?
[283:35.91]There.
[283:36.23]Here is prescriptions.

[286:29.97]What?
[286:33.99]Why?
[286:38.15]I don't understand.
[286:47.77]Why did that happen?
[286:51.90]Camera 2.
[286:54.32]Camera 2.
[286:57.44]Prescription storage camera disabled.
[286:59.06]For security purposes, all of the cameras have automatically been enabled.
[287:05.36]Like, it don't even fucking matter.
[287:08.34]What am I looking at here?
[287:12.85]I need blood.
[287:13.81]Okay.
[287:15.75]Blood it is.
[287:20.95]What's in the safe?
[287:22.03]Oh, goddammit.
[287:22.83]There's shit in that safe that I want.
[287:30.17]Damn it.
[287:33.91]Please tell me there's just a cop right here.
[287:37.59]I'm gonna go rob the blood.
[287:39.11]Okay, I hear it.
[287:39.89]He's screaming.
[287:40.49]Okay, I thought it was... So, guys, this is what's going on here.
[287:46.99]This dude is just screaming.
[287:49.65]Like, right here.
[287:54.68]Alright, time to eat somebody.
[287:56.20]We're going back in.
[288:00.67]I don't have any blood packs left.
[288:01.77]I used them.
[288:04.65]Alright, guy pissing.
[288:07.65]No.
[288:08.27]God damn it.
[288:14.02]I'm just gonna go downstairs.
[288:20.58]Blood packs.
[288:21.90]Blood bank.
[288:28.65]Nine lockpicking.
[288:31.56]Yeah, I do, actually.
[288:33.31]I don't have enough money to do this.
[288:38.95]So what does estrogen actually do?
[288:48.75]The blood DMV.
[288:51.09]Oh, I got it.
[288:51.59]I opened it.
[288:51.93]Okay, hold on.
[289:02.68]I'm here.
[289:11.12]Person?
[289:12.76]There's got to be somebody I can eat in here.
[289:13.98]Come on.
[289:14.26]It's about somebody working at their computer or something.
[289:22.77]What the fuck?
[289:24.21]Freezers.
[289:25.85]No, I can't do this.
[289:39.93]I do kind of look like the janitor, though.
[289:41.35]That's the good thing.
[289:43.15]Nothing in the laundry room.
[289:45.75]Wait, what's that?
[289:47.26]No, can't do that.
[289:50.98]This one's locked.
[289:51.66]We're just roaming around the hospital.
[289:56.06]Okay, these are the freezer doors.
[290:01.76]God damn it.
[290:09.53]Oh, hi.
[290:10.17]That's the one that was a nine skill to unlock.
[290:22.53]Maybe being a vampire is just not your thing.
[290:27.91]Nope.
[290:28.47]There's no, like, medicine, blood, pills, nothing.
[290:30.81]Let's see if I can just do this without, um...
[290:41.21]Go in the freezer.
[290:45.45]I need to turn off the freezers, but I don't have a password.
[290:52.91]No, I can't hack either, because if I hack, I'm going to go into a frenzy again.
[291:00.08]What's my stats at right now?
[291:01.92]Everything's all fucked up, isn't it?
[291:08.00]Just bite my own arm.
[291:12.19]shoot through the glass.
[291:16.06]Infestation, laceration, lactation.
[291:20.12]Alright, we're going to quick save here and just try to do this.
[291:26.28]Freezers.
[291:31.63]Ambros.
[291:34.21]Okay, we got it.
[291:37.45]Temperature.
[291:42.40]What do I want to do?
[291:44.50]-2 degrees?
[291:47.57]Passcode.
[291:50.21]Error in retrieving data.
[291:51.27]Contact administration.
[291:54.55]What the fuck?
[291:57.61]Jesus.
[292:16.40]I can't do anything right here.
[292:18.38]What's the point?
[292:18.85]I might just reload the save.
[292:20.17]I have effectively done absolutely nothing since coming in the hospital.
[292:39.40]This was that.
[292:39.90]How long ago was this?
[292:45.25]Reload, reload.
[292:46.21]I actually have no stats.
[292:52.77]Actually, I'm going to probably wind down the stream here in the next 15 minutes or so.
[292:58.96]But... Oh my god.
[293:03.14]Jaiko again!
[293:07.40]Jaiko with $50 again.
[293:09.12]And I'm going to go through all these bits, don't worry, before I take off.
[293:15.39]That's 50 bucks again.
[293:16.81]I saw a few people in chat say this, but have you thought about playing Harvester?
[293:20.15]It's a good game.
[293:20.67]I actually was thinking about playing Harvester tonight.
[293:23.76]If Vampire the Masquerade Ball was not interesting to me, I was going to move on to Harvester.
[293:34.45]Reload before everything went south.
[293:38.25]And all these games are still on the menu.
[293:40.77]It's just a question of when to try to play them.
[293:45.95]Did I play The Suffering?
[293:46.93]I did.
[293:47.19]I played The Suffering four days ago.
[293:49.23]It was the first game I played, actually.
[293:50.85]It was very good.
[293:54.23]So, but just because, I mean, obviously we're trying to burn through a bunch of, like, random Halloween-esque games.
[294:02.70]I think on Tuesday, there's a couple things I really want to do.
[294:08.55]A game came out that I've been wanting to play for a while called Hidden Agenda.
[294:14.44]And that's like, I want to try to get a few friends together and play that because it looks like it's going to be awesome.
[294:19.62]So that's a game I want to play that just came out like last week for a PS4.
[294:26.52]But Harvester is definitely on the menu still.
[294:28.20]And again, Jaiko, thank you so much for the extreme amount of money you've given tonight.
[294:37.09]So let's get back in here.
[294:39.77]I have like one friend.
[294:40.79]That's not true.
[294:44.86]Tentatively, tentatively.
[294:47.50]I don't know what everyone's schedule is, but it's probably going to be like in a tentative way.
[294:55.08]Me, Etalyx, Kryken, Incredible Orb, and somebody else.
[295:01.11]And we're trying to figure out who that might be.
[295:04.01]Those are all tentative.
[295:04.79]Those are all people that I just asked if they were interested.
[295:08.05]And they were like, yeah.
[295:10.55]So it should be fun.
[295:22.31]Me!
[295:30.09]It looks like it could be really funny and really interesting.
[295:36.42]So let's go... This is where we started, right?
[295:40.78]Hopefully this is not gonna... 2245, how long ago was that?
[295:45.63]Which one of these do I want?
[295:46.83]This one?
[295:47.17]The autosave or the quicksave?
[295:49.01]This one, right?
[295:57.87]I think it's the autosave is the one that I want.
[295:59.89]Because that was like five minutes ago.
[296:02.63]Maybe even longer.
[296:03.33]This one, maybe.
[296:03.83]Yeah, this one.
[296:12.36]Let's try this one.
[296:16.03]Because this puts me outside when I shouldn't have even come here in the first place.
[296:22.64]I should not have even gone in here in the first place.
[296:34.15]What's happening?
[296:35.81]Why?
[296:36.11]That just scared the shit out of me.
[296:38.23]This guy just started firing a gun at me.
[296:41.10]Oh Jesus Christ!
[296:43.34]What save was this?
[296:45.48]I don't know what save this was.
[296:49.84]Oh my teeth hurt.
[296:54.14]What the fuck was that?
[297:01.78]We were talking and like I'm sorry I just screamed in everybody's ear.
[297:07.75]I don't even know what that was.
[297:12.98]That was so unexpected.
[297:14.48]I never thought that that was going to be a thing.
[297:17.20]Alright.
[297:20.66]I think I'm actually going to cap the stream here.
[297:25.90]This game is very, very interesting.
[297:27.46]God, there's not like enough time in the day and not enough time to stream everything.
[297:35.68]I've been like, this is five hours now.
[297:39.48]My, like, finite amount of time, like, usually when I get past, like, four and a half hours.
[297:45.20]Like, four to, like, five and a half, six hours is where, like, I start to get, like, you know, my brain starts to slow down.
[297:51.79]I'm old.
[297:53.37]It's the same before this one.
[297:54.47]It's this one here.
[297:55.37]Okay.
[297:55.91]That would make more sense.
[298:03.04]Yes, I am a Malkovian.
[298:04.40]Yeah.
[298:07.04]Nobody's going to say, you haven't gone out.
[298:08.98]I'm hoping they're not going to shoot me.
[298:12.76]I'm on a mafia-based time limit.
[298:14.42]No, I just, you know, if I was sitting here just playing this game, I wouldn't sit here and play it for more than four or five hours in one sitting anyways.
[298:23.06]So that's how I typically, you know, if I sit down today and I'm like, I'm going to play Vampire the Masquerade Ball.
[298:32.42]Usually I don't, like four or five hours is how long I would be sitting here for.
[298:38.00]Alright, so let's just clean up one last thing.
[298:43.33]Virgil, coma, resident of the kids.
[298:45.09]We went in the morgue.
[298:46.03]The medical center.
[298:47.21]This is my brain.
[298:48.37]It just can't fucking function.
[298:53.50]Why do I look like Luigi?
[298:54.50]Because I finally got clothes.
[299:02.18]But, yeah.
[299:03.44]This is, uh... I wanted to do, like, a good, like, four straight days in a row.
[299:08.10]No stream tomorrow.
[299:12.14]Stream... I mean, we're trying to go back to the regular schedule.
[299:16.08]I might add more days in the middle from here on out.
[299:22.12]Because there's a lot of shit that I want to do.
[299:26.52]I want to, like, stream a bunch of stuff.
[299:28.24]There's, like, at least a handful of things I'd like to go back to.
[299:32.12]So, I'm probably going to add a day.
[299:37.18]Instead of it being Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.
[299:39.94]It's probably going to be... I want to say I want to start doing like Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday.
[299:47.97]Or like Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Sunday.
[299:51.64]I'd like to add a day to the week.
[299:53.44]Even like at least temporarily just to try to get through a lot of things I want to play.
[300:00.22]Like, Call of Cthulhu.
[300:01.36]There's a lot of random shit, too.
[300:03.24]This is fun.
[300:03.84]I want to, like, go through this still.
[300:09.74]Depending on when.
[300:10.82]But I don't want to give you guys a false day.
[300:17.90]But just know that starting next week, I'm going to start doing four days a week.
[300:24.34]Somewhere.
[300:26.26]I'm not going to say exact times, but...
[300:29.77]Three days a week has been going good so far.
[300:32.21]And I've been having a lot of fun doing three days a week.
[300:35.76]It lets me mentally prepare for the streams and get ready.
[300:39.16]One day and then off.
[300:39.90]And then one day and then off.
[300:40.76]Pretty much that's how it's been, right?
[300:43.42]But there's a lot to play.
[300:46.66]A bunch of new games just fucking came out.
[300:48.16]There's a lot of things I would like to do.
[300:51.74]The next stream is going to be on Tuesday.
[300:54.10]Normally.
[300:56.60]So we'll go back to normal for Tuesday.
[301:00.06]And then probably this next coming weekend, we'll do another off schedule on Saturday or Sunday or something.
[301:08.67]But thank you so much, everybody.
[301:10.29]This game is actually really fun.
[301:12.17]It's fun.
[301:12.62]It's funny.
[301:13.00]It's interesting.
[301:14.70]And the five hours I've put into it so far have been very good.
[301:20.04]I've actually enjoyed this.
[301:22.96]It's like a mini Fallout with vampires.
[301:31.62]But, anyways.
[301:34.36]Yeah, I need to get some food in me.
[301:35.74]Like, if I don't eat every, if I don't eat in like four or five hours, like, I eat food, I need to go like sit down and like just mow food.
[301:46.37]You're not you when you're hungry.
[301:47.79]Eat a Snickers or you turn into Willem Dafoe.
[301:49.73]Isn't that how the commercial goes?
[301:54.09]Now let's go here.
[301:56.76]Yep.
[301:58.78]Oh, no, that's the fucking turtle from earlier.
[302:00.22]Forget about that.
[302:03.06]I'm going to go through the bits because I missed quite a few of them.
[302:07.24]And there was a lot of support.
[302:10.10]There was a lot of monetary support tonight.
[302:12.32]You guys are too much.
[302:15.62]You guys, like I say frequently, I look over here and I see some of the money that's dropped and I'm just like, holy fucking Jesus.
[302:22.93]That's a lot of money.
[302:24.51]But if you are just sticking around for the stream, then...
[302:29.08]Take care.
[302:29.50]Thanks for coming.
[302:30.40]I'll see you on Tuesday.
[302:31.22]If you're new to the stream, then... Hi.
[302:34.14]Hopefully you enjoyed it.
[302:35.26]Because I had a great time.
[302:38.29]And no, we did not do the tutorial.
[302:40.07]Please don't yell at me.
[302:42.73]Anyways, we're going to go from back to forwards here.
[302:45.91]Thank you, StixRenegade, for the 342.
[302:48.49]Nice EU-friendly stream.
[302:50.07]I know.
[302:50.49]I try... Look.
[302:52.39]I wanted to do a stream today at like four or five o'clock in the afternoon here which would have been like an hour earlier when we started but I did I like I got up late I didn't eat very much food and then like I mosey down I had to take it was an errand I had to do it to errands and like and I got to the point where I could only go at like six yeah EU friendly EU friendly late-night EU now you got me all riled up no but thanks
[303:21.93]uh molotov bartender thanks for the bits how do you handle it Jerma I'm 5 11 and I feel incredibly short do you have any tips uh one that look 5 11 that's like three or four inches higher than the average I sit right on the line
[303:42.85]Are you guys ever gonna get over this like short thing look even even like some jokes and some like random references from like five years ago They live and they die, you know maybe like you got like some of the jokes I've made like over the years and I like the stupid shit.
[304:00.07]We've talked about over the years What's the what's the Half-Life on this one?
[304:07.45]What's the Half-Life on this one Is it gonna keep going forever?
[304:16.83]It's not that I don't think it's funny, it's just like, how long are we gonna go?
[304:23.13]Look, you can't go to like an open mic night and tell the same joke every time you're there.
[304:27.77]The people that are in the audience are gonna be like, I remember this joke, you already told it.
[304:32.09]They're gonna stop fucking throwing shit!
[304:35.59]You gotta get an ashtray in your forehead if you make like the compact streamer joke 400 times in a row at the same club.
[304:48.84]The Toaster Strudels one died, and that was funnier.
[304:52.28]Right?
[304:52.50]If your audience is the same every night, you can.
[304:59.60]I'm not threatening anybody!
[305:01.14]I'm just saying, I'm just saying that if you, like, be careful in the club!
[305:06.33]If you tell the same joke over and over again, somebody's not going to be happy about it.
[305:10.49]Fuck, I can't say that.
[305:11.95]Look, if you tell somebody a joke that they don't think is funny enough times, they're not going to think it's funny.
[305:16.93]The ashtray was a metaphor for sadness.
[305:20.88]That's what it was.
[305:27.26]In the club.
[305:28.94]It's a comedy club.
[305:35.81]Anyways.
[305:37.21]An ass trick.
[305:42.09]Finally, finally somebody gets it.
[305:48.92]I'm so glad that it took like, it took like a few seconds for people to understand that.
[305:57.77]Uh...
[306:02.65]These are in the wrong spot god fuck people are gonna come and think this is a strange just starting Stop bringing it up and reacting to it.
[306:11.18]I'm not even reacting to it You know alright look for it.
[306:15.36]Stop bringing it up and stop reacting to it Let's go over something real real real close under a microscope here for every 12,000
[306:25.83]references to my height I've maybe maybe once a month I will reference one of them you're talking about like it's like 72 000 times somebody in the chat says short right I don't I don't say a damn thing we're talking about like one in like 250 000 what's the percentage there some of you scientists they can look under a microscope what's the percentage for like 250 000 to one

[306:58.95]I'm just fucking around.
[307:00.35]That's what we do here.
[307:01.29]Anyways, I gotta get to the rest of the bits.
[307:03.27]Sometimes it's short-tempered.
[307:25.90]It's not a joke anymore.
[307:26.72]It's just a motto.
[307:34.43]It's funny.
[307:35.55]I've been reading a lot about the Bitcoin thing.
[307:39.13]It's fascinating.
[307:40.58]Everybody else find it.
[307:41.50]Even if you're not investing in it.
[307:43.14]I'm not an investor.
[307:47.54]The world of Bitcoin is fascinating to me.
[307:50.97]It just is.
[307:59.17]There's all kinds of infighting.
[308:00.91]It's crazy.
[308:01.71]It's like a whole other world.
[308:03.05]It's really interesting stuff.
[308:06.93]Anyways.
[308:11.30]Thank you for... I don't even know who I was just talking about.

[310:06.08]Yeah, I'm an extremely attention deficit hyperactivity and easily misguided and very gullible.
[310:11.91]So there you go.
[310:12.45]Those are your three flaws.
[310:22.65]Jerma, just so you know, there's a guy here in Chile watching.
[310:26.67]Keep up doing what you're doing.
[310:27.61]Well, hey, hello!
[310:29.64]Hello from North America!
[310:33.22]Good to see you.
[310:33.70]Hopefully you're having a good time.
[310:36.16]So I have a dog?
[310:36.86]I would identify with a dog, pretty much, yeah.
[310:39.80]Uh, thank you Jerma's Nuts for the... Jerma is nuts, is how I'm gonna spend that one.
[310:44.48]Thank you for the $1.
[310:45.78]Thank you Jay Bird for the $1.
[310:48.26]Jerma, I love you, but you get salty about the dumbest shit.
[310:50.86]No, do I?
[310:52.26]Do I actually, though?
[310:56.30]I mean, I don't think I do.
[311:00.70]I don't think I get, like, angry at dumb things.
[311:04.86]That's not... When you anger, I'm not even... I don't get angry.
[311:11.54]There's a difference between getting, like, actually angry and just, like... Stick... Just talking shit just for fun, you know?
[311:18.60]Half the time, when I'm saying something bad about a game or bad about something, it's usually just... We're just fucking around, you know what I mean?
[311:27.23]For the most part, it's just having fun.
[311:29.03]It's just...
[311:31.86]Not... You got... Yes, I did actually get angry.
[311:35.12]I'm trying to think of the times when I was actually truly angry on stream.
[311:42.36]Like, not like a joke.
[311:43.36]Not like, oh, what the fuck?
[311:44.98]No, no, no.
[311:45.39]Like, actually, like, visibly upset.
[311:47.59]Even within two was one of them.
[311:48.75]I was angry that night.
[311:50.57]I was actually upset at that game.
[311:53.45]I was not happy.
[311:55.87]Uh...
[311:59.74]No, uh, Skate 3 was another one.
[312:02.02]I was, I was angry on that stream.
[312:04.33]Internally, I was screaming.
[312:08.75]Maybe, like, at some point on the PSVR when, like, I, like, the cord, I couldn't, like, stand in the right spot.
[312:18.78]That's it.
[312:19.10]I'm trying to think.
[312:20.04]No, not Cuphead.
[312:20.70]Cuphead was not the same kind of anger.
[312:23.92]Cuphead was like the, what the fuck, no!
[312:26.34]That's that kind of, like, frustration, but still having a good time.
[312:34.61]I'm just bad at games.
[312:35.71]No, I'll go over this again.
[312:39.29]And I want to make sure this is very clear to everybody watching.
[312:43.88]I died, I had 103 deaths in Cuphead.
[312:49.28]I saw people on Twitter talking about how, like, how awesome they did with, like, 350 deaths.
[312:55.35]Like, I saw people bragging on Twitter about how good they did in Cuphead.
[313:00.11]And everyone was like, yeah, you did it.
[313:03.42]Where's my yeah, you did it?
[313:05.22]I die 103 times and, like, beat the game in, like, four and a half hours.
[313:09.22]And where's my yeah, you did it?
[313:22.36]Yeah, you did.
[313:23.38]Yeah, see, there it is.
[313:24.50]Finally, now I feel justified in my video game skill set.
[313:33.24]I don't believe I... I don't believe you.
[313:34.68]I need evidence.
[313:39.51]Anyways, thank you.
[313:40.59]Dubski dude for the three bucks.
[313:42.85]Hey, Jerma, some folks on the Jerma Reddit posted a recent medical study that suggested that marijuana usage helps with the symptoms of Crohn's disease.
[313:50.11]Sometimes even putting it into remission.
[313:52.87]Something to consider because your well-being is important to all of us.
[313:55.37]Stay healthy.
[313:55.93]Yeah.
[313:56.61]Oh, I'm well aware.
[313:58.23]Cannabis is known to be extraordinarily helpful for IBD.
[314:04.14]Crohn's, colitis.
[314:06.28]It's apparently incredible.
[314:08.74]You don't even have to smoke marijuana.
[314:10.44]You can literally take it in a pill.
[314:13.02]So, yeah.
[314:14.74]Oh, I'm well aware.
[314:17.29]But I appreciate it, though.
[314:18.41]Thank you for your concern.
[314:21.27]um but cannabis I guess is becoming one of those but that's the thing then you get into the you get into the weeds with like the pharmaceutical company bullshit yeah I don't want to I don't want to get all political on you guys but like
[314:38.38]I don't know, man.
[314:40.20]It'll never be allowed fully.
[314:42.20]It's so hard to even get anybody to vote positively on marijuana.
[314:47.76]It's seen as this terrible thing that half of our population thinks is awful and should go away.
[314:54.03]And guys, I don't smoke weed.
[314:59.66]I don't smoke it.
[315:00.44]I don't even smoke it.
[315:01.06]I don't even go near it.
[315:02.89]I don't smoke marijuana.
[315:04.89]But I understand the benefits of it.
[315:06.67]I understand like why it needs to be a thing that we take into society.
[315:11.95]And it's no different than... It's better... Look at people... Alcohol.
[315:16.38]I could go off for like an hour on this and I don't even fucking smoke weed.
[315:23.66]You put it up your ass.
[315:24.78]What?
[315:26.14]Easy.
[315:30.08]So many people can benefit from it being completely legalized.
[315:32.86]It doesn't... It's not even a fucking drug.
[315:36.09]It's a goddamn plant.
[315:37.21]It's no different than, like, eating lettuce.
[315:43.03]It's no different.
[315:43.47]If you, like, smoked a... If you, like, smoked a pineapple, it'd be no different.
[315:47.09]Except, yeah, it would.
[315:47.99]It would be bad for you.
[315:48.71]Don't do that.
[315:53.94]Actually, it probably wouldn't be a bad thing.
[315:59.94]Uh, how do we get here?
[316:00.78]I don't know.
[316:02.82]A weed suppository.
[316:04.60]You know what?
[316:05.12]It might exist.
[316:07.17]I don't know.
[316:11.37]We have stigmas on the weirdest things in the world.
[316:13.35]Don't ask me why.
[316:15.93]Blame the fucking pilgrims.
[316:21.12]Turkey-eating assholes.
[316:26.26]What is this like Sunday shit, by the way?
[316:28.66]Let me go on.
[316:29.20]Let's talk about this.
[316:31.12]Sunday.
[316:32.32]Why do we close a bunch of stores on Sunday?
[316:35.14]Like early.
[316:36.36]What happened?
[316:36.78]Why?
[316:37.38]It's Sunday.
[316:39.82]Oh, no, it's Sunday.
[316:40.70]All stores have to close at six o'clock, five o'clock.
[316:44.36]Why?
[316:46.30]What happened?
[316:50.36]No, you can't wake me up.
[316:51.60]Sorry.
[316:52.66]Everything has to close at like 4 o'clock on Sunday.
[316:55.46]Is that because of what exactly?
[316:59.14]It's a church thing?
[317:00.92]It's a pilgrim shit.
[317:02.36]Get your fucking turkey-eating pilgrim motherfucking ass out of here.
[317:04.76]You know what I'm saying?
[317:06.99]I went to the store.
[317:08.47]I drove by a store that I really wanted to go to and it was Sunday.
[317:11.67]And it was like 5.45 and I knew I wasn't going to make it.
[317:14.11]I wasn't going to be there in 15 minutes, 10 minutes.
[317:16.31]And I was just in the car just cursing the pilgrims.
[317:21.79]Just talking about like the fucking bunch of assholes.
[317:27.52]Jerma wants people to work more.
[317:29.28]No, no.
[317:29.86]You can work a full Sunday, but you don't have to work a full Monday.
[317:33.96]We have this weird notion that you have to work like every day and then you have Saturday and Sunday.
[317:38.69]Like, no.
[317:40.82]Figure out what days work the best for you and let people work when they're able to and when they want to and make hours accordingly.
[317:48.24]I don't... I'm of the opinion.
[317:50.68]Listen to this opinion.
[317:52.00]Why do stores even have to fucking close?
[317:56.27]Why?
[317:57.67]You know how many people, like, I mean, well, obviously, like, this is going off a different tangent, but how many people would actually work?
[318:04.41]Like, instead of, like, wanting to go to work at, like, 9 o'clock in the morning, how many of you guys would rather go to work at, like, fucking 10 o'clock at night?
[318:13.18]Right?
[318:15.36]How could, how would that, oh God.
[318:20.74]Like, back when I was like trying to find a job, I would, Jaybird, thank you for the $100.
[318:25.85]Hold on.
[318:30.67]Jaybird8991 just gave a hundred bucks.
[318:33.39]It says, go buy some milk so you can grow up big and tall.
[318:37.72]I'm going to let that one slide.
[318:39.90]I'm going to let that one slide because you gave me a hundred dollars to say that.
[318:44.81]Thank you for the milk.
[318:46.77]I will gladly drink it for $100.
[318:50.01]But thank you.
[318:51.95]Thank you, Jaybird, for that.
[318:54.51]It's very generous of you.
[318:57.03]And now everyone's fucking laughing about it a little bit.
[318:59.09]Just a small amount.
[319:01.35]It's alright, then.
[319:05.22]Thanks, dude.
[319:05.74]I appreciate it.
[319:06.32]Really, thank you.
[319:08.30]$100 milk.
[319:08.94]Do I have to buy, like, 40 milks?
[319:13.36]Paid insults.
[319:16.45]Where was I going?
[319:17.77]Oh yeah, right.
[319:18.33]Like work.
[319:22.71]I don't know.
[319:23.21]I feel like that stores don't even like, if you go to like, like Las Vegas, like ruined me because everything is just open in Las Vegas 24 seven.
[319:31.88]I went to Vegas and it was just like, it was just, it was, everything was open and it was crazy.
[319:36.25]It was awesome.
[319:38.70]Like, there are so many places that have, like, 24-hour, like, work cycles, and it's just like, holy shit, this is just, it's amazing.
[319:46.30]Nothing ever stops.
[319:48.68]People just cycle employees, you cycle workers, and that's it.
[319:57.92]Just come to New York.
[320:02.13]I can't tell you how many times I wish, like, I could just, even, like, right now.
[320:04.79]Like,
[320:11.83]Coming from the man who doesn't have a regular job.
[320:13.75]I used to.
[320:14.35]I used to have, like, a regular, in quotes, job.
[320:21.65]I used to have a regular job, in quotes.
[320:25.68]But, like, it's 11.15 right now, right?
[320:29.90]And you guys know as well as I do.
[320:31.36]As much as, like...
[320:34.45]As much as you guys, like, we can talk shit to each other and just kind of have fun.
[320:38.28]But you're all still up.
[320:39.54]We're up right now.
[320:40.22]Like, what do you guys do for food after, like, midnight?
[320:42.00]What do you do?
[320:46.98]What are you supposed to do after 12 o'clock?
[320:48.60]Or, like, 1 o'clock in the morning?
[320:50.21]I'm going to be up for, like, another, like, at least two or three hours.
[320:56.71]Like, frozen pizza, cereal, Oreos, McDonald's.
[321:00.63]Why should we have to only have to deal with like McDonald's for those of us that are the millions, the hundreds of billions of us that are night owls, right?
[321:10.16]There are at least like 200 to 300 billion night owls that live in America.
[321:15.80]Just America.
[321:17.40]So if there's that many of us, then I'm just surprised that we haven't been catered to.
[321:29.30]Anyways, let's go back to the bits.
[321:31.15]You know what I'm talking about.
[321:32.27]You read through the lines there and you find my actual point.
[321:37.67]There's a lot of owls in America.
[321:39.69]You know that's where most owls are?
[321:42.07]The American night owl.
[321:43.29]Look it up.
[321:48.31]Nocturnal.
[321:48.85]No, not nocturnal.
[321:50.47]I'm not nocturnal, just hungry.
[321:54.05]And I don't want to eat McDonald's.
[321:58.60]And this is, yeah, you can make like a cold cut sandwich.
[322:02.39]I could like boil some spaghetti right now, but I want to like have options.
[322:11.97]Most American night owls are in America.
[322:16.11]Cook stuff.
[322:16.57]Yeah, maybe you could cook too, but like sometimes you just don't want to.
[322:23.51]I like the nighttime war.
[322:24.43]It's so peaceful.
[322:25.07]It is like, listen, listen right now.
[322:27.81]I'm gonna open the window for you.
[322:29.01]Listen.
[322:29.23]You hear that?
[322:36.71]It's a whole lot of nothing out there.
[322:41.33]I can just hear the... I can hear, like, the birds chirping.
[322:46.88]Shh.
[322:47.60]Yeah.
[322:52.10]I can hear the crickets.
[322:55.42]The birds chirping overnight, yeah.
[322:58.77]Alright, let's get back to the bits.
[322:59.71]Like, I've been on, like, the ending screen for, like, fucking 25 minutes now.
[323:09.21]Do a cooking stream.
[323:10.04]I wish I... I just need... I can't set it up.
[323:11.78]It's, like, too much work to set up.
[323:13.94]I don't have the kitchen for it.
[323:16.08]It'd be so hard to do that.
[323:17.98]It would take, like... That would take a long time to figure out how the hell to even do that.
[323:23.47]I'd have to be somewhere, like, a different, like, on location somewhere.
[323:27.56]But anyways, thank you so much, Coco, for the 10 bucks.
[323:30.28]Also, thank you to... Jay Bird from earlier was the one that said I got salty.
[323:37.85]And he came in with 100.
[323:38.51]Hold on, so, Jeremiah, I love you, but you get salty about the dumbest shit.
[323:43.36]And then came in with another donation about, like, how small I am.
[323:48.17]huh come on like should I come on I should be able to be should I get upset about that or was I paid to not be upset I'm not sure but thank you uh also thank you to stuff from thing for the five dollars just says I love you well thanks man Jerma's nuts again uh that was two donation from Jerma's nuts added one dollar each so find the joke there I'm sure you can find it pretty easily uh

[324:16.84]I know.
[324:17.28]Puff for the $1.
[324:18.46]Jeremy, last time I gave you bits, you didn't notice my messages.
[324:22.86]Oh, shit.
[324:23.18]I hope they're still here.
[324:25.14]Because that would be bad.
[324:26.37]But I love you anyway, and I wanted to thank you for all the amazing content you've given us throughout the years.
[324:30.75]You're an inspiration.
[324:32.43]Keep doing your thing.
[324:33.11]Well, thank you.
[324:35.03]Thank you.
[324:35.97]Thank you, Puff, if you're still here.
[324:38.67]Know that you are appreciated.
[324:40.31]So thank you so much.
[324:43.26]Uh...
[324:44.83]Also, thank you to Bone Jackal for the $3.
[324:47.65]Let's turn to the starting screen.
[324:50.56]No.
[324:52.92]Thank you, Bone Jackal, for $3.
[324:53.76]Hey, Jerma, thanks for all the free entertainment you've given me throughout the years.
[324:57.38]Times have been rough, but thanks to your streams, I'm coming out of my cage...
[325:01.31]I've been doing just fine gotta gotta be down because I want it all it started out with a kiss how did it end up like this it was only a kiss it was there was a way there's like five different songs in there I'm not sure what's good thank you bone jackal but I I don't know what's going on thank you for the three bucks
[325:30.06]Thank you, Nock, for the bits as well.
[325:31.53]Max out your computer skills.
[325:32.96]Trust me, I probably will.
[325:35.78]Jaybird earlier as well gave $4.45.
[325:39.36]I've been watching your streams for a while now, and I finally got a job, so expect a lot more bits than this soon.
[325:45.68]So, Jaybird, that was five hours ago.
[325:47.74]You were not lying.
[325:48.96]You were not kidding.
[325:51.58]That was real.
[325:52.52]So, thank you for the $4.45 five hours ago.
[325:54.26]Appreciate it, man.
[325:58.24]You weren't kidding.
[326:00.72]MGSFan, MedicalSolidFan18, thanks for the bits.
[326:02.87]Happy birthday, Jeremy.
[326:04.05]Well, thank you.
[326:06.57]Thank you.
[326:07.69]It is my birthday.
[326:10.35]It's not, but thank you, though.
[326:14.00]BLB24, thank you for the $1.
[326:15.16]Hey, Jeremy, I found your channel a few months back, and I've been a big fan ever since.
[326:19.28]Thanks for making such great stuff.
[326:20.54]It really helps me get through.
[326:22.54]It really helps me get a good laugh when I need it.
[326:24.06]Well, I'm glad you feel that way.
[326:26.81]I'm glad that I can be somebody that you think is funny.
[326:32.97]I think about this every day.
[326:35.83]I think about this type of shit all the time.
[326:40.65]If I can't... If I can't at least have fun and try to engage and involve everybody and try to have as much fun as I can... I don't... It's not about being funny.
[326:56.11]It's about having fun.
[326:58.50]And that can be done in a million different ways, right?
[327:01.11]You don't have to, like, tell jokes to be fun or funny.
[327:03.25]You don't have to, like... I think we all collectively can be funny whenever, like... There's no... I don't know.
[327:10.32]I don't like to put, like, the name, like, funny.
[327:13.92]Because there's a million different things.
[327:16.60]Funny is so subjective.
[327:19.42]That what somebody thinks is funny, somebody else might be like, that was dumb or terrible.
[327:22.93]So it's like a...
[327:27.42]You know, it's weird.
[327:30.38]The stream is over.
[327:31.24]The stream is over.
[327:35.32]Almost done here.
[327:35.92]Got like another five to ten of these to go.
[327:41.58]And we're here.
[327:45.98]Peaceful Haley, thank you for the bits.
[327:47.94]Ever thought about getting a bird?
[327:49.26]Ah, yes.
[327:52.69]There was a fancy conure.
[327:55.35]That was at a pet shop that I drive by sometimes.
[328:01.46]And I wanted to get it because it was just such a cool bird.
[328:05.28]They like dogs.
[328:06.38]They listen to you.
[328:07.08]They like walk up to you.
[328:08.02]They talk to you.
[328:10.00]It was... How do you pronounce it?
[328:13.40]Conure?
[328:14.28]I think I'm saying it right.
[328:19.35]Maybe.
[328:22.76]It's called a fancy con something.
[328:24.64]It's the only bird I think I've ever wanted just because it was so interesting looking.
[328:28.28]Anyways, thank you.
[328:31.82]Scootboot, thanks for the dollar.
[328:33.70]Molotov Bartender, thanks for the bits as well.
[328:38.23]You gave a few times now.
[328:41.19]BLB, again, thank you for the bits.
[328:42.85]I know you don't have a Switch, but do you plan on it?
[328:45.27]Yes.
[328:46.27]That's what I was talking about when there's so many games to play and there's so many things to stream, man.
[328:50.99]Like Mario Odyssey I want to play.
[328:52.69]There's like three new games.
[328:55.41]I want to play Assassin's Creed Origins just because it's an open world game with a horse.
[329:00.33]I told you guys this yesterday.
[329:03.49]I have to play it.
[329:04.50]I have to.
[329:08.98]Oi, you still never read my bits from the beginning of the stream.
[329:12.50]Sorry, Molotov.
[329:14.12]I'm doing it now.
[329:16.64]But thank you Molotov for your multiple bits.
[329:19.18]StixRenegade, thanks for the 342 a few hours ago.
[329:22.38]Now you have to dab IRL and don't say no.
[329:24.80]Well, I'm going to say no.
[329:26.09]No.
[329:27.43]Nock, thanks for the bits.
[329:28.57]SurrealRose, thanks for the bits as well.
[329:31.45]What are my thoughts on bunnies?
[329:32.55]They're great.
[329:34.01]They're fluffy, they're interesting, and you just got to make sure you don't run them over with your car.
[329:37.60]Because they always run in front of the road.
[329:38.90]They're like squirrels, but they're not as intelligent and they get run over all the time.
[329:42.85]uh but anyways yeah bunnies are great uh crunchy crunchy thanks for the bits vampire the masquerade just cracking open a boy with the cold ones uh thanks for the one dollar nightfang thanks for the one dollar again uh no this is a new donation thank you nightfang for the one dollar new one dollar play legacy of kane solar river next stream please uh I I think I've actually played solar river before
[330:12.15]I don't remember if I really liked it or not.
[330:13.69]Maybe.
[330:15.77]But, uh, thank you again, Nightfang.
[330:16.93]Do you know that if you eat, shit, and drink... Nope, we're not doing that one.
[330:19.67]Thank you.
[330:21.53]Uh, do you know... Well, actually, I already said it.
[330:23.69]Might as well finish it.
[330:25.17]You know that if you eat, shit, and drink, piss, it comes back out as food and water.
[330:28.11]Well, thank... You would be going against every scientific paper ever invented.
[330:33.25]Uh... Aleblood, thank you for the 25 cents.
[330:37.66]Carcar, thanks for the 5 bucks.
[330:40.29]Hey, Jerma, you've helped me out a lot in the years that I've been watching your content, but as of late, I've been in a huge rut.
[330:46.43]It's a long story, but long story short, I have no friends.
[330:49.34]Lend me some kind words.
[330:52.04]Well... Car, car, thank you, first of all, for the $5.
[330:55.68]And second of all... Making friends is...
[331:05.31]And at this stage, in the way that the world is now, like, finding new people to, like, come across and finding, like, new relationships and quotes is very, like, actually very difficult.
[331:16.76]And I guess the advice that I could give to anybody that's like, oh, I'm looking at how do you, like, make some new friends is kind of like this space.
[331:25.58]You know what I mean?
[331:26.06]Like, it's just like this space, like the digital world we live in, it's like a lot easier to find a group of people that like the same things you do that you can talk to.
[331:38.61]And if you're not talking about like in a digital sense, like...
[331:42.43]even just like trying to find like an activity to do or like doing taking a class or I don't know how old you are but depending on if you have like anybody that you could like even like family members or something you could go out and get yourself out there somewhere but it's it is fairly difficult just because people everyone likes to stay like in their own little bubbles and trying to like make your way into somebody else's bubble is much more difficult than I think a lot of us realize
[332:14.05]So I would say, at least in like a digital sense, there are probably thousands of people on this website.
[332:22.83]Various stream communities, people have discords and that people hang out in.
[332:28.81]If you're looking for something like that, then I mean, I have a Discord and I'm sure there's plenty of people that would love to hang out and talk.
[332:34.41]People hang out and talk there every day.
[332:39.38]But yeah, just try to be yourself.
[332:42.42]Try to talk to people that like the same things you do.
[332:44.34]I mean, that's how I made a lot of my friends recently.
[332:48.63]Look at Etalyx.
[332:50.55]Etalyx is a guy that made videos, and I made videos too.
[332:54.29]And we just kind of started talking because of that.
[332:58.70]I don't know Etalyx.
[333:00.00]Etalyx wasn't one of my high school friends.
[333:03.54]I met him online, just being in the same space.
[333:08.80]But thank you, Karkar, for the five bucks.
[333:13.26]Also, thank you to... Frexter.
[333:18.51]Thanks for the one dollar.
[333:19.41]Is one dollar enough to make you finish Phantasmagoria 2?
[333:22.89]No.
[333:26.33]Maybe one day we'll do, like, a finish the game stream.
[333:28.65]Where, like, I just play, like, four or five games that are, like, almost done.
[333:31.38]And just beat them.
[333:34.02]But, maybe.
[333:34.52]Maybe.
[333:35.94]Again, thank you to Frap Spackle for the bits.
[333:38.52]Come, my lady.
[333:39.28]Come, come, my lady.
[333:41.60]More songs, but thank you.
[333:45.17]Ostrich doing... Ostrich doing aerobics.
[333:49.35]Thanks for the $5.
[333:51.37]Had to make sure I subbed you before star.
[333:54.85]Well, I appreciate that.
[333:55.81]I appreciate the $5 and the sub.
[334:03.42]Pikachu, baka, 12, thanks for the $1.
[334:05.82]We need more Reiki jokes.
[334:09.00]We need more Reiki jokes.
[334:10.82]It's hard to make a Reiki joke.
[334:13.52]Whoa, somebody just gave $10 right here.
[334:19.45]We'll get up to that one in a minute.
[334:20.45]Kilgannon, thanks for the $1.
[334:22.05]Augmented, thanks for the $1.
[334:25.95]Kilgannon again, thanks for the $1.
[334:27.52]Have I ever played PsyOps?
[334:31.68]It's a great older game, also very funny to watch.
[334:33.96]I've never played it.
[334:37.10]I would love to check it out.
[334:38.74]I will look it up after the stream ends because I'm always into looking up new stuff.
[334:44.00]Thank you, Sir Feline, for the $5.
[334:45.84]Rap movie now or never?
[334:48.13]No, that doesn't mean never.
[334:49.95]I'm just going to play it one time.
[334:51.19]I'm going to play it.
[334:54.13]I'm going to play it when you least expect it.
[334:59.05]But thank you, Sir Feline, for your $5.
[335:02.10]PikachuBaka12 for the $1.
[335:03.86]I've been here for five hours watching you play this dumb fucking game.
[335:08.54]I wouldn't do that if it were anyone else.
[335:10.38]I don't regret any second I've spent watching you.
[335:12.72]You are my favorite person ever.
[335:15.32]Well, Pikachu.
[335:16.74]Thank you, PikachuBaka, for your $1, but... I mean, yeah, I like that game.
[335:21.59]It's not bad.
[335:23.35]But thank you.
[335:24.71]That is incredibly humbling to hear somebody say that.
[335:30.09]That's...
[335:31.78]It's very grounding to hear that people are like watching me play this game because it's me.
[335:36.58]That's... Keep my head on, you know what I'm saying guys?
[335:44.59]Don't ever let my head float away.
[335:47.37]I refuse to do it.
[335:49.83]You guys are all fucking awesome.
[335:53.65]I'm the strongest streamer and the best streamer.
[335:56.82]I might be the strongest.
[335:59.72]I'll do like an arm wrestling match with somebody and lose and then just blame it on like the environment.
[336:05.89]Stix Renegade.
[336:07.09]Stix gave 25 cents like 10 times in a row here.
[336:11.71]It says stream will never end.
[336:13.75]Endless stream.
[336:15.31]It'll never end.
[336:16.97]Well, it will.
[336:17.61]It will in about 25 seconds.
[336:20.25]Well, no, like two minutes.
[336:22.65]Techno Toast, thanks for the bits.
[336:23.95]Endless bit stream.
[336:26.01]Well, this is how we're ending our streams this last week.
[336:30.14]Because I wasn't able to read bits on stream.
[336:33.34]So we do it at the end.
[336:35.85]We'll go back to normal on Tuesday.
[336:37.59]Because we're not going to be playing, I don't think, an old game that has a crash problem.
[336:43.54]But Zenith Gaming, thank you for the bits.
[336:46.05]Your streamed videos cheer me up whenever I'm down, so thanks for putting so much love and effort into your work.
[336:50.73]And I hope your channel continues to grow and flourish.
[336:54.21]Well, thank you, Zenith Gaming.
[336:56.69]That's really nice.
[336:58.09]Hopefully, over the next few months, I'll have some more announcements for you guys regarding video content.
[337:04.46]Because for those of you that weren't here last night, I did say...
[337:09.29]um that no longer going to be working with a company for any of the future projects and that's what sort of halted a lot of the things I wanted to do is there were there was a bunch of different potentials that didn't end up happening and it was financial it was it was money it was trying to
[337:33.38]It was trying to keep control of what I wanted to do and be able to do it the way that I wanted to and have like thousands of dollars to make it.
[337:43.26]And that was like the hard part was trying to figure out like how I could do that.
[337:47.96]And there was a lot of potential.
[337:49.94]But at the end of the day, it just it's not it's not going to happen.
[337:56.09]And the other the other opportunities that could be happening are
[338:00.13]are completely unrelated at this point and they'll be like the next year potentially so for now I think I am going to go ahead with the the Patreon idea and only use those funds to make videos if you were here last night we talked about a little bit at the end of the stream but I will give way more details when the time comes so I hope uh hopefully we can make some cool
[338:30.80]And it'll, you know, get back to, get back to work on the main channel, as we say, right?
[338:37.10]But, yeah, that's kind of where that stands.
[338:41.27]Uh, so, also, thank, well, thank you again, Zendesk, appreciate it.
[338:46.89]Uh, I'm, I am Monk, thank you, uh, yeah, you did it, thank you.
[338:52.02]Ben9c9, thank you for the bits, thanks for speaking up for the night, people.
[338:58.65]yeah I am very much a night person and I will defend our lands from the day people it's just a constant it's just day and night it's just constant battle between day and night but uh thank you thank you also crunchy again for the one dollar cooking stream is a great idea and I would cook I would cook with you live I would love to do like a total joke I told you about the total joke cooking stream I'd love to make it a reality
[339:25.97]But rounding out the night, we have a few more, and then I'm gonna end the stream.
[339:32.95]You missed my donation during the Shadow of War stream, ZenThisGaming.
[339:36.81]CompactStreamer is also blind.
[339:40.71]No.
[339:42.79]No.
[339:44.43]I'm not.
[339:46.21]Like I told you guys before, I just have some trouble keeping up with subs, donations, because like I told you, when I play a game, I'm like focused on my screen here.
[339:55.50]and I want to talk about the game and talk about what's going on and look at the chat and interact with like chat and sometimes it can just like float by my brain that like also there's like a lot of people giving money and support and subs and donations and I get like tunnel visioned into the game and we're into like the joke or the bit or the scenery or the cutscene and I lose track and I apologize for that.
[340:20.17]I'm sorry that that happens.
[340:23.30]Jerma keeping up with subs in 2017.
[340:25.46]I know it's bad, but I can't do it.
[340:28.54]My ADHD does not allow me to do it.
[340:30.94]But there is a solution.
[340:32.04]It's gonna happen.
[340:33.58]You're gonna get end credits.
[340:35.00]It's gonna be so cool.
[340:36.86]All these streamers are gonna fucking look at my end credits and they're gonna be like, I gotta do that too.
[340:40.73]There's gonna be a big end credits boom of 2018.
[340:44.13]Guaranteed.
[340:47.35]There's gonna be a boom.
[340:48.73]I'm gonna open up a new trend on Twitch.
[340:51.31]Just you wait.
[340:58.42]Play some not dumb games, please.
[341:01.01]Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines is a great game.
[341:08.59]This last week has been just like Halloween.
[341:10.39]You know, trying to go find some old classic.
[341:13.89]Suffering was good too.
[341:14.89]What?
[341:16.63]Suffering is a great game.
[341:21.19]Come on.
[341:24.03]Anywho, thank you Crunchy again.
[341:25.63]Zenith.
[341:26.41]Zenith.
[341:26.85]Zen this.
[341:29.17]For real, Del, thanks for the $1.
[341:30.19]Play... Play... What am I playing on this stream?
[341:36.32]Rainfall?
[341:39.22]It's too late now.
[341:43.08]Also, thank you, SticksRenegade, again, for the $10.
[341:45.38]For me, at least, maybe it's not a popular opinion.
[341:47.86]But I don't try to look forward to the big things in life, mainly the little things like days off, YouTube bids, and your streams.
[341:54.14]They keep me happy.
[341:55.34]And that's another thing, guys, is like people talking about like, oh, I don't feel that great.
[342:01.81]I'm trying to look to the future.
[342:03.21]I'm trying to think of like the next big thing.
[342:05.47]How do I get like, you know, any advice?
[342:09.57]and you just have to every day just try to better yourself somehow even small or you try to make yourself happy try to make somebody else happy even in a tiny way you don't have to like go buy like your your friend like a new Lamborghini just make yourself slight do something positive for yourself at least like once or twice a week every day if you can and little things add up two big things
[342:37.20]A big thing can't be a big thing unless it's a bunch of little things turned into a big thing.
[342:41.75]You know?
[342:42.37]Like when you build a building, when they build a fucking skyscraper, they don't just drop a skyscraper with like four helicopters just boom into the ground.
[342:52.23]No, it starts off as like foundation, then like a couple of shitty bricks, and then like more bricks, and then they put like some steel around that, and they keep going until it's a building.
[343:03.04]Big things are a bunch of little things.
[343:06.72]That's it.
[343:10.13]that's how it works in The Sims those are strong helicopters but it's true yeah thank you sticks though uh turian thank you for the five dollars again I always love your ability to create rivers in the desert you're like the last ace in the last hand a heartbeat for a tin man an oasis in a singed land
[343:41.11]Thank you, Turian.
[343:42.63]I don't know if that was original poetry or if that was lifted from somewhere, but thank you.
[343:50.26]Rick Billy, thanks for the bits.
[343:52.50]I'm sad and bored.
[343:53.82]Say something funny.
[343:59.12]I don't know.
[343:59.82]I got nothing for you.
[344:01.24]Just take the last two minutes and then maybe I said something interesting there.
[344:05.00]Go back, rewind two minutes and find the funny thing that I may have said.
[344:09.47]Kale Gannon, thanks for the $5.
[344:10.73]Here's some more money, Jerma, for being awesome.
[344:12.69]PsyOps has crazy physics-based combat and shit.

[344:17.83]Okay, now I have to know.
[344:18.81]I have to see it.
[344:21.33]Rick Bilby, thank you for the bits over and over again.

[344:47.85]And it's going to be bigger and better than the last one.
[344:50.87]There's going to be lots more insane shit that I wish I could have done in the first one, and I couldn't.
[344:55.10]I wish I could say some of the jokes.
[344:56.44]In fact, I might just say one right now.
[344:58.48]No, that would ruin it.
[345:00.06]This is like locked under a login key.
[345:04.31]It's going to be fucking insane.
[345:06.57]It's gonna be ten times more interesting and crazier than the first one.
[345:10.19]But there we go.
[345:11.29]Never trust a purple thing for the five dollars.
