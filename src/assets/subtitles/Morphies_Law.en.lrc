[00:02.20]Hello everybody.
[00:05.12]Welcome.
[00:08.00]Hope you're having a good day.
[00:09.74]Hope you had a good last couple of days.
[00:14.93]Last time I saw you was on Saturday.
[00:17.35]It's been two days.
[00:19.83]Hope you finished all your homework.
[00:22.13]Because weekend is over.
[00:24.19]It's time to start a new week.
[00:27.70]Yesterday.
[00:28.96]Hope you finished it all.
[00:32.21]How's the box?
[00:34.11]Uh, the box is gone.
[00:36.15]All the Labo stuff is gone.
[00:38.51]It is no longer inside of my house.
[00:42.87]It's gone.
[00:47.25]Everyone's so sad.
[00:49.37]Oh, that... God, I wish you still had that Nintendo Labo.
[01:01.62]It was fun.
[01:03.04]For a while, yeah.
[01:05.50]I don't... Here's the... Okay, let me give you my final review of the Nintendo Labo.
[01:11.49]The variety kit was... I think was worth it.
[01:15.55]There was a lot to do.
[01:16.25]There was a lot of little things to discover.
[01:17.75]You could go through research and see all the scientific properties of all the cardboard in there.
[01:25.42]The robot was just one project and it was like a four and a half hour project.
[01:29.76]The piano took that long.
[01:32.37]So the piano took as long as the entire box back here.
[01:37.18]And that was $80.
[01:38.16]The variety kit was $60.
[01:39.74]Or $70.
[01:48.65]Quick rank, the Labo builds.
[01:51.33]In terms of... A 10 would be, wow, that was fun.
[01:55.57]And a 1 would be... I don't know about that one.
[02:00.14]I think the piano was the coolest of them all, but the piano was a one to build.
[02:04.24]That sucked.
[02:05.60]Making all those keys was terrible.
[02:07.07]The fishing rod would be the best.
[02:08.59]Fishing rod for sure.
[02:19.98]That's fair.
[02:20.82]That was cool.
[02:21.88]But anyways, so today... The motorcycle was fun.
[02:26.23]But the fishing rod, I liked the... The little pulley inside with the rubber bands.
[02:30.21]It was cool.
[02:32.17]So, uh... Let's talk about the next couple of weeks.
[02:36.17]We have... We're gonna play... I got the Switch hooked up here still.
[02:40.78]And Morphe's Law just came out yesterday.
[02:43.04]It's a game.
[02:44.78]It's a shooter.
[02:45.30]It's a third-person shooter.
[02:46.40]And you run around...
[02:49.11]What do you?
[02:50.39]It's a game, but you run around, and there are weapons.
[02:54.57]Now, the little catch with this game is the more that you shoot, the more your character grows.
[03:01.01]And if you get shot, you shrink.
[03:03.15]And you can get to be as big as the whole map, apparently.
[03:06.35]So, it's apparently alright.
[03:09.44]I don't think it's getting rave reviews, but it seems like a fun enough thing to play for a little bit.
[03:15.08]Kind of reminds me, just from the trailers, of... Do you remember, like, Agario?
[03:20.27]Where you walked around as the little circle?
[03:22.19]You know, you ran around.
[03:23.17]There's another game where you run around.
[03:24.77]So it's got that in it.
[03:26.65]And you sucked up all the little circles to become the huge circle, but then you become a target.
[03:31.64]I guess it's like that.
[03:33.04]The more you... Depending on how well you're doing, you just keep growing.
[03:39.02]We'll find out.
[03:41.72]But anyways, I do... A lot of people probably trickled in here where I want to talk about a couple of things.
[03:47.72]So currently it is Tuesday the 21st.
[03:51.56]I am in overdrive mode.
[03:53.50]I'm painting my bathrooms at the moment.
[03:56.62]Somebody's coming to see the house tomorrow.
[03:59.51]So this is where it's going to start to ramp up.
[04:01.43]I told you.
[04:01.91]I tried to tell you.
[04:03.17]I tried to warn you.
[04:04.87]But the next few weeks, I'm going to be gone.
[04:09.65]Not this week.
[04:12.03]But next week into September, I'm going to be gone.
[04:16.37]I'm going to be in Vegas.
[04:17.91]But that doesn't mean you're not going to get a stream.
[04:21.43]See, if you were in the pre-stream chat, we've already talked about a piece of content that I'm going to do.
[04:26.96]So what's going to happen is during that trip to Vegas,
[04:31.57]I'm not going to go walk the strip and show you all this cool stuff in Vegas.
[04:34.90]No, I'm going to buy a bunch of potato chips and I'm going to do a chip review inside of my hotel room.
[04:46.55]I come in Las Vegas.
[04:48.51]All this stuff to see.
[04:49.81]No, I'm doing a couple of bed streams where I'm going to review Pringles.
[04:56.97]And we'll just talk for like an hour or two.
[05:03.60]Do a beach vlog?
[05:05.12]There are no beaches.
[05:06.72]It's the desert, man.
[05:09.16]But, so, I'm going to be in Las Vegas for a full week.
[05:13.64]Because this is the trip where everything gets done, all the papers get signed, and the move-in process begins.
[05:21.17]I'm not moving in next week.
[05:24.17]I'm starting the process to do paperwork to get in a place.
[05:30.54]The move-in date is probably going to be somewhere in late September.
[05:34.24]So there'll be another week where I have to go take care of a bunch of stuff and go actually be in a different house.
[05:42.79]So, what we are going to do, because I've seen quite a few people... Let's just get the game on here.
[05:50.30]I've seen quite a few people ask about, hey, what are you, wait, you're moving?
[05:53.99]What are you talking about?
[05:54.65]Where are you going?
[05:55.83]Well, I'm going to make sure we can have, especially during the week that I'm gone, if you haven't been watching the streams and you have no idea, I've talked about it a bunch, but what we're going to do is we're going to record a Vegas voicemail for people that don't know.
[06:10.02]People that have no idea I'm moving, right?
[06:11.82]So you're going to be able to do a little exclamation point Vegas, and it'll play this Vegas voicemail.
[06:17.64]So I'm going to do it right now.
[06:19.04]So just make sure we get it clipped.
[06:22.15]And this will be what will be played when you do Exclamation Point Vegas.
[06:27.33]So I'm going to just say all the bullet point information in 25 seconds.
[06:31.35]So here we go.
[06:35.98]Hey, it's Jerma here.
[06:37.60]Not currently available at the... Hold on a minute.
[06:41.16]I can never do these.
[06:43.02]Even in real... Like, I can't do this shit.
[06:46.58]You ever notice that?
[06:47.90]That anytime you try to leave a voicemail for somebody or set up a voicemail, you do it 500 times and it always sounds wrong every time?
[07:00.13]Hey, you're probably wondering what's going on here.
[07:01.79]Well, my name... Hey there, what's happening here?
[07:04.74]It's Jeremy, Jerma...
[07:07.83]Hey, what's happening?
[07:08.53]It's Jerma here.
[07:09.25]Just want to make sure you're aware of some things going on over the next couple of weeks, the next month or so.
[07:13.15]I'm currently moving to Vegas.
[07:15.13]That's right.
[07:15.83]You're watching this clip.
[07:17.05]I'm not here.
[07:17.78]I'm not there yet.
[07:19.24]Hold on.
[07:22.80]Hey, what's going on?
[07:24.12]It's Jerma here.
[07:25.00]You've probably known me from being in Las Vegas.
[07:27.50]That's not real.
[07:28.14]It hasn't happened yet.
[07:29.02]I do this for like an hour.
[07:30.11]This is going to be the first hour of the stream.
[07:34.97]He's doing the tuber voice.
[07:38.52]He's doing the YouTuber voice.
[07:41.08]Well, that's what you have.
[07:41.72]Everybody, listen to everybody's voicemail.
[07:44.14]Even guys that I know that have these thick Boston accents, right?
[07:48.04]Hey, let me tell you something, fucking Jeremy.
[07:49.84]You want to go down to the fucking store and get a fucking steak and cheese?
[07:52.48]Listen to their voicemail.
[07:54.36]Hello there.
[07:54.84]Hi, my name is David, and I'm sorry I can't make your phone call, but I'll be there in just a moment.

[08:18.77]Well, I'm Jeremy.

[11:23.27]Did anybody get that?
[11:24.19]You got that, right?
[11:26.57]How did I lose this already?
[11:30.99]I lost it already.

[12:19.73]Call.
[12:20.09]Please leave a message after the tone.
[12:24.98]Hey, Jeremy, it's me, Jeremy.
[12:26.18]I just want to make sure that everyone else also realizes, too.
[12:28.53]Sorry, I know you're in Vegas right now.
[12:30.23]But I also am... There's a big project I'm working on that you're going to see here in the next probably two weeks before I leave.
[12:36.61]So I just want to make sure everyone's aware of that.
[12:37.99]Be ready for this fun project that you'll probably see before I go to Las Vegas.
[12:43.65]That's it.
[12:53.92]Alright, we got it.
[12:56.10]We got it.
[12:59.88]The sub just killed it.
[13:04.38]Hold on a minute.
[13:04.86]Let me do this one more time, because I don't want to... Why did I say there's a big project coming?
[13:13.36]That's not even like... That's real, but it's not necessarily real.
[13:17.76]Why am I leaving people on the string here?
[13:20.24]Hold on.
[13:21.46]Oh my fucking god, somebody's subscribing.
[13:25.89]10 tier one subscriptions from your boy thank you so much dude oh my god alright here we go hello I gotta wait for these to pass though
[13:50.01]It doesn't even matter.
[13:50.83]Hey there.
[13:51.58]I'm not available to stream right now because I'm currently moving to Las Vegas.
[13:55.38]Over the next month or so, you're going to see some streams sporadically.
[13:58.90]It's going to be tough.
[13:59.96]So bear with me as I relocate to Las Vegas.
[14:04.38]See you soon.
[14:05.12]Stay tuned.
[14:07.22]Hello.
[14:07.84]No one is available to take your call.
[14:10.12]Please leave a message after the tone.
[14:14.73]Hey, Jeremy, what's up?
[14:15.49]It's Jeremy here.
[14:16.09]Sorry, I know you're in Las Vegas right now.
[14:18.39]But I also want people to make sure that they understand that not only are you going to be gone next week, but you're also going to be gone for like two weeks in the end of September into October.
[14:27.60]That's very important as well.
[14:28.54]You forgot to mention that part.
[14:30.10]Also, hey, we might have a couple of fun streams here.
[14:34.40]Of course we will, because all my streams are fun, right?
[14:38.44]I'll talk to you when you get back.
[14:39.67]Alright, bye.
[14:42.09]I'm done.
[14:42.35]That's it.
[14:42.89]Got it.
[14:49.57]Alright, hey!
[14:52.01]Thanks for hanging out.
[14:54.05]Now let's play, let's play this game that I have.
[15:00.26]Is the audio on?
[15:13.04]I believe, oh yeah it is, we're good.
[15:15.78]So again, I have no idea what this game is going to be about, but all I know is that the resolution is real bad.
[15:21.08]Seems to be... At least the character resolution is.
[15:23.39]But whatever, alright, let's go.
[15:25.65]Hello, Morphine.
[15:26.85]Are you ready to learn the basics?
[15:28.23]Yes.
[15:30.01]Move the controller to... Hold on, it's a motion control game?
[15:34.93]No, wait a minute.
[15:39.99]Oh my god.
[15:41.21]I feel like I have a VR helmet on.
[15:45.34]Actually, I think I kind of like this.
[15:47.22]Do I hate this?
[15:52.56]I mean, I kind of hate this, but... Why makes the camera look in the direction you're moving?
[15:57.27]Okay, so it's a quick turn.
[16:02.83]Use that to follow the path.
[16:05.19]Okay, hold on.
[16:06.17]No, no, no.
[16:07.01]Yeah, there it is.
[16:07.66]Turn it off.
[16:10.80]That's much better.
[16:12.56]Although I need to reduce that sensitivity.
[16:17.16]What's that?
[16:17.56]Better?
[16:20.28]It's alright.
[16:24.20]Alright.
[16:24.40]Remember, use to look left and right.
[16:25.74]Now follow the path.
[16:26.42]That's a quick turnaround.
[16:29.26]What the hell?
[16:29.60]Why are you doing that?
[16:30.16]Alright.
[16:31.14]Use... Why is it letting me turn that way?
[16:36.63]Keep going.
[16:37.57]Just learning the basics here.
[16:38.83]Alright, now... I can't go... Am I too tall to ride this ride?
[16:44.54]Try another way.
[16:45.10]Okay, I'm too big to go in there.
[16:47.04]Yeah, this game's about being big and being small.
[16:49.23]You know, some of us are big and some of us are small.
[16:53.27]An obstacle.
[16:53.75]Press B to jump.
[16:58.79]I can't make it.
[17:00.99]Small legs.
[17:01.49]You'll need to grow your legs to jump higher.
[17:05.48]How?
[17:07.36]Use ZR to shoot at the Morphine's legs.
[17:16.30]Okay, every time you hit an enemy's legs, their shrinks and yours grow.
[17:19.60]Same happens with other body parts.
[17:22.76]Alright, so now I have a little bit longer legs.
[17:25.54]When an enemy's body part reaches minimum size, you can steal more mass from it.
[17:30.28]Also, if one of your body parts is at its maximum size, you can't steal mass for that specific body part.
[17:35.91]Okay.
[17:36.63]Don't worry, you can still damage your enemy even if you can't steal mass.
[17:42.71]I understand, I think.
[17:48.14]Mass.
[17:49.24]Press B to jump over.
[17:50.22]Legs are not the only body part that affects what your morphine can do.
[17:53.94]You'll learn about that after playing a couple of matches.
[17:57.92]Hold B to use your buttocks.
[18:01.06]Why do I have a butt rocket?
[18:04.68]The indicator that appeared when you used it shows the remaining fuel regenerates slowly after you use it.
[18:10.02]Keep going to learn more.
[18:12.30]Pretty good movement.
[18:15.82]Pretty good movement.
[18:17.60]What we have here is going to be difficult to hit.
[18:19.44]Try to kill him with ZR.
[18:28.14]Use R to kill your enemy.
[18:29.69]Oh, this is more than... Nicely done.
[18:33.25]Secondary fire modes have a recharge time.
[18:35.21]The indicator that appeared when you fired R shows that time.
[18:38.81]You'll learn more about weapons later.
[18:41.57]Okay, so I have a... Almost there.
[18:43.67]Just walk through that pipe and you're done.
[18:49.36]You're too big.
[18:50.80]I can't go into the fucking snuffleupagus nose.
[18:53.80]Your size affects which map elements you can use.
[18:55.60]Remember to adapt your strategy to your size.
[18:59.59]I'll disable your weapon and command that morphine to steal some of your mass so that you can fit.
[19:05.83]You almost died.
[19:06.41]See those lights on your spine and the HP bar that appear?
[19:08.85]They show your health.
[19:10.65]Your spine lights will blink and beep when your HP is low, like now.
[19:15.63]Stealing mass from enemies will heal you.
[19:17.22]Steal mass from the enemy now to heal up a little bit.
[19:23.03]There you go.
[19:23.35]Beware if there's no mass left to steal, you'll not heal.
[19:27.71]Well done, Morphy.
[19:29.05]Now that you know the basics and you're small enough, go through the pipe and have some fun.
[19:34.11]Okay.
[19:36.08]Dead space?
[19:37.86]Wait, we're gonna go to the... Alright, that's the basics.
[19:39.88]Let's customize.
[19:41.98]Make your Morphy unique.
[19:42.92]You're gonna have a cool face?
[19:46.32]No, no pre-made faces.
[19:47.16]Um...
[19:53.99]What?
[19:54.53]Oh, no, no, no.
[19:55.37]Edit face.
[19:55.83]Okay, forehead.
[20:01.51]Um... Oh, you can move it around.
[20:07.56]So this is gonna be a mustache?
[20:10.44]Okay, I actually... Now I'm gonna make the dead space guy.
[20:14.80]Right?
[20:15.72]Because everybody wants to see that now.
[20:24.04]Okay, that looks good.
[20:27.36]That looks good.
[20:29.07]Alright, right eye.
[20:36.71]No, that's not correct.
[20:37.43]But that could be his mouth.
[20:43.05]Can he have two of these?
[20:44.67]I think he can have two.
[20:45.43]Alright, nose.
[20:53.87]Can I flip this so it's a heart on his, like, attack?
[20:55.73]Wait, does Isaac have a... His name's Isaac, right?
[21:01.13]Buy more?
[21:01.81]This is not in-game.
[21:04.19]Oh, there is an in-game currency.
[21:05.51]I don't think you can buy anything, though.
[21:13.48]Interesting.
[21:13.90]Alright.
[21:15.26]I hate this game already.
[21:16.54]Why?
[21:17.14]What?
[21:17.78]Where did all my shit go?
[21:25.84]Nah, I'm gonna just do this with fucking double kills, you know?
[21:28.28]Just call me Mr. Double Kill.
[21:33.64]Well, look, I can customize later.
[21:35.04]It doesn't matter.
[21:35.56]Body.
[21:39.24]Reddit.
[21:41.28]Chest.
[21:44.66]That's fine.
[21:46.68]Right arm.
[21:49.23]That looks alright.
[21:51.85]Do his butt.
[21:53.53]I'll do it.
[21:53.91]Don't just... Just wait.
[21:54.83]I'll do his ass in a minute.
[21:56.86]I'm gonna do this like Skull Penis.
[21:58.06]Hold on.
[22:03.42]I don't really have anything.
[22:04.66]I need to play the game first.
[22:10.78]Sure, let's save it.
[22:13.73]Face, body, emotes.
[22:16.71]Intro emote.
[22:17.53]I only got one.
[22:20.69]Where are the dances?
[22:21.53]Where are the Fortnite dances?
[22:24.21]Hey, can you guys add Fortnite dances?
[22:27.45]Alright, that's fine.
[22:28.01]Let's just play.
[22:29.93]I don't have any money, so let's just go steal some mass.
[22:33.96]Offline versus AI.
[22:36.10]The Moki player.
[22:39.24]Quick match.
[22:39.66]Let's just play.
[22:42.60]Do I have a name?
[22:45.88]What is it?
[22:51.57]Oh, it's just Jeremy.
[22:57.21]It's just my first name.
[22:59.01]Okay.
[23:03.66]Looking for morphies.
[23:07.04]I believe it's 4v4.
[23:09.30]Also, I want to make sure I keep this in mind.
[23:11.74]This stream is not going to be very long.
[23:13.80]I have to finish painting my bathroom, and I'm showing the house tomorrow.
[23:17.28]So I have to kind of get on top of it.
[23:21.06]Waiting for the first coat to dry, you know what I mean?
[23:24.94]This is the only people playing the game.
[23:30.11]Those all look like the same map to me.
[23:35.87]House Flipper stream?
[23:36.71]No, I'm not going to stream myself painting.
[23:42.32]Because I'll get too into it and I'll like, I'll try, I'll fuck it up on purpose.
[23:46.63]You know, I'll like add a random weird color.
[23:49.21]My mother was over here earlier and she's like, she picked out the color.
[23:52.31]She's like, hey, this looks good.
[23:53.83]If I fuck it up, my mother comes over.
[23:55.13]You want me to like embarrass myself in front of my mother?
[24:02.84]Jeremy, hold on.
[24:03.78]So why did you paint?
[24:07.20]Why did you paint a giant X on your wall?
[24:09.92]Did you think that was funny?
[24:11.84]Yeah.
[24:13.60]You're not funny.
[24:15.00]And then she'd walk up.
[24:17.31]I can't do that.
[24:22.69]She's used to it at this point.
[24:24.61]Probably.
[24:25.01]Alright, let's go.
[24:30.85]Steal mass from your enemies to grow your avatar.
[24:34.89]Do we have to get shot out of the cannon to win?
[24:36.45]Make sure to have the biggest avatar.
[24:42.59]Yeah, this is just Agar.io, but with guns.
[24:48.37]Alright.
[24:49.29]I think we all have standard weapons?
[24:54.71]Gathering the... Alright, let's go.
[25:00.75]Wait, do... How come they have different sizes?
[25:03.51]Alright, here we go.
[25:04.83]I'm ready.
[25:08.67]We all... Okay, we all have that.
[25:09.73]Hold on.
[25:14.29]Okay.
[25:14.63]A little on the laggy side, but that's alright.
[25:23.80]Okay, I have a really big left arm.
[25:30.56]I just got, like, in the gym for a couple weeks.
[25:33.60]A couple weeks.
[25:34.02]More like a year and a half.
[25:39.69]Holy shit.
[25:40.37]Is that guy huge already?
[25:43.45]No, he's not.
[25:43.87]I think we're winning.
[25:57.01]Come on, get a hit!
[26:01.95]Now I have like a little head.
[26:03.79]Oh god.
[26:04.87]How come that guy's so tiny?
[26:16.88]What is this guy doing?
[26:20.26]10 minute stream!
[26:21.66]Hold on, not yet.
[26:22.96]Don't call that yet.
[26:23.86]I got a kill right there, man.
[26:30.05]Somebody's gonna hit me over here.
[26:36.83]How do we keep growing?
[26:37.83]I thought we were gonna grow huge.
[26:39.21]That was just in the trailer?
[26:40.19]Is that like trailer bait?
[26:41.49]This guy over here?
[26:42.19]No, right?
[26:56.71]Can I?
[26:57.24]No, I can't die.
[27:03.35]It's just Latune, but not good.
[27:12.14]Bad aim.
[27:12.82]Hold on, let me try the motion controls.
[27:14.24]I feel like I can do a little bit better with these.
[27:17.20]I think so.
[27:21.13]I mean, some of you guys are going to throw up, but I'm sorry.
[27:22.81]Hold on, this guy turned into like a Metroid.
[27:33.51]Dude, that guy's so small.
[27:34.69]I want to be small.
[27:37.11]It's better to be like that.
[27:44.38]Use R?
[27:44.74]Yeah, it's like your... When do I pick up new weapons?
[27:50.06]I'm going to go this way.
[27:54.02]I think I just hurt myself.
[28:05.17]Is he going this way?
[28:06.69]This is very laggy.
[28:09.99]I mean, the game did just come out.
[28:12.11]Like, yesterday.
[28:12.91]So, I'm not gonna lie.
[28:31.95]I would rather put my hand in a blender than use these motion controls anymore.
[28:39.37]But we're not going to.
[28:45.23]Get the little guy!
[28:47.12]Get the little guy!
[28:47.76]He's got like 2 HP!
[28:48.42]Get him!
[29:00.41]How do we- can we only grow this much?
[29:06.10]I think we won.
[29:07.38]All you do is just get like a little bit bigger of an arm.
[29:12.14]This is the shit I saw in the trailer!
[29:14.84]I thought you could get to be this big and like beat each other up and shit.
[29:30.75]Hold on, don't use your judgement yet here.
[29:39.64]Look at those huge Kingdom Hearts feet.
[29:46.16]It's like Sora shoes.
[29:47.64]Alright, is that it?
[30:02.21]Wait, hold on, we got some new stuff in the store!
[30:06.06]Specs.
[30:06.76]So you guys didn't think there was going to be more.
[30:08.42]Hold on.
[30:10.96]Every part of your body part has specific stuff.
[30:12.58]Additionally, each body part has a special plugin.
[30:15.46]Plugins are affected by the size of the body part.
[30:17.14]You'll unlock new plugins.
[30:19.78]So the chest.
[30:21.45]Got hands.
[30:23.03]Alright, we have some new chest stuff.
[30:25.79]Hold on, what the hell is that?
[30:28.03]Put up a barrier that stops all projectiles coming in or out.
[30:31.84]Chest size affects the size and duration of the bubble as well as the slow effect on enemies.
[30:36.81]Okay, so that's what I got on now.
[30:43.67]Quick Batch again.
[30:47.77]Don't put your reservations out there yet.
[30:55.50]No, no.
[31:00.40]That 30 minute stream hey guys welcome to the stream that was 30 fucking minutes Host disconnected Am I gonna play fortnight no, I'm gonna play fortnight I
[31:31.81]It's alright.
[31:32.27]I got a backup game on the Switch.
[31:34.27]You didn't think I was prepared?
[31:36.35]I got a backup game that I don't like, but I will play it for like a little bit if I have to.
[31:44.68]No, it is not GeoGuessr.
[31:46.06]It's not going to be GeoGuessr.
[31:48.74]It's Super Mario Presents Tennis Super All-Star.
[31:53.70]And I don't like it at all.
[31:54.54]I want to return it, but I can't.
[31:59.83]I bought that instead of Breath of the Wild and I'm upset about it.
[32:04.41]I had a screen that had Breath of the Wild and Mario Tennis on it.
[32:11.57]And I bought Mario Tennis instead.
[32:19.62]I don't know why I did that.
[32:20.68]I don't know.
[32:26.42]Mario Tennis is not a bad game, it's just I don't know what I was expecting.
[32:31.09]You can't go into Mario Tennis thinking you're going to get anything besides Mario Tennis.
[32:35.55]Oh my god, this really is dead at launch, isn't it?
[32:48.04]Looking for fucking normies.
[32:50.06]Where are they?
[32:50.56]Where are the mormies?
[32:51.38]Where are the mormies?
[32:52.50]Ugh.
[33:01.24]This game should be free.
[33:05.97]This game's $20.
[33:13.54]It's $20.
[33:16.74]I could have bought the Breath of the Wild Collector's Edition.
[33:20.60]I bought Mario Tennis and the fucking Mormons.
[33:27.37]I bought Morbis and Mario Tennis.
[33:30.37]I could have got the little figure of the little Dodongo.
[33:34.77]Could have done it.
[33:38.33]Is it a $20 joke?
[33:39.35]It was never meant to be a joke.
[33:40.43]It was meant to be like I thought I was going to play this and think it was fun.
[33:50.20]I think the concept is there.
[33:51.24]It's definitely interesting.
[33:54.90]No one has done a thing where you shoot to grow.
[33:58.09]But I didn't know it was shoot to grow only a little bit.
[34:03.03]That's what it should be, the tag should be.
[34:05.47]Shoot to grow, just a little bit though.
[34:13.70]Don't get fu- I'm not going to play Fortnite.
[34:17.58]I'll put my other hand in the blender.
[34:21.00]I got rid of both my hands.
[34:22.05]So, no.
[34:31.52]You said that about PUBG, but I played the PUBG mobile game.
[34:35.48]That's not even the real one.
[34:39.00]Why is there a ladder on that guy?
[34:43.98]Wait, hold on.
[34:44.26]This is different.
[34:51.41]Fortnite's not a bad game.
[34:52.85]I'm not... I didn't say Fortnite was a bad game.
[34:54.47]I just said I didn't want to play it and I would rather put my hand in a blender.
[34:59.01]That's not me saying the game is bad.
[35:00.61]That's just...
[35:02.37]I mean... It's Payload.
[35:06.95]Alright.
[35:12.17]How is Fortnite over the line?
[35:13.61]I played PUBG Mobile.
[35:14.87]Because that was like a one and done, like, joke.
[35:19.38]I didn't mean for that to be taken seriously.
[35:21.66]I like the hit sound, though.
[35:28.82]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[35:34.10]Alright, the shield is ZL.
[35:35.95]Can I shoot out of the shield?
[35:43.61]What's going on?
[35:49.10]Come here, you.
[35:51.64]Come here, Mythbusters.
[36:01.77]Got him.
[36:06.86]One soul aiming.
[36:08.06]There we go.
[36:11.36]Play the objective?
[36:12.04]No, I'm the rusher, man.
[36:15.95]I'm the jungler.
[36:16.51]I have to go around and get gags.
[36:19.19]I gotta gag these guys.
[36:20.21]I have a really big chest right now.
[36:29.56]Oh, it's slippery.
[36:30.26]I get it.
[36:33.14]How far do you slide?
[36:34.98]Why am I still sliding?
[36:36.43]What's wrong with my guy?
[36:37.47]I don't have any legs.
[36:40.65]I'm on fire.
[36:41.43]How am I on fire?
[36:46.07]What's wrong with me?
[36:54.22]Why am I permanently dancing?
[37:01.37]I have no idea what's going on.
[37:02.39]Oh, it's just oil everywhere.
[37:03.53]I get it.
[37:03.81]It's like an environmental thing.
[37:14.95]Great value.
[37:18.49]I don't even know where those went.
[37:26.61]Is this game like 720p or am I crazy?
[37:29.49]I feel like it is.
[37:35.54]Maybe not, just something about the textures looks a little odd.
[37:41.79]You got big ass hands?
[37:42.87]Yep.
[37:45.17]Keep going, we're almost there.
[37:45.91]Watch out for the oil.
[37:52.63]Yeah, it's 20 bucks.
[37:54.93]Apparently this is coming to steam at some point.
[37:57.05]I don't know when that is, but it is.
[37:58.83]If anybody cares.
[38:10.99]I'm doing kind of well.
[38:15.64]I think I found my game, man.
[38:24.78]Dude, I think I found my fucking niche.
[38:35.46]Get on it.
[38:40.76]Get on the cot!
[38:41.40]Get on the cot!
[38:50.84]What was that, 10 kills?
[38:51.68]Is he healing?
[38:55.21]I need to heal.
[38:57.07]No, no, I got beat by Bot Buster.
[38:59.73]I think it looked like he was put together with parts that don't belong together.
[39:07.21]Team is winning.
[39:11.59]Can I get in that?
[39:14.09]Look at my little baby hands.
[39:16.55]Why can't you grow bigger?
[39:18.13]You should be able to be a tiny little speck on the map.
[39:23.29]I'm not playing against bots.
[39:24.21]Look at how big I am.
[39:35.96]Those are bots.
[39:36.98]Those are not bots.
[39:39.27]You think that the developers would put that guy's name in this?
[39:42.07]That's a bot.
[39:42.51]Are you serious?
[39:43.89]Alright, I'm level 2.
[40:00.27]What's wrong with Evan?
[40:05.29]play Fortnite I'm not gonna play Fortnite sorry your dreams won't come true tonight I'm not gonna play Fortnite I don't even know how to play it alright you want me to play Fortnite you want me to throw my stream into the giant box of other Fortnite streams all I would be doing would be I would be adding I'd be though I'd be one grain of sugar being added to the cookie mix in the bowl of cookies
[40:36.51]No, God damn it.
[40:37.13]I want to beat the goddamn box.
[40:49.22]Play it for the... I'm not going to say that, but play it for fun.
[41:05.79]Play Doom.
[41:07.49]Is Doom even on the Switch?
[41:17.68]Doom is like 60 gigabytes.
[41:21.40]The Switch can't even handle 60 gigabytes.
[41:23.82]I have to go put it on like a thumb drive.
[41:33.17]Just delete the game.
[41:34.49]This one?
[41:34.87]Hold on.
[41:36.85]We're gonna do... That's headhunt.
[41:39.02]Let's do... Mass Heist.
[41:50.90]60 gigs.
[41:55.33]Go play P-Cross.
[41:56.89]I actually am pretty good at P-Cross.
[41:58.13]I could play P-Cross.
[42:01.51]I really could.
[42:03.03]But I think everyone would probably leave.
[42:18.82]Instead of now, like people leaving now, we're already leaving.
[42:23.98]Yeah, you know, I'm pretty good at puzzles.
[42:25.28]I am.
[42:25.78]I'm good at Picross.
[42:30.21]Load plug-in.
[42:33.04]Got it.
[42:33.30]Alright, this is third time's a charm.
[42:44.03]We at least have to play three rounds before I give up on the damn thing.
[42:56.96]We'll play Excitebite.
[42:59.70]What else is on the Switch?
[43:00.76]I just don't want you guys to see my credit card number.
[43:09.71]You know, a really funny joke right now would be for me to play the Attack on Titan intro theme and like jump around and do this.
[43:15.82]That would be very funny, but I don't have the patience for that right now.
[43:20.20]Like, wouldn't you guys think that'd be funny?
[43:28.56]Ravids and Mario in XCOM.
[43:31.97]They put Mario in XCOM?
[43:33.83]No, they didn't.
[43:38.43]That wouldn't make any sense.
[43:42.20]They did.
[43:44.30]So you're telling me that you can shoot Mario with like a gun in XCOM?
[43:51.33]Well, that's not real.
[44:01.93]Jerma confirmed living under a rock.
[44:03.67]I just got the switch like two weeks ago.
[44:06.79]I haven't been following with what the switches came out with.
[44:15.54]This funny haha spikes in this game.
[44:18.50]Why?
[44:30.20]Funny haha spike.
[44:32.26]No, like I'm talking not that way.
[44:38.75]Look, all I care about at this moment, I want to shoot everybody's legs and I want to turn into a turkey.
[44:42.28]That's all I care about.
[44:45.60]I don't give a shit about anything else.
[44:50.64]This game is worth $20 if I turn into a turkey.
[45:01.18]Shit.
[45:02.30]I'm almost there.
[45:02.98]Come on.
[45:03.30]I have a tiny head and everything.
[45:04.56]What?
[45:07.66]I got big bits.
[45:10.00]Thank you, Scripps3, for the $50.
[45:11.81]Thank you so much, Scripps.
[45:14.59]Really appreciate it, dude.
[45:15.31]Just play Mario Odyssey or Deponia.
[45:21.63]Mario Odyssey is such a great game, too, isn't it?
[45:24.44]Thank you, Scripps, for the $3.00.
[45:32.97]Let's reminisce about how fun Mario Galaxy is.
[45:36.07]While I play.
[45:38.65]I don't even- I forget the name of this game.
[45:42.11]Zoom?
[45:43.77]Is it called Zoom?
[45:50.34]Morphies.
[45:51.10]Oh, that's what it is.
[45:51.70]Okay.
[45:52.84]I don't know why I thought it was called Zoomies or something.
[45:54.90]Or Zuma.
[45:56.20]But that's another game.
[45:57.68]Zoomies is what your dog does when he takes a shit and comes inside.
[46:15.75]That game's fun, too.
[46:23.84]Alright, can we stop talking about games that are fun?
[46:25.74]I'm busy trying to play this one.
[46:28.88]Don't worry.
[46:29.92]Just give it a minute.
[46:35.70]Mario Odyssey is lame and you have a child's brain if you think it's anything more than a mediocre platformer.
[46:41.57]Holy shit, man.
[46:44.21]Holy shit.
[46:48.35]Oh my god.
[46:58.38]Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets.
[47:02.34]Why are they playing that?
[47:03.90]Is that the song they're playing?
[47:21.70]I got... I grew up.
[47:25.77]Why do I still hear the machine gun sound?
[47:29.77]Alright, we're gonna make our own weapons.
[47:38.68]Yeah, guys, I'm sorry.
[47:39.70]Like, look, I didn't have very much of a plan today.
[47:41.52]I've been breathing in paint fumes, and I thought this was a good idea.
[47:44.14]After, like, four hours, five hours of paint fumes, I'm just like, you know what?
[47:49.83]Let's play that.
[47:50.39]Let's do that.
[47:50.89]It's good.
[47:57.51]Wait, I can make my own weapon?
[48:06.85]Can you throw a punch?
[48:09.19]like what select any of the posters in the loader to make a weapon okay so this is the ratata pentazooka and what can I do with this time to make a weapon weapons have two parts that you can combine at will the base part is mostly focused on damage where the other part can help with different strategies unlock new weapons as part as you level up move the wheels select the two parts to make a weapon
[48:38.89]Okay, so this is the Rattata.
[48:41.41]I only have a Rattata.
[48:44.65]And a Slippery Splat.
[48:45.71]That's all I can do.
[48:51.65]So it looks like we're gonna do slip- Why cover everything in paint when you can cover it in oil?
[48:55.22]It's a little callback to Splatoon.
[48:58.72]Slippery for enemies, but speedy for friendlies, and it heals them too.
[49:01.40]So this is a heal.
[49:02.04]Let's make it.
[49:04.38]Rattata, Slippery Splat.
[49:08.87]Because loadout was so successful.
[49:13.07]Yeah, but... Wait, we got pinatas?
[49:18.25]This actually is Fortnite.
[49:28.08]I don't know what this is.
[49:33.50]Did I actually just unlock...
[49:39.52]I got a rare face.
[49:40.52]Alright, put it on.
[49:42.36]And I'll put on the beanbag Sonic as well.
[49:46.52]I got more piñatas, hold on.
[49:47.66]I have another rare face.
[49:54.86]That looks like me?
[49:59.28]How do I get more piñatas?
[50:01.70]Buy a piñata.
[50:03.66]One piñata is 9, 9500.
[50:04.41]Widgets.
[50:09.52]You've got to be kidding me.
[50:10.30]That's too much.
[50:20.67]Yo, can we have a 100 pinata opening stream?
[50:25.23]Oh, God.
[50:32.84]What would you do if I actually did that?
[50:37.61]Is there a single player campaign?
[50:38.95]No.
[50:39.97]There's not.
[50:41.23]There's also only four maps.
[50:48.90]Leave this game.
[50:50.94]Just hold on.
[50:53.06]Somebody donate him enough money for pinatas.
[50:54.80]There's no in-game purchases in this game.
[50:57.10]You do it with, uh... Alright, look.
[51:03.08]Let's be like... Be nice, though.
[51:05.30]Alright.
[51:06.71]Alright.
[51:09.09]You don't have to be so mean about it.
[51:12.13]I mean, how about you say in the chat, you know what, this game just isn't for me, right?
[51:17.30]The game that you're currently playing right now, I just don't think it's for me, streamer.
[51:20.40]This game, it just isn't for anyone.
[51:37.12]No.
[51:39.82]Stop it.
[51:41.50]I always like feel bad about this shit, man.
[51:47.42]It's an interesting concept.
[51:48.60]It's just you kind of baited me with the trailer here.
[52:02.91]The game that you're currently playing right now, I don't think it's for me, Screamer.
[52:05.59]Hey, thanks.
[52:06.77]I understand.
[52:07.67]I get that.
[52:20.13]This will be the last one, and then we have to... You know, I'll tell you what I have on the Switch.
[52:25.21]I have Binding of Isaac on the Switch.
[52:27.53]I have Super Mario, um... Whatever the hell it's called.
[52:31.53]Do I not paint the ground with this?
[52:44.55]Oh, like that.
[52:48.67]Can I hurt people with this?
[52:52.45]Nope.
[52:56.46]Play Binding of Isaac.
[53:01.86]Do I have Minecraft Switch Edition?
[53:03.70]I do not have Minecraft on the Switch.
[53:05.72]Why would I do that?
[53:06.42]I have Mario Tennis.
[53:18.06]This is good going.
[53:30.32]Get Skyrim on the Switch.
[53:32.84]No, I would get Skyrim- I have Skyrim on PC already.
[53:35.12]Why would I do that?
[53:41.25]This is just a control point?
[53:43.41]I guess?
[53:45.11]This is a heal, isn't it?
[53:54.41]Todd demands it.
[53:57.47]He's not here.
[54:00.22]Okay, if Todd comes into this chat right now and demands I play Skyrim with a $5,000 bit message and him holding a sign on his Twitter that says, it's me, I just did that, Jeremy.
[54:15.51]Like a Reddit AMA.
[54:16.69]Then I will play Skyrim right now.
[54:25.92]I am Todd.
[54:28.64]He just did it!
[54:30.97]What the way?!
[54:37.19]That's your cue.
[54:41.86]Didn't you make this joke during the Get Over It stream?
[54:45.66]Probably with a different developer.
[54:49.40]You know, it's a timeless reference.
[54:56.22]Well, that was weird.
[54:58.81]He's always recycling jokes.
[55:03.39]I am joke conscious, guys.
[55:10.74]You gotta recycle the joke.
[55:13.44]Eventually, you know, you gotta be environmentally joke conscious.
[55:17.88]I don't know what that's doing.
[55:29.11]I didn't hit anybody.
[55:33.12]Recycled Germicraft.
[55:34.76]That's something that you'll never see everywhere again.
[55:38.14]Alright, that guy res- there's somebody in the chat that's resident sleeper.
[55:40.98]I- I'm trying to move on.
[55:43.62]I think- I just put someone to sleep.
[55:45.28]That's what that means, right?
[55:46.54]I gotta get out of here.
[55:48.41]I gotta do something else.
[55:56.09]Resident sleeping.
[55:57.15]Yes, he was resident sleeping.
[56:04.18]We only have 20 more seconds of this.
[56:05.54]Just stay here.
[56:07.42]Just wait till you see the next game we play.
[56:09.25]I thought that guy's name was Todd.
[56:15.83]What's his name?
[56:18.55]Todd?
[56:19.11]What's his last name?
[56:21.46]Todd Harris.
[56:23.46]Harold.
[56:24.12]What's his name?
[56:27.18]Todd Howard.
[56:27.98]What did I say?
[56:28.82]Todd?
[56:29.48]Isn't Todd... Todd Harris is an actor.
[56:36.12]No, that's Ed Harris.
[56:37.70]Ed Harris is an actor.
[56:42.68]That could be... Rubbers.
[56:50.49]That was 20 seconds, you fucker.
[56:51.77]Turn it off.
[57:08.42]Mario Tennis... Robot.
[57:13.78]Where you can build Binding of Isaac, Hand of Fate, and Original Overcooked.
