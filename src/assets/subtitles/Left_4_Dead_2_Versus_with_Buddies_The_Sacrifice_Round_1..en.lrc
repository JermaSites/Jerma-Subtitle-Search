[00:07.21]Hey, what's up, everybody?
[00:10.30]We are doing some Left 4 Dead here with the group from Method Gaming.
[00:15.02]We've got, of course, Burgah Boy here, even though he's not in Method.
[00:19.14]But we've got Roxy, Boo, and Stealth in the call, so introduce yourselves, people.
[00:24.17]Hi, baby.
[00:26.60]Hello.
[00:27.00]Steph, what about you?
[00:28.94]You're like in this game right now.
[00:29.76]I'm like watching American Horror Story right now.
[00:31.58]What am I doing?
[00:32.32]I mean, I'm playing Left 4 Dead.
[00:33.92]Yeah.
[00:34.20]Why did I just do that?
[00:35.10]It's like go kill zombies.
[00:36.98]I'm like in the game with you guys.
[00:40.46]Well, I have a question.
[00:41.40]When I pound someone with a hunter and I'm clawing away, how do I like do more damage with my claws?
[00:46.81]It just does it automatically.
[00:48.21]Oh, I thought you could, like, tap a button and it would do it, like, more vigorously.
[00:52.55]Yeah, you gotta, like, hold L and R and you have to, like, tap A as fast as you can.
[00:57.34]That's, like, how you, like, capture the Pok√©mon faster.
[01:00.56]Did you say hold L and R?
[01:02.32]Yeah.
[01:03.24]This is on the PC there, buddy.
[01:05.38]Oh, yeah, forgot.
[01:07.58]Alright, let's make a little bit of a plan here.
[01:11.16]So Burgah Boy's going that way.
[01:13.04]Don't let Burgah Boy get out, like, around the corner.
[01:15.54]That's, like, the main plan.
[01:16.74]I'm gonna go, like, this way.
[01:20.81]Yeah, like, stealth.
[01:21.49]You do them.
[01:23.35]I'm, like, sneaking up on these guys.
[01:24.55]They don't even, like, know.
[01:25.65]What are you guys spawning in as right now?
[01:27.05]What are you, Roxy?
[01:27.59]I don't know.
[01:28.55]I'm a hunter.
[01:29.37]Okay, because they're, like, trashing us right now.
[01:33.01]I am in the worst of ways.
[01:34.13]I am a boomer stuck behind a fence.
[01:35.67]This is a disaster.
[01:36.79]Oh, if you can boom one of them, try and boom somebody.
[01:39.60]Because I'll be able to launch on somebody right now.
[01:42.02]I'm too close.
[01:42.90]Oh, I missed!
[01:44.14]Oh, come on.
[01:44.80]Boom somebody.
[01:45.40]I'm waiting for the opportunity to do it.
[01:46.82]Did you get someone?
[01:48.40]I'm a get Burgah Boy.
[01:49.34]Oh, shit.
[01:51.07]Oh, sugar.

[01:59.73]Oh, what do you know about that one right there?
[02:03.67]That was a sick pounce.
[02:05.91]That was a sick pounce.
[02:07.01]That was really cool.
[02:09.07]There's an old man.
[02:09.95]Let's get him.
[02:10.77]Get Grandpa.
[02:14.09]Get away from me.
[02:15.79]Alright.

[02:20.94]Hold on.
[02:24.18]I'm going to wait for one of you guys to spawn.
[02:25.94]I'm not going to just jump in there.

[06:04.55]I figured I'd try and do something.
[06:08.41]Did they get in?
[06:09.29]This isn't the safe room, though.
[06:11.29]No, they got around the corner.
[06:13.28]As soon as they jump down, there's the safe room.
[06:15.69]Alright, well, alright, Boo, you gotta go for a boom.
[06:17.81]I'm gonna try and catch somebody with this.
[06:19.21]Can you spawn inside still, or is that glitched out anymore?
[06:22.79]Uh, I don't know.
[06:23.23]To be honest, I don't know.
[06:24.27]Just waiting for somebody to drop.

[06:46.00]That's a nasty piece of work.
[06:48.08]That's the safe room right there.
[06:49.12]They made it.
[06:50.69]Can we just totally screw them right now?
[06:52.71]I'll take them all out.
[06:53.85]I love Lewis' scream.
[06:58.75]Look at Bird Boy.
[06:59.67]No!
[07:00.63]Yeah, they got it.
[07:01.71]They beat it.
[07:03.19]Alright, well... Get ditched, Lewis.
[07:05.66]There's no zombies around.
[07:08.60]They just left.
[07:10.14]Well... How long do they beat it in?
[07:15.14]I don't know.
[07:15.51]I don't think it's... I'm not sure.
[07:19.45]We've got to do better.
