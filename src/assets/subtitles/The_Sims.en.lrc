[00:02.90]It's only so fast you can move with a full hot coffee in your hand.
[00:07.19]I have a hot coffee.
[00:12.71]I was downstairs.
[00:18.07]And my staircase, by the way, is like eight stories.
[00:24.77]I have to go around the fucking pool.
[00:27.62]God, that's annoying.
[00:30.17]Over by the playground, the slide that goes down from the top floor all the way to the bottom.
[00:33.59]I don't know why I made it like this.
[00:38.65]Can't use the elevator because it's out of service.
[00:41.63]That's fucking annoying.
[00:45.25]Like a Willy Wonka house.
[00:47.70]Yeah, but it's only so fast.
[00:49.70]I'm half-winded because I had to move so quickly up the stairs.
[00:52.60]My eight-story house.

[03:41.68]Alright, it's been a very long time.
[03:43.13]I can't, I'm very excited to play The Sims 1 with all of you.
[03:47.01]How you feeling?
[03:50.61]I am very tight, very sore.
[03:52.67]Did some stuff this week.
[03:54.79]Did some medical stuff this week, and we tried something new.
[04:00.52]And I kind of, I kind of got like the shit kicked out of me, if I'm honest with you.
[04:08.45]Essentially, I did the equivalent of lying down on the ground and somebody just slowly running me over with their car.
[04:16.28]That's kind of how it feels.
[04:22.34]Just very slowly.
[04:23.99]Just the wheel going up over my back.
[04:27.45]And then all the way across and then over.
[04:29.69]And you see the shock absorption of the car.
[04:31.63]It goes like boom, boom.
[04:36.30]Sounds nice.
[04:37.92]Well that I didn't do that.
[04:38.84]That's what it felt.
[04:39.74]That's what it feels like right now He's doing suedo science for his pain No, I would have to make a YouTube video where I explain that See you don't need but guys with the the tire tracks.
[04:56.76]They have the groove that fits right into where your spine is and what happens is it unlocks an area and
[05:04.14]Right in your T6.
[05:05.46]T7.
[05:08.38]The guy lies down.
[05:13.34]On his face down.
[05:14.14]Just with his head down.
[05:16.46]He's talking into the ground.
[05:18.03]And his microphone's going like... Because he's moving around too much.
[05:23.39]He said, the car's gonna... The car's gonna drive over me, Nuffs.
[05:28.21]You hear like all these horrible crunches.
[05:29.73]Well, it's like the dude's mom.
[05:32.46]Hanging out the window.
[05:34.33]Hey, are you sure you want to do this?
[05:37.53]I don't think this is safe.
[05:46.96]He died.
[05:47.56]No, he didn't.
[05:49.18]You said suedo wrong.
[05:50.68]No, I say suedo.
[05:51.84]Look.
[05:53.60]I like it.
[05:54.06]It sounds fun to me.
[05:57.90]I like the way it sounds better.
[06:00.02]Sway-to-science.
[06:01.34]Pseudo-science sounds, I don't know, like real.
[06:03.64]Sway-to-science sounds... I don't know.
[06:06.75]I like the way it sounds better.
[06:08.49]It was Peter Griffin.
[06:09.55]Look, look, I know, I know.
[06:10.97]I'm from New England and I have a New England accent.
[06:13.81]And I'm like, I've turned into like a fat guy.
[06:15.65]I wear glasses and I eat like fucking Cheetos and I have a dog, okay?
[06:19.39]I may as well be Peter Griffin.
[06:20.37]I do a lot of referential humor too.
[06:21.59]It must be Peter Griffin.
[06:22.51]I am.
[06:22.75]Alright, let's play this then.
[06:28.68]You hurt?
[06:28.88]You guys ready?
[06:32.23]You guys ready?
[06:34.75]Oh, shit, hold on.
[06:37.23]Here we go.
[06:39.49]This is kind of loud for me.
[06:43.35]And... Ta-da!
[06:46.66]Here we are in Sims 1.
[06:50.48]Oh, this was a pain in the ass to get to work.
[06:52.08]To get this to be on your screen...
[06:57.01]I don't know why it was the hardest thing I've ever done.
[07:03.03]So, I have to make a family.
[07:04.84]And I know you can go into the bitmap editor and stuff.
[07:07.42]But I don't want to do it.
[07:09.22]I want to play with just the default sim.
[07:12.50]It's 180p.
[07:13.54]Yeah, well the game broadcasted itself to your screen in like 360p.
[07:20.95]This isn't the one for the NES.
[07:22.21]They really didn't.
[07:24.85]Is the Goth family, for those who don't remember.
[07:26.45]Alright, let's make a family.
[07:31.53]Making a family in The Sims 1 does not take very long at all.
[07:36.13]Oh shit, this is important.
[07:38.89]Oh, what last name?
[07:39.77]What do you think?
[07:47.35]Sweets.
[07:51.80]Sweets family.
[07:54.92]I don't know why I think that's cool.
[07:55.84]The sweets.
[07:56.72]I like it, actually.
[07:57.54]Not the Elberthens, no.
[08:03.24]The Gryffins.
[08:03.78]I'm not making the Gryffin thing.
[08:05.54]You can't even make that.
[08:12.53]Greens.
[08:13.37]The Andes.
[08:14.27]No.
[08:17.11]You want me to make Andy?
[08:18.75]No, it's gotta be new.
[08:20.99]New characters.
[08:21.72]New characters.
[08:24.99]How about the gaslighters?
[08:29.41]Uh... Sway- The Swaydos?
[08:42.70]Swaydos.
[08:43.48]Swaydoos?
[08:44.18]The Swaydoos.
[08:45.56]That's way too, like, that's too comedic.
[08:57.27]I don't know.
[08:57.79]I don't know what's jumping out to me.
[08:59.31]It's Arthur Sweet.
[09:01.21]Arthur Sweets.
[09:01.73]I don't know why.
[09:03.23]That's doing it for me today.
[09:06.05]Arthur Sweets.
[09:08.81]Arthur and Jane Sweets.
[09:11.55]I got it.
[09:16.95]How do I do this?
[09:21.19]Okay, this is Arthur Sweets.
[09:25.93]I forgot that The Sims 1 was... This is it.
[09:28.79]You just make people... You give them, like, a head, and then you change their t-shirt.
[09:35.55]I forgot how little it was in this game.
[09:38.19]You can go in and paint stuff, right?
[09:39.89]Like a Minecraft character, but I'm not gonna do that.
[09:46.69]There's so many... Alright, so let's go with Arthur's Suite here.
[09:49.12]This is scripted.
[09:54.68]Um...
[09:58.05]What are you talking about?
[10:02.29]Make him the Joker.
[10:03.59]That's the Joker's name?
[10:06.62]No, it's not.
[10:07.48]What's the Joker's name in the Joker?
[10:09.22]Arthur what?
[10:13.00]Arthur Fleck.
[10:14.38]It's not Arthur Sweets.
[10:18.86]Just because somebody's name is Arthur doesn't mean they're the Joker.
[10:23.11]Alright.
[10:23.73]Let's do, uh... Let's get it like this.
[10:27.21]Let's do outgoing.
[10:28.77]We want a lot of friends.
[10:31.89]Not active at all.
[10:34.82]And very neat because I don't like it when they throw this shit on the ground.
[10:40.34]Well, how can you be outgoing and not nice?
[10:42.20]Outgoing and not nice or playful?
[10:46.30]Is there like mean outgoing?
[10:48.16]I thought outgoing meant you actively wanted people to be your friend and stuff.
[10:53.38]Is outgoing evil, like, you just... Is that the guy that, like, talks shit to you and cuts you off and stuff?
[11:00.05]Is that the guy that, like, cuts you in the ice cream line and, like, gives you the finger?
[11:02.71]That's, like, a different kind of outgoing.
[11:03.99]You're outgoingly mean.
[11:05.13]Alright, well, no.
[11:06.21]I don't want that.
[11:11.46]That's fine.
[11:11.92]I don't want to be that neat.
[11:15.76]I don't want to be that nice, either.
[11:20.24]Alright, that looks good.
[11:21.96]Arthur Sweets.
[11:22.86]Bio for Arthur Sweets.
[11:23.78]Okay.
[11:43.23]That's Arthur Sweets.

[14:40.10]Why does everybody have so many hashtags in their fucking thing now?
[14:43.60]Everybody's doing this now.
[14:55.51]I'm like a scientist.
[15:06.73]Wait till people start doing this.
[15:10.31]Okay, that looks good to me.
[15:19.92]Alright, it looks good to me.

[15:59.59]Alright, hold on.
[16:02.51]What if... Oh my god.
[16:05.51]It's perfect.
[16:06.87]It's absolutely perfect.
[16:08.81]It's gonna be... It's perfect.
[16:14.65]Not Meg, no.
[16:18.89]Caramel Sweets!
[16:23.14]And I'm not changing anything.
[16:24.62]It's perfect.
[16:38.54]Caramel Sweets.
[16:40.04]Not Martha Sweets.
[16:40.85]Caramel Sweets.
[16:42.77]Not Meg.
[16:43.55]Stop saying Meg.
[16:44.33]You guys hate Family Guy.
[16:45.45]Nobody here likes Family Guy.
[16:48.48]I know why we ironically hate it all together, right?
[16:51.08]But like, I'm not gonna make every character like Peter and like Lois and like Chris Griffin.
[17:06.47]That's where Virgo is?
[17:09.27]Wait, hold on.
[17:09.77]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
[17:10.81]I gotta see if this is accurate.
[17:15.98]That's not accurate at all.
[17:23.52]Yeah, that's more accurate.
[17:24.32]Alright.
[17:26.27]I'm way... That's me.
[17:30.87]Yeah, that's me.
[17:32.79]That's me!
[17:33.19]People are giving so many subs.
[17:36.05]What the fuck is going on?
[17:37.73]ReadyDroid just gave 50 community subs.
[17:39.81]50.
[17:40.59]On top of like the 8,000 he's given in the last two or three years.
[17:43.17]Holy shit, dude.
[17:45.21]Absolute disrespect of what?
[17:50.12]I didn't say Virgo's stupid.
[17:52.52]I said Virgo's not me.
[17:53.88]I said that's inaccurate.
[17:55.88]I didn't say that's dumb.
[18:00.29]Thank you, Freddy.
[18:00.91]Seriously.
[18:02.75]There was a shitload more.
[18:03.71]Unionizer Workplace, Georgie Porgy, Knights of Old, Straight Pube, and Hole of One Zombie.
[18:11.39]Thanks, guys.
[18:13.77]A lot of subs.
[18:14.25]It's not pre-recorded.
[18:15.23]No, it's not.
[18:16.03]It's not pre-recorded.
[18:17.10]I'm here.
[18:17.42]I'm literally in front of you right now.
[18:20.58]What time were you born?
[18:22.34]I don't want to answer that fucking weird question.
[18:27.00]Because you're going to go back in time.
[18:28.82]And here's the thing.
[18:31.63]What if you go back in time and snatch me when I'm a baby or something?
[18:35.23]I don't want you to know what time that was.
[18:43.70]If you go back in time to the day that I was born, and you go to the hospitals where you think I was born, you still need to know the time.
[18:51.46]I ain't telling you that.
[18:52.62]Good luck.
[19:00.39]What was the temperature when you were born?
[19:04.55]You know what's funny?
[19:05.11]That probably actually matters.
[19:07.33]Somehow.
[19:09.82]That's gonna be, like, what if my ice sign is, right?
[19:12.35]Like, it'd be, like, fire or ice.
[19:13.95]I wouldn't be surprised.
[19:17.33]Okay.
[19:17.99]What is, uh, what's this bar for?
[19:19.07]I don't know.
[19:26.18]I don't care.
[19:26.56]Alright, we have Arthur Jane and Caramel Sweets.
[19:30.98]I don't think we need anybody else.
[19:32.75]When you have more than three Sims in a Sims game, that's how you start to lose interest because everybody has to be taken care of and you can't pay attention to anybody.
[19:39.95]So half the people end up like dying and shit because you don't even focus on one person.
[19:47.81]So where are they going to go?
[19:51.24]Are you sure?
[19:51.82]I am sure you're a Sims expert.
[19:58.15]They're the suites.
[19:58.75]They have $20,000 and they're going to move that family.
[20:02.24]Alright, should I buy a lot or should I just kick out somebody?
[20:05.80]This is a starter home.
[20:13.65]Sims 1 is notoriously hard and bad with the file meters.
[20:16.47]Get a good house?
[20:24.16]um this is pet Paradise how about 10 sim lane this is a good one to own build my own alright 14 000 fire to spend on household alright let's go here let's buy this house I'll build it school bus will arrive in an hour why
[20:52.96]I don't want a school bus to arrive in an hour.
[20:56.80]Is she reading the newspaper?
[20:57.88]This girl can't even read.
[21:01.72]Alright, hold on.
[21:03.44]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[21:05.65]Oh, that's gonna be a classic Caramel Sweets.
[21:08.15]She's the smart one of the family.
[21:09.43]Alright, let's build.
[21:15.85]That was absolutely the intro.
[21:17.25]That was absolutely the season one, episode one pilot of introducing these characters.
[21:25.29]Oh, that was a perfect start.
[21:31.01]And then halfway through season two, we stop, as directors and writers and animators, we stop making her smart.
[21:37.92]Because that's too much work and annoying to do now.
[21:44.70]Okay.
[21:45.08]What do I want to do?
[21:47.08]What kind of house do I want?
[21:52.30]I'm just going to go with just a regular house.
[22:00.29]I'm so bad at this part.
[22:02.39]This is why I always have pre-built stuff.
[22:04.08]Because I'm too fucking stupid to do it on my own.
[22:07.74]When I close my eyes, I can see a beautiful thing.
[22:11.24]I can exactly see how the architecture looks.
[22:12.92]I can see where the roof is.
[22:13.92]I can see a family opening the door.
[22:15.48]And a dog jumping up and everything.
[22:17.68]I can see this in my head right now.
[22:19.50]But when I try to make that, I just make a cube.
[22:21.40]Okay.
[22:28.17]Okay.
[22:35.21]Um, let's spin it around.
[22:37.11]Yeah, I like this view better.
[22:37.97]I don't like the other side.
[22:41.31]This would be the living room.
[22:43.33]I'm down a little more.
[22:43.93]Because I want a garden, too.
[22:53.28]How much money do I have?
[22:53.98]12,000.
[22:54.66]And by the way, no cheating.
[22:56.08]Alright, so this is the front door.
[23:01.46]I'm not done!
[23:02.44]This is the first part.
[23:07.33]Why is that so funny?
[23:09.03]This isn't even funny.
[23:10.51]This is the foundation of the house.
[23:14.50]Why is this funny?
[23:16.28]This is not even funny.
[23:17.50]Okay, then over here, we'll go like this.
[23:21.20]It's gonna be like the bathroom.
[23:23.44]This is not even funny.
[23:24.96]Okay, that's like gonna be a bathroom.
[23:36.96]And then over here.
[23:37.94]I like a kitchen.
[23:41.40]Okay.
[23:41.68]Wait, wait, wait.
[23:42.56]Shh.
[23:45.83]Here's the little patio.
[23:47.21]Walkway.
[23:48.13]Door.
[23:48.45]Go in the door.
[23:50.39]There's your kitchen.
[23:50.97]No.
[23:52.85]There's your kitchen.
[23:53.55]Kitchen's right here.
[23:56.29]And living room here.
[23:57.29]I want an open concept.
[24:00.76]This will be a bathroom.
[24:02.40]And then the bedroom will be over here.
[24:03.98]No.
[24:04.92]Yes.
[24:05.74]Yes.
[24:07.18]This house is fucked up.
[24:08.24]Why is this house fucked up?
[24:11.94]Is this a bedroom?
[24:19.81]Okay.
[24:19.91]Because there's nothing over here yet.
[24:27.27]Holy shit.
[24:27.95]What?
[24:29.19]You forgot the foundation.
[24:30.45]Well, I have to do... Hold on.
[24:31.79]Floor.
[24:32.07]So this is going to be a combo...
[24:37.80]Make a zerk off room.
[24:43.40]I don't know why I was just about to answer this with what I was about to say.
[24:46.62]And... I'm not gonna... No.
[24:50.02]I'm not even gonna say that.
[24:52.12]I was gonna say something.
[25:01.44]What con... Never mind.
[25:02.52]I was gonna say, what constitutes a zerk off room?
[25:05.92]What are you talking about?
[25:12.13]that you don't go on like a tour like a house or an apartment or something you're walking around okay so this is the bathroom this is a it's a full bath and over here we it's really nice they have a walk-in shower really cool here's the living room yeah yeah it's about uh it's about like 600 square feet in here oh this this this is the zerk off room yep this one here oh nice very very very nice honey what do you think of the zerk off room oh yeah this is great
[25:37.61]It's got extra privacy, yeah.
[25:39.01]There's two doors, as you see.
[25:40.51]There's one door that locks, and there's another door in front, just in case somebody gets in the first one.
[25:45.33]Oh, that's so useful.
[25:46.29]Yeah, because I'll be able to hear somebody open the first one, so then I can freak out and just, like, freak out and just stop, like, and stand there like a toy soldier, like nothing was happening.
[26:03.97]By the time they get to the second one, I'm just standing there.
[26:06.25]But if you go in the zerk off room, what else would you be doing in there?
[26:09.75]Why would you need privacy in the... People know what you're doing in there.
[26:17.26]It's not like it's... People wouldn't know.
[26:19.10]Airlock.
[26:25.59]Whoa, what is this?
[26:27.25]Oh, this is wood.
[26:28.63]No, wood floors are fucking overrated.
[26:30.55]I'm sorry.
[26:33.40]They get scuffed up, they get destroyed, they get broken, and they're fucking incredibly expensive.
[26:37.68]Expensive?
[26:38.68]Expensive.
[26:40.40]Wood floors are so expensive, and they just, they get beat up and stuff.
[26:47.59]I... I don't know.
[26:49.23]I mean, they look really nice.
[26:50.61]If you love wood, then sure.
[26:53.18]They have tons to take.
[26:54.56]You have to upkeep the hell out of them.
[26:59.14]I don't want a carpet in here.
[27:00.12]Oh, who wants to... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[27:04.62]Excuse me.
[27:05.12]Tile gang.
[27:16.91]Ooh, this is swanky.
[27:21.11]Basic wood Andy.
[27:22.21]Well...
[27:25.97]I like that.
[27:28.04]This is my house, I get to do whatever I want, okay?
[27:31.18]You can have- You can- Hey, you can go and get the- You can do The Sims 1.
[27:36.64]You can go and do the painful, horrible installation process and desperately trying to get it to turn on on Windows 10.
[27:42.31]And, uh, trying to figure out how to get it to fucking run.
[27:45.15]And have to pull it through a, like, DirectX pass-through program to get it to, like, actually show up on screen.
[27:52.12]And then you can make your own house!
[28:00.22]Run it in compatibility mode.
[28:01.36]Ooh, what is this?
[28:03.60]I don't like that.
[28:07.70]Oh, yep.
[28:08.48]No, ugly.
[28:09.04]Ooh, what is this?
[28:10.62]Moss?
[28:12.70]This is kind of like Minecraft.
[28:15.20]That's a Minecraft house.
[28:16.34]No, I don't want that.
[28:17.40]How do I sell?
[28:24.82]Castle floor.
[28:27.62]Is this a rug?
[28:31.34]This is The Sims 1.
[28:32.34]It may as well be Minecraft floors and walls and stuff.
[28:34.78]It's not that complicated.
[28:35.78]Alright, I'm gonna go with this.
[28:38.70]This is my kitchen area.
[28:44.22]It's gonna give me a headache looking at it.
[28:53.01]Yeah, it gives me a headache.
[28:55.71]I don't like it.
[28:56.71]How do I delete things?
[28:58.01]How do I get my money back?
[29:02.70]contractor finishes the last tile and you walk in.
[29:07.08]How do I delete this and get my money back?
[29:09.48]How do I remove that?
[29:13.03]Control?
[29:13.51]Okay.
[29:15.65]Wait.
[29:16.71]Oh my god.
[29:17.55]What?
[29:19.49]You don't get the full price back?
[29:28.42]No, you don't.
[29:29.16]Okay, I have to be really careful then.
[29:30.56]I want to make sure I can see what this looks like.
[29:33.49]This is alright.
[29:34.47]No, it's the same color as the walls.
[29:37.12]Ooh.
[29:38.92]Here we go.
[29:41.18]Right?
[29:41.98]That's gonna look cool.
[29:44.52]Alright, I'm done.
[29:46.62]It looks dirty.
[29:47.34]It needs to be washed.
[29:48.17]It doesn't matter.
[29:48.61]It's too late.
[29:52.67]What about here?
[29:53.17]This is the living room.
[29:57.49]Floors.
[29:58.59]Should I just do wood to just be fucking wood?
[30:02.46]Wait.
[30:04.58]Ooh, no.
[30:08.94]I don't hate this.
[30:12.23]Red.
[30:14.55]Red.
[30:16.37]Red.
[30:16.65]Oh, blue!
[30:20.01]Yeah!
[30:20.94]I like that.
[30:21.78]I like this too.
[30:22.58]I like this one better.
[30:27.32]Do I like this or do I not like this?
[30:29.58]Okay, part of my brain is at the crossroads where it doesn't know if I hate this or if I love it.
[30:37.14]It's right at the crossroads and it hasn't picked a door yet.
[30:39.74]You guys ever get like that?
[30:40.46]This is why I need everything pre-built and done for me.
[30:49.95]I'm so indecisive.
[30:50.97]I'm so erratic.
[30:53.49]You have to just build this house...
[30:57.05]and sit me down in front of The Sims and be like, how's that look?
[30:59.15]And I'll go, well, it looks great.
[31:01.05]Even if you, if you deliberately made a dog shit house and sat me down and told me, hey, here's your house.
[31:05.68]What do you think?
[31:06.62]I'd be like, oh, cool.
[31:08.42]Oh, nice.
[31:08.82]I love it.
[31:09.30]I love the carpet.
[31:10.04]I love it.
[31:14.97]Okay, that's that.
[31:18.85]What about, this is the bathroom.
[31:23.77]Weird, but okay.
[31:25.41]This is the bedroom.
[31:26.47]Wait, where's the kid's sleep?
[31:27.87]I need to make a kid room.
[31:38.21]This is like a magic eye house.
[31:42.39]I can't wait to like be sit on the ceiling looking down and just cross my eyes and like an elephant comes into view.
[31:50.96]Carpet in the bathroom?
[31:51.82]This is not carpet, isn't it?
[31:53.08]I thought that's tile.
[31:56.36]I need, uh, wallpaper.
[32:04.23]Those walls up.
[32:04.81]This is just the first house.
[32:13.03]Relax.
[32:13.55]It's- I got, like, I got all day, alright?
[32:25.76]That was the worst part when you can't find that one piece of the house.
[32:28.78]Oh, come on.
[32:29.54]Where is it?
[32:29.96]There it is.
[32:36.79]Why does Sims music go so hard?
[32:42.87]Sims 1 really might be one of the best gaming soundtracks ever.
[32:47.81]I really believe that.
[32:48.95]Okay, wait.
[32:50.97]I didn't want to do this.
[32:51.81]Oh, shit.
[32:52.31]I screwed it up.
[32:54.08]I want... What do I want for the kitchen?
[32:55.42]How about this?
[32:56.84]Ooh.
[32:57.60]That's like a nice like sand.
[32:58.72]The kitchen.
[33:00.00]I like it.
[33:03.34]They're gonna be paintings and stuff.
[33:04.84]Somebody said it's a pickle house.
[33:16.16]What are you talking about?
[33:25.12]Windows.
[33:25.54]Yeah, just hold on.
[33:26.52]That was just a pickle.
[33:30.66]Alright, bathroom.
[33:31.82]I want the bathroom to be really, really just pop and be really cool.
[33:34.44]Let's do something wild.
[33:38.77]Something wild, you know what I mean?
[33:42.15]Like this.
[33:44.57]Oh yeah, that's wild.
[33:46.75]Love it.
[33:54.78]It's not the bathroom.
[33:57.47]Shit.
[33:58.33]What am I doing?
[34:04.37]Okay.
[34:04.85]Well, I can fix that later.
[34:07.23]I'm just wasting so much money.
[34:09.57]Money is so valuable in The Sims 1 and 2.
[34:11.27]Where's this last piece?
[34:19.47]There we are.
[34:21.11]That's it, right?
[34:22.65]Yeah, it's good.
[34:24.88]Alright, now this bedroom.
[34:25.91]Let's do... Ooh!
[34:32.57]I kind of like this.
[34:33.31]This is a Russian grandma house.
[34:39.32]I can't laugh at this.
[34:48.83]Okay, I know people are going to make me laugh today, and I'm trying to not, like, because of the... Somebody said, you're making the Among Us map.
[34:56.64]I don't even play it, but that's funny.
[34:58.02]I, like, know what that is.
[35:04.14]Should I just make this Among Us?
[35:07.14]Oh, this is admin.
[35:07.76]I don't even know what admin does.
[35:15.83]I don't know what admin is, and it's not always that somebody's there getting in trouble.
[35:22.52]Okay.
[35:23.44]That's a good start.
[35:24.34]This looks unfinished because it looks so stupid.
[35:26.30]Okay.
[35:27.22]I have 8,600 bucks.
[35:30.76]I need... Oh, shit.
[35:32.06]I need doors.
[35:36.86]Men's room door.
[35:38.27]Should I have like a funny little... Oh, there's like a...
[35:43.15]Look, it's like a public bathroom, but it's not.
[35:48.36]Two public bathroom doors?
[35:54.66]I hate it.
[36:00.30]What about the kid's room?
[36:01.21]I'll figure that out in a second.
[36:02.35]The kid sleeps in a crib.
[36:04.35]No, never mind.
[36:05.03]That's a baby.
[36:06.05]Ooh.
[36:12.11]Is this a slider?
[36:12.83]Huh.
[36:16.84]No, it's not.
[36:22.24]Whatever, just go with a standard basic door.
[36:27.36]Oh, that's the bathroom door.
[36:32.08]What's with all the fucked up doors?
[36:41.37]Beachin' door?
[36:44.93]Why do all these look like cartoon doors or hotel rooms?
[36:49.59]I just want like a regular door.
[36:52.31]Celebrity security door?
[36:56.26]Wait, this is what we were just talking about.
[36:58.32]It's a video game.
[37:01.48]Alright, we're just gonna go with the standard boring one.
[37:06.30]Right there.
[37:07.32]Okay.
[37:09.20]Now I just want like an interior door.
[37:17.55]Office door.
[37:20.37]I forgot how ugly The Sims 1 stuff really could be.
[37:27.33]Fancy door.
[37:31.66]Folk mountain door.
[37:35.52]I mean... Alpine snow door?
[37:39.34]These are all so weird.
[37:48.04]Okay, alright, everyone, whatever.
[37:49.20]This is so boring, but I just need to get people into the house first.
[37:55.88]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[38:02.36]Now we need windows.
[38:06.91]Zerk off room.
[38:07.81]Just, we, I don't have enough money to make the Zerk off room, alright?
[38:10.83]Alright, so, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[38:14.37]I gotta get appliances in here, because I have to work in reverse.
[38:20.60]So we're talking about refrigerators.
[38:24.16]Should I just pony up for the extremely expensive one?
[38:29.72]Even this is a door.
[38:34.10]This is just a door.
[38:35.32]This is just a bureau.
[38:36.86]What the fuck?
[38:41.03]Never cold food hold.
[38:44.07]Food hold?
[38:45.01]Why did I say it like that?
[38:47.45]Food hold?
[38:47.73]Food hold?
[38:55.72]It's because of the rhyme.
[38:57.16]Alright, this is the standard one.
[39:03.22]This is fine.
[39:03.78]Alright, how do I want this to play out?
[39:07.93]You walk in here.
[39:09.41]Bridge always goes in the corner.
[39:11.19]That looks alright.
[39:15.09]What about stoves?
[39:18.65]Large appliances.
[39:19.27]Here we go.
[39:20.59]Stove.
[39:21.23]No, this is a trash compactor.
[39:24.94]What do these things do?
[39:25.74]This kind of scares me.
[39:29.68]So, any of you trash compactor Andes, I have a question.
[39:33.83]Does this, like, crush the trash?
[39:36.61]Do you put a bunch of trash in here, then you close the door and you press the button and it, like, squishes it and crushes it?
[39:45.11]Like, isn't that, like, kind of scary?
[39:46.36]Like, I feel like that would be, like, scary.
[39:50.84]And then what?
[39:51.22]So you condense?
[39:51.90]So then what do you do with it after that?
[39:54.84]Is it just crushed on the bottom?
[39:56.20]How do you get it out of there?
[39:57.97]What do you do with it?
[39:58.55]They're dangerous.
[40:02.27]Yeah, but so what do you do?
[40:03.51]Just like, is there a bag in there?
[40:07.43]So is there like a bag?
[40:08.41]You put the trash into the bag and then it crushes the bag.
[40:11.13]Like how do you get it out of here?
[40:20.39]He doesn't know.
[40:23.61]What is this American shit?
[40:25.17]I don't know.
[40:25.71]I'm asking.
[40:26.13]I don't have one of these.
[40:26.91]I've never seen one of these before.
[40:29.98]Are you pretending?
[40:32.22]No, no.
[40:32.50]Like, look, I understand what it does.
[40:34.76]I'm asking, like, is there a bag or something inside of this machine?
[40:39.88]Like, what do you do with it after it's crushed?
[40:42.64]How do you get it out?
[40:48.89]It's in the bag.
[40:53.00]You don't, it's a video game.
[40:54.58]What?
[40:58.14]Hold on, somebody just said it.
[40:59.53]It crushes it with the bag inside of there, and it crushes the bag.
[41:02.21]Wouldn't the bag break?
[41:03.45]Let's find out.
[41:04.15]I kinda wanna know.
[41:04.87]375?
[41:08.03]Just put it outside, whatever, fuck it.
[41:13.57]I wouldn't be scared of it out there.
[41:14.67]12 people have died from a trash compactor.
[41:18.78]What?! !
[41:25.08]Where's the stove?
[41:32.25]Should I get like a stand-up stove?
[41:33.79]This is like a sink.
[41:35.99]Just put a barbecue in here.
[41:37.53]That's perfect.
[41:47.32]Why do I feel like a shitload of American dudes would rather this?
[41:55.90]than having an actual stove.
[41:57.18]Okay, I'll do it and fuck it, let's go.
[42:01.97]I don't even want a stove.
[42:07.25]Okay, what about this?
[42:13.73]All he would eat was just, dad, I don't want to eat hamburgers, hot dogs, and Italian sausages anymore.
[42:19.15]Hey, hold on, the game is on.
[42:24.49]always a game on you have every channel you watch Japanese baseball yeah there has to always be a game on always okay that's fine I mean it's probably not going to be fine eventually but whatever
[42:50.63]Ooh!
[42:50.85]Wait, wait, wait.
[42:51.45]What do you need?
[42:51.99]You need a stove, you need a fridge, you need a... I need, like, a microwave.
[42:54.88]Oh, here we go.
[42:55.30]Like, this is good.
[42:56.36]I like that look.
[42:59.00]What's over here?
[42:59.46]I need a table.
[43:12.65]This is so bad.
[43:13.49]Okay.
[43:15.27]Tables.
[43:15.83]Just a little one.
[43:21.84]Shit.
[43:22.00]This house is not big enough.
[43:23.56]There we go.
[43:28.76]I just wanted to spin it.
[43:29.48]Spin it.
[43:29.70]Okay.
[43:40.58]It's like the kitchen in an office.
[43:42.94]Yeah, kind of.
[43:43.84]There just needs to be a bunch of cabinets up here.
[43:45.25]It's like a gross coffee maker.
[43:51.33]That nobody uses because if you look in where the water goes, it's rusted and fucking disgusting.
[43:56.45]No one turns it on.
[44:03.44]There's the one brave soul every, like, maybe once a week or two.
[44:08.09]that is so desperate for coffee.
[44:11.49]A bunch of you are in the room, and you just hear the person going, Fuck!
[44:15.68]I need coffee so bad!
[44:17.02]And they start to turn it on, and they plug it in.
[44:18.94]It's like, oh shit, this place is actually going to use the coffee maker in here.
[44:22.80]And they turn it on.
[44:23.50]They're like, oh, how much should I put in there?
[44:25.58]And it starts to smell.
[44:27.24]The whole room smells like that burnt, smelly, old plastic smell.
[44:33.83]And everyone's just like, shit, dude.
[44:35.67]Oh, I don't know if you should do that.
[44:41.60]Sometimes, once every couple of weeks, once every like month or so, someone will do that.
[44:47.10]I used the Keurig at my work and it tasted like death.
[44:51.83]Yeah, and here, okay, here's the thing.
[44:54.39]I'm gonna give you a little bit of a rant here.
[44:59.23]For an office to have like a $30 Mr. Coffee in the corner of the office room, of like the break room or something.
[45:08.71]the like you you gotta like you got employees here don't you want your employees to be able to get like awesome coffee so they're like happy and they want to like work and you pony up for like the good one get like the good coffee maker that like it cleans itself and it likes like espresso and get one of those people will be lined up at the door
[45:33.23]Like get in there and get like a coffee in the morning.
[45:35.29]And you can sit like in your office and be like, alright, here they go.
[45:37.83]They're gonna be all coffeed up.
[45:40.27]Anybody want any cream?
[45:41.03]You want cream?
[45:41.77]I would be running around the office with a fucking coffee creamer.
[45:45.69]And like those little wood sticks and shit.
[45:47.73]With like mugs.
[45:48.95]Everybody would have like their own name on the mugs and shit.
[45:51.69]I'd be like, you need coffee?
[45:52.45]You need creamer in there?
[45:55.50]I would just lean in.
[45:56.48]You tell me when.
[45:58.46]Alright, there you go.
[45:59.16]Alright, if you want more coffee, it's ready.
[46:05.81]Alright, we have a microwave that I got from my grandmother's house after she died.
[46:12.95]And we've just plugged it in over here.
[46:18.99]Like, what?
[46:22.03]Why?
[46:23.39]Doesn't that make people just fucking hate going to work?
[46:28.94]If your break room is the equivalent of, like, an antique shop...
[46:35.39]And half the stuff is just gross and doesn't work.
[46:37.59]Nobody wants to go in there.
[46:38.57]I have my own fucking office.
[46:46.74]It's going to be a goddamn... This is going to be the best coffee maker that I can get.
[46:51.40]It's going right there.
[46:52.24]There's going to be a whole bar here.
[46:53.48]There's going to be like flavor pumps.
[46:55.06]There's going to be like fucking stirring spoons.
[47:06.24]IRS And then my company goes out of business in like 30 days But it's the I don't want you don't want to go too far being like the the cool boss
[47:20.03]Because then I would make like a... I would bring like clowns to work and stuff and that probably... I can't work, Mr. Elbertson.
[47:26.49]You can't bring like clowns to work like once a... like Friday.
[47:28.83]It's fucking annoying.
[47:29.55]It was funny on Friday that one time.
[47:31.77]Like April Fool's and stuff.
[47:34.54]But like... No, I don't want to like ride the slide before I start working.
[47:38.80]Like can I just go to work?
[47:44.03]I don't want to, like, get on the ride before work and, like, have, like, a big company, like, let's all scream on the roller coaster you built in the backyard.
[47:53.61]I have, like, a couple reports I have to finish.
[47:57.72]What was I doing?
[47:58.28]Where was I going with this?
[48:17.51]I can't.
[48:18.07]Whatever.
[48:18.49]I gotta move on.
[48:20.19]I'm thinking of other things that I find funny that I have to, like, not think of funny.
[48:23.77]I have to, like, move on.
[48:25.17]Alright.
[48:25.77]Company pizza party.
[48:26.74]Let's go.
[48:31.10]What do we got?
[48:31.96]We need seats.
[48:33.82]Ooh.
[48:34.10]No, no, not yet.
[48:34.94]Counters.
[48:35.32]Uh...
[48:48.32]Look, you gotta put your money where your mouth is, and, like, I... Uh, my... What is this?
[48:56.65]It's a tea set?
[49:05.85]I need a toaster oven, right?
[49:07.12]Yeah.
[49:17.96]Oh, that's ugly.
[49:19.84]Ugly.
[49:21.80]Ugly.
[49:23.40]Whoa.
[49:24.86]Ugh.
[49:28.28]Ugh!
[49:28.40]Do people still do this?
[49:34.47]Do people still do... Can you imagine doing this?
[49:41.89]This would be fucking horrifying.
[49:43.37]This would be terrifying.
[49:47.03]Why would you... Why would you want that?
[49:48.85]I remember when I was younger, this was always the... Oh, like a big bear carpet.
[49:57.22]Wow.
[49:58.24]That's ridiculous.
[49:59.24]It was always like the meme for like a wealthy person's house.
[50:02.24]They had like the bear carpet.
[50:03.44]And I always thought it was really weird.
[50:05.48]And like thinking of this now...
[50:08.75]That's like, isn't that really strange to have like the bear's like whole body flayed out?
[50:13.03]Like dead?
[50:13.99]With his head on?
[50:16.33]What the fuck are people doing this for?
[50:17.93]I can't, I could not stand on that or lie down on that and be comfortable.
[50:26.18]It would give me like anxiety.
[50:27.26]I'd be like, this is like fucked up.
[50:34.91]Vegan Andy.
[50:37.56]Okay, there's a difference between not eating, like, meat, and this, okay, this is like a flayed out, like, dead bear on the ground.
[50:49.53]You can't, this is different.
[50:50.85]This is like a different, there's a huge spectrum here.
[51:06.33]It looks like, it's horrible.
[51:08.25]That's horrible looking.
[51:11.12]What the fuck?
[51:12.04]What is that?
[51:14.86]What do you think leather is?
[51:16.77]I don't, look, listen.
[51:18.45]I don't wear, I don't have like leather clothes.
[51:23.00]And look, look, if you have leather, like a leather wallet or something, okay, this is leather, right?
[51:27.82]Leather's a thing.
[51:29.12]But, like, if there was, like, a dead skinned cow on the ground in your house, it would be a little weird, wouldn't it?
[51:36.29]It's like you stopped at, like, the halfway point.
[51:43.82]No, no, no, no, no.
[51:44.38]Dark Turn, I want that skinned cow with its head on, lying on the ground.
[51:48.16]And I want to step on it.
[51:49.76]I want to roll around in it.
[51:51.62]I want to like get in there and roll around on him.
[51:55.28]That's different than having like a leather wallet in your pocket.
[52:00.18]I'm sorry.
[52:00.70]I will die on that hill.
[52:10.23]That's why Jerma uses ridge wallets.
[52:13.41]I can't say that because you all fucking... You all just like memed me to death.
[52:26.24]Alright, I keep getting distracted.
[52:27.08]Let's go.
[52:27.30]What do I need?
[52:29.90]I need chairs.
[52:31.24]Mmm, these are alright.
[52:39.93]How many people live here?
[52:40.63]Three?
[52:44.07]There'll be no more than two people sitting at any given time.
[52:47.70]Rule of thumb, if you have a table and chairs in your house, this is very important.
[52:51.64]The amount of chairs you have, half of them will always be used.
[52:55.14]So if you have like six seats at a dining table, three to four will have people sitting at them at any given time.
[53:01.26]So you go practical.
[53:04.68]Unless it's like seven people in your family or something.
[53:10.36]No windows.
[53:10.90]I'm working on it.
[53:17.29]Ooh, I like that.
[53:17.83]45.
[53:18.43]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[53:19.17]I'm almost out of money.
[53:21.39]Alright, beds.
[53:23.97]I need a... This is $3,000?
[53:26.98]What?
[53:27.28]That's too much.
[53:34.86]Are these the only beds that two people can sleep in?
[53:45.83]I need a bed for the kid, too.
[53:51.04]That's weird.
[53:51.86]I need another room.
[53:53.86]That would be so odd.
[53:59.30]No, that would be weird.
[54:00.48]Let me make another room.
[54:02.34]Everybody relax.
[54:05.42]Would it be like an offshoot from this one?
[54:06.98]No, but then you'd have to go into the... No.
[54:41.52]This is a kid's room.
[54:42.28]It's gonna be fun.
[54:46.25]Don't worry, I'll make it fun on the walls.
[54:53.71]See?
[54:54.53]Wait, no.
[54:57.07]This is fun.
[54:57.63]Well, this actually kind of looks dirty.
[55:00.81]See?
[55:08.60]This looks like skin.
[55:10.38]Whatever.
[55:20.90]Among us.
[55:22.20]I fucking... I... God.
[55:24.68]Not... Whatever.
[55:26.22]Okay.
[55:29.69]Now we can put the bed in here.
[55:34.29]Everybody needs to get a job, too.
[55:36.76]What's the comfort on this thing?
[55:39.42]Comfort 7, energy 8.
[55:40.34]Yeah, that's fine.
[55:45.15]against the wall here and then I need some other stuff in the bedroom lighting well we need lights I need windows too alright hanging lamps perfect this in here right there right above the bed they're like the hanging spikes this is a bathroom what are these it's a chandelier alright how about right here
[56:18.55]Right above?
[56:19.11]Yeah, you know what I'm saying?
[56:21.75]What do you mean?
[56:30.58]It's like a McDonald's warming lamp.
[56:33.10]It's like a lizard lamp.
[56:34.49]Whatever.
[56:34.81]I gotta put like a humidifier in here too.
[56:46.81]I need some, uh, what do I need?
[56:49.31]Surfaces.
[56:49.75]I need some end tables.

[58:01.37]Alright, we're gonna have to work for the TV and the couch.
[58:04.69]How do you get a job in The Sims 1?
[58:06.03]Why do I have this?
[58:06.81]I don't know.
[58:11.40]I don't even have a bathroom!
[58:13.34]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[58:17.34]Is this a public urinal?

[58:24.64]If you had this in your house, I would probably leave.
[58:29.60]I would leave.
[58:30.62]I would find a way to stop talking to you.
[58:33.87]Over like a few months.
[58:37.17]Yeah, I wouldn't do it outright.
[58:38.51]We'd continue to hang out.
[58:39.65]We'd do whatever.
[58:41.81]But like over like the next six months, I'm going to make sure I find a way to stop talking to you.
[58:49.90]It's like long term, I'm not sure that you and I are gonna get along.

[121:14.76]Be teased?
[121:17.60]Let her read.
[121:18.72]Let her read the book, Arthur.
[121:22.60]Just let her read.
[121:23.64]Be teased.
[121:26.20]Be teased.
[121:28.76]No, will you just go fuck off?
[121:37.86]Let her get some fun, please.
[121:40.54]What did you do?
[121:41.10]Oh my fucking god.
[121:42.62]Why does everything suck?
[121:45.69]Why does everything just get destroyed?
[121:47.31]It's been like 15 in-game days in The Sims so far.
[121:54.77]Maybe 20.
[121:55.97]And every appliance is broken twice.
[121:57.87]This house sucks.
[121:58.91]These appliances are terrible.
[121:59.99]I have to repair the sink.
[122:02.96]I've been using it for three or four days.
[122:04.66]This is really eating into my time here.
[122:17.03]The Sims 1 is fucking impossible.
[122:22.41]Got it.
[122:22.67]I'll be alright.
[122:23.09]She's doing fine.
[122:25.97]And then after this, I'm gonna... 11pm.
[122:27.87]So 10pm I gotta be ready.
[122:29.33]Let's make some food.
[122:41.81]Wait.
[122:43.27]Study cooking so I can make better meals.
[122:44.77]What do you mean uh-uh?
[122:47.43]You don't uh-uh me.
[122:49.97]Go and read a book.
[123:01.00]Well.
[123:03.98]Um.
[123:08.02]Should we just both read a book together?
[123:09.34]At the same time?
[123:16.28]Reading is boring as fuck.
[123:17.32]Play video games.
[123:35.71]I feel like we're racing to see who can finish the book faster.
[123:37.93]I mean, that's kind of fun.
[123:46.19]Okay, now will you learn cooking so you can make food?
[123:50.48]Why?
[123:51.00]What's wrong?
[123:54.70]And brought home 90 bucks.
[123:55.68]You mean, what are you, too depressed to read?
[123:59.68]Why?
[124:08.69]Why don't they ever move?
[124:09.89]Alright, let's have like a family...
[124:13.48]Um, let's, like, have a family night.
[124:15.48]You know what I mean?

[124:31.78]Where is it?
[124:33.42]Where's the toy train set?
[124:37.50]There it is!
[124:39.32]Alright, family, let's go.
[124:50.85]Everybody get over here.
[124:51.49]We're going to have a family night.
[124:52.45]I don't like cats.
[125:02.22]Alright, family night.
[125:04.38]Stop fighting.
[125:08.60]Yes, we're going to get everyone on the train and we're going to have a family night.
[125:13.00]Here we go.
[125:15.00]No, he hates it.
[125:19.45]What's wrong with it?
[125:21.61]No!
[125:21.79]Have fun together!
[125:22.93]Play!
[125:26.15]They hate it.
[125:34.03]Come on!
[125:36.41]Oh, is this not fun?
[125:42.35]This isn't fun.
[125:43.35]She's losing fun.

[126:28.42]Hurry, hurry, hurry!
[126:29.50]Put it out!
[126:34.07]What?
[126:35.93]Oh no, a skunk has decided to make your lot its new home.
[126:38.47]Better call animal control to relocate this pest before he causes trouble.
[126:44.40]Where is the skunk?
[126:51.55]No!
[126:52.41]Run!
[126:53.29]Somebody put him out!

[127:23.21]He's alive!
[127:25.57]He's alive!
[127:25.94]He's alive!
[127:26.56]You can't take him!
[127:28.70]Put this shit out!
[127:29.40]Quick!
[127:33.16]Oh no!
[127:34.80]It's over!
[127:35.98]It's over!

[127:39.31]Get up!
[127:39.59]Get up!
[127:44.29]Why is it spreading so fast?
[127:48.59]Where's the kid?
[127:50.01]Oh, shit!
[127:50.71]She's alright!
[127:58.24]She's okay!
[127:58.46]I wish death could fucking help!
[128:00.36]Oh, no!
[128:00.48]Put it out!
[128:15.89]What was that weird Marvel character move?
[128:18.55]No, my stuff!
[128:41.85]It's way easier to fucking deal with two people in a house.
[128:45.27]Way easier.
[128:46.23]Good.
[128:46.51]Fuck it.
[128:47.61]Arthur Sweet's dead.
[128:48.71]Never coming back.
[128:49.31]No.
[129:02.56]This is like... Is this him?
[129:17.81]Walking outside.
[129:20.00]Into the trash.
[129:26.24]This game is much harder than I remember.
[129:27.98]It is difficult to win.
[129:30.56]At least you never have enough chairs.
[129:35.90]What did you say?
[129:36.54]There's less mouths to feed now.
[129:42.21]The fact that death lit on fire too.
[129:43.93]That was ridiculous.
[129:44.51]No cheating.
[129:53.28]Don't worry.
[129:53.62]I'll get a husband.
[129:57.86]We will replace Arthur Sweets.
[130:10.17]Oh, my God.
[130:10.69]That was so fucking funny.
[130:13.23]And the fact that the kid... Why the kid is just not even waking up from this?
[130:17.89]Okay, what happens when the... Is this kid gonna know that, like, Arthur's gone?
[130:24.59]Is he gonna wake... Is she gonna wake up and be like, oh, no, like, Arthur, was it even her dad?
[130:29.85]This is so fucked up.
[130:38.43]Holding it with her chin.
[130:42.13]Please get a fire alarm.
[130:44.65]Well, I need way more help than that, because now I don't have a stove, and I don't... At least I have a coffee maker.
[130:49.78]I can sell the coffee maker.
[131:14.42]How long is this kid sleeping for?
[131:26.91]We don't have a stove anymore.
[131:41.70]Wine and milk.
[131:48.07]Okay, well, we're gonna be fine.
[131:51.50]Arthur ate way too much anyways.
[131:54.68]What should I do with this?
[132:16.25]I don't know where to put it.
[132:22.44]By the way, where's Arthur?
[132:28.34]And where's our stove?
[132:29.56]Why does it smell like burnt charcoal in here?
[132:38.88]I don't really like aliens that much.
[132:42.71]I don't think she knows.
[132:46.99]Her, like, fun is fine.
[132:47.99]Her social is fine.
[132:48.96]I don't think she understands what's going on.
[132:50.44]Alright, well, let's make... Oh, boy.
[132:55.04]Okay.
[132:55.68]Um... Take a shower.
[132:58.46]Okay.
[133:08.87]By the way, wasn't there a raccoon or something?
[133:11.28]Or a skunk?
[133:12.88]Where is it?
[133:16.18]Where's this skunk?
[133:17.30]Did it die in the fire?
[133:20.80]Okay, you.

[133:56.07]Arthur was the skunk.
[134:02.27]Why does every fucking thing suck?
[134:05.52]Just don't even have a sink.
[134:06.46]Put the plates outside.
[134:08.01]Like, is it even worth having a sink?
[134:12.95]Honestly, go out and just spray yourself on the face with a hose.
[134:15.11]Like, this is ridiculous.
[134:16.09]This keeps happening.
[134:23.06]Alright, just wait.

[144:50.47]Nice to meet you, Johnny.
[144:52.63]I'm Caramel.
[144:57.27]Um... Let's talk about your interests.
[145:00.49]Alright, we made a friend.
[145:12.76]How much is a butler?
[145:13.46]Alright, what- how much things need to be repaired?

[145:23.82]Just- you come and you do it.
[145:25.18]Because I- I'm not- I'm not doing this shit.
[145:26.98]You don't have any money?
[145:31.92]I need a repairman to fix all this.
[145:35.14]I need to clean up.
[145:37.32]You get in the shower.
[145:38.12]Take a bath, use the toilet, eat some food.
[145:46.99]$50 an hour.
[145:47.67]Whoa, that's so much money.
[145:49.23]No, I'll do it myself.
[145:50.49]Okay, it's 5 p.m.
[146:05.64]Tell this kid to leave.
[146:06.91]I don't want this kid to eat any of my food.
[146:09.35]He's going to walk in.
[146:09.89]He's going to grab a plate.
[146:10.63]It's going to piss me off.
[146:12.95]No, get out.
[146:13.47]Leave.
[146:14.75]Goodbye, Johnny.
[146:15.37]Thanks for coming over.
[146:15.95]Goodbye.
[146:20.70]Out.
[146:22.22]You think that's funny?
[146:32.91]Yeah, you're real funny.
[146:38.01]I told you to leave, Johnny.
[146:47.08]He's gone, whatever.
[146:48.84]Okay.
[146:50.99]Why do they have to go to the bathroom so much?
[146:53.71]This feels like it's modded.
[146:55.19]Is that alright?
[147:11.26]Okay, now you need to... Go to the... You don't... Yeah.
[147:16.92]No, no, no.
[147:17.22]You go.
[147:17.44]You don't need to use... You're fine.
[147:19.78]You're going to watch a little bit of television.
[147:21.62]And then you're going to go to sleep.
[147:24.58]In that order.
[147:27.98]No, you're going to eat.
[147:29.02]And then you're going to go to bed.
[147:29.74]And then you're going to entertain mom with a crazy dance.
[147:39.95]This is mostly liquid.
[147:50.01]What's she doing?
[147:51.71]Hunger is good.
[147:52.43]Eat another plate.
[147:56.16]Come on.
[148:00.06]Clean.
[148:01.94]Stop using the fucking sink!
[148:03.62]I'm gonna delete it.
[148:05.28]It's like they turn on... They turn the water on and they grab the little hose extension that's on people's sinks and they just spray it all over the fucking floor.
[148:13.71]Just don't use the sink anymore.
[148:21.70]Go sit down and watch horror movies and stuff.
[148:30.55]What are you doing?
[148:34.83]No, stop using the sinks.
[148:36.11]She used to pee again.
[148:40.75]Oh, good.
[148:43.01]Look.
[148:43.73]It's almost time for you to go to bed.
[148:44.83]Clean up in here.
[148:50.39]Alright.
[148:50.91]It's clean in here.
[148:53.91]Fix this.
[148:55.11]No, you can't.
[148:56.23]Can the kid do it?
[148:58.17]No.
[148:58.35]Alright.
[149:00.56]The kid is almost... It's good.
[149:02.14]Ready for bed.
[149:07.66]You wanted to... A kid would, like, call the neighbor, right?
[149:10.04]Before bed.
[149:11.59]No, it's 10 o'clock.
[149:12.19]It's 10.30.
[149:12.77]Too late.
[149:13.47]Go to bed.
[149:15.21]You.
[149:17.31]Take a shower.
[149:20.17]Take a piss.
[149:22.39]And then you go watch TV.
[149:24.99]Sit down and watch TV.
[149:33.08]And eat this.
[149:33.56]Everything is still horrible after losing Arthur.
[149:39.66]It is.
[149:40.98]But we will improve.
[149:42.12]We just need to get back to a baseline.
[149:44.80]We'll be okay.
[149:48.62]We're going to recycle these.
[149:50.38]Throw these away.
[149:51.04]I still need a stove.
[149:54.42]I need to replace the stove.
[150:00.78]How we doing?
[150:02.40]Good.
[150:03.36]Good.
[150:05.02]Throwing this shit away.
[150:05.78]Throwing that away.
[150:07.36]Now...
[150:11.21]What was that?
[150:15.07]When it plays the Jaws music, that means something bad is happening, right?
[150:28.07]Oh my god.
[150:28.89]Why am I attracting all the animals?
[150:38.36]Who cares?
[150:39.06]Oh, whatever.
[150:41.28]He can't come in the house.
[150:44.76]Can he come in the house?
[150:45.50]Do I have to call pest control again?
[150:48.82]No, he's just a little asshole.
[150:52.37]He's just going to do that and leave.
[150:53.27]Alright, it's 4.20am.
[150:56.95]Alright.
[151:10.10]What time do you... Yeah, I can't have you miss work again.
[151:15.92]Your work isn't back... Okay, okay, okay.
[151:18.48]By 2 p.m., I gotta be ready.
[151:20.74]I can do it.
[151:21.12]Let's serve some breakfast here.
[151:26.93]Save it.
[151:27.59]If this burns down, I'm gonna be so pissed.
[151:29.07]I thought that was her.
[151:34.29]Where are you going?
[151:40.40]Are you going to clean up all the way across the whole street?
[151:43.17]Alright, whatever.
[151:56.56]Comfort.
[151:59.42]Social.
[151:59.92]Alright, let's have a... Let's talk.
[152:02.66]Come on in here.
[152:05.03]We need to talk.
[152:05.67]We need to, like, entertain.
[152:08.21]Uh, do a crazy dance.
[152:09.97]And then you, um, ask, uh, you, um, talk.
[152:15.61]About interests.
[152:16.57]Somebody get the phone!
[152:22.49]Arthur.
[152:34.04]You're fixing your phone line.
[152:35.04]Don't pick up the phone the next time it rings.
[152:46.57]It's scary.
[152:51.59]Okay, I need to work on my... ...fun.
[152:58.70]Switch to, like, cartoons.
[153:02.48]Alright, let's have fun.
[153:04.60]Sit with me.
[153:04.98]Hang on.
[153:07.78]Having fun.
[153:08.34]Okay.
[153:17.97]Hunger.
[153:18.53]The kid needs to eat.
[153:19.61]Oh, the bus is here.
[153:20.55]Alright, just go to school.
[153:25.57]My energy is so low.
[153:26.81]Weren't you just asleep?
[153:28.29]Not even like six hours ago.
[153:37.73]turn off the penis music 2pm right?
[153:52.52]1 o'clock let's get up have a quick lunch and then I'm gonna pee fucking bugs everywhere shit
[154:10.29]Get those bugs.
[154:11.97]Can you get the bugs?
[154:13.43]How did you get in here?
[154:15.63]How did this cat get in here?
[154:17.71]I don't understand.
[154:18.35]I didn't open the door.
[154:18.97]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[154:27.88]Hurry, go to work.
[154:31.12]Go.
[154:31.42]Go.
[154:32.62]Go.
[155:06.12]Yeah, I don't even know what to do.
[155:07.98]Sit and... What are your grades like?
[155:10.54]Uh-oh.
[155:12.80]C+.
[155:28.49]This is so fucked up.
[155:31.53]She's depressed.
[155:32.43]I'm trying!
[155:33.11]On The Sims 1, to like go to the bathroom, take a shower and eat food, it takes like six hours!
[155:52.86]Sit down.
[155:56.74]Watch those cartoons.
[155:59.96]Well, at least turn the fucking TV off.
[156:02.42]Alright, now go back in there.
[156:21.06]And go, like, switch to action.
[156:25.42]You need to watch TV for a little while.
[156:26.92]Wait, this is... It's like horror movies.
[156:44.39]Oh, my stomach.
[156:49.43]Alright, go to bed.
[157:00.22]Is this just our cat now?
[157:03.14]The cat's hungry.
[157:04.72]I'm not your owner.
[157:05.68]The cat is hungry.
[157:12.17]I mean, can I feed?
[157:21.34]I don't think I can feed the cat.
[157:28.21]Alright, clean up.
[157:31.63]Find agent?
[157:32.37]What's that mean?
[157:42.68]It's too much to do.
[157:43.72]There's so many animals.
[157:55.33]Okay, what can I do to help this here?
[157:59.43]Go read a book.
[158:03.98]Clean up and then read a book for a while.
[158:05.78]You have all day tomorrow.
[158:06.72]Turn the TV off.
[158:12.99]Wait, she's reading and watching TV at the same time.
[158:15.53]This actually might help with the fun.
[158:19.35]Okay.
[158:20.13]Not bad.
[158:27.85]No social, you Redditor.
[158:32.39]What days of the week do I work?
[158:36.69]Every day?
[158:43.64]Animals will give social.
[158:45.82]Oh, okay.
[158:48.36]I'm going to make... The kid's going to wake up soon.
[158:50.70]I'm going to serve breakfast.
[158:53.40]Save it.
[158:55.70]No weekends and no rest.
[159:03.17]Alright.
[159:07.10]At least she got it done.
[159:08.08]She got it done.
[159:08.64]She got it done.
[159:09.22]She got it done.
[159:14.82]Holy shit, you have to eat so much food!
[159:23.11]Why does it take so much food to get the hunger to go up?
[159:27.55]It's the third plate of food!
[159:36.85]Get up.
[159:39.90]Get up.
[159:41.88]Go to the bathroom.
[159:45.00]Do you need to go to the bathroom?
[159:49.90]Go to the bathroom.
[159:50.62]Take a shower.
[159:54.06]God.
[159:55.84]Eat.
[159:59.94]It's such ridiculous snoring.
[160:09.00]Please mute the snoring.
[160:10.46]I don't think I can.
[160:13.44]That's like a major part of the whole game.
[160:19.67]I just have to get to a point where I'm not just chasing my own tail.
[160:26.65]I gotta get like the repair, like everything's broken.
[160:28.95]I'm constantly in a state of just complete disarray.
[160:32.73]How you doing?
[160:37.75]Hygiene and bladder.
[160:39.82]You're actually not in a bad place right now, but you have no fun.
[160:42.47]Fun is really dragging you down.
[160:47.09]Read a little book for a little while before the boss gets here.
[160:49.51]Okay.
[160:55.83]Boss will arrive in about an hour.
[160:56.76]Alright, we're good.
[161:01.70]Look, mood is fine.
[161:04.84]Grades are going to improve.
[161:05.68]See you later.
[161:09.52]Jerma, please.
[161:10.24]The only lights you have in your house is the TV and lamps directly above their beds, nowhere else.
[161:14.42]You don't even have windows for natural light.
[161:16.81]That's why everything's... breaking.
[161:19.13]They can't fucking see what they're doing.
[161:25.28]Alright, let me- I want like a coffee.
[161:29.04]I'll be right back.
[161:30.54]I want to talk about something really quick before I go BRB.
[161:33.72]So there used to be BRB art when I would go BRB.
[161:39.15]That is going to have to change because the amount of art, because I'm only going to stream like once or twice a week, it's going to be impossible to keep up.
[161:49.41]There is, I believe, a thousand pieces of art that are just in the backlog, which is just impossible.
[161:57.86]I will never be able to keep up with it.
[162:00.16]So, for the time being, we're pausing submissions until I can figure out a solution.
[162:06.06]And there are a few solutions that I think I want to do.
[162:09.71]Yeah, that is Comic Sans, isn't it?
[162:12.95]There are a few different solutions, but it's going to become impossible.
[162:20.29]Because we did the math.
[162:24.21]I will be like four and a half months, six months behind.
[162:27.83]Always.
[162:29.29]And it's going to get to a point where there might be two, three, four thousand submissions that are in the backlog and they will never be shown.
[162:34.86]Ever.
[162:36.86]And remember, I only stream once a week.
[162:39.06]So, showing artwork for like a stream is impossible if I'm only going to stream once, maybe twice a week.
[162:48.99]So,
[162:50.74]I am coming up with something to do, and it might be really fun.
[162:54.16]It might be really interesting.
[162:57.10]I'll tell you when I have that solution.
[162:58.44]It's being worked on right now.
[163:03.24]Show them on multiple screens at once.
[163:06.22]No.
[163:09.52]Just have two hour-long VRVs.
[163:16.48]One a second.
[163:18.52]That would be so bad.
[163:19.50]No.
[163:20.34]But so BRB Art is on pause right now until I can figure out what I'm going to do.
[163:24.56]And I do want to say this.
[163:25.45]I do appreciate anybody that sends any fan art to this channel.
[163:31.45]As you've known, the channel has grown insanely over the last year or two.
[163:36.01]I didn't even look.
[163:37.39]There's 16,000 people here right now.
[163:39.39]That's fucking crazy.
[163:40.65]I hope you're having fun.
[163:42.17]But it is getting to a point where I'm reducing the streams and I just can't keep up with it.
[163:47.60]It's so much awesome stuff, but it's just impossible to keep up with.
[163:52.44]I can't even like comprehend that this many people are here watching and on top of that want to make pieces and artwork and videos and stuff.
[164:01.18]It's a lot.
[164:01.72]I can't even, it's incredible.
[164:03.97]But, uh, no, just know that I don't, like, it's not that I don't care about art and community videos and community stuff.
[164:11.60]It's just I've grown in size by, like, 150% and I've reduced the streams by, like, 80%.
[164:20.90]Uncredible.
[164:21.66]Well, I said it wrong.
[164:24.07]Uh, so, yeah, I'm gonna try to figure out something to do.
[164:27.61]It'll be fun.
[164:28.23]It'll be interesting, I hope.
[164:30.19]So, just know that that's why BRBR is currently, like, on pause.
[164:35.11]We'll figure it out.
[164:36.47]We always do, right?
[164:38.12]I'll be right back.
[164:38.62]Go get a snack.
[164:39.38]Go get a coffee.
[164:40.10]That's what I'm doing.
[164:40.62]I'll be right back.
[164:42.10]See you guys in a minute.
[170:51.83]Sorry.
[170:52.07]I had to make coffee.
[170:53.29]It was just... I had to.
[171:00.77]When they were drinking the espresso, it just looked so good.
[171:02.71]I had to make my own.
[171:06.17]Ready?
[171:06.49]Let's go.
[171:10.12]You see it?
[171:10.44]Hey, there we are.
[171:13.18]Oh, phone, phone, phone.
[171:17.46]Oh, too late.
[171:21.95]You're still at school?
[171:24.58]Alright, I need to... I'm gonna call the repairman.
[171:28.20]I have to.
[171:30.80]Call the repairman.
[171:31.64]Have him fix this shit.
[171:32.44]It's gonna cost me like 300 bucks.
[171:34.81]But I just don't have the time.
[171:35.83]I can't fix anything on my own.
[171:40.73]Hold on.
[171:41.79]Bring in.
[171:42.23]Recycle.
[171:44.01]Bring in.
[171:45.33]There needs to be some... In The Sims 1, I always had a maid.
[171:50.73]A cleaning service.
[171:53.28]Everybody does.
[171:53.76]You have to do that like the first thing you do.
[171:56.42]So, unfortunately, I have to call.
[171:57.78]I have to do that too.
[172:01.26]If you don't have a cleaning service, it's not... Hello?
[172:17.00]Oh, lights!
[172:17.52]Right, right, right, right, right.
[172:18.38]Okay, so I need to have... Also, here's another thing.
[172:23.36]Another really important thing.
[172:24.77]There's no paint on the outside of the house.
[172:28.11]I think that's causing a shitload of problems.
[172:30.23]There's no paint!
[172:33.63]That's... They hate it here.
[172:38.25]Wallpaper.
[172:38.85]Do I have to have like a lime green house?
[172:42.56]This is too much money!
[172:43.42]I don't have enough money!
[172:48.84]windows it's 55 okay I can't afford this I can't afford it you need lights and windows I can't afford to buy these okay I got windows
[173:17.01]There is a roof.
[173:18.01]I know there's a roof.
[173:20.33]Whoa.
[173:20.65]There's light in here now.
[173:21.63]Holy shit.
[173:24.11]This is what the game is supposed to look like?
[173:25.37]Complete darkness.
[173:43.83]It's been pitch black the entire time I've been playing.
[173:47.78]Is that why they keep spilling shit?
[173:53.88]And getting water everywhere?
[173:55.50]That has to be.
[173:59.41]Okay.
[174:00.99]What time do I have to get up?
[174:07.08]First things first.
[174:07.68]You're going to get up and you're going to repair the sink.
[174:10.06]In fact, get up when you work.
[174:12.10]3 p.m.
[174:15.70]Alright, get up.
[174:18.38]Fix the sink.
[174:23.84]Oh.
[174:26.56]The cat let themselves in again.
[174:30.95]You can do it.
[174:32.21]Come on, do it.
[174:34.25]Come on.
[174:34.65]There's not much time.
[174:35.33]Go.
[174:37.52]Why do I feel like the cat just stole something?
[174:39.96]Alright, it's fixed.
[174:44.02]Sink is fixed.
[174:46.04]Step one.
[174:49.23]This sink needs to get... God damn it, I'm not even close to being ready.
[174:54.93]Use the bathroom.
[174:55.33]Oh my god.
[175:03.35]Ugh!
[175:07.46]Just call the neighbor and just fucking talk for five seconds and hang up.
[175:09.88]Call Johnny Burb, whoever.
[175:14.72]Do you want to invite?
[175:15.56]Just talk to Johnny.
[175:17.38]It's nice that you got to relax at home, but poor Johnny's at school.
[175:22.03]Oh, right.
[175:22.37]That's the kid.
[175:23.01]I'm never gonna get a promotion.
[175:27.71]At least the sink is fixed.
[175:33.03]Kid's home.
[175:33.76]Uh-oh, C.
[175:53.06]What is that?
[175:54.43]There are no actions.
[175:55.25]What is that?
[175:57.93]Oh, those are bills.
[176:00.71]Don't pay them.
[176:01.63]Just don't even pay them.
[176:02.17]Who cares?
[176:05.81]Seinfeld base?
[176:12.56]Oh my god, you fucking... I can't... Why would you even think that?
[176:20.41]Report card, C. It's only animals!
[176:26.41]This girl has only relationships with animals.
[176:29.69]No people.
[176:31.13]Call somebody over.
[176:31.97]Look, just throw a fucking party.
[176:36.01]Who cares?
[176:37.39]Maybe they'll clean up.
[176:50.37]Who am I calling to throw a party?
[176:57.11]Hey, thanks for the invite.
[176:57.95]Sounds great.
[176:58.45]I'll be right over with some friends.
[176:59.65]If you call some more people, we can have a really big bash.
[177:09.30]Throw another party?
[177:15.99]I need social.
[177:19.29]Where are the kids?
[177:46.22]no nothing don't like it dressed like this I'm trying to have fun this guy's in a tuxedo everybody's dressed up

[178:20.87]Fine, fuck off.
[178:21.17]I just made her cry.
[178:21.59]Okay.
[178:47.70]Everybody go home now.
[178:51.03]Oh my, what the fuck?
[178:55.45]What is that?
[179:13.64]Why is he screaming and pushing him?
[179:18.34]Mime?
[179:23.08]Appearing less and less frequently in this day and age.
[179:27.31]The mysterious mime.
[179:29.71]Why is that guy screaming?
[179:31.91]I can't get over it.
[179:32.61]I have to stop for a sec.
[179:35.55]The mysterious mime can be lured out from his den by the sound of people gathering.
[179:39.79]Strangely, he is compelled to entertain them.
[179:48.50]Where's this mime?
[179:50.26]Fuck.
[179:50.46]I want to see why he did that.
[179:55.34]Social's up at least.
[179:57.78]Is this a mime?
[180:17.30]Oh my god, this game is... There he is!
[180:19.82]It's a mime!
[180:23.23]Everybody get in!
[180:24.11]Everybody get inside!
[180:24.63]Um... What are you doing?
[180:25.97]Did the mime just steal my, like, magic wand machine?
[180:34.51]What?! !
[180:42.53]CALL THE POLICE! CALL THE POLICE! POLICE! POLICE! POLICE SERVICES! POLICE! POLICE! POLICE!
[180:49.88]Arrest him.
[180:53.04]He just stole something from my house. He stole my uh-
[181:09.81]Don't let this guy leave.
[181:10.47]Welcome home.
[181:10.93]Okay, you brought home 90 bucks.
[181:12.55]There's the police.
[181:14.47]Where are the cops?
[181:16.85]Alright, go, go, go, go.
[181:17.77]Get in there.
[181:39.89]Arrest that guy.
[181:42.89]Yes.
[181:43.27]Open the door.
[181:46.41]Yes.
[181:47.57]Go in there and arrest the mime.
[181:51.21]I'll hold the entire neighborhoods here.
[181:57.22]Yes.
[181:57.50]Hello.
[181:58.02]There he is.

[206:05.80]Then we're going to get out here.
[206:06.70]We're going to eat.
[206:08.70]We're going to play with the dogs.
[206:10.76]We're going to talk about interests.
[206:14.22]What just happened?
[206:22.80]No, no, no.
[206:22.98]Don't go to work.
[206:27.00]Okay.
[206:27.62]Go to sleep.
[206:28.48]Sleep.
[206:34.47]Forget about the phone.
[206:36.01]All I care about is the kid getting better grades.
[206:41.09]Look at this mess.
[206:53.14]Whatever.
[206:54.68]It doesn't matter.
[206:55.22]I don't need that right now.

[207:27.14]You're not supposed to eat that.
[207:28.10]That's ours.
[207:41.00]This guy came in to ate a plate.
[207:45.34]Get him out of here.
[207:50.25]Goodbye.
[207:50.73]Get out.
[207:51.37]Get out.
[207:51.67]Just leave.
[207:52.83]I just mopped this shit up and now you just did that.
[207:55.00]Unless you're gonna fix this thing, then fucking get out of here.

[208:06.69]Okay.
[208:09.03]Now we just need to... We're going to have some more fun.
[208:10.87]Sit down and watch TV.

[208:18.58]Stay there and watch.
[208:19.62]Don't get up.
[208:24.24]Stay here.
[208:24.82]Why are the flies just...

[209:02.33]She's doing good.
[209:04.63]Alright, turn off the TV.

[209:24.04]Mom will get up.
[209:24.52]We'll make breakfast.

[210:30.37]Alright, mom, get up.
[210:35.73]Mom, I want you to clean.
[210:37.34]Clean this all up.

[210:43.08]Kid's asleep.

[211:55.12]I want you to have a full stomach.
[211:56.08]That's how you get good grades.
[211:58.60]It's not about studying all night the night before.
[212:00.36]It's making sure the morning of your test you have a full breakfast.
[212:16.64]It's no time for you to take a shower, I don't think.
[212:18.18]Alright, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[212:22.92]This is not time.
[212:25.92]This bed's underwater!

[213:01.11]That's not a bad mood.
[213:01.93]That mood is fine.
[213:04.49]We did it.
[213:05.63]This kid is now in a better position.
[213:10.53]Alright.
[213:20.16]House still has no roof.
[213:21.18]The house has a roof.
[213:22.94]How do I get rid of these flies?
[213:25.91]Clean the toilet.
[213:32.53]Clean this room up.
[213:34.03]Repair the sink again.
[213:35.54]No, no, no, no, no.
[213:37.66]Repair, man.
[213:39.56]I don't have time to do all this.
[213:49.13]Sink is repaired.

[214:16.58]Too much.
[214:28.50]Okay, everything's fixed in here.
[214:30.80]Okay, this is clean.
[214:38.76]Why are these flies just flying around?
[214:40.54]Get them out of here.
[214:42.16]What's going on?
[214:46.06]Everything's clean in here.
[214:49.66]Make her woohoo.
[214:51.20]Woohoo what?
[214:58.75]This is all so I don't lose the kid.
[215:02.85]Go to Woohoo Island.
[215:04.31]Okay.
[215:16.24]Now... Hygiene...
[215:20.80]Why am I doing this?
[215:21.46]Because there's a kid... Alright, I'm going to be honest with you.
[215:23.64]The kids in The Sims, if you have a kid in the house, they're just... It's just like an empty sink.
[215:30.72]It's just like a money sink.
[215:33.12]They just go to school, they eat, and they... I can't afford it.
[215:44.14]There's dead plants outside.
[215:56.68]Comfort fun.
[215:58.10]I need to get like a pinball machine.
[215:59.62]I don't know who you are, but hi.
[216:06.57]Can we hang out for a little bit?
[216:13.39]Yes, let's sit on the couch and hang out and talk.
[216:15.19]Let's just hang out with this person.
[216:16.07]I don't even know who this person is, but hello.
[216:18.70]Come on in.
[216:23.74]She's doing fine.
[216:29.92]Alright.
[216:30.92]Should I go?
[216:31.52]Should I take him into town?
[216:34.32]No, you don't have school till tomorrow.
[216:35.94]Did I just jump in the hole?
[216:39.86]Oh, he grades.
[216:47.13]Shit.
[216:47.95]Shit.
[216:57.42]Jump in the hole.
[216:57.92]No, I can't look at these bars.
[217:02.45]Study?
[217:03.83]Alright, go study.
[217:06.35]Yes.
[217:06.57]Oh my god, what do I do?
[217:09.91]How do I make anybody happy in this game?
[217:11.53]There's bugs and shit.
[217:20.26]What?
[217:20.56]No.
[217:22.12]She's getting attacked by bugs.
[217:27.38]She can't move I
[218:00.65]Jump in the hole now?
[218:01.97]With the kid?
[218:02.49]Alright, we're gonna... What about this house I did?
[218:08.22]This is why The Sims 1 is so hard.
[218:11.14]You have to make... Your first house in Sims 1 can be one fucking square cube with a fridge and a bed.
[218:18.44]And you can't have more than two people.
[218:23.82]We're moving.
[218:26.12]What?
[218:54.50]Where can I take you today?
[218:56.16]Show amusement parks?
[219:02.64]Whoa!
[219:03.66]Clown land!
[219:15.95]Wow!
[219:16.85]Holy shit, look at this place!
[219:18.67]Look at my fucking bars!
[219:20.19]I just screamed so loud.
[219:22.09]That was like a tuberous scream.
[219:23.09]I'm sorry.
[219:26.72]Holy shit.
[219:29.35]Get on this ride.
[219:29.87]I wonder how much it is.

[220:11.78]I missed school.
[220:14.70]I skipped school to go to the amusement park.
[220:27.91]It was $20?
[220:30.95]This ride is crazy.
[220:32.15]View.
[220:34.83]Look at the clown!
[220:35.53]Did you see the clown?
[220:46.40]Last day of fun before military school.
[220:54.84]God.
[220:56.81]Franchberries.
[220:57.63]Ah, nice.
[220:58.15]I think it would hurt.
[221:05.83]Okay, is there like a comfort machine?
[221:13.21]I need to bring mom here.
[221:15.85]Cotton candy?
[221:21.79]Whoa, that was awesome.
[221:24.91]What do you mean I was wrong?
[221:25.65]Take a look at what's going on right now.
[221:27.89]I'm fine.
[221:28.27]This guy's kind of weird.
[221:31.63]Where you going?
[221:32.41]Where's she going?
[221:34.69]What is she doing?
[221:35.53]She's like dazed?
[221:37.55]Oh no, she's going to look at the clown.
[221:59.52]That's okay.
[222:00.08]Well, that was stupid.
[222:05.10]What else is here?
[222:05.78]There's this big roller coaster thing.
[222:09.18]I need comfort.
[222:11.82]You, popcorn.
[222:12.70]I want a cotton candy.
[222:24.63]We're wrong.
[222:25.27]I'm not wrong.
[222:25.85]Look at how much fun this is.
[222:29.23]Look, I'm going to send the mom on like vacation or something.
[222:32.06]Can I live alone in the house as a kid?
[222:56.37]Alright, now what else is over here?
[222:59.06]Whoa, look at this.
[223:00.72]Play this machine.
[223:01.78]This is fun.

[223:17.49]Oh.
[223:17.59]Oh.
[223:27.16]They who spin in circles are without a route, and have wandered from the path.
[223:31.27]They need guidance, but be wary of getting in the way.
[223:34.49]You need guidance, but be wary of the obstacles in your way.
[223:37.75]Insert another coin, I'll tell you more.
[223:39.23]I should have just read that as Rick.
[223:44.62]It would have made sense.
[223:45.68]It would have been like a Rickism.
[223:59.62]Are you tired or are you weary?
[224:00.78]Does life feel drab and dreary?
[224:02.54]Pick your motives up, my friend.
[224:04.02]I see fun plus plus around the bend.
[224:05.74]Insert another coin.

[224:38.50]Somebody alright?
[224:39.27]What happened?
[224:40.27]Dude's fucking screaming.
[224:58.84]Your child has created a fake reality to cope with the fact that her true life is pure pain.
[225:04.11]This is your fault.
[225:06.05]This is like, wait, a coping?
[225:12.86]She's like walking around the living room right now?
[225:14.64]How's my social?
[225:18.12]I need to bring the mother here.
[225:28.04]She's got to go back.
[225:28.72]She's got school tomorrow.
[225:31.58]You got school tomorrow.
[225:32.26]Go.
[225:34.50]That was fun.
[225:35.23]Look at that fun meter.
[225:35.99]You got to leave.
[225:38.85]Back home.
[226:02.73]It really was just like a made-up world.
[226:05.97]This is... Shit, I have to restart.
[226:10.37]Oh, God.
[226:11.63]No, I have to redo it.
[226:15.91]Fuck!
[226:16.37]Okay, fine.
[226:17.59]I'm leaving.
[226:19.21]I'm making a new family, and we'll see how these people do with my new family.
[226:24.33]They'll be in the same neighborhood, whatever.
[226:26.05]I'm gonna just make a tiny little fucking stupid house.
[226:28.86]What are you doing?
[226:29.38]Ow!

[228:34.83]I did not ruin anything.
[228:36.74]The crafted gnome is a magical asset to any garden.
[228:39.56]He who denies the gnome its green thumb accepts the black and blue shin.
[228:42.68]I need another coin.
[228:44.06]Oh, cool.
[228:51.69]What's this?
[228:57.03]Don't deny the gnome.

[267:32.49]he doubt him around taking me out the cuckoo Milano comey
[268:09.22]Just holding up traffic.

[268:15.04]Alright, get this guy out of here.
[268:25.42]Ow!
[268:26.38]Alright, kick this guy's ass.
[268:28.48]I'm not gonna get slapped more than once.
[268:30.41]You know what I mean?
[268:31.29]You slap me once, shame on me.
[268:33.57]Slap me twice, say goodnight, because you're gonna get knocked out.

[269:07.91]You don't like that I'm way better than you?
[269:12.19]I am so much fucking cooler than you.
[269:13.57]I'm so much stronger than you.
[269:14.74]Just wait till I get my ability to punch him.
[269:24.92]Wait, no, no, don't leave.
[269:34.49]She has to pee.
[269:36.33]Oh, right.
[269:36.69]Okay.
[269:37.01]Minus 37.
[269:37.31]When can I punch him?
[269:39.61]Minus 37.
[269:40.87]When am I able to attack him?
[269:42.55]Here we go.
[269:42.79]Attack!
[269:42.97]Attack!
[270:03.21]What do you think about this one, Mortimer Goth?
[270:07.67]Push him into a car.
[270:11.81]He's trying to leave.
[270:12.31]Sorry, you don't get to leave.
[270:14.63]After walking over and slapping me in the face, you don't get to leave.
[270:19.84]Oh, this is just really, really weak.
[270:27.36]That's not... I feel like you could push me over and I would die.
[270:33.55]How come there's more than this, right?
[270:36.37]How do I punch him?
[270:38.91]I want to attack him.
[270:58.65]You're bullying.
[271:00.91]I'm sorry.
[271:01.33]I was just sitting here having a conversation with his wife.
[271:06.41]And then he came over and hit me in the face.
[271:10.35]So, what?
[271:12.07]He came over and he hit me in the face twice.
[271:14.03]It was not just once, it was twice.
[271:16.23]I think you have to be like minus 50 or minus 100 to actually punch him.
[271:29.69]See, if I can't do it here, then I'm just going to let him go.
[271:32.95]No, whatever.
[271:33.73]Fuck him.
[271:33.95]Who cares?
[271:34.19]Alright, let's go hang out.
[271:34.81]Get chocolates for somebody.
[272:03.34]Going back in here?
[272:09.50]That's not attractive.
[272:19.02]That's not attractive.
[272:21.91]Try on.
[272:22.67]Wait, can we put on costumes?
[272:35.23]So anyways, I think you're really cute.
[272:41.52]How is this somehow worse?
[273:14.10]Is someone on the ground?
[273:16.76]Oh, shit.
[273:17.48]I thought this person was on the ground.
[273:18.78]Alright, what about Claire?
[273:21.46]Should we go say hello?
[273:22.28]I need to make friends.
[273:24.34]Claire.
[273:25.75]I need to greet a bunch of people.
[273:29.37]Fish food?
[273:30.03]Rent?
[273:31.69]Wait, is this Mortimer?
[273:32.57]No.
[273:36.18]No, stay on... No, what are you...
[273:39.89]Where am I?
[273:40.27]What am I doing?
[273:43.98]Get out of here.
[273:45.02]Are you interested in purchasing this outfit?
[273:46.74]Yes.
[273:46.96]That'd be less than $50.
[273:51.36]He teased.
[273:51.84]He was just going to come in here and be like...
[274:14.47]Ooh.
[274:15.35]Buy hot dogs.
[274:26.14]Forget about this guy.
[274:27.04]I don't know where the hell he is.
[274:28.28]I need a hot dog.
[274:29.20]She's following me around.
[274:31.06]Hmm.
[274:43.13]Are we buying hot dogs together?
[274:47.78]We're on a date.
[274:48.92]Wait, did she just buy me a hot dog?
[274:51.08]Should I grill the hot dog again?
[275:17.24]Okay, so let's talk.
[275:18.20]How you doing?
[275:19.67]38.
[275:21.11]Mortimer's not here.
[275:23.17]Alright, that's going good.
[275:24.39]41.
[275:24.41]He's pissed.
[275:24.75]He just senses it.
[275:27.13]He's slapped.
[275:50.74]Awesome.
[275:53.32]Okay.
[275:53.84]We're going to be over 50 in a second.
[275:56.97]There it is.
[275:57.27]Okay.
[275:59.45]Hug.
[276:18.65]I don't want to do it.
[276:19.43]I don't want to go too much.
[276:26.58]She didn't like that apparently.
[276:29.58]I don't think it's going to work.
[276:37.87]I don't think she's into us.
[276:40.31]Into us.
[276:41.59]Why am I making this like a collective all of us?
[276:43.71]She's not into us.
[276:59.40]No, she's not, no, she's not, it's not gonna happen.
[277:02.24]That's it.
[277:07.70]She's not into us.
[277:12.77]We were at 50, it was worth a shot to be like, hey, so, you know, nope.
[277:20.01]Not gonna happen.
[277:23.35]Why is it trash everywhere?
[277:28.27]What the fuck?
[277:28.78]I'm devastated.
[277:29.96]It's a married woman, guys.
[277:43.99]You going upstairs?
[277:44.57]Oh, it's like a party.
[277:50.33]I need to eat something.
[277:51.43]Hey, friends.
[277:51.87]I need to, like, come across people.
[277:53.35]I drink.
[277:53.99]These for us?
[278:19.10]You might need to get rid of Mortimer first.
[278:22.72]I just want to see if we're... Are you talking about I need to kill Mortimer?
[278:33.25]I just loaded this game up with this file.
[278:39.09]I need to get a job first.
[278:41.34]I've burnt through like $600 somehow.
[278:55.28]Kenny's way more fun.
[278:57.02]Who's this guy?
[278:58.78]How long are we gonna do this for?
[279:03.74]Alright, greet Kenny.
[279:31.21]Alright, you get out of here.
[279:37.71]No, just wave.
[279:38.67]Alright, bye.
[279:46.58]That was really fun.
[279:47.14]Let's get together again soon.
[279:48.26]I don't think so.
[279:51.22]I don't think that's going to happen.
[279:52.12]Hey, your husband's really like a swell guy, by the way.
[280:01.23]We're just like dancing.
[280:03.93]This is so- I love this.

[283:07.58]Okay.
[283:07.78]Alright.
[283:10.28]Get in the bed.
[283:10.70]Go to sleep.
[283:14.29]Oh, no.
[283:14.69]A skunk.
[283:15.29]Whatever.
[283:21.61]The energy is going up crazy.
[283:23.45]Okay.
[283:27.89]Do I get a job now?
[283:33.53]Fight the skunk one-on-one.
[283:34.53]I don't think you can.
[283:37.97]I'm going to flush.
[283:39.53]And then I'm going to clean it.
[283:40.39]And then I'm going to use it.
[283:41.33]And then I'm going to take a shower.
[283:44.31]And then I'm going to study cooking.
[283:48.43]That sounds like a good idea.
[283:49.23]Let's go.
[283:59.76]Then queue it up.
[284:03.54]What's wrong?
[284:09.05]What is that?
[284:13.49]It's a raccoon.
[284:16.20]Well, whatever.
[284:16.64]I don't care.
[284:19.26]It's a lobster?
[284:20.16]He's just going to come knock the trash over.
[284:25.69]It's fine.
[284:33.45]Too depressed to study.
[284:34.41]Alright, well then watch TV.
[284:41.65]Turn on the TV and get some fun in your life.
[284:47.86]Hang out, watch a movie.
[284:53.54]What?
[284:56.64]Go watch a movie.
[284:57.98]Go watch TV.
[285:02.60]Watch TV, man.
[285:03.92]Watch the romance.
[285:07.14]Okay.
[285:19.03]I keep buying snacks and putting them on the ground.
[285:31.31]Is this like a dinner?
[285:35.95]Shitbags.
[285:40.03]Okay.
[285:44.13]Now, study cooking.
[285:47.86]You're flatlining.
[285:57.73]I have to do at least one to two cooking.
[285:59.33]Otherwise, I'm going to burn the house down.
[286:00.51]It's going to happen every time.
[286:01.37]That's how The Sims 1 works.
[286:07.43]Plenty of energy.
[286:07.93]There we go.
[286:09.15]One point in cooking.
[286:10.15]Get two.
[286:13.66]Go for three points, actually.
[286:17.46]Two points.
[286:17.98]Go for the third point.
[286:20.00]And then I won't burn the house down anymore.
[286:27.59]Get it.
[286:29.15]There it is.
[286:29.59]Nice.
[286:29.83]Alright.
[286:30.91]I got three cooking points.
[286:32.25]Time to be a chef.
[286:38.43]Okay.
[286:39.88]Let's put that down.
[286:43.82]Flush it.
[286:44.78]Clean it.
[286:47.02]Take a shower.
[286:47.62]Flush it.
[286:49.88]Clean it.
[286:50.48]Use it.
[286:54.48]Then use it and take a shower.
[286:57.17]And after that, make, have lunch, clean up, recycle, go to bed.
[287:08.48]And then I'm going to get another point in cooking tomorrow.
[287:10.84]I'm going to be a chef.
[287:13.46]I'm into that.
[287:17.26]Look, only me to have to worry about.
[287:18.82]There's not like a kid running around that I have to feed.
[287:22.12]It's just me.
[287:23.58]I can worry about my own bars.
[287:25.22]There's no like husband or wife.
[287:28.34]It's just me.
[287:30.78]Otto?
[287:34.00]Otto!
[287:34.38]No!
[287:34.58]No!
[287:35.74]It's Otto!
[288:03.20]Get out there!
[288:07.62]It really is Otto.
[288:10.10]Otto!
[288:13.95]He fought the raccoon.
[288:14.95]He got the raccoon away from the host.
[288:16.17]This is perfect.
[288:17.09]Alright, you and I are going to be best friends.
[288:19.07]I don't care whose dog you are.
[288:26.29]Oh, Otto.
[288:26.63]Where's Otto on here?
[288:27.15]Praise Otto.
[288:27.67]Leroy.
[288:27.89]Leroy Hick?
[288:29.41]Well, at least I know Leroy Hick.
[288:59.58]Leroy is a class clown with a sense of humor.
[289:06.10]Playing chase is his favorite activity.
[289:10.43]Okay.
[289:10.59]Get back in here.
[289:12.71]I need... Turn off the TV.
[289:18.21]Clean up.
[289:22.72]Didn't I have... Where's my lunch?
[289:30.71]Come on.
[289:33.43]I have three cooking.
[289:34.19]I want to get to a point where I have just folks on my bars.
[289:36.90]That's it.
[289:43.26]There should be no fire anymore.
[289:44.86]What's the percentage to have a fire after like two or three points?
[289:54.97]Look at how much more that does.
[289:56.03]That's so much better.
[289:59.13]And now I'm going to go clean this.
[290:02.28]This needs to be cleaned every day.
[290:05.64]What kind of monstrous dumps am I doing?
[290:08.90]I need to clean the toilet every day.
[290:10.78]Go to sleep.
[290:22.35]And then we're going to do cooking again tomorrow.
[290:24.99]Then I'm going to try to find a chef job.
[290:31.46]I want Otto to be my best friend.
[290:41.09]Will he stick around?
[291:03.05]Praise Otto.
[291:03.99]That's so funny that it actually is Otto.
[291:06.75]Good boy.
[291:06.99]Do I get any new interactions after like 20 or 30?
[291:10.39]Alright, I gotta go to bed.
[291:12.39]Alright, we'll see you tomorrow.
[291:16.76]See you tomorrow.
[291:32.73]Get in there and go to sleep.
[291:40.61]Okay.
[291:47.51]Comfort is good.
[291:48.23]Energy is good.
[291:49.19]I want to get to four or five cooking so then I can get the chef job.
[291:52.42]Do I need the computer?
[291:54.48]Why are your plants going to die?
[291:56.26]Shit, you're right.
[291:59.28]I'm gonna get up, make dinner, clean this shit up, whatever this is.
[292:02.80]I must not have finished.
[292:06.50]And I'm gonna go swimming.
[292:08.92]Let's play.
[292:30.57]Buns of steel and washboard abs.
[292:31.95]Jerma received one body skill point.
[292:34.95]Really?
[292:38.60]Body?
[292:41.66]Swimming and working on the exercise.
[292:42.58]Do body skills especially value in the pro athlete and military career?
[292:45.52]Huh.
[292:49.16]Very cool.
[292:49.72]Nice.
[292:53.64]I should invite somebody over for a pool party.
[293:00.43]Jeff.
[293:03.33]Politics career.
[293:05.33]No.
[293:06.41]I don't think so.
[293:11.82]Toadstools?
[293:12.70]Toad sweat?
[293:14.48]Magic coins?
[293:15.32]I don't know what any of this shit does.
[293:19.12]I gotta pee again.
[293:19.76]Alright, I'm gonna pee one more time.
[293:21.16]We'll come back and we'll keep going.
[293:21.98]I'll be right back.
[296:41.99]Okay, hello.
[296:45.38]Uh, so we will be continuing this tomorrow.
[296:50.56]I did say that sometimes it'll be two streams in a row.
[296:52.86]Tomorrow is one of those cases.
[296:58.05]Uh, because I want to keep playing.
[297:01.33]I want to at least try to get at least a decent part of the game.
[297:06.97]So.
[297:08.19]We'll be playing Sims 1 again tomorrow.
[297:10.67]Not done yet.
[297:12.11]Tonight, by the way.
[297:15.09]But, let's go back where we were.
[297:21.49]Here we are.
[297:25.45]Play the coin game?
[297:27.03]Is there another coin game update?
[297:35.76]It was?
[297:36.18]It was?
[297:39.09]Is it more than what I played last time?
[297:42.83]Gonna get sucked back into The Sims?
[297:45.13]No, I just kind of, I mean, look.
[297:47.43]I did like the meme playthrough.
[297:51.07]I didn't mean to have that be a meme playthrough, but it ended up as one.
[297:54.29]Now, I'd like to see how far I can take Jerma Elbertson over the next day.
[298:00.16]Alright, so where am I going?
[298:09.76]I have, I want to get the, I need a computer.
[298:13.57]How much is a computer?
[298:15.39]Can't you search for a specific job on the computer?
[298:20.29]You can, right?
[298:28.96]Will I water all of them or no?
[298:30.18]Okay.
[298:37.79]Uh, I need a computer.
[298:44.00]Just a little one.
[298:44.86]Can I afford one?
[298:48.74]Shit, I can't.
[298:49.88]I can't afford a computer.
[298:51.04]Is there a library?
[298:58.19]Really?
[299:04.17]Phone.
[299:06.13]All cab services.

[299:10.24]Row party.
[299:11.94]Call neighbor.
[299:12.56]Nah, damn it.
[299:17.37]Use a library computer?
[299:20.60]Does that actually exist?
[299:25.12]Can I do that?
[299:31.04]The newspaper?
[299:31.69]Yeah, the newspaper has one job a day.
[299:41.47]Eat more food.
[299:42.09]Make another one.
[299:45.93]Maybe not.
[299:46.23]Alright, should I study cooking?
[299:48.07]Alright, here's what we're going to do.
[299:51.85]Why am I not flushing the toilet?
[299:54.08]You guys notice that?
[299:56.02]Is there a reason why I'm not flushing the toilet?
[299:58.82]Why?
[299:58.96]I'm the only one here.
[300:01.78]I'm going to have to clean it because it's gross.
[300:05.98]This happens every day.
[300:12.95]Oh, neatness.
[300:16.01]I don't know, I'm not the neatest person in the world and I'm pretty sloppy and... I flush the toilet after I take a shit in the toilet.
[300:31.38]Clean that up and then clean this.
[300:40.38]If it's yellow, let it mellow.
[300:42.32]You know, I've heard that term before, but here's the problem.
[300:47.10]Piss stinks, and it stains the toilet bowl.
[300:54.69]Oh, I don't know.
[300:56.07]I'm not sure I agree with that one.
[301:03.97]It stinks.
[301:04.43]Wait a minute.
[301:04.73]I'm getting question marks.
[301:05.65]Why?
[301:05.79]Okay.
[301:08.89]Your pee smells.
[301:11.40]If you do like a full piss into a toilet and it's like yellow, smelly pee, it stinks.
[301:17.54]It's not... What are you talking about?
[301:20.64]Drink more water.
[301:21.34]I drink plenty of water.
[301:24.30]This doesn't happen every day.
[301:25.46]Need to drink more.
[301:28.33]My pee is fine.
[301:29.65]I'm fine.
[301:31.87]Pee stinks!
[301:41.11]Uh-oh, there's a cat fight.
[301:46.14]Never mind.
[301:46.48]I jumped to conclusions there.
[301:48.16]Alright, watch some TV for a little bit.
[301:52.74]Get that fun meter up.
[301:55.38]What was that?
[302:03.66]Ah, it's Tiffany, whatever.
[302:08.97]I am going to need a job, though.
[302:15.25]More fun, more fun, more fun, more fun.
[302:18.98]More fun, more fun.
[302:22.24]Go ahead and dive in.
[302:25.20]And study cooking again.
[302:26.18]Did I invite somebody over?
[302:33.40]Where's the newspaper?
[302:42.02]Throw a pool party?
[302:42.82]Alright, I'm gonna study cooking, I'm gonna serve dinner, and then have a party.
[302:51.03]Clean up a little bit.
[302:58.94]Oh, can he over?
[302:59.54]Oh, absolutely.
[303:00.20]There we go.
[303:06.40]Alright, now we got a clean house.
[303:08.55]Be begged.
[303:14.45]You better invite Kenny.
[303:15.85]Why would I not invite Kenny?
[303:18.61]Why do I hate it out here so much?
[303:19.83]Oh, they're going to drag me away.
[303:31.18]Why do I hate it out here?
[303:32.14]This is a nice garden.
[303:43.09]It's ugly?
[303:44.41]It's not ugly out here.
[303:45.39]Brush the toilet, you fucking maniac!
[304:02.67]You just dumped on top of a dump.
[304:06.42]That is fucking rancid!
[304:08.52]That's disgusting.
[304:17.72]Now let's take a shower, get some sleep, and then tomorrow I'm going to get cooking skill and throw a party.
[304:24.47]7 a.m., 8 a.m., 9 a.m., good.
[304:33.67]Turn this TV off.

[362:59.06]I can't get this bar to go up.

[364:15.13]What happened?
[364:15.89]I thought something bad happened.
[364:18.21]Social, come on!
[364:39.49]Well, that's good enough, I guess.
[364:46.25]You're too underleveled for this area.
[364:50.44]Alright, I'm fucking off back to home.
[364:57.50]Get me out of here.
[365:03.01]What?

[366:12.50]I'm not done with this.
[366:14.14]I want to come back tomorrow.
[366:16.00]So tomorrow around, probably the same time around noon, we'll continue.
[366:21.36]And when I come back next time, I'm going to be ready.
[366:23.33]I'm going to get married.
[366:24.93]It's going to be a lot of fun.

[367:22.20]Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
[367:36.00]Invite people over.
[367:37.18]I don't think I... There's no phone in there, though.
[367:42.36]Alright, everything's saved.
[367:43.16]It's all good.
[367:46.84]That's gonna be what we call it here.
[367:52.95]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[367:53.67]We'll see you tomorrow.
[367:54.79]It was a shitload of subs.
[367:55.93]A shitload of community subs.
[367:57.48]I missed SlimeClown gave 20.
[368:03.12]Uncle Ossie gave 5.
[368:04.72]Onimos gave 5 as well.
[368:05.96]Thanks, guys.
[368:07.56]See you tomorrow.
[368:08.20]Same time.
[368:08.57]That was a lot of fun.
[368:11.25]I forgot how difficult The Sims 1 actually is.
[368:15.23]We're going to get through it.
[368:16.25]At least some of it tomorrow.
[368:17.11]See you then.
[368:20.59]We're going to do the credits.
[368:21.47]The credits are probably going to be insane.
[368:22.89]Let's take a look.
[368:30.16]Okay.
[368:36.58]Let's see.
[368:39.08]What happened?
[368:39.92]Whoa.
[368:43.66]It broke.
[368:44.21]I think I broke it.
[368:53.98]Too many to show, it just- wow.
[368:59.44]These are people that subbed today.
[369:00.96]This doesn't- this doesn't, like, feel, like, right, you know what I mean?
[369:08.59]That's, like, so many people.
[369:10.07]I can't fucking believe this shit, it's insane.
[369:20.66]It's all resubs.
[369:21.68]I know, it's still, it's just, that's bonkers.
[369:26.94]Well, we'll see you tomorrow.
[369:27.96]Thanks, everybody.
[369:30.24]Tomorrow will be more progress.
[369:32.41]I feel like the first three or four hours was just zero.
[369:38.37]We went to negative progress in the first three hours.
[369:49.42]And I will have some, not tomorrow, but probably next week.
[369:54.04]There should be more Grotto Beasts stuff to talk about.
[369:57.50]Among maybe a couple other things.
[369:59.86]So stay tuned for that too.
[370:01.78]Once a week, Andy, you know.
[370:02.76]A lot of things can happen in a week.
[370:11.55]The title of the stream is The Old One?
[370:15.49]Oh, like The Sims.
[370:16.33]Like the old Sims game, right?
[370:17.63]Okay.
[370:22.92]Roto beast pog.
[370:25.46]Yeah.
[370:28.58]Did the bot thing affect you?
[370:31.68]Um.
[370:32.72]What bot thing?
[370:34.72]What bot thing?
[370:39.16]What's the bot thing?
[370:47.72]It killed a bunch of view bots.
[370:49.30]Um.
[370:51.34]I don't know.
[370:53.63]Did I have... How many followers do I have right now?
[370:56.99]I have 523,000.
[370:57.43]What did I have a week ago?
[371:04.47]I don't think it... Looks like it affected me that much.
[371:06.74]523,000.
[371:13.50]Whatever it was like two weeks ago.
[371:14.54]I don't know.
[371:23.70]They only removed bots from 15 streamers.
[371:26.40]Really?
[371:26.68]That's weird.
[371:27.18]Twitch basically dealt with a bunch of bot issues, and thus the bot problem.
[371:32.02]So many channels might see a decrease in subs due to Twitch removing a bunch of bot accounts.
[371:37.48]Wait, like subbed bots?
[371:39.64]Sub bots?
[371:42.39]I lost like 3,000.
[371:42.81]Oh.
[371:43.13]Well, that doesn't seem like very much.
[371:51.39]xQc lost 1.5 million followers.
[371:54.21]Holy shit.
[372:08.95]Followers, not subs.
[372:09.97]Yeah, it's still a lot though.
[372:18.20]Don't forget your bedtime.
[372:20.44]Well, you said something else, but thank you.
[372:22.18]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[372:25.72]Same time, around 12 Pacific.
[372:27.06]I'm going to continue The Sims 1.
[372:28.66]I'm going to play through that and see if I can maybe get a family.
[372:31.96]We'll see.
[372:32.23]See you tomorrow.
[372:34.51]Good night.
[372:35.05]Goodbye.
[372:35.37]Take care, guys.
