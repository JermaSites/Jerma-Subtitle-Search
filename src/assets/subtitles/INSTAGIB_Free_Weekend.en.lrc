[04:02.28]Um, I'm gonna play some rats.
[04:04.71]I don't know.
[04:06.73]I don't know for how long.
[04:07.97]I don't know for how when, how what.
[04:12.15]Let's play some rats.
[04:15.97]Oh, it's on the window.
[04:25.68]There.
[04:27.42]We're good to go.
[04:29.72]I want to do rats.
[04:30.85]I want to do rats.
[04:33.69]In the bum bum.
[04:34.77]Hopefully there's people playing.
[04:35.81]I'd have to assume so because it's a free weekend and all that stuff.
[04:39.99]And if there's no one playing, I recommend you download it.
[04:44.25]We'll play it.
[04:46.50]Guaco.
[04:48.92]I know well done.
[04:49.70]I know.
[04:51.56]I haven't played this in crazy, crazy, crazy.
[04:55.38]Last time I played it was the last time I streamed it, which was in like May, I think, when I was doing the whole streaming thing.
[05:01.33]So...
[05:03.01]Let's see if we can even insta-gib.
[05:04.43]I don't remember how to strafe and all that.
[05:12.99]It is very different than things like TF2.
[05:15.27]It's not doing too bad to start, though.
[05:22.62]I feel.
[05:23.86]Tammy.
[05:26.86]I also think most of the people playing are like... They're not rats professionals, if you know what I mean.
[05:36.15]I'm not going to any grand championships anytime soon.
[05:39.40]My chair is all wrong.
[05:44.24]It's still give, but it's not instant.
[05:47.82]How amateur.
[05:52.05]You can like zoom in now too.
[05:54.17]It's totally bonkers.
[05:55.23]I don't really like doing it.
[06:01.64]Actually, I'm not used to it, and it's like a press toggle.
[06:04.89]I would rather press and hold it.
[06:06.25]I don't know why.
[06:08.05]It's probably inconvenient to do that, but I'd still rather get it.
[06:10.37]I don't like it.
[06:14.50]I think my sensitivity is way too high while I'm in the zoomed in mode.
[06:18.20]That's a new thing.
[06:22.47]since I last played.
[06:23.31]They're also talking about a map editor coming out, which would be really cool.
[06:26.59]I like map editors.
[06:27.43]I think I brought that up on last night's stream.
[06:30.30]It would just be fun to make something.
[06:32.24]Maybe a rooftop map or something as well.
[06:55.71]My sensitivity is crazy high.
[06:57.71]Fall like that.
[06:59.51]I know there's an option to lower it.
[07:01.61]Just for zooming.
[07:04.07]So I should probably do that.
[07:09.46]What if I do that?
[07:10.10]What if I lose the round?
[07:11.06]I'm only ahead by like two.
[07:13.70]Where am I?
[07:21.05]Which one is it?
[07:29.11]I don't even care, I'm not even going to zoom that often.
[07:31.18]Game looks fun actually.
[07:46.12]For Mario Maker.
[07:46.92]That game does look funny.
[07:49.26]I would actually like to play it.
[07:51.80]We do have a Wii.
[07:52.66]I could actually get it.
[07:54.86]We have a whole Wi-Fi thing set up too, so we could actually like set up the Wii and download it.
[07:58.78]I wouldn't be able to stream it.
[08:01.52]You need like a capture card and shit for that.
[08:05.18]It definitely wouldn't be on this side of the apartment.
[08:18.34]That's also a really awkward button.
[08:22.56]If Jarmo comes over, we could have a tournament.
[08:26.97]But like, who can make the best level or just play it?
[08:37.36]Thanks, Ms.
[08:37.78]Pauling.
[08:38.22]Also known as her alias, Oxidoxal Movies?
[08:42.70]Oxi-Ox-Boxel-Ball-Door Movies?
[08:52.03]I'm sure I will make maps for this game.
[08:54.23]Oh, there's a new one.
[08:56.36]Rooftop one.
[08:58.94]The Mirror's Edge Stage.
[09:09.89]Oh, and special guest joining us.
[09:14.05]Hey.
[09:14.63]Special guest to Jerma985 from YouTube channel Jerma985.
[09:18.11]You hear the audience applaud.
[09:20.08]Yes, yes.
[09:20.86]Thank you.
[09:21.58]Hold your applause, please.
[09:22.86]From very important topics to talk about tonight.
[09:24.98]Live from New York.
[09:26.74]No, it's great to be here.
[09:29.78]It's great to be here.
[09:32.03]How are your arms?
[09:32.89]You flew all the way here?
[09:33.65]Yeah, well, I mean, I got that movie coming out, so that's one of the things we've been doing.
[09:40.39]Can we take a look at a clip of that movie right now?
[09:43.84]Yeah, I mean, I thought we were going to talk about it a little bit, but yeah, sure, go ahead and show it.
[09:49.63]It looks like it's rats aced again.
[09:51.99]Yep.
[09:53.47]I play all the rats.
[09:54.35]Funny story, on set, it was a little joke between all of us guys and girls there.
[10:01.76]We would sing this song.
[10:03.28]It was a little song we made up.
[10:05.12]It was like, rats...
[10:06.96]we're gonna get you where the rats we're gonna get you where the rats and I thought we you know no yeah yeah yeah that's great so um I hear your audience this audience is crap I can't even hear they're laughing so hard so you're gonna have to speak up the applause is just it's it's too much we're trying to keep up with it I don't I don't think our sound systems are capturing all properly because it's you know like when someone screams on a stream and it cuts out for a second oh yeah that's what's happening you're not hearing most of the audience they still are just going crazy
[10:37.03]Can I fit in these pipes?
[10:39.47]I mean, can you fit in these pipes?
[10:40.75]I'm sorry, I still can't hear you.
[10:43.55]They need to stop laughing so loud.
[10:45.91]It wasn't that funny.
[10:49.21]Yeah, okay.
[10:50.41]Yeah, it's funny.
[10:52.06]I'm gonna go.
[10:55.42]This fucking audience is too loud.
[10:59.30]I really wish I had that clip of that video that one guy always shows on Conan.
[11:04.30]Whatever.
[11:05.80]Oh, the Mac and Mute fallback.
[11:07.26]If I had Mac and Mute ready, I so would have played it there.
[11:10.71]That'd be hard to get ready, though.
[11:18.23]After, like... Mute just lost his mind right there.
[11:22.05]He's just like, no, no, no, no!
[11:24.15]No one cares.
[11:26.95]When's the last time you were really worried about Mute's feelings?
[11:31.74]Mute, were you at the stream that I did today?
[11:36.45]I told you I didn't realize you were streaming.
[11:38.39]You need to, like, tweet or something, dude.
[11:40.13]God.
[11:40.87]No, no.
[11:41.91]I gotta... I just wanted to make sure I could do it without crashing or interrupting or... You know what?
[11:48.17]I'm gonna do it right now.
[11:50.56]What?
[11:50.78]I'm gonna tweet that I'm streaming.
[11:53.78]I just, like, felt it.
[11:54.88]Like, I never tweet that I stream, and I missed yours because you don't.
[11:58.14]And I was like, just... Well, I will eventually.
[12:02.62]It just...
[12:04.45]This wasn't a stream.
[12:05.37]I was streaming Diablo 3.
[12:10.21]It was a bandwidth test.
[12:11.45]I was just seeing how it ran here.
[12:13.57]I think all the little boys are really happy that I just tweeted that I'm streaming.
[12:38.43]Good for you.
[12:42.17]Where is my... Interesting.
[12:48.21]Are you in like a full server?
[12:55.30]Servers are like... You're actually going to play?
[12:59.12]Yeah.
[13:00.76]In like start one.
[13:03.40]I just was... Whatever.
[13:11.04]I mean, can you join off me on Steam?
[13:12.88]I forget how it even works.
[13:14.92]Hold on.
[13:18.00]I like that rooftop stage.
[13:19.06]It's a little, like, too white because my character outlines are also white.
[13:26.11]Nice and varied.
[13:34.01]What are you playing right now?
[13:35.35]Oh, I'm playing... What do you mean?
[13:39.65]Are you in like a deathmatch, freeze tag?
[13:41.13]Deathmatch.
[13:45.98]We'll find out.
[13:46.84]I really don't know how to like join.
[13:50.94]Usually there's only like one server anyway.
[13:52.86]What's your name?
[13:54.18]S-J-E.
[13:58.05]There's currently seven people.
[14:01.33]Oh, now there's eight.
[14:02.15]Eight is that.
[14:04.17]Well, why don't you just go find like a new game?
[14:06.83]Just go find Night Genie.
[14:10.00]Once I die.
[14:10.52]Once I die.
[14:11.10]Once I die.
[14:11.66]Once I die.
[14:15.21]You see, I see Deathmatch open room.
[14:16.97]You ready?
[14:17.37]Oh.
[14:17.95]Because I just left that one.
[14:21.81]I think I can host one.
[14:24.95]Yeah, but yeah.
[14:26.03]Let's just, this'll be easier.
[14:28.48]What'll be easier?
[14:29.62]Just join Deathmatch.
[14:31.88]That's not easier.
[14:33.34]This'll be easier.
[14:34.12]Alright, join.
[14:34.74]I'm gonna join.
[14:35.56]What's the game name?
[14:36.48]There shows game names?
[14:40.29]I clicked on join.
[14:41.19]It said game name.
[14:42.37]That's what I mean.
[14:42.97]I have to host the game for there to be a game name.
[14:46.43]Well, then do it.
[14:47.29]Let's go.
[14:47.79]Let's go.
[14:48.18]Let's go.
[14:48.52]Let's go.
[14:49.16]What will the game name be?
[14:51.18]Live from NY.
[14:52.88]No.
[14:53.54]No, that's that.
[14:55.82]Live from NY.
[14:57.22]No.
[14:57.46]Okay.
[14:57.70]I didn't do it.
[14:58.22]You said it sucked.
[14:59.76]You're judging me.
[15:00.66]I'm going to name it Cupcake.
[15:03.44]Let's go.
[15:03.78]That's good.
[15:05.08]Cupcake.
[15:08.01]Full or not found.
[15:09.62]I just hosted it.
[15:10.96]Here we are.
[15:14.33]There we are.
[15:15.05]Oh, Eugene.
[15:23.43]Hey, Eugene.
[15:24.21]That's what your shitty alias was.
[15:25.55]Yeah.
[15:27.43]And we got all the people.
[15:29.43]Cool.
[15:31.41]Ready?
[15:32.71]I'm ready.
[15:32.99]I haven't played in a while, but you know, whatever.
[15:38.31]This is just free-for-all?
[15:39.69]Yeah.
[15:40.52]That's, like, all I play.
[15:44.48]Anything but free-for-all.
[15:46.50]Well, Free Saga's fun.
[15:47.38]Boy, I haven't played this in a long time.
[15:50.76]Free-for-all is where you get the real clickin' going.
[15:54.73]You can, uh, there's a zoom button now that's going on about that room.
[15:57.07]I think it's controlled by default, maybe?
[16:03.09]Anyone who's, uh, using Spectacles has a chance.
[16:11.37]What's like the... How do you like jump higher?
[16:15.04]I don't know what it is by default either.
[16:16.52]Mine is space.
[16:21.98]I can't... Oh, okay.
[16:23.92]I got it.
[16:24.54]I'm a little rusty too.
[16:25.56]You know what I mean?
[16:27.12]I think I have to turn music on.
[16:32.69]Some light ambient.
[16:33.63]You know what I mean?
[16:34.83]Kind of quiet.
[16:38.13]There's some gibbon going on, but...
[16:41.45]You gonna make a, you gonna make a custom map?
[16:52.10]Custom map in this game?
[16:54.50]You can do it?
[16:55.46]They actually have like, the tools?
[16:57.24]Soon.
[16:59.16]You should like, make a wrap.
[17:00.18]Hey, hey, I'm on the stream soon!
[17:07.68]Whoa, say me name!
[17:08.52]Yeah, but you're in the same house.
[17:11.80]We're on the same house.
[17:12.82]You can like run into the other room and like scream and then run back to the other one and it'll be like super scream.
[17:21.63]Leave me alone.
[17:22.47]I mean, just because my door's open doesn't mean you're allowed in.
[17:29.09]Just like let a weirdo stream on the other side of your house and like talk to himself.
[17:37.40]Can't.
[17:38.46]Can't.
[17:39.32]Can't.
[17:47.75]I mean, I'm gonna win, but that's not enough.
[17:56.90]Whoa.
[17:58.54]I don't even know if I should kill the youth, particularly.
[18:02.42]Got any hats?
[18:03.04]No one here has any hats.
[18:06.04]It's like one hat havert.
[18:11.39]Wow, this music is so silent, it doesn't, like...
[18:33.10]When you say you guys I just assume someone's like Jerma I'm still like you married Jerma like hear that joke every day for the last like two months It's pretty good sounds like it sounds like it bothers you a little doesn't it's just the first thing I assume I
[18:58.65]Ooh, that was a good shot.
[19:05.35]Aww.
[19:06.85]Just standing inside the cubicle?
[19:08.99]You ruined my peekaboo job.
[19:15.06]Who gave you a job peekabooing?
[19:18.28]This game did.
[19:19.22]What were your past experience?
[19:23.23]Item unlocked?
[19:24.71]Hold on, it does a CSGO roulette thing?
[19:28.47]What does that say?
[19:30.82]I got space rat armor.
[19:32.18]Is that good?
[19:34.02]I got a graphics tablet.
[19:36.42]Sellout.
[19:39.82]How do you- where's your loadout?
[19:41.74]I think you just pause.
[19:44.25]Customize, yeah.
[19:46.09]Well done.
[19:46.49]Customize.
[19:53.37]Get back.
[19:54.44]Give me my sellout backpack.
[19:55.82]Oh.
[19:58.80]Don't you- where's your hat?
[19:59.66]Don't you have a hat?
[20:01.82]Um, there's a secret waiting.
[20:04.88]Oh, I need to know the secret.
[20:06.22]It's secret enough for you to say it's a secret.
[20:17.05]I mean, for like, when I cared, it was the subscriber thing.
[20:21.27]Now that I don't care, you can seriously, I think, just be in the main menu and type Ster on your keyboard and you get it.
[20:30.46]It might have changed to something that wasn't Ster.
[20:32.44]I don't remember.
[20:33.02]I think it was like... It wasn't Ster.
[20:35.60]It's gotta be like poo.
[20:36.91]There you have it.
[20:40.37]Unstop me.
[20:51.85]Shit.
[20:56.58]Dude, you got some catching up to do, dude.
[21:01.00]How do you already have 10 kills?
[21:02.82]Have you seen 10 people yet?
[21:06.65]No.
[21:13.43]Oh, lucky.
[21:14.45]That's all it was.
[21:31.14]Eh.
[21:32.20]Are you behind?
[21:32.88]That felt so stupid.
[21:35.32]Where the hell are you?
[21:36.04]I was all the way at the other side.
[21:51.29]This sensitivity is way too high.
[21:54.33]I could not figure out.
[22:04.31]9 kills?
[22:20.72]Have you seen 9 people yet?
[22:22.88]Dude, why won't stealth 1v1 me?
[22:23.98]23 kills.
[22:31.99]Are you on performance-enhancing drugs?
[22:34.51]I had, like, six Pop-Tarts before I turned the stream on.
[22:38.73]Like, really?
[22:44.01]I demand a urine sample from you.
[22:46.83]It's just gonna be full of Pop-Tarts.
[22:55.22]My jam.
[22:58.21]If FPS games can be jams.
[23:00.73]So is this what you do?
[23:01.39]You just kind of zone out, take a bunch of drugs, eat a bunch of Pop-Tarts and play this game?
[23:06.15]Amphetamines.
[23:13.68]Oh yeah, I had Ashley's Mountain Dew.
[23:20.20]You needed that so much.
[23:21.17]I like the dances.
[23:26.45]I like the... Wait, does Shibby just said that?
[23:31.87]Because I tweeted out of streaming, Shibby says not Diablo 3, 0 out of 10.
[23:37.26]Why is that?
[23:39.28]Oh, that Diablo 3 grind, though.
[23:42.24]Oh, good old Shibby.
[23:47.26]That Diablo 3 grind, though.
[23:54.84]Oh, I love the purple map.
[23:59.16]Yeah, there's a lot of places to hide.
[24:01.52]You got the filing cabinet, you got the computer coffee mug, you got the bookcase.
[24:07.77]I forgot I have to like start each.
[24:11.83]You got spectators.
[24:13.77]Or you can't.
[24:15.99]We got this many video gamers trying to play.
[24:17.71]I can maybe kick people each time.
[24:21.50]I don't know.
[24:21.96]I don't really care is the problem.
[24:26.77]I just wanna click on guys.
[24:40.92]What?
[24:41.20]I hate you.
[24:43.16]I really don't like that.
[24:44.26]I'm gonna stop trying to like it.
[24:46.46]Like what?
[24:48.76]Zoom in.
[24:52.95]How do you even do it?
[24:54.71]Shift?
[24:55.29]I think it's control.
[24:56.03]Maybe it is shift.
[24:57.23]My shift is... My shift can't be zoom in.
[25:01.93]I just hold down shift all the time.
[25:06.12]My sensitivity has got to go way down if I'm going to use that.
[25:08.76]There's this independent thing where you can change your sensitivity just for the zoom in, but my 10 seconds in the options I couldn't
[25:30.25]That has to be you.
[25:33.53]Oh.
[25:33.73]Little shrivel boy.
[25:44.64]Double kill.
[25:45.60]What?
[25:47.54]Everyone was coming after me.
[25:54.21]Come on.
[25:59.23]Pop-Tarts are stronger.
[26:00.41]I want to get the trick shot.
[26:08.93]I want to say everyone who's actually in here right now, you're all losing to Jerma.
[26:27.48]Step it up a little bit.
[26:28.63]See, people like to make this big joke that I suck at everything, right?
[26:34.43]That's like the, oh, I suck at everything.
[26:38.55]Sometimes I can turn it on and be good at things too, you know?
[26:44.47]Sorry I didn't take drugs before I turned my stream on like you did.
[26:52.05]That must be you.
[26:54.99]What's your beam color?
[26:57.17]eating Pop-Tarts.
[26:57.99]It's not even fucking healthy for you.
[26:59.57]They're not, dude.
[27:00.65]Should've ate Captain Crunch.
[27:02.39]They were the cocaine ones.
[27:06.37]How healthy for you is Captain Crunch?
[27:09.29]Yeah, that's the joke.
[27:10.49]I know.
[27:10.95]But, like, I want to hear in your, like, psycho messed up brain.
[27:14.10]They're, like, great.
[27:18.22]Full of everything you need for a day.
[27:21.56]Actually, most of the
[27:25.05]Off-the-shelf cereals are loaded with vitamins.
[27:28.79]Oh, you don't even need vitamins.
[27:31.07]It's all about cows.
[27:33.23]Cows?
[27:34.81]Calzones.
[27:35.91]Full of cheese.
[27:38.01]All I eat.
[27:43.50]That hitbox on those backpacks fucked up.
[27:47.18]Can't shoot those.
[27:59.09]24%.
[28:11.27]You're not, uh, you weren't at your 32 last game.
[28:16.20]You're kind of slacking now.
[28:17.80]I did slack a bit.
[28:19.54]Roof level.
[28:21.16]You want to get slacked on this level?
[28:22.60]You want to get slacked on?
[28:23.56]Hey, calm down.
[28:30.60]You ready?
[28:30.88]Wait, when's Doom coming out?
[28:33.54]Wasn't that like February or something?
[28:35.84]I like completely forgot that I remotely cared about Doom.
[28:47.43]Do you really care about Doom though?
[28:49.55]Yeah.
[28:51.21]Oh, this is new.
[28:51.79]I haven't seen this in a while.
[28:52.77]I'm lawbreakers.
[28:54.49]This is cool.
[28:55.09]This is like at the beach.
[28:57.28]This is a beach level.
[28:58.20]This is awesome.
[28:59.06]This is a roof level.
[28:59.98]What are you talking about?
[29:00.92]No, this is the beach.
[29:01.68]That's like the sand.
[29:02.22]This is the mirror's edge level.
[29:05.17]Oh, I thought it was a beach.
[29:08.15]See, there's like a chair range.
[29:10.83]All I need is water.
[29:11.61]Water is too advanced.
[29:24.08]Okay, time to step it up.
[29:29.57]I'm having a hard time jumping.
[29:51.99]My rat colors are not optimal for this level.
[29:56.66]What are your colors?
[29:57.66]I have the white outline, I'm so used to like... This is like the only pure white level.
[30:02.15]Surprising I haven't seen someone fall off the edge yet.
[30:16.08]As I think I just saw you try and jump into the... That had to have been you.
[30:19.90]No.
[30:20.10]Nice spawn protection, you fucking noob.
[30:47.22]He's hanging out.
[30:53.10]Yeah, you are.
[31:00.07]That's too bad.
[31:00.93]I do want to like... I forgot we had a Wii.
[31:10.73]I want to just go play Mario Maker.
[31:13.09]That's out, right?
[31:14.01]That came out the other day.
[31:16.55]Is it out?
[31:17.64]Thought so.
[31:19.04]Yeah, it definitely is.
[31:50.76]We played a game about a guy named Victor.
[31:54.72]That was a great game.
[31:57.80]I'm sad it's beaten and we're done.
[32:00.82]Now I have to no-life Diablo 3 and try and get my soul back.
[32:06.34]That's my constant reminder that I'm going to enjoy Overwatch a lot.
[32:10.31]If they can get their hooks in me for Hearthstone and Diablo 3...
[32:18.24]Overwatch is probably gonna at least be pretty decent hopefully hopefully like a year after release I really still am skeptical on the release being um completely addicting feature complete you don't think it would be or you do think I don't think it would I mean kind of same thing with like diablo 3 sucked on launch
[32:48.26]But that's a different story though.
[32:54.08]You got the Kaplan guy.
[32:55.10]Kaplan's the lead designer, man.
[32:58.69]I don't think it's going to have a good rank on launch.
[33:01.51]I don't know.
[33:02.77]I don't think it's going to have the hooks.
[33:04.99]We're talking about Jeff Kaplan.
[33:06.63]Jeffrey K.?
[33:11.30]I mean, if there's a dude that can do it, it's Jeff Cap.
[33:14.98]Yeah, but Jeff is like being mudded out by like 70 other people that are like destroying his vision.
[33:31.13]Every time Chris Metzen like speaks up in a meeting, fucking god damn it.
[33:35.59]I love Jeff, he's awesome.
[33:40.89]You're an intern compared to me.
[33:46.61]What am I going off about?
[33:48.01]I don't know what the fuck you're doing.
[33:50.71]You made a fucking weirdo.
[34:03.70]I knew that was you.
[34:04.56]No, no you didn't.
[34:05.74]You're the shitty, I stand in place guy.
[34:07.80]No, no, no, that was the only time I did that.
[34:09.82]No.
[34:10.04]And I was only doing it to try to get you.
[34:11.56]What about when you were in the cube?
[34:13.42]Oh, what about you when you were standing on that roof and what'd you say?
[34:15.78]I'm just gonna stand in here.
[34:16.84]Yeah, come on.
[34:18.80]That level's gigantic.
[34:20.07]We all stand around sometimes.
[34:22.49]Yeah, but usually it's you is what I'm getting at.
[34:24.43]No, it's not.
[34:24.91]It isn't.
[34:25.27]It isn't.
[34:26.61]You're wrong.
[34:27.37]You're just dead wrong.
[34:29.63]Everything that you've said has been wrong.
[34:33.22]I've said a few right things.
[34:37.28]May God have mercy on your soul.
[34:39.16]Alright.
[34:50.31]Are those famously bad launches?
[34:53.11]I don't know about that.
[34:57.83]Unless you're only... ...taking into account Yahoo 3 and, like, Warcraft.
[35:05.43]I don't know, I give Warcraft a pass here.
[35:08.65]That was like the first game really like ever to have that many people care about it in one time.
[35:15.07]I don't think you could have a good launch for that game.
[35:18.00]nah you're talking about 2004 old technology and a game with that many people that cared think about that that was a long time ago gaming wasn't that big back then on pc especially that genre especially that was World of Warcraft really exploded hearthstone servers on launches was it bad they usually do have like a server problem I don't know I remember the diablo 3 era like oh can't wait to play diablo 3 tonight
[35:48.65]That was so bad.
[35:50.33]No one could.
[35:51.97]Oh.
[35:53.57]Yeah, right.
[35:56.45]That's part of the chatty challenge.
[36:07.86]Starcraft 2 went fine.
[36:10.18]Well, even if it doesn't, you know, day one, all those launch problems, whatever, they'll be fixed on day two or three.
[36:23.96]So you're going to think you're going to try Overwatch on launch?
[36:35.53]How many people are even going to be able to?
[36:39.77]Question.
[36:40.19]The whole beta thing.
[36:45.88]We're talking about the launch of betas.
[36:49.36]I hope they only allow like three people in.
[36:51.84]Or like not even one of them.
[36:54.54]It's like three random dudes.
[37:03.15]Aw, 3D Gamer just got me.
[37:04.31]They're pretty good.
[37:21.97]Oh, what does the groomed patron say?
[37:23.65]Not today.
[37:24.33]What?
[37:56.69]Damn it.
[38:05.97]Oh, come on!
[38:06.74]I have to do better than that.
[38:12.20]Have you killed me yet?
[38:14.52]Many times.
[38:17.28]Like, right there?
[38:17.98]Wow.
[38:18.18]Wow, it got me.
[38:23.12]Many, many times.
[38:25.95]That sucks.
[38:51.50]I don't have much to say.
[38:52.95]People keep asking about, like, oh, how is it being married?
[38:57.55]Living with that one, like, the bathroom smells every time I go into it.
[39:03.00]That's me.
[39:03.60]That's about it.
[39:06.44]Every time.
[39:08.60]It's, like, disgusting to me.
[39:13.07]Every time.
[39:15.53]I don't know if that's, is that possible?
[39:18.17]Every time?
[39:19.05]She's in and out of there, like, like, she has a problem.
[39:25.02]I'm not going to confront her about it.
[39:27.94]Passively agree.
[39:30.96]Oh.
[39:31.06]You're gonna win one?
[39:42.95]No, I'm just chilling.
[39:44.55]You're doing a lot better than that.
[39:45.67]You're doing better than everyone else sucks.
[39:50.69]I mean, that's what you get when you invite people to train.
[39:54.93]These guys know what they're doing.
[39:57.93]Just the fucking bottom barrel.
[40:02.55]I've gotten bragged at least a dozen times by some of the people in here that did very good shots.
[40:10.05]Give them some damn credit.
[40:13.59]Oh, God.
[40:15.21]Oh, gamer God star.
[40:17.02]Heaven forbid somebody in this room might be able to get you.
[40:22.64]We gotta bring them down a ladder, you know?
[40:24.28]A ladder?
[40:25.80]A whole ladder, not like a step.
[40:27.12]Yeah, because you've, like, climbed up, like, seven ladders.
[40:30.95]You're just sitting on the top, just looking down, like, throwing rocks.
[40:35.15]Uh, those are called instagib rails.
[40:36.01]Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.
[40:45.25]I'm going to be the corner creep.
[40:49.64]Corner creep, corner creep.
[40:53.06]You were making fun of me for being that.
[40:55.28]Corner creep, corner creep.
[40:57.40]Someone else is being a top level corner creep.
[41:01.23]I don't want to be the corner creep.
[41:03.67]This is NA server.
[41:15.69]Shrivel who's the freaking stand in place guy?
[41:17.71]Aye aye aye aye.
[41:34.16]Probably my least favorite level.
[41:40.56]I don't know why.
[41:42.26]Wait no, there's another one that's...
[41:45.38]Very not fun.
[41:50.06]It's just not fun for me.
[41:52.40]The red one.
[41:55.12]Each stage has like its own color.
[42:11.45]How is old man Jerma at the top again?
[42:19.31]And I keep spawning and there's always like four people just standing next to me ready to go No, but I end up getting one person lagger we got a lagger I Spent time chasing the frickin lagger
[42:51.47]Oh, wow.
[42:51.93]Nice, like, dagger.
[42:52.55]Where were you?
[42:53.71]I just jumped into the corner.
[42:55.28]I wasn't standing there.
[42:56.18]Oh, you just jumped into the corner.
[42:57.96]Okay.
[43:02.16]Uh, whoa.
[43:03.98]Oh, my game is going to crash.
[43:06.90]Oh, look at him standing still.
[43:08.06]Oh, my game's crashing.
[43:12.16]Yeah, that was a pretty good excuse.
[43:14.77]I'd probably use that, too, if I was, you know, getting somebody in second place climbing up the ladder on him.
[43:21.86]If you win one, I will give you... Like, anything you want.
[43:28.00]Anything I want.
[43:29.25]Anything.
[43:30.89]Well, get some motivation.
[43:32.11]Get some motivation!
[43:56.12]Need to raise the stakes a bit.
[44:00.18]They've been sitting on the Barbie.
[44:09.00]Get its stakes.
[44:16.26]Better get like a 3k.
[44:17.12]Getting close.
[44:21.87]Ah, shit.
[44:25.57]Yeah, I was almost there.
[44:30.47]Almost?
[44:30.95]She's making fun of your Oreo stuffed cookies.
[44:36.08]What?
[44:36.76]We went to your house and you offered us cupcake Oreo cookie things.
[44:41.63]Those things are great.
[44:42.47]Those things suck.
[44:44.31]What?
[44:44.83]Oh, come on.
[44:47.82]First you tell me you don't like Dr. Elker, now you tell me you don't like my cupcake-filled cookies?
[44:53.10]They actually were gross.
[44:53.74]I threw one out and I didn't even, like, take it away.
[44:56.49]That's unbelievable.
[44:57.11]Come on, that's unbelievable.
[44:58.47]Just so you could eat it.
[45:00.33]Yeah, he... Okay, so listen.
[45:01.11]This is how rude this dude is, right?
[45:03.75]So I offer him a cookie.
[45:05.17]I'm like, oh, you gotta try these cookies.
[45:06.21]They have all these great cookies.
[45:07.60]He goes, oh, okay.
[45:09.14]He takes the smallest little, tiniest little shit bite and he throws it in the trash.
[45:17.53]At least, like, pretend like you liked it, and then, like, put it in your pocket and throw it in the garbage later when I'm not looking.
[45:26.21]You threw that in the trash in front of me and made sure I saw you do it, and, like, oh, these are gross.
[45:30.84]I don't like these.
[45:32.68]And then, like, the taste was on my mouth for a little while, and I was like, eh, maybe I'll give it a second chance.
[45:36.40]Like, that's okay.
[45:37.60]It's just sugar.
[45:39.53]And then I took two out.
[45:42.13]I ate half of one and then threw them both out.
[45:45.75]Without even touching the other one.
[45:51.01]Yeah, seeming to get another invite.
[45:54.85]I didn't get invited.
[45:57.76]I was just like, hey, I'm coming over.
[45:58.96]And you're like, oh, okay.
[46:02.12]That kind of is what happened, isn't it?
[46:05.16]Very short notice, too.
[46:07.12]What a great host.
[46:09.80]Yeah, what a good friend.
[46:11.86]Coming through.
[46:26.01]But who's, like, feeding you the kills?
[46:29.89]Who's just jumping in front of you and, like, letting you kill them?
[46:32.99]Hmm, you'd like that if that were true.
[46:34.69]Because the whole server's doing it for me.
[46:51.66]Ah, what?
[47:15.73]Ow.
[47:16.99]Not a moment where I expected to die.
[47:23.92]I really hope someone is feeding you.
[47:26.76]I can feel even better about it.
[47:29.42]No, what happened was I started winning and you went silent and tried as hard as you could to get back to first place.
[47:34.23]Yeah.
[47:36.10]That's what happened.
[47:37.44]That is kind of where things want.
[47:45.71]Oh no, the Jerm is beating me.
[47:50.11]I have enough of a lead again to talk shit.
[47:53.50]I've got some time now.
[48:05.42]That's what I thought.
[48:06.58]Oh, shit.
[48:07.14]Somebody else might beat me.
[48:12.03]I'm just wiping the sweat off my head.
[48:14.35]My brow is just dripping with sweat.
[48:17.93]Got it.
[48:18.75]We pulled through, though.
[48:26.87]Those homemade cookies?
[48:28.13]No.
[48:30.19]They were from a box, but, you know.
[48:38.50]So what determines if you get an item drop or something?
[48:40.74]It's like once an hour.
[48:42.12]I just gave us some because we haven't played in forever.
[48:55.15]Just some good toons.
[48:57.11]Nice and happy.
[49:03.05]If you beat me on this level, I'll give you anything you want twice.
[49:17.55]So let me translate that for you guys.
[49:19.29]This is the I've played like 300 hours on this map response, right?
[49:25.01]I've played 300 hours on like all of them.
[49:29.57]Not really.
[49:30.00]How much time do I have in this game?
[49:33.20]There's something about the green in here that just like really works for me.
[49:45.48]I'm glad it's going well for you.
[50:14.94]Anything you want twice sounds kinda... creepy.
[50:26.53]Now what if somebody else wins?
[50:27.51]Someone else wins?
[50:29.63]Do they get something twice?
[50:30.61]Because other people can actually be good at this game.
[50:36.03]Well... I'm not sure if you're paying attention to the score, but I've been second place every single game.
[50:48.77]So so you're right now you're blind insults Will be your own doing I could not get these scores if I was blind Someone like good is Gonna talk shit gonna talk shit about my boy drama.
[51:09.74]Oh
[51:26.87]Where were you?
[51:27.33]Were you over there?
[51:27.99]No!
[51:31.27]I'm in third place!
[51:46.12]No!
[51:47.74]Flip your desk, move out of the house, because it's ruined.
[51:55.03]Like, I lost a game while living here.
[51:56.69]This place sucks.
[51:57.95]I was about to say something really fucked up.
[52:03.13]Well, it's new.
[52:04.69]Yeah, what else is new?
[52:08.15]Yeah, I'm not saying that.
[52:11.65]There's 1,000 people online right now.
[52:14.94]That's really good for this game, if that's a for real statement.
[52:18.02]I think even when I was streaming it all the time, I just, I don't know.
[52:27.38]I don't even think there was more than like a hundred when I uploaded that first video.
[52:32.81]Did you ever make a rats video?
[52:33.97]You did, right?
[52:35.29]I recorded a bunch of footage and never made it, I think.
[52:38.21]Oh yeah.
[52:38.77]Like all of my other videos.
[52:41.27]What was I gonna talk about?
[52:42.35]I don't know, you need to stop doing that though.
[52:44.51]I had a whole thing like ready.
[52:48.20]Oh, I remember what happened.
[52:49.16]I think I deleted it all by accident.
[52:52.03]by accident.
[52:54.33]Like I went to go actually make... Wait, no, no, no, no, no.
[52:57.30]I still have it.
[52:58.66]Because I rendered it out, and that's why I deleted it.
[53:03.58]Seriously, I didn't make that video?
[53:05.98]Are you sure you didn't?
[53:07.15]I feel like I've seen a video of you playing Rats.
[53:08.95]No, you did.
[53:10.51]Oh, yeah.
[53:11.01]Was that the stream video?
[53:11.99]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[53:12.53]I think so, yeah.
[53:21.44]You guys, I made a video.
[53:25.74]I know there were some doubters.
[53:42.69]Competition's heating up, Jerma.
[53:45.66]I kind of gave up.
[53:47.88]Just floating around, shooting.
[53:57.33]You'd have to be a real psycho to play this game for like four hours straight.
[54:02.16]Nice work!
[54:07.94]A lot of people just showed up over there.
[54:09.40]Th-thanks SemiColonTuesday.
[54:17.38]This guy is like... I have a YouTube?
[54:20.24]What?
[54:23.00]Check it out sometime.
[54:26.13]All sorts of non-videos.
[54:28.00]Knew someone was gonna be behind me.
[54:32.14]Oh, there's someone behind you.
[54:33.18]That's the rule of, like, any DM.
[54:37.01]They get shot in the back.
[55:19.75]39%.
[55:22.25]Get out of here with that.
[55:25.84]Can you like slam your hand in a car door?
[55:29.14]So you get down to like a normal human being aim percentage?
[55:32.36]You had 30.
[55:33.00]30 is pretty good.
[55:34.58]Yeah, but 40 is like superhuman.
[55:39.03]That means almost every other shot you are landing.
[55:44.36]Here, let's play on the rooftop, and I'm going to keep the aim percentile.
[55:49.00]I might not win, but I'm going to try and keep my percentile there.
[55:52.39]Do you think you can do over 60%?
[55:54.01]I don't think so.
[55:57.15]Realistically?
[55:57.85]There was a game where I tried to do this really hard, and I think I got like 51%.
[56:00.65]I feel like the more you try to do that, the less it's going to work, because you're actively trying to do it in your brain, and you're not going to get it.
[56:13.21]Actually, it might have been 60.
[56:14.05]I don't really... At least 50.
[56:18.62]I already, like, lumped the bucket a couple of times.
[56:25.52]Wow.
[56:25.98]This is not a good round to do it.
[56:27.78]I've already missed a lot.
[56:33.04]And I'm definitely gonna lose.
[56:34.36]I'll do it next round.
[56:37.85]I thought it would be easier on this one because it's, like, so big.
[56:44.08]I think the whiteness of the map is gonna screw me up on this one.
[57:21.13]Wish I could just make the outside area gray.
[57:23.55]You know what I mean?
[57:32.36]Yeah.
[57:33.26]Yeah.
[57:51.85]Yeah.
[57:52.43]People are really rooting for you.
[58:04.36]Can't have that.
[58:38.43]I did start this one off saying I was going to lose.
[58:41.75]Didn't I?
[58:42.25]Yeah, it was for the first, like, 15 seconds.
[58:45.92]You had like six kills on me by the time I started.
[58:48.82]And we're even, so I should be, like, upset.
[58:56.64]Frickin' loser.
[58:59.40]And, and someone's feeding you kills, guaranteed.
[59:02.61]That's not happening!
[59:09.45]It's gonna be close.
[59:20.66]I'll take a Ferrari, please.
[59:22.14]Two of them.
[59:22.72]No, no.
[59:23.74]You see, you're fucking like... I'll take two Ferraris.
[59:27.41]I want red ones.
[59:29.51]You're getting a green one.
[59:39.21]Wow, star sucks.
[59:42.82]You made me try and go for like timed shots in the beginning and you fucking, you cheated.
[59:47.14]We're gonna go for it again on this one if we can get the red map.
[59:54.51]Red map is a good aim at people.
[60:02.45]Jerma pulling out the Ferrari card straight away.
[60:06.35]Hey, man, I don't know how many more shots I'm going to get of that, so you got to go big.
[60:32.81]Uh, I fucking... Why am I zooming?
[60:34.71]I can't do that.
[60:35.51]I feel like I should sometimes.
[60:38.85]I'm just wrong.
[60:40.67]I don't care about winning this one.
[60:45.44]I'm going for it.
[60:47.94]Aimer the gamer.
[61:03.31]50% now.
[61:03.65]I, like, don't want to be worse.
[61:06.73]Oh, come on, you losers.
[61:17.46]You loser.
[61:20.54]Oh, shit.
[61:22.56]Dude stopped walking.
[61:23.58]Right behind me.
[61:31.71]Shit.
[61:46.83]Fifty-seven percent, dude.
[61:51.71]Fifty-five?
[61:52.33]How much focus going on in this?
[62:11.46]This game takes a lot of focus.
[62:14.36]Takes a few.
[62:19.85]It takes focus.
[62:21.89]I'm like right at 50 again.
[62:25.39]Shit.
[62:31.97]Right at 50.
[62:50.29]Damn it!
[62:51.82]You just jumped right over there.
[62:52.70]You know what they call that?
[62:58.84]What?
[62:59.62]I'm asking.
[63:14.96]Shoot.
[63:24.26]Dammit.
[63:25.72]Sometimes you just know you shouldn't have one here in this.
[63:30.75]But you have to.
[63:31.39]Got it.
[63:42.12]Got it.
[63:54.32]Or I can't see behind my yeah.
[64:01.79]Yeah, see me in rats insta-gib.
[64:04.01]I'm seeing you there right now.
[64:07.25]Yeah, see?
[64:09.83]How's it going?
[64:12.01]Oh, you have a good breakfast.
[64:12.95]We have a guest.
[64:14.81]Didn't even ask you the breakfast conversation.
[64:16.81]What do you have for breakfast, dude?
[64:19.61]Bacon and eggs.
[64:22.24]bacon eggs and fruit punch it was really good it was really good I made tacos for me and my loving wife for breakfast is it like breakfast burritos or did you actually make taco real like beef tacos or chicken tacos for breakfast
[64:47.60]Um, I didn't, like, eat any breakfast, so I guess that would be my breakfast.
[64:50.44]Hold on a second.
[64:51.28]Reese's for breakfast?
[64:58.76]Oh my god, unhittable.
[65:02.55]Now the accuracy is just like, who gives a shit?
[65:09.41]Ah, I was trying to do a thing.
[65:11.59]I bet I did, like, a 180 sick kill.
[65:13.87]My new band is sick, sick chill.
[65:24.10]I don't like the red levels.
[65:26.24]The red levels, like, fuck with my eyes.
[65:29.49]Saturation down, dude.
[65:31.45]Yeah, I probably should.
[65:37.82]I would recommend to any aspiring Rattist.
[65:48.94]I am, like, doing, like, what you're not supposed to do.
[65:53.40]Like, weird TF2 strafing.
[65:56.62]Not going as fast as I wanna.
[66:08.73]Map saturation, there it is.
[66:10.05]I wish I had something interesting to talk about, but I'm probably the most boring person on Twitch.
[66:19.54]That's like you.
[66:23.44]So both the blinds are here.
[66:27.65]Wait, I'm boring?
[66:29.19]All I had, all that was in my life today was tacos.
[66:34.75]I had to like, our tortillas had gone bad the night prior.
[66:39.44]So I had to run out and get more.
[66:47.75]For that brief moment while I was outside, I was just like... Getting... hot and stuff.
[67:00.71]Great story!
[67:01.61]That's what I'm talking about!
[67:03.17]That was a good story.
[67:04.52]That's not a good story, that was the whole point.
[67:06.82]Chagos, I already got Chagos earlier.
[67:11.54]My tortillas were rotten.
[67:14.52]I gotta get another tortilla.
[67:23.19]So you liked it.
[67:24.43]You'll probably like this story more than anyone else.
[67:28.65]Tribble!
[67:53.25]Hitaro, you're supposed to be on my team.
[67:57.46]Oh, we got teams going on?
[68:02.96]Have you done the freeze tag in this?
[68:05.10]No.
[68:06.55]Alright, if you won't.
[68:10.43]Yeah, let's do it.
[68:11.61]I don't know if that disconnects all of you.
[68:20.46]I don't think it does.
[68:25.30]The name of the game.
[68:26.42]You ready?
[68:29.46]No.
[68:34.67]Okay.
[68:35.53]I am ready.
[68:38.65]We're going to get a slice.
[68:41.85]Slice?
[68:44.15]The name of the game is a slice?
[68:47.20]Slice.
[68:49.80]A slice of what?
[68:52.55]I can tell that.
[68:53.21]I think I already did tell that story.
[68:55.23]On stream?
[68:55.87]I don't think.
[68:56.51]Did I?
[68:56.81]I told Ashley separately.
[68:59.51]That's not.
[68:59.97]It's just a dumb story.
[69:01.23]This would be like the third time, third or fourth time I've heard the slice story.
[69:05.39]How does this work?
[69:08.91]You kill the other enemies.
[69:10.43]There's two team colors.
[69:11.91]Everyone's trying to deathmatch.
[69:14.97]You kill the other team.
[69:15.71]When you shoot them, they freeze.
[69:16.89]And if you stand near one of your teammates, it unfreezes them.
[69:22.23]That's cool Unfreeze me.
[69:28.91]Oh no You see you're not on my team so you're losing No
[69:50.48]Yeah, it was with the horns.
[69:51.26]It's like... Huh?
[69:51.76]It makes, like, sounds.
[69:57.42]In the beginning, your weapons are locked, so it makes, like, a horn.
[70:00.56]I'll let you know.
[70:01.16]It's a slower-paced game, you know, for some of the more tactical rats players.
[70:07.09]I like to use some tactics.
[70:08.99]That's why we got the blockers everywhere.
[70:12.63]I love that sound.
[70:13.53]Mm-hmm.
[70:14.39]Mm-hmm.
[70:15.95]Mm-hmm.
[70:20.19]Just real quickly want to bring up the 75% shot percentage that somebody has in this lobby.
[70:27.39]You've taken like four shots.
[70:30.53]That means you have fired four times if you only have three kills and like one miss.
[70:34.99]Nope.
[70:36.33]That means I've shot a bunch of times and hit a bunch of people.
[70:40.88]We have played as many rounds as you have fired your gun.
[70:48.22]You'd like to believe that, wouldn't you?
[70:57.62]Yeah, we can't really do anything Like set this one out Come on come on come on Dr. Juice Like touched is like doing all the work.
[71:11.35]I'm not even the one doing it There's gonna go be an unfreezer
[71:25.12]3, 2, 1, action.
[71:43.88]Nevermind.
[71:47.06]I had too much faith.
[71:53.05]What?
[71:53.39]No way!
[71:57.34]You f- you fuckin' scumbag.
[72:00.60]Sorry, dude.
[72:08.68]Maybe we should've just played deathmatch.
[72:12.42]I'm only gonna play for a little bit longer.
[72:14.70]Thanks for playing in the first place.
[72:16.24]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[72:24.44]This is kinda one-sided.
[72:29.65]Can I just, like, kick you?
[72:31.09]Like, whoever has, like, the lowest score at the end, I'm just gonna, like, ban.
[72:35.78]Viking Llama, like, you're done for.
[72:37.66]You're 3% accuracy, dude.
[72:40.50]You're, like, fucking banned.
[72:43.56]You can't ban somebody.
[72:45.88]Wow.
[72:46.56]Reward?
[72:47.43]Banned.
[72:49.89]49?
[72:50.27]3% accuracy?
[72:51.47]That's okay.
[72:51.93]You're on our team.
[72:53.87]The great decided.
[72:57.95]You get like a happy trigger finger with the fans.
[73:02.01]What?
[73:02.61]What like a shitty dude kicking his viewers from like the viewer lobby.
[73:07.21]Yeah.
[73:07.68]You're a fucking dingus.
[73:12.10]Like who's a worse person?
[73:15.98]Oh, you.
[73:17.96]I know.
[73:23.02]I'm just like, come on, dude.
[73:24.90]I was fucking, I was warming up.
[73:26.62]Like, I'm... Dude, he might have been eating, like, a sandwich.
[73:29.88]Oh, you're eating a sandwich?
[73:30.68]There's people in Spectator waiting to play.
[73:33.00]Yeah, but he might have been, like, just finishing up a sandwich.
[73:35.19]And, like, he's like, fuck, oh, shit.
[73:36.79]I've done that before.
[73:37.47]A lot of times.
[73:42.07]Yeah, I haven't played in weeks.
[73:43.87]I'm sucking ass and I get banned.
[73:47.80]Fucking ban, dude.
[73:48.86]Drop the hammer.
[73:50.78]I apologize to that guy.
[73:52.36]That was... I'm sorry you weren't doing well at Arise.
[73:59.37]What a Larry David apology that was.
[74:03.68]This is where Mute gets it from, really, though.
[74:05.74]He took the inspiration from...
[74:12.45]Dude, just wait till one day.
[74:14.25]One day... One day, you're gonna be eating a sandwich, and you're gonna be playing a game, and you're gonna be at, like... Oh, no, you're not even gonna be eating a sandwich.
[74:26.96]You're gonna be, like, just playing a game that you haven't played in a while, and you're not gonna be doing so hot, and then you're gonna get banned, and you're gonna flip the fuck out.
[74:36.40]Why did I get banned?
[74:38.50]What the fuck happened?
[74:39.88]Yeah, and guess what?
[74:40.76]Last TF2 stream, I got banned from a server.
[74:47.04]The first time I was testing out the new HUD, I actually got banned from the server.
[74:50.15]It was awesome.
[74:56.21]That guy deserves an apology.
[74:57.55]That's just my opinion.
[74:59.17]I said, like, I'm sorry you weren't doing well at Rats.
[75:05.51]Like maybe the next time I stream rats and do like a viewer lobby, you'll get in and prove me wrong.
[75:11.94]In like a year.
[75:17.36]What happened?
[75:25.99]It banned.
[75:28.38]You banned me?
[75:33.28]I was done anyways.
[75:33.98]I just tripled your team.
[75:35.26]Looks like there's only one guy left.
[75:38.38]I always win.
[75:40.26]I'm not feeling it.
[75:42.59]I want to go back to deathmatch.
[75:44.37]I always win.
[75:45.65]Oh my god.
[75:53.01]A new game name for deathmatch is going to be... I guess there was survival.
[75:56.27]Oh no, survival was the weird.
[75:59.73]Weird, weird.
[76:05.75]game name is cheese this guy says I once got banned for scamming when I didn't even know how to trade that's next level cheese when is the tribes update actually coming up on the public test thingy hey
[76:34.88]It's like technically out right now on public test run.
[76:44.12]That's kind of funny to me that they'd have a public test run for tribes.
[76:49.18]Why?
[76:49.46]I don't know.
[76:50.34]Like here's the first thing that's changed in this game in like two or three years.
[76:54.24]Like we wouldn't want to bother our players with it.
[76:58.40]Like who plays tribes and is not going to try out the patch?
[77:06.50]We need a separate server.
[77:09.62]Well, maybe they just... Because it's been so long, they don't want to, like, break the game.
[77:14.77]I understand why you'd do it.
[77:16.37]I'm just, like, I really don't like test realms in any game.
[77:21.05]Oh, they don't, like, annoy me.
[77:22.09]I don't know why.
[77:25.40]It's, like, not a...
[77:34.05]The guy got in this DM.
[77:35.25]I'm back, asshole.
[77:38.47]I hope he just shits all over you.
[77:40.83]Me too.
[77:42.11]Oh no, he's in Spectator.
[77:43.35]Haha, you can't even fucking play, dude.
[77:46.35]Have fun, like, waiting in line.
[77:53.42]And when you finally get out of Spectator, you're out again.
[77:57.18]You get one game, and then you're out.
[78:03.60]You have to go up to the fucking ticket booth and pay $20.
[78:05.66]For shitty, like, circus tickets.
[78:11.05]I'm fucking outta here.
[78:13.23]What?
[78:13.59]This is like, toxic behavior.
[78:17.05]What?
[78:20.07]Yeah.
[78:20.85]You're like, you're pushing us all away, Star.
[78:24.02]I know.
[78:28.50]Should I do like, the nice thing and kick someone so that he can get out of spectator?
[78:34.13]Like, this guy's pretty close to me in score.
[78:36.39]I think it's time for him to go.
[78:40.55]Like, okay, buddy, we get it.
[78:42.03]Hey, I got my two Ferraris.
[78:43.73]I'm happy.
[78:45.69]Yeah, but they're both going to be green.
[78:49.05]And the double anything you want was only for that one.
[78:55.35]I see what you did there.
[79:00.55]Why is there so mean?
[79:02.63]I wish I could answer that question.
[79:04.20]I told you guys.
[79:11.42]You have to be the best something.
[79:16.59]I don't think you're the best.
[79:19.63]Is that what you're getting at?
[79:22.67]You're telling me you're the best rats player?
[79:25.19]No, I'm saying I'm the best at being an asshole on Twitch.
[79:31.76]Whose stream are you gonna go to where they're like that mean to you for like no reason?
[79:38.12]I'm the best.
[79:38.72]In my fucking fantasy world.
[79:47.88]How many pop-tarts did you have?
[79:49.76]Six.
[79:50.58]Okay.
[79:56.21]Alright, guys.
[79:57.23]Star's a gremlin from Gremlins 2.
[80:00.05]Don't feed him Pop-Tarts.
[80:01.39]Don't feed him.
[80:02.33]Don't feed this motherfucker after, like, 7 o'clock.
[80:04.88]Otherwise, he's gonna be like a gremlin.
[80:06.96]He used to be like a cute, oh, it's Star.
[80:09.78]Don't feed him Pop-Tarts.
[80:10.80]Now he's gremlin boy.
[80:12.24]Oh, oh, and look.
[80:13.74]I get a hat.
[80:14.36]I get rewarded for this shit.
[80:18.29]Nice Viking hat, dude.
[80:19.97]Bet you wish you had one.
[80:21.81]Actually, I want one.
[80:29.39]Jeremiah, please win for God's sake.
[80:31.03]I already did.
[80:31.51]I redeemed us all.
[80:34.73]I redeemed us all.
[80:36.53]I 30-pointed Star, and I did it.
[80:39.88]I did kick Ashley, but I did it.
[80:49.30]I felt really bad, though.
[80:50.32]I'm sorry.
[80:50.76]That reminded me of this story from, like, middle school.
[80:56.79]I ran up behind a dude and just fucking drop kicked him as he was like walking to his bus.
[81:03.03]And like, I didn't mean to actually drop kick him.
[81:06.27]It was just going to be like, I tap in the back, but I was running way too fast.
[81:09.78]Like, oh, hey, I'm behind you.
[81:10.80]Like I tapped you in the back.
[81:12.44]Hi.
[81:12.68]I like ran up on you.
[81:14.80]And I just like fucking kicked him into the ground.
[81:17.26]And I felt so bad.
[81:18.90]And he like, I told him like, sorry.
[81:20.84]And he's like, no, you fucking did that on purpose.
[81:23.20]He's like really pissed about it.
[81:26.22]Well, you did.
[81:27.08]You ran up behind him and tried to dropkick him.
[81:29.11]That seems on purpose to me.
[81:30.75]It's not what I expected to happen.
[81:32.29]It's the same thing with Ashley.
[81:33.51]I kicked her in the head, but I meant to, like, curl my toes enough that I wouldn't, like, even touch her.
[81:38.87]It's just like a fake, like, haha, I'm not kicking you.
[81:42.43]That normal people don't do.
[81:44.63]Yeah, you know, you could just not physically assault people for no reason.
[81:50.05]You know, you could just not do that.
[81:53.60]Fucking, like, she's not gonna live.
[81:55.90]Nah, I didn't mean to.
[81:57.22]I didn't mean to.
[81:57.76]I just was, like, I mean, I didn't, like, intend to do anything.
[82:02.68]I just ran up behind some dude, jumped in the air, Hulk Hogan style, and tried to dropkick him.
[82:08.73]I didn't mean to, though.
[82:10.27]There was no intent there.
[82:11.79]There wasn't.
[82:12.57]That wasn't the intent.
[82:13.63]It's just I couldn't slow myself.
[82:15.05]I was faster than I thought I was.
[82:17.73]And the cause and my effect in my brain, which is usually spot on and perfect...
[82:28.19]To be a genius, you just have to know everything, and I feel like I possess that.
[82:33.92]What was that guy's name?
[82:38.12]Like, Scott Durkin?
[82:39.23]I've, like, based my life around Scott Durkin.
[82:42.69]Something Durkin.
[82:44.25]Scott Durkin?
[82:46.13]The sweet genius guy that, like, he was perfect, and he knows everything.
[82:54.82]Just woke up one day and I realized, like, I was trying to be you.
[82:58.37]I'm sorry, everyone.
[82:59.55]My intention wasn't to, like, drive you all away with my, like, unbearable personality.
[83:05.79]In my mind, I thought I was funny.
[83:09.16]This isn't how I expected it to end up.
[83:12.76]Unbearable.
[83:15.50]Chad, there you go.
[83:17.44]My unbearable personality.
[83:19.56]Can you send me an email?
[83:25.02]Tell me, can I send emails?
[83:26.21]Do you send emails?
[83:27.27]I wasn't paying attention though, it was 48%.
[83:30.37]Games like this, I always feel like I do better when I just space out and don't really... Yeah.
[83:35.43]The more I try, usually like the worse I end up doing.
[83:41.01]That also sounds like unbearable and like don't listen to me, but that's a real thing.
[83:45.41]Jerma agreed with me.
[83:48.56]Huh?
[83:53.04]God, I wish I could just eat another Dr. Oetker's right now.
[83:57.24]I wish I could have one.
[83:58.40]I really wanted one.
[83:59.26]Can we really go for one right now?
[84:07.44]Good old Dr. Oetker's.
[84:09.90]I don't have any medals.
[84:12.53]Oh, so this is a stream.
[84:14.63]Since, like, it's been, like, three days.
[84:15.93]How many of you picked up a Dr. Oetker's frozen pizza?
[84:23.58]And what's your rating?
[84:28.37]I actually really, really want to try one and you are a Jerm of the salesman.
[84:33.53]I'm telling you.
[84:37.39]I don't mess around when I like promote a product.
[84:40.78]I don't mess around.
[84:41.72]I better fucking love it.
[84:49.28]Fuck your iPad.
[84:50.85]Not this Dr. Oakish shit again.
[84:52.87]I was way more into listening to this, like, Star's Ego.
[84:59.15]Fucking bring that back.
[85:10.91]I genuinely loved... ...Oakir before Jerma said anything about it.
[85:14.75]10 out of 10.
[85:15.11]Get the mozzarella one if you get it.
[85:16.53]Yep, he's telling the truth.
[85:21.36]What is that, cheese?
[85:28.06]Like, I don't believe mozzarella is cheese.
[85:30.24]You don't believe it's cheese?
[85:31.74]No, that's not cheese.
[85:33.08]Yeah, right.
[85:44.43]I like to just do circles on this map.
[85:48.24]Sorry, but I don't like Dr. Oaker 4 out of 10 at best.
[85:52.36]Did you do it right?
[85:53.86]Did you do it right?
[85:55.31]You didn't microwave it, did you?
[85:56.65]You're not supposed to microwave it.
[85:57.61]Put it in the oven.
[85:58.49]I hope you did it right.
[86:00.05]Microwaving anything is gross.
[86:02.85]Put it right on the rack, right in the oven, on the rack, 425 for like 12 to 13 minutes.
[86:10.89]Don't microwave that.
[86:12.01]Dude, that doesn't belong in the microwave.
[86:13.31]It even actually says on the box, do not put in microwave.
[86:16.49]It actually says that.
[86:17.21]Does it?
[86:18.51]Yeah.
[86:24.56]You just trust Dr. Oker to not lie to you?
[86:29.92]Yeah.
[86:31.88]Didn't we, like, conclude that he's...
[86:44.50]Can I, like, spawn?
[86:45.32]At the end of the day, it's frozen pizza.
[86:51.99]I will try again without dying.
[86:54.25]Look, I... Out of every pizza I've ever had that came out of a box, or out of a sleeve, or even some restaurants, man.
[87:07.96]Like, even going out and going out to eat and eating at restaurants...
[87:11.51]This is, it's probably one of the better pizzas just like to sit down and just munch on that I've ever had.
[87:23.63]It's super light.
[87:24.63]The crust is like super crispy.
[87:26.79]It's like, you know what I'm talking about?
[87:30.21]When you like bite, it's like, it'd be famous somewhere.
[87:36.54]It's not like... You know like a lot of these pizzas you bite into and it's like... You almost think you're eating it with your gums.
[87:44.82]No.
[87:45.06]This has got a snap to it.
[87:46.84]You know what I mean?
[87:51.87]You will.
[87:52.63]Recommend me a TV show.
[87:56.23]Sell me on something.
[87:59.49]I tried already.
[88:00.05]You didn't listen.
[88:00.57]You didn't like it.
[88:02.62]Silicon Valley.
[88:04.38]That's because I...
[88:06.55]Let's not get into that.
[88:13.13]Who wants pizza to be crunchy?
[88:17.11]Oh my god.
[88:18.59]I'm trying to get you off of this.
[88:21.82]This is two days now, man.
[88:23.20]We're still talking about it.
[88:24.40]They're still in the chat.
[88:25.67]They're asking questions.
[88:26.63]I need to make sure that we're very clear.
[88:28.71]They're asking questions?
[88:31.07]And you're like the senior representative for fucking Dr. Okers?
[88:34.95]Oh, let me help you with that problem.
[88:36.73]What temperature do I set?
[88:38.74]Oh, Jerma said I should do this at a preheat to 400.
[88:42.54]Hey.
[88:45.24]I don't push many product.
[88:53.06]He said Jerma, not chat.
[88:56.56]Chat, you don't know what I have and haven't seen.
[88:58.86]You don't fucking know.
[88:59.70]I mean, you don't know my... I've actually never had... I never had pizza rolls.
[89:03.09]Totino's pizza rolls.
[89:05.79]Have you ever had Totino's... I'm thinking of the Tim and Eric.
[89:08.97]Totino's pizza boy.
[89:10.35]I watched Totino's pizza boy, and within two days, I did buy a Totino's pizza.
[89:16.09]I do remember doing that.
[89:17.23]And there were pizza rolls there, but I did not buy those.
[89:19.45]Because those have got to be gross.
[89:23.92]How did you know?
[89:24.78]Oh, did you tell him your, like, trick to get me to respond to you?
[89:38.81]He sent me a message.
[89:39.89]What did your message say?
[89:41.12]Last night, I wanted to see if Jerome was on.
[89:43.36]You're always appearing offline, so I never... I wanted him to get back to me as soon as he could.
[89:49.12]So I sent the message to him.
[89:50.60]Dr. Ocher sucks.
[89:53.15]As soon as he saw that message, I have four messages back arguing with me.
[90:03.61]Yeah, it was not happening.
[90:04.67]Yeah, like, you didn't do it right.
[90:07.07]Oh, this is just shitty star as usual, like, I only eat four things.
[90:10.69]Like, fucking insulting me.
[90:12.01]I just, like, wanted a message back.
[90:14.43]Yeah, I was clearly insulting you in those responses.
[90:18.97]Very clearly.
[90:20.94]Like, I have fucking bad taste.
[90:23.48]Yeah, yeah.
[90:24.90]Of course you didn't like it.
[90:26.60]I'm sitting around my keyboard just like, you, yeah, fuck you, yeah, oh, yeah, obviously I don't fucking know, you don't even know what's good.
[90:33.57]I was very upset about it.
[90:35.41]Yeah, so I know pretty much exactly when you woke up this morning.
[90:37.71]Yeah, you probably did.
[90:44.97]Oh, now I know how to get Jerma to talk to me.
[90:48.03]You just have to find his one or two things that he's on at the moment.
[90:54.46]You have these really vicious phases.
[90:58.56]They don't last very long.
[91:00.02]No, they don't.
[91:01.20]It's like a couple days.
[91:03.52]You make it sound like I'm in these things for months at a time.
[91:06.08]No, you're not.
[91:06.88]I'm just saying they're very short.
[91:08.54]You need to know on a day-to-day what's the thing.
[91:13.48]Usually it's Captain Crunch.
[91:15.98]I don't think I've ever talked about Captain Crunch except for one time.
[91:19.04]You always talk about serial characters.
[91:22.16]Any day of the week you could get into a conversation about serial characters.
[91:26.42]This is not true.
[91:28.00]Don't make me look like a serial killer.
[91:33.35]Hey, let's talk about cereal today.
[91:35.05]No, this shit doesn't happen.
[91:39.49]It's happened on stream before.
[91:41.63]Yeah, but you make it sound like I do this every day.
[91:43.87]I don't do it every day.
[91:44.93]It was every day for like a week.
[91:48.21]Like around the first Jerma Rumble.
[91:50.38]Well, because I was making characters.
[91:53.68]It just all happened to be cereal characters.
[91:55.86]That's where all your inspiration was coming from.
[91:59.25]It's because Captain Crunch was like the champion.
[92:01.77]The chat was just like, fuck shit, like his trigger.
[92:06.66]Let's get off this topic already.
[92:08.74]It's not positive.
[92:15.79]When's the next Jerma Rumble?
[92:20.71]It will be in theaters.
[92:22.81]What?
[92:24.36]Yeah, right.
[92:25.12]Maybe if I get that distribution deal with Dr. Oakers.
[92:30.36]You could have asked for anything.
[92:35.50]Christmas.
[92:37.84]Shooting for Christmas.
[92:39.30]Time.
[92:40.66]Maybe.
[92:42.36]That could be totally wrong, but let's just say Christmas.
[92:48.08]Oh, when's my next video?
[92:52.24]tomorrow you tell me this guy makes videos you say it doesn't doesn't send emails I really love that one you wanted you you'd wanted me to take that part out not the whole part you wanted me to remove the computer and that whole thing had to be there for that for that to pull off how it pulled off it that had to be there you know um
[93:22.40]Ashley says he only had one cereal in his house, and it was Captain Crunch.
[93:27.35]That's true.
[93:28.85]But very important follow-up rebuttal to that.
[93:33.11]I had only gone to the supermarket one time just to get the essentials.
[93:38.05]You know, just to get the essentials.
[93:39.87]Eggs, bread, milk, Captain Crunch.
[93:43.87]Just the essentials.
[93:44.79]Those were the essentials.
[93:46.43]And then everything else could, you know, fill in at some point later.
[93:48.39]I'll get, like, Froot Loops later, you know.
[94:02.17]People must think.
[94:02.79]People must think we're fucking real weird.
[94:06.21]We are.
[94:06.67]Yeah, I guess we are.
[94:10.06]Pretty weird, dude.
[94:18.10]We have like our normal adult moments because you need to have them to function in society.
[94:22.36]Yes.
[94:22.60]You can like make a wife do things.
[94:24.10]I've been working on.
[94:30.15]Yeah, it's funny.
[94:31.39]Nobody gets to see us have our adult conversations.
[94:34.07]That's the funniest part.
[94:36.37]Us talking about, like, bills and, you know, our plans and, you know, hey, we're going to do some things here.
[94:41.66]Yeah, so, yeah, when you're going to be moving, it's all kinds of things I'm going to tell you about and all kinds of things you're going to tell me about.
[94:49.16]Jeremiah always has grandfather, like, he's like my dad and I'm his son.
[94:53.72]Let me tell you about, like, home loans.
[94:56.62]Here's everything you need to know about, like, a mortgage.
[95:00.70]I'm looking after my son.
[95:03.02]Come on, man.
[95:05.95]You're, like, doing everything you can to make sure I don't end up like your other son, MLC Stealth.
[95:10.15]He just, like, just fucking doesn't listen.
[95:13.45]He just doesn't listen.
[95:18.76]You gotta be the good son.
[95:21.76]Isn't that a movie?
[95:22.88]The Good Son?
[95:25.04]No, yeah, with Elijah Wood and Macaulay Culkin.
[95:28.48]And Macaulay Culkin's, like, a murderer.
[95:31.23]No, I swear.
[95:31.77]I swear to God.
[95:33.31]There is a movie where Macaulay Culkin is like a bad criminal little kid.
[95:38.92]And it's like Elijah Wood versus Macaulay Culkin.
[95:42.24]When they were like 11.
[95:42.84]The movie's called The Good Son.
[95:45.90]Did I ever tell you about me old, Owen?
[95:49.52]No.
[95:49.72]I don't think you have, Dad.
[95:55.66]Stephen King.
[95:56.18]Stephen King!
[95:56.76]Can we talk about Stephen King for a minute?
[95:59.00]Alright.
[96:01.32]What a treasure.
[96:05.58]Think about all the fucking wonderful things Stephen King has given us.
[96:10.52]In, like, the arts and entertainment.
[96:13.57]I can name, like, one.
[96:18.01]Can you really only name one?
[96:19.27]No, I'm just joking.
[96:20.27]I couldn't really follow it up with anything.
[96:23.61]Like, how can somebody make so many good things over his lifetime?
[96:27.88]You know who's, like...
[96:30.80]The Nolan Brothers as well.
[96:34.30]The Nolan Brothers?
[96:35.44]Yeah.
[96:36.22]Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan?
[96:39.12]Oh yeah, I was gonna say.
[96:40.18]They've been putting out some fire.
[96:49.27]Resistant fire.
[96:50.61]Like it will roast you.
[96:52.62]So this guy Whomp is saying, like, yeah, he does a lot of, like, cheesy, corny, like, horror stuff.
[96:58.29]But think about the other shit that he's responsible for.
[97:00.75]Like, Shawshank Redemption.
[97:02.91]The Shining.
[97:05.68]Like, these are all... Stephen King has, like, done so many crazy things.
[97:12.42]That are, like, holy shit, that's like a treasure.
[97:14.38]Oh, he did It, right?
[97:19.38]Yeah, oh yeah, yep.
[97:21.00]He has done a lot of very, very good... Running Man... Like, everything.
[97:28.33]What made you bring up Stephen King, though?
[97:31.69]That was such a, like, huge jump from Dr. Oakers.
[97:35.37]Um... I don't know.
[97:40.60]But yeah, if you ever have, like, a moment, just go look up the...
[97:47.43]The amount of things that Stephen King is responsible for.
[97:52.57]You'll be like, holy shit, this guy is responsible for a ton of things I love.
[98:00.75]Yeah, the novella was Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.
[98:06.87]Adult conversations.
[98:07.97]We're doing it.
[98:09.25]This is kind of an adult conversation.
[98:10.33]We're doing it.
[98:13.37]Stephen King smells like Dookie.
[98:16.21]Stephen King of pizzas.
[98:19.19]Dr. Oetker.
[98:32.22]He didn't invent baking powder, so I don't know.
[98:36.02]I mean... Yep, Green Mile.
[98:40.89]That's also Stephen King.
[98:44.10]I'm gonna look it up.
[98:44.82]I'm gonna look up just, like, all, like, the wonderful things Stephen King has done.
[98:49.20]And then people were pissed off that he just won, like, an extremely high literary award.
[98:54.54]And there were a bunch of... Yeah, there were people that were just like, he's like a cheesy horror shitbag.
[99:01.61]It's like, really, man?
[99:03.75]He's contributed so much to, like, the arts and entertainment.
[99:07.89]He is THE horror shitbag.
[99:09.44]No, but he's not though, like, he, like, he, he, sure he makes a lot of, like, horror, but there's so much other stuff that he's done that's just awesome, and not really in, like, the horror genre.
[99:21.85]I don't read books over here.
[99:26.67]All I have to go on is that the movie's based on his novels.
[99:29.03]The Stand?
[99:29.93]He, he, The Stand.
[99:31.99]I don't recall that one.
[99:36.97]The Shining, The Stand...
[99:41.48]I actually heard Dark Tower is really good.
[99:43.76]Actually, yeah, I did read the first book of the Dark Tower.
[99:47.05]Talk about, like, not reading things, I did read that.
[99:49.77]Pretty good.
[99:50.13]Did Stephen King single-handedly create Mania?
[99:55.29]He, like, carved it.
[99:58.09]I think so.
[100:00.43]Green Mile.
[100:02.09]You said that.
[100:03.04]You said that!
[100:04.92]Was Dreamcatcher any good?
[100:05.96]I don't know if the movie was any good.
[100:10.42]Dreamcatcher.
[100:13.96]Catching Fire, the Hunger Games.
[100:20.32]Maximum Overdrive is such a crazy movie.
[100:22.40]Okay, so you're like reading his wiki?
[100:24.58]Yes.
[100:25.38]And... I am at the moment.
[100:26.48]What if... What if... It attributes him to the recipe behind Captain Crunch?
[100:34.49]I don't even know.
[100:35.39]I don't even know what I would do.
[100:39.09]I wish... I wish that were true, just to see what you would do.
[100:44.14]What a great guy.
[100:45.82]He came up for the recipe of Captain Crunch.
[100:48.94]Is that what you're saying?
[100:51.42]Captain Crunch is his design.
[100:59.68]I don't know.
[101:01.92]I'd put a tattoo of his face.
[101:03.29]You would tear down that Benjamin Franklin poster you're going to get and put up by Stephen King.
[101:08.05]Oh, yeah.
[101:09.89]I would get a tattoo of Stephen King's face on my face.
[101:15.82]Half the lead.
[101:18.16]Like a 50% there.
[101:19.62]You can go either way.
[101:25.82]Half of his face?
[101:26.58]Dude, Rawal's is still spectating and hasn't gotten to play yet.
[101:37.55]Get fucked.
[101:40.40]I think you actually have to leave Spectator and come back and review him, which... Steaten King.
[101:56.41]What is he doing now?
[101:57.11]Is he getting anything new coming out?
[102:01.61]I thought they were gonna make Dark Tower a series.
[102:04.75]I think that's a movie.
[102:05.47]I don't know.
[102:08.24]I heard at some point it was being worked on, I don't know if it was- Dude!
[102:10.93]Fuck, in 2015 there was supposed to be a Dune movie, where is it?
[102:13.99]Look that shit up.
[102:15.61]I don't know.
[102:17.73]I think I actually brought up that I was excited for the Dune movie on this stream like two years ago.
[102:26.80]Misery- I forgot about Misery.
[102:29.90]Misery is awesome, it's crazy.
[102:34.08]He did misery to God.
[102:36.16]What?
[102:37.10]Just a box full of gold coins of a man.
[102:51.88]Kathy Bates was in that movie.
[102:54.29]I think she won the Academy Award.
[102:56.21]She won the Academy Award for that, yeah?
[102:57.85]He also did do rights in the studio.
[102:59.73]That's true.
[103:20.14]Yeah, transferred to film extremely well.
[103:22.30]I would attribute that to Kathy Bates.
[103:26.56]She just became that character.
[103:28.38]It was crazy.
[103:32.83]Misery?
[103:34.00]Yeah.
[103:34.48]Have you ever seen Misery?
[103:35.20]I have not.
[103:38.55]Oh, you've got to be... No, if you have no idea what it's about and what it is... Yeah, I actually don't.
[103:43.79]Yeah, just watch it.
[103:45.37]It's going to be a treat for you.
[103:47.47]It is so twisted.
[103:49.59]A streamer is talking about Stephen King.
[103:53.01]That is kind of... That is kind of out there.
[103:56.53]You always come up with the weirdest topics.
[104:00.40]Stuff leads into other stuff and you just roll.
[104:04.10]Which I regrettably bring up again.
[104:07.54]What'd you say?
[104:07.90]There was a string of words there.
[104:11.81]Don't worry about it.
[104:13.59]Doctor?
[104:14.29]It was a doctor?
[104:14.85]You went to the doctor?
[104:18.25]Was there an O in there?
[104:19.11]No.
[104:22.79]You sure?
[104:23.57]Yeah.
[104:24.51]I could talk about it again, you sure?
[104:26.97]I could talk about it.
[104:32.64]Yeah, Misery's fucking awesome.
[104:34.16]You have to watch that movie.
[104:39.46]You know the one scene you wanted me to watch from White Hart American Summer?
[104:43.74]There's one scene that I want you just to watch from Misery.
[104:47.88]It is horrible.
[104:51.88]Oh, sounds great.
[105:00.11]Is there any violence in it?
[105:01.89]I don't like violence.
[105:04.23]Yes.
[105:06.43]Yes, there is.
[105:07.21]Is it as good as Saw?
[105:10.17]Saw was so good.
[105:12.95]I went to the theater with Becky.
[105:16.53]Oh, don't do this voice.
[105:17.97]Okay, moving on.
[105:21.07]I went to the theater with Becky.
[105:22.59]What the hell was that?
[105:23.95]That was my I love Saw voice.
[105:27.85]Saw is the best movie.
[105:29.09]I especially like the fourth one.
[105:30.45]I think it really tied it together.
[105:32.13]I'm in the theater with Becky.
[105:57.54]New song.
[105:59.70]You ever just, like, just hang out?
[106:02.44]You're just hanging out.
[106:03.28]Yeah.
[106:05.38]And you're not really doing anything.
[106:07.27]Like, right now?
[106:09.01]Like, yeah, let's just say right now.
[106:11.25]And somehow, you don't know how.
[106:14.79]There's no explanation for it.
[106:16.49]And both of your hands are just down your pants.
[106:20.35]Both of them.
[106:21.37]All the time!
[106:23.17]Right?
[106:24.91]You know, I heard when a baby comes out of the baby spot...
[106:28.90]They just, like, they just grab it right away.
[106:31.66]It's the first thing they just, it's just, that's where your hands go to.
[106:38.17]I am just like, sometimes I'm just like, how did that happen?
[106:42.86]My hands are just, my hands, both of them are just stuffed down here.
[106:45.70]How did they even get here?
[106:46.52]I mean, especially now, it's a struggle because I live with Ashley and like, I don't want her to come in here with my hands just down my pants and be like, whoa, what are you doing?
[106:53.34]No, you don't understand.
[106:54.80]That's just where they go.
[106:56.54]It's warm and they go there.
[106:59.85]But it's summertime.
[107:00.89]It's hot out.
[107:01.37]I shouldn't be doing that.
[107:02.99]You know what I mean?
[107:03.99]I should be like getting cool.
[107:06.38]It's pretty cool now.
[107:07.20]It cooled down a bit.
[107:09.62]No, it has nothing to do with like, you know, any private area or anything.
[107:15.09]They're just in there.
[107:16.23]Just hanging out.
[107:17.19]Just for no reason.
[107:18.57]I would guesstimate like 60% of the stream watching, like hands were in your hands.
[107:24.45]And all of them just took them out real fast.
[107:26.45]I was just like, oh, Jesus.
[107:28.10]Yeah, because when you realize it, you just stop.
[107:31.60]And then there's a couple of, you know, the handful of just like, I don't fucking care.
[107:36.51]Just staying.
[107:37.13]Okay, I prefer the Stephen King.
[107:44.41]Personally.
[107:54.59]Timber, you're almost dirty.
[107:55.54]Control yourself.
[107:56.40]Not yet.
[107:58.10]How good do you think I'd be at rats if my hands weren't...
[108:01.72]I thought you were going to say 30.
[108:04.16]What?
[108:04.34]I thought you were going to be like, how good at Rats would I be if I was 30?
[108:06.80]You're going to have some experience in that.
[108:11.55]Am I just going to instantly be like your level?
[108:14.67]We could finally start playing more games together like Rampage Knights?
[108:18.89]I've definitely absolutely slowed down a bit.
[108:23.47]In like the reflex department, I can tell.
[108:29.73]But whatever.
[108:30.21]Happens, man.
[108:36.86]I just have a general... If I'm not doing something, my hands need to be touching.
[108:42.00]I usually have something around my desk.
[108:46.01]I'm just fucking with this.
[108:48.21]If I get my hands on a paperclip, I'll like... Paperclip diddle.
[108:54.43]Until I lose it.
[108:56.47]I have to have something.
[108:57.85]I'm like that when I'm walking anywhere.
[108:59.65]If I'm walking around, I have to have something in one of my hands.
[109:04.09]It just feels odd walking around with nothing in your hands.
[109:07.62]I feel like I'm pretending to be a person.
[109:11.92]If that makes any sense.
[109:13.70]I'm walking with my hands down.
[109:16.22]I'm pretending to be a person.
[109:19.61]When you have something in your hand, it's just like, yeah, I've got something in my hand, you know?
[109:24.70]I'm not like a toy soldier.
[109:29.05]What?
[109:29.29]That'd be like weird.
[109:31.25]Implying that I'm like walking around with my hands going up and down.
[109:33.77]I thought you meant like walking around like holding and staring at like a little toy soldier.
[109:42.78]No.
[109:42.86]It's like a creep.
[109:57.40]Like my keys.
[109:57.96]I always just have my keys in my hands.
[110:02.20]Or a coffee or something.
[110:03.70]It's always like a cup I'm just kind of holding onto or like a drink or something.
[110:06.73]I'm a big key in hand man.
[110:12.15]I do put my hands in my pockets, yeah.
[110:15.25]I'm just saying, like, I can never have both my hands out just hanging there and walking.
[110:21.84]I don't, it just, I don't like it.
[110:23.96]I always have to be doing something with my hand.
[110:25.98]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, we get it.
[110:30.43]Yeah, yeah.
[110:33.89]What kind of jacked up bootleg brain signals do you have?
[110:41.86]That's a, uh... That's a pretty, like, awesome way to put that.
[110:48.77]Bootleg brain signals.
[110:50.77]As if I'm buying, like, a DVD on, like, those New York City streets.
[110:53.78]Yeah, it's the off-brand Buffalo Bill.
[110:58.72]Buckaroo Jones.
[111:13.51]literally anything to eat that's like hot and cooked you don't have you guys have you guys not gone food shopping no I know lag I know how to walk like a human I'm just saying I'm making an alliteration that when you're done I don't have something in my hands I it's it was a it was a alliteration
[111:42.82]Yeah, aren't you supposed to be in a hospital right now?
[111:45.62]Huh?
[111:48.76]After electroshock therapy?
[111:59.32]Alliteration is not what that means.
[112:05.66]What's that word?
[112:08.95]What's that word that means that I'm trying to say?
[112:10.93]What are you trying to say?
[112:12.71]Like, I'm given a... It's like an over-exaggerated example.
[112:20.33]Isn't alliteration what the word sounds like?
[112:22.59]That's not alliteration.
[112:26.38]I don't think there is a word for what you're talking about.
[112:28.42]No, there is.
[112:29.38]Embellishing?
[112:32.50]No, no.
[112:33.34]Not onomatopoeia.
[112:35.10]That's onomatopoeia.
[112:39.46]Like an extreme comparison.
[112:43.16]We're saying hyperbole.
[112:45.52]Hyperbole.
[112:46.44]Hyperbole.
[112:48.14]Oh, boy.
[112:48.76]Hyperbole.
[112:51.33]Why can I not say it?
[112:55.53]Hyperbole.
[112:58.39]Wow.
[113:00.43]Yeah, hyperbole.
[113:01.13]I think the Patriots are making the hyperbole this year.
[113:10.24]It's like future football.
[113:13.20]Dude, from Starship Troopers.
[113:17.06]I'm a hyperbully.
[113:21.52]Hyperbully.
[113:25.87]Oh, boy.
[113:29.25]Look at these bootleg brain signals.
[113:32.07]I am tired.
[113:32.91]I get like this when I'm tired.
[113:39.69]How much rats have I fucking played?
[113:42.64]How long has this stream been up?
[113:44.42]Hyper bully.
[113:49.02]What's your favorite insult?
[113:50.74]Definitely fuck you.
[113:51.78]Without a doubt.
[113:52.24]Hey, fuck you.
[113:58.20]It's so easy.
[113:58.98]It's so quick.
[113:59.54]And it gets your entire point across.
[114:03.48]You don't need to add anything to it.
[114:04.74]You don't need to be vulgar about it.
[114:07.76]Just fuck you.
[114:08.50]That's it.
[114:11.01]A double middle finger.
[114:12.13]Oh yeah, almost two.
[114:34.01]a huge mistake yesterday.
[114:35.35]I got the feel for it.
[114:37.23]I was like, dude, this is probably a four hour stream and it was only three hours and I'm sorry.
[114:40.57]I lied to everyone.
[114:42.08]I tricked them.
[114:42.68]I said like, wow, what a good four hour stream.
[114:44.72]And like some people probably believed.
[114:45.94]I'm a reptilian.
[115:00.52]What kind of reptile can I be?
[115:02.66]Do I get to choose?
[115:06.60]A kimono dragon.
[115:08.94]Or a monitor lizard.
[115:11.20]Yeah, definitely a monitor lizard.
[115:12.16]What was the name of that big lizard we looked at in the video because we had no lives?
[115:15.91]Monitor lizard.
[115:17.93]That's what I would want to be.
[115:20.81]His actual name is like Big Boy.
[115:22.93]Blue.
[115:23.33]Blue was his name.
[115:25.93]I believe.
[115:27.43]It was Big Boy and Blue.
[115:28.69]Look that shit up on YouTube.
[115:31.68]Guy's got a big lizard.
[115:33.46]So interesting.
[115:35.57]Actually, it is kind of real.
[115:36.55]It's kind of real.
[115:38.35]Yeah, it's kind of real.
[115:39.03]It's kind of cool.
[115:41.13]This dude has a monitor lizard that just lies on his stomach and he likes petting him like a dog.
[115:46.77]Oh, yeah, there's a big boy.
[115:51.71]And then he, like, eats it.
[115:53.67]Yeah, he kind of is like, yep, there's a big boy right here.
[115:56.61]Hey, what do you say you take a look at that camera?
[115:58.93]He gives him a couple of, like, good slaps.
[116:01.18]I don't know why.
[116:01.88]I really enjoyed that video.
[116:03.96]Yeah, and when he feeds him too, he's like, you want some of this chicken?
[116:06.83]Eat some of that chicken, big boy.
[116:08.25]Oh yeah, we did determine he was a BF.
[116:10.25]Yeah, absolutely.
[116:12.17]Absolutely.
[116:14.71]So, like, my respect level for this guy went up, like, 50 points when we figured that out.
[116:23.20]There's another example of, like, adult conversation.
[116:34.61]That one time we talked about lizards.
[116:37.39]Oh no, that was the day you found out that frogs are assholes.
[116:40.29]Oh yeah.
[116:42.31]Yeah, I did, yeah.
[116:43.05]There was a bunch of frogs in chat.
[116:45.03]You ever found out that frogs eat other frogs and like, I don't know how you feel about them anymore.
[116:52.22]You're a big frog.
[116:53.68]A friend of frogs.
[116:54.82]Now you're like, I don't know.
[116:56.22]No, that was a scary video.
[116:58.26]There was creepy music on it too, for some reason.
[117:00.74]Yes, talking about Biaz is very adult.
[117:07.75]Can I ban that kid?
[117:20.79]What?
[117:21.05]Being an adult is boring.
[117:23.00]You know like what adult stuff I'm doing?
[117:24.74]Like what I did today?
[117:26.90]I wrote up a few checks.
[117:29.72]And I put them into the mail.
[117:30.68]That sounds awful.
[117:36.83]I'll just write out some checks.
[117:40.05]Oh, this pen.
[117:41.31]This pen seems to be out of ink.
[117:45.31]I'm gonna have to pick up some more pens.
[117:52.90]It is that depressing, isn't it?
[118:11.97]Sometimes I don't get what I want.
[118:15.03]Oh, it's horrible.
[118:16.84]I know.
[118:17.14]Is it this video?
[118:33.85]Is this supposed to be the frog eating the other frog and I don't like it and I don't want to click it?
[118:41.74]I made a tweet about this but like more like adult life things It was in my kitchen I'm just sitting there looking at my counter
[119:07.80]I'm like, oh, you know what would look really great here?
[119:10.41]It's, uh, granite.
[119:14.77]And then I, like, stopped and I was like, what the fuck am I talking about?
[119:17.99]What?
[119:19.27]I mean, it would, but who cares?
[119:22.59]I know, I know.
[119:23.31]When I was moving in, I said that, like, yesterday.
[119:26.17]That, like, I got into the whole home improvement thing for, like, three days because we were moving in, we were setting up everything the way we wanted.
[119:31.69]I, like, drilled a hole in my desk to, like, get my mouse cord to go, like, exactly where I want.
[119:36.38]I tried to, like, get everything right.
[119:38.68]And I just stopped fucking caring.
[119:41.54]There was so much stuff, like, that I was gonna do or was planned or that I had a stake in that I'm just, like...
[119:48.05]I have my computer set up.
[119:49.15]I don't fucking care anymore.
[119:52.67]I like leave my room a few times a day and walk around and go, oh, this wall's kind of bare.
[119:57.52]I don't give a shit.
[119:59.18]I ain't looking at it all day.
[120:00.28]I don't have guests over.
[120:01.84]You're never going to come visit.
[120:04.02]Never.
[120:04.50]Or like not friends.
[120:06.86]I will never come over one time.
[120:12.50]I've already seen my neighbor naked.
[120:15.32]Completely butt naked.
[120:17.18]Wait, what?
[120:18.70]Did I tell you that?
[120:20.60]No, you did not tell me this.
[120:23.45]Is this a stream story?
[120:24.95]This was, like, day two.
[120:26.01]I already saw my neighbor.
[120:27.51]I think I mentioned it on stream.
[120:29.25]I just, like, was getting a box from outside, like, really early in the morning, taking out garbage or something.
[120:33.57]I came back in.
[120:34.19]Their door was slightly ajar.
[120:36.11]And a dude walks by, like, full, like, no clothes, like, walks by the door.
[120:42.14]We're getting really...
[120:44.43]Some good neighbors.
[120:45.77]Very intimate with them.
[120:46.61]Jesus.
[120:51.46]Not totally.
[120:51.94]What are you doing, dog?
[120:53.26]I don't think you mentioned that.
[120:54.16]I thought I did.
[120:55.08]I don't know.
[120:55.54]He doesn't even watch my streams, though, so I'm not judging him.
[120:59.27]You was in my chat today.
[121:00.65]It wasn't like in the stream.
[121:04.91]Must have been... I don't know where he was.
[121:07.96]There was a little... He wasn't talking, you mean?
[121:10.62]No, he just wasn't there.
[121:13.62]He said he doesn't like your stream.
[121:17.34]Did he say that to you?
[121:19.94]Yeah.
[121:21.14]Oh, yeah?
[121:22.54]Well, let's see.
[121:23.06]We'll get it right from the... We'll get it right from the horse's dick.
[121:27.39]Let's see what he says.
[121:29.25]Ew.
[121:34.25]Gotta put a dude on the spot.
[121:35.47]Right from the horse's mouth.
[121:36.93]Whatever that is, isn't that the saying?
[121:37.98]Holy lag.
[121:40.68]Yeah, I hate your stream, Jeremy.
[121:44.28]Almost as much as I hate Starz.
[121:48.74]Ladies and gentlemen, the mod of our channels.
[121:53.46]Hates us both.
[121:55.32]He doesn't even, like, get on.
[121:59.40]How did he become Mr. Mod, by the way?
[122:03.52]I don't remember.
[122:05.20]Why did you do this?
[122:07.75]What happened?
[122:08.90]We've gone over this before.
[122:10.72]Did he just accidentally become a mod and you just let it be?
[122:13.37]Yeah, kinda.
[122:15.85]I remember this, like, his origin story of becoming a superhero.
[122:18.85]Like, I don't remember him becoming a mod.
[122:21.03]You okay?
[122:24.24]What?
[122:25.06]Oh, your dog, I think, just ran into you on mic stand or something.
[122:28.08]Oh, no, he was, like, shagging around.
[122:29.88]He just woke up.
[122:31.60]The story, the origin story of his powers is I think there was one nuclear front stream or something.
[122:36.96]At the end of it, I just fucking banned everybody.
[122:39.92]I just went down the list, message removed, like just crushed everybody for no reason.
[122:43.92]And he like saw that and was like, I guess it's okay.
[122:48.98]And that's like when he got most of his powers.
[122:52.02]Alright, we'll mute.
[122:57.44]Sorry, but this is a public firing.
[123:03.69]You're fired.
[123:05.09]Yeah, but he's fired from my, from Jerma industry.
[123:09.09]Oh.
[123:10.31]That was way before Nuclear Throne came out.
[123:11.67]I thought it was the Jerma industry.
[123:13.47]But it's going to be one of those situations where I... I fired you, but I don't ever take away your position.
[123:21.95]You just don't, like... You can still, like, come into work and everything, but, like, you're not official.
[123:26.96]Your position's not official anymore.
[123:30.19]Yeah, like, if anyone asks, like, no.
[123:32.73]No affiliation.
[123:34.13]Yeah.
[123:34.87]Like, you'll still have mod, but I have no affiliation with that, man.
[123:45.11]Take your shares with you.
[123:46.79]Yeah, take your shares with you, because the company's fucking tanking.
[123:56.43]Yeah.
[123:57.23]Yeah.
[123:58.53]Any wonder it's like your company.
[124:00.05]I think Viking Llama, 4 kills, gave me some solid advice.
[124:13.96]Pat down.
[124:15.30]What is that?
[124:18.52]More aware of my surroundings.
[124:20.04]I don't know what that means.
[124:26.61]I'm about to get bad, dude.
[124:30.61]Plausible deniability?
[124:32.64]You know what you kind of sold me on?
[124:44.93]Pretty much everything I've ever bought.
[124:46.77]But it kind of did make me want to play the Swindle.
[124:51.67]And I told you I hated it, and I actually got a Steam refund.
[124:55.93]I can't believe you did that.
[124:57.19]That game is fun.
[124:58.51]It's just really, really hard and takes a lot of patience.
[125:01.29]I don't have any patience.
[125:02.99]I know, but, like, you see how much patience... You have way more patience than I do.
[125:07.41]No.
[125:07.85]And stuff like that.
[125:08.61]No way.
[125:10.33]You Steam refunded that game.
[125:12.45]That game is fun.
[125:13.37]I think it's because, like, I... That seems... That's a game that...
[125:24.93]I would think would actually probably be pretty fun to speedrun.
[125:30.25]I know, that's what I was thinking too.
[125:31.47]It looked like you could get around fast and it would be fun to go really quick.
[125:35.89]It has everything that you want in those speedrun type games.
[125:38.85]It's procedurally generated.
[125:40.47]You can't really go that fast though.
[125:44.73]Yes you can.
[125:46.44]Not in the later stages.
[125:48.24]You really have to wait for a lot of shit.
[125:50.54]You don't have to.
[125:51.94]Who said you had to?
[125:52.74]You can still get money.
[125:53.70]You can still collect money if you get caught.
[125:55.62]That doesn't mean you lost.
[125:56.78]You just can't get hit.
[126:00.55]There's no losing in that game.
[126:03.99]You need to try to make as much money as you possibly can in 100 days.
[126:09.67]Or less than 100 days.
[126:10.65]100 days sounds like a lot of time.
[126:13.15]No, no, but I'm saying you have 100 days to beat the game.
[126:17.73]You can beat the game in like 5 days if you would, or like 20 days or something if you're really that good at it.
[126:24.61]You can't really though, it seems like way too... Don't go in that room.
[126:32.57]You're not allowed there.
[126:33.22]I'm talking about the swindle.
[126:37.14]That's like...
[126:38.89]I would probably play that game.
[126:40.95]I'm off stream probably for that game for me.
[126:44.27]Because it gives me time to just like kind of chill and... Because I'm really bad at like talking and responding to chat and playing a game that takes that much brain power.
[126:53.08]Hey, do what I do and just don't talk to your chat ever.
[126:56.36]It's compulsive.
[126:57.68]I like have to.
[126:59.20]I like always am looking over like, oh, what do you say?
[127:00.98]Oh, yeah, yeah, let me talk to you about that.
[127:02.42]I just walked into spikes.
[127:05.41]Yeah, as soon as I joined your stream when you were playing it the first time, you died like four in a row.
[127:09.58]And looked really, really stupid.
[127:11.22]I got better.
[127:12.56]It ticked me.
[127:13.38]Because remember, I hadn't played the game since my last stream.
[127:16.72]Which was like three weeks ago.
[127:22.77]Not this morning.
[127:24.57]First time you streamed.
[127:26.45]Oh, yeah.
[127:26.79]Well, I didn't even know what the hell I was doing.
[127:31.78]Maybe I'll play it.
[127:32.92]If you stream it again, I'll watch, and that'll be my deciding factor.
[127:35.75]Did Jerma make me re-buy the game?
[127:38.25]Go get it right now.
[127:43.59]You open up your Steam and just press the button.
[127:47.29]Buy it and download it and then play it on stream.
[127:50.99]The game is probably less than, I would say, probably 200 or 300 megabytes.
[127:54.60]I know, but I just don't feel like streaming it right now.
[127:58.40]I didn't say you had to stream it.
[128:00.84]Just buy it and just buy it again.
[128:03.18]Don't even play it.
[128:03.90]Just buy it again.
[128:04.84]So, hold on.
[128:05.66]You opened it up.
[128:06.54]You didn't like it?
[128:07.88]What was it?
[128:08.42]What did you not like about it?
[128:09.42]It was way more floaty and I thought it was good.
[128:14.69]I mean, the controls are a little... What is it?
[128:19.51]What do you want?
[128:20.91]If that game had, like, Super House of Dead Ninja movement, I'd probably already have, like, 100 hours in it.
[128:28.20]I think there are actually upgrades you can get to break down doors with your arms.
[128:34.02]You just smash into them.
[128:35.48]There's a lot of upgrades in the game, but I didn't get a lot of them.
[128:38.92]There's EMP.
[128:39.84]Were you watching when I had EMP?
[128:42.58]You literally turn off every single person in a 20-yard radius around you.
[128:47.46]You can just run through people.
[128:49.22]You can only do it once a run, though.
[129:01.47]It's definitely a fun game.
[129:04.65]Oh, Rawalz is in now?
[129:08.02]Whoops, kicked the wrong guy.
[129:08.96]You gotta go out, dog.
[129:20.53]See, one day, you're gonna run into that guy.
[129:23.59]Not like Pax.
[129:24.83]He's gonna have a really hot coffee in his hand.
[129:27.45]It is going to ruin my life.
[129:29.59]And he's just going to be like, he's going to see you.
[129:31.71]Hey, Star.
[129:34.05]Oh, man.
[129:34.70]Yeah, I was in your stream.
[129:36.96]And you, like, banned me a couple times when I was trying to play and just have fun and hang out.
[129:41.66]And, man, it's just so nice to me.
[129:44.18]Oh, whoops.
[129:44.74]And he's going to pretend spill his coffee right into your chest.
[129:48.80]Oh, whoops.
[129:52.29]And then you're going to know exactly what happened, but you can't say it.
[129:55.62]Oh, dude, it's alright.
[129:56.36]No, don't worry about it.
[129:58.16]And in his mind, he's like, got ya.
[130:01.98]You really want that to happen?
[130:05.20]What is it?
[130:19.05]Nothing's downloading.
[130:20.97]How much is it?
[130:23.43]I really just want to go make some food and bugger off.
[130:29.11]Who said you had to stream it?
[130:31.29]There's 15 duelers.
[130:34.33]I'm going to say goodnight for now.
[130:36.07]I'm going to say it's over.
[130:36.89]I would say there is a good maybe like 8 to 12 hour experience in this window.
[130:46.21]Maybe like 15 if you really want to play it a bunch.
[130:49.53]It's fun.
[130:50.70]It's fun for what it is, for sure.
[130:55.14]Well, good night, everyone.
[130:56.42]I'm going to go make some quesadillas.
[130:58.44]I bought the tortillas and the bacon this morning because you need bacon and everything.
[131:03.09]I'm hip and I'm cool.
[131:05.09]I'm going to watch a shitty TV show on my big screen that's out in the kitchen.
[131:10.13]TV in your kitchen?
[131:11.54]Well, I mean, the kitchen has, like, it's the island kitchen that, like, bleeds into the living room.
[131:17.71]Oh, right, right, right.
[131:19.23]It's not in the kitchen.
[131:20.65]Big screen in your kitchen is just, like, psycho.
[131:24.95]Yeah.
[131:25.59]Like, you have the microwave and then a giant TV that's so big you can't even open some cabinets.
[131:32.24]That's how you do it.
[131:33.26]Yeah, that would suck.
[131:34.36]Thanks, everyone, for coming, and bye.
[131:35.68]Bye.
[131:38.52]A flutter is getting demonetized because you're an asshole loser who spams birds and you've never done anything nice besides like gave me the only birthday present.
