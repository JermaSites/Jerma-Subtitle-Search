[00:09.14]Oh, get away from me, soldier.
[00:10.36]I'm doing my introduction.
[00:11.84]Hey, what is going on, everybody?
[00:13.48]Jermock here with Basecamp Fortress 2, Monday's edition.
[00:17.06]Playing as the Scout on King of the Hill Nucleus.
[00:22.21]Hold on, I'm just trying to sneak up on him.
[00:25.07]You gotta sneak up on him.
[00:26.95]Oh, he went falling down into hell.
[00:31.01]Yay!
[00:32.89]Oh, I didn't even tell you this setup.
[00:34.07]Whoa, this Demoman is gonna get me.
[00:35.99]No, he's not.
[00:39.67]Almost with the direct shot.
[00:40.67]Almost got me twice.
[00:42.03]Did he kill himself?
[00:43.55]No, he didn't.
[00:45.93]Pew!
[00:47.05]Strange scattergun.
[00:48.17]The Mad Milk and the... Oh, I would have hit him so easily!
[00:54.92]And the Sandman.
[00:55.92]I'm being all kinds of weird right now, guys.
[00:58.22]We have the point.
[00:59.16]We have the point.
[01:00.28]God, man, I almost got stuck.
[01:03.42]You are a spy.
[01:04.56]Woo!
[01:04.80]Woo!
[01:07.36]Alright, my heart just exploded.
[01:08.70]I thought the spy bumped into me and insta-killed me.
[01:13.34]That was very, very weird.
[01:14.32]Oh, but there's something I wanted to bring up in this video.
[01:16.86]I wanna talk about the Gray Man stuff.
[01:20.17]Not really into that much detail, but still, it's pretty ridiculous.
[01:23.69]I can't wait to see what's going on with that.
[01:25.81]If they introduce a new team into Team Fortress, the gray team, can you imagine the lunacy that that is going to accomplish?
[01:33.76]Like, how much insanity is going to happen with this game?
[01:36.60]It's going to be unbelievable.
[01:38.90]Ooh.
[01:40.30]No, I don't have the ball.
[01:41.14]I just used it.
[01:42.04]Oh, nice shot with the ball, you ball bag.
[01:45.00]There we are.
[01:49.38]I needed that.
[01:51.82]But there's all kinds of theories going around.
[01:55.36]My particular theory, if you want my theory on the Gray Man stuff, I think what's gonna happen, it's gonna be bots.
[02:03.39]It's gonna be non-player controlled characters.
[02:06.70]Brand new player models that are not controlled by anybody, and there's gonna be a massive amount of them.
[02:12.19]Hey, sorry for barging in like this, interrupting Facecam Fortress 2.
[02:16.37]Sorry, Jerma, we'll get back to you in a second.
[02:18.63]But this literally just came out less than one second ago.
[02:22.71]I rendered this video, this Facecam Fortress video, right after talking about the Man vs. Machine stuff and the Gray Man stuff.
[02:29.88]This just came out.
[02:31.50]This is exactly what I was thinking was going to happen, guys.
[02:35.18]It is the Man vs. Machine update.
[02:37.87]And it is going to be a brand new game mode, and it's going to be a huge, huge, huge deal.
[02:43.47]Now, there's a whole lot of information that I do not know right now, but I just wanted to let you guys know, if you head over to the TF2 website, TF2.com, it's right on the front page, and yes, it is going to be a mode where you fight against waves and waves of a gray robot team.
[02:59.82]This is ridiculous, and depending on how many missions you complete and how many waves you survive, you get probably hats, I think.
[03:07.20]You're gonna be able to get, there's probably gonna be new weapons.
[03:09.85]It is going to be unreal, and there's also a new movie, too.
[03:13.27]There's a new Source Filmmaker movie.
[03:15.15]So I just wanted to butt in here for a second and let you guys know about this, because this is brand new information that I did not see or hear of until less than, like, 30 seconds ago.
[03:23.91]So, we'll get back to Facecam Fortress 2 now.
[03:26.30]Hopefully, Man vs. Machine is going to be incredible.
[03:28.44]You can read all the biographies of all the new enemies, all the new robots.
[03:32.74]There are giants.
[03:34.28]There are giant robot heavies in this update.
[03:37.28]If you couldn't ask for anything more than that, I don't know what else you could ask for, but you can see all the information in the links in the description.
[03:43.18]So, yeah, guys, we'll go back to Team Fortress Facecam Fortress 2, and I'll see you guys all soon.
[03:47.70]Take it away, Jerma!
[03:49.33]So that's my theory, if you want it.
[03:52.15]If you want to hear what I have to say about that same sniper.
[03:59.78]Oh, I'm coming for you, man.
[04:02.20]I'm coming for you.
[04:02.82]You're going to have a bad day in a second.
[04:06.94]I'm going to come eat you alive.
[04:10.44]Is he still there?
[04:12.09]No, he's not.
[04:13.47]He's dead.
[04:14.91]He's dead regardless.
[04:17.13]I'm going to go the other way, though.
[04:19.74]But yeah, I think it's gonna be bots.
[04:21.04]We shall see.
[04:21.56]I am anxiously awaiting what it possibly is.
[04:25.94]It's gonna be so much fun!
[04:32.01]There he is!
[04:32.63]There's the sniper bastard!
[04:34.79]And he's dead.
[04:39.99]Are we gonna win?
[04:40.49]I think we're gonna win.
[04:42.09]I really think we're going to win.
[04:44.66]Hey, man, you've got that invincibility on.
[04:47.32]That's not fair.
[04:49.02]Whatever, I'll just go have fun at your birthday party.
[04:53.44]Did it not hit him?
[04:54.72]What is... What's going on with this dude?
[04:58.44]Guy was acting really fishy.
[04:59.80]Hey, what's up?
[05:00.44]Hey!
[05:00.94]What's up, sniper?
[05:04.65]Let us go again!
[05:05.51]The Scout thinks he's gonna get me!
[05:08.60]He almost did though, that was the thing, he almost did get me.
[05:13.82]No, no, no, no, no, get this Pyro out of here.
[05:16.90]Nice job, Heavy, nice job.
[05:20.26]You.
[05:21.88]Pyro, Mr. Pyro.
[05:26.50]Cap it.
[05:27.92]Cap it.
[05:29.70]Let me help you, let me help you with that.
[05:33.14]I got it, I got it!
[05:37.52]What's going on up here?
[05:38.52]Anything?
[05:38.88]Any parties going on?
[05:40.68]Any snipers?
[05:43.07]Any snipers that I can kill?
[05:44.55]Ooh, this guy down here, Spy!
[05:47.35]Landed right in his face.
[05:48.55]He's not dead.
[05:49.69]I would've got healed by that.
[05:50.81]That's not cool.
[05:52.71]That's not cool, man.
[05:56.35]Hey, Heavy, where's your, like, sandwich?
[05:57.65]Can I, like, swallow some of it?
[05:59.47]Ooh!
[06:05.98]Just freaked that guy out.
[06:08.40]I bet you that guy really just said and do it like That's not good.
[06:12.84]That's not good.
[06:14.22]Oh my good.
[06:15.20]Good job.
[06:16.54]Good job, dude That was a nice kill You saw the opportunity saw what I was doing and you didn't let me do it.
[06:27.75]That's a good medic.
[06:28.35]Oh
[06:29.85]Is this guy just like sniping people with the bison?
[06:34.95]He's killing people!
[06:36.61]Look at the top right!
[06:38.89]He is actually killing people with that, that's so awesome.
[06:42.01]Just sniping.
[06:47.62]Scout versus scout.
[06:51.56]Oh, spy behind me too.
[06:55.66]Don't want anyone... I don't... I just want to kill this Emi because he's the biggest threat and he's scary.

[07:34.43]Wow, this guy has really been up here the whole time.
[07:37.73]He is just a sniper soldier.
