[ve:60.16.100]

[00:52.50]Can't even get the fucking stream to go.
[00:54.51]Can't even get the stream to... Oh, there we go.
[00:56.01]Hi, guys.
[00:56.51]Hey.
[00:58.09]Hey, didn't see you there.
[01:00.61]Welcome to another stream that I'm doing.
[01:04.14]Sometimes I like to do this, and we hang out and play.
[01:07.78]So let's play.
[01:11.59]This is my sorcerer.
[01:12.37]I'm going to be left off before I beat the game.
[01:17.38]Those of you that do not know, the game was completed just wee hours ago last night.
[01:28.87]Are we going to see this crash again?
[01:30.09]I hope not.
[01:32.75]Oh, you just jinxed it.
[01:35.33]Man, this guy over here just jinxed it.
[01:40.75]How's my video coming?
[01:41.91]It's coming along.
[01:43.69]It's gonna take like another day though, and I'm just taking... I'm taking a break from thinking about it.
[01:49.13]Wanted to try a sorcerer, because this is like all I'm thinking about right now.
[01:52.38]You know what I mean?
[01:55.90]It's so hard to do anything.
[01:58.74]When there's something else totally on your mind.
[02:03.40]Like, I have this video that I've... I came up with the idea like a month ago.
[02:10.57]Filmed I filmed it like a week and a half ago And then Dark Souls 3 came out and it doesn't matter how much I want to just finish this video This is the only thing I want to do with my time my like smart my spare time is this game and nothing else So this is a sorcerer I'm going to go straight up magic guy I'm gonna dump points and intelligence
[02:41.61]And just be a caster.
[02:43.87]I don't know how well it's gonna go.
[02:46.42]I also want to try a little bit of PvP.
[02:48.00]I don't know how long I'm gonna stream for.
[02:50.98]This might not be a long stream.
[02:53.50]Because I do need to, like, finish.
[02:57.33]But I can't do it.
[02:58.43]Dark Souls 3 just came out.
[02:59.39]You know what I'm saying?
[03:10.96]Hey Orson.
[03:11.84]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[03:17.20]Hey laddie.
[03:19.28]Welcome.
[03:20.20]Thanks for the resub.
[03:23.83]How well does that track people is what I want to know.
[03:33.25]Really glad you decided to get out of your comfort zone after playing Bloodborne so you can play.
[03:38.61]I like this game a lot.
[03:42.43]Bloodborne is a very close cousin to this game.
[03:45.91]I would even say they're even closer than that.
[03:47.93]I think they might be brother and sister.
[03:54.34]Just right now, because this is Heavy Soul Arrow.
[03:56.84]How much does Heavy Soul Arrow do?
[03:57.98]A lot.
[04:01.90]I don't think it's necessary to use that at the moment.
[04:08.49]I can't two-hand this and have my spells be stronger.
[04:10.83]But I don't think I want to do that.
[04:13.37]I think I want to just stay, you know, in case I have to use this.
[04:19.02]Right?
[04:19.20]Like, don't make me use this is why I have this short sword on my left hand and mail breaker.
[04:25.78]You know, don't make me use this!
[04:27.54]That's really, that's it.
[04:30.28]I'm going to go this way.
[04:40.33]Okay, it's one shot for these guys.
[04:49.08]Would I say that Dark Souls 3 is harder than Bloodborne?
[04:50.96]Yes.
[04:52.42]I would.
[04:52.72]Because Dark Souls 3 is a combination of why Dark Souls was difficult and why Bloodborne was difficult.
[05:04.95]They took both the reasons why those games were hard and made them both harder.
[05:14.82]I don't think there's anything important I need over here.
[05:19.96]No.
[05:32.25]Seems to track pretty well.
[05:33.85]Oh, shit.
[05:34.27]I thought you were dead.
[05:43.72]The one problem I'm gonna have with playing a sorcerer is needing to have to do mana potions.
[05:52.20]Alive?
[05:56.69]Not anymore.
[06:00.03]But I did beat the first tutorial boss.
[06:03.61]And he was very easy as a sorcerer.
[06:06.18]VERY easy.
[06:09.22]You wanna... If you're having trouble in this game, if you bought this game and you're like, I can't even beat the fucking tutorial boss.
[06:15.64]Make a sorcerer.
[06:16.74]You'll beat the guy first try.
[06:17.76]Okay, let's go down.
[06:36.37]How much does this refill when you drink it?
[06:51.70]That's what he's saying.
[06:52.36]No, I mean, I don't know.
[06:53.72]Who knows how good sorcerer is or isn't in the late to mid game.
[06:57.28]I have no idea.
[06:58.64]All I'm telling you right now is that first tutorial boss, I didn't even have to try to beat him.
[07:05.97]You could just do this.
[07:06.81]You just stay kind of, you stay away and just do 100 damage to him.
[07:12.40]And just dodge his swings.
[07:13.88]And when he goes to phase two, you just stay away from him and cast the spell.
[07:19.60]It don't even matter.
[07:24.01]Yeah, that feels... It's pretty much the same as a regular Estus, isn't it?
[07:30.40]These guys are gonna be annoying.
[07:36.44]Come on.
[07:38.10]You know what?
[07:38.54]Fuck you.
[07:38.92]Huh.
[07:46.82]I found the bane of the sorcerer's existence.
[07:49.52]The guy with the shield.
[08:01.44]I told you, I didn't want to have to use this, but I'm gonna.
[08:13.11]Does Heavy Soul Arrow hit more than one person?
[08:15.97]Let's see if it hits more than one dude.
[08:19.12]No.
[08:20.52]It just does a lot more damage than the other one.
[08:26.14]Doesn't go through boxes, okay, good to know.
[08:34.66]It went through his body!
[08:38.21]Okay, well I'm pretty much out of mana.
[08:40.11]Listen to me, son!
[08:49.27]I'm your dad!
[08:51.67]DESTROY HIM!
[08:56.74]Moom.
[08:58.52]Moom.
[08:58.98]Thanks a lot, Moom.
[09:04.62]I'm actually going to... I'm going to put this in my main hand now.
[09:13.10]For now.
[09:19.12]Alright, let's go.
[09:20.74]I can't cast any more spelly spells.
[09:31.11]There's one guy at the end.
[09:32.05]You're gonna die.
[09:39.66]It takes so long to kill these guys.
[09:52.85]Shit.
[09:54.25]Can I actually do this still?
[09:55.25]Yeah, I can.
[09:55.67]I don't have any mana.
[10:04.02]I want to kick his shield, but it's hard to kick these guys' shields because they have the spear and they just have a hundred years of reach.
[10:18.46]Hey, wooden shield.
[10:27.44]I wonder how tough these guys... Oh, man.
[10:28.92]This guy's going to kick my ass.
[10:31.06]This guy's going to destroy me.
[10:34.82]Oh, boy.
[10:35.30]I don't have any mana.
[10:37.50]You can't hurt me.
[10:38.44]It's like punching a guy with glasses.
[10:40.31]I don't have any mana.
[10:41.07]Come on, man.
[10:47.57]I'm going to go level up.
[10:55.99]I'm not going up there.
[11:03.36]Uh, maybe... There's a ladder.
[11:08.64]Now, I wish I didn't buy Dark Souls 2 as my Souls game.
[11:10.96]I wish you didn't either.
[11:18.91]Because I would... I would say... I think Dark Souls 2... I just beat it two weeks ago.
[11:26.55]Uh, maybe my least favorite game in the whole series.
[11:39.64]Don't you have glasses?
[11:40.68]Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[11:41.58]You can't, like, punch me.
[11:43.20]You can't hurt me.
[11:44.70]I have glasses on.
[11:45.54]Okay, let me... I'm actually gonna do this.
[12:06.57]Yeah, by the way, this guy killed that guy too.
[12:10.83]He was extremely easy.
[12:17.96]Alright, is that too much weight?
[12:22.20]Not really.
[12:23.30]So now I can switch very easily between these two.
[12:27.20]Okay, so I want intelligence, right?
[12:30.94]Intelligence makes sorceries do more damage.
[12:33.48]Attunement.
[12:33.88]I have a shitload of attunement for some reason.
[12:39.65]I want, like, INT.
[12:42.65]I'll go with intelligence.
[12:51.48]I need a few more hundreds.
[12:54.02]I need a few more hundreds of souls.
[12:55.64]Okay.
[13:03.80]Yeah, I do wonder.
[13:05.64]So, sorceries...
[13:10.31]They get blocked by shields, so anybody with a shield is going to be the hard enemy for me in this game.
[13:19.32]You got a shield?
[13:20.16]Well, you're going to beat me.
[13:29.99]You guys, I don't need to even cast spells.
[13:31.49]I don't need to spam R1 on them and just die.
[13:54.97]It's so funny how long it takes to kill him.
[13:57.25]He's just flailing.
[14:03.16]It takes quite a long to shoot it.
[14:18.70]Get behind him.
[14:21.92]Get behind him!
[14:25.68]Too many cafeteria tables around here.
[14:27.44]Okay.
[14:37.15]Yeah, I don't need to have it in Sub-Bow anymore.
[14:38.47]I already beat the game.
[14:40.59]You guys are free to say whatever the hell you want about the game now.
[14:44.85]Let's see.
[14:48.97]You are already... I can't really do anything about you.
[14:51.41]Except for this.
[15:12.25]No, what?
[15:12.82]I thought I was logged on.
[15:13.72]I want to let go.
[15:19.54]Can I target up?
[15:20.28]There we go.
[15:21.46]No, what the fuck was that?
[15:22.76]I want to shoot the guy up there and not... I just auto-targeted.
[15:26.20]I need to turn that off.
[15:29.53]I have to turn off auto-targeting with the sorcerer.
[15:32.61]I'm just realizing this now.
[15:37.57]You guys talking about Toy Story?
[15:58.24]Toy Story 2 is okay.
[16:02.12]What was the best Toy Story, though?
[16:11.93]Yeah, kick him right in the shield.
[16:14.81]Alright, let's try this.
[16:15.85]Let's try fighting this guy as Sorcerer.
[16:18.67]Let's see what happens.
[16:20.95]Oh, I missed.
[16:43.57]Okay, that's better than getting the shit beat out of you by that guy, I will tell you that.
[17:11.53]I'm the kind of guy that starts food fights at school.
[17:14.38]What?
[17:14.96]I don't.
[17:16.48]Food fights?
[17:27.59]You can hit people with this too.
[17:28.53]How much damage does this do?
[17:33.49]Wow, what?
[17:34.02]That is a total joke.
[17:35.26]I'm not ever doing that again.
[17:46.69]Why don't I ever use my shield?
[17:47.95]Because I'm a Bloodborne guy.
[17:50.31]We don't use shields in Bloodborne.
[17:53.25]We go like this.
[17:54.01]We don't hold these up.
[17:56.07]We dodge.
[18:03.99]See?
[18:04.19]That's what we do when we play Bloodborne.
[18:08.65]I'm actually going to take the shield off.
[18:09.84]Thanks for reminding me to take it off.
[18:31.94]Actually, I want to do this.
[18:38.25]Bye.
[18:41.87]We don't use shields, we use guns.
[18:46.29]Well, one would say that using a gun... You know, bring a gun to a knife fight.
[18:53.85]As they say.
[18:54.65]Don't do that.
[18:59.60]But the parries, you want me to parry people as a caster?
[19:03.82]That's a way for me to get one hit killed.
[19:10.23]Once I have the opportunity, I'm going 100% spells.
[19:14.27]I'm only holding this thing because it looks cool.
[19:16.05]I'm going to take a cool picture with it.
[19:18.35]Oh god, my guy is so ugly.
[19:22.91]Grab some more stuff.
[19:28.81]I have a feeling this guy is going to be extremely easy.
[19:32.29]Well, not you, but you.
[19:33.25]Yeah, you too.
[19:33.67]Come on, get back up the ladder.
[19:39.33]Come on.
[19:42.59]You're swinging at a wall, dude.
[19:45.23]You are attacking concrete.
[19:47.60]Fine, I'll just drop down on you.
[19:53.30]Yeah, you can have staff in one hit.
[19:54.78]But I don't... I don't know.
[19:55.56]I like the...
[20:00.25]I don't like the hitting left trigger to swing.
[20:03.60]I don't like it.
[20:06.62]It messes with my brain.
[20:07.80]I feel like I'm trying to parry somebody.
[20:10.32]But whatever, I'll keep it on.
[20:15.01]I'm going to bait this out.
[20:17.81]And then kill this guy without any issue at all.
[20:26.16]Do I think Dark Souls 3 is worth buying?
[20:27.68]Absolutely.
[20:30.33]Hey, watch this.
[20:30.83]This is going to be great.
[20:33.51]Oh, no.
[20:34.85]What am I going to do about this guy?
[20:38.68]Come on.
[20:39.00]Get in range.
[20:43.06]Yeah, there we go.
[20:44.74]Oh, what am I going to do?
[20:46.41]I have to fight you.
[20:50.63]Will you just walk like another half an inch forward?
[20:53.35]You're really making this harder on me.
[20:55.95]Come on.
[21:09.27]I wanted to like prove a point how easy this was going to be and it ended up killing me for the first fucking time
[21:30.43]Shut up.
[21:30.87]Ring your bell some other time.
[21:31.93]I also can't backstab like this.
[21:53.50]You know what he did?
[21:54.02]He did his super dash move.
[22:05.77]Well, no.
[22:06.23]I wanted to kick him.
[22:07.13]Can I not kick him with this?
[22:09.09]I don't think I can kick with this thing in my right hand.
[22:13.96]No, I can't.
[22:15.36]That's another reason why I didn't want to do this.
[22:22.18]Well, this is really bad.
[22:23.16]We'll just boost it.
[22:35.08]It took a lot longer to cast.
[22:43.50]Yeah, this is sort of a thing in left hand.
[22:47.65]No way.
[22:48.11]I'm doing what I was doing before.
[22:50.01]Because if you go up with a guy against a shield guy, you might as well just let him kill you.
[22:56.15]Because you can't do anything to him.
[23:09.26]Who do I listen to?
[23:10.21]Who told me to do this?
[23:13.41]Why did you tell me to do this?
[23:15.31]I had a fucking plan.
[23:36.94]Whoa, what?
[23:37.24]I'm trying to drink something.
[23:37.96]What am I drinking?
[23:41.87]See, there was a reason why I wasn't doing that.
[23:45.12]Don't ask me why I put it back on the way that it was before.
[23:47.84]I have no idea why.
[23:52.88]Let me do what I was doing before, and I'm not going to change it.
[24:19.33]And we'll kill the lantern guy first.
[24:29.56]Where the hell did you come from?
[24:30.94]Oh my god, calm down, dude.
[24:41.85]Put the staff in the left hand?
[24:42.89]Can you even do spells if the staff is in your left hand?
[24:48.06]Oh, well, okay.
[24:48.77]I didn't know that.
[24:49.49]I guess you can do spells.
[24:52.15]Can you?
[24:56.79]Yes, you can.
[24:58.41]I did not know that.
[24:59.21]I thought I had to be here right now.
[25:00.69]So this works better.
[25:01.45]Yep.
[25:23.31]I didn't stun him.
[25:27.27]You know, I think it takes a little longer to cast spells, though.
[25:31.96]Am I crazy?
[25:32.68]Hold on.
[25:38.16]Yeah, that is taking longer.
[25:39.22]Oh, well.
[26:08.72]No, it's because I was using... Somehow I hit Heavy Solero.
[26:11.66]I don't know why.
[26:13.62]Yeah, I had it on Heavy Solero.
[26:30.05]Somehow I accidentally hit up.
[26:31.33]I don't know how.
[26:32.69]I don't know how.
[26:43.68]I really would like you to get stunned, man.
[26:53.76]Actually, here's a funny story.
[26:56.80]I made another character that is a two-handed, just straight-up strength character.
[27:03.38]I beat the first three bosses in maybe an hour and 25 minutes.
[27:08.01]Maybe less than that.
[27:09.87]This is actually a lot more difficult than I thought it was going to be.
[27:25.78]Gamer problems, right guys?
[27:41.02]Strength builds are really op in the early game.
[27:42.66]Yeah, they really are They really are you got that right see if I can hit this guy with a heavy Before he even knows it
[28:02.38]Yeah, I just put on like a two-hander and I just like crushed the first like three areas of the game I have a feeling though like as It's not the bosses.
[28:16.67]It's when you get like more than one enemy is where this is actually hard to do It takes you a long time to cast things and you're a little weakling That wasn't a backstab
[28:38.51]Shit.
[28:40.21]Oh, come on.
[28:42.71]Not like this.
[28:43.79]Man, I'm already, like, dead.
[28:48.77]I wanna be caster guy.
[29:06.99]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[29:12.00]Hey, Stoke.
[29:12.94]What's going on, dude?
[29:13.62]How are you?
[29:14.36]Thanks for the sub.
[29:15.96]Did I finish this game?
[29:16.70]Yeah, I beat it last night.
[29:20.76]Uh, I'm gonna die.
[29:23.36]I need to get, like, in the swing of things.
[29:24.78]Because, like, the whole game I'm so used to playing with, like, my katana.
[29:28.70]That... Oh, no.
[29:29.54]Here's the bonfire.
[29:30.00]I forgot.
[29:32.02]Going... It's, like, two different extremes.
[29:34.88]Excuse me.
[29:35.42]That I need to get used to.
[29:53.54]Do you like that spin move?
[30:05.25]It's like a completely different way of playing the game.
[30:08.24]I'm kind of moving around and playing it like I would if I was playing my Dex character.
[30:12.10]Which I can't really do that.
[30:14.46]You gotta be more careful.
[30:18.33]Slower.
[30:20.57]More deliberate.
[30:25.96]I didn't even want to do that.
[30:26.70]I wanted to get the guy next to him.
[30:28.80]Yeah.
[30:42.31]That's one of the strong points of the Souls games.
[30:44.59]Yeah, no, it's great.
[30:45.93]I love that I... I love that I have to, like, relearn this game.
[30:49.93]It's fun.
[31:04.99]Okay, let me not have what happened last time happen again.
[31:07.39]This time I'll throw, like, a firebomb at him to get him close.
[31:19.82]He didn't even do it?
[31:22.14]What, he doesn't do anything?
[31:26.92]Come on.
[31:28.70]Oh, no!
[31:29.56]Oh, no!
[31:30.94]Oh, no, he's doing his move!
[31:45.79]20 of these.
[31:46.07]Are you kidding me?
[31:49.73]Let's see.
[31:50.13]Can I reach?
[31:51.09]No.
[31:54.27]This isn't going to happen again.
[31:55.33]I'm going to get killed again.
[31:56.53]I'm not going to get off the ladder.
[31:59.78]Come on.
[32:04.74]Really going to do this to me right now?
[32:09.85]See, sometimes he comes down here.
[32:12.39]Usually he doesn't stay up on the roof.
[32:15.09]Alright, hopefully I can stun him with this.
[32:17.51]What is he doing?
[32:18.07]What the fuck is he doing?
[32:20.57]You see that?
[32:20.83]He was, like, bobbing up and down.
[32:21.85]That wasn't enough to get him to move?
[32:30.78]Oh my god, fine.
[32:31.70]Ah!
[32:40.95]Bye.
[32:41.43]Okay, here we go.
[32:58.54]What?
[33:00.12]What?
[33:01.16]Oh my god, he went through the whole thing?
[33:04.46]This dude was so angry, he went through concrete to hit me.
[33:08.69]Look at that, he hit me like back here.
[33:20.10]Get out of here!
[33:24.72]Well actually, this is scary.
[33:27.84]Now that I know he can do that.
[33:28.84]Alright, I'm just gonna let him try.
[33:32.99]I'm gonna let him reset for a second.
[33:47.42]That's loud.
[33:52.15]Ooh, Titanite.
[34:02.44]Free souls.
[34:05.58]Free.
[34:07.26]I heard they were free.
[34:18.93]Something about that is funny.
[34:22.94]So where I'm going to be scared here, guys, is at this first actual boss of the game.
[34:28.86]Because he moves around a lot.
[34:31.87]I wonder what... how bad that's going to be for me.
[35:08.51]Yeah, the scream is always ten times louder.
[35:10.19]Don't ask me why.
[35:11.85]But I might be able to do some disgusting, smelly, gouda cheese on this guy.
[35:16.27]Oh yeah, I can.
[35:17.39]Watch this one.
[35:19.24]Oh, hey.
[35:20.84]Sorry, dude.
[35:21.52]I didn't mean to hit you there.
[35:24.62]Oh, do you have a big, scary axe?
[35:29.50]You do.
[35:32.66]Well, you better let the poor fellow out then.
[35:39.56]Can't walk on again?
[35:46.55]I'm using these to attract him.
[35:52.46]Here he comes.
[35:53.02]I wonder what I'm gonna do.
[35:57.36]See, in situations like this, uh, sorcery seems like really, really stupid.
[36:03.94]But if a guy has a shield... Oh, come on.
[36:08.54]Then it's worse.
[36:11.70]Come on.
[36:23.21]I got him!
[36:25.47]Oh man, that was so fucking hard!
[36:32.44]Now I can go down there and collect my spoils.
[36:40.72]Now there is a guy in here.
[36:43.26]There's a couple guys in here.
[36:44.14]I wonder how this is gonna fare.
[36:46.32]Not this guy.
[36:46.76]I'm talking about the guy inside.
[36:56.98]There's a knight in here, I think.
[36:59.24]Somewhere around this area.
[37:00.08]If I remember.
[37:04.06]Now I'm just free to walk around here.
[37:09.61]Alright, I'm starting to get in the swing of things.
[37:13.49]Starting to understand sorcery.
[37:17.86]Oh shit, the rapier.
[37:20.38]Locked in the corner there.
[37:30.00]Yeah, apparently he's walking around doing sorceries.
[37:35.74]Yeah, I heard about that guy.
[37:42.06]There's a skip over here.
[37:45.62]Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.
[37:47.06]I don't think I did.
[37:47.64]Let's go.
[37:48.02]That guy didn't drop anything, huh?
[37:53.03]I didn't even get that item.
[37:53.83]Whatever.
[37:58.93]Right up here.
[38:02.69]Ooh!
[38:09.64]Forgot about that guy.
[38:10.51]I didn't hear about that guy.
[38:28.56]We're just going to skip.
[38:30.78]Bye guys.
[38:31.34]It was nice to see you again.
[38:33.54]A couple of throwing knives.
[38:50.23]I actually did hear about that.
[38:51.47]I've heard about that thing that you're saying about the dancer.
[38:55.77]Out of ammo.
[38:57.70]Oh, shit, guys.
[38:58.40]I can't do this.
[38:59.24]Out of ammo.
[39:10.08]Ah, shit.
[39:11.66]I'm out of ammo.
[39:17.01]Oh, come on.
[39:17.81]He's still chasing me.
[39:22.04]Go back to work.
[39:26.20]Are you seriously that dumb?
[39:27.63]Come on.
[39:29.69]You're gonna snipe me from over here?
[39:32.77]What a smart dude.
[39:33.77]How did you get up here?
[39:34.55]Okay, bye.
[39:49.96]Are you serious?
[39:51.24]Let me get out of here.
[39:52.50]Do I really have to kill this guy?
[39:59.57]Or they really just won't... Okay, I have to... Apparently have to, like, kill these things.
[40:10.15]Now you're gonna let me leave?
[40:11.03]No, you're not.
[40:14.15]You're not gonna let me leave.
[40:17.85]I think I'm just going to die.
[40:21.93]Because these things are so dumb.
[40:23.57]They will not just get out of the way.
[40:25.09]Get out of my like game aggro range.
[40:28.63]To determine if I'm in combat.
[40:37.05]Finally.
[40:39.56]Finally.
[40:40.06]Do I prefer jello or pudding?
[40:49.52]Pudding.
[40:51.18]I'd say.
[40:53.93]Int.
[41:01.25]It's all about the int.
[41:05.71]I wish there was a way to see.
[41:06.65]I guess I just don't know.
[41:08.42]Is there a way to see how much damage each point of intelligence is getting me on this weapon?
[41:22.20]Like, physical... It doesn't really... It doesn't really tell me much.
[41:29.76]You know what I mean?
[41:32.66]Is it, like, 60?
[41:33.88]And then that's, like, the scaling with intelligence brings it up?
[41:43.09]Listen, I... I'm telling you right now.
[41:46.09]I don't know.
[41:50.64]Oh, fuck.
[41:51.10]I forget which one it was.
[41:52.52]Listen to me, son.
[41:55.00]I'm your dad.
[41:57.42]Destroy him!
[42:00.87]Whoa!
[42:02.15]Excellent French champagne.
[42:06.51]Thank you for subbing.
[42:07.53]I think you were expecting a different sub sound.
[42:12.47]Were you not?
[42:15.17]I think you were expecting the other one.
[42:17.62]It is the other one.
[42:22.66]But anyway, regardless, thank you for subbing, dude.
[42:24.32]Welcome.
[42:26.78]No, it is this one.
[42:36.35]Dog.
[42:36.71]Dog.
[42:38.33]Dog.
[42:39.99]Dog!
[42:42.41]Dog!
[42:43.55]Where's the dog?
[42:52.49]Where was the dog?
[42:53.03]Was that a figment of my imagination?
[42:57.85]Or what?
[43:04.92]Where did the dog even come from?
[43:06.40]He's not even- Where's the dog?
[43:16.52]And now I have to pull the lever again.
[43:24.05]I'm not fighting you.
[43:25.49]As much as you want me to, I'm not fighting you.
[43:29.69]Don't activate it.
[43:30.93]Don't activate it.
[43:33.22]Please.
[43:33.98]Don't step on this.
[43:38.16]Get away from me.
[43:39.72]You're worse than the dog.
[43:40.76]Oh, you... Is he dead?
[43:48.35]Is he dead?
[43:58.10]I just drained him.
[43:58.94]I just flushed that guy down the toilet.
[44:02.42]He better not be down here.
[44:05.37]He better not be alive down here.
[44:07.75]With his axe waiting to hit me right in the fucking head.
[44:16.69]You fucking idiot.
[44:18.49]Of course he is.
[44:19.19]Alright, well you can just stay angry over there, buddy.
[44:24.35]I'm done with you.
[44:35.72]Uh, forget all of you guys.
[44:37.04]I'm just going over here.
[44:43.65]Can I make that jump?
[44:45.29]You guys are just relentless.
[44:46.39]Get away from me.
[44:48.73]All three of you had to come straight down.
[44:50.69]Is that what you're trying to say?
[44:53.19]You can't make that jump.
[44:54.65]I'm certain of it.
[44:55.75]So, nice to know you.
[45:03.53]God.
[45:09.12]What got into these guys right now?
[45:15.81]Fuck it.
[45:17.33]This is not the way I wanted to go.
[45:18.57]I wanted to go down this way, but all these fucking guys are just everywhere.
[45:24.49]What the hell was that?
[45:38.27]I just, like, skipped through that.
[45:40.95]Was that anything, like, good?
[45:42.49]I didn't even see what it was.
[45:44.51]I didn't expect these shit-ass bum enemies to drop anything decent.
[45:52.32]Alright.
[46:02.80]Let's go.
[46:08.21]These guys should be pretty easy, I think.
[46:12.61]Although they do have shields, which, you know, that's the bane of my sorcery.
[46:17.57]But, let's see what I can do.
[46:26.60]Oh, he blocked that one.
[46:30.10]Attack?
[46:31.66]Attack?
[46:34.16]Jeez.
[46:41.58]It's just barely not enough to kill him.
[46:47.24]But that works out real well.
[46:49.47]This is so much better than how I was doing it before.
[46:52.37]There's a hard guy up here, isn't there?
[46:58.55]Let's go kill hard guy.
[47:03.95]You guys ready?
[47:04.39]You guys ready for me to kill hard guy?
[47:06.07]This is gonna be hard guy.
[47:08.61]He's gonna be hard!
[47:31.26]Oh, I got him.
[47:31.84]I got the hard guy.
[47:33.00]You didn't drop anything else?
[47:38.31]That's all you had?
[47:43.59]That guy was excruciating when I came up here the first time.
[47:49.60]Excruciating.
[47:53.58]Those of you that were here, like, five days ago, four days ago, when I first started the game and I got here.
[47:57.98]Remember how ridiculous that guy was?
[48:00.36]Fighting that guy for real?
[48:04.21]Remember how hard that guy was actually fighting him?
[48:16.77]Once they get close, that's where it's game over, man.
[48:28.76]Mmm, you smart.
[48:32.41]Smart.
[48:36.21]Good for you.
[48:38.83]You learned.
[48:39.95]You learned a thing or two.
[48:52.76]Hey.
[48:55.02]Who do you think you are?
[48:56.26]I can do that too.
[49:02.88]Makes a really weird noise it goes like Listen for the meow you'll hear it and then you can't unhear it ever again It's like somebody going like Why is the Sun emote?
[49:31.32]Smaller than the Jupiter emote, because Jupiter is the biggest mass in the entire galaxy.
[49:38.41]Jupiter is the biggest mass in all of existence.
[49:43.41]Of course it's going to be bigger.
[49:44.33]Alright, so this is the second playthrough.
[49:50.71]This is going to be a special request.
[49:53.69]This is a special request playthrough.
[49:56.67]Where, here we go.
[49:58.35]You guys ready for the special request?
[50:03.71]I'll give you the special request in a second.
[50:09.18]I do want to refill.
[50:10.90]I need to refill.
[50:12.22]Where's my McDonald's cup?
[50:19.86]I'm going to go back.
[50:20.52]I'm going to change weapons.
[50:21.62]I want to refill.
[50:23.96]And then I'm actually going to do the skip rather than run around the skip.
[50:30.27]Maybe level up once.
[50:31.61]And then we're going... I want to do something.
[50:33.61]Because... It's my life.
[50:37.41]It's now or never.
[50:38.81]I ain't going to live forever.
[50:39.69]You know what I mean?
[50:40.11]I'm just going to live while I'm alive.
[50:46.27]Because... I want to see what happens here.
[50:48.67]Oh, shit.
[50:51.36]I'm out.
[50:57.80]You're still here.
[50:59.20]You're still here.
[51:01.50]You still haven't figured out how to walk out of the door.
[51:05.60]Man, that guy's not bright.
[51:09.64]He turned around, he was like, hey, I know we might have had our differences, but can you tell me how to walk out of the door?
[51:16.42]I just, I can't figure it out.
[51:22.88]It's weird, because I went to law school, too.
[51:37.16]Yeah, I'm going to put on other weapons.
[51:38.22]I just wanted to take a second.
[51:39.62]Because I'm going to try something.
[51:41.77]And it might be quite fun.
[51:52.19]Um... Attunement 9.
[52:00.10]Health.
[52:01.68]I'm going to get Intelligence to 20.
[52:04.80]And we'll go from there.
[52:07.95]But let me see what I have for gear.
[52:09.11]I'm still in my, like, fucking default Undertaker robes.
[52:24.96]This guy looks like such a fucking idiot.
[52:32.77]Alright.
[52:35.47]The rapier.
[52:38.08]I already had enough 95.
[52:39.06]Yeah, let's put this on.
[52:43.84]Now, how does this fare?
[52:47.24]That's cool.
[52:49.72]I think I actually... Because I did a dex playthrough before.
[52:53.00]I'm fairly certain I actually... So I can do that.
[52:58.23]Okay.
[52:59.77]I used this for like a second or two.
[53:01.07]In the last playthrough, I think.
[53:02.63]If I remember.
[53:03.25]Alright.
[53:05.91]Now, we're going to try something.
[53:09.27]Everyone's probably going to freak out about this, but I want to try it.
[53:12.01]I'm just going to do it.
[53:14.17]It might fuck up the entire rest of the game, but... You know, sometimes you got to do... Sometimes you got to... It's the second playthrough.
[53:23.78]You got to try something.
[53:28.42]Sometimes you just got to do something, you know?
[53:39.09]There he is.
[53:39.51]Hey, hold on, hold on.
[53:46.61]Stay there one second.
[53:47.59]I'll be right back.
[53:49.57]Oh, fuck, he's back.
[53:50.85]Oh, damn it, I gotta use the bathroom.
[53:52.15]What a terrible time for diarrhea.
[53:55.29]Where's my Pepto-Bismol?
[54:05.52]Holy shit, you guys all just kind of woke up.
[54:27.36]Why would you shoot me that close?
[54:29.16]Why wouldn't you just put the thing away?
[54:31.20]So I can do anything else.
[54:37.33]Okay.
[54:38.39]I want to do this.
[54:39.95]It's very important that I do this.
[54:42.01]I'm going to kill these guys.
[54:50.63]I'm going to try something real screwed up.
[55:00.48]Man.
[55:02.12]That is so easy.
[55:07.75]Especially the point... It's just... That is just... That is just, you know what I mean?
[55:28.90]Alright, here we go.
[55:31.88]You guys ready?
[55:35.26]I must warn the people that are here, this might be like the beginning of the game.
[55:39.82]This might be like the first, like the second, quote, technical boss.
[55:46.17]Shield your eyes if you don't want to see like potential spoilers like much, much fucking later in this game.
[55:54.18]So, shield your eyes if you don't want to see a potential late-game spoiler.
[55:58.84]Don't look.
[56:00.30]And come back in, like, ten minutes.
[56:02.48]Alright?
[56:03.64]Okay.
[56:04.04]You've been warned.
[56:16.15]What's gonna happen?
[56:18.23]My dear prince... Lothric...
[56:26.07]Are you serious?
[56:26.85]Can I?
[56:30.34]Oh my god, are you serious?
[56:33.72]Hold on, you can... Can you skip this entire fucking game?
[56:44.75]Theoretically, can you skip the entire fucking game?
[56:53.20]If I, like, go up though, can I, like, go up here after this?
[56:55.96]I'm gonna get destroyed.
[57:09.59]Alright, now this one, this one, this one.
[57:10.71]Oh yeah, you do need all the ashes.
[57:13.17]What did I do this for then?
[57:14.80]Oh my god.
[57:15.44]This is like a fucking mid to late game boss.
[57:19.54]I got you.
[57:21.64]Okay, I just gotta make this happen.
[57:23.28]Come on.
[57:38.41]That's so funny that you can do that.
[57:41.69]That's so awesome that you can do that.
[57:43.53]That's so awesome.
[57:45.37]That makes me happy.
[57:49.82]Hey, funny story.
[57:50.80]I beat that boss first try.
[57:53.12]Yeah.
[57:53.78]Mm-hmm.
[57:54.82]Yep.
[57:56.00]Beat that boss first try on my first playthrough.
[57:58.84]Yep.
[57:59.40]Yep.
[57:59.96]Hey.
[58:00.48]Hey.
[58:01.30]Yep.
[58:10.38]Now let's actually go fight that I didn't bring it back up.
[58:17.06]So now here's the problem.
[58:18.68]Does that fuck anything up for the rest of my playthrough?
[58:31.74]That's not a lie.
[58:32.26]I remember who I did it for.
[58:35.04]Mr. Crunchman, a subscriber.
[58:36.82]Mr. Crunchman subscribed and told me to destroy the boss.
[58:41.10]And I said I have to do it on the first try.
[58:42.78]And I did.
[58:43.86]It was a direct Mr. Crunchman shoutout.
[58:46.80]You can ask Mr. Crunchman.
[58:52.36]It was in his name.
[58:58.04]All that does is spawn the boss early?
[58:59.36]Okay.
[59:01.23]So those of you that were shielding your eyes, you can unshield them.
[59:06.05]We're back to reality now.
[59:12.01]Let's go fight boss.
[59:15.53]This might actually be... I got a feeling this is going to be kind of hard.
[59:19.33]Because this guy moves around a lot.
[59:22.25]We'll see.
[59:24.51]We'll see.
[59:26.19]We'll see, gentlemen.
[59:28.03]And ladies.
[59:36.30]Yeah, the legendary Mr. Crunchman.
[59:39.52]Alright, let's try it.
[59:41.12]I also want a PvP tonight, too.
[59:43.73]So... I don't know.
[59:46.11]Sorcery was really just kind of... I wanted to see what it was like.
[59:50.03]Oh my god, this guy is so ugly.
[59:54.24]We'll see.
[59:54.66]We'll give it maybe a couple attempts on this boss.
[59:56.54]If I don't kill him the first try.
[59:58.08]Which I might.
[59:58.96]Or I probably won't.
[59:59.72]Who knows.
[60:07.25]Alright, let's go.
[60:07.77]Okay.
[60:17.90]I'm just gonna not be greedy and I should kill this guy.
[60:28.79]Oh.
[60:44.81]You know, I do see one problem with this.
[60:48.46]It's complacency.
[60:49.48]See what I'm talking about?
[61:02.26]Like, I'm just getting too, yeah, I'm getting, like, too comfortable.
[61:07.88]You get, like, so used to just sitting back and like, I'll just shoot you.
[61:12.33]I'll just shoot you.
[61:15.87]Alright, well, now that I... It's like... Dashing around and, like, dancing around him, you're like... You're in the fight.
[61:25.10]I wasn't in that fight at all.
[61:26.20]I wasn't even fighting that guy.
[61:31.78]I'm just, like, sitting back there, like, pressing L1.
[61:34.06]I wasn't even fighting a boss.
[61:37.64]Oh, fuck you!
[61:39.62]Get... You know what?
[61:40.24]I'm just going back to the fucking bonfire.
[61:46.21]Put a password on the PvP with us?
[61:47.55]Yeah, I'll do that.
[61:48.43]That sounds fun.
[61:59.36]But it sort of takes you out of the game a little.
[62:05.24]And dodging attacks is a lot harder to do because you're not in the fight.
[62:17.94]Even if it is, like, easier, I'm not sure if I like it.
[62:21.62]Because it's hard to, like, keep the rhythm.
[62:24.10]Rhythm is the word I'm looking for.
[62:25.22]Like, keeping in a rhythm in the fight.
[62:27.18]It's like a dance between two people.
[62:29.74]Like, he's coming at you.
[62:31.40]I move.
[62:31.78]Then you move.
[62:32.46]Then I move.
[62:34.04]And then we both move together.
[62:36.74]You're going to do this move.
[62:37.90]And we're both going to move.
[62:39.45]I see you coming.
[62:40.51]I'm going to jump this way.
[62:42.65]I just stand here and press a button looking at you.
[62:49.89]Yeah, make a bow guy too.
[62:51.27]It's just like a to- You know what it is?
[62:52.59]Here's what's gonna have to happen, right?
[62:55.19]I'm putting away all thought of attacking him.
[63:03.65]I'm going to shoot him two times and then fight him.
[63:08.27]Shoot him two times and then fight him.
[63:09.51]Because I don't want to get, like, locked in where you're just, like, spamming L1 and then eventually he gets close to you and you're kind of like, oh shit, what do I do now?
[63:16.91]I have to play the game?
[63:17.97]I have to actually play?
[63:22.54]Let's try it again.
[63:26.48]Oh, hold on.
[63:27.24]Let me deal with this guy that just magnetized his spear into my neck.
[63:40.77]Too far away?
[63:42.41]Apparently I'm too far away.
[63:43.35]He's on lockdown.
[63:44.21]Okay, now I'm gonna play.
[63:54.31]Okay, there's the chance to do it.
[63:56.79]Mm-hmm.
[64:30.58]I don't want to start a cast too early.
[64:32.82]Oooh!
[64:53.30]Oh shit!
[64:57.64]That's another thing, like switching between all these things.
[65:02.55]Yeah, the thing about sorcery is a lot less visceral and more about timing.
[65:05.70]Which is why I'm not liking it.
[65:08.72]I'd rather fight the guy than have to think about, like, casting a spell.
[65:12.44]Let me get these off my bar.
[65:15.02]It's completely different.
[65:17.96]You have to... It's like... The cast time is there.
[65:21.78]There's a lot to think about.
[65:23.44]Get out of here.
[65:36.77]I feel like it'd be the same thing using a... This guy needs to calm the fuck down.
[65:41.27]Now, you know what?
[65:42.03]Just... You're gonna do it again and you're gonna get stuck down there, fine.
[65:44.45]You know... Fuck you.
[65:45.59]I feel like it's the same thing when you're playing with a bow.
[65:59.40]I feel like they're both... In the same realm.
[66:16.03]It's like you're guaranteed to do 60 damage on every hit on him.
[66:21.18]But that 60 damage takes you like a full 3 or 4 seconds to do it.
[66:28.92]I'll get it.
[66:29.34]It's just a completely different playstyle.
[66:33.64]And I want to do it.
[66:34.68]I want to play Sorcerer.
[66:36.08]Just straight up Caster.
[66:37.09]And I had a hunch.
[66:40.27]I had a hunch.
[66:41.89]I had a hunch.
[66:44.07]That it might be a little bit more difficult against bosses because of how fast bosses can move in the game.
[66:49.70]And how much it's about timing.
[66:51.02]Alright, let's play.
[66:51.64]Let's do it.
[66:52.04]Here we go.
[66:52.36]He's not on the ground for a long time.
[67:07.49]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[67:19.26]I have an idea.
[67:21.50]Mmm, maybe not.
[67:36.90]Second phase is gonna be harder.
[67:52.43]I gotta, like, get distance on him.
[68:05.96]Shit, I'm in trouble.
[68:06.90]Okay, here we go.
[68:27.89]Get some more distance.
[68:38.48]Fuck, he's so close.
[68:45.84]Damn it.
[68:47.98]Oh man, where am I?
[68:48.98]I'm inside of him.
[69:47.06]Woo!
[69:52.56]That was actually a lot harder than I thought it was going to be.
[70:10.48]I got really really really lucky.
[70:13.41]Real lucky.
[70:17.01]Because when I got stuck inside of him that time, he happened to do the third dash right into the wall.
[70:23.66]Alright, now I need to pay close attention.
[70:42.14]Yeah, that was hard.
[70:45.75]Let's go over a couple things, right?
[70:48.53]This is awesome.
[70:49.87]This is fucking awesome.
[70:51.09]You know why this is so awesome?
[70:54.13]Because I have to play this game again for the second time, and I'm not comfortable at all.
[71:01.14]At all.
[71:04.70]I'm relearning everything, essentially, with this character.
[71:10.77]That's really cool.
[71:20.00]Okay, reinforce.
[71:23.28]You don't reinforce a staff.
[71:26.56]Or maybe you do.
[71:29.14]Plus one?
[71:32.68]This goes to A scaling.
[71:34.20]I might just do this.
[71:36.11]Titanite shards, they drop like crazy.
[71:41.77]Ready?
[71:45.22]Let me go see where the boss soul is.
[71:47.53]Oh, I don't even have it.
[71:48.17]I have to kill the, uh... Oh, no!
[71:51.55]I just thought of something.
[71:54.58]The tree boss?
[71:57.50]The tree boss is going to be... How am I going to target his limbs?
[72:03.54]I kind of do that.
[72:04.91]Okay.
[72:08.09]Yeah, whatever you say.
[72:14.05]I already know.
[72:14.93]You're like really... Whatever.
[72:16.49]Let's just level up.
[72:28.04]Sorceries.
[72:28.68]I want to do magic attacks.
[72:30.24]That's what I'm doing.
[72:30.86]Magician.
[72:32.38]The guy's name is Majesto.
[72:36.22]I have a lot of attunement.
[72:56.71]You had to melee him as your sorcerer?
[73:01.96]It's never real yet.
[73:02.84]It's... I don't know.
[73:06.36]I'm having fun.
[73:09.27]I need to find more spells.
[73:10.19]Does anyone know who sells spells?
[73:14.25]No idea.
[73:16.07]All of this is brand new to me.
[73:40.16]Oh, cool.
[73:40.70]Raise the banner.
[73:45.72]Oh, does he really?
[73:48.30]That dude that randomly died for no reason?
[73:51.91]Cool.
[73:53.57]Free aim your spells at the tree.
[73:56.07]That's going to have to be one of the... That boss is an optional boss.
[73:59.87]I might not even... I kind of have to.
[74:03.95]But as strict sorcery...
[74:07.14]I'm not sure how to fight that boss.
[74:09.42]That boss is going to take me 100 years.
[74:12.27]Because I'm going to be swinging at it with a little rapier.
[74:14.55]I'm just going to have to be really careful.
[74:30.32]You use the moonlit greatsword way more than sorceries.
[74:32.58]You know, we'll see how it goes.
[74:35.81]There is a... There is a chance that I might just get too aggravated.
[74:41.35]That's what I do, you know.
[74:42.25]I'm aggravation.
[74:45.09]Hey, look up aggravation.
[74:45.91]You see a picture of my fucking mug in the dictionary.
[74:52.24]Go to aggravation in the dictionary.
[74:53.38]You got a picture of my fucking mug.
[75:08.16]Yeah, sub only chat is gone.
[75:09.36]It was only there for the brief few days, or what, four or five days it was there.
[75:19.12]My first playthrough because I didn't want to look over at chat and have somebody, you know, screaming at me to turn around and open the secret door that was behind me.
[75:32.21]I'm trying to backstab him.
[75:33.25]I can't target these guys.
[75:36.37]God.
[75:38.67]Now, I heard... I heard that dexterity actually decreases cast time.
[75:47.07]Is that true?
[75:47.93]If it is, I might want to do... These guys are kind of destroying me right now.
[76:00.11]Mmm, boy.
[76:00.75]I might even die here.
[76:14.06]Jeez.
[76:14.42]That was way more of a pain in the ass than I think it should have been.
[76:20.90]That is true.
[76:22.16]Okay.
[76:23.74]Is it worth me putting points in decks if I want... I think that's what's going to have to happen.
[76:28.46]If I want to be straight up just spellcast man, if I want to just only use sorceries and dark magic or something, whatever the hell it is, I guess then I'm going to have to... I don't want to go there yet.
[76:45.12]Put points in decks.
[76:51.33]This is fun.
[76:51.73]It's a whole new game.
[76:52.65]It's a whole new ball game, guys.
[76:54.13]That's why it's so fun.
[76:55.79]It's a whole new game.
[76:56.65]Because that cast time really could help a lot.
[77:15.35]In fact, I'm sure it will.
[77:17.46]What is my dex right now?
[77:20.58]12.
[77:21.32]It's not terrible early, early.
[77:25.00]What class was I?
[77:25.72]I was Katana.
[77:27.26]I was a dex class.
[77:29.52]Pretty much straight up Katana in Endurance.
[77:37.65]Hey!
[77:39.21]Oh, then it's true.
[77:41.05]A champion of Ash as I live and breathe.
[77:45.89]Yes, I would love for you to be my friend.
[77:50.40]I like this guy.
[77:56.72]Hey, thanks.
[78:00.98]The problem with sorcery in Dark Souls 3 is that it hasn't changed since Dark Souls 1, but the enemies have.
[78:05.88]They're faster and more aggressive.
[78:10.26]Yeah, I can see that.
[78:12.89]Essentially like my spells are the same exact cast time and travel distance in Dark Souls 1 But the enemies are like blood-borne blood star beasts I'm just glad that you can do it from level 1 Because in the previous Souls games Wasn't it like you kind of had to go halfway through the game before you got any spells that did any damage to anybody?
[78:40.56]Bloodborne was the same way.
[78:41.50]If you did, like, Arcane in Bloodborne, you literally, LITERALLY, LITERALLY had to get to the end of the fucking DLC, the very end of the entire video game, to get the one item in Bloodborne that was actually, like, a Arcane item.
[79:10.15]Why don't I just pull that?
[79:13.19]Now there, like, Arcane was weird in Bloodborne because it was based around, like, gems.
[79:16.59]Like, you put, like, gems.
[79:17.39]You could scale Arcane if you put, like, a blood gem.
[79:20.21]Like, not a blood gem, a... Let's say you put a fire gem into a sword.
[79:25.60]Right?
[79:26.18]You put a fire gem into a sword, and it scales with your arcane stat.
[79:30.52]That's fantastic, but we're talking straight up, like, magic damage, like, arcane damage.
[79:34.87]There was one item in the fucking entire game, and it was... Let's say you build a character based around arcane.
[79:41.25]The whole thing... I want to be, like, a mage or something.
[79:43.61]I want to be, like, do spellcasting.
[79:45.43]You have to finish the entire game into the DLC.
[79:47.78]The entire DLC to get the one item in the game that does that.
[79:50.94]And I might be being a broken record reiteration here, but I can't believe that that was the case.
[79:59.63]Although Arcane was a little different in Bloodborne.
[80:01.77]It was not supposed to be... There were spells in Bloodborne, but it wasn't a thing you were supposed to do at all times.
[80:20.64]But please don't get me wrong.
[80:21.60]Bloodborne is by far one of my favorite games ever made.
[80:25.43]I love that game.
[80:31.38]There's the parry shield.
[80:32.26]I think I should go back and see if I can buy any sorceries from that guy.
[80:43.96]When I need to go back, I'll go back.
[81:03.56]Blades of Mercy and Tauntatress.
[81:04.93]Yeah, but the thing about Tauntatress was, it was a strength weapon.
[81:09.11]You, you had, you, you put points into strength to be able to even put the thing on.
[81:14.65]It was a, you still had, I'm talking like straight up, like, a, an item in the game that was designed to be used as like, for that one particular stat.
[81:24.77]That scaled off of that stat.
[81:27.11]Like for instance, Soul Arrow, this is intelligence.
[81:29.21]This is just straight up, this is a magic, just magic.
[81:34.86]And Arcane was weird in Bloodborne, because nobody knew, like, what to do with it for the first, like... The first, like, week of the game was out.
[81:41.90]People were just like, why is this stat in the game?
[81:45.06]It was a very weird, I would say, useless stat.
[81:48.67]Unless you want to do a very weird, like, Moonlit Greatsword build, which is what I did.
[81:53.39]It was cool.
[81:55.35]But it's like, when you have a stat in a game that really can only be used by maybe one or two items in the whole game, it's, uh, I don't know.
[82:06.28]It was definitely cool.
[82:07.54]But it's my one complaint of Bloodborne is that Arcane was very underdeveloped.
[82:14.13]It was just, hey, throw a gem in a weapon.
[82:15.95]And now it scales off Arcane.
[82:17.45]Alright.
[82:28.52]This is going to be difficult.
[82:33.96]Do a luck run?
[82:34.74]That would be fun.
[82:39.51]Ligarius' wheel.
[82:40.35]That was blood, though.
[82:40.95]Didn't that scale off of blood?
[82:44.39]Blood was also weird, too.
[82:45.43]Because blood... There was the... There was the katana.
[82:50.17]Which was like the blood katana in the game.
[82:52.25]There was Ligarius' wheel, which was also blood, right?
[82:58.52]Your one complaint?
[83:01.72]Look, I'm nitpicking here.
[83:02.86]I would have told you that.
[83:07.97]I'm nitpicking on this game, too.
[83:21.60]I don't want to pull this.
[83:24.62]This is guaranteed death if I pull everybody here.
[83:28.80]I'm going to go down this way.
[83:33.33]I believe this is the... I want to... Where is it?
[83:36.95]Where's the tower?
[83:41.05]I believe this is the progress route.
[83:44.85]There might be a bonfire down here.
[83:51.87]Best weapon was a saw cleaver.
[83:54.28]Pre-DLC, I think that Ludwig's Blade was, uh... I just... I... So many people had it.
[84:01.28]Everybody had that thing.
[84:02.82]Because it was like B and B scaling in both strength and dex.
[84:05.34]That thing was fucking crazy!
[84:07.24]Keeping it crazy.
[84:11.82]Thank God I accidentally touched that guy and he got staggered.
[84:14.10]This is for me, son!
[84:16.10]I'm your dad!
[84:18.54]DESTROY HIM!
[84:23.78]My criteria.
[84:26.88]Thanks a lot, welcome.
[84:39.68]What's your criteria?
[84:41.58]Why do you have this much health?
[84:44.50]What the hell?
[84:45.94]This dude's got like a greatsword?
[84:47.24]Alright, well, here.
[84:53.27]Ooh!
[84:55.03]I shot it underneath him.
[84:56.35]Or over him.
[84:57.11]Or something.
[85:04.38]Magic seems good.
[85:06.28]It is and it isn't.
[85:07.48]It is and it isn't.
[85:16.05]What's the way to get past that?
[85:25.94]I think this is all dead end stuff.
[85:28.54]These guys just throw shit at you.
[85:29.68]Hey, look, I can throw shit at you now too.
[85:31.26]If I could target one of yous, that would be great.
[85:41.49]Fucking clay pot guy.
[85:42.57]Uh oh.
[85:46.37]Where did that guy just come from?
[85:48.53]Somebody just died.
[85:49.20]People are dead.
[85:50.66]I'm out of mana.
[85:52.83]Yeah, this is a runaway situation.
[86:00.19]Fill up on stuff.
[86:10.94]Isn't there another... I mean, I got that door, but... I gotta go to, like, the bridge.
[86:17.54]I think it's the other direction.
[86:18.85]I'll just go get that.
[86:19.61]Because that's where the tree boss is.
[86:24.72]And this is when mage sucks, yeah?
[86:26.57]There's like not much I can really do right now.
[86:31.65]Even if I had full health, I'd still have to hit people with a rapier.
[86:38.60]I could go and allocate another flask.
[86:43.28]Which I might do that.
[86:44.05]Yeah, I'm going to do that.
[86:44.89]Just for early, because...
[87:04.78]Eskir, I'm going to read what you said.
[87:08.32]I know you're talking to somebody else, but I want to be part of the conversation too.
[87:16.67]What I'm saying is that kind of weapon doesn't even exist as far as in our own Dark Souls.
[87:21.21]I mean, no, but I'm casting spells right now, and it's scaling off of my intelligence.
[87:28.26]You know what I mean?
[87:35.13]Hey.
[87:36.17]Reaper.
[87:36.83]Or is it repper?
[87:37.63]Thanks, man.
[87:38.47]Do I have enough?
[87:39.13]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[87:42.42]I don't have enough.
[87:42.96]I do want to go talk to that dude down here, too.
[88:02.71]My problem with Arcane and Bloodborne was not the fact that magic wasn't in the game.
[88:07.28]It just... It felt like a stat that seemed kind of tacked on.
[88:16.16]Where is he?
[88:16.50]He's down here, right?
[88:20.46]I'm gonna hang out over here somewhere.
[88:26.55]Where are you?
[88:27.57]Where are you?
[88:31.27]Where is this little stupid little fucking... Ugh.
[88:42.02]These areas.
[88:48.76]Oh, our champion of ash.
[88:52.27]Welcome home.
[88:55.43]This pilgrim...
[89:01.52]Okay, sell me some stuff.
[89:07.72]Magic weapon.
[89:08.48]Reinforce right weapon with magic.
[89:10.98]Magic shield.
[89:13.81]I already have these.
[89:15.05]That's a lot of souls. 4500.
[89:30.25]Okay.
[89:31.11]Well, I thought I was going to have enough to buy something.
[89:33.25]Apparently not.
[89:34.35]Actually, I forgot to do the thing that he, like, doesn't he give you a free level but makes you hollow or something?
[89:53.02]This NPC is really confusing, because he gives you a free level, and then you get an item in your inventory.
[89:57.56]Ooh. 5,000.
[90:14.30]Soul Greatsword.
[90:16.39]Attack with a greatsword formed from souls.
[90:20.05]22 intelligence.
[90:20.73]I'm getting... Oh, come on.
[90:21.97]Let me get that.
[90:23.47]Be safe, champion.
[90:27.13]Oh, I... Be safe.
[90:34.77]20 intelligence.
[90:35.29]I need 22 intelligence and a bunch of souls.
[90:38.95]That's good to know.
[90:40.11]I'll just level up again.
[90:40.95]Who cares?
[90:42.21]Who cares, you know?
[90:43.60]One more.
[90:52.95]Oh, I wanted to reinforce to get another... ...another Estus Flask for the drinky drink.
[91:13.61]I mean, that's skimping myself with health, but it's okay.
[91:20.41]Whoa!
[91:20.65]Killer... Agio.
[91:21.25]Agio.
[91:22.79]Killer Agio.
[91:37.34]Now this is doing 106.
[91:37.80]Seems to be scaling pretty well!
[92:02.77]I also need to learn to not just use that, even though I'm telling myself, you know, I'm going to use sorcery only.
[92:08.69]I do have a mana bar.
[92:10.39]So I'm only going to use it when enemies actually need to be hit with it.
[92:14.97]At least for the time being.
[92:17.73]You know, that right could change.
[92:19.81]That right could change.
[92:21.45]But not right now.
[92:25.95]Come on, mate.
[92:27.77]Come on, say what you're going to say, mate.
[92:31.48]Okay.
[92:33.36]Didn't mean to shoot that into the wall.
[92:35.66]Apparently it did.
[92:40.74]Look at this little bugger down here.
[92:44.15]Fuck.
[92:45.45]Ah, fuck!
[92:48.95]Wish I could cheese him out.
[92:58.66]Really?
[93:00.40]Okay, well that worked out.
[93:06.25]This is an accent stream?
[93:07.38]Yeah.
[93:07.94]You came to the finest accent stream.
[93:10.52]East of the Mississippi.
[93:20.40]Nice.
[93:21.54]I get to cosplay as Oogie Boogie Man from Nightmare Before Christmas.
[93:24.47]It's too bad I'm not like a big fat guy.
[93:32.81]Really?
[93:33.59]Really?
[93:34.57]Really?! !
[93:37.46]Really?
[93:39.42]No, actually really.
[93:42.95]Actually really.
[93:52.47]Why can I still hit footsteps?
[93:53.81]Is somebody else down here?
[93:55.93]Better not be.
[93:58.33]I'm going to get the... Straight ahead down here.
[94:02.18]I can get the other... The other...
[94:09.93]Bonfire.
[94:13.05]Go downstairs and do the other bonfire.
[94:17.13]Hurry!
[94:19.27]Shit.
[94:23.67]My headset is getting caught in the wire.
[94:25.53]I need to fix this.
[94:27.83]This is important.
[94:28.55]My, like, head is being pulled to the left.
[94:30.05]Hold on.
[94:33.53]Get over here, please.
[94:35.33]Oh, fuck.
[94:36.01]I just unplugged my headset.
[94:37.13]Where is it?
[94:51.53]I was underneath my desk, like, grabbing this thing.
[94:53.85]God, what a fucking pain in the ass, huh?
[94:58.63]Stupid piece of shit desk.
[95:01.15]I'm gonna fucking sell this to a lumber liquidator.
[95:05.80]I'm gonna fucking throw this thing into fire.
[95:10.53]Great.
[95:11.13]Oh, that's fucking great.
[95:12.63]Now I wasted all my estuses because my piece of shit headset had to get stuck.
[95:17.12]Hold on.
[95:17.72]Calm down.
[95:19.22]Hold on a second.
[95:21.70]Hold on.
[95:22.48]Calm down.
[95:25.30]I need to make sure I'm safe because I have to unplug this again because it's, like, caught now.
[95:31.95]Stupid ass thing.
[95:38.41]If my face had a desk.
[95:40.33]If my desk had a face, I'd punch it in the face.
[95:46.49]I would just punch my desk in the face right now.
[95:48.34]If it had a face.
[95:48.94]Don't drive angry.
[95:59.98]That was just... That was so angering.
[96:03.14]Why did I lose?
[96:04.00]Why did I lose my lock on?
[96:14.16]I'm gonna wash, huh?
[96:15.86]I'm gonna break.
[96:20.80]Yeah, you guys are putting the salt thing, and yeah, it's true.
[96:23.88]I am fucking mad right now.
[96:28.78]I had to, like, unplug my headset, and apparently two farmers decided to come attack me that were just walking slowly around.
[96:38.14]I am so dead here.
[96:40.46]Get the death counter ready, because it's gonna happen right now.
[96:57.41]I was just lucky You're not even dying to a boss no, I'm dying to I'm dying to my desk which that should never be an issue I Should sorry guys get the death count already.
[97:14.77]I have a dumb desk I
[97:26.81]Okay, I just have to wrap around here.
[97:28.97]This is going to be fucking so hard without any health.
[97:32.40]I have to play like a total, total cheese ball here.
[97:36.86]Or I might have to go with the run strat.
[97:38.14]Because that person over there is going to get me.
[97:50.46]Make sure no one's going to fall behind me.
[97:52.02]Okay, it might be time.
[97:58.90]I'm going to come back here, but I think the sprint strat just to hold down sprint and get to the bonfire.
[98:07.51]Let's go.
[98:21.54]Because this brings you underneath to the bridge, right?
[98:25.95]Oh, shit.
[98:26.75]I'm getting invaded, too.
[98:29.47]Yeah, it's right there.
[98:42.53]Can I move?
[98:43.35]No, I don't have enough.
[98:50.37]I want to fight that guy.
[98:51.97]I feel like I could beat him pretty easily like this.
[98:53.65]Alright, invade me again.
[98:57.56]Come on, invade me.
[99:00.10]Invade, invade, invade.
[99:01.06]Here he comes.
[99:01.70]Alright, let's see if I can smoke this guy for free.
[99:04.98]You know what I mean?
[99:06.26]I'm going to heavy... No, no heavy solar.
[99:12.40]That's too risky.
[99:16.48]Where'd he go?
[99:20.23]What the hell?
[99:20.65]What is he doing?
[99:21.21]Did you forget where I was?
[99:23.75]Get down here.
[99:25.81]Just invade me.
[99:27.55]You're holding the two-hander.
[99:29.12]There we go.
[99:31.02]Okay.
[99:33.70]Lost lock on again.
[99:35.50]Doesn't matter because this guy is not even going to get near me.
[99:37.54]Okay.
[99:48.84]He's like trying to do a move, too.
[99:51.23]I'll do that.
[99:54.35]He just keeps looking at the fire in his hand.
[99:56.29]Oh, you dick.
[100:02.33]I'm not sure what this guy's trying to do, but I can Heavy Soul Arrow him and probably kill him.
[100:06.54]He's just drinking potions.
[100:08.14]Will you fucking stop?
[100:11.12]Stop.
[100:11.50]Stop.
[100:18.27]fire oh there it is I lost it okay he's dead I'm gonna go buy my soul thing now my big sword
[100:47.30]Yeah, that guy's RNG.
[100:49.62]His AI was locked into doing that one fire move because I was too far away.
[100:57.93]But that's where sorcery shines.
[101:00.75]When the AI is just a moron.
[101:03.91]A total idiot.
[101:06.34]Because the AI... Dark Souls AI has trouble with you when you're far away.
[101:13.95]Soul, great sword, magic weapon.
[101:15.47]So, soul, great sword.
[101:16.49]In fact, with a great sword formed of souls.
[101:18.21]Let's do it.
[101:20.95]I'll buy it from you, buddy.
[101:23.11]Thank you.
[101:33.82]I should have let him cast.
[101:34.64]He would have died faster.
[101:37.62]Well.
[101:39.44]I can't use the spell yet, though.
[101:43.94]I need one more.
[101:44.62]150, 150.
[101:47.68]How much does it cost to use it?
[101:49.16]7, 11, 28.
[101:49.28]This is gonna take, like, a third of my FP bar.
[101:51.99]Like, this is gonna be, like, 20% of my FP.
[101:54.63]Hopefully it's worth it.
[102:10.26]Dark Souls AI.
[102:11.16]They either roll a 1 or they roll a 12.
[102:13.28]That's all there is to it.
[102:17.09]Can't do anything else.
[102:17.75]I'm just going to go back.
[102:27.88]I'm going to make my way to the tree.
[102:53.51]And make quick work of those guys.
[102:59.29]That's... I love and I hate sorcery.
[103:03.12]Because situations like that are fantastic.
[103:09.94]But bosses seem to be slightly more... Slightly much more difficult.
[103:15.24]Come on, throw it.
[103:29.36]Whoa, what?
[103:31.34]Where did he throw it?
[103:31.96]Anyway, there's an ashen bone flask thing over... Oh, you were in the darkness.
[103:52.08]I want to get the items.
[103:58.86]There's another item right here.
[104:01.78]Cleric!
[104:04.16]Maybe I'll put all that on.
[104:24.93]Come on, throw it.
[104:25.43]Come on.
[104:29.74]I told him to throw it and he threw it.
[104:30.70]I'll just go make nice with him.
[104:44.23]Making nice with him will make this easier.
[104:45.81]Because I do want to get that bone shard, the bone ash thing.
[104:57.93]I really thought I dodged that, too.
[105:02.01]I was prepared for it.
[105:02.97]I was waiting for it.
[105:03.71]This is the scythe, which I'm not going to use, but I'll sell it.
[105:21.06]You think Kastris has an easier time to start off with Soul Arrow?
[105:25.12]Well, they wanted to make
[105:26.64]casting in this game a viable starting class which they did but it's just a question of how viable is spell casting you know when you get into the mid game into late game because it's hard for me to imagine how the last boss you guys saw how you know how much he moved around a lot of bosses are extremely aggressive in this game
[105:56.50]to a point where I kind of can't even imagine a world where I'm going to be able to cast one spell at a boss.
[106:04.23]Like Pontiff.
[106:06.33]Pontiff Sullivan.
[106:06.97]You think I'm going to be able to cast a spell at Pontiff Sullivan and not insta-die?
[106:11.11]It's going to be interesting.
[106:12.61]But, you know, that's what we're doing.
[106:15.35]But, you know, that's what we're doing.
[106:24.47]Actually, I want to go this way.
[106:25.98]I opened the door, so it's fine.
[106:33.69]That's kind of annoying, I will tell you.
[106:36.82]When it breaks.
[106:38.62]Here's a quality of life improvement.
[106:41.00]You want to hear what I think should be a quality of life?
[106:43.20]Listen.
[106:45.74]The lock on symbol.
[106:48.80]See how it's white right now?
[106:50.84]If you're about to be out of range, it would be cool if it could be like tinted red.
[106:56.25]Like, hey, you are about to step out of range.
[106:58.31]It is like slightly tinted red.
[107:02.27]It would make you not, you know, because it's hard to tell sometimes how far away you are.
[107:11.58]I wanna go do this.
[107:13.48]Why not, right?
[107:22.77]Dirty magic user.
[107:29.46]He was gonna throw it.
[107:31.06]He just faked me out.
[107:57.51]He was so determined to throw that pot the weight the weight took him forward so hard he fell off the cliff I Just wish I didn't dodge that would have been such a great like clip to watch I
[108:11.44]I dodged backwards.
[108:12.36]I thought he was going to throw it.
[108:25.79]Would you lock on?
[108:26.51]I'm going to go talk to Siegfried.
[108:54.51]I think this is just an ember or something stupid.
[109:03.25]Yeah, he still threw it into the bridge.
[109:04.59]That was so awesome.
[109:05.49]I just wish I didn't dodge.
[109:06.64]I wish my brain decided not to work and I just watched that perfectly.
[109:12.54]Okay, so... This is where the rat cave is and this is where the skip is.
[109:30.67]He went too far around me.
[109:36.64]Okay, where is it?
[109:37.50]Can I grab one of you rats without having to?
[109:42.06]Apparently not.
[109:48.35]There's a very high possibility that I could get overwhelmed by these rats.
[110:08.66]Rats.
[110:11.18]What's the other spell?
[110:12.10]It's Heavy Soul Arrow.
[110:14.06]It's a much longer cast, but does much more damage.
[110:16.24]I'll show it to you.
[110:18.18]See, this is like rat that's hiding in the mist over here.
[110:22.73]See, it takes a lot longer, but it's 200 damage.
[110:26.23]Sometimes even 200 damage.
[110:38.51]I wish this was a cleave weapon.
[110:47.81]Okay.
[110:48.13]Here's the door to open to skip this whole area to go to the tree.
[110:53.09]I never opened this in the last playthrough.
[111:06.41]And... Okay.
[111:09.87]There's the bonfire.
[111:10.63]There's the bonfire.
[111:16.39]Excellent.
[111:17.29]We found the bonfire.
[111:22.30]There's a twinkling Titanite up there.
[111:25.32]But I don't care.
[111:26.54]Just wanted to get the skip.
[111:31.21]Another Jerma rumble?
[111:32.45]Yes.
[111:33.73]It is actively being worked on.
[111:37.28]It's actually one of the main things I think about every day.
[111:43.16]You'll see it.
[111:45.65]In the next couple months.
[111:47.95]I can't give you a perfect time frame.
[111:49.77]But I think about it every damn day.
[111:51.77]It's being worked on.
[111:54.87]You'll see.
[111:55.49]I don't have any bone stuff.
[112:05.06]I don't have any bones.
[112:12.09]I'm going to go level up one more time and attune my spell.
[112:21.68]The only other information I'm going to give you is it's probably going to be the best video I've ever made and ever will make.
[112:27.21]I will never make a better video.
[112:28.73]It's never going to happen.
[112:30.89]That's all you need to know.
[112:32.83]It's going to be very difficult for me to ever upload a video ever again that's better.
[112:38.40]That's all I can tell you.
[112:41.84]That's all I'm going to tell you.
[112:58.15]Farron Dart.
[113:02.65]Fire Soul Arrow?
[113:03.81]Soul Arrow Farron Dart?
[113:06.51]I don't have this.
[113:09.46]I'm gonna buy this.
[113:12.76]Farron Dart.
[113:19.27]Okay, that's a miracle.
[113:20.01]What does that do?
[113:21.65]Let's see what it does.
[113:36.08]Farron Dart.
[113:41.13]So it's just a quick... Ooh!
[113:48.11]Oh, I like this a lot.
[113:51.43]You can... It's like... You can just keep it going.
[113:58.66]Okay.
[114:00.30]I like.
[114:03.02]Now let's get the other one on there.
[114:04.84]Do I need 18?
[114:05.10]No, I need more.
[114:06.98]Okay.
[114:20.18]Can the creative process be stressful, especially if a video hasn't been out for a while?
[114:24.85]I think about it all the time.
[114:25.75]I mean, it's been like a couple weeks since I've had a video go up.
[114:30.61]I blame that mostly on this game because I got like really... I still don't have enough.
[114:38.20]I actually... Here's the time frame.
[114:39.38]So I went on vacation.
[114:42.56]And then after vacation, I... I want to sell some things.
[114:50.19]After coming back from vacation, I was going to... The video I have is pretty much done.
[114:54.17]I just need to get it done.
[114:57.82]But when I vacationed, I got back from vacation.
[115:01.94]I started playing Dark Souls.
[115:05.62]Just a lot of things started happening.
[115:08.25]I stopped working on the video.
[115:12.01]That's supposed to be up today, tomorrow, the next day.
[115:17.13]I got to check more walls.
[115:19.03]I hit a lot of walls in my last playthrough.
[115:21.91]A lot of them.
[115:25.63]Okay, get rid of this stupid dirty forks.
[115:30.04]Now let me put on my new sword.
[115:34.37]But yeah, I mean, I think about it.
[115:38.83]You don't want people to be like, where is this guy?
[115:42.87]Does this guy even make videos anymore?
[115:45.47]It's like, yeah, I do.
[115:47.47]It's just the ones I'm working on at the moment are literally... I say literally a lot, don't I?
[115:53.65]It's literally.
[115:54.65]I feel like I'm some kind of fuckface.
[116:00.18]I don't know.
[116:01.16]Who's a fuckface that you guys know?
[116:02.94]That's me.
[116:07.50]Maybe I should go back now.
[116:10.70]I'm gonna keep it the way it was.
[116:17.94]So, I feel like this might be worth doing, just to get it to A scaling.
[116:25.15]But does it really matter?
[116:26.09]Spell buff 109, 110?
[116:26.65]I guess not.
[116:41.20]Okay, I'm gonna take off Heavy Soul Arrow.
[116:44.60]And put on the Greatsword.
[116:45.49]Let's see.
[116:46.41]What does this do?
[116:50.59]Soul Greatsword.
[116:53.25]Wow.
[116:55.55]Can I do that more than once?
[116:56.41]Holy shit.
[117:08.60]It's a very long, big sweep, though.
[117:14.22]Yeah, I'm just going to upgrade it.
[117:18.08]B to A, whatever.
[117:20.08]Titanite drops like candy anyways.
[117:21.82]I'm not sure the use of how... I don't know.
[117:36.54]We'll see.
[117:36.80]It costs a lot.
[117:41.75]Costs a lot.
[117:43.19]It's pretty neat though.
[117:47.71]Cleave unlocked.
[117:48.83]Yeah, I did.
[117:52.90]Let's just hit a dude with it and see if it's worth it.
[117:54.42]I don't want to hit that guy.
[117:58.90]That guy's too dangerous.
[118:00.44]I'm going to go through the skip.
[118:06.66]Couple of rats.
[118:07.36]Alright, let's try it on the rats- rats.
[118:13.63]Alright, that's, um... That's okay.
[118:18.27]That's pretty cool.
[118:19.91]It's just a huge cleave.
[118:21.84]How far does it go?
[118:24.24]Pretty far.
[118:27.70]It's a... That is almost 180 degrees in front of me, too.
[118:30.42]So... I'll hold on to it.
[118:35.39]Now we get to have the fun... Oh, hold on.
[118:43.95]I'm gonna put on the grandma set.
[119:00.35]And these are staying on?
[119:07.71]This guy does not have a chin.
[119:10.05]He has a bottom lip and then his face ends.
[119:18.68]Did I play the other Souls games?
[119:19.88]I did.
[119:21.44]I played Dark Souls 1, Dark Souls 2, Bloodborne, and this game.
[119:26.55]But I never completed Dark Souls 1 because I got to Blighttown, I beat Blighttown, realized I had to turn around and backtrack through the whole game, and said I don't want to play this gameberger anymore.
[119:38.05]That's it.
[119:40.01]I want to go over here.
[119:42.09]Let's try out my new dart.
[119:42.96]Let's see if this guy's an it-it-it again.
[119:44.44]An it-it-it-it again.
[119:51.07]Oh, I thought he was going to be an idiot.
[119:56.24]That really is like a tiny amount of damage.
[119:58.42]I don't know if I like this one.
[119:59.30]15 damage?
[120:10.20]Yeah, that's pretty much frisbeeing a toothpick into people.
[120:15.89]This move sucks.
[120:21.14]This move looks cool.
[120:22.06]This is like a good pull move.
[120:23.72]If you want to pull somebody.
[120:25.06]But it's not good for killing anything.
[120:36.90]Okay.
[120:50.15]Tight Night Shard.
[120:52.55]I'm going to go over here.
[120:53.33]I have to pee, though.
[120:54.81]God damn it.
[120:59.74]They don't flinch.
[121:00.80]I see that as a... I don't want to spend mana, but I want to pull one guy.
[121:04.12]Okay.
[121:27.17]I'm going to go this way.
[121:29.03]Why is that guy not aggro?
[121:30.28]What is this guy doing?
[121:40.84]I'm trying to push him off, but... I don't have a kick anymore.
[121:45.18]That's why.
[121:45.77]It would have been funny if I kicked him off.
[121:52.71]But this weapon does not have a kick.
[121:54.19]It has a...
[122:01.28]Hi, I know you.
[122:04.54]Alright, spoiler alert.
[122:08.63]Spoiler alert.
[122:09.85]I'm about to say a spoiler.
[122:11.23]Spoiler alert.
[122:13.69]This guy.
[122:14.11]I don't know what he does for like a quest or whatever, but... Again, spoiler alert.
[122:20.43]Mute the stream for 20 seconds.
[122:22.39]3... 2... 1... This guy drops a...
[122:31.42]If you kill this dude... He drops that mace.
[122:36.84]And it is... The, like, best... It's a miracle mace.
[122:42.29]The thing requires 50 fucking strength and 30 faith.
[122:47.07]It seems to be insane.
[122:49.37]But, I don't know.
[122:50.23]If you want, like, a huge two-handed guy...
[122:54.49]Alright.
[122:55.55]Spoilers are done.
[122:57.41]You're now allowed to talk.
[122:59.35]Me.
[122:59.81]Talking about me.
[123:00.61]Not you.
[123:01.99]Hey, you.
[123:16.96]I feel bad for people that are here for the first time and not being able to take in the second playthrough.
[123:22.10]I'm like skipping everything.
[123:28.54]Bye.
[123:30.05]I'll be back.
[123:39.21]Why would someone be concerned about spoilers if they're watching a stream?
[123:42.97]Well... Some people might come in thinking that this is my first time playing the game.
[123:49.91]And... You know... Maybe they're more inclined to...
[123:59.83]not want to hear things because they think they're going to see just the early game.
[124:07.09]And plus, that's like a very specific thing.
[124:08.97]Like, that guy drops X and Y if you do X. Hmm.
[124:15.29]Let me tell this guy to leave me alone.
[124:20.40]Somebody wanted a close-up of the face.
[124:22.16]There it is.
[124:24.72]Hold on.
[124:32.02]This guy doesn't have any bones in his neck or his chin.
[124:39.93]There is just skin hanging right there.
[124:42.05]That's disgusting.
[124:44.88]He doesn't have a jawbone, it's just skin.
[124:51.48]Just a bird.
[125:03.43]I help anytime.
[125:07.93]I help anytime.
[125:11.34]Who are you?
[125:12.90]I help anytime.
[125:16.24]I... Thank you.
[125:20.52]Thank you.
[125:32.46]Hey, what are you doing over here?
[125:39.54]Hey, what are you doing here man?
[125:43.48]Cool.
[126:01.71]You have solved the riddle.
[126:02.55]Great.
[126:06.25]Alright, now let's go.
[126:08.38]You guys ready for epic showdown?
[126:11.96]It's gonna be so epic.
[126:15.16]Oh, I love epic.
[126:17.08]Epic.
[126:23.65]Alright, come on.
[126:28.60]What's he doing?
[126:35.94]Wow, I almost just jumped off the fucking cliff to try to avoid this fire, but I still didn't avoid it.
[126:42.76]What took you so long?
[126:43.94]What was he doing up there?
[126:45.60]He usually comes down way sooner than that.
[126:49.60]He sat up there.
[126:50.66]The last time I played this game, he came immediately down.
[126:54.12]That dude sat up there and took his fucking time.
[126:57.85]He's supposed to just come down.
[126:58.93]That wasn't epic.
[127:07.91]He waited until, like, the monster was killing me before he came over there.
[127:13.35]Stupid asshole.
[127:14.33]I should just kill that guy.
[127:20.73]Oh shit, I forgot about this.
[127:21.79]I forgot if you came here too early, every enemy spawns on the bridge.
[127:41.39]Ugh, epic.
[127:46.77]Oh fuuuck, I thought it was going down.
[127:49.47]Isn't that the food fight?
[128:06.64]What's with the food fights?
[128:10.02]What is that food fight?
[128:10.97]What do people say in food fights?
[128:12.31]Yeah, are you gonna actually help this time?
[128:20.71]Are you actually gonna come down?
[128:25.76]Or what?
[128:27.62]Let's go.
[128:35.80]Hey, move your ass.
[128:54.11]Come on, get aggro.
[128:54.99]I didn't even get him.
[128:58.10]Get over there.
[128:58.46]I'm gonna help.
[128:58.96]I'll help you, dude.
[129:24.93]I seem to be pissing him off.
[129:27.77]Watch this, buddy.
[129:29.90]No, no, no.
[129:30.72]I was pissing him off.
[129:37.56]Zigward.
[129:38.82]Squidward.
[129:40.52]I'd really appreciate the help.
[129:41.48]Here we go.
[129:41.76]Look at this one.
[129:46.56]Oh, yeah.
[129:46.84]I got him.
[129:49.24]Keep him distracted.
[129:49.84]Here we go.
[129:55.92]Dear, that just, I'm just, this is just, my adrenaline is pumping.
[130:03.40]Oh, shit.
[130:10.16]Dude, my adrenaline just got, my adrenaline's fucking pumping.
[130:16.05]Why does he turn to do this to me?
[130:20.37]I should just be attacking him.
[130:24.53]I gotta get the final sword slash.
[130:28.36]Okay.
[130:29.36]I don't have enough ammo.
[130:38.20]Final hit.
[130:42.90]Oh no.
[130:47.84]Can you die?
[130:49.01]Can you die?
[130:49.97]That'd be great.
[130:53.60]What was he doing?
[130:54.40]He was missing every swing.
[130:55.44]Thank God for Squidward.
[131:05.32]Thanks for the drink.
[131:06.22]Anything goes to sleep.
[131:41.25]You look around and you're like, oh, somebody woke me up.
[131:52.28]Oh, I have to pee.
[131:53.76]I think I'm in a safe spot.
[131:54.92]I think I can pee safely.
[132:00.16]I'm pretty sure I can pee safely over here.
[132:02.06]I hope it's safe.
[132:04.06]I'm going to do a test run.
[132:05.04]We're going to go to sleep over here.
[132:08.21]So I can go pee.
[132:10.19]Alright.
[132:11.33]Good.
[132:12.59]I don't think there's any... Nobody's shooting arrows at me.
[132:14.45]Nobody coming down here.
[132:15.45]Alright.
[132:21.76]I will be back.
[132:23.78]Two minutes.
[132:24.70]I'm going to take a pee-pee.
[132:26.06]Be right back. ...
[134:38.40]Alright.
[134:45.47]What the fuck?
[134:46.47]Ew, it's really loud.
[134:49.65]Would you guys just grow up?
[134:53.13]Would we please just grow up?
[135:03.04]I can't wake up.
[135:07.18]I can't move.
[135:09.27]I'm stuck here forever.
[135:09.95]I'm not even kidding.
[135:11.29]What's going on?
[135:15.55]What the hell is happening?
[135:20.62]What?
[135:21.48]Okay.
[135:31.63]I'm up.
[135:37.99]Sorry, I dozed off there.
[135:39.19]My USB input got screwed up, so I had to stay asleep.
[135:50.10]Now, there's a ring up here that I want, but there's also two Ursulas that I don't want to deal with.
[135:57.67]There is some good items here, though.
[136:01.05]But you do have to deal with an Ursula.
[136:03.23]Who the fuck wants to deal with Ursula?
[136:17.88]Not only is there one Ursula, there are two Ursulas.
[136:24.42]Hit the rafter, you can...
[136:39.99]Itchy eye.
[136:43.05]Mic is not muted.
[136:43.87]I can see it over on the other screen.
[136:47.37]I can see it, man.
[136:49.71]You can't fool me.
[136:51.11]I'm the gingerbread man.
[136:52.03]Alright, where is it?
[136:55.07]Up there.
[136:57.57]Where is that?
[137:08.22]This is where the two Ursulas are.
[137:13.51]I'm going to try to just soul weave the two Ursulas.
[137:17.27]I don't know why I'm calling the sword soul weave, but I am.
[137:25.86]Come on.
[137:26.44]You're going to fall.
[137:27.14]I know you're going to fall.
[137:28.02]Oh, no!
[137:33.00]Thankfully, playing a sorcerer, these guys are not stupid and annoying.
[137:37.10]You don't have to have a thrust weapon to kill them.
[137:56.00]Okay.
[137:57.50]Actually, I'm almost out of Estuses.
[137:59.75]I'm almost out of them.
[138:00.75]Shit, this is not going to work.
[138:01.85]I'm not going to be able to kill both these Ursulas.
[138:15.16]Yeah.
[138:16.90]This is where we do the run tactic.
[138:18.46]It's time to sprint.
[138:22.57]Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[138:25.50]Let's go!
[138:32.99]Okay.
[138:34.89]I just want to get the item that's up here.
[138:36.25]Because it's a good one.
[138:38.43]If I remember.
[138:41.49]Flynn's Ring.
[138:42.43]Yeah, that's the one.
[138:45.24]That's the one.
[138:51.40]Okay, this is the ring that, if I'm not crazy, lower equipment load and increases attack.
[139:02.01]I mean, I wish I had that before, but attack really doesn't matter for me at the moment.
[139:09.33]There's something else over here as well.
[139:13.73]Cleanse the bastard's curse.
[139:29.85]This is a drop.
[139:31.13]You need to be careful for the drops.
[139:53.14]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[140:00.75]I'm not going to lie.
[140:02.03]I'm going to be for real with you guys.
[140:03.47]I did not think that was going to kill me.
[140:05.90]I thought it was going to take me to like 50%.
[140:07.14]I just... I did not think that was going to kill... take me from 100% down.
[140:16.74]I thought it was going to be like 40 or 50%.
[140:18.28]I did that on my other character and I didn't die.
[140:22.10]What?
[140:22.72]What the fuck is happening?
[140:26.37]It was...
[140:28.20]Alright, uh, Tin Colin, thanks for resubbing, dude.
[140:30.98]Like, I swear to god I did that on my other character and I didn't die.
[140:41.51]I don't know.
[140:42.37]Don't ask me.
[140:45.79]But I kind of have to go back there to get those souls, so that's what I'm gonna do.
[140:54.96]Okay, that explains it.
[140:57.22]That explains it.
[140:58.82]Thank you for giving me that explain.
[141:00.52]I didn't know that.
[141:02.44]Dexterity reduces fall damage?
[141:04.70]Since when?
[141:06.39]Is that new in Dark Souls 3?
[141:07.77]Was that in the other games?
[141:08.89]I don't remember that being a thing.
[141:11.07]I almost just got cream canned with that.
[141:37.50]I'm still in here?
[141:38.20]No, I'm going down.
[141:40.20]You know what?
[141:41.06]I'm going to kill the thing that's down here.
[141:42.58]Might as well.
[141:45.26]You didn't know that either?
[141:52.79]No, that's a bad idea.
[141:54.57]This thing could instantly kill me.
[141:58.61]Dex does not reduce fall damage.
[142:00.71]What?
[142:01.45]I thought it did.
[142:05.77]Hold on.
[142:06.03]Let me send this down so I can... Reduces damage taken while falling.
[142:20.60]Yeah, it does.
[142:21.27]There it is.
[142:26.91]Written in the words of the Dark Souls text.
[142:37.84]Yeah, that must be new.
[142:39.34]If everyone in the chat is saying that that's not true, then it must be a new thing.
[142:45.28]Huh.
[142:47.34]That's why I didn't die before.
[142:49.46]That's so odd.
[142:50.20]That's very weird.
[142:58.09]When am I coming back to North Carolina?
[142:59.51]I don't know.
[143:02.05]My sister used to live down there, but she's since moved, so that's why I haven't been going down anymore.
[143:13.91]Game doesn't suck now.
[143:16.53]Don't worry game sucks I actually might be able to kill the Ursula's now.
[143:31.42]I'm actually pretty confident that I will kill the Ursula's oh
[143:48.63]Fast moving enemies like this are hard to hit with Soul Arrow.
[143:55.71]They just move around everywhere.
[143:56.81]These guys really give me trouble on this character.
[144:05.24]I have to hit them with my right hand.
[144:09.18]That's not cool.
[144:10.94]Do I have to kill these stupid things again?
[144:14.34]Will they not get aggroed if I just walk in the room?
[144:16.34]Don't they get aggroed from the chest?
[144:21.73]I'm not sure.
[144:22.23]I don't think so.
[144:24.43]I think I have to open the chest for them to realize that a person came in.
[144:32.80]But I... Too bad I have that stupid dart on.
[144:36.88]I'd love to not be using it.
[144:44.57]Alright, I don't... I don't know why it took off lock on.
[144:49.27]Why is it coming off?
[144:53.53]It's still coming off.
[144:55.29]Like... God, that is so annoying.
[145:00.14]And now I can't even lock on to her in the back.
[145:10.44]Fuck!
[145:11.86]What?!
[145:14.03]What the f- W-W-W-What?!
[145:18.45]This- This- This is- I can't even- Can't-
[145:31.53]Why?
[145:32.47]Why does that happen?
[145:35.01]Be careful.
[145:36.02]Be careful.
[145:36.66]That was so stupid.
[145:38.64]What even?
[145:40.50]That was fucking stupid.
[145:42.56]And y'all know it.
[145:43.60]We all know it.
[145:44.78]Everybody knows it.
[145:47.06]That was not fair.
[145:49.79]Not fucking fair.
[145:57.77]I was not even close.
[146:00.31]And I got hit through the fucking wall.
[146:03.16]Say goodbye to 6,000 souls.
[146:06.52]They are gone.
[146:07.68]They're gone forever.
[146:11.30]Somebody swung through a solid object and killed me.
[146:23.02]Life's not fair.
[146:27.10]Well, I'm gonna go see if I can fight this dude.
[146:29.39]What a joke.
[146:38.93]What a joke.
[146:41.17]Come on, I'm playing a sorcerer.
[146:42.73]You're gonna make me... Life's hard enough already.
[146:50.86]This is gonna be hard.
[147:09.91]I thought he was gonna dash.
[147:17.47]See, this is what I was talking about.
[147:19.19]It's hard to find any real opportunity to cast a spell.
[147:29.50]Yeah, I didn't... No.
[147:32.54]This is the... This is like the wall, I guess.
[147:34.80]Where we're gonna have to figure out if I can actually do this.
[147:47.61]This is gonna be very, very, very hard.
[147:50.21]I wanna take this off the bar.
[147:58.41]This might be one of those situations where I just have to fight the guy.
[148:01.25]You know what I mean?
[148:06.30]Run behind him and, uh... Don't aggro him, try to get by him.
[148:09.44]Yeah, but I mean, this is like a test, though.
[148:11.24]This is a real test.
[148:13.58]To see if I have enough casting time to fight enemies like that.
[148:17.39]Otherwise, the remainder of the playthrough... Can you imagine some of the enemies later on?
[148:22.47]If it's going to be hard for me to cast a spell at somebody?
[148:26.13]I'm going to get peed on.
[148:31.09]Why don't I cast Greatsword?
[148:32.09]Because it takes like three seconds to happen.
[148:34.21]And that guy will kill you in less than one.
[148:36.03]I actually tried to do it.
[148:40.16]It was too long of a cast.
[148:49.64]I feel like there's a lot of people behind me right now.
[148:55.94]I could just shield it up.
[148:57.74]That's true.
[149:03.82]Thank God they're blocked.
[149:08.22]Let's try that.
[149:11.79]What's a good, like, shield I can throw on?
[149:13.63]This one's leather.
[149:15.73]I don't have enough strength to put half of these on.
[149:19.74]This is the only one I can put on.
[149:22.90]I wonder if that's gonna help at all.
[149:24.84]I mean, not really.
[149:26.34]No, this is like a piece of skin.
[149:33.39]The one thing I could try to do is try to get two heavy soul arrows immediately.
[149:38.90]And then switch to the rapier and just fight the rest of them.
[149:45.32]I'm going to try that.
[149:50.87]Going double heavy soul arrow, and then I have to fight them with the rapier.
[149:53.93]Oh, hold on.
[150:08.63]Hmm, that might not work.
[150:13.29]This is so scary.
[150:21.58]Oh, god.
[150:22.10]Oh.
[150:39.47]Bye.
[150:39.81]It was nice playing with you.
[150:42.35]It was nice playing our badminton tournament together.
[150:47.39]There's no way I'm going to kill you on this character at this level.
[150:51.40]So, have fun.
[150:54.02]We'll talk soon.
[151:00.20]Is it amateur hour already?
[151:04.33]Oh shit, I gotta wrap around and get the bonfire.
[151:05.87]It's like right here.
[151:08.53]I just like blended in with the ground.
[151:09.75]Now here's test number two.
[151:21.52]You guys ready for test number two?
[151:24.72]Go back to what I was doing before.
[151:30.39]So this is right hand.
[151:32.15]So I want the rip here.
[151:39.10]We're back to testing.
[151:40.60]Because these guys are... These guys are insane.
[151:45.56]I wonder if they're too stupid.
[152:00.74]Not too bad.
[152:04.00]Not too bad.
[152:16.97]Alright.
[152:24.08]On your way to Farron Keep.
[152:28.78]No, not Farron Keep.
[152:29.46]What's the other place?
[152:31.94]What's that damn place?
[152:33.70]What's that goddamn place we're going to?
[152:38.56]Hello?
[152:43.26]Bada bing and then bada boom.
[152:49.32]Okay, these guys are not a problem at all.
[152:54.18]I thought I was scared about this area doing this.
[152:59.85]Why would it take it off?
[153:02.51]It doesn't seem to make sense.
[153:03.81]It's really aggravating.
[153:11.08]Oh, the Tin Man's down here too.
[153:12.14]We can fight the Tin Man.
[153:17.90]That did not hit him.
[153:20.17]Oh man!
[153:40.08]It's just, this sword is just way too slow.
[153:44.52]It takes an eternity to swing that sword.
[153:49.57]For only 160 damage, I can do 160 damage.
[153:52.09]I can do 180 damage at range by casting two soul arrows.
[153:57.79]I don't see the need of this.
[154:00.09]Soul arrow is just too good.
[154:05.15]Before these guys can even get near me, it's less mana.
[154:09.58]See, like, watch.
[154:10.78]I just casted one sword.
[154:13.24]There's your sword.
[154:15.32]There's two and a half swords.
[154:35.17]The funny thing about the death count is there are people that are probably coming in right now going, holy shit, this guy's died 168 times.
[154:54.98]He's not even at the third boss.
[154:57.94]Wow, sorcery must be really hard.
[155:03.03]Thought I could aim it over there.
[155:10.89]I jumped over it.
[155:11.85]Asshole.
[155:33.44]The Deacons, yeah, they would be great against the Deacons.
[155:37.36]I can't really think of any other situation where the sword would kind of be good.
[155:42.14]Maybe PvP.
[155:43.96]Kind of just, they think you're going to cast like a little dinky spell at them.
[156:08.34]My God, will you fucking calm down?
[156:12.90]They get in this, like, you roll the dice and they do that same spam jump move, like, three times in a row.
[156:21.29]Can I get a different roll, please?
[156:23.15]Can you do anything else?
[156:24.61]God.
[156:25.57]God.
[156:26.01]It's all great, so it's easy to dodge in PvP.
[156:37.34]Yeah, it probably is, now that I think about it.
[156:38.98]You're probably right.
[156:40.18]You can just see it coming from a mile away and just dodge right through it.
[156:43.86]And then just annihilate the person.
[156:50.44]Where's the Tin Man?
[156:51.06]The Tin Man's down.
[156:51.76]I'm going to be in a lot of trouble.
[156:53.49]I'm going to die.
[156:54.97]But you know, sometimes you've got to die.
[156:56.63]I'm probably going to die to the Tin Man.
[156:57.77]I'm going to try it, though.
[157:01.33]I'm going to try fighting the Tin Man.
[157:02.89]Let's hope I just don't get hit.
[157:07.17]Actually, if I can keep him stun-locked down here, we might be able to kill the Tin Man without much trouble.
[157:28.95]Oh, please.
[157:32.31]Ooh!
[157:33.37]That was lucky.
[157:33.95]I got him.
[157:40.75]Got his butcher's knife.
[157:48.09]If I remember, this is where they throw a lot of weapons at you.
[157:50.09]There's like three weapons in this tiny little area.
[158:06.32]How significant is...
[158:08.96]the cast speed for dexterity.
[158:11.78]I saw somebody talking about it again.
[158:14.20]Is it that significant that I should put points into it?
[158:16.74]I feel like it's one of those things that's you put a bunch of points into it and it's really like a quarter of a second or something or not even.
[158:25.71]I don't know, but this is going to be bad.
[158:29.13]Because I'm going to be out of ammo.
[158:36.68]Dead?
[158:37.14]Thank god.
[158:50.34]Dex Caspi to change his dinky.
[158:52.76]Use the ring.
[158:54.09]Yeah.
[158:59.91]We'll see.
[159:04.85]I'm going to reload the area.
[159:06.73]Level up once.
[159:08.03]Because I don't have enough.
[159:09.00]I can't really do anything.
[159:18.14]I want to level up.
[159:19.64]Once.
[159:26.25]I also want to go back and get the ash.
[159:33.07]Oh, Star, you're not even modded anymore.
[159:35.71]I, like, banned you, like, three times.
[159:54.24]What is this person writing?
[159:56.29]Sup, Yerma, you fucking old man, huh?
[159:58.41]Fucking old man.
[159:59.39]How's that shave cream working out, old man?
[160:02.47]What the hell are you talking about?
[160:16.49]So, Dex.
[160:18.13]I wish there was a casting speed thing.
[160:28.50]I mean, I have a lot of attunement.
[160:32.12]I don't need more attunement right now.
[160:39.47]What else do you have?
[160:46.85]Oh, you've got a miracle!
[160:54.62]Can I get this thing to S scaling?
[160:56.82]What does it bring it to?
[160:58.90]No, it just keeps it at A. Who cares then?
[161:05.07]I also feel like I should upgrade the rapier, but I don't want to use it.
[161:18.37]I'm not a big fan of it.
[161:30.91]Where was it?
[161:40.78]Is it here or here?
[161:41.40]Where does the guy throw the spears?
[161:48.80]I want the ash.
[161:50.48]I ran by it and I said I was going to come back.
[162:01.14]When you fall through a hole in the ground past the crucifixion board's bonfire castle, there's a sage ring in the water.
[162:06.92]Yeah, I think I got that before.
[162:09.17]There's a lot of caster rings, from what I understand.
[162:13.09]Where is the spear-throwing dude?
[162:15.41]I forget what that area is right now for some reason.
[162:21.96]Back to the bridge.
[162:42.82]I help anytime.
[162:52.10]Is it right over here?
[162:56.30]I don't remember.
[162:57.12]I don't remember.
[162:58.12]Well, he dropped fucking rubbish, Mike.
[163:07.06]Yeah, it's right here.
[163:14.79]Alright, help me.
[163:15.43]Kill them.
[163:16.03]You're my friend now.
[163:17.01]You're supposed to help.
[163:29.72]This is what I came here for.
[163:30.90]Mm-hmm.
[163:36.61]Mm-mm-mm.
[163:37.71]Anything else over here?
[163:40.69]I didn't get because I was running around.
[163:42.43]Apparently something over here.
[163:43.99]No, this is a dead body.
[163:47.68]Alright, I can leave.
[163:50.34]That guy just exploded.
[163:53.36]He's gone.
[163:54.72]That guy disappeared.
[163:56.78]That guy... What is going on?
[163:58.68]What am I going to hit by?
[164:13.32]That was really weird.
[164:14.12]I think the guy was underground hitting me.
[164:22.67]Game sucks.
[164:27.19]Should I just try the tree boss?
[164:28.55]I mean, he's right here.
[164:29.55]I mean, I... No, I'm just gonna... Whatever.
[164:33.48]I'm gonna just go to the tree boss.
[164:36.48]I came here for the bone ash, but... I don't think I'm gonna be able to do this right now.
[164:40.42]I'm gonna have to come back here later.
[164:44.19]Because how am I going to be able to aim at any of the things on his body?
[164:47.97]There's no free aim with casting.
[164:49.53]I have to use my rapier.
[164:50.67]Alright, here we go.
[165:02.60]This is going to be so much fun.
[165:10.75]Maybe the sword will work here.
[165:14.32]It's the only thing I can really think of.
[165:23.74]It's going to take so long to swing it, though.
[165:27.30]Oh, my God.
[165:27.76]I made such a mistake.
[165:29.31]I shouldn't have done this.
[165:30.13]Can you please kill these guys?
[165:32.23]Will they kill me?
[165:32.95]94 damage.
[165:38.51]That is not a lot of damage.
[165:46.56]My soul arrow would've just stabbed me.
[165:58.21]That was so stupid.
[166:00.41]I'm gonna get ya!
[166:05.64]This is gonna have to be a rapier.
[166:19.14]Just gonna have to get him the old-fashioned way.
[166:23.44]With my shitty rapier.
[166:32.91]That one was kind of odd to hit, so I'm glad I got that one first.
[166:46.33]And the one on his back...
[167:01.18]Come here.
[167:03.15]Do something.
[167:03.69]Roll over.
[167:04.89]Figured maybe it might be worth a shot.
[167:26.80]Come on.
[167:28.20]Come on.
[167:33.35]Let me see that.
[167:34.23]Roll that beautiful bean footage.
[167:39.53]Somebody just got sniped.
[167:48.99]Shit.
[167:51.17]Where's the other one?
[167:54.75]On his foot?
[167:57.95]Where's the other one?
[168:00.15]On his elbow, right?
[168:01.09]He kind of needs to get up and fall down.
[168:07.76]There's one on his leg.
[168:09.74]Underneath.
[168:10.60]Alright.
[168:10.84]I wonder, can I just, like, pick it off of here?
[168:21.97]Maybe.
[168:24.53]Yeah, I can.
[168:33.70]Ooh, nice and easy there.
[168:38.83]Out of flasks.
[168:39.65]That was a bad aim.
[168:44.62]Bad aim.
[168:52.88]Last one.
[168:53.54]Right in his stomach.
[169:04.33]Not a place I want to be.
[169:11.51]I'm going to go this way.
[169:13.85]Get away from me.
[169:14.69]I don't want to be in the corner.
[169:16.23]I just want to aim and shoot you in the stomach.
[169:35.48]Isn't there another one on his elbow?
[169:40.84]Could just do that, too.
[169:49.48]No, shoot him forward.
[169:50.42]Like that.
[169:51.96]I think I'm gonna.
[170:11.06]I think I'm gonna.
[170:22.64]He's a little far away, he's gonna stand up.
[170:24.46]I didn't even see that one.
[170:35.73]I didn't even know he had that.
[170:49.83]Alright, I'm gonna go for it.
[170:50.89]Here we go.
[170:52.55]Moment of truth.
[170:53.37]I'm just gonna go for the stab.
[170:55.03]Right in his gut.
[170:59.72]Come on, spin around.
[171:04.50]Oh, dear!
[171:07.30]Oh, dear!
[171:09.90]Oh, no!
[171:13.73]No!
[171:14.49]I just... He did the spin two times in a row.
[171:16.81]God damn it.
[171:21.59]Why did my chat crash?
[171:26.85]What is going on?
[171:27.39]My browser crashed, too.
[171:29.83]Oh, that sucks.
[171:30.69]I just got too impatient.
[171:33.25]I just got really impatient because I was sick of just standing around.
[171:37.05]It's very doable.
[171:38.00]I could have done that easily.
[171:39.54]Fuck me.
[171:42.10]Did, like, all of Twitch crash?
[171:44.96]Am I even streaming right now?
[171:49.74]I think I am.
[171:59.90]Yeah, I can't get the chat to come back.
[172:02.34]Everything, like, crashed on me.
[172:04.90]That was dumb.
[172:07.60]Yeah, I just, I played it patient the whole time.
[172:09.30]I just got so sick of, ah, these, like, 15-minute boss fights.
[172:17.17]Ugh.
[172:17.99]Okay, I can see the chat again.
[172:22.07]Okay.
[172:28.29]Oh, I had it too.
[172:29.27]I had it.
[172:29.79]I just... Oh, you just get so bored sometimes.
[172:33.01]You just want to end it.
[172:34.25]And that's not the way you can play this game.
[172:42.50]Okay, did I get hit by one of his moves?
[172:45.66]The whole time until the very end?
[172:52.34]I don't think he hit me with any moves until the very end.
[172:54.46]I got like right on the hand.
[172:56.24]That's got too greedy.
[173:03.99]I'm gonna talk to you again.
[173:09.78]Wait, wait, wait.
[173:11.18]What am I doing down here?
[173:20.92]Oh, boy.
[173:21.36]I'm actually not gonna fight the Greatwood right now.
[173:25.96]I'm gonna come back again.
[173:34.44]I'm gonna go back later.
[173:38.30]This fucking guy's serious.
[173:40.61]Like, you dudes, for real?
[173:43.57]You're gonna keep me, like, locked in like that?
[173:45.21]I kinda just wanna go over this way.
[174:01.12]For reasons unknown.
[174:08.90]Especially for like a caster like this is the worst class for me to be playing because You you have to be so patient.
[174:17.85]I'm the most impatient person on Earth If you do not take every single thing so slowly and seriously with the caster You're gonna get fucking dumped on
[174:51.54]I missed two or three subs, too.
[174:52.82]I'll check that in a minute.
[175:04.09]Camel.
[175:05.07]Camel case.
[175:05.57]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[175:17.46]Okay, I don't want that guy to wrap around.
[175:41.71]That damage is pretty good.
[175:47.72]I'm almost out of mana.
[175:50.20]This guy's gonna be behind me in two seconds.
[175:51.82]Oh no, didn't I kill him?
[175:52.68]Isn't that what I specifically did that for?
[176:12.83]God, who's down here?
[176:13.85]I know there's one.
[176:15.73]Where did you go?
[176:22.69]The four on this bridge might not be that big of a deal.
[176:24.85]If I can just stay and cast.
[176:32.79]Lost the lock on again.
[176:34.15]Over his fucking head.
[176:46.82]Come on.
[176:48.16]Just stab him.
[176:59.62]Yeah, next time I don't have to buy a hundred arrows to fight that dragon.
[177:02.02]You're right.
[177:02.44]Alright, I think I'll see you.
[177:14.75]That was my plan all along.
[177:17.49]There is another one here, no?
[177:18.51]Okay.
[177:34.52]I think I'm just going to run by you guys.
[177:38.81]This is not going to be easy.
[177:41.49]There's a bonfire right up here anyways.
[177:56.82]No, I won't.
[178:00.20]That's a lie.
[178:01.02]Just kidding.
[178:03.87]Uh-huh, got ya.
[178:04.59]Just kidding.
[178:09.05]Help me!
[178:09.83]Help me!
[178:10.15]What are you two doing?
[178:11.55]You see the two fucking Wizard of Oz gargoyles?
[178:13.62]Please do something.
[178:23.94]Die!
[178:28.12]Alright, they both jumped.
[178:29.00]He jumped off.
[178:29.56]Good.
[178:41.73]Hi guys, thanks for the help.
[178:43.19]I don't want the pickaxe.
[178:44.65]You want me to use a pickaxe on this guy?
[179:20.29]Come on, where's the hit detection?
[179:21.47]Where's the hit detection?
[179:22.89]Come on, Bill Gates.
[179:25.19]What was that?
[179:29.37]Come on, Bill Gates.
[179:31.37]You promised me Windows 7 was gonna be way better.
[179:34.65]Did you see that?
[179:35.21]I didn't even hit that guy, Bill.
[179:46.44]Come on, Bill Gates.
[180:07.35]Mana.
[180:10.21]Alright, this is where the giant crab is.
[180:19.72]Crystal Sage is over there, that way.
[180:25.72]Crystal Sage is gonna be a pain in the ass too, isn't she?
[180:29.28]Crystal Sage might be, like, where I can't play this game anymore.
[180:34.67]I'm gonna have to do like all melee.
[180:43.65]Are these guys fighting?
[181:04.26]Quack.
[181:05.18]Quack.
[181:07.40]Quack quack.
[181:32.09]People are wondering where... Wow, hold on a second.
[181:34.59]Let me use this item where I should.
[181:37.39]That was cool.
[181:39.87]Nice.
[181:40.83]Alright, there it is.
[181:42.21]That's the one reason why I have this item on.
[181:45.21]When there's 200 enemies next to each other.
[181:49.49]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[181:53.09]Thanks, ElioBot.
[181:55.13]Welcome back.
[181:58.11]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[182:00.69]Thank you.
[182:11.59]Stab him in his back.
[182:13.27]In his back.
[182:13.71]In his back.
[182:14.61]In his back.
[182:16.50]Like this guy.
[182:17.08]Watch.
[182:18.04]See?
[182:18.22]That's what I wanted.
[182:29.76]What else is over here?
[182:30.86]Anything?
[182:31.20]Anything?
[182:31.52]Anything?
[182:31.82]Anything?
[182:34.06]I don't think so.
[182:35.68]Except for this guy.
[182:57.88]That was way funnier than I thought it was gonna be.
[183:12.32]One.
[183:12.42]Two.
[183:12.64]One.
[183:13.10]Two.
[183:27.71]I'm glad you're stuck back there.
[183:28.91]Because you would be a huge pain in the ass.
[183:33.59]Not anymore.
[183:46.73]Sorcerer.
[183:54.53]The sorcerer.
[183:55.97]Speaking of sorcerers, isn't there a sorcerer in here?
[183:58.73]In this building?
[184:01.27]You know what?
[184:01.69]I didn't get it.
[184:03.11]Oh my god, I'm dead.
[184:05.42]I'm dead.
[184:05.80]I just got comboed and I couldn't dodge.
[184:11.20]I tried to go in for a backstab and couldn't move after I tried to do it.
[184:20.42]I'm going to put on some different armor.
[184:32.68]Kind of just getting annihilated.
[184:34.32]I like how Star is talking all this shit.
[184:49.35]Didn't he, like, restart the game, like, six times?
[184:52.45]He didn't stick with anything, guys.
[184:54.51]He wanted to find the one broken thing that he could play with.
[184:58.11]So, he didn't stick to his guns.
[185:00.81]He said he was gonna do certain things, and he didn't do them.
[185:04.69]I'm sticking with it!
[185:07.77]Who can you trust?
[185:10.43]The guy that restarts the game, like, seven times?
[185:13.11]To find the perfect thing?
[185:14.91]Or the guy that sticks with his fucking guns, you know what I'm saying?
[185:18.68]Who do you stick with?
[185:22.08]God doesn't even stick to his guns.
[185:23.78]Can you trust him?
[185:32.25]I'm sticking to my guns!
[185:34.75]You know, some people want to find the easy way.
[185:37.67]Some people stick to their guns.
[185:39.43]And that's me.
[185:50.80]I want my souls.
[186:01.82]That's all I want.
[186:02.46]I actually want a PvP.
[186:06.69]I'm getting, like, a PvP itch.
[186:07.97]I want to, like, play.
[186:08.73]And we can do, like, a password and we can all play together.
[186:10.81]That'd be fun.
[186:16.75]My guy looks like a fucking idiot, by the way.
[186:24.93]That guy is still here.
[186:28.03]There he is.
[186:30.19]Locked in a corner.
[186:31.23]Get me the backstab.
[186:34.79]What is... I got it, apparently.
[186:37.15]I was told we would see potentially a bow run through his star.
[186:48.16]He threw that in the trash can within like 20 minutes.
[186:52.01]Huh.
[186:52.55]He's gotta find the thing that is really, really super strong and powerful for him to run as fast as he can through the game.
[186:58.21]What happened?
[187:00.59]Where's the bow?
[187:01.91]Where's the bow, Star?
[187:03.06]What happened to the bow build?
[187:18.05]Where's the sorcerer?
[187:25.71]What happened to the bows?
[187:28.61]You turned around.
[187:29.21]You decided to not do it.
[187:30.05]You can play that game.
[187:44.52]What the fuck?
[187:45.40]He's still alive.
[187:48.00]He's still alive.
[187:51.84]He's healing too, isn't he?
[187:53.56]Come on, stick your head out.
[188:04.26]I want a PvP.
[188:05.50]I'm actually glad that just happened.
[188:09.09]Did you kill an arrow with a hundred arrows?
[188:10.97]Didn't think so.
[188:12.13]Did you kill an arrow with a hundred arrows?
[188:17.59]Yeah, I want a PvP.
[188:19.41]I had the itch.
[188:20.03]I want to do that now.
[188:24.59]I am glad it happened.
[188:25.35]That means I can play... That means I can PvP now.
[188:30.49]I had to have an excuse.
[188:34.33]We're gonna make a password.
[188:47.82]That's what we're gonna do.
[188:50.08]No, I'm not Pv- I wanna PvP like the viewers, not you.
[188:54.97]Hey.
[188:55.93]Take a fucking hike.
[189:04.72]Alright, password.
[189:05.42]The password's gonna be... Uh... No, um... No, I was gonna do the sandstorm.
[189:29.89]Can't do sandstorm?
[189:33.01]Okay, sandstore.
[189:38.28]The cross-region matchmaking is going to be... Should I do on or off?
[189:43.41]I probably should just keep it off for now.
[189:44.87]Because we might get... Unfortunately, if you're in EU... It might not be good.
[189:54.33]We might just be standing around lagging.
[189:58.13]Line restricted.
[189:59.01]Summer sign visibility.
[190:00.25]I don't know what that means.
[190:05.36]But where's, like, the actual cracked orb?
[190:08.00]Do you have to use that?
[190:12.46]Oh, fine.
[190:12.90]I guess I'll turn it on.
[190:13.56]So that's cross, okay.
[190:14.42]Whatever.
[190:17.20]Sandstorm.
[190:22.62]I'll go on the... this character here.
[190:33.23]Matchmaking's not that bad.
[190:35.14]Okay.
[190:41.10]Red... Do I even have... Do I have the red soapstone?
[190:43.06]I have cracked red orb.
[190:44.84]Where do you get the soapstone?
[190:45.80]I don't think I even got it anywhere.
[190:53.07]Somebody sell it?
[190:59.63]Oh, shit.
[191:01.73]I killed everybody.
[191:07.79]I legit killed everyone here.
[191:09.95]Nobody can sell me anything.
[191:14.97]Wait, I can go back to Lothric and get it.
[191:18.07]Listen to me, son.
[191:20.53]I'm your dad.
[191:22.95]Destroy him!
[191:26.40]Whoa!
[191:27.72]Jellyton thanks for stopping, dude.
[191:30.14]Where is it?
[191:31.42]Where is the orb?
[191:33.06]I have the key.
[191:33.84]It's down in Lothric, right?
[191:34.90]Somewhere.
[191:45.19]I could summon people who put down their soapstones.
[191:47.27]That probably makes more sense.
[191:50.15]Let's see if that works.
[191:54.38]We're going to go to... What's a good PvP area?
[192:02.68]You just want to go to the arena?
[192:03.98]Isn't there a specific place where everybody goes?
[192:10.11]Where is it?
[192:23.63]Does anybody know a good arena spot?
[192:32.03]Tower on the wall.
[192:33.39]Okay.
[192:38.17]Area after Pontiff.
[192:39.13]Yeah, there's a spot.
[192:40.09]It's like a big open area, isn't there?
[192:44.81]Alright, we'll go there.
[192:45.43]I'm just going to go get the... It's all the way down from here.
[192:49.39]I have the key.
[192:50.07]I just never came back.
[192:52.45]I never came back to do this.
[192:53.95]I don't care.
[193:11.45]I don't care about any of you guys.
[193:21.16]Really?
[193:21.94]Come on, man.
[193:25.28]Are you serious?
[193:26.20]Hey, thanks for the halberd.
[193:33.03]Oh, a guy.
[193:33.59]This is actually kind of cool.
[193:36.19]This guy just drops it.
[193:40.62]Well, you're just dead.
[193:42.16]Okay, bye.
[193:44.02]Red eye orb.
[193:54.20]Invade other worlds at will.
[193:57.02]So now what happens if I do that?
[194:00.64]Will I invade somebody with the password?
[194:07.16]Password matching.
[194:08.26]Edit to match with players using the same password.
[194:19.66]I'm just going to try it.
[194:20.34]Those of you guys that have that password, let's see what happens.
[194:22.30]I'm just curious.
[194:22.82]I'm using it.
[194:24.60]Invade another world.
[194:25.38]Yep, here we go.
[194:28.88]Searching for another world.
[194:36.23]It's looking.
[194:39.69]Do they have to be in this area?
[194:40.89]So you probably have to be in the Tower of Lothric, right?
[194:45.47]Whoa, what is going on with this chat?
[194:47.25]What is people freaking out?
[194:59.57]Okay, I'm going to another world.
[195:02.69]Apparently.
[195:10.00]Am I in one?
[195:15.38]What's going on?
[195:15.94]Listen to me, son.
[195:17.88]I'm your dad.
[195:20.30]Destroy him!
[195:24.36]Avenger 75.
[195:26.40]Welcome.
[195:26.70]Thanks, dude.
[195:27.88]Welcome.
[195:31.24]It said I was going into a new world, but is it seamless?
[195:34.72]Invasion.
[195:35.70]Okay.
[195:36.04]Alright, we're going to pick a spot.
[195:41.68]That place is probably after Pontiff.
[195:44.98]It's probably best.
[195:50.44]I'm going to go back.
[195:57.25]Head to Pontiff Sullivan.
[196:02.97]And search.
[196:04.35]I guess I'm still going.
[196:05.97]I guess I could turn it off or something.
[196:08.08]Out of my way.
[196:18.52]Battleborn?
[196:19.24]Battleborn is in beta right now, isn't it?
[196:34.92]I'm invading another world.
[196:38.02]Am I?
[196:38.26]Oh shit, I am going.
[196:41.24]Oh shit.
[196:42.58]Okay, apparently I'm... Here we go.
[196:44.66]I'm invading somebody.
[196:45.68]I wonder if this is a person with my... Ember's Tyrant.
[197:05.69]Yeah, the soapstone is a much better idea.
[197:14.53]I can hear him.
[197:20.63]Is he down here?
[197:24.39]Where are you?
[197:30.22]Just like stream snipe me if you're watching the stream.
[197:33.84]That doesn't work with passwords?
[197:35.02]Okay.
[197:37.87]Well, where's this guy?
[197:39.39]I want to show him a funny thing.
[197:40.37]I heard him, too.
[197:49.65]Become a statue.
[197:50.53]Can I do that here?
[197:51.19]Or do I want to just still be red?
[197:57.59]I'm literally just jumping off the edge.
[197:59.22]I have no idea where this guy is.
[198:07.59]Just take my fucking medicine.
[198:09.27]Where is it?
[198:14.29]Where's like the thing to disassociate yourself with the world?
[198:32.50]Show him your face.
[198:39.24]Travel.
[198:41.12]Where is it?
[198:54.74]Remember the man who left you be in the archives?
[198:56.56]That's true.
[198:57.20]He did.
[199:00.45]He left me alone.
[199:01.17]Alright, so this is at this spot right here.
[199:14.59]Or is it the other side?
[199:23.86]I think it's the other side.
[199:31.69]So there should be a bunch of soap stones down here.
[199:33.51]This is going to be fun.
[199:41.37]This is going to be so fun.
[199:43.02]I can't wait to do this.
[199:48.62]Okay.
[199:49.70]So I'm assuming that these are all... These are people with the same password, right?
[199:55.40]Alright, we'll start with Quinton.
[199:58.55]QuintonXD.
[200:03.31]Where are my emotes?
[200:12.23]Alright, Quinton.
[200:15.43]You and me.
[200:18.88]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[200:23.49]Hey, Basmic.
[200:25.59]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[200:26.79]Thanks for subbing again.
[200:36.70]Where is he?
[200:40.02]Come on.
[200:41.00]Come on.
[200:42.46]Come on.
[200:44.40]Come on.
[200:50.72]I'm waiting.
[200:57.79]Hmm.
[200:59.95]Sand store.
[201:01.49]There he is.
[201:04.23]Hey, this way.
[201:07.27]Hey, you.
[201:13.88]Yeah.
[201:14.32]You're gonna go up.
[201:14.94]You're gonna reach for the fucking sky.
[201:19.90]Yeah.
[201:21.61]Alright, let's do it.
[201:22.73]Here we go.
[201:27.37]Wow, that's a cool weapon.
[201:28.68]Oh, I'm rolling off.
[201:38.14]Oh, nice hit.
[201:39.00]Nice hit.
[201:43.46]This dude's like a battle mage.
[201:55.62]Hmm damn it Nice work Damn it trying to get the parry
[202:22.75]Oh, he's got more weapons.
[202:24.03]This guy's like a treasure chest.
[202:50.41]Oh!
[202:51.67]Good fight, man.
[202:52.59]Good job.
[202:55.13]Good work.
[203:00.35]That was fun.
[203:03.42]That guy had a lot of tricks up his sleeve.
[203:08.96]I wish I had, like, more weapons to play with.
[203:11.60]I want to do more weapons.
[203:13.64]Alright, uh... A... Lameo.
[203:18.34]Oh my god, look at this guy's face.
[203:20.15]Alright, you get summoned because your guy's face looks like it's melting.
[203:36.36]Do an earlier bonfire so people can play.
[203:39.88]Does it level you all out?
[203:43.00]Because the only problem I see with that is if I go there and you're like level 10, I will like kill you in one hit.
[203:54.44]I'm not sure how PvP like scales different people, but I don't know.
[204:01.69]I want to get a good look at this guy's face.
[204:04.11]Here comes the green goblin.
[204:08.39]I just want to see what he looks like.
[204:10.31]What was that?
[204:10.87]Oh, no.
[204:11.71]Okay, that's a mask.
[204:12.67]I thought that was his face.
[204:13.53]Well, let me do my thing.
[204:19.50]My emotes are fucking terrible.
[204:22.90]Like, that's a nice weapon.
[204:30.25]Ooh.
[205:04.22]This guy's gonna get me.
[205:05.91]I love that weapon.
[205:06.79]That weapon's fucking awesome.
[205:07.87]I was trying to run.
[205:20.91]Oh, that was sick.
[205:23.30]Damn.
[205:25.00]Dude, that guy, that was a perfect... That was awesome.
[205:35.05]That was so awesome.
[205:49.78]Let's do it again.
[205:51.68]Uh, eeny, meeny, miny, moe, eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
[206:00.54]Oh, get, get Lamaeod.
[206:05.69]Hey, good job, Voido.
[206:07.79]What is that halberd?
[206:08.87]Where'd you get that thing?
[206:11.75]That thing's crazy looking.
[206:12.65]Let me look up my... I gotta get better emotes.
[206:29.70]Uh, and... Gee, right there, you're gonna get buried!
[206:37.96]You see that ground right there?
[206:39.18]You're going in that ground.
[206:41.02]You understand?
[206:44.20]Oh dear.
[206:46.10]This looks like it's going to be fun.
[206:51.88]I love playing against the ski characters.
[206:53.74]It's the best.
[206:54.31]Because you don't know who's going to do moves.
[206:56.93]You don't know what moves the civilian is doing.
[207:00.61]Oh boy.
[207:06.92]Is he just hitting me?
[207:08.26]I am, I guess I am.
[207:09.02]I don't even know what the... That's the best way to fight people, man, is you can just walk up and you don't even know when they're swinging.
[207:42.24]Pull off a parry.
[207:45.28]That would have been pretty... That would be cool if I could have... What does this one mean?
[207:50.93]What does the golden one mean?
[207:53.31]Okay, like, I'm going to summon this one because this one was golden.
[208:07.58]What else do I have?
[208:08.94]It might be fun to try something else.
[208:10.04]Is this the halberd the guy was using?
[208:14.00]That was me.
[208:14.92]Lime dough.
[208:23.58]Alright, let's toast to you.
[208:28.97]Ah, cheers.
[208:30.65]A toast.
[208:37.55]Alright, here we go.
[208:46.51]This dude's throwing bombs.
[208:54.08]Oh, boy.
[208:55.20]Oh, I had a chance.
[209:20.94]Yeah, that was a lot of swings.
[209:38.64]I forget that there are weapons that can do that.
[209:54.20]I probably could have parried one of those, but I kind of forget that I can do that.
[209:57.32]Let's go with this one.
[209:59.42]Alright, Benji.
[210:05.75]Oh, it didn't work.
[210:06.41]Alright, Ray.
[210:18.60]Did it work?
[210:28.09]Did it work?
[210:35.77]Yes, it did.
[210:43.60]Good game.
[210:44.00]I was really anxious.
[210:44.70]Didn't want to lose two.
[210:47.18]It's all in good fun, man.
[210:53.31]Hey!
[210:55.05]Hey!
[211:01.37]What the fuck was that?
[211:02.83]He has like a slug that talks?
[211:21.71]Oof.
[211:31.47]Oh, good dodge.
[211:42.68]Oh, that was close.
[211:54.30]Ah, someone would have to catch him.
[212:00.33]Ooh, what's that turn?
[212:01.25]That's an interesting move.
[212:16.35]Ooh.
[212:19.71]Oh, shit!
[212:20.35]This is close!
[212:26.27]Ooh, nice job!
[212:27.47]Damn.
[212:33.05]That was a nice game.
[212:38.80]That move is cool.
[212:40.16]Something I didn't think about in PvP is... Your... The weapon arts.
[212:49.49]Can be pretty cool.
[212:55.95]Uh, that was Benji.
[212:56.61]I just fought Benji.
[212:58.75]Oh no, I didn't.
[212:59.27]I'll try Benji again.
[213:00.53]Benji didn't go through.
[213:12.22]Yeah, there's sort of a, when you do a PvP duel, there's an unwritten rule out of courtesy to not pot.
[213:26.28]I just heard him.
[213:32.84]I just heard it again.
[213:33.54]This guy's different looking.
[213:38.18]Why you don't... What are you doing?
[213:45.54]Are you seriously going to fight me with the treasure head?
[213:47.76]What the fuck is this shit?
[214:01.73]Oh, fuck.
[214:02.23]Fall it off.
[214:10.53]Ooh, that poke.
[214:31.45]Both had the same idea.
[214:40.08]Alright, nice.
[214:40.88]Nice fight.
[214:41.86]The treasure head guy.
[214:49.89]See, that thing was ticking damage on him, by the way.
[214:54.49]That was fucking funny.
[215:07.16]Why do you guys have this game?
[215:08.46]I didn't think there'd be this many signs.
[215:18.26]I want to go on my other character and do this.
[215:22.06]I mean, my big axe guy.
[215:38.76]The cool thing about the katana is you can parry with this, although I'm not comfortable ever trying.
[215:50.19]It's still cool to be able to do the dash.
[215:53.64]Because you can do the... I need to kind of chill out while my thing recharges.
[215:59.90]Alright, again, now... Okay, first it was Treasure Guy, now it's Mushroom Head.
[216:07.20]These guys are with these crazy hats.
[216:12.94]This guy's like a Glue Man.
[216:14.34]He's like a superhero.
[216:26.56]Ooh, that did a lot of damage to me.
[216:33.25]That thing hurts.
[217:24.81]What is that movies doing oh shit
[217:33.03]Good game.
[217:35.63]That's like, that like, weird like, fake out that like, bang!
[217:40.36]Is that, is that like a buff?
[217:41.32]A self-buff or something?
[217:44.42]That dude hit me with... Do you look at my chunk of my health?
[217:48.04]That's crazy.
[217:54.41]It was a good game, though.
[217:57.11]Uh, this one's purple.
[217:58.71]So we're gonna, we're gonna summon Purple Dergy.
[218:08.94]Try Sorcerer PvP.
[218:15.62]I don't know.
[218:15.92]I would get my ass kicked.
[218:24.25]I will say it's cool to see everybody's Halloween costumes.
[218:34.77]I love that so much.
[218:42.82]I thought I could get a parry there.
[218:46.87]Fire guy.
[218:47.41]I always fall down here.
[218:57.52]We should just get down here in the beginning.
[219:17.44]Ooh, nice try.
[219:18.26]Nice.
[219:19.10]That would have been fucking game over.
[219:24.89]Ooh!
[219:25.51]The turnaround!
[219:26.43]The turnaround!
[219:27.39]Nice game.
[219:39.44]Hello!
[219:46.44]He got me with the backswing on that one.
[219:47.80]That was good.
[219:57.01]Oh.
[219:58.73]Oh no, where are all my... Where are all the signs?
[220:01.97]Do I have to be... I think I have to have the ember on, right?
[220:13.20]Didn't I die before?
[220:13.94]I died in PvP before.
[220:26.16]There we go.
[220:28.36]Uh, we'll do another sun dude.
[220:30.28]Pachi.
[220:31.50]Hello, Pachi.
[220:31.98]Nope, okay.
[220:32.60]Uh, Nick.
[220:33.10]Frozen crazy tuna.
[220:34.42]Thanks for the reset.
[220:56.93]Yeah, I'm in a covenant.
[220:58.71]Or I was.
[221:01.91]The watchdogs of Farron.
[221:12.69]Oh, I did want to go back and look at the other subs.
[221:16.21]This guy's like a knight.
[221:21.01]Interesting knight costume he got on here.
[221:28.99]I'm going down.
[221:29.79]I'm going down.
[221:33.49]He almost just hit me with that, too.
[221:36.63]Oh, you got a katana.
[221:37.59]We both have katanas.
[221:39.33]Oh, a katana fight.
[221:42.91]Shit.
[221:43.65]I thought I was going to get one of those.
[221:58.78]Oh boy, I kind of screwed myself here.
[222:14.98]Ah, nice job.
[222:16.40]I went for too many parries.
[222:22.48]Good fight.
[222:43.34]Who are you?
[222:44.34]Rynwald.
[222:45.14]Come on in, Rynwald.
[222:49.18]Use your Estus.
[222:51.26]That's a... That's a big no-no.
[223:01.17]Alright, we'll do... I'll do three more.
[223:03.43]And then I'm gonna come back.
[223:04.33]We'll do Axe.
[223:05.01]I'll be my Axe guy.
[223:23.99]Wait, did I actually just summon Star?
[223:29.49]Is that who this is?
[223:31.17]He has a different name?
[223:32.25]I don't know what his character names are.
[223:35.34]How am I supposed to know what his character names are?
[223:40.58]What's this?
[223:41.10]He's got lightning on his hand now?
[223:43.50]Alright, fine.
[223:44.20]You wanted to do it.
[223:44.88]This is what you wanted to do.
[223:45.89]Let's go.
[224:02.27]What the hell was that?
[224:08.28]You just throw in, like, lightning bolts?
[224:25.35]Shit!
[224:25.53]I didn't want to swing a third time!
[224:43.87]Did he just Estus?
[224:44.69]No.
[224:46.13]He, uh... He just did a bunch of moves.
[224:55.92]I didn't even know what those even were.
[224:57.68]Thought I was gonna, like, sword fight a guy.
[225:09.11]I just fought a Dark Souls boss.
[225:11.05]I had to, like, learn what his moves were.
[225:24.13]Oh, wait, yeah, he did use a flask, didn't he?
[225:26.34]Yeah, he did.
[225:28.14]I'm sorry if you... That's fine.
[225:29.98]I mean, hey, guys, guys, he did win, but he did drink a flask, but, guys, he did win, right?
[225:34.56]That's all that matters.
[225:38.57]Guy drank a flask.
[225:39.31]I mean, he did win.
[225:40.29]I give him, you know, I give him the credit.
[225:41.83]I give him credit.
[225:42.47]He drank a flask, but, you know, he did win.
[225:52.32]This guy's crazy looking.
[225:54.08]He's like a skeleton man.
[225:57.40]You can get to full health if you want, or do you... Oh, maybe that's part of the weapon.
[226:03.02]Oh, dear.
[226:07.30]Whoa!
[226:08.20]That was weird.
[226:08.68]That was weird, too.
[226:15.99]That was weird 2.0.
[226:50.00]Oh shit, I hit it.
[226:51.48]I didn't think I'd get it.
[226:52.50]I didn't think I got it.
[226:53.16]There we go.
[227:01.32]No, it didn't do it.
[227:02.26]It didn't do it.
[227:02.86]It didn't do it.
[227:24.75]Nice, good bait.
[227:40.28]Good fight.
[227:44.46]Good fight, good fight, good fight.
[227:51.51]Alright, one more.
[227:52.15]And I'm going to go on the axe guy.
[228:02.13]That was a good katana fight.
[228:04.91]Memory.
[228:05.65]Look at this dude.
[228:08.74]Oh, what?
[228:11.72]I already did that, I think.
[228:13.50]Who else?
[228:16.26]I want to get somebody that didn't play.
[228:17.52]Alright, that guy.
[228:22.30]Breezy.
[228:25.00]Breezy.
[228:35.61]You got me.
[228:36.01]You got me with the kid.
[228:46.95]Where are you?
[228:51.60]I want to do the hello thing.
[228:52.61]That seems fun.
[228:53.19]Okay, he's got a parry dagger.
[228:58.45]Hi!
[229:01.29]Beware of the parry dagger.
[229:03.29]He's using the farrowing greatsword.
[229:04.63]Ooh, I got caught.
[229:17.66]Oh shit, that was not who I thought it was.
[229:29.64]That move is crazy.
[229:30.86]He just, like, he slides around.
[229:32.08]Whoa, boy!
[229:42.27]That thing is so fucking cool!
[229:43.71]Ooh, is that it?
[229:56.24]Is he dead?
[229:57.80]Oh!
[229:59.77]He's dead.
[230:01.45]That was a tough one.
[230:06.36]That one was hard.
[230:12.06]I was going for like the big hole in one there.
[230:14.47]That was a really good fight.
[230:16.85]That sword is cool.
[230:18.81]You can like kind of put it down and ski around people.
[230:20.87]That's awesome.
[230:24.96]I want to go on the other character.
[230:26.93]Let me make sure I got everybody that was over here.
[230:31.05]Memory was the only guy, I think, that didn't get to play over here.
[230:34.39]I'll try Memory again.
[230:37.81]I'll give you another go, dude.
[230:57.66]Third hit in that combo is ridiculous.
[231:01.62]That excites me.
[231:02.34]That makes me happy that there's that much cool things like PvP stuff in the game.
[231:06.51]Because I always thought that playing through the game, a lot of the weapon arts seem very gimmicky.
[231:14.85]And I was like, when am I ever going to need to use something like this?
[231:17.57]And I thought, wait a minute.
[231:18.84]PvP, you can really mess around with people.
[231:23.86]So that's cool.
[231:25.89]Alright, memory.
[231:27.03]You also have a katana.
[231:29.41]The two katanas.
[231:30.01]You have two katanas?
[231:31.71]Is that what's going on?
[231:34.37]Are you dual welding?
[231:35.17]I thought I was going to get you with that one.
[231:53.91]Hmm, I can't bait it out, can I?
[232:14.90]Yeah, he's got dual wield, huh?
[232:34.38]No!
[232:34.78]Oh, thank God I got it.
[232:36.52]Thank God I actually hit the right bumper.
[232:38.01]I almost didn't get the visceral there.
[233:00.93]Easy easy Almost nice nice job Oh Wow Wow Wow, I forgot you could do that.
[233:20.52]I forgot you could backstab
[233:25.91]I forgot that was a thing you could do.
[233:27.74]I didn't know it even worked in PvP.
[233:30.22]Damn.
[233:32.10]That was fucking awesome.
[233:42.50]I was wondering, I like turned, my body like turned around.
[233:44.72]That was crazy.
[233:45.38]I'm just like, hey, watch out over there.
[233:49.46]Uh...
[233:51.85]A couple more.
[233:52.59]I'm, like, really getting into the swing of things.
[233:54.03]This is really, like, fun for me.
[233:55.48]Yeah, that was a dance.
[234:00.78]I, uh, I guess I gotta keep that in mind.
[234:04.44]I was more worried about parries than I was of backstabs.
[234:08.86]Now, question, if you're in the chat.
[234:13.82]Did you, is that, do you have a weapon art on the other sword to be able to dash around?
[234:20.28]Because that would be pretty cool.
[234:21.80]If that's what you were doing.
[234:30.59]There he is.
[234:34.11]He just chewed on something.
[234:36.59]He's... Okay, now he's a statue.
[234:39.43]Oh, shit.
[234:39.81]Where did he go?
[234:42.55]I don't know what happened to him.
[234:44.73]He's somewhere over here.
[234:45.45]That's like the last time I saw him.
[234:46.41]He was over there.
[234:57.32]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[234:58.66]We can't even hit each other.
[234:59.64]This is some lag.
[235:06.65]For a second, that went in his body, and I didn't think it hurt him.
[235:13.61]Whoa.
[235:22.93]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[235:26.62]Alright, I guess I killed him.
[235:30.39]Good fight.
[235:30.99]Good fight.
[235:31.63]Good fight.
[235:44.02]Holy shit, look at this guy.
[235:46.34]Oh, he just has the mushroom thing on.
[235:48.18]I just saw the... I saw the...
[235:52.71]What's my soul level?
[235:54.21]I don't think that's in this game.
[235:55.95]Didn't they take that out?
[235:59.71]I believe they got rid of soul level.
[236:04.71]Or soul memory, whatever the hell it is.
[236:14.21]Okay, Nick.
[236:19.63]Here comes another potato head.
[236:20.97]Or cauliflower, dude.
[236:31.87]Let's-a go.
[236:36.25]Alright, we'll go down here.
[236:37.17]I actually like going down here.
[236:40.95]Oh, you have the same thing as the other guy.
[236:43.19]Is it the same guy?
[236:59.82]Oh, I was going for it.
[237:16.91]Good fight.
[237:19.41]Good fight, Broccoli Man.
[237:22.27]So this is the same guy.
[237:22.97]His name is Nick?
[237:23.91]I thought his name was something else.
[237:43.36]Wait, somebody said I'm level 87?
[237:44.32]Yeah, so?
[237:46.82]So what?
[237:49.55]I mean, I beat the game with this character.
[237:52.13]I don't, I mean... I beat the game... Like, I don't know, two days ago?
[238:10.38]Oh shit, I Estuses.
[238:12.22]Oh, get rid of this guy, he just did an Estus.
[238:18.51]Forlorn, isn't that the name of an actual NPC in this game?
[238:27.70]Let's do it.
[238:35.10]Ooh, that was some reach.
[239:03.23]Ah, damn it.
[239:04.25]I was too busy trying to get the parry.
[239:08.67]He was swinging all over the place.
[239:10.90]He was going a one and a two and a three.
[239:12.78]I was trying to get it.
[239:14.52]Good fight, man.
[239:15.12]Good job.
[239:20.34]Bring on the woodcutter.
[239:21.27]Is that one of Star's characters?
[239:37.52]Love.
[239:43.42]Yeah, good job.
[239:44.94]Good game.
[239:47.21]Good work.
[239:50.59]Let's look at some of these other things I have.
[240:06.54]I'm going to give this a try.
[240:12.54]What does the weapon art with this thing?
[240:13.61]I don't know.
[240:17.51]I think it's like a spin move.
[240:24.43]Yeah, it's like a spin.
[240:25.66]Let's try it.
[240:26.02]I'll give it a go.
[240:28.82]Hey!
[240:29.26]You got two interesting weapons.
[240:35.34]What are...
[240:37.51]I thought she was shooting a spell at me.
[240:44.57]You don't ever expect this!
[240:49.79]What the fuck?
[240:56.49]What the fuck was that?
[241:06.60]We can both do that move.
[241:21.55]I'll wait for you.
[241:47.88]This thing is actually kind of fun.
[241:49.10]We both hit each other.
[242:20.37]We're both trying to do the same thing.
[242:39.04]Getting smoky!
[242:49.27]Shit.
[242:52.67]Ah!
[242:52.85]Good job.
[242:53.53]Nice job.
[242:56.44]You caught my bullshit.
[242:57.56]I was going to try to get you with the bright stab.
[243:13.46]That was a good fight.
[243:18.99]I'm going to put on different clothes now, too.
[243:34.02]Let's go.
[243:36.22]Let's go.
[243:36.62]I'm ready.
[243:37.89]Oh, fuck you.
[243:51.76]You're messing with the fat guy now.
[243:54.86]The turtle man.
[244:17.57]I'm going with the blacksmith hammer.
[244:22.13]Hold on.
[244:30.38]What?
[244:30.94]Oh, I don't have the... Okay.
[244:36.62]I'm going blacksmith hammer.
[244:44.21]I'm not built for this at all.
[244:46.74]But I'm gonna do it.
[244:49.28]It's a Tardimus.
[244:55.02]Where is he?
[244:56.48]Did it not work?
[245:02.17]That was a good fight.
[245:05.63]So then what does this do?
[245:07.13]I think this is the, yeah, better poise and damage reduced.
[245:19.04]Look at my tiny arms.
[245:20.00]I have these little baby arms.
[245:23.38]And this huge stomach.
[245:39.88]Let's do it.
[245:41.10]Let's do it.
[245:42.27]Let's go.
[245:42.91]Let's go.
[245:43.47]Let's go.
[245:45.91]Alright.

[246:26.62]Guy's just like... It's so much armor on, what the heck?
[246:37.33]It should work.
[246:40.97]It should block all damage.
[246:47.07]You gotta admit though, if I had hit him with that big overhand... It would have been fun.
[246:58.58]Let's go back to reality here.
[247:00.40]Alright.
[247:13.76]I'll do... Go back to my... This thing.
[247:20.19]This thing was fun.
[247:27.76]Real close one.
[247:31.20]Shannar.
[247:38.03]Oh, this move is kind of deceptive.
[247:39.57]It's fun to do.
[247:41.23]Whoa, no!
[247:42.19]Here it comes overhead.
[247:51.74]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun!

[248:34.81]Oh, I didn't get it.
[248:36.09]I didn't get the R1.
[248:36.73]He dodged out of it.
[248:50.79]Oh, oh, oh!
[248:56.19]Shit, I thought I was going to get it.
[249:01.29]This dude is fucked up looking.
[249:02.66]Is this even a person?
[249:17.73]Well played.
[249:25.74]Let's go back to Katana.
[249:31.80]Let's get this guy.
[249:34.42]Can't summon him.
[249:39.67]Okay, this guy now has an upside down head.
[249:46.58]I read chat, I mean I'm when you PvP and it's hard to look over.
[249:51.58]I don't want to just get killed The Dragonstone
[250:20.16]Okay, this is a clown.
[250:22.14]Hold on a second.
[250:22.98]I want to get... No, I'm not fighting you.
[250:27.02]I wanted to get a look at you.
[250:28.06]I want to see.
[250:30.69]I want to see.
[250:35.33]What the fuck is this?
[250:39.95]He's wearing clown pants and a statue.
[250:43.71]This is ridiculous.
[250:47.75]That is so awesome.
[250:50.93]Where do you get the clown costume?
[250:52.29]Alright, let's do it.
[251:13.52]Alright, we'll make our way to the middle.
[251:26.95]That's been Whoa oh my goodness Wow Holy shit.
[251:43.08]I Thought it was like a spear move.
[251:44.96]I thought it was coming in like I'm gonna spear you know it turns into like a giant whirlwind oh
[252:04.78]Alright, dorp.
[252:10.78]Yeah, then he, like, took a dump in the woods.
[252:27.60]Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.
[252:37.88]Thought it was a good idea to kill everyone in the shrine.
[252:39.74]Well, I could just go to New Game Plus, couldn't I?
[252:42.60]Or would that just take me out of being able to... Yeah, I guess that would ruin everything.
[252:58.90]Hey, how are you?
[253:00.67]Watch this!
[253:05.75]Yeah, I drank an Estus.
[253:10.43]Why is it like demon Lazarus?

[253:44.18]Oh, I am just, I'm, holy shit, I was just caught.
[253:47.17]I couldn't even move.
[254:14.34]Oh, what the hell was that?
[254:15.95]At first I thought he was doing like a mine.
[254:50.87]Damn, this guy's really good at dodging.
[255:08.79]Oh, no!
[255:09.59]I thought I hit it.
[255:10.47]I thought I got it.
[255:11.67]I thought I got it.
[255:13.05]I didn't get it.
[255:15.70]Damn it.
[255:18.21]I really thought I hit that one, too.
[255:20.26]Shit.
[255:20.86]Oh, good game.
[255:21.32]Nice fight.
[255:46.66]Help me.
[256:12.68]PVP, I just heard somebody say hey.
[256:15.32]Oh Jesus, I was like looking at chat.
[256:17.94]Hi.
[256:21.20]I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you, that's a big mistake.
[256:28.20]I'm kidding.
[256:37.83]Oh boy.
[256:51.98]Oh, greedy.
[256:53.87]Wow.
[256:59.27]That was weird.
[257:10.94]Apparently I still got it.
[257:25.43]Wow, he looked at his health.
[257:28.37]Whoa, what the fuck was that?
[257:29.31]What was that move?
[257:29.87]What was that?
[257:30.25]He was about to like explode.
[257:31.27]Good game.
[257:51.16]Did you see that?
[257:51.90]He crunched up like a little ball.
[257:53.40]I thought he was going to start rolling at me like Blanka.
[258:01.00]That's a good fight, though.
[258:01.98]That spear is really effective.
[258:09.76]Alright, this is different.
[258:20.96]All the pork won't eat itself in North Carolina.
[258:24.68]North Carolina.
[258:26.52]I'll be back someday.
[258:42.50]Where are you?
[258:45.02]Where are you?
[258:47.32]You're different.
[258:50.28]You have... The Wolverine Claws.
[258:56.75]Okay, cool.
[258:58.81]I don't know what the weapon art for that is, but I'm sure we'll find out, right?
[259:02.09]Here we go.
[259:09.50]Oh, it's the... Okay.
[259:10.54]He's gonna try to get behind me.
[259:33.29]Ooh, sneaky.
[259:37.61]That was really delayed.
[259:38.79]Yeah, this is very delayed.
[260:03.53]Cool moveset, though.
[260:07.23]That's a really cool set.
[260:08.47]You just look cool.
[260:10.97]You look like a TV show character.
[260:13.35]Good fight.
[260:13.69]I feel like that could be in an anime.
[260:19.68]You have an anime character.
[260:25.78]Anybody else?
[260:28.14]I tried this guy already, but it didn't work.
[260:29.56]I guess I'll try it again.
[260:39.96]What was that last parry?
[260:42.44]It's called probably 200 ping for both of us.
[260:52.98]You want to see my stats?
[260:53.82]Yes, sure.
[261:10.49]What would I do as the... What would you do as the first president of the United States?
[261:16.29]What would I do first as the president?
[261:18.01]Write myself a big old check.
[261:24.07]And then resign.
[261:29.89]Where's this guy?
[261:32.63]Said he was here.
[261:33.13]What?
[261:38.28]Did he just get hurt over here?
[261:42.67]Hold on a second.
[261:45.33]Where is he?
[261:45.99]Is he fighting monsters?
[261:57.16]Alright.
[262:00.08]Okay.
[262:05.44]Alright.
[262:07.44]I guess that guy is over there fighting something.
[262:09.48]Oh, there he is.
[262:17.93]That's a weird... That's like a World of Warcraft weapon.
[262:22.57]Did you get that from Molten Core?
[262:24.25]Heh.
[262:24.87]Alright, let's do it.
[262:49.52]Big stick.
[263:18.10]Cool weapon.
[263:22.57]That's a cool weapon.
[263:24.09]Good fight, dude.
[263:25.17]Good fight.
[263:28.71]Chug.
[263:34.86]Let's see.
[263:36.26]I think I might change areas now.
[263:37.66]I'm seeing the same names.
[263:39.62]I'll go with this guy one more time.
[263:41.10]And then I'm gonna go on my other character.
[263:44.20]And we'll do it in an earlier zone.
[263:50.09]Hold on, death count?
[263:50.79]Are you guys adding?
[263:51.93]Don't add death count to, uh... Oh, no, no, okay.
[263:55.43]I was gonna say, wait, what?
[263:58.59]Okay, this guy died in PvP.
[263:59.85]Add it to the death count.
[264:02.51]Hey.
[264:04.91]Hey!
[264:11.45]Let's do it.
[264:12.99]You backstabbed me last time.
[264:15.91]I gotta let it happen again.
[264:30.49]Katana fight.
[264:31.13]Katana fight.
[264:35.49]Oh, she got it off first.
[264:55.46]Whoa, it happened twice.
[264:56.30]That was weird.
[265:12.88]No.
[265:14.02]Whoa.
[265:26.46]Damn.
[265:33.12]He's trying to get behind me.
[265:51.17]Ah, shit.
[265:53.19]Good job.
[266:16.62]I'm so afraid to swing.
[266:25.72]Ooh, that was close.
[266:26.46]Okay, I'm out of juice.
[266:44.05]You want that backstab bad, don't ya?
[266:47.07]Don't ya?
[266:51.37]Oh, Jesus.
[266:52.85]Lag, lag, lag, lag, lag, lag, lag.
[266:56.00]No.
[266:57.36]Good fight.
[267:07.17]Good duel.
[267:08.05]Good duel.
[267:18.52]Alright.
[267:19.50]And that's going to wrap it up for this one.
[267:21.02]Wait, there's one out here.
[267:23.87]Oh, no.
[267:24.09]I don't want to do it.
[267:25.67]I don't want to do it.
[267:26.13]I want to fight like the other character.
[267:30.45]Let me get on the axe guy.
[267:31.73]He's a low level, so... I'm going to do it right on the steps of Lothric.
[267:57.61]Yeah, Axe Guy really is just Axe Guy.
[268:00.43]He just has an axe.
[268:01.43]That's it.
[268:02.69]He's going to be pretty boring.
[268:08.41]Oh, where is he?
[268:08.93]Haha.
[268:10.79]This actually is Oogie Boogie from Nightmare Before Christmas, by the way.
[268:16.45]I made that joke earlier tonight, but he really is Oogie Boogie.
[268:23.78]There he is.
[268:27.40]I said he was axe guy, but I currently have this on.
[268:31.73]I'm going to foot of the high wall.
[268:33.93]Oh, no.
[268:34.19]The high wall of Lothric.
[268:36.29]High wall of Lothric is where we're doing it.
[268:49.50]This is a pretty okay fight area.
[268:51.96]It's small, but not horrible.
[268:55.89]Okay.
[268:59.20]I have... Matchmaking is on.
[269:02.54]So in this area here is where we're going to do it.
[269:08.16]I'm going to get my ass kicked.
[269:11.05]I have a couple of different tools.
[269:19.43]I'll try this tool first.
[269:25.41]Star.
[269:25.87]Actually star.
[269:26.60]Star.
[269:29.42]This is my off-stream character.
[269:32.08]This is the character that I'm playing not on-stream.
[269:37.80]This is my private character.
[269:40.69]Level 20 characters might not even have red soapstones.
[269:48.23]This guy's level 27.
[269:50.55]I see one right here.
[270:06.29]Password is the same.
[270:06.99]I'm going to have to play it really safe with this guy, though.
[270:22.06]I'm going to be very, very... Well, this guy's got a big two-hander, too.
[270:34.69]Let's do it.
[270:40.63]Whoa, lightning move.
[270:45.37]That just barely touched me.
[270:51.84]He's just trying to kick me.
[270:52.94]Ugh!
[270:57.68]Ugh!
[271:07.92]He's gotta go for like the baseball swing.
[271:26.77]Oh, it still hit me.
[271:37.81]I love how your character is not as fat as mine.
[271:49.44]Good fight.
[271:56.35]Now, if I fight against a character that has like a dagger and speed, I'm going to get eaten alive.
[272:02.20]Let's see.
[272:06.48]I see a name I don't recognize.
[272:07.84]Take it easy, schmuck.
[272:14.65]Thanks for coming out.
[272:16.85]It's funny to say that that's like a term of endearment to you.
[272:19.51]I'll see you later, schmuck.
[272:22.26]It's like, oh yeah, take it easy.
[272:26.39]I'm going to take him to Flavortown.
[272:27.79]I just want to crush somebody's head.
[272:42.24]Grab your dex builds, boys.
[272:45.22]Really.
[272:52.41]Hey, speaking of dex builds, I see two little blades.
[272:54.83]Alright, here we go.
[272:57.01]Fat versus skinny, the ultimate battle.
[272:59.61]Who actually is the better body type?
[273:02.51]Fat or skinny?
[273:03.35]Oh, whoa, hold on.
[273:04.85]Hold on.
[273:06.87]Hold on.
[273:07.69]That's the big cartoon hammer.
[273:09.29]You tricked me.
[273:19.01]Wow, what is going on here?
[273:22.02]Don't do it.
[273:23.06]Don't do it Gonna crush you I'm gonna crush your fucking skull Alright, you wanna play that game we can play that game I
[273:53.40]See, I can change weapons too.
[273:59.96]What is this guy doing?
[274:01.98]What is going on with you?
[274:03.70]What is going on with you?
[274:04.60]I just want to punch you in the face.
[274:16.57]It's like a big fat guy trying to swat a fly.
[274:18.51]Get me out of here, you.
[274:20.90]I'm going to kill you.
[274:26.09]Get away.
[274:27.51]Pesky fly.
[274:28.27]20 damage, what?
[274:31.86]Alright, I've had just about enough of this.
[274:50.42]God.
[275:01.72]Now I have the power.
[275:06.35]Is it like a grab?
[275:07.23]Shit.
[275:14.75]I actually still hurt him.
[275:30.20]You're gonna waste all your stamina!
[275:32.18]I told you!
[275:32.74]Alright, back to reality.
[275:47.63]Good fight.
[275:54.06]Darkrunner Mirren.
[275:56.94]Let's go.
[276:14.49]This mace is really cool.
[276:15.35]This is from... This is named Vort.
[276:18.58]The dog thing.
[276:20.24]The dog guy.
[276:27.44]Where's he at?
[276:28.92]Where'd you go?
[276:37.30]Hmm.
[276:39.22]There you are.
[276:54.21]Any second now.
[276:57.40]I'll switch weapons.
[276:58.36]I'll use this thing.
[277:04.76]Make it nice and sharp.
[277:07.48]Make it nice and sharp.
[277:16.79]Where's this guy at?
[277:19.05]Oh, there you are.
[277:23.38]We have to, like, walk together.
[277:25.44]Yeah, we're fucking total badasses.
[277:32.94]Alright.
[277:35.13]Are we ready?
[277:37.51]We're ready.
[277:37.87]I'm going for a baseball swing.
[278:15.49]One more, one more good one.
[278:24.55]This thing is so heavy.
[278:29.46]Oh, oh, he's alive!
[278:30.58]He's alive!
[278:31.58]You gotta go for the punch.
[278:38.78]Sometimes you gotta go for the punch when they have two HP.
[278:43.32]Good fight.
[278:53.62]I need to get some health.
[279:00.48]Oathbreaker Ninja.
[279:02.26]Oathbreaker Nina.
[279:07.95]Maybe I should put on a sickle.
[279:13.79]I think I'm going to go fat guy with a sickle.
[279:16.50]I'm going to two-hand it.
[279:21.42]See, I can fucking move.
[279:30.23]Fat dude with a sickle.
[279:34.03]I actually found this.
[279:35.69]I wanted this item.
[279:38.17]Like, 20-20 hindsight, I wish I had picked this up on my Dex character.
[279:41.21]Because this thing is super fast.
[279:45.29]And it looks really cool.
[279:46.15]I wish I had this on the other character.
[279:53.97]Nice fight.
[279:54.37]Didn't expect the punch.
[279:57.55]It's hard to expect the punch.
[280:00.83]Alright, this dude is different.
[280:01.89]You got two burning claw hands.
[280:04.49]Fist weapons.
[280:18.70]I like skating around.
[280:25.46]What the hell was I doing?
[280:36.64]Oh!
[280:36.82]Uh-oh!
[280:49.86]Uh-oh!
[280:54.16]Am I only doing like 15 damage a hit here?
[281:10.63]Ah, that was it.
[281:11.13]That was it.
[281:11.57]I was behind him.
[281:12.67]Whoa.
[281:45.81]There it is!
[281:46.41]Buh-bye!
[281:48.34]Was I doing more damage with my fists?
[281:53.48]Good game.
[281:54.24]Good fight.
[282:05.43]Let me see.
[282:05.83]52?
[282:06.95]I guess.
[282:09.23]I don't know.
[282:11.39]We'll go back to Cleave, man.
[282:13.07]This was working out pretty well.
[282:16.33]Um, multi-trip.
[282:18.85]Anybody else?
[282:20.57]I'm going to refresh it just out of curiosity.
[282:27.07]Alright, well.
[282:28.81]Multi-trip it is.
[282:29.43]Make sure I pick up my souls.
[282:47.04]Stream is going late.
[282:48.56]Yeah.
[282:49.40]I'm going to... A couple more times with this and I'm probably going to call it.
[282:53.68]Because I do need to continue the work on that video.
[282:57.36]But I like Dark Souls 3.
[282:58.98]It's fun.
[282:59.50]I like to play it.
[283:02.68]We'll do two more after this one.
[283:04.22]And I'm going to call it here.
[283:09.41]Oh, timed out.
[283:11.65]I tried everyone.
[283:23.46]Is that the guy with the two shields?
[283:24.84]No.
[283:26.30]That's too bad.
[283:36.49]Did I pretend to beat Archdragon's Peak?
[283:38.65]I didn't even know what that is.
[283:42.37]I don't even know what that is.
[283:44.51]I'm assuming it's a different area that I didn't get to.
[283:46.79]It's an optional area or something.
[284:02.29]Alright.
[284:04.61]Let's go.
[284:05.03]I don't think he expected me to do that.
[284:14.68]Although he's kind of comboing me.
[284:29.30]Oh, boy.
[284:31.22]I was still fighting that one.
[284:34.96]Insta-killed.
[284:46.71]Love, Nick, or Kargoth.
[284:53.71]Okay, Kargoth.
[284:56.74]You're up.
[285:01.54]My character would make a pretty neat Roadhog skin.
[285:03.30]Yeah, it would.
[285:05.84]You're right.
[285:06.10]It actually really would.
[285:08.50]But yes, this character is modeled after Oogie Boogie from Nightmare Before Christmas.
[285:16.09]I saw that I could put the hood on and I had to find a big fat suit to put on and I got one.
[285:32.55]I feel like this guy's going to screw something up here.
[285:34.61]Just die.
[285:35.49]I'm going to get rid of a pesky guy.
[285:41.66]Hi!
[285:53.49]Oh, I almost double-tapped you.
[286:04.96]What a weird item.
[286:05.72]I think it's so odd.
[286:18.05]He kills me with the knife.
[286:33.04]I see a lot of people with that weapon.
[286:39.75]Oh, I couldn't summon this guy.
[286:49.82]That seems to be quite a popular weapon.
[287:01.09]The knife kill.
[287:03.81]The dart kill.
[287:08.16]What platform?
[287:09.42]This is PC.
[287:11.64]Or if you meant literally, this is the first bonfire at Lothric, High Wall Lothric.
[287:28.08]Oh no, it didn't work.
[287:31.90]Somebody I haven't seen, somebody I haven't seen.
[287:33.60]Oh, this guy.
[287:34.52]I'll try this guy again.
[287:47.89]Summon three guys.
[287:50.35]I don't think I can.
[287:51.87]I don't have the item required, right?
[287:55.75]And I killed everybody in the town.
[287:57.13]Except not on this character.
[287:59.51]That'll be the grand finale.
[288:00.65]I'll summon like four guys and we'll just have like a total battle royale.
[288:08.05]I'll do that after this.
[288:09.03]It's the finger item, right?
[288:10.08]Let's go back to this thing.
[288:24.87]Where is he?
[288:27.13]Where are you?
[288:38.52]For a second I was confused.
[288:51.55]I like knew he was here.
[288:53.72]Look at this guy.
[288:54.78]What the fuck are you doing?
[288:56.02]What are you doing?
[289:00.14]You're gonna shield me?
[289:05.22]Why are you the opera singer from the Looney Tunes?
[289:09.80]Get away from me.
[289:10.88]Get away from me.
[289:18.26]Ooh.
[289:35.17]I'm gonna get killed by a shield person.
[289:48.81]Again!
[289:49.21]Again!
[289:49.97]I'm going for a baseball swing!
[290:00.51]Oh, you didn't think I was gonna do that, did you?
[290:02.29]You didn't think I was gonna do that, did you?
[290:14.78]Where?
[290:15.54]Oh, shit.
[290:19.88]Oh, no.
[290:20.18]Where did he go?
[290:20.76]This is funny.
[290:29.64]We both just do the same exact thing.
[290:33.76]Come on, I want to end it like this.
[290:54.40]Come on.
[290:57.28]No, shit!
[290:57.94]Wrong button.
[290:59.81]Come here.
[291:04.83]Take his fucking head off.
[291:09.12]That was awesome.
[291:13.50]That character seems so fun.
[291:18.38]What a hilarious thing to do in this game.
[291:23.35]Alright, so I'm gonna, let me just go back.
[291:25.63]I'm gonna go buy the item.
[291:27.47]And we're gonna have just like a three person battle royale here.
[291:31.10]If she even has it, I'm not sure if she even has the item yet.
[291:48.51]Do you have it?
[291:49.21]You do.
[291:50.25]Should only be used with the greatest of caution.
[291:52.93]Used to strengthen the connection to other worlds, allowing the summoning of a third phantom, but also a second dark spirit.
[292:01.68]Like, I don't... I kind of don't get it.
[292:06.33]So, do I have to summon somebody, then use this, or use this before I summon anybody?
[292:22.95]That was a sick backstage battle royale.
[292:36.08]Alright, so three... Okay, so if we summon three just random friends, that means we can get invaded, right?
[292:52.00]So, I can use it as many times as I want.
[292:55.57]It's not like a ring or anything.
[292:56.87]And it has unlimited uses.
[292:58.45]Okay.
[293:00.01]Or at least it seems to, right?
[293:04.78]Unlimited use.
[293:05.66]Alright, I'm using it.
[293:08.56]Okay.
[293:09.08]So, let's summon... Who didn't get, like, a chance?
[293:11.66]Alright, you weren't in here yet.
[293:14.52]Oh, damn it.
[293:15.04]Sorry.
[293:15.28]Sorry.
[293:16.96]What about you?
[293:18.51]You've been in here a couple times.
[293:20.77]I haven't seen you, so I'm going to summon you.
[293:25.85]And... Barbie... I don't think I saw this guy.
[293:32.14]Did this mess up?
[293:34.74]I don't think you got in.
[293:37.40]Alright, we've got three dudes.
[293:46.44]It's a 3v3.
[293:48.30]Battle Royale.
[293:57.33]3v3.
[293:57.47]3v3v3v.
[294:00.13]You got the cartoon hammer.
[294:01.11]I like it.
[294:03.99]Now, are we all hostile?
[294:06.59]Or is it these two guys versus me?
[294:12.36]Where's the soapstone?
[294:13.98]Do I have it?
[294:17.52]I don't think I have it.
[294:27.55]I'm waiting for the other guy.
[294:31.03]Oh, there he is.
[294:31.45]Okay, so can these two guys fight?
[294:34.98]Or no?
[294:35.96]It has to be two of my friends.
[294:37.14]Alright, well, come with me.
[294:39.30]We're going to go on a journey together.
[294:44.90]Follow me.
[294:45.37]Let's go.
[294:54.75]I wanted to come up to the dragon.
[294:56.31]You have to be embered to summon friends.
[294:57.77]Oh, okay.
[294:59.79]Alright, so... You guys ready?
[295:03.55]Let's do this thing.
[295:04.29]Hold on, there's a guy shooting arrows.
[295:11.91]Okay.
[295:15.29]Let the games begin.
[295:16.28]There's a guy behind me.
[295:22.38]This is gonna be awkward.
[295:33.25]This is so dumb.
[295:40.68]Oh, God!
[295:41.12]Oh, no!
[295:55.47]Oh, I tried to bait him out!
[295:57.79]Oh!
[296:05.15]Alright, this one down.
[296:07.40]Oh god, he just whack-a-mole'd me.
[296:10.40]I'm alive.
[296:11.34]I'm alive.
[296:12.60]It didn't kill me.
[296:14.12]Oh shit.
[296:22.54]Damn it!
[296:23.38]Oh, good game, good game, good game.
[296:30.99]That is funny.
[296:35.78]Mmm, crunchy.
[296:41.82]Alright, guys.
[296:42.90]I think that's going to wrap it up for tonight.
[296:46.20]PvP is actually very fun.
[296:49.64]I could see myself playing that again.
[296:52.42]With different characters.
[296:53.62]That was really fun.
[296:55.50]But until next time... Until next time, guys.
[297:00.02]Goodbye?
[297:01.06]Wait, no, not yet.
[297:02.15]Hold on a second.
[297:03.59]Not yet.
[297:06.12]I need to... I want to make sure I say thank you to the people that subscribed because I missed at least two or three of them during some heated moments.
[297:20.15]Let me get to that.
[297:27.20]So, thank you to... Avenger75, JellyTon, Eliobot, CamelCase,
[297:36.50]I think I caught some of you guys, but some didn't go through.
[297:51.64]Or some did go through, but I just didn't see them because I was busy looking and intently staring at my screen.
[298:00.19]So thanks again, guys.
[298:01.45]Take care.
[298:02.03]Until next time.
[298:03.21]I probably am not going to stream tomorrow.
[298:06.47]I desperately need to get this video finished because it has been unfinished for like a week and a half.
[298:11.36]So good night.
[298:12.70]Goodbye.
[298:13.20]Good luck.
[298:14.96]And take care, guys.
