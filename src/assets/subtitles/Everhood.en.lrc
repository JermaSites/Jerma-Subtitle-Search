[00:02.93]Well, hi.
[00:04.93]What's up?
[00:06.21]How are ya?
[00:08.39]Welcome to the stream, as always.
[00:12.49]My name is Jerpa985.
[00:15.87]You already knew that, you clicked on it.
[00:18.71]Good afternoon, how are ya?
[00:25.94]Do you, what is that?
[00:27.58]Don't do anything cool while the ad is going.
[00:29.68]Oh my, you know what, that's a really good idea.
[00:35.93]That's true.
[00:38.90]I should not say anything for the first five minutes ever of any stream.
[00:43.48]That's right.
[00:43.94]Because a ton of people are coming in and getting a pre-roll.
[00:56.53]That's true.
[00:58.29]Alright, well, let's just, like, do nothing.
[01:00.37]I do nothing for five to ten minutes anyways for the first ten minutes of every stream.
[01:05.64]You're always late in the first place.
[01:06.78]You know, alright, let me ask you guys something.
[01:10.16]Maybe we should poll the community on this, because this is important.
[01:14.93]If I were to hit the live button, right?
[01:18.11]At 4 p.m.
[01:19.69]Pacific.
[01:21.87]But I just was not here for at least 10 to 20 minutes.
[01:26.76]Would you prefer that or would you prefer for me just to be ready to go?
[01:32.62]And like when the stream comes on, you know, within, within like two to three minutes that we're just going to start.
[01:37.60]What do you prefer?
[01:40.52]Would you rather just me be late or do you want the stream to turn on at four and have this screen on for like 15 to 20 minutes?
[01:48.97]Right.
[01:50.47]We want you ready to go.
[01:52.33]Rather just be late.
[01:54.79]Okay.
[01:57.39]Be light, be light.
[01:57.95]Alright, second one.
[01:58.67]Okay.
[02:00.27]Turn it on so we can... Turn it on so we can listen to the music and watch the planets.
[02:06.63]Yeah.
[02:08.19]I'm talking about Monk.
[02:09.56]That's what I mean.
[02:13.62]I was just watching your Thrillville VOD.
[02:16.58]Make it 5 to 10 instead of 20.
[02:17.78]Well, it is 5.
[02:19.16]It's 410 right now.
[02:20.92]I didn't start at 421.
[02:26.43]So we're going to play Everhood today.
[02:27.53]We're going to continue the playthrough.
[02:32.07]I don't really know that much about... Alright, so the last time I played this, I played it for like 40 minutes.
[02:38.97]And it was really... I was like half a bottle down in wine.
[02:45.60]Like I drank like half a bottle of wine.
[02:46.96]I was just playing it.
[02:47.54]I don't... I didn't really follow the story that much that well.
[02:51.70]I remember it was fun.
[02:55.71]But, and people were like, please, for the love of God, play this game again.
[02:59.08]I was like, alright.
[03:02.82]Restart the game.
[03:03.52]No!
[03:07.28]Start over?
[03:07.86]No, I mean, I played it for like, I like, I remember the gnome stuff.
[03:13.99]It was fun.
[03:14.37]I remember the guy, I remember being in like the club and the guy's like, we did like a dance battle.
[03:27.30]Why do I sound like that?
[03:28.58]Stop!
[03:30.44]What's wrong with me?
[03:34.50]Yeah, but you were drunk.
[03:37.40]So what?
[03:38.24]I started the game a little bit on the drunk side.
[03:40.61]So what?
[03:42.65]I can't continue that playthrough?
[03:44.91]It needs to be a clean slate.
[03:49.63]Well, let me ask you this.
[03:51.45]How long is this game?
[03:54.38]Is this game like a four hour experience?
[03:57.39]Is this game like a seven hour experience?
[03:59.19]How long is the game?
[04:04.93]It's like about seven hours.
[04:06.19]Okay.
[04:06.45]It's like six to seven.
[04:07.33]Alright.
[04:07.59]Well then.
[04:09.11]So then I can, I'm guaranteed to be able to finish it tonight then.
[04:12.47]Like six.
[04:12.89]Yeah.
[04:13.17]So then I've already like four.
[04:14.39]Yeah.
[04:14.79]No, no.
[04:15.05]We're not starting over.
[04:17.34]Let's go.
[04:24.84]You guys ready?
[04:27.62]I'll give, okay, here's the story so far.
[04:31.29]Laser beam dance game.
[04:33.53]They shoot laser beams at you.
[04:34.77]You have to dodge it.
[04:36.11]The music is to the music.
[04:37.13]There's a beat that plays in the background.
[04:38.93]You jump over the beat.
[04:40.37]You dodge the beat.
[04:41.71]And then you beat enemies based on dodging their musical attacks.
[04:45.71]That's pretty much it.
[04:46.51]That's all you really need.
[04:47.73]It's pretty fun.
[04:49.07]I will tell you right now.
[04:50.39]Let's get this out of the way as well.
[04:52.50]There's a flashing lights warning.
[04:55.14]I turned on this thing here.
[04:57.42]So the image sensitivity I turned on.
[05:02.60]Because I don't really like getting my face flashed and shit anyways.
[05:07.17]But just be aware.
[05:08.49]This game, if you're photosensitive, this is going to be a doozy.
[05:16.97]Anyways, I'm ready to rock and roll.
[05:19.19]Did you put up a warning?
[05:24.54]I think, does that warning stay in the corner?
[05:30.16]I don't remember.
[05:30.94]Let's see.
[05:33.22]I put it on hard?
[05:34.62]I played this on hard?
[05:39.02]What?
[05:42.55]Why did you let me do that?
[05:46.50]Why would I be on the hardest difficulty, guys?
[05:49.06]What?
[05:54.69]But we're only like 30 minutes into the game.
[05:56.79]I got into this castle.
[06:00.37]You're good at it, so don't worry.
[06:01.45]I'll be alright.
[06:01.85]I got into the castle and I'm about to do like a big castle battle.
[06:06.11]This expert as well.
[06:07.21]Yeah, I know.
[06:09.97]We tried to stop you.
[06:11.35]You insisted on it.
[06:13.34]Okay, well...
[06:15.39]You should put a warning on screen.
[06:16.81]Should I actually?
[06:17.47]Because I will if you think I should.
[06:26.17]No, yes.
[06:26.77]Yeah, I'm getting a lot of yeses.
[06:29.76]You should.
[06:31.02]Yes.
[06:31.50]Put it in the title.
[06:32.98]My title is like perfectly, carefully, comedically crafted.
[06:35.46]I don't think I want to do that.
[06:38.54]I'll put it on screen.
[06:42.68]I'll just put it like kind of in the corner.
[06:46.83]Your title sucks.
[06:48.55]Oh, yeah.
[06:53.87]I've been in a weird mood lately.
[07:05.82]How's that?
[07:06.14]Can I have it down here?
[07:13.96]Where should it go?
[07:14.52]Like up here?
[07:22.64]Is that alright?
[07:23.70]Is it okay?
[07:24.24]Put it right in the middle?
[07:25.08]I'm not gonna put it in the middle, dude.
[07:28.34]What are you talking about?
[07:34.71]Responsible Andy.
[07:38.07]I think that's okay.
[07:42.17]Yeah, I think that's alright.
[07:45.93]Put it in the stream title.
[07:47.71]My stream title is perfectly crafted.
[07:49.68]Alright.
[07:50.38]Well, alright.
[07:50.86]You guys saw the... Whatever.
[07:51.72]Fuck.
[07:52.14]You guys saw the funny joke in the stream title.
[07:54.56]Who cares about the title?
[07:55.60]I'll put it in the stream title.
[07:59.66]You guys already saw the funny stream title.
[08:01.26]Alright.
[08:02.24]And everybody laughed.
[08:03.16]And now... Alright.
[08:04.12]Here we go.
[08:05.22]Put it up here.
[08:09.31]Dude, I have this... You're required to feel the music.
[08:12.19]Flashing lights.
[08:12.95]Should I put it right here?
[08:28.69]Okay.
[08:29.15]This title has so many brackets.
[08:30.89]This is the longest title I think I've ever had.
[08:38.90]This title is too long now.
[08:40.50]Let me see.
[08:44.00]Is that better?
[08:54.72]There we go.
[08:56.16]Who cares, somebody said.
[08:57.38]I don't... Okay.
[08:58.80]When I play... People tell me, play Ace Attorney, dude.
[09:01.19]Play Ace Attorney.
[09:01.81]Ace Attorney is, like, so fucking fun.
[09:03.63]It's, like, the funnest game.
[09:04.61]You're gonna love it.
[09:05.79]That's... That's great.
[09:06.99]I tried to play it.
[09:07.77]I did... Because I always try to see if I can record a game or capture it.
[09:10.11]Make sure it doesn't look like shit, right?
[09:12.69]Um... I can't play Ace Attorney.
[09:15.98]Because every 10 seconds, the game decides to go like this.
[09:18.58]And I don't know why.
[09:19.86]It goes... Can I go?
[09:20.88]Can I go?
[09:21.96]Can I go?
[09:23.14]And it flashes a white light in your face.
[09:26.04]It happens every 10 seconds.
[09:27.38]Anyways, the key to the locked door is somewhere in the maze.
[09:33.11]I put it there.
[09:34.25]Maybe it was for the best.
[09:36.55]Okay, so I gotta find the key.
[09:41.67]Why can't anyone hear me?
[09:44.38]What?
[09:46.00]What?
[09:48.94]You were playing the game wrong.
[09:51.66]You should buy a real copy of the game.
[09:54.14]It's funny you say that, sir or madam.
[09:57.78]I actually bought every single version of the game that was available.
[10:03.35]I bought it on the iPad to see if it happened on the iPad.
[10:06.51]I got it across every platform.
[10:08.25]Steam.
[10:09.77]Everywhere.
[10:11.15]Consoles.
[10:13.18]I purchased that game probably four or five times.
[10:16.44]Because I was hoping that one of these versions did not have the flashing white light.
[10:23.19]Nope.
[10:25.99]Hi-ho-ha.
[10:27.35]Fancy seeing you here in such a spooky place.
[10:29.95]I am known as Freddy here.
[10:32.11]I've heard that this castle has a heart and a soul.
[10:35.45]I wonder what that really means.
[10:37.41]Maybe it has a secret rooms.
[10:39.92]Ooh!
[10:40.04]Ooh!
[10:53.22]Slime.
[10:55.56]Here we go.
[10:58.91]Everybody get ready.
[11:00.11]First banger of the night incoming.
[11:03.67]You ready?
[11:05.55]This is Flan.
[11:06.61]Welcome to Slime Brothers Plank Service.
[11:08.33]My name is Flan and my brother's name is Buck.
[11:12.17]It's me.
[11:13.33]We provide a plank renting service.
[11:15.27]What kind of plank are you looking for?
[11:18.47]I'm looking for a long plank.
[11:21.17]Long planks are my favorite, but sadly they are out of stock.
[11:27.22]Welcome to Sly Brothers Plank Service.
[11:29.58]My name is Muck and my brother's name is Flan.
[11:33.02]Talk to my brother if you want to rent a plank.
[11:39.00]Welcome to Sly... That's not what he said.
[11:42.08]I forgot everything about this guy.
[11:45.56]What was he?
[11:46.02]I forgot.
[11:48.65]I don't remember.
[11:49.60]I'm not kidding.
[11:50.18]I don't remember what he sounded like.
[11:51.40]I have no idea.
[11:53.42]I don't know.
[11:56.63]He was kind of like Otto on the right, but what did he sound like?
[12:01.25]I... Welcome to Slime Brothers Plank Service.
[12:04.75]My name is Flan, and my brother's name is Muck.
[12:07.57]That's me.
[12:08.47]Yes, what do you want?
[12:09.48]Long plank.
[12:10.52]Whoa!
[12:11.02]You know, very long planks are hard to handle.
[12:13.96]And they come with a price.
[12:16.10]Are you sure?
[12:18.08]Alright, matey.
[12:19.34]Actually, for you to render a very long plank, you also need... Shoot!
[12:24.23]I forgot!
[12:25.65]Hey, Goku!
[12:28.80]Yeah?
[12:30.04]What do you need to rent a very long plank?
[12:33.51]You mean the diploma of certification for handling very long planks?
[12:37.34]Right.
[12:37.64]Do you have a certificate for handling very long planks, sir?
[12:42.52]Yes, I do.
[12:44.02]Hey, don't pull my leg.
[12:45.08]You don't have a certification.
[12:46.93]You're a funny guy.
[12:48.63]Of course you want one.
[12:49.83]Don't worry.
[12:50.39]It's not in the house.
[12:51.75]Hey, Muck.
[12:53.15]What is it, Flan?
[12:54.41]This wood face wants the diploma of certification for handling very long planks.
[12:59.81]Oh, really?
[13:01.09]Get ready, matey.
[13:02.71]Let's go.
[13:08.29]Turn it up.
[13:23.11]Oh, this is good.
[13:23.92]I like it.
[13:24.26]This is a good song.
[13:33.22]I drank two coffees, by the way, so there's no way I get hit again.
[13:35.62]Nice.
[13:49.29]Are they playing?
[13:49.91]Oh, they have like guitars?
[13:51.57]Those are like wood guitars.
[13:59.07]Oops!
[14:16.78]You are worthy of the diploma of certification for handling very long planks.
[14:20.60]There.
[14:23.16]Now it's up on the wall.
[14:25.16]And of course, here's your very long plank.
[14:31.31]Just pick it up?
[14:40.64]You picked up the Very Long Plank as my diploma.
[14:44.34]The diploma reads, Diploma of Certification for Handling Very Long Planks.
[14:49.68]One who has earned the certificate has not only amassed a body of knowledge pursuant to handling very long planks, but also has demonstrated proficiency in wicked dance moves and an impeccable personal style.
[15:01.51]What the fuck was that?
[15:02.09]What a nice diploma.
[15:02.83]Please leave your diploma here.
[15:04.39]I have only five voices.
[15:29.46]Okay, so I have a plank now.
[15:36.22]Where do I put that?
[15:42.86]Oh, it's this guy.
[15:43.37]I remember this guy.
[15:44.21]Fuck up.
[16:01.64]Here's the plank, right here.
[16:04.66]Try to be careful.
[16:08.37]Certified welder?
[16:12.81]Oh, save the game, right.
[16:13.99]I forgot the lanterns did that.
[16:18.07]Save.
[16:30.59]Hello?
[16:31.87]Nosferatu.
[16:33.89]It's a sneeze joke.
[16:36.15]I warn you, Red.
[16:37.05]The maze monster lurks here.
[16:41.16]If it finds you, try to escape.
[16:45.68]It's relentless.
[16:47.62]That monster guards something.
[16:51.88]If... Sorry, I forgot what it was.
[17:02.25]I just look around here first?
[17:03.71]Are there any items in this game or is it just a bunch of dances?
[17:08.87]What the fuck was that?
[17:09.88]Okay, did I... Oh my god.
[17:14.36]Oh shit.
[17:20.58]Nice.
[17:56.19]Let's go.
[17:56.61]Let's go.
[17:56.95]Let's go.
[17:57.21]I'm ready.
[17:57.57]I'm ready.
[17:57.87]Holy shit.
[18:00.81]Oh my fucking lord.
[18:02.09]Alright.
[18:02.75]I gotta stay on the left side.
[18:05.30]Definitely.
[18:34.54]What the fuck am I supposed to do about that one?
[18:40.62]What was that button?
[18:44.92]That was like a Sonic the Hedgehog spring.
[18:55.19]Nice, alright.
[18:56.27]Fuckin' idiot.
[18:58.25]I need full health for this.
[19:00.61]Alright, alright, alright.
[19:29.40]Jesus God!
[19:30.46]I gotta get that one down.
[19:36.22]Alright, so what does the red button do?
[19:44.29]Do I have to touch the button?
[19:48.84]I like the song though.
[19:49.58]I gotta put both headphones in.
[19:50.66]That's the problem.
[20:00.19]Stupid fucking idiot.
[20:01.27]Alright, stop, stop, stop.
[20:02.93]Stop, stop.
[20:04.76]I jumped over the button!
[20:06.40]Ugh!
[20:35.93]I... Button, button, button.
[20:44.52]Where's the button?
[20:45.82]Here it comes.
[20:46.14]Fuck you.
[20:58.49]Fuck!
[20:59.53]Shut up.
[21:09.81]Not you, you don't have to shut up.
[21:11.37]It's me that has to shut up.
[21:12.39]Alright.
[21:19.95]I swear to god, it's just a reaction.
[21:22.37]It's hitting the jump button on everything.
[21:27.09]It's time to jump, jump, jump!
[21:40.66]Got it!
[21:41.94]What?
[21:43.22]Oh my god, he's running around.
[21:44.76]He's running around.
[21:45.57]He's running around.
[21:46.09]What do I do?
[21:49.05]Where do I go?
[21:52.47]Ooh!
[21:53.25]You found a crystal key.
[21:54.71]Get me out.
[21:56.03]Should I hide?
[22:04.85]Ah!
[22:16.17]Get me out.
[22:19.92]Can I dodge him when he goes down the hall?
[22:22.30]I did it.
[22:22.58]I got it.
[22:25.44]Maze monster lurks here.
[22:26.76]Okay, I got the key.
[22:30.96]Okay, so I got the key.
[22:34.27]Okay.
[22:34.49]Whoa.
[22:37.75]Whoa.
[22:44.33]This is my room.
[22:45.73]It ain't much.
[22:49.69]Sorry.
[22:50.01]It'd be nice if I had some more furniture.
[22:56.50]Game console with Super Racket inserted.
[22:59.58]Wanna play some Super Racket with me?
[23:02.60]Sure.
[23:03.96]Okay, I warn you.
[23:06.10]You're quite good.
[23:06.79]Hi.
[23:06.97]SEGA.
[23:18.02]This is it.
[23:22.92]Oh, we actually are doing this.
[23:24.81]Deflect with X. Okay.
[23:35.56]Somebody just did that inside of my head.
[23:37.64]That sucked.
[23:39.34]I don't want to hear that again.
[23:40.18]I don't want to hear that noise ever again.
[23:50.51]Okay, I can just... It's too much!
[24:05.82]If you ever want to play again, I will be here.
[24:15.87]That was kinda cool.
[24:20.03]You're pretty good at this.
[24:21.71]I mean, I'm playing... I gotta give myself credit.
[24:25.65]If anything that you require me to press a button at a certain time, I've made this remark before, and some of the new viewers can listen to this as well.
[24:35.63]If a game has four face buttons and it's in a control stick, I will be able to do good at that game.
[24:43.91]If we're talking four buttons, that's it.
[24:49.52]If there is like a dodge, a punch, and like a run, I will do good in that game.
[24:57.91]Save the game, right?
[25:09.58]What about Minecraft?
[25:11.96]No, no, no, no, so I'm sorry.
[25:13.64]Minecraft has way more shit to do.
[25:16.16]It's like a crafting menu.
[25:17.78]You have to press like a, you have to combine.
[25:19.46]No, no, no.
[25:20.90]If the only thing you do in the game is jump, dodge, and attack, and move, I will be, I will win.
[25:30.52]What?
[25:32.30]Careful with that stuff.
[25:36.02]Door's unlocked.
[25:41.41]What about Dark Souls?
[25:42.73]Well, here's the thing, Dark Souls, I could literally use the default weapon in Dark Souls you find in the very beginning and you could still get through the game.
[25:51.41]You can find some shitty katana on the ground in Dark Souls and you could get through the game.
[25:56.55]It doesn't matter.
[26:04.17]Up.
[26:05.57]What?
[26:08.05]Hi!
[26:09.03]Did I lose?
[26:09.65]What happened?
[26:11.51]Oh, okay.
[26:21.81]Okay.
[26:22.95]What?
[26:23.79]Hey, stop!
[26:26.75]Okay, it's- I get it.
[26:28.11]Hey, you gotta go up.
[26:29.59]Some- it's a joke.
[26:31.36]Up.
[26:32.94]Up.
[26:36.74]How do I go up from here?
[26:40.80]Yeah.
[26:41.80]Yeah, I'm not playing your game.
[26:43.92]That's down.
[26:44.54]How do I know which one goes up?
[26:53.49]Oh.
[26:53.97]Okay, I got it.
[26:54.47]What's this?
[26:57.37]You picked up the handle piece of a door.
[27:04.27]I'm bored.
[27:04.57]I'm gonna go read Calvin and Hobbes.
[27:05.93]I mean, I completely... I put a stamp of approval on that.
[27:10.65]Calvin and Hobbes is fucking... one of the greatest ever.
[27:18.80]No, I can, like, say that that's a good idea.
[27:21.10]I mean, we could probably get, like, Jerma985, Calvin and Hobbes, and Garfield is, like, the best cartoon characters probably ever, right?
[27:26.98]So... That's okay.
[27:29.02]You have the biggest challenge ahead of you.
[27:37.06]This is the mirror of truth and I will allow you to leave my castle.
[27:39.80]Which is probably up here.
[27:43.54]John Arbuckle.
[27:46.60]I am royal guard of castles.
[27:47.88]My guard important.
[27:49.26]Very important.
[27:52.70]Enter alone only.
[27:54.92]What?
[27:55.12]Why?
[27:56.20]Rules are rules.
[28:01.48]I don't have any legs and this guy is mute.
[28:03.30]Would you really deny us entrance?
[28:08.31]Were you only?
[28:08.95]Okay.
[28:22.91]How's the mirror?
[28:23.49]Okay.
[28:27.77]Okay, um, let's walk around it.
[28:45.19]I think you should keep trying to look at the mirror.
[28:46.83]Maybe try to examine it from the other sides.
[28:48.61]I just did that.
[28:51.35]Huh?
[29:05.42]This is my first stream.
[29:06.42]Say hi.
[29:06.94]What's going on?
[29:07.52]Did I stare at it?
[29:14.80]What if I just don't move and look at it?
[29:23.69]It's not even a mirror.
[29:24.55]Okay, it's not doing anything.
[29:38.14]What?
[29:38.70]What just happened?
[29:42.21]Oh, look at you!
[29:43.25]Look at me!
[29:45.32]What gives you the right to come here and control me?
[29:49.15]I wish you would just leave.
[29:50.45]You disgust me.
[29:55.72]This wooden cage, not always been like this.
[30:00.69]I divided myself into pieces to protect everyone.
[30:07.41]Once you leave, I have to deal with everything.
[30:14.57]He's made out of wood.
[30:15.37]He would be like creaking and shit.
[30:17.13]I'm the actor, you're not an actor.
[30:20.69]I hate you for it.
[30:21.45]I wish you would just stop.
[30:26.01]I want you to leave.
[30:27.07]I don't want to talk to you again.
[30:29.21]Why is this guy so annoying?
[30:34.79]Okay.
[30:37.39]Do I leave?
[30:46.44]Is this like...
[30:57.86]This is you and your emo phase.
[30:59.32]Talk to me!
[31:02.86]I am Royal Guard.
[31:15.77]I guard important, very important.
[31:16.99]Can I leave now?
[31:20.97]Well done, little puppet.
[31:21.95]You are one step closer to helping us all.
[31:24.72]In another time, you will come back.
[31:27.68]Then you will slay the beast within and passage will open.
[31:31.84]The end is nearing us.
[31:33.00]You are now free to leave.
[31:33.98]Okay.
[31:43.95]Ooh.
[31:45.93]Hold on.
[31:47.05]My headphones got tied up.
[31:49.09]That's kind of hard to use.
[31:51.00]This is kind of cool.
[31:56.33]I should play Noita.
[32:00.11]I have played Noita.
[32:02.05]And it created a big problem for me.
[32:09.04]Alright, yeah.
[32:09.36]I'm just untying my headphones.
[32:12.10]So they can sit on my ears better.
[32:15.84]Okay.
[32:18.28]What's over here?
[32:21.29]Come and experience the race of your lifetime.
[32:26.05]Alright.
[32:27.39]Let's go.
[32:34.62]Alright.
[32:34.98]This is pretty good.
[32:37.08]Wow, look at them races go.
[32:43.82]Someday, I hope to win.
[32:45.82]My sibling is into fantasy games.
[32:47.60]Alright, I'll tell you.
[32:49.00]I have both headphones in and it's loud for me because obviously I want to feel the music.
[32:53.48]That's a requirement.
[32:54.28]Otherwise, you know, the exit signs.
[32:56.53]So, but I can't hear myself talk.
[32:58.57]So it's hard to like talk.
[32:59.63]I don't even know what I sound like right now.
[33:02.59]I have no idea what I sound like.
[33:03.57]You sound like you're drunk.
[33:11.64]I can't hear myself talk, which means I can't talk well.
[33:16.33]Why me?
[33:17.13]Why me?
[33:17.69]Why me?
[33:18.21]What's the point of learning new skills?
[33:27.06]You'll just get bored and forget all that knowledge over time.
[33:30.96]Maintaining your driving skills for example.
[33:33.67]What does anyone get out of that anyways?
[33:36.03]I guess when it comes down to it, I need to stop thinking about the future.
[33:38.67]Enjoy what's in front of me instead of what's ahead.
[33:43.15]That's why they've had like 10 WoW expansions.
[33:46.21]The exact reason you're describing.
[33:47.53]I have to treat my life like I'm going through a cave full of gems.
[33:53.75]And try to collect as many as I can.
[33:55.13]Because otherwise, what's the point?
[34:00.62]WoW reference -2.
[34:01.84]No.
[34:02.44]No, it wasn't.
[34:03.48]No, it wasn't.
[34:05.11]Hi there.
[34:05.98]A red rider?
[34:07.40]Can you smell the gasoline?
[34:08.50]Can you feel the thrill?
[34:11.14]Are you getting p-p-p-p-p-p-pumped?
[34:14.04]Do you want to participate in the race?
[34:17.69]Yes.
[34:18.41]How exciting.
[34:19.23]Let us get you a cart.
[34:26.18]Wait, I actually get to drive this?
[34:29.53]Welcome all racers.
[34:31.38]Tonight and all other nights, we will race until the end of time.
[34:36.40]Why am I all the way back here?
[34:38.16]This isn't fair.
[34:46.44]What?
[34:46.71]Brottle is A. Oh my god, are you serious?
[34:59.98]I'm so bad at games like this.
[35:04.41]I thought I had to pick stuff up.
[35:05.75]I don't know.
[35:06.11]I just, I thought I did pick something up.
[35:15.02]Oh, this is crazy.
[35:15.70]Shit.
[35:18.42]I'm not going to be able to beat this.
[35:19.98]I can't win this.
[35:26.62]Oh my God.
[35:27.44]It's too fast.
[35:30.36]No, I'm just Toad.
[35:31.62]Oh, this is what it feels like to be fucking Toad.
[35:34.02]I'm in 20th place still.
[35:50.71]I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
[35:53.55]Fuck, it's hard.
[35:57.51]Don't get lapped like Toad.
[35:59.13]Don't get lapped like Toad on Bowser's Keep, please.
[36:11.55]It's hard to tell where they're coming, they're down the road.
[36:20.58]I'm gonna puke!
[36:22.32]It's too hard!
[36:30.06]It's so... I have no idea.
[36:36.67]It's too much.
[36:41.61]Both headphones in.
[36:42.71]Visual stimulation.
[36:49.96]I'm going at warp speed.
[36:54.04]I'll get it.
[36:54.58]I'll get it.
[36:54.94]Just relax, everybody.
[36:55.78]Hold on.
[36:56.20]Alright, there we go.
[37:02.82]There we go.
[37:04.65]Slow down.
[37:05.39]Come on.
[37:15.60]Come on.
[37:48.21]Right for the middle.
[37:52.74]Come on, it's right there.
[37:55.88]Damn it!
[37:59.98]Ow!
[38:02.04]No!
[38:05.42]No, it's right here.
[38:06.81]I... I still got it.
[38:11.03]I have a chance.
[38:11.61]Oh...
[38:15.88]That was a joke.
[38:16.72]It was a joke.
[38:17.52]Alright, I get it this time.
[38:19.88]Okay, let's go.
[38:20.30]Let's go.
[38:20.88]I'm coming to first place now.
[38:25.47]Let's go.
[38:25.79]See, now I get it.
[38:54.45]Right here.
[39:03.96]Get- You pushed me off the road.
[39:05.32]Fuck you.
[39:05.84]Don't hold the acceleration the whole time.
[39:25.90]Alright, much better position than it was last time.
[39:36.70]Red is climbing through the ranks.
[39:51.08]Who's in first place?
[39:53.24]It's always Mario and Luigi.
[39:55.80]It's such horseshit.
[39:57.50]And if you get even remotely close to either one of those two assholes, they go... And they don't even have a star.
[40:07.53]It's so fucking stupid.
[40:08.49]That game sucks.
[40:09.69]Alright, hold on.
[40:12.39]Don't blow it.
[40:29.13]Can anybody even hear me?
[40:30.23]I don't even know what I'm gonna be talking.
[40:40.74]Hey!
[40:46.32]Get!
[40:49.41]Just don't hit anything.
[40:50.23]I'm right here.
[41:00.16]He's right behind me.
[41:11.33]It's right up ahead.
[41:15.97]I just scared the shit out of me.
[41:19.93]Yes.
[41:21.83]Yes.
[41:25.18]Nice.
[41:25.80]Alright.
[41:28.56]I guess if you hear what I was saying, anytime in Mario, uh, Mario Kart Super Nintendo, you get close to Mario or Luigi, they just have a star.
[41:38.97]It's so, it's annoying.
[41:42.75]They're always in first and second place.
[41:48.35]Congratulations on finishing in first place.
[41:52.44]Thank you.
[41:53.68]Here is your trophy.
[41:55.81]Oh, a trophy!
[41:56.41]You picked up a trophy.
[41:58.55]What does that do?
[42:05.63]Do it multiple times.
[42:08.13]Wait, do the race multiple times?
[42:10.90]It doesn't do anything.
[42:11.84]It does literally nothing.
[42:12.84]Oh.
[42:14.74]That's still fun.
[42:17.74]Hi-ho!
[42:18.64]Welcome, welcome.
[42:19.74]I am Cassius.
[42:20.70]Come and run my humble obstacle course.
[42:25.64]It ain't much, but it's something.
[42:26.88]Hi.
[42:28.12]I will reward you with something yummy if you beat the universal record.
[42:32.88]Want to run the obstacle course?
[42:35.45]Sure.
[42:35.77]Make sure to stretch first.
[42:37.95]I'm not muted.
[42:38.59]Stop.
[42:38.85]I can see my indicators.
[42:44.71]Ready.
[42:47.55]Three, two, one.
[42:49.20]Action.
[42:49.48]Action.
[42:59.34]This is bad.
[43:00.50]I gotta use analog for this.
[43:01.56]Or do I?
[43:01.90]How do I sprint?
[43:02.42]Go.
[43:02.50]Did I do it?
[43:03.88]I got it!
[43:27.22]You beat the record.
[43:27.98]Receive your award outside.
[43:33.40]Well done.
[43:34.80]You'll be rewarded with a homemade delicious scrumptious cake.
[43:41.22]Okay.
[43:42.28]Maybe you can give it to a friend.
[43:46.47]Picked up a cake.
[43:47.13]I like this like kind of little mini games.
[43:51.47]I like this.
[43:53.29]Only VIPs allowed.
[43:55.01]Oh, no need to eat.
[43:56.15]I know, the taste.
[43:57.05]What?
[44:01.21]Wait, anything else I can do?
[44:10.72]What's he doing?
[44:12.12]Look at them racers go.
[44:13.26]Okay.
[44:13.60]Okay, so I gotta go in the VIP room?
[44:27.40]Let's do it.
[44:29.60]Are we theater?
[44:32.60]What are you watching?
[44:34.60]Hello, Red.
[44:36.48]I sometimes come here to relax.
[44:41.32]Just let my mind wander a bit and forget about it all.
[44:47.24]I got it right, good.
[44:49.14]Sorry.
[44:52.46]Here comes my favorite part.
[44:57.86]Wow, that was cool.
[45:01.36]I got to share that with you stranger.
[45:10.61]OK.
[45:10.77]Anything I can do over here?
[45:24.13]Dude, this would be so bad for you.
[45:26.15]Imagine sitting this close to a screen like this and having your eyes open.
[45:33.14]Oh, it hurts to think about that.
[45:34.44]Alright, that was cool.
[45:44.50]This was fun.
[45:56.21]Imagine being that close to your stream.
[46:01.79]VOD watcher point of view.
[46:05.59]Hope you had a good time.
[46:06.83]I did.
[46:09.07]Where am I?
[46:13.24]Wait, what?
[46:14.16]This is not the door we came from.
[46:15.44]Oh.
[46:25.47]That was quite a fall.
[46:29.54]Okay.
[46:32.48]What's up with this?
[46:37.60]We picked up a shiny gem.
[46:46.49]He over here.
[47:00.32]Wait, did I look up here?
[47:01.08]I like the song so far.
[47:13.60]Nothing?
[47:15.30]This is the best song, best character coming up.
[47:23.84]Cool.
[47:29.30]Whoa.
[47:37.10]What's that?
[47:40.14]You found my eye.
[47:41.88]Please give it to me.
[47:42.72]Sure.
[47:44.94]Yes, I am finally restored.
[47:48.62]Oh, I can't believe you of all people saved me.
[47:54.20]What's that supposed to mean?
[47:57.71]Are you here as well, little red nose?
[48:00.61]Aiding the enemy?
[48:03.35]What?
[48:04.31]The enemy?
[48:04.77]The enemy is Gold Pig.
[48:08.26]Because... Oh!
[48:11.44]I might have been lost in the woods for ages.
[48:13.82]But you are the one who is truly lost.
[48:18.36]Anyway, I am not without honor.
[48:20.52]You have helped me.
[48:21.40]So I am in your debt.
[48:23.83]Now that my vision is restored, I can use my magic.
[48:26.89]You seem to be missing an arm.
[48:28.73]Maybe I can help.
[48:30.51]By removing this giant boulder in your way.
[48:35.49]Should we teleport it away?
[48:38.09]Destroy it?
[48:39.77]Why not transform it?
[48:42.93]Now it's a Mario cube.
[48:44.52]How delightful.
[48:47.70]Mage transformed the giant rock into a clay pot.
[48:50.28]This is what happens when you do voices for too long.
[48:54.30]I will now consider the debt repaid.
[48:57.00]I'm still thankful for you bringing me my eye, Red.
[49:00.04]I will remember that.
[49:10.00]You can go now.
[49:11.54]There's no reason for you to continue to stand there.
[49:19.25]Apparently.
[49:19.81]Hey, hold on a second.
[49:24.69]Now that the debt has been repaid,
[49:29.44]You're still the enemy.
[49:31.40]Seeing you in such a weakened state, it would be unfortunate if I didn't, you know, exploit the situation.
[49:38.39]Alright, what do you got?
[49:48.49]Oh, I didn't press the button.
[50:14.02]This might be my favorite song so far.
[50:15.38]Ooh!
[50:15.66]Damn.
[50:41.65]It seems you are still strong even without your arm.
[50:45.09]But you know, I don't really care about any of this.
[50:47.89]I just want to have a good time.
[50:48.97]Thanks to you, now I can.
[50:51.28]I won't forget that you helped me.
[50:52.90]I won't bother you anymore unless you bother me.
[50:55.68]Have fun in the mushroom forest.
[50:58.26]I have enjoyed enough here without going insane.
[51:00.24]That reminds me, I'm extremely late to an appointment.
[51:03.91]See you around.
[51:09.07]Are we in the mushroom forest?
[51:11.15]This is on hard.
[51:11.92]There's something about this place I can't remember.
[51:25.97]Funny.
[51:29.19]Wait!
[51:30.29]This looks like a cave.
[51:31.93]Oh, whoops.
[51:41.67]I feel like this is about to get weird.
[51:42.55]Everything's slowing down.
[51:51.04]I obviously follow the rabbit, but... I am the guardian of the mushroom forest.
[52:00.56]There will come a time when we shall talk.
[52:04.71]But it will not be tonight.
[52:05.87]Okay.
[52:20.07]So unfair.
[52:21.01]Everyone took the good hiding places.
[52:23.73]You still have seven to find.
[52:26.03]Oh, great.
[52:30.46]You found me.
[52:31.56]I don't consider myself so good at hiding as the others.
[52:33.64]But you still have six to find.
[52:40.36]Whoa.
[52:42.72]You found me.
[52:43.89]You still have to find five more.
[52:46.23]See you around, dude.
[52:50.75]Oh, thank God.
[53:00.18]Are you Swedish?
[53:01.18]No.
[53:01.30]If you spend too much time in the Mushroom Forest, you might change.
[53:05.88]What does that mean?
[53:18.06]Oh, you found me.
[53:20.68]I think you should re-evaluate my invisibility spell.
[53:23.90]You still have four to find.
[53:26.74]By the way, we never figured out what that was from.
[53:28.90]It was not from that TV show.
[53:31.30]I don't know what it's from.
[53:32.00]Oh.
[53:34.38]Oh.
[53:45.85]You really stepped into something bad now.
[53:51.78]Oh no, another weirdo.
[53:53.48]Hold on, let me get my weirdo voice ready.
[53:57.04]One, two, three, me, me, me, weirdo, incoming.
[54:01.42]I have finally caught the wooden pestilence.
[54:04.15]I'll make sure it won't be able to escape.
[54:06.63]With my defibrillatory stun gun, it will hurt a bit.
[54:15.49]It will take months before we can use that stun gun again.
[54:18.17]We'd better make the best out of this opportunity.
[54:20.81]Grondale, go pick it up and bring it to the land now, Grondale.
[54:28.25]What are you doing?
[54:29.67]Hurry up.
[54:30.11]I've not been enough of a weirdo for you.
[54:31.95]You doofus.
[54:50.92]There comes the weird guy.
[54:53.70]Don't you know that Gerber does weird characters and he loves to do them.
[54:57.24]Even though they all sound like this.
[54:59.40]Every single one of them.
[55:01.47]It works I think though for most characters.
[55:11.45]You gotta just do the weird guy.
[55:12.77]That's it.
[55:15.55]What the fuck?
[55:21.07]I thought I was supposed to find mushrooms.
[55:28.29]Go back to the bunny.
[55:29.25]I mean, I just got, like, captured.
[55:32.22]What are you talking about?
[55:34.98]Hmm.
[55:36.06]What happened?
[55:36.50]Ah, never mind.
[55:38.54]You can't talk anyway.
[55:39.92]Pick me up and let's get out of here.
[55:46.15]Can I do anything else here?
[55:46.79]Please do anything?
[55:50.21]I don't even want to talk about the things I've seen here.
[55:52.09]You can save your progress here.
[55:53.53]Do you want to save?
[55:55.74]Yes.
[56:00.62]Good luck getting out of here.
[56:02.28]Are you going the light?
[56:08.80]Get out of the way.
[56:11.36]Step away or prepare for trouble.
[56:19.60]I wonder what this song will be.
[56:23.30]He's got one huge arm?
[56:25.15]Not bad so far.
[57:04.49]Oh, my Lord.
[57:14.93]Oh, fuck.
[57:16.44]God damn it.
[57:17.18]That got hard.
[57:18.40]Relax, relax, relax, relax, relax, relax.
[57:41.87]I gotta hug the left side when he does that weird mode.
[57:44.11]Here we go.
[57:45.23]You idiot, that was so easy.
[58:29.34]You good?
[58:38.60]Alright.
[58:40.08]That was a good one too.
[58:57.51]I didn't do it, I promise.
[59:00.51]I didn't do it.
[59:01.09]No, I didn't.
[59:02.23]Strange looking machine.
[59:12.04]You have awakened just in time.
[59:13.74]My masterpiece is about to be unleashed.
[59:16.20]I have constructed an artificial replication of an ancient creature.
[59:19.82]Its raw energy makes it so powerful that it can only exist for a limited time.
[59:24.07]The only chance to bring you down and establish peace once and for all.
[59:29.02]Prepare to face your doom, Redbeard!
[59:30.60]Wooy!
[59:30.72]Oh!
[59:59.60]What's wrong?
[60:00.62]What happened?
[60:05.34]Did I lose?
[60:08.17]What happened?
[60:09.41]Ah!
[60:09.71]What?
[60:10.71]How could you have defeated my masterpiece so swiftly?
[60:14.11]I didn't even stand a chance!
[60:16.77]Oh, even more powerful than I imagined.
[60:19.30]There must be another way.
[60:22.56]We will meet again, Red Marauder.
[60:27.76]Okay.
[60:29.70]The door is shut tight.
[60:32.14]Alright.
[60:36.34]Go get the mushrooms.
[60:38.02]Go back and get the mushrooms.
[60:40.18]Can I go back from here?
[60:40.98]There's no door.
[60:44.34]I can't go anywhere from here.
[60:48.68]Are you enjoying the game?
[60:49.55]This is great.
[60:57.80]What the hell is going on in here?
[61:12.32]This is freaking me out.
[61:18.28]Oh, actually, you know what?
[61:19.20]You're going to think I'm crazy for a second, but trust me, I'm doing this for a reason.
[61:26.02]I need to move that over the dead pixel.
[61:29.14]Let me get it in the right spot.
[61:31.02]I have a dead pixel on my monitor, and I think that actually if I move it to this right spot, it'll fix it, right?
[61:36.80]Let's see.
[61:38.61]It's like, how do I move it?
[61:39.49]I'm gonna move it over here.
[61:44.49]Alright, it's on the dead pixel right now.
[61:50.25]It only works for some types of, it takes hours for that shit to work, does it?
[61:56.93]It's not gonna work if I sit here?
[61:58.07]Oh, oh well.
[62:04.16]Yeah, it's, it's green.
[62:05.26]The pixels, so it's not a dead pixel, it's a stuck pixel, right?
[62:07.72]Alright, who are you?
[62:08.84]They're everywhere.
[62:11.14]What do they want?
[62:12.54]Let me be.
[62:13.02]I don't wanna.
[62:14.38]Make it stop.
[62:15.24]Make it stop.
[62:15.60]Make it stop.
[62:16.06]I don't wanna.
[62:16.48]Make it stop.
[62:16.92]Make it stop.
[62:17.40]Make it stop.
[62:18.10]Make it stop.
[62:18.50]Make it stop.
[62:18.84]Make it stop.
[62:19.22]Make it stop.
[62:20.96]The TV?
[62:23.68]How long must I endure?
[62:25.28]How long has it been?
[62:26.02]How long has it been?
[62:26.56]How long has it been?
[62:27.48]Who said that?
[62:27.92]Who's there?
[62:28.20]Stop laughing at me.
[62:31.66]It hurts.
[62:32.28]I just wanted to stop.
[62:32.96]It hurts.
[62:33.36]Just wanted to stop.
[62:34.06]Rest a bit.
[62:34.81]Please.
[62:35.13]I don't want it to just stop.
[62:36.13]I don't want it to hurt.
[62:36.73]Stop it.
[62:37.09]Don't do it.
[62:37.47]Stop.
[62:37.83]Stop it.
[62:38.37]Stop.
[62:38.79]Stop.
[62:39.11]Stop it.
[62:39.73]Alright.
[62:40.03]I'm getting out of here.
[62:41.23]No, I didn't want to do that again.
[62:43.59]Did I keep talking to them?
[62:44.93]It never ends.
[62:45.49]Why won't it end?
[62:46.47]Must I suffer forever?
[62:47.35]It never ends.
[62:49.45]That damn mage.
[62:50.25]Why does it torture me?
[62:51.47]I want to leave.
[62:52.03]I don't know where to go.
[62:53.79]I'm useless.
[62:54.35]They're everywhere.
[62:57.33]Okay, well, I turned off the TV.
[63:00.12]Can they leave now?
[63:00.68]I don't know.
[63:06.12]It's an average Jerma viewer.
[63:12.12]You can... You can leave whenever you want.
[63:16.04]I don't know.
[63:16.33]I'm not holding you here.
[63:29.62]Uh-oh.
[63:34.18]Why do you think we can leave?
[63:35.98]I don't know.
[63:36.42]Because you can.
[63:38.16]All the circumstances are optimal.
[63:42.31]I have analyzed the triggering factors of what is considered a battle, using quantum theory, to artificially create a battle that is not considered a battle.
[63:53.17]You can't resort to your dirty tricks, Red Mage.
[63:56.49]This will be the end of you.
[64:02.18]Oh, I can run.
[64:11.91]No jumping.
[64:37.08]Alright, what do you got?
[64:40.70]What do you got?
[64:47.07]What do you got?
[64:47.43]What's going on?
[64:47.81]Do I have to attack it?
[65:10.63]Yikes!
[65:21.10]Yikes!
[65:40.07]Oh, I thought it was over!
[65:45.59]Fuck.
[66:02.93]That was sick.
[66:04.92]Remarkable.
[66:06.33]My efforts have proven futile once again.
[66:08.17]Is there nothing that can stop you?
[66:12.20]Hope you find it in your heart to forgive my actions.
[66:15.38]I just want to find a solution.
[66:16.92]This won't be the last time we meet, Red Mage.
[66:19.78]That was cool.
[66:27.31]Go in there.
[66:33.76]We're all being paid by your mother to watch the stream.
[66:35.58]None of them want to be here.
[66:36.82]Nobody wants to be here.
[66:38.83]Okay.
[66:39.93]If my mother was paying each of you $1 to be here every stream, that's almost $17,000 a stream.
[66:50.15]That's extreme.
[66:52.37]I stream probably two days a week.
[66:56.03]You're talking about like $40,000 a week that my mother is paying to have you all be here.
[67:02.33]So that's $160,000 a month.
[67:03.59]So you're telling me that my mother is spending more than $1.1 or $1.2 million a year just to have you stay here and pretend to like the stream.
[67:19.42]And that's only if you were getting $1 to be here.
[67:23.54]And I'll be honest with you, right?
[67:24.67]Think about that.
[67:25.83]If somebody were to ask you to, hey, I want you to go watch this stream for, you know, four to six hours.
[67:32.07]I'll give you a dollar.
[67:33.35]You'd be like, no fucking way.
[67:35.01]You'd be like, make it 50.
[67:38.37]You're not doing that for a dollar.
[67:39.73]You're doing that for at least like 30 to 40 dollars, at least.
[67:43.07]There's no way you're going to do that for that little.
[67:49.88]Like, if my mother's not giving you at least, like, a 20, or, like, at least, like, a 30 bucks to be there, uh-uh.
[67:56.30]There's no way.
[67:57.60]I want to get that.
[68:02.00]Can you imagine?
[68:04.24]Can you actually imagine if, like, I was actually truly paying people to stay here?
[68:13.84]And you guys are not bots.
[68:15.58]I'm actually, like, hiring people to pretend to be an audience.
[68:21.17]That would be so weird.
[68:30.90]When's the paycheck?
[68:38.34]Okay.
[68:38.62]No, no, no.
[68:39.48]Don't go back in.
[68:42.52]Happy Saturday.
[68:43.08]Yeah, happy Saturday.
[68:46.12]Okay, now we're looking for the mushrooms.
[68:48.83]Or maybe not.
[68:59.97]If there's an orange that's in the message, they have failed to annihilate the doll.
[69:05.29]Yes, but they will move back to a hideout.
[69:08.99]That doll could have been far back.
[69:11.67]It's a ground similar to my faction.
[69:13.53]The orange means just that it is.
[69:16.07]The doll peeks at the blue door piece and the orange is right before it left.
[69:20.43]What?
[69:21.86]Yes, sir.
[69:23.34]The Doll has gained the piece from the Cursed Cousin.
[69:28.32]The Doll has still not gained the piece.
[69:31.88]Well, I have no idea if the Doll can hear us.
[69:37.00]It's using some sort of telepathic magic.
[69:41.63]How long has it been listening?
[69:44.27]I can disrupt the magic if you desire, Golden Pig.
[69:48.25]Not another word.
[69:51.25]I'll do it myself.
[69:55.17]I'll do it myself.
[70:05.46]Hey, are you alright?
[70:12.82]You kind of zoned out there for a while.
[70:21.91]Alright, looking for mushrooms.
[70:22.69]Oh.
[70:31.85]Can I run down?
[70:36.22]That didn't make any sense.
[70:43.04]I made it to the other side.
[70:43.78]Alright, mushrooms.
[70:53.93]Hello there.
[70:54.35]Do you want to save?
[70:55.01]Yes, I do.
[70:55.99]Change.
[71:01.64]Alright, alright, alright.
[71:06.12]Hi.
[71:06.54]I guess you found me.
[71:07.38]You still have three to find.
[71:09.80]Bye.
[71:10.24]Three more.
[71:17.40]I think I already went up by this one.
[71:22.86]Oh, hello.
[71:23.64]I guess you did find me.
[71:24.82]You still have two to find.
[71:25.86]Farewell.
[71:30.04]Active.
[71:31.89]Find the bunny.
[71:35.29]Alright, I'll get the bunny.
[71:36.83]I already went up here.
[71:41.17]Is this fun?
[71:46.45]Oh, you found me.
[71:47.13]I knew I should have chosen a better hiding spot.
[71:49.87]You still have one to find.
[71:53.53]Don't even start doing Morty, you idiot.
[71:55.04]Alright, I got them all.
[71:57.60]It was the last mushroom.
[71:58.48]We'll be waiting by the forest guardian far to the west.
[72:03.89]Oh, Rick.
[72:14.73]It's this person right, okay Right now you are the annoying audiobook voice actor you complained about I'm not no, I'm not actually No, I didn't complain about audiobooks I just said it's hard to be an audiobook voice narrator because you have to do like 60 people's voices over the course of the whole story and
[72:44.08]Guys, even the best voice actors in the room, I was gonna say, even the best voice actors in the room, if you tell them to do all their voices back to back to back to back, you will be able to tell it's the same person.
[72:57.51]You will.
[72:58.85]Nobody can be different people.
[73:05.65]For instance,
[73:07.19]I am the guardian of the mushroom forest.
[73:10.09]I will open a passage for you.
[73:12.35]Let me tell you that this is entirely optional.
[73:15.63]You are not forced to be here.
[73:17.85]This is only for those seeking answers.
[73:20.87]There will come a time when we shall talk.
[73:25.51]But it will not be tonight.
[73:29.15]See?
[73:29.69]Like, that was me talking.
[73:31.53]You knew that was me talking.
[73:34.07]Why can't I go in there?
[73:37.30]found us all.
[73:39.52]What the hell?
[73:46.18]Hi there, you found us.
[73:47.22]Go talk to the divine mushroom.
[73:48.92]What the fuck is the divine mushroom?
[74:06.64]Welcome to my domain, for your efforts in indulging my kin.
[74:11.30]For giving them some joy, I cannot offer you much.
[74:19.35]Can't offer you much.
[74:22.35]But I can give you a bathroom break.
[74:27.49]You need to pee very badly.
[74:28.77]Enjoy the break while you pee.
[74:33.36]Drinking water all day.
[74:35.87]Be right back before I do another big one.
[74:41.95]Oh, it's still the Christmas thing.
[74:42.95]Oh, shit.
[74:45.46]Hey, it's still Christmas in my mind.
[74:46.96]I'll be right back.
[74:47.54]I gotta pee.
[76:55.06]Thanks for watching!
[78:36.41]I just want to grab some beef jerky too.
[78:40.01]I promise that I won't choke on it or inhale it like I did in the Lord of the Rings spring.
[78:52.84]Sponsored?
[78:55.08]I didn't tell you what brand I'm eating.
[79:01.40]Sponsored by who?
[79:10.30]Sponsored by the beef industry.
[79:15.37]Beef industry sponsor.
[79:21.65]I'm not in Congress.
[79:24.31]I don't have lobbyists.
[79:25.88]What are you talking about?
[79:29.48]I really liked his streams.
[79:31.16]Once the big beef industry got involved and started lobbying him.
[79:34.78]What?
[79:34.94]What?
[79:41.92]Alright, I'm ready.
[79:46.89]What'd you say?
[79:47.35]I like this comment.
[79:51.65]I bet your breath always smells like you just ate jerky.
[79:56.12]No, it's not garlic.
[79:58.12]I'm not eating cloves of garlic.
[79:59.88]Beef jerky does not stay with you in your clothes and shit.
[80:02.45]It's just like fucking, what are you talking about?
[80:15.89]What are you on about?
[80:19.95]It still has an aroma.
[80:25.49]Okay.
[80:26.89]What about every other food?
[80:27.82]Do you have, like, chicken nugget breath?
[80:34.16]Did you eat a bowl of cereal?
[80:35.14]Are you gonna have, like, wheat grass on your breath?
[80:40.69]No, I think your breath just stinks.
[80:44.96]That's it.
[80:45.74]Nobody knows what you had for dinner.
[80:47.28]They just know that you smell.
[80:48.24]Holly said... There you go.
[81:01.75]There's your proof.
[81:04.83]Holly literally just said, I don't smell like beef.
[81:07.83]Like, I don't smell like a meat aroma.
[81:12.21]Confirmed.
[81:23.03]My headcanon is that you smell like weed.
[81:25.17]Why are you headcanoning what I smell like?
[81:35.34]You know what?
[81:36.92]You know what I do smell like?
[81:37.68]I smell like a dryer sheet.
[81:48.20]I smell like a dryer sheet and motor oil together.
[81:51.40]You understand?
[81:52.38]Like it's just light motor oil and dryer sheet.
[81:59.68]Maybe like a hint of grilled onions.
[82:14.00]What a disgusting smell.
[82:16.47]Are you willing to risk your soul?
[82:18.09]Yes.
[82:19.03]I am neither glad nor sad.
[82:23.45]You smell like piss.
[82:24.19]I do not smell like piss.
[82:25.31]I'm very... If I'm not going to mess around and be honest with you, I'm very aware of how I smell.
[82:32.22]I always am trying to be clean.
[82:34.00]I always want my clothes to be clean.
[82:35.34]I always want to have a shower before I go anywhere or do anything.
[82:38.84]I always am very aware of my cleanliness of my body.
[82:46.64]Just go.
[82:47.44]Alright.
[82:48.84]Settle down.
[82:49.42]Relax.
[82:49.88]I'm just hanging out.
[82:53.18]Find peace in your endeavors.
[82:54.32]Take a few steps back, please.
[83:06.61]Good.
[83:11.89]Now let this happen.
[83:14.51]Things might get strange.
[83:21.28]Ow.
[83:31.85]Alright, it's a worm fight.
[83:35.65]Whoa.
[83:49.69]Time to get weird.
[83:53.74]What the fuck?
[83:55.92]Shit.
[83:57.30]Whoa, I can't even see that.
[84:27.71]Hello, human.
[84:28.57]Can you see us?
[84:29.59]I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking for.
[84:33.51]Jesus.
[84:33.75]Why are you here?
[84:34.27]Oh, fuck.
[85:04.70]This is so wild.
[85:10.99]You are hurting.
[85:13.99]Please quit.
[85:19.24]Never!
[85:19.54]I'll never quit!
[85:24.22]I will give it 100% always!
[85:24.88]And potentially go beyond!
[85:31.58]110%!
[85:31.60]That hurt my throat doing that, why?
[86:31.98]It seems that you are back.
[86:34.88]Did you know what you were getting yourself into?
[86:39.20]You don't have to keep coming back.
[86:41.85]You're always watching.
[86:46.04]Hope you're enjoying yourself.
[86:48.06]That you have something to do.
[86:50.38]Being it.
[86:51.96]It's not always easy.
[86:54.84]Have you come to hear an absolute truth?
[86:56.38]Yes.
[87:02.70]There is a risk you might change upon hearing it.
[87:06.07]Sometimes not for the better.
[87:08.43]Are you sure you want to hear an absolute truth?
[87:16.45]This is where the machine elves come in.
[87:21.81]There are several absolute truths.
[87:25.25]One of them is... You are me and I am you.
[87:34.82]Even the ones you hate and love remain true to yourself.
[87:41.86]Your thoughts were never yours anyways.
[87:44.76]Take this truth.
[87:46.55]It is now in your hands to truly interpret.
[87:51.55]It's humorous how you wanted to experience this life.
[87:55.11]We told you many times to not go through with this.
[87:58.07]We thought it would be fun, and here you are.
[88:00.83]We look forward to sitting, talking, and laughing about all this when you return.
[88:08.33]You must go forward.
[88:10.80]We will let you return to your world.
[88:13.32]We hope you find what you're looking for.
[88:16.06]You must now leave.
[88:22.32]It's turning British.
[88:24.30]Welcome back.
[88:25.16]Hope you enjoyed that experience.
[88:27.18]You strike me as an adventurous sport.
[88:29.46]Take this precious gemstone.
[88:31.16]It might be useful someday.
[88:33.32]Maybe not this day.
[88:38.50]You picked up a ruby!
[88:43.09]Alright, new item.
[88:44.19]Can I go in here now?
[88:48.63]Guarding the forest, there will be a come time.
[88:50.21]Do I have to pay him in a ruby?
[88:54.65]You smell like Sour Patch Kids and old cigarette butts.
[89:01.45]So I smell like a movie theater?
[89:07.42]I smell like the outside of a movie theater.
[89:18.23]Now that's an absolute truth.
[89:22.21]Alright, whatever.
[89:25.39]Would you like an absolute truth?
[89:27.43]Yes.
[89:29.49]You smell like Sour Patch Kids and cigarette butts.
[89:32.33]That'd be so funny.
[89:34.11]I wish they would put that in here.
[89:37.80]An absolute truth.
[89:38.54]Your breath is awful.
[89:41.76]Smells like you just opened up a tuna can.
[89:46.06]And put it inside of a dog shit bag.
[89:51.04]Hope you found something extraordinary.
[89:52.90]You can now return to your realm.
[89:59.32]Okay.
[90:13.44]Damn, alright.
[90:14.14]That was cool.
[90:17.20]Who's this frog?
[90:22.28]I like it for what it is.
[90:24.24]I will be expecting many great things from you.
[90:28.44]It will get louder in ways you might not be able to imagine.
[90:51.61]Voice is bad.
[90:52.27]Voice is bad.
[90:52.91]Shitty voice.
[90:53.47]Worse voice.
[90:54.17]Okay, fine.
[90:55.43]I'll give you one that you like.
[90:58.71]But I shouldn't let you worry too much.
[91:02.62]You're ever lost.
[91:03.86]Maybe talk to your blue friend.
[91:05.90]I bet they have a keen sense of direction.
[91:12.05]Opposite ends of the spectrum for horrible and not getting the good one.
[91:16.30]I know you want to be like alright You're ever lost maybe talk to your blue friend I Bet they have a keen sense of direction now that would have been good, right?
[91:32.19]Hey you fine piece of craftsmanship Want to swing by midnight town the nicest place around I
[91:49.14]That was a perfect voice for a frog where the world wasn't ready for it.
[91:53.54]Yeah.
[91:54.78]Trust me, I know.
[91:55.38]Alright, we got a lot of places I can go.
[91:59.79]Is this kind of like the Mega Man open world screen?
[92:01.93]Do I just pick a world and go?
[92:03.07]Hey Red, instead of going back there, how about we go to Midnight Town?
[92:06.28]Oh.
[92:22.95]Cool.
[92:27.58]Time is only temporary.
[92:33.16]True.
[92:40.01]What's this?
[92:40.53]Casino.
[92:42.15]What are we playing?
[92:46.22]Looking forward to playing.
[92:47.24]It's fun pretending to be someone else.
[92:48.71]Oh, it's just like D&D.
[92:50.61]I can't wait to get started.
[92:51.45]Hi there, Red.
[92:54.01]We can finally start the game.
[92:55.27]Let's go.
[92:58.13]Certainly is out of my comfort zone, but I don't have anything else to do.
[93:05.02]Sorry about that, but I do like your company.
[93:08.64]Welcome, Red.
[93:09.24]There's still room for one more player if you want to join.
[93:11.86]I promise you it's going to be blast.
[93:16.56]Alright.
[93:18.47]Yeah, let's play.
[93:19.11]Wait, what's in here?
[93:20.67]Hatch is shut tight.
[93:21.47]You can't get it open.
[93:25.19]Seems we're all finally here now.
[93:27.21]Are you ready?
[93:28.17]Ready for an epic adventure?
[93:29.21]Yes.
[93:31.26]Good.
[93:32.00]Let me just set the mood.
[93:42.06]Let the adventure begin.
[93:46.97]Once upon a time, in the land of Medallion, there was a village whose name had been forgotten.
[93:54.92]The little town was settled with happy, hard-working villagers.
[93:58.94]But beyond the lake, deep in the darkness, stood a tower so tall that it reached the clouds.
[94:09.19]The villagers could see mysterious lights and shadows moving at the top of the tower.
[94:14.42]fearing that an evil wizard had taken hold of the tower.
[94:20.28]Townspeople hoped for a hero to save them from their presumably ill fate.
[94:27.78]Within the village was a temple that protected an ancient relic capable of withstanding evil.
[94:36.99]A sword that deflects red attacks.
[94:43.48]Really?
[94:44.86]That's a really dumb name.
[94:47.62]I find it quite descriptive.
[94:50.10]Guys, please don't interrupt.
[94:58.92]During a dark, rainy night, a warrior entered the temple.
[95:14.72]Oh, great warrior, take this sword, our most valuable relic.
[95:18.38]Vanquish all the evil and save our small village.
[95:26.65]Receive this sword and gain its powers of deflecting red attacks.
[95:37.46]With this power, you might be able to face the evil wizard.
[95:42.16]Now before... What the fuck?
[95:46.46]Give me all your treasure!
[95:48.34]Or pay with your lives!
[95:50.79]Oh, great warrior, we're helpless.
[95:52.31]Save us from this foul bandit!
[96:01.57]I can deflect red.
[96:02.65]Deflect is X. Okay.
[96:03.76]Okay.
[96:27.10]Get out of town.
[96:34.92]You have bested me.
[96:41.74]You saved us, oh great warrior.
[96:43.38]Hooray.
[96:43.84]Hooray.
[96:45.36]Hooray.
[96:46.64]Now, make haste to the tower and defeat the evil witches.
[96:56.76]The warrior has a quest.
[96:58.70]Little did the warrior know what terrible challenges were ahead.
[97:03.61]Seems like such a waste of time.
[97:04.89]We could be doing something more important, Red.
[97:10.67]Mermaid Man.
[97:13.94]Evil wizards!
[97:15.86]No, we need to get into the boat and go get them, SpongeBob!
[97:24.53]What are you doing, you old moron?
[97:27.55]I am trying to do what it is a superhero must be doing.
[97:32.77]Getting to the bank.
[97:36.43]We cashed that check two days ago.
[97:40.48]What?
[97:43.14]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[97:45.36]That wasn't SpongeBob.
[97:46.40]That was Barnacle Boy.
[97:47.38]I have no idea what you're talking about.
[97:53.32]I'm glad you're the warrior, Red.
[97:54.62]Alright, get to the tower and fight.
[97:59.67]Yeah, that was Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy.
[98:04.89]That wasn't SpongeBob.
[98:07.95]Oh, this is cool.
[98:08.43]I like this.
[98:14.83]Moo.
[98:15.68]Yes.
[98:30.19]Fake SpongeBob fans.
[98:37.21]So wait, we're playing D&D right now?
[98:39.16]Is that what this is supposed to be?
[98:40.08]Hey there, Red.
[98:42.12]Alright.
[99:08.80]Let's see who truly is the strongest.
[99:10.10]Fucking cringe.
[99:14.44]What?
[99:17.04]Why did I just cringe?
[99:20.57]Wait!
[99:20.93]Wait, I wasn't ready?
[99:57.28]I could be hitting way more of these.
[100:05.53]Like that, there we go.
[100:06.29]Yeah, you gotta string it together.
[100:18.04]Cat, our streamer is bad.
[100:19.18]What?
[100:19.72]No, I'm not.
[100:22.32]I mean, I'm not great.
[100:23.28]I wouldn't say I'm very good good, but I think I'm okay.
[100:27.64]You got impressive moves.
[100:29.18]I have to practice harder if I'm going to beat the evil wizard before you.
[100:34.62]Let me handle it.
[100:35.40]I'm the one with the sword.
[100:36.06]Oh, no.
[100:42.47]Help me, Red.
[100:43.93]This game is too hard.
[100:45.83]I got attacked by squirrels.
[100:47.87]Could you help me?
[100:48.49]Thanks much.
[100:51.23]This time I will not fail.
[100:53.97]Oh.
[101:02.37]Oh, no.
[101:03.05]Get up.
[101:04.37]Wow, those squirrels don't give up.
[101:05.85]Can you help me up again?
[101:07.49]Thanks.
[101:10.05]This time I will not fail.
[101:17.23]Wow, don't give up.
[101:18.37]Can I have you help me?
[101:20.15]Thanks.
[101:22.07]Thanks for helping me.
[101:28.40]If he's dead, he's dead.
[101:29.06]Whatever.
[101:31.12]Enter my domain.
[101:33.22]I have been commanded to not let a soul pass this bridge.
[101:36.24]If you are to cross, prepare to pay with your life.
[101:38.78]Is this the wizard?
[101:42.01]No.
[101:42.07]I think it's about to get serious.
[101:57.19]Boys and girls, it's about to get serious.
[101:59.08]What was that?
[102:00.34]What the fuck is- Oh, it takes out the whole row.
[102:11.16]That's good.
[102:11.54]No.
[102:14.36]I like the song, though.
[102:22.61]It's really chill.
[102:46.54]See ya.
[102:46.78]You got some dank moves.
[102:48.10]With such great powers.
[102:50.19]I sure hope you're a good aligned character.
[102:52.63]I do that?
[103:18.35]The warrior had proven their skills twice.
[103:20.97]Their confidence was high, which would be needed.
[103:24.02]The Swamp of Chaos would challenge the warrior to their very core.
[103:29.80]Swamp of Chaos?
[103:30.66]Isn't a swamp level a bit cliche?
[103:32.50]What's next, the sewer level before the tower?
[103:37.76]No, it's actually the Badlands of Chaos.
[103:43.85]You don't have to change the entire level because, uh, Zig.
[103:46.44]No, it's fine.
[103:47.08]I was obviously kidding that there was a swamp level.
[103:49.22]This is better.
[103:50.50]Heh.
[104:05.25]The game's, like, glitching.
[104:06.03]Do you see that?
[104:14.99]What's this?
[104:15.27]Can I get rid of this stuff?
[104:25.36]Honestly, the graphics in this level are very ugly.
[104:28.04]Really looks unfinished.
[104:30.12]Well, that's what you get.
[104:32.08]Just saying, you can make it better.
[104:33.34]Day of the game.
[104:50.45]Is this fart music?
[104:55.50]I got to come forward in the chair.
[104:56.70]Here we go.
[105:01.88]Stop hitting me.
[105:03.96]Only if you give me all your items.
[105:07.28]Is that you?
[105:09.76]This is my custom-made mech character from Gear Assault.
[105:13.19]This fantasy game is way easier with a mech.
[105:16.74]I also noticed that attacking other players gives me more loot.
[105:20.78]This must be breaking several game rules.
[105:24.21]I'll have to check the rule book.
[105:26.39]Hold on.
[105:26.87]You don't play a good character, do you, Red?
[105:28.85]Uh-oh.
[105:31.39]In that case, Green, hand over all of your items or feel the wrath of Chaos Six.
[105:49.26]God.
[105:51.10]See, he's like scary looking.
[106:08.50]Alright, get it together.
[106:12.12]Get it together.
[107:09.75]This game is hard.
[107:12.04]I play a good guy, I lose.
[107:13.82]I play a bad guy, I lose.
[107:16.86]Here we go.
[107:17.32]I found the rule about PvP combat.
[107:19.80]Oh, I guess you guys solved it already.
[107:23.75]It was really not what we were concerned about.
[107:25.65]The show must go on, little one.
[107:33.37]How am I supposed to win when I keep losing?
[107:36.29]Muck keeps telling me failure is the progress that pays the road to success.
[107:41.59]To me, failure just seems like failure.
[107:45.77]I guess you just have to think of another way to win the game.
[107:48.10]I can't believe I was steamrolled by Flan.
[107:54.94]I should really retire.
[107:55.92]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[108:06.57]Secret?
[108:08.01]Nope.
[108:19.46]Don't skip.
[108:20.12]I didn't skip anything.
[108:23.98]Finally, at the foot of the tower, the lair of the evil wizard, will you be able to save the village from its ill fate?
[108:33.05]This is actually becoming quite exciting.
[108:35.15]You can do it, Red.
[108:37.15]I guess if anyone has a chance to win, it's you.
[108:40.00]If you defeat the evil wizard, we win the game.
[108:42.22]I am the cursed save point.
[108:53.53]There is a 50% chance that I'll delete your save.
[108:55.83]Lucky for you, I have several... You should have several save slots.
[108:59.61]Do you take your chances?
[109:00.73]Oh, my God.
[109:03.61]That actually scared me.
[109:04.71]Your save was deleted?
[109:07.50]Okay.
[109:08.98]Holy shit, is that real?
[109:13.34]But seriously, your game was saved.
[109:15.06]Okay.
[109:20.56]Scared me enough to do that.
[109:21.49]You got all this space back here.
[109:28.87]I'm assuming you're not going to use it?
[109:31.47]Really?
[109:31.65]Okay.
[109:38.33]Hmm.
[109:43.07]Ooh.
[110:11.34]You've come a long way, warrior.
[110:13.55]I see that you are armed.
[110:16.35]You are not the first they have sent to assassinate me.
[110:19.71]Isn't that right, Rasta Beast?
[110:26.93]The villagers just fear what they don't understand, you see.
[110:31.92]Don't listen to that evil wizard, Red.
[110:34.15]Oh, shut up, Rasta.
[110:35.65]I don't have time for this, and you heroes are bothering me.
[110:39.35]Your death will serve as an example for anyone that would even consider disturbing me.
[110:43.41]Alright.
[110:51.06]This is the big one right here.
[111:15.79]Oh, they're being blocked!
[111:37.35]Oi!
[111:53.45]You think you're fighting evil?
[111:57.87]You are so full of yourself.
[112:03.13]I am the one who hears God.
[112:19.23]How are you so strong?
[112:25.83]I can't believe I was beaten by a wooden doll wearing a metal bucket.
[112:29.77]One day I'll have my revenge.
[112:31.33]A lot of jump scares in this game.
[112:41.44]Thank you for saving me, Red.
[112:42.60]I wouldn't have made it if it wasn't for you.
[112:47.28]You fought valiantly.
[112:48.50]Let's go back to the village and tell them the good news.
[112:55.99]You beat him too fast, you skipped verse 2.
[112:58.25]Really?
[112:58.97]Oh shit.
[113:03.15]Now that the quest has come to an end... Red and Rasta Beast journeyed back to the village, silhouetted by a glorious sunset.
[113:14.44]No verse 2.
[113:17.10]Really?
[113:17.46]Oh, sorry.
[113:21.36]Once returned, they were received as heroes for defeating the evil wizard.
[113:29.09]plant opened up a bakery where they sold slimy muffins, which proved to be quite a success.
[113:38.68]Zig decided to make the tower their home, where Zig lived happily ever after, or at least for a long time.
[113:47.25]And Nosferatu... Wait, you weren't in the game at all!
[113:50.83]I wanted to roleplay as one of the mushrooms.
[113:55.89]No, Sperachu continued the unfruitful quest of trying to learn the secrets of their past.
[113:59.79]The end.
[114:10.06]Okay.
[114:10.98]Well, that was fun.
[114:11.72]So what did you guys think?
[114:14.64]That was a good session, Green Mage.
[114:16.24]Oh, I've played better.
[114:17.62]I enjoyed it, even if it was a bit hard.
[114:21.68]I guess this is it.
[114:25.60]Actually, your great efforts of saving the land of Medallion read... Puzzle piece.
[114:39.67]Take this tributary piece of wood as a reminder of this epic quest.
[114:44.54]Oh, wow.
[114:46.02]I'm sure it will come in handy.
[114:47.10]Cool.
[114:50.04]You picked up a piece of a door.
[114:52.12]Door piece.
[114:56.24]Very cool.
[114:58.64]Oh wait, it's open.
[114:59.26]Hey, what are you doing?
[115:03.32]That's private.
[115:04.66]The hatch is shut.
[115:05.65]You can't seem to get it open.
[115:06.69]What?
[115:06.91]Are you serious?
[115:07.83]Alright, for that just being one little section of this area, that was pretty crazy.
[115:20.46]That was one little house.
[115:21.50]There's so much more to do here.
[115:28.43]Oh boy.
[115:28.81]I'm not doing that yet.
[115:37.92]Hi there.
[115:39.60]I feel that I am destined to do great things in my life.
[115:42.84]Okay.
[115:44.50]I can go down.
[115:56.18]Ooh, what's that?
[115:57.86]Who's out there?
[115:58.40]If anyone is out there, it's kind of an emergency.
[116:02.98]Could you get some toilet paper?
[116:05.36]I'll reward you with a lava lamp for your troubles.
[116:07.28]Okay, toilet paper.
[116:10.30]Go to the shop.
[116:23.83]These flowers smell like an old person's breath.
[116:27.33]Like Sour Patch Kids and cigarettes.
[116:28.97]A rigidly locked chest.
[116:33.70]They smell like childhood.
[116:38.40]They smell like barbecue.
[116:44.56]These flowers smell like paper.
[116:45.80]They smell like dirt.
[116:52.37]They smell like skunky sweet.
[116:58.17]Wow.
[116:59.49]What is that clay pot you have?
[117:01.61]It would fit perfectly for something I had in mind.
[117:04.55]I will give you something valuable in return.
[117:07.07]Could I have the clay pot?
[117:09.55]Yes.
[117:13.85]This feels great.
[117:15.61]You can take my old hat.
[117:18.64]Trash can lid.
[117:22.99]You seem interested in that chest.
[117:25.09]You only, I'll tell.
[117:27.12]Only the brown mage can unlock the golden lock, so I've heard.
[117:29.72]Okay.
[117:34.70]I got a lid.
[117:35.28]What do I do with the lid now?
[117:45.93]Hi, small figure.
[117:47.67]I'm a stone guardian.
[117:48.65]Really like eat.
[117:50.17]But I no move.
[117:51.75]Oh, you have food.
[117:52.53]Can I has cake?
[117:54.87]Yes.
[117:55.85]Yum, yum, yum.
[117:56.59]Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
[117:59.45]Belch.
[117:59.91]This was a bad cake.
[118:01.31]Thanks for nothing.
[118:02.58]What?
[118:05.34]What do you mean?
[118:10.74]Pick up a hook.
[118:18.63]So I have a hook.
[118:20.55]I have a trash can lid.
[118:25.19]What beautiful metal thing is that?
[118:26.63]I would love to trade it.
[118:28.27]What do you want to trade?
[118:29.73]Yes.
[118:31.27]Wow, I look so cool.
[118:33.01]Here, take this.
[118:34.89]This nice stick.
[118:37.15]I feel like that's a bad trade.
[118:41.65]Pick up a nice stick.
[118:45.19]Okay.
[118:46.47]Stick, trash can lid.
[118:51.55]Is there a trash somewhere?
[118:57.19]Oh, right here.
[118:59.80]I need a roof for my home.
[119:01.70]Maybe I can give you some trash if you find me a roof.
[119:04.84]I do have some half-used toilet paper, if that would be useful.
[119:07.40]Hey, that thing right there would be great.
[119:10.30]Perfect.
[119:13.35]I'll trade you for the toilet paper, yes.
[119:14.73]Alright, cool.
[119:18.07]Wait, you're not getting my toilet- I need it too, haha.
[119:21.24]What?
[119:25.88]That's not fair.
[119:33.01]Ow, my hand.
[119:38.57]Dammit.
[120:03.78]Oh, cool.
[120:05.85]I like this one.
[120:35.19]Damn.
[120:35.59]They could get you at that end, huh?
[120:42.13]Is that it?
[120:47.57]Oh, what a bother.
[120:48.31]Fine, take the toilet paper, but I'm keeping the roof.
[120:53.31]Got the toilet paper.
[121:01.42]I need to be honest, you're really good at this game.
[121:03.20]You're crazy good at this game, am I?
[121:06.02]I find my calling.
[121:07.71]Who's out there?
[121:10.67]If anyone is out there, it's kind of an emergency.
[121:12.43]Yep, I got toilet paper.
[121:14.95]Just attach it to the hook and I will hoist it up.
[121:16.83]So what, you're going to give me the key to the chest, right?
[121:27.84]Ah, yes.
[121:30.04]Finally, I can wipe my table clean.
[121:33.72]Is assholes a table?
[121:36.73]Oh, right, I promised you something.
[121:37.95]A lava lamp, right?
[121:43.33]Oh no, I've got bad news.
[121:44.61]I seem to have lost it.
[121:45.57]If you bring me batteries, I promise to make something really, really unique and special.
[121:52.65]That's a super promise.
[121:54.28]You dick.
[121:56.38]Okay.
[122:00.70]Bring me batteries.
[122:03.07]Well, batteries.
[122:05.79]Batteries in the clock?
[122:06.39]I think I went every way I can here, right?
[122:13.67]I think that's it.
[122:22.07]Going down?
[122:25.56]Wait, hold on.
[122:27.14]Oh.
[122:30.16]Door's locked.
[122:31.82]What is that?
[122:35.27]Alright, well, I know I can go down.
[122:36.11]You can do it, Red.
[122:45.19]My wife is 350 pounds.
[122:46.85]Please help me.
[122:47.35]I don't know.
[122:49.89]What do you want me to do about it?
[122:50.65]What do you want me to do about it, man?
[122:59.05]Good luck with whatever you're doing.
[123:03.29]Okay, so I got- that was that door.
[123:05.94]We've been here.
[123:07.86]We've been here.
[123:10.66]Have I been- this is- okay, we've been here.
[123:12.48]This is the entrance, right?
[123:15.52]No, I don't want to leave yet.
[123:18.30]We've not gone in here.
[123:20.58]I hope you had a great time.
[123:21.65]Want to go back dancing?
[123:23.55]Wait, what?
[123:30.75]Have I gone in here?
[123:36.80]I've not gone in here.
[123:37.82]How much do I weigh?
[123:38.54]100 and like, I don't know, 150, 160?
[123:40.69]I just want to be someone.
[123:45.21]I wish I could leave this place someday.
[123:46.65]I haven't felt happy in such a long time.
[123:50.65]155?
[123:58.84]Um...
[124:07.05]I guess I can't do anything here.
[124:15.25]Okay.
[124:17.45]What was that all about?
[124:18.17]Uh.
[124:19.01]Okay.
[124:33.88]Okay.
[124:36.60]You should do a golfing stream.
[124:41.29]I'm not going to go golf.
[124:42.69]No, I don't.
[124:43.77]I'm bad.
[124:44.65]I can drive, but I can't do anything else.
[124:49.31]I can drive and I can putt.
[124:50.60]That's it.
[124:53.60]I would love to drive your ball for you.
[124:56.68]Wait till you chip it a million times and all the annoying, boring shit.
[124:59.78]So, like, I do the- I use the driver and I smash it.
[125:03.37]And then I just go in the golf cart and get to the green.
[125:06.03]I just drive to the green and wait for you.
[125:08.13]And you do all the shitty, boring golf suck stuff from the tee to the green.
[125:13.37]And then I take the putter and I putt.
[125:15.37]I do the fun stuff.
[125:21.86]Just tell Goldpig that you beat me up.
[125:23.18]I hope I can count on you saying the same.
[125:25.84]Yes.
[125:26.66]You're a cool guy.
[125:27.40]Alright, I've been... This is the first part, right?
[125:30.87]I was already here.
[125:37.01]I remember doing this.
[125:37.83]In the one hour that I played this game a couple weeks ago, I remember playing that part.
[125:48.15]This implies that I would let myself be within 200 feet of you.
[125:55.26]I don't understand.
[125:56.16]What do you think I'm going to do?
[126:00.16]Like start biting you?
[126:06.69]Door's locked.
[126:16.76]Did I go in here?
[126:17.50]I think I already did.
[126:18.26]Yeah, didn't I?
[126:19.42]This door seems broken.
[126:22.30]Oh, I have all the pieces to this door.
[126:23.84]Alright, let me save it.
[126:27.44]He's rabid.
[126:30.65]Why do people think that I'm going to see you?
[126:33.55]First of all, how am I going to know who you are?
[126:34.95]If we're just out in public somewhere and we're just doing something, I'm going to know that you're a chatter in my chat?
[126:42.32]Dude, if we're just at the grocery store, we're at the grocery store.
[126:45.32]I'm not going to ask everybody in the grocery store if they're a watcher of the channel, first of all.
[126:51.13]How am I going to know who you are?
[126:58.80]From the smell.
[126:59.54]Okay.
[127:06.40]Are you sure you want to go in this door?
[127:09.18]This journey is long and unforgiving.
[127:10.76]Do you still want to enter?
[127:11.90]Yes, of course I do.
[127:19.87]What the hell?
[127:20.71]This is cool.
[127:35.72]They're more like, oh, hey, Jerma!
[127:38.24]Hey, hey, hey!
[127:39.60]Hey there!
[127:41.04]Hey, just want to say, what is it?
[127:45.32]I'm a big fan, and when I hear the N in fan, I just grab your fucking arm and start... Why do you think that's going to happen?
[128:04.63]No, here's what's going to happen.
[128:05.65]Hey, Jerma!
[128:10.27]Hey, I'm a big fan.
[128:13.47]Oh, hey, cool, man.
[128:15.13]Really good to see you.
[128:16.93]That's awesome.
[128:17.83]That's so cool.
[128:20.08]Yeah, this is really fun.
[128:22.08]This is really cool.
[128:22.70]I can't believe somebody recognized me in public.
[128:24.38]That's insane.
[128:26.16]Yeah, dude, can I get a selfie?
[128:27.64]Of course you can.
[128:28.98]Of course you can.
[128:30.84]I'm going to need your credit card though.
[128:32.56]And I got my app here.
[128:34.96]It has tap.
[128:35.76]You can tap the phone.
[128:36.96]Like it's a little device I plug in.
[128:43.51]Yeah, sure.
[128:43.93]Absolutely.
[128:46.25]You got like a chip in your card, right?
[128:47.55]Yeah.
[128:59.42]And then he bites you.
[129:02.01]After you pay.
[129:02.81]No.
[129:03.57]Oh my god.
[129:09.28]Oh, here's.
[129:09.68]Oh, thanks, man.
[129:10.30]Yeah, that was $50.
[129:11.38]Oh, here's.
[129:11.82]Oh, selfie.
[129:12.42]Oh!
[129:21.65]I'm just a normal person, guys.
[129:23.25]I'm not like a rabid weirdo.
[129:25.25]If you come up to me and say, hey dude, how are you?
[129:27.56]I'm gonna be like, hey, what's up?
[129:28.84]It's really good to see you.
[129:30.96]I'm not like a psycho.
[129:32.10]I'm not gonna like... What are you talking about?
[129:33.96]Hey, red and blue.
[129:37.40]The knight is here.
[129:38.02]Sit down and relax.
[129:39.44]You still have a long walk ahead.
[129:52.19]Please don't bite me.
[129:52.97]I don't want to turn into a Jerma.
[129:58.08]Ay-yi-yi.
[129:59.20]I've been meaning to tell you, Red.
[130:00.74]This path will only lead to more torment.
[130:04.30]You have come this far, so I guess you've made up your mind.
[130:08.36]I'm afraid this will lead to more questions than answers.
[130:11.70]I fear something horrible might happen if you continue.
[130:16.94]Anyway, much has been said.
[130:18.04]It's time to hit the hay.
[130:18.90]Good night.
[130:25.15]Is it, like, a bite of a vampire or a zombie?
[130:29.99]Um... I don't know.
[130:33.49]Probably... Probably zombie, if I were to say.
[130:36.95]Because I don't have fangs, and I don't, like, drink blood or anything, so... A zombie is just kind of a person's mouth, and it's just kind of dirty with unbrushed teeth.
[130:47.28]I mean, right?
[130:48.72]That's the only difference.
[130:53.44]A bit embarrassing.
[130:56.60]I don't remember why we are here.
[130:57.84]What are we actually trying to do?
[131:01.40]I don't understand what we are doing.
[131:02.66]I feel like everyone is speaking in riddles.
[131:10.95]There's no clear indication to what's actually going on.
[131:13.71]You really think we should continue forward?
[131:15.37]I trust you.
[131:17.37]I just hope you know- What is going on with this fire?! !
[131:21.58]Somebody's just breaking styrofoam in the background.
[131:23.84]I can't even concentrate.
[131:25.54]I just hope you know what you're doing.
[131:32.95]Just wanted to say that I trust you.
[131:34.25]Good night.
[131:44.33]Tap dancing.
[131:45.87]Yeah, somebody's practicing above me in my apartment.
[131:57.67]Okay.
[132:00.69]That's not what fire sounds like.
[132:03.86]As good as a day can be, the road is clear.
[132:06.34]Good luck.
[132:10.80]That's the hamburger helper burning in the oven.
[132:14.13]You don't put a hamburger helper in the oven.
[132:23.33]In the oven.
[132:28.42]Ugh.
[132:32.44]It's the sap that's being ignited by the wood.
[132:34.60]Alright.
[132:39.25]That's actually kind of interesting.
[132:40.61]I actually didn't know that.
[132:41.77]So that's kind of cool.
[132:42.47]Thanks for the tip.
[132:44.11]Ooh, this is nice.
[133:00.76]This kind of reminds me of Outer Wilds.
[133:03.84]That one planet.
[133:05.02]Enough, buddy.
[133:06.60]Look, pal.
[133:07.54]I tried stopping you earlier, but you ignored it.
[133:11.36]We laughed and let it slide, but now I've really got to put my foot down and tell you, go back and stay out.
[133:18.64]And I won't hurt you.
[133:23.66]I see.
[133:24.26]So be it.
[133:25.28]Get ready for a beating, fella.
[133:26.60]I'm going to get struck by lightning.
[133:34.57]I'm serious.
[133:35.25]Go back.
[133:40.14]Come on, mate.
[133:40.88]Why are you going to be so stubborn?
[133:43.62]If you won't turn back, I'll be forced to take you down.
[133:46.32]Oh.
[133:51.56]Alright.
[133:52.64]You asked for it.
[133:54.11]I hate to do it.
[133:54.77]You're going to be real sorry.
[133:57.43]I shall unleash my fury upon you like the thunder of a thousand lightning storms.
[134:05.22]We got a big one coming up?
[134:06.28]A good song?
[134:08.86]What am I doing?
[134:11.42]Why would this work the second time?
[134:16.21]Alright, hear me out.
[134:17.65]If Gold Pig asks, please, just say that I fought valiantly.
[134:23.49]Displayed great acts of heroism and all that jazz.
[134:26.55]I won't waste any more of your time.
[134:31.74]I will.
[134:31.98]Don't worry, I will.
[134:40.55]What was that?
[134:42.69]A car?
[134:43.23]Hmm.
[134:43.75]Hello?
[135:04.42]broken car there are batteries next to the engine do you want to pick up the yes I do hey you picked up the batteries he's mad this is a car battle
[135:38.12]Go back, turn around.
[135:39.90]I'm not going all the way back that way.
[135:41.74]That's a ten minute walk.
[135:44.56]I'm gonna get teleported to that hub world anyways.
[135:58.59]Big gate stands ahead.
[136:01.43]Do you want to open the gate?
[136:03.73]Yes.
[136:11.63]What do we got?
[136:12.05]Save.
[136:19.24]Oh, you walked the entire way to the old desert temple.
[136:21.34]Not many visitors come to these parts.
[136:23.06]It's good to have multiple saves.
[136:24.36]Who knows what might happen.
[136:25.28]Nice.
[136:31.01]Good luck with whatever you're doing.
[136:38.11]Look who finally stumbled in.
[136:40.92]You just won't give a... As much as I... I must say, I admire it.
[136:47.72]Chasing... Like this.
[136:50.22]At the edge of the mountain.
[136:52.48]Lucky for you, I have prepared a welcoming party.
[136:56.64]Perfect.
[136:57.25]What I do... What I pay you to do.
[137:03.17]Hello, Red.
[137:07.39]I cannot let you continue down this path.
[137:10.01]Leave now.
[137:14.56]I will kill you if you don't.
[137:15.76]I... I'm not a very good actor.
[137:21.02]I'm not a good actor!
[137:21.96]I'm not a good actor!
[137:32.73]Seems that you didn't understand what I meant when I told you to leave.
[137:37.11]I regret disobeying my command.
[137:44.87]This is a Zumbini.
[137:47.47]I feel pain.
[137:49.47]I've resurrected you from the dead.
[137:50.91]You are to follow my orders until I release you.
[137:55.99]What is it you ask of me?
[137:58.27]I want you to disable the red one.
[138:07.75]I have something funny to cut and write.
[138:09.07]What's wrong?
[138:09.77]Alright.
[138:11.67]Alright.
[138:12.61]Let's get down to business.
[138:14.39]You want to pass Dolly?
[138:16.03]That ain't happening.
[138:17.49]Amigo, you heard what I, the mage, said.
[138:20.17]I'm going to mess you up real bad.
[138:22.11]Do I still have the sword?
[138:32.36]Nope.
[138:59.47]Who made all the music for this?
[139:00.73]That's awesome.
[139:44.43]It was Kevin MacLeod.
[139:45.44]It was not Kevin MacLeod.
[139:51.94]It's not Kevin MacLeod.
[139:55.00]It was.
[139:55.48]No, it was not Kevin MacLeod.
[139:57.10]I'm guaranteeing that.
[139:59.64]Kevin MacLeod is a talented guy.
[140:01.33]Made a bunch of great songs for all of us YouTubers.
[140:05.77]I don't think they had anything to do with this.
[140:10.03]It's impossible.
[140:10.69]Purple, I can't do it.
[140:13.23]Yes, I see.
[140:15.25]I did not expect you to be victorious.
[140:20.51]I expected you to die.
[140:21.43]I can't believe I was being used like that.
[140:27.64]This isn't the first time Purple put me in a rotting corpse.
[140:31.12]I could at least have been for something important.
[140:35.58]Those mages, I don't like them.
[140:37.60]I don't like them.
[140:57.54]I know your secret now.
[140:59.28]A tactic that lets you win.
[141:01.73]I found you.
[141:03.53]I am Rob, former world champion.
[141:05.47]Raised from the dead.
[141:07.07]Out to fulfill my deed with my bro, Zom.
[141:09.89]But where is that guy?
[141:11.01]Ah, your green zombie friend there.
[141:14.84]Down the hall.
[141:16.44]Oh snap, that slacker knows what he's got a job to do.
[141:19.16]Whoa, whoa, wait.
[141:21.04]Hold on there, I recognize your voice.
[141:22.88]You're the one that summoned me.
[141:26.01]Oh, I see.
[141:26.55]You're part of the binding contract.
[141:30.11]Seems I've summoned two entities, I guess.
[141:33.43]Sure seems like it, bro!
[141:34.29]This guy's loud.
[141:37.43]What do you want me to do, boss?
[141:39.84]Well, since you're here... Yeah?
[141:43.92]If you defeat it, I will release you from your bind.
[141:47.58]Okay, bro.
[141:48.86]I'll be a piece of cake.
[141:50.42]Hey!
[141:51.24]You're going to... Yeah, I'm going to... Yeah.
[141:56.53]Who's louder, me or them?
[141:58.83]It's definitely me.
[142:00.15]It's definitely me.
[142:01.71]I'm way fucking louder than this guy.
[142:08.21]It's not me.
[142:10.05]It's not me.
[142:10.67]Holy shit.
[142:26.01]Oh god.
[142:26.59]It's distracting.
[142:30.97]You play good.
[142:40.07]No!
[142:46.51]Not sure I can take them down, bro!
[142:50.33]I didn't expect you to.
[142:52.07]I expected you to die.
[142:53.88]Nothing has changed, Red.
[143:01.07]Hey, it's me again.
[143:01.89]Thought I would make things easier for you.
[143:07.51]It is good to have multiple saves.
[143:10.09]Who knows what might happen.
[143:11.05]Do you want to save?
[143:11.73]Yes.
[143:15.63]Nice.
[143:16.03]Good luck with whatever you're doing.
[143:17.11]Alright.
[143:21.78]Alright.
[143:22.24]Alright.
[143:22.64]Okay.
[143:23.30]I don't... Whatever.
[143:24.38]Just look up on the Wikipedia for this game what he said.
[143:34.90]Hey, my wife is 400 pounds.
[143:36.16]I don't care how heavy your wife is.
[143:38.13]I don't care how heavy you are.
[143:39.15]I don't care.
[143:39.73]You're just prancing around in the same spot.
[143:43.23]I'm surprised you even got this far.
[143:46.93]The dead may not be able to stop you.
[143:49.52]Living seem unable to do as well.
[143:54.82]But I will not let you continue.
[143:56.14]We'll end your journey.
[144:07.32]This probably seems like a major boss fight here.
[144:08.88]Oh boy.
[144:43.52]I can't get hit there.
[145:04.22]Thank you.
[145:56.48]Why don't they play this kind of shit at the club?
[145:58.06]I would go.
[145:58.54]It's getting quieter.
[146:17.15]This is freaking me out.
[146:22.10]What happened?
[146:24.42]they do they do they do this in Germany hold on dude I find that I like a certain genre of like Jerma club music and I didn't even know impressive I won't be able to stop you understand that I did what I had to do let your choices be merciful
[146:52.46]It's literally just EDM.
[146:53.98]But is it like Jerma EDM?
[146:55.68]Or is there a difference?
[147:04.59]It's just standard.
[147:12.76]It's techno.
[147:16.00]You missed a door?
[147:16.81]I didn't.
[147:27.54]Oh.
[147:32.67]There is a door right here.
[147:34.73]You're right.
[147:38.95]What kind of music do you hear at clubs?
[147:43.58]I don't know.
[147:44.00]What's this?
[147:51.65]It's been a long time since we arrived in what some call Everhood.
[147:55.79]So many years have passed that I've almost forgotten some of us were once humans.
[148:00.95]So I thought I would write our history before time fades away.
[148:03.67]Time fade away our memories.
[148:08.87]A long time ago, before we found the rift that would enable us to transport to this realm of the immortals.
[148:15.98]When we were a society of millions, and a small selection of us had the privilege to belong to the, almost said, intestines, we had many debates on how to share this gift, this newfound miracle.
[148:29.73]Should we open it for everyone, or should only a few be allowed to visit such a place?
[148:35.39]We decided it had been far too long that we had kept this gift to ourselves.
[148:39.53]In the end, we determined we should allow everyone to meet the entities.
[148:45.76]The masses were elated.
[148:46.90]A great majority decided to become immortals, while only a few would remain as mortals.
[148:51.63]Such as the old, the sick, and unfortunate ones with reasons of their own.
[148:58.15]You could experience the most euphoric moments of your life, then completely forgot they ever had happened over and over again.
[149:05.89]I still have fond memories of using the earthquake machine during my dance-off battles with Pink Mage.
[149:11.40]They were one of a kind, and I truly miss them.
[149:17.91]Brown Mage.
[149:23.89]Okay.
[149:35.10]Are we in the metaverse?
[149:38.44]No.
[149:43.02]Go back.
[149:43.69]Go to talk to Brown Mage.
[149:45.27]Can I get there from here?
[149:51.62]I don't think I can get all the way back there.
[149:54.02]No, I know.
[149:54.56]I'm not listening to that one guy.
[150:07.24]This game's sick.
[150:08.22]This is a really good game.
[150:10.36]Now I understand why everybody wanted me to finish it.
[150:12.49]It's very, very good.
[150:13.75]It's very fun.
[150:20.11]You need to do the Schrodinger stream.
[150:23.44]What?
[150:24.40]What's Schrodinger stream?
[150:34.74]Seems you're unbeatable after all.
[150:36.54]I assume now you feel entitled to have your honor.
[150:40.22]I will have you taken.
[150:42.52]That's why.
[150:43.76]You are not taken from my cold, dead hands.
[150:46.92]I will end you.
[150:53.07]Let's go.
[150:53.41]Final boss.
[150:56.73]Maybe.
[150:58.21]Watch it.
[151:26.81]Easy.
[151:27.31]Get your text out of the way.
[151:28.31]I can't see.
[151:28.75]You're blocking my view.
[151:58.69]Through the fog.
[152:01.21]Why did I walk into that?
[152:46.27]You gotta get- You gotta get the blood flowing, see what I mean?
[153:01.63]Whoa!
[153:03.71]How do I get- How do I dodge that?
[153:16.98]Alright, fight him!
[153:17.96]Shoot him!
[153:46.46]That's not it.
[153:47.40]I'm prepared.
[153:47.76]Typical of you to dodge my attacks.
[154:00.68]Why do you keep challenging Red when you know you always lose, Goldpig?
[154:04.01]What do you mean?
[154:05.83]Don't tell me you've forgotten.
[154:08.09]Seems you don't remember Red's other side, Blue.
[154:17.40]Always being a pawn in someone else's scheme, little gnome.
[154:22.28]Doll has been using you all along to get his arm back.
[154:26.67]Wait, what?
[154:28.83]What?
[154:29.93]Didn't know, or forgot.
[154:33.01]You scattered brain twerp.
[154:34.83]I noticed you kept forgetting things.
[154:37.79]It was just a matter of time before you turned completely useless.
[154:42.10]That's why I took your legs.
[154:44.66]You don't need those.
[154:46.69]My legs?
[154:47.83]You stole my legs?
[154:54.21]You stole Blue's legs?
[154:56.65]You let your greed control your actions again, Gold Pig?
[155:00.34]Why would you even take Blue's legs?
[155:03.46]Nothing may be useful as toothpicks.
[155:06.80]You give me my toothpicks back.
[155:08.80]I mean my legs.
[155:09.92]Give me back my legs.
[155:12.80]You should return the legs.
[155:15.58]Oh, sweet.
[155:16.12]They don't deserve to have anything.
[155:18.86]Give back the legs, you hoarder.
[155:21.66]Fine.
[155:22.24]Fine.
[155:31.66]So I'm Red Mage, and that's Blue Mage, and that's Green Mage, and that's Purple Mage.
[155:36.17]So we're all like, we all know each other.
[155:38.05]We're all friends.
[155:40.07]Oh.
[155:42.42]I can finally walk again.
[155:43.38]I guess I don't need your help anymore.
[155:51.39]Thanks for helping me.
[155:53.99]Now, where's Red's arm?
[155:58.31]I think you'd better spill the beans, gold pig.
[156:01.83]These guys don't give up.
[156:02.87]That's what you want, right?
[156:05.96]Your precious little arm?
[156:09.06]It is no use to try and hide it any longer.
[156:13.84]I keep it in the treasury.
[156:15.52]Go and get it and then buzz off.
[156:21.89]Okay.
[156:21.99]There's going to be a trap.
[156:27.29]They're going to lock me in like a cell.
[156:32.45]I know it.
[156:35.71]There's a trap.
[156:36.23]It has to be.
[156:50.37]Oh, look, these are all our friends.
[156:54.44]We know, these are all the friends we made along the way here.
[156:56.44]Remember the door?
[156:59.14]Remember the fish?
[156:59.78]Remember the goblin?
[157:02.16]Remember Dr. Robotnik?
[157:04.20]Make a second save.
[157:05.48]Multiple saves.
[157:06.18]Hurry.
[157:06.54]Save.
[157:06.84]Save.
[157:07.12]Two saves.
[157:07.87]What?
[157:08.15]What?
[157:09.27]Why?
[157:10.45]Make a new save.
[157:11.71]Why am I making a new save?
[157:23.17]Okay.
[157:27.17]Make a third save.
[157:29.64]I'm not doing two.
[157:30.24]I'm not.
[157:30.50]I'm doing two saves.
[157:31.30]I'm not.
[157:31.66]I don't.
[157:32.04]No.
[157:32.14]There's my arm.
[157:43.59]You want to pick up the arm.
[157:48.95]Leave you scram.
[157:50.55]Don't be sure.
[157:54.03]Yes.
[157:55.09]You picked up your arm.
[158:07.46]What?
[158:15.00]No, this is bullshit.
[158:16.56]This is a fake end.
[158:17.73]Yeah, it's a fake ending.
[158:24.66]It's a fake ending.
[158:28.78]I can smell it from a mile away.
[158:30.28]It's a fake ending.
[158:45.01]Seems as if the doll has finally found its arm.
[158:49.50]You have proven yourself more than worthy to get your arm back.
[158:54.35]Now that you have seen what remains of this world, the ones in this world are trapped here in this realm.
[159:01.93]They have lived for many, many, many, many eons.
[159:10.30]Searching for a release, for a purpose, for a meaning.
[159:14.38]I just freaked out.
[159:16.78]People said the voice is bad.
[159:18.48]I must ask of you a huge favor.
[159:21.04]Help free us from this eternal wandering.
[159:24.21]You must find extraordinary courage and determination.
[159:28.42]As this will be an immense challenge.
[159:30.92]To end this world.
[159:35.76]We'll show you how to free souls with your arm.
[159:38.80]Bury yourself.
[159:40.90]Human.
[159:41.48]Uh-oh.
[159:43.11]Oh, this is a real boss.
[159:46.17]Oh, we gotta lock in on this one.
[159:49.99]He's in closely now.
[159:57.54]Reflect my attacks.
[160:05.86]Whoa.
[160:07.02]This is a whole new game.
[160:09.38]It's loud.
[160:12.61]So you gotta get three notes of the same color in a row.
[160:37.80]Shit.
[160:38.18]Oh, this makes it harder.
[160:44.98]This makes it really hard.
[160:48.84]You just need two notes of the same color?
[161:08.56]And now free souls.
[161:12.35]It's only two notes.
[161:14.91]Two, then X to fire.
[161:16.25]Oh, shit.
[161:16.73]Okay, I thought I had to... Alright.
[161:18.83]It'll be a challenging mission, but you do not stand alone.
[161:21.11]You're our key, our champion.
[161:22.85]To free us from the shackles of immortality.
[161:25.73]Seek out the spirits if you are in doubt.
[161:27.37]Alright.
[161:30.22]Let's go.
[161:32.58]Am I about to go free these motherfuckers over here?
[161:51.89]Interact or kill.
[161:53.22]What?
[161:55.32]You wanna... Yeah, I wanna save.
[161:57.86]What?
[162:03.26]Why would I kill the save point?
[162:09.97]Great, good luck.
[162:10.57]What if I kill this?
[162:12.51]What happens?
[162:14.19]I understand.
[162:14.61]Oh!
[162:14.73]Did I free him?
[162:33.88]Okay.
[162:57.71]So they're all running from me now?
[162:59.05]I'm gonna head back to the cosmic hub.
[163:01.76]Oh wait, I'm about to go on... I'm about to go kill everybody?
[163:08.16]I'm gonna... Oh no.
[163:23.08]Don't kill the hub save point for obvious reasons.
[163:28.06]Alright, when we go to like the circus, the carnival.
[163:36.01]So wait a minute.
[163:46.65]What do you want to do?
[163:47.43]What's the point of learning new skills?
[163:52.90]What do I, what do I do?
[163:58.41]Hey, what's with the attitude?
[163:59.61]What are you doing?
[164:00.13]I thought we were going to have a dance-off.
[164:06.87]I thought we were going to have a dance-off.
[164:08.45]I thought we were going to have like a dance-off party thing.
[164:10.88]I don't want to kill everybody.
[164:16.76]I thought it was like, oh, I can like grab the different colors and fire it back.
[164:20.64]I can just kill people?
[164:27.82]Hi there, Red.
[164:28.40]The cart race is closed.
[164:31.04]Do I have to?
[164:32.02]I didn't want to kill that person.
[164:40.13]It's releasing them.
[164:41.03]You're freeing them.
[164:41.87]Time to stamp home.
[164:47.57]Goodbye.
[164:47.99]This feels bad.
[164:53.10]They're immortal.
[164:54.38]There's 28 more people.
[164:55.96]Wait, I have to wipe everybody out?
[165:10.33]You can go pacifist if you want.
[165:11.91]I mean, what do I do?
[165:13.41]Let's see what kind of wood you're made of.
[165:17.47]Oh shit, I can't just kill this guy.
[165:18.83]This guy's fighting back.
[165:32.64]Oi!
[165:33.68]Oi!
[165:42.13]Fuck!
[165:57.88]Of course, right when I change from yellow to green!
[166:05.83]Can I just tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-tap?
[166:06.95]I'm gonna try it.
[166:13.54]Watch this, ready?
[166:14.08]Fuck you.
[166:25.87]Ready?
[166:26.17]Ready?
[166:28.11]Nope, that didn't work.
[166:28.87]That didn't do anything.
[167:07.51]What?
[167:09.29]Wait, I didn't kill him.
[167:12.29]Oh, not so easy to kill a vampire, is it?
[167:14.13]Oh, I got it.
[167:15.93]Alright.
[167:20.06]I got you.
[167:20.70]You got to do it before the song ends.
[167:21.90]This is awesome.
[167:23.88]This game just got like five times cooler right now.
[167:26.67]It just did.
[167:50.66]Shit, you idiot!
[167:51.68]YOU IDIOT!
[167:54.52]Blacks.
[168:24.27]Can I block these?
[168:41.26]Oh, I can, I can, I can, I can, I can, I can block those.
[168:44.36]I didn't think I could block those.
[168:52.53]YOU FUCKIN' IDIOTS, DON'T FLUNK!
[168:54.33]Get outta here!
[169:21.16]Oh, you hit hard for looking like a pair of sticks.
[169:23.36]Before I go, let the world know.
[169:27.04]Let the world know what?
[169:33.34]That I, Disco Jimmy, live to the fullest.
[169:36.04]It's time for me to perform my final disappearing act.
[169:55.22]Hey, no need to be so hostile.
[169:56.73]Let me just go get a thing.
[169:57.83]Is he done?
[170:01.42]Sucker.
[170:03.54]Wait, what?
[170:04.28]Is he hiding?
[170:17.98]You don't have to kill them all.
[170:18.86]There are two routes.
[170:19.62]You locked yourself after murdering the save point.
[170:22.64]Oh, shit.
[170:24.46]If you want to see this ending, you can keep going.
[170:25.86]But if you want to change your mind, you can load the save before you kill the lamp post.
[170:30.79]Shit.
[170:32.11]Well, we're already doing this one.
[170:33.33]I'll do this one.
[170:36.41]I figured there was probably... I didn't have to kill everybody.
[170:39.33]But, I mean, I want to see what happens.
[170:54.14]How do I get out of here?
[170:58.94]Oh.
[171:02.50]Oh wait, there's a sign in there.
[171:03.85]Oh, there is a sign.
[171:04.51]You're right.
[171:04.79]Do I have to kill everything?
[171:12.47]Sign?
[171:12.91]Use magic 8-ball.
[171:17.01]It will help in your mission.
[171:18.90]What is your obsession with me?
[171:22.91]They were so cool for vandalizing a sign.
[171:24.83]A true rebel.
[171:32.96]26.
[171:35.04]But what about the robot?
[171:35.98]The robot hid behind the booth.
[171:41.24]I didn't, uh, I didn't kill the robot.
[171:56.19]Let me see, there's actually four endings.
[171:57.81]That's cool.
[171:58.57]If you stand still, the game will give you a guide on who you have to kill.
[172:14.20]Really?
[172:14.42]Oh, it's a lie.
[172:24.43]Okay.
[172:26.43]Do the right thing and save them.
[172:35.72]Wait.
[172:36.36]That means I have to kill all the mushrooms.
[172:37.80]I like the mushrooms.
[172:42.70]But I'm not killing them.
[172:43.98]I'm freeing them from the immortal world where we're all stuck here.
[172:47.61]Right?
[172:47.77]Or is that just the narrative I'm putting in my head?
[172:58.24]I kill this thing?
[173:25.67]Look, everyone's having a good time here.
[173:26.87]What about you?
[173:27.47]Can I... I'm the Guardian of the Mushroom Forest.
[173:30.01]Oh yes, here it is.
[173:30.95]The Reaper of Souls.
[173:32.77]I've been looking forward to speaking with you.
[173:34.19]Have you come for my guidance or for my soul?
[173:37.68]Let me... I'll get... You can say some words first.
[173:39.96]Put it simply, life is suffering.
[173:43.78]The living fear death until it's too late.
[173:46.22]That is how the mind works.
[173:48.32]But when life does not have a time span, becoming immortal is more of a curse than a blessing.
[173:54.83]It is torture for the soul.
[173:56.37]There's nothing to do with all this time.
[174:00.57]After thousands of years, you become docile.
[174:03.09]You become mute.
[174:04.45]There are so few things you can do in a physical form.
[174:07.73]It's almost like a cruel joke.
[174:09.74]You must take great strides to realize what must be done.
[174:13.30]You understand what I'm saying?
[174:14.62]You understand that I want to die?
[174:17.08]Um...
[174:22.25]I guess.
[174:23.51]Good, good.
[174:24.73]Do you have what it takes to finish the quest?
[174:27.47]I don't know.
[174:27.89]Like, maybe.
[174:30.97]No?
[174:32.33]Yes.
[174:33.39]The weight of the world is in your shoulders.
[174:35.57]No one should be forced to bear such a burden.
[174:37.95]You're the only one that can end this torture.
[174:40.71]Now, shall we battle?
[174:44.58]Yeah.
[174:47.64]We shall.
[175:01.15]Yes, just like that.
[175:31.36]HENDERY!
[175:41.53]Ding ding ding ding ding ding, ding ding ding ding ding ding.
[175:46.66]Shit.
[176:26.33]That was tricky.
[176:30.03]Well done.
[176:31.49]You performed admirably.
[176:32.83]A true liberator, finally.
[176:35.99]You will be received as a true champion when you reach the end.
[176:40.56]Farewell.
[176:41.80]Bye.
[176:46.80]Everybody around here see that?
[176:50.69]They kind of look, they look kind of sad.
[176:52.53]Are you alright?
[176:55.33]Wow, you found all of us.
[177:00.43]Oh, what a twist that you would be the one who had such power.
[177:03.96]Life sure is full of surprises.
[177:06.38]So long for now.
[177:14.76]I don't want to get rid of them all.
[177:16.08]I like these guys.
[177:19.80]I like this guy.
[177:20.92]I like this guy the most.
[177:22.00]I don't want to get rid of him.
[177:26.08]You found us, yay!
[177:27.20]There comes a time for us all.
[177:37.25]You have to free them, they're suffering.
[177:41.03]Death is temporary.
[177:42.89]Life is eternal.
[177:43.99]There's nothing to be afraid of.
[177:53.88]Oh god!
[177:59.30]He looks concerned.
[178:00.28]I don't think he... Here comes the susu-sisu for us all.
[178:15.87]Nothing to be afraid of.
[178:23.46]Don't miss the point of the whole thing.
[178:25.48]This is a musical thing.
[178:27.28]We are supposed to dance, sing, and enjoy ourselves.
[178:35.15]Hi.
[178:35.43]Hey, little guy.
[178:38.95]What are you doing?
[178:40.75]Nothing, just coming over to say hi to you.
[178:42.80]And check on you, make sure you're doing okay.
[178:45.76]I'm doing good, I'm doing very good.
[178:51.74]Are you struggling?
[178:52.93]Are you sure of your actions?
[178:54.51]You can't kill me in a way that matters.
[179:07.75]What the fuck, man?
[179:09.19]It's not my- I'm freeing them from the immortal torture.
[179:16.18]Wait, the little worm guy.
[179:19.60]Get her alive, for me it doesn't matter.
[179:22.12]I can let you kill me without a battle.
[179:24.32]Would you prefer a fight?
[179:26.32]Do you want to battle?
[179:28.56]Yeah.
[179:29.61]I do.
[179:39.73]You're slaughtering everybody one by one.
[179:42.85]Well...
[180:03.25]Oh yeah, this guy does the weird shit.
[180:05.20]Shit!
[180:44.58]Hello, human!
[180:45.44]Oh, he won!
[180:46.08]No, he didn't.
[180:46.56]I have green right now.
[181:16.07]Got it.
[181:27.93]Why is Gerber so cracked at this game?
[181:29.59]I don't know, I just... I told you, give me four buttons and I'll win.
[181:39.30]That was fun, I admit defeat.
[181:41.92]See you on the other side.
[181:47.16]Are you still on hard mode?
[181:48.08]Yeah.
[181:48.22]I haven't changed the difficulty or anything.
[181:54.74]I have no idea what extreme would be like.
[181:56.32]Alright, is anybody still here?
[181:59.84]Or did I free everybody?
[182:10.94]Is this somebody?
[182:11.46]The tree has a face.
[182:19.98]I think your brain might be just wired to be funky.
[182:22.56]I don't know.
[182:31.20]The people in the lab.
[182:32.11]Oh, that's right.
[182:37.23]Where's the lab?
[182:41.05]Isn't it up here?
[182:51.84]If you crank it up to extreme, it should be fine.
[182:53.62]It's not that much harder, to be honest.
[182:56.12]Hmm, maybe... Once I learned you got your arm back, I reconfigured this entire lab into an impenetrable death fortress.
[183:05.69]You're never going to catch me, bloodthirsty marauder.
[183:08.59]Rundown?
[183:09.69]Make sure to set all traps to full power.
[183:12.53]Hurry, you doofus.
[183:33.61]Just gotta do it to the beat, that's it.
[184:05.53]No!
[184:06.13]Did you just turn it down?
[184:12.77]You fucked up.
[184:13.71]Alright, I'll turn it back up.
[184:14.72]It looked like it was too loud.
[184:15.78]I'm sorry.
[184:16.16]I'll turn it back up.
[184:43.15]Alright, I'm fine.
[184:59.70]I need to go this way.
[185:00.80]I need to go over here.
[185:03.80]I need to double.
[185:04.48]Where is it?
[185:05.52]I'm fine.
[185:10.67]Oh my god, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[185:17.62]I have to turn it down in my head.
[185:18.68]Oh, I have to do the whole thing again.
[185:20.22]God damn it.
[185:21.10]Oh my god, I hate this.
[185:27.27]I just want to skip it.
[185:28.21]I hate trap stuff.
[185:35.93]I have no patience.
[185:44.67]I was getting murdered.
[185:53.73]I don't, I don't, I can't do it.
[185:56.05]I'm going right down the middle.
[185:56.93]One, two, three, go.
[186:13.91]I hate it.
[186:14.37]Okay, so I have to wait until it crosses each other.
[186:17.61]One, two, go.
[186:21.44]Oh my god, don't even do this to me.
[186:23.64]Alright, so I have to start at the bottom.
[186:25.42]Just walk with it, just walk with it, just walk with it.
[186:42.65]Oh, shit.
[186:43.11]What does this mean?
[186:43.87]Can I touch these?
[186:49.11]Oh, fuck!
[186:49.98]Oh, fuck!
[186:50.92]Oh, fuck!
[186:52.02]Oh, fuck!
[186:52.60]I'm fine.
[186:53.54]Alright, we're good.
[187:02.26]I can't believe it.
[187:03.57]How is it possible you got through all those traps?
[187:05.41]Grunt help!
[187:06.83]I command you to attack that red marauder.
[187:18.53]Alright, we're ready to kill.
[188:13.81]God damn it!
[188:14.31]Come on!
[188:22.97]More volume?
[188:29.22]Farewell.
[188:32.14]But that's a soul, right?
[188:33.02]25.
[188:33.08]Alright, don't move.
[188:36.58]I'm just gonna save the game.
[188:48.48]Go to extreme difficulty?
[188:55.98]I don't think I can.
[188:56.74]Can I?
[188:59.23]Makes winning feel good, you will die.
[189:01.83]Less health regeneration for people who like hard challenges.
[189:04.43]You think I can handle it?
[189:06.83]I'll try it this once.
[189:08.99]If I can't do it, if I'm not confident on this, doing it once or twice, then yeah, I'll try.
[189:12.41]I'll try extreme.
[189:17.69]Seems my luck has run out.
[189:21.11]I don't blame you.
[189:22.37]I did try to eliminate you.
[189:23.45]There's no point in hiding myself from me now.
[189:27.10]This inevitable death is upon me.
[189:28.70]That didn't even... didn't even get a chance.
[189:33.36]He had two souls in his head?
[189:38.74]Dear Orange,
[189:45.21]It started out as a minor inconvenience, as it mostly does.
[189:47.89]Through years and years and years of endless enjoyment, our physical bodies were simply not keeping up with what our minds desired.
[189:56.86]Not a sense of sickness or pain, none of that existed.
[189:59.38]But through sheer exhaustion, our bodies from our primordial worlds were not adapted to the freedom of our new home.
[190:08.26]This, of course, wasn't the case for every inhabitant, but as a former human, it certainly was for me.
[190:16.92]You don't have to do this to yourself.
[190:17.96]Don't let chat peer pressure you.
[190:19.22]No, I know.
[190:20.60]If it's too much for me, I'm just going right back to hard.
[190:22.95]And I will not care at all.
[190:25.77]Sometimes games go from hard to extreme, and extreme is, like, impossible.
[190:28.99]So, don't worry.
[190:32.85]We usually found quick solutions such as potions, surgery, and artificial limbs.
[190:37.50]But our demands grew more ambitious, and we continued to evolve ourselves.
[190:41.30]All in the name of making our existence as joyful as possible.
[190:44.90]Our ways became twisted.
[190:45.88]We felt the urge to play pranks on each other.
[190:48.30]Throwing both friends and foes into pits of eternal hell.
[190:51.59]Over and over just to experience the days and months.
[190:55.95]In this insane indulgence, this cruel and twisted nightmare, inhabitants started to disappear altogether.
[191:03.55]I suspect they found a way to end their immortality.
[191:06.92]Brown mage.
[191:09.14]We're just like pranking each other by killing each other?
[191:12.22]Just to like know that time passed?
[191:15.63]That's kind of fucked up.
[191:24.17]Oh!
[191:24.89]This person.
[191:28.29]What do you want to do?
[191:30.61]They're everywhere.
[191:31.27]What do they want?
[191:31.69]What do they want?
[191:32.15]Leave me be.
[191:32.67]I don't want to.
[191:33.31]Make it stop.
[191:33.83]Make it stop.
[191:34.21]Make it stop.
[191:34.59]Make it stop.
[191:36.39]What are you doing?
[191:38.45]What are you doing?
[191:46.92]I'm just, I'm freeing you.
[191:55.51]Okay.
[192:01.61]That was upsetting.
[192:05.05]Back to the entrance, yes.
[192:07.63]Kill the save.
[192:08.31]I don't think the save points have a soul.
[192:19.40]They don't.
[192:20.10]Okay.
[192:20.32]I think that's everybody in the forest.
[192:31.45]I believe that's everybody.
[192:46.24]Interact with the ball.
[192:48.76]You shake the magic eight ball, it says, Zig is relaxing in the dance club in a bad mood.
[192:53.91]Oh, it tells you where to go.
[192:55.15]Okay.
[193:05.37]How the hell do I get out of here?
[193:12.91]How do I get out of here?
[193:19.15]I'm a save point and I have a soul.
[193:20.57]How do I get out of here?
[193:24.71]Wait, what's that?
[193:25.27]I can open that door?
[193:28.20]Eventually?
[193:34.99]Get me out of here.
[193:46.91]Use the door?
[193:47.41]It's to the right of the lab.
[193:49.41]I went the complete wrong way then.
[193:50.82]Talk to the spirits?
[194:24.34]Why the fuck do you eat cauliflower with mustard?
[194:26.62]Why do you think I do that?
[194:28.82]Who told you I did that?
[194:29.72]I don't... I don't... Is there something wrong with that?
[194:40.53]They never were truly alive.
[194:50.38]The mushrooms were never alive.
[194:56.94]Where was the type of guy to watch anime intro openings and complain that that's not what's put on the radio?
[195:10.79]This door is locked.
[195:23.61]What's going on in here?
[195:26.39]What's going on in here?
[195:27.84]It's a vicious insult.
[195:37.51]I mean, is it an insult if it's not even real?
[195:47.34]Okay, that's like you saying to me, Oh, Jerma man.
[195:52.40]Like, God, imagine being the guy that likes putting fucking mustard on cauliflower.
[195:57.77]I've never eaten that before in my life, right?
[195:59.89]Like, that doesn't insult me.
[196:04.11]I've never done that before.
[196:05.81]I don't, like, want anime intros on the radio.
[196:08.41]Like, I mean, if that were on there, that'd be cool, fine, but I don't, like, care.
[196:11.74]All e-flour.
[196:15.02]How do you say it?
[196:22.84]Good music.
[196:23.86]Good people.
[196:24.64]I lived good.
[196:26.02]Goodbye.
[196:31.02]What is that?
[196:33.18]What's this?
[196:33.99]Is it a wanted poster?
[196:34.95]Oh, it's a robot.
[196:40.83]Get him.
[196:42.41]There's no escape.
[196:43.65]I always wondered if I was truly conscious.
[196:45.93]I might finally get some answers.
[196:52.98]You wanna fight, huh?
[196:54.18]You act tough, but I've never seen you throw any punches.
[196:57.32]This time, I'll teach you a lesson.
[197:00.78]Yeah, turns out, turns out you didn't have a soul.
[197:08.58]No soul in the robot.
[197:10.15]I know, that's sad.
[197:26.56]Oh, this seems so easy by comparison to everything else.
[197:28.68]This song was awesome.
[198:25.23]Let's go, phase two!
[198:36.79]Shit.
[198:39.89]Shit!
[198:45.99]Fuck you!
[198:50.67]Ayyy! Expert.
[198:54.95]I can do it. I can do it. I can do it.
[198:55.93]It's easy.
[198:56.37]I can do it.
[199:33.80]Come on Gwen.
[199:35.44]Come on Gwen.
[200:14.83]You idiot!
[200:52.79]Can I touch it?
[200:53.31]I can.
[200:58.25]Oh!
[201:08.22]How are you so fast?
[201:13.70]Last time you got lucky.
[201:18.63]This time, oh, you won't be so lucky.
[201:44.67]Oh shit!
[201:55.37]I almost lost.
[201:55.93]I don't feel so good.
[202:10.92]Expert makes them have more health and you don't have as much time.
[202:14.28]I mean, we'll do it for a little while.
[202:17.32]Getting kind of creepy.
[202:29.12]Someone did the math on this game and the people living in it.
[202:32.83]They've been living for 12 million years.
[202:36.69]God.
[202:36.99]Oh, what about this guy?
[202:51.29]Worked too much.
[202:52.29]Should have done other things.
[202:53.29]Oh, damn.
[203:06.10]I've had a great time.
[203:06.74]I've had a great time.
[203:07.38]I had a great time.
[203:08.08]I had a great time.
[203:08.90]Does the ATM have a soul?
[203:13.27]That would be kind of funny.
[203:17.01]Do not harm the automatic terror machine or it will harm you.
[203:22.80]Oh shit, it does.
[203:42.81]I thought I could be sneaky.
[203:46.33]Oh wait, I can't grab those.
[204:26.07]Come on quick!
[204:35.00]Shoot it!
[204:38.60]Do not damage evil property.
[204:54.93]I over.
[205:01.36]It did have a soul.
[205:05.46]I guess it did.
[205:16.33]Rabbit.
[205:22.06]Where'd it go?
[205:25.66]Where'd it go?
[205:29.82]No!
[205:44.25]What's going on?
[205:46.42]What the fuck?
[205:50.46]Huh?
[205:51.90]What is it?
[205:59.54]I can't catch these.
[206:00.26]What's this?
[206:00.58]Speaking a different language?
[206:01.62]Yikes!
[206:30.60]Yikes!
[206:31.40]That's fucking crazy.
[206:33.92]Alright, alright.
[206:34.68]Retry, right?
[206:36.86]I think I can do it.
[206:41.29]I can do it.
[206:44.93]It's backwards.
[206:50.66]The text is backwards.
[206:51.60]Last checkpoint?
[206:51.94]Last checkpoint?
[207:00.28]Try it again.
[207:01.69]This one was wacky.
[207:08.56]I gotta focus real hard here.
[207:33.80]Holy shit in my fucking diaper.
[207:36.15]I was told to not say diaper ever again, and I just did.
[207:39.85]By more than one person.
[207:40.95]I know, I gotta roll over those.
[208:16.59]Oh, fuck you, I had it.
[208:18.18]Wowee, it's impossible.
[208:19.46]No, it's not.
[209:07.20]Damn it, it's so hard.
[209:09.62]I want to beat around the experts so bad.
[209:15.18]Same exact spot as last time.
[209:16.76]Shit.
[209:19.32]Difficulty.
[209:19.86]I know, I know.
[209:21.26]You need to jump and press a direction.
[209:22.55]Yeah, I know.
[209:23.99]I know, I know, I know.
[209:25.97]I know.
[209:26.23]It's just there's a lot going on on the screen.
[209:29.05]There's all this like candy shit all over the screen.
[210:10.87]Come on!
[210:13.13]What's it doing?
[210:13.57]Oy vey.
[210:22.15]Where are we going?
[210:24.78]Don't die.
[210:26.40]Don't go backwards on me here, please.
[210:31.16]It's so hard to tell where the fucking thing is.
[210:44.76]Was I supposed to touch that?
[210:45.72]I jumped over it.
[210:46.50]Shit.
[211:38.46]What are you doing?
[211:42.34]Oh no.
[211:58.05]Shit.
[212:00.39]You have what it takes?
[212:01.49]Uh, human?
[212:01.97]I don't know.
[212:11.27]Do I?
[212:15.54]Oh.
[212:22.22]Damn.
[212:22.74]Damn, that was close.
[212:35.28]Not required?
[212:37.02]You alright?
[212:37.52]You seem distressed.
[212:38.48]Hey, buddy.
[212:39.38]Do you want to save?
[212:40.02]Yeah.
[212:40.93]Down here.
[212:45.45]I ran out of time.
[212:46.13]20, like 15% health?
[212:54.65]No?
[212:55.01]No what?
[212:55.35]You idiot.
[212:55.65]What happened?
[212:57.19]That was your backup.
[213:00.54]My brother's two- three hundred- I- Alright, start timing out the people.
[213:04.56]Writing about how fat their family members are, okay?
[213:06.98]I don't care.
[213:08.72]What did I just do?
[213:09.42]I saved over the backup?
[213:18.11]We have been, okay, alright, alright, alright.
[213:21.09]What happened?
[213:21.71]Did I blow it?
[213:24.11]You saved over the one before you went into kill mode, oh.
[213:38.56]It's alright.
[213:39.14]It's okay.
[213:39.96]It's alright.
[213:42.14]That was wild.
[213:43.60]I thought I had it.
[213:45.88]I guess once the kind of neon colored ones, ones I can collect, once those started to come down, I didn't know I was supposed to kill... Oh, I have to kill you.
[214:01.49]I'm glad I still remember you.
[214:03.71]Could I please tell you something?
[214:05.10]Sure.
[214:05.26]Sure.
[214:06.82]You haven't said a word during the time we've known each other.
[214:08.80]You helped me even when I had done something bad to you.
[214:12.14]Without you, I never would have made it to the Gold Pig's Temple.
[214:16.73]You helped Flan in that game.
[214:18.81]Even though they attacked you later, you helped Green Mage get their eye back.
[214:22.89]Maybe it was all just to get your arm back.
[214:24.67]I don't know.
[214:26.67]Feels like there's something bigger going on here.
[214:28.44]Maybe, like, an important cause?
[214:31.16]That's why I have something to tell you.
[214:35.12]Green Mage blocked the door to Midnight Town.
[214:38.52]There's a hidden entrance.
[214:40.54]Green Mage told me to keep it hidden.
[214:43.36]I think Green Mage gave me this job because I would forget where it was.
[214:46.43]It would remain hidden for everyone.
[214:51.91]I trust what you are doing, Red.
[214:53.07]I think I'm ready now.
[214:57.77]Goodbye, old friend.
[215:06.92]May we see each other again.
[215:09.59]In the second eternity where we cannot die.
[215:12.75]Immortality in heaven.
[215:15.39]Where the whole thing starts over again.
[215:28.33]I won't allow you to go any further.
[215:32.42]Last time you had your arm, so many perished.
[215:35.07]If anyone else dies, I just cannot stand by and watch it happen again.
[215:43.43]I'm going to sneeze during this, and I can't mute because I'm playing.
[215:49.46]Yes!
[215:50.34]I'm ready.
[216:10.45]Oh, come on, bullshit.
[216:11.53]Give me a break.
[216:21.34]I tapped it!
[217:13.75]What the fuck are you talking about, bro?
[217:15.63]I was hitting X on the right spot!
[217:17.81]This is making me really mad.
[218:25.79]I don't know.
[218:27.40]I don't know.
[219:33.64]Get the fuck out of here!
[219:40.28]God, that was hard.
[219:41.50]That was crazy.
[219:50.65]That took severe concentration.
[220:00.00]It wasn't enough.
[220:05.50]I can't believe Holly beat that for you.
[220:07.96]Shh, don't say that.
[220:09.48]No, I'm gaming right now.
[220:11.06]Alright, you can go.
[220:13.82]You can go in the other room.
[220:15.80]Thank you so much.
[220:16.42]Yeah, thank you.
[220:20.70]Yep, I'll see you.
[220:23.60]Alright, who's left in here?
[220:32.18]Good job, Holly.
[220:33.90]Come on.
[220:37.82]Hey, what are you doing?
[220:44.11]You do have a pacifist save.
[220:45.65]It's the second file.
[220:51.19]Oh, that's right.
[220:51.75]It's a little bit before the end of the game though, right?
[221:03.42]What about this guy?
[221:06.90]You're asking for trouble?
[221:08.36]No troublemaking in my shop.
[221:11.36]Actually get to go against the shopkeeper.
[221:18.79]Good luck on this one.
[221:19.97]Oh, man.
[221:20.49]Alright.
[221:20.83]Is this when we turn it down to hard?
[221:21.99]We'll find out.
[221:23.33]Oh, you can't grab those.
[221:37.98]Can't grab those either.
[221:38.77]Alright, I get it.
[221:45.63]I was trying to grab all those in the beginning.
[221:47.43]You can only grab the orange ones.
[222:04.30]Come on.
[222:23.60]This is crazy.
[222:26.26]Okay.
[222:27.35]Okay.
[222:29.07]I'll give it a few more tries.
[222:31.93]You gotta just sneak in there and sneak out real quick.
[223:15.56]Come on, what?
[224:32.40]Oh my goodness!
[224:40.95]Alright, okay, alright, alright, alright.
[224:43.73]Alright, we're going back to hard.
[224:45.31]That's insane.
[224:46.97]Let's go.
[224:52.94]That's wild, especially when you left is right, right is left.
[224:56.62]I don't know about that one.
[225:03.98]Oh, did I training wheels myself though?
[225:06.54]We'll see.
[225:15.09]No, it's still pretty bad.
[225:53.82]Alright, now we reset.
[226:08.79]Reset!
[226:11.37]Oh my god, you idiot!
[226:57.96]Give me something to throw at him!
[227:45.87]Gonna be close!
[227:54.72]That was probably the best song of the whole game.
[227:59.64]That was awesome.
[228:04.54]Such a shame.
[228:14.97]Getting down to the final, like, 10.
[228:23.35]Getting a little weird.
[228:24.87]Oh, the chest.
[228:25.71]Can I still open this?
[228:26.43]I don't want to kill the chest.
[228:29.07]I want to open it.
[228:31.21]Didn't say the brown mage had it.
[228:43.97]This is getting pukey.
[228:48.82]Alright, here's the brown mage.
[228:52.84]What do you want?
[228:53.94]Kill.
[228:55.04]Who's making that ruckus?
[228:56.78]Scram and get out of here.
[228:57.66]What?
[229:08.88]Bring me batteries.
[229:11.11]Oh.
[229:13.57]Here.
[229:20.24]Ah, yes.
[229:20.80]Finally, I can power my toilet.
[229:22.14]Oh, right, I promised you.
[229:23.82]Here's a lava lamp.
[229:26.46]Oh, no.
[229:28.10]Seem to have lost it.
[229:30.38]Bring me a trampoline, then I can give you something.
[229:32.62]That's super promise.
[229:33.58]Alright, fuck this guy.
[229:40.59]Uh, forgive me for my thoughtless requests.
[229:42.83]I shall reward you greatly for your endeavors.
[229:45.45]I will need you to open the secret entrance to my keep.
[229:54.50]Please be very discreet.
[230:00.70]The secret entrance is located south of the pool of water.
[230:03.21]You'll find a pile of rocks and a door.
[230:06.09]I've unlocked it for you.
[230:11.19]Okay, so... I have to go down there?
[230:18.66]Alright.
[230:29.48]Wait, what about down here?
[230:33.50]Open it with my arm.
[230:34.66]Yes.
[230:34.88]You want to go in?
[230:39.26]Yes.
[230:56.35]What's all these tally marks?
[231:00.76]Oh, it's you!
[231:01.48]Hey there, I'm a bit surprised that you broke into my cellar.
[231:10.17]I guess I shouldn't be.
[231:11.39]Now, what is it that you want?
[231:20.74]Go down first?
[231:24.24]Don't kill, go down first.
[231:25.48]Should I go down first?
[231:31.35]Am I gonna softlock myself out of something?
[231:36.17]Yes.
[231:37.03]Yeah, go down first.
[231:37.93]Okay.
[231:44.73]This way, that way, this way, that way.
[231:50.08]Okay, so go down from here.
[231:51.24]Okay.
[231:57.92]Okay.
[232:01.66]What the hell is this?
[232:04.23]Sign says turn on colorblind mode in settings.
[232:07.13]I think I prefer it on, especially in battles.
[232:09.09]Really?
[232:12.75]I have to turn it on?
[232:25.23]You don't have to.
[232:26.43]Oh.
[232:28.05]I thought it was required for this exact mission or something.
[232:36.50]Wait.
[232:37.94]This is him.
[232:38.38]Green mage.
[233:06.65]Welcome, friend.
[233:07.43]I sadly have some bad news.
[233:09.31]I seem to have miscalculated my hypothesis.
[233:12.07]I need a very rare type of stick.
[233:14.45]Unless you have a special type of stick.
[233:16.62]Wait, you do?
[233:17.88]Give it to me and I'll finish it.
[233:22.40]Here.
[233:24.46]Finally, I give you this, as you have given me so much.
[233:27.58]The golden key.
[233:29.56]This key will unlock secrets.
[233:32.20]Cool.
[233:33.78]I got a golden key.
[233:36.56]Okay.
[233:36.74]Is this person alive?
[233:43.76]Oh.
[233:53.33]A well maintained porcelain toilet.
[233:55.12]Looks expensive.
[233:59.01]Why are you acting so hostile?
[234:01.17]What do you want?
[234:02.03]Wait.
[234:02.53]Oh, no.
[234:03.19]I've been tricked.
[234:04.65]It's you.
[234:06.81]Even after everything I've done for you.
[234:11.45]We don't fight him.
[234:12.03]He just... Oh, shit.
[234:16.35]He didn't get a... You don't get a cool song, apparently.
[234:21.13]Oh, shit.
[234:21.63]Okay.
[234:30.34]Alright, let's go to the chest.
[234:31.32]And then I want to open that other door too with the gold lock.
[234:48.78]Save the game first.
[234:51.62]Save, save, save, save, save, save.
[234:52.76]Alright, alright, alright.
[235:05.96]Alright, chest.
[235:06.66]What do you want to do?
[235:15.17]Interact.
[235:17.15]You want to use the key?
[235:18.27]Yes.
[235:19.99]Something powerful seems to resonate with the golden key.
[235:23.61]Are you sure?
[235:24.25]Yes.
[235:36.31]Alright.
[235:40.14]Who is it?
[235:43.29]Dr. Manhattan?
[235:44.83]Who's in here?
[236:26.85]Holy shit, that gets a little, okay, okay, that got a little crazy.
[236:39.42]Why is my pee green?
[236:40.75]I don't know, go to a doctor.
[236:42.13]That's a question for a doctor, not me.
[237:32.42]What?
[238:26.61]Ayyyyy! Awwwwww why.
[238:33.17]I can grab those?
[238:34.30]I thought I couldn't.
[238:34.90]I thought I couldn't grab those.
[238:36.10]I thought I couldn't grab those.
[238:36.82]I thought I couldn't.
[238:37.48]I can't.
[238:37.72]I can grab those?
[238:38.94]I thought I couldn't.
[238:41.54]Oh, I didn't know I could grab those.
[238:42.50]I thought I had to jump over them.
[239:14.54]I can grab them.
[239:15.62]Shit.
[239:16.90]I'm an idiot.
[239:25.52]Oh, man.
[239:26.12]Alright, Gamer Fatigue is sitting in.
[239:27.88]Gamer Fatigue is sitting in, I think.
[239:30.54]Let me drink some water.
[239:38.12]Gamer Fatigue is sitting in.
[239:40.74]I'm ready.
[239:46.70]This is one of the hardest battles in the game.
[239:48.37]I'll get it.
[239:49.85]Might take me a few more.
[239:51.74]I gotta get through the gamer fatigue and I'll be fine.
[240:31.41]AHH!
[241:12.68]so
[241:52.11]God damn it!
[241:53.01]Motherfucker, that lasts so long!
[241:54.85]His brain's overheating.
[242:05.06]Oh, it is.
[242:06.32]Oh, I was close.
[242:07.16]30%.
[242:07.36]You have a shower with your socks on?
[242:12.78]No.
[242:14.01]I don't.
[242:16.85]Alright, alright.
[242:18.09]It's all about, you gotta move to the edges of the screen.
[242:20.87]You can't panic.
[242:44.11]My nose is burning.
[242:45.05]Okay.
[243:10.07]Oh my god!
[243:11.47]Alright, I'm... I'm out, I'm out, no, I'm out.
[243:15.17]I can't leave.
[243:15.91]I'm stuck here forever.
[243:19.35]I think I'm stuck here forever.
[243:32.10]We'll forgive you if you lower the difficulty.
[243:33.72]I think I can do it.
[243:37.94]I think my brain's starting to get a little fried from the game though, to be honest.
[243:50.60]I think we're frying out.
[244:09.16]so
[244:48.90]Fuck you!
[245:35.03]Same exact spot as last time.
[245:37.11]Same spot as last time.
[245:40.38]I'm so close, though.
[245:41.80]I can feel it.
[245:44.46]I got him to 25% health.
[245:47.18]I just got to get through that section, and I got this shit.
[245:51.36]That section is the worst part.
[245:53.33]If he goes back to the first verse again, oh, it's over.
[245:56.55]I'll get him.
[245:58.43]I'll get him.
[245:59.31]Take a break.
[246:00.33]Take a break.
[246:00.65]Alright.
[246:01.49]We'll take a break for a sec.
[246:07.99]Okay.
[246:14.68]Deep breathing.
[246:15.20]Let's go.
[246:20.10]Alright.
[246:23.44]So when he does the second part of that chorus,
[246:27.63]If everything comes down, there's two blips where you're safe.
[246:34.15]And you have to collect them both and fire it back.
[246:38.01]Everything else is full.
[246:42.31]Shower with some socks on and eat cauliflower and mustard?
[246:45.21]You can just dodge it and do the fight later.
[246:48.37]Yeah, but I want to kill this motherfucker.
[246:52.27]Okay.
[246:53.43]I'm ready.
[246:54.65]One more attempt and I'm going to go pee.
[247:44.33]I don't know what I'm doing.
[248:23.53]So,
[249:05.56]Shut up, shut up, shut up, shut up.
[249:06.72]Quiet.
[249:07.12]Everybody quiet.
[249:08.44]Quiet.
[249:08.86]It happened in the same spot.
[249:13.62]Okay.
[249:15.40]It happened in the exact same spot again.
[249:17.04]Okay.
[249:22.46]Okay.
[249:24.72]We're not upset about anything.
[249:25.76]We're just exclaiming the fact that I need to move to the left side.
[249:32.25]I'll move to the left side instead of the right side.
[249:35.85]It's mirroring the pattern.
[249:36.99]I know.
[249:37.69]I know.
[249:38.05]Tasmanian Devil.
[249:44.32]Hold on.
[249:45.06]Did that actually sound like the Tasmanian Devil?
[249:48.50]Oh, my God.
[249:49.32]Let me see.
[249:49.84]Let me hear it.
[249:53.80]It's okay to be upset, I know.
[249:56.10]Oh, man, it's the same spot.
[250:03.14]Oh, shit.
[250:04.88]It keeps happening in the same location.
[250:06.78]I gotta move to the left side.
[250:16.29]You gonna piss yourself?
[250:17.49]Oh, I'm good, I'm good.
[250:33.20]You can hear okay, you won't know what happened
[250:38.12]So, right here, I can pinpoint you the exact place where my brain decided to try to switch this from anger to like, haha, this is a funny voice, right?
[250:49.53]Right there.
[250:50.31]Because then I go, like, I've tried, look, this is a funny voice now.
[250:59.33]Like, that was me, that was my brain desperately trying to make you guys think that that was like, oh, a funny voice I was doing.
[251:07.03]I realized that I was screaming, and I had to, like, in the middle of the scream, turn it into, like, a little funny, oh, haha, what a joke he's making.
[251:17.82]Larry David.
[251:19.46]I'm not fucking going anywhere, this is the one right here.
[251:25.42]Halfway through that, I was, I was like, oh, I'm a comedian!
[251:32.49]Shut up and get it right.
[251:34.70]This is it.
[251:35.82]This is the one.
[251:36.34]This is actually the one right now.
[251:37.59]I'm not fucking... I'm not gonna get hit once.
[252:40.02]This is so itchy.
[252:42.83]My face is so itchy.
[252:43.91]It's ruining everything.
[252:48.53]Oh, god damn it.
[252:49.37]Why does itch... Whatever.
[252:51.18]I'm fucked.
[254:01.91]Yeah, I didn't beat him.
[254:04.56]Oh, man.
[254:05.54]I'm finally free from the shackles.
[254:15.86]I hope to see you soon.
[254:16.96]Goodbye to this wretched world.
[254:18.84]No.
[254:20.14]No.
[254:21.08]No.
[254:33.77]I failed the DPS check.
[254:35.99]Reload the save?
[254:43.06]Um... You can find them again.
[254:45.34]Oh, I can fight them again.
[254:47.42]Okay.
[254:50.92]Oh, shit.
[254:51.72]That was crazy.
[254:52.62]What do I want to do?
[254:53.26]What is it?
[254:54.80]Gems of power and soulbound gems, sometimes known as the fruits of the gods.
[255:04.99]Okay.
[255:06.63]There are different gems in this world.
[255:07.95]Many are already known, but it's likely there are still just as many waiting to be discovered.
[255:12.28]To truly harness the gem's full potential, the user needs to fuse the gem with their body and soul.
[255:16.44]These are known as soul-binding gems.
[255:17.74]Okay.
[255:20.96]Okay.
[255:25.81]One should be cautious of soul-binding gems as they have a tendency to change the very nature of the ego once they are truly connected.
[255:32.59]In essence, it's very unnatural.
[255:37.78]Melding process is known to be quite painful for a gem to become a soulbound gem.
[255:41.36]It needs to replace at least one of the five senses.
[255:48.69]I hate that.
[255:49.97]I keep thinking about how much I hated how I said that.
[255:53.35]One or more need to be sacrificed so the gem can be truly activated.
[255:56.45]Okay.
[256:17.32]Especially considering it was like it happened in a chase bar.
[256:23.14]I hate it.
[256:24.44]I hate that sound.
[256:34.56]Oh, right.
[256:35.44]Hey, you think you're tough coming in here and making a ruckus?
[256:37.88]I'll show you ruckus.
[256:43.34]Alright.
[256:44.00]We'll take a break after this.
[256:45.05]We'll go pee and I'll come back.
[256:50.42]Crash can time.
[256:55.63]Stop farming 2022 awards.
[256:57.73]I'm not.
[256:58.59]I promise.
[256:59.19]Alright.
[257:01.23]Relax, dude.
[257:01.99]Come on.
[257:04.65]Not you.
[257:05.16]Me.
[257:36.12]This is night and day compared to the last one.
[257:48.31]Good block.
[257:50.63]Holy shit, what are you doing, man?
[257:52.43]Thomas just completely jinxed it, yeah?
[258:04.47]Ooh, not even my shell could protect me from you.
[258:07.31]We've had a long time for this.
[258:11.27]Thirteen.
[258:13.59]Alright, I'll go pee.
[258:20.64]I will see you guys in two minutes.
[258:22.04]Gonna go pee, gonna grab a little bit more water.
[258:23.94]I'm gonna shake around a little bit.
[258:26.68]My brain in the right place to do the rest of the game, which I'm assuming that we probably are getting near the end here.
[258:33.60]I'll be right back.
[260:39.46]you
[262:07.76]Okay, guys.
[262:10.80]Somebody wants to say something.
[262:14.58]They're a little groggy.
[262:17.24]They've been sleeping for a while.
[262:19.85]They don't want to be on camera.
[262:22.87]Are you doing Cheeto?
[262:28.03]Okay.
[262:33.98]Okay.
[262:39.62]Yeah, you're a little groggy.
[262:40.46]You're tired.
[262:41.60]Do you want some coffee or something?
[262:42.44]You've been asleep for like two years.
[262:43.90]Do you want anything?
[262:51.28]Okay.
[262:52.64]That's a pretty big Burger King order.
[262:57.36]You want a... You want a shake?
[263:02.46]Okay.
[263:03.10]Chocolate?
[263:05.60]Okay.
[263:06.80]You want me to put you back on the shelf?
[263:10.70]Okay.
[263:15.68]Back on the shelf.
[263:16.40]He's not ready for the camera yet.
[263:17.88]He's a little tired.
[263:19.02]He was asleep for a couple of years.
[263:20.40]He doesn't want to be on camera.
[263:23.67]A large Burger King order.
[263:25.87]McDonald's, whatever he wants.
[263:32.35]He's just waking up.
[263:32.89]It takes like a few days to wake up.
[263:38.07]Alright, let's go.
[263:50.90]We're gonna do a Burger King Shito stream.
[263:53.90]Alright, who do we got left?
[263:57.54]I already did this stuff.
[264:07.44]What's Shito's order?
[264:10.31]Uh, so Shido really only eats very, very little.
[264:14.39]So, Shido likes nuggets.
[264:17.93]So what ends up happening is he eats one nugget.
[264:20.21]Like the half of one nugget takes him like 45 minutes or so.
[264:22.91]Um, he kind of nibbles at it, and then I just eat the rest.
[264:31.71]Blue Slime is working hard in the Cursed Castle.
[264:35.99]Can I open this?
[264:38.47]Ow!
[264:39.57]Thank you for moving the lock.
[264:41.59]Green mage locked me up to keep you away, I guess.
[264:45.99]Oh wait, wasn't green mage like down in the thing?
[264:47.49]Yeah, hold on.
[264:47.91]Let's go get green mage.
[264:49.37]He was down.
[264:50.51]Where was he?
[265:05.92]Alright, let's go get him.
[265:08.98]Hi, green mage.
[265:10.62]It's time to go.
[265:19.26]From this point forward, I need 12 more souls.
[265:22.72]What's the, um... How much time do I got left in the game?
[265:26.92]This is where it ends.
[265:31.73]After spending an eternity in Mushroom Forest...
[265:36.67]How anticlimactic?
[265:38.67]Maybe like an hour or two?
[265:39.53]Alright, cool.
[265:40.97]Absolute max of maybe two hours.
[265:42.49]Okay.
[265:57.90]Alright, green.
[265:58.84]Let's go!
[265:59.24]I can't... I don't know.
[266:03.04]I can catch these.
[266:07.89]Wait, stop.
[266:10.61]You're serious?
[266:13.71]Hear me out.
[266:17.72]Okay.
[266:22.66]If you want a true clash of life and death, you'll have to spice it up.
[266:27.83]Come into my playroom.
[266:36.43]I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
[266:38.02]That corridor is endless.
[266:39.76]Well, technically it isn't endless.
[266:41.10]There's an end.
[266:42.08]It'll just take forever to get there.
[266:43.36]I know, because I made the corridor.
[266:46.26]Alright.
[267:00.03]Hi, buddy.
[267:06.37]Main reason why I gave the ruby to you is to have them separated.
[267:10.15]Together they are too powerful in wrong hands.
[267:13.05]The emerald is locked inside an indestructible chest stored with an acquaintance of mine.
[267:17.22]For your own sake, I won't tell you where the aquamarine is located.
[267:22.32]Take good care of yourself, green.
[267:23.92]It takes four hours to go down the hallway and there's shit in the hallway so you can't just tape a button down.
[267:32.85]Are you kidding me?
[267:38.70]Welcome to my real playroom.
[267:40.32]Only a special few know of its existence.
[267:42.72]Let us not delay the inevitable.
[267:44.34]Or are you too scared you might lose?
[267:45.78]Alright, it's time for you to die, motherfucker.
[267:48.04]Let's go.
[267:52.58]Oh, he said, Forsen watched Shrek during the walk.
[267:56.11]Wait, wait, wait.
[267:56.95]Are you serious?
[267:59.67]Hold on.
[268:01.51]Really?
[268:01.85]That's fucking hilarious.
[268:11.69]That's amazing.
[268:19.23]I was there.
[268:20.01]I haven't felt this alive in a long time.
[268:23.75]Let's go.
[268:24.19]It'll be the greatest duel ever.
[268:32.64]I can't.
[268:38.98]Oh, that's
[269:14.51]I'm trying to grab those and it's too much.
[269:17.24]Alright, sit up.
[269:20.78]I'm too busy trying to grab those ones and I just avoid them.
[269:58.66]Alright.
[270:00.00]What am I doing wrong here?
[270:01.18]This is not that hard.
[270:03.73]You know, I'm just overthinking it now.
[270:06.51]The last, like, insane electricity man, like, kind of... I need to put, like, my brain back where it was.
[271:05.09]Oh!
[271:37.57]Can I catch those?
[271:47.05]What the fuck?!
[271:58.66]Oh my god, you're killing me here.
[272:19.49]I can't grab anything.
[272:20.35]Oh, shit.
[272:33.97]No, I'm good.
[272:35.19]I'm good.
[272:35.39]I'm good.
[272:57.13]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[273:03.98]Oh my god, you gotta be kidding me.
[273:05.42]Pity loop?
[273:06.14]That's fine.
[273:11.03]I got pity looped.
[273:19.95]It's alright, I'll take it.
[273:20.65]It will do.
[273:31.08]A 2?
[273:35.55]Okay.
[273:35.77]9 to 11.
[273:44.85]What characters are even left?
[274:02.74]What's that?
[274:08.01]I'm not doing the hallway.
[274:17.63]I'm not doing that.
[274:18.42]No.
[274:27.04]That song was awesome.
[274:31.19]That was a really good one.
[274:39.21]Okay, blue slime in the castle.
[274:45.52]It's only four hours?
[274:46.50]That's four hours too long.
[274:51.86]I think everybody's dead here.
[274:54.54]Okay.
[274:55.84]Okay.
[275:07.26]So, this way.
[275:10.54]It's locked.
[275:10.94]Favorite type of cheese?
[275:12.90]Probably Swiss or some kind of cheddar, probably.
[275:19.85]Where should I go?
[275:22.59]These people are in here, right?
[275:24.39]The ghost people?
[275:29.71]What do you want?
[275:30.16]I bet what you heard from the forest spirit was not what you wanted to hear.
[275:37.26]What are you doing?
[275:38.73]Oh, again?
[275:39.47]Oh.
[275:39.53]What?
[275:50.13]The blue slime is working hard in the cursed castle.
[276:01.08]My work is not done.
[276:01.90]Until I've had my revenge.
[276:14.86]You must kill everyone from this immortal world before we allow you to continue.
[276:18.24]You have 11 souls to liberate.
[276:19.94]You cannot kill what is already dead.
[276:26.63]You must kill everyone before we can close this realm.
[276:32.82]It can give you something that will help you.
[276:35.01]Help you find the souls.
[276:36.11]Some might say the extra help isn't necessary, but I say take all the help you can get.
[276:39.41]Do you want it?
[276:40.47]Yeah.
[276:42.25]This lantern, it will help you find souls.
[276:47.84]I want to go away, but I can't seem to let go.
[276:55.78]What do you want?
[276:57.76]Wait, what?
[276:59.21]The beast within the cursed castle protects a spirit.
[277:03.33]of a lantern.
[277:06.71]If you stand still, a guide will show you where the souls are.
[277:09.05]Oh, this is what they were talking about.
[277:09.95]That person said that.
[277:11.98]Ah, alright.
[277:12.96]Cool.
[277:15.94]No help.
[277:16.62]No help.
[277:19.16]No help.
[277:36.46]Where you at?
[277:38.32]Huh?
[277:43.73]What?
[277:43.87]How does that make any sense?
[277:54.31]Why are you telling me to do that?
[277:55.34]Nice GPS.
[278:08.14]Come here.
[278:08.54]Why does it run away every time?
[278:19.31]Annoying.
[278:19.63]Alright, yeah, there's the knight guy.
[278:22.55]There's people in the castle, too.
[278:26.23]At our differences, both of us had our own goals.
[278:28.59]Me trying to stop you, you walking all over me and not showing any sympathy.
[278:32.49]Hurt my feelings.
[278:33.48]It hurt my finances.
[278:34.96]Right now, my friend, I understand that you're on some kind of killing spree.
[278:39.70]We can't just let that slide, you know?
[278:41.04]Alright, dude, let's go.
[278:59.12]Match the colors.
[279:30.21]Please, can you stop?
[279:37.32]Why bother?
[280:04.32]This guy looks like Jerma when he's streaming.
[280:06.58]That's true.
[280:09.00]You sure are a tough guy, you little red twerp.
[280:11.96]Alright, there are ten souls remaining.
[280:23.47]We're gonna find them all.
[280:33.44]He's as naked as ever.
[280:34.60]Oh, we have to ride this back.
[280:52.31]What the fuck?
[280:53.61]There's somebody here.
[280:54.33]I didn't know that was... Okay.
[281:07.72]There's somebody actually on the train.
[281:08.89]I can't really read what they're saying.
[281:38.53]This is gonna hurt.
[281:46.97]This is gonna hurt, yeah.
[281:56.31]Nine.
[281:57.75]I guess my days end here.
[282:04.56]Nobody else to move the car?
[282:17.19]It's the only character with a damage animation?
[282:18.95]Really?
[282:21.59]There's no music now, this is weird.
[282:32.38]Who's next?
[282:48.84]Had a nap midstream, why is he killing everyone?
[282:52.75]You're gonna have to go back and see what happened.
[282:57.29]Oh no, not these people.
[282:59.63]You ain't going nowhere.
[283:02.85]Against both at the same time.
[283:06.07]Let's get him, Zob!
[283:08.30]They both have such painful sound effects for noises.
[283:15.90]He's gonna be screaming the whole time, it's gonna be so annoying.
[283:26.80]Oh, they have different health bars!
[283:38.90]Oh god, that's too many sounds!
[283:55.09]Oh, the beat!
[283:55.73]I can't focus.
[283:56.53]One of them's almost dead.
[284:26.97]That's too powerful.
[284:28.02]Now what?
[285:02.55]And I... Impossible.
[285:07.93]Somebody said, I don't get this combat system at all, but it looks fun.
[285:11.03]So, the first half of the game, you do not have a combat.
[285:14.65]You don't have a laser beam that I'm shooting out.
[285:19.02]You essentially... Well, I'll let you figure it out.
[285:20.92]It's a fun game.
[285:21.52]It's good.
[285:23.72]Found a loophole in our contract.
[285:25.18]Kevin McCloud.
[285:29.72]Kevin McCloud.
[285:32.82]A two?
[285:34.36]Yeah.
[285:35.32]Down to seven.
[285:46.40]Oh no, I don't want to kill these guys.
[285:48.04]I like these guys.
[285:48.68]Hey there, pal.
[285:58.43]Oh, you seem to have found your arm.
[286:00.45]Great news.
[286:02.42]I like these guys.
[286:03.10]Hey, buddy.
[286:11.15]Great to see you again.
[286:11.93]Oh.
[286:16.83]You can't come here and cause a ruckus.
[286:19.76]I don't like the vibes you're putting out, man.
[286:21.52]Somebody should teach you a thing or two about bad behavior.
[286:25.56]You think that qualifies us to help, Buck?
[286:28.16]You're darn right, Flan.
[286:29.54]We won't go easy on you, kid.
[286:36.93]I really like these, I don't want to kill these guys.
[286:45.99]That was cool, he's cool.
[287:23.10]Oh, shit.
[287:23.70]Fun.
[287:26.36]Uh-oh.
[287:29.35]Oh, he's pissed.
[287:38.27]What happened?
[287:39.83]What the fuck?
[287:43.53]I should've killed the turtle.
[287:44.69]I should've killed the turtle first.
[287:46.14]Oh.
[288:05.47]It's Ornstein and Smough.
[288:09.26]Oy.
[288:52.02]That it?
[288:52.58]Phase 3?
[288:54.77]I got pity looped again?
[288:55.63]No, I didn't.
[288:58.37]You horrible creature.
[289:00.29]I hate you.
[289:00.95]9 to 5, right?
[289:11.94]Okay.
[289:15.16]Everyone, they certified me?
[289:16.24]I feel bad.
[289:34.89]Okay.
[289:48.94]What are you in here?
[289:52.30]They are in here.
[289:57.73]Oh, this shit.
[289:58.65]I remember this.
[289:59.33]I gotta go down.
[290:03.87]What?
[290:06.71]Just kidding.
[290:07.27]Up.
[290:18.20]I remember it.
[290:18.68]Do you want to stop killing?
[290:26.05]I don't know.
[290:27.69]I feel like I'm doing the mission.
[290:28.77]I'm on the mission.
[290:29.41]No.
[290:31.35]Master Hand?
[290:55.48]Alright.
[290:57.30]This game's crazy.
[291:10.95]Ooh, I like it.
[291:17.22]Okay, let's go.
[291:30.27]Okay, that's a good one.
[292:21.67]Damn.
[292:23.75]Woo!
[292:31.38]Oh, my colors are blending.
[292:32.62]The colors are blending together in my brain.
[292:50.89]Shit, I don't think I beat him.
[293:03.88]Jesus.
[293:11.96]I barely got the loop, come on.
[293:18.17]I want to see the heart rate.
[293:19.07]You should have seen the heart rate on the magical lightning guy.
[293:27.00]Boy, the hand didn't have a soul though.
[293:29.32]Oh my god, what are you doing?
[293:39.33]It was probably really high.
[293:40.49]Alright.
[293:50.76]Have I locked doors?
[293:52.82]This is the beginning of the game.
[293:53.80]I am free again, thanks to you.
[293:58.14]The mage has locked me up.
[293:59.18]The purple mage is in the room with the mirror of truth.
[294:03.09]We trust in you to finish the deed.
[294:04.73]Who's in here?
[294:17.85]Wait, what?
[294:19.08]Oh, right.
[294:24.30]What is that?
[294:31.70]Going to the theater?
[294:39.86]You killed the cursor, that's your hand now.
[294:42.56]Oh, okay.
[294:45.66]Oh, the maze!
[294:46.58]The spider, that's right.
[294:47.58]Okay.
[294:48.14]Okay.
[294:53.48]Wait, why does it want me to go up here?
[294:56.98]Where was that spider?
[295:00.44]Hold on.
[295:01.02]Let me go to the theater.
[295:23.33]Somebody in the theater.
[295:24.15]Who's in the theater?
[295:38.53]It's a 50% chance every time you walk in.
[295:41.54]Oh, where is he?
[296:00.60]Either you were lying to me, or these are some really stupid, ridiculous odds.
[296:03.44]Alright, where's the spider though?
[296:15.42]I want to do spider first.
[296:26.85]There's still several people in the castle.
[296:29.72]Asshole knew the slime brothers.
[296:37.08]I'll just go back down.
[296:45.20]You're insanely stupid sometimes.
[296:49.70]How?
[296:50.06]Because I didn't know that it was... I don't have a Wikipedia open about how to trigger the event to happen.
[297:08.41]Oh, you!
[297:09.99]You're alive.
[297:10.67]If you find pink spirits, an old saying says not to trust them.
[297:16.93]Okay.
[297:18.38]I'm going to be quite mischievous.
[297:21.12]I guess this is as good as any place to die.
[297:22.82]It's cold and comfortable.
[297:25.90]What would you like to die?
[297:26.82]What does that sound?
[297:51.18]What if I can't... Do I play by myself?
[297:52.82]This sound is killing me.
[298:10.70]What is this?
[298:11.08]I don't...
[298:29.66]Okay.
[298:33.42]Congratulations.
[298:40.35]Who's the type of person to say please to his Alexa?
[298:45.91]Sure.
[298:48.49]Find the spider.
[298:54.44]I'm here.
[298:57.18]Where are you?
[299:00.46]Where are you?
[299:04.88]Let's go.
[299:14.19]Favorite album of all time?
[299:15.31]Probably Demon Days or Plastic Beach.
[299:17.51]I like them both equally.
[299:32.93]No, wait!
[299:34.29]Oh!
[299:36.05]Right.
[299:36.41]I have to avoid those.
[299:42.14]Right.
[299:45.10]That's gonna be a pain in the ass.
[299:50.34]Okay, avoid everything.
[299:55.58]Just avoid everything.
[300:38.82]You stupid idiot!
[300:41.92]I can't believe it.
[300:42.92]I can't believe it.
[300:47.31]I can't believe it.
[300:55.15]Hold on.
[300:56.71]Hold on.
[301:01.95]You couldn't press it before, now you can't avoid it.
[301:03.77]No, well, I... Alright, no, no, no.
[301:05.21]Start over, start over.
[301:06.01]Let's just do this right.
[301:47.56]Dude, I'm slowing down hard.
[301:49.76]I feel like I've been looking at a kaleidoscope for five straight hours.
[303:00.28]Oh, my God.
[303:01.52]Sensory.
[303:08.88]Oh, stop.
[303:10.86]I'm turning it down.
[303:11.48]Oh, my goodness, dude.
[303:13.56]Come on.
[303:21.25]That was unbearable.
[303:25.55]Now what?
[303:28.74]Okay.
[303:32.50]Is peace returning to the immortal realm?
[303:51.81]I should follow the pink?
[303:52.73]I was thinking about it.
[304:04.80]Okay.
[304:05.18]Up.
[304:05.35]Over here.
[304:09.53]Up.
[304:10.17]Up.
[304:11.69]Whoa.
[304:12.51]What is this?
[304:38.72]Two, two, two.
[304:45.03]Two, two, two.
[304:53.05]Uh, what do you want?
[304:56.76]Hello, Red.
[304:57.84]Keep following the candy canes and you will arrive at Bubblegum Land.
[305:01.90]You sure pack a punch.
[305:34.96]It's a long way.
[305:41.53]It's gonna be a pain in the ass to go back.
[305:42.79]Vampire guy said don't trust pink spirits.
[305:52.96]I'm not trusting them.
[305:53.80]I'm about to kill them.
[305:57.78]Come here!
[306:09.10]Oh, trust them.
[306:11.16]I'm here to murder them.
[306:12.92]How long is this?
[306:40.88]What the fuck?
[306:43.08]Am I gonna have to put on Shrek while I do this?
[307:03.23]Something's not right.
[307:04.61]I don't know what it is, but something's not right.
[307:07.64]Something's not right.
[307:21.04]What?
[307:39.60]Oh please, you just have to walk backwards.
[307:48.76]Welcome to Bubblegum Land.
[307:50.24]Relax and rest.
[307:55.29]I do a job badly, but you can do it well.
[307:57.55]Is there a save point anywhere?
[308:04.78]It appears good to be a Bubblegum entity.
[308:09.98]Welcome to Bubblegum Land.
[308:10.98]The quest is so big.
[308:21.85]Big bubblegum spirit.
[308:22.91]Some life is supposed to extend into centuries while others are shorter.
[308:25.49]If one is in a loop where they cannot die and yet they fear death,
[308:42.74]That is not a pleasant way to live.
[308:44.09]That's why you, as the human, have a gift.
[308:48.03]You get to experience the world within all its dualities, unfairness, and chaos.
[308:53.29]With an expiration date.
[308:55.81]That someday this will all end.
[308:57.31]It's truly the most bittersweet feature of your existence.
[309:02.44]I give you only my words of advice.
[309:05.70]You're doing this for a cause, a cause that is good.
[309:07.92]Do what you think is right.
[309:10.40]If you do not agree, then who is to stop a god of death?
[309:14.57]Much has been said, we must go on.
[309:16.85]Didn't have a soul?
[309:32.55]Alright, well, what's your deal?
[309:39.21]Oh, you found my backup secret hideout.
[309:41.81]Now that you found me, what are you going to do?
[309:43.96]Are you going to finish me off because I took your arm?
[309:47.02]Or are you going to stroll out where you came from?
[309:54.47]You are here to erase my existence.
[309:57.36]You've destroyed my empire.
[309:58.48]You've ruined my reputation.
[309:59.78]You've forced me to flee from my life.
[310:02.10]Your thirst to kill does not end.
[310:05.92]Only because I took your arm.
[310:08.70]You disgust me.
[310:09.92]It's my life you want.
[310:10.88]I won't give it away easily.
[310:12.00]I will make you walk through hell.
[310:20.08]Sure you will.
[310:24.93]Bubblegum hell.
[310:25.83]Alright, let's go.
[310:57.09]Dude, it's easy.
[310:58.33]Settle down.
[311:27.21]yeah really you're gonna let this shitty stuff hit you
[312:00.29]Why do we keep seeing that thing?
[312:01.17]Someone's vaping in your room, dude.
[312:09.89]You put on quite a show, you annoying wooden doll.
[312:13.15]You have bested me.
[312:14.15]I wish thousands and millions of years of torment upon you.
[312:19.84]Hey, dude, you hit my car yesterday, dickwad.
[312:21.56]Are you gonna pay?
[312:22.16]You drove off and I'm gonna go bankrupt with it.
[312:30.92]Ooh.
[312:34.76]You hit my car.
[312:43.21]There's two left.
[312:50.40]I'm assuming that's including me.
[312:53.94]Right?
[312:54.90]Kinda has to be.
[313:06.49]Purple mage and me in the last two people, right?
[313:10.52]Purple mage is waiting in the mirror of truth, praying.
[313:18.06]Okay.
[313:37.77]And the theater only responds when you go back to hub 50%.
[313:39.66]Does that guy count?
[313:51.86]He's optional, okay.
[313:54.56]Because I'll be honest with you, I don't know if my brain can handle fighting that guy again.
[314:02.34]I could try maybe once or twice.
[314:10.20]How do I get out of here?
[314:27.99]Let's peep the horror.
[314:28.85]I don't have the horror.
[314:32.82]Alright, let's go up to the mirror.
[314:34.86]See what he has to say.
[314:35.56]I'm gonna get a big reveal, I guarantee it, right?
[315:01.06]Want my GameCube controller back?
[315:02.37]I don't have your GameCube controller, man.
[315:09.99]Alright, this is it.
[315:13.08]One of the final people to grab here.
[315:16.47]For many years, I have been told that this mirror tells you the truth.
[315:23.59]I spent many nights thinking on this.
[315:27.48]If you have any decency left, I urge you to leave.
[315:30.76]Just stop this act and leave.
[315:35.86]You're not a killer.
[315:37.04]Refund this game if you can.
[315:39.13]Just leave us alone.
[315:43.14]We getting existential here?
[315:50.58]So you've come here to kill me.
[315:53.28]Maybe this was meant to be.
[315:54.54]Although, I won't give up my life easily.
[316:01.54]Well, they say that because they know you're already five to six hours into the game, you can't refund it.
[316:05.50]They don't put that shit an hour and 45 minutes into the game.
[316:10.80]They put it six hours into the game.
[316:39.38]Oh, stop hitting me.
[316:50.13]It's alright, start it over again, I don't care.
[316:58.60]Sloppy.
[317:03.71]He's healing.
[317:04.57]Okay, stop being so sloppy.
[317:06.40]He's healing.
[318:16.99]Alright.
[318:20.73]This is one more.
[318:21.35]This is how it ends.
[318:25.75]You fought well, I never stood a chance.
[318:27.95]Here's the final gem.
[318:32.63]Final gemstone.
[318:33.43]Okay.
[318:52.68]Go to the Court of the Lost Spirits.
[318:56.64]Oh, back to those guys.
[318:57.62]Alright.
[319:07.59]Okay.
[319:10.72]It's gonna be me.
[319:11.84]It's definitely gonna be me.
[319:24.86]Yeah, it's gonna be me.
[319:26.64]I'm gonna, like, punch myself in the face and I'm gonna end up dying.
[319:31.32]And I'm gonna wake up somewhere in, like, another world or something.
[319:35.47]Let me save it.
[319:37.91]Here we go.
[319:41.87]Alright, so it's saved.
[319:46.73]Fight the light guy first.
[319:48.71]I don't think I have it in me.
[319:53.05]Kill the lamp.
[319:58.41]Hmm.
[320:00.53]Did I?
[320:05.15]Just do the like eye on easy mode.
[320:07.20]That's not a bad idea.
[320:10.16]I'll try that.
[320:13.24]I'll turn it down.
[320:14.20]Just to see what happens when you win.
[320:15.96]Right?
[320:16.54]Let's put it on like normal or something.
[320:19.96]Yeah.
[320:30.06]You can do it on normal?
[320:30.94]Okay.
[320:35.23]That's lame.
[320:36.61]Well, I want to see what happens.
[320:47.69]Alright, 50% chance, right?
[320:48.41]There he is.
[320:49.55]Alright.
[320:54.32]This world is a shell.
[320:55.28]It gives me no pleasure to witness this twisted experiment.
[320:59.62]Alright, let's go for it.
[321:02.50]Let me just get the win here.
[321:03.30]We're not on expert.
[321:07.18]We're not on hard.
[321:08.21]I just want to see the end.
[321:08.99]I'll put it back.
[321:54.64]I can already read the chat messages that say lost on normal, so I can't lose.
[322:37.09]Alright, relax.
[323:11.64]Oh, fuck!
[323:15.90]I did it.
[323:20.63]That's heavy.
[323:24.95]Finally, a worthy warrior.
[323:26.49]Use it well!
[323:30.96]Emerald.
[323:33.94]Okay.
[323:38.56]That was pretty cool.
[323:44.08]What about the door in the forest?
[323:46.58]Is this my only opportunity to see that?
[323:56.65]No one's left here.
[323:57.29]Okay.
[323:58.51]Alright, let me save it here.
[323:59.27]I'm going to go look at it.
[324:00.13]That's true.
[324:16.02]you can do it after the game but that's like in a while okay uh where over here do the right thing
[324:44.33]You're probably gonna want to put this on normal again.
[324:46.43]Well, we'll find out.
[324:53.99]That door was here somewhere?
[324:55.31]This one's okay, alright.
[325:02.88]Where was that door?
[325:03.58]Over here?
[325:18.92]Where is it?
[325:19.24]You like cucumbers?
[325:26.32]Yeah.
[325:27.64]Yeah.
[325:29.22]He's doing end of the stream voice.
[325:30.38]I'm kind of tired, I'll be honest.
[325:35.23]My brain is, um... I feel like I've watched like six movies.
[325:51.13]I'm so close here.
[325:52.03]This is the final act of the game.
[325:54.07]I'm not going to stop now.
[325:59.23]Where is it?
[326:07.20]I feel like it was right here somewhere.
[326:11.28]There it is.
[326:12.50]Okay.
[326:16.50]What's in here?
[326:27.13]Oh, it's the thing.
[326:28.17]It's that professor's... junk pile thing?
[326:46.72]Hello, hello, save, down here.
[326:50.47]The ending takes a while, you should probably just do it.
[326:52.31]Oh, does it take a long time?
[327:05.27]A jump rope holds itself up.
[327:06.99]Do you accept the challenge?
[327:09.41]Sure.
[327:09.59]Alright, I'm going to give this one my all here.
[327:27.39]I've got enough time to do
[328:00.76]Thank you.
[329:00.77]Holy smokes.
[329:07.11]I guess you don't kill this thing.
[329:11.56]Okay.
[329:22.22]You want to unlock the door with your arm?
[329:24.38]Sure.
[329:35.72]Okay.
[329:46.67]What is that?
[329:47.43]Alright, I gotta just grab this.
[329:53.29]My head hurts.
[329:53.87]I got the aquamarine.
[329:56.03]Alright, get me out.
[329:57.45]Get me out of here.
[330:05.80]Hey, my grandma said you're cute.
[330:07.22]Alright, well, just put me on speaker.
[330:14.33]Put me on speaker.
[330:14.81]I'm going to assume that I'm on speaker.
[330:19.67]Put me on speaker now.
[330:23.01]Hello there, darling.
[330:24.17]I just wanted to say I can't believe you think that I learned that I'm a cute and attractive man.
[330:32.28]I don't know what you look like, I'm not entirely sure, but your grandson seems to know quite a few.
[330:38.67]He's got a good taste, you know, I'm old.
[330:41.63]I don't know how old you are in particular, but just want to say that your grandson's in good hands here.
[330:51.25]As he watches me, I have a lot of good people here, a lot of friends and stuff, and family and everything.
[330:59.29]Family's incredibly important, so I just want to let you know that your grandson's in a good place right now.
[331:07.81]You think I'm cute?
[331:08.59]Thank you.
[331:09.59]Okay, now take me off speakerphone.
[331:14.02]Dude passed the fucking joint.
[331:16.30]Did you buy it?
[331:21.17]Alright, let's see the end.
[331:40.68]Remember, why do you hate everything?
[331:44.53]What?
[331:45.35]I like frogs.
[332:07.54]it's alright I'm ready I'm going I'm finishing the game I got a little I still have a little bit of juice left I do
[332:19.24]You saying it's about an hour from here?
[332:21.03]I have a little bit of gas left.
[332:22.37]I think I'm good to go.
[332:31.05]You got all the gems.
[332:35.36]Go in and out of the blue door now.
[332:36.70]Do I actually have all the gems?
[332:45.78]Yes.
[332:47.97]I have aquamarine, emerald, and ruby.
[332:53.33]Where's the diamond?
[332:56.86]Where's sapphire?
[332:59.44]Where's quartz?
[333:00.00]You're very close.
[333:09.59]The blue door is the true ending.
[333:11.61]Oh.
[333:27.28]Gotta get out of here.
[333:37.37]No help.
[333:38.29]Why not?
[333:44.19]You've liberated everyone in the forest.
[333:45.55]The mushrooms are never truly alive anyways.
[333:47.31]Okay.
[333:51.09]Final gem is black tourmaline.
[333:52.65]Well, then it must be pretty good for my energy levels then.
[334:04.14]Alright, so I can open the blue door.
[334:06.00]I mean, this one here.
[334:07.35]There's nothing alive in this part of the realm.
[334:18.76]Do you still wish to enter?
[334:21.60]So be it.
[334:32.55]Oh, why is the game so quiet?
[334:36.99]Other blue door.
[334:38.87]Sorry about that.
[334:39.37]I turned it down for some reason.
[334:42.88]Different blue door?
[334:52.94]The other blue door.
[334:53.78]In and out of a blue door.
[334:54.78]And then... That one?
[335:02.88]I mean this one here.
[335:07.54]I would call that a gray door.
[335:10.76]With blue trim.
[335:21.68]Go in and out of it.
[335:26.37]Uh...
[335:30.03]The green door is better.
[335:30.91]I'm just going in here.
[335:40.20]I'm just going in there.
[335:41.42]I'm just going in.
[335:43.22]I mean, there could be some super secret weird thing.
[335:47.08]I'm just going for it.
[335:55.07]You have done a massive task.
[335:56.29]Everyone is dead except one.
[335:59.21]Some of the ones you've slain might not approve of your actions.
[336:03.05]Those who felt wrong, there will be reconciliation.
[336:12.15]It is time for you to come out.
[336:13.35]Who?
[336:27.88]Who?
[336:40.85]Hello, human.
[336:41.85]Or should I say, hello, red?
[336:45.39]You've done well.
[336:46.57]It is time to go back home now.
[336:48.59]Close all the doors.
[336:50.37]Permanently.
[336:56.72]Hardest part is coming up.
[337:01.38]Close all the doors.
[337:07.23]Doors locked.
[337:07.75]Okay, just get rid of all the doors.
[337:09.66]Thank you for staying persistent and helping us Finally some peace in the world.
[337:21.12]Why do the doors talk?
[337:28.45]We had some good times.
[337:29.67]Now it's time to say goodbye.
[337:35.89]Okay.
[337:36.89]Finally, piece of glass.
[337:38.49]Alright, goodbye.
[337:43.41]Will we meet again in another plane of existence?
[337:45.89]You've been awesome, buddy.
[337:55.52]Why are there some nonchalant about this?
[337:58.46]You're doing the right thing.
[338:10.54]Am I going to come out of a birth canal?
[338:14.80]Right?
[338:15.14]Am I about to like be born?
[338:15.96]Is this going to be like I'm born or something?
[338:18.62]It's supposed to be purgatory.
[338:19.82]I might wake up in a hospital bed.
[338:20.98]Next stop, the waiting room.
[338:31.85]Well done.
[338:32.57]This world has lived for a long time.
[338:34.79]You have done a tremendous task.
[338:36.33]You could have quit anytime you wanted, but you pushed through even when it got difficult.
[338:40.45]This is a great feat that only a few could accomplish.
[338:44.07]Use this determination wisely.
[338:46.10]Now only one remains.
[338:50.72]Me.
[338:51.70]I told you it was me.
[338:53.02]As long as the last star shines, we can't depart from this world.
[338:57.22]We shall grant you power to kill our son.
[339:05.44]The rabbit?
[339:05.90]The final battle has begun.
[339:15.63]We must hurry.
[339:17.21]The last star needs to die for us to continue.
[339:40.72]That's like Peter Griffin plays fucking Undertale.
[339:45.58]Oh God.
[339:46.24]Here we go.
[339:50.64]Negative 100 degrees Celsius.
[340:07.01]What?
[340:07.21]I can't catch that?
[340:07.89]What the fuck are you talking about?
[340:09.13]Excuse me?
[340:11.69]I'm grabbing them.
[340:13.53]Do I have this timed wrong because it's stretched out?
[340:15.31]Because the perception's all warped.
[340:21.72]That's true.
[341:16.22]It's getting closer
[341:50.19]It's getting closer!
[341:54.23]Fuck you.
[342:17.17]Oh come on!
[342:30.98]Uh-oh.
[342:34.31]Can I dodge?
[342:43.09]Damn.
[342:43.37]Alright.
[342:44.91]Just blow up a sun.
[343:01.89]I'm sorry.
[343:07.95]It was open in the other window.
[343:12.16]I'm sorry.
[343:12.76]I had to put Larry David in there at the very end.
[343:23.58]Victory screech.
[343:24.61]Uh oh.
[343:30.94]It's the absolute truth.
[343:51.48]Kingdom Hearts.
[344:09.86]I'm just shit so bad.
[344:28.33]I'm not even kidding.
[344:29.61]I don't know what happened in like the 10 seconds I started this.
[344:33.25]Oh my god, what?
[344:38.87]I don't know why they crept up so hard on me.
[344:42.77]Oh, we have to, okay, let's go, let's go.
[344:44.65]The absolute truth.
[345:22.39]I can't hurt it.
[345:22.91]I'm just gonna queue it up.
[346:03.77]All these lives you have destroyed.
[346:57.05]Who was wrong?
[347:03.64]Oh shit, I gotta fight this guy.
[347:40.54]Whatever you say.
[347:41.12]I don't know.
[347:46.73]Don't do that.
[347:47.51]Not now.
[348:16.01]Oh, you can do better than that.
[348:17.53]You can do better than that.
[348:38.06]Playtime is over.
[348:41.30]You thought you got away?
[348:46.14]With no physical constraints.
[348:49.25]We have the upper hand now.
[348:53.73]My hands are sweating and I have to shit.
[348:55.11]I'm gonna shit my pants.
[349:37.72]What?
[349:39.24]This has gone too far.
[349:40.64]Pink?
[349:44.43]Red has been helping us.
[349:46.11]We just didn't know.
[349:49.75]But they killed us.
[349:51.67]Yes, they did.
[349:52.95]They did what I couldn't do.
[349:56.96]I thought... This person's naked.
[349:58.74]This person's naked.
[350:00.32]I thought by not killing...
[350:03.57]We should not fear death.
[350:05.61]I've read that so wrong.
[350:08.21]I'm a little on edge right now.
[350:09.33]I'm kind of like a lightning bolt.
[350:10.53]It's been really kind of tricky to pay attention.
[350:18.06]I feel like somebody just put a blow dryer in my face for 15 straight minutes.
[350:22.40]Do I have to keep going?
[350:24.41]What, are you on Adderall?
[350:25.57]No, I just like, that was crazy.
[350:27.85]There was so much going on.
[350:43.22]You still going?
[350:45.72]I can't understand how you went through with this monstrous act.
[350:48.78]You're the only one with powers to kill in a world of immortals.
[350:55.29]Against their will, you took their lives.
[350:57.51]That's not true.
[350:59.83]Half of these people were like, Yes, please kill me!
[351:02.41]Hooray!
[351:02.99]I'm happy!
[351:03.91]What do you mean against their will?
[351:05.49]Like, 70% of the people were happy I was doing this.
[351:11.84]Was it my purpose to kill everyone?
[351:13.00]What do you mean that's not true?
[351:16.92]Half the people were like, yeah, here it is, I'm happy, thank you.
[351:20.14]I was being thanked.
[351:23.53]Was I sent here on a mission?
[351:24.87]Have I forgotten my destiny?
[351:25.95]Don't be mistaken, I have thought about this for many years.
[351:30.77]So many wanted to end their lives and didn't struggle.
[351:33.57]Even if they had asked me, I don't think I could have killed them.
[351:38.04]What are you talking about?
[351:40.30]You were the one that killed us!
[351:42.67]What?
[351:42.89]No.
[351:43.71]It was the doll.
[351:45.86]The doll body was burned up in the incinerator, Pink.
[351:50.72]But as always, the main problem was that... What was it?
[351:54.60]The main problem is something that... You were in there.
[351:56.32]That was the issue.
[351:57.54]You were inside.
[351:59.14]To cope with losing your body, you create an illusion.
[352:03.90]What?
[352:05.14]Don't go.
[352:06.10]No!
[352:06.46]After everything, you were still the killer.
[352:12.80]No, it wasn't me.
[352:13.60]It was not me.
[352:15.04]I did not kill you.
[352:16.86]I did not do that.
[352:18.42]I did not hit her.
[352:19.92]I am stuck here now.
[352:21.82]Was this all a test?
[352:23.28]I cannot do this alone.
[352:25.10]Please, Red, you have to help me.
[352:26.40]I beg you, you have to help me.
[352:28.46]I cannot do it alone.
[352:29.38]Who is it?
[352:44.04]Is Daffy Duck gonna come over here with a pencil in his hand and be like, Don't erase me!
[352:49.48]You're an idiot!
[352:50.28]And I'm gonna start drawing shit on him?
[353:01.83]Thank you.
[353:12.82]Not the entire body, but it will have to do.
[353:14.64]Control me like you have always done.
[353:20.58]Please guide me.
[353:25.10]Is that the Konami code?
[353:28.42]I guess.
[353:32.42]Where do we go?
[353:34.32]Is it really all in my head?
[353:38.86]No, it couldn't have been.
[353:40.16]I know you're out there.
[353:42.83]What if I... You'll be my eyes.
[353:47.79]I trust in you, human.
[353:49.59]Guide me out of this hellscape.
[353:54.20]It works.
[353:55.48]I can't believe it.
[353:59.74]Sorry.
[354:00.82]I'll remain silent.
[354:05.79]As long as I trust you, you can guide me... Shut up.
[354:08.29]You just said you were going to stop talking.
[354:26.80]Cool.
[354:30.84]What's the frog?
[354:31.44]What do you want to do?
[354:35.63]Journey is almost over now.
[354:37.11]Do you want to save?
[354:38.13]Yes.
[354:41.87]Great.
[354:42.31]Good luck.
[354:42.61]Thanks.
[354:48.32]What do you want to do?
[354:49.82]Hello, Pink.
[354:51.34]Hi.
[354:52.50]Knowing you've accomplished what I asked of you makes me a very happy frog.
[354:57.48]Your biggest challenge is yet to come.
[354:58.80]So please, stay and relax until you feel ready.
[355:04.26]Let me know if you have any questions.
[355:06.72]Okay.
[355:06.94]I mean, I've got quite a lot of questions, actually.
[355:12.62]What is beneath... behind that?
[355:14.24]Beyond there lies the end of your journey.
[355:17.71]I don't understand.
[355:18.31]I can give you a hundred different explanations for what's behind that door.
[355:22.20]But in the end, you're gonna come out the birth canal either way.
[355:25.52]So, it don't matter what I say.
[355:26.90]You just have to find out.
[355:31.50]Okay.
[355:38.91]Where are we?
[355:39.37]We're not in the physical world anymore.
[355:41.47]We're not in the end either.
[355:42.93]We're in a sort of waiting room.
[355:44.99]A place where you can collect yourself and come to peace.
[355:48.86]I'm fine!
[355:49.50]I don't have to- I'm fine.
[355:51.73]Like, I heard- I felt the gurgles for a minute, and now I'm fine.
[355:54.31]Don't worry.
[355:56.95]Was I not supposed to do that?
[356:01.42]I'll admit, I did not expect this.
[356:04.73]I'm sorry.
[356:05.25]Don't worry.
[356:24.50]If you're fine, then gamble on a fart.
[356:30.50]Why are you just assuming and implying that I have to do that?
[356:33.71]I don't need... I don't have to do that.
[356:43.85]I'm just kind of walking right now.
[356:49.43]Nothing here.
[356:49.91]Oh, please.
[357:06.61]So what is the final boss then?
[357:19.89]It's gonna be me.
[357:22.09]It's gonna be me.
[357:33.09]It smells horrible.
[357:34.88]Let it happen.
[357:35.66]Oh, no.
[357:36.88]Did I shit my pants?
[357:39.68]It's cold.
[357:40.30]What?
[357:41.28]It doesn't feel good.
[357:43.18]It's uncomfortable.
[357:44.00]I didn't mean to.
[357:47.40]No, no, I won't.
[357:55.94]I just killed him.
[357:56.56]Age will always get you, human.
[357:58.14]But some of us found a way out.
[358:01.94]But it requires immense determination.
[358:04.44]The only way for you out, Pink, is to surrender yourself.
[358:07.44]But I think you already knew that.
[358:11.84]I have what it takes to save Pink.
[358:14.00]Yes.
[358:15.04]Good.
[358:15.50]You see things through.
[358:17.60]That is a good trait.
[358:19.36]But it's far from over.
[358:21.89]Look into the darkness.
[358:23.23]Face the abyss.
[358:25.91]Get your pants.
[358:27.75]Just do it.
[358:40.11]Water's getting deeper.
[358:40.87]It's cold.
[358:42.25]It doesn't feel good.
[358:42.93]It's uncomfortable.
[358:46.73]It hurts.
[358:47.96]Everything is burning.
[358:52.05]I've got a problem.
[358:54.59]That's way... That's a... There's a few too many Taco Bell Diablo sauces on that.
[359:13.96]Eagle funny.
[359:14.70]I know.
[359:15.31]Trust me.
[359:16.03]I get it.
[359:18.07]What happened?
[359:31.32]I'm coming out the birth canal.
[359:34.42]I told you.
[359:37.40]It's been some time since we last saw each other.
[359:40.29]Alright.
[360:05.28]Shit.
[360:26.24]We're all good friends and we all get together sometimes When you're feeling down and you're feeling out of luck and out of change We will work together and we will have... I'm sorry.
[360:38.76]That's what I expected.
[360:40.06]That's what I expected.
[360:41.06]I expected that.
[360:52.58]You have to understand, I can't hear anything.
[360:55.04]I can't even hear my own thoughts.
[360:58.14]I don't even know what I sound like right now.
[361:01.18]I've probably been talking so loud this whole playthrough because I can't hear anything.
[361:07.09]There's a vacuum cleaner going behind me.
[361:09.39]And in front of me.
[361:10.49]And on both sides of my ears.
[361:19.34]It has not been easy.
[361:21.94]But you made it into the... What is this?
[361:24.73]You have fought... Am I Jesus?
[361:27.29]You've fought well, Jesus.
[361:30.75]Most important thing.
[361:32.38]Coming up here.
[361:33.78]It's still left.
[361:34.54]And you... Whoa.
[361:38.64]Whoa.
[362:03.81]We're going upside down again.
[362:05.29]Hey.
[362:22.11]Stop doing that.
[362:26.80]We are reaching the end of time.
[362:37.91]Okay.
[362:42.14]Okay.
[362:44.00]Can somebody press the tracking button on the remote, please?
[362:49.05]I'm trying to watch The Simpsons from 1990 fucking 3.
[363:20.32]Give me something to shoot at him.
[363:21.34]What the fuck?
[363:23.88]Will you behave?
[363:24.86]I don't know.
[363:39.10]Give me a bow and arrow to shoot at him, please.
[363:55.13]Am I the Big Bang or something?
[363:56.49]Am I a planet?
[363:58.06]Farewell.
[363:58.58]Thanks.
[364:29.57]My god, what are you doing game?
[364:33.95]When you're out of luck and you're out of friends Let me be the one to show you
[365:09.37]So long.
[365:31.66]It's still going?
[365:32.56]Am I getting looped?
[365:34.14]Am I getting pitied?
[365:41.64]Oh, shit.
[365:42.54]Don't lose now.
[365:55.81]Stop shaking the screen.
[365:58.91]Stop doing this, please.
[366:00.91]I can't see anything.
[366:06.50]Oh, my God.
[366:09.90]Bro!
[366:11.42]Bro!
[366:16.66]Bro!
[366:17.60]Bro!
[366:20.40]Come on, bro!
[366:23.51]Dude, what the fuck?
[366:27.03]I can't even, like, see anymore.
[366:29.51]I literally can't even see.
[366:35.97]Somebody's just screaming into my brain.
[366:48.93]It's like somebody hitting me in the back of the head with a hammer every 10 seconds.
[367:04.24]There are WoW raid bosses that are not as long as this.
[367:09.03]I remember Ragnaros took like 40 minutes.
[367:11.95]I don't want to do that again.
[367:26.75]Alright, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[367:27.61]I'm good, I'm good.
[368:04.48]I don't want to see it anymore!
[368:25.78]No!
[368:52.00]Stop it!
[368:53.32]Stop!
[368:58.45]Dude, who wants to do that?
[369:00.65]Oh my god, hey, hey, you wanna do this again for another five straight fucking minutes?
[369:09.80]Stay strong, stay determined!
[369:12.86]Fly into me.
[369:13.82]Fly out of me.
[369:15.02]Because you're a baby and you're about to be in the universe.
[369:17.30]I don't know.
[369:17.72]Whatever the fuck this is.
[369:18.80]I'm about to put it on easy just to see the end of the game.
[369:31.15]My face is itchy.
[369:32.91]I'm losing my mind.
[369:33.77]Alright.
[369:33.97]Wait.
[369:34.25]Stop.
[369:34.53]Stop.
[369:34.67]Stop.
[369:34.77]Stop.
[369:34.97]I got it.
[370:07.43]Stop!
[370:07.79]Alright, if I make another sound after this, I'm gonna gift a thousand subs.
[370:15.41]Until the end of the fight, okay?
[370:18.45]Starting now.
[373:01.23]Bye.
[373:56.96]I can talk?
[373:59.16]Okay.
[374:04.90]I did it.
[374:07.79]I almost screamed when it just did that.
[374:09.31]What happened?
[374:15.31]Where am I?
[374:17.55]When it did that second part right there, I almost screamed, but I was like, oh my god, I can't scream.
[374:23.13]Am I dead?
[374:23.63]Am I dead?
[374:28.28]What am I?
[374:36.90]And you fart directly in- I'm not gonna even say anything, because why do I read those?
[374:41.88]Do not worry.
[374:43.58]You have done well.
[374:44.28]This is the end of this life.
[374:46.62]Before we venture forward, I have something to show you.
[374:57.24]Mhm.
[375:06.43]It's gonna be Earth.
[375:08.91]I created Earth.
[375:17.42]You're awake.
[375:21.70]You did it.
[375:22.56]Apparently I did it.
[375:23.38]You freed everyone from the immortal realm.
[375:28.27]Welcome to the waiting room.
[375:29.45]This is the place of reconciliation, the place after death.
[375:35.48]And the end of the game.
[375:41.62]This was the good end.
[375:43.74]It's been an absolute joyful experience to see you on this journey.
[375:52.09]Some have waited for you here.
[375:53.99]Wow.
[375:55.51]Okay.
[376:05.41]This is the good ending.
[376:08.67]I actually was supposed to do this.
[376:09.97]Look!
[376:11.21]Thank you for freeing me.
[376:12.48]You are truly a great warrior, but this world still has secrets left to uncover.
[376:15.96]Alright, I'll die.
[376:21.24]I've lost everything.
[376:22.14]The world doesn't exist.
[376:23.16]I'm not really me anymore.
[376:24.44]All these things I used to care about, they don't matter.
[376:27.52]In a strange way, I feel relieved.
[376:34.53]I can't believe there was another world after death.
[376:36.11]I thought everything would just stop and turn black for all eternity.
[376:40.18]Maybe an eternity has already passed.
[376:43.44]I don't even know anymore.
[376:44.74]I'm glad it seems there is more to life than what I thought.
[376:53.40]I feel stupid.
[376:53.98]I thought we were already in the afterlife.
[376:55.51]But I'm happy there's another journey coming.
[376:56.73]I'm a bit sad that I've been quite accustomed to my body.
[377:01.53]Existed for eons.
[377:02.83]Maybe some change is good.
[377:04.91]Must have been hard for you to kill everyone.
[377:07.27]I'm glad you took the role of Reaper.
[377:08.71]Here comes the birth canal.
[377:13.09]Yeah, I'm telling you.
[377:14.31]Sometimes when it gets really quiet, I hear a voice.
[377:17.87]I can't decide whether it's nice or something.
[377:19.49]Whatever.
[377:21.41]I have a nice journey.
[377:23.38]Everyone's getting birthed.
[377:26.00]I knew you had it in you.
[377:26.74]It gives me great pleasure that you were able to free the souls, including his, by the way.
[377:32.04]Everyone did that D face when I did it to him.
[377:35.69]But look what I did.
[377:36.29]Wait, why are you not going?
[377:45.07]You had a reason for coming here, didn't you?
[377:48.03]Even as we are ending our chapter.
[377:49.41]A strange feeling there is more to this world.
[377:54.03]Alright, there you go.
[377:55.23]On.
[377:55.57]Go on.
[377:55.89]On with you.
[377:57.71]Across to the other realm, I see.
[377:59.09]It'll be a pleasure showing you this world, Red.
[378:01.74]Unfortunately for you, human, you'll not be joining us tonight.
[378:04.98]But don't worry.
[378:05.86]Your time will come soon enough.
[378:07.24]Goodbye.
[378:10.54]You've done well.
[378:12.00]What a strange place you have brought me to.
[378:16.54]Hi guys.
[378:46.96]I was shocked with everything that happened, but I'm happy with how it all turned out.
[378:49.90]I think Flan is happiest of us all.
[378:51.48]Is it you, Red?
[378:56.84]You've changed quite a bit.
[378:58.33]How long has it been since we saw each other?
[379:00.09]I can't tell.
[379:03.49]I know we didn't leave on good terms.
[379:09.41]But I wanted to let you know that I'm thankful for what you did.
[379:14.56]Jerma's ready for it to end when he stops doing voices.
[379:20.58]Yeah, if you're new to the channel, hour number like one, two, and three is like, oh, it's me, Jerma.
[379:27.56]Oh, hey, it's me.
[379:28.42]I've had a great life and lots of friends.
[379:30.78]When you get to hour number four and five and then six and seven, it's like, here, it's me.
[379:35.50]We're just hanging out.
[379:37.96]You can feel the energy levels like sap from my body.
[379:41.99]I've had a great life with lots of friends and fun, but when I was alone, I didn't have such a great time.
[379:47.34]Anyway, happy you helped me.
[379:49.66]Yeah, end of the stream voice.
[379:50.68]That's how you can tell.
[379:54.72]Do we have to send everybody, or... I did a good job.
[379:59.26]Looking forward to a reward.
[380:00.29]This is it, huh?
[380:05.91]What was the point of that?
[380:07.39]I got some thinking to do, Red.
[380:08.69]Or whoever you really are.
[380:14.96]Red.
[380:15.24]Hi, Blue.
[380:16.42]I'm so happy to see you again.
[380:19.50]Once I died, it felt very cold and everything became dark and it got a bit scary.
[380:23.66]But after a while, that frightful feeling disappeared.
[380:25.94]And when I opened my eyes, I was here.
[380:28.12]I knew you weren't a bad guy.
[380:35.01]All these people are respawning in the freezer.
[380:39.41]Oh, we're going over.
[380:40.13]Oh, I didn't know I was an immortal.
[380:42.05]He's sending us over.
[380:43.67]He's sending us over to the next realm.
[380:45.54]I didn't know I was an immortal.
[380:51.00]Knowing that, there is more.
[380:52.32]You still have like a cold up here?
[381:02.68]Send him to the birth canal.
[381:07.88]I wonder where we will appear now.
[381:10.34]Wait, are they gonna like appear as like animals and humans and like bugs and stuff?
[381:15.84]How do I know that I'm not just like having them reincarnate as like a beetle?
[381:22.00]Could have believed that there was more to it all.
[381:24.14]I'm so thrilled.
[381:25.06]I assume the world would just cease to exist.
[381:27.27]Plop, and then nothing, you know.
[381:30.85]This is truly astonishing.
[381:40.23]I've never got the chance to truly meet you.
[381:42.45]For so many years, no, for so many decades, I've been living in a world of terror.
[381:45.97]I was held prisoner by Professor Orange.
[381:49.37]They gave me things so I wouldn't, couldn't leave.
[381:51.83]I'm just happy it's all over now.
[381:54.67]But I do feel regret.
[381:55.73]Regret that I didn't take it into my own hands and free myself from Professor Orange.
[382:01.62]If I had just gathered courage, I could have, I don't know.
[382:05.06]But still, I'm very happy I'm finally free now.
[382:15.01]I am thankful.
[382:17.91]I was hurt.
[382:21.22]You.
[382:22.28]You helped me.
[382:23.54]Professor Orange, not so nice.
[382:26.88]To me.
[382:27.24]Alright, so we're sending this guy to hell, right?
[382:33.83]Send him to hell.
[382:34.37]Everybody else down here?
[382:34.99]We got everybody down here?
[383:05.49]What about the street lamp?
[383:11.35]Okay.
[383:13.26]Thank you for everything.
[383:13.92]Do you want to save?
[383:14.82]Yes.
[383:16.10]Right here.
[383:17.90]Amazing.
[383:18.36]Okay.
[383:18.72]I'm going to save your progress.
[383:21.22]No.
[383:23.75]I can't kill him.
[383:32.44]Alright, only a few more people up here.
[383:33.96]I think this is it.
[383:39.46]Who's that?
[383:44.43]A Roblox character?
[383:45.51]This whole game was made in Roblox?
[383:57.95]You did well.
[383:59.95]You can finally know peace.
[384:00.93]It wouldn't have been possible without you.
[384:07.04]Seems like a good place for a fresh start.
[384:08.56]You can call me... Fridge.
[384:10.32]No, wait.
[384:11.64]Hanbi.
[384:12.42]When you killed me, I was like, this is where it all ends.
[384:14.72]But then I didn't.
[384:15.33]I'm ready for something new.
[384:21.03]I will be honest with you, Pink.
[384:22.13]I never expected the afterlife would look like this.
[384:24.43]It's been nice, but I do feel a bit sad.
[384:26.27]Are you sad?
[384:27.17]No?
[384:27.85]You have a heart of stone, you know?
[384:29.97]Maybe that's how you were able to do it all.
[384:33.43]We're just... We're sending them over in their essences and energies...
[384:37.90]We're gonna fire a laser and blow up a planet.
[384:39.94]That's like what we did.
[384:40.66]The whole thing was for that.
[384:44.18]Bye.
[384:44.40]Get out of here.
[384:49.15]He didn't leave.
[384:49.61]I'm sorry for attacking, Pink.
[384:50.89]I thought I did the right thing.
[384:53.41]It's both exciting and a bit... Whatever that word is.
[384:56.27]It starts with an M and ends in elancholic.
[384:59.77]Oh, melancholic.
[385:00.93]Like melancholy.
[385:02.47]We're going to leave this realm.
[385:04.15]I've lived for so long, yet I feel like there's so much more for me to discover.
[385:08.00]Thank you for all the good times, Pink.
[385:10.46]Thank you, Rasta Beast.
[385:12.54]You're always looking out for me.
[385:18.59]You need to get out of here.
[385:21.33]Alright, nothing gets past you.
[385:22.25]Alright, fine.
[385:22.77]I'm out.
[385:25.45]That'll be gone.
[385:25.91]Alright, we cleared it out.
[385:29.58]Nobody left.
[385:37.73]I've put everybody on.
[385:41.09]Now it's time.
[385:43.15]Hello, human.
[385:44.45]Are you ready to end the game?
[385:46.59]Yes.
[385:48.60]It's been a spectacle watching you.
[385:50.92]Let us say farewell in a way it deserves to end.
[385:55.70]Oh my god, more.
[385:58.20]Do I have to fight God now?
[386:02.13]You kidding me?
[386:09.49]I don't want to fight God.
[386:10.95]I don't want to fight God.
[386:16.56]Everyone's leaving.
[386:26.17]Am I gonna try to hurt them?
[386:27.75]Or are we gonna dance over the credits?
[386:51.19]How come it's just those guys?
[386:56.06]I want the whole cast.
[387:25.94]Alright, alright guys guys guys, okay, I'm done.
[387:31.19]I'm done.
[387:31.69]I'm really tired Everyone go live your next life and ship.

[389:59.36]Yes, and what a... I'm so happy there's more.
[390:06.80]Like, I'm just waiting for this to cut, and we're in a giant bus, and we just, like, go off a cliff.
[390:14.76]Oh, we're gonna venture beyond the... And then it just cuts to, like...

[391:10.81]See you later!
[391:22.52]Please stop thanking me.
[391:23.98]Yeah.
[391:25.58]One thank you is enough.
[391:26.61]I don't need to hear more than one thank you.
[391:34.67]Here we are.
[391:35.21]At the end of the road.
[391:37.65]We have witnessed an eventful journey.
[391:39.63]Many words have been said.
[391:40.69]Some thoughts have been shared.
[391:45.57]Before you leave, do you wish to hear the last absolute truth?
[391:52.06]Sure.
[391:53.62]What is it?
[391:55.16]There are no absolute truths.
[391:58.78]Ah, yes there is.
[391:59.50]Chocolate is delicious.
[392:01.45]That's an absolute truth.
[392:02.23]Nobody can describe that.
[392:02.97]You're free to wrap your half-truths into whatever.
[392:07.13]No.
[392:07.29]That is the true beauty of it.
[392:12.25]You can make the rest up.
[392:19.26]You still have a long time- nah, that's not a good idea.
[392:21.70]That's not a good idea, because that's how like Facebook and Twitter got so fucked up.
[392:25.48]No!
[392:26.30]No, no, don't- let's focus on truth, please.
[392:36.36]You still have a time left, and some time after that.
[392:40.48]No, don't- oh yeah, the thing about truth is it just make a bunch of shit up, who cares?
[392:44.62]Who cares about that truth stuff?
[392:57.98]That's not what it means.
[393:02.09]There's no Facebook dude in heaven.
[393:06.41]Oh, how do you know that?
[393:07.85]You don't know that.
[393:08.83]You don't know what it is.
[393:09.69]You don't even know what it looks like.
[393:10.95]You want the alien rant again?
[393:15.12]Take care of yourself.
[393:15.90]Thank you.
[393:16.22]A friend.
[393:17.18]Oh, God.
[393:23.24]What the fuck is happening?
[393:26.20]Come and visit us again.
[393:36.54]It never ends in Everhood.
[393:38.77]New game plus.
[394:01.45]Alright, I'm going to give you my full, my opinion.
[394:03.77]Played through the whole game, took about seven and a half hours.
[394:06.54]I'm going to tell you.
[394:08.32]I believe that that was, that was very solid.
[394:15.94]I would say that was a, that's a highly recommend.
[394:18.00]That's very good.
[394:21.37]It was definitely worth playing, for sure.
[394:30.13]That was, that was very good.
[394:42.67]What about a rating?
[394:47.90]New game plus for the good ending.
[394:49.54]I don't think so.
[394:54.76]Game grew on me a lot after I beat it and thought about it more.
[394:57.82]Please write to us and tell us how our game made you feel.
[395:01.20]Our email is in the store page.
[395:03.02]I'll tell you right now.
[395:03.76]It made me feel... I had a lot of emotions.
[395:06.80]It made me feel all kinds of things.
[395:09.10]Like, what is life?
[395:10.50]What is death?
[395:12.76]This game contains flashing lights.
[395:13.94]It can be dangerous.
[395:19.10]Uh, no, it's very good.
[395:24.06]Oh, this is, this is now looks different.
[395:29.07]What happened?
[395:38.93]Uh.
[395:41.37]Oh, you can replay battles.
[395:42.51]That's cool.
[395:48.15]Alright.
[395:48.67]I think I'm going to call it here.
[395:52.35]That was really good.
[395:53.53]Now I understand why everybody said, dude, don't just drink half a bottle of wine and play the first level.
[396:00.33]I get it.
[396:01.71]That was a very, very fantastic time.
[396:03.71]I had a great time.
[396:05.62]Hope you did too.
[396:09.18]The next time that you see me live, I will see you on the 20th.
[396:16.54]Over the next four or five days, I've got a lot of stuff I need to do, a lot of work to do, especially on the big stream that's happening on the 1st of February.
[396:28.25]A lot of stuff to do.
[396:30.42]On the 20th, that's Thursday, we're going to play Hitman VR.
[396:35.20]It releases on the 20th.
[396:37.32]I'm very excited for that.
[396:38.74]I feel like that's going to be a lot of fun.
[396:45.42]And I will see you guys later.
[396:52.65]He's stalling?
[396:54.39]The stream is over, man.
[396:57.95]But yeah, Hitman VR will be the 20th.
[397:00.03]I'm assuming I'll... Here's one thing I want to make really clear about the VR streams is because the last time I did VR, I kind of really had a lot of trouble and a lot of problems afterwards.
[397:10.74]So what's going to happen with those streams is I'm probably only going to be in the headset for like maybe two or three hours each time.
[397:19.11]I just physically can't do more than like three, four hours in the headset.
[397:22.79]I just can't.
[397:24.59]So...
[397:26.90]For those of you that don't know, I have some medical issues with my chest and back.
[397:33.76]Even seated VR probably would be too much.
[397:39.25]Probably two or three hours.
[397:41.83]Maybe I'll push it a little more past three if I'm having a great time.
[397:45.78]But the 20th, we'll do it again maybe on like the 22nd or something, 23rd, 24th.
[397:51.99]I will do it a few times in a row, but just not a whole lot of time in the headset in a row.
[397:57.79]Like in the same setting.
[398:02.41]It should be fun.
[398:02.88]I'm looking forward to it.
[398:06.62]You should go back to Everwood and try the pacifist run.
[398:10.88]Maybe I'll do that on my own time.
[398:15.39]But thanks for hanging out.
[398:17.41]Hopefully you guys had a good time.
[398:19.87]And we'll see you again in four or five days on the 20th.
[398:25.31]It's man time for that.
[398:26.89]Let's go.
[398:28.67]I'm going to say four o'clock Pacific.
[398:34.05]That might come back to like two or three, depending on if I can get my sleep schedule in the right spot.
[398:39.21]But plan on four, although it could be pulled back to like something as early as two or three.
[398:45.15]I really want to get back on that, like, 2 p.m.
[398:46.75]Pacific schedule.
[398:48.37]Because it is right now pretty late for everybody.
[398:51.25]Not just, um, the East Coast.
