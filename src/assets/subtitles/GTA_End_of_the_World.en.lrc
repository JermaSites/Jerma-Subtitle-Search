[00:05.82]It's been a long time.
[00:07.36]Oh my god!
[00:08.40]Why is Sonic the Hedgehog here?
[00:18.62]Yeah, no.
[00:19.34]Through that tiny hallway?
[00:25.36]No!
[00:25.98]Get back here, Sonic.
[00:27.11]You stole my money.
[00:28.71]Wait, where did the car come from?
[00:30.77]I don't know.
[00:31.13]I don't even want to look.
[00:32.84]I don't want to solve that.
[00:34.74]They're just coming through the walls.
[00:37.08]Oh, what's down here?
[00:37.72]What is that?
[00:38.44]I don't care about Sonic anymore.
[00:39.56]That's a safe spot.
[00:40.30]You can hide in there.
[00:44.97]These guys.
[00:47.69]Get the paramedics.
[00:48.93]We got an innocent.
[00:49.97]What?
[00:51.75]What?
[00:52.23]Get the paramedics.
[00:53.31]We have a skeleton man over here.
[00:55.03]He needs help.
[00:56.69]There's another.
[00:57.25]I gotta get out of here.
[00:59.45]It's coming.
[01:05.22]Uh huh.
[01:13.91]It doesn't make any sense.
[01:19.35]This is just, like, insane.
[01:23.29]There's another B.I.
[01:24.11]Rowling.
[01:24.41]There's just B.I.s everywhere.
[01:26.69]Oh, my mom's calling me.
[01:30.99]No, Mom, I'm busy right now.
[01:32.53]There's kind of a Carmageddon going on.
[01:33.99]Are you kidding me?
[01:34.55]Your mom's probably calling you.
[01:36.94]You didn't answer the phone call for your mom?
[01:38.94]She's probably like, son, where the fuck are you?
[01:40.84]It's Carmageddon.
[01:41.48]Get out of here.
[01:46.68]It's the aliens.
[01:47.64]They're responsible for Carmageddon.
[01:49.86]Really?
[01:50.18]Can you believe this?
[01:50.90]I just, like, Carmageddon, we were just supposed to take over the Earth.
[01:56.10]I gotta get out of here.
[01:57.46]Carmageddon, Carmageddon, call it in.
[02:00.58]The end of the human race.
[02:02.68]There's people just walking with him.
[02:03.86]Look at this guy to the left.
[02:04.92]Yeah, you piece of shit.
[02:06.31]Yeah, get it.
[02:07.03]Fuck you, alien.
[02:07.83]I don't know why I think this is so funny.
[02:14.03]Because he's just going to, like, throw up.
[02:15.47]Hey!
[02:15.73]I'm walking in.
[02:16.47]No!
[02:37.88]This is so broken.
[02:41.17]There's nothing in existence anymore.

[03:30.40]Get out of here.
[03:31.54]There's no place for her.
[03:32.80]Oh, my god.
