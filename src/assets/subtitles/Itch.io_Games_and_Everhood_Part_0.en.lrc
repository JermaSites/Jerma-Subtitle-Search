[00:02.22]Hello, everybody!
[00:04.14]Welcome to the Christmas Eve stream!
[00:08.50]I am ready to rock and roll.
[00:12.08]Oh, what's up?
[00:12.84]What's up?
[00:13.59]What's up?
[00:17.75]Good to see everybody again.
[00:21.39]Uh... I don't... Alright, I turned on the stream, I think, already.
[00:27.35]Nah, I'm kidding.
[00:27.89]How you doing?
[00:28.63]Welcome, welcome.
[00:29.31]How are you?
[00:29.71]Welcome to the stream.
[00:30.35]Good to see you.
[00:32.87]Merry Christmas.
[00:33.41]It actually might be Christmas in some parts of the world right now.
[00:39.87]Very possible.
[00:40.54]What time?
[00:42.74]It's 4.30.
[00:42.86]5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.
[00:43.08]It is almost Christmas in EU.
[00:58.72]Hey, man, keep it down.
[00:59.42]I'm trying to sleep.
[01:01.08]Wake up!
[01:02.12]It is.
[01:02.38]Oh, it's Christmas right now.
[01:03.70]Alright.
[01:04.48]Yeah!
[01:10.83]How is your peppermint mocha?
[01:11.93]Okay, let me just... I have to explain.
[01:13.81]And I'm still suffering right now, by the way.
[01:17.41]So... I was in the Christmas spirit.
[01:23.21]I was very, very excited for the holiday.
[01:24.89]Okay.
[01:26.74]So, you know, you get flavor for a coffee.
[01:30.32]You get like one of those creamers.
[01:31.54]And I got peppermint mocha flavored creamer.
[01:36.99]Like, oh, this is fucking Christmas time.
[01:38.37]Let's go.
[01:39.81]So, I mean, I drank like three of them.
[01:43.17]Three coffees with it in it.
[01:46.37]And it was delicious, by the way.
[01:51.25]Then I had to go to the bathroom.
[01:53.19]And I'll be very, very honest with you.
[01:54.72]I had to go to the bathroom again.
[01:58.05]What?
[01:59.03]We hold it for the stream because it's Christmas Eve and I- I'm holding it for Santa.
[02:09.38]It's one of those things that comes in waves, uh, for those of you that understand and can catch my drift.
[02:17.48]I'm fine, I'm kidding, oh my god.
[02:20.76]By the way, I have no idea what I look like.
[02:23.90]Um...
[02:25.53]This is gonna be a surprise to all of us, I think.
[02:28.13]This is gonna be a shocker to all of us.
[02:33.23]I'm just gonna look at the preview and see what I look like.
[02:47.75]It's a blistery day here!
[02:51.43]Father Christmas?
[02:54.54]how fucking much older I look and look at how wet my hair is still I haven't shaved look at how like I look like it okay it you'd probably think I got hacked if you saw the thumbnail right if you saw this thumbnail it's like who's who's this guy on germa's channel and why is the channel hacked
[03:19.10]It's my secret identity.
[03:22.31]Yeah, this is like this bullshit disguise that, yeah.
[03:26.33]I'm Superman, by the way.
[03:27.67]I just put on glasses, put my hair back, and have a mustache.
[03:32.51]God, I should just fucking leave halfway through the stream and play a video of like a bus getting rescued or something.
[03:39.19]Hold on to that one.
[03:39.85]Imagine I'm just sitting here just playing normally.
[03:42.83]I'm just like, oh, wow, look out.
[03:46.89]Oh, nice, headshot.
[03:49.53]And then be like... Headshot!
[03:55.26]Hey guys, I gotta take a quick shit.
[03:56.94]It's diarrhea, so it's gonna be like probably half an hour.
[03:59.02]And then I fucking get up.
[04:01.72]And then I come back, and people link me a video.
[04:04.93]Oh my god, did you see what happened?
[04:06.09]And it's like... Me, without the glasses and a superhero outfit, like saving a bus full of children.
[04:16.51]Dressed up like a therapist.
[04:17.89]I'm not gonna wa- This is loud, by the way.
[04:20.10]I'm not gonna wear this.
[04:21.20]This is just for you to take a screenshot, because I can't put these on.
[04:24.86]This- It just seems weird.
[04:26.14]I feel like I have a VR headset on.
[04:28.38]Without the VR in front of me.
[04:29.66]Because there's no lenses in these.
[04:35.27]You know how some people look, like, much better with glasses?
[04:37.65]What's the reverse?
[04:38.55]What's the reverse?
[04:45.54]Please wear it.
[04:46.28]I don't think I can.
[04:54.99]I've got that light back up here too, which is not doing me any favors.
[05:02.39]Fucking wine mom.
[05:05.47]And I've got two kinds of chapstick.
[05:07.51]I really am fucking 40.
[05:10.89]Okay.
[05:15.61]So, here's what we're going to do.
[05:16.87]I almost look like I'm going to cross-eyed.
[05:23.07]Yeah, these are coming off.
[05:23.81]I'm not fucking wearing these.
[05:28.98]Those are coming off.
[05:31.40]So, I have...
[05:34.29]A bunch of itch.io games that I want to play.
[05:36.69]Some of them are Christmas themed.
[05:37.65]Some of them are horror.
[05:38.69]Some of them are fun.
[05:39.83]Some of them are weird.
[05:40.81]We're just going to do a bunch of them.
[05:42.91]I don't know how long I'm going to be here.
[05:44.51]I don't know how long this is going to take.
[05:46.67]No idea.
[05:47.57]All I know is that I got my wine here.
[05:49.83]I've got my... Oh, I'm going to turn this on.
[05:54.15]It's going to get toasty in here.
[05:55.07]I guarantee it.
[05:57.19]Oh, let me move this.
[06:01.80]Come on, turn it on.
[06:03.44]Turn it on.
[06:05.58]Turn it on!
[06:06.54]There we go.
[06:09.94]Okay.
[06:10.82]Hold on, let me move this.
[06:12.10]Let me move that.
[06:13.86]Move this.
[06:14.28]Let me move that.
[06:16.68]Let me move this.
[06:17.76]I've got like an empty coffee mug here I want to get rid of as well.
[06:21.45]Alright.
[06:22.43]I think I'm ready.
[06:26.69]You just turned off the PC?
[06:30.99]You know, hold on.
[06:32.31]I think I have to be right back for a minute.
[06:37.23]Yeah, I got a BRB for just a second, guys.
[06:43.85]Yeah, BRB.
[06:46.05]Just one second.
[06:47.21]Just a minute or two.
[06:58.48]Merry Christmas!
[07:05.28]Did you get one?
[07:05.82]Did you get your present?
[07:08.19]I'm trying to make it around the clock.
[07:09.43]I'm trying to get there.
[07:10.15]There it is.
[07:19.48]I told you we were going to get one for winter and one for Christmas.
[07:23.70]Just in time for the holiday.
[07:26.80]Got one of our new BRB screens and I love it.
[07:36.01]We're gonna use this for like at least a week or two.
[07:37.81]I don't even care if it's Christmas is over.
[07:42.19]You see the characters in the background?
[07:44.73]Can you count?
[07:50.97]Is that Grandpa?
[07:51.67]That is Grandpa down there.
[07:52.87]Yeah, Blordow made this.
[07:59.25]Got it done and out and ready.
[08:03.72]Uh, we're just in time here.
[08:07.04]So that's going to be the BRB screen that you will see from now on for the next week or two.
[08:17.51]And now, we can actually start the stream.
[08:19.53]I wanted to show that, though.
[08:20.55]I thought it was really cool.
[08:24.83]Now, don't mind, like, the scary music that's here now.
[08:29.01]We're playing a scary game.
[08:30.53]It's called Santa's Cookies.
[08:31.83]It's the first of the Ichio Night.
[08:35.33]And I think we can begin.
[08:38.05]I think we can begin.
[08:38.93]That's a pretty good Cabernet Sauvignon.
[08:47.40]What year is it?
[08:49.98]What year is this?
[08:54.58]Last week.
[08:57.07]2022.
[08:59.05]Whatever it is.
[09:01.99]It's a vintage.
[09:02.71]I got it a week ago.
[09:05.18]Evil hair.
[09:05.68]I look evil today.
[09:06.50]Are you ready?
[09:07.06]Are you ready?
[09:07.52]This is like a... Oh, but we want you to play horror games.
[09:09.34]All right.
[09:09.96]Well, the only time I'm going to play horror games right now is... A lot of community subs are coming in too.
[09:13.16]Holy shit.
[09:13.54]Thank you, everybody.
[09:16.46]That's way too much.
[09:17.79]Don't give me... Stop giving me money.
[09:19.87]I demand it.
[09:20.29]That's 100 community subs from Zixia.
[09:21.91]Merry Christmas.
[09:23.27]Stop giving me money.
[09:23.95]Don't give me any more.
[09:25.74]I'm going to be very upset with you.
[09:27.76]Don't give me any more money.
[09:28.70]I'll be very upset with you.
[09:30.47]Is this thing in the right spot?
[09:31.29]What does it look like without this?
[09:33.29]I don't know.
[09:35.31]Alright, here we go.
[09:38.43]Are you guys ready to rock and roll for the Christmas Eve extravaganza?
[09:41.23]Itchy-o extravaganza wine mom night?
[09:44.49]Let me drop this.
[10:01.33]Should I do two headphones for this?
[10:02.79]I think my face cam's too big.
[10:03.75]Yeah, I was right.
[10:10.19]Uh, Zixia, that's insane.
[10:11.27]100 community subs.
[10:13.07]So many community subs are coming in.
[10:15.03]Don't give me any more money, thank you, but that's a huge amount.
[10:17.39]20 from Animos.
[10:18.09]40 from Animos.
[10:20.61]Let's fucking go.
[10:21.37]Santa's cookies.
[10:22.91]Ready to rock and roll.
[10:28.71]Turn it up.
[10:39.81]The game crashed.
[10:41.13]Shit.
[10:41.47]That's my fault.
[10:42.75]That's my fault.
[10:43.41]I fucked it up.
[10:48.80]I'm ready for this one, though.
[10:50.26]I fucked it up.
[10:50.78]Hold on.
[10:51.08]Try it again.
[10:57.22]Okay.
[11:03.62]Santa's cookies.

[12:57.45]Is he right outside?
[13:04.99]What am I supposed to go?
[13:06.27]Okay.
[13:16.44]I don't see him.
[13:28.24]What am I supposed to be doing?
[13:31.58]I think I have to take... Oh, I got milk.
[13:34.24]Oh no, I don't have a glass.
[13:35.32]I think I have to fill this with milk.
[13:40.87]Can I just put it in the sink?
[13:42.45]It's your fucking mom and dad anyways.
[13:44.05]Who cares?
[13:44.41]I'll just put it in the sink.
[13:46.83]Am I crouching?
[13:47.47]Can I hide in here?
[14:07.28]Why did I get jumped on so quickly last time?
[14:11.86]Where's our house?
[14:22.61]Oh shit, there he is!
[14:23.71]Where's his hat?
[14:25.97]Oh shit, close the door.
[14:27.87]Where do I go?
[14:28.61]What should I do?
[14:29.93]This is not even Santa, this is just Dad walking around.
[14:40.50]Hide?
[14:40.78]Hide where?
[14:42.76]Can I go under the bed?
[14:43.58]There's a sprint.
[15:10.78]I don't see him down here.
[15:13.32]Oh, milk!
[15:19.69]Presidents, hold on.
[15:20.37]There's milk, milk, milk, milk, milk!
[15:21.57]Put it down.
[15:26.77]Alright, I got the milk on the table.
[15:28.81]Oh my fucking god, there he is.
[15:29.75]What if I go?
[15:31.63]What if I go?
[15:35.72]He's going back up the stairs.
[15:36.90]I think I'm okay.
[15:38.82]So I have to put the cookies up there too?
[15:47.36]Oh, there's a cookie.
[15:57.13]Oh, shit.
[15:57.93]I think I missed.
[16:10.48]I hope Santa doesn't have any peppermint mocha coffees this morning like me.
[16:23.17]I think I'm alright.
[16:24.03]I think I probably leave now.
[16:25.35]It plays the music when he's there.
[16:43.56]Where are the other cookies?
[16:48.90]Relax.
[16:49.32]Holy shit, dude.
[16:50.31]Are you kidding me?
[16:51.41]This is not even scary.
[16:53.51]Did I just fake that?
[16:54.51]No, I really didn't.
[16:55.25]I swear to God.
[16:55.77]But, like, that was way overreacting.
[16:57.29]I haven't played a scary game in a long time.
[17:01.59]It's been a very long time.
[17:02.59]That was way overacting.
[17:03.53]You know what I mean?
[17:04.65]I gotta go back to acting school.
[17:07.23]You guys think it's gonna be funny that, like, in ten years, when actors, like, don't even want to be actors anymore, they just want to be streamers, there will be workshops on how to, like, react to a jump scare.
[17:22.21]I could teach that class.
[17:28.40]Alright, that was Santa's cookies.
[17:29.48]It was pretty good.
[17:34.85]We're going to stay in this same realm, I think.
[17:37.75]We might as well get them out of the way.
[17:42.07]This one's called The Christmas Incident.
[17:43.75]We'll find out.
[17:54.89]Return of Scare Saturdays?
[17:55.99]Well, I mean, it just, I feel like it'd be fun.
[17:59.28]Christmas Incident.
[18:00.30]This one looks weird.
[18:03.62]All these games were got on itch.io, by the way.
[18:06.14]I think I'm gonna have to capture my monitor.
[18:10.14]Let's see.
[18:16.49]Uh, there it is.
[18:17.23]All right, this is called The Christmas Incident.
[18:26.96]Settings.
[18:28.32]I'm going to turn this way fucking down.
[18:30.08]Alright.
[18:30.81]20 should be alright.
[18:31.41]Play.
[18:31.79]Turn it up.
[18:39.45]Have you met Santa?
[18:43.44]Okay, we got it.
[18:44.36]Can I get the sensitivity menu back?
[18:46.46]Because this is way too low.
[18:52.00]Every game has wicked shit sensitivity, though.
[18:56.37]Hold on, I gotta fix this.
[18:57.67]This is not gonna happen the way that it is right now.
[19:00.27]Looking for a game to capture.
[19:01.39]Well, there isn't one, so just wait.
[19:06.77]Okay.
[19:13.02]Fucking didn't even do the sensitivity!
[19:14.76]God damn it!
[19:19.87]every game that's ever released ever always have when you the mouse sensitivity you have to do 0 to 10 or nothing at all right like anything over 10 is unusable I'll get it this time okay hold it I'm gonna keep it at 50.
[19:44.63]The Christmas miracle.
[19:45.77]That's better.
[19:46.23]Alright.
[19:47.03]Can we give an actual clap to this dev?
[19:49.85]Whoever you are.
[19:51.93]You are better than every single AAA studio that makes mouse sensitivity awful.
[19:56.76]Alright, so let's go.
[19:59.78]This is kind of creepy.
[20:06.80]Both headphones in.
[20:07.54]I know I'm cheating.
[20:09.09]Have you met Santa?
[20:12.03]Yeah, I've met him.
[20:18.63]Maybe once or twice.
[20:25.81]Pick up flashlight.
[20:30.95]Okay.
[20:32.91]There's no FOV slider.
[20:37.13]What the hell is going on?
[20:39.41]You hear that?
[20:48.09]It's creepy.
[20:49.19]Okay, I got a game coming up that I'm really not looking forward to playing.
[20:51.83]There's a game that I'm going to play in a little bit.
[20:55.60]That is considered one of the scariest, most unbearable itch.io experiences.
[21:01.24]It's by that puppet... Puppet combo.
[21:06.08]It looks so... I'm not fucking ready.
[21:10.57]It looks so horrible.
[21:11.63]I don't know if I want to do it.
[21:15.56]But this low poly shit is way scarier than like a hundred zombies running at you in Resident Evil.
[21:21.54]They gotta go back to this stuff.
[21:22.58]They really do.
[21:23.10]It's just so unsettling.
[21:28.37]Enter house, press E. Hold on.
[21:39.12]Ah, it like looks like 3D Movie Maker, which makes it worse.
[21:47.25]What am I looking for?
[21:47.99]Just investigate?
[21:48.65]There are people talking.
[22:02.20]Can you hear them?
[22:06.52]There are people eating dinner.
[22:11.25]Where are the people?
[22:20.95]What radio station just plays the inside of a restaurant on a Thursday night?
[22:24.55]I don't know.
[22:31.55]Okay.
[22:43.59]Beepy.
[22:43.71]Can I turn the flashlight off?
[22:58.48]Alright, nothing in here.
[22:59.16]Oh, there is something in here.
[23:05.85]There's a bloody knife.
[23:13.59]Bro.
[23:20.48]Alright, now over here?
[23:21.60]Wait, yeah.
[23:24.02]This is where I came in.
[23:24.66]Do I need to pick up any candy?
[23:26.44]Is this an elevator?
[23:27.10]Why is there an elevator?
[23:41.37]You painting on the toilet?
[23:42.55]Oh, I thought that was an easel.
[23:43.69]I was like, you're doing like a fucking piece of artwork while you're taking a shit?
[23:50.49]Why is there a mirror in here?
[23:58.64]That's so weird.
[23:59.66]Can you imagine just like squatting down here and just like on your phone and just going like this?
[24:07.42]That would be so weird looking.
[24:09.24]What do you mean squatting?
[24:21.57]How do you go to the bathroom?
[24:22.61]What are you talking about?
[24:24.53]When you squat down to take a shit.
[24:26.72]How do you go to, what are you talking about?
[24:29.40]You know, you just stand on the toilet seat.
[24:32.28]You sit.
[24:32.88]Yeah, squat, sit.
[24:34.50]Like, you know what I mean?
[24:37.62]Squat, have a squat.
[24:39.82]What happened to my pop stand?
[24:40.76]What the fuck's going on?
[24:42.64]You squat.
[24:55.23]It looks fucking weird.
[24:56.93]I'm not gonna drink that way.
[25:05.86]Do I have any backstory here?
[25:10.90]It's a horror game, guys.
[25:12.13]Where's the notes that are everywhere with, like, three pages of exposition?
[25:18.37]Where's the open diary with, like, fucking four pages of what happened yesterday?
[25:22.23]Okay.
[25:24.12]This is, what do you think, this is a horror game?
[25:28.12]Ooh, a big key.
[25:35.79]I like this.
[25:37.81]I love... I don't know.
[25:39.77]I think it's so cool that over the last, like, ten years or so, that we've been able to have indie devs have been able just to make whatever the fuck they want.
[25:46.99]It's really cool.
[25:52.17]Is there a sprint?
[25:52.70]There is not a sprint.
[25:59.40]I got a key, though.
[26:00.02]Was there a locked door?
[26:03.40]Oh, shit!
[26:12.68]Oh!
[26:12.96]There is a present waiting for you under the Christmas tree.
[26:15.99]Is that Iron Maiden?
[26:24.17]Why are there just, like, the Olympic fucking rings?
[26:26.61]What?
[26:27.97]What are these?
[26:30.23]There's a present waiting for you under the tree.
[26:31.51]Alright, there's a person lying here.
[26:52.27]Okay.
[26:56.39]I'm like unsettled right now.
[26:58.01]Go get the present.
[27:10.17]That's the wrong way.
[27:10.89]Oh, shit.
[27:11.45]Okay, I thought there was a hallway that went this way.
[27:17.07]That would be so funny to the kill.
[27:18.57]Like, to the killer, though.
[27:19.63]Like, you run that way.
[27:21.89]And you stop and you go, oops, sorry, never mind.
[27:26.84]What am I supposed to do?
[27:34.88]Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[27:45.65]Trees downstairs.
[27:46.29]Put the tree over here.
[27:58.66]All right, he's not just hiding back there, right?
[28:10.00]Go get your present under the tree.
[28:11.54]He's going to just grab me and scream in my face.
[28:13.50]I know it.
[28:15.01]Where's my present?
[28:19.93]You forgot to put your eyelashes on.
[28:24.04]I forgot something.
[28:43.48]Is he running?
[28:44.04]Stop making that fucking noise!
[28:51.44]Where is he?
[29:01.23]Is it the front door?
[29:01.93]Or is he upstairs?
[29:15.82]This is different.
[29:30.67]Dude.
[29:35.27]Oh, no.
[29:35.81]I'm gonna get lost.
[29:37.31]I'm gonna get lost in here.
[29:38.11]Okay.
[29:45.08]What the fuck is that sound?
[29:48.03]Don't startle the witch.
[29:49.23]Oh, I don't like, I hate this shit so much.
[30:00.76]Why do, like, you know, can I tell you something?
[30:03.40]I need to talk about this for a second before I get scared.
[30:06.51]What the fuck is wrong with humans?
[30:09.11]The lengths we go to to entertain ourselves and like stimulate our brains.
[30:15.83]What the hell am I doing here?
[30:17.53]Why are we doing this?
[30:20.55]Humanity goes so far to desperately try to stimulate our brains to a point where we like pretend we're locked in a murderer's house and there's blood everywhere and we're gonna get fucking killed.
[30:38.53]Guys, even just the notion of the firework is enough to be like, what are we doing?
[30:44.83]Oh, yeah, man, I got an idea.
[30:45.83]Let's just make explode stuff.
[30:47.06]Like, just make huge explosions in front of everybody.
[30:49.92]Like... Why?
[30:52.80]Why are we doing this?
[30:53.96]You're high already?
[31:10.54]What happened?
[31:11.10]What the fuck was that?
[31:12.00]I didn't do that!
[31:13.26]Why did my light just do that?
[31:15.10]Why did the lights just go out?
[31:16.42]I'm not... Look at my hands!
[31:18.40]Why did the lights just turn off?
[31:20.33]Why did the lights just turn off?
[31:36.92]That was scarier than the game.
[31:40.53]Is the house haunted?
[31:41.53]Did somebody hack my computer and, like, hack my house and turn my lights off in my house?
[31:47.95]I feel like that was somebody here.
[31:49.07]32-bit holiday jam 2021.
[31:53.61]Good work.
[31:55.97]That was fun.
[31:59.64]Special thanks to the Unity Asset Store.
[32:03.74]Good shit.
[32:04.10]That was fun.
[32:08.13]It was quick.
[32:08.65]It was fun.
[32:09.21]It was weird.
[32:10.03]I like it.
[32:10.53]It was good.
[32:10.89]Good work.
[32:13.41]First Miss Incident.
[32:16.73]I love the low poly.
[32:17.65]I think it's fantastic.
[32:19.21]You look genuinely concerned.
[32:22.19]Bro, the lights just turned off in my room and I didn't fucking flick a switch.
[32:27.68]That wasn't a routine.
[32:28.98]That wasn't a bit.
[32:29.78]I did.
[32:30.06]Alright, let's keep going.
[32:32.94]Moving on.
[32:33.26]I think there's one more like this that I want to do.
[32:42.13]We've got, okay, I gotta make sure I remember which ones we did.
[32:44.69]That was the Christmas incident.
[32:46.77]We did Santa's cookies.
[32:50.87]The next one coming up is sleigh bells.
[32:53.87]Sleigh bells.
[32:57.21]Hopefully it's not loud.
[32:58.10]Be careful.
[33:12.48]Stop breaking my immersion, OBS.
[33:18.09]Another low poly one we got here.
[33:19.71]Sleigh bells.
[33:22.75]Why is everyone saying yes?
[33:28.43]Why am I wearing... What did you say?
[33:31.97]Why are you wearing a 2013 turkey evil eye bath towel?
[33:40.61]That's so weirdly specific, I have no idea what you're even talking about.
[33:43.11]It's a nice sweater.
[33:46.27]I think it looks good.
[33:48.65]It's not an ugly Christmas sweater.
[33:50.09]This is a beautiful Christmas sweater.
[33:53.53]And I've got the game.
[33:54.93]I've got the game on.
[33:58.77]Yes, slay.
[34:06.09]You did this.
[34:16.50]Merry Christmas, everybody.
[34:17.22]You know, it's been kind of a fucked up year or two.
[34:20.14]It's been kind of stressful for everybody, I think.
[34:24.32]But, uh, let's hope we keep going.
[34:27.88]All we can do is move forward.
[34:28.66]And that's it.
[34:33.03]Okay.
[34:36.67]I'm ready.
[34:37.45]Press any key.
[34:38.09]You got it.
[34:39.72]Click here to watch the making of this game, Sleigh Bells.
[34:45.00]Who made this game?
[34:47.72]By Blake McKinnon?
[34:48.54]Additional sound effects by Brianna McKinnon?
[34:51.87]Okay.
[34:55.77]Move, W, A, S, D, sprint to shift, attack.
[34:57.93]There's an attack.
[34:59.79]Left click, zoom, right click, F, E, and Q. Alright, let's go.
[35:06.96]Christmas Eve and I'm still taking my clothes off in this horrible town for money.
[35:11.72]Sigh, I better deliver Billy's Christmas present before it gets too late.
[35:14.67]I wonder if he even remembers what I look like.
[35:17.33]He hasn't seen me for months.
[35:19.89]Not since he went to live with his father.
[35:21.77]Why'd they have to take him from me?
[35:23.73]I miss my little Billy.
[35:24.97]Okay.
[35:31.50]Toggle your flashlight.
[35:32.98]F.
[35:39.75]I like the music.
[35:47.64]I'm gonna go this way.
[35:49.04]There's a stamina meter.
[35:49.86]You know when you put lip balm on and then your skin starts peeling off on your lips?
[35:55.72]What's up with that?
[35:58.90]Earn objective.
[36:01.26]Deliver Billy's present.
[36:02.38]Is this zoom?
[36:02.96]Okay.
[36:09.49]I thought they were just gonna fucking crash me.
[36:12.77]Oh, I was gonna get, I didn't get it because it was, the file was so huge for like a two second joke.
[36:18.53]I was gonna hit, gone home, but you're a car.
[36:22.61]It was making me laugh.
[36:23.57]I was like, this is fucking, I like this.
[36:26.22]But imagine if I played that, okay?
[36:30.54]Is that you, Billy?
[36:40.92]Where's Billy?
[36:41.86]Where's my house?
[36:48.32]Who are these people?
[36:50.49]Oh, snowman!
[36:51.13]That's a pretty damn good snowman, I gotta tell you.
[36:59.89]The hair in my wine.
[37:00.67]I don't care.
[37:01.77]I'll drink it.
[37:02.21]I don't care.
[37:02.53]Doesn't matter.
[37:04.82]You guys know you eat over an inch of dirt every single meal.
[37:07.60]You know that?
[37:12.44]You eat over an inch of dirt every single meal.
[37:17.38]Weird.
[37:19.04]Every time you've ever eaten, you're always eating over an inch of dirt.
[37:24.79]Because you're at least about a foot off the ground at the dinner table, aren't you?
[37:30.75]Use that joke at Christmas and your family will laugh, I guarantee it.
[37:34.58]You're always eating at least an inch over of dirt.
[37:38.04]At least, you know what I mean?
[37:40.20]At least you eat over an inch of dirt means you at least eat over the inch of dirt.
[37:44.32]Get it?
[37:46.60]You guys don't get it.
[37:51.20]Oh, bet somebody at a bar $100 that.
[37:52.30]You'll win.
[37:55.94]Oh, deliver.
[37:58.82]I think this is it.
[38:00.74]Okay.
[38:03.10]I'll just leave the present here.
[38:04.02]I doubt they'll want to see me right now.
[38:05.44]I better get home before it gets too late.
[38:07.32]I don't want to be out after midnight.
[38:08.62]Are you minus two-ing that?
[38:18.53]I just made everybody here $100.
[38:19.59]You're not going to minus two when somebody has to pay you $100 because you proved to them that you eat over an inch of dirt every meal.
[38:30.52]People fucking money.
[38:31.16]Whatever.
[38:32.86]Fine.
[38:37.51]Oops.
[38:40.61]Alright.
[38:41.05]Merry Christmas, Billy.
[38:41.77]I better get home.
[38:49.73]Chat is pissed.
[38:51.55]He'll get over it.
[38:52.53]I've made worse jokes.
[38:55.44]You're new here.
[38:56.02]Don't worry.
[39:03.50]In fact, eventually here, over the next 12 hours or so, you'll be able to vote for what your favorite worst joke was for the last year.
[39:12.90]Keep it on my Twitter.
[39:15.06]Worst joke of the year is a category.
[39:21.76]Do I have an objective on the map?
[39:25.94]Make your way home.
[39:26.83]Okay.
[39:27.77]Where do I live?
[39:39.30]Where do I live?
[39:39.76]What if I don't know where I live?
[39:51.05]Subway.
[39:56.96]This is blocked off for some reason.
[40:01.80]I wonder what's going on up here.
[40:03.54]I won't be getting home this way.
[40:05.07]I'll have to go through the subway tunnel.
[40:07.29]It's not that much further.
[40:08.49]I'm gonna get fucked up today, by the way.
[40:13.45]Just wanna make sure everyone knows.
[40:32.06]Alright, go through the subway.
[40:33.20]Easy.
[40:33.42]Alright, here we go.
[40:41.83]I gotta go through the subway.
[40:43.93]I gotta walk the whole subway train line thing.
[40:46.91]And it's loud too.
[40:48.43]Is it alright?
[40:48.99]What does this say?
[40:56.21]Hot sausage.
[40:58.21]Cat and the mouse experiment.
[41:02.80]Blake McKinnon film.
[41:06.72]Is this guy, is this guy made like a horror movie?
[41:08.20]All right, Blake, let's see what you got.
[41:15.49]Let's see what you got.
[41:19.45]Merry Christmas.
[41:20.33]Merry Christmas to you too.
[41:26.64]I just licked my lips because I'm a lip licker.
[41:28.66]I just can't stop.
[41:29.40]And I just tasted soap because I've been put... I'm trying to do this, man.
[41:35.99]I just... I gotta stop doing it.
[41:39.39]I'm such a... I'm a lizard.
[41:41.87]I swear to God.
[41:42.93]I'm so aware of it, too.
[41:43.75]It sucks.
[41:48.69]He's been disemboweled.
[41:50.22]What sort of maniac would do such a thing?
[41:52.08]I better get out of here before whoever did this comes back.
[41:55.54]Get out of the subway?
[42:01.18]Oh, there's a lot of ads for this guy's movie.
[42:04.65]There are more ads for this guy's YouTube horror movie than Spider-Man No Way Home.
[42:13.31]Advertiser budget is probably pretty high for this one.
[42:17.38]This is loud as fuck.
[42:18.26]Is that alright?
[42:21.48]Which way should I go?
[42:30.62]I don't think I should go that way.
[42:34.74]Why is that even scary?
[42:35.92]Like, I mean, it's weird that there's a... Like, if I saw Santa, I'd be like, oh.
[42:40.69]I'm safe.
[42:43.21]Santa will protect me.
[42:44.97]From the fucking scary monster that's here.
[42:47.75]I wouldn't be scared of Santa.
[42:55.34]Alright, do I have to run?
[42:57.52]No.
[43:00.79]How the fuck did you get over there?
[43:02.25]What happened?
[43:03.09]What are you talking about?
[43:09.55]What?
[43:19.32]I wouldn't be scared of Santa.
[43:21.04]I would hope Santa would be the one protecting us.
[43:23.76]If Santa's the one with the axe, we've got a lot of problems.
[43:29.55]We got way more problems than we think.
[43:39.17]Okay.
[43:39.83]So what am I supposed to do?
[43:41.79]Just run away?
[43:42.25]So what the fuck, man?
[43:47.98]Do I go buy him?
[44:01.45]Oh shit, it's always a bathroom.
[44:07.63]Punch?
[44:10.48]What if I just punch him in the face?
[44:22.23]I honestly think this.
[44:23.89]If an old man was coming at me with a big axe, I would just snap his neck and win.
[44:30.88]An axe is not a great weapon.
[44:32.24]Alright, I'm dead.
[44:43.48]I wouldn't be afraid of an axe.
[44:44.53]I really wouldn't.
[44:47.51]An axe has this, like, one point that's heavy, you have to swing it.
[44:50.57]I would be able to dodge it, and I would just go dodge underneath him, and grab him by his chin here, and his top of his head here, and I would snap his neck.
[45:01.30]It would be easy.
[45:04.16]Axes are not good weapons, seriously.
[45:08.78]So, okay, I gotta follow the arrow, somebody said.
[45:13.98]What the fuck he...
[45:20.46]See what I'm talking about?
[45:21.72]This guy can't even hit me.
[45:22.96]Don't turn around.
[45:23.66]Don't turn around.
[45:24.58]Don't turn around.
[45:25.26]Get out of the subway!
[45:26.62]Get out of the subway!
[45:27.98]Get out of the subway!
[46:08.51]Oh, holy shit look at that Whoa what the fuck that's so cool.
[46:16.73]I don't know you could do that I Need a crowbar to get out of the subway where the fuck is the crowbar oh?
[46:36.21]I need a crowbar to get out of the subway.
[46:45.64]Bathroom?
[46:46.08]I knew you were gonna go right.
[46:51.48]Where's the crowbar?
[46:52.24]It has to be the bathroom.
[46:53.60]Oh, down here?
[47:07.68]What the fuck?
[47:09.04]He's killing policemen.
[47:10.18]Crowbar?
[47:11.38]I don't see a crowbar.
[47:13.00]Oh, fuck it.
[47:13.48]Out of here, dude.
[47:14.72]Where is the crowbar?
[47:15.82]Oh my god.
[47:16.36]Eat.
[47:36.59]Can I hide?
[47:39.19]I have no idea where I am right now.
[47:41.11]I'm just going in circles.
[47:42.25]Wait, he's on the map.
[47:43.45]No, he's not.
[47:43.89]What the hell is going on?
[47:44.81]Crowbar!
[47:45.45]Crowbar!
[47:46.33]Crowbar!
[48:07.92]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[48:10.44]Oh my god, dude.
[48:11.74]Give me a break.
[48:12.48]Come on.
[48:13.04]I don't even know where... I don't even know where that was.
[48:19.62]Is there a crouch?
[48:32.59]Is there a crouch?
[48:41.11]I gotta hop... Okay, I gotta go right?
[48:42.89]I don't want him to see me.
[48:45.31]Don't... Okay.
[48:48.67]He'll walk by and I can go around.
[48:51.01]I'm high as fuck right now.
[48:52.23]As long as that's legal in your jurisdiction.
[48:53.67]And you're responsible about it, I'm okay with it.
[49:01.71]This is too loud.
[49:02.43]I'm turning it down.
[49:03.15]Fuck it.
[49:09.03]If I can go around and hide... You!
[49:12.29]Oh, yeah.
[49:13.47]Pre-fire.
[49:14.01]Ban this person from the lobby, seriously.
[49:16.69]Oh, you piece of shit.
[49:17.51]Give me a break.
[49:23.41]I remember it's down here.
[49:24.33]I gotta... Okay, lock this in long-term memory, please, Jeremy.
[49:27.45]Here?
[49:36.51]I see blood.
[49:38.44]It's literally right.
[49:39.40]No, it's left.
[49:41.60]You stupid motherfucker.
[49:42.90]I'm gonna get through this.
[49:59.35]It's the stamina that's killing me.
[50:00.67]It's right.
[50:01.21]So you go right, straight.
[50:02.85]Alright, I'll get it.
[50:04.48]And then I gotta get to the exit too.
[50:08.40]Is it the flashlight?
[50:09.22]I'm gonna flash that off.
[50:27.37]Okay, down... Right.
[50:29.99]He doesn't know where I am.
[50:35.41]Right where- I don't know where I am.
[50:36.78]Where am I?
[50:44.78]Ah!
[50:45.76]Okay, I don't- I forget everything.
[50:51.55]Fuck you!
[50:52.21]Give me a break!
[50:52.87]What?!
[50:53.19]Right here?
[50:59.80]Okay.
[51:10.51]I made it.
[51:11.85]Warm us up.
[51:17.11]Then I gotta go down here and leave the subway.
[51:23.07]Don't turn- I'm not gonna turn around.
[51:24.46]No way.
[51:32.55]This looks like a Roblox mod.
[51:34.29]It's low poly.
[51:39.64]Just give me a checkpoint, please.
[51:41.84]Oh, shit, my light.
[51:45.34]My light.
[51:45.70]Hold on a second.
[51:47.06]Whoa!
[51:48.26]If the game's paused, he can't hurt me, right?
[51:53.44]My light's fucked up. ...
[52:04.92]Just... I'm trying to be professional for once in my goddamn life.
[52:07.88]Oh!
[52:08.04]Alright, now what?
[52:08.74]Find your way home.
[52:34.88]It's very quiet all of a sudden.
[52:36.52]I wonder where everyone has gone.
[52:47.04]A gulp.
[53:02.95]Oh, the weather outside is bright.
[53:06.59]I got fire, solar light.
[53:10.59]Since we, since we no place.
[53:13.82]Hold on.
[53:15.16]Since we no place.
[53:16.80]I'll get it.
[53:17.62]Shut up.
[53:19.14]Since we no place to go.
[53:22.12]Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow.
[53:25.57]Use that part.
[53:33.10]Like three people just got banned.
[53:34.26]I don't know what you did, but what the fuck are you doing?
[53:55.12]Oh, why do they have to keep locking this gate?
[53:57.48]Oh, that's not Santa talking.
[53:58.34]I thought it said Santa.
[54:01.34]Looks like damage.
[54:02.14]Can I break it?
[54:04.33]How would you not be able to break it with a crowbar?
[54:13.39]Why couldn't you not break it with a crowbar?
[54:15.55]I don't even have a crowbar anymore.
[54:17.05]The game took the crowbar from me.
[54:19.00]Are you kidding me?
[54:28.08]It's the flashlight.
[54:30.70]It coughs.
[54:32.29]There's a crazy guy running around with an axe.
[54:36.86]I think he's literally 15 feet behind me.
[54:39.06]He's gonna kill me.
[54:43.95]Oh.
[54:46.59]I should go file a police report.
[54:50.71]He's literally fucking 30 feet behind me.
[54:52.37]He's even got an axe.
[54:52.89]He's gonna kill me.
[54:56.21]Go to the station tomorrow morning?
[54:57.89]Okay.
[54:58.87]Tomorrow morning?
[55:00.25]Okay.
[55:02.16]Okay, thank you.
[55:02.78]Alright, thank you.
[55:14.57]So I need to find a weapon!
[55:25.24]Political Andy?
[55:28.14]I'm well lit for that one, fuck you.
[55:32.02]I need to find something that breaks this.
[55:33.52]Can I just punch it with my hands?
[55:42.47]How am I supposed to find something that breaks through a wall?
[55:44.59]I had a crowbar in my freaking hand.
[55:54.65]Go home.
[55:55.17]What do you think I'm trying to do?
[55:58.18]And how dare you talk like that to the streamer?
[56:02.30]Number one rule is respect the streamer always.
[56:04.62]How dare you?
[56:08.52]I don't want to activate this yet.
[56:12.01]There's got to be, like, a weapon or something I can find.
[56:14.35]Something to break the door.
[56:17.35]I don't want to turn that cutscene on because then he starts chasing after me.
[56:19.95]Hold on.
[56:24.43]Uh, it might show up on the minimap.
[56:28.10]Can I write your obituary in advance?
[56:30.82]And that person for an hour.
[56:35.52]I think I have to do this first.
[56:36.72]Okay, now it's like, oh, I can't get through here.
[56:38.38]Where is he?
[56:41.97]Where is he then?
[56:47.34]Alright, does it- is it gonna show up in the mini-map, something I can break?
[56:51.68]He just fucking hit me in the back!
[57:02.59]Oh, I'm so dead.
[57:06.95]Alright, I gotta find this- whatever this is first.
[57:13.22]Find something to break the door down.
[57:15.28]But wait, I don't know where to look.
[57:18.48]Blue dot on the map?
[57:20.56]There was only a yellow dot on the map, though.
[57:22.06]I looked.
[57:33.62]Sneak around.
[57:34.06]Okay, turn the flashlight off.
[57:40.59]What can I find here?
[57:43.59]Go through the window?
[57:44.37]Yeah, I'm not activating his spawn point here.
[57:50.13]Not yet.
[57:50.45]What about, can I jump up on stuff?
[57:55.72]Go through the window.
[57:56.86]You saw a window?
[58:01.08]It was a blue one just as you died.
[58:02.62]Really, was there?
[58:03.18]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[58:04.88]I'm going, I'm going.
[58:07.46]So I gotta run this way.
[58:08.38]Alright.
[58:08.82]Go.
[58:09.40]Go.
[58:13.96]Blue dot on the mini-map.
[58:19.60]Oh shit, I see it.
[58:27.73]Oh bro, I got an axe now too.
[58:29.01]You're fucked.
[58:29.51]AHH!
[58:41.78]I know what that is now.
[58:42.48]Alright, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[58:43.58]You suck.
[58:44.58]I don't.
[58:44.86]This game's hard.
[58:46.96]Shut up.
[58:48.92]Blanker.
[58:49.16]Alright, there it is.
[58:54.48]Right there.
[58:59.80]I see the blue dot.
[59:04.69]So get the axe first, and then I'm going for it.
[59:08.53]Do two hits and you're out?
[59:09.57]Yeah, well, it's kind of tricky.
[59:13.06]So, let me go get that first.
[59:18.49]That was, what, down here?
[59:19.63]Yeah, right here.
[59:25.61]So, I got the axe.
[59:28.49]Now, I shouldn't spawn him.
[59:29.39]I don't think he's going to spawn unless I get over there.
[59:33.39]You just hurt my feelings.
[59:34.19]I'm just kidding.
[59:34.65]I'm just messing around.
[59:38.78]Alright, let's go.
[59:48.46]Find your way home.
[59:53.65]Oh, shit.
[59:54.15]I live here.
[59:55.87]What?
[59:56.69]An eviction notice?
[59:57.63]They must have changed the lock, too.
[59:59.15]What?
[60:00.35]I need to get out of here before Santa finds me.
[60:02.63]The only way out of here is along the train tracks.
[60:07.21]I...
[60:18.40]Turn the flashlight off.
[60:20.52]Get myself killed here.
[60:21.34]Can I break this?
[60:33.66]Where is this motherfucker?
[60:34.49]I know he's here somewhere.
[60:38.15]Stairs onto the- Wait, the stairs.
[60:39.77]Go upstairs.
[60:40.27]I go-
[60:50.75]Where are the stairs?
[60:58.19]Stairs?
[60:58.53]Where are they?
[61:01.77]Where are they?
[61:06.78]Where are the stairs?
[61:12.06]Where are the stairs?
[61:12.60]I don't see them.
[61:15.44]I got here late.
[61:15.96]What was your Christmas gift?
[61:21.06]Is there a staircase up here that I didn't see?
[61:22.90]Where is it?
[61:23.28]Huh?
[61:41.05]Oh, there it goes!
[61:41.53]I just needed my glasses!
[61:42.73]I just needed my glasses!
[61:56.09]He's gonna be on the road here.
[61:58.19]Build sta- wait, I need, I, I, I, you know what I mean.
[62:00.49]Something's with my eye.
[62:18.85]My eye is burning.
[62:26.33]Two headphones going in.
[62:27.13]Fuck it.
[62:29.39]I'm going real mode.
[62:32.41]For all the new viewers, I don't wear headphones.
[62:34.29]I only wear one earbud.
[62:36.17]Because I'm like a baby.
[62:37.34]And like I get sensory overload and I can't think and I can't talk when there's sound going into both ears.
[62:44.22]So I have to do it like this.
[62:45.58]Otherwise I can't talk.
[62:47.80]I swear to God that's not made up bullshit.
[62:49.97]It's real.
[62:51.21]See, right now I'm like... I'm hitting a wall of talking.
[62:56.24]I can't do it.
[62:58.34]I hate it.
[63:01.48]I need to be aware of my surroundings.
[63:03.60]And I need to hear my surroundings.
[63:08.54]I would rather there be mono audio coming through here.
[63:12.71]Than stereo coming through here.
[63:14.11]And I don't get to hear the left side.
[63:15.59]It sucks.
[63:18.29]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[63:19.15]This is important.
[63:19.75]What's all the stuff on the mini-map?
[63:27.84]What's the green?
[63:28.88]There's a green thing on the mini-map.
[63:33.59]Oh, crowbar.
[63:34.37]Why would I get a- There's a gun.
[63:38.67]Gun.
[63:41.81]I have a gun.
[63:45.71]This guy's fucked.
[63:49.60]Eight shots?
[63:50.18]Alright, there's a crowbar.
[63:52.88]I think this is the final battle.
[63:55.31]This seems pretty Final Battle-ish to me, if I'm serious.
[64:00.07]What if I shoot him in the head?
[64:00.89]Does he just die?
[64:01.65]Escape via the train tracks, okay?
[64:16.60]See the gun- Why would I take an axe when I could get a gun?
[64:20.78]Sixteen shots.
[64:21.76]This guy is dead.
[64:29.12]Alright, where does it want me to go?
[64:30.29]Out here.
[64:34.27]Kill Santa.
[64:38.17]It is.
[65:01.64]He's dead.
[65:02.42]Just give me a whatever.
[65:03.42]I'm just gonna run around.
[65:05.40]I didn't know I had to shoot him that many times.
[65:09.02]Just a guy with an axe.
[65:10.00]If you shoot somebody in the head with an axe, this is gonna drop.
[65:11.92]Alright.
[65:16.49]Ammo.
[65:16.99]Let's go.
[65:28.43]Four, five, six, seven, eight, run.
[65:32.03]Ah!
[65:58.04]Oh, your AI is fucking stupid!
[65:59.68]I win!
[66:00.06]Oh, I don't have any bullets left.
[66:26.15]Fuck you!
[67:05.23]I need stamina.
[67:06.09]I can't run from him.
[67:06.83]I need stamina.
[67:07.31]He's an idiot.
[67:09.91]He's an idiot.
[67:11.49]He's an idiot.
[67:12.45]I got time.
[67:27.38]Bringing Todd his ammo?
[67:29.00]No, it's not.
[67:29.52]Shut up.
[67:30.06]Is it really?
[67:36.81]Fuck!
[67:37.75]Where's the gun?
[67:39.31]Where's the gun?
[67:39.77]Where's the gun?
[67:40.65]Where is he?
[67:41.01]What'd I do with the gun?
[67:48.61]What'd I do with the gun?
[67:52.08]Alright, he's dead.
[68:22.02]Alright, he's dead.
[68:23.98]I win.
[68:26.44]Poop face?
[68:27.68]That would be a really bad poop face.
[68:29.15]I feel like you'd want to go to the doctor.
[68:32.95]Immediately.
[68:35.29]Give me the gun.
[68:36.19]Alright, I got it.
[68:37.23]It's easy.
[68:38.35]I feel like the game will fuck up if I pick that up.
[68:46.06]Ammo.
[68:50.31]I thought the green was the plant.
[68:52.03]16.
[68:55.13]Let's get it all.
[68:56.65]You probably have to hit them every single time, though.
[69:00.81]It's probably like 30 shots.
[69:06.59]I thought it was something in the plant.
[69:08.01]I don't know.
[69:11.20]Alright, I have 24 bullets.
[69:16.36]Garbage day.
[69:17.16]That's an old meme.
[69:19.13]Alright, let's do it.
[69:20.29]24 shots.
[69:22.01]I'm not gonna shoot him yet.
[69:23.77]I'm gonna get him onto the tracks and walk him backwards.
[69:28.24]Here we go.
[69:29.24]Get the stamina up.
[69:37.79]Ready, boys and girls?
[69:40.19]It's time to win.
[69:48.99]Oh, he's dead.
[69:50.09]He's dead.
[69:50.57]Oops!
[69:50.81]I thought he... I'm an idiot.
[70:18.47]I fucking missed!
[70:26.47]OH MY GOD I'M GONNA BLOW THE WHOLE THING!
[70:52.50]Got him.
[70:56.40]Eat shit, Santa.
[70:57.74]You killed Santa.
[71:02.76]Merry Christmas.
[71:07.90]That's it.
[71:14.50]I like that one.
[71:14.96]That was fun.
[71:18.55]That was fun.
[71:19.73]That was good.
[71:20.49]That was good.
[71:21.09]That was good.
[71:27.73]That was fun.
[71:29.55]Do it again?
[71:29.99]Why would I do it again?
[71:31.45]Alright, moving on.
[71:40.47]Coming up next, I need to make sure I keep track of these.
[71:42.79]Any more Christmas ones?
[71:47.06]I think that's all the Christmas ones.
[71:55.28]I gotta pee.
[71:56.14]Anybody else have to pee?
[71:58.10]Go pee.
[71:58.50]We'll be right back.
[71:59.58]Pee break.
[72:00.40]Quick.
[72:01.18]And I kind of want to just put the BRB on.
[72:02.83]You know what I mean?
[72:09.07]I just like the BRB.
[72:10.11]All right.
[72:11.81]Two minutes.
[72:12.17]Be right back.
[74:09.74]Thank you.
[74:39.69]Okay.
[74:42.47]God, I love this.
[74:43.75]It's so cute.
[74:49.52]Go support Blordal, for the love of God, please.
[74:51.28]He's got a band camp.
[74:56.14]I'm not even here right now.
[74:57.84]Right?
[74:58.28]Like, the thing you're hearing and the thing you are seeing...
[75:03.45]is literally all Blordo.
[75:06.82]It's his music and it's his art and animations.
[75:09.86]So, go support Blordo.
[75:19.05]Alright, we're going to stay in the...
[75:22.78]I've actually seen this game played.
[75:25.73]So I can't tell you it's going to be like a completely... Oh, I've never seen it before.
[75:28.77]But I feel like it looked like fun.
[75:30.31]I didn't watch very much of it.
[75:31.41]We're going to play Night of the Consumers.
[75:36.10]It's a game where you have to like stock shelves or something.
[75:39.46]It's kind of scary.
[75:41.24]I don't know.
[75:42.00]I've seen it for like maybe 15 minutes of it so far.
[75:45.85]Looks like fun.
[75:50.85]And here we go.
[75:52.01]Coming back.
[75:52.35]Let me get this over here.
[76:04.50]Open it up.
[76:05.64]Should see it very momentarily here.
[76:09.83]I put on ultra graphics.
[76:10.95]Does that even matter?
[76:12.51]I'm not sure that even matters.
[76:19.27]Warning!
[76:20.05]This game contains... Hold on.
[76:26.31]Warning!
[76:28.83]This game contains a real retail experience.
[76:34.66]Night of the consumers.
[76:37.08]You don't stream in 1080, what's the point?
[76:40.92]Hit rate.
[76:41.22]1080.
[76:43.68]Not worth it.
[76:47.25]60 FPS.
[76:48.41]Awful.
[76:48.85]Looks awful.
[76:52.35]You need at least 10 to 20,000 bitrate to make 1080 look okay at 60.
[76:57.37]How many times do I have to tell you this?
[77:00.53]Alright, what are the controls?
[77:05.76]How do I play?
[77:11.22]I have no idea how to play.
[77:13.74]I have no clue.
[77:17.71]How do you do that?
[77:19.53]Lots of lonely nights in the mirror.
[77:22.65]Alright, here we go.
[77:30.74]Hey.
[77:35.74]Hey, you're late.
[77:40.29]I just fell down.
[77:43.05]You're late.
[77:45.25]But hey, since you're new around here, I'll cut you some slack.
[77:49.58]My name is the manager.
[77:52.92]We're not too busy on days like these, so you can have a nice, easy shift to help you get settled in.
[77:58.94]Remember, I got a reputation to uphold here.
[78:03.44]You won't have me looking like a fool in front of the other manager, would you?
[78:09.21]This store is the best in town, and I would like to keep it that way.
[78:14.17]If any of my local customers aren't satisfied with your service, I will be hearing about it.
[78:20.64]Now go find Jimmy.
[78:21.56]He's been working here for a while now.
[78:23.02]Very loyal employee.
[78:27.10]He'll show you the ropes.
[78:28.04]Put your stuff in the locker and get to it.
[78:34.15]Stuff in the locker.
[78:34.79]Okay.
[78:44.38]Alright, where's... I don't remember that.
[78:48.30]You alright, Jimmy?
[78:49.04]I can't take this anymore.
[78:50.60]I don't get paid enough for this.
[79:12.85]The rude customers.
[79:14.85]The endless amounts of sick.
[79:18.03]The shit stains.
[79:20.63]I've reached my breaking point.
[79:23.42]Listen up, it's up to you now.
[79:26.78]There's still a lot of empty shelves out there.
[79:29.84]They need to be stacked before we close.
[79:31.52]You don't want to upset manager.
[79:34.50]Here, take this.
[79:35.04]It's all the notes I've made while working here.
[79:36.83]Those tips saved me time and time again.
[79:38.55]Alright.
[79:40.01]Alright.
[79:45.29]I got notes?
[79:47.59]Hold shift is run.
[79:48.73]Left mouse is throw box.
[79:50.11]It stuns them.
[79:51.87]Right mouse is drop box.
[79:53.09]When you're stacking a shelf, A, D to look around.
[79:57.21]Hide in the staff room.
[79:59.01]Don't get caught.
[80:01.25]Okay.
[80:01.43]There's a sprint.
[80:14.40]Kitchen.

[103:40.06]Three.
[103:40.34]I'm 32?
[103:41.60]You got fucking time.
[103:51.19]You got time, man.
[103:51.99]Seriously.
[103:55.99]Guys, I couldn't even write like cursive until I was like fucking 31.
[104:00.64]So don't worry.
[104:03.40]I couldn't sign papers correctly until I was like fucking 30.
[104:08.38]Slow down.
[104:09.86]Not a race.
[104:10.26]Excuse me.
[104:24.04]Fucking baby, I hate this one!
[104:36.97]I forget where she was!
[104:42.09]Oh, thank Jesus on Christmas!
[104:59.98]Guys, I didn't even know what, okay, I always knew I wanted to be like an actor, right?
[105:03.82]And over the years, I, you know, oh.
[105:11.91]I want to be an actor.
[105:12.71]I want to be like a film person.
[105:14.23]I want to be like a director, right?
[105:18.82]But man, I really didn't, I was, I had no idea.
[105:25.27]Now, I know a lot of people on, let's be real.
[105:27.90]So, I know a lot of people on Twitch and YouTube, whatever, the people that you might watch right now.
[105:32.88]Um, they're a lot younger than I am.
[105:35.44]I started really late.
[105:36.40]There's a timer.
[105:38.63]Never mind.
[105:39.75]Fuck that existential bullshit.
[105:41.29]I got shit to do.
[105:41.93]I gotta, like, do this.

[105:48.45]Who gives a shit?
[105:49.40]Like, never mind.
[105:59.53]Front row, front row, front row, front row.

[112:02.36]That game's hard.
[112:03.46]That was fun, though.
[112:04.06]I liked it.
[112:05.82]That was Night of the Consumers.
[112:08.70]Yeah, we got a long way to go.
[112:11.70]The next one.
[112:14.08]What about the existential remark you were going to say?
[112:19.15]Oh, right.
[112:19.43]Yeah, okay.
[112:21.41]What was it?
[112:23.17]Listen to me.
[112:24.27]What was it?
[112:27.05]Existential bullshit?
[112:29.50]What was it?
[112:29.82]Eh, it wasn't important.
[112:35.07]No, for real though.
[112:37.29]I was like in my late 20s, dude, when I even fucking knew what I wanted to do.
[112:44.97]I made like TF2 YouTube videos and got like lucky.
[112:49.76]Trust me, I lucked out a lot.
[112:53.58]So, I was like 27 or 28.
[112:55.58]That's when I started.
[113:01.54]So trust me, you got plenty of time to figure it out.
[113:05.41]Alright, we're gonna play Slide in the Woods.
[113:11.87]This is a scary one.
[113:19.26]Yes, yeah.
[113:19.82]People saying yes, yes, yes.
[113:21.18]Okay.
[113:23.82]Point is, this is something called Late Bloomer.
[113:28.80]And... That's okay.
[113:31.42]Okay.
[113:33.22]And you don't even need to bloom.
[113:34.20]Who cares, right?
[113:34.98]Like, just try to live your life as best you can.
[113:36.79]I think a lot of people are too concerned about trying to make it.
[113:42.09]Trying to do this.
[113:42.81]Trying to make sure you do this certain thing.
[113:45.17]Just do your best.
[113:46.21]You know?
[113:48.21]You don't have to bloom.
[113:49.23]You don't have to.
[113:50.25]It's alright.
[113:50.67]You don't have to do that shit.
[113:53.98]Just try to live the best life you can with what you got.
[113:55.98]Alright.
[114:01.42]It's called Slide in the Woods.
[114:16.19]22 20 yeah a lot of you guys are younger like trust me dude I think about this I am like 12 to 15 years older than a lot of you guys I've been there before I I trust me I know in a long time you'll figure it out you'll find your place in the world
[114:40.11]But it doesn't have to be, like, extravagant.
[114:42.19]It doesn't have to be.
[114:43.05]Like, I think a lot of people... There's a lot of pressure, I think, on people now to have to do something extravagant.
[114:49.08]Like, you have to.
[114:50.82]No, you don't.
[114:52.76]You really don't.
[114:53.67]Like, just do you.
[114:55.59]That's it, man.
[114:56.59]Seriously.
[114:59.05]Too much pressure nowadays.
[115:00.29]Way too much.
[115:00.81]Did I just go down the slide?
[115:11.80]And trust me, the way you feel at like 17, 18, 19 will change into your mid to late 20s.
[115:20.30]Trust me.
[115:26.67]Scary monsters!
[115:27.87]Right?
[115:28.63]Sorry.
[115:29.73]Oh, no, never mind.
[115:30.27]I just went down the slide.
[115:32.31]Shut up, dad.
[115:32.97]I get to talk like this today because I got the fucking sweater on.
[115:39.90]You're 23 and you feel like shit.
[115:43.07]I remember being 23 and feeling like shit.
[115:45.53]Trust me, I remember.
[115:48.42]I remember.
[115:49.00]Can I go up this way?
[115:58.83]Don't put yourself under too much pressure.
[116:00.97]It's not worth it.
[116:02.05]It's not... Guys, I thought...
[116:06.65]When I was like 20, I thought I was like, I have to be a famous film director and famous actor.
[116:13.10]No, that's too much pressure.
[116:16.04]Just do what you can.
[116:18.12]If it fucking works out, it works out.
[116:19.46]If not, you'll find something to do.
[116:20.56]How many times do I have to go down the slide?
[116:32.47]No one likes you when you're 23.
[116:33.53]Wait.
[116:40.05]I got chronic pain, so do I. It fucking sucks.
[116:44.75]You know what?
[116:46.37]I'm here now.
[116:49.34]Hanging out with all of you.
[116:51.70]We're all here.
[116:52.22]Something changed.
[116:55.40]They all have the same flashlight.
[117:10.27]Thanks for the tip, Dad.
[117:12.07]You get it.
[117:12.65]I know a lot.
[117:13.55]You get it.
[117:14.01]Trust me.
[117:14.37]I know you do.
[117:15.83]Luckily, it still has battery.
[117:16.85]Okay.
[117:26.46]Slow down.
[117:26.82]You're not gonna rush.
[117:31.70]Do I just keep going down this slide and it gets weirder?
[117:37.22]Where are my parents?
[117:44.11]And the holidays, I know, can be rough on a lot of people.
[117:47.49]As much as it's like, oh, Merry Christmas!
[117:49.71]Merry Christmas, everybody!
[117:51.21]Oh, woohoo!
[117:51.99]Woohoo!
[117:52.57]Wine and friends!
[117:55.13]It can be rough, I know.
[117:57.91]So, let's just enjoy ourselves here.
[118:01.22]Right now.
[118:03.50]Together.
[118:12.46]Alright, no more puking.
[118:13.30]Okay, I promise.
[118:17.42]It just ruined a really nice moment.
[118:21.28]I promise I'll never do the I pretend to puke ever again.
[118:26.48]Small town in mourning as mass missing persons case at local park continues to go unsolved.
[118:30.50]Reports say both children and adults missing.
[118:36.89]Detective working on the case sheds light on its peculiarity.
[118:41.35]Here's the notepad.
[118:44.83]It's as if they disappeared into thin air.
[118:47.17]He asks anyone if they've seen any information to come to the station.
[118:52.34]Okay.

[119:13.33]You're a wretch of victims.
[119:17.19]I don't know what you mean by that.
[119:18.55]What do you mean?
[119:22.31]What's that mean?
[119:24.57]Is it a joke?
[119:25.59]Can't tell.
[119:32.55]It's a meme.
[119:33.35]Oh, okay.
[119:34.47]I was like, what are you talking about?
[119:36.73]Go up the slide.
[119:37.63]I already tried to go up the slide.
[119:41.88]In the game.
[119:44.27]I thought that person was, like, talking shit.
[119:45.83]I was like, what the fuck?
[119:52.65]Oh, I thought that person was, like, shit talking.
[119:58.11]He was ready.
[119:58.83]I'm in defense mode.
[120:07.05]What's the wine?
[120:07.71]It's a Cabernet.
[120:08.33]I don't know how to say that word.
[120:10.05]I just pretend to so people think I'm sophisticated.
[120:15.06]Alright, double earbuds, let's do it.
[120:20.47]Yeah, I just pretend to know how to say that word, so when I go to a dinner party, people think I'm intelligent.
[120:50.31]still going I can see my dead pixel and it pisses me off crawl meter hold then release space while moving to crawl what hold then release space to crawl like a little jump
[121:20.77]Colonoscopy.
[121:38.51]Hold down space.
[121:39.51]What?
[121:42.91]What's it want me to do?
[121:59.86]Should I just bunny hop through the whole thing?
[122:00.98]Uh...
[122:30.02]Stairs?
[122:34.29]I saw green.
[122:34.83]I was like, what is that?
[122:41.23]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[122:44.58]Do I have to dodge all this?
[123:08.58]Alright.
[123:13.26]Remove- should I do this?
[123:25.29]I feel like this is a mistake.
[123:31.96]It's like big bag of trash is gonna explode.
[123:40.44]Feed them?
[123:44.31]Feed them.
[124:17.69]I hear shit and- okay.
[124:20.67]Okay, this is like a face.
[124:22.61]What do I- what do I do?
[124:23.73]What do I- I don't get it.
[124:24.51]What do I do?
[124:28.43]What the fuck are you doing over here, man?
[124:31.15]Relax, I'm fine.
[124:34.56]Hey, relax, relax, relax.
[124:35.68]I'm 27- when I started, I was 27 years old.

[124:41.62]Just- don't worry, man, relax.
[124:52.68]I don't get it.
[124:53.22]Do I have to run away?
[125:00.58]Go back up the hole?
[125:01.28]I think I have to go back up this way.
[125:14.42]Alright, feed them.
[125:22.20]Alright, then we go.
[125:22.98]We get out of here.
[125:23.64]We leave.
[125:23.98]We go back up the tunnel.
[125:24.82]Just run.
[125:28.34]There is no run.
[125:29.04]I think I have to go back up.
[125:40.47]Yeah, I just gotta go in.
[125:41.21]Alright, go, go, go, go, go.
[125:42.25]Hurry up.

[128:20.34]Are you people that play that game?
[128:23.94]That was Slide in the Woods.
[128:29.11]Alright, I think it's time to take a break from the crazy shit.
[128:33.57]We're going to play a little chill, fun little game called Freeways.
[128:38.18]Seems kind of fun.
[128:38.64]You have to make traffic patterns.
[128:42.40]By the way, all these are on itch.io.
[128:45.21]Freeways.
[128:45.65]It's kind of cool.
[128:56.32]Where- Freeways, there it is.
[128:57.86]Okay.

[129:10.99]Okay.
[129:11.83]Draw a road from the factory to Highway 6.
[129:18.90]Like that.
[129:20.30]Easy.
[129:23.29]You must connect all the roads to all other roads.
[129:27.79]Alright, so we're going to go like this.
[129:30.39]Like that.
[129:31.77]Click highway signs to see which roads still need to be connected.
[129:37.54]Oh, fuck.
[129:37.94]I'm not going to be able to do this.
[129:50.01]Like that?
[129:52.79]Six needs to go to... Oh.
[129:57.74]Oops.
[130:04.44]This needs to go over here.
[130:05.82]It does.
[130:06.44]This needs to go that way.
[130:07.78]It does.
[130:08.18]Did I do it?
[130:20.58]This bit of a shit face that made this.
[130:21.90]Makes sense.
[130:26.58]Did it work?
[130:26.98]Look at the arrows.
[130:42.65]I got it.
[130:43.07]It works.
[130:53.09]I don't get it.
[130:53.85]Clear.
[130:56.01]Okay.
[130:56.73]Highway 6 needs to connect to 101 and 1- Okay, so here we go.
[131:04.45]This needs to go here and here.
[131:05.97]Okay.
[131:12.58]You can go that way or that way.
[131:14.36]You can also go... ...from here...
[131:23.66]I don't get it.
[131:24.06]Did I do it?
[131:34.69]I don't get it.
[131:39.53]The directional arrows?
[131:44.35]Oh.
[131:44.67]I don't get it.
[131:59.23]Yo!
[132:12.29]By the way, Boba Fett's in Fortnite.
[132:15.93]Wait.
[132:18.17]All right.
[132:28.97]Traffic flow 71.
[132:31.23]Complexity.
[132:31.83]Okay.
[132:34.91]New intersection.
[132:35.61]Let's go.
[132:37.29]What over here?
[132:37.67]Oi.
[132:37.73]Did I win?
[133:23.85]Why are there fucking cars over here, dude?
[133:29.45]The arrow?
[133:30.00]What the hell?
[133:30.64]Drive!
[133:31.10]Let's go!
[133:39.80]Roundabout.
[133:40.24]Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[133:46.87]I don't get it.
[133:47.39]Why is it not working?
[134:04.79]Drive your cars, it's fucking easy!
[134:06.17]It's kind of a mess.
[134:32.11]The direction you draw matters, okay?
[134:34.11]102, that's better than an A+.
[134:35.69]That's an S. What's this?
[134:41.17]Alright.
[134:42.77]So, this is residential.
[134:45.41]So, green road.
[134:46.92]So, this is 17 north.
[134:50.26]This goes down.
[134:51.22]This goes over here.
[134:55.64]This connects here.
[134:58.12]You can go to...
[135:01.29]Green road from here splits.
[135:05.71]You can't go that way.
[135:10.85]That's the wrong way.
[135:27.38]So if this is a highway and this can go through here.
[135:31.26]And this can go through here.
[135:33.86]And then they'll just figure it out.
[135:34.88]Because they're fucking goddamn animals.
[135:36.98]Who cares?
[135:42.52]This is it.
[135:42.82]You put lights here.
[135:43.70]It's easy.
[136:03.76]We're all ants on the highway.
[136:05.12]Who cares?
[136:06.42]We're all animals on the highway.
[136:09.35]From space, when they look down, we're ants.
[136:13.89]We're all bugs.
[136:14.57]We're all animals.
[136:15.33]It doesn't matter.
[136:58.13]Alright, what do I do?
[137:05.93]This is residential.
[137:07.19]You have like one road that comes out.
[137:08.93]One road that goes in.
[137:11.57]Look at that.
[137:15.30]Okay.
[137:16.86]No, idiot.
[137:19.28]Okay, you get on the highway.
[137:27.35]The highway's gonna go like here.
[137:28.69]I don't know, highways do like a weird circle and shit.
[137:32.55]I don't know.
[138:08.65]I'm not a city planner, guys.
[138:10.91]We're all bugs.
[138:11.61]Who cares?
[138:20.37]Use ramps?
[138:27.02]Oh, wait a minute.
[138:40.45]All right.
[138:40.81]So that's above.
[138:41.81]Okay.
[138:43.19]That way.
[138:44.58]This way.
[138:45.82]Yeah.
[139:10.90]I got it.
[139:14.07]What's the problem?
[139:14.67]What's going on?
[139:23.25]What's the problem?
[139:27.90]People can come to and from.
[139:29.82]Wait a minute.
[139:30.12]Hold on.
[139:58.43]This dude's on coke.
[140:03.08]I don't get it.
[140:03.76]I just can't see things mathematically.
[140:06.90]Give me the glasses.
[140:09.12]We're all bugs, goddammit.
[140:10.81]Who cares?
[140:11.21]We're all animals from up above in space.
[140:33.71]You need a ramp.
[140:42.17]Guys, I just drive on the road.
[140:43.41]I don't know how it works.
[140:45.29]I just go like this.
[140:46.15]Whenever I get to the part where you guys are describing, I go like this.
[140:52.34]Big circle, big circle, big circle, big circle, big circle, big circle, big circle, big circle, big circle, big circle, straight line.
[140:58.18]Okay, somebody planned this that's smarter than me.
[141:03.04]Uh, what's the game called?
[141:03.94]Freeways.
[141:05.10]On Itch.io.
[141:07.18]Freeways.
[141:07.84]It's like three bucks.
[141:13.79]I don't get it.
[141:14.63]I'm moving on.
[141:17.23]I don't get it.
[141:23.45]Highways go like... They keep going...

[142:03.86]I- I can't do it.
[142:05.20]I- I don't have a fucking mathematics to reconnect everything.
[142:31.38]Now take your goddamn turns!
[142:41.80]I did it.
[142:46.22]Nope, I'm done.
[142:50.75]Oh shit.
[143:30.19]That was Freeways.
[143:30.89]It was fun.
[143:34.75]If you're smarter than I am, go ahead and play it.
[143:36.55]It's a cool game.
[143:38.31]I'm going to get this one out of the way.
[143:39.65]I'm getting this one out of the way.
[143:40.45]This one's terrifying.
[143:42.95]This one is called Puppet Combo Scary Tales Volume 1.
[143:46.45]I'm not fucking prepared for this shit.
[143:47.93]This one's going to be the worst in the night.
[143:58.43]I'm not looking forward to this.
[143:59.43]It's going to be horrible.
[144:02.15]Lower your volume.
[144:02.99]Okay.
[144:18.17]It's just your tracking.
[144:19.07]All right.
[144:19.72]Lower your volume.
[144:20.88]It's lowered.
[144:21.38]I got it.
[144:38.34]Alright, puppet combo.
[144:39.42]This game is going to be scary, I guess.
[144:45.27]Thanks for joining me on Christmas Eve.
[144:48.03]Uh, what should I do?
[144:50.39]Why is this, like, weird?
[144:56.54]Feed Me Billy, Spiders, Night Shift, or the Riverside Incident.
[145:03.30]Which one?
[145:03.68]Which one are we doing?
[145:09.08]Why does this look like it's fucked up?
[145:14.12]Oh, shit.
[145:14.38]It is fucked up.
[145:14.90]Okay.
[145:15.42]Hold on.
[145:24.43]I gotta run us in a window?
[145:31.83]Why is it doing that?
[145:39.88]I mean, I'm gonna do them all.
[145:42.48]Alright, night shift.
[145:44.00]Night shift.
[145:44.98]Why is it cut off?
[145:46.76]Why is it cut off?
[145:47.26]Okay, night shift.
[145:54.34]Uh, you take a job at a desolate convenience store and get put on graveyard shift.
[145:57.99]As you try to work, you feel somebody's watching from a distance.
[146:05.27]Oh.
[146:07.15]It's loud, I know.
[146:08.09]Turn your speakers down.
[146:11.43]Now playing Night Shift.
[146:17.95]Turn off the VHX effects.
[146:29.34]Okay.
[146:29.78]It opened another game.
[146:30.60]I have a blue screen.
[146:36.52]Uh, what?
[146:45.44]What the fuck is happening right now?
[146:54.68]What the fuck?
[147:07.15]I gotta capture the right window.
[147:10.63]It opened up another game.
[147:15.79]That's weird.
[147:21.18]There we go.
[147:21.58]Okay.
[147:21.98]That was weird.
[147:25.86]What time are you getting out?
[147:28.63]Amber, want me to pick you up?
[147:29.73]Yeah, it's too far to walk.
[147:31.09]No, I'll get a ride.
[147:34.93]Okay.
[147:39.59]The fuck?
[147:40.60]What's happening?
[147:46.24]What the hell?
[147:52.52]Oh.
[147:59.18]Uh, yeah, sure.
[147:59.92]Pick me up.
[148:00.32]Why not?
[148:03.40]As if.
[148:03.70]I'll be conked out by then.
[148:05.41]I'll have a beer for you later.
[148:07.29]Have fun.
[148:14.75]Okay, yeah, that's gotta- God damn it, I've re-req-
[149:01.85]This stupid fucking goddamn light.
[149:03.74]It falls.
[149:04.58]Give me two minutes.
[149:06.67]Ugh.
[150:24.14]You know, a ring light is like $12 on Amazon.
[150:28.92]What am I doing?
[150:31.14]I'm putting up this light teetering on my other monitor.
[150:36.42]What the fuck am I doing?
[150:38.33]Why am I doing it like this?
[150:40.91]Okay, so here's what happened.
[150:41.95]It fell down, knocked the wine glass over, the wine went all over the floor, and all over the table.
[150:46.69]So give me one second.
[150:47.61]I'm still cleaning it up.
[150:49.31]I'll be right back.
[151:49.80]everywhere.
[151:50.40]It, like, exploded.
[151:53.94]The wine glass exploded.
[151:57.06]This wine everywhere.
[151:59.69]Oh, it's just such a disaster.
[152:02.09]I'm alright, though.
[152:02.67]I'm having a good time.
[152:04.67]It's okay.
[152:05.77]You know, you win some, you lose some.
[152:07.57]You don't buy a fucking $12 ring light on Amazon and you fuck your whole room up.
[152:11.42]Alright, sounds good.
[152:12.08]See you in a minute.
[152:35.06]Bye.
[154:43.50]Alright, let's go.
[154:43.96]I'm back.
[154:45.52]Ready to go.
[154:45.88]Yeah, I just have to clean an entire wine spill off of my nice desk and floor in four and a half minutes.
[154:54.74]I fucking knew this was going to happen too.
[154:59.11]This stupid light.
[155:00.19]I swear to God.
[155:01.35]I knew it.
[155:03.65]I was like, you know what?
[155:04.23]That's probably dangerous.
[155:08.51]Ay carumba.
[155:09.81]Of course.
[155:14.88]How you doing?
[155:16.30]Yeah, it's not good.
[155:17.92]It's alright.
[155:21.80]Okay.
[155:24.24]Okay, let's go.
[155:27.83]The thing is, it's so annoying because that wasn't even like a- Oh, he's drunk and he spilled.
[155:31.57]No, no, no.
[155:32.01]It's- Would you like to see where you are?
[155:35.29]Sure.
[155:35.47]You want to see what's right next to you?
[155:42.57]There's a light that's right next to the camera.
[155:45.71]And I moved the desk too much.
[155:48.49]And it just like fucking crashed.
[155:53.75]I think... Oh, yo.
[155:55.84]We're good.
[156:00.36]This is expensive.
[156:01.92]This is like at least a $70 to $80 sweater.
[156:03.02]It's empty now.
[156:11.04]I think I'm good, though.
[156:12.42]I'm gonna have to repaint that wall.
[156:13.68]I'm not kidding.
[156:20.26]That wall has to get repainted.
[156:21.26]$80,000.
[156:24.46]No, I said $70, not $80,000.
[156:25.78]What are you talking about?
[156:29.82]What a fucking disaster.
[156:30.76]Alright, let's go.
[156:36.82]What a waste of wine, too.
[156:37.91]I like this.
[156:38.29]This is a good one.
[156:40.80]Unbelievable.
[156:44.30]I'm not even drunk.
[156:46.74]It just happened.
[156:47.51]It was annoying.
[156:47.97]It's because of the stupid light.
[156:50.23]Remind me before the stream ends.
[156:51.33]I've got to buy a ring light on Amazon for $12.
[156:53.49]Remind me tonight before I leave.
[156:55.11]All right.
[156:56.93]Let's go.
[156:57.87]My hand's so sticky.
[157:00.21]What is this?
[157:01.39]What is this?
[157:01.67]What are you doing here?
[157:02.54]Get out of here.
[157:02.96]Leave me alone.
[157:08.70]All right.
[157:10.78]Controls, WSD is move, Q and E is peak, shift, run, space jump, yeah, yeah, yeah, drop item, inventory, whatever.
[157:16.62]New headphones for this one, what do you think?
[157:39.14]This is gonna freak me out.
[157:39.94]This thing hurts my head.
[157:46.62]Okay.
[157:48.32]There's a run, okay.
[157:49.28]How do I open it?
[157:56.33]Open the fucking door, man!
[158:00.93]Open the door!
[158:01.65]Stay open!
[158:02.09]Why is it- What's going on?
[158:03.07]Destined time.
[158:06.67]Hurry up and punch in.
[158:08.70]I've got a hot date tonight.
[158:10.90]Well, shit.
[158:14.12]Come on, I've got to go.
[158:14.92]Did you sweep the floor at least?
[158:15.98]It's the phone fixed.
[158:19.38]The suit floor?
[158:20.66]Sorry, dude.
[158:21.10]I was too busy.
[158:21.64]Hey, Rick left a list of side work to do on your shift.
[158:24.84]Now I've got to get out of here.
[158:25.80]Yeah, one more thing.
[158:28.08]I can't find the keys anywhere.
[158:29.22]The bathrooms are locked up.
[158:32.30]So go behind the dumpster, I guess.
[158:33.98]I'm going to have a good date.
[158:39.17]If my calculations are correct, I'll be rounding 3rd base in 1 hour and 16 seconds.
[158:43.37]Whatever you say.
[158:48.28]Do I have to go to the dumpster?
[158:55.90]Hello?
[159:15.78]Dumpster.
[159:18.68]Where's the key?
[159:30.02]It's so loud.
[159:32.45]Try better.
[159:39.13]All right.
[159:39.49]Keys in the dumpster.
[159:40.31]Where is it?
[159:40.65]Where is it?
[159:44.50]Cats must be working tonight.
[159:52.92]CRTV off.
[159:57.27]That's what I did.
[160:00.15]It means go behind the dumpster.
[160:08.49]Did I get top left?
[160:15.08]What do you mean?
[160:17.36]CRT.

[162:38.26]Alright, where are we going?
[162:50.34]What do I do?
[162:53.88]If I sell anything, I put the money in here.
[162:58.64]Gas pump?
[163:00.72]I can turn the gas pump on.
[163:02.39]Chips, beer, and oil.
[163:04.55]Okay.
[163:08.15]Can I drink this?
[163:09.85]Donuts.
[163:10.21]There's a list near the register, is there?
[163:27.29]Oh.
[163:28.89]Hey guys, sorry the phone line isn't fixed.
[163:31.91]You'll have to bear with me until the repair guy comes.
[163:35.23]Don't worry, I'm not expecting any emergencies.
[163:38.16]I need you guys to do a little better job on sidewalk during your shift.
[163:45.18]I'm expecting this to be finished when I come by in the afternoon.
[163:49.32]Sweep the floors.
[163:50.81]Place items that weren't purchased.
[163:53.79]Fade where they belong.
[163:55.73]Clean the bathrooms.
[163:56.85]Okay.
[164:01.79]This is a beer.

[238:07.70]Nice pick.
[238:08.02]Alright, coming up next, we have... Okay.
[238:18.79]I don't know if I'm going to be able to do this one with the amount of wine I've consumed over the last few hours.
[238:23.31]I'm going to try nonetheless.
[238:25.22]We're going to play Everwood.
[238:27.26]Everhood.
[238:28.34]Everhood.
[238:31.43]Here comes Everhood, one of the biggest requested games.
[238:37.05]Should I play this with a controller?
[238:48.04]Yes?
[238:49.04]Okay.
[238:51.92]There's wine all over this.
[238:58.46]Plug!
[239:00.30]Where's my plug?
[239:05.65]So, playing this after like five glasses of wine, is this a bad idea?
[239:09.51]We'll find out.
[239:18.76]Uh, flashing lights again, by the way.
[239:23.80]Just be aware of that.
[239:26.26]Everhood.
[239:28.28]Drunk Wine Mom.
[239:32.07]I think I'm gonna be pretty good at this, I think.
[239:33.73]I think I'm gonna do pretty well.
[239:37.74]An inferable tale of the inexpressible divine moments of truth.
[239:41.77]Let's go.
[239:42.05]All right.
[239:49.05]Settings.
[239:49.39]Yeah, whatever.
[239:53.96]Yeah, whatever.

[240:07.90]Heart?
[240:09.48]Expert?

[240:16.66]Heart, heart, heart.
[240:22.93]Go.
[240:37.86]Hello.
[240:45.29]We are delighted to see you.
[240:46.61]To enter this realm, you must leave your humanity.
[240:53.83]Abandon your idea of time and accept immortality.
[240:57.84]You can leave and return as you will, compared to your current life where there is only one way out.
[241:02.92]You agree?
[241:04.20]Abandon humanity, time, and accept immortality?
[241:08.97]I don't want to be I would I would want to live like 400 years tops total Excellent Like the human world we have blurred the lines of purpose, but the road is clear.
[241:21.46]It's after all for your amusement I Think like three or four hundred years is enough to you like you can see everything I Would live in every country for like five years
[241:39.09]After that, it's like, dude, I don't want to do it anymore.
[241:42.25]Let's go.
[241:50.21]What would you do for 400 years?
[241:54.11]I'd be able to fucking raise my great, great, great, great, great grandkids.
[241:58.19]That's kind of cool.
[242:16.81]Someone said this game is hard.
[242:19.82]I'm a rhythm game Andy though.
[242:21.16]I'm a rhythm game Andy.
[242:23.26]I think I can handle it.
[242:30.04]If there's one thing I can do on this stream, it's play rhythm games.
[242:34.55]Trust me.
[242:37.15]I should be fine.
[242:41.09]Seems like the wooden doll has started walking.
[242:43.04]Didn't think you'd wake up.
[242:46.50]Hmm.
[242:47.42]You're missing an arm.
[242:50.34]Can you do it?
[243:01.51]Jump.
[243:03.80]Move.
[243:04.38]If I can hit one time, I'm going to give 100 community subs.
[243:16.39]All right, fine.
[243:47.54]Is it the beat?
[243:48.70]To the beat?
[243:49.72]Or am I jumping over the... Is it the beat?
[243:54.79]Like, to the beat?
[244:13.75]Thank you.
[245:34.97]I get it.
[245:36.25]I get it.
[245:43.89]I actually don't.
[245:49.95]So it's not to the beat.
[245:53.01]Stop moving in random directions.
[246:02.06]Okay.
[246:03.94]This is a save point.
[246:04.66]All right.
[246:06.28]Delayed to the melody.
[246:07.96]Right.
[246:13.76]The higher the pitch, the further to the right the bar is going to be.
[246:17.67]Oh, okay.
[246:19.01]That's kind of cool.
[246:22.69]It's fucked up.
[246:33.38]2,400 subs?
[246:34.32]Wait, what?
[246:38.00]What are you talking about?
[246:38.84]Right now?
[246:41.11]No.
[246:41.45]You just freaked me the fuck out.
[246:43.95]Holy shit, man.
[246:44.75]I was like, who is giving that much money?
[246:47.29]What are you doing?
[246:59.37]You owe us 20... Wait, what?
[247:02.79]I said 100, not 2400.
[247:03.35]I didn't.
[247:04.09]I said 100, not 2400.
[247:05.05]You must have schmuckles to enter.
[247:10.35]20 schmuckles to get to the ATM machine.
[247:11.51]Okay.
[247:32.05]I give 100.
[247:32.27]Yeah, I will.
[247:39.23]I must insert my soul.
[247:40.34]I said if I got hit, I would give 100.
[247:47.05]That was not every single time I got hit.
[248:31.68]Quiet!
[248:43.67]I got it, everybody relax.
[248:50.34]One, two, one, two, go.
[249:40.64]This guy sucks.
[249:50.48]Shut up.

[250:52.79]Thanks for the help.
[250:56.86]Give the subs.
[250:57.94]At the end of this, I'll give them in a minute.
[251:00.26]Give me a minute.
[251:00.80]Give me two minutes.
[251:04.34]Do mouse and keyboard.
[251:05.56]Really?
[251:05.82]You think so?
[251:21.94]Don't?
[251:23.04]Okay.
[251:24.60]I do not have a VIP card.
[251:26.06]No, I do not.
[251:29.32]Very cool.
[251:31.72]I'm not really a great dancer, but I like seeing people enjoy themselves.
[251:34.26]Someday I might try dancing.
[251:35.42]Alright, well, good luck.
[251:38.40]Hey, that doll face.
[251:39.32]How'd you lose your arm?
[251:40.30]My condolences.
[251:43.11]Okay.
[251:45.27]Sure, I'll have a drink.
[252:04.51]I love dancing.
[252:05.46]The best thing I know how to do.
[252:07.58]But I do like drinking blood too.
[252:09.30]I'm getting kind of thirsty.
[252:10.64]Okay.
[252:17.10]We mushroom people usually play in the woods.
[252:19.35]You should come visit someday.
[252:21.71]We love to play hide and seek, but nobody wants to be the seeker.
[252:24.37]Maybe someday.
[252:27.17]Okay.
[252:29.53]Ooh.
[252:30.09]Sorry.
[252:30.87]Ludwig.

[252:51.94]Oh, my God.
[252:52.32]Ludwig.
[252:52.88]I love Ludwig.
[252:55.13]You desecrated 2,000 schmuck drink.
[252:58.33]That's not what he said.
[252:58.97]I am a VIP, and hoodlums like you are not going to get away with it.

[255:45.38]There's a lot of people here right now.
[255:46.58]What happened?
[255:49.93]Connor raided?
[255:50.43]I got raided?
[255:52.23]I had to have.
[255:53.81]We went up like 3-4,000 people.
[255:55.81]Connor eats pants!
[255:56.73]What's going on, dude?
[255:58.11]Thanks for the raid.

[256:14.39]Nah, not yet.
[256:15.79]Maybe a little.
[256:17.67]Uh, alright, let's go.
[256:18.27]I don't know, my light just turned off, but that's weird.
[256:21.49]Hold on, let me fix this.
[256:24.81]Let me fix it.
[256:25.97]Give me a second.
[256:26.98]BRB, two seconds.

[256:40.70]And would you believe it?
[256:44.08]Got light again.
[256:47.75]Got light again.
[256:49.45]No, thanks for the raid.
[256:50.81]Merry Christmas to you, Connor.
[256:54.21]Really looking forward to when we play Super Smash Brothers Brawl next week.
[257:01.10]That's not happening.

[259:49.05]I'm so burnt out.
[259:49.85]Ooh, got the VIP ticket.
[259:56.80]I'll take it.
[260:04.76]It's Undertale?
[260:06.48]Please take this.
[260:18.91]So I have a VIP ticket now.
[260:20.37]Where do I do that?

[260:40.13]Nice!
[260:40.77]Save your progress here, let's go.
[260:45.59]Why would I ever play Super Smash Bros.
[260:47.13]Brawl?
[260:47.41]It's literally the fucking worst game I've ever made.
[260:50.57]That's underneath E.T.
[260:55.72]Nice reference.
[260:56.30]Yeah, not bad.
[261:02.40]Ooh.

[262:37.42]Merry Christmas fuckheads.
[262:39.94]Just copying somebody from chat.
[262:52.63]Alright, I'm pretty much, I think I'm at the end of the game, so I'm good to go.
[262:55.27]We're at the end of the game.
[263:05.32]Ooh, boss fight, let's go.
[263:10.74]Who let you in here?
[263:13.08]It's the doll I stole from the arm.
[263:15.76]Well, well, well, did you come here with your arm back?
[263:19.30]WTF?
[263:19.42]What the heck?
[263:20.12]That was Pac-Man.
[263:20.96]Holy crap.
[263:58.92]All right, if I get hit in the next 10 seconds, I will give... Not much.
[264:20.77]Jesus Christ, dude.
[264:27.38]Alright, alright.
[264:28.18]Run it back.
[264:28.78]Run it back.

[264:34.34]Was I supposed to lose?
[264:38.33]Oh, you married into it.
[264:39.17]You married into it.
[264:57.96]What's going on?
[265:03.96]This game's actually really cool.
[265:05.60]I like it.
[265:07.81]Stop making references that 10 people max will understand.
[265:12.17]I feel like that's 60% of every stream.
[265:21.73]You're talking about most of the things I say.
[265:31.39]What the fuck?
[265:32.27]Alright, headphones going in, volume going up, let's go, bro.
[266:00.15]What am I supposed to do about this?
[266:14.71]Here we go!
[266:19.39]I'm doing it to the beat of the song and it's just fucking me over.
[266:57.56]Hey!
[267:43.10]This is fucking tight.
[267:44.12]This song is sick.
[268:02.49]Woo!

[268:14.18]Oh, yeah, it's 12 o'clock Eastern.
[268:15.62]You're right.
[268:17.05]Merry Christmas to all our Eastern Time friends.
[268:20.77]Merry Christmas.
[268:21.25]Come on.
[268:52.33]This game's good.

[269:28.80]Damn!
[269:29.44]Jesus!
[270:11.28]So many colors!
[270:57.52]Leave me alone, leave me alone.
[271:22.52]Oh, we're going upside down.
[271:23.46]Oh my god.
[271:26.57]Dude, what the fuck are you doing to me?
[272:03.99]Dude, you gotta don't do that shit to me right now, I can't see anything!
[272:26.06]Jesus, I have.. You don't drink a whole bottle of wine and play this game like this right now, are you kidding me?
[272:54.00]When does it end?
[272:54.82]I feel like I've been here for like three years.
[272:56.85]How long have I been here for?
[272:58.25]It's backwards!
[273:13.78]The game is backwards right now.
[273:15.28]Left is right, right is left.
[273:17.20]You shitting me, dude.
[273:18.64]Don't even...

[273:35.23]You're not supposed to be here.
[273:37.45]It seems you've returned early.
[273:38.69]This shouldn't be possible.
[273:42.97]Something is amiss.
[273:44.53]I cannot allow you to learn too much.
[273:45.97]It would interfere with your purpose.
[273:51.37]I will restore your body to before you started to drift away.
[273:56.94]Okay, do what you were doing, but be careful.
[274:00.37]That was awesome.

[274:05.31]Wow.
[274:08.29]Okay.
[274:10.55]If you want, I can give you an absolute truth.
[274:13.56]This is certainly not the right way to do it.
[274:18.14]But it might help you.
[274:19.92]Or it might twist you.
[274:20.72]Do you want to hear the truth?
[274:23.02]Yeah.
[274:23.82]Tell me.
[274:29.18]nothing is lost once life is death there will be a part of transfer you cannot be a part of the departed oh the departed uh up oh don't watch the movie I just saved you three hours okay our choices will be justified in the end there'll be a reconciliation no matter how ugly

[274:56.56]Okay.
[274:57.90]Now you must continue.

[275:10.44]Is Wine Mom drunk yet?
[275:11.96]This is empty.
[275:18.07]Well, no.
[275:19.15]No, this does more.
[275:22.83]It's Christmas Eve, man.
[275:26.84]Sending out my signals to all of you.
[275:28.90]I hope you have a good Christmas.
[275:33.06]Enjoy yourselves.
[275:33.70]Have a good... Hopefully you got something for your friends and family.
[275:36.08]Hopefully your friends and family maybe thought of you.
[275:38.67]Even if it's just a card.
[275:39.55]Doesn't have to be material bullshit.
[275:45.67]Don't worry about that nonsense.
[275:50.41]Oh, hey.
[275:52.19]So, uh, gold pig stole my legs.
[275:54.69]Yeah, they're detachable just like your limbs.
[275:58.60]I can't believe you survived the incinerator.
[276:02.03]No one survives.
[276:03.61]Please take this video.
[276:05.69]Okay.
[276:07.81]Okay.
[276:12.54]Yeah, let's go.
[276:15.42]Get up.
[276:16.98]Get up!
[276:18.36]All right.
[276:22.06]Hey, I'm just a door.
[276:22.88]I don't have a lot of responsibilities besides standing here.
[276:25.56]You really want to go after a big guy like that?
[276:28.23]I was impressed that they even got through me.
[276:32.27]Of course, uh, gold pig is magic to make it easier.
[276:35.85]Okay.
[276:36.97]Okay.
[276:39.67]Okay.
[276:42.01]Okay.
[276:44.60]You did survive the incinerator somehow.
[276:47.26]No one else has done that.
[276:48.32]Okay.
[276:49.84]The corpse is around.
[276:50.62]You prov- Ah, okay.
[276:52.95]Okay.
[276:54.05]Okay.
[276:55.19]Okay.
[276:59.72]This really does remind me of Undertale.
[277:05.06]Where am I going?
[277:05.72]Let's give it to the creeps.
[277:11.20]I know it's empty, but someone fizzled.
[277:12.80]Please let us leave red.
[277:14.18]No, I'm doing a fucking song, man.
[277:19.10]I want to leave this place someday.
[277:20.37]Maybe one day.
[277:26.09]Good luck.
[277:41.80]I was not prepared for that.
[277:45.88]Save, save, save, save, save, save.
[277:47.98]I don't know what I didn't save.
[277:48.96]I'll get a first try, guaranteed.
[278:02.76]Where do I go?
[278:09.58]Overconfidence.
[278:10.38]Yeah.
[278:10.58]No, you're right.
[278:12.83]You're right.
[278:13.17]You're right.
[278:13.45]You're right.
[278:14.89]That's smart.
[278:21.65]Okay.
[278:26.69]How do I get out of here?
[278:39.28]What'd I do?
[278:42.96]Oh, shoot.
[278:47.32]Stop right there, Red Hood!
[278:50.32]I've been sent by the Gold Pig to stop you from reaching the cursed castle.
[278:54.64]Stop your quest at once, go back to where you came from, and I won't hurt you.
[279:03.88]Go.
[279:07.54]You called my bluff, huh?
[279:12.35]There's no po- I won't bother you with- I know I won't beat you anyway.
[279:20.19]I won't fuck off.
[279:22.63]In a nice way.
[279:24.18]In a nice way.
[279:39.34]Fuck off respectfully.
[279:51.18]Go.
[279:54.70]Oh.
[279:56.58]Oh, I have to move the train.
[280:23.43]I love this game.

[280:53.72]We got it right now.
[281:08.03]You idiot.
[281:46.85]My nose is itchy and I can't do anything about it.
[281:49.07]Oh my god, what do I do?
[281:54.53]I feel weird.
[281:57.61]That was weird.
[281:58.45]That was weird.
[282:22.92]I got cut off.
[282:23.49]What was that BS?
[282:29.47]I can feel you running through my veins.
[282:36.21]Oh, it's a fight you want.
[282:37.12]Okay.
[282:40.16]Oh, it's you again.
[282:40.94]What the hell do you want?
[282:43.54]I'll be annoying somewhere else.
[282:44.84]I'm busy.
[282:45.16]Can't you tell?
[282:54.80]This game's addicting.
[282:55.52]It actually is really.
[282:56.49]I gotta move on.
[283:00.57]I'm kind of addicted to the game.
[283:03.83]I gotta play more stuff.

[297:44.23]I don't think I can.
[297:44.93]I can't do that right now.
[297:58.48]Is that going to be Yakuza, or will you revisit that game?
[298:03.16]I thought that was awesome.
[298:06.20]But I do want to play Art School before this stream turns off.
[298:18.04]This game looks really fun.
[298:25.33]What about Saints Row 2?
[298:26.55]Eh, probably not.
[298:32.34]Please keep at it.
[298:33.06]That anime level, you were almost at the end.
[298:35.04]No, the stream's not over.
[298:39.18]No.
[298:39.58]What?
[298:42.72]I have at least another 45 minutes to an hour to play.
[298:44.93]At least.
[298:47.55]Alright, let's go.
[298:57.68]Move this.
[299:01.41]I gotta clean my desk too.
[299:02.69]Oh my god, what a disaster.
[299:06.12]Yeah, Merry Christmas, East Coast.
[299:13.70]What was that?
[299:14.12]That game was called Everhood.
[299:16.76]E-V-E-R Everhood.
[299:23.92]It was great.
[299:27.60]Okay, time for Chewing Andy.
[299:29.16]Let's get back over here.
[299:32.53]Let's open art school.
[299:37.00]This is like a classic itch.io game.
[299:39.24]From my understanding, let me get this thing bright.
[299:44.92]Looks good.
[299:50.65]Alright, art school.
[300:02.05]New game.
[300:06.36]Loading, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[300:09.84]Oh, Froshman.
[300:10.56]I just spit.
[300:12.14]I hope it didn't come up on the camera.
[300:15.93]Welcome to art school.
[300:16.73]Okay.
[300:19.33]Okay.
[300:24.78]You have played Neverhood?
[300:25.44]Neverhood's one of my favorite games I've ever made.
[300:32.45]Analyze your work against my database and give you constructive feedback.
[300:36.87]I was made by scientists, so I'm really good at this.
[300:39.81]Don't worry, it sounds technical, but art school is really simple once you get the hang of it.
[300:45.89]Use your drawing pad to complete the assignments that I give you.
[300:48.95]Okay, get inspired.
[300:52.21]Sick.
[300:53.99]Okay.
[300:55.17]Loading assignment.
[300:59.36]Think of a number between 1 and 50.
[301:01.06]Draw that many birds.
[301:06.91]When you have completed the assignment, return to my office for a critique.
[301:09.49]I was going to do 1.
[301:11.77]Why would I do 50?
[301:23.18]No, 1.
[301:25.80]For Gex?
[301:26.48]What?
[301:40.62]Okay.
[301:43.34]Art school.
[301:43.82]I think we're going to do 1 in 50.
[301:49.51]Draw that many birds.
[301:52.89]I'll do 1.
[302:10.22]This sounds... I did it!
[302:33.21]Where's my prize?
[302:41.89]Where's my prize?
[302:42.63]What?
[302:42.85]I can move?
[302:48.55]I got a color swatch?
[302:52.07]What?
[302:54.51]Oh, goddammit.
[302:55.31]Okay.
[303:05.72]Yeah, I'm hydrating.
[303:06.98]I just drank a bunch of water, so don't worry.
[303:08.54]I'm good.
[303:28.15]What?
[303:38.16]They're like- Alright, how do I- Turn it in?
[303:51.56]How do I turn this in?
[303:59.16]Whoa!
[304:00.60]Oh, okay, I'm here.
[304:04.28]Alright, look what I got to see.
[304:08.36]I got brushes, swatches, let's go.
[304:11.24]What did you dream about last night, two nights ago?
[304:16.71]Um.
[304:23.31]Last night.
[304:32.92]I don't think I had a dream last night.
[304:34.16]What was my last dream?
[304:43.88]What about the night before that?
[304:44.94]Um, I don't know.
[304:48.46]The last dream I remember.
[304:53.97]Just drinking Gatorade out of somebody else's fridge.
[304:59.81]And it was like all the Gatorades were mixed together.
[305:02.03]It was weird.
[305:10.08]It was like all yellow, purple, green, and red Gatorade were all mixed together.
[305:15.26]Like they got the Gatorades down to like here.
[305:18.06]And they poured the last third of it into the same Gatorade.
[305:21.98]And they did that.
[305:23.79]They did that with like six of them.
[305:25.89]So they didn't want to drink the last like gross part of the Gatorade.
[305:28.95]So they combined them all and put them back in the fridge.
[305:32.47]And I drank it.
[305:50.03]okay all right I got it so I didn't wait I'm gonna try to explore what's down here we're dead
[306:14.19]Okay.
[306:22.39]Now what?
[306:27.27]Draw ingredients.
[306:28.37]Okay.
[306:30.15]I need more colors.
[306:43.30]This has been open the whole time.
[306:58.81]Why didn't anybody tell me that?
[306:59.63]It was open the whole time.
[307:03.85]The entire fucking time.
[307:17.22]Where did the game go?
[307:19.62]Dude, what the fuck?
[307:26.38]What are you doing, OBS?
[307:28.54]What are you drinking?
[307:29.44]Crack beer?
[307:40.58]It won't fucking close!
[307:43.22]It won't close!
[307:44.11]I just closed it!
[307:50.05]I get it.
[307:50.39]Oh my god.
[307:51.96]There's an explanation for it.
[308:08.25]Get the fucking spider game out of my goddamn inventory.
[308:11.93]Get out of here.
[308:13.65]Oh my god, why?
[308:15.87]Why?
[308:24.04]Here's what happened.
[308:25.54]I accidentally pinned the Spider.exe file to the taskbar.
[308:32.26]And I kept thinking it was open, so I kept right-clicking it to close it, but I kept opening new instances of the exe.
[308:43.30]So let's unpin that from the taskbar, and keep going.
[308:51.16]Jesus Christ.
[309:00.82]Uh, okay.
[309:01.82]Draw ingredients.
[309:09.23]I need more brushes or something, right?
[309:10.67]Can I go in here?
[309:13.43]Alright, draw.
[309:16.27]Okay, uh, ketchup.
[309:19.67]Mustard.
[309:22.92]Mayonnaise.
[309:25.12]Hot sauce.
[309:40.31]Alright, got it.
[309:47.78]What?
[309:48.90]Those aren't ingredients?
[309:49.86]Yes, they are.
[309:50.44]What?
[309:50.94]How are they not ingredients?
[309:59.60]I need to get back up.
[310:16.57]Alright, you're right.
[310:17.15]Those are condiments.
[310:20.97]Invent a new country, design a flag for it.
[310:22.85]Sure thing.
[310:25.69]You're a malignant nation.
[310:32.15]I need more paints.
[310:37.26]There are spiders in your router.
[310:42.90]F?
[310:43.84]What?
[310:47.18]Are we okay?
[310:48.74]Stream crashed?
[310:50.70]Are we okay?
[310:51.84]Are we here?
[310:52.18]What happened?
[310:56.19]What's going on?
[310:57.43]Are we all right?
[311:02.24]What happened?
[311:09.28]I lagged?
[311:09.70]Oh.
[311:11.34]Well, I don't know.
[311:11.78]That's weird.
[311:17.10]I need more condiments.
[311:18.54]I need more paints.
[311:22.90]The stream crashed.
[311:23.78]That doesn't... I didn't... Really?
[311:27.06]Weird.
[311:38.40]I actually need more colors than blue and black.
[311:45.02]I need to make the German NFI flag, which is pink, green, blue, and like hints of magenta.
[311:54.26]Back to normal?
[311:54.80]That's weird.
[311:55.20]I'm sorry about that.
[311:59.79]You get points for exploring.
[312:01.03]Okay.
[312:08.64]No, this is not cooking wine.
[312:17.01]Where is any new stuff?
[312:21.01]Oh fuck you.
[312:32.50]How did that get the best rating out of everything?
[312:39.38]Draw what's happening in the outside world, okay?
[312:44.56]No.

[312:55.14]I need... Where do I get stuff?
[313:02.05]I didn't... What the fuck?
[313:03.33]I went in somebody's house!
[313:07.44]I went in some- I didn't go back.
[313:09.22]I went in somebody's house.

[313:16.96]Ooh.
[313:22.74]I got text tool.
[313:37.47]How do I move it?
[313:43.16]I want to move that.
[313:53.70]How do I move again?
[313:58.35]Bring the spiders back.
[314:02.23]Yeah, way too many.
[314:02.81]How do I erase?
[314:11.02]Okay.
[314:22.49]I gotta at least communicate with the teacher.
[314:24.45]Again?
[314:24.85]What's going on?
[314:29.55]Why am I dropping frames?
[314:30.35]What?
[314:30.67]What's going on here?
[314:31.19]What the fuck?
[314:34.79]I shouldn't be dropping frames.
[314:35.93]What's going on?
[314:37.37]Was this like two years ago?
[314:40.24]It's Twitch.
[314:42.10]Oh, uh-oh.
[314:43.90]It's a Twitch problem?
[314:46.05]Uh-oh.
[314:48.41]Uh-oh.
[314:58.23]Apparently, it's a Twitch problem, I guess.
[314:59.83]Well.
[315:05.52]Merry Christmas.
[315:06.02]Yeah, Merry Christmas to all of you.
[315:09.74]This drawing is going to end up in a big gold frame.
[315:11.92]Does that change how you approach it?
[315:18.08]Maybe a little.
[315:20.88]So apparently it's a Twitch problem, I guess.
[315:23.77]I have no idea.
[315:28.51]I guess Twitch is having problems?
[315:31.47]It's not a Twitch problem, it's a spider problem.
[315:51.23]The real question is, is he gonna draw boogers down both the nostrils?
[315:54.29]Of course he is.
[315:56.41]He's in the fucking first grade.
[316:08.34]Where do I go?
[316:23.07]Oh!
[316:24.11]New brush.
[316:25.47]Let's get it.
[316:30.37]White?
[316:30.89]Come on.
[316:34.23]What's that over there?
[316:46.93]Fly!
[316:54.96]Can you do your best Tim Allen grunt?
[317:01.28]Fucking idiot.
[317:04.27]Tested myself for that one.
[317:05.41]I really am.
[317:08.57]Not happy about it.
[317:15.89]Not happy about it at all.
[317:18.03]Very mad.
[317:18.51]Alright, what was the point of coming to this little island?
[317:29.35]Oh, basketball.
[317:37.65]This game's cute.
[317:40.67]Stop minus twoing.
[317:42.84]It's been five and a half hours of quality fucking funny content.
[317:47.32]And just because I said one bad joke doesn't mean the whole stream is bad.
[317:51.18]Scoff.
[317:52.56]Scoff.
[317:53.80]Eye roll.
[317:54.48]Scoff.
[318:00.91]Can I turn this in so it gets off the screen?
[318:06.40]Alright, get me out of here.
[318:12.40]That was five and a half hours of, uh, e-clown cringe.
[318:16.86]That's your opinion.
[318:17.50]It's bad.
[318:19.10]Oh, I failed this one.
[318:26.65]I want you to do this drawing that's going to end with a big gold frame.
[319:10.58]I short for your underwear
[319:49.43]Alright, passed.
[319:52.40]I was going to draw the Mona Lisa, but I was like, that's not going to happen.
[319:54.82]Not going to happen at all.
[319:59.84]Draw as much as the universe.
[320:01.37]I'm not doing this anymore.
[320:02.21]This game's cool.
[320:02.93]This game's cute.
[320:19.52]These are galaxies, if you're curious.
[320:38.95]Alright.
[320:41.53]Alright, next game.
[320:42.91]This one.
[320:59.62]Approach.
[321:00.16]I gotta pee.
[321:00.78]Alright.
[321:11.98]So my portfolio, I just clicked it, and it's just like fucking, they just give me the images, they're just here.
[321:18.08]It's literally like the shit I just drew.
[321:20.90]It just opens up a file that has all the things I just drew.
[321:27.72]In like a Windows Explorer menu.
[321:41.82]Alright, maybe like one or two more.
[321:44.10]Then I'm gonna keep going.
[321:46.40]Hmm.
[321:52.30]Alright, here's your chance.
[321:53.24]Here's your choice.
[321:57.87]Like, 8-bit horror.
[321:58.99]Like, 1632-bit horror.
[321:59.67]Or...
[322:20.29]8-bit?
[322:22.47]Alright, we're gonna play Faith.
[322:25.01]Faith is like a old, old kind of style.
[322:28.39]We're gonna play Faith.
[322:29.99]We'll try it.
[322:30.83]For like a half hour or so.
[322:34.03]Alright guys, let's do it.
[322:36.28]I've had a lot of fun.
[322:36.88]Hopefully you guys have too.
[322:38.92]Let's keep going.
[322:39.74]Sorry the stream shut off a few times.
[322:41.52]It's weird.
[322:43.58]It's very odd.
[322:49.07]That's very stretched.
[322:49.93]It shouldn't be.
[322:53.05]Faith is great.
[322:53.75]Okay.
[322:58.62]Can I make this window bigger?
[323:02.62]20 community subs.

[324:19.47]Like Oregon Trail.

[325:59.19]I think I just got lost.
[326:03.93]I think I'm lost, actually.
[326:07.03]I probably shouldn't have... Oh, wait, what's this?

[332:40.52]You have rich... Rich streamer has gigabit connection?
[332:44.97]Do you have any idea how long it took me to get this connection?
[332:48.97]I suffered.
[332:51.21]Those of the old viewers of this channel, holy smokes, do you remember being on that old Comcast, old Cock Connect?
[332:58.79]We would lose... That's back when I was streaming like three or four times a week at least.
[333:06.50]We would drop 20,000 frames a day.
[333:10.94]This connection has been perfect.
[333:13.38]Without a single issue, which is awesome.
[333:23.82]What's the provider?
[333:25.82]Oh.
[333:27.88]Whiskey.
[333:36.68]Okay.

[334:31.64]That's the house key.
[334:49.33]Up, left, and then I think left one more time.
[335:02.46]Why was this Itch.io when most of these games are on Steam?
[335:07.04]You distracted me!
[335:08.24]Now we have to do the whole thing again!
[335:09.52]Um, no, most of these aren't on Steam.
[335:16.44]What are you talking about?
[335:19.99]I got all these on Itch.io.
[335:20.95]Only, like, a few of them were on Steam.
[335:33.45]I got all these on itch.io because I heard that itch.io gives a higher cut to people, right?
[335:38.43]Than Steam does.
[335:40.15]From my understanding.
[335:43.97]Itch.io's DRM-free.
[335:46.03]Alright, I got the key.
[335:52.07]Alright, boys and girls, let's go.
[336:03.27]Amy was in the very back of the attic in a chair, perfectly calm, staring at us.
[336:07.03]Okay, in the attic.
[336:13.57]Okay.
[336:16.57]That's a huge bed.
[336:18.21]That's a bed for like eight people.
[336:19.75]Can I open stuff?
[336:32.12]Is it an orgy bed?
[336:36.02]I don't know why I read that.
[336:42.56]That would be such a pain in the ass.
[336:45.96]No, I'm not into that.
[336:47.62]No, thank you.
[336:50.70]Yeah, I was just sitting there.
[336:52.34]Just like, what the fuck am I doing here?
[336:53.88]This sucks.
[336:57.11]What if you're the odd man out of the orgy?
[336:59.49]Right?
[336:59.67]Do you have to have an even number?
[337:01.41]What if you have an odd number?
[337:04.45]Is somebody just kind of like...
[337:08.50]Okay, yeah, it looks good.
[337:10.06]Um, anybody?

[337:14.70]What?
[337:14.82]You have to have an even number of people.
[337:18.22]How would you do an odd-numbered orgy?
[337:30.77]What do you mean, what?
[337:31.53]Wait.
[337:46.72]No, fuck that.
[337:47.90]Fuck that.

[337:52.09]No.
[337:53.19]I'm sorry.
[337:54.03]No.
[337:56.79]I didn't read that.
[337:57.67]Mm-mm.
[338:01.92]Don't think so.
[338:20.76]I'm not saying anything.
[338:23.28]I'm going to get myself in trouble if I'm not careful here.
[338:26.34]It's Christmas Eve, god darn it.
[338:27.70]Okay, I'm not going to get myself in trouble on Christmas Eve.
[338:31.82]I'm not going to say anything on Christmas.
[338:33.16]No way.
[338:43.91]I'm just saying.
[338:49.59]You brought it up.
[338:50.31]You did!
[338:50.99]You said, what's with the orgy, bro?
[338:52.39]And I was like, I don't know, man.
[338:53.53]I don't know what you're talking about.
[338:57.41]Alright, we got a picture.
[338:58.29]Okay.
[339:00.23]Father.
[339:01.03]Mother.
[339:01.71]Child.
[339:04.66]I didn't bring this up.
[339:05.84]I did not.
[339:09.18]Somebody said the word orgy and I read it.
[339:10.84]I did not bring it up.
[339:13.16]I did not.
[340:27.33]You know how long I was holding that for?
[340:28.95]Oh, my face hurts.
[340:36.20]I was sitting there for like at least two straight minutes, waiting for the stream to reconnect.
[340:46.72]What the fuck?
[340:47.76]All right, I guess I'm just gonna, I guess I'm just gonna go.
[341:33.84]Wait, are we live?
[341:39.71]I thought I was disconnected.
[341:40.55]I was waiting for it to... Goodbye!
[341:52.83]It's been swell.
[341:53.85]Good to see you again.
[341:54.73]Merry Christmas, everybody.
[341:55.75]I'll see you later.
[341:56.35]Have a great day.
[342:02.28]Am I gone again?
[342:03.66]Wait, wait, wait.
[342:06.16]If I come back.
[342:06.76]Hold on.
[342:07.06]It's important.
[342:22.75]You're on the air?
[342:25.77]Well, what the f- I thought I was going to catch people when they came back.
[342:29.33]You're live.
[342:40.47]Finish the game?
[342:41.59]My stream keeps turning off.
[342:43.57]I'm trying.
[342:47.63]Alright, I'm just gonna go.
[342:49.93]I don't know what's going on.
[342:50.68]Twitch's servers are fucked up, I guess.
[342:53.08]Green teeth?
[342:53.90]No, they're white as snow like Christmas.
[342:57.10]Ding!
[342:58.90]Bye.
[342:59.56]That's it.
[343:00.34]See you later.

[343:08.00]Thanks for coming out.
[343:09.20]Appreciate it.
[343:10.26]Merry Christmas, everybody.
[343:13.34]I mean, I can't... I don't think I can do this shit.
[343:14.89]I keep losing connection every, like, 15 seconds.
[343:20.27]Good night.
[343:22.25]See you, 13-year-old mustache.
[343:28.17]You're in trouble.

[343:37.11]Good night.
[343:38.82]Have a great Christmas.
[343:45.34]I'll see you all on New Year's Eve.
[343:51.38]I think my mic is gone.
[343:52.82]That stream's over anyways.
[343:53.94]I don't think they can even hear me.
[343:57.76]God, I fucking hate streaming.
[344:02.12]I quit.
[344:02.70]I quit.
[344:03.38]I quit.
[344:03.70]I quit.
[344:04.00]I wish I could say that to them live.
[344:07.59]I wish I could fucking say that to them.
[344:11.00]How can I tell them?
[344:11.78]Like, God, I fucking quit.
[344:13.14]Like, I fucking hate streaming.
[344:24.11]Alright, goodbye.

[344:36.38]New Year's Eve.
[344:37.08]No, I'll see you on the 27th.
[344:39.56]That's got me all fucked up.
[344:40.50]I don't know what's going on.
[344:41.66]Good night.
