[02:29.73]How's it going?
[02:31.51]What's up?
[02:35.21]Welcome to another edition of.
[02:39.89]Hanging out and playing video games with.
[02:43.73]A large group of people watching it.
[02:45.35]I got an idea for a game called the candle.
[02:53.05]What do you think I got an idea for a game called the candle?
[02:59.72]Gonna be huge.
[03:07.54]I'm doing alright.
[03:09.81]Got my magical drink.
[03:10.79]It's just a Gatorade, not anything special.
[03:17.59]You only gonna be for one day?
[03:18.65]Yeah, this is one day only.
[03:20.03]For those that are just kind of trickling in.
[03:28.65]It's your birthday today?
[03:32.27]Well, happy birthday.
[03:33.41]What the heck?
[03:40.70]I love how Gatorade says it.
[03:42.18]Gatorade doesn't say on the side of a Gatorade.
[03:45.48]It says Gatorade thirst quencher.
[03:50.22]It doesn't say drink.
[03:53.16]Gatorade thirst quencher.
[04:01.43]That kind of, that makes it sound like I'm getting, I feel way better after taking the sip.
[04:18.50]Get quenched.
[04:23.26]Just red fruit punch, easy.
[04:25.99]The easiest one for me at least.
[04:29.96]I like red.
[04:30.62]I like orange.
[04:33.19]I don't like blue anymore.
[04:35.07]I don't like blue anymore.
[04:38.17]I feel, honestly, I feel like blue is just too much coloring in it.
[04:43.35]That's what I think now.
[04:46.36]I used to love purple Powerade, but it kind of is like they put like a, how many drops of food coloring went into this?
[04:51.82]That's what I think now.
[04:59.69]You could probably say that about red.
[05:02.38]But the thing about red... I don't know if this is crushed up bugs or not.
[05:08.00]It might be.
[05:08.60]I don't know.
[05:08.94]There's gonna be a lot of question marks, but if you know, you just know.
[05:21.37]Red is always the bugs?
[05:22.87]Not always.
[05:23.71]Not every time.
[05:28.50]Who loves Red 40?
[05:29.90]I don't love any... I... It doesn't... Okay.
[05:34.78]Is it weird that I would actually be happier if instead of Gatorade Fruit Punch and it's red, just say Gatorade Red and there's no coloring in it and have the branding on the outside be red?
[05:50.73]You know what I mean?
[05:53.31]Like, it could be Gatorade Fruit Punch, Gatorade Red.
[05:55.37]It's just red stuff all over it.
[05:59.42]I think I'd be fine.
[06:01.64]Gatorade Blue.
[06:02.90]I mean, okay, you know Capri Sun?
[06:05.22]Capri Sun is a clear liquid.
[06:08.79]They have that hidden secret pouch, the secret pouch.
[06:13.07]You don't know what's in there.
[06:15.81]I think it's a pretty clear liquid that's in all the Capri Suns.
[06:27.13]Sorry, I'm not American.
[06:34.27]Or you could just drink water.
[06:35.71]That's true.
[06:37.63]But I'm trying to get a little bit of extra electrolytes as I'm having some issues.
[06:43.18]So I'm getting electrolytes from it.
[06:49.53]Plus, it's the same color as a health potion, so I like it.
[06:56.85]Okay, today we're going to play.
[06:59.13]We're going to do UFO 50 again.
[07:01.49]I have a confession to make to all of you here.
[07:04.14]I played it off stream a little bit.
[07:07.28]I cleared a whole nother row.
[07:08.58]It's still like a whole row or two.
[07:11.62]I think there's at least one full row that I haven't seen.
[07:14.19]But I want to play some of the other ones that I have played because I like them.
[07:24.43]How could you?
[07:25.50]I know.
[07:26.78]I didn't finish it off stream.
[07:27.96]I just checked a handful of them out off stream.
[07:41.54]Please play the aw sweet game.
[07:44.98]We're going to play a bunch of them.
[07:45.99]Alright, let's go.
[07:48.33]Hey, I got like the only thing I got to talk about today is UFO 50, so let's go.
[07:57.34]actually that's not all okay that's not it that's not accurate uh the Discord is getting into that kind of slower mode after the stream tonight that's kind of a big deal yeah what about the candle it's going to be rev it's going to revolutionize gaming I'll talk about it a little bit later and don't steal this if you okay if you take this idea from me I've said this before but it has legal standing
[08:22.78]If I, if I give you an idea and you do it, and if I tell you about the candle and one of you devs, one of you fucking super like 500 IQ brain people, like make like a, make the candle.
[08:31.38]I want 7% of the revenue.
[08:32.44]You're going to have to give it to me.
[08:34.08]Like you just are.
[08:35.06]It's going to make, it's going to make a hundred million dollars.
[08:37.18]You can give me seven.
[08:38.26]Okay.
[08:38.42]Alright, let's go.
[08:44.42]You're going to tell me how the, uh, how the temperature is of the audio.
[08:53.20]No, seven million.
[08:54.24]Seven percent.
[08:55.19]Not seven dollars.
[08:55.99]Seven million.
[09:00.31]How does it look?
[09:00.65]Do we look good?
[09:02.55]Yeah, this is what I... I may have gone... I did more than one row.
[09:05.95]Whatever.
[09:06.25]This is the best game in the whole thing.
[09:10.08]Look, there's still... I have a ton that I haven't even seen yet.
[09:13.30]And to be fair, I did only open these once for maybe 10 seconds.
[09:17.40]I will prove it to you.
[09:19.42]Oh, liar, liar.
[09:20.26]We can look at the game actual time I've played.
[09:22.69]Time spent?
[09:23.83]Where is it?
[09:24.41]Where's time spent?
[09:26.47]Three minutes, okay?
[09:27.53]I didn't even play it.
[09:30.35]Oops.
[09:34.57]That's enough to just read the instructions.
[09:37.48]Playtime.
[09:38.88]One minute.
[09:41.90]Playtime on this one.
[09:45.29]40 minutes.
[09:46.11]Uh, I've played this one quite a bit actually.
[09:47.89]Oops.
[09:50.05]The gist of it is most of them I just opened for like 10 seconds.
[09:56.59]I didn't know you could read a... Shut a front door.
[10:01.41]Okay, so in the ones I haven't seen, let's do it.
[10:04.79]So this is Rakshasa.
[10:11.82]I'm excited.
[10:12.72]I held back on opening all these.
[10:19.10]quiet night in the zero valley much like any other okay like ghouls and ghosts okay I already like it take a look at the controls jump attack and charge attack
[10:49.24]Ooh.
[11:00.08]That's video game seconds.
[11:01.98]Wait, is it video game seconds or is it real seconds?
[11:09.29]I think it's real seconds.
[11:11.41]How did I jump on that exactly?
[11:20.13]Video game seconds sometimes can be two or three times as fast.
[11:24.11]Alright, let's do this one again.
[11:32.91]I didn't know that can happen in the very beginning.
[11:37.47]Don't call me washed.
[11:43.56]Okay, so I guess you have infinite lives.
[11:47.50]But it's incredibly dangerous.
[11:50.31]Fireball?
[11:51.03]Oh, you can drop down too.
[11:51.99]Good.
[11:56.75]Kind of like... Okay.
[11:58.41]Kind of like Contra.
[11:59.41]Kind of like Mega Man.
[12:00.27]Oh, you have to get all three?
[12:06.48]That sucks.
[12:07.26]Okay, we're good.
[12:14.94]Don't spawn out of... This thing is going to annoy me.
[12:25.80]That's so many to get.
[12:26.68]Oh my god, they really don't want you to win.
[12:34.54]This is harder than the regular game.
[12:38.20]No, don't hit me!
[12:43.21]Oh my god, I'm so... You move too slow.
[12:46.17]I need games that are fast.
[12:48.03]Oh my god.
[12:53.35]I'm kind of addicted to this, though.
[12:55.12]Already in ninth place.
[12:55.96]That's not terrible.
[12:56.94]Don't say, say calm down.
[12:58.42]No, I'm fine.
[13:00.92]I think we can use the analog for this.
[13:02.18]It feels like an analog game, even though this part is not analog.
[13:06.10]The other one is analog.
[13:09.60]I did that one.
[13:10.18]I did that one.
[13:10.60]Was this in the rings?
[13:13.82]Did I?
[13:17.51]I always hated games where things just spawned behind you, like Contra.
[13:20.91]Even after you kill stuff.
[13:28.17]Gotta go slow.
[13:28.71]Slow it down.
[13:29.19]This is not a- I mean, I have a timer, but it's like two full minutes.
[13:32.12]At some point, you do have to kind of keep moving, though.
[13:48.91]That did not actually even hit me at all.
[13:50.67]I swear to God.
[14:02.65]oh these fucking old ass games where's the checkpoint how come there's no checkpoint and why how come there's no um this is actually kind of annoying why is there no energy shield that fills up where I can take a fuckload of damage and then it doesn't hurt my health yet and if I don't get hit for five seconds I get a whole nother health bar of energy shield
[14:26.84]These old games, really.
[14:28.04]Kind of bullshit.
[14:30.20]Yeah, and where's the red flashing indicator that I'm taking damage?
[14:40.55]With the direction that the damage is coming from.
[14:45.75]And freeze frames when I get hit, so I know that I can look around and see where I need to dodge.
[14:51.20]What's up with gaming?
[14:56.36]Ohhhh!
[15:11.79]Okay, they can't jump.
[15:15.97]Okay, you have to have forward momentum where you can't jump forward.
[15:18.48]Something's going to spawn out of here and it's going to piss me off.
[15:25.82]I want the spread.
[15:27.24]That was always the best thing in Contra.
[15:32.90]Extra time, good.
[15:34.23]Boss.
[15:40.23]That was fucking weird.
[15:50.54]Let's go.
[16:05.38]I played enough Cuphead to know how that one was going to work.
[16:11.26]Oh god.
[16:13.24]Oh god.
[16:16.68]Slow moving bullshit.
[16:19.34]Woo!
[16:21.21]No, I didn't want to switch that out.
[16:23.01]Actually, this thing's kind of good.
[16:24.15]It's homing?
[16:25.41]Perfect.
[16:33.19]You've got to be shitting me.
[16:34.23]It's alright, I'm good.
[16:47.03]Yes.
[16:50.61]Can they jump up?
[16:52.09]Yes, they can.
[16:52.69]That's scary.
[16:54.65]Egg?
[16:58.81]Oh, it's Phoenix familiar.
[17:05.72]Already dead?
[17:06.28]Okay.
[17:06.54]Well, that's good.
[17:13.01]God damn bullshit, man.
[17:14.67]This fucking game.
[17:19.77]God damn it!
[17:26.37]Damn.
[17:27.01]Okay, this one is hard.
[17:28.37]I'll give this one one more go.
[17:30.28]This one's very tricky.
[17:32.78]It's very good, though.
[17:33.40]I like this one.
[17:33.88]This one's up there.
[17:39.76]I would appreciate when you get hit, it goes...
[17:42.80]And you lose one heart container.
[17:45.56]Get the fuck out of here.
[17:48.32]Alright, this is called Star Waspier.
[18:03.63]Do the noise.
[18:04.67]I just did.
[18:07.09]Okay.
[18:39.89]the ships are different this one's twin this one's single this one's single I'll go with the twin twin shooter oh I know what this is gonna be like first extend to 25 000 points I'm gonna be obsessed with this one I don't care how long it takes enjoy the rest of the stream because it's this bomb is oh only in the red ship okay
[19:19.08]What are these G's?
[19:20.25]What is this?
[19:22.15]G and E?
[19:34.82]I'm not exactly sure what I'm doing, but I'm picking up... Okay, what am I doing here?
[19:42.17]I'll get this one.
[19:44.17]It's gun and energy.
[19:58.60]So when you get three, you reset it.
[20:09.66]How much would I worry about getting these?
[20:13.99]I feel like I'm prioritizing getting them when maybe I shouldn't be.
[20:27.78]Ooh, I got tripled.
[20:31.87]Oh, I understand what's going on.
[20:33.01]I get it.
[20:34.27]I get it.
[20:34.57]You have to... I get it.
[20:37.87]You want three of the same one.
[20:41.61]Or maybe not.
[21:06.63]You gonna play Cod next?
[21:08.95]No.
[21:09.11]I don't think so.
[21:23.02]Let me, I wanna say, let me do, I'm gonna do an experiment here.
[21:25.53]If I just get three E's, what happens?
[21:33.77]Don't get any G's, just get three E's.
[21:44.05]Okay.
[21:51.63]You can do... That's interesting.
[21:53.61]If I tap instead of holding it, you kind of do a weird little... Just like a little shimmy.
[22:11.85]Maybe that's the special power of this ship.
[22:24.68]Get in there.
[22:29.79]Ooh.
[22:33.51]Boss?
[22:34.21]No, wave two.
[22:34.71]Good.
[22:40.16]With all bullet hell games, the majority of your time should be spent looking at the two or three inches around your character.
[22:47.48]Forget about all the other shit that's happening on the screen.
[22:53.40]All that matters is you survive.
[22:55.95]It can be distracting.
[23:16.38]Good.
[23:17.00]Look at this power I got.
[23:22.76]An exception.
[23:36.37]That's a weird attack.
[23:50.87]Oh, a good one heart container came out of me.
[24:10.76]Don't kill me!
[24:11.28]This thing charges?
[24:15.22]Since when?
[24:34.06]Those things...
[24:50.15]I'm getting overwhelmed.
[24:56.75]Damn it.
[25:13.14]Fuck.
[25:14.24]Oh, I was doing so good.
[25:16.38]Damn it.
[25:16.94]How far did I get?
[25:23.35]He's not speaking, but he can game.
[25:27.93]This one's good.
[25:30.31]I might come back to this one.
[25:31.69]This one.
[25:36.43]Oh, let me try a different ship.
[25:37.69]That's true.
[25:42.58]We'll go one, two, three.
[25:43.74]Okay, I'll do two more and I'll try the different ships.
[25:50.08]What constitutes shooting?
[25:51.80]Oh, tap is spread.
[25:54.24]Hold is... This is way better than the other one.
[25:57.60]Alright, this is going to be the one.
[26:03.19]Watch this.
[26:04.83]That asteroid level sucks, but we're good.
[26:22.63]I tried to get under it.
[26:23.29]What's this candle game?
[26:30.03]It's going to be huge.
[26:31.72]Is there enough people here for me to talk about it?
[26:33.04]I'll talk about it in a minute.
[26:49.62]Prioritize staying alive.
[26:53.58]Okay, this is one of those games, by the way, that is an eye treadmill.
[26:56.87]And this is what I mean by that, is when I'm done playing this, I'm going to feel like I'm still moving.
[27:04.61]It's like, you guys have played Guitar Hero for a long time, and you do anything else, and the world is moving down fast like a Guitar Hero map.
[27:12.57]I feel like that's going to happen soon here.
[27:19.31]Ah, worse places for the spawn.
[27:48.89]The only thing this game is missing is every 10,000 points, somebody going... Excellent!
[28:13.96]Alright, I haven't died once.
[28:15.04]Let's go.
[28:16.71]I'm getting to world eight, whatever the max one is.
[28:19.09]I just realized how fucking weird I probably look.
[28:44.60]What about a grown man sitting here like with his head back?
[28:47.92]Just silently playing this game.
[28:49.41]Alright.
[28:50.33]I'm doing good.
[28:50.73]Quiet.
[28:53.03]Fuck no.
[28:58.43]Oh my god.
[28:59.23]Whatever.
[28:59.57]I'll come back to it.
[29:00.25]I just keep thinking about the way that I look.
[29:06.21]Like, if I was on one of those reality shows, and there's just, oh, there's a camera in the living room, and it's like, look, it's dark, and he's hanging out in the living room.
[29:14.60]I would get kicked off.
[29:16.54]I'd get voted off the show.
[29:17.72]I'd be boring.
[29:21.56]Oh, try the other ship, right.
[29:26.17]People would be screaming at each other, like, what did you do?
[29:29.55]You cheated on me with him?
[29:32.05]And I wouldn't, I would just be down here playing fucking Star Wasp.
[29:35.69]Silent.
[29:39.33]And the people, the producers would come in and be like, hey Jeremy, um...
[29:43.49]Maybe like we'll get you in the situation where like, you know, we're going to have Dan's going to come in with groceries and we're thinking about maybe you when he comes in, just talk about like his shoes.
[29:53.97]He's wearing like sandals today and he's like went out with shoes and sandals and socks.
[29:58.00]I'm still going to be staring at the screen.
[30:01.02]I'm not going to be acknowledging the person talking to me.
[30:11.50]Really just don't like the vibe you have here.
[30:15.31]And I'm still going to be playing.
[30:23.07]They would come in and have the contract that I signed to be on the show.
[30:26.69]This is like four or five days later after telling me that they don't want me there anymore.
[30:32.64]This one's kind of good.
[30:35.62]And they'd be like, hey, hey, bro, you got to sign this.
[30:38.48]It's time for you to go.
[30:39.20]I still wouldn't even say I would still be on this level.
[30:45.70]Hey, anybody like, can anybody like, anybody power of attorney on him or anything?
[30:48.86]Like, how do we get, how do we get, he needs to sign this.
[31:08.80]And then I would finally, they would take the TV and me sitting in a seated position with it all, everything still plugged in.
[31:16.32]And they would move me out of the house, like with it still on.
[31:19.81]And I'm in a seated position and they're like carrying me.
[31:30.25]And then like three days later, they'll do those interviews and everyone's going to miss me.
[31:35.61]You know, this wouldn't happen if, if Jeremy was still in the house.
[31:42.01]And there's just a spot on the sofa.
[31:45.16]It's just a big fucking like brown indent on the sofa.
[31:49.10]It's like dirty where I was sitting and they'd like, no one sat there since.
[31:52.06]It's just, it's not even like, it's not, it's just like filth.
[32:02.43]It's not like anything gross.
[32:03.67]It's just like, like indent.
[32:06.40]It's just gross indent.
[32:12.18]It's kind of like a little bit... It's like a leather couch.
[32:14.58]You know when a leather couch gets a little worn?
[32:16.24]It kind of has that darker kind of tint to it.
[32:19.63]Nothing's wrong with it.
[32:20.39]It's just kind of gross looking.
[32:29.47]Shit.
[32:32.73]I thought that was good.
[32:33.77]The green one.
[32:58.81]Okay, so the candle.
[33:00.63]Think about this.
[33:01.34]Listen to this.
[33:04.24]A horror game.
[33:05.99]Remember, I get 7% of all the sales.
[33:11.04]where the whole game is about escaping a castle.
[33:14.70]There's a bunch of scary shit in the castle or in like a bunch of caves.
[33:19.30]The whole thing is that you start the game, there's a one like foot long wax candle on the bureau when you start.
[33:30.19]That candle burns in real time over four hours.
[33:37.55]It is the only item that you're allowed to have.
[33:40.83]After four hours, it goes out.
[33:43.27]And there's no light for the rest of the entire experience.
[33:47.77]The candle.
[33:49.21]Rated R. Oh, I forgot to say there's no pausing either.
[34:08.50]So everyone, it's a one hour experience and there's no pausing.
[34:14.36]Think about how people will be talking about that.
[34:15.96]Dude, I had to like piss wicked bad, but like that fucking candle, man, the monster got me.
[34:24.01]All the speed runners would eat that game up so much.
[34:27.79]There's no sprint though.
[34:30.46]And you get a gun with two bullets.
[34:37.55]And at the end of the game, everybody realizes at the end, the huge twist is the alien, the monster was inside of you the whole time.
[34:46.79]So if you don't have any bullets left shooting at the monsters, are you going to get rid of the monster?
[34:55.17]That's like growing out of your arm.
[34:57.78]What the fuck, dude?
[35:01.48]Wait a minute.
[35:02.08]It was me.
[35:02.82]I have to shoot my arm off and I don't have any bullets left.
[35:05.88]Candle.
[35:17.71]Alright, I'm fucking done with this game.
[35:24.15]And you can miss this shot, too.
[35:26.57]The monster, like, comes out of your arm and is like, like, facing you.
[35:30.72]But it's kind of dodging and dodging, dodging.
[35:32.72]So it's like, what the fuck?
[35:33.66]I just missed twice.
[35:35.16]Game over.
[35:36.42]Better grab that candle from the bureau again at the very beginning.
[35:38.96]One hour.
[35:49.72]Nobody said, were you a test tube, baby?
[35:56.59]Uh, no.
[35:58.57]What the fuck, what do you care?
[36:03.41]What the fuck do you care?
[36:12.70]Oh, also, when the candle gets to be the last 10 minutes, because the wax is burning so close down to your hand, you take periodic tick damage from the heat of the candle burning you.
[36:23.66]What, are you going to put it down?
[36:25.68]No, you can't put it down.
[36:26.36]You have to hold it.
[36:40.43]That's immersion.
[36:43.64]You can't put it down.
[36:47.48]Also, if you bring the candle too close to you and look at stuff, you can burn your face.
[36:52.90]And you take damage as well.
[36:55.84]Okay, Lily O'Mule.
[36:57.00]Thank you for all making the journey here.
[37:00.25]Despite my reputation.
[37:02.29]I reached out to many, but only you seven chose to meet me and hear what I have to say.
[37:09.05]Is it a VR game?
[37:09.99]It could be.
[37:17.99]So we've been suffering in hell for 15 years and the war seems endless, yet not as all as it seems.
[37:23.03]There is hope.
[37:24.53]We band together and hmm, what's that smell?
[37:29.72]VR makes this idea way better.
[37:35.24]Well, it could be VR optional.
[37:44.24]Is that an angel?
[37:48.58]The fire is going to burn the saloon down soon.
[37:51.04]I'll save as many as I can.
[37:52.16]Oh shit, hold on.
[37:58.70]Strong spiritual aura surrounds this woman.
[38:00.98]You can tell she has a close relationship with multiple dimensions.
[38:04.50]I don't know if they're worth saving.
[38:06.44]I just gotta check everybody.
[38:07.18]It's a lean man with a handsome face and cauliflower ears.
[38:12.97]There is a feeling of resilience about him.
[38:15.47]Okay, hold on.
[38:19.23]This beautiful young woman is dressed like a dancer.
[38:21.55]She radiates a fierce independence.
[38:24.85]Okay.
[38:27.43]This cowboy has a tough exterior, but you sense a gentle soul inside.
[38:31.84]There's sadness and determination in his eyes.
[38:33.70]Okay.
[38:39.68]You recognize her from wanted posters.
[38:41.44]She's a notorious outlaw known for her deadly aim.
[38:43.96]I don't know if they're worth saving.
[38:48.06]It's a one-armed man who is sharply dressed.
[38:50.53]Next to him is a candle.
[38:52.99]It's a doctor's bag.
[38:54.09]Oh, okay.
[38:54.75]This is a medic.
[38:55.39]It's a tall, elegantly dressed woman.
[39:02.79]In her muscular arms, she grips a large purse very tightly.
[39:06.96]Lots of money.
[39:07.44]Okay.
[39:09.64]Okay.
[39:12.73]Strong spiritual aura surrounds this woman.
[39:14.21]You can tell she has a clue.
[39:15.75]Yep.
[39:16.87]Definitely dimensional stuff here.
[39:18.03]Okay.
[39:24.29]I want the doctor.
[39:27.88]How many can I save?
[39:33.00]Purse.
[39:38.14]Oh, shit.
[39:38.50]There's another one.
[39:41.35]This one-eyed dog lays quietly next to Lillial Mule, who has sadly succumbed to the heat.
[39:45.73]Okay, we'll take dog.
[39:49.69]Is it how many?
[39:50.21]I guess I can have more.
[39:50.93]Wait.
[39:52.43]We need, we need, is anybody here DPS?
[39:54.41]Like, how does this work?
[39:58.21]Wasn't there a Gunslinger?
[40:02.00]Resilience?
[40:09.64]Cow, oh no, the cowboy.
[40:12.82]Oh, the outlaw.
[40:13.68]Wait.
[40:13.88]Do I want like tank?
[40:16.36]This is definitely tank.
[40:18.30]I'm taking tank.
[40:21.94]You feel very weak and the heat from the blaze is becoming unbearable.
[40:25.16]It's time to leave while you still can.
[40:30.46]Is this a good party?
[40:31.06]It looks like a good party.
[40:33.35]I don't know.
[40:40.96]Holy shit, this is like a... This is like a full-on... When I saw that no-good varmint lily-o-mule enter the saloon, I knew something bad was going to happen.
[40:53.68]Can't believe anyone survived that fire.
[40:55.49]Thank began.
[41:00.87]Is a dog 10 out of 10?
[41:01.75]True.
[41:05.78]To the north is the city of Santonio.
[41:07.90]To the south is the Mission Francesco.
[41:10.82]We could have burned down the saloon.
[41:19.52]I was planning on talking to the bartender tonight.
[41:21.90]Now he's charcoal.
[41:32.52]Welcome to the pleasant hotel.
[41:33.92]If you need a room, it'll be 10 teeth.
[41:36.83]I have no teeth.
[41:37.53]Is that a chest or something?
[41:40.97]No, it's a stool.
[41:53.16]Store.
[41:54.82]Welcome to the general store.
[41:57.66]I need money.
[42:02.53]Nope, wrong way.
[42:06.75]When are we going to play the next candle like?
[42:08.33]I thought like maybe one day.
[42:16.53]I would figure out how to just make just dog shit games.
[42:22.30]Just like I don't even care, right?
[42:24.20]Just release them and like don't I don't even care.
[42:28.11]Not like, oh, hey man, this like, can you fix this, this patch, a patch, this, I'm not sure, this is kind of, no, what you get is what you get, I don't give a shit.
[42:35.77]I would just release it, I wouldn't even, wouldn't do anything else to it.
[42:38.97]There would be a disclaimer at the beginning of any game that I would ever want to make.
[42:42.61]It would literally say, hey, there will never be an update to this, I don't listen to any feedback, I don't care about anything, don't fucking even try to talk to me, this game is just the way it is, and here it is.
[42:57.98]Because I know the games will have problems.
[43:00.08]You know what I mean?
[43:00.60]Like, I know the games would be like bad.
[43:02.80]There'd be something really bad about them.
[43:06.74]So I would just make sure people knew in the beginning.
[43:09.11]Hey, this game sucks.
[43:11.51]I don't care.
[43:30.05]I love people saying like that's any different right now.
[43:34.45]No, I gotta talk to people.
[43:37.71]Would you charge money for it?
[43:39.75]I mean, if I knew they were pieces of shit, no.
[43:42.33]I would just like put it on whatever, like one of those like indie sites.
[43:46.93]But if they were good, if they were good enough, then maybe I would.
[43:51.01]I don't know.
[43:52.37]Probably not.
[43:53.97]But what if it was good?
[43:55.21]What if I was like, holy shit, this is awesome.
[43:56.82]I just made the candle.
[43:59.18]This is worth like $3, right?
[44:00.56]This is worth $5 if it's the candle and it actually is good.
[44:06.18]If I get to the end of playtesting the candle, and nobody in the room claps, and like the four or five of us have that bottle of champagne and it just doesn't get opened, and it's just like, that was a fun experiment.
[44:19.15]Nope.
[44:19.91]I think we're just going to release this.
[44:30.29]We give thanks and praise to Big End.
[44:31.99]He's the creator of all things who watches over and protects us.
[44:37.68]If I ever was going to do something like that, it would literally just be of like a one, a one to two man project.
[44:45.01]It would just be for fun.
[44:45.93]I would just be doing it for fun if I ever did.
[44:47.73]It is so difficult to learn anything.
[44:51.59]But you know, who knows?
[44:52.73]I'm not going to, I'm not going to say I wouldn't ever one day.
[44:58.08]Just walking around talking.
[44:59.28]I know this is what I did.
[45:00.82]I know.
[45:04.36]What a perfect game to open.
[45:05.74]The one where you don't have to do anything.
[45:06.97]You can just walk around.
[45:07.75]I can just tell you what my video game enterprise I'm not going to have.
[45:12.21]I feel like I can go back here.
[45:19.28]Oh, no.
[45:24.52]Is the candle going to have mocap?
[45:28.96]Yeah, the monster is going to be like nine million dollars.
[45:33.22]I'm gonna be a full, like, Hollywood actor mocap specialist.
[45:46.35]With everything.
[45:46.79]With, like, you know, like, jiggle physics.
[45:49.07]With, like, fucking... the bones in every finger and stuff.
[45:53.83]Like, it's gonna be crazy.
[46:06.18]Look out.
[46:11.14]Oh, it is.
[46:12.26]It's a Final Fantasy type kind of game.
[46:24.25]Ouch.
[46:28.23]Oh shit.
[46:28.79]Umbra.
[46:29.63]Umbra is dead.
[46:33.85]Rufus hits Hawk for 31 damage.
[46:38.03]Oh, this timed hits.
[46:42.99]You can do super timed hits.
[46:47.46]Uh, imagine the doctor has... nothing.
[46:56.22]I like, this is cool.
[46:57.03]I would put time into this.
[47:01.64]This feels like a fun game to really kind of get into.
[47:08.32]Hawk 2.
[47:09.18]Oh, I said it.
[47:15.61]Dog is level 2.
[47:19.61]Rufus is leveled up.
[47:25.07]Is Umber dead dead?
[47:28.70]No, that's not how these games work.
[47:30.38]Holy shit, Umbra is dead in a coffin.
[47:33.55]What?
[47:38.65]Oh my god, it's dead!
[47:42.55]Dead?
[47:52.40]That's not good.
[47:58.43]Shit.
[48:00.03]I need money.
[48:00.81]Everybody's going to die.
[48:19.28]Six teeth.
[48:19.84]Alright.
[48:20.92]I like this one, actually, a lot.
[48:23.95]I can feel this one growing on me.
[48:28.34]Should I just keep going up?
[48:30.64]I feel like everyone's going to die if I don't get healing items.
[48:39.75]Is there any skills left?
[48:40.77]Are there any skills yet?
[48:44.13]Why did it just skip over the dog?
[48:46.36]What's up with that?
[48:55.07]And how come the dog doesn't have a timed hit?
[48:58.35]The dog just kind of picks... Okay, the dog does what the dog wants.
[49:01.53]I'm realizing this now.
[49:16.57]Don't die!
[49:27.06]Alright, I gotta get to a town.
[49:29.30]Like, now.
[49:30.10]There's one there, right there.
[49:31.02]Come on, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[49:36.19]We made it.
[49:38.07]Welcome to San Tonio.
[49:40.11]Nicest town in hell.
[49:41.47]Can you bring my friend back to life?
[49:47.16]Come on in for the best deals in town!
[49:52.12]Will there be a dog in the candle?
[49:56.71]Yeah, what I'll do is the first room before the game, there's gonna be a lobby before the game starts.
[50:02.23]So the lobby will be just stuff that all gamers and like Redditors and shit like want in their video games.
[50:08.44]And I'm just gonna make sure it's in the pre-lobby game.
[50:12.00]That game, that's gonna have like dogs and cats and like fucking birds flying around.
[50:15.32]There's gonna be like, you can feed them and take care of them and stuff.
[50:17.57]That's not the game.
[50:18.31]That's just the lobby before the game.
[50:19.67]That's before the title screen.
[50:31.22]There'll be, like, games to play.
[50:33.22]There'll be, like, a whole basketball game.
[50:34.99]There'll be, like, a whole baseball game.
[50:36.43]There'll be... There'll be, like, boxes to open and shit.
[50:42.29]And this is all just before the game itself.
[50:46.72]I know this because I like those things.
[50:48.66]And I'm a Redditor.
[51:00.32]How fun would it be to have a game that happens before the game?
[51:03.22]Oh no, it would just be like a fun room.
[51:06.41]It would be like the share on social media room.
[51:11.15]Right?
[51:12.57]The game itself is going to suck.
[51:14.63]But people are not going to talk shit about it because there's going to be 50 dog breeds that are in the pre-game lobby that you can play with and pet and feed and stuff.
[51:32.27]Yeah, there'll be like a car.
[51:33.49]There'll be a racing track that you can just drive around in with wicked fast cars with like Lamborghinis and fucking Corvettes and stuff.
[51:42.95]Because that's like cool.
[51:43.75]You can just do like a bunch of laps.
[51:51.30]Will they be realistic dogs?
[51:53.10]Oh, yeah.
[51:53.44]No, it'd be very realistic.
[51:59.61]This is all just what is equivalent to the previews of the candle.
[52:03.25]Okay.
[52:07.89]I have only... How much... How expensive is this shit?
[52:10.62]40?
[52:10.64]40 teeth for one bandage.
[52:13.48]What does cotton even do?
[52:15.58]Oh, shit.
[52:17.14]That was probably dumb, but I'm getting it.
[52:18.44]How do I get to my... Okay, there we go.
[52:24.51]Uh, I'm gonna give... Yeah.
[52:26.73]I think this is the tank.
[52:33.46]They all have to drop hints to the candle.
[52:39.41]No, no, no.
[52:40.03]They can't be... Because it can't be scary.
[52:50.21]And then before you open the door that goes to the candle... A, like, pop-up comes up that says... Can you review the game?
[52:59.90]Five stars.
[53:01.90]Which will add...
[53:04.56]five minutes to the candle burn time.
[53:16.19]I don't even know if that's legal.
[53:17.45]I don't think you could even do that.
[53:20.06]Can you?
[53:20.46]No, you can't do that.
[53:21.28]That's like illegal.
[53:26.94]Candle microtransaction.
[53:31.56]Somebody just said that's an L game.
[53:40.68]There's a shitload of DRM on it?
[53:42.89]Oh my god, no.
[53:46.61]No guys, we're not making the game that people are going to hate the most.
[53:49.91]We're making a game that people are going to want to like.
[53:52.67]A hundred teeth for a horse?
[53:57.76]What the fuck?
[54:04.63]It's got, like, a bunch of the, like, multiplayer, uh, like, anti-cheat shit on it, and it's like the game doesn't even connect to the internet.
[54:19.99]There's a battle pass.
[54:23.26]Yeah, and the only thing that happens at the end of the battle pass is the candle, at the end, turns into a skull instead.
[54:39.56]I heard rumors from the north of a terrible thunderbird that eats horses.
[54:42.91]I'd love to know if such a thing is real.
[54:54.27]I forgot to mention there's a food and drink meter.
[54:57.45]You have to, like, keep hydrated and keep eating and stuff.
[55:02.68]And all this does is if your drink meter goes to below 10%, you lose like 25% moving speed.
[55:11.09]And water is like a pain in the fucking ass to find too.
[55:14.13]And it's a real, it's not fun.
[55:16.13]It's annoying to find it.
[55:25.53]I need, how am I supposed to live through this?
[55:41.38]Oh, and on the battle pass, there's like the... hearty soup!
[55:46.52]And the hearty soup is you don't have to worry about food or drink.
[56:04.54]I love this one, but I have to pay attention to it.
[56:09.70]And that's clearly not happening.
[56:11.34]I actually genuinely really like this.
[56:22.25]Yeah, and at the end, when it's like, you've done it.
[56:24.71]Congratulations, you've completed the candle.
[56:27.04]You have destroyed...
[56:29.36]The demon that lives inside of you.
[56:31.66]That lives inside of all of us.
[56:33.24]I'll do existential fucking bullshit at the end.
[56:36.62]And then you can pre-order The Candle 2.
[56:40.46]Make sure you reserve your copy of The Candle 2.
[56:43.60]And work has not even started on this.
[56:55.57]Can I heal this way?
[56:58.65]20 teeth, everything is so expensive.
[57:00.05]The candle, yeah, and make sure that there's this player choice where the answers are always a form of yes, a form of yes, a form of look at how sassy I am.
[57:18.34]And they all don't really do any, they all get, they all effectively are you saying yes.
[57:23.86]Yes, yes, look at how sassy I am.
[57:27.86]They're always going to say the same dialogue, but the only difference is the first word or two before their scripted dialogue is either is reacting to how rude you just were.
[57:43.57]Oh, excuse me.
[57:45.75]So when you go to the, yeah, it just won't matter.
[57:52.50]I need more money.
[57:59.15]I need 20 teeth.
[58:16.85]Can you romance the candle?
[58:24.00]No, it's going to be a very focused project on just getting to the end of the experience.
[58:30.78]This has got to be food or... Ooh, bedrolls.
[58:43.93]What's that do?
[58:48.99]What is a bedroll?
[58:52.71]Can we sleep?
[59:07.41]Do you have a chance to sneeze and blow out the candle?
[59:10.51]Yeah, running too fast will blow the candle out.
[59:15.02]And every so often a spooky, a spooky man shows up and like a Bugleberry type.
[59:21.76]Oh, look out, be careful.
[59:23.34]He's the tutorial, right?
[59:24.31]He gives you, he tells you things.
[59:26.17]Don't talk so loudly.
[59:27.39]The candle will blow out.
[59:29.09]That candle is your life force.
[59:32.19]Oh, don't look now.
[59:34.63]And he kind of floats around on your UI.
[59:37.18]Uh, we're dead.
[59:51.77]You need to control breathing.
[59:54.83]Oh, fuck.
[59:56.93]Alright, this one is one of... You're not going to believe this.
[60:00.41]This one's one of my favorite in the whole collection.
[60:03.63]But I'm too... Rufus is dead.
[60:05.51]So therefore, I have... And I didn't do this right.
[60:08.21]This is kind of like a... Like, you got to do it right.
[60:10.97]You got to be into it.
[60:11.73]You got to go for it.
[60:12.45]This is going to be one of my favorites.
[60:13.55]I promise you.
[60:20.15]Okay, let's do this.
[60:35.29]Do I ever play this again?
[60:36.03]Oh, I'm going to.
[60:38.49]Trust me.
[60:40.27]I like this so much, I'm going to be dressing up as one of them for Halloween this year.
[60:46.83]That's how much I like this game.
[60:48.25]That's how you can really tell if somebody likes something.
[60:50.99]Okay, if somebody starts suggesting to you...
[60:53.66]Halloween costumes of a show that you don't really care about, and you don't even realize that they care about it either, that person loves that fucking show so much, and they want you to watch it so bad.
[61:04.96]So, just watch it.
[61:17.01]Halloween has already passed.
[61:20.39]Well, in 330 days, whatever it is.
[61:30.80]Everyone in your posse is dead.
[61:35.58]Thanks to... Oh, wait.
[61:40.46]Oh, you do get to come back.
[61:43.95]Alright, this one is unbelievable.
[61:46.07]I genuinely love it.
[61:47.47]But I want to see the other one.
[61:48.75]Because I feel like that's a... This to me is like a couple of hours commitment, I would imagine.
[61:55.29]Lords of Disconia.
[61:57.35]I want to see the rest of the game.
[62:05.62]He's really high right now?
[62:06.80]I am not.
[62:07.20]How does this work?
[62:14.39]scenario narrow pass that bird just pooped out a scroll your queen demands your help blue raiders are harassing a key mountain pass and must be dealt with prove yourself and more important tasks await okay base camp reserves you have 12 gold
[62:44.72]Found a cache of five gold.
[62:48.05]Hey, hey, how can we get two turns?
[62:50.67]Why do they get two turns?
[62:57.05]Okay, wait.
[62:57.52]You may hire discs at the tavern.
[63:00.20]Ogre, rat, or knight.
[63:01.94]I'm getting an ogre.
[63:04.34]I'm getting two.
[63:04.98]I'm getting three ogres.
[63:09.00]That has a ton of stun and a bunch of... Alright, we're good.
[63:11.83]Is that it?
[63:17.18]Alright, we're going to be in the middle.
[63:21.48]A battle occurs.
[63:29.29]What's going on here?
[63:30.51]Where?
[63:30.83]Okay.
[63:35.05]I'm going to take the ogre.
[63:37.55]And is this money?
[63:39.53]What do I?
[63:43.65]Wait, wait, what's going on?
[63:47.64]Oh!
[63:50.78]Whoa, this is cool.
[63:57.01]You actually have to fire the discs around.
[64:06.96]This is sick.
[64:10.79]Okay, let's get... Is this money?
[64:15.43]Okay, it is money.
[64:16.79]I can hurt myself.
[64:17.45]Oops.
[64:23.98]You don't want an ogre all the way up here.
[64:25.50]This is going to be horrible for them.
[64:38.11]Shit.
[64:44.67]Is it always one damage?
[64:52.24]How much health does everybody have?
[65:06.78]Does power... Ooh.
[65:10.34]You can bounce into... I get it.
[65:12.30]I'm starting to understand what's going on.
[65:15.20]You want to ricochet them into your own guys.
[65:17.38]Alright.
[65:27.71]So if I do this, it's kind of like pool in a way, too, then.
[65:30.07]That's funny.
[65:30.89]Hold on.
[65:31.17]Let's do this.
[65:32.95]Yep.
[65:35.87]This guy gets to go twice.
[65:59.74]Should I get all the money or just kill?
[66:30.59]Kill, kill, kill, kill.
[66:33.79]This one's stunned.
[66:34.51]I fucked up.
[66:54.12]I didn't even know what... Guys, I thought I was going to move these guys and attack with them.
[66:59.08]I didn't know what was going on.
[67:03.90]See, I just bounced him.
[67:10.86]I didn't even know they were discs until we started the battle.
[67:24.47]He's a low IQ.
[67:25.43]Shut the fuck up.
[67:26.33]Hey, shut up.
[67:26.93]No, I'm not.
[67:27.23]I'm smart.
[67:27.75]Shut up.
[67:32.15]Don't let them, don't let them get under your skin.
[67:35.91]Don't let them get to you.
[67:38.06]Don't let them get under your skin.
[67:40.08]That's the song I sing on breaks.
[67:44.04]I just had to sing it now though, just to kind of, I just felt like I had to right now.
[68:00.01]You just killed an ogre.
[68:03.59]Okay, I just won.
[68:20.62]Blue runs home to fetch reserves.
[68:24.40]Wait, I... What do I get for that?
[68:29.76]Can't backtrack.
[68:30.52]Push X to return.
[68:31.88]Wait.
[68:32.08]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[68:33.56]Wait.
[68:33.92]Returning home base.
[68:39.89]Reserves.
[68:41.03]Okay.
[68:41.73]So... Okay.
[68:46.43]I... Okay.
[68:47.13]I guess I kind of understand how this works now.
[68:49.73]Okay.
[68:51.63]I'll get a rat.
[68:53.25]I'll get... Two rats.
[68:58.10]Alright.
[68:58.46]Sounds good.
[69:09.55]I think I'm going to bounce between the two.
[69:18.68]Shit.
[69:18.90]I think it's fine.
[69:25.76]Alright.
[69:26.10]Should I try to bounce him?
[69:27.42]Bounce him into the... Yeah.
[69:30.84]I'll try to get him right on the edge here.
[69:35.64]Do it again.
[69:41.79]oh come on hit it the rat is actually pretty good you can do more than you can do three that's fine
[70:11.47]Rat does low damage, but it has three turns.
[70:14.21]I'm starting to understand the concept of this game, and it's really cool.
[70:18.41]Okay.
[70:21.63]Uh... What do you have over here?
[70:31.96]Try to go for a bounce on these two.
[70:34.96]Can I get through this?
[70:35.74]Let's find out.
[70:42.09]Oops.
[70:52.83]This could be a sport for nerds in real life.
[70:56.85]True.
[71:00.78]You'd need a really good slow-mo camera.
[71:10.46]He's kind of going to kill me.
[71:11.69]I kind of want to just reset because I just bought like three ogres for no reason because I didn't know what the game was until I, you know what I mean?
[71:36.36]Again.
[71:36.56]Okay, that's fine.
[71:42.63]Find a reset.
[71:43.33]I think I should be okay.
[71:55.63]Gonna bully this guy.
[72:04.46]Oh, fuck you.
[72:17.91]That went in the hoop and out of the hoop.
[72:33.16]I think I'll be able to do it with the ogre.
[72:37.75]And I got the money.
[73:13.03]Alright, so I think I'm kind of screwed though.
[73:14.87]Because we both have to go back and regroup.
[73:21.22]How much money does the CPU have?
[73:22.40]Okay, CPU has one guy.
[73:26.30]I think I just have to go for the kill.
[73:42.35]Ogre versus this guy.
[73:46.89]I don't think you're gonna win.
[73:47.81]Okay, well that's... that's really annoying.
[73:57.64]What, it's not stunned?
[73:58.68]Did that take the stun off?
[74:00.12]That's a shitty placement for me!
[74:01.44]I gotta reset.
[74:06.73]Isn't he stunned?
[74:35.29]Reset Randall.
[74:42.50]I think I should reset because he's going to just have money to go buy stuff.
[74:55.11]Do I still have my reserves?
[75:13.30]Shit.
[75:16.54]Guys I thought this was like a Street Fighter game.
[75:21.34]Okay I got my reserves.
[75:23.58]How do I pull them out?
[75:26.92]Did I pull them out?
[75:32.47]Yes, I did.
[75:32.89]Okay.
[75:33.91]Alright.
[75:34.43]Now I'm gonna kick his ass.
[75:37.07]You got one guy.
[75:38.07]Time to- I'm getting that camp.
[75:39.27]Alright, I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.
[75:40.19]We're good, we're good.
[75:40.72]Everything's fine.
[75:41.50]Well, fuck you then.
[76:12.76]Oh, now you're in trouble?
[76:17.21]He just killed everyone!
[76:20.07]Okay, we have to sandwich this guy.
[76:21.51]Fuck you!
[76:26.03]What?! !
[76:36.37]This guy's gonna win.
[76:37.43]I didn't have good placement or anything, and now he like, if you don't want to group shit up, okay.
[76:45.05]Because you can bounce off of each other.
[76:46.81]I was looking at chat, I didn't even see what I just did.
[76:56.16]I thought that was the end of my turn.
[77:04.67]Now I know how the game is played.
[77:09.51]I bought three ogres in the first... And I just was like, I don't care.
[77:13.72]We're talking about the candle.
[77:14.76]I'm not even playing the game.
[77:16.16]Alright, I get it now.
[77:26.09]I'm getting one ogre.
[77:34.86]And then... What do you think?
[77:38.20]Two rats in one night?
[77:46.27]He's got two ogres.
[77:49.71]All rats?
[77:54.63]I think this is good.
[78:01.16]Alright, now get over here.
[78:07.61]Now I get it.
[78:10.92]Where are you?
[78:11.76]Alright, this is a weird field here.
[78:13.10]I'm gonna, okay, the rat's gonna sneak up here.
[78:16.50]Should I just hit the well like three times?
[78:27.70]Or should I just try to cause chaos in there right now?
[78:34.24]Okay, I got the, I got the well.
[78:41.92]Alright, this rat is powered up.
[78:45.00]Hmm.
[78:48.34]I get that.
[78:50.10]OK.
[78:50.88]Where are you going?
[79:28.02]I don't like this guy being here.
[79:29.04]This is probably a bad play, but I don't care.
[79:34.36]There it is.
[79:38.24]I'm going to do this.
[79:39.76]This might be crazy, but I feel like I need to break this up.
[79:43.79]Right?
[79:44.23]I just need to knock these guys all over the place.
[79:50.35]See what I mean?
[79:53.92]Because the ogre doesn't have a turn yet.
[80:03.26]That is exactly why I did that.
[80:10.52]uh do I want to use the rat yeah and then try to bounce him into the other guy should I get a better maybe I should get a better position use the one shot to go down and around or should I try to knock him into the uh guy with the beard
[80:39.14]Okay.
[80:40.48]That's not amazing.
[80:43.44]I'm going for the well.
[80:44.34]No, I'm not.
[80:44.68]What am I doing?
[80:53.25]Where the fuck did he just go?
[80:56.03]Did he not get hit by the other guy?
[80:57.13]He's got nowhere to go.
[81:05.08]Yeah.
[81:07.02]That's fine.
[81:22.24]I just set it up.
[81:30.55]Shit.
[81:36.49]I have to bounce him around in here.
[81:41.99]This is no good angle.
[81:48.93]I could knock this guy into that.
[81:50.59]Because he's going to die anyways.
[81:53.32]I could bounce off the well and hopefully hit something.
[82:00.64]I could bounce off the wall and hope I could angle him up.
[82:03.88]But he's an ogre though.
[82:04.66]Is he going to move that much?
[82:05.47]Hmm.
[82:15.11]Kind of.
[82:17.48]Uh... I could do it again.
[82:25.68]Is that gonna move him enough if I bond?
[82:28.04]I gotta get the right angle.
[82:32.78]Oh, fuck you!
[82:34.66]This is very bad.
[82:35.38]That's bad.
[82:47.60]Mmm, that's actually not the worst thing that could have happened.
[82:52.35]Because now we might be able to kill this.
[82:57.47]I'm thinking pick this guy and shoot him to the left and have him bounce around everybody.
[83:00.51]That's what I'm doing.
[83:06.90]Right there.
[83:09.36]Good.
[83:10.24]Okay, now we gotta take care of this guy.
[83:19.36]I'm okay with that.
[83:21.16]Now we're going to steal the well.
[83:26.50]I think I'm happy with what just happened.
[83:30.32]Now here's the question.
[83:36.53]He's got so much shit over here.
[83:38.35]Hmm.
[83:54.92]the rat and steal maybe just hit the well with this guy try to bounce him I could try to bounce him with this I think I'm gonna try it now he's too flush on the wall
[84:23.56]I kind of need to move this out of the way.
[84:27.94]Where's the right place to try to push him?
[84:31.86]I could move to the right and then shoot him to the left.
[84:38.17]I could go a wrap around.
[84:39.63]This is a game with a lot of different potentials.
[84:41.99]And when there's a lot of different potentials, I just go, where's the dodge and attack button?
[84:47.23]This is great, though.
[84:47.83]I love this one.
[84:49.13]Uh, I'm gonna do this, and it's really stupid, and people are gonna do the not like this face.
[84:55.94]Turns out it wasn't the worst idea.
[84:57.24]Ah!
[85:09.28]Ah!
[85:17.94]okay he didn't do it don't kill him oh you how come they didn't kill him you lose
[85:47.27]Yeah, this game is really awesome.
[85:51.04]But if you're a pool player, you're going to want to play this one.
[85:54.32]If you don't play pool a lot, I'll tell you to avoid this one.
[86:03.74]It was a joke.
[86:04.65]I'm kidding.
[86:05.11]I think it's amazing.
[86:06.97]I have to do this though.
[86:14.37]I still could do it.
[86:17.29]It's still possible.
[86:19.77]The rat has a million health.
[86:20.87]I just have to be a little shit and play like a total coward.
[86:33.96]He bounced to the worst possible way.
[86:35.34]Okay, now I'm gonna hide up there.
[86:46.04]What?
[86:46.48]What do you mean, don't end your turn in the fog?
[86:50.62]What do you mean the... Wait, wait, what's going on?
[87:01.57]Is this... I'm not supposed to be here?
[87:14.67]It's like steal this shit.
[87:15.95]Okay.
[87:16.19]Watch this right.
[87:19.31]Oh, fuck you.
[87:26.65]Okay.
[87:26.97]So don't.
[87:39.22]I'm good.
[87:43.18]So if you end your turn in the fog twice, you die.
[87:45.52]I love how you get to go first and get the perfect angle.
[88:12.64]Okay, this one is... You probably shouldn't have left the party angry.
[88:28.52]Amy was out of line, but then again, she's been going through a lot.
[88:33.43]Wait, what's that?
[88:37.99]Night Manor.
[88:44.18]Warning, this game contains scenes of horror and dread.
[88:46.04]Player discretion advised.
[88:48.32]Also, I don't give a fuck about feedback.
[88:51.58]I don't listen to anything.
[88:53.42]There will never be a patch for this game.
[88:57.41]That's what I'd be like.
[89:00.85]You got it, man.
[89:07.27]Where am I?
[89:08.07]You mutter as you wake up in a strange room.
[89:11.13]The last thing you remember is driving your car.
[89:14.57]And then you hit something in the road.
[89:17.42]Disoriented, you try to make sense of your new surroundings.
[89:23.94]It's a point and click horror game.
[89:27.06]The small and dingy storage room has been repurposed as a holding cell.
[89:31.94]Years of dirt and grime cling to the walls.
[89:38.24]Yes, this is the cameo version of Bugleberry.
[89:43.39]Yes, this is the, can you please record a voicemail for my cell phone as your character?
[89:50.60]Thank you.
[89:53.30]Oh, you've reached John.
[89:56.28]He can't come to the phone right now, but he's a spooky fellow.
[90:05.71]You shudder at the realization that you were curled up on this ragged mattress just moments ago.
[90:12.78]The small and dingy storage room has been repurposed.
[90:14.86]Okay, is there a different... Is there anything... Okay, this looks like there's a grab?
[90:23.48]Look and use.
[90:24.33]Okay.
[90:26.23]It's like a spoon.
[90:27.01]Metal spoon with a flat handle.
[90:30.13]There appears to be bite marks over it.
[90:33.65]Ooh.
[90:35.83]Took the bowl and the spoon.
[90:38.49]All we need now is Captain Crunch cereal.
[90:45.75]Captain Crunch opens the door.
[90:49.81]Sorry I locked you in the basement.
[90:53.87]Boards don't budge.
[90:56.65]Even if you could reach this trapdoor, you'd probably have no way of opening it.
[90:59.47]Okay, so pry open the vent.
[91:04.63]Okay, pry open the vent with the spoon.
[91:11.53]Yeah!
[91:11.81]Okay, what's in there?
[91:15.22]You take the folded piece of paper and a hairpin holding it together.
[91:18.56]What does it say?
[91:22.88]Lost his mind.
[91:24.70]Why?
[91:29.74]Simple Bobby pin.
[91:30.82]Okay.
[91:31.07]Can I use the pin on the door?
[91:37.85]You stick the hairpin into the lock and wiggle it around and the hairpin becomes stuck, but you hear the lock click open.
[91:47.71]Doors open and you're free to leave if you dare.
[91:49.65]Hallway stretches out before you with a staircase at the end.
[91:57.69]Pale moonlight shines in from a door to your left.
[92:03.80]It's this.
[92:05.76]An unassuming wooden door.
[92:07.36]It's closed.
[92:11.99]This simple tile floor bathroom is fairly clean despite the clogging smell of mildew hanging in the air.
[92:19.14]I think it's nearly overflowing with putrid brown water.
[92:28.99]You really don't want to put your hand in that foul water.
[92:32.91]Yes, I do.
[92:34.48]Or I wouldn't have switched to the hand tool and hit the click button.
[92:39.99]You open the medicine cabinet, inside you find a pair of tweezers.
[92:47.78]The toilet flushes loudly.
[92:50.70]What the fuck was that?
[92:51.28]Does it knock at the door?
[93:01.55]Okay, now you're just playing around!
[93:04.03]Stop wasting water!
[93:06.31]You're a real dick, you know that?
[93:09.11]He pulled the shower curtain away to reveal a shocking sight.
[93:12.53]A skeleton man.
[93:16.67]The mummified corpse in the tub is encrusted with mold and fungi.
[93:24.98]Take some tweezers and, like, take a sample.
[93:27.70]The edge of the tweezers keeps slipping off the, ugh, hand of the mummy.
[93:31.36]It's hard to find a good angle.
[93:34.17]Take one of his teeth.
[93:36.77]Take one of the mushrooms.
[93:38.57]Eat mushroom.
[93:40.40]I'm going to eat the mushroom on the corpse.
[93:43.98]That's when the DM just kind of like, who fucking invited this guy?
[93:48.08]We had a thing going.
[93:50.02]We had a good group going and you brought the guy that like, I'm going to eat the, I'm going to drink the poop water.
[93:54.69]It's like, I didn't plan for somebody this annoying.
[94:01.67]Okay, so there's something.
[94:02.47]It's like a ring.
[94:04.59]Try as you might, you have no success in removing the ring that's seemingly fused to the corpse's finger.
[94:13.52]Scoop up some of the fucking water?
[94:18.06]You look over your shoulder to see the bathroom behind you.
[94:19.88]Why?
[94:27.47]Why?
[94:32.49]Why not?
[94:33.03]Okay, well, I need that ring.
[94:37.07]I can't do it yet.
[94:41.42]I got tweezers.
[94:44.18]Okay, that bottom right room is the bed.
[94:45.78]This one's the bathroom.
[94:46.52]Let's try this one.
[94:51.79]The bedroom appears to have common amenities, but nothing too specific.
[94:56.17]Whoa.
[94:57.57]Indicating that it is possibly a guest room.
[95:01.99]Wait, what's that?
[95:03.16]You take the journal entry.
[95:10.42]May 27th, 1987.
[95:12.80]Things have been tense with Cheryl since losing my job with the firm.
[95:16.83]I had to calmly explain to her that our financial situation is not in jeopardy and that she can continue working on her fashion design projects without having to worry about anything.
[95:25.65]Still pretty irritated.
[95:27.39]So I think I'm going to try a cup of that relaxation tea now.
[95:37.51]simple wastebasket that's full of crumpled up tissues soiled with who knows what nothing in there buried among the towels and clothing in the drawer you find some batteries that might come in handy good okay you get uneasy looking at your reflection which seems to distort your features in the lower line of the room
[96:04.12]Can't do anything.
[96:05.39]There's a box.
[96:06.61]Try to open the jewelry box but it seems to be locked.
[96:10.11]Use the tweezers to open the box.
[96:15.17]Nope.
[96:16.74]Use the spoon and smash the box.
[96:21.58]No.
[96:28.66]This looks like the WarioWare bedroom.
[96:32.70]You open the standing closet, a single hook is hanging on the door.
[96:35.37]Oh my god, blood.
[96:38.15]Got the hook.
[96:40.37]Scratches and strange dark stains are spattered throughout the inside of the closet.
[96:47.78]Decorative houseplant that died some time ago.
[96:49.60]The leaves that remain clung to it are dry and brittle.
[96:55.27]Oh, hey, at one hour and 25 minutes into the stream, there's the timestamp.
[96:59.93]This is like the thing you can open up and kind of get like comfortable and maybe fall asleep too.
[97:05.08]It's like a point and click kind of spooky game with like escape room stuff.
[97:09.98]Ah, dude, I fell asleep to that the other night.
[97:11.70]It was pretty good.
[97:14.72]You open the draw and notice various reading material.
[97:18.90]Among them is a page that looks like it was torn out of a journal.
[97:22.20]Hmm.
[97:27.64]Can I read it?
[97:28.06]Is it this one?
[97:29.82]Oh, shit.
[97:30.26]Is this page five?
[97:34.78]I spent the past few days sick and in bed with some kind of flu.
[97:38.91]Headache, nausea, etc.
[97:40.91]Today, I was finally able to hold down some solid food.
[97:43.79]Funnily enough, my symptoms seemed to disappear the moment I had some of that tea that my therapist gave me.
[97:49.09]She didn't mention anything about it being a fly cure, a flu cure, but I'd like to believe that it helped.
[97:56.88]It's human bones.
[97:58.34]It's boiled human bones.
[98:01.48]The sustenance.
[98:02.86]The taste.
[98:03.46]It's now in your head forever.
[98:05.42]You must eat it.
[98:08.06]You must have it.
[98:08.70]Okay, I got batteries.
[98:12.53]Can I open this?
[98:14.23]No.
[98:17.01]Turn the switch, but the lamp stays off.
[98:21.91]Search through the plant.
[98:22.55]Reveals nothing.
[98:23.23]Okay, I think I got everything.
[98:25.31]Mushrooms?
[98:34.47]This one is caved in.
[98:37.05]This door was completely jammed with bags of garbage and broken furniture.
[98:40.13]The smell is terrible.
[98:48.47]Oh, these garbage bags are mostly filled with spoiled food, wrappers, and old clothes.
[98:52.00]That doesn't seem to be anything useful.
[98:55.13]There's no way to open the stand.
[98:56.33]What looks like a drawer is just a decorative, decorative knob.
[98:59.55]A framed portrait of a woman in flowing gown.
[99:05.28]Okay.
[99:10.50]The spacious living room might have been a cozy place to relax if you had come to this house on better terms.
[99:18.59]Whatever that thing in the fireplace is, it's too big and heavy to be carried around.
[99:25.31]Despite your efforts, nothing happens.
[99:26.71]What is it?
[99:27.21]Astray?
[99:28.19]Wait, what's that?
[99:30.07]Oh, journal entry one.
[99:30.99]My therapist suggested that I keep a journal to write down anything that causes me stress, whether it's a minor annoyance or major one.
[99:42.20]She said it would be an excellent tool to identify and manage daily stressors.
[99:46.32]She also sent me home with a tea that is said to promote relaxation.
[99:49.86]What do I have to lose?
[99:50.82]So here's my first journal entry.
[99:54.28]I thought about having one of these.
[99:55.38]You know, that makes sense.
[99:57.36]Like, if I were to have one of these, I don't think I would ever stop writing.
[100:02.82]I would, I would have to be, they would have to be a fucking stenographer with me all day.
[100:09.97]That would, that would, they would, typing would never cease.
[100:15.65]I would have to hire somebody.
[100:27.88]Okay, I got matches.
[100:29.10]Should I light the fire?
[100:29.73]Let's do it.
[100:30.13]Crumpled up note?
[100:31.93]No?
[100:32.05]Not batteries, right?
[100:33.81]No.
[100:54.10]I might need gas.
[100:56.38]Turning on the TV briefly illuminates the room with a hissing static screen before the TV flashes with a pop and goes back off.
[101:06.02]Batteries for the TV?
[101:10.36]How many AA batteries would it take to power a current LED screen?
[101:18.18]You move the couch cushions away to reveal a few coins among the balls of lint.
[101:23.08]Ooh.
[101:23.22]Okay.
[101:26.42]Large painting of a beautiful landscape.
[101:29.42]Nothing behind the... Nothing under the table.
[101:34.72]Windows don't budge.
[101:35.62]Ooh, wait a minute.
[101:39.10]A portrait of a couple and their children.
[101:41.19]They seem happy.
[101:41.89]Okay.
[101:47.71]Can I like... I can probably peel it away or something.
[101:51.14]You flip the picture frame over and see the pills family.
[101:54.92]1986 written on the back.
[102:01.77]Don't burn it.
[102:03.77]Use the hook.
[102:04.51]Doesn't open it.
[102:05.09]Tweezers or something.
[102:09.13]Peel it back.
[102:09.67]I don't think I can do anything with this yet.
[102:19.53]Okay.
[102:19.63]Okay.
[102:24.08]look at this and try not to laugh okay I will okay I I see where you're going with it but no I'm I think I'm good nothing thick vines on the other side of the door have jammed it shut
[102:54.60]Let me go back out.
[102:55.26]Make sure I did everything here.
[102:58.62]I could go up the stairs, but we're going to go to the other side here.
[103:07.46]Ceiling of this expansive foyer reaches all the way to the second floor of the house.
[103:12.91]Twin staircase leading there.
[103:17.97]You run your hands along the grandfather clock, but aside from a small hole in the front, you find nothing.
[103:24.36]Small hole.
[103:28.54]Bench in an end table with a small plant.
[103:30.39]Decorate this little nook.
[103:33.63]Nothing.
[103:35.19]This is the other side of that.
[103:40.40]Go this way.
[103:40.92]Okay, so that's this side.
[103:43.40]So I could go left or up.
[103:47.82]Let's go left.
[103:53.46]Find wooden table surrounded by six chairs is at the center of this lavish dining room.
[103:59.65]China cabinet is tightly sealed and you don't even see a way to open it.
[104:02.39]Another journal entry.
[104:09.86]Journal four.
[104:13.10]Today I was in the sunroom enjoying a cup of that tea.
[104:16.20]It has a unique musky aroma that's really starting to grow on me.
[104:19.80]Sadly, my peace ended when I noticed that the kids had gotten handprints all over the glass.
[104:25.46]You can only afford to have the housekeeper here once a week now.
[104:29.00]So I guess I'm the one who's stuck with cleaning it up.
[104:31.88]Once a week?
[104:36.05]Damn.
[104:40.85]Nothing in the plants.
[104:44.55]Nothing in the plant.
[104:45.23]What about this candle?
[104:48.15]You have no use for the candelabra.
[104:50.14]Are you sure?
[104:53.40]I get to give a use.
[105:00.56]You like the candles with the matches.
[105:03.77]The flames of the candles go out the moment the candelabra is moved.
[105:10.15]So, should I just keep it on?
[105:15.69]Despite your efforts, nothing happens.
[105:16.83]There's like blood all over this.
[105:17.90]Oh no, it's art.
[105:23.50]Oh shit, the candle.
[105:27.88]Can I move any of the chairs?
[105:28.92]No.
[105:31.88]Okay, let's keep going.
[105:38.30]Oh god.
[105:39.94]As you step into the kitchen, the first thing you notice is the foul smell, but then you realize there's someone else here with you.
[105:53.61]You feel uncomfortable doing that while the figure is standing there.
[105:57.90]Fuck, that scared me.
[106:03.54]Did I throw a battery at him?
[106:10.92]You don't want to throw the hook on him?
[106:12.39]Wait, there's a knife.
[106:14.59]Your hand trembles as you slowly reach for the knife.
[106:18.27]He turns around and suddenly raises a very large cleaver in his hand.
[106:22.01]You begin to tremble in fear.
[106:24.09]Did you really think a match is going to... He's not an insect.
[106:37.07]He's not like a bug.
[106:38.91]Or... Okay, what do I do?
[106:39.99]What do I do?
[106:42.53]I gotta run.
[106:53.36]With your heart pounding in your chest, you duck behind the curtains and cover your mouth, hoping to hide.
[106:57.46]What?
[107:02.12]Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
[107:03.46]What are we doing?
[107:04.86]Somehow you must have given yourself away.
[107:06.96]What?
[107:15.52]You wake up back at...
[107:18.13]Oh, was it just a nightmare?
[107:19.45]Okay, what was that little mini game?
[107:24.03]What the hell was that?
[107:25.07]I wonder if he's still there.
[107:34.12]Okay, he's gone.
[107:47.15]I have a knife now.
[107:49.11]Open all this shit up.
[107:51.21]Common dinnerware, plates, cups, glasses, nothing in particular.
[107:57.15]Surface of the countertop is dirty and littered with what appears to be dried blood, human hair, and pieces of rotten flesh.
[108:02.20]Oh my god.
[108:06.64]Rotten stench in the trash.
[108:10.48]Dishwasher, there's nothing.
[108:13.89]Cleaning supplies, large bottle of drain cleaner.
[108:21.26]Aside from some crusty silverware, there's an empty jar of mold?
[108:24.26]Dock?
[108:25.30]Tea?
[108:25.66]That smells pungent.
[108:26.60]You decide to leave it there.
[108:32.13]Nothing in the cabinets.
[108:34.51]Nothing in the cabinets.
[108:36.35]You turn the sink's knobs and hear the sound of pipes banging, but no water comes out.
[108:43.25]Fridge.
[108:43.51]Refrigerator's filled with cans of dog food and rotting meat.
[108:51.03]okay here's the thing I know it's a trope that oh my god the crazy murderer he's eating dog food he keeps cat food in the fridge I don't I don't understand I don't that's not gonna happen to me right like when there's never a time where I'm gonna eat dog food out of the can right I'm still gonna want like buffalo chicken I think do you know what I mean
[109:19.59]There's never a time where I'm going to eat cat food out of the can.
[109:23.03]Maybe if it was like an apocalyptic scenario.
[109:26.01]If the apocalypse happens, okay.
[109:29.19]Let's ration the cat food.
[109:31.99]But there's not a single time in a fairly normal world where I'm eating dog food or cat food.
[109:43.74]Are you the murderer?
[109:44.60]No, I'm just saying like...
[109:47.00]Like, who eats fucking cat food out of the fridge?
[109:54.23]I'm still gonna... I'm still gonna want a ham sandwich.
[110:05.20]Today I was outside enjoying my tea.
[110:07.82]Well, maybe the tea is like... Oh, the tea is fucking up your brain and making you want to crave dog food.
[110:18.10]You would kill for a ham sandwich, is that what you're saying?
[110:24.47]Birdseed Andy?
[110:25.49]I'm not eating birdseed either.
[110:29.53]Okay.
[110:30.75]I don't think... This is what I don't understand.
[110:34.61]Someone's taste for flesh is never going to supersede the taste of Coca-Cola to me.
[110:40.66]Ever.
[110:43.19]That's never going to cross like Fettuccine Alfredo.
[110:45.99]It just isn't.
[110:47.09]It never will.
[110:48.21]Fettuccine Alfredo is still way better.
[110:52.56]It's always going to be.
[110:55.30]I don't understand how, you know, the trope of like, oh, the killer, he wants to eat human meat and he wants to eat dog food.
[111:02.64]Oh, the Coca-Cola, the taste of Coca-Cola is too strong.
[111:15.44]This dude eats dog treats.
[111:16.66]Don't listen to him.
[111:17.30]I don't eat dog treats.
[111:27.40]I'm leaving.
[111:29.30]Whatever.
[111:30.40]Alright.
[111:30.60]Today I was outside enjoying my tea when one of the landscapers bumped into my cup and spilled it on the ground.
[111:36.31]To my surprise, Baxter ran over and started licking up the puddle immediately.
[111:40.09]Instead of being mad, I just laughed.
[111:41.49]Who knew dogs liked tea?
[111:49.92]Wait, the dog ate it too.
[111:52.96]That means the dog now has a taste for dog food.
[111:56.36]The dog's going to be eating dog food cans out of the fridge.
[111:59.96]What the?
[112:00.92]Holy, this is fucked up.
[112:09.93]Nothing in the cabinets.
[112:12.35]What about the oven?
[112:14.85]Charred remains of a turkey.
[112:16.15]At least you hope that's what it is.
[112:25.13]Can I go out this door?
[112:27.33]No.
[112:27.43]Alright, well, I am going to go this way.
[112:32.56]The air in this dusty garage is a bouquet of mildew and motor oil.
[112:36.74]A single light bulb casts the room in a yellow glow.
[112:38.98]I can't take the light.
[112:42.79]Flashlight.
[112:45.21]Flashlight.
[112:45.85]Batteries for the flashlight.
[112:47.37]Guaranteed.
[112:53.84]You use the flashlight on the batteries, but nothing happens.
[112:56.02]Wait, other way around.
[112:57.76]Use the batteries on the flashlight.
[113:02.69]Yeah, you put the batteries in the flashlight and try turning it on.
[113:05.13]To your delight, the flashlight shines brightly.
[113:13.15]Oil can.
[113:16.01]Rusted shut.
[113:16.59]Can I break it open with a spoon?
[113:23.30]What about oil to make it easier to open?
[113:26.37]The oil dissolves the rust and the box springs open.
[113:28.55]Inside the box is a red gas can and a crowbar.
[113:31.49]Let's go.
[113:35.99]Crowbar on the car.
[113:38.14]Car door.
[113:42.50]Oh, I could try just open... Okay, I could try opening it.
[113:45.80]It's locked.
[113:49.41]Can't open the car.
[113:52.64]Fix the garage door opener.
[113:53.94]Okay, if I had the right tools, I could fix the garage door opener.
[114:01.37]Duct tape.
[114:05.65]Journal entry 8.
[114:15.41]Baxter has been vomiting to the point of dry heaving all day.
[114:17.91]He won't eat or drink anything.
[114:19.77]The kids are very upset and Cheryl won't stop blaming me because she thinks it was my tea that made him sick.
[114:25.28]Unbelievable.
[114:26.62]Unfortunately, our personal vet is out of town and all the others are closed.
[114:31.06]So we'll have to wait until tomorrow morning.
[114:38.41]Picking through the trash, you find only junk and ow, you've cut yourself on a piece of rusty scrap metal.
[114:45.73]Do I have to duct tape it?
[114:50.61]Okay, I can't get in the car.
[114:54.80]I need a car key.
[114:58.52]Or some way to get in there.
[114:59.84]I have coins.
[115:00.82]I have drain fluid.
[115:03.96]Okay, I'm going to go back.
[115:10.63]Back again.
[115:11.27]I'm going to use the...
[115:17.13]I'm gonna try to unclog the drain in the bathroom.
[115:25.65]Oh, oops.
[115:38.41]I thought that was the guy.
[115:39.17]I was like, oh shit.
[115:43.10]You empty the contents of the drain cleaner into the sink.
[115:45.06]Moments later, the foul water is sucked down the drain.
[115:48.94]You try to take the shiny object out of the drain, but your fingers are just too big to fit into the opening.
[115:53.73]Tweezers.
[116:02.01]Using the tweezers, you adroitly pluck a silver key from the drain, but lose the tweezers down the drain in the process.
[116:08.79]Okay, is there a locked door?
[116:13.62]Wait, how do I get this ring?
[116:14.66]Maybe we should cut the finger off?
[116:21.90]The edge of the knife keeps slipping off the hand.
[116:30.20]Crowbar, just whack the hand?
[116:35.49]Gas.
[116:38.85]Okay.
[116:41.03]There was something locked in here.
[116:44.73]early on.
[116:45.85]Oh, that actually fucking scared me.
[116:48.99]God damn it.
[116:51.77]Ow.
[116:55.61]Stab him.
[116:56.87]You strike him with the knife.
[116:58.04]Your attack caused him to stumble, but only briefly.
[117:03.24]No, get me out of here.
[117:04.22]Leave.
[117:13.68]uh okay I don't understand this mini game you duck behind the car what's going on in this mini game do I have to wait I had like a little x on the screen it's just timed time the press just time the press okay but I have like an indicator on the screen
[117:46.39]This is a little lock game at Dave and Buster's and I can beat that.
[117:56.73]That was actually pretty hard.
[118:03.54]Okay.
[118:06.82]So let me try to go back.
[118:08.06]What did I, did I, did I get everything from here?
[118:15.66]Okay, I got the key.
[118:21.70]Okay.
[118:22.64]Wait a minute.
[118:25.49]Locked.
[118:26.37]There it is.
[118:26.75]The silver key fits perfectly into the jewelry box and opens it with a click.
[118:37.63]Inside is a single brass key.
[118:40.93]Brass key now.
[118:42.23]Alright, there's another locked thing.
[118:49.23]Is the stream description legally binding?
[118:50.79]Because 7% is fine by me.
[118:52.13]Yeah, that's gross revenue.
[118:53.64]I want gross revenue.
[119:00.00]That's non-negotiable for me.
[119:08.93]Disgusting revenue.
[119:14.99]Okay, this is... Is this for this?
[119:18.78]Shit, no, it's not.
[119:25.50]Okay.
[119:27.81]Yeah, the grandfather clock had a slot in it.
[119:34.45]Yes!
[119:34.93]You insert the key into the clock's face and turn it to a series of satisfying clicks.
[119:39.25]The clock chimes briefly, but makes an unusual grinding sound followed by a loud snap.
[119:45.38]Something drops and rolls out from under the clock.
[119:47.28]What is it?
[119:49.61]gear.
[119:51.27]Okay, stab him.
[119:56.25]Okay, drop oil on the ground and Mario Kart his ass.
[120:02.34]Strike him with the knife.
[120:03.00]Something's blocking the front.
[120:07.04]Oh, fuck.
[120:17.48]Oh shit!
[120:18.44]He's run- I ran right back into him!
[120:34.19]I Scooby-Doo'd myself.
[120:35.41]I Scooby-Doo'd myself.
[120:44.48]I have a feeling I can't fuck that up again.
[120:50.01]So what do I use the gear for?
[120:51.50]Okay, let's go up the stairs.
[121:00.24]I can't go up the stairs?
[121:04.02]Without being able to see through the darkness, you won't... Your flashlight chases away the darkness, revealing a central archway and two wooden doors.
[121:14.28]Let's go on this one.
[121:20.68]This cozy lounge is decorated with trophies and might be a nice place to relax under a different circumstance.
[121:26.84]Oh, that's creepy.
[121:32.26]Journal entry.
[121:35.23]Entry 10.
[121:41.98]one of the landscapers showed me something unusual today he pointed out a patch of strange tendrils that were growing up the ground where I buried baxter two weeks ago I have no idea what they were but I noticed a pungent and familiar smell it smelled like the tea press some buttons on the jukebox but there's no response true to its coin operated feature oh interesting
[122:16.57]Couch cushions, no.
[122:19.49]Running the TV on briefly illuminates the room with a hissing static screen before the flash of TV pop goes off.
[122:24.05]Okay, there's a pool cue over there.
[122:25.83]Okay, I'm going to smash him with the pool cue.
[122:36.42]You strike him with the pool cue.
[122:38.72]Okay, so I need to run.
[122:40.62]Where do I run, though?
[122:43.86]Oh.
[122:45.38]We're good.
[122:51.89]Alright.
[122:53.12]Pool cue and then there's this.
[122:55.24]Stiff coarse fur feels cold to the touch.
[122:57.00]Whatever life this once had is now gone.
[122:58.94]Alright, let's turn the jukebox on.
[123:04.04]You insert some coins into the jukebox as a sentimental song begins to play.
[123:08.47]A sheet of paper falls from underneath.
[123:09.99]Okay.
[123:19.49]Sheet music.
[123:26.68]Oh, he swapped away my... I'm dead.
[123:37.52]Okay.
[123:39.18]Okay, okay, okay.
[123:41.67]Sheep music.
[123:46.71]Use the sheep music on what?
[123:48.45]Okay, there's probably gonna be like a piano or something soon.
[123:53.92]You get infinite chances.
[123:55.84]I'm imagining it's probably scores you on time or you get to die like five times.
[124:04.59]I'm sure we're going to find out.
[124:15.22]Was there anything else I needed to do in there?
[124:16.56]I don't think so.
[124:17.20]So let's not get the potential to get caught again.
[124:21.12]Posters in small, identical beds indicate that this is a bedroom for two young children.
[124:28.43]Try to open the music box, but it's held shut by some locking mechanism.
[124:31.75]You notice a small hole on the side of the music box.
[124:35.60]Or a pool cue.
[124:41.90]Gear?
[124:42.16]How big is this?
[124:45.42]No.
[124:47.79]Teddy bear squeezed to be sure it's not hiding anything.
[124:49.79]It's not.
[124:51.51]Despite how tired you feel, it's not time for a rest.
[124:57.87]Look through the dresser.
[124:58.55]You find odd toy among children's clothing, but nothing that looks like it would be useful.
[125:05.09]Nothing.
[125:05.63]This is an alarm clock.
[125:07.79]Lamp.
[125:09.21]Boards.
[125:11.31]Dollhouse is too big to carry around and there's nothing inside of it that seems like it would be useful.
[125:17.80]Toys.
[125:19.60]Nothing.
[125:22.01]Lights switch up and down.
[125:23.00]Nothing happens.
[125:25.52]Journal entry 13.
[125:33.50]Worst fight with my wife in a long time.
[125:35.20]Yesterday the kids were playing in the yard where the dog was buried.
[125:38.56]Today they are very sick.
[125:40.26]Wife blames me.
[125:41.70]Saying I should have taken care of the stuff that was growing under the tree.
[125:45.91]That it made them sick.
[125:46.93]I know the tea will help them so I will make some for them to drink.
[125:51.63]He's going to show up right now.
[125:56.80]I don't know what to use on that to open it.
[125:58.36]The layout of this hallway is similar to the one on the first floor, except for the total darkness.
[126:07.77]Watch your step.
[126:12.09]Is this pre-recorded?
[126:16.58]Not up.
[126:18.21]Behind the picture is nothing but cobwebs.
[126:21.79]Cobwebs.
[126:24.11]Cobwebs.
[126:26.75]Cobwebs.
[126:30.07]Out of reach.
[126:30.74]The lamp is out of reach.
[126:33.88]Latch to open the gate to go to the backyard.
[126:38.08]Oh, shit.
[126:38.72]Nice.
[126:39.00]Okay.
[126:39.90]So where's a good hiding spot?
[126:40.96]Because now I can go through there now.
[126:45.41]If I get caught against her, I run to the bathroom?
[126:50.19]Acknowledge what?
[126:51.05]Did I miss something?
[126:54.15]I think I missed something.
[126:54.79]What did I miss?
[126:59.20]Did I miss something?
[127:04.02]Oh my god, there was a raid?
[127:06.56]Who raided?
[127:07.00]Somebody raided with 15,000 people?
[127:09.70]Who raided?
[127:21.39]I'm seeing it.
[127:21.97]I'm seeing it.
[127:22.57]It's Pirate Software.
[127:23.41]Oh shit.
[127:23.85]What's up Pirate Software?
[127:24.73]Thanks for the raid.
[127:30.55]Welcome everybody from Pirate Software.
[127:35.88]Mr. Pirate Software himself.
[127:39.54]They all left.
[127:40.28]Am I like 10 minutes too late?
[127:49.24]Did this happen like 25 minutes ago?
[127:54.71]Tell Pirate's Offer about your game.
[127:56.99]That's right.
[127:58.25]Alright.
[127:59.01]Dude, if you're watching, I got a great idea for a game.
[128:03.55]Just telling you.
[128:06.73]All I want is 7% of gross revenue and full rights to all... Hold on.
[128:15.32]I need to hit this guy with something.
[128:22.10]Head over to the pool queue.
[128:32.49]I hope I didn't lose a life.
[128:34.31]Do you even have lives?
[128:39.05]Well, I know none of you do.
[128:43.68]But I'm asking.
[128:54.34]What'd that say?
[128:55.82]No, but thanks for the raid, dude.
[128:56.56]Appreciate it.
[128:57.25]Welcome, everybody.
[128:57.75]That's a big raid.
[128:58.93]We're playing UFO 50, the giant game compilation where it pretends to be from the 80s.
[129:04.71]I would say it's a fantastic experience so far.
[129:08.45]Get it.
[129:10.39]Thanks for the raid.
[129:10.83]Welcome.
[129:15.28]Okay.
[129:17.28]There's no keyhole.
[129:22.15]There's an eeriness about the pitch black playroom.
[129:25.21]Once a place of merriment, as evidenced by the many toys.
[129:30.65]You can't do anything with that.
[129:31.79]Uh, can I grab one of these?
[129:36.21]Like, crayon or something?
[129:41.72]Gentle push jerks the rocking horse into an erratic motion that winds.
[129:46.82]Solar system.
[129:47.52]Nothing.
[129:49.02]Nothing.
[129:51.43]Light doesn't work.
[129:53.61]Ooh, what's that?
[129:55.65]Uh-oh.
[130:04.33]Wife said kids seem worse.
[130:06.63]She begs me to take them to doctor.
[130:09.50]She is wrong.
[130:11.48]She is always wrong.
[130:14.02]I know they will be fine.
[130:15.12]I will give them tea.
[130:17.14]They will get better.
[130:25.35]How much is the toy box?
[130:26.49]There's nothing there.
[130:29.19]You take the doll.
[130:30.05]Oh god.
[130:34.94]Nothing else in here.
[130:37.08]Doesn't seem like it.
[130:40.88]That door is open now.
[130:42.48]That door wasn't open before.
[130:47.02]Oh, I opened it.
[130:52.12]Doll in the dollhouse?
[130:56.13]Shit.
[131:03.78]Okay, what do I do?
[131:04.70]I have tape.
[131:06.22]I got a doll.
[131:07.28]This doesn't open.
[131:12.86]I can't go back here.
[131:22.19]Was this here before?
[131:32.90]fireplace oh gas in the fireplace okay cool turn the fire on the object immediately bursts into flames after a few minutes of burning it's reduced to a pile of ash you take the brilliant red gemstone from the ashes in the fireplace it's a ruby where does that go
[131:58.74]Something missing like an eye or something.
[132:12.73]Maybe I could be able to put on the corpse.
[132:17.00]That makes... I think I have a lot of things to use on the corpse now.
[132:20.74]I'll try it.
[132:28.27]Use the ruby on it, nothing happens.
[132:29.69]No.
[132:33.47]Can I just like duct tape it off?
[132:35.83]No.
[132:37.69]Doll on... No.
[132:41.09]Maybe the hook?
[132:45.37]Use the hook on it, but nothing happens.
[132:48.14]I can't carve it off.
[132:52.80]I have this gear.
[132:53.58]What does this gear do?
[132:54.44]What about oil?
[132:55.20]Can I put oil on it?
[132:58.82]No.
[133:06.18]I'm going to see him again.
[133:07.01]I'm going to have to run.
[133:14.09]Cover yourself in oil.
[133:16.53]Decorative knob.
[133:17.87]There's definitely a spot for this gem.
[133:24.98]Nothing in here.
[133:34.86]TV.
[133:37.96]Oh, fuck.
[133:38.36]Uh-oh.
[133:38.98]Can I hide under the bed?
[133:50.70]I'm good.
[134:06.69]You duck behind the large bear and cover your mouth.
[134:35.89]Jesus Christ, that's fucking hard.
[134:42.03]Shit.
[134:45.95]Okay.
[134:59.51]I need a place for the doll, a place for the gem.
[135:08.03]Okay, there's got to be something in here.
[135:10.29]There's nothing even in here.
[135:11.15]This box.
[135:13.33]Small hole on the side.
[135:14.63]No.
[135:23.78]I still haven't found anything to do with the spoon yet, which is crazy.
[135:33.97]Music sheet?
[135:37.13]That makes sense, but it's a small hole.
[135:38.99]I probably have to use the music sheet on it when it opens.
[135:45.47]Small hole on the side.
[135:46.73]The hook?
[135:48.93]No.
[135:58.21]Locked from the inside.
[135:59.27]Bear.
[136:03.47]I can hide behind the bear.
[136:06.59]Cat.
[136:08.65]Okay, this is teaching me something.
[136:11.37]Up, left, up, right, right, up, left.
[136:18.01]Up, left, up, right, right, up, left.
[136:20.85]I wonder what that's for.
[136:23.25]I think that that's it though.
[136:35.00]There aren't even batteries in it.
[136:36.78]Wait.
[136:40.13]Can I take like the batteries out of this and put it in here?
[136:41.77]What about shining the flashlight on this?
[136:50.31]Something was drawn on the wall here with red and blue crayon.
[136:52.55]It looks like a jumbled mess.
[137:02.80]I don't know.
[137:09.53]I'm kind of running out of places to go.
[137:25.94]Oil plus spoon.
[137:27.14]Eat.
[137:27.32]Oh, wait a minute.
[137:31.01]Tightly sealed?
[137:31.87]There's no way to open it.
[137:32.71]No...
[137:46.60]Put the bowl on the table.
[137:50.94]Oil in bowl.
[137:54.76]Uh... Eat candle.
[138:05.23]Crowbar on... Yes!
[138:07.39]Okay.
[138:10.81]You take the ornamental egg.
[138:13.92]What is this?
[138:14.86]Oh my goodness.
[138:15.58]What the fuck is this for?
[138:16.46]Oh fuck.
[138:24.65]Oh my god.
[138:25.51]Click it.
[138:31.57]Okay.
[138:38.49]Don't screw this up again.
[139:05.26]Oh my goodness, okay.
[139:12.44]So, draw egg.
[139:14.96]Ornamental egg.
[139:18.34]An intricately crafted ornamental egg.
[139:20.31]Giving it a shake reveals a rattle inside.
[139:23.49]But the egg itself seems to be completely sealed.
[139:26.29]Open this with like a knife or something?
[139:28.09]Can I crack it open?
[139:33.75]No.
[139:34.09]Crowbar on the egg?
[139:35.87]No.
[139:37.90]Hook on the egg?
[139:38.54]No.
[139:46.26]What do I do with that?
[139:54.76]Egg.
[140:02.23]Let me go back to the garage.
[140:04.21]Wait, what about... No... Where is the garage?
[140:21.17]Something I can do with this now?
[140:22.21]Like, what if I hold the egg up in front of the picture?
[140:27.28]A gem?
[140:28.52]No.
[140:32.90]Oil on the picture or something?
[140:34.70]I'm gonna go to the kitchen.
[140:49.49]Where's the kitchen?
[140:53.97]Bathroom.
[140:54.47]Fundamental egg on ring?
[140:59.12]No.
[141:02.80]This is the bedroom.
[141:14.50]Where is the kitchen?
[141:19.53]Nothing in here to do?
[141:20.53]I don't think so.
[141:24.48]Okay.
[141:27.76]Is there nothing else I can do in the kitchen?
[141:31.36]Whoa, this is different.
[141:37.17]The backyard.
[141:39.49]This was locked before, wasn't it?
[141:41.77]It's too far away to reach.
[141:47.20]It's a very cold night and you'd rather not jump into the water.
[141:56.39]Oh dear.
[141:57.49]Four stone lion statues molted with moss and lichen stand like sentinels in front of a dark, foreboding gate of oxidized copper.
[142:08.69]Tracing your fingers along the lion statue, you notice that its mouth is unusually hollow as if to hold something.
[142:14.53]Well... You try to put the ruby into the first lion's mouth, but it doesn't fit.
[142:22.10]What about... Okay.
[142:24.14]You want to put the ruby into the second lion's mouth and it fits perfectly.
[142:29.66]The egg, maybe?
[142:40.76]No.
[142:40.90]I think I'm going to need to find more gems.
[142:46.09]There's probably a gem inside of the egg.
[142:53.77]In the stillness of the night, small critters can be heard rustling through the overgrown grass of this unkempt backyard.
[143:00.42]Alright, I feel like I'm going to be able to use a lot of stuff here.
[143:03.70]The lawnmower is too heavy to carry around and any part that might be useful is held firmly by bolts.
[143:12.32]What about the shed?
[143:14.94]Door is locked.
[143:19.28]Can of oil in the lawnmower.
[143:25.69]No.
[143:29.04]A heavy iron padlock is keeping it locked.
[143:37.14]Try to pry the lock off.
[143:38.19]It doesn't budge.
[143:39.31]So you smash it with the crowbar and it still doesn't yield.
[143:41.81]What about this door?
[143:46.01]Not enough space to pry it.
[143:47.03]Okay.
[143:59.36]The side area of the house is comparatively smaller than the backyard.
[144:02.74]It looks like it was once used as a flower garden.
[144:07.31]The dirt is packed tightly here and you can't seem to break the ground with your bare hands.
[144:10.61]Okay, well, let's dig.
[144:15.43]Crowbar on the dirt, but nothing happens.
[144:17.79]No.
[144:19.52]I need a shovel.
[144:27.48]That's where the... Oh, this is where the dog is.
[144:29.16]Spoon?
[144:30.50]Oh, this is... Oh, no.
[144:32.56]What about this tree?
[144:36.52]You pick a cherry from the tree and notice that it's completely covered in mold.
[144:39.56]You quickly discard it.
[144:40.56]Okay.
[144:46.47]The greenhouse?
[144:48.09]Plants that once decorated this sunroom have grown to cover almost every interior surface.
[144:53.37]The aroma of vegetation is overwhelming.
[145:00.47]lamp journal entry nine baxter did not make it through the night I just finished burying him under the cherry tree his favorite spot to sleep charlie and becky are beside themselves with sadness poor baxter okay these vines here I can probably get rid of them
[145:29.34]Use the hook on the metal bon- no, on the one on the vines.
[145:36.39]I cut them with the knife?
[145:38.43]Can't find a good angle of the knife to cut through the vines.
[145:40.45]What?
[145:45.33]What are you talking about?
[145:46.11]Nothing happens.
[145:52.84]Nothing.
[145:56.51]I think that's the tea.
[145:58.15]You pick up the tea cup to ponder it for a moment before setting it back down.
[146:01.19]Wait a minute, don't I have... Didn't I have, like, some of the tea?
[146:19.19]I don't remember.
[146:19.73]I don't think I can do anything here yet.
[146:26.50]What's in the... There's another... Oh, this is block two.
[146:31.04]You mean to tell me I cannot, like, hack that off with the hook?
[146:36.64]Really?
[146:40.60]Can't find a good angle.
[146:41.36]Okay.
[146:50.43]Okay.
[146:54.04]large imposing house stands before you almost defiantly you love nothing more than to leave its vicinity what's this it seems to be sort of a latch inside the hexagonal opening of this plaque you can't seem to manipulate it crowbar hexagonal opening
[147:23.27]Pool queue?
[147:29.30]Shit.
[147:35.62]Anything else I can do outside here?
[147:43.08]Can you put the pool queue on the hook?
[147:53.60]Wait a minute.
[148:02.02]Dude, I just made a fucking sickle.
[148:07.09]Oh, look what I can do now.
[148:17.65]Yep.
[148:21.27]You pull the object closer to you with the hooked pole.
[148:24.48]It's surprisingly heavy.
[148:25.66]As it gets closer, you realize it's a corpse.
[148:29.20]Your skin crawls as you reach down to remove a copper key from the corpse's belt.
[148:35.02]A rather ordinary looking copper key attached to a keyring and a plastic keychain, but whatever is written on it has worn off.
[148:40.27]What can I do with a copper key?
[148:47.47]It was like a copper door.
[148:56.61]Car.
[148:56.73]There's a couple of things here.
[148:57.73]There's the cellar and then there's the... The key is minuscule in comparison to the... No, okay.
[149:03.31]Maybe this one?
[149:06.21]Yep.
[149:08.23]Let's go in the shed.
[149:08.97]Okay.
[149:14.13]The small confines of this wooden shed feel cramped and claustrophobic.
[149:17.76]Wood dust seems to cover every surface of this tiny space.
[149:23.22]We needed to use that to fix the garage door opener.
[149:27.76]Journal entry.
[149:36.06]No matter how many times we get rid of the tendrils, they keep coming back.
[149:39.36]Some sort of fungus, I'm told.
[149:42.11]A friend gave me a recipe for a treatment that is said to get rid of all manners of mold and fungi by killing it at the root.
[149:48.25]I typed it into my computer so I wouldn't lose it.
[149:50.19]Okay, we gotta go to the computer.
[149:58.29]Can tear that sack open with the knife.
[150:06.11]Slice the sack open with the knife, causing dirt to cascade to the floor.
[150:08.59]There's something in the dirt.
[150:10.85]Bronze key.
[150:11.77]Ooh.
[150:15.34]The vice operates smoothly and could be used to hold or even crush something.
[150:23.85]Put the egg in there.
[150:25.59]Egg bulges and it crushes.
[150:27.15]A gold key falls.
[150:28.41]Alright, we're getting fucking keys.
[150:32.09]Shovel.
[150:33.75]Head shears.
[150:35.89]Wrench.
[150:39.69]You poke the growth and it releases a cloud of dust.
[150:42.27]You begin to choke.
[150:43.79]Oh.
[150:46.01]Okay, we got a lot of items now.
[150:53.62]so much loot yeah well let's see if this opens this one of these what kind of one of these no this one no let's I know this is sad but we're gonna have to do this the shovel pierces the ground with ease not long after you start digging you feel the shovel hit something
[151:26.17]Skeletal remains of what appears to be an animal of some sort.
[151:31.54]You take the steel key.
[151:36.22]Neither dirt nor animal bones will probably be of much use to you right now.
[151:39.50]Okay, another key.
[151:41.52]Is this probably a duck?
[151:48.43]I don't think so.
[151:56.42]Damn, really?
[152:01.08]Okay.
[152:05.08]Maybe I can try to clip it off.
[152:08.90]Can I just snap it off with the shears?
[152:12.62]No.
[152:23.21]Okay, that works.
[152:27.23]Does this work on this too?
[152:28.91]Okay.
[152:30.57]The box is now open.
[152:33.07]Rusty hacksaw.
[152:38.07]Okay, got a lot of items now.
[152:43.29]Oh shit.
[152:45.03]Okay.
[152:47.55]I need to go to the garage.
[152:58.99]Wait.
[153:01.45]Where's the garage?
[153:03.87]There it is.
[153:04.21]Okay.
[153:05.12]Screwdriver.
[153:05.78]On this.
[153:12.44]The garage door mechanism is held together by bolts.
[153:14.22]The screwdriver doesn't seem to be the right tool for the job.
[153:20.00]What?
[153:23.47]What are you talking about?
[153:24.23]French?
[153:25.11]French?
[153:29.21]You're able to open the garage door mechanism using the wrench to discover that it needs a new motor.
[153:35.43]Good luck finding that.
[153:41.45]Use the gear?
[153:42.43]No.
[153:49.23]Yeah, maybe one of the car keys might work.
[153:54.60]Oh, shit.
[153:58.34]You can get that garage door open.
[153:59.76]There's no point in trying to start the car.
[154:01.30]Is there anything in the car?
[154:11.86]You unlock the trunk of the car and open it.
[154:13.96]However, it's empty save for some dark stains.
[154:16.00]You close it.
[154:17.01]Oh, really?
[154:17.45]Okay.
[154:34.09]Any more?
[154:34.51]Okay, I have a lot of keys.
[154:45.70]Wasn't there a locked door up here?
[154:46.90]Okay, small hole.
[154:51.34]Screwdriver?
[154:51.86]No...
[154:58.80]The little key?
[155:00.40]No.
[155:02.99]Gold, bronze key?
[155:05.35]No.
[155:12.33]Grab the bag that was in the pool?
[155:13.79]Was there something else in the pool that I didn't get?
[155:24.56]Locked from inside, but did none of these work?
[155:32.01]Shit.
[155:38.61]Whoa.
[155:42.03]Head's gone.
[155:42.51]Get the engine from the lawnmower.
[155:55.22]That's true, but the only thing is, how do I get the lawn... Maybe the screwdriver on the lawnmower?
[156:09.42]I'll try that.
[156:15.52]I got nothing for this, right?
[156:17.28]I don't think so.
[156:24.08]Wait, should I use the shears on the tree?
[156:25.68]No.
[156:41.81]Okay, get this open.
[156:45.13]Lawnmower is held together by bolts.
[156:46.83]Nope, so we're going to use the wrench.
[156:48.01]Okay.
[156:57.51]Pull the motor out.
[156:58.29]Okay, we got the motor now.
[157:00.33]Let's go put this in.
[157:04.29]One thing at a time.
[157:07.93]I haven't been jumped in a long time.
[157:14.44]It's happening any second here.
[157:15.58]Okay.
[157:25.36]Install the new lawnmower.
[157:30.18]The garage door opens.
[157:33.66]You thrust the car key into the ignition.
[157:35.27]This might be your only chance of getting out of here.
[157:47.23]Oh shit.
[157:50.97]Should I get out of here?
[157:54.69]This is the bad ending?
[157:55.61]Oh no.
[157:58.54]But there are other games I want to play on this list.
[158:00.50]But I'm... I like this one.
[158:01.96]I wish I could save it right here.
[158:12.84]We need the story.
[158:17.54]You can continue after.
[158:18.62]Let's see what happens.
[158:22.88]The tires squeal as you hurtle down the driveway, smashing through the gate.
[158:27.25]Against all odds, you escape.
[158:29.81]The end.
[158:33.95]You had five bad dreams while you were trapped in Night Manor.
[158:42.38]Yeah, so you could try to go through without losing once.
[158:48.44]That was cool.
[158:49.77]And that's just like the... That's the part of the haunted house where the workers have the exit ready to open.
[158:57.97]Maybe a third or halfway through the experience.
[159:01.39]So all the scared kids can leave.
[159:03.97]I know this because I was one of those scared kids and I remember being I remember being I was on I think I was riding on my like I think it was my father's shoulders I was like on his back and I had my face buried into his back eyes were closed every I just wasn't even looking at all and I was just crying and I remember it was like no come this way look this way and we just kind of left
[159:31.55]How old were you?
[159:32.83]I was probably eight.
[159:45.90]This happened three years ago.
[159:55.19]That was last Saturday, dude.
[160:00.87]That was awesome.
[160:03.17]Oh my god, he's still in the car!
[160:05.63]Alright, so if I do continue... Hey, look at that.
[160:16.92]It's all still here.
[160:19.96]Let me see.
[160:20.42]I need to go back to the library.
[160:22.48]Hey, look!
[160:24.46]It counts as a completion.
[160:25.33]I only have two of these beats.
[160:30.83]That's really fun.
[160:31.53]I love it.
[160:32.20]I do want to see the rest of these and maybe I'll go back and finish it.
[160:37.40]That was really cool.
[160:38.66]That one's up there.
[160:39.72]I gotta favorite this one.
[160:42.56]Okay.
[160:47.32]Elphazar's Hat.
[160:59.89]Card game?
[161:02.23]I guess I could read the description, couldn't I?
[161:05.64]Ladies and gentlemen, the great magician Elphazar.
[161:09.70]Yay!
[161:11.08]Maybe we can break free if you can reach the saw.
[161:21.93]Oh, come on, let's get out of here.
[161:30.61]We need to go to the Grand Palace to free our other friends.
[161:34.70]Hubby!
[161:37.94]Let's see how far you make it with my goons after you.
[161:45.94]Stage 1.
[161:48.14]Dash and shoot?
[161:51.09]Holy shit.
[161:53.35]This is Pocky and Rocky.
[161:57.41]One of the greatest Super Nintendo games ever.
[162:01.12]This is Pocky and Rocky.
[162:03.55]I can't believe it.
[162:04.45]I actually cannot believe it.
[162:11.57]That is one of the greatest of all time.
[162:20.49]And you can dash too.
[162:21.55]Is it invincibility frames?
[162:28.19]Extend.
[162:37.10]It even makes similar sound effects to Pocky and Rocky.
[162:49.97]They made a sequel to Pocky and Rocky.
[162:53.19]You know, that's a franchise that I would love to see come back.
[163:00.42]You know, let's bring Pocky and Rocky back.
[163:06.95]It did.
[163:07.27]Oh.
[163:09.33]Was it any good?
[163:12.64]Was it good?
[163:13.10]I didn't... Whoa.
[163:26.75]There was a remaster.
[163:27.81]Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.
[163:39.11]You know what else I'd like to see?
[163:40.13]Smash TV.
[163:44.99]Oh, I drop bombs now when I dash.
[163:58.82]I'd love a Smash TV remake or whatever you want to call it.
[164:02.25]Oh shit, this is bad.
[164:11.36]big money big prizes I love it no way alright boss time oops I thought I had bombs still
[164:50.64]It does have iframes.
[164:55.84]Fuck.
[165:13.08]I like this one a lot.
[165:38.97]I should probably be matching cards, shouldn't I?
[165:41.80]Ooh, slippery.
[165:50.96]Slippery.
[165:57.79]Should I match cards?
[165:58.67]Should I do that?
[166:15.22]yes now we need spider webs three the same is stronger I'll keep that in mind this one's up there I like this one a lot and whatever
[166:52.26]Shit!
[166:53.54]Oh, I like this one too.
[166:56.78]I'm gonna favorite this one.
[167:05.95]Pilot quest.
[167:11.89]I definitely want to see them all first.
[167:14.35]Before I choose which one I want to put a little bit more time into.
[167:19.83]One day?
[167:32.72]I do want to play Party House.
[167:34.86]Because that's the best game on this whole collection.
[167:38.34]ToeJam & Earl?
[167:38.94]Okay, maybe try talking.
[167:45.71]You can call me Tiramisu.
[167:48.99]Oh, you can call me Tiramisu.
[167:53.67]Slard is my name.
[167:54.77]If you want to survive the wild zone, you'll need some meat.
[167:57.49]Yes.
[167:58.31]Get some meat and I'll let you pass, okay?
[168:05.71]This one's cute.
[168:09.93]The moon crystal spins hypnotically.
[168:11.63]Do this forever?
[168:28.07]How many times can I do this?
[168:35.79]What is a good amount of these to own?
[168:48.59]How many of these should I get?
[168:49.47]Is this a currency?
[168:51.27]Okay, I'll stay with 50.
[168:56.24]Build a house for five... You need five more ingots.
[169:02.84]I don't have any ingots, wait.
[169:06.88]50 ingots.
[169:09.60]I'm Parvina, a huntress.
[169:11.04]I need a moon ingot to repair my shack.
[169:15.36]I sell meat.
[169:18.28]I'm the gumma tree.
[169:19.26]If you give me 10 moon drops, I can make a seed for you.
[169:22.70]Oh.
[169:23.54]Okay.
[169:23.76]Let's do it again.
[169:32.83]I need 154 more moon drops?! !
[169:37.20]This is an idle game.
[169:40.36]Isn't it?
[169:45.42]Oh, shit.
[169:47.03]Okay, I'm playing this for the rest of the night.
[169:51.85]You don't give me an idle game.
[169:53.83]I was in the top 5,000 on Family Guy quest for stuff.
[170:00.24]I think I was like, if you went to the leaderboards, I was like user number like 6,500 out of like 7,800 or something.
[170:05.57]I was up there pretty fucking high.
[170:19.38]Oh, I can't.
[170:19.82]I'm going to... Okay.
[170:20.86]We're going to get... We're going to get development first.
[170:24.30]I'm taking 154 over there.
[170:25.92]We're going to max out the seeds because you want to get a baseline of development first.
[170:37.57]There's no way I don't gold this right now.
[170:39.71]Not a single chance in hell.
[170:44.00]If I only beat three of these out of 50, this is going to be one of them.
[170:53.72]It was a 154, right?
[170:57.58]Okay.
[170:57.94]What's the next tier?
[170:58.88]634.
[171:01.98]What else can I do?
[171:08.39]You can use this workbench to turn a thousand moon drops into one moon ingot.
[171:11.85]Okay.
[171:12.99]Not quite there yet.
[171:19.72]What's down here?
[171:22.97]Hello, I'm Dr. Lumen.
[171:24.09]Would you like to see our current research project?
[171:26.15]Yes.
[171:29.03]Metal yo-yo?
[171:29.91]Oh, this is upgrading your yo-yo.
[171:34.35]I'll be back.
[171:37.54]Nothing here.
[171:38.08]Okay.
[171:39.64]Alright.
[171:41.38]Watch out.
[171:47.52]Okay, they despawn, but I think it's more cost-effective just to stand in one spot.
[172:06.64]Yeah!
[172:08.38]This is amazing.
[172:11.32]I feel so accomplished.
[172:22.09]What do I need?
[172:23.03]600?
[172:24.61]Wait, wait, wait.
[172:25.03]Did I see everything already?
[172:28.55]This is to generate.
[172:30.01]I need... I need a moon ingot.
[172:33.57]It's a thousand of these to make one moon ingot.
[172:39.53]What are these for?
[172:41.21]Workbench for five?
[172:42.34]I need five ingots.
[172:49.54]Okay.
[172:49.80]150?
[172:49.90]I don't have enough resources.
[172:52.08]Wait.
[172:52.76]What do you mean I don't have enough resources?
[172:53.96]I have 150.
[172:58.40]What?
[173:03.55]These are ingots?
[173:08.03]Holy shit.
[173:08.57]That's going to take forever.
[173:12.37]The research machine looks like it's missing a gear.
[173:15.75]There's nothing here.
[173:22.13]What do you need?
[173:24.55]You want meat.
[173:25.87]I need, okay.
[173:27.49]I need a thousand.
[173:46.40]A thousand moon drops into one moon ingot.
[173:48.35]Okay, I need one.
[173:49.03]I need a thousand.
[174:03.87]Upgrade the crystal?
[174:04.77]I don't think I can.
[174:08.45]It was 600 for the next one.
[174:19.80]Make another workbench for five.
[174:28.09]I need 5,000.
[174:33.89]Get out of the fucking way.
[174:38.13]Don't tell him.
[174:38.83]Don't tell him.
[174:41.36]Don't tell me what?
[174:42.32]Am I missing something here?
[174:51.66]Stick with it.
[174:52.08]This one's actually really good.
[174:57.10]The game... Oh, it... I can leave and it will generate seeds.
[175:02.84]Okay.
[175:03.64]That's good to know.
[175:05.72]But I ain't leaving.
[175:07.24]Not yet.
[175:13.23]I'll leave when I have max generation.
[175:21.95]It's way faster if you just hit the crystal, though.
[175:23.81]It's true.
[175:39.22]I need a thousand.
[175:44.29]This guy keeps getting in the way.
[175:45.33]How do I just kill this guy?
[176:01.75]Okay, I think it's 10 times before I can... Let's say 1, 2... Yep, I can do it 10 times.
[176:14.70]Oh my god!
[176:15.67]A rare fell out of it.
[176:19.35]A rare just fell out.
[176:21.19]I can just... I can do this now.
[176:24.83]Who needed this?
[176:25.41]You did.
[176:29.51]I need a moon ingot to repair my shack.
[176:32.67]Thank you, stranger.
[176:33.53]I can hunt again.
[176:34.35]Here's a free meat for helping me.
[176:37.63]And then you want the meat.
[176:41.49]Get out of the way.
[176:42.21]Meat won't last forever.
[176:42.93]Come back before it runs out.
[176:44.13]What?
[176:47.83]I have 120 seconds of... Of what?
[176:48.47]What?
[177:08.77]Ooh, meat extension.
[177:09.85]Do I have to investigate everything?
[177:29.55]What can I do with you?
[177:40.98]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[177:44.10]That guy's got a gun.
[177:44.77]How much health do I have?
[177:54.84]You pushed yourself too hard again, didn't you?
[177:56.36]I hope you take better care of yourself.
[177:59.78]You lost everything.
[178:11.79]Wait, what the fuck was the point of this?
[178:32.64]2560?
[178:38.31]So that person generates meat.
[178:53.20]Next game?
[178:54.04]LOL.
[178:54.58]No, not yet.
[179:04.21]You know how much I've dedicated to tapping coins on the screen in random stupid fucking games like this?
[179:16.76]You know how many crates have flown by in the background that I tapped and had to watch two ads to open the crate to get x5 money generation for 10 seconds?
[179:29.93]I was made for this.
[179:45.01]Do you know how many times I prestiged to 100% my generation of the first level item?
[179:55.25]Which adds about times 10 onto every generation.
[180:09.32]Strategy games.
[180:11.32]Oh, I can't dedicate to it.
[180:14.40]Fighting games.
[180:17.38]Collect meaningless resource to collect more meaningless resource to collect even more meaningless resource.
[180:29.93]You got me.
[180:35.93]Number just go up.
[180:38.37]You got me.
[180:41.64]I'm going to get this to max generation and then go to the next game.
[180:51.82]Collect the meat.
[180:53.92]How long does it take to get it?
[180:56.60]Currently out of meat.
[180:57.28]Please come back later.
[180:58.28]How long is it?
[180:58.84]Hey dude, did you watch Oh the Misery Season 2?
[181:07.99]I did not.
[181:09.66]I've only guys I've only seen like two or three episodes of all the misery season one.
[181:36.10]You're a fake fan.
[181:38.79]I'm not a real... Yeah, I'm not a... I'm not a fake fan, nor a real fan.
[181:44.61]Only a Sith operates in absolutes.
[182:09.75]Are you a hater?
[182:10.43]No, I'm just a... I'm just a... I don't give a shitter.
[182:15.85]Is that... I... I just... I don't, like... I just don't care.
[182:22.82]Oh, so you're a hater.
[182:32.68]I don't give a shit about a lot of stuff.
[182:56.21]Nihilism.
[182:57.49]No, I didn't say that either.
[182:58.49]I care about a lot of things.
[183:02.46]It's just... There are many things that I don't necessarily care about.
[183:07.88]You can't... Guys, there's so much media.
[183:11.25]You're never going to watch it all.
[183:15.15]Hey, how does this sound?
[183:16.33]The RNG of your brain chemistry and like how you... What you like.
[183:22.55]You're not going to consume tons of media.
[183:26.28]Think about the RNG, the DNA code in your brain that baked you into you watching the things you watch.
[183:33.14]There are a thousand books you have never read and you never will.
[183:35.89]And other people will, not you.
[183:45.73]Like, you rolled into whatever the character you are and think about all the stuff you're not going to ever see or hear.
[183:53.63]We're all on our own path of exile trees, okay?
[183:56.49]So don't worry.
[184:00.68]Okay, you could be a mage.
[184:02.60]Maybe you're a summoner or something.
[184:20.91]Meat, meat, meat.
[184:22.35]Oh wait, I can do meat?
[184:27.52]There's nothing here.
[184:28.16]There's meat right there!
[184:29.54]Okay.
[184:36.09]So wait, if I go in there with 940, am I going to lose 940?
[184:42.59]That's a meat extension?
[184:43.33]Yeah.
[184:43.47]Alright, I'm going for it again.
[184:54.16]Wait.
[184:54.96]I'm gonna wait for two meats.
[184:57.78]We'll have double meat extension.
[185:03.37]What does it take to do this?
[185:05.89]What's like the next thing in progress?
[185:08.01]Okay, five ingots is a house.
[185:13.45]What about these?
[185:15.77]Resource silo.
[185:21.80]These are way too expensive.
[185:27.65]Okay, now I got two.
[185:29.05]It's five to do the other.
[185:30.13]Okay, I'm gonna go for five.
[185:31.33]Does your brain allow you to enjoy severance?
[185:43.93]I don't know.
[185:58.07]Okay, one more meat and we'll do, what, two minutes up there?
[186:00.55]I'm gonna try not to die.
[186:04.27]Yeah, as you, when you're a kid, from the time that you're an adolescent to an adult, you are using skill points.
[186:19.27]You are leveling shit up on your character.
[186:25.05]Even stuff like, you have a food skill tree.
[186:28.30]Oh, I like gravy.
[186:30.34]Things with gravy.
[186:31.18]I'll put one point in things with gravy on it.
[186:34.62]And by the way, there are five points per food item.
[186:39.00]I have five points in hummus.
[186:45.23]Think of how big that skill tree is.
[186:46.93]It's massive.
[186:51.69]Yeah, life is just a giant roguelike, guys.
[187:05.25]What's your favorite brand?
[187:11.72]Fucking homemade.
[187:13.24]Homemade.
[187:13.72]What do you mean brand?
[187:17.22]It's all homemade.
[187:18.14]I only need stuff that's homemade.
[187:29.33]Wait, you brought it to the store?
[187:30.87]You didn't make it homemade?
[187:33.26]You know it's only like three ingredients, right?
[187:36.02]You know it's only like three ingredients.
[187:39.59]It's not homemade.
[187:42.95]You don't make your own ketchup?
[187:44.29]Why don't you make your own ketchup?
[187:45.19]It's so much better for you and so much better.
[187:47.27]Like, what, you buy ketchup still?
[187:50.49]It's three ingredients.
[187:51.47]You know it's only two ingredients? ...
[188:09.82]Who hurt you?
[188:12.84]This is going in the fucking journal.
[188:16.06]Stenographer!
[188:16.60]Alright, is there another meat?
[188:29.08]Okay.
[188:31.89]I'm going in.
[188:33.91]I got double meat.
[188:34.73]Extension.
[188:40.10]I don't even know what I'm looking for, but I'm looking for whatever it is.
[188:50.69]So do I have to leave, like go out where I came?
[188:53.27]Down there?
[188:53.75]Or does the time just have to run out?
[189:06.61]Yes, I have to leave.
[189:08.37]Okay, okay.
[189:09.57]I gotta remember it's down and to the right.
[189:17.27]Oh, fuck you.
[189:22.44]Oh, fuck both of you.
[189:23.58]How much HP do you have?
[189:27.24]Oh my fucking god, give it to me!
[189:33.42]Fuck!
[189:33.58]I gotta go!
[189:35.16]I gotta go!
[189:36.94]Fuck, no!
[189:40.81]Oh, come on.
[189:46.43]God darn it.
[189:48.52]You gotta be shitting me.
[189:50.48]That's not cool.
[189:51.66]Let's go into the journal.
[190:03.35]I didn't even get greedy.
[190:04.59]I got hit and I had to run.
[190:07.77]But the hitbox was... 50 feet wide.
[190:11.38]Shit.
[190:16.86]No, I have to do it.
[190:18.24]I want to do it.
[190:19.02]I'm not done.
[190:24.61]I don't care if 10,000 of you leave.
[190:30.83]I'm building at least a house of five ingots.
[190:50.35]And I'm going to speedrun next time.
[190:51.33]It's 500 for one meat.
[191:00.38]nice oh thank you rng thank you rngesus what's wrong with you I don't know
[191:29.10]I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck, we don't give a fuck, we don't give a fuck, we don't give a fuck.
[191:49.20]We don't give a fuck, we don't give a fuck, we don't give a fuck, we don't give a fuck.
[191:53.56]Is it me?
[191:57.02]No.
[192:21.80]Why don't you grow up?
[192:24.02]You know, I'm sorry.
[192:24.60]I blame Toys R Us.
[192:27.87]Toys R Us used to run fucking propaganda.
[192:31.45]I don't want to grow up.
[192:32.57]I don't want to grow up and be a Toys R Us kid forever.
[192:35.25]I don't want to grow up.
[192:37.91]I'll always be a Toys R Us kid.
[192:40.04]It fucked me up for life.
[192:52.51]You've reused this bit?
[192:55.97]Guys, it's whatever.
[192:57.21]I've said 700 million words on stream in like 15 years.
[193:06.00]The random number generator that pulls shit out of my brain is going to re-roll the same quest.
[193:10.42]The same daily quest is gonna roll like once.
[193:14.36]In fact, that's kind of remarkable.
[193:17.70]Hey, be happy that it's not the same eight sentences for 15 years.
[193:23.22]Okay, meet.
[193:43.20]Yeah, I'm not going to screw this up.
[193:45.94]Don't mess it up.
[193:46.48]I'm going to speedrun the purple aliens on the left.
[193:50.58]And I'm going to get tons of ingots.
[193:57.13]I'm coming for revenge.
[194:08.76]You don't get mad.
[194:15.00]I can do two swings.
[194:16.32]Three swings.
[194:25.13]Where are the ingots?
[194:25.99]Where are the ingots?
[194:27.23]Oh, I'm going to have to go back.
[194:53.37]I can't do it with one.
[194:54.33]Dude, that guy dropped three ingots the last time.
[194:57.83]That's probably a rare drop.
[194:59.51]I don't wanna grow up.
[195:06.43]I'll be a Toys R Us kid.
[195:08.57]I don't wanna grow up.
[195:09.73]I'll always be a Toys R Us kid.
[195:11.89]Forever.
[195:23.36]I'll always be a starlight kid.
[195:30.12]That's not even mine.
[195:30.78]I stole that one.
[195:35.89]Wait, is it stealing it if I said all those words, but then you just rearrange them to the tune?
[195:44.61]I'd be stealing from me, stealing from you, stealing from me.
[195:48.55]No, I own the rights to it.
[196:04.21]There we go.
[196:04.63]Alright.
[196:05.85]Just one more of those and I'm good.
[196:07.39]And I'll play the next game.
[196:28.28]Yes!
[196:31.20]Oh, the RNG gods were so kind to us today.
[196:36.33]I built a house.
[196:37.25]A friendly alien shows up and claims it for their home.
[196:40.68]Okay.
[196:41.76]What does this do?
[196:44.20]Your friend whistles a cheerful tune.
[196:45.90]It's quite loud.
[196:46.80]Okay.
[196:51.65]Well, what?
[196:54.59]Do you work now?
[196:55.43]Do you come and hit the crystal?
[196:58.11]What does he do?
[197:07.81]What does he do?
[197:17.35]He's a friend.
[197:18.76]Build a workbench.
[197:25.96]Oh, does he work at the workbench?
[197:29.94]Okay, I need five more.
[197:30.79]I'm not leaving yet.
[197:43.61]Am I getting more crystals?
[197:44.79]I don't think I am.
[197:45.83]I'm getting them from the up top here.
[197:50.01]Should I plant?
[197:52.27]No, that's 2,000.
[197:52.81]Way too many.
[197:53.31]Play something else and come back.
[198:03.49]Not when you get RNG like that.
[198:13.21]Come pick these up.
[198:13.85]Will you come pick these up at least?
[198:37.31]What's the candle?
[198:39.76]It's a revolutionary new FPS horror-inspired rogue-like game.
[198:47.68]Where at the end of the game, if you don't complete it, it says your candle is burning.
[198:54.25]And then the game uninstalls itself and you have to buy it again.
[198:58.09]I forgot to say that was part of it.
[199:15.52]No, no, because you have to link your bank account first before the game is allowed to open.
[199:33.59]How much did the game cost?
[199:37.09]Uh, five cents a life.
[199:49.56]And there'd be Steam reviews that had, like, 45 minutes.
[199:55.45]That would just be, like, a meme review of, like, laughing my fucking ass off.
[199:58.97]Fuck the dev.
[200:00.83]I only paid five cents for this.
[200:03.44]And my intention was to make it so you'd lose a shitload of times and pay at least, like, a dollar or two.
[200:08.44]Like, laughing my ass off.
[200:10.08]Dev, fuck this dev.
[200:14.50]Got it in five cents.
[200:17.00]And then like in all capitals would be like, I don't know, they put like a bunch of like fucked up ASCII art or something.
[200:30.55]Mostly negative.
[200:35.10]I thought you were trying to stop swearing.
[200:36.88]Yeah, but we're playing Pilot Quest.
[200:42.14]All bets are off, sorry.
[200:46.04]This is behind the scenes, Jerma, right?
[200:48.26]Yeah, this is behind the scenes, Jeremy.
[200:50.02]I mean, like, all the kids went to bed, you know what I mean?
[200:54.32]I was just, like, talking.
[200:57.57]It's like Jerma, like, after dark, you know what I mean?
[200:59.19]All the kids went to bed.
[201:12.63]It's 6 p.m.
[201:15.85]Not in Australia, where I am.
[201:18.09]It's because I lost my accent when I was younger.
[201:22.90]I moved away for a while and moved back.
[201:27.14]Some woods do it, but not all of them.
[201:29.04]Ah, it just came out.
[201:34.05]Came out a little.
[201:58.87]Is that why the stream is upside down for me?
[202:02.11]That's a good one.
[202:02.61]I like that one.
[202:04.41]That was a good one.
[202:13.66]Isn't it crazy that half the planet right now is standing upside down?
[202:20.32]And then later on tonight, we're going to be standing upside down.
[202:28.28]maybe that's why I have like headaches at night because I'm like I'm like I'm upside down that's not how gravity works what are you what do you mean are you a scientist
[202:56.95]It's called Reverse Gravitational Pole Headache Syndrome, alright?
[203:03.68]But just because... Well, it's not in your fancy medical book.
[203:20.10]Okay, there's probably a second... No, there's not.
[203:25.91]Hahaha.
[203:42.37]RPG... RPGHS affects over 50 million Americans.
[203:50.57]Take Recoveryosa.
[203:52.71]Recoveryosa is a once-daily tablet to fight reverse gravitational pull headache syndrome.
[204:00.75]This once-daily tablet can cut your headaches in half by about 45%.
[204:13.10]Side effects may include positive gravitational force headache syndrome.
[204:18.58]Do you feel the headache in your penis?
[204:23.13]Call your doctor right away if it lasts for more than four hours.
[204:26.93]Or... Never mind.
[204:41.19]Use it as a Viagra replacement.
[205:01.24]Turn the game audio up?
[205:03.38]Am I that awful to listen to that you'd rather hear the same punching sound a thousand times?
[205:09.81]I don't.
[205:17.45]You are farming, my God.
[205:19.47]And I'm almost done.
[205:23.61]OK, everybody.
[205:26.49]Everybody get ready.
[205:27.97]This is the one.
[205:28.55]This is where nothing is going to stop me here.
[205:33.52]I'm not going to mess it up.
[205:34.26]I'm going to do good.
[205:39.00]Same strategy.
[205:41.60]Play smart.
[206:20.85]Meat extension.
[206:21.33]Who the fuck's that?
[206:40.22]Who meets?
[206:40.56]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[206:41.58]Don't get cocky.
[206:45.68]Chest.
[206:45.84]Chest.
[206:52.38]Alright, I'm gonna go.
[206:53.08]I'm gonna get out.
[206:54.20]I'm out.
[206:54.44]I'm out.
[206:54.62]I'm out.
[206:54.82]I'm done.
[206:55.12]I'm done.
[206:59.39]I'm out.
[206:59.63]I'm out.
[206:59.79]I'm done.
[207:00.07]I'm done.
[207:01.85]I'm done.
[207:02.17]I'm done.
[207:02.47]I'm done.
[207:02.79]I'm done.
[207:03.11]Oh my fucking god.
[207:03.91]Why did I do that?
[207:04.35]I should have just left.
[207:05.61]Why did I do this?
[207:06.45]I should have just left.
[207:07.21]Why did I do this?
[207:13.67]No, I just wanted to get one more.
[207:18.05]I hate this.
[207:20.39]I'm so fucking mad.
[207:24.12]I actually wanted just to leave, but I didn't.
[207:27.04]It was 30 seconds when you get hit.
[207:28.82]I thought it was 10.
[207:29.74]Oh, it hurts so bad.
[207:47.29]Why?
[207:47.95]Why did I do that to myself?
[207:49.65]I could have gone over there with like a gold super coin.
[207:52.11]I'm almost there.
[208:05.38]That sucks.
[208:23.79]Your candle has run out.
[208:24.99]I think Otto needs to go outside, maybe?
[208:38.42]Alright, I can do it.
[208:39.04]Here we go.
[208:42.17]Let's make a workbench.
[208:45.03]And then this duck can get to work.
[208:48.31]Boom.
[208:49.71]If you have a small friend, maybe they can use it.
[208:53.17]Come use it.
[208:54.65]Assign a friend to this workbench.
[208:56.95]A friend is now working at this workbench.
[208:59.63]Yeah!
[209:05.49]Okay.
[209:06.59]Now... I'm going to take a BRB.
[209:09.78]I'm going to get some water.
[209:11.04]I'm going to take care of Otto.
[209:13.42]And then I'm just going to leave this running.
[209:16.00]And I'll be back.
[209:17.32]Yeah, I'm not going to pause it.
[209:19.42]I'm just going to leave it on the screen.
[209:22.37]You can just tell people I fell asleep.
[209:24.30]I've been doing this for like 12 hours or something.
[209:25.84]I'll be right back.
[218:48.93]I'm back.
[218:50.65]Come here.
[218:51.78]I have to take care of Otto.
[218:57.78]I'm good.
[218:58.22]How much money did I make while I was gone?
[219:00.90]And did any of you take any of it?
[219:03.78]I counted.
[219:08.28]I know how much was there.
[219:09.57]I counted.
[219:10.01]Okay, I can do another house.
[219:22.25]And then there's definitely more than one meat here.
[219:24.23]Alright.
[219:28.23]Do not.
[219:29.64]I'm not going to mess this up.
[219:34.82]In fact, I'm going to wait for one more.
[219:40.28]Three meats last time.
[219:41.96]And then after this, I'm out of here.
[219:43.31]I'm going to the next game.
[219:56.56]We only took 7% of your revenue.
[219:58.64]You're going to still lose?
[220:13.10]Just rip off the band-aid.
[220:16.04]I think I'm going to win.
[220:18.94]This is when the bets happen and everybody bets on me losing and I end up with like 10 grand after coming out of here.
[220:34.98]There's got to be one more meat coming here soon.
[220:48.43]get hype get hype for gamba wow I think I actually I think I actually just pixel perfect did that the second it spawned and I didn't even mean to okay I'm ready alright everybody cheer for me here we go I have three minutes here oh no more than that is it three minutes or is it four minutes

[221:22.10]OK, this is like fucking this is more than five minutes now.
[221:25.88]Don't fuck it up.
[221:31.62]I have time.
[221:33.04]Be slow.
[221:33.68]I gotta use D pad for this as well.
[221:45.93]The aiming is a little weird.
[222:10.61]That chest.
[222:22.72]What if there's nothing here?
[222:23.60]It's a chest!
[222:25.18]Oops.
[222:54.99]I need more than this, come on.
[222:56.25]Alright, get out, get out, get out.
[223:06.17]I'm outta here.
[223:06.47]If they're on the way, I'll get it.
[223:22.03]This is on the way.
[223:28.31]This is technically on the way.
[223:36.55]This is on the way.
[223:37.21]Alright, I'm gone.
[223:48.58]This is on the way.
[224:19.29]Alright, I got two big coins.
[224:21.15]I made it.
[224:28.35]Your friends made one ingot.
[224:31.69]So what are the two moon coins?
[224:37.18]What was that other currency?
[224:38.38]What was that?
[224:50.74]That's just... Check that bag?
[224:58.35]Yeah, what happened to that?
[225:00.95]Oh.
[225:02.31]The bag holds two Zoldnax to spend in the wild zone.
[225:07.05]Try not to lose them.
[225:08.23]Spend in the wild zone.
[225:09.67]What?
[225:15.91]Okay.
[225:18.67]I got two people working.
[225:19.75]I got meat production.
[225:21.85]I got this.
[225:23.33]I think I can move on to the next game.
[225:28.96]I'll be back.
[225:34.79]So can I just, like, leave?
[225:35.95]Do I have to do anything special?
[225:37.53]Will this keep counting when I'm gone?
[225:49.82]It just saves it.
[225:50.46]Okay.
[225:51.36]Okay.
[225:54.80]Alright, that's Pilot Quest.
[225:56.30]That one was great.
[225:59.63]Minnie and Max.
[226:14.67]You can stay in the storage room tonight.
[226:17.05]But why?
[226:17.47]There's nothing to do in here.
[226:18.67]Because mom isn't here and I'm in charge.
[226:22.63]That's why.
[226:24.23]You can hang out with Max.
[226:29.26]It's not fair.
[226:29.94]Jeez.
[226:36.64]Two hours later.
[226:38.45]Feels like we've been locked in here forever.
[226:41.03]I'm so bored.
[226:43.01]I have an idea.
[226:44.87]Will it get us out of here?
[226:45.87]Maybe.
[226:47.91]This room is so small.
[226:49.30]We should try some shrinking.
[226:51.92]I don't know how to shrink.
[226:54.26]Maybe if we just crouch down and take small steps.
[226:59.56]That'll never work.
[227:00.94]Watch me try.
[227:05.56]How do I do that?
[227:15.24]Oh shit.
[227:17.84]What the hell?
[227:32.55]Kill bugs in the carpet.
[227:33.91]This is cool.
[227:34.53]Oh, a star.
[227:46.31]Can you pick it?
[227:48.53]Wait, what if I grow?
[227:49.89]Can I grow?
[227:50.35]What?
[227:55.05]Wait.
[228:01.91]I knew it.
[228:05.54]That's really, that's really cool.
[228:07.14]I like that.
[228:07.56]I like that mechanic a lot.
[228:18.26]Can I jump on top of stuff?
[228:19.28]Probably not.
[228:22.49]Another raid?
[228:22.95]Who?
[228:23.71]Another, another raid?
[228:25.69]Who raided?
[228:36.58]It was a one-person raid.
[228:38.26]Oh.
[228:42.20]Hey, thanks.
[228:43.48]What's up?
[229:02.40]Oh, thanks.
[229:03.08]Thanks.
[229:03.54]Dunkaroochoo2555.
[229:05.12]Okay, I gotta make Dunkaroochoo2555.
[229:09.53]And then I make the stream and people follow the stream because somebody watched this and I gotta make it right now.
[229:13.39]Go, go, go.
[229:13.75]Hurry.
[229:15.55]Somebody watched the stream and they'll see that he made that joke but then they'll go to that channel and they'll follow me.
[229:34.87]There's probably a few stars in every level, I imagine.
[229:36.66]Whoa.
[229:42.37]Oh, you actually don't get hurt.
[230:07.63]No!
[230:08.29]Is it fall damage?
[230:19.96]Hmm.
[230:21.84]Okay.
[230:27.79]What about over here?
[230:30.49]Wait, the dog... Go hang out with the dog.
[230:32.67]The dog told me to do this.
[230:33.73]He's probably like, what the fuck is she doing?
[230:39.91]I have a little house?
[230:48.17]Why don't you talk?
[230:57.61]Oh, it's up.
[231:11.61]There you are.
[231:12.07]I can't believe shrinking actually worked.
[231:15.50]Isn't it great?
[231:15.96]There's so much more room for everyone.
[231:18.26]If you want to find me later, meet me back on this roof.
[231:37.07]Oh, it's old Granny Smalls.
[231:40.31]That's me.
[231:41.35]I'm your grandmother.
[231:42.67]Your mother never told you that I lived in your carpet.
[231:45.37]And be careful when you use the vacuum, dearie.
[231:52.67]What do you want?
[231:53.23]Do you know a way out of this room?
[231:57.01]Are you stupid?
[231:57.71]You're standing in front of a door.
[231:59.01]I mean, is there a way out of the big room?
[232:01.67]All of this.
[232:03.57]I knew what you meant the first time.
[232:05.21]I was just messing with you.
[232:06.89]I might know something about getting out of here, but it'll cost you 20 shinies.
[232:11.98]Gee, you don't know much, do you?
[232:14.20]Yeah, they're all little shiny things.
[232:15.70]Look a bit like stars.
[232:17.97]Ever since they fell out of the sky two years ago, everyone's been using them for money.
[232:21.77]20 stars.
[232:36.58]Go away, this door isn't for you.
[232:43.50]It really isn't.
[232:54.69]What if I want to open the door so I can get out of here?
[232:57.11]Hey, I have 20!
[233:37.52]This power outlet is the property of King Mittens.
[233:50.79]I brought the money.
[233:54.35]What an... enterprising young lady you are!
[233:57.91]Now, let me answer your question.
[233:59.43]If you want to get out of this room, you're gonna have to talk to Mittens.
[234:03.89]that's my cat he always did whatever he darn well pleased but since the shinies fell he's been drunk with power declared himself a king and built a palace inside of the doorknob he's even got a bunch of oversized parasites he's bossing around he has the power to open the door for you but it won't be cheap to convince him if you're serious about getting out you'd better gather as many shinies as you can here take this it'll help you deal with the bugs roaming around these parts
[234:33.17]a super glove oh that's helpful what about my dog okay alright where do I want to go
[235:03.00]How about like here?
[235:03.58]On the shelf.
[235:12.94]Wait a minute.
[235:14.57]Will it fly up?
[235:17.27]No?
[235:17.39]This is such a cute idea.
[235:22.53]It really is.
[235:23.07]A lot of these games could just be standalone experiences on Steam.
[235:39.80]Killed it.
[235:40.24]I didn't mean to.
[235:54.36]Oops.
[235:59.17]What happens if I jump down here?
[236:00.23]Oh my god, you can go do- Oh, I just lost money for that.
[236:18.82]Ouch.
[236:20.04]Ah!
[236:32.77]Oh, I didn't lose money.
[236:36.60]Oh, okay.
[236:38.76]What about up here?
[236:47.92]Each shelf has a level.
[236:53.16]Ooh, cool.
[236:54.82]What about the other side?
[236:59.35]Nope.
[237:26.85]I was just sitting here with my mouth open.
[237:28.87]I'm dead.
[237:36.48]I have to go check.
[237:37.42]I have to.
[237:38.10]I need to see how much money I made.
[237:45.62]Wow!
[238:04.13]Resource silo for 50 ingots.
[238:07.69]Make another house, maybe?
[238:18.70]Can I build another house?
[238:28.10]There's a lot of workbenches, but only two houses.
[238:33.59]Oh, okay.
[238:49.26]I want one more meat and I'm going back in.
[238:50.68]Can we see the party game?
[238:55.14]Yes.
[238:56.49]I love that game.
[238:57.39]That's the best one so far.
[238:58.85]Or this.
[239:13.89]I still want to see the other ones.
[239:15.00]There's only like four or five left to see.
[239:24.90]Is this your game of the year?
[239:27.74]Probably.
[239:28.18]This and Withering Rooms, probably.
[239:31.67]I love Withering Rooms.
[239:34.93]It's so great.
[239:41.35]Don't sleep on that game.
[239:42.71]I know some of you are sleeping on that game, and it's... It's ridiculous that you are.
[239:53.69]Withering rooms not having, like, a hundred million installs... Is... It's just... Come on.
[240:00.87]What are we doing here?
[240:16.92]The art style.
[240:18.06]You don't like the art style?
[240:26.87]I actually love it.
[240:36.84]The game is very crusty.
[240:43.12]I think it's supposed to be that way.
[240:44.32]It's supposed to just be kind of crusty.
[240:49.63]Soundtrack is banger after banger.
[240:52.03]It's got one of the better soundtracks of better OSTs of the year.
[241:04.05]Story is really interesting.
[241:05.31]It's a really just weird story.
[241:10.32]The art direction in all the rooms, all the areas are just weird.
[241:13.70]There's something about it that's just so odd.
[241:16.36]I love it though.
[241:23.99]Alright, meat.
[241:24.89]Let's go.
[241:35.68]Let's go!
[241:36.26]You're the kind of guy to cut off the crust of your Subway sandwich.
[241:44.29]I'm the kind of guy to not eat at Subway.
[241:46.59]So, I think you got it wrong at the very beginning.
[242:08.28]I don't like these guys with the guns.
[242:09.42]What the hell is that?
[242:14.25]What the hell is that?
[242:18.25]No, it's too far away.
[242:19.37]Are you kidding me?
[242:23.48]Oh, you can get it.
[242:23.94]Okay.
[242:35.11]Dude, that hitbox is fucking a thousand meters!
[243:22.08]Oh, goodbye.
[243:25.88]It's on the way.
[243:43.61]Okay.
[243:45.33]Um...
[243:48.53]I still have a... I can take one hit before I need to panic.
[243:51.11]Is there anything else around the area?
[243:56.38]No.
[243:57.20]I'm getting out of here.
[244:05.90]Okay.
[244:09.90]The Vagult's three Zoldnax.
[244:12.42]Didn't I just get... Wait.
[244:17.59]Didn't I just get two?
[244:19.54]Weren't there... Am I getting scammed?
[244:49.01]Alright, I'm going to build the house and then I'm going to go to the next game.
[245:01.54]Oh, I only had two.
[245:02.33]I thought I had three for some reason.
[245:22.72]Please play the other games.
[245:26.46]I'm going to.
[245:27.14]I'm just setting myself up for some development here, that's all.
[245:54.46]Alright, I need two more of these.
[246:00.22]Ask your friend to take a break.
[246:01.50]Oh, shit.
[246:03.95]Is that bad?
[246:06.83]Is that bad?
[246:09.67]Alright, 20 ingots.
[246:12.33]Friendly alien shows up and claims it.
[246:13.79]Okay, so there's another alien.
[246:18.46]Okay, I need five more to make sure that all three are working.
[246:21.48]So, I'm not done yet.
[246:40.18]I need one more meat and I'm going to go get it.
[246:41.54]You know what?
[246:42.34]No.
[246:42.74]Watch this.
[246:44.17]Fuck this.
[246:44.79]Rewatch this.
[246:50.03]I'm going to speedrun.
[246:50.61]I'm going to get five ingots right now.
[247:20.79]Goodbye.
[247:34.02]Where's the exit?
[247:37.91]It's down here.
[247:44.95]Okay.
[247:45.55]I'm good.
[247:54.24]Okay, I have four of these coins.
[247:58.82]Three more and we're good.
[248:11.82]No, my ten points.
[248:13.66]So what is this guy's deal?
[248:14.58]Does he not do anything?
[248:15.32]Okay.
[248:41.68]I think I'm going to do one more expedition with... Ooh, that was good.
[248:46.58]With two meats.
[248:50.30]No, no, we'll do one meat.
[248:51.18]I don't have time to... I want to see the other games.
[248:54.06]Okay.
[249:14.99]I know, I'm working on it.
[249:15.63]I'm trying to get your station ready.
[249:21.65]So, upgrading the yo-yo is 150.
[249:26.67]Big silo's... stamina pill?
[249:29.15]I don't even know what the hell that stuff... There's a whole other currency that I haven't unlocked.
[249:39.92]Okay, let's go.
[249:41.96]Speedrun, looking for two ingots.
[249:46.14]I'm going for it.
[249:52.84]Oh, I got five.
[249:54.38]Alright, I'll be back.
[250:05.84]I wanted to hit right, but it didn't.
[250:08.32]I need to use the D-pad.
[250:09.20]Stop using the analog for this.
[250:39.56]Whoa, I thought that was an item.
[250:43.18]It was not an item.
[250:44.78]Now I have to leave.
[250:45.48]Oh, come on.
[250:47.06]I did get a meat though.
[250:59.30]And a coin.
[251:11.35]I can go right back in.
[251:24.48]Alright.
[251:26.98]I got three workers.
[251:30.15]Making me three ingots a minute.
[251:33.39]Speedrun.
[251:34.55]And then I'm moving to another game.
[251:41.07]I'm going to go up.
[251:42.35]I want to try to go up to that weird spot.
[251:46.01]Yeah, up here.
[251:54.82]Oh my god.
[251:55.84]You're killing me.
[252:18.60]Guys gotta drop something good.
[252:20.32]Really?
[252:20.60]That's... Whoa!
[252:27.61]Nope, not ready to fight this.
[252:28.76]Is there a chest or something up here?
[252:31.90]The hell is that?
[253:03.69]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[253:08.76]Why do I lose my coins?
[253:12.02]I thought they were in a bag.
[253:13.22]Wait, I take them all in?
[253:16.24]That's what was confusing me.
[253:17.68]Because I was like, wait a minute, didn't I have three?
[253:20.82]But you just don't keep them here.
[253:23.40]You bring them every time.
[253:27.15]That bug told me.
[253:28.21]I wouldn't listen to this guy.
[253:29.41]Oh, fuck.
[253:46.90]Combatants.
[253:54.14]A hill to die on.
[253:56.42]First blood?
[253:57.38]Wait, what?
[254:23.04]The red ants have taken our land.
[254:24.60]We only have one queen left.
[254:28.12]Let's fight back.
[254:28.90]Feed our queen to create more ants, but be careful.
[254:32.04]The red ants are very strong.
[254:33.24]Our great comeback begins now.
[254:34.54]Okay.
[254:42.36]Command menu.
[254:44.90]Make workers?
[254:46.74]Instinct, hold, follow...
[254:54.54]Oh, wait a minute.
[254:56.46]Okay.
[255:01.24]Oh, no.
[255:07.20]Hold.
[255:13.48]Oh, wait, no, no, no.
[255:14.25]Um... Make workers?

[256:35.58]Okay, turn this in.
[256:51.13]How come it's not making a soldier when three... This three just... Oh.
[256:55.03]Okay.
[256:56.37]Now what?

[257:35.38]And then we're all gonna fight.
[257:48.66]Alright.
[257:49.25]Attack.
[257:54.63]Kill him.
[258:00.02]Yes.
[258:03.76]Kill.
[258:09.98]Everybody come.
[258:10.60]Come on.

[258:23.22]kill the queen why are they why are they leaving cool oh interesting
[258:53.23]Okay, I get it.
[258:57.58]Small army to defeat them.
[258:58.56]Unfortunately, we can't spare any more ants right now.
[259:01.30]We're counting on your leadership.
[259:04.10]Oh, shit.
[259:04.92]Alright.
[259:06.40]Everybody just go instinct.
[259:07.40]No, follow.
[259:10.30]Everybody follow me.
[259:19.62]Get over here.
[259:20.18]What are they all doing?
[259:24.55]Is there a- is it a Pikmin?
[259:25.49]Is it like a radius to get them to follow you?
[259:29.03]I think so.
[259:31.47]Alright, let's go.
[259:39.78]Now turn on instinct!
[259:50.30]Don't do instinct, just throw stuff.
[259:55.10]Bait them!
[260:03.29]Bait them!
[260:12.34]Stop walking into them!
[260:26.67]Good.
[260:29.25]God damn it.
[260:32.90]Alright, I want everybody here because I only have three.
[260:34.54]Stay together.
[260:56.86]Yeah!
[261:02.26]The game is UFO 50, and the cartridge is called... Ants?
[261:07.68]Combat Ants.
[261:13.80]Okay, we found an area with a lot of food, but there's a Red Queen and two workers.
[261:18.28]Fortunately.
[261:18.70]We have the element of surprise.
[261:20.64]Build up an army quickly and take them out.
[261:22.32]Okay.
[261:25.70]Kill him!
[261:28.90]Good.
[261:57.90]being a hero.
[261:58.26]Alright, we need soldiers.
[262:10.53]Okay.
[262:28.15]Come get the food.
[262:31.75]Let's go, get out.
[262:33.29]Go, go, go.
[262:33.94]What were you thinking?
[262:46.62]Oh, they're building up a fucking army.
[262:58.42]They don't have their leader, they're useless without me!
[263:05.35]Ow!
[263:13.79]What, they're not even firing at anything!
[263:21.37]Pick up something!
[263:27.33]Just guard the food.
[263:28.25]Don't let them get any food.
[263:29.17]Guard the food.
[263:33.86]If we control the food, we control the war.

[266:02.90]I'm doing a hundred bucks on lightning to win and I gave him drugs.
[266:06.48]Okay, here we go.
[266:12.87]A new diet is the most likely cause.
[266:15.09]Fans excited for the big race to begin.
[266:16.59]He walked right into a banana.
[266:24.56]Is he dead?
[266:25.08]I gave him drugs too and he's always losing.
[266:44.22]I'm ruined.
[266:51.26]Wins zero.
[266:52.99]Alright, I'm betting on snowball.
[266:54.73]I'm doing a $200 bet.
[267:17.79]8 to 1 odds.

[267:58.85]No bullshit.
[268:10.89]Wait, he went crazy.
[268:14.40]Okay, it's in my favor.
[268:15.44]The only way I win is if one of the other racers attack the other one.
[268:19.26]You're not going to hit that rock, right?
[268:23.56]There we go.
[268:24.28]Let's go.
[268:32.61]That's just 1 to 1.
[268:35.93]Shit.
[268:37.99]Okay, this guy's a winner.
[268:44.54]But, if I bet on lightning, and I... Okay, I'm gonna hit the nose with a bat.
[268:55.86]and let's go cheetah is limping this morning oh my god somebody I'm gonna be fine he attacked the other guy and I attacked him so just this lightning just has to literally fall over the finish line and I made a bunch of money come on don't be an idiot here

[269:32.36]Big time.

[269:36.80]Why?
[269:37.42]You knocked yourself out.
[269:38.82]Okay, what happens if you have no money left?
[269:46.37]Oh, I have to... Oops.
[269:50.01]Okay, I get how it works.
[269:50.95]I know what this game is.
[269:51.97]I get it.
[269:52.31]I understand how it works now.
[270:22.24]Who's the favorite here?
[270:23.06]Okay, I'm betting on Wiggins and I'm gonna mess with Glory.
[270:29.68]Let's go.
[270:42.47]Poison makes it so if they fall over they can straight up die.
[270:47.75]Alright.
[270:49.73]Fink is a piece of shit.
[270:53.49]And explain to me why Fink is running that fast.
[271:03.33]Come on, Wiggins.
[271:04.07]Let's go.
[271:06.07]Better cross that finish line.
[271:08.07]Thank God.
[271:08.67]Alright, that's a better start.
[271:21.45]Okay, I'm betting on Bossimo and we're going to drop... Pills on El Rey.
[271:38.96]200 buck bet.
[271:40.16]Let's go.
[271:43.80]I got caught doing that and I just got fined $80.
[271:53.88]But I still get to participate.
[271:59.64]The random meteor shower just saved everything.
[272:02.68]Don't land in front of me.
[272:03.50]Come on.
[272:03.78]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[272:04.82]Hit him.
[272:05.02]Hit him.
[272:05.28]Hit him.
[272:05.60]Hit him.
[272:06.53]Hit him.
[272:07.87]Hit him with one.
[272:08.69]Oh, get up and run.
[272:12.75]You fucking dumbass.
[272:15.39]Go.
[272:15.87]Oh.
[272:27.08]I didn't know you could get caught.
[272:28.12]Alright, Bossimo.
[272:40.37]And we're just going straight up.
[272:45.63]He probably had security.
[272:50.97]Sponsor somebody.
[272:57.55]What does little dude in the hole mean?
[273:03.82]Okay, he literally just killed himself.
[273:07.20]What?
[273:10.04]Why did my guy just die?
[273:11.30]What killed him?
[273:17.46]What killed him?
[273:26.77]He just jumped and landed on his face and died.
[273:28.65]Alright, I'm gonna start it one more time.
[273:39.35]Somebody must have poisoned him.
[273:40.53]Oh shit.
[273:42.25]Oh, I can be me from the other game.
[273:43.63]We're doing it.
[273:47.63]Okay.
[273:52.51]I'm betting on wildcard.
[273:58.55]No.
[274:01.76]And we're gonna whack... Who's... Okay, we're gonna whack Glory.
[274:12.48]I could do a loan.
[274:15.75]Okay.
[274:16.57]I'm gonna sponsor Snowball.
[274:26.09]What is this?
[274:27.82]Welcome to the stables.
[274:31.10]Train snowball?
[274:33.22]Yeah.
[274:37.78]He's getting speed, too.
[274:40.30]Holy shit.
[274:42.18]Okay.
[274:46.02]Let's go.
[274:46.38]Okay.
[274:58.23]Everybody bet on, uh, the bottom dude.
[275:01.72]Just don't.
[275:05.36]No.
[275:06.72]Alright, well.
[275:09.54]Don't blow this right now.
[275:10.82]Come on.
[275:11.40]Wildcard, you can do it.
[275:12.52]Everyone's betting on you.
[275:13.46]We all poisoned the other guy.
[275:15.58]I think we all poisoned the middle guy.
[275:17.06]Well, I hit him with a bat.
[275:21.51]But that's a big win.
[275:22.47]Okay.
[275:26.59]Okay.
[275:33.34]He's doing better.
[275:38.22]Let's bet on Hadzir.
[275:42.66]Let's go $200.
[275:45.81]And I'm going to protect Hadzir.
[275:47.89]Protect my investment.
[275:53.63]I'm already sponsoring somebody.
[275:54.99]Uh-oh.
[276:07.77]Oh, he got caught giving boosters to Hadzear.
[276:13.58]I didn't get caught.
[276:17.20]Oh, this is gonna be... Look at that smooth sailing right in front of us.
[276:25.24]Straight shot.
[276:32.45]Here we go.
[276:39.72]Much better.
[276:40.16]Alright, Snowball.
[276:42.17]Can we train Snowball again?
[276:44.91]Yes, we can.
[276:47.35]Snowball is incredibly fast now.
[276:49.53]I've spent a lot of money.
[276:50.59]They're just very clumsy.
[276:53.01]But we can fix that.
[276:54.43]By giving him illegal drugs.
[277:04.52]Okay.
[277:08.54]This is a big deal.
[277:12.45]Go.
[277:21.26]Well, he's very fast.
[277:27.04]Look at him go.
[277:27.58]He's so fast.
[277:30.48]Get up.
[277:32.98]Come on.
[277:35.28]Yes.
[277:37.48]And he's sponsored.
[277:40.76]That's the biggest win of the whole evening here.
[277:49.42]What just happened?
[277:54.02]What just happened?
[278:00.35]I didn't bet on him?
[278:01.47]Wait, what?
[278:03.33]No way!
[278:03.87]I didn't click the button on him?
[278:08.99]Are you serious?
[278:10.35]How did that even happen?
[278:17.56]I didn't bet.
[278:18.96]Oh, I've, I just, maybe, did I just like assume that it was on him because I sponsored him?
[278:26.23]You can, oh my god.
[278:28.87]Oh, that's so sad.
[278:32.11]Oh, come on, man.
[278:39.33]Give him more fucking drugs, whatever.
[278:40.89]Okay, make sure he's selected.
[278:46.94]Fuck, how could I possibly have done that wrong?
[278:53.40]I was so excited.
[278:55.24]No, I definitely clicked it, didn't I?
[278:57.24]That's insane.
[278:57.92]He's dead!
[279:07.96]No!
[279:09.14]I didn't even get my return.
[279:10.19]How did I fuck that up?
[279:13.07]How did I not bet on him?
[279:15.85]And now he's dead.
[279:21.59]That's so... How?
[279:30.09]You gotta be shitting me.
[279:39.61]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[279:41.06]Okay, well, let's just bet on this guy because he's 9 to 1 and just bet my fucking whole bank account.
[279:55.58]and give drugs to lightning.
[280:07.69]I can't believe I assumed that just because I sponsored it doesn't mean I bet on him.
[280:11.29]Alright, hopefully the one down there falls down and dies.
[280:23.00]Fall.
[280:23.98]Fall!
[280:32.40]I'm so mad at myself for not being so excited that I just forgot to bet on my own character.
[280:38.32]Okay, uh, with Bossimo.
[280:49.48]Let's, let's spawn, let's... I'm gonna sponsor Booger.
[281:01.57]You'll be ready booger, don't worry.
[281:21.66]I'm assuming that Glory is that the other person is going to be fucking with prickles.
[281:27.25]Let's go.
[281:33.14]That's a clean shot.
[281:35.33]No bullshit in the way.
[281:44.69]Did you really just kick through everything?
[281:46.09]Alright, knock him out.
[281:51.30]How did you walk through three things on the ground?
[282:00.17]Alright, booger.
[282:04.37]You can do it.
[282:10.29]Princesses?
[282:11.41]Okay.
[282:15.23]Click the fucking bet button, actually.
[282:16.93]Sponsor doesn't mean bet.
[282:18.29]Alright, this one's not a problem.
[282:24.57]I'm imagining that Gunther is going to be going after Princess, so I'm going to do this.
[282:28.07]I'll just protect myself.
[282:37.40]Okay.
[282:38.18]Protect myself.
[282:41.42]I think I'm good.
[282:43.40]Already trained.
[282:44.06]52 speed, that's not great, but it's okay.
[282:47.89]Alright, let's go for it.
[282:50.11]Of course, a bunch of... Why are they going after me?
[283:00.41]That's right.
[283:01.13]Not kick it away.
[283:03.62]Kick it away.
[283:06.38]Fall down.
[283:16.93]Oh no, I'm going to zero.
[283:30.16]This quibble is retired?
[283:32.76]Why am I still sponsoring him?
[283:40.83]Alright, prickles.
[283:58.87]I'm gonna go all in on this fucking dude.
[284:01.77]I can't believe I fucked that bet up.
[284:03.25]I'm so pissed off.
[284:05.87]Just fill Domino with rugs.
[284:09.07]I can't be the only one doing it.
[284:13.89]Did I bet?
[284:14.37]Did I not bet?
[284:14.97]Did I not bet?
[284:15.55]I don't think I bet.
[284:16.09]I don't think I clicked it.
[284:16.73]Did I?
[284:24.36]I don't think I... Did I click bet?
[284:30.57]Why is it so confusing to me?
[284:32.43]I think it's because it's like... I don't know.
[284:34.51]Why am I not getting that?
[284:37.03]That's not clicking in my brain to do that first.
[284:39.28]I don't know why.
[284:43.16]No, I did.
[284:43.64]Okay.
[284:49.16]Don't you dare.
[284:50.96]You really just blew that so bad.
[285:02.23]Turns out it would have been better if I didn't.
[285:07.20]You know what?
[285:07.48]I think it's because it's already set.
[285:09.34]You know what I mean?
[285:11.24]It's like already bet on somebody when you go to a new screen.
[285:17.81]So in my like weird like chimpanzee brain, it's like, oh, it's already been clicked.
[285:29.84]This is great though.
[285:30.54]I would have beat it the first time.
[285:52.61]Oh shit.
[285:54.62]I'm sponsoring this one.
[285:59.26]What does this even do?
[286:00.55]Like, more info on Fink, for instance.
[286:04.33]Fink is the slowest quibble in the current race, and clumsy.
[286:08.47]Right.
[286:26.62]I just poisoned that guy.
[286:40.03]Hey, some poison that was.
[286:41.36]Oh.
[286:50.32]Well, that's a win.
[286:51.06]Oops.
[287:00.33]Do you get caught doing that?
[287:03.27]Okay, I got money this time.
[287:16.21]Who do I want to bet on?
[287:17.55]I bet on SuperQ.
[287:23.95]And I'm just gonna go 100 bucks.
[287:27.72]I don't trust anything right now.
[287:28.88]We're gonna get El Rey up high.
[287:41.51]I have faith.
[287:43.03]Should I help?
[287:45.16]Okay, I'm gonna banana peel wild card just because... Alright, I'm good.
[287:49.22]Yeah, this is fine.
[287:52.28]That's not good.
[287:52.84]Somebody poisoned him.
[287:57.62]Hair quality is at a record low.
[288:01.09]This is a total toss-up now, so that's alright.
[288:07.31]Oh no.
[288:07.61]Oh no.
[288:10.43]He's just full of rage.
[288:15.13]I think he's still gonna make it.
[288:20.93]He's dead.
[288:31.08]That's sad.
[288:38.20]They're both going to zero.
[288:40.93]Just don't go to zero and I'll beat them both just from lasting.
[288:46.61]By the way, where is El Rey?
[288:48.14]I've not seen El Rey pop up once.
[288:53.72]I'm going to bet on Snowball.
[288:56.36]I want some intel on Snowball.
[289:00.40]Okay, second fastest in the race.
[289:03.84]Wild Card's probably the fastest, so let's...
[289:11.08]Do that.
[289:12.26]I'm going big on this.
[289:18.20]Okay.
[289:26.83]Steady.
[289:28.79]Steady.
[289:32.63]Okay.
[289:34.30]No, get up.
[289:36.55]Okay, well he's dead.
[289:37.25]This is good, this is good, this is good, this is gonna be fine.
[289:39.77]There's so many obstacles in front of a wild card.
[289:47.16]What happens if they both die?
[289:50.34]Yes.
[290:02.91]Okay, there's El Rey.
[290:07.39]And I'm going to protect El Rey and we're going to do a max bet.
[290:12.72]Everybody's coming for El Rey.
[290:16.94]See that five out of five?
[290:18.02]I think I'm good.
[290:24.96]I think that's all I can do here.
[290:28.25]Let's just make sure I'm good.
[290:30.29]Bet.
[290:31.57]Go.
[290:36.07]You got caught.
[290:41.30]You were boosting El Rey, okay.
[290:45.22]This could make things very difficult, unfortunately.
[290:50.36]Oh.
[290:51.92]He's fast, though.
[290:55.66]That's fine.
[290:56.34]That's fine.
[290:57.04]I don't even know what these little guys do, but hopefully nothing bad.
[290:59.04]We're good.
[291:02.53]El Rey is unstoppable.
[291:08.03]And the sponsor money.
[291:12.19]Let's go.
[291:13.41]El Rey again.
[291:13.95]Okay.
[291:18.33]I'm protecting El Rey again.
[291:19.48]70?
[291:36.84]Max bet again.
[291:38.60]Sponsor money too.
[291:39.48]This should be big.
[291:47.04]I'm not going to get caught doing anything.
[291:48.21]I'm just going to protect him.
[291:50.99]Uh-oh.
[292:00.05]Bad air quality.
[292:01.85]He's fast, though.
[292:02.89]This shouldn't be a problem.
[292:08.53]Come on, get up, Elray.
[292:09.33]Did you just trip over him?
[292:13.92]I can't believe Black Eye's going to win.
[292:17.35]Black eye.
[292:17.81]You gotta be kidding me.
[292:18.55]Oh shit.
[292:23.47]You motherfucker.
[292:31.72]Oh, this is the last round.
[292:34.24]Alright, we're gonna go.
[292:34.94]We gotta go all in.
[292:35.92]It's boy.
[292:36.22]This is kind of like Jeopardy.
[292:37.06]Hold on.
[292:37.34]How much money does everybody have?
[292:42.82]Can I see the info of the other players?
[292:50.61]How do I see everybody else's money?
[292:55.63]You can't.
[292:56.41]Because I think this is like Jeopardy, right?
[292:58.34]I gotta go for it.
[293:04.78]Use info?
[293:08.74]I think I buy it for just a quibble.
[293:15.69]Alright, we go 2,000 on Wiggins and hope for the 4,000.
[293:23.89]What about Booger?
[293:28.13]They're so broke, just don't bet.
[293:30.39]Somebody just won like $3,000 in the last one.
[293:36.04]The last round, somebody was up like two grand, three grand.
[293:44.26]What is the win condition?
[293:45.08]Just having the most money at the end or having the most wins?
[293:52.88]They're both sponsored, though.
[293:58.82]Okay.
[294:00.94]Deeble sponsored both of them, so Deeble obviously is not going to do anything.
[294:03.69]Okay, Deeble's not going to do anything to this one.
[294:05.87]Oh, give me some info.
[294:09.81]Booger's the second fastest.
[294:11.93]Expect garbage.
[294:13.31]Oh, Booger's not going to do well here.
[294:21.30]So it's either wild card or Wiggins.
[294:29.87]I think we're going Wiggins.
[294:32.07]And I'm going to protect Wiggins.
[294:38.17]No, no, no.
[294:38.53]Wild card.
[294:38.95]We're going wild card.
[294:40.63]Wiggins is fast.
[294:59.11]I've made my decision.
[295:04.56]Yep.
[295:14.48]Shit.
[295:17.54]No, I was thinking I lost everything.
[295:19.28]No, don't say that yet.
[295:20.56]He could die.
[295:23.03]He could die right now.
[295:26.07]There's so much shit in front of Booger, there's no way.
[295:27.71]Alright, Wild Card has to die.
[295:28.97]Okay, come on.
[295:33.31]Come on, get up and cross the finish line.
[295:35.05]Come on, get up and cross the finish line.
[295:35.92]You're good.
[295:36.42]You're right there.
[295:37.74]Wild Card's gonna die, for sure.
[295:39.02]He's dead.
[295:41.44]Cross the finish line, you can do it.
[295:42.94]Come on.
[295:43.34]No!
[295:43.40]Yes!
[295:54.32]That's the, uh, that's the victory right there, isn't it?
[296:02.62]Yeah!
[296:07.60]Bro.
[296:09.16]What the f- Oh my god, dude.
[296:11.48]That guy was a lunatic.
[296:17.80]I did it.
[296:20.63]That was really fun.
[296:21.71]I liked that one a lot.
[296:28.55]I didn't think you could even take out a lawn for more than two or 3000.
[296:31.29]Damn.
[296:31.49]Yeah, that was good stuff.
[296:36.50]That was fun.
[296:36.84]I liked that one a lot.
[296:41.91]You can increase the rounds.
[296:45.75]I wonder what the max rounds are.
[296:48.74]What every cartridge has is just simply beating it gets you the gold.
[296:53.91]But there's also like a cherry, I think.
[296:57.11]Like each cartridge has two or three different difficulty tiers of getting, like claiming whatever it is.
[297:05.71]Only a few hundred quibbles were harmed in the making of this game.
[297:12.04]Cherry is for winning $10,000.
[297:17.40]Cool.
[297:19.40]I want to go to my garden.
[297:20.50]Where's the garden?
[297:27.55]How do you get to the garden?
[297:32.89]There it is.
[297:35.55]So for doing certain things, you get, um, you get little trinkets to put.
[297:45.38]So where's...
[297:48.62]I got a computer here from Quibble Race.
[297:53.81]Ghost from Night Manor.
[297:57.55]Mirror from Rakasha.
[298:02.18]Cool.
[298:06.02]Fruit.
[298:08.18]Party house.
[298:08.78]Oh, I love party house.
[298:11.91]And you get to have a little magical garden.
[298:21.24]Alright, still a few more that I haven't seen.
[298:24.52]Seaside Drive.
[298:25.64]Imagining, yeah, going to be a driving game.
[298:40.30]Shoot sideways, shoot upward, and then drift.
[298:46.02]Cool.
[298:47.36]Cool.
[298:52.27]Interesting.
[298:52.85]Ooh, this one feels good.
[299:07.36]I like the feel of this one.
[299:08.46]Probably should juggle it, shouldn't I?
[299:38.08]What is the bottom bar doing?
[299:45.93]The broken ass thing killed me?
[299:58.46]This stupid broken thing killed me!
[300:21.34]Charge down?
[300:22.04]Oh, you have to be moving.
[300:25.76]That's what that thing means.
[300:37.06]Oh jeez.
[300:38.18]Oh jeez.
[300:47.27]Oh jeez.
[301:01.14]Oh!
[301:08.07]I like this one.
[301:13.38]They have to go backwards to charge to shoot.
[301:17.32]Extra damage.
[301:27.37]Cubes.
[301:37.52]You gotta be very tactical with this one.
[301:44.07]Only us tactical gamers can play this one.
[301:59.02]Don't even talk to me unless you're a tactical gamer.
[302:14.41]Did I get a 1-up yet?
[302:16.46]Yikes!
[302:23.90]Yikes!
[302:48.72]Wow.
[303:03.50]I've gotten a million points so far.
[303:04.66]Where's my one up?
[303:18.53]Now this balloons.
[303:26.76]Oh dear, that's a lot of gumdrops.
[303:57.42]Oh shit, they detach.
[304:33.91]That wasn't easy.
[304:35.51]That wasn't easy.
[304:43.90]DVD logo.
[304:48.76]That was a DVD.
[304:49.62]That was five DVD logos.
[304:52.49]Get the coin.
[305:05.22]Breakout.
[305:05.70]That's cool.
[305:09.30]That's the coin.
[305:09.82]Give me it.
[305:14.37]Oh, I just got two one-ups.
[305:34.27]Whoa, that's not good.
[305:39.61]Halloween level school.
[305:58.57]Let's get hit now.
[306:07.92]No, like 100,000 points.
[306:09.32]I'm doing pretty good.
[306:15.86]Oh, that angle.
[306:25.52]There we go.
[306:25.92]I'm alright.
[306:26.84]Saved it.
[306:36.82]Ouch.
[306:39.20]Okay, I have two more lives.
[306:46.21]What's the boss?
[306:48.57]Uh-oh.
[307:07.00]These guys have a lot of health.
[307:27.63]Oh, that was close.
[307:38.17]Dude, give him, just give him three buttons.
[307:42.71]Hey, sometimes it's accurate.
[308:07.57]Honestly, it's the need to be constantly moving, which is why I'm doing well at this.
[308:12.36]Moving is part of the charging.
[308:15.26]I always have to be moving.
[308:28.21]Bright screen.
[308:38.85]Bonus round?
[308:39.69]Possible?
[308:44.72]Alright, come on.
[308:45.78]Let me first try this.
[308:47.26]Technically second try.
[308:48.06]That probably would have killed me.
[309:10.78]Oh, OK.
[309:22.50]Oh shit, I didn't see the middle.
[309:23.72]It's OK.
[309:26.80]I was so locked in, I didn't see the wave.
[309:34.97]Ah shit, I'm losing it.
[309:38.17]Alright, come on, get it together.
[309:41.94]Oh, man.
[309:42.98]Fuck.
[309:44.94]It's that extreme change of pace.
[309:48.12]Damn it.
[309:54.60]It's like the immediate end and they're just coming at you.
[309:59.61]This one's fun.
[310:03.61]That was really fun.
[310:07.79]I think I could do that.
[310:08.95]I'm pretty sure I could get through that.
[310:11.84]But I want to see the other ones.
[310:17.88]What's the candle?
[310:18.68]It's a revolutionary new FPS horror game that is never going to release.
[310:27.79]We had some fun with it earlier.
[310:28.87]Okay, what is this one?
[310:34.68]First person?
[310:42.29]Hey pilot, be careful out there.
[310:45.75]What is going on here?
[310:49.81]Whoa.
[310:51.81]It's a 3D shooter.
[310:58.45]Yes, sideways and forwards.
[311:01.93]OK, alright, OK.
[311:08.96]I like I do.
[311:09.62]I appreciate the VR chaperone lines.
[311:41.35]What's the final game?
[311:42.37]I wonder.
[311:47.90]How do you aim in a... Oh, you have to be... I get it.
[311:50.08]It's whatever way you're dashing away from.
[311:51.88]Oh, okay.
[312:02.62]You have to be going down.
[312:04.12]This one's interesting.
[312:22.71]I wonder if there's bosses.
[312:24.03]Oh.
[312:27.65]That's sad.
[312:31.55]Wait, did I start over?
[312:32.23]I did.
[312:35.39]Alright, I like this one.
[312:39.56]But I want to see what the last one is.
[312:40.64]This is called Cyber Owls.
[312:43.42]This is the final game in the pack.
[312:48.02]I do want to go play Party House.
[312:52.65]A secret Hawk base somewhere.
[312:54.16]Legionella, Mr. President, the notorious rogue commando group Hawk has somehow acquired a doomsday weapon.
[313:09.41]Oops.
[313:12.07]They're gonna, they're where, that's, they're coming after us.
[313:18.67]Hawk is threatening to use their new doomsday missile if their demands aren't met in 24 hours.
[313:25.96]I've located their four secret bases around the world.
[313:28.06]If you each take one, we might find the missile in time.
[313:33.38]I calculate a 4% chance of success in this operation.
[313:36.04]Good luck.
[313:41.19]Moscow, Hong Kong, Chicago, Hong Kong.
[313:46.47]Let's go to the UAE.
[313:47.07]Let's go to Chicago.
[313:50.54]Yes.
[313:50.66]Cool.
[314:10.21]Cool.
[314:10.55]This one's fun too.
[314:11.51]They're all fun.
[314:13.00]Honestly, out of all the 50 games,
[314:37.53]I don't think I dislike any of them.
[314:39.87]I think I would prefer to not play some of them because maybe not my type of game that I like to play.
[314:46.41]Maybe some of the more like puzzle ones.
[314:49.41]But this is great.
[315:09.47]That was faster than I thought it was going to be.
[315:11.47]Oh my god, I'm dead.
[315:24.44]Watch out!
[315:26.26]I tried to duck.
[315:51.95]Shoot!
[316:01.27]Plus one letter grade?
[316:02.06]No.
[316:02.22]Don't fall!
[316:17.65]Whoa!
[316:19.03]I didn't know that was coming.
[316:26.07]Oops.
[316:35.79]Dude, this one is good.
[316:36.97]Oh, they're all good.
[316:38.81]How do you even pick one?
[316:45.39]I do want to see... Let's go to Moscow.
[316:50.82]World Class Spy.
[316:53.64]So is it kind of a different game for each one?
[316:55.72]Or a different style?
[317:03.17]It is a different game for each one.
[317:04.77]Okay.
[317:15.42]Can you do a top 50 in no particular order?
[317:17.66]I probably could.
[317:23.24]Or I could do like S tier, A tier, B tier.
[317:26.70]Okay, X is... Tranquilizer.
[317:36.35]I think the goal is just to get at it.
[317:37.33]I don't think I have to even attack anything if I don't want to.
[317:47.28]That's funny.
[317:50.56]I need a red keycard.
[318:07.09]I'm out.
[318:17.41]I think I'm killing people, by the way.
[318:29.38]Oh god.
[318:32.08]I wonder how good the stealth actually is.
[318:33.90]Can I just hide behind this box?
[318:36.45]Yes, okay.
[318:41.40]I didn't know how sensitive it was.
[318:42.54]Okay, grenade.
[318:49.32]Whoa.
[318:50.02]What's that?
[319:10.45]I killed myself with that grenade and nobody else got hit.
[319:18.55]What?
[319:25.95]I want to see the other ones.
[319:27.49]I think this is a racing one.
[319:32.79]In Hong Kong.
[319:37.45]Oh, I want to play this one.
[319:39.37]Let's go.
[319:41.29]Here we go.
[319:52.22]OK.
[319:55.64]I think it looks like just jump and shoot.
[320:07.29]Hey, there's only two buttons.
[320:16.12]This could just be... I don't even know if that was a bad guy.
[320:26.01]I'm afraid to touch those, even though they're destroyed.
[320:28.41]I feel like I could still get hurt.
[320:32.43]Uh, what?
[320:33.77]What just happened?
[320:57.53]Jeez.
[320:57.91]Reminds me of the Battletoads level.
[321:03.59]Y'all know what I'm talking about.
[321:04.59]That shit took like a hundred tries to beat.
[321:27.07]I was trying to blow up the big truck.
[321:30.91]Okay, there's one more.
[321:36.02]Okay.
[321:38.06]Wait.
[321:39.12]I have to fly in and rescue.
[321:44.48]What is this?
[321:52.13]What is going on?
[322:10.35]Oh no, that was more than two buttons.
[322:12.11]That's right.
[322:12.45]Alright, I want to play Party House.
[322:21.18]That was very cool.
[322:25.68]You didn't see me play these ones.
[322:27.74]They were very cool.
[322:28.54]You didn't see me play, like, but... This one's awesome.
[322:34.59]Party House is a game where you have to let people in
[322:41.39]and each person has three potential little kind of things that could be on their character.
[322:49.20]Let's give an example.
[322:51.68]So for instance, when I first opened this, I said, ah, this is, what is this?
[322:57.39]I don't care about this.
[322:59.87]After about five minutes of actually trying to figure out what's even going on, this is one of my favorite games of the whole year.
[323:05.75]I love this game.
[323:07.11]I love it.
[323:08.18]This is number one.
[323:08.88]This is S+.
[323:09.72]This is probably my favorite one in the whole collection.
[323:12.38]So,
[323:14.16]There's stuff in the top right.
[323:16.30]There's population, there's money, and then there's time, which is rounds.
[323:21.83]What you do is you start the quote party and you open the door.
[323:28.42]The person that just came in here, this person is worth one population.
[323:34.08]That's it.
[323:35.24]It scores when you decide to end the round, which is the party, or if you fill the party.
[323:42.14]It's random.
[323:43.10]I don't know who's going to be through this door.
[323:45.62]Okay.
[323:46.32]So here's the thing.
[323:47.45]This person's worth two.
[323:49.13]So right now I have three points.
[323:50.93]Population is effectively points and you use it to buy stuff later.
[323:54.29]The problem is this dude's got an X.
[323:57.99]What that means is if three people go through this door with an X, the party's over, the round is ruined, and it sets you back big time.
[324:09.56]It's popularity, not population.
[324:12.68]I don't care, okay?
[324:14.71]I headcanoned it as population.
[324:20.97]Okay, it's not population, it's popularity.
[324:24.75]Let me explain the game properly.
[324:28.72]So, I'm gonna open this door.
[324:30.96]Okay, we're good.
[324:31.98]If three people have an X, if three people are a troublemaker, it's over.
[324:37.43]There are two more slots.
[324:39.17]I'm good to go.
[324:39.73]Okay.
[324:41.79]We're good.
[324:44.24]This is... I filled the party.
[324:45.92]All the slots are filled.
[324:46.82]That's seven population.
[324:49.20]And no money.
[324:50.22]But... Here's the thing.
[324:53.34]You take whatever you gain in population.
[324:58.30]And you can put more people into the pool of people you can potentially pull into the party.
[325:06.87]Wow.
[325:08.83]So, this is how you increase the amount of people that you can possibly have in the party.
[325:17.66]It goes up, it scales up.
[325:19.72]How to win this mode, you need four aliens in the party, and they're very expensive.
[325:27.43]So, look at all these people.
[325:29.27]They all have little things they do.
[325:30.95]The number in the bottom right is them either adding or subtracting money.
[325:39.77]So this person has three population, two cash.
[325:45.20]That's a lot.
[325:46.86]This person is minus one population +2 cash.
[325:51.28]We're looking for money.
[325:53.16]The dog is probably one of the best characters because the dog lets you, it's two population.
[325:57.43]And the dog lets you peek at who is coming through the door next.
[326:01.67]You can deny that person.
[326:03.15]You can literally throw them out and discard them.
[326:05.71]Think of these people as cards.
[326:08.97]Just say pop.
[326:10.57]Now I'm doing it to deliberately make people angry.
[326:12.39]I'm going to get a dog.
[326:15.33]Just because I want a dog.
[326:19.25]And I want to make some money.
[326:21.45]So we're going to add this person.
[326:24.45]This rich pal.
[326:26.28]Now there's people in the pool that are going to be making to add some cash.
[326:30.28]I'm probably going to buy this person.
[326:34.26]Monkey is good too.
[326:35.02]Monkey's great, yeah.
[326:36.54]Security is great because security can kick somebody out.
[326:39.62]Let's say that I get... I have two monkeys and one rock star in the pool.
[326:44.68]And I pull the two monkeys and I am terrified that if I hit A on the door again, I'm gonna pull this.
[326:50.31]I can kick out one of the troublemakers, whether it's one of the monkey or the rock star or who else has troublemaker?
[326:58.71]There's just regular troublemakers in the deck.
[327:02.27]Yeah, so wild buddy, you can kick him out.
[327:04.81]Kick out the wild buddy.
[327:05.95]You can just get rid of somebody and then you're still fine.
[327:11.77]So let's do another example here.
[327:15.14]So I've added a couple people.
[327:18.26]Dog.
[327:20.30]Now I can, I don't have to use it yet.
[327:22.78]I don't have to do it right now.
[327:25.04]That's bad to get.
[327:27.00]Okay, so that's $1.
[327:27.92]Okay, here's why the dog is very good.
[327:33.13]If I open this door and another person with the necks, another troublemaker comes through, I lose the round.
[327:39.71]You only have 24 rounds to get four aliens at the party.
[327:44.11]That's the fun.
[327:45.65]So let's go ahead and use the dog's power.
[327:47.71]Look at that.
[327:48.59]If I had pressed A, I would have been screwed.
[327:51.64]So we can say, get out of here.
[327:54.78]I can end the party now, or I can just roll the dice and try to pull somebody in.
[327:59.62]Which I'm going to do.
[328:01.20]So we're good.
[328:03.34]The dog is very good.
[328:05.66]And I have seven pop and one dollar.
[328:12.07]I'm going to pull.
[328:13.07]Yeah, I want some more money and I want some more pop.
[328:15.55]I want to be able to expand the house.
[328:21.35]Here we go.
[328:21.95]OK, OK, OK.
[328:27.84]This is going to be a money round.
[328:29.52]Yeah, perfect.
[328:30.20]That's great.
[328:30.54]That's actually the best thing that could happen.
[328:37.71]So now we upgrade the house.
[328:39.98]I'm going to do it twice.
[328:41.76]So now there's two more slots, which makes it harder, obviously, because you can pull more troublemakers.
[328:51.61]I want another dog.
[328:54.25]This guy's cool because he can pull in, he can fetch and pull in a specific person.
[329:07.05]See how the room's getting bigger?
[329:14.67]And you have a party full of dogs.
[329:16.15]You can have, you can buy with your pop four or five dogs.
[329:20.19]Alright.
[329:22.11]Not a great start.
[329:25.01]Okay.
[329:25.41]That's not terrible.
[329:27.39]This is good.
[329:29.87]We need to see.
[329:30.57]Alright.
[329:30.77]So I have two troublemakers.
[329:33.82]Okay, that's not good.
[329:34.68]So I physically can't... If I do this, I could boot this person or I could end the turn to make sure that I get this without losing.
[329:43.11]But we're a risk taker and I just did it.
[329:52.52]More room in the house.
[329:53.72]Okay.
[329:54.92]So, um...
[330:04.28]Dude's cool.
[330:07.84]This one's cool too.
[330:08.85]You lose one dollar if he's in the party.
[330:12.23]But if you fill up the whole thing without ending early, you get plus five pop and it's huge.
[330:17.63]I'm gonna get him.
[330:22.10]A lot of people are still coming and asking about the candle.
[330:31.26]Okay.
[330:34.34]Not good.
[330:41.28]Shit.
[330:42.57]Do I dare do it again?
[330:45.65]Yes!
[330:47.89]Okay.
[330:48.93]There we go.
[330:50.57]See?
[330:52.69]And now, I'm gonna lose a buck, but I'm gonna get another five pop.
[331:05.03]I kinda... Alright.
[331:06.71]I gotta start to figure out... It's actually really tricky.
[331:10.35]It takes a lot of... I mean, obviously the whole game's RNG.
[331:14.31]But... I have beaten this one once.
[331:22.66]You know what?
[331:23.02]Let's get a monkey.
[331:23.82]Let's get two monkeys and two security.
[331:30.04]Why not?
[331:36.83]It's basically just blackjack.
[331:39.41]Um... Well, it doesn't matter how many pop points I get.
[331:43.19]It just depends on not having three troublemakers.
[331:48.01]Okay, so he's here now.
[331:48.85]He can boot somebody out.
[331:54.38]Okay, this was a pretty good run.
[331:57.58]Good, that's perfect.
[332:01.56]Uh, do I... Okay, do I want to kick out somebody...
[332:06.01]I do.
[332:07.79]One of the one point Andes.
[332:14.21]And then it doesn't matter if it's a troublemaker because... Okay, yeah, so I got two points.
[332:19.40]Good.
[332:21.70]Kick himself out?
[332:22.48]I don't think you can.
[332:23.06]So then you just keep building and building and building until you have enough people to do some cool shit.
[332:38.72]This character is really cool because if you have all four out at the same time at the same party, you get plus 16 pop.
[332:47.63]So it's kind of hard to do that, but if you get enough of the drivers and enough kind of pull and booting and kicking people out, you can actually get four dancers and it's really cool.
[333:02.84]Let's get wild here.
[333:07.67]okay okay uh that was really risky but I don't care we can pull that I could just end it here or I could kick out one of the monkeys
[333:34.36]I didn't understand this one at all when I played it.
[333:37.15]Same here.
[333:37.69]When I first opened this, I was just like, I don't know.
[333:39.75]What is this?
[333:40.53]It's like a weird math strategy.
[333:43.65]I sat here for about five minutes and just kind of cared about it.
[333:46.61]And it became probably my favorite one in the whole collection.
[333:48.60]I'm going one more pull.
[333:52.58]One more.
[333:53.90]Alright.
[333:54.14]Well, that's a good indication.
[333:55.30]I wanted you to see that.
[333:57.87]Uh... So, I don't get any points this round.
[334:00.62]It's all ruined.
[334:01.84]And somebody has to be removed from your deck for, I think, the next couple of turns.
[334:07.18]So, let's get rid of this guy.
[334:11.38]Party got two out of hand.
[334:12.34]Three troublemakers.
[334:14.86]And here we go.
[334:17.50]Okay, this is interesting.
[334:20.12]So, let's... Um...
[334:29.35]Who's coming through the door?
[334:32.17]No, we don't want you.
[334:33.05]We don't.
[334:36.55]Wait, do we want you?
[334:37.47]No, we don't.
[334:44.13]I think I want the money.
[334:53.10]That's a pretty good round.
[334:55.14]That was a very good round, actually.
[335:01.59]Okay, let's do... I need $6 to upgrade again.
[335:07.50]The hippie is interesting because the hippie will cancel out one troublemaker.
[335:20.89]So one exit gets canceled out if a hippie is there.
[335:32.83]Okay, good.
[335:34.75]I would love to get rid of a couple of these.
[335:36.01]Okay.
[335:40.43]That's not a great round because it was a lot of just one point Andes.
[335:45.28]But it's okay.
[335:45.86]Stop saying Andy.
[336:04.90]Realistically, once I mean, at least for me, when you get to about 10 to 11 or 12 capacity, you don't really need to do very much more.
[336:14.31]I need money.
[336:21.88]I do.
[336:23.22]Um, I could do the DJ.
[336:29.58]This is good money.
[336:34.09]Auctioneer is good, but too expensive.
[336:37.67]Okay, let's see if we can get some good pulls here.
[336:49.19]That's bad.
[336:52.55]Okay, well, I'm going to have to pull a hippie or security guard.
[336:58.06]I'm going to pull a hippie because it's population.
[337:02.60]Okay, let's pull a... Another hippie.
[337:10.26]So now I don't have to worry about those two troublemakers.
[337:12.41]I can just pull.
[337:13.67]Good.
[337:15.19]Who's in the door?
[337:16.05]I... No.
[337:24.28]Eh, whatever.
[337:24.96]That guy's worth zero.
[337:36.16]Okay, I'll get an auctioneer.
[337:38.76]And another ticket taker.
[337:40.30]Let's go again.
[337:44.64]Looking for money.
[337:46.89]That's a great start.
[337:47.99]Oh, that's amazing.
[337:49.03]Wow!
[337:51.87]I'm not pushing my luck here.
[337:52.83]I'm ending it because that's a lot of money.
[338:00.23]That'll give me two or three more upgrades.
[338:06.25]OK, I can settle down on the money now.
[338:07.91]I'm going to save the pop.
[338:15.21]Wow.
[338:17.55]OK.
[338:23.43]I have to kick you out.
[338:27.85]Come on, really?
[338:28.63]Yeah.
[338:34.16]Okay.
[338:35.95]Do I dare?
[338:36.55]No, I don't.
[338:39.01]I have no idea what's the next in line, but I'm not going to do it.
[338:42.63]I want the money.
[338:43.09]Okay.
[338:51.56]I only have 13 rounds left.
[338:53.02]I need to really focus on Pop now.
[338:56.43]Let's go ahead and get Mr. Popular...
[339:01.08]Two Mr. Popular.
[339:01.84]Mr. Popular brings in another guest and I don't have to press the button.
[339:07.54]So you get two for one.
[339:15.11]I might regret that.
[339:25.25]okay that's kind of cool alright so I can bring in whoever three people I want so let's go ahead and pull what do I have one troublemaker I could do a monkey and then hippie monkey
[339:56.91]Oh no, I should get, uh, do I have any more of those guys with the, I don't.
[340:00.50]There we go.
[340:05.44]Okay.
[340:13.76]That is good.
[340:14.50]18 so far.
[340:15.22]Alright.
[340:16.02]I don't care about money right now.
[340:29.78]No more monkeys.
[340:36.03]I need a hippie.
[340:43.50]Okay, he brought dog.
[340:49.56]Dog?
[340:49.90]There's another dog at the door.
[340:53.12]Okay, so that's bad.
[340:57.57]But I need the pop so and I'm going to pull one more and I'm going to hope it's not next.
[341:02.36]God damn it.
[341:04.82]I got greedy.
[341:05.28]That would have been a good round too.
[341:19.22]I'm not doing anything.
[341:20.87]You don't want to overfill your deck either.
[341:23.69]I kind of already did, but you know it's OK.
[341:29.86]I want.
[341:33.32]That's good.
[341:35.18]Now we pull a hippie.
[341:42.98]And then I can pull one more.
[341:44.18]The party is overflow.
[341:48.96]Wait, what?
[341:53.46]Oh shit.
[341:53.96]I didn't know.
[341:54.36]I didn't even know that was possible.
[342:03.91]That's the first time I've seen that.
[342:05.49]Damn, okay.
[342:09.49]Already?
[342:11.97]Shit.
[342:15.74]No!
[342:17.52]I'm gonna lose.
[342:25.32]But it's really addicting.
[342:27.38]Because even if you do really well and pull a good... It really is just kind of throw dice in the air.
[342:31.59]It's a lot of fun, though.
[342:32.41]I love it.
[342:41.16]Okay, I gotta be careful.
[342:42.10]I have one hippie.
[342:49.42]Okay, so I can pull a... Do I have another monk?
[342:53.36]I do.
[342:53.54]I do have another monkey.
[342:54.80]Okay.
[342:59.73]That's pretty great.
[343:08.38]So here's the crazy part.
[343:11.08]It's not just buying four aliens.
[343:15.16]You have to have four aliens at a party.
[343:19.20]All in the same party to win.
[343:24.39]And as you see, we're not even close.
[343:26.83]It's really, really tricky.
[343:28.29]Let's see if I can get one.
[343:43.54]I don't want to kick anybody out.
[344:15.62]Hey, look at that.
[344:21.05]I can get an alien.
[344:27.41]Kick the driver out.
[344:28.27]I wanted a little bit more points.
[344:29.35]Alright, so now we have access to one alien is in the deck.
[344:32.29]Let's see if I can get one star.
[344:49.61]That's bad.
[344:52.83]Oh, I should have just ended it.
[344:53.79]I knew it.
[345:02.22]Alien is really completely useless unless you have four.
[345:05.36]Yeah, that's how they get you.
[345:10.98]So you really need to be peeking and pulling people out with the driver and it's a lot to it.
[345:19.64]Okay.
[345:22.32]Who's next?
[345:23.62]Oh, well there's the alien, but the alien doesn't do anything for us right now.
[345:28.12]He's just get rid of him, kick him out.
[345:41.07]He was not giving us any points and ta-da.
[345:51.20]I might get two.
[345:54.18]Maybe three if it goes really well here.
[345:55.76]I think we're just going to go with the... I probably should get more of the guy at the end where you get five pop if it's a full party.
[346:12.29]That's not good.
[346:13.57]Okay, we need to pull a hippie.
[346:19.74]Party is chilled out.
[346:20.72]Uh oh.
[346:22.10]Just gonna end it.
[346:36.35]It's the best restaurant I've ever been to.
[346:37.81]I don't know.
[346:43.37]There's a lot of great restaurants out there.
[346:51.47]Okay, who'd you bring?
[346:52.07]I don't love that.
[347:04.08]Damn it.
[347:14.36]Shit.
[347:14.98]Alright, you're not allowed in.
[347:18.50]I think I just have to do it.
[347:19.72]I can't.
[347:20.65]I have to do it.
[347:25.05]They don't mean fast food.
[347:26.09]I actually don't really even eat fast food that much recently.
[347:28.67]All the stomach and illness bullshit.
[347:32.21]I haven't had really anything that's not like quote clean.
[347:37.93]In like three months.
[347:39.53]Alien.
[347:55.03]We can kick the alien out if he doesn't give us anything here.
[348:02.10]Okay.
[348:05.32]No, you're not going to do anything for us at this point.
[348:13.40]How many do you have?
[348:14.14]I'm going to kick yourself out.
[348:16.93]Alright, and then you bring somebody and we'll end it there.
[348:21.93]Cool.
[348:26.12]You only eat soup or something?
[348:27.38]I mean, no, I... I eat crusty maggoty bread.
[348:36.68]Okay, I have one more round to get to... There's no way I'm going to get it.
[348:48.13]We have nothing but maggoty bread.
[348:50.03]We ate nothing but maggoty bread for three days.
[348:52.83]Three days.
[348:53.55]Hey, that's an old one.
[349:02.11]Shit.
[349:03.35]Shit!
[349:04.37]This is risky, what I'm doing.
[349:06.11]Oh!
[349:06.17]Okay, kick your... How many do we have?
[349:13.75]We have one, two... Okay, kick yourself out.
[349:17.75]And then you pull a high population person.
[349:33.74]That's going to be good.
[349:34.66]It's not going to be enough though.
[349:42.96]I have three aliens.
[349:43.96]It'll be a three star if I can get them.
[349:47.27]Final round.
[349:47.87]I want them to be able to kick themselves out.
[349:56.93]Okay, we need three aliens.
[349:58.05]Three star.
[349:59.47]No.
[350:05.07]Come on, bring an alien.
[350:06.91]No.
[350:08.13]No.
[350:09.27]You are not an alien, so leave.
[350:12.71]You are not an alien, so leave.
[350:16.87]You are bad, so leave.
[350:18.99]Alright, there's one.
[350:24.87]Two.
[350:27.04]Two star.
[350:33.10]And that's the game.
[350:33.74]That's how it works.
[350:36.76]Four stars is how to beat the experience.
[350:44.60]But here's the cool thing.
[350:46.44]That's challenging.
[350:47.44]That's kind of hard.
[350:50.84]There are different scenarios.
[350:55.40]That was pretty good.
[350:57.26]You would think, oh yeah, that's cute.
[350:59.40]Well, that's interesting.
[351:00.26]Well, what a fun little thing.
[351:02.46]Look at all this.
[351:04.69]There is five, I think, different scenarios with all different people.
[351:14.45]And they do different things.
[351:15.99]And it's like a fun little RNG puzzle, I guess.
[351:23.24]For each old friend, plus one pop, right?
[351:25.60]So, oh, maybe you'd want to... You know, when I talk about the one-point Andes.
[351:30.42]You'd want to, oh, get a bunch of these and then bring out the mascot.
[351:38.19]So it's pretty cool.
[351:44.24]I see that one.
[351:44.90]There's this group, this group.
[351:49.90]It's pretty fun.
[351:51.40]And then if you're feeling really frosty, it's random.
[351:58.75]So who knows?
[352:00.23]Well, that was not good.
[352:02.91]So it takes all the potential.
[352:06.84]And scrambles up and good luck trying to beat the random scenario.
[352:16.61]That person in chat said they were feeling frosty, so I would do this mode.
[352:19.23]See, this is just random.
[352:21.71]Now, obviously the scenarios that you looked at so far were very specific kind of metas and game styles, gameplay styles in mind.
[352:29.91]But good luck doing a random.
[352:35.53]I wonder this is probably how you get the cherry.
[352:39.05]Yeah, that's Party House.
[352:40.55]And it is the best one.
[352:43.47]Okay, so time to rate them.
[352:48.19]Am I allowed to put as many things as I want in different tiers?
[352:50.92]Oh my god.
[353:01.12]Oh my god, I probably have $10,000 now.
[353:09.17]Is it?
[353:12.11]Wait.
[353:13.61]Why do I have a cap?
[353:17.82]Look at all this meat too.
[353:18.90]Oh boy.
[353:19.48]Okay.
[353:19.94]What is going on with this cap bullshit?
[353:25.00]I can't even upgrade.
[353:26.18]What?
[353:40.10]I can almost do the upgrade for the yo-yo.
[353:43.58]150, right?
[353:54.54]I'm going to wait because I want the yo-yo because then I'm going to go... Yeah.
[353:59.57]Alright, give me one second.
[354:05.59]Because I'm taking five meats.
[354:07.59]And I'm going to go on a shopping spree.
[354:10.75]I need a silo.
[354:11.73]A silo is like, what, 50 ingots?
[354:26.41]Okay, well, it's going to be tough because I think I have like a top three.
[354:34.49]You did not see me play that whole third row.
[354:41.35]But the only one that I can really think that I'd really put high up there is probably the train heist one.
[354:47.81]Cowboy one.
[354:55.61]I guess I could just do this now.
[354:56.95]I want to get the damage upgrade.
[355:07.35]There we go.
[355:08.89]Alright.
[355:11.85]Metal yo-yo.
[355:16.27]Yeah, look at that.
[355:17.64]Okay, let's go kick some ass.
[355:23.46]Five meats.
[355:26.92]Place your bets, because after this, I'm leaving.
[355:29.75]Stream is over after this.
[355:34.10]I got like five to ten minutes here.
[355:37.56]I'm going up.
[355:39.30]I want to fight that big fucking guy.
[355:48.57]Rematch.
[356:00.26]Clear this first.
[356:12.77]Okay, come on.
[356:17.95]Oh, that's weird.
[356:23.63]Just spam.
[356:24.07]Just DPS.
[356:31.35]Just DPS.
[356:31.69]Let's go.
[356:36.55]Oh, I got time still.
[357:03.68]I want that chest over here.
[357:14.39]I killed the guy.
[357:15.81]I'm happy about it.
[357:16.35]Alright, I'm leaving.
[357:25.16]I thought he was going to drop more than just one Z coin.
[357:38.74]Two Z coins?
[357:39.82]What do I even do with these things?
[357:40.90]Okay, I'm out.
[358:14.15]I'm out.
[358:16.47]I'm outta here.
[358:17.83]I'm out.
[358:40.75]I'm gone, see?
[358:47.57]Hooray.
[358:53.54]Okay.
[358:55.02]I'll take the other meat.
[358:59.40]And... I can make another vent.
[359:01.68]How much is one of these?
[359:02.44]Okay.
[359:05.00]I don't have enough to do anything else.
[359:08.96]I spent all my ingots on this new toy.
[359:11.56]And that was probably a bad idea.
[359:16.48]But it's okay.
[359:22.78]I could build another one of these.
[359:30.96]Okay.
[359:31.24]I was going to say, do you get more shards if you have the better yo-yo?
[359:37.24]I don't think you do.
[359:38.44]Is it doing two instead of one?
[359:39.60]Hard to tell.
[359:47.25]I wonder if you get a better chance of getting ingots.
[359:52.92]I think I am getting more ingots.
[359:55.86]Let me get this to 20.
[359:57.62]So I can get another friend to work at that bench.
[360:00.09]And then I'm gonna turn it off.
[360:13.14]Yeah, that's UFO 50.
[360:14.34]It's really fun.
[360:15.00]I will give my ratings.
[360:16.86]I will give my S, A through B because I don't think anything truly is bad.
[360:23.34]I guess I could just do this till I get an ingot.
[360:53.13]Nine more, come on.
[361:03.25]You just don't want to stop.
[361:05.78]It's fun.
[361:13.92]What's the timing on the friends getting the ingots?
[361:16.94]Is it like once a minute?
[361:19.04]Once every three minutes or something?
[361:32.26]Get out of the way.
[361:34.52]Move out of the way.
[361:35.28]You drive me crazy.
[361:42.37]Depends on how much mayo you've eaten.
[361:43.87]Well, a lot.
[361:44.82]So is that a good, is that increase or decrease the chances?
[361:47.92]I don't know.
[362:10.08]Did you say Stardew is overrated?
[362:12.13]I don't think so.
[362:20.40]I think about Stardew all the time and how... That's one of those memory wipe games.
[362:26.60]A memory wipe game is... Yeah, I would... I would pay 50 bucks.
[362:33.09]Probably more than that, honestly.
[362:35.31]To get the Men in Black flash thing in my face.
[362:39.29]So I just never even... I just don't... It's like as if I never played it.
[362:44.78]I would do that with probably all the Dark Souls games.
[362:47.64]I would do that with Stardew Valley.
[362:52.32]Honestly, I'd probably do that with TF2.
[362:53.80]There's so much fun shit to discover in Team Fortress, with items and crafting and... A lot of the younger crowd, I know that this is said pretty frequently, of like, oh, you don't know how good you have it.
[363:11.85]You don't know, like, when I was your age, we had to do dial-up servers, which is true.
[363:18.81]Um...
[363:20.77]But there's so much great stuff that somebody right now has never played Team Fortress 2.
[363:29.41]Ever.
[363:31.41]And there's a whole... Think about how much time you may have spent in some of these games.
[363:36.07]And like television shows and experiences and books and... Oh, it's so cool that somebody has the opportunity to experience it for the first time.
[363:43.78]And it's still there.
[363:44.38]That's just awesome.
[363:45.82]It just is.
[364:04.41]Two more, come on.
[364:08.79]And then I'll do one more meat run.
[364:15.96]You don't know how good you had it.
[364:16.94]You're a lot older than a lot of people here.
[364:19.42]Trust me when I say.
[364:20.24]I know that I grew up.
[364:24.68]During probably the greatest.
[364:27.44]The greatest time of any media.
[364:29.97]The auto agrees.
[364:32.59]The video game revolution from.
[364:34.43]Like regular Nintendo through to where we are.
[364:38.69]Like I'd say like as of like five years ago.
[364:41.37]I saw the whole thing.
[364:42.73]And it was all new brand new.
[364:44.22]The whole thing was every time.
[364:47.28]Super Nintendo, all the classics from Super Nintendo to N64 to PlayStation 1.
[364:51.52]I grew up all the way through that and enjoyed it the whole time.
[364:56.50]So I definitely had a very blessed multimedia experience, let's call it that.
[365:18.52]Everybody thinks that their childhood was the best.
[365:22.90]I don't want to say the best as much as I want to say... It wasn't even childhood either, it was like teen years, like late teens.
[365:30.14]The Orange Box, I think was seriously probably the greatest thing that's ever been released.
[365:36.39]It just kind of was.
[365:38.21]And being, like, a late teen when the Orange Box came out... It's just... Like, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[365:47.35]Three of the things in the Orange Box are considered to be, like, three of the greatest games of all time.
[365:53.78]It's... And I was just... That was one product on the shelf that just came out one day.
[365:57.80]Oh, yeah, here it is.
[365:59.10]Half-Life 2, Team Fortress 2, and Portal...
[366:02.67]What?
[366:03.43]It was in one box.
[366:05.09]That was one release.
[366:07.01]Portal and TF2 were like a little, I don't want to even call them afterthoughts, but it was Half-Life 2 was the main thing in that box.
[366:15.00]Yeah, and it was not expensive either.
[366:16.72]It was like fucking $40 or something.
[366:19.36]It was like 50 bucks.
[366:26.71]So being able to know that you were around when that was considered to be a brand new thing.
[366:33.37]Nobody had any idea that they were going to be hats.
[366:39.00]Nobody had any idea that was going to happen.
[366:40.78]It was just, hey, this is really fucking awesome.
[366:43.06]This is amazing.
[366:44.44]What is this?
[366:45.74]I was a big TF Classic guy.
[366:46.86]I was a huge Team Fortress Classic guy.
[366:49.62]So when that came out and it was bundled with Half-Life 2 and Portal, it was...
[366:54.48]I didn't even care about Half-Life 2.
[366:55.88]I cared about TF2.
[366:59.08]By that point, those last five years before that, and when I was like 13, 12, 13, 14, Team Fortress Classic, I played it every day.
[367:10.45]After school.
[367:13.83]It was TF Classic and Diablo II.
[367:19.08]That was my 12 to... Let's call it like 12 to 18.
[367:25.78]Or 12 to 20.
[367:26.68]Like 13 to 20, really.
[367:27.90]I played it pretty much every day.
[367:31.89]You're a nerd.
[367:35.41]I mean, yeah.
[367:38.33]I'm pretty sure I always will be.
[367:40.15]I don't think that ever goes away.
[367:41.17]Oh, I told him.
[367:45.65]No, 1.6.
[367:45.79]I played 1.6, but I was so bad at it.
[367:50.00]Team Fortress Classic was one of those games where you didn't really matter if you were good.
[367:54.28]You could just run around disguised as an enemy sniper and just be a weirdo and just stab people.
[368:00.24]You just pick heavy and just hold the button down and attack.
[368:02.99]TF Classic was so accessible.
[368:04.85]Team Fortress is just so accessible to everybody.
[368:07.31]I think that's why it did so well.
[368:09.85]The skill ceiling on the Team Fortress games is so low and so high at the same time.
[368:16.16]I don't think anything will ever compare to that.
[368:18.66]I don't think there will ever be another release ever in human history where the skill ceiling of a video game is so low and so high at the same time.
[368:29.33]And the people that are low on the skill ceiling, that low on that kind of curve there, can still contribute and feel fulfilled in a game with a bunch of people that are really, really good.
[368:45.07]Nothing, I think, will ever compare to that.
[368:48.14]You could play Engineer, Medic, even sniping and stuff.
[368:53.58]Dude, Engineer is like my favorite class.
[368:57.10]Just being useful.
[368:58.72]TF2, didn't matter how bad or good you were at the game, you could always be useful.
[369:04.94]And that is, holy shit, that's something.
[369:21.38]If you were bad at Battlefield, you were literal fodder.
[369:25.21]Yeah, guess what?
[369:25.77]I was bad at Battlefield, and I was literal fodder.
[369:28.01]I was the guy that just threw an ammo crate and then died.
[369:38.86]The difference between the ceiling and the foot.
[369:40.62]Yeah.
[369:42.12]And it's big in TF2.
[369:43.20]You can be really good at that game.
[369:46.14]You could be the most try-hard, 10 million kill scattergun scout.
[369:51.33]You turn the corner to a sentry gun, you are going to lose.
[369:57.43]And that guy that you died to might have a Gibbous on.
[370:01.87]And it probably has his controls backwards.
[370:04.57]And he still can contribute and have fun.
[370:20.23]And I know Team Fortress is my... That's my shit.
[370:23.07]That's my... That's my jam.
[370:25.27]All the way back to... Like, what?
[370:28.35]1997.
[370:30.33]The game is pretty much the same.
[370:32.67]Not... Here's the thing.
[370:33.83]Not a whole lot changed from Classic to TF2.
[370:36.68]Really not a whole lot.
[370:37.54]They just made it better.
[370:39.98]Level 1, Level 2, Level 3 Sentry, The Spy, The Sniper, The Demoman, The Pyro.
[370:44.52]Everything is pretty much the same.
[370:46.16]So...
[370:51.62]They kind of just made TF Classic just a way upgraded version, and I don't think they're ever going to do it again.
[370:58.62]I don't think you can do much past TF2.
[371:00.74]I don't think they know that.
[371:07.36]But it doesn't need to.
[371:08.26]I don't think it needs to be done.
[371:11.24]You know what?
[371:11.58]Let's go hot take mode here.
[371:13.42]We're in a world right now where I think a lot of people, a lot of developers, a lot and even a lot of gamers to a lot of us.
[371:21.20]We don't need to have another one.
[371:22.48]You know what I mean?
[371:24.92]Like, it doesn't have to be there.
[371:26.84]It can just be what it is.
[371:27.80]A Source 2 port, or like a Source 3 eventually port, and you know, quality of life, I get it.
[371:41.63]But the second that you change how the particles land on the flamethrower in like Team Fortress 3, you may have ruined the whole game.
[371:50.49]Valve is not stupid.
[371:51.59]Valve is honestly probably one of the best game development studios that exist.
[371:57.44]Because they know that if that scattergun feels different in TF3, it ruins the whole game.
[372:08.81]He's like, what are you talking about?
[372:13.43]If the Demoman's sticky launcher feels even a tenth different, it would probably just... Eh, I'm not feeling it.
[372:22.10]And they know that.
[372:29.94]They weren't stupid.
[372:31.10]Deadlock is... I'm not really into Deadlock as much as it looks cool.
[372:37.65]I just don't know.
[372:38.25]I'm not a big MOBA guy.
[372:39.25]I just never was.
[372:40.47]Smite was fun, but...
[372:42.88]I gotta be honest, Smite 2, let's go, we're going hot takes right now.
[372:47.60]Smite 2?
[372:48.30]Mato's like, you need to stop what you're doing and pay attention to me.
[372:54.27]Smite 2 doesn't look very good.
[372:56.63]Am I crazy?
[372:57.49]It looks like, I don't know, it looks weird.
[373:03.61]They went to Unreal 5 and it looks, it looks like shiny and like wet.
[373:08.24]Every character looks wet.
[373:10.81]It's like the saturation and the shine is too high on everything.
[373:14.07]No, I'm definitely not crazy.
[373:25.69]Let me preface this by saying I haven't played it.
[373:29.13]I haven't really had time to sit down and kind of do it.
[373:32.79]But I've watched a bunch of footage of people playing it, and I've watched people stream it.
[373:37.67]And it just looks like all the characters are shiny.
[373:41.15]And it looks better, but worse at the same time.
[373:46.85]Go get your meat.
[373:52.28]He's like, please talk to me.
[373:54.30]What do you need?
[373:54.64]Do you need something?
[373:55.98]Alright, I'm gonna go anyways.
[373:59.56]Every Unreal 5 game looks the same?
[374:04.34]Yeah, I... Am I just one of those people that I'm getting older and the better the graphics get, the more that I go... I wish there was more polygons on this.
[374:15.57]Or less, sorry, less polygons is what it would be, right?
[374:20.08]I liked it when there were triangles that were visible.
[374:25.76]But I haven't played, the game could be incredible.
[374:28.24]Like the actual video game could be amazing, but I just kind of, the look just isn't really doing it for me.
[374:36.41]I mean, I'm a big Smite guy.
[374:37.49]I was a big Smite fan.
[374:38.31]I love that game.
[374:39.65]I'm sure I would love the game.
[374:40.93]Probably play it eventually.
[374:44.11]See if I'm full of shit or not.
[374:48.29]Okay, Otto, I'm coming.
[374:49.31]Don't worry, Mr. Good Boy.
[374:52.22]Alright, guys, I'll see you later.
[374:54.44]I'll probably see you in, let's call it maybe like another week or two from now.
[375:02.04]Like what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to do this like once every seven to 10 days, like two or three streams a month.
[375:11.84]That's kind of where I'm like thinking like I'm kind of into it right now.
[375:15.88]So, okay.
[375:17.46]I know, I know he wants a cookie.
[375:22.73]So maybe like middle of next week or something.
[375:27.04]Possibly.
[375:29.32]Keep an eye on the sus.
[375:30.82]I will update it.
[375:32.24]Also, important to get this out there too.
[375:35.04]Today is the day all of you Discord viewers and a lot of you right now just went, shit, he remembered.
[375:40.74]A lot of you maybe were hoping that I forgot, which you had very, very good reason to think that.
[375:48.92]Tonight, the Discord is going into the broadcast mode, which if you're not aware, that means that after a few hours after the stream ends, the 24-7 chatting channels in the Discord are going to be locked.
[376:05.16]And the only ones that will be open from here on out are on stream days, and it's going to be the stream and substream channels will be open.
[376:16.70]So you got your last few hours here of chatting in the Discord, at least on a non-broadcast day.
[376:28.69]There's a Discord?
[376:29.75]Hey, dude, no.
[376:31.65]Don't even worry about it.
[376:35.03]Just pretend like I didn't say anything.
[376:36.67]The guy that just said that.
[376:43.54]It's not closing.
[376:44.18]It's just going to be open during broadcast days or broadcast periods.
[376:48.67]If I stream more than once in like a couple days, it's just going to stay open.
[376:52.65]There's no reason to close it.
[376:53.47]But I got to go.
[376:54.11]I got to take care of Otto.
[376:54.99]He needs to either go out.
[376:56.09]No, he just went out like an hour ago, two hours ago.
[377:02.46]Yeah, tonight's the night.
[377:04.64]I'll see you all.
[377:06.26]I'll update the sus probably in like a week or so.
[377:08.42]I'll get a concrete day in the next probably four or five days.
[377:12.74]UFO 50, definitely.
[377:14.20]I didn't even do my tier list, but they're all great.
[377:17.42]You know the ones that I love.
[377:20.99]That's going to be it.
[377:22.05]Take care of yourselves.
[377:23.15]Have a great rest of your evening.
[377:24.77]And see you soon.
[377:27.51]Take care.
[380:19.09]you
[380:53.97]Thank you.
