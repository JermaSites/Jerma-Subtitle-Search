[00:01.77]That's all the money I have?
[00:03.55]That seems pretty terrible.
[00:07.89]Whoa, what the fuck was that?
[00:09.73]What's going on?
[00:10.27]Stop doing that!
[00:10.79]The game's like, crashing.
[00:15.77]You're gonna play Stardew Valley for another six hours?
[00:17.75]I- No, I can't.
[00:19.45]Maybe an hour tops.
[00:26.53]What am I doing in my bed?
[00:27.57]Alright, what was I doing?
[00:31.74]Alright, hold on a second.
[00:32.44]I'm taking my clothes off.
[00:36.98]It's really odd in here.
[00:42.94]Everybody calm down.
[00:43.82]I just had to do that for a second.
[00:54.43]What was I even doing?
[00:55.35]Does this seem louder to anybody else?
[01:00.76]Seems louder to me.
[01:01.48]Yeah, it is.
[01:04.90]Okay.
[01:13.69]Uh, deeper in the mine.
[01:16.41]What did I have out here?
[01:17.23]I had... These are not ready.
[01:27.28]Did I already water them?
[01:29.54]No.
[01:36.91]Show the ladies my chiseled, naked chest.
[01:40.97]I don't think so.
[01:43.46]I do not think so.
[01:44.32]I need to get more plants.
[01:50.00]Wait, hold on a second.
[01:51.02]Please tell me this is the guy telling me my shit's ready to be picked up, right?
[01:57.68]No, this is telling me about the flower dance thing.
[02:00.00]That I don't care about.
[02:04.77]Why does my game keep doing that?
[02:08.59]Stop doing that game.
[02:09.37]Okay.
[02:12.25]Alright, I think it's gonna- One last time, and then it shouldn't happen again.
[02:23.50]I hope it won't.
[02:29.97]Odd.
[02:32.43]ODD!
[02:36.29]Do I have, like, a program open in the background or something?
[02:38.39]What do I have open?
[02:45.83]I think we're gonna do some mine stuff.
[02:51.74]Yeah, I'm doing some mining shit.
[02:52.94]I'm gonna get that out of the way.
[03:02.88]Okay, I closed a pro- There was a program open in the background for some weird reason.
[03:07.97]Alright, let's go.
[03:10.29]Let's mine.
[03:10.87]Because I need to wait one more day.
[03:15.21]I just want to get the axe and break the stupid thing.
[03:24.56]I need to know what's inside of that.
[03:26.36]And then I can go to bed peacefully.
[03:35.04]Where's the blacksmith down there?
[03:38.97]He said two days, right?
[03:45.43]Should be two days by now.
[03:46.53]There's a little choo-choo train set.
[03:49.24]Get out of the way.
[03:52.74]Is it done?
[03:53.12]Ugh, you stupid asshole.
[04:03.32]I need to waste another day.
[04:04.34]Do I have my fishing pole?
[04:07.34]Of course I don't.
[04:09.28]So we're going to the mine.
[04:10.02]See if I can get some more stuff.
[04:13.37]Or should I just go back to bed?
[04:18.65]I think it's bedtime.
[04:19.61]It's 10am.
[04:24.51]That's a good enough time to go to sleep.
[04:33.84]I can make iron too.
[04:34.78]I really should do that.
[04:40.66]I just want to crack open the asteroid.
[04:43.79]That's it.
[04:51.47]My dog is snoring over here.
[05:01.19]Make a diamond pickaxe.
[05:02.21]I don't have access to that at the moment.
[05:07.64]I don't even have my pickaxe on the character.
[05:10.87]What a disaster.
[05:14.27]Why do I not have that on?
[05:15.95]What a disaster.
[05:19.57]Son of a bitch.
[05:20.85]Why would I not even have that?
[05:23.83]Just give me the turnip.
[05:30.88]Have I been in this person's house?
[05:31.90]2 p.m.
[05:36.34]Actually, I think I have to go in here.
[05:45.25]Okay, let's kill... Let's kill an hour so I can go in the Adventurer's Guild.
[05:48.59]That's what that is, right?
[05:50.03]Yeah.
[05:55.65]Bridge don't work.
[06:02.73]Man, how do I take the drugs that makes my character fall asleep for four days?
[06:07.53]They have to exist, right?
[06:11.70]Who opens at 2 p.m.? ?
[06:15.17]What kind of psychopath opens a store at 2 o'clock in the afternoon?
[06:25.47]And what do these things do?
[06:26.51]I'm trying to figure that out as well.
[06:30.98]What do I use?
[06:31.48]I use a Corsair keyboard.
[06:33.16]I'm not exactly sure of the exact name.
[06:35.92]But it's from Corsair.
[06:38.92]It's a red switch keyboard, I believe.
[06:40.88]Mechanical.
[06:48.76]wait mode no just give me the drugs I'll be like I can craft them right almost time I'm gonna be the creep and sit outside his house again
[07:14.78]Oh, I can teleport to those statues later.
[07:16.46]That is really cool.
[07:17.68]I hope I learn that soon.
[07:20.90]Corsair K70?
[07:21.54]I don't think it's a K70.
[07:22.32]Let me see exactly what it is.
[07:23.64]It is a Corsair.
[07:24.78]It just says Corsair Gaming on it.
[07:28.30]It doesn't say, like, a number.
[07:29.24]I don't know exactly.
[07:32.08]I got it a long time ago.
[07:39.45]Sneakers, ring.
[07:42.05]This trident I have is way better than the wooden blade.
[07:48.27]Okay.
[07:50.69]Come back when you got something to show me, kid.
[07:53.25]Okay.
[07:54.88]Monster eradicate... Really?
[07:57.16]Help us keep the... 23 out of 1,000 slimes?
[08:03.60]I have to kill 1,000 slimes before this guy will talk to me.
[08:06.42]Holy shit.
[08:11.07]I did donate the egg, didn't I?
[08:12.59]Oh, I still have it.
[08:13.39]What?
[08:14.43]I thought I did that when I turned the stream off last...
[08:20.32]So I guess that's the Adventurer's Guild.
[08:21.98]Come back when you kill a thousand enemies.
[08:25.20]Okay, well, I guess I didn't go through when I donated this last time.
[08:28.41]Didn't save, probably.
[08:30.27]So we're going to do it again.
[08:37.45]Hopefully when the next day turns by, I can actually break the stupid thing in the front lawn.
[08:50.71]What do I think of Stardew Valley?
[08:55.67]I think it's great.
[08:56.13]It's definitely just a relaxing game just to chill and get lost in and just have fun.
[09:04.88]And for 15 bucks, there's a shitload of content in this game.
[09:08.54]There's a lot.
[09:21.67]Hello.
[09:31.00]I wish I was just gifted that to her.
[09:32.04]That would have been so horrible.
[09:36.26]Jerma, have a great night and may all of your dreams come true, or at least some.
[09:39.09]Well, yours too, Mr. Zebra.
[09:42.11]Have a good night.
[09:42.73]Thanks for coming.
[09:55.71]I've played Terraria for maybe a total of three hours.
[10:00.04]Actually, I'm not a big fan of the... I wasn't a huge fan.
[10:07.70]It was fun, but it didn't really grab me.
[10:14.57]Donate this.
[10:17.59]Over here.
[10:20.05]Yeah, I already did this.
[10:20.75]He gave me a bunch of seeds.
[10:23.98]Yeah, see?
[10:26.14]Well, okay.
[10:30.82]Time to go home.
[10:32.28]I can actually plant these seeds.
[10:34.08]All of them.
[10:37.13]Am I going to keep streaming?
[10:37.97]You better believe it.
[10:40.71]I'm going to be trying more quality settings tomorrow as well.
[10:44.79]We're going to try to push my internet to its maximum and see if I can get the stream even higher quality.
[10:53.13]Because it kind of... I mean, it has sort of been... Hey, whoop, don't want to go that way.
[10:58.25]I've been streaming a shitload.
[10:59.21]Just the last, like, eight or nine days.
[11:03.38]Maybe five plus hours a day, right?
[11:05.96]Besides a couple days in a row there.
[11:08.80]This has been very much a trial run for me.
[11:11.60]To make sure I can not only A, stream consistently.
[11:16.06]At a, at least somewhat decent bitrate.
[11:20.04]But, you know, me turn it on and actually stream.
[11:23.94]So it's been a double trial period, so I'm going to up the settings again tomorrow.
[11:29.15]And we're going to see what happens.
[11:34.43]I can't guarantee it's going to work.
[11:37.15]So hopefully tomorrow night when I stream, it's not a total lag fest and I have to just quit.
[11:42.98]And go back to original settings.
[11:50.66]Do I have any fertilizer?
[11:52.94]No, but whatever.
[11:53.92]I'm just gonna plant them all.
[12:10.48]Make more emotes.
[12:13.40]You know, the whole nine yards.
[12:19.56]I have ten up.
[12:21.12]But it's ten up on paper.
[12:22.60]It's not actually really ten up.
[12:24.10]It's more like six.
[12:26.25]And it's very inconsistent.
[12:35.75]Can I get these yet?
[12:38.15]These are so close to being done.
[12:39.38]You know, I kind of want to just go back to bed again.
[12:45.81]Water these and go back to sleep and hopefully my sword is done.
[12:49.33]My axe.
[12:49.77]Yeah, it's concast.
[12:56.20]So, you know.
[12:58.08]They're very, very... Hit or miss.
[13:10.09]Okay, give the dog some water.
[13:16.73]I got you, boy!
[13:17.59]There you go, good boy.
[13:19.11]What time tomorrow I'm gonna stream?
[13:26.10]I wanna make a video tomorrow.
[13:28.70]Something I've been putting off for like the last four days straight.
[13:44.92]I actually might up the CPU thing in OBS.
[13:49.18]Make it, like, faster, faster, whatever.
[13:50.86]See if that helps a little bit with the quality.
[13:54.82]Maybe go up to, like, 3400 bitrate.
[13:56.26]Alright, this asshole, please have my pickaxe.
[14:03.85]And you've had, like, four days to work on it.
[14:05.75]What do you mean it's locked?
[14:14.28]I have to wait again because it's not open.
[14:18.16]Get out of here, you birds.
[14:25.27]Stream 60 FPS.
[14:26.45]I'm not... I really don't think my computer can handle it.
[14:30.49]I have a 4770K and a 780.
[14:34.32]And there are some times I can even feel it struggling a little bit.
[14:43.94]church ain't even open oh my god the dance the forest dance where's the dance that's where everybody's everybody's doing a dance I'm missing the dance in the forest where is this dance
[15:10.65]I'm just aimlessly walking around town.
[15:12.35]And then having a prom going on.
[15:26.34]Can I take the bus?
[15:27.12]I don't even know where this is supposed to be going on.
[15:35.15]Up there?
[15:35.51]Maybe up there?
[15:47.06]Can I make it up there?
[15:47.90]I'm gonna have to clear this shit.
[15:54.74]Dog, what are you doing up here?
[16:04.21]West of town and south of the farm.
[16:07.81]Really, this is backwoods.
[16:09.01]I figured it would be in, like, over here.
[16:19.63]Also, I'm thinking about getting some computer upgrades here.
[16:23.25]Watch out, dog.
[16:29.28]I want to get a 980.
[16:31.44]And maybe switch out my motherboard and get one of the new 6000 series Intel chips.
[16:49.57]That's not going to happen for at least another couple months at least.
[16:57.04]Is this the dance?
[16:57.66]Am I in time?
[16:59.64]Oh, look it.
[17:07.03]I made it to the dance.
[17:13.11]Tub of flowers.
[17:13.75]I don't have any money for anything.
[17:19.50]Can I just be really anti-social and leave?
[17:21.20]I don't even want to be... Oh my god!
[17:23.22]This is the person I had to meet.
[17:29.61]Uh... Hold on a second.
[17:30.77]Can I be my dance partner?
[17:31.99]I gotta pick a dance partner.
[17:34.55]This is really important.
[17:40.62]Uh... I don't know.
[17:44.48]Where's Pam?
[17:44.92]Pam?
[17:47.36]Pam?
[17:49.41]There she is.
[17:49.81]Alright, let's dance.
[17:55.08]Come on.
[17:55.70]I want you to be my date.
[17:58.36]Oh, God.
[17:58.78]Alright.
[17:59.18]Okay, you look like you're standing here by yourself.
[18:02.64]You don't look like you're with anybody.
[18:05.22]Will you be my dance partner?
[18:06.58]Did she say you?
[18:08.90]She said you, no.
[18:10.71]You, no.
[18:12.69]What?! !
[18:17.03]Uh, will you be my dance partner?
[18:19.25]No, thanks.
[18:24.89]Will you be my dance partner?
[18:27.63]No.
[18:30.97]Hey guys, will you be my dance partner?
[18:32.95]Um... Uh...
[18:43.70]Nobody wants to dance with me.
[18:46.17]I know you're with your boyfriend here, but can you be my dance partner?
[18:52.09]Everybody hates my guts.
[18:54.17]What about you?
[18:56.25]Come on, Elliot.
[19:03.06]Willie.
[19:03.50]Come on, Willie.
[19:04.14]You might be like a stinky guy with a fishing pole, but...
[19:09.65]Oh, no.
[19:10.77]What about you?
[19:12.19]Sam, you gotta be... Come on.
[19:14.41]Maybe next year?
[19:15.40]No one's gonna dance with me.
[19:24.00]Come on, Abigail.
[19:24.74]Alright, what about the old lady?
[19:30.88]It's gonna be the old lady.
[19:33.54]She'll be like, oh, yeah, poor little Sunny needs a date.
[19:36.75]Okay, what about old guy?
[19:41.85]I'm running out of options here, guys.
[19:46.22]Going both ways.
[19:50.02]Male and female.
[19:56.34]I've asked every single person, what about the hermit?
[20:04.03]Nope.
[20:07.13]Come on, Harvey.
[20:10.46]No, you don't.
[20:11.00]You don't have any plans.
[20:13.76]Shut up.
[20:20.21]I think I'm really out of options.
[20:21.71]Every single person said no.
[20:24.09]The last person is the guy behind the counter that's selling stuff.
[20:27.37]He won't even say anything.
[20:32.46]Am I just gonna be standing on the sidelines?
[20:33.92]This is gonna be depressing.
[20:41.04]I'm just gonna go home.
[20:41.88]Damn, I'm going home.
[20:48.76]Screw it.
[20:50.87]Fuck your dance party.
[20:51.83]I got better things to do.
[20:55.63]Like smash an asteroid in my front lawn.
[21:02.31]Yeah.
[21:03.27]Enjoy your party.
[21:07.13]Punks.
[21:14.33]Banging party, that was.
[21:15.55]Am I stuck here?
[21:18.49]They won't even let me escape my shame.
[21:20.90]I'm stuck here.
[21:26.70]Yeah, I'm locked in.
[21:29.32]I can not leave.
[21:30.52]I can't even go home and open up a pint of Haagen-Dazs and eat the whole thing.
[21:40.81]I have to just be embarrassed and depressed the whole time over here.
[21:43.97]That's great.
[21:47.05]How do I make this stop?
[21:54.35]Come on.
[21:57.59]Who makes this happen?
[21:58.89]Mayor Lewis, can you please?
[22:00.11]Yeah, start the dance.
[22:02.36]Go.
[22:03.06]Fine.
[22:05.06]Jeez.
[22:12.16]Okay, if I knew we were going to be dressed like dickheads, I'm glad I didn't say yes to doing it.
[22:17.98]If I knew we were going to be dressed like this, I'm glad I'm on the sidelines.
[22:21.18]Can I just go in and ruin it?
[22:26.37]Where am I?
[22:26.69]No, I'm up here in the corner.
[22:44.10]Yay.
[22:44.54]Yay.
[22:45.98]That was fun.
[22:47.16]Oh, wow.
[22:52.67]What a fun day.
[22:53.61]See, I got my dog.
[22:56.77]Just like in real life.
[22:57.55]Me and my dog.
[22:59.21]See, he loves me.
[23:09.94]That was shit.
[23:10.64]That was total shit.
[23:17.61]That was really dumb.
[23:22.33]Yeah, that wasn't even dancing.
[23:23.23]They were just looking at each other and the girls were curtsying and the boys were just standing there like scarecrows.
[23:28.33]I wanna do some dancing.
[23:31.12]I was promised a dance.
[23:41.50]How's my TV dog hybrid?
[23:42.71]He's pretty good.
[23:44.37]Runnin' in the trees.
[23:47.08]Being a total fucking moron.
[23:50.10]He's good.
[23:51.74]He's good.
[23:54.30]Let me at least take some tools this time.
[23:57.16]The axe.
[24:02.24]Fishing.
[24:02.68]And... Where's my pickaxe?
[24:15.63]Did I give the pickaxe to that guy?
[24:17.41]So now he can't... Bunch of shit.
[24:25.53]So I can't even do anything.
[24:31.77]Okay.
[24:32.53]Whatever.
[24:32.85]That shit better be done!
[24:44.66]I just... I wanted to turn the stream off after I broke the asteroid, and I thought that was going to take 10 minutes.
[24:53.34]We had to watch a shitty dance that I couldn't even participate in.
[24:57.85]And this guy is just lazily working on my stuff.
[25:00.31]Do I have any daffodils?
[25:05.83]Maybe.
[25:06.81]But I don't care.
[25:10.33]Okay.
[25:10.69]Let's check on him again.
[25:16.74]You flirting techniques are clearly flawed.
[25:20.86]That they are.
[25:22.08]That they are.
[25:23.66]You are correct on that one.
[25:35.29]We sit out here for 20 minutes.
[25:36.75]Go through his trash.
[25:38.03]Why don't we just break his ship?
[25:43.70]He'd have to come out here.
[25:44.30]He's gonna be like, what happened to this car?
[25:45.70]This is a confounded machine.
[25:47.34]Oh, a daffodil.
[25:51.30]I can do that now.
[25:55.54]I have played BioShock.
[25:58.06]I've played BioShock Infinite.
[26:03.06]There we go, finally.
[26:05.49]Took you long enough.
[26:10.92]Steel pickaxe is 5,000 gold and 5 iron bars.
[26:16.94]See if I can get rid of that thing in the front lawn.
[26:18.79]That would sure be swell.
[26:37.08]Hey there.
[26:40.29]Yeah, thanks for dancing with me.
[26:44.17]I'm right here.
[26:45.01]I might as well... Who needs the daffodils?
[26:55.43]I bet you need to steal one to open... That would suck.
[26:57.58]Because that means that's going to be in the front lawn for a long time.
[27:01.80]I think I'm going the right way.
[27:09.16]Yeah, I think so.
[27:14.84]Lots of potholes in this town.
[27:26.85]Alright, let's do it.
[27:28.59]Let's break open this thing that we've been waiting so long for.
[27:51.80]Hi.
[27:52.20]Hello.
[27:52.82]How are you?
[28:03.09]Hey, Mortal Kombat?
[28:06.45]I don't think I'm going to play Mortal Kombat.
[28:10.19]What was the game I played that was like 30 seconds and it was super loud, started with a Z?
[28:14.47]That was Zemarian.
[28:15.03]Zemarian.
[28:27.63]So a question, the stream, the stream quality, right?
[28:35.09]Has the stream quality since yesterday gone up?
[28:42.36]Because if the answer is no, then I don't, there's no reason for me to use more of my CPU.
[28:48.92]Quick question.
[28:53.82]If you guys tell me, there's really no discernible difference.
[28:56.51]It was fine yesterday.
[29:04.11]Wasn't bad before.
[29:07.19]Looks like it.
[29:13.91]Haven't really noticed a difference.
[29:15.13]Basically the same.
[29:17.27]Because if I can avoid having to use a shitload of my CPU...
[29:26.64]Doesn't seem that much of a difference.
[29:27.78]Can't really tell.
[29:30.20]Well, whatever.
[29:31.66]If I can keep running like this, then it doesn't bother me.
[29:36.23]What the hell?
[29:37.23]This thing has gotten weirder.
[29:38.17]This thing has tendrils growing out of it now.
[30:05.42]Nice tendrils.
[30:13.07]Okay.
[30:15.79]What do you say?
[30:16.57]Oh, shit.
[30:17.61]I just knocked up my gravel path.
[30:19.13]My beautiful gravel path.
[30:22.11]What's on the list?
[30:26.75]Still one person I need to meet.
[30:29.81]Do I read chat?
[30:30.43]Of course I do.
[30:34.97]Of course I do.
[30:38.13]Give me my watering can and let's start the day.
[30:40.24]For real.
[30:44.54]Watering can.
[30:46.72]Excellent.
[30:55.05]Should I get an animal farm?
[31:10.05]I'm contemplating going into town and getting an animal farm.
[31:13.67]That sounds like fun to me.
[31:18.97]I just looked over and saw the Earth.
[31:20.18]I was like, what the fuck is that?
[31:22.74]I forgot I had that.
[31:23.82]I forgot I made that emote.
[31:26.52]I actually just didn't even know what it was for a second.
[31:29.18]And then I realized, oh yeah, that's the Earth.
[31:30.34]Of course it is.
[31:37.82]Um, I'm gonna go to town.
[31:48.73]What's the quest today?
[31:51.23]The monsters known as slime are throwing the elemental balance into disarray.
[31:55.14]I would like an adventurer to enter the mines and slay four easy.
[31:57.92]Okay.
[31:58.36]My god, that's the easiest thing you'd have me do all day.
[32:00.20]I'll go do it right now.
[32:03.22]Just go kill four slimes in the mine.
[32:05.28]Easy.
[32:13.89]I have to cross the bridge because I don't think I'm going to be in the right spot.
[32:19.55]Oh, Earth to Jerma.
[32:20.97]Earth to Jerma, hello, are you there?
[32:25.91]You'll always be loyal to the original.
[32:31.38]Well, just you wait till Jupiter comes out.
[32:35.58]Jupiter, uh, Jupiter's kind of ridiculous, I think.
[32:39.47]If it actually, if you can actually see it,
[32:44.26]My fear is you won't be able to see it.
[32:46.44]And I'm trying to figure out how to make it so you can see it.
[32:50.42]But, uh... I like Jupiter.
[32:53.46]Alright, four slimes.
[32:59.28]Easy as pie.
[33:01.06]I also have a better pickaxe, so... I wonder if that's gonna yield me better returns on my investments.
[33:13.38]So what down here could I not hit with this before?
[33:16.08]You know what I mean?
[33:19.50]Was there something I actually couldn't hit down here?
[33:33.42]The Jerma Death Star.
[33:36.92]No, that's not technically a planet.
[33:40.72]Where are the slimes?
[33:43.09]There's a slime.
[33:45.01]Two for the price of one.
[33:52.42]I have a lot of just garbage in my inventory right now for no reason.
[34:00.08]This was the easiest quest I've had to do.
[34:04.52]Done.
[34:05.36]Oh, sneakers!
[34:07.74]Sneakers!
[34:11.08]Plus one defense.
[34:13.55]These are better.
[34:14.93]I'll give these to Grandpa.
[34:21.85]Slay monsters, right?
[34:22.87]Talk to the wizard.
[34:26.15]That was the easiest 160 gold I think I've done this whole game.
[34:40.90]Amethyst.
[34:41.74]Beautiful.
[34:45.36]Yeah, why did that slime have sneakers?
[34:46.48]That made no sense.
[34:48.34]Slimes don't need sneakers.
[34:49.50]They're slimes.
[34:50.24]Why would you need to wear shoes?
[34:59.82]I need to make torches too.
[35:01.30]I forgot you could do that.
[35:12.45]Ah, relaxing.
[35:14.67]Hitting stuff with an axe.
[35:21.84]I want more Geodudes.
[35:24.94]I like when they break them open.
[35:26.28]It's like opening a box.
[35:36.34]No, actually, right before the stream ended yesterday, I got my copper pickaxe.
[35:41.96]I'm just curious as to why I did it, because it doesn't seem like I needed to do that for any reason.
[35:47.93]At least yet.
[35:50.23]The reason I did it was because an asteroid landed in my front lawn.
[35:54.57]And I thought I could mine it, because it told me, oh, your pickaxe isn't strong enough to mine this.
[35:57.44]So I, you know, did what I did.
[36:00.54]Turns out it didn't matter.
[36:01.44]Is this gold?
[36:05.86]No, it's topaz.
[36:10.56]That was a really depressing last 10 minutes of the stream, by the way, yesterday, last night.
[36:14.72]You guys remember what happened, right?
[36:17.72]Those of you that were here.
[36:20.53]Nobody wanted to dance with me at the prom.
[36:25.15]Every single person in town hates me.
[36:27.45]And nobody wanted to dance with me, so I just was sad.
[36:29.57]And then I went home and my meteor was still there and I couldn't break it.
[36:33.46]It was very sad.
[36:34.86]It was not cool.
[36:40.18]I'm running out of energy.
[36:40.86]Do I have any food?
[36:44.12]Yes, I do.
[36:48.46]I can eat this, but no.
[36:50.15]I'm going to have to return to the surface very shortly.
[37:03.79]In fact, I might have to go right now.
[37:07.10]Can I at least break these?
[37:07.94]Okay, I can finally break the big chunks.
[37:10.74]Oh my goodness, that was a lot.
[37:19.14]Yeah, it's time to go.
[37:20.95]It's time to go.
[37:21.51]How do I get over there?
[37:41.27]I wish a meteor would land on my farm.
[37:44.23]Does that happen to everybody?
[37:45.27]Or did that just happen to me for no reason?
[37:46.75]That has to happen to everybody, right?
[38:00.43]Yeah, Pam's a 3 out of 10 right now.
[38:08.38]She's the only person with any hearts on me, and I've done so much for her.
[38:14.83]I have done so much for Pam.
[38:16.97]I've bought her drinks.
[38:19.37]I've told her all these cool things.
[38:22.64]I did deliveries for her, and she still doesn't like me.
[38:37.69]You don't think Jerma's 29?
[38:38.46]Yo, you're wrong.
[38:39.18]He's older than that.
[38:40.02]Which is depressing.
[38:42.06]Oh, I'm gonna pass out here.
[38:49.78]Grandpa, what can I give you?
[38:57.91]Uh... Should I just sell this ship?
[39:09.32]I'm just going to sell it.
[39:10.12]Who cares?
[39:16.44]And the sneakers.
[39:19.09]Alright, Grandpa.
[39:20.67]Take it.
[39:21.63]Take all of it.
[39:23.11]No, not that.
[39:33.82]Can't put the sneakers in there.
[39:36.66]That's too bad.
[39:44.58]bed at 7 30. that's so early 400 I'm okay with that that's fine uh slay monsters and I gotta talk to the wizard
[40:14.12]These aren't ready.
[40:21.12]Got a lot of this shit in here and I don't know what the hell to do with it.
[40:43.81]Let's water some plants.
[40:51.17]Can you eventually make an irrigation system?
[40:55.72]I hope so.
[40:57.92]I'd really like it if I could just have these automatically.
[40:59.92]What happened over here?
[41:03.36]Am I crazy, or were they over here the last time?
[41:10.88]I might be crazy.
[41:12.10]I probably am.
[41:21.47]Here you go, dog.
[41:23.17]I've got a treat for you!
[41:28.61]Water the meteor?
[41:32.17]It'd be funny if tomorrow I wake up and this is a meteor tree.
[41:36.39]That would be funny.
[41:38.05]Alright, wizard.
[41:41.59]Wizard is down there.
[41:43.51]Let's go see the wizard.
[41:57.28]Can I get through this?
[42:01.40]Look at my energy already.
[42:02.26]Are you kidding me?
[42:04.26]What the heck?
[42:06.52]What the heck?
[42:08.14]Oh, shit.
[42:08.54]I'm never going to make it through this with the energy I have.
[42:13.71]No, I don't think I can... That's not going to connect to anything down there.
[42:19.47]How do I feel about Overwatch?
[42:20.47]It's a blast.
[42:22.77]I'm really enjoying playing it.
[42:24.92]A lot.
[42:25.30]A lot.
[42:28.83]we're off to see the wizard the wonderful wizard of oz we're here again so as ever wins if ever I wish there was if ever or ever I wish there was the wizard of oz this one because because of the wonderful things he does we're off to see the wizard
[42:55.76]Go, go, go.
[42:57.14]Okay, wizard.
[42:58.36]I have brought you... Elemental to please the job.
[43:02.51]Yeah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[43:05.45]Sick.
[43:06.81]Thanks for the money.
[43:08.37]Chump.
[43:12.73]Are you gonna start streaming a lot from now on, or is this a temporary thing?
[43:17.12]Well, judging by this last almost two weeks now, I've streamed for like five, four or five hours a day, pretty much every single day, except for on the weekend.
[43:30.99]So you can probably take that as a schedule quotes.
[43:35.67]I'll probably stream five days a week or try to.
[43:39.45]I don't want to stop because here's the problem, right?
[43:42.73]When I stop,
[43:45.11]This is the- this- every time, whenever I start streaming and I say I'm gonna stream a lot more, I'm gonna- I'm gonna stream every fucking day!
[43:52.52]I do it for like a few days in a row, and then something comes up, something happens, and I end up not doing it.
[44:00.01]What the fuck do you want?
[44:03.45]What was that?
[44:03.99]I just got the stare down from this little kid and then he just took off.
[44:09.23]Okay.
[44:10.84]So, when I stop playing and when I stop streaming, every single time what happens- What is with you people?
[44:21.05]What is it?
[44:24.53]When I str- This guy's like, this guy's taking a picture of me and sending it to you- What, are you making fun of me?
[44:29.25]You're gonna take a picture of me and like make fun of me and tweet it to your friends?
[44:32.63]You all hate me that much?
[44:36.12]Oh, you're playing a game.
[44:36.86]Yeah, nice cover.
[44:38.62]I'm gonna go over here.
[44:39.32]I'm gonna hide in the corner.
[44:43.21]Anyways, when I stop because I want to either make a video and it takes like four or five days for me to make a particular video or play a different game off stream, I get into a different habit and I don't stream anymore.
[44:58.83]And then by the time I like want to turn my stream back on, it's been like five, six, seven, eight days since I turned it on.
[45:04.05]I'm just like, ah, it's been, ah, maybe I'll do it next week.
[45:08.29]So I just can't stop.
[45:09.06]I just need to keep doing what I've been doing the last two weeks.
[45:12.27]And I won't have to stop because I won't have a reason to.
[45:16.95]So let's see what she has to say about that.
[45:19.29]She's fucking furious with me.
[45:29.44]What did I do?
[45:30.20]I didn't clean your boots before you walk around in my house.
[45:37.17]I don't understand.
[45:38.11]Is this her house?
[45:41.50]I didn't even do that.
[45:42.14]Is somebody impersonating me?
[45:43.26]I feel like somebody's walking around with a duck mask and punching townspeople in the face.
[45:51.79]Okay, what's next on the list?
[46:00.82]I could do the animals.
[46:02.14]I could find the last person.
[46:08.24]Am I gonna stream TF2?
[46:09.22]Probably not.
[46:10.81]Probably not.
[46:11.61]Not right now.
[46:15.11]My current, in quote, games are Overwatch.
[46:20.83]This.
[46:21.17]I mean, I've been playing this a lot.
[46:23.82]And kind of random stuff that I find to be fun.
[46:26.46]That's the last person.
[46:30.70]You wish there was a mall here.
[46:33.46]Okay.
[46:34.54]I got friends.
[46:35.10]Give someone a gift.
[46:35.80]Okay, I give this person a gift.
[46:37.64]New pair of shoes.
[46:40.68]Hey, just met you?
[46:42.06]How would you like a new pair of shoes?
[46:47.14]What the hell?
[46:48.72]I can't give it to her?
[46:54.41]Why can't I... I'm gonna yawn.
[46:55.71]I'm sorry.
[46:59.87]Why can't I... I guess you can't give people that stuff.
[47:02.45]And I don't want to give her a bush because too many people hate me.
[47:05.31]So I need to get her something nice.
[47:10.92]Let's go get her something nice right now.
[47:13.86]What do you think she wants?
[47:14.78]There's a general store.
[47:17.06]I'm going to go to the general store.
[47:25.31]Maybe I'll fish for a little while.
[47:35.97]I know this is crazy, but here are some sneakers.
[47:37.73]Don't hate me.
[47:41.22]Oh, Emily's birthday.
[47:42.46]You ain't getting shit.
[47:49.30]You need an eel to rub on your sore calves.
[47:52.21]Please bring one as soon as... Where do I get an eel?
[47:55.79]And that's obviously fishing, but where do you get eels?
[48:01.75]It is Farmer Greg.
[48:02.51]How are you?
[48:03.95]Okay.
[48:04.76]Should I get her a box of sugar?
[48:07.14]I'm gonna get her some vinegar.
[48:13.37]Hey, I just met you.
[48:14.41]Here's a bottle of vinegar.
[48:22.12]Should I get her a Coca-Cola or something?
[48:28.68]I'm gonna give her some sugar.
[48:31.70]She's gonna like that, right?
[48:32.92]I'm gonna be like, oh, this is... I'll give her a line, too.
[48:38.00]Hey, I got you something.
[48:39.14]I got you some sugar.
[48:39.94]It's almost as sweet as you.
[48:51.03]Where the hell was she?
[48:51.55]Over here.
[48:54.03]Hey, I got you some sugar.
[48:55.09]That's how much this means to you.
[49:10.62]Thanks for the hundred gold.
[49:16.82]I can't wait to be popular.
[49:23.53]Good start.
[49:24.33]You were the last bastion of hope.
[49:27.43]And now solidified.
[49:28.83]You all hate me.
[49:29.43]Everyone in the whole town.
[49:31.13]I don't need you.
[49:31.63]100 gold down the drain.
[49:45.01]So what are you supposed to do with the gear that you can't sell?
[49:50.79]Can the blacksmith take it or something?
[49:56.08]Oh, he saw me go in the trash.
[49:57.26]He didn't like it.
[50:11.93]I think I found out why people don't like me.
[50:14.29]Is that sicko going through the trash again?
[50:16.87]What's wrong with that guy?
[50:19.09]God, I'm so glad we don't talk to him.
[50:27.05]Okay.
[50:30.26]I need an eel.
[50:31.70]How many days?
[50:32.14]Two days?
[50:33.44]Where do I get an eel?
[50:35.90]In a river?
[50:36.98]In a river?
[50:38.12]Eel in a river?
[50:44.37]Maybe I can get an eel in the river.
[50:48.37]Yeah, I probably can get it in the river.
[50:53.86]Any, uh, any of you chat guys have, uh, insider information on where the eels hang out?
[51:02.64]Could use that 255 gold right now.
[51:14.93]In the ocean?
[51:16.53]You sure it's not gonna be in the river?
[51:19.09]How nice if I could rocket-shade eat him.
[51:25.20]I guess I'll go down here.
[51:26.36]Can I... There's only like one place on the ocean I can go to.
[51:33.29]In the morning ocean?
[51:34.87]We'll do that then.
[51:35.53]I was gonna go to bed.
[51:38.87]First let me eat some trash in front of this guy.
[51:42.77]I can't.
[51:48.07]I'm seeing morning and night.
[51:52.25]Well, I'll do it at night then.
[51:53.15]It's almost night.
[51:56.79]Hey, buddy.
[51:59.67]Catching some fish.
[52:00.42]You're fishing really next to the rock here.
[52:05.44]Whatever you say.
[52:12.54]Last time I came here, there was a oyster on the ground, and it was worth a lot of money.
[52:17.37]It's like, wow, cool.
[52:18.57]Money.
[52:21.77]Money.
[52:22.03]Money.
[52:24.49]Money.
[52:37.60]money I'm not moving got it come on give me some money anchovy and iron ore damn nice
[53:06.85]That was a nice cast.
[53:15.96]Seaweed.
[53:17.46]Just eat this stuff.
[53:18.74]Because I want to be able to stay out here and get an eel.
[53:27.52]Eat the seaweed too.
[53:31.95]Yummy.
[53:34.81]Ooh.
[53:35.65]Yummy.
[53:36.25]Money.
[53:42.39]Oh, I got distracted.
[53:43.27]I thought that was a Bob.
[53:45.07]Oh, not more seaweed.
[54:06.21]Just eat it.
[54:10.26]We gotta catch some fresh fish.
[54:13.70]Ooh!
[54:14.70]Something's right there.
[54:17.35]Yeah, fuck it.
[54:17.87]I wanna go.
[54:18.47]I want that.
[54:21.27]No, it's gotta be right there.
[54:23.91]No.
[54:25.13]Right here.
[54:27.61]Got it.
[54:28.19]Come on.
[54:32.61]This is gonna be a big one.
[54:34.41]This is gonna be a big one.
[54:35.39]Ooh!
[54:39.69]Oh, no, it's not what I wanted.
[54:43.74]That's perfect.
[54:45.28]That is perfect.
[54:49.04]Right in the bubbles.
[54:58.18]It's just a halibut.
[55:03.08]25 energy.
[55:03.46]I'll eat the bass.
[55:11.43]No eels.
[55:21.41]Does fresh seaweed have bugs in it?
[55:22.75]Probably.
[55:23.15]Although, bugs underwater?
[55:26.41]Unless you're talking about a water bug or something.
[55:29.18]I don't know.
[55:30.06]Is that even possible?
[55:32.76]Give me an eel.
[55:38.04]Give me an eel.
[55:45.92]Just eat them both.
[55:51.00]That delicious uncooked just caught fish.
[56:05.54]Six inch anchovy.
[56:12.68]I've been eating a lot.
[56:13.70]I feel like I shouldn't be eating this much.
[56:16.60]I've eaten like nine fishes.
[56:24.48]Make it be an eel.
[56:25.36]Make it be an eel.
[56:26.28]Make it be an eel.
[56:31.01]It's an anchovy.
[56:35.87]Damn.
[56:38.87]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[56:41.95]Hey!
[56:43.39]Shawn Michael!
[56:45.55]a.k.o.
[56:46.23]Shawn Michael.
[56:48.55]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[56:50.45]Welcome to the expanding universe.
[56:53.23]Please enjoy your stay.
[56:56.68]Much appreciated.
[57:00.72]Ah, the French.
[57:01.98]Another one.
[57:02.36]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[57:05.38]Mr. Sandman, 42.
[57:09.21]Welcome.
[57:09.75]Thanks for subscribing.
[57:17.46]That really does look like... The sun really does look like a cheesy meatball Dorito.
[57:23.93]Doesn't even look like the sun.
[57:29.13]Come on, give me a feel.
[57:30.81]I'm gonna have to start leaving soon.
[57:48.88]Come back really early in the morning, see if it happens.
[57:55.78]This is the last cast I can do here before I'm going to have to run home.
[57:59.83]It has to be raining to catch an eel.
[58:05.13]What?
[58:05.29]Are you serious?
[58:08.27]Well, let's go.
[58:09.12]Last one.
[58:10.66]By the big turd.
[58:19.21]It's raining.
[58:19.89]It's not going to rain forever.
[58:29.13]Okay, bye-bye.
[58:31.36]Running out of daylight.
[58:33.68]Eels only appear during rain.
[58:36.32]How do I make it rain?
[58:37.06]I'm going to pass out.
[58:42.02]I'm probably going to pass out here.
[58:43.68]I'm really close to it being pass out time.
[58:52.63]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[58:57.97]T.N.
[58:58.37]Collin.
[59:01.97]Thank you for subbing.
[59:03.39]Welcome.
[59:06.61]You subbed just in time for me to pass out in front of my front door.
[59:15.08]Go, go.
[59:16.26]Don't get stuck in the trees.
[59:19.30]No!
[59:20.30]2AM. Don't click the 2AM. Oh god.
[59:30.30]Oh well, somebody saw me passed outside my front door. Oh that's gonna- come on.
[59:39.30]Gilkay found you last night. You were unconscious and someone was searching your pockets.
[59:52.27]This whole town hates me.
[59:54.87]I'm telling you.
[59:56.63]I'm fucking telling you.
[59:58.15]Why?
[59:58.43]Okay, so... Somebody stole my money.
[60:06.09]Nobody likes me.
[60:11.57]That's so horrible.
[60:12.35]I got fucking robbed outside my own house by somebody in this town.
[60:18.68]What a joke.
[60:23.88]I need more seeds.
[60:25.82]Let's go sell these and buy some seeds.
[60:35.65]Ah, can we see some suns in the chat?
[60:41.59]Panic the cat.
[60:43.09]I like you too.
[60:45.91]I like you too.
[60:55.84]9 a.m.
[61:02.72]Can we see some fucking cheesy Dorito pepperoni meatballs in the chat?
[61:20.11]I'm not gonna sit here till 9 a.m.
[61:37.21]Back to fishing.
[61:38.65]Until 9.
[61:55.97]You missed the character creation?
[61:57.71]That's a duckbill.
[62:00.97]He's got a Charlie Brown shirt and a duckbill.
[62:13.64]I've gotten two shitty items.
[62:14.84]Alright, 9 o'clock.
[62:15.44]Let's sell this crap.
[62:20.22]I keep seeing dog here, but there's never a dog.
[62:25.15]I don't ever see a dog there.
[62:33.47]What do I want here?
[62:40.28]Have I met this person?
[62:41.90]Why do I feel like I don't know this person?
[62:49.92]What are you doing out here?
[62:52.10]Hello, um... The weather's interesting today, don't you think?
[62:55.66]Yeah.
[62:56.98]Sure is.
[62:57.38]You want a fish?
[63:00.45]No.
[63:00.81]You don't get a fish.
[63:02.79]You don't get shit.
[63:03.57]Okay, you're finally open, sir.
[63:17.71]What are you gonna give me for this?
[63:21.62]Ooh, that's a lot of money.
[63:22.54]Okay.
[63:27.03]10 days.
[63:32.51]This is what I had last time, and I'm not buying beans again.
[63:37.17]It was a disaster last time.
[63:38.39]It was a total disaster.
[63:42.24]Potatoes, six days.
[63:43.62]Tulips, six days.
[63:45.26]Kale, six days.
[64:03.15]10% that's nothing 10% we're talking six days so it'll be five days and what like 18 hours that's not worth it 28 days to produce a mature apricot tree
[64:32.15]Should I buy a tree?
[64:33.19]Should I buy an apricot tree?
[64:37.59]Bears fruit in the spring.
[64:40.67]It's summer right now, so it would take a whole entire season.
[64:48.64]Maybe we'll just go back to parsnips.
[64:52.62]You know what?
[64:52.92]I'm going to buy an absolute dog shit worth of parsnips, boys.
[65:03.32]We're going to have a giant parsnip field.
[65:09.83]You thought we weren't going to have a hundred parsnips.
[65:13.39]Is that what you thought?
[65:30.42]What year is it?
[65:39.74]We're not in spring.
[66:02.85]I saved it!
[66:03.87]I got it, don't worry!
[66:05.55]Don't worry, we're fine.
[66:06.61]We're fine.
[66:10.03]We're okay.
[66:16.62]See, look, we're fine.
[66:19.70]Oh, what's this?
[66:20.26]Oh, I just woke up.
[66:22.78]Man, what a... What a day.
[66:27.00]Man, somebody robbed me?
[66:27.89]Oh, somebody robbed me.
[66:28.87]I fell asleep.
[66:29.35]Guys, remember when I just passed out?
[66:30.59]Man, you're like, somebody stole my money.
[66:31.87]Oh, what do I do?
[66:32.61]Everybody hates me in this town.
[66:33.89]What do I got here?
[66:36.71]Oh, nice cauliflower.
[66:38.52]Let me pick this up for the first time.
[66:41.61]Cool.
[66:42.97]I got a gold one.
[66:43.79]Awesome.
[66:45.55]Make sure to water these plants.
[66:49.72]Never forget Mr. Resetti.
[66:52.46]That would have been so cool if I had a fucking hundred parsnips.
[67:00.33]I'm going to do it again.
[67:01.15]I want to do it again.
[67:05.73]Okay, let's go do it again.
[67:09.27]Nothing happened.
[67:10.03]Don't worry.
[67:10.45]Yeah, what a weird dream.
[67:14.20]I bought a hundred parsnips.
[67:19.56]Hey, just take a look at this frog for a second.
[67:28.71]Okay, we have to do everything exactly the same.
[67:35.12]What did I do?
[67:35.46]I came over and fished.
[67:38.50]I will fuck up the space-time continuum if I don't do everything exactly the same.
[67:45.94]I took a sip out of my drink right here.
[67:52.67]Okay.
[67:54.69]Okay, I'm not going to pay attention.
[68:01.09]Didn't water the alien boulder.
[68:04.99]Okay.
[68:06.29]I did it again, right?
[68:07.63]Till 9am?
[68:22.14]I didn't water the meteor.
[68:23.32]You're right.
[68:28.32]The whole world's gonna end.
[68:29.86]I did not water the meteor.
[68:38.84]Where's Penny?
[68:42.44]She's not even here.
[68:49.04]I love how people are doing the actual, like, sun, Earth, moon, as in the way they're set up in real life.
[68:57.84]Just wait till you get the other planets.
[69:00.38]You'll be able to sequentially line up the whole solar system.
[69:07.47]By distance.
[69:11.01]Okay.
[69:15.81]Salad.
[69:18.59]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[69:22.05]Lou Young, 239.
[69:23.13]Thanks so much for subbing.
[69:26.43]Welcome.
[69:29.18]Much love.
[69:30.88]How are you?
[69:33.76]Thanks for dropping that sub, baby.
[69:38.06]Okay.
[69:38.86]No parsnips.
[69:41.34]No beans.
[69:41.94]Does this guy sell anything that goes in the summer?
[69:46.98]Plant in spring.
[69:49.58]Plant in spring.
[69:50.34]Hold on a second.
[69:51.08]I don't... So what can I do in the summer?
[69:54.91]Does this guy sell anything for the summer?
[69:56.51]Or do I have to do trees?
[69:59.77]Bears fruit in the summer.
[70:05.89]How close am I to the summer?
[70:10.62]So in what, in like two days it's going to be so I can't plant anything until the summertime?
[70:21.46]Fall camp.
[70:22.64]That's awesome.
[70:24.96]You're doing the actual distance there too?
[70:27.08]That's so funny.
[70:32.22]Yeah, just tomorrow.
[70:33.32]Okay.
[70:34.60]Well, I'm going to sell the fish and ships.
[70:38.42]I can't sell it to him.
[70:41.31]Deckhead.
[70:43.55]That wasn't very nice.
[70:44.43]I shouldn't have done that.
[70:46.47]Alright, I'll fish.
[70:48.01]We're doing a whole day of fishing, boys.
[70:49.88]And going through the trash.
[70:54.40]Shut up.
[70:56.44]You know what?
[70:56.76]Fuck this guy.
[71:01.50]Is there a problem?
[71:05.58]He's like desperately trying to get away from me.
[71:12.56]Dammit, this scary guy.
[71:14.84]Get me away from him.
[71:16.04]Get away from him, please.
[71:17.30]Please don't hurt me.
[71:17.84]I don't know what I need to do with this guy.
[71:27.29]Oh my god, he's gonna kill me.
[71:28.41]I wonder where he goes.
[71:31.35]I got this guy locked in.
[71:41.22]Merry Christmas.
[71:43.99]That's a terrible gift.
[71:46.39]Well, good luck getting out.
[71:49.03]Because there's a guy with an axe at the door.
[71:54.12]How many people can I lock in here?
[72:04.82]Every time I scare somebody, they go into the shrine.
[72:09.92]Can I scare anybody else?
[72:15.59]Oh, there's people up there.
[72:21.33]Ah, damn it.
[72:25.96]You've never been religious, but hey, I'm old.
[72:30.24]Yeah.
[72:30.36]Okay.
[72:43.95]Blasphemy!
[72:45.39]Get out of here!
[72:52.55]So, let me just go fish for the rest of my life.
[73:02.82]They're praying for your demise.
[73:10.63]Jeremy, you're being a dick.
[73:12.98]Am I?
[73:14.36]Am I, though?
[73:17.00]Let's be real here.
[73:19.24]This whole town has shunned me since I got in.
[73:22.34]I've been nothing but nice.
[73:24.06]I've given gifts to people, I've talked to people, I've done chores.
[73:27.03]I've done chores for all these people.
[73:29.69]And they just tell me, like, I'm gross, get out of the way, get out of my face.
[73:34.23]No.
[73:35.29]Am I the dick?
[73:36.79]Or am I a product of this fucked up society in this town?
[73:41.82]They made me a dick.
[73:45.97]I was nothing but nice.
[73:47.37]I was trying to be as cordial and as cool and as interesting.
[73:51.23]You know, I'm a duck.
[73:52.49]Nobody likes that, apparently.
[74:02.08]I'm almost out of energy already.
[74:08.18]I'm being a creep?
[74:08.98]No I'm not!
[74:09.62]I'm just like standing in front of people and staring at them.
[74:21.57]I gave them gifts of rocks and wood.
[74:24.65]Well, these people have expensive tastes.
[74:27.61]You can't give everybody a diamond and do all their chores.
[74:33.33]Looking for... Wait, I'm the creep?
[74:35.97]I'm the weirdo in this game?
[74:38.39]There's a guy in this town that wants me to get an eel so he can rub it all over his body.
[74:43.87]But I'm the weirdo.
[74:46.37]Oh, by the way, I'm the one that's going to go get the thing for that guy to rub on his body.
[74:53.39]I'm the creep, though.
[74:54.46]I'm the fucking weirdo in this game.
[75:01.16]No way.
[75:09.51]How come nobody does my chores?
[75:13.13]I don't go back to my farm and see that the soil's already been tilled.
[75:20.22]I want to fish over here.
[75:20.94]Can I chop the pink tree down?
[75:32.06]I don't know.
[75:32.36]I don't think so.
[75:34.96]Were there bubbles to the left?
[75:35.84]I was too busy explaining my side of the story as to why these people are all bad people.
[75:44.00]No, I can't chop it down.
[75:47.76]Well, time for bed.
[75:58.74]They are the ones making these creepy emotes.
[76:02.11]Those are pictures of the planets.
[76:06.99]That's what it looks like.
[76:08.46]Okay, guys, have you ever looked at the planet Earth or a moon through a telescope?
[76:14.58]It must not have been pretty recently.
[76:23.44]Take it easy, Red Ranger.
[76:24.32]Thanks for coming.
[76:26.19]Thanks for hanging out.
[76:29.07]Let me sell these fish.
[76:33.62]Hmm.
[77:03.85]What was that?
[77:14.68]Level 2 farming.
[77:15.62]I can craft a fence?
[77:17.43]Mayonnaise machine?
[77:18.43]Oh, I can get a sprinkler!
[77:21.03]I want the mayonnaise machine, though.
[77:24.43]That's really important to me.
[77:35.37]there's an earthquake oh please why are these dead are these dead these are all shriveled up don't tell me that these are all shriveled up is because it took too long
[78:04.69]I think these are dead.
[78:09.53]Okay, I'm just making a mayonnaise machine.
[78:11.11]I'm going to eat mayonnaise for the rest of my life.
[78:14.51]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[78:19.72]Chris H312.

[78:32.55]Really appreciate it.
[78:36.05]This is top priority.
[78:38.99]But I don't have eggs.
[78:39.69]How do I get eggs?
[78:40.39]I need a chicken, probably.
[78:44.06]Did my anger cause an earthquake?
[78:47.64]Did I do that?
[78:52.57]Well, what's that?
[78:56.73]Spiceberry.
[79:04.47]I need to make a chicken coop.
[79:06.03]Can I sell the mayonnaise?
[79:06.95]That would be cool.
[79:21.98]I really could go for a ripe radish.
[79:23.84]I would be so happy somebody...
[79:26.79]These people are so weird.
[79:27.85]300 gold.
[79:31.19]Just go pick a radish in your front lawn.
[79:33.99]Are they that rare?

[79:42.78]Alright, where do I go to do that?
[79:47.18]Robin, the local carpenter, lives north of town.
[79:49.40]In exchange for raw materials and money, she'll construct new buildings on your farm.
[79:52.60]You'll need her to build a coop or barn so you can raise animals.
[79:57.50]Go pay her a visit.
[80:00.22]So what is she like up here?
[80:06.71]I want chicken.
[80:07.35]I want to make mayonnaise.

[81:30.50]Okay, so whatever the cheapest crop to buy in the summer, I'm going to plant 100 of them.
[81:37.70]And then in a few days, reap the benefits, build a chicken coop, and make a mayonnaise machine.
[81:45.91]You know what I'm saying?
[81:47.89]You know what I mean?

[84:01.93]Get out of here.
[84:05.07]Bye.
[84:05.43]That's painful to have to do that, but you know, whatever.
[84:11.26]Let's begin the transfusion.
[84:20.33]the sneaker.
[84:22.95]No axe, don't need any of this stuff.
[84:28.71]Okay.
[84:29.65]We have our seeds.
[84:31.13]How much is it to craft fertilizer?
[84:37.53]Two sap?
[84:39.85]I want to have a totally fertilized place.
[84:43.06]So I need to get a bunch of sap.
[84:44.08]We've got to cut down a bunch of trees.
[84:49.33]Give me the axe.
[84:52.92]Let's go get some sap.
[84:56.06]Sap time.
[84:59.12]Cut down the trees.
[85:01.34]For the sap.
[85:06.89]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[85:08.79]I cut it the other way so it doesn't fall.
[85:11.23]In the water.
[85:13.25]Not making that mistake again.
[85:20.31]Kidding me?
[85:24.97]My dog would be fertilizer.
[85:26.39]My dog is up there, fine, sleeping.
[85:28.23]It's gonna fall in the ocean.
[85:30.79]I thought it was gonna fall down here.
[85:32.11]I thought I was chopping down.
[85:35.29]Why didn't it fall down?
[85:48.72]No sap?
[85:55.75]Okay, guys.
[85:58.93]You guys have known me for long enough.
[86:01.77]Sometimes I just say a word that's supposed to be a different word.
[86:05.49]But it means the same word to me.
[86:07.79]Water.
[86:08.32]Ocean.
[86:08.76]Pond.
[86:09.30]Lake.
[86:09.78]River.
[86:10.00]Like, ocean.
[86:10.90]Pond.
[86:11.24]Water.
[86:14.88]Everybody, it's just semantics.
[86:18.90]Right, Otto?
[86:21.35]That's right.
[86:22.01]Yeah, thanks.
[86:24.31]I could always count on you, Otto.
[86:38.22]How much sap do I need?
[86:39.00]64.
[86:39.48]We're doing full sap.
[86:47.11]You just caught an eel?
[86:49.15]Exactly where did you get it?
[86:50.97]What time and exact place?
[86:57.30]I must know.
[86:57.88]I'm getting tired.
[87:08.40]Uh...
[87:14.12]I only have 30.
[87:15.88]Well, I don't want to be exhausted tomorrow.
[87:18.52]I'm going to bed.
[87:19.08]There, you want me to... Fine, here you go.
[87:30.07]You guys want me to take care of the dog?
[87:31.33]I will.
[87:31.73]There, see?
[87:36.11]He's fine.
[87:43.69]Wake up.
[87:46.39]3 p.m.
[87:46.87]sleep.
[87:47.15]See?
[87:47.33]Level 2 foraging.
[87:49.01]I can make a survival burger.
[87:50.98]Nice.
[87:54.16]Is the meteor growing?
[87:55.00]Yeah, it seems to be.
[87:56.46]I don't know what's going to happen, but we'll find out.
[88:00.98]Found this in a drawer somewhere.
[88:03.16]Thought you could use it.
[88:09.57]Guys.
[88:13.41]Breakdown what just happened.
[88:16.71]That was a re-gift.
[88:22.64]That was a re-gift.
[88:25.60]I gave her a beer like four days ago.
[88:28.72]And she was like, oh yeah, sure, whatever.
[88:30.28]She put it in a drawer.
[88:33.44]And sent it back to me.
[88:37.58]Three days later.
[88:46.16]You've re-gifted me a beer that I gave to you already.
[88:53.56]Okie dokie.
[88:56.70]No, I'm not going to let it get to me.
[88:58.12]I'll let it get to you.
[88:58.74]You've got more important things.
[88:59.64]Just wait until you're the mayonnaise.
[89:00.98]Wait until you're the most famous mayonnaise person in the world.
[89:04.67]Then they'll see.
[89:06.41]They'll be lining up to talk to me then.
[89:17.92]Oh, maple seed.
[89:18.62]I don't need these talents, people.
[89:28.82]All I care about is my business.
[89:30.34]I'll have my business up and running.
[89:33.68]Nobody will ever tear it down.
[89:46.59]45, a couple of trees.
[89:55.48]Have I played Slime Ranch or no?
[89:58.10]I've heard it's fun, but I have not personally played it.
[90:12.79]Yeah, one day I'll come out here with a scythe and I'll just get rid of all this crap.
[90:16.94]But today is plant a hundred crops day.
[90:29.53]What's going on with this rainbow of butterflies?
[90:49.20]65.
[90:49.24]We got it.
[90:50.40]Alright, guys.
[90:51.76]It's time to make the gigantic farm a reality.
[90:58.90]Okay, I'm gonna say, like, down here.
[91:00.92]Get rid of all this crap.
[91:08.43]I gotta actually plan this out a little bit.
[91:14.27]Let me go put all this crap in the trash.
[91:18.15]Uh...
[91:20.28]I just did the Orson Welles.
[91:21.26]I went... Should I like plant this shit?
[91:26.62]I feel like I should be doing this.
[91:27.66]Okay.
[91:49.19]Where's the hoe?
[91:59.15]Oh no, I'm getting a phone call.
[92:04.85]Remind me later to answer that.
[92:06.25]I'll call them back.
[92:09.29]You know.
[92:12.44]Okay.
[92:13.20]We have our seeds.
[92:13.84]We need to make the fertilizer.
[92:17.32]Basic fertilizer!
[92:18.32]Ah, shit.
[92:21.40]I need more sap.
[92:26.41]It's okay.
[92:26.77]It's enough to do at least one batch.
[92:29.46]It's enough to do one batch.
[92:35.52]One, two, three, four, five.
[92:39.97]Let's see, 30.
[92:42.91]So one, two, three, four, five.
[92:46.27]One, two, three, four, five.
[92:52.41]One, two, three, four, five.
[92:57.44]two three four five one two five ten fifteen twenty twenty five thirty right so then we do fertilizer one two three four five
[93:29.30]I guess I'll just spam it.
[93:30.74]Doesn't even matter.
[93:31.32]Alright.
[93:36.84]What goes here?
[93:37.36]Radishes or... We'll do peppers over here.
[93:40.21]I want some high quality peppers.
[93:46.81]Somebody just wrote, shh, no one tell him.
[93:53.11]What is it?
[93:53.33]What do you mean, don't tell him?
[93:56.86]Shush, no one tell him.
[93:59.83]I'm not planning this until I figure out what that person said.
[94:03.62]What does that person mean?
[94:14.40]What's going on here?
[94:17.95]I'm scared.
[94:19.55]Just tell him?
[94:20.43]What did I do wrong?
[94:21.11]What's going on?
[94:23.23]Plant these in the summer.
[94:24.33]It takes five days to mature and continues to produce after first harvest.
[94:42.34]Wait a second.
[94:42.78]Hold on.
[94:43.02]I think I know what's going on here.
[94:51.76]I know what's going on.
[95:10.99]Right?
[95:13.98]Right?
[95:14.16]Because are you saying I can't stand on this?
[95:21.80]Ronnie, I actually don't know what people are talking about.
[95:24.86]What is happening?
[95:26.40]I feel like everyone's out to get me.
[95:29.86]Don't tell me to open the meteor.
[95:31.76]What did I do wrong?
[95:32.80]What did I do?
[95:35.46]Reset.
[95:41.16]What happened?
[95:44.97]Yeah, you guys thought you were gonna get me?
[95:46.59]Nope.
[95:56.53]I can sti- I can stand on him, I don't give a shit.
[95:59.40]It's a done deal.
[96:06.66]The run is dead.
[96:18.26]Oh, no.
[96:18.68]I'm starting to get tired.
[96:19.44]I need to eat something.
[96:25.58]I need to eat something.
[96:26.29]Hold on.
[96:28.47]Is there any trash I can eat in here?
[96:32.53]Oh, you know what?
[96:35.33]Radish.
[96:35.69]Whatever the hell this is.
[96:45.76]I can walk on them.
[96:48.55]It's not gonna kill them, is it?
[96:51.13]No, I've been walking on them.
[96:56.34]Eat the shoe.
[97:00.72]Oh, yeah?
[97:03.12]Drink the beer.
[97:06.04]Hey, Pam.
[97:07.08]Thanks a lot.
[97:08.82]Thanks for the drink.
[97:18.55]Here we go.
[97:19.45]All watered.
[97:27.52]No turning back.
[97:28.88]I don't understand what I did.
[97:31.38]But I'm sure I'll find out.
[97:32.66]Time for bed.
[97:33.28]6 o'clock.
[97:33.92]It's my bedtime.
[97:48.43]Okay, now... 25 or 1 coal.
[97:54.61]Don't I have a coal in here?
[97:55.55]Ah, and remember guys, I'm the weirdo.
[98:07.79]This guy took his pants off somewhere in the bushes.
[98:14.10]Mayor Lewis has lost his shorts.
[98:20.00]This dude was without his pants on.
[98:24.36]And hiding somewhere.
[98:26.28]And I'm the weirdo.
[98:32.16]I never took my pants off.
[98:34.49]Have you seen me in this game take my pants off?
[98:38.87]No.
[98:40.03]But that guy has a bunch of friends.
[99:00.89]Should I just go to bed again and just keep waking up?
[99:03.75]Alright, I gotta get some, uh... This is my scythe.
[99:12.48]I need a scarecrow.
[99:19.89]I already have enough to do this.
[99:21.41]I can already make it.
[99:22.03]Yeah, okay.
[99:35.49]Okay.
[99:36.63]Scarecrow.
[99:37.21]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[99:39.27]It's a pretty big area, right?
[99:40.96]Put him right in the middle.
[99:48.82]Right here.
[99:49.56]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[99:50.52]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[99:51.72]1, 2, 3.
[99:51.80]Yeah.
[99:52.42]I'm good to go.
[99:54.56]Yeah, this is probably poisoning all the crops here.
[100:04.52]Okay, now what?
[100:05.58]I need to plant these.
[100:09.18]These are going to go over here.
[100:10.07]Oh, you... Come on.
[100:18.87]This is such an eyesore.
[100:28.39]We need 30 again, so that's... how much was this?
[100:30.57]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 7, 14, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.
[100:32.29]See, we've got the little thought bubble.
[100:34.48]Now I need more of this.
[101:01.00]I need sap.
[101:02.52]Let's cut down some more trees.
[101:12.65]Hello trees.
[101:20.43]He's doing it again.
[101:21.17]There's nothing wrong with what I'm doing.
[101:24.12]There's nothing wrong with what I'm doing.
[101:25.42]I can pick those up, can't I?
[101:29.52]I'm not doing anything wrong.
[101:30.98]You're doing something wrong.
[101:33.38]Not me.
[101:46.02]Is this like something specific to summertime that I don't know, that I'm not aware of?
[102:00.13]Am I in for like a big gotcha moment coming up here?
[102:13.67]Why won't I be able to get to the crops in the middle?
[102:15.93]Can't I just walk over them?
[102:17.84]I can just pick them up.
[102:19.36]Dog, get out of here.
[102:20.74]This is not for you.
[102:26.60]They're messing with you.
[102:27.40]I'm sure of it.
[102:28.92]You can't be so sure.
[102:31.83]What if it's legit?
[102:32.91]What if I did something wrong?
[102:34.13]I don't know.
[102:36.49]Just to be honest, Jeremiah, I don't know what's happening.
[102:38.06]I'm just going with the crowd.
[102:47.57]Oh, let me address that, by the way.
[102:48.73]Somebody just said that, and it's my total ignorance.
[102:53.26]So, because I haven't, like, streamed really in a row since, like, somewhere over a couple years ago...
[103:02.14]Apparently Twitch changed their policy with subs and ads.
[103:06.88]I did not know that.
[103:08.52]I guess like up until a couple years ago, subs to channels didn't get ads on those channels.
[103:15.05]I guess they do now.
[103:16.57]Apparently.
[103:17.69]I did not know that, but something you don't need to worry about.
[103:20.49]I don't run ads on this stream ever.
[103:23.39]In fact, I have never one time in the last two weeks ran one single ad on the channel.
[103:29.28]So whatever.
[103:31.74]It's not the only time you're going to get an ad.
[103:33.96]I think is if you like open up the stream.
[103:38.16]Yeah, only old channels have no sub ads.
[103:39.92]I did not know that.
[103:40.56]I thought it was still everybody had, you know, I didn't know that.
[103:44.92]I actually saw that today and I was like, what?
[103:51.64]How many do I have?
[103:52.22]31.
[103:53.74]Foxy Mew just subscribed?
[103:55.74]Foxy.
[104:05.77]Please, uh... Please let me know what's going on here.
[104:08.73]Am I getting fooled with?
[104:09.51]I feel like I'm getting fooled with.
[104:13.53]You know what?
[104:18.13]I'm not going to bed right now.
[104:19.37]I'm eating these.
[104:19.96]There's too much work to do.
[104:31.66]I should run ads.
[104:32.30]No, I mean, no.
[104:34.69]I don't care.
[104:48.62]Secret stream?
[104:49.45]Okay, I need to make crafting.
[104:53.83]Almost there.
[105:21.77]Yeah, the meteors did change overnight, like a couple nights ago.
[105:25.53]It's getting weird.
[105:26.79]But I don't know what to do about it.
[105:27.81]Okay, do I... Can I... Please tell me I can get those, thank God.
[105:40.78]Uh, how many more do I need?
[105:41.58]I actually don't know.
[105:59.26]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[106:01.02]I need eight more.
[106:01.77]Give me the X. Karate chop.
[106:15.28]Karate chop.
[106:29.20]cherry bomb the crops again no way I've learned from that mistake one more tree one more I think
[106:59.74]Eat another one of these.
[107:00.69]Should be enough to plant everything.
[107:03.25]None of you know.
[107:04.87]One more.
[107:07.07]Oh, they're delicious.
[107:11.65]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[107:14.01]I can make more, but whatever.
[107:24.18]Alrighty.
[107:25.36]Let's plant the 30 radishes.
[107:42.65]It's gonna be a big sale guys, it's gonna be a huge sale on this one I Need to make a watering hole whatever the hell it is.
[108:12.18]Oh
[108:18.41]Hopefully those two scarecrows are enough to block any crows.
[108:21.76]Alright, now we sleep for five days.
[108:34.36]I'm just gonna go to bed five days in a row.
[108:43.03]Ah.
[108:43.19]Oh, actually, I still have...
[109:03.59]Do I have enough for another scarecrow?
[109:04.63]Nope, just pray that these don't get attacked.
[109:07.64]Alright, that was a hard day's work.
[109:16.02]It's time for bed.
[109:19.14]Look at that.
[109:19.69]Ah, farm's really coming along, guys.
[109:24.59]You know, I'm really starting to like this place.
[109:37.37]Coming along nicely.
[109:48.98]Water these, and then it's back to bed.
[109:53.86]Should I just do that until these are ready?
[109:56.80]What happens if I do that?
[110:02.79]I hate this fucking stump, but I can't get rid of it.
[110:24.14]Oh, yeah.
[110:24.78]I like this upbeat music.
[110:28.13]It makes me feel good about the world.
[110:35.37]Hey, Scarecrow.
[110:41.67]It's a wonderful day, isn't it?
[111:04.26]Perfect day.

[111:23.23]Yeah, that was a full night's sleep again.
[111:27.06]What a wonderful day.
[111:28.16]I was awake for an hour and ten minutes.
[111:53.04]I come out here with a watering can for an hour and then I go back to bed for a full day and night.
[111:57.22]I just want to sell these.
[112:01.91]I don't care about anything else.
[112:04.53]Everybody in the town hates me anyways.
[112:05.97]This is all I have.
[112:08.29]Refill.
[112:20.97]Don't forget about the dog.
[112:21.99]I won't.
[112:33.17]Yes, I hope they are.
[112:43.63]Mr. Scarecrow, thank you for protecting my crops.
[112:51.94]I'm gonna make so much money.
[112:53.84]It's gonna be glorious.
[112:56.62]I'm gonna make an absolute crapload of money.
[113:09.87]Okay.

[113:16.43]No, let's sleep for 16.
[113:26.38]Almost ready for harvest.
[113:46.59]I love people that go fucking nuts right now.
[113:49.51]That's how my grandpa died.
[113:50.97]All he cared about was his work.
[114:03.71]He didn't care about anything else.
[114:14.54]I got you, dog.
[114:15.14]Don't worry.
[114:16.26]Oh, out of water.
[114:26.23]If we get these again, make sure I didn't miss one.
[114:36.71]I really need a sprinkler after this.
[114:38.09]I'm going to use all this money and I'm going to buy a sprinkler.
[114:43.62]That's what I'm gonna do.
[114:44.90]This, like, 10 grand I'm about to make is going into a new sprinkler.
[114:48.38]It's gonna be so glorious.
[115:05.51]Alright.
[115:07.69]And we're just gonna, for the remainder of the day...
[115:13.72]There you go.
[115:14.32]There you are.

[115:34.06]Mayor's shorts.
[115:37.42]Where the hell... Find and return Mayor Lewis' purple shorts?
[115:40.90]How would I even know where they are?
[115:45.73]Sprinklr will do all the work so you can just be asleep all day and night.
[115:53.37]Should I just go back to bed?
[116:00.20]No, that's such a waste.
[116:02.60]I'm gonna do something.
[116:14.47]I'm just kind of paranoid that someone's going to rob me.
[116:17.05]Somebody already did.
[116:20.60]What does he have in here?
[116:21.24]Anything new?
[116:24.66]What does he got?
[116:27.74]Poppy seeds.
[116:31.22]Oh, you can make beer.
[116:33.04]Cool.
[116:36.93]Corn.
[116:39.09]Summer or fall.
[116:39.89]14 days.
[116:43.12]Maybe I'll do a shitload of corn.
[116:44.54]I'm gonna make just cornfields.
[116:45.86]That's what I'm doing.
[116:48.32]You see this?
[116:48.80]When I make the huge amount of money that I'm gonna make, we're making massive cornfields.
[116:55.83]Mayonnaise can wait.
[116:58.51]I want a big cornfield.
[117:04.77]I guess what I could do now is... Yeah, I'm feeling a little bit tired.
[117:14.88]Feeling a little sleepy, you know?
[117:19.30]It's been a rough day.
[117:20.42]My energy's already half gone anyway.
[117:21.96]It's time for bed.
[117:30.93]Dad's coming back soon.
[117:32.01]I hope he brings me some toys.
[117:35.46]Whatever.
[117:36.46]None of you people in town like me.
[117:46.08]You know, I want to investigate something.
[117:48.77]What does it take to get chickens?
[117:52.75]Purchase animals.
[117:55.63]I guess you can't even see until you have the construction done.
[118:00.51]Oh well.

[118:56.23]I'm tired.
[118:56.99]Going to bed.
[119:04.87]Moment of truth.
[119:06.59]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[119:11.88]Coussé.
[119:12.64]Am I saying that right?
[119:13.60]Coussé?

[119:23.17]Boink.
[119:24.53]Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[119:30.79]Oh, look at this.
[119:31.23]And they come back.
[119:33.00]I almost just slashed them.
[119:33.82]I just had a heart attack.
[119:34.86]I had a heart attack right there.
[119:35.88]I thought they were all going to get chopped.
[119:36.82]I'm going to make so much money.
[119:58.95]Now this is where I need the scythe.
[120:01.47]There's my wheat.
[120:05.90]Hot peppers, man.
[120:07.88]I'm... I cannot wait to see.
[120:09.46]So these just can grow here.
[120:11.78]These just stay here and they continue to grow.
[120:24.26]What was that again, everybody?
[120:25.89]Can't wait till he finds out that he can't... What was that?
[120:28.64]I just made a clean, cool 10 grand.
[120:37.14]I'll see you another batch in four days.
[120:39.88]This is my money maker right here.
[120:42.80]This is my cash flow right here, guys.
[120:55.23]Reset.
[120:58.15]We're about to go cash in.
[120:59.21]What are you talking about?
[121:00.11]We're cashing the F in, guys.
[121:02.43]This is the most money I'm ever going to make in my life.
[121:18.82]I hear you, dog.
[121:23.96]Yeah, the alien rock is still there.
[121:25.32]I can't get rid of it.
[121:26.76]I need to wait until I get a much better pickaxe.

[122:18.45]Appreciate it.
[122:23.00]Alright, let's go sell these.
[122:24.34]Let's go see what we're gonna get for a takeaway.
[122:30.21]Megalomaniacal Jerma, geez.
[122:32.47]Well, when it, like, I'm glancing over and when it shows up as one word, sometimes it can be hard.
[122:37.59]It still is hard.
[122:45.81]I probably still said it wrong.
[122:49.39]Alright, give me my cash.
[122:57.96]That's it?
[123:04.19]That's not very much.
[123:10.85]Is the wheat... Was the wheat more... 10?
[123:13.45]That's it?
[123:17.55]How much is a pepper seed?
[123:19.47]40?
[123:19.61]Hold on a second.
[123:24.15]I bought 30 of them, right?
[123:26.55]What's 40 times 30?
[123:31.73]I barely made a profit.
[123:33.61]So they- they- no, it's because they keep regrowing.
[123:36.25]This is just gonna be an endless supply of like 1,200.
[123:37.97]They regrow.
[123:46.10]Everybody calm down.
[123:47.18]They regrow.
[123:53.26]Don't I have an amethyst?
[123:54.90]No.
[123:55.84]Fuck that guy.
[123:58.10]What am I gonna do with my 10 grand?
[123:59.20]That's a good question.
[124:01.39]I don't have it yet.
[124:02.13]Hey, you want a spice berry?
[124:05.53]Fuck you too.
[124:11.78]Everybody in this whole county hates food.
[124:16.20]Nobody likes food.
[124:17.96]There's nothing else in this game.
[124:19.08]This is a game about food.
[124:20.28]This is a video game about food.
[124:23.22]And growing it.
[124:24.73]And nobody in this town wants it.
[124:29.56]I've tried to give people fish, berries, snacks.
[124:33.88]This whole game's about food.
[124:35.62]And everybody hates food.
[124:40.83]Unbelievable.
[124:49.19]It was raw fish, but the point still stands.
[124:51.55]It was still good.
[124:52.07]You could have cooked it.
[125:01.89]These will be ready tomorrow.
[125:02.68]I hope there's a bigger turnaround on these tomorrow, because I want to go exploring after this.
[125:16.63]What's the turnaround on these?
[125:17.99]They're not done.
[125:19.43]How much longer do these need to be there for?
[125:25.81]How much were the animals...
[125:31.47]I have sprinkler.
[125:32.13]How much is a sprinkler?
[125:32.83]I'm not doing this anymore.
[125:35.13]Copper bar, Aryan bar.
[125:37.22]Alright, I have... I gotta go deeper in that dungeon.
[125:40.92]I need five.
[125:52.45]Oh, I can make one of these.
[126:01.27]IP dog the dog is fine.
[126:03.37]Everyone freaks out about the dog.
[126:06.49]He's gonna be alright.
[126:07.81]I promise Yeah, that's what I'm doing I'm gonna get a bunch of fish And we're going to explore we're going deep down there boys.
[126:19.27]We're gonna get a bunch of fish We're gonna get a bunch of food and we're going down to floor 40.
[126:23.95]That's the plan.
[126:24.49]Oh
[126:29.75]We don't need scythe, we don't need acorn, pine cones, we don't need any of this shit.
[126:34.78]We just need our pickaxe.
[126:36.70]Well, we need a water first.
[126:39.62]Catch a shitload of fish today, all day.
[126:43.16]Then go in fresh tomorrow.
[126:46.72]And get to the very bottom of that dungeon.
[126:58.63]Bork, bork.
[127:02.31]Since when is the dog the sweetest chef from the Muppets?
[127:07.75]Bork, bork, bork.
[127:15.24]Water these again.
[127:16.12]I can't wait to not have to do this ever again.
[127:25.94]That'll be the day.
[127:27.92]Won't it?
[127:37.80]Ugh, it's taking so long.
[127:40.68]Ugh.
[127:50.55]Okay.
[127:51.95]Time to fish.
[127:55.23]We're catching fish all day.
[128:06.97]In fact, just go to bed.
[128:09.11]Because I need more energy.
[128:12.37]No.
[128:12.95]That's a dumb idea.
[128:16.05]I gotta stop going to bed after two hours of being awake.
[128:21.53]I have to stop doing that, man.
[128:22.43]I'm getting in such a stupid bad habit with that.
[128:27.70]Upgrade the water can?
[128:29.34]That's still expensive.
[128:31.24]I'd rather just get a sprinkler.
[128:34.80]Sprinkler only waters four tiles?
[128:40.39]Well, it's okay.
[128:40.83]I can make a bunch of them.
[128:47.75]I think your character has mono.
[128:50.27]Why do you think that?
[128:50.97]And any minute now.
[128:59.06]Come on.
[129:04.36]I need a bunch of food for tomorrow.
[129:06.98]That's not even worth it.
[129:07.82]Just eat it now.
[129:11.14]That sucks.
[129:13.78]What the fuck are you doing?
[129:21.21]Because he sleeps all day.
[129:26.59]Took me a minute to catch that one.
[129:29.35]That's funny.
[129:31.40]I think your character might have mono.
[129:40.66]Caught a goddamn tree.
[129:49.20]Upgrade the house.
[129:51.81]This is a slimy one.
[129:53.71]This is a real slimy bastard.
[129:56.39]Jeez!
[129:56.75]This is the hardest fish I've had to do.
[129:58.73]Catch him!
[130:05.40]Okay, this thing is probably like a thousand pounds.
[130:12.47]I almost got the chest.
[130:18.97]Got the chest.
[130:19.33]Okay, I gotta get this.
[130:32.44]Jeez.
[130:34.42]A pike.
[130:37.42]And a chest.
[130:37.94]What's in the chest?
[130:42.50]Skeleton tail?
[130:47.76]Okay.
[130:49.14]Well, that's very good energy.
[130:57.68]That's not really that good.
[130:58.56]I thought it was going to be a tire I could decorate my house with.
[131:08.38]Fish with extra bones.
[131:10.34]That's how I like them.
[131:13.66]Am I in the pike spot?
[131:16.42]This must be the pike spot.
[131:19.78]Well, maybe they're worth a lot.
[131:22.00]I'll sit here and do this all day.
[131:32.57]You better be worth it because I can't catch you.
[131:58.09]This is so erratic.
[132:01.49]This is so erratic because it's so sluggish to move the thing up or down.
[132:09.02]They just don't want you to catch these fish.
[132:28.94]Please give it up.
[132:35.88]I could be here all day.
[132:46.01]That's a lot harder than it looks, trust me.
[132:50.33]Got something to say, Pam?
[132:53.23]Keep walking.
[132:59.80]This one doesn't want to move all over the place, just like the... Okay, fine.
[133:02.00]It's because it's a rainbow trap.
[133:06.52]That was easier.
[133:25.79]Yeah, see?
[133:26.09]These ones are easy.
[133:26.73]These aren't even moving.
[133:39.26]So here we go.
[133:39.62]Here comes another crazy one.
[133:45.59]It's like trying to fake me out too.
[133:46.97]See, it's like, I'm going up, going down.
[133:48.09]Jeez.
[133:48.19]21 inches.
[134:18.55]Time is almost time for bed.
[134:19.93]1.20.
[134:19.95]Getting close to bedtime.
[134:32.00]And then you give me the slugfish that doesn't even care.
[134:41.09]We can make a clean million.
[134:43.75]Just a clean million from that pike.
[134:51.88]Back to bed.
[134:56.00]Time for sleep.
[135:06.75]I really like these ones that just give up.
[135:10.85]The fighters are the hard ones.
[135:14.06]Well, take it easy, Tiger Lotus.
[135:15.52]Have a good sleep.
[135:16.76]Thanks for coming out.
[135:18.60]And those of you that... Anybody that's going to sleep right now, have a good sleep.
[135:21.72]Have a good sleep.
[135:22.64]Have a good one.
[135:23.81]Refresh your body.
[135:28.49]Have a nice refreshing slumber, as they say.
[135:38.84]Better not be trash in here.
[135:46.79]Ooh, Geodudes.
[135:48.61]Nice.
[135:53.44]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[135:58.59]Espoi.
[136:00.29]Espoi.
[136:03.73]Thanks for seven.
[136:04.45]Welcome.
[136:06.67]As I continue to butcher people's names.
[136:23.61]Enjoy your stay in the Jerma universe.
[136:27.74]It's so fun here.
[136:30.54]We catch fish.
[136:32.92]We just sit here and we catch fish.
[136:34.54]That's all we do.
[136:36.58]Isn't it grand?
[136:43.61]Okay, I thought that was a dead person.
[136:49.63]I thought I fucking caught a dead person.
[136:53.43]I was about to shit my pants.
[136:57.84]Nope, it's just a doll.
[137:06.74]Oh, you've riled up a dead guy.
[137:13.87]Dead guy git.
[137:16.25]Well, look at the way he's lying there.
[137:22.75]That's not a doll, that is a person that is deceased.
[137:27.15]New record for trout, cool.
[137:28.61]Look at this!
[137:29.89]Doesn't that look like a person is just... Like you hit him in the head with a hammer and that's how he landed?
[137:37.49]You smashed that guy in the back of his skull with a bottle.
[137:43.34]Well, I have something to give to the museum at least.
[137:45.94]Or should I give the dead doll to somebody?
[137:53.54]This is the last farmer.
[137:57.43]That's the guy.
[137:58.21]I just like fished up my old grandfather.
[138:00.45]That's morbid.
[138:02.87]Somebody like dumped him in the lake.
[138:16.33]I have so many fish now.
[138:22.97]And here comes Pam.
[138:25.19]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[138:30.45]Phelpsy97.
[138:33.40]Check it.
[138:35.10]Thanks for subbing.
[138:36.66]Welcome, Phelpsy.
[138:38.62]Is your name Phelpsy because you like Michael Phelps?
[138:41.64]Or is your name Phelps?
[138:44.07]Give us the backstory.
[138:44.85]I want to know the backstory on your life.
[138:55.49]Holy shit, that's 32 inches.
[138:58.91]Yikes.
[139:00.77]That's the biggest fish I think I've caught in the game so far.
[139:07.82]Alright, time to go to bed.
[139:16.84]Whatever I get here, that's it.
[139:20.99]Alright, guys.
[139:21.53]Let's go back to bed, let's harvest, and let's go...
[139:26.77]Attack the world.
[139:28.39]Let's go down in that deep depth of the caves.
[139:35.12]I'll do that later.
[139:36.14]I'll give the dead person to the guy later.
[139:44.28]Pikes can grow up to be six feet.
[139:47.67]In comparison, that doesn't seem very big, now does it?
[140:01.21]Don't forget to feed the dog.
[140:02.91]Alright, one last cast.
[140:08.41]I got enough energy.
[140:09.03]I'm fine.
[140:11.35]Alright, at the start of this new day, I'm gonna take a, uh, a bathroom break.
[140:16.72]I'll be back.
[140:23.00]And we'll begin.
[140:24.58]I just got trashed.
[140:25.26]Whatever.
[140:25.52]Who cares?
[140:28.12]So when this new day starts, I'm going to harvest the crops.
[140:31.60]Water.
[140:32.76]The plants.
[140:35.25]Actually, I could probably sell some of these fish.
[140:36.81]I don't need all of them.
[140:40.89]35 energy.
[140:41.33]25 energy.
[140:45.63]Sell the sunfish.
[140:48.90]I'm going to keep the rainbow trout.
[140:51.00]I'm going to sell all the sunfish.
[140:55.89]No.
[140:56.49]I'm going to sell everything but the pike.
[140:59.79]No.
[140:59.87]I'm going to sell the pike.
[141:03.33]Sell the pike.
[141:05.17]Sell the... Yeah.
[141:08.05]Okay.
[141:08.39]I got it.
[141:09.55]Sell everything but the rainbow trout.
[141:12.33]Because these might be worth a lot.
[141:19.06]Okay.
[141:24.08]So then I have 525 energy, which should be enough to get pretty deep.
[141:32.40]Okay.
[141:40.11]Put the artifacts in here.
[141:43.61]What do I not need tomorrow?
[141:46.51]I don't need the axe.
[141:49.73]I don't need any of these.
[141:50.61]I need the trout.
[141:57.80]Actually, take... Campfire.
[142:01.28]I mean, I've had this for so long.
[142:07.70]I'll put the trash in there.
[142:08.66]I don't care.
[142:09.70]Just go to bed and wake up and see what happens.
[142:14.83]7.30pm.
[142:16.67]Recycling machine?
[142:22.47]Oh boy, that's a lot.
[142:25.99]These pikes are worth so much money.
[142:28.84]I'm just going to go back there and do that for like 12 hours and make 10 grand.
[142:33.52]Why is it always 10 grand to me?
[142:35.24]Always 10 grand.
[142:44.90]We're positive here, guys.
[142:45.82]Okay, don't need the fishing pole anymore.
[142:56.69]These are ready to pick up.
[143:06.68]Didn't somebody want a radish?
[143:09.00]Can I give him one of the shitty ones?
[143:10.05]Okie dokie.
[143:22.82]I might even keep a couple of these to eat down in the dungeon.
[143:38.67]I just thought about the baby running into the wall again.
[143:40.99]I told you guys, I can't... It always creeps back into my head.
[143:49.47]Okay.
[144:07.76]Hey, I missed one.
[144:16.70]pickaxe trident fish we're going to take two of these one two and then I mean can I I want to split these up why can I not can I drag these please in different spots am I missing something here
[144:42.22]I just want to split them up.
[144:44.76]I want to take two with me into the dungeon and sell the rest.
[144:47.58]I'm like trying to right-click and hold.
[144:58.85]If I click on them, they just all insta-teleport.
[145:05.28]Dog's still alive without three days of water.
[145:07.42]He's fine.
[145:08.12]He's had plenty of water.
[145:13.21]Oh, whatever.
[145:13.57]Who cares?
[145:14.47]Sell the whole damn thing.
[145:18.83]Right-click in inventory.
[145:19.65]Yeah, I mean, it did.
[145:20.19]Oh, wait.
[145:21.92]You can't be in the... Okay, I get it.
[145:23.48]You can't be inside of your stash.
[145:27.66]I get it.
[145:28.00]It's all watered.
[145:32.42]Everything's all watered.
[145:33.28]Let's go.
[145:42.53]I fed the dog.
[145:44.75]He gets food and water.
[145:47.33]Look, I've been putting fish down in the dumpster.
[145:50.03]He can go in there.
[145:52.47]Calling it a dumpster does not sound good.
[145:53.83]It's not a dumpster.
[145:54.75]He's not eating out of a dumpster.
[145:58.50]The dog's not eating out of a dumpster.
[146:00.20]He's eating out of the grandpa can.
[146:03.74]Doesn't it sound better that way?
[146:19.84]Come on, I'm just trying to kill time.
[146:21.16]Now this is what I'm talking about.
[146:25.50]That's a lot.
[146:49.99]Look at that cash.
[146:51.00]Five grand.
[146:54.30]Five thousand dollars.
[146:59.54]On to the mine.
[147:00.26]Now, oh, actually, I have to, uh, bathroom.
[147:03.35]Taking a quick bathroom break.
[147:04.35]I'll be right back.
[147:06.93]See you in about two minutes.
[147:07.75]What do you want, dog?
[147:08.93]You want a treat?
[147:13.33]And no, I'm not muting the damn stream.
[150:12.37]Come here, Otto.
[150:13.03]Come here.
[150:13.99]Come on.
[150:16.51]Come on, dog.
[150:17.72]Hello.
[150:22.56]What a good dog.
[150:48.29]You've had enough of my loud bits.
[150:49.65]Not pee!
[150:56.58]You've got a rogue fire hose in your house.
[151:00.08]Now that would be funny.
[151:05.02]It's the drain pipe.
[151:07.18]I've already explained it.
[151:13.08]Right next to me here, right next to the microphone, there's a drain pipe.
[151:18.10]Don't worry.
[151:19.78]Don't worry about it, okay?
[151:21.19]Don't worry.
[151:23.39]What?
[151:24.51]You wanna see my face?
[151:26.29]You wanna see my face?
[151:26.97]Don't worry about it.
[151:32.59]Alright, let's go to the mine.
[151:50.61]No, not the... Not Shaw's.
[151:52.79]Oh, what is it?
[151:53.19]Stop and Shop?
[151:56.85]Don't go to Stop and Shop right now.
[151:59.45]Don't go to Whole Foods.
[152:00.39]Don't go to any... No, don't do that.
[152:02.54]Don't go to Walmart.
[152:09.08]Come back?
[152:10.76]No, there's no reason for a facecam right now.
[152:21.25]A facecam on this game would just make no sense.
[152:23.75]It's just me with a sleepy face.
[152:26.61]Leaning back in my chair.
[152:27.61]It would just be awkward.
[152:37.34]No, why would I come to ridicule you?
[152:42.18]I know, that's... whatever.
[152:44.32]Do what you want to do, man.
[152:45.14]That's fine.
[152:45.52]I don't got a problem.
[152:51.28]Chicken hair hype?
[152:52.00]Yeah, I mean, we're talking about the... I would say the only chicken hair streamer.
[153:00.21]Unless I've been... Call me mistaken.
[153:03.79]I could be wrong, but I believe I'm one of the only people with chicken hair.
[153:08.57]That is streaming right now, at least.
[153:15.94]Let's go all the way down.
[153:19.24]Dwarf scroll?
[153:23.41]What the fuck is this?
[153:24.67]I got a lot of weird artifacts.
[153:36.32]I'm not going to waste energy on any of this, the regular stone.
[153:40.42]Because I got a feeling when I get down a couple more rungs that I'll... Don't hurt me.
[153:49.80]I'm going to start to see more rare minerals.
[153:52.57]I hope at least that's the theory.
[153:55.91]That is the theory.
[153:56.81]Here's the minecart.
[154:02.51]I need iron.
[154:06.23]Copper ain't doing it anymore.
[154:07.23]Hopefully I can mine iron if I find it.
[154:16.71]Can't really do anything with this.
[154:23.17]Did somebody just do a press for if you want to see Jerma rumble for?
[154:26.44]Is that just, are we doing that right now?
[154:34.52]It's gonna come out.
[154:38.16]I'm just gonna put that in my FAQ.
[154:41.02]I talked about that yesterday or the day before.
[154:42.78]I'm definitely gonna do that.
[154:45.73]It ain't ready.
[154:47.49]But when it is ready, hopefully it will have been worth the wait.
[154:52.51]That's all I'm gonna say.
[155:01.04]And that's not gonna be ready for at least a couple months.
[155:05.12]So strap yourselves in.
[155:14.36]Let's keep going.
[155:20.97]Getting deeper into the mine.
[155:30.37]I'll break this just because I can.
[155:35.84]Why not, right?
[155:39.28]That's a new, that's a new enemy.
[155:42.32]Centipede fly.
[155:49.52]I'm not quite done here yet, am I?
[155:51.83]I mean, I'm kind of done.
[155:56.23]There's a copper down there.
[156:04.34]I'll get that and leave.
[156:08.30]Otto, are you tired?
[156:09.68]Are you really this tired?
[156:13.98]Why are you so sleepy?
[156:22.89]Let's go down.
[156:23.45]I'm gonna eat my first radish.
[156:29.45]Look at that energy soar.
[156:37.94]New milestone.
[156:40.06]That's good.
[156:50.74]Still looking for iron.
[156:56.37]What am I at, 15?
[156:59.31]What the fuck are those?
[157:00.35]Are those fossilized grubs?
[157:02.31]No.
[157:03.21]What is this, Binding of Isaac?
[157:07.43]The Binding of Isaac grubs.
[157:09.97]What is he doing?
[157:10.53]Ah, he morphed into that thing.
[157:15.71]Yucky.
[157:22.61]Oh, back to bed.
[157:26.04]Yeah, back to bed.
[157:26.84]There's a stupid way down.
[157:34.86]Did I miss the ladder?
[157:40.44]Where's the ladder?
[157:41.94]Where's the elevator?
[157:42.84]There we go.
[157:53.08]I need some more rare minerals.
[157:55.72]No more copper.
[157:56.36]I'm sick of the copper.
[158:07.77]All I see is stone.
[158:11.79]Finally, something else.
[158:22.24]Geodude.
[158:23.36]Excellent.
[158:26.86]Ow.
[158:36.88]Well, the areas are getting bigger, that's for sure.
[158:38.50]I want iron.
[158:44.10]I don't want this bullshit.
[158:47.70]Give me the iron.
[158:49.46]That I deserve.
[158:51.24]I deserve it.
[158:56.75]I deserve iron.
[159:01.56]There is a California iron by Paul Masson.
[159:05.54]Inspired by the same French excellence.
[159:09.68]It's fermented in a bottle and like the best French champagne, it's vintage, dated.
[159:14.88]Like Paul Masson would like, have wanted to.
[159:23.17]Uh, yeah.
[159:25.79]Radish number two.
[159:31.24]Jeremy, you're my favorite mayonnaise-themed streamer.
[159:33.62]Is that what you said?
[159:35.98]I try.
[159:36.36]I try to be as mayonnaise-centric as I can.
[159:39.12]It's important.
[159:48.13]Running out of food.
[159:52.79]Probably close to 25.
[159:53.25]I would say.
[160:10.06]The quest is to get to 40, but I'm not sure I'm gonna have the energy to get to 40.
[160:13.44]What am I doing?
[160:14.22]Don't hit him with that.
[160:25.32]Is that the first coal I've seen?
[160:27.46]Oh shoot.
[160:33.20]Because I need a lot of that, too.
[160:38.52]Alright, we're eating the first rainbow trout.
[160:39.94]I love how he jumps into it.
[160:45.34]He jumps to eat it.
[160:56.73]Show me the way to go down.
[160:59.69]I'll take down for 500 points, please.
[161:10.22]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[161:16.23]Sherbert.
[161:19.01]Sherbert, you are a delicious... Delicious... Oh, what's this?
[161:23.71]Topaz.
[161:24.89]You're a delicious blend of citrus and ice.
[161:27.91]And cream.
[161:29.11]Thanks for subbing.
[161:32.54]17.
[161:32.84]Maybe I might be able to get to 20.
[161:33.90]Welcome.
[161:38.52]Welcome.
[161:40.11]Much appreciated.
[161:41.73]How are you?
[161:44.75]Where is the staircase to go down?
[161:47.33]This is getting a little outrageous.
[161:54.83]Don't even tell me I'm a moron and I missed it.
[161:56.80]I probably did.
[161:57.30]I'm wasting too much energy here.
[162:19.43]Found it.
[162:19.85]I have so much stone, too.
[162:32.87]What time is it?
[162:33.37]Uh-oh.
[162:37.79]It's 12 AM.
[162:41.29]I'm so close to 20.
[162:49.72]I can't pass out down here, I gotta go.
[162:59.12]Let's go.
[163:00.29]Dammit.
[163:04.85]Hurry up.
[163:08.11]Back to bed.
[163:08.65]I wasn't even paying attention to the clock.
[163:19.39]I'm getting stuck.
[163:20.83]I'm going to pass out again.
[163:21.59]I have so much money on me.
[163:24.31]Can I sleep over?
[163:24.99]Please let me sleep over somebody's house.
[163:32.17]I'm going to pass out.
[163:33.23]There's no way I'm not going to.
[163:39.43]I'm going to pass out in front of my house again.
[163:43.01]I got too sucked into what was going on there.
[163:46.87]Damn it.
[163:51.35]I gotta just go in somebody's house.
[163:54.15]Somebody has to have an open door, right?
[163:58.18]There's a light on here.
[163:59.82]Pam.
[164:00.56]Pam, you gotta save me, Pam.
[164:01.56]Come on.
[164:07.82]I'm not gonna... There's no way I was gonna make it.
[164:09.12]I need to find, like, a safe place.
[164:10.92]Right next to the river.
[164:12.40]Behind the trailer.
[164:16.02]Don't rob me.
[164:16.81]Don't rob me.
[164:17.83]Please don't rob me.
[164:33.48]Somebody fucking took how much money?
[164:37.88]You took fucking $500 from me!
[164:52.89]Well, let's make it all back.
[164:56.91]What a town of fucking criminals, huh?
[165:09.16]Town of criminals.
[165:13.78]At least I can go to the beach.
[165:14.98]I'm gonna bring a hot pepper.
[165:16.06]I'm gonna stuff a hot pepper down fucking Mayor Lewis's throat.
[165:21.27]What the hell happened over here?
[165:26.34]What is this gas?
[165:27.26]What is this toxic gas coming over here?
[165:28.96]Oh, it's a cloud.
[165:36.71]I don't remember if it's... I thought it was gas.
[165:39.77]I thought we were getting gassed.
[165:48.87]Whatever, let's go.
[165:56.58]No, we still haven't fixed the road.
[166:04.61]Let's go.
[166:05.17]Let's bring some hot peppers to the beach party.
[166:08.01]Let me just throw this shit in here.
[166:18.91]Give me big money for this shit.
[166:22.26]Crab?
[166:22.60]Where did I get this crab from?
[166:26.58]I didn't have a crab.
[166:31.06]Yam?
[166:34.02]Did somebody go through my pockets and put stuff in them?
[166:37.84]Did the person that robbed me last night put a crab in my pocket?
[166:41.40]That's kind of creepy.
[166:43.28]Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna rob him and I'm gonna put a crab in his pocket too and it's gonna pinch him.
[166:49.89]Yeah, I didn't pick this up.
[166:59.27]Get this out of here.
[167:00.17]At least I didn't take any of this shit.
[167:14.40]That would have been depressing.
[167:25.91]I gotta clean out.
[167:26.61]There's a lot of junk in here.
[167:37.46]I'll sell it.
[167:39.14]Right?
[167:39.54]I mean... Should I bring the crab to the potluck?
[167:43.14]A live crab.
[167:44.80]No, that's probably worth money.
[167:50.06]I'll bring my rainbow trout.
[167:53.36]Water the plants.
[167:53.98]Don't forget to water those.
[168:02.39]I'm glad nobody breaks into your house in this game.
[168:13.79]Is it a corpse in the chest?
[168:15.01]Yeah.
[168:17.03]Had a little run-in with some dude.
[168:18.31]I had to knock him out and throw him in a chest.
[168:21.90]Harry Potter style.
[168:34.83]Doggone it.
[168:35.67]Doggone.
[168:40.31]These things are going to be good for me, man.
[168:42.37]Every four days, about $1,200?
[168:43.33]That's pretty good.
[168:48.87]It's pretty good.
[168:50.90]Good.
[168:51.60]Pretty good.
[168:52.80]Pretty good.
[168:54.34]Good.
[168:54.78]Pretty good.
[168:55.52]Good.
[168:55.76]Pretty good.
[168:57.04]Pretty good.
[169:00.62]Did I miss one?
[169:04.45]No.
[169:04.53]Where are they doing the potluck?
[169:07.87]Where's this special dinner?
[169:10.89]Is the mayor going to have clothes on?
[169:11.91]I hope so.
[169:14.83]I wasn't paying any attention.
[169:15.91]There was some potluck dinner.
[169:30.98]Is he open?
[169:34.30]Closed on Wednesdays.
[169:35.30]Oh yeah, you just walked out.
[169:40.84]Oh, the governor's gonna be there.
[169:41.88]Maybe the governor will be like me.
[169:44.22]I still can't believe.
[169:44.92]Why would you close on a Wednesday?
[169:46.10]That's so annoying.
[169:47.52]I'm gonna go back to bed.
[169:50.08]Is Pam in here?
[169:58.16]Let's visit Pam.
[170:01.51]Hi, Pam.
[170:04.96]Having a local farm is good for our town.
[170:06.51]Sure is.
[170:08.49]Can I interest you in a fresh fish?
[170:11.09]No, she's gonna hate it.
[170:14.41]There's no reason, no point.
[170:20.26]What do you have to say?
[170:23.42]Hey, farm guy.
[170:26.33]This is so condescending.
[170:27.49]Hey, farm guy, I have a question for you.
[170:30.17]Do you think I'll ever turn pro?
[170:32.89]You're destined to be a sports legend.
[170:34.33]Maybe if you practice a lot.
[170:35.49]No, you'll most likely fail and become a salesman.
[170:40.56]Okay, I need some help here.
[170:42.50]This whole town has been total ass.
[170:44.74]So do I tell this person just to screw off or do I give them a bunch of go for it and hopefully he likes me.
[170:55.41]I could get some brownie points here.
[170:57.33]I could get some good points with this guy.
[171:05.38]This is my only opportunity to have one friend in the whole town.
[171:10.36]I'm gonna blow a bunch of smoke up his ass.
[171:12.08]I need a friend.
[171:13.37]You're gonna be pro, dude.
[171:16.33]Yeah.
[171:21.17]You're cooler than I thought.
[171:22.31]See?
[171:22.43]He thinks I'm cool.
[171:23.51]Even though he's 0 out of 10 still.
[171:28.09]He thinks I'm cool, guys.
[171:30.07]I did it.
[171:31.99]I got the popular sports kid to look at me and like me.
[171:38.70]Look, this is my only chance to have one real friend in this town.
[171:41.86]Sometimes you gotta take it.
[171:52.90]Pull water on the electric socket while you're watching TV.
[171:59.85]Oh, isn't that nice?
[172:04.36]Alex is my grandson.
[172:05.26]Have I told you that already?
[172:06.28]You sure have.
[172:08.58]Maybe not.
[172:09.80]Whatever.
[172:11.46]Bye.
[172:14.20]Is that Alex?
[172:15.86]Hey, Alex.
[172:18.54]How are you?
[172:18.98]Oh, hey, did you find your pants yet?
[172:29.44]Moonlight jellies.
[172:36.54]What can I do here?
[172:38.90]It's giving me a hand, but it doesn't do anything.
[172:44.17]This place always seems to be open, but I can't do anything in this entire place.
[172:49.71]Whatever.
[172:52.57]I did not sell my peppers because this place is closed on Wednesday.
[172:58.52]Back to bed.
[173:03.79]Actually, I can throw them in the box.
[173:06.81]And back to bed.
[173:07.55]You know how it is, guys.
[173:12.83]Steel painkillers.
[173:14.37]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[173:20.58]It's Moose and Mills.
[173:23.02]Moose and Mills.
[173:24.56]Two people on that account.
[173:26.82]Moose and Mills, they share it.
[173:27.94]Moose and Mill.
[173:30.78]But welcome.
[173:31.26]Thank you.
[173:31.62]Appreciate it.
[173:33.00]Enjoy your stay.
[173:34.66]Enjoy the French champagne.
[173:37.18]It's being passed around as we speak right now, I would assume.
[173:45.68]Yeah, I made a friend today, guys.
[173:57.59]Get rid of the yam, too.
[173:58.39]Who cares?
[174:00.05]Back to bed.
[174:05.17]Oh, wait.
[174:06.25]Whoops.
[174:06.87]No, I have food.
[174:09.77]Oh, shit.
[174:10.31]Can I reach in here?
[174:13.26]Oh, fuck.
[174:16.04]What do I... I gotta whip something up.
[174:20.14]I can bring my rainbow trout.
[174:22.10]People love trout.
[174:22.74]Let's see how much money I got.
[174:30.21]Iron fence.
[174:31.27]Preserves jar and basic retaining soil.
[174:39.34]That is a lot of cash.
[174:49.89]Hey, I'm almost up to my 10 grand.
[174:53.00]Almost.
[174:55.02]Do I have any food?
[174:59.78]I don't really have any food.
[175:04.87]Uh, I guess I could fish and try to get something tasty?
[175:07.47]Maybe I can fish out another soda can.
[175:15.00]That would be swell.
[175:15.62]I need a TV upgrade.
[175:22.36]Yeah, that's later.
[175:24.02]That's not now.
[175:34.48]I don't have the money to do that right now.
[175:49.19]Hey, look at that.
[175:56.86]Time to go to the beach.
[175:59.80]With my $10,000 in my pocket.
[176:05.28]Sherbert.
[176:05.90]All these emotes.
[176:08.46]That's just the beginning.
[176:09.98]The whole solar system is going to be there.
[176:12.54]All the planets.
[176:18.01]At least the good ones.
[176:19.39]At least the ones we care about, right?
[176:20.87]You know, like Jupiter.
[176:23.89]Saturn.
[176:31.77]Everything starts at 9am, so...
[176:35.67]Great, a broken CD.
[176:47.06]Uranus.
[176:50.38]This is supposed to be open now, isn't it?
[176:53.00]What even is this?
[176:53.48]Is this an ice cream stand?
[176:56.25]Interesting.
[176:57.35]Interesting.
[177:08.16]God, fine.
[177:08.70]I'll just fish right here until 9.
[177:10.64]Yeah, Jupiter is probably going to take some work from what I've done and looked at it so far.
[177:27.33]I think I have the right idea.
[177:32.36]At least I hope I do.
[177:48.46]Let's check out the poison gas.
[177:52.90]I gotta get at least one more edible fish.
[177:55.24]Oh, this one's a... This one's a star.
[177:57.33]It's got a star on it.
[178:23.77]Come on, I'm late to the party.
[178:25.13]Alright, good one.
[178:31.10]Make this be a big succulent trout.
[178:34.06]Make it huge, too.
[178:34.74]I hope this is like a five-foot tuna.
[178:38.50]Thanks a lot, Wolf.
[178:40.63]Can we burn Wolf into the crowd here with Wolf H?
[178:46.51]Can we burn him in with the sun?
[178:57.16]What is this?
[178:57.88]They put... I don't want to eat out of that.
[179:04.01]They're making a giant Looney Tunes Bugs Bunny cartoon.
[179:07.55]Pot.
[179:09.71]Why?
[179:09.89]I'm gonna go in it.
[179:14.29]Oh, okay, I can put... I can really ruin this.
[179:17.07]Yeah, put some trout in there.
[179:20.03]Uh...
[179:22.45]Okay, I put a, I threw a raw fish in here.
[179:26.47]I have no idea what she's making, but I just threw a fish in it.
[179:32.64]Yeah, I did bring something.
[179:34.54]Just caught it.
[179:35.00]These blasted sand flies keep landing all the food.
[179:40.80]Oh, it's disgusting.
[179:42.56]It's just, it's just raw.
[179:44.08]Oh, people are dancing.
[179:45.15]Oh, what the fuck?
[179:45.87]Oh, it's my dance partner.
[179:47.19]Oh, it's my dance partner.
[179:52.63]Hot pepper chutney.
[179:53.33]Is that with my peppers?
[179:57.19]Cherry bomb.
[179:57.95]If I had one, maybe that would be funny.
[180:01.30]I would dance, but I don't want to get sweaty.
[180:05.02]Okay.
[180:07.32]Yeah, perfect weather for a beach party, bro.
[180:11.70]Oh, you stepped on my foot.
[180:14.09]She's just rocking out.
[180:17.23]Look at this.
[180:17.59]Just rocking out.
[180:19.13]She's unresponsive.
[180:22.24]Look at these two crab apples over here.
[180:27.23]Look at these two crab apples.
[180:28.47]Okie dokie.
[180:42.62]One year, Sam put a pound of anchovies in the potluck soup.
[180:47.10]You mean like kind of what I did?
[180:51.84]Can I eat something?
[180:54.16]Where's my food?
[180:56.08]Where's my candied yams?
[180:58.34]I was promised candied yams.
[180:59.58]Yeah, it is busy.
[181:04.80]Always busy.
[181:08.35]Oh, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[181:09.81]Interesting, yep, yep, yep.
[181:13.45]Yeah, oh yeah, that's true.
[181:16.64]The key to a good roast is slow, continuous rotation.
[181:20.93]Enjoy your giant corn dog.
[181:23.71]Bye.
[181:25.57]I'm going back to work.
[181:28.91]Where's the governor?
[181:31.35]Okay, wait, hold on.
[181:31.97]Wait, wait, wait.
[181:32.69]Spot the governor in the retro SNES-inspired game?
[181:37.90]Always a mustache.
[181:39.58]Always a coat.
[181:40.67]Always a hat.
[181:41.95]And he always has a completely different color than every... He's wearing something out of the ordinary, like purple.
[181:47.43]Oh, like purple!
[181:49.21]Hello, Governor.
[181:50.99]You seem to have a mustache.
[181:53.25]And you seem to be older, and you seem to be wearing a completely different color than everybody else.
[181:58.27]More than ever, your king, it is always a joy to be the star of your valley.
[182:01.49]There is speaking in this house about purchasing vacation over here.
[182:09.14]Should we move forward with the luau?
[182:10.78]The governor seems a little hungry.
[182:12.76]Yeah, let's go.
[182:13.16]Oh, he's gonna do the taste test.
[182:32.95]Well, folks, it's time once again for the potluck ceremony.
[182:35.99]I trust that you all put high-quality ingredients in the pot this year.
[182:39.15]We don't want the governor to regret his visit to the valley.
[182:41.59]Uh-oh.
[182:43.91]Was that trotting good?
[182:46.63]Well, governor, would you do us the honor of tasting the soup?
[182:51.28]Of course I've been looking for this all year.
[182:53.40]It's just a grosser version of this.
[182:56.12]Come on, you're going to like it.
[183:03.04]I love it!
[183:13.40]It's an average soup.
[183:15.52]Oh shit!
[183:16.42]Fucking governor didn't like it.
[183:21.08]Did I ruin the soup?
[183:25.29]Not bad, it's nothing special.
[183:27.85]I should have thrown chili pepper in there.
[183:31.03]Oh, he would have been like, oh, super spicy.
[183:32.91]I like it when it's spicy.
[183:34.65]I fucked up.
[183:40.92]I'm like a procurer of spicy.
[183:45.84]I could have really zinged it up, too.
[183:47.97]Fuck.
[183:49.01]I really fucked up, guys.
[183:56.33]Oh, well.
[183:59.31]If I only kept one hot pepper, he would have loved it.
[184:02.80]He looked like a real spicy food kind of guy, right?
[184:08.38]Hello, dog.
[184:13.80]I should have thrown trash in it.
[184:18.35]I should have thrown a dead body in it.
[184:24.55]Okay, should I reset and try to throw the dead body in the soup?
[184:32.62]Holy shit, there's a dead body in here.
[184:39.06]No, it's not even going to work.
[184:43.96]It's too late.
[184:44.56]I have plenty of money.
[184:46.46]Do you guys see how much money I have?
[184:48.24]Do you see how much cash I have?
[184:51.31]No, if I ever reset after... It's so long.
[184:53.37]It's such a pain in the ass.
[184:56.51]That fat mustached motherfucker liked it.
[184:58.51]He thought it was average.
[185:00.05]No, we're not doing it.
[185:01.57]We're not doing it.
[185:03.64]Alright, if the dog shows me a heart, I'm going to bed.
[185:14.37]Come on.
[185:20.40]Dog, you need to like show me some affection.
[185:27.24]Alright, let's throw trash in it.
[185:30.14]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[185:33.30]Okay.
[185:34.60]Let's do it.
[185:35.14]No soup for you.
[185:36.72]No soup for you.
[185:38.72]Thanks for subscribing.
[185:39.58]I'm going to throw trash in the pot.
[185:42.00]I have to see what happens.
[185:43.80]Thanks for the sub.
[185:44.84]Appreciate it.
[185:45.80]Welcome.
[185:47.18]Let's do it.
[185:48.16]What do I get to lose?
[185:49.74]I'm going to go throw garbage in the pot.
[186:00.61]I kind of have to do it, right?
[186:09.35]We'll try the body.
[186:12.28]And if that doesn't work, I'm going to throw trash in it.
[186:16.16]The fresh champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[186:20.58]Stereo sun three.
[186:23.56]Welcome to the trash soup.
[186:26.60]Enjoy your stay in the soup trash eaters.
[186:35.02]There's the money I had.
[186:36.08]Okie dokie.
[186:38.66]Make sure I bring the trash.
[186:42.80]Alright, what is even more disgusting?
[186:44.64]I'll try that.
[186:45.44]A shoe?
[186:46.06]No, the trash.
[186:46.80]It's just fucking trash.
[186:49.26]That's disgusting.
[186:51.94]Imagine if somebody dumped their old trash from the kitchen into your soup you were eating.
[187:01.30]Let's give it a whirl.
[187:10.18]If ever I made the case for everyone in this town to hate me even more, this is probably it.
[187:40.07]He's gonna hate it.
[187:40.83]What if he likes it?
[187:43.39]What if he likes it?
[187:44.19]Oh, something was added to this.
[187:48.35]It's just delicious.
[187:51.09]Now that will crack up if that happens.
[187:54.15]Alright, just in case I can't put it in, I'll bring the algae.
[188:07.01]Okay.
[188:11.82]No soup for you.
[188:12.56]Don't put me in the soup.
[188:14.82]Unless you want to be in the soup, I won't put you in.
[188:16.23]A lot of screens here?
[188:25.12]I'm not seeing any screens here.
[188:30.70]If you are, that shouldn't be happening.
[188:43.60]Was it?
[188:43.84]Yeah, it's today, right?
[188:49.48]You ready for the potluck?
[188:51.72]I can't wait.
[189:03.51]9am, right?
[189:11.53]Throw some weed in there.
[189:15.65]I am spiking.
[189:16.45]I'm throwing garbage into it, guys.
[189:21.27]I'm going to get this town condemned.
[189:23.33]Here we go.
[189:30.93]Okay.
[189:33.15]I can't put the trash in.
[189:36.41]How do we ruin the soup, then?
[189:39.91]I need algae.
[189:43.50]slimy.
[189:44.12]We're going to have to do the algae.
[189:45.26]Because it won't let me put trash or the dead body in.
[189:53.29]Just lay a dump in the soup.
[189:57.21]Alright, algae.
[189:58.23]Algae it is.
[190:02.95]It's really slimy and gross.
[190:05.83]Go for it.
[190:06.67]What a lovely occasion.
[190:07.67]Yeah, can't wait.
[190:10.81]Go.
[190:11.33]Taste it.
[190:16.64]Tell me how it is.
[190:19.52]How is it, sir?
[190:27.52]Did I ruin it?
[190:28.02]Been looking forward to this all year, apparently.
[190:35.77]You can only put one thing inside.
[190:37.37]You can't do more than one.
[190:39.49]Here we go.
[190:42.25]He hates it.
[190:42.83]He hates it.
[191:07.41]Okay, even if it was that bad... You don't... You can't say that.
[191:14.09]You can't say that.
[191:17.15]Um, it's actually kind of disgusting.
[191:19.46]I think I'll pass.
[191:23.52]Oh boy.
[191:24.16]Oh, he's gonna eat it too.
[191:31.82]Yuck, someone must have ruined it with a poor quality ingredient.
[191:38.03]Does anyone want any?
[191:47.12]That was great.
[191:49.14]That was great.
[191:54.77]It's actually kind of disgusting.
[191:56.95]Yeah, I'm like the Joker from Batman.
[192:05.73]I just, I do these things.
[192:07.81]I'm the joker.
[192:08.59]Let's go.
[192:17.87]Oh, hi, dog.
[192:19.68]What a lovely evening it was.
[192:27.50]You think I care?
[192:28.02]I got six grand on the bank.
[192:30.56]You guys care?
[192:31.72]I got six grand on the bank.
[192:35.48]Uh-oh.
[192:39.24]It's been so long since I've heard from you, dear.
[192:41.08]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[192:46.32]Vicious Matt.
[192:48.84]Absolutely.
[192:49.34]He's just vicious.
[192:52.82]Thanks for something.
[192:53.92]Welcome.
[192:55.12]Much love.
[192:57.22]Dear Greg, it's been so long since I've heard from you, dear.
[192:59.03]Things are the same as they were back home.
[193:00.29]I miss you very much.
[193:01.07]Love, Mom.
[193:01.41]P.S.
[193:01.53]I found an envelope with some money Grandpa left for you.
[193:05.74]And I get $500?
[193:06.22]I think that's a win.
[193:10.26]That's a double win.
[193:10.94]Alright, what do I need to do?
[193:13.00]Sprinklers, right?
[193:19.01]I still need to get iron.
[193:27.94]I guess I haven't progressed far enough down there to be able to get any reliable iron.
[193:35.60]Maybe I should upgrade the watering can.
[193:37.96]But what does it do?
[193:38.56]Is it even worth doing that?
[193:41.68]I'm not sure.
[193:43.44]Does it water, what, like two or three tiles at a time or something?
[194:01.57]It still doesn't have its shorts.
[194:04.47]Alright, let me get let me get rid of the dead body and shit and I gotta donate to the museum Alright, let's let's do a museum run we've got Let's do a geo dude run Get rid of all the artifacts we have I can just plant these who gives a shit who knows what it even is Okay, so we're going to the museum
[194:33.74]and then to the blacksmith.
[194:38.15]And we're just going to plant these seeds, food carriers, whatever they are.
[194:50.85]Oh, but I love the fact that people are just coming in.
[194:52.80]If you're just coming into the stream right now and you see that and we're talking about a dead body, you are probably asking yourself, how did this game take such a terrible turn?
[195:10.43]Blacksmith is right there, and nine.
[195:12.15]Let's do the blacksmith.
[195:21.22]Somebody just wrote, I am new to this stream.

[196:39.44]Is this worth it?
[196:46.10]No, not right now.
[196:47.46]I have enough money where I can decide what I want to do.
[196:57.21]Let's make some donations.

[197:25.14]Melons!
[197:28.96]Thanks, Captain Crunch!
[197:29.96]6996?
[197:29.98]Well, that's an odd number.
[197:39.56]6996.
[197:39.82]Wait, he doesn't want this?
[197:57.59]Did that not show up when I was here before?
[198:04.23]No, I was here.
[198:06.41]Okay.
[198:06.71]I'm really filling out this museum.
[198:19.10]It's an even number?
[198:20.30]No, I'm just saying it's like $69.90.
[198:22.46]Come on, I'm making an awful, awful, not even funny joke.
[198:34.10]I didn't even attempt.
[198:35.44]I just said, that's an interesting number, isn't it?
[198:42.58]That was a real joke.
[198:44.04]Scratch that.
[198:44.66]Swipe that from the record.
[198:45.52]Scratch it from the record.
[198:46.46]That wasn't a joke.
[198:47.92]That was a fake joke.
[199:00.19]Staying watered overnight.
[199:04.28]Should I get some wallpaper?
[199:20.58]Am I doing this right now?
[199:27.29]Am I dropping $6,000 on a pomegranate tree?
[199:37.56]Should I do it?
[199:41.51]Are we just saying six grand pomegranate tree?
[199:55.35]The amount of no's I'm seeing in this chat right now is outrageous.
[200:01.66]No, God, don't do it.
[200:03.36]Don't do it.
[200:04.62]Do not do it.
[200:10.71]I just want to blow it all.
[200:11.70]I just want to blow all this money.
[200:15.46]You know what I mean?
[200:16.14]I just want to go to Vegas and just blow it.
[200:18.32]No, I'll tell you what I am going to do.
[200:32.23]Corn, boys.
[200:33.75]We are corning it up.
[200:34.63]46 corn.
[200:46.06]Oh shit, I have no room for this.
[201:06.40]Clear this shit out, I got this.
[201:10.29]Alright, corn.
[201:11.19]Plant these in the summer or fall.
[201:12.41]Takes 14 days.
[201:15.02]12.
[201:15.96]I got time.
[201:16.80]And it can be in the summer or the fall.
[201:24.69]Let's line the place.
[201:26.95]And I'm going to make it smart this time.
[201:28.47]You want to see how smart I am?
[201:29.99]Watch this.
[201:31.21]Watch this real, just raw intelligence.
[201:35.09]Check out this raw, real intelligence.
[201:37.60]You're going to see it right now.
[201:42.28]We're doing a redesign.
[201:46.40]Here's the redesign of the field.
[201:49.22]Check this.
[202:00.41]We're not doing it over here.
[202:03.40]This is going to be where the melons are going to go.
[202:07.30]Corn is going to go over here.
[202:18.81]How do I regrow?
[202:19.79]I need so many scarecrows.
[202:22.85]Don't worry about it.
[202:23.85]I've got this covered.
[202:26.15]I'll get a dozen of them.
[202:27.37]I'll get a hundred of them.
[202:32.22]We're going down here.
[202:32.96]This is gonna be where the mountains are.
[202:36.58]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[202:39.86]A wizard just subscribed.
[202:41.00]Thanks a lot, man.
[202:41.74]Welcome to the family.
[202:44.02]Now we're clearing this whole thing down here and I'm gonna make a big cornfield down here.
[202:49.63]It's gonna be amazing.
[202:51.69]Trust me.
[202:54.19]Have I been wrong before?
[203:05.38]Start the clearing.
[203:12.06]Let's get rid of this ship.
[203:14.18]This is where my cornfield is going.
[203:24.90]Was 46 corn necessary?
[203:31.36]Of course it was.
[203:46.92]Gonna be nice and clean.
[203:48.56]Plenty of spaces.
[203:50.71]Please hit the wood.
[204:05.12]I got 46.
[204:05.66]I think there's enough space down here now.
[204:07.76]Go like right here.
[204:12.06]I'm gonna do one line.
[204:13.88]So we have 46. 46.
[204:17.90]Where's my hoe?
[204:18.73]There it is.
[204:20.83]So we're gonna go, let's go with three, four lines of 10.
[204:23.99]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
[204:36.06]One, two, three, four.
[204:43.27]Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[204:49.64]What are you doing?
[204:59.64]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[205:03.89]Hey, Murray's Bagels.
[205:08.35]Wonderful Murray's Bagels.
[205:10.71]The freshest in town.
[205:12.83]Thanks for seven.
[205:14.01]Appreciate it.
[205:15.04]Welcome.
[205:16.66]Enjoy your moons.
[205:18.48]And your suns and your earths.
[205:23.66]What is in the way here?
[205:24.44]I don't understand.
[205:29.87]Who's talking to me?
[205:46.83]Did my phone die?
[205:48.45]My phone just died.
[206:03.23]We're not planting anything yet.
[206:04.23]I'm not gonna plant until I have, like, four scarecrows.
[206:09.51]I thought this one through.
[206:13.12]I'm just getting it insituated.
[206:14.76]I'm getting it... What is in the way?
[206:19.84]No, I didn't want to do that.
[206:21.58]I did not want to do that.
[206:22.52]I just ruined it.
[206:23.12]I didn't want to do this.
[206:24.87]What is my hand hovering over for no reason?
[206:32.55]Like, I just wanted... What is right here?
[206:37.39]There's an invisible thing here.
[206:38.63]I'm going to bed.
[206:39.17]I'm going to fucking sleep.
[206:45.20]Good night.
[206:55.59]It's raining.
[206:58.07]That's good.
[207:02.37]I'll take my yield.
[207:14.86]It's fun to do this.
[207:15.60]Oh, I just got two out of that one.
[207:17.62]Oh, two.
[207:22.48]Okay.
[207:25.64]It's gone.
[207:28.38]It's gone.
[207:29.09]So this is going to work out.
[207:45.57]It's okay, I can enter through here.
[207:53.79]I can water from there to there.
[207:55.05]It's going to be fine.
[208:02.58]Why do I hear ghosts?
[208:03.88]Are there ghosts in this game?
[208:07.30]Listen to that.
[208:09.59]Am I being haunted?
[208:30.68]There are ghosts.
[208:32.06]Oh, that's scary.
[208:32.82]I just played a ghost game.
[208:44.70]Getting closer.
[208:48.39]Just need to make a few scarecrows.
[208:56.93]That just actually scared me.
[209:00.84]Can I get struck by lightning?
[209:01.94]I hope not.
[209:03.62]Oh my god.
[209:04.60]Hold on.
[209:22.45]10, 11, 12, 10, 11, 21, 22.
[209:22.89]Okay.
[209:33.00]I'm making the snake.
[209:33.66]10, 20, 30, 40, 1, 2, 43... 40... 43.
[209:38.16]I'll put the other two here.
[209:39.18]Dump those peppers.
[210:07.50]Is it a frog?
[210:09.70]Did you hear that?
[210:13.78]Get rid of these.
[210:21.73]Get rid of the clay.
[210:27.91]I don't care.
[210:30.23]Trash in there too.
[210:32.47]Somebody else's problem.
[210:44.25]Actually, I'm not going to use this yet.
[210:45.61]I feel like it's going to get washed away.
[210:46.81]Okay.
[210:53.22]I need scarecrows.
[210:54.02]I need a bunch of fiber.
[210:56.82]I think I have a bunch of fiber in my stash.
[211:05.31]I don't have a lot, but... I have the wood and I have the... What's my name?
[211:13.55]Cole.
[211:15.67]I have enough of one.
[211:18.47]We're holding off on this until tomorrow.
[211:23.83]Let's get the fiber.
[211:29.44]Give me some fiber.
[211:32.92]Here we go.
[211:41.34]Clean this place up.
[211:43.05]It's a pigsty.
[212:01.25]Should almost have enough.
[212:02.01]Hopefully.
[212:06.81]There's the hope.
[212:07.49]There's always the hope.
[212:13.69]Hit it.
[212:17.82]Is this Farming Simulator 1990?
[212:20.34]Close.
[212:21.68]It's Stardew Valley.
[212:26.58]More like Harvest Moon.
[212:30.10]I should have enough fiber.
[212:31.06]Oh, my shits are going to be fucking enormous.
[212:38.33]That was disgusting.
[212:39.11]Wow.
[212:40.33]Easy.
[212:42.79]Easy.
[212:43.25]53.
[212:48.12]It is 2, 4, 6.
[212:51.90]I should get some more.
[212:53.64]I need more.
[213:05.31]How big is the property?
[213:05.93]The property is enormous.
[213:08.01]It's very, very large.
[213:10.33]See, I'm like dipping into here.
[213:11.41]You can have gigantic farms.
[213:15.03]Super crazy.
[213:17.15]Really cool.
[213:29.32]Still need... I need 80 fiber.
[213:33.26]To make four scarecrows.
[213:43.40]And I'm also clearing this all out, which is good.
[213:47.74]At least somewhat.
[213:51.40]That got real close.
[213:56.45]That lighting struck right here.
[213:59.13]I really hope you don't get struck by lighting and die.
[214:02.11]That would really suck. 75...
[214:12.49]We're almost there.
[214:13.81]I promise.
[214:17.03]Eighty.
[214:22.11]Do I have enough wood?
[214:24.14]Five.
[214:24.88]Five, ten, fifteen, twenty, two hundred.
[214:26.46]I have way more than I need.
[214:28.38]I just need coal.
[214:29.30]Let's try to get some coal.
[214:33.18]I need three coal.
[214:41.91]Can I get coal out of these rocks?
[214:43.29]I hope you can, because I'm wasting my time otherwise.
[214:45.27]These are like a rare drop out of these.
[214:49.45]Something like that.
[214:53.77]It's not.
[214:55.55]There it is, coal.
[214:59.20]Coal, coal, coal.
[215:01.16]Come on, give me some coal.
[215:05.28]If I get struck by lightning, then... Yeah, I'm almost starving.
[215:08.40]Eat the algae, you feel better.
[215:14.42]Mmm.
[215:16.20]Tasty.
[215:16.56]I need two more coal.
[215:24.17]I need two out of this.
[215:26.23]Damn it.
[215:32.22]One, two, three.
[215:33.00]Do I have coal in the bank?
[215:34.20]If I do, then we can stop this nonsense.
[215:36.64]And I can move on with my life.
[215:45.04]Ah, my back is hurting.
[215:46.02]All this tilling and... Crowing.
[215:49.02]I have nine coal.
[215:50.66]Did not even know that.
[215:53.26]Well, here are... Here come the scarecrows.
[215:58.22]Four scarecrows.
[216:03.36]Let's go ahead and put them out.
[216:07.56]So it's eight tiles.
[216:08.48]Let's make sure I get this right here.
[216:10.82]So if it's ten, that means one can go here.
[216:14.12]Because that's one, two, three, four.
[216:18.19]One, two, three, four, five.
[216:20.59]One, two, three, four.
[216:21.63]I'm going to put two here.
[216:23.67]So I can go right here.
[216:27.82]And then right here just to be safe.
[216:30.56]And that should cover it, right?
[216:31.46]Because it's an eight tile radius.
[216:35.94]So it should be... It should be good.
[216:39.72]And then the other one goes over here.
[216:40.88]Because I'm going to turn this into the melon farm.
[216:45.35]One, two, three, four.
[216:46.19]Actually, do I need more?
[216:49.29]Do I need another one down here?
[216:50.47]I'm scared to plant.
[216:55.89]Just because.
[216:56.69]I'm going to put one here too.
[216:57.75]I'm terrified.
[217:05.24]I need more sap.
[217:07.56]I'll do it tomorrow morning.
[217:08.36]Time for bed.
[217:17.27]Goodnight.
[217:26.16]Already making the money back.
[217:44.06]She sent one to me!
[217:47.64]She mailed, she put a beer in the mail to me.
[217:52.42]No, fuck off.
[218:04.24]We gotta plant today.
[218:19.84]So, where's the corn?
[218:23.72]I can only do half-fertilized.
[218:25.82]Whatever.
[218:26.16]I can only do about half-fertilized.
[218:34.21]I'm running out of time in the summer.
[218:37.65]Put these fucking... See, who can't even know what these are?
[218:39.87]I don't even care.
[218:43.27]Who cares?
[218:45.69]Corn time.
[218:50.92]14, 14.
[218:51.08]I got time.
[219:12.17]I don't have enough time to make these better soil.
[219:14.23]Did I get behind him?
[219:27.25]Alright.
[219:29.51]I think we're covered with scarecrows too.
[219:37.84]Seeing that I can go around the snake.
[219:38.98]I don't have to step on anything.
[219:46.67]Don't worry about a thing.
[219:57.83]Is it gonna be pretty?
[220:00.15]What?
[220:01.23]The train's gonna hit my stuff?
[220:02.53]There's a train coming through here?
[220:10.23]All I saw was a train is coming and I heard the noise.
[220:12.43]I thought I was about to be hit by a train.
[220:18.28]Hey, weirder shit has happened.
[220:19.98]A meteor fell on my front lawn, guys.
[220:30.12]This is going to be such a good harvest, and it keeps going all the way through the fall.
[220:33.56]Oh, yes, yes, yes!
[220:38.38]I've put a lot of time into this game so far, just, like, playing and kind of dicking around.
[220:45.04]And it's cheap, too.
[220:45.64]This game's only 15 bucks, isn't it?
[220:51.81]I give this game four Burger Boys out of five.
[221:11.45]Why do I hear flies?
[221:12.23]Do I need to get bug spray or something, too?
[221:20.99]I probably should go check on the train that just came into the station, apparently.
[221:24.93]Let me come here.
[221:30.17]Can I pick him up?
[221:34.01]Yeah, come here.
[221:35.89]Just to be safe, I'm just doing this to be safe.
[221:40.24]We're doing this to be safe.
[221:46.76]I did that so I can still walk in here.
[221:49.56]I ain't getting any crows attacking these crops.
[221:53.32]Even though that's overkill.
[221:54.28]Don't care.
[222:00.62]If it's rated in Burger Boys, then sign me up.
[222:05.52]Okay.
[222:06.14]Now we have to deal with this.
[222:08.80]This situation over here.
[222:13.17]We got a little bit more corn.
[222:16.49]And melons.
[222:19.11]What a fucking mess.
[222:21.25]I can't wait till I get these because I think I'm going over those.
[222:24.36]Why did I do that?
[222:25.52]What is this?
[222:26.36]What is this line?
[222:27.20]This extra line?
[222:27.98]What are these three?
[222:33.98]Was I drunk when I did this?
[222:35.28]I don't understand.
[222:35.82]What the hell am I doing?
[222:44.51]Am I drunk right now?
[222:45.35]Because why did I just do that on the tiles that are not seated?
[222:51.93]I haven't even drank any... I drank a coffee.
[222:55.13]And ate food.
[222:59.09]Unbelievable.
[223:01.69]Unbelievable.
[223:03.83]Truly unbelievable, guys.
[223:08.20]I just wanted to go look at the train.
[223:12.52]Where's my Aliskir Crow?
[223:23.46]You know what happened there?
[223:24.41]I was so busy, annoyed at myself for having this shit here, that I've ruined everything over here.
[223:29.55]This is all gonna get changed.
[223:30.47]Don't worry about this.
[223:31.11]Don't pay attention to this shit.
[223:33.73]Pay attention to this side of the farm.
[223:38.23]This side of the farm is the good side.
[223:39.77]This is the side that, like, little Timmy came over and did this.
[223:46.16]My nephew decided to come over, and he's four.
[223:50.10]This is his side.
[223:51.82]This is my side.
[223:54.96]Except for this right here.
[223:56.22]This was a test.
[223:57.18]Let's go water the dog.
[224:04.05]And go check out the train.
[224:13.81]I'm going.
[224:14.22]I'm going to the train.
[224:14.82]I'm going.
[224:19.24]Up there.
[224:28.88]One side looks like shit.
[224:30.60]I know.
[224:30.86]And the other side is fine.
[224:34.30]I know.
[224:34.68]It's so bad.
[224:35.26]It's embarrassing.
[224:36.69]I'm embarrassed.
[224:43.29]Straight up.
[224:49.68]Oh, can I please have a K'nex?
[224:59.87]It doesn't.
[225:12.50]Who came in on the train?
[225:19.04]And where's the train?
[225:22.62]Did I miss the train?
[225:35.36]I missed the train.
[225:37.46]Is there a bathhouse here now?
[225:38.64]Like a spa?
[225:39.28]I'm gonna get smashed by the train.
[225:49.59]Anything in your barrels?
[226:05.69]This is new.
[226:10.74]There's the women's locker room.
[226:15.15]I just like went for the first door in my eyes and I was just like okay let's go in the women's.
[226:19.77]Oh let's get jacked.
[226:21.29]What is the purpose of this?
[226:35.73]Why does this exist?
[226:37.64]What?
[226:40.74]Alright.
[226:41.94]Sometimes you just gotta take a little load off.
[226:48.90]Go in the steam bath.
[226:59.72]You know, farming has its ups and downs.
[227:03.99]But I'll tell you right now, nothing beats lying down in the steamy, clean waters of the spa.
[227:33.70]Oh, my energy's going up.
[227:36.90]Look at that.
[227:43.89]That's cool.
[227:47.05]How come no one else is here?
[227:48.19]I want my spa friends.
[227:50.67]I want to stab my spa friends in the face.
[227:53.05]I want to do that right now.
[228:04.37]I want to go to a spa right now and go in the hot spa water.
[228:06.87]I tried to go in the women's locker room again.
[228:13.37]There's no indicator here.
[228:20.05]There is not an indicator there.
[228:21.33]Hit the showers.
[228:28.59]Aw.
[228:28.69]I didn't want to put my clothes back on.
[228:35.27]I can't do any lifting?
[228:37.94]This locker smells awful.
[228:39.34]Oh, that's gross.
[228:42.32]You're too weak to lift it.
[228:43.86]Bullshit.
[228:44.30]Oh, I got my energy back.
[228:51.13]There's nobody running this bathhouse.
[228:56.93]Hold on a second.
[229:02.42]Just a second.
[229:09.80]My curiosity has been piqued.
[229:14.22]What happens if I stay in here past 1.30 p.m.?
[229:22.71]1.30 a.m.?
[229:24.71]Will I just pass out in the spa?
[229:30.33]Am I just going to drown in the spa?
[229:37.45]I'm curious.
[229:38.43]I want to see what happens.
[229:44.96]Nobody's gonna find me in here.
[229:46.20]Nobody knows I'm in here.
[229:47.02]I need to know.
[229:52.56]Am I gonna turn into a gremlin?
[230:04.97]Why would you sit in here for four hours?
[230:10.42]Not even joking, I was watching this stream twice earlier and fell asleep both times.
[230:17.36]Well, we are playing Stardew Valley.
[230:27.20]I don't foresee a way anyone could find me in here.
[230:32.11]I'm the only person in here.
[230:34.75]Nobody saw me come up here.
[230:41.45]We don't have very much time.
[230:46.33]What did I miss?
[230:47.11]Why is he... What does that say?
[231:00.53]Won't be long now.
[231:08.49]Why am I in a sauna?
[231:10.27]That's a good question.
[231:10.83]I don't know.
[231:18.59]Also, part two of my query, why is this place open?
[231:27.65]This is an establishment that's just open past 11 or 12 AM.
[231:30.85]There's no worker that comes by to make sure nobody's in here.
[231:35.06]Is he going to leave me in here?
[231:43.64]Who maintains this?
[231:45.00]And why is it open at 1230?
[231:55.35]This used to be a farming stream.
[231:59.91]You're right, it did.
[232:01.07]It did used to be a farming stream.
[232:06.72]I spent an entire day in the sauna.
[232:09.02]Well, I needed to get relaxed.
[232:21.01]Alright, let's see.
[232:26.60]This is where the dead body came from.
[232:35.18]Alright, 130.
[232:35.98]Start the countdown.
[232:37.62]140.
[232:43.72]150.
[232:48.08]We're at the end of the line here.
[232:50.27]Here we go.
[232:57.27]What happened?
[233:03.17]Let's see what the note says.
[233:08.96]Dear Mr. Greg, last night a JoJo team member found you incapacitated.
[233:12.40]The medical team was dispatched to bring you home safely.
[233:17.74]Yeah, right.
[233:21.84]Yeah, right.
[233:25.99]Well, that was worth 150 gold.
[233:27.15]I'm going to make it all back in a few days anyways.
[233:33.36]Look at these crops.
[233:35.24]They're booming.
[233:53.57]Alright, I think I am going to get the new watering can.
[233:56.47]This is kind of driving me crazy right now.
[233:58.37]Maybe I should go back to fighting the monsters.
[234:07.34]Because then I can maybe make sprinklers and I won't have to do this anymore.
[234:17.02]Yeah, that's top priority.
[234:17.84]That's priority absolute number one.
[234:32.40]I got a whole nother thing of corn.
[234:33.78]Yeah, I have no energy.
[234:39.84]I'm going right back to bed after this.
[234:48.37]Am I even gonna be able to do this?
[234:49.27]Am I gonna make it before needing to go back to bed?
[234:54.44]Shit.
[234:57.00]Good thing I got this rainbow trout.
[235:09.14]Back to work.
[235:25.19]I'm gonna make a dozen sprinklers.
[235:28.52]It's gonna be an automaton.
[235:32.96]Automaton.
[235:42.11]Finally, geez.
[235:48.49]Hard day's work.
[235:49.47]Time for bed.
[235:58.65]This used to be a mayonnaise stream.
[236:01.14]Was it ever though?
[236:01.80]Well, automaton.
[236:06.84]Was it ever a mayonnaise stream?
[236:09.42]It was a potential mayonnaise stream.
[236:16.58]This has been like this forever.
[236:20.09]Whatever, I fucked it up again.
[236:21.21]It's staying there.
[236:24.65]Look at this.
[236:24.95]We got more... This is the best decision I ever made.
[236:33.51]Look at this yield.
[236:34.99]This is the reason why I'm still able to play this game, guys.
[236:37.43]These peppers.
[236:40.78]This is a cool 1500 gold every four days.
[236:43.60]Guaranteed.
[236:44.02]I don't have to buy anything.
[236:48.65]guaranteed and they're going right into the dumpster oh I don't want to do this again I don't want to do this again I have to do it again where's my like controller can I play this game with the controller
[237:23.51]My wrist is hurting.
[237:30.51]Let's learn the buttons.
[237:32.27]There we go.
[237:35.49]It's easier to water when you don't have to move your wrist around and click.
[237:40.14]Let your thumb do all the work.
[237:46.56]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[237:51.86]Almo P?
[237:54.07]Almo P. Can we see some fucking Earths in the chat, please?
[238:02.80]Welcome, thank you.
[238:05.90]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[238:11.98]Is it Almo P or is it Almop?
[238:16.48]The P was capitalized here.
[238:19.93]It's probably Almop.
[238:33.09]The corn's starting to grow.
[238:34.21]The corn's coming in nicely.
[238:35.25]There's a little... sprouts.
[238:45.64]This is so much better on my hands.
[238:48.86]After playing this game for, like, two or three hours, just click, click, click, click, click, click, click, Diablo.
[238:54.00]I keep missing, though, with the controller.
[239:09.63]I'll refill it.
[239:15.20]Aim for sprinkler.
[239:15.82]Yeah, that is priority number one.
[239:18.48]After today, for today, what we're doing is I'm going... This is bad.
[239:23.98]Guys, I might be in a perpetual cycle of never ending nothing.
[239:27.85]Because notice how long it takes me to water these and how much energy it takes me to do it.
[239:32.11]Right?
[239:33.37]I now cannot do anything for the rest of the day.
[239:36.80]I... I may have screwed this whole thing up because I only have half my energy to do anything.
[239:45.18]I need to get, like, energy drinks.
[239:47.52]Do they sell them?
[239:48.14]Do they sell, like, just raw energy candy or something?
[239:54.13]Yeah, I could go to the spa.
[239:55.71]That is exactly right.
[239:57.45]What is, uh... I need to figure out what buttons do what here.
[240:02.07]On the controller.
[240:02.67]How do I get to the map?
[240:11.45]Yep.
[240:12.03]Go to the spa.
[240:16.89]Spa, and then it's off to... What do I need?
[240:22.27]Where is it?
[240:24.41]Sprinklers.
[240:27.89]Copper bar.
[240:28.43]I need iron.
[240:30.03]I'm not even close to being near iron, I don't think, in the mine.
[240:34.74]We'll find out.
[240:44.05]I wish there was a better way I could see the map.
[240:48.35]On the controller.
[240:48.97]There's a faster path to the spa?
[240:54.03]Is there really?
[240:54.41]I guess I can go straight up from my house?
[240:59.13]I guess so, yeah.
[240:59.59]I didn't even know that.
[241:01.93]Iron is 40 deep.
[241:06.15]I could buy it at the blacksmith, but I don't really want to.
[241:07.95]Get out of the way, you motherfucker.
[241:10.41]I hate the town, and I hate you.
[241:11.59]I hate townspeople.
[241:16.00]What have you ever done for me?
[241:38.42]I have one iron.
[241:39.24]Yeah, I know.
[241:40.58]Pretty much worthless.
[241:43.51]Hostile.
[241:43.89]Jerma is hostile.
[241:44.95]No, these people all hate me.
[241:47.17]Everybody hates me.
[241:54.16]We have stopped being nice to the townspeople.
[241:57.26]All of them.
[242:00.14]They have collectively decided that I'm not worth talking to.
[242:09.96]They hate you because you're so hostile.
[242:11.52]I gave presents.
[242:21.67]Jerm is the zodiac killer.
[242:22.95]Raw fishes equals presents.
[242:40.76]I gave a little kid a copper nugget worth probably a hundred gold.
[242:48.96]Oh, he wanted toys.
[242:50.82]He wanted toys.
[243:03.21]They all wanted toys.
[243:04.29]I wanted diamonds.
[243:09.19]What?
[243:09.49]Train's coming.
[243:14.43]Train, train, train, train, train.
[243:17.92]Here it comes.
[243:20.04]I wanna ride the Pony Express!
[243:30.01]How am I still alive?
[243:41.06]Craig?
[243:43.26]Easy now, take it easy.
[243:47.51]Someone found you unconscious and battered.
[243:49.43]I had to perform an emergency surgery.
[243:53.76]Be a little more careful next time.
[243:55.24]Oh!
[243:59.35]Ooh!
[244:24.23]And just like that, it's as if it never happened.
[244:27.83]Alright!
[244:43.45]Mmm, that was a refreshing day.
[244:44.53]Oh, look at these, peppers!
[244:53.74]What's the name of the Christmas train?
[244:56.88]The Polar... What is it?
[245:00.08]What express is it?
[245:00.92]The Christmas Express?
[245:04.12]The Pony?
[245:04.68]No, the Polar... What is it?
[245:09.61]The Polar Express?
[245:11.37]What did I say?
[245:13.41]The Power Express?
[245:15.79]Polar Express.
[245:17.47]Right, that's what I was trying to say.
[245:27.00]Pepper Express?
[245:28.30]The Peppers Express?
[245:31.54]Dude, we got Peppers already.
[245:34.91]On our Peppers Express.
[245:59.37]Alright, we'll just scratch that one from the record.
[246:01.47]I just wanted to see what happened.
[246:02.43]If you get hit by the train nine times, you die.
[246:05.85]And the doctor has to perform surgery on you.
[246:08.59]For a thousand gold and five items removed from your backpack.
[246:15.01]Oh, you could just reset.
[246:17.70]The Pepperidge Express.
[246:22.08]The Puny Express.
[246:24.50]The Putrid Express.
[246:37.45]I'm going to go back to the spa.
[246:41.88]Go see the Polar Express.
[246:43.02]This time don't get run over by it.
[246:45.70]Hopefully this is the last time I'm going to need to do this.
[246:53.55]It isn't.
[246:54.23]It definitely isn't.
[247:12.44]God.
[247:12.86]I want to like go outside and run.
[247:17.32]I'm having a massive ADD episode build up where I just need to, I need to just go outside and like run around from doing this.
[247:32.21]Yeah, that's right.
[247:32.59]The train didn't even try to stop.
[247:34.86]You'd think that after you'd hit the same person nine times, you would at least hit the brakes.
[247:42.16]Apparently not.
[247:47.10]The Polar Express does not do that.
[247:53.53]Let's go to the spa.
[247:55.53]Now I can go up this way, right?
[248:04.22]I won't forget about the dog!
[248:05.88]Trust me, I know.
[248:06.66]Look at how happy he is.
[248:09.38]Look at how happy he is.
[248:21.33]Yummy grapes.
[248:28.76]Alright, where's the train?
[248:33.66]Well, the train came after I got at the spa.
[248:51.86]Let's do it.
[248:55.64]How long am I going to stream for?
[248:58.22]Um... Until I get bored.
[248:59.84]Maybe another hour or two.
[249:03.40]Depends.
[249:08.44]Remember you're too quiet?
[249:09.28]Raise your voice.
[249:14.69]Like madly?
[249:15.39]Meanly?
[249:21.25]Angrily?
[249:31.07]Let's go.
[249:33.21]We're refreshed.
[249:33.81]We're ready to rock and roll.
[249:36.89]Ready to rock.
[249:38.56]Ready to rock it.
[249:46.96]Here comes the Polar Express.
[249:53.96]I'll wait for it.
[249:54.48]Actually, I want to see what time it is.
[250:04.20]You guys are at a frozen screen right now.
[250:05.82]I apologize.
[250:21.37]10 o'clock.
[250:21.71]It's out.
[250:22.03]Wow.
[250:22.37]How long have I been streaming for?
[250:23.47]Is it actually 1020 right now?
[250:31.72]Holy shit.
[250:34.00]Maybe I'll stop sooner rather than later now that I realize what time it is.
[250:40.84]Interesting.
[250:49.78]Oh well.
[250:51.70]More than five hours.
[250:52.74]I forgot I played Layers of Fear before this.
[250:56.60]I completely forgot about that.
[250:59.42]Alright, let's go.
[251:05.64]No, I just alt-tabbed.
[251:07.68]To see the time.
[251:09.50]And I sat there for a moment.
[251:13.42]I lit your fire.
[251:14.09]Hey, dude that lives in the tent.
[251:19.55]Your fire's back.
[251:21.13]I'm fine, you don't care.
[251:25.21]Okay, time for the mine.
[251:27.07]Although I should probably fish.
[251:29.79]I got no time for that.
[251:31.36]I got to just try to get down to level 40.
[251:33.18]It's fast.
[251:34.80]I got a grape.
[251:36.40]I'm good.
[251:36.68]I got grapes.
[251:42.40]15 only, huh?
[251:46.82]We are not going for mining.
[251:48.26]We're not going to use any energy.
[251:49.74]I'm just going to try to find the exit.
[251:53.84]That's it.
[251:57.15]If I can find an exit without having to hit anything, that's what I want to do.
[252:05.15]But not so far.
[252:18.04]I hate how it's hidden.
[252:19.46]I wish it wasn't hidden on either rock.
[252:32.35]What did I just pick up?
[252:34.09]Stone?
[252:34.47]Wow.
[252:40.85]There we go.
[252:43.61]16.
[252:54.84]Sometimes it's underneath enemies.
[252:57.90]Like that.
[252:58.30]This is a new area.
[253:09.58]Just want iron.
[253:10.48]Wow, that's a big slime.
[253:11.40]I don't know what he does.
[253:15.22]He just kind of explodes into smaller little slimes.
[253:26.71]Sap?
[253:27.81]There's sap inside of you?
[253:28.83]That's odd.
[253:36.00]A pair of shoes.
[253:38.08]Rubber boots.
[253:41.94]Is there a way down?
[253:42.64]I don't care about any of these things.
[253:50.09]Gonna be underneath this guy.
[253:50.99]No, shit.
[253:57.35]Oh, back the fuck up.
[253:58.49]Is that stone?
[253:59.87]I haven't used very much energy.
[254:05.64]Hopefully I can get down to 20.
[254:10.58]Come on getting unlucky Really is it really gonna be underneath the last slime in this whole place Of course it is Might as well take the copper if I'm gonna take something
[254:47.50]Oh, guava.
[254:48.78]Got that guava.
[254:50.96]Nice.
[254:51.82]Picked up plenty of guava.
[254:55.82]Sweet.
[255:02.83]Nice, got it.
[255:06.61]Going for speed.
[255:08.65]Oh, cool, guava.
[255:13.58]Will you turn the right way, controller?
[255:15.56]What are you doing?
[255:16.26]Stop.
[255:16.76]Okay, what the fuck is he doing?
[255:20.94]Freakin' hell.
[255:25.97]Carrots.
[255:26.49]Oh, that's a cave carrot.
[255:27.37]Those are delicious.
[255:33.23]Eat it.
[255:36.01]Eat the grapes.
[255:38.45]Back in action.
[255:46.95]You little snake.
[255:54.81]Oh, freaking heck.
[255:56.31]Nice.
[255:58.75]Treasure.
[255:59.23]A job I got, guys.
[255:59.93]Look.
[256:01.09]I made it to 20 and I found myself a treasure chest.
[256:04.81]What's in this?
[256:06.35]Small steel sword.
[256:11.03]What are you?
[256:13.66]Four to eight damage.
[256:19.01]I picked this up so long ago.
[256:20.47]Is this like one of the best items I could possibly have found?
[256:24.55]Look at how much better.
[256:25.25]15 to 26.
[256:25.81]4 to 8.
[256:31.71]And that was in a treasure chest.
[256:36.53]That's disappointing.
[256:39.55]Fishing.
[256:40.67]Do I have a pole?
[256:42.53]I don't have my fishing pole.
[256:43.61]God, I could fish in here.
[256:44.77]Alright, remember.
[256:46.71]Floor 20.
[256:48.19]The floor with the Cheshire Trest has a... has a pond to go in.
[256:58.55]Hopefully we're getting closer to iron.
[257:04.74]We're almost at... 9pm, 8.30pm.
[257:08.18]I mean, like, crap.
[257:11.56]The heck?
[257:18.49]There we go.
[257:24.03]Even if 25 is the number I get to, at least that's more than halfway there.
[257:28.19]And I'll get it next time.
[257:31.41]And I can bring my fishing pole.
[257:35.92]Oh, that's going to be so awesome.
[257:40.10]Okay.
[257:41.72]Just club them to death.
[257:42.64]Who cares?
[257:55.18]Eat up.
[258:03.35]Not back to bed yet.
[258:06.71]We want to get to 25.
[258:08.78]Then it's back to bed.
[258:13.70]Perfect.
[258:18.43]24?
[258:20.35]Almost at 25.
[258:21.35]Yeah, I'm going early this time.
[258:27.80]Once I get to 25, we're going.
[258:31.26]Which should be any second now.
[258:35.56]And then we can count our money.
[258:39.09]Look at this room.
[258:40.61]Look at this room.
[258:46.77]What a terrible room.
[258:48.69]What a terrible room with nothing in it.
[258:50.11]Is that a new enemy?
[258:58.61]Or is that a... Can I pick that up?
[259:07.61]Inventory's full.
[259:10.21]Uh, eat these.
[259:11.38]I don't care.
[259:11.88]Just throw them away.
[259:12.40]Who gives a shit?
[259:17.55]Alright, I gotta go.
[259:18.97]Hopefully this is 25 right here.
[259:21.61]I gotta shroom.
[259:23.31]Red mushroom.
[259:28.84]Damn, I have to go.
[259:29.90]I gotta go.
[259:30.64]I gotta go.
[259:34.36]Midnight is the cutoff.
[259:35.44]That's when I turn into a pumpkin.
[259:48.58]Shit.
[259:52.54]Come on.
[259:53.72]Be underneath right here.
[259:57.52]No.
[259:58.70]I gotta go.
[260:02.92]I gotta go.
[260:05.41]I gotta go.
[260:08.87]Gotta go.
[260:09.67]Got it.
[260:10.63]Midnight.
[260:11.59]See you later.
[260:15.09]Get me home.
[260:24.63]Made it to 25.
[260:24.93]Make sure I'm going the right way.
[260:31.49]Because I get lost at night because everything blends together.
[260:35.43]God damn it.
[260:45.26]Back to bed.
[260:47.72]That was a pretty good day.
[260:48.61]I got to 25.
[260:49.23]I'm going right back.
[260:51.97]Water in the plants.
[260:53.03]Go to the spa.
[260:55.37]You know how it is.
[261:05.24]This is actually going to be close.
[261:07.76]I got to make sure I go the least resistance.
[261:12.58]This is going to be really close again.
[261:18.68]I'm bouncing up and down in my chair right now.
[261:20.28]I'm so scared.
[261:26.17]I made it.
[261:26.55]Are those watered?
[261:29.27]Yeah.
[261:32.05]Okay, we're good.
[261:37.84]Can make a healing potion.
[261:40.54]Tapper.
[261:43.86]Miner's treat.
[261:48.00]I got my money.
[261:49.42]I got my money.
[262:01.39]I've got a good cash flow going at the moment.
[262:07.58]Let me figure out what I can dump out here.
[262:12.32]Bug meat.
[262:13.26]Slime.
[262:15.94]Keep the carrot.
[262:18.36]Keep the cherry bomb.
[262:19.50]Here's the Earth crystal.
[262:22.75]I don't care about this.
[262:23.69]I don't care about this.
[262:26.41]And... A spotted mushroom.
[262:29.33]Minus 50 energy.
[262:30.47]Why would I want to eat this?
[262:33.21]Minus 50, should I sell it?
[262:36.73]Should I give it to the, uh, museum?
[262:38.39]Maybe I'll give it to the museum.
[262:44.82]Let him eat it.
[262:45.34]Mm-mm-mm.
[262:57.14]It's gonna be a harvest this winter.
[263:07.66]I need it for a bundle.
[263:08.44]Alright, I'll hang on to it.
[263:09.32]I'll put it in the stash.
[263:15.91]Hopefully this is one of the last times we're gonna have to do this.
[263:23.45]In fact, I might... I might end this stream... after I get to level 40.
[263:33.43]Or maybe somewhat before it.
[263:35.15]I didn't realize it was as late as it was.
[263:36.98]I thought it was like 7.
[263:37.74]It's like almost 10.30, 11 o'clock.
[263:43.08]We will continue another day.
[263:50.89]Ronnie, are you serious?
[263:52.93]You could poison the whole town and get a game over?
[263:59.03]That sounds remarkably detailed.
[264:04.55]For a game on Super Nintendo.
[264:07.15]Or was it one of like the DS ones?
[264:17.02]Yeah, what exhilarating gameplay you're seeing right now.
[264:22.58]I'm pouring water on green toupees.
[264:26.61]Just thrilling.
[264:41.41]I can't end stream until corn strat is proven to be viable.
[264:46.52]Corn strat is gonna be viable.
[264:50.02]I'm gonna get a huge investment return on this.
[264:53.50]Just you wait.
[264:54.16]Okay, they're all watered.
[264:55.86]Get up the spa.
[264:57.64]Man, what do these boots even do?
[265:01.36]What are these?
[265:03.08]Plus one of these things are terrible.
[265:08.49]Yeah, a lot of poison clouds today.
[265:09.71]A lot of poison clouds.
[265:28.02]Okay.
[265:30.76]I only have this one carrot.
[265:35.60]That should do though.
[265:36.56]I just want to get to 40.
[265:39.50]Don't really care about anything else.
[265:42.58]Let's go!
[265:50.88]Bring the old equipment of the Adventurers Guild.
[265:52.36]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[265:56.10]Yep, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[265:57.90]I got it, I got it.
[265:58.50]Don't worry, I'm going back.
[265:59.28]I'm getting it.
[265:59.70]Everyone calm down.
[266:01.02]I'm going to get the fishing pole.
[266:08.73]He forgot me, dog.
[266:10.35]I didn't forget about the dog.
[266:12.15]Watch.
[266:13.39]I'm going to come out here.
[266:13.99]I'm going to give him a succulent salmon.
[266:19.45]Fishing pole.
[266:22.66]Okie dokie!
[266:26.14]There you go, dog.
[266:29.12]This is special water.
[266:30.20]I got this from... ...Tolin Springs.
[266:34.55]There's delivery.
[266:41.31]So what do you get when you get to five?
[266:42.39]That's what I wanna know.
[266:48.39]Ruff!
[266:57.89]Oh shit.
[266:58.37]No, I'm going the right way.
[267:13.12]I'm going to the spa.
[267:23.12]I love how I have to do this every day now until I get sprinklers.
[267:27.57]What a stressed out person.
[267:31.50]If you have to go to the spa every day for three hours a day, you've got a pretty stressful life.
[267:41.18]I just need to sit here and soak for four hours every single day of my life.
[267:57.19]Oh, more like one hour, but still, you get the point.
[268:06.58]Here we go.
[268:09.75]Let's go to the pond at 20.
[268:10.45]I want to see what kind of fish are in there.
[268:12.97]Curious.
[268:20.26]Well, you know what?
[268:20.68]If it was free, this is free.
[268:25.18]I probably would do this every day if it was free and right down the street from my house.
[268:32.76]Can I go... I can walk down this way, right?
[268:35.51]If I go down to the carpenter shop.
[268:39.47]Can I actually just keep going this way?
[268:43.37]Does this connect to anything?
[268:44.27]I don't think I've even gone down here, no.
[268:55.63]It's right here.
[269:00.51]What am I getting stuck on?
[269:01.57]Stop getting stuck.
[269:09.92]Okay guys.
[269:11.58]Time to fish in the level 20 fishing hole.
[269:20.14]I'm excited.
[269:21.85]What could it be?
[269:27.28]I actually don't know how to do this on a controller.
[269:28.68]Let's hope I get it right.
[269:35.62]Okay, that's not how you do it.
[269:38.66]That's how you do it.
[269:44.18]It's not a spa without a random floating band-aid?
[269:48.91]That's disgusting.
[269:50.93]But you're probably right.
[270:06.58]Is there any fish in here?
[270:10.49]Or is this the algae pond?
[270:26.16]Come on.
[270:31.24]It's just algae in here.
[270:41.79]White algae?
[270:45.27]There's gotta be something in here.
[270:47.37]This wouldn't be here if there was just algae in here.
[270:49.23]I'm just gonna cherry bomb it.
[270:59.12]Maybe I need a better fishing pole.
[271:00.26]Yeah, that's true.
[271:02.87]Give it one more go.
[271:04.73]I'm gonna cast it max.
[271:16.33]I look really sad when I'm fishing facing the camera.
[271:20.18]I want to see.
[271:29.34]Trash.
[271:36.66]It does look kind of sad.
[271:38.36]Glasses?
[271:39.76]Alright, that's it.
[271:40.64]Last one.
[271:41.45]This is just a bunch of garbage in here.
[271:42.97]I'm going to come back with a better fishing pole.
[271:48.84]You can't cherry bomb all your problems away.
[271:51.22]Well, who says who?
[271:56.54]Yeah, that's it.
[271:57.03]No, one more.
[272:10.11]Got one.
[272:11.07]I knew I should have done one more.
[272:11.99]It's going to be an octopus.
[272:19.40]This one, this one's a fighter.
[272:23.04]What is it?
[272:25.08]A ghost fish!
[272:27.16]Oh, okay.
[272:27.96]Now I'm staying here.
[272:29.92]I know I can get ghost fishes.
[272:38.77]Who's my favorite founding father?
[272:40.03]Really?
[272:41.09]You don't know what that is?
[272:42.63]Benjamin Franklin.
[272:43.51]We got another one.
[272:44.05]Oh, I'll have to be another ghost.
[272:46.87]I'll have to be like a 50 inch ghost fish.
[272:51.51]Oh, 24-inch Ghostfish!
[273:06.38]I need to get three Ghostfishes.
[273:15.87]Come on, you have to get three.
[273:18.35]Three strikes and you're out.
[273:19.63]Three outs change the inning.
[273:24.24]Three ghost fish.
[273:27.40]Three blind mice.
[273:31.38]The three amigos.
[273:46.30]Hit.
[273:48.44]We got a hit.
[273:50.34]It's gonna be a ghost fish.
[273:51.32]It's gonna be a gold ghost fish.
[273:53.36]Come on.
[273:56.76]Oh, that is 36.
[273:57.97]It's a gold ghost fish.
[273:59.09]I told you.
[274:00.33]Oh, I feel so satisfied.
[274:03.35]Gold ghost fish.
[274:04.29]36 inches.
[274:06.13]I will take like 500 gold for that.
[274:09.47]You know what I'm saying?
[274:13.57]Oh, look at the time.
[274:14.23]I have to leave.
[274:14.95]Yeah, I have to like leave.
[274:21.80]Okay, bye.
[274:22.42]That was fun getting the ghost fishes.
[274:35.20]We're going to sell the ghost fish.
[274:36.10]We're going to see how much it was worth.
[274:40.22]And then, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to end the stream.
[274:46.89]I feel like we accomplished some things tonight.
[274:53.11]You know, we made our pepper fields, endless supply of cash, and we got our corn strategy going.
[275:00.79]Corn strats are happening.
[275:04.85]I think there was a lot of progress.
[275:12.47]And it's been like six and a half hours.
[275:19.41]You know what's something I wish?
[275:21.93]Now this is, I mean obviously this game, I like this game a lot.
[275:25.17]I think it's really fun.
[275:27.21]This crafting menu is kind of a mess.
[275:32.10]Is there a way I can make it so I can see?
[275:35.58]Like, put these in different, like, wood, steel, different categories, because it's kind of just like, like, here's everything you can possibly make in one page.
[275:44.63]Is there, like, a, is there a button I can press to sort them?
[275:50.05]Because you have, like, rings, scarecrows, chest, uh, there's fertilizer, there's a tapper over here.
[276:02.93]I feel like there's probably a button or something I can press to make it so it doesn't do that.
[276:06.71]But that's really my... That's not even a complaint.
[276:10.16]That is a .5% complaint.
[276:18.12]Yeah, I had fun with the luau.
[276:19.38]Alright, let's see what this is worth.
[276:28.63]I'm curious.
[276:30.96]A rare ghost fish, guys.
[276:33.34]A huge one.
[276:39.03]I'll keep the algae.
[276:39.75]I can eat it.
[276:42.69]Do I have anything else?
[276:44.23]No.
[276:44.95]Alright, I'm going to see what it's worth.
[276:47.46]And then this stream is going to end.
[276:52.70]Moment of truth.
[276:59.80]a rare that's nothing I I could look just to be completely and totally transparent with this whole thing I sold regular just shitty pikes from the river for almost 200 gold a piece and you tell me a rare almost 40 inch ghost fish from 20 meters down into the dungeon is only worth 67 gold
[277:29.57]I'm glad I spent a whole day doing that.
[277:32.20]I got more money from throwing away bug meat and slime than I did getting ghost fishes.
[277:41.82]Whatever.
[277:42.68]When you lose, hey, you win some, you lose some, right?
[277:45.18]Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.
[277:48.82]But that's going to be it.
[277:51.56]Thanks a lot, guys, for sticking around.
[277:53.66]We've been here the whole time.
[277:56.46]It was about six and something hours.
[277:57.96]Six hours, I guess.
[278:00.42]But yeah, thanks everybody.
[278:02.36]I hope you enjoy the new emotes.
[278:04.25]Some more are coming.
[278:04.95]We're going to fill out the whole solo system at some point.
[278:11.87]Much love, much respect.
[278:13.23]Take it easy.
[278:14.82]Go enjoy the rest of your nights.
[278:17.94]Ta-ta for now.
[278:42.07]Okay.
[278:43.51]We're okay.
[278:44.03]That was a little spooky, but you know.
[278:47.29]We're fine.
[278:49.55]What the fuck is going on?
[278:50.89]I just saw two different screens.
[278:53.11]I just got lost because I turned around two times.
[278:56.45]I thought I was actually going crazy.
[279:01.83]Damn.
[279:03.26]Stop.
[279:03.96]What the fuck?
[279:09.26]What direction am I even facing anymore?
[279:15.13]We're going to keep doing this.
[279:21.21]I'll do this all day.
[279:29.19]I'm going to come here.
[279:29.93]Hold on.
[279:31.63]Come on.
[279:31.93]You've got to take a bath.
[279:38.67]I didn't like taking baths when I was a kid either.
[279:46.87]Alright, fine.
[279:50.91]Just know that tomorrow morning before school, you're going to be mad because you didn't take a bath.
[279:56.15]What the fuck?
[280:12.33]What the fuck?
[280:14.88]Why?
[280:15.48]Why?
[280:15.56]This is supposed to be a scary game.
[280:40.20]I need to like stop the stream for a second.
[280:48.51]That kid just ran right into the fucking wall.
[280:57.49]I did not expect that to happen.
[281:07.80]Is that gonna happen again?
[281:08.94]I swear to God if that happens again.
[281:11.92]Oh my God, hold on a second, hold on.
[281:15.92]Wait a second, wait a minute.
[281:18.36]Wait a minute.
[281:19.88]It's gonna happen again.
[281:30.31]The French champagne has always been celebrated for sexiness.
[281:35.59]I can't do it.
[281:37.09]I can't take it.
[281:43.49]Who just subscribed?
[281:50.58]It was even better the second time.
[281:52.08]I don't even know who subbed.
[281:53.13]Hold on.
[281:53.49]Hold on a second.
[281:57.81]Hold on a minute.
[282:00.25]Camactically.
[282:01.21]Camactically.
[282:02.27]Thanks for subbing, dude.
[282:08.86]How did I do that again?
[282:09.90]Oh, shit.
[282:11.88]I want to do it again.
[282:13.44]I want to do it again.
[282:23.42]I think I'm gonna die on camera.
[282:26.40]I think I'm gonna die on camera.
[282:28.06]Oh my god.
[283:09.02]It's broken.
[283:09.88]I broke my fucking laugh bone.
[283:12.32]I can't do it.
[283:13.06]I can't even laugh at it anymore.
[283:18.89]I can't even fucking think.
[283:38.58]I gotta get like five to come out at the same time.
[283:43.22]I feel like the asset is loading right here.
[283:46.04]You know what I mean?
[284:02.99]I can't even fucking imagine why you would have to do this.
[284:12.37]I can't even process why you would have that.
[284:19.38]Scary game.
[284:23.34]We gotta go.
[284:23.80]We gotta move on.
[284:24.52]We gotta go.
[284:25.62]We have to move on.
[284:26.44]I can't do it anymore.
[284:30.94]My whole body hurts.
[284:38.12]I gotta highlight that.
[284:40.66]I gotta highlight, like... I'm gonna take, like, the first part of the game, and how scary it was, and then just, this is the end.
[284:47.15]I wanna just walk into her.
[284:54.39]I- no, we gotta...
[285:13.54]I can't fucking believe that shit.
[285:15.86]I can't fucking believe it.
[285:23.15]I can't fucking believe that that happened.
[285:27.73]It's time to go.
[285:28.41]See you later.
[285:40.55]Why is it making me so happy?
[285:42.02]It shouldn't.
