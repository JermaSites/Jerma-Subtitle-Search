[00:06.96]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[00:09.78]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:13.24]This is going to be a live commentary, though.
[00:15.81]It's going to be a live commentary with four people just messing around, having a good time with the guys from MethodGaming, PwnStar, MLC_St3alth, and Enad, playing as the Soldier and then the Sniper in the next gameplay.
[00:28.09]Two pretty good gameplays.
[00:29.05]I probably could have done normal commentaries on them.
[00:31.81]So enjoy, everybody.
[00:33.05]The live commentary will be kicking in right now.
[00:37.51]None of us are good at YouTubeing.
[00:38.55]No!

[00:50.36]Well, what was that all about?
[00:51.88]I fucking washed my shit, dude.
[00:54.04]I went through the wash wrong.

[02:38.60]I was only there for, like, four, five.
[02:40.80]Bullshit.
[02:41.66]It's the same thing, like, when a fucking whore calls herself an escort.
