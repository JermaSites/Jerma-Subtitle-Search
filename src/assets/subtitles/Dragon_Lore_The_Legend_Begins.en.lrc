[00:38.91]What's happening?
[00:45.48]What's up?
[00:47.65]Getting in with a surprise stream today.
[00:53.18]I know I said maybe Monday or Tuesday, but today was the day.
[01:00.33]Hope you're having a good day.
[01:01.23]Hope you're having a good time.
[01:02.21]Hope you're having a good weekend.
[01:10.33]When are you going to play Casino Inc.?
[01:13.60]I don't know.
[01:15.34]On somebody's birthday.
[01:16.94]That's certain.
[01:23.05]The day that I play that, it will be someone's birthday.
[01:31.73]And what a birthday present that will be.
[01:39.97]That actually kind of... That's kind of, like, sad.
[01:43.97]In a way.
[01:46.02]Like, I didn't get you anything.
[01:47.42]That's, like, such a cop-out to... Oh, hey, dude!
[01:50.37]Wait, it's your birthday today?
[01:51.57]No way!
[01:53.21]I got you... This stream!
[01:56.50]Oh, whoa!
[01:58.82]Look at... Wait, let... Hey!
[02:08.67]Yeah, I got you this.
[02:21.42]What's the lore behind a Sunday stream?
[02:23.68]I don't think there is lore.
[02:26.61]Is there magical lore that I don't know?
[02:31.95]Oh, you got me this?
[02:35.59]Yeah, that's the... I forgot about somebody's birthday, so I'm gonna make the day about them, and they... I'm gonna spin it that... I'm spinning it that the day was for you.
[02:46.36]I don't know you.
[02:51.23]Happy birthday, Big J. Hey, thanks.
[03:00.28]How would you react if you went outside one day, looked up into the sky, and there was a gigantic version of your face?
[03:09.00]I don't know.
[03:10.92]How would anybody react to that?
[03:14.28]I feel like every single person would have the exact same reaction to that.
[03:18.21]Why do you need my response to this?
[03:22.27]If you walked out and saw your face up there, you'd probably do the same thing that I would do.
[03:27.16]You'd go, what the fuck is going on up there?
[03:30.32]What is that?
[03:31.48]Is this somebody playing a prank?
[03:36.25]Is this a joke?
[03:37.87]If it's not a joke, then why?
[03:39.31]And then you got to go through all the literary, the who's, the what's, the how's, the why's, and the when's.
[03:47.25]Who, what, where, why, how, when.
[03:49.97]Go through all of them.
[03:58.68]Everybody has the same reaction to that.
[04:01.59]It's what on Earth is going on?
[04:09.76]My reaction would be, oh no, it's starting to hit.
[04:16.80]I wasn't prepared.
[04:17.42]I thought I had at least 10 minutes to go get the fucking mail.
[04:21.36]Oh.
[04:23.11]Oh, I'll get the mail tomorrow.
[04:31.48]Anyways.
[04:33.64]How you doing?
[04:40.98]How you been?
[04:42.37]Good?
[04:43.99]We're going to play something today that I've had in my catalog for a very long time.
[04:50.13]This is the game that came out for Windows.
[04:53.80]It came up with the 3DO.
[04:55.68]I actually was going to play this on 3DO, but I figured, hey, wait, it's actually just on GOG.
[05:00.89]It's on DOS, I think.
[05:02.73]So I feel like that would be easier to capture than doing the 3DO.
[05:10.24]So this is a 3DO game.
[05:14.27]It's on GOG.
[05:15.47]On GOG.
[05:16.17]For real?
[05:23.80]What?
[05:23.92]Dude, you're 40?
[05:25.07]Yes, a lot of you guys are going to wake up to the fact that I'm probably a decade or more older than you.
[05:31.52]Hold on, I have a question.
[05:33.08]At what age do I cross where I'm not cool anymore to you?
[05:36.96]Do you know what I mean?
[05:38.78]I think that's going to happen soon.
[05:40.08]I think eventually when I'm like 40, I think a lot of you guys are going to be like, I don't know, man.
[05:46.66]He's a grown up.
[05:48.06]He's not cool.
[05:50.14]Good.
[05:50.42]I don't want to be cool.
[05:55.65]You were never cool.
[05:57.14]Oh, please.
[05:58.40]Have you seen how I look in sunglasses?
[06:01.63]Especially when I ask a question to somebody and they droop down to the bridge of my nose and I'm like, excuse me, where can I find the chapstick?
[06:09.62]That's fucking cool.
[06:23.64]Are you aura farming?
[06:32.22]OK, but yeah, this is Dragon Lore.
[06:34.19]It is a old point and click adventure game.
[06:37.89]It's a first person game.
[06:38.97]There's combat.
[06:39.81]This game looks crazy.
[06:42.68]And I figured I was like, you know what?
[06:43.68]I could play water park sim, but I kind of want to start with this.
[06:46.92]See how this goes.
[06:51.21]You think the Ravens are going to win?
[06:56.94]I don't know, dude.
[06:57.48]Quote the Raven.
[06:58.34]Nevermore.
[06:59.36]That's my answer.
[07:08.56]Wait five more minutes, please.
[07:09.78]I have to go.
[07:10.38]Well, why are you announcing that to everybody?
[07:15.28]You could have said, hey, dude, sorry, BRB, bio.
[07:18.79]Oh, hey, guys, sorry, bio.
[07:28.91]bio break okay is it weird for me to say that if you say by saying bio was supposed to be this sort of cleaned version of saying I'm gonna go piss or I'm gonna go shit here's the problem with that though I feel like if you use bio you are going to take a shit because oh I gotta take a piss I'll be right back I gotta go pee that's not a big deal that's fine everybody understands that
[07:52.55]But if you say, oh, hey, sorry, guys, bio break.
[07:54.41]It's like, oh, well, the only reason why you're doing that is because you're shitting and you don't want to say that to anybody.
[08:05.81]If you have to pee, I got to go pee.
[08:07.47]It's like, oh, yeah, of course, pee.
[08:11.52]Bio.
[08:12.90]Oh, you're not just saying pee.
[08:16.35]There's only two other options of what that could be.
[08:21.42]What about number one and number two?
[08:23.00]I think that's... I don't like that either.
[08:28.31]That's weird.
[08:29.03]I don't like that.
[08:31.37]Oh, hold on.
[08:31.63]I'll be back.
[08:31.97]I have to go to number two.
[08:34.17]No, dude.
[08:34.76]Just say you have to go to the bathroom.
[08:37.18]I'll be right back.
[08:37.62]I gotta go to the bathroom.
[08:41.44]What did that person even say?
[08:44.12]The chat message that we're talking about here.
[08:46.49]What did they say?
[08:51.71]Did they say I have to go to the bathroom?
[08:54.03]I don't remember what they even said.
[08:57.86]Alright.
[08:58.46]Anyways, dragon lore.
[09:00.20]I don't know.
[09:00.86]I'm probably going to be live for not super long, but at least probably a few hours here.
[09:07.43]I do want to keep playing Waterpark Sim.
[09:12.86]Does this person exist?
[09:14.30]I think so.
[09:15.90]Right?
[09:16.68]They did.
[09:17.64]Somebody said something.
[09:22.41]Alright, here we go.
[09:23.41]We're going to watch the intro.
[09:25.07]It could be a little crusty.
[09:26.45]The audio could be kind of crunchy.
[09:27.79]Just be aware of that.
[09:28.80]I think it sounds fine.
[09:30.86]But the game is from like 1994.
[09:36.28]And it's going through whatever emulation or whatever it needs to go through through DOSBox to get it to... I'm just saying be careful.
[09:42.71]Why am I doing that?
[09:43.69]Alright, here we go.
[09:50.57]This is Dragon Lore.
[09:53.08]We're going to view the intro.
[09:54.34]I did turn it down, so maybe I'll turn it up a little.
[09:56.94]Alright, here we go.
[09:58.06]You ready?
[09:58.36]I caught the first 10 seconds of this intro.
[10:03.55]Good luck understanding a fucking word that's being said, by the way.
[10:09.46]Fourteen wings for the dragon race.
[10:14.93]One of them is yours.
[10:16.12]No idea Is it too quiet?
[10:38.38]You'll see
[10:58.09]This looks like a dream I had.
[11:12.72]Oh wait, it's gonna be a 1v1.
[11:15.85]They're Roblox walking to 1v1 each other.
[11:18.05]This is gonna be great.
[11:22.49]That's a quintessential Roblox RP walk.
[11:26.66]What the fuck was that?
[11:27.40]Was that a person?
[11:27.94]Was it a baby?
[11:45.87]What is this?
[11:49.03]Oh, you just summoned a bunch of monsters!
[11:51.53]No!
[12:00.78]I love that guy on the left.
[12:02.16]That's like my favorite character.
[12:11.77]Uh oh.
[12:17.80]Is he gonna kill him?
[12:28.34]Yeah, that's definitely dad.
[12:30.08]That's definitely dad.
[12:33.70]So we're the, what, the prince?
[12:43.19]Dude, hey, don't bring me here.
[12:45.64]Why is he bringing me to, like, the Skull World?
[12:47.70]Oh.
[12:51.98]Dragon Lore Part 1.
[12:52.88]The legend begins.
[12:53.75]A game by Cryo.
[12:54.97]Directed by... Oh, there's a lot of names I can't read.
[12:59.81]Hey, we got credits in the first... They don't do it like this anymore.
[13:02.70]We got credits in the beginning again.
[13:03.98]We get the entire credits.
[13:10.42]I hope there's a button I can press to have this go up whenever I want.
[13:18.08]They gotta have a dragon swoop in from back behind those mountains and just blow fire right at the camera going while it flies through.
[13:27.98]The story continues in Dragon Lore Part 2.
[13:34.70]Wait.
[13:36.79]Did we see the ending cutscene?
[13:40.21]I hope that wasn't the ending cutscene.
[13:41.97]That's supposed to be the intro.
[13:45.24]I'm going to turn it up a little.
[13:48.83]Be warned, this game is old, and turning this up is probably a bad idea.
[13:53.14]Here we go.
[13:54.36]Start game.
[13:54.76]You ready?
[13:55.54]You guys ready?
[13:57.60]Walk in.
[13:59.24]Let's go.
[14:02.93]That's exactly why I fucking turned it down.
[14:05.67]That's the exact reason.
[14:13.42]I think that's me.
[14:14.02]Yeah, that's definitely me.
[14:23.20]Dude, he's good.
[14:23.95]He's good.
[14:29.49]Uh, alright.
[14:36.18]Oh, I hope the game's not broken.
[14:39.85]What are all these animal sounds?
[14:41.33]What, we have turkeys?
[14:43.75]Why do we have tur- oh, okay, hold on.
[14:48.96]Okay.
[14:50.52]Now it's too loud.
[14:55.05]I don't know.
[14:59.83]It's actually... Let's go down just a little bit more.
[15:08.15]We have so many animals.
[15:09.21]Alright, so I need to find some milk.
[15:10.59]A milk pail?
[15:17.85]Too many animals!
[15:21.05]I love the cursor though, it's great.
[15:25.19]It's a sorting algorithm of birds!
[15:28.48]Was that a hammer?
[15:29.82]Oh, nice.
[15:31.82]What do I do with this?
[15:35.37]Do I have an inventory or am I just holding a hammer?
[15:46.79]The cow can't wait all day, boy.
[15:49.41]Find me something to replace the pail.
[15:52.49]Alright.
[15:53.11]Alright.
[15:54.48]How do I put this in my inventory?
[15:58.06]I will admit I did just try to kill this guy.
[16:00.04]Okay.
[16:00.44]I'm not going to lie to you.
[16:05.25]I think we're both on drugs.
[16:07.15]I don't see any animals.
[16:15.49]Can I go out?
[16:19.10]Oh.
[16:20.26]Ugh!
[16:27.49]Can somebody give me some controls?
[16:29.95]I need to read this.
[16:30.89]I just woke up from a dream where you were doing a monster taste testing stream with me and Kryken.
[16:36.52]You and Kryken.
[16:37.96]You kept calling me a pussy every time I slipped on a normal monster and would slap it out of my hand.
[16:42.99]What are you talking about?
[16:43.77]Why do I have to read this?
[16:48.95]Oon is one of Krykan's friends.
[16:50.28]They stream together.
[16:54.75]Why did you have to stream?
[16:59.48]What a pussy.
[17:17.14]Alright, I need to pay attention to this.
[17:18.52]This music is way too loud.
[17:19.92]The animals are in tune to the music!
[17:37.15]Oh shit, what is that?
[17:39.28]What is that?
[17:39.84]Is that a cow?
[17:41.66]What the fuck is that?
[17:46.68]Is this supposed to be a dog?
[17:47.87]I can't go this way.
[17:55.82]I need to find a pail.
[18:01.67]Oh, a cow.
[18:05.46]Hello?
[18:11.44]I need to find a... I can't take it anymore.
[18:15.16]I can't take the fucking birds.
[18:17.71]In beat to the music.
[18:23.66]Did anybody see a pale?
[18:35.06]I gotta get out of this.
[18:43.57]What about this way?
[18:53.65]I don't see a pail.
[18:55.35]There's another dog.
[19:12.41]Okay, where am I?
[19:13.89]Finally.
[19:15.13]Oh, hold on.
[19:15.95]I think this might be somebody's house.
[19:17.85]Is there a pail?
[19:23.22]That was a fucking old bone.
[19:24.70]I have no idea even how I got here.
[19:46.73]You're going to rage at this.
[19:49.08]I just need to find... I gotta find the bucket and we're good to go.
[19:56.67]Hold on.
[20:00.87]There's no sliders.
[20:02.40]It just is what it is.
[20:20.43]The birds are so annoying, I hate hearing them in the morning.
[20:22.90]Alright, well we don't gotta go that far, man.
[20:31.58]It's probably gonna be right next to the house, right?
[20:38.19]It's probably gonna be right around the corner from the house.
[20:50.79]Like, it's gonna be right here.
[20:53.15]Can I go in the house?
[21:01.30]Ah!
[21:03.14]What's going on?
[21:08.39]Ah!
[21:10.11]Why is he... Why did he do that?
[21:13.76]I'm supposed to be his fucking grandson.
[21:15.94]What?
[21:21.99]What happened?
[21:22.71]What the fuck just happened?
[21:28.34]Did I throw it at him?
[21:29.56]I was trying to go in the house.
[21:32.42]Isn't he supposed to be my uncle or my grandfather?
[21:35.03]We have to start the whole game over.
[21:45.06]Okay.
[21:46.22]Where is the bucket that this guy wants so bad?
[22:01.97]What a weirdo.
[22:04.73]This dude has freakin' caked up pants.
[22:06.61]What are you talking about?
[22:07.62]Okay.
[22:14.46]Alright, alright.
[22:15.18]Is there a bucket right here?
[22:16.09]There's a sword!
[22:22.75]I- Oh yeah!
[22:23.84]I gotta go fight over the sword.
[22:25.72]How do you equip the weapon?
[22:28.42]I'm gonna hit tab.
[22:29.30]Shift.
[22:31.04]Left click.
[22:37.07]How do I, how do I hold items?
[22:38.55]I don't think there's any instructions.
[22:48.05]You are currently holding it.
[22:51.76]But how do I, there's gotta be like an inventory, right?
[23:08.29]You need to Google it.
[23:12.75]Well, I'm going to put these together.
[23:13.73]Alright, I don't see a bucket anywhere.
[23:19.86]I would imagine it would be right here.
[23:22.00]It's the first quest of the entire game.
[23:24.75]The entire game.
[23:26.99]They wouldn't put it too far, right?
[23:28.59]It would be next to a tree or...
[23:41.53]Maybe it isn't just right here.
[23:52.27]Okay, I gotta remember where I'm going.
[23:54.54]I gotta remember where things are.
[23:56.02]I don't see anything here.
[24:13.31]I googled it and holy shit, chat, he will never make it to the bowl.
[24:16.95]Why?
[24:17.41]There is an inventory.
[24:27.30]Oh shit, is there?
[24:27.98]How do I use it?
[24:28.96]One, two, tab.
[24:31.62]Space, control, alt, shift, enter.
[24:35.25]Backspace.
[24:37.01]C. Right click.
[24:40.67]F1?
[24:41.63]No.
[24:44.88]Right-click the bottom of the screen.
[24:53.73]Bring it up on your- it'll bring it up on your gut- G?
[24:57.18]G. Top left?
[25:02.79]Oh shit, look!
[25:09.62]Oh, hell yeah!
[25:10.62]Okay.
[25:11.36]Wait, I can pose my character like an action figure?
[25:16.49]Alright, I gotta go.
[25:17.07]I'm going to... Alright.
[25:18.45]I know.
[25:18.67]I got it.
[25:19.61]Let's go back and get the sword.
[25:20.47]Does he give me a hint on where it is?
[25:39.13]Oh, now everyone's in big trouble now.
[26:07.75]But I have a sword actually equipped.
[26:12.52]How do I use it?
[26:16.47]Okay, it's right-click to swing.
[26:18.15]Maybe I can clear the path?
[26:29.00]Can I put this like a warhammer?
[26:30.81]Okay, can I put this in like a sack or something?
[26:40.46]Oh, great.
[26:41.26]Please don't fuck up the game.
[26:43.38]Okay.
[26:43.50]Alright, I'm saving it because that's progress.
[26:51.84]You can store items on the right side of the screen.
[26:57.67]Oh, hell yeah.
[26:58.43]Let's go.
[26:58.99]Alright.
[27:00.15]Let's do it.
[27:08.57]Okay, I'm gonna say we have to clear one of the paths.
[27:17.06]Left or right?
[27:20.42]Go right.
[27:23.41]I am gonna get the milk quest done.
[27:34.78]Okay, let's kill this thing.
[27:36.88]Right?
[27:40.23]Should we?
[27:52.38]Do I have a health bar?
[28:08.07]I think it's dodging?
[28:12.76]Alright, how many times do I have to hit this thing?
[28:19.41]Oh, shit.
[28:20.13]It's dead.
[28:26.12]Does it have any items on it or anything?
[28:32.15]Okay, well this is a... There's a bucket!
[28:34.41]There's a bucket!
[28:34.91]Bucket!
[28:35.47]I got it!
[28:37.38]Yeah!
[28:40.60]Anything else in here?
[28:43.61]Why was I so excited about that?
[28:48.98]I bring the bucket back to uncle.
[28:51.12]I thought he was blocking my path.
[29:10.32]If you've given the dog the bone... Oh, I don't know.
[29:13.19]That's a good question.
[29:15.55]Okay, here we go.
[29:27.36]Here.
[29:32.55]Okay, I think...
[29:41.27]Can we go in the house now?
[29:49.10]What's that?
[29:50.34]Cheese?
[29:51.48]Money?
[29:51.70]I don't know.
[29:54.41]We're taking it, whatever it is.
[30:01.62]Anything else to examine?
[30:02.84]Rope.
[30:17.35]Right click, right click, right click, no.
[30:21.46]Stick.
[30:27.18]Right click, it would be a disaster.
[30:29.09]Can I kill him, though?
[30:30.91]Like, can I kill him?
[30:32.71]What is this?
[30:36.38]Oh, hell yeah!
[30:37.18]I have Minecraft armor.
[30:41.32]I'm taking this guy's stuff off the... This is like an heirloom, isn't it?
[30:45.77]This is a decoration.
[30:46.75]Is this even real?
[30:58.48]Okay.
[30:59.12]Well, I want to get prepared for my quest.
[31:16.58]Can I go and open the chest?
[31:22.95]I don't think I can open the chest.
[31:25.67]Alright, let's go get the cow.
[31:31.92]Save the game.
[31:40.71]What am I doing?
[31:44.42]Why am I swinging it like this now?
[31:52.15]Oh, you can pick what side you want to swing.
[31:59.77]How do I raise the shield then?
[32:11.32]Should be equipped.
[32:14.67]That's definitely equipped.
[32:19.87]Alright, where's that cow?
[32:22.39]Hey, there you are.
[32:24.56]Get back here.
[32:33.85]What does it want me to do?
[32:34.73]I think it's asking for like an item.
[32:36.77]Maybe the rope?
[32:42.16]Yep.
[32:46.91]Wait.
[32:50.53]Is the cow just following me now?
[32:51.87]What if it gets attacked by that thing?
[32:56.03]No, fuck!
[33:00.60]Is that thing gonna attack us?
[33:02.58]I gotta be ready.
[33:09.74]I think it's just implied that the cow is following us.
[33:28.92]I'm riding it.
[33:35.31]Alright, I did it.
[33:40.37]Task is done.
[33:42.08]Huh?
[33:42.52]Where's the cow?
[34:02.21]Bring it to the pasture.
[34:06.20]What the hell is that?
[34:07.12]I have to tie it somewhere?
[34:13.31]There was a cutscene with the cow and then the cow is just not here anymore.
[34:22.91]The cow was right here.
[34:36.25]Bring the cow to the pa- where's the pasture?
[34:39.40]I don't know, everything is a pasture, it's all green!
[34:43.11]They have the cow equipped on the left side of the screen in the video.
[34:48.84]What?
[34:49.61]Is it fucked up?
[35:13.71]Then he said nice downloadable cursor from like 2000.
[35:23.54]Hey, that actually would be a sick cursor.
[35:26.95]Okay, so what do you want me to do now?
[35:30.87]Okay, so here's the rope, right?
[35:34.18]Okay, this is what worked last time.
[35:38.52]We get a cutscene.
[35:41.75]The cow is walking towards me.
[35:45.76]I don't have, the cow's gone.
[35:48.98]Where's the cow?
[36:00.39]Lasso needs to be in your hand, maybe?
[36:03.84]There's another fenced area that's, but is the cow technically with me right now?
[36:15.40]Oh, I thought it was supposed to be equipped.
[36:17.47]Okay, well, alright, well, let's go.
[36:23.77]I think I have to kill this thing.
[36:37.27]Oh, shit, I think it got me.
[36:48.31]Please don't kill me.
[36:58.24]Pastor?
[37:03.69]That does not look like a pastor.
[37:15.24]We're not going this way.
[37:16.54]What about this ancient chest?
[37:28.74]VRJosh showed me a screenshot.
[37:30.30]The cow is supposed to be to my left right now.
[37:38.99]Walking with me.
[37:54.39]Is this it?
[37:58.27]Is this it?
[38:00.42]Hey!
[38:07.61]Okay, now we did it.
[38:14.46]Very exciting.
[38:15.20]Okay, here we go.
[38:17.83]Cow is here.
[38:19.99]Quest complete.
[38:21.63]I almost right clicked and I was about to be really sad.
[38:35.42]Get me the hell out of here.
[38:41.71]Get me out of here.
[38:42.55]Oh, I need you to go find me a bone for the stew.
[38:58.97]Where would I find a bone?
[39:00.59]Alright, I'm going to actually get that because I probably actually need it.
[39:07.87]I don't even, I have no idea where it was.
[39:09.27]I think it was back in the pasture, but whatever.
[39:12.65]It was just progress.
[39:22.34]Is the cow gonna escape?
[39:24.07]Better not.
[39:24.55]Spent all that time.
[39:30.73]The six second music loop is crazy, by the way.
[39:34.66]It could have been like ten.
[39:38.04]Six seconds is crazy.
[39:41.71]What is the matter with you this morning, boy?
[39:44.67]What?
[39:45.43]Bring the cow.
[39:47.25]Oh, fuck off.
[39:48.76]I have to tie the cow to something.
[39:52.30]Oh, come on.
[39:53.76]Six is crazy.
[39:59.53]No, no, no, no, no.
[40:03.44]No, no, no, no, no.
[40:07.28]Alright, how long is it?
[40:17.18]What the fuck?!
[40:28.29]Can't I just reload the save?
[40:30.35]Whatever.
[40:41.46]Just hurry up and go, I'm- I don't even- Where- Is the cow still gonna even be there?
[41:11.63]Alright, get over here.
[41:21.34]Come on, let's go.
[41:28.60]This way.
[41:40.06]Okay, almost there.
[41:56.45]This loop is like when you walk by a section of a museum or of a amusement park that has, and this is the way that it was back in the Renaissance time.
[42:08.55]This is way back in medieval times.
[42:10.01]Did you see the animatronic is getting the milk and putting its arm up and down?
[42:15.04]And you're supposed to walk by this.
[42:16.68]Oh, look, there's the farmer and there's the son and there's the cow.
[42:19.62]They're all animatronics.
[42:21.48]You walk by this and it's in your... It takes about 15 seconds for you to look at the plaque and go, oh, that's interesting.
[42:27.61]Life in the fucking medieval times.
[42:30.42]And you walk by it.
[42:31.72]You're not supposed to stay in there for more than five seconds.
[42:34.38]You're already past it, and it's just the next people get the loop, and it's, oh, that was a... That was a nice song.
[42:40.55]I got it for the amount of time I was supposed to get it for.
[42:45.52]Somebody else said flash game music.
[42:59.15]Yeah, and workers have to listen to that all day.
[43:01.33]I think there should be a hazard pay.
[43:03.95]think that's hazard pay I think that you should get on your paycheck every week every two weeks how much you get paid at an amusement park there should be hazard pay for listening to the same track over and over again okay we're good now the cow's not gonna move
[43:38.81]We talked about amusement park rides and, no, don't go in there.
[43:42.24]Oh, it's so diabolical.
[43:43.66]And we've put a line in front of this guy.
[43:45.14]I've talked about that.
[43:47.56]But the fact that every eight minutes you have to hear, no, adventurers, don't go in there.
[43:54.03]Oh, you cannot.
[43:55.42]It's so dangerous.
[43:56.74]The evil resident ghoul will be in there.
[43:59.94]No, travelers, you can't go in there.
[44:04.19]The evil resident ghoul is in there.
[44:07.19]You must turn back.
[44:09.12]No!
[44:09.86]Traveler!
[44:10.64]You hear that all day.
[44:13.86]On the big screen.
[44:20.01]And I'm gonna repeat the joke, because I think it's funny.
[44:22.49]I think it's... I love it.
[44:23.45]I love this joke, and I'm gonna say it again.
[44:26.56]Because, you know, some people weren't here when I told it.
[44:29.34]The fact that you put... This guy's warning us so desperately to stay away.
[44:35.78]Look at, we're not prepared for this.
[44:38.75]Turn back.
[44:39.67]It's too scary.
[44:41.27]And we put a line in front of this guy and are charging people to go by him while he desperately tries to save us.
[44:48.32]We have put a line in front of this guy.
[44:50.75]We've made an amusement out of this guy.
[44:52.47]And all he's trying to do is help us.
[44:58.48]What are you all doing?
[44:59.48]Why is everybody here?
[45:02.16]Why are you all standing in line waiting to go in?
[45:04.75]Don't you know the ghoul is in there?
[45:07.41]Are they listening to me?
[45:08.45]Wait, can I have some money?
[45:11.54]How much are you charging for this?
[45:14.06]How many gold pieces?
[45:21.67]Today's my birthday?
[45:27.23]What is it?
[45:29.18]What did he give us?
[45:32.50]It's a booze canteen?
[45:54.82]Is that what he's giving us?
[45:57.41]What is this?
[46:03.55]Oh wait, it's this stuff.
[46:11.36]Should I put it on?
[46:11.94]Is it a ring?
[46:15.70]The Vaughn Wellenra Dragon Ring.
[46:19.99]I'll put it on.
[46:20.55]A whistle.
[46:28.71]Alright.
[46:29.93]Well, what do you want me to do?
[46:35.60]I swore not to tell you any more than I have.
[46:39.60]And that is the way that it has to be.
[46:42.41]My advice to you is take whatever you want from here and then head for Castle Van Wallenrod.
[46:51.66]Okay.
[46:53.04]Somebody said drinking age in medieval Europe.
[46:57.21]And then they Omega lulled.
[47:01.38]Yeah.
[47:03.14]Okay, well, let's save.
[47:07.31]I think I have to go through the skull place now.
[47:17.50]Your uncle does not give a fuck about you.
[47:23.52]He was sworn not to tell me my true, my true lineage.
[47:28.76]I don't know that I'm the son of King Leonidas or whatever he is.
[47:39.94]I think I'm going to go this way.
[47:49.17]This guy's dead within minutes of doing this.
[47:52.81]Within minutes.
[47:56.97]How many people do you think went on these quests back then?
[47:59.91]Oh, you need to go to the castle and find yourself.
[48:03.30]Get yourself a sword and a walking stick.
[48:07.31]They were dead within five seconds.
[48:15.52]The crow is almost mocking whatever is yelling.
[48:17.73]It's David.
[48:29.75]Oh shit.
[48:32.84]Oh no.
[48:33.96]We gotta pass through Skull Island.
[48:38.88]What has a skull that big?
[48:42.17]That's not supposed to be a dragon skull, right?
[48:44.13]I feel like that... Is it a giant skull?
[48:46.37]Imagine if it was supposed to be a dragon skull.
[48:47.95]That'd be kind of funny.
[48:52.22]Uh, I think I'm gonna... I'm checking that out first.
[49:05.78]Oh god.
[49:08.47]It's the Jedi Council.
[49:11.67]Am I supposed to be here?
[49:13.48]Who are these people?
[49:16.98]Um, hello?
[49:21.19]Do they not- they don't talk.
[49:34.66]Would nobody react to me doing this?
[49:39.74]What if I sit down on one of the chairs?
[49:51.12]I don't think these people are alive.
[49:52.38]Are they frozen?
[50:08.29]OK, these are not actual.
[50:09.69]I don't think they're alive.
[50:11.89]They're wax statues.
[50:15.95]What the hell?
[50:21.68]Press E. That's getting louder.
[50:34.93]Oh shit, that person is walking around.
[50:42.85]Hello?
[50:44.59]I am Chen Lai, Dragon Knight.
[50:48.35]Twelve knights will vote and you will become a Dragon Knight.
[50:53.70]Only if at least half our number decide in your favor.
[50:57.93]So I have to... Will you choose the path of power or that of wisdom?
[51:04.71]Of force or mercy?
[51:08.24]Or will you take the narrow road that divides the two?
[51:12.77]So it's wisdom or power.
[51:19.54]So what if I don't do either one?
[51:30.21]Will I get no votes?
[51:39.55]I'm not gonna get any votes if I, okay, should I do wisdom?
[51:43.93]Should I swing?
[51:55.05]Alright, I gotta save it again.
[51:57.25]So why weren't the other people on the council talking?
[52:00.65]Why were they like unplugged from the matrix?
[52:02.54]What were they doing?
[52:11.09]What was that?
[52:11.55]It was a cuckoo clock!
[52:28.88]Is this the castle?
[52:37.71]How do I open the door?
[52:44.53]Maybe I need the ring of the dragon.
[52:54.47]Mash it with the hammer?
[53:01.85]No.
[53:05.66]I don't know.
[53:11.11]Maybe I actually have to equip it.
[53:19.67]Can I hold the bone in my hand?
[53:22.59]Alright, I can't put the ring on.
[53:25.76]Alright, there we go.
[53:26.22]I got the hammer on now.
[53:38.21]Uh...
[53:48.79]I don't know.
[53:49.83]Whistle?
[53:51.54]Is this like a secret code or something?
[54:03.79]I don't know what to do.
[54:09.60]You can click your head in your inventory.
[54:11.68]Oh my goodness.
[54:12.91]Violence versus wisdom.
[54:18.46]Okay, so I have to choose a side.
[54:26.65]Alright, maybe I can't do this yet.
[54:33.48]Wait.
[54:36.13]Something right here.
[54:36.77]Is this a secret passage?
[54:42.56]Can I break it with this maybe?
[54:49.85]I don't know.
[54:53.97]Oh!
[54:54.17]Found it!
[55:04.21]What is this book?
[55:07.21]A spell book.
[55:10.12]Dude, wait a minute.
[55:12.86]Oh shit.
[55:16.15]I know I have spells now.
[55:18.56]What can I do?
[55:19.12]I don't know what these are.
[55:21.08]What is this one?
[55:22.67]This is... Oh, boy.
[55:26.71]Should I shoot it?
[55:29.60]How do I read the book?
[55:36.13]Yeah, I know it's a spell book, but how do I use it?
[55:45.97]Do I need the staff?
[55:52.38]I think it's just a walking stick.
[56:02.39]Well, I don't think I can do anything.
[56:04.63]Maybe he can teach me... That guy said he was wisdom, right?
[56:11.92]Maybe he can teach me a spell.
[56:17.11]You have been judged since the moment you awoke today.
[56:20.71]What?
[56:21.64]You should know that the balance so far is neither in favor of force or wisdom, but between the two.
[56:30.99]That is why my image sits in the seat of decision by the doorman.
[56:34.74]The way that I got the ball...
[56:37.21]If the scales should tip toward the side of force, my image will disappear.
[56:43.69]I haven't done anything yet, yeah.
[56:45.46]Alright, if I hit this guy with a sword and I talk to him, will he go, now you're violent?
[56:52.20]Okay, so I gotta do something else.
[56:55.61]I got the spell book.
[57:02.78]Was there a different way I could go?
[57:03.80]I'm invested in this now, I need to know.
[57:17.62]I need to find a wizard.
[57:24.67]Okay, so was there a place I could go to the right?
[57:35.71]I need to learn Fireball, you know what I mean?
[57:41.28]Have to.
[57:46.46]There's a path into one of the skulls.
[57:48.80]Oh, really?
[57:50.56]Thank you.
[57:57.17]I also feel like this is what you do when you open up like a music program.
[58:03.96]Anytime I've opened up GarageBand in my entire life or like some of those other music editing programs, you get that one track and you just kind of jam to it.
[58:15.01]You're like, what can I do with this?
[58:17.90]Like, what the fuck am I doing with this?
[58:20.90]You keep playing it on loop and you're like, alright, what drum beat am I adding to this?
[58:37.18]Okay, there was a path apparently.
[58:38.56]Oh!
[58:41.30]There was, wasn't there?
[58:42.28]Is it over here?
[58:47.72]Wait, no.
[58:50.50]It was up here, right?
[59:01.12]Oh, shit.
[59:03.53]Ah, look at that.
[59:04.27]Okay, let's go.
[59:05.93]Eh.
[59:10.26]I feel like I should have a weapon equipped.
[59:13.30]Not the spell book when I don't know any spells.
[59:17.21]I'm going hammer.
[59:17.91]I think blunt is better.
[59:37.19]Take a quick look around.
[59:45.72]This just got so fucked up.
[59:48.64]I got a key.
[60:00.72]Anything else?
[60:04.56]Doesn't look like it.
[60:08.81]Like a dungeon.
[60:15.92]Is that a stairwell?
[60:19.53]You could use the key on the door, maybe?
[60:22.67]You are cooking.
[60:33.52]Would you put a little toaster waffle in the corner with the text saying waffle cam?
[60:41.35]No, I'm not.
[60:42.51]We're not doing that.
[60:51.66]no no I'm not that's that that is one of those things where it's like oh there's a waffle cam and people come and be like why don't you have a waffle cam and it's like well because waffles of course xd oh no no maybe the key can be used here
[61:26.98]yeah alright we're in we did we to prove ourselves worthy I hear something going something moving something's moving something's moving something's moving something's moving what the hell was moving is there anything even in here
[61:59.45]There's nothing even in here.
[62:00.31]Oh wait.
[62:12.31]Oh shit, that is a skeleton warrior.
[62:23.06]Yeah.
[62:25.41]Back up back up.
[62:27.15]I don't know how to hold the shield up.
[62:34.97]How do you hold up the shield?
[62:48.58]I die in one hit?
[62:49.53]This must be endgame.
[63:16.27]I can go out here.
[63:18.41]This is the... Yeah, this is where I came in.
[63:22.13]Okay, should I try... I think I have to kill this thing.
[63:29.84]Equip the sword?
[63:32.13]How do I use the shield?
[63:40.38]Don't... I might get softlocked.
[63:46.54]I'm running in.
[63:49.72]There's nowhere else to run.
[63:50.86]I'm going to die right now.
[63:59.88]Maybe I can get up there and cheese it a little.
[64:12.87]That's some crazy reach on this.
[64:18.58]Don't do it.
[64:20.99]Die!
[64:21.50]No, he's getting too close.
[64:25.13]Back up.
[64:26.60]Where am I?
[64:27.32]Ah!
[64:47.95]Die!
[64:50.35]Die!
[64:54.32]Come on!
[64:57.50]Yes!
[64:59.00]Okay.
[65:00.48]So what, did he drop anything?
[65:05.85]Let me save it.
[65:15.16]Was there anything in the room that he was in?
[65:22.66]I don't think so.
[65:23.48]Well, there's a boulder here and he didn't have anything I could grab on him.
[65:51.72]This can't be over.
[65:52.74]I still have the key or is the key gone?
[65:56.57]OK, key is gone.
[65:57.69]But can I interact with this?
[66:08.42]There's a button on the wall.
[66:11.93]There is a button on the wall.
[66:16.92]Oh God.
[66:30.92]You're not gonna make that, man.
[66:34.52]That crushed him!
[66:41.25]Uh, I think there was a key on the bottom of that.
[66:42.98]There was.
[66:48.88]Alright, I got another key.
[66:52.01]What does happen to that key?
[66:55.95]Dude!
[66:57.48]It- I right clicked accidentally and it threw it somewhere.
[67:04.87]It's gone.
[67:22.30]Wrong save.
[67:34.87]Alright, give me the key.
[67:37.98]Was that... I did that with wisdom, right?
[67:50.38]So that was the other gate down here.
[67:51.65]So you probably could kill the skeleton with that, I'm imagining, right?
[68:04.93]Okay, trap door, let's go.
[68:06.63]Oh shit, we made it.
[68:15.36]I said, man, I wish this was my first game.
[68:28.58]A lot of the games that I played were kind of like this when I was younger.
[68:38.78]Should I knock?
[68:45.49]This definitely has the king's seal on it, right?
[68:58.81]Is it a monster?
[69:00.72]No!
[69:01.04]That's my family ring!
[69:03.44]Shit!
[69:05.97]There's a dragon.
[69:06.71]There's a dragon here.
[69:07.53]Do I have to fight it?
[69:10.67]Give me this back.
[69:17.22]I don't think I... I don't want to fight this thing.
[69:19.46]Is this a coffin?
[69:20.16]I think somebody's in there.
[69:25.75]Dude, that's a skeleton.
[69:32.38]I don't know what else to do.
[69:34.77]What the hell?
[69:38.18]I thought he was a giant cockroach.
[69:45.47]He's not a dragon, he's a big fucking centipede.
[69:49.54]Hmm?
[69:56.91]I have the ring.
[70:08.05]OK, well, he's friendly.
[70:13.80]Alright, so I need to use the ring, definitely.
[70:22.33]It's not the ring.
[70:36.45]Is it actually not the ring?
[70:38.61]That's crazy if it's not.
[70:46.94]It's not.
[70:48.97]What about this thing?
[70:50.27]Booze?
[70:54.41]Just... I hate that if you right click you throw shit.
[71:12.14]Okay.
[71:12.80]I don't have anything else to put in there.
[71:14.54]He said an entire riddle and all he goes is, I have the ring.
[71:22.56]I have the ring.
[71:23.70]What other item do I... Yeah, he says you put the twin in there.
[71:26.36]It's a gem.
[71:33.05]I need another... I need a gemstone.
[71:38.34]Alright, so I need to find another ruby.
[71:42.97]Alright.
[71:58.12]Well, not just in here, right?
[72:16.15]The Ruby's twin is in Castle Von Wallenrod.
[72:23.00]The dragon ring you wear is not unknown to me.
[72:28.61]If you have the right to wear it, then you should harness its power.
[72:35.70]That ring will channel the magic power that flows in your veins.
[72:42.01]But only if it is yours by
[72:47.97]Okay.
[72:51.78]So I have to go to the castle.
[73:07.82]We have to go get burnt, I think.
[73:09.44]And what's this?
[73:10.68]An open door spell.
[73:15.01]How do I read it?
[73:16.33]Do I have to hold it in my hand?
[73:19.37]You taught me the world's dumbest spell, dude.
[73:23.16]I'm sorry.
[73:25.22]You must harness the power of the dragon ring.
[73:29.38]Please take this spell.
[73:31.44]Oh, it could be fire.
[73:32.63]It could be ice.
[73:33.65]It could be telepathy.
[73:36.61]That's how you open a door.
[73:38.65]No, where's my fire?
[73:47.85]Do I know it though?
[73:48.85]How do I even use it?
[73:49.69]I can't read that thing.
[74:09.94]You combine it with the book.
[74:11.20]I hope that worked.
[74:17.80]Oh, hell yeah.
[74:18.94]Alright, it's... That's how you open doors.
[74:24.35]Hey, I know where to take this.
[74:26.21]Let's go.
[74:26.97]I have to go back to that, like, underground, uh, back... I know where to go.
[74:38.45]How do I get the hell out of here?
[74:42.05]Oh, I know.
[74:43.60]Um, open door.
[74:50.35]It's double circle bug mathematics.
[75:05.71]Double circle bug mathematics.
[75:15.63]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[75:19.22]Get out of here.
[75:36.99]You have to cast it on a door.
[75:38.01]Well, this is where I came in.
[75:40.77]Isn't this where I walked in?
[75:49.31]You fell in.
[75:55.66]How do I get the hell out of here?
[75:59.70]How do I get out of here?
[76:01.26]Help.
[76:02.98]You fell off.
[76:05.83]Good.
[76:09.91]Oh, wait, hold on.
[76:10.55]Can I go that way?
[76:14.47]Behind this?
[76:18.18]No.
[76:21.95]Use it on the coffin.
[76:28.82]Dude, I need a ruby for that.
[76:32.76]Go back where you came in.
[76:34.60]That's where I just was though, isn't it?
[76:35.63]Are you fucking serious, dude?
[76:43.80]I'm casting spells at brick walls and I had to jump.
[77:05.91]Okay.
[77:07.43]I now have the ability to open the door at the end here.
[77:10.45]Wait, did I get wisdom for this?
[77:13.28]I want to see my wisdom meter.
[77:16.98]Why do I have violence?
[77:17.94]I just learned how to open doors with my mind.
[77:21.19]Shouldn't be violence.
[77:34.13]Oh, wait.
[77:34.53]This guy's going to be mad, right?
[77:37.09]You have been judged since the moment you awoke today.
[77:41.64]You should know that the balance so far is neither in favor of force or wisdom, but between the two.
[77:50.08]Okay, fine.
[77:50.99]That is why my image sits in the seat of decision by the Dolmans.
[77:56.11]But if the scales should tip toward the side of force, my image will disappear and my vote will be lost to you.
[78:06.40]Well, I'm going to be using a lot of spells.
[78:09.81]But don't worry.
[78:26.27]Go time.
[78:28.27]Open.
[78:35.90]Oh, here we go.
[78:39.11]The spelt didn't even open the door all the way.
[78:43.99]Look at how weak that was.
[78:45.87]I have to sneak under the door.
[78:50.70]Alright, where are we?
[78:55.96]I can go this way.
[78:57.97]Why would I be able to go over here, though?
[79:06.65]I'm gonna get lost over here, I know it.
[79:23.14]Jeez.
[79:24.73]That was fast?
[79:30.45]What does this say?
[79:31.13]Is this an inn?
[79:34.62]Whoa!
[79:36.52]What is this freaking me out?
[79:49.56]What is this?
[79:51.24]Am I for dinner?
[79:57.95]Welcome traveler
[80:02.15]The lad's young, Albert.
[80:04.35]He doesn't get tired.
[80:06.68]Not like you and me, huh, George?
[80:10.34]How would you get tired, Albert?
[80:13.75]I was thinking of you, George.
[80:16.89]Not so fast.
[80:18.96]There's a little matter of a toad.
[80:22.72]You mean rats, Albert.
[80:25.50]Exactly, George.
[80:27.33]Rats.
[80:28.09]So we earn a few crumbs by charging a toll.
[80:32.73]You pay us the toll.
[80:35.13]That means money.
[80:37.62]Thank you, George.
[80:40.48]You pay us a few coins, young man, and you can be on your way.
[80:47.05]No money.
[80:50.63]I'm gonna warn you.
[80:53.40]I can't open any door in your fucking little dump.
[81:05.21]What if I just started swinging at these guys?
[81:16.32]Probably not at the ogre.
[81:18.93]dragons.
[81:20.59]You know what they are, don't you?
[81:23.60]Plenty of them around these parts.
[81:26.16]Now, to make the nectar, we take the resin from the hive of the dragonfly.
[81:34.27]You pass it on your way here.
[81:38.07]It could just be a tape in BioShock.
[81:43.28]The resin is dangerous.
[81:45.68]Make sure you don't touch it.
[81:48.41]Just scoop it up with this ladle.
[81:52.46]You can go there straight away.
[81:55.20]The dragonfly must have just made today's resin.
[81:59.23]Okay, so I use my scooper to pick... It's so dangerous.
[82:05.26]It's so toxic and corrosive and vile.
[82:10.61]But you can use a soup ladle to pick it up.
[82:20.69]Can I eat whatever's in here?
[82:25.60]Give me a taste of this.
[82:32.61]Okay, we'll use the soup.
[82:33.89]Wait, there gotta be other items in here, right?
[82:45.74]That's a big spiderweb.
[82:51.58]do do do do do do do do do do do do that was awful okay I can't I probably could cast a fire wait what about the open door
[83:21.60]Uh-oh, hello.
[83:23.76]Evil?
[83:25.98]I think that thing's evil.
[83:31.99]I just want the soup.
[83:32.99]I want the soup.
[83:37.50]No, give me the soup.
[83:38.28]I need the ladle.
[83:41.24]Get away from me.
[83:49.07]Get out of here.
[84:02.60]I don't even want to fight this thing.
[84:05.49]But I will.
[84:30.20]Get out of here!
[84:33.15]Violence user?
[84:33.99]What am I supposed to do?
[84:34.77]Talk to him?
[84:46.90]I couldn't talk to him.
[84:48.28]I was trying to.
[84:58.08]Okay, I got wisdom from doing that, by the way.
[85:01.66]Run past it?
[85:02.45]I tried that too!
[85:06.21]Did you not see me running around clicking on every one of these as fast as I could?
[85:20.85]Okay, that was dumb.
[85:21.97]Because I did that same thing like ten times.
[85:27.90]Alright, I got your goo, whatever the hell it is.
[85:34.66]There.
[85:43.91]Welcome, traveler.
[85:45.97]Easy now, George.
[85:48.67]This is our young friend, remember?
[85:51.77]He's got our ladle.
[85:54.14]Full of resin, I see.
[85:57.42]Good work, young fellow.
[85:59.82]Thank you.
[86:01.04]Thank you.
[86:02.89]While you were at the hive, George and I got to feeling guilty as dogs.
[86:10.27]Rats, Albert.
[86:11.96]Rats?
[86:13.24]Oh, alright, George.
[86:16.58]Guilty because we sent you on a dangerous job.
[86:21.91]So we decided to give you a present.
[86:26.87]Is this a ratatouille?
[86:28.73]Oh.
[86:30.43]Um, yeah.
[86:32.65]A new page.
[86:36.58]Oh, sick.
[86:40.87]What is it?
[86:45.17]That's what I'm talking about.
[86:46.14]That is exactly what I wanted.
[86:53.03]Time.
[86:56.35]Thing math.
[86:59.07]Time 8 math.
[87:04.34]Kind of flail.
[87:06.97]Cool.
[87:09.07]And some rope.
[87:10.68]Look at this thing.
[87:11.78]Let's test it on him.
[87:38.28]What?
[87:39.11]He wasn't even near me!
[87:43.33]He was behind the bar!
[87:44.56]How did I die from nothing?
[88:06.48]Okay, he's strong.
[88:12.39]Oh, thank God.
[88:27.22]Oh, thank God.
[88:30.83]We're good.
[88:32.51]That just actually gave me a heart attack because day 0.2 was like 30 or 40 minutes ago.
[88:39.60]Okay, where am I going?
[88:41.02]Oh, also... Um... The... My game just crashed.
[88:52.01]Okay, well... I hope I didn't fuck it up.
[88:56.66]It looked like it was having some trouble.
[88:59.77]I'm not gonna lie, it was having trouble.
[89:08.66]It really did not like that I saved it there.
[89:16.60]Hope it doesn't do that again.
[89:24.13]Okay.
[89:27.19]we're good alright so I'm gonna I definitely use fireball here uh when I get to another stopping point I'm gonna take a quick break and I'm gonna remind everybody about one thing I have it right here save it right here as well I'm gonna do a new slot to not have like a corrupted save slot
[89:56.35]Hell yeah.
[90:01.78]Okay, new zone.
[90:05.04]That looks like a bat.
[90:06.12]That looks like a scary guy.
[90:09.83]Okay, we're not going to go any further.
[90:12.53]I'm going to take a quick break.
[90:13.43]I'm going to pee and get another drink.
[90:19.12]Before I forget...
[90:21.07]There is an hour and 20 minutes left on the Doug Doug charity auction for the Dreamcast microphone.
[90:32.18]If you don't know what I'm talking about, this is the last time I'll be able to speak on it.
[90:37.80]Doug Doug's doing a charity event for the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
[90:42.88]And he's doing some creator auction stuff.
[90:46.35]Streamers and YouTubers and he's got a bunch of cool stuff.
[90:50.41]I have an item in this.
[90:52.24]It is the Dreamcast microphone that I used for Seaman.
[90:57.14]It's the one that I used on stream for Seaman for the Dreamcast.
[91:02.13]I signed it.
[91:03.63]It's there.
[91:04.03]A lot of money has been put on this so far.
[91:08.26]It's at $2,500 right now, which is crazy.
[91:13.35]There's only an hour or so, an hour and some change left on the auction before it's closed, and then whoever gets it, gets it.
[91:24.15]Was that the one that you put in your butt?
[91:26.48]I'm not saying that because I don't want somebody to hear that and go, wait a minute, I need to buy that.
[91:32.37]This did not go, that did not happen because you're adding potential reasons for people to either not want this or to want it bad.
[91:42.44]Okay?
[91:42.84]There's two ways to go there.
[91:44.35]There's, I don't fucking want that.
[91:45.79]That's horrendous.
[91:47.19]And then there's, bro, really?
[91:48.83]How much is it now?
[91:53.55]So no, I'm not adding or taking away value from this at all.
[91:56.41]I'm just telling you what it is.
[92:01.18]Have you cleaned?
[92:03.54]Yes.
[92:05.18]This thing has been cleaned many times.
[92:06.78]I've used it to clean.
[92:07.86]I clean my peripherals.
[92:08.98]I use cleaning fluids and I take care of my stuff, especially controllers, especially old controllers.
[92:17.19]So anyways, I'll be right back.
[92:19.11]There's only an hour left if you really, really want it or if you want it and it's going to charity.
[92:22.87]So
[92:24.50]It's going to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
[92:32.01]What's the image they used for the auction?
[92:35.19]I think there's a Susky image in there.
[92:37.45]I didn't make the listing.
[92:39.28]It's just there.
[92:39.76]Alright.
[92:42.88]Be right back.
[92:43.86]Goodbye.
[99:02.23]I have returned.
[99:04.15]And I have a hard pretzel and I'm going to make a lot of people in the VOD very upset with me.
[99:08.02]I usually hear about it later.
[99:09.04]I hear about, oh man, he's crunching that pretzel and it fucking enrages me.
[99:21.38]I'll mute for one more second.
[99:46.22]Somebody said you should crunch proudly.
[99:56.09]The thing about hard pretzels, I like any pretzel, right?
[100:00.54]But if you eat a very hard, dense, crusty pretzel, it's a two-handed job.
[100:08.35]One hand has to make sure that all the dust, all the sawdust comes out, that it doesn't go all over you.
[100:14.17]Because when you bite into a hard pretzel like this, it is like you're making a birdhouse.
[100:21.38]So much pretzel sawdust comes out.
[100:25.18]And you have to tip your head all the way back and bite it so all the sawdust goes into your mouth.
[100:30.61]It's rough.
[100:32.19]You have to do two hands.
[100:39.97]And you get a really hard piece.
[100:45.23]We're talking about sawdust.
[100:47.60]I'm not explaining it.
[100:58.81]Dude, if I had my noise gate off, this would be crazy.
[101:03.51]Crazy.
[101:04.01]It would be unbelievable.
[101:05.93]I'm going to turn my noise gate off for one second.
[101:07.71]You ready?
[101:09.36]This is a fair warning.
[101:10.22]My nose gate is going off just to prove a point.
[101:13.73]So here it comes.
[101:14.19]If you don't want to hear this, skip 10 seconds.
[101:16.71]Ready?
[101:27.03]This is what reality sounds like, okay?
[101:29.03]This is what real people sound like.
[101:35.58]Okay.
[101:51.20]It's got a filter.
[101:52.34]It's got a compressor.
[101:54.20]That's what real people sound like.
[102:07.80]Yes, you're real.
[102:13.31]You're real.
[102:17.35]You fucked me up.
[102:19.87]This is your fault.
[102:21.38]This is your fault for doing this to me.
[102:24.90]I just sucked in pretzel dust.
[102:27.56]And it changed my voice.
[102:30.97]Time that person up for fucking 10 minutes.
[102:32.37]I'm not even kidding.
[102:43.79]Okay.
[102:51.44]Now it's all over me.
[102:53.50]This is that person's fault.
[102:54.88]Three people said it, and they all need to go to the dungeon.
[103:06.96]Alright, this one's for the OGs, alright?
[103:19.82]Alright, we're ready.
[103:35.10]Chill out, man.
[103:37.26]You know what's crazy is I just like took a couple of sips out of my water bottle.
[103:42.84]And that's like, hey, dude, whoa, settle down.
[103:46.59]You need to relax.
[103:49.34]Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[103:52.14]Hit the brakes a little, man.
[104:07.52]Alright, we're good.
[104:07.94]Can I go up with this person?
[104:14.56]This is the guy in the beginning of the opening cutscene that killed my fucking dad or whatever it was, right?
[104:19.03]My, like, king father?
[104:20.27]Did they even kill my father?
[104:26.36]Was it implied that they even... I don't... Maybe they just captured him.
[104:28.82]I don't know.
[104:37.25]He may have just been captured.
[104:38.25]I don't know if they slayed the king.
[104:42.71]Uh, I'm just gonna walk up to him.
[104:49.33]That's not a good start.
[104:52.89]Yeah.
[105:11.33]Okay, you just turned into like a weirder looking version of yourself.
[105:16.40]That's not scary.
[105:17.28]You look like a Jim Henson creation.
[105:24.10]I mean, should I start throwing fireballs at you?
[105:31.13]I think this guy's been looking for any excuse to do that.
[105:38.38]He's scratching his ass!
[105:39.94]I caught him scratching his ass!
[105:53.27]Oh, thank you.
[106:06.71]That feels better.
[106:09.60]Uh...
[106:23.56]What the fuck?
[106:31.13]It can't hit me, hold on.
[106:32.61]Fire fire fire fire fireball.
[106:34.79]Fireball!
[106:36.64]Do it!
[106:37.18]Hurry!
[106:42.00]Oh, he doesn't like it.
[106:53.26]He's getting too close.
[106:55.68]Oh, I think he got me.
[106:56.82]My window just got bigger.
[107:02.21]Click it!
[107:04.02]You can fuck with my windows.
[107:11.41]Come on!
[107:13.49]Do it!
[107:17.06]I can't click it anymore.
[107:18.00]Am I out of mana?
[107:23.28]Oh shit, I'm out of mana.
[107:24.90]Wait, I can just sit here and it'll regen.
[107:43.17]This is cheating.
[107:58.31]You're cheesing a 30 year old game.
[108:00.03]That's the way you should be doing this.
[108:02.24]These games are notoriously impossible or bizarre or need a very specific one random.
[108:07.64]Of course I'm going to do that.
[108:10.69]I'm even considering saving it right here.
[108:22.55]OK, I think I'm good.
[108:24.55]And let's go.
[108:37.19]Is this like the last boss?
[108:39.95]What if this is the guy?
[108:40.88]Can I just win right here?
[108:42.92]He seems to have a problem with hitting me.
[108:50.97]He's like bumping into me.
[108:54.93]He keeps raising his hand to swing and then it doesn't happen.
[109:00.58]Oh my god, I can't click this last fucking thing.
[109:06.45]Do it!
[109:08.29]I can't click it.
[109:09.54]Finally!
[109:13.28]He's getting so close!
[109:16.37]He's right in my face!
[109:22.08]I'm just hitting him, whatever.
[109:23.18]Oh, I stabbed him right in the stomach!
[109:38.38]Why is this going at like one frame a second right now?
[109:52.80]He's gotta be close, right?
[110:00.24]I'm overloading the 5080?
[110:12.75]He's going down, eventually.
[110:16.84]Oh, I got the flail!
[110:17.78]That thing's gonna be awesome, you're right.
[110:19.75]Is he dead?
[110:26.70]Dead.
[110:34.25]Okay, what did... So, what?
[110:48.02]I thought this guy in the dark.
[110:59.90]I said, you killed that guy for no reason.
[111:04.29]He turned into a monster in front of me and then said, I'm gonna get you.
[111:09.40]And then the music started playing.
[111:10.62]Ouch!
[111:13.46]Ouch!
[111:16.13]Ouch!
[111:16.97]Ouch!
[111:18.03]Ouch!
[111:18.91]Ouch!
[111:19.97]Ouch!
[111:20.67]Ouch!
[111:24.26]And I just bopped him in the fucking head a few times.
[111:44.74]Now I'm angry.
[111:46.42]Check your inventory near their body for loot.
[111:54.41]What?
[111:58.82]Are you serious?
[112:01.12]Have I missed out on loot this whole time?
[112:02.82]I don't think he had anything.
[112:20.24]I don't think I have any... Maybe the whistle?
[112:26.41]Does the whistle make sense?
[112:35.47]There is loot on this guy based on the video.
[112:38.61]What?
[112:40.61]The fuck?
[112:43.22]There's loot on this guy?
[112:55.06]Where is it?
[113:12.12]Did I kill him in such a stupid place that I can't even do it?
[113:16.52]Like his body?
[113:20.49]Oh my goodness.
[113:25.25]What is that?
[113:26.05]A shovel?
[113:28.85]That means the other skeletons had loot on them too.
[113:42.03]Should I go back to loot the skeleton?
[113:47.62]What if there's an item on one of them that I really actually need?
[113:52.25]I'm serious.
[113:54.49]The things I've killed so far, I need to go see if they had anything.
[114:05.62]Nothing.
[114:06.17]Okay, that's fine.
[114:09.95]Wait, what about this skeleton?
[114:16.34]Nope.
[114:22.08]What about the skeleton that was in the cave?
[114:24.40]And that's all I'm going to do.
[114:36.02]Now I feel like I'm playing Myst.
[114:41.50]Yeah.
[114:42.30]Just run all the way to the very beginning of the game and put the one piece of paper you found into the toilet or whatever you have to do.
[114:54.63]Honestly, if you locked me in a room and did not give me a guide, and said I had to beat Mist in one sitting, I think I would go crazy.
[115:13.10]I don't think I'd be able to do it.
[115:18.31]Okay, did you have an important piece of loot on you?
[115:23.79]Yeah, he did.
[115:25.56]A gigantic two-handed cleaver axe.
[115:37.80]Which you bet your ass I'm gonna use.
[115:43.55]Wait, I can still use my shield?
[115:54.69]Let's go back to where I was.
[116:10.89]I think I'm most of the castle.
[116:14.04]I'm probably like 40 minutes away from beating the whole game.
[116:21.08]I just killed the antagonist's main lieutenant.
[116:44.08]Alright, let's go.
[116:55.33]Save it right here.
[116:55.96]And that's an ore, people were saying.
[117:05.46]It's... a barge pole!
[117:09.71]Wow!
[117:19.32]Huh?
[117:31.85]So what?
[117:33.03]Don't throw it, please!
[117:36.38]No!
[117:37.32]No, I left the fucking rope!
[117:41.56]I gotta go back and get the rope!
[117:50.08]This game is so dumb.
[117:57.09]Oh wait, there's another magician.
[117:59.84]I'm sorry, I need to reload it.
[118:12.21]I'm not speaking to you until you have enough mystical power for me to care.
[118:15.75]I'll talk to somebody that wants violence instead.
[118:26.80]Alright, who are you and what do you want?
[118:32.63]Never mind, uh, bye.
[118:37.37]Whoa, what is that?
[118:45.57]Don't go back.
[118:47.75]Talk to the wizard.
[118:50.93]I am former thane of Havshal.
[118:55.32]We shall meet again when the voting begins.
[119:00.28]You have come far.
[119:02.43]Okay, if I kill all of these guys, can I just stand up and cast a vote for myself?
[119:06.65]You have your mother's courage.
[119:08.69]Does that work?
[119:09.77]The balance of your actions hangs between...
[119:17.43]Unless the scales tip toward violence, you may count on my support.
[119:24.68]Alright, there's a second wisdom guy.
[119:29.00]We've yet to find anybody that supports force or violence.
[119:33.95]So these two have been... And how many people... Is it five people, six people?
[119:39.98]What's the how many people actually have to vote?
[119:46.57]That thing looks scary.
[119:53.51]What the hell is this thing?
[119:56.79]I probably shouldn't touch this, but I'm going to.
[119:59.02]Okay.
[120:11.50]Just stand still for a minute or two until I figure this out.
[120:30.45]Eat shit.
[120:41.89]I shot the fireball at myself.
[120:51.00]Okay, so that's not what you do.
[121:00.55]I have to bring an item of some kind here.
[121:04.09]Okay.
[121:06.72]Um, should I feed it something?
[121:08.62]Is it hungry?
[121:09.36]He just, like, took my head off.
[121:20.09]I don't think he liked that.
[121:21.76]He was like, eh!
[121:27.85]How much was this game?
[121:28.84]I don't know.
[121:30.20]I think it was like $3.
[121:33.86]Don't worry.
[121:34.34]I would have paid $50.
[121:45.25]What should I do?
[121:46.25]Maybe the whistle.
[121:48.31]Maybe it reacts to sound.
[121:55.42]It didn't kill me.
[122:00.93]What about the rope?
[122:13.04]If he hits me once, I'm dead.
[122:28.76]Josh said there's a skull I can pick up.
[122:32.11]Pick up the skull on the ground on the right side of the vine.
[122:48.22]I never would have ever done that.
[122:52.37]Ever.
[122:54.57]Do I just feed it to him?
[123:01.07]Okay, he has magical spells.
[123:03.31]What do I do with this?
[123:14.02]Maybe I bring this somewhere else?
[123:25.02]Use wisdom.
[123:25.92]I don't have any.
[123:31.28]I'm buying this with the rope?
[123:36.46]What would this do?
[123:40.41]What the fuck?
[124:01.28]Okay, I've got my rope with the skull on it.
[124:04.97]Now I take... Maybe I just don't fight him at all.
[124:10.29]Use it on the branch.
[124:13.84]Here we go.
[124:21.51]Sorry about that, I just... It was on my skull toboggan.
[124:28.41]Who are you?
[124:29.68]So you got past my wall.
[124:33.33]I am a Tenatia, dragon knight.
[124:39.48]And you are wearing the dragon ring of the Van Wallenrods.
[124:45.01]Who are you?
[124:46.45]Getting into the castle won't be easy.
[124:49.27]This is like a loading sound.
[124:50.53]And she has this look on her face.
[124:54.64]You'll become a knight only...
[124:57.17]If at least half the dragon rings are for you.
[125:01.88]There are 12 dragon knights living.
[125:04.80]Oh man, that's too many.
[125:06.24]There's also Fujitomo.
[125:09.29]He's dead.
[125:10.75]But his dragon ring has not yet been claimed.
[125:16.02]If you get it, that will be a vote for you.
[125:19.40]As for my vote, you'll have to earn it.
[125:25.05]I like men whose souls are made of steel and whose blades are red with blood you like violence okay because that's all I'm capable of doing I can't do any wisdom you know alright now get out of the way we made it to the mushroom kingdom
[125:57.67]So there are 12 dragon lords...
[126:10.22]Talk to me for a second, please.
[126:12.87]A pity you're too big to visit the people in the toadstools.
[126:18.69]They welcome friendly visitors their own size.
[126:23.08]Yes, Werner.
[126:25.14]I know who you are and where you're going.
[126:29.66]I am Chelhidra, and I wear a dragon ring.
[126:36.28]Prove yourself to be wise, and you will have my vote.
[126:41.62]Unlike Tanathia, the sight of blood gives me no pleasure.
[126:48.41]If she votes for you, you may be sure I'll vote against.
[126:53.26]The sprites who live in those toadstools are friends of mine.
[126:58.18]If you decide to pay them a visit, I'll be watching.
[127:08.56]Well, I'm gonna pay them a visit.
[127:16.68]How do I go in?
[127:21.33]Oh, I can't.
[127:23.93]Okay, so I can't go in there.
[127:43.51]I can fill up my flask, I think, here.
[127:52.36]Really?
[127:52.62]I would have guaranteed I could have done that.
[128:01.97]Maybe this thing?
[128:09.38]What?
[128:11.72]No way.
[128:15.25]I have two containers to hold liquid.
[128:18.21]And none of these can hold liquid.
[128:25.24]I'll check back later.
[128:34.47]New area.
[128:34.95]I love the sound effects here.
[128:58.20]this sound actually hurts I didn't even say hello to this person oh shit
[129:17.81]You're Werner, aren't you?
[129:19.87]There is something I want you to do for me.
[129:24.14]Take this cog.
[129:26.94]You'll soon find something to put it in.
[129:30.88]Just put the cog back in its place and don't listen to what my sister tells you.
[129:37.11]Put the cog back in its place.
[129:48.27]You got it.
[129:55.52]This person's a weirdo.
[130:04.07]You couldn't have a more annoying house.
[130:06.20]It's so annoying sounding.
[130:16.11]Anything else I can grab here before I get out of this fucking horrible place?
[130:25.98]Ugh!
[130:31.61]Alright, well I got a cog.
[130:35.99]Alright, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out, I'm out.
[130:40.68]I'm just gonna jump over the edge.
[130:45.79]Get me out of here.
[130:51.40]Get me out of here!
[130:52.26]How do I get out of here?
[130:56.65]Get me out!
[130:57.31]There's only two steps on this ladder.
[131:06.56]Why was that ten?
[131:17.59]I just went all the way up.
[131:23.01]It's okay.
[131:23.45]I can tank it for another 10 seconds.
[131:25.34]Is there going to be another item to get?
[131:34.37]Yep.
[131:35.81]Oh, I don't know.
[131:36.29]It's like bubble wrap, whatever it is.
[131:38.17]What is this?
[131:40.57]Piece of cloth.
[131:41.84]You got it.
[131:51.15]Anything to do with the bed or anything?
[131:52.51]Yup.
[131:55.68]What is on the bed?
[132:01.85]Something under the pillow.
[132:04.75]She's got money under there.
[132:07.32]Really?
[132:07.62]Nothing?
[132:12.04]Alright, get me out now.
[132:15.63]I couldn't live in this house.
[132:21.69]go back down the stairs hurry hurry keep going keep going keep going keep going keep going keep going keep going keep going keep going keep going get out just leave you have the wheel
[132:54.38]How do I get out of here?
[132:59.13]Your house doesn't have a door to leave!
[133:09.20]You actually have to go out the window?
[133:26.90]I tried it.
[133:27.66]I tried it.
[133:29.54]Oh, fuck, the game's breaking.
[133:30.48]The game's breaking.
[133:31.55]The game's breaking.
[133:33.95]The game's breaking!
[133:34.77]And I haven't saved it.
[133:45.91]Up, like, out here?
[133:46.87]Dude, what kind of house is this?
[133:55.30]There's no exit.
[134:04.07]Climb up onto the roof.
[134:07.46]Downstairs?
[134:08.40]Is there a downstairs here?
[134:09.78]Get away from me.
[134:24.22]Oh my god.
[134:25.62]I'm never going in here ever again.
[134:38.85]Maybe use it here?
[134:39.64]What did I need to use this on?
[134:49.42]I got cloth as well.
[134:52.28]Maybe start trying to combine stuff?
[135:14.32]How come people are screaming?
[135:15.39]I don't know.
[135:15.67]It's medieval times.
[135:27.34]I've been here before.
[135:28.54]Was there another way to go?
[135:33.57]There is.
[135:34.75]Okay.
[135:36.57]What up there?
[135:48.61]So tranquil Excuse me, I just like sniffed one of the flowers I Carried you away from the flowers
[136:13.67]Otherwise, we'd never again counter Von Wallenrod amongst our knights.
[136:18.64]Okay, thank you.
[136:21.21]I'm going and doing it again.
[136:22.49]But who are you?
[136:23.47]Tell me about yourself.
[136:24.31]I am Artus of Erwindil.
[136:28.10]long ago my family chose the way of order chaos and violence will never gain my vote do any of you do that flowers you must find a way to avoid breathing in their perfume everybody is against the violence except for one person and do not harm the others your father axel was a fine man
[136:54.07]It will be no easy task to inherit his title.
[136:57.88]Diakonov will vote against you.
[137:00.64]His family has always been the enemy of the von Wallenrads.
[137:05.01]Only the Pact of Peace prevented your father and Hagen von Diakonov from spilling each other's blood.
[137:14.81]I thought he said Hagen does for a second.
[137:20.11]Alright, so I gotta go pick a couple of flowers, but not all of them.
[137:28.80]I didn't, I clicked once.
[137:32.95]Shit, wrong way.
[137:39.65]Maybe use the cloth as a mask against the flowers?
[137:42.32]Not a bad idea.
[137:48.53]I'd love to go the right way.
[137:49.81]That'd be nice.
[137:59.06]Ow.
[137:59.39]I just had a headache from that.
[138:00.33]I laugh because somebody did a cat jam to that song.
[138:07.72]Alright.
[138:08.46]Save it right here.
[138:15.82]So I have to pick flowers without touching them.
[138:22.77]Maybe I should use a glove?
[138:29.22]Okay, here's one there.
[138:36.09]I don't have to do it yet.
[138:37.29]I could just walk this way.
[138:38.29]Hello?
[138:46.39]Werner von Wallenrod, I am Kuru, one of the twelve living dragon knights.
[138:59.89]My image sits in the dolmen seat.
[139:03.29]For the present, you have my support.
[139:07.10]You walk the narrow path between power and pity.
[139:11.62]That is no easy road, von Wallenrod.
[139:14.84]Do not wander down the road of mercy, or you will lose my vote.
[139:21.99]Okay, so if I continue to be a centrist, I get his vote?
[139:27.42]No one else's.
[139:30.48]He looks like a Lego?
[139:32.34]He's a Lego guy?
[139:33.48]My image.
[139:39.29]His outfit is kind of crazy.
[139:40.89]Alright, this is a cog right here.
[139:56.74]um what is he doing what is he doing is he okay my image sits in the dolmen that looked like he was attacking me well whatever
[140:28.30]You gotta be kidding me, right?
[140:29.78]How is this not... What are you... Stop!
[140:51.67]Leave me alone!
[140:52.35]What is he doing?
[140:54.39]This looks angry.
[141:00.30]Yeah, he's clearly saying, hi-ya.
[141:02.80]Like, hi-ya, I'm hitting you.
[141:07.97]Uh, rope, maybe?
[141:21.89]Anything in the band?
[141:34.48]Get away from me!
[141:37.49]I think I need a crank.
[141:45.24]Yeah, I need some kind of crank.
[141:58.10]Can I use the bone?
[142:05.43]Can I use the stick, maybe?
[142:13.18]You probably need a crank.
[142:17.47]I look like I can pull that, but I can't seem to touch it.
[142:26.56]Maybe I should be right in front of it?
[142:33.19]Okay, it wants me to touch that, but I can't.
[142:38.12]I don't think I can do it.
[142:59.40]This guy is fucking up my pathing.
[143:05.17]Alright, so how do I pick these up without causing a problem?
[143:08.75]Save it here.
[143:13.84]Maybe cloth?
[143:20.33]Oh, come on, dude.
[143:24.72]This guy's gonna get sick and tired of doing this.
[143:36.29]This is becoming a habit.
[143:40.23]To pick flowers, you must avoid breathing their perfume.
[143:46.18]A damp cloth, perhaps.
[143:49.51]Would you look at that?
[143:51.17]That would be smart, wouldn't it?
[143:58.94]Wow.
[144:00.88]A damp cloth.
[144:07.15]Thanks for the tip.
[144:15.44]Fuck you!
[144:21.23]Oh, you dropped a wet napkin on the ground!

[144:25.32]Oh fuck, I killed him!
[144:30.16]Oh shit, look at this guy's weapon!
[144:32.21]He's got like the fucking Master Sword!
[144:36.77]I think I'm keeping... Is that alright?
[144:39.57]No.
[144:42.03]Okay, hold on.
[144:44.50]If I breathe in those flowers again, what happens?
[144:48.80]I want to see what this is.
[144:49.64]A dagger?
[144:54.95]That's it?
[144:56.59]I thought it was like a magical sword.
[144:58.17]This guy sucks.
[145:01.47]What a fucking wimp.
[145:16.41]That's so dumb.
[145:20.21]It's a wet napkin.
[145:21.57]Okay, imagine somebody dropped a wet napkin in front of you.
[145:25.92]Somebody that just told you to go wet a napkin.
[145:29.13]Oh, whoops, I dropped it.
[145:30.79]Oh, that's a threat.
[145:34.19]He deserved it.
[145:35.21]I'm sorry.
[145:36.58]He came after me for me dropping a napkin on the ground.
[145:38.96]That's fucked up.
[145:42.63]He stabbed me twice because of a wet paper towel.
[145:51.58]What if it was a huge disrespect, cultural disrespect?
[145:55.75]He told me to wet a napkin and then use it.
[145:59.71]I don't know.
[146:00.28]He's dead.
[146:02.06]It's over.
[146:03.80]Like, I'm not save scumming that.
[146:06.27]That guy was a fucking weirdo.
[146:27.27]Nice.
[146:32.73]That gets me in too much trouble, guys.
[146:35.90]How many can I take?
[146:45.25]He said only take a few.
[146:46.81]Well, that guy's gone.

[147:35.59]I can't get there's no more red second grab.
[147:39.52]That's all I can take.
[147:41.76]OK.
[147:45.63]Now what do I do with this?
[147:47.35]Can I smell it?
[147:57.00]Can I mush them together and make like a medicine?
[148:06.46]Okay, well I don't know where to go.
[148:30.07]Did anybody want flowers?

[149:36.61]I think I picked them all up.
[149:43.44]It's all good.
[149:44.04]Alright, well, whatever.
[149:59.03]My image already sits in the Dolman's seat.
[150:03.02]The balance swings toward the side of force.
[150:07.06]Truly, your soul is made of steel.
[150:13.21]Wait, what?
[150:18.83]I killed, okay.
[150:20.44]Well.
[150:25.97]It is what it is.
[150:36.10]Somebody definitely wanted flowers and I don't remember who it was.
[150:41.30]Does anybody remember?
[150:41.98]Anyone have any idea where these flowers go?
[150:46.51]Or should we consult the guide?
[150:56.02]The blonde lady?
[150:58.50]There's one more path on the fountain area?
[151:00.17]Okay, hold on.
[151:16.57]He lives in a treehouse?
[151:17.53]Is that a friend or foe?
[151:42.69]Um...
[151:46.95]okay so go up into the treehouse oh my god I can't go anywhere dude there's an apple
[152:20.76]I can't go over there.
[152:26.78]Yeah, that's it.
[152:29.79]I can feed the dog the apple.
[152:48.37]Oh, alright.
[152:49.39]What are you doing?
[152:53.16]Are you good?
[152:53.70]Should I give him another one?
[153:02.07]Wait, is he just gonna follow me now?
[153:14.39]Is he my friend?
[153:19.88]I can't go in the treehouse.
[153:28.27]I can't with all these sound effects.
[153:41.99]Put the tree next to it.
[153:49.44]Oh, what the fuck is this?
[153:51.85]Explain what's happening to me.
[154:01.47]Why did that put me into the treehouse?
[154:03.10]It doesn't make any sense.
[154:07.09]I knew you would come, Werner.
[154:10.96]So, you gave my greedy little puss an apple, did you?
[154:15.22]That was much too kind.
[154:18.93]Better beat him, you know?
[154:20.83]Much better to send him away to lick his wounds.
[154:28.26]What?
[154:30.52]I can give you power.
[154:33.26]Power to kill.
[154:33.92]Power to kill.
[154:35.32]Wouldn't you like that, Werner?
[154:40.92]Okay, how?
[154:42.73]Take this key.
[154:44.71]It opens a door in a tunnel not far from here.
[154:49.47]Go and grasp your destiny.
[154:53.64]It's not difficult.
[154:55.88]This is a death mission?
[154:57.00]You'll see.
[155:08.86]Ask for nothing in return.
[155:11.66]Nothing at all.
[155:14.21]Ask...
[155:37.21]Alright.
[155:38.49]You can cover up a fart all you want, but that was definitely a fucking juicy one.
[155:55.67]Yeah, all these sound effects.
[155:58.62]All these, um... Alright, stop.
[156:04.34]now I have this key I gotta go into a cave where's the cave

[156:32.51]I gotta get out of here.
[156:34.83]Where is the cave?
[156:46.46]Go back to the mushroom town and smell the blue flower.
[156:56.35]The sound effects in this game are way too much.
[157:00.35]I can't take them anymore.
[157:05.39]But I'm in it.
[157:07.74]I'm in it to win it here.
[157:13.53]Where's the mushroom town?
[157:19.47]Okay, smell the blue flower here?
[157:36.95]Oh my god!

[157:48.36]Radish!
[157:59.62]Um, excuse me?
[158:00.92]Oh my god, that's fucking terrifying.
[158:04.68]Yep, go, go, go!
[158:06.84]Go anywhere!

[160:14.02]Where is it?
[160:21.18]I don't see it.
[160:24.35]Oh, we're doing save three.
[160:58.66]Wait, he's stuck there.
[160:59.84]Maybe fireball.
[161:17.91]That hurt?
[161:22.36]I don't think I'm hitting him.
[161:27.96]Oh.
[161:30.91]I think it is working.
[161:37.84]I have no mana.
[161:47.01]How about a little fire, scarecrow?
[161:49.40]I like that one.
[161:50.86]Time that person up for one second so they know that I liked their jokes.
[161:54.93]They get to be seen.
[162:13.55]Oh wait, I'm kind of hiding in the bush here.
[162:28.70]Dude, I snuck up on him in the bush.
[162:29.84]This is perfect.
[162:34.45]Hell yeah.
[162:46.00]Okay.
[162:51.30]There's a little bridge over there I can go to.
[162:56.99]Let me try that little bridge.
[163:12.07]The Dreamcast microphone just exploded in price.
[163:15.97]Oh my god.
[163:17.05]It's now $6,500.
[163:21.60]Who just jumped in there and was there like a bidding war for that?
[163:30.49]Holy shit.
[163:34.00]When does it end?
[163:34.62]In like 10 minutes?
[163:35.34]20 minutes?
[163:44.89]It ends in eight minutes.
[163:48.84]Okay, this is by far the worst reversing of the game so far.
[163:53.58]Like, there's no... I should be able to walk straight.
[163:56.55]But I can only go left, but then I can't go straight, and then... This is by far the worst reversal of the entire game so far.
[164:12.45]They're arguing in the donation names.
[164:17.50]I just want to walk across the bridge.
[164:22.20]Because they found out you put it up your ass.
[164:24.08]I did not do that.
[164:25.77]I'm telling you, that's why I didn't want to even address it.
[164:29.33]Because then people are going to go, wait, he put it up his ass.
[164:32.02]Oh!
[164:42.73]There it is.
[164:44.29]I want to go across this.
[164:51.67]I can't even go over there.
[164:56.21]One person is begging the other what to, like, stop bidding it up?
[165:01.72]In the donation message.
[165:11.19]Okay, so one person is bidding and the other person's begging them to stop.
[165:15.60]Stop, stop, please stop the madness.
[165:21.38]Okay, I can't cross this.
[165:23.27]I think I just have to smell one of the other flowers and get the hell out of here.
[165:25.65]I got like a vial.
[165:26.63]I don't know what that's for.
[165:29.25]But I'm just going to smell the flower and get out of here.
[165:33.12]I don't know which one I need to smell.
[165:35.10]And I'm going to save it because it might kill me.
[165:46.24]Uh, these ones?
[165:50.31]No.
[165:52.41]Blue ones again?
[165:53.01]No.
[165:55.05]Red ones?
[165:59.42]How do I get taller?
[166:07.11]7,500.
[166:07.83]Holy shit.
[166:11.48]You can enter the little mushroom door.
[166:13.30]It's a precise click.
[166:17.07]What the fuck, dude?
[166:18.81]Come on!
[166:25.86]It's at $8,000.
[166:27.45]Someone is paying $8,000 for the Dreamcast microphone.
[166:35.32]Hold on a second.
[166:36.06]It's closing in like five minutes.
[166:37.14]$8,500.
[166:48.69]What are you guys doing?
[166:50.89]Wow.
[166:55.92]That's crazy.
[166:58.44]It's at... No, it's not.
[167:03.03]Five minutes on it.
[167:04.12]I want to look at it.
[167:04.96]Hold on.
[167:09.29]Hold on.
[167:09.47]I'll pause this for a second.
[167:13.90]I want to see it.
[167:22.46]That 9K now?
[167:24.37]Oh my goodness gracious.
[167:30.45]Let me scroll down to it.
[167:31.35]Where is it?
[167:32.20]Right there.
[167:32.88]Auction.
[167:39.57]Wow.
[167:41.79]Four minutes and 17 seconds remaining.
[167:44.35]Who's in the lead of this thing?
[167:53.56]Anonymous has just come in with $9,500.
[167:57.37]Dude, what is going on?
[168:01.69]It just crossed $10,000.
[168:06.36]$10,000.
[168:09.30]What is going on here?
[168:19.41]I don't know.
[168:20.09]If it goes higher than $10,000, that's fucking crazy.
[168:32.92]Be like an auction announcer.
[168:36.40]We've got 10,000 from Anonymous.
[168:37.72]10,000 from Anonymous.
[168:38.52]We've got 9,750 from Anonymous.
[168:41.03]Both back to back.
[168:43.23]Sitting at 10,000.
[168:44.05]We have less than two minutes remaining on this.
[168:46.20]Two minutes, I will tell you.
[168:47.20]Two minutes.
[168:47.78]Three minutes, actually.
[168:48.68]I was completely wrong.
[168:49.52]Three minutes and ten seconds remaining.
[168:58.55]Can you please put another mic up your ass and sell it to me?
[169:00.95]This did not go up anybody's ass.
[169:05.02]It is the Dreamcast microphone that I simply used when I played Seaman and it was a fun time and it was a good experience and it's been claimed.
[169:18.34]Getting down to two minutes.
[169:20.72]If you had told me that something like this was going to go for this kind of money, I remember that the last couple times on the CDawg charity auction stuff, I see how much this stuff goes for, and it's like, that's crazy.
[169:34.79]That's a lot of money.
[169:39.65]You sat on it for a bit in 2018.
[169:42.22]No, I did not.
[169:43.28]What are you talking about?
[169:47.22]I didn't sit on this microphone.
[169:49.14]You were making up random things.
[169:51.32]This did not happen.
[169:59.37]Yes, you did.
[169:59.93]I did not.
[170:08.47]Nobody has a clip of me doing something that did not happen.
[170:11.15]It's still at 10K.
[170:15.75]10,000 from anonymous.
[170:17.75]Oh my god, less than two minutes.
[170:31.73]I wouldn't ask for the clip.
[170:35.81]They're gonna wait to the last second.
[170:37.51]I don't know what's gonna happen here.
[170:39.04]But this is already an astronomical amount of money.
[170:44.34]Ah, uh, somebody named Fuwa Germamoco.
[170:51.47]Just 11,000.
[170:52.41]Oh my god.
[171:04.53]There's one minute left or so.
[171:09.27]Wait, no, it's this three minutes, I think.
[171:12.28]I think did, did, did Doug Doug add maybe some time?
[171:14.57]Oh, it does it automatically.
[171:27.75]If, if somebody, oh, this could go for a while.
[171:31.81]Oh shit.
[171:33.76]It resets to three minutes.
[171:35.20]So people, oh shit.
[171:39.33]It's to prevent this exact thing that we're talking about.
[171:47.50]It's sitting at $11,000 right now.
[171:50.87]It's now at $12,000.
[171:51.93]Anonymous.
[172:00.90]That's crazy.
[172:02.30]I can't even tell you how... I don't even... This is not even like a real... This is like not even real in my brain.
[172:09.46]That's wild.
[172:10.92]$13,000.

[172:32.83]Dude.
[172:38.12]This is crazy.
[172:44.13]This is going into a glass case in somebody's mansion.

[174:31.42]17k.
[174:33.93]Ugh.
[174:40.14]If sitting on things and selling them for charity makes this much money, it's your moral obligation to do so.
[174:45.72]Alright guys, it's the yearly stream.
[174:48.91]I've got 40 objects behind me of different kinds of builds, different kinds of materials.
[174:53.27]I'm going to sit on them all for five minutes each.
[174:56.60]I'm going to sit directly onto them, and we're going to put them up for auction.
[175:15.43]Crazy.
[175:16.00]Well, this could go on for a while.
[175:18.30]So I think, I don't know, man.

[176:32.30]Do you not see it?
[176:35.45]Here we go.
[176:37.93]Alright, here it is.
[176:41.65]$17,000.
[176:42.53]One minute and 16 seconds remaining.

[176:52.65]I didn't put this listing up.
[176:53.81]I didn't use this photo.
[176:55.05]60 seconds.
[177:01.70]Is this going?
[177:02.12]Who's it going to go to?
[177:03.95]Buwa Jermimoko is currently in the lead here.
[177:07.65]That's the most.
[177:09.77]That's an unbelievable amount of money.
[177:18.41]You should outbid them all.
[177:21.98]I drop I'm gonna come in here with 20 000 it's mine that's my Dreamcast microphone no one's getting it oh my god no way this no way holy oh my god
[178:01.86]I'm totally speechless.

[178:04.74]I can't even tell you that I am.
[178:18.62]What the fuck?
[178:26.83]Holy shit.
[178:33.40]This is unbelievable.
[178:34.34]Hopefully this is legitimate, right?
[178:35.78]Like, hopefully this is all legitimate.
[178:38.80]But regardless, it's still crazy to see, yeah.
[178:49.64]They're paying 10k for that?
[178:53.26]Well, they're potentially paying 20k for that.
[178:59.75]So, but yes.
[179:08.34]DougDoug's watching it go up right now, too.
[179:12.21]Yeah, I mean, this is crazy.
[179:19.33]DougDoug tried chatting in your chat, but he got auto-modded.
[179:23.76]Shit.
[179:28.50]The fair market value for this is zero dollars.
[179:31.83]Yeah, I mean, well, how... What do you want me to say?
[179:40.39]Well, I guess how much is a Dreamcast microphone on eBay?
[179:46.50]And then what do you value the signature?
[179:48.81]Hey, what do you value that stream?
[179:51.44]It was the one I used on the stream.
[180:08.84]Well, let's see.
[180:09.40]It's still at that Fuwa Jerma Moko.
[180:34.71]You're only going to get $10.
[180:51.26]Well, however this resolves, this is ridiculous.
[180:54.31]This is crazy.
[181:08.49]There's doctors and lawyers that watch.
[181:17.96]Hey, do we know that there's at least 10 scientists here?
[181:40.58]Wow, this is crazy.
[181:46.09]If it does go for this, that's crazy.
[181:48.58]But it's possible that it could be, you know, it could be not legitimate, right?
[181:56.19]We'll see.
[181:57.35]But that's fucking wild.
[182:01.78]It's $20,000.
[182:15.45]So that's unbelievable.
[182:19.82]I never thought that this was going to go by.
[182:21.22]But when I looked at it the other day and I saw that, yeah, when it was down here, when it was somewhere around like even lower than this, when it was like, yeah, when it was like 5K, 4K, I was like, holy shit, that's crazy.
[182:42.67]So
[182:43.99]If it's all legitimate and if it all goes through, you never know.
[182:46.61]There could be something going on, right?
[182:49.42]But whatever it goes for, if it goes for $5,000, $3,000, $7,000, $8,000, that's unbelievable.
[182:55.55]If it goes for $20,000, that's fucking crazy.
[182:57.63]I've never seen anything like that before.
[183:04.90]It'll automatically go to the next person if the top person does not pay.
[183:09.13]So it's going to go to somebody.
[183:13.55]in this range oh my god it was between like two or three people yeah here's the fear of them fighting in the in the comments I want this please leave it I want this it's I want this is just as bad
[183:43.74]So regardless, this is going for at least $5,000 to $10,000, which is ridiculous.
[183:53.71]We'll see what the final number actually is.
[183:55.39]If it is this, that's crazy.
[183:56.70]But DougDoug, it was a pleasure to participate.
[184:00.48]Whoever actually gets it, if it's you, congratulations.
[184:03.48]That's $20,000 to Monterey Bay Aquarium.
[184:11.81]But yeah, very cool.
[184:14.79]But yeah, thanks, DougDoug, for reaching out.
[184:17.28]That was really fun.
[184:23.79]Alright, let's keep going.
[184:25.33]What was I doing?
[184:27.51]It's 20k for a mic you farted on.
[184:30.04]See, this is the problem with...
[184:31.96]the game of telephone you know why the game of telephone is so powerful and the game of like misinformation and telephone at its very core because all that needs to happen is for have somebody to see that in the chat and first it's hey it's a Dreamcast microphone and he signed it oh wait is that the one that he put his mouth on oh my god I actually think it is the one he put his mouth on oh hey did you know that he put that in his mouth
[184:56.17]Oh, hey, did you know that he put that in his ass?
[184:58.45]Hey, did you know he puts a lot of things in his ass and he sells it?
[185:01.48]Hey, did you guys hear that Jerma, like, is doing this where he puts things in his ass and sells it?
[185:06.89]Do you understand?
[185:07.37]Like, I have no control over this.
[185:15.90]Stop saying it.
[185:21.31]I don't care.
[185:21.95]I'm fucking around.
[185:28.77]you are just three bostonians in a trench coat alright well that was a weird comment are we ready to continue I'm about to go into this I think I'm assuming it's going to be a gnome
[186:02.86]I thought it was going to attack me.
[186:05.62]Thank you, stranger.
[186:08.25]That scorpion's been coming here for many days, hoping for an easy meal to come walking out of a toadstool.
[186:18.34]I'd invite you into my home, but the effect of the flower you ate will soon wear off.
[186:26.25]I got a spell for this.
[186:27.59]Imagine what would happen...
[186:29.96]if you grew to your normal height while you were inside a toadstool.
[186:37.27]We have friends among your people.
[186:41.62]We make a special potion for them.
[186:47.11]Okay, well what did I get?
[186:53.16]Is my inventory too full to have accepted anything?
[187:04.93]Shit.
[187:10.98]Why do I have all this junk?
[187:20.11]Oh no!
[187:20.37]I didn't mean to hit you!
[187:21.40]I didn't mean to!
[187:22.44]I'm trying to pick the spell up!
[187:34.29]I was trying to pick the spell up off the ground.
[187:37.49]And what kind of... What is this thing?
[187:47.47]Stop.
[187:51.09]I don't want to get rid of anything.
[187:52.48]What if I need it?
[188:07.62]Stupid shit, man.
[188:08.74]The flowers?
[188:10.92]I probably need those.
[188:12.32]What about the... What about just this axe?
[188:15.57]I don't care about this axe.
[188:29.60]A Dispel Illusion spell.
[188:31.56]Ooh.
[188:47.90]That's cool.
[188:53.69]That is definitely not the path of wisdom.
[188:55.99]No, it's the path of accidentally right-clicking.
[189:00.95]Because I have an inventory full of garbage.
[189:12.43]Alright, where's the exit?
[189:25.80]Oh boy.
[189:26.50]Oh boy.
[189:48.18]Is there anything else I do here?
[189:49.50]When does this wear off?
[189:51.85]The blue lady is gonna beat your ass?
[189:54.76]Oh, great.
[189:55.80]I'm going to have to have another... another death.
[190:01.43]There's going to have to be... I'm going to have to... another one of the council members or whatever.
[190:10.28]How do I get taller?
[190:18.46]Let's see.
[190:18.72]The effect of the potion is going to wear off.
[190:33.77]Drink this.
[190:38.93]I just drank it and it didn't do anything.
[190:44.92]I just wasted a perfectly good potion.
[190:46.77]I don't even know on what.
[191:07.34]What the hell is going on?
[191:10.80]I'm reloading.
[191:13.97]I don't even know which one it was.
[191:14.95]Was it one, two, or three?
[191:16.75]Or four?
[191:24.90]Maybe because I killed the little goblin, I softlocked myself?
[191:50.59]Okay.
[191:53.21]I don't want to throw the book.
[191:54.35]I'm dumping so much shit right now.
[191:57.30]I have way too many items.
[192:00.04]Get rid of the axe.
[192:03.89]I don't care about the axe.
[192:10.90]Get rid of the bone?
[192:13.67]But what if I need the bone?
[192:24.22]You need that axe.
[192:31.59]What if I, if somebody said I need the axe?
[192:34.35]Hold on a second.
[192:35.03]Let me just, hold on.
[192:35.97]God damn it.
[192:39.40]I need to go in that house and we do the goblin thing again.
[192:42.72]I'm not going to kill the goblin this time.
[192:44.34]Why is that alive?
[193:02.41]Okay, we're good.
[193:21.39]Oh, thank you.
[193:22.27]I couldn't walk out of my house because of that scorpion that was there.
[193:31.70]You have earned my respect and my trust.
[193:35.03]And now I will send you on your way with the spell of illusion.
[193:46.38]I hate this area.
[193:50.33]I don't even know what building it is.
[193:51.71]And it's impossible to navigate.
[193:59.40]Oh, God.
[193:59.92]God.
[194:08.57]Hello!
[194:10.04]We are friends of yours.
[194:12.88]I don't know what to get rid of.
[194:28.40]I guess I can just pick it up and put it in the book.
[194:33.28]Okay.
[194:34.06]I have my spell.
[194:34.82]I'm good to go.
[194:35.46]I'm not gonna hurt this guy.
[194:39.44]Goodbye.
[194:40.04]Do you have anything else to say?
[194:41.34]Now maybe it will... Let me save it, and maybe I'll just start growing when I open up the door.
[195:07.05]No, the effect will wear off soon.
[195:10.07]Wait, I could just touch something.
[195:21.91]No?
[195:24.85]There's a potion in one of the cabinets so you can grow.
[195:29.05]Didn't that asshole just tell me that the effects of the potion are gonna wear off really soon?
[195:33.04]Not, please go into my cabinet and take a human, uh, growth potion!
[195:39.50]I'm killing him.
[195:57.77]Get out of my face!
[196:04.10]What cabinet I'm clicking everywhere Right there right here right there Right there
[196:32.23]It might be in an identical looking house in one of those potion cabinets.
[196:36.58]Oh my god, it's in somebody else's house.
[196:39.10]No, it's right here.
[196:39.74]No.
[196:50.72]What the hell?
[197:02.52]It's going to right click right now.
[197:09.95]You need to please move out of the way.
[197:13.66]I can't click.
[197:16.84]Different mushroom house?
[197:17.61]Okay.
[197:25.76]Oh my god.
[197:26.38]He's actually in the way.
[197:32.80]I'm only... I'm refraining from killing him because I think if I grow out of the mushroom thing, that warrior is going to start attacking me.
[197:41.79]And I'm not ready for that.
[197:44.07]Different house.
[197:46.55]There's one right here.
[197:47.17]Oh my god.
[198:07.14]Of course it's an identical house.
[198:15.79]This motherfucker doesn't even have a super potion to grow.
[198:18.77]Oh my god.
[198:25.24]I have to drink it.
[198:34.96]I'm getting rid of this meat cleaver.
[198:44.35]What happens if I drink it right now?
[199:01.54]I don't think I can.
[199:10.32]Get me out of here.
[199:12.68]I don't even know what I got from being down here besides the illusion spell.
[199:16.28]Which, how important even is that?
[199:32.90]Alright, I'm out.
[199:34.06]Let's go.
[199:35.06]Drink the green potion.
[199:39.08]Oh, thank goodness.
[199:50.77]It was a freaking nightmare.
[199:58.82]Okay.
[200:00.70]I have a key here.
[200:21.55]So where do I go now?
[200:41.42]This is new.
[200:47.45]Am I almost at the castle?
[200:48.29]I feel like this is kind of castle-like, isn't it?
[200:53.07]Oh no, this is where oh shit.
[201:00.72]OK.
[201:05.75]Good thing I didn't throw this away.
[201:06.99]So where do I go from here though?
[201:40.06]I hate this area.
[201:40.89]I hope I never have to come back to this place.
[201:42.89]It is so annoying to navigate anywhere over here.
[201:54.79]Like, did I just go in a circle or is this a different area?
[201:59.06]I fucking hate this place.
[202:19.55]Okay, now what?
[202:23.74]I have a key to a cave.
[202:34.68]Cog?
[202:35.08]I don't know what to do with the cog.
[202:36.66]Is there a cave around here?
[202:50.05]Uh, mods?
[202:53.13]Where's the cave?
[203:11.93]Where's the cave?
[203:17.40]Go back to the red samurai?
[203:18.50]Okay.
[203:28.00]I don't remember what path it is.
[203:45.32]Being very honest.
[203:54.24]So easy to get turned around because this just looks like the entrance, but it's not.
[204:02.57]This way?
[204:06.55]This is where the flowers are.
[204:09.27]Oh, then you go further from here, right?
[204:13.48]There's another place to go over here.
[204:20.20]Do-do-do-do-do-do.
[204:22.98]Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[204:36.68]Where's the cave?
[204:45.89]Is this a cave?
[204:47.80]This does not look like a cave, but whatever.
[205:01.80]I mean, if I had to guess it would be right here.
[205:06.38]But it doesn't look like I can go forward from here.
[205:27.42]I mean that that that's a weird door.
[205:34.18]Wait.
[205:35.48]An illusion.
[205:37.72]An illusion.
[205:38.40]Fidget spinner, the Olympics, and flowers.
[206:07.96]Ooh, an illusion.
[206:12.82]Interesting.
[206:25.97]Hmm.
[206:26.07]Left or right?
[206:29.99]Go left first.
[206:40.09]Right.
[206:50.77]Right.
[206:54.57]Oh my god, I figured it out.
[206:59.54]Another dragon warrior?
[207:01.11]If you go to the Dolmen's world, you won't see me.
[207:05.84]A dragon knight worth his salt wields power, and you wield neither power nor pity.
[207:12.89]You hesitate like some dog between two bones.
[207:17.16]You will meet many creatures, man and beast.
[207:21.66]Will you show them pity or crush them beneath your heel?
[207:26.69]sometimes you will have no choice but often you will and that is when the scales may be tipped towards strength or weakness power or pity what's the duck from the blood one of the one of the uncle ducks from Disney the scientist
[207:58.87]No, you know the one?
[207:59.70]The one that's like, Ah, I've created a new... Yes, I have a great new potion for you, Mickey.
[208:10.21]Omega Lull, Uncle Duck.
[208:11.81]One of the duck characters in DuckTales or whatever it is.
[208:20.56]It's Ludwig von Drake.
[208:24.11]Ludwig von Drake, yes.
[208:25.79]He's got the glasses and he's...
[208:29.49]I have a torch now.
[208:40.46]Alright, so... Now what?
[208:48.59]You mean to tell me I have to go all the way back?
[208:52.98]I'm not gonna even figure out the correct way to go back.
[208:54.66]This is gonna be so fucked over.
[209:03.32]I'm so fucked over.
[209:17.80]Oh shit.
[209:21.14]A mystical, magical well.
[209:32.40]Build the canteen here.
[209:40.15]Come on, really?
[209:47.73]How is it possible?
[209:53.16]Is it this one?
[209:57.69]I can't get any closer now.
[210:03.04]Maybe it's the blue potion.
[210:09.60]I'll save it.
[210:16.71]Need a bucket?
[210:30.60]the bull the cow the bull dude I'm gonna get trapped in here thank goodness I made it out okay my image sits in the dolman seat for the present you have my support
[210:48.06]You walk the narrow path between power and pity.
[210:52.65]That is no easy road.
[210:54.43]Alright.
[210:54.69]I think I'm going to, uh, I think I'm going to call it for today.
[210:59.06]Or you will lose my vote.
[211:02.22]I did say I was only streaming for a couple of hours.
[211:10.03]It's been about three and a half.
[211:10.89]I said maybe two or three.
[211:12.23]Uh, I'll be live in a few days.
[211:16.72]I feel like I want to beat this, though.
[211:24.37]I feel like this has got my attention at least to a point where I want to finish it.
[211:29.06]There's more paths in that maze.
[211:30.84]We'll see them next time.
[211:33.77]I want to play water parks.
[211:34.77]The next room will be a lot longer.
[211:36.31]I just want to go for the morning here.
[211:40.65]The next room will be a lot longer.
[211:42.97]It'll be about probably five or six hours next time.
[211:45.61]I want to do this and I want to do water park sim.
[211:50.76]I'll see you probably on... What's today?
[211:55.23]Sunday, right?
[212:01.04]Probably Wednesday?
[212:03.26]Wednesday or Thursday?
[212:10.97]Yeah, Wednesday or Thursday sounds good to me.
[212:13.13]Probably Thursday, but I might show up on Wednesday.
[212:16.86]We'll do Waterpark Sim and finish this.
[212:26.07]But this game... I love this game.
[212:27.79]It's so weird.
[212:29.53]I definitely want to see the end of it.
[212:38.86]But yeah, the...
[212:41.23]The auction is now closed.
[212:45.01]Thanks to everybody that was bidding on that.
[212:46.88]Obviously.
[212:51.36]And I'll see you in a few days.
[212:54.13]I'm invested in this too for some reason.
[212:55.55]We need to see the end.
[212:56.73]There's been so many games that I've started and just not gone back to ever again.
[213:00.13]But I have to see the end of this game.
[213:02.88]Don't spoil yourself.
[213:04.06]Save it.
[213:05.28]Don't go watch the VOD.
[213:06.66]Don't go watch the walkthrough.
[213:10.69]We need to see how this ends.
[213:14.02]I'll see you in a few days.
[213:16.46]Take care, see you later.
[213:20.23]It's still pretty early, so the day is still in front of a lot of us, I think.
[213:34.59]VRJosh just said, I'm about 45 minutes into a two hour long play of the game.
[213:41.79]How?
[213:44.28]How?
[213:48.42]Well, I guess if you know exactly where you're going and you know exactly what to click on, then I guess, yeah.
[213:55.55]They know all the puzzle answers and they know everywhere.
[213:57.35]Okay, so that's like how long it takes to just run through the whole game if you know everything and everywhere to go.
[214:16.06]Is it going to be a nine part stream?
[214:18.79]Well, no, judging by that.
[214:22.65]That means we're just about at the halfway point.
[214:26.14]And the stream only was about three hours.
[214:28.46]We took about 20 or 30 minutes to hang out for the auction.
[214:32.69]So this was genuinely probably two to three hours of actually being in the game.
[214:37.35]And we got to the halfway point.
[214:38.37]So there's probably like another three to four hours, which is perfect because that will get us right to the point where I want us to get to on the next stream.
[214:54.84]But yeah, see you later.
[214:55.93]Take care of yourselves.
[214:57.06]Have a great rest of your day.
[214:58.85]And goodbye.
