[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.71]The music stopped.
[00:08.11]Because I'm opening another game.
[00:12.76]As you know.
[00:13.84]As you are aware.
[00:19.52]I'm going to mute this one more time.
[00:20.78]Give me one sec.
[00:45.46]Okay.
[00:49.78]I need to change this.
[00:51.00]I'm going to change the game as well.
[00:56.78]I need to go like this.
[00:59.85]Move you over.
[01:04.01]That looks better.
[01:06.25]That's better.
[01:07.69]Right?
[01:07.91]Eh.
[01:14.47]Hmm.
[01:19.85]That looks good.
[01:25.04]So, from last time, I was about to lose very, very, very awfully.
[01:32.72]My partner was doing terrible.
[01:36.08]Well, let's see if I can do anything here.
[01:41.65]Here's my magic three.
[01:42.87]Okay.
[01:45.37]Okay.
[01:50.65]The yellow bar.
[01:52.49]I'll get rid of the yellow bar.
[01:54.23]Ready?
[01:55.11]Check this out.
[01:55.89]Gone.
[01:57.03]Not even there.
[01:57.49]Alright.
[02:00.14]Updated.
[02:00.74]Load game.
[02:01.34]It was a single scenario.
[02:05.76]Which one was it?
[02:09.16]I have no idea.
[02:11.02]Timeline 2?
[02:12.66]Battle?
[02:13.32]Do we have times on these?
[02:14.56]We do.
[02:16.93]Is it Conquerors?
[02:17.89]530?
[02:17.91]No.
[02:22.12]5.29 5.30 at 20.39 5.30 at 18.08 Original team timeline.
[02:32.42]There we go.
[02:35.54]Yep.
[02:35.78]23.58.
[02:35.80]That's just before midnight.
[02:36.97]I think this is it.
[02:42.89]Am I not playing Sam & Max?
[02:44.05]I just did.
[02:45.99]I completed Season 2.
[02:48.25]Now I need to complete this.
[02:54.54]That is what we're doing today.
[02:55.52]Alright, let's go here.
[02:59.78]I think this is it.
[03:00.38]Let's see.
[03:06.83]So it was... Purple was doing nothing.
[03:08.97]Purple has like a Dwarf in here, right?
[03:12.35]I need to finish my losing campaign.
[03:14.09]We have to get closure, but it's not lost yet.
[03:18.07]Remember, I was wiping out people.
[03:21.49]I was taking people out left and right.
[03:24.15]He doesn't have very much left.
[03:25.41]He has this.
[03:26.67]And that's it.
[03:30.17]Change the game?
[03:30.65]I already did.
[03:32.95]You need to refresh your browser.
[03:35.91]Refresh your Twitch browser, please.
[03:40.31]It's not over yet.
[03:42.01]See, he's starting to build up a little bit.
[03:44.05]Red is almost dead.
[03:50.00]So, let's see what I can do.
[03:51.97]Let me try to remember what the plan... I still have, like, good army.
[03:55.60]I'm going to be making money.
[03:56.42]I have tons of money.
[03:58.40]Let's go down here.
[04:00.70]Alright, lots of money.
[04:01.84]What do I want to build?
[04:03.30]Behemoth lair.
[04:04.04]Let's build it.
[04:04.52]I got the money.
[04:08.03]Let's just start... Get him.
[04:09.21]Okay, we got a behemoth.
[04:17.99]Still can move around here.
[04:21.31]Alright, is this this is the big one here and then Not that well defended he only only has like one castle that has anything in it two maybe but if I can I just I just need purple to do anything.
[04:44.78]Alright, here we go.
[04:45.76]I'm going for it Like right here
[04:51.63]Let me just take this.
[04:55.28]Everything's good down here.
[04:56.42]New day.
[05:00.44]Did you actually just take that from purple?
[05:08.16]How is red still alive?
[05:10.30]I don't understand.
[05:12.56]Like, red sucks.
[05:14.72]I have to send somebody over here to do something about this, because this is all red has.
[05:21.22]They don't have anything else.
[05:24.52]Okay, what do we got?
[05:25.26]Let's build some more stuff.
[05:27.48]Uh... Crisis Goblin production.
[05:34.29]Orc Tower.
[05:35.27]Upgrade the Behemoth Lair.
[05:39.21]Maybe.
[05:41.49]Just to have better Behemoths.
[05:44.64]What's the difference?
[05:48.56]Target enemy's defenses reduced by 80%.
[05:50.71]That's pretty awesome.
[05:55.93]Increase that volume just a little.
[05:57.13]Alright.
[06:00.35]Things are not looking bad.
[06:01.47]I have tons of troop availability.
[06:03.43]I just need some money.
[06:04.17]Let's just even them out a little.
[06:08.30]Alright, you got several.
[06:10.08]Few, few, few, and few.
[06:12.58]He has...
[06:16.96]I don't... That's not enough.
[06:19.19]That's not enough to get this.
[06:21.69]It's enough to get... I really should just go up here.
[06:31.71]Or all the way up.
[06:40.34]What about down here?
[06:45.26]Well, just get all the resources.
[06:51.28]You're fucked?
[06:52.18]Yeah, I know.
[06:53.30]I know, but still.
[06:55.22]It's still possible.
[06:56.40]Well, these guys are gonna run away.
[06:59.36]Give me this.
[07:02.95]Several... I think I can do this.
[07:06.87]What do we got down here?
[07:08.73]Tons of fucking people to buy.
[07:09.99]Eh, just go for it.
[07:15.11]Alright, there's red.
[07:15.73]There's red.
[07:16.05]There's red.
[07:16.89]They're both out here now.
[07:23.28]Come on, go for it.
[07:24.44]Take something.
[07:25.08]Help me out here.
[07:25.72]I need to build.
[07:39.41]I already got this stuff.
[07:45.37]Yeah, just claim all the resources.
[07:49.79]The map is shit.
[07:50.57]That's the problem.
[07:51.11]I played a tough game, but was able to use the map to my advantage to pull off an upset.
[07:55.13]Yeah.
[07:58.63]But it's still possible.
[07:59.79]I can't just give up right now.
[08:01.97]I mean... This was such a good comeback.
[08:07.45]I had such an opportunity.
[08:08.67]I can't.
[08:09.65]I'm like sunk cost fallacy right now.
[08:13.35]I just gotta get somebody up there.
[08:15.06]Where's my nearest castle?
[08:19.90]Right here.
[08:20.34]Either right there or right here.
[08:23.00]This is probably faster because it's a straight line.
[08:25.97]Alright, what can I do in here?
[08:29.31]I got plenty of fucking people next time.
[08:31.57]What about you?
[08:32.01]Let's go with you.
[08:35.07]Several horde lots.
[08:38.68]Wait, do you think I can do it?
[08:43.16]Think I can take this castle over right now?
[08:48.88]What button do I press to hire all available units?
[08:51.76]I'll show you.
[08:54.02]So in here... Right here?
[08:56.76]It's this little castle building.
[08:57.90]You click it and it'll show you all available that you can buy.
[09:00.78]And you can just buy them all.
[09:04.06]No, I can't.
[09:04.98]How does it take like a... What about this one?
[09:08.10]No.
[09:08.78]What about up here?
[09:11.91]These are easier to take.
[09:19.29]You know, just, like, get over there.
[09:22.45]How far away is he?
[09:23.24]He's really fucking far away, isn't he?
[09:26.70]Yeah, he's, like, too far away to do this.
[09:32.80]What do you have?
[09:39.15]Fuck, is this- is this a dead game?
[09:40.77]This might be dead.
[09:48.90]You horde pack.
[09:51.22]Fuck.
[09:51.98]No, I was doing so well, too.
[09:54.98]I'm playing it out.
[09:55.68]Here comes red.
[10:05.72]Down to here.
[10:06.76]Which, what do I have here?
[10:07.62]Alright, let's get some units in here.
[10:12.45]What do you have?
[10:15.35]Horde, horde.
[10:16.21]He has a lot, but horde of fairies is nothing.
[10:23.58]This should be okay.
[10:29.06]I'll give this another few rounds and then decide if it's time to throw the towel in.
[10:35.67]How do I get up here?
[10:36.29]I mean, I am claiming a bunch of shit, but it doesn't matter.
[10:49.79]They've... Damn it.
[10:53.51]Here we go.
[10:53.91]They're coming in.
[10:54.97]I might be okay here.
[11:02.10]What's the most dangerous thing?
[11:03.50]This?
[11:07.84]Okay.
[11:12.04]I wonder if I should just fly out the dragon, but probably not.
[11:16.18]I can't.
[11:16.88]No spells.
[11:17.28]No hero in here.
[11:23.69]50 elementals?
[11:24.31]Yeah, but they have to get in.
[11:29.58]I have one unit in double digits and it's the frog.
[11:34.54]Well, I'm not gonna get out there yet.
[11:38.90]Wait, they can fly?
[11:39.80]No, they can't, can they?
[11:45.64]I mean, they can.
[11:49.54]I have, like, minotaurs, too.
[11:50.74]I should be alright once we...
[11:53.78]I mean, there's just one Harpy here.
[11:58.59]Fuck, they can fly.
[12:00.99]Yeah, this is bad.
[12:01.89]I don't have a hero to cast any spells.
[12:12.58]Hey, look at me!
[12:13.02]I'm gonna come over here!
[12:22.88]They still have to get in.
[12:30.19]These are all powerful units.
[12:31.35]I think it's time for me to get out of here.
[12:37.79]He's just gonna fly in.
[12:38.81]I can kill these guys.
[12:43.26]There you are.
[12:48.32]One hit kill.
[12:50.62]I could go out there and meet them on an open field, I'm not gonna do that though.
[12:59.45]Here they are, at the front door.
[13:03.17]Just cheese them.
[13:09.95]Good, be the bait for the ranged attacks here.
[13:14.03]Fuck, it's open.
[13:15.95]Well... They can get in now!
[13:24.30]I think I should just fly out here.
[13:31.15]Just stand, like, right here.
[13:32.49]No, hold on.
[13:39.58]Not yet.
[13:42.72]Get down here.
[13:44.90]Nobody do anything.
[13:56.41]In the moat.
[14:02.42]Right in the moat.
[14:03.02]Nice.
[14:03.96]Perfect.
[14:06.20]Come on.
[14:08.26]Alright, where's my dragon?
[14:11.80]From this angle.
[14:12.96]Get him!
[14:17.60]I could probably kill these in one or two hits.
[14:30.99]Fuck the dragon in the way.
[14:36.99]Come on.
[14:37.51]I don't want to fly him out there.
[14:38.55]They're gonna get in.
[14:43.38]Block the entrance!
[14:47.76]This is not terrible.
[14:49.14]I'm okay with this.
[14:57.04]It's alright.
[14:57.46]It's not over.
[15:09.41]This is the only unit that's really scary.
[15:11.29]Get rid of this.
[15:16.17]Done?
[15:16.71]No, come on.
[15:18.99]Good.
[15:19.33]Okay, Minotaurs, head down here.
[15:26.06]It doesn't matter, you're not gonna do shit.
[15:30.38]Ah, fuck, I just blocked the angle.
[15:32.32]Completely.
[15:33.28]Go up here.
[15:48.02]Chimera's gonna die.
[15:48.88]Alright, come on.
[15:52.00]What do I have?
[15:52.64]50?
[15:52.66]12 to 20?
[15:54.10]They don't do that much damage.
[15:57.56]Get in there.
[16:05.67]God damn it, die!
[16:07.15]Why can't I shoot anybody from here?
[16:21.89]This sucks.
[16:24.49]Out of ammo.
[16:25.65]Oh, yeah.
[16:28.47]Well, unfortunately, this is going to be really, really close, but it's not going to be enough.
[16:32.55]Fuck.
[16:37.48]That's game over.
[16:38.16]You don't even have 50 of these things.
[16:40.92]Shit.
[16:49.38]Shit.
[16:51.03]I didn't have a hero in here.
[16:55.61]Just fly.
[16:56.35]Just run away.
[16:59.18]Eventually I'm going to get hit by that arrow.
[17:03.22]Yeah, eventually this will kill me.
[17:10.92]Yeah, I'm dead.
[17:16.03]This is so sad.
[17:19.53]Now this might be unwinnable.
[17:26.29]Can I look at, like, stats?
[17:27.46]You know what I mean?
[17:31.80]Can I see if they've done any damage to any other player?
[17:38.84]Fucking 2v2.
[17:42.84]In the tavern.
[17:46.39]I wanna see.
[17:59.40]Number of towns.
[18:00.26]Gold.
[18:01.64]Plenty of wood and ore.
[18:11.85]Look at this shit.
[18:13.05]Attack is zero.
[18:17.08]Zero, two, two, two.
[18:21.16]How can you not be there?
[18:24.52]How is it possible?
[18:28.74]Can I steal his... Can I take his ore?
[18:31.70]Warrior, Human, Explorer, Builder.
[18:34.56]Oh well.
[18:38.06]It's not completely... I still have the one... I have this one really good army.
[18:43.11]I'm gonna go for it.
[18:44.57]Like, fuck it.
[18:45.15]Let's just go for it.
[18:46.85]I'm gonna stack units and then we're gonna go.
[18:53.23]Bone Dragons.
[18:56.72]What has, like, the best, uh... Let's see.
[19:01.22]You got good shit.
[19:02.64]All these places have good shit, but I don't have enough money.
[19:11.04]I might as well just buy all this.
[19:14.72]And then bring you down there eventually.
[19:16.32]The vampires will do work.
[19:24.44]Yeah, I just I think I'm just overwhelmed at this point.
[19:26.66]I don't think it's like possible It was worth a shot Alright, can you move what the hell are you doing?
[19:46.45]Because I need to go to here with you So you got to get up there next turn
[19:55.54]What do you got here?
[19:56.22]Nothing?
[19:56.88]Literally nothing.
[19:58.30]Although you are right next to it.
[20:03.40]More heroes can do more stuff?
[20:05.00]Yeah, that's true, but it's, remember, it's 2v1 right now.
[20:09.73]Because purple ain't doing shit.
[20:13.89]Purple's walking around in a circle, picking up the same three resources.
[20:25.68]Can I get anything from here?
[20:30.54]I guess I could just... Just to take them.
[20:34.94]Take the... Unicorns.
[20:37.94]Just to have better... Army for now.
[20:42.10]I don't really want these.
[20:45.28]I guess I could take these too.
[20:46.68]Just in case I run into somebody.
[20:47.58]Alright, anything else?
[20:52.36]So before I go up here and get some more vampires...
[20:58.92]Guys, Dwarf's going to take this one.
[21:02.04]I'm going to get this one.
[21:03.84]Restock, take over this one, and see what happens.
[21:06.12]Where are the vampires?
[21:13.79]They don't have upgraded vampires?
[21:18.51]No, you do.
[21:18.85]No, you don't.
[21:19.65]Wait, what?
[21:22.39]How do you not have this?
[21:32.16]There are bone dragons here.
[21:33.26]Okay.
[21:38.95]Next day!
[21:40.83]What?
[21:44.61]Did he just take me on?
[21:49.60]I don't think he wins this.
[21:56.20]I'm gonna have to... Okay, I'm gonna have to do some... I don't have, like, Ice Arrow?
[22:04.31]Who's more dangerous?
[22:06.61]Wyverns.
[22:07.33]Fuck.
[22:07.82]He has eight Wyverns.
[22:11.26]That's very bad.
[22:11.98]Just hang out here for a second.
[22:24.95]What the fuck just happened?
[22:29.79]He just did Armageddon.
[22:33.09]Come on.
[22:34.63]What?

[22:59.73]Ahhhh.
[23:03.87]I'm so defeated right now.
[23:05.09]That sucks.
[23:07.33]I probably would have done it too.
[23:19.62]Yeah, there goes my other hero.
[23:31.37]Let's see what purple's up to.
[23:35.24]I wonder.
[23:36.92]Oh, okay.
[23:41.06]What did you do?
[23:42.05]Let me see.
[23:47.33]Nice, nice.
[23:47.93]So you walked from like here to here.
[23:50.67]Cool.
[23:54.98]You better stack this fucking castle up.
[23:57.16]Now.
[24:00.94]Plan doesn't change.
[24:02.06]We're still going to this castle.
[24:09.92]Sherma's angry already.
[24:11.20]I'm just remembering how annoyed I was with my teammate.
[24:15.92]I know I'm like the salty boy after, you know, you can't blame the teammate, but yes you can.
[24:23.28]You can.
[24:25.00]I'm sorry.
[24:25.54]You can.
[24:32.54]I'm gonna drown here.
[24:33.72]I'm gonna drown.
[24:34.66]He has to take something.
[24:35.68]Please take something.
[24:38.61]I put like nine hours into this campaign.
[24:41.49]I can't give up on it.
[24:45.81]Get over here right now.
[24:48.05]Come here.
[24:49.37]Give me all your stuff.
[24:54.47]Give it to me.
[24:55.05]I can't take it from you?
[24:56.46]I can only give.
[24:57.22]I can't take.
[24:57.74]No, no, no.
[24:59.50]I don't want to give you my fucking dragons.
[25:02.44]What?
[25:02.76]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[25:20.71]No.
[25:21.77]I can't... Oh my fucking god.
[25:35.42]Okay, so one guy just said it's because my army is full and now I just gave him my fucking angels.
[25:46.04]Somebody said it's because your army's full.
[25:48.40]Gotta watch that stress.
[25:51.76]You just got the best fucking... Why can I give what I can't take from my ally?
[25:57.87]He's not gonna give to me.
[25:59.07]He's run by a fucking computer.
[26:02.41]Really?
[26:07.35]Close window, select left hero.
[26:16.78]And he's not going to do anything.
[26:17.52]He's going to take those units and walk around in a circle down here.
[26:20.67]Just don't press the checkmark.
[26:22.97]Can I just exit?
[26:28.41]No.
[26:38.07]No.
[26:39.19]No.
[26:40.49]I needed these so bad.
[26:42.11]I think that's the point where I quit.
[26:49.36]I haven't saved in a long time.
[26:54.94]When was the last autosave?
[27:00.40]Let's see.
[27:10.70]Is this it?
[27:15.28]It is.
[27:15.66]Okay.
[27:17.00]Thank god.
[27:23.19]Don't ever listen to chat.
[27:24.41]No one's ever played this game.
[27:26.63]No, I mean, it was a good- it was a decent theory.
[27:34.52]The losing campaign continues.
[27:36.72]Yes, it does.
[27:37.28]Alright.
[27:44.06]If I'm gonna lose, I'm gonna lose.
[27:45.30]I'm not gonna just quit.
[27:50.68]You got me to download this game?
[27:51.72]Good, it's fantastic.
[27:52.82]I hope you enjoy it.
[27:54.14]It's a really, really good game.
[28:00.36]He already owned that windmill and he touched it again.
[28:03.18]I hate this guy.
[28:05.06]Alright, let's stock up again.
[28:10.85]Got more vampires.
[28:14.94]I'm gonna leave the angels, because, uh... What do you think?
[28:18.22]Angels or, um... Dendroids?
[28:32.77]Looks kind of good.
[28:35.83]And here is my only hope.
[28:37.84]Are you ready?
[28:39.04]It's called Turtle Forever.
[28:42.14]and just try to get like 15 dragons and like 150 vampires.
[28:45.54]I need to upgrade the skeletons though.
[29:02.15]That's my only shot.
[29:03.81]Somebody's got to come out with these.
[29:05.53]This is like not a bad army either.
[29:06.93]I'll make a new hero.
[29:18.09]Jeremy, you already made this Australia joke?
[29:20.85]Well, at this point, it's not a joke.
[29:22.09]It's real life.
[29:23.19]I'm living in reality right now.
[29:27.27]They're coming for me, and I'm not gonna go down.
[29:36.70]Winners don't turtle.
[29:39.66]Alright, so I want this one.
[29:45.22]Upgrade the skeletons.
[29:49.36]I have already upgraded.
[29:50.38]I need to do this.
[29:53.14]What do I need for that?
[29:55.27]Dragon Vault?
[29:55.95]I already have Dreadknights.
[29:58.63]Alright, Dragon Vault.
[30:00.29]15,000 gold.
[30:00.59]We're doing it.
[30:01.01]Let's just save the money.
[30:07.42]While we have the second here, let's get a new hero.
[30:09.12]Because there are ancient behemoths that are here now.
[30:19.57]Okay, we need... Resource silo... Goblin barracks... Ogre fort... Escape tunnel... No, let's just get a hero.
[30:40.87]I mean, yeah.
[30:43.41]I really... It needs to be this person.
[30:46.70]Okay, you hang out there for now.
[30:48.59]I'm gonna get you an army too.
[30:51.03]You take this because no one has even secured it.
[30:54.21]What the fuck are they thinking?
[30:59.35]I got the new spell.
[31:02.67]I'm ready.
[31:09.38]They're all working together.
[31:10.26]He has so many heroes, he doesn't know what to do with it.
[31:14.54]This one just stood still.
[31:18.04]He has like 12 heroes across two players and now they're coming for me.
[31:24.76]No, what do you have?
[31:25.66]Ah!
[31:28.20]I don't think it's possible to defend this.
[31:30.89]A pack of... Oh, god damn it.
[31:35.71]Just when I think I'm... I get a minute to breathe.
[31:39.21]Well... I'm gonna try.
[31:41.97]I'm gonna try to defend it with my level 1 hero.
[31:52.81]Two more days through until a new week.
[31:54.09]What do you got?
[31:55.25]Lots of you this game I don't think I'm gonna be able to do this one I need like a final battle though just so I can say that I completed it
[32:13.23]It was game over two hours ago.
[32:14.49]Yeah, I know.
[32:15.35]But I just had to see it again, because I left really abruptly.
[32:18.27]You come with your fire birds.
[32:21.48]Look at this monster.
[32:25.22]This is just pathetic.
[32:44.15]The behemoths didn't do anything.
[32:46.23]No, this is just embarrassing, really.
[32:47.97]Yeah, at least I'm trying, right?
[32:56.24]Start a new map?
[32:57.54]Um, I don't think so.
[32:59.88]I think I'm gonna hold on to that, because then the same situation will happen.
[33:03.60]I'll get, like, a quarter of the way through a map.
[33:06.25]I'd rather do, like, a full, like, seven to ten hour stream of the game.
[33:10.75]Rather than play it for, like, another hour or two on a new map, and then we save it, and it disappears for two weeks.
[33:17.71]Tomorrow is cooking simulators.
[33:19.23]We're not doing it tomorrow.
[33:20.05]We may as well just die.
[33:33.34]Do a real cooking stream.
[33:36.64]Worth mentioning that this is $3.39 right now on good old games.
[33:40.85]Just get it.
[33:42.93]This is less than a fucking medium coffee at Starbucks.
[33:45.53]Go get this game.
[33:47.79]Seriously.
[33:58.16]Unfortunately, the first stream I did, the game I think was $10.
[34:07.78]And this is where we lose.
[34:10.40]I need one more big battle.
[34:13.43]There's going to be one more big battle that I have to at least go out with.
[34:17.21]You know, I can't just lose.
[34:20.13]I'm sticking my tongue out at them while they rush.
[34:26.48]I got it because I saw you playing it?
[34:28.76]Yeah, it's very interesting.
[34:32.28]It's a very, very fun, chill game.
[34:36.06]Big one-sided battle?
[34:37.46]I don't think so.
[34:38.78]Next, this next week here, I'm gonna, I'm taking off.
[34:41.70]And we'll see what we can do with upgraded bone dragons.
[34:43.60]I'll have like six of them.
[34:54.08]Jeremy needs to get spanked hard before he goes to his room for good.
[34:59.40]No, you're talking about like in the getting beat in the game.
[35:02.78]Oh my god.
[35:03.52]What the fuck?
[35:05.38]Alright, it's almost time to go out here.
[35:08.12]I still have another castle.
[35:13.96]Podcast listener just gave $50.
[35:20.03]Podcast listener, thank you for the 50 bucks, 5,000 bits.
[35:26.45]Love your streams, dude.
[35:27.24]Thanks for everything you do.
[35:28.08]Jeremiah Hart.
[35:31.90]Much love.
[35:32.86]Back to you.
[35:33.50]Thank you for the 50 fucking dollars.
[35:35.24]5,000 bits podcast listener.
[35:40.12]Thank you so much.
[35:47.39]It's a lot of money.
[35:50.39]5,000 bits.
[35:51.37]There have been like three or four of these tonight.
[35:54.47]Thank you, guys.
[35:56.65]Twitch added a reward system?
[35:59.31]They did?
[36:01.43]What do you mean, reward system?
[36:08.58]You get, like, bits or something?
[36:09.82]What does that mean?
[36:11.32]I don't know what it means.
[36:11.90]Alright, here comes the next week.
[36:14.20]I'm ready to move.
[36:15.20]I'm gonna fucking explode here.
[36:25.44]I gotta go out with a bang.
[36:29.43]I have to take somebody with me.
[36:31.43]And like part of me is like actually thinking about declaring war on Purple and killing him.
[36:36.27]Can I do that?
[36:36.85]Is that possible?
[36:48.50]Can I?
[36:48.90]Is there a way?
[36:52.86]Did Purple go through the same portal loop three times?
[36:55.21]Probably.
[36:59.58]Um... System options... scenario info?
[37:05.44]Is there declare war?
[37:06.60]No, I can't declare war.
[37:14.98]That's unfortunate.
[37:17.18]Alright, here we go.
[37:20.66]Two more dragons.
[37:26.76]Four more of these.
[37:29.24]Eight more of these.
[37:31.84]I should have a substantial army at this point.
[37:37.52]Some more skeletons.
[37:39.18]And then we're going to upgrade the dragons.
[37:40.56]And then we're going to get the hell out of here.
[37:42.18]And I'm going to just steamroll somebody.
[37:54.57]Moldalon IRL.
[37:57.32]I'm not sure you're aware of this, but there is not really much thing as a lawn in Las Vegas.
[38:06.33]It'd be mold of rocks.
[38:11.26]Hey, let's do it again!
[38:12.20]Back to bed!
[38:19.06]Rake the sand.
[38:22.04]What do I need?
[38:22.41]10,000? 15,000?
[38:28.12]I think he just took something from me.
[38:42.90]Oh, damn.
[38:49.32]God damn it.
[38:49.82]Okay, here we go.
[38:53.19]Dragon Vault.
[38:54.57]There it is.
[38:56.49]Now I need to wait one more day.
[38:58.66]I may as well just wait the whole week.
[39:08.13]What did he just do that for?
[39:12.97]They're just- he's just playing with portals now.
[39:15.49]He just did the portal infinite loop thing for fun.
[39:27.20]I have super dragons.
[39:29.76]Look, let's just wait the whole week.
[39:31.00]I'm just waiting the whole week.
[39:31.94]Who cares?
[39:32.34]I already lost.
[39:34.30]It doesn't matter.
[39:34.80]I don't care about this.
[39:47.77]Nothing matters.
[39:48.27]Don't even give him satisfaction.
[39:52.60]Run through the escape hole.
[39:54.40]What is this?
[40:00.24]Oh, turn on auto combat.
[40:05.58]I can't even surrender.
[40:06.82]There's no one to surrender.
[40:16.35]Hey, at least I took out one of their sand wind people.
[40:29.55]this is sad sad it's okay at least I saw it to its completion that's all I care about here's what I will be really mad about though if I lose before purple does that's what's gonna happen that's so I'm gonna be I'm gonna go to sleep tonight angry I'm not supposed to get angry
[41:00.13]What does Purple have?
[41:00.95]Purple has, like, two castles and, like, two or three heroes.
[41:14.18]What does Purple have?
[41:14.92]Does Purple even have a house?
[41:16.68]Yeah, look, he's, I mean, doesn't have shit, but still.
[41:19.40]Uh-oh, here we go.
[41:21.62]Yes, I could stop this right now, but I'm not going to.
[41:24.12]I want him to die.
[41:26.02]Just so I can at least be the one that survived.
[41:30.82]Let's watch this one, boys and girls.
[41:32.06]Let's see how this happens.
[41:37.20]No, you're not gonna do it.
[41:45.70]Sabotage.
[41:51.49]Alright.
[41:54.39]This is the end.
[41:57.67]Eight Ghost Dragons...
[42:01.34]29.
[42:01.60]I gotta wait to get some more vampires.
[42:05.40]We're gonna wait.
[42:09.12]Here's the thing, though.
[42:10.28]This really might be really powerful, and I might kill at least two or three of their heroes.
[42:29.88]And then I'll die.
[42:30.82]It's okay.
[42:31.26]At least I'll die going down.
[42:33.73]Wait, no.
[42:34.11]At least I'll fight.
[42:35.77]I'll take him on.
[42:37.59]Whatever what I'm trying to say is just... Give me another week.

[45:38.53]Where do I go first?
[45:39.25]Alright, you decide.
[45:41.70]Where are we going?
[45:43.28]Top left?
[45:43.98]Top right?
[45:44.66]Bottom right?
[45:45.26]Or bottom left?
[45:45.96]Which one?
[45:52.96]Stay put!
[45:53.80]Wait, you want me just to sit here?
[45:57.32]Stay put?
[45:59.80]Hold!
[46:00.24]I... I have to get out of here!
[46:06.63]You want me to stay?
[46:10.28]I can't just stay here.
[46:11.40]It's never gonna end.
[46:12.96]They're never gonna stop running around and collecting resources.
[46:30.84]No, I gotta go.
[46:32.72]I gotta go.
[46:34.64]They won't even come over here.
[46:35.70]I have to go to them.
[46:36.50]They're never gonna come over here.
[46:38.56]I'm going.
[46:39.98]Getting 999 skeletons.
[46:41.76]That's gonna take fucking like seven more months.
[46:47.23]I'm going.
[46:48.99]First course of action is top right, I think.
[46:55.21]Middle right.
[46:55.73]We're taking this.
[46:57.23]Let's go.
[47:02.22]I'm not fucking... I don't care if I lose my capital.
[47:04.04]I'll get one.
[47:10.65]Top right?
[47:11.29]I mean, that's where we're going.
[47:20.26]Right here.
[47:22.46]I'll take this.
[47:29.58]We're in Orange's world?
[47:30.84]Yeah.
[47:40.50]We are in an orange world.
[47:42.02]And then I'm going in this thing.
[47:44.38]And wherever that ends up, whatever.
[47:45.82]Here comes a battle.
[47:53.16]There he goes.
[47:54.04]Just waiting for me to leave.
[47:55.22]Purple's dead.
[47:57.53]That was very anticlimactic.
[48:05.71]Purple, I think, officially is dead.
[48:08.27]They don't have anything.
[48:10.17]You have one hero, I think, right?
[48:13.85]That's all you got.
[48:17.47]This dumb motherfucker still has default skeletons.
[48:22.37]I hate this guy.
[48:30.28]Might as well go with the fight here.
[48:31.56]It doesn't matter.
[48:33.92]I'm gonna get your castle anyways.
[48:40.33]Purple did more than you.
[48:41.19]No, he didn't.
[48:41.53]No, he didn't.
[48:44.39]Alright, well you don't even have... What's... Earthquake.
[48:46.25]This!
[48:47.37]Earthquake.
[48:49.07]Do I have Earthquake?
[48:51.95]We're getting Meteor Shower.
[48:54.57]Sacrifice.
[48:55.23]Armageddon.
[48:56.51]Clone.
[48:58.07]No, what are we gonna do?
[48:59.61]Fucking... Meteor Shower.
[49:03.00]Right here.
[49:05.02]Right here?
[49:05.40]Right in the middle?
[49:06.14]I think so.
[49:08.68]Three people with it.
[49:10.60]Oh, boy.
[49:12.58]You get stronger every day.
[49:20.08]Come on out here.
[49:26.70]One hit.
[49:29.80]Let's go right here.
[49:35.88]Is that open yet?
[49:40.25]This is open, right?
[49:41.13]Or opening?
[49:42.35]I can't go into the moat.
[49:48.37]Thank you for coming out.
[49:51.13]Easy.
[49:55.23]He's a casual.
[50:00.16]He's expecting the AI to carry him.
[50:01.78]No, I'm expecting the AI to... Get out of the backpack that's on my back.
[50:08.34]Just weighing me down.
[50:13.80]He curled up into a ball, and he's just in my suitcase.
[50:19.35]Let's get in here.
[50:24.73]Done deal.
[50:26.97]Castle's mine.
[50:29.99]And then... Okay, that's it.
[50:30.97]I'm gonna get his artifact.
[50:33.77]Ooh, fuck.
[50:35.33]Ballistics.
[50:37.13]Two aim shots at max damage, or... Rearrange troops.
[50:40.45]Two aim shots.
[50:42.29]Mine.
[50:45.12]Okay.
[50:46.76]Good.
[50:49.80]Now it begins.
[50:53.15]No.
[50:56.93]Top left.
[50:58.21]From... Here we go.
[51:08.02]Okay, I don't think I can take this.
[51:10.10]Yes, I can.
[51:12.04]Oh, fuck yeah.
[51:12.68]I'm gonna take them both.
[51:14.44]Pack, pack, few, pack.
[51:20.68]Defend the capital?
[51:21.30]I don't... I don't even need to defend the capital.
[51:26.38]It doesn't matter.
[51:26.88]They're dead anyways.
[51:35.90]Pack, pack, few, pack, pack, pack.
[51:39.28]Just fly.
[51:39.96]Just cause damage.
[51:46.42]I'm back.
[51:46.72]Is purple still alive?
[51:47.86]Yes.
[51:50.32]But not for long.
[51:55.57]You need multiple heroes.
[51:58.91]Yeah, I... I know.
[52:01.11]It's just... It's too late for that.
[52:02.89]I have really nothing.
[52:10.66]I thought I had multiple heroes when I had a friend of mine playing.
[52:14.88]I didn't mean to gag myself.
[52:16.68]This guy doesn't do anything.
[52:30.01]You might as well just be the chef.
[52:41.29]Kill the dragon.
[52:42.03]At least kill one of these dragons.
[52:43.44]You can do it.
[52:45.08]You're so bad.
[52:45.86]Worst unit in the game.
[52:57.52]He's getting toxic.
[53:00.26]It's not even good.
[53:00.88]It's a bad unit.
[53:01.42]It's not even a good unit.
[53:02.00]You know, it's the starting... I was the wrong character to start with.
[53:10.72]Like, this player's not even good.
[53:12.30]This guy's not even good.
[53:13.10]Like, I just picked the wrong starting hero.
[53:16.51]This guy's not even good.
[53:17.19]It's, like, really annoying, you know?
[53:21.78]I should have fucking won.
[53:23.58]Like, I picked the wrong fucking hero in the beginning.
[53:24.92]This guy's not even good at the game.
[53:36.73]You don't have a friend like that, that you play games with, or you played games with, and every time that they died, it was always like... No, this game's, like, bad.
[53:44.21]It's like, I'm not... That guy's bad.
[53:51.70]I am that friend.
[53:53.22]Alright, here we go.
[53:55.54]Let's go!
[53:56.06]I need music for this.
[54:00.72]Good music.
[54:01.26]Hold on, I gotta get pumped up.
[54:09.05]No, not Doom.
[54:09.71]It's gotta be like epic fantasy music.
[54:20.22]I love Benny Hill.
[54:31.57]Does this have a song?
[54:33.37]It does have a song, doesn't it?
[54:35.54]Alright, I'm going to be quiet and you're going to be able to watch the epic battle, okay?
[54:40.61]Just pretend you're watching a movie.
[55:07.65]Thank you.
[55:56.99]Where's that guy from?
[55:58.83]Was that guy in the last movie?
[56:02.91]What's that guy's name?
[56:48.34]Hello?
[56:51.28]No, I'm gonna move now.
[56:53.76]Yeah, it's like this fantasy movie.
[56:55.32]It sucks.
[56:55.84]Put that phone down!
[56:59.80]Come on, I'll call you back.
[57:10.45]Dickhead.
[57:12.35]You threw fucking popcorn at me, motherfucker?
[57:15.24]What are you gonna do?
[57:16.82]Sit the fuck down.
[57:18.46]Get the fuck out of here, you fucking idiot.
[57:22.06]Somebody get security!
[57:36.85]Don't do it!
[57:41.53]Get him out of here!
[57:43.21]Get him out of my fucking mouth!
[57:44.23]He hit me right in the fucking mouth!
[57:47.01]Piece of shit, threw a fucking whole bag of popcorn at my fucking friend.
[57:51.64]No, I don't want you to take my name.
[57:53.50]I don't want you to take my fucking name.
[57:54.64]No, you don't need my name.
[58:01.20]This is like the best part of the movie.
[58:07.89]I won.
[58:12.87]I did it!
[58:13.31]Alright, I'll get my stream not claimed, please.
[58:27.68]I didn't even lose anybody either, let's go!
[58:39.32]Have you ever had a girlfriend?
[58:41.06]Yeah, I got one right now!
[58:43.22]We're in IP's camp!
[58:47.14]Is there an after-credits scene?
[58:52.00]Where am I?
[58:52.42]Uh-oh, he's coming for the house.
[58:59.98]We've rested up.
[59:01.52]Any replacements?
[59:05.28]I think we can go down.
[59:10.32]Unbelievable.
[59:11.09]Unbelievable.
[59:11.89]Unbelievable.
[59:17.05]I have a girlfriend, but she goes to another school.
[59:19.01]I mean, that's a classic.
[59:28.14]Just, I want you to keep in mind something very important.
[59:30.26]Just look at this.
[59:31.60]Where was that?
[59:32.36]Was it down here?
[59:33.98]You need to see this.
[59:34.60]This is fucking so important.
[59:35.90]I'm about to throw a bag of popcorn.
[59:39.59]Where is he?
[59:41.83]He, this purple is just standing.
[59:43.85]And they walked by him.
[59:47.16]Where is he?
[59:56.46]There he is.
[59:59.47]Red walked by him.
[60:02.37]He doesn't have a... Isn't it like seven days and you automatically die of starvation?
[60:11.08]Why is he still alive?
[60:30.55]I can't understand your unintelligible Boston accent.
[60:33.08]Speak more clearly.
[60:34.08]The fuck are you talking about?
[60:41.10]It's another castle.
[60:42.98]Oh, what's that?
[60:43.74]I'll take another one, please.
[60:51.85]What is this music?
[61:15.28]Oh, it's the castle.
[61:28.54]Turn off teleporters if you do another game.
[61:30.78]Yeah.
[61:34.18]This was the random map.
[61:38.44]Everything random.
[61:40.44]Test.
[61:40.78]So.
[61:43.98]It's cool.
[61:44.50]I would actually probably rather play one of the scenarios.
[61:46.58]Just because, remember when we first started this?
[61:49.03]There was random shit everywhere.
[61:50.95]Almost like as if it wasn't supposed to be where it was.
[61:55.07]Well, here we go.
[61:57.35]Another movie.
[61:58.58]Do I get punched in the face in this movie, too?
[62:11.48]we go I fixed it okay oh I'm thinking we got eight versus nine same dragon but not anymore let's kill those vampires I feel like I kind of just get in here but this is my strongest unit I don't know what to do
[62:37.14]I don't know what to do.
[62:38.65]I have no idea.
[62:39.49]I have absolutely no idea.
[62:40.47]I have no idea what to do.
[62:45.73]I could go in to get the first hit.
[62:49.36]Going in.
[62:50.80]Fuck it.
[62:56.92]Get in.
[62:57.50]Everybody get in.
[63:10.11]Is my microphone?
[63:10.92]No, it's not.
[63:20.45]Save the dragons, please, God.
[63:22.03]No, the dragons can't be saved.
[63:33.47]I'm trying to keep the vampires alive.
[63:34.79]Those are the ones that I think actually really matter here.
[63:38.08]Ah, that hurts.
[63:47.52]Sorrow?
[63:49.41]Stone skin?
[63:51.83]Bloodlust?
[63:56.03]I think so.
[64:02.40]Save him.
[64:02.72]You're a heartless owner.
[64:05.42]He's going to be fine.
[64:06.66]I need him to take hits and be able to take out the dragons.
[64:11.98]He's doing very, very good.
[64:13.10]Okay, angel.
[64:17.34]Angel's going to die here.
[64:20.55]No, that means like a super crit.
[64:24.63]Okay, I had to get rid of them first.
[64:27.15]Can I make it in here?
[64:28.09]I don't think I can.
[64:30.58]I can't really get over that.
[64:31.40]Can I walk over this?
[64:32.16]It's not that happy.
[64:38.82]She's dead!
[64:39.29]Nice.
[64:49.81]I've noticed people have blood that I can steal.
[65:01.67]This is game over.
[65:03.83]The vampires can't drain any light because there's no light to drain.
[65:14.59]No, not yet.
[65:16.47]It's not a lost, complete lost cause yet.
[65:29.29]Get in!
[65:30.07]Get inside!
[65:33.43]That's f***ing unbelievable.
[65:34.66]Alright, um... Clone.
[65:39.42]Frost Ring.
[65:40.26]Anti-magic.
[65:42.04]I'm thinking, what's Death Ripple?
[65:43.62]Sends a wave of death across the battlefield, which damage is all non-undead.
[65:45.76]Everyone's undead here.
[65:48.02]Ice Bolt.
[65:50.02]Onto them.
[65:53.97]Decent.
[65:54.81]That's decent.
[66:01.45]I'm gonna beat it.
[66:02.61]I'm gonna do it, right?
[66:03.73]Yeah, I am.
[66:04.83]But what did it cost?
[66:11.49]What did it cost?
[66:16.52]But he already had blood.
[66:25.71]I just ripped my shirt way more than it was.
[66:29.05]This is ridiculous now.
[66:30.63]Now this has to go into, like, the garbage.
[66:33.38]Did you guys hear that?
[66:40.58]This is now, like, a piece of spaghetti around my neck.
[66:44.50]No!
[66:45.74]And really, I can't, like, save it either.
[66:47.52]I just, like, grabbed it like a fucking idiot.
[67:03.45]No, I have to like... I have to sti- But if I stitch it together, the fibers are gonna be all screwed up.
[67:15.85]Is this a premium?
[67:16.83]No!
[67:17.17]This is not a premium.
[67:18.88]This is not a... $20 premium t-shirt that you can get from the Jerma985 Teespring store.
[67:24.70]$20 for a premium shirt.
[67:25.86]This is just a Hanes.
[67:47.11]Killed the dragon.
[67:48.61]Oops.
[67:51.67]It doesn't matter.
[67:52.65]I'm not gonna win this.
[67:54.97]I'm gonna win this match, but I'm not gonna... Look at the fucking units I have left.
[68:02.37]It doesn't matter.
[68:03.21]It's fine.
[68:06.47]Like, there we go.
[68:07.35]I got 12,000 experience.
[68:14.36]Basic learning.
[68:15.18]Basic air.
[68:16.84]Hey, I did it!
[68:18.92]This is my original home!
[68:21.76]I have five vampires.
[68:23.22]I took my home back, that's all I care about.
[68:28.80]And I'm gonna go take this one too.
[68:37.90]Did you make ads for the Teespring so that you can play it when chat asks for ads?
[68:41.74]Yeah, that's true.
[68:46.30]Every time you guys ask for an ad, I'm just gonna tell you about my t-shirts.
[68:50.10]Holy shit.
[68:51.14]37 of these.
[68:51.56]This is the real end here.
[68:56.50]That's... too many.
[69:03.75]Is this the same castle?
[69:10.17]They'll never take me alive!
[69:12.93]I'll blow this place to kingdom come before I go with you!
[69:16.35]What is that?
[69:43.28]I gotta do my last... I'm still standing.
[69:47.98]And everyone's watching.
[69:49.95]They have the respect and they have the dignity to let me, at my own dignity and my own free will, go out of the castle and have my final stand.
[70:17.25]Purple lived.
[70:21.19]Purple lived without a house, just walking around.
[70:23.09]That's the third time I've lost my fucking head.
[70:29.29]I wanna see stats from that game.
[70:30.75]Show me stats.
[70:33.29]I wanna see the after the game scores.
[70:40.23]Oh well.
[70:43.62]Bad military leader.
[70:44.94]Yeah, it's alright though.
[70:50.47]Go to the autosave and look at the tavern.
[70:52.09]What do you mean?
[70:53.47]Uh, no, back, back, back.
[70:58.11]Autosave and look at the tavern.
[71:00.88]The tavern where?
[71:01.56]Uh, what about it?
[71:16.86]Oh, you're talking about here.
[71:20.65]Yeah, he didn't do anything.
[71:24.05]He got the most wood.
[71:29.78]I was number of towns, goal, I was up here.
[71:32.08]I would have been up here.
[71:33.56]He just collected resources and sent them to me sometimes in the mail.
[71:43.38]Yeah, I don't have the best hero because my hero's dead.
[71:45.30]He just died.
[71:50.14]See, the game doesn't even think that I have a 10, 3, 6, 9 hero.
[71:53.43]How am I doing triple time?
[72:05.43]Second place against the AI.
[72:06.84]Yeah, this deck is a hard game.
[72:11.56]It's a hard game.
[72:16.84]Make more than one hero.
[72:18.60]I had like three or four heroes in the first like four hours of this campaign.
[72:23.44]I did.
[72:25.06]Purple just was in a fucking luggage and I was storing them overhead all day.
[72:36.09]I need to worry about my own luggage.
[72:40.07]Streamer eats four gyros?
[72:45.77]Oh god.
[72:48.46]It's not a real Heroes of Might and Magic 3 stream.
[72:50.74]It's not 8 hours.
[72:51.89]No, I can't do that today.
[72:55.21]We're coming back slow.
[73:06.66]Here we go.
[73:08.16]He's gonna say it.
[73:09.90]He's about to say it.
[73:11.68]He's about to say it.
[73:13.26]No, no, no, don't say it.
[73:14.28]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[73:15.51]Don't do it.
[73:17.95]Guys, that's gonna be the end.
[73:26.44]I paused the stream.
[73:28.76]Did he say, did he say it?
[73:30.20]Did he?
[73:33.78]I paused it.
[73:34.22]I'm gonna unpause.
[73:39.58]I hope he doesn't say it.
[73:43.33]End of the stream.
[73:46.31]No!
[73:58.16]He did it!
[74:01.88]Don't do that!
[74:04.32]Nah, yeah, I'm... I need to ease back into this.
[74:07.93]I've already been... I was supposed to take it easy today, and I, like, was screaming and yelling.
[74:12.81]I just can't have a fucking... I can't have, like, a calm stream.
[74:18.47]I just can't.
[74:20.42]I don't know what it is.
[74:21.40]Every time I say, oh, I'm gonna play Shaman Vax for an episode, I always end up screaming.
[74:31.87]Is there a way that I can just like not get high energy?
[74:34.83]I'm just going to eat like a bunch of pasta before my next comfy stream.
[74:41.66]So I don't like do make any noises.
[74:50.10]Get a lobotomy.
[74:51.37]Whoa.
[74:53.71]No, I'm kidding around.
[74:54.61]But for real, uh,
[74:57.40]Colonoscopy went well.
[74:59.12]We cleaned up some stuff.
[75:00.11]I just kind of want to have a chill day today and scream and make noises and be very loud and scream some more.
[75:06.07]Tomorrow is Cooking Simulator.
[75:08.49]That's going to be a fun one.
[75:09.97]I can't wait.
[75:10.49]I've been really looking forward to it.
[75:19.74]Hope you enjoy it.
[75:21.10]Tomorrow, regular time.
[75:25.69]Same place, same network.
[75:30.73]Thank you, everybody, for watching.
[75:34.01]He hates it.
[75:34.63]No, no.
[75:35.31]Have you seen the trailer?
[75:37.27]It looks very detailed and very fun.
[75:40.18]It's like House Flipper, but only in the kitchen.
[75:45.16]And you only cook food.
[75:47.02]It's very detailed.
[75:50.06]I think you're going to like it.
[75:52.06]But take care of yourselves.
[75:53.24]We're gonna do the bits and everything.
[75:55.12]Not quite ready to leave.
[75:57.88]It's not like House Flipper at all.
[75:59.08]Well, I'm just saying it's one of those like simulation kind of... You'll see.
[76:04.68]You'll see.
[76:05.00]That's what we're gonna call it.
[76:13.71]Why is Sam and Mac still up?
[76:16.35]That was incorrect.
[76:18.45]But let's do the bits and the subs.
[76:21.68]If you've taken off, hopefully we see you soon, maybe tomorrow or the next day.
[76:25.78]Normal time tomorrow, yeah, between 3 and 4 Pacific.
[76:29.68]Hopefully see you there.
[76:32.66]So let us rewind five hours to the beginning of the stream.
[76:37.40]Let's go over some of these bits, what do you say?
[76:41.47]Am I going to play Layers of Fear 2?
[76:42.95]I don't know.
[76:43.61]I really don't know.
[76:50.65]I've seen such wild, mixed things about it.
[76:55.13]I've heard it's really awful, and not in like a fun, funny way, just not fun and not good at all.
[77:01.69]And then I've heard, no, it's actually pretty great.
[77:05.14]It's so mixed, I don't even know what I want to do.
[77:12.28]But it seems like it doesn't really have great response so far.
[77:19.86]What are we talking about?
[77:20.56]Uh, Layers of Fear 2.
[77:25.48]He hates it.
[77:27.81]Hey, thank you to, uh, Atrolux A-Trucks for the 250.
[77:32.39]They say Pride 100, Pride 100, Pride 50.
[77:36.37]We fucking love you, Jerma.
[77:37.43]Those new meds.
[77:39.93]Huh.
[77:40.81]You can do this.
[77:42.31]P.S.
[77:42.67]Happy Pride Month.
[77:44.51]Happy Pride Month.
[77:47.46]Uh, those new meds.
[77:49.64]We fucking love you, Jerma.
[77:50.54]Those new meds.
[77:53.50]I did get new medication for my... I was gonna say my bum, but that's what it is.
[77:59.54]What, am I gonna pretend that's not what it is?
[78:00.92]Uh, it is a little weird.
[78:06.36]I'm trying to get used to it.
[78:12.22]But, we'll see.
[78:13.90]Thank you so much for the $2.50.
[78:14.56]Really appreciate it.
[78:18.39]Yes.
[78:18.47]My mother had a great time here.
[78:19.49]When she was here last month.
[78:45.80]It was a great time.
[78:46.32]It was great to see my mother.
[78:47.70]She's wonderful.
[78:50.28]And hopefully I see her again soon.
[78:54.13]And yeah, the colonoscopy, it went well.
[78:56.31]From my understanding, there's still tissue that's being examined.
[78:59.33]I have to wait a few weeks.
[79:01.49]That's how long it takes for biopsies to come back.
[79:04.44]But I was told that there are no major concerns.
[79:08.44]But in a few weeks, I will know for sure.
[79:11.20]So.
[79:12.88]There's some tissue still being examined.
[79:17.48]Colin Torr.
[79:19.96]It's just a long tube.
[79:22.10]Am I going to stream E3?
[79:23.12]Yes.
[79:24.19]I'm going to do the same thing that I did last year and do the major conferences.
[79:31.41]So you can expect that.
[79:32.29]Absolutely.
[79:35.61]But thank you, Marbush Magali.
[79:36.73]Thank you, Daff Skeletor for the $15.
[79:38.79]There's no message here but $15.
[79:40.32]There's a large drop of money.
[79:44.00]Thank you.
[79:46.54]Appreciate the $15.
[79:50.17]Thank you so much.
[79:54.99]What were the minor concerns?
[79:57.47]I mean, I have irritable bowel disease.
[80:00.19]I've had, like, colitis for 15 years almost.
[80:02.73]12 years at this point.
[80:04.73]Since I was, like, 24?
[80:06.25]23?
[80:06.85]Been almost, like... No, it's been, like, 10 years.
[80:11.10]Something like that.
[80:14.84]So, I still have those problems.
[80:21.45]It's just I've never had a full colonoscopy before.
[80:24.96]I've had sigmoidoscopies.
[80:28.78]Which is the same thing, except they don't go as far in.
[80:35.38]So yeah, there's IBS and there's IBD.
[80:38.72]IBS is Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
[80:41.16]IBD is Irritable Bowel Disease.
[80:43.70]I will have it for the rest of my life.
[80:45.20]You cannot get rid of it.
[80:45.94]So.
[80:48.76]That's just the way it is.
[80:50.71]So I have to be a lot more conscious of my intestinal and gastro health.
[80:59.25]So that's why a lot of people were asking.
[81:00.63]I know we talked about this in the beginning of the stream, but some of you may not have been here.
[81:04.79]I have to be screened earlier just because of all the gastro issues that I do have so and I was having a couple of symptoms that I didn't really have an explanation for so we went down the path of just getting it done now there you go but thank you for the 15 daf skeletor thank you c4g for the five dollars
[81:31.55]No, that's too- I can't play those games in front of people.
[81:40.05]Because I make, like, decisions that are so bad, probably, and aren't, like, completely correct.
[81:45.11]And everyone would just make fun of me.
[81:47.05]You try to tell me that if I, like, had Lethal, I missed it?
[81:50.49]The chat wouldn't be like making tons of fun of me and stuff.
[81:56.12]No, I know that I don't know how to play well.
[81:59.04]I don't want to be told that.
[82:00.64]I already know it.
[82:05.52]I do everything so incorrectly that you guys would send me to the guillotine if I streamed that game.
[82:18.08]Talking about Hearthstone.
[82:23.14]Not only do I miss lethal, but sometimes I do wrong trades.
[82:26.82]And then I go, oops, oh, it's okay.
[82:29.05]I'll just do the spell to him next time.
[82:32.17]And it's completely incorrect, but it still works.
[82:40.75]I'm the kind of person that does, like, the deal two damage to an enemy to the hero's face.
[82:47.35]I do that sometimes.
[82:49.67]People are not going to be happy about that if I do that on stream.
[82:55.88]I'm the guy that you go up against in Chicken League, Rank 25, that the first thing he does is do the 2 damage Hunter spell that costs, what, 1 mana, to your face, and you know immediately you're going to win.
[83:12.27]Yeah, Arcane Shot.
[83:13.63]I'm the guy that does the Arcane Shot to you turn 1, to your face.
[83:17.70]And you are guaranteed to win that game.
[83:21.06]So, that's why I can't stream.
[83:25.63]But thank you.
[83:26.35]I appreciate the enthusiasm nonetheless.
[83:31.44]Thank you, C4G.
[83:31.96]Hey, trust no one.
[83:35.62]Thanks for the $2.50.
[83:36.80]December 2018, you announced green screen encore.
[83:41.22]That was a long time ago.
[83:42.30]Right after that, I got lots of inspiration to produce 10 videos.
[83:46.44]It's summer already.
[83:47.38]Jerma lied again.
[83:51.39]But I still want to share my works with you.
[83:54.49]Maybe watch them before next stream.
[83:57.10]Want to bring fun to chat fellas.
[83:58.76]Or now.
[83:59.24]It's always up to you, daddy.
[84:00.52]Much love.
[84:04.44]Alright, you ready?
[84:06.06]You ready for this?
[84:06.60]You ready?
[84:08.05]You have to hold me to this date.
[84:10.35]Are you ready?
[84:11.81]Are you ready for this?
[84:12.67]Because I'm going to make a date.
[84:13.65]I'm going to give you a date here.
[84:14.77]And, like, we have to do it.
[84:21.46]It is June 4th.
[84:25.50]2019.
[84:32.86]We are going to do a watch the video stream.
[84:39.78]On.
[84:43.04]June.
[84:43.52]29th.
[84:54.98]June 29th.
[84:55.92]I want to give people time to get them ready.
[85:08.68]June 29th of 2019.
[85:12.66]Can't be this week, can't be next week.
[85:14.10]I got like the E3 stuff is this weekend.
[85:17.11]I've got these like unlock escape the room card things that I want to do on cam.
[85:24.76]then like the the week of the like the 17th I've got something now you can clip it don't let me forget and I will give you some details about that I want to give like a couple weeks so I can get the some of the mods involved so we can actually set up something uh like last time
[85:52.25]This is not a re-watching of... This would be new videos.
[85:54.91]Videos that were not on the last stream.
[85:58.31]And I may even... If we... I don't know.
[86:02.27]Maybe we just turn... Maybe we'll just turn it into like... I don't know.
[86:08.55]Let me think about this.
[86:09.71]Let me think about this.
[86:10.75]Because... I've got some ideas.
[86:17.37]They might not all have to be green screen videos.
[86:23.30]You know what I'm saying?
[86:25.60]Maybe we could do something here.
[86:26.82]Because people make lots of great videos that aren't necessarily only about green screen stuff.
[86:39.88]I mean, obviously, they'd have to follow some criteria where it'd have to do with the channel.
[86:43.86]Like, you could... Don't just, like, send me, like, a video of, like, Shrek playing, like, the flute or something.
[86:50.88]Like, what that means... What does that have to do with anything?
[86:57.07]Well, I'll figure that out.
[86:58.25]I'll start talking to some of the mods about it.
[87:00.99]June 29th will be the day we do it.
[87:04.33]Arrest that guy.
[87:09.08]Now it has to happen.
[87:09.80]There you go.
[87:12.34]And we could turn... We could make it... We might be able to make it interesting, too.
[87:17.03]Not that the last one wasn't interesting, but... Maybe add a couple of things.
[87:21.17]Maybe put some incentives.
[87:23.31]Maybe do, like, a charity thing?
[87:25.35]I don't know.
[87:25.87]Maybe.
[87:26.19]Let me just explore this.
[87:29.92]I'll explore this for a little bit.
[87:35.92]Twenty-nine.
[87:40.61]Guest stars.
[87:41.45]We'll see.
[87:44.95]But I have not forgotten.
[87:46.22]It's just... Kind of a lot of random shit has happened.
[87:51.12]A bunch of people have visited here.
[87:52.86]I've had, like, friends and family and... Medical.
[87:56.10]Like, there's just been things that have been happening that I just can't really focus on.
[87:59.30]Any of the projects that I want to focus on immediately.
[88:05.55]There's been a lot of just, like, guests.
[88:08.01]Strangely enough.
[88:09.43]Some unexpected...
[88:11.72]But, yeah, it's... That's just the way it is.
[88:15.90]We're gonna push forward.
[88:17.44]But thank you, TrustNoOne.
[88:18.98]Look forward to seeing your videos.
[88:22.85]Hey, CornFlex, thanks for the $15, CornFlex.
[88:26.55]Hey, Jerma, just quit my job and I feel fly, but I hope you're doing good.
[88:29.75]Here's a bit of snack money.
[88:30.79]Keep doing you.
[88:31.37]I will buy snacks with those.
[88:33.63]I will buy $15 worth of snacks, I promise.
[88:40.18]Uh, quit your job.
[88:41.29]Hopefully, uh, you can figure out what to do next.
[88:48.65]Wish you the best of luck.
[88:49.39]What do you mean I'm not gonna buy snacks with that?
[88:54.34]Guys, like 45% of my whole income goes to snacks.
[88:59.84]Like, this is six pantries here.
[89:02.85]I can't stop.
[89:03.39]I eat like two bags of chips every day.
[89:08.48]I can't stop.
[89:10.20]I eat a loaf of bread every fucking morning.
[89:15.19]I just soak the bread in water.
[89:17.15]And then like... I do not do that.
[89:26.43]But thank you for the $15 cornflakes.
[89:29.59]I'm doing pretty good.
[89:30.67]Thank you for the snack money.
[89:33.77]Aftersmath.
[89:35.00]Aftersmath.
[89:35.94]Thanks for the three bucks.
[89:37.93]I love everything you do.
[89:38.71]You're my favorite content creator by far.
[89:40.29]Haven't caught a stream in a while because of emotional problems.
[89:43.22]So I'm glad to see nothing's changed.
[89:45.04]Here's all the rest of my bits because you deserve it.
[89:46.98]I also wanted to ask you, are you going to stream Cyberpunk 2077?
[89:49.64]Okay, well soon.
[89:53.20]Yes.
[89:55.36]I feel like you have to.
[89:58.15]That game is... just looks like it's so full of stuff to do.
[90:04.74]Whenever that comes out, whatever the criteria is for its release, I feel like everyone... There's going to be a day on Twitch where, when you go to the Browse by Game category, there's probably going to be like six games on that list.
[90:22.65]And there'll be like fucking 40,000 people streaming, 27-7.
[90:27.70]And then like Hearthstone, League of Legends, and CSGO.
[90:36.46]Everyone's gonna play this game, so I'll be one of them 2077 yeah 2077 2077 Normie come on Nope normie stream
[91:04.80]what like we just we just played like heroes of might and magic 3. why is Cyberpunk 2077 what are you talking about heroes of white magic is so normie what do you mean what does that even mean what does that even mean that's pretty normal
[91:39.34]Heroes of Might and Magic is the most played game of all time.
[91:42.06]Oh yeah?
[91:43.02]How many hours do you guys have in it?
[91:50.35]I bet I see a lot of zeros.
[91:59.16]Two because it blue screens my computer.
[92:00.92]I'm sorry to hear that.
[92:01.66]That's not cool.
[92:03.34]Zero because I'm not a normie.
[92:10.53]I feel like if you guys watched me eat, like, Frosted Flakes, that'd be like a normie cereal, right?
[92:19.57]What is not a normie cereal?
[92:21.87]What is not normie in, like, the cereal world?
[92:28.30]Fruit Loops?
[92:28.80]Nah, that's normie.
[92:29.98]Raisin Bran?
[92:30.50]That's normie.
[92:32.42]Nothing.
[92:33.74]Everything is normie.
[92:34.90]Don't you understand?
[92:38.50]Honey bunches of oats?
[92:40.18]That's not- what are you talking about?
[92:41.99]That's very normal.
[92:47.55]Apple jacks are for chads.
[92:53.06]Apple- what?
[92:55.92]Honey bunches of oats.
[92:58.90]No.
[93:00.70]Bacon flakes?
[93:03.40]Cookie crisps?
[93:04.09]Nah, that's bullshit.
[93:05.84]Cookie Crisp before the recipe change, maybe I would agree with you.
[93:09.80]But they changed that recipe, it doesn't taste the same.
[93:21.82]Fruity Pebbles?
[93:23.36]No, I don't- I disagree.
[93:25.76]Fruity Pebbles, you pour the milk in, and before you put the spoon in to bite into the cereal, it turns into wet napkins.
[93:37.50]I disagree Count Chocula now that I can get behind I can get behind that Anyways, what?
[94:05.14]I think Pops is a pretty
[94:08.48]I think I can get behind that, too.
[94:10.82]Or, uh, smacks.
[94:15.33]When's the last time you had smacks?
[94:17.69]That's what it's called, right?
[94:19.61]With the frog?
[94:25.00]Yeah, honey smacks.
[94:25.76]Honey smacks.
[94:26.76]Those were awesome.
[94:30.94]I can get behind those.
[94:33.55]Those are the ones that look like coffee beans.
[94:36.35]They were little coffee beans.
[94:38.75]Puffed up.
[94:40.13]I might just go buy some.
[94:42.93]I'm just going to prove how much of a nod of a normie I am.
[94:45.17]I'm going to just eat honey smacks.
[94:48.21]What are you linking me here?
[94:53.29]What if we kissed?
[94:55.11]I don't even know what that is.
[95:00.65]Cereal unboxing.
[95:01.63]Alright, let's keep going.
[95:06.29]Thank you, Dr. Lownote, for the $5.

[95:39.33]Dorkcube7000, thanks for the 250.
[95:41.33]Now, when you went to get your colonoscopy, you made sure to show the doc your Firewatch photos, right?
[95:46.57]Uh, Doctor didn't need to see Firewatch photos.
[95:54.13]He saw way more than that.
[96:00.55]Firewatch photos don't even compare to the images.
[96:05.27]I have these images, by the way.
[96:08.91]I was thinking about... They give them to you.
[96:13.91]It's a bunch of images.
[96:16.86]But I don't think I can show them.
[96:20.56]I'm fairly certain that that's like... I don't know.
[96:22.60]I think that might break TOS.
[96:27.46]Autograph them.
[96:32.73]Post them on Twitter.
[96:33.63]I can't do that.
[96:35.45]Can't you get it?
[96:36.11]I can't do that.
[96:38.73]Autograph the no it's like bad this like inflammation and stuff you don't want to see these But I already have new fire watch photos that the doctor took for me up my ass That's the fucking like comedy there
[97:03.34]Put him on Discord.
[97:04.62]No, I'm not gonna like- I'm not gonna like fucking sign and show and sell my colonoscopy photos.
[97:18.55]That's like... fucking apocalyptic like dystopian world.
[97:25.53]Me selling photos of my colonoscopy, me signing and sending them to people.
[97:39.43]Welcome to 2020.

[98:06.76]Dr. Oz did it and he's a doctor.
[98:08.70]Dr. Oz also had a fucking TV show where he was a doctor on TV.
[98:13.24]I'm not a fucking doctor on stream.
[98:19.62]I'm not Dr. Oz.
[98:21.62]I don't go on TV and talk about my stuff.
[98:25.00]Let me tell you something.
[98:27.18]I went to the store and I got some lentils.
[98:32.41]I do a pretty good doctor, don't I?
[98:36.29]That's what he talks like.
[98:41.22]That's what he talks like.
[98:43.80]Why are you comparing me to Dr. Oz?
[98:53.29]That wasn't Bernie.
[98:54.31]That was Dr. Oz.
[98:58.19]Hello, everybody, and welcome to the Dr. Oz Show.

[100:20.22]Give me a break.
[100:28.46]update my Facebook no I'm gonna delete that Facebook I'm gonna push the red button on that thing Facebook what's the next big thing that's gonna come along is it TikTok I feel like that already happened did TikTok take our children away from Facebook
[101:00.38]Or is it Discord that took our children away from Facebook?
[101:05.54]What's the second internet?
[101:13.80]I missed TikTok's birth and death.
[101:21.74]When I first started TikTok, I thought TikTok was Vine.
[101:25.95]But then I was shown videos of what TikTok is, and it's people lip-syncing for like eight seconds.
[101:34.10]And that's it.
[101:41.12]It's like Vine, but you lip-sync for like eight seconds.
[101:50.72]It's a shittier Vine for Gen Z. It's evil Vine.
[102:01.82]Evil, evil Vine.
[102:07.07]Why does that sound so funny?
[102:11.31]Vine was GenZoomer, though.
[102:13.21]Well, why did they need another one?
[102:15.09]Oh, it's because they deleted Vine.
[102:17.77]That's right.
[102:19.25]They deleted Vine, and then Vine, then TikTok took all the Vine kids, right?
[102:26.54]Oh, fuck.
[102:31.90]All I remember from TikTok is people sending me videos of everybody having, like, vampire teeth.
[102:40.37]I swear, I think I have been shown 10 or 12 TikTok videos, and I think 8 of them, they had vampire teeth.
[102:53.26]I'm just telling you just anecdotal things.
[103:08.80]Zoomers can't stay with something for more than a couple of months.
[103:11.20]It's because they're always moving.
[103:19.13]Vampires are normie.
[103:21.91]Their brains are too small.
[103:23.55]What the fuck?
[103:24.97]Why?
[103:25.49]That's not... Hey, wow.
[103:30.84]We found the boomer!
[103:32.06]We found the boomer!
[103:33.72]You guys call me boomer.
[103:35.36]Not zoomers.
[103:36.44]Their brains are all so small.
[103:39.10]All they do is drink fucking Mountain Dew game fuel and floss and watch TikTok.
[103:47.45]Is that what you do?
[103:50.93]Is that what actually happens?
[103:58.79]Kinda.
[104:03.19]No, I'm talking about teeth.
[104:04.83]Like, they floss their teeth.
[104:05.75]Boomers don't floss their teeth.
[104:06.91]Neither do Millennials.
[104:08.51]Zoomers are flossing their teeth.
[104:10.43]That's one thing you gotta remember.
[104:11.53]That's important.
[104:20.26]-2 of me on that.
[104:21.38]That was funny.
[104:26.26]Anyways, thank you, TheYellowist, for the five dollars.
[104:29.08]Thank you, Yellowist.
[104:30.97]Hey Jerma, there was a huge gap around 2016 where I couldn't find you in YouTube and didn't know you made the jump to Twitch.
[104:37.43]So there was a ton of old content I missed, but I found them recently.
[104:41.15]Just the streams in their entirety.
[104:43.27]So I'm gonna get watching.
[104:44.25]P.S.
[104:44.49]your sorcerer streams were amazing.
[104:46.45]You got a lot.
[104:47.88]You got a lot of stuff to watch.
[104:50.28]Because unlike YouTube, which was, you know, 6 to 12 minute videos,

[110:29.63]I bought one of your shirts.
[110:31.63]Thanks for the opportunity to buy one.
[110:33.41]I just wanted to say, after purchasing it, I'm thoroughly impressed.
[110:36.95]Impressed, sorry, I meant depressed.
[110:40.00]I used to be happy.

[111:06.66]$25 from Vilemi.
[111:12.13]Hey, Jerma, now that you're done with the colonoscopy, you can finally get back to chugging Mountain Dew like the gamer god that you are.
[111:17.35]Here's some bits so you can stock up on that gamer brew I know you're craving.
[111:25.92]No, I'm not gonna drink that shit.
[111:29.24]Thank you for the $25, Vilemi.
[111:32.92]I mean, technically, I probably could drink it, but I'm not going to.
[111:38.58]Hey, Flying Pixels, thanks for the $15 and 2 cents.
[111:43.46]1502.
[111:45.68]Much love to you in chat.
[111:46.94]Y'all are awesome.
[111:48.38]I agree.
[111:51.14]Thanks for the $15 and... Yeah, we got a pretty good chat here.
[111:57.21]We have some pretty fun people here.
[112:05.65]Uh, Sana Jenova, thanks for the $3.00.
[112:09.08]I know it doesn't really fit with the thematic of the channel, but I made this hypothetical Jerm of room emote.
[112:13.60]Hope you like it.
[112:19.78]It looks like a video game, like, go-kart character.
[112:29.25]He's so cute.
[112:31.29]It's like the baron.
[112:35.13]I really appreciate it.
[112:36.72]Unfortunately, there already is a Jerm of room emote that is going to be coming very soon.
[112:43.40]Thank you so much for that, though.
[112:44.76]It's very cute.
[112:46.66]It's very nice.
[112:47.20]We actually have a lot of things coming.
[112:54.91]Blordow is currently very hard at work, making a lot of new shit.
[112:59.94]There's gonna be, like, five to ten new emotes, there's gonna be a bunch of new music, there's gonna be a bunch of new stuff, some new screens, new animations, it's coming out.
[113:09.75]Bloido is currently in the process of doing it now.
[113:14.03]New music, oh yeah, there's gonna be, like, ten to fifteen new tracks.
[113:17.06]Not making that up, that's real, Jerma did not lie about Bloido making fifteen new music tracks.
[113:23.36]I did just say fifteen, but it's like ten, maybe twelve, maybe.
[113:29.74]It's gonna be good stuff.
[113:32.16]But thank you, Sanjunova.
[113:32.98]That's a very, very cute emote.
[113:36.80]I love the scarf.
[113:41.14]I'm gonna get a Jerm of popcorn.
[113:43.38]Like dog popcorn?
[113:50.81]Let's get the subs on the screen.
[113:55.73]Thank you, everybody, for your subs.
[114:02.59]Here come the credits.
[114:04.91]We were actually, me and Blordow were actually talking about this.
[114:09.07]About how to change the credits a little bit, maybe.
[114:12.59]Make them some, maybe more interesting.
[114:14.73]Change them up.
[114:16.57]So it's not just a scrolling text.
[114:18.91]We might try to do something with it.
[114:22.12]Should be fun.
[114:25.18]See if it's something we can do.
[114:27.28]But these are all the subs and the, wow, there's a lot.
[114:31.60]there's a lot of reason I guess I haven't been around for like four days huh thanks everybody thank you I I know that you know some of you guys only have like a few subscriptions some of you guys only have one sub that you do whether it's like prime or just a regular sub and a lot of you guys have been subbed for a just concurrently for a long long time
[115:04.03]So thank you for choosing me, if you do.
[115:09.51]Thank you.
[115:09.81]Because there are a lot of other people that stream on this platform, so... I'm honored to have the people that sub to this channel sub.
[115:25.31]Thank you.
[115:27.83]We have a couple more bits to do.
[115:28.99]We have $5 from iCane...
[115:34.25]I-Cane Ling.
[115:37.01]I-Cane.
[115:37.79]I'll just call you I-Cane.
[115:38.97]My brain is having trouble.
[115:41.45]Uh, you can propo- I don't want to see spoilers!
[115:43.49]I don't want to see season 3 spoilers for Sam & Max.
[115:51.03]I don't want to see spoilers for Sam & Max season 3!
[116:00.78]They say Max is extremely hot, and if any of you disagree, you're lying to yourself.
[116:09.41]I'm in a... whatever, I'm... I... I... I... I'm just gonna fucking Homer Simpson into the bush.
[116:19.49]Because I don't... I can't... Thank you for the five dollars.
[116:28.54]Dragon breath 75, thanks for the 250.
[116:31.87]Hey Jermo, I wanted to bring up something about what it was like for me on the anesthetic.
[116:35.72]Reminder, I'm the guy that was blabbering your name after my wisdom teeth removal.
[116:39.48]I do remember that video, it was very funny.
[116:41.84]While I was out of it, I swear I had a dual personality experience.
[116:45.16]The voice in my head sounded like me talking normal, and I was yelling at myself to say normal things, but nothing came out right.
[116:51.59]Did you have any experience like that with your colonoscopy?
[116:54.71]No, I was completely... I was completely aware of all the things that I was saying and doing.
[117:00.45]I have had that experience before on a different anesthesia.
[117:05.32]Where before getting the IV, I remember saying to myself, I really hope I don't say anything stupid or funny.
[117:13.79]Don't say anything dumb.
[117:14.77]Don't say anything funny.
[117:15.65]Don't say anything stupid.
[117:17.70]And as I was getting the medicine, I started to kind of go out.
[117:21.68]I said to the person that was administering it, Hey, do people say anything funny on this?
[117:27.94]And they told me to stop talking.
[117:29.24]They were like, stop talking, stop.
[117:32.53]Your brain's weird.
[117:35.63]It does strange things.
[117:37.51]Yeah, I was told to stop.
[117:43.71]I was actually told to shut up by the person that was doing it.
[117:47.55]Because I was just so, I was floating out of existence.
[117:50.55]And the one thing that I thought to say was, hey, do people ever say anything funny on this?
[117:56.15]Because I was over and over again telling my brain not to say anything funny.
[118:00.21]So I was trying to pretend to be completely with it for some reason.
[118:04.86]Like, hey, do people ever say anything funny on this?
[118:06.84]Because I'm not going to say anything funny because I just told myself not to say anything funny.
[118:15.21]It probably came out really fucked up.
[118:16.57]Yeah, it was probably really embarrassing.
[118:18.47]And so was me telling the nurse that this is not my first rodeo when I'm trying to put my shoes on and almost put my head through the drywall.
[118:27.49]Brain altering, brain chemistry altering drugs, hard drugs like that just fucking turn you upside down.
[118:38.21]didn't hear that part I told the story in the beginning of the stream but I remember everything I remember waking up the last thing I remember on my side because you have to lie on your side when they do the colonoscopy and the the guy said hey you're gonna feel like a sting in your arm it's pretty it's normal that's what happens right before and I felt a little sting and then I woke up so
[119:04.59]But when I woke up, I was completely aware.
[119:08.71]It's not like I, oh, I have no idea about anything I said.
[119:13.41]I was completely aware of where I was and what I was saying, but I was still saying fucking dumb shit.
[119:19.77]And the nurse came in and was talking to me and I kept on, I kept on talking about how great of a practice it was and you guys are all pros and you guys are all pros.
[119:30.75]You guys are pros.
[119:31.99]Let me tell you.
[119:33.97]I may have... I don't... I have this weird half memory of saying this.
[119:38.21]I might not have, but maybe I did.
[119:40.15]That I was gonna give, like, a Yelp review?
[119:44.71]Can you even give a Yelp review for a hospital?
[119:49.78]Is that even possible?
[119:56.02]I guess... Yeah, I guess it is.
[119:57.22]For the cafeteria!
[120:02.99]I gave a review for, like, getting, like, surgery.
[120:05.75]And it's, like, the cafeteria in the hospital.
[120:10.24]Everyone there was a pro.
[120:11.44]The colonoscopy was fantastic.
[120:14.42]The doctors were so nice.
[120:15.68]The nurse, when they were doing the IV, and it's like... Uh, dude, how was, like, the... How was the fucking toast?
[120:22.21]What are you talking about?
[120:26.33]But yeah, I almost fell down, like, three times putting my shoes on.
[120:30.76]I was trying so hard to be normal.
[120:32.96]That's the worst part, because you know you're so fucked up, you know you're on hard drugs.
[120:37.69]And you are so desperate to be normal, you're doing- you're trying so hard.
[120:43.13]That you try too hard, and you do something stupid, and then in your brain you go, A normal person wouldn't do what I just did.
[120:49.40]I have to correct this.
[120:51.34]Hey, don't worry, this ain't my first rodeo.
[120:54.26]I have to correct that.
[120:55.58]Normal people don't say that either.
[121:04.76]You completely go over what a normal person does.
[121:11.27]But the thing is, I was, that was not incorrect.
[121:15.43]This ain't my first rodeo.
[121:16.87]I've had two sigmoidoscopies.
[121:20.51]So maybe my brain was saying like, nah, nah, it's fine.
[121:22.89]I've had this done like before.
[121:25.71]Or the nurse probably thought I was talking about how I do drugs all the time.
[121:33.50]Right?
[121:33.86]Like we talked about in the beginning of the stream.
[121:37.36]Sir, sir, sir, please sit down, please.
[121:38.92]No, no, this ain't my first rodeo.
[121:40.20]I do drugs every day.
[121:42.97]Oh.
[121:43.45]Oh.
[121:44.61]Okay.
[121:48.23]Yeah, both of those scenarios work.
[121:53.83]Yeah.
[121:58.86]But yes, Dragon Breath, that is... Drugs are fucking ridiculous.
[122:04.98]I don't do them.
[122:06.70]I don't like doing them.
[122:09.52]Rock Esper, thanks for the $2.50.
[122:11.16]Random question, but I've just been curious.
[122:13.64]Many streams back, you mentioned listening to the Lost Odyssey OST in your car.
[122:18.47]Do you like that game?
[122:19.33]Because it's one of my all-time favorites.
[122:20.77]Also, you're cute.
[122:21.57]Yes, I... I told you.
[122:28.07]Yeah, I did tell that story about how I had some people that I worked with
[122:33.68]There were some acquaintances that were in my car and I was driving people home and stuff and I was playing that and they thought I was fucking crazy.
[122:43.17]Lost Odyssey OST.
[122:46.09]Remember, this is more than- this is like 15 years ago.
[122:52.08]Can you think of anyone in your entire life that would have the Lost Odyssey OST in their car in the CD player?
[123:07.46]Besides me.
[123:09.08]And besides you.
[123:10.88]That's why it was so embarrassing, because it's just, like... I don't know, maybe, like, part of me was trying to seem, like, interesting or something.
[123:18.64]Hey, what music is- what are you gonna put on?
[123:21.30]Oh, put this on, I guess.
[123:23.04]Look at how interesting I am!
[123:25.40]Oh, you're listening to, like, classical music.
[123:27.70]Nah, it's video game music.
[123:31.48]Oh, look at how interesting you are.
[123:33.86]Yeah, I am.
[123:36.71]Maybe part of me, like, thought that was what I was doing?
[123:38.97]I don't know.
[123:43.13]I listen to OST.
[123:43.83]Yeah, well, not... 2019, this is a different time.
[123:47.85]Back in, like... Back in, like, 2003.
[123:49.48]There wasn't, like, Overwatch costumes at the Spirit of Halloween stores.
[123:55.40]You know what I'm saying?
[123:57.98]This is, like, before... This is before games were, like, cool.
[124:01.92]Cool.
[124:08.00]This is back in the day where video games were still kind of like video games.
[124:15.92]What's a PC gaming?
[124:18.30]I've heard of that.
[124:24.23]So like listening to like a video game OST in your car now is like, oh, whatever.
[124:28.39]But 15 years ago, it was kind of like, why are you doing this?
[124:39.91]Back in my day, we had Pajama.
[124:43.08]No, 15.
[124:43.84]Not 50.
[124:45.02]15.
[124:49.44]But did you... Oh yeah, let me answer the question.
[124:50.90]Did you like the game?
[124:51.72]Oh yeah, I did.
[124:54.85]I liked the combat system in that game.
[124:56.51]I thought it was engaging.
[124:58.79]It wasn't just... Put cursor on this person and let them get hit.
[125:05.04]I liked the timed hits.
[125:07.77]I'm a huge fan of Super Mario RPG, and in a traditional turn-based RPG that gives you some kind of control, I like better than just putting a cursor on somebody.
[125:19.18]Timed hits are more fun for me because it engages me in the game.
[125:21.74]Yeah, I thought it was good.
[125:27.09]I was sad to see that they weren't gonna do anything more with that franchise or that series.
[125:33.01]Because it wasn't, um... What's the designer's name?
[125:36.15]He was commissioned to do two or three games for the Xbox, and then that was it.
[125:40.95]And there was talk that he might do another one, but it never came out, never happened.
[125:44.14]It's the same guy that did Blue Dragon, right?
[125:53.94]Was it Blue Dragon, right?
[125:54.84]Am I thinking of the right thing?
[125:55.58]Am I excited for Cooking Simulator tomorrow?
[126:01.52]Oh, hell yeah.
[126:05.07]So, yeah, yeah, I did want to see another installment in the series.
[126:09.27]I thought if they had a second go at it, they could have improved on some of the things that I didn't like and made a better game.
[126:13.89]And, you know, I think it was a solid game to begin with.
[126:16.77]But, yeah.
[126:20.56]But thank you for the $2.50, Rock Esper.
[126:24.90]Creamy Sensation, thanks for the $5.
[126:27.02]Appreciate it.
[126:28.82]No message, thank you.
[126:31.03]Surgile butt thanks for the 250.
[126:32.39]I've been under a few times and each time has been such a trip.
[126:37.46]I had a liver biopsy at like 17 and I was still young enough to be in the pediatric hospital.
[126:45.12]So I came to just slurring.
[126:47.84]Oh fuck that feels so weird.
[126:50.08]I can't even feel my eyes yet.
[126:52.30]God damn it.
[126:53.70]Next to a five-year-old playing on his iPad.
[127:06.80]That's a good, that's a good story.
[127:09.22]That was a good story.
[127:16.02]Oh, fuck.
[127:17.00]This feels so weird.
[127:20.12]Thank you for the 250, Sergio, but... And then SpaceDadRules thanks for the $15 right at the very end.

[127:58.22]That's not the name of the game.
[127:59.38]The game's going to be called Cooking Simulator.
[128:01.93]I'm going to show you some healthy recipes that you can have in your home with low spices.
[128:07.77]I promise on the next Dr. Oz.
[128:18.04]Do the whole stream as Dr. Oz.
[128:21.56]Okay, if I didn't say anything, if I talked like that,
[128:27.44]Just from the beginning of the stream.
[128:30.52]People would be fucking so irritated by that, I think.
[128:33.39]If I didn't, like, make it a joke if I was just doing that.
[128:37.71]I would give that, like, 15 to 20 minutes before people were like, Stop doing this.
[128:43.03]Stop fucking doing that.
[128:44.37]Why are you doing that?
[128:46.13]And I just didn't.
[128:46.81]It would...
[128:49.00]I would get too self-conscious and have to stop it.
[128:51.04]Unless it was like a very specific bit or routine that I was planning or doing.
[128:56.26]I couldn't talk like Dr. Oz during the whole stream.
[129:02.68]You say you think that would be funny.
[129:05.70]But after five minutes, let's see.
[129:14.69]Dr. Oz for Jerma Rumble.
[129:16.37]Okay.
[129:16.67]Yeah.
[129:17.43]Yep.
[129:18.01]Oh, you better fucking believe it.
[129:19.74]I swear to God.
[129:22.32]I swear to God.
[129:25.10]Yes.
[129:25.64]I'm seeing a lot of no's.
[129:26.80]Yes.
[129:29.22]I don't care.
[129:29.76]Dr. Oz is going to be like in the next ladder match.
[129:36.11]You heard it here first.
[129:36.85]It's going to happen.
[129:38.92]This is a one-off joke.
[129:40.22]Yes, I know.
[129:41.58]So the 1,400 people here, you're the only people that are going to think this is funny.
[129:47.57]No one else is going to know what this is.
[129:49.09]And I don't care.
[129:50.03]That's fine.
[129:52.43]And scan his face and put it in.
[129:54.33]People are going to be like, why?
[129:58.53]Is Dr. Oz here?
[129:59.55]Do you watch Dr. Oz?
[130:00.89]The only way that would be possible is if I watched Dr. Oz every day.
[130:06.04]And I was a fan.
[130:07.62]I'll just pretend to be a fan.
[130:10.97]Yeah.
[130:12.83]That sounds about right.
[130:19.84]Yeah, now I gotta watch Dr. Oz to get some info.
[130:23.04]So I can make some interesting references.
[130:29.40]I gotta do some Dr. Oz research, yeah.
[130:32.20]I gotta find out what kind of shirts he wears, the pants he wears.
[130:40.41]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
