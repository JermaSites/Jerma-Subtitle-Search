[01:10.95]Very, very specific.
[01:12.35]What?
[01:13.15]Turn this back on.
[01:14.94]I'm kind of sitting awkwardly in this chair.
[01:17.18]There's a very specific reason why.
[01:19.51]Because I'm going to show you a product today.
[01:23.39]That's right.
[01:23.71]You're going to get a product review from me.
[01:26.75]It's one that we can all agree is a pretty big deal.
[01:30.10]We've been waiting to hear about this.
[01:32.56]No, we haven't.
[01:34.20]It's called The Contractor Left My House 15 Minutes Ago.
[01:36.72]And what the fuck am I going to stream?
[01:40.12]Anyways, before we do the big reveal of what this is, let's talk about the next few days.
[01:49.42]Let's wait until people get here.
[01:53.32]Is it a Comcast review?
[01:54.22]No.
[01:55.02]Not yet.
[01:57.61]I'm actually pretty excited about this.
[01:59.03]I saw this in the store today.
[02:00.79]I was like, I kind of have to fucking have this.
[02:04.53]And I have to stream this.
[02:08.09]so uh anyways uh let me let me just wait till people get here so we can describe the big stream coming up here on Sunday that's right Sunday afternoon actually there are two more big streams after that so stay tuned this is gonna be a good one I don't know we'll see in about 10 minutes
[02:34.94]But, so, you know what's throwing me off?
[02:39.13]I gotta get this fucking thing out of the way.
[02:41.59]Like, hey, look, let me show you.
[02:44.25]This is like looking into the mirror.
[02:48.02]Like, look at this.
[02:49.62]I know you're gonna be a thousand, but look, I'm like in that camera ahead of me.
[02:55.31]And I'm seeing myself move around and it's like fucking freaking me out.
[02:58.91]Like I can't, I can't handle it.
[03:00.81]I have to not be able to look.
[03:02.15]I'm looking at myself talking and it's delayed by 650 milliseconds.
[03:06.43]So I'm just like fucking, I'm in a different dimension.
[03:09.85]Here we go.
[03:10.19]That's better.
[03:11.17]Now I can't see it.
[03:13.07]Well, now you can't see it either.
[03:15.13]But you're probably wondering what the fuck are you doing?
[03:16.47]Why is the camera there?
[03:17.27]Well, not yet.
[03:19.91]We have to wait a few more minutes.
[03:23.76]I am now I am because yeah, we're gonna do like a POV thing I'm gonna like make pancakes and I'm gonna make eggs and we're gonna do like a POV hand thing No, that's not that's not a D I C K cam come on man Guitar hero we're not gonna play.
[03:38.21]No, that's not how I'm gonna don't that's not what we're doing We're not doing that.
[03:42.10]The title of the stream is the Gamer V Portable.
[03:44.08]That's what we're doing.
[03:45.34]But Listen, okay.
[03:48.16]I'm see look this is what I'm seeing.
[03:49.94]I
[03:51.20]It's too... You know when you put on headphones and you scramble your own brain?
[03:55.70]And you know, like the speech jammer?
[03:59.32]Take a look at this.
[04:00.36]I am speech jamming myself visually.
[04:03.66]That's what I see.
[04:06.60]It's just right in front of me.
[04:08.16]See, and watch.
[04:08.66]It's like I'm talking and then like he's talking and it's like I'm staring into the abyss.
[04:15.35]I have to get this off the fucking screen before I lose my mind.
[04:19.55]Get out of the way.
[04:21.59]Leave me alone.
[04:22.69]I can't move it.
[04:23.39]Alright, here we go.
[04:25.39]There, it's out of the fucking way now.
[04:27.88]Let's just turn this off.
[04:30.16]Okay.
[04:31.18]Hi, guys.
[04:31.72]Now I'm not being speech jammed.
[04:34.32]Anyway, so over the next couple of days, you're going to see something interesting here.
[04:37.16]On Sunday, which is not tomorrow, but the next day, we're going to stream pretty much starting Sunday afternoon.
[04:46.17]And we're going to go until Comcast turns off.
[04:51.20]Oh my god, Kazzy101 just gave out 10 community subs.
[04:55.88]Holy shit, dude, thank you.
[04:57.38]Thank you, Kazzy101, for the 10 tier 1 community subs, man.
[05:01.20]Thanks a lot.
[05:03.56]That's incredibly generous, thank you.
[05:05.84]But anywho, so my internet is scheduled to turn off here on October 1st.
[05:13.00]Now, I don't know really when on October 1st.
[05:16.34]I've been told a couple of different times.
[05:18.67]But we're just going to go Sunday into Monday morning until they fucking turn us off.
[05:25.09]So that's going to be the until they turn us off stream.
[05:28.39]Should be fun.
[05:28.93]We're going to try to time it.
[05:31.27]It might be midnight.
[05:32.71]It might be 12.
[05:33.25]It might be 3.
[05:34.07]I don't know.
[05:34.37]I have no idea.
[05:35.17]It might be like 6 o'clock in the morning.
[05:36.93]I have no clue.
[05:38.03]It could be something crazy like that.
[05:40.45]Protest Comcast.
[05:41.52]No, I'm going to wait until they turn us off.
[05:45.00]So that should be interesting.
[05:46.44]And then...
[05:47.81]A couple days later, after that is going to be the green screen stream.
[05:51.73]I'm not going to have internet here anymore.
[05:53.45]And then a few days after that is another stream that is also going to be on location.
[05:58.29]So, there's three more streams before I hit Vegas.
[06:03.33]This one... No, sorry.
[06:05.31]Four more streams.
[06:06.49]This one, until they shut us off stream on Sunday.
[06:09.65]And then, after that, the two streams that I talked about already, where I don't have to have internet.
[06:16.23]But...
[06:17.23]More importantly, tonight.
[06:20.25]I have a couple of appointments that... I'm like in between appointments right now.
[06:25.01]Sorry if I'm a little scatterbrained right now and all fucked up and getting speech jammed.
[06:29.72]It's because I was up this morning at like 7 o'clock in the morning.
[06:34.28]Bunch of shit going on.
[06:35.68]This is like the in between period where I can stream right now.
[06:38.30]And then I gotta go.
[06:39.06]Like I gotta go in like 3 hours.
[06:41.27]I got about 2 to 3 hours right here.
[06:43.49]And then it's back to another thing to do.
[06:45.27]So...
[06:46.43]You know, I gotta get out of here.
[06:47.43]You know what I'm saying?
[06:48.05]I gotta go.
[06:48.43]I gotta get out of here.
[06:49.17]So we'll take that as you will, and let's go ahead and show off the product.
[06:54.41]Doctor's... No, it's not... I'm not bringing anybody to a doctor's office.
[06:59.32]Anywho, the reason why this fucking camera is here... Fucking speech jamming me... Is because we're gonna move my facecam over here... Like this.
[07:14.44]This is why there's a POV of me.
[07:16.46]Actually, let's show it on the screen first.
[07:19.56]Why not?
[07:22.60]Let me ask you a question, guys.
[07:24.46]As somebody that is usually on the go, I've got a bunch of appointments.
[07:28.84]So I've got an appointment before, I had an appointment later.
[07:31.48]And, you know, you've got your cell phone, everybody has a cell phone.
[07:33.61]You can browse Twitter and Reddit, but you can't play any video games, right?
[07:39.15]You just have no access to that.
[07:40.75]What, are you going to carry around a Switch?
[07:42.77]That thing's fucking huge, and it weighs like nine pounds.
[07:45.59]You're not going to be able to lift that around wherever you go.
[07:48.26]And your phone, open up your phone and open up a game and play on your phone.
[07:52.62]What's that?
[07:53.24]Oh, shit, I drained my battery at 41%.
[07:55.94]I've been here for like five minutes.
[07:57.32]No, that's a thing of the past.
[07:59.10]Because we've got some product to show off here that I think you're all going to really enjoy.
[08:03.26]And I'm talking about the Gamer V Portable device.
[08:08.08]Here it is right here.
[08:09.86]Three AAA batteries.
[08:12.14]There are 220 games on here.
[08:15.53]And the thing isn't even as big as a phone, like I said.
[08:17.61]Look, it's like you can fit this in your other pocket.
[08:21.01]Let's do a comparison real quick.
[08:23.31]Ow!
[08:24.49]What, you didn't hear that?
[08:25.19]Never mind, it didn't even shake.
[08:26.82]Let's just do a quick comparison real quick.
[08:28.64]What do you say?
[08:32.94]Here is a piece of shit iPhone 6.
[08:36.34]Never have one of these.
[08:37.02]They're the worst one I've ever had in my life.
[08:38.34]They're a piece of garbage.
[08:39.70]And here is the Gamma V portable device, right?
[08:43.73]But that's not even... Look at how much smaller this is.
[08:47.18]It's like having another little phone in your pocket, right?
[08:51.44]Look at that.
[08:52.02]Isn't that just fucking cool?
[08:54.55]By the way, I probably should make this very clear.
[08:58.36]I bought this at CVS because I had nothing to stream.
[09:01.18]And, like, I fucked up something over here so I couldn't stream from, like, the PS4.
[09:05.16]I didn't want to... I didn't want to stream L.A.
[09:08.11]Noire again because I only have, like, two and a half hours.
[09:11.25]So I was at CVS and I fucking saw this and I was like, that's what I'm streaming tonight.
[09:15.29]So that's what you get.
[09:16.21]The Gamer V Portable.
[09:18.61]It has 220 games and we're going to try them.
[09:22.35]Expendable income.
[09:23.30]This thing... No, no, no, no, no.
[09:24.30]Wait, wait, wait.
[09:25.08]Let me be... Hold on.
[09:26.85]This thing was less than 20 bucks.
[09:29.43]It takes three AAA vets.
[09:30.69]No, look, it's not a CVS sellout.
[09:33.29]That's not even true.
[09:34.31]You can get everything.
[09:35.13]You can get toilet paper at CVS.
[09:36.49]What, are you going to sell out your ass?
[09:38.83]No, I mean, like, you can't be a sellout for CVS.
[09:42.61]They have everything.
[09:43.83]They've got toilet paper.
[09:45.87]They've got tissue paper.
[09:48.93]What else do they sell at CVS?
[09:51.01]They got water.
[09:52.73]They have...
[09:56.22]do they have you know I got toilet paper anywho here we go CVS by the way oh can you believe those receipts you know they print out those fucking receipts it's uh it's crazy it's crazy here we go you're gonna get a pov here of the Gamer V Portable I've already done some uh tweaking to make it so it would show up on the camera we're gonna we're not we might not play all 220 of them
[10:23.00]But this is first-person Jeremy mode.
[10:25.14]Oh, let me... This is off-center.
[10:28.14]Yeah, this is what it's like to sit here as me.
[10:31.18]You got, like, you're dunking donuts.
[10:33.56]I've had that for about four and a half hours now.
[10:37.01]I nurse it, you know what I mean?
[10:42.23]And, I mean, let's talk about, like, the feel of it first, you know?
[10:47.05]That's pretty good.
[10:47.69]It's a nice feel.
[10:49.41]Two buttons for your command center here.
[10:52.09]It's like, you know, I like to think of this like a mobile command center, right?
[10:56.13]That's how I would see it.
[10:57.51]Got an on and off switch, reset, start.
[11:00.86]So let's go ahead and try this out.
[11:02.22]Stalling.
[11:03.16]He's stalling.
[11:04.12]Let's turn it on.
[11:04.78]I hope you guys can hear this.
[11:06.38]Here we go.
[11:06.90]First ever boot up of the device.
[11:08.80]I'm ready.
[11:10.43]You know what?
[11:11.47]I'm going to see some PogChamps in the chat before I turn this on.
[11:13.75]I don't fucking care.
[11:20.89]Can you guys see?
[11:25.63]Can you hear it?
[11:29.35]You can hear it, right?
[11:30.15]Alright, so there's 220 games here.
[11:39.64]Louder?
[11:40.10]Hold on, I can fix that.
[11:43.56]Listen to this fucking sound.

[12:03.27]Can you guys hear it?
[12:07.77]Can you guys hear it?
[12:14.43]Okay, this is what we're gonna do.
[12:24.49]I'm gonna turn this way down.
[12:26.41]And like you can hear me too, right?
[12:27.61]But you can't hear me here.
[12:29.35]Right?
[12:29.61]Is that better?
[12:32.44]Is that better?
[12:36.24]Oh, it's an echo.
[12:37.38]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[12:50.47]You gotta sing a fucking CVS, okay?
[12:52.11]Give me a break.
[12:53.04]Give me a break, it's been rough!
[12:55.40]Where is it?
[12:57.92]Give me a break, it's been rough!

[13:06.84]Alright, that's better, right?
[13:09.54]You good?
[13:11.84]That's better.
[13:16.09]The mic just fucked up?
[13:22.25]Let's play CBS.
[13:25.47]How are there two Jeremy's?
[13:27.35]There's not.
[13:27.73]There's only one.
[13:31.83]Yeah, but it's not.
[13:33.02]But here.
[13:33.58]We might have to just use this mic.
[13:37.62]How is that the wrong mic?
[13:38.76]That's not even possible.
[13:43.83]That's fine.
[13:46.33]The quality got worse.
[13:47.77]No, that's correct.
[13:48.21]That's correct.
[13:50.31]It's the dog shit one.
[13:51.19]But you know what?
[13:51.75]We're gonna have to deal with it.
[13:53.43]Alright, here we go.
[13:58.02]Now at least you guys can hear the sound.
[13:59.40]Get out the fucking way.
[14:00.60]I'm not even using this one.
[14:01.90]How does it look?
[14:02.34]Is it nice and clean looking?
[14:08.30]It sounds terrible.
[14:12.76]Alright, we're gonna play, we're gonna play Curly Snail.
[14:18.05]What is it called?
[14:20.35]Curly, curly monkey.
[14:23.47]Curly monkey 2, actually, for those of you that are curious.
[14:27.67]People, who's giving a fucking million subs right now?
[14:29.89]This is the worst stream I've ever done.
[14:32.70]Look, a contractor just left, I got an appointment, and then my internet turns off.
[14:43.43]Who just gave all those subs?
[14:45.53]Alright, this is gonna drive me crazy.
[14:48.51]The mic is just peaking.
[14:50.45]Let me listen to this shit.
[14:53.58]Go back to the other.
[14:54.32]Hold on.
[14:54.64]What if I do this?
[14:56.06]I have an idea.
[14:56.88]And it's just crazy enough to fucking work.
[14:59.74]I got it.
[15:02.42]Check this shit out.
[15:03.36]Where's the tape?
[15:05.22]Where's the tape?
[15:09.16]Just bear with me here.
[15:09.96]A contractor just left my house.
[15:13.58]I'm going to wrap this around the pole.
[15:15.74]You might see the microphone pop up.
[15:17.90]But you're going to have to deal with it.
[15:18.78]Let's just tape it.
[15:23.64]What?
[15:24.20]Why put it in your fucking mouth for?
[15:28.24]I hate the sound of tape.
[15:29.24]I'm sorry, guys.
[15:30.05]This is like turning on an oven for me.
[15:31.65]I don't like ovens.
[15:32.59]I hate turning on an oven and it freaks me out.
[15:34.17]I like this box in your house that heats up to like fucking 500 degrees.
[15:36.65]I don't like it.
[15:37.01]It's weird and it's gas.
[15:38.21]This is also, I don't like this.
[15:41.43]Okay.

[15:45.83]Just get it right here.
[15:47.11]You can still...
[16:33.41]It's a fucking muffling effect.
[16:47.04]Why does this tape smell like acid?
[16:50.50]This tape stinks.
[16:52.74]Here we go.
[16:53.14]Alright, I think I figured it out.
[16:56.26]I think I got it, right?

[17:44.17]I didn't wash my hands.
[17:45.23]Fuck that.
[17:47.37]There we go.
[17:50.35]Ow!

[19:21.15]Cut my nails?
[19:21.77]My nails are a perfect length for a person my age.
[19:26.65]This is actually kind of good quality.
[19:27.96]Like, I'm not even kidding.
[19:28.92]I'm not fucking around.
[19:32.28]Not sponsored, by the way.
[19:34.14]Can you guys see?
[19:38.04]I need, like, a good angle.
[19:44.12]How many... How much... Where's my health?
[19:45.18]Watch out for the bat.
[19:48.80]So that is a boomerang, right?
[19:50.02]Am I crazy?
[19:56.11]Got him.
[20:01.03]Alright.
[20:02.90]No, I'm not going to smash it.
[20:04.28]Somebody said smash it.
[20:05.16]Well, there's a portal.
[20:05.74]I got a portal device here.
[20:07.20]I can go in?
[20:08.60]How do I go in?
[20:10.40]That just hurt my eyes.
[20:12.75]Pretty detailed environments.
[20:14.09]Corn?
[20:14.39]Oh, I died.
[20:17.25]That's alright.
[20:17.59]I got a checkpoint right here.
[20:21.67]Smash it.
[20:22.57]I'm not going to smash it.
[20:24.71]I'm not smashing this.
[20:27.07]This thing is kind of cool.
[20:31.28]I can see myself playing this on the airplane, man.
[20:33.75]I'm not even kidding.
[20:34.67]There's 200 games on here.
[20:36.77]This is just one game out of 220.
[20:44.05]I like this one, too.
[20:44.87]This kind of reminds me of Adventure Island and Mega Man together.
[20:49.05]Oh, whoops.
[20:58.39]This looks way better on my screen than it does on yours, by the way.
[21:01.19]In case you're curious.
[21:04.71]How is it?
[21:04.97]Is it blurry?
[21:05.59]Can you hear it?
[21:05.99]What is the end?
[21:12.69]Nails.
[21:13.89]Stop talking like a YouTuber.
[21:15.99]I can't.
[21:16.33]I'm sorry, man.
[21:16.87]I can't help it.
[21:17.41]I got a thing in my hand and I'm advertising it.
[21:20.12]Again, I bought this.
[21:21.16]I didn't.
[21:21.62]Nobody paid me for this.
[21:23.76]And there's like Sonic the Hedgehog weeds there.
[21:25.26]Okay, cool.
[21:27.94]I'm supposed to give, like, okay, for this to be, like, less than a two-hour stream, I need to, each one of these has to be, like, 30 seconds.
[21:35.24]I've been playing this one for five minutes.
[21:47.93]What will they think?
[21:49.31]My back hurts.
[21:50.31]Is that, is that because?
[21:52.07]Alright, exit.
[21:52.81]How do I reset it?
[21:56.23]Okay, good.
[21:57.35]I'm ready for the next one.
[21:59.81]The next one is Thunderman.
[22:02.08]This looks kind of good.
[22:06.36]There we go.
[22:06.68]Now it's louder.
[22:08.12]What if I turn this up a little bit?
[22:09.20]Is that going to be too loud if I do my YouTuber voice?
[22:11.26]Is that too loud?
[22:11.88]Look, you want to see how fucking stupid this is?
[22:17.22]Look at this, guys.
[22:23.37]This is the shit I'm doing right now.
[22:25.58]Like, really?
[22:28.60]That's not a GoPro.
[22:29.60]This is just webcam into... There's still tape here.
[22:33.68]I can't even cut this.
[22:34.76]I don't have anything to cut this with.
[22:36.22]Listen to me.
[22:36.78]A contractor was at my house.
[22:44.89]I can't reach.
[22:48.99]No, don't knock the TV over.
[22:50.73]Don't knock over the TV.
[22:52.45]It's going to fall.
[22:53.41]It's going to fall.
[22:57.87]Okay, that's better.
[22:59.11]Alright, uh, Thunder Man.
[23:09.56]Is that a Dragon Ball Z character?
[23:12.20]This is like... This is like, um... Like a beat-em-up?
[23:18.04]That's a pretty high jump.
[23:21.61]Oh, he dropped the bombs.
[23:22.55]The same health pool as the monkey game.
[23:24.71]It's almost like it was made by the same guy.
[23:29.23]This one's kind of fun.
[23:34.42]This one's kind of fun.
[23:36.44]Anything else to say, Jeremy?
[23:37.62]This one's kind of fun.
[23:38.24]I'm going to have to turn the brightness up a little.
[23:44.26]Do I have a double jump?
[23:49.90]No, I don't.
[23:51.70]Yes, I do.
[23:52.92]Hold on a second.
[23:53.38]Wait.
[23:54.97]Do I have a double jump?
[24:00.66]I might, hold on, just hold it.
[24:02.56]Nah, do a double jump.
[24:04.31]Fuck.
[24:11.27]I just like scratched my fucking chin.
[24:18.23]Is that too close?
[24:18.89]You guys can't even read the description there.
[24:20.81]I gotta keep it right here.
[24:22.33]Just don't move.
[24:22.93]My back hurts, but whatever.
[24:24.11]Fuck it.
[24:25.65]Do it for the art.
[24:26.35]It's for the art.
[24:27.25]You know what I mean?
[24:27.76]It's for the art.
[24:32.67]Except for the pickup truck.
[24:33.70]I only have one more hit before we go to... Okay, that was fun.
[24:39.80]We're going to go to game number three of 220, Vanguard.
[24:43.52]Is it a game with tanks in it?
[24:48.30]I'm not going to last that long.
[24:50.06]Is my chin bleeding?
[25:02.79]I'm gonna throw this off like look at the camera inside of my fucking throat Look at that like shitty peach fuzz This is a how is this somehow better

[25:44.40]Did I already lose?
[25:47.92]Look, it's been rocked, man.
[25:49.44]Alright, so that's me.
[25:50.30]I'm the tank, right?
[25:50.87]Let me turn the brightness up on this piece of shit.
[26:05.13]I don't want to be too bright, though, because then we'll lose the graphical fidelity.
[26:08.23]I thought it just went upside down.
[26:17.46]Alright, that's fine.
[26:18.40]Alright, let's go.
[26:20.68]I'm ready.
[26:21.45]Vanguard.
[26:23.65]Level 1.
[26:28.01]Do you get a tank?
[26:30.57]Why am I blinking?
[26:32.77]Alright, that was easy.
[26:33.51]I won.
[26:34.73]Okay, what's the next one?
[26:38.07]Battle Plan.
[26:40.95]Same thing, but in an airplane.

[27:13.38]That's fucking awesome, mom.
[27:15.56]You know you would, so don't pretend like you wouldn't.
[27:17.84]That one was fun.
[27:24.46]No, I wouldn't.
[27:24.86]Yes, you would.
[27:26.64]Don't pretend like this is like a cute little thing that you can display on your mantle.
[27:31.76]Alright, champion boat.
[27:33.76]Let's try champ.
[27:34.58]Okay, is it better?
[27:35.18]What if I just go like this?

[27:38.83]I don't know.
[27:39.83]I should just like tape this.
[27:40.93]I really should.
[28:18.86]No, it's too close.
[28:20.04]It's not going to work.
[28:20.81]Stop giving me these ideas.
[28:22.45]Look, I got residue.
[28:23.73]I got fucking residue on my Gamer V Portable.
[28:30.19]Fuck.
[28:32.08]People are gifting a shitload of subs and I'm missing all of them.

[29:06.19]Yeah, that's better.
[29:07.67]I'm not gonna crush this in one hand, I can't.
[29:10.63]We will do like a resistance test after I play all 220.
[29:14.35]We have to play... Okay, I'm... Ten seconds for each one.
[29:17.37]I want you to say, Move on, Jay!
[29:20.35]You know what I mean?
[29:22.31]Move on, Jay!
[29:25.14]After ten seconds, okay?
[29:28.38]Starting when I press the button.
[29:31.96]I haven't pressed the button yet.
[29:33.56]No, don't do that.
[29:34.94]Here we go.
[29:35.30]Ready?
[29:36.04]This is like Animal Crossing.
[29:40.01]Where am I?
[29:40.49]Oh, it's a racing game.
[29:44.27]Am I in the... Where am I?
[29:45.15]I guess the wall?

[29:50.98]Out.
[29:54.36]Oh, I get it.
[29:54.88]Okay, I get it, I get it.
[29:55.82]It's just... You have to hold down A and then... It's like the old stock car games.
[30:00.58]This is on Mario Party.
[30:05.90]No, I'm not moving on yet.
[30:09.30]Oh, they make it too hard.
[30:10.20]This is too hard.
[30:18.98]I'm trying to put my arms all the way out here.
[30:25.30]Oh, we've really only done five?
[30:27.66]It's been 30 minutes.
[30:31.92]How is it possible that it's been 30 fucking minutes and I've only done five?
[30:42.14]Wait, why is CurlyMonkey1 ahead of CurlyMonkey2?
[30:50.28]Because I was stalling.
[30:51.52]No, I'm not.
[30:52.34]Stage 1.
[30:52.84]Let's go.
[30:53.32]Action.
[30:57.11]They really fucked it up in the sequel.
[31:00.75]Like, honest to God, they're... This one's called Enchanter.
[31:09.72]The Enchanter.
[31:11.72]It's the same guy, same, like, Dragon Ball Z character that they've taken and ripped off here.
[31:19.72]What did it do?
[31:20.24]Okay, I guess I can place a... What, a pentagram down?
[31:26.81]Is this like Donkey Kong?
[31:29.27]You have to get up to the top and then put the pentagram on a Donkey Kong's shirt?
[31:33.87]What did they do in that game?
[31:36.03]Yeah, this is actually kind of cool.
[31:37.95]This is actually what's kind of fun.
[31:41.39]Alright, every time I say that...
[31:43.78]I have to... I have to do 10 jumping jacks from here on out if I say, no, this one's actually kind of fun.
[31:51.16]10 jumping jacks.
[31:52.92]Not counting that one.
[31:56.36]Move on, Jay.
[31:57.14]No, wait, wait, wait.
[31:57.76]I gotta get to the end of this one.
[31:59.26]I'm Edward Elric.
[32:00.52]I'm Twitch Elric.
[32:04.82]How do I go down?
[32:09.16]How do I beat this one?
[32:12.42]I don't...
[32:16.29]Did it just kill all the enemies?
[32:19.76]I think so.
[32:20.12]Alright, well, this one's dumb.
[32:25.06]Okay, now we're at superhero.
[32:30.30]This one looks interesting.
[32:31.62]Ah, don't.
[32:32.06]Okay, every time I say this one looks interesting, it's down to $10.
[32:41.64]Is that a guy from the Fairly OddParents?
[32:45.63]Who is that?
[32:47.43]That's Stan Smith.
[32:48.55]Not the Fairly... Stan Smith.
[32:50.23]Alright, I'm ready.
[32:53.47]You're in a car?
[32:55.89]What does this have to do... Why is the guy dressed up in a superhero costume?
[32:59.01]He just drives around in a car.
[33:01.76]Why is it a platformer with a car?
[33:05.44]Why can the car jump?
[33:07.36]I guess is a better question.
[33:12.52]I have no idea.
[33:14.18]Whatever.
[33:19.30]This is the best one so far.
[33:23.40]Oh, no, okay, so if you get hit, you get out of the car.
[33:26.42]And you have a laser?
[33:34.56]What the fuck?
[33:35.14]Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
[33:39.96]What am I turning into?
[33:42.62]Well, I'm a different guy.
[33:43.46]Right, what the hell is that?
[33:50.58]No, we can't move on yet.
[33:51.96]I'm sorry.

[34:04.91]Am I touching my belly button?
[34:07.67]Look.
[34:11.07]Like I'm picking lint out of my belly button and then lighting it on fire.
[34:14.05]Alright, that's it.
[34:19.42]Move on, man.

[43:48.28]Is he kidding?
[43:55.31]This one's awful.
[43:55.95]I can't play that anymore.
[43:56.75]Alright, we're almost like halfway there.
[43:58.19]Alright, we got fruit boxes.
[44:01.27]Fruit boxes.
[44:14.94]Hold on.
[44:24.15]Where are you?
[44:26.05]Where are you?
[44:27.13]It's Frere Jacques.
[44:32.84]That's better, right?
[44:33.54]A little bit more clear.
[44:35.56]There we go.
[44:39.12]Look at that.
[44:39.56]That looks fucking beautiful.
[44:47.61]Where are you?
[44:48.69]What do you mean jumping jacks?
[44:51.50]Oh, fine.
[44:52.50]You're right.
[44:52.86]No, you guys are right.
[44:53.36]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[45:00.02]I did 12 for you guys.
[45:02.13]Let me get back in the chair.
[45:18.24]I'll make it look fucking easy.
[45:19.20]I'll make it look easy.
[45:25.96]Alright, let's keep going.
[45:26.76]We're at 30.
[45:28.06]What time is it?
[45:28.62]I have an appointment.
[45:30.84]Oh, yeah.
[45:31.50]Remind him again.
[45:32.26]What am I doing?
[45:37.58]Alright.
[45:39.38]Fruit boxes.
[45:43.61]Ooh, it's like Kirby.
[45:49.81]What the fuck is this?
[45:55.31]What is happening?
[45:56.05]I'm playing against another person.
[45:59.27]Do I have to make a box?
[46:03.56]Oh, this is just Connect 4, but confusing and dumb.
[46:09.56]Because if I make this, then he's going to finish the whole box up there.
[46:12.96]I don't want to do that.
[46:15.99]Oh, fuck you, man.
[46:16.49]We're going to go this way.
[46:20.95]Actually, I'm more comfortable like this.
[46:22.15]I'm not even playing around with anybody in the chat here.
[46:38.03]Come on.
[46:38.55]I want to... Okay, if you didn't know any better, you would think that my chin was on the bottom of this.
[46:47.43]Okay.
[46:49.37]This is actually kind of comfortable though.
[46:55.09]Posture -2.
[46:56.13]No, it's not.
[46:57.25]I'm leaning.
[46:57.76]Look at this.
[46:58.36]I'll show you a better angle.
[47:00.87]Like this is what I'm doing.
[47:22.34]Yeah, guys.
[47:24.53]My doctor decided to give me this contraption to make sure I don't get nerd neck.
[47:30.69]I gotta keep my chin here and lean forward like this and use the muscles.
[47:42.08]Nerd.
[47:43.30]Nerd neck.
[47:44.64]I'm not attached to this.
[47:45.74]Why am I pretending I am?
[47:47.75]That's comfortable though.
[47:48.77]Actually, you know what?
[47:50.15]Let's make a tape cushion.
[47:51.23]That's going to be comfy.
[47:55.89]Hold on.
[47:56.38]I got to...
[48:22.65]Ah, see?
[48:43.21]See?
[48:44.15]Wait, you can't even hear me.
[48:46.01]Oh, now you can hear me, okay.
[48:47.41]So now I got my cushion here, my neck, so I don't get fucking nerd neck.
[48:53.79]loud is it I don't think so look at this shit oh I'm gonna I'm preventing nerd neck are you really is that what we're doing more like giving it to myself don't look at that
[49:35.37]This is actually more comfortable.
[49:44.06]This is much more comfortable.
[49:46.10]I can actually rest on here.
[49:48.91]Okay, are you ready to do this?
[50:06.78]Alright, let's go.
[50:07.45]Let's get out of this.
[50:08.43]Can you guys hear me?
[50:11.61]What if I just started taping around to keep myself connected?
[50:14.67]No, I don't want to do that.
[50:15.97]I don't want to rip out hairs.
[50:16.99]Alright, how about... Galaga.
[50:29.02]Galagant.
[50:44.59]Hey, what do you do for a living?
[50:49.33]I, uh... I, uh... I'm a dentist.
[50:58.16]This one's fucking... One of those games that you shoot out of a can.
[51:07.40]This one's responsive.
[51:11.69]It is actually really responsive.
[51:12.93]That's one thing.
[51:13.33]The control system is responsive.
[51:15.41]It's quick.
[51:17.20]You guys can't even see.
[51:18.30]What a fucking terrible streamer.
[51:21.42]It's cocked.
[51:22.60]It's cocked this way.
[51:24.66]I have to tilt my hands this way so you can see my fucking baby game gear.
[51:31.14]I gotta get to a boss, right?
[51:33.28]At least on this one.
[51:34.46]I played The Binding of Isaac a bunch.
[51:35.70]I'm pretty good at tractoring people.
[51:37.82]You know what I mean?
[51:38.24]I played The Binding of Isaac.
[51:41.60]You know, like platinumgod.co.uk, you know what I mean?
[51:43.92]Like, I know that website.
[51:44.82]I'm fucking smart about it.
[51:48.62]Is that the wrong web?
[51:49.39]That might be the wrong website.
[52:01.83]Oh, it's like the more you hit, you can actually go faster.
[52:05.69]You can shoot faster if you make direct contact.
[52:07.83]I won.
[52:09.39]Don't tell me I didn't beat one of these.
[52:13.90]This one's called Greedy.
[52:20.25]My posture is an eight.
[52:25.15]What the fuck does that even mean?
[52:30.07]Oh, I like the snake.
[52:31.38]I like the little snake.
[52:32.34]The little gushers filled with candy juice.
[52:40.30]What?
[52:42.35]Oh, I was in the top.
[52:43.21]I didn't know I was in the top.
[52:44.55]What the fuck?
[52:47.37]It's just snake.
[52:53.36]Very slow snake.
[52:55.86]I was really good at this on the old Nokia phones.
[52:57.82]I could get the snake to be 100 feet long.
[53:01.24]I'm not even kidding.
[53:02.30]Oh, no!
[53:10.77]Got it.
[53:23.44]I don't want you to... It ruins the magic.
[53:26.06]I don't want you to be able to see all this stuff up there.
[53:31.46]That's why I'm trying to block it out with this.
[53:32.72]I don't want to ruin the magic.
[53:33.86]It's actually going to take a long time for me to lose this.
[53:42.76]This room plays Binding of Isaac on Nokia phone.
[53:47.12]You know what, Ed?
[53:47.94]Hey, Ed.
[53:49.74]Ed.
[53:50.75]I got a good idea for the next Binding of Isaac, an item.
[53:53.91]Why not make it so after, you know, a certain amount of, you know, whatever points you have in luck, you actually turn, you make it like a snake.
[54:01.10]You can actually hurt yourself if you run into it, but if you touch other, okay, I like, I'm, I just lost because I'm talking.
[54:07.56]Wow.
[54:09.56]You pick up an item, and it turns you into a snake like this, like the Nokia snake.
[54:15.79]And then the more enemies you kill, you get a butt behind you, and eventually you can just walk around the whole room and you have a snake folly.
[54:22.55]And don't touch the sides, though, because you'll get hurt, but other people will get hurt if they touch the sides, too.
[54:28.50]And call it, um... Because I got my streamer, but make me call it, like, the Jerma snake, you know what I mean?
[54:34.50]And then I can, like, I can be like, oh, I'm in that game!
[54:36.34]Heh!
[54:37.81]Get off of me.
[54:46.09]Call it greedy.
[54:49.12]Alright, we got... I think my... I think I'm cured.
[54:54.66]Alright, we got front... Where are we?
[54:58.92]Greedy Star.
[55:01.84]I bet you I know about this one.
[55:03.16]It's probably about the YouTuber guy.
[55:06.06]You and Star.
[55:06.76]No, you know that guy.
[55:17.87]What the hell?
[55:23.40]Holy shit, you go really fast.
[55:34.65]What if I just go straight?
[55:35.95]Am I going to run into anything eventually?
[55:37.17]No, I'm going to beat the whole game like this.
[55:40.29]Let's do an experiment.
[55:41.36]I'm going to take my eyes off the screen.
[55:55.54]I don't know if you can lose this game.
[55:57.12]You might not be able to.
[56:00.17]What happened?
[56:01.19]What?
[56:02.63]I got further than anybody ever did.
[56:08.97]Okay, we got Heroes Mice and Heroes Mice 2.
[56:11.16]Wait, isn't this the game that already exists?
[56:12.88]Isn't there a game like this with the same mouse?
[56:18.80]I think so.
[56:21.48]Wait, you have to catch people?
[56:22.76]It's like a trampoline thing?
[56:24.26]Oh, this is Koa's ones.
[56:26.90]Call the fire department because we're the fire department mice.
[56:34.31]I don't get it.
[56:35.63]Am I killing these things?
[56:36.45]Do I have to shoot that thing?
[56:45.75]How am I going to end up timing that correctly?
[57:03.44]I can't stop playing this one.
[57:04.64]That's the thing.
[57:06.88]I'm seeing some ResidentSleepers here, but that's fine.
[57:09.06]I mean... This is very... It's relaxing, though.
[57:17.58]Did I just beat this whole game?
[57:18.46]I'm going to beat the whole game.
[57:32.05]Alright, just come, just like X out of the window and come back to the stream and this is your first experience here.
[57:48.97]How many stages?
[57:49.75]Ow.
[57:50.81]How many stages are there?
[57:53.19]The background is changing.
[57:54.19]They're getting a little faster.
[57:56.49]I played The Binding of Isaac.
[57:57.53]I can handle enemies like this on screen.
[58:00.70]Got him.
[58:03.58]Got him.
[58:08.21]If I say The Binding of Isaac again, I have ten jumping jacks.
[58:14.53]How many things have I said?
[58:15.35]I've got to be careful here.
[58:20.47]Stop ResidentSleeper.
[58:22.03]Stop doing that.
[58:25.89]Move on?
[58:26.39]No, I'm almost at the end of the game.
[58:28.43]Look at how quick.
[58:29.26]I'm going to impress you guys with how fast I'm going to do this.
[58:37.78]I'm not moving on yet.
[58:39.44]Not yet.
[58:39.86]Whoa, I almost missed that one.
[58:41.10]Whoa, intense gaming moment.
[58:48.27]Actually, this is getting kind of harder.
[58:53.47]Come on, end the level.
[58:56.19]Come on, my body hurts.
[58:57.98]I need like a minute between takes here.
[59:00.62]Come on.
[59:02.82]Come on.
[59:12.29]I already beat him.
[59:23.85]I need to just turn this off.
[59:26.07]People are gonna get sick of this real two turns ago.
[59:30.31]I'm almost at 2,000 points!
[59:41.85]Sorry, I'll get the 2,000 points and then turn it off.
[59:43.97]Get it.
[59:44.17]Alright, Heroes Mice 2.
[59:53.96]How is this one different, I wonder?
[59:54.98]A little bit different.
[60:00.06]I think it's just one mouse.
[60:01.32]We lost the other one somehow.
[60:02.66]No, this is a platformer.
[60:06.27]What am I raising my hands up?
[60:09.71]Oh, I get it.
[60:10.13]You actually have to no longer do you get to just go underneath.
[60:15.26]You've got to hit every single one of these.
[60:19.14]Manually.
[60:24.30]Did I miss some?
[60:32.75]Alright, we can skip that one.
[60:34.67]Only like another 200 of these guys.
[60:38.14]So what happens if I don't... Look, I gotta... What happens when I get to the end here?
[60:45.46]Because it's 5 o'clock right now.
[60:46.80]What happens in another 30 or 40 minutes when I gotta get out of here?
[60:50.27]What do I do?
[60:52.97]This guy doesn't bite his nails.
[60:54.45]I don't bite my nails.
[61:02.33]No, I cut them.
[61:05.03]Disgusting.
[61:08.72]That's... Disgusting.
[61:14.11]My nails are disgusting.
[61:17.11]How?
[61:17.65]They're normal.
[61:18.87]Guys, I'm old.
[61:19.59]You have to remember, I'm not like some young, like, 20-year-old that has perfect fucking nails.
[61:26.04]No, man.
[61:26.76]I'm 33.
[61:28.70]For 33, these are perfect.
[61:30.52]These are beautiful.
[61:33.60]You know what I'm saying?
[61:36.02]Just play Binding of Isaac.
[61:38.53]No, I... One, two, three, four.
[62:01.59]There, you got four.
[62:05.49]God damn it.
[62:13.59]It wasn't even, what do you mean it wasn't even real?
[62:16.30]I can't move.
[62:17.92]Don't you understand?
[62:18.52]I'm locked in here.
[62:23.66]If I get up, this whole thing comes with me.
[62:25.32]You understand that, right?
[62:26.28]Like, look.
[62:28.00]I can't move.
[62:29.16]There's a crab holding me in place.
[62:35.26]Just, look, just hold on.
[62:41.44]We're going to play homing chicken.
[62:42.78]Aren't you guys excited?
[62:48.33]You got to do 10 during the green stream.
[62:50.06]I will absolutely do 10 during the green stream.
[62:52.22]I promise.
[62:53.68]Alright, let's do homing chicken.
[63:11.80]I don't understand.
[63:13.06]Do I have to guide them like lemmings?
[63:16.17]This music is killing me.
[63:36.42]Somebody died.
[63:37.08]Whatever.
[63:38.88]Ugh.
[63:41.70]What happens if we don't get to the end?
[63:43.90]Well, then I bite it until it breaks.
[63:47.30]I think.
[63:47.80]I don't know.
[63:48.18]Alright.
[63:50.61]Invincible girl.
[63:51.67]I don't know who that character is, but let's see.
[63:58.75]Am I invincible?
[64:02.28]Is this a brick breaker?
[64:04.28]I hope so.
[64:04.68]I don't get it.
[64:09.46]What's the goal here?
[64:17.53]It is a brick breaker, isn't it?
[64:19.35]Take a look at that.
[64:26.26]Can you lose this, though?
[64:30.38]I don't... I died.
[64:31.90]How did I get hurt?
[64:34.52]Wait, did it come back and hit me in the head?
[64:35.76]Okay.
[64:38.73]Okay.
[64:46.27]Throw a baseball in the air and just go like this.
[64:48.78]I'm gonna hit you right in the fucking forehead.
[64:50.42]Wait, how many people are here?
[65:14.74]Okay, I'm just making sure.
[65:24.17]Easy easy I'm losing my crab here No, alright.
[65:29.41]Well, let's talk about this right now before everybody before everybody asks more questions that need to be answered so as you all know all my stuff is gone and Lot of shit going on the last couple days in this move I'll be I'll be in Las Vegas in less than seven days now less than like five days and
[65:49.85]Or maybe like six.
[65:51.31]But anyways, so I bought this at CVS because this is the only thing I could find that I could stream today.
[65:57.42]If you were just curious.
[65:59.22]Hanging out with my 5,000 friends.
[66:03.96]Because I have another appointment in like an hour.
[66:07.42]So this is what we're doing today.
[66:16.76]What happened to L.A.
[66:17.40]Noire?
[66:18.14]L.A.
[66:18.30]Noire is going to be on Sunday.
[66:20.36]Because I didn't want to start... Okay, look, I don't have to put my chin here.
[66:26.10]I didn't want to start playing L.A.
[66:27.52]Noire again and then turn it off in like an hour and 45 minutes.
[66:33.57]I figured we'd just do something stupid today.
[66:35.63]This is really fucking stupid.
[66:38.53]Like, by far, probably the dumbest thing I've done on stream in like a year and a half.
[66:43.75]And then on Sunday, we're going to go until the internet turns off.
[66:46.71]Then you're gonna get the green screen stream, like, two days later, and then, uh, one more, another two days later, three days later.
[66:53.61]That will be the farewell stream.
[66:57.63]And it'll be in Las Vegas.
[66:59.43]A day later.
[67:00.78]So it should be interesting.
[67:02.98]We're going until the internet turns off on Sunday.
[67:04.90]Like, they're shutting off my internet.
[67:07.40]And I'm gonna, like, go until it's off.
[67:10.40]I wonder how, what if it's, like, perfect tomorrow?
[67:12.24]How fucking hilarious would that be?
[67:13.46]Alright, anyways, let's go.
[67:21.42]Okay, can I move this now?
[67:22.78]Now that that fucking shitty bit is over?
[67:24.92]There we go.
[67:29.26]That's better.
[67:29.76]Right there.
[67:30.28]Right there.
[67:30.80]Get right there.
[67:35.29]Alright.
[67:35.51]You don't even need to see that anymore.
[67:36.49]You can just see me.
[67:37.83]Okay.
[67:42.07]That's not falling, is it?
[67:45.91]Okay, good.
[67:48.49]Just bear with me for a second while I get this back to normal.
[67:54.99]Okay.
[67:57.91]Mr. Funny Guy.
[67:58.89]Fun and games are over.
[67:59.75]Here we go.
[68:04.35]Alright, Invincible Girl was stupid.
[68:05.55]Okay, Irritate.
[68:06.38]Irrigate.
[68:07.10]Let's play Irrigate.
[68:13.84]This is a great setup.
[68:15.30]Oh, it's fucking great.
[68:17.60]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[68:18.37]You gotta water the plants?
[68:21.83]Do I have to water the plants and hurt them?
[68:25.28]If my understanding is correct.
[68:32.18]Oh, you do?
[68:32.62]Okay, you gotta get above them.
[68:39.71]Do I have to put them in the spaces?
[68:41.75]They have to be in those slots.
[68:44.59]It's the same fucking awful music as the other one, too.
[68:46.77]Alright, anyway, I got it.
[68:51.55]I can't, yeah, the music's gonna hurt my head.
[68:52.83]I gotta turn this off.
[68:54.80]I can't fucking do that.
[68:56.06]No way.
[69:00.84]Disinfection?
[69:01.84]No, I already did these.
[69:05.30]Jumping kid.
[69:07.18]Jig chick.
[69:09.33]I think at this point in the stream, it's time just to pick ones that look good.
[69:13.13]Because we have this 220.
[69:16.93]This sound is making my headache work.
[69:19.23]I don't have long fucking nails.
[69:21.52]My nails are perfectly normal human length.
[69:26.05]Alright, how about, uh, let's... Jumping Kid or Jumping Weld?
[69:30.29]Alright, Jumping Weld.
[69:35.15]That is to collect the bells?
[69:49.24]I think.
[69:49.60]Nope.
[69:57.90]The battery life is pretty good.
[69:59.14]This has been over an hour of this.
[70:01.08]And this thing's still going.
[70:05.58]I wonder how long the battery life is.
[70:07.06]Alright, knocking.
[70:10.08]Knock it.
[70:14.01]You have to charge it?
[70:14.79]No, this is just three AAA batteries.
[70:16.61]This thing might die in like five minutes.
[70:17.99]I have no idea.
[70:19.37]Man in red.
[70:20.49]Is it gonna guitar?
[70:21.21]This one.
[70:30.01]Just contra.
[70:31.74]You can only shoot in the air, though.
[70:41.12]I mean, you guys, uh, I mean, people are talking a lot of shit right now, but your little brother would love this, and you don't even have to worry about it.
[70:49.39]You know, oh, what about, he might break it.
[70:51.19]Who cares?
[70:52.00]Good.
[70:53.10]That's not a problem at all.
[70:56.05]Oh no, little Timmy wants to play with mom's iPhone.
[70:58.75]No, no, no, give him the fucking Game Review portable.
[71:02.79]He can destroy it if all that matters.
[71:07.40]These little, tiny little games, they're fine.
[71:10.52]They don't even know they're playing a game anyways.
[71:12.22]They just sit there and go like this.
[71:15.90]And the colors will make them happy, and you don't have to worry about somebody breaking your iPad.
[71:21.02]Christmas, your stocking stuffer is already taken care of.
[71:28.80]Get it at the central.
[71:32.74]What does CVS stand for?
[71:40.27]Community something service.
[71:42.95]What does CVS mean?
[71:48.16]Consumers central vaccine system.
[71:52.30]Convenience value service.
[71:53.88]There it is.
[71:57.16]It's kind of like KFC, isn't it?
[71:58.84]They're not like Kentucky Fried Chicken anymore.
[72:00.52]They're just KFC, right?
[72:01.62]Alright, I'm done with this one.
[72:09.69]Alright, let's see.
[72:10.31]Homing Chicken, Invisible Girl, Man in Red, Knock It.
[72:15.68]What about Jig Chick?
[72:16.80]We have to try.
[72:17.24]It looks like Q-Bert.
[72:23.77]Did it spell it?
[72:25.41]No, okay.
[72:26.25]So it's just Q-Bert.
[72:28.65]Yeah, okay.
[72:29.05]It's Q-Bert with a different name.
[72:30.72]I just jumped off the edge.
[72:33.78]Down.
[72:34.38]Down.
[72:34.62]So this alone is worth the money because it's Q-Bert and you don't have to do anything weird to get Q-Bert again.
[72:52.42]Okay.
[72:54.20]Merry Christmas.
[72:58.19]Mike Pig.
[73:00.47]I think we're going to have to try Mike Pig.
[73:08.35]Can I control that?
[73:14.13]Okay, I thought that was like...
[73:20.73]That was like naked.
[73:21.81]I don't know.
[73:22.55]What do you want me to say?
[73:24.25]How do you play this game?
[73:25.21]This one's just slow.
[73:40.50]Where are the ghosts?
[73:41.28]If you're going to be like a Pac-Man clone, where the hell are the ghosts?
[73:48.11]This guy.
[73:57.22]I beat it.
[73:58.74]Good.

[74:31.68]I might have the most game time on this of anybody on Steam.
[74:34.18]Alright, what is this?
[74:38.50]Do I have to shoot or attack?
[74:44.62]I guess I have to go... There's an arrow pointing over here.
[74:46.70]I don't understand.
[74:53.86]Is it... Do I have to go in the house?
[74:56.21]Do I touch these?
[75:01.51]To catch the rabbit?
[75:02.35]What do I do?
[75:08.68]Has the online.

[131:27.09]So we're going to play L.A.
[131:27.93]Noire.
[131:29.61]Maybe after that we might... I might play this cool little handheld that I got the other day.

[131:45.54]I might take the piss to this thing.

[132:11.35]If you don't show up on the turn off my internet stream, there are two major streams that are planned for next week.
[132:20.16]One of them is the green screen and the other one is, why don't we just say it's the ASMR stream.
[132:26.38]I'm going to be doing an ASMR stream.
[132:28.30]I've learned a lot about it.
[132:32.00]I think I'm very capable of doing it.
[132:34.52]It's going to be on location.
[132:35.42]I want to have a nice space.
[132:37.08]And we're going to get you guys some all kinds of tingles and all kinds of, you know, your brain's going to be going like, you'll feel a little lightness up there.
[132:45.64]So that's going to happen at the end of next week, right before I leave.
[132:50.91]But anyways, thank you for watching.
[132:54.71]Sorry for the terrible fucking stream.
[133:01.94]No, it wasn't.
[133:02.34]It was good.
[133:02.90]I had a fun time, and that was a fun fucking product, and you should get it for your fucking nephew for Halloween or Christmas.
[133:08.70]You know what?
[133:09.28]Fuck that.
[133:10.27]Fuck this.
[133:11.27]I'm going to buy 50 of these, and I'm going to put it in people's trick-or-treat bags.
[133:16.09]Huh?
[133:17.37]What if you got one of those?
[133:23.25]Guys giving out game consoles down the street.
[133:29.70]You think I'm not going to do that?
[133:34.18]You'd egg my house?
[133:35.08]No, you wouldn't.
[133:35.76]You would open this and be like, what the fuck?
[133:38.64]That's not a candy bar.
[133:42.10]You wouldn't do this.
[133:42.78]I'm all out of whack right now, guys, okay?
[133:48.64]I'm all out of whack.
[133:53.07]What the fuck?
[133:53.63]What have I done here?

[133:59.33]Wait a minute.

[134:02.86]I feel like I'm about, I'm like filming a fucking movie.
[134:06.78]Yeah, man, we really like had to cut costs.
[134:08.86]So this is like the camera.
[134:10.70]There's like the boom mic.
[134:12.96]Alright.

[134:24.09]Anyways, almost done.
[134:26.65]Not much longer guys.
[134:29.32]And with that, why am I so much closer today into the camera?
[134:31.34]Oh, it's because this thing sucks.
[134:33.20]I forgot.
[134:33.52]I had to get another one.
[134:36.92]It's a high school setup.
[134:38.22]It really is.
[134:43.07]Anyways, we're going to do the credits.

[147:08.05]Thanks.
[147:09.95]Thank you.
[147:12.75]Just wanted to... Like, I told you this, like, a week or two ago.
[147:16.61]I don't want to just disappear, right?
[147:19.66]If I'm able to and I can just jump on for a few hours, that's kind of, that's what I want to do, you know?

[147:30.81]See you in Vegas.
[147:31.49]I'll turn the stream on in like two weeks.
[147:35.57]But it is what it is.
[147:37.33]I had fun.
[147:39.73]I had a good time.
[147:42.39]It was actually more fun watching people hate this stream.
[147:47.19]But I hated it too.

[147:56.24]No, I liked this thing.
[147:58.36]I didn't hate this thing.
[148:00.28]I hated this thing, not the stream.
[148:04.80]I'm... It's time.
[148:10.59]It's like a taser.
[148:12.17]Like...
[148:15.52]I hated every minute of it.
[148:16.62]No, I liked every second of this stream.
[148:18.84]I just didn't like this thing.
[148:20.10]I thought it was going to be more... I can't flush it down the toilet.
[148:25.57]I got to fucking sell this place.
[148:27.69]I already did.
[148:29.73]I can't do that.
[148:34.99]Looks like a pager.
[148:38.54]Where did everything just go?

[149:53.76]It's great, though.
[149:55.68]He's lost it.
[149:56.28]He can't even remember Odin.
[149:59.82]Look at my eyes.
[150:00.42]My eyes are like all red.
[150:02.36]Look at this.
[150:06.94]That looks fucked up.

[150:57.54]You're correct.
[150:58.28]It's still here.
[151:01.14]It doesn't matter.

[152:10.19]No, I didn't buy it.
[152:10.69]I didn't have an Ouya.
[152:11.39]It was a Kickstarter.
[152:18.06]You got it, like, shipped to you six years late.
[152:23.48]I have an Ouya.
[152:24.28]You have a mobile Ouya.

[153:07.49]Can't think of a better birthday gift than a Jerma stream.
[153:09.89]Hope you had a good time.
[153:11.65]Thank you.
[153:13.55]Darkstar, 700,000 games.
[153:16.61]There, you changed your name.
[153:19.67]You made your name longer.
[153:23.29]Darkstar, 700,000 games.
[153:26.35]Thanks for the $1.
[153:27.07]As you can see, I changed my name, so anytime I give you bits, you can be reminded of the world's best PC game.
[153:33.11]That's true.
[153:34.65]You're right.
[153:34.95]That's a pretty great name.
[153:37.80]Also, I made a non-wasp related video.
[153:39.80]If you don't have time to watch it at the end of the stream, I understand.
[153:42.12]We got time.
[154:04.43]The reason Jerma's moving to Vegas.
[154:06.72]Get in this room.
[154:08.04]What's wrong, sir?
[154:09.16]What's wrong?
[154:09.86]What's wrong?
[154:10.68]You piece of crap.
[154:11.78]What?
[154:12.02]I called you 15 seconds ago.
[154:13.56]Might be even 20.
[154:14.80]And it took you this long?
[154:15.90]I'm so sorry, sir.
[154:16.46]Get that fucking door open.
[154:17.90]I'm so sorry.
[154:18.40]Here you go, sir.
[154:19.70]Here.
[154:20.02]Hey, you know what?
[154:20.82]Next time you're late like that, the next... Conor's a real bitch.
[154:23.90]You do something like that again, you embarrass me like that in front of all these 55 million people, you're fired.
[154:30.18]I'm so sorry, sir.
[154:30.88]Oh, shit.
[154:31.20]Oh, shit.
[154:38.43]oh
[155:07.37]That was fucking great.
[155:11.49]You were fucking... The clicks were great.
[155:16.84]You know, you're right.
[155:17.60]That is one of the reasons why I'm moving to Las Vegas.
[155:19.68]You are correct.
[155:23.88]What's going on with this?
[155:24.72]I keep like... Sorry about that.
[155:29.17]There's something on there.
[155:30.81]I just bought that today.
[155:33.77]Stop touching me.
[155:34.97]Don't touch me.
[155:38.75]Look, it might be a greasy camera because I put my finger... Whatever.
[155:41.09]It's not greasy.
[155:43.89]Thank you, Darkstar, for that awesome video.
[155:48.23]Innocentians.
[155:49.37]Innocent Lions.
[155:51.23]Thank you for the $10, Innocent Lions.
[155:53.14]New to Twitch and have to watch VODs as I'm a UK boy.
[155:56.56]Just want to say I've literally never laughed as much as when I watch you.
[156:01.74]Thank you for being so funny.
[156:05.58]Thank you.
[156:07.44]I'm glad you have a good time.
[156:10.66]All I care about is if people are having fun, and if you're not, then I need to do better.
[156:15.98]Thank you for the $10 and the incredibly nice matches.
[156:18.43]Thank you so much.
[156:21.55]I hope you have fun.
[156:23.69]Hey, Smelly Boy, thanks for the $1.
[156:25.59]Witch Fingers.
[156:30.03]What are you talking about?
[156:32.92]These are not witch fingers.
[156:34.42]They're normal.
[156:35.80]Why is my hands fine?
[156:37.40]What's wrong with my hand?
[156:40.64]Thank you.
[156:42.34]Slide 161.
[156:43.18]Thanks for the $1.
[156:43.54]Hey, Jerma.
[156:44.20]It's been a long time since I've seen a stream.
[156:45.91]My ears hurt from this mic.
[156:47.23]You're blowing out the speakers.
[156:48.37]Help me.
[156:50.99]There's only like one or two more streams with this microphone, so don't worry.
[156:56.15]Not much longer and we can be done.
[156:59.80]Thank you, Mostly Lost, for the $1.
[157:01.26]You can literally sell your ass in Nevada.
[157:10.63]Thank you, Snooze and Copter, for the $1.
[157:13.49]Uh, rewatching the Demon's Souls streams currently, and do you remember when I gave you that letter, and I had three game recommendations on it?
[157:19.85]One was Xenoclash, because when I saw it, I thought this game was made for Jerma, but I never saw you mention it.
[157:25.46]And I almost thought, hmm, so he doesn't like the game after all.
[157:28.16]But then in the Demon's Souls stream, I heard you talk about it, and I knew it.
[157:31.68]I knew you already played it way before.
[157:33.88]You did, right?
[157:35.33]Yeah, Xenoclash 2 came out and I played maybe like an hour of that game.
[157:42.29]I think me and Star played that game.
[157:44.71]Because it was co-op.
[157:46.07]But I played Xenoclash 1.
[157:48.75]Right when it came out, pretty much.
[157:51.13]I thought it was a lot of fun.
[157:52.89]But I don't like to stream games or content or whatever of stuff that I've already done.
[157:58.07]That's the reason why I play so much.
[158:00.69]It would just be me doing something I've already done.
[158:04.52]So I'd rather do stuff that I've never seen before and never done before.
[158:08.06]Because then it's a genuine, obvious, you know, obviously it's not a fake or canned reaction to something that I've never seen.
[158:16.79]Like, oh yeah, I've done that already, but, you know, I guess you're seeing me do it already.
[158:25.13]But am I going to do Sekiro?
[158:26.21]Absolutely.
[158:27.83]Of course.
[158:30.25]I'm going to be late?
[158:30.81]No, I'm fine.
[158:32.05]I'm keeping an eye on the clock.
[158:32.85]We only have, like, two more bits anyway, so we're good.
[158:36.35]Uh, thank you, Lazy Luke, for the $1.
[158:38.17]Handsome streamer.
[158:38.86]Holy shit.
[158:40.80]Hey.
[158:42.72]Hold on, how do you wink?
[158:44.36]Like this.
[158:44.70]Hey, you think I'm a pretty handsome guy, huh?
[158:50.17]Thanks, man.
[158:50.65]Ding.
[158:54.37]Uh, Spellyboy, thanks for the $1.
[158:55.69]Hey, Jerma.
[158:56.43]Uh...
[158:58.01]Alex Jones called me after that whole refusing to play Fortnite with him thing, and he was really upset.
[159:02.07]Alright, thanks, man.
[159:06.85]Thank you.
[159:11.20]Appreciate it.
[159:13.50]Let's also do one more little thing here.
[159:16.38]A couple people came in right after that.
[159:24.84]Let's see, where is it?
[159:30.81]That's not correct.
[159:34.09]Uh-oh.
[159:43.65]No, that's not right.
[159:50.91]I've got to refresh the page.
[159:55.29]I think I screwed something up here.
[160:01.96]The last one hour, let's do, because some people came in right now.
[160:15.23]Let me just double check and make sure I didn't miss anything.
[160:18.17]He looks so sad.
[160:19.09]I'm not sad at all.
[160:19.91]I'm very happy, actually.
[160:22.21]I am very, very happy.
[160:23.33]Alright, here we go.
[160:23.77]I got it here.
[160:25.63]I'm incredibly happy.
[160:26.63]I'm going to be gone soon.
[160:28.95]I'm going to be in Vegas.
[160:30.25]I'm just very, very tired.
[160:32.46]That's all.
[160:34.64]So let's do the rest of these.
[160:36.04]We're going to have to do fairly quickly because I do have to get out of here.
[160:37.82]I have an appointment in less than 30 minutes now.
[160:40.72]So it takes about 10 minutes to get there.
[160:42.04]So I got to go.
[160:43.62]But thank you to... Where did we leave off here?
[160:53.81]Thank you, eDragon, for the $5.
[160:55.11]Was this better than 700,000 games?
[160:56.89]No, that's one of the best PC games ever made.
[160:58.31]So sorry.
[161:01.87]Silverflame, thanks for the $1.
[161:02.83]What do you mean?

[168:40.70]Didn't touch the console, though, by the way.
[168:42.84]I was presenting you guys as a baby.
[168:46.16]Imagine me as, like, a dad, right?
[168:47.88]Like, I'm dad, and this is you.
[168:49.84]You're the baby, right?
[168:50.80]Here we go.

[168:58.10]You're so beautiful to me.
[169:01.35]That's right.
[169:01.99]Oh, are you having a little burpee there?
[169:04.27]Of course you are.
[169:06.91]Hush, little baby, don't say a word.
[169:10.23]Dad is going to make you a mockingbird.
[169:15.18]If that mockingbird don't sing, dad is going to fly you a dive.
