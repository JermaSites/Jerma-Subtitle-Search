[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.12]Hello, everybody.
[00:01.76]I've been away for a little while.
[00:06.40]Just returned.
[00:06.98]I had a nice, entertaining four days.
[00:13.85]I got to hang out with a close friend.
[00:19.89]It was very, very, very cool.
[00:22.72]It's the first time I've seen anybody from back in Massachusetts in almost six months.
[00:29.05]So that was, it was great.
[00:34.41]And I have, since the last four days, have developed a cough.
[00:40.43]Kim got sick.
[00:42.05]She got a cough, a cold, and passed it along to me.
[00:46.19]So I'm gonna have to be muting.
[00:48.01]It's not bad, I'm fine.
[00:49.95]But I'm gonna have to mute every so often to cough into a tissue.
[00:56.60]So.
[00:59.12]Quarantine him already, yeah.
[01:01.96]But hopefully you guys have been doing well.
[01:05.79]You are going to see another one of these four to plus day breaks again.
[01:13.39]Sooner than you think.
[01:14.15]And I'm sorry that these are kind of all compound on top of each other.
[01:17.83]But apparently like spring is the time to come visit me.
[01:21.83]My mother is coming up to visit as well.
[01:25.71]But that's not until, that's not like another month.
[01:29.17]But still, I'll be taking another probably four or five days off when mom comes up.
[01:35.32]So I just want to make you aware of that now.
[01:37.86]Speaking of other things to plan and get ready for.
[01:42.39]What's tomorrow?
[01:44.25]Something going on tomorrow, right?
[01:46.37]A video game that I've been looking forward to for years by a company whose video games I've played for years.
[01:54.64]And I'm talking all the way back to the original King's Field.
[01:57.96]I beat that game.
[01:59.16]I don't even talk about that.
[02:03.22]But, Sekiro comes out tomorrow.
[02:05.36]And yes, I know that there's like 200 million people watching it right now on streams.
[02:10.95]But I don't have access to the game.
[02:12.65]I don't have like a... an early deal or something.
[02:16.55]So... I'm just gonna get it.
[02:18.21]I'm gonna play it when it comes out.
[02:23.62]It's already preloaded, sitting in my Steam inventory.
[02:26.86]Inventory?
[02:28.32]Inventory.
[02:29.52]Inventory.
[02:33.34]It's going to be an amazing, horrible time for you.
[02:35.10]Sorry in advance.
[02:36.84]I'm looking forward to it.
[02:37.86]I love, and this is the best part about a brand new FromSoftware game.
[02:42.36]Everybody in the chat is, you can't talk shit to me.
[02:45.17]You can't.
[02:46.15]Because you don't know either.
[02:46.97]You know, there's no Wikipedia page with like 5,000 articles about, oh, this is the best thing to do.
[02:52.55]This is where you go here.
[02:53.65]Nope.
[02:54.75]Nobody has any idea.
[02:55.60]You're going to be just as lost as I am.
[02:58.80]I love it.
[03:02.17]I don't have to know in order to talk shit.
[03:13.36]That's true.
[03:14.22]That's true.
[03:14.62]You are correct.
[03:17.50]He's dying.
[03:18.18]No, I told you.
[03:18.76]I got a cough.
[03:20.12]It's just annoying.
[03:21.52]It doesn't hurt or anything.
[03:25.20]But, so I'm going to give you a plan.
[03:26.68]Let's go over the plan of action here.
[03:30.08]So today, we're going to play this game called We the Revolution.
[03:35.77]It's a game that was inspired by Papers, Please.
[03:39.71]It's a game where you're a judge, and you're presented with cases, and you either send people to the guillotine, you acquit them, or you put them in jail.
[03:52.67]And you gotta be careful because there's a lot of crazy shit that can happen.
[03:58.27]Fighting in nations and political powers rising.
[04:02.23]It looked interesting just to play.
[04:03.99]Because I didn't want to start something elaborate.
[04:07.45]Because tomorrow, I'm gonna be streaming all day.
[04:09.99]Tomorrow, Saturday, Sunday, I'm gonna play that game a shitload.
[04:15.96]So I figured let's just do something for a little while so I can prepare my body for the inevitable like 30 plus hours of streaming I'm gonna do over the next like two and a half days, right?
[04:33.25]After Sekiro.
[04:35.36]When Sekiro is done, or maybe even to take a break from Sekiro, Monster Rancher 4 is the next thing.
[04:44.78]Because I want to go back to play it.
[04:45.80]I want to play Monster Rancher 2.
[04:48.06]Monster Rancher 4 was when we didn't try.
[04:52.40]And that's what's going to happen later on this coming week.
[04:58.76]There's also other collaborative things, collabs with other people, that are still kind of floating around.
[05:06.53]Maybe we'll get a new beanbag Sonic.
[05:08.11]Possibly, yeah.
[05:10.10]But, uh, for now, for today, we're just gonna chill.
[05:14.74]I just got back.
[05:15.38]I have to be completely honest.
[05:17.74]I didn't really look at anything.
[05:18.84]I haven't been planning any streams or anything for the last four days.
[05:22.12]I've just been hanging out with, uh, friends.
[05:24.78]So, I kinda just had, uh, what am I gonna do today, right?
[05:27.58]This is what we're gonna do.
[05:31.88]Let's go ahead and open it up.
[05:33.86]Again, this is called We The Revolution.
[05:38.81]And there it is on your screen.
[05:43.25]Do a collab with Quaker Oatman.
[05:47.25]The guy on the cereal box?
[05:53.32]You're talking about George Washington, right?
[05:56.30]I thought that was George Washington for the first 30 years of my life.
[06:01.10]It is George Washington, isn't it?
[06:04.34]Is it?
[06:05.38]Who is on the front of the Quaker Oats?
[06:10.72]Wait, no, no, no, for real.
[06:14.14]Who... Who's on the Quaker Oats box?
[06:22.90]The Quaker man is not an actual person.
[06:25.78]His image is that of a man dressed in the Quaker garb, chosen because of the Quaker faith.
[06:30.77]Wait, that's not supposed to be George Washington.
[06:35.95]Well, I knew it wasn't George Washington.
[06:37.39]I just wanted to make sure you knew.
[06:40.13]I gotta turn this down.
[06:43.39]This is loud.
[06:44.47]No, I knew it wasn't George Washington.
[06:49.82]I'm just fucking around.
[06:50.48]Alright, new profile.
[06:52.58]This game just came out today.
[06:54.52]So, we're gonna give it a check.
[06:55.50]You know, Steam review.
[06:57.44]Let's see.
[07:08.38]Let's just make sure this is correct.
[07:10.24]Full screen, yeah.
[07:11.14]Yeah, let's get a tutorial just because we don't know what the hell we're doing.
[07:14.49]Game options, audio.
[07:17.95]I always hate having music.
[07:19.25]That's something I gotta tell.
[07:20.05]I gotta give some developers a little bit of, uh, audio lessons here.
[07:24.28]You know, I'm the master of audio.
[07:27.04]Don't have music be the same volume percentage as sound and voice.
[07:31.06]This should always be like 30% lower.
[07:34.73]How many trailers have you ever watched where the music was the same volume as people talking?
[07:41.01]Music is supposed to be in the background, not in the foreground.
[07:45.43]Some people even do it like this.
[07:47.30]That's wrong.
[07:50.62]If you have people talking and sound effects, you want the music to be at a decibel much lower because you can hear them talking.
[07:58.12]No wonder he didn't like Doom.
[08:03.36]I liked Doom.
[08:04.15]What did I give Doom?
[08:06.45]That's better.
[08:07.31]Okay, see, maybe even a little lower, like 47.
[08:08.79]Why did it go to 0?
[08:13.91]What?
[08:14.85]Oh, it didn't.
[08:15.47]Okay.
[08:15.91]The song ended.
[08:20.87]Okay.
[08:26.15]We the Revolution.
[08:28.75]This is like Ace Attorney.
[08:29.79]Just imagine playing Ace Attorney.
[08:31.09]For all of you Ace Attorney fans.
[08:33.53]I wonder if I'm gonna have to do any voice acting.
[08:36.23]Let's see if I can do some voice acting.
[08:38.13]Oh, no.
[08:38.43]They're gonna be way better than me.
[08:39.48]Never mind.
[08:39.82]I'll just be quiet.
[08:44.72]I am here.
[08:50.78]Do you hear me?
[08:51.54]I gave you the best I could.
[09:01.89]It's Andross.
[09:09.71]Why did you disown me?
[09:18.82]I have your blood in my veins.
[09:22.03]How could you?
[09:24.09]This takes place in the French Revolution, if you didn't know.
[09:31.15]Do I mean nothing to you?
[09:32.73]You play as Jean-Paul Gosseau.
[09:35.53]You used to own a marine tank.
[09:38.26]Why did you grieve for him?
[09:41.08]He was nothing.
[09:47.42]I am better than he was.
[09:49.72]People will follow in my footsteps.
[09:53.84]I know this actor.
[09:56.34]Father.
[10:01.24]Who is this?
[10:03.71]That, like, people will follow in my footsteps.
[10:05.73]Like, I've heard it before.
[10:07.73]Music's too quiet.
[10:08.57]I can't hear.
[10:11.35]The game is louder than me.
[10:12.71]France, turn off the 18th century.
[10:16.35]Turn off the 18th century.
[10:17.37]Prologue.
[10:20.91]I hope this is a fucking musical.
[10:24.52]Everything from France is a musical.
[10:26.16]It has to be.
[10:30.06]Every piece of media, every TV show, every film,
[10:43.60]Is he about to puke too?
[10:48.48]Is that me?
[10:54.89]Alright, so now I get to talk.
[10:56.09]Remind me next time I want to stop drinking this cloudy rotgut.
[11:00.27]Remind me before I drink it.
[11:02.59]We're disgracing Temmis.
[11:04.09]Ha!
[11:04.81]Is someone coming?
[11:10.94]This was bound to happen.
[11:13.86]I told you.
[11:15.82]Papa, you said we would go.
[11:17.65]You promised.
[11:20.13]Papa had a lot of work.
[11:22.89]Yes, a lot of heavy glasses.
[11:25.35]You promised me.
[11:26.61]I can't anymore.
[11:27.43]I'm fed up with asking.
[11:29.47]Mama is angry because... Quiet!
[11:32.52]Today it's hard to do four people at the same time.
[11:35.50]Okay?
[11:38.92]All different ages and...
[11:42.32]Today, your favorite son wanted to prove he was more honorable than his father.
[11:46.20]So he started a fight.
[11:48.02]A five-year-old boy, for God's sake.
[11:51.37]Our neighbors wanted you to explain that to them, but well, you were fighting for justice.
[11:56.53]At an inn, damn you, you bloody drunk.
[12:00.07]Mother.
[12:05.12]Is this kid on trial?
[12:06.40]Oh, this is like a trial.
[12:08.80]Okay, hold on.
[12:11.38]Drag and drop documents to manage their layout.
[12:13.78]Click to display their contents.
[12:16.96]React to events.
[12:18.14]Ignoring them may have severe consequences.
[12:22.24]Okay, so that's events.
[12:23.58]Documents.
[12:25.02]Review detailed information about current events, actions, and characters.
[12:31.28]Okay.
[12:31.70]Consider the effects and decide the defendant's fate.
[12:35.70]And you can change the settings from here.
[12:37.92]Review the current balance of power in Paris and your position therein.
[12:42.73]So that's the balance of power.
[12:44.67]Intrigues are complex conflicts between you and another political player.
[12:48.63]A defeat may turn out to be disastrous for you.
[12:52.83]This is how many influence points I have.
[12:55.03]Of the main currency in the game, use them wisely.
[12:59.53]And then we got like a Sims notification field.
[13:01.47]Take close attention to the changes in your influence and relations with factions.
[13:06.45]Okay.
[13:07.97]Some of your decisions and changes in the world of the game may cause global modifiers to come into effect.
[13:13.63]These factors affect relations, reputation, and influence.
[13:18.32]You can review them in the notebook.
[13:21.62]Alright, so... Guilty.
[13:25.26]No.
[13:25.60]Punishment.
[13:26.08]Make the most important decision.
[13:28.08]Condemn the defendant or deem them not guilty.
[13:32.30]Sign the document to legitimize your verdict.
[13:36.42]Okay, so choose a verdict.
[13:38.38]What if I just say you're guilty?
[13:40.08]I'm dead, right?
[13:40.94]Alright, so here we go.
[13:43.22]Case file.
[13:44.90]Review charges and facts.
[13:46.09]This will make it easier for you to unlock questions for the defendant.
[13:50.41]Okay, so review charges and facts.
[13:54.05]But where are these the facts?
[13:59.31]Alright, so case file.
[14:00.79]This is an assault.
[14:04.20]Skip this?
[14:04.82]I'm not going to skip this.
[14:06.32]I have to, what am I going to go off of like how I feel?
[14:11.24]We have not expected this kind of behavior from your son, although apparently we should have.
[14:16.14]Innocent child's play turned into an assault on our children.
[14:20.90]The younger one, Antoine, now has a chipped front tooth.
[14:26.69]We hope that you will punish your child accordingly.
[14:29.35]Should the situation repeat itself, we will react more decisively.
[14:33.71]I am sure we can deal with the gambler and drunkard, even if he is a judge.
[14:37.62]We will not let our children be hurt.
[14:40.68]Okay.
[14:42.04]Can I click these?
[14:43.66]We should have.
[14:44.14]An innocent child's play turned into an assault.
[14:47.11]Innocent.
[14:48.07]Finding links.
[14:50.97]I'm not gonna put my son to the guillotine.
[14:53.44]Find the correct links to unlock questions for the defendant.
[14:55.94]Choose a line of inquiry and link it to the right category.
[15:01.09]Okay.
[15:02.11]What the fuck?
[15:04.53]While linking lines of inquiry in categories, you can make a limited number of mistakes.
[15:09.39]If you make too many mistakes, the whole system will become locked.
[15:14.67]Oh, God.
[15:18.16]And there are traps here, too?
[15:21.90]Some cases may contain traps.
[15:23.36]Read through the files thoroughly to find the lines of inquiry that are irrelevant.
[15:28.86]Okay, so, child's play... I thought that just said eating children.
[15:34.73]I was like, where did that come from?
[15:38.05]Alright, wait, wait, go back, go back, go back.
[15:40.19]Course of events.
[15:42.55]Wait, wait, hold on, let me look at this.
[15:44.77]So, innocent child's play turned into an assault.
[15:48.48]The younger one.
[15:49.74]So, Antoine has a chipped front tooth.
[15:51.82]So, innocent child's play turned into a chipped front tooth.
[15:57.70]Should the situation repeat itself, we will react more.
[16:01.18]So, okay.
[16:01.54]Innocent child's play into a front tooth being chipped.
[16:05.92]Okay, so let's... Let's take a look.
[16:09.87]Child's play.
[16:12.45]To... Alright, so we've got... Course of events.
[16:19.62]In... Exten... Victim?
[16:25.20]Wait, I'm... This isn't a Jerma game.
[16:30.11]Yes, it is.
[16:30.63]Alright, this is the victim.
[16:34.27]Fighting children is the extenuating circumstance.
[16:37.29]No, no, no.
[16:37.71]Chipped tooth is the extenuating circumstance.
[16:43.91]Oh, fuck.
[16:51.93]It's alright, we have a question.
[16:52.77]Hold on.
[16:54.07]Gather information to influence the jury's attitude.
[16:56.05]Like, why is there a jury here?
[16:57.35]Why am I bringing this... This is what happens when you have a dad judge.
[17:01.23]Alright?
[17:04.33]This is the embarrassing shit that you have to go through.
[17:08.97]What exactly were they saying?
[17:10.07]Okay.
[17:10.53]Who started the fight?
[17:12.63]To ask questions, you have to first unlock them in the inquiry linking menu.
[17:15.29]Okay.
[17:16.11]Being in the jury's good graces allows you to find out which way they will sway after you have asked a question.
[17:23.15]Okay.
[17:25.31]So you can sway juries.
[17:26.53]No, no, hold on, let me go back to this.
[17:29.63]So, injured Anton.
[17:32.61]So we've got possibility of repeating, we've got fighting children.
[17:38.10]Is the, that's the course of events.
[17:40.44]Okay.
[17:41.34]Chipped tooth is also the course of events.
[17:44.14]Alright, that's, I get it.
[17:46.56]Alright, what's my son's name?
[17:50.51]How did your play turn into a fight?
[17:52.47]That makes sense.
[17:54.50]How did your play turn into a fight?
[17:57.58]Our neighbors, Antoine and Jean, they were saying mean things about you.
[18:01.74]We were playing guards and they asked me to pretend to be a drunkard whom they would, you know.
[18:07.23]You were fighting both of them at once?
[18:09.85]I had to.
[18:12.47]Alright, so they were making fun of me and then he started fighting two people at the same time.
[18:18.46]Alright, who started this fight?
[18:19.86]Did you start it, or did somebody throw a rock at you?
[18:22.06]Who started the fight?
[18:24.79]I can tell you who ended it.
[18:28.25]He doesn't have a bruise or anything.
[18:29.73]Oh, he did.
[18:31.05]I think it was me.
[18:33.15]I kicked the one on the left and then wanted to get the one on the right, but they ended it.
[18:39.94]They knocked me to the ground and paid me back for hitting them.
[18:45.67]Okay, so they made fun of me, and then you kicked one of them.
[18:53.85]Okay, did you really break Antoine's tooth?
[18:59.56]This is a really noisy courtroom with nobody being here, yeah.
[19:03.30]Frederick is just a child.
[19:05.44]I don't know.
[19:06.00]I don't think so.
[19:07.05]I don't think I broke his tooth.
[19:09.19]Did you hit him in the face?
[19:10.87]I think I kicked him, but not that hard.
[19:13.65]Okay, but in the face.
[19:16.05]Did you kick him in the face?
[19:22.31]What were they saying?
[19:25.19]Are you too drunk to guess?
[19:26.66]Who is this person?
[19:28.30]Can I contempt of court this person out of here?
[19:33.35]That's not asking you.
[19:34.59]They were yelling that you are, well, I told them that it's not true.
[19:38.05]And they started calling me names.
[19:39.17]They called me a drunkard's son.
[19:42.49]Okay.
[19:44.69]So let me look at this one more time.
[19:46.79]The young one now has a chipped front tooth.
[19:49.32]He probably fell down.
[19:50.06]Let me look at this shit.
[19:54.56]Negative relations with factions mean negative consequences for you.
[19:59.22]a.k.a.
[20:00.50]the fervor in Paris rising.
[20:02.94]So this is my relations.
[20:06.36]There are factions.
[20:07.16]Yeah, reputation.
[20:08.22]Reputation impacts everything in the world of the game.
[20:11.24]Factions, family relations, the audience's attitude.
[20:14.04]That's you.
[20:14.46]That's you guys.
[20:16.80]The fervor in the sections and even the ability to persuade other characters.
[20:22.08]You have a set amount of influence points per day.
[20:24.18]In the future you will be able to increase this limit.
[20:28.29]Alright, so how many death penalties do I have?
[20:30.20]Zero.
[20:32.00]So this is the common folk.
[20:33.00]This is how the common folk feel about me.
[20:34.36]This is how the revolutionaries feel about me.
[20:38.58]This is my reputation.
[20:39.38]It's pretty much right in the middle.
[20:41.77]Okay, this is good to know.
[20:43.17]What's this?
[20:44.81]Events.
[20:46.61]Here you'll find, okay, this is information about events.
[20:48.87]And then this last one is people and family and... Okay, you can see detailed info.
[20:54.66]So this is my wife.
[20:56.69]This is my oldest son.
[20:58.65]No, it's not.
[21:00.45]Yes.
[21:00.85]This is my oldest son.
[21:01.85]This is my youngest son.
[21:03.05]I have my dad.
[21:05.26]And then my mentor.
[21:08.98]Got it.
[21:09.84]So this is all family in here.
[21:13.08]Alright.
[21:14.90]So.
[21:16.37]Let's look at the hierarchy for a second.
[21:20.53]This is me.
[21:22.50]A judge of the Revolutionary Tribunal, generally considered drunkard and gambler.
[21:26.62]A protege of Raymond Devoy, who introduced him to the world of law and regulations.
[21:31.12]In private, he is an unremarkable character.
[21:34.93]Well, just wait till I make it up to, like, top 1,000 streamer.
[21:42.55]In Vegas.
[21:44.03]Alright, so let me get this straight.
[21:46.89]He started the fight...
[21:48.85]If somebody calls you names, you just tell them to shut the fuck up, okay?
[21:55.01]You can't, like, attack somebody.
[21:56.44]That's guilty.
[22:02.38]You say, leave me alone.
[22:03.40]You say, oh, well, my dad's a judge.
[22:13.73]What is this?
[22:16.06]Make your decision.
[22:16.90]Each action may require a different number of influence points and have a different chance of success.
[22:21.24]Consider them carefully.
[22:24.06]Intimidate parents.
[22:29.55]We can go right to evil if you want.
[22:32.67]Your addictions are no longer a secret.
[22:34.53]The fact that other children are bullying your son because of them is a minor problem.
[22:39.61]But who is spreading those rumors?
[22:41.83]It is likely to be one of their parents.
[22:44.01]They could have whispered into their children's ears whom they shouldn't play with and why.
[22:48.99]They might even have spiced the story with a lie.
[22:51.05]But who will... But who will hear it next?
[22:59.58]Now I can't just go full on chaotic evil.
[23:02.35]No.
[23:03.07]Let's talk eye to eye.
[23:04.05]This is one influence point.
[23:07.47]Talk eye to eye.
[23:12.95]neighborhood gossip so now what does that do for me now?
[23:30.84]neighborhood gossip yeah I read this already so this is reputation influence
[23:42.25]I mean, I already read this.
[23:45.61]Did that show up in a different place?
[23:50.76]Maybe we'll see later on.
[23:51.68]Because I don't think I can... I think that just means I'm going to talk to them.
[23:57.69]Any other questions?
[23:59.97]No?
[24:00.13]What about you guys?
[24:00.99]Can I interact with anybody here?
[24:07.90]No, I think that just happens at some point later on.
[24:10.63]Because now there's nothing really else to do.
[24:14.91]Verdict form.
[24:17.19]To the gallows.
[24:18.31]No.
[24:22.12]I think... I mean... I found the defendant guilty of the offense which they were charged.
[24:27.86]You kicked somebody.
[24:29.08]I can't... How am I supposed to prove that you didn't?
[24:31.07]Right?
[24:31.31]Here's my signature.
[24:36.71]I'm not going to give my actual signature, because I don't want anyone to have that.
[24:43.22]What's my name?
[24:46.68]I'm scared to even do anything remotely similar.
[24:48.82]How about... Oh.
[24:57.78]There we go.
[24:59.40]I did it.
[24:59.68]Guilty.
[25:00.72]Guilty.
[25:04.32]Unfortunately, you should not start fights regardless of the reason.
[25:10.01]I mean, look, come on.
[25:14.41]Does my son go to prison?
[25:16.31]Those children are so small and they already know the truth.
[25:19.04]The father of my children is a lying drunk and a gambler.
[25:22.60]Bernard used to worship you, but he soon grew up.
[25:25.74]Now it is Frederick's turn to learn the truth that echoes in the streets.
[25:30.77]He's no longer fearing your anger.
[25:32.87]He knows that your threats are empty.
[25:35.03]Frederick is only starting to learn the truth about his father from the streets.
[25:40.19]I was unaware that Matilda had such a temper.
[25:44.67]As was I. We will wait outside, as always.
[25:54.76]Congratulations.
[25:57.64]You passed the first judge exam.
[26:01.52]We were enchanted by the idea of freedom.
[26:16.97]We could not resist it.
[26:18.27]Is that me?
[26:22.25]Or am I taking these pictures?
[26:23.43]Yeah, I'm taking these photos.
[26:25.83]Whole families took to the streets.
[26:27.81]We're on, like, vacation photos.
[26:32.84]France was never so happy.
[26:43.92]We were enchanted by the idea of freedom.
[26:47.46]This is a revolution.
[26:51.10]Yeah, I know it's very loud.
[26:52.16]It's one of those games that's very loud if it's in a cutscene.
[26:57.55]Act 1.
[26:57.83]Alright, here we go.
[27:00.97]Liberty.
[27:01.85]Day 1.
[27:12.88]Okay, here we go.
[27:15.55]So, expected sentence.
[27:18.67]Find out which verdict is expected by the factions and your close ones.
[27:24.90]Okay.
[27:29.96]So, acquittal and prison.
[27:32.38]The common folk and revolutionaries want prison.
[27:35.83]And this is... Nobody.
[27:37.73]Who is it?
[27:42.66]Case file.
[27:45.94]Okay, hold on.
[27:46.48]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[27:47.18]Everybody, hold on a second.
[27:48.02]I need like a minute to get ready.
[27:50.08]There's no timer.
[27:52.61]I can take as long as I want.
[27:53.85]Imagine a judge saying this.
[27:55.73]I can take as long as I want.
[27:56.93]I just, I need to review the case first.
[27:59.65]I might need to get a coffee too.
[28:01.01]Alright, so this is... In difficult times, people like to seek peace at the bottom of a glass.
[28:10.51]Please, introduce yourself.
[28:13.89]My name is Gene Renard, Monsieur Lesus.
[28:18.03]Nothing but a fraud!
[28:21.06]Systematically opposing the opinion of the jury may lead to serious consequences.
[28:27.40]Okay, so everyone wants this guy arrested.
[28:29.09]Let's see what he did.
[28:31.17]Compiled by Richard Monior.
[28:32.89]Fraud.
[28:34.55]Jean Reynard, a 45-year-old innkeeper, has been charged with fraud.
[28:39.13]He is accused of diluting alcohol in his tavern, tricking his clients into paying extra.
[28:46.54]Guests came with their mindset on a specific goal, getting roaring drunk, but instead of staggering out after drinking two pitchers of wine or several pints of beer, they would sit in the inn until morning still sober and completely penniless.
[29:01.72]The innkeeper's fraud came to light when one of the customers discovered the scam and caught the cheater in the act.
[29:08.12]The man entered the host's cellar and witnessed him diluting the alcohol in the barrels with ordinary water.
[29:15.13]As a result, customers received only four parts of what they had paid for and one part from the water carrier.
[29:23.31]So he was diluting alcohol, but alright.
[29:26.43]So let's see.
[29:27.73]So diluting alcohol.
[29:31.35]So the innkeeper.
[29:33.31]Exposing the innkeeper.
[29:34.49]Customer's drunkenness.
[29:35.63]Adding water was the method.
[29:38.75]Okay.
[29:39.35]Diluting alcohol was the method.
[29:44.13]But what about... I need a motive.
[29:45.80]What's going on here?
[29:46.66]Motive for the innkeeper.
[29:49.60]Caught in a trap.
[29:50.36]What does that mean?
[29:50.88]I... What do you mean caught in a trap?
[29:56.10]Did he set a trap?
[30:00.14]I can't ask any more questions.
[30:03.46]What?
[30:07.72]No.
[30:08.00]Customer's drunkenness are the witnesses.
[30:12.30]Oh, fuck.
[30:13.08]Shit.
[30:13.68]Exposing the innkeeper is the motive.
[30:21.38]It's the motive.
[30:23.84]And exposing the innkeeper, we need witnesses, right?
[30:27.15]Okay, we're good.
[30:29.61]Here we go.
[30:32.14]So we have influence on the jury's opinion.
[30:34.26]This is... People are gonna want, like, guillotine.
[30:38.62]Should I just call in the witness?
[30:42.43]People want this guy dead.
[30:46.75]How long you been involved in the illegal practice of diluting alcohol?
[30:49.71]Yeah, that means, like, he... Do your clients drink a lot?
[30:57.92]Okay.
[30:58.96]Please call in Thomas Leclerc to the stands.
[31:05.07]Please introduce yourself.
[31:06.91]Thomas Leclerc.
[31:07.55]I'm the regular Jean Renard's establishment.
[31:12.95]Okay.
[31:16.06]How long have you suspected that something was wrong with the alcohol?
[31:19.90]How did you catch Citizen... How did you catch him in the act?
[31:24.82]How'd you catch him in the act?
[31:27.86]I was having one drink after another, so I had to, you know, I think that means pee.
[31:34.45]So it happened that one time I got lost, and instead of, you know, I ended up in the cellar, where I saw Renard adding water to the barrels.
[31:43.78]Oh, fuck, they want him in prison.
[31:46.38]Alright, so that's a witness testimony.
[31:51.31]Wait, wait, wait.
[31:54.35]Can I tell her, can I like, is it like, where's my gavel?
[31:58.99]Please call it, okay, review the trial's records.
[32:02.47]So I can review what happened previously, alright.
[32:05.99]What about news here?
[32:06.93]Here we go.
[32:08.49]Neighborhood gossip.
[32:10.21]The father had a rare episode of foolishness when he decided to stand up to someone stronger.
[32:14.75]Threatening him with a fist and showing his children they are safe by his side.
[32:19.12]He did not listen to your arguments.
[32:20.86]Furthermore, he gave a precise description of where you can shove them.
[32:24.52]What?
[32:26.58]Why am I getting this right now during a case?
[32:31.19]Like, somebody just slides that on the desk.
[32:33.31]I know you're busy with this case, but somebody... What?
[32:37.35]I don't know, man.
[32:41.81]I might say, fuck this guy.
[32:44.81]Okay, so... Threatening him with a fist and showing his children they're safe by his side.
[32:50.56]He didn't listen to your arguments.
[32:56.62]Okay.
[32:56.78]What are we doing?
[32:57.96]Oh, yeah.
[32:58.32]Like, I'm supposed to be doing a case here.
[33:03.57]I'm hiring thugs not to hurt him.
[33:05.91]They're going to go do the... Two of them are going to go.
[33:07.99]I had two influence points.
[33:08.97]They're going to both raise their fist at him like he did to me.
[33:11.80]And then he's going to hire three thugs and do that to me.
[33:13.70]And we're going to keep going until one of us eventually wins the auction.
[33:19.28]Alright.
[33:19.54]So let's take a look at this again.
[33:20.58]We already know.
[33:22.02]Alright.
[33:22.50]Let me do some more questions probably.
[33:24.08]Let's question them.
[33:26.69]Okay.
[33:26.99]So how did you feel... Do your clients drink a lot?
[33:32.67]Tavern regulars usually drink a lot.
[33:35.42]So you have been selling plenty of wine?
[33:38.10]Quite a lot, yes.
[33:40.26]And yet you have been paying taxes on the amount of wine you've bought, not the amount of wine you've been selling, correct?
[33:48.54]I don't understand.
[33:50.31]You've been paying taxes on four wine barrels, but by adding a quarter of water to each, have actually made the money for selling five barrels of wine.
[34:02.27]Oh, that's one way of putting it, but perhaps it is correct.
[34:05.55]I'm not good with numbers.
[34:07.89]You are not good with numbers, yet good enough to have calculated that fraud pays off.
[34:12.36]I wasn't aware.
[34:14.36]I will take this answer into account.
[34:17.70]The judge has exposed the bastard!
[34:19.68]This guy's an idiot.
[34:24.98]Okay, how long you been involved in the illegal practice of diluting alcohol?
[34:30.86]It's not an illegal practice.
[34:32.62]Everyone adds a little bit.
[34:35.12]In your case, it was a bit of wine in the water, not the other way around.
[34:39.20]Have you been doing this for a long time?
[34:41.36]A few weeks at the most.
[34:42.72]It's been hard to earn a living lately.
[34:45.14]I used to run an honest business.
[34:46.64]Pure wine was over spilling the glasses.
[34:49.82]Is there any proof to support your testimony?
[34:52.56]He lied to his customers.
[34:53.84]No reason he wouldn't lie in court.
[34:57.18]Does he have anything?
[34:58.96]Give me some documents.
[35:00.04]Anything.
[35:08.29]You don't got anything to give me here.
[35:11.07]How did you feel about tricking the citizens?
[35:13.99]Terrible.
[35:14.99]But all I wanted was to keep my business afloat.
[35:17.73]Others don't mess around for sure.
[35:19.63]No diluting would be the end of me.
[35:22.12]So you decided to commit fraud so as not to lose money.
[35:25.66]If I lost my tavern, my family would starve to death.
[35:28.98]Do you have children?
[35:30.66]I do.
[35:31.16]One son and two daughters.
[35:32.22]Time to start saving up for the dowry.
[35:35.66]Then why don't you send them to work?
[35:37.74]Idiot!
[35:40.71]Alright, people, it's, uh, jury's opinion is prison.
[35:43.77]They're getting inflamed here.
[35:49.05]People want him in prison.
[35:50.33]Uh, let me see.
[35:51.25]Yeah.
[35:55.46]Let's take a look.
[35:56.12]What do we got here?
[35:57.18]Choose a verdict to see its influence.
[36:00.94]The jury votes in favor of incarceration.
[36:03.60]The defendant, they find the punishment sufficient.
[36:07.35]Choose a verdict.
[36:07.93]Prison.
[36:08.43]Prison.
[36:10.42]So this would give me a reputation bonus with common folk and with revolutionaries.
[36:17.51]Reputation bonus if you can get up there.
[36:19.03]Okay.
[36:20.95]What about acquittal?
[36:23.39]Go on.
[36:23.87]Go free.
[36:25.39]Just don't do it again.
[36:26.46]Alright.
[36:31.30]I'm sorry, sir, but you've been... I mean, we've got witness testimony.
[36:34.40]We've got your own testimony.
[36:35.54]You're talking about tax fraud.
[36:38.60]You're going to prison.
[36:43.23]Sorry, but that's the way it is.
[36:44.33]Sentence.
[36:44.97]Citizen Jean Renard to prison.
[36:46.47]Lead the condemned out.
[36:48.65]Huzzah.
[36:49.87]Long live pure wine.
[36:53.87]Alright.
[36:56.42]Moving on.
[36:56.86]After trial, click to move on to the next part.
[37:01.16]We're gonna get some big, like, fucking M. Night Shyamalan twist.
[37:07.18]Verdict form.
[37:07.98]Here we go.
[37:14.18]Okay.
[37:15.49]May I remind you that you promised to join me?
[37:17.73]I have a feeling that tonight's moon favors gamblers.
[37:22.65]Though it does not favor spouses.
[37:25.87]God should grace us with wives who understand the importance of an evening game of dice.
[37:30.60]They should also know that the right amount of wine guarantees a lucky roll.
[37:35.28]I should go home.
[37:37.70]Bringing a judge to the game has benefits.
[37:40.02]Other players will surely not cheat.
[37:43.31]That is not a strong argument.
[37:46.07]My name is Jacques-Louis David.
[37:48.24]I am but a humble painter, not a silver-tongued judge.
[37:52.56]You are a sly politician, Jacques.
[37:55.62]As a politician, I understand the importance of keeping promises.
[37:58.55]And you, my friend, are trying to get out of yours.
[38:06.35]Mmm.
[38:09.14]Go out or go home?
[38:11.11]I just got in trouble with my wife for going out.
[38:17.61]Go out.
[38:18.15]But this could be a good political move for me.
[38:27.14]Send thugs.
[38:29.20]Oh my god.
[38:33.32]But what about my career?
[38:34.65]Nah, I'm going to do the right.
[38:36.53]Not tonight, Jay.
[38:41.88]Now he's going to work to undermine me.
[38:52.14]Oh, how boring!
[38:53.18]I could be sitting in that seat right there with my coins.
[38:57.98]Ah, the same cold meatloaf and cold peas and cold potatoes and cold gravy and cold thyme leaves and cold plates.
[39:07.49]And cold eyes staring back at me.
[39:10.37]Angry with me.
[39:19.79]late evening at the judge's house oh what do you not want to berate me like you always do I'm glad you're home are you aware that Frederick sometimes imagines you as a deep sea sailor he dreams that you visit distant countries and have wonderful adventures
[39:47.95]But he would rather have you by his side, on land.
[39:51.93]We all want that.
[39:53.59]I don't want to watch the storm blow your lifeboat away and bury it beneath the waves.
[39:59.32]There are no waves.
[40:01.28]The storm is getting closer.
[40:02.44]Dark clouds already hang over the shore.
[40:05.30]Just wait until they finish building the guillotine.
[40:08.18]Your oars will break at once and the waves will take you to a place you'll soon wish you'd never set foot on.
[40:17.09]A place without us.
[40:25.51]Your family loves you, but we won't find you in the darkness that has already begun to reach for you.
[40:35.71]Relations with family.
[40:37.10]You have to choose an action.
[40:38.66]What?
[40:40.36]Oh, God.
[40:41.00]Upon returning home, you can decide how you would like to spend the rest of the day.
[40:49.86]Each action will affect the other members of the family as well as their attitude towards you.
[40:56.42]okay each character's attitude can provide you with or deprive you of certain bonuses like reputation or relations with factions your youngest son is special his attitude makes the other family members like you slightly more take good care of him okay so hanging out with
[41:21.66]Hanging out with Grandpa gives influence to the people.
[41:25.48]Hanging out with Bernard is influence on the revolutionaries.
[41:28.52]Hanging out with Matilda is influence on reputation and then influence on the family.
[41:35.73]Opening night at the theater.
[41:38.13]There's a new play opening tonight on stage at the Comme des Français.
[41:41.75]It is a good chance to take a breather from reality.
[41:44.91]Political debate.
[41:47.45]It's time for the grown men to talk about the revolution's achievements.
[41:50.30]It should be an interesting exchange.
[41:54.26]Why don't we just all go out to the play?
[41:55.40]Everybody gets to go to the play.
[42:23.34]Playtime with Grandpa.
[42:30.49]Debate the child?
[42:32.81]No, the child is not- it's only these two.
[42:36.67]No, alright, let's involve everybody.
[42:38.35]Let's just hang out with the kids and just have fun.
[42:41.76]We're gonna... Okay.
[42:45.48]Why did you not- oh, your wife's needs can wait.
[42:47.72]Weren't you not involved?
[42:51.16]So that influenced- oh man.
[42:55.50]My god.
[42:58.60]This is just... There's a lot going on here.
[43:04.10]Okay, today the people of Paris commemorate Jacques Guillemin Simon, mayor of Intampis.
[43:11.90]He was lynched by a furious mob for performing his duties to France.
[43:16.79]This march shall symbolize the unity of our society in the hope that the most violent stage of the revolution is past us.
[43:23.39]Let us make sure that no other loyal servant of France becomes a victim of such hatred ever again.
[43:27.89]From King Louis.
[43:30.81]Okay.
[43:36.40]Assuming you was a good loyal officer, those bastards lynched him for observing the law.
[43:40.98]Will you join me at the march?
[43:48.29]We have to show that we oppose the self-appointed executioners and stand alongside.
[43:52.92]I wonder why the king has taken the trouble to show up.
[43:56.12]Louis marching in arm-in-arm with the people of Paris, that is unexpected.
[44:02.87]King Louis!
[44:04.95]Continue, please.
[44:05.89]I am merely an observer.
[44:07.85]Do not change your habits for me.
[44:10.29]I heard a thing or two about a young and ambitious judge at the tribunal.
[44:13.56]I was curious as to he guided by justice or by entertainment.
[44:18.08]As some would say.
[44:18.92]Oh.
[44:23.16]We got... This is Defton Burglar.
[44:32.70]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[44:33.34]We got another notification here.
[44:35.32]Good relationship with younger son.
[44:36.96]Your younger son adores you like he used to back in better days.
[44:41.12]This is a drawing.
[44:43.75]An invite.
[44:44.21]Oh.
[44:45.57]Well, thanks.
[44:48.11]that's nice of you okay so we got a new case here got a good relationship with the sun is that that's that's that's king Louis I got some news here alright neighborhood gossip uh-oh most parasi I don't even know what that is
[45:12.02]ordinary.
[45:12.48]They have ordinary problems, ordinary consciences, and an ordinary resistance to pain.
[45:17.78]They were not hardened by the revolution.
[45:19.54]The father of the family that spread the rumor about your weaknesses was no different.
[45:24.78]A few punches were more than enough to convince his instincts that it was time to stop talking.
[45:34.24]Parisians.
[45:40.45]Why does it just say most people from Paris?
[45:43.95]Most Parisians.
[45:45.81]Is that what they're called?
[45:47.63]Parisians?
[45:51.50]I did not know that.
[45:56.92]Alright, so common folk endorsement went down by two, but my reputation went up.
[46:01.88]So that may not have been a great idea.
[46:05.90]Common folk -2, reputation plus one.
[46:10.39]That's from the gossip of the neighborhood.
[46:12.05]Alright, let's go.
[46:14.21]Alright, here we go.
[46:16.13]Who do we have here?
[46:16.95]We have the defendant is Oliver Mugler, a 65-year-old master locksmith who was famed among Parisian burglars as an expert on unopenable locks.
[46:27.82]Okay.
[46:29.41]Last month, he was commissioned by the owners of a Parisian glassworks, Jean Rude, Louis Raux, and Ferdinand Salon, to construct locks for ornate chests for valuables, presumably as gifts for their wives.
[46:43.79]The craftsman praised his latest creation as thief-proof.
[46:47.66]Shortly following their completion, the industrialist's houses were hit by a series of burglaries committed by a recent newcomer to Paris, Hector Vian.
[46:56.20]The thief from Orleans was caught in the act and shot by Ferdinand Salon.
[47:03.50]Huh.
[47:05.52]Okay, so he had somebody do his dirty work.
[47:08.04]Alright, let's see.
[47:30.08]So we have Master Locksmith, who is a famous locksmith.
[47:33.84]So a month ago, these three people commissioned him to make an impossible lock.
[47:38.83]Oh, there's more.
[47:42.75]Oh, right, okay.
[47:46.99]So let me just, I know, let me just get this, make sure I get this straight.
[47:50.35]So construct locks for ornate chests.
[47:52.93]So he's like, yeah, I can make a lock for you, and nobody will be able to break into it.
[47:56.03]Okay, great.
[47:57.82]After they were done, all their houses were hit by burglaries by a newcomer to Paris.
[48:05.01]This guy, Hector Vian.
[48:07.13]This is the thief from Orleans and shot by Ferdinand Salon.
[48:11.98]So Ferdinand Salon was one of the people that commissioned.
[48:16.76]So he was caught in the act at one of the houses.
[48:20.51]I got it.
[48:21.71]Further interesting information came from the owner of the Ginger Margo Inn.
[48:25.86]She recalled that on the night preceding the burglary, the locksmith met there with a man she didn't recognize.
[48:32.10]Based on her description, we were able to identify him as the aforementioned Hector Vian.
[48:37.12]The men allegedly engaged in an evening of drinking sponsored by Muggler.
[48:41.04]And then we have a map of Paris found on Hector Vian.
[48:44.49]Let's take a look.
[48:46.41]Do I have that in my...
[48:49.50]Oh, that's protocol.
[48:50.27]Where's, um... Is there a notebook somewhere?
[48:52.89]I kind of want to see the, uh... I kind of want to see it.
[49:00.85]Alright, so.
[49:01.67]Even... Oh, this is very obvious.
[49:03.06]Evening of drinking...
[49:05.87]A drunken evening.
[49:06.78]Uh... No, that's not an accusation.
[49:12.36]Marks on the map.
[49:13.48]Series of burglaries.
[49:15.84]Master locksmith.
[49:17.78]We only got fucking a few questions to ask here.
[49:21.27]Sends them thugs.
[49:22.01]No.
[49:23.09]The famous thief.
[49:25.81]Should I, like, accuse that you know who that is?
[49:32.48]This is, that's evidence.
[49:35.59]Master Locksmith is... What about the Drunken Evening?
[49:44.61]The construction of the locks... A series of bullet... But that's like a course of events.
[49:54.30]Okay.
[49:54.64]I still have six more questions to reveal, and I can only make three mistakes.
[50:00.31]Marks on the map?
[50:02.53]Or, I mean, come on.
[50:03.71]Like, you got marks on the goddamn map.
[50:07.94]That's an accusation, right?
[50:09.44]Like, yeah.
[50:11.88]Drunken evening.
[50:15.46]Course of events.
[50:16.78]Yep.
[50:18.22]Lock construction.
[50:22.26]Uh, personality.
[50:26.70]Famous thief.
[50:27.68]I guess you could say that's
[50:31.41]Extending Winning Circumstances, maybe?
[50:34.33]Lock Construction is Course of Events.
[50:43.20]It's probably Course of Events.
[50:44.49]Yeah.
[50:45.13]And then finally, Master Locksmith is Extending... Okay, we got them all.
[50:49.55]No mistakes.
[50:52.47]The jury has not revealed its verdict yet.
[50:54.17]So okay, the acquittal is for common folk think this guy's a common folk think this is a good guy and the revolutionaries Think don't want to think he's a bad guy We got the king in the court here And I am ready to start my questioning Robbing the bourgeoisie is no crime According to the case file you are citizen Oliver Muggler.
[51:15.37]Is that correct?
[51:17.71]Voice let's see
[51:21.51]Indeed it is.
[51:22.63]Monsieur Lejeune, may I have a request?
[51:25.00]I'd like to sit down.
[51:25.86]I'm an old man, you see.
[51:27.86]Basic respect for the judiciary requires that you remain standing.
[51:31.26]Do the names Salon, Rude, and Rowe mean anything to you?
[51:36.08]Why are you so determined to harass an old man?
[51:39.06]They sound like the names of my debtors.
[51:43.34]Debtors?
[51:44.60]They are the victims of activities you conducted.
[51:48.24]You mean locksmithing?
[51:55.74]You were commissioned by the victims to make chest locks.
[51:57.80]Did you know Hector Vian before?
[51:59.48]Do you recognize this map?
[52:02.10]Were you the one who marked the addresses on the map?
[52:04.74]How much did you charge for your services?
[52:06.62]We'll start... We're going to start at a zero.
[52:11.80]How much did you charge for your services?
[52:15.88]3,000 francs.
[52:17.68]Tidy some, that is.
[52:20.02]If you were a master locksmith, you'd charge that much too.
[52:23.64]That is quite a substantial fee.
[52:26.50]Indeed.
[52:27.52]That's how much it costs to have high-quality locks made by a master with nearly 50 years of experience.
[52:32.48]And those bastards never paid me a single franc.
[52:35.93]The victims did not pay you the agreed amount.
[52:38.79]Not a franc.
[52:40.11]I'd beat that money right out of them, but I'm too old for that.
[52:44.41]So you didn't get paid.
[52:48.20]Cases break it open wide.
[52:50.40]Alright, um... Rumor has it that you're one of the best locksmiths in all of Paris.
[52:59.99]I should deny it for modesty's sake, but I will not.
[53:04.75]That cannot be true, though, as a random thief from Orleans was easily able to open your locks.
[53:10.58]Well, then he must have been one of the best thieves in Holland.
[53:13.20]Let's be serious, mon seul agent.
[53:15.20]Every lot can be picked with the right talents, even mine.
[53:21.20]Okay.
[53:22.86]So we're going down towards revolutionaries here.
[53:31.13]Alright.
[53:31.47]I think it's time we bring out the big guns here.
[53:36.55]Hmm.
[53:36.71]Hmm.
[53:39.93]You were commissioned by the victims to make chest locks.
[53:42.89]Did you know Hector Vian before?
[53:47.36]This is the first time I've heard the name.
[53:49.56]That's interesting, as you were seen draining several bottles of wine together at the Ginger Margo Inn.
[53:53.28]Is that a crime?
[53:56.08]No, but the question is, why are you denying it now?
[53:58.76]Was your drinking spree just a deception for discussing the burglary?
[54:02.94]Nobody I had a drink with introduced themselves as Hector.
[54:07.22]I didn't plan on heist for Victor.
[54:09.78]Victor or Hugo.
[54:11.42]I'm a locksmith and I earn good money from it.
[54:13.98]Burglaries are for vagrants without a job.
[54:18.26]Okay, so you may have been drinking with him.
[54:21.62]There's no way to tell that you knew them beforehand.
[54:24.93]Okay.
[54:28.63]You recognize this map?
[54:31.27]No, I don't recall ever seeing it before.
[54:33.77]Ferdinand Salon claims that he gave you this map as advance payment for your services.
[54:40.72]He claims what?
[54:41.68]That wicked wretch of a second-rate merchant, he gave me a scrap of old paper as payment for making three locks?
[54:48.20]And said it's supposed to be worth more than 3,000 francs, he owes me?
[54:52.55]An honest laborer is being judged while frauds remain at large.
[54:56.77]Silence!
[54:57.97]So this map does belong to you?
[55:00.53]It doesn't.
[55:02.14]So where's the map that you received from Citizen Salon?
[55:06.04]I lost it.
[55:06.78]Oh, that's horseshit.
[55:09.64]I lost it.
[55:11.18]But it wasn't even worth a loaf of bread.
[55:13.36]So I surely won't shed a tear.
[55:15.39]But if you have it, maybe you stole it from me.
[55:18.43]You better make a note of that, Oliver.
[55:20.69]Muggler demands rumination from Rude.
[55:23.37]Roy and Salon.
[55:27.41]Alright.
[55:28.59]Hold on a second here.
[55:34.67]I didn't pay him though.
[55:39.33]Can I call somebody to the stands?
[55:44.47]Did they not pay him?
[55:53.00]So circumstantially he could have been just drinking.
[56:01.24]He just may have been out there hanging out.
[56:04.26]And maybe he got the map stolen from him by the guy he was drinking with.
[56:18.34]Right?
[56:19.82]And if he didn't get paid, then maybe he's just kind of disgruntled.
[56:39.83]Ah, common people don't like that.
[56:44.77]Prison is not something that the common people want.
[56:49.71]I have more questions.
[56:50.71]Do I... is there a... is there a penalty to... Well, I mean, I guess, look, right?
[56:54.31]So, depending on how I want to have this play out here, I could ask another question.
[56:59.39]This one.
[56:59.73]This is balanced, right?
[57:02.45]Let's bring this up a little bit.
[57:04.95]Or the neutral ones.
[57:05.67]Did you give Hector the map?
[57:09.40]I gave nothing to Achilles, Hector, or any other Greek god.
[57:13.54]Call on the witness, citizen Jean Rude.
[57:16.07]Oh, there we go.
[57:19.47]Jean Rude in the flesh.
[57:21.33]He will not speak unless called upon.
[57:23.77]Naturally, of course.
[57:26.01]What went missing during the burglary?
[57:30.94]My house was the first one to be robbed, and in my case it was mostly valuables.
[57:35.00]At Rue's house, he will not say it himself, and I do not want to go to prison.
[57:39.04]It was the letters he had exchanged over the years with King Louis.
[57:44.54]Damn monarchist!
[57:46.50]Salon did not lose a thing.
[57:48.10]He shot that vermin in the act.
[57:49.80]That is what he said.
[57:52.22]What happened to the items that he stole?
[57:54.95]That still remains unknown.
[57:56.23]According to Salon, Hector had nothing with him.
[57:59.16]Ferdinand suspects he had hidden the other valuables somewhere.
[58:04.62]He hid the other items before robbing the last house?
[58:08.22]Strange.
[58:10.47]Huh.
[58:15.57]Advanced payment in the form of a map, its disappearance, the murder of a burglar, and a lack of payment for services.
[58:21.91]You look upset.
[58:22.55]What are you afraid of?
[58:26.11]Yeah, look at all this shit.
[58:29.18]and a lack of payment for services.
[58:33.66]It all makes for a rather strange story, a suspicious one too.
[58:37.64]Why do not?
[58:39.32]What are you mumbling?
[58:40.96]If I say something, will I be free?
[58:43.81]He knows something.
[58:45.81]Please testify what you know immediately.
[58:50.83]The map was Salon's idea.
[58:53.13]He told the thief about the advance payment we gave the locksmith and proposed that Hector steal it.
[58:59.25]And he did?
[59:00.73]Indeed, but when the bastard robbed us, later we were forced by Solan not to pay the locksmith because he sent the thief after us.
[59:08.42]And that's when it all went down a drain.
[59:11.26]That's the bourgeoisie for you.
[59:12.56]He fooled them all and went in one fell swoop.
[59:16.89]It sounds like Citizen Solan had everything planned.
[59:20.11]However, there's no evidence to support the claim.
[59:22.83]Perhaps it is Citizen Rude that is plotting against his partner and wants to frame him.
[59:30.25]And Vian is dead, so he will not be able to shed light on any of this.
[59:37.31]If I was younger, I'd give that Solan a drubbing.
[59:40.25]I'd peep that good-for-nothing lying bastard.
[59:43.60]Please restrain yourself.
[59:44.74]The testimony of a witness is still not evidence.
[59:46.96]Neither of Citizen Solan's guilt, nor of your innocence.
[59:51.89]Oh, shit.
[59:55.59]Well...
[59:59.46]I don't think that you are... I don't think you committed a crime here.
[60:08.34]This is the jury's opinion.
[60:10.24]Yeah.
[60:12.37]Yeah, I think we got enough information here.
[60:17.31]That's an acquittal.
[60:22.75]Ask them neutral questions?
[60:24.33]I don't think I even need to.
[60:26.93]Did you tell Hector how to open the locks?
[60:29.98]I understand what you're implying, but consider this.
[60:31.67]If he sold the secret of my locks, then my business would be over.
[60:35.13]Word spreads fast among thieves.
[60:37.47]Yeah.
[60:40.19]I guess I could probably ask one of these.
[60:42.13]I don't think it would go up much higher.
[60:46.52]I need to know.
[60:47.08]Were you the one who marked the addresses on the maps?
[60:49.62]No.
[60:50.78]No, he didn't do shit.
[60:52.70]He's innocent.
[60:59.06]Yep.
[60:59.80]We're going to be... We lost with the revolutionaries, though.
[61:03.86]Risk of being removed from office.
[61:05.14]We can't let this go down that far.
[61:09.80]Kill him, just in case.
[61:13.66]This is risky.
[61:15.28]Because that makes it... I've got to think about my career.
[61:19.41]Alright, acquittal.
[61:22.93]That's my verdict.
[61:24.35]There's way too much going on here.
[61:30.94]The verdict for citizen Oliver Mugler is not guilty.
[61:37.06]Lead the defendant away.
[61:38.88]Bravo, Mugler.
[61:40.88]Away with the bourgeoisie.
[61:43.39]If I may, to be honest, this does bear the marks of social justice.
[61:47.87]They would not pay him, so he had them robbed.
[61:51.45]There is a balance here.
[61:54.56]Grandpa, that's not really what happened.
[62:00.78]Common Folk.
[62:02.42]Okay.
[62:05.93]Lost with the Revolutionaries, but gained with the Common Folk.
[62:10.33]Senile old man couldn't even hear the case.
[62:12.63]With that, am I good to go?
[62:15.13]Well, that's good, because I lost some Common Folk.
[62:18.25]So I just gained it back.
[62:20.21]What am I doing on the hierarchy?
[62:21.63]I'm still just... Oh, wait a minute, hold on.
[62:24.06]Who are these two?
[62:26.18]David.
[62:27.92]Oh, that's the guy that came to me and said...
[62:30.87]Who is this guy with the sunglasses on?
[62:35.33]He's widely referred to as the incorruptible.
[62:38.05]As leader of the radical Jacobins, he preserves order in the national convention with an iron fist and, if need be, terror.
[62:45.58]Undeniably the most powerful man in Paris in the age of revolution.
[62:49.04]As yet, none have dared defy him.
[62:58.77]That's me.
[63:00.11]So this is my friend.
[63:01.27]And I don't know who this, I guess I don't know who that is yet.
[63:04.75]Alright, we've got plenty of good names here.
[63:06.13]Alright, congratulations, you're free.
[63:08.54]I think that's good.
[63:10.90]Let's get out of here, next.
[63:18.16]I look at authentic map by Togo.
[63:20.10]It would be a pity if it rotted in a safe deposit box.
[63:24.35]We cannot do that.
[63:26.27]These are court deposits.
[63:29.16]Well, Batilda did tell me long ago to take care of my study at home.
[63:33.13]There you go!
[63:33.95]I know someone who can remove these mocks without damaging the map!
[63:40.81]The king is just still hanging out here.
[63:42.05]Is he sleeping?
[63:44.51]King Louis XVI.
[63:46.61]There were people who truly loved him.
[63:52.94]He reminded the French they had noble ancestors.
[64:05.26]Do not be manipulated by people who are not bearing the burden of responsibility.
[64:09.68]It's a good George Washington right there quote.
[64:16.63]This saddened me.
[64:18.55]Someone had advised him to say that.
[64:21.07]Someone who is well aware of the cold, inevitable wind of change.
[64:30.60]I did not pity the king, but those who will come after him, as they will not have great ancestors.
[64:42.41]Okay.
[64:43.57]One of us.
[64:45.63]A Frenchman marched in the streets of Paris side by side, one line after another, to commemorate Jacques Guillemin Simeon, mayor of Entamps.
[64:53.63]He was murdered by a furious mob, punished for a law he did not enact, but was obliged to observe.
[64:58.54]Freedom of speech killed him.
[65:00.22]If we understand this as the right to cast stones to show one's discontent, the right to murder people because you deem them responsible for your miserable life, surely the people of Paris would prefer if we said that nothing happened.
[65:14.45]Lost common folk.
[65:17.13]Gained revolutionary.
[65:27.97]Your son is rather good with the violine.
[65:31.59]He is both talented and enthusiastic.
[65:34.75]I'd prefer that he was as enthusiastic about the law books I give him.
[65:38.29]I look so defeated.
[65:40.59]Maybe his destiny is to become an artist, not a lawyer.
[65:44.68]Mother likes to hear me plain, and there's nothing more boring than law.
[65:49.10]See?
[65:50.12]He would rather let his career rely on the humours of the people.
[65:54.74]There are many ways to resue-escue France.
[65:57.46]Believe me, our country desperately needs something to ennoble it.
[66:00.60]The power is in the hands of simple, illiterate people.
[66:04.04]Let him rescue their souls with music.
[66:08.30]That's better than boring laws and clauses.
[66:11.72]See what you're doing?
[66:12.64]You're spoiling my child.
[66:15.34]I do not have my own children to spoil, so I am focusing on yours.
[66:20.58]Speaking of which... Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[66:23.05]Alright, here we go.
[66:29.07]Locked action.
[66:30.41]After various important events, you may find yourself in an action forced upon you.
[66:35.16]On this day, you become the victim of your own decisions.
[66:42.09]Oh.
[66:42.49]You cannot change.
[66:43.47]You attended the parade in memory of the lynched official.
[66:48.86]So that's what we did.
[66:51.28]That's what we're going to do.
[66:58.38]People influence Bernard.
[67:01.46]Influence on revolutionaries.
[67:03.15]Wife is not that happy.
[67:04.93]Son's doing alright.
[67:08.69]Liberté.
[67:09.53]Day three.
[67:15.79]That is our new symbol of freedom.
[67:18.34]You can still smell the fresh wood.
[67:21.14]Do you feel free looking at it?
[67:23.90]Individuals like us do not need symbols, but France does.
[67:29.74]Did you hear the news of the day?
[67:32.02]People are running around like headless chickens and yelling about Louis and his entourage escaping Paris.
[67:38.00]So, we will not be enjoying the aroma of fresh wood for long.
[67:41.91]Monuments like that are not installed solely for the purpose of punishing thieves or lesser aristocrats.
[67:49.36]Do you think it wants to taste royal blood?
[67:52.38]Louis' flight was a stupid move, yet it seems it was planned.
[67:57.20]One of us will sacrifice him.
[67:58.96]That is, if they catch him.
[68:02.90]Is that why Louis visited us at the court?
[68:06.32]To manipulate us?
[68:10.25]Maybe deep in his heart he felt what the builders of the guillotine did, that someone has to be exposed as a traitor, even if there is none.
[68:18.28]Interesting, okay.
[68:27.83]This is Antoine.
[68:30.63]Welcome, citizen Fidel.
[68:31.87]My name is Antoine Quentin Farquhar de Tinville.
[68:36.75]I am the public prosecutor that has been assigned to assist at every tribunal trial starting from today.
[68:41.46]Okay.
[68:44.62]I should warn you that I am uncompromising, although I hope that we quickly find common ground.
[68:49.38]In happier news, the construction of the guillotine has been finished.
[68:53.06]We may begin using it today.
[68:55.82]Yes, we've seen it.
[68:59.04]The king is gone.
[69:00.56]Treason.
[69:01.44]Anyone with information about his whereabouts should immediately disclose it to the authorities.
[69:07.10]From Rasputin.
[69:09.78]Okay.
[69:13.12]Anyone with information about his whereabouts should immediately disclose it to the authorities.
[69:19.50]Okay.
[69:21.75]So I'm assuming, is it this?
[69:23.05]There's a lot here.
[69:26.33]Where does it start?
[69:29.42]Okay, so this is burglary.
[69:33.40]Hold on, let's see.
[69:36.04]Notifications, let's see.
[69:40.04]Uh, good relations with father.
[69:41.48]Yours, pride and joy.
[69:42.48]Keep it up.
[69:48.63]Anything else?
[69:49.75]Okay, so father and son.
[69:52.37]Both very, very happy.
[69:57.25]so we've got death penalty prison and then acquittal that's the common common vote and revolutionaries the jury has not revealed its verdict yet we need to use the new toy oh god do it do it with no questions
[70:26.80]Immediately do it.
[70:29.74]You got... Hold on a second.
[70:35.72]They just... They're not even done building it.
[70:40.66]I want blood.
[70:41.34]Do it.
[70:41.92]Do it.
[70:42.44]At least once.
[70:43.46]No... What?
[70:50.22]There is no save game.
[70:55.30]Do it.
[70:55.68]They just built it.
[71:07.36]Oh my god, guys.
[71:08.62]That's gonna...
[71:22.92]The defendant confessed to the crimes?
[71:30.12]No.
[71:31.02]What made the defendant famous in the eyes of the people?
[71:37.10]This one.
[71:39.35]How did the defendant explain signs of assault?
[71:50.25]I don't know.
[71:53.72]I don't know.
[72:02.02]I sentenced citizen John Ilver to be guillotined.
[72:06.16]I just got an achievement for doing that, by the way.
[72:10.54]The evidence against him was not conclusive!
[72:12.84]Outrageous!
[72:13.84]What are you doing, you fool, traitor of the people, murderer of our hero?
[72:17.74]A verdict already?
[72:18.83]What about the trial?
[72:23.07]Bad job!
[72:23.69]I got an achievement for that.
[72:27.05]It said qu- I think I- if you guillotine somebody within 10 seconds of it starting, you get an achievement.
[72:41.92]Rumors are spreading.
[72:43.20]Rumors about your careless approach to your duties are spreading.
[72:45.62]You'd better shape it up if you want to keep your job.
[72:54.12]That wasn't worth it.
[72:55.92]Maybe it was for the achievement.
[73:00.04]No.
[73:08.18]No.
[73:12.21]Maybe I could win the heart of the crowd.
[73:15.63]Earn the favor of the crowd by delivering a speech or proceed directly to the execution.
[73:22.13]Wha- I have to give a speech?
[73:23.83]On me?
[73:24.73]Just- Remember, once you start your speech, there's no going back.
[73:29.26]An awkward or clumsy speech will earn you nothing but ridicule from the audience.
[73:33.92]Depending on your reputation, the crowd will be more or less aggressive.
[73:40.26]Ugh.
[73:45.95]Strategy building, what?
[73:50.71]Before attempting persuasion, you may explore different approaches to all the topics of the conversation.
[73:56.76]After employing every kind of emotion, you will receive an evaluation of your choices.
[74:02.22]Okay.
[74:04.42]Each attitude comes with a set of emotions that have a positive and negative impact.
[74:08.47]Learn their effects to manipulate the people of Paris in any way you please.
[74:12.41]The higher your reputation, the more you know about the other speaker's attitudes.
[74:16.43]You can also obtain this information by spending influence points.
[74:21.68]Okay.
[74:23.12]Choose topic.
[74:24.54]Humility.
[74:25.38]The defendant.
[74:28.30]Manipulation.
[74:29.09]Revolution.
[74:30.49]Okay.
[74:30.91]Oh my god.
[74:35.63]Crime.
[74:39.55]Aggression.
[74:40.46]Defendant.
[74:43.74]Humility.
[74:44.90]Revolution.
[74:46.64]Manipulation.
[74:51.47]I got points, right?
[74:55.27]Oversensitive.
[74:56.07]Okay, so there you go.
[74:56.79]A strong argument.
[74:58.07]Good.
[75:01.32]And they're attached.
[75:02.78]So, maybe actually... Yeah.
[75:05.24]Manipulate, humility, and we'll go with some aggression here.
[75:14.30]If they're oversensitive, why would I want to be aggressive?
[75:18.73]If they're attached, why would I want to be aggressive?
[75:20.35]No.
[75:21.84]What are you talking about?
[75:25.87]I don't think I need it.
[75:34.19]Alright, here we go.
[75:38.80]Today marks the... What?
[75:42.10]What's going on?
[75:43.24]When there is a crime, there must be punishment.
[75:46.32]and we shall dish it out.
[75:48.34]Oh yes, even the convict's ancestors shall feel the cold edge of the guillotine slicing through their necks.
[76:00.37]The criminals belong in the grave, only then we build a better future.
[76:08.46]The reign of the previous rulers, whose goal was to bring injustice to the people, ends with their swift deaths.
[76:18.14]They were doubtful.
[76:18.82]Alright, I understand.
[76:24.28]You can reveal it.
[76:27.27]You decapitated a man for a scuffle in the streets.
[76:30.19]People, I rescued you and now you murder me.
[76:32.45]What?
[76:42.42]What is that?
[76:48.15]Pull the revolution.
[76:49.11]Oh, I have to do this.
[76:52.84]I'm just the judge.
[76:56.15]Pull the ro-
[77:18.08]Due to the establishment of a revolutionary tribunal, we need to prepare an official stamp.
[77:22.71]I was told to ask you, citizen, because President Devoy is indisposed.
[77:32.21]How much did he drink?
[77:34.33]He was not able to say, shall we?
[77:38.37]Design your stamp.
[77:39.47]Okay.
[77:40.71]My base, I want it to be like three dots.
[77:50.44]I like this.
[77:51.00]I like that.
[77:52.06]Emblem.
[77:52.42]The crow.
[77:53.58]The chicken.
[77:54.90]The compass.
[77:56.98]The horn.
[77:58.60]The scale.
[77:59.82]The book.
[78:01.63]The White House.
[78:03.83]The owl.
[78:05.29]The quarter.
[78:06.71]The judge.
[78:08.45]The tree.
[78:11.01]The surrender.
[78:12.53]The time.
[78:14.41]The key.
[78:16.64]The lady.
[78:18.46]The goblet of fire.
[78:20.26]The lion.
[78:22.44]Defense.
[78:24.58]Eagle.
[78:26.02]Bow and arrow.
[78:29.73]A musket man.
[78:32.07]And then the two crayons.
[78:33.15]I think I'm going to do the two crayons.
[78:43.86]I like... No, something a little smaller.
[78:48.99]I like that.
[78:52.87]Change the base.
[78:53.39]We're going to have to... We're going to have the crayon crossed.
[78:57.50]That's alright.
[79:00.84]That looks good.
[79:03.76]I'm sorry.
[79:10.16]Thank you for your time.
[79:10.86]I know it's late.
[79:11.50]The stamp should be ready tomorrow.
[79:12.70]Good night.
[79:19.33]Look, okay.
[79:20.41]Work on tomorrow's trial.
[79:21.59]Alright, now that I got that, you can't ask for that again.
[79:26.58]You used your one chat joke trump card, right?
[79:30.50]Not again.
[79:34.36]So work on tomorrow's trial.
[79:36.67]You will unlock more question effects in court.
[79:38.71]I have to do this.
[79:40.51]Because I need to make sure this trial is done correctly.
[79:51.77]The wife.
[79:54.64]Go gamble.
[79:55.96]Evening gambling.
[79:57.44]You should spend some time with your father every now and then.
[79:59.74]Show him your world.
[80:01.36]Perhaps he will get a taste for it.
[80:02.66]Your world?
[80:05.38]Go lie down face up with the neck in guillotine.
[80:10.49]And pray for soft winds.
[80:21.61]Hmm.
[80:22.77]Paragraphs and codes.
[80:25.53]Needs to learn some more perspective skills and law can be taught.
[80:28.91]And law can be an art in its own right.
[80:33.70]Your eldest wife is gonna hate you?
[80:35.30]I only have one wife.
[80:36.20]What are you talking about?
[80:38.24]You take your family for an evening stroll around Paris.
[80:40.32]It will let your father stretch his bones a little.
[80:48.49]Let's take the family out.
[80:51.52]Whoa, he hated that.
[80:54.26]He liked it.
[80:57.30]Okay, what about the sun?
[80:59.33]Nice, almost got a fall bar.
[81:04.99]He's old, he hates walking.
[81:09.07]You only read chat when they give you shitty joke advice?
[81:11.99]I read chat the whole day, what?
[81:14.17]What are you talking about?
[81:20.01]That was, okay, that was a unanimous chat decision, alright?
[81:24.21]There was only a couple of one guys that didn't want me to do that.
[81:28.18]You can't, now go back to your chat logs, and you look at that unanimous chat display.
[81:36.32]It was, I didn't even need to do a poll, it was so overwhelming.
[81:42.41]I got the achievement.
[81:44.09]I got, like, to kill a guy without even looking, achievement.
[81:52.16]Alright, anyways, let's go.
[81:58.09]I wasn't joking and I'm glad you killed him.
[82:04.55]Alright.
[82:04.95]Alright, here's Matthew.
[82:08.06]Tragically, we are losing control of the streets.
[82:11.52]People feel betrayed by the king, and some believe him to be a spy trying to elude justice.
[82:17.48]Special means are recommended when suppressing unrest.
[82:22.12]We only need an opinion from the judges to make sure... Let me read that again, because I have to do that again.
[82:27.07]I wasn't paying attention.
[82:28.53]Special means are recommended when suppressing unrest.
[82:31.63]We only need an opinion from the judges to make sure we are working legally.
[82:36.27]In other words, you need their blessing to shoot at protesters.
[82:40.27]People can't control their emotions and are hurting other citizens as a result.
[82:44.05]Look at the windows.
[82:44.94]Next time, they might do something worse than just throw rocks.
[82:50.70]Uh...
[82:53.11]It pains us to see unrest growing in the streets of Paris.
[82:56.43]Commander-in-Chief Burrell has informed us that the Guard is no longer able to control the situation through peaceful means.
[83:02.92]It is recommended that he be allowed to use more immediate methods to protect the innocent civilians.
[83:08.20]But we would like to know the Tribunal's opinion on the matter.
[83:12.34]I approve of the National Guard's use of force against ruffians running, ruining the capital.
[83:21.29]Uh...
[83:31.57]Accept it.
[83:32.23]Chat deserves karma.
[83:35.05]No, no, I... I'm with Grandpa on this one.
[83:37.91]Yeah, I'm with... No.
[83:52.53]The authority should not use force against the people.
[83:55.03]If it has to, it already has lost.
[83:57.84]I do not approve of this decree.
[84:12.06]Oh, right.
[84:12.54]I just put it on my signature.
[84:15.51]What is the first time I've done this?
[84:16.81]I don't know.
[84:20.17]Without this document, we can only wait for the citizens of Paris to start killing each other before our very eyes.
[84:26.31]I hope you know what you're doing.
[84:28.11]The convention may have issued that decree, but I have no doubt it was Robert Sperry's idea.
[84:39.98]Executes a guy with literally no trial.
[84:42.66]Whoa, violence against civilians.
[84:44.48]Ah, that's not okay.
[84:48.70]That wasn't me.
[84:49.38]I was out sick that day.
[84:51.42]Chat took over that day.
[84:52.88]I was out sick.
[84:56.73]The mob wanted to act as both judge and jury again and hang people from the street lamps.
[85:01.79]Poor Pochett was almost hanged.
[85:04.76]Pochard?
[85:05.38]Claude Pochard?
[85:06.92]Exactly.
[85:08.12]The beloved tutor of your Frederick.
[85:10.34]You had to dismiss him after the incident with the oath of the clergy, did you not?
[85:15.44]Yes, Frederick tells me from time to time that he misses his teacher.
[85:21.22]What are you doing?
[85:21.80]The trial's about to begin.
[85:24.38]It's about Monsieur Pochard.
[85:27.72]News travels fast.
[85:28.64]He's been accused of counter-revolutionary activities.
[85:32.19]You know him.
[85:32.97]It can't be true.
[85:35.21]It's not so simple.
[85:36.47]Leave before somebody hears us.
[85:38.77]Papa, please.
[85:40.89]Go home.
[85:42.94]Think about the family for once at least.
[85:45.66]Papa.
[85:50.36]Uh-oh.
[85:54.76]Good relationship with the elder son.
[85:56.27]Got good relationship.
[85:57.13]Okay.
[85:57.53]Alright, let's see here.
[85:58.29]We got... The family wants acquittal.
[86:01.93]This is...
[86:04.26]The revolutionaries want prison and the common folk want the death penalty.
[86:10.19]Okay.
[86:11.87]Interesting.
[86:15.29]You are, please introduce yourself.
[86:18.30]This is Claude Pochard.
[86:19.72]Monsieur Le Georges, you know me.
[86:22.56]State your personal information or there will be consequences.
[86:26.44]Claude Pochard, Monsieur Le Georges.
[86:29.43]You stand accused of spying for the counter-revolutionaries and criticizing the existing order.
[86:33.65]Do you admit to these crimes?
[86:36.78]I am innocent.
[86:37.80]The accusation is exaggerated and comes from the ill-will of the accusers.
[86:42.94]Suggesting that the revolutionary government is acting in ill-will typical of a priest.
[86:53.03]Okay.
[86:58.38]Uh, counter-revolution and treason.
[87:03.79]Claude Pochard, a 26-year-old vicar and tutor, son of a cobbler, believes in Enlightenment ideals.
[87:12.76]After refusing to endure the civil constitution of the clergy, he was removed from his parish, prohibited from carrying out his duties, and sentenced to banishment.
[87:24.29]Despite this, he stayed in Paris and continued his work as a tutor, which he started before 1789.
[87:32.83]Pochard was captured in the streets by fortuitous circumstance.
[87:37.47]A guard officer present during his trial a few months ago recognized him and didn't hesitate to act.
[87:44.71]Following an investigation, Pochard was accused of spying and spreading counter-revolutionary propaganda in order to prepare for an intervention that would end the revolution.
[87:57.54]Correspondence with Archbishop Jean-Arsène de Breteu was found in a room Pochard had been renting from Marie Guimet.
[88:05.60]In it, the clergyman asked for information about the unrest and the supporters of the monarchy in hiding.
[88:12.86]Riches were also found, a golden chalice, and a reliquary.
[88:20.84]Moreover, the director of one of the orphanages, Claude Totten, testified that the tutor would question the law of the revolution in front of the students, stating that it was less important than the laws handed down by God.
[88:37.97]A letter to Claude Pochard.
[88:47.84]Okay.
[88:49.46]So, we have...
[88:52.27]He was a tutor.
[88:55.45]He refused the civil constitution of the clergy.
[88:57.90]So he was removed.
[88:59.02]He was banished.
[89:00.54]But he stayed.
[89:01.98]Okay.
[89:04.08]I'm not going to execute him.
[89:07.48]So he stayed.
[89:08.06]He stuck around.
[89:08.48]He still was doing tutoring.
[89:11.06]And over the course of a few months, somebody recognized that he was still here.
[89:16.56]He didn't adhere to his banishment.
[89:19.97]And then there was an investigation and was accused of spying and spreading counter-revolution propaganda.
[89:27.25]To prepare for a foreign intervention that would end the revolution.
[89:31.95]There were riches also found.
[89:36.98]Let's take a look.
[89:37.92]So, let's see, see, see.
[89:39.10]Okay.
[89:40.40]A letter from the church riches spreading propaganda espionage.
[89:44.10]Tudor.
[89:46.56]Tudor.
[89:49.79]stuff about banishment so you were banished for speaking against right so this is this would be counter-revolution but it's tutor tutor a tutor church riches that's evidence
[90:16.32]Spreading propaganda.
[90:18.19]That's counter-revolution.
[90:20.23]Espionage.
[90:21.59]That's an accusation.
[90:24.37]Hmm.
[90:25.75]Four more questions possible.
[90:28.50]Parish priest.
[90:30.82]That's a personality question.
[90:35.76]I have another possibility for propaganda.
[90:37.24]I mean, that's an accusation.
[90:46.78]Letter from the Archbishop.
[90:47.82]That looks like evidence to me.
[90:49.58]Banishment is the course of events.
[90:50.98]We got them all.
[90:54.30]Alright.
[90:55.21]We don't know where the jury stands at the moment.
[91:02.83]So we can just... Let's just do... What do you teach?
[91:08.27]Why did the accused stay in France despite being banished?
[91:12.43]Sekiro unlocks in three hours.
[91:14.07]Okay.
[91:15.95]Oh, wow.
[91:20.49]No, but I can't.
[91:21.21]I can't.
[91:21.59]Don't even tell me that.
[91:22.59]Don't tell me that.
[91:23.17]I already got it loaded.
[91:24.61]Don't tell me that.
[91:28.36]Alright, so why... That's a good question.
[91:30.82]Why are you still here?
[91:33.54]Why are you still here?
[91:35.82]I had to take care of my sick mother.
[91:37.58]Without me, she would surely have died.
[91:40.69]Why did you not take her with you?
[91:43.31]Good, make the filth squirm.
[91:46.15]I was in no position to afford that.
[91:48.31]I am just a poor parish priest who is unable to even carry out his duties.
[91:52.41]I have to teach every single day to survive.
[91:55.68]Is that why you started spying?
[91:57.72]For money?
[91:59.80]No.
[92:00.76]What information could I glean that would be useful to emmigres?
[92:07.46]that of the supposed persecution of priests, the main argument that Archbishop de Berthoud and Pius VI are using to convince Catholic monarchs to strike against the revolution.
[92:21.72]I do not correspond with emigres, and I certainly do not write about the suffering of our clergymen.
[92:28.91]I would like to remind you that we have evidence.
[92:31.59]Away with the liar!
[92:37.69]okay we already got that one mother was sick uh what do you teach the caregivers in orphanages only pay for reading and writing lessons so why do the accused teach children that god's laws stands above that of the republic you spread superstition and counter-revolutionary propaganda
[93:04.84]This is a misunderstanding.
[93:06.38]The children I teach are unable to understand such complicated matters.
[93:11.06]The Acuteist's explanation further incriminates him.
[93:14.86]If they are unable to understand the topic, why would he even discuss it at all?
[93:19.47]The Church spreads ignorance and takes our money.
[93:23.53]I was only answering questions from the director of the orphanages in Gombines.
[93:28.40]I said that God's law stood above my banishment.
[93:31.09]It is God's law that prohibits me from leaving the country.
[93:33.97]I have a duty to help those in need.
[93:37.69]Whoa.
[93:39.57]Okay.
[93:39.75]We're currently leaning towards acquittal.
[93:44.58]At the moment.
[93:47.52]I need more info.
[93:48.76]Alright, so hold on.
[93:58.33]Hmm.
[93:59.87]Who... Okay, this is... My family would think this is a good idea, because this is a friend of the family.
[94:06.81]Common folk want the death penalty currently leaning.
[94:09.35]Alright, here we go.
[94:15.09]What information did the accused manage to convey to Archbishop de Blouty?
[94:20.58]None.
[94:21.28]I have no connection with the Archbishop.
[94:22.84]Why would he be interested in a parish priest's help?
[94:26.63]What about your letter?
[94:27.93]We have it in our files.
[94:28.99]You received instructions from the Archbishop himself.
[94:33.04]Pope's dog!
[94:34.54]Behead the traitor!
[94:36.66]It's a simple letter, not instructions.
[94:38.98]And it's not from the Archbishop, but from my parish priest-incumbent, Jean-Arcine Coreteau.
[94:44.89]Where is he now?
[94:46.81]I know only that he planned to leave for Switzerland.
[94:48.73]He may have changed his mind.
[94:49.91]That is why I never thought to respond to the letter.
[94:53.51]What a coincidence.
[94:55.05]Archbishop de Brutille currently resides in Switzerland.
[95:01.18]It is indeed a coincidence many clergymen reside in Switzerland.
[95:05.64]You believe that?
[95:06.54]Uh-oh.
[95:13.29]I mean, that's... Come on.
[95:22.32]The accused travels extensively around the world, around the Paris department.
[95:26.13]To what end?
[95:28.97]Why?
[95:29.99]I teach wherever I can find students.
[95:31.51]Doing that requires time and effort, I admit.
[95:34.39]Is that why you received gold from your fellow conspirators abroad?
[95:38.41]He travels around France to spy on people.
[95:42.01]The only money I see comes from my students' caregivers.
[95:44.60]It's not at all immodest.
[95:47.02]So where did the riches found in your room come from?
[95:50.52]Ugh!
[95:52.23]They were litig... They were lit... They were literally accountments.
[95:57.39]Ah, yeah.
[95:57.73]They were liturgic... They were liturgical accroachments.
[96:01.18]I saw... Everyone's gonna make fun of me now.
[96:04.64]They were liturgical accroachments.
[96:06.96]I saved them from the plunder of the church encumbrance.
[96:09.82]I would rather go hungry than sell them.
[96:12.96]They were literally... Okay.
[96:17.89]Fanatic.
[96:18.71]Thief.
[96:19.85]Peddler of superstition.
[96:26.55]Boy, I know what donation words I'm using next time.
[96:29.31]What?
[96:29.71]What does that mean?
[96:32.91]Alright.
[96:33.87]Hold on.
[96:39.14]Alright, summon the witness.
[96:43.38]Marie Guimet.
[96:47.82]Citizen, what is your name?
[96:50.64]Marie Guimet.
[96:51.82]Monsieur Lejeu.
[96:54.23]Was the witness aware that she was renting a room to an unsworn Catholic priest?
[97:00.07]Did the accused maintain extensive correspondence?
[97:10.86]What if this is also a spy?
[97:13.68]I'm gonna say this one.
[97:15.82]Did the accused maintain extensive correspondence?
[97:19.94]Meaning?
[97:21.34]Did he receive many letters?
[97:24.05]I don't remember any letters with his name.
[97:26.93]Perhaps he had a rich social life.
[97:28.79]Did he entertain any guests?
[97:31.28]I don't remember anyone visiting him at all.
[97:33.72]He wasn't there most of the time anyway.
[97:35.34]He just used the room to sleep.
[97:37.94]Where would he go?
[97:39.90]I don't ask my guests about things like that.
[97:43.28]Hmm.
[97:46.99]Did he pay rent on time?
[97:49.37]Did he ever criticize the revolution and its accomplishments?
[97:57.39]Wow, did he pay his rent on time?
[97:59.19]I feel like this is much more... This makes more sense.
[98:05.23]Did he pay rent on time?
[98:11.25]Did he pay rent on time?
[98:13.47]Sometimes I had to threaten to kick him out, but eventually he would always pay.
[98:18.73]So the accused did not strike you as a person who has a substantial amount of money to operate with or spend freely.
[98:26.15]no he lived like a poor man I mean a normal fellow would never get rich from teaching okay huh what stiffen does the accuser see so he is maybe he's hiding it though what do you get from being a teacher
[98:53.56]Two francs a week, but most people give me food instead, bread... They're all French.
[98:58.47]I'm realizing this now.
[99:03.47]Yeah, this is not England.
[99:07.15]Let me rephrase this.
[99:12.00]Two francs a week, but most people give me food instead, bread, butter, or sometimes wine.
[99:15.96]I don't know how to do a French accent.
[99:18.24]I can't do that.
[99:18.80]I'm going back to English.
[99:27.05]Of course it bothers me, but I do have to eat.
[99:32.15]He keeps gold under his bed and still takes food from the poor.
[99:38.03]We demand an explanation.
[99:39.33]Where does the gold come from?
[99:41.59]Is it not from your fellow conspirators abroad?
[99:44.81]Of course not.
[99:45.87]It belongs to the flourishing compound which is currently under my care.
[99:48.93]This gold is not my property.
[99:59.05]Why did the accused continue teaching instead of leaving?
[100:01.13]Alright, I think people are going to start chanting for his head here.
[100:05.29]I gotta... Hold on, where's the evidence?
[100:09.21]Where's the evidence?
[100:10.71]Do I have any more evidence?
[100:18.91]Did the defendant confess to the crime?
[100:22.67]Oh, I can do this.
[100:23.57]Where?
[100:23.93]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[100:24.91]Hold on.
[100:29.39]Did the accused celebrate masses despite the ban?
[100:34.70]There are no judges where I could do that.
[100:37.76]Then what purpose do the chalice and the reliquary possessed by the accused serve?
[100:43.70]Private religious practice.
[100:46.64]You are prohibited from administering sacraments.
[100:50.38]It's not a sacrament, merely prayer.
[100:52.68]The Declaration of Rights of the Man and of the Citizen allows me to pray.
[100:55.74]You should be familiar with the document.
[100:57.94]Stupid!
[101:00.30]That is beside the point.
[101:01.34]By promoting superstitions in a progressive country, you are spreading sedition.
[101:12.93]Why did the accused continue teaching?
[101:15.41]Why did you do this?
[101:18.29]My duty is to help others.
[101:20.21]If I am unable to help as a priest, I want to at least share some of my knowledge.
[101:25.68]Your knowledge is a Catholic propaganda.
[101:28.84]I prefer the term, alright, hold on.
[101:31.22]They are both at the same point.
[101:36.34]I'm trailing into like Jamaican, you're right.
[101:38.64]Alright, hold on.
[101:40.14]I prefer the term, I prefer the term Catholic values.
[101:51.44]Okay.
[101:53.69]Jury's opinion is... doesn't... don't need to kill him.
[101:57.61]Family wants to be acquitted.
[101:58.77]Hold on, let me see anything else I can do here.
[102:04.89]Did the defendant confess?
[102:06.34]No.
[102:07.18]Was his act counter-revolutionary?
[102:10.38]When and where did the defendant corrupt the people of Paris?
[102:17.71]During arguments?
[102:18.55]No, it would be here.
[102:20.77]During the reading and writing lessons in the orphanage, right?
[102:25.97]During arguments?
[102:27.01]No.
[102:29.99]Yeah, in the orphanage.
[102:33.37]Was his act counter-revolutionary?
[102:36.87]I mean, yeah.
[102:42.53]Yeah, it was.
[102:45.55]I'm not gonna kill you.
[102:53.41]Alright, acquittal.
[102:54.51]Wow.
[102:56.23]That would be bad.
[102:57.21]Prison.
[103:00.58]Death penalty.
[103:02.08]No, I can get some points of revolutionary here.
[103:05.82]But I need to do... The common folk need to be appeased.
[103:16.01]The people want blood, but they're not going to get it because the revolutionaries will actually come and remove me from office.
[103:25.55]The joke fucked you up so bad.
[103:26.95]Yeah.
[103:28.50]It did.
[103:29.86]It's alright.
[103:31.72]Prison.
[103:34.32]Sorry, family.
[103:41.60]That could be anybody's name.
[103:46.06]I sentence citizen Claude Pochard to prison.
[103:49.64]Lead the condemned... out.
[103:53.59]He saved that priest!
[103:55.33]He showed mercy to an enemy of the revolution!
[103:58.83]He ought to have been killed, I have nothing else to say.
[104:01.85]Alright, correct, correct, correct.
[104:07.29]3 out of 3, good job.
[104:09.38]My influence went up, my reputation went up.
[104:11.58]I did- I played that pretty much by the book.
[104:14.30]So for the next case, unfortunately, I'm gonna have to play some politics here and we need- I need- ugh.
[104:21.16]We need to sway people towards, like, execution for this.
[104:34.23]Cool.
[104:34.47]This game's fun.
[104:38.21]I like this.
[104:38.87]This is actually really interesting.
[104:44.12]Okay, so I still have the- I'm still at the bottom here.
[104:51.05]Take him away.
[104:56.64]Is it as fun as Sekiro?
[104:57.90]I can't start Sekiro three hours from now.
[105:01.54]I'll be almost five hours into the stream.
[105:05.04]I can't start Sekiro.
[105:06.74]I'm gonna have to... If I start Sekiro in three or four hours, I will actually burn out for tomorrow.
[105:14.31]And I won't stream tomorrow.
[105:15.39]I'll be live for like 16 hours or something.
[105:18.41]No, I can't.
[105:27.56]Who's that?
[105:29.96]Who is that?
[105:44.83]That was dead.
[105:47.91]That was fun.
[105:48.89]One fool spewed out one word too many.
[105:51.83]The other fired a musket.
[105:55.80]They fought for freedom.
[106:03.64]each for their own.
[106:09.74]The man who was forbidden to shoot.
[106:14.14]Commander Buell paid the highest price for our decisions.
[106:18.41]The defender who kept watch over ordinary citizens, but was denied the right to protect himself.
[106:26.09]Whether I like it or not, his death is also my fault.
[106:33.16]Ahem.
[106:33.84]I... That's because I rejected the... We made a nice profit.
[106:41.91]There was a chance of prosperity.
[106:44.63]Why would the Renard family want to take over your shop, Grandpapa?
[106:50.43]For profit and power.
[106:52.02]It's always the same, and it's no different in these times.
[106:55.48]We get the same, like, hair energy.
[106:58.10]Coming to realize it.
[106:59.98]Today is about equality, so that not only the aristocrats can live with dignity.
[107:07.81]Grow up.
[107:09.05]Grow up, boy.
[107:10.15]I only saw the truth when they attempted to sentence my son, your uncle, to death.
[107:15.27]It suddenly dawned on me that the only things that mattered were the power I never had, and the connections I never cared for.
[107:23.27]You wanted to be righteous while the injustice spread like a plague?
[107:26.34]You should be not, you should not be sorry for that.
[107:28.84]Sorry, I misspoke there, Dad.
[107:32.30]No, this is my son.
[107:33.48]Who's this?
[107:33.92]Wait, who's the kid?
[107:35.44]Who am I?
[107:37.00]No, that's the kid.
[107:38.18]Where's me?
[107:39.34]Which one of these is me?
[107:40.52]That's me.
[107:45.08]No, that's me.
[107:51.49]Why does my kid look older than me?
[107:53.11]He's dressed like an old man, too.
[107:56.20]I'm not, but I would rather your brother live so that I still had two sons.
[107:59.72]No, this is dad.
[108:11.35]He looks different in court.
[108:13.41]You have a brother, daddy?
[108:14.97]Where is he?
[108:17.27]He died a long time ago, before you were born.
[108:22.49]Why did he die?
[108:25.79]Do not talk so much while eating.
[108:30.69]Your uncle went to war and died in battle.
[108:33.39]Your generation will soon realize the extent of the damage we inflicted upon the world.
[108:38.21]In the past, decent people like Pushard never had to worry about courts or tribunals.
[108:43.39]But now, do you even consider the possibility that Pushard was guilty?
[108:49.76]No, not Mr. Pushard!
[108:52.69]He was no guiltier than any of us, son.
[108:56.02]Keep an eye on the Reinhardt.
[109:03.48]Jim, when you stream games, do you stream with your monitor on or off?
[109:08.04]Uh, typically on.
[109:16.13]Oh.
[109:18.15]Yeah, fuck off.
[109:20.41]How does that sound?
[109:21.37]Fuck off, mate.
[109:32.51]very rare occasions oh hey why did you read that I don't know I'm sorry that was really funny I'll give you that one alright so uh let's read together it's been a rough couple of days
[110:01.81]We're gonna re-together.
[110:03.03]Some people are gonna think it's dull.
[110:05.75]No, no, no, no, no.
[110:06.65]Political debate?
[110:07.35]I gotta bring... The sun's doing... No, no, no, no.
[110:10.52]Political debate.
[110:12.32]Although, influence on reputation, influence on... Influence on the people.
[110:15.92]I need... I need Dad to be happy.
[110:22.19]What?
[110:22.53]No!
[110:22.93]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[110:23.53]Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[110:25.73]Oh, come on!
[110:26.55]What?
[110:26.77]They're gonna kill me!
[110:30.12]I thought dad wanted to debate politics.
[110:32.94]What?
[110:36.20]Oh my god.
[110:36.92]Alright, we gotta, we gotta kill, we're gonna have to just, we gotta drop the guillotine on somebody, I think.
[110:43.62]Oh, this sucks.
[110:45.52]What's my reputation right now?
[110:47.87]Ayayay is bad.
[110:56.35]Revolutionaries want acquittal.
[110:58.88]Common people want death penalty.
[111:01.16]I have to... I have to pee.
[111:04.00]Give me a minute.
[111:04.42]I'm going to pee.
[111:05.38]I also want to get some water.
[111:07.88]By the way, if you're not aware, I have a cough.
[111:13.04]Which, if you've been here for even remotely 5-10 minutes, you'd know.
[111:16.10]So, I'm trying to keep my vitamin C levels up.
[111:19.46]Stay hydrated.
[111:20.64]I'll be right back.
[111:31.76]so so
[112:27.52]you
[113:53.64]Okay.
[114:37.73]I drank a glass of water.
[114:38.59]I've just been in like a coughing fit this whole time.
[114:44.72]I was laughing my ass off.
[114:47.14]So remember when we played The Sims modded?
[114:54.94]When the guy was peeing and he was mid-piss and he sneezed and like his pee stream kept going and somebody said, that's fucking impossible.
[115:03.55]I was like, I don't know why I keep thinking of that.
[115:08.16]I keep seeing that image and seeing that person in chat write that.
[115:11.82]And it makes me laugh every time.
[115:16.14]Because I started coughing while I was peeing.
[115:20.14]And you know what happens.
[115:26.31]The fact that that sim was just mid-piss.
[115:29.07]Sneezing, coughing, and the stream was just perfect the whole time.
[115:38.63]Alright, let's get back to this.
[115:43.01]Sorry, hold on.
[115:49.01]Okay.
[115:50.97]Sekiro's out now?
[115:52.29]Comes out in like a couple hours, doesn't it?
[115:59.10]Anyway, here we go.
[115:59.64]This is murder.
[116:01.22]Murder.
[116:03.54]A tragedy occurred in one of the tenements by the... Oh my goodness.
[116:12.61]Fuck.
[116:14.09]I picked a great day to do, like, a talking stream, right?
[116:20.08]Like, not every stream is a talking stream, but a reading stream.
[116:25.38]Set your VPN to Japan, you can play it now.
[116:28.52]Yeah, but, I mean... I can't stream through a VPN.
[116:36.91]I can't stream through a VPN.
[116:38.15]What are you talking about?
[116:38.73]Why would I do that?
[116:41.31]That's fucking illegal.
[116:47.29]Alright.
[116:53.72]It's not illegal.
[116:54.52]Yeah, but I... VP... No, no, I'm talking about, like, pretending that I'm from Japan to stream the game early.
[117:01.34]That's... That's gotta be illegal.
[117:03.07]You guys would put me in the gay team.
[117:07.73]Yeah, no, I... You can't... I'm not sure that my internet is powerful enough to be able to stream through a VPN.
[117:15.90]I really don't think so.
[117:18.96]No, we're doing that tomorrow.
[117:20.20]Look, I gotta get more vitamin C and drink more water and go to bed early.
[117:23.50]Because tomorrow I'm going for like 10 straight hours.
[117:26.22]You heard it here first.
[117:28.56]Put the bulletin on the board.
[117:34.18]No, yeah, we're just hanging out playing this.
[117:35.90]I'm good here for a little while longer.
[117:40.08]This is interesting.
[117:42.12]We got a whole... Look, because I've been gone for like four days, right?
[117:48.32]I mean, I'm gonna play the absolute hell out of Sekiro.
[117:51.08]That's like the... I'm not gonna stop playing that.
[117:53.26]You know what I mean?
[117:55.51]I'm gonna like be eating pizza on stream again.
[118:00.85]But anyways, let's go.
[118:04.05]A tragedy occurred in one of the tenements by the Sein near the Pointe Neue.
[118:08.18]The fourth floor collapsed.
[118:11.15]okay the tenants horrified by the crash and ubiquitous dust ran outside only after a few minutes did some of the braver men run upstairs to look for survivors and remove the corpses Jesus rubble and timber buried two families 12 people three children managed to survive by hiding beneath a wooden table neighbors dug them out and carried them to the hotel dew
[118:38.12]We cannot comprehend what the orphans are going through, and they have not eaten or spoken for two days.
[118:43.66]Okay.
[118:45.42]The owner of the house testified that he had ordered the construction of an extra floor a few years back.
[118:52.43]Works were supervised by architect Maurice Lortie.
[118:56.47]The National Guard found the architect, who was also the construction foreman, at an address given by the owner.
[119:03.15]Maurice Lortie was not surprised when the gendarmes knocked at his door and he did not resist when they handcuffed him and took him to jail.
[119:15.99]So, this is like criminal negligence, right?
[119:27.03]Construction of an extra floor.
[119:28.35]Alright, let's see.
[119:30.15]There's four questions.
[119:30.93]Alright, so we got additional floor.
[119:38.67]So we've got... We've got the corpses, that's the victim.
[119:43.48]Collapsed floor is the circumstances.
[119:47.04]Oh, no.
[119:49.56]Isn't that the circumstances?
[119:50.32]That's like the additional floor caused potentially the circumstances of the collapsed floor.
[120:12.77]Alright, crowded flat.
[120:15.03]That's the circumstance.
[120:16.27]Okay.
[120:16.80]Yeah, I got it, I got it.
[120:18.74]I got it, I got it.
[120:20.28]Get a dictionary.
[120:21.28]I'm fine.
[120:23.54]Okay.
[120:24.70]So, common folk want death penalty.
[120:26.76]We have to sway towards the death penalty.
[120:30.02]The people are angry and scared and expect someone to be punished for this tragedy.
[120:36.76]Your name?
[120:38.42]Maurice Lortie, Mr. Judge.
[120:42.03]Do you build houses?
[120:43.85]That's right.
[120:44.85]I've earned my living from construction and renovation for many years now.
[120:49.07]Did the floor collapse because of your mistake?
[120:52.43]I don't know.
[120:52.83]I have worked at many houses since then.
[120:56.21]Those children are dead because of you!
[120:59.49]Let me just say that I always build the best work I can.
[121:05.62]Okay.
[121:08.22]Citizen, a few years ago you were assigned to perform some construction work.
[121:14.42]It was nine years ago.
[121:15.60]I was supposed to remove the roof, add one floor, then build a new roof.
[121:21.81]Is that a hard task?
[121:24.17]It is known that it is easier to build a new than to improve something already there.
[121:30.19]Did the owner have any objections regarding your work?
[121:34.00]If he did, I would have made as many corrections as necessary.
[121:38.66]Which floor was built by you?
[121:41.70]The attic, the fourth.
[121:43.22]Before that, the third floor was the attic.
[121:46.52]Hmm.
[121:51.99]Already, they're sharpening the blade.
[122:00.65]Citizen, with your knowledge of construction, what could have led to this tragedy?
[122:07.45]I can't be sure.
[122:08.64]Pests, poor materials, too much load on the structure.
[122:12.44]Every house is different.
[122:14.04]This should have been checked before the room fell on people's heads.
[122:18.22]You did not mention a construction error.
[122:21.33]Yes, unfortunately, that could also happen.
[122:23.37]I could have made a mistake in my calculations or wrongly assessed the quality of the timber.
[122:29.53]You are not denying it.
[122:31.88]If you judge that I have contributed to the death of those children, I will accept whatever punishment you choose.
[122:37.06]Two weeks ago, a disease took my wife, and I no longer care what happens to me.
[122:43.24]Oh, fuck.
[122:55.40]Did you talk to the tenants, the ones that pulled the victims from the rubble?
[123:01.02]They came to me in the night, angry and hurt.
[123:03.03]I understand their pain.
[123:04.01]I too have children.
[123:06.39]Answer my question.
[123:07.19]Did you talk to them?
[123:09.03]No, I was forced to hide inside my house and close the window shutters because they were throwing stones.
[123:14.41]So the building collapsed because of your mistake and you did not even have the courage to talk to the victims?
[123:20.34]I'm a coward, I know.
[123:22.76]How did they know where to go?
[123:25.12]I don't know.
[123:25.94]Only the owner of the tenement knew my address.
[123:30.84]Oh, fuck.
[123:31.28]We're about to prove... We're about to call in the witness and, like, prove... Ugh.
[123:49.01]Alright, but...
[123:58.21]The thing is, how long in prison?
[124:00.87]Can I say just like a little while?
[124:07.83]If this drops, I die.
[124:13.86]Prison's the most... Okay, I'm going to do prison.
[124:16.60]Just because it's... I'm corrupt as hell.
[124:21.50]But you have to understand something.
[124:22.84]They're going to come after me.
[124:28.68]Did the defendant confess to the crimes?
[124:30.40]Yeah.
[124:31.34]Kind of.
[124:32.80]Was the act counter-revolutionary?
[124:34.26]No.
[124:37.04]Call the witness?
[124:37.74]Yeah, but if the witness comes in and says a bunch of shit, then the people might not be so inclined.
[124:48.53]Are you the owner of the house where the floor collapsed?
[124:51.93]Yes.
[124:52.57]The floor and the attic collapsed and fell on the rooms beneath.
[124:57.96]Did the tenants complain about anything prior to the tragedy?
[125:01.46]The apartments were small, correct?
[125:07.11]Hmm.
[125:09.13]Did the tenants complain about anything prior to the tragedy?
[125:11.95]They said something about squeaky floors, but that's not unusual as they squeak at my place, too.
[125:16.47]So what?
[125:18.31]Did you inspect the floors?
[125:20.43]I planned to, but this tragedy happened before I was able to.
[125:24.95]Thank God he managed to take their money!
[125:32.61]So no.
[125:34.08]So he didn't.
[125:39.16]According to the witness, did the tenants complain about anything, squeaky floors?
[125:59.24]Alright.
[126:01.20]Prison.
[126:02.77]Death penalty.
[126:03.93]Prison is probably the best choice.
[126:05.81]Because he might not... Kill him for the love of God.
[126:12.07]But my conscience is at stake here.
[126:15.79]Squeaky.
[126:16.43]Kill is the best.
[126:18.23]But... Kill him because he's mad at squeaky floors?
[126:26.39]Really?
[126:27.19]Really?
[126:36.13]I just said something fucking horrible.
[126:53.84]Architect Lord, he shall be sent to the guillotine for the terrible, tragic death of two families.
[126:58.22]Long live justice!
[127:02.92]Incorrect.
[127:04.01]I did a good job.
[127:05.90]Okay, here we go.
[127:09.51]I got some common folk reputation.
[127:12.93]Let's try to make... Let's do the speech.
[127:16.79]Take a breather.
[127:17.63]No, I have a cough.
[127:20.77]It's been annoying for the last two days.
[127:23.94]Maybe I could win the heart of the crowd.
[127:27.34]Alright, they're irritated.
[127:30.48]Speak to the common folk.
[127:33.99]okay so the crime carelessness I would say carelessness right the def the so they're bullheaded right now aggression the defendant let's uh let's reveal this this is attached let's manipulate manipulate and then bullheaded we can do either aggression or humility aggression right
[128:02.61]And the crime would be carelessness.
[128:06.11]So that's the crime.
[128:13.84]I think that's good.
[128:22.03]Carelessness is the approach.
[128:25.81]Well, isn't that the crime?
[128:31.74]Let's just see.
[128:32.46]Attached.
[128:32.98]Well, manipulation again.
[128:35.26]Manipulation, manipulation, and then aggression?
[128:39.16]That makes sense.
[128:55.72]There we go.
[128:57.77]Yeah, I was right.
[128:59.43]That one would... This one was strong.
[129:00.89]This one would have been okay, I think.
[129:02.65]So now we're gonna do... So it's manipulation, manipulation, aggression.
[129:07.11]Let's go.
[129:10.21]Manipulation!
[129:12.75]Future generations will remember that we were not cowards.
[129:16.49]They will remember us delivering punishment for such heinous crimes.
[129:21.09]Alright.
[129:21.83]Defendant, manipulate!
[129:24.23]Will you just stand there and allow criminals to tell you what to do?
[129:27.73]And then aggression.
[129:32.63]You have gained power in France.
[129:34.05]Now spill the blood of those who oppose the Republic.
[129:38.45]Oh, come on.
[129:40.83]Oh, come on.
[129:41.75]What?
[129:47.79]That was perfect.
[129:49.05]That was strong, perfect, perfect.
[129:57.07]Is this justice?
[129:58.03]Will someone punish the owner of the house?
[130:09.63]Do I have to do it?
[130:10.65]Can somebody else do it?
[130:21.98]What's that famous line?
[130:24.78]The one that carries out a sentence should carry out the sword.
[130:28.80]Right?
[130:33.05]He's ours!
[130:33.69]Uh oh.
[130:36.66]Uh.
[130:38.89]There can be no more demeaning experience for revolutionary Paris than the escape of citizen Capet.
[130:45.85]He escaped, slipped right from their hands, and the revolution now seems feeble and weak.
[130:51.74]The people resemble a child that could easily be duped by anyone.
[130:56.40]However, the Republic quickly composed itself thanks to a postmaster and his people, who were able to catch the fugitives escaping to Montmedy.
[131:04.54]Ordinary citizens led to the fall of a monarch.
[131:08.17]You will have a chance to serve the Republic as well, for Citizen Capet will face the tribunal tomorrow.
[131:14.17]You will choose how he will be remembered, as a traitor and a coward, or as an unlucky statesman.
[131:21.44]If it were for the prison guards to decide, there would be only one outcome.
[131:30.54]Hmm.
[131:31.67]Allow the guards to rough up the Citizen Capet or leave him alone until the trial.
[131:36.71]Does this get me points with people?
[131:51.65]I'll get points with the people.
[131:54.77]I need those right now.
[132:02.27]Or the fair trial.
[132:13.28]Let's have trial.
[132:17.00]Get them out of here.
[132:21.00]Work on tomorrow's trial.
[132:22.77]Opening that at the theater.
[132:24.45]Let's go to the theater.
[132:29.41]Fuck, am I getting worse?
[132:30.39]I might be.
[132:31.23]This is bad.
[132:33.95]I didn't feel this coffee earlier before I started.
[132:38.98]Work on tomorrow's trial.
[132:40.04]I think I'm... No.
[132:42.06]I have to get this up.
[132:44.84]Evening with Grandad.
[132:46.54]Sit down with your father and listen to stories of days.
[132:48.62]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[132:49.20]Definitely.
[132:49.86]Definitely.
[132:54.69]We can lose some of that.
[132:55.93]We can lose some of the sun.
[132:57.95]That's fine.
[133:08.22]Listen to Grandpa ramble.
[133:14.14]There he is.
[133:16.60]The king.
[133:22.11]The people want death penalty, the revolutionaries want death penalty, the family wants prison, and nobody wants acquittal.
[133:33.29]Okay.
[133:36.89]My lord, should any reason appear, shoot the rebels without hesitation, just as his majesty ordered.
[133:44.06]Have no mercy, for they shall have none either.
[133:48.08]V. F. Bugleberry.
[133:57.97]Counter-revolution, treason, fraud, advocating monarchy, and neglect of duty.
[134:07.11]What's in here?
[134:09.47]You have some... Victory.
[134:13.84]This is... okay.
[134:15.94]Minus four reputation.
[134:18.44]Plus one revolutionary endorsement.
[134:25.12]My reputation is so bad.
[134:29.10]Any more notifications?
[134:30.04]Alright.
[134:33.70]Louis Capet, I hereby open you a trial.
[134:36.94]Answer the questions when you are asked.
[134:43.14]Capet is the name of one of my ancestors.
[134:45.21]My name is Louis-Auguste de Bourbon.
[134:49.55]That may have been your name before you raised your hand against the people you had sworn to defend.
[134:55.31]As a king, I have never done a thing against my people.
[134:57.79]I love them, and I still do.
[135:01.08]Objection!
[135:01.96]Ah, that hurt my throat.
[135:12.93]I'm just gonna say the word.
[135:14.15]Objection!
[135:15.45]There's evidence of Louis Capet's treason against the people of France.
[135:19.55]He should be tried as a foreigner and an enemy, not a citizen of the Republic.
[135:25.61]This is the audience.
[135:26.27]Questioning the defendant will Ster the impatient audience.
[135:28.69]Once angered, the people may even start a riot.
[135:33.44]I can't do voices.
[135:35.30]Drink some tea.
[135:35.86]I got something right here already.
[135:37.52]See?
[135:38.80]It's a brick.
[135:39.52]I'm just like licking it with salt.
[135:43.74]Let's read.
[135:48.87]Compatriot Citizen Capet, previously known as King Louis, the ex-VI of France, must be punished for conspiring against the people of France.
[136:02.82]Louis Capet tried to defend his absolute authority by plotting against the National Constituent Assembly and the people of France.
[136:12.76]We all remember July of 1789, he gathered an army, 15 foreign regiments, and ordered them to surround Paris.
[136:21.45]Soldiers led by Baron de Besseignois were to capture deputies and shoot at citizens defending the reforms.
[136:28.58]And so they did.
[136:29.78]The Royal Jerma Regiment drew first blood.
[136:33.69]After the plot failed, Louis tried to flee the country with his family and scheme with foreign Moronarchs abroad.
[136:41.96]Is that not the reason he took flight from the Tuileries one night in June of 1791 using someone else's passport?
[136:50.00]Was he not heading to Montmedy where his loyal armies were stationed ready to take him to Austria?
[136:56.62]If it were not for Postmaster Doré, the scheme could have ended tragically for us.
[137:03.31]Louis Capet will never abandon the thought of suppressing the revolution by force.
[137:07.41]Before the events of 1792, he gave orders for the Swiss guard stationed in the Tuileries to be doubled.
[137:14.05]He conducted a public muster in front of horrified citizens.
[137:17.97]The people had no choice.
[137:19.74]They had to act before Capet attacked.
[137:22.10]Citizens of Paris who tried to stop the madness were shot at, even after Capet's escape to the National Assembly.
[137:29.10]An evidence in order issued by Marshal de Broglie to Baron de Bensovat.
[137:37.20]God damn it.
[137:39.50]I'm starting to turn into dust.
[137:43.07]Alright, so.
[137:45.67]Hey, we got anything else?
[137:53.01]Acquittal.
[137:55.71]If I acquit him, I'm dead.
[137:58.94]If I press this button.
[138:01.21]then that's it for me.
[138:03.29]I'm gonna- they're gonna throw, like, a fucking spear at me.
[138:08.12]So, let's- let's start the questions.
[138:10.76]By- and by that I mean let's take a look at what we got.
[138:15.58]Oh, there's a lot.
[138:16.66]Ten questions to reveal.
[138:19.00]Surrounding- oh yeah, yeah, yeah.
[138:20.22]Suppress the revolution is an accusation.
[138:22.56]Doubling the size of the guard.
[138:23.92]Method shooting civilians.
[138:25.93]Accusation.
[138:27.97]Okay, defending his authority.
[138:29.43]Gathering armed forces.
[138:33.59]Attempt to flee the country is... that's a... that's a motive.
[138:38.27]Fake passport is evidence.
[138:43.04]Uh, no evidence there?
[138:52.91]Shit.
[138:53.71]I'm just gonna kill him.
[138:55.43]Fake passport.
[138:56.99]Okay.
[138:58.13]International plot is motive.
[139:02.54]How is that- How is- Proportional plot, not the motive.
[139:06.74]Isn't that like, the plot, ugh.
[139:15.27]Suppressing the revolution is the motive.
[139:21.59]International plot, you're accused.
[139:24.21]Suppressing the revolution is the motive.
[139:27.43]Is the method.
[139:31.37]No, that's what it is.
[139:33.09]Okay.
[139:37.05]Witness.
[139:37.43]Postmaster.
[139:38.34]Duray was a witness.
[139:41.00]Gathering the armed forces.
[139:42.26]That's a method.
[139:44.18]Surrounding the city of Paris.
[139:45.64]That is an accusation.
[139:51.23]Suppressing the... Doubling the size of the guard is also a method or accusation.
[140:02.91]that's also a method what's the third question there could be two here this isn't a game this is homework alright so this is making me feel tense this is making I'm gonna sneeze I'm trying to figure out how to do that without being annoying on stream

[141:48.28]No, that's... There are a lot of talented fucking artists that are here.
[141:52.63]I've said it before.
[141:56.83]Streamers stealing money from poor art students.
[142:00.99]Buy some pencils.
[142:02.59]And some paintbrushes.
[142:03.51]Some crayons.
[142:04.63]And some pastels.
[142:08.72]And some textbooks.
[142:10.00]Suppressing the revolution is a method.
[142:11.68]It's a motive.
[142:12.26]It's an accusation.
[142:14.36]Doubling the size of the guard is a method.
[142:17.18]Suppressing the revolution is a motive.
[142:24.25]It's an accusation.
[142:26.81]I'm getting fucking worse.
[142:29.09]Shit, am I really going to have to cut this stream short?
[142:35.28]God damn it.
[142:39.44]The itchy, you have to cough now is happening more often.
[142:45.21]Alright, we're good.
[142:49.25]I missed one.
[142:52.22]That's a motive.
[142:53.16]I told you it was a motive.
[142:54.16]Everybody said that I was wrong.
[142:56.84]Alright, who issued the order?
[142:57.99]Let's go right off the bat.
[142:59.23]Tough questions.
[143:00.31]You're on my show.
[143:01.67]Who issued the order to fire at the citizens?
[143:06.18]Either Marshal de Broglie or Baron de Bissenval.
[143:09.80]The one responsible should be the one standing here as he was not authorized to issue such orders.
[143:16.09]Really?
[143:16.99]Not according to this document it was signed by the Marshal.
[143:20.87]Marshal de Broglie, you went too far and lied to us all.
[143:24.53]I swear on my crown I did not issue that order.
[143:28.93]De Broglie is a sworn monarchist and was given an army to suppress the revolution.
[143:33.62]Would he work on his own without Capet's blessing?
[143:36.93]people sometimes do stupid things yeah has the accused ever considered Paris and its citizens to be his enemies absolutely not I asked that you explain the question
[143:59.62]can you deny it if you do not understand the question your army surrounded Paris is that not what you do to your enemies my soldiers were there only to ensure public order while the national assembly was in session adequate forces were already present in Paris was that not enough
[144:29.16]Who helped you suppress the revolution?
[144:33.02]Frederick William II?
[144:34.16]Francis II?
[144:34.99]Catherine II?
[144:36.43]Or maybe it was somebody that wasn't a two in their name.
[144:39.39]Maybe it was the guy with the three.
[144:41.71]Or the four.
[144:43.39]Charlie Four, huh?
[144:44.73]Was it Four?
[144:46.57]Justice awaits them as well.
[144:49.29]Nonsense, Oliphant.
[144:50.58]My only desire to take my family out of Paris as I did not wish for them to suffer house arrest.
[144:56.99]We all know the European monarchs despise our ideals of freedom, equality, and brotherhood.
[145:02.98]Am I to understand that you tried to prepare a joint military intervention?
[145:08.26]I deny any such accusation.
[145:10.06]There is no evidence for such outrageous claims.
[145:12.74]I would never turn against my beloved France.
[145:17.73]Liar!
[145:18.57]Ah, that hurt.
[145:21.07]I can only go so loud before it hurts.
[145:23.69]He'd sell his own mother, never mind his country.
[145:27.38]Ooh, wait, people want me to quit them?
[145:29.82]How does that make any sense?
[145:33.14]Wait, that's, no, the people are getting aggressive.
[145:36.80]How do I calm them down?
[145:39.58]How do I calm them down?
[145:41.80]Uh, people are aggressive.
[145:44.66]What do I, is it, what, am I like book?
[145:51.51]Do I have any way to calm them down?
[145:56.52]Let's relax.
[145:57.16]Let's go to an easy... Let's go to like a softball question here.
[146:01.84]Was he accused planning to reclaim his authority in Paris and re-establish an absolute monarchy?
[146:07.62]Well, that's actually very inflammatory.
[146:09.86]That's very inflammatory.
[146:11.50]Why would I do that?
[146:12.30]According to the Constitution... Yeah, this is very, very, very bad.
[146:18.56]Pick red?
[146:19.26]No.
[146:20.34]They're gonna fucking freak out.
[146:23.19]I am still the king.
[146:25.54]Then why did you raise a number of troops in the Tuileries?
[146:30.66]I feared for my family's life.
[146:32.26]It is not a mystery that the citizens of Paris were incited to seize the palace and capture us, especially as it was Mr. Danton's goal.
[146:42.91]It is clear, then, that the guard were organized against the citizens of Paris, many of whom did fall in the Tuileries.
[146:50.31]Against violence and disorder?
[146:52.19]Mr. Tinville, not against my people.
[146:58.15]Who is responsible for the delivery of the passport of the man called Pignet?
[147:07.78]My butler.
[147:08.48]I ordered him to prepare all the formalities regarding travel to Montmidi.
[147:14.02]The city hall has not received any submissions from your butler.
[147:18.39]I do not know what to say.
[147:21.75]Mr. Judge, Louis Carpet's butler was seen at the Austrian embassy.
[147:26.67]They sure took care of all the documents for the defectors.
[147:29.80]Hmm.
[147:30.78]There's no need.
[147:31.58]That is hard evidence, especially in light of what the accused has told us.
[147:35.40]Hmm.
[147:49.45]What did the accused plan to do with the constituents' deputies?
[147:55.18]Oh, we're getting close to a riot.
[147:58.22]Nothing.
[147:59.16]The assembly that I joined on the 27th of June, 1789, granted immunity to its members, and I intended to respect that.
[148:07.26]And yet you ordered your soldiers to seize and imprison the deputies, and perhaps even execute them.
[148:14.39]Nonsense.
[148:15.71]There's no evidence of that.
[148:17.43]My enemies spread rumors to get rid of me.
[148:21.35]We don't need evidence against a coward who runs from his own people.
[148:24.45]That person was waiting to say that for like fucking 40 straight minutes.
[148:27.85]They were practicing over and over again.
[148:29.35]They were practicing it in their head.
[148:31.47]And they finally had an opportunity to jump out and say it.
[148:35.84]Alright.
[148:36.42]We're getting the imprisonment.
[148:38.38]Call in the witness, Jean Doré.
[148:47.51]Okay.
[148:48.59]Introduce yourself.
[148:50.57]Jean Doré, postmaster of St.
[148:52.77]Manho, Monsieur Le Juge.
[148:56.47]Bad judge.
[148:57.49]What?
[149:01.51]What did I do?
[149:05.41]Did the accused Louis Capet introduce himself to the witness with his full name?
[149:12.76]No, he didn't introduce himself at all.
[149:14.82]He only produced someone else's documents.
[149:18.19]So he tried to hide his identity.
[149:20.61]You could say so.
[149:21.95]I used the name from the documents after he showed them to me.
[149:24.85]He never objected.
[149:27.03]Then how did you learn his true identity?
[149:29.99]By the image of the paper assignation.
[149:35.87]Then a messenger from General Lafayette confirmed my suspicions.
[149:39.97]I ran as fast as I could to Varennes to inform the authorities.
[149:44.93]Did the accused tell anyone the destination of his journey?
[149:49.35]Acting like a defector, was he nervous or in a hurry?
[149:58.15]I say, I say, I say.
[150:00.43]Foghorn Leghorn.
[150:02.89]That was pretty good.
[150:14.93]Look, there's a lot of like French names and it's hard to pronounce French names.
[150:18.33]I don't speak French.
[150:19.97]I didn't even take French 101 in high school.
[150:32.03]I'm gonna say... I'm gonna say the top one.
[150:40.82]Does anybody hear the end stream song?
[150:49.62]Did he tell you the destination?
[150:51.64]He asked for the way to Montmidi.
[150:54.04]I told him to go through Varanay and Aragon and warned the coachman to be careful.
[150:58.80]The road is difficult out there.
[151:03.75]Would the accused like to comment on this testimony?
[151:06.75]It confirms that I had no intention of escaping.
[151:08.67]I was merely traveling and it is the right of any free citizen.
[151:30.46]Bad judge People's patience has its limits the trial went on for too long and the audience was extremely agitated Okay, fine put an axe in his head what happened in real life Because we could just cheat right by using actual history King Louie
[151:53.27]the uh what happened to him he got the gate okay imagine if I just changed the history and put him he's still alive
[152:22.56]Oh god, that's so stupid.
[152:24.45]He's still alive.
[152:25.41]Alright, unable, there's no... Alright, just... Death penalty, get my reputation back up.
[152:31.97]Sign it.
[152:39.31]Everybody's on board.
[152:41.17]The crowd in front of the building is enraged.
[152:43.88]There may be soon a massacre.
[152:45.94]Oh god.
[152:47.64]A rumor has spread about hidden evidence of Citizen Capet's treason.
[152:50.62]People have gone mad.
[152:52.49]What evidence?
[152:54.45]I will go to them.
[152:55.29]I would ask you all to stay in your seats until I return.
[152:59.37]Uh-oh, this is bad.
[153:03.77]Why do I have to do this?
[153:05.77]People, what vexes you?
[153:08.43]Why are you so angry?
[153:09.71]Is he the one talking?
[153:12.17]The king lied to us!
[153:15.76]That coward ran from us!
[153:17.56]He'll surely run from justice as well!
[153:19.70]No, we're gonna kill him.
[153:20.64]I already did it.
[153:22.15]WE FOUND PROOF OF THE KING'S TREACHERY IN HIS SECRET IRON CABINET!
[153:29.71]Oh, shit.
[153:30.51]Okay.
[153:31.89]Citizens of this cafe shall not escape justice.
[153:35.44]Aggression.
[153:36.02]Humility.
[153:36.46]How many points do I have?
[153:41.36]Believe in me.
[153:42.68]I'm just winging it.
[153:46.94]Yeah.
[153:47.40]That... Like... He's not going to escape justice.
[153:53.19]The evidence from the iron cabinet will be examined, manipulate, and then believe in me.
[154:02.82]Humility.
[154:07.68]They're all withdrawn.
[154:09.36]Manipulate.
[154:12.09]Full aggro.
[154:22.26]All full aggro.
[154:25.92]No, no.
[154:26.34]This is aggressive.
[154:30.43]And then probably humility, because people are already... Humility and then manipulation.
[154:35.31]People are withdrawn.
[154:36.13]I can, like, do the dance, right?
[154:39.21]Or humility.
[154:42.83]I would even do humility with both of them.
[154:50.40]I have the points.
[154:51.46]Withdraw, withdraw, withdraw.
[154:53.10]Manipulate, manipulate.
[154:54.28]Aggression, manipulate, manipulate.
[154:57.12]Or, aggression, humility, humility.
[155:02.27]I'm doing it.
[155:02.73]Fuck it.
[155:03.11]Let's go.
[155:03.71]Yes!
[155:04.51]Yes!
[155:06.25]Yeah, I'm so fucking pumped up right now.
[155:07.85]I'm so fucking pumped!
[155:11.25]The king has been imprisoned.
[155:13.59]He will not escape a second time.
[155:16.10]If he tries, I will kill him with my own bare hands.
[155:23.05]Ah, doubtful.
[155:23.75]You're not that strong.
[155:25.36]Each new piece of evidence will be thoroughly examined.
[155:28.24]The Republic's standards demand nothing less.
[155:30.92]I shall follow them to the letter.
[155:32.76]Okay.
[155:33.94]I guess.
[155:35.50]Intrigued.
[155:37.62]I know that you might be angry, but you have chosen your representatives to protect you.
[155:43.47]Believe in me.
[155:46.81]Yeah.
[155:48.29]They bought it.
[155:51.22]+2 reputation, +2 influence, and then plus five common folk endorsement, we're back.
[155:57.27]We're back.
[156:00.07]So what happened out there?
[156:01.87]It is true evidence of Capet's guilt has been found.
[156:05.52]Really?
[156:05.96]Would the defendant like to explain why he concealed his secure iron cabinet and the documents hidden within from the convention?
[156:15.58]I hid nothing from the convention.
[156:18.16]No one asked me about the existence of such things.
[156:21.92]You kept your correspondence well hidden under lock and key.
[156:25.03]It could only be retrieved only the assistance of a master locksmith.
[156:34.23]Any affluent Parisian has a lockable cabinet.
[156:38.08]I, for one, am keenly interested in locksmithing.
[156:43.33]Let's go.
[156:44.29]Wait, is there more?
[156:45.05]Oh shit, there's more?
[156:48.05]No, no, no, no.
[156:51.48]What is all this other stuff?
[156:53.78]It's like a fucking bunch of papers.
[156:55.28]Alright, get these both out of here.
[157:02.70]What is this?
[157:06.16]Shoot the rebels.
[157:06.80]No, no, that's this one.
[157:08.21]What is this?
[157:09.09]The deputies of the so-called National Assembly are to be carefully questioned, and if any of them should display common sense and cease to support the Assembly, reward him with an extraordinarily high allowance and forward His Majesty's thanks.
[157:23.59]We trust that with God's grace and help, His Majesty will soon arrive within the imperial borders for us to grant...
[157:31.25]HM as well as our beloved sisters safety and to potentially take the steps necessary to really establish the natural European order within the borders of France His Imperial Majesty the Holy Roman Emperor King Hungary, Bohemia, Croatia, Dalmatia, Slovenia, Galicia, Lord America Etc.
[157:50.52]Well, you know country doesn't get to be added you're in the etc.
[157:53.94]I'd be pissed about that That's the you start wars over that shit
[157:59.21]AD 1791, 15th of May.
[158:04.77]And Your Grace, soon we will come to Your Majesty's rescue.
[158:09.39]However, for the time being, I implore you, YM, to muster local troops that remain loyal.
[158:17.63]I shall issue a warning to YM's subjects that any and all who dare raise a hand against YM would suffer the direst of consequences.
[158:25.97]My armies await my orders to curb the tide of anarchy in YM's country.
[158:31.46]Duke of Brunswick-Lundberg, Charles William Ferdinand, A.D.
[158:35.22]1792, 9th of June.
[158:38.38]that wasn't even a cough it's a pretend cough alright get them out there get them to the gallows let's go they've not how has the jury not reached what they think wait what must be pun try alright there's more there are new questions
[159:02.03]Louis Kippe tried to defend his absolute authority by plotting against the National Constituent Assembly and the people of France.
[159:08.38]We all remember July of 1789.
[159:09.78]He gathered an army, 15 foreign regiments, and ordered them to surround Paris.
[159:14.96]Soldiers led by Baron de Bessonval were to capture deputies and shoot at citizens defending the reforms, and so they did.
[159:21.73]The Royal Jerma Regiment drew first blood.
[159:24.99]After the plot failed, I just read this,
[159:29.88]No, I didn't.
[159:31.18]There was more after that.
[159:33.06]Whatever, we'll do it again.
[159:34.94]Louis Capet tried to flee the country with his family and scheme with foreign monarchs abroad.
[159:39.77]Is that not the reason for him leaving that one night in June of 1791?
[159:43.43]Who knows?
[159:47.56]Louis Capet will never abandon the thoughts of suppressing the revolution by force before the events of 1792.
[159:53.26]He gave orders for the Swiss Guard stationed in the Tuileries to be doubled.
[159:57.36]He conducted a public buster in front of horrified citizens.
[160:00.51]The people had no... No.
[160:05.53]The people... The people had no choice.
[160:08.51]They had to act before Capet attacked.
[160:11.20]Citizens of Paris who tried to stop the madness were shot at even after Capet's escape to the National Assembly.
[160:16.78]An order issued by the Marshal, instructions issued by the Minister, a letter from the Emperor, and a letter from the Duke.
[160:26.04]Let's bring it down.
[160:28.44]So, letter from the Duke.
[160:29.80]I would call that evidence.
[160:31.77]We've got a letter from the Emperor.
[160:33.39]Uh, what'd you call that?
[160:34.23]I'd call that evidence.
[160:35.55]You got the minister's order.
[160:37.47]I would call that... Hold on.
[160:38.93]Attempted escape.
[160:39.85]I would call that a fucking counter-revolutionary term.
[160:44.52]Or course of events.
[160:46.50]Suppressing the revolution.
[160:48.60]That's your method.
[160:49.64]That's your method to do that.
[160:55.54]That's the method.
[160:56.56]Ah, it's not.
[160:57.28]That's the course of actions.
[160:58.52]Uh-oh.
[161:13.99]And that's your method.
[161:17.07]Bingo!
[161:19.53]More questions, alright.
[161:22.74]Were you aware of the plans of the Emperor and the Duke of Brunswick?
[161:25.96]Why did you not... Why did you not warn the National Assembly and the Army?
[161:35.09]You need to speak up.
[161:38.47]I did not deem their threat serious.
[161:43.17]Treason.
[161:44.49]Allow me to quote you.
[161:48.12]My armies await my orders.
[161:50.42]Does that not sound like a serious threat?
[161:53.75]Prince Charles is impetuous, but I never once thought he would dare attack France.
[161:59.81]Alright, everyone wants him dead.
[162:02.39]Did the accused intend to lead the Emperor's forces to France?
[162:07.73]I certainly did not.
[162:10.05]In his letter, the Emperor was quite clear about his intentions to return order to France.
[162:16.89]I do not know the plans of Emperor Leopold, but I do know that I would never allow anyone to spill French blood.
[162:23.24]But you must admit that such an offer from an enemy government paints you in a bad light.
[162:28.56]Dear God, is it merely personal correspondence from my brother-in-law?
[162:34.11]It's not personal when the letters exchanged are by rulers in dealing matters of national security.
[162:41.15]Alright, let's calm it down a little.
[162:44.13]Oh shit, they're going to riot.
[162:55.98]He's got to die.
[162:58.49]Did the defendant confess to the crime?
[163:00.13]No.
[163:01.31]Who was corrupting politicians on Citizen Capay's request?
[163:06.83]Did Citizen Capay explain his reasoning behind Roland's mission of corruption?
[163:10.23]He denies the situation took place.
[163:14.11]And I don't know who did this.
[163:18.40]I think it was... Was it Roland?
[163:27.51]He literally just said it.
[163:51.14]That's a lot of points.
[163:57.02]Look at that boost.
[163:59.61]I, Sigward of Catarina, sentence Citizen Capay to death by guillotine.
[164:05.17]Take the convict away.
[164:08.51]Long live the people down with the tyrant.
[164:13.16]Oh, damn.
[164:17.54]Good job.
[164:23.69]Got some extra influence points.
[164:27.25]He's ours.
[164:31.23]Okay, let's go.
[164:31.77]Watch.
[164:36.55]No one's upset with me.
[164:37.41]Yeah.
[164:38.85]Everybody wanted it.
[164:45.71]Do they understand?
[164:50.10]Their excitement was stronger than the smell of the fresh wood the guillotine was made from.
[164:57.46]Do they know what's about to happen?
[165:02.00]Jerma versus Star.
[165:03.36]Sheep that only now realize they used to have fangs and claws.
[165:07.18]One thought guides their clenched fists.
[165:14.31]To bow before the new uncompromising idol with his shining steel crown.
[165:20.14]I too have felt their eyes on me, just like him.
[165:25.60]A silent assistant in this ritual of new faith.
[165:29.32]A random acolyte.
[165:30.89]Scared.
[165:31.99]Doubtful.
[165:33.07]Will not the old gods seek vengeance for this treachery?
[165:36.39]I was unable to understand their screams.
[165:37.89]I only tasted the stench of their sweaty bodies.
[165:40.45]But I could hear one thing perfectly.
[165:57.08]Bring us the king.
[166:02.52]Time for a speech.
[166:04.37]This one's important.
[166:08.93]Alright, so we have over-sensitive.
[166:12.55]Crime, revolution.
[166:13.87]I have points.
[166:16.74]So they're withdrawn.
[166:22.20]They're over-sensitive about the king.
[166:26.69]Which means we can do Humility here.
[166:33.56]Revolution.
[166:35.12]Manipulation.
[166:37.74]Full aggro.
[166:46.28]I'm not gonna do full aggro.
[166:48.84]Humility is better for Withdrawn, I think.
[166:53.44]Why would you use Carelessness?
[167:02.23]And then... Oversensitive.
[167:04.61]That's... Yeah, I mean... That's either... Manipulation.
[167:10.77]Aye, aye, aye.
[167:12.47]Alright, well... Defendant is manipulation.
[167:14.83]It's perfect.
[167:16.17]So, Withdrawn.
[167:17.17]Is it all... Nobody wants to be shouted at when they're Withdrawn.
[167:22.95]Maybe Carelessness?
[167:31.19]Maybe aggressive for the crime, but not aggressive for revolution.
[167:34.31]Maybe... I don't know.
[167:36.15]I would say manipulation for revolution.
[167:43.41]Crime, aggressive might work here.
[167:45.39]Aggressive, manipulation, and then... I don't know.
[167:49.80]Let's try aggressive here.
[167:55.66]Disorder shall be suppressed with the brutal strength of our truth.
[167:58.24]No turning back now.
[168:00.18]Alright, that was good.
[168:01.74]And then manipulation for the defendant.
[168:04.76]These offenders want to go back to the old ways.
[168:06.49]They defend them.
[168:08.41]Intrigued.
[168:10.61]And then revolution.
[168:12.79]Let's go with manipulation again.
[168:18.93]Aggression.
[168:23.42]These criminals think that because we are tolerant, we are also weak.
[168:25.86]That is not enough.
[168:27.12]Ooh.
[168:28.78]Speaking of not enough.
[168:36.28]Here he comes.
[168:38.12]I die as an innocent man.
[168:39.58]I forgive my enemies.
[168:46.97]For the revolution.
[168:52.25]Pull the rope.
[169:05.41]Do they ever clean this thing?
[169:07.77]Somebody probably does, maybe like once a week.
[169:12.32]I must be dreaming.
[169:13.64]Is that the map from the Muggler's case?
[169:15.94]You stole evidence from the court?
[169:19.38]I did not steal it.
[169:20.88]Only found a use for it.
[169:22.72]It will be more useful in your room than in the dusty drawers of the court archives.
[169:27.46]After all, this is a map by Turgo and should be traded with respect.
[169:33.71]What a lovely explanation.
[169:36.01]Consider it a gift.
[169:37.37]Now take it and try not to talk so much.
[169:40.47]You should be more concerned about the events with the king because this whole situation just seems particularly peculiar.
[169:47.41]As your superior, I should be the one judging Louie's case.
[169:51.29]I fail to understand why Rumpus Spear asked for your assistance.
[169:57.37]What, are you jealous?
[169:59.43]Of course I'm jealous.
[170:01.53]It is an important moment in history, and people will be reading about it for decades to come.
[170:07.40]People hate this.
[170:08.84]It seems there will be trouble.
[170:09.92]I have a feeling that someone is toying with my life, as though an unknown force were pushing me into utter chaos.
[170:16.23]Keep your eyes open.
[170:17.79]You came to the political world of the city from out of nowhere.
[170:21.95]And that means someone will have to step down to make room.
[170:26.67]Do you have to sound so defeated?
[170:28.80]My husband is a renowned person now.
[170:30.70]We should be happy about it.
[170:34.04]It is easier to shoot someone in the spotlight.
[170:36.04]Oh.
[170:42.40]Evening stroll.
[170:47.78]Whoa.
[170:48.12]We just unlocked one.
[170:50.36]Demonstration.
[170:52.86]Let them see real life up close.
[170:55.91]No, no, no, no.
[170:56.53]We gotta chill out here.
[170:58.37]Evening stroll?
[170:59.13]No.
[171:00.23]Hates that.
[171:01.59]Political debate?
[171:02.35]He hates that too.
[171:03.51]Paragraphs and codes.
[171:10.54]Family.
[171:11.78]Take a walk with dad.
[171:20.39]Let's just... Let's do a demonstration.
[171:23.05]Let's go see it.
[171:24.13]Let's go.
[171:28.94]Full bar.
[171:33.12]Full bar.
[171:42.28]Alt is ready.
[171:51.48]The people have shrugged the invisible burden off their backs.
[171:55.39]Their streets seem more peaceful.
[171:57.81]Even the windows at the courthouse were soon replaced.
[172:02.80]That's the whole day?
[172:04.04]Oh, okay.
[172:06.49]Oh, look at all these points.
[172:09.73]Dear Citizen Fidel, I am writing to congratulate you on becoming a part of our country's history.
[172:15.21]Citizen Capet's trial is on everyone's lips.
[172:17.65]I would also like to discuss the important topic of appointing the new Commander-in-Chief of the National Guard who will replace Citizen Burel.
[172:25.62]It is my honest belief that I am the best candidate.
[172:29.20]So would you give me your permission?
[172:30.78]I would like to pay you a visit this evening.
[172:32.76]Long live the Republic.
[172:34.24]Francois Henriot.
[172:38.28]Okay.
[172:38.50]Alright.
[172:40.36]So we have burglary, assault, theft, destruction of property.
[172:44.16]Okay.
[172:48.75]And we have people, revolutionaries want prison, common folk want acquittal.
[172:56.43]Alright.
[172:56.73]Let's take a look at the case.
[172:59.99]One of the two.
[173:02.80]But first of all, Juno.
[173:03.56]Juno Upsetto.
[173:06.72]Juno Upsetto.
[173:07.34]Thanks for the five community subs.
[173:10.06]Five subs.
[173:11.80]Just rifling in right now.
[173:13.78]Thank you.
[173:16.84]Really appreciate that.
[173:22.42]That was Juno Upsetto.
[173:26.22]Alright, so.
[173:27.60]We have...
[173:28.94]Alright.
[173:49.80]At the same time, Claude told his accomplices which expensive belongings should be taken and the group left the battered Fournier lying on the floor.
[173:59.29]Many witnesses saw the whole incident.
[174:01.27]Fournier's servants saw present during the events while some passersby looked through the windows.
[174:08.16]Okay.
[174:09.99]uh garnier not only admitted to leading the group but he actually boasted about it calling it a revolutionary deed of which he was proud he supposedly found out that fournier is funding counter-revolutionary leaflets and decided to relieve him of his funds the accused would not reveal the source of the information he handed the guards a lampoon of Ross robespierre claiming that he had found a thick pile of them in the victim's house
[174:38.36]Garnier claimed to having burned all but one, which he kept as evidence.
[174:44.56]When the guards arrested him, they noticed a gold signet ring on his finger that belonged to Fournier.
[174:51.45]Okay.
[174:52.73]Garnier often takes a stand during the gatherings of the Engrage, demanding that all wealthy people be hanged.
[175:00.19]In the year 1789, he took part in the storming of the Bastille.
[175:07.00]Okay.
[175:07.40]So...
[175:10.27]let's go so we have the there's a trap here though assaulting the victim is uh who's the witness here we have wasn't one of the servants one of the servants was a witness so that's one
[175:36.30]Freeing the bestial prisoners, that's a, uh, no.
[175:44.02]The gold signet is evidence.
[175:49.76]Uh, I'm afraid of a trap here.
[175:50.88]Break-in is the accusation, right?
[175:59.37]I mean, I want to see what happened.
[176:00.45]Hold on.
[176:02.13]He led a group of people.
[176:04.40]broke into the house of Dominique Fournier, a wealthy man.
[176:10.60]God.
[176:11.24]According to Fournier's testimony... Alright, so... Break-in is the accusation.
[176:24.89]Assaulting the victim is an accusation.
[176:30.35]I feel like the funding thing is a trap.
[176:36.57]Funding leaflets.
[176:47.90]No.
[176:48.61]Shit.
[176:55.57]We need more people like Garnier.
[176:59.74]Please introduce yourself.
[177:00.78]My name is Claude Garnier.
[177:02.74]You are accused of breaking into the house of Citizen Fournier, whom you then brutally assaulted and robbed.
[177:08.77]I led an investigation of his house.
[177:10.67]Viva la Révolution.
[177:12.61]Good!
[177:16.19]Is that what you're gonna yell?
[177:18.70]That's the reaction somebody has when they've been paying attention to their iPhone and are asked for a comment.
[177:25.16]Good, yeah.
[177:27.55]Who gave you the right to represent the revolution?
[177:31.34]The people of Paris!
[177:33.40]Sure we did!
[177:33.98]Is that sarcastic, or...?
[177:40.50]Uh, it's motive.
[177:43.68]Fine.
[177:44.34]No, one of these is a trap.
[177:49.86]Fine answer.
[177:51.22]There's the trap.
[177:52.24]There's the trap.
[177:54.38]Mm-hmm.
[177:57.74]That's okay.
[178:00.94]Alright.
[178:01.70]So, uh, he was beaten.
[178:03.84]Why was he severely beaten?
[178:06.26]He could have avoided it, yes.
[178:07.50]I punched him once or twice, but only because he kept squealing like a pig.
[178:12.18]Are you proud of yourself?
[178:13.79]He got what he deserved.
[178:15.77]Royalists are animals!
[178:18.63]He kept squealing when you were turning his place over.
[178:22.83]He was plotting against decent Parisians.
[178:25.19]Isn't that enough?
[178:26.74]We'll kill that dog.
[178:30.18]Okay.
[178:35.84]Would you like... Would you... Why would you think that the victim had anything to do with... You were found with a gold signet.
[178:41.37]Yeah.
[178:43.75]I have reason to believe that it belonged to the victim.
[178:45.63]Am I right?
[178:47.23]Why do you keep calling him a victim?
[178:49.38]He's a rich traitor.
[178:50.98]The true victims of the people of France.
[178:54.40]You know what we're talking about, and we will take care of him in due course.
[178:58.00]Now, what about that signet?
[179:00.48]Ah, yeah, the signet.
[179:01.43]It's nice, isn't it?
[179:02.89]Those swines got fat off our hard work, and they refused to give us a tiny part of their wealth, not even the tiniest.
[179:09.89]Huzzah!
[179:11.89]What did you plan to do with it?
[179:14.18]Nothing.
[179:14.58]Looked nice on my finger.
[179:15.76]Much better than on that pig.
[179:18.32]The signet was not only the thing you took...
[179:21.42]It wasn't the only thing, was it?
[179:23.62]I heard the house was stripped of everything precious.
[179:26.64]I was especially fond of those gold-plated candlesticks.
[179:33.51]Alright, well.
[179:36.33]Why would you think that the victim had anything to do with the counter-revolutionary activity?
[179:43.07]Ask anyone on the street, they all knew about it.
[179:45.52]Only no one had any proof and we were tired of waiting.
[179:48.60]How did they know?
[179:49.58]Did the rats talk to them?
[179:51.70]Well, I just knew.
[179:52.72]People always know what's going on.
[179:55.76]We always smell a filthy royalist.
[179:59.11]So you decided to find evidence of Fournier's guilt.
[180:03.03]Whenever someone's suspected of a crime, there's an investigation.
[180:06.05]No?
[180:07.11]We decided to do one.
[180:09.27]Do I understand correctly?
[180:10.27]Let me just make sure I understand.
[180:11.58]Do I get this?
[180:12.70]You assaulted citizen Fournier because of some rumors.
[180:16.26]Do I get that correctly?
[180:18.54]Mr. Judge, are you implying that Parisians are liars?
[180:23.22]I'm the one who asked the questions here, not you.
[180:26.67]The judge is on the side of the bourgeoisie.
[180:28.71]Uh-oh.
[180:32.47]That was a Family Guy tear joke.
[180:51.28]Oh, give me a break.
[180:52.92]Whatever.
[180:58.84]Let's get the witness in here.
[181:01.08]The victim's servant.
[181:09.87]Why did you not try to interrupt or defend the victim?
[181:13.98]Why didn't you do that?
[181:16.66]Me?
[181:16.96]Yes.
[181:19.77]I only said why.
[181:21.49]What chance would I have against a group of thugs?
[181:28.89]Did they attack you as well?
[181:31.81]Fortunately, they did not.
[181:36.49]It is clear that their aim was the bourgeoisie and not the common people.
[181:39.65]Did you call for help?
[181:42.01]I yelled, but nobody came.
[181:49.28]I yelled.
[181:55.28]I yelled.
[181:56.64]Why didn't you call the police?
[181:58.23]With the phones that don't exist.
[181:59.65]Sort of screamed out the window like they used to do.
[182:01.25]Alright.
[182:03.59]After you were arrested, you handed the guards a slanderous leaflet about citizen Robespierre.
[182:11.57]I found it in the Royalist Pig's house.
[182:13.89]There were scores of them there and we burned them all in the street.
[182:17.94]Wonderful.
[182:19.48]You did not burn that one.
[182:22.30]I saved it just in case, you know, I needed it for something.
[182:25.04]How can we be sure it belonged to Faunier?
[182:28.26]Where else would I have found it?
[182:30.60]Tell us exactly where you found it.
[182:34.06]He had piles of these leaflets in a recess there.
[182:37.96]Plotter!
[182:39.18]Scum!
[182:41.20]Why did you not go to the guard with the leaflet at once?
[182:45.29]Why would I?
[182:46.77]With evidence like that, you could be sure the accused would meet the guillotine.
[182:51.54]He's right.
[182:54.20]You should have brought the leaflet to the guard.
[182:57.56]They're on my side now.
[183:02.52]Did you really take part in the storming of the Bastion?
[183:05.97]I did.
[183:07.23]What a hero, one of us.
[183:10.37]There's just chat back there.
[183:12.97]It really is.
[183:14.25]Was your experience helpful?
[183:15.59]The only thing missing was Delaunay's head raised on a pike.
[183:20.61]That's another difference.
[183:21.53]I wasn't arrested for doing it.
[183:22.91]Everyone knew what they were doing the right thing.
[183:25.89]The Bastille was a fortress.
[183:27.07]We are talking about breaking into the house of an unarmed man, and that is why we have doubts.
[183:33.17]You mean an unarmed royalist pig?
[183:38.22]Alright.
[183:39.94]Common folk want acquittal.
[183:41.86]Revolutionaries want prison.
[183:45.13]how do I meet you did he confess to the crimes yeah counter-revolutionary in nature uh no what made the defendant famous in the eyes of the people he took part in the stormy the Bastille kill him as a joke I'm not gonna kill him I'm gonna put him in prison
[184:22.04]Nobody wants that.
[184:23.06]Prison.
[184:24.16]Acquittal.
[184:25.34]Ooh, wait a minute.
[184:25.98]Hold on.
[184:27.64]Reputation bonus.
[184:32.63]No, let's keep it normal here.
[184:35.31]Prison.
[184:36.41]Sentence to prison.
[184:41.19]That'll be balanced.
[184:44.37]Acquit.
[184:44.81]Acquit.
[184:46.33]No.
[184:49.83]I want to keep this balanced.
[184:51.65]I'm a judge.
[184:57.54]I'm a judge.
[185:00.70]I don't acquit somebody because somebody in Twitch chat yelled at me to like turn around and pick up the item.
[185:04.62]Actually, I do that all the time.
[185:09.47]We've changed entire game sessions based on what like three people have said in chat before, so...
[185:15.78]I sentence Citizen Glaude Garnier to prison.
[185:19.72]Lead the condemned out.
[185:22.08]What?
[185:24.88]Check, check, check.
[185:26.18]Good job.
[185:28.16]Reputation and influence.
[185:34.73]What?
[185:38.77]Good work.
[185:41.18]So I noticed, when I beat that guy up and sent thugs to his house, no one's done anything since.
[185:49.58]Hold on.
[186:08.85]Okay, that was a big juicy one.
[186:11.93]I can feel that one down here.
[186:17.81]Oh, I wasn't muted?
[186:18.93]I went to be muted when I said that.
[186:20.47]Fuck, my car, embarrassing.
[186:22.25]What?
[186:23.41]I got a hot mic.
[186:26.86]Your wife told me that I seek the support of just people.
[186:29.36]I should look for them in your house.
[186:33.10]Yes, citizen Hanria, my husband will be more than happy to endorse your candidacy for the post of commander in Captain Crunch.
[186:41.07]Why does this feel like a fait accompli?
[186:47.22]Please do not be angry at your wife.
[186:48.86]I am sure that they acted in good faith when she made those promises.
[186:53.48]How could anyone refuse to support such a respectable officer?
[186:56.92]I'm certain that my husband will acknowledge your merits just as I have.
[187:02.08]Undoubtedly.
[187:03.28]But how can I be so sure when there's so many other candidates?
[187:07.74]Well, I respect the other candidates.
[187:09.16]They are decent people.
[187:10.24]However, I can offer you the most precious gift.
[187:13.50]Money.
[187:14.42]Working together, we can greatly benefit each other, and maybe Barry too.
[187:20.96]Our family has a high regard for sincerity and loyalty, does it not, my dear?
[187:24.69]Moreover, we respect each other's boundaries.
[187:28.83]At every turn.
[187:31.71]Yes, those ugly rumors about you being an addict should be put to an end.
[187:36.28]nor that I never forget those who have done me a favor.
[187:40.38]Words, words, words, a lot of words, citizen Henriette.
[187:45.08]I am certain that no other candidate has asked for your endorsement.
[187:48.59]They do not think that you are worthy of their friendship, but I, Francois Henri, am different, and so are my words.
[187:58.05]I am sure that my husband has already noticed that.
[188:00.97]Thank you.
[188:02.58]Regardless of what the masses are yelling, Paris is only as strong as its united elites.
[188:08.15]I will not retract my wife's promises, but in the future, make sure you come to me first.
[188:13.15]But of course.
[188:17.76]Words, words, words.
[188:24.27]Okay, I need to hang out.
[188:26.63]Okay.
[188:27.67]Bernard needs to learn how to deal with stage fright if he wants to be a professional musician.
[188:30.93]You will have to endure an hour of racket.
[188:36.59]Opening night at the theater sounds fun.
[188:37.93]Uh-oh.
[188:48.57]But the wife is happy though, right?
[188:51.09]Yes.
[188:56.45]You don't like that?
[188:57.37]I thought you wanted to be a musician.
[189:00.79]Oh.
[189:03.57]Is that, like, me?
[189:04.87]Is that yours?
[189:05.65]Is that my head?
[189:07.17]Decapitation still had not lost its charm since the beginning of the revolution.
[189:11.05]A group of people were gathered in a Parisian street surrounding something on the floor.
[189:15.19]Your prestigious position allowed you to make your way to the center of the mob only to find a man's severed head.
[189:21.80]What had caught everyone's attention was that the head's facial expression, it was grinning.
[189:27.07]It was so unusual that the crowd stared hypnotized for no apparent reason.
[189:31.61]You wonder if anyone had thought to ask about the rest of the corpse.
[189:34.67]A lone severed head should definitely cause curiosity, even if for purely scientific reasons.
[189:40.39]And now you're staring alongside everybody else.
[189:45.90]Order the guard to get rid of the head.
[189:48.36]Leave scratching your own head.
[189:53.70]No, get that fucking thing out of here.
[189:57.34]Come on.
[190:00.04]The smiling head was removed and people dispersed.
[190:01.78]That's Paris.
[190:04.04]Yeah, I mean, that's absolutely fucking ridiculous.
[190:07.30]I don't want that on the street.
[190:08.20]I'm going to get booed for that.
[190:19.39]A Paris of a new era.
[190:25.48]Weak, vulnerable to attacks.
[190:31.58]Waiting for someone to reach for power.
[190:36.97]It's loud.
[190:38.05]Waiting for someone who, once again, will take control of its soul.
[190:44.59]The pawns are now in play.
[190:47.82]This is like Los Santos down here.
[190:51.02]Revolutionary holiday.
[190:53.09]Recent days have proven that Paris can win, that France can win.
[190:56.15]We managed to overcome our past, divesting our last remaining tyrant off his power.
[191:01.53]Now it's time to rebuild.
[191:04.90]To create symbols that inspire future generations, that is why during a gathering at the convention, several enterprising citizens proposed the construction of a statue to commemorate the revolutionary victory over injustice.
[191:17.01]You were given the honor of supervising the construction.
[191:19.71]There is no better candidate than the one who vanquished Louis Capet.
[191:23.57]You have an opportunity to leave yet another mark on Paris.
[191:26.11]Do I get to see what it looks like?
[191:31.48]Can you not speak these common words?
[191:35.14]I'm trying not to cough in the middle of them.
[191:39.84]Like I just did.
[191:41.18]Each section can be controlled by you, by an enemy, or by a neutral.
[191:44.52]They're opening up a board game now?
[191:52.11]Alright.
[191:53.59]Each section you take over provides you with one additional influence point.
[191:57.17]The chance of mission success is higher in your territory.
[192:02.48]Enemy agents can also take over your sections.
[192:05.88]Actions performed in enemy sections are less likely to be successful.
[192:10.44]Some sections are locked.
[192:11.78]Unlock them with any agent to carry out actions without them.
[192:15.96]To unlock a section, you have to scout it first.
[192:18.74]You can only unlock sections adjacent to the ones that you already have unlocked.
[192:28.71]each section reacts to the situation in the game.
[192:32.44]causing the fervor of residents to rise or fall.
[192:35.30]If the fervor becomes too intense, it could result in destructive riots.
[192:40.17]Jeez.
[192:41.87]So I have agents here.
[192:43.81]Send agents on missions, manage unruly crowds, and fight for influence over the city.
[192:49.27]Click an agent and choose the action you wish them to carry out.
[192:52.76]The bruiser is good at fighting and gaining reputation and managing crowds, while the diplomat takes over sections, nurtures relations with factions, and lowers fervor in sections, weaker in duels against enemy agents.
[193:05.81]This has opened up a whole new game here.
[193:08.55]You can move your agents freely between your sections.
[193:11.13]Unfortunately, in hostile or neutral sections, they can only move one space per day.
[193:17.58]So this is controlled by me.
[193:22.30]Uh...
[193:28.23]So does the red faction, the people, attitude neutral.
[193:35.55]What was this here?
[193:37.01]Lower the crowd's fervor in the section.
[193:40.85]District fully upgraded.
[193:44.34]Can I move here?
[193:44.96]I'm going to send a diplomat to the people.
[193:50.58]Lower the crowd's fervor, increase your influence over the district.
[193:57.36]What about down here?
[194:02.94]Take over an enemy section.
[194:08.19]Rafael Clovis is unlocking a section.
[194:11.59]Okay.
[194:19.13]There's a lot going on here.
[194:21.43]I still haven't moved up?
[194:22.45]What happened to you?
[194:22.99]Did he die?
[194:28.78]Oh, that was the... Right, right, right, right, right, right.
[194:32.04]I can't move up a slot here?
[194:33.12]Oh, I got two new people.
[194:42.15]This is not the guy that I just sent out.
[194:43.69]He's not... No, no, no, no.
[194:45.05]You guys, this is the... He's not dead.
[194:50.09]Is that guy dead?
[194:50.67]No.
[194:56.54]Alright.
[194:57.44]This is the main section.
[194:59.44]Let's go back here.
[195:00.96]Wait.
[195:02.66]I have something here.
[195:10.19]Is something in there?
[195:19.85]What the fuck?
[195:22.33]The more sections under your control, the faster the monument is constructed.
[195:27.05]Each subsequent stage of completion allows you to take over another building near the monument.
[195:34.52]Uh... I mean, I have to do the... Look at me!
[195:40.94]I like that.
[195:58.52]okay pedestal uh I don't like that pedestal no that's fine that's good why is the judge commissioning statues yeah it's almost like they added another video game here each building lets you perform a different kind of action take over the ones that support your play style
[196:28.77]Whenever you finish a stage of construction, you'll be able to seize another building.
[196:32.07]Why am I seizing my own residence?
[196:40.33]Spend more time with your family.
[196:42.85]Or facilitate the persuasions.
[196:44.83]I need points.
[196:47.21]I only have one influence point.
[196:55.50]I don't think I can do anything now.
[197:08.58]How do I get back to the judge game?
[197:15.53]Oh, okay, end of day.
[197:18.35]You're gonna unlock the battle royale mode in 10 days?
[197:21.51]There's a lot of stuff.
[197:22.97]Yeah.
[197:27.65]This game just came out today, by the way, if you're curious.
[197:29.54]A bloody beginning.
[197:30.40]A violent prologue announced by a flowing red curtain.
[197:38.04]the wrath of strangers made me sick to my stomach feet stirred dark puddles the air tasted like iron their heads someone cried anger hidden in the shadows thousands of cries from a single throat here was a beast with hundreds of claws and teeth what was that a monster
[198:04.07]A kicked, abused, and physically wounded soul.
[198:08.44]Their heads!
[198:09.84]What a cold and urgent order.
[198:12.46]The beast's eyes showed a long-disguised bitterness.
[198:15.96]Yesterday's envy.
[198:21.10]It has waited too long to show mercy now.
[198:24.08]Too long covering its ears while others laughed at its inadequacies and feebleness.
[198:33.41]The beast's bark was filled with a thousand smiles of those who worship this bloody morning.
[198:40.37]The day when their enemies will perish.
[198:42.65]Is this a metaphor?
[198:45.23]They're brothers.
[198:52.14]You think?
[198:55.50]It's just dogs attacking each other.
[198:58.52]This is murder.
[199:06.28]All literal.
[199:09.17]Alright, so let me look at this.
[199:12.05]Let's see.
[199:20.06]Bruno Hugo, 26, is a groom working for the wealthy and influential aristocrat Jean-Claude de Jacquemart.
[199:28.19]During a quarrel, he was seen to push his employer down the stairs, resulting in the aristocrat's death.
[199:34.99]It is significant for the case that due to his origin and low intellect, Bruno Hugo is known in the local community as a village idiot.
[199:44.65]The witnesses testified that Jacquemart had returned from a ride displeased with the way Bruno had prepared his horse.
[199:52.28]Apparently, the saddle had become so loose that Citizen de Jacquemart almost fell from his mount.
[199:59.36]The victim called for Bruno in order to scold him and began insulting and physically abusing the stable boy.
[200:06.57]When, acting on an impulse, Bruno pushed his employer away.
[200:11.37]As a result, Citizen de Jacquemart landed at the foot of the stairs with a twisted neck.
[200:16.95]The incident happened in front of other employees.
[200:19.29]Bruno Hugo escaped to the stable, where he was later found pale with fright and whispering something to one of the horses.
[200:29.98]Acquittal from the common folk and from family and prison for the revolutionaries.
[200:39.49]So we got some info here.
[200:42.39]Let's go ahead and start this theory.
[200:45.31]So, uh, twisted neck is... No, no, no, no.
[200:53.24]The village idiot is personality.
[200:59.88]Groom is what the witness does.
[201:06.50]Loose saddle is the accusation.
[201:20.65]Loose saddle, no, that's the motive.
[201:22.23]No, it's not.
[201:23.49]That's the method.
[201:24.13]Uh-oh.
[201:28.39]There was no motive.
[201:32.44]Hold on.
[201:38.39]God damn it!
[201:40.87]I'm gonna go, like, gargle with salt water.
[201:49.96]This is starting to get really fucking annoying.
[201:51.26]Alright, return from his ride.
[201:54.14]Okay, the witness testified that Jock returned from a ride, displeased from the way the Bruin prepared his horse.
[202:02.12]The saddle was so loose that he almost fell.
[202:04.44]Okay.
[202:05.78]So, that's the method.
[202:10.05]so then we've got uh return from a ride that was a witness right there's been too much learning on these streams recently shouts and struggle uh that's I mean is that method twisted neck is that's not an accusation that's not a witness that's not a motive that's the method right
[202:43.27]Like, if you break your neck, the method by breaking your neck was falling down the stairs.
[202:50.26]Or it could be a trap.
[202:55.18]Yeah, I don't buy that.
[203:07.05]So he was... The victim called for Bruno to scold him and began insulting and abusing the stable boy.
[203:13.72]So, Shouts and Struggle is the method.
[203:19.70]What, the accusation?
[203:25.18]It's method, motive, or accusation.
[203:32.42]Okay, yeah.
[203:34.51]Then, there's only three more.
[203:37.95]Groom.
[203:39.71]is the offender's personality.
[203:42.24]Oh, that's a trap.
[203:43.10]How is that the trap?
[203:45.68]What?
[203:46.68]The twisted neck method is not the trap?
[203:54.04]Well, that sucks.
[204:00.16]This is a simple case.
[204:01.10]The accused is guilty of murder and the only problem is that people feel sorry for him.
[204:05.60]What's your name?
[204:07.78]Bruno Hugo.
[204:09.10]I'm Bruno Hugo.
[204:10.94]Do you work for citizen Jean-Claude de Jacquemart?
[204:14.50]Yes, I worked there for a few years.
[204:16.20]Quite a few.
[204:17.90]Leave him alone.
[204:18.68]He's just a man-child.
[204:21.38]Do you admit to the murder, yes or no?
[204:24.12]But I... Poor thing.
[204:26.64]He's shaking all over.
[204:31.32]I need three more.
[204:32.28]I can't fuck this up.
[204:34.88]Twisted neck.
[204:35.98]There's no more trap.
[204:38.70]Twisted neck is the method.
[204:44.40]That he broke his neck.
[204:48.03]Shouts and struggle is... What?
[204:50.61]There's another one for shouts and struggle?
[204:53.49]Return from a ride as the witness said, right?
[204:55.29]Let me see this.
[204:59.61]The witness has testified that Jacques returned from a ride.
[205:02.53]Right?
[205:04.59]Right?
[205:10.35]Village Idiot Streamer.
[205:12.93]And then... The personality of the... Yeah.
[205:18.79]Okay, we're good.
[205:19.55]Because that's the personality of the guy that was fucking sprangling him.
[205:23.27]Okay, here we go.
[205:25.39]Do you know how local people refer to you?
[205:30.15]Bruno does not know.
[205:31.37]Does not know.
[205:32.01]Uh, Village Idiot.
[205:34.39]Do you wish to comment on this?
[205:35.62]Why am I doing that?
[205:38.16]Bruno does not like that name.
[205:39.58]No.
[205:41.47]Do they often call you that?
[205:43.87]Korra's mocking him.
[205:45.71]No, I... I don't like it, and that's that.
[205:48.11]I already have a name given to me by my mother.
[205:50.87]She gave me one.
[205:52.77]What is this?
[205:53.89]Was this nicknamed the reason you push citizens down the stairs?
[205:59.59]The master was shouting, and I don't like it when he shouts.
[206:01.89]I don't like it.
[206:09.75]Uh...
[206:12.07]Are you aware that you have killed a man?
[206:13.95]Do you understand that?
[206:17.17]I know.
[206:18.25]I just swung my arm because he was shouting at me like that so loud.
[206:22.27]Wait, I thought he was... I thought he was attacking.
[206:28.76]Were you aware that you could hurt him?
[206:30.22]I didn't think so, I didn't.
[206:35.22]Did you swing so hard that he fell down?
[206:38.70]I got so scared, I can't remember.
[206:40.24]I squinted my eyes, sir, and when I opened them again, there he was lying down there downstairs.
[206:52.09]He pleaded guilty.
[206:55.95]How did Citizen de Jacquemart treat you?
[206:58.71]He was good to me.
[206:59.69]Sometimes he shouted, but he fed me and was good to the horses.
[207:03.01]Good.
[207:04.43]How often did he shout?
[207:06.17]Sometimes he shouted, sometimes he didn't.
[207:10.07]aristocrat scoundrel is that why you decided to kill him uh first he was tormented by the nobleman and now by the revolution please call in uh please call in colin priest colin please call in colin please introduce yourself and state your duties
[207:37.35]My name is Colin Bouffieu.
[207:38.69]I am the major-domo at the residence of the de Giacquois-Marfois family.
[207:42.95]I saw exactly what happened.
[207:45.60]Please tell us what happened between Citizen Hugo and the master of the horses on that day.
[207:50.02]What do you think of the groom?
[207:51.64]Tell us what happened.
[207:54.06]Citizen de Giacquois-Marfois was furious at Bruno because he hadn't tightened the saddle.
[207:58.65]It could have caused an accident.
[208:01.69]How did your employer react to this?
[208:04.57]He started shouting at Bruno, tugging and pulling at him.
[208:08.33]Bruno pushed citizen de Jacquemart away, causing him to fall down the stairs they were both standing on.
[208:14.69]Nasty bourgeois.
[208:15.61]How do you plead?
[208:25.28]I don't know what I did wrong.
[208:26.56]I don't understand.
[208:27.28]These people wanted me to come here, so I came.
[208:29.88]I meant no harm to nobody, no harm.
[208:32.33]You're facing the death penalty for murder.
[208:35.25]Do you realize that?
[208:37.15]Izzy?
[208:37.87]I'm jumping to that.
[208:40.97]I just want to go back to the horses.
[208:42.60]I don't know if they've eaten today.
[208:43.86]If a horse doesn't eat for a long time, the master isn't happy when the horses aren't fed.
[208:49.30]Are you more worried about the horses than your own master?
[208:53.24]The master is dead.
[208:54.16]What can I do?
[208:55.26]And the horses are still alive.
[208:56.74]They're alive.
[209:14.88]Look at that.
[209:20.30]Hold on.
[209:25.10]Let me look.
[209:26.22]Did the defendant confess to the crimes?
[209:29.06]Yes.
[209:30.42]Was his act counter-revolutionary in nature?
[209:33.73]I mean, not really.
[209:35.93]What was the reason behind the argument the defendant had with the victim?
[209:39.73]A loose saddle.
[209:41.85]Does the defendant understand the indictment?
[209:44.85]No.
[209:50.35]He didn't confess.
[209:51.21]Yeah, he did.
[209:51.71]He said, like, yeah, I did it.
[209:53.13]He's dead.
[210:03.46]responsible for preparing the horses for the victim yes I combed them and fed them horses eat a lot of grass I combed them was the saddle loose um hello citizen no impossible I pulled the straps you can't pull too hard or it crushes and hurts the horse's stomach horses are good better than humans they did you want your master to fall off the horse did you deliberately leave the girth strap loose to get back at your employer
[210:31.93]I'd never.
[210:32.39]I liked our master.
[210:33.19]I wouldn't hurt him.
[210:33.81]I liked him.
[210:35.17]You can see that he's just a gentle child.
[210:42.21]People are aggressive.
[210:50.02]Let him go.
[210:51.76]Riot incoming.
[210:52.58]I'm not a bad judge.
[210:53.38]I just need to get all the facts.
[210:58.46]You still killed somebody.
[211:06.57]This one makes the most sense to stay balanced.
[211:13.95]Manslaughter, not murder.
[211:20.45]Balance or justice?
[211:29.78]The saddle didn't fit.
[211:31.62]The saddle didn't fit.
[211:35.66]Yeah, that's the best, for game purposes, that's the best option.
[211:44.45]It's a death penalty.
[211:45.43]Can you imagine that if I had done that?
[211:56.13]I find Bruno Hugo not guilty of the aforementioned crime, as he is unaware of what happened.
[212:02.17]What does it matter?
[212:02.93]A crime is a crime!
[212:06.17]You have to be careful with the likes of this one.
[212:07.69]His employer should have known better.
[212:13.65]Good job.
[212:17.02]Alright.
[212:19.60]Bad judge.
[212:20.22]I didn't get bad judge.
[212:21.02]I got influence points.
[212:24.20]Oh, man.
[212:24.70]I got to get some more water.
[212:29.95]My name is Jean Marie Roland.
[212:31.79]My name should not be unknown to you.
[212:33.27]After all, you wiped your shoes on it during King Louis' trial.
[212:44.37]Citizens are citizens, not king.
[212:48.57]King Louis Auguste de Bourbon, Duc de Berry, thanks to you flinging around half-truths and speculation, everyone is calling for my head, accusing me of corruption and treason while you used our backs as a stepladder on your way up the social hierarchy.
[213:06.62]Corrupting politicians does not always work out.
[213:10.00]Danton does it, Melville tried to, but they caught you.
[213:13.98]Happens.
[213:15.86]I will probably be dismissed from my station.
[213:19.06]I may even end up at the guillotine.
[213:21.50]But I will make sure your head rolls right after mine.
[213:25.16]You will be my comrade in misery.
[213:30.70]Threatening the judge of the tribunal is an even worse idea than supporting a despised king and corrupting politicians to the convention.
[213:38.52]I will get rid of your candidate for captain of the guard.
[213:42.98]Then I will go after you.
[213:45.74]It took me and my wife too long to get used to where we are.
[213:49.74]I will not die because of some over-boozed maggot that likes to call himself a judge.
[213:57.23]You will see how we wage war in Paris' salons, you treacherous monk.
[214:13.90]Dear comrade, I heard the news of Minister Roland's unexpected visit.
[214:18.38]I have to confess that Roland knows about me something that he should not have.
[214:24.06]I am certain he is already weaving an intrigue against us.
[214:26.42]We have to start working on one against him.
[214:29.36]Francois.
[214:33.97]Play something for me, son.
[214:35.79]No, that's the wrong voice.
[214:36.79]Wrong guy.
[214:37.99]I have work to do.
[214:40.47]Everyone gets the same voice.
[214:41.51]Don't you guys understand?
[214:42.97]As you wish, father.
[214:53.85]Support the construction of the statue Increase the rate at which the statue is constructed.
[215:01.86]Who cares?
[215:03.94]Opening night of the theater.
[215:05.22]No, I think dad's got to get happy here reading together Yeah, dad will think this is interesting
[215:19.23]Wow.
[215:20.61]Mom really liked that.
[215:22.57]A lot.
[215:23.98]We almost got four ulties.
[215:29.96]Ooh, what happened?
[215:33.40]Ooh.
[215:34.70]Ooh!
[215:35.94]Ooh!
[215:36.80]Unlocked.
[215:37.44]Uh-oh.
[215:39.54]Enemy agents will fight with your agents for territory.
[215:42.01]They can take over your sections or neutral sections.
[215:46.06]this combat.
[215:47.62]When at least two hostile agents meet in one section, combat ensues.
[215:53.30]Remember that a diplomat has little chance against a brutal fighter.
[215:58.10]After a defeat in combat, your agent becomes injured.
[216:01.55]They can still move around, but are not able to perform any actions.
[216:05.33]Your main section is vital.
[216:07.33]The buildings here enable you to influence the rest of the game.
[216:10.49]Protect it at all costs.
[216:12.29]If you let it out of your grasp, you will lose the game.
[216:17.15]I'm sorry, I didn't mute.
[216:19.51]Okay.
[216:21.89]Go fucking get him.
[216:26.87]Fighting.
[216:27.21]This is a diplomat, right?
[216:34.97]Revolutionaries.
[216:36.43]Construction of the monument.
[216:39.45]Why does the judge have his own militia?
[216:41.31]What's down here?
[216:44.79]Let's go take a look.
[216:46.88]Unlock this section, too.
[216:51.26]Now, this is a captain versus a diplomat.
[216:56.24]This guy's going to be coming out of the library with a bunch of books in his hand, and this guy's going to just walk over and shoulder tackle him, and he's going to go like, and fall backwards.
[217:05.74]I'll see to this that you hang, and he's going to run away.
[217:11.71]Easy.
[217:17.37]Okay, so that's good.
[217:18.85]Intrigue.
[217:22.35]There's more.
[217:25.72]The documents discovered in Capet's iron cabinet raise suspicions regarding Roland.
[217:31.12]The minister hates the tribunal for openly ridiculing him, and he will not forgive you for it.
[217:36.68]His intelligent wife holds an even stronger grudge.
[217:40.77]Number of successes.
[217:42.05]Three number of successes.
[217:43.23]Five.
[217:47.87]Action blocks.
[217:51.07]Perform actions correctly to fill the progress bar.
[217:55.44]If you carry out too few, you will lose.
[217:57.60]If you perform more than necessary, you will receive a bonus.
[218:01.96]Perform actions correctly to fill the progress bar.
[218:04.02]If you carry out too few, you will lose.
[218:05.64]Okay.
[218:09.86]The document's successful in tree.
[218:16.55]Convincing a witness.
[218:17.39]So far, there are only rumors that Roland destroyed the documents.
[218:20.26]If we find someone from his social circle to corroborate this, we would gain a powerful tool.
[218:25.66]We have a potential candidate.
[218:27.16]Philip Cote was among the people who opened Capet's iron cabinet.
[218:34.96]For an action to be successful, you need to persuade the required number of people.
[218:39.34]You can also send your diplomat to do it for you.
[218:42.01]Remember, you can only do this while the block is active.
[218:56.91]alright so you can send it it's two points I only have like three points what if what if I do it convince can I do this what is it like a certain chance that I
[219:13.01]Oh shit, we have a string of dialogue?
[219:16.39]Thank you for coming, Citizen Kote.
[219:18.48]How could I say no to a person who holds the lives of kings in the palm of his hand?
[219:22.68]I presume that our meeting is connected to Minister Roland.
[219:26.24]Exactly.
[219:27.54]I would like to talk about the incident with the Iron Cabinet.
[219:30.70]It is indeed rather ugly.
[219:32.26]The minister could lose his head because of it, although it is currently nothing more than gossip.
[219:38.11]yes but what if the gossip suddenly turned into the truth then things would certainly get nasty I want to get him what do you do to help me carrots and sticks alright withdrawn I want to get roland aggressive what will he get out of this manipulate carrot and stick carelessness bingo bingo bingo fuck
[220:09.94]Well, that was right, except for this.
[220:14.74]So, I think it's... This is not perfect.
[220:17.78]These are both good, but neither one of them is perfect.
[220:23.90]Manipulate would be perfect, but this one's not perfect.
[220:26.72]What will he get out of this?
[220:30.98]Maybe carelessness for this one?
[220:35.66]Will strong, strong, and perfect or strong, strong, strong convince?
[220:44.94]I wonder.
[220:47.48]Oh, humility.
[220:48.12]I'm going to do aggression, manipulation, and humility.
[220:55.96]Here we go.
[220:58.55]I need Roland's head.
[220:59.61]He is a pest.
[221:00.49]By bribing politicians, he has harmed all of France.
[221:04.09]We need the witness that saw him opening the iron chest to reveal his identity.
[221:07.16]We need you, Sybilzen.
[221:10.72]Roland has his vices, but are they enough to justify my betrayal?
[221:14.34]Because that is what you ask of me.
[221:18.36]Manipulation.
[221:20.85]Minister Roland will not save you when matters become troublesome.
[221:25.71]I can save you from charges of complicity, for example, other things.
[221:32.39]Alright, and then humility.
[221:35.77]I believe that you are a man of reason, Citizen Coat.
[221:38.63]Listening to it telling you that you do not want to pay for Roland's mistakes, and I do not want to make you pay for them.
[221:45.30]Got it.
[221:47.60]I will help you and testify against him.
[221:49.98]Let us see where this leads.
[221:51.42]But hopefully to you, hopefully to my head staying on my neck as you promised.
[222:02.52]Got it.
[222:08.73]Thank you.
[222:09.91]Oh god, spreading rumors.
[222:12.40]Choose how to resolve this.
[222:14.20]Some actions require you to make decisions about tactics.
[222:16.46]Each decision may have a different chance of success.
[222:23.27]Um, what is this one?
[222:26.35]Court guard Rafael Clovis, your loyal subordinate, will have to talk some sense into a few heads so they realize how big a threat Roland is, or a few casual remarks made by the respected Jacques-Louis David should unleash an avalanche.
[222:42.06]Chance of success is 10%.
[222:43.06]Or plus 10%.
[222:45.40]That's not gonna... 10% chance?
[222:46.36]Or is that added on top?
[223:00.75]I don't think it's worth doing.
[223:05.01]We'll do, ah, diplomacy.
[223:08.95]Intrigues are carried out in a matter of days.
[223:10.71]The results of some action blocks may only be seen the next day.
[223:13.45]So that's plus 10%, okay.
[223:20.57]Okay, how is it a failed intrigue?
[223:23.77]I think we're good.
[223:26.85]Added from the one before, okay?
[223:28.13]What happened here?
[223:29.03]They're just, they're fighting.
[223:29.77]Alright, we'll end the day.
[223:43.92]It's a cool game, it is.
[223:44.76]Alright, here we go.
[223:48.05]Revolutionaries want the death penalty and common folk want acquittal.
[223:54.69]He fell in love with Marie Antoinette.
[223:57.47]Are you Mr. Antoine Barnave?
[224:03.52]I am.
[224:05.20]Did you and your mistress Marie Antoinette plot against France?
[224:09.62]There are so many lies in your... No, wait, wrong.
[224:13.98]There are so many lies in your question that I cannot decide which one to deny first.
[224:19.05]He tries to defend himself with pretty words.
[224:22.75]So are you not pleading guilty?
[224:31.33]Your highness I'm certain that our shared efforts will convince the people of France to preserve the monarchy The loss of your wisdom and kindness would be too tragic a blow for the state to afford yours Antoine Treason advocating monarchy and counter-revolution
[224:57.78]The defendant is Antoine Barnave.
[225:01.03]A 32?
[225:01.89]That's... Oh, he's wearing a wig.
[225:12.32]A 32-year-old politician and famous orator.
[225:16.42]Parisians remember him for his fiery speech defending the constitutional... The constitu...
[225:24.62]the Constitutional Monarchy.
[225:26.90]He is known as a fierce enemy of the Republic and protector of the King.
[225:30.26]Seeing that his political efforts were fruitless, he joined the National Guard.
[225:34.43]Excuse me.
[225:42.25]In 1791, during the notorious flight to Varens, the Capets were detained by the Guard.
[225:49.33]Antoine Barnave and two other soldiers were ordered to escort the fugitives back to Paris.
[225:55.87]When Barnave met Marie Antoinette, he was absolutely charmed.
[226:00.53]The two developed a potentially sexual relationship.
[226:05.37]Later, they were frequently writing to each other.
[226:08.00]In her letters, Marie Antoinette often expressed hope for the survival of absolute monarchy.
[226:14.08]Not long after, Barnave joined the Jacobins, hoping to help the Capets and alleviate the radical approach of the revolutionaries towards citizen Capet and Marie Antoinette.
[226:23.14]His efforts, however, were futile.
[226:26.12]Due to his sympathy towards the monarchy and the Capets, especially Marie Antoinette, he was under constant surveillance.
[226:33.05]Now we have finally managed to collect enough evidence against him to file an indictment.
[226:37.75]One of the pieces of evidence is his correspondence with Marie Antoinette, which potentially proves his countered revolutionary tendencies.
[226:45.31]Antoine Barnave ought to be punished like any other enemy of the revolution.
[226:50.15]And the evidence is a letter Barnave wrote to Marie Antoinette.
[226:54.18]okay so famous order order to escort the fugitives back to Paris okay met Marie antoinette was absolutely charmed they developed a relationship they write back and forth had some sympathy towards the monarchy and wrote some letters okay so famous order that's a personality
[227:24.30]We have letters addressed to Marie Antoinette.
[227:26.99]That's evidence.
[227:28.87]Sympathy towards the monarchs.
[227:30.53]That's the not motive.
[227:34.83]That's personality.
[227:35.91]Or counter-revolution.
[227:37.53]Charmed by the queen.
[227:39.07]That's what we like to call a... Marie Antoinette.
[227:51.00]That's it.
[227:52.60]Okay, four more questions.
[227:55.09]Let us address to me... This is evidence?
[227:56.80]No, this is the, uh... That's the motive.
[227:59.94]Right?
[228:01.42]Personality.
[228:02.88]Fuck.
[228:08.61]Escorting citizen Capay.
[228:11.33]That is... motive.
[228:13.77]Dude.
[228:15.91]God damn it, hold on.
[228:31.63]I didn't even need to click that.
[228:48.50]Okay, after this, I gotta get some fucking water.
[228:53.69]Get some fucking salt.
[228:57.72]I can't make any more mistakes though, so we've got... This is just letters addressed to Marie Antoinette.
[229:04.20]It's extenuating circumstances.
[229:10.48]Marie Antoinette is the motive?
[229:12.24]Hold on.
[229:17.13]Yeah, he's either too developed to say it that way, or they were frequently in writings rather than letters, and Marie Antoinette opens to express hope for the survival of absolute monarchy, right?
[229:24.30]And then the evidence of the letter is that he wrote to Marie Antoinette.
[229:32.71]Ow.
[229:34.79]Replenish your electrolytes.
[229:36.01]Yeah, I'm going to.
[229:37.79]Unfortunately, this stream is going to probably cut short.
[229:42.31]Because this is really starting to cause me anguish.
[229:50.04]Charmed by the Queen.
[229:51.04]I don't know if that's motive or just extenuating.
[230:00.07]No, absolutely, I'm not going to not stream Sekiro tomorrow.
[230:02.94]Are you kidding me?
[230:05.40]If anything, I want to get ready for it.
[230:07.16]I want to get some rest and save my throat.
[230:13.70]I'm not going to play Sekiro off stream.
[230:15.36]Oh my god, I've been waiting for it for so long.
[230:18.29]That's motive.
[230:32.63]Well, she was fucking playing him.
[230:37.41]She was playing him.
[230:42.02]Whatever.
[230:42.74]I can... This guy's done.
[230:45.64]I don't need this shit.
[230:50.84]Alright.
[230:51.12]Not long ago, you were on the path to a grand career.
[230:53.08]I remember your famous speech in defense of Citizen Kapai.
[230:56.41]Your charisma could have taken you to the top, but instead you are here.
[230:59.23]Do you not regret it?
[231:01.62]That speech was not aimed against the revolution.
[231:03.90]I only wish to appeal to common sense.
[231:07.24]Many remember that performance as an attack on everything that started in France on July 14th.
[231:14.53]Nonsense.
[231:15.57]The changes were essential.
[231:18.19]Constitutional monarchy is a reasonable alternative to the old order.
[231:23.21]So, in your opinion, people who brought misery to France should continue living in the palace?
[231:28.38]I do not think they should be guillotined only for their ancestry.
[231:36.45]Did you ever express your feelings to Marie Antoinette in your letters?
[231:40.59]Did you not read our letters carefully?
[231:43.24]I would not have dared to woo the Queen of France.
[231:47.42]You wrote about her wisdom and kindness.
[231:49.28]It sounds like you were paying her compliments.
[231:52.42]Those were just pleasantries.
[231:55.36]Maybe she was wooing him.
[231:57.06]The Austrian whore was insatiable.
[232:02.02]Kill him.
[232:07.78]It would appear that in your letters, Marie Antoinette, you tried to convince her and her husband to support the revolution.
[232:15.82]What would you gain from that?
[232:18.79]I believe that we would avert the terror we were currently facing.
[232:22.99]Why do you think there's terror in our country?
[232:25.75]I would not be standing here now otherwise.
[232:28.99]You're there because you're a royal swine!
[232:32.50]The Capets were not interested in the Constitution?
[232:35.40]Unfortunately not.
[232:37.36]And how would you benefit from it?
[232:39.56]I only... Did I catch that?
[232:43.12]I think I did.
[232:43.94]I only wanted what was best for my country.
[232:49.44]Were you not afraid to openly support the monarchs on the eve of the revolution?
[232:53.97]That could be interpreted as treason.
[232:57.35]I may be young and idealistic, but I'm no traitor.
[233:01.07]If that were true, you'd be standing on the right side.
[233:04.71]I love this country, and I'm certain that the republic which the revolutionaries are fighting for is not a panacea.
[233:15.28]If you fight the republic, you fight France itself.
[233:17.76]What is it, snowing?
[233:35.10]French YouTuber voice.
[234:09.71]I'm sick of listening to your shit.
[234:11.41]We already saw this movie.
[234:13.02]I've no further questions, thank you.
[234:14.56]I sentence citizen Antoine Byron to death by de-gag-geek-ting.
[234:18.72]That's how every court should operate, swift and bold.
[234:24.29]And does it matter what we have to say?
[234:25.95]You'd better take us into account in the future.
[234:31.51]Look, it's all balanced.
[234:36.15]Enemy at the courthouse.
[234:38.47]The jury noticed you making the wrong choices and forgoing justice.
[234:41.47]The rumors spread fast.
[234:42.52]That's what happened in reality.
[234:46.02]I'm basing my shit on the book.
[234:47.94]You can adapt your Game of Thrones season fucking seven however you want.
[234:51.98]You can change the ending.
[234:53.52]Not me.
[234:53.92]I'm going right to the books.
[235:05.54]Hey guys, welcome back to part 143 of my YouTube series.
[235:08.34]Today we're going to get sentenced to death for supporting the monarchy.
[235:13.73]Agent, you ordered me to silence.
[235:15.77]It is done, but there is something you need to see for yourself.
[235:18.39]Who is this?
[235:28.47]Alright, speak to the common folk.
[235:32.69]Carefree for the crime.
[235:35.61]So should I be careless with this?
[235:37.81]Whatever.
[235:39.59]They're oversensitive about the defendant.
[235:44.80]Carelessness.
[235:46.36]They're oversensitive, so we can do some humility here.
[235:51.12]And then Revolution.
[235:52.26]Let's go straight up aggressive.
[235:56.54]Perfect.
[235:57.46]Strong.
[235:59.64]And Revolution.
[236:05.32]Manipulate or humility?
[236:13.83]Probably manipulate.
[236:19.63]Careless, humility, and manipulate.
[236:26.61]For this convict here, killing was as easy as breathing.
[236:29.98]That's how this guillotine is to us.
[236:34.12]I tell him, joke.
[236:35.44]Humility.
[236:36.46]The criminals belong in the grave, only then we can build a better future.
[236:39.68]Yes.
[236:41.36]And then, manipulation.
[236:43.90]Future generations will remember that we were not cowards, it needs to be done.
[236:48.13]And everyone's happy.
[236:51.51]Reputation plus three.
[236:56.58]I performed my duties when the king was equal to France, and this is how France repays me.
[237:13.42]Boo.
[237:13.98]For the revolution.
[237:15.12]Boo.
[237:15.68]Why are you guys booing me?
[237:26.29]That guy's usually happy.
[237:27.86]Oh, he didn't get a good seat this time.
[237:30.50]He didn't get here quick enough.
[237:38.58]Do you want to show me a common dead body?
[237:41.93]It's not just a dead body.
[237:44.01]Look at that necklace.
[237:44.85]It's Winston.
[237:48.21]A fleur de lis.
[237:49.05]That's the Winston voice actor.
[237:50.29]There's more hidden under his clothes.
[237:54.96]We found a message in the inner pocket of his cloak.
[237:57.44]No, it's not.
[237:58.00]It's an order.
[237:59.46]Someone told that man to build support for a mysterious R in the district.
[238:06.13]Who is arrogant enough to take Louis' place?
[238:08.51]You guys thought my French accents weren't good.
[238:10.37]Only aristocrats are powerful enough to secretly organize people like him.
[238:13.96]These guys have an American accent.
[238:17.16]I'm at least in the same hemisphere.
[238:18.06]Even they would need help from someone in the convention.
[238:20.84]So who is R?
[238:23.93]Robespierre, maybe?
[238:25.28]If he's allying with aristocrats, we must tell someone.
[238:29.08]Everyone.
[238:32.26]It could be Minister Roland.
[238:34.70]As long as we are not sure, we would only create panic.
[238:40.04]If that's the case, we'll have to hunt down other agents.
[238:43.56]This one won't be telling us anything.
[238:45.72]We have no other choice.
[238:49.17]If this R is trying to gain support, you must do the same for the greater good.
[238:54.65]It's that Rob's Pierre guy.
[238:57.80]He's at the top.
[239:00.40]When are they gonna add vibe support?
[239:04.04]The evening is warm, so you decide to take the long way home.
[239:06.46]Near the Café Chantilly, you spot an amusing scene.
[239:09.42]Two drunkards fighting over a bottle of liquor, cursing like stable boys.
[239:13.48]The first is shorter and dressed in a disheveled officer's uniform, possibly a colonel.
[239:17.45]The second fighter, although significantly taller, is just an ordinary street thug.
[239:21.95]You listen to the gibberish and tangled epithies, only to reach the conclusion that the bottle contains one last gulp of drink.
[239:31.51]Try to settle the dispute between the drunkards.
[239:35.47]The two enemies unite in the face of a stranger in an elegant coat.
[239:38.73]It surely looks comical to the observers when, in a fit of booze-driven solidarity, one tries to hit you in the head with the disputed object, while the other kicks at your ankle.
[239:48.62]You dodge the bottle, which smashes on a nearby wall, spilling the remaining alcohol everywhere.
[239:53.62]However, the kick is a success and immobilizes you long enough for the drunkards to disappear down a back alley.
[240:00.07]It takes some time for the bystanders to stop laughing.
[240:03.13]And I'm a judge, and I could literally... I could have your tongue out.
[240:22.29]Should I do this?
[240:22.81]Or should I do this?
[240:26.46]Evening Stroll.
[240:27.22]No, we're gonna... Everyone's doing so good.
[240:30.79]Evening with Grandfather.
[240:32.27]Yeah.
[240:34.77]It's okay to lose points here.
[240:37.79]He's hard to please.
[240:38.79]That's an entire evening with Grandpa?
[240:42.69]And it's not even a centimeter?
[240:50.29]Dead.
[240:50.91]I win.
[240:56.38]Why is this on fire?
[240:59.02]Riots block agents except the bruiser and prevent you from gaining influence points from the section.
[241:05.07]When not quelled, riots make a section neutral and can quickly spread.
[241:10.75]Get in there.
[241:15.45]This is... okay.
[241:18.15]Let's head back.
[241:21.36]Increase your influence.
[241:26.40]Just increasing points over here.
[241:28.42]Jerma lied about Minecraft VR.
[241:30.14]Five community subs.
[241:31.16]Thank you.
[241:32.44]For the five subs.
[241:34.52]Let's try to quell the unrest here.
[241:40.00]But did you... Hold on.
[241:43.42]Your name used to be in all lowercase.
[241:46.24]Didn't it?
[241:48.47]Did you change your name to add uppercase letters?
[241:54.89]That's what you did.
[241:59.06]Why?
[241:59.40]Alright, I'll be right back.
[242:02.84]And I actually... I'm probably gonna have to stop here.
[242:07.74]I'm sorry.
[242:10.84]I'm getting raw in the back.
[242:14.37]Sorry if I like the four to five hour stream.
[242:18.37]Hold on.
[242:23.61]I just... It's starting to hurt.
[242:27.19]Uh, let me, let me, hold on.
[242:28.17]No, I'm not gonna say that yet.
[242:29.11]Let me go get some, like, I'm gonna gargle some salt water and, like, have a drink of water.
[242:33.17]And let me just see how I am in, like, two minutes.
[242:34.67]I'll be right back.
[242:43.86]And yes, regardless, Sekiro is tomorrow.
[242:45.54]Sekiro tomorrow.
[242:48.50]Probably all day.
[242:50.46]From the moment I get up, I don't know when the stream's gonna start.
[242:53.28]But I'm just gonna play the absolute hell out of it.
[242:58.70]I'll be right back.
[242:59.24]We'll see in a second.
[243:04.98]Too sick for Sekiro tomorrow, guaranteed.
[243:06.90]No way.
[243:07.56]I've been waiting too long to play this.
[243:09.46]No, that's not going to happen.
[243:11.27]I don't care if I have to mute myself.
[243:14.17]It'll be like a no talking stream.
[243:17.77]I'll be right back.
[246:13.09]alright hooray cough syrup is coming in rejoicing but I uh I am gonna just call it I was down there talking to Kim and I've decided that it's probably for the best
[246:35.29]Because if I, like, keep going, I keep talking and keep, like, irritating the area that I... Tomorrow's Sekiro.
[246:42.96]You know what I'm saying?
[246:44.30]Like, I want to be fucking ready to go completely all day.
[246:50.38]Can you hear her?
[246:51.42]Hold on.
[246:53.97]She's coughing, too.
[247:01.37]Yeah.
[247:02.07]She got it first.
[247:03.37]She has it bad.
[247:04.29]Mine's not that bad.
[247:05.13]I hope it doesn't progress.
[247:05.95]That would be terrible.
[247:08.59]But, I'll be honest with you here.
[247:11.72]This game is actually fucking fun.
[247:13.90]And I would recommend that you play this game if you think, you know, if you like doing this kind of thing.
[247:20.56]What a terrible, terrible review that I just gave.
[247:24.00]It's good if you like this, if you kind of like this kind of thing.
[247:27.71]Yeah, no shit.
[247:30.57]Etalyx is not sick.
[247:31.58]I don't know how me and Kim got this.
[247:32.80]I have no idea.
[247:38.58]It's really only been the last couple days though, so.
[247:44.20]But yeah, I'm gonna just get ready for Sekiro tomorrow.
[247:48.30]I'm gonna do the thing that I should do.
[247:51.88]And unfortunately we're gonna have like a four and a half hour stream.
[247:56.28]And I'm sorry I haven't been gone for four days for unrelated.
[247:59.10]A friend of mine came up and really the day coming back, I don't want to be like, see you later after like four hours.
[248:06.40]But we are going to go probably Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.
[248:11.11]Because I'm just going to, obviously, Sekiro is going to be on the mind.
[248:15.70]So with that, I'll see you tomorrow.
[248:18.26]If you don't want Sekiro to be spoiled, then by all means, I'll just see you again when that's over with.
[248:26.27]And later on in this coming week, Monster Rancher 4 and probably Monster Rancher 2, depending on how bad or good Monster Rancher 4 is, we'll be going back to it.
[248:38.14]So that's kind of the plan.
[248:40.44]Maybe go back to VR a little after that.
[248:43.28]Possibly.
[248:44.48]So...
[248:47.58]So, I will see you guys tomorrow for Sekiro.
[248:51.92]I'm fucking insanely excited for it.
[248:54.08]And again, sorry for the short stream tonight.
[248:58.44]But I'm going to rest up my voice.
[249:01.60]And like I said, of course the day coming back and having like, oh, let me pick a game where I read.
[249:06.72]Where I'm going to read a shitload of dialogue.
[249:11.11]What a dope.
[249:11.53]You know what I mean?
[249:17.77]Friday, yeah.
[249:18.51]Sekiro... Sekiro's technically out in like 30 or 40 minutes or something, but... We can wait till tomorrow.
[249:26.83]Thank you so much.
[249:27.29]Hope you enjoyed the time that we had here today.
[249:31.94]I'll see you for Sekiro tomorrow.
[249:34.22]Have a great one.
[249:37.46]Catch you guys later.
[249:39.90]And, with that being said, we are going to do the bits.
[249:45.20]Let me pull it up.
[250:05.92]Okay.
[250:09.52]So, we have earlier today... Let me get that out of the way.
[250:17.89]Okay.
[250:23.34]So, we had Sad Vega for the $2.50.
[250:25.36]Thank you, Sad Vega.
[250:25.90]Thank you.
[250:27.75]They say Sekiro tomorrow, as you know, it's going to be an amazing, horrible time for you.
[250:31.91]Sorry in advance for all the day one backseating you're going to get.
[250:36.13]I'm going to blitz that game tomorrow just to see all the shit you go through and laugh gleefully like a shit goblin as you suffer what I suffered through.
[250:44.36]I'll be rooting for you though, 100%.
[250:46.40]Also, your mother is coming up to visit.
[250:47.98]Don't you mean down or left?
[250:50.22]Because you're in Vegas, which I'm sure is southwest of Boston.
[250:56.33]That's true.
[250:57.41]Yes.
[250:58.93]But I always say up no matter what.
[251:00.89]Coming up somewhere, coming up somewhere, I always say up.
[251:04.01]Coming down left just doesn't sound right.
[251:08.33]But I'm looking forward to it.
[251:09.19]Hey, how do you know you're gonna blow through it?
[251:12.33]What if you get stuck?
[251:13.83]It might happen.
[251:16.67]Lapo VR is out now.
[251:18.59]The video is.
[251:20.95]Yeah, I gotta look into that too when that's coming out.
[251:25.39]Tutorial boss.
[251:26.31]Maybe I'll get stuck on it.
[251:27.33]I don't know.
[251:27.87]I hope I do.
[251:29.98]I hope I get like locked at an encounter for like 45 minutes to an hour or something.
[251:35.92]I miss that shit.
[251:37.26]I miss not knowing what to do and... It's a whole new experience.
[251:42.34]I cannot wait.
[251:46.62]Every death gift of one sub.
[251:48.40]I'm not gonna do that.
[251:52.53]Only an hour?
[251:55.14]Yeah.
[251:57.96]It's possible.
[251:59.70]But thank you.
[252:00.20]Thank you toshiro.TV for the five bucks.
[252:03.36]I'm super excited for you to play Sekiro, and I'm going to be playing the heck out of it too.
[252:06.64]But remember that there's not just dodging anymore.
[252:08.90]It's going to be weird to adjust, but the posture system is really well designed.
[252:13.26]Yeah, I've read some reviews about it.
[252:16.08]And, uh... Hold on.
[252:18.87]No, I thought there was one coming.
[252:20.17]We're good.
[252:21.56]Yeah, there's a whole system now on parries, right?
[252:26.86]Not like there was before.
[252:27.98]The parries are not the same throughout all the FromSoftware games.
[252:32.51]It's now, there's an indicator and there's three different moves that you can do to block or parry.
[252:38.49]It's not just like the, DOOM!
[252:40.23]Knock the thing up.
[252:40.95]You have to actually do a certain maneuver, right?
[252:45.16]Not just like hit left trigger, from my understanding.
[252:48.30]And you get like a telegraph on when it's gonna happen.
[252:51.50]So, I don't know.
[252:55.59]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[252:58.05]I'm so sorry.
[252:58.63]That was bad.
[253:00.25]I'm sure a lot of people are probably just so sick of hearing this tonight.
[253:03.23]Which is another reason why I'm like, it's probably for the best to stop.
[253:10.12]So, sorry.
[253:13.02]He's dying.
[253:15.40]No, I'm fine.
[253:18.26]But yeah, there's like two health bars, right?
[253:20.40]One of them's the posture system, one of them's the health bar.
[253:23.68]I'm sure it'll take a lot to get used to, but that's, you know, I'm looking forward to it.
[253:29.70]Thank you.
[253:31.36]Thank you, WildFox1, for the three bucks.
[253:33.38]Dear Jeremiah, on behalf of your recommendation, I have bought some metal straws, and I can say it was a good buy, so thanks for that.
[253:40.54]Yeah.
[253:43.27]Metal straws are awesome.
[253:45.77]The liquid stays cold going through.
[253:48.81]As for the question, I present each with each bit message.
[253:52.15]Why the fuck did you let that globalist mutant frog out into the wild?
[253:56.40]Do you want to watch the world burn?
[254:01.78]Referencing Seaman, if you don't know.
[254:06.03]I had to see the credits.
[254:06.87]That's my reasoning.
[254:09.57]Thank you though, WildFox.
[254:10.43]Thank you Jules for the 250.
[254:11.57]Have you thought about playing roleplay games like GTA RP?
[254:14.89]It's been getting a lot of attention recently.
[254:16.36]I think you'd be good at it.
[254:18.00]I think it would be a lot of fun.
[254:19.64]But... I um... I think I've... At least me personally, I don't like... to jump into random sessions with people that I don't know.
[254:33.17]Because it's hard for me to bounce off of strangers.
[254:38.24]If I get a few friends and we kind of all are in on the same jokes and the same material, it's really easy to create scenarios and create fun.
[254:47.43]But I don't really like to jump into just complete stranger scenarios where somebody says something.
[254:53.05]I mean, it would be fun, but it almost feels like, in a way, for me, when there's like a ton of people all kind of doing a bit at the same time,
[255:04.58]it's hard to like have your bit be a thing that you want to care about, you know what I mean?
[255:11.35]If you got like 10 people all making like a, uh, making something happen, realistically only like a couple people can like talk at once.
[255:19.06]And what it ends up being, it ends up being one or two people's stories that everybody else has to kind of find out how they're gonna fit into, involved inside of it, right?
[255:32.22]You could pretend to be a traveling salesman, pass through town, and only play for like a week.
[255:36.98]Yeah, and don't a lot of the RP servers have pretty staunch rules on what your character can do?
[255:45.29]Can't you- isn't it like a commitment?
[255:47.13]You really need to go in there and follow like a terms and... You need to take improv classes?
[255:57.00]No, I can... It's just when there's so many people all doing the same thing.
[256:02.98]Improv is improv, but when like 15 people are all doing improv at the same time, it kind of- it can just turn into noise.
[256:09.98]That's what I'm saying.
[256:14.10]That seems to happen with a lot of, um... Kind of- it's almost like this scenario where- and this is- this might sound, um... Like I'm talking shit or something, but I'm not.
[256:26.81]But back in the day, in YouTube,
[256:30.27]Everybody was making a video, right?
[256:32.99]So what would happen is if you got like five, six, seven people that you're all new, or you were kind of all going into a scenario with, all of you were recording at the same time.
[256:44.79]And all of you want to make the video and all of you want to make the joke.
[256:51.20]So what ends up happening is just like, it's almost incomprehensible.
[256:59.10]everybody's got their own intros, everybody's got their own, like, characters, everybody's got their own shit that they want to say, because they're making a video too, they're... want to be the spotlight, because their peop- their people are watching, you know what I'm saying?
[257:15.65]That's why it was always so much easier to, you know, get like a one or two people together and everybody knows kind of what we're gonna do for this bit, what we're gonna say, how fun are we gonna make it, what we're gonna do this time.
[257:28.52]And even if it was completely all off-the-cuff and improv, which a lot of it was, most of it was,
[257:35.58]30 main characters and no supporting cast.
[257:37.34]That's, yeah, that's what I mean.
[257:39.54]And that's not intended to, like, throw, like, shade at somebody.
[257:43.03]It's just, personally, I don't do well in an environment where everybody's all trying to make a joke at the same time.
[257:51.13]Because everybody has their camera pointed at them.
[258:02.54]You can hang out with only one or two people.
[258:04.02]Lots of streamers have just broken up into gangs.
[258:07.83]I mean, I don't know anything about it.
[258:10.13]All I know is that it's really, really popular right now.
[258:13.23]And anytime you jump into something really popular, it's kind of inevitable that you're gonna just get landed somewhere and... Alright, where's the camera pointing and where are we going, right?
[258:29.73]And that's not me talking specifically about GTA RP, that's just talking about the nature of kind of online playing or making a video or streaming with a bunch of other people that are all doing the same thing.
[258:56.79]But... It's not something that I... I think it would be a lot of fun.
[259:00.23]It's just... I'm not sure exactly even where to start with something like that.
[259:05.01]Because I really would just be like every... Like you said, people break off into like gangs and stuff and... I would just be the one dickhead.
[259:12.12]Walking around, like I said, trying to find the content to be a part of.
[259:16.50]Oh, we got like these like Five Guys are doing this.
[259:20.36]These like four or five people are doing this.
[259:21.94]And I'm just like, hey, I just joined.
[259:23.94]Hey...
[259:27.32]Alert!
[259:27.72]Alert!
[259:28.18]It's me!
[259:29.20]Alert!
[259:29.70]I'm here!
[259:30.38]Alert!
[259:30.84]Like, I don't even know where to start.
[259:41.37]But anyways.
[259:43.17]Hopefully that kind of answers the question of why I don't typically do RP-based stuff on stream or on video.
[259:52.40]Especially people that I don't know.
[259:53.78]That's the number one reason.
[259:56.48]Number one is with people that I don't know, right?
[260:00.83]But thank you for the $2.50.
[260:02.31]Thank you, Mad, for the $5.00.
[260:05.69]Hey Jerva, hope all is well.
[260:06.89]I'm heading to Boston on Saturday for college, so I might not be able to see some of your streams, but hey.
[260:12.60]Well, uh, welcome to Boston.
[260:20.46]Boston is a wonderful city.
[260:23.48]Enjoy it.
[260:23.86]Uh, going to college in Boston, is that... That's, uh... I don't know if it's a new thing or something you've been doing already, but good luck.
[260:38.29]And, uh... I don't know how far away you are, but... Hope you enjoy it.
[260:47.77]All the people I work with from there are pretty straightforward.
[260:51.43]Yeah, I mean... Boston is kind of one of those cities where it's just... Who are you?
[260:58.13]What do you want?
[260:59.25]And how do I get it to you as fast as possible?
[261:01.55]So you leave me alone.
[261:03.09]That's like a lot of, like, Boston.
[261:05.80]Who are you?
[261:06.70]Oh, my name's Jeremy.
[261:07.58]Okay, what do you want?
[261:08.96]Um, I want a sandwich.
[261:10.74]Alright, here.
[261:11.38]Here you go.
[261:11.78]It's done already.
[261:13.07]I didn't even order.
[261:13.75]Oh, you sure you didn't?
[261:15.51]And then they bring the order that I was gonna order.
[261:17.99]I... That's what I thought.
[261:20.09]Okay, thank you.
[261:20.93]Bye.
[261:29.08]Thank you, Tingy, for the $2.50.
[261:29.90]Jeremy, I don't think I could wear your shirts in public anymore.
[261:35.31]Why not?
[261:35.65]Over the weekend, I was out and someone saw me wearing my Night Sky shirt, and it must have angered them.
[261:41.57]He pointed at me and started yelling, Shpee, compact streamer, another weird thing.
[261:45.19]Oh.
[261:47.56]This is bullshit, is what he's saying.
[261:50.80]It's a great shirt.
[261:51.42]You should wear it.
[261:53.54]Thank you, though.
[261:55.14]I'm gonna, like, turn my mic fucking down.
[261:59.00]I hate being a coughing... It's alright.
[262:06.23]Spareth!
[262:06.73]Thank you, Spareth, for the 20 bucks earlier.
[262:08.75]Thank you.
[262:12.01]Jeremy the Jerm, the big Jerm, I have a request.
[262:14.83]My dearest friend Haley is having a birthday bash, and I need you.
[262:19.52]Okay.
[262:20.48]Okay.
[262:21.30]Her favorite hunk-o-man, I need you.
[262:27.03]her favorite hunko man to wish upon her the happiest birthday you've ever wished upon anyone upon reading this.
[262:35.01]I need you to go hard on this one for me, as hard as you can.
[262:38.33]Possibly get for $20.
[262:42.92]Well, alright.
[262:44.90]Somebody clip this.
[262:45.86]Don't get this first part, though.
[262:52.06]Haley.
[262:53.64]Hold on, no, no, not this part.
[262:54.88]Starting now.
[262:59.26]Haley, happy birthday.
[263:02.53]Just want to make that very clear.
[263:04.51]Hope you have a wonderful birthday, Haley.
[263:08.39]I don't know what your last name is, but I just know you're Haley.
[263:12.33]And I know that you're going to have a great fucking birthday.
[263:14.87]You know why?
[263:15.99]Because I just deemed it necessary.
[263:20.38]I want one.
[263:21.24]Somebody right there.
[263:23.32]Load up the crowd right now.
[263:25.00]There's at least 400 people at your party.
[263:27.08]Look at one, two, three, four, five.
[263:28.72]Stop blowing the horns.
[263:30.50]Put on the party hats.
[263:32.28]Get the ice cream out because it's your birthday.
[263:35.38]And everybody on Earth should be celebrating.
[263:37.32]I want this to be broadcast on fucking TV.
[263:40.94]And it will be.
[263:41.80]I'm going to spend the $645,000 it takes to put this and put it on every station.
[263:52.82]Happy birthday.
[263:54.84]And tune into MTV in a week when I pay Viacom.
[264:00.34]That's a lie.
[264:01.20]But happy birthday, Hayley.
[264:02.08]Hope you have a great day.
[264:09.60]Of course, you got friends.
[264:11.52]You got all kinds of friends that care about you.
[264:12.98]That's good.
[264:16.40]Looking out for you, you know?
[264:18.42]Happy birthday.
[264:21.41]Hey!
[264:23.22]Professor Breen, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[264:26.18]And that's it.
[264:28.53]Thank you so much, Professor Breen.
[264:31.69]No message.
[264:32.45]Just $10.
[264:33.77]Thank you.
[264:36.75]Thank you, Smelly Boy, for the $2.50.
[264:38.75]All these characters in the hierarchy are real.
[264:41.57]Jacques-Louis David was a world-renowned artist who operated during the Revolution.
[264:45.79]He made some of the most famous art pieces of the period, like this one.
[264:51.86]Ugh.
[264:53.80]This is Jacques-Louis David Bonaparte, Francis Legrand, Saint Bernard.
[264:59.87]Google Art.
[265:01.55]Okay.
[265:05.63]Wait, he made this?
[265:15.16]That's the guy who made the famous rearing Napoleon painting.
[265:19.74]That's cool.
[265:21.86]Didn't know that.
[265:22.36]It's a very educational game.
[265:25.55]Thank you, smelly boy.
[265:28.79]Thank you, Dorkcube, for the 250.
[265:30.15]You say 10 straight hours as if it's an amazing feat, but at this point, 9 or 10 hour streams are common for you when you gotta read bits for hours.
[265:39.60]Yeah, but that hasn't happened that very recently, no.
[265:44.48]All the streams recently since the 250 change, the end of the streams have not been that long.
[265:52.17]They've been maybe 30 to 40 minutes each.
[265:56.29]not anymore a nine to ten hour stream is really like has been recently a nine an eight to nine plus hour stream remember when he only streamed for like three or four hours yeah I do
[266:23.59]It was a few years ago.
[266:24.71]A couple years ago is really what it was.
[266:27.96]A four to five hour stream like two or three years ago was... That was a long stream for me.
[266:37.26]But also, I was so not used to that.
[266:39.19]That's another thing.
[266:41.19]Remember, I was making YouTube videos.
[266:43.45]I wasn't just broadcasting straight for four, five, six, seven, eight, nine hours.
[266:50.04]It took a long time, really, for me to really understand how to limit myself, energy-wise.
[266:58.04]Because I would just blow out for like an hour or two.
[267:02.03]And sometimes I still do that.
[267:04.15]But sometimes I'll just blow out for two or three straight hours and then just be exhausted.
[267:09.85]But I've learned sort of how to keep my energy levels up to a point where I'm not just blown out after three hours.
[267:29.55]Somebody said Vinny streams are like three hours max, but he also streams almost every day.
[267:35.03]Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of ways to do it.
[267:36.55]There's a lot of ways to... I know there are people... Aren't there people that will stream for like three, two or three hours and then they'll take a break and then come back in the nighttime and do another three or four hours?
[267:47.76]People do that.
[267:57.34]So, I mean, everybody is different.
[268:00.36]And I've found over the years that if, you know, I give myself a day or two off, a couple days off here or there, once a week, take like two or three days off, then I can usually sit here for more than five to six, maybe sometimes ten hours.
[268:17.22]But it's taken me a long time to figure out how to do that.
[268:21.30]And be comfortable doing it.
[268:25.02]Stream for five minutes every half hour.
[268:28.14]You would get unfollowed in a second.
[268:33.55]But thank you, Dork Cube, for the 250.
[268:34.99]You say 10 hours straight.
[268:36.61]That was Dork Cube.
[268:37.27]I don't even know if I said your name.
[268:45.95]But thank you.
[268:48.79]Yeah, CoreMonster.
[268:51.13]CoreMonster gave $100.
[268:51.71]$100.02.
[268:51.73]Thank you, CoreMonster.
[269:00.03]That's a shitload of money.
[269:01.18]We touched upon it already, but it's a fucking lot.
[269:03.24]Thank you.
[269:03.58]Yeah, nothing... I don't have any other issues, though.
[269:07.42]I don't have... You know, my head doesn't hurt.
[269:09.00]I don't have a stuffy nose.
[269:19.12]I just have this irritated throat and, like, an annoying cough that originates down here in my chest somewhere.
[269:26.74]So, here's the shitty part about that.
[269:30.44]If this doesn't go away in a few days, I'm probably gonna have to go to the doctor because, like, chest cough is, you don't, you want to take care of that.
[269:45.20]So, it's just, like, throat down until the, down here.
[269:51.50]But I'm fine.
[269:53.08]I just have a cough.
[269:54.10]It's not a problem.
[269:55.77]And if it becomes an issue, I'll take care of it.
[269:57.25]That's all there is to it.
[270:02.07]No shirt?
[270:02.57]Yeah, I just proved to everybody that I don't have a shirt on.
[270:05.35]That's all it took.
[270:09.24]I love how somebody just said that.
[270:11.28]No shirt.
[270:13.82]No.
[270:17.28]Nintendo tried to sue you recently.
[270:19.58]Who fucking made up that bullshit?
[270:22.95]Nintendo tried to sue me?
[270:28.05]What?
[270:28.97]Give me a source on that.
[270:30.07]Hey, Blue Comet, thanks for the $23, Blue Comet.
[270:36.41]Here are some bits, Jerma.
[270:37.17]Thanks for being so entertaining and funny.
[270:38.59]Jerma Hart.
[270:40.43]Thanks for paying me a shitload of money and watching the stream and being part of the community.
[270:44.41]Thank you.
[270:50.16]That means an absolute fuckton.
[270:51.34]Thank you so much.
[270:54.83]Dr. Pepper, thanks for the $10.
[270:56.17]Have some bits.
[270:56.77]You deserve it, girlfriend.
[270:58.83]Thank you, Dr. Pepper.
[271:00.77]For the $10.
[271:06.22]Really appreciate it.
[271:09.68]I'm honored that you think I deserve your money.
[271:13.56]Did I talk to Skrillex yet?
[271:14.91]No.
[271:16.55]No, I... I did not.
[271:20.22]Hey, Manboy, thanks for the 250.
[271:21.34]Hey, Jerma Nintendo tweeted out a video showcasing Labo VR.
[271:25.18]It's seven minutes long, so you should watch it on your own time.
[271:28.75]Too bad it probably won't be good for streaming.
[271:32.93]That's what everybody said about the other Labo streams, but that's not going to stop me from streaming it.
[271:40.33]I'm going to stream Labo VR.
[271:43.66]That is a promise.
[271:46.12]Why would I not do that?
[271:52.21]You have to put the switch on your head.
[271:54.70]Well, it's switch on head or pre-recorded.
[271:56.36]I can make that joke.
[271:59.84]Don't, like, clip that or anything.
[272:01.20]I want to be able to say that on that stream.
[272:05.54]But thank you, Manboy, for your $2.50 again.
[272:07.20]They forgot to link.
[272:09.63]I will definitely take a look at this.
[272:11.33]But thank you for the $5, Manboy.
[272:14.51]And then, Dorkcube, thanks for the $2.50.
[272:16.39]Get well soon, friend.
[272:17.19]I can't wait to see you play Sekiro tomorrow.
[272:19.25]And die to this game's version of Pinwheel.
[272:22.77]Nobody knows who that version is.
[272:24.11]Nobody knows anything about Pinwheel.
[272:28.80]I don't know, and you don't know.
[272:30.02]So even if I do die to Pinwheel tomorrow, you're not gonna know that for like another couple weeks, and then you'll forget.
[272:50.70]Prepared joke.
[272:51.54]And somebody just clipped it.
[272:52.50]I just told you not to.
[272:53.68]Oh my god, he did the thing.
[272:58.52]Ugh.
[273:00.70]Switch on head.
[273:03.96]Oh my goodness.
[273:06.24]Alright.
[273:08.06]Let's roll the credits!
[273:14.45]Let's see the subs and resubs tonight.
[273:18.64]A lot.
[273:20.10]A lot.
[273:20.60]A lot of people subbed and resubbed today.
[273:23.56]Been gone for a while.
[273:24.44]So, thank you guys.
[273:28.76]Jeremiah, the credits music.
[273:29.74]What?
[273:32.77]The music's on?
[273:36.21]What's your opinion of the French Revolution?
[273:39.43]It happened.
[273:43.11]Started watching your Stardew stream while working and it's cozy.
[273:47.79]Yeah.
[273:49.95]That's a cozy game.
[273:52.95]I can't wait to check out that multiplayer, right?
[274:01.37]What's that burger restaurant in Vegas called?
[274:03.05]They're going to be in Vegas tomorrow.
[274:03.99]I want to go there.
[274:04.51]Hash House A Go Go.
[274:07.84]It's at the link.
[274:10.22]You can put the stamp of it.
[274:11.96]You can wear a t-shirt that says, Jerma985 said this was the best restaurant in Las Vegas.
[274:20.10]The burger from... They do a stuffed burger.
[274:23.78]They do it as a specialty.
[274:25.14]From Hash House A Go-Go.
[274:26.68]In the link.
[274:28.27]Is probably the best fucking restaurant in Las Vegas.
[274:33.17]There it is.
[274:44.57]Sponsor.
[274:45.11]Nope.
[274:46.03]They just got the best burger in town.
[274:50.15]Did you really die to pinwheel?
[274:51.33]No.
[274:52.77]That is what they call a funny joke that the community has kept going.
[275:00.10]You know, to crawl under my skin, and say it, and I get really angry, and I say, I didn't do that.
[275:10.34]Never had the Gordon Ramsay burger?
[275:11.74]I've been to Gordon Ramsay's steak, which was incredible.
[275:20.75]That's the thing about Vegas.
[275:22.93]There are hundreds and hundreds of amazing restaurants.
[275:27.51]You kind of just have to pick one.
[275:33.48]This is the guy that beat Flam... Yeah.
[275:34.92]So, alright.
[275:35.44]So I beat Flamelurker first try.

[276:33.96]I've been not here for about a week, so... Are socks feet gloves or are gloves hand socks?
[276:42.58]Um, they're made out of, like, cotton.
[276:44.86]That's it.
[276:45.64]They can go anywhere.
[276:46.22]You can put cotton... You can put cotton, like, on your penis.
[276:51.06]And it's just cotton.
[276:53.81]I don't know why I said that, but that's pretty much where we're gonna end.
[276:59.75]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[277:01.13]See you soon.
[277:01.61]See you tomorrow.

[277:21.59]Anywho, I'll see you guys tomorrow for Sekiro.
[277:25.59]Uh, yeah, I ended early.

[278:43.17]Yeah, let's raid Kiwo.
[278:47.49]We raided Kryken a few days ago, and we raided Vinny a few days before that.
