[00:02.71]Let's open up a dark room.
[00:06.48]You would call this an idle game.
[00:09.24]It's a menu.
[00:10.39]It's literally just a menu.
[00:12.55]And it does have something interesting that happens in it.
[00:16.82]The game's pretty sick.
[00:18.76]But this is a chill zone now.
[00:22.95]So everybody shut up.
[00:26.79]We're just going to talk.
[00:27.51]We're going to chill.
[00:28.83]We're going to play a dark room.
[00:41.81]Fuck was that?
[00:55.53]It's not supposed to be that small.
[00:59.20]Awake, head throbbing, vision blurry, the voices say to survive.
[01:08.51]Okay, well, that's got to get bigger.
[01:13.08]Actually, it's probably better if I just capture it this way.
[01:23.08]Can I not capture it that way?
[01:30.30]It's kind of like blurry though, isn't it for you?
[01:32.24]If I do it like that?
[01:33.06]Hold on, let me try this.
[01:44.81]Is it fine?
[01:45.73]It's not blurry?
[01:48.59]Does it look good?
[01:53.58]Oh, okay.
[01:54.10]Alright, we're good then.
[01:54.93]Looks fine.
[01:57.41]Alright, so.
[01:58.41]This is a dark room.
[02:01.12]In a dark room, you wake up.
[02:03.24]We have one rusty knife.
[02:06.32]By the way, did you get yourself a nice little cocoa or something?
[02:09.43]Or a coffee?
[02:10.99]Eh.
[02:12.28]I haven't, and I want to.
[02:13.90]But I'm gonna wait like 25 more minutes.
[02:17.41]Alright, head throbbing, vision blurry, the voices say survive, the room is freezing.
[02:24.21]The fire is burning, the room is cold.
[02:29.96]Ahh.
[02:32.20]Oh.
[02:33.46]Too much, too much.
[02:36.65]Uh, a ragged stranger stumbles in.
[02:39.17]Through the door and collapses in the corner.
[02:44.93]The fire is roaring.
[02:49.12]So I got wood.
[02:50.20]I can go into the forest.
[02:52.95]And I can get wood from the forest.
[02:54.63]I have three wood right now.
[02:57.00]Hope she's okay.
[02:57.80]I have to keep the fire going.
[03:00.56]So this is how long it takes before I can get wood again.
[03:02.81]Stranger shivers and mumbles quietly.
[03:05.33]Her words are unintelligible.
[03:13.27]Stranger in the corner, stop shivering.
[03:14.61]Her breathing calms.
[03:15.93]This game gets crazy, by the way, in a chill way.
[03:22.22]Builder says she can make traps to catch creatures.
[03:26.02]Okay, so this is the builder.
[03:27.05]Builder resurrected.
[03:29.23]I got 16 wood.
[03:31.31]Can make a trap with 10 wood.
[03:33.37]So now we've got fur, meat, scales, teeth, cloth.
[03:37.08]more traps to catch more creatures builder says she can make traps to catch creatures so I I can now cart penwood gotta keep the fire going at all times she's woken up says she can build things says she's a friend
[03:59.91]I got to keep an eye on my stuff.
[04:01.13]Builder is plus five wood.
[04:04.38]These can go faster too.
[04:05.52]Eventually, you'll see.
[04:06.96]I don't want to spoil it.
[04:09.14]Alright, let's do... I got 15 wood, right?
[04:11.05]Yeah.
[04:12.85]More traps.
[04:19.30]More traps.
[04:24.29]This game's too smart for me?
[04:25.80]No, it is not, because I am... I am definitely... I can play this game, so definitely you can too.
[04:32.77]Alright, we got money and food.
[04:39.60]Now eventually we'll... I think we get to build more, like, huts, I think?
[04:45.23]Does it still say Monster Rancher?
[04:53.83]I need, um, I need more wood.
[04:59.63]It changed?
[04:59.99]Okay.
[05:02.98]Simple task brings solace.
[05:04.66]Gives purpose.
[05:05.68]Can't give up.
[05:10.08]Five traps.
[05:10.82]Alright.
[05:11.80]Ooh.
[05:14.17]Here we go.
[05:14.49]Okay.
[05:14.65]A hut.
[05:15.13]80 wood.
[05:17.15]Builder says there are more wanderers.
[05:18.89]Says they'll work too.
[05:23.42]Alright, I'm done with traps for now.
[05:27.77]I need 80 wood.
[05:31.07]Sound effects are great.
[05:33.99]Yeah, there's something really nice about hearing it every time you click it.
[05:41.02]Okay.
[05:43.06]Hut.
[05:45.03]Builder puts up a hut out in the forest.
[05:46.65]Says word will get around.
[05:48.87]Fire is roaring.
[05:51.39]Alright, here's the hut.
[05:53.26]Alright, my population is zero right now out of four.
[05:55.60]There are no visuals in this game.
[05:59.62]No, it's only menus.
[06:02.77]Hold on.
[06:05.21]I don't think that's accurate.
[06:12.42]Builder says villagers could help hunt given the means.
[06:18.46]What's our population?
[06:19.56]It's still zero.
[06:22.87]Um, a lodge is 10 for 100 wood.
[06:26.04]Alright, I don't have that yet.
[06:32.07]Maybe more traps.
[06:36.76]Looks like a game you could play on a calculator.
[06:39.16]It probably would run on a calculator.
[06:43.91]Looks like a fun game, but not a good streaming game.
[06:47.35]That's fine.
[06:47.81]I don't, if people aren't anyway, that's fine.
[06:51.06]I want to play it though, and that's what we're doing.
[06:56.20]Alright, got a lodge.
[06:57.64]Hunting lodge stands in the forest a ways out of town.
[07:00.13]The fire is roaring.
[07:07.70]Oh, I got a family now.
[07:08.62]A weathered family takes up in one of the huts.
[07:11.97]Can't help but reflect on humble beginnings.
[07:13.77]She smiles.
[07:14.95]Restless sleep looking upon the village brings peace.
[07:18.40]Okay.
[07:19.72]There are two people I could make...
[07:22.56]one gatherer for wood and then one gatherer for bird meat.
[07:36.18]I've got plenty.
[07:36.74]Okay, now let's do... No, I want another hut.
[07:47.73]When are you going to stop mewing?
[07:50.51]Um, I didn't even know if that was until Ludwig told me what it was while he was teaching me how to do it.
[08:00.80]Okay, there's a trade point.
[08:01.82]Uh, I want a hut.
[08:03.32]More population.
[08:10.75]Yeah, Ludwig, uh, was like, hey, do this.
[08:14.27]I was like, huh?
[08:14.95]And he goes, no, no, no, do this.
[08:15.81]And he taught me all the ways to do it.
[08:16.95]You got to put your tongue there and you got to push it up and... You have to... He taught me how to Mew.
[08:26.56]He taught me...
[08:34.84]Ugh... Whatever!
[08:37.70]He taught me how to... You put like... Words can't even come out of my mouth now.
[08:42.69]You guys have fucked with me too much.
[08:48.56]It's a facial expression and he showed me how to do it.
[08:57.51]Oh, that hurt my stomach.
[08:58.85]Okay.
[09:08.60]100 wood, 3... Okay, I need 100 fur.
[09:11.07]Do I have any more villagers?
[09:13.57]I do, alright.
[09:24.07]I think I'm going to do another hut.
[09:26.09]Is that stupid, do you think?
[09:26.85]There's chewing gum for it?
[09:31.56]You need to show us right now.
[09:32.86]I'm not... No, I'm not mewing on camera.
[09:41.65]Yeah, see how it's an idle game.
[09:43.29]We have people that are just gathering wood now.
[09:48.22]And I can do it myself.
[09:51.56]Another family came in.
[09:54.09]Pure the meat or it will spoil.
[09:55.83]Builder says she can help repair.
[09:58.49]Oh, we need like a fridge.
[10:00.90]Smokehouse is okay.
[10:03.46]I'm doing another hut.
[10:10.79]Some of the traps have been torn apart.
[10:12.49]Large prints lead away into the forest.
[10:16.74]Uh, track them.
[10:18.76]Not far from the village lies a large beast.
[10:20.86]It's fur matted with blood.
[10:23.30]It puts up little resistance before the knife.
[10:26.33]Oh, shit, I just got meat.
[10:27.23]A ton of meat.
[10:34.50]Alright, I need a... We need a smokehouse.
[10:36.16]I gotta prioritize this.
[10:43.14]Is there a jump scare?
[10:44.34]No.
[10:45.54]This is just something I've always wanted to play and just stream and just to talk about random stuff while I play it.
[10:51.03]There's no jump scare.
[10:53.83]It's just like a fun, busy work game.
[10:57.87]How much did you play already?
[10:58.75]I just started it right when I just went over to it.
[11:04.10]Used to love this game.
[11:04.80]I completely forgot about it.
[11:05.86]That's what I'm saying, right?
[11:06.70]I didn't even know it came to Steam.
[11:09.59]When I heard there was a Steam version, I was like, wait, what?
[11:12.89]That's what piqued my interest in the first place to stream it.
[11:16.53]I need more people to move in.
[11:22.78]Alright.
[11:23.00]I need way more wood.
[11:24.20]Let's get some of those people on it.
[11:32.86]How come there's so many labubus?
[11:35.80]Because it's currently in right now.
[11:42.20]I'm going to wait.
[11:42.98]No, I'll do the trading post.
[11:46.08]Not enough to build.
[11:46.73]What do I need?
[11:47.15]300 wood.
[11:55.28]Simple task helps calm the nerves.
[11:57.72]The voices speak of a compass.
[12:02.02]I think there is another thing I can do, if I remember.
[12:09.49]Alright, we're almost there.
[12:15.48]Ten more wood and we're good.
[12:19.99]Alright, I got a trading post.
[12:21.05]Now the nomads have a place to set up shop.
[12:23.43]They might stick around a while.
[12:26.16]Builder says leather could be useful.
[12:27.60]Says the villagers could make it.
[12:30.94]Okay, because now you can turn... Yeah, so scales... Okay, compasses 400 fur.
[12:38.85]Scales is OK, so I can trade 30.
[12:42.83]Fur for scales.
[12:44.28]I can trade teeth for fur.
[12:51.51]OK.
[12:51.59]You gonna play abiotic factor?
[12:53.89]Um?
[12:56.49]It looks cool.
[12:57.35]I I don't know.
[13:01.60]At least in the last couple of years, I feel like I've been less into the build and craft and have a house and make food and shelter and build shelter.
[13:10.79]It does look cool, though.
[13:19.57]How many people do I have?
[13:20.79]I need another hut.
[13:25.86]I got a ton of meat.
[13:34.08]Vinny VA's in that game.
[13:35.52]Does he really?
[13:43.11]I want another hut.
[13:46.56]Yes, he does.
[13:47.26]Really?
[13:49.40]That's fucking cool.
[13:56.51]Alright, how am I doing on...
[14:00.00]I need 400 fur.
[14:02.06]We need more people to do trapping and stuff.
[14:07.77]That's why you want more population because then you can spread people out.
[14:13.10]Didn't realize it was even him until he mentioned it on stream.
[14:18.55]I think he's a talented guy.
[14:21.75]I have so much meat.
[14:23.24]I need to make that smokehouse.
[14:26.98]400 wood.
[14:27.74]Alright, let's put everybody on wood temporarily.
[14:41.24]What am I getting?
[14:41.80]Like 10 to 20?
[14:42.77]Or I'm getting 15 every... 3?
[14:45.23]Is it 15 per 5?
[14:47.91]Is there a world out there beyond the village?
[14:50.56]Looking past the edge of the forest, figures dance in the shadows.
[14:56.51]Alright, I got more people.
[15:00.35]What happened to Monster Rancher?
[15:01.44]I completed my journey.
[15:04.30]I have my three monsters for the tournament.
[15:06.34]They are ready.
[15:08.00]They are locked in and oh my goodness are they strong as hell.
[15:19.72]Alright, how much is the... The voices speak of a forest.
[15:27.29]I think there is a little more to this game than I remember.
[15:31.65]I'm going to prioritize the food because I have a lot of meat.
[15:34.50]400 wood and 50 meat.
[15:42.09]Alright, I got a smokehouse.
[15:42.95]Builder finishes the smokehouse.
[15:44.00]Her reluctance shows.
[15:48.81]Now we won't lose any meat.
[15:59.83]Stranger arrives in the night.
[16:01.91]Is that bad?
[16:03.85]Okay, here we go.
[16:04.48]We can make a charcuterie.
[16:07.58]So this makes... So it's plus five meat.
[16:11.44]So you lose five meat, lose five wood, and gain one cured meat for five seconds.
[16:18.51]So we need a ton of people on wood.
[16:23.12]So we'll do this until we get more cured meat.
[16:33.87]Uh, I'm going for population.
[16:37.84]Another hut, 310 wood.
[16:43.91]When is the tournament?
[16:44.55]It's going to be Wednesday.
[16:45.65]It was originally going to be Monday, but I don't think people just weren't ready.
[17:01.83]I am using up the wood though.
[17:04.47]Alright, less of this, less of this.
[17:06.44]I'm using up too much meat.
[17:07.72]Too much wood, too much wood.
[17:08.70]Alright, I've got 50 cured meat now.
[17:10.56]Everybody cart wood.
[17:16.01]At least it's not time constraint like House Flipper.
[17:19.59]Well, this is only 6 people.
[17:21.62]So, it's way easier to get 6 people than 24.
[17:26.93]I can't believe that we actually got 24 people.
[17:34.15]Okay, you know that game, um, where it's a series of lights and there's three or four lights lit up and you have to turn off all the lights?
[17:44.42]It's a board of, it's a, you know, um, like, it's like five rows of five or three rows of three.
[17:51.79]And you press that light and it turns that light off and then turns on two others around it and it's a puzzle.
[18:01.87]Trying to get, oh, some of the traps have been torn apart.
[18:05.58]Okay, let's go track them.
[18:08.98]You always do this because I think it's pretty rare that you get hurt and you get a ton of meat and a bunch of fur.
[18:17.95]But that's what it felt like.
[18:19.73]Anytime getting more than 20 people that all have their own schedules, right?
[18:23.60]Like we're talking about people that are streamers and YouTubers.
[18:27.03]People have commitments, they have things they're doing.
[18:29.11]I'm doing this, I'm doing that.
[18:30.86]So you would get confirmation from like eight people, and then two other people were like, that's not going to work.
[18:37.89]And then you go, okay, well, what about this day?
[18:39.57]Those nine people now can do it, and then four other people can't.
[18:44.24]It really did feel like playing that game until you could get that one day where all the lights were off.
[18:54.35]Okay.
[18:54.99]I want this compass.
[18:56.61]I got so much wood now.
[19:00.18]Alright.
[19:00.50]A tannery is... I need a little bit more wood.
[19:02.86]Damn.
[19:05.14]That was dumb, but I like having population.
[19:11.81]Alright.
[19:11.99]I got a modest village now.
[19:16.22]I'm just going to get to a thousand wood.
[19:18.12]Alright.
[19:20.70]Thanks for playing.
[19:21.18]This is one of my favorite games.
[19:23.43]this was one of my favorite browser games ever it just I don't know something about it it's just chill but this is the steam version you can play it on steam right now and there is a sequel to this game not to spoil it but there is a sequel called the ensign and it I might play that too because that one's really fun too
[19:52.10]It's a light room.
[19:54.84]Alright, 400 fur, 20 skin.
[19:57.13]Alright, I can do the compass.
[19:58.37]Maybe I shouldn't do it yet.
[20:06.02]I keep spending all my stuff.
[20:09.39]Okay, I'm going to do huts two more times and I'm done.
[20:12.71]I won't do hut again.
[20:26.42]Why won't Twitch notify me even though I follow you?
[20:28.39]I feel like that's always been a problem.
[20:32.37]I remember back during the YouTube days where people would not get a video into their sub box.
[20:45.39]Scratching noises can be heard from the storeroom.
[20:47.69]Something is in there.
[20:49.55]Investigate.
[20:50.93]Some wood is missing.
[20:51.92]The ground is littered with scraps of cloth.
[20:56.09]Okay, well, whatever.
[21:06.69]Okay.
[21:08.11]One more hut.
[21:10.13]After this.
[21:15.52]Shit.
[21:15.94]Okay.
[21:16.30]Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[21:20.53]Everybody's on wood duty.
[21:21.47]It's fine.
[21:26.43]I do got a lot of fur.
[21:32.28]No, we don't need more fur right now.
[21:33.80]I need to turn the fur into... The thirst to explore grows.
[21:36.92]The compass beckons.
[21:38.41]The worry in her eyes grows.
[21:42.73]I don't want a compass yet.
[21:43.59]I want one more thing of population.
[21:49.76]Should I get the compass now?
[21:53.16]What do you guys think?
[21:56.79]Yeah.
[22:00.39]It's almost all the fur I have, but that's fine.
[22:04.22]It's like cookie clicker.
[22:04.96]We'll get a ton more later.
[22:09.69]What am I... I'm a fucking idiot.
[22:11.51]I just... I had to do it.
[22:20.40]It's looked so cheap.
[22:21.57]I had to do it.
[22:29.05]Alright, let's get to 400.
[22:29.91]I'll get the compass.
[22:30.71]16 traps contained scraps of fur.
[22:43.49]Oh, it tells you what everything had.
[22:46.25]You do get a lot for doing that though.
[22:48.93]Alright, here we go.
[22:49.35]Let's get the compass.
[22:52.45]This is all the fur and scales and teeth.
[22:54.92]I have enough teeth, right?
[22:57.00]Alright, I have the compass.
[22:59.56]A dusty path.
[23:02.89]Embark.
[23:05.05]Bag, 0 out of 100.
[23:06.23]Flask, 10 water.
[23:07.92]Rags, 25 HP.
[23:09.48]I think I can die.
[23:13.20]Cured meat.
[23:18.05]Okay, I'm going to take 4 cured meat.
[23:26.02]I don't know.
[23:26.52]Maybe I shouldn't.
[23:29.43]Can't do it yet anyways.
[23:33.74]The compass spins.
[23:34.66]Have to venture out.
[23:35.96]She says not to.
[23:37.60]She warns of death.
[23:39.33]The villagers.
[23:39.93]The fatigue in their eyes.
[23:41.67]Backbreaking labor.
[23:42.71]No rest for the villagers.
[23:44.71]Need to venture farther.
[23:45.68]The food from the smokehouse will help.
[23:53.47]I'm doing it.
[23:55.33]I'll take five food.
[24:00.79]Is this guy playing some busted game again?
[24:04.35]This game is designed very well.
[24:05.75]It's not broken.
[24:06.50]It's fine.
[24:12.42]Okay, I'm going.
[24:13.27]Embark.
[24:15.03]Oh, that's right.
[24:15.87]It is like an old roguelike.
[24:18.23]Do you remember these back when fucking computers talked with beeping noises at you?
[24:23.72]Okay.
[24:24.61]I have five food and ten water.
[24:30.37]I'm in the middle here.
[24:31.45]I'm going to go to the left.
[24:33.75]An old house.
[24:34.47]An old house remains here.
[24:35.52]Once white.
[24:36.86]Siding yellowed and peeling.
[24:38.14]The door hangs open.
[24:39.00]Water replenished.
[24:39.96]I'm going to go inside.
[24:41.59]Okay.
[24:43.11]A man charges down the... A man charges... A rusty blade in his hand.
[24:47.86]I only have a fist?
[24:48.72]I thought I had a knife.
[24:54.63]Uh-oh.
[25:01.08]Okay, well that's why I take the food.
[25:09.19]Okay.
[25:10.01]Got it.
[25:11.13]Loot.
[25:12.73]He had cured meat, leather, and cloth.
[25:17.32]Give me the leather.
[25:18.88]Holy shit, he's got ten leather?
[25:20.30]I can't take any more.
[25:24.75]Okay.
[25:26.69]Continue.
[25:29.76]I'm going back.
[25:31.89]Alright, I brought leather back.
[25:35.56]Cool.
[25:36.10]Alright, so I forgot there was a whole other part of the game.
[25:38.08]So it's not just a menu game.
[25:41.21]I gotta pee again.
[25:42.55]I'm coming up at a break.
[25:44.81]I've had to pee pretty much on the hour every hour, which is weird.
[25:49.68]Alright, how's everybody doing?
[25:50.48]We got people getting stuff.
[25:52.60]Look at all this wood I got.
[25:53.54]Okay, let's go.
[25:54.22]What am I making?
[25:56.41]Hannery.
[25:59.17]Now I can make
[26:03.15]Leather, right?
[26:05.55]Leather for the finer things must push them.
[26:08.13]Make them work through eternal night.
[26:10.94]They are slaves.
[26:13.94]Oh god.
[26:27.36]We're good.
[26:30.67]Okay, now it's fur.
[26:33.21]Ten fur goes into two leather.
[26:38.00]Let's spread people out now.
[26:39.20]We need... Okay, a ton of hunters.
[26:46.65]No gatherer populations to allocate this role.
[26:49.72]Okay.
[26:52.94]So we'll keep that up for now.
[27:00.08]What do I need?
[27:04.15]I think I'm okay for now.
[27:07.39]I think I'm going to do another expedition.
[27:12.76]Among the 10k viewers, one of them has to be a murderer.
[27:18.82]I don't think so, considering... What is the percentage to that?
[27:24.61]What's the percentage?
[27:27.25]What is one person out of 10,000?
[27:34.42]scale that up to like eight or nine billion right if that person's correct then that means how many murderers are on the entire world population it's one in ten thousand I know but what what is one in ten thousand scaled up to ten billion people it's nine million are there nine million murderers in the world
[28:03.06]They're actually, I don't know, maybe?
[28:04.56]I don't know.
[28:08.32]No.
[28:09.37]Do you think there's 10 million murderers?
[28:12.19]I don't, I don't know.
[28:12.81]I can't, I don't, maybe?
[28:14.79]Alright, I gotta pee.
[28:20.84]Uh, let me save the game.
[28:22.88]Oh, no, it saves it automatically.
[28:25.82]Okay.
[28:27.18]Uh, I'm gonna let them just... No, I wanna see everything.
[28:31.56]Alright, I'll be back.
[28:32.27]I gotta pee.
[28:33.04]I'm gonna get a drink and I'll be back in a few minutes.
[28:35.46]We'll keep going.
[31:44.83]I'm back, but these crunches are going to be crazy.
[31:54.72]It's going to be insane.
[31:55.62]I can't do anything about it.
[31:56.94]I can just mute.
[31:58.12]I'll mute for like a minute.
[32:11.74]Okay.
[32:12.74]I'm back.
[32:13.08]Hello.
[32:15.75]Okay.
[32:17.17]Um, so.
[32:18.65]I got a thousand meat.
[32:20.43]You're going to hear me crunch.
[32:21.19]I'm going to crunch, by the way, a lot.
[32:23.25]I apologize.
[32:25.82]Um.
[32:27.32]If you want to lower your volume a little bit, it's probably going to be louder than anything else you'll hear today.
[32:37.31]Okay.
[32:41.03]What do I want to do next?
[32:41.83]I want to...
[32:55.30]I have to mute.
[32:56.20]It is actually insane.
[33:06.60]What is this now?
[33:08.26]What is this?
[33:10.20]Skeletor, she's been all over, willing to talk about it for a price.
[33:13.61]200 fur?
[33:16.21]Yeah, shove it up your ass.
[33:18.76]Wait.
[33:20.30]Learn a skill?
[33:25.17]I might buy the map.
[33:28.11]I don't even have... Oh.
[33:31.70]Well, shit.
[33:35.21]What do I have?
[33:35.69]I have, like, my bare feet, right?
[33:37.97]I can, like, kick?
[33:45.04]Alright.
[33:45.42]I have seven water.
[33:48.69]What is a V and I?
[33:49.83]Okay, let's go to I. Iron Mine.
[33:55.17]An old iron mine sits here, tools abandoned and left to rust.
[33:59.50]Bleached bones are strewn about the entrance, many deeply- Okay, go inside.
[34:02.84]I don't have a torch, shit.
[34:09.15]A strange bird speeds across the plains.
[34:11.96]Ready?
[34:14.40]Alright, it's my bare fists.
[34:28.45]Oh my God, it's killing me.
[34:34.46]OK, we're good.
[34:35.54]What you got?
[34:37.02]Cured meat and scales like the scales.
[34:42.71]I have to go back.
[34:44.26]Think I can starve.
[34:46.64]Yeah, we're good.
[34:50.51]I always knew you'd end up punching birds in the forest.
[35:00.02]Can you make a torch?
[35:03.75]This is... I can't eat these while I stream.
[35:06.47]I need to go back to my other snack.
[35:10.60]Died out there?
[35:12.82]Saw her face before collapsing.
[35:14.10]A glowing locket around her neck.
[35:16.39]Brought back to life by her.
[35:17.59]How?
[35:17.99]What?
[35:22.14]Did I die?
[35:43.41]Oh shit, let's make this.
[35:56.38]I have so much meat.
[35:58.60]I have 1500 meat?
[36:12.04]Alright, everybody get wood.
[36:18.78]We have 30 people getting wood.
[36:21.06]Oh my god!
[36:21.68]What?
[36:21.96]No!
[36:22.72]We're a population of... We're a community.
[36:25.61]What?
[36:38.88]Okay.
[36:39.82]Fire's brewing.
[36:42.74]Have at least one tanner and a charcuterie at least.
[36:46.38]I know.
[36:46.63]It's true.
[36:57.71]I'm running out of fur, though.
[37:00.76]Alright, I go all in.
[37:02.04]I'm stupid.
[37:03.77]We need... How much is it?
[37:05.01]It's five fur to make one leather, so we need five people making five fur, one person doing one leather.
[37:12.23]So this is now sustainable.
[37:20.15]Dude, if there was a pretzel eating contest, I would win it.
[37:23.16]It doesn't matter how big the next guy is.
[37:25.64]If there was a hard, crunchy pretzel eating contest, I would win it.
[37:35.89]A tuna and pretzel contest?
[37:37.58]Oh man, that sounds damn good right now.
[37:40.68]Oh, what an awesome snack.
[37:46.01]What an amazing idea that is.
[37:50.23]Who said that?
[37:52.37]They get banned protection for a week.
[37:56.91]Alright, I have a workshop now.
[37:58.63]I think this is where you can make items to bring out so you don't get killed.
[38:02.92]Okay, I can make a bone spear.
[38:05.08]Oh yeah, I definitely want a water skin.
[38:09.21]More water.
[38:11.27]A rucksack?
[38:11.93]We need more leather.
[38:13.43]Leather armor?
[38:14.45]Okay.
[38:16.59]A torch!
[38:20.50]Oh, fuck, I used everything.
[38:21.76]Oops.
[38:28.63]You get a presidential pardon for one week.
[38:33.08]Use it wisely.
[38:35.22]Torches to light the caves.
[38:36.52]Spears to take lives.
[38:41.21]Alright, I think I'm ready to do... Wait, I want... I want at least a better weapon, so we need wood and teeth.
[38:48.83]I can make one of these.
[38:50.01]Alright, I have a spear now.
[38:53.22]I don't have enough leather for this.
[38:54.36]I do.
[38:55.62]Okay.
[38:55.78]I can carry more items.
[38:59.11]And I think I want to bring leather armor out.
[39:03.37]So I need 200 more leather.
[39:04.71]Let's get people on leather duty.
[39:14.69]That's good.
[39:17.87]This is sustainable.
[39:18.94]I don't want to use all this wood though, but it's fine.
[39:31.90]How much wood am I getting?
[39:33.85]Seven wood?
[39:35.39]It's fine.
[39:38.73]Did you finish White Knuckle?
[39:41.19]Uh, no.
[39:42.66]I got to the end of Act 2?
[39:44.96]Well, no, I got through like a third of Act 3.
[39:48.91]And watched Ster do a run, realized how crazy the rest of the game was, and then said, this is a good game for me to watch.
[40:03.49]Okay, 127.
[40:04.61]I can just buy it at the trade post, okay?
[40:08.21]It's 20 fur.
[40:12.72]How much teeth do I have?
[40:15.40]Scales.
[40:16.28]Do I have a lot of scales?
[40:17.04]I kind of do have a lot of... That's fine.
[40:20.69]Okay.
[40:23.05]Alright, now I got 300 weight.
[40:25.87]I can take a bone spear.
[40:27.39]I can take a torch.
[40:29.35]And I'll take some meat.
[40:32.92]And when I come back, we'll have enough leather.
[40:34.38]I'm going to embark.
[40:38.12]Alright, let's go into that mine.
[40:41.36]Another bird.
[40:47.67]So you can use your fists and your spear.
[40:54.66]I'll take the scales.
[41:00.16]Alright, go inside with the torch.
[41:03.51]Oh, fuck.
[41:06.80]What is it?
[41:07.08]A bat?
[41:10.66]A large creature.
[41:14.15]He's kicking the shit out of me.
[41:19.43]Oh, fuck.
[41:19.93]Okay.
[41:21.35]Alright.
[41:21.90]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[41:26.74]It's got a bunch of teeth.
[41:27.50]I'll take it.
[41:32.29]Uh, should I take another torch?
[41:38.16]I'll take the cloth.
[41:41.56]The beast is dead.
[41:42.36]The mine is now safe.
[41:43.72]A hard night's work complete.
[41:47.48]Oh.
[41:54.49]Fuck, I can't take it all.
[41:56.65]Okay, I need to drop some stuff.
[42:00.22]It's getting dark.
[42:01.26]Oh my god.
[42:02.62]Drop the scales.
[42:05.73]Uh, drop the, uh, teeth.
[42:12.46]Drop the teeth.
[42:16.10]And go.
[42:17.16]I'm out.
[42:17.54]I'm done.
[42:20.27]Alright.
[42:22.81]I told you there wasn't any jump scares, but I, I don't know.
[42:27.61]I got a bunch of, I got 23 iron though.
[42:29.12]That's good.
[42:34.91]So now I can make iron.
[42:36.93]30 fur and 5 scales.
[42:42.84]Cool.
[42:45.72]Ooh, now I can make iron armor.
[42:50.63]Let's take an assessment here.
[42:54.09]Roads for safety.
[42:55.89]Blood for iron.
[42:57.39]Their power grows as their fire dies.
[43:02.10]Okay, iron miner.
[43:05.64]Oh, I have so much meat.
[43:08.26]Alright, this is where it gets wild.
[43:09.54]Alright.
[43:11.42]I have a ton of meat.
[43:16.85]I need more population.
[43:21.92]So this is seven cured meat, seven iron, but this is now sustainable.
[43:28.64]I need more people getting meat.
[43:31.34]I need more population.
[43:32.62]Her sad eyes look upon the village.
[43:34.92]She weeps.
[43:35.53]The thirst to conquer grows.
[43:41.65]The build is going to leave.
[43:42.51]She's really sad.
[43:43.26]I need more population.
[43:48.12]We need way more wood.
[43:49.70]Not enough wood.
[43:54.45]No, please.
[43:56.15]Don't.
[43:58.13]No, no, no!
[43:59.72]I'm sorry.
[44:08.20]Was that as funny as I hoped it was?
[44:14.33]What did my... Oh, the meat.
[44:21.22]I thought he said kinda.
[44:28.63]Alright, what's using all the wood?
[44:30.31]This is using too much wood.
[44:31.41]I need way more wood.
[44:40.32]How do I only have 78 wood?
[44:52.16]Imagine doing that during stand-up.
[44:56.52]That would be, what a bad, that's an open mic night type of booed joke.
[45:05.49]I have to sneeze?
[45:06.31]I need to make this really funny, don't I?
[45:09.64]And it's just, what a flat joke that is.
[45:14.20]Okay, I got 200 iron.
[45:19.23]I'm gonna go with the armor.
[45:22.45]How many skills do I got?
[45:23.38]Okay.
[45:24.90]Leather armor.
[45:31.08]Iron sword.
[45:38.67]Let's go.
[45:41.93]And then a cask?
[45:47.08]This will hold more water, right?
[45:50.38]Shit, I need... I need more leather.
[45:58.01]I need more leather!
[45:58.91]More!
[46:03.45]Do I have no fur?
[46:04.51]I got no fur!
[46:09.84]I need more population.
[46:11.38]Immediately.
[46:20.51]We're just gonna focus on population for a minute.
[46:28.66]Everybody get wood.
[46:36.30]Have you ever done something similar to stand-up?
[46:40.45]I feel like anything that I would ever do for stand-up, I've already just done it here.
[46:46.88]I've written down hundreds of jokes and hundreds of references and little non sequiturs that I just say here.
[46:57.05]You guys have been getting that routine for 15 years.
[47:07.61]Scratching noise can be heard from the storeroom.
[47:09.21]Get in there.
[47:12.85]Stop taking the wood.
[47:15.22]You're making me angry.
[47:19.54]Is that your creative process?
[47:20.70]You write stuff down and use it here?
[47:24.67]Not just here.
[47:25.35]I have a... I have like dozens and dozens of ideas written down that no one's ever heard of or seen.
[47:37.42]It's crazy.
[47:38.09]There are things that have happened behind the scenes that you guys will just probably never know.
[47:42.03]And I'm talking crazy shit that just didn't happen.
[47:46.55]And I almost like... I think I want to like ask.
[47:49.62]Because some of this stuff is out-fucking-rageous.
[47:53.28]That... I want to ask some people if I could talk about some of them.
[47:58.64]Because there's a few in particular that are just so out... completely outrageous.
[48:03.51]That I almost like need to talk about them one day.
[48:09.37]Like the Battle Act stream?
[48:10.95]No, no, that just didn't happen, right?
[48:12.83]Because of a few different reasons, but... I'm talking about stuff that you guys have never even heard about.
[48:17.92]That had a ton of stuff happen that was potentially going to happen behind the scenes.
[48:24.17]And I'm talking about... The craziest thing that you could ever think of...
[48:30.13]that I could do on a stream or what I would do like as a part of a collaboration or something or an event or something it's not it's you you're not even close of things that have potentially happened or maybe would have happened um if I got the go ahead to talk about it you guys wouldn't believe half the
[48:56.96]And I'm not even talking about negative either.
[48:58.46]It's not like, oh my god, something so horrible or something bad happened.
[49:02.16]I'm just saying stuff that just didn't make it to the finish line or stuff that I was asked if I wanted to do that I just said no or no, it didn't really work out or stuff falls through, the financing doesn't work or the timing doesn't work.
[49:23.60]But some of the stuff has been...
[49:26.88]Very weird.
[49:39.30]Okay, I got plenty of wood now.
[49:42.30]And we're going to immediately use it.
[49:47.05]Let me do that one more time.
[49:53.20]Why would you do that if we can't know?
[49:55.52]No, you definitely will be.
[49:56.58]A pack of snarling beasts pours out of the trees.
[49:59.87]The fight is short and bloody.
[50:01.13]The beasts are repelled.
[50:02.03]The villagers retreat to mourn the dead.
[50:03.85]20 people died?
[50:06.03]What do you mean 20 people died?
[50:11.70]We need more people.
[50:16.60]I think I will be able to talk about at least one of them.
[50:20.24]You guys are going to laugh your ass off because I laughed my ass off
[50:27.83]And I think of like the what could have been scenario in some of these things.
[50:32.52]I don't know what would have happened if I did this.
[50:38.08]How would this have been taken?
[50:39.55]How would this have possibly been taken?
[50:44.15]And you'll know maybe one day.
[50:45.43]I'll tell you.
[50:48.42]Look, my 40th birthday is coming up.
[50:50.40]Who gives a shit?
[50:52.67]You know what I mean?
[50:53.21]It's not like I'm going to do it.
[51:01.31]I can't believe 20 people died.
[51:06.92]He's teasing.
[51:09.16]I don't mean to.
[51:09.94]It's just... A lot of stuff happens behind the scenes that, like, you just don't ever know.
[51:17.69]Some really, really crazy, good, funny.
[51:23.80]Some head-scratching stuff where you're just like, what the fuck am I... Why would I do that?
[51:33.20]But now you can't sell those ideas.
[51:34.63]Well, that's another thing too.
[51:36.63]The reason why I even started talking about this is somebody said, is that your creative process?
[51:41.28]And I gave you like kind of an annoying tone.
[51:43.46]That's not even how you asked it.
[51:44.53]I don't know why I just put that on you.
[51:47.51]Like, oh, your creative process.
[51:50.89]Uh, but I have a lot of stuff that has just never, ever happened.
[51:54.49]That is in the book of things that I've always, like, kind of wanted to do.
[51:59.28]And that's why, why would I talk about them?
[52:00.50]Because if I don't, what if they do happen?
[52:03.28]I don't know.
[52:09.01]Like I told you, in this, I have no plans to do anything.
[52:12.58]And I'm happier that way.
[52:14.56]If I feel like doing something, or if something comes along and it's like, you can do whatever the fuck you want... What is it?
[52:24.57]Let's do it.
[52:25.46]Okay.
[52:26.54]Then maybe if I get the urge to do that, then maybe.
[52:37.65]Hey look, your population rebounded.
[52:39.11]Don't even worry about losing them.
[52:41.29]They did, you're right.
[52:42.58]Nice.
[52:44.52]Pack of s- Oh.
[52:49.62]Well, ten more people died, so good timing on your part.
[52:56.25]I need more.
[52:58.28]Okay.
[53:00.00]Two more huts, and I'm done.
[53:13.39]Stop making plans.
[53:14.25]You'll be happy.
[53:14.83]You know what?
[53:15.63]I need that.
[53:19.26]I think from 2019, 28, like let's call it like 2019, 2020 to like 2022 and a half, 2023.
[53:31.11]I just felt like I needed a plan for every single thing that happened every day.
[53:35.36]It's like, oh, I need to make sure that this is funny or this is good.
[53:37.96]I got to have, what am I doing on next Thursday?
[53:40.18]I need to know because I have to prepare for it.
[53:42.17]I got to make sure it's good.
[53:45.37]I think that especially in that like 2020 to 2022 range.
[53:54.98]But it's good to be busy, right?
[53:56.24]It's good to like always have something going on in your mind and always be doing something.
[54:11.78]You're not going to worry about those things.
[54:15.29]No, I know.
[54:15.95]I know.
[54:17.19]What I'm mainly talking about is just the need to do something.
[54:20.56]And I think it's like three or four years ago I said that a lot of the event stuff is what I really liked.
[54:30.83]And doing the let's call them computer streams was just a kind of a way in a means to do them and continue to do the big things.
[54:40.10]But then after doing a handful of big things, you realize like how much it actually.
[54:44.80]How much money and time it actually is to do some of those.
[54:48.59]And then you start to go OK, well.
[54:51.85]Uh.
[54:53.05]Do I sure is this possible to kind of just keep doing this?
[55:02.96]And I kind of trapped myself in a way of... Oh, I want to do another huge thing.
[55:08.93]It's got to be massive.
[55:11.47]And I kind of got that power creep mindset where... Well, the next thing has to be way cooler and crazier than the last one.
[55:30.11]So I kind of had a period where I was like, you know what?
[55:31.89]Let's just not...
[55:34.70]Oh, a wanderer arrives with an empty cart.
[55:36.80]Says if she leaves with furs, she'll be back with more.
[55:40.05]Builder's not sure she's to be trusted.
[55:43.59]I'm doing a big gamble.
[55:45.25]You take 500 fur.
[55:53.35]You took everything!
[55:54.53]You took everything from me.
[55:57.69]No, no, we're sending a fucking party of people to go find you and get the fur back.
[56:03.34]With interest.
[56:07.03]I just lost all my fur.
[56:08.96]That's awful.
[56:11.60]That's actually bad.
[56:12.88]You piece of shit.
[56:21.95]Why did I trust you immediately?
[56:23.60]Hey, you give me... You give me 0.2 fur, I'll come back with 3 fur.
[56:35.71]God.
[56:45.36]How'd you feel back in 2017 to 2019 about streaming?
[56:52.48]How calm can... Yeah, a lot of... In, like, the early days of me streaming, around, like, 2016-ish, 2017, 18, I was fighting more with the quality of the... and the stability of the internet.
[57:07.34]A lot of stuff that I wanted to do that I was having fun doing would just get cut short or... It was just... It was literally rolling dice that if you could even stream or not.
[57:16.41]um it feels like a lot of the internet issues have I mean almost disintegrated in the last three to four years but also too I mean 2016 2017 you're talking about people are stealing from me what was I saying
[57:44.79]Oh right, yeah, so.
[57:49.20]When alright, I'm not doing anymore of these.
[57:53.81]Oh, you fucking idiot.
[57:55.09]I just had to click it.
[58:04.27]OK, let's start making more leather.
[58:11.77]But yeah, back then it was a fight against actually streaming because I didn't have a gigabit line back then.
[58:22.35]I was operating on like Comcast's family plan.
[58:28.18]It was like 100 down and like 10 up.
[58:32.49]It kind of didn't really exist.
[58:36.44]So you didn't really have the padding if you had an internet problem.
[58:41.95]You know, if you're getting 10% of your speeds at, you know, 200 down, 20 up, or 10 up, that's not enough to stream.
[58:53.02]And sometimes it would just go down to five percentile for six straight hours.
[58:58.45]Every day, the same time every day.
[59:01.83]And we went through...
[59:04.49]So I remember even back when I first moved to Vegas too.
[59:08.74]I remember Etalyx and I, it was like we moved across the country.
[59:13.92]And it was still bad.
[59:15.59]It was worse than it was before I moved.
[59:20.15]So yeah, I don't know.
[59:21.46]I guess the string of luck of just having a more stable internet recently, like the last five years or so, last 10 years, I'd say, like since the second... How long have I been in Vegas for?
[59:35.93]it's been seven years now if it's that's crazy to think about that 2018 I think yeah it was the later half of 2018. but a long time a beggar arrives ask for any spare furs to keep him warm take a hundred pile of furs left on the ground the beggar says thanks leaves a pile of small teeth behind wait his teeth
[60:10.17]Did you move to Vegas because you like gambling?
[60:12.39]No.
[60:14.35]I moved to Vegas because it was... Remember, this is pre-COVID too.
[60:17.90]This is before COVID.
[60:20.64]It was a 24-hour city.
[60:24.32]Everything was always on.
[60:25.91]The lights never turned off.
[60:28.77]I was a really big night owl kind of person.
[60:33.17]Especially back in 2017, 2016.
[60:35.16]About 10 years ago.
[60:39.42]And...
[60:40.46]I remember when you're sitting there streaming, I didn't really take food breaks or, hey guys, I'm going to leave or I'll be back or I would eat or, you know, you get trying to do most of the stuff that you want to get done for the day before you start streaming.
[60:58.79]And yeah, I would say my streams averaged six and a half to eight and a half hours.
[61:05.11]So, you know, if you're there for about eight hours, I don't take like a lunch or anything or dinner break or anything.
[61:13.52]So I would just kind of sit there.
[61:14.60]I want to just sit there and just go, especially back then.
[61:23.37]So when I would be done streaming, sometimes it would be 10, 11, 12 o'clock at midnight.
[61:30.82]Or later sometimes.
[61:33.15]And being in Vegas meant you could go get a five-star steak at 2 a.m.
[61:39.26]if you wanted to.
[61:40.94]Some of the best food you could ever want was available.
[61:45.25]Always.
[61:45.53]24-7.
[61:53.78]But that was pre-COVID and after COVID, a lot of the 24-7 kind of style of places and really, really late night stuff really is more concentrated to the Strip and a lot of the tourist places, which I don't really do.
[62:06.47]I don't really go to.
[62:09.60]I'm not like going to the Strip every day to go get like dinner.
[62:12.92]That's not... No.
[62:17.36]But another reason was it was close to California.
[62:21.11]And...
[62:23.46]LA was kind of a place to be in 2019, 2020, 2021.
[62:29.47]It was a lot of stuff going on there.
[62:31.96]A lot of the Twitch stuff was going on there.
[62:33.64]So I was like, you know what?
[62:34.56]I don't have to live in California.
[62:38.11]I didn't have to live in LA, but I could be there in 40 minutes.
[62:44.10]Yeah, for production stuff and events and things, it seemed like it was easier to do some stuff out there.
[62:51.92]And I say that, but almost every major event stream was at least 500 miles away from California.
[63:08.27]Is Vegas that close to LA?
[63:09.99]Oh yeah.
[63:11.47]You can get to LA in about.
[63:14.43]Four hours in a car.
[63:16.74]About 38 minutes, 45 minutes.
[63:20.76]The fly out.
[63:23.76]I think it's like an like an hour, but.
[63:27.51]What I'm thinking of is after takeoff.
[63:29.81]From takeoff to landing, it's about 38 minutes.
[63:43.32]Private air.
[63:44.60]His private air balloon.
[63:46.44]Yeah.
[63:46.56]Alright.
[63:46.78]Let me, hold on.
[63:47.12]Let me do this.
[63:47.54]I got so much shit.
[63:50.02]I'm going to do a... Oh, I'm so glad it didn't let me do that.
[63:54.75]I don't have any wood.
[63:55.39]Alright.
[63:59.74]I need to do... Where is it?
[64:03.40]Okay.
[64:03.54]I have a... I need a wagon.
[64:07.71]The wagon can carry a lot of supplies.
[64:10.97]Oh, hell yeah.
[64:12.96]Alright, I'm going for... I'm going on an embark.
[64:16.70]Let's take an iron sword.
[64:19.28]Torch.
[64:21.11]Bunch of meat.
[64:22.33]I'm gonna take... Okay, that's good.
[64:24.93]I have armor on, right?
[64:25.87]I got, yep, leather armor.
[64:26.95]20 water.
[64:28.86]Go.
[64:33.08]Snarling beast.
[64:38.19]Easy.
[64:38.35]Easy.
[64:41.03]I think I'm just going to leave a lot of this stuff because I only want it if it's good.
[64:47.27]An old house.
[64:48.26]An old house remains here once white siding.
[64:50.12]Okay, go in.
[64:56.30]Okay.
[64:56.90]A man charges down the hall.
[65:00.71]Floth is good.
[65:01.31]I'll take it.
[65:06.07]I wouldn't think I should go up.
[65:08.38]I'm going up.
[65:11.30]An old house.
[65:19.32]Yep.
[65:19.42]I'll take another cloth.
[65:24.21]I don't want to run.
[65:24.69]How many steps is it?
[65:25.67]I want to make sure I have water.
[65:26.73]What is... Oh.
[65:28.13]A huge lizard.
[65:30.62]Oh my god.
[65:31.48]Okay.
[65:32.32]Very bad.
[65:33.68]Okay.
[65:42.32]Teeth.
[65:45.91]Mmm.
[65:49.07]Water is your steps.
[65:50.07]Yeah, I can.
[65:50.97]I gotta be careful.
[65:58.05]Scales I'll take the scales.
[66:01.93]Alright, oh.
[66:03.75]A deserted town.
[66:05.47]A small suburb lays ahead, empty houses scorched and peeling.
[66:08.75]Broken streetlights stand, rusting.
[66:10.54]Light hasn't graced this place in a long time.
[66:13.40]Uh oh.
[66:15.88]Oh my god.
[66:20.05]I got ambushed.
[66:26.13]Ah!
[66:27.93]Ugh, okay.
[66:30.82]He had more cloth.
[66:34.46]I mean, I'll take the leather.
[66:35.74]Why not?
[66:39.09]An overturned caravan is spread across the mock-marked street.
[66:44.08]It's been picked over by scavengers, but there's still some things worth taking.
[66:49.78]Some meat.
[66:50.28]I'll take it.
[66:54.39]Okay.
[66:56.31]Something's causing a commotion a ways down the road.
[66:58.98]A fight, maybe.
[67:03.05]Oh my god, he fucking can kill me in one hit.
[67:15.43]No!
[67:21.39]What do you have?
[67:22.81]This dude had a steel sword.
[67:24.21]Give it to me.
[67:33.22]I gotta leave.
[67:33.88]Okay, I'm leaving after that.
[67:36.54]Beneath the wanderer's rags, clutched in one of his many hands, a glint of steel.
[67:42.19]He's got a rifle!
[67:43.43]He's got a gun, and he's got bullets!
[67:48.46]I'm taking this shit back.
[67:51.86]Okay.
[67:52.97]Get me out.
[67:54.45]I'm done.
[68:00.38]Hell yeah, let's go.
[68:02.47]Alright, I have a gun now.
[68:03.79]How much damage does a gun do?
[68:11.60]I'll take a look at this in a minute.
[68:13.14]When are you going to do ToeJam & Earl?
[68:19.63]Next Friday!
[68:27.52]By the way, I'm not doing ToeJam & Earl next Friday.
[68:31.27]Sorry to get you hopes up there.
[68:34.32]Okay.
[68:38.00]I need... What do I need?
[68:45.05]Iron armor, definitely.
[68:46.31]I need 100 iron and 30 leather.
[68:50.06]I got it.
[68:52.86]I'll take a cask.
[68:55.89]Even more water.
[69:00.33]I think I'm good to do another run.
[69:05.57]Oh, maybe I can make some bullets.
[69:06.92]Yeah.
[69:08.78]OK.
[69:11.42]Let's do another run.
[69:12.16]I'm going to go to that other town that was next to that one.
[69:26.94]I think I can only have can I have more than three weapons?
[69:38.96]Have you seen this year's F3?
[69:39.92]Um... What's F3?
[69:47.82]Take as many as you want.
[69:50.35]And just spam it?
[69:55.03]An old wanderer arrived.
[69:56.59]He smiles warmly and asks for lodgings for the night.
[70:00.10]That's fine.
[70:01.66]Oh, I don't have enough?
[70:05.12]How much meat do I have?
[70:06.26]Oh, fuck.
[70:06.86]Hold on a second.
[70:07.70]Hold on.
[70:08.16]Wait, wait, wait.
[70:15.37]80 meat and how much meat do I have?
[70:18.28]I have so much meat.
[70:24.72]We need to use some of this.
[70:25.52]We need more wood.
[70:29.59]Okay, that's going to drain my meat so fast.
[70:33.67]50 wood and 50 meat.
[70:46.15]OK, so this will make more cured meat.
[70:51.42]Will go through this pretty quickly, OK?
[70:56.65]Jeremy, you remember when this was the only type of game?
[71:00.01]I was a little.
[71:01.59]This passed me by about 5 to 10 years, I think.
[71:06.06]Not this game in particular, but by this kind of dial of original roguelike on like the Apple 2.
[71:15.01]I did get a chance to use an old apple too, though.
[71:18.91]I remember Shufflepuck.
[71:21.34]There was a game called Shufflepuck Cafe.
[71:24.72]And the game was crazy.
[71:25.90]I remember playing it when I was like five.
[71:31.69]Alright, let's go embark again.
[71:37.00]Are we good?
[71:39.64]Alright, I'm going up.
[71:44.59]Beast.
[71:47.45]We're good.
[71:50.66]I have so many.
[71:52.40]I am carrying a one-man band amount of stuff.
[72:04.97]I've got a tuba.
[72:06.01]I've got a French horn.
[72:07.90]I've got a tambourine.
[72:17.55]I'm going all the way up.
[72:20.65]Alright, here we go.
[72:21.31]Town.
[72:32.32]What do you got?
[72:37.47]Off.
[72:42.23]We're going to get a ballot row stream I have played.
[72:45.44]100 million hours of ballot row on my own.
[72:48.71]So probably not.
[72:57.02]Actually take more.
[73:00.02]A small basket of food is hidden under a park bench with a note attached.
[73:03.76]I can't read the words.
[73:06.13]Hopefully doesn't say poisoned.
[73:17.13]Okay, that guy's awful.
[73:19.82]But, what does he have?
[73:24.84]You had nothing on you, dude.
[73:31.93]Did that guy seriously have nothing on him?
[73:36.54]Carry this much.
[73:37.46]Wagon can only carry a maximum of 500.
[73:40.12]Oh, what?
[73:42.18]What?
[73:43.65]What?!
[73:43.91]!
[73:48.49]Okay, what is it?
[73:50.23]Another rifle and more bullets.
[73:52.85]Maybe I should take the other rifle.
[74:03.01]I'd imagine they're probably expensive.
[74:06.33]Okay, I gotta go back.
[74:10.23]Oh fuck!
[74:11.92]Is there any water?
[74:12.66]Where's water?
[74:14.02]Is there water anywhere?
[74:18.34]I'm gonna Minecraft lose everything.
[74:21.32]Is it water right here?
[74:27.11]Is V water?
[74:27.95]The Earth here is split.
[74:37.02]The remains of an old campsite sits inside the cave.
[74:39.62]Bedrolls, corn, blackened, lay beneath a thin layer of dust.
[74:43.98]Give me some water.
[74:46.47]I don't want meat or leather.
[74:47.65]I want water.
[74:55.04]No.
[74:57.96]There's a lizard.
[75:00.28]No.
[75:04.73]Oh, fuck you.
[75:06.49]What's a bolo?
[75:08.45]Bola?
[75:10.60]This is a steel.
[75:11.82]I'm not even going to make it.
[75:14.10]I can't make it back.
[75:16.56]I'm dead.
[75:18.22]Uh oh.
[75:20.50]Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Uh... Shit!
[75:44.24]I can't drop these?
[75:48.32]I'm not going to make it.
[75:50.56]One, two, fuck.
[76:00.33]No, I lost all my weapons.
[76:04.25]That's a disaster.
[76:06.86]That's actually a disaster.
[76:14.87]That's not good.
[76:17.90]What the fuck?
[76:25.30]A wanderer arrives with an empty cart.
[76:26.69]If he leaves with wood, he'll be back with more.
[76:29.77]Give him a 500 wood.
[76:34.65]Is that the same guy that wanted 500 fur?
[76:37.37]He just asked for a 500 of something else?
[76:43.74]Why did that guy not get killed on sight?
[76:50.05]Oh boy, this is a setback.
[76:53.55]This is a setback.
[76:56.19]This is a big setback.
[77:06.45]She looks weary almost as if every death affects her too.
[77:10.33]The locket around her neck glows brightly, a healing light.
[77:17.28]Alright, well... What do I need?
[77:20.17]Shit!
[77:25.13]I had a gun, too.
[77:26.27]I had a... That thing was doing 8 damage a hit.
[77:31.70]That's actually really annoying.
[77:38.01]Keys on the map have water?
[77:41.58]Good to know.
[77:46.00]Um...
[77:53.34]I need, what's like the next upgrade path here?
[77:56.31]I think I have to go find something and bring it back.
[78:00.39]I think I have to get steel and bring steel back.
[78:03.94]Alright, we're going for a who cares run.
[78:07.94]I have an iron sword and let's take 10 meat.
[78:13.51]Let's go.
[78:19.78]What the hell was that?
[78:24.29]A gaunt man approaches?
[78:25.64]Let's go to the town.
[78:52.64]Give me something more than that, dude.
[78:55.61]Come on, man.
[79:01.78]This guy's swinging like crazy.
[79:05.56]Oh shit!
[79:06.60]Why is he going so fast?
[79:18.52]Okay, there's a commotion.
[79:35.02]Alright.
[79:35.96]Please tell me you had something.
[79:41.81]Here we go.
[79:42.17]Picking the bones.
[79:42.77]Find some useful trinkets.
[79:45.53]Three bolas.
[79:48.26]Iron.
[79:49.34]Give me a steel sword.
[79:59.53]I need a pea.
[80:02.14]That was pea.
[80:04.50]No, go back, go back, go back, go back.
[80:07.00]Okay, water replenished.
[80:08.16]Go inside.
[80:09.20]Safe place in the wilds.
[80:14.43]Okay, now I can go... I can keep going to the left.
[80:18.09]Big creature.
[80:23.20]I can throw the bolas?
[80:28.06]It's pee after you clear it out.
[80:30.04]Oh, okay, cool.
[80:32.55]Been a long time since I've played.
[80:38.89]This is so dumb to go this far.
[80:41.37]Huge lizard.
[80:51.21]They do so much damage.
[80:53.97]I don't think I can take anything, really.
[80:55.47]I'm out of space.
[81:01.26]You maybe have the worst nightmare I've had in my life.
[81:03.49]I only get them after I watch two VODs.
[81:07.81]Dude, don't blame me for you eating like a steak and cheese sub at 1 o'clock in the morning and then going to bed.
[81:18.87]Go back.
[81:22.43]What the fuck?
[81:23.81]I screwed it up already!
[81:24.98]No!
[81:25.64]I... How is there nothing here?
[81:31.00]There wasn't anything there?
[81:32.51]I lost it all again!
[81:36.26]I thought there was going to be something there.
[81:40.21]Alright, don't screw it up this time.
[81:59.33]I can't even go yet.
[82:08.17]Alright, I have like a hundred.
[82:09.35]There's 72 people that are going to be living here.
[82:12.52]Let's go.
[82:13.46]I need more.
[82:19.37]I need more meat.
[82:23.81]Let's get a bunch of meat.
[82:32.02]Make sure there's at least people doing that.
[82:36.69]Okay, I have a lot of... No, I actually don't have a lot of meat.
[82:39.94]We're not doing any curing.
[82:42.12]This is good for now.
[82:44.30]Alright, here we go.
[82:46.64]Alright, I'm going up.
[82:51.11]A bird.
[82:52.45]Dead.
[82:56.95]Was your favorite Pee-Wee's Playhouse character?
[83:00.06]Uh, that'd be Cherry.
[83:07.42]Where the windows of the schoolhouse aren't shattered, they're blackened with soot.
[83:11.02]I need a torch to go in here?
[83:13.85]Small cache of supplies is tucked inside.
[83:15.53]Um, okay.
[83:24.48]A beast.
[83:28.18]Jesus.
[83:35.35]Ugh!
[83:37.37]I feel like Jason's behind me or Mike Myers.
[83:58.07]Don't let this panicked scavenger kill me.
[84:01.15]That would be embarrassing.
[84:08.32]Something better than leather.
[84:09.38]Come on, dude.
[84:16.49]Scavenger has been looking for supplies in here.
[84:18.56]It seems shame to let what he'd found go to waste.
[84:23.04]OK, I have to get this call back.
[84:24.42]I'm going to unlock something with it for sure.
[84:26.07]I'm just leaving.
[84:31.21]Yeah, I'm done.
[84:32.89]Let me refill.
[84:38.11]And I'm just like, I wanna bring the coal back.
[84:45.40]Yeah, screw that.
[84:46.36]I'm outta here.
[85:00.68]Oh, take the teeth.
[85:04.35]Okay, I brought back coal.
[85:06.76]Builder says the villagers could make steel given the tools.
[85:10.37]Here we go.
[85:15.37]Steel works.
[85:16.10]600 wood, 100 iron, 100 coal.
[85:21.32]Where am I going to get all that coal from?
[85:24.65]The last album you listened to?
[85:25.81]Um.
[85:31.96]That's a good question.
[85:33.20]Start to finish?
[85:36.16]It's been a long time.
[85:37.02]I really don't think I give you an answer.
[85:41.18]Hey, can I make coal?
[85:45.25]I need to do.
[85:45.73]I need to actually go get it.
[85:55.51]I trade for it.
[85:56.41]OK, I can.
[85:57.13]30 for five teeth.
[86:04.68]How much fur?
[86:05.12]I don't have any fur.
[86:06.10]What is going on?
[86:09.00]No way.
[86:18.09]We need coal.
[86:18.73]I'm just going to have everybody on fur duty.
[86:23.94]I have tons of wood.
[86:24.68]A pack of snarling beasts pours up from the trees.
[86:32.01]You killed ten people.
[86:33.29]Great.
[86:38.43]When you say you don't listen to a lot of music, do you mean songs or do you mean any game soundtracks?
[86:46.05]It's funny, I actually sat down after the Monster Rancher stuff and I thought to myself, if I really had to sit there and think about it, what are songs that I actually like in albums and artists that I listen to?
[87:01.27]And I went down this rabbit hole of
[87:04.75]Going back to the 2000s, the 90s, the... Oh, remember when these singles, remember these big hits, remember this band?
[87:13.63]I completely forgot about Smashing Pumpkins.
[87:19.40]I just forgot.
[87:19.88]I forgot they even existed.
[87:25.41]And their music, I've listened to a lot of their music before.
[87:30.23]Like, Tonight Tonight?
[87:32.32]What a great song that is.
[87:33.40]That's definitely, has to be up there.
[87:37.06]You just kind of forget everything until you get reminded of something that you like.
[87:40.73]It's weird.
[87:41.09]A lot of the Radiohead stuff, I was like, oh yeah, Radiohead.
[87:49.85]They are good.
[88:02.06]OK, I'm in a good spot.
[88:03.56]Look at all this.
[88:07.10]Let's make some coal.
[88:12.49]How many do I need?
[88:13.07]Like a lot of this, don't I?
[88:22.74]Need 100.
[88:23.22]Let me get a good, uh, matching pumpkins impression.
[88:31.03]The world is a vampire.
[88:35.84]I don't know the lyrics.
[88:44.79]Even though I know all my fools and know like a dog.
[88:56.77]Despite all my rage, I'm still just a-running the cage.
[89:02.58]And someone will say what is lost can never be saved.
[89:08.72]Somebody said what is lost can never be saved.
[89:20.84]That woke somebody up.
[89:24.85]Alright, I need more coal.
[89:31.20]Oh, you want $500?
[89:32.64]Sure, take it.
[89:39.28]I need more teeth.
[89:39.98]Where do you get teeth from?
[89:41.62]Crapping, right?
[89:54.97]The Monster Ranch 2 tournament's gonna slap.
[89:58.09]I think it's gonna.
[89:58.81]I think it's gonna be great.
[90:02.76]How do I get teeth?
[90:05.04]Do I have to go scavenge for it?
[90:06.46]I guess I could parade for it.
[90:07.72]30 fur.
[90:12.38]I apologize to your ears.
[90:22.71]Shit.
[90:23.41]I need way more fur.
[90:34.22]I've never understood a game less.
[90:40.93]Has it already been an hour?
[90:42.81]What have I been doing here?
[90:44.03]Just like kind of talking?
[90:48.34]I need more coal.
[90:50.06]I maxed out how many traps I can even have.
[91:01.72]Where are the graphics?
[91:03.84]Did you see that V guy that was coming after me?
[91:08.42]There was a V guy and he was like... Let's do this.
[91:22.85]Apologize in advance for this.
[91:27.11]This is going to take me ages.
[91:28.74]Okay.
[91:30.48]I am going to take a break and I'm going to leave it on this menu.
[91:36.41]And we're going to just sit here and just get a ton of fur while I go take a break.
[91:43.46]I'm just going to write it on the screen.
[91:56.22]This is an old...
[92:00.89]okay hey look at this the House Flipper invitational I'll be back in a few minutes
[92:32.82]There.
[92:37.75]Alright, I'll be right back.
[92:38.98]When I come back, I better have three of 10,000 fur.
[92:42.65]Be back in two minutes.
[96:52.22]I'm back.
[96:53.22]So I come sit down.
[96:55.01]I'm just looking over.
[96:55.83]I just see people say, kill him.
[96:58.67]Kill, kill, kill.
[96:59.67]I'm like, oh my God, what did I do?
[97:01.06]What did I do?
[97:03.98]And then I look up.
[97:04.92]Oh.
[97:07.47]Let me just get a fresh beer.
[97:10.05]That's it.
[97:10.47]There we are.
[97:16.34]Okay.
[97:16.72]Um.
[97:19.56]Wait, you guys did a poll?
[97:20.62]50% do it again.
[97:23.06]You have to do it again.
[97:28.75]Make sure you vote in the poll.
[97:33.20]That's too close to call.
[97:36.44]The villagers haul a filthy man out of the storeroom.
[97:39.61]Say his folk have been skimming the supplies.
[97:42.11]Say he should be strung up.
[97:46.98]This happened five seconds after you left, so you got no fur.
[97:49.76]Well, that's great.
[97:56.01]Good news.
[98:03.40]Alright, what are we doing?
[98:13.01]I forgot how good these were.
[98:19.51]The Blood Orange San Pellegrinos.
[98:22.70]These are good.
[98:24.04]I haven't had one of these in like years.
[98:31.99]I just saw it the other day.
[98:32.97]I was like, oh, I remember that.
[98:36.74]These are really good.
[98:40.41]Alright, we're going to forgive him.
[98:42.68]Forgive.
[98:43.86]The man says he's grateful, says he won't come around anymore.
[98:46.73]Shares what he knows about sneaking before he goes.
[98:50.55]I can sneak now?
[98:53.25]Learned how not to be seen.
[98:54.80]Okay.
[99:01.48]Kind of cool.
[99:05.81]Uh, alright.
[99:06.21]Stranger arrives in the night.
[99:08.89]We have 76.
[99:11.13]Ugh.
[99:13.14]Okay, I need... Did I not get any fur?
[99:16.07]Not really.
[99:19.97]I apologize.
[99:33.52]I'm sorry.
[99:34.18]That is awful.
[99:35.60]That is not good to listen to.
[99:40.50]Alright, now I can just sit here and we can just talk.
[99:43.40]Yeah, what do you guys have to say?
[99:45.06]What do you guys want to talk about?
[99:53.09]Are you going to watch the Mortuary Assistant movie?
[99:55.78]Didn't even know there was a movie.
[100:01.58]I don't know man, this is your stream.
[100:03.75]It's true.
[100:04.15]What do I want to talk about?
[100:06.19]I want to talk about.
[100:08.51]Wait, I have jewels.
[100:13.88]What can I do with these?
[100:14.72]Can I sell them?
[100:18.84]Where did I get these jewels?
[100:28.52]What?
[100:31.18]I have so much meat.
[100:32.10]It's actually crazy.
[100:38.87]Almost there.
[100:45.37]Almost there.
[100:46.27]I have 600 iron.
[100:54.62]Why is Virgo Libra a tag for this stream?
[100:59.81]Somebody played a practical joke on me.
[101:03.19]Should have seen my reaction.
[101:04.16]The cameras were all on me.
[101:05.76]I was like, what's going on?
[101:07.28]This can't be real.
[101:28.43]Why do you switch from team team Edward to team Jacob?
[101:32.05]I felt like.
[101:36.56]Take which is kind of more me.
[101:42.24]I know, especially when I get up in the morning.
[101:45.41]My hair is longer now.
[101:47.11]I got a big beard and everything.
[101:48.67]I feel like I'm much more Jacob now.
[101:53.37]Oh, he dropped teeth.
[101:59.31]Dude, one of these days I'm going to turn the cam on.
[102:01.20]And I'm going to have a really short haircut.
[102:03.74]No facial hair.
[102:04.82]And I'm going to have a tie on.
[102:08.37]It's going to be so off-putting to everybody.
[102:10.57]It's going to be so jarring.
[102:14.22]I'm going to look so weird.
[102:16.54]I'm going to look bizarre to all of you.
[102:20.43]Alright, come on.
[102:20.93]Let's go.
[102:30.07]More hurry.
[102:43.05]He tried your look with your baseball cap.
[102:46.93]I actually don't really wear baseball hats anymore.
[102:51.81]If you had told me 5 to 10 years ago that I was not going to be wearing baseball hats everywhere anymore.
[102:57.30]I would just.
[102:57.76]I thought you were lying.
[103:04.33]I just don't really do it anymore.
[103:13.22]I need more villagers.
[103:23.18]Teeth.
[103:30.44]You ever seen Succession?
[103:32.58]I saw the first few episodes.
[103:39.02]I saw there was a scene where it's like if you hit a home run or something, I'll give you a million dollars if you hit a home run.
[103:47.87]And then in my brain, that scene transitions to McDonald's has the greatest quarter pounder in history.
[103:56.02]Oh, and the chicken McNuggets.
[103:58.00]That's all I can think of.
[104:01.30]The McDonald's corn pounder with cheese.
[104:06.43]It's dripping with delicious juices.
[104:12.44]I can't see that.
[104:13.74]That was Succession episode two, in my mind.
[104:36.92]I'm so close to not doing that sound.
[104:39.73]I'm sorry.
[104:46.76]If McDonald's ever sponsored one of your streams, I think all your dreams would come true.
[104:50.10]I haven't really eaten it in a long time.
[104:52.06]If this was 2020, maybe.
[104:57.77]But I have not eaten McDonald's in almost a year.
[105:02.96]That's accurate.
[105:04.87]You can do Kappa's all you want.
[105:06.61]It's true.
[105:19.27]Last time I promise.
[105:27.14]It's so close.
[105:32.44]You would shake Ronald McDonald's hand on camera.
[105:36.27]I would be Ronald McDonald's running mate if he asked me.
[105:56.92]Ronald's 2028.
[106:06.43]What the hell is this?
[106:07.87]A nomad shuffles into view, laden with a mixture of bags bound with rough twine.
[106:13.90]Won't say from where he came, the prices are good, however.
[106:18.05]By bait.
[106:20.17]Is this bait?
[106:27.15]He looks over and just goes, did you bait it?
[106:36.79]You know, okay, somebody said, what about the, the, the McJerma meal?
[106:40.83]I would, you want to know what I would do?
[106:42.92]I would, I would mess up the whole thing.
[106:45.80]My McDonald's meal would be a cup of water.
[106:52.11]A single small cup of water.
[106:55.19]And that's it.
[106:58.56]Do you think they could market that at all?
[107:00.14]Would it even be possible to market that?
[107:04.02]Yeah, a small unsalted fry and a cup of water.
[107:12.01]Yeah, and a filet of fish, no bun.
[107:15.41]It's just, it's the fish and chips.
[107:18.66]I'm surprised they haven't done some dumb shit like that.
[107:22.70]You know, the commercial would be playing British music.
[107:25.90]Try the new McDonald's fish and chips.
[107:32.91]And it would be a bunless filet of fish on top of a bed of fries.
[107:38.77]And it would be some British soda or something.
[107:41.75]Like, oh, a nice Bev.
[107:45.44]Whatever the hell it would be.
[107:47.17]What would the British brink be?
[107:49.01]It'd be a tea.
[107:49.67]Yeah, it'd be a warm tea.
[108:02.75]Do you think anyone would... I feel like people like the Filet-O-Fish, though.
[108:05.97]Don't people say the Filet-O-Fish is one of the best things at McDonald's?
[108:15.91]Do you know that the original fish they used for the Filet-O-Fish got fished to almost extinction?
[108:20.37]So now they use a different blend of shittier fishes, which is why it tastes worse.
[108:25.48]Oh my god.
[108:26.72]Oh, dude!
[108:27.28]Big gamble!
[108:27.89]500 fur!
[108:36.60]A dark haze falls over the village as the steelworks fire up.
[108:45.05]Okay.
[108:47.07]We need- we skipped something here.
[108:59.74]What did we skip?
[109:01.06]Do I need to go back out and get something?
[109:04.31]A convoy.
[109:08.19]Water tank?
[109:09.71]Oh, steel armor?
[109:10.91]Let's go.
[109:11.49]I need to go to the mine.
[109:18.57]Alright, let's go on an adventure.
[109:23.99]Do I have nothing?
[109:25.64]I have nothing!
[109:30.16]Why would I take a jewel with me?
[109:32.35]What is this for?
[109:34.07]I'll do it.
[109:35.61]Erks?
[109:35.95]Erks?
[109:37.79]Oh.
[109:43.00]OK.
[109:44.32]Let's go up up up up up.
[109:49.05]Nice perk.
[109:54.88]What's B?
[109:55.49]Let's go check out B.
[110:06.51]Oh my god, this guy's hard.
[110:07.73]I don't have any heals!
[110:13.66]I don't have any heals!
[110:15.12]I don't have any heals!
[110:16.16]I didn't take any food!
[110:17.24]Alright, well, did you have any food?
[110:22.81]I'm not... I have a jewel with me.
[110:24.68]I gotta leave.
[110:33.01]Um...
[110:37.17]What happened?
[110:44.36]I starved to death because I didn't have any food.
[110:47.56]I lost a jewel.
[110:57.68]Hmm.
[110:57.78]Okay, I have the maximum you can... I have the cap of meat.
[111:07.07]We're at the meat cap.
[111:15.44]I need coal.
[111:16.26]I need.
[111:18.67]Oh, I gotta go to that mine.
[111:22.83]Alright, this is 45 fur.
[111:24.85]45 meat, which will give me 9 leather.
[111:29.80]That's a wash.
[111:30.84]That's good.
[111:31.28]Uh, 25 meat.
[111:34.10]I will have a meat surplus.
[111:35.20]That's fine.
[111:37.28]I can do more wood than that.
[111:43.61]Actually, I still want I want people chopping wood.
[111:45.57]Let's do 10.
[111:47.84]OK, so I got a guy there.
[111:53.61]Shit.
[112:01.90]Give me some food.
[112:04.77]Scratching noise.
[112:05.85]Oh no, they ate some wood.
[112:07.41]Who cares?
[112:16.89]Alright.
[112:17.63]Let's go.
[112:18.19]I need a mine.
[112:22.44]Mine.
[112:30.27]I just got iron from it.
[112:37.86]I do, I'm gonna go back to, I'm gonna go to B. I think I can handle it, whatever it is.
[112:52.18]Alright, I got 30 water.
[112:53.88]What is B?
[112:56.26]A huge borehole.
[112:58.38]Huge holes cut deep into the Earth, evidence of the past harvest.
[113:02.03]They took what they came for and left.
[113:05.32]Alien alloy.
[113:08.48]Uh, yeah?
[113:11.01]Goodbye.
[113:23.73]What can the builder do with this?
[113:35.41]Alien alloy is 3000 fur, scales and teeth.
[113:51.73]You got any more funny Dark Souls clips?
[113:54.74]Oh, I got the hundreds of clips.
[113:59.79]I remember I recorded a bunch of Red Dead Redemption 2 stuff.
[114:03.82]And I recorded this one clip in particular where I don't think it's particularly funny.
[114:10.14]It's me just flying off a cliff with a whole wagon.
[114:14.37]And just crashing down into a ravine.
[114:16.61]And it's not even that ridiculous.
[114:18.82]But I remember I had smoked some weed.
[114:23.64]And I thought it was the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.
[114:30.06]And it's actually kind of funny.
[114:31.59]If we ever do really go through these, there's hundreds of these clips, you'll be able to know which ones I recorded when I was high.
[114:43.55]Because I would say probably like a third of them, if there's three or 400 clips, maybe like 30 or 40 of them, maybe like 10 to 20% of them are just like, why did I record that?
[114:55.98]And I go, oh, now think about it if you were inebriated somehow.
[115:01.27]Then see if it makes sense.
[115:08.91]I'm getting an alloy right now.
[115:13.09]I have to go.
[115:14.06]This is obviously the shit that I'm missing.
[115:20.92]Can we get a zooted stream for real?
[115:23.57]I have not smoked.
[115:25.93]I have not been high off of marijuana.
[115:29.23]Cannabis.
[115:32.20]In about five or six months.
[115:34.46]At least six or seven months.
[115:39.80]I'm lying.
[115:40.34]I am not lying.
[115:41.04]I promise you.
[115:43.60]I dropped everything possible when I had, and you know, obviously I'm still having some issues by the way.
[115:52.22]I went like cold turkey, no fried food, no nothing.
[115:59.03]I even dropped coffee for a little while.
[116:01.01]That came back to it, right?
[116:01.88]I'm drinking some decaf at this point, but I eliminated every single possible avenue of every single thing in my entire diet.
[116:10.74]to see, because I had this insane flare-up last year that came well into this year, into January, February, March.
[116:21.79]I still am having issues, but holy shit, it's the worst colitis-type flare-up I've ever had in my whole life.
[116:30.18]In my entire life.
[116:33.23]I have no idea what triggered it, but when I talk about last year kind of sucked...
[116:39.80]Last year really sucked.
[116:42.04]The last, like, 12 calendar months before, let's say, like, May?
[116:47.49]March?
[116:49.89]Remember that?
[116:50.29]Remember Otto got really, really sick?
[116:52.31]He had to have so many procedures.
[116:53.65]They had to go, like, dig in his nose with and take samples out of his nasal cavity and it was... He was not doing good.
[117:02.76]He had a seizure and stuff.
[117:04.67]Like, it was really bad.
[117:07.17]Um...
[117:09.65]It was not good.
[117:10.51]I really was thinking that that could have been close to the end for auto.
[117:16.20]And then a month or two after that, I went down big time.
[117:21.76]Worse ever.
[117:22.58]Probably my whole life.
[117:28.19]And then other things that kind of in my personal life that have happened.
[117:32.55]So the middle part of 2024 all the way to like February of this year.
[117:38.81]There was just so much wild shit going on.
[117:51.39]Is Otto your husband?
[117:54.11]Uh, Otto is my dog.
[117:59.90]If you are a new viewer, they're like, oh, Otto, man.
[118:03.38]Me and Otto were having all kinds of trouble.
[118:06.81]It'd be like, who's Otto?
[118:17.30]Yeah, if you just got here a week ago, I have a question for you.
[118:21.77]Because this is, I've thought about this recently too.
[118:23.91]Get a poll in chat if we can.
[118:26.90]How many of you, and be honest, don't lie.
[118:31.08]Don't be like me, don't lie.
[118:33.29]How many people have only been here?
[118:38.17]You found the channel three months ago.
[118:40.10]Within three months.
[118:42.02]I really want to know this.
[118:42.78]I'm very curious about this.
[118:56.55]I'm gonna go right.
[118:59.76]This is such a bad idea.
[119:02.24]I'm gonna go up instead.
[119:09.73]There's a P right there.
[119:10.74]I gotta get a better weapon.
[119:27.23]I don't want this shit.
[119:32.82]Alright, here we go torch.
[119:36.04]There is a scavenger.
[119:42.59]Give me a steel sword.
[119:43.43]You have to have something on you, right?
[119:50.42]Shit, you're nothing.
[119:54.33]Through a large gymnasium door, footsteps can be heard.
[119:57.00]The torchlight casts a flickering glow down the hallway.
[119:59.58]The footsteps stop.
[120:16.72]Stop missing.
[120:20.28]There we go.
[120:20.86]Nice.
[120:21.28]Alright.
[120:21.60]Steel sword.
[120:23.60]Uh-oh.
[120:25.06]okay two steel swords definitely give you the bolas that's a bunch of steel I need this so bad okay I will be able to unlock some stuff if I come back with this uh I'm dropping the bone spear alright he and then leave
[120:59.42]Alright, are you a new viewer?
[121:00.76]Let's see.
[121:02.64]So 6% of you.
[121:07.13]Within three months.
[121:10.71]Are you a sword or a gun guy?
[121:13.10]I am an old gun guy.
[121:18.44]I'm talking Wild West, a little bit before Wild West.
[121:23.59]Pretty much every weapon in Fistful of Frags.
[121:31.20]six shooting revolvers are just that's just cool so mid-1800s yeah not quite muskets but that's sort of late 1800s like or like I would say like 1850 to like 1910. like 1915.
[122:01.27]Do you have any?
[122:02.87]I don't have any of these cool ones, no.
[122:12.28]Something about just the like... The sick shots.
[122:15.99]They're like... Hey, did you hear the Jerma movie bombed?
[122:24.42]Hold on, dude.
[122:25.06]I can't talk about this dumb shit right now.
[122:27.09]I have steel for the first time.
[122:32.94]Uh, drop the iron sword.
[122:34.26]I don't need it.
[122:35.41]And... Okay.
[122:40.01]Alright, I gotta go.
[122:51.93]Okay.
[122:55.10]I can make... I can make steel...
[123:02.79]I need, how, how do I get to build, uh, because I don't, I'm missing a step here.
[123:16.80]Uh, the movie bombed.
[123:19.17]Well, I don't care, the, the, the critics consensus was about, what, 12% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[123:25.09]People really didn't like that I, and whatever, they can say whatever they want.
[123:29.95]It's fine.
[123:31.25]They didn't like that I played every character.
[123:34.54]Even the people in the background on the subway scenes, they thought it was just dumb that I had different hats on and stuff.
[123:41.73]And we just green screen me in like five to 10,000 times.
[123:45.96]It took a lot of work though.
[123:47.16]So I guess I don't appreciate art.
[123:53.57]Yeah, one of the people that reviewed it, I don't know what publication it was, but they said that when I bought a ticket from myself at the train station, they said they got up and left the theater.
[124:09.26]But what if the audience percentage is at 36%, which that's pretty good.
[124:15.73]That's not bad.
[124:17.11]It could be way worse than that.
[124:24.92]The shpee scene got the critics pretty... Well, that scene got cut and then re-added because we did test screenings.
[124:33.91]There was the five-minute sequence where I was running away from all the shpees.
[124:40.08]And that's when they're popping their heads out of the window.
[124:42.59]Shpee, shpee.
[124:44.13]And they're all like the taxi cab driver I get.
[124:47.79]And I'm like, get me out of here.
[124:49.13]And he turns around and he goes, shpee.
[124:51.78]That's like the only part of the movie where it was in the movie.
[124:55.03]Uh, that actually was a lot longer.
[124:57.13]It was about a 15 minute segment rather than about four or five minutes.
[125:00.70]But the people that were testing, um, it really just did not do well with the test audiences, but they're not even like fans of the channel.
[125:07.17]So that's what I kept saying.
[125:08.87]I was like, I remember banging on the fucking two way glass saying like, you're not even fans of the channel.
[125:14.46]And I think some of them heard me, um,
[125:17.74]But it's alright, though.
[125:19.59]It did fine.
[125:21.91]It should take in like I think there was like nine releases this week.
[125:26.78]We're at number eight.
[125:28.80]We were at number eight for about an hour and then we went down to nine.
[125:32.29]They were doing like a reshowing of the Home Alone movies for like the 15th time.
[125:37.74]And it was I guess it went under that.
[125:48.46]This is not going to be a sequel.
[125:50.36]It's fine, though.
[126:00.77]I like this comment.
[126:02.66]Ha ha ha, funny with a raffle.
[126:04.64]Now, what guns do you own?
[126:14.07]Ha ha ha.
[126:14.27]Ha ha ha ha.
[126:18.54]I need to make coal, dude.
[126:21.87]How do you make coal?
[126:22.81]I need to go find a coal mine.
[126:25.52]Alright, we're going out again.
[126:32.59]I got... Steel sword is perfect.
[126:35.14]Will do a lot of damage.
[126:37.18]Let me make an iron sword because I feel like it.
[126:46.42]How much steel do I need?
[126:47.44]I have 200 leather, 100 steel.
[126:51.69]I'm missing something.
[126:58.30]Alright.
[127:00.45]I got three torches.
[127:01.81]I got tons of weapons.
[127:02.85]I got tons of water.
[127:05.67]Let's go.
[127:06.12]We think up.
[127:17.40]I don't need any of this.
[127:19.67]Clear the houses.
[127:28.05]Clear it.
[127:29.84]Into the mine.
[127:33.08]Mine.
[127:36.54]I don't want it.
[127:39.15]We're gonna go up to V. Inside.
[127:43.21]Earth is split.
[127:44.35]Ancient wound.
[127:45.87]Old camp.
[127:48.22]Take the food.
[127:50.36]Go.
[127:51.66]Fight.
[127:59.15]Kill.
[128:01.61]Loot.
[128:03.45]Steal.
[128:06.48]More bolas.
[128:08.68]More... Give me this too.
[128:11.18]I'm going to just take every weapon.
[128:12.28]Who cares?
[128:15.74]Alright.
[128:16.00]Let's refill.
[128:24.08]Okay.
[128:25.22]Up.
[128:28.66]Up.
[128:30.25]Refill.
[128:34.45]Left.
[128:37.20]A shot rings out from somewhere in the long grass?
[128:39.60]Uh-oh.
[128:42.81]Oh, I stunned him.
[128:43.53]Okay.
[128:47.55]This guy's got a gun and he's probably going to kill me.
[128:50.74]oh don't kill me please I'm only 500 pounds he didn't drop a rifle how did you not drop a rifle okay
[129:22.89]Come on, something!
[129:24.91]What's F?
[129:28.35]A forgotten battlefield?
[129:29.67]A battle was fought here long ago.
[129:31.96]Battered technology from both sides lays dormant on the blasted landscape.
[129:37.04]Oh my god.
[129:42.67]Rifle?
[129:44.57]Laser?
[129:47.80]Batteries?
[129:51.30]Grenades?
[129:54.43]Say everything with an exclaimed tone.
[129:57.41]I'm taking all the lasers.
[130:10.20]I'm dropping everything else I don't need.
[130:15.51]Who cares about the steel right?
[130:16.75]Fuck the steel.
[130:17.31]I can get it later.
[130:22.40]Uh, get rid of the iron sword.
[130:25.76]Get rid of the bone spear.
[130:31.15]Throw down a torch.
[130:32.05]I might... No, I'm leaving after this.
[130:33.81]You're right.
[130:45.56]Um... Ugh!
[130:56.76]Ugh.
[130:59.15]I kind of need the meat, though, to get back.
[131:06.80]Drop one of the rifles, maybe?

[132:14.40]Ugh!
[132:15.02]Okay.
[132:19.88]Get me the hell out of here.

[132:41.37]OK.
[132:45.43]I need to somebody said I need to find the letter C. I have so much meat, it's crazy.
[133:00.08]Alright, what do I need to change up here?
[133:01.85]I don't need meat right now.
[133:08.30]We'll get more wood.
[133:12.24]Yeah, so I'll make more cured meat with the meat here.
[133:19.46]Use up the meat.
[133:20.50]Get more wood.
[133:25.81]I need to find C on the map.
[133:33.33]Tell us about the main channel video you had idea for two years ago.
[133:37.69]No, I still might do that.
[133:40.02]I don't think it'd be on the main channel though.
[133:41.20]They could just be wherever.
[133:47.05]Would your lasers go?
[133:47.91]They're not here.
[133:49.47]They should be.
[133:56.01]Yeah, I got them.
[133:57.03]Lasers, wait.
[133:58.17]Yeah, no, they're here.
[134:00.58]An old wanderer arrives.
[134:01.78]He smiles.
[134:02.38]He asks for... Yeah, here.
[134:04.65]Not enough.
[134:05.15]Okay, we'll see you later.
[134:13.84]I definitely will take the rifle whenever I go anywhere.
[134:19.65]Steel sword, definitely.
[134:22.35]Grenade, definitely.
[134:23.24]I'll take... Yeah, four grenades is fine.
[134:28.54]Um, I'll take the bolas.
[134:34.31]And a few torches and then a bunch of meat.
[134:38.42]I'm already at 400 weight.
[134:40.34]Oh my God, dude.
[134:41.52]Okay, um.
[134:47.33]Leave some grenades, maybe?
[134:48.89]How do I already have so much shit?
[134:51.67]I need that bigger backpack.
[134:55.66]Would you star in a movie if somebody asked you to?
[134:57.54]No.
[134:57.66]No.
[134:59.20]No, I don't think so.
[135:01.83]Oh, I can make batteries with scales and teeth.
[135:06.96]Let me make some bullets.
[135:11.93]Okay.
[135:13.85]I need to go find C. This is fine.
[135:20.80]Rifle, steel sword, let's go.
[135:24.13]I'm going to go down and to the left.
[135:32.21]Fine.
[135:37.58]Come on, give me give me something.
[135:40.57]Hey.
[135:47.38]It's meat.
[135:49.38]What now?
[135:49.92]Yeah, give me the meat.
[135:51.02]What are you doing?
[135:56.27]OK.
[135:58.27]I've got a refill.
[135:59.22]Keep going.
[136:01.37]I don't want O. Fuck.
[136:16.31]Shit!
[136:17.35]I used so much to do that.
[136:25.16]Okay, loot.
[136:26.34]Take some more meat.
[136:29.23]Another fight.
[136:31.81]It's done.
[136:37.38]Come on, dude.
[136:44.61]Okay.
[136:45.89]Another rifle, so I'll take the bullets.
[136:51.93]Did I take the other rifle?
[136:58.62]What's your opinion on Kefir?
[136:59.70]Kefir's great.
[137:04.99]I love that stuff.
[137:12.79]I have to refill, but it's scary to be out here this far without.
[137:18.74]OK, this is kind of bad.
[137:23.45]I don't know what the... I don't know what that is, but I'm gonna check.
[137:27.34]Ruined city.
[137:28.94]Battered highway sign stands guard at the entrance of this once great city.
[137:33.00]Towers that still stand jut from the landscape like the ribcage of an ancient beast.
[137:38.03]Streets are empty.
[137:38.79]The air is filled with dust driven relentlessly by the hard winds.
[137:48.26]Come on.
[137:51.22]Okay.
[137:53.91]Nothing.
[138:00.44]Oh my God, he's swinging so I just threw a grenade at him.
[138:02.50]I don't care.
[138:07.31]The debris is denser here.
[138:08.29]Maybe some useful stuff in the rubble.
[138:11.59]One steel bar.
[138:12.76]That's all that was here, really?
[138:18.48]And then torches.
[138:23.48]Well, that sucks.
[138:26.50]But I can refill the water there.
[138:29.89]Let's go ahead and do that now.
[138:38.12]Alright, I'm going to go up.
[138:50.43]I don't want any of this.
[138:56.52]I'm supposed to be stealthy.
[138:58.12]What the hell happened?
[138:58.96]Another city.
[139:14.13]Stunned.
[139:23.03]You gonna play Neopets for my birthday?
[139:25.99]I can't.
[139:26.83]I'm busy.
[139:28.20]I'm so busy that day.
[139:32.38]Another city.
[139:35.89]Does meat good?
[139:56.46]Well, I don't need it.
[139:58.82]Inside the hut, a child cries.
[140:01.25]A few belongings rest against the walls.
[140:02.95]There's nothing else here.
[140:03.91]Am I... Am I a bad guy?
[140:08.92]I'm kind of bad.
[140:09.66]This is bad, isn't it?
[140:20.18]Okay, there's nothing else there.
[140:21.16]Let's fill here.
[140:25.97]I'm going to go right and then down.
[140:28.38]I don't care about that.
[140:35.98]Beast.
[140:40.57]Really?
[140:41.01]Come on.
[140:50.26]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[141:10.22]Ugh.
[141:14.47]Okay, I'm safe.
[141:15.41]Alright, now I can't fuck around.
[141:19.67]Yes, I can count.
[141:21.74]S. There's a new symbol here.
[141:24.20]S. This... Ooh!
[141:37.48]Bleah.
[141:39.23]Military is already set up at the mine's entrance.
[141:42.33]Soldiers patrol the perimeter.
[141:43.85]Rifles slow... This is not good.
[141:45.82]Am I strong enough for this?
[141:56.69]Oh, fuck.
[141:56.89]Okay, these guys are hard.
[142:03.30]Nothing else you don't... I need my, like, grenade...
[142:09.74]Fucking die!
[142:13.96]Ugh!
[142:14.08]I don't know if I got another one in me.
[142:22.43]Should I run?
[142:25.44]Fuck it, let's go.
[142:28.68]I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm dead.
[142:42.04]At least I know where that is.
[142:42.92]I lost all my shit.
[142:51.89]I'm so angry about it.
[143:03.01]I'm going back there.
[143:05.42]With grenades.
[143:15.35]Look how much iron I have.
[143:17.23]That's insanity.
[143:19.33]Okay, let's pull everything back.
[143:30.21]Okay.
[143:30.75]I got 2,700 iron.
[143:33.49]What can I do with the iron?
[143:36.92]I can make... How much steel do I need?
[143:44.19]Can I trade for it?
[143:52.96]Bullets, a lot of them.
[144:01.77]Maybe I should get some more batteries for the lasers and just take the lasers.
[144:08.02]I should still have a rifle, shouldn't I?
[144:13.31]Don't I have a rifle in my inventory?
[144:15.75]I don't?
[144:17.52]Since when?
[144:26.59]Alright, well I'm going to take a bunch of batteries then.
[144:35.41]Scales and teeth.
[144:39.52]Man, I made way too much iron.
[144:42.92]Like, way too much.
[144:52.50]Alright, steel is fur, scales, and teeth.
[144:57.50]You know what we're doing.
[145:14.75]Oh.
[145:15.63]Sure, take this.
[145:16.63]Whatever.
[145:26.53]Alright, I've got a bunch of fur coming in.
[145:30.04]Well, can I even spend the iron?
[145:31.40]I'm an idiot and I spent, I used way too much of it.
[145:33.54]Oh, wait.
[145:35.36]Yep, I'll make a ton of steel.
[145:45.13]I'll have enough iron to make like a thousand steel.
[145:50.96]Can you stream the drifter?
[145:52.90]Is it any, is it good?
[145:57.62]I don't need leather right now.
[145:58.86]I have so much of it.
[146:02.23]I don't... I've got... Actually, I could probably... I need cured meat.
[146:07.05]I could use some of it.
[146:12.68]It's incredible, really.
[146:13.89]I do... I need to find the coal.
[146:16.77]Alright, you know what?
[146:17.25]We're just gonna go for a random shithead run.
[146:19.68]I'm not taking anything important.
[146:24.40]I'm taking a... I'm gonna take a bone spear with me and I'm just gonna run around with a bone spear.
[146:39.34]Alright.
[146:40.00]I know that's important.
[146:41.38]I'm gonna go down.
[146:44.20]I died instantly!
[146:45.74]I didn't have any food?
[146:51.29]What the fuck happened?
[146:58.54]And now I need teeth.
[147:12.51]Okay, let's go.
[147:27.14]It's like an old school point and click in all the best ways.
[147:31.85]I love this game.
[147:32.71]It's great.
[147:34.23]The ensign is a lot more of the second part of the game.
[147:38.04]The embark part of the game from what I remember.
[147:41.00]Like a different... Oh.
[147:43.89]Scout says she's been all over.
[147:45.17]We'll need to talk about it for a price.
[147:48.19]Do I have a thousand fur?
[147:51.46]Damn it.
[147:51.90]I definitely can do a map, right?
[147:54.46]Business is done.
[147:55.10]She turns and walks away without saying a word.
[147:56.74]So can I see more of the map?
[148:03.39]Okay.
[148:04.34]I can see up there.
[148:06.90]I need C. I don't give a shit about anything else.
[148:25.91]The P letters signify a place to refill.
[148:33.72]Seems kind of crazy for as close to town as it is.
[148:52.92]Whatever.
[148:53.12]Whatever.
[148:54.52]Whatever.
[149:02.33]I got a lot of fur.
[149:03.43]I can... Okay.
[149:06.00]Steel.
[149:07.50]What do I need to make?
[149:08.26]I need to make... A water tank is 50 steel.
[149:15.03]I have 22.
[149:17.17]Make steel.
[149:19.54]I need fur, scales, and teeth.
[149:21.80]I need teeth, so I need a bunch.
[149:23.04]Okay, I'm so sorry, but here we go again.
[149:29.87]I can do it quick.
[149:30.57]Watch this.
[149:33.77]Shit, I just spent them all!
[150:02.57]Come on!
[150:08.28]Now I need scales.
[150:09.40]Where do I get scales?
[150:10.64]I need to... Hold on a second.
[150:12.67]I keep not doing the traps.
[150:26.77]Almost there.
[150:31.58]Kiss from a Rose is the goat cheese of music, while Bangarang is the kefir of music.
[150:37.01]Those are both good things, so... Um... I don't like goat cheese, but why did I just say that?
[150:44.58]I hate that stuff.
[150:53.65]How dare you say that?
[150:55.11]Goat cheese is... fucking disgusting, okay?
[151:00.17]Let's be real.
[151:03.04]I don't have enough wood for the fire?
[151:17.52]Hold on.
[151:18.26]We gotta get the fire going.
[151:22.81]Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.
[151:26.64]Da-da-da.
[151:28.86]You played the candy version of this?
[151:30.28]I don't think there is a candy version.
[151:32.72]I think you're being funny.
[151:43.21]Whisk scales.
[151:59.30]We're almost there.
[152:01.30]And then we can get a big water tank and it's going to be.
[152:05.09]Piped up like crazy.
[152:15.29]Alright, I'm it's not another.
[152:16.31]I've been true for 5 hours.
[152:21.30]Oh my God, OK well.
[152:27.58]I'm gonna eat another pretzel.
[152:30.06]And I'm gonna get up and move around.
[152:33.25]I'll be right back.
[152:37.54]Make sure, hey, make sure I don't die.
[152:39.40]Make sure I don't die.
[152:40.30]Hey, move my character around every few minutes so I don't die.
[152:43.38]And I don't get, like, DC'd.
[152:45.41]I'll be back.
[157:29.42]Okay.
[157:36.44]Did I make some stuff?
[157:37.38]Yeah.
[157:39.54]Here comes an annoying noise.
[157:40.54]I'm sorry.
[157:42.51]What?
[157:44.05]Oh, okay.
[157:58.99]I'm like coughing and farting at the same time.
[158:01.07]I'm trying to make it so you don't hear it.
[158:21.36]What the fuck?
[158:22.04]Come on, let's go!
[158:25.14]Come on, I need this.
[158:29.89]Yes!
[158:34.49]Where is it?
[158:37.82]Okay, water tank.
[158:40.66]Hell yeah.
[158:41.34]60 water, that's insane.
[158:53.81]I'm maxed out on meat right now.
[159:04.40]Oh no, I want geared meat.
[159:08.22]Let me do this too.
[159:10.65]I think I'm probably almost close to being maxed out on huts.
[159:13.76]Yeah, I am.
[159:14.32]Now we're maxed out on pretty much... I think there's one or two more things to get.
[159:18.87]Whoa, my eyes.
[159:19.97]Do you have a goal in this game?
[159:23.54]Um, to win.
[159:35.75]Alright.
[159:37.17]I've got my new tank.
[159:39.56]I'm going to take 20 meat.
[159:41.36]I'm going to take... The what?
[159:44.74]Do I have it?
[159:49.73]Damn it.
[159:51.89]I'll buy the map.
[159:56.32]Wait, I want... Yeah, I want to bring batteries.
[160:00.11]Because I want the laser to be good.
[160:04.51]10 scales, 10 teeth.
[160:06.87]Oh boy, here we go again.
[160:15.80]OK, that's good enough.
[160:23.28]Steel sword.
[160:27.84]Uh, make some torches.
[160:32.82]Okay.
[160:40.95]I'm going right.
[160:50.53]Yay!
[160:50.87]Coal mine.
[160:51.75]Finally.
[160:52.25]I just lasered that guy.
[161:14.54]I don't want to use too much of this, though, because these guys aren't that bad.
[161:19.26]That guy was.
[161:20.54]Only the chief remains.
[161:22.57]Alright, I should have claimed this now.
[161:25.49]Camp is still safe.
[161:26.87]With the crackling of the fires, the mine is now safe.
[161:31.12]Alright, thank god.
[161:36.20]I just want to turn around and go back.
[161:39.55]Please play Dracula 4?
[161:42.81]Um...
[161:45.55]Okay, is it like a bad TV show that turns into a good TV show?
[161:54.54]Because Dracula 3 was a bad TV show.
[162:12.91]You?
[162:13.79]Okay.
[162:15.23]I'll do the town.
[162:25.61]And I have to make it back with this coal alive or it will be bad.
[162:36.45]The large gymnasium doors, footsteps.
[162:38.47]Okay.
[162:39.29]Yep.
[162:47.20]Give me the meat.
[162:51.80]And give me the meat.
[162:57.51]And give me the coal.
[163:02.27]Shit.
[163:11.24]I got too much stuff, man.
[163:12.19]I need a bigger pack.
[163:16.83]Dracula 4 Shadow of the Dragon received very little attention in the mainstream gaming press, with limited coverage from professional critics.
[163:23.26]And what reviews it did receive were negative.
[163:25.33]Critics were especially disparaging about the length of the game, the linearity of the gameplay, and the implementation of the health system.
[163:32.94]Okay, now go read me Dracula 2's review.
[163:36.03]Uh, consensus.
[163:54.29]Alright.
[163:57.22]Can I do anything with the coal now?
[164:00.16]She warns of greed of reaching too far.
[164:03.01]Tears in her eyes.
[164:03.85]She says to stop venturing out.
[164:14.20]There we go.
[164:15.02]Okay.
[164:15.82]Now we're cooking.
[164:18.15]Now we're cooking for real.
[164:20.99]So...
[164:23.01]We need cured meat to make coal.
[164:28.38]Okay.
[164:36.71]Chad is bullying the chat GPT chatter.
[164:48.17]The chat GPT chatter.
[164:52.06]Oh, uh, Lububu Dubai Chocolate Chat GPT Chatter.
[164:59.14]Alright.
[165:00.58]I got so much iron.
[165:04.41]We need a bunch of meat too though.
[165:06.67]I have so much meat.
[165:16.88]This will last a long time.
[165:23.65]Okay.
[165:27.03]I have a ton of iron already.
[165:29.39]I do need a bunch more coal, though.
[165:31.51]Do we need tons of cured meat?
[165:33.76]And tons of... Okay.
[165:35.98]That should do it for a little while.
[165:40.26]Honestly, I don't want to use the cured meat here.
[165:44.85]Just get more coal and steel.
[165:48.15]Because I have so much meat.
[165:53.68]Now we just wait around.
[166:06.36]We're going to end up with huge pack, a ton of armor.
[166:13.89]And I'll be good to go.
[166:17.13]Yeah, I'm going back to the military place after this once I get the upgrades.
[166:27.69]Alright, steel is piping in.
[166:29.63]Convoy is a thousand wood.
[166:38.72]I got leather, right?
[166:41.33]Yep.
[166:42.11]Alright, there we go.
[166:43.03]I need a bunch of wood.
[166:46.14]I got all the iron and I got all the steel I need.
[166:50.36]Just need a ton of wood so I have people start cutting.
[166:55.65]Have people start chopping down some trees.
[167:07.65]Did you play this game for five hours?
[167:09.23]I did not.
[167:10.71]Played Monster Rancher for two?
[167:13.47]Two and a half?
[167:15.84]I've been playing this for like two and a half hours.
[167:17.70]Just about three.
[167:21.73]Old Wanderer here.
[167:23.47]I never have enough to give this guy.
[167:29.28]What is using the wood?
[167:30.98]Oh shit.
[167:40.07]Last time you rode a bike.
[167:42.91]It's been probably 25 years.
[167:56.62]Braid the meat for the cured meat.
[168:01.81]Oh, you are a smart one.
[168:05.44]Turn your volume down for a few minutes.
[168:24.77]It's like I'm being fucking attacked.
[168:35.75]That's not even... What a terrible return that is.
[168:40.70]That's not worth doing.
[168:41.68]I just lost... And my game just crashed!
[168:46.81]You just crashed my game, dude!
[168:48.47]When did it save?
[168:52.24]Why did you tell me to do that?
[168:55.04]Why am I blaming you for that?
[168:56.68]It is your fault, though.
[169:05.69]we good looks fine did I lose anything no nope we're good my game just crashed why am I doing like the YouTuber voice today I feel like I'm doing it a lot lately
[169:34.71]I'm so hooked on the stream that I just shat myself from avoiding the bathroom so I can watch more.
[169:44.85]That is the most outrageous image that I've just put in my head now.
[169:52.24]I just imagine somebody just sitting there just not going to the bathroom.
[169:55.50]It's like, especially to this game.
[169:58.75]I can assure you if you go to the bathroom and you come back, these numbers on the right will be a little different.
[170:06.50]Not much is going to change.
[170:11.47]You're not going to miss a whole lot in 10 to 20 minutes.
[170:14.69]We're just chilling.
[170:17.17]You don't have to hold going to the bathroom.
[170:21.32]What the fuck?
[170:21.94]That's messed up.
[170:23.60]Alright, I'm going to move on from that one.
[170:28.87]OK, now I have a ton of room.
[170:33.25]I'm ready to go fight.
[170:41.00]What do I got?
[170:45.08]Batteries.
[170:47.29]I need batteries.
[170:51.99]Steel sword.
[170:53.35]I need batteries if this is going to work out.
[170:58.56]I need to have meat.
[171:08.08]Alright, everybody chill.
[171:08.94]I got plenty of steel.
[171:13.72]Just cut wood, I need it.
[171:18.67]I need meat too though.
[171:27.59]Give me some cured meat.
[171:38.86]That's good.
[171:39.38]I'll take like 15.
[171:40.14]20 is safe.
[171:42.83]No.
[171:44.13]I have a huge backpack now, don't I?
[171:49.92]I'll take like 40.
[171:53.52]I'm at work hiding in the bathroom.
[171:56.87]Don't get in trouble.
[172:00.54]Okay, here we go.
[172:01.76]Buy scales, buy bait.
[172:04.82]Buy bait.
[172:06.84]I don't even know what that even means.
[172:07.94]Why am I buying that?
[172:11.71]Oh shit, that was a lot.
[172:15.47]Strange scales?
[172:17.59]Is that different than regular scales?
[172:24.70]Alright, here we go.
[172:26.86]Time.
[172:29.47]It's time to go to that place.
[172:32.03]After I buy ten more batteries.
[172:37.99]I need a bunch of teeth.
[172:41.56]Oh boy.
[172:42.06]I wish there was a by 10.
[172:52.12]They might be and I'm just not doing it.
[173:08.67]Okay.
[173:09.31]I've got 18 shots on the laser.
[173:11.91]Got a ton of stuff.
[173:13.52]Go over here.
[173:22.89]How much HP do I have?
[173:23.91]I didn't even see it.
[173:25.03]I have new armor.
[173:36.81]I only have five meat?
[173:41.68]Alright, here we go.
[173:51.61]Don't mess with that, I need to hit those.
[174:01.63]Oh, he's got a rifle.
[174:03.05]Do you have bullets?
[174:06.70]You piece of shit.
[174:16.19]Okay, one more.
[174:21.83]This guy had bullets?
[174:23.72]Alright, I'm just spamming at this guy.
[174:33.03]Yes!
[174:34.89]He had a katana!
[174:38.78]Hehehehe!
[174:45.63]The military presence has been cleared.
[174:47.04]The mine is now safe.
[174:50.12]Sulfur.
[174:50.60]I gotta get out of here now.
[174:56.19]Time to go.
[174:56.71]I ain't losing the katana.
[175:07.56]Nope.
[175:08.99]An armory can be made.
[175:10.29]We'll force her to build it.
[175:13.55]I'm kind of a terrible person, aren't I?
[175:24.02]They all stare sadly back, blackened faces from the soot.
[175:28.59]She whispers, murderer, with an earshot.
[175:31.97]I saw an armory out there.
[175:33.20]We'll force her to build one.
[175:39.43]Oh my goodness.
[175:40.95]The armory.
[175:43.05]800 wood, 100 steel, 50 sulfur.
[175:49.32]Don't you have, yeah, apparently I've got 80 slaves.
[175:51.82]That's not good.
[175:54.65]Yeah, that's bad.
[175:58.88]Alright.
[176:00.08]I need... How much sulfur do I have?
[176:01.93]I need sulfur.
[176:03.57]Sulfur is meat.
[176:05.87]So we need to make cured meat.
[176:09.66]I've got a bunch of meat.
[176:10.48]Why did I do all that bullshit?
[176:12.11]Why did I dump 5,000 meat into the trash?
[176:25.33]We'll stop the bleeding on this a little.
[176:27.51]Because this takes a lot of meat to make 10 cured meat.
[176:31.14]Let's get the steel moving.
[176:32.64]Actually, no, no, no.
[176:33.20]We don't need steel.
[176:35.47]What do I need?
[176:38.53]Wood.
[176:39.73]Steel.
[176:40.65]Actually, okay.
[176:41.29]I'm ready.
[176:42.78]Armory.
[176:44.30]Dark age sets in, she says.
[176:46.72]The armory is done.
[176:52.85]War mantle?
[176:53.53]War mantle?
[176:56.68]Okay.
[176:58.29]I can make rifles now.
[177:02.78]How much alien alloy do I have?
[177:04.10]I need one more alien alloy.
[177:09.05]61% of you have neglected going to the bathroom to watch this stream.
[177:13.03]Can't you just take your phone into the bathroom?
[177:19.59]I don't understand this.
[177:29.35]Twitch Mobile sucks though, so you'd rather hold a shit in than use Twitch Mobile?
[177:35.16]Oh my goodness, what a negative review that is.
[177:38.55]That's the worst review I've ever heard in my life.
[177:48.29]Unironically, yes.
[177:51.41]What?
[177:52.71]It's that bad?
[177:59.73]I just see on the app store the one star review.
[178:04.92]It's just like, holy shit, dude.
[178:07.56]Okay.
[178:08.57]I have a rifle.
[178:09.29]I just need bullets.
[178:10.99]I can almost make the war mantle.
[178:13.09]One more alien alloy.
[178:14.60]One alien alloy is what?
[178:17.08]Fur 3000?
[178:17.72]Scale 75.
[178:20.19]Alright, I need a bunch of fur.
[178:22.39]Let's get the mantle.
[178:27.34]So we need a bunch of fur.
[178:29.24]Let's get everybody on it.
[178:30.06]350 fur every five seconds.
[178:53.32]This won't take long.
[179:04.80]This is using fur?
[179:06.14]Oh, fuck.
[179:09.21]I should have to click this 60 times.
[179:24.27]This sounds like the audio from a mobile game ad.
[179:29.59]No!
[179:30.09]No!
[179:30.59]Run!
[179:31.49]Oh!
[179:32.12]I hit you in the head like 10 times.
[179:35.90]I gotta build!
[179:36.54]Build!
[179:37.86]Level up!
[179:38.18]Level up!
[179:42.77]Press and hold it?
[179:44.35]I don't think that works.
[179:46.21]No, it doesn't.
[179:55.13]Can you stream till 2am?
[179:57.59]I think I'm probably close to the end of the game.
[180:00.07]And that would be the end of the stream.
[180:01.74]But I will finish this tonight.
[180:04.74]I think we're getting pretty close.
[180:09.55]Uh-oh.
[180:11.75]A gunshot rings through the trees.
[180:13.41]Well-armed men charge out of the forest, firing into the crowd.
[180:17.60]After a skirmish, they are driven away, but not without losses.
[180:20.38]Oh my god, almost everybody died.
[180:22.60]Half of the entire place died.
[180:27.39]Did they get replaced?
[180:29.35]Eventually?
[180:29.83]That's not good.
[180:36.60]Holy shit.
[180:42.79]I need more houses now.
[180:45.76]I think they just fill over time as long as you have stuff to do, I think.
[180:57.29]OK, I've got 1000 fur.
[180:58.93]3000 fur.
[181:08.47]Scales.
[181:12.05]I'm going to turn this down.
[181:21.25]Okay, 75 skills is done.
[181:23.19]And now I need... Fuck, I lost so many people.
[181:35.49]That's why that went... I was like, why am I not getting more of this?
[181:48.52]I don't know.
[181:49.08]What does this even do?
[181:51.44]War mantle?
[181:53.65]What's Otto doing right now?
[181:54.91]He is laying down and he's licking his paw.
[182:00.13]Now he saw that I said his name and I was looking at me.
[182:04.36]He's now staring at me now.
[182:07.70]Being a good dachshund.
[182:10.80]Hello, good dachshund.
[182:14.59]Hello, good dachshund.
[182:19.55]Criminal that is not an auto cam.
[182:23.08]Alright, I'll do an auto cam for you guys soon.
[182:27.33]While he just kind of chills on the couch, I'll do it for like half an hour.
[182:32.21]I'll do a dog cam.
[182:34.88]Auto cam.
[182:38.91]At 640.
[182:39.85]I'm going to turn it down so I can spam again.
[182:51.89]Favorite Skittles is... Probably the red one.
[183:07.88]Teeth.
[183:08.44]I need 30 teeth.
[183:13.75]Almost done.
[183:14.23]Now we just have to let people bring fur.
[183:18.72]And I can get the fifth alloy...
[183:21.67]And that's the last upgrade, I think.
[183:23.89]I don't think there's anything else I can do.
[183:26.04]Then we have to just go do whatever we need to do.
[183:42.13]There we go.
[183:42.83]Okay, now I can... This will go much faster, though.
[183:51.34]Can a monster die mid-tournament?
[183:54.46]Um, I don't know.
[183:55.44]I don't think so.
[184:05.62]Alright, now we just need 3,000 of this and we're good to go.
[184:21.21]Yeah, we're going to do three brackets, and I said it before, but we can go over it again.
[184:29.56]So everyone's going to pick a monster that they want to put into the bracket, and no one knows who is in it, what monster is in it, until we get into the tournament.
[184:39.18]So let's say poke, I'm going against poke.
[184:42.26]I won't know what his monster is until he decides what it is.
[184:45.88]And we all have to decide what our monsters are.
[184:49.17]We lock them in.
[184:50.07]And then that's what we're doing for that round robin.
[184:54.59]So when we reveal the monsters, you can't be like, oh, well, hold on.
[184:59.36]Let me go back.
[184:59.78]I'm going to change my monster.
[185:00.76]Nope.
[185:01.24]You just have to pick who you want.
[185:02.98]That's why I'm trying to figure out who I want to go first.
[185:09.05]We're going to do it's round robin, so it's not single limb or double limb.
[185:14.38]We're going to do it just like they do in the game itself.
[185:19.68]Almost there.
[185:25.85]And if there's time after doing three of those, then there might need to be a tiebreaker.
[185:31.92]So let's say, I'm not going to say this is going to happen, but let's just, okay, whatever.
[185:35.72]Let's say I win the first bracket.
[185:38.95]And then Poke wins the second bracket.
[185:42.41]And then, you know, Criken wins the third bracket, right?
[185:47.65]Then the three of us can do like a single elimination, maybe like Pokémon style, if people still want to do it.
[185:56.65]And, um... Decide, kind of do like another blind pick.
[186:03.54]With the three of us.
[186:08.68]Until we get a winner.
[186:12.33]If there's only time to do the three brackets, then that would be fun too.
[186:17.73]Alright, here we go.
[186:19.08]Three thousand.
[186:21.30]I need one more of these alien alloys.
[186:26.04]Okay.
[186:30.84]War Mantle.
[186:32.48]A warrior once more.
[186:38.69]What does that do?
[186:47.42]What does that do?
[186:52.56]Hey dude, are you the guy that ordered the switch off of DoorDash?
[186:57.37]Uh, that...
[187:04.03]That's funny because... Hold on, wait.
[187:09.38]I can't ever help this guy.
[187:12.48]Yeah, it was Poke and it was a PS5 Pro.
[187:16.62]So it's funny how we're losing that through telephone.
[187:19.49]That's funny.
[187:21.79]Okay, so what did that do for me?
[187:26.65]Alright, let's go out.
[187:27.80]I got meat.
[187:28.46]I got plenty of batteries.
[187:29.96]I got a laser.
[187:33.67]I'm going down.
[187:42.46]This Katana is crazy.
[187:45.16]At 80 health now.
[187:49.18]Going down.
[187:50.84]Lay out this town.
[187:53.35]All suburb torch.
[188:01.58]Give me the bullets.
[188:10.55]That guy was fast.
[188:22.29]Okay.
[188:24.96]Good.
[188:25.08]I'm going to take a lot of the meat.
[188:26.20]I feel like I need it bad.
[188:29.82]Okay, so now this is a replenish.
[188:35.15]I'm at the edge of the map.
[188:48.19]Alright, don't get too crazy here.
[188:59.14]Alright, I need to be... Make sure I have 30 steps.
[189:05.61]Ooh, what's this?
[189:07.26]Another ruined city?
[189:09.50]Alright, be careful here because these guys killed me pretty bad before.
[189:21.70]I'm not that confident that I can do this.
[189:25.95]Maybe I am now.
[189:29.55]More voices can be heard ahead?
[189:39.25]Shit.
[189:40.49]It's going to be tough.
[189:41.85]I don't know.
[189:49.71]That was kind of dog shit.
[189:50.63]That was dog shit.
[189:53.80]Okay.
[189:56.86]Give me the replenish.
[190:05.40]Soldier?
[190:06.06]Oh shit.
[190:15.19]Ugh.
[190:17.72]take the bullets good I'm just gonna stay around the edge I think more oh kill them Jesus they do a lot of damage I got 50 water make sure I don't get trapped out here
[190:49.97]I don't want to lose the katana.
[190:55.18]Okay.
[190:55.54]I'm going to say up.
[191:06.77]Oh, okay.
[191:09.67]B. Big borehole.
[191:15.00]Alien alloy.
[191:16.30]I already used it.
[191:20.79]Fuck not good.
[191:32.60]Drop something man.
[191:36.16]I gotta go.
[191:48.06]Drop something better than this shit.
[191:58.97]Okay, I got refill.
[192:04.64]Whoa!
[192:06.96]What is that, W?
[192:07.76]That's new.
[192:13.81]I'm scared to do it.
[192:17.31]A crashed ship.
[192:19.59]Familiar curves of a wanderer vessel rise up out of the dust and ash.
[192:22.96]Lucky that the natives can't work with the mechanisms.
[192:25.74]With a little effort, it might fly again.
[192:30.53]Did I just get a ship?
[192:33.98]I have to get out of here.
[192:36.42]I gotta go home right now.
[192:47.18]I gotta make it.
[192:47.70]I only have 14 food.
[192:48.72]Am I gonna make it there?
[193:00.58]Yeah, I got it.
[193:02.09]Yeah.
[193:04.03]I just got a ship.
[193:04.51]I got a ship.
[193:05.35]I got a ship.
[193:08.95]A wanderer starship.
[193:12.70]Okay.
[193:14.14]Upgrade hull?
[193:15.38]Zero HP?
[193:17.56]Wait.
[193:18.41]Upgrade thrusters.
[193:21.55]Okay, I just used alien alloy.
[193:30.79]Okay.
[193:32.77]What's my opinion on BLTs?
[193:34.27]I love them.
[193:36.92]I love a BLT, but I'll never order a BLT.
[193:40.72]And it's good, that's fine, because a BLT that you make at home is way better than the one you get at a restaurant.
[193:46.37]Do you guys notice this?
[193:47.97]Have you noticed that the BLT is one of the most lackluster, lazy sandwiches if you order it from a restaurant, when it should be the top-of-the-line way to get that?
[194:04.34]I've made a BLT at home, and unlike any other sandwich, I think, in history of the world, only when I make a BLT do I genuinely... It's like I'm a five-star chef in the kitchen.
[194:18.45]That bread, I take the knife, make sure the top of that... First of all, it's a nice, thick country white bread.
[194:24.96]and then you toast it get that nice and toasted and you do the thing with the knife on the top where it's perfectly crusty perfectly crunchy but soft underneath that a nice nice layer of mayo get that bacon cooked up crispy really crispy none of that no chewy bacon dog in a blt get out of here that tomato needs to be nice cut thick
[194:51.55]No thin tomato.
[194:53.32]A thick, one thick tomato slice.
[194:56.86]Not too thick where it's gross.
[194:59.14]And then the crispiest, wet, sopping, delicious, crunchy iceberg lettuce piled on top of that.
[195:13.32]Liftoff.
[195:13.80]I can leave?
[195:15.89]I'm not leaving with that.
[195:17.99]That's not strong enough.
[195:20.63]Sopping is a bad word.
[195:22.11]What I meant to say was kind of slightly wet.
[195:25.98]Wet as in when you bite into it, you get that flavor.
[195:28.13]You get that watery kind of flavor.
[195:30.48]Not soggy.
[195:31.16]No, not if you're eating my BLT.
[195:35.11]She screams at the sight of the ship.
[195:37.91]She says so much death has been brought to this world.
[195:41.16]She says history has repeated itself just like with him.
[195:44.56]The jeweled locket around her neck begins to glow.
[195:47.67]With a distraught look, a look of hatred, she vanishes into nothingness.
[195:54.72]Her jeweled locket left behind.
[195:58.58]I got six jewels.
[196:03.93]The flames flicker and dissipate mournfully.
[196:08.64]Oh, I can't build anything anymore.
[196:25.31]Oh, shit.
[196:25.69]I can't even... I can't have... I can't light the fire anymore.
[196:31.58]Oh, no.
[196:33.80]I got 5,000 wood.
[196:35.62]What do you mean I can't light the fire?
[196:40.09]Oh shit, we gotta be in darkness.
[196:43.49]Okay.
[196:45.15]Well, let's make some alien metal and get the fuck off this goddamn planet.
[196:57.66]Okay, I need a bunch of scales and teeth.
[197:02.57]Okay.
[197:04.61]Lower the volume for a second, everybody.
[197:07.10]Alright, I'll just do it.
[197:08.00]Here.
[197:08.46]I saved you.
[197:29.14]Okay.
[197:34.25]Ugh.
[197:36.31]75 scales, ugh.
[197:39.85]God.
[197:55.61]Ugh.
[197:56.47]Shift-click?
[198:01.71]How much is that doing?
[198:07.05]J or click?
[198:08.53]What do you mean J?
[198:11.42]J?
[198:24.19]No, that's not doing it.
[198:27.33]J is another way to click.
[198:35.06]Okay.
[198:40.08]I can make like five of these now.
[198:42.84]Now I need a shitload of fur.
[198:46.54]They're already all on it.
[198:47.55]We're on it.
[198:48.29]We're all doing it.
[198:54.88]Oh, I can get a katana.
[198:56.46]Don't even need it.
[198:57.24]I'm about to fly out of here.
[199:00.16]I think that's what I needed to find.
[199:11.18]Go find some more boreholes.
[199:13.62]I guess I could, right?
[199:17.48]Yeah, I'll go look for some more boreholes.
[199:20.91]In the meantime.
[199:21.51]This is fine.
[199:25.31]I'm looking for B. I'll go up.
[199:36.55]No, I don't want to go in there.
[199:52.00]Yeah, the further out you go, the more... Oh shit, hold on.
[199:56.32]I might die here.
[199:59.91]Oh fuck, I have no food.
[200:01.61]I'm dead.
[200:03.86]My katana!
[200:04.56]I'm gonna lose my katana!
[200:06.88]Okay, go in the city and go in.
[200:21.83]good oh hell yeah okay I gotta stay alive now b for Brian butchug uh his name is Brian chug actually shit uh I'm dead
[200:48.73]Oh, no, I am not.
[200:50.78]Hell yeah.
[200:52.32]We're good.
[200:52.88]Alright.
[200:54.59]I need to get to... Let's go to O, right?
[201:00.34]I can get some stuff from O, can't I?
[201:22.89]Kind of dying here.
[201:23.71]There we go.
[201:35.46]Okay, I'm safe again.
[201:40.10]I don't even need it.
[201:41.06]I'll take this though.
[201:46.33]Okay.
[201:48.01]I'm going to go in here as well because I want all this.
[201:51.99]Alright, look at B.
[201:54.04]B is an O. Come on, let me kill him before he hits me again.
[202:03.59]There we go.
[202:19.65]Good.
[202:23.84]I need to turn around in a minute here.
[202:27.40]There's an H. Bro, Criken's monster is OP.
[202:39.26]You have no chance.
[202:40.00]You know, I keep hearing that, but you know, I'm... You don't know Monster Rancher very well, do you?
[202:48.30]I have confidence in my team.
[203:04.81]Okay, borehole.
[203:06.73]Boom.
[203:12.02]Three alien metals now.
[203:16.47]What is F?
[203:19.27]Did I go into the F?
[203:23.78]Okay, almost fucking killed me.
[203:26.54]What was F?
[203:33.50]Forgotten Battlefield.
[203:35.48]Oh, okay.
[203:36.60]Oh, hell yeah.
[203:40.31]I'm running out of water.
[203:41.13]I think it's time to head back.
[203:51.24]It is.
[203:51.84]Let's go like this.
[203:56.48]Oops.
[204:00.65]No, I got to go to that P right there.
[204:04.24]Locket has a cold glow?
[204:13.80]Wait.
[204:18.79]Oh, okay.
[204:19.59]I need to find something else.
[204:21.23]Dark.
[204:23.59]Cold glow.
[204:28.10]I think I have to find something else here.
[204:31.23]Is it going to say like hot, cold, hot?
[204:33.17]It just said warmer a second ago over here.
[204:35.19]Warm glow.
[204:39.96]Cold glow.
[204:41.66]Warm glow?
[204:45.58]What is it trying to tell me?
[204:50.49]I think you use it to find the alien materials.
[204:54.55]Oh, okay.
[204:57.02]Well, I got a lot, so I'm going to head back now.
[205:04.67]Okay, I can do HP.
[205:08.18]Let's spread it out.
[205:13.53]I can make a couple of them now.
[205:25.08]What should I get these to?
[205:25.78]10?
[205:25.86]10 each?
[205:44.63]Taking a laser, taking a rifle.
[205:46.26]I got plenty of bullets.
[205:47.02]Katana, steel.
[205:49.72]Alright, I'm going again.
[205:53.67]Okay.
[205:55.09]Looking for B. Warmer.
[205:58.69]Warm glow.
[206:02.88]Warmer.
[206:09.19]Bright.
[206:09.83]Oh, shit.
[206:10.41]Okay.
[206:10.71]Okay.

[207:31.83]Okay, I gotta be careful with the water.
[207:36.88]There's nothing out here, so I gotta go back.
[207:40.22]I could head this way.
[207:43.11]Or should I just roll the dice and go up?

[210:21.94]I'm going to do this.
[210:29.43]Okay.

[210:34.92]Maybe I should just keep going up.
[210:41.03]These guys are awful.
[210:41.95]I'm going to kill them quick.
[210:58.29]Those guys are terrible.
[211:02.03]Still dark, really?
[211:07.54]Are you serious?
[211:08.10]There's nothing over here.
[211:17.61]Alright, I have to watch my water.
[211:21.24]Oh nice.
[211:35.99]I used to be so scared of these guys.
[211:49.03]Watch that water.

[211:50.39]This so much of it over here.
[212:01.79]Still dark.
[212:04.33]Still dark.
[212:09.67]Did I not get that one?
[212:11.41]Alright, I'm going back for a sec.
[212:14.80]I'm going to take my last break of the night.
[212:17.58]And then we're going to get to the end of this game.
[212:26.57]Okay.

[212:38.07]um I will be able to good and alright I'll be back last break of the night then we'll finish the game I will see you guys in about two and a half minutes three minutes see you in a second
[217:20.15]Why do they keep doing this to me?
[217:22.14]I take a step away and the guy shows up looking for... fur.
[217:27.50]I need my fur.
[217:29.84]Didn't I?
[217:32.42]I need it.
[217:38.91]Uh, can I afford?
[217:39.65]I can't.
[217:43.86]Alright, I gotta go find some more alien alloys.
[217:51.90]And.
[217:55.86]I'm just going to look for it, I'm good.
[217:58.30]So there's a couple over here.
[218:10.97]OK, yep.
[218:18.70]Three in this one.
[218:20.44]What a haul.
[218:25.71]Oh, yep.
[218:34.48]OK, I I need meat.
[218:35.45]I need to go down here.
[218:40.43]Let's do that first.
[218:52.05]Good.
[218:57.73]You're going to go to a furry convention incognito one day?
[219:00.91]Thought about it.
[219:03.25]I would laugh out loud for a minute or two.
[219:08.38]That guy almost killed me.
[219:15.19]Okay, I've got... I got a lot.
[219:17.09]I got to be careful.
[219:17.77]I don't want to die out here.
[219:18.99]So this is cold now.
[219:21.48]I'm going back.
[219:22.36]I'm a coward.
[219:23.00]I don't care.
[219:36.62]It's a coward move.
[219:37.30]It's fine.
[219:43.29]Alright.
[219:43.51]10 power, 15 HP.
[219:46.99]Is there any more?
[219:51.68]I think I can buy another one of those.
[219:52.94]I need scales, though.
[219:58.10]Scales.
[220:02.47]You probably go as Grimace.
[220:06.31]Is Grimace a furry?
[220:07.55]Grimace isn't an animal.
[220:13.85]I'm going to turn this down for you.
[220:30.81]Uh, Grimace, what is Grimace?
[220:35.50]It's a purple man.
[220:36.66]I actually don't like thinking that it's a man.
[220:39.68]It's like a purple person.
[220:41.27]I don't like that.
[220:44.31]Oh, that's right.
[220:44.71]He's a taste bud.
[220:45.39]We went over this already like two or three years ago.
[220:54.16]He's a milkshake.
[220:57.83]No, he's a purple taste bud.
[221:03.40]Just waiting to buy this one.
[221:07.87]And then I think I'm gonna do one more expedition or two more to the top left and the top bottom right.
[221:17.63]And then I think I'm just gonna take off.
[221:19.28]I'm just gonna do liftoff.
[221:26.48]What should I prioritize?
[221:28.36]Health or thrusters?
[221:35.71]Just do 50-50?
[221:45.26]This is a spreadsheet game.
[221:46.54]Yeah, it's a good one too.
[221:49.70]Okay.
[221:55.09]All I care about is the... Alright, we're going over here.
[222:09.26]Okay, this is getting warm.
[222:14.75]Good.
[222:19.21]I gotta care go to F. The battlefield has so much good shit.
[222:33.74]OK, hold on 20 water.
[222:38.46]Buck not good.
[222:44.97]Actually not good at all.
[222:49.13]Um.
[222:55.48]I need to go.
[222:55.96]I need to get water.
[223:01.97]Does this have water in it?
[223:04.79]No, I don't think so, does it?
[223:08.02]Am I in trouble?
[223:14.61]Does it have water?
[223:23.37]Oh fuck, I'm gonna die!
[223:40.33]Come on, don't die, don't die.
[223:41.95]I might be in trouble if there's one more guy in here, right?
[223:49.00]Oh, thank god.
[223:50.70]Thank god.
[223:52.75]That's so good.
[223:53.79]Okay.
[223:55.24]Now I'm going to go F. No, I'm not.
[224:00.99]I'm going to check this way.
[224:09.42]It's dark over here.
[224:10.43]No, go back.
[224:30.33]OK, give me all the yak grenades.
[224:34.68]Batteries, oh yeah.
[224:38.66]Now I can actually shoot the laser again.
[224:43.04]OK, there's an F right there.
[224:46.09]I'm going to go to it.
[224:48.07]I'm going to go to this Y to refill.
[224:53.71]I got a ton of damage now.
[224:57.18]So we should be good.
[225:08.03]How's my forehead doing?
[225:09.39]Oh, it's fine.
[225:12.92]How's your forehead doing?
[225:32.80]Okay, I'm going to have like 10 more of these.
[225:37.41]I think we're good.
[225:38.47]I've got so much ammo.
[225:42.64]I've got... Is there any other Fs?
[225:46.15]I don't think so.
[225:46.85]Unless it's like down there.
[225:47.98]I'll cut across here.
[226:08.34]It's still dark.
[226:09.98]Dark.
[226:12.57]What is M again?
[226:19.38]What is M?
[226:29.63]Wait, that's ship, right?
[226:32.28]Is there a bunch of ship parts over there?
[226:35.30]Oh, hell yeah.
[226:36.76]I think so.
[226:38.87]I think so too.
[226:43.39]A murky swamp.
[226:44.58]Rotting reeds rise out of the swampy Earth.
[226:48.68]A lone frog sits on the muck silently.
[226:54.21]Deep in the swamp is a moss-covered cabin.
[226:56.17]An old wanderer sits inside in a seeming trance.
[226:58.63]Talk is one jewel to talk.
[227:04.16]I'm bringing a jewel up to that guy.
[227:19.08]I don't, I don't think there's any more of those, uh, alloys.
[227:32.07]Alright, let's head back.
[227:47.14]Do my upgrades.
[227:48.43]Go talk to that guy.
[227:49.41]I'm going to bring a couple of jewels because it's going to be dumb.
[227:54.07]He's going to be like, oh, I'll say some more if you give me another jewel.
[227:56.47]Okay.
[228:03.82]18, 15.
[228:04.40]Alright, everybody.
[228:10.15]Close your ears for a few minutes.
[228:17.77]I'm gonna say 20 and 20.
[228:19.30]I don't be happy with it.
[228:30.42]Does that make sense?
[228:42.78]If I can even get there, I might not be.
[228:44.41]As long as I have 20 health, I'll be happy.
[228:46.57]Alright.
[228:47.95]I need jewel.
[228:50.66]I'm just going to bring five of them because who knows?
[228:52.68]I'm going to have to do this like a bunch of times.
[228:56.43]Got plenty of food.
[228:58.10]I got plenty of food.
[229:00.20]Let's get out there.
[229:01.44]Going back up there.
[229:15.01]Shit, I thought I timed it right.
[229:30.31]OK, here we go.
[229:31.99]Talk.
[229:33.20]What the hell?
[229:35.45]He didn't even give me anything!
[230:12.89]I think it's time to take off.
[230:16.32]I could... Should I just go bottom right?
[230:20.94]All the way bottom right?
[230:22.95]I feel like I haven't been there yet.
[230:30.90]There's plenty of places to rest over here.
[230:42.41]In fact, I'm going to do it now.
[230:46.48]So I don't freak out about it.
[230:55.25]Okay.
[230:56.32]What's down here?
[231:00.12]Did I just miss everything?
[231:16.07]Kill this fucking guy.
[231:17.08]What the hell was that?
[231:19.76]I'm in trouble.
[231:21.15]I'm going to die.
[231:29.41]Oh, thank goodness.
[231:47.07]Okay.
[231:49.02]I don't see anything else over here.
[231:50.10]Maybe all the way top right or all the way top... Can I move this?
[231:55.51]Does he even know that we're here?
[231:56.95]I'm locked in, man.
[232:07.17]I'm gonna go back down.
[232:25.87]Okay.
[232:28.03]I don't think there's anything down here.
[232:29.19]No, nothing in the corner.
[232:42.39]I'm just checking.
[232:48.06]I'm looking for... Is there another guy with a jewel?
[232:49.68]No other jewel guy.
[232:53.36]Just making sure.
[233:02.02]Alright, I'm ready.
[233:02.78]I'm out of here.
[233:04.38]I'm taking off.
[233:08.90]Oh my god, if I don't die from this guy.
[233:15.49]Oh my god, I just re-aggroed him.
[233:24.36]Alright, wish me luck.
[233:26.24]There might be more I could get from this, but...
[233:29.67]Like I could go down here, but I think I'm going to just go for it.
[233:36.72]I have enough to get one more alloy.
[233:46.67]I'll turn this down for you.
[233:50.70]Alright, everybody, here we go.
[233:51.48]20 HP or 16 power.
[233:55.50]What do you think?
[234:13.72]I'm going to do them both.
[234:26.35]I'm going to do two more.
[234:27.10]20 HP, 16 power.
[234:35.93]We just need to wait for the fur, and we're good.
[234:44.60]I do need fur.
[234:45.68]Can I buy it?
[234:47.34]I can't.
[234:47.58]I don't think I can buy fur.
[234:52.23]Everybody's already doing it.
[234:53.27]It's like every single person is doing the fur.
[235:05.42]Any classic Canadian programming you've been watching?
[235:10.37]No, I was on a red green show kick for a while.
[235:22.01]Um, get out of here.
[235:29.78]Red Green is awful.
[235:34.08]It's a cozy show.
[235:37.89]What are you talking about?
[235:39.13]It's a classic Canadian television show, and I'm not even Canadian.
[235:48.22]I just need 6,000 fur.
[236:01.18]I'm good.
[236:04.32]Yeah, I'll get 20 and then 16.
[236:06.25]And then I'm just lifting off.
[236:16.45]I'm not going to run the ads, but I'm going to... I think Otto wants to go outside.
[236:21.94]So I'm just going to sit here for a second.
[236:24.64]I'm going to sit here with BRB.
[236:26.48]I'm not playing any ads or anything.
[236:29.79]I don't need to do that right now.
[236:31.41]Pre-rolls are off.
[236:32.59]And I'm not really going anywhere.
[236:34.84]I'm just going to let him pick him up.
[236:40.37]I'll be kind of BRB.
[236:42.75]I'll be half BRB.
[241:24.22]Okay, I'm back.
[241:31.11]What a dull stream that just was.
[241:33.43]Why are you guys even doing here?
[241:36.88]You guys watch this?
[241:39.64]You guys are watching just a... Is there a streamer here?
[241:44.91]You guys just watch a menu?
[241:52.09]Okay.
[241:53.23]Am I finally gonna get to see what this guy does?
[241:57.32]How do I not have a torch and meat for this guy every time he comes here?
[242:03.63]I only have seven cured meat.
[242:05.65]Oh my god.
[242:09.68]Okay.
[242:11.94]Uh, here we go.
[242:16.93]You guys ready?
[242:20.33]Time to turn the spaceship on.
[242:28.10]I have so much meat.
[242:30.79]Alright, let me make sure that I'm taking snacks with me.
[242:32.95]20 and 16.
[242:39.71]Let me see what I got.
[242:41.30]I've got everything I need.
[242:42.52]I got all the weapons I need.
[242:44.44]But I am going to make sure there's a bunch of meat.
[242:49.58]So let's make... Okay, yes, I know.
[242:57.17]Stop it.
[243:02.83]I have to make sure I have at least 100 meat.
[243:05.26]What if I need it?
[243:19.25]Alright, here we go.
[243:20.51]Liftoff time.
[243:29.58]I'm out.
[243:33.65]What do I do?
[243:34.21]What do I do?
[243:34.59]The sky black taunting.
[243:41.06]Do I pick this stuff up or do I dodge it?
[243:43.92]The air begins to thin, hard to breathe.
[243:46.95]Temperature drops, the ship's windows are cool to the touch.
[243:52.28]The horizon dark, desolate.
[243:54.16]The windows begin to freeze.
[243:56.64]Oh shit.
[244:00.53]Okay, you guys can read that.
[244:01.43]I'm busy.
[244:02.73]I can't... I cannot read this in play.
[244:19.86]Oh my god.
[244:22.04]Oh!
[244:33.86]Ugh!
[244:35.34]Did I do it?
[244:36.72]Through the ice windows, the lonely planet fades into the distance.
[244:39.30]I think I made it.
[244:40.85]Shivering, gasping for air, must find her.
[244:42.71]The locket glows.
[244:43.63]Must find her.
[244:47.70]A dark room.
[244:53.47]Okay.
[244:55.79]So I actually beat it.
[244:59.05]What?
[244:59.27]What?
[245:01.33]Did you have to get the true ending without building huts?
[245:05.15]That sounds horrible.
[245:09.42]I do know.
[245:09.96]I forgot about this until right now.
[245:14.94]If you don't do it... Do you remember the very beginning?
[245:18.89]When he's like, oh, my head hurts.
[245:20.49]Who am I?
[245:20.93]Where am I?
[245:21.39]I think you crash the ship and the whole thing starts all over again.
[245:28.46]The end?
[245:30.26]Yeah.
[245:32.95]Yeah, see?
[245:33.45]Awake, head throbbing, vision blurry, the voices say to survive.
[245:36.30]Um... So, if you don't get all the alloy... And... Uh, you end up crashing the ship.
[245:46.67]And then you wake up and do it again.
[245:50.96]There is a sequel.
[245:52.10]It is not the end.
[245:52.80]The sequel is called The Ensign.
[245:55.70]And it's 90% that kind of exploration fight stuff mode.
[246:03.92]It's more of that than it is of this.
[246:10.46]Does something similar happen if you die while adventuring after the locket lady leaves?
[246:14.09]That actually might be true as well.
[246:17.63]But I hope she's okay.
[246:19.10]I have to keep the fire going.
[246:26.60]Not flashy, but it was really entertaining.
[246:28.60]It's great.
[246:28.94]This is a classic.
[246:29.57]This is a very... I want to say the original browser game is at least 10 years old at this point.
[246:38.51]I love it.
[246:38.99]And if you guys thought this was cool and chill, maybe we'll do the sequel too.
[246:43.48]This is the Steam version.
[246:47.14]There is you can just play them a dark room.
[246:49.60]It's got a browser version, but I think this one was a little more.
[246:54.85]I did he I think he ported it over here.
[246:59.67]And added some stuff made it.
[247:01.12]I think he changed it a little.
[247:02.68]I think he made it a little.
[247:05.86]Less.
[247:07.32]Unforgiving maybe.
[247:10.55]But it was fun.
[247:13.89]Oh, there's a thank you.
[247:16.11]Thank you for letting this humble experience into your life.
[247:18.69]Indie game developers such as myself rely heavily on word-of-mouth recommendations and reviews.
[247:23.70]Hope you enjoy the dev commentary.
[247:26.90]Amir.
[247:27.44]Hey, well, I'm telling you all about it right now.
[247:41.74]Whoa, what is this?
[247:43.85]Hello, hello.
[247:44.93]I'm Amir, the... Whoa, what?
[247:46.50]For now, let's just say I'm here to warn you about spoilers.
[247:50.06]There's a concept in writing, and I'd say by extension all creative works, called the death of the author.
[247:55.59]The term means that a creative work... Can we get the whole dev commentary?
[247:59.25]...of the author, their lives, intent, or the context in which a thing was built.
[248:04.50]I agree with the sentiment.
[248:06.18]Even listening to the soundbite violates the death of the author.
[248:08.78]My apologies for that.
[248:10.70]Anything and everything outside of a dark room, the game, including this developer commentary, shouldn't influence your experience.
[248:16.95]So consider yourself warned.
[248:18.49]If you're not done exploring every nook and cranny of ADR, I strongly recommend you stop at this soundbite and come back when you feel like you're ready to have your interpretation of ADR tainted by what is mentioned hereafter.
[248:29.13]Okay, now we listen to 35, and it's just crazy.
[248:32.27]There's dinosaur sounds.
[248:33.52]He's talking about, like, he's talking about, like, the moon of Jupiter and shit.
[248:42.04]That's so cool.
[248:42.94]I didn't even know that was it.
[248:43.90]I guess you have to, when you beat the game, you unlock this.
[248:46.74]That's cool.
[248:51.95]Yeah, I actually kind of don't want to do that because I don't feel like the sequel has some stuff maybe that's more fun to see it as it comes in.
[249:01.62]That's super cool though.
[249:04.34]A Dark Room.
[249:06.12]Get it on Steam.
[249:07.29]And its sequel, The Ensign.
[249:12.01]It's good stuff.
[249:16.45]But that's it for me.
[249:17.83]I'll see you guys later.
[249:19.96]Thanks for sticking around.
[249:20.88]Thanks for hanging out.
[249:25.32]The next time I'll be live live on Tuesday.
[249:28.33]And it's going to be quite a week.

[249:44.05]We got Monster Rancher tournament on Wednesday, not Monday anymore.
[249:47.84]If you came in the last.
[249:49.78]20-30 minutes or so.
[249:51.76]That's Wednesday.
[249:52.62]Tuesday I'm going to just play something.
[249:56.13]I want to do a few things.
[249:58.09]I got quite a list of stuff to do.
[250:01.36]We also have we're going to be hanging out with the House Flipper devs.
[250:06.31]That's going to be like 30 minutes of a larger stream.
[250:11.46]So I'll do something else and then we'll hang out with them for like half an hour.
[250:15.16]So that's pretty cool.
[250:16.69]I'm excited about that.
[250:18.47]And then there's some sponsor stuff to do.
[250:21.75]So we've got a week coming up here.
[250:23.68]A lot of stuff going on.

[250:37.33]But I'll see you Tuesday.
[250:38.43]We'll do some stuff.
[250:41.76]And that's it.
