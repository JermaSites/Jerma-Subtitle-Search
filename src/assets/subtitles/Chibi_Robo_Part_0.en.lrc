[00:03.51]Viewers dropping is that somebody just wrote in all capitals Yeah, no that I think they're only going up from here oh Shit man viewers dropping Hey, how you doing guys?
[00:31.04]I'm doing pretty good.
[00:32.70]I'm just hanging out.
[00:35.42]My, uh... A little bit of a messed up throat, but who cares?
[00:39.94]We got Chibi-Robo to play.
[00:41.52]It's hard to say this.
[00:43.12]Chibi-Robo.
[00:46.33]I'm gonna be playing this fun game called Chibi-Robo.
[00:53.47]Uh, this was an expensive game.
[00:56.34]Looks pretty cool.
[00:57.82]The GameCube discs.
[00:59.08]I remember them.
[01:00.74]They're very, very cool.
[01:02.08]These are a collector's item at this point.
[01:06.74]It's not in the... Yeah, I'm playing it on a Wii.
[01:10.42]I know.
[01:11.06]Get over it.
[01:13.00]Not the original GameCube.
[01:14.50]That's fine.
[01:19.63]But yeah, I've heard a lot of good things.
[01:21.49]I want to play Chibi-Robo.
[01:23.66]I'm into it.
[01:25.24]I heard you clean, you prepare food, and you use a dustpan and stuff.
[01:32.52]I'm going to love this game.
[01:33.40]How am I not going to like this?
[01:35.60]But let me tweet this out, and we'll start in about two minutes.
[02:36.71]Alright, are you guys ready?
[02:39.19]I haven't done it yet.
[02:40.71]I'm not going to until we're ready.
[02:45.49]You know what the best part of the Wii is?
[02:48.03]The fact that you can insert a GameCube disc at the top of the tray, or at the bottom of the tray, and it still figures out where it is.
[02:56.88]Now that's some real technology.
[02:58.44]Alright, let's go.
[03:05.83]Are you ready?
[03:07.33]It's going in.
[03:09.88]Should I show the disc first?
[03:12.54]Yeah.
[03:12.92]This is a big moment for us.
[03:17.34]We're not getting married.
[03:19.06]But still.
[03:19.60]This is a big moment.
[03:20.56]First GameCube game.
[03:22.74]Look.
[03:23.75]Why should it not work?
[03:27.99]Look at this.
[03:31.35]Chibi Robo.
[03:35.87]Going in.
[03:40.73]No brace?
[03:41.35]No, not today.
[03:41.95]I'm trying to... I gotta relax it a little bit.
[03:46.31]I've been wearing it too much.
[03:47.77]Here it goes.
[03:51.65]Another reason why I wanted to wait, because it's going to do the sound, right?
[03:55.59]Here it comes.
[04:00.65]Here it comes.
[04:10.45]Okay, hold on.
[04:14.23]We gotta test something real quick.
[04:16.49]Because this is a GameCube, so who knows if it's even gonna work.
[04:21.59]So you gotta tell me, uh, am I synced up?
[04:25.93]Is the sound synced up?
[04:28.41]Start.
[04:29.07]We.
[04:29.45]Start.
[04:29.99]We.
[04:30.71]Start.
[04:31.45]We.
[04:32.43]Start.
[04:34.05]Are we good?
[04:36.90]Just gotta make sure.
[04:41.01]No.
[04:51.04]The voice is hard to tell.
[04:52.16]All right.
[04:52.50]Hey, you ready?
[04:55.64]I'm going to do a circle.
[04:57.04]Circle.
[04:58.70]One, two.
[05:06.17]It's good.
[05:07.93]No?
[05:08.57]It's fine.
[05:09.27]He's completely naked.
[05:11.01]Alright, let's go.
[05:12.27]Chibi-Robo time.
[05:13.81]I'm ready.
[05:16.35]I've been looking forward to this for, like, a year at least.
[05:20.59]What's going on?
[05:23.15]Oh, do you want to display the game in progressive scan mode?
[05:26.43]Oh, fuck yeah!
[05:28.61]Are you serious?
[05:29.62]That's HD of 2004.
[05:39.88]Warning, important health and... Before playing, read the health and safety book.
[05:42.39]They did this for Chibi-Robo for the GameCube?
[05:46.55]Why?
[05:46.79]Do you have to move around?
[05:51.71]Oh, you got cartoon clown sounds.
[06:03.39]Chibi-Robo.
[06:11.28]Alright, the screen might be a little... I might have to fix the screen.
[06:18.79]A little off.
[06:21.31]Does it look alright?
[06:27.19]Is it gonna be adjusted?
[06:28.53]This is penis music.
[06:30.22]Why do I know what you're talking about?
[06:34.60]No, it's not.
[06:38.97]This is Why do I know I only have one Well, it's a little loud for me Why I only have like one I only have one barometer for what penis music is There's that one song so that of course I'm gonna think that's what this is Okay, I gotta turn it down it's really loud I

[07:12.86]Good, yeah, get them out because they're going away forever in like three days All right, I gotta turn off Wait, you need a memory card for the Wii?
[07:30.65]I'm just fucking kidding Oh, wait, what about slot B?
[07:37.92]It's in slot B!
[07:39.70]Why does it have to be in slot A?
[07:56.07]It's corrupted.
[07:57.13]What?!
[07:57.65]Alright, let's go.
[07:58.41]Whoa, man.
[07:59.91]What are you talking about?
[08:06.71]What do you mean the memory card is corrupted?
[08:09.25]It's been formatted.
[08:09.99]The memory card slot is corrupted.
[08:11.45]What do you mean it's corrupted?
[08:21.00]Is this alright?
[08:27.34]What the fuck are you talking about?

[08:37.87]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[08:39.12]Just give me a second.
[08:49.63]Why is a memory card corrupted?
[09:04.12]Is this like fucking... Is this lying to me?
[09:07.40]Hold on.
[09:15.30]My Wii just went... What the fuck is... I swear to God, there's a ghost that haunts me.
[09:29.26]There's no way.
[09:30.50]There's no way.
[09:31.10]I get haunted by a fucking ghost when I turn my stream on.
[09:33.96]You guys understand how stupid this is?
[09:35.41]How insane this is?
[09:36.37]I tested this before the stream turned on.
[09:40.01]I literally did this like 35 seconds before the stream started.
[09:43.97]I'm haunted by a ghost.
[09:45.15]There's a ghost that's trying to kill me.
[09:52.25]The memory card slot A must be formatted.
[09:53.83]Format it now.
[09:54.57]Yes!
[09:56.46]If the memory card is formatted, all save data will be erased.
[09:58.44]Fucking do it!
[10:00.50]Okay.
[10:04.57]Okay.
[10:05.09]Nintendo GameCube slot.

[10:26.31]I have 2043 blocks of data.
[10:35.38]Hey, remember that sound?
[10:50.61]Apologize, apologize, apologize.
[10:52.45]That sounded slightly like the thing that I don't like.
[10:54.55]It is an animated character, I don't like them.
[11:03.16]Okay, can I, this is gonna be fine, right?
[11:07.22]Put in health and safety instructions.
[11:11.40]Licensed by Nintendo, Bandai.
[11:13.30]This is before they became Bandai Namco.
[11:17.34]All right, it's been formatted.
[11:27.26]What do I do?
[11:27.72]What do I do?
[11:38.73]Just choose yes.
[11:42.09]Okay, the memory card slot A has been formatted.
[11:49.00]The memory card slot A is corrupted.
[11:59.39]I just did that because I had to.
[12:05.81]Say yes.
[12:06.89]Say yes.
[12:07.35]Just keep saying yes over and over again.
[12:19.64]Blow on the memory card!
[12:21.36]Blow on the memory card!
[12:23.30]What?
[12:23.68]This is so sad!
[12:24.82]I just... Why is...
[12:44.29]512 what's wrong with that all right I pushed it in there like hard
[13:12.15]Am I in slot B?
[13:13.27]I can't do slot B because slot B doesn't... I can't do slot B because it doesn't let me choose slot B. My form has slot A!
[13:25.91]Alright, that's it.
[13:29.60]Alright, it's in slot B. Don't continue.
[13:34.32]Options.
[13:42.78]ream into it all right hold on so now bro run to the store and buy a new memory card but the gamecube you want me to run to the store and get a memory card for a console that has been out of circulation for like 17 years you want me to run to the store
[14:18.52]I'm gonna play a game.
[14:21.11]Wait a minute.
[14:34.41]Just don't say... No, that's horrible.
[14:37.75]I'll get it.
[14:38.51]No, I emulated.
[14:40.67]This game was like a hundred fucking dollars on eBay.
[14:44.27]No.
[14:45.41]No, we're not emulating.
[14:46.75]I have it.
[14:48.01]What a fucking introduction.
[14:49.58]Oh, look at this.
[14:50.34]Oh, I can't wait to... Look, guys.
[14:52.30]Hey, look.
[14:53.64]Oh, yeah.
[14:54.80]The GameCube disc.
[14:57.20]Oh, my God.
[14:58.70]What a fucking joke.
[15:00.56]Should have just fucking emulated the goddamn thing.
[15:06.78]They should just emulate literally everything.
[15:09.30]Companies wonder why the fuck people do this shit.
[15:13.20]I wonder why consumers are downloading fake GameCube game cards and ISOs.
[15:18.95]No, it can't be.
[15:20.45]It can't be because the shit don't work when you're trying to use it for real.
[15:59.68]It's right here!
[16:01.24]GameCube slot A, slot B, it's right fucking here!
[16:04.60]This shit works!
[16:06.36]What?
[16:06.84]Oh.
[16:14.53]I can't put it in slot... Maybe the slot A is corrupted?
[16:17.03]I don't... I had it in slot A. We got to see the same image in slot A.
[16:26.24]You know what?
[16:27.86]I'm not going to turn the fucking stream off until I'm done with the game.
[16:31.44]Let's go.
[16:32.06]I'm not spending... It's been 15 straight minutes of this nonsense.
[16:41.05]I got a memory card in slot B. I should be able to choose... God damn it.
[16:45.71]Let's have a board meeting about what the hell... Why do people... I've heard... Correct me if I'm wrong, fellow person.
[16:53.45]Tides...
[16:55.26]People are downloading video games, and they're playing them without our permission.
[16:59.12]Is there a reason why people are doing this without my permission?
[17:09.26]Just, like, play this VOD to that person.
[17:13.07]I actually don't know anything.
[17:14.39]I just watched.
[17:15.07]I don't know what that means.
[17:16.33]I've never played a video game, so it's lost on me.
[17:34.73]You just talked over the GameCube setup.
[17:37.01]How to fix a corrupted GameCube memory card.
[17:39.41]What?
[17:46.53]Power off the console.
[17:47.86]Remove the card.
[17:48.44]Replace it.
[17:48.86]See the message repeat.
[17:49.52]The message comes back.
[17:50.32]Save any files that aren't corrupted.
[17:52.78]Leave the card alone.
[17:54.10]Place the card away from anything electronic for a week.
[17:59.86]Hold on.
[18:01.46]Hold on.
[18:02.36]No.
[18:03.14]Excuse me.
[18:05.02]Look at this!
[18:06.62]Are you trying to tell me that this is a real website?
[18:13.64]This is a copypasta of the streamer.
[18:15.66]I met the streamer at the fucking Walgreens.
[18:18.80]Huh?
[18:41.75]This can only be done on a GameCube console.
[18:44.21]If these steps don't work, it must be reformatted.
[18:46.99]It can only be done on a GameCube console.
[18:54.76]Let's go.
[18:55.34]Fucking Chibi-Robo.
[18:56.32]I'm ready.
[18:56.72]There's no card in slot A. Who cares?
[19:00.50]Continue without saving.
[19:02.04]I'll find a way.
[19:04.48]Hey, Chibi-Robo.
[19:06.68]I can pick slot B when I save the game.
[19:08.40]I guarantee it.
[19:21.21]Happy birthday, Jenny!
[19:27.79]There you go, I got you this hat as a special present from me!
[19:35.02]I see a coin!
[19:35.78]I see a coin!
[19:36.48]I see a coin!
[19:37.14]That's all I care about.
[19:37.84]Don't like it?
[19:46.21]What's wrong?
[19:54.14]Jenny, you're eight now.
[19:54.98]You can't run around in a frog costume all day.
[19:56.94]You need a real hat.
[19:59.70]Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit.
[20:03.34]Oh, Jenny.
[20:05.55]Woof, woof.
[20:06.35]Ruff, ruff.
[20:16.83]Oh, I got a present for her, too.
[20:18.55]Do you, Tao?
[20:20.86]I got a present for her too, do you, Tao?
[20:25.07]Dog has a present?
[20:25.75]It's a bone!
[20:28.25]Poof!
[20:32.51]Wow, good dog.
[20:33.59]How did you rock it?
[20:37.04]Vivid, vivid.
[20:39.34]Another 3D movie maker family.
[20:44.30]All right, now it's my turn.
[20:46.26]You're just gonna love my gift, Jenny.
[20:53.74]Yeah, right.
[20:57.12]By the way, what an interesting t-shirt.
[20:59.42]It just says three on it.
[21:03.02]Don't you want that shirt?
[21:06.05]What is that?
[21:06.79]You know we can't afford... Jenny said she wanted one.
[21:12.37]Rip it.
[21:14.86]Oh, honey, you're not fooling anyone.
[21:16.04]You only wanted one for yourself.
[21:18.51]Is this a chibi robo?
[21:20.39]The latest and greatest in household robots?
[21:24.67]We'll talk about this later.
[21:27.50]What do you think, Jenny?
[21:29.56]Do you love it?
[21:30.36]You love it, right?
[21:31.02]Uh, Jenny's not communicating.
[21:43.93]This is my eyes?
[21:44.85]Ahem.
[21:48.19]Get ready, chibi robo.
[21:49.57]It's almost showtime.
[21:50.85]This is when I get out?
[21:54.07]And I'm gonna be like, look at me!
[22:02.90]They're talking like sims, but scary.
[22:07.02]What do you think?
[22:07.60]Should I flip the switch?
[22:09.40]Let's go.
[22:14.62]All right, get ready to rovo!
[22:18.86]Ratchet, ratchet, we at it.
[22:22.98]Holy shit, it really is going on.
[22:50.46]This is quite an introduction.
[22:54.04]I can't wait to get the coin on the counter.
[22:59.64]Yay, chibi robo!
[23:05.43]Hello, hello!
[23:07.65]Hello, there.
[23:10.71]Ribbit.
[23:12.29]Arf.
[23:13.31]We're here to make you happy.
[23:16.50]I'm Telly, and this is Chibi-Robo.
[23:19.32]Amazing!
[23:21.31]Ribbit.
[23:22.83]Woof.
[23:25.23]Oh!
[23:25.81]Hey, is this a birthday party?
[23:29.57]You got that right.
[23:30.59]Uh-oh, Chibi-Robo.
[23:34.19]It looks like we've come to the party empty-handed.
[23:36.35]We need to find a present for Jenny, and fast.
[23:39.73]Is this a children's game?
[23:42.31]Oh.
[23:47.82]How about that flower, Chibi-Robo?
[23:52.46]No.
[23:54.72]No.
[23:55.82]Really?
[23:56.04]Are you sure?
[23:56.50]I think it's perfect for Jenny.
[24:01.52]No.
[24:02.32]I don't like... I don't want to give that present.
[24:08.20]Really?
[24:08.59]Are you sure?
[24:09.67]I think it's perfect for Jenny.
[24:11.43]Oh, we're getting forced into saying yes.
[24:13.13]Okay.
[24:14.37]Yes, I do agree with you.
[24:17.43]I'll leave the rest to you, Chibi-Robo.
[24:19.39]Whoa, the game just got way louder.
[24:21.03]I have a big plug on my back?
[24:24.73]Uh, Chibi-Robo, don't put that plug in any of the water or any food!
[24:31.76]Chibi, don't dunk the end of the plug into the orange juice!
[24:34.96]Alright, let's get it.
[24:38.90]How do I jump?
[24:47.58]What?
[24:48.50]They didn't tell me how to move.
[24:51.62]This is so loud.
[24:56.62]Jenny!
[24:57.90]All right, let's get it.
[25:04.62]I got it.
[25:04.96]Okay, Rose.
[25:08.13]That fits in there?
[25:10.17]Hot.
[25:12.37]Diggity.
[25:13.63]Dogs.
[25:16.57]That's awesome.
[25:23.45]Wow.
[25:25.63]Excellent.
[25:27.51]Chibi-Robo, Chibi-Robo.
[25:29.43]You should try using your Chibi-Copter.
[25:32.33]It comes standard in all Chibi-Robo models.
[25:34.49]All you have to do is equip it.
[25:36.63]You can't fly upwards with it, but... Listen to this.
[25:40.78]You can use it to slowly fall from high places.
[25:43.00]That way you won't hurt with this fall damage.
[25:46.07]Press X to open the equip screen.
[25:50.17]Tilt left or right to select the Chibi Copter, and then press A to equip it.
[25:55.89]So I'm a go-go gadget.
[25:59.12]Oh, and if you hold down A, you'll hover horizontally for a short time.
[26:02.86]It's handy when you want to fly over small gaps or drop from high places.
[26:06.80]Hey, listen up, Chibi Robo.
[26:08.78]Use the Chibi Copter, okay?
[26:12.36]I don't want you to take a nasty fall.
[26:14.08]Alright, you've made it very clear.
[26:17.00]There's B to put the copter away.
[26:31.97]Okay, so that's it.
[26:34.02]This toy sucks.
[26:35.72]Imagine getting this on Christmas.
[26:37.98]Oh, wow.
[26:39.60]That's really cool.
[26:49.14]Yes, I was trying to dunk the thing in the orange juice.
[26:51.74]Alright, good.
[26:55.46]Now what?
[26:57.00]Hurry up and give that flower to... Oh.
[26:58.22]Come here.
[27:02.67]I got a flower for you.
[27:09.25]I think Miss Sanderson made this cake.
[27:12.27]You can't eat anything anyway, Chibi-Robo.
[27:15.70]Oh.
[27:16.56]Sorry, I didn't mean to hurt your feelings.
[27:19.22]Oh!
[27:20.50]If you move next to an object and you see the exclamation icon, press A. I just did!
[27:30.67]What feelings?
[27:33.09]Oh, right.
[27:33.73]It's a robot.
[27:46.12]Do I have to float over there?
[27:49.20]Coin behind turkey?
[27:50.20]Oh, shit!
[27:55.23]Got it!
[28:00.07]What about the turkey?
[28:01.61]Looks like chicken is on the menu tonight.
[28:04.43]Chicken.
[28:04.81]That's a word that brings back some really bad memories from me.
[28:10.01]Oh, but maybe now isn't the time to talk about that.
[28:11.86]What?
[28:15.03]Alright, we gotta float over there.
[28:19.57]Take out the helicopter.
[28:21.67]Let's go.
[28:22.37]Here we go.
[28:22.73]Float onto the cake.
[28:25.31]On cake.
[28:26.15]Here we go.
[28:28.55]Give rose.
[28:30.37]I think this is... I can't do anything anyway.
[28:33.80]How do I give the rose?
[28:35.42]Do I have to equip it?
[28:42.54]Wait.
[28:43.24]Frog ring?
[28:45.27]I'm looking through my eyes.
[28:46.17]Alright, how do I give you the... Just go to... I already did that.
[29:01.85]Was I not close?
[29:02.89]Alright, I tried to do that before.
[29:04.39]I guess I wasn't close enough.
[29:10.03]Chibi Robo, give the rose to Jenny.
[29:12.49]Yes.
[29:18.74]Here you go.
[29:22.52]This game is cute.
[29:24.04]It looks very cute.
[29:27.24]You got 20 happy points.
[29:30.46]Are they sad points?
[29:31.56]And you got 120... I don't know.
[29:34.00]What is that?
[29:39.40]What kind of currency is that?
[29:45.57]Spread the happiness.
[29:47.35]Earn happy points in moolah by making people happy.
[29:50.67]Of course, earning lots of happy points will raise your chibi robo ranking.
[29:55.01]Let's do our best to get you into first place.
[29:56.84]Are there other items in the house?
[30:01.58]I have a genie to blow out the candles.
[30:04.14]Do I have to compete with the vacuum cleaner and the lysol or what?
[30:14.43]One.
[30:15.37]Two.
[30:15.71]Yeah.
[30:20.49]Although I really can't agree with their use of candles on the cake.
[30:24.43]Blow it out on the cake.
[30:25.31]That's disgusting.
[30:25.97]Now nobody wants to eat the cake because the little kids spit all over the cake.
[30:30.97]What I like to see is a separate cupcake that has a candle on it.
[30:36.95]You blow the two or three candles on one little cupcake.
[30:40.07]They blow that all over the cupcake.
[30:42.14]Okay, cool.
[30:42.64]The cupcake is fine.
[30:43.32]Everyone can eat it.
[30:48.82]Good work, Chibi-Robo.
[30:54.48]You looked a bit nervous at first, but you came through like a pro.
[30:59.08]Put plastic over the cake?
[31:00.62]Why would you... Now listen, we need to make ourselves useful to the Sandersons, right?
[31:08.18]Okay.
[31:09.92]Let's adjust your happy point total.
[31:12.38]But it gets adjusted?
[31:16.25]Your chibi ranking has gone from 1,000,000 to 782,000.
[31:20.83]Why did I lose happy points?
[31:25.87]Oh, I'm gaining, right.
[31:27.59]I'm gaining rank.
[31:31.77]Get out there and earn a ton of happy points and grab yourself the top chibi ranking.
[31:36.86]When you reach top chibi ranking, why, you'll be upgraded to super chibi robo.
[31:50.23]Take it from me, Television.
[31:51.75]Ah, that's a good name.
[31:54.40]I'll do what I can to lend you a hand.
[31:55.94]You can count on me.
[32:01.90]Television.
[32:02.86]Professor E. Gadd.
[32:06.47]Yes, I would love to save the game!
[32:08.29]I would love to.
[32:09.33]And I'd like to do it in slot B. Fuck!
[32:18.27]Let's go.
[32:18.55]So I can't pick the slot.
[32:19.57]Really, I can't.
[32:20.09]Oh, this is so cool and cute.
[32:20.95]Hold on.
[32:21.29]Can I not...
[32:52.98]Yes, I want to save.
[32:55.32]God damn it.
[32:55.90]This is an ungrounded outlet.
[32:59.65]Don't do that.
[33:05.85]I would like to save.
[33:09.58]God damn it.
[33:10.44]Okay.
[33:13.12]Okay.
[33:26.33]Go, go, go!
[33:33.26]I don't know what to do.
[33:38.96]I don't know what to do.
[33:41.39]I know what I have to do, which is unfortunate.
[33:43.89]I have to either beat the whole game in one stream, or I have to leave the fucking Wii turned on and on overnight.
[33:54.96]This is literally a two stream game, goddammit.
[33:58.62]Amazon one day shipping.
[33:59.94]Can I do Amazon same day?
[34:02.68]Oh.
[34:02.78]Please.
[34:02.98]Please.
[34:03.18]No.
[34:24.37]God damn it.
[34:25.27]This is bad.
[34:33.31]The game is upwards of like 14 hours.
[34:42.83]How long is the game?
[34:46.53]How long is the game?
[34:49.50]Blow into the port.
[34:54.16]12 to 15 hours?
[34:57.50]About 12 hours?
[34:58.22]12 to 20 hours?
[35:00.87]Okay.
[35:01.89]Okay.
[35:05.43]It takes 15 hours to beat this game on a speedrun.
[35:07.19]I don't believe that.
[35:08.07]I'm gonna blow in the port.
[35:09.33]Hold on.
[35:09.53]We're gonna try everything.
[35:25.71]Make sure it's got good contact with the receptacles.
[35:29.21]Good contact.
[35:34.06]Like good, I just like got it in there, good contact.
[35:39.02]Let's try it again.
[35:46.35]Just pretend you're not streaming so the ghost leaves.
[35:50.11]You just spit all over the cake.
[35:51.45]It's gonna be alright.
[35:52.15]I know, I know about happy points.
[35:55.00]Fuck.
[35:56.54]Save the game.
[35:57.14]Come on.
[35:57.54]Right here.
[35:57.86]Let's go.
[35:58.24]I just got good contact.
[36:08.85]Fuck.
[36:09.91]Alright, um...
[36:17.32]I had this problem before.
[36:18.20]You literally have to smack it against something hard.
[36:20.64]Like, with a fucking hammer?
[36:21.96]I need to hit my GameCube memory card with a hammer.
[36:27.25]Is that what you're telling me to do?
[36:28.17]Hit it with a fucking hammer.
[36:30.61]Are you serious?
[36:31.69]No, that's not... It's true?
[36:46.93]Shake it?
[36:53.03]This is not doing anything!
[36:54.45]Oh my gosh, shake it!
[37:05.50]Smack it around!
[37:35.64]Save the game.
[37:36.10]Yes I would, yes.
[38:03.34]Just leave the Wii turned on.
[38:04.68]That's so bad.
[38:05.70]It's gonna... Oh, I'm so fucking sad.
[38:13.81]Leave the Wii turned on.
[38:23.25]One last thing.
[38:24.65]One last thing.
[38:25.29]I'm gonna try one last fucking thing.
[38:40.45]I'm going to close it into the door.
[38:41.65]He's going to get a hammer, MonkaS.
[38:45.01]No, I'm not going to get a fucking hammer.
[38:46.49]I'm not stupid.
[38:50.87]I'm not going to go get a fucking hammer.
[38:52.29]What I'm going to do is I'm just going to close it into the closet.
[38:56.11]Look.
[38:58.23]I'm not naked, don't worry.
[39:00.79]I do have my nails a wicked long, so fucking relax.
[39:02.81]I don't want you to see the secret stash of GameCube games, though.
[39:05.85]Alright, whatever.
[39:09.27]You get this.
[39:14.00]Stay right there.
[39:32.21]Okay.
[39:32.75]Ow.
[39:33.15]All right, see in here?
[39:35.98]You see that?
[39:37.22]It's in there right now.
[39:38.25]It's literally inside of here.
[39:40.41]It's right there.
[39:41.05]You see it?
[39:41.65]Can you see the GameCube memory card?
[40:13.16]Not harder.
[40:13.80]That's a bad idea.
[40:14.68]Here we go.
[40:37.28]It's not going to fucking do anything.
[40:39.18]It's not going to work.
[40:40.45]I just fucking... It's not going to happen.
[40:43.27]This thing is fucked up.
[40:45.35]I'm going to Amazon same day a fucking memory card.
[40:48.01]What time is it?
[40:51.89]Just turn off the Wii completely and unplug it.
[40:54.62]What?
[40:54.96]I already did that.
[40:56.90]I can't.
[41:02.43]Turn the Wii off.
[41:03.96]No, I have to... I guess we didn't do that much.
[41:06.20]Should I try turning the Wii off?
[41:09.42]Alright, you ready?
[41:09.90]Okay, here we go.
[41:10.64]No.
[41:11.60]Turn the Wii off.
[41:14.33]No, yes, no.
[41:15.33]Just neutralize.
[41:16.97]What?
[41:17.91]Turn it upside down.
[41:18.57]No, yes.
[41:19.23]Make him go to GameStop.
[41:20.69]No, you can't buy these anywhere.
[41:26.90]You have to... It's alright, alright.
[41:28.28]I'm gonna do one more fucking thing.
[41:29.41]You ready for this?
[41:30.65]If this doesn't work, then fuck it.
[41:32.79]I'm gonna have to just play... You have to restart the game.
[41:39.07]You have to turn it off.
[41:41.69]What do you mean turn... Okay, hold on.
[41:44.56]It was just a shitty... It was just a dumb tutorial.
[41:50.23]We can wait, buy a new one.
[41:52.59]It's right here, hold on.
[41:54.17]Alright, I'm gonna fucking format the card in the Wii menu, turn the console off, turn it back on.
[42:03.19]Okay, alright, that's the plan.
[42:06.38]Right?
[42:06.62]Is that the way that I need to try?
[42:08.46]It's not gonna work?
[42:11.26]No, no, no, no, no.
[42:12.82]Reset your Wi-Fi.
[42:14.62]Reformat the card.
[42:15.42]Hold on a second.
[42:17.94]I know, I know, stop talking, guys, stop, stop, stop talking, nobody talk.
[42:21.00]Nobody, stop, nobody, stop talking, stop talking.
[42:27.12]Restart the console and a little warning should come up at the start of the last thing the card needs to be formatted.
[42:31.54]Reformat the card.
[42:33.34]The card must be reformatted.
[42:34.39]This can only be done in a GameCube console.
[42:36.51]All the data in the card must be deleted.
[42:37.77]Restart the console and a little warning should come up.
[42:39.71]This is not, this is a Wii.
[42:41.47]The last thing the card needs to be reformatted.
[42:42.77]Yes, yes.
[42:45.81]This reformatted car will work again with both the GameCube and the Wii.
[42:52.77]I need a GameCube to do this.
[42:56.22]I already did this.
[43:03.58]Okay.
[43:06.46]I'm just gonna leave the fucking Wii on.
[43:16.17]Guys, there's definitely no such thing as an Amazon same-day delivery for a GameCube memory card.
[43:31.18]I'm gonna leave the fucking Wii turned on?
[43:37.25]Same-hour delivery.
[43:43.57]What happens if I lose without a save file?
[43:45.67]Leave the stream on 2.
[43:49.04]Alright, well.
[43:50.04]I don't know.
[43:50.62]I don't think so.
[43:51.24]This is not a game where you lose and die and go to game over.
[43:54.48]I don't think so.
[44:04.15]Call GameStop?
[44:05.89]Guys, they're closing GameStops everywhere.
[44:08.15]No one's going in them.
[44:16.23]It just needs to be an SD card.
[44:17.55]How's that going to fit in the top slot?
[44:26.90]Oh, Mr. Sanderson.
[44:27.88]Tsk, tsk, tsk.
[44:28.90]He had a little too much fun at the party.
[44:31.18]I think he passed out from excitement.
[44:35.32]It goes in the front slot.
[44:36.22]Yeah, for the Wii, you need a GameCube memory card to be able to save GameCube games.
[44:39.99]The Wii is just a GameCube.
[44:42.66]It's like the same hardware.
[44:43.78]They just made it a little faster.
[44:45.14]Look, I've done my research.
[44:46.12]Don't worry.
[44:51.70]It is.
[44:52.00]No, it is.
[44:52.44]It is.
[44:53.00]People that don't know that, the Wii is just a GameCube with a new shell that they made a little bit faster.
[44:58.58]That's the truth.
[44:59.20]Go look it up right now.
[44:59.92]I want you to look it up so you go, oh, fuck.
[45:01.54]He was right.
[45:02.00]Holy shit.
[45:05.70]SD cards work?
[45:08.01]No, they don't.
[45:08.55]No, they don't, because it's not going to read that in slot A or B for the GameCube.
[45:12.70]Trust me, I did my research.
[45:19.92]Here's what's going to happen, okay?
[45:21.76]I'm going to Amazon next day for tomorrow a new memory card.
[45:26.00]Wii is going to stay on.
[45:27.56]Tomorrow morning, when, you know, here's the new memory card, I'm going to put it in Save the Game.
[45:45.53]You'll see a sun symbol during the day and the moon symbol at night.
[45:49.09]The moon is out right now, so that means it's nighttime.
[45:53.33]What if that card is corrupted too?
[45:55.91]If that doesn't work, then I'm just gonna play it.
[45:58.73]It'll be on still.
[46:03.98]And plus, I might just fucking beat the game tonight.
[46:11.37]Oh my god, I'm cleaning.
[46:12.60]Proper trash.
[46:15.18]Always put refuse in a proper receptacle.
[46:21.18]Holy shit, I get to clean up?
[46:25.86]Wow.
[46:26.57]Unbelievable.
[46:31.71]What's over here?
[46:32.19]This is trash.
[46:36.23]Candy wrapper.
[46:37.75]Always put refuse in a proper receptacle.
[46:42.26]We get to pick up trash.
[46:44.35]Oh, I love this game.
[46:45.27]I'm so glad I can save it with my fucking memory card that doesn't work.
[46:57.16]Make sure to save your progress.
[46:58.66]Yeah, it's called leave the Wii turned on until I can somehow get a memory card here overnight.
[47:07.27]Coins?
[47:19.62]When's the last time you saved?
[47:21.12]Oh, that's a good question.
[47:27.89]Well, that's why it doesn't make any sense, because when I reformatted on the Wii menu, it's like, oh, here you go.
[47:35.35]2,043 blocks.
[47:35.75]And then I turned this on, and it's like, this thing's fucked up.
[47:39.36]I can't use this.
[47:47.52]I'm going to get whatever this is.
[47:51.78]Wait, can I pull this out?
[47:52.98]Oh, there we go.
[47:57.96]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[48:01.24]You guys, is it Amazon, I think?
[48:04.16]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[48:04.92]Compatible for Wii GameCube.
[48:09.42]I already, this is one of the, I bought one of these.
[48:12.70]Free, free one day delivery.
[48:18.10]Alright, everyone hold on.
[48:20.20]Nobody move.
[48:22.35]Free one day delivery.
[48:33.31]He wants to put a two year protection plan.
[48:42.39]Sure.
[48:43.67]I'll take a two year protection.
[48:45.53]You should have bought the two year protection plan.
[48:54.70]I'm losing power.
[48:55.48]Oh shit, I am.
[48:56.30]Hold on, pause again.
[48:58.84]What a fucking joke.
[49:03.70]Alright, let me see.
[49:04.44]Hold on, I'm buying something.
[49:14.31]Hold on, I'm purchasing something.
[49:15.65]Give me a sec.
[49:21.49]Tomorrow.
[49:22.79]One day delivery.
[49:30.04]What am I gonna do?
[49:30.90]I have to get one for tomorrow.
[49:32.25]Alright, fuck it.
[49:39.45]Okay.
[49:45.54]Tomorrow night.
[49:47.36]Beat it in one playthrough.
[49:48.68]Actually, we have to test something.
[49:55.58]Uh, we have to test to see if I, like, jump off of a cliff and die.
[49:58.42]What happens?
[50:02.56]I got a frog card.
[50:07.89]Huey explodes.
[50:10.67]It loads the last save.
[50:12.33]We need to test it, because if that's the case, then I have to, like, do something else today.
[50:27.73]Did that hurt?
[50:31.07]You're playing hardcore mode.
[50:32.41]You get sent back to the chibi house, don't worry.
[50:37.64]Okay, alright.
[50:44.02]Cookie crumbs?
[50:50.07]So that actually is my power, so I have to plug in?
[50:56.73]Why does every step have to be another note?
[51:09.46]Get the Germa-branded memory card.
[51:11.58]Why the fuck is this so stupid?
[51:15.10]You got 2,043 blocks open.
[51:17.12]Okay, cool.
[51:18.04]Just kidding.
[51:18.52]The whole thing's corrupted.
[51:19.54]You can't use it.
[51:20.12]Goodbye.
[51:27.94]It's a red bubble memory card.
[51:33.09]Glad he had a good time.
[51:35.31]Oh!
[51:36.21]Walking around drains your battery.
[51:37.65]Keep an eye on your energy.
[51:39.45]If your battery starts to run out, plug into an outlet and recharge.
[51:42.01]Oh, that's cool.
[51:45.38]What is this thing?
[51:47.68]Is it combat?
[51:50.58]Dear diary, tonight I'm in my usual spot.
[51:53.10]Head in the living room, body in the kitchen.
[51:56.68]Oh, it's so hard to watch him.
[51:57.60]That knight in shiny armor.
[52:00.66]Ugh!
[52:00.86]Ugh!
[52:27.56]Those pupils.
[52:29.34]Are you looking at my diary?
[52:30.88]Stop it!
[52:31.50]Oh, what a cad!
[52:32.42]Oh, who are you?
[52:34.40]Hey, now what's all the racket?
[52:41.88]Oh, what in the... That toy is talking.
[52:43.71]That's just how things work in this house.
[52:47.67]Isn't that how it works everywhere?
[52:50.57]Really?
[52:50.85]Well, that's a bit of a shocker.
[52:51.99]So I take it there are other toys?
[52:55.10]How rude of me.
[52:55.84]My name is Television, and this is Chibi-Robo.
[53:01.73]My name is Sophie.
[53:04.03]Well, we're pleased as punch to meet you.
[53:08.11]I was just writing in my diary, and I thought you were trying to peek.
[53:10.92]You scared me.
[53:13.32]No worries.
[53:13.70]Happens all the time.
[53:14.40]Chibi-Robo's small, so it's easy for him to sneak up on you.
[53:18.20]Please allow me to apologize on his behalf.
[53:19.94]We're both sorry if we startled you.
[53:23.04]Well, as long as you didn't read about my secret passionate love for Drake Redcrest, it's fine.
[53:29.03]Say, why doesn't Chibi-Robo apologize himself?
[53:33.29]Oh, man.
[53:33.79]Apologizing is a vital component of the manager's work.
[53:39.07]You're his manager?
[53:40.19]Seriously?
[53:42.07]Oh, that's kind of weird.
[53:42.97]Hold on, I need to record this moment so I don't forget.
[53:44.93]I'm being mocked right now.
[53:50.21]Girls in the Diary, this could be a while.
[53:51.77]I guess I'll be leaving.
[53:53.10]Can I pick anything?
[53:59.48]What else?
[53:59.72]Can I do anything else with you?
[54:01.96]Manager.
[54:03.21]I've never heard the word in real life before, but it sounds very important.
[54:06.95]Chibi Robo and Telly seem very close.
[54:09.73]It's nice to see good friends like that.
[54:12.35]Also, Drake is patrolling the area again.
[54:14.33]I love the way his big boots clump around.
[54:16.28]It's so manly.
[54:20.99]If Drake does his pose right in front of me, I think I'll have to run away.
[54:24.30]I'd be so embarrassed.
[54:28.82]Tee hee.
[54:29.48]What the fuck is going on?
[54:30.98]Hey, are you trying to peek at my diary again?
[54:39.55]Yeah.
[54:45.01]God, you're a big creepo, chibi robo.
[54:52.69]More trash.
[54:53.13]Let's get it.
[55:03.05]This is something already plugged in.
[55:04.31]Can I unplug this?
[55:10.94]Or I can climb it.
[55:14.12]I can climb up that cord.
[55:29.67]Oh, there's a record player.
[55:30.66]Should I jump off and die?
[55:34.16]To make sure?
[55:34.60]What do you think?
[55:35.74]Let's turn this on first.
[55:40.96]What's in the... Is it a little box?
[55:42.10]What's in the box?
[55:45.88]Wait, you can pull.
[55:48.31]Okay.
[56:01.40]Should I not have done that?
[56:06.08]Why is it playing, like, drunk music?
[56:08.02]I wanna pick this up.
[56:15.56]Can I move this?
[56:23.27]What does that mean?
[56:23.93]S?
[56:33.31]Okay.
[56:55.41]You have to be in bed during the day.
[56:57.45]Let's go.
[56:57.69]Yeah, I would!
[57:21.09]Wii Options, Data Management, Save Data, Nintendo GameCube.
[57:23.49]I already did that.
[57:26.03]We saw that it was actually working.
[57:28.33]And there were blocks open.
[57:29.63]I've done that twice.
[57:31.13]It's not gonna work.
[57:31.73]Alright, let's get out here.
[57:43.00]Living room, let's go!
[57:43.86]Do it thrice.
[57:49.08]Alright, we gotta make it to Happy Point.
[57:58.17]What's under here?
[58:01.46]Oh, coins.
[58:06.88]Oh, I gotta climb that.
[58:07.80]Get the trash.
[58:14.42]I thought that was a Pepe face for a second.
[58:16.10]I was like, what the fuck?
[58:16.94]Alright, let's go up.
[58:25.44]Is there a... Oh, I have a helicopter, don't I?
[58:28.58]Okay, let's get that out.
[58:31.76]Nice.
[58:32.02]Alright, put it away.
[58:35.22]I'll just clean up after Dad.
[58:38.46]Wink.
[58:38.70]Alright, I gotta clean up after Dad's mess.
[58:48.43]Alright, good.
[58:54.77]Hey there, cheapy.
[58:55.71]Robo, how goes it?
[58:56.37]You getting used to our house yet?
[58:59.81]My wife is mad at me, but don't worry about it.
[59:02.71]Just go get a lot of happy points, okay?
[59:06.50]Hell, I'm trying to pick up the trash.
[59:09.34]Make this cheese prompt.
[59:12.52]Save their marriage.
[59:17.18]Alright, we're doing a trash run first.
[59:19.02]That's important.
[59:21.88]Candy bag.
[59:24.18]Yep, into the trash.
[59:27.94]Go marry his wife.
[59:31.44]That's not how that works.
[59:35.10]Any more crumbs?
[59:35.96]Alright.
[59:39.10]What about over here?
[59:39.64]Can I fly that far?
[59:44.81]No.
[59:45.25]Clean up the couch, though, so that's alright.
[59:46.53]Keep your rubble, your battery's running low.
[59:48.65]Oh, fuck.
[59:50.55]If your body flashes red, plug it into an outlet, quick!
[59:56.35]Where's the outlet in this goddamn house?
[60:00.37]I need an outlet right now.
[60:05.35]Where are your outlets?
[60:13.36]Where the fuck is any of your stuff plugged in?
[60:15.10]There we go.
[60:22.95]Um.
[60:25.30]Is this a fake outlet?
[60:56.85]You have 80% iPhone battery.
[60:58.97]Alright, let's go.
[61:05.37]More coins.
[61:06.19]Are those happy coins or are they regular coins?
[61:08.23]Alright, I want to do... Uh, what do I want to do?
[61:11.67]Here's my house.
[61:14.03]Can I look?
[61:14.31]Can I get like a bird's eye view?
[61:15.31]I guess I can look.
[61:15.91]Okay.
[61:16.23]Wait, wait.
[61:16.51]There's trash under there.
[61:17.17]Where's the trash can?
[61:23.96]Move faster with the plug.
[61:25.36]Oh.
[61:29.56]Now give me the trash.
[61:36.07]It's you?
[61:36.61]What?
[61:37.69]No, it's not.
[61:44.25]It says put it in the proper receptacle.
[61:47.49]Wait, am I the trash?
[61:50.45]Am I the trash can?
[61:51.81]No.
[61:52.09]There's a trash can over here, right?
[61:59.85]No, I'm definitely not that trash.
[62:07.99]There's trash right here, right?
[62:09.19]That's trash can.
[62:12.79]Lob it in with A. What?
[62:18.24]Oh, nice!
[62:21.00]That's right, you can also get happy points by throwing garbage away.
[62:24.42]Look at all the trash I have!
[62:30.84]I picked up a ton of stuff.
[62:34.72]Look at all the cheese I got.
[62:37.13]You got a total of 31 happy points.
[62:38.85]You got 310 bucks.
[62:40.41]Nice.
[62:40.81]Alright, it's almost time to go to bed.
[62:43.87]Let's get some more trash.
[62:45.09]This is a janitor game.
[62:56.85]It's my favorite kind of game.
[63:13.46]You can use an SD card.
[63:16.04]How difficult is it to use?
[63:17.06]I have an SD card somewhere in this house.
[63:20.40]How difficult is that to do?
[63:21.40]Is anybody, is that like hard to set that up?
[63:25.50]No, you can't.
[63:26.38]Why am I being lied to?
[63:27.56]I can't throw it from here?
[63:29.42]Wow.
[63:45.56]It has to be modded.
[63:49.57]That's way out of my jurisdiction.
[63:51.33]Alright, what about the girl?
[64:02.35]Just jailbreak your console.
[64:04.09]I feel like that's a day project.
[64:07.05]You know what I mean?
[64:07.47]Like an all day project.
[64:08.51]You know, I'm going to jailbreak my Wii today.
[64:17.50]Takes 20 minutes.
[64:23.46]For you.
[64:27.95]Plus, how am I ever going to send it back for an official Nintendo warranty inspection, guys?
[64:37.83]Ribbit, ribbit.
[64:38.67]Can I do anything with this?
[64:40.05]Should I get the frog coins?
[64:43.98]Speaking of coins.
[64:44.64]Alright, it's almost time for bed.
[64:50.10]I got money this time.
[64:50.86]He's leaving her hanging.
[65:03.47]Ribbit, ribbit.
[65:06.99]She just goes... She eats you.
[65:14.72]I can draw a ribbon.
[65:18.06]Jenny just gave you 13 happy points.
[65:20.69]Spread the happiness.
[65:25.49]Draw a bit.
[65:26.03]What are you gonna draw?
[65:28.81]Can I help?
[65:33.30]Alright, what do I... I gotta get up here.
[65:34.76]I gotta climb on top of the coffee table.
[65:47.44]13 happy points.
[65:47.98]That's nothing.
[65:49.40]Look at all the shit that's up there.
[65:50.30]I want to get up here.
[65:51.86]How much time do I have?
[65:52.54]Am I going to PAX?
[65:56.87]I'm not going to PAX.
[65:59.31]I will not be at PAX.
[66:00.45]Uh-oh.
[66:01.29]Time's up.
[66:02.29]Get the trash quick.
[66:05.62]Awww.
[66:08.82]Your chibi ranking has gone from 7 to 82 to- that was a huge increase.
[66:37.86]Good job, Chibi-Robo!
[66:39.50]You passed almost half a million inactive accounts!
[66:42.90]Great.
[66:47.73]In order to get the next bonus battery, you need 13 more happy points.
[66:52.91]If you ever reach the top of the rankings, you get to become Super Chibi-Robo!
[66:58.13]Super Chibi-Frog!
[67:03.54]Well, maybe I'm speaking too soon, but you'll be upgraded to the super luxurious, super Chibi Frog Robo, or that's what I've heard.
[67:09.00]The girlbots won't be able to leave you alone.
[67:13.95]While you're here, Chibi Robo, would you like to save?
[67:17.69]Maybe one time it'll work.
[67:20.29]You know what I mean?
[67:21.59]What if it just works one of these times?
[67:23.05]It might just work.
[67:32.00]I have an idea.
[67:34.71]Format it.
[67:35.63]Erase all, save, and format the data.
[67:37.51]Okay?
[67:38.55]Memory card's been formatted.
[67:39.75]Now what if I pull it out?
[67:44.08]Maybe if I pull it out... Right?
[67:51.72]Let me try this.
[67:53.62]Because it's... Oh, it's been formatted.
[67:55.08]Now I'm going to pull the card out.
[67:58.62]Okay.
[67:59.60]Alright.
[68:01.75]Now I wonder...
[68:10.84]Okay, that didn't work.
[68:23.75]Does that sound the Wii?
[68:24.71]No, it's the game.
[68:25.31]If I slot B, I can't put anything in slot B. The game doesn't recognize slot B. You can't save to slot B for some reason.
[68:38.63]And this guide says all you have to do... Wait, what?
[68:41.50]This guide says all you have to do is download two things.
[68:47.02]Why can I not scroll up anymore?
[68:53.80]Download two things, Monka-esque.
[68:57.01]No, it'll be alright.
[68:58.67]I'll figure it out.
[69:00.47]I'm just gonna have to just leave it on until tomorrow and then put the new card in.
[69:08.73]Or, so after, when the stream is over, I might go figure out how to get that saved tonight before I go to bed, you know what I'm saying?
[69:17.19]Like, I'm gonna make sure that this is saved before I go to sleep.
[69:27.70]Just please, for the love of God, do not turn off, like, the power.
[69:35.59]Okay, I hope the bill's been paid.
[69:36.91]It has.
[69:38.49]But one of the... I'm freaking out.
[69:40.85]Can I play a video game?
[69:42.37]Welcome to the Chibi PC.
[69:45.52]Recycletron.
[69:46.46]Living room ladder?
[69:47.36]Collect scrap to build utility bots.
[70:04.12]Okay.
[70:04.36]How much scrap do I have?
[70:06.62]A ladder that reaches high places.
[70:08.10]Place near the chibi robo house.
[70:09.66]Build it.
[70:11.48]I don't have any scraps.
[70:13.98]Online shop.
[70:15.70]Timer 10.
[70:16.27]Timer 15.
[70:18.51]Pink flower seeds.
[70:19.71]Chibi blaster.
[70:21.19]Oh, this is cool.
[70:21.95]Alright.
[70:22.13]I don't have any money.
[70:31.04]I don't have any points.
[70:34.19]There are game over screens.
[70:36.98]This is a ticking time buff.
[70:38.18]There are game over screens that require a load.
[70:39.98]You're going to be very sad.
[70:42.82]No, don't say this.
[71:05.07]Hold on.
[71:07.43]Empty SD card.
[71:08.65]SD card reader for PC.
[71:14.35]Download Banner Bomb 2 from the download link.
[71:23.95]I can't do this right now.
[71:36.35]That's not a virus.
[71:37.43]I know, I know.
[71:38.61]I gotta figure out what the fuck I want to do here.
[71:42.63]Um... Shit.
[71:53.38]Okay.
[71:53.64]I have an idea.
[71:55.40]I have an idea.
[71:58.78]Let me just check something real quick.
[72:08.62]Just play another game?
[72:10.64]Yeah, we might have to come back to this.
[72:12.76]I don't want to fuck this up.
[72:14.98]I don't want to fuck this up.
[72:18.10]We might have to come back to this.
[72:21.84]I really want to play this.
[72:23.21]We might have to do this, like, tomorrow.
[72:25.17]I really want to play this.
[72:32.93]Hold on just a second.
[72:35.69]I am very, very confused because I remember specifically playing.
[72:42.84]I played Beautiful Joe on this system and used this memory card for like 10 seconds to test them to see if it makes sure things worked and it worked.
[73:03.20]It'll still be here.
[73:03.84]Don't spoil the experience.
[73:05.10]Yeah.
[73:08.41]Just emulate it.
[73:10.19]Alright, that's not... Just go download an ISO of five parts of Chibi-Robo and combine them illegally and then use it.
[73:17.47]That's gonna take like half an hour for me to do that.
[73:26.64]That's not something I can do right now.
[73:33.11]Every place that has emulation, the download, they like throttle your download and shit.
[73:38.66]Trust me, I know.
[73:40.08]You download from all these websites at like 600k a second.
[73:49.13]Alright.
[73:52.35]Alright, I'm ripping the Band-Aid off.
[73:53.54]I have to.
[73:54.44]The Band-Aid's coming off.
[73:56.00]I'm gonna put in Beautiful Joe.
[73:57.62]And I'm gonna see what the fuck is going on here.
[74:00.56]I'm ripping the Band-Aid off.
[74:01.34]I'll play this another day.
[74:02.26]I can't.
[74:03.22]I already love the game.
[74:04.32]I don't want to fucking tarnish it.
[74:05.44]I want to play it for real.
[74:19.80]I'm sorry.
[74:20.42]I'm sorry.
[74:20.92]I really... I'm sorry, guys.
[74:23.20]We're gonna change to something else.
[74:24.86]Give me one second.
[74:25.54]Let me just... I'm gonna put in Beautiful Joe.
[74:27.84]Beautiful Joe is fucking equally as incredible.
[74:30.19]And I think it does save to this card, because I used it.
[74:33.53]Hold on.
[74:34.17]I'll be right back.
