[00:20.31]Howdy, hello everybody.
[00:23.91]Welcome to another stream.
[00:32.04]Today... I'm gonna be playing some Split Fiction with Etalyx.
[00:44.62]Maybe some Monster Hunter later, maybe?
[00:48.06]Depends.
[00:50.31]But at the very least, gonna be doing some split fiction.
[00:53.51]Hope you all got some sleep after last night.
[00:59.69]Uh, not quite ready.
[01:00.63]We're still setting up.
[01:01.74]And, uh, ad break needs to start to get rid of the pre-rolls for the first hour.
[01:06.50]Those will be starting in a minute, hopefully.
[01:10.12]We will find out, but I will sit here and we'll see.
[01:14.78]Every single day only.
[01:16.58]Okay.
[01:20.13]That's right, guys.
[01:21.93]For every day.
[01:22.97]Now we're good.
[01:25.57]I'm just, I'm having fun.
[01:27.43]I said, you know what?
[01:27.99]I'm still having fun.
[01:29.15]I'm just doing whatever I want.
[01:31.21]And it's been great.
[01:31.95]So let's keep going.
[01:32.81]I'm just having fun.
[01:35.80]Hopefully ads start here.
[01:36.84]If they do, great.
[01:37.90]If not, then we can chill until they do.
[01:40.26]But you should expect about a few minutes of ads right now.
[01:45.10]I will be back and we'll get started.
[01:52.05]Did Daylight Savings Time mess with you?
[01:53.49]It did.
[01:53.97]It always does.
[01:54.47]But we'll see.
[01:57.67]They should be starting any second here.
[02:01.08]And then I will be right back.
[02:13.18]Omega Gaming Lifetime.
[02:26.28]Omega Gaming lifestyle.
[02:29.98]Late plus ads.
[02:31.56]No shame.
[02:36.21]Hey, well, you know.
[02:42.43]It is what it is.
[02:46.26]Late plus ads.
[02:47.90]L plus ads.
[02:52.53]Omega-3 heart-healthy gaming.
[02:54.55]Actually, that's a good title.
[02:55.71]Fuck.
[02:57.35]Maybe I should make it that.
[03:04.78]I kind of like where it is now.
[03:10.79]Stream late last night?
[03:11.55]Yeah, I went to sleep late last night, I did.
[03:18.05]Don't steal chat's jokes.
[03:19.79]I just laughed at it and I said, LOL, I should make it that.
[03:24.43]Look, you can have 7% of the title.
[03:26.98]Okay, if there's eight words in the title or something, you can have one word.
[03:31.24]Okay.
[03:34.70]Okay, if there's 10 words, you can have a seventh of one word.
[03:54.66]That's brutal.
[03:55.70]It's all good.
[04:01.61]No scary games tonight?
[04:02.67]No scary games for at least a week or two.
[04:06.69]Yeah, I woke up sore today.
[04:08.49]Like I went to the gym.
[04:18.77]It was genuinely as if I was lifting.
[04:35.93]How's my gut doing?
[04:37.83]It's not great, but it's not bad either.
[04:42.22]Could be better.
[04:44.68]I'm working on it though.
[04:47.33]I'm working on it.
[04:59.10]Alright, well, let's let people trickle in here.
[05:00.76]I'm going to take a... Ads should be starting, but sometimes it takes a while for the first ones to start.
[05:07.83]I'm going to go pee.
[05:08.53]I'm going to be ready.
[05:09.49]And then we'll get Nicole with the talics and we will go.
[05:11.21]Hopefully by the time I come back, they have already happened.
[05:14.84]Alright, ear beep.
[08:08.40]Okay, I think we're pretty much ready.
[08:10.12]Looks like they started good.
[08:13.24]Turn off those pre-rolls.
[08:14.68]I watched Harvester.
[08:23.01]Why would you ever recommend that game?
[08:24.37]I retracted that recommendation.
[08:46.42]Are you still level 18 in World of Warcraft?
[08:50.32]Um... Well, I'm level 19 and a half.
[08:59.88]Alright, I think we're in the game here.
[09:01.04]I think Etalyx is still doing his intro.
[09:06.13]Starting soon screen.
[09:08.63]Did you actually enjoy Infinity Nikki?
[09:10.33]I did!
[09:10.65]How you doing?
[09:14.35]You good?
[09:15.19]Is that a recommendation?
[09:16.87]It's good, yeah.
[09:18.27]Have you played it?
[09:18.71]I have not.
[09:22.77]It's fun.
[09:25.47]I don't know what you do.
[09:26.31]What do you do?
[09:29.43]What you do is you collect outfits.
[09:31.39]You collect bugs and you grant wishes for people and you make potions.
[09:40.50]I don't think you do that, but I'm just kind of... Let's just pretend.
[09:43.00]I don't know.
[09:44.12]Maybe you do.
[09:46.02]I like making potions.
[09:48.64]I like I like collecting outfits because I like dressing my virtual self better than my real self.
[09:55.63]Because I wear the same clothes every day in real life.
[10:00.27]Dude, it's not bad to have something that's that's not a problem.
[10:05.83]Alright, you are we ready to start split fiction?
[10:07.63]By the way, those who don't know this was made by that same studio with lead is that fuck the Oscars guy.
[10:15.74]We played A Way Out and heard this one was pretty good, so here we are.
[10:26.01]Okay, I think I'm ready to go.
[10:28.45]You're a controller guy too?
[10:32.29]I am.
[10:32.63]It did say we recommend a controller, so...
[10:37.01]Yeah, I think you have to take that seriously anytime a dev front loads the game loading in by being like, you need to play like if it's like the dev saying if I read one steam review complaining about the keyboard controls.
[10:50.28]This is a third person, right?
[10:52.18]So was it a third part?
[10:53.16]I don't know.
[10:53.51]I don't I don't know anything about this game.
[10:54.79]I just know that it's cool.
[10:56.35]I'm ready to play a cool game so.
[10:59.89]Alright, here we go.
[11:00.31]Alright, we're hopping in.
[11:01.99]Let's go.
[11:02.29]Is everybody everybody get hype?
[11:09.18]Get that fucking mouse off the screen.
[11:14.56]Is your car skipping?
[11:16.84]Okay.
[11:18.38]Oh, are we lagging already?
[11:20.47]Yeah.
[11:22.19]Mine was alright.
[11:22.91]It was bad.
[11:24.27]I had like a little stop motion animation there.
[11:26.05]Uh-oh.
[11:29.05]I think it was just loading in.
[11:33.98]So what are we, are we writers?
[11:35.08]Oh, yep.
[11:35.40]They knew you were gonna ask that.
[11:36.76]That's you, by the way.
[11:38.36]Is this me?
[11:38.58]No, like, did you not see the guy?
[12:04.29]Wait, is that you?
[12:05.17]Who's player one and who's player two?
[12:06.47]Alright, now we just turn and start fucking beating the shit out of each other.
[12:12.24]It starts, welcome to Split Fiction.
[12:13.82]We'd have to fight in the elevator.
[12:15.54]We're a way out brain because that's how we left off.
[12:20.72]It's science fiction.
[12:33.23]Oh, sci-fi.
[12:34.69]I'm more of a fantasy person.
[12:36.07]Well, actually... Alright, well, here's the thing.
[12:38.69]Are you... I'm more of a fantasy guy, I think.
[12:41.25]You're more of a sci-fi guy, aren't you?
[12:43.09]Oh.
[12:44.36]Okay.
[12:45.10]I mean, Lord of the... I like both.
[12:47.86]We should switch controllers.
[12:51.00]Nice to meet you, too.
[12:54.08]Hello.
[12:55.14]I am Raider.
[12:56.47]Owner and founder of Raider Publishing.
[12:59.60]You said you're more of a fantasy?
[13:01.87]I like swords and spells and goblins and stuff.
[13:06.15]That's true.
[13:08.62]I mean, but I would put Lord of the Rings at the top, so that's fantasy.
[13:11.42]Uh-oh.
[13:11.60]I'm missing some frames.
[13:13.30]Uh-oh.
[13:14.52]We'll see when we get into the game how it is.
[13:18.14]Track and synchronize what?
[13:35.56]Mr. Raider will fill you in on the details shortly.
[13:39.94]Why read or watch a story when you can live it?
[13:43.53]Touch it.
[13:44.83]Feel it.
[13:46.37]This guy's evil.
[13:47.47]My fellow writers.
[13:48.81]He looks like Norman Osborn.
[13:49.81]Let me introduce the machine.
[13:53.04]My life's work.
[13:54.88]The heart of this company.
[13:58.21]Now you can smell the inside of your favorite streamer's room.
[14:02.83]All those old McDonald's bags.
[14:06.27]Old cups of coke with the bottom of the fucking coke.
[14:09.43]The bottom of the cup is actually wilting away because there's coke at the bottom that you didn't dump out yet.
[14:14.27]What?
[14:14.45]She looks like Hayden Pinatier, whatever her name is.
[14:18.59]Not her.
[14:40.94]I didn't sign up for a medical procedure.
[14:42.78]I like these suits.
[14:43.30]Oh, trust me, this is no medical procedure whatsoever.
[14:46.50]Just try to relax and you'll enjoy the experience.
[14:52.20]Right.
[14:53.60]Sure.
[14:54.92]Then without further ado, activate the suits.
[15:00.73]This is so cool.
[15:03.29]Please step onto your assigned platforms.
[15:05.27]Laser tag suits.
[15:13.38]Welcome.
[15:16.83]Please step on your assigned platform.
[15:21.25]So what do we just get?
[15:22.49]I think we get beamed into different video games.
[15:24.91]I think that's kind of how this works.
[15:26.38]It's time to unleash your full creative potential.
[15:28.06]Go.
[15:42.50]This is kind of loud.
[15:44.20]This is kind of loud.
[15:44.94]It got loud, didn't it?
[15:46.02]Yeah.
[15:46.24]Why did it get so loud?
[15:52.15]I'm going to have to turn this down.
[16:00.27]Are you seeing the panicking person or are you seeing the platform?
[16:03.48]I won't do it.
[16:04.56]Okay.
[16:04.94]We cannot shut this down now.
[16:06.42]Do you understand?
[16:07.22]Why you choose right now?
[16:08.36]What?
[16:09.61]No!
[16:10.05]I said I'm out!
[16:11.03]It sounded like a fun way to get paid for science to save energy or... Envelope all your friends!
[16:18.86]Oh, we crossed the streams right at the beginning.
[16:23.24]oh okay here we go so this is the fantasy genre or this alright okay your favorite show was your chat Jerma is guy okay just in case that wasn't clear oh and I'm etel okay I didn't I didn't want you guys to get that flipped alright so but what what is your favorite what's your favorite TV show of all time you have to be the person on the right because you're older than me
[16:51.76]I like fantasy too.
[16:52.88]I told you, my favorite show is... You did say fantasy.
[16:55.58]I'll let you have fantasy.
[16:57.86]Okay.
[16:59.11]I like science fiction.
[17:00.13]Look, The Expanse, okay?
[17:02.01]The number one TV show.
[17:03.53]I could be the science fiction guy.
[17:06.87]I could see it.
[17:07.23]Alright, so what's going to happen is... You're going to press ready?
[17:12.83]What's your favorite fantasy, like... Like, what is it?
[17:17.54]Like, book, movie, TV show?
[17:20.24]It's, um...
[17:23.52]I like, uh, uh, LARPing in real life at the, uh, at the convention.
[17:28.83]Where you have, you have, like, the wizard staff in the hat.
[17:31.89]And you walk around and... ...tend to be Gandalf at the convention for, like, a few hours.
[17:40.60]OK.
[17:40.74]I mean, we're talking about fantasy.
[17:42.44]That's something I've never done, but I think would be fun.
[17:44.14]I'm going to say it would be a movie like or a video game.
[17:48.20]Oh wait, you thought it was like fantasy.
[17:50.31]Like you're a dreamer.
[17:51.29]You're like you like you like ideas like fantasy.
[17:54.67]I like that.
[17:56.65]Yeah, let's go with that.
[17:58.67]Let's go with what you just said.
[18:03.97]You're, you're a... Okay, you know what, you're the personality type on the right, is charismatic, empathetic, optimistic, extrovert, a cheerful country girl.
[18:13.48]Uh, you're famously from the countryside, I think, with that thick accent you've got.
[18:21.01]And to her family, that she's not a complete failure.
[18:23.83]Zoe hopes that this publishing deal will solve all of her problems.
[18:28.59]when you press ready we're gonna be I what let's bet that we go right into a Super Mario kind of platform level it's gonna be 2d platformer I'm gonna be real I didn't know that I had to push a button this is exactly what I'm talking about there's a stew there's a stew on the stove it's
[18:55.63]you just carry around a fireball casually because yeah I don't know if I have fire powers I'd probably do that too wait you don't get to be in a cool uh time period outfit what are you doing here hang on you're making one for me what are you doing in my story something bad is going on here
[19:23.41]Like you're ruining my chance to get published.
[19:25.79]Listen to me.
[19:26.99]Hey.
[19:28.99]What was that?
[19:30.25]Watch where you point those things.
[19:32.61]There is something this publisher is not telling us.
[19:35.40]True.
[19:36.52]Always true.
[19:37.42]Exactly what I signed up for.
[19:39.34]You don't understand.
[19:40.50]We need to get out of here.
[19:42.06]Not we.
[19:43.04]You.
[19:43.40]I need to get published.
[19:46.12]Please leave my story.
[19:47.41]So you live in your story?
[19:48.93]That's exactly what I want to do.
[19:55.57]what is that yeah and take that glitch thingy thing whatever it is with you that came with me yes and neither you or that uh-oh now we're gonna go to your your what your spaceship can't wait to get on the spaceship I don't want to be here yeah I think this is my story this isn't a spaceship it's a space station dream a little bigger
[20:26.54]This is definitely my story.
[20:32.17]Oh, mine has action.
[20:37.27]Mine has fall down.
[20:38.27]I got to turn them.
[20:42.21]Okay, I got to turn this down a little bit.
[20:45.58]What kind of a crazy story have you written?
[20:49.06]I've written the kind of story that you have an action set piece in the first 10 minutes, but then you go 30 days earlier, back to when you have to do all the exposition to build up to that, because that scene's actually the last scene that the movie ends on.
[21:01.16]True.
[21:03.24]Alright, so here we go.
[21:11.92]Oh, hold on.
[21:15.99]I can do this in real life too.
[21:20.22]How are you doing?
[21:20.94]Is it running alright?
[21:22.34]Yeah, it's running great.
[21:24.74]That did not sound confident.
[21:26.30]That was a very not confident way to say that.
[21:31.61]It's running great.
[21:34.61]Okay, there's a double jump.
[21:37.17]Is it graphic settings or do you think it's an internet connection?
[21:42.61]The graphics?
[21:43.47]Oh, I don't know.
[21:44.85]It seems like it's trying to catch up the data sometimes.
[21:47.33]Huh.
[21:50.67]Oh yeah, I'm on the right side, I believe, right?
[21:52.78]Maybe I should label it.
[22:02.87]Watch out, watch out, watch out!
[22:03.61]Dude, it's gonna fall!
[22:06.07]I think it was bait.
[22:07.27]Look at that.
[22:07.81]Duuude, no!
[22:09.19]Oh, we both died.
[22:11.12]I followed you.
[22:18.79]Okay, so we just jump towards the wall and run?
[22:25.61]Oh, Titanfall.
[22:26.81]Don't look at my screen!
[22:34.96]What?
[22:36.50]Jesus Christ, that was so loud!
[22:40.76]Okay, hold on.
[22:41.78]Okay, is there like a setting for boost all dialogue, but then
[22:48.36]gonna I'm turning the master down to there is these guys are geniuses you could turn like the dialogue volume up it might be better let's see but there's no sound effect volume it's just like overall can you double jump in real life um that'd be fun but no
[23:13.93]Alright, L3.
[23:15.03]That's a little better.
[23:16.69]It's still... Hold on.
[23:18.11]Maybe another couple of notches.
[23:19.11]It's that one thruster.
[23:22.33]It's just the loudest sound effect in the game.
[23:24.21]They just wanted to get it out of the way early.
[23:26.07]Okay.
[23:27.99]Let's see.
[23:31.21]That's better.
[23:37.39]I have to beat you.
[23:38.53]I have to win.
[23:40.61]Oh, you've got a ways to go before you make up for a way out.
[23:44.40]Alright, so, oh wait, wrong side.
[23:51.85]Are you guys sitting on the same couch?
[23:53.45]Yeah, yeah.
[23:54.25]Hey, what's up, dude?
[23:55.01]Hey, how are you?
[23:56.05]Give me a little whack in the chest.
[23:58.11]Hey, what's up?
[24:00.99]You didn't even react.
[24:02.15]Those were like way too hard, by the way.
[24:09.81]I was fighting them when I fell into your simulation.
[24:12.21]We've got company.
[24:21.80]Watch out.
[24:25.12]I'm dead.
[24:25.70]Revive me at all.
[24:26.94]Well, I'm dead again.
[24:30.42]He died again.
[24:31.10]Nice.
[24:45.53]Oh, that way.
[24:48.91]It's cool that I can look over at your screen and if I get lost, I can know where to go.
[24:52.47]I'm trying not to look at your screen because you've gotten me killed once and died once.
[24:56.78]So I'm trying to just focus on myself here.
[25:01.12]Oops.
[25:07.10]Why am I trying to make it harder for you?
[25:14.53]Clean, we're good.
[25:21.26]Is this a balancing section?
[25:22.90]I think it's balancing.
[25:23.93]Yeah, it is.
[25:24.93]No, it's not.
[25:25.37]Just fuck it.
[25:25.87]Let's go.
[25:26.65]That's actually kind of a view.
[25:34.27]Whoa.
[25:37.75]Uh, this way?
[25:40.28]By the way, for everybody in the chat, um, with a split, it's a split screen.
[25:43.70]I'm dead.
[25:45.06]Oops.
[25:47.64]This is how we used to play games when we were kids, you know?
[25:51.64]Before we had widescreen TVs.
[25:56.06]This is what the format looked like.
[25:58.89]Just half of the screen.
[26:01.09]Wait, R1?
[26:01.63]Yeah, and sometimes it was four.
[26:04.73]You had a little, tiny little TV in the corner of the screen.
[26:09.48]What would you say is the best square to have in the four-person co-op, like, GoldenEye session?
[26:13.96]I say bottom right.
[26:17.60]If you're like in the beanbag chair, then yeah, like bottom left, bottom right.
[26:21.45]If you're like the older kid who's like taller and sitting in like a real chair or like the couch, then top left or top right.
[26:30.63]Yeah, I think bottom left was the worst spot and it was actually a debuff.
[26:34.89]Like if you had bottom left and you had like two or three less kills than everybody else, that was to be expected.
[26:43.35]I'm fixing this for you.
[26:44.91]Are you turn that off?
[26:46.23]Yep, and I go through.
[26:50.17]Are you alright?
[26:53.34]Do I have to do for you?
[26:55.12]I think I'm just like on a timing game now.
[26:58.32]Nice.
[27:01.46]It was really cool of them to like.
[27:04.44]Make this game for like the iPhone generation though.
[27:08.57]Somebody said that they don't like this.
[27:10.67]They're getting confused and I should stretch my screen to fill the whole monitor.
[27:16.53]But what you don't understand is I think we're going to get some weird, interesting co-op split screen goofiness.
[27:24.29]At least that's how it was in the other one.
[27:27.97]It's supposed to be played like this.
[27:32.71]Oh, I'm so glad we got to go to my world first.
[27:35.33]I'm annoyed that I said goofiness as like a verb and didn't correct myself immediately.
[27:41.36]It's like making an old YouTube video title.
[27:45.93]It's like silly chaotic fun.
[27:48.21]Yeah.
[27:51.57]Mayhem and mischief awaits.
[27:53.13]Oops.
[27:53.29]Are you speedrunning?
[27:55.59]I was just trying to just go faster.
[27:58.45]Cool, alright.
[28:21.50]One, two, three.
[28:25.37]Oh, I see it on the screen.
[28:27.39]Oh.
[28:33.95]Nice.
[28:34.71]I thought we had to do it at the same time.
[28:37.20]Yeah, I thought it was a... Yeah, one, two, three.
[28:42.12]Oh my...
[29:00.09]Yeah, I think this would be kind of fun in... Not that, but this would be kind of fun in real life to have like a dodge the lasers.
[29:08.07]Oh, aim for the water.
[29:10.45]I'm going to hit my face on this.
[29:12.09]I'm dead.
[29:20.46]Oh, that's funny.
[29:21.12]Oh, you are not using a PlayStation controller, I see.
[29:25.21]Yeah, well, it actually has our inputs.
[29:27.08]I'm using a Microsoft official controller.
[29:31.04]PS5.
[29:32.06]PS5 for life.
[29:34.42]Oh, we're going to get in an argument here.
[29:35.60]You're an Xbox guy and I'm a PS5 guy.
[29:38.18]Can we actually get along?
[29:40.21]Uh-oh.
[29:42.05]Now where?
[29:47.67]Got him.
[29:48.81]Shit, where was that?
[29:50.07]Got him.
[29:52.31]I'm actually a PlayStation controller guy.
[29:54.43]It's just that using the PS controller on the PC just like sucks 70% of the time.
[30:01.53]It does.
[30:02.50]It does.
[30:02.96]You're right.
[30:04.44]Sometimes it doesn't get registered.
[30:05.92]Sometimes it doesn't work.
[30:07.44]That's true.
[30:08.22]But when it does work, I think the PS5 controller is the best controller.
[30:11.84]I like the layout of the Xbox One better, but let me ask you this.
[30:16.18]Do you like the clicky, clacky dog shit?
[30:18.66]It's so annoying to me.
[30:20.74]the the Xbox controllers are incredibly clicky clacky yeah I just I don't like the click the bumpers I got a I got a like lukewarm take I think that the like Nintendo Switch pro controller would be the best controller if they had actual triggers instead of like second bumpers I agree
[30:47.14]I think the Xbox layout is most comfortable, but I don't like the clicky bumpers and sometimes... Okay, I was looking at your screen.
[30:55.94]Sorry.
[30:56.22]I was just a little screwed up there.
[31:12.68]Oh, come on.
[31:13.26]I was doing so well.
[31:16.17]I'm trying to wait for you.
[31:19.25]I'm trying to dodge for you.
[31:21.89]This has got to be a team effort.
[31:24.85]Nice.
[31:29.12]That was pretty sick.
[31:33.34]So wait, are you going to drive and I shoot now?
[31:35.42]Oh yeah, let's go.
[31:36.24]This is going to be fun.
[31:40.54]OK, let's do it.
[31:43.30]Oh, the controls are inverted.
[31:46.87]I'm going, I'm going.
[31:56.33]I got it.
[31:58.23]Do you know what those Ubisoft E3 presentations have done permanently in my brain?
[32:04.76]Anytime that I'm streaming and I genuinely want to be like, hey, watch out, dude.
[32:09.18]Hey, behind you, behind you.
[32:12.28]Did you just crash?
[32:18.59]But like, doesn't that make you feel like, oh, fuck, I'm doing the E3 presentation.
[32:22.85]I can't say, watch out, behind you.
[32:25.67]Oh, dude, nice shooting.
[32:26.57]Like, I can't say that anymore.
[32:29.74]It does limit the vocabulary because the Ubisoft presentations have set us back and not being able to take, we can't play games seriously.
[32:37.86]It has to be ironic right now.
[32:43.09]Like, the more fun we're genuinely having, the worse it is, apparently.
[32:49.21]Like, those guys are having the time of their lives on those things.
[32:52.72]Let's go.
[32:53.20]Whoa, man.
[32:54.08]Watch out.
[32:54.92]Big move.
[32:55.72]And it's like, shut up.
[32:57.26]Stop having fun.
[32:59.44]Yeah, exactly.
[33:00.83]Like, I stopped taking this so seriously.
[33:02.85]It's just video games, loser.
[33:06.35]It is funny, though, but, like, sometimes it is...
[33:10.45]A lot of people don't talk to each other that way.
[33:13.29]Like most of the time it's just somebody like burps kind of loud with like a soda like burp and then there's like a dog barking and then somebody goes like, hey dude, like the fuck.
[33:21.96]So I get it.
[33:23.56]Unless you're playing like Left 4 Dead co-op on the highest difficulty, most multiplayer gaming is just people just sitting there going.
[33:33.48]Yeah.
[33:33.62]It's most people just doing like like airy soda burps into their microphones and like agreeing with where we're going to go next.
[33:44.08]Now we're in my world.
[33:45.08]I'm going to pause real quick.
[33:55.70]I'm just going to turn the dialogue to the maximum volume.
[33:58.91]Maybe I should do that too.
[34:03.51]Because I keep the reason I crash is because I'm having to adjust the volume every third.
[34:08.05]Like, are you the remote guy?
[34:10.19]I'm the remote guy.
[34:12.22]yep where you're the quarterback of the entire uh where if that's too loud you preemptively get ready to turn it down before the loud thing happens and then you have to turn it back up yeah you just hold the remote for the entire movie and you just keep up down up down and anytime like an actual loud noise happens you have to apologize to the other people who are watching I I I missed that one that's on me yeah it sucks
[34:40.81]And it sucks even more when there's an indicator on the TV screen that it's being done.
[34:45.25]So it's like, oh, look, you're taking the immersion out of when Thanos is here.
[34:48.93]Because you just have to... I just saw volume down, down, down, down, down, down.
[34:52.64]What the fuck?
[34:54.82]Don't run into the ogres.
[34:57.38]Oh, okay.
[35:01.30]What happens if I... Wait, where are you going?
[35:04.14]You're dead.
[35:05.78]Do you come back?
[35:08.84]I just got killed by a rock that fell from a stage light.
[35:11.48]What the fuck was that?
[35:14.32]I just wanted to see what would happen, okay?
[35:16.42]I'm done pushing the boundaries.
[35:25.73]Now this is a Mario segment.
[35:28.25]Oh, yeah.
[35:29.11]That's what I'm talking about.
[35:29.97]I'm so glad to be in my element here.
[35:47.01]It's a running away from the camera segment.
[35:49.83]So far, this feels kind of like a fun theme park ride.
[35:54.04]I feel like I'm on a fun ride right now.
[35:57.70]What?
[35:58.12]Excuse me?
[35:59.72]What the fuck was that?
[36:14.23]you weren't you weren't ready for like the ogre that got sucked into the drain pipe at like extremely high pressure what what what's the uh what's the word for that again uh uh depressurization oh my god depressurization no it's not that one delta p somebody in delta p yeah that's the one
[36:45.79]Alright.
[36:47.11]You're no, you're crazy.
[36:50.53]When we get a sword.
[36:51.97]Don't forget who created this mess when you crashed into my simulation.
[36:58.89]I like this is a cool area.
[37:00.81]That's true.
[37:01.25]This is technically all my fault for getting into your bubble.
[37:05.39]Yeah.
[37:07.72]I was trying to write my cool story with my ogres and stuff and you.
[37:11.41]But what if this is like an evil organization who's trying to keep us contained in a coma and they can just use our imagination to co-opt their own stories as a major publisher who has run out of ideas?
[37:23.59]It's probably going to be what it is.
[37:25.39]This is a puzzle, so I want you to do all the work.
[37:27.69]So go ahead.
[37:28.61]Okay.
[37:34.03]I actually think you might.
[37:35.41]I think that is correct.
[37:42.85]Yeah, you just have to sneak through.
[37:43.77]Maybe I should put like an E and a J on the screen.
[37:52.26]Because I feel like people are trickling in and asking about it.
[37:55.14]Okay.
[37:57.78]Yeah, I'm on the right.
[38:01.50]Maybe when we take a break, I'll throw it up there probably.
[38:03.71]Or you could put it in the title too.
[38:06.63]Or, yeah, it don't matter.
[38:10.83]Dude, I recognize this part.
[38:15.30]We did the Assassin's Creed thing.
[38:19.66]I was thinking Kingdom Come Deliverance, but that's good too.
[38:26.25]Something's up ahead.
[38:29.97]Alright, I think this is our first real battle.
[38:39.14]So I think we sneak.
[38:40.18]Is there a sneak button?
[38:40.88]Do we need a death counter?
[38:43.87]Oh, we could have a death counter.
[38:45.63]I don't have it set up.
[38:47.21]I don't know if anybody can keep track.
[38:51.78]Jeez, what the fuck?
[38:53.24]Oh, plus one.
[38:58.26]It's homing.
[39:00.18]Oh, one of us has to die.
[39:01.68]One of us has to die, yeah.
[39:05.43]Wait, what's this?
[39:07.63]Oh, I can distract him.
[39:13.73]Gotta distract the other one.
[39:15.25]I can't distract... Hold on.
[39:16.59]Let me distract this one.
[39:18.43]Yeah, yeah.
[39:18.87]Distract that.
[39:20.01]It goes... Actually, it is homing.
[39:22.11]It kills you.
[39:22.86]Alright, so ready?
[39:24.18]Go.
[39:27.80]Excellent.
[39:28.90]Okay, well... Wait, what?
[39:30.68]But I'm here.
[39:31.40]Okay.
[39:31.96]Ready?
[39:33.60]Go.
[39:35.87]Wait, why... Why would I distract him over here?
[39:38.33]Wait.
[39:40.03]Oh, wait, wait.
[39:40.73]This is an army of two segment.
[39:43.69]I'm supposed to be on the other side.
[39:44.95]Oh, we're not.
[39:46.55]We're not supposed to be together.
[39:47.55]Let's go.
[39:53.81]Can you?
[39:54.39]Alright, let me.
[39:56.41]Go ahead.
[39:59.15]Alright, so.
[40:01.47]Oh, no, we don't have to sacrifice ourselves at all.
[40:04.74]We're just that noble.
[40:06.98]So you distracted this one for no reason.
[40:09.68]And then I distracted this one.
[40:13.42]and then and then we go then we go oh look at that you guys need to split fiction that's true so is the irony gonna be that the publisher in this game is stealing our ideas but this game is using ideas from every other game
[40:42.42]Um, I, we're probably going somewhere there.
[40:44.51]Um, okay, then.
[40:50.53]Oh shit, I just cut that guy's arm.
[40:54.79]You just, did you just guillotine somebody?
[40:57.19]I believe, I think it was an arm.
[40:59.55]Okay, but if, do you think that if these, if these ogres are virtual, but it's real to us.
[41:07.42]Do you think it hurts?
[41:07.96]You know what I mean?
[41:09.36]Yeah, the...
[41:11.12]Do you think it hurts them?
[41:13.28]Hmm.
[41:20.05]Well, couldn't you say the same thing about any in-game character?
[41:22.85]Like our... They're programmed to feel the pain.
[41:35.68]But if you don't feel pain, are you really alive?
[41:40.54]Hmm.
[41:44.05]Yeah.
[41:46.21]There's a lot of organisms that don't have the nervous system capability, but they're alive.
[42:00.06]Do they?
[42:00.58]If they don't know they're alive, are they alive?
[42:02.36]He still got us.
[42:15.26]It's dash.
[42:20.48]No, I wanted to dash.
[42:22.04]I saw, okay, I saw X pop up on your screen and I'm pressing X on my controller, which is jump for me.
[42:28.69]This is not going to work out.
[42:33.07]Go!
[42:38.63]I'm so far behind.
[42:41.45]You're right.
[42:41.81]You're right here.
[42:42.30]You're right here.
[42:50.39]alright we did it we made it holy that was a close call oh no are we in another one of your stories this looks like a uh wild star raid something else then what is this place it does kind of look like wild star doesn't it whatever it is
[43:17.74]I think the glitch has something to do with it.
[43:21.35]Yeah, it's acting weird.
[43:23.35]The game is quiet.
[43:32.29]It's quiet and then it's loud.
[43:34.19]Yeah.
[43:35.65]I don't know.
[43:40.29]Can you hear that?
[43:41.75]I turned the dialogue up all the way pretty much.
[43:50.12]Listen, no one can ever hear dialogue anyway.
[43:51.82]That's why we use subtitles these days.
[43:53.70]It's true.
[43:55.48]It seems like their combined presence overloaded the entire system, causing it to glitch.
[43:59.58]This is not supposed to happen.
[44:01.00]Can't we stop them?
[44:02.80]We don't know yet, but we need to find a solution before the machine takes damage.
[44:07.85]Damn it.
[44:09.47]What's the status of the other participants?
[44:11.57]All stable.
[44:12.65]So do we invade all these other people's dreams?
[44:14.83]Except these two.
[44:19.26]I don't know, but what if one of these guys is playing like a porn game?
[44:21.85]Yeah, I don't want to do that.
[44:27.80]I mean, there's a significant number of, these are all writers, right?
[44:31.46]Like statistically two of these writers.
[44:34.84]or like romance or smut novelist, you know what I mean?
[44:37.52]A second ago, we were happy in our own world.
[44:39.92]We didn't want to get out.
[44:41.13]Let's just...
[45:00.05]live here do we have to eat more of them I believe it might crash the whole system do we have to in here I don't know how much I I you know upload your consciousness thing my crazy stories do you think I'm excited
[45:14.70]There would need to be a lineage that I would trust the key to that with.
[45:18.24]Because I don't want my, like, a little cube of my conscience in, like, a box that somebody can just fucking keep.
[45:23.87]No, there needs to be a... I need to vet, like, a 100... Like, a 100-year-long lineage of just somebody that is the keeper of that, and I trust them completely.
[45:34.93]I feel like I would want it to be... It would have to have some kind of encryption that nobody could ever, like, copy-paste it, you know what I mean?
[45:42.05]Yeah.
[45:43.89]What if you get old as that consciousness and you're like, I'm ready to go.
[45:46.83]It's been 800,000 years.
[45:48.88]And then somebody just re-uploads you to Dropbox.
[45:52.24]No, just turn me into a tree.
[45:53.68]Fuck all that.
[45:54.54]Fuck all this.
[45:55.68]When I die, just make me a tree.
[45:57.58]Make me like a big apple tree.
[46:01.62]I'm not getting uploaded to a computer.
[46:03.02]No, fuck that.
[46:07.18]Grind me up into dust and make me fertilizer.
[46:09.48]I'm sorry.
[46:13.25]I wrote this a couple years ago.
[46:19.48]They probably got this from my live journal.
[46:20.96]What about people eating those apples?
[46:23.54]Fuck.
[46:25.14]What's a non-food?
[46:29.89]Yeah, that's weird.
[46:32.61]What?
[46:43.32]If I was turned into an apple tree, people would be able to eat the apples.
[46:46.34]That's kind of weird, isn't it?
[46:47.12]Yeah, kind of.
[46:51.54]They could also, like, chop the bark off the tree.
[46:54.96]Yeah, don't do that either.
[46:56.10]Leave me alone.
[46:58.88]They could also, like, pave concrete all around the tree, so your tree struggles to get its roots to continue to spread, you know?
[47:07.91]so we have we're like what's going on this friendly fire catch me if you can bitch alright got you hey I went
[47:30.96]Oh, so we have melee attack now.
[47:33.34]I think you have to touch that one.
[47:34.48]I think this is... Is this your world?
[47:38.40]You're just passing through.
[47:39.26]Oh, okay.
[47:41.78]I have these... I have the power.
[47:43.22]Yeah, you've got the physics.
[47:44.92]Ooh, okay.
[47:49.88]The tree will rot and grow again.
[47:51.44]Energy cannot be created or destroyed.
[47:53.20]That person would not... That was a really... Ooh.
[47:57.12]Ooh.
[48:02.52]Okay, we're sideways to each other.
[48:09.88]I saw the purple and assumed I couldn't do it.
[48:14.82]What do I do with this?
[48:15.58]I can drag this?
[48:17.40]I need like a platform.
[48:19.04]Okay, there you go.
[48:20.70]Now I'm gonna pull you.
[48:22.21]You just have to watch out for the laser field.
[48:24.41]Oh shit, that thing?
[48:25.09]Go, go, go.
[48:31.25]Nice.
[48:31.41]Alright.
[48:31.77]Good.
[48:39.91]Maybe you need to get out of the way.
[48:42.99]It's four boxes.
[48:47.41]Jesus.
[48:48.03]What happened?
[48:49.89]You can't touch the green goo.
[48:59.02]I didn't know if I could put the crates down.
[49:07.81]Oh, you were trying to like put a crate in the middle and like jump over it?
[49:10.79]Yeah, I was trying to use the environment.
[49:13.37]Weirdo!
[49:13.81]Why are you attacking the Star Wars vacuum droid?
[49:19.22]Because he didn't make a cute sound immediately, so therefore he is an enemy.
[49:25.92]That's true.
[49:26.56]They do have to like be boop a little bit.
[49:30.64]Yeah, if they don't go.
[49:34.18]Or then they're a bad.
[49:36.54]They're a bad guy.
[49:40.50]What about the ones that sound like?
[49:42.80]Like Alan Tudyk.
[49:46.96]Like what?
[49:49.98]Isn't that isn't that who voices the one in Rogue One?
[49:53.98]Oh, I was OK for I was like, wait, what?
[49:56.30]What?
[49:56.52]What?
[49:56.74]Who is this?
[50:01.28]You have to break his name.
[50:02.38]I don't know what his name is.
[50:04.16]They get it right.
[50:06.04]I think you're right.
[50:06.52]I just go across Alan Alan Tuna.
[50:13.28]Those people say an Alan tunic.
[50:17.73]It's tunic.
[50:19.29]Tudyk.
[50:24.70]Hey, how'd you get over there?
[50:27.08]Uh, my gravity defying powers.
[50:30.80]I think I need you to destroy this.
[50:33.32]Okay, so I break it, so on.
[50:34.62]Alright, I'm ready.
[50:38.75]Nice.
[50:39.01]You are walking on the walls and it's freaking me out.
[50:45.91]How?
[50:46.03]Wait.
[50:54.29]Where are you?
[50:54.85]I'm on the ceiling.
[51:02.64]That's kind of freaky.
[51:03.38]I look at your screen and it's going to make me want to puke.
[51:15.77]Okay, so... I wrote this story because society has fallen.
[51:19.25]Thank you.
[51:21.89]I will rebuild it.
[51:24.00]with plasma swords.
[51:31.88]Excellent.
[51:32.76]Wait, yeah, maybe I'm the one on the ceiling.
[51:39.79]Is this...
[51:50.28]okay I was wondering if that was like traditional hot video game steam you know that like kills you oh my goodness okay and then Alan tudyk is the pirate guy in dodgeball
[52:21.93]Are you, uh, would whip be your first choice of weapon in this situation?
[52:26.69]Are you the whip guy?
[52:29.24]Um... I don't know if it would be first choice.
[52:33.90]I'd be too afraid that I would accidentally hit myself in the face with it and like all my front teeth would come out.
[52:42.14]Have you ever, have you ever snapped a whip in real life?
[52:44.66]Yeah, it's horrifying.
[52:46.14]It is.
[52:47.61]That's what I'm saying.
[52:48.85]I would be like, spin around, spin around, spin around, crack!
[52:53.27]And I would just spank myself in the ass and have a welt for six months.
[52:58.69]Somehow, it would be bad.
[52:59.75]Alright, I have to... On the next truck, give me five seconds to get a truck.
[53:09.35]I don't know what I did, but I'm just hanging here.
[53:15.61]Come on, OK, good.
[53:28.80]Nice dude, nice.
[53:29.76]I'm pumping it, but I don't know why.
[53:33.00]Oh, I launch you.
[53:34.34]Oh you do OK.
[53:38.34]Oh, that's cool.
[53:38.86]So how do I do to you?
[53:41.45]Oh, you throw boxes at me.
[53:50.62]OK, is this something for me to latch on to?
[53:54.52]Can you wait?
[53:55.57]Maybe there's something I throw this at?
[53:57.57]Can I throw the thing you're hitting?
[53:58.57]Oh wait, hold on, hold on.
[54:04.79]What about what about the to the right that truck?
[54:10.95]Does that look like you can do it?
[54:12.77]You have to break it first.
[54:14.23]I have to break it.
[54:16.13]Oh, this glass.
[54:17.15]I didn't even see the glass.
[54:18.13]Somebody just called us an idiot.
[54:20.37]Someone called us an idiot?
[54:21.87]Yeah.
[54:23.37]We are in the same bubble orb right now, so I guess that tracks.
[54:29.37]How do I get over there?
[54:30.15]I'm sorry.
[54:35.70]Maybe I have to go further?
[54:36.92]Oh, wait.
[54:38.90]Here we go.
[54:43.61]Oh, you got like a crane hook arm?
[54:45.45]I guess I can pull this so you can... Can you jump onto that?
[54:51.18]No, do you have to pull me back the other way?
[54:52.48]Yeah, and then you can go to the truck.
[54:57.56]I got a swing.
[54:58.18]Hey, whoever called us an idiot, ban that guy.
[55:06.43]You just killed that guy.
[55:10.13]He's got a parachute.
[55:13.37]Oh my God, that's you OK.
[55:21.01]Whoa, that was moving.
[55:25.09]I didn't know there was a ladder in front.
[55:27.19]That's what we got to get the Ubisoft dialogue.
[55:30.83]OK, yeah, we gotta let's get some Ubisoft communication here.
[55:33.17]Alright, so I'm going in front.
[55:35.91]Keep it right where it is.
[55:36.60]Alright, I'm good.
[55:38.62]I don't know how to get out of this.
[55:43.34]Can I pull it?
[55:45.44]Oh.
[55:48.47]Yeah, actually, I'm glad I'm not your game right now because you're playing the game upside down, kind of.
[55:56.01]Yeah, I have to move the truck to the left so it's higher than this truck so I can, like, move over here.
[56:00.79]Alright, grabbing onto the pink gravity.
[56:03.58]Hopping across the cars.
[56:04.44]I think we're both here now, yeah.
[56:07.20]Ooh, okay.
[56:18.69]I like okay I like the game so far has been cool because I feel like it's just a bunch of like little fun little jumpy things we're playing um a series of relentless Mario Party minigames back to back yeah I I vibe with this
[56:47.08]This is like endless mode in Mario Party Anniversary.
[56:51.42]What do I do?
[56:53.17]Oh, okay, I can pull down this one.
[56:54.69]So now I think you can get over there now.
[56:56.61]Sometimes I don't see where I'm supposed to grab onto for the gravity.
[56:59.71]I think if the developers had outlined it in yellow, that really would have helped.
[57:05.74]Also, do you have an ad break coming up in like three, four minutes?
[57:09.86]I do, yeah.
[57:10.80]Okay, good.
[57:12.60]We synchronized our watches today, guys, to make sure that we could do this.
[57:15.84]Hold that there.
[57:18.00]I don't know what I'm supposed to do, though.
[57:21.82]If I grab it?
[57:23.68]Can you grab it when it's down?
[57:25.32]Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[57:26.32]I see.
[57:29.08]There's a ladder.
[57:33.98]Oh, now I can do that.
[57:37.22]Oh, you knew I was going to do that.
[57:38.36]I knew you were going to do it, so I dodged.
[57:40.66]You got away with it.
[57:41.58]OK.
[57:47.71]And I move this up here.
[57:48.97]Yeah.
[57:50.89]Ladders are yellow.
[57:51.77]What other color are they supposed to be?
[57:55.51]You're on the other side of this.
[57:56.77]Alright, so I'm.
[58:00.18]I'm in a different spot than you.
[58:02.66]Have you ever seen a ladder that isn't yellow?
[58:06.58]In a video game?
[58:08.02]Just in real life.
[58:10.22]Um, I yeah, I think a lot of them.
[58:14.57]You see a lot of ladders.
[58:16.57]no now that you mention it not really that's true I I guess I bought one of those um what do they call like the little giant ladder and it's like a tiny ladder yeah and you can turn it into like eight different ladders okay it turns into eight different ones yeah it turns into like ten different ladders and yes I've pinched my finger on it like a dozen times
[58:55.57]Co-op door moment.
[59:10.30]Are we getting like arrested in our own video game universe?
[59:14.52]Or wait, is this the company that's mad about this?
[59:17.19]Yeah, I'm a lawful good writer, so...
[59:21.88]Authorities have a lot of power in my universe.
[59:24.70]Shooting segment.
[59:25.84]What killed me?
[59:51.90]Why are you solving a puzzle?
[59:52.92]Yeah, that was weird.
[59:55.28]Why did I have another thing on the screen?
[60:03.62]Shooting!
[60:04.85]Stunning!
[60:11.03]Stupid screen!
[60:12.69]Like everyone is doing the same screen.
[60:25.76]I don't know why I... It actually... He said, got your six.
[60:35.01]Alright, you... You want to take a break here in a minute?
[60:39.57]Yeah.
[60:41.87]Your screams are so loud.
[60:51.26]Hey.
[60:51.34]Grab these boxes.
[60:51.98]Can I not kill this thing?
[60:53.20]Grab these boxes in the air.
[60:54.70]Oh, and then throw them.
[61:00.34]Rabbit.
[61:01.90]Oh my God, he's unloading his entire fucking clip on me.
[61:05.04]I know it's OK.
[61:08.10]Sorry they didn't kill that guy faster.
[61:13.54]Any covering fire?
[61:25.48]I think I should.
[61:26.04]We should snooze the ads here.
[61:31.67]How much time you got?
[61:32.33]I got 20 seconds.
[61:33.61]I also have 20 seconds.
[61:36.13]If you want to find out what happens in this exciting action moment.
[61:43.17]Alright, I'll snooze it.
[61:44.26]I snoozed him.
[61:44.92]Wait till we get to the end of the section.
[61:46.28]We'll be fine.
[61:50.48]If you want to find out what happens.
[61:51.82]Do they get to the end?
[61:53.66]That would actually be kind of funny.
[62:10.96]We're gonna be playing this game episodically together, one hour a day.
[62:18.54]That was the whole stream.
[62:19.40]I hope you guys enjoyed it.
[62:24.83]Ow!
[62:26.95]Was that really necessary?
[62:30.51]Oh, stop complaining.
[62:33.11]Come on, let's progress the story.
[62:34.73]Uh, Mio?
[62:38.83]What is that?
[62:41.85]Oh, I'm Miel.
[62:42.57]What is your name?
[62:44.67]I don't know.
[62:45.07]I have no idea what this character's name is.
[62:46.71]Zoe, apparently.
[62:48.05]You know what?
[62:49.81]These characters are fitting.
[62:51.03]You are the one that would just go through the portal.
[62:54.65]I mean, I'd be like, wait, I don't know if that's a good idea.
[63:09.85]if you went to the grocery store with one of these suits on like would that would be weird but what if you went to the grocery store with one of these suits on and there was a portal inside the like freezer section hey if you see somebody at like the oat milk section wearing one of these are you just like what is that what's going on here
[63:30.04]did you ever have an experience like as a little kid in the grocery store and you were like opening one of the like cold or freezer section aisle doors and then like the milk suddenly moved and you it's like you couldn't you didn't know people were back there like moving around yeah it's kind of like a like a magical world back there especially when you're younger it's sometimes you'll see like this movement who's what's going on back there
[63:57.25]This might be better to show and not tell.
[64:01.76]I'm already regretting this.
[64:05.40]Writing catchphrases.
[64:07.94]Oh, this is cool.
[64:09.04]Alright.
[64:09.48]Let me actually turn this up.
[64:18.64]Raider isn't just stealing all of our stories.
[64:21.17]Do we want to get started on this segment or do we want to... Okay, he's gone.
[64:24.89]Oh, shit.
[64:25.27]Sorry.
[64:26.84]What do you have on your time?
[64:29.38]Two and a half minutes.
[64:31.12]Yeah, we'll EQ it up.
[64:38.41]Glad those sharks are dead.
[64:40.25]They don't look friendly.
[64:41.61]Yeah, those are dead.
[64:47.91]Yellow.
[64:48.91]Good.
[64:49.25]I can finally see where I'm going.
[64:52.87]I actually didn't know until you said that.
[64:59.22]Oh.
[65:02.12]Oh, what a disaster that was.
[65:04.36]Alright, you want to take a few minutes?
[65:19.73]I'm going to get new water too.
[65:24.35]Alright, we're back in like four minutes or so.
[65:29.24]I want to get up and move around.
[65:30.74]And we get the ads going to play.
[65:33.58]How do you like it so far?
[65:34.30]I actually like it.
[65:36.22]Oh, yeah, it's really fun.
[65:37.52]We're just talking over everything because that's what you expect us to do.
[65:42.87]Yeah, unfortunately, I do a lot of yapping, as the kids say these days, right?
[65:52.37]But no, it's cool.
[65:54.31]I'm assuming they're starting us out with the easy stuff.
[65:58.71]and then it's gonna get more like the the split screen factor hasn't played in yet yeah I've seen some clips that look really weird so we'll see it's fun whatever I'm just we're just hanging out playing it's fun just to hang out uh drac see you in let's call it three or four minutes okay
[66:33.98]I'm still here.
[66:37.88]I'm getting up in 30 seconds or so.
[66:40.42]There we go.
[66:42.17]Alright, now I'm actually going to go.
[70:39.27]I am back.
[70:49.44]Welcome back.
[70:50.80]Hello.
[70:51.76]We I just got back.
[70:54.28]Very good.
[70:56.22]Perfect timing.
[70:57.04]Alright, so you ready to keep it going?
[71:02.52]Yes.
[71:06.70]Okay, I'm good.
[71:09.37]Alright, so let's do it.
[71:15.51]So do we have any different mechanics?
[71:19.04]I don't have my laser whip anymore.
[71:23.10]Yeah, we're gonna have to find out what would like you bring to the table from a writing perspective.
[71:31.25]Like I wrote that laser whip for you.
[71:37.18]It'd be funny if, um, one of these, um, like your screen's just blank because you don't have anything written for you.
[71:42.24]Sands of Time?
[71:43.40]I played that game.
[71:44.16]What the fuck?
[71:44.76]Alright, now I go.
[72:08.88]Should I get in this?
[72:12.06]Uh, I think one of us has to distract the monster.
[72:19.71]All the thumpers.
[72:23.13]Alright, you ready?
[72:25.35]Yep.
[72:27.79]Uh, I ran out.
[72:32.36]Oh shit, actually I was going.
[72:36.88]You ready?
[72:38.82]Go.
[72:44.30]OK, I can't wait to see Denise next masterpiece.
[72:51.85]It's on to you seriously.
[72:57.73]I feel like that's not the reaction you would have to nearly being killed by a monster.
[73:03.80]Yeah, do you think we feel the pain of death every time we die in this virtual environment?
[73:10.59]Probably just passing through fishies.
[73:14.67]I must say, seeing this idea come to life is pretty unexpected.
[73:19.62]Yeah, alright, ready?
[73:22.58]Better prepare for surprises indeed.
[73:25.86]Wait, we should do this together or do we just have it?
[73:27.88]It's just I think you just have to button mash at the same time.
[73:30.36]Let's do it.
[73:33.69]But I can see when you stop button mashing to leave me button mashing by myself.
[73:38.62]That's true.
[73:39.24]I was concerned.
[73:40.18]I didn't know how it worked.
[73:44.38]Do you think this game would be cool with like 3D glasses?
[73:47.42]That sounds good.
[73:48.00]I feel like I'm on like a cool ride.
[73:49.72]Oops.
[73:58.84]Oh, please don't eat me.
[74:11.12]I was trying to I was trying to block it here.
[74:13.04]Why are we in an hourglass?
[74:14.92]Oh, you know it's like they say time heals all wounds.
[74:18.46]And what about the sharks then?
[74:20.60]I haven't figured that out yet, but they are exciting.
[74:26.43]Have you seen Dune?
[74:27.11]Wait, what is it?
[74:30.63]Have you seen Dune?
[74:31.73]No, I have not.
[74:36.58]OK chat, you know what to do.
[74:37.92]Take it from here.
[74:39.52]What is that bad?
[74:44.84]I just got -2 millennial points.
[74:53.97]Watch Dune now.
[74:54.99]Yeah, people are very upset about this.
[74:57.09]Oh yeah, people like the... The Dune fan base, like rabid piranhas.
[75:03.33]And when they hear someone hasn't seen it, there's blood in the water.
[75:09.22]Okay, I'll watch it.
[75:11.06]Is that the one?
[75:11.90]I'm thinking of Tremors.
[75:15.56]That's a very different experience.
[75:23.95]Oh, cool.
[75:24.41]A driving segment.
[75:29.44]I just crashed.
[75:30.00]I'm glad you watched me do that because I feel like you were about to do the same thing.
[75:34.36]Yeah, I did.
[75:37.24]Okay.
[75:37.72]You have to grab on.
[75:38.74]You did the same thing.
[75:39.90]Same thing.
[75:40.50]You have to grab on again afterward.
[75:43.49]It's all good.
[75:56.26]Yeah, there we are.
[75:57.68]Alright.
[76:02.08]So if the fences don't stop the sandworms, are those just to stop us?
[76:06.78]Like, who built those?
[76:09.24]Yeah, they're to prevent us from getting over there.
[76:15.32]Maybe people ride these in this universe.
[76:40.61]Did she say chat's freaking out?
[76:45.42]She's streaming.
[76:47.06]They're kind of chill right now, actually.
[76:50.26]Keep going!
[77:05.40]that's why she's pissed about having to split the screen because like I'm on your other her other monitor now instead of being able to reach out so wait we have to are we starting over again dude welcome to the Blade Runner segment if there is a giant Ana de Armas in this one too
[77:35.51]I guess so.
[77:36.09]I hope they got the rights to, like, her specifically.
[77:52.17]Okay, so back here.
[77:53.01]There's a section for you.
[77:53.99]I'm going.
[77:54.49]You're just gonna have to wait until I figure out what I'm supposed to chop.
[78:20.67]Can I grab those?
[78:21.35]Wait, I think you're.
[78:25.91]Kick them over here.
[78:28.05]I opened something for you.
[78:31.23]Oh yeah, I got grabbed out of there.
[78:37.79]Yeah, and I already opened up the other side, so you should just be able to go straight through.
[78:42.85]Very good, very nice.
[78:47.18]Can I have another one?
[78:49.20]no I just walked up the edge oh hold on teamwork you stay over there that works too what should I do with it go back that way go back over there okay and then look left and right okay up up here
[79:19.78]Oh.
[79:31.77]Listen, I think too many people are focused on dialogue.
[79:34.99]Back in my day, the gameplay was king, okay?
[79:38.05]What happened to that?
[79:41.13]I think, you know, what the major issue is, is dialogue was not really in a whole lot of games.
[79:48.76]That's true.
[79:49.58]You know, like, think about how many lines Crash Bandicoot had.
[79:52.30]Yeah.
[79:52.74]Crash Bandicoot went like, and that was pretty much all he said.
[79:57.29]Like, wow!
[79:59.71]Mario says byahoo, Luigi says like, oh no!
[80:04.32]And we kind of went from that to like 400 pages of movie script.
[80:08.04]That's a boomer rant?
[80:23.53]Prince of Persia sands of time is from when I was a kid That train is gonna kill us I guarantee it
[80:46.14]I do prefer the kind of Dark Souls route.
[80:49.42]Oh my god!
[80:53.68]That was way too late.
[80:54.66]Do it again.
[80:55.20]No, no, no.
[80:57.94]The Dark Souls route?
[80:59.60]The Dark Souls route of when... When you have... I tried to do a joke there and I got scared.
[81:08.00]I'm dead.
[81:13.24]um where characters talk and they kind of give you everything that you want to get out of them the in one setting in one sitting when you see them you like the the exposition notes I feel like do we go do we follow the arrow or do we follow the train I don't know I'll go I'm gonna go this way if I die I'm gonna I think that's wrong you got I think this is wrong salute
[81:43.56]Thank God there's no, like, tunnel subway in Las Vegas.
[81:46.76]Yeah, I like when a character tells you a bunch of stuff.
[81:57.03]But... Did we get killed?
[81:58.35]What?
[81:59.49]Okay, I think... Don't move left or right.
[82:01.31]I think we have to stay dead center.
[82:15.11]I don't think I have a skullcap anymore.
[82:23.78]Like you would just pull my body aside and it would just been a bottom row of teeth.
[82:26.84]What is this?
[82:37.81]Are you playing radio?
[82:40.09]I think this is me turning different stations.
[82:46.43]Why are they swearing so much?
[83:00.89]What the fuck?
[83:01.71]That hurt.
[83:04.50]What an idiot.
[83:05.52]How do you not know how to sit in a chair?
[83:06.82]Is this an away out?
[83:08.64]Why are we so stupid?
[83:10.88]Wasn't there a competition to see who could stay balanced in a chair?
[83:15.86]Oh, do we have to hold it? ...
[83:33.98]I think they're just making fun of us for, like, just because you can destroy something, you do.
[83:38.82]Mm-hmm.
[83:39.34]Just to see if anything, like, drops.
[83:42.88]This is really pretty.
[83:44.17]Fucking love techno.
[83:44.81]Yeah, but I much prefer when a character just says, like,
[83:59.78]Oh, yes.
[84:00.57]Oh, don't go in there.
[84:01.89]That place is scary, scary.
[84:03.85]Look out.
[84:04.61]Oh, yes.
[84:06.44]And that's it.
[84:06.78]Yeah, but I would like... And you know that guy's crazy.
[84:08.96]If there were, like, Super Mario minigames all the way through.
[84:25.68]Like, if Elden Ring let me double jump, I'd play it.
[84:27.38]Oh, that's great, because you can.
[84:28.58]I'm just kidding.
[84:29.12]I knew you were going to say that.
[84:47.63]when when when are we gonna get the Etalyx Elden Ring playthrough because what the heck is going on with you bro what the heck man not okay not having played out the ring is like not playing not watching doom why is it wait we're just jumping this is like in a club John wick segment
[85:18.09]Hold on, where do you swing next?
[85:26.64]I like how the music is just like...
[85:45.00]Is there anybody else like this?
[85:46.79]I can't operate in an environment like this.
[85:51.01]Hearing the like... I love that.
[85:59.46]Oh, it's your job.
[86:02.00]I had to do it.
[86:03.92]Oh.
[86:05.48]You go.
[86:12.11]then I think do you did you watch that whoa electrifying okay do you think could you name three songs on the like top 10 music charts that's like current modern day uh I think that was a banger
[86:40.28]Because I don't think I could name one.
[86:44.60]I don't know.
[86:45.01]I don't know anything about music anymore.
[86:48.17]As I load up like the Grateful Dead live two hour long fire on the mountain session and just sit there and vibe to it.
[86:56.87]She's a ruthless psychopath who kills for fun.
[87:00.97]That sounds like a real gem.
[87:02.03]I just listened to, like, the Oblivion film soundtrack and just imagined what it would be like to be Tom Cruise on, like, a distant world with many of my clones just out of sight.
[87:12.16]That's good, too.
[87:14.14]Well, well, well.
[87:18.08]Look what the cat dragged in.
[87:22.54]Are you finally here to pay your debt?
[87:25.25]You're not getting shit.
[87:26.99]I decide when your shit is paid.
[87:30.24]And until the mortgage is secured, your ass belongs to me.
[87:37.23]What is she talking about, Mia?
[87:38.41]That's like half a Gilmore.
[87:39.69]I just wrote her as a flat, greedy villain.
[87:42.09]I ate pieces of shit like you for breakfast.
[87:44.01]You ate pieces of shit for breakfast?
[87:46.07]Say hello to Mr. Hammer.
[87:48.45]Hello, Mr. Hammer.
[87:53.56]Oh, dear.
[88:01.58]Oh, they fly now?
[88:03.84]Okay.
[88:04.44]You're at a big advantage because I... I think that's purple.
[88:12.41]You have to touch that.
[88:15.11]I got it.
[88:19.13]I got zapped.
[88:32.53]Or maybe if one of us dies, is the other one already dying?
[88:36.04]I don't know.
[88:38.76]He's got a big health bar, though.
[88:42.10]Good.
[88:51.93]Can I grab it?
[88:53.77]Throw it at him.
[88:59.00]God, have some mercy.
[89:01.99]Make it rain.
[89:04.68]Make it rain.
[89:05.56]No.
[89:10.48]Make it rain.
[89:16.10]Why?
[89:17.06]I'll earn my paycheck.
[89:21.35]What kind of club are we at?
[89:27.57]Get in.
[89:28.29]I'm trying.
[89:34.81]58 snitches.
[89:36.63]I don't think I can hurt him.
[89:45.53]That's a lot actually.
[89:47.09]I'm dying.
[90:08.30]This is not okay!
[90:13.66]Do you have a ranged attack?
[90:16.72]Uh, I have the grab.
[90:19.18]Can I throw them into each other?
[90:20.65]Oh, you saved me.
[90:27.49]I figured out how to win.
[90:31.97]Hey, those breeze were expensive.
[90:36.50]I keep thinking how to make it rain.
[90:44.47]Beat his ass.
[90:45.17]One more of those and we're good.
[91:11.71]Oh, that's the kind of music you listen to.
[91:22.27]We're both almost dead.
[91:28.85]Alright, let's do it.
[91:32.68]This should be it.
[91:35.56]It's attacking me back now, so I'm having to dodge a little more.
[91:42.07]What's wrong with him?
[91:49.61]Oh, you're behind the star of this story.
[92:20.97]Let's fucking slide man This last roof must have been a nightmare architecturally, uh, we both aren't on the screen anymore on the same spot
[92:47.39]Oh shit.
[92:57.86]No, I suck.
[92:59.36]Don't worry, I'll res you.
[93:05.09]Thanks bro.
[93:13.31]You know, I think instead of the... If there was just a guy that kind of talked over this and was like, Oh, what a dastardly horrible thing these two girls found themselves in.
[93:24.40]They seem to be jumping over.
[93:25.88]They're getting over the ledge.
[93:27.54]I actually would kind of prefer that.
[93:30.76]You mean like... Like a narrator that kind of just says what we're in the middle of doing.
[93:36.35]Like Bastion.
[93:41.76]Bastion?
[93:42.98]Oh, the game, not the Overwatch character.
[93:45.10]Yeah.
[93:48.38]But maybe not as often.
[93:49.32]Because somebody right now is like, oh, that was so intense.
[93:53.60]Let's hope that our favorite ladies here find their way through the next horrible thing.
[93:58.76]Mr. Hammer was so scary, wasn't he?
[94:05.65]Oh, I'm looking at your screen.
[94:07.31]Sorry.
[94:08.27]I was in autopilot mode.
[94:18.06]Back to my world.
[94:19.06]Bald?
[94:19.52]Oops.
[94:22.00]The Baldur's Gate narrator?
[94:25.30]Yeah.
[94:25.58]What the fuck?
[94:26.48]We're just pigs.
[94:26.99]Just pigs?
[94:29.77]Just pigs?
[94:30.11]Actually, we're super pigs.
[94:48.14]This is the story you would write up.
[94:52.82]I think I'm going to have a panic attack.
[94:54.33]Hold RT for fart.
[94:55.59]You'll warm up to your super pig powers in no time.
[95:00.69]What?
[95:01.55]I got the fart pig.
[95:02.97]I have the retron.
[95:03.99]I don't want to do the narrator thing again, but.
[95:14.41]It would be... It would just be the narrator would just... Wouldn't he... Maybe the narrator wouldn't... Because saying like, oh, we farted, right?
[95:21.25]Oh, we farted, yeah.
[95:24.23]Because they've said, oh, magical farts.
[95:26.47]But if the narrator was just like, oh, something short has stinking here now.
[95:30.10]I think... Wouldn't that be fun?
[95:34.10]Yeah, I mean, that would probably be fun too.
[95:38.62]I just think if the...
[95:41.10]If the creator's intent is to create a you fart to fly as a pig segment, then I don't really care how good or bad the dialogue is, you know?
[95:51.18]It's just there to get me to the next fart pig segment.
[95:57.39]I'm just rolling around in the mud.
[95:58.81]Where are you?
[96:13.55]I'm making bubbles.
[96:14.17]Alright, so I guess I have to scratch.
[96:17.85]Head down, ass up.
[96:21.55]Oh.
[96:26.98]What if we just like wallowed in the mud for the rest of the stream?
[96:31.70]Um.
[96:31.90]I think it would be alright.
[96:36.71]Can you like push me up?
[96:43.28]Yeah, but can I launch you?
[96:44.50]I'm on the other side.
[96:46.68]Oh, how'd you do that?
[96:52.19]I flew with my fart powers.
[96:55.17]Do I need to jump?
[96:55.83]I need to like extend my head up and... Wait, I can hold that for a while.
[96:59.13]Let me see.
[97:10.22]Oh, I guess I can just walk over it.
[97:11.38]Okay.
[97:11.62]Okay.
[97:14.73]I've got the pink apple.
[97:15.75]You need to get the green apple.
[97:18.39]Can you find it?
[97:21.71]I hope so.
[97:24.15]Getting colder.
[97:24.89]Colder?
[97:27.29]Warmer.
[97:28.99]Oh, I found it!
[97:29.93]Oh, you found a secret.
[97:30.95]That's not even it.
[97:31.79]That's a different secret.
[97:33.31]Uh, there might be a problem.
[97:42.72]Okay, I made it.
[97:49.81]Oh, I found an apple.
[97:53.15]No, I don't think it's the right stream for that.
[97:57.69]No, no, I don't think so.
[97:58.93]You know, when you just kind of have to get the vibe, if you should do like a pig voice and snorts and stuff, it's definitely not right now.
[98:06.30]Even though there are two pigs on the screen, it's not even, it's not time for that.
[98:10.58]It just isn't.
[98:12.72]If there was ever a time to just like snort directly in the microphone, it's probably now.
[98:16.88]Have fun, get muddy.
[98:20.74]Why are you talking to your angel?
[98:22.94]Like shoulder angel and devil?
[98:29.10]Yes, do the pig sounds.
[98:31.02]Yeah, people think it's funny.
[98:33.50]No, don't do the pig sounds.
[98:34.56]It's going to be cringe and people already don't want to hear that.
[98:38.40]No, no, do it, do it.
[98:39.54]Maybe you'll get clipped.
[98:40.58]Maybe you'll get extra views.
[98:41.68]Oh.
[98:48.89]There's a green apple over here.
[98:51.56]And also a big ass pig.
[99:01.94]There's a pig warning sign.
[99:05.72]I'm just doing that.
[99:08.25]Yeah, pig crossing, look out.
[99:09.47]I guess we do have a sprint.
[99:29.24]Yours is over here.
[99:29.98]Okay, yours is on the red silo.
[99:37.63]Okay, yours is up.
[99:38.55]I think you have to fly over there.
[99:39.60]Uh...
[99:54.07]Hey, you got to climb on the pig.
[99:55.13]How come I can't?
[99:57.37]You have to go, uh, around.
[100:01.31]Now pig, doing pig noises for a funny joke is something you can never come back from.
[100:15.39]And it's one of those things that is just, you can't ever, uh, rewind that.
[100:21.59]So no.
[100:25.12]Do I have to do something to help you get over there?
[100:27.08]I don't know.
[100:27.60]Maybe I have to bubble?
[100:29.76]Jump on the bubbles?
[100:37.29]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[100:53.44]If you were a pig, would you want to be like someone's pet pig?
[100:57.37]Or just like... Food?
[101:00.27]No.
[101:00.83]No, just out in the wild.
[101:02.63]Just out in the wild as a wild hog.
[101:05.41]Oh, you want to be like a feral hog?
[101:07.96]I mean, I... Like with horns and tusks?
[101:11.16]I think so, or like a boar or something.
[101:13.08]I...
[101:18.20]so you're part of the like population that we need to like start handling it's getting out of control oh fuck yeah like is there any like pig that isn't like wicked fucked up or like treated like shit like you know what I mean like what the fuck's going on here
[101:45.73]I don't know, man.
[101:46.09]Just being like a little smart pig who can just eat anything you want sounds pretty good.
[101:52.79]Boars attack humans.
[101:54.35]Oh, yeah.
[101:54.75]I mean, yeah.
[101:57.80]Aren't boars wild hogs and wild... Aren't they... They're vicious.
[102:02.18]Aren't they like crazy?
[102:07.16]Wait, are you... Do you have to do this because you can get tall?
[102:15.14]Nice.
[102:16.90]Yeah, they're like monsters.
[102:22.28]Now what?
[102:22.89]I see, I see.
[102:23.57]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[102:24.31]Do it again, do it again.
[102:34.55]Rainbow power!
[102:36.11]There we go.
[102:38.05]Hey, nice.
[102:39.54]Some people are saying that in the human boar war, I would join the side of the pigs.
[102:48.70]I hope that the, uh, the rest of the game is this.
[102:53.16]Oh, cannibalism.
[102:54.90]What the hell?
[102:55.62]Oh my god!
[102:56.68]That's actually kind of fucking twisted.
[102:59.20]He's still alive!
[103:01.32]The little one's having a marshmallow.
[103:06.53]This is twisted!
[103:09.49]I think he's just getting a tan.
[103:16.31]Don't get it twisted.
[103:20.27]I think... Where's mine?
[103:21.09]Probably over here.
[103:29.42]Um... Maybe?
[103:31.70]Oh.
[103:40.62]Now I can get up there.
[103:44.11]And...
[103:46.53]Then I can... Oh, there we go.
[103:48.50]Excellent.
[103:50.32]Um... What?
[103:50.54]I like this area.
[104:16.63]Very colorful.
[104:17.71]Mm, very little pig.
[104:23.19]Does it count as a house made of bricks if you're using, like... wood beams as support pillars?
[104:32.86]I think we have to aggro the wolf and just bring him over here and have him blow the house down.
[104:41.61]Who's dropping shit from the sky?
[104:46.47]Oh, they're slaying pigs.
[104:48.41]They poop on you and stuff?
[104:50.56]Yeah, they... Why are they goldfishes?
[104:59.14]What about up there?
[105:11.37]What the heck?
[105:18.93]Is there something up there, or did you just take the fun route to get to this place?
[105:23.73]I just wanted to see.
[105:24.33]I mean, I like this area, like the broccoli and the cucumbers and the squashes.
[105:28.86]I like this spot.
[105:30.14]They eat your vegetables, kids.
[105:31.62]It's true.
[105:40.93]French fries are not a potato vegetable.
[105:51.12]Alright, we have to blow this house down.
[106:07.08]What about up here?
[106:07.64]There's a tomato thing we can climb up?
[106:15.31]How do we blow the house down?
[106:22.80]Dude, Joseph Farris's daughters figured this segment out in less than five minutes.
[106:28.04]I don't know who that is.
[106:32.00]That's the fuck the Oscars guy that made this game.
[106:36.71]Oh, wow.
[106:37.79]Show us how much I know.
[106:49.22]Oh, wait.
[106:49.68]Is this stuff down here?
[106:57.31]you're already down here yes uh where are you is the the haystacks that are floating around rolling around here okay I don't think that's where we're supposed to go but maybe I mean it's I'm I'm moving up here hold on this looks this looks promising
[107:40.52]This kind of looks like, uh... where we're supposed to go, actually.
[107:46.83]Where the hell are you?
[107:48.05]Um, I don't know.
[107:52.29]I don't know what I did.
[107:56.40]Holy shit!
[107:57.66]I just fucking did it!
[108:01.48]Look at this!
[108:01.88]Hey.
[108:05.63]I made it.
[108:05.99]Good save.
[108:07.87]Clean save.
[108:08.83]Alright, so we get in the hot air balloon and go.
[108:28.36]Oh, time to slide.
[108:32.34]Every level has to have a slide second.
[108:34.30]Go slide.
[108:35.02]Let's go.
[108:35.30]Let's go.
[108:35.54]Oh my God.
[108:40.44]I hope you weren't emotionally attached to those pigs.
[108:59.46]What?
[109:00.50]What the hell, Zoe?
[109:01.60]Because now we're fucking hot dogs.
[109:04.36]I know, I know, I know.
[109:05.92]Let's just end this.
[109:08.98]I told you I'd want to become food.
[109:10.36]That's what I said, and here we are.
[109:11.62]Hold on.
[109:14.79]You can't listen.
[109:15.51]I think you have to grill each other.
[109:16.87]Let's grill ourselves.
[109:25.11]Oh, hot.
[109:25.89]Oh, kind of nice, but... Ouch!
[109:26.95]Ouch!
[109:29.07]Alright, you gotta consistently move a hot dog.
[109:31.49]Don't just leave it, right?
[109:32.37]Alright, Etalyx, do you move the hot dog?
[109:36.70]I burnt myself.
[109:40.08]I'm grilled to perfection.
[109:43.10]What are you gonna ask me?
[109:45.00]They got cookies.
[109:45.74]Do you constantly move the hot dog on the grill or do you let it sit on one side?
[109:52.40]If it's only hot dogs, then you gotta move the hot dogs.
[109:54.80]Exactly.
[109:56.89]But if it's like hot dogs and other stuff, then they just sit there because you got it.
[110:00.03]You got to tend to the burgers first.
[110:02.81]Alright, do you are you a catcher?
[110:04.23]I'm more.
[110:05.29]This is very important.
[110:06.39]What?
[110:06.71]Why do I look like a log of shit and you look good?
[110:08.41]Because I'm perfectly you're probably like a like a brat or something.
[110:15.19]You kind of look like like I look like a regular Oscar Mayer wiener.
[110:19.55]You look like.
[110:21.73]You look like a sausage.
[110:25.65]Alright, you ready?
[110:26.23]It's time to be, like, are you a, um, are you a ketchup or a mustard?
[110:31.96]And I want you to come up here.
[110:32.64]Because I, uh, we need... I'm a ketchup.
[110:34.90]I'm, I'm, I'm waiting right here for the ketchup.
[110:37.32]Oh, okay.
[110:37.54]Well, I'm mustard.
[110:38.08]I wanted us to both choose and see, like, how, which one of us was which.
[110:41.84]Well, definitely.
[110:42.55]But, but, I do like ketchup and mustard.
[110:45.21]That's okay, too.
[110:46.61]But never mustard by itself.
[110:48.45]Oh, I'm a mustard by itself kind of guy.
[110:51.87]Too much!
[110:52.31]Stop!
[110:54.26]How do you go down there?
[110:55.58]Do you like ketchup or do you want both or just one?
[110:59.32]Just the ketchup.
[111:00.40]That way we can tell each other apart.
[111:06.30]I'd go a little heavier on the ketchup, though.
[111:10.02]I like just the one line.
[111:15.27]I need to be drenched in ketchup.
[111:17.83]It's true.
[111:22.48]Okay, now if a person, if like a big guy sat up on here and just picked us both up and started eating us.
[111:33.42]I honestly thought that was the win condition.
[111:36.20]So, what do we do?
[111:41.61]Why are there like, um... Is that jam?
[111:44.75]Like, what's... No, we're not going for a second coating though, right?
[111:48.57]No.
[111:48.63]Maybe it is that.
[111:51.13]Oh, these are undercooked.
[111:53.80]Oh, hold on.
[111:54.26]Can I fling you?
[111:56.12]Yep.
[111:56.22]Alright.
[111:57.08]Ready?
[112:00.44]Yeah!
[112:01.85]Okay.
[112:03.29]Oh.
[112:04.67]I'm dead.
[112:06.71]I'm back.
[112:09.07]So... What's the... What do we do?
[112:13.82]We might not be... Maybe we both need both condiments.
[112:20.42]In order to be, like, complete.
[112:22.78]Oh...
[112:29.85]now I would give myself oh that's we can't wait we can't choose what condiments we want you get both or you get none hey actually it's gonna happen
[112:48.03]why is all the weird that we say is like would be weird if it happened it happens after we say it that's weird because when they were at the like writer's room table no one ever said no like I said I wrote it when I was a kid what sort of devil child were you I guess there's no easy way to tell a kid how sausages are made that was traumatic but then imagine how a seven-year-old zoe took it let's move on I don't want to talk about it anymore I agree
[113:18.67]Okay, we're back here.
[113:20.27]Take me back to being a hot dog.
[113:21.37]Yeah, I hope there's way more of that because I found that to be like the most, that was like the funnest thing so far.
[113:26.97]Nope, you have a, you have to have a company mandated combat segment.
[113:53.13]I could smash it.
[114:01.81]Oh, don't touch that.
[114:03.19]Can you come back over here?
[114:08.42]Oh, you're all the way back there?
[114:11.04]The little lever that you can grab?
[114:12.70]I can grab this.
[114:14.40]Are you going to break something?
[114:18.18]Oh, shit.
[114:18.66]I have to make a little thing for you.
[114:19.96]Okay.
[114:21.32]Yeah, you have to make like a platform for me to jump on.
[114:24.64]Oh, that's sick.
[114:29.46]That good?
[114:31.87]I'm through.
[114:32.31]That was a super Wilhelm scream, yeah.
[114:43.67]Okay, I have to launch you.
[114:45.01]Thank you.
[114:51.76]Okay, that kills.
[114:56.26]I'm going to do the thing for you again.
[114:57.66]Can I have one a little closer?
[115:01.01]Thank you.
[115:01.41]Okay, now on the next platform, please.
[115:06.43]He's trying to hit me?
[115:07.49]I'm dead.
[115:11.41]They only last for like a set of minutes.
[115:13.93]Okay, they don't last long.
[115:14.93]Alright.
[115:22.64]Is that good?
[115:24.70]I'm free.
[115:33.56]I have no idea what those do, but I think they help you.
[115:36.16]I believe that they do help a lot.
[115:37.64]It is a very different experience for each player, but that's that's cool.
[115:50.99]You hear that?
[115:51.59]Built-in replayability.
[115:54.99]One playthrough, you get to be the pig that flies with Arden, and the other one, you get to be the pig that stretches really tall.
[116:01.98]Somebody said put very different in quotes.
[116:07.12]Well, it's kind of different.
[116:09.24]Okay, there you go.
[116:14.75]I missed the car.
[116:24.16]nice listen it's it's more different than your seventh playthrough of skyrim stop shooting at me cry me like a black mamba I love somebody said wrong
[116:49.47]You know, I actually never have played Skyrim actually ever.
[116:53.48]Just like the base game?
[116:54.48]No.
[116:55.26]I modded the hell out of it and just could never play the real game ever again.
[117:02.12]I never finished it.
[117:05.86]I spent most of my time comparing like texture mod graphics.
[117:11.27]And then when I finally got it to look exactly the way I wanted, I was ready to play a different game.
[117:18.27]Okay.
[117:19.25]That's a lot bigger than I remember writing it.
[117:21.42]You have unpaid parking tickets.
[117:23.68]Time to die.
[117:25.10]Excuse me?
[117:26.46]Run!
[117:26.66]Five-form plan.
[117:29.94]Your forces will be subject to towing.
[117:34.71]So now we owe this boss lady parking tickets as well?
[117:38.43]Yeah, she squeezes everyone... What did the villain say?
[117:42.94]That where if you go up against each other, we had to park illegally or something.
[117:47.90]And now we're dead.
[117:48.94]What do we do?
[117:50.85]I'm serious.
[118:13.55]Oh, you can really tell who played Mirror's Edge and who didn't care.
[118:16.10]That's fair.
[118:17.58]Turn back!
[118:18.08]Turn back!
[118:44.58]Okay.
[118:45.42]What?
[119:06.68]That's honestly enough versus them I could get behind, you know people want to rally politically against like administrators.
[119:13.37]I'll be down with that I'm ready for that revolution What do we do sphere you'll pay your parking ticket
[119:36.89]That was just stupid, and I'm embarrassed, and I'm ashamed of it.
[119:40.37]Wait, do I have to do this?
[119:43.21]My bad.
[119:43.69]I don't know what you did, but you're doing something.
[119:49.68]I'm playing Mario Galaxy.
[119:57.12]My blade will end you.
[119:59.12]Boom.
[119:59.90]Vroom vroom.
[120:07.13]Can you do anything or is it just me?
[120:09.11]I think I'm throwing stuff at him.
[120:10.51]Oh yeah, you have to throw stuff at him and that opens like a chamber for me to blow something else up.
[120:18.18]Shit.
[120:20.06]It's a Bowser fight now.
[120:23.08]If you don't like wheelies, please remove yourself from-
[120:36.28]How we doing down there?
[120:37.05]We're doing okay.
[120:37.93]What the hell?
[120:38.67]I fucking suck at Fall Guys, see?
[121:13.85]Have you ever won a Victory Royale in Fall Guys?
[121:17.04]No, never.
[121:21.14]I've gotten to the last two or three before, but I just can't ever, I've never been able to make that last jump to the crown.
[121:26.26]Somebody's always in front of me.
[121:28.41]When did you start playing at launch or like after the launch?
[121:31.51]It was way after launch, for sure.
[121:33.69]Okay, so, like, I went back to Fall Guys.
[121:35.79]Like, I played it at launch.
[121:36.67]I was like, oh, they've got to have so many more maps now.
[121:39.79]It's got to be, like, a completely different game.
[121:41.65]I went back and played it, and it was the exact same maps that I played at launch.
[121:46.30]And I won the first game back.
[121:49.48]And I was feeling really good about myself.
[121:52.12]And my girlfriend Alice was, like, super impressed.
[121:54.40]It was like, what a gamer.
[121:55.84]What a freaking game.
[121:56.64]And then I found out that they're all bot matches at the beginning now.
[122:02.68]That's like, uh... What is it?
[122:05.84]Marvel Rivals, right?
[122:06.88]It's like, oh my god, I just got like 40 kills in one game.
[122:09.38]And it's like, oh, you're playing against bots.
[122:10.88]Like, oh, what?
[122:11.56]No, I'm not.
[122:13.32]Very good.
[122:23.83]I got nothing else to throw.
[122:26.13]You're inside of me.
[122:27.41]I'm inside.
[122:33.40]What?
[122:33.66]What do I have to do?
[122:35.40]I'm dead!
[122:36.04]I died!
[122:36.32]I got it, I got it!
[122:37.36]Oh my god, I'm dead.
[122:58.03]Alright, we got we got to coordinate this because I'm dead when you're not and you're down in the other way I got it.
[123:04.64]I got it.
[123:04.98]I got it Hold on this is so much shit on the screen Alright
[123:23.43]Do I have to rip the core off?
[123:25.65]Oh, you got it.
[123:26.11]Nice.
[123:28.33]Nice, dude.
[123:29.18]Nice.
[123:30.48]Oh, this is like Dark Souls.
[123:36.40]He's the second phase.
[123:41.64]I mean, I guess I can grab him.
[123:42.90]I guess I can whip him.
[123:50.88]I'm like ripping pieces off.
[123:51.90]Jump rope.
[123:52.50]Jump rope.
[123:53.82]You got got by the jump rope segment.
[123:57.56]Listen, we gotta beat this in three minutes or ads are gonna start.
[124:00.28]Oh, where'd you go?
[124:01.80]I got him.
[124:03.03]I'm dead.
[124:07.27]Oh, I'm holding him.
[124:07.91]There you go.
[124:15.51]That was such a shitty way to go.
[124:17.15]Payments declined.
[124:20.19]You know, for Cyber Ninjas, on a stealth mission, we sure cause a lot of explosions.
[124:26.74]And it's gonna get worse.
[124:28.30]Why am I not surprised?
[124:29.90]Next up, those guys.
[124:34.24]How lovely.
[124:35.16]Don't worry.
[124:36.87]I got a getaway car.
[124:40.09]Are we getting -2 or is the game getting -2?
[124:42.02]I can't tell.
[124:42.48]I don't know.
[124:43.48]It's kind of synonymous at this point.
[124:45.04]You take the wheel.
[124:46.12]I'll ride shotgun.
[124:47.24]Flying is not going to lower my stress levels.
[124:50.23]Just drive.
[124:54.81]Keep her steady.
[125:04.53]The truth is, if you put anybody in this situation, if it were real, none of you would have anything funnier to say.
[125:10.45]I disagree.
[125:16.21]Okay.
[125:17.73]For a second, I didn't know who was driving.
[125:20.47]Let's take a break anyways.
[125:27.72]I was looking at the wrong screen.
[125:33.70]I'm surprised that a whole hour has gone by.
[125:36.30]That must mean we're enjoying it.
[125:39.16]No, yeah, like the game is good.
[125:41.18]It's just... Marvel dialogue bad.
[125:46.87]Yeah.
[125:47.23]Yeah, the game's fun.
[125:52.77]Yeah, right into the wall.
[125:53.73]Yeah.
[125:55.93]Crashing accidentally.
[125:57.32]Alright, let's...
[125:59.89]Look, I like Marvel dialogue, okay?
[126:01.59]I'm going to go rewatch Avengers.
[126:02.47]You're a big Marvel guy.
[126:03.39]You're a big Marvel guy.
[126:04.21]I was until everybody, like when everyone else was.
[126:09.56]And then after Endgame, there's no such thing as a Marvel guy posts Endgame unless you just like comics.
[126:19.98]Well, you are a original Marvel guy, right?
[126:25.56]I mean, I'm not going to pretend to be a comic knower.
[126:31.18]I like comics.
[126:31.80]I think they're cool.
[126:37.90]But yeah, back in a few minutes.
[126:41.18]See you soon.
[126:42.35]Oh, Daredevil?
[126:43.31]Okay.
[126:43.55]Don't get me started on Daredevil.
[126:46.71]Alright, we'll be right back.
[126:53.93]See you guys in about four or five minutes, maybe less, four minutes.
[127:28.93]Thank you.
[128:38.95]Thank you.
[130:11.43]Thank you.
[130:51.26]Welcome back.
[130:56.44]How are you?
[131:04.26]I've been doing this thing where every time I get up, when you get up each hour, are you doing the raise your legs high and walk around the room for a minute?
[131:15.33]I just ate a Trader Joe's sugar waffles.
[131:19.09]250 calories is pretty good.
[131:21.32]damn that sounds good I don't think I've ever had many of the trader Joe's sweets some of them are good some of them are gimmicks oh but uh I I typically if I'm gonna stretch I do lunges or I do squats
[131:48.37]Yeah, I kind of bring my knees up and then I'll squat down on the ground a few times.
[131:53.17]I just go down to my knees.
[131:54.94]You bring the knees up to you.
[131:56.08]I go down to them.
[131:56.96]Someone's saying Trader Joe's dark chocolate peanut butter cups are amazing.
[132:01.82]Have you ever had them?
[132:04.50]I haven't had like dark chocolate peanut butter cups.
[132:06.34]They have like dark chocolate covered puff chips.
[132:11.09]It's like, you know, like Cheeto puffs, but without the Cheeto.
[132:13.97]Yeah.
[132:15.64]So it's just like a plain flavor, but with like dark chocolate.
[132:18.09]So it's just like a fluffy, crunchy texture.
[132:20.75]Hmm.
[132:22.17]Oh my God.
[132:22.95]I didn't realize we were both ready.
[132:26.01]I'm ready.
[132:27.71]That sounds good though.
[132:29.59]Again, I did the same.
[132:30.39]Okay.
[132:31.75]We actually should switch controllers.
[132:34.26]I'm going way too low.
[132:37.44]Yeah, because like the flight is inverted, right?
[132:39.98]Like it's up and down and down is up.
[132:43.30]I'm staying up here.
[132:54.41]I gotta reload.
[132:57.99]Your ice cream sandwiches are like crack.
[133:01.86]I'll clear him.
[133:03.62]I just drove into it.
[133:09.62]I'm probably not making this very easy for you and I apologize.
[133:15.37]You're good.
[133:18.71]Alright, I got her six.
[133:29.61]It is tight.
[133:31.29]What do I do?
[133:31.91]What do I do?
[133:38.92]Oh, nice driving.
[133:42.16]It's a Christmas miracle that I haven't crashed.
[133:44.50]I hope there was a checkpoint.
[133:52.73]Okay, we're good.
[133:53.43]Yeah, we're good.
[133:53.91]It's fine.
[134:01.94]It's like a rock.
[134:03.74]Okay, I got two out of three.
[134:06.16]I'm gonna close my eyes!
[134:08.34]Don't!
[134:08.88]Believe in yourself!
[134:15.50]Who's driving the car?
[134:17.16]Am I driving?
[134:18.02]Why would I be driving now?
[134:19.02]I have the gun.
[134:19.59]Okay, so did we switch seats?
[134:35.43]It's definitely still you.
[134:36.69]Is it me?
[134:38.30]No, I think it's me.
[134:40.00]No, it is still me.
[134:40.56]Yeah, it's still you.
[134:43.76]Was I supposed to go through that?
[134:50.35]Dude, I don't know what they want me to do.
[134:57.51]I was trying to jump to the other one, but I couldn't get out of the...
[135:03.98]Yeah, that's what I have to do.
[135:05.24]Alright.
[135:09.42]Listen, you ever play a modern Sonic?
[135:13.00]It is like that, yeah.
[135:14.66]I fucked it up.
[135:30.83]I was trying to catch it early.
[135:32.03]I'm so sorry.
[135:36.61]Trust me, if we had a choice, I would always take the driving segments.
[135:42.45]Do you ever, um, do you ever play Halo?
[135:46.45]Not really, no.
[135:47.07]I feel like everybody who plays Halo is like, okay.
[135:53.96]Everybody who plays Halo is either, you're either the dedicated Warthog guy or you're the dedicated, like, Gatling gun guy.
[136:00.66]True.
[136:03.52]And I don't think you're the dedicated Warthog guy.
[136:05.30]No.
[136:06.47]No, definitely not.
[136:07.32]Dot dot dot.
[136:31.04]with Halo was I played it with Joel and we did legendary mode and I've never played the game before and we died probably a hundred times at the first maybe ten minutes of the game and we quit.
[136:50.13]That's the legendary Halo experience.
[136:53.57]I don't know why we decided to do it like that.
[136:59.19]by so many people have you ever done halo and legendary have you ever beat it uh yeah me and like a friend did it when it was like new on the split screen co-op just like this but uh you know I was a better gamer back then so I don't think I could do it now
[137:31.58]Have you ever wondered where all of this violence stems from?
[137:36.03]Whenever you have time, feel free to help me out.
[137:39.93]But surely all this action and killing must... I don't think we want to go out through the roof.
[137:44.80]We want to go out through, like, the door.
[137:47.00]But the pressure would keep the door closed.
[137:48.94]I feel like I'm ready to do some serious... Yeah, I feel like we would be... Have you ever thought about what you would do if your car went over, like, a bridge rail and you ended up in one of those TV show situations where you have to, like, get out of the flooding vehicle?
[137:59.85]One, two...
[138:04.15]I think we're gonna have to swim here.
[138:13.41]Ooh, I like this area.
[138:19.61]This is really nice looking.
[138:20.61]I like it a lot.
[138:35.26]You're supposed to open the door and leave before it fully sinks because the pressure would keep the doors shut.
[138:39.78]Don't they make a device to kind of pop out a window and you're supposed to keep it in your glove box or something?
[138:45.95]Oh yeah, like the little spike on the end.
[138:48.77]Yeah.
[138:50.37]To like break it open if something gets stuck.
[139:03.95]This is every single in a magazine financial advisor ad.
[139:12.43]This is the final shot of an untested medication that's still in trial, but they're trying to get you to buy it on the commercial.
[139:26.14]It's relaxing.
[139:49.05]There's a slide.
[139:50.69]I gotta go down the water slide.
[139:51.61]Oh, wait.
[139:52.65]That's awesome.
[139:53.43]There's two.
[139:55.09]You could have your own over there, actually.
[139:56.47]Ooh, alright.
[139:57.76]Will you do yours?
[139:58.42]Full throttle!
[140:01.24]Full throttle.
[140:01.98]That's what I say when I go down water slides, too.
[140:05.50]This character is just like me.
[140:11.43]I say, hey, dude, who's working the water slide?
[140:14.11]I'm feeling a little bit daring today.
[140:15.99]How about you put me down the slide backward?
[140:19.49]We gotta go in the other one.
[140:28.42]I feel like this is the kind of outfit I would want to wear to a water park.
[140:35.52]Just a full... a full spandex suit.
[140:40.78]Dude, being an adult, like a fully grown adult, you start to think about stuff.
[140:45.69]I don't know, Italic, tell me if you're the same way.
[140:47.55]I want to hear an input from you.
[140:51.05]Like, the water park now, when I was younger, was, man, this is so awesome.
[140:54.89]I can't wait to go down all the slides.
[140:56.31]Oh, I'm going to go on the lazy river.
[140:57.57]I'm going to eat a bunch of hot dogs.
[140:59.74]Now I just think of how, like, gross the place is.
[141:03.66]Like, oh, how many people pissed in that?
[141:06.58]People probably shit in this.
[141:09.08]No, that's true.
[141:12.27]And I just think about the amount of shock that it would take to clean these pools.
[141:18.18]And then you think about it, it's like 40% chemicals.
[141:20.70]They have so many chemicals.
[141:21.88]Yeah, no, it's just all chemicals.
[141:25.84]I want a water park where when you go to the water park, you have to sign a thing that says, I promise I will not piss or shit in this pool or drop a taco in the water.
[141:34.45]You just want a water park where children are banned.
[141:37.19]No, that'd be fine.
[141:39.49]Children could be there.
[141:48.41]You know what, though?
[141:49.07]Going back to that, I do think a water park where children are banned would be better.
[141:53.83]I would actually go.
[141:58.13]Like, I don't want to be chilling in the wave pool and have to worry about, like, Timmy, who's too close to where the waves are getting formed at the front.
[142:09.00]Somebody said, that's 1984 shit.
[142:10.52]Why?
[142:12.22]Because I want somebody to sign an agreement that they're not going to shit in a pool?
[142:16.53]No, it's my right to be able to shit in a fucking public water park pool.
[142:21.09]No, I don't care what anybody says.
[142:23.08]I want to be able to piss the shit in that thing.
[142:29.96]Listen, take a seat, Grandpa.
[142:32.80]Oh, this is nice.
[142:34.68]Damn.
[142:36.80]How about this, huh?
[142:40.02]Doc, when does the sun come up?
[142:43.07]Never.
[142:44.71]Hell, if we both have the opportunity to hang the phone up, then who's gonna do it first?
[142:50.62]I'm gonna stay here for a while.
[142:56.44]Just think.
[143:12.05]What about the ocean?
[143:12.73]But the thing about the ocean, the ocean is huge.
[143:15.17]The ocean is hundreds of gazillions of gallons of water.
[143:18.99]It's not like the lazy river that has not been changed out in probably like fucking 30 years.
[143:25.42]Yeah, it's way older than that.
[143:30.54]Where do we go?
[143:31.90]This looks like we can climb this, but I guess not.
[143:36.08]Do we just... Oh, that's not right.
[143:44.34]ocean water is also disgusting think about think about the ocean though there's hundreds probably probably like hundreds of millions of other fish shitting in that that's true
[144:04.59]Yeah, but is it, okay, is it weird that, I don't think it's weird that the fish that eat, oh, I have a diet of krill, and I poop out little krills, versus, like, you had fucking Burger King and Wendy's yesterday, and you're, like, shitting fucking out Burger King.
[144:18.12]That's way different.
[144:21.58]Way, way different, I think.
[144:23.53]Yeah, but, like, the fish are shitting out the Burger King wrapper.
[144:29.73]Oh, fuck.
[144:34.80]Yeah, and there's little things in the ocean that will eat that.
[144:37.60]There's the lobsters and the things that eat the algae.
[144:41.48]There's a whole ecosystem.
[144:42.53]There's not... Never mind.
[144:46.11]Are you supposed to throw me while I'm inside one of these?
[144:51.15]I think so.
[144:51.73]What's in here?
[144:56.01]Where do I toss you?
[144:59.57]Into traffic.
[145:03.08]you were so close oh okay I'll get you to the other side now what does that do for you uh I can do this oh that can hit by a bus
[145:34.71]Here we go.
[145:49.60]Stopped.
[145:50.10]Alright, this one made me laugh.
[146:01.05]Funny character.
[146:05.66]this area is for employees apparently we missed a side mission we missed a side mission side mission where is it out here it's outside apparently too bad oh no
[146:36.56]Stop touching it.
[146:40.46]Oh, I was doing that.
[146:41.50]That's my bad.
[146:44.44]Oh, yeah.
[146:45.04]Where is it?
[146:45.42]One of those portals, right?
[146:50.24]You guys are supposed to backseat way sooner.
[147:02.87]Behind the toilets.
[147:04.41]Oh, so we really missed it big time then.
[147:06.72]Alright, see if I can send you back across.
[147:08.82]You actually might if I can just grab it immediately.
[147:10.31]I'll just spam.
[147:12.57]Alright, I'm good.
[147:16.15]Now, how do I get to you?
[147:16.99]Can I throw this toilet over there?
[147:18.27]Maybe if I die, I'll respawn next to you.
[147:23.24]Oh, maybe.
[147:27.50]Oh, man.
[147:29.86]But where's the portal?
[147:31.48]Yeah, behind the toilets.
[147:38.13]Oh, you can do the same thing.
[147:40.23]If you launch one, you can grab it.
[147:48.16]No.
[147:57.66]I don't see anything here.
[147:59.26]What about the ladder?
[148:00.95]That's like there is a ladder up there.
[148:07.23]So if you knock that thing, you can't just spam R1 to grab it.
[148:15.45]It's not even like a prompt, I don't think.
[148:17.03]Build a ramp.
[148:21.81]I don't know if we can.
[148:25.59]Can you like grab this?
[148:27.45]Ready?
[148:36.41]I guess not.
[148:38.09]Restart at the checkpoint.
[148:40.80]Yeah, is there like a restart checkpoint thing?
[148:44.72]It's going to checkpoint us in the building though, isn't it?
[148:46.60]It said three minutes ago.
[148:49.80]Oh wait, it is in the building.
[148:54.41]Yeah, apparently you need to get in the toilet and I throw you up there.
[148:59.01]That's too bad.
[149:01.81]My Easter eggs.
[149:03.37]Chapter select.
[149:08.88]Oh, okay.
[149:10.30]Was it big city life?
[149:11.24]It'd be big city life, yeah?
[149:18.65]Okay.
[149:23.01]Hey, perfect.
[149:24.05]I get to go down the slide again.
[149:27.61]We skip the cutscene?
[149:29.45]Yeah.
[149:30.19]Have you ever wondered where all of this violence came from?
[149:32.70]We can't skip the cutscene.
[149:34.78]Whenever you have time, feel free to help me out.
[149:39.07]Oh, that's the one corner that my other monitor is blocking perfectly, so I didn't see it.
[149:47.21]Alright, so now... Sorry, sorry, circle.
[149:50.62]That's why you didn't understand.
[150:03.26]What do we get for doing the side missions?
[150:04.50]There's just one nerve.
[150:10.12]Like on the PlayStation controller, is it X or cross?
[150:16.34]Uh, it's X. I believe like Sony calls it cross.
[150:25.00]Yeah, cross.
[150:25.96]That's some weird.
[150:26.88]That's some weird shit.
[150:28.12]Sorry.
[150:28.24]Alright, so where are those toilets?
[150:40.13]No, I wanted it so bad.
[150:41.21]Yeah, I couldn't grab that one.
[150:42.17]Oh man, it looks like a jungle up there.
[151:05.32]Let's see.
[151:05.70]Alright, so you get in the toilet.
[151:11.69]Perfect time for an ad break.
[151:13.12]Throw you over here.
[151:16.76]Thanks.
[151:17.72]Maybe a little bit higher.
[151:19.50]Maybe, yeah.
[151:23.81]It's kind of pink.
[151:24.79]Can we not, like, knock the ladder down and then we just jump over to it?
[151:29.33]I think you need to be thrown up there and then you can knock it down.
[151:32.99]Pick up one of these, like, explosive barrels.
[151:40.40]I think it is aimed a little too low.
[151:43.50]OK.
[151:46.74]This is mushrooms.
[152:01.28]OK.
[152:03.00]New world.
[152:04.40]Ancient civilization was here.
[152:16.24]Sorry, mobile users in bed right now.
[152:17.70]Is Fable 3 a bad game?
[152:22.20]I think I played it for the first two hours and I said I'm not playing this again.
[152:26.22]I think that was pretty typical.
[152:47.60]There was definitely like, you know, like Fable 1 and 2 was better crowd.
[152:55.22]It was okay.
[152:59.83]It was one of those games that at the time it was released was bad, but because nothing else has come out like it in like 20 years, it's good.
[153:05.97]He wants us to get in his hand.
[153:19.60]This is weird.
[153:26.57]This is your world!
[153:27.53]Doesn't that hurt?
[153:32.09]It's like a, yeah, like getting a mosquito sting right under the nail.
[153:38.69]I like that these huge, giant people exist, but they just climb for fun for their entire lives.
[153:48.18]Yeah, okay, do these people live in even bigger houses?
[153:52.44]He's gonna kick.
[153:54.35]I hope you don't like your eardrums anymore, because they would both be gone.
[153:59.11]They'd be completely blown out after that.
[154:01.07]Shockwave.
[154:22.16]What if these are just normal-sized people and we're just ant-sized?
[154:25.62]Also true.
[154:29.33]Um... Is he gonna... I thought he was just gonna boot us.
[154:36.57]He's just hanging out.
[154:40.79]Sliding segment.
[154:51.28]I think, like, it's funny that this is someone's story, but neither of these two writers want to claim it.
[155:02.75]They're like, did you write this?
[155:03.67]No, I didn't write this shit.
[155:06.19]It's gotta be somebody else's story.
[155:08.09]The machine's glitching.
[155:09.19]I don't remember this one.
[155:10.13]Yeah, I don't know.
[155:13.51]I wouldn't have wrote this one.
[155:21.68]apparently zoe says that she did write it oh did she did she hey it was probably some like writing prompt on reddit one time or something you know it doesn't really count uh
[155:57.19]That was pretty cool.
[156:08.04]This definitely is like a giant ride, though.
[156:10.56]Yeah, no, it's... Nice catch, dead.
[156:18.23]We screwed it up.
[156:18.63]One of us had to survive that.
[156:19.75]I was so busy looking at the guy that I wasn't even... I just got tunnel vision.
[156:23.31]That's for trees, idiot.
[156:49.83]Yeah, wouldn't this guy have just blasted out his hands?
[156:53.09]Shit.
[156:54.45]You ever hit a baseball at the end of the at the end of the bat?
[156:57.91]I think we have to grab.
[157:01.56]Whoa, whoa, what shoe size is that?
[157:17.57]They're all artisanally crafted and handmade.
[157:19.63]What killed you?
[157:21.40]You jumped into the water.
[157:23.06]Oh.
[157:23.92]So... I wanted to see.
[157:45.01]He was fishing for us.
[157:47.71]I feel like we've seen that clip of them doing that probably eight or nine times.
[158:06.50]It's because they're on the roller coaster.
[158:11.02]Roller coasters are more fun if you put your hands up and scream.
[158:13.36]It's true.
[158:14.76]nice now come on you just have to get into it that was a cool one I like that one that was an interesting ride oh I'm back flipped off alright please please make the lives of uh like construction workers harder oh I think something solid is forcing down my
[158:46.66]um excuse me we're getting someone now you're in this thing it's okay it goes in a circle here we go
[159:22.43]rp walk please okay if you keep if you keep going juddery like that we're gonna think you're using wasd okay so the first person to break rp walk loses this challenge okay you just stopped well I you can stop but you can't run okay um what's this just a receptionist ignore her
[159:50.20]With an analog it actually is hard to do this without freaking out and just pressing up.
[159:57.16]What about jumping?
[159:59.80]Only when we absolutely have to.
[160:29.50]You're going the other ways a little harder, isn't it?
[160:31.88]I can't, uh... Wait, why can't I move?
[160:36.09]No, I lost, but I couldn't move!
[160:38.69]You lost, it's that easy.
[160:40.99]I actually couldn't move, though.
[160:43.17]Oh, you motherfucker.
[161:11.13]yeah where do we go what am I supposed to do I don't know down below us why can I get on the wall here I don't know okay we're just playing somebody else is playing a sniper game and we're the enemies they have to eliminate I can't get off the wall right like
[161:42.14]This is, uh... You have to do something.
[161:45.64]Wait!
[161:45.83]I have to double jump.
[161:48.51]Uh, we're pausing the game?
[161:51.61]We are?
[161:52.50]Yeah, because you can do this.
[161:55.90]Yeah, you can't do this at walking speed.
[162:14.36]You still committed.
[162:14.98]I thought you were going to walk off the edge.
[162:21.29]I already did that joke once.
[162:28.56]Well done.
[162:35.16]You deserve it.
[162:43.09]That actually kind of looks weirdly that I would... I'm like a bug.
[162:47.81]You should see some monitor.
[162:50.99]When a bug is on your TV, yeah.
[162:59.84]Okay, this is weird because you're doing it differently than I'm doing it, so it's freaking me out.
[163:15.56]Oh, yeah, like our sense of perspective.
[163:21.76]I'm playing a top-down platformer right now.
[163:26.78]Yeah.
[163:27.16]I mean, I just described the game.
[163:28.78]Yeah, I'm sorry.
[163:29.34]That was not a unique take.
[163:31.68]Well, you're in an isometric game, and I'm in a... Are you upside down for you now?
[163:38.19]I am.
[163:40.27]I'm very upside down.
[163:44.72]That was a Hatsune Miku burger.
[163:49.18]Kinda was.
[163:56.64]This really makes you think about how everybody that you meet in life has a different perspective.
[164:07.08]No, it's only these two perspectives.
[164:10.73]Up and down.
[164:25.75]That'd be a great movie poster.
[164:36.31]Whoa, that's cool.
[164:37.87]Nice, you made it.
[164:47.25]no who's this ad for no one can see it from street level yeah no one would ever be up here like is the route that we took to get here the normal entrance that people use to get to this motorcycle store that that's like how you get in unless it's we came in the all the way through the back
[165:10.35]Flying cars, that's true.
[165:11.09]I hope I'm driving.
[165:11.65]Oh, me too.
[165:12.33]Trust me, me too.
[165:13.99]I'm not a mechanic.
[165:14.59]Dad is.
[165:37.97]Okay.
[165:39.51]Now we're getting somewhere.
[165:46.04]Hop on.
[165:48.26]Good to you.
[165:51.10]Wait, wait.
[165:51.52]Don't we need helmets?
[165:54.33]If we wore helmets, then how would we see who the characters are?
[165:59.49]You're squeezing too hard, Zoe.
[166:00.73]You've got to let me breathe.
[166:02.25]Sorry.
[166:03.43]Just don't crush.
[166:04.79]Get rid of incoming...
[166:06.75]It's so loud.
[166:09.03]It does just get so loud.
[166:10.81]Motion sickness is kicking in.
[166:12.25]Don't draw upon me!
[166:16.54]That'd be so funny if a bunch of pups just hit the, uh, hit the, like, R screen.
[166:22.48]Yeah.
[166:28.70]Okay, that is, that's one, I'm allowed one crash.
[166:30.77]You're supposed to be the driver.
[166:32.51]I'm allowed one crash.
[166:46.31]The first one's free.
[166:53.40]Like, I gotta put us on the different platforms.
[167:03.14]Look out, cyber ninjas.
[167:04.82]I hope this is the road rash segment.
[167:08.02]Just take that guy.
[167:19.67]Yeah, just keep him.
[167:24.38]I think I got this of course you do block up ahead I don't think that one's me I don't think that one's me maybe I can jump over it can I jump over it you won't get yeah you jump I think I got this of course you do right block up ahead
[167:48.41]Nice.
[167:51.02]Is that a fuckers?
[167:52.82]Did she say take that fuckers?
[167:56.16]What is this game rated?
[167:59.48]Is this teen?
[168:00.34]Okay.
[168:06.48]Don't jump on that part.
[168:08.99]There's the tower.
[168:10.05]That's where we're heading, Zoe.
[168:18.55]You're throwing, like, inflatable balloons at me.
[168:24.99]Yeah, I'm throwing tubes.
[168:33.32]Uh, okay.
[168:33.78]Look, listen, chat, for every crash I'm having, multiply that by four if we had the controls wrong.
[168:40.23]We don't know that.
[168:42.37]We don't know if that's true or not.
[168:43.75]What if I did it very good?
[168:48.59]That's not confirmed.
[168:49.33]You just have to left trigger, right trigger.
[169:00.84]I've got to time jumps.
[169:01.94]I got to get the pink.
[169:03.22]I'm pressing the button.
[169:04.36]There we go.
[169:05.68]I got to hit this jump.
[169:08.00]This is a fun ride.
[169:10.65]I get to be on the ride.
[169:14.47]It's great.
[169:19.95]It looks like I'm driving, so people will think I'm driving in the video.
[169:29.13]Get ready!
[169:37.39]What do you mean before it explodes?
[169:39.29]What?
[169:39.63]Scan my face?
[169:40.37]I have to do a captcha?
[169:42.35]Boxes.
[170:07.78]Is that all the boxes?
[170:09.80]Oh, my God.
[170:10.78]Trucks, firetrucks.
[170:16.84]There's not a giraffe in this whole picture.
[170:19.98]I confirm I'm over 18 of driver's license.
[170:25.23]Was that guy speaking English?
[170:28.21]What was that guy saying?
[170:38.18]I've read the, yes, I get it.
[170:39.71]I accepted the terms already.
[170:41.31]I did.
[170:41.43]I have to read the terms?
[170:42.53]I think it was scripted.
[171:09.57]That one was pretty funny.
[171:11.36]That was a good one.
[171:12.28]I would say that was like a quote good one.
[171:14.86]That was very funny.
[171:19.88]We are killing people.
[171:20.96]I thought this was like a T for teen game.
[171:23.85]They did the slide.
[171:24.69]Yep, it was there.
[171:26.31]You're right.
[171:28.69]Oh no, I have to drive too.
[171:30.65]Fuck.
[171:36.84]The guy calling.
[171:38.10]He was like screaming at her.
[172:39.94]You can tell when a part is hard and dope because no one's talking.
[172:43.34]Fuck, he just got me killed.
[172:46.20]Yeah, because like when you die, I look over to the other screen and it starts to make me die.
[172:54.69]Yeah.
[172:56.26]Because you want to see what's happening to like the other person.
[172:59.60]Yeah, you need to know.
[173:07.34]Oh shit, I have no, here we go.
[173:09.00]Yeah, I got no, I got no gun.
[173:10.92]What is happening to my character?
[173:13.92]I have to sit up.
[173:18.22]This is definitely a sit up moment.
[173:23.15]Alright, you know what?
[173:32.41]I can, I can wait.
[173:34.61]What was there?
[173:40.46]alright I made it you can drift once and for all do I build up boost when you control the money like we do you control it all
[174:05.92]A tank.
[174:06.98]Did you ever play like the Battle Royale mode in Mario Kart?
[174:10.00]Yes, absolutely.
[174:12.02]The balloons?
[174:13.04]Yeah, the balloons.
[174:14.08]That was awesome.
[174:35.51]I think it was like more fun than the regular races.
[174:37.47]Can you play that stuff online?
[174:44.46]Uh, I don't know if they, do they even have Battle Royale in like the new Mario parks now?
[174:52.20]I guess, yeah, I guess so.
[174:54.20]Dude, wow, that would be a sick tournament, don't you think?
[174:59.32]Yeah.
[175:01.97]Would a Mario Kart Battle Royale tournament be something that was worth watching?
[175:10.58]Probably.
[175:15.65]What if we look into that?
[175:19.55]Boy, we got to kill the ants.
[175:20.31]We got to kill the ants.
[175:48.74]The best part about that is it's not Mario Kart, so I would be able to participate and not be in last place.
[175:55.92]yeah honestly Mario Kart is one of those games that just looks easy and it's not it's not really like if you want to be good like you anybody can play it that's kind of the genius of it but if you want to win you have to know where every single shortcut that you need to save mushroom boost for you need to know that you can like ramp off of this to cut through a quarter of the map it's true oh no next form
[176:36.70]Oh, you have to jump.
[176:37.50]You have to... This is a raid boss.
[176:41.66]Yeah, the bosses have been getting progressively harder.
[176:45.69]And more elaborate, I will say.
[176:49.67]Hey, we need to focus the right foot.
[176:51.49]Right relative to me, of course, which is currently on my left.
[176:54.53]And now it's back on my right.
[176:56.39]Charging.
[176:58.74]Charging.
[177:07.59]One more leg.
[177:13.71]Alright.
[177:14.43]Alright, now we gotta get the head, probably.
[177:30.94]What we do?
[177:35.18]Oh, ram.
[177:37.46]Ramp and shoot.
[177:38.18]Oh, that's cool.
[177:39.38]I like that a lot.
[177:40.20]That's fun.
[177:41.08]Yeah, that's cool More
[178:11.61]Did she say ow?
[178:13.82]She said ow, dare you.
[178:15.94]Oh, that she said ow, dare you.
[178:29.30]Oops.
[178:33.96]Okay, I got a little too close.
[178:46.70]yeah you had to carry that one same deal let's go yeah please tell me that this story is over now yeah it is
[179:17.82]the glitch let's get it oh good job can I ask you that deserves a high five in game what's with all the debts and payments in this story what do you mean I'm just curious as to what the story's about I told you it's a revenge story that part I got trust me but what's it really about nothing
[179:42.94]Oh, come on.
[179:44.18]You always put a bit of yourself into what you create.
[179:47.24]I don't think that's true.
[179:49.24]Wait, so you're telling me everything we just went through wasn't inspired by anything?
[179:56.14]Nope.
[179:57.71]Nothing.
[179:59.17]Nothing.
[180:00.17]Nothing at all.
[180:00.81]All stories are inspired by things or experiences that we've been melded by.
[180:04.31]I don't believe you.
[180:06.69]I don't care.
[180:07.31]Well, I kind of do.
[180:10.13]Why?
[180:11.35]You don't know me.
[180:13.24]Maybe not.
[180:14.96]But seeing as we're trapped here together, it could be useful to know what to expect going forward.
[180:23.31]We meld the world around us.
[180:27.73]I'm glad somebody remembered that from that stream.
[180:30.97]I just want to go to the next mini game.
[180:43.24]Yep, those glitches are definitely doing something.
[180:46.84]It seems to be expanding.
[180:54.77]What is this?
[180:55.33]It's spreading.
[180:56.55]What is going on?
[180:57.95]It's those glitches, sir.
[180:59.21]Has he been just standing here for three hours?
[181:01.73]What if time moves differently for us?
[181:03.37]Oh, it might.
[181:04.87]Okay, that's it then.
[181:05.75]Let's just cut our losses and shut their extraction.
[181:08.23]Shut it down.
[181:08.95]Kill them.
[181:09.47]Yes, sir.
[181:10.21]Right away.
[181:13.63]It's not working.
[181:14.47]What do you mean it's not working?
[181:16.15]Just get them out.
[181:17.49]Sir, those glitches are blocking that command.
[181:20.70]Hey, who wrote the code for this?
[181:23.46]Bring the programmers in here.
[181:24.74]This thing, he probably did.
[181:27.86]We could possibly lose every extraction.
[181:30.22]God damn it!
[181:33.32]Is it possible to communicate with them?
[181:35.48]Yes.
[181:36.30]Yes, we could broadcast their signal up to us, sir.
[181:38.53]Set it up and bring me all the information you have on these two.
[181:41.31]This is chat, they're gonna be watching these guys stream.
[181:44.13]He seems really stressed about our glitch hunt.
[181:46.79]Good, let him sweat.
[181:53.35]So, what story do you think we'll go through now?
[181:56.36]Last one was mine, so probably one of yours.
[181:58.84]Yes, I have so many good ones.
[182:01.34]How can you be so excited by all this?
[182:03.84]What?
[182:04.76]We might as well enjoy it while we're here.
[182:19.34]Okay.
[182:19.64]I need more than two monitors.
[182:20.88]That's way too many.
[182:21.72]Yeah, but two is too few.
[182:22.74]I think like three is a sweet spot.
[182:25.46]Yeah, three is perfect.
[182:26.16]I think you can get by with two.
[182:27.06]Even one if it's a laptop or something.
[182:28.21]I'm well aware of that.
[182:42.11]Have you ever seen Maniac on Netflix?
[182:43.25]I don't believe so This is a lot like that In fact, I would be shocked if
[183:09.58]They didn't watch Maniac and were like, let's make a game.
[183:12.34]Oh.
[183:15.92]Oh God, we're animals again.
[183:17.18]Oh my God.
[183:19.74]Is this fur?
[183:23.32]Zoe?
[183:26.08]What have you done to me?
[183:28.42]Relax.
[183:29.50]I'm going to love this one.
[183:30.62]I already know it.
[183:31.72]Where are you?
[183:33.63]Do you see the golden light?
[183:37.71]Yes.
[183:38.77]Over here.
[183:48.66]Oh, wait, you get to be the monkey.
[183:50.02]I'm the fairy.
[183:51.30]Did you turn me into a monkey?
[183:54.13]You know, you can turn back into your human form like this.
[183:59.87]How did you do that?
[184:01.21]Just think of your human form and you'll transform.
[184:12.46]We're shapeshifters.
[184:14.68]Amazing, isn't it?
[184:16.88]I know how much you're already holding it against me that I get to be the monkey.
[184:21.07]I didn't want to say anything, but I am very upset about this.
[184:23.95]How do you turn?
[184:24.63]Oh no!
[184:25.05]Alright, change controllers.
[184:25.93]I mean, actually kind of cool though.
[184:26.93]I think I can chain jumps together.
[184:52.35]It's okay, I get to go... They got them in the booth and just said, do monkey noises.
[184:57.95]I guess I can jump an infinite amount of times.
[184:59.39]I'm dead.
[185:15.06]they listen they heard you recently played infinity Mickey so they made you the fairy character you're a tree so that's kind of cool you get to be a tree I'm a force of nature bro shapeshift to swim wait I'm just I'm just a little swimming guy
[185:41.65]Are you, uh, we're coming up on an hour here.
[185:44.89]You good to get up for a minute?
[185:47.31]Get up, stretch, turn into a monkey, whatever you need to do.
[185:50.43]I feel like it's a good place before each one of these chapters.
[185:54.39]I think so.
[185:54.79]Uh, everyone wants me to say the Groot line, but I don't think I can.
[186:02.44]I don't think I'm good enough at it.
[186:04.20]What, what is, what's the Groot line?
[186:05.68]Um, the one line that Groot says.
[186:12.81]That sounds like something a Marvel guy would know.
[186:14.77]I don't know what he says.
[186:15.81]We'll have to consult with a Marvel fan later.
[186:18.65]Alright, fine.
[186:21.93]I'll do it so everyone can stop saying it.
[186:27.32]I am good.
[186:35.76]He said it.
[186:39.95]I inhaled that whole time, so.
[186:42.59]I was curious.
[186:43.63]Alright.
[186:44.72]See you guys in a few minutes.

[190:06.96]Thanks for watching!
[191:09.94]welcome back let us begin the next chapter welcome back hey oh hey everybody oh how many how many booms does this game get right now uh I would give this
[191:34.97]couple of couple of booms I think it gets bonus booms because I don't know if you mentioned it on your chat the like friend system that's true so uh only one person has to buy this game and the other person if you play with someone else obviously you have to play with someone else can play for free
[191:58.05]Yeah, I think this game is very nice.
[192:01.03]I think it's a fun game just to chill and play it with a friend or whoever.
[192:07.04]And it's kind of just a big theme park ride.
[192:11.48]Yeah.
[192:14.55]Alright.
[192:14.79]So I need to do this and maybe does this do something for you?
[192:28.16]Maybe you just cleared this tunnel?
[192:29.54]Because I can lift this tree up, but then... Oh, I guess I... Okay, no, I'm... Oh, hello.
[192:43.80]Oh, I didn't see you there.
[192:48.16]I am Groot.
[192:51.58]I think the Godzilla universe got a little...
[192:57.34]lost the plot maybe okay wait we can't swim in this water oh the piranhas alright what can I turn oh wait I can do this not laughing now are you way cooler than being a gorilla I guess how do I get over there I think I have to do something oh be a human
[193:42.28]Am I missing something?
[193:43.22]Uh, let me make sure I don't have to do anything for you.
[193:50.92]I might have to.
[193:51.62]Um...
[194:04.86]There we go.
[194:05.24]I had to get good.
[194:07.51]Can you make it over here, though?
[194:10.85]What is the gorilla have for power?
[194:13.45]Can you go back to the... I can go back to this one.
[194:20.80]Can I grab you or something?
[194:25.38]I might have to actually hold on to me.
[194:34.37]I have to use fish pa- Oh, it's a different button.
[194:36.63]Whoa, you got a different thing.
[194:38.23]Yeah, but there's piranhas still.
[194:40.85]Oh, the piranha only eat humans.
[194:43.35]Okay, so that's what I was missing.
[194:54.65]I'm never gonna forgive you for this.
[194:56.23]Some fresh air will do you good, city girl.
[195:03.76]Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
[195:05.10]I knew that was coming and I still went anyway.
[195:07.52]I thought you were already through it.
[195:08.96]I thought you already got through the whole thing.
[195:16.95]Now you're through it.
[195:17.81]Oops.
[195:31.30]Not so bad being a shapeshifter now, huh?
[195:33.47]I feel violated.
[195:35.43]You know, I took inspiration for this story from when me and my sister were younger.
[195:40.29]We used to imagine we were different kinds of animals and... Can we just skip to the end?
[195:44.33]Oh, come on.
[195:46.19]I was just in your story and I didn't complain.
[195:48.35]Uh, you complained the whole time.
[195:54.31]The Ice King It's been a while since I've seen any Adventure Time
[196:19.61]In a very long time.
[196:32.59]OK, I don't mean this to be as like much of a jab as it's going to sound, but how much do you have to watch of Adventure Time before it gets good?
[196:41.20]Huh.
[196:46.10]I think adventure time is... We have to both do this, by the way, to get maximum speed.
[196:54.38]Back, forward.
[196:56.06]Back.
[196:57.34]Forward.
[196:58.66]Back.
[196:59.86]Forward.
[197:00.12]You're not swinging.
[197:00.88]I'm swinging.
[197:02.06]Forward.
[197:03.93]One.
[197:04.79]Uh-huh.
[197:06.41]Uh-huh.
[197:07.39]And then dump him.
[197:08.21]That was... I dumped myself.
[197:09.59]Hey, come on.
[197:20.44]Adventure Time is kind of... I don't know.
[197:25.36]I feel like I watch an episode and I go, huh.
[197:28.96]And then I watch like two more and I go, huh.
[197:31.88]Yeah.
[197:33.04]I think that's fair.
[197:34.24]And then I don't really watch it anymore.
[197:35.84]I kind of... Yeah.
[197:40.12]I would... I feel about the same.
[197:46.22]This is going to sound like you mentioned, you don't want to make this an insult or anything, but Adventure Time is a great, at least I haven't watched it in over 10 years, but it was a good background show when you're doing something else.
[197:59.53]It's just like, oh, that's on.
[198:00.87]And I look up every so often and go, huh?
[198:06.93]Dude, am I stupid?
[198:09.45]You should have got the monkey because I don't know.
[198:14.28]Can you swim under?
[198:16.89]Oh, see, you should have got the monkey.
[198:18.73]Dude, I'm so monkey and fish pilled.
[198:21.94]There's a light going up there.
[198:23.82]Like, of course I'm going to think that that's where I'm supposed to go.
[198:26.26]Yeah, this is like a Marvel character.
[198:29.10]And yeah, this is definitely more your speed here.
[198:31.98]I'm definitely fish and gorilla pilled.
[198:35.08]Yeah.
[198:35.26]Are you saying I'm a fairy?
[198:38.79]I'm saying that you are whatever you want to be.
[198:44.49]I could be a fairy.
[198:49.68]Go easy now.
[198:51.26]Or max it out.
[198:52.90]I think you have to jump when I land and I have to... And vice versa.
[198:56.28]I don't think I can jump with this character.
[198:58.60]Oh.
[199:02.31]Hold on.
[199:02.71]There we go.
[199:04.67]Wait, maybe I should be little.
[199:05.39]I have an idea.
[199:09.51]Turn into the tree in midair.
[199:12.25]Oh.
[199:12.41]Yeah, that's what I'm going to do.
[199:13.35]Ready?
[199:18.61]This is...
[199:20.96]There has to be a way to do this, right?
[199:25.06]Is there even a puzzle or is this just a funny thing you can do?
[199:29.58]I feel like you were right.
[199:30.72]Hold on.
[199:31.06]Do it again.
[199:32.08]Knock me up.
[199:36.13]No.
[199:36.81]Maybe if I switch.
[199:37.81]Hold on.
[199:41.03]Whoa!
[199:41.69]That did it.
[199:44.63]Wait, why did I not knock you up?
[199:47.31]I didn't go very high.
[199:49.96]Try one more time.
[199:57.35]I'm getting off this thing.
[199:58.57]Yeah, I think I think that was just like a neat thing.
[200:03.45]12345 12345678910.
[200:13.14]Who pretty?
[200:27.22]um looks like there's more than a few ways to go over there I was just looking for secrets okay now you actually have to yeah yeah you're gonna go uh gorilla powers
[201:01.16]Oh, can you not hurt it?
[201:02.06]We have to wait until it crosses on the left.
[201:05.02]Oh, okay.
[201:08.86]So wait until it comes back.
[201:11.08]And now go.
[201:14.89]Cool.
[201:24.79]So now what?
[201:27.93]Ah.
[201:30.31]I feel like we have to get in that and make it go up or something.
[201:34.69]We might have... I think we may climb it.
[201:37.43]Bear and climb this thing.
[201:41.04]That is so cool.
[201:43.56]See, it's funny that you implicitly know all the things that your character would know.
[201:47.70]And that I know all the things my sci-fi character would know.
[201:53.62]You didn't know about the fish?
[201:56.12]Yeah, it's because this is your fantasy world.
[201:59.54]You should have sensed it.
[202:16.61]I think I can... I can, yep.
[202:21.19]Why am I happy that you died?
[202:25.65]Why am I happy you died?
[202:28.09]You died and my character went...
[202:36.03]See, now I'm happy.
[202:54.71]Are you serious?
[202:59.05]He's just continue the sentence.
[203:05.51]For a second, I didn't realize we were actually side scrolling.
[203:08.38]I thought, okay, but I don't have to do this.
[203:10.68]Yeah.
[203:12.84]You have to lower the tree for me.
[203:18.66]And then you can raise it.
[203:20.72]Oops.
[203:21.12]Pretty please.
[203:29.53]And then I... Watch that.
[203:32.51]Oh, it's a daisy.
[203:35.64]Oh, it's turned toward you.
[203:38.62]Nope.
[203:38.80]Oh, I'm sorry.
[203:43.04]That one was on me.
[203:44.70]Okay, so then now you turn me.
[203:46.40]Go, go, go, go.
[203:47.76]Grab it.
[203:47.96]What are you doing?
[203:49.27]Why is my guy not grabbing it?
[203:50.37]Okay, I thought he was far enough past for that to... Because it's a race against the middle one.
[203:59.67]Okay, I'm just going to go on when you're ready to go.
[204:01.49]And I'll be ready.
[204:03.15]Hold on, let me turn this one toward you.
[204:06.41]Smart.
[204:15.60]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[204:17.66]It's there.
[204:22.08]You got the hang of it.
[204:25.38]When are they going to make another Rayman?
[204:29.92]Another Rayman would be awesome.
[204:32.32]I didn't play very many of them, but I played a couple of them.
[204:34.20]I played the... Where am I going?
[204:37.22]Oh, you have to get both.
[204:37.96]I think you have to do both.
[204:40.56]Uh-oh.
[204:42.16]Okay, hold on.
[204:42.98]Let me get the first one first.
[204:48.19]Then the second one.
[204:52.95]Very nice.
[204:54.85]Oh, that was... Alright.
[204:56.75]Oh, I'm dead.
[205:01.54]Okay.
[205:08.88]It's not enough.
[205:10.28]It's not enough.
[205:11.78]Why is it not enough?
[205:13.80]Am I doing something wrong?
[205:14.68]I think I'm doing something wrong.
[205:17.22]Am I not going?
[205:17.86]Am I... You have to... Oh, I need to go back and hit the first one again.
[205:24.68]Oh, shit.
[205:26.91]Okay, hold on.
[205:28.11]Okay, that one was on me.
[205:30.92]Alright, last try.
[205:31.42]Rabbids took over Rayman?
[205:34.12]When you go from right and then right to left, you see the second flower up?
[205:38.08]You need to follow that without hitting the, like, spikes.
[205:41.43]Okay.
[205:57.63]That's fine.
[206:01.58]Oh, this one kind of sucks.
[206:02.56]You gotta go all the way to the right.
[206:03.94]Alright, here we go.
[206:09.94]Oh, I have to like lower it for you.
[206:11.44]You gotta wait.
[206:15.75]Oh, come on.
[206:21.65]This one's tricky.
[206:22.37]Alright, this one is tricky.
[206:26.97]Ready?
[206:30.15]One.
[206:34.28]Two.
[206:34.60]Hold.
[206:38.18]Three.
[206:40.70]Create the gap.
[206:42.84]You did it.
[206:46.07]Okay.
[206:49.25]Good.
[206:49.89]Thank you.
[206:50.27]Nice jump.
[206:54.83]That was brutal.
[206:58.85]I think I can go that way.
[207:05.62]Oh my goodness.
[207:12.08]This is kind of.
[207:16.37]Kind of doing subway surfers over here.
[207:25.35]Oh yeah, we're having very different.
[207:33.43]Yeah, it seemed this is very different, I'd say.
[207:41.76]we both made it at the same time oh yeah we meet up here alright so now what uh I have to go get this and then oh get you to jump on it and then you pull me to the I think you have to pull my oh my god you know what they warned me I saw the bird get killed by it so that's on me
[208:15.20]Somebody needs to study why whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa has made it into so many games.
[208:18.92]I thought you were telling me to slow down.
[208:21.84]Okay.
[208:23.62]Go down.
[208:23.94]Slow and steady now, please.
[208:26.64]Right.
[208:26.88]Yeah, you're talking about the whoa, whoa, whoa.
[208:29.33]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[208:36.61]I think it's supposed to sound realistic.
[208:39.79]That's what somebody would do in that scenario.
[208:41.65]What would somebody do if they were wobbling around really in real life?
[208:46.31]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[208:54.17]Much realism.
[208:58.62]Do I have to carry you across?
[209:01.32]Or do I have to go to the other side?
[209:02.62]Yeah, we have like a timer.
[209:04.76]Alright, bring it over here.
[209:06.90]Actually, no, no, no.
[209:07.42]I think you're good right there.
[209:08.37]There we go.
[209:13.35]Don't let them get me.
[209:14.17]I tried.
[209:19.43]I think I made it.
[209:30.45]Speedrunning strats.
[209:32.57]I think I crossed the respawn threshold here.
[209:40.36]Thank you.
[209:41.72]Excuse me.
[209:42.36]Thank you.
[209:43.34]Oh my God.
[209:45.38]Thank you.
[209:48.98]What's that from?
[209:50.56]Thank you.
[209:51.20]What?
[209:51.56]Someone saying thank you?
[209:53.08]No, that specifically.
[209:54.92]Thank you.
[209:57.12]Metal slug.
[209:59.56]Oh, metal slug.
[210:03.51]Maybe a gorilla?
[210:10.71]Has my tail always been glowing?
[210:14.27]Maybe?
[210:21.22]Is this bait?
[210:21.88]Are we not supposed to be over here?
[210:23.66]There's a whole rest of the level.
[210:25.80]Oh, maybe this is just a safe point.
[210:27.50]Yeah, this is just... Oh, shit.
[210:32.92]Why did you grab it?
[210:34.74]I was trying to transform into a fish.
[210:44.03]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[210:47.81]Whoa.
[210:49.71]I don't know.
[210:50.05]It's just like...
[210:52.33]I guess people this just sounds normal, but.
[210:56.79]It's also kind of just something you say when you're nervous.
[211:00.73]Oh, I think you're on a timer.
[211:04.17]They are swarming.
[211:06.41]Yeah, quick quick Jack Sparrow moment for you, let me.
[211:17.41]I'll be right back with your ride.
[211:21.86]Super Mario.
[211:22.46]Alright, I'm ready.
[211:32.16]Okay, so I have to swim around on the left.
[211:36.67]And then I jump on that, and then you have to swim quickly, because I will die by the piranhas.
[211:49.83]What do I do?
[211:51.64]I don't know.
[211:53.12]Wait.
[211:53.46]Oh, I just, do I have to just drag the whole thing through?
[211:56.56]Okay.
[211:57.84]Jesus.
[211:59.78]I have to draw.
[212:00.30]I thought there was a, I thought I could grab the one that you're on.
[212:02.76]I thought you could just get the one I was on.
[212:05.80]This area looks delicious.
[212:08.18]It does.
[212:09.94]Looks really inflating the, uh, the death count here for you to make it look like I'm better.
[212:16.30]Could you?
[212:23.04]Heavy machine gun.
[212:25.28]Heavy machine gun.
[212:27.26]Thank you.
[212:31.98]I'm dying here.
[212:32.84]I'm dying here.
[212:33.66]This is as fast as you gotta go.
[212:34.78]Alright.
[212:38.28]We're gonna lower.
[212:39.74]Down.
[212:39.96]Very good.
[212:45.67]Up.
[212:46.77]Ahoy, Captain.
[212:47.95]Another side story up ahead.
[212:49.93]I just killed that bird.
[212:55.75]Uh, I think.
[213:01.52]Oh, what's the right way here?
[213:03.06]That way or this way?
[213:03.78]The little wall jump.
[213:14.30]Cool.
[213:20.11]So how similar to this is it takes two?
[213:24.31]That's a good question.
[213:29.35]Okay.
[213:30.56]Do people go like... In that one too?
[213:35.76]I think so, yeah.
[213:36.32]It's very similar gameplay wise.
[213:47.93]Okay, we're here to stop a bomb train from reaching its target.
[213:51.64]Is this like a train heist?
[213:53.86]A sci-fi train heist.
[213:56.28]Sure.
[213:57.58]This is like, I feel like I'm playing 3D Flappy Bird.
[214:00.14]I forgot about that game.
[214:04.81]Can you just kind of like tap forward?
[214:13.93]This is going to be easy.
[214:14.69]No crashes at all the whole time.
[214:16.53]Watch.
[214:16.91]Guaranteed.
[214:17.39]Either one of us.
[214:18.29]Why did you say that?
[214:18.93]That's the train security defense.
[214:21.77]We need to blow it up.
[214:22.95]Why did you say that?
[214:25.75]I meant that going forward.
[214:28.83]From this point?
[214:29.87]Mm-hmm.
[214:36.76]The bomb is at the train's locomotive.
[214:38.58]Alright.
[214:39.36]Let's get it.
[214:40.40]I thought I was going to crash into you.
[214:45.27]Alright, we both had one.
[214:46.17]We're good.
[214:49.77]Why am I following you?
[214:50.79]That's a good question.
[214:53.99]Alright, if you had to save one and kill one, would you save Crazy Taxi or Panzer Dragoon Orda?
[215:05.28]Crazy Taxi?
[215:09.80]Because... I don't know, actually.
[215:14.28]I think crazy taxi created a world where I don't know the answer to that question my gut was crazy taxi and I don't know why it just it just was just because it's crazy taxi just it makes sense it's just the genre of arcade driving and kind of like that gta type of
[215:45.72]Run against the clock speedrun type game as well.
[215:51.52]OK, crazy taxi or jet set radio?
[215:54.28]Crazy taxi.
[215:58.04]Oh wait, do I get to keep the music from jet set radio?
[216:02.34]I mean, the whole game would be gone, so.
[216:04.36]Oh shit, then it's going to have to do jet set radio.
[216:14.82]How'd you die?
[216:16.44]I missed the jump.
[216:20.06]Oh, no.
[216:20.62]What do we do?
[216:21.70]Get your wings ready.
[216:23.40]No.
[216:23.54]Alright.
[216:24.64]Jet Set Radio or Crimson Skies?
[216:28.06]Jet Set Radio because I don't know what Crimson Skies is.
[216:30.10]Okay.
[216:31.10]Fair enough.
[216:31.52]Now that's an impressive sight.
[216:33.22]Get on that train now.
[216:38.50]Don't lose your balance.
[216:45.54]Oh, he's got to go.
[216:50.53]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[216:53.39]Did you ever play?
[216:54.25]Oh, shit.
[216:59.58]What was that PlayStation game that was like jet skis, the jet moto, your play, jet moto?
[217:07.51]Not really.
[217:08.43]I heard of it, though.
[217:14.03]Did you ever play Palm Rap or the rapper?
[217:16.05]Oh, that was one.
[217:16.67]That's right.
[217:17.07]That was the first game I ever really played on PS1.
[217:19.01]Okay.
[217:20.03]I found one.
[217:23.11]Did you do Um Jammer Lamy?
[217:25.56]No.
[217:26.48]Arguably as good or potentially better.
[217:37.39]Wait.
[217:38.69]Oh, wait.
[217:40.11]Where's the wingsuit?
[217:40.63]We're supposed to get in a vehicle.
[217:42.69]Oh, okay.
[217:49.74]I'm Jerma.
[217:51.04]We're actually play the eye.
[217:52.18]This is cool.
[217:55.29]I'm happy about this, but I'm not going to ask her.
[218:02.47]I'll never be able to get all of my quarters back.
[218:04.55]Get that power up.
[218:15.13]Oh hell yeah.
[218:22.61]Power up.
[218:31.34]Murder.
[218:52.42]uh alright if you went to the arcade when you were a kid were you the kind of person that put your quarters up on the cabinet to say next no I was not really I would usually
[219:12.06]I had the big cup of quarters, or I just put them in my pocket, and he would walk around.
[219:15.91]You know the end of DuckTales, the movie?
[219:19.25]It's an insanely specific reference.
[219:22.63]I don't know what I'm talking about here.
[219:24.55]Where he's at the very end, the guy's stealing a bunch of the money, and it's like his pockets are so filled with treasure, and he's just weighing them down.
[219:30.72]Okay.
[219:35.96]Yeah, just walk over.
[219:36.92]You didn't spend it?
[219:37.94]You just kind of held on to it?
[219:40.29]It's just it was so heavy that I was like little.
[219:44.57]And I said I wasn't going to die once, but I started talking.
[219:49.42]I was like small kid, obviously.
[219:52.38]And having like a pair of jogging pants with a handful of quarters that kind of actually weighed me down.
[219:58.48]I was probably five feet tall in like middle school into junior high school.
[220:12.25]okay when you were at the arcade and you saw the Mortal Kombat machine did you know how to do a fatality?
[220:17.35]I could do a ultimate combo with smoke Mortal Kombat 3 ultimate combo I would get up there and there would be big kids there older kids uh do I need to do something?
[220:38.27]wait no I can do this
[220:41.83]Get back in the water!
[220:43.83]Okay.
[220:44.25]You can't be in the water for- out of the water for that long.
[220:47.81]This is not the one you want.
[220:49.63]Unless you want to keep- you can keep jumping.
[220:51.51]I think that's what I gotta do.
[220:59.04]What's an ultimate combo?
[221:00.02]Uh, the ones that go like this.
[221:02.80]And then it says like 35 hit combo or something.
[221:16.42]See, I would just put money into the Mortal Kombat machine and just mash buttons and hope that a fatality occurred.
[221:24.52]They were hard to do in the old ones.
[221:28.54]I didn't understand that it was like a set of buttons that you push the same way every time.
[221:37.62]Fatalities were not simple to do in the old ones.
[221:52.24]I guess I have to... Am I going to pick you up?
[221:59.36]I think you have to grab this and I carry your own.
[222:07.47]Did you ever have any PCs you could put quarters into to play Counter-Strike for like 10 minutes per quarter?
[222:14.13]No, that sounds kind of... We never had like quarter ones.
[222:18.26]But like internet cafes, yeah.
[222:24.74]Am I going to be careful with you here?
[222:25.70]I think... is that it?
[222:32.10]Do I do anything else with you?
[222:40.19]I think I need to hit this.
[222:42.47]You do.
[222:44.53]Woohoo!
[222:46.80]And then there's a... oh, that was the flower you were using?
[222:49.68]I get to go to the magical fairy world, by the way.
[222:52.08]Jealous!
[222:55.91]Oh yeah, but I have, like, birds.
[222:57.51]Oh, that's a fucking bug.
[223:08.22]I have, like, my own baby bird.
[223:18.58]But I, um, oh!
[223:22.81]What is the best N64 game?
[223:31.90]I think I can grab that.
[223:34.30]Pretty bad.
[223:35.12]I don't know why, but that was it.
[223:39.22]Wait, just stand on it.
[223:49.78]Oh wait, hold on.
[223:54.18]I think I can break it.
[223:55.93]I pulled this over.
[223:58.79]I OK, I'm gonna give you a few weird ones.
[224:02.76]Of mischief makers.
[224:07.00]Nope.
[224:08.24]I think I can grab the egg somehow.
[224:12.89]Oh.
[224:14.21]Like if I if I raise it or something.
[224:18.19]Is that way?
[224:18.57]There's gotta be.
[224:19.99]What about these other birds?
[224:24.31]They're just cute.
[224:26.39]Oh shit.
[224:31.45]What do we do?
[224:33.62]Stick them on the... Maybe they'll fly?
[224:37.24]How do you drop them once you pick them up?
[224:39.62]I think you have to put them in a nest.
[224:51.29]Mischief Makers is really good.
[224:52.93]Obviously Mario 64 is amazing.
[225:01.97]GoldenEye.
[225:04.55]Alright, see, they just get up and run away.
[225:13.64]What is the tree interactable that you have, too?
[225:16.06]Also, what is the monkey one?
[225:17.20]Did you grab up there on top?
[225:20.90]Okay, you can grab those.
[225:23.12]What if I do this?
[225:23.73]Can I?
[225:25.13]Oh, hold on.
[225:28.19]Got it?
[225:30.79]No.
[225:31.25]You're a battering ram.
[225:34.07]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold that.
[225:35.59]Nope.
[225:36.99]Oops.
[225:38.41]Okay, grab it.
[225:43.72]Oh, then you throw it in the air and I crush it.
[225:51.14]Yeah, Turok was good too, yeah.
[225:53.60]Classic.
[225:54.44]Alright, ready?
[225:57.09]Oh!
[226:02.81]shit shit it's like it's triggered weirdly alright you tell me when right now we're not gonna hurt the bird we're just gonna hatch it alright three two one it's good
[226:30.31]I'd have to sit and look at a list of N64.
[226:31.65]It's been a long time since I've looked at a list of N64 games or thought about it.
[226:36.07]There's a lot of good ones, though.
[226:40.91]Cruisin' USA, Podracers, the other racing game that's like the city with the... God, what was the name of that one?
[226:54.69]Cruisin' USA was so good.
[226:55.79]Let us into a dead end.
[227:02.33]I can't believe it oh please tell me you know where to rush yeah like San Francisco rush I didn't play very many of the racing games banjo kazooie obviously yeah that's another one zoe sorry perfect dark I just wasn't expecting this when I left home this morning she's getting hit with some feels
[227:34.27]Were you one of those kids that bought tickets to Wild Wild West so you could sneak into the South Park movie?
[227:42.55]No, I was always afraid of getting in trouble.
[227:43.99]Yeah.
[227:47.60]Because I went through every... I did the Doctor Strange see every single outcome thing when I was younger.
[227:53.66]I was like, oh my god, if I do that, I'm going to get in trouble.
[227:55.42]What if there's a police officer in front of the door?
[227:57.80]What if the officer wants to know how old I am?
[227:59.42]What if he wants to see my ticket?
[228:00.52]What if an attendant sees that I don't have a ticket for this?
[228:02.80]What if somebody sees me?
[228:03.30]What if I have to go to the bathroom and I have to leave?
[228:04.46]How am I going to get back in?
[228:22.38]It's called neurosis.
[228:41.14]Yeah, I think I'm pretty neurotic.
[228:43.40]I don't think that's a secret anymore.
[228:45.50]This is really pretty.
[229:07.05]But yeah, I was the same way.
[229:08.93]I never snuck into a movie in my entire life.
[229:18.63]Because, I don't know, I was like...
[229:22.19]some movies some movie theaters it's impossible to do that anyway like if it's like a small movie theater it's like one hallway and the person that checks the ticket can like see down the four screens you know what I mean and some theaters are like 30 theaters yeah when you got line of sight hallways yeah when the attendant has line of sight on the whole theater that's actually very difficult you're right
[229:51.67]Merge with nature.
[229:55.25]I never wanted to sneak into like rated R movies anyways.
[230:06.00]Like I was the kid watching a kid's movie and then the preview for Mars Attacks would show and I'd have nightmares for weeks.
[230:13.22]So I didn't want to sneak into them anyway.
[230:20.47]Wait, am I gonna like mess with you now?
[230:47.73]Do I get to be the AR, the AI director?
[230:50.05]Hold on.
[230:52.97]What'd you say?
[230:55.90]I think I'm the AI director now.
[230:59.38]Yeah.
[231:01.94]Wait, do we have different screens?
[231:04.54]I'm on this one screen with you, but I'm controlling the environment.
[231:08.06]Oh.
[231:08.22]Alright, go for it.
[231:12.38]Yes!
[231:14.21]I'm sure nothing bad is going to happen to me while I'm standing on top of these spikes.
[231:23.26]OK, so now you can jump on this.
[231:28.42]There kind of is a lot of Rayman Legends in this.
[231:30.40]This is a very Rayman Legends-esque segment.
[231:40.45]I think we gotta time this.
[231:42.32]OK, I'm going to jump 321 jump.
[231:47.34]OK and jump.
[231:49.58]Oops shit.
[231:51.50]Alright, this this is cool.
[231:53.55]I like this.
[231:56.33]Alright alright and jump.
[232:01.29]And jump.
[232:04.69]And jump.
[232:06.67]Shit is that all you have to rotate.
[232:08.41]I think I think I have to rotate it.
[232:12.89]It's like, oh, that was my bad.
[232:15.05]That was me.
[232:21.98]I'm going to rotate it.
[232:28.58]OK.
[232:28.88]And again, OK.
[232:31.63]You got it.
[232:33.19]Sometimes I just got to dash back.
[232:43.40]let's see where we're at now rotate around can you do that as the gorilla and I think I go like that okay now you can do that can you get that one okay I can jump way higher as a gorilla
[233:10.19]Oh, it killed you?
[233:11.27]It killed... I'm fine.
[233:15.24]And jump.
[233:17.08]And jump.
[233:19.96]Spikes.
[233:25.70]Excellent.
[233:27.36]Oh my god.
[233:28.20]Monkey Mio, yeah!
[233:36.44]Don't break my concentration!
[233:40.84]Okay, three, two, one.
[233:45.13]Very good.
[233:47.59]Let me see what it does.
[233:48.15]Okay, I don't have anything.
[233:51.05]I don't think I can do anything here.
[233:58.07]Spin?
[234:01.27]Oh.
[234:02.76]Interesting.
[234:03.84]This is going to get ugly.
[234:06.82]Alright.
[234:08.94]You just adapt to me and I'll try to help you here.
[234:11.03]Yeah, I'll try.
[234:13.07]Which way are we going?
[234:14.45]I think we're going this way.
[234:15.31]Okay.
[234:19.90]Careful.
[234:20.28]You want a little more?
[234:27.94]Spin it when I jump over.
[234:30.52]I feel like we're going backwards.
[234:32.72]Yeah, we are going backwards.
[234:33.44]I said that with an Irish accent.
[234:35.02]Yeah, we are going backwards.
[234:37.60]Uh, now we're going backwards again.
[235:02.86]Maybe we should go around this little post.
[235:05.29]Yeah, there we go.
[235:14.13]Old to... Oh, you can move the bark.
[235:16.13]Yeah, let's get you a better view.
[235:17.29]Okay, bark is stationary.
[235:23.12]Okay, that's going to come flying down.
[235:26.08]I'm going to jump on go.
[235:28.80]Three, two, one, go.
[235:30.24]Okay.
[235:32.10]Okay.
[235:35.10]I'm a floating monkey, but I'm here.
[235:36.84]Hey, we did it.
[235:42.25]That was cool.
[235:43.95]That was fun.
[235:46.95]Oh, stomp the stump.
[235:55.28]There's even more?
[235:57.80]Attack?
[235:58.76]Oh, I can eat the bugs.
[236:00.16]Oh, crunchy.
[236:10.56]What happened?
[236:11.16]Never mind.
[236:14.46]Uh.
[236:16.13]Oh wait, it's me doing that.
[236:17.53]OK, so can you jump?
[236:18.79]Should you jump into this?
[236:19.57]You taste a bit like this is Donkey Kong.
[236:26.47]This is Donkey Kong.
[236:30.61]Some of the hardest shit in the entire generation of that game.
[236:35.32]Of that not game that um.
[236:38.46]The generation.
[236:45.58]Some of those jumps in the barrels were pixel perfect.
[236:47.72]They were crazy.
[236:51.69]Oh, yeah, when I would play like Donkey Kong or another one of those platformers, I would lose on like the second level because I remember, you know, Green Hill Zone and like Sonic.
[237:01.28]But when you get to the flood level, I die and I can never beat it.
[237:04.88]But I thought that was like the whole game.
[237:07.79]like when I when I was like seven years old I thought that was literally like the whole game dude the red light green light area that was probably the hardest level in that entire game was that was that first one or the second one I remember can you move it further to the left so that the water level goes all the way up yeah
[237:39.76]First one, yeah.
[237:45.92]Oh.
[237:46.74]That looked like grass.
[237:51.82]Marble Zone made me break my 3DS as a kid.
[237:56.40]I'm just imagining a little kid getting so mad and just like... Smashing their 3DS.
[238:07.85]Thank you.
[238:10.05]Oh.
[238:12.79]I think I have to protect you.
[238:13.89]Yeah, you have to protect me.
[238:22.01]OK.
[238:24.45]Thank God the devs didn't put an oxygen meter in this game.
[238:30.03]I think you can hide in this.
[238:30.99]OK.
[238:40.50]clean um where's the other one yeah alright clean angry oh hold on not yet hold okay go hold on okay oh I don't nothing else I can do
[239:14.91]Nice.
[239:18.34]This does feel very Rayman-y, doesn't it?
[239:20.70]It does, yeah.
[239:21.44]Very, very Rayman-inspired, I feel like.
[239:31.21]I have emerged.
[239:41.24]You are no longer the god of the forest.
[239:47.38]I hope we get a musical section.
[239:48.72]That would make it really right now.
[239:51.62]Or it's like timed jumps with music.
[239:54.12]I hope we actually get a rhythm game.
[239:55.64]That'd be awesome if there was a full-on rhythm heaven.
[239:59.58]Hey, there's a side story coming up.
[240:03.60]By the way, Zoe, for a story about an impending ice age, like, where's the snow?
[240:08.76]Did you ever play DDR at the movie theater?
[240:11.56]No, I couldn't do it.
[240:13.50]I don't know.
[240:15.14]Something about looking at the arrows on the screen and moving my feet at the same time just never translated in my brain.
[240:20.46]I could dance.
[240:21.26]I can just dance normally, but not when looking at a prompt.
[240:24.94]You could dance if you wanted to.
[240:27.83]Were you a DDR guy?
[240:29.21]No, I mean, I liked the idea of DDR, but I had no coordination.
[240:40.94]like I would try to play like I had a home DDR you know like I had the PlayStation DDR but I was just awful
[240:51.99]Yeah, something about looking at the arrows and translating that to the pad was just... was never gonna happen.
[240:59.25]Even on the easy mode, where one arrow happens every eight seconds.
[241:03.93]Wanna do one?
[241:04.85]You wanna snooze?
[241:20.21]Uh, yeah, we might.
[241:20.75]We probably should.
[241:22.17]Until we get through this section.
[241:24.30]Snooze.
[241:31.10]Alright, ready?
[241:31.54]Mm-hmm.
[241:35.81]I actually didn't even get a prompt for it yet, so... So, it's me versus you.
[241:42.89]Let's go.
[241:44.66]What just happened?
[241:45.96]We both died?
[241:48.04]Yeah, I threw a bomb at you.
[241:50.72]You have to catch it.
[241:51.62]Ready?
[241:51.96]Go.
[242:15.46]It's kind of like, uh, what was that name of that game where you hit the balls back and forth really hard and it was dong, dong, dong, dong, dong.
[242:22.55]Uh, Lethal League.
[242:23.91]Yep.
[242:25.55]What an awesome game that was.
[242:26.91]I wonder if that game, could that be a comeback?
[242:30.39]Let's get that game back.
[242:33.15]They made another one, didn't they?
[242:34.73]They did.
[242:35.05]Uh, throw it.
[242:46.91]We did it.
[242:47.67]This is the same deal.
[243:10.56]Oh, okay.
[243:10.98]I have to throw it.
[243:13.16]Shit.
[243:15.46]We have to jump and throw it at the top.
[243:18.91]Alright, ready?
[243:21.99]I missed it.
[243:28.17]Oh, shit.
[243:29.05]Did I get it?
[243:35.48]Okay, here it comes.
[243:39.04]Got it.
[243:43.31]What?
[243:45.09]What happened?
[243:45.81]I fell through?
[243:56.20]Holding grenade.
[244:07.54]What happened?
[244:08.85]You gotta go up to the... You gotta go up to the thing and hold Y.
[244:13.47]Oh, I thought I was throwing it.
[244:14.47]I thought I wanted to throw it back to you.
[244:15.78]I don't know why I did that.
[244:24.69]This is the bomb disposal.
[244:25.91]Alright, we're good.
[244:32.96]Let's amp up the heat, shall we?
[244:35.70]Let's make things a bit more dangerous.
[244:39.70]And let wild emotions run, well, wild.
[244:46.55]Can't wait to see how this plays out.
[244:49.41]I just got burnt immediately.
[244:53.42]Yes, okay.
[244:55.52]This one is going to be hard.
[244:56.50]Alright, we got to pay attention.
[244:57.40]Ready, here we go.
[244:58.58]Yep.
[245:02.71]I'm just gonna wait for you.
[245:03.87]Yeah.
[245:04.97]I'm ready.
[245:05.33]I threw it.
[245:06.73]Where did it... It went over my head.
[245:08.75]Okay, I just run with it.
[245:12.93]Alright, throw it to me once you get to the corner.
[245:17.79]There you go.
[245:24.53]Oh my god, I didn't get it.
[245:26.35]Alright, I'm gonna try and stay like... Throw it before you turn right.
[245:35.07]I'm ready for it.
[245:37.86]Okay, coming back.
[245:39.22]I can't see it.
[245:39.76]Alright, I'm gonna get through this one.
[245:42.26]Oh, fuck!
[245:46.82]This one's really difficult.
[245:48.20]Alright, ready?
[245:49.82]Here it comes.
[245:56.73]I'm ready.
[246:01.06]Coming back to you?
[246:02.30]Yep.
[246:03.24]Oh my god!
[246:04.28]I fucking fell off.
[246:06.44]I'm ready for it.
[246:10.76]Oh my god!
[246:11.80]I can't do this.
[246:13.14]It's like chewing gum and fucking walking and singing at the same time.
[246:15.54]Yeah, it is.
[246:16.00]Alright, ready?
[246:16.88]Doing two things at once.
[246:22.57]Hold.
[246:22.89]I'm ready.
[246:28.09]Here I come.
[246:33.39]Okay, other side.
[246:34.27]You.
[246:34.47]Alright, let's go.
[246:39.51]Hey, we did it.
[246:42.77]I did it.
[246:43.77]Is this a... This character, is this a weekly reference?
[246:47.11]It must be GLaDOS.
[246:48.49]Oh.
[247:10.38]Are you ready?
[247:14.01]Alright.
[247:17.71]On you.
[247:20.19]Throw it whenever it gets close.
[247:24.83]I'm ready.
[247:26.07]To you.
[247:27.83]Oh, we just smoked that guy.
[247:29.85]We didn't have a chance.
[247:32.28]Wait, how did that happen?
[247:34.68]I didn't think they could...
[247:38.77]I didn't do this.
[247:39.46]This is my neck on the line, not yours.
[247:41.46]You're going to have to just get him on the line as soon as possible.
[247:44.50]Hey, we're back.
[247:46.24]Hello, let's continue.
[247:48.20]OK, oh man.
[247:52.97]Alright, you ready?
[247:55.25]Yeah, let's get it.
[247:56.31]Incoming and no.
[248:03.45]Oh, you have to jump.
[248:04.17]Shit.
[248:05.49]You.
[248:06.21]I got it.
[248:07.47]Coming back to you.
[248:11.47]Fuck.
[248:11.69]Shit.
[248:11.87]I freaked out.
[248:14.29]I don't know why me saying coming back to you was like we're playing basketball.
[248:18.68]I don't know.
[248:19.58]Ready?
[248:20.24]Here it comes.
[248:26.30]Okay.
[248:28.56]You go.
[248:29.46]I'll jump and throw to you.
[248:30.58]Ready?
[248:34.35]I've got it.
[248:34.65]I'm opening.
[248:35.27]Opening.
[248:37.45]Oh, boy.
[248:40.25]Oh, nice.
[248:40.79]Okay.
[248:41.89]Alright.
[248:43.21]It's on my side.
[248:45.03]Let's go.
[248:45.43]I'm ready.
[248:45.77]Alright.
[249:06.71]When I go up, I'm gonna do it.
[249:08.09]Yep.
[249:09.03]Hurry.
[249:09.81]Oh, I'm gonna fall.
[249:15.38]Oh shit.
[249:15.90]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[249:16.98]I didn't mean to throw it to you.
[249:18.28]Are we supposed to detonate it on her?
[249:21.00]Oh fuck, I'm chewing gum and fucking walking.
[249:25.41]Hold on.
[249:28.47]I'm ready.
[249:33.66]Oh, okay.
[249:34.40]What are we going to do?
[249:35.64]I think we both have to fold that up.
[249:37.22]We both have to get up there.
[249:38.21]Alright, ready?
[249:40.03]Yep, ready.
[249:40.59]Alright, I'm going to... Ready?
[249:44.72]Ready.
[249:45.32]Alright, when I go up, I'm going to throw it.
[249:53.26]Wait, it wasn't on you?
[249:56.09]I wasn't up yet, so you just... Oh, shit.
[249:59.19]Okay.
[249:59.71]But it's my bad.
[250:00.77]I got... Dude, I got stuck.
[250:05.65]Let's go.
[250:06.27]Alright.
[250:06.67]What happened?
[250:09.68]What did it blow up on me?
[250:22.18]This is fucking hard.
[250:28.10]Oh, my God.
[250:28.94]Okay, I... I'm good.
[250:31.38]I'm good.
[250:31.88]Coming back to you.
[250:35.74]Got it.
[250:36.80]Alright, you can throw one up when we get up here.
[250:39.81]Ready?
[250:40.03]I'm ready for it right now.
[250:42.73]Alright, let's go.
[250:44.21]Finish her, Zoe!
[250:45.25]So, did we win?
[250:49.21]Yes.
[250:50.03]Jump!
[250:50.85]What?
[250:55.73]We did it first try.
[251:03.37]I would actually like a whole game of that.
[251:05.87]That was really fun.
[251:08.84]I like that.
[251:10.42]I think minigames in which you have to pass something to somebody else is just inherently fun.
[251:15.26]Where are you on your snooze here, by the way?
[251:18.78]37 seconds.
[251:19.82]Yeah, we should take it.
[251:21.22]So perfect timing.
[251:22.67]Perfect timing.
[251:26.08]Very cool.
[251:32.36]That was a good one.
[251:35.26]It was hard, but it was fun.
[251:36.56]I'm going to get a tea.
[251:37.42]I'm going to get a peppermint tea.
[251:41.88]Sounds good.
[251:42.78]And I'll see you in three minutes.
[251:44.90]See you in a minute.
[251:50.90]I'm going to get a good peppermint tea or ginger tea.
[251:53.03]What do you guys think?
[251:57.91]Ads incoming.
[252:04.18]Yeah, Peppermint, you're right.
[252:06.56]And when you're right, you're just right.
[252:07.68]Alright, Bearby.
[252:27.24]Amen.
[253:47.79]you
[254:57.64]Thank you.
[255:56.05]Thank you.
[256:30.38]Hello, hello.
[256:38.80]How you guys doing?
[256:39.37]You guys doing good?
[256:39.85]Yeah, I definitely needed a chill day after that horror movie shit.
[256:50.70]Horror game shit.
[256:56.10]I woke up in muscles hurt that haven't hurt in like four or five years.
[257:07.18]Alright.
[257:07.82]I am back.
[257:08.98]How's it going?
[257:10.69]I am also back.
[257:13.47]Maybe get to the end of this section and see how we're feeling.
[257:15.21]Another like hour or so.
[257:20.95]Yeah, I think it's good.
[257:23.24]I wonder how far we're probably halfway just about halfway what's the um it's like 10 hours right 10 to 12 chat chat said that it's it depends on like how much extra stuff you do but it's like 12 plus hours I guess somehow I saw people saying it was like a short game but I feel like I saw a couple people say it's like 12 to 16 hours depending on how long you take yeah but that's like long to me
[257:48.86]I think this is more of an experience game than it is a, you know, like, gaming, gaming, gaming game.
[257:56.69]Yeah, it's not like a free-to-play game that you can grind for 400 hours.
[258:03.77]It's kind of like a big interactive, playable, walkable, character-interactable movie.
[258:12.46]That's pretty much every single video game.
[258:16.22]Alright, cool.
[258:18.46]Uh, so where are we now?
[258:26.52]We are.
[258:29.92]In the bridge zone.
[258:39.77]Still need to find the boss and was that technically the boss?
[258:43.99]No, that was just like a side story.
[258:48.45]That was like a optional.
[258:50.37]That was probably my favorite part of the game gameplay wise.
[258:53.15]Yeah, I think that there's a lot of places like when chat made us go back to do one.
[258:58.72]I feel like there's a bunch of places people will miss.
[259:01.82]Potentially, if they're just not, some people are not exploration like look in the corner brained.
[259:06.72]Yeah.
[259:09.06]And it'll be a lot shorter if you don't go do all those.
[259:12.78]We're going down.
[259:21.64]That looked correct.
[259:23.49]It did go down.
[259:24.47]Is this where we came from?
[259:29.21]No, right?
[259:31.37]Oh, no.
[259:32.11]Okay, there we go.
[259:41.64]Can I fly?
[259:42.50]Oh, okay.
[259:46.46]We just have to turn left.
[259:50.10]Easy for some of us to do more than others, I think.
[259:53.52]Wait, I think I can.
[259:54.06]Can I grab it?
[259:57.07]Yeah, it was just a ledge to the left.
[260:01.27]Is the camera like bugged there?
[260:02.81]Like it doesn't seem like it's supposed to face you away from the ledge you're supposed to jump on.
[260:09.33]Can you smash this?
[260:15.63]Unless we're not supposed to be here.
[260:17.11]Maybe we're not.
[260:23.37]I guess not.
[260:26.51]Oh, there's something activated over here now.
[260:34.34]The Inns are marching?
[260:37.86]What that look like?
[260:38.54]Alright, we might need to take a breather.
[260:49.59]They're like, they're winded.
[260:53.37]Yeah, we've been sprinting back and forth for five straight minutes.
[260:57.48]Something to break.
[261:24.22]Someone said, why are they breathing like that?
[261:25.88]It's okay.
[261:28.02]None of us remember what it sounds like.
[261:30.72]Oh my god, this thing's alive.
[261:32.83]I guess I'm steering this thing?
[261:41.15]Oh, I think, yeah, you have to fight these things.
[261:42.97]Oh, I gotta, okay.
[261:46.30]Oh, shit.
[261:49.80]I think you're fighting and I'm driving.
[261:55.39]The giant stick bug.
[261:57.41]You killed us.
[262:03.33]What?
[262:03.55]Do we... What's the goal there?
[262:06.33]Do you have a charge screen?
[262:09.43]Oh shit, I do.
[262:10.28]Yeah.
[262:28.25]Kill them.
[262:29.77]Alright, I got this.
[262:35.99]I played plenty of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Turtles in time.
[262:38.74]I'm good at throwing enemies.
[262:39.84]Probably the best game for Super Nintendo.
[262:44.34]This is hard.
[262:45.74]I can't turn it that hard.
[262:46.56]He just got snapped.
[262:50.22]Did my head explode?
[262:53.75]Okay, I gotta be better about this.
[262:55.89]I gotta be way better about this.
[262:58.18]Hey, when you get stabbed, can you turn into the side that you get stabbed on?
[263:02.02]I think I just have to hug left.
[263:04.10]Okay.
[263:27.40]I'm going to stay on the left side.
[263:30.66]Yeah, now I don't have to turn.
[263:37.30]Okay, now you get stabbed.
[263:43.78]Right side or left side?
[263:46.90]Right side?
[263:47.30]Right side.
[263:49.26]I can't turn.
[264:06.18]I gotcha.
[264:09.00]Because if I don't keep the monkeys off of you, you can't control the thing, right?
[264:11.88]I think that's the... Oh, shit.
[264:15.38]I think we're about to get cut-scene here in five seconds.
[264:19.17]Uh-huh.
[264:23.05]Oh, I've lost control!
[264:29.09]But you're the captain!
[264:40.31]Those hit some major arteries.
[264:41.49]Is one player driving more or is it balance?
[264:49.24]I feel like it's... I feel like we get different driving opportunities.
[264:54.14]It's been about 50-50, it feels like.
[264:55.80]This is the impending Ice Age.
[264:58.34]We're getting closer to the finale.
[265:02.36]To the Ice King?
[265:04.14]First, the Monkey King.
[265:07.21]That's Chad.
[265:07.67]Oh, time for us to split up because we get into an argument.
[265:32.92]All I'm trying to do is tell you what I wrote so that we can be somewhat prepared.
[265:45.34]The Ice King will come to us.
[265:48.16]The world is being devoid of all things in color and warmth because we're not working together.
[265:52.76]We're not being creative.
[265:53.78]We're being cold.
[265:54.64]Being cold.
[265:55.34]I get it.
[265:55.66]I'm freaking out too.
[266:04.19]You're not supposed to feed the monkeys at the zoo.
[266:06.73]Somebody just said, imagine a gun.
[266:09.29]That must have sucked.
[266:28.53]I don't think that would help us though.
[266:29.79]That's not going to help right now.
[266:32.05]It's like a pre-existing story.
[266:34.21]I don't think a single handgun is going to help versus the giant 500 foot tall stick bug.
[266:39.89]Ooh, hold on.
[266:56.25]Screenshot.
[266:57.09]Looks good.
[266:59.13]Looks really good.
[267:11.96]So we're still in my story or one of my stories that I made?
[267:15.68]Yeah, this one is still your fantasy with the Ice King and the Monkey King.
[267:30.82]But... I think... Does that mean we have two bosses?
[267:35.75]Or... I wonder if the GLaDOS counted as one.
[267:44.05]Unless... Maybe there is a Monkey King or something.
[267:54.14]I think the answer to this question is no.
[267:56.70]But... Did you play Wukong?
[268:00.31]Uh, no, I did not.
[268:01.63]Did you?
[268:02.59]I played it for the first maybe five or six hours or so.
[268:07.37]It was good.
[268:07.97]I wanted to play it more.
[268:09.05]I just didn't really... I didn't... You know, you have to really commit to those Dark Souls type kind of games.
[268:14.49]Oh, yeah.
[268:15.27]I did not.
[268:15.79]I wasn't ready to commit to it.
[268:17.94]Uh, how do I get to you?
[268:18.92]Um... Oh, here we go.
[268:27.70]I'm blocking the water.
[268:31.27]Does that help you?
[268:37.25]Um... I'll probably be able to jump on the wheel.
[268:41.76]Do I just have to jump over this?
[268:43.54]Oh, there's a roof.
[268:45.70]Should I... I think I'm making a dam.
[268:49.32]Okay.
[268:50.74]And then if I... You hold it.
[269:00.94]grab it okay you can stand in that water if I change into the fish what is the what is the benefit of holding that I don't know I think you're just good I have to just like ramp over um oh I think you have to boost me like when you let go it does like a burst so I have to wait till you're right through it
[269:33.57]and then shoot me now hey there we go I love how you can like you can you can always spy on me or I can like spy on you to see if we're doing the like the right thing or not yeah that's funny screen cheating it is funny how after like four hours you get used to just looking at one half of the screen though
[270:04.75]Oh shit.
[270:06.69]Yeah, you don't really miss the other half.
[270:09.98]Hey, that's a good testament to that means they made the game well for this because I have not cared the whole time we've been playing.
[270:19.64]They made vertical video gaming.
[270:21.73]They figured it out.
[270:24.11]This is for the iPad generation.
[270:25.87]It's a portrait mode game.
[270:33.19]But written by boomers.
[270:36.96]because usually it gets a little claustrophobic on split screen stuff like this but I feel like I've been I've not felt that way at all the whole time oh these piranha fellas again hmm oh this might be a timing thing it is okay
[271:07.69]Okay, I'll give you another second or two between each one.
[271:13.11]Can you make it to the thing from here?
[271:15.24]Yes, I can.
[271:16.52]Okay.
[271:17.98]And then I probably have to go to the other side.
[271:19.26]I can start grabbing stuff.
[271:24.06]I can pull this down.
[271:24.86]Okay, so I need to like...
[271:37.96]do that and then hop over here and then I can grab this one alright oh I think it was too close to the edge yeah I think he got clipped yeah people that the writing isn't good in the game
[272:01.73]Yeah, but you know what?
[272:02.71]I got to be really honest with you.
[272:04.85]I have not really been paying that much attention to it.
[272:08.37]I've been kind of just playing.
[272:10.59]I honestly didn't even know the character's names until an hour ago.
[272:15.29]So I'm kind of just having fun with the game, you know?
[272:20.95]I think I can... What's that doing?
[272:27.17]Is this low enough for you to jump onto?
[272:30.14]I'm... let me see.
[272:36.03]But yeah, like the... Again, I think that the writing for a game in which you become a pig who jumps through the air with magical farts is like... You know.
[272:50.34]It's not really the reason why you're playing the game.
[273:03.77]I mean, is the dialogue a little cringy?
[273:05.55]Yeah, it sure is.
[273:07.89]But are people a little cringy?
[273:10.08]Yeah, they sure are.
[273:16.70]So I don't think it's unrealistic.
[273:25.32]But I've been more so paying attention to the... Yeah, the visuals, the...
[273:31.06]the combinations of the screens.
[273:33.38]The dialogue is just kind of there.
[273:34.68]Yeah, I mean, they just, they have the characters say things so you're not just playing in silence for the whole game.
[273:44.43]I guess you could turn off subtitles and drag the dialogue down.
[273:48.17]Oh my goodness.
[273:53.95]Don't touch the lock.
[273:55.47]And just make up your own story as to why you're doing all this.
[274:01.90]that would be alright that would be kind of weird if you're like I don't like this story I don't like this dialogue turn it down I'll tell the story so the two of us uh two uh young women were uh fighting their way through the forest I feel like that's it that's a that's pretty weird okay this is the trial to gain an audience with the monkey king sure let's rise to the occasion
[274:27.85]Yeah, nobody plays, like, Trine and goes like, oh, the riding in Trine, like, sucks.
[274:33.50]I don't know what I'm doing here.
[274:36.14]I can grab them?
[274:40.72]Oh.
[274:42.28]Does the height matter for... Okay, I think I have to, like... Maybe it does.
[275:00.39]Oh, it's blue, yellow, red.
[275:05.45]So it's in the background, so I need to do like.
[275:11.73]So you need to hit that down to the middle and then I have to grab it like red needs to go.
[275:16.17]This left needs to go first.
[275:20.12]Wait now.
[275:21.96]Blue, yellow, red.
[275:23.70]Then I have to grab it when it gets to red.
[275:28.70]And then I have to grab it when it gets to yellow.
[275:32.97]Ah, it's on a timer.
[275:33.53]Alright, let's restart.
[275:43.54]Reset it.
[275:45.28]So which one has to go first then?
[275:46.26]Because if it breaks after a certain amount of time.
[275:48.32]I'm going to do yellow first.
[275:50.06]Alright.
[275:55.74]Then red.
[275:59.02]Then blue.
[276:00.42]Smash it!
[276:06.43]There's more of those.
[276:07.29]Yeah, I would I would say like the based on the boss fights and stuff we've had, like the boss is like just I'm quoting 80s music or whatever, you know, like that.
[276:26.28]I think the game knows what it is.
[276:30.93]make it rain I'm quoting 80s music that's like a funny way to put it I think I think true cringe is when things are presented in a in a way that's not self-aware I feel like this game knows that it is look I mean just look at the fucking screen
[276:54.78]Yeah, I mean, it's fine.
[276:56.74]Am I going to say, oh my god, the writing is fucking phenomenal.
[277:02.32]This is the monkey on screen, you know what I mean?
[277:12.25]Is it actually a music level?
[277:13.17]No way.
[277:13.71]The dance floor.
[277:25.77]It is a dance kill.
[277:27.03]Let's go.
[277:27.97]Let's do it.
[277:28.41]I feel like that has a Snapchat filter face.
[277:39.08]You know what?
[277:39.40]I agree with chat.
[277:44.50]When you go out and play Borderlands 4, come back and look at the writing in this game.
[277:49.12]You might think differently.
[277:50.49]Wait, we have to match that.
[277:51.65]It's just Simon.
[277:52.19]Oh, I didn't look.
[277:53.33]Neither did I.
[277:57.28]No, no.
[277:58.32]That's not what I showed you.
[278:02.86]This game is my nemesis.
[278:05.86]I actually am pretty good at these.
[278:08.20]I am awful at these.
[278:11.67]This might take a minute then.
[278:12.87]What are we doing?
[278:18.13]Alrighty.
[278:19.13]Let's turn it up.
[278:28.87]Oh, shit.
[278:31.57]That's the maximum I can do.
[278:35.70]Well, it looks like we got one more, so we'll see.
[278:58.67]Uh... I... I copy you?
[279:09.16]I think you... I... I think... I trusted you.
[279:17.77]Okay, back.
[279:18.51]Then right, then up, then back.
[279:21.17]Okay, okay.
[279:21.87]I forgot it already.
[279:22.65]I was too busy laughing.
[279:28.81]you know you go you go here here here if I wasn't a king I'd be a great instructor love it it demands skill to mirror the king but can you do the kong gun
[279:52.42]I feel like that all the time I feel like this I just feel like that I don't know why just like a tree with thin ligaments I think just like long arms and like the emoting with your arms I don't know okay I think we can't bump into each other oh yeah yeah we're playing like reverse tron
[280:21.65]Multiplayer snake.
[280:22.63]Alright, so let me take the right side of the screen.
[280:27.85]You'll take the left side of the screen and then we'll crossover.
[280:31.31]Oh shit, wait only this side is available.
[280:33.09]Alright, how about?
[280:34.59]Oh man, hold on.
[280:35.40]Yeah, you go in first bottom.
[280:38.52]I'll clear these this one.
[280:40.56]I'll get out of the way.
[280:42.60]Grab that one.
[280:44.84]I'm just going to grab this one and the next one, OK?
[280:50.62]And then I'll get these, I'll get all three.
[280:54.30]Good comms, good comms, good comms.
[280:59.50]I'll get these two.
[281:00.12]There's more?
[281:03.50]I'm gonna, I gotta, I gotta flatten this out.
[281:08.20]Okay, I cleared most of your path.
[281:15.20]Very good.
[281:22.01]more oh shit there is more alright uh let me I'll get these two alright I'll get out of the way where you going where you going where you going I'm gonna stay up here okay got it alright I'll clear the rest
[281:52.87]The loop is getting pretty big.
[281:55.11]And then I think we have to.
[282:02.05]Oh, get up.
[282:02.31]You have to get them all on the dance floor.
[282:05.52]That's cute.
[282:08.26]Yeah, I like that one.
[282:11.84]Right on.
[282:12.70]You got it.
[282:13.84]Now let's get freaky.
[282:15.90]Let's get the groove.
[282:17.06]Let's disco.
[282:22.67]Oh, we have to do what he does.
[282:27.65]Okay.
[282:28.63]Okay.
[282:28.81]This is WarioWare.
[282:54.12]I want a whole level like this down right you're in one true now that was slick let's turn up the heat and make it hot like the arabian desert as sweet as somebody called him bonzi buddy focus focus me your focus
[283:37.91]It's really nice of him to use directions relative to us and not to him.
[283:43.57]Yeah.
[283:49.27]Didn't they just make a whole movie about this guy recently?
[283:51.33]Did they?
[283:51.95]It's gonna get hard.
[283:53.09]Some big UK pop star?
[284:02.67]oh that's right um hold on duh duh we got stars directing our fate and we praying it's not too late millennium Robbie Williams here
[284:28.18]Ooh.
[284:28.40]We're friends again.
[284:58.89]That was the Monkey King.
[285:10.43]Yeah, you can do some good dance moves.
[285:11.87]Whoa, that was weird.
[285:30.30]poof oops wrong character there we go I definitely did have bonzie buddy like I was the one who installed it on all my family's computers
[285:50.99]What was the Bonzi Buddy song?
[285:54.11]It was like... I'm crazy all for the love of you.
[285:59.26]I just killed you.
[286:00.80]Yes.
[286:02.50]Or was it like... I'm half crazy all for the love of you.
[286:15.47]it might be a stylish carriage I can't afford a marriage but you'll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle built for two where are you there was a co-op door here oh I didn't even see the co-op door is there something with uh with this guy
[286:42.43]I think that was just what I pulled.
[286:43.31]I think we can just open it.
[286:45.25]Can we just open it?
[286:45.87]Yep.
[286:51.44]Did you ever actually use an AOL disc when you were a kid?
[286:55.22]Yeah.
[286:55.40]Because, like, I remember getting them and I would just use them as projectiles.
[287:04.00]Just, like, throw them around your room.
[287:05.61]Yeah, just throw them around.
[287:10.36]we never had actual AOL like I never got to hear the iconic like you got me I never got to hear it myself other than the commercials I did a long time ago
[287:33.54]It felt so foreign and so... Like, you knew that this was kind of the beginning of an entirely new era, but you almost didn't know it yet.
[287:44.61]You had that feeling where it was almost scary in a way.
[287:48.87]It was like, wait, we can communicate now?
[287:52.12]Yeah, it was like, wait, we can communicate with it now?
[287:53.78]Get rid of it.
[288:06.26]This is beautiful.
[288:14.30]AI is like the same way.
[288:15.99]Yeah, it does kind of feel like this is getting... We're in like a new... I'm going right through the keyhole.
[288:22.03]Cool.
[288:23.91]Oh, Peter Pan.
[288:27.00]Speaking of Trine, this kind of looks like Trine.
[288:29.72]This does kind of look like Trine.
[288:34.84]Oh, uh, I think you have to guide me.
[288:37.44]Oh.
[288:38.48]Do we have to mash the door?
[288:44.75]Okay, this needs to be three circles.
[288:46.11]Got it.
[288:46.51]Next one.
[288:47.71]This needs to be that one.
[288:52.41]Uh, partial circle on this one.
[288:54.05]Yep.
[288:57.29]Go ahead.
[289:00.09]Oh, shit.
[289:01.03]Okay, we get it.
[289:01.54]We get it.
[289:04.34]Okay, this one's three circles.
[289:07.90]Good.
[289:09.25]That one is tree.
[289:11.73]Tree.
[289:13.41]This one is partial circle.
[289:15.11]Uh-huh.
[289:19.57]And then mad face.
[289:24.69]Yep.
[289:25.01]Yeah, you get a cube puzzle.
[289:31.45]Oh, no, I'm here with you.
[289:35.26]I do have a cube puzzle.
[289:37.46]Oh boy, this is going to take some brain power.
[289:39.90]I'm usually pretty good at cube puzzles, though.
[289:42.32]Thank God, because we would have been here for an hour if I had to do this by myself.
[289:45.83]Okay, raise this one.
[289:51.47]Okay, now raise this one.
[289:53.49]Alright, now raise this one.
[290:01.06]I'm so glad you're doing this.
[290:04.99]Alright, now raise this one.
[290:09.07]I would've- I would've just- I would've not been paying attention to the game.
[290:11.82]I wouldn't scream into somebody in the shot.
[290:19.98]You nailed it, dude.
[290:21.18]Excellent work.
[290:26.24]I've played a lot of cube puzzle games in my day.
[290:35.31]I think I have to sneak in here.
[290:38.59]Wait, you can fit as the little... That's funny.
[290:40.31]The little fish guy.
[290:40.85]This feels like a fake video game.
[290:41.59]I don't know why right now.
[290:42.67]It feels like someone had a huge game jam and then combined everything into one.
[291:08.96]Yeah, it's like Tinkerbell and Red from Final Fantasy VII were just modded into a game.
[291:15.16]Do you think they had like eight different teams and they were just like, make whatever the hell you want and we'll figure out how to connect it to the narrative?
[291:23.18]Maybe, and that's actually really cool.
[291:25.39]If that's how they did it.
[291:28.19]What are we doing here?
[291:32.21]Uh, fish?
[291:35.07]Oh, fish.
[291:45.30]Feels like it was made in dreams.
[291:46.62]Yeah.
[291:50.14]Hey, we were just talking about that.
[291:58.04]Uh, not that way.
[292:01.77]Oops.
[292:02.41]Oh my goodness, that was loud.
[292:06.51]We just had this conversation in World of Warcraft.
[292:25.31]All millennials were scarred by Christmas Story.
[292:28.21]I don't know if I was scarred.
[292:39.20]I definitely thought it was an interesting movie.
[292:44.20]I definitely thought it was not possible, but never wanted to attempt it.
[292:50.19]Really, Mio?
[292:51.29]Again with the explosions?
[292:53.45]And this could be my biggest one yet?
[292:55.06]My family would put it on TV every single year.
[292:58.94]I like my uncle's house.
[293:01.34]They would watch it every Christmas.
[293:03.56]It's kind of a staple, isn't it?
[293:04.60]It's a staple for watching Home Alone every Christmas.
[293:13.64]OK, what is your favorite Christmas movie?
[293:18.86]Home Alone and Home Alone 2 back to back on the same day on Christmas Day.
[293:23.96]OK, it's hard to beat Home Alone, but.
[293:27.90]And I don't think that this necessarily beats Home Alone, but I would say that my favorite Christmas movie is Jingle All The Way.
[293:36.35]That's a good one.
[293:40.37]I'd say that's a pretty high up there.
[293:41.67]Yeah, for sure.
[293:43.63]Put that cookie down, I'm dead.
[293:47.18]Muppet Christmas Carol is.
[293:48.34]I would say during the week.
[293:51.82]Of Christmas.
[293:56.06]Right.
[294:00.22]Well, it is a... I don't know.
[294:04.38]What is this glass made of?
[294:05.64]How did I not make this jump?
[294:13.82]Oh my god.
[294:24.16]Hurry!
[294:27.30]Oh, it's freaking turbo time.
[294:28.38]I don't know how I stepped on the key, but didn't pull the key.
[294:31.66]Ooh, a greenhouse?
[295:04.73]I think we just try to get to the end.
[295:06.49]No, you fool.
[295:22.38]There's no way you can take the full brunt of a star.
[295:28.97]It'll kill you instantly.
[295:31.57]I'm vaporized.
[295:33.25]My sister thought that was the funniest line in the entire franchise.
[295:38.52]She just thought the way that it was said and how dumb it was.
[295:43.26]She quotes that all the time.
[295:47.70]No, there's no way you can take the full brunt of a star.
[296:02.12]Oh, you're talking about, uh... Dinklage?
[296:08.74]Uh, yeah, I'm talking about Dinklage.
[296:13.44]I had to think for a second what you're talking about.
[296:15.04]For some reason I thought you were talking about, like, the, like, Star Wars.
[296:21.93]Uh... I don't...
[296:31.32]Oh my goodness.
[296:33.30]That was a lot of people that got smoked.
[296:39.32]They don't have the protective plexiglass.
[296:43.80]Yeah, okay, but they made a teen game with murder in it.
[296:50.10]This game has been very family-friendly, and ooh, puzzles, and what do we do, and look out, and look at all these fun little pigs.
[296:57.18]These, uh, the books were written for older audiences, okay?
[297:00.37]This is young adult fiction.
[297:14.63]and then you have to jump on oh god um and then oh wait wait for the next blast yeah oh my goodness you gotta get out of there good timing okay uh oh boy oh boy oh boy you're in trouble oh boy
[297:45.23]I don't know if I should have gone.
[297:46.49]That was probably a mistake.
[297:47.57]We're good.
[297:50.49]Remember inside?
[297:54.21]Yeah.
[297:56.11]Inside was good.
[297:56.69]Oh yeah.
[297:57.57]Inside and like Little Nightmares and Little Nightmares 2.
[298:06.29]Little Nightmares 2 kind of sucked.
[298:09.39]Wasn't all good?
[298:10.93]I didn't like it.
[298:12.33]First one was fine.
[298:16.16]The first one was great.
[298:17.22]I didn't play the second one though.
[298:26.06]I forgot which person I was for a second.
[298:30.06]When it gets this bright, it gets a little confusing.
[298:40.70]I feel like... Did I tell you to play inside?
[298:46.96]I would want to say that's correct.
[298:49.30]I think it was like, this shit's so crazy.
[298:54.20]I think you said just get to the... You said get to the ending.
[298:57.62]And I was like, oh, okay.
[299:01.79]It was a get to the end game.
[299:04.15]It definitely is a get to the end game, I think.
[299:12.37]It was really good.
[299:12.97]I think a lot of games tried to kind of...
[299:16.28]riff off of it what's the uh the one everybody thinks of when they think of the side scroll horror game um oh we've got that withering rooms of course limbo I don't think I ever even like played limbo limbo was good too
[299:42.78]How did we die the first time?
[299:46.87]I think I jumped off.
[299:50.23]So probably me jumping off.
[299:52.71]Okay.
[299:56.23]Oh, we have to active block.
[300:00.44]Yeah, we activate and then we have to move.
[300:10.51]You gotta play Withering Rooms.
[300:18.20]What is it?
[300:19.06]Withering Rooms.
[300:24.13]What is it?
[300:24.97]Like, what kind of game is it?
[300:26.61]I can't stop hitting the button.
[300:34.45]Why did it turn me around?
[300:35.23]Wait, are you back behind me?
[300:37.14]Yeah, where am I?
[300:46.24]I had to come back.
[300:48.86]OK, there we go.
[300:57.70]Withering Rooms is a side-scrolling, clock tower, Resident Evil, Dark Souls inspired, video game.
[301:07.38]That's a lot of hybrid games.
[301:09.94]It is.
[301:14.32]This is a Fall Guy level.
[301:16.77]It kind of is, yeah.
[301:20.59]Oh boy.
[301:22.45]Oh, you're already up there.
[301:35.20]That's great, it's it's a little.
[301:38.12]It's a little crunchy.
[301:39.72]But that's what makes it so good.
[301:42.42]No, it's came out last year.
[301:45.83]It's, I believe, a solo dev.
[301:47.83]And that's crazy because it's a 20 plus hour campaign.
[301:51.37]Oh, really?
[301:52.31]Yeah.
[301:55.73]Oh.
[301:57.23]Oh, shit.
[301:58.71]Those make a shield, apparently.
[302:00.19]Oh, makes a shield.
[302:08.62]Yeah, didn't... I remember the... Okay.
[302:16.24]Do we have to hit them all?
[302:17.56]Maybe we have to... Either we have to hit them all or we have to, like, time it.
[302:23.78]Yeah, I think we just have to keep them all activated.
[302:27.05]Oh, they block us too, though.
[302:28.65]Okay.
[302:31.49]Why did I die?
[302:37.45]What is killing me?
[302:38.09]We need to reset.
[302:39.59]Okay.
[302:40.38]Alright, yeah.
[302:41.50]Reset, reset, reset.
[302:42.18]Hold.
[302:43.34]Hold.
[302:48.24]okay alright let it break go through oh man we had the right idea too we kind of like mirrored each other which was strange
[303:20.25]Good.
[303:22.45]Got it.
[303:27.44]Jeez.
[303:27.82]And we're going to go right now.
[303:33.14]This really this is a Fall Guys level.
[303:36.58]Oh, please.
[303:37.84]Oh, well, I thought I couldn't go through that.
[303:39.94]No, I was in front of it.
[303:41.20]What?
[303:46.30]Let's go.
[303:46.83]We got a checkpoint.
[303:52.26]Come on.
[304:11.69]Oh, my God.
[304:12.51]Wait, what?
[304:13.01]I'm so confused.
[304:18.03]Is it... Okay, we have to time it.
[304:20.89]It's not really firing at us, though.
[304:22.23]It's just kind of there.
[304:23.67]Like, we have a shield that we can move.
[304:28.93]You have to use it, like, right when the blast is coming.
[304:31.67]Oh, okay.
[304:32.59]I thought you had to activate it at the kiosk.
[304:50.68]Hold on.
[304:52.60]Wait.
[304:54.36]I went already.
[304:54.84]I'm sorry.
[304:56.99]Wait, do we have to take turns using our shields?
[305:02.79]I think so.
[305:05.39]Okay.
[305:07.15]You go first.
[305:08.55]Okay.
[305:08.87]Hold on.
[305:09.21]Wait.
[305:10.77]Wait for the first blast.
[305:13.07]Okay.
[305:15.65]You use yours.
[305:23.40]I'm running in front of you.
[305:29.62]Here we go.
[305:30.22]First try.
[305:31.31]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[305:37.01]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[305:50.94]like every every time they like fly through the air and scream it's big team rocket vibes honestly these side missions are the best part of the game without a doubt I think I think that's a good place to to call it solid five hours through the campaign
[306:20.32]I'm getting hungry.
[306:26.03]Good chapter.
[306:27.67]Solid side mission.
[306:28.53]That one was good.
[306:35.82]We'll probably get this done in another one or two sessions, I bet.
[306:40.73]yeah I want to know where they go after the book because if you do a sci-fi book and then one fantasy thing what do you do for the rest of the game yeah did you play um it reminds me of oh god what was the leshy game which one with leshy the leshy uh chat knows I don't know inscription oh inscription yeah
[307:10.54]Did you play Inscription?
[307:11.90]I did.
[307:12.46]I beat the first area or two of Inscription, and then when it got to the... I mean, I don't want to spoil it, but the last area with all the... It was just too hard for my brain.
[307:23.84]I couldn't do it.
[307:24.54]To be fair, you played the best part of it, because it definitely kind of... The first section was the best, for sure.
[307:34.96]Yeah, once you get through, like, the, oh, this is the, this is cool.
[307:38.54]I think it just became kind of a card game, and I, you know, not like a not, oh, it just became a card game, but it became that, well, I don't even want to say it because it's, I don't want to spoil it, nobody's played it.
[307:53.67]I wonder if this game has a similar...
[307:58.20]Like, it can't just be the sci-fi level and the fantasy level for, like, five more chapters, probably.
[308:04.26]We could, I guess.
[308:05.28]I think it's very good.
[308:08.06]And I'm definitely into seeing the rest of it, so... Yeah, no, it's fun.
[308:12.21]Maybe at some point in the next, like, four or five days, if you're around.
[308:16.99]Probably not.
[308:17.29]I'm going to be taking another... I'm going to take, like, two days off here.
[308:21.65]Yeah, it's... Starting another game, definitely...
[308:27.17]There's a, the list is growing, let's say.
[308:31.58]Yeah, I definitely want to see the end of this, though.
[308:33.18]I'm very interested.
[308:34.38]I think the side missions are really fun.
[308:36.24]And I think the concept is cool.
[308:39.08]I'm just saying it's nice that there's new stuff out that's good.
[308:42.88]Like Monster Hunter and Wilds has been good.
[308:47.69]Actually, I rolled credits on it yesterday.
[308:50.39]It was fun.
[308:51.59]So you're ready for a high rank.
[308:52.97]I got to do that, too.
[308:53.91]I was talking to Vinny about it.
[308:56.01]We both need to be at high rank.
[308:59.05]My hottest Inferno take is that I actually like the campaign.
[309:05.49]I don't think there's nothing wrong with the campaign.
[309:07.75]It's great.
[309:08.69]Everyone is saying it sucks.
[309:12.35]I just wish it didn't take so long to get through.
[309:14.49]I don't know if this is like, oh, you're effectively complaining about cutscenes, but I wish there was a caveman mode where I could just like, hey, I smash head against wall and don't know things anymore, but now I play.
[309:28.59]Yeah, I think it'd be definitely better if the whole thing was playable in multiplayer instead of people having to kind of like jump through the hoops.
[309:37.73]Yeah.
[309:40.06]It's still good, though.
[309:40.84]I really like it.
[309:41.42]I think it's really good.
[309:42.52]And I'm definitely down to keep playing it some.
[309:46.48]But thank you, Etalyx, for playing, obviously.
[309:52.35]Yeah, it was fun.
[309:52.87]And we'll finish it up.
[309:53.43]We'll play it again.
[309:55.88]Sounds good.
[309:57.94]Thanks, everybody.
[309:58.72]Hope you all had fun, too.
[310:01.64]We've got ads in two minutes.
[310:02.66]You've got to get out of here.
[310:04.06]I'm just kidding.
[310:05.26]Wait, what did you say?
[310:06.50]I said ads in a minute 45.
[310:07.36]You've got to get out of here.
[310:08.86]I know.
[310:09.04]You've got to end your stream and win two minutes.
[310:10.60]Otherwise, you're going to get ads.
[310:11.78]Nah, I can still snooze it.
[310:16.99]Yeah, I'll hit you up in a couple days.
[310:18.75]We'll figure something out.
[310:20.23]Alright.
[310:20.57]Sounds good.
[310:21.71]Good time, everybody.
[310:23.05]Good night, Jerma Chat.
[310:24.65]Take care, dude.
[310:28.57]Alright.
[310:32.71]That's going to be it.
[310:35.13]Thanks for hanging out.
[310:36.09]Thanks for chilling.
[310:38.55]Chill day today.
[310:40.38]Still had a lot of fun, but I think this is a good game just to kind of hang out and play.
[310:51.72]No stream tomorrow.
[310:54.31]And maybe no stream on Tuesday.
[310:56.15]We'll see.
[311:00.24]But definitely nothing tomorrow.
[311:16.85]He must be retiring.
[311:22.20]No, no, no, no, no.
[311:24.13]I already retired.
[311:25.17]Don't you understand?
[311:26.51]You can't retire again.
[311:28.01]I'm just retired.
[311:30.53]That's it.
[311:31.85]You can't, it's not twice.
[311:35.85]In my retirement, I happened to be streaming more than I did when I wasn't retired.
[311:41.77]Isn't that just fucking strange?
[311:52.04]That doesn't make any sense.
[311:58.02]Hey, it makes sense to me.
[312:01.38]It makes sense to me.
[312:08.95]He truly is an enigma.
[312:14.86]You found the love for it again outside of it being a job.
[312:17.90]Well, I don't want to be a broken record and talk about this a million times in a row.
[312:22.89]Like I said, I promised I wouldn't, but it's removing the pressure of needing to stream or having to figure out something to do or something that's going to be really interesting or a performance or a lot of streams are like that, especially four or five years ago.
[312:43.46]And I'm treating the stream now like a broadcast more than a show.
[312:50.72]And I feel like I probably need to say this a few more times just because obviously the nature of streaming in this, it's a, it's a lot of different audience, different crowd pretty much every few weeks rolls through.
[313:08.31]But it's not that I didn't like streaming before I stopped and slowed down a lot in 2023 and 24.
[313:16.29]It's just as of this year, I just took the philosophy of this is a broadcast now and I'm just doing what I do, whatever I want to do.
[313:28.06]And if I wake up in the morning one day and I'm just like, you know what, this is fun.
[313:32.38]I'm just going to do it.
[313:33.20]And I decided to give it kind of a try.
[313:37.58]And I feel like it's going pretty well.
[313:39.80]I feel like I'm having a lot of fun with it again.
[313:41.97]Again, not that it wasn't fun before.
[313:57.50]Do you think you still want to perform in the future?
[314:00.59]I will always want to do that.
[314:04.52]And a lot of streams sometimes, even the ones that, some of the recent ones that you've seen, I turn it on a little and, you know, you just, you fuck around, you make, you get a little high energy.
[314:14.93]I've been there.
[314:20.94]And there's always things that I still want to do or, but at this point, it's just whatever the heck I feel like doing and however long or however much or with just nothing attached to it, I'm just going.
[314:46.67]What about the House Flipper Invitational 2?
[314:50.19]Well... I have a very big surprise for you.
[314:53.76]Um... This would be House Flipper Invitational 3.
[314:58.68]So you may have missed one and I would suggest you go watch it.
[315:01.92]Because it was very good.
[315:02.96]Uh... I am in the process of working that out.
[315:15.93]And House Flipper Invitational 3 is tentatively, that is tentatively a go.
[315:22.61]It's not going to be for a little while.
[315:27.81]But it's going to be crazy.
[315:30.20]Let's just put it that way.
[315:37.40]It's going to be a little different than the last time.
[315:40.14]Anytime I did any of these things, anytime I do anything, I always want it to be a little different.
[315:48.40]So this one will be very different, just like the last one was a little different than the one before it.
[315:53.73]And this is going to be kind of the culmination of the whole thing.
[315:56.27]This is the third one.
[315:57.21]It's the trilogy.
[315:59.53]So I'm going to go all in.
[316:01.09]So we'll see how fun it is.
[316:03.19]I got a bunch of ideas.
[316:07.87]Are Ster and Etalyx invited?
[316:09.15]Do I really need to even... Do you need to ask that question?
[316:13.91]Absolutely.
[316:16.03]There's probably going to be, hopefully...
[316:19.19]I don't want to give a number, but it might end up being bigger than the last one.
[316:24.51]So, we'll see.
[316:29.85]And it will be different enough where it's not just going to be another, oh, make this house, you make this house.
[316:36.37]I've got ideas.
[316:37.80]I've got a vision.
[316:39.94]And like I said yesterday, you've got to trust the vision.
[316:47.44]Alright, guys, I'll see you soon.
[316:48.96]Take care.
[316:49.34]Have a great night.
[316:56.21]And I'll see you guys in a few days.
[317:00.33]It's very possible that there's a stream on Tuesday, but probably not, but you never know.
[317:07.43]Plan on the next one for sure on Wednesday.
[317:19.79]Take care.
[317:20.57]Ta-ta.
[317:22.28]Call your mother.
[317:26.78]Call your mother.
[317:28.40]To all you non-fucking Bostonians, you know what I mean?
[317:32.90]See you later.
[317:51.33]Thank you.
[318:25.65]you
