[00:55.27]Am I keeping the beat?
[00:56.85]Am I keeping the beat?
[00:58.49]I can't tell.
[00:58.91]I can't hear it.
[01:01.26]Am I close?
[01:05.12]Nah.
[01:06.08]Probably not.
[01:07.30]Hi, everybody.
[01:14.65]Early stream on Twitch.
[01:16.95]I mean, we're an hour early.
[01:19.03]That's because I wanted to play for a little while.
[01:20.87]And I wanted to start early because I wanted to start early.
[01:23.47]Sometimes you start early.
[01:24.23]Sometimes I start late.
[01:26.63]Whatever.
[01:27.09]You know what I mean?
[01:29.45]I'll see you guys in a minute.
[01:30.29]We're gonna just go right into it.
[01:31.85]You guys already know the game we're playing.
[01:34.55]I'll talk about it.
[01:35.41]Just talk about it in a minute.
[01:36.75]You know what I mean?
[01:37.19]Just like get yourself cozy.
[01:40.58]Bundle up one of those blankets.
[01:42.50]You know, get another blanket.
[01:43.58]Bundle up.
[01:45.20]Stuff it underneath your armpits and put it under your chin.
[01:47.74]I know you're balancing your iPad with the back of your hand.
[01:51.36]You know what I mean?
[01:51.78]You're holding your iPad up with your chin down.
[01:54.98]Get one of those iPad holders.
[01:56.38]I mean, they suck sometimes, but they make it a little... Your device is probably heavier.
[02:00.72]But, you know, don't strain your neck so much.
[02:05.93]I'll be right back.
[02:06.85]See you soon.
[02:53.45]all right what's today tuesday where's fake we'll talk about fake german we're gonna talk about everything I haven't seen you guys in like two days three days somewhat has happened oh boy oh boy now we move on to the game here hope you're nice and settled guys we're about to get dialed up to 10.
[03:23.56]You know these streams.
[03:25.12]These Monster Rancher streams, they get dialed the fuck up to 11.
[03:27.86]You know what I'm saying?
[03:30.02]We sit there, we watch the same two animations with training.
[03:33.53]It gets dialed up to 100.
[03:37.21]It's like, I'm talking about Pog Champs.
[03:40.65]Look at this blank screen you're looking at here.
[03:42.85]Look at that bitmap back there of that image.
[03:46.03]It's blurred out.
[03:49.35]The music's back.
[03:50.50]Yes, it is.
[03:50.92]The music ain't going anywhere.
[03:51.90]I need it to be engulfed in the Monster Rancher universe.
[03:58.92]Yeah, but the music's turned down though, so that's okay.
[04:00.88]Just pretend it's not there.
[04:04.60]Anyways, yes.
[04:05.36]This is probably going to be the last Monster Rancher 2 stream for a while.
[04:12.10]There's quite a few other games to play at the moment.
[04:15.33]My Monster Rancher 2 addiction is still here.
[04:19.33]Still exists.
[04:21.10]But we'll get as much as we can done tonight.
[04:24.59]And maybe we'll come back to Monster Ranch 2 some point later in the week.
[04:29.43]Or maybe I'll move on to Monster Ranch 3.
[04:31.03]You know, we'll do a little thing.
[04:32.45]We'll do a poll at the end of the stream tonight.
[04:35.73]And we'll gauge if anyone wants to see this anymore.
[04:38.51]Like we did the last one.
[04:40.57]We'll see, right?
[04:41.51]What is it going to go?
[04:43.83]Play a better game.
[04:45.81]Don't you guys play a better game?
[04:46.83]Come on.
[04:49.42]This is a better game.
[04:50.52]This game is better than most of the games that are out right now.
[04:54.08]I stand by that statement.
[04:59.42]But, uh... Thank you for the bits, by the way, Pyre Snips.
[05:03.39]One dollar.
[05:04.87]I guess because I'm sitting here, I might as well just... A couple just came in and I'm having to be looking at it.
[05:09.05]Stix, Renegade, thanks for the one dollar.
[05:10.57]That face when you get a $10,000 bill for a colonoscopy.
[05:15.57]Thank God for insurance.
[05:18.31]That is... Yeah, that's fucking terrible.
[05:22.05]Thank God you... Thank God it exists.
[05:24.03]Thank God you know you can get that kind of shit.
[05:25.63]You know what I mean?
[05:28.39]But, yeah, it's not good.
[05:30.09]Thank you, Styx.
[05:30.69]Thank you, AtMasterFish, for $15.
[05:34.25]They say shamrock a bunch of times.
[05:35.73]Thank you.
[05:37.17]For the $15.
[05:37.67]Appreciate it, man.
[05:39.39]Morning Maple, thanks for the $1.
[05:40.85]You're two hours early, and for me that means 10pm instead of midnight.
[05:44.60]Thanks, Uncle Jeremy.
[05:45.38]Please do... Please don't be too late, though.
[05:47.68]I have...
[05:48.85]to go to Glasgow tomorrow.
[05:50.31]We're not going to be too late.
[05:51.81]Don't worry.
[05:52.21]We'll be moderately late.
[05:55.97]Thank you, Admaster Fish, again, for the $1 here.
[05:57.97]And Merciful Wit for the $0.57.
[05:59.15]Say that Jeremy had been accepted to grad school in Denver and Dublin.
[06:03.56]Ireland to study international relations.
[06:05.28]Which one would you pick?
[06:08.44]Wait, what?
[06:09.84]Oh, you've been accepted to both.
[06:11.82]Well, do you live in Denver or do you live in Dublin?
[06:15.40]You know what I mean?
[06:15.94]Like, that's kind of a tough question.
[06:18.48]Are you traveling across the... Are you traveling across the whole world?
[06:22.69]Or is that like in your backyard?
[06:23.95]You know?
[06:26.93]I'd say go to... Go to Ireland.
[06:29.61]You know?
[06:31.86]Do it.
[06:33.12]It's a whole new adventure.
[06:33.96]A whole new place.
[06:35.14]A whole new space.
[06:38.50]You know?
[06:39.36]I would do that.
[06:40.76]If you're up to that.
[06:41.50]You know?
[06:41.98]Do you.
[06:43.35]So, let's go to the lab.
[06:44.67]Let's open up the fucking lab.
[06:46.67]Put our lab coats on.
[06:47.77]Go to freeze.
[06:48.85]Revive.
[06:49.73]We need to make some money.
[06:51.39]We'll do some more C-ranked cups or B-ranked cups with Cura.
[06:54.61]I want to make a bunch of money.
[06:55.42]We're going to get a new monster.
[06:56.34]Because he's alright.
[07:05.32]But what happened with the bathroom?
[07:06.38]Don't worry.
[07:07.71]You'll do it.
[07:11.61]Beanbag Sonic is no longer with us.
[07:13.17]No, he's not.
[07:16.67]But I'll wait for more people to come in before I talk about the future of this series.
[07:22.48]Brought it up a little bit, like a minute or two ago.
[07:25.36]Get to A rank.
[07:26.02]Let's go back to the ranch.
[07:30.06]We got training to do.
[07:35.17]Get to the end game.
[07:35.87]Well, that's the goal.
[07:36.81]The goal is to get to a position where we can have a new monster.
[07:40.71]Go to third generation and see what happens from there.
[07:43.71]Alright, he's soft right now.
[07:50.51]That's alright.
[07:53.00]Am I enjoying this?
[07:54.44]I love this game.
[07:56.78]These games are a ton of fun.
[07:59.42]They're just cute and they're interesting enough where we can just hang out and play them.
[08:05.74]So, let's see what we got here.
[08:07.52]Monster.
[08:09.93]We need life and defense, I would say.
[08:13.65]Life, defense, and power are the number ones.
[08:19.43]When's the next battle?
[08:20.83]We got a C cup, B cup.
[08:24.78]We could probably do the C. We could probably just do one of these B ones.
[08:31.96]Try it.
[08:33.16]Not this one, though.
[08:34.78]What's the next one after that?
[08:37.57]That's the official cut.
[08:38.47]Maybe we'll try to go for this one.
[08:41.19]$3,000 disk chips.
[08:47.66]Yeah, so this is gonna be the last Monster Rancher stream you're gonna see for a little while.
[08:53.10]Sea of Thieves just came out.
[08:54.75]A Way Out is coming out.
[08:55.99]Far Cry 5 is out or coming out soon.
[08:59.81]We're gonna go back to PC games for the next few weeks at least, probably.
[09:05.34]So don't worry, if you're a fan of this, this will come back.
[09:09.62]I'm not done with Monster Rancher, especially because there's at least one or two more games in the series I want to play.
[09:16.63]So, in the meantime, let's train his life.
[09:22.38]Life and power, probably, right?
[09:25.60]Or life and defense.
[09:26.54]Well, let's do...
[09:28.95]So I was told that these are more efficient.
[09:32.63]That if you want to do training with the drills, do the ones that have two.
[09:37.44]It's not that big of a deal to lose a little bit of one stat.
[09:41.70]So we're going to do power and life first.
[09:43.70]I always get it back.
[09:49.82]Have I played Vermintide 2?
[09:51.22]Fail.
[09:51.90]Okay.
[09:53.76]I have played Vermintide 2.
[09:55.56]It's pretty fun.
[09:59.59]They're more efficient, but more tiring.
[10:03.15]We'll get it.
[10:04.89]Yeah, we're also going to talk about what's going to happen here in the next week or so.
[10:08.82]We're going to do a game show on stream.
[10:12.40]If you're curious, we were talking about it last night.
[10:14.24]We're going to do something weird.
[10:18.04]But anyways, oh, this is for me.
[10:19.35]Got you a shoe.
[10:21.79]Thank you, Kira.
[10:24.91]Where did he get this?
[10:28.68]Seems kinda tired.
[10:29.46]Alright, we'll go to bed.
[10:30.28]I mean, there's enough people here that have shriveled.
[10:35.74]We can spread the word.
[10:38.28]We're doing a thing, probably next week, where I'm going to pre-record an entire livestream.
[10:46.36]Okay?
[10:47.18]So, not an old stream, not a stream you've already seen before.
[10:50.28]I'm gonna just sit here for like four hours and play a game and just do a stream.
[10:56.11]I'm going to do a bunch of weird shit to it, but I'm going to do a full pre-recorded stream.
[10:59.65]I'm also going to broadcast that, right?
[11:02.63]Broadcast that whole pre-recorded stream while I'm here.
[11:06.67]I got my mic.
[11:07.81]I'm watching it with you.
[11:09.41]The only difference is I'm going to be in chat.
[11:11.97]So I'll be chatting in the chat room as somebody you don't know.
[11:16.75]And the goal of the stream, the entire stream, is to find out which one I am, who I am in the chat.
[11:24.84]We're gonna put in a bot where you can accuse somebody.
[11:28.28]And I'm not gonna tell you who the fuck I am.
[11:30.64]I could be anybody.
[11:32.54]I'm gonna be enjoying the stream with you, watching the pre-recorded stream.
[11:36.91]So, if you accuse somebody in the chat, and you're wrong, you're gonna get timed out for like 30 to 40 minutes.
[11:45.31]So, you gotta use that accu- Don't fucking use it for no reason, you know what I'm saying?
[11:55.70]We were talking about it last night just sounds like a stupid idea that I want to do We were talking about all these different ways to swindle everybody But yeah, eventually and if nobody gets it in the four hours, then I'll reveal it It's gonna be a fucking mess and I can't wait
[12:16.65]nobody chat yeah so like people are gonna be on my side too they're gonna be so many people writing such obvious I don't have to do anything I'm just gonna be I'm gonna be a regular person in chat I'm gonna be writing luls you know to when something funny happens I'm gonna make a couple of comments here and there and look part of the deal for me
[12:36.69]is I can't just sit there silent.
[12:39.09]I have to do at least, at the very least, like two or three messages every couple minutes.
[12:44.40]You know what I mean?
[12:44.86]Like I have to be actively participating.
[12:46.80]I sound relatable.
[12:53.36]He's getting old.
[12:54.10]He's starting to lose a step or two here.
[12:58.90]Yeah, and by the way, people are saying, well, we're gonna hear your keyboard.
[13:03.44]No, because I'll be here watching the stream, and I can like chime in.
[13:08.20]I'm gonna pitch shift the actual stream.
[13:11.34]So the Jeremy that's talking on stream is gonna kind of sound like this.
[13:15.60]So you can decipher who's talking, and I'm gonna chime in and be like, oh, well, that was interesting, wasn't it?
[13:19.10]Oh, by the way, no, none of you are even close.
[13:22.00]I'll be here.
[13:26.89]Let's do defense in life.
[13:32.83]No, I'm not going to Pitch Shift him up.
[13:34.17]I'm going to Pitch Shift him down.
[13:35.40]Because when you Pitch Shift up, it's irritating.
[13:47.02]Level... Only plus three defense?
[13:49.22]Why does he suck now?
[13:52.49]Yeah, I'm trying to think of what's going to happen if... What happens if somebody wins?
[13:58.19]I was thinking about that.
[14:01.81]There's a lot of weird moving parts.
[14:04.27]Because we want to have it where you can't just spam.
[14:09.69]Oh yeah, I'm going to accuse everybody.
[14:13.81]We might have to do this.
[14:16.15]And for the sake of making it actually work, it might have to be sub only.
[14:21.95]Otherwise it could just be a total mess, right?
[14:24.55]And I never turn on sub only mode, but I feel like this is a scenario that it would actually function for what it would be functioning for.
[14:32.65]And that's to, like, kind of control the chat a little bit, so it's easier.
[14:36.03]Or maybe we'll do it twice, right?
[14:41.35]Like, maybe we could do it two different times, where maybe the first hour or two of the stream is sub-only mode, and then, like, I'll have another account, and we'll do it just absolute nonsense mode.
[14:53.56]Because how would you, how would you ever, like, keep... It's just gonna be fucking carnage in the chat.
[14:57.64]How are you gonna keep track of anything?
[15:06.21]That'll be such a mess without sub only on.
[15:13.99]Making stream pay to win.
[15:15.58]No, we're gonna do two different versions.
[15:20.52]Uh oh, he's old now.
[15:21.58]48 hour follower mode.
[15:32.97]Is my account- Yeah, I would have to like sub to myself.
[15:35.93]But that's the thing, I could like give my- I don't even know if it's legal on Twitch.
[15:41.66]Like, can I give myself bits and like react to it on stream?
[15:46.48]You know what I mean?
[15:47.12]What if I like made another account and I like subbed myself?
[15:50.51]And gave bits to myself?
[15:51.99]What if I like paid myself a fucking like 500 bucks?
[15:54.93]And I'm like, oh thanks dude, whoa, huge!
[15:57.73]But now that I'm saying that, how are you gonna know that's me?
[16:01.83]You can't.
[16:04.73]I can't do that?
[16:06.91]It literally says you can't.
[16:10.17]It's money laundering?
[16:13.57]Twitch takes a cut.
[16:15.60]If I buy a subscription to myself, I'm losing money.
[16:19.26]It's a net loss.
[16:22.70]If I give bits to myself, isn't that just me deleting money from my bank account for no reason, right?
[16:35.90]There's no realistic reason why it shouldn't be allowed.
[16:38.18]I mean like what?
[16:40.68]Bits are what?
[16:41.22]At least like 20% of revenue?
[16:43.75]So if I paid myself $100 in bits, I would just delete $20 permanently that I'm never gonna get back.
[16:49.97]So what's the problem?
[16:53.27]Maybe I can like ask Twitch to give me like a couple of fake subs.
[16:57.57]I don't know if that'll even work.
[16:59.05]It's worth a shot.
[17:04.58]Alright, what we got?
[17:05.32]Is he tired?
[17:06.75]Let's go to bed.
[17:11.49]You always lose money when laundering it, but how would that be money laundering?
[17:16.36]Isn't the point of money laundering to hide money?
[17:18.85]I would just be throwing money, I would be attaching, this is what's going on here.
[17:23.13]I'd be attaching a 100, a hundred dollars in singles to a boomerang.
[17:28.91]And it would be pretty loose, it would be attached very fucking loosely.
[17:31.97]And I would just whip the boomerang and it would come back to me and tons of bills would just fall out and I would grab it.
[17:38.12]What's the difference?
[17:38.64]That's not money laundering, that's just being dumb.
[17:44.56]Let's do this one more time.
[17:45.52]We'll do power and... I need power and speed and then we're gonna do speed normally just to get the extra... To not have to level down.
[18:02.73]Have Kim do it?
[18:03.68]Yeah, somebody else will do it.
[18:05.52]It's fine.
[18:05.82]It won't be me.
[18:07.28]I'll go next level money laundering.
[18:10.34]You know, the way that it actually is done.
[18:11.86]I'll have like some business or person do it for me.
[18:15.31]But I end up getting the benefits.
[18:21.45]No, it's not money laundering.
[18:22.65]I was just using my money boomerang.
[18:27.73]Let's do speed.
[18:30.21]When is that tournament coming up here?
[18:35.81]Breaking Bad.
[18:38.49]Confessing to crimes on stream.
[18:40.87]How is this a crime?
[18:46.08]Plus one speed.
[18:47.06]Give me a break, man.
[18:50.22]We have you on tank.
[18:57.89]We can do an Errantry, right?
[19:02.15]Probably should do one.
[19:04.44]When's the next battle?
[19:05.52]No, we're not doing a D. Go to Errantry.
[19:09.46]Let's try...
[19:14.39]Donating half my money to Twitch is laundering.
[19:20.11]I don't know how that's even possible.
[19:25.41]Laundering money.
[19:27.43]No, it's me pretending to be another person and giving money to myself, pretending to be that person so I can hide in the crowd.
[19:34.36]That is money laundering.
[19:35.34]That's what I'm describing.
[19:37.04]Huh.
[19:39.62]we're gonna have to think of a different solution all right let's go to uh what do power in life I'm gonna say power in life I think that's the one to choose here let's go
[20:09.56]Local streamer runs massive money laundering scheme.
[20:12.98]And he shits his bathrobe.
[20:17.49]Open up a Swiss bank account.
[20:20.43]What if I, like, borrow somebody's account, right?
[20:22.33]Couldn't I do that?
[20:24.79]No, you can't.
[20:25.33]Like, people get banned from World of Warcraft for doing that, right?
[20:32.62]Can't you, like, not share your account?
[20:34.24]I can't, like, borrow somebody's World of Warcraft account.
[20:37.18]What the fuck am I supposed to do?
[20:38.54]What if my mom... Okay, what if my mother... This was... What if my mom makes a Twitch account?
[20:44.14]Right?
[20:45.16]And then she, because she loves her son so much, decides to subscribe with that account.
[20:50.64]And then, Oh, Jeremy, I, I can't remember my password.
[20:54.86]I don't know.
[20:55.16]Can you set up a two factor authentication for me?
[20:57.98]I just not sure how that works.
[20:59.06]Of course, ma what's your information.
[21:00.22]Let me do it for you.
[21:01.46]And I log into work, her account and I'm on her account.
[21:03.74]And while I'm there, I happened to participate in my live stream because she wanted me to, I'm just checking to make sure her chat room features work right.
[21:13.84]To make sure she can talk.
[21:16.66]Right.
[21:19.81]And then I give her her account back, I set up two-factor for her, and I just, you know, I've just had a couple of things in the chatroom once, you know, it's whatever.
[21:32.72]That would work!
[21:34.64]That is the alibi.
[21:35.48]That's not an alibi, that's what's happening.
[21:40.34]You're gonna fish your own mother's Twitch account.
[21:49.34]Yeah, I can gift somebody a sub, so what about if I gift my mother a sub?
[21:55.68]I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
[21:57.06]I'm going to talk to a Twitch partner support person.
[22:01.78]That's going to be the oddest fucking question they've ever heard in their life.
[22:05.67]Can you imagine being one of the people that gets the Twitch partner emails?
[22:09.09]Hey, I'm doing something fucking stupid where I subbed myself and make it a game show and people have to find me in my chat.
[22:15.69]Can you let me do this or is that illegal?
[22:19.22]They get like questions on like what the bitrate should be.
[22:21.79]Or like, hey, I'm having problems with my stream.
[22:25.73]Is Spencer here?
[22:28.31]Somebody get Spencer in here.
[22:32.19]Tell him to ask his boss.
[22:43.88]But anyways, we're kind of derailing, but that's the plan.
[22:48.80]The plan is for me to hide in the chat while we all watch my livestream, and you have to find who I am, and if you guess wrong, then you get timed out from the chat.
[23:00.53]My stat and crit... We gotta get a new monster here soon.
[23:03.88]At this point, we're gonna have to just farm shitty tournaments and try to make, like, 15 grand.
[23:10.54]He didn't fail that, did he?
[23:11.50]No.
[23:15.87]He did it.
[23:16.21]We already know how this works.
[23:17.33]Success.
[23:20.41]New tech, though.
[23:20.87]We got a new tech.
[23:23.91]Hopefully we didn't run into Satan.
[23:28.05]I have to think of a prize for winning, right?
[23:30.93]If you win, I don't know, maybe like a... I'll send you like a personal video.
[23:35.44]I'll send you like a 30 second like... Okay, here's what we'll do.
[23:39.86]Okay, here's... Hellwall sucks.
[23:40.94]We'll kill him.
[23:42.08]Here's what's gonna happen.
[23:43.50]So, remember that stupid iPad game that Peter Molyneux did?
[23:47.10]Where if you get to the center of the cube, you're gonna find a thing that will change your life.
[23:53.57]And when you got to the center, the guy that got to the center of the cube, it was just a video of Peter Molyneux telling him how great he was.
[24:00.69]And telling him that he's gonna be like God or something.
[24:03.59]Like, that's what I'll do.
[24:04.55]I'll be the cube iPad game from Peter Molyneux.
[24:07.53]So whoever like wins, I will send you like a Peter Molyneux in the suit.
[24:11.53]Like you did it.
[24:12.67]Congratulations on getting to the center of the case.
[24:15.97]It'll be like 12 seconds long.
[24:18.59]I'll blow like a horn in the end or something.
[24:22.68]Yeah, that kid literally got completely screwed from Goddess.
[24:25.38]Yeah.
[24:28.94]Yeah, I'll send you like a private YouTube link or something.
[24:36.95]Alright, let's let him fight.
[24:40.69]What if he just didn't get up?
[24:49.12]Oh, we're both purple!
[24:49.84]Both from Twitch.db!
[24:51.10]Both from Twitch.db!
[24:53.92]Get him!
[25:00.26]That's right.
[25:00.74]28 damage.
[25:04.02]Do it again.
[25:04.96]Ooh, missed that one.
[25:06.08]You didn't flip that egg, did ya?
[25:13.48]But it was a fun idea.
[25:15.35]Especially considering I'm going to record an entire livestream off-stream.
[25:20.57]But I don't know what game I'm gonna play.
[25:23.69]I'm just gonna... I'm gonna have to sit here for like four or five hours and play something and just act as if it's a stream.
[25:29.99]And then pitch shift my voice down.
[25:38.89]Spoilers?
[25:39.37]Well, I mean, that's not a spoiler.
[25:40.57]That's just, that's part of the game show.
[25:44.35]Minecraft?
[25:44.98]No, no fucking way.
[25:46.22]Not a chance in hell.
[25:53.88]World of Warcraft.
[25:55.00]I mean, that's the only way it works, because I can't play a game.
[26:00.57]And no, I want it to be that I'm in chat participating in the stream.
[26:04.74]I have to immerse myself.
[26:05.88]I'm going to do like total immersion with this.
[26:09.76]I'm going to watch some streams.
[26:11.14]I'm going to study chat.
[26:13.24]I'm going to go and watch a bunch of other live streamers and just see like the trends.
[26:16.89]See what people are saying.
[26:17.73]See the new and improved like funny copy pastes.
[26:21.79]I'm going to take a look at those and I'm going to fucking do so much research you wouldn't even believe it.
[26:30.83]So many copy pastes and shit.
[26:32.17]They're going everywhere.
[26:35.58]Watch it happen.
[26:36.20]Yeah, that was like, that's the funniest thing to me.
[26:38.12]What if it happens instantly?
[26:42.67]Somebody, I say one word in chat and all this, and somebody was saying, what if so many people accuse each other and everybody gets banned that I'm like one of the only people left talking?
[26:50.55]Because I still have to follow the rules, right?
[26:57.67]I can't just not talk.
[26:58.77]I have to say something at least every two to three minutes.
[27:04.76]That was a lot of fucking money.
[27:10.32]New technique.
[27:12.08]Let's praise him.
[27:15.10]You know, I cannot accuse myself, because if I accuse somebody in chat and I get banned, that means I can't talk for 30 minutes, you understand?
[27:22.14]What's going on?
[27:26.16]Oh.
[27:26.28]I was gonna say, what's wrong with him?
[27:30.84]He's sick.
[27:32.68]How did he get sick?
[27:36.81]Yeah, I can't accuse somebody.
[27:41.29]He's out of the hospital.
[27:42.17]I'm so glad you're better.
[27:43.41]I think he just had, like, the flu.
[27:44.65]Why is his loyalty that far down?
[27:46.17]Come on, dude.
[27:47.83]Alright, we gotta, we gotta... No, he's gonna sleep.
[27:51.58]Unfortunately.
[27:52.14]Let's take a look at what the new technique is.
[27:55.54]30 minutes seems long.
[27:57.42]I mean, it kinda has to be.
[27:59.16]Unfortunately.
[27:59.74]It would have to be somewhere between...
[28:05.42]He still hates me.
[28:06.70]Alright, what do we get?
[28:08.48]Combination.
[28:09.08]25.
[28:10.42]This is a D%.
[28:13.40]This is an insanely powerful move.
[28:15.53]That is the hardest hitting move we've ever seen.
[28:20.39]B force, B sharpness.
[28:21.87]This is like a one hit kill move.
[28:26.47]But it has to be long enough where...
[28:29.88]people because the whole point is we're trying to get rid of as much of chat as possible through the whole stream where there's only potentially like a hundred people or even like 50 people still chatting after like three hours and I'm one of them there has to be a risk involved yeah it has to be there no one will get I'm telling you no one's gonna guess me I'm gonna be prepared
[29:01.51]We can just look at when the account was made.
[29:04.53]Yeah, I mean, you could.
[29:06.66]How do you know that I don't already have, like, at least five different alternative Twitch accounts?
[29:14.46]I have a couple of Twitch accounts that you guys have never fucking even heard of.
[29:18.52]It's so I can hide and go to somebody else's stream and not be Jerma985.
[29:23.52]You understand?
[29:24.06]You don't think I have, like, ten dummy accounts already?
[29:26.21]You don't even know!
[29:36.66]I'm prepared.
[29:37.34]No, it's not the Master of Comedy.
[29:44.84]Uh, let's go to bed.
[29:46.23]Go to bed.
[29:48.83]We'll do the next possible... Now we're just gonna farm money.
[30:01.34]He watches alternative accounts.
[30:04.21]He doesn't look very good these days.
[30:05.71]Maybe we should consider retiring him.
[30:07.27]Oh, come on.
[30:09.61]Hold on, he's gonna die?
[30:12.18]He's supposed to make... You have to make me some money first.
[30:15.40]Before we're gonna harvest your DNA.
[30:17.28]Alright, we got August 1st.
[30:20.48]Here we go.
[30:21.44]You know what?
[30:21.80]Fucking who cares?
[30:22.44]We're gonna make a new monster anyways.
[30:23.98]We're gonna use his DNA to make a new monster.
[30:26.22]We're gonna do this one, this one, all of them.
[30:28.80]Just until he's dead.
[30:31.33]So I'm gonna save after every tournament, and we're gonna do this until he dies.
[30:35.87]Every single tournament.
[30:37.41]And try to make like 10 grand.
[30:39.29]And then the day before he dies, we're gonna fuse him.
[30:48.08]Sounds like a plan.
[30:50.04]So we got this one is the next one coming up.
[30:51.80]We have two weeks.
[30:54.83]Let him sleep again, you know, if we're gonna just work him.
[30:57.81]Sleep.
[31:04.92]Let him die and we'll get new monsters.
[31:06.73]Really?
[31:07.07]Interesting.
[31:13.71]Local money launderer runs a streaming scheme, disguises as child, and hides behind barrel.
[31:19.21]All right, maybe you can do one more thing of training for me.
[31:27.77]You can do... No, you know, go to bed again.
[31:31.16]No, don't do that.
[31:31.88]That's bullshit.
[31:32.56]Just learn, just do power.
[31:40.70]So you're telling me if I let him die, we're gonna get new monster DNA.
[31:43.32]Is that what you're saying?
[31:48.51]Plus two power.
[31:49.43]Holy shit.
[31:51.01]What's that from?
[31:52.09]Holy shit.
[31:54.25]What's it from?
[31:54.79]That's, uh, Doom.
[31:55.73]No, what is it?
[31:56.65]Quake?
[31:58.63]Holy shit.
[32:00.59]Uh, he's gonna die anyways.
[32:03.65]Who cares?
[32:04.11]Eating potatoes.
[32:04.81]No, that's terrible.
[32:08.31]That's, like, really, really mean and awful.
[32:11.97]Ah, you're gonna die.
[32:12.71]Doesn't matter.
[32:13.23]Just eat some potatoes for like three weeks.
[32:16.31]Save you some money.
[32:17.05]Now he's stressed out.
[32:24.45]We have to take care of it.
[32:26.28]He's well.
[32:26.78]Alright.
[32:28.28]Go get some free, easy money.
[32:33.00]We're doing all these tournaments.
[32:34.32]We're gonna make five to ten grand until he's dead.
[32:42.63]No, no mints, no mints, he's gonna die.
[32:49.31]Ah shit, I didn't save.
[32:51.39]He's not gonna die right after this.
[32:56.22]Imagine if your last meal was plain boiled potatoes.
[33:10.62]That would be so bad.
[33:12.60]He might.
[33:13.20]No, he's not gonna die.
[33:14.44]He's gonna be fine.
[33:15.30]And then we're gonna suck out his DNA with a straw.
[33:21.46]Alright, let's try his new move.
[33:23.12]Let's see the last move he can have before he dies.
[33:24.92]Too bad he's dead, because wowie.
[33:32.25]I mean, you're talking about, I wish he was still alive.
[33:34.61]Can we give him some, like, prune juice and let him live?
[33:41.22]It's alright.
[33:41.80]We got him all this level up, so when he leveled up he could go to the tournaments and win us some money.
[33:45.50]And I don't know why I said it so, like, so strung together like that.
[33:48.81]Uh-oh, he's rabid.
[33:57.57]Didn't this guy kick my ass a long time ago?
[33:59.14]Yep, we have since gone off the deep end in regards to our statistical skills.
[34:09.27]Why is a dog gonna die?
[34:10.37]Alright, somebody has- one of you monster rancher... ...visionados.
[34:15.73]If we let him die, do we unlock new monsters?
[34:21.75]Or should I- you know, is that gonna happen?
[34:25.53]Because we still have Lorax that I'm willing to level up with tons of power.
[34:29.27]No.
[34:35.33]Yes, you do.
[34:36.61]No.
[34:37.35]No.
[34:37.75]One guy said yes.
[34:38.55]Two guys said yes.
[34:39.29]Three guys said yes.
[34:40.19]Four, five, eight guys said yes.
[34:44.41]Mostly no.
[34:45.21]Okay.
[34:47.03]Only if no one else died.
[34:48.77]Well, does that... Does that, like, stupid tongue monster count?
[34:56.14]Oh, boy.
[34:56.72]That's so good.
[34:57.72]He's so good.
[35:04.70]Ugh.
[35:06.26]Look it up, you nerd.
[35:07.62]Look it up yourself, nerd.
[35:12.51]Alright, fine.
[35:14.83]Let's see.
[35:17.05]Monster Rancher 2 Monster Death.
[35:20.33]Let's see what happens.
[35:25.60]One of the top things.
[35:26.90]Anyone else feel sort of sad when your monster dies?
[35:29.96]That's it.
[35:37.08]This is somebody being sad.
[35:48.64]You act like I haven't been looking at the wiki.
[35:58.23]Streamer kills local Garfield.
[36:00.15]I love how that's a local Garfield, as opposed to THE Garfield.
[36:14.30]Let's make him fight until he dies.
[36:17.10]That's not what I mean.
[36:18.26]I mean, it is what I mean, but... How is this any... Everyone's calling me like, oh, you're a fucking terrible part... How is this any different than Pokemon?
[36:26.50]You guys love that game.
[36:27.32]Pokemon sells hundreds of trillions of copies.
[36:30.30]You do the same shit.
[36:32.22]We already talked about this.
[36:33.87]How is this less humane than Pokemon?
[36:40.95]You're running out of steam there.
[36:43.85]Pokemon don't die.
[36:44.82]Yes, they do.
[36:47.42]You bring them to the lab and you put them in like the chicken incubator.
[36:50.56]And they reverse incubate and they die.
[36:54.20]You put them in like the warming tray at McDonald's and they die.
[36:57.80]Whatever the hell you do.
[37:03.43]Bring them to the dumbass doctor.
[37:05.75]What's his name?
[37:06.43]What's her nurse?
[37:07.27]What's her name?
[37:07.77]Nurse, um... Oh, they faint.
[37:11.31]Oh, they faint.
[37:13.14]Yeah, a.k.a.
[37:14.74]die for children.
[37:15.86]Hey, how do we say fucking die, but make sure like kids don't cry?
[37:25.09]Faint.
[37:36.91]Like in Fortnite, they're eliminated, not killed.
[37:40.70]Right?
[37:44.23]They faint and then go live on the farm.
[37:49.77]There's Pokemon graveyards.
[37:56.00]No, they're just sleepy.
[38:01.40]Get ready, this is everyone that's gonna get so sad when he's dead.
[38:14.62]You gotta beat Fimba in the tournament to unlock them all.
[38:18.15]That's a quick 3300.
[38:19.19]And what is a shiny Pokemon?
[38:24.97]That's one that... It's just a different color, right?
[38:33.92]Local streamer ruins the childhood of hundreds of trillions of people by saying that Pokemon die.
[38:48.27]How many total copies has Pokemon sold across every single video game on every platform?
[38:57.98]700 million?
[39:01.06]Is it a billion?
[39:01.85]Have they sold a billion copies of Pokemon over 20 years?
[39:09.09]How many like hundreds of millions?
[39:14.54]At least 7 million.
[39:16.06]300 million?
[39:16.88]1,000 million.
[39:17.68]Isn't that a billion?
[39:22.53]At least 500,000.
[39:23.07]Alright, again.
[39:29.99]Do it again.
[39:31.03]Remember, we don't necessarily care if he dies.
[39:33.37]I mean, we care if he dies, but I'm talking about in the grand scheme of things.
[39:38.02]For a third generation monster, it's saved.
[39:44.09]300 million Okay We care you don't all of a sudden you guys care What happened over the last two or three streams where everybody hated this thing?
[40:00.19]You guys talked about like get rid of it fucking throw it away that guy sucks bring back sonic And now all of a sudden that he's getting close to old age and everyone's like no, he's bringing back.
[40:10.65]I love this guy.
[40:11.79]I
[40:17.42]Ah, or a dog.
[40:18.82]He's my dog too!
[40:20.70]And I love him!
[40:22.98]And I respect him!
[40:31.77]This is gonna happen to me one day?
[40:33.39]I won by default.
[40:42.05]Splendid victory for me.
[40:43.99]I'm gonna hold the match to decide who win- I'm gonna win by default.
[40:50.31]This guy's awesome.
[40:51.17]This is the reason why we have any money right now.
[40:54.29]BB Sonic was cool.
[40:57.17]He gave up, yeah.
[40:57.99]We're just gonna, you know what, just... Alright, here's what we're gonna do, because every monster is afraid of him.
[41:03.20]In the D-Cups.
[41:04.90]I'm gonna just try to keep him alive as long as I can and bring him to only D-Cups and just, like, prop him up.
[41:09.66]Prop him up with, like, string.
[41:12.34]Even if he's, like, dying, like, bring him in.
[41:14.20]Just, like, wheel him in.
[41:15.10]Like, everyone's terrified of him anyways.
[41:16.78]He could be a fucking money-printing puppet for all I care.
[41:23.78]That was like terrible.
[41:26.19]He's fine.
[41:26.85]He's with us still.
[41:28.33]He's a good boy.
[41:38.65]Let's make Jerma stream until he dies of old age.
[41:50.05]This guy's this guy's awesome.
[41:51.85]I love this guy.
[41:52.53]This guy's way better than Sonic was in regards to skill Make it streamers of money printing machine then like we're gonna hold him up on like string and bring him out to events.
[42:09.31]Oh No, that's not good And just wait when we combine him I
[42:18.94]With another monster.
[42:20.92]He's gonna do so much awesome shit.
[42:23.29]He's gonna... It's gonna give so many great stats.
[42:27.23]I want shoes.
[42:27.99]He gets whatever he wants.
[42:29.81]Absolutely.
[42:32.23]Absolutely.
[42:32.73]You get whatever you want.
[42:33.51]You've done such a great job.
[42:35.11]We all love you so much.
[42:37.88]Okay, don't dare keep printing us your money.
[42:50.07]All right, again, let him rest.
[42:58.83]Give him the shoe he stole.
[43:00.65]I wish you could pet him.
[43:02.83]I guess that, like, playing does that too, right?
[43:07.03]Let's upgrade Jeremy so he can stream earlier.
[43:09.47]Yeah, but this is, this is a monster.
[43:19.30]Alright, this is like an otherworldly monster.
[43:26.30]This is what he lives for, he lives to fight.
[43:29.47]He's a triceratops monster.
[43:34.49]So are you.
[43:39.72]What, you don't think this is hard for me too?
[43:41.26]You don't think this is hard?
[43:43.30]You don't think this is hard for me?
[43:45.93]I'm gonna have to start with a new monster and level him up again.
[43:48.19]It's hard for me too!
[43:52.50]I love this good boy!
[43:53.52]You don't think I like this good boy?
[43:54.78]He's one of the best boys we've had!
[43:56.06]No, let's save it.
[44:10.09]No, what?
[44:11.05]Why?
[44:11.77]I don't want to kill him, he's fucking awesome!
[44:14.05]He's so talented!
[44:19.66]We've got it.
[44:20.06]We have another tournament here.
[44:22.87]I'm going to skip that one.
[44:23.61]We're going to go right for this one.
[44:26.15]Or maybe this one.
[44:27.75]Eight entrance, yeah.
[44:28.79]Well, no.
[44:29.95]We'll go with this one because everyone's going to run away.
[44:33.00]It's $1,000 for free.
[44:34.02]I don't want to do eight contestants.
[44:35.42]That's too long.
[44:36.02]He's too old.
[44:39.66]So we'll let him sleep for a little bit.
[44:41.74]One more rest.
[44:53.53]He's only talented when he's a money printer.
[44:55.70]After that, straight into the furnace.
[44:57.94]Oh my god.
[45:01.64]Alright, see, I'm not saying shit like that.
[45:03.60]Like, you guys are saying shit like that.
[45:05.48]I am not saying anything like that at all.
[45:10.05]Give me some fishies.
[45:14.61]That's, that's, I condone.
[45:17.97]I don't condone that kind of behavior, you understand?
[45:21.13]Absolutely not.
[45:28.48]He's spoiled.
[45:29.02]Well, it's okay.
[45:34.39]We are giving him meat.
[45:38.23]Uh, what do we got here?
[45:39.67]Save it right now.
[45:43.97]Do B rank?
[45:45.35]I don't want him to die if he goes into B rank.
[45:51.26]How do we know this is not one of your other accounts?
[45:58.55]A. Okay, we could do B. We'll try this one.
[46:02.71]This one's 3,000.
[46:03.03]We get a Man-Satan.
[46:03.89]Rest.
[46:04.05]He'd make... I didn't say he'd make good shoes.
[46:21.31]Now you guys are putting words in my mouth I made like one print money comment about like Bringing him out there when he's old and all the sudden like all the sudden I'm talking about talking about like furnaces That did not happen It's still stupid let's try it I'm confident
[46:53.41]I'm gonna attach strings to him and his corpse?
[46:55.98]When did I say corpse?
[46:57.84]I said when he was old to like let him to help him out to get out there because people are afraid of him.
[47:04.14]You know like I just roll him out there and monsters would be like oh I remember this guy he's scary and he wouldn't have to do anything.
[47:11.73]I was talking about like when he's old he's gonna be so skilled and no everyone's gonna be so afraid of him he's not gonna need to fight anybody that's what I that was the metaphor I was going for.
[47:21.55]Don't put W-O-R-D's in my M-O-U-T-H-S's.
[47:30.27]Weekend at Germa Monster Ranch.
[47:31.97]What do you mean that's worse?
[47:44.73]You know how well taken care of I would make sure he would be?
[47:49.02]I think he's fighting by himself.
[47:51.79]No, he's not.
[47:54.19]You guys understand how well taken care of this dog is going to be in his old age?
[47:58.01]He's going to eat meat every day.
[48:00.29]He's going to get so groomed and pampered.
[48:03.74]All he has to do is just get out there and just stand there.
[48:06.66]And people will run away.
[48:17.30]He's really good.
[48:27.10]You feed him fish, but he's still fine.
[48:29.48]Oh my god.
[48:35.09]Oh, you guys.
[48:46.14]He's owning.
[48:46.72]He's doing awesome.
[48:47.74]He's doing really good.
[48:56.12]Because we all know having strings to- I wasn't saying- No, I'm saying, like, metaphorically.
[49:02.76]Like, get him out there.
[49:05.81]To help him.
[49:06.43]I wouldn't want him to fall down.
[49:09.89]How do you- How do you feed a wall?
[49:23.44]Nobody can even touch it, it's amazing.
[49:30.47]Stay back here.
[49:31.43]No, I'll just stay.
[49:32.07]I can get her.
[49:34.35]Okay, I gotta be careful.
[49:45.78]See?
[49:53.02]Local streamer ties up wolf monster and force feeds its shoes.
[50:01.23]Oh my fucking god.

[50:12.30]Uh, yeah.
[50:12.90]Man, get him off me!
[50:27.15]Local streamer dyes wolf purple and throws it into a wall for money.
[50:35.41]See what I'm saying?
[50:36.01]Like, I'm not the one saying this shit.

[52:14.90]Okay, I have to just beat the wall again.
[52:16.38]Easy.

[52:34.96]Really?
[52:36.42]Do it again.
[52:42.27]Do it again!
[52:43.21]Nice job, Chura!
[52:47.67]Nice job, Chura!
[52:58.00]Alright, going for the... You're fine.
[53:01.72]Going for the kill shot here, Cura.
[53:04.94]Nice one, Cura!
[53:08.37]Tournament won.
[53:21.20]Guys are fucking crazy.
[53:23.84]Uh...
[53:27.22]See, he's still capable.
[53:28.42]I thought it was pronounced like courage.
[53:45.75]Yeah, but now it says that's Kyora.
[53:50.21]K-K-K-Y-O-R-A.
[53:54.41]Gained a little bit of fame.
[53:56.44]world famous he's been scooting like that since he was a young baby curing we might actually be able to get him to a rank
[54:19.34]I think Kyora learned something.
[54:21.56]Oh boy.
[54:22.86]You guys thought he was on the way out.
[54:24.95]Well, his life hasn't even started.
[54:32.75]I want to play with you next week.
[54:33.85]See, he's still fine.
[54:52.43]Oh, this is like... This is actually kind of sad.
[55:00.53]I just got really, really sad.
[55:04.02]He just wants to play before... I'm actually touched by this.
[55:08.90]This is incredibly touching.
[55:14.44]This is actually hitting me pretty hard here.
[55:21.87]One last playtime.
[55:23.07]He wanted to just play one more time.
[55:28.77]See, and everybody like from the start thought he was an idiot.
[55:32.30]They didn't like him.
[55:33.04]None of you guys liked him in the beginning and now he's a fan favorite.
[55:37.10]And we're gonna let him win.
[55:41.89]I want him to have one last victory.
[55:50.79]Okay, I hit him.
[55:52.11]Alright, I'm not gonna throw another one at him.
[55:53.87]That looked like that really caused a lot of problems.
[56:00.53]I'm just gonna miss.
[56:04.37]This is gonna be so sad.
[56:05.55]He's got a hell of a throwing arm.
[56:17.30]Does he want to come play catch one more time?
[56:22.56]See?
[56:22.70]You need one.
[56:24.72]Good job.
[56:25.24]You did it.
[56:30.12]You did it.
[56:30.52]You really did it.
[56:32.46]Good job.
[56:44.87]Hey, the official tournament is happening this week.
[56:46.53]Seems to be good to go.
[56:47.35]What do you think?
[56:50.87]One more?
[56:52.98]One more battle.
[56:54.04]One more battle just to say, like, fuck you to all these idiots in this tournament.
[56:59.17]Get the old boy out there one more time.
[57:02.25]Get him to A rank one more time.
[57:05.55]What do you say?
[57:09.21]Save the game and get him out there and show all these young little shits what he can do.
[57:23.34]Save it one more time.
[57:26.10]Battle official tournament.
[57:31.55]Yes, let's go.
[57:34.07]Do your best.
[57:34.63]Let's try to win this.
[57:42.90]I never did this for BB because we needed BB's DNA.
[57:51.72]Yeah, watch this.
[57:55.92]Big tournament.
[57:56.82]This will get to A ranking.
[58:02.24]These are all... I remember these guys.
[58:03.86]Remember Aspen?
[58:06.16]I'm ready.
[58:09.00]I'm sitting in the back stands right now.
[58:10.80]I'm like this.
[58:12.02]Like this.
[58:12.38]I'm the concerned parent going like this.
[58:19.28]Like at the Olympics, the mom that's up there.
[58:23.89]That's me right now.
[58:27.00]Now let's kick some ass.
[58:30.32]One last hurrah.
[58:35.74]Went for a big move there.
[58:36.68]It's alright, you can handle it.
[58:41.37]Dodge it.
[58:42.43]It's alright, it's only 13 damage, not a big deal.
[58:44.57]Bingo.
[58:46.63]How's that?
[58:47.77]How's that for a fucking champion move, huh?
[58:49.83]How's that?
[58:50.21]How does it feel like to get touched by a champion?
[58:55.39]Let him do it himself?
[58:56.69]I will.
[58:58.72]Dad's gonna let him take the reins here.
[59:09.00]I'm going for like the big play.
[59:13.76]Dodged it again.
[59:14.72]Uh-oh.
[59:16.60]We gotta get a big move here.
[59:17.56]Big one.
[59:17.86]We have to go for it.
[59:26.50]Come on, get it!
[59:29.12]Big champion play!
[59:29.96]Alright, I'm gonna let him do what he wants.
[59:51.24]We're gonna let him just play.
[59:55.35]And I'm gonna just pace around the room while he does it.
[59:58.31]Okay?
[59:58.93]I'm gonna be the concerned parent.
[60:00.19]Here we go.
[60:11.70]I'm wearing, like, a really fucking weird outfit today.
[60:16.62]Do we want to give him instructions?
[60:17.82]No.
[60:18.32]I want to let him do it.
[60:21.73]I want him to do it.
[60:25.57]Let's get me in the stand.
[60:27.17]Okay.
[60:30.57]Is that good?
[60:52.98]I need to have like a... Okay.
[60:54.68]Here we go.
[61:02.44]Just like on TV watching.
[62:08.73]He did it!
[62:17.38]He lost!
[62:39.55]Oh, god damn it.
[62:40.65]By, like, what?
[62:41.45]Not even a percent?
[62:48.57]Oh, no.
[62:48.97]That mother's gonna be real upset.
[62:50.59]Oh, no.
[62:58.44]That's not good.
[63:04.98]God damn it.
[63:05.52]Oh, well.
[63:07.74]I'm gonna let him do it again.
[63:11.13]Let him do it on his own.
[63:12.97]Try to at least win us some money.
[63:14.87]He did his best.
[63:15.73]He is like such a good boy.
[63:17.05]We all like love them, right?
[63:18.31]We all love this guy.
[63:20.95]You abandoned him?
[63:21.82]No, I'm in the stands cheering him on.
[63:23.28]I'm very concerned.
[63:24.88]When he got hurt, my baby got hurt!
[63:26.42]Okay, this is a next level version of mine.
[63:43.69]Somebody's clip title.
[63:47.31]Aquaman loses his entire life savings on an animal fight.
[63:53.68]Oh, that's just, that just is so out-fucking-rageous.
[63:57.74]There's no reason for that to make any sense.
[64:01.20]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[64:02.53]Come on, you can do it.
[64:04.25]We have faith in you.
[64:10.75]Hit him!
[64:11.53]Get him with a big percentage!
[64:13.03]Right here!
[64:13.95]Oh, that would have been it too.
[64:15.85]He had the same idea as me.
[64:19.29]Shit, come on, one big hit!
[64:21.05]Don't get knocked out!
[64:22.19]Now he's got extra power!
[64:30.24]He did it!
[64:32.54]Yes!
[64:37.90]Fight my own fights?
[64:38.90]No!
[64:40.12]It's his time to shine.
[64:43.54]He still has an opportunity.
[64:54.47]He's still got it.
[64:58.73]Who's the big bad wolf of this tournament, I wonder?
[65:02.93]It's definitely Robiniel.
[65:08.05]Sounds like an over-the-counter drug.
[65:10.13]Sounds like a cough medicine.
[65:12.13]Robinale is doing a good job.
[65:14.71]Ghoulshine sucks absolute ass.
[65:16.53]That looks like a victory we'll get.
[65:17.69]Okay, now it's... Okay, Duelist is here.
[65:27.44]Uh... I have faith he'll do it.
[65:36.44]I wonder if I can, like, overlay this.
[65:41.33]I wish I had a green screen sometimes.
[65:49.03]No, I'm trying to get like a reacting crowd video to play in the background.
[65:55.60]I'm probably gonna have to pay for this.
[65:59.12]I don't have any, I got another.
[66:03.30]That's not good right off the bat.
[66:09.81]There we go.
[66:10.21]That was a big hit, baby.
[66:13.42]Get him with the super punches.
[66:15.66]Come on, get him with the plock.
[66:17.68]Get him with the plock.
[66:19.40]P-L-O-K.
[66:20.68]There it is.
[66:22.10]Bingo.
[66:28.91]He just got sneezed on.
[66:29.73]It's alright.
[66:32.19]Big hit, baby.
[66:32.77]Come on.
[66:34.24]Bite him.
[66:36.55]Come on, do the funny comedy dog thing where you bite the guy's groin in every comedy movie where a dog is in the fucking movie.
[66:44.81]Do the groin bite.
[66:47.15]He did it.
[66:47.59]He listened.
[66:48.51]Good boy.
[66:48.81]Do it again.
[67:02.10]He wins.
[67:03.60]I think he has a chance to do this.
[67:05.44]I really do.
[67:17.64]Disgruntled mother.
[67:25.69]Why is that thing just the naked man from DaVinci?
[67:28.09]What's that thing called?
[67:28.91]You guys don't know what I'm talking about.
[67:36.32]What's it?
[67:36.66]Naked man on a wheel?
[67:37.80]What's that thing called?
[67:49.32]The Vertruvian Man.
[67:56.83]The Mona Lisa.
[67:57.41]Alright, here we go.
[68:00.43]This is gonna be a tough one.
[68:02.37]I think he can pull it out.
[68:08.22]The Dark Souls Skeleton Wheel.
[68:10.44]Alright, Sanjuras.
[68:11.96]Remember, he instantly killed us last time, but not this time, because we've got heart.
[68:16.33]H. E. A. R. T. Still got it.
[68:22.98]Ooh, he can't take that!
[68:26.92]He can't handle the, actually, the up-close stuff.
[68:29.00]Good idea!
[68:35.72]He's getting confused.
[68:37.71]Dude, just get a fucking big hit or two and you'll have it.
[68:40.60]Do it.
[68:41.34]What are you doing?
[68:42.82]Flick the switch.
[68:44.20]Flick the switch to the big one.
[68:45.90]Flick the switch.
[68:47.16]Oh, he is not doing this right.
[68:49.08]Flick.
[68:53.60]God, he missed.
[68:54.06]It's okay.
[68:57.90]Oh, come on.
[68:58.52]You can do it.
[68:59.10]One more big hit.
[68:59.84]String it together.
[69:00.62]Go.
[69:01.56]Do something.
[69:02.68]Do anything.
[69:03.84]Do something.
[69:06.14]One more hit.
[69:07.00]Hit him.
[69:07.62]With anything.
[69:09.10]Do it!
[69:10.18]Do something!
[69:10.86]That's it!
[69:14.10]Do!
[69:17.78]No!
[69:31.10]He's spoiled and dependent, so he doesn't fight well on his own.
[69:35.06]Shit.
[69:38.62]Why am I not controlling him?
[69:39.88]Because we're doing the thing where it's his last fight ever, so he gets to make his own decisions, but I guess I'll take over.
[69:57.43]What a curtain drop.
[70:01.83]I lost already.
[70:03.11]It's alright though, because we can at least get to second or third place and win some of them.
[70:10.79]I'll take the reigns on this one.
[70:12.39]Because guess what?
[70:13.27]You might not win the tournament, but the guy that's 5-0, you can embarrass that person, right?
[70:23.00]I will embarrass this guy.
[70:24.14]I'm gonna, like, two or three-hit kill this guy.
[70:26.48]Hope he's ready to be embarrassed.
[70:50.16]How's that for you?
[70:51.56]How does that feel?
[70:57.71]Back it up.
[70:58.97]Dodge it.
[70:59.83]See?
[71:00.55]Good.
[71:01.59]Hit him again with the big one.
[71:02.85]The big one.
[71:03.43]Not this one.
[71:03.91]The big one.
[71:05.16]Dodge it again.
[71:06.16]Nice.
[71:06.80]Big one.
[71:09.18]It's okay.
[71:10.14]It's alright.
[71:10.64]He dodged it.
[71:11.10]He's fine.
[71:12.54]Ayyyy.
[71:18.35]It's all right.
[71:19.13]It's okay.
[71:20.47]Bingo.
[71:21.98]Oh, I'm sorry.
[71:23.20]Were you 5-0?
[71:25.64]Oh, I'm sorry.
[71:26.22]Are you currently getting fucking embarrassed?
[71:28.24]Did you just get embarrassed in front of at least how many people are here?
[71:32.66]You just got fucking embarrassed.
[71:36.78]There's 2,500 people here.
[71:39.57]Hope you quit your professional esports career as a fucking dusty worm or whatever you are.
[71:49.04]You can't win the tournament, but you can embarrass somebody.
[71:57.71]Lose.
[72:01.09]Let's see.
[72:01.41]Is there any way to win?
[72:12.99]Toxic streamer.
[72:20.82]It's the worm shadow.
[72:23.90]I can get second place.
[72:24.66]I'm alright with that.
[72:28.77]Alright, we're gonna win this one too.
[72:31.11]This is the last fight.
[72:32.63]Let's... I'm gonna take control.
[72:35.01]I was gonna be like, let's let him.
[72:37.37]No, it's my control now.
[72:45.01]His defense is awful.
[72:47.43]Why is this thing so good?
[72:50.18]Watch this.
[72:50.80]This is the other top seed.
[72:52.94]He's gonna be embarrassed.
[72:59.76]Bonus to God!
[73:03.69]We just want... Two-hit kill.
[73:06.19]Go home.
[73:07.13]Go the fuck home.
[73:08.15]And, like, if I... If he had actually swung one more time, we win the tournament.
[73:13.03]Against the caped sunglass man.
[73:17.00]That we would have won the tournament.
[73:18.89]It's alright.
[73:19.63]You can't win them all.
[73:21.27]Should have just controlled them the whole time.
[73:27.64]Alright, so we got four and... I got four and three.
[73:31.48]He's five... Yeah, it's not possible.
[73:33.58]Second place.
[73:34.70]Or third place.
[73:45.14]We had this one won.
[73:46.24]That was a victory.
[73:53.28]Yeah.
[73:53.90]Too bad.
[74:01.13]It's alright.
[74:01.45]We still get a good... It was a good showing.
[74:08.77]So I made $1,600.
[74:09.67]And how famous did I get?
[74:13.85]That's not bad.
[74:16.30]Save scum?
[74:16.84]No, we can't save scum.
[74:18.96]Can't save scum.
[74:28.46]He did us proud.
[74:29.35]He was a very good boy.
[74:32.67]He tried his hardest.
[74:38.35]Now the question is, what are we going to do with him now?
[74:43.02]Good work.
[74:51.29]I mean... Alright, take out, like, fake video game emotions here.
[75:10.01]Giving him meat is actually a bad place to spend this money.
[75:16.35]I don't wanna sca... Why don't we... We're just gonna go fuse him.
[75:20.03]Why would I give him... It's 10 bucks.
[75:22.15]You know, I... That's $300.
[75:28.09]Give him meat... But... But really though, that's expensive.
[75:31.79]We're about to fuse him.
[75:34.82]Give him the meat.
[75:35.72]Give him meat or unsub.
[75:37.04]I'm not being... I'm just... It's 300 bucks and we're just gonna fuse him.
[75:44.88]It's his last meal.
[75:49.41]Okay.
[75:52.41]Okay.
[75:57.41]Don't give him the meat, you're crazy.
[75:59.55]But chat would never let me get away with this.
[76:04.33]I would never get away with this.
[76:15.14]You understand that for the next three hours of this stream, people would talk about how I didn't give him meat as his last meal.
[76:21.69]And I would be a terrible human being, right?
[76:24.25]Wasted fucking money.
[76:25.57]Just threw money in the garbage can.
[76:27.47]It's alright.
[76:29.11]So what do we got here?
[76:29.89]We have... Let's go back to town for a minute.
[76:34.59]What do I have for items?
[76:37.65]Okay, I do have disc chips.
[76:40.29]Got some oil.
[76:41.01]We got shoes.
[76:49.29]Yeah, if we're down 300 gold in an hour, I don't want to hear a word from anybody here.
[76:57.93]So here's what we're gonna do.
[77:00.23]I want to see... I want to go to town.
[77:04.53]I want to freeze him.
[77:05.25]I want to see what the combination between him and the Lorax would be.
[77:09.33]Because if I train up the Lorax, and then I combine these two, we could get a creature that is unspeakably talented.
[77:19.35]But what do we get for doing that?
[77:24.53]You know what I'm saying?
[77:28.32]Or should I put another couple CDs in?
[77:32.78]Has 10k, doesn't want to spend 300.
[77:34.70]Money is not easy to come by.
[77:37.07]Unless you tire your monster out doing tournaments.
[77:42.39]Let's get him in the freezer.
[77:49.40]music yeah come here boys and girls we're gonna have a party sit down and watch me play with monsters what are we gonna do you need to win tournaments to get monsters don't worry we're gonna start winning tournaments now
[78:12.71]Just watch.
[78:13.13]We're gonna try Dino.
[78:15.65]Have we put Dino Crisis in?
[78:17.17]Or Celine Dion in?
[78:19.13]What have we not put?
[78:19.97]Hold on.
[78:20.25]I've got a bag of tricks over here.
[78:25.79]What else do I got here?
[78:34.46]How about this?
[78:39.86]Delete.
[78:40.18]Why would I delete him?
[78:43.39]Didn't I hit my monster last stream?
[78:45.53]I absolutely would never even consider such a thing, so no.
[78:50.68]Absolutely no.
[78:51.34]We're going to put in the original movies.
[78:55.30]See what we get from it.
[78:58.42]We got a couple of discs here.
[79:01.08]Just to see if we get something interesting.
[79:02.48]Because nobody likes the Lorax.
[79:05.39]Nobody liked Kiora either.
[79:08.63]But, you know, we all see how much everybody feels about it now.
[79:13.43]I have a feeling that if Lorax wins a couple of tournaments, everyone will fucking love the guy.
[79:19.49]You guys will end up making, like, Lorax body pillows in, like, two or three days.
[79:24.76]If he wins, like, a tournament.
[79:29.16]You'll buy, like, your next, like, Tupperware set will be Lorax themed.
[79:35.73]If the guy wins, like, a sea tournament.
[79:37.49]Come on, now.
[79:45.51]have one.
[79:47.59]A mug.
[79:48.03]Yeah, you guys buy mugs.
[79:51.47]What about a t-shirt that says, like, I'm the Lorax?
[80:00.68]I regret to tell you that this rare monster can only be... Oh, don't drop it.
[80:06.46]Okay, put Selene Dion in here.
[80:08.28]There's no way Selene Dion is, like, a rare monster.
[80:12.63]No way.
[80:13.81]I refuse to believe that.
[80:19.73]Did we already do this, though, in Monster Hunter 2?
[80:21.39]I forget.
[80:23.29]Maybe not.
[80:23.69]We'll find out.
[80:30.95]Oh, I forgot to prove it to you.
[80:37.61]Reaction cam?
[80:38.97]Oh, that's right.
[80:39.47]Sorry.
[80:39.71]I forgot.
[80:41.17]I'll put the reaction cam on.
[80:47.82]Whoops.
[80:48.86]Okay.
[80:52.05]here comes the reaction.
[81:01.47]Incoming joke.
[81:02.15]I made an incoming joke.
[81:07.41]There's a big moment.
[81:08.13]Let's fucking move this.
[81:14.02]Okay.
[81:15.98]Here we go.
[81:23.91]There's a reaction.
[81:28.27]Snow!
[81:28.57]I see snow!
[81:29.09]I see snow!
[81:30.65]Ice themed.
[81:42.61]He's back.
[81:52.58]Why?
[81:53.94]Honestly, though.
[81:54.56]The fuck, I... It's gonna be Beanbag Sonic Jr.
[82:08.07]No, it's gonna be BB Sonic Jr.
[82:11.61]BB Sonic Jr.
[82:24.22]No, I don't want to play again with Beanbag Sonic.
[82:27.62]We already played for like 12 hours with this guy.
[82:36.22]I'm not doing the same monster.
[82:40.76]We'll keep him.
[82:51.79]But BB Sonic Jr.
[82:53.41]is not... He's... Put him in the freezer.
[82:57.23]No.
[82:57.61]We're not doing this.
[83:01.64]Let's freeze him.
[83:02.32]I want to see what the combination is.
[83:05.62]Yeah, see?
[83:06.00]He's alive.
[83:08.12]And he turns into like a germa planet when you freeze him.
[83:10.28]So it's all good.
[83:15.43]Let's see what happens.
[83:19.85]If we were to do Kyora, I'm just curious.
[83:22.66]I'm just CURIOUS, you know what I mean?
[83:26.30]Kyora and BB Sonic Jr.
[83:30.38]With some disc chips.
[83:33.62]Just out of curiosity, let's see what it does.
[83:43.09]None of that's any good.
[83:49.79]And what about if we did the Lorax and Cure?
[83:51.71]We've got to find a decent combination.
[83:53.11]Because if you do a shitty combination, I don't want to play with some crappy monster.
[83:58.74]No, no.
[84:04.00]Not Flower.
[84:04.46]Just Chips.
[84:06.38]Okay.
[84:09.60]This combination doesn't look so good.
[84:11.10]I can't recommend it.
[84:14.18]So this is not even something I would want to do anyways.
[84:19.32]Cura and Tim Allen.
[84:22.52]Somebody else has to get leveled up a little bit here.
[84:27.40]Okay, this can be used.
[84:33.47]This one's all up to you.
[84:36.91]So, I mean, there's a possibility to get the Dayton, Mint, Rockhound, Ripper.
[84:45.58]I mean, I already have a Kabalos.
[84:47.52]That's what he was.
[84:53.51]I don't know what Dayton is.
[84:59.06]Could get mint.
[85:01.46]Could get a nice Dayton.
[85:02.50]I don't know what that means.
[85:07.39]We're not gonna do it yet.
[85:09.63]So we're the leveling up Tim Allen.
[85:12.65]Or, I mean, who... Who can I delete here?
[85:18.90]What happens if I do it with the wall?
[85:20.06]Oh, I think I'm gonna delete the rind.
[85:24.74]Let's just see what happens, because if this is not worth doing... It doesn't look good.
[85:33.66]So why does this not look good?
[85:35.02]Crimson-Eyed, Terror Dog, like why are these so bad?
[85:37.72]This looks kinda cool.
[85:41.18]Like what is Crimson-Eyed?
[85:42.68]That seems interesting.
[85:46.83]Cure in D-Sponge, let's see what it does.
[85:49.93]Terror Dog like this, isn't that kinda cool?
[86:02.56]We've already played an entire game with D-Sponge.
[86:07.05]This combination doesn't look good.
[86:08.23]This pterodog and crimson eye, that does sound kind of, does sound good.
[86:13.39]I don't know.
[86:25.65]Good combinations come when both monsters are trained in the same stats.
[86:30.89]Let me see here.
[86:35.62]I want to go to... Let's go to the lab.
[86:39.48]Let me try one more CD, see if we can get anything else.
[86:41.66]I don't think we've done Dino Crisis yet in this one, have we?
[86:44.60]I'm fairly certain we haven't.
[86:46.85]Let me try it.
[86:48.39]Did we?
[86:48.95]It's put so many CDs in at this point.
[86:54.84]The disc chips guarantee the top choices?
[86:56.85]Okay, that's good to know.
[87:00.01]I have already done it, okay.
[87:02.59]What the fuck have I not done?
[87:05.45]No, I didn't- I did Celine Dion.
[87:07.79]Hold on, let me grab another CD.
[87:08.45]It is Zoo Tycoon.
[87:16.23]Zoo Tycoon 2, to be exact.
[87:21.26]I'm slowly turning into him.
[87:22.81]There's nothing even in here.
[87:24.21]Zoo Tycoon's not even in the box for Zoo Tycoon.
[87:31.44]Uh, why not?
[87:35.34]How about like the Die Hard trilogy from PlayStation 1?
[87:38.22]I don't think we did that here yet.
[87:41.01]Maybe we did.
[87:52.35]700,000 games?
[87:52.85]Oh, that is gone.
[87:53.73]I don't even know what the hell that is.
[88:00.22]Thank you.
[88:01.18]It's so funny.
[88:01.82]People keep talking about how this music is driving them fucking crazy.
[88:05.60]Every stream, somebody says it.
[88:08.42]No proof!
[88:18.89]There, you wanna see?
[88:19.97]There, there it is.
[88:21.33]There, look at, uh, see?
[88:24.33]See?
[88:24.71]Look, there.
[88:26.27]See?
[88:27.25]Just die hard.
[88:27.94]See?
[88:32.00]Fuck.
[88:35.68]Okay.
[88:41.00]Calm down, Aquaman.
[88:44.09]Big moment.
[88:44.75]Big fucking reaction incoming.
[88:58.14]Just like I'm going to do just like a YouTube video.
[88:59.44]Are you ready?
[89:01.34]What's it going to be, guys?
[89:04.86]Uh... This might be a decent combination, though.
[89:16.91]What happens if he gets combined?
[89:17.95]I need to give it a name.
[89:27.96]How about we're gonna do hue hue center human center human center gotta be human human center human center human centipede human centpede there
[90:01.28]There.
[90:02.06]Human Scentpain.
[90:11.42]So, let's just see what the combination is of this... Wait, I have to delete somebody.
[90:15.28]We're deleting Rind.
[90:17.14]Yeah.
[90:18.14]Delete.
[90:19.74]Delete the Rind.
[90:21.48]Not gonna use it.
[90:22.58]Not gonna... It's not really actually the Rind.
[90:24.66]It's the fake sweet Rind.
[90:25.92]Not real.
[90:27.82]Sorry.
[90:29.78]You were a halfy little replacement and you didn't, you're not even real.
[90:34.18]Everyone's saying no.
[90:35.26]I'm sorry guys, this is not the real Rind.
[90:37.61]This is a fake one.
[90:39.17]This is not the one with the watermelon on top.
[90:42.05]You're just, you're just attaching to this one because it has the same name.
[90:44.93]It's not even close to the same guy.
[90:50.09]Delete!
[90:51.61]Let's see what we get from these two.
[90:58.46]You know how easy it is to get a green wall?
[90:59.96]I can just get a dinosaur and a wall and put it together and I'll get sweet rind again.
[91:04.50]Why am I calling him sweet rind?
[91:05.50]It wasn't even real sweet rind.
[91:06.44]It was a fake sweet rind.
[91:07.33]It was just a rind.
[91:07.95]It was just a fucking computer program that made it look like that.
[91:13.01]Here we go.
[91:13.33]Cura.
[91:15.43]And... Human centipede.
[91:21.15]With some seasoning.
[91:23.00]I do have other stuff, though.
[91:24.14]Star prune.
[91:25.20]Oh, boy.
[91:25.94]Disc chips.
[91:28.00]Life and skill will increase, however speed will decrease.
[91:32.76]Interesting.
[91:33.22]I can just feed that to somebody?
[91:36.26]Let's see what we get.
[91:39.54]The prospect here is unsure.
[91:45.19]It's... No.
[91:47.65]No, don't proceed.
[91:55.77]This is terrible.
[92:03.87]Damn it, we have to get somebody to we're just gonna have to We've seen these all already I know We gotta unlock the other shit.
[92:13.96]We just have to play we got to get somebody to rank up.
[92:16.76]So I got a lot of money No CD fragments
[92:26.06]I'm gonna keep playing with Cura for another couple of tournaments.
[92:28.58]Try to get like 15 grand, 20 grand.
[92:34.64]Should we try to get like Terror Dog or something?
[92:38.22]Alright, let me ask the chat this.
[92:41.06]If I... I should level up Tim Allen and then get one of the scary people.
[92:50.07]Go for these two combinations and try to get Terror Dog.
[92:58.22]Alright, that's what we're gonna do.
[92:59.00]We're gonna train Tim Allen.
[93:02.13]Let's bring out Tim Allen.
[93:04.93]And turn off this fucking ugly ass webcam.
[93:15.87]That looks like shit.
[93:16.81]Alright, that's what we're gonna do.
[93:19.26]We're gonna improve Tim Allen.
[93:21.68]What's Tim Allen's stats?
[93:24.22]A little bit more to be desired, but that's okay.
[93:33.49]Don't you unlock new monster if Kuro dies.
[93:36.30]That's what people were saying.
[93:37.16]I don't remember that's what Tim Allen looked like.
[93:55.87]Why is Tim Allen a fucking mosquito?
[94:03.68]Oh, that's fucking funny.
[94:09.97]That was funny.
[94:15.02]That's doing it for me.
[94:16.00]That's doing it for me!
[94:17.90]Alright, battle?
[94:18.82]Select your player.
[94:25.71]We're gonna do this one for the disc chips.
[94:28.27]First we're gonna train a little bit.
[94:29.91]No, we're not.
[94:30.33]Let's train... Okay, let's go to... Not yet.
[94:35.25]Next week.
[94:36.37]This one.
[94:37.47]Okay.
[94:38.11]This one.
[94:38.60]Yeah.
[94:40.42]Sounds good.
[94:44.32]We're gonna stay on D... ...forever.
[94:52.49]So what are we training here?
[94:54.09]So, so, listen.
[94:56.40]Should I be training a bunch of skill and power because that's what we want to combine with Cura, right?
[95:08.86]Should I be focusing on power and skill?
[95:12.25]I know, it's a yes or no question, guys.
[95:18.19]Yes, yes, yes.
[95:21.57]Yes.
[95:22.91]Now you're thinking with portals.
[95:28.05]Yes.
[95:31.02]Alright.
[95:31.84]I'm alright with that.
[95:39.02]Now you're thinking with portals!
[95:40.00]So let's go train.
[95:44.79]I'm spending a dollar on this person.
[95:47.27]Until it's confirmed.
[95:50.41]So, power, life, speed down.
[95:53.91]I don't give two shits.
[96:00.77]The cake is a lie.
[96:03.90]Ehe.
[96:04.34]The cake is a lie.
[96:05.14]Ehe.
[96:06.62]Tim Allen did not finish this drill.
[96:08.24]Scolded.
[96:09.80]Should have done better.
[96:10.50]Now, can I get a couple of ehes in the chat, please?
[96:19.72]Can I get a fucking couple of E's?
[96:24.70]Let's do the same thing.
[96:26.56]It's two E's.
[96:34.71]Two lowercase E's dash H-E-E.
[96:38.43]You can't, come on.
[96:42.21]It's gold.
[96:42.73]The Q's.
[96:49.95]And now you're tired.
[96:50.57]Well, you didn't even get... And now I'm strict.
[96:52.15]Alright, go to bed, Tim the Mosquito Alan.
[97:01.92]Fucking mosquito.
[97:04.14]When somebody said the fucking mosquito, I got a couple of E's in the chat, like... Do it again.
[97:11.90]Drill.
[97:14.37]Power and life.
[97:15.57]I know you can do it.
[97:23.69]Are you not gonna be able to complete one piece of training?
[97:36.53]Which f- I didn't even look.
[97:38.13]What does she want?
[97:40.28]Jelly?
[97:40.66]Meat?
[97:42.90]Fish?
[97:43.34]Milk?
[97:43.70]Potato?
[97:44.00]I don't know what she likes, I didn't look.
[97:47.50]Usually fish is pretty safe.
[97:52.14]Isn't this an int monster?
[97:53.06]Yeah, but I was told... I was chilled to level up the same skills that the other person had that we're going to combine with to get the maximum amount of potential.
[98:10.00]Milk.
[98:10.40]I don't think it's milk.
[98:12.28]Is it milk?
[98:14.89]Oh, she does.
[98:15.89]She's a baby.
[98:16.51]She is going to drink milk.
[98:22.50]I did get the reward from the jellies.
[98:25.88]It was a... It was a doll made out of shit.
[98:29.10]I think we're going to get a... If we got a half off here, then we're going there.
[98:38.59]Half off.
[98:40.63]Oh.
[98:47.47]That was pretty good Jim Carrey in Living Color.
[98:51.96]Come on.
[98:58.02]You didn't sell the doll?
[99:03.92]No.
[99:07.34]Wait, what?
[99:07.68]Hold on.
[99:08.26]I'm looking up the doll.
[99:15.65]Yeah, fire marshal.
[99:19.03]Uh, okay.
[99:21.83]Are you tired or whatever?
[99:24.41]Training.
[99:24.89]Errantry.
[99:32.54]Have you seen... Oh, have you?
[99:35.14]Have you?
[99:37.56]Let's do power and life.
[99:42.40]It seems that there is a chance to acquire a new technique.
[99:46.06]For only $1,000.
[99:46.56]Power.
[99:47.06]Give him a little one-two, you know?
[100:01.26]We have never seen Tim Allen do this, so might as well watch some of it.
[100:07.85]Tim Allen can fly, so that's a good thing.
[100:09.81]Skip it.
[100:10.61]Success.
[100:12.35]Three and one.
[100:16.49]Let's see how Tim Allen deals with a sleeping camel.
[100:21.23]They always do that.
[100:21.83]They all do it.
[100:22.25]Don't worry.
[100:25.91]Success.
[100:27.61]Two and one.
[100:28.53]Where is the... Come on!
[100:31.96]This is not worth it.
[100:34.62]Learn that new technique at least.
[100:38.75]Fail!
[100:40.93]Try it again.
[100:50.93]Well, that was a complete waste of a thousand dollars.
[101:02.80]Babels can't learn over three skill points.
[101:05.88]Well.
[101:09.36]Drink some more milk, you baby.
[101:14.81]Tim's not very good at this.
[101:19.33]Time to harvest.
[101:21.31]No, not yet.
[101:21.99]It needs to have at least two to three hundred.
[101:26.24]Official tournament.
[101:27.24]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[101:30.84]Another half off training?
[101:33.46]Or is this the, uh, is this the mall?
[101:36.51]Two for one at the mall?
[101:38.81]What?
[101:42.09]Serious?
[101:46.27]Tim Allen's gonna pass out.
[101:49.60]Let's go buy some mint leaves.
[101:55.12]That they're cheap.
[101:57.04]Yes, I will give you anything you want at a discounted price.
[102:01.31]Watch this.
[102:01.61]What are you going to do?
[102:02.37]Like, what am I going to do about it?
[102:03.63]I'm going to buy.
[102:05.85]Let's get mint leaf.
[102:07.27]Let's get three of them.
[102:08.94]We get cash.
[102:10.34]Get 90 fucking $100.
[102:13.66]That's a big bank account.
[102:16.14]Maybe a piece of candy.
[102:17.52]No.
[102:18.30]Yeah.
[102:20.20]Should we fatten up Tim Allen?
[102:25.85]Jim is wasting all his money on training and errantry.
[102:27.95]What a dumb streamer.
[102:32.09]I was hoping I was going to get a new technique.
[102:34.87]Save the game.
[102:37.45]Yep.
[102:39.23]I have to spend money.
[102:42.65]What am I going to do?
[102:44.61]I have to spend the money.
[102:51.27]I'm not gonna spend it all.
[102:52.63]My cutoff is 8,000.
[102:53.45]Not spending any more money than 8,000.
[102:56.08]Plus, she's gonna get in a tournament, and she's gonna win, and that replaces the entire copper.
[103:01.20]You know what I'm saying?
[103:04.13]Look, I'm smarter than 6.1% of every person on Earth.
[103:05.73]You still tired?
[103:10.87]Come to bed, you big baby.
[103:20.92]There are 8 billion people on the planet.
[103:24.12]I'm smarter than like 10 million people, you understand?
[103:27.34]That's a whole lot of people.
[103:35.91]Tim Allen is an int-focused monster.
[103:39.25]Yeah, but we're not going to win any tournaments if she can't hurt anything.
[103:45.61]At this point, power is the only moves I have.
[103:47.77]I can't kill anything.
[103:48.69]I'll lose every tournament.
[103:51.16]So you watch- I love Rick and Morty!
[103:52.90]Yeah, I watch Rick and Morty.
[103:56.45]That's like my favorite show!
[104:01.31]I'm glad you brought it up.
[104:02.67]Wanna talk about it for a while?
[104:05.47]Let's do skill as well.
[104:09.07]You're not ready for this.
[104:11.42]She's not ready for this.
[104:13.00]It's a trained skill.
[104:20.08]I want a flower.
[104:21.52]I already have one.
[104:23.32]Take it.
[104:35.61]Pickle Rick.
[104:40.27]What the fuck?
[104:48.68]Can we add Pickle Rick to the banned memes?
[104:50.92]No, no, no, no.
[104:51.86]I'm gonna add Pickle Rick to the emotes.
[104:56.77]Oh, that would really, really piss some people off.
[105:00.89]What if I had... What if the rest of my emotes... I have like 15 emote slots that are empty.
[105:05.73]What if all of them were just different variations of Pickle Rick?
[105:10.83]15 different emote slots of Pickle Rick.
[105:19.57]I'm actually willing to do that for like a week.
[105:22.31]Just so new people that come into the stream despise me.
[105:26.78]You know?
[105:28.72]I don't want that.
[105:30.78]I don't want people to despise what I wanted.
[105:33.34]Something's wrong with me.
[105:40.03]I'd be like, oh my god, man, are you serious?
[105:42.43]Is this a joke?
[105:43.73]And everyone in the chat would obviously play along and be like, no, it's not.
[105:49.00]We're big, huge Morty fans here.
[105:51.50]Especially evil Morty.
[105:53.92]And I know enough about the show where I could pretend like I was a huge fan and I think it was actually... I wanted those.
[106:02.55]Go back to bed.
[106:05.81]We already despise you.
[106:09.93]Well, you do have the real Morty in your name.
[106:11.55]You are the real Morty, so... Come on, you're already... What's going on here?
[106:22.44]Let's go to battle.
[106:32.84]Well, why are these all, no.
[106:38.70]Rick and Morty Pog Champ.
[106:40.98]We'll do this one.
[106:46.76]Please do something.
[106:47.64]What do you mean do something?
[106:49.02]We have to do this.
[106:51.63]I can't win any tournaments.
[106:54.03]We have to do the baby boring shit.
[106:56.37]You're missing out on subs by having less emotes.
[107:09.91]Please do something interesting.
[107:11.17]Oh my god.
[107:12.29]What the hell?
[107:15.04]I'm just having fun in a video game, Morty.
[107:22.44]Who said that?
[107:22.96]What, is your name Morty?
[107:24.32]What was that person's name?
[107:26.26]I wanna see.
[107:28.98]Yeah, Mortylicious.
[107:30.60]Hmm.
[107:33.34]I don't know, let's do it again.
[107:42.46]Rick and Morty was canceled.
[107:45.72]Oh well.
[107:47.94]Wasn't it costing Cartoon Network like a fucking $50 million a season or something?
[107:54.24]Guys, he's talking about whose greatest achievement Adult Swim is doing reruns of Family Guy from an IP they don't even own.
[107:59.69]But it doesn't surprise me that they don't have enough money to do that. ...
[108:17.65]Woodylicious isn't real.
[108:22.77]I love Adult Swim.
[108:23.93]I was a huge Adult Swim.
[108:25.30]Dr. Steve Brule is one of my favorite shows ever made.
[108:27.68]I'm just fucking around.
[108:30.84]I'm just jabbing.
[108:31.98]It's just a joke.
[108:35.48]Alright, how is she doing?
[108:39.08]What do we got?
[108:40.22]We got F Battle.
[108:41.10]Nah, you're not ready for that.
[108:43.82]I would love to level up a point here and not have her just miss everything.
[108:51.12]She wants a flower every day.
[109:01.07]Wonder Shouzen?
[109:01.73]I remember Wonder Shouzen.
[109:04.73]Wasn't that show created by the guy that voiced Taoli on South Park?
[109:08.47]It's three.
[109:17.69]Alright, I think she's ready for a D tournament.
[109:25.04]Yeah, Xavier, Renegade Angel.
[109:27.90]Those are some odd shows.
[109:36.61]Start with E?
[109:37.37]Yeah, we're gonna do that.
[109:39.45]Didn't we already do E with her?
[109:40.87]Did we lose that tournament, though?
[109:41.87]I don't remember.
[109:48.24]Loyalty's so bad.
[109:52.14]Yeah, but we already did eat, didn't we?
[109:53.64]Didn't we already win?
[109:55.27]Well, let's just do it.
[109:55.93]We'll do Blizzard Cup again.
[109:57.29]Uh, rest, and then train, and then we'll do eat.
[110:12.48]Uh, well, if Adult Swim came to you and said they would make a show with you with no questions asked, but you had to eat someone with no repercussions, would you do it?
[110:22.20]Don't I don't think I would be able to do what do you mean no repercussions?
[110:25.78]Like all like the police are all standing around me being like yeah, man.
[110:28.76]Go for it.
[110:32.50]I Don't think I could do it.
[110:34.10]I wouldn't be able to I can't I wouldn't be able to eat somebody no Guys I get grossed out when grapes are like three days old And they're a little bit soggy and like withered looking I can't even eat those you want me to eat a person Three day old pizza
[110:51.78]I'm like, I don't know about that.
[110:54.04]I'm not going to handle that.
[110:57.34]Let's do skill again.
[111:01.56]No, don't do power.
[111:09.18]You wouldn't be able to eat someone for an adult swim show?
[111:12.22]I don't know.
[111:12.86]Would you be able to fucking eat somebody for an adult swim show?
[111:17.87]Why do I have to answer this question?
[111:20.42]All right, would you eat somebody for an Adult Swim TV show starring you?
[111:28.17]Bullshit.
[111:28.61]Anybody that says yes is a liar.
[111:30.89]No way.
[111:32.57]I don't believe it for a second.
[111:36.75]Yeah, right.
[111:37.13]You guys would take one bite and be like, you wouldn't be able to do it.
[111:42.32]You'd sit there and be like, alright, here we go, you'd psych yourself up and you'd grab, like, the forearm and be like, and then, and you'd, it would be over.
[111:50.07]And then the guy that would set up the whole fucked up situation would be like, I told you.
[111:53.69]No show for you.
[111:54.43]Now let's do E. Low loyalty, but it's alright.
[112:10.39]You have to okay.
[112:10.91]Hold on.
[112:11.15]Do you have to eat the whole way?
[112:12.36]This is important question Do you have to eat the whole person?
[112:16.56]immediately
[112:18.12]Or could I take this person, whoever it was, and take little small pieces of them and put them in like a smoothie, right?
[112:25.30]So take like an inch of them, like we're talking four centimeters of flesh, into a blender, like a smoothie, and eat them over like 15 years.
[112:34.79]No, but fuck, I wouldn't want to do that because then I would... I wouldn't... I would be like 50 by the time that my show was going to air.
[112:42.40]And I would be old and... No, that's not going to work.
[112:46.99]That sounds way worse.
[112:54.70]No, no, no.
[112:55.58]Alright, let's move on from this.
[112:57.94]We're done talking about this.
[112:59.36]Who brought this up?
[113:00.16]What's her name?
[113:02.02]Mortyfan221.
[113:02.58]Of course it was.
[113:15.13]I did not bring this up.
[113:16.51]Give me a break.
[113:17.43]Somebody asked me this in a question.
[113:18.95]Somebody asked me.
[113:19.51]I did not bring it up.
[113:20.73]Somebody... I almost just stopped the stream.
[113:23.39]I just bumped my keyboard over stop streaming and it almost just stopped.
[113:26.48]I clicked it almost.
[113:27.86]That was fucking close.
[113:32.60]Oh, we got Kick and Pat.
[113:33.70]Let's try Kick first.
[113:35.44]Nope, fooling around.
[113:40.72]This health is going to be an issue.
[113:42.10]This is an issue.
[113:44.30]I never should have came here.
[113:54.03]God damn it.
[114:45.80]10 whole damage.
[114:48.68]She needs a new move.
[114:49.84]I need to get her a new move.
[114:51.06]This is why I did the training in the first place, but everyone told me it was wrong.
[114:54.18]But do you see that she has pat and kick and they do four damage?
[114:57.48]This is why we needed a new technique.
[115:01.52]Hold on.
[115:12.14]Hey, German, what's the most embarrassing thing that's ever happened to me on stream?
[115:14.47]This tournament not included.
[115:18.57]When I played Karazhan for eight hours and lost over and over and over again for like maybe two or three hours straight on the same five-man dungeon boss.
[115:29.20]And you almost lost me on that stream.
[115:40.15]This is bad.
[115:41.39]He only has 57 HP.
[115:43.41]Can I at least win my money back?
[115:45.33]Can I just get my store credit back for training her?
[115:52.45]Come on.
[115:52.93]He's 57 damage.
[115:54.69]You're telling me I can't get close?
[115:56.83]Get close enough where I can do it.
[115:57.93]I can't do anything.
[115:59.79]I have 99 guts.
[116:00.85]I can't get close enough.
[116:02.33]And she's just fooled every time.
[116:05.70]I need to do one move.
[116:07.88]Just one.
[116:09.12]Just let me do one move.
[116:10.48]Do one move and win.
[116:13.33]That's okay.
[116:13.75]Do it again.
[116:14.51]Just spam this.
[116:16.27]Eventually, I'll get enough damage.
[116:18.71]No, that's over.
[116:19.29]I have to get a crit or something.
[116:21.55]No, that's not...
[116:41.02]Int errantry.
[116:41.80]I know, but it's not a guarantee.
[116:45.42]Should I do... I'm going to save and do an intelligence errantry.
[116:48.88]And... No, don't give up.
[116:55.99]Battle.
[116:56.65]Do it.
[117:04.59]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[117:05.29]Hold on.
[117:06.33]Somebody's got info here.
[117:08.11]Shit, it's gone.
[117:08.67]I have to...
[117:12.02]Nobody write anything in the chat.
[117:12.98]Everybody stop talking.
[117:13.76]Nobody write anything.
[117:14.34]Hold on.
[117:14.66]I'm trying to... I can't scroll up.
[117:17.03]Everyone be quiet.
[117:17.53]Nobody write anything right now.
[117:18.67]Stop talking.
[117:19.11]Ready?
[117:19.51]Go.
[117:25.13]I can't... I can't see it.
[117:28.93]Everyone just stop typing.
[117:30.79]Just don't type for 10 seconds.
[117:32.28]It's already gone.
[117:38.78]Do a little...
[117:43.33]Kick.
[117:44.19]Kick.
[117:46.81]Kick.
[117:47.27]Don't be so confused.
[117:48.47]Kick.
[117:52.21]Pat the dog.
[117:52.77]Can I at least pat the dog once?
[117:54.36]Because I want to pat the dog because dogs are cool.
[117:56.98]See?
[118:02.58]Can I win this one?
[118:06.50]I've been reading up on Monster Hunter Fusion a bit.
[118:08.94]If you want something good to come up...
[118:10.81]Alright, I got it.
[118:11.47]Thanks, guys.
[118:12.33]Appreciate it.
[118:13.69]So the stats have to be normal across the board.
[118:17.40]They're pretty much very close.
[118:18.40]I think we just won a one match here.
[118:19.90]No, we didn't.
[118:20.32]Come on, what's the... No, don't ruin the percentages!
[119:10.17]Where was my save?
[119:11.37]It was before we took it to the farm, right?
[119:17.06]I'm getting my money back.
[119:18.80]I'm issuing a refund by hitting the reset button on PS1.
[119:27.12]Because that was right before I took it to the farm, right?
[119:30.73]That just requires a reset refund, right?
[119:33.23]A refund reset.
[119:42.77]Now, just doing a quick refund reset, sorry.
[119:51.37]That was like two or three thousand dollars that just went nowhere.
[120:09.18]Go into the store and see if I can buy a good monster.
[120:10.92]That's not a bad idea.
[120:11.76]I'll try that.
[120:13.00]Thank that one guy.
[120:13.64]What's his name?
[120:14.50]That guy, if I want to thank him.
[120:17.72]Uh, his name is... The, uh... Gazorpazorp.
[120:23.33]Uh, Field.
[120:24.63]Another Rick and Morty reference.
[120:26.21]Thanks, man.
[120:28.49]Oh, that's a long game.
[120:35.24]Okay.
[120:48.04]Yeah, we're gonna see if we can buy something.
[120:57.33]Cut it out with the Rick and Mortimer crap.
[121:00.63]I appreciate that you're concerned, Plumbus, but... I mean, it's just, these are, this is what... Oh, ah, wait.
[121:08.91]How far away was this?
[121:09.81]How long ago was this?
[121:13.54]How long ago was this?
[121:14.68]I'm actually, like, kind of scared.
[121:16.34]No, no, 10, 16, okay, we're fine.
[121:19.04]This is right before we, um... Okay, that's fine.
[121:37.22]This is after the final tournament.
[121:38.38]Alright, that's cool.
[121:40.03]So, let's freeze him.
[121:41.47]Let's go to the market and see if any- because if there's somebody worth buying, it might be worth it.
[121:44.89]Just instead of dumping in random CDs that don't do anything anymore.
[121:48.19]Because we've seen a lot- I think we've pretty much seen all the base monsters that you can make in Monster Hunter 2.
[121:55.18]No progress made.
[121:56.26]Well, we made- there was progress for the last hour or two.
[121:59.84]We made like $11,000.
[122:01.50]So, there you go.
[122:02.78]Freeze him.
[122:08.44]here comes the music again I'll help you guys there ah I didn't say I wasn't gonna like beatbox this song I'm just kidding I won't do it I'm just kidding it's so funny oh jeremy welcome hi what would you like to do get
[122:37.48]As the season changes, so does the selection of monsters.
[122:40.18]Please choose a monster you like.
[122:42.60]I mean, these are all the same.
[122:44.04]These things suck.
[122:52.19]Oh, whoops.
[122:54.81]There we go.
[122:57.63]We have to...
[123:00.28]We need to find, we need to just pull out somebody that we know we can play with, but it has to be somebody that's compatible with Kira as well.
[123:06.24]You know what I'm saying?
[123:07.80]So it's, what about like Jax Rex?
[123:10.34]He's very basic.
[123:14.32]You know, he's good enough with his stats and his skills.
[123:18.09]He's just a, well, like maybe Ed, no, I don't want to play with Edgehog again.
[123:21.07]What about Jax Rex?
[123:23.25]What did we get for this?
[123:24.61]What's possible here?
[123:28.14]Like 154, 134, good life, decent defense.
[123:31.44]It might not be that stupid of an idea to just play with one of the good monsters.
[123:35.98]Just to level them up to get stats to combine.
[123:37.48]There's a CD list on GameFAQs.
[123:41.38]Is there really?
[123:41.80]Probably should look it up.
[123:42.70]Let's see what we get.
[123:45.82]Out of curiosity.
[123:52.12]Doesn't look good.
[123:56.19]Why would it not look good?
[124:03.73]Oh, putting enough CD.
[124:08.09]Did we do Men in Black in this game?
[124:11.43]Is this the Scream CD?
[124:13.98]I think this is the Scream CD.
[124:15.20]Let's try the Scream CD.
[124:24.75]We gotta get something decent, right?
[124:28.33]We could do... But Lorax Brimley, his stats are just awful.
[124:34.44]No, let's do the Scream City.
[124:41.01]Let's see what we can pull off of this.
[124:51.05]Don't fuse cure, or not yet at least.
[124:54.25]Get a monster from the store.
[124:55.35]Well, the monsters from the store were just default dinosaurs.
[125:01.51]It was a default dinosaur, default rabbit, and they weren't anything interesting.
[125:06.09]Alright, come on.
[125:08.89]Not like a rare one, just a decent, good, base-level monster with good stats.
[125:14.49]Okay, well, we have to... Go play The Forest?
[125:28.20]That early access game, The Forest?
[125:34.12]Might just use Jax Rex here.
[125:35.88]Yeah, I think so.
[125:36.90]We got one more opportunity to wow me here.
[125:42.60]Last opportunity to wow me.
[125:44.26]We're going to put in original point blank.
[125:47.39]Because we haven't done this on this game.
[125:51.49]Harvester?
[125:52.15]I don't own the Harvester CD.
[125:53.71]I bought it from Good Old Games.
[125:55.39]I don't actually own the CD.
[125:59.07]No, I bought it on Steam, actually.
[126:02.20]So I don't have a CD of Harvester.
[126:14.13]Have I ever played Don't Starve?
[126:15.11]I have.
[126:15.33]I'm not a huge fan.
[126:19.27]It was cool for a little while, but not enough to grab me for me to play it for a long time.
[126:22.61]Alright, something worth playing.
[126:33.09]Burn the data of Harvester to a disk.
[126:36.80]Come on, I don't want rare monsters last attempt.
[126:41.56]I'm gonna do this one last time.
[126:43.54]I don't care what the CD is Fuck me I Got another one over here who's over here?
[126:55.41]Who is it?
[126:55.71]What do you want?
[127:04.04]Don't be a rare monster.
[127:05.60]Be a good base monster.
[127:10.93]Why not a rare monster?
[127:11.75]Because I physically cannot use a rare monster until later in the game.
[127:16.25]Like, I have to either beat the game, essentially, with one monster, or I have to go on an expedition and find a material to make a rare monster.
[127:24.80]I can't.
[127:25.46]I just can't do it.
[127:26.62]I cannot pull it out from a regular CD.
[127:28.10]I have to wait until I'm higher ranked.
[127:32.46]So we have to get good base stats, something good.
[127:35.38]If not, then we're just going to use Jax Rex.
[127:45.29]Jax Rex it is.
[127:47.29]If we do not get something good here.
[127:50.29]So give us something good.
[127:56.37]It's either that or we have to get Tim Allen leveled up.
[127:58.87]We have to spend a bunch of money.
[128:03.67]not rare not rare and don't soft lock on me don't do this oh my lord why is everything a rare monster hell
[128:37.29]This is the last thing.
[128:38.25]I'm not doing this again.
[128:39.95]Last opportunity.
[128:41.01]This is it.
[128:41.97]Or we're just leveling up.
[128:51.48]I need to redefine the term rare.
[128:53.80]Yes.
[128:55.12]They do.
[129:01.10]Yeah, I don't like that stipulation.
[129:03.39]I'm not a fan of that.
[129:06.62]What's the point?
[129:07.72]I guess maybe because the rare monsters probably have way better stats and they're designed to do all the later tournaments better, easier, I don't know.
[129:20.39]Alright, if it does it again.
[129:22.11]Here's the big moment.
[129:23.43]Finally.
[129:24.95]It only took us like six tries to get a monster.
[129:28.38]We got a reaction here.
[129:29.04]Here we go.
[129:47.69]It's a green bunny.
[129:52.79]It's a Slimer from Ghostbusters.
[129:54.55]That's who it is.
[129:55.13]Slimer.
[129:57.10]Cute.
[129:57.52]Stats.
[129:59.12]I think I could work with this.
[130:03.86]Slimer.
[130:12.07]Pickle Rick.
[130:28.48]Fuck, I want to do that.
[130:30.32]No, I'll hate it.
[130:31.60]I'll hate it.
[130:32.28]It's Slimer.
[130:33.86]Slimer Rick.
[130:37.63]Slime Time Life.
[130:39.35]Slime Time Life.
[130:41.97]Good call.
[130:43.45]Slime Time... Isn't that... Wait, isn't that the... Nickelodeon, right?
[130:48.81]Yeah.
[130:49.11]Slime Time Life.
[130:54.66]No, I don't... It's not... It's not going to be Pickle Rick.
[130:57.00]Not happening.
[130:58.78]Slime Time Live.
[131:00.32]L-V-E.
[131:07.02]No.
[131:07.78]I'm not naming it anything to do with Pickle Rick, okay?
[131:11.74]Aquaman has spoken!
[131:44.19]Fucking idiot.
[131:50.37]I was about to just hit the power button and like go back to when... I was about to just fucking mash on that power button.
[131:56.26]I'm not even kidding.
[132:05.45]Good base stats.
[132:06.85]Good speed.
[132:07.93]Good... Get that fucking camera off.
[132:11.29]Good base speed, bad intelligence, don't matter.
[132:13.39]We don't have any... Not good life, not good defense.
[132:19.55]Peer pressure claims another soul.
[132:21.23]I don't even want this.
[132:22.31]I can't wait to mix them together.
[132:23.56]I just fucking put them in a blender.
[132:27.28]And just blend them up with something else.
[132:28.92]We didn't even look and see what the combination was!
[132:41.88]He doesn't suck.
[132:43.50]That's 150 base power.
[132:45.06]That's really good.
[132:48.26]Let's see if this... There's so much indecision with these monsters.
[132:56.11]Why is he doing Gangnam Style?
[132:58.83]I don't know.
[132:59.27]I don't know.
[133:01.21]He just turned into a booger under a desk.
[133:08.60]Good.
[133:12.57]What is the combination if I do this?
[133:15.57]Something decent, right?
[133:20.19]With a disc chip.
[133:21.09]Let me make it be something decent, something good.
[133:25.69]The prospect is unsure.
[133:29.74]There is an edgehog.
[133:35.26]Scaled hair.
[133:37.20]There is an edgehog.
[133:42.33]Did we already see this?
[133:51.40]There's Edgehog.
[133:52.14]There's the Edgehog.
[133:52.86]Alright, so we're going to level up Scaled Hair and we're going to try to get Edgehog.
[134:08.37]It's a real Edgehog.
[134:15.77]Don't do it.
[134:16.61]Level them up first.
[134:18.93]Somebody just said to just put the Monster Rancher 2 disc in and it'll give you a random monster of a base monster.
[134:28.05]You got it.
[134:28.89]Disc system.
[134:30.58]Put it in.
[134:31.24]Monster Rancher 2.
[134:32.78]Get that reaction here.
[134:36.16]I'm ready to give you guys a whoa or a dude or a huh or a fuck.
[134:43.10]Which one's it gonna be?
[134:45.20]Dude.
[134:46.16]What?
[134:47.02]Fuck.
[134:47.88]No.
[134:48.60]Which one?
[134:49.02]Come on.
[134:49.34]What am I going to do?
[135:01.97]No, dude.
[135:04.61]Burn it.
[135:17.32]It's not bad.
[135:18.66]No.
[135:26.28]Ready?
[135:27.00]What's it gonna be this time?
[135:27.72]Here we go.
[135:45.16]Typical streamer, typical YouTuber.
[136:25.10]I think maybe we should just pull out.
[136:26.76]I don't know.
[136:32.42]I don't know.
[136:34.34]It might be worth just pulling out one of these guys.
[136:36.78]180 power.
[136:37.44]170 power.
[136:48.26]180 power.
[136:50.02]Just pull out Louise and level up Louise.
[136:56.50]I'm gonna do it.
[136:57.04]Let's just get Louise out here and make something happen.
[137:00.07]For the love of God.
[137:02.98]Come on out.
[137:03.71]Suck them out.
[137:07.06]All right, let's do another big reaction here.
[137:37.36]A bit scary looking, isn't it?
[137:43.18]178 power, 165 skill.
[137:49.55]Yes, take him.
[137:51.39]Good stats.
[137:52.45]Good.
[137:53.49]New name.
[137:53.93]Fucking Ivan Ooze.
[138:08.02]No, Ivanooz.
[138:20.03]No, it's changing to Ivanooz.
[138:23.79]Ghost Rick.
[138:28.48]No.
[138:31.04]Now, just... Everybody calm down.
[138:33.34]I know we've been taking some time here.
[138:36.20]Relax for a second.
[138:38.85]Most people in my chat don't know who that is.
[138:40.72]Type it into Google and find out.
[138:42.66]And by golly, will you have a movie to watch in your spare time.
[138:49.74]Freeze them.
[138:50.12]Let's see what happens when we combine them.
[138:52.24]I just need to know.
[138:53.38]Too many monsters.
[138:55.36]And for those records.
[139:03.66]You've been chopped.
[139:06.82]Wait, what?
[139:16.44]I'm not going to delete Tim Allen because Tim Allen might combine with somebody.
[139:23.54]Combine.
[139:24.16]I just need to make sure this is going to be worth doing.
[139:27.52]Because if he's like, oh, that's terrible.
[139:29.38]Then, you know what?
[139:30.06]Maybe I just don't even give a fuck.
[139:32.66]You know?
[139:36.36]Use a secret seasoning ingredient.
[139:40.30]Use the culinary curveball.
[139:41.62]It's disc chips.
[139:42.88]Chips of Kato's disc.
[139:48.23]Chips of Gelsdisk.
[139:49.81]Okay, wait, I've not even... I've not paid any attention to the different disk chips.
[139:55.03]Chips.
[139:55.35]Why am I saying it like that?
[139:55.99]Disk chips.
[139:58.03]This combination doesn't look so good.
[140:00.36]Oh, great.
[140:07.60]Fuck.
[140:16.13]What if we do the other chips?
[140:25.79]Let's try the other disc chip.
[140:29.81]Put it in.
[140:32.09]And this combination doesn't look good.
[140:33.93]So it's not good.
[140:35.13]What about Tim Allen and... It'll be better when you train him?
[140:40.08]Maybe.
[140:40.38]I don't know.
[140:42.92]Let's just see what happens if it's Tim Allen and Ivanews.
[140:48.72]Otherwise, Ivanews is just good stat-wise.
[140:51.17]We can level him up.
[140:59.74]This prospect is fine.
[141:00.68]It will probably work out.
[141:02.08]Alright, hold on a minute here.
[141:03.32]Hold on a second.
[141:05.37]What is Allure?
[141:07.07]That seems kind of decent.
[141:16.51]Allure?
[141:25.02]Let me save it first.
[141:27.48]Allure is one of the pixies.
[141:28.66]Okay, but is that... Pixies are boring.
[141:30.86]Pixies are not good.
[141:35.24]This guy knows his shit.
[141:36.10]I should trust him.
[141:37.38]We might get Trident.
[141:40.38]Let me flip it around.
[141:41.04]And see what happens.
[141:46.71]So let's go with Ivanooz first.
[141:50.19]And then Tim Allen.
[141:53.83]And no secret seasoning.
[141:56.83]Alright, so we get Ripper, Allure.
[142:00.37]Then we have a high chance to get Ripper or Allure here.
[142:09.05]Yeah, alright, we're gonna do Naga and Tim Allen, try to get Ripper or Allure.
[142:13.70]Let me save it, though.
[142:15.56]You only get the top result with disc chips.
[142:18.14]Well, I mean, I think that's good enough odds anyways.
[142:21.12]Because Trident is kind of cool.
[142:23.00]These all seem kind of cool.
[142:30.79]All right, let's... Don't forget your seasoning.
[142:34.10]Ripper's God Tear.
[142:36.26]Yeah, let's save it, and then we'll do that.
[142:38.30]And whatever we get from there, guys, we're going to just play for it.
[142:40.52]I'm going to do a good training.
[142:45.46]Save the game, just in case something terrible happens.
[142:52.04]Here comes a wall.
[142:54.50]Just right here is fine.
[142:59.84]Alright.
[143:00.72]Lab.
[143:01.30]Combine.
[143:03.68]If this doesn't work, then I'll use the seasoning.
[143:06.56]Allure is god tier as well.
[143:10.32]Alright, well let's not fuck it up, huh?
[143:13.56]So we're gonna go with... Ivan Ooze.
[143:18.80]And then Tim Allen.
[143:20.62]No seasoning.
[143:21.28]Let's see if we can just get it.
[143:24.70]Ripper or Allure.
[143:25.98]Should we proceed?
[143:27.28]Get a streamer reaction on here.
[143:39.17]I'm so happy.
[143:40.03]I'm so happy about this CC I don't know whatever
[144:03.97]Don't take him to the ranch.
[144:05.69]No.
[144:10.50]He's worse than the original one that I had.
[144:13.48]Uh-huh.
[144:16.38]Yeah, that's kind of dumb.
[144:18.74]Bring it back.
[144:21.79]Bring it back and we'll put in some seasoning.
[144:24.63]Make sure we get the... Good one.
[144:28.75]Save's coming on Monster Rancher.
[144:30.13]Why the hell wouldn't I?
[144:32.55]I want to make out with something good.
[144:37.33]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[144:38.49]Somebody wrote something.
[144:39.35]Somebody just wrote something.
[144:40.48]Stop talking.
[144:41.14]Somebody just wrote something.
[144:41.88]Let's see.
[144:42.10]Got it right here.
[144:44.20]I just copy and pasted it myself.
[144:46.30]What does it say?
[144:49.55]Nobody say anything for a second.
[144:50.47]I want to copy and paste this.
[145:14.64]Okay.
[145:15.50]Got it.
[145:17.84]Thank you.
[145:20.50]Thank you!
[145:30.76]Combine.
[145:32.10]Drop a little bit of salt in there.
[145:33.26]Drop a little bit of celery salt in there.
[145:35.70]Just like that.
[145:36.90]Make sure, when it sticks to your hand, fuck cooking.
[145:38.90]The salt gets on your hand, you gotta go like this.
[145:40.88]Bah!
[145:41.28]Have somebody else do it for me.
[145:43.16]All right, let's do Ivanoo's.
[145:47.52]Tim Allen.
[145:49.04]Seasoning Salt.
[145:53.30]Which one?
[145:54.49]Probably this one, right?
[145:55.21]This prospect is fine.
[146:01.11]Ripper or Allure.
[146:02.19]Whatever one it is.
[146:02.87]I'm hoping for Ripper.
[146:04.57]I'm a little bit biased on here.
[146:08.99]Go.
[146:11.75]That's why you wash your hands.
[146:12.81]Somebody else will do it.
[146:26.77]How what I used a chip I Used a goddamn disk chip I used a disk chip I Just ran I don't doesn't matter Glock is always six seven eight.
[146:44.86]Oh
[147:07.44]Now that's a Rick and Morty character name.
[147:09.44]That really is.
[147:13.17]What happened there?
[147:14.33]Somebody explain that to me.
[147:16.47]What the F, man?
[147:18.25]What the heck happened there?
[147:20.23]PG stream for the rest of the night.
[147:24.16]What the crazy heck happened there, man?
[147:35.94]I don't understand what happened.
[147:37.16]But we'll do Tim Allen first.
[147:40.44]Chips don't affect outcomes.
[147:41.58]So people are just lying to me?
[147:42.68]What the heck, man?
[147:43.36]What the absolute heckfire?
[147:51.75]Allure is up there.
[147:54.45]So what does the chip actually do then?
[147:57.01]Oh my gosh, darn it.
[148:07.11]Somebody tell me, nobody debate me.
[148:14.54]Does it matter?
[148:17.48]It just raises stats.
[148:18.78]Google it yourself.
[148:20.40]Yeah, but I mean, I'm streaming right now.
[148:23.30]I'm live.
[148:25.19]What do disk chips do Monster Rancher 2?
[148:34.19]Disk chips, question mark?
[148:37.25]Recently started replaying this game, just stopping in the second grade or so when I clearly hadn't quite a mastery or grasped any concepts of it.
[148:45.26]I missed loads of disc chips and wondering what exactly they do they do.
[148:49.56]I know it was a sneezing, but can anyone while reframing from rudely stating the obvious as a seasoning, LOL, tell me just what that means?
[148:58.34]If you just look to the third thread on this list, it asks the same question.
[149:01.24]You could also have found this by looking at the very first fact listed.
[149:03.72]All right, all right, all right, buddy.
[149:05.12]Calm down.
[149:06.06]Guy asked a question.
[149:08.49]Disk chips sell for.
[149:09.87]So it adds like battle moves and shit.
[149:22.37]Hold on a minute.
[149:31.43]Nobody knows what the fuck they do.
[149:35.28]What are the disc chips for?
[149:36.78]In the description they say they are a secret, sassening, but it says, Tiger Suezo, but I combine and none of the monster disc appears.
[149:45.18]Hey those, and this is a reply, hey those are for the string, or well something like that, don't worry.
[149:52.00]Disc chips lead your monster closer to the type of chips.
[149:55.67]For example, Suezo plus Zoom and Zoom chips, it would most likely be a yellow Zoom or just a Zoom.
[150:02.38]Each chip has a special property.
[150:04.24]When used to combined, it will add stats to the result monster.
[150:07.90]For example, Pixie's disc chip adds the effect plus 50 intelligence.
[150:12.81]So the monster that comes out will have plus 50 intelligence.
[150:15.19]Every disc chip has a different property.
[150:17.36]You will have find them out for yourself.
[150:39.37]I'm gonna use it.
[150:40.01]I'm gonna use it.
[150:42.61]I want fucking chips on there.
[150:44.41]What does that one do?
[150:46.46]So we're gonna do Tim Allen.
[150:49.50]Yes.
[150:51.70]And then we're gonna put on Kato's chip.
[150:57.25]I wrote that post.
[150:58.29]I don't have to appreciate you mocking me.
[151:02.89]That wasn't you.
[151:03.55]I read like five different posts.
[151:13.73]Alright, Ivan Ooze, here we go.
[151:16.71]Train more- I need to get a fused monster!
[151:27.47]I'm not- I'm using a disc chip!
[151:33.96]I went to like three different websites!
[151:36.28]Would you want all of them?
[151:38.26]If so, thank you so much for your contribution to Monster Ranch 2.
[151:42.38]It was mine.
[151:47.93]Wait, so you were the guy talking about being in the second grade?
[151:50.27]I don't buy that for a second.
[151:52.69]I don't buy that.
[152:03.06]All right, let me do this.
[152:11.10]Kato is plus one, so more intelligence.
[152:13.36]All right, so let's not do that.
[152:21.99]What about this one?
[152:22.47]What does the jelly one do?
[152:26.70]It's me.
[152:27.38]Eat chips.
[152:28.36]Alright, I'm going to look up jelly chip.
[152:31.18]I mean, a lot of stuff is really obscure random info that's not anywhere.
[152:34.98]I just typed in jelly chip disk chip and I got my casino website.
[152:56.47]I guess it's a learning experience.
[153:01.21]So I'm supposed to just do it.
[153:12.21]Jokers are evil.
[153:17.88]Okay.
[153:21.18]This music is still going.
[153:23.12]Personally, I tend to sell disc chips for cash.
[153:26.45]You can get a pretty penny from disc chips.
[153:29.11]The tournaments that give out precious metals are more profitable.
[153:32.01]So I guess it's not even that big of a deal.
[153:38.06]I'm just going to use it.
[153:38.84]I don't even care.
[153:39.48]We're just going for it.
[153:42.83]Give us a lure right now.
[153:44.01]3, 2, 1, action.
[153:45.19]Go.
[153:51.27]Everyone, look, everyone wants me to know what to do, but just skip.
[153:54.87]Skip this.
[153:55.69]We got it.
[153:56.03]That's what I've done.
[153:56.63]We got Allure.
[153:57.89]We got the Demon Lady.
[153:58.77]Good.
[154:27.81]Demon Debbie Ripper is better than the Laura.
[154:40.08]We got a play.
[154:41.74]I've been sitting like 35 minutes Well, what I wish I got four moves
[155:00.46]I'm not gonna be able to get... Don't!
[155:02.86]You don't have to reset it.
[155:06.99]I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to get Ripper.
[155:12.71]Alright, I'm gonna try for Ripper one more time, guys, and then we gotta go.
[155:18.65]Last try, we're gonna try to get Ripper one more time with a disk chip and see what happens.
[155:29.31]What disk chip did we use last time?
[155:42.53]This is the last one.
[155:48.47]So we used the gel last time.
[155:49.52]So we're going to do this one now.
[155:57.80]Alright, here we go.
[155:59.58]Ripper has a high chance.
[156:04.52]Let's just go for it.
[156:05.29]Is that him?
[156:19.03]No, it's Pixie.
[156:21.14]Fuck.
[156:23.34]I didn't even see the stats.
[156:27.61]It's just Strawberry Shortcake, whatever that cartoon.
[156:30.97]I'm just gonna write SS for Strawberry Shortcake.
[156:44.34]No, everyone wants me to reload.
[156:45.75]Guys, we gotta go.
[156:47.21]I wanna play the game.
[156:54.67]That's a hundred and seventy intelligence, but fuck that's terrible life.
[156:57.77]Oh my god That's it last one last fucking time last one that's it no more we're done after this 51 health it was if it was one even one point higher
[157:30.81]Otherwise, we're just going to play with Ivanoo's.
[157:35.27]What the hell?
[157:35.77]Where is it?
[157:44.52]What about like a flower or something?
[157:46.62]No, or anything.
[157:47.38]I'm going to play with Ivan if this doesn't work.
[158:01.95]Can't use nut oil.
[158:10.99]Just go.
[158:11.47]No disc.
[158:11.97]Just try it.
[158:17.15]I think it keeps the save state.
[158:21.25]We got it.
[158:21.55]We got it.
[158:22.55]Got him.
[158:24.37]Ripper.
[158:26.47]Bye.
[158:26.81]Goodbye.
[158:27.31]See you later.
[158:27.75]Bye.
[158:38.77]Good.
[158:39.19]We can play.
[158:39.87]Sayonara.
[158:43.01]Gotta give it a name.
[158:43.79]Good name.
[158:50.41]What's the boss's name from Mortal Kombat?
[158:54.61]Shao Kahn?
[158:55.87]Shredder?
[158:57.37]Terrible stats.
[159:00.81]Good stats.
[159:02.31]It'll get better.
[159:03.25]Don't worry.
[159:10.10]How about Mr. Ice Cream?
[159:15.12]That's terrible.
[159:16.40]I'm sticking with it because we need to play.
[159:18.96]I'm done sitting here.
[159:20.32]Mr. Ice Cream.
[159:21.36]That's the first thing I thought of.
[159:41.65]There, Mr. Ice Cream.
[159:43.15]Done.
[159:47.31]Get him to the ranch.
[159:56.46]Okay, so, hey, what's going on, everybody?
[159:58.42]Thanks for sticking around.
[159:59.44]We're gonna be playing some Monster Rancher 2.
[160:02.42]And the funny thing about this game, you combine monsters and you make new ones.
[160:05.46]And it's so fun, it's so funny.
[160:07.80]My new guy's name is Mr. Ice Cream.
[160:09.98]Whoa!
[160:11.56]What?
[160:11.88]Look at him, he's dancing around like he's doing a fun dancing move.
[160:16.20]He believes all he belongs on stage and dancing around.
[160:18.52]Remember to follow, though.
[160:20.60]What the fuck was that?
[160:30.37]Hold on, wait, wait.
[160:31.23]That was actually fucking awesome.
[160:36.03]Please do that again.
[160:37.20]I should have named him the bathrobe.
[160:38.62]God damn it.
[160:42.86]Ugh.
[160:45.40]Alright, what do we got for training here?
[160:50.15]Belly Punch and Thwack.
[160:56.81]I'm not resetting.
[160:57.55]I don't care.
[160:58.01]It's Mr. Ice Cream.
[161:00.19]It's the worst fucking character name ever.
[161:01.77]But I don't care.
[161:02.41]That's the first thing I thought of.
[161:03.35]It's over.
[161:11.04]Power and skill only.
[161:13.52]Literally nothing else.
[161:17.78]No, it's Mr. Ice Cream.
[161:19.84]I could have named him Skeksy.
[161:20.98]I could have named him the Bathrobe.
[161:22.38]I was under a lot of pressure because everyone wanted me to leave.
[161:27.21]He just looks like strawberry ice cream.
[161:29.49]No, he doesn't.
[161:30.25]That's so bad.
[161:31.05]Well, yeah, because he could be like a dripping ice cream cone.
[161:33.49]That's what I was thinking of.
[161:37.51]Give him the item that increases his stats permanently.
[161:39.85]Let's do it.
[161:42.32]So that is... What is it?
[161:45.75]Man Satan?
[161:47.39]Life and skill will increase.
[161:48.91]However, speed will decrease.
[161:51.45]So this is permanent.
[161:53.33]I give him like a Zippo lighter and he drinks the gas inside.
[161:59.45]What about the boots?
[162:00.07]Can I give him those too?
[162:08.13]Two drugs.
[162:09.91]Let's give it to him.
[162:13.48]Okay, are you sure?
[162:15.17]Yes.
[162:21.69]Drink that Zippo of lighter fluid.
[162:27.08]Okay, now let's look at his stats.
[162:33.60]Nah, it's all right.
[162:38.41]So let's go to training.
[162:40.49]And we're not going to do Errantry yet.
[162:42.04]We're just going to make him.
[162:42.92]We're going to level up power.
[162:44.04]We're just going to do it slowly.
[162:51.64]Sorry.
[162:52.14]Sometimes you fail.
[162:57.14]Don't scold him yet.
[163:05.35]Mr. Ice Cream is well...
[163:08.27]Now, let's see what he likes.
[163:12.50]He likes battle, see?
[163:14.52]He likes to fight.
[163:15.36]He doesn't like Cup of Jelly, so don't give it to him.
[163:17.90]He likes to fight.
[163:18.70]Good.
[163:20.64]These two moves are terrible, but it's okay.
[163:22.20]We're doing power anyways.
[163:23.87]Just don't fuck it up.
[163:26.89]You need to be louder.
[163:30.85]It's at a good temperature right now, I think.
[163:33.09]The streams, um... There we go.
[163:39.09]Yeah, he's a fighting monster.
[163:40.23]So we can give him milk.
[163:48.46]It's fine.
[163:49.16]Remember, he's still a baby.
[163:56.60]Base boost my voice.
[163:58.48]There we go.
[164:03.75]Plus three.
[164:04.25]That's alright.
[164:04.77]He's doing alright.
[164:11.22]What about the other ones we got?
[164:12.18]These ones down here.
[164:13.20]I should do this one.
[164:15.14]Pull?
[164:16.43]Or... Yeah, I'll do pull.
[164:22.07]Gains are low at baby levels.
[164:23.27]Yep, that's true.
[164:23.77]Come on, make it up there.
[164:26.25]Be a good reindeer.
[164:32.67]There we go.
[164:33.05]Okay.
[164:36.67]You haven't paid property taxes on this ranch in years.
[164:41.47]Uh, oh well.
[164:43.15]Let's give him milk.
[164:45.51]He's a baby, he needs it.
[164:52.72]The name Mr. Ice Cream is the worst name.
[164:54.30]I know people are trickling it and they just like, they think I'm a dumb, they think I'm a dumb idiot dummy.
[164:59.74]Skip the cutscenes?
[165:00.76]Um, yeah, that's not, don't worry, I'm gonna start skipping.
[165:06.28]I mean, should I do cheap Errantry?
[165:08.74]If it's Errantry, I should just do it if it's cheap, right?
[165:10.92]What's the problem?
[165:14.04]Yeah, I'm doing it.
[165:14.68]He's stressed out.
[165:15.68]Give him a fucking leaf.
[165:20.01]Take a rest.
[165:22.31]Try to get a power move.
[165:32.25]Everything's on sale.
[165:39.62]I'm going to be too young for it.
[165:40.56]He's well.
[165:47.48]It said he was stressed.
[165:49.92]Let's give him a mint leaf.
[165:55.11]I could take this, too.
[165:57.29]You get really popular if you eat that.
[165:58.93]It's kind of cool.
[166:00.29]I don't have any, huh?
[166:01.35]He's too young.
[166:06.84]What is that move there?
[166:12.12]Let's do skill.
[166:18.09]He's not going to get good gains.
[166:19.15]Just do this until he's older.
[166:22.63]Well, he's cheating.
[166:32.21]It's gold.
[166:39.28]He's too young for Errantry.
[166:43.47]That's alright.
[166:46.47]Let's do... Again, this time don't screw it up, please.
[166:52.27]There you go.
[166:57.60]Let him cheat.
[166:58.20]No, you can't let him cheat, because then he'll get too... You spoiled him.
[167:08.79]Alright, let's... Let's save it.
[167:18.81]It's nice how the assistant has never aged.
[167:20.91]Yeah, that is weird.
[167:23.25]Alright.
[167:27.73]Have a little bit of rest.
[167:36.89]Give him the shoe.
[167:40.29]Give him the shoe.
[167:41.35]He needs more milk.
[167:55.14]Resident Leaper?
[168:00.74]I'm really upset.
[168:03.22]Stressed out.
[168:05.75]Okay, I'm soft right now.
[168:07.59]I get 10 loyalty.
[168:10.45]Is everything still on sale?
[168:11.49]Or did I miss that?
[168:17.33]Shh, fuck.
[168:24.06]Use the leaf.
[168:32.95]You hate his scream.
[168:35.73]Come on, now you got... Why would he... I lost loyalty by giving him a rest.
[168:42.94]Let's go with this one.
[168:43.96]We're gonna do this one.
[168:44.82]This is the official cup.
[168:47.64]We're gonna get him to D, and we're gonna farm D for a little while.
[168:52.07]So one, two, and then a day of rest.
[168:54.07]Training, drill, get some power.
[169:01.31]Can you... He's cheating again.
[169:05.53]I have to correct him, I have to scold him.
[169:08.33]Because otherwise he's gonna keep going soft and he'll go to doting.
[169:11.33]I'm gonna lose loyalty but I have to.
[169:14.49]Do it again.
[169:23.46]This time please don't do this shit.
[169:32.22]One more of these.
[169:38.54]Thank you.
[169:39.06]Thank you for doing it right.
[169:41.19]Alright, here it is.
[169:50.89]One day of rest and then we're gonna go to E and we're gonna use him, see how he is.
[169:58.70]He looks like Jafar from the end of Aladdin.
[170:01.32]He actually fucking really does.
[170:06.34]Hey, the official tournament is happening this week.
[170:07.90]Mr. Ice Cream seems in pretty good shape.
[170:10.79]I think he can handle it.
[170:15.87]This monster sucks.
[170:16.79]Don't say that.
[170:17.51]He doesn't suck.
[170:25.12]I think he can handle it.
[170:26.00]At least E. Just get him to E.
[170:35.66]Feed him a burnt snake.
[170:40.74]We all know what's going on here.
[170:42.22]We just need to win.
[170:46.98]Get a new technique for... I thought everyone was telling me not to do that because it would be expensive and he won't get any stats.
[170:54.40]Wasn't everyone just telling me not to do that?
[171:03.63]He might learn lifesteal.
[171:04.51]That would be awesome.
[171:07.92]Yeah, he's in a good spot.
[171:10.68]His defense isn't that great, but I feel like he can hit pretty well.
[171:17.84]Oh, don't worry.
[171:18.30]He fooled on round two.
[171:20.46]It's alright.
[171:21.04]It's not that much damage, but... Belly punch, and he drops the guts.
[171:29.23]He may not have been ready for this, but it's alright.
[171:36.92]These don't use very much... These use very, very little guts, though.
[171:40.54]So they're easy to hit more than once or twice.
[171:42.04]Alright, now back it up.
[171:45.86]Don't do anything stupid.
[171:54.46]Oh, not good.
[171:55.55]Not good.
[171:56.05]I gotta hit him with something right now.
[171:58.31]There we go.
[172:04.09]Bash his head and do it again.
[172:08.54]Alright, see you later.
[172:13.26]Just a slugfest, it's alright.
[172:19.42]K.O.
[172:19.50]He's doing really well with this little loyalty.
[172:22.52]Because his moves are cheap.
[172:24.12]That's only 10 guts to do that move.
[172:26.12]And what, like 12 or 14 for the other one?
[172:34.23]Just have to worry about if that guy's a shitty guy.
[172:40.27]We're gonna have to play the attrition game again.
[172:43.45]Just dodge everybody.
[172:44.37]Stay back if there's somebody with moves that can't reach me, you know?
[172:51.52]I'm going against the little whale seal person.
[172:59.26]Lifesteal is an int-based attack.
[173:02.44]Cool, cool.
[173:06.67]He's got low defense, so this should be all right.
[173:09.22]Just stay in really, really close so he can't do an intelligence move.
[173:12.88]Just keep staying in and spam.
[173:14.30]There we go.
[173:21.76]Let's go for the claw.
[173:22.62]He doesn't want to get clawed.
[173:29.79]You just got screwed.
[173:30.47]That was 75% chance, dude.
[173:36.91]That hurt.
[173:39.11]No, no, no, no, no fooling around!
[173:42.96]Get in close.
[173:46.04]Get in close!
[173:48.08]Double!
[173:49.26]In a row, two... Oh my lord, come on man.
[173:53.52]Oh boy!
[173:55.08]That's like four in a row.
[173:56.36]Five in a row.
[173:58.66]Finally, holy shit.
[174:06.25]Take his... No, no, no.
[174:07.25]Don't take his gust down.
[174:07.83]Just make sure you don't get hit by anything else.
[174:09.07]Fine.
[174:10.63]Stay all the way back.
[174:11.21]Don't let him come.
[174:11.89]No worries.
[174:12.17]Yeah, that's it.
[174:13.09]Game over.
[174:25.35]Who did we combine to make Mr. Ice Cream?
[174:26.85]Tim Allen and... I forget.
[174:31.13]Louise?
[174:33.58]I don't even remember.
[174:34.30]Who the hell did we... Who did we combine for this?
[174:43.12]Once he gets another move, he has potential to be really, really good.
[174:49.70]Kira's still alive.
[175:00.09]Kira's good.
[175:02.50]That was Tim Allen and Ivanews, who used to be Louise.
[175:09.19]This can't be the successor to BB.
[175:11.13]Why not?
[175:11.73]This is going to be tough.
[175:14.17]At this point, actually, we need to get Lucky because he has better stats than almost everything.
[175:19.33]I'm going to have to hit him and run away.
[175:24.93]That's not hitting him and running away.
[175:28.21]Got Lucky on that one.
[175:35.48]Stay back.
[175:35.88]Remember, I can win by hitting him one time.
[175:45.03]Just back up.
[175:47.13]Even if you have to just stay the fuck away the whole time.
[175:51.23]That was really lucky.
[175:52.09]Stay back.
[175:53.50]Back it up!
[175:55.32]Good.
[175:56.70]Might just want to start spamming now.
[175:57.82]Spam.
[176:00.78]Come on.
[176:01.36]I have 96 guts.
[176:02.36]Just sit here and do it over and over again.
[176:09.91]Fine, stay back.
[176:11.07]You don't want to play that game.
[176:12.01]That's fine.
[176:15.34]That's not good.
[176:16.64]Thank you.
[176:17.78]Thank you for giving me the actual rolls this time.
[176:21.32]I win by percentage.
[176:22.22]Just stay back.
[176:26.48]What a strategy!
[176:37.54]Get up to E. We'll farm some E and D for a little while.
[176:45.23]By giving him that stat boost, you reduced his lifespan by 20 weeks.
[176:49.27]I'm not even joking.
[176:50.17]And that stat boost was for one battle.
[176:52.51]Do not give your monster drugs.
[176:54.25]They do very little and take away his lifespan.
[176:56.65]And chat, don't tell him to do dumb things.
[176:58.94]He is impressionable.
[177:00.58]What?! !
[177:25.38]It was for one fight?
[177:32.98]I'm really susceptible to peer pressure.
[177:34.92]I am, I care about what you people have to say.
[177:37.07]I care about what you guys have to say.
[177:39.17]I care about what everyone in this chat has to say.
[177:42.09]I don't wanna be some idiot that fucks up.
[177:43.95]I wanna make you happy.
[177:44.95]I just wanna make you happy.
[177:46.51]That was a big hit.
[177:54.28]We're having fun together!
[177:55.79]I care what you guys have to say.
[178:02.21]Okay, no more dicking around, because I... I can use... That's a 10, and they got the fucking 20.
[178:15.72]Bingo!
[178:18.41]No, but I do appreciate, honestly, let me be perfectly clear about this.
[178:23.83]Anybody that's giving me any help or tips or trying to help, I mean, it is an old game, and there's a lot of weird, obscure things that how the hell would you ever know unless you sat there and tried to find information on it?
[178:35.58]And even the information that's out there is not really, it's only like on forums and there's some like wiki pages that show things, but I do appreciate people trying to help, I do.
[178:46.29]You guys have given me a lot of good tips that I did not know before.
[178:49.78]So, thank you.
[178:50.28]I do appreciate it.
[178:51.50]All like the joking around and fucking around aside.
[178:53.32]I do.
[178:53.90]Thank you.
[178:54.20]Appreciate it.
[179:01.88]We dick around a lot, but, you know, for real.
[179:04.28]Thanks, guys.
[179:04.96]Appreciate that.
[179:06.16]I appreciate it.
[179:10.80]There's a huge full guide on literally everything.
[179:12.88]I don't get time to read.
[179:17.94]I only read one thing, and that's Garfield every Sunday.
[179:22.06]It's just at a seventh grade reading level for me to understand it.
[179:25.97]You know?
[179:35.73]And let's get a 5-0 here.
[179:39.24]When did I... I never said F-U Twitch chat.
[179:41.30]When did I say that?
[179:44.02]You guys are the bread and butter of this stream.
[179:50.78]I'll give me a Yahtzee here.
[179:52.66]There it is.
[179:55.34]There it is.
[179:56.20]Nice palm smack.
[180:01.34]Now, just stay back for a while.
[180:04.08]Nice dodge.
[180:04.74]Good work.
[180:07.32]By the way, your Ripper will live at least seven years.
[180:10.21]That's really good to know.
[180:12.61]That's pretty good to know.
[180:13.43]Thank you.
[180:15.37]That means we don't have to be concerned at three years.
[180:21.18]Give me that five hundo.
[180:22.18]Let's get him some new moves.
[180:23.08]I'm excited about this guy.
[180:24.16]I think there's a lot of potential here.
[180:28.40]Okay, that's enough.
[180:29.78]That's fucking funny.
[180:30.94]Thank you.
[180:33.96]Thank you.
[180:35.38]Quickly.
[180:36.42]Do another move quickly.
[180:37.35]Do it.
[180:39.11]You can't be serious.
[180:51.22]There's still one.
[180:56.45]God damn it.
[181:07.74]How quickly the tide turns.
[181:18.89]Wait, what are you guys, what the fuck are you guys talking about?
[181:32.32]Oh.
[181:34.00]Hey, sorry, hey, relax.
[181:35.58]Hey, hey, relax!
[181:49.38]Okay, I have to win this.
[181:51.72]Don't be stunlocked!
[181:53.22]Please.
[181:58.82]I'm gonna wait till I have, like, 40 guts.
[182:03.82]And pull it back.
[182:04.56]Only 10 damage for that?
[182:05.56]Not even worth doing it.
[182:14.90]Thank you for not... Good dodge.
[182:17.78]Hit him again, come on.
[182:20.66]He won't let me get close to him.
[182:22.36]This is not good.
[182:25.64]Hit it!
[182:27.48]Just be in close and get the sure thing.
[182:29.95]Can't get in close.
[182:31.19]I can't bridge the gap here.
[182:32.05]Come on.
[182:33.45]Good, good, good, good, good.
[182:34.73]There it is.
[182:41.19]Tournament 1.
[182:43.19]Moving on.
[182:48.35]DPS.
[182:52.57]Mr. Ice Cream is the winner.
[182:54.61]Thank you for participating.
[182:56.01]All of you other terrible monsters.
[183:01.30]Do the scream.
[183:02.92]Oh, really? 750.
[183:18.89]See, who doesn't like Mr. Ice Cream?
[183:22.13]He's pretty cool.
[183:30.90]There's no reason to not like Mr. Ice Cream.
[183:38.14]He got nine subs.
[183:39.24]I think he learned a new lesson.
[183:42.32]Good.
[183:44.89]And he needs more defense.
[183:47.44]He did a good job.
[183:48.74]We're not going to... Yes, we're going to praise him.
[183:50.60]I want loyalty.
[183:51.24]I don't care if he's soft.
[184:01.07]He's still a baby, right?
[184:01.99]Give him some milk.
[184:08.63]He's soft-served.
[184:17.75]Alright, uh, let's do... go to Training.
[184:23.29]Oh, so now that there's a lot of people here that, you know, most people are trickling in by now, this is the last Monster Rancher 2 stream that's gonna be for a little while.
[184:31.29]We might even just move on.
[184:32.93]In fact, you know, I'll do it now, because there's almost 3,000 people here, so let's get the sentiment now.
[184:42.72]More Monster Rancher 2, or next, just move on to Monster Rancher 3?
[184:47.68]And I'm not talking about next stream.
[184:49.06]I'm talking about, like, potentially a week or two from now.
[184:52.45]Because I have to get it.
[184:53.61]And that would be, I have to hook up the PlayStation 2 at that point.
[184:55.87]That's a whole other ordeal.
[184:58.21]So let's see what you guys want to do.
[185:00.32]And now, remember, this is not, hey, what do you want me to stream tomorrow?
[185:04.26]No, this is, do you want me to stay on 2 or go to 3 when we play it again?
[185:16.97]Pretty simple.
[185:18.86]Stay on two or go to three.
[185:20.96]Let's see.
[185:25.80]I'll let it run for a little bit.
[185:27.16]I'm going to keep it up pretty much the whole time.
[185:30.58]But now let's do some of these.
[185:32.86]I feel like we'll get some good stats here.
[185:44.39]Alright, we're gonna do a Scald here.
[185:45.46]Come on, that was... That's bullshit.
[185:50.00]Need to be a champion of the previous one first.
[185:52.58]I feel like we could probably do that tonight.
[186:00.59]I think we can.
[186:01.27]I really think we can at least get to A tonight.
[186:04.05]With either him or the next one.
[186:05.59]Because, I mean, I'm locked in here for the long haul, guys.
[186:11.17]Don't you want next-gen graphics here?
[186:20.57]Champion or delete my Twitch.
[186:22.95]That's old material.
[186:23.77]We made that joke before.
[186:27.03]Training.
[186:29.90]Drill.
[186:31.74]Power and life.
[186:32.78]Come on.
[186:33.48]I need defense as well.
[186:34.40]We're gonna do the defense.
[186:35.14]We're gonna do this one.
[186:35.90]He's cheating again.
[186:44.29]Can't do that shit, man.
[186:50.14]Only 600 votes so far.
[186:51.70]Oh, there's more than that.
[186:53.42]There's like 800 or 900 votes right now.
[187:05.31]It's harder than it seems, and you won't unlock really anything.
[187:08.05]Takes way too long.
[187:10.46]Alright, well, whatever.
[187:11.14]I mean, it looks like the sentiment is to go to three anyways, so...
[187:16.60]Can't you play Monster Ranch 2 on PS2?
[187:19.38]I guess yeah.
[187:21.58]Yeah, I do.
[187:22.25]Memory card will work too, right?
[187:29.89]Can you just give me some defense?
[187:31.71]So I was told that doing the combo ones is way more efficient.
[187:37.35]Failed it anyways.
[187:45.20]Give him the shoes!
[187:47.18]Alright, you get milk one more time and then that's it.
[187:49.14]You're not a baby anymore.
[187:56.66]Evil monsters get greater gains for cheating?
[188:00.48]Yeah, but you can't just let him do whatever the fuck he wants.
[188:08.28]Save it.
[188:11.04]That's not save, that's item.
[188:16.38]I got 10,000 gold.
[188:17.30]Man, we've been working it.
[188:22.48]Before Kuro went into the deep freeze, he made us like 11,000 gold.
[188:26.64]Alright, I'll be more lenient to him.
[188:33.04]When's the next deke?
[188:33.80]I'll get deke up here.
[188:34.64]I'm not ready for it.
[188:36.76]I want to learn a new move.
[188:38.25]Next time I can do Errantry, I'm going to try to get a new move.
[188:40.83]But I want to wait until it's cheap.
[188:41.85]We're holding on to this money.
[188:42.71]We are Scrooge McDucking this money, guys.
[188:49.00]Uh, let's do skill.
[188:50.10]Just pure skill.
[188:57.80]Oh, he's cheating again.
[188:58.94]Alright, he cheated.
[189:04.54]Scald him?
[189:05.22]No.
[189:06.42]He seems relieved.
[189:09.82]Oh, he thought it said 104k.
[189:10.52]Don't scald him.
[189:18.89]Let's try to get the skill to about 200.
[189:20.81]Mr. Ice Cream says, I want to play with you.
[189:22.65]All right, yes.
[189:25.43]What is the game you play with this guy?
[189:30.28]Hey, Jerma, how's it hanging?
[189:31.10]Hey, Pin.
[189:32.30]How's it hanging with you?
[189:32.90]Hope you're having a good day.
[189:40.92]His loyalty went way up.
[189:44.44]I made a promise.
[189:45.36]We can play.
[189:47.18]Do all the different monsters have different games you play with them?
[189:49.46]One of them wanted to play rock, paper, scissors.
[189:50.94]The other one wanted to throw rocks.
[189:52.04]What does this one want to do?
[189:53.10]A screaming contest?
[189:55.02]No, it's a rock throwing.
[189:58.60]Oh, let's go.
[190:08.91]Come on.
[190:10.99]You just made yourself a bigger target, man.
[190:16.25]He is a huge target.
[190:17.81]Just hit him right in the chest.
[190:26.19]And three.
[190:29.48]Oh, I am absolutely decimating you right now.
[190:31.78]Come on, you can do better than that.
[190:39.70]He looks like a ghost from Luigi's Mansion.
[190:49.44]That would have been a better name.
[190:51.44]What's a boss from Luigi's Mansion?
[190:57.90]Alright, we'll beat the spread.
[191:01.74]He hit me.
[191:03.24]Let him hit you.
[191:04.26]He's just a young baby.
[191:05.90]He's fine.
[191:08.21]It's boss baby. ...
[191:19.10]king boo does not look like king boo all right 27 loyalty I want it okay we got a d cup here it's four entrance two thousand I don't think he's not ready we need another move more power
[191:51.38]Plus five.
[191:52.26]Nice.
[191:52.72]Good, good, good.
[191:59.57]First week of March.
[192:00.51]Hey, this is where we are currently on Earth.
[192:03.51]All right.
[192:03.95]Milk again.
[192:04.43]This is the last time you get milk.
[192:07.65]Grow up.
[192:13.78]I spent way too much time playing this, and I only unlocked six monsters so far.
[192:18.38]And I could only do that by looking up things online.
[192:20.30]So many monsters to unlock a crazy cryptic, like I got a tree growing on my farm, that will create a monster in ten years.
[192:27.86]And I got the item for it after unlocking all the items in the item shop, and that's one of the easiest to unlock.
[192:36.09]Holy shit.
[192:39.83]Well, okay.
[192:41.07]There you go.
[192:44.39]Alright, we're gonna do Errantry.
[192:45.55]Let's do Power.
[192:48.75]See if we can get a good move.
[192:52.35]Seems well.
[192:52.81]I'm gonna... Let's de-stress him a little bit here.
[192:56.21]Did I buy one?
[192:57.47]That's Fatigue, Star Prune, Disc Chips, Flower.
[193:01.96]Let's buy him some... Let's buy him one of those first.
[193:10.68]Shoes denied!
[193:18.47]Maybe I'll do skill first.
[193:27.21]Skill sounds like a good idea.
[193:30.26]This is no joke one of the most cryptic games I've ever seen.
[193:33.86]Maybe that's why it has such a large cult following.
[193:42.94]He didn't have shoes.
[193:43.92]He's a slug, guys.
[193:45.02]He can't wear shoes.
[193:51.48]Let's do it.
[193:51.98]Errantry.
[193:56.50]$1,000.
[193:56.86]I wonder if we should do skill or power.
[194:09.91]Shoes are for chewing.
[194:11.07]I'm gonna say... I would say skill for the early game, but maybe power.
[194:24.27]I'll do power.
[194:26.55]It's a chance to get a technique.
[194:28.37]Let's go against the plate, doesn't matter.
[194:32.21]We can skip this, we've already seen it a thousand times.
[194:37.45]And... Twister.
[194:40.56]Success!
[194:43.20]No new technique yet.
[194:46.62]And... Sleeping Camel!
[194:49.14]Oh... Fail!
[194:54.01]And Slip the Camel.
[194:57.97]Success!
[195:00.78]Give me a new technique.
[195:01.46]Come on.
[195:02.16]Make it worth it.
[195:09.42]Fuck.
[195:10.38]Well, that was a waste of time.
[195:12.32]Good thing that wasn't more than $1,000.
[195:13.30]You can do better than that.
[195:19.22]Come on, man.
[195:21.66]You really could have done better than that.
[195:25.83]What's wrong with him?
[195:27.07]Jeremy, Mr. Ice Cream is sick.
[195:28.61]It's not serious, but he'll be in the hospital.
[195:30.49]How did he get sick?
[195:34.47]What did he do?
[195:35.09]He's just burping.
[195:44.65]It was just a little gas.
[195:45.81]Not a lot of gas.
[195:53.50]Let it out.
[195:53.98]It's alright.
[195:56.18]Good.
[195:57.64]Yeah, see, he's fine.
[195:59.30]He had a little bit of indigestion.
[196:00.66]He got into the trash.
[196:05.32]Zero fucking loyalty.
[196:06.82]Why?
[196:08.47]I didn't do anything.
[196:16.71]Give me another Errantry.
[196:17.59]No.
[196:22.79]I'll buy some shit, though.
[196:26.82]We're even.
[196:29.50]Let's get a couple of mint leaves.
[196:31.52]Let's get some candy.
[196:37.05]He's gonna hate me now.
[196:39.55]That's alright.
[196:41.85]Tasty snack.
[196:43.09]Get a couple of mangoes.
[196:44.29]Get some more mint leaves.
[196:52.47]He's not overweight.
[196:53.47]We don't need sweet jelly.
[196:55.53]We already have some of that.
[196:56.55]We already have one of these.
[196:57.23]Maybe I'll just... I wonder if I give that to him.
[196:59.97]How bad that would be.
[197:00.67]Because I have a star prune now.
[197:16.87]True loyalty.
[197:18.05]That sucks.
[197:20.13]Curses fame and spoils the monster.
[197:21.67]Maybe I should just do it.
[197:22.49]Should I just spoil him for a minute?
[197:28.74]Just to get him some fans?
[197:31.80]Give to a monster with no loyalty.
[197:36.54]Where is your loyalty?
[197:37.92]Now we're going to start doing these.
[197:43.56]Let's go.
[197:44.06]Is there a skill one for these?
[197:45.16]No.
[197:47.44]Come on.
[197:47.84]Give me a big power boost here.
[197:51.83]Is he cheating?
[197:52.53]That's fine.
[197:53.11]Don't scold him.
[197:53.75]No.
[197:54.13]Alright.
[198:01.63]It's time for food.
[198:08.44]Let's give him some actual food now.
[198:09.64]Let's give him a fish.
[198:11.76]I need to make some money.
[198:12.42]We gotta do a cup now.
[198:17.38]I wonder if I should just spend the money right now and just go back and do more errantry.
[198:31.32]Stressed out again.
[198:32.08]Yeah, eat like a fucking... No.
[198:37.12]Go to sleep.
[198:41.37]Scolding increases his loyalty.
[198:42.93]I thought it was the other way around, if he cheated.
[198:46.49]Alright, I'm gonna put the shoes on.
[198:56.97]Use.
[198:58.08]Shoes.
[199:00.68]Are you sure?
[199:01.22]Put on those shoes!
[199:04.42]There you go.
[199:14.56]Hope you liked it.
[199:17.97]What do we got for data?
[199:21.87]Let's see.
[199:25.22]176, 161.
[199:26.08]He needs defense and life.
[199:32.07]What do I get?
[199:33.63]Let's do swim.
[199:41.87]Level 3, that's good.
[199:45.73]Seems well.
[199:46.63]Do it again.
[199:49.31]Swim again.
[199:50.25]Who cares about intelligence right now?
[199:53.45]I want to participate in an attorney and fight next week.
[199:57.33]Yes, you can.
[199:59.11]Hey, he likes fighting.
[200:01.68]Good.
[200:14.55]You know, people say the might of the house is the might of the trainer.
[200:17.96]Our house is getting too small for us now.
[200:20.36]We have money, so it'll cost 5,000 gold to renovate the house.
[200:26.56]What would you want?
[200:27.12]You want to renovate the house.
[200:33.59]That's a lot of money.
[200:36.65]Do it.
[200:37.77]Then I will ask the carpenter.
[200:40.55]Jeremy.
[200:41.58]This is Binto, the carpenter.
[200:44.23]He's the number one carpenter around here.
[200:47.15]Stop it.
[200:48.03]Although our motto is fast, cheap, and derailed, you will not be disappointed.
[200:53.70]I'll be looking forward to seeing your job.
[200:57.22]Oh, but we cannot concentrate when a stranger comes into our sight.
[201:00.30]I have to ask you to visit somewhere while we're working.
[201:03.06]When we finish our job, I'll come and fucking find you.
[201:06.42]Got it.
[201:07.50]I have to stay at the Pabst house, so don't worry.
[201:11.80]Leave it to me.
[201:15.60]He said the wrong word.
[201:16.64]Yeah, I know.
[201:17.96]How about that?
[201:19.48]Pretty neat, huh?
[201:21.78]You're done already.
[201:22.60]I told you our motor was fast, cheap, and fucking awful.
[201:27.01]I'll take the money.
[201:28.04]Ask us anytime.
[201:30.94]I don't know what to say.
[201:31.70]It is a good house.
[201:32.52]I guess that takes care of all of it, huh?
[201:35.56]Jeremy, didn't you make a promise that you'll enter Deterney?
[201:38.04]I hope you'll consider that.
[201:45.28]Gemini Cup.
[201:46.18]We'll try it.
[201:50.07]Uh, so... I have to.
[201:54.01]I told him I would.
[201:56.64]So now, how do I get the new monsters?
[201:59.68]I just did a $5,000 house renovation.
[202:02.84]Do they just appear now, or do I have to find them somewhere?
[202:10.77]New houses, new monsters.
[202:12.65]Where do I get them?
[202:22.30]keep ice cream in.
[202:23.81]Is it the CDs I couldn't use?
[202:25.07]We need the barn upgrade as well.
[202:32.81]Let's try to get a win here.
[202:33.91]It's going to be difficult, but we can try.
[202:35.34]I'm going to file for bankruptcy.
[202:42.62]They're the rare ones from CDs.
[202:47.99]If I land a couple of hits, this should be fine.
[202:54.49]Just go for a bang.
[202:57.11]He blocked it.
[202:59.69]That just made him angry.
[203:01.95]He just got kissed and it pissed him off.
[203:06.48]Don't get... Don't get too angry because you need to do... I forgot.
[203:09.40]You can't even hurt me.
[203:11.48]That's fine.
[203:11.90]Just do another whack.
[203:21.20]Stay... the kiss doesn't do really much.
[203:23.38]It just takes your guts down.
[203:26.42]But you can only take my guts down so far before you don't do anything.
[203:30.92]You only do like three damage anyway, so... Not that concerned about it.
[203:40.55]Though I am missing everything.
[203:46.67]Skill is definitely on the table.
[204:02.24]Actually, we should win this without very much of a problem, I don't think.
[204:05.72]It wouldn't be that much of an issue.
[204:07.30]Remember that time I lost Monster Rancher because I couldn't pay my mortgage.
[204:20.52]Twitch scammer?
[204:21.50]Why am I a Twitch scammer?
[204:25.85]Uh, 176 power.
[204:27.09]His defense is... Uh, this might... This might not go so well.
[204:32.40]I just have to zone him.
[204:34.62]I gotta get a hit, and then we have to zone.
[204:41.89]Stay back.
[204:43.87]There it is.
[204:44.21]Alright.
[204:44.63]Now just play it smart.
[204:48.45]That's not smart.
[204:52.43]Stop losing focus here.
[204:58.17]Let's back it up.
[204:59.31]I need a big hit.
[205:02.49]Fuck.
[205:02.97]Thank God you dodged that.
[205:03.99]That would have been the end of the whole thing.
[205:05.29]Alright, I got a lot of guts.
[205:06.99]Use it.
[205:07.25]You're not making this easy.
[205:11.17]Come on.
[205:12.07]Hit something.
[205:13.49]Please.
[205:16.45]Again.
[205:18.57]Stop getting so confused.
[205:24.76]Get in closer!
[205:28.36]Get in close!
[205:28.96]Get in close!
[205:29.40]Get in close!
[205:29.74]Get in close!
[205:31.06]There it is!
[205:32.20]Perfect.
[205:32.90]Good job.
[205:42.17]I like how he prays every time he fucks up.
[205:44.01]That was probably the hardest one.
[205:49.65]I think Harry Ma has really low health, which is exactly what we want to face against.
[206:01.39]Let's see... Yes.
[206:03.01]Have to win this.
[206:05.71]We have to win one of the next two.
[206:07.03]It's against the same guy.
[206:12.71]Yeah, terrible defense.
[206:15.89]Just need to land some hits and we'll be fine.
[206:18.95]He only has two moves as well.
[206:20.29]Just zone him out.
[206:21.35]Try to get a hit and then run away.
[206:24.23]That's not good.
[206:25.81]But that is.
[206:28.65]Dodge it.
[206:29.29]It's okay, you do more damage than him.
[206:37.46]Ooh, double foolery.
[206:38.62]That's good.
[206:39.14]That we just worked out.
[206:40.98]That was a huge lucky roll there.
[206:43.16]We both fooled.
[206:45.81]Now I get the roll.
[206:46.73]Sick.
[206:47.49]Alright, you gotta be faster than him here.
[206:52.41]Come on, get it.
[206:58.21]Trying to zone me.
[206:59.01]Get in.
[207:00.79]Whack him again!
[207:01.39]Nice.
[207:06.21]This tournament is officially... ...over.
[207:18.72]Mr. Ice Cream's pretty... yeah, he's legit.
[207:23.04]He just needs a new skill, and he needs some more power.
[207:29.29]We've got some item here.
[207:30.15]What the hell is this item?
[207:39.84]It needs a new name.
[207:45.22]I wish I could change it.
[207:51.71]Losing to Millium.
[207:59.31]Big money.
[207:59.83]2100.
[207:59.85]Good.
[208:00.15]That's going right to Erendria.
[208:03.09]And then Gemini's Pot.
[208:09.34]Climbing up in the fame ranks.
[208:17.44]Oh, tell us about the bathrobe.
[208:18.90]All right, I'll go over the bathrobe story for now because, I mean, we got a minute here.
[208:24.43]Let me go get it.
[208:25.73]Let me go get the bathrobe.
[208:27.43]I'll be right back.
[208:29.49]Just give me, literally give me two seconds.
[208:31.35]I'm going to go get it so I can show you what I'm talking about.
[208:35.90]That's pretty good stat increases.
[208:37.02]I'm happy with it.
[208:38.74]I think Mr. Ice Cream did a great job.
[208:40.50]Praise him.
[208:42.80]No.
[208:45.44]We're too soft.
[208:48.83]Time to be strict.
[208:49.49]At least for a little while.
[208:57.00]Fish.
[209:01.54]Eat well.
[209:06.92]No, I didn't shit in a row.
[209:12.80]Let him go to sleep.
[209:13.60]All right.
[209:13.98]Let me... Hold on.
[209:14.56]Let him go to... Let's rest.
[209:15.72]Let me go get the bathrobe so I can demonstrate what happened.
[209:19.46]Give me one sec.
[209:22.37]I'm not going to put it on the VRV screen.
[209:23.83]I'm just going to go get it.
[209:26.01]I'm not going to mute the mic either.
[209:27.57]What do I have to hide?
[210:26.54]I'm not sure if this is the right way to do it, but I'll try.
[211:35.40]See, I got nothing to fucking hide.
[211:38.90]Alright, so anyways, look at this.
[211:41.51]So we'll do a demonstration.
[211:46.53]I'm in new clothes!
[211:52.79]So let's get this bigger.
[212:07.17]Put this down.
[212:11.37]Okay, so look.
[212:12.35]Ready?
[212:12.57]Can you see?
[212:14.93]I'm not wearing a shit-covered robe.
[212:22.89]There's more to the story.
[212:28.03]Alright, look.
[212:28.75]So.
[212:30.73]The frame rate is fucking awful, but I had to do it.
[212:35.60]So take a look.
[212:36.12]So I got... I have this robe, right?
[212:38.58]I wasn't feeling that well yesterday.
[212:39.97]I was pretty sick.
[212:42.07]I've been feeling like shit the last few days.
[212:44.17]So this is a very long robe.
[212:46.29]You see how long this is?
[212:47.41]It's like a double dress.
[212:48.87]It's huge.
[212:50.32]So this is the toilet right here, right?
[212:51.86]What you're looking at right now, this is the can, right?
[212:54.10]This is the fucking can, is what I'm talking about.
[212:56.54]So I went into the bathroom.
[212:57.72]I was cold and sick.
[212:59.66]And I had this idea.
[213:00.48]I don't want to take my bathrobe off.
[213:02.27]It's too cold in the house.
[213:03.67]So fuck, man.
[213:04.31]I'm like, oh, I don't feel well going into the bathroom.
[213:07.15]And I did this.
[213:09.03]Figured this was a good idea, right?
[213:10.29]Like just stuff it up underneath my armpits, right?
[213:13.58]So like, I'm good.
[213:14.82]This is going all the way down to my feet, but I'm good, right?
[213:17.64]Let's get on that camp.
[213:19.50]Stuffed under the armpits.
[213:20.82]Take a look.
[213:23.17]We're fine.
[213:24.17]Everything's completely and totally fine.
[213:26.17]There's nothing wrong at all.
[213:28.60]Finished my business.
[213:30.72]Time to do something else, right?
[213:32.18]What's part two?
[213:36.14]How do I do this?
[213:36.78]Because right now I'm clenching with my elbows the robe.
[213:42.24]so if you look at what happens when you start there it goes into the toilet I have to hold like this go around here this one starts to fall and I swear to god it took me like it took me like 30 minutes to do part two of going to the bathroom and then when I was like when I was done I noticed that I had a little bit of wet spot on that robe on the corner
[214:06.84]You know what I mean?
[214:07.40]Like, it took me probably 20 or 30 minutes to go to the bathroom.
[214:10.79]Like, after that.
[214:11.99]How do you do that?
[214:14.23]I didn't shit in my robe.
[214:15.43]I said I had to.
[214:16.21]I said I was shitting in the robe.
[214:18.39]Like, I was inside the robe.
[214:22.01]Look at how long this is.
[214:22.85]Ready?
[214:23.77]Check that technique out.
[214:26.83]This is huge.
[214:28.67]Goes all the way down.
[214:32.68]Now that it's on, though...
[214:41.33]Damn it, I didn't get it.
[214:50.58]Why wear it on the toilet?
[214:51.58]Because I was very uncomfortable!
[214:55.38]I was super cold, really uncomfortable, and it was a terrible idea.
[215:01.66]Did I wash it?
[215:02.58]No!
[215:03.35]Yes, I did.
[215:03.63]That's a lie.
[215:05.97]Fuck.
[215:07.07]I got nothing to hide.
[215:08.71]Oh, no, I do.
[215:10.05]I shit in my robe and dump it in the toilet.
[215:17.25]Okay, there you go.
[215:17.79]There's the story of why you should never go to the bathroom with a robe on.
[215:25.31]Okay.
[215:27.13]I didn't even get a drink either.
[215:28.49]Ah, what a dumb fucking dumb idiot.
[215:32.06]Okay, he's even.
[215:37.34]Flush the robe.
[215:42.79]Why waste time?
[215:43.67]Just wash it in the toilet.
[215:49.69]That's a grandpa.
[215:50.59]It is a grandpa robe.
[215:51.67]It is an old man robe.
[215:52.95]It is.
[215:53.29]I know.
[215:53.55]I've accepted this.
[215:55.50]Errantry.
[215:57.68]Let's do skill.
[216:03.59]Skill and life.
[216:07.95]Should we do power again?
[216:09.31]No, do skill.
[216:10.09]I need more percentage.
[216:15.05]Bingo.
[216:22.19]Weird on the front.
[216:25.23]If I had known that.
[216:31.46]And success!
[216:32.18]Good.
[216:33.65]Plus 10.
[216:33.89]There we go.
[216:34.35]This is what I'm talking about.
[216:35.23]Get this over 200.
[216:39.21]Small raft.
[216:40.47]Jump.
[216:42.11]And is it successful?
[216:43.13]Got it.
[216:54.08]New tech.
[216:54.68]Finally.
[216:55.80]New move.
[216:56.36]New technique.
[217:00.25]Hungry Shaxx.
[217:03.13]And... Success!
[217:09.55]Time for the gigantic crab.
[217:12.28]And... Faked him out.
[217:17.34]Pretending to be dead.
[217:17.96]That's a new skill.
[217:19.32]Feign death.
[217:23.62]I failed.
[217:23.98]It's okay.
[217:25.23]I got a new technique.
[217:31.25]He acquired a new technique.
[217:32.37]It seems pretty strong.
[217:33.54]Praise him!
[217:34.66]Sure.
[217:36.58]Please him.
[217:37.66]Make sure we please him.
[217:40.84]Oh, Mr. Ice Cream seems very tired.
[217:45.02]What is the new move?
[217:50.64]Belly punch, thwack, and stab.
[217:52.66]So when his D force D hit...
[218:02.30]I mean, I would be using this every time.
[218:06.56]This is just better in every conceivable way.
[218:08.24]I mean, 10... I would just use this.
[218:11.92]No, I actually won't use either one of these ever again.
[218:16.55]Funnily enough.
[218:17.65]These are both D and D. But this one has A with E and E for sharpness.
[218:23.87]So, I mean, this is the only move I'm going to use.
[218:28.55]Only going to stab until we get another move, because what's the point?
[218:32.96]14 versus 10.
[218:34.28]This one's pretty much a guaranteed hit.
[218:35.72]Ah, excuse me.
[218:36.78]No.
[218:40.38]Take a sleep.
[218:46.93]D&D stream confirmed?
[218:48.65]What do you mean, D&D stream?
[218:50.75]What are you talking about?
[218:53.96]What are you talking about?
[218:57.02]Next tournament is right here.
[218:58.74]Desert Moon Cup.
[219:00.81]We will enter it.
[219:01.81]Now let me take a look at that card.
[219:04.87]Speed is terrible.
[219:07.63]Life, speed, he needs everything.
[219:09.55]We need to do some speed and defense.
[219:10.79]I'm gonna do another... Yeah, another air entry for speed.
[219:14.90]What do you think?
[219:16.00]Somebody tell me.
[219:16.48]Hmm?
[219:17.84]Should I just wait?
[219:21.02]Just train it normally?
[219:23.83]What do you think?
[219:24.47]Speed and int?
[219:25.43]Lose a little speed?
[219:26.65]Yeah.
[219:28.72]I could do it.
[219:31.36]Or could I, should I just do the, just dodge and try to level it up this way?
[219:34.04]Save some money, wait for sale.
[219:35.94]Yeah, we'll just do it this way.
[219:41.55]The chat lied again on the house upgrade.
[219:46.41]Increases his inventory space.
[219:53.53]Chat lied on the house upgrade.
[219:55.01]It just increases my inventory space.
[220:00.02]Oh, I wish I had that $5,000.
[220:00.96]All right, I think we're getting into like adolescence here where I can start training.
[220:22.28]The barn is the monster upgrade.
[220:27.43]No scolding.
[220:29.65]I'm going to give him this bunk.
[220:37.72]Let's go with fish again.
[220:43.62]Is this a church?
[220:45.44]Is that a cross?
[220:48.24]It is.
[220:50.58]I didn't know this was the House of God.
[220:51.98]Apparently it is.
[220:55.92]Alright, here we go.
[220:56.95]Good thing I stopped.
[220:57.71]Good thing I didn't do it, because this is probably it.
[221:01.19]Yeah, it is.
[221:01.61]Thank God.
[221:02.03]Alright, shot.
[221:02.47]What do you think?
[221:03.03]Speed or skill?
[221:08.47]Speed or skill?
[221:09.20]What do you think?
[221:16.86]Skill?
[221:21.04]I don't know.
[221:21.48]I feel like we just gotta move from skill though.
[221:26.66]Let's do a pull.
[221:28.69]See what you guys have to say.
[221:33.95]We'll chat this side on this dude.
[221:37.75]This is power, skill, or speed.
[221:45.65]This is just Twitch plays leveling up the monster, you know?
[221:57.35]Right here.
[221:57.63]Looks like it's between power and speed.
[222:10.53]Let's let him rest for today.
[222:17.69]Power and speed.
[222:20.43]Stronger, not faster.
[222:22.92]Show the stats again?
[222:23.98]Absolutely.
[222:30.54]There is no training for defense right now.
[222:33.50]So, if you're curious.
[222:38.40]I could get to 200 skill on my own by doing the level up.
[222:41.20]Just like a drill.
[222:43.49]But, power and life... I can see speed is pretty bad right now.
[222:49.81]I would do any of them.
[222:51.87]I would do either one.
[222:59.21]Speed.
[222:59.57]He's going to die.
[223:02.81]Well, that's going to close in five seconds.
[223:09.27]Five, four, three, two, one.
[223:10.77]Thank you for voting.
[223:11.53]We're doing power.
[223:17.26]Have you seen the notice?
[223:24.26]A thousand gold.
[223:25.18]Choose quickly.
[223:25.92]Power.
[223:30.41]Three, two, one... Wait, what did it say?
[223:33.39]Did it say it was a chance?
[223:34.71]I missed it.
[223:36.99]It seems that there is some chance to get that.
[223:39.63]Power.
[223:46.72]Where's my concern for standard voting procedure?
[223:48.82]What do you mean?
[223:52.52]Good.
[223:53.90]New tech!
[223:56.56]Can't wait to see what it is.
[224:01.40]Run into that camel.
[224:03.69]Good.
[224:05.39]Beautiful.
[224:10.25]Drain the oasis.
[224:16.14]Why do you have such trouble doing this?
[224:17.52]Come on.
[224:24.62]Why can you not do this one?
[224:29.75]Oh, well.
[224:31.43]That was a success.
[224:32.97]I can't say the word.
[224:33.69]That was a success, apparently.
[224:36.35]Seems pretty strong.
[224:39.35]Should I praise him here?
[224:40.10]What do you think?
[224:45.10]I feel like I shouldn't.
[224:52.30]I don't think so.
[225:00.82]Yeah.
[225:02.18]Nah, he looks tired.
[225:04.13]Give him some rest.
[225:06.73]What's the new move?
[225:11.77]Belly Punch and Tail Assault.
[225:15.52]Hits harder.
[225:22.54]Okay.
[225:23.20]Yeah, I think it just directly replaced both of these moves.
[225:33.05]It's got a C for force.
[225:35.09]D for hit.
[225:36.03]It has a slight crit chance.
[225:39.28]Man, it drains.
[225:39.88]Yeah, I think we're just gonna... We'll just be smart about where we hit.
[225:43.96]Because this is pretty much a guaranteed hit.
[225:45.66]And this is not a guaranteed hit.
[225:48.08]But it does more damage than this.
[225:50.40]It's only five more.
[225:51.88]Another thousand gold down the toilet.
[225:56.36]No, what are you talking about?
[225:57.34]It's not a thousand gold down the toilet.
[226:04.83]It's like we learned a new move.
[226:07.70]Look, we got a battle coming up here.
[226:09.30]Is this official?
[226:10.82]No, I ain't doing this one.
[226:14.10]No official tournament right now.
[226:18.12]We got another month of training and then we're gonna do the, we're gonna do the Gallo Cup.
[226:22.78]We're staying on D for a little while.
[226:29.27]You know what, here, look.
[226:30.27]We're gonna drill, we're gonna get skill to 200.
[226:35.90]I think actually now is a good time for me to start doing the double.
[226:38.48]Yeah, I'm gonna start doing the double up.
[226:46.74]Yeah.
[226:48.28]I'm at the point where I'm getting a lot of, uh... A lot of points per drill.
[226:55.80]Seems well-training.
[226:58.68]Drill again.
[227:01.04]We'll do power and life drop speed, but...
[227:08.78]Okay, just do it.
[227:12.63]I want to participate in a tourney and fight next week.
[227:20.83]Do you grant... No, because the next tournament is the one that he's not going to win.
[227:25.96]You can't hear the game audio.
[227:27.56]That's not true.
[227:32.26]I don't want him to participate in a tournament next week, because that's the one that's not... I'm not going to be able to win it.
[227:40.04]I know he likes fighting, but he's gonna lose.
[227:45.68]We want blood.
[227:46.60]Take him there.
[227:52.99]I'm underestimating his power.
[227:54.49]Do it.
[227:55.15]Do it.
[227:55.45]Fine.
[227:57.23]Let's do it.
[227:59.99]Sure.
[228:00.41]Let's go get our ass kicked.
[228:04.69]Is that gonna do it?
[228:05.85]No.
[228:06.22]Of course you can't.
[228:06.82]You can't fucking run up a mountain.
[228:12.64]Give me a break.
[228:13.40]Like, what the hell, man?
[228:14.74]I just promised you a tournament.
[228:22.14]Animal foods.
[228:24.26]Common principle foods.
[228:25.54]Hospital time!
[228:38.86]He'll learn even if he loses.
[228:40.26]Jeremy, today is the birthday of Mr. Ice Cream.
[228:46.11]Here we go.
[228:46.69]Everybody say it.
[228:48.11]Happy birthday to you, Mr. Ice Cream, and cake for you.
[228:56.59]Throw in via strong monster.
[229:06.00]Feels birthday, man.
[229:10.58]Did you like that?
[229:12.56]Good!
[229:14.66]Now, I shall give you a present.
[229:18.37]It's a meat cake!
[229:23.57]Mmm!
[229:27.47]Keep up the good work.
[229:29.61]Mr. Ice Cream is stressed out.
[229:30.91]We have to take care of it.
[229:32.31]Oh, wait a minute.
[229:32.91]Jeremy, didn't you make a promise that you'll enter it in the tourney?
[229:35.58]He's not ready!
[229:38.48]He's so tired!
[229:43.27]What tourney?
[229:43.83]There's no tourney.
[229:44.64]Oh, they're talking about this.
[229:48.84]Um, I could try this.
[229:50.78]I think I'm gonna get beat though.
[229:52.38]I think I'll do this one.
[229:55.32]Should we see?
[229:55.86]Let's give him mint tea.
[230:00.48]Give it a C.
[230:16.47]All right, rest up.
[230:22.79]See you, coward.
[230:26.51]No, I- I- yeah, I'm not- What the fuck happened to his loyalty?
[230:31.52]What happened?
[230:34.36]What did I do wrong?
[230:36.16]He was a 36 and I said, you can go to bed, have a good rest, and he woke up and started to fucking hate my guts.
[230:42.71]Why?
[230:46.04]Why?
[230:46.68]Why does he not like me?
[230:47.84]What did I do?
[230:49.78]I didn't do anything wrong.
[230:52.00]He wanted to fight.
[230:53.10]There was no tournament!
[230:57.72]What tournament was here?
[230:58.88]Oh, you promised what?
[231:01.50]Did you want to fight me behind the fucking shed?
[231:03.72]You want me to put on boxing gloves and beat your ass?
[231:10.52]I promised.
[231:12.16]You wanted to go toe-to-toe with me.
[231:20.54]Give me a break.
[231:21.96]Well, I figured it was because... You promised!
[231:29.81]What was I supposed to do?
[231:33.69]Let's go.
[231:34.53]Let's go.
[231:35.15]Let's fight.
[231:36.51]Even with shitty... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[231:39.02]Back out.
[231:39.32]How do I back out?
[231:40.58]Oh, no.
[231:41.30]Okay, I'm gonna lose this on purpose.
[231:42.70]I'm backing out of this.
[231:46.50]No, no, this is not official.
[231:47.66]This is fine.
[231:52.70]This is the mayonnaise cup.
[231:53.66]It's okay.
[231:54.32]This is the coffee mayonnaise cup.
[232:01.33]We can try it.
[232:01.87]No, there is no save, Scum, because I didn't save before that.
[232:08.58]The only one that's going to cause this problem here is Waranmo.
[232:13.62]Everybody else, we can just do this.
[232:14.82]We're only going to do stabbing.
[232:16.42]That's it.
[232:21.42]How do I not understand loyalty after four monsters in the game?
[232:25.18]I mean, I understand loyalty.
[232:26.68]I just don't... I didn't... Look.
[232:29.74]I didn't know that... Okay, when you promise... Oh, he wants to fight next week.
[232:33.90]I thought the game just... I thought the game just already knew that there was a tournament that week.
[232:38.40]And I was like, oh yeah, we'll fight on that tournament that you want to fight in.
[232:42.58]I didn't know that promising him that meant that there's no tournament tomorrow.
[232:47.67]Because every single time that we've had to do that, there's been a tournament the next day.
[232:55.06]Alright, let's go.
[232:55.56]We're going for... Nice dodge, good.
[232:59.36]We're going for a stab.
[233:03.31]Alright.
[233:08.07]There it is.
[233:09.39]Oh boy, that's good.
[233:10.39]That works for me.
[233:12.23]Keep it up.
[233:12.73]Do it again.
[233:13.39]No, let's try the tail assault.
[233:18.63]It's a nice try.
[233:21.07]Nice attempt.
[233:24.11]Good work.
[233:27.14]Now is the time to do it.
[233:28.34]Oh, man.
[233:33.66]Well, now we have to hit something.
[233:38.46]That was a lucky, lucky thing that happened there.
[233:42.22]Come on, do it again.
[233:43.30]Come on.
[233:44.82]No, shit.
[233:45.99]God damn it.
[233:54.74]We would've won that too, if... 60% of everything I did, he just didn't get confused.
[234:08.40]He must've fightin' a tournament.
[234:10.24]Oh, well, I'm your fucking assistant, and apparently I don't even know the schedule.
[234:15.28]Should he fight in a tournament next week?
[234:18.16]Yeah, he should.
[234:19.34]You're the one that's supposed to be bookkeeping all this shit.
[234:21.82]Oh, sorry, I didn't know there was even a tournament tomorrow.
[234:26.34]What good are you?
[234:32.97]This is why I denominate things to my assistant.
[234:34.71]What else would she be here for?
[234:36.57]She's my assistant.
[234:37.33]She helps me with this stuff.
[234:39.61]I'm going to lose to this guy, too.
[234:46.26]Wait, wait, no.
[234:46.92]This guy sucks.
[234:47.58]Just do the banana.
[234:48.72]I remember the technique on this guy.
[234:49.94]He only eats banana.
[234:52.26]Just hit him one time and then avoid him and only make him eat bananas.
[234:57.41]There it is.
[234:58.33]Get the fuck away.
[234:59.27]That's alright, that move sucks.
[235:04.80]Just, like, don't stand and get hit by it every time.
[235:08.62]I have to hit him again.
[235:16.80]I think I gotta hit him again with something.
[235:20.91]Uh, belly punch is a higher percentage, right?
[235:29.67]Back up, back up, back up, back up.
[235:30.99]Eat a banana.
[235:32.23]Get him to eat a banana.
[235:34.73]Have him waste moves.
[235:35.43]Okay, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[235:37.37]Now he has absolutely nothing.
[235:40.27]He can't do shit.
[235:40.90]There we go.
[235:49.34]There's a win.
[235:55.23]Stab is the highest percent, but I didn't want to get that close, because if he thwacked me, that would have been a huge problem.
[236:04.81]Imagine if the heal worked.
[236:06.02]Yeah, well, I gotta take the chances on that one, because we've seen that happen zero times.
[236:14.48]Waranmo has tried that move over the course of, like, 16 hours of playing this game, and it has not worked once.
[236:24.73]Alright, we're fine.
[236:26.41]Just have to win this one too.
[236:30.21]Looking forward to cigarette man kicking your ass.
[236:38.45]Intelligence is awful.
[236:41.53]This is a... This is a straight mirror.
[236:45.75]Alright, hold on.
[236:46.53]Wait a minute.
[236:46.87]What is going on with the profile picture?
[236:48.99]I'm just noticing this.
[236:52.67]What is this?
[236:55.14]I can't believe I didn't notice this the whole time.
[236:57.52]What is he lying?
[236:59.00]Is that a lounge chair?
[237:00.10]Look at this.
[237:03.87]What a magic trick that was.
[237:06.17]Is he going like this?
[237:07.97]Or is my mind deceiving me?
[237:10.87]Like this.
[237:16.67]Like that?
[237:19.72]Why?
[237:23.69]Well, time to lose.
[237:24.33]It's a straight up mirror match and he has better stats.
[237:27.35]So, just have to get lucky.
[237:29.49]AKA spam stab and only that and just hope that you actually don't get hit by anything.
[237:41.28]Come on, keep it up.
[237:42.42]Do it again.
[237:42.96]Come on, do it again.
[237:43.76]Alright, got advantage.
[237:46.07]Back it up now.
[237:46.61]Just run away.
[237:52.13]If he gets in too close, try to just do it again.
[237:57.77]It's not what I wanted.
[237:58.53]It's okay.
[237:59.03]He didn't do anything either.
[238:01.97]Stay back.
[238:02.57]He's closing the gap.
[238:08.18]Ow.
[238:10.42]Come on.
[238:12.02]No.
[238:12.70]Don't you dare.
[238:13.34]Come on.
[238:13.62]Hit it again.
[238:15.69]What did we just do?
[238:16.37]We were just in a mirror.
[238:17.83]Stab him.
[238:20.35]Back up.
[238:20.69]Back up!
[238:23.26]Back up. Back up. Back up. Back back back back-
[238:26.80]Fucking goddamnit that's so irritating.
[238:35.80]I would've had it too. Oh god that's so painful.
[238:40.80]I was spamming triangle.
[238:50.95]Holding down left doesn't do anything sometimes.
[238:52.93]And spamming triangle, it didn't work.
[238:54.65]Couldn't get it.
[238:55.75]Whatever.
[238:59.93]This all boils down to that stupid fucking... ...assistant bullshit.
[239:05.62]He wants me in a tournament!
[239:07.16]You promise?
[239:08.04]I don't know, lady!
[239:11.16]You tell me!
[239:11.76]I'm working here!
[239:28.29]He lost a bunch of fame too.
[239:38.87]Sore loser.
[239:40.43]No, that just never happened.
[239:42.07]I lost like 50% of my loyalty on a technicality.
[239:54.58]I'm just gonna feed him a bunch of cakes.
[239:59.91]Give a fuck.
[240:00.83]I'm gonna overfeed the fuck out of him with like meats and cheeses and cakes and ice creams.
[240:07.11]Good.
[240:08.21]We got some bargains.
[240:10.70]I'm gonna fill you full of fucking loyalty.
[240:27.92]What's the highest loyalty food for this dude?
[240:38.06]What for this monster type will just get me the absolute highest potential loyalty?
[240:45.24]I wonder what I should do here.
[240:49.48]Just mangoes and nut oil.
[240:54.84]Give him a snake.
[240:58.48]These are fucking expensive.
[240:59.78]He's gonna hate this though.
[241:13.21]Smokesnake is 600 bucks.
[241:21.87]Reduces form, turns spoil into fear.
[241:28.76]It's a good hate, though.
[241:31.74]It's necessary for discipline.
[241:41.59]Thank you, Ace of Noobs!
[241:42.57]Appreciate that, dude.
[241:43.79]Welcome.
[241:44.03]I'm just gonna buy it.
[241:46.65]I'm gonna save, and then I'm gonna buy it and see if this is a stupid idea.
[242:04.93]Let's see what it does.
[242:06.37]It makes it strict.
[242:08.53]This guy's kind of a dick.
[242:09.59]Yeah, he is.
[242:10.15]Alright, bye.
[242:18.19]Smoked steak.
[242:20.70]Eat it.
[242:23.38]Use.
[242:24.16]You're not gonna like this.
[242:28.66]But you're eating this fucking snake right now.
[242:31.78]Let's see if he does.
[242:38.61]Oh, cute.
[242:39.71]And we lost loyalty.
[242:43.91]And we're soft.
[242:44.57]Oh.
[242:51.21]I thought that was supposed to be strict now.
[243:21.49]He hates me even more.
[243:25.05]Feed him another.
[243:25.79]Get him off soft.
[243:26.88]Get him to even.
[243:28.00]He is very close to being spoiled.
[243:30.52]Uh, PotionSalad, you seem- you know a lot about this game.
[243:33.82]You really do.
[243:35.46]You and uh, that other dude that was in here.
[243:39.12]You guys have been spitting some actual real knowledge here.
[243:47.30]I'm gonna listen to everything you say.
[243:52.32]But I don't have enough money.
[244:01.46]That's what he gets for giving us shit stats in the Rumble.
[244:04.67]What are you talking about?
[244:05.73]You guys are lucky you got any stats at all.
[244:10.77]Uh... What are the... Let me see what I got here.
[244:16.85]200... 201... 201, 200...
[244:22.35]We need to start working on life and speed and defense.
[244:26.27]Yeah, let's do this.
[244:29.71]Let's swim for a little bit.
[244:33.88]I cheated, that's fine.
[244:35.82]Don't even get mad at him.
[244:39.08]No, I am gonna scold him because we, like, we have to make him not soft.
[244:44.04]He has to come back down to even.
[244:46.88]And feed him fucking rotten eggs.
[244:48.89]Is that an option?
[244:59.69]We have to take him down to even.
[245:01.51]We have to punish him.
[245:02.67]We can't just be nice.
[245:03.67]He seems like he's stressed out.
[245:06.83]We need to take care of him.
[245:09.01]Soft still.
[245:11.11]Does he still hate me, though?
[245:12.84]That's the problem.
[245:14.84]Yes.
[245:22.26]Um, alright.
[245:23.94]Training.
[245:24.40]Give it again.
[245:29.97]Am I spoiling him?
[245:31.89]I'll... Now you just hold on a second.
[245:35.17]I want a turn... I don't know if there is one.
[245:37.39]I have no idea if there's a tournament.
[245:39.30]You can't drop this on me with I don't... I didn't look at the schedule.
[245:43.70]I can't promise you something that I don't know is real.
[245:49.23]No, go fuck yourself.
[245:50.59]Sorry.
[246:00.92]Let's see if it was going to be right.
[246:04.58]Okay, there was a tournament today.
[246:06.28]Of course there was.
[246:12.67]Take a rest.
[246:17.57]He's not going to run away.
[246:18.51]His loyalty is too high.
[246:23.85]Uh, what do we got for... Let's see.
[246:27.49]I could send him to training, maybe.
[246:32.57]E. I wonder if I should just get some money here.
[246:37.71]No, we need to do a D cup.
[246:38.69]Let's see.
[246:39.15]We got this one.
[246:39.87]This is the Gallop and we just missed it.
[246:41.57]We got this one here.
[246:43.15]The Parry Parry Cup.
[246:44.79]Let's do that one.
[246:47.31]So let's do... I mean, he's going to be real dumb, but at least he'll be hardy.
[246:58.62]I want to participate in a tournament and fight next week.
[247:01.99]No.
[247:02.67]Not... No.
[247:06.06]There is no tournament next week.
[247:17.98]See?
[247:18.46]They keep on throwing this at you.
[247:20.48]There was no tournament.
[247:26.49]We'll be able to do D pretty easily, I think.
[247:32.32]Do you want, like, a fuckin'... Fatigue... Mango... Give him another mint leaf.
[247:45.47]Is it candy that raises loyalty?
[247:47.07]Yeah, but it'll spoil him even more than he already is.
[247:49.31]There we go, okay, so... Tomorrow, rest up for the tournament tomorrow.
[247:57.24]D cup.
[248:02.53]No, we're not going to replace him.
[248:03.41]We're stuck with him.
[248:10.73]We're too soft on him.
[248:15.86]Take a goddamn potato this week.
[248:27.76]No, we're not getting rid of him.
[248:28.78]It's another 30 minutes of disc scanning.
[248:31.42]That's not going to happen, I assure you.
[248:34.66]And here we go.
[248:35.86]Time for some more training.
[248:37.70]Fuck the tournament.
[248:45.33]He's very well.
[248:48.37]Oh.
[248:58.68]Turning now.
[248:59.48]No, I'm not fighting.
[249:02.51]He needs to... He's got a week or two.
[249:05.51]What do we need?
[249:08.09]I would say... I'm going to do speed this time.
[249:12.89]He needs it bad.
[249:13.59]How am I still soft?
[249:20.87]I've been doing nothing but punishing him and talking shit.
[249:25.34]I just need to get...
[249:27.82]Seems like every time I try to get loyalty, he gets spoiled.
[249:30.50]And then I try to bring the spoiling down, and then something stupid happens, and he loses 20 loyalty.
[249:40.14]He likes to fight, though.
[249:42.04]Let him fight.
[249:44.42]He likes to fight.
[249:45.62]Let's try to win, and then we can do the training.
[249:51.68]Coupons are for the whole month.
[249:52.44]Yeah, I know the coupons are for the whole month.
[250:03.60]Send him to the desert to fight Satan.
[250:08.51]This hopefully is a pretty... Let's hope this isn't easy.
[250:14.99]Or not easy, but enough of a challenge where it's still fun, but I make money.
[250:20.07]But he has 15 loyalty, so probably gonna miss like 10 moves.
[250:27.75]Okay.
[250:27.89]Okay.
[250:30.19]Terrible speed, terrible skill.
[250:32.61]We should be able to hit pretty much every single move.
[250:36.29]And he has high defense, but we should be able to burn him down by then, because he's not going to be able to dodge anything.
[250:42.23]So just stab him in the face with your tail.
[250:47.77]We can't let him do that move.
[250:49.35]Close the gap.
[250:52.20]Okay.
[250:55.48]Well, you knew it was going to happen.
[251:05.30]I gotta hit this again.
[251:12.80]Stab, stab, stab.
[251:14.38]Do it.
[251:15.50]Do it.
[251:16.78]Do it.
[251:17.46]Stop worshiping him and do it.
[251:20.68]Stop it.
[251:21.16]Stop doing the Mike Myers I'm not worthy from Wayne's World.
[251:24.68]Just hit him in the face.
[251:26.41]Thank you.
[251:35.40]What happened to the purple dog?
[251:36.40]Uh, purple dog's still around.
[251:41.75]We're trying to level up this guy to combine him and the purple dog so we get something cool.
[251:53.73]We're not worthy!
[251:55.11]We're not worthy!
[252:02.78]Final BB's destination.
[252:07.98]Uh-oh.
[252:09.66]Well, uh... This might be hard.
[252:14.78]As long as I land moves.
[252:17.97]I think this is just one of those times where it's a stab technique.
[252:23.11]Stab technique is what we're doing here.
[252:25.23]Don't let anybody tell you differently.
[252:27.23]Only stabs.
[252:28.69]All of the time.
[252:32.69]Good.
[252:34.20]Same damn stab, same damn network.
[252:37.14]You know what I mean?
[252:37.68]Same damn time.
[252:40.48]Now we back up all the way to the end.
[252:42.61]He can't do any moves.
[252:44.31]I'm coming in for a stab.
[252:46.39]Bounce him back.
[252:50.35]Not like a hundred.
[252:52.31]It's a lot, but fuck.
[253:00.98]Bounce it.
[253:03.77]Don't do that again.
[253:07.44]Bingo.
[253:09.44]Oh no, don't- You're one of these idiots.
[253:13.28]Not even- Oh no, fuck me.
[253:18.25]Fuck me, dude.
[253:19.03]Fuck me.
[253:19.45]Stay back.
[253:20.23]Just stay back.
[253:21.01]Three, two, one, z- Dodge this!
[253:42.54]If I got in close, then that was just totally up and down the whole thing.
[253:48.53]If I tried to stay back, then he might do a move.
[253:52.49]The chances of me trying to go all the way back were the same as me going forward and him doing any move to kill me.
[254:01.18]Even if I went in and got in close and tried to stab, there's an equal amount of opportunity there for him to just do one move and I die.
[254:06.36]Or for me to get fooled and die.
[254:31.82]Just give him tablets.
[254:36.70]I'm gonna just stuff dietary supplements down his throat.
[254:43.53]Hit him.
[254:46.19]Please, just do a move.
[254:50.54]Get in there.
[254:51.52]And do a move to him.
[254:54.00]You're getting really lucky as well, but you can't hit him either.
[254:58.67]Don't even let him do anything.
[255:01.83]Just back it up.
[255:03.01]Don't... Don't get hit by the fucking Death Cube.
[255:06.03]I just need to... I need to work on his loyalty so bad.
[255:21.99]We should be 3-0 right now.
[255:23.71]I am so salty about this shit.
[255:36.72]That guy who has a melted ice cream cone.
[255:45.76]Ice cream versus a smoothie.
[255:51.67]Still possible.
[255:53.47]Now we have to beat him.
[255:54.53]We have to beat this dude.
[255:56.98]So, let's go.
[256:01.12]Best way to earn loyalty fighting is quick.
[256:03.60]The best way to earn quick loyalty is fighting.
[256:08.30]What's with the question marks?
[256:09.24]What happened?
[256:09.88]What did I do?
[256:10.76]What did I say?
[256:12.14]Did I say something weird?
[256:13.82]What's the weird thing I said?
[256:20.10]No, don't do the...
[256:32.64]Shit.
[256:39.91]I gotta dodge one of these.
[256:43.93]Mmm, it's gonna be close.
[256:47.99]Stay in there, stay in there.
[256:49.31]Oh, fine, stay all the way back.
[256:51.31]Get some Gotspringadin.
[256:54.56]Again.
[256:56.32]Mmm, get lucky here, come on!
[257:01.82]Tyranny victory!
[257:08.95]I'm gonna dress up for this guy.
[257:25.17]I'm gonna dress up.
[257:30.66]I'm gonna dress up for this guy.
[257:32.78]Uh, I'm gonna dra- ah fuck, what, don't, just delete it, who cares.
[257:36.00]Give me some fame.
[257:44.49]Thank you.
[257:52.29]Now let's go get speed.
[258:05.75]You learned a lesson.
[258:10.54]Good.
[258:11.90]Intelligence is back over level 3.
[258:13.58]That's good.
[258:14.98]You learned a bunch of speed.
[258:15.88]That's also very good.
[258:18.42]You did a great job.
[258:19.68]No praising.
[258:21.66]I don't care how angry you are.
[258:23.06]You need to come back down from being soft.
[258:26.70]Even.
[258:28.02]Now we got 14 loyalty.
[258:30.44]Now... Now is the time.
[258:33.89]Forrest gets him.
[258:38.13]He's perfect now.
[258:40.51]When's the next battle?
[258:42.71]This one's official.
[258:43.47]We're gonna skip that fucking thing.
[258:47.15]No, we're not.
[258:48.89]No, we are.
[258:49.17]Actually, no, maybe I can do it.
[258:53.44]Go to bed.
[259:11.58]Just keep him uneven, do fights... Alright, hold on, I gotta read this.
[259:18.01]Just keep him uneven, do fights every now and again.
[259:20.69]Every four weeks, rest him and give him a mint.
[259:23.23]As every time you get that stress message, his lifespan will be lowered.
[259:25.95]It's also early in his life, do the easy training, and when he gets into... And when he gets into, add one heavy training into the weekly regimen, or two, you can afford more mints.
[259:36.66]Okay, so it's all about giving him mints.
[259:43.52]Alright, I got it.
[259:46.25]Let's go.
[259:46.71]Let's go.
[259:47.47]Let's go.
[259:48.09]When's the next battle?
[259:49.79]Tomorrow.
[259:51.19]Train.
[259:51.71]Let's drill speed.
[259:52.75]He's not escaping.
[259:58.93]He's doing a fine job.
[259:59.71]That's gonna be a success.
[260:11.92]There's a couple of Monster Rancher gurus in here, so that's really good.
[260:17.65]Seems well.
[260:18.21]17 loyalty, though.
[260:19.35]I'm not ready for it.
[260:21.03]I'm not doing it.
[260:21.63]I'm not doing it.
[260:31.17]I mean, am I doing it?
[260:37.67]I probably should.
[260:41.77]Six.
[260:42.29]If I can win a bunch, you'll get more loyalty.
[260:43.94]I don't think he can do it.
[260:46.00]I'll save it, though.
[260:54.86]So let me ask this one more question.
[260:56.67]Just one more time.
[260:57.59]Just for total transparency here.
[260:59.89]If he has low loyalty and I let him fight on his own, does that mean that he won't do all those dumb things?
[261:13.95]Give him a mint first.
[261:23.89]Do I have any extra mints?
[261:25.56]He still will do that.
[261:29.18]What the hell does this thing do?
[261:31.78]It said that a monster will feel great if it drinks from this.
[261:40.23]No difference.
[261:41.33]I'm skipping the tournament.
[261:42.85]I want to do more training.
[261:44.13]I want to get his speed up.
[261:45.89]We're not ready for that shit.
[261:50.18]I'm going to go buy a bunch of mint.
[261:54.84]We're going to wait for the sale.
[261:56.38]No, I'm skipping.
[262:14.01]I'm giving him a... I'm gonna give him a tablet.
[262:21.38]Should I feed him a damn tablet right now?
[262:23.38]Give him an iPad.
[262:38.05]Yeah, give him one of those.
[262:38.73]Give him his favorite iPad.
[262:39.55]Yeah, he doesn't like jelly.
[262:50.78]Let's just do it.
[262:51.86]See what happens to him.
[262:53.38]Feed him a tablet.
[262:58.56]Wait, wait, hold on, wait, wait.
[262:59.88]The Errantry sale was going on still?
[263:07.98]Was it still going on?
[263:09.50]Did I completely fucking miss that?
[263:12.45]I probably did.
[263:19.65]Uh, it doesn't really matter.
[263:20.53]I'll get it again.
[263:23.45]I'm just gonna feed it to him.
[263:24.43]Whatever, fuck it.
[263:25.83]Yeah, it's a PlayStation 1.
[263:31.40]Seems even.
[263:33.12]When is it?
[263:33.60]Uh, fuck it.
[263:49.61]Yeah, I missed it, didn't I?
[263:50.74]When was the last time I saved it?
[263:52.48]Because I didn't want to train him.
[263:54.70]Just, like, getting too confused for every mechanic in this game is bleeding into my brain at the same time.
[264:04.63]You still hate the name?
[264:05.65]Well, the name sucks, but it has to stay.
[264:13.00]Why?
[264:13.28]Because I fucked up and I didn't do the errantry that I wanted to do.
[264:20.47]Who's rolling down the boulders from the guy's fucking house?
[264:23.45]That's a good question.
[264:35.23]You saved a day ago before... Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[264:37.57]Hold on.
[264:37.97]What?
[264:38.73]Am I just getting, like, hyper fucking confused right now?
[264:46.03]No, I'm not.
[264:47.03]Okay.
[264:48.25]Just do it.
[264:49.81]Let's go.
[264:55.53]I'm gonna do speed.
[265:02.55]I don't give a fuck about missing the tournament.
[265:07.21]No, yeah, yeah.
[265:07.73]I got too much foolery.
[265:13.85]Good.
[265:14.49]New tech.
[265:14.91]Alright.
[265:15.25]Good, good, good, good, good.
[265:16.21]Keep it going.
[265:16.65]Go, go, go, go, go.
[265:23.33]Get that speed up.
[265:31.02]Three in a row.
[265:31.42]Good.
[265:33.22]Keep it rolling, buddy.
[265:35.66]This is the polar bears.
[265:36.36]We're gonna watch the first five seconds of this.
[265:38.34]Okay.
[265:43.71]Got a new tech.
[265:44.83]This one's a sharp tech, so this will be hopefully good.
[265:49.51]Seems pretty strong.
[265:50.31]Praise it.
[265:50.75]No.
[265:52.15]We praise every time, and it ends up being bad.
[265:58.05]He's very tired.
[265:59.59]Now we're strict.
[266:00.43]That's okay, because now I can alleviate some of that stress.
[266:03.51]Let's see what it is.
[266:08.39]Ooh, baby.
[266:10.05]Energy shot.
[266:17.85]But this is an intelligence move.
[266:19.39]It's a C for crit.
[266:24.88]C for damage.
[266:32.15]Uh, let him rest.
[266:33.27]Yeah, it is int.
[266:38.37]Although it could- that could work out with monsters that I have to get some space from.
[266:45.45]And I am gonna do tablets again, as well.
[266:57.46]His life gets shorter every time.
[267:10.60]You guys are fucking... Seriously.
[267:13.80]He was sick one time!
[267:15.00]Alright, battle.
[267:18.76]We got a D tournament coming up here.
[267:20.10]I'm gonna do it.
[267:22.10]I'm gonna get a disc chip and a thousand dollars.
[267:23.86]Let's fight.
[267:24.46]Alright, how's he doing?
[267:28.32]Maybe do a drill?
[267:29.82]Let's do power one more time.
[267:36.63]Maybe I'll just do int as well, the next air entry.
[267:44.21]Because it's not worth doing intellect right now.
[267:49.03]Oh, fucking stupid.
[267:51.67]God damn it.
[267:53.95]Get in there.
[267:54.57]Just get in there.
[267:55.51]You'll be fine.
[268:08.46]Alright, we're going to go go Toril's Prowler.
[268:18.65]He's not going to the hospital.
[268:19.67]This is a D tournament.
[268:25.91]We're going up against Millium.
[268:27.63]You guys are that scared of Millium?
[268:33.40]Alright, this guy actually is kind of a problem.
[268:36.66]Remember when I said PG only streamed two hours ago?
[268:46.44]Yeah.
[268:49.41]But he's a liar.
[268:51.94]Up close and personal.
[268:53.24]Let's just do a beam real quick, just to see what it does.
[268:57.04]I mean, that's awesome.
[268:58.54]That's really cool.
[268:59.20]He throws like a fireball.
[269:00.22]Underhanded, though.
[269:00.98]Come on, man.
[269:01.48]If he threw that overhand, it'd be much better.
[269:06.88]Get in close.
[269:07.74]Stab.
[269:08.12]Really need you to hit those.
[269:22.90]Like that.
[269:23.52]Thank you.
[269:25.64]Stay all the way back.
[269:28.28]Because he has enough of them.
[269:30.99]And I could always toss a softball at him.
[269:35.39]I want it to hit.
[269:40.55]Don't get cocky here.
[269:41.33]How come he gets to do that move first?
[269:44.49]Don't get cocky.
[269:45.13]Hit him.
[269:46.25]Yeah, get angry and swing.
[269:48.55]Don't get angry and pray.
[269:50.33]Get angry and swing.
[269:52.21]Swing at him.
[269:52.91]Oh, that was so fucking lucky.
[269:56.23]You wouldn't even believe it.
[270:02.40]You would not even believe how lucky that just was.
[270:13.70]That was good.
[270:15.99]Got good RNG.
[270:20.25]Millium is seriously the final contestant.
[270:26.56]Easiest thing we've done all day.
[270:39.06]Did I miss a $50 donation three hours ago?
[270:46.59]Wow.
[270:50.16]Whoa, wow.
[270:53.74]Holy shit.
[270:55.64]I did.
[271:01.25]Wow, my god.
[271:02.67]Sorry I missed that 50 fucking dollars.
[271:06.39]KXE501, thank you for the 50 bucks, dude.
[271:14.74]Then KXZ says, delete Doggo for the ultimate evil plot twist.
[271:20.93]L-U-L.
[271:23.57]In great, no, I just, I got my headphones, I plugged into my computer and I can only hear the audio from the game and I can't, I couldn't, I'm sorry I missed your huge amount of money.
[271:34.90]Thank you, KXZ.
[271:36.48]Hopefully you're still here.
[271:39.94]But I'm sorry I missed it.
[271:43.02]This one's for you.
[271:44.29]Watch this.
[271:44.95]One-hit KO.
[271:46.85]Ready?
[271:47.15]Three, two, one.
[271:49.65]I told you that was for you.
[271:53.23]I just killed somebody in one hit.
[272:01.03]I'm addicted to ranch dressing.
[272:02.47]Yeah, I kind of am.
[272:06.87]No, I'm not.
[272:07.43]I don't even like ranch dressing.
[272:09.04]Blue cheese is... Blue cheese is just ranch dressing, but just tastes way better.
[272:15.72]It's got way more going on.
[272:17.70]Ranch dressing is watery, gross blue cheese.
[272:20.06]Like, just eat creamy blue cheese.
[272:22.94]It's way better.
[272:29.25]Any items or no?
[272:30.61]Yeah.
[272:40.73]What?
[272:40.85]You guys don't like blue cheese?
[272:42.23]What are you talking about?
[272:43.33]Why?
[272:45.93]You don't like the creamy texture and the dipping?
[272:48.66]What do you eat your buffalo fingers with?
[272:51.70]Don't tell me you do buffalo fingers in a ranch.
[272:54.84]Don't be one of those people.
[272:57.00]Don't be one of those people.
[272:58.26]You do buffalo fingers in a ranch?
[273:01.03]I don't know if I... Don't be one of those people.
[273:11.18]Eating buffalo fingers in 2018.
[273:12.22]What are you on a- what are you- of course you- they're delicious, they're unbelievably yummy and tasty.
[273:19.17]You're eating a buffalo blue cheese right now, exactly.
[273:23.19]Buffalo fingers.
[273:24.45]Why does that make you angry when I say buffalo fingers?
[273:31.84]That's what they are.
[273:32.50]Buffalo tenders?
[273:35.76]Buffalo tenders.
[273:39.28]Buffalo wings?
[273:40.26]No, wings have bones in them.
[273:43.44]Buffalo wings don't have... They have bones inside them.
[273:47.16]Buffalo finger is a tender.
[273:53.93]Come on.
[273:57.89]They're wings.
[273:59.37]No, they're not.
[274:01.16]Chicken tenders.
[274:05.34]Buffalo finger.
[274:07.84]Boneless wings.
[274:10.04]Well, here's the problem.
[274:12.62]A boneless strip of chicken, when you go to a restaurant and you order buffalo tenders, that's not a wing, that's not wing meat.
[274:21.26]Boneless wings, I'm sorry, you're getting like ground up chicken that's been fried, it's like a chicken patty.
[274:28.21]Boneless buffalo wings?
[274:33.71]You're talking about like just shaved chicken thighs.
[274:40.78]They don't use wing meat in that shit.
[274:42.24]They use the cat food quality chicken.
[274:48.20]Let's go train.
[274:49.68]I'm gonna do this one.
[274:52.23]Intelligence and... lose defense though.
[274:55.95]What if I just do int?
[274:57.07]Just... Let's go read a book.
[275:03.28]How many more Monster Rancher streams are there gonna be?
[275:06.34]None after this one.
[275:11.22]I cheated.
[275:17.86]That's a higher quality than my streams.
[275:21.36]I don't believe that for a second.
[275:24.28]Is your cat watching this stream right now?
[275:26.98]I rest my case.
[275:36.56]How do you study chi- How do you cheat?
[275:38.58]Yeah, what, did he copy the paper?
[275:44.47]My dog's watching the street?
[275:49.10]Dogs are smarter than cats.
[275:55.60]Alright, we got 222 loyalty.
[276:04.61]He's even.
[276:07.04]When's the next battle?
[276:08.08]Right now.
[276:08.70]Magic banana.
[276:11.30]I want to train him again.
[276:13.37]We need to level up here.
[276:14.87]We need to get some... I feel like he's just not that good at anything.
[276:19.31]He's kind of okay at everything.
[276:25.03]You know what I'm saying?
[276:25.81]I feel like... I feel like he's just very mediocre in every category.
[276:35.89]Maybe I should just focus on power and skill.
[276:40.65]Just only do power and skill.
[276:43.51]Or do it and maybe just get it.
[276:44.51]Maybe just have them as completely balanced.
[276:52.43]Is there a speed and intelligence?
[276:54.39]Is intelligence and skill?
[276:55.63]There is.
[276:55.99]I'm gonna do this.
[276:59.49]I'll get the power back.
[277:00.35]It's only minus two.
[277:04.35]That's not a big deal.
[277:05.03]I can do this a few times.
[277:11.50]He's tired.
[277:12.02]Let him sleep and do it again.
[277:26.55]And train again.
[277:28.91]I want to do this a few times.
[277:32.25]The power is negligible how much I'm losing.
[277:35.75]I can get it back very easily.
[277:36.97]Let's get speed to 200.
[277:45.59]No official tournament.
[277:49.87]One more time.
[277:50.37]Good.
[277:50.59]Three in a row.
[277:51.71]Nice.
[277:51.85]Okay.
[277:52.01]204, 126.
[277:52.05]We'll do power now.
[277:54.77]Let's do another thing.
[277:57.47]A fish is fine.
[278:15.34]Beanbag Sonic has been turned into another monster.
[278:20.78]That monster was then put on ice, and we made this guy, whose sole purpose is to exist, to be a stat boost for the next monster we make when we combine two in a row.
[278:33.25]Alright, is it... If it's item shop, we're gonna buy, like, five mints.
[278:37.39]Yeah, let's go buy a shitload of mints.
[278:44.69]Okay.
[278:45.59]Item.
[278:47.01]Mints.
[278:48.93]Buy like five of them.
[278:55.08]Buy as many as I can.
[279:03.32]Good old mint ice cream.
[279:04.50]One more for good luck.
[279:05.22]Okay.
[279:05.40]Wait, let me go to sell for a second.
[279:13.67]Flower disc chips.
[279:16.19]This is 500 for a disc chip.
[279:17.81]500 for a star prune.
[279:19.75]There's this Gemini pot.
[279:23.07]1500!
[279:27.96]Wow.
[279:30.74]Chip of plants disc.
[279:32.54]1500 for this.
[279:33.96]Why is this one so expensive?
[279:40.38]Jeremy, if you read this, the world explodes.
[279:43.24]Oh.
[279:48.82]Wonder if I should sell the pot.
[279:54.27]I don't- I mean, I'm not desperate for money right now, so... I'll be alright.
[279:57.47]Okay, what have we got for a battle here?
[280:00.97]Comin' up.
[280:02.23]We got a D1, I think he's ready for C. This disc chip, we can- we can do them both.
[280:09.30]You know, yeah, fuck it, let's do them both.
[280:10.96]Rest.
[280:12.40]Rest up, we'll do D and C. He didn't say when.
[280:19.89]I'm going to say... I don't know.
[280:31.05]When is it going to happen, man?
[280:35.04]Too many disc chips.
[280:35.82]Well, if I run into an issue where I need some money, I'll sell it.
[280:39.06]I don't need them right now.
[280:48.09]Give him some sweet potatoes.
[280:51.75]Actually, I'm very, very much surprised at the complexity that this game actually has.
[280:57.18]There's a lot going on here under the hood.
[281:01.98]I did not know that.
[281:06.76]William again.
[281:07.38]Let's go for another one-hit kill.
[281:09.97]Alright, if I get a one-hit kill then the world explodes, okay?
[281:24.16]Yeah, here we go.
[281:30.90]It's alright.
[281:34.62]It's okay.
[281:37.94]Good thing the world is not going to blow up.
[281:39.80]That's good.
[281:41.56]I'm happy about that.
[281:50.93]The world's fine.
[281:51.51]The world is safe.
[281:55.22]Let's see.
[281:56.58]Back-to-back tournaments.
[281:57.76]Hopefully we'll be at, like, 30 or 40 loyalty after that.
[282:01.74]Let him sleep for a day, and then hopefully get some air entry.
[282:05.40]Do some more skill, maybe.
[282:06.94]Maybe some more power.
[282:08.48]Maybe speed.
[282:10.28]Or maybe intelligence.
[282:11.25]I don't know.
[282:11.65]Maybe we should just keep him completely well-rounded.
[282:18.19]Palmer versus Mr. Iceberg.
[282:26.14]I sound sad?
[282:26.96]Wait, why do I sound sad?
[282:30.77]Sad?
[282:33.87]I'm not sad.
[282:38.57]I'm actually very well right now.
[282:40.71]How are you?
[282:41.09]I'm not asking you how you're doing.
[282:43.45]Let me ask you.
[282:44.83]How do you guys feel right now?
[282:45.75]You guys alright?
[282:46.25]How are things going?
[282:50.31]You guys cool?
[282:50.81]Everything good?
[282:52.79]How's shit going?
[283:01.43]Tired?
[283:02.53]What if he just said, fuck you, Jeremy?
[283:06.15]I'm asking how you are!
[283:07.17]What?
[283:07.51]Come on!
[283:10.91]I'm just trying to see how you're doing.
[283:14.17]Happy because of this stream.
[283:15.31]Hey!
[283:15.63]Well, thanks, man.
[283:17.49]Thank you.
[283:17.81]I left for an hour.
[283:25.41]Why are you still playing?
[283:30.05]Because, I don't know, because I want to.
[283:36.97]We're playing a game that I like.
[283:39.51]It's fun.
[283:40.19]And it's cute.
[283:41.72]And we've gotten like three emotes from this game.
[283:44.86]We've gotten at least four Germa Rumble characters from this game.
[283:49.28]Two emotes, probably.
[283:57.60]There's at least two new Rumble characters.
[284:02.08]That I can count on one hand.
[284:09.11]You have too many items.
[284:10.13]Choose and throw one away.
[284:13.43]Throw the flower away, right?
[284:14.71]Oh no.
[284:16.31]The mangoes?
[284:18.89]Shit.
[284:19.65]I'm throwing the flower in the trash.
[284:25.10]The nut oil?
[284:31.62]Probably a mango, yeah.
[284:33.78]Mango's dumb.
[284:34.68]They were like 50 bucks.
[284:41.70]New emote.
[284:45.11]Streamer can only count to two and has to use his hands.
[284:53.89]I can do this without a problem, so...
[285:04.22]It's not going to be an issue.
[285:06.52]I learned some things.
[285:07.22]It's a stick.
[285:14.88]A one.
[285:15.28]V. V.
[285:39.94]One.
[286:14.90]No, I wanted to praise it!
[286:15.76]What the hell?
[286:24.24]Actually, that's okay.
[286:25.31]I'm alright with that.
[286:28.67]He's googling the answers.
[286:35.23]Yeah, okay, let me google that for you.
[286:39.63]Alright.
[286:40.49]Use Mint Leaf.
[286:48.25]And then Train.
[286:49.39]Yeah, it's okay being strict.
[286:55.24]We're always soft on every monster.
[287:00.54]Now, give us a discount.
[287:04.98]2,000.
[287:07.00]Back-to-back tournaments.
[287:08.04]He's got it.
[287:08.54]Back-to-back tourneys.
[287:21.98]Alright, wait, Potion Salad.
[287:23.46]Resident, like, guy that I listen to with everything he's ever written.
[287:27.46]Focus on power, skill, and defense.
[287:31.58]Stop it.
[287:31.94]Stop talking!
[287:35.26]Speed are not that great, and Int is his worst stat to train, so don't bother with him.
[287:40.70]But he is a fantastic... Stop it!
[287:43.26]I can't read it!
[287:49.49]I can't read it!
[287:54.07]Stop the voices!
[287:57.47]Okay, I said power, skill, and defense are the ones I'm supposed to be doing.
[288:01.11]He said something else.
[288:01.98]He's the fucking smartest guy here right now.
[288:07.84]No, it doesn't help when everybody says it.
[288:10.52]I need to copy and paste it.
[288:12.40]Got it.
[288:12.80]Okay.
[288:13.66]Thank you.
[288:16.98]Thank you.
[288:19.64]Why did I write it?
[288:21.48]Just wait a second.
[288:22.44]Why did I write that?
[288:24.37]Like I was gonna help me.
[288:25.35]Now people are doing Germacraft.
[288:28.44]Stop it!
[288:34.17]He has fantastic power.
[288:37.80]Beatstick you don't need the same amount of skills power, but keeping it high is still a good idea Get a bit more defense and focus on power, and he will be good if it was me I'd make him a power cannon with reasonable defense and good skill so basically power skill Defense and doing tournaments are great for this guy Got it Thanks, man We together wrote that forum post
[289:08.70]About being in the second grade.
[289:19.20]Mr. Ice Cream versus Susvane.
[289:22.40]Terrible int.
[289:23.72]Awful int.
[289:25.28]Slightly high defense.
[289:27.80]Good power.
[289:29.72]Just watch this one, though.
[289:32.16]Lightning Bolt!
[289:33.62]Come on.
[289:33.98]I don't think he'd like that.
[289:37.63]Wanna do that too?
[289:38.69]Energy shot.
[289:42.64]Get it, get it, get it, get it!
[289:44.70]Again!
[289:46.04]Alright, back it up, back it up.
[289:46.92]Stay back, he can't do shit.
[289:47.94]Just only energy shot.
[289:51.16]Hit him with a five-hour energy shot.
[289:54.82]Only 25 calories.
[289:56.99]And enough energy packed with B vitamins to let you last all the way through second shift.
[290:01.03]Alright, stop it and fucking hit him.
[290:02.97]Stop making awful jokes that no one's gonna laugh at.
[290:05.59]Stop it, Jeremy!
[290:10.97]I'm our energy.
[290:13.93]Come on.
[290:16.19]Get it.
[290:17.67]Get in there.
[290:19.39]Get in there.
[290:21.47]You stupid, you suck.
[290:32.98]No crash.
[290:34.24]There's no crash in the end of your shift.
[290:37.52]Fucking god damn it.
[290:38.88]I'm so not happy about this.
[290:43.25]I can still do it.
[290:49.73]You sound like an angry father.
[290:51.95]Chat, laugh.
[290:52.57]Quick, I need to think I'm funny.
[290:54.96]See, now I'll kick this guy's ass because all he does is eat bananas.
[291:01.68]Now that's all we need to do.
[291:02.66]Now just stay back.
[291:03.96]Throw a fucking energy bowling ball at him.
[291:07.46]Okay, now eat your banana.
[291:09.88]And have it not do a damn thing, because it never does.
[291:11.80]Okay, good.
[291:12.50]Good for you.
[291:13.50]Nice work.
[291:13.86]Now you have no stamina.
[291:16.18]Get in there.
[291:16.62]Hit him with the tail.
[291:19.57]Hit him with the whack.
[291:23.39]Nope, back it up.
[291:25.11]Eat another banana.
[291:26.15]Stupid.
[291:26.53]Mm-hmm.
[291:30.81]I know that's what you're gonna do.
[291:31.63]Do it.
[291:34.08]Tasty banana.
[291:38.03]Why don't you do it?
[291:43.66]Everyone's laughing about the thing I said?
[291:44.90]Nice, they like what I'm saying.
[291:48.18]I should probably keep doing it, then.
[291:51.70]He really likes the 5-hour energy thing.
[291:53.22]I should probably keep doing it, then.
[291:55.97]Yeah.
[291:56.43]That sounds like a good idea.
[291:59.61]The chat says that they thought it was really funny, so... Might as well keep doing it.
[292:18.74]Now I'm gonna be fine.
[292:19.68]No, I'm not.
[292:20.80]I'm in second place.
[292:28.56]Everybody's... All the new viewers that are coming in are just... And why do I just automatically assume that a bunch of new viewers are here?
[292:36.20]Yeah, all like these new fucking viewers, man.
[292:38.32]There are just so many of them coming in.
[292:43.84]I shouldn't lose fame here.
[292:48.21]Well, one of you guys left.
[292:53.53]Alright, no, no, sir, for real, for real, I wanna be, be real with me, don't lie to me, I'll know, I will know, you can't lie.
[292:59.59]How many people here, this is their first stream that they've ever seen?
[293:02.23]And you didn't, you didn't see me on YouTube ever, like, over the last, like, six, seven years.
[293:06.65]This is the only fucking time you've ever seen this stream, and it's, you came from Twitch, that's it, like, somehow.
[293:15.80]Me, me, me, look at, look at all these people!
[293:20.03]Now I have to convert you to be sticking around!
[293:25.83]Look at all these new people!
[293:26.86]Look at all these new viewers!
[293:27.92]That's encouraging.
[293:37.34]This is the first and last time.
[293:40.12]Remember when I came down here with a bathrobe on?
[293:53.33]I'm just here for the Monster Rancher.
[293:56.77]What about me?
[293:58.79]This is a crying face.
[294:04.95]I just... This is crying on camera.
[294:07.76]Alright, what food are we gonna get?
[294:18.07]Take it or leave it.
[294:20.99]Let's give him some meat this month.
[294:23.78]Stuff him up, get him fat.
[294:30.22]Me, they say with their subscription icons.
[294:41.18]Please don't cry.
[294:43.78]30 loyalty.
[294:44.30]That is almost a 33% chance to get a good swing.
[294:49.88]What do we need now?
[294:51.34]We need some power and skill.
[294:55.44]Power, skill, and defense.
[294:57.25]You know, I don't want to wait for it.
[294:59.05]We got a C tournament coming up here.
[295:02.15]We're going to miss it.
[295:03.35]I want to train.
[295:03.93]Let's train in power.
[295:06.25]Absolutely.
[295:07.79]Absolutely.
[295:10.19]I'm in a really weird mood tonight, guys.
[295:11.59]I'm sorry.
[295:12.03]I'm like a fucking weirdo.
[295:15.74]It's so weird and random, right?
[295:18.00]This is the part where you guys say, stop it.
[295:24.65]Power.
[295:34.99]Success.
[295:39.58]So random.
[295:46.98]God.
[295:51.08]Sleeping Hamel.
[295:53.58]New tech.
[295:54.18]Ah.
[295:54.90]I will.
[295:59.03]This... Skipping animations?
[296:00.23]Yeah, we've seen this a hundred times.
[296:01.59]Fine, I'll skip this one.
[296:04.83]No, I won't skip this one.
[296:06.19]No, yes I will.
[296:07.35]Because this is the Boba Fett one.
[296:08.35]This one takes way too long.
[296:11.35]And we got a new tech.
[296:12.67]It's okay.
[296:18.01]5,000 Bitcoin to stream Roblox.
[296:21.73]Dude, if you gave me 5,000 Bitcoin, I would come to your house and hang out with you.
[296:25.75]I would like come be your new brother if you gave me 5,000 Bitcoin.
[296:30.81]That's like millions of dollars, dude.
[296:35.43]Uh-oh.
[296:37.63]Time to leave.
[296:45.67]I couldn't do it fast enough.
[296:50.22]If he doesn't... I was going to say, if I landed one hit and it was a big hit... Yeah, 5,000 Bitcoin is more money than any... I could just... I would be somebody's personal clown for 5,000 Bitcoin.
[297:23.02]Dude, that's like, are you serious?
[297:25.54]That's like somebody saying, hey, you know, if you play Roblox, I'll give you 50 million dollars.
[297:32.60]It's like, are you going to say no to that?
[297:35.18]Why would you say no?
[297:38.44]Nah, sorry, man.
[297:39.96]Just really not a big fan of Roblox.
[297:44.20]I would probably eat glass for 50 million dollars.
[297:51.14]Jesus.
[298:02.68]Could not acquire any techniques, but it was pretty successful.
[298:12.51]That would kill you.
[298:13.67]Well, if I had $50 million, I would eat it immediately.
[298:16.27]This is what I would do.
[298:16.91]No, I don't have... Do I have any candy here?
[298:21.34]I don't think I have any candy to demonstrate this.
[298:23.14]No, I don't.
[298:23.90]I would just eat it really quick.
[298:24.93]Okay, so I'd be like, alright, you ready?
[298:26.55]Like, 50 million dollars, alright.
[298:28.43]Like, take the glass.
[298:31.79]Swallow, swallow.
[298:33.29]And then I would just start screaming at the guy in his face like, give me the money!
[298:36.09]Give me the money right now, let's go!
[298:38.17]And then I would speed to the emergency room and just drop the briefcase with like a million dollars in cash and just be like, somebody in here save me!
[298:47.35]And it would happen.
[298:49.25]I would come out on top.
[298:50.63]I would come out with even more defense, power, and skill.
[298:55.95]I would drive myself to the emergency room the second after eating it.
[298:59.01]And just be like, somebody save me!
[299:00.27]Right now!
[299:00.67]I got a million dollars.
[299:01.45]Hook me up to whatever machine you have to.
[299:03.54]And take it out.
[299:12.02]American healthcare.
[299:18.87]It's like you cut, like the video, I don't know what I'm saying with the video, like it just cuts to like, fucking graveyard, like my name on a fucking tombstone.
[299:28.27]I got a million dollars, who's gonna save my life?
[299:33.28]In the fucking ground.
[299:34.58]I don't have that much money, let's do fish.
[299:49.67]One million will cover the checkup.
[299:52.71]Oh, nice SNL skin.
[300:01.02]Cuts to the ambulance, yeah.
[300:02.50]Will the- Yeah, why- Cuts to the ambulance taking me away?
[300:06.44]Why would the ambulance take me away out of the hospital?
[300:13.44]How's he doing?
[300:15.91]Free Errantry.
[300:17.39]We're doing power again.
[300:19.71]Not the item shop.
[300:20.47]The item shop is ass.
[300:21.69]Here we go.
[300:22.43]Alright, here we go.
[300:25.88]We're going to take care of him.
[300:27.82]I'm not too hard on him.
[300:28.64]He's not going to pass.
[300:30.26]That doesn't look good.
[300:33.58]Maybe I am being a little too hard on him.
[300:36.05]Here, take a bath and then eat one of these mint leaves.
[300:38.89]No, don't do that yet.
[300:39.95]Because I want to feed you this item.
[300:54.55]Lifespan decreased.
[300:55.57]No, I mean increasing his lifespan by giving him mint tea.
[300:59.31]Now we're going to throw him down to rest.
[301:02.87]Actually, I might let him rest for two days here.
[301:07.87]Devs in the chat?
[301:10.73]Devs in the chat?
[301:13.05]Put my tie on right!
[301:20.35]Nope.
[301:21.37]That would be a bad idea.
[301:26.15]I was gonna try to freeze frame it with my shirt coming up, but I think that'll get me in trouble.
[301:30.75]I was gonna, like, rip the shirt up and then go back, like, freeze frame.
[301:35.97]Alright, let's do power again.
[301:40.01]Hey Z-Man, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[301:46.79]I just wanna say that dogs are better than cats.
[301:48.83]I disagree.
[301:51.49]Uh, I wanna do power again.
[301:54.75]I want a heavy tech.
[302:00.73]And then we're going to do an official tournament.
[302:04.33]Hey, it's me, the Monster Rancher Dev.
[302:05.59]Holy shit, dude.
[302:06.23]What's up?
[302:10.16]New tech.
[302:10.58]Fuck.
[302:10.94]Usually you get it within the first two.
[302:19.56]Come on.
[302:21.78]Look at me, man.
[302:25.06]Dermot's a cat person?
[302:25.96]No, I'm a dog person.
[302:30.09]You know?
[302:31.24]I go by... I go by Ruffles.
[302:36.56]My character has long ears.
[302:39.22]I'm like blue and white.
[302:44.70]I'm a musician.
[302:47.32]New tech.
[302:48.06]Fuck.
[303:01.93]Okay, give me a monster that I can beat so I can get some money.
[303:08.68]Dark Cutter.
[303:09.50]Nope, this is the guy that turns into the drill and instantly kills you.
[303:12.34]So I'll be spamming Select right now.
[303:16.84]God, what the f- He missed me.
[303:20.62]Wow, what an unbelievable un-fucking-
[303:25.68]Unbelievable Irresponsible Irredeemable Unbelievable Irreplaceable Nice work.
[303:59.24]Focus on power and skill.
[304:01.97]You're refunding your sub.
[304:05.89]Don't do it.
[304:06.75]Please.
[304:08.75]You've been live for just over five hours.
[304:10.07]By this point in your broadcast, you should have consumed at least 20 ounces of water for optimum hydration.
[304:16.57]Oh.
[304:17.65]You mean this thing?
[304:20.65]How many ounces are in this?
[304:25.30]24!
[304:25.32]24 ounces of liquid is in this.
[304:28.72]This has been consumed over the stream.
[304:31.54]Judge, jury, executioner, fully hydrated.
[304:35.72]Absolutely hydrated.
[304:37.20]And I've eaten only like four or five shreds of paper, so I'm getting better at that.
[304:43.49]I've only consumed maybe four or five dryer sheets worth of paper this stream, so I'm okay.
[304:58.10]What's up with your hair, loser?
[305:02.44]That's old material!
[305:05.24]Stop doing old material!
[305:09.08]I told you guys I'm never cutting my hair ever again.
[305:11.10]Because everybody hates it so much.
[305:12.65]It's never getting cut.
[305:15.56]I'm gonna show up, and people at events are gonna be angry.
[305:17.64]If I ever do a cast or something, where I go to, let's say, an event, and, oh, I'm gonna do a cast, or I'm gonna appear on camera, and they're gonna ask me, Jerma, you're gonna be on camera for five to six hours, and we're gonna be cutting to you.
[305:32.97]There's gonna be probably hundreds of thousands of people watching.
[305:36.95]Get that disgusting thing off your head.
[305:39.11]And I'm gonna go, and walk away.
[305:59.84]You're overcompensating for being bald.
[306:01.68]I am not.
[306:03.22]How dare you make an accusation like that to me.
[306:05.84]Another mint leaf.
[306:09.57]I'm gonna feed him a mango, too.
[306:11.69]Yes, I am.
[306:12.65]Don't you tell me what I can and can't do to my own monster.
[306:17.31]This is gonna make him so happy.
[306:22.45]One loyalty increase.
[306:25.46]Oh, happy, happy, happy, happy times.
[306:27.76]Happy, happy, joy, joy.
[306:30.87]Take another mint leaf.
[306:37.51]See, he just prayed to me.
[306:40.71]Do I like mangoes in real life?
[306:42.27]Yeah, sure.
[306:43.17]Why not?
[306:49.72]Alright, so we got... What have we got for battle?
[306:52.30]I need money.
[306:54.08]I think I'm confident taking him here to C. This is the C cup.
[306:58.08]Star prune is the prize.
[306:59.16]3,000 gold.
[307:01.75]So that gives us today... How do I have stats right now?
[307:09.42]260 power.
[307:09.84]I think I'll be alright.
[307:10.88]I might be a little... Just rest for it.
[307:14.74]Sleep up.
[307:15.66]Let's try it.
[307:23.17]And I'm going to give him meat, too.
[307:36.63]He's never going to see what I said.
[307:37.69]Why wouldn't I?
[307:39.51]What did you say?
[307:43.27]40.
[307:43.47]Almost there.
[307:43.91]He likes to fight.
[307:49.42]Do it.
[307:56.34]I actually can't find how to donate to you.
[308:00.00]That's alright.
[308:03.56]Are you having fun?
[308:05.97]Namori, are you having fun?
[308:06.97]I hope so.
[308:14.38]Scroll up.
[308:14.76]Alright, I'm going to scroll up.
[308:15.65]Let's see what you say.
[308:16.25]He's never going to see what I said.
[308:19.75]Then scroll up.
[308:22.07]I don't know how... Jerma int is not his worst stat.
[308:24.64]Level it.
[308:26.17]Oh, and this character's defense gain is without a doubt one of the worst.
[308:29.81]Fucking, look at all these opinions!
[308:31.85]No, it's actually the worst!
[308:32.97]No, it's the best actually.
[308:59.34]I think we're just gonna do, we're just gonna get him leveled up with what we know, right?

[309:30.98]Sad.
[309:31.37]Needs to go on an expedition.
[309:32.33]Turns out power is the worst.
[309:33.41]Adrian, when do you think you'll be streaming Monster Rancher 3?
[309:35.43]Fact check.
[309:35.89]Stop reading chat.
[309:36.69]I'm bald.
[309:37.59]Kick Susfan.
[309:44.37]This guy will read anything.
[309:46.39]You hear that?
[309:47.01]He's fucking insane, dude.
[309:48.03]He'll read anything.
[309:48.75]You're right.
[309:51.17]Get it.
[309:53.03]We got good rolls this time.
[309:55.89]Although, he's getting them now, too.
[310:00.51]I don't want thwack.
[310:01.33]Take thwack off.
[310:02.17]Take thwack off.
[310:03.87]I don't want a thwack off.
[310:05.85]Take thwack off before you lose.
[310:07.85]Bowling ball him.
[310:09.64]Come on.
[310:10.36]Hail Mary bowling ball.
[310:14.22]Oh my god, really?
[310:17.58]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[310:19.10]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[310:21.68]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[310:26.08]Just fucking three times in a row.
[310:31.93]Oh, this... By the way, why... Never mind.
[310:51.43]Why did... Why was Thwack even on the menu?
[310:55.23]I wish I could just delete moves.
[310:56.69]I don't even want it on the bar.
[311:01.00]It's like fucking siphoned life in World of Warcraft Warlock.
[311:04.32]Take it off your bar, it's worthless.
[311:06.02]I don't even want it on my bar.
[311:13.78]Now look, I'm gonna beat everybody else now.
[311:16.06]And I'm gonna lose the fucking tournament.
[311:25.00]21%, what the hell was that all about?
[311:27.44]Holy shit, this is bad.
[311:38.56]I'm gonna have to switch this up here.
[311:39.72]Actually, the guy might need to use the whack now.
[311:51.27]No, stab is better.
[311:55.07]Sorry, you can't do anything.
[312:00.34]No, stab is just the highest percentage of everything I have.
[312:08.35]I have such terrible... Somehow I made it out of this one.
[312:13.00]Well, just put on a show for him.
[312:25.18]During life has probably been buffed since I played it.
[312:27.14]Yeah, probably.
[312:30.74]You can delete moves in Pokemon.
[312:34.32]Yeah.
[312:34.48]Yeah.
[312:37.48]But Pokemon is... I just don't like the small screen, you know?
[312:44.49]I wish they would make a fully fledged out Pokemon game for one of their consoles.
[312:50.86]They've done a couple of offshoots, right?
[312:52.40]They've done like Pokemon Stadium and Pokemon Picture Party.
[312:57.41]But, they need to make a fully fleshed out, like, Switch Pokemon.
[313:02.81]And maybe I would play it.
[313:03.69]I just don't want this small screen.
[313:05.60]It gives me eye anxiety.
[313:07.68]You know what I'm saying?
[313:08.42]Alright, it's got high speed, high skill, terrible defense.
[313:11.38]Just have to stab him five times in the face.
[313:15.56]Get in there.
[313:17.78]Get right up in his face.
[313:25.59]No, he's trying to kick me away.
[313:27.95]He's not doing any damage.
[313:30.60]I just hit him a few times.
[313:33.76]Yeah, this guy sucks.
[313:34.98]I just can't get terrible RNG here.
[313:40.89]Only do stabs.
[313:41.55]No reason to do anything else.
[313:42.51]His speed is too high to even attempt anything else.
[313:45.63]Up there.
[313:55.05]Somebody decided to actually level this stupid thing up.
[313:58.05]That's what's funny to me more than anything else.
[313:59.61]You suck, dude.
[314:10.14]Then again, my guy.
[314:10.96]Come on.
[314:12.88]Watch me get hit by something crazy here at the end and blow it.
[314:16.64]No, that's it.
[314:17.32]Good.
[314:21.80]Pokemon Colosseum for Nintendo GameCube as well as its sequel, Pokemon XD.
[314:26.49]For the same console.
[314:27.21]They're both very fleshed out.
[314:28.23]Very well made Pokemon games on console.
[314:32.93]They did.
[314:35.13]Interesting.
[314:38.41]Interesting.
[314:39.11]Come on, beat them.
[314:41.59]Alright, there we go.
[314:42.95]I can now still win the tournament.
[314:43.99]I have to beat Sussfan again.
[314:46.17]Or I have to actually beat more than one.
[314:49.36]I gotta beat Huel.
[314:51.04]I gotta beat this guy.
[314:52.12]And that's it.
[314:52.86]And then we win the tournament.
[314:55.08]Good.
[314:57.36]Pokemon GameCube games?
[314:58.42]It feels like the GameCube games... All the first-party Nintendo GameCube games, I feel like were the best.
[315:04.19]Out of any of their console generations.
[315:06.17]Wrong or disagree?
[315:08.89]You know?
[315:10.57]Wrong or do you disagree?
[315:14.94]That looked way more damaging than it actually was.
[315:20.50]I can't do anything else besides stab.
[315:22.78]I have to land it.
[315:30.31]There's nothing I can do about it.
[315:31.79]I just have to hit it.
[315:35.33]Just need to get lucky.
[315:39.03]There it is.
[315:39.87]Get lucky again.
[315:44.15]Smoke breath.
[315:47.41]Come on.
[315:48.18]Do it.
[315:50.42]Didn't even want to do that move!
[315:53.62]There it is.
[315:54.52]Oh, beautiful.
[315:55.54]Absolutely perfect.
[315:56.28]Alright, now just... Fuck with him.
[315:59.47]Don't go back that far.
[316:00.21]Don't get breathed on.
[316:03.57]Spam it.
[316:03.97]Spam.
[316:04.69]No, don't spam.
[316:05.51]Get him.
[316:10.03]Just don't hit me with something fucking crazy right now, please.
[316:12.92]Good.
[316:13.34]I win.
[316:16.92]Five hour stream.
[316:17.56]We're going longer than that.
[316:24.88]I need to get somebody up to a certain level here.
[316:27.64]You know what I'm saying?
[316:36.43]24 hour stream.
[316:37.05]Not that long.
[316:41.20]Look how many stats I gained if I won this tournament.
[316:49.74]Making some money.
[316:50.48]Good.
[316:51.24]3300 bucks.
[316:51.64]Needed that bad.
[316:58.68]You sent me a thousand bits and I didn't even see it.
[317:03.67]If you are new, if you are here, I usually don't... No, change in fame?
[317:07.39]How?
[317:07.67]I beat everybody.
[317:11.09]Thank you, Nomori, for the 10 bucks.
[317:12.45]I appreciate it, man.
[317:14.13]I typically wait till the end of the stream to do all the bits and subs and donation readings and stuff.
[317:21.67]That's typically how I do it these days.
[317:24.11]But I do appreciate it, though.
[317:25.73]Thank you so much.
[317:28.43]My friend bet me 20 burger boy bucks I wouldn't lick the pole you hold onto on a carousel.
[317:33.44]He owes me 20 burger boy bucks.
[317:34.80]Please go on the official podcast.
[317:36.92]Why would you do that?
[317:39.36]Holy shit, that's a lot of stats.
[317:40.94]Win more tournaments, Jeremy.
[317:44.84]He did a great job.
[317:45.40]Yes, we're going to praise him because we're being strict, but we're going to... Strict?
[317:50.78]But fair, right?
[317:53.30]41, even.
[317:54.18]Doing well.
[317:55.06]Things are looking good for this guy.
[317:58.68]Stats are evening out a little bit.
[318:00.50]Defense could use a little work.
[318:04.78]So, we're going to... When's the next battle?
[318:07.42]D... No, we can't... No, let's... Let's train him.
[318:13.82]Rest up.
[318:14.74]Send him to air entry.
[318:15.76]Power again.
[318:23.54]He's doing well.
[318:24.14]Get that up to 44.
[318:25.04]Good.
[318:25.48]Nice work.
[318:27.56]Training...
[318:28.57]Errantry.
[318:30.61]Power again.
[318:35.97]I want to learn a heavy technique.
[318:41.57]Save it right now.
[318:42.15]We'll save it after this.
[318:48.04]I'm really into this game.
[318:48.88]This game's really fun.
[318:50.00]It really is.
[318:53.50]Power, and then we're going to do skill when we get Errantry here.
[318:59.88]Give me that new skill.
[319:00.70]God damn it.
[319:01.60]New tech.
[319:02.58]Do this without any problems.
[319:04.02]Yes.
[319:04.22]New tech.
[319:04.84]Come on.
[319:05.36]New tech.
[319:05.88]Damn it.
[319:35.19]I really want a heavy tech with this guy.
[319:43.29]Don't do any more E rank?
[319:44.43]Nah, I won't after this.
[319:46.89]We can beat Hellwall.
[319:47.75]Hellwall's a chump.
[319:50.31]As long as we just don't get hit by him much.
[319:51.73]I mean, I'm not controlling him, but... I think we can beat Hellwall.
[319:56.99]I say... Oh, come on.
[319:59.79]I say that every time, and he starts off every single time.
[320:04.15]I can do it.
[320:04.85]Just get in there.
[320:06.27]Don't let him crush you again.
[320:08.01]If I get hit by that fucking smash one more time, it's over.
[320:10.96]There we go.
[320:12.00]Couple more times.
[320:12.68]You're good.
[320:14.40]No, don't.
[320:15.00]Seriously, dude.
[320:16.40]Don't do that.
[320:17.30]Beat him.
[320:17.78]I can beat this.
[320:19.04]I know I can.
[320:20.28]Just do that one more time and win.
[320:22.54]Right now.
[320:24.48]Why would you do that?
[320:25.43]That's one of your lowest... I wouldn't have done that.
[320:28.85]Stab.
[320:29.89]Go for the stab.
[320:32.03]I'm backing him out.
[320:33.13]He's doing it wrong.
[320:37.11]Do your last shot.
[320:38.11]Get it right.
[320:40.33]Get it right!
[320:42.15]Last chance.
[320:44.87]Oh, buddy, you're in big trouble if you don't do this right.
[320:47.49]Do it!
[320:49.63]You have la- five- Pull him out.
[320:50.45]No.
[320:51.82]See?
[320:51.92]NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
[321:09.75]Hearing the sirens from the ambulance.
[321:16.13]I don't know why he keeps doing this stupid bowling ball fire.
[321:19.69]It's like a 27% chance to hit and I have no intelligence.
[321:22.47]Why would you use it?
[321:26.95]I'm gonna make $1,000 from that, so that's good.
[321:30.52]We pretty much just got the sale for doing this.
[321:34.02]And we raised our power by like 20, 25, 30.
[321:36.52]Yeah, he loses a bunch of guts.
[321:51.93]Local ice cream streamer dies in the desert.
[321:58.08]Oh, yes, the prize money.
[321:59.40]Here you go.
[322:01.12]It's pretty much 50% off.
[322:02.20]Mr. Ice Cream defeated a wild monster.
[322:05.72]It's a wonderful... It could not acquire any techniques, but it was pretty successful.
[322:08.60]Praise him.
[322:11.94]Now, for the first time ever, can I please be over, like, 50 loyalty?
[322:18.08]42.
[322:18.36]Let him rest.
[322:19.16]Give him a mint leaf.
[322:20.86]I need to buy more mint leaves.
[322:31.56]Official tournament.
[322:34.37]Um, he seems tired.
[322:35.71]Let him sleep again.
[322:36.43]Mint leaf.
[322:38.31]Are we having fun, guys?
[322:40.89]Okay.
[322:41.57]File, save.
[323:02.44]It's half past five in the morning here.
[323:04.08]Oh, damn.
[323:07.82]Yeah, so a lot of you EU guys are going late here, but... I'm still sticking around for a little while longer.
[323:14.02]At least a while.
[323:15.28]I don't know how long we'll go for into the night here, but... Here we go.
[323:22.91]What's the next tournament?
[323:23.77]Do we get a C tournament right here?
[323:24.99]It's the official cup.
[323:26.83]I think he's ready to...
[323:29.72]I think he's ready to move up to C, just to kind of farm C and then go to B eventually.
[323:34.15]8 Entrance.
[323:35.43]What have I got for 41 Loyalty?
[323:38.93]How am I doing?
[323:42.79]I'm done being tired.
[323:43.77]I wonder what I should do here.
[323:50.01]Maybe just... Yeah, I'm going to rest.
[323:54.73]We'll do the next official C tournament we're going to do.
[324:05.11]And I am going to give meat.
[324:06.89]No, I'm not.
[324:07.39]Because that's... I don't want to be... Because that might spoil him, and I want him to stay even.
[324:15.70]How long is the plan to stream?
[324:18.02]I would probably realistically say at least the next two hours.
[324:23.26]If I was to be realistic about it.
[324:24.41]He's two years old.
[324:26.87]Happy birthday.
[324:39.37]And then once we get there, we'll see how I feel.
[324:42.55]Maybe we might go even more.
[324:44.13]I don't know.
[324:46.53]I'm feeling good.
[324:47.49]I'm good and I'm up.
[324:48.58]I'm having a decent time.
[324:51.54]I'm totally okay with streaming for like 8 to 10 hours if need be.
[324:54.38]Or if I feel like it, if I want to.
[325:01.78]That is true.
[325:02.98]Also, another reason why I want to go a little bit long is because...
[325:07.65]We're supposed to be getting... Hey, what's that?
[325:10.50]Another extreme weather condition?
[325:12.90]Awful snowstorm?
[325:13.86]Again?
[325:15.38]So, it's not against the realm of possibilities that I might lose power again for, like, two days.
[325:21.20]It's very possible, because it's happened the last two times we've had any storm.
[325:30.31]And we get to do another air entry for free, hopefully, right now.
[325:36.65]Oh, that's okay.
[325:37.19]I'm gonna buy some more mint leaves.
[325:41.03]Yeah, snow and spring.
[325:42.11]It's unbelievable.
[325:44.41]It's totally unbelievable.
[325:50.65]Maybe, um... I'm gonna get some... I'm gonna get candy.
[325:56.35]Does he like candy?
[325:58.83]Buy, like, another few mint leaves.
[326:05.32]Okay, I have as many as I can... What about selling stuff?
[326:10.12]Is it time to sell one of these dumb things that I'm never going to use?
[326:15.46]Zoom's disc.
[326:16.95]Kato's disc.
[326:20.91]Gel's disc.
[326:21.67]I have a lot of these discs.
[326:28.19]So this Gemini's pot... Anybody want to give me some insight on this one?
[326:37.72]This is 1500 bucks.
[326:41.66]I mean, is it worth holding on to?
[326:44.38]Can I combine it with somebody?
[326:46.52]Does it just increase stats?
[326:47.76]Is it a seasoning?
[326:49.24]Is it worth holding on to?
[326:56.26]Since by the time it starts to take effect, you're already losing lifespan.
[326:59.57]One in a tournament.
[327:03.03]Apparently, it reduces stress somehow.
[327:05.95]Passive stress reduction, according to Potion Salad.
[327:14.02]Passive stress reduction.
[327:15.04]It's not as good as Sculpture, so you can toss it, honestly.
[327:17.54]It's a held item.
[327:22.16]I mean, is it worth having the shitty stress reduction, or is it worth getting $1500?
[327:29.38]Is it totally negligible, or is it take $1,500 for free?
[327:38.14]He uses decor.
[327:41.34]Yeah, let's... Alright, let's just get rid of it then.
[327:43.06]If I can just get some more money, then why not?
[327:45.20]That's another training regimen.
[327:51.06]Alright.
[327:51.64]Sayonara.
[327:52.34]Sell.
[327:53.14]And...
[327:58.89]I think I'm gonna take the star prune.
[328:01.29]Does that drop my lifespan or my loyalty or something if I make him take the star prune?
[328:08.69]Let's see, turn him up here.
[328:11.83]Alright, let's, uh... Let's leave it there.
[328:19.92]Good idea.
[328:24.84]So it spoils him.
[328:25.38]So I should probably get, like, buy a snake.
[328:31.53]So, spoil him with the fame and then make him eat a snake.
[328:36.67]Now we need to get ready for... not this one.
[328:48.88]I will do this one here.
[328:51.96]Because it's 3000.
[328:52.48]I guess I could just do this too.
[329:02.09]um I'm done I'm gonna do it let's do another entry here why not I wonder if I should scale I'll just scale this time now it's either this or I do the battle
[329:30.68]Alright, no, I bought mints.
[329:31.58]I got the, I bought mints.
[329:33.60]I'm gonna rest him again.
[329:41.19]I'm gonna do, yeah, I'll do a d-errantry.
[329:43.05]Alright, training.
[329:48.91]Errantry.
[329:49.45]I'm gonna do skill.
[329:53.67]Skill, and we're gonna do a d-monster.
[329:56.17]There's a chance to get a new technique.
[330:01.36]Monster is gonna be... You know who it is.
[330:05.24]It's your good buddy, Nordy!
[330:16.08]Watermelon.
[330:17.16]Success!
[330:18.78]New tech.
[330:20.54]Seems like every time I do skill, I get a new tech.
[330:27.16]Good.
[330:28.61]Good.
[330:29.67]Get it up there.
[330:33.17]Hungry Shack.
[330:35.56]Good.
[330:40.80]And Crabs.
[330:44.10]Good.
[330:47.74]Did I get any fight?
[330:48.99]Or is that it?
[330:53.41]Give me a random fight so I can get paid.
[330:55.57]So it turns out to be free.
[330:56.81]Or like 40% off.
[331:03.93]Yeah, versus... Versus Tachi.
[331:10.17]The defense and the life... Eh, should be fine.
[331:14.09]Kick his ass.
[331:17.40]Use that new skill you just got.
[331:18.58]Let's see if we can get a sneak peek.
[331:22.88]Give us a sneak peek, man.
[331:29.26]There it is.
[331:29.70]I don't know what it is, but it looked kind of cool.
[331:33.16]Fingernail extension.
[331:38.65]There's no timer.
[331:41.71]I don't want to back out because it's just free money.
[331:52.30]Oh my god, Edgemon.
[331:56.56]Edgemon just gave 50 fucking bucks.
[332:01.57]This is the most boring fight ever, by the way.
[332:03.39]Thank you, Edgemont, for the 5000 bits, dude.
[332:07.21]Finally.
[332:08.45]That's pretty good.
[332:11.29]Taloc said that if you're not able to play a way out this Friday, it's all your fault.
[332:15.65]I'm preemptively blaming you if the inclement weather prevents you from playing this Friday, LUL.
[332:23.42]That's... That sucks.
[332:26.93]Me and Italics have been looking forward to A Way Out for... like a year now.
[332:33.20]I can't wait to play that game.
[332:34.84]And if there's, like, snow issues and I can't do anything, I'm gonna be so sad.
[332:38.82]I would really like it if I could beat this stupid fucking gremlin monster, please.
[332:44.23]Like, do I have to back you out, or are you not gonna do anything?
[332:48.01]Just hit him with... just do the good moves that you know you can do.
[332:52.83]You can't be serious.
[332:53.77]You're gonna lose to this guy.
[332:58.65]How do you miss all this stuff?
[332:59.87]Come on.
[333:00.75]The speed is too high.
[333:02.23]I'm gonna pull out here.
[333:07.19]Buy a generator?
[333:08.15]Um, I can't power the internet with a generator.
[333:15.74]Do you want me to, like, call up Comcast and be like, Hey, I know you're, like, down in the whole area, but I got a generator, so just, like, plug into my generator and just run the whole town off of it.
[333:29.48]Okay, that's it.
[333:30.88]That's it.
[333:31.78]Call him out.
[333:32.76]That's it.
[333:34.05]Yank him.
[333:34.91]Goodbye.
[333:35.97]Throw the towel in here.
[333:37.07]Give me a break.
[333:42.89]Mobile hotspot.
[333:44.55]Yeah.
[333:45.59]On my dumpy little 3G network.
[333:53.76]How bad is the storm?
[333:55.10]Two feet.
[333:55.58]It's not the snow.
[333:56.20]It's the wind that's been causing all the problems.
[334:00.22]There's been plenty of storms that have had 10, 20 inches of snow around here, but we've been having this crazy, ridiculous 60 mile per hour gusts of wind that just taken down trees.
[334:13.63]It's been like this for the last three weeks.
[334:15.37]Every week for the last like three weeks, we've had 50, 60, 70 mile per hour wind gusts that just take down whole lines.
[334:22.93]It's insane.
[334:30.87]Underground cables?
[334:31.73]I know, right?
[334:32.57]You would assume that, but... I wish.
[334:42.29]He's defeated by a wild monster, but it acquired a new technique.
[334:44.91]It seems pretty strong.
[334:45.85]Praise it.
[334:48.01]Yes.
[334:54.91]Give him some rest.
[334:56.37]Even.
[334:56.59]48.
[334:57.73]Rest up.
[334:58.69]Let's take a look at what the new tactic is.
[335:01.18]Okay, belly punch, pierce.
[335:07.66]Okay, so... It's... It's the same move, essentially, as stab.
[335:16.26]The only difference is it drains more guts.
[335:21.53]costs a little more, drains more.
[335:23.42]Same hit and same damage, though.
[335:26.04]I don't know how useful this is going to be.
[335:30.24]If this was a... like a C for force, maybe, I would use it a lot, but this is still fine.
[335:50.00]Do I have any moves that are higher than C for Force?
[335:51.98]This is the only one I have, which is Tail Assault, but it's hard to hit.
[335:54.02]I don't know.
[335:57.46]It's useful it's a second rank and not the first.
[336:01.14]Yeah.
[336:03.16]This is true.
[336:04.12]I'll give it a try.
[336:06.98]Have a roast.
[336:16.86]It's got longer range and better hit percentage.
[336:18.54]Yeah.
[336:21.68]That's a nice backflip.
[336:34.61]So.
[336:37.57]Battle.
[336:38.31]No, not rest.
[336:39.97]Battle.
[336:42.69]We have a sea battle here.
[336:44.13]Let's do it.
[336:45.49]We want to constantly be fighting with this dude.
[336:50.40]10 hour stream, really?
[336:51.24]Yes.
[336:53.62]This is probably going to be very, very long.
[336:55.92]Because I'm just chilling, playing this game.
[336:57.70]It's fun.
[336:59.20]Plus, considering that if I can't stream in the next couple days, then here's like a double stream in case I can't stream tomorrow night or Wednesday night or something, whatever it is.
[337:22.68]No, I'm having... I'm fine.
[337:24.22]I'm good.
[337:25.88]I'm not that, like, tired.
[337:26.84]I'm good.
[337:29.30]If I was getting tired, if I was getting hungry, tired, you know, I would probably... I would leave.
[337:33.17]I'd say I'm done.
[337:35.37]Alright, let's try the new technique.
[337:39.71]It's the same guy again.
[337:48.33]But I've... My intelligence...
[337:50.53]I probably should do the int move, but I'm not going to hit it very often.
[337:52.97]Although, now I'm better.
[337:55.41]He has higher hit percentage, but I have... Everything else is better for me.
[337:58.67]I just need to land these moves.
[338:00.91]Honest to God.
[338:03.88]Let's put the new one on.
[338:05.08]Let's try Pierce.
[338:10.02]Worth a shot.
[338:13.36]Good.
[338:14.72]Follow it up with a stab.
[338:15.88]Pull it back.
[338:17.04]Bowling ball.
[338:19.19]That was a good strat.
[338:20.47]I like that.
[338:22.86]Hang back.
[338:23.26]You can't do anything.
[338:25.04]Now, at this point, because this guy's giving me so much trouble, I think it's time to... dump him out.
[338:29.84]Back it up.
[338:31.12]I think I'm just gonna stay back and bowling ball.
[338:32.64]That's the technique here.
[338:36.90]If I don't get it, then I'm just gonna try to push him out.
[338:38.65]Push him away.
[338:39.07]Thank you.
[338:41.51]Bowling ball.
[338:47.05]Okay, now I can't do that technique.
[338:48.85]Now I have to actually hit him with something else.
[338:55.59]Stay back.
[339:02.21]Really was hoping at least one of these was gonna hit.
[339:05.01]Still one.
[339:11.50]I beat my arch nemesis.
[339:16.07]How much power does this guy have?
[339:17.35]Pretty similar, like 290 something?
[339:18.33]That's how you know we're making progress, when I can beat the guy that I lost to every time.
[339:27.75]Mr. Ice Cream.
[339:41.67]Am I going to be a Monster Ratcher expert by the time you play 3?
[339:44.59]I don't know.
[339:44.95]I feel like there's a lot of new mechanics in every one of these games that are very cryptic and hard to understand.
[339:50.36]So, I'm sure it'll be pretty similar.
[339:52.58]Maybe.
[339:53.08]Alright, hold on.
[339:53.64]This is the Garfield guy.
[339:55.72]Stay away from his intelligence moves.
[339:58.50]His power's not good.
[340:00.34]Yeah.
[340:00.70]Just get away from his int moves.
[340:01.98]So that means I have to stay close.
[340:05.66]Or just... Thank goodness.
[340:06.66]Let's go for the pierce and stay in this area.
[340:11.45]If I stick around here, he's not going to be able to do anything.
[340:17.43]Great, really.
[340:20.45]Right there, wait until it's a little bit higher.
[340:22.31]Yeah, I'm going to change the move out.
[340:38.88]Pierce is the best one.
[340:43.92]Stay here.
[340:44.70]Stab!
[340:45.96]Stab him again!
[340:49.90]Wow, that could have been bad.
[340:53.24]Get in close and stab him.
[340:57.82]Come on.
[340:58.38]I need to KO him.
[340:59.68]There we go.
[341:01.86]Get Edward scissorhandsed.
[341:07.98]Yeah, he's got grit.
[341:09.24]Not enough for a double tap, though.
[341:17.41]I feel like we're gonna get this guy to A rank.
[341:19.35]I do.
[341:20.97]I do feel like this guy's gonna get to a position where we can see the end... slightly end-game monster content at like A rank.
[341:30.41]At least I hope so, I could be completely wrong.
[341:37.65]3 is a weird game, but truthfully it's my favorite.
[341:39.31]I'm not sure how well it will translate to streaming, but we'll see.
[341:41.75]I mean, aren't they all kind of in the same realm?
[341:45.51]They're all pretty similar games, aren't they?
[341:51.82]Aren't they all very similar?
[341:54.44]Give that stab.
[342:02.37]Alright, back it up.
[342:03.85]Let him eat a dumb banana.
[342:10.38]Meringue.
[342:12.50]You know what?
[342:12.78]I'm going to stick... I don't want him to do the banana.
[342:15.08]Because the banana heals him to full health.
[342:16.72]And I know I'll get screwed here now.
[342:19.24]The one time this guy eats the banana here, he'll win.
[342:22.83]So make it so he has to throw the boomerang.
[342:25.53]Stay in the thirds there.
[342:26.53]Let's do it again.
[342:32.67]We have advantage.
[342:36.82]Because this doesn't hurt very much.
[342:38.62]Even if it hits, it sucks.
[342:46.77]Yeah, he's done.
[342:49.93]Tournament 1!
[343:00.70]Thank you, Zamanreal!
[343:02.56]Zmanreal78 for the $15.
[343:03.52]Well, thanks for sticking around, man.
[343:04.46]Hope you feel better.
[343:18.76]Welcome to Twitch, not TV.
[343:21.96]1500 Bitcoins.
[343:27.46]Speaking of Bitcoins, you guys know I have the Ethereum address down there, right?
[343:33.82]It's probably getting removed.
[343:38.18]I'm probably going to remove that Ethereum address.
[343:40.76]Because it's only been used one time and it was like $5.
[343:45.82]Somebody gave me $5 in Ethereum like three months ago.
[343:51.77]I figured, I don't know, it's like currently an in-topic thing.
[343:54.27]People are talking about it.
[343:55.45]I think it's cool.
[343:56.17]I'm really into it.
[343:56.83]I like it.
[343:57.45]I'm interested in it.
[344:00.03]But nobody's using it, so it's probably going to go away.
[344:06.64]We know.
[344:07.76]Yeah, we get it, Jeremy.
[344:14.32]No, that's hilarious.
[344:15.95]No, you can go look it up.
[344:17.53]Go look it up on Etherscan if you want.
[344:19.73]You can go look at that address up on Etherscan.
[344:23.11]It's received like $4.18.
[344:24.35]Like three months, like two months ago, whatever it was.
[344:30.46]Totally immutable public ledger.
[344:32.00]You can see everything.
[344:41.76]Streamer begs for cryptocurrency.
[344:44.63]No, I'm just saying that somebody brought up... We brought up the Bitcoin thing, and I'm like, eh, it's probably time to say that that's probably going away soon here.
[344:58.39]Uh, we're not gonna praise him.
[345:06.52]He's tired at 47.
[345:08.50]We have a lot of fame, too, now.
[345:10.84]Rest, and then a meet you.
[345:16.79]Where can I send you hate mail?
[345:18.53]Um...
[345:20.65]Write it out.
[345:21.87]Write the whole thing out.
[345:23.35]Get real deeply hateful.
[345:26.73]Make it like 25 pages long.
[345:29.23]Talk about like, Jeremy, you're the fucking worst.
[345:31.56]Nothing you do is cool.
[345:32.60]I hate everything about you.
[345:34.30]Put tons of work into it.
[345:36.62]Seal it up in an envelope.
[345:38.56]And then shove it up your ass.
[345:59.07]Oh, Mortylicious is real now.
[346:04.73]But how... But how will it get to you if it's up his ass?
[346:16.78]I love that.
[346:20.12]That's great.
[346:21.97]No, you can send me hate mail.
[346:22.91]Just send it right here.
[346:23.69]Put it in the chat box.
[346:28.71]More rest.
[346:35.71]Send me like a twitch... No, never mind.
[346:39.26]I'm not going to say that.
[346:39.98]50 loyalty.
[346:41.28]We're almost ready to do an expedition to get some stuff.
[346:45.74]I think it's time to do another errantry.
[346:49.20]This is official, right?
[346:50.22]No, we're not going to do an errantry unless it's cheap.
[346:51.94]So we're going to train defense here.
[346:54.00]I'm going to do a...
[346:57.77]We're going to do this one.
[346:58.35]We're going to drop intelligence.
[346:59.31]Who gives a shit?
[347:00.12]We're not even focusing on it.
[347:01.14]I know people tell me it's a good stat, but we're already setting our ways here.
[347:12.26]52 loyalty.
[347:13.04]Bingo.
[347:15.43]We got one.
[347:16.69]Do you want to let... No, no, no.
[347:17.73]Let me see.
[347:18.27]What's that one?
[347:19.03]All right.
[347:20.23]We're going to rest today.
[347:21.03]We're going to do the official C tournament.
[347:23.15]Kick some ass.
[347:25.65]And make it happen.
[347:37.99]Mints do not increase life.
[347:41.79]Uh, yeah, I'm just trying to keep his stress down.
[347:43.46]This is the first time we've ever gone past 50 loyalty, so I'm trying to keep it as cool and collected as I can.
[347:49.64]C tournament.
[347:52.12]Eight entrance.
[347:53.12]Let's make it happen.
[347:55.64]Wait, what?
[347:58.26]This is a higher grade tourney.
[348:00.89]Dare you participate.
[348:01.87]Why is it saying that?
[348:03.21]I just did a C cup and won.
[348:12.22]Jeremy take your defense drills put them in an envelope and shove them up your ass Never did the official wait.
[348:27.71]I never did the official D cup.
[348:29.41]Oh Oh
[348:35.69]Oh, whoa.
[348:36.73]Do I get more money?
[348:37.75]Okay, do I skip a generation?
[348:39.77]If I skip a grade, do I get something cool for that?
[348:42.89]Or is it just do D and then do C?
[348:49.72]We'll do it.
[348:51.00]I want as many fights as I can with this guy.
[348:57.65]You keep trying to skip official cups.
[348:59.23]Damn.
[348:59.87]I mean, I'm not trying to.
[349:00.73]I'm just trying to
[349:03.52]The problem with the official cups is once you do them, if you go backwards, you lose fame.
[349:08.25]And it took me a long time to figure that out.
[349:10.87]And play around it.
[349:17.39]It's one less tournament.
[349:18.29]Yeah, well, let's just kick... Everyone's gonna fucking run away from here anyways.
[349:21.22]They are gonna be scared of me.
[349:23.08]Oh, he's not.
[349:23.54]Okay, that's fine.
[349:33.25]I don't think you can skip crates.
[349:35.54]Well, this is, uh... This is gonna be fun.
[349:43.24]I got really high loyalty.
[349:44.50]Come on.
[349:45.14]Don't do me like that.
[349:52.61]Waste it all.
[349:55.93]Beautiful stab.
[349:57.53]Speaking of stabs, stick it to him.
[350:01.50]See if I can flawless this guy.
[350:02.64]That'd be nice.
[350:05.00]Sign on.
[350:07.98]Smurfing?
[350:08.40]I'm not smurfing.
[350:10.16]I'm in the same... I just got held back like five years.
[350:16.15]I'm 18 in the fourth grade.
[350:19.85]I just couldn't do it.
[350:20.87]I couldn't figure it out.
[350:21.83]I got held back like nine years.
[350:36.59]I bought another copy of the game to smurf.
[350:39.12]Where do we get one of those dogs?
[350:40.44]I want to train one.
[350:52.15]First five, then nine.
[350:53.75]Which is it?
[350:54.15]Wait, what do you mean?
[350:54.83]What did I say?
[350:55.25]What are you talking about?
[350:57.89]What's my IQ again? 124.
[351:03.32]Don't believe anybody in the chat that's telling you, like, I took a shitty, goofy online flash game quiz that took 20 minutes.
[351:09.53]124.
[351:11.55]124 fucking IQ plays.
[351:20.82]Hey, just like my video game license, I can prove that, you know.
[351:24.24]I actually have that document.
[351:26.64]I can prove that.
[351:28.18]I can go and get that document that shows it.
[351:32.04]from a licensed reputable organization, like Blockbuster when I got my gamer license, I showed you that.
[351:47.03]Prove it, do it.
[351:52.75]Release those tax returns.
[351:56.03]Oh, no, no, I have the plaque too.
[352:00.05]So if you want to see my gamer license and the plaque, I have the plaque.
[352:07.72]My Blockbuster Video Game Champion plaque is up in my closet up there.
[352:21.02]Show it.
[352:21.86]Actually, the glass is broken on it, so it's kind of funny.
[352:24.14]It looks like kind of fucked up.
[352:26.93]I'll go get it.
[352:28.47]After this battle, I'll go get them.
[352:29.99]Yeah, I'll go get it.
[352:30.51]I swear to God.
[352:32.71]Where is my game license?
[352:33.67]Where did I put it?
[352:35.33]I got them both.
[352:36.79]Just so we can, you know, stay completely transparent here.
[352:41.02]Those of you that don't know, this is for real.
[352:42.92]This is not a joke.
[352:43.70]I'm not making a comedy routine here.
[352:46.60]I am a blockbuster video game champion.
[352:49.40]I did it when I was fucking like 10 years old or something.
[352:53.28]I was like less than 10 years old and I actually have the documented proof, I have it in my hand right now.
[353:05.49]Come on, get it, get it.
[353:08.49]I was gonna have the gamer license on you, what if I get pulled over by the game police?
[353:19.00]I'm playing... I'm currently... I'm licensed to play this game, so I'm going to continue to play it for a little bit.
[353:25.72]I'll get him in a second.
[353:31.44]Let's back up.
[353:35.53]That's not what I wanted to have happen.
[353:36.59]I don't know why I was backing up that far.
[353:39.09]He just ripped up my... There he is.
[353:44.07]See you later.
[353:53.68]I'll get it now.
[353:54.52]It's right upstairs.
[353:55.66]Just give me one second.
[353:58.20]Look, I will prove the whole thing.
[354:01.47]Immutable, irreputable proof.
[354:04.32]One second.
[355:33.49]Let me take a look.
[355:40.47]Okay, so, if you don't know, if you're unaware of this, back when I, in 1995, so this is 1995, when I was a kid, I beat a bunch of adults in a video game championship at Blockbuster.
[355:54.50]I'm a Blockbuster video game champion, an actual champion, actual real Blockbuster champion.
[355:58.54]Let's show it.
[356:00.02]So let's go ahead and read this out loud.
[356:08.63]1995 Store Champion.
[356:10.73]This certificate is awarded to... Jeremy.
[356:15.70]You're not gonna get my last name.
[356:17.42]Whatever.
[356:18.08]I think I give a fuck.
[356:20.24]Who has mastered the competition to earn the title of Store Champion.
[356:24.34]Super NES format.
[356:28.76]Here's the card.
[356:29.38]There's the champion's card.
[356:34.45]There it is.
[356:35.15]This is real.
[356:36.61]Take a look at the back.
[356:37.53]Does the store ever- I mean, I don't want to tell you the store, because obviously that's- There I am.
[356:42.67]That's my name.
[356:44.56]See?
[356:46.22]And what's this?
[356:47.38]Oh!
[356:48.22]Oh, wow!
[356:49.26]Would you look at that!
[356:50.10]1995 Store Champion!
[356:54.00]Store Champion 1995, Super NES format, fucking real!
[357:12.09]I actually have the proof to back it up.
[357:16.04]Look at that.
[357:20.54]Real.
[357:28.07]I ripped it, I got ya.
[357:35.32]As if people don't know it already, whatever.
[357:50.72]Everybody's already known him for like fucking seven years.
[357:55.55]Please don't kill me.
[358:04.93]Elbertson exposed.
[358:06.19]That is my actual fucking birth name.
[358:08.67]It's Elbertson.
[358:18.02]I could print that in four minutes?
[358:19.66]No you could not!
[358:21.02]Go get it!
[358:28.17]You bought one of these for four dollars?
[358:30.03]I'm sorry.
[358:30.73]That's a laminated card.
[358:32.43]You can't fucking forge that.
[358:47.03]The paper's too thick.
[358:48.35]What are you fucking talking about?
[358:52.87]How do I, how do I forge this thing?
[358:56.39]You know what I'm saying?
[358:57.67]Like, look at this thing.
[358:59.57]This is a, it's laminated.
[359:01.67]You think I just like printed this?
[359:04.13]It's got a barcode on it.
[359:05.27]I don't know what happens if you scan it.
[359:06.71]I don't need to prove anything.
[359:10.71]I, I, look, you think my like fucking blockbuster birth certificate isn't real?
[359:21.79]Now let's kick this guy's ass.
[359:29.57]Scan it.
[359:31.90]What do you mean?
[359:32.96]I'm not gonna scan it on screen.
[359:34.36]I'm not gonna scan my Blockbuster Burst certificate on screen.
[359:37.08]Sorry, that's not gonna happen.
[359:45.68]I was born in a Blockbuster.
[359:50.43]Now we gotta pull back here.
[359:51.69]Let me get one more hit.
[359:53.71]70%.
[359:53.73]Give me a break.
[359:54.29]Pull back.
[360:00.84]Alright, I got it.
[360:01.78]That's what I wanted.
[360:02.48]Stay back.
[360:06.10]Stay back!
[360:07.92]Don't lose this here.
[360:08.72]There's no reason to.
[360:18.72]No, I got free rentals.
[360:19.98]I got two free rentals a month for a year.
[360:26.01]It's a Pokemon card protector.
[360:27.87]Fuck.
[360:34.46]Why are you trying to prove an invalid achievement from 1995 when Blockbuster doesn't exist anymore?
[360:39.51]Because I won.
[360:50.07]I used to hang that up in my bedroom when I was a kid.
[360:52.77]All my friends would come over.
[360:53.73]Oh, and they would praise me.
[360:56.74]It just... I just breathed it in.
[360:59.08]I felt so good about it every day.
[361:09.65]Albertson's a winner.
[361:18.82]Dude, on IMDB it says you did voice work for Minecraft Story Mode.
[361:23.18]You know how easy it is to make shit up about somebody?
[361:27.54]You know how many fake fucking made-up shit things are about me online?
[361:30.90]No, I'm not in Minecraft Story Mode.
[361:34.31]I also wasn't on like a fucking 1994 TV show as like a news anchor.
[361:44.27]I can make an IMDB page right now as like...
[361:47.79]Dick Grayson and pretend Robin's real.
[361:59.66]Streamer admits he's not real.
[362:01.20]This guy just one HP, huh?
[362:18.65]Somebody had an IMDb page removed because people kept making shit up.
[362:26.19]Why would somebody go on the internet and lie?
[362:28.09]I know.
[362:28.70]Why would they do something like that?
[362:35.02]It's going on my IMDb page right now.
[362:37.54]And what's the picture of me?
[362:43.01]I got trolled in fake life and real life.
[362:45.77]What the fuck?
[362:57.88]Oh my god.
[363:07.37]Minecraft story mode.
[363:09.21]Mr. Sneak Man.
[363:11.53]Oh yeah, that's me.
[363:12.59]It's so funny because some of these are real.
[363:29.54]That's fucking so dumb.
[363:31.82]What are these pictures that you people have put on here?
[363:39.80]Oh my fucking god.
[363:43.03]Oh wow, that's great.
[363:45.15]Hey Ma, look what I did Ma!
[363:47.15]See what I'm saying?
[363:55.24]Dude, one time, I... I don't want to say it.
[363:58.12]I'm not even going to say it because I don't want to give attention to it because I don't know... I'm not going to do it.
[364:03.28]But somebody... Somebody made a fake social media account of me and called it an official one.
[364:09.30]And wrote a bunch of fucking wicked fucked up shit.
[364:12.48]And I had to go on an apology tour and tell people that it's not real.
[364:17.59]I don't have an account.
[364:18.43]I don't have like any social media accounts and people can just like fucking pretend to be you and say and do crazy fucking things.
[364:25.24]And people got like upset at me.
[364:27.14]They're like, I can't believe you would say it.
[364:28.84]That's kind of fucked up.
[364:29.62]Why would you do something like that?
[364:30.72]I'm like, dude, I don't even know.
[364:32.00]I like, I don't do anything.
[364:33.74]I don't like do shit.
[364:41.58]I barely tweet on my fucking iPhone.
[364:54.23]Fake Twitter.
[364:54.83]No, my Twitter's real.
[365:00.88]I don't do anything!
[365:02.00]God.
[365:06.04]You know, the whole real name thing, like, people have known for a long time.
[365:18.55]The only thing I hope is truly is that...
[365:22.12]I don't know, man.
[365:22.74]You just have to... Holy shit, I'm famous.
[365:25.37]You just gotta be careful, you know, because, you know, it's a scary world out there.
[365:37.82]Real talk-wise, you know.
[365:52.56]He's learned a lesson!
[366:06.18]That's pretty great, actually.
[366:07.24]That was good.
[366:12.58]Praise him!
[366:15.38]Apparently I was Glue Man in Nacho Libre.
[366:28.58]Got a lot of money now, though.
[366:36.90]Nah, that doesn't bother me.
[366:40.55]It bothers a lot of people, though.
[366:43.43]And I can understand that maybe you wouldn't want people to know who you are if you're just kind of on the internet.
[366:51.29]But it's like anything else.
[366:54.73]I mean, what, like, there are plenty of people that exist that are in much more larger of a limelight or spotlight than anybody on Twitch would be.
[367:06.02]And everybody knows their fucking name.
[367:07.34]Alright, we're even.
[367:13.49]60 loyalty.
[367:13.81]Good.
[367:25.57]What do I want to do here?
[367:29.67]What do I want to do here?
[367:31.03]I found your tip.
[367:38.20]No, I don't take any pictures with my phone.
[367:41.22]Sorry.
[367:44.42]I take pictures with my eyes and my mind.
[367:46.38]I go like this.
[367:46.96]If I want to take a picture, I go like this.
[367:48.38]Somebody's like standing there looking at me, I go... And I remember it forever.
[367:58.90]Alright, maybe defense.
[368:05.29]Defense or skill.
[368:12.19]Um, let's see.
[368:13.43]Let's rest him.
[368:14.03]Let's see what we can do.
[368:18.42]Still can't believe you routinely show us your face.
[368:20.30]You're a brave man.
[368:22.04]Alright.
[368:35.62]I don't care.
[368:38.73]We're all friends here.
[368:42.99]Was I actually the BM in Hearthstone?
[368:48.97]What the fuck are you guys doing?
[368:52.10]I just opened up, like, Outlook accidentally.
[368:53.88]I'm, like, concerned now.
[368:55.86]What's going on here?
[369:05.17]Don't freak me out like this!
[369:06.66]Oh my fucking god.
[369:20.88]Alright, nah, we're good.
[369:32.84]Why do you even have outlook?
[369:35.18]I don't.
[369:35.52]I just clicked on the dumb Windows 10 mail button.
[369:38.88]Alright, let's do an Errantry.
[369:42.55]Skill Errantry.
[369:47.85]Bingo.
[369:50.77]Seems that your monster will acquire no techniques there.
[369:53.43]Uh-oh.
[369:55.39]I do not want to do it.
[369:56.18]Power then, because I still need the power technique, right?
[369:59.64]Seems that there is some chance...
[370:03.31]Let's go to D, uh... Hellwall... Glutton.
[370:08.90]We gotta get revenge on this dude.
[370:20.58]Success!
[370:21.18]New tech!
[370:25.52]You came back from running errands and say I have 60 loyalty now.
[370:27.56]I'm very proud of you.
[370:28.18]Thank you.
[370:31.64]You can unpin it.
[370:32.86]What do you mean, unpin it?
[370:36.28]Can I get another- a damn heavy technique already?
[370:39.60]It says here the engineering crypt arc.
[370:43.43]Haha, it's crazy.
[370:44.25]Why would people lie about that?
[370:57.84]Give me a new attack!
[370:59.38]Yeah!
[371:12.56]Right click on the mail.
[371:13.42]Yeah, but right clicking is like, I don't want to read.
[371:17.42]I barely read Garfield once a day.
[371:23.34]Red shell.
[371:24.34]Well, we're not fighting you.
[371:26.12]It's been nice knowing you here.
[371:35.83]I'm not going to fight Crystal Man.
[371:50.44]That thing looks awesome though.
[371:59.25]Mario Kart?
[372:00.33]Mr. Krabs?
[372:01.81]That does look like Mr. Krabs, but...
[372:04.20]No, who's the crab guy that lifts weights in Spongebob?
[372:17.44]Larry the Lobster, that's his name.
[372:35.32]He's got a new technique.
[372:37.54]Seems pretty strong.
[372:38.64]Praise him!
[372:40.32]Now we're gonna be strict.
[372:45.31]Seems pretty tired.
[372:46.03]Give him some rest.
[372:47.49]59 loyalty.
[372:50.01]I can't... Can anybody here do Donald Duck?
[372:52.43]I find that to be the hardest thing to do in the world.
[372:56.30]You push all the air against your mouth, like top right of your cheek, right?
[372:59.38]And go... Then you have to form words.
[373:02.02]How do you do that?
[373:06.31]I just said hello.
[373:06.91]Does that work?
[373:07.67]Let me try it again.
[373:12.79]Sign me up.
[373:13.30]Get me on that show.
[373:17.08]Let's give him some rest.
[373:25.22]It's hard.
[373:25.64]It's not hard.
[373:26.32]What do you mean it's not hard?
[373:28.74]If it wasn't hard, there wouldn't be a guy that gets paid like eight million dollars a year to do it.
[373:36.40]It's going to drive me crazy.
[373:37.60]Rest again.
[373:39.36]No.
[373:40.52]He's fine.
[373:43.16]Let's see the new move.
[373:44.06]324 power.
[373:49.87]Oh, lord, lord, lord.
[373:51.53]There it is.
[373:52.43]We got it.
[373:54.85]We got the drill attack now.
[374:01.19]That's so... I'm so happy now.
[374:05.10]Try again.
[374:05.44]That last one sounded pretty good.
[374:06.50]Okay.
[374:12.16]Time to drill somebody.
[374:13.64]So that's beef.
[374:23.91]That's a really high damaging move.
[374:25.43]Doesn't hit that often.
[374:26.25]We need more skill.
[374:27.05]Let's just drill skill.
[374:35.37]Let's just do a typical drill skill.
[374:37.99]It's not really helping.
[374:49.52]Don't ever do that sound again and get a haircut.
[374:53.80]Yeah, I could.
[374:56.02]Control your enthusiasm.
[375:03.78]I think we are capable now.
[375:07.86]Let's go with some meat.
[375:11.14]Spoil him a little bit, and then we're going to bring it down to be strict.
[375:20.73]Official tournament at the end of the month.
[375:26.46]He's ready.
[375:28.40]No, he's not.
[375:29.00]We're going to do another one of these iron trees.
[375:31.02]If it is.
[375:33.10]What do you think?
[375:33.52]Skill or power?
[375:34.50]Yeah, oh boy.
[375:35.92]Power.
[375:36.34]Skill.
[375:37.78]Definitely skill.
[375:39.15]61 loyalty.
[375:39.79]Get out of here.
[375:49.56]We need skill.
[375:50.28]The more we can hit that drill move, the better.
[375:52.92]I'm gonna do skill forever.
[375:57.44]Not gonna require a new technique.
[376:01.41]But, I mean, it's still... I'll save it first, but I just want the pure skill level up.
[376:07.00]Yeah, I haven't saved in a while.
[376:14.14]Yeah, hold on.
[376:16.52]Let's do that.
[376:18.58]Save in case my power dies.
[376:20.14]I love how that's actually a point of contention here.
[376:24.90]Like, it could happen.
[376:31.90]Don't let it get stressed out.
[376:32.84]Mint leaf.
[376:36.34]Am I really looking over here right now?
[376:38.78]And honest to God, am I actually looking over in this chat and seeing 50% of the chat is talking about how bald I am and how short I am?
[376:46.89]Is that old material?
[376:51.39]Guys.
[376:51.67]Guys.
[376:53.76]Guys.
[376:58.03]Oh, I'm really seeing that right now.
[376:59.39]Look at this.
[377:00.17]I look like a fucking Final Fantasy 15 character.
[377:05.05]Start playing the fucking battle music.
[377:08.13]That'd help prey on somebody.
[377:11.19]Like this.
[377:13.39]Not like this.
[377:15.01]Like this.
[377:15.45]Let's go.
[377:31.52]We got C, this is C, D, uh, air entry.
[377:37.71]Skill.
[377:47.65]Skill.
[377:50.80]Don't matter.
[377:51.32]Should I go for a C monster now?
[377:55.36]How about this, like, weird, yeah, we'll go C.
[378:09.68]No, no face cam.
[378:10.64]I don't do face cam here.
[378:12.58]I do face cam randomly for no reason.
[378:19.41]Germa, would you want to know if someone was about to perform voodoo on you, whether or not you believe it works?
[378:26.33]What are you doing to me?
[378:28.32]No, no, don't voodoo.
[378:29.56]Don't voodoo me.
[378:31.16]What the hell?
[378:31.74]What did I do?
[378:32.92]Don't do any voodoo.
[378:34.02]Don't do a voodoo curse or something on me.
[378:39.27]Don't do that.
[378:41.05]I'm going to start wearing garlic around my neck.
[378:55.71]How to counteract a voodoo spell.
[379:00.13]I'm fucking serious.
[379:01.07]I'm not okay with this.
[379:03.17]How to remove a black magic spell with nine steps.
[379:06.77]How?
[379:08.71]In a hurry, in a hurry.
[379:11.23]One of the easiest ways to rid yourself of black magic spell is to take a bath with salt and herbs like high soft basil and mugwort.
[379:17.93]If you're still feeling cursed, try building more of those herbs together with string and burning them outdoors.
[379:24.03]If all else fails, use your laughter and positive energy to counteract the negativity and break the spell.
[379:28.63]For other ways to remove black magic spells like visiting a psychic or spiritual healer.
[379:33.25]All right, I think I'm gonna be all right.
[379:35.00]Positivity and then fucking laughter.
[379:37.00]You're never gonna curse me.
[379:40.40]How to know if you're cursed.
[379:42.86]Examine your reasons for thinking you might have been cursed.
[379:45.11]Is there someone out there who wishes you ill?
[379:46.93]Why?
[379:47.25]Why?
[379:48.03]What did I do?
[379:51.91]Why?
[379:52.23]That is the question.
[379:55.46]Why, man?
[379:56.68]Don't do that to me.
[380:01.38]Is there someone out there who wishes you ill?
[380:02.84]Why?
[380:03.12]It's unusual to be cursed by someone you don't know.
[380:09.95]So chances are, if you're cursed, it's because someone you know has a problem with you.
[380:15.82]Here are the most common types of curses and hexes someone might have to cast upon you.
[380:19.42]A love hex, making you fall in love when you don't naturally want to.
[380:24.12]Nope, don't.
[380:25.54]Revenge spell, a bad luck hex, anger boils curse, and a series of bad dreams.
[380:34.16]My luck's been, see if your luck has been especially bad.
[380:38.03]If you've had a run of terrible luck, it might mean that someone has cast a luck spell on you.
[380:48.90]I've had a fucking hellish, hellish week, by the way.
[380:53.98]Like two weeks.
[380:56.61]The plow I've had no power for fucking two weeks like off and on the plow crashed into my fucking car I've been feeling like actually really sick.
[381:04.90]Take it off Take it off You fall ill for no apparent reason it's not the common cold you get bad scores on a test You've had bad acne
[381:31.61]No, we're good.
[381:41.03]You trip and fall in a basketball game?
[381:43.11]Your car you're driving in brakes so somebody crashes?
[381:48.59]I'm fucking... I'm doing a salt bath tonight, I swear to God.
[381:53.32]Take it off.
[381:56.22]How do I get, like, the fucking negative energy off of me?
[382:01.73]I don't know.
[382:03.39]Take it off.
[382:04.19]Please.
[382:04.49]I'm sorry for whatever I did.
[382:09.48]When are the... When are the men in white... Get fucking drilled!
[382:20.69]When are the men in white coats coming to take Jeremy?
[382:30.39]Oh, my fucking god.
[382:36.75]You believe voodoo, but not personality tests.
[382:39.03]Dude, I'm sorry, but fucking for real, I plow crashed into my car.
[382:48.19]I haven't been in a car-related accident or problem in fucking, like, eight, 16, or 17 years.
[383:00.08]Why did that happen?
[383:05.40]Why did I send my monster into Errantry without learning techs?
[383:08.41]Because I want as much skill as possible.
[383:12.69]As fast as... as quickly.
[383:16.95]My car was in a parking spot!
[383:18.47]It wasn't on the street, it was in a parking spot!
[383:28.43]He's dead.
[383:28.87]And I got that money back.
[383:29.71]It's an easy money.
[383:31.71]He did it again.
[383:40.46]Good job.
[383:41.10]Here's the money.
[383:45.06]There it is.
[383:55.29]I am not going to praise him.
[384:02.59]Maybe the- Maybe the plow guy was cursed and it's not actually you.
[384:11.56]Yeah, but then I'm also cursed because it affects my life.
[384:18.20]Jeremy, honey, voodoo is not real.
[384:24.79]I'm gonna save the game, don't worry.
[384:26.55]Stop putting curses on me.
[384:27.73]There's 25 fucking hundred people here putting voodoo curses on me.
[384:40.06]It's been 10 years since Jeremy and I began working together.
[384:43.19]It's been great.
[384:44.27]Let's hope for another 10.
[384:47.67]Yes, who is it?
[384:48.87]Free our entry.
[384:49.29]Now it's going to be the item shop.
[384:54.54]Buy some more stuff.
[384:55.14]I have to dab to remove the curses.
[385:09.99]I can use mine.
[385:11.00]Did I plant the tree seed yet?
[385:16.96]I don't even know what that means.
[385:25.71]I'm going to go grab Panda Express.
[385:27.09]Don't burn the house down.
[385:29.73]I'll try.
[385:30.19]What do I have here?
[385:34.15]I want to give him a stress reduction.
[385:55.37]What the fuck am I doing?
[386:01.36]Alright, let's buy some shit at the shop.
[386:04.68]What's up, lady?
[386:06.88]Get the fuck out of here.
[386:11.22]Always buy mint leaves from the... Why is this not on sale?
[386:14.22]What happened here?
[386:14.96]What's going on here?
[386:15.84]I don't understand.
[386:16.40]Why is this not on sale?
[386:22.47]They just told me there was a sale, and I just ran it with all my money, and they took it without it being a sale here.
[386:36.78]What?
[386:37.20]Didn't I just get the thing in the mail?
[386:38.76]Get that fucking curse off me, dude, seriously.
[386:46.39]How well do I handle horror?
[386:47.70]Like, creepy actually is... I'm alright with horror movies.
[386:50.90]Horror stuff.
[386:52.32]I rested.
[386:52.90]Fucking cursed.
[387:00.26]And what we got for... I'm gonna look at myself here.
[387:05.34]Defense is important.
[387:07.12]I'm gonna do more defense training here.
[387:12.88]Let's do some drills.
[387:15.22]When's the next tournament, though?
[387:17.46]Battle.
[387:17.84]Alright, we got... We got a... Let's see... Here's the Spring Carnival.
[387:27.85]When's the next official tournament, though?
[387:29.61]I could do this one.
[387:30.47]Let's just do this one now.
[387:31.63]Give me two grand right now.
[387:36.98]Do you get cursed by association?
[387:38.30]Maybe you do.
[387:38.66]I don't know.
[387:39.26]I didn't look up the whole voodoo chart.
[387:41.70]Could be.
[387:44.50]Like, scary thoughts.
[387:47.79]Yeah, I mean, I don't like to sleep in a totally pitch black room.
[387:53.33]Not because, I mean, it is a little weird.
[387:56.43]But I... Talk about the practical reasons why you don't want to be in a pitch black room.
[388:01.02]Because if I get up to go to the bathroom, if I want, like, a glass of water or something... You just, you have your hands holding out, you just stumble into something if you have something on the ground.
[388:10.57]Um...
[388:13.01]And plus, there might be a scary monster in the room somewhere.
[388:15.89]And what if there was?
[388:17.33]What if there was a guy just standing in the closet?
[388:21.25]Dude, there's a 99% chance.
[388:23.07]99.9% chance it's not going to happen.
[388:26.19]What if there was?
[388:27.07]What if there's just a guy standing in the room?
[388:30.15]What are you going to do?
[388:31.87]I want to be able to see that guy.
[388:38.68]That's why I like to sleep with a small...
[388:43.09]Barely on red light turned on.
[388:46.81]Red light does not screw around with your night vision.
[388:49.03]So if you have a night light that's red, a deep red too, you can stare at it all you want.
[388:58.19]It's not going to screw with your night vision at all.
[389:04.47]We meet again.
[389:06.01]Drill Insta.
[389:10.94]Now that's why we're gonna win every tournament now.
[389:13.02]Just do it again.
[389:15.30]It takes a lot of guts, but that... that's a good way to start.
[389:23.51]They need a Nightlight.
[389:24.53]It's not a Nightlight- What am I doing?
[389:36.68]What have I done?
[389:38.51]What the fuck am I done?
[389:40.11]Why?
[389:40.35]I... I just... Why is he hurting me so much?
[389:43.51]I need more defense.
[389:44.19]Holy shit, he just destroyed me.
[389:47.29]What happened there?
[389:50.68]Why did he do 126 damage to me?
[389:55.76]And then 100.
[389:56.20]Are you serious?
[390:04.67]I have more power than that guy, and he'd crit me for 130.
[390:16.45]I need more speed, man.
[390:23.06]There we go.
[390:23.56]That's what I'm talking about.
[390:24.36]Game over.
[390:28.58]Need more of those.
[390:33.44]Return the dab or suffer the curse.
[390:40.70]Go back to fighting the banana guy.
[390:45.36]Yeah, well, we lost.
[390:50.37]Somehow.
[391:02.22]Gord, loser.
[391:05.34]At least I made $600.
[391:07.54]Don't lose any fans.
[391:10.87]It's actually game fans.
[391:12.24]See, they understood how much bullshit that was.
[391:16.46]Double crit, 100 damage, more than 100 damage for each one.
[391:19.10]Is this the Dark Souls of Monster Rancher games?
[391:28.67]Yeah.
[391:37.13]We're going to not encourage it.
[391:41.13]No spoiling here.
[391:41.85]56.
[391:45.83]Alright, now we're gonna go... We're gonna give him some candy.
[391:52.71]Let's, um... I have candy, right?
[391:56.94]Where is it?
[391:57.30]Candy!
[391:58.26]Monsters will gain weight if they eat a lot of the sweet foods like this.
[392:01.28]Eat some... Have some candy.
[392:02.98]Okay.
[392:10.53]See?
[392:11.13]Delicious candy.
[392:12.35]Take a rest, buddy.
[392:14.93]You deserve it.
[392:23.03]I assume we've already made fun of all the nut oil.
[392:27.62]Yes, we have.
[392:28.46]Many, many times.
[392:39.60]He's got the fat curse.
[392:44.06]Alright, what have we got?
[392:45.82]Let's see.
[392:47.02]Round Robin.
[392:47.78]$3,000.
[392:47.82]Can we please get this to work?
[392:51.04]Sleep again.
[392:51.61]And just win this tournament.
[392:53.07]I need the money.
[392:53.67]And I want... We're gonna win.
[393:05.87]There we go.
[393:06.94]Battle...
[393:09.14]Get that three grand.
[393:14.69]You deflect those curses with nut oil.
[393:21.86]Please find the Tim Allen noise monster.
[393:24.00]That's one of the things I don't understand about this.
[393:28.18]Where is that guy?
[393:29.12]Is that some rare monster?
[393:30.43]What is the Tim Allen monster?
[393:40.53]Okay, these people are new.
[393:42.31]Nicole Rockgeiser?
[393:45.29]What the hell is Rockgeiser?
[393:48.63]Alright, speed.
[394:03.53]No defense.
[394:06.32]Not really that powerful, but a lot of speed.
[394:08.20]It's going to be hard to hit her.
[394:10.77]So, I mean, we just drilled right off the bat at 30%.
[394:12.73]We give a shit.
[394:15.11]Now we play smart because he fooled around.
[394:16.65]Just gotta get a good looking hit here.
[394:23.08]All it takes is one.
[394:24.80]Right?
[394:25.00]All it takes is one.
[394:31.70]We gotta get a hit.
[394:32.28]There it is.
[394:35.47]Come on now.
[394:36.33]What are you thinking here?
[394:40.60]Now I do have to be concerned.
[394:42.02]Because I need to hit her.
[394:44.49]And I'm not going to be able to do that, apparently.
[394:47.03]Just not going to be able to do it.
[394:49.87]I'll just miss every time.
[394:51.21]I'll miss every fucking time.
[394:53.21]That sounds like fun to me.
[394:54.75]What about you guys?
[394:55.49]Does that sound like fun to you?
[394:57.69]We've got to go for a Hail Mary drill.
[395:00.13]That's the way it is.
[395:01.13]At 26%.
[395:01.53]I thought I got it.
[395:05.07]Again.
[395:06.77]Hail Mary.
[395:07.19]23.
[395:07.79]Come on.
[395:10.17]Do it.
[395:11.09]You st- Come on!
[395:13.11]Why?
[395:13.79]God, I have 60 fucking loyalty!
[395:16.07]It's like, come on!
[395:19.85]Why am I missing everything and why is he still fucking up with confusion?
[395:24.16]I've got 60 fucking loyalty.
[395:26.86]What the hell?
[395:29.54]That's not mildly irritating or anything.
[395:52.35]Control is slam.
[395:57.00]Apparently irritating.
[395:58.32]Look, this guy sucks!
[396:01.04]I just have to land a move.
[396:02.26]We're doing all skill from here on out.
[396:03.86]Because I'm not going to land any fucking moves.
[396:11.95]My hit's so hard.
[396:17.65]I gotta go for the sure thing.
[396:18.71]This is the highest percentage I have, except to keep using it.
[396:23.48]Make him do his face attack, because it's not that powerful.
[396:25.60]It's actually pretty terrible.
[396:31.01]Why did I do that?
[396:31.61]I don't even know why I did it!
[396:33.13]I just had to!
[396:33.73]It's available, so I have to press the button.
[396:39.95]We're not going to lose another match.
[396:43.77]Unity.
[396:44.23]I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean, but... Do I have to kill him three times?
[396:50.60]That would make sense, right?
[396:55.35]I'm gonna win anyways.
[397:04.21]Fuck.
[397:10.58]He does three times the damage, but he has half the hit rate.
[397:13.02]Interesting.
[397:18.81]How many entrance were there for?
[397:21.14]Alright, we need... Can Cole and Rock Geiger have to lose?
[397:26.07]Hopefully... I don't know who's going to win this.
[397:33.44]Alright.
[397:34.92]So now we have to beat the Rockman right now.
[397:38.06]And then we have to beat the Rockman again.
[397:42.65]So we've got to win two in a row.
[397:53.80]Alright.
[397:55.42]Terrible speed, terrible skill.
[397:58.22]Not a whole lot of life, but a lot of defense.
[398:00.50]This is one of those roll the dice, and if he fucking rolls a one, you die.
[398:05.02]Alright, well.
[398:10.14]Stay far away.
[398:10.86]I might actually be able to do this if I just drill cheese him.
[398:21.74]Yeah, I win.
[398:23.66]See you later.
[398:25.10]I'll beat this guy twice in a row, because he's not going to be able to come near me.
[398:28.31]Tournament won.
[398:38.97]And this don't matter.
[398:43.43]Here comes the tournament tiebreaker.
[398:47.67]Same scenario.
[398:48.59]Although it is a 48%.
[398:49.81]We got lucky last time.
[398:51.39]This is a game... If we don't play this smart, we're gonna lose.
[398:58.74]Although I do kind of want to... I want to have a handsome rock.
[399:01.00]I feel like it'd be fun to have one of those.
[399:05.89]That's what you're gonna be.
[399:07.15]That's what I was afraid of.
[399:08.83]Bounce it back.
[399:09.43]Come on.
[399:09.75]Bounce it back.
[399:10.51]Don't get hit by this.
[399:11.37]Dodge it.
[399:13.05]Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce.
[399:14.03]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[399:15.19]Push.
[399:15.49]Just push him away.
[399:16.35]Get out!
[399:19.67]Good.
[399:21.51]Do it again.
[399:22.01]Quickly.
[399:22.86]Double tap.
[399:23.62]KO.
[399:26.48]Nice.
[399:36.84]Goddamn.
[399:39.18]That's a, that's a 35, $3,300 championship ring.
[399:51.77]Why do I always think it's going to be the Donkey Kong song?
[399:59.69]Gamer alert.
[400:03.93]Yeah, I know.
[400:05.21]I'm doing a good job today.
[400:10.45]No, we're in the fucking low rank.
[400:14.15]Alright, I'm almost at 100% popular.
[400:18.68]We're at a B for popularity now.
[400:25.04]This is where we level the fuck up, more power, and a shitload of skill.
[400:34.09]This is the guy that's going to take us all the way into A rank, it is.
[400:38.31]He learned some stuff.
[400:39.69]Nice.
[400:40.33]That's exactly what I wanted.
[400:41.73]That's every stat I wanted.
[400:43.03]Maybe no intellect.
[400:46.03]Congratulations on your victory.
[400:48.82]Praise him.
[400:49.18]67.
[400:49.20]$8,000.
[400:49.24]When's the next official tournament?
[400:54.86]Oh.
[401:04.32]Right here.
[401:06.04]And we're gonna do this one.
[401:07.76]So we will participate in that one.
[401:09.26]So let's go rest, train up his skill.
[401:14.62]We'll do skill, skill, skill, skill, defense, defense.
[401:19.55]Because that will take us to... So we do skill, skill, defense, rest.
[401:29.99]You got it.
[401:34.64]No, I'm just seeing if there's anything here that I want.
[401:41.88]Skill.
[401:48.14]Success.
[401:50.58]Not getting much for this, but... The snow's getting old really fast.
[401:58.05]Yeah, it is.
[401:59.86]Just a little while back, just a little while back I hit some asshole's car with my snowplow while clearing a parka- What the fuck?
[402:19.90]I'm giving him a tablet.
[402:20.98]Take your fucking medicine!
[402:36.69]Do the defense Errantry?
[402:37.75]I don't think I have it yet.
[402:40.03]Wait a minute!
[402:40.41]Hold on!
[402:41.11]Wait a minute!
[402:42.69]Oh, this is my calling card!
[402:45.31]Torble University Archaeologist.
[402:46.83]We're gonna go on an expedition and we're gonna find a new monster.
[402:50.88]Once upon a time, when the world was one big continent, gods sealed the monsters into disk stones and hid all their disk stones in a shrine.
[402:58.38]And I have ascended that the legendary shrine is located on this continent.
[403:03.66]Ha ha.
[403:04.74]No ha ha.
[403:05.62]See, this guy gets it.
[403:07.28]It is a great discovery.
[403:08.78]I must go there.
[403:10.29]Well, what does it have to do with us?
[403:11.91]It looks like that there are various obstacles on the way to the shrine.
[403:16.37]I want you guys to go on this adventure with me.
[403:20.29]I'll pay you and give you some of the items we find during the adventure.
[403:25.92]Ha.
[403:27.30]This is just Twitch chat.
[403:30.24]Ha ha.
[403:31.82]Gonna give me more ha-has?
[403:33.24]In order to get rid of those obstacles and proceed with this adventure, we have to use a monster.
[403:37.92]A strong monster, that is.
[403:39.18]I came here because Pabst told me.
[403:42.44]Oh, you know Pabst.
[403:43.44]You should have said that.
[403:45.04]Now I understand, Jeremy.
[403:46.04]Your monster might get injured.
[403:47.17]Do you... Go!
[403:49.05]Do you make it?
[403:49.69]Go with it.
[403:50.13]Go!
[403:51.47]You don't know what's gonna happen?
[403:52.29]Something might happen?
[403:52.95]Go!
[403:54.01]Are you sure you want to make this?
[403:54.85]Go!
[403:57.91]Dr. Talica, we can let it go.
[403:59.13]Here we go!
[404:05.44]Can't handle you monster by myself.
[404:06.86]No.
[404:07.28]Can't.
[404:12.10]Well done, let's go.
[404:14.95]Are we all ready?
[404:15.51]Yes.
[404:17.01]You better take off.
[404:20.39]Okay, I... I might be a little bit tired, but I thought he just said you better, like, take off and, like, change your clothes.
[404:25.13]Take off your clothes or something.
[404:26.29]I'm just like, what the fuck is in my reading?
[404:28.91]You better go take off and change, like... Like, what are you saying, dude?
[404:32.16]Like, fuck off.
[404:41.18]This creepy old fuck.
[404:44.72]Prologue to the adventure.
[404:47.00]We finally arrived at the Phoenix Volcano.
[404:48.94]Northern Phoenix.
[404:50.64]First, let's set up base camp.
[404:53.88]Done.
[404:55.24]Let's get started.
[404:55.96]Ahem.
[404:56.34]But before we start, let me explain a little bit about the adventure.
[405:00.12]At the beginning of the adventure, energy points will be given depending on your monster's life force condition.
[405:08.19]Yes, energy.
[405:08.73]This energy will be the life gauge for this adventure.
[405:13.33]The energy will be reduced with every step your monster makes.
[405:17.96]When it gets all the energy from the Wadao Womb, when we find that meter, we'll find Dr. Waluigi.
[405:25.70]We may be able to find another energy source.
[405:30.07]I'm sorry, I'm not even paying attention.
[405:32.39]It removes a rock that might be sitting in its way.
[405:35.82]I fucking missed that whole thing because I did that.
[405:39.34]So always pay attention to your monster's energy.
[405:42.30]That wasn't a meme voice.
[405:43.23]That was Dr. fucking Carlton.
[405:44.77]Whatever his name is.
[405:45.51]Dr. Car- What's his name?
[405:46.87]No, not Dr. Carson.
[405:48.51]That's a fucking politician.
[405:51.61]You must go back to base camp while you're- What's his name?
[405:56.21]Dr. Car- Dr. Carmichael.
[406:00.17]Dr. Cart- Cardin.
[406:02.09]What's his name?
[406:09.25]Why don't... Carbon!
[406:10.73]Dr. Carbon!
[406:11.31]I don't fucking know what his name is.
[406:22.74]The guy from Mega Man!
[406:23.62]Alright, the monster's lifespan is gonna be taken away.
[406:28.20]So I gotta go X, Y. What the fuck is going on here?
[406:34.48]Okay, so I can go left or right.
[406:35.64]I'm gonna go left.
[406:38.48]I'm gonna go minus X. Two more three energy.
[406:44.85]Am I missing something here?
[406:52.92]What is... Did I just go the long way?
[406:55.86]Did this just wrap me around the whole place?
[406:59.50]The road is blocked and we can't go any further.
[407:00.96]Do you want to move it?
[407:02.36]Yes.
[407:03.81]Crack it.
[407:05.37]You're great, Mr. Ice Cream.
[407:06.37]Good job.
[407:07.81]No, I want to go this way.
[407:10.61]Okay, here we go.
[407:11.13]What's this?
[407:11.79]The Tree of Life.
[407:13.15]We can't go any further.
[407:13.91]Do you want... Break it.
[407:15.02]Let's go inside the building.
[407:20.06]Go in here.
[407:22.58]Oh, there's an entrance here.
[407:24.58]Um, I smell something in the cave.
[407:27.49]What do you smell?
[407:28.63]I don't mean that kind of smell.
[407:29.85]I feel something related to disk stones.
[407:31.81]Or how can I say it?
[407:33.21]I feel a book of monsters.
[407:34.59]A legendary monster might be buried here.
[407:39.27]Really?
[407:39.51]They usually say a woman's intuition.
[407:41.77]But I guess we should call it doctor's intuition this time.
[407:45.41]Well, shall we investigate it?
[407:46.47]Yes.
[407:52.89]Yeah.
[407:54.07]Now what's that?
[407:58.60]I broke it.
[408:02.32]I want that thing.
[408:02.94]I want it.
[408:03.68]I want that monster.
[408:04.92]I'm gonna have it.
[408:05.54]It's mine.
[408:06.10]I'll take it.
[408:06.98]I'll take one, please.
[408:07.86]One of those monsters, please.
[408:08.74]One monster, please.
[408:11.86]We get a... A griffin?
[408:14.54]24-hour stream confirmed.
[408:21.97]Oh, isn't that the legendary monster Phoenix?
[408:23.77]The guardian god of the mountain.
[408:27.93]It's not a legendary monster.
[408:29.09]It's a real and it's alive.
[408:31.17]And that was a lie, by the way.
[408:32.25]I'm not doing a 24-hour stream.
[408:33.61]I will never do one.
[408:34.35]It'll never happen.
[408:34.95]That's a lie.
[408:35.99]I better let him know about it as soon as possible.
[408:38.60]Who are you going to tell about it?
[408:39.94]Huh?
[408:40.22]Oh, never mind.
[408:41.30]Anyway, seems like this is not the place I'm looking for.
[408:44.10]I wonder where that Shrine of Gods is.
[408:46.84]I wonder if Mr. Ice Cream is alright.
[408:49.46]Shall we investigate inside again?
[408:50.73]Um...
[408:56.40]I don't understand.
[408:56.94]I can go in again.
[408:58.48]Should I do this again?
[409:00.72]Go back in the cave again?
[409:01.58]It's a seagull protecting his mountain of trash.
[409:07.28]Okay.
[409:10.80]Oh.
[409:12.54]So that was... Wait, let me... I gotta study this.
[409:16.21]What am I studying?
[409:19.55]Do I... Is this me controlling him?
[409:22.43]Mr. Ice Cream's back.
[409:23.61]It didn't bring an item back, though.
[409:26.09]Go get back in there!
[409:30.19]Don't do the same route you just did.
[409:31.67]You just did the same route.
[409:33.71]This is why the intelligence being this low is bad.
[409:37.19]Oh my lord.
[409:42.25]Do it again.
[409:44.05]Just don't go the same exact way that you already went.
[409:47.24]No, you've been in every nook and cranny besides the ones that have items.
[409:54.04]Just do it again.
[410:04.32]Do it again.
[410:05.62]Do it again.
[410:07.00]Hop into the left.
[410:09.30]Oh my god, you've already been there.
[410:11.08]Is this gonna kill him?
[410:17.61]What happens if I just keep doing this?
[410:51.63]One more slot machine spin.
[410:53.47]Got it.
[410:54.02]Thank you.
[410:54.86]My god.
[410:56.88]Oh.
[410:59.36]You found a couple of bananas.
[411:01.88]Great work.
[411:03.14]I want something better.
[411:16.15]Last one.
[411:16.55]That's it.
[411:16.93]Last spin on the machine.
[411:18.91]Left.
[411:20.15]Oh, you stupid animal.
[411:25.77]Get out.
[411:27.07]Don't do it again.
[411:28.01]Leave.
[411:29.41]Oh, fuck.
[411:34.13]Where the hell am I going now?
[411:37.57]Go down.
[411:37.99]Why can I not go down?
[411:41.30]I can't go down this?
[411:42.52]Why?
[411:46.50]I can't go down the cliff here.
[411:47.48]Do I have to go all the way around the whole mountain again?
[411:49.66]I can't go down this.
[412:05.08]fucking dead.
[412:06.82]Stop.
[412:07.14]Go back to camp.
[412:08.68]We're dying on the mountain.
[412:10.16]What do you mean we're dying on the mountain?
[412:15.79]Dr. Light!
[412:16.45]That's his name.
[412:17.03]Thank you.
[412:19.53]Do I... Everybody calm down for a second here.
[412:25.57]Go back.
[412:26.03]Like, go... Go up around the mountain again.
[412:29.15]Go into the mountain and try to get him more items.
[412:37.77]You die when your energy runs out.
[412:39.37]Don't you dare say that.
[412:47.61]I have to go all the way back around the whole mountain.
[412:59.52]More items are going.
[413:00.60]That's not gonna work like that.
[413:06.36]19.
[413:08.05]17.
[413:08.97]15.
[413:10.15]13.
[413:10.17]10.
[413:11.19]I'm gonna get there, right?
[413:12.23]Is that the camp?
[413:14.85]I did it.
[413:16.69]Finish the adventure, right?
[413:18.79]Good.
[413:22.24]I'm fine.
[413:22.64]I'm alive.
[413:26.08]You all doubted me.
[413:33.06]Let's check the result of the adventure.
[413:35.13]Yes, let's do that.
[413:36.84]Oh.
[413:37.84]You found some bananas.
[413:42.22]Great.
[413:46.77]Nice work.
[413:48.15]Thanks.
[413:53.41]We did all that for a banana.
[413:56.13]But didn't I unlock a monster?
[413:57.49]The griffon that came out of the mountain?
[414:00.08]I can't open him now?
[414:04.69]We can't get the Phoenix now.
[414:10.70]Oh, I'm dead.
[414:11.30]Who's dead?
[414:12.22]Oh.
[414:18.08]I have to find it.
[414:25.57]So the really... I went in the cave like ten times.
[414:30.71]I tried.
[414:33.51]I got a banana.
[414:34.25]That's all I could get.
[414:38.03]He deserves some meat for that one, by the way.
[414:53.08]And before it's the assistant who dies.
[414:54.90]76 loyalty.
[414:57.46]Even.
[414:58.14]This guy, we're doing great.
[414:59.74]We're doing a great job raising this son of ours.
[415:10.33]He seems tired sleep again give me to a hundred I'll take a hundred man.
[415:16.20]I really will Sleep and I'm gonna give him a mint leaf Now if you missed out needed the feather from the mountain now get back there you need to be higher Now to get back there.
[415:26.92]You need to be higher rank and it'll be ten times harder to get the feather Well, I I mean I tried I tried a dozen times I
[415:38.26]At what point do I just... I couldn't get it.
[415:41.14]That sucks.
[415:42.92]Use.
[415:45.50]No, use, use, use, use.
[415:49.20]Save.
[415:49.42]I'm going to save.
[415:49.96]I am, I am, I am.
[415:54.95]I want to take that... Take it.
[415:57.39]Mint leaf.
[415:58.19]I think I'm going to do... No, I don't need to do star prune.
[416:02.93]No reason to.
[416:11.23]Don't bother, it's just one monster.
[416:12.77]Yeah, but that still sucks.
[416:15.25]Let's... Maybe we'll do another Errantry.
[416:20.21]I'm going to say Power Errantry, maybe?
[416:23.56]Maybe I will do an Intelligence Errantry.
[416:27.28]When's the next official cup?
[416:29.60]This one's coming up here.
[416:30.66]I'll need the official one.
[416:34.40]Oh, wow.
[416:34.96]I fucking missed it, huh?
[416:36.90]Well, we're going to rest and then do this one.
[416:38.82]No, we're not.
[416:39.96]Let's train him.
[416:40.92]Honest to God.
[416:42.14]Errantry.
[416:45.34]I missed out on getting a god.
[416:47.06]Yes, I did.
[416:50.11]Errantry's lower lifespan.
[416:52.33]So should I just do skill on... I mean, is it worth just doing it for the stats?
[417:00.05]Or should I just train the drills and just do skill over and over again?
[417:05.89]You know?
[417:10.81]Elimination is important.
[417:12.55]Yeah.
[417:15.51]Do intelligence.
[417:17.65]Just to get it up there.
[417:24.58]Let's get some skill here.
[417:31.28]Five.
[417:31.72]Good.
[417:31.90]Let's get skill with 300.
[417:46.00]We'll be able to get there soon.
[417:46.88]Uh, we'll go with fish.
[417:59.85]Gets half the INT to normal monster wood.
[418:06.97]Yeah, the BB Sonic is part of a monster that's currently frozen.
[418:16.59]I think skill is definitely the stat I want the most at this point.
[418:21.65]Because drill is such an insanely powerful move.
[418:24.01]I want to be able to kill people with it in two hits every tournament.
[418:26.09]270.
[418:30.38]Sleep.
[418:45.73]We're going to do the official C tournament, and then we'll be B. We'll be where we were last time with Sonic.
[418:51.39]And we're going to beat a B tournament with this dude.
[418:53.67]I'm pretty confident in that.
[419:02.69]I could do an Erratory for Skill or an Erratory for Int and get another move.
[419:06.85]But if I'm not going to level up Intelligence, what's the point of getting an Int move if I'm never going to really use it?
[419:28.03]Let's see.
[419:32.05]Because new Errantries open up after I get to B, right?
[419:35.89]So I'll do the Defense Errantry.
[419:38.85]Yeah, I'm not going to do an Errantry right now.
[419:42.69]When's that next?
[419:43.37]When's the official tournament here?
[419:44.83]Right here.
[419:46.13]There's the official tournament.
[419:47.35]Let's do... Skill... Skill, Skill, Skill, Rest.
[419:57.46]No, not power.
[419:59.80]Do I know how to get the Joker?
[420:06.20]I do not.
[420:13.05]We'll drink water.
[420:13.79]I'll be fine.
[420:21.85]Hydration time.
[420:33.72]Did you know the official tournament's the end of the month?
[420:35.30]You have to prepare.
[420:36.22]Oh, I know.
[420:40.12]Grill.
[420:41.56]Shoot.
[420:45.44]Has this been a zero P break stream?
[420:47.12]Yes, it has.
[420:47.52]I have not gone P one time.
[420:51.74]Not once.
[420:53.30]I'm going to do defense, rest, and then tournament.
[421:04.78]So we got... No, we got... Let's rest again.
[421:08.58]Just so we're ready to go.
[421:14.74]I might have to.
[421:15.42]Should I go pee?
[421:18.52]We'll pee and get a glass of water or something.
[421:23.87]Yeah, let's do the... Okay, after this, we'll do the official cup here.
[421:27.59]We'll get up to B.
[421:30.03]I'm going to go pee.
[421:31.16]I'm going to grab a drink of water.
[421:34.20]Come back down.
[421:35.52]Throw some water in my face maybe.
[421:37.12]Pick my nose off stream so nobody sees.
[421:48.34]Here we go.
[421:51.72]Eight matches.
[421:54.83]Is this the most match?
[421:55.99]Is this the highest amount of matches you can have?
[422:01.27]8's a lot.
[422:03.87]Let's do it.
[422:09.51]I assume that probably A and S might be 12.
[422:12.61]Like 8?
[422:13.41]10?
[422:14.81]Alright, we've got... This guy's got terrible defense.
[422:19.94]He's pretty balanced on everything else, so it's going to be hard to hit him.
[422:25.12]We just need to get a couple of good hits on him.
[422:27.28]What's the drill attack at?
[422:28.06]35? 35?
[422:29.96]Always start with thrill.
[422:30.78]Every time.
[422:31.12]Like, literally every time.
[422:34.36]Even if it's a terrible percentage, then we close it out.
[422:40.35]Get him with a big hit.
[422:41.69]Even if it's a tap.
[422:53.00]With more skill, that move becomes almost unbeatable.
[422:56.95]If I get over 300, like 350, something like that... The drill is now... It'll win every single fight for us.
[423:05.54]And then we'll get to A and S and... So A and R. What is this game about?
[423:16.30]This is called Monster Rancher.
[423:19.02]Monster Rancher 2, to be exact.
[423:21.62]So the PlayStation 1, there's one for PlayStation 2, and then there's one for the DS.
[423:26.68]Apparently, the newer one that came out five, ten years ago now, I think the newest one was about how long ago?
[423:33.51]When did the one for the DS come out?
[423:39.00]It's an interesting pattern there, by the way.
[423:40.48]But you put in CDs, you pull DNA from CDs that you have.
[423:44.71]Could be any CD in your whole house.
[423:46.47]Put it in the PlayStation 1, it pulls out monster DNA, and then you raise the monster and fight the monster until the monster dies.
[423:51.85]And you could either let the monster die, or fuse the monster's DNA with another monster, and then start at square one with a slightly improved monster.
[424:03.14]There was a mobile game too.
[424:05.02]That's interesting.
[424:07.97]Alright, here we go.
[424:08.81]We have to beat this guy.
[424:09.83]This is the bane of our existence.
[424:11.73]Gunburn after this is sus bane, right?
[424:15.83]Same deal with this dude.
[424:16.69]Let's try to get it.
[424:17.31]40%.
[424:17.67]Roll the dice.
[424:19.46]Bring it to Casino.
[424:21.88]It's alright.
[424:22.74]It's okay.
[424:25.00]That's not okay.
[424:28.60]That is, though.
[424:32.86]If you fail that first drill, you gotta pull it together.
[424:38.70]And by pull it together, I mean, like, do it again.
[424:41.47]And instantly take the guy out.
[424:42.95]That's what I'm talking about.
[424:55.60]I don't know if I'm getting tired of that spot.
[424:57.58]Scan your blank into a JPG and then burn it.
[425:02.08]And then... Yikes.
[425:05.89]No, Scan, you're blank.
[425:07.09]Like, I've never said the- I've said the word dick before on stream.
[425:09.45]You're great, dude.
[425:14.27]I swear every 30 words, and I'm scared to say the word dick.
[425:21.58]This is PG-13 slash into R-rated stream.
[425:27.23]You already guys knew that.
[425:31.74]Alright, we've got Susvane... Susvane 1.
[425:36.42]Everyone's 2-0 up here.
[425:40.42]So, we beat this guy plenty of times before.
[425:43.06]He's done.
[425:49.33]Yeah, we're fine.
[425:55.95]Just a bunch of life.
[425:56.71]Terrible defense.
[425:57.71]Just got a hit.
[425:58.77]You know what we got a hit.
[425:59.61]First off, right off the bat.
[426:01.05]Bingo.
[426:04.05]I love that when it hits.
[426:05.75]You know what?
[426:06.23]Just try to end it right now.
[426:10.11]Greedy.
[426:11.49]Worth a try.
[426:15.28]As long as I stay close, his attack's not going to do any damage to me.
[426:17.88]Really at all.
[426:23.10]Fine.
[426:23.50]That's fine.
[426:23.86]Push me back to the drill.
[426:27.68]That was scary, because with a name like shotgun...
[426:32.20]I feel like it would be a little bit more heavy hitting than that.
[426:34.04]Dammit.
[426:34.83]Right here.
[426:35.41]55.
[426:35.45]Got it.
[426:35.83]What are you doing?
[426:59.58]Come on, do it!
[427:01.40]Ah, I was trying to do a drill attack at the end.
[427:04.48]Some monsters you have to kill, you know.
[427:12.65]Reno.
[427:15.47]The one problem is going to be Suspain.
[427:19.33]Every single other person here we can beat without much of a problem.
[427:22.89]Oh, that's, that's amazing.
[427:26.40]The stupid banana guy.
[427:28.06]The banana plant.
[427:30.22]Just beat Nicole, who beat us last time.
[427:32.76]No, she doesn't have.
[427:33.50]She's two and one.
[427:36.17]Take out the threats.
[427:37.09]Alright, come on.
[427:37.87]Take out Sussfane.
[427:40.33]What happened?
[427:43.21]Sussfane lost.
[427:45.59]Our victory is almost assured now.
[427:53.48]Good.
[427:55.44]We just have to win another... We have to win two more games and we clinch it.
[427:59.63]As long... If we beat Huey, we clinch the whole thing if I win two more games.
[428:03.79]Alright, this is the... Haven't lost one time against this guy, so don't make it a first.
[428:23.84]Not going to.
[428:24.90]See you later.
[428:25.95]Let's play it smart now.
[428:30.17]That wasn't smart, but sometimes you have to play it dumb.
[428:34.03]Sorry, get hit by the boomerang.
[428:36.45]I'll take the boomerang hit every now and again.
[428:37.79]Dammit.
[428:42.82]Tasty banana?
[428:44.82]It worked.
[428:45.38]This time.
[428:47.14]Take it right away.
[428:48.60]Yes.
[428:50.14]Perfect.
[428:52.83]Shit actually worked.
[428:53.73]Throw the shitty banana at me.
[429:08.79]Alright, so far so good.
[429:10.61]Don't let him eat the banana.
[429:12.03]I'm not going to get screwed here.
[429:20.72]Game over.
[429:21.72]Alright.
[429:25.37]That's the first time the bin has worked.
[429:29.63]So could you effectively play as that plant monkey and just level the hell out of skill and never die because you just can eat a banana and it would be a high enough percentage where you get it most of the time?
[429:44.87]Interesting strategy.
[429:45.85]It's just the turtle strategy.
[429:47.03]Yeah, you could just hit the guy once and then just for the rest of the time try to get to full health.
[429:58.24]Alright, here's the, uh... Here's the kicker here.
[430:03.45]Wow.
[430:04.71]We won.
[430:06.89]Yeah, if we beat Huey, we win.
[430:07.97]It's game over.
[430:10.51]Moving on to B. How the hell did you lose to that guy?
[430:21.10]Alright, this is the one.
[430:21.92]I have to win this.
[430:22.60]I mean, I don't have to, but I do.
[430:36.88]Just don't want to get hit by any of his nonsense.
[430:38.78]His speed is bad.
[430:39.56]We're going for a drill right off the bat.
[430:42.08]If we hit it, we just play defensive the whole game.
[430:45.16]Gonna do it again.
[430:45.96]I'm actually gonna try it again.
[430:46.84]No, I'm not.
[430:50.93]Play smart.
[430:51.91]I'm gonna back it up.
[430:56.83]Shit.
[430:58.03]He's trying so hard to close the gap.
[431:01.43]Got it!
[431:03.50]Awww, no!
[431:06.23]He's pulling me closer.
[431:08.99]He's trying.
[431:13.64]It's alright.
[431:14.72]Back it up.
[431:15.16]Back it up.
[431:15.78]Don't let him keep doing this to you.
[431:17.04]Back it up.
[431:21.86]End it with the drill.
[431:23.02]I gotta end it with fashion, right?
[431:26.39]Don't end it with fashion.
[431:27.21]Just beat the guy.
[431:30.93]Just beat the guy.
[431:32.91]End it with fashion, he says.
[431:35.03]Fashion?
[431:36.56]ENDED WITH FASHION?!
[431:38.64]WHAT ARE YOU ON ABOUT?!
[431:39.86]AND I JUST LOST!
[431:41.38]BECAUSE I TRIED TO END IT WITH FASHION!
[432:02.70]I'm still gonna win the tournament.
[432:04.70]But like, what the fuck?
[432:08.09]Why every single one of these guys was exceptionally easy and I go against that guy and then everything goes fucking wrong.
[432:16.27]Everything just goes wrong against that guy.
[432:22.65]Why would I try to do the drill?
[432:25.13]It was just so much overconfidence for no reason.
[432:28.73]It doesn't matter because I win the tournament.
[432:30.31]If I just beat the stupid, the dumb... What's his name?
[432:36.46]The cat from Pokemon!
[432:37.66]That sucks.
[432:39.28]That they cancelled the show over because it was so annoying.
[432:41.82]What was his name?
[432:43.67]Garth?
[432:52.01]This is bad.
[432:53.39]But it's okay.
[433:00.39]Alright, hold on to these guts.
[433:07.06]Still ahead.
[433:07.46]Just don't let him do his weird shit.
[433:17.11]Yeah, I'll flawless the guy in first place.
[433:20.01]But I can't for the life of me.
[433:22.75]Beat the one guy.
[433:23.85]Nah, I didn't flawless him.
[433:25.29]But it's alright.
[433:25.99]You don't need to flawless everybody.
[433:31.12]Okay.
[433:33.28]Stay in close.
[433:36.72]Get in there.
[433:38.52]Game over.
[433:40.64]I'm not ending with Fashion again.
[433:48.77]I'm not doing that.
[433:51.55]Okay.
[433:52.29]Suspain needs to lose.
[433:54.61]I'm not losing against Suspain again.
[433:57.21]He just has to lose his next match.
[434:00.11]One of you random shitties just accidentally beat this guy for me so I can never see him again.
[434:05.00]Okay, gun burn.
[434:06.32]Just fall over on this guy.
[434:07.84]Please just beat him.
[434:14.46]Damn it.
[434:14.82]Alright, Nicole.
[434:27.07]Nicole.
[434:29.67]Three and three.
[434:30.67]I have to win this.
[434:37.16]Putting a goddamn scarf on.
[434:39.84]Flying around like an asshole.
[434:40.94]Alright, I'm not going to be able to do the across the map, off the turnbuckle frog splash.
[434:45.70]This is not confident.
[434:47.25]Get in there.
[434:51.31]Get in there.
[434:54.01]Go for the ones that are easy.
[434:55.29]I've just got to tap it away.
[434:59.22]She's got nothing.
[435:00.16]She's going to try to close the gap.
[435:01.26]Just don't let her do it.
[435:02.74]She's going to do the sing song to you.
[435:04.97]Don't let her do her tornado move.
[435:06.31]It's the third one.
[435:06.87]Just stay in the middle.
[435:08.25]No, not in the middle.
[435:09.17]She's trying to bump me out to it.
[435:10.17]Don't let it happen.
[435:11.23]Don't let her do it.
[435:12.99]Yep.
[435:13.69]She didn't do it.
[435:14.09]She did her dumb little punch.
[435:16.50]That's when we win the game.
[435:18.54]Bingo.
[435:19.26]Don't...
[435:35.11]Throw in this Refreshing!
[435:40.95]Fuck you, Garth.
[435:42.77]You Care Bear looking asshole.
[435:54.96]Six and one.
[435:56.44]Suspain is five and one.
[435:57.98]It's gonna come down to if he loses it.
[436:09.06]Alright.
[436:09.90]Stupid.
[436:11.42]Just beat him.
[436:12.08]Win.
[436:12.54]You can do it.
[436:13.00]I have faith that you're gonna accidentally win.
[436:15.50]Oh my god, did he win?
[436:18.91]Damn it, he didn't win.
[436:20.57]Oh no!
[436:22.35]Now I have to fight him.
[436:23.39]I can't do any fashion.
[436:28.86]This is for the tournament.
[436:30.54]I have to beat him.
[436:31.80]This is for all the marbles.
[436:33.78]Don't fuck around.
[436:36.00]No fashion here.
[436:37.10]Allowed.
[436:37.54]Just zone him.
[436:39.81]Get some, get... You know how to start every fight.
[436:43.37]You can't change it any other way.
[436:46.83]Do it the way that you have to start every single fight.
[436:48.43]You know how to start it, and you hit it.
[436:51.55]It's alright.
[436:52.11]It's okay.
[436:52.53]Just get in there.
[436:54.12]Good.

[436:58.60]Do it again.
[436:59.72]Pull out.
[437:00.42]Pull it out.
[437:03.82]Zone him.

[437:53.36]On a scale of slightly irritated to very tired on the moon ring.
[438:01.43]The mood ring scale.
[438:07.21]It would have been funny if I closed the deal on that one, but I didn't.
[438:18.73]I've been streaming for, like, eight hours.

[438:40.21]Yeah.
[438:41.11]I mean, come on.
[438:42.29]You deserve it.
[438:48.23]Fuse him and end.
[438:51.84]No, he's... We're taking him to A. You just got meat.
[438:57.12]Back to fish with you.
[438:58.38]No, actually, not tablets.

[439:03.82]We can afford it.
[439:04.32]We got 10 grand.
[439:15.17]Is he too old for tablets?
[439:17.17]No, you're never too old for tablets.
[439:21.96]Too old for tablets?
[439:22.86]I still eat Flintstones vitamins.
[439:24.92]Am I too old for those?
[439:26.78]I just never stopped eating them.
[439:29.90]There's something about them.
[439:30.82]I'm addicted to them.
[439:31.54]It's kind of weird.
[439:41.81]Oh, here comes the birthday song!
[439:45.49]eat those give me a break I drink alkaline water to balance my system it's strong and even much stronger you wanker that wasn't bad I bet mr ice cream likes it
[440:16.04]Does he?
[440:17.18]Yes, he does.
[440:24.22]Dude, is this going to be the first... I think it... Yeah, I think it might.
[440:27.67]This might be the first ever 10-hour livestream I've ever done.
[440:31.77]It's probably going to happen.
[440:33.65]What's the longest stream I've ever done?
[440:36.87]The Karazhan stream was more than 8 hours, right?
[440:43.37]This is probably going to be the longest... It doesn't look well these days.
[440:46.80]I guess we have to consider its retirement.
[440:48.60]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[440:49.66]What are you talking about?
[440:52.70]Retirement?
[440:55.18]Is Jeremy here?
[440:55.96]Excuse me, but who are you?
[440:59.92]I'm Kavaro.
[441:01.32]You could say I'm a treasure hunter who travels to historic remains in all kinds of places.
[441:06.59]I have some business to discuss with Jeremy.
[441:10.67]Really?
[441:10.93]Okay.
[441:11.05]Okay.
[441:11.97]You mean Mr. Ice Cream?
[441:13.17]Aha!
[441:13.33]Mr. Ice Cream has gone on many adventures before.
[441:14.91]And I'll pay good money, too.
[441:15.77]Wait a minute.
[441:16.33]What should we do?
[441:16.79]Go.
[441:16.85]Has he slept?
[441:17.17]This is one chance we get.
[441:19.23]I don't care.
[441:40.34]Great.
[441:41.16]Then we should leave immediately.
[441:43.74]I'm all ready to go.
[441:44.92]But I want one of you to come with me.
[441:46.38]I'll go with you.
[441:47.40]You're the one who wants to go.
[441:48.70]Okay.
[441:49.68]Let's go, young lady.
[441:50.56]Yes, let's go.
[441:54.74]Die on a high note.
[441:57.80]No, we're going to do the B tournament.
[441:59.30]I'm getting the goddamn monster to goddamn A rank.
[442:02.30]Goddamn it.
[442:02.84]There we go.
[442:04.67]Search for the secret treasure.
[442:07.61]We finally arrived at the jungle.
[442:11.31]Set up base camp.
[442:13.22]Done.
[442:13.62]Let's get started.
[442:14.16]Don't be impatient.
[442:14.90]Don't be in such a rush.
[442:16.30]There is no guarantee of survival unless we come back.
[442:18.58]Before exhausting all of your monster's energy points, don't fuck around.
[442:23.74]Alright.
[442:24.72]Forward.
[442:25.36]Forward.
[442:26.34]Right.
[442:26.94]Right.
[442:28.54]I see a moat.
[442:31.88]I see a moat.
[442:33.70]Break it.
[442:37.38]You're great.
[442:39.15]Okay, let's go this way.
[442:40.39]Let's wrap around.
[442:44.81]I see clean water.
[442:46.87]No, that was just a chunk error from Minecraft.
[442:53.68]We can't go any further.
[442:55.38]Move it.
[442:59.46]No, do you want to continue?
[443:00.42]We can't move it.
[443:01.54]Alright, that's fine.
[443:02.26]Let's go this way.
[443:04.95]Get to that ancient moat.
[443:13.28]Oh no, did I just fuck myself?
[443:20.69]I think I may have just fucked myself.
[443:22.57]I can't go that way, right?
[443:31.93]50 energy spent.
[443:33.17]I have to go all the way back, huh?
[443:35.21]Can I break the... I think I screwed myself.
[443:41.41]Where am I going to go from here?
[443:44.06]There's the moat right here.
[443:45.20]Can I do anything with this?
[443:48.84]Giant pumpkin.
[443:52.88]Yep.
[443:53.28]Found it.
[443:57.24]Move it.
[443:57.50]Ugh.
[443:58.20]Ugh.
[444:01.00]Shit.
[444:01.36]Okay, well, we can go this way.
[444:04.68]Are you fucking serious?
[444:12.15]This is bad.
[444:27.76]Come on, do it.
[444:33.61]The hell is this thing?
[444:38.75]Wow, what is this?
[444:40.49]Um, it's shaped like a huge elephant tusk.
[444:42.31]Let's call it Tusk Tower.
[444:44.31]I'm excited about the treasures that may be hidden inside.
[444:48.69]Go in there.
[444:49.13]Alright, unlock... Just unlock the chest in Skyrim, please.
[444:53.87]Ugh.
[444:55.05]Ugh.
[445:03.25]Just unlock it.
[445:05.32]He's so dumb.
[445:10.51]I can only do this like one or two more times.
[445:12.07]Oh my god, you're going the same way.
[445:31.51]Energy, energy, energy, energy, energy.
[445:33.61]That's right.
[445:35.95]Don't, don't get to me.
[445:36.97]Get out of there.
[445:37.35]73.
[445:37.45]Oh, fuck.
[445:43.31]I gotta go home.
[445:45.87]Get me home.
[445:47.37]How do I get home?
[445:47.93]Which is the way to get home?
[445:48.73]This way?
[445:50.51]How do I get home?
[445:53.51]No, no, no, no, no.
[445:54.56]Go up.
[445:58.68]How do I go home?
[446:02.01]Okay, I got it.
[446:07.87]Where is it?
[446:10.51]Phew!
[446:11.43]Okay.
[446:35.29]I didn't get anything.
[446:56.02]Could have rolled the dice another time.
[446:59.18]Does intelligence have something to play with that, or is it just random?
[447:08.72]Well, at least we got paid.
[447:09.60]At least we made money.
[447:19.00]What?
[447:20.89]No, he died!
[447:21.89]No!
[447:23.51]Rewind!
[447:24.39]Rewind!
[447:24.99]See you later!
[447:25.49]We're going back!
[447:26.61]He turned blue!
[447:34.64]No, he was the best!
[447:36.20]He was so good!
[447:38.55]He was so good.
[447:39.63]How did we let this happen?
[447:43.25]There's his dead body.
[447:44.53]What's wrong, Mr. Ice Cream?
[447:52.97]Colt, I'm sorry about Mr. Ice Cream.
[447:57.08]It is said every living creature will die someday.
[447:59.42]We can't fight against nature.
[448:00.86]Do you understand?
[448:04.08]He died of natural causes.
[448:05.60]He got so many tablets!
[448:06.78]They gave him so many flintstone vitamins!
[448:08.24]This is bullshit!
[448:11.92]Its soul lives.
[448:13.14]How about holding a funeral ceremony for it and building an altar in order to pray for its soul?
[448:20.45]Yes, let's hold a funeral ceremony.
[448:27.38]Thank you.
[448:33.84]Try not to be so disheartened.
[448:36.23]Auntie, thank you.
[448:38.85]Well, I'm sorry.
[448:40.23]Mr. Ice Cream was a great fighter.
[448:42.65]Yes, thank you for everything.
[448:45.65]I'm so sorry.
[448:46.29]Mr. Ice Cream was a good monster.
[448:48.68]Yes, thank you for taking the time to come, Dr. Talico.
[448:52.56]Goodbye, Mr. Only two people came to his funeral?
[448:56.32]That...
[448:58.52]Mr. Ice Cream.
[448:59.42]He was three years and one month.
[449:00.80]He was ranked B.
[449:01.34]241, 336, 159, 280, 212, 162.
[449:02.94]He was 39 and 9 with 24 KOs.
[449:03.92]That was better than Mike Tyson.
[449:05.44]Mr. Ice Cream is gone.
[449:06.38]Let's come and visit here once in a while.
[449:36.36]Do you know how happy everything is?
[449:37.86]Remember this music?
[449:39.78]Ho ho ho ho!
[449:40.48]Welcome back to town!
[449:41.56]Did you know somebody just died?
[449:44.16]Would you like to see a balloon animal?
[449:46.56]Now what the fuck am I gonna do?
[449:58.14]I could go back and fuse him.
[450:01.42]So now, can I unlock somebody else?
[450:12.22]Let's go back.
[450:15.78]Three years is bad?
[450:17.62]What did I do to him?
[450:18.76]I treated him so well.
[450:19.70]He was even the whole time.
[450:20.93]He ate a lot of good food.
[450:23.61]What did I do?
[450:24.17]No, I'm fusing him.
[450:28.17]Are you kidding me?
[450:30.43]He's coming back to life.
[450:34.41]We're going to perform some human transmutation.
[450:45.95]No, that was a lot of work.
[450:46.83]I'm fusing him.
[450:49.51]I gave him drugs.
[450:50.51]Well, I gave him drugs... Look, I only gave him drugs when he was a baby.
[450:55.87]Not more than that.
[451:04.79]Back to town.
[451:13.30]What better time?
[451:20.49]Is this a pre or post B rank tournament?
[451:22.87]This is pre B rank.
[451:25.88]So we have to freeze him and see what we can get from these two.
[451:28.06]Because whatever it is, it's kind of what we're doing.
[451:37.47]He's huge too.
[451:49.26]I mean, like, let's just see what we're gonna get.
[451:51.21]If I, if I do, if I get to B rank, I have Mr. Ice Cream and Kira.
[452:01.11]Let's put a seasoning in there.
[452:02.15]Uh, let's do, I mean, plants.
[452:08.67]We could do the chips of plants, just see what it does.
[452:13.72]Okay, um, the prospect of this combination is good.
[452:17.84]Look forward to it.
[452:22.84]How?
[452:23.16]Is that how?
[452:26.36]We could get a striker out of this.
[452:28.54]Or a mint.
[452:36.97]Spin the dog around and have the dog go first.
[452:48.20]Yeah, they all look pretty normal.
[452:53.45]We'll do the plant disc again.
[453:02.64]Prospect is this combination is good.
[453:04.06]All right.
[453:04.68]I mean, we already... No, we got to spin that around.
[453:09.10]I don't want another just default Kabalos.
[453:13.09]The staffs are probably really good.
[453:16.45]Okay.
[453:18.37]I'm going to spin it around.
[453:19.35]I want to try to go for one of the other ones.
[453:20.87]I'd like Mint or Striker or something.
[453:27.32]Plant Disc adds two months of lifespan.
[453:36.22]Yeah, I'm going to spin it around.
[453:47.10]The first monster's moves are kept.
[453:52.58]Let me save it.
[453:55.92]Because getting, like, a striker sounds kind of cool.
[454:04.20]We'll save Scummet, just because this is the first time we've had two large, good monsters in the same place.
[454:18.38]Plant discs make it immortal.
[454:21.46]That's pretty fucking cool.
[454:22.32]Let's do that.
[454:35.61]Striker is a better ripper, which is Ice Cream Man.
[454:39.53]I'm okay with that.
[454:42.99]He's going to be a different flavored ice cream?
[454:48.18]Let's just see what we get.
[454:52.78]Mr. Ice Cream and Kira.
[454:55.49]With the plant.
[455:05.57]Okay.
[455:06.05]Hold on.
[455:07.01]What about... What about the zoom disc?
[455:12.31]What does that do for me?
[455:13.79]Plant adds life.
[455:14.67]What does the zoom do?
[455:24.28]stats maybe I should just get more stats uh zoom is plus one symbol on run drills oh that's cool so you get you get a plus one on running
[455:52.14]I'd rather do this than the extra lifespan.
[455:55.02]10 weeks is a lot better.
[455:55.90]Is it, though?
[455:59.84]Easier to gain life?
[456:01.06]I'm gonna go with this.
[456:02.02]Let's just do it.
[456:04.82]I like the plus one.
[456:08.33]My guys have not been living long enough anyways.
[456:09.89]Alright, we're looking for a striker or a mint.
[456:14.13]Do it up.
[456:20.35]Striker.
[456:25.00]Mint?
[456:27.46]No, it's this dumb thing.
[456:28.61]What are the stats, though?
[456:35.05]That's just awful.
[456:43.71]We'll try it with plant.
[456:50.50]Oh, I forgot about my reaction.
[456:51.48]Yeah.
[457:00.29]Forgot to put the webcam on.
[457:04.53]Pixies are the best.
[457:05.25]Yeah, but I don't want to use a pixie.
[457:11.81]Lifespan, not life step.
[457:15.19]It's all good.
[457:27.01]Star Ice Cream.
[457:29.15]And Kuro.
[457:31.72]Secret ingredient.
[457:33.00]Let's put in the other one.
[457:35.12]Plant disk.
[457:37.94]Alright, let's get a good one.
[457:40.64]Prospect is going to be a good combination.
[457:43.84]Oh, that's way too big.
[457:49.69]Do it.
[457:51.61]Striker.
[458:00.34]Striker!
[458:01.80]Striker!
[458:05.78]Looks like Venom from Spider-Man.
[458:10.93]185, 208.
[458:13.55]Perfect.
[458:17.13]Looking good.
[458:24.23]Now he's got VB's colors.
[458:28.93]Sonic lives on.
[458:33.92]Mr. Sonic man Stretch Armstrong Blueberry CB BB.
[458:51.25]I like it CB BB cold brew blueberry Because that could also be beanbags on CB BBS I
[459:02.11]Cold Brew Beanbag Sonic.
[459:05.09]No, that's not good.
[459:08.03]How about Blue Pickle Rick?
[459:13.95]This has got to be a good one because this is the last monster that I'm going to play with in this game.
[459:17.96]Essentially.
[459:26.20]How about Blueberry?
[459:28.66]How about...
[459:31.23]How about Quadratic?
[459:32.99]I like that one.
[459:33.77]Fuck the Quadratic.
[459:56.99]Yep.
[459:58.07]You think you can fuck with a guy named Quadratic?
[460:01.14]What do you mean that's a horrible name?
[460:12.30]Yeah.
[460:12.72]Quadratic BBS.
[460:23.17]Boo.
[460:28.26]You fucked up.
[460:29.30]You fucked up.
[460:35.77]I fucked up, but you know what?
[460:37.51]It's time to train him.
[460:39.85]Quadratic BBS.
[460:47.03]How did I have to give him that stupid clan tag?
[460:49.13]I liked quadratic.
[460:52.87]The stats are amazing.
[460:55.83]Oh, we can look at his moves, too.
[461:04.92]that's amazing starting stats oh and he already right off the bat has pierce stab all we need is just to get the drill and we can just smoke tournaments I could probably enter him in a tournament right now and just start winning all right let me let me just like let me take a break I've been turning for like eight hours any moment uh no song I've heard back I'm gonna get a water
[461:34.11]blink my eyes a few times and I'll be back in like two minutes.
[464:31.19]I got some food, too.
[464:37.10]Mm!
[464:44.20]Mm-hmm.
[464:47.08]So... Well, I'd probably say to make it so we're not all, like... I don't want everybody to...
[465:04.89]lose sleep because it's almost two o'clock in the morning eastern which means it's probably really late for a lot of people so probably not going to go more than an hour that was eight nine I don't know but doing a 10-hour stream sounds like an achievement I've never done before so maybe I want to do that all right let me ask you this guys those of you that are here so uh sorry I'm eating a salad
[465:38.40]Would you guys rather?
[465:39.24]Because if I stream, if I stream for 10 hours right now, I'm probably not going to be able to, I'm not going to stream today, tomorrow.
[465:44.88]It'll be, it'll be today.
[465:51.38]So would you rather the stream stop like now or go for like another two plus hours and then I stream on Thursday?
[466:03.29]What do you think?
[466:13.35]Go for it.
[466:18.27]I'm going to do a poll.
[466:19.49]Let's actually do this democratically because if I stream for 10 fucking hours, I'm not going to be able to stream tomorrow.
[466:27.40]I'm going to be fucking tired as shit.
[466:28.54]If I go for like 10, 12 hours of a stream, I'm going to be zonked.
[466:34.54]You won't see me for a whole day.
[466:40.59]Let's see.
[466:45.64]He won't stream tomorrow anyway.
[466:47.46]That's not true.
[466:51.40]Keep going or see you tomorrow.
[467:01.83]Let's see.
[467:05.49]What do you guys think?
[467:14.26]Well, I'm surprised that this is straight up 50-50 right now.
[467:23.15]This is extremely close.
[467:36.58]Keep going.
[467:37.06]Seems to be pulling ahead a little bit here.
[467:43.21]The plow is gonna hit your private internet generator Well, and the reason why I'm doing this it's because it's really up in the air if I'm gonna be able to stream Tomorrow night into Thursday anyways So maybe it is, you know, maybe it is a better idea just to keep going
[468:09.28]Because I actually can't guarantee that I will be live on Thursday night.
[468:14.44]So, you know.
[468:19.83]Alright, well, I'm going to close this here in about 10 seconds.
[468:23.35]If you haven't voted and you want to vote, it's there.
[468:32.23]Oh, I will not be playing this game on the next stream, by the way.
[468:38.48]We're going with this game.
[468:41.00]And after this stream ends.
[468:42.78]This one here.
[468:43.54]I'm not playing Monster Rancher 2.
[468:45.74]Again.
[468:50.04]So we're going to move on to other stuff.
[468:58.94]Ever.
[468:59.38]No.
[469:06.06]Then it must be.
[469:08.40]Well... Sorry for those of you that are probably going to sleep.
[469:14.88]We'll keep going.
[469:15.84]We'll try to get this guy up a little bit.
[469:21.65]This guy should get to A rank.
[469:25.47]He's got... His base stats are so much better than the last guy we were using.
[469:33.91]Let me just quickly finish the rest of this salad.
[469:40.17]And we will go.
[469:48.01]A rank or death.
[469:52.62]Well, I think I'll be able to get to D and C very quickly.
[469:56.46]If you want to see his stats are there.
[470:06.65]Having over 200 intelligence.
[470:09.55]Oh, sorry, skill.
[470:12.13]At level zero?
[470:13.29]At one year old?
[470:14.31]Zero years old?
[470:15.95]That's... I don't have to level that up for, like, a year.
[470:21.73]I still might, though.
[470:22.42]Oh, we got some new advice from Potion?
[470:28.90]What was it?
[470:32.44]Yeah, those of you guys that are going to sleep, have a great rest of your night.
[470:36.89]Have a good sleep.
[470:39.16]I will probably end up seeing you all hopefully... The weather doesn't do anything terrible.
[470:48.72]Then Thursday.
[470:51.70]But... Those of you guys that are staying... We push on.
[471:02.67]So you're gonna miss another stream?
[471:05.09]I don't know.
[471:05.77]We're getting another 15 inches of snow, apparently.
[471:07.83]Like, we're getting 10 inches of snow, and there's going to be a ton of wind.
[471:10.07]And it seems like the last three snowstorms, with the high wind, I lose power every time.
[471:13.95]I've had, in the month of March, I have not had power for probably, like, a week of March.
[471:23.70]Like, into that last week of February, into the first week of March.
[471:28.72]And last week.
[471:30.58]I just didn't have power for three days.
[471:31.88]Didn't have power for three days.
[471:33.16]Didn't have power for two days.
[471:35.58]It's just been a pain in the fucking ass.
[471:39.58]Almost done.
[471:44.02]I'm located in Massachusetts.
[471:50.58]It's been annoying.
[471:51.18]I had to throw my fridge away.
[471:58.09]Full of food.
[471:58.91]Twice.
[472:01.32]Because I was like, there's no way, there's no possible reason why we lose power again.
[472:07.32]Lost it three days later.
[472:08.42]Or four days later, whatever.
[472:12.25]Something like that.
[472:12.77]So I'm so paranoid.
[472:20.21]I've been just ordering takeout for the last two to three days straight.
[472:25.29]Because I'm terrified to go to the grocery store.
[472:31.64]I'm gonna go to the grocery store and I'm gonna throw my whole fridge away again.
[472:41.24]Okay.
[472:42.98]We're good.
[472:44.12]That was a tasty spinach, chicken, and bacon salad.
[472:49.06]I got my water.
[472:51.12]Here we go.
[472:59.64]Don't stress out new BB.
[473:03.24]I will not.
[473:04.44]I'm going to be very, very careful, very cautious with new baby.
[473:16.53]Canned food never goes bad.
[473:17.97]I mean, I have canned food.
[473:21.93]But there's only so many times you can eat cold Campbell's chicken noodle soup out of the jar before it makes you want to throw up.
[473:37.78]Make sure you never give him a mint leaf every single week.
[473:41.74]You got it.
[473:43.70]Uh, we can... He's a little baby, so we're gonna do just basic drills, right?
[473:48.24]And we're gonna do... Um, skill, speed.
[473:52.08]We'll do power.
[473:52.50]We'll get power to two, uh... Power to 200.
[474:00.34]It's cold outside.
[474:01.16]My fridge doesn't work.
[474:03.59]Um...
[474:06.42]I mean, yeah.
[474:08.16]Could I, like, put my entire fridge outside?
[474:12.28]I'm sure I could, but it would kind of ruin everything.
[474:17.04]You want me to put, like, cold-cut turkey, deli turkey, outside in the snow?
[474:23.34]I'm not gonna eat... You want me to eat frozen deli turkey?
[474:30.53]Mint week every other week, not every week.
[474:33.47]Okay.
[474:38.25]We are not going to scold him here.
[474:48.48]Why did I name... I don't know why I named him this.
[474:52.90]Should we... He needs milk and shit, right?
[474:55.06]Should I give him tablets?
[474:58.05]Will this increase his life and his existence?
[475:04.21]Tablets versus milk.
[475:05.67]Early.
[475:06.75]What's better?
[475:14.06]fridge with snow.
[475:19.50]I'm doing tablets.
[475:30.08]Alright, yeah, Potions wants me to do it on my own.
[475:33.76]I will listen.
[475:35.32]See how well I can manage this.
[475:42.43]Give him a frozen turkey.
[475:45.48]He's well.
[475:46.76]Okay, take a rest.
[475:48.64]Don't overwork yourself.
[475:50.26]Got plenty of time.
[475:52.50]I'm not gonna help either.
[475:53.58]Oh no, everyone's leaving.
[475:55.18]All my crutches are leaving.
[475:56.50]That's very well.
[475:59.42]We got a tournament here.
[476:01.66]We actually need to look at him.
[476:04.28]What does he like and dislike?
[476:06.72]He likes milk and doesn't like jelly.
[476:08.50]Well, that's great.
[476:09.60]That's awesome because that makes every feeding extremely cheap.
[476:14.68]Good.
[476:20.14]keep the fridge closed and live in arizona we have to throw well I didn't have to when when I did look when I didn't have power for four days in a row even when this it wasn't cold outside so yeah the first day or two you don't I don't throw anything away but once it gets to be like three days with no power and outside is no longer
[476:43.42]You know some of those days after we lost power were it was like 40 50 degrees 55 degrees outside sometimes so it can't You can't keep anything for more than four days.
[476:54.50]It just goes bad All right, let's do let's battle He's got a little loyalty no, you know what let's do this right stay out of the tournament I
[477:17.44]Try to get some monsters unlocked by getting an A rank so you can transfer them to three.
[477:21.06]That- that's- that's a- we'll try to do that.
[477:23.14]I'm gonna- before I turn the stream off, we're gonna really try and not fuck around.
[477:26.98]I'm gonna try to actually get to A rank.
[477:34.34]Should have ate everything in two days.
[477:35.50]I did.
[477:35.92]I ate most of it.
[477:38.57]The only stuff I really threw away was some of the food that, like, had to be at a certain temperature.
[477:54.08]Let's go.
[477:57.16]Let's train a little bit.
[477:58.10]Let's do power.
[478:03.56]He lives in the Alaska of America.
[478:07.45]No, Massachusetts just has the worst of all seasons.
[478:17.23]He's well.
[478:17.89]Right now, we're going to give him a mint leaf.
[478:25.08]Just chill.
[478:26.62]Take it.
[478:27.52]Don't get stressed.
[478:33.20]Good night, Kairatobi.
[478:34.92]Thanks for sticking around for as long as you have.
[478:39.13]Let's rest.
[478:42.79]Already at 15 loyalty.
[478:44.25]Hopefully we keep it going.
[478:49.05]An average day is like 70 to 80.
[478:50.59]That sounds absolutely incredible.
[478:54.22]I wish I could be in a 70 to 80 every day.
[478:56.91]Where do you live?
[478:57.47]That's amazing.
[478:59.13]That's incredible.
[478:59.81]Where are you?
[479:00.93]I'm coming to live in your town.
[479:02.97]What state do you live in?
[479:08.36]Let's do another training.
[479:10.30]Domino.
[479:15.58]I'm coming to live in your fridge.
[479:25.83]L.A.
[479:26.03]ranges from 50 to 100.
[479:26.91]Yeah, L.A.
[479:27.69]is hot.
[479:34.75]Austin, 70-ish.
[479:35.45]Let's go with the milk.
[479:40.13]Because he likes milk.
[479:46.91]Jeremy's going to come live in my house.
[479:48.39]Oh, God.
[479:55.11]He's going to live in your fridge and eat all your soup jars.
[479:59.77]You have mail.
[480:00.31]This looks like our first potential errand tree.
[480:04.77]But I'm not going to... I don't know if I want to do this.
[480:07.78]He might be too young.
[480:09.68]How old is he?
[480:12.46]One month old.
[480:13.94]It's not time.
[480:15.48]It's not time.
[480:15.96]It just isn't time, guys.
[480:22.86]Let's rest him up.
[480:25.85]Train, get the 200 power.
[480:34.76]I'm going to go buy up all the leaves and I'm going to sell the other chips.
[480:40.38]I'm going to stock it up.
[480:44.13]He's going to immediately fight soft shit.
[480:47.95]I'm going to get a snake.
[480:57.91]Such a balancing act.
[480:59.67]What is this?
[481:00.91]If you like it, get some.
[481:05.45]Let's sell some of the chips.
[481:07.63]Let's sell these.
[481:08.47]No, actually... Yeah, get rid of this shit.
[481:14.43]I'm not making another monster, so... That's kind of the way it is, right?
[481:21.12]I'm not going to be making another one.
[481:24.30]Moki disk.
[481:24.68]Moki disk.
[481:27.79]Then they have something else, too.
[481:39.32]Let's get money so I can train and have, uh... Keep the flower just for some... Well, who cares?
[481:51.13]Could take a star prune.
[481:52.91]Not now, though.
[481:58.75]Let's get a ton of money.
[482:07.82]Anything else I have that's expensive?
[482:10.98]No.
[482:11.70]I mean star prune, but... No, let's buy some... Buy some mangoes.
[482:21.67]And then a bunch of mint leaves.
[482:28.41]Fill the bag.
[482:33.44]While they're cheap, because I know I'm going to use them.
[482:35.62]All of these.
[482:36.04]Okay, that's good.
[482:41.14]Very cool.
[482:42.16]So... Am I still hiding in chat?
[482:45.28]Are you doing the thing?
[482:46.08]Oh, so... That's going to happen probably next week.
[482:49.14]Got to get the whole thing.
[482:49.74]Got to get the command set up.
[482:50.72]Got to get the whole thing set up.
[482:51.74]It's going to take a little while.
[482:54.16]So, back to training.
[482:56.34]Power.
[482:57.31]Go for it.
[483:06.51]The hydration bot is real?
[483:07.91]What do you mean it's real?
[483:13.42]It's an actual thing?
[483:16.06]Back to even, good.
[483:19.63]This time, do it right.
[483:23.37]Have I ever been to Connecticut?
[483:24.31]Oh yeah, plenty of times.
[483:28.63]Connecticut's great.
[483:30.14]Connecticut's great.
[483:31.30]I can't say syllables right now.
[483:38.09]Seems well.
[483:38.83]It's given another tea leaf, right?
[483:41.51]I don't want to stress about.
[483:52.46]It's not a meme.
[483:53.12]I don't know why you think nutritional health is a joke.
[483:58.76]Battle.
[483:59.30]This one's F. I could probably go right to D, but we'll do this one.
[484:10.95]See how he does in battle.
[484:13.33]Hopefully we get enough loyalty by then.
[484:20.71]Gonna run out of money?
[484:21.39]Uh, no.
[484:22.07]I got plenty of money.
[484:25.13]God damn it.
[484:35.39]I got plenty of hydration.
[484:38.02]More tablets.
[484:41.84]I got a water right here.
[484:48.25]Seems like there's a lot less people in here than there really is.
[484:53.07]I'm probably going to attribute that to the fact that it is like over 2 o'clock in the morning Eastern.
[484:58.51]Most people are probably just hanging out.
[485:02.50]Not necessarily chatting, but it's open somewhere.
[485:07.96]Something like that.
[485:10.61]Drink the whole entire supply on camera.
[485:19.12]No one will be ever as charismatic as BBS.
[485:23.08]Hanging out equals sleeping.
[485:26.70]Just relaxing and lurking.
[485:27.86]That's what I have to assume.
[485:29.73]Is it late?
[485:30.29]It's really fucking late.
[485:34.19]Laying in bed.
[485:35.33]Yeah, makes sense.
[485:40.71]What is my... Do it again.
[485:45.71]Get to power to 200 and then we'll fight.
[485:48.12]Don't fail it.
[485:52.32]Good.
[485:56.52]That's it?
[485:56.86]Alright, he's tired.
[486:01.67]Let him rest.
[486:05.46]West Coast.
[486:06.84]Yeah, I feel like all the people that are alert right now in chat are probably mostly West Coast United States.
[486:15.87]It's so late I'm fighting a bot thinking it's a meme.
[486:23.93]I want power over 200 before I do a damn thing.
[486:31.37]Finally.
[486:32.35]Good.
[486:32.55]200.
[486:32.97]On the dot.
[486:35.05]Let's fight.
[486:37.93]He's well.
[486:39.51]When's the next battle?
[486:41.99]Right here.
[486:42.37]Official cup.
[486:43.07]Let's get it done.
[486:47.49]So let's rest.
[486:53.26]Do a some maybe some defense.
[487:04.96]New tablets again.
[487:06.50]I have the money.
[487:07.06]I'm going to do it.
[487:09.16]Once I get him past his toddler phase, I'm not going to give tablets anymore.
[487:15.56]I'm going to start giving milk.
[487:21.00]Official tournament.
[487:24.23]We're already at 32 loyalty.
[487:25.31]This is going well.
[487:28.93]So, what does he look like now?
[487:32.37]Speed.
[487:32.77]We'll do some speed.
[487:37.41]He's pretty desperate for it.
[487:41.77]What do the tablets do?
[487:42.63]The tablets are just the best food in the entire game.
[487:47.54]No, you failed.
[487:51.14]Do not scold.
[487:51.94]I mean, if it's going to be quadratic BBS, then he'd be better... He'd better be good at speed.
[488:06.65]You don't give babies drugs, you give them warm milk.
[488:14.60]Let's give him some tea.
[488:26.70]Moo just reminded me that you're gonna have 10 hours of bits to read after this.
[488:30.34]Oh shit.
[488:32.00]I didn't even realize that.
[488:33.84]I'm gonna be at the 10 hour mark and just be reading bits for like 3 hours.
[488:38.69]Oh shit.
[488:40.57]That did not cross my mind until right now.
[488:42.49]10 hours of bits.
[488:53.02]Oh boy.
[488:55.57]And subs.
[488:56.59]10 hour long credits.
[489:03.39]Well, now it's a 13 hour stream.
[489:05.22]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[489:14.00]The one drawback of reading donations at the end of a stream.
[489:24.14]Uh, he's too young for an Errantry.
[489:27.51]Get that speed.
[489:29.07]I know you can do it.
[489:35.37]10 hours of bits.
[489:37.05]Start it now?
[489:39.31]How long?
[489:39.67]How much do we have, really?
[489:40.73]Like, actually, realistically?
[489:45.20]Oh, man.
[489:46.22]Yeah, alright, we're gonna... This is gonna be a bit-reading portion of the stream.
[489:54.07]Alright, just train him and we'll do the bits.
[489:55.99]We'll start him now.
[489:56.83]Because this is going to take a long time.
[489:58.73]We'll just go real slow.
[490:00.19]Official tournament.
[490:02.55]Seems to be good in shape.
[490:03.35]What is he?
[490:03.93]He's well.
[490:05.31]He's well.
[490:06.79]Let's do it.
[490:10.86]Turn on text-to-speech.
[490:14.28]First of all, thank you to Sticktronigate for the $1.
[490:16.10]That feeling when... No, I already got these.
[490:18.30]I got at least the first half of these.
[490:21.68]Yeah, I got these.
[490:26.67]Yeah, I got these.
[490:28.37]We can skip, like, 30 minutes.
[490:34.05]Thank you, Djack, for the $1.
[490:37.74]Thanks for being something different in a world of streamers playing Fortnite for 15 hours a day.
[490:44.66]Yeah, instead you get Monster Rancher for 15 hours in a day.
[490:48.86]Thanks, dude.
[490:51.34]Thank you also to CairoToby.
[490:52.53]They left already.
[490:53.23]Cairo left, but...
[490:55.17]Been a big supporter of the stream.
[490:57.43]Thank you, Cairo.
[490:58.05]Oh, that means I can skip all of his bits.
[491:00.09]He's not even here anymore.
[491:01.99]Hey, thank you, Cairo.
[491:02.83]Toby, thanks for the bits.
[491:04.17]I know you're not even here, so we're gonna fucking skip his shit.
[491:08.73]No.
[491:09.59]Still read them.
[491:12.31]Thank you, Cairo.
[491:14.38]Hey, Jerma's back.
[491:15.14]Hope you're feeling better.
[491:15.74]I'm feeling good.
[491:19.14]I'm just kidding.
[491:19.82]Of course I'm gonna read them.
[491:22.39]He's going to see the VOD.
[491:23.43]No.
[491:27.25]Cairo Toby is giving a lot of money.
[491:29.81]Thanks a lot, man.
[491:31.89]Job Sure, thanks for the $1.
[491:33.11]Hey, German95, I've been watching you since way back in the day, and I'm glad to finally have subbed.
[491:36.87]Have a good one, man.
[491:37.75]Thank you, Job Sure.
[491:40.25]That's very kind of you.
[491:41.07]Look at these stats here, by the way.
[491:42.71]This is just going to be a free match.
[491:46.29]He already has Stab right off the bat, and he's got Pierce.
[491:50.40]There's a little bit of foolery there.
[491:53.97]Yeah, all these E... Until we get to C, I could probably do... We'll get to C very, very quickly.
[492:01.52]And then we can focus on just spamming him up to B. This is going to be so easy.
[492:04.86]I'll do all the officials as soon as they happen.
[492:09.07]Yurt McBob, thanks for the $1.
[492:10.57]Thanks for being such a wonderful dude, Jerma.
[492:11.97]Thank you, McBob.
[492:12.85]Appreciate it, dude.
[492:15.71]Reptilian God, thanks for the $1.
[492:17.11]Have you thought of making merch?
[492:18.41]Personally, I'd like a Jerma-related shirt and supporting you would be a bonus.
[492:22.90]Yeah, I mean, there's a lot of random things that I want to do.
[492:26.48]It's just I have to pick one and actually do it.
[492:30.02]There's an idea that I have.
[492:31.74]I've had a bunch of ideas, but one in particular I think would be amazing.
[492:34.38]And it's late, so... And I'm tired, and I'm just going to tell you this because it's interesting.
[492:40.95]I don't know if it's ever going to happen, but it's super interesting and I want to do it.
[492:47.27]I want to do a... Now, don't take this again.
[492:49.17]Please don't take this as... In a week, you're going to be able to buy it!
[492:54.25]I want to do a booster packs of all like the characters that have been like on stream and in video and stuff so you can get a buy card packs completely custom made by tons of artists now you know you get like a like a golden glue man could be in them they'd be rare cards it wouldn't be a game so there wouldn't be any anything really you could do with them but it'd be like collectible cards of different characters in the whole the last like seven years
[493:22.47]of uh of the channel so that'd be fun there's a company that does it I would I would want like I would and that's the thing I'm such like a psycho perfectionist about weird stuff like this I would want like 100 to 200 cards like I would want like 100 cards in this in the day and like the full deck
[493:46.27]But then I thought about it more and more, and the more I think about it, they would have to be expensive.
[493:51.58]Because the amount of money that it takes to get a custom-made trading card set actually done correct.
[494:00.19]Because you can buy a booster pack at...
[494:04.42]Pokemon cards or magic cards for like $4.
[494:08.46]But I would have to take care of solely the manufacturing, the paying everybody, all the art would have to be commissioned.
[494:18.33]You're talking about thousands and thousands of thousands of dollars.
[494:22.29]Potentially more than $10,000 to $20,000 of overhead.
[494:25.57]So that would be something where the card packs would end up being like, oh, here's a booster pack.
[494:29.19]It's like $18 fucking dollars.
[494:32.58]That's just not realistic.
[494:38.89]But it was just an idea.
[494:39.97]Do a Kickstarter for it.
[494:50.67]Mint condition holographic cards.
[494:55.09]We can probably skip to see.
[494:59.83]I have to do the Patreon video first, and there's a lot that has to go into that video.
[495:06.80]There's a plan.
[495:07.60]It's just moving at a snail's pace because the real world moves in tiny, rusty cogwheels.
[495:17.04]If it were up to me, I would have had it uploaded on my main channel like three fucking months ago.
[495:28.61]257s of... Yeah, there would be a bunch of BS.
[495:30.85]There would have to be.
[495:34.07]Like a common card.
[495:37.47]But I could actually do real foil, beautiful, actually handcrafted, not cheapo dog shit.
[495:45.48]It would be real.
[495:46.12]It would be like getting a high quality metallic card and a deck.
[495:50.86]I wouldn't want it to be a piece of shit.
[495:56.50]But that was one of the ideas.
[495:59.36]Maybe more details will come out soon.
[496:00.68]But there's at least three, there's at least two or three artists that would do it.
[496:04.68]And I would want more than that.
[496:05.64]I'd want like a huge amount of people.
[496:07.24]Like maybe like five to ten completely different artists.
[496:10.30]Maybe even more than that.
[496:11.54]That were all commissioned out to do like five cards each.
[496:17.10]Ten cards each if they really wanted to.
[496:18.46]Whatever we could work out, you know.
[496:26.85]But it's an idea.
[496:29.35]I am going to Pax East, yes.
[496:30.99]If you're going there, I will at least be in the building.
[496:35.03]That's a promise.
[496:41.42]Can I use them as Yu-Gi-Oh cards?
[496:43.20]If you really wanted to.
[496:43.98]Available next week.
[496:54.01]See you next week!
[496:55.73]Apple, thanks, dude.
[496:56.63]Here's your merchandise question.
[496:58.15]Thank you, Apple Cooler, for the $1.
[497:00.80]It specifically says before you buy bits that you agree that you won't use bits to hide the source of the money.
[497:07.08]Peepy poo poo.
[497:10.02]Talking about the game show that we're doing next week to figure it out.
[497:16.29]Parsnips, thanks for the $1.
[497:17.41]If you need somewhere to hide your hot money, I'll DM you my debit card.
[497:21.45]By the way, bring back BBS.
[497:22.91]Here he is.
[497:24.96]His DNA is in here.
[497:29.54]Fake Grumbo, thanks for the $3.
[497:31.36]Hey Jeremy, I've been watching your videos since 2012 and I absolutely love your type of humor and what you do.
[497:36.10]Being in media production myself, I always see your work as an inspiration.
[497:39.63]Hope you don't mind that I've stolen a few of your jokes.
[497:42.11]You seem like a genuinely great guy and I think it's very admirable how hard you work for the content and how much you really do care for the fans and the community.
[497:49.37]If we ever cross paths, I'll be sure to buy you a beer.
[497:53.65]I'll gladly accept.
[497:56.79]Thank you, FakeRumbo.
[497:59.35]And you'll be hearing from my lawyer about those jokes that you stole.
[498:03.43]I don't take kindly to people taking my material.
[498:09.28]No.
[498:10.94]Just kidding.
[498:13.20]Always good to see another person in a media production type role.
[498:19.78]Good shit.
[498:20.95]I wish you luck, and thank you for being around since 2012.
[498:23.89]That's a long time, dude.
[498:26.69]In quotes, material.
[498:27.97]Old, busted material.
[498:34.13]Hey, give me a little bit of credit.
[498:39.62]Give me a little bit of credit, guys.
[498:40.62]I created the loot box.
[498:43.82]I have all the patents on it.
[498:44.64]What do you think I caught with the money from Monster Rancher?
[498:55.98]Thank you, Knock.
[498:57.07]Thank you, Knock, for the $1.
[498:59.83]If you ever do the money laundering stream, please do it on a Friday or Saturday night.
[499:03.59]It's almost impossible to participate in weekday streams when they're at 1 a.m.
[499:07.35]and at 5 a.m.
[499:08.45]Think of the Europeans.
[499:11.27]This would not be on a weekday.
[499:12.66]This would be either Friday night or on Saturday or Sunday.
[499:15.62]It would be one of those days where I know that most people would be able to go and participate and have fun.
[499:20.26]Don't worry about that.
[499:21.20]Thank you, though.
[499:23.31]CM Bree, thank you CM Bree for the $1.
[499:25.75]Play Garfield's Cart for the game show stream.
[499:27.47]You promised Garfield's Cart.
[499:28.63]Maybe I will just have it in there randomly for like 10 minutes.
[499:31.71]I gotta fucking find out how to play that dumb game.
[499:36.41]We are guaranteed to win, by the way.
[499:39.20]Radio Access, thanks for the $1.
[499:41.32]Did you steal my side mirror?
[499:46.06]No.
[499:47.38]No game audio?
[499:51.10]Why do you guys keep saying that?
[499:53.16]Everybody stop saying that.
[499:55.38]No game audio, it's right here.
[499:57.92]I'm so gullible.
[499:59.70]You could tell me my, you could tell me my house was green and I would believe you.
[500:05.12]It is?
[500:06.18]The house is green?
[500:09.82]That's crazy.
[500:10.82]I thought my house was a different color than that.
[500:13.00]Are you sure?
[500:15.40]It was too quiet.
[500:22.63]You turned it way up.
[500:26.29]How does that sound?
[500:28.31]Is that a better volume?
[500:31.43]For your precious ears.
[500:32.61]Oh, come on.
[500:37.66]Do it like your father did.
[500:39.32]He used to hit those almost all the time.
[500:41.90]Come on, do it like your dad did.
[500:44.64]Don't lose this.
[500:47.92]Dude, you gotta make this happen here.
[500:51.42]60% chance.
[500:52.50]Get it out.
[500:52.88]Come on.
[500:57.74]Dodge it.
[500:58.22]Nice work.
[501:01.84]Two offsprings of Sonic the Hedgehog.
[501:04.38]Double foolery in a row.
[501:05.48]Good thing I dodged that.
[501:06.82]Let's get a sure thing here.
[501:09.12]That's not what I wanted to do, but it's alright.
[501:10.58]We're gonna try it again, and we win anyways.
[501:12.16]Who cares?
[501:12.58]Tournament's over.
[501:17.31]Thank you to Cyanstar for the 25 cents.
[501:19.91]Papa German, you're going to go play Sea of Thieves.
[501:23.88]Maybe.
[501:24.20]I don't know.
[501:25.14]Me and Italics are going to play tonight, but I wasn't around in time.
[501:30.60]I've been equally parts unlucky and busy for three weeks.
[501:40.38]But I don't know.
[501:40.86]Maybe.
[501:41.48]I own it.
[501:43.34]You might see that eventually.
[501:44.34]There's a lot of things coming out.
[501:46.52]We've talked about it a couple times already.
[501:53.16]But, thank you for the 25 cents.
[501:54.94]Modder Wizard Dude.
[501:57.33]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[501:59.35]Local streamer under investigation for extreme animal abuse.
[502:05.87]No.
[502:07.56]These are monsters.
[502:09.62]Does this look like an animal?
[502:10.46]No.
[502:15.74]It's a fucking weird alien from outer space.
[502:24.70]Yes, they are.
[502:26.14]I mean, they are... That's an... What is that thing?
[502:29.72]What is this?
[502:30.24]That's a lot of fame.
[502:35.12]So, monster abuse.
[502:39.48]Yours is a monster, but the ones you're killing are animals.
[502:43.27]Now, the thing I just fought was a weird, like, Madagascar penguin, but blue.
[502:49.63]It was a penguin, but it's not a penguin.
[502:50.96]It has, like, a whale face, but that's an animal, too.
[502:52.78]Oh, whatever.
[503:01.74]Oh, whatever.
[503:06.04]Good work.
[503:07.42]But thank you so much, uh, Modern Wizard Dude.
[503:09.62]Thank you.
[503:11.24]Let's go with some milk this time.
[503:15.10]Bad Twitch 1245, thanks for the $5.
[503:18.28]Local streamer puppets dead animals for money.
[503:20.38]Here we are.
[503:22.28]Thank you, dude.
[503:22.78]Thank you Copper Shot for the 25 cents.
[503:24.54]Local streamer endorses cockfighting and throws endangered purple dog against... Oh, no.
[503:31.12]Hydra725, thanks for the $1.
[503:32.90]For one of your real-life videos, please do a stream adaptation of Clown in the Town.
[503:39.73]I actually would love to do that.
[503:40.95]It would be amazing, but...
[503:42.98]Legality.
[503:43.96]That would be bad.
[503:44.88]Wouldn't work.
[503:50.86]He's very well.
[503:53.70]Uh, but thank you.
[503:55.78]Thank you to CopperShot again for the 25 cents.
[503:57.52]You go, Pura.
[503:58.68]I supported you from the beginning.
[504:00.54]See, look at how much, how many fans he has now.
[504:05.12]I think, how old is he now?
[504:07.28]Are we good to do a, uh, to do some training here?
[504:13.35]When's the D... When's this D tournament?
[504:17.18]Not this one.
[504:17.74]We got this coming up here.
[504:18.86]It's the official D. So we got a while.
[504:21.68]I'm going to do an Errantry here.
[504:26.32]Let's do a Errantry.
[504:28.28]Heavy Errantry.
[504:29.72]Oh, no, no.
[504:30.06]Maybe... Was it six months, maybe?
[504:35.44]Local streamer streams locally.
[504:40.22]Yes.
[504:44.07]But thanks a lot, dude.
[504:46.87]Thank you, Coppershot, again for the $5.
[504:50.92]They say, bought $10 worth of bits, but just to support my favorite monster of the series.
[504:56.74]Go, Cura.
[504:57.36]I supported you from the beginning.
[505:03.48]Save it.
[505:09.24]Thank you so much, Coppershot.
[505:10.12]Appreciate it, man.
[505:13.65]Why am I... Why... Why... Don't... Don't save it.
[505:15.51]Why not?
[505:16.17]Why don't do it?
[505:16.95]Why not save it?
[505:17.93]Why wouldn't I?
[505:19.81]What the hell are you guys talking about?
[505:28.29]And... Bingo!
[505:34.50]Plus five.
[505:35.06]That's good.
[505:38.34]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer, for the 25 cents.
[505:40.50]Glad you're feeling better, Germs.
[505:41.46]The smaller kitten sure did miss you.
[505:44.19]They were looking forward to hearing their favorite streamer read the bits and play games.
[505:47.01]One of them wanted me to tell you he sings the rat birthday song at every birthday.
[505:51.19]Thanks for being joy to the little ones.
[505:52.65]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer.
[505:53.79]Appreciate it, man.
[505:54.41]Let's take another mint leaf.
[506:00.24]Am I running low on these?
[506:01.36]No, I got plenty.
[506:09.16]Yaddington, thanks for the 75 cents.
[506:10.46]Jeremiah, people have been storing illegal...
[506:13.86]porn in Bitcoin.
[506:15.16]Bitcoin will probably become illegal.
[506:18.84]Wait, what?
[506:23.22]Still... Oh, you're talking about like the... Talking about Bitcoin being, back in the day, was used for a lot of illicit fucked up things.
[506:36.73]I mean... What's the...
[506:43.56]People spend money on crazy shit, too.
[506:45.54]That's not cool.
[506:47.04]And fucking illegal.
[506:51.25]Are they really?
[506:51.75]Holy shit.
[506:54.11]It still is.
[506:54.83]They put it on the blockchain?
[506:59.21]What the fuck?
[507:01.62]Like, last week?
[507:03.82]I thought this was, like, fucking, like, four years ago.
[507:06.56]No, that's fucking crazy.
[507:18.65]I didn't hear about that.
[507:20.29]That's fucking nuts.
[507:22.47]I thought you were referring to like back in the day when Bitcoin was first being mined and people were like trading it back and forth and it was completely like private and nobody knew who the hell anybody was.
[507:34.36]No one explained to me what a blockchain is.
[507:36.52]I won't.
[507:41.69]Streamer deletes Ethereum link after Bitcoin scandal.
[507:48.27]Well, I don't own any Bitcoin, so it's all good.
[507:59.22]That's wild.
[508:00.22]That's crazy.
[508:05.50]But anyways, that's a very crazy, interesting bit of information I did not know.
[508:11.26]Fucked up and terrifying, to say the least, but...
[508:15.20]Uh, what was I gonna do with him?
[508:16.04]I was gonna train him to do one more shoot.
[508:18.51]Then I'm gonna put him to bed.
[508:32.07]Plus four.
[508:41.00]Uh... Thank you, Kairotobi, again.
[508:44.18]Hey Jerma, the combination will look good when both monsters have primary stats that match each other.
[508:48.48]I can see that.
[508:50.67]That's what we're trying to do now.
[508:54.71]Still going?
[508:55.23]Yeah, I'm going to go for 10 hours.
[508:57.53]Once we're at the 10 hour mark, I'm going to be gone.
[508:59.05]I'm going to do tablets this month.
[509:04.11]Let's go expensive.
[509:09.68]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer again.
[509:14.09]The little cousin cat told me to tell you that life is pain.
[509:17.44]He doesn't enjoy something.
[509:18.46]He always yells at me at the worst times.
[509:19.96]He does the Macarena incessantly.
[509:23.34]The other one wanted to say, Did I miss anything?
[509:27.00]The little ones are always happy to see their big cousin Garp.
[509:30.25]Thanks for inspiring the cats of all ages.
[509:31.91]Don't worry about the content.
[509:32.81]There are three lives into the cat cycle.
[509:35.81]What is this?
[509:38.99]What the fuck am I reading?
[509:44.45]What is going on in these messages?
[509:48.73]Oh my god.
[509:52.17]They're very endearing, actually.
[509:54.66]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer.
[509:57.90]For your bits and your stories about all the other cats in your life.
[510:05.08]Some person RPs as Garfield in Comic Land.
[510:07.86]It's great.
[510:08.34]I love it.
[510:11.07]Uh, when's the next... Let's do an Errantry.
[510:13.59]Let's get it going here.
[510:15.12]See if we can pull out a pot.
[510:16.20]I want to get the drill.
[510:17.50]See if we can do it.
[510:20.84]Power.
[510:22.28]There's a chance to get it.
[510:23.32]Just try.
[510:23.96]I want it.
[510:26.12]We're still E-level.
[510:32.87]See if we can get the drill back.
[510:37.90]Nice.
[510:38.32]Alright, we got some.
[510:38.83]I think that has to be it, right?
[510:40.59]No, it might be something else.
[510:44.23]Thank you, Jib the Great, for the 85 cents.
[510:46.39]Here's three quarters and a dime that I found when I was watching my favorite cell phone commercial over and over again.
[510:54.08]Uh-huh.
[510:55.86]I don't know what cell phone commercial that is, but hopefully it was interesting enough for you to watch it more than once.
[511:03.83]Uh, Samuel Sish, thanks for the one dollar.
[511:05.51]The green human centipede monster is literally just a pack of watermelon hubba bubba max.
[511:10.71]How is Tecmo not sued for this?
[511:14.57]Did he fail that?
[511:15.19]I don't know how he did... I don't know how the hell he did that.
[511:22.68]Satan's coming?
[511:23.34]No.
[511:24.12]He's too young for that.
[511:26.36]New technique, it seems pretty strong.
[511:27.82]Praise him!
[511:28.76]Sure thing.
[511:30.56]Alright, he's tired.
[511:31.18]We're gonna do mint leaf and put him to bed.
[511:39.18]That cell phone commercial comment is literally five plus hours old.
[511:42.52]You realize?
[511:46.16]I know, I know.
[511:48.13]But we're going through them.
[511:49.15]We're going through the snail's pace.
[511:52.87]Now he's going to get milk.
[511:58.69]Hubba Bubba Max?
[512:04.13]Why is he turning... Is he going transparent?
[512:05.85]He's like turning ethereal.
[512:09.55]He's tired, and I know he's- AHH!
[512:15.13]Stressed out.
[512:16.51]Dammit, this is the only- this is the first time he's ever been stressed out.
[512:19.46]In his whole life.
[512:21.08]So, I think he's gonna be fine.
[512:27.34]I saw that comment before I went to the rock and roll club at 6.
[512:29.98]It's now 11.30.
[512:39.77]Uh, hey, what happened?
[512:41.21]Just addressing shit so late.
[512:46.51]But I have been streaming for almost 10 hours, so, I mean, of course I'm gonna miss some of these things from this long ago.
[512:54.16]What do we got?
[512:54.68]There it is.
[512:55.70]Let's... I got a new... What's... Did I get the drill?
[513:00.88]If I got the drill, then this is completely its game over, and we're gonna win every time.
[513:05.39]Didn't get the drill.
[513:07.57]Damn it, I got Tail Assault.
[513:10.64]Shit.
[513:12.82]I'll have to do it again.
[513:16.13]Tail Assault, like, I'd rather have Pierce than Tail Assault, honestly.
[513:18.99]It does more damage, but this will just hit so much more often.
[513:26.64]Save it.
[513:36.46]Uh, let's keep going.
[513:37.97]With these bit donations.
[513:40.47]Blast him again.
[513:41.53]He's too, he's not super well.
[513:45.23]I've done that before.
[513:46.15]I've eaten a bag of fucking chips before.
[513:47.37]It sucks.
[514:02.48]eating a whole bag of potato chips it's fun for the first 10 minutes and then when it's done you you just you want to bury yourself jeremy if you don't stop I might actually die from lack of sleep
[514:17.15]Alright, I'm going to be the first one to say this here.
[514:20.21]You should go to bed.
[514:22.47]You don't have to stay up.
[514:25.01]We're just going for another hour and a half or so.
[514:26.78]If you want to catch up tomorrow, the vault will be here.
[514:30.90]Please take care of yourself.
[514:32.78]Don't cause yourself any physical pain or any mental anguish to stay up to watch the stream.
[514:38.12]That's my personal advice.
[514:39.24]That's my personal guidance.
[514:41.58]Clean your room.
[514:42.50]My room is perfect.
[514:43.50]It's immaculate.
[514:46.45]Streamer confirms that he has ate chips before.
[514:48.41]I have.
[514:49.73]I have!
[514:52.65]I did!
[514:53.09]I've eaten potato chips before.
[514:57.84]Are you surprised?
[515:02.04]KXE501, thanks for the $5 here.
[515:03.68]Here, this should help.
[515:04.56]I've been reading up on Monster Fusion a bit.
[515:07.60]Seven hours ago.
[515:08.70]And if you want something good to come out of Cura and Tim Allen, you're gonna have to grind for a while to get aliens.
[515:15.45]Allen stats the near the same across the board.
[515:18.17]I think we read this earlier.
[515:19.65]But that was a good tip.
[515:20.81]I actually did read that and I did it and I got it and we're good.
[515:25.69]How many chips in total?
[515:26.61]Probably like at least two.
[515:28.99]Dr. Clay 999, thanks for the $1.
[515:31.85]I saw you had a Tim Allen monster that was basically a fairy creature.
[515:35.57]So that made me make this monstrosity.
[515:39.06]Let's see what it is.
[515:45.96]Well.
[515:46.24]That is Tim Allen as a pixie.
[515:51.58]That is actually Tim Allen.
[515:53.28]I don't know if anybody saw it, but there it is.
[516:02.11]Thank you, Dr. Clay.
[516:03.35]P.S.
[516:03.59]Have you ever played Genome?
[516:05.17]It's an old mech shooting game you might like.
[516:08.27]I've never played it, no.
[516:10.48]Maybe I'll take a look.
[516:13.42]Scan complete.
[516:14.24]Awesome.
[516:14.56]No viruses.
[516:15.28]Thanks.
[516:15.68]Thanks a lot.
[516:16.24]Appreciate it.
[516:16.90]Appreciate the scan you did in the background.
[516:31.43]Thank you, Malwarebytes.
[516:32.79]I was thinking, like, look at this.
[516:38.50]Why is this happening?
[516:39.28]Hold on.
[516:39.62]That's annoying.
[516:42.96]Hold on.
[516:43.38]This is why I couldn't hear it.
[516:48.43]Where are my speakers?
[516:51.85]Oh my god, what a pain in the ass.
[516:53.49]Alright, my speakers don't exist anymore.
[516:57.61]Thanks for the malware.
[517:00.80]Not the guy whose image I just clicked on.
[517:06.69]That was weird.
[517:07.09]If I read this, I'm cursed.
[517:08.29]Cursed.
[517:10.97]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer, for the 25 cents.
[517:14.27]Weird to see all the Rick and Morty references coming out of this series.
[517:16.93]I actually got into voice acting doing Rick and Morty voices.
[517:19.29]I couldn't get a lot of live action roles being an orange cartoon cat.
[517:23.01]But your Bostonian positivity taught this old feline that anything is possible.
[517:26.83]Never stop being you.
[517:27.67]And always remember how much you mean to us.
[517:29.71]Snoopy and I wouldn't be where we are without you.
[517:31.33]Thanks for all the laughs.
[517:33.31]You're welcome, Garfield.
[517:35.81]Thank you, Garfield, for your continued support of the German 985 livestream.
[517:43.50]Alright, that's not good.
[517:45.04]We're gonna back it up here.
[517:50.89]Get some guts.
[517:52.41]And then come in with a 65% free in a row we missed.
[517:57.35]Missing everything.
[518:01.17]Thank god I didn't get hit by the gel cube.
[518:02.48]I mean, come on now.
[518:03.68]What's the story here?
[518:06.15]All it takes is one.
[518:09.13]I would love to have hit that a couple more times.
[518:12.44]Pull it back.
[518:12.96]Oh, my lord.
[518:17.82]Really?
[518:18.08]How are you going to do me like this?
[518:20.78]That's so... This is what you like to see.
[518:24.47]This is what it's called.
[518:27.49]Just... What can I do there?
[518:30.33]Nothing.
[518:39.44]Thank you, RNG gods.
[518:40.50]That was fun.
[518:44.34]Fucking thanks for the voodoo curse.
[518:48.49]President James A. Garfield watches the show.
[518:52.99]Bye-bye, A-rank.
[518:54.07]No, we're not going to lose.
[518:54.87]I'm going to win everything else.
[519:03.48]But thank you, Garfield.
[519:04.34]Appreciate it.
[519:06.20]I think Garfield again comes in here.
[519:08.16]Q&A time with your favorite comedian, Garfield.
[519:09.92]If you had a big budget movie coming out in theaters, what would it be called?
[519:13.72]And what would the plot be?
[519:15.95]How will it change the face of Simina, similar to my blockbuster masterpiece, Tale of Two Kitties, over and out?
[519:21.61]Gotta look through my wallet for more bits.
[519:24.55]That's a loaded question.
[519:25.93]I can't even answer it.
[519:26.71]It would be called Wackadastical.
[519:30.68]Then the movie would open with the ending.
[519:32.68]And the ending would open with the beginning.
[519:34.80]And the beginning is the middle of the movie.
[519:37.26]And then you time travel to the second movie.
[519:39.70]And then the second movie comes out three weeks later.
[519:50.23]No, don't... What's with this late night RNG dog shit?
[519:55.37]Why?
[519:55.83]Yeah, boo me.
[519:56.83]Go on, keep booing me.
[520:01.07]oh my god oh my god I can hit a move I can hit one move
[520:28.17]I'm not going to, for the first time, ever lose to this stupid plant.
[520:31.96]The most useless enemy in the whole game.
[520:37.94]Thank God.
[520:43.32]Do it!
[520:44.55]Yeah, okay, we're solidified.
[520:50.69]Thank you to Xenopika for the $1.
[520:53.09]How did you get the pre-release alpha of Pokemon on Switch?
[520:56.67]Just gotta know somebody.
[520:58.89]I know a guy that knows a guy.
[521:02.54]Sleepy Pigeon, thanks for the $1.
[521:03.90]My birds and I love your stream.
[521:05.20]Say hi to Clyde and Mavi, the pigeons, and Timmy, the cockatiel.
[521:12.35]I love birds.
[521:14.87]I'm sure they're wonderful.
[521:16.21]Thank you, Sleepy Pigeon.
[521:17.05]Thanks for the $1.
[521:19.51]Garfield the Monday Killer is back in action here with $0.50.
[521:24.01]Another question, is there a limit on times we can donate bits during a stream?
[521:27.17]You of all people know I got a problem with oversaturating the market with lasagna punchlines.
[521:32.23]Now for an obligatory make fun of Jerma joke.
[521:36.56]That one just made me, I just got gas from that.
[521:38.86]I just burped.
[521:39.38]That gave me gas.
[521:41.68]Local streamer reads funny Garfield jokes on stream.
[521:44.12]Foreign streamer finds a way to gamble in Monster Rancher to satiate his addiction.
[521:48.02]Streamer from another realm named something Mr. Ice Cream, so on and so forth.
[521:52.41]Thanks a lot, man.
[521:55.02]Back in quaction, back in action?
[521:59.12]Birds are great, I like birds.
[522:01.53]Reaper, 500 thanks for the $1.
[522:04.17]Hey Derma, you said you would share the video of the annoying guy you had to film in LA.
[522:09.51]Is that still going to happen?
[522:10.79]Also, how fast can you drink a bottle of water?
[522:14.01]Well, I didn't say I promised to show the video, I said I was gonna look for it.
[522:18.48]What the hell am I supposed to type into YouTube to find that?
[522:22.42]Crazy guy on YouTube.
[522:24.99]Okay.
[522:26.27]I just gave you 70 years of content to go through.
[522:29.38]That's not gonna happen.
[522:35.76]Alright, let's go.
[522:36.60]Come on, let's go for it.
[522:37.94]This is a rare monster, not fair.
[522:39.66]That sucked.
[522:48.65]It's all about that pierce.
[522:52.73]I don't think I want to be near it.
[522:53.99]Maybe the Stinger?
[522:55.42]What's the least damage I can take here?
[522:57.04]I didn't really check his... stuff or anything.
[523:01.74]That's fine.
[523:03.76]Fine, knock me out of the way back.
[523:05.16]I'll stay back here.
[523:11.98]Stay back.
[523:12.94]Don't do anything dumb.
[523:14.26]Get the guts to come back.
[523:16.94]And pierce.
[523:20.66]Mmm, mwah.
[523:21.26]Two health.
[523:24.62]That should be a good game.
[523:28.08]It's Ina.
[523:35.01]K.O.
[523:38.41]Hey, goodnight, Upward Fern.
[523:39.33]Thank you for sticking around for as long as you did.
[523:41.19]Long stream, long hours.
[523:45.85]Have a great night.
[523:50.08]Thank you to an Atom for the 50 cents.
[523:53.07]Streamer admits to having trouble wiping himself and he shit his robe.
[523:57.19]Thank you Hydra725 for the one doll.
[523:58.79]The robe was white before yesterday.
[524:02.66]Thank you TechnoToast for the 75 cents.
[524:04.40]Local streamer shits in huge robe live on stream.
[524:08.54]That'd be interesting.
[524:10.38]Laser Nukes, thanks for the five bucks.
[524:14.01]Hey, Jerm, I've been thoroughly enjoying the past few streams.
[524:16.35]I laugh to myself about BBS dabbing at work, and it makes me happy.
[524:19.61]Keep doing your thing, man.
[524:20.57]Jerm is Saturn.
[524:22.69]Thank you, LaserNukes.
[524:27.15]Appreciate the $5.
[524:28.01]Thanks.
[524:29.77]Glad you can laugh about this at work.
[524:32.24]But if you ever told your coworkers what you were laughing at, they would probably be like, what the hell are you talking about?
[524:38.42]A tea sizzle.
[524:39.42]Tea sizzle smooth.
[524:40.28]Thanks for the one dollar.
[524:41.08]You ready for more snow?
[524:42.18]Resident sleeper.
[524:43.32]It's gonna be great.
[524:46.64]The reason why we're pretty much doing this stream for ten hours is because I'm... I'm wholeheartedly anticipating that I won't be able to stream in two days.
[524:58.31]Maybe I'll be proven wrong.
[524:59.75]We'll see.
[525:01.48]Alright, just don't get sneezed on.
[525:03.52]And I'll be fine.
[525:07.93]Just give it a whack and then back it up.
[525:10.45]That's not good.
[525:14.79]Again.
[525:15.93]92%.
[525:15.99]What's with the... Oh, he's fooled.
[525:18.03]That's why.
[525:20.80]Just don't get hit by one of those.
[525:21.90]If I get hit by one... Alright.
[525:24.58]Playing smart.
[525:25.78]Back it up.
[525:26.58]Don't get hit by that charge.
[525:28.48]Out of reach.
[525:28.94]Get out of reach.
[525:29.64]Get out of reach.
[525:32.04]Get out of reach!
[525:36.82]There we go.
[525:42.85]And... Honestly, I gotta be careful because all it takes is him to do this one time.
[525:55.97]If I get hit for 100 damage by that stupid charge move, I would cry.
[526:00.09]And do it again just so I can keep the timer going down.
[526:09.40]Run the clock out.
[526:14.79]Time up.
[526:18.93]Jerma's Nuts, thanks for the $1.
[526:20.36]Please put a fan down here.
[526:21.98]We're broiling.
[526:24.68]TechnoToast, thanks for the 25 cents.
[526:26.16]Local streamer can't count to three.
[526:27.40]Sponsored by Valve.
[526:29.80]StixRenegade, thanks for the $1.
[526:32.07]Who needs to count to two when you have the V?
[526:34.71]Wiggles Eyebrows.
[526:37.55]TheNav, thanks for the 25 cents.
[526:38.93]God damn it, Jerma.
[526:39.51]Stop being such a good actor.
[526:40.49]You're making me sad.
[526:44.39]Oh, this is when I was crying.
[526:45.59]Oh, yeah.
[526:46.69]I forgot about that.
[526:47.55]It's been a long... Dude, I've been streaming for, like... A whole day has gone by for me.
[526:52.67]So when I did something, like, six or seven hours ago, I don't even remember that I did it.
[527:00.23]Quadratic is unbeatable.
[527:06.09]Thank you, uh... Soup or Seal for the 25 cents.
[527:09.47]Jerma, please never cry ever again.
[527:10.95]It makes me cry, even if it's a fake Bible thump.
[527:18.33]Sorry, I just had to do it.
[527:22.43]Zmanreal78 with 10 bucks.
[527:24.43]I just want to say the dogs are better than cats.
[527:26.85]We addressed that already.
[527:27.79]I'm a dog person.
[527:28.55]Thank you though.
[527:30.51]Vanderhoff, thanks for the 250.
[527:32.87]Did you cut your own hair?
[527:34.35]No, just hasn't.
[527:35.47]I haven't cut it in about four and a half, five, maybe six months, maybe a year, maybe like six or seven months, probably like eight months.
[527:41.45]How many hours have I streamed?
[527:42.80]About nine now, nine months.
[527:45.36]I'm hair pregnant.
[527:47.18]I gotta focus here, though, because this guy could kill me.
[527:53.86]Gotta get some good rolls on this one.
[527:56.66]Starting off good.
[527:57.96]One more.
[528:00.52]Wow, he crit me.
[528:01.70]Dick.
[528:02.86]Dick!
[528:03.12]I got lucky.
[528:05.42]Told you I had to get lucky.
[528:07.92]Moving up to C already, and he's not even one year old.
[528:10.41]We're moving up.
[528:11.35]I'm gonna get to A.
[528:16.47]How did this guy lose all of his matches?
[528:19.26]I don't understand.
[528:21.36]Like, when you have a move like that, that does that much damage.
[528:23.50]Now I have to kill him.
[528:24.96]He has to die.
[528:28.96]One more.
[528:29.66]Guaranteed hit.
[528:30.18]Come on, I need to get the one right here.
[528:31.30]14.
[528:31.32]Got it.
[528:34.48]Oh, please.
[528:35.70]You... Give me a break.
[528:40.46]Don't you dare.
[528:41.42]Seriously.
[528:43.41]That's un-fucking-believable.
[528:50.63]51 damage.
[528:51.85]Great.
[528:55.13]I lost every fucking match.
[528:56.58]And he's the best character.
[528:59.10]I don't understand.
[529:00.54]He is the best fucking character here.
[529:03.20]Why would he lose any of these matches?
[529:06.81]I still win the tournament.
[529:07.61]It doesn't matter.
[529:09.09]Good luck.
[529:22.39]Yeah, we have monsters that are tied.
[529:23.77]Tiebreaker.
[529:24.77]I'll beat this guy right now.
[529:35.82]Tying with Palmer.
[529:39.04]Just don't get hit by this stupid move.
[529:41.46]I won't be able to get hit.
[529:43.44]Play it smart.
[529:47.51]Aye, that's not smart.
[529:49.43]That's not good.
[529:50.07]At least it doesn't do that much damage.
[529:52.81]Just gotta wear him down.
[529:56.70]Again.
[529:56.92]Fuck you.
[529:58.96]71%.
[529:59.02]Come on.
[530:00.30]Fuck you.
[530:03.92]Keep it back.
[530:04.82]Don't let him do the charge.
[530:07.48]See if I can... No.
[530:09.86]It's alright if I stay within 3 and 4.
[530:10.92]Please.
[530:13.68]Please.
[530:17.31]No, dodge it.
[530:18.65]Oh, god damn it.
[530:27.90]I'm going to come in here and hit him with something.
[530:33.15]There it is.
[530:33.65]Okay.
[530:35.53]One more thing.
[530:36.35]One more hit.
[530:37.33]Bring it in.
[530:37.67]Bring it in.
[530:38.75]Oh, no.
[530:39.43]It's going to come down to this.
[530:42.31]Percentage-wise, I can't tell.
[530:45.02]Oh, I didn't get it.
[530:52.01]Damn it!
[530:52.91]Fuck me.
[530:54.27]That's so irritating.
[530:55.61]God damn it.
[531:05.03]I just got fucked there so bad in two different matches.
[531:07.66]It really did.
[531:13.44]I'm just going right to C. Like, that was just so dumb.
[531:22.28]Kill a guy, he comes back to life, and does a fucking roll crit to me.
[531:27.63]Get the fuck out of here.
[531:29.85]I'm gonna put Last Stand in Monster Rancher 2.
[531:35.00]Eat my ass.
[531:53.67]Is this one of those angry rage streamers?
[531:55.97]No.
[532:00.90]Which food?
[532:01.42]Um... I'm running out of money, let's stay with milk.
[532:05.40]Thank you, Vanderhoff, for the 250.
[532:06.54]That was the guy that said, oh, I cut my own hair.
[532:09.36]No, I don't.
[532:11.20]Raph, mouse, thanks for the $1.
[532:12.32]Are you still gonna make a Patreon?
[532:15.15]It's, yeah, it's in the cards.
[532:16.99]It's just, certain things have to happen.
[532:20.34]There are certain companies and certain establishments that need to get back to us.
[532:25.29]And... Unfortunately... These places require lots of... Lots of slow-moving parts to do them.
[532:36.08]So... We'll see.
[532:39.30]Hopefully soon.
[532:40.32]53 loyalty, that's good for this early.
[532:44.40]Thank you, King Swag, for the $5.04.
[532:47.84]Use this to get a haircut, my dude.
[532:49.58]Kappa 301.
[532:49.88]Thank you.
[532:54.05]For the $5.
[532:54.67]A haircut is $20.
[532:56.03]I'm like, excuse me, haircut.
[532:59.19]I'm like pulling my hand out still.
[533:01.85]Thanks, man.
[533:04.71]This is Shpee.
[533:05.33]Thanks for the $5.35.
[533:05.85]You should make a Shpee monster.
[533:09.87]This guy's got a blue... He's blue and he looks like he's wearing a suit.
[533:13.23]And he's sneaky and scary.
[533:14.23]That's a spy.
[533:15.11]That's Team Fortress 2 spy on the screen.
[533:18.33]Comet, thanks for the 50 cents.
[533:19.89]It seems you have consumed too much paper.
[533:21.62]Please use these bits to go buy some old bubble gum from a machine instead.
[533:25.94]Thank you, dude.
[533:29.86]Let's feed him a... Okay, he's fond.
[533:33.40]No, this is... We can't do this.
[533:36.60]We're gonna give him a mint leaf, and then I'm gonna give him something he's not gonna like.
[533:48.61]I need to give him a... I gotta get him off a fawn.
[533:54.56]Gotta do it.
[533:55.42]We gotta feed him a snake.
[534:01.16]And while I'm here, I'll buy more mint leaves.
[534:10.15]Shave it off on stream?
[534:11.51]No, you know how bad I would look bald?
[534:15.13]Let's go back.
[534:15.73]I want to sell all the other shit I have.
[534:18.50]I would look terrible bald.
[534:19.44]I have such a bumpy, rocky-ass face.
[534:24.06]You'd think I would look good bald.
[534:25.34]Not even close.
[534:27.32]Am I out of... I don't have any more left.
[534:37.10]Alright, so we're going to use the snake.
[534:41.00]I don't want him to be fawned.
[534:41.98]I'm not going to shave my hair off.
[534:54.07]The monster doesn't seem to need any more items.
[534:56.73]Still fawned.
[534:57.41]How are you still fawned?
[535:01.33]Errantry.
[535:02.17]Let's do power again.
[535:07.52]Now, that's speed.
[535:13.19]Power.
[535:18.65]Uh, we'll do a D monster.
[535:19.91]Uh, Heat Eye.
[535:22.63]Who cares?
[535:23.09]Let's do it.
[535:23.73]Hey, Nightfang!
[535:27.33]Thank you for the $1.
[535:28.13]Hey, Jerem, just wanted to let you know that I turned 20 two Sundays ago.
[535:32.17]Also, the other thing that I wanted to tell you is that it's starting to work out more.
[535:36.60]Good.
[535:37.44]Glad to hear.
[535:38.42]Drink more water and eat more healthy foods over these past couple of weeks so I can lose a lot of weight.
[535:43.14]Do you have any tips that you can share?
[535:46.62]Tips for losing weight?
[535:48.44]I really don't have any.
[535:49.76]I've never been trying to lose any weight.
[535:54.91]Mostly my entire life I've been actually trying to gain weight since I was probably 16.
[536:00.19]But healthy living styles seems like you're doing the right thing.
[536:04.76]I would say... just drinking more water is great, eating healthier foods is great.
[536:09.29]You know what else is also good too, is just cut down on sugar as well.
[536:13.69]You wouldn't believe how much extra processed sugar is in every fucking thing we eat.
[536:18.95]We're only supposed to take in 32 grams of extra sugar a day that's processed sugar, just not from fruits and vegetables or whatever.
[536:26.30]One Coca-Cola has like 30-something grams of sugar in it.
[536:30.94]More than the whole damn day.
[536:33.32]Fail.
[536:34.13]Please.
[536:37.83]Take in less sugar.
[536:38.83]Across the board.
[536:43.87]You can still eat sugar.
[536:44.59]You can still take... You can... He's injured.
[536:46.39]God damn it.
[536:52.80]Of course.
[536:53.18]And now he's gonna be stressed out.
[536:54.42]And this is...
[537:04.01]His loyalty is gonna drop down to like 10 again.
[537:06.77]Is there a way you can just prevent injuries?
[537:10.45]Like it just seems like randomly sometimes he's hurt for a month and a half and now he hates me and he's dead and he's at 10 loyalty.
[537:19.37]There's gotta be something I can fucking do to make that not happen, right?
[537:28.37]Stay home.
[537:31.65]Go rest.
[537:35.15]Thank you to E-Strong for the $1.
[537:37.17]Cheer, thank you.
[537:38.85]Haphaxian, thanks for the 50 cents.
[537:40.31]Alright, so this is a hybrid Naga Pixie.
[537:43.37]Best status skill, defense and life are the worst.
[537:46.47]Everything else is decent.
[537:48.20]If you want, I can whisper you a stat guide.
[537:55.42]Uh... Status skill, defense and life.
[537:58.58]Yeah, we didn't put very much... We didn't do very much into defense.
[538:00.58]I'm not going to make that mistake again.
[538:02.62]We're doing defense on this dude.
[538:06.63]to give him one of his favorite things.
[538:08.56]Do I only have one mint leaf left?
[538:19.87]Tara, thank you.
[538:21.19]Tara Lachrin, you've corrected me a million times in your name and my brain is so small I'll never be able to fix it.
[538:27.75]Tara, I don't know why you keep calling me Tara.
[538:31.33]Hey, Jeremiah, have you ever considered playing the Shenmue games?
[538:33.47]They're hilarious, bad, and so somehow amazing all at once.
[538:37.27]Would definitely recommend while you're in this whole PlayStation kick.
[538:42.25]Ah, Shenmue.
[538:43.94]Dreamcast.
[538:45.56]We'll be playing Shenmue for Dreamcast.
[538:48.18]Dreamcast is sitting behind me there.
[538:50.56]You will absolutely see Shenmue.
[538:54.34]Promise.
[538:56.61]Lieutenant Pyrotech, thanks for the $1.
[538:58.19]Good morning, Jeremiah.
[538:58.81]Good morning.
[539:02.21]We tried that and we got this random little shitty guy.
[539:11.44]What was my first console?
[539:14.36]My first console was technically the Atari, but I didn't play it.
[539:16.75]But the NES was the first game I actually played as a child.
[539:21.81]What have we got for the... Here comes the official tournaments here.
[539:24.71]We can win this shit.
[539:25.85]I'm certain of it.
[539:28.57]Um...
[539:31.85]Rest up.
[539:33.35]We're going to the tournament.
[539:34.09]We're beating that guy.
[539:35.41]I know I can do it.
[539:36.31]I'm lucky.
[539:40.47]Thank you to Training Book for the $1.
[539:45.88]Just finished Little Witch Academia.
[539:47.98]Highly recommend it if you have Netflix.
[539:51.40]What's with animes and being called academia?
[539:55.30]Something, something, academia.
[539:56.50]Something, something, academia.
[539:57.67]It seems like there's four shows that have that.
[540:00.07]What's with the academia thing?
[540:04.66]Hydration Blot.
[540:05.50]Thank you.
[540:05.84]I'm hydrating.
[540:11.09]I am.
[540:11.43]I really am.
[540:14.73]No, don't rest.
[540:16.93]Battle.
[540:18.05]D. Do it.
[540:20.52]I really would love to be doing something else right now instead of D. Academia Academy.
[540:31.53]Hey, Edgemont, from earlier, I don't know if you're still here, but thank you for the $50, dude, that's a lot of fucking money.
[540:38.88]You pay me lots of money, lots of times.
[540:44.42]Thank you.
[540:46.58]Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the 25 cents.
[540:49.10]I just ran into Censor Bar and James Garfield on the way back to John's.
[540:52.48]They straight up started bashing me with wrenches.
[540:56.40]Luckily, Hobbs showed up with a shovel and chased him away.
[540:59.26]Stay safe, Germo.
[540:59.98]I heard that the memes are... I have not forgiven you for the meme massacre.
[541:03.90]If you need anything, BaldCoin and I got your back.
[541:05.92]Glad you're feeling better.
[541:12.09]Sorry.
[541:14.05]I made that like... Thanks, dude.
[541:20.92]Thank you to Fred Flintstone.
[541:23.99]For the one dollar.
[541:25.41]I fucking hate, hate you.
[541:26.95]P.S.
[541:27.25]I love you.
[541:29.10]I'm tired, man.
[541:29.94]Come on, give me a break.
[541:32.14]I always wish you could give more.
[541:33.14]Don't even worry about that, dude.
[541:35.48]Edgemont, you've given... You've given such an incredible amount of money to this stream over the last year or so.
[541:42.58]It's... You don't even think that way.
[541:48.53]Alright, let's win them all.
[541:51.03]Get the good rolls.
[541:53.49]Pull it back just a little bit here.
[541:54.73]Going for the, going for the kill.
[541:59.09]There it is.
[542:00.15]Good.
[542:01.19]Not gonna lose this shit again.
[542:08.26]Thank you Raf Hype for the $5.
[542:09.28]They just say cheer, thank you.
[542:12.88]Reaper 500, thanks for the $1.
[542:14.20]Also, according to IMDB, you played Glue Man.
[542:16.64]We talked about that already.
[542:17.84]Thanks, Stu.
[542:20.83]Uh, Samuel Sish, thanks for the $1.
[542:22.55]Glad you got your real name off your chest.
[542:24.51]Truth is, my name isn't even Samuel Sish.
[542:26.96]Shocking, I know, it's Chase.
[542:28.48]And that's a more of a... What's wrong with Elbertson?
[542:35.98]What's wrong with Chase?
[542:40.89]What's wrong with Chase?
[542:41.59]Chase is not a bad name.
[542:42.63]What's wrong with Chase?
[542:45.49]It's always fun supporting streamers.
[542:48.98]I just hope you're enjoying the stream.
[542:50.86]I do.
[542:52.47]If you are, then... Good.
[542:55.07]I'm incredibly fucking happy about that.
[542:59.49]Old man name streamer.
[543:03.48]Well, thank you KXE501 for the 250, even though they're not here.
[543:06.94]I'm still gonna read them.
[543:10.12]Who do you voodoo, Jeremy?
[543:16.34]Um, I don't know.
[543:20.96]Thank you, uh, Savypeer, Savypeer, for the five dollars.
[543:24.44]PJ Salt, some salt for your bath.
[543:28.38]Thank you.
[543:30.79]Oh, I forgot the end.
[543:31.95]I'm sorry.
[543:36.59]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[543:38.27]Slow down, Palmer.
[543:39.87]Take a fucking chill pill.
[543:42.37]Got plenty of those in my trunk.
[543:47.01]I got lots of tablets in my trunk if you want to take some.
[543:50.97]Don't take too many, though.
[543:53.38]You'll end up seeing Popeye the sailor man.
[543:57.70]And Napoleon conquering Europe.
[544:02.88]Come on, you get... Don't do this to me, Palmer.
[544:11.55]Just getting booed.
[544:14.79]Just getting...
[544:15.58]Food, it sucks.
[544:21.82]None of this foolery.
[544:23.28]What is... Is my monster as tired as I am right now?
[544:27.37]Is that the problem here?
[544:32.57]Apparently.
[544:33.83]But we still win.
[544:34.63]Yeah, the tablets, the food, and the monster rancher.
[544:42.21]That's what I'm talking about.
[544:46.07]Thank you, Techno Toast, for the 75 cents.
[544:47.67]You have to return the slab, Jeremy, or else you'll suffer that guy's curse.
[544:52.50]We got no slabs.
[544:54.38]It's Wolfie, thanks for the $1.
[544:55.58]The Milk Master, thanks for the $1.
[544:58.12]Yeah, okay, but when is the Garfield cart stream?
[545:00.39]In my honest opinion, April 1st would be a good day.
[545:02.53]No, I'm reading a book on April 1st.
[545:08.04]I told you, I'm going to get one of those, like, 100-page, stupid, like, 80-page adventure books.
[545:17.28]From, like, some shitty author that nobody cares about.
[545:19.02]I'm gonna read the whole thing.
[545:21.79]Oh, whoops.
[545:22.75]April Fool's.
[545:25.51]Uh, thank you to... Thank you to, uh, MeDoubleJ.
[545:32.13]Thanks for the $1.04.
[545:32.51]Hey, I'm a long-time fan and birthday boy.
[545:35.05]Keep up the great content.
[545:35.93]Happy birthday, MeDoubleJ.
[545:38.29]Hope you had a good one.
[545:40.45]Great April Fools joke.
[545:41.81]I didn't say it was good.
[545:43.70]I just said it's what I'm doing.
[545:48.60]Guys, it was either that, or I was gonna set up a webcam pointing down at my family eating dinner, and we were never gonna acknowledge the camera.
[545:57.28]We were just gonna have dinner, like a turkey dinner, and just talk and do nothing, and it was gonna be like, family eating dinner was gonna be the title of the stream.
[546:06.25]Not one time was I gonna address the chat, or anybody here.
[546:14.41]That's it.
[546:17.23]That's better?
[546:22.54]Well, I got a couple other ideas.
[546:24.28]Maybe I'll do it.
[546:33.25]Uh, but thank you, though.
[546:34.23]Happy birthday, dude.
[546:34.87]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[546:36.91]Hold on.
[546:37.09]Gotta give it a little thwacker.
[546:37.85]A little thwack!
[546:52.41]A little piercer, a little stabber, a little whacker.
[546:55.41]84%, let me get it.
[547:01.13]Stab this little raccoon in his raccoon eyes.
[547:10.15]Do that on Thursday.
[547:11.27]No, what do you mean Thursday?
[547:15.61]Don't... Why do you all have this?
[547:18.38]Is there a reason why you all have this?
[547:24.51]lose this I swear to god no stab him in his face and put an end to this thank you jesus uh thank you dubski dude for the one dollar I will never forgive you for naming this guy quadratic bbs instead of anaconda and we're not gonna put dab in anybody's name no
[547:53.75]Thank you, ZenoPika, for the $1.
[547:55.17]Your monster looks like a mix between the Garg and the Ice Theosaur from Half-Life.
[548:01.10]I just butchered that, but thank you, dude.
[548:04.66]MooMeansMoo, thanks for the $1.
[548:06.54]Please go to wind down bit time soon.
[548:08.80]We're gonna have a ton to read over.
[548:11.00]We're dying here.
[548:12.80]I'm doing it right now.
[548:14.81]We're almost done.
[548:16.69]We're almost done.
[548:21.00]Savior of the Dreaming Dead, thanks for the 25 cents, do you like post-rock German?
[548:26.56]I'm not entirely sure what that means.
[548:28.86]Post-rock.
[548:33.51]I like rock music.
[548:35.81]I think it's good.
[548:37.67]I don't know what post-rock essentially means, but maybe I probably would, maybe.
[548:41.31]I don't know.
[548:43.97]Thank you, though.
[548:47.88]Post-rock, like, rock about the postal service?
[548:53.00]Post-rock, like... I don't know who any of these bands are.
[548:58.71]Jeremiah was hoping to survive to the end of the stream, but I fear not.
[549:01.17]Love you, man.
[549:01.57]Been a blast.
[549:02.19]Take care.
[549:02.61]Don't feel like you're obligated to stay up late.
[549:05.01]Get some sleep.
[549:06.27]I'm not going to be streaming for that.
[549:07.31]I don't know if we're going to be able to get to A rank tonight.
[549:10.91]We might have to postpone this.
[549:12.33]Or just say sorry.
[549:13.59]No, I take that back.
[549:19.57]We'll see what happens.
[549:20.37]I'm gonna try.
[549:26.19]Uh, but thank you.
[549:28.58]To, uh, Mashi... Machete Mario for the $1.
[549:31.88]Nice 24-hour stream you have here.
[549:33.28]No, it'll be more like 10.
[549:36.80]Moo means moo.
[549:37.24]Thanks for the $1.
[549:37.92]First he shits on his bathrobe, then he shits in his donators.
[549:41.08]Nice going, Jeremy.
[549:41.92]Just kidding.
[549:42.34]Love you.
[549:43.70]Thank you, C Splash, for the 50 cents.
[549:45.04]Have you seen the news about Luigi's penis?
[549:48.55]If not, just Google the word Luigi.
[549:53.50]What?
[549:55.02]What does that even mean?
[549:56.22]Luigi?
[549:56.70]If I Google Luigi, I'm going to get Luigi from Mario.
[550:01.56]Thank you, WildHabadi, for the 25 cents.
[550:03.22]Hey, Jeremy, what do you think of the movie The Iron Giant?
[550:05.24]Fantastic animated film.
[550:06.86]One of the greatest we've ever had.
[550:08.53]Absolutely.
[550:09.69]Chaos84, thanks for the 85 cents.
[550:11.17]One day I'm going to donate $100 in ad bits.
[550:15.15]If you might...
[550:17.39]I can't stop you, but... I can't encourage, but I can't stop you either.
[550:23.30]I appreciate the fact that you would farm ad bits for me.
[550:26.32]Thank you.
[550:30.78]What are you talking about?
[550:33.02]Google Luigi.
[550:41.27]Fans of Nintendo's Luigi go nuts over picture that appears to prove he has a penis.
[551:09.10]Uh, why?
[551:10.61]Why are we even talking about this?
[551:14.93]Why would somebody make an article about this?
[551:16.73]Who cares?
[551:20.29]Are we really that starved for fucking content on the internet these days?
[551:24.59]That we have to talk about Luigi's penis and shorts?
[551:28.41]Come on, man.
[551:34.30]How far have we fallen?
[551:37.44]He's in tennis shorts and like his dick's running down his leg.
[551:41.88]Is it though?
[551:42.52]Are you sure?
[551:43.10]Do we have anything else better to talk about besides that?
[551:47.04]I'm sure we do.
[551:48.04]I'm positive we do.
[551:50.28]They calculated the size of the damn thing.
[551:54.71]Why are we doing this?
[552:05.23]You're the furry, dude.
[552:06.69]I'm not a furry!
[552:08.43]Why did I just even say those words?
[552:09.95]No, it's too late to have these kind of conversations.
[552:12.49]By the way, RNG is totally fucking me.
[552:16.94]I have to get a hit right now.
[552:17.94]It's gotta be a crit.
[552:21.76]Oh my god, I couldn't do anything!
[552:25.75]Oh, this stupid fucking Luigi's dick.
[552:29.43]I'm closing the window now.
[552:31.69]Too much of a distraction.
[552:32.81]I don't care about his tennis cock, okay?
[552:37.15]We're getting the fuck away from that.
[552:42.12]What the fuck?
[552:51.40]Time to close the stream.
[552:57.71]I was disturbed.
[552:58.55]I still win.
[553:08.41]Anyways, moving on on these bits here, almost at the end of the bits.
[553:13.64]Thank you to Tim Sunshine for the 25 cents.
[553:16.74]When's the speedrun?
[553:21.44]I want to see somebody speedrun this game.
[553:24.63]If you guys know anybody, any runners that have PlayStations and play PlayStation games, maybe float it to them.
[553:31.17]This would probably itch a few of their brains.
[553:34.85]Because you have to imagine, imagine seeing a speed runner open up and use a CD and shit like, oh shit, I gotta get my Ocarina of Time disc in there to get the rare monster.
[553:44.10]I would love to see something like that.
[553:49.64]All the incredibly detailed things that you have to do would be interesting.
[553:54.41]Hey, TheBallTheKoala, thanks for the 69 cents.
[553:56.28]If Garfield ate lasagna on a Monday, would it be a good day or a bad day?
[553:59.94]It would be a good day.
[554:00.64]It's always a good day when you get lasagna.
[554:05.22]Always a good day.
[554:07.44]MooMeansMoo, thanks for the $1.
[554:08.70]I love that part in Shrek where you screamed.
[554:10.34]Your acting career is illustrious.
[554:11.84]Thank you.
[554:13.72]We're not gonna praise him.
[554:14.40]We're looking soft.
[554:18.04]Hey, Sabertooth.
[554:20.22]That's definitely not your name.
[554:21.25]It's S-B-R-2-T-H.
[554:22.65]I'm gonna say Sabertooth.
[554:23.47]Thanks for the two bucks.
[554:25.27]Love your streams, Jerma.
[554:26.05]I've been watching you for a long time.
[554:27.09]You always make me laugh until I cried.
[554:29.13]Thanks for indirectly getting me through tough times.
[554:32.25]Just happy I can finally support you after all these years.
[554:34.17]Cheers, man.
[554:35.58]Cheers to you, man.
[554:36.46]Thank you.
[554:40.58]It was an Ocarina of Time GameCube disc.
[554:42.34]Don't think I know that.
[554:43.06]Don't think I have this information up here.
[554:48.32]Cheers to that, man.
[554:51.45]Fred Flintstone, thanks for the $1.
[554:52.85]I might as well ride the LARPing train with this name and all.
[554:55.53]Thanks, Jeremy.
[554:56.05]Everyone in Bedrock is a huge fan.
[554:58.25]We even have bets on who wins the Rumble.
[555:00.09]I lost $2,000 last Rumble.
[555:01.84]By the way, Pebbles loves the rats.
[555:03.84]Hey, thanks, man.
[555:05.32]Thank you, Fred Flintstone.
[555:10.20]Appreciate that.
[555:12.64]Let's make it so he's not stressed out.
[555:24.43]BB would have dabbed for that milk.
[555:27.55]Save it.
[555:31.79]Uh, thank you to Fitti, or Fitti, for the 1000 bits.
[555:37.27]Thanks for the 10 bucks, dude.
[555:39.25]Thank you.
[555:40.25]It says, damn, German, this stream has been so long already that it just turned EU friendly.
[555:44.40]It's 8am here in Germany.
[555:45.90]What the hell, dude?
[555:48.22]I said I was, I've never done a 10 hour stream before and we're doing it.
[555:51.80]So we're getting close.
[555:55.03]Thank you for the 10 bucks.
[555:55.91]Appreciate it, man.
[555:57.71]Ze Shpee, thanks for the $1.
[555:59.31]Whatever happened to Grandpa?
[556:00.77]He died in German Rumble Live.
[556:02.24]He's gone.
[556:03.54]He went to hell.
[556:04.22]He went back where he fucking belongs.
[556:09.48]Thank you to Benny Jets for the 25 cents.
[556:11.28]Test.
[556:12.12]It worked.
[556:14.21]Home Slice Hobbs, thanks for the $1.
[556:16.67]That face when you have a cartoon character in your name so it feels like you're just bandwagoning on this meme.
[556:26.84]bandwagoning on the meme all right we got not doing this yet we're gonna do some training oh we got for I want to do errantry again I'm gonna do power I need that move that move is so important power again go who cares about the monster we can just do uh glutton butter monster it's fine

[557:02.97]Thanks, Benny.
[557:04.75]Benny says, here's my monthly salary.
[557:06.53]The kids complain about food, but I know you need it more than we do.
[557:10.41]Dear God.
[557:11.73]Thank you, Benny.
[557:12.43]I appreciate that.
[557:13.39]I feel like your kids would appreciate it more than I would.
[557:18.23]Please refrain from giving me any more of that cash paper money.
[557:22.34]Thank you, Benny Jets.
[557:26.30]Appreciate it.
[557:27.62]Thank you to Sawdust Monies for the 25 cents.
[557:29.40]They just say cheer.
[557:30.08]Thank you.
[557:30.64]Zmanreal78 for the five bucks.
[557:32.66]Go to bed.
[557:33.24]You gotta get to work on Germacraft or you can do a spore stream.
[557:36.07]Either one would be good.
[557:39.09]Thank you, dude.
[557:42.15]Thank you for the five dollars.
[557:44.51]Samuel Cish thanks for the 15 bucks.
[557:46.57]You're implying that there's something more than Luigi's Louie Wee.
[557:51.67]Pass it.
[557:52.49]Fuck.
[557:58.77]In the new terms of service, you're required to have a facecam while streaming.
[558:01.69]Better turn it on.
[558:02.31]Uh, whatever.
[558:08.85]Moo means moo, thanks for the one dollar.
[558:10.11]Uh, I am... dot dot dot, a furry, dot dot dot, fucking Luigi's, dot dot dot, tennis cock.
[558:21.75]German 95 after streaming for nine hours.
[558:23.69]I didn't say those in succession, I didn't say those at the same time.
[558:28.88]Those are split up at least an hour apart.
[558:31.46]At least 30 minutes apart.
[558:35.11]Don't get him stressed out here.
[558:45.73]Is this the definition?
[558:46.49]This is the definition of addiction?
[558:50.12]Nah, we're wrapping it up here soon.
[558:51.12]Don't worry.
[558:53.46]I'm losing loyalty, though.
[558:54.46]Even though he's down to even.
[558:56.30]Go to bed.
[558:59.30]Thank you, Parsnips, for the $1.
[559:00.66]Whose dick is more fearful, Luigi's or Garfield's?
[559:04.46]I'm not going to answer that.
[559:05.40]C. Splash, thanks for the 25 cents.
[559:06.68]I can confirm as someone who plays a lot of Pokemon that RNG gets worse after 2 AM.
[559:11.16]Sorry about the Luigi dick.
[559:13.51]Something about it, man.
[559:14.43]The computer knows.
[559:15.45]The PlayStation 1 understands.
[559:16.89]It knows.
[559:21.47]I got a B. I still need to do C. Save it.
[559:28.49]Thank you to Synthesize.
[559:31.07]Synth is PandaBot for the five bucks.
[559:34.42]Been watching since the awful MS Paint intro.
[559:37.04]Shout out to my boy, Trance Emerson.
[559:41.22]Who the hell is Trance Emerson?
[559:45.10]Checking memory card slot.
[559:46.08]What do I have to do?
[559:50.98]I'm getting blinky now.
[559:52.38]I'm getting blinky now.
[559:53.86]I just realized that.
[559:57.27]I turned over here, I started halfway to read this person's donation, and then I came over here and saved it, and I forgot where I was.
[560:05.55]You don't know Trance Emerson.
[560:06.85]I don't.
[560:07.51]I'm a fucking old man.
[560:08.39]Hey, thank you to the Shish Bee for the $1.
[560:14.11]I would enjoy seeing a GTA 5 stream with mods like the good old days.
[560:18.92]Maybe at some point.
[560:22.84]Oh, this is drill.
[560:24.66]Drill skill.
[560:26.39]Everything's starting to blend together.
[560:30.07]No, I'm not like sleep-tired.
[560:31.33]I'm just kind of mentally tired.
[560:34.37]My body's still completely awake.
[560:38.35]Success.
[560:39.83]Plus 10, holy shit.
[560:41.01]I gotta do an Emerson here.
[560:43.71]An Enema.
[560:45.73]An Entry.
[560:47.27]What the fuck is this thing called?
[560:48.45]An Entry?
[560:51.41]Entrenin?
[560:53.77]Atreyu.
[560:55.18]Well, that's from the Neverending Story.
[560:56.44]What is it called?
[560:58.69]The thing where you do the work and you make the money and you... The thing where you do the work and you make the money and you become the monster and you get the fucking skills.
[561:07.10]Errantry.
[561:07.50]There it is.
[561:12.12]Thank you to ACDC Freak for the five bucks.
[561:15.48]German, please don't cut your hair, because I made a bet with my friend, if you ever cut your hair, I'll have to watch the entire first season of The Nut Shack.
[561:22.38]Also, are you ever going to use your emote slots?
[561:24.67]Yeah, we're going to do 12 Pickle Rick's.
[561:27.37]Thank you for the $5, dude.
[561:28.29]Appreciate it.
[561:29.79]Frogwall, thanks for the $1.
[561:31.15]Next monster named Luigi's Special Salami.
[561:33.88]Maybe if he's green and has a mustache.
[561:38.02]And to wrap it up here, Cthulhu9172, thanks for the 25 cents.
[561:41.22]Been watching you since 2013 or so.
[561:43.22]Your video streams have helped me through some really hard times in my life.
[561:46.42]So thanks for all the help.
[561:47.26]Keep up the good work.
[561:49.51]Thank you so much, Cthulhu, for sticking around and watching for the many years you've been here.
[561:57.51]Much love to you.
[561:58.75]Take care of yourself.
[562:00.35]Much respect.
[562:03.67]More emotes?
[562:04.19]Yeah, 12 Pickle Ricks.
[562:08.11]What time is it right now?
[562:10.94]Almost there.
[562:12.10]9.22.
[562:12.14]Almost at 10 hours exactly.
[562:16.84]This is the one we're going to do next.
[562:18.20]Maybe I should do an Errant Tree.
[562:19.56]I wonder if it's stats.
[562:23.47]Intelligence is so terrible.
[562:24.69]I'm going to do another Power Errant Tree.
[562:28.23]I don't care if it hurts him.
[562:29.93]We need to get to B. It's going to bring his light in...
[562:39.12]I'm just going to keep doing skill here.
[562:51.44]I can get... He has the power.
[562:54.04]I can just keep doing this.
[562:59.75]How am I going to wrap up this epic series with Monster Rancher 3?
[563:04.09]Probably in a few weeks.
[563:05.99]In a couple weeks.
[563:06.71]Maybe not a few weeks.
[563:07.41]I'd like to keep it relevant.
[563:10.42]You know, we're still fresh on.
[563:12.86]Everyone's still having a good time watching it.
[563:14.45]At least most people are.
[563:16.91]Maybe like in a couple weeks.
[563:25.36]Official tournament.
[563:26.26]See if we can get him there.
[563:27.36]Seems tired.
[563:31.26]Mint leaf it up.
[563:39.28]Was Monster Retro 4 on the PlayStation 2?
[563:42.42]What was it on?
[563:42.92]What platform?
[563:49.01]I don't think I'm going to be ready for C. As much as I want to be.
[563:58.69]Let's just do more skill.
[564:02.69]So we can land these moves.
[564:03.85]PS2?
[564:04.29]It is, okay.
[564:05.99]So which one is best?
[564:07.07]Is Monster Retro 3...
[564:09.97]The Monster Rancher 1 of Monster Rancher 2?
[564:13.72]Let me explain.
[564:14.64]So when I played Monster Rancher 1, everybody told me halfway through those streams, just play 2, it's just a better version of 1 with more stuff in it and more monsters and more stuff to do.
[564:26.45]So is Monster Rancher 4 just a better version of Monster Rancher 3?
[564:39.43]Three is better than four.
[564:40.99]I think four is better.
[564:43.09]It looks like people like four better than three.
[564:47.97]Four is bad.
[564:48.77]Four is better than three.
[564:49.85]Okay, so pretty much it seems like preference.
[564:55.74]Who the fuck cares?
[564:57.42]Do the whole series?
[564:58.30]I mean, we could.
[564:58.86]It's like one number higher.
[565:03.00]That's not a big deal, then.
[565:09.59]I don't know.
[565:10.01]The amazing world of Gumball.
[565:34.25]Because life would just be a lot of interesting people in that world.
[565:38.85]They could have a lot of fun.
[565:41.03]Maybe.
[565:42.03]Thank you, Garfield.
[565:43.09]Rudy, thanks for the 25 cents.
[565:44.17]Excited for Monster Hunter 3.
[565:46.03]Monster Rancher 3.
[565:46.89]Thank you, dude.
[565:51.31]I'm going to rest up and see if I can win.
[565:52.87]Let's just try to get lucky.
[566:03.15]He's very well...
[566:05.33]Let's see if we can get lucky here and get up to B immediately.
[566:17.91]Three makes a lot of silly changes I didn't like.
[566:19.92]Four changes a lot too, but I found them to be pleasant.
[566:23.42]Okay, interesting.
[566:25.90]Interesting way to look at it.
[566:26.98]I can see that.
[566:31.56]It's been three months since the last official tournament.
[566:41.36]Seaboys, that's right.
[566:43.14]See if we can move on.
[566:44.26]Alright, well that's... What is that thing?
[566:48.93]Offree?
[566:52.77]I got a feeling I'm gonna get my ass kicked here.
[567:02.63]No, maybe not.
[567:04.57]I mean, I'm underleveled for sure, but...
[567:08.09]There's still a possibility I could land a couple of good blows.
[567:11.69]We don't have the drill, which is going to be a huge, huge problem.
[567:16.84]Thank God that she missed it.
[567:23.54]I've got to get lucky for this to work, and that hasn't happened yet.
[567:29.07]Got you.
[567:34.59]There we go.
[567:35.99]That's what I'm talking about.
[567:36.75]One more time, another Pierce.
[567:38.21]Shit.
[567:41.71]What's my opinion on Undertale?
[567:44.63]Uh, I... I've played it a few times.
[567:49.48]I streamed to Undertale, start to finish.
[567:52.86]That was one of my first streams I think I ever did, when I had like a real schedule, was to play Undertale.
[568:01.32]I don't want to get in a position where he can hit me with this.
[568:05.44]Do you need to hit one of these, though?
[568:06.78]It needs to get... No!
[568:10.12]I'm not ready for this tournament.
[568:11.28]I gotta get a big crit right now.
[568:13.18]No.
[568:14.40]He's not ready.
[568:15.04]He needed, like, another few... He needed another couple months to work out.
[568:19.78]It's not gonna happen.
[568:29.97]I'm starting to see colors.
[568:36.25]I can't watch those streams because your voices don't match my headcanon.
[568:41.17]I could understand that.
[568:42.75]I could see that.
[568:53.52]I want to see what Offrey is.
[568:54.60]He looks weird.
[569:05.14]Are those streams still out there?
[569:06.50]Um... I think they might be archived somewhere.
[569:11.61]There's at least one full stream from Undertale that's somewhere on the internet.
[569:18.85]Yeah, this is not... I needed to get another 10 to 20 points in pretty much every other stat to be able to compete here.
[569:30.34]It's too bad we weren't in this position at the beginning of the stream.
[569:33.38]With this guy, you know, have like two... Because this is the first time we ever had like two fully leveled up monsters.
[569:39.17]And by fully, I mean, you know, obviously, you know, more than C or into B. It's just too bad that the first time we have that is now.
[569:49.14]Because this guy is going to be deadly in like another six hours.
[570:00.05]No, he just crushed me.
[570:05.11]Yeah, I'm not even doing the right technique here, but... I think this whole tournament would be a wash.
[570:12.13]They're on YouTube?
[570:13.59]That's good.
[570:17.07]Yeah, he just wasn't ready.
[570:19.56]He took him in too early.
[570:26.24]I could bring this guy to Monster Rancher 3.
[570:29.20]I actually could, you know what, I might be able to off-stream.
[570:32.48]Just play a little bit more and get to the higher rank and unlock a rare monster and just surprise you guys in Monster Hunter 3 with all the league shit.
[570:38.85]Look at this cool monster I got.
[570:44.29]Thank you.
[570:44.65]Moo means moo for the $1.
[570:46.07]You and the Pope share something in common.
[570:47.89]A love of Undertale.
[570:51.92]What is that fucking thing?
[570:55.06]I want to see that guy.
[570:57.89]I want that guy.
[570:59.15]Can I steal a monster in this game?
[571:03.93]Thank you Samuel Sish for the one dollar.
[571:05.51]Here's my mock-up of a pickle germ emote.
[571:15.67]What the fuck is that?
[571:16.93]Oh my god.
[571:19.05]Alright, hold on a second.
[571:26.54]I'm gonna put this on stream right now.
[571:42.84]This just reminds me of the old, uh, what was the commercial with the cereal with the weird characters in it?
[571:58.30]You want that to be an emote?
[572:00.43]Does it even work as an emote, though?
[572:01.91]You can't even tell what it is.
[572:08.29]It's just a pickle.
[572:11.46]It's like this big.
[572:16.24]I like it, though.
[572:19.56]Alright, let's see this weird monster that we haven't seen before.
[572:26.32]Oops, I just turned off the actual... There we go.
[572:32.52]It's Pickled Germ... Zamber!
[572:34.28]This is new.
[572:35.82]He's gonna Fireball.
[572:38.84]How did I dodge that?
[572:39.58]There we go.
[572:46.13]Throw an Energy Ball at him.
[572:48.67]Yikes.
[572:54.95]Yikes.
[573:01.18]I'm gonna pull this back.
[573:02.86]Shoot the fireball at me.
[573:03.70]58%.
[573:03.72]Good.
[573:03.96]Am I getting into a planet?
[573:08.84]A streaming in orbit planet.
[573:13.77]A pickle is not a planet.
[573:19.45]Yeah, after this tournament, we're gonna have to call it a night here.
[573:24.56]I'll do the sub-credits and then we're gonna be out of here.
[573:28.60]And then you'll see me again on Thursday.
[573:32.13]It is almost 4 o'clock in the morning.
[573:33.72]I have just shit... I have just diarrhea'd all over my sleep schedule from this stream.
[573:44.98]In fact, I think I'm going to pull him out.
[573:46.66]After we see Offrey, I'm going to pull him out.
[573:51.62]Hey, Zamanreal78, thanks for the 25 cents.
[573:53.68]What's your favorite game of all time?
[573:55.42]That's a tough one.
[573:58.69]Uh...
[574:00.93]Of all time.
[574:04.77]I have a list of five.
[574:08.69]Maybe ten.
[574:11.30]I mean, the Chrono Trigger's up there.
[574:14.06]Mario RPG is up there.
[574:17.26]Bloodborne is up there.
[574:22.48]What else is up there?
[574:27.62]TF2 is up there.
[574:29.78]Diablo 2 is up there.
[574:30.96]The Neverhood is up there.
[574:37.96]Garfield's Cart is up there.
[574:39.22]What about Minecraft?
[574:49.60]No, Minecraft.
[574:58.21]Sorcery, actually, sorcery probably is up there.
[575:00.91]That is one of my favorite experiences ever.
[575:03.51]Except that game falls off the best games ever list for me.
[575:09.14]Because there's a lot of really, really specific, incredibly difficult things to do in that game that you would just never know what the fuck to do.
[575:17.40]Unless you did like a picture-perfect step-by-step guide to do it.
[575:23.74]But it's still great.
[575:25.28]And we're gonna actually beat this worthless piece of fucking puddle.
[575:29.54]I got one victory.
[575:31.44]And it was against the water guy.
[575:33.90]That was skinned Sonic.
[575:39.96]And they put a bunch of water on his head.
[575:45.86]Jixios, thanks for the 25 cents.
[575:47.42]Don't talk and chat often, but wanted to say that your streams are great to listen to while working on projects.
[575:52.38]Thanks, man.
[575:54.86]Appreciate that.
[575:59.77]FigNewtonsBalls thanks for the one dollar.
[576:01.79]I came to your last stream when it first started and had to leave because my sister went into labor.
[576:07.01]Damn.
[576:07.43]Met the baby then came back to catch the end of the stream.
[576:10.17]I became an aunt to your stream.
[576:13.91]Well there you go.
[576:16.25]Congratulations.
[576:20.31]Your sister went into labor.
[576:21.65]I gotta come back and watch this guy breed monsters.
[576:26.41]No.
[576:27.29]That's awesome.
[576:30.90]Hope the baby's doing well.
[576:32.78]Hope your sister's doing well.
[576:38.18]We need to see this little weirdo before I turn the stream off.
[576:44.34]Zmanreal78, what's up again?
[576:46.38]What about Spore?
[576:48.96]Spore's a great game when it came out.
[576:53.89]It was fun enough.
[576:54.71]The creature creator was interesting.
[576:56.21]It was different.
[576:56.73]Still might be able to make some money here if I win.
[577:12.33]Not really.
[577:14.27]Well, the video game Spore was kind of stupid.
[577:17.71]But the creature creator of Spore was fun.
[577:23.74]Why does this guy have this much health?
[577:26.40]I remember him being terrible.
[577:27.50]Is there a reason why you're like... When did you get this move?
[577:38.83]Move...
[577:53.78]There's a yawn.
[577:54.54]There's the first big major yawn.
[577:57.84]There it is.
[577:58.30]Good slow motion there.
[578:01.28]I like it.
[578:02.54]I still might win this one.
[578:07.03]No, no, no, no.
[578:08.13]Go for it.
[578:08.65]Go for it.
[578:08.97]Come on.
[578:11.29]Percentage-wise, I think I might still win.
[578:15.39]I have a chance.
[578:16.17]I think so, yeah.
[578:16.99]Yeah, I got it.
[578:27.71]How are you still alive?
[578:29.33]Doing my first ever 10-hour stream.
[578:32.76]Don't pa- Oh, I'm fine.
[578:33.46]Don't worry.
[578:35.06]I'm not gonna pass out or anything.
[578:36.56]I'm good to go.
[578:38.94]I say that and all of a sudden I'm just like... In the back of my chair, sleeping.
[578:47.45]Yeah, we're going to bed after this.
[578:49.47]I just want to see this little weirdo.
[578:59.08]Where is he?
[579:05.68]Well, here's the Suspain.
[579:08.83]I still have kind of a chance.
[579:10.67]It's possible.
[579:11.55]If I don't lose again, I might be able to win.
[579:20.46]It's possible.
[579:21.06]Just play it smart, maybe.
[579:28.21]Turn the webcam on and show us the weirdo.
[579:31.89]I don't think he wants to see me right now.
[579:33.25]I'm... tired.
[579:34.47]You know when somebody's really tired?
[579:37.11]And when you feel really tired and you know you just look tired and you know you just look... really schlumpy.
[579:42.51]You know what I mean?
[579:43.41]I feel schlumpy.
[579:46.43]I definitely look schlumpy too and I don't really... You know, no webcam right now.
[579:52.16]By the way, um... Underleveled and understat did.
[579:55.40]I'm about to beat this guy first fucking try.
[580:02.90]Like, I'm about to beat the dude that's been giving me so much trouble every time.
[580:06.08]He's about to lose to a guy that shouldn't even be in this competition.
[580:17.59]Push him away.
[580:17.97]See if we can get a last hit here.
[580:24.38]That... I... I still won.
[580:28.06]I'm good.
[580:31.57]I'm good!
[580:38.78]3 and 3!
[580:38.90]This is still possible to win!
[580:42.21]Depends on what this little weirdo is.
[580:44.75]Yeah, I did almost throw that.
[580:54.42]Big time.
[580:57.36]Alright.
[580:58.04]The time has almost come.
[580:59.10]Hey, thank you Lethal Spoon for the 25 cents.
[581:03.41]Don't know if you ever have been asked...
[581:05.38]But did I miss the bits that went unread from the stream two days ago?
[581:09.39]You did not miss them.
[581:10.19]They actually don't exist anymore.
[581:13.49]When my computer bluescreened, I lost the most recent actions, and I can't really go anywhere to find them.
[581:22.21]So unfortunately, I'm sorry, the ones from the bluescreen I can't really read.
[581:27.23]But I thank everybody that even considered giving any money.
[581:32.92]Thank you so much to everybody.
[581:35.08]Sorry that happened.
[581:38.44]But see, Splash, thanks for the 25 cents here.
[581:40.36]If you had to bang one of the monsters in Monster... No, I'm tired and I just read it.
[581:47.95]Look at this little magician guy.
[581:49.19]I didn't even see his stats.
[581:50.85]Get in close.
[581:55.23]Wow, I'm gonna beat him in one second.
[581:58.21]Oh my god, I'm gonna win.
[581:59.03]I'm gonna beat that.
[581:59.59]I'm gonna win the tournament.
[582:00.51]That guy sucks.
[582:08.84]I'm gonna win this tournament if I win another match.
[582:14.22]Four and three?
[582:15.60]He's four and two?
[582:20.51]I might win the tournament.
[582:21.59]I have a chance.
[582:22.97]Do I if I win one more?
[582:23.93]He has to lose.
[582:26.62]Oh, beautiful.
[582:28.98]Absolutely fucking beautiful.
[582:30.82]Yeah, I didn't lose yet.
[582:42.57]All right, now Nicole has to lose.
[582:44.65]No, it doesn't matter, actually.
[582:47.14]Either one of these needs to lose.
[582:49.98]No, well, Nicole ain't gonna lose.
[582:51.18]All right, Nicole wins.
[582:54.26]No?
[582:54.66]Oh, well.
[582:56.78]Monsters that are tied.
[582:59.34]All right, so now this is... No, this is the championship here.
[583:05.92]Fucking Nicole, I would have...
[583:10.47]We held up, though.
[583:11.13]We beat up that little Casper the Friendly Ghost Magician weirdo.
[583:19.08]NA math?
[583:20.06]Come on, it's almost 4 o'clock in the morning.
[583:22.46]I've been streaming for 10 hours.
[583:24.62]Sorry I couldn't do quick math.
[583:29.19]Fucking Nicole.
[583:31.41]Gained fame, that's fine.
[583:38.22]Alright.
[583:40.49]Got about 15 minutes.
[583:42.63]I'm not turning the stream off until 10 hours, just because I want that to be like a milestone where I can look back and go, 10 hours, wow, I did it.
[583:51.62]So, by the time, that'll give us enough time to do the credits.
[583:57.24]Learn some new shit.
[584:00.32]Sure, let's praise him.
[584:00.99]Let's save it.
[584:02.31]Do the credits.
[584:04.37]Then I'm going to live stream myself sleeping.
[584:15.56]No, we ended it right.
[584:17.36]With a loss.
[584:17.88]But at least we got to beat the shit out of that weird ghost person.
[584:24.14]Yeah, man.
[584:24.73]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[584:32.59]Double sail.
[584:33.59]Oh, no.
[584:35.91]No.
[584:38.12]I have to do this now.
[584:39.20]I have to do this.
[584:39.82]I have to.
[584:42.10]Go.
[584:42.56]Do it.
[584:45.10]Yeah, do it.
[584:45.92]I have to.
[584:46.96]I could get a fucking rare monster.
[584:50.91]Go.
[584:54.79]It's possible.
[584:56.99]And then I could bring this rare monster to Monster Rancher 3.
[585:05.31]Find the secret treasure.
[585:10.73]Survive.
[585:17.06]Break it.
[585:20.80]Good work.
[585:25.36]Okay, we got a little bit of a... No, I can't break this.
[585:32.29]Come on, that's horseshit.
[585:33.13]Okay, break this one.
[585:39.61]Can't break that one.
[585:42.94]Okay.
[585:48.02]Come on.
[585:50.39]I'm going too far.
[585:54.59]I'm way too far out.
[585:56.43]I'm at 80.
[585:57.75]What's this?
[585:58.57]What is this?
[586:00.19]Ancient people.
[586:01.09]Okay, investigate it.
[586:04.55]Well, shall we investigate?
[586:05.51]Yes, absolutely.
[586:06.15]Go get me one.
[586:15.38]Get me one.
[586:17.66]No, you went in the same direction.
[586:25.39]Last time, get me something.
[586:28.50]Oh my god, you walked by everything.
[586:46.70]Fucking hell.
[586:54.44]By the way... I don't know where I am.
[587:01.41]Found it.
[587:04.37]The bloodline... the lineage can continue, right?
[587:08.49]Yes.
[587:10.79]We're safe.
[587:21.54]Why did I walk past the thing?
[587:22.92]What do you mean, walk past the thing?
[587:29.36]What did I do?
[587:30.98]Never mind, he saves it every single time?
[587:32.82]What?
[587:38.94]I walked past what?
[587:46.50]I had no energy.
[587:47.32]What was I supposed to do?
[587:50.32]I don't understand.
[587:54.18]The thing to search for, but you would have died.
[587:56.42]Yeah, I didn't go in it because I wasn't... Are you serious?
[588:00.08]I broke the log in the tent that was over on the right.
[588:02.97]If I did it once, I would be dead.
[588:04.13]Don't worry.
[588:07.99]We're going to smelt this guy down to his innards.
[588:12.51]We're going to bring him to Monster Rancher 3.
[588:20.20]Zero energy?
[588:20.82]Doesn't it take 10 energy to go in there once?
[588:22.72]Alright, that's it.
[588:28.48]Let's do the credits.
[588:32.59]Save it.
[588:37.33]You did nothing wrong, it's fine.
[588:38.81]Okay, I'm scared.
[588:42.02]Oh, Monster Rancher has been a great experience.
[588:44.14]What a fun game.
[588:45.16]Seriously.
[588:48.75]Thank you to Bake Me Home for the $5.
[588:49.99]Oh boy, I decided to skip today's stream and catch up tomorrow, and I log in to see a nine-hour and counting VOD waiting for me.
[588:56.47]Cheer.
[588:58.57]It is, that is true.
[588:59.47]It is here.
[589:01.75]Wild Hub Buddy, thanks for the 25 cents.
[589:03.27]You just Ben Kenobi'd Ofri.
[589:06.19]Also, congrats on the first 10-hour stream, buddy.
[589:08.45]Thank you.
[589:09.81]Don't expect these very often, but if we have something that I'm interested in, sure.
[589:17.26]MooMeetsMoo, thank you for the $1.
[589:20.92]When you stream Monster Rancher 3 or 4, please do a bit where you feed a monster nothing but fish and then have a family dinner with it by turning on your webcam and taking a bite from a raw fish.
[589:29.90]Thank you in advance.

[590:48.73]Thank you, everybody here.
[590:51.57]We're doing it again.
[590:52.57]It's because I sped it up last time.

[592:00.77]Here's what we're gonna do.
[592:01.97]This is a lot.
[592:03.15]I can't do it.
[592:03.83]My brain is fucking insane.
[592:06.65]I skipped so many people.
[592:08.03]I know.
[592:08.55]We're gonna roll them again.
[592:15.54]Just read the list.
[592:16.36]There is no list.
[592:19.12]It was ten hours ago.
[592:22.08]It only keeps a certain amount of time.
[592:25.00]Here we go.
[592:28.02]All right, okay, I can prepare myself.
[592:29.48]I already got a lot of these guys here.
[592:31.68]Thank you all to the resubs.
[592:33.08]It's not even fucking slower or faster.
[592:34.50]It didn't save.
[592:34.90]I got to be on top of this.

[595:27.04]Yeah, of course there are.
[595:27.92]I'm not going anywhere.
[595:30.57]Make one more attempt or I'll try to get where I left off there because we got five minutes.
[595:35.27]So roll them again.
[595:38.84]I know where I left off.
[595:39.72]It was like I got the last quadrant and I'll get it.

[598:20.51]Then we're good.
[598:26.83]Thank you so much, everybody, for even considering giving money to this stream.
[598:31.97]I love you all.
[598:32.49]You guys are fucking incredible.
[598:33.47]Thank you.
[598:40.80]Thank you.
[598:41.10]Move means move for the $1.
[598:42.10]Hey, Jeremy, it might be worth it to edit a version of the Getting Tea video with the song itself so you don't have to play them.
[598:46.12]Yeah, the issue was I just have to make my own version.
[598:50.59]I have to make my own video and just render it in Premiere.
[598:53.35]Just haven't had a lot of time to do it.
[598:55.61]That's on the cards, though.
[598:57.03]I'll do that while I have no power and I generate it with my P. But no, thank you so much, man.
[599:06.00]I'm pretty sure you skipped some.
[599:07.12]Go again.
[599:08.14]Please.
[599:09.14]Nah, I didn't.
[599:16.78]Oh, my God.
[599:20.52]That just blew my mind for a minute.
[599:25.06]I can do that in Movie Maker.
[599:26.16]I can do it in Premiere.
[599:27.83]It'll take like 10 minutes.
[599:29.25]Oh, look, something happened.
[599:33.15]Who gave some money?
[599:33.95]Somebody did.
[599:35.83]Where'd it go?
[599:38.15]We're going to count this down.
[599:39.06]Thank you, Bop Rip, for the two bucks.
[599:41.26]They just say cheer, cheer.
[599:42.26]All right, hold on a minute.
[599:44.10]A few seconds here.
[599:46.61]There we go, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one!
[599:56.76]And the- Fuck.
[599:57.74]Happy New Year!
[600:17.05]Thanks, everybody, for sticking around for the new year.
[600:19.61]January 1st, 2018.
[600:24.01]Get your resolutions out there, everybody.
[600:33.77]This is me singing, by the way.
[600:34.97]Happy New Year 2008.
[600:48.09]I got a fucking ad.
[600:51.59]No.
[600:52.17]That's not something like huge, insane achievement or anything.
[600:55.35]But it's the first time I've ever done a stream that's 10 hours.
[601:00.75]Or a stream that's longer than 7 or 8 hours, actually.
[601:07.69]Thank you, everybody, for watching.
[601:09.83]Take care.
[601:13.51]Much love to you.
[601:15.07]See you on Thursday.
[601:15.95]We're gonna play a bunch of shit.
[601:18.44]We have a lot of new stuff to play.
[601:20.27]We're going to put PlayStation 1 on the rack.
[601:22.99]Actually, PlayStation 1 pretty much permanently on the rack until maybe a little bit later down the row when I make some more purchases.
[601:29.49]But expect some new shit.
[601:32.09]We got A Way Out coming out here on Friday.
[601:35.55]That's the made one.
[601:37.69]But see you on Thursday.
[601:39.35]Nothing tomorrow or nothing today, technically, because it is today.
[601:43.70]Have a good sleep, everybody.
[601:45.30]Take care.
[601:47.13]I'll see you all soon.
[601:48.91]And Fred Flintstone's blasting blaster, they're 35 cents.
[601:54.82]I broke you and I can do it again.
[601:56.24]I just didn't expect it.
[601:57.24]And I said it like really loudly and it just killed me.
[602:00.96]And thank you Garfield for the 25 cents.
[602:02.91]DC ruins everything yet again.
[602:04.21]My new year resolution is to always stay positive and always murder those Mondays.
[602:07.99]Sorry about the voodoo curse.
[602:09.15]Love you.
[602:09.49]Thank you.
[602:11.27]Good night, everybody.
[602:12.55]See you on Thursday.
[602:14.09]Take care.
[602:14.77]Good night.
[602:27.86]you
