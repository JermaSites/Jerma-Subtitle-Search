[ve:60.16.100]

[00:58.32]How you doing?
[01:02.31]Welcome back to a, uh, stream.
[01:05.95]You doing good?
[01:06.55]Hope you're doing well.
[01:09.35]It's pretty cool!
[01:11.95]We're back on Sunday for uh, some more Omega Gaming weekend.
[01:18.64]I told you I thought maybe I'd be here on Monday or.. Sunday maybe, I don't know.
[01:27.93]If you missed the last stream, it was a 14 hour stream.
[01:31.66]We went all the way into Saturday.
[01:35.02]Now here we are on Sunday.
[01:37.92]To do some more of what I would... what I've coined, you know.
[01:40.94]And trademarks and stuff like that, trying to figure it out.
[01:44.91]Omega gaming weekend.
[01:48.93]So yeah, that's really cool.
[01:54.83]He's keeping promises kept.
[01:56.21]He's keeping his promises.
[02:00.21]I was actually in here at the pre-stream.
[02:04.43]And... had the sus change to Monday.
[02:08.11]And I was like, no, no, just kidding, I'm doing today.
[02:15.38]I mean, a lot of people that got, you know, they made Omega Gaming Weekend t-shirts were a little annoyed when I made it on Monday.
[02:20.78]But yeah, today we're going to be doing Breath of the Wild...
[02:28.75]I'm going in here with a completely open mind.
[02:32.75]I am not going to say anything about a FromSoftware game that I may have played recently, six months ago, whatever.
[02:42.20]I've never played Breath of the Wild.
[02:44.10]I don't know- all I know about B- this is all I know.
[02:47.90]All I know, is it's an open world Zelda game where your weapons break.
[02:55.24]That's it.
[02:57.43]I don't know anything else.
[02:59.83]So if you're going to be a backseat Barry today, just keep in mind, I have no idea what you're even referring to.
[03:08.90]If I need help, I'll ask for it, or I might just look over a chat and just see the answer.
[03:23.71]Backseat Barrys, yep.
[03:25.89]Mald incoming.
[03:27.57]Can you even mald?
[03:30.99]Can you mald in a Zelda game?
[03:33.11]Is that even possible?
[03:38.87]I don't... Okay, let's also talk about this real quick.
[03:42.69]The last Zelda game that I opened, was... Chlorine Eyes Princess.
[03:50.55]That's the last one I played.
[03:59.12]A Twilight Princess.
[03:59.86]Sorry, that's what it was.
[04:00.44]Twilight Princess.
[04:04.08]Sorry, I got it wrong.
[04:05.52]Yeah, Twilight Princess is the last one that I played and I stopped after the first three hours.
[04:10.20]I couldn't- I hate the way that game looks.
[04:14.79]That- that whole game looks like you opened your eyes in a pool and then looked at light.
[04:19.33]It's chlorine eyes.
[04:20.25]That whole game is chlorine eyes.
[04:21.73]I can't- I cannot play it.
[04:31.16]All the bloom.
[04:31.89]There's so much weird bloom.
[04:33.79]Chlorine bloom.
[04:35.15]But that's the last- and I didn't play anything else after that.
[04:40.11]And I've never played Wind Waker.
[04:42.65]The only thing I know about Wind Waker is... And there's a boat on the screen.
[04:50.12]I don't know anything else!
[04:56.60]Play that too.
[05:01.43]You would like it.
[05:02.21]But I don't really play Zelda.
[05:03.52]I'm telling you, I just don't really play Zelda games.
[05:05.76]Let's see if my opinion will change.
[05:08.58]Let's find out.
[05:09.56]I'm ready to go right now.
[05:10.70]Did I tweet?
[05:16.44]It's so good.
[05:17.82]I know, it's so good.
[05:20.60]Okay, what's better?
[05:22.11]One's in the chat if Breath of the Wild is better, two in the chat if Wind Waker's better.
[05:26.29]What's better?
[05:27.69]What should- What should I be playing right now?
[05:32.57]If you had a choice right now, if the genie showed up and said, I will change it to- whatever.
[05:38.88]I will make him play Wind Waker right now.
[05:47.60]What a stupid wish.
[05:53.75]What a bad wish.
[05:56.93]The genie is here.
[05:57.77]I will do whatever you ask!
[05:59.59]You have three wishes!
[06:01.97]Hey, this 37-year-old man-child on the internet, can you make him play Wind Waker, please?
[06:09.29]Yeah, Wind Waker, that's the one.
[06:11.22]Make him do it.
[06:17.60]No, excuse me, I'm a man.
[06:20.08]I'm just, I'm a man.
[06:25.27]Sorry, I'm a man.
[06:33.25]No, I'm not- no, I'm not.
[06:34.41]I'm a man.
[06:41.27]Okay, I just looked down and I'm hoping that I could- Okay, so I don't have a- I don't have a Star Wars shirt on.
[06:46.69]I- I picked- I almost did.
[06:54.34]I looked down, I thought I had a Star Wars shirt on.
[06:58.26]Not today!
[06:59.77]We're just... standard default adult gray!
[07:05.05]Sorry!
[07:06.87]Nothing on it!
[07:14.34]Villain hair?
[07:15.03]Yeah, maybe a little.
[07:16.93]I- I- we gotta test something here because the way that you capture, uh, you know, I'm living with- I'm using technology from, like, 2013.
[07:25.29]Still.
[07:25.60]And I know, dude, just get, like, a professional capture card.
[07:29.34]I- it's never gonna happen because that requires me to have to go get, like, actually get one.
[07:33.52]But we need to do this.
[07:34.86]You ready?
[07:36.67]And I was like, just get it on Amazon.
[07:37.79]But every time I do an Amazon order for anything, I always, I think of like, okay, what do I want?
[07:42.39]And then two or three important things just never make it to the list.
[07:46.55]Ever.
[07:49.05]Okay, so you're going to tell me if this is matching up.
[07:52.22]Both webcam, audio, and on the screen.
[07:54.26]You ready?
[07:55.88]So there could- tell me if there's a delay.
[07:59.43]Go.
[08:00.59]Options.
[08:01.47]Ability controls.
[08:03.13]1, 2, 3.
[08:05.21]1, 2, 3.
[08:06.82]1, 2, 3.
[08:07.30]1, 2, 3.
[08:08.60]We good?
[08:11.16]So that means I got it right.
[08:12.00]Alright, I got it right.
[08:14.86]You guys ready?
[08:17.28]Are you pumped?
[08:20.86]This is a Sunday of Omega Gaming Weekend.
[08:27.10]Alright, so this is the... Yeah, I opened it and I didn't watch the opening cutscene because I don't care.
[08:31.84]So, let's go.
[08:33.88]It was on in the background.
[08:34.66]I was like... I was going like this.
[08:39.31]Nice frames.
[08:40.05]What do you mean nice frames?
[08:43.89]Is this game 30 FPS?
[08:46.67]Did I have something wrong?
[08:47.71]There's a bingo card going.
[08:49.01]I don't even want to see it.
[08:53.45]It's 30 FPS?
[09:00.53]Wait, what are you saying?
[09:02.13]This game is 30 FPS?
[09:11.70]Hey, Bloodborne's one of my favorite games ever made, and that's 30 FPS.
[09:16.18]So, quiet.
[09:19.73]I need two headphones for this shit.
[09:21.69]There's no LP.
[09:28.09]That is a Sheikah Slate.
[09:29.59]Take it, it will help you...
[09:30.69]Are the classic sound effects in it, too?
[09:38.30]Oh, he's got... Is that a Wii U?
[09:40.68]Was this a Wii U game?
[09:41.44]What did this come out for?
[09:42.18]A mysterious tablet with a glowing center.
[09:45.38]You've never seen this device before, and yet there's something familiar about it.
[09:48.25]Are there annoying puzzles in this game?
[09:56.37]No, this was on... this wasn't Wii U. This was a Switch release, right?
[10:06.67]Okay.
[10:06.83]Are these all treasures?
[10:12.96]Wait, are they chests?
[10:16.48]Well-worn trousers.
[10:17.56]These old trousers are threadbare in spots, but they're surprisingly comfortable.
[10:21.70]The legs are a bit too short, though.
[10:23.30]Okay.
[10:23.56]there's gear?
[10:30.56]Okay.
[10:33.22]Nice.
[10:35.22]So what is that, like, Hearthstone card pack that I have?
[10:37.68]What is that?
[10:38.78]Is that, like, the slate?
[10:41.87]Alright, I got pants.
[10:45.55]How has he never played this before?
[10:47.47]I don't play Zelda.
[10:49.47]Actually, this is the first Zelda game I played in probably 15 years.
[10:51.85]Ooh, shirt!
[10:59.43]Wait, you can pick stuff up?
[11:00.49]Particle effects, pretty good.
[11:05.60]It's got physics.
[11:06.18]Okay...
[11:13.40]Pretty good.
[11:15.04]Do naked no armor run.
[11:16.40]Is this kind of like, um... Alright.
[11:20.14]Should we make a running encounter?
[11:23.68]Try to do this without mentioning any FromSoftware game?
[11:27.00]How?
[11:32.98]I don't think I can do that.
[11:36.74]Don't ask chat for advice.
[11:38.92]LOL.
[11:39.56]The game is self-explanatory.
[11:41.29]Okay.
[11:41.79]I'm not, I'm not looking over here.
[11:51.11]So that's how you... It's like a key.
[11:52.23]Okay.
[11:57.49]I didn't make the title, uh, one of the mods did.
[11:59.19]It's pretty good, though, and I can't, I don't think I can delete it.
[12:10.27]No intro?
[12:11.31]Um, well, I already saw it.
[12:13.87]It was, uh, did the thing that video games- hold on. 
[12:29.07]Okay.
[12:31.89]Uh, it did the thing that video games like to do, where, and I hate this... I want a menu before anything happens.
[12:40.65]Anything.
[12:41.71]I don't want an opening cutscene, I don't want a get into the game and here's the tutorial but you can't access the menu.
[12:46.66]I, give me the menu immediately.
[12:50.18]Immediately.
[12:53.07]Once I do my settings, it-it should- a pop-up should come up and be like, hey, do you give a shit about doing your settings?
[12:59.31]Just hit B if you don't care.
[13:00.81]And then, whatever, you can do that whole thing out.
[13:03.00]But I want to change the gamma.
[13:05.04]I want to change the uh, field of view.
[13:08.20]I want to change the audio levels.
[13:10.96]I don't want to just see the opening cutscene.
[13:15.88]God, if I made a game, God, it would be the best game ever made.
[13:19.00]It would sell a hundred fucking billion copies.
[13:22.18]It would be so good that- yeah, that would be- each person would own 10 copies of my game.
[13:27.30]It's just so goddamn good.
[13:31.02]Jump is X?
[13:31.92]That's kind of weird.
[13:32.52]Alright, B is sprint.
[13:38.49]I don't like that.
[13:39.07]I want it to be... I want B to be jump.
[13:46.65]Okay, hold on a second.
[13:49.53]This is a switch controller.
[13:50.68]I forgot...
[13:53.36]I'll fix it in a minute.
[14:00.72]Okay, so there's like a grip meter.
[14:04.23]Wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on...
[14:20.88]Wow.
[14:38.25]Okay.
[14:43.07]No, I'm not gonna say it.
[14:44.13]I won't.
[14:44.67]Okay, if I make 10 Elden Ring references this stream, then I have to eat a bug on camera.
[14:51.31]No, I'm not doing that.
[14:55.49]Do you guys remember the old Fear Factor fucking- whatever they were... videos?
[15:02.62]What was going on?
[15:03.88]I can't even stand it.
[15:07.51]Eating fucking, like, live insects.
[15:10.05]Like, what the fuck?
[15:11.49]What are we doing?
[15:13.85]I- It was horrible.
[15:15.31]I couldn't take it.
[15:16.17]Okay, wooden branches such as these are pretty common, alright.
[15:25.41]Wait, I have a branch for a weapon?
[15:27.69]This... Okay.
[15:31.98]Attack with your weapon.
[15:37.00]Alright, that's kinda cool.
[15:37.94]Can I use the branch for the whole game?
[15:45.32]Yeah, this is all fucked up.
[15:47.00]This is all fucked up, hold on a second.
[15:52.98]Change jump button.
[15:54.20]On.
[15:55.91]Wait, what?
[15:59.43]Oh, there we go.
[16:03.01]So now, where, what is sprint?
[16:04.83]Sprint is X?
[16:08.66]Mmm, I think that's alright.
[16:16.51]Wait, I broke it already?
[16:17.41]I didn't even touch anything.
[16:22.33]Why is it already broken?
[16:28.16]Mushrooms.
[16:28.62]Okay, you can eat these.
[16:35.50]You smashed it.
[16:36.18]What?
[16:36.86]Did I already ruin something?
[16:40.42]You're covering the map.
[16:41.64]Oh, I'll go like this then.
[16:42.60]Is that better?
[16:51.63]Better?
[16:51.87]Okay, that's throw.
[17:07.30]Who needs a weapon?
[17:08.06]Fuck it.
[17:09.24]How do you get another weapon?
[17:14.74]I don't actually need that, right?
[17:16.66]It's a... Where is- where is that?
[17:21.43]Oh, okay.
[17:22.87]Ooh, alright.
[17:31.65]And you can stamp too.
[17:32.77]Okay, cool.
[17:33.17]So I gotta go this way?
[17:33.93]Cool, alright.
[17:37.27]Follow the Sheikah Slate.
[17:43.58]Baked apple.
[17:45.76]Beg your pardon.
[17:46.46]I do believe that is my baked apple.
[17:48.88]You can't just go around taking whatever you please.
[17:51.74]Oho ho, forgive me.
[17:52.26]I could not resist pulling your leg.
[17:53.90]Please help yourself.
[17:54.74]An apple a day keeps the doctor away, as they say.
[17:57.64]Don't they, Link?
[17:58.92]It's a succulent treat.
[18:01.29]Who are you?
[18:02.83]Me?
[18:03.21]I'm Ganondorf.
[18:04.67]You see, I'm going to have a fucking big Santa Claus beard on for the whole game and then I'm going to take it off and at the end you're going to be fighting me as Ganon.
[18:11.91]I win.
[18:14.02]I'm just an old fool who's lived here alone for quite some time.
[18:16.48]I'm not Ganondorf, don't worry.
[18:21.88]What brings a bright-eyed young man here?
[18:26.24]Answering a question with a question, that's fair enough.
[18:28.72]As I cannot imagine our meeting to be a simple coincidence, I shall tell you.
[18:32.65]This is the Great Plateau.
[18:33.69]According to legend, this is the birthplace of the entire kingdom of Hyrule.
[18:38.69]Why do I look like this?
[18:42.01]I don't know.
[18:43.47]Why did I read that?
[18:44.97]Of the five million comments that were just coming through.
[18:48.13]Okay, cool.
[18:48.55]This is the birthplace of Hyrule.
[18:52.25]That's... No, it's going to say Ganon's dad.
[18:53.85]This is fucking Gondendorf.
[19:01.86]That temple there long ago was the site of many sacred ceremonies.
[19:06.12]Ever since the decline of the kingdom a hundred years ago, it has sat abandoned in a state of decay.
[19:13.26]Yet another forgotten entity, a mere ghost of its former self.
[19:17.06]Interesting.
[19:26.37]That's right.
[19:27.91]That'll be- that'll be $500, because that was a cool magic trick, and I didn't even ask you for money.
[19:32.33]That'll be $1,000, please, for that kind of personal show.
[19:34.29]Oh, cool.
[19:43.35]Well, then just help yourself to that torch there, and how may I ask you planning to use it?
[19:47.30]Um, it's a secret.
[19:49.34]To set things on fire.
[19:51.72]It's rather unnerving.
[19:52.62]Please be cautious with that around any dry grass.
[19:56.52]You know, there are plenty of monsters in this area.
[19:58.00]That torch would make a good weapon if need be.
[20:00.70]Don't just swing it around without purpose.
[20:02.02]You must face your opponents and lock your sights on them.
[20:05.61]Yeah, right.
[20:06.31]Obviously.
[20:13.78]Okay.
[20:14.52]I'm just testing it.
[20:15.10]Do I have to light it?
[20:21.14]How do I light the torch?
[20:22.55]Okay.
[20:23.81]Got it.
[20:24.15]Now what?
[20:24.45]Let's go.
[20:28.69]I'm holding this as if I don't know what to do with this.
[20:33.83]Right?
[20:34.05]This is like, this is like, I don't know what to do with this item.
[20:36.89]Wait, is this an axe?
[20:39.33]Woodcutter's axe.
[20:40.38]Oh shit, cool.
[20:43.26]No, I don't want to put that on.
[20:46.98]Change weapon.
[20:48.68]Press and hold.
[20:49.35]And then switch.
[20:55.91]What?
[21:00.63]Is this a camera?
[21:07.62]How do I zoom out?
[21:12.57]Did I just take a picture?
[21:14.99]Okay.
[21:15.55]Um... I gotta go that way.
[21:23.97]How do I switch?
[21:24.51]It said hold what?
[21:26.43]How do I switch weapons?
[21:30.27]It said hold this and then press... Oh, okay.
[21:33.19]There it is.
[21:33.83]Yeah.
[21:33.99]Alright, I'm ready.
[21:36.23]Let's move.
[21:42.89]Acorn.
[21:43.31]So you can just, wait, you just eat nuts and seeds and shit?
[21:48.38]20 rupees under there!
[21:58.89]Okay, cool.
[21:59.61]Let's move.
[22:16.48]Did I get him?
[22:17.20]Oh!
[22:20.14]Is there a dodge roll?
[22:26.56]What the fuck?
[22:28.89]Is there a dodge roll?
[22:35.91]Okay, got him.
[22:39.49]Is it jump?
[22:43.44]Bokoblin Fang.
[22:46.35]Cook it alongside a critter to make it an elixir.
[22:49.29]Wait, I cook their teeth?
[22:52.99]Okay, cool.
[22:56.07]Wasting durability on weak enemies.
[22:57.63]What do you mean wasting durability?
[22:59.78]I don't know what that... What do you mean?
[23:00.68]How do I go to the... What do you mean wasting durability?
[23:14.43]How can I see how much durability this has?
[23:17.88]Should I use the stick or something for now?
[23:24.10]Wait, search.
[23:25.90]Ancient spring.
[23:26.72]Okay, cool.
[23:31.62]Can I get some more sticks?
[23:40.00]How do you block?
[23:46.65]Can I punch?
[23:47.93]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[23:58.68]Ooh, he dropped a turkey leg.
[24:13.98]How long does it take to break stuff?
[24:16.58]Should I actually not be using this?
[24:19.54]Look at this-t his thing's sick.
[24:21.00]I'm going to hold on to the turkey leg.
[24:24.25]It depends.
[24:24.95]It doesn't take long.
[24:26.55]Is there a durability menu?
[24:28.17]Can I see which one is low and high?
[24:31.33]Don't even... Who cares?
[24:31.99]Don't even worry about it?
[24:32.63]Alright.
[24:32.83]I'm just going to keep the axe on.
[24:33.79]How come the title says horsies, by the way?
[24:39.64]Is there a horse...
[24:48.05]Can you climb this?
[25:01.40]I found a bird up here.
[25:06.89]Oh, I'm just stealing the eggs.
[25:18.36]He found his way?
[25:19.16]I mean, if this is- this is just- hey, alright.
[25:26.15]So, I'm gonna push that over here and kill these guys.
[25:42.28]What happens when you die?
[25:46.67]When was the last- What?
[25:47.25]When was the last save?
[25:52.65]Why did I just explode?
[25:54.63]They... Do I still have everything?
[26:00.91]No, I'm good.
[26:01.51]I'm good.
[26:02.23]Okay, that was fine.
[26:03.59]So, wait.
[26:04.11]Do you have to pick your body up?
[26:17.36]Hey, come get me.
[26:19.00]How do I- can I get their attention?
[26:52.80]How did I get hit by that?
[26:55.06]Oh, cooked turkey!
[27:05.09]Pick up souls?
[27:10.56]Where are they?
[27:11.04]I don't see them anywhere.
[27:12.14]Are you- are they actually on the ground?
[27:14.58]There's an X on the screen.
[27:23.04]Dude, I, hah... hmm... I actually don't like it like that.
[27:38.86]The sprint really needs to be... But- no, it sucks that way.
[27:42.05]I don't like it like that.
[27:44.75]I'll keep it the other way.
[27:45.45]I'll have to get used to it.
[27:48.97]Why can't I just map it?
[27:53.85]Okay, that's really funny to me that there's a change the jump button rebind, but it just makes it a different one that you can't determine what you want to do.
[28:02.99]You want to remap jump?
[28:04.57]Well, you can only make it this other one button.
[28:09.12]Okay, let's go.
[28:10.22]Get a better PC?
[28:31.00]What's this?
[28:31.24]I got a bow?
[28:32.68]Okay, right trigger is bow.
[28:39.90]How do I fire?
[28:43.32]Is he throwing fucking rocks?
[28:46.74]Alright, there's tons of shit here.
[28:51.77]Oh, I didn't have any arrows.
[28:54.99]Arrows, horn.
[28:57.73]Very cool.
[28:58.25]Alright.
[28:58.51]Should I eat an apple?
[29:02.46]Or eat something?
[29:09.50]Tasty.
[29:18.00]No arrow Andy.
[29:22.50]Good one, thanks.
[29:23.00]I appreciate it.
[29:26.00]I was hoping at least one of you... would care.
[29:30.87]Wait, hidden cave?
[29:32.17]No, I'm supposed to go here.
[29:32.97]Okay, so cool.
[29:33.85]So this is the first little area.
[29:34.87]This is my first dungeon?
[29:43.65]First dungeon?
[29:51.26]Link, it's a rectangle the size of the device.
[29:53.74]Just put it in.
[29:59.11]You can rebind in the actual menu.
[30:01.13]Really?
[30:04.24]You can?
[30:29.10]That pig... Default noise.
[30:42.61]Oh shit.
[30:43.11]Cool.
[30:59.65]That's pretty, uh... That's pretty cool.
[31:08.00]Great Plateau Tower.
[31:14.98]Distilling local information.
[31:24.43]Here it comes.
[31:39.00]Oh it's... th- never mind I'm not gonna say it.
[31:43.00]I'm not gonna have you guys keep track of the times I say it.
[31:48.00]But it is that thing from that other game, that I've played.
[32:13.35]Why didn't anybody wake me up?
[32:44.39]He doesn't care?
[32:46.03]Why are you even saying that?
[32:47.21]Mirrored cam?
[32:47.87]No, it's not a mirrored cam.
[32:50.19]Alright, so now... I opened up that.
[32:53.21]Which, that's... Okay, that's the very end of the game, right?
[32:56.29]I have to go there, I have to dip the axe into the mountain to get the... encrusted- fucking- like... Dairy Queen cherry dip on the axe.
[33:03.88]Right?
[33:05.12]And then I gotta go over here on the left and I have to mold the handle out of clay.
[33:08.72]The hardest clay that was put in the kiln... up here in the mountain of, uh, of the, of ovens and stuff.
[33:14.07]And then, yeah, I'll be there eventually.
[33:18.09]I'll be there eventually.
[33:21.14]That's how it worked in the other ones, right?
[33:22.26]Like, you have to go get this part from the sword and go get this from over here and get this sword.
[33:26.85]I haven't played Zelda in fucking 15 years.
[33:29.75]I have no idea how it works.
[33:34.47]Don't you, like, make the Master Sword in all these games?
[33:37.86]Isn't that the whole point?
[33:38.50]I thought that's what the entire point of all these games was.
[33:42.86]It's like, oh, you have to get the Master Sword.
[34:15.93]We got that out of the way.
[34:16.77]That's right.
[34:20.01]Okay.
[34:20.81]How do I get down from here?
[34:30.85]Can I go faster than this?
[34:40.05]Can you- how do you climb faster?
[35:02.73]Okay, this tower and others just like it have erupted across the land, one after another.
[35:07.11]It's almost as though a long dormant power has awoken quite suddenly.
[35:11.95]You do not mind me asking, did anything odd occur while you were atop that tower?
[35:16.98]I'm revealing no information.
[35:20.76]I saw the whole thing.
[35:22.36]You don't have to hide it from me.
[35:23.30]Well, why ask the question then?
[35:27.06]Although I could not hear anything, I did see you react as if you heard something coming from the direction of the castle.
[35:36.70]Okay.
[35:40.21]Did you recognize this voice?
[35:41.51]Let's see if you can go two for two.
[35:45.53]Hmm, seems I have some work to do as far as earning your trust goes.
[35:48.25]I suppose that is understandable.
[35:52.55]I assume you caught sight of that atrocity enshrouding the castle.
[35:58.07]That is Calamity Ganon.
[36:00.89]100 years ago, that vile entity brought the kingdom of Hyrule to ruin.
[36:09.08]It appeared suddenly, and destroyed everything in its path.
[36:12.58]So many innocent lives were lost in its wake.
[36:15.34]For a century, the very symbol of our kingdom, Hyrule Castle, has managed to contain that evil.
[36:21.42]But just barely.
[36:23.10]There it festers, building its strength for the moment it will unleash its blight upon the land once again.
[36:29.24]It would appear that moment is fast approaching.
[36:39.73]Do you intend to make your way to the castle?
[36:41.16]I do.
[36:42.92]I had a feeling you would say that.
[36:49.60]Here on this isolated plateau, we are surrounded on all sides by steep cliffs with no way down.
[36:56.04]If you were to try to jump off, well, no death could be more certain or more foolish.
[37:01.92]Of course, if you had a paraglider like mine, that would be another story.
[37:04.88]Gimme it.
[37:07.86]Certainly, why not?
[37:08.85]But there is no such thing as a free item in this world, you know.
[37:12.17]Let's see now.
[37:12.89]How about I trade it for a bit of treasure that slumbers nearby?
[37:15.43]Okay.
[37:22.35]So you get quests and stuff?
[37:27.04]Okay.
[37:28.72]Cool.
[37:29.02]Yeah.
[37:29.22]Let's track this one.
[37:32.31]Let me show you something.
[37:50.68]I did not think that... I was seeing... Okay.
[37:53.36]Well, I... Oops.
[37:56.61]I'm following you.
[37:57.67]You said, follow me.
[37:59.03]I'm following you.
[38:04.54]See that structure?
[38:05.32]The one shining with a strange light?
[38:08.56]Yeah.
[38:10.36]It began glowing at the exact moment these towers rose up from the ground.
[38:13.54]It must be a dungeon.
[38:20.22]Okay.
[38:23.37]I would think such a place might house some sort of treasure.
[38:25.63]Alright, let's go.
[38:27.90]Fair exchange for the paraglider.
[38:35.08]Oh, you can swim.
[38:35.74]Okay, cool.
[38:38.96]Okay, does everything break or anything?
[38:41.04]I just caught a fish in my mouth.
[38:52.99]What?
[38:54.35]I thought that was... Wait, hold on.
[38:59.43]I'm alright.
[39:00.36]Okay, I'm gonna be alright.
[39:02.50]I just drowned in a three foot deep pool.
[39:05.38]I'm sorry.
[39:10.18]I thought that was just like, okay.
[39:13.29]I didn't know that was breath.
[39:14.89]I get it now.
[39:15.37]I get it, I get it, I get it.
[39:18.43]I thought that was just my stamina, and then when it was empty, I was going to start, I don't know, getting hurt?
[39:23.91]Or, I don't know.
[39:24.75]I didn't know.
[39:25.25]How was I supposed to know?
[39:35.82]I'm going that way.
[39:55.01]1240.
[39:55.15]Is that real time?
[40:13.54]This is pretty.
[40:26.70]I can't move that rock.
[40:27.58]There's treasure down here.
[40:35.37]Raid song?
[40:35.97]What do you mean, raid song?
[40:40.87]How do I open this?
[40:43.11]Oh, there's a raid.
[40:43.75]Hey, the gray fruit!
[40:44.79]Thanks for the raid!
[40:46.54]Is there... That was a raid?
[40:47.38]That just happened?
[40:48.94]I'm not gonna fucking drown in here.
[40:50.04]I'm dead again.
[40:51.34]I'm dead.
[40:52.50]I'm actually gonna die in this.
[40:54.86]Oh my god, thank goodness.
[40:59.03]You can't swim to treasure.
[41:00.27]It's its own puzzle.
[41:01.47]Oh, okay.
[41:01.79]So let's figure that out.
[41:02.79]Do I have to drain the water?
[41:04.87]Power of fire?
[41:15.20]Wait, I think I know what to do.
[41:23.20]Can I shove this in and, like, displace some water?
[41:25.02]I don't know.
[41:39.74]There's no lever to pull, whatever.
[41:41.14]I can probably do it later.
[41:42.74]Okay, so here we go.
[41:47.20]Let's do it.
[41:59.17]Play the game?
[41:59.67]How am I not playing the game?
[42:05.15]Access granted.
[42:08.82]This seems kind of fun.
[42:10.48]Maybe I will enjoy this.
[42:24.69]Solving puzzles is a big part of the game.
[42:26.17]Don't let chat ruin it for you unless you are stuck.
[42:30.11]Okay.
[42:40.46]To you, who sets foot in this shrine, I am Oman Ao.
[42:45.45]In the name of... Why did I want to press A?
[42:47.73]Is this a temperature?
[42:50.85]There's a degrees temperature?
[43:12.91]Alright, let's do it.
[43:15.03]It's engine oil temperature.
[43:16.39]No help.
[43:16.94]No help.
[43:26.12]Play Disney Infinity 3.0.
[43:27.62]I tried to two days ago, and it didn't work.
[43:33.05]I couldn't capture it and I could barely play it.
[43:35.87]They just, like I said, they just dragged the console port folder over to Unity or something to make it just run.
[43:42.01]I don't even know.
[43:42.53]I have no idea.
[43:43.29]It's one of those ports.
[43:47.10]Manipulate metallic objects using magnetism.
[43:50.60]Grab onto metallic objects using the magnetic energy that pours forth from the Magnesis Ruin.
[43:55.30]Okay, so I can control magnetic powers?
[44:01.36]That's kind of cool.
[44:19.97]Push, pull, oh.
[44:23.72]Cool.
[44:33.26]So you have different little special powers?
[44:55.68]Alright, I got it
[45:30.18]Is that a treasure chest up there?
[45:31.48]Cool.
[45:42.69]Okay, I know how to get that.
[45:45.63]Oh, I can't just pick it up?
[46:02.70]Oh, push.
[46:03.58]Okay.
[46:09.58]Can I make like a bridge?
[46:10.34]I guess not.
[46:27.04]Maybe I can make a bridge.
[46:31.18]What happened?
[46:37.98]What the fuck was that?
[46:42.66]What was that?
[46:45.07]I snapped my neck?
[46:46.49]I wanted to start at the very beginning?
[46:51.23]What?
[47:02.34]You slammed a metal slab directly into your face.
[47:25.01]There's like a hop, isn't there?
[47:26.30]There's always a hop in Zelda games.
[47:30.94]There's like a hop, hop, hop.
[47:33.22]How do I do it?
[47:41.93]How do I do the hop?
[47:50.96]Ancient screw.
[47:52.68]No, it's not the jump.
[47:53.54]It's like a... Usually there's a Bloodborne dash.
[47:58.20]You guys know what I'm talking about, right?
[48:00.69]Doesn't he do like a backflip?
[48:01.87]There's like a... Is that just not in this game?
[48:06.35]Hold target and jump.
[48:10.97]Yeah, but it's not doing it.
[48:12.91]You learn that later.
[48:13.71]Okay.
[48:27.56]I wonder how close I am to actually getting that, because I want it.
[48:29.70]I could probably jump up here.
[48:39.91]I can't tilt this.
[49:02.43]Oh, shit.
[49:02.89]Okay, cool.
[49:08.55]Oh, it's made out of metal.
[49:09.19]That's right.
[49:11.29]Traveler's bow.
[49:12.41]Alright.
[49:18.73]Change bow.
[49:27.61]Now I'll keep this one on.
[49:32.54]Alright, well that's fun.
[49:34.34]What else?
[49:45.37]You seriously suck at this game.
[49:48.53]Dude.
[49:53.22]I don't... I've just started playing it.
[49:57.45]You've proven to possess the resolve of a true hero.
[50:00.91]I am Omen Au, the creator of this trial.
[50:07.92]I am a humble monk, blessed with the sight of goddess Hylia, and dedicated to helping those who seek to defeat Ganon.
[50:14.66]With your arrival, my duty is now fulfilled.
[50:21.96]In the name of goddess Hylia, allow me to bestow this gift upon you.
[50:28.62]Varnish for the Master Sword.
[50:30.70]Can't use it yet though.
[50:39.00]Spirit Orb.
[50:52.52]A symbol of courage given to those who have overcome the challenges of a shrine.
[50:55.84]So what is it?
[50:56.26]Is it like a currency thing?
[50:58.28]And I mean that actually not like the joke from like five years ago.
[51:16.87]Cool.
[51:16.99]Alright.
[51:17.33]So you beat shrines, get currency, get money.
[51:24.88]Get experience.
[51:28.24]It's a soul coin.
[51:29.94]Ooh.
[51:37.63]I'll be really honest.
[51:38.29]To be able to come from that direction and land here, you had to have jumped from like all the way up there.
[51:45.81]You had to have left 20 minutes ago and started gliding down here.
[51:52.77]How would you know that I was gonna be done by whatever?
[51:54.53]Okay.
[51:56.09]Uh, where's the paraglider?
[51:57.93]It's all connected to that Sheikah slate.
[51:58.99]You carry on your hip there.
[52:11.37]What do you mean?
[52:13.14]Well, it's been quite some time since I have seen that Sheikah Slate long ago.
[52:16.58]A highly advanced tribe known as the Sheikah inhabited these lands.
[52:22.04]The great power of their wisdom saved this kingdom time and time again.
[52:26.02]But their ancient technology disappeared long ago, or so it is said.
[52:29.54]It's interesting, however, to think how something like that survived all this time hidden away in a shrine.
[52:37.46]These shrines are tucked away in numerous places across the land.
[52:41.24]On this plateau alone, I believe there are three.
[52:42.86]Three.
[52:46.34]Bring me the treasure from each of these shrines and I will give you my paraglider.
[52:50.76]That was not the deal.
[52:54.96]Oh well, I suppose I changed my mind.
[52:56.38]I'm sure that won't be a problem for a young go-getter like you.
[53:01.60]I'll also teach you a trick for finding shrines.
[53:03.68]Hmm.
[53:05.51]It's always best to survey the area by looking around from a High Point.
[53:07.95]Let's see here.
[53:09.17]How about you make your way to the top of that tower again?
[53:12.03]Really?
[53:12.27]I was just up there.
[53:15.15]That didn't even stick.
[53:18.66]I didn't get anything on me.
[53:19.48]You know what I mean?
[53:25.66]That didn't even apply.
[53:26.52]Okay.
[53:30.33]Take a look at the map on your Sheikah Slate.
[53:35.79]Take a look.
[53:36.13]I sent you a friend request on Pokémon Go.
[53:38.41]It was a few days ago, and you have no pressure, but I mean, I think we could really find some monsters together.
[53:45.91]Okay, see those blue icons?
[53:49.35]You should recognize the cave where you woke, the shrine where you came from, and the tower.
[53:54.98]You can travel instantly to any of those places with the Sheikah Slate.
[54:00.00]Fix that one strand of hair.
[54:02.00]No.
[54:04.97]Alright, so let's go.
[54:08.09]Back up here.
[54:16.20]Wait, I need to figure out this lake puzzle, right?
[54:33.86]If everything's a little puzzle, then I have to figure it out.
[54:41.37]Oh, shit.
[54:41.87]Cool.
[54:42.09]I can... You can chop down trees?
[54:49.33]What's that?
[54:49.65]Alright.
[54:49.88]Wait, there's something interesting here.
[54:52.32]Is this poisonous?
[55:07.56]No, uh, but it apparently is quicksand.
[55:17.62]Wait a minute!
[55:18.12]I have this- wait, I can- can I pull the, uh, treasures from under the- hold on a second.
[55:22.18]I think I got it.
[55:30.69]Those are not treasures?
[55:32.11]I can't- I can't grab those?
[55:33.51]They're not made out of metal?
[56:11.31]What are the- what are the metal?
[56:12.19]See the metal?
[56:43.24]Dude, go back.
[56:44.74]I'm just surveying the area!
[57:07.59]What is that?
[57:13.81]Let him explore.
[57:14.51]There!
[57:22.01]Okay, sorry, I didn't- I didn't- Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[57:24.74]I didn't know what this was attached to!
[57:26.12]Alright, what do I do about this?
[57:27.48]Hold on, wait, I have to put it inside.
[57:45.61]You fucking piece of shit.
[57:57.00]Do I have to score it like a basket?
[58:08.09]Yahaha!
[58:08.63]You found me!
[58:10.11]You're not Hestu, but you can see me?
[58:13.52]I didn't know your kind could see the children of the forest.
[58:19.32]Give this to Hestu.
[58:22.46]Korok seed.
[58:27.33]Okay.
[58:37.44]so so
[59:05.33]No, I want to be able to pick up the item he dropped.
[59:11.51]Oh my god, whatever.
[59:12.79]Do I have to come back here?
[59:39.72]Why is this blinking?
[59:43.38]Why is this blinking?
[59:45.15]It's like, it's like, blink, blink, blink, like, come over here, blink, blink, blink, do something here.
[59:48.47]What is it telling me?
[59:53.35]Oh, those are the arrows.
[59:56.60]I, okay, whatever.
[59:57.86]I'll be, I'll come back later, fuck it.
[60:08.44]They're your arrows.
[60:09.04]Well, I didn't know that they blinked.
[60:28.19]This game's cool.
[60:28.83]I like it.
[60:34.18]What's the height for fall damage?
[60:35.92]Is it bad?
[60:36.36]I don't know.
[60:37.50]I'm just gonna see.
[60:40.84]How high is it?
[60:41.96]Okay.
[60:42.24]Almost there.
[61:28.39]Oh, okay.
[61:30.12]Thank you.
[61:37.12]Thank you.
[61:49.49]I think I've had to sneeze.
[61:50.69]Okay.
[61:53.79]I'm glad I got that out.
[61:55.59]That's been sitting there for the last 45 minutes, I swear to God.
[62:01.72]Okay, you certainly took your time.
[62:02.90]Did you forget how to fast travel?
[62:04.48]Yes, I did.
[62:04.96]Uh-huh.
[62:12.87]Now then, I want you to join me up here so you can look out there to find another... I already see it.
[62:18.99]The scope.
[62:23.05]Oh, that's what I saw before.
[62:23.87]Okay.
[62:25.13]Okay.
[62:34.33]with that.
[62:34.79]Look, it's over there.
[63:00.60]That work?
[63:03.63]Uh, no, I got it.
[63:04.27]Wait.
[63:04.55]Oh, finding the shrines.
[63:06.13]More than one.
[63:06.71]Okay.
[63:15.61]Wait, take those pins away.
[63:16.63]There's way too many.
[63:18.47]How do I get rid of them?
[63:21.53]I'm doing an orbital strike on that place.
[63:23.95]Uh, I want to put... Whatever.
[63:27.03]There's three, right?
[63:27.83]How do I take them down?
[63:45.94]Okay.
[63:47.62]So now there's one more, he said.
[63:49.34]One, two... Did I already get that one?
[63:55.19]Did I already get this one?
[64:04.75]Okay.
[64:08.30]I got them, right?
[64:08.86]Okay.
[64:12.40]The ones you finished turn blue.
[64:14.40]Okay, so then there's three.
[64:15.59]Isn't that what he said?
[64:16.35]To find three of them?
[64:17.87]There are three more.
[64:23.68]Oh, just go to them?
[64:24.54]Okay.
[64:46.52]This one's on the ground level.
[64:47.64]I'm doing this one first.
[64:50.40]I like this.
[64:50.90]This is fun.
[64:55.14]I like this.
[64:55.94]This is cool.
[64:57.58]I'm going to investigate this camp.
[64:58.96]Do you have to sleep or anything?
[65:27.71]Oh, an arm.
[65:31.47]Comes back to life?
[65:46.67]How do you permanently kill these?
[66:07.24]These things are five?
[66:08.49]The woodcutter's axe is dog shit in comparison.
[66:10.69]Alright, I'm gonna keep this for now.
[66:17.47]Alright, I'm gonna... Let me investigate.
[66:21.65]Is there a way to put food on your quick bar or something?
[66:40.78]Completely fucking missed.
[66:41.94]Alright, whatever.
[66:42.46]This thing's already- I touched one thing with it.
[66:51.76]It's a- Why does it just explode?
[67:01.52]Somebody- What happened in there?
[67:07.73]Okay, I guess I'm gonna just loot your whole place.
[67:14.16]Somebody really fucked up in here.
[67:32.76]God damn it.
[67:42.19]That just scared the shit out of me.
[67:48.60]Okay, cool.
[67:50.95]So you can only carry a certain amount of things.
[67:54.51]Let's put the... Let's put the club on.
[68:12.07]I feel like I don't want to eat a lot of this stuff.
[68:13.35]How much is it- do you get for this?
[68:22.98]Spiked club.
[68:23.72]Okay, so what was actually in here?
[68:32.84]You hold right D-pad, you can switch between- alright, that- thank you so much.
[68:36.90]What do we got?
[68:41.16]Fire arrow's cool.
[68:45.11]Got it.
[68:51.11]That was the weirdest way I could have possibly done that.
[68:57.18]Alright, that was cool.
[68:57.94]A little dungeon.
[68:58.66]Little dungeon.
[69:12.27]What should we do now that hell has frozen over?
[69:16.97]Um, I don't know.
[69:23.00]Oh, you can probably activate those and that is a map reveal.
[69:26.80]What's up there?
[69:27.34]Alright, I like this game.
[69:31.14]I like this game.
[69:32.40]I didn't say anything else.
[69:33.96]Everyone hold off.
[69:55.82]Okay, I can grab those.
[69:58.66]I gotta go back to that other shrine.
[70:06.48]Amber.
[70:06.78]It's been valued as a component in decorations and crafting since ancient times.
[70:11.17]Cool.
[70:19.23]And the shrine's right here, right?
[70:50.42]What is the dodge?
[70:51.95]There has to be a dodge.
[71:15.57]Why?
[71:15.83]Because games with two-frame invincibility dodge rolls are my favorite, so I want it to be in everything.
[71:23.59]Alright, I get it.
[71:25.96]I'm gonna hide behind something in the ruins and be fine.
[71:28.24]Ready?
[71:28.40]Watch this.
[71:40.15]Jesus.
[72:12.67]You can't outrun it.
[72:13.43]I was seeing if you could outrun it with a sprint.
[72:21.77]I was seeing if you could outrun it with a sprint!
[72:23.94]Relax!
[72:33.22]Crouch?
[72:58.77]I need a weapon.
[73:18.34]So I can outrun it?
[73:23.96]No, I cannot, actually!
[73:25.82]Stop telling me I can outrun it!
[73:28.50]I'm gonna use my bow, yeah.
[73:38.71]Bro, you can.
[73:39.55]I can- No, you cannot!
[73:45.03]How do I put the bow down?
[73:45.79]Okay.
[74:03.64]What?
[74:04.02]Why can't I hurt this?
[74:32.71]Everything's breaking.
[74:35.13]I shoot it in like the neck.
[74:44.68]Oh shit, it's emote only.
[74:45.56]I actually don't know what I in the head.
[74:47.70]I've always gone.
[75:08.30]What was that for?
[75:09.04]Um, where's the bow?
[75:12.50]No, don't throw this.
[75:14.08]How do I put this down?
[75:14.98]How do you quick equip the bow?
[75:19.44]I have a second bow.
[75:23.12]How do I equip a bow quickly?
[75:37.14]Does it have like a thing on its head?
[75:38.02]Can I climb it?
[75:55.49]I can't hurt this.
[75:56.13]I think, do I have to shoot it in its neck?
[76:11.68]Is that working?
[76:18.87]That's not working.
[76:31.48]I don't think I can kill this.
[76:32.72]I have to go pick up a fucking heavy box and throw it at it.
[76:37.83]I don't get it.
[76:38.47]Shoot it in the eye?
[76:39.18]I am!
[76:48.61]I cannot fight this thing.
[76:50.45]I don't have an item that I need to kill this.
[77:06.23]Yeah, I need the ancient gear to make the ancient gear arrow to shoot in the eye with the ancient gear arrow tip.
[77:16.31]Okay.
[77:39.01]Maybe if I put this in the coin slot.
[77:47.68]Alright, I actually don't know what the fuck to do.
[77:52.10]What about shooting the ears?
[77:57.69]I think I just have to shoot it there.
[77:59.33]I actually think I should just keep doing this over and over again.
[78:15.00]No, that's wrong.
[78:16.22]Nay, nay, nay.
[78:20.22]Okay, so... Is there something else here I can do?
[78:27.72]Wait, is there something?
[78:28.74]Can I crush it?
[78:39.90]No, no, no, no.
[78:40.40]Wait, okay, so do I just leave...
[78:44.44]Am I missing a very specific item that I need to kill this?
[78:53.88]Nay, nay, yeah, yeah.
[78:55.28]It's, yeah, I'm telling you that's, I picked up a gear.
[78:58.28]Alright, I'm out of here.
[79:17.32]OK, the judge by shrine.
[79:20.72]This game is pretty sick.
[79:40.10]I love Breath of the Wild.
[79:41.12]Cool, I hope I like it as much as you do.
[79:51.82]You should play Sonic Adventure.
[79:55.18]Didn't I already play Sonic Adventure on stream a long time ago?
[79:58.62]During Dreamcast Night?
[80:00.76]Or Dreamcast Week, whatever it was.
[80:02.33]Okay.
[80:08.77]Second Shrine.
[80:10.23]Yeah, I did.
[80:13.15]In the name of the goddess Hylia, I offer this trial.
[80:17.30]Bomb Trial.
[80:28.42]Alright, let's turn it on.
[80:36.15]Can you just make this the new Elden Ring where you play it every single stream?
[80:46.33]I don't know.
[80:46.73]We'll see.
[80:47.75]See if I like it.
[80:48.45]I have to enjoy it for a while.
[81:00.81]Whoa.
[81:04.98]Okay.
[81:06.20]The force of the blast can be used to damage monsters or destroy objects.
[81:09.22]I wonder what I do with that now.
[81:17.17]Okay.
[81:18.81]They're both round and cube bombs.
[81:21.03]We use whatever is better for the situation.
[81:22.87]Okay.
[81:24.33]So I go take that back outside and I just throw bombs at that thing and blow its head off.
[81:28.28]Got ya.
[81:44.14]So it's just a cooldown?
[81:45.14]There's no mana?
[81:45.76]Okay.
[81:58.02]Good.
[81:59.42]Just cooldown?
[81:59.97]Cool.
[82:00.15]Oh.
[82:06.55]Okay.
[82:07.73]I have to detonate them.
[82:10.79]Ooh.
[82:11.81]What's in here?
[82:15.68]That's pretty great.
[82:17.04]Alright.
[82:19.38]I'm never going to use that.
[82:20.30]Your inventory is full.
[82:22.33]What?
[82:45.17]I was getting rid of it.
[82:50.01]Damn, this thing's cool.
[82:50.96]Alright, put this away.
[82:52.68]I'm probably never going to equip this for the rest of the entire playthrough.
[82:58.24]I'm going to run into so many problems with this.
[83:01.18]This game system where things break.
[83:03.54]I will never use a good weapon until the last boss, and I'll cycle through five of them.
[83:19.79]Anything down here?
[83:20.35]This is too complicated, I quit.
[83:53.11]I can't climb this?
[83:56.42]No, I cannot climb smooth surfaces?
[84:01.42]Sound design in the game is really nice.
[84:04.20]It does sound really good.
[84:05.76]It is a very nice sound.
[84:06.96]Okay.
[85:40.90]I think I did it.
[85:47.20]Can I get launched from these?
[85:53.94]Okay, well, that's fun.
[86:00.46]I can, so hold on.
[86:01.24]I'm not going to do that.
[86:01.82]I want to get launched from that one.
[86:08.13]Yeah, I know.
[86:08.61]I'm getting the chest.
[86:11.91]I want to make sure they didn't kill you instantly or something.
[86:13.59]Just like you're dead.
[86:14.49]I was hoping it would... I was trying to time it.
[86:36.81]No!
[86:37.99]No!
[86:44.53]Amber.
[86:46.48]OK, cool.
[86:59.09]Now I take this and I probably put it into something over here, right?
[87:15.73]I guess not.
[87:23.46]Your resourcefulness in overcoming this trial speaks to the promise of a hero.
[87:27.30]In the name of Goddess Hylia, I bestow upon you the Spirit Orb.
[87:34.38]That wasn't not that hard.
[87:35.54]The fact that nobody has stumbled in here and done this simple pick the ball up puzzle
[87:45.32]This is a- this place is full of fucking idiots.
[87:47.94]I think no one's come down here and done that.
[87:53.47]Oh, the ancient trial where it's only the truest of heroes can pick a ball up and put it next to this thing to blow up.
[88:04.34]That's really not that hard.
[88:07.86]Uh, it wasn't activated until you touched the tower.
[88:10.22]You need the tablet.
[88:15.70]Alright, but why make it so easy for me, right?
[88:17.64]If, like, if... And you need the tablet to come in here.
[88:20.92]Shouldn't... Don't they want to have some barrier to make sure that the hero can actually do shit and not just have it be a simple pick-the-ball-up puzzle?
[88:28.37]If you want to make sure this guy's got what it takes, you put a... You... You... You put, like, a griffin in one of these.
[88:35.29]Then you'll find somebody that you can fucking really deal again.
[88:39.13]You put, like, a fucking hydra in one of these.
[88:42.53]and have it be a wall of Sudokus before you get to that point.
[88:47.18]You want the real hero?
[88:50.78]I'm talking a mural of Sudokus.
[88:53.34]Eventually someone might be able to do it.
[88:54.52]You know how many heroes would go down to the wall of Sudokus?
[89:05.13]There's like 5,000 Sudokus and just be like, I'm not gonna open this.
[89:08.61]I'm out of here.
[89:13.19]Is that working?
[89:25.94]Alright, well I did that one, so I should clear that.
[89:33.07]Is this hurting?
[89:40.37]I don't think it's hurt.
[89:45.07]Okay, let me get out of here.
[89:45.91]So I did that.
[89:46.47]That's good.
[89:49.00]Now let's head this way.
[89:50.22]Ooh.
[89:56.40]Give me this.
[89:59.90]Very cool.
[90:03.85]There's a Nintendo Switch shirt?
[90:10.80]He just pulled me out of the game so bad.
[90:13.70]I'm now out of the game.
[90:14.90]I'm going to like a Zelda convention now.
[90:18.14]This is no longer Breath of the Wild.
[90:19.38]What happened?
[90:23.24]He pulled me out.
[90:38.61]I'm a gamer now?
[90:42.74]Alright, I'm going up.
[90:43.50]Where?
[90:43.90]That way, probably?
[90:51.83]It's too bad there's not an emote where you can just be like... Probably something in these trees.
[91:15.63]Nothing?
[91:16.59]No, nothing.
[91:17.71]Flowers?
[91:18.27]Nothing.
[91:26.46]Which one's closer?
[91:27.26]This one or this one?
[91:29.44]Oh, this one by far is closer.
[91:31.19]How do I get up there?
[92:12.47]Yeah!
[92:30.98]Can't carry anymore.
[92:32.10]Where are the bees?
[92:33.00]Oh, shit.
[92:42.16]Give me the honey, quick!
[93:09.65]What's the aggro range?
[93:14.46]Okay, we're good.
[93:24.17]Alright, how do I get up there?
[93:26.14]Alright, well there's the old man.
[93:31.98]Is this a pear?
[93:43.73]Spicy pepper.
[93:44.63]Ooh.
[93:47.49]Old man's diary.
[93:49.74]This is kind of fucked up.
[93:50.72]Should I read this?
[93:57.40]Spicy meat and seafood fry.
[94:00.99]Not only restores health, but also keeps me warm even when traveling in the snowy mountains.
[94:04.55]Okay.
[94:08.03]Okay.
[94:12.31]Okay.
[95:05.54]Shield!
[95:18.64]You can pass time by a fire.
[95:19.96]Uh, let me talk to you.
[95:24.11]Ooh, fancy that.
[95:24.65]We meet again.
[95:25.15]This body of mine isn't what it used to be.
[95:28.09]Recovering from a bout of hard work takes a while.
[95:30.09]If you're hungry, I have an empty pot you can use to cook yourself a meal.
[95:35.44]Open your inventory, grab hold of your ingredients, and toss them in.
[95:39.09]Try to consider how the ingredients will complement one another.
[95:40.97]You can even make a dish that increases your stamina.
[95:42.85]Sick.
[95:54.89]Oh, food.
[95:55.67]Wait, how do you cook?
[96:03.75]You have to hold it?
[96:04.63]Hold.
[96:06.98]Hold?
[96:08.66]Hold, hold, hold.
[96:10.36]Oh, oh, oh, I see what you mean.
[96:11.70]Okay, what about like a mushroom?
[96:19.14]You want some cooked fucking poisonous mushrooms?
[96:27.59]And?
[96:27.81]Ooh.
[96:32.17]Oh shit, okay.
[96:34.84]What about a cooked acorn and fish souffle?
[96:42.99]Fish?
[96:43.43]Wait, hold on.
[96:44.83]Two fishes, an egg, and spicy peppers, and some fucking honey.
[96:51.65]How does that sound?
[96:52.35]That sounds like a pretty good batch to me.
[97:05.15]Glazed seafood, bro?
[97:19.32]How about some, uh, rubies for crunch?
[97:22.80]Uh, gear, a batwing, and, like, a fuckin' monster eye.
[97:26.93]Dude, did I a- what?
[97:38.15]Did I just actually make a special food?
[97:45.22]Go make grass and shit?
[97:46.38]Wait, you can cook grass?
[97:47.30]Alright, what about an egg?
[97:50.86]Egg, acorn, spicy pepper, and... this ancient screw.
[97:57.96]Wait, like... Why can I cook that?
[98:03.73]Alright, um...
[98:12.47]You can do that?
[98:14.99]That's so stupid.
[98:18.07]That wasn't an important item or anything, right?
[98:22.95]Was that actually... That was not, like, an important thing I need, is it?
[98:27.05]Eat it.
[98:32.94]No?
[98:33.26]Okay, good.
[98:33.84]Thank god.
[98:39.91]Okay, if they added a puke, this would be a full letter grade higher.
[98:43.91]If I came out of the menu and he just went, just green sludge came out of his mouth.
[98:48.95]Alright, well, that's cool.
[98:54.11]You can just make recipes.
[99:03.14]Really?
[99:03.38]Whoa.
[99:05.46]Whoa.
[99:11.52]Apple tree right here.
[99:12.36]Look at all these apples up here.
[99:26.63]I'm gonna make like an apple pie.
[99:30.00]The cooking part's my favorite thing.
[99:31.14]I don't want to cut this down.
[99:40.40]Is there a seed?
[99:42.60]I actually did not really want to cut that down.
[99:53.13]What if I did apple and wood?
[99:54.47]You know, for crunch.
[100:10.73]How much wood should I get?
[100:20.30]I feel like I should do this now, so I don't do this later.
[100:22.58]Leaf, leaf, leaf, leaf, leaf, leaf.
[100:28.03]I mean leaf.
[100:30.49]Leaf, leaf, leaf.
[100:33.59]Oh.
[100:40.73]God damn it.
[100:45.68]Um...
[100:57.31]Whoa.
[100:57.55]Alright.
[100:58.03]I don't want to use that.
[101:28.51]Spicy apple mushroom pie?
[101:34.81]Ooh, grants low-level cold resistance.
[101:36.97]The sweet dish is made by heaping tasty fruits into a pan and simmering until tender.
[101:43.60]I get four and a half minutes of cold resist?
[101:48.54]That is by far the most fun part of the game so far.
[101:53.28]Without a doubt, that's awesome.
[101:54.26]That's really fun to do.
[101:56.42]The fact you can make your own recipes.
[102:00.67]But that's death.
[102:03.76]Okay, so how do I get across here?
[102:07.94]Good question.
[102:18.31]Up there and then left?
[102:21.79]Tree, tree, tree.
[102:33.94]Climb the tree.
[102:35.38]Or knock the tree down.
[102:36.46]Did you actually climb this whole thing?
[102:54.44]I'm mainly curious about that.
[103:06.56]Can you get to the top?
[103:13.06]Can I go up and put my legs up like Spider-Man?
[103:16.98]Okay.
[103:28.17]I made it.
[103:28.65]Okay, so...
[103:39.21]Nope.
[103:42.33]You cannot get there from that.
[103:43.79]You, uh, you probably just chop it down.
[103:47.11]What was it you hold?
[103:53.21]Oh, right.
[103:57.24]That didn't work either.
[104:03.38]What the fuck?
[104:04.76]What?
[104:06.28]That didn't work.
[104:11.89]Cut the other one.
[104:20.56]You guys are fucking with me.
[105:10.71]Fuck off.
[105:19.64]How do I- What's the- It's holding- What button do you hold to- I don't know.
[105:25.32]It's hold- Hold this shit!
[105:26.54]Hold that shit!
[105:37.06]Hold right?
[105:37.64]Okay, it's hold right.
[105:47.37]What's this?
[105:47.87]Ooh, a spear.
[105:51.18]Explain- I know, it's like, hold right, and then press the right stick, and then let go, and I- I- I know, I know.
[105:55.68]It's contextual press- hold button key mapping.
[105:58.83]Where's my food?
[106:25.15]Boomer reflexes.
[106:26.23]There's way more than four buttons in this, you know how I feel about it.
[106:29.79]Okay, can I climb up here?
[106:37.24]I might be able to climb this.
[106:55.96]This scared the fuck out of me.
[106:57.02]Alright.
[106:58.18]Um.
[106:59.60]I don't think I can climb that.
[107:03.06]I'm good.
[107:06.14]I want to get all these apples though.
[107:09.59]Emote only.
[107:10.35]Yeah.
[107:10.75]The emote only makes it so I can't see.
[107:14.99]All the backseaters.
[107:20.75]Just give me the fuck.
[107:21.67]I want all the apples.
[107:22.36]Give them.
[107:22.84]I want them.
[107:23.58]Give them to me.
[107:30.95]Too lazy to climb to the right spot, so just cut the whole tree down.
[107:37.90]Okay, so then over here.
[107:38.80]Ah, I can climb that.
[107:43.52]Okay.
[107:50.51]Okay.
[108:00.73]Ooh, there's purple mushrooms over here.
[108:05.69]What are these?
[108:09.22]A mushroom that can almost grow anywhere.
[108:13.70]Cook it before eating to temporarily increase your movement speed.
[108:17.80]Okay.
[108:37.67]A lot of rush rooms over here.
[108:39.25]I'll check this out.
[108:41.93]That's why I just blew up my face.
[108:49.00]Oh my god, dude.
[108:49.68]This is gonna be fucking awesome.
[108:50.88]Check this out.
[108:57.07]I'm gonna hit this person in the fucking head.
[109:09.45]Oh, there's no arrows, whatever.
[109:12.94]Can you craft arrows?
[109:19.70]Top left for bow?
[109:23.88]Oh shit, don't jump again.
[109:24.88]Uh oh.
[109:34.28]Close.
[109:39.19]Alright, this is over here, and... Okay, I gotta go to the right here.
[109:42.95]The hell is that?
[109:57.31]Am I gonna put- is somebody gonna throw a rock over here?
[109:59.17]No one's gonna come step on my fingers when I get to the top?
[110:23.23]I think I'm good.
[110:29.86]Something died up here.
[110:30.74]Alright.
[110:31.62]Owa Dayum Shrine.
[110:36.32]Let's do it.
[110:37.74]This game's sick.
[110:58.99]He's doing it?
[110:59.51]I mean, I'm playing it.
[111:05.04]I bet you he's never going to play this again.
[111:09.76]Don't be so sure.
[111:10.74]To who sets foot in this shrine, I am Owadiam.
[111:19.20]In the name of the goddess Hylia, I offer you this trial.
[111:35.49]Stealing rune.
[111:38.53]What if I just leaned over and opened my mouth and caught that in my mouth?
[111:45.51]Would that ruin everything?
[111:49.17]Would I have blue diarrhea for a year?
[111:59.51]Stop the flow of time for an object.
[112:03.42]I'm out of the loop.
[112:03.88]Is this your first playthrough?
[112:05.07]I've never played this.
[112:05.95]This is my first Zelda game in 15 years.
[112:10.15]It's got to be 15 to 17, 18.
[112:15.69]When did Majora's Mask come out in Ocarina of Time?
[112:18.11]That was like 1996.
[112:23.27]We're talking about 17 years.
[112:28.15]It's been a long fucking time.
[112:30.70]Okay, so it's time stopped.
[112:40.03]How long ago was it?
[112:44.79]Majora's Mask was 22 years ago?
[112:47.32]Oh my god.
[112:50.90]Alright, so obviously we're going to go like this.
[112:52.32]Wait.
[112:57.94]How long is it?
[113:01.46]I'm trying to... Whatever.
[113:02.54]I'm... I'm holding jump to grab.
[113:07.22]But that's not how you do it.
[113:07.98]It's not hold jump, grab.
[113:09.51]It's hold jump and you have to hold X. There's like a grab button you have to press.
[113:48.11]Chest or anything?
[113:53.81]You should name your horse Shitstan.
[113:56.27]So there's a horse in the game.
[113:58.42]I didn't know that until you just said it.
[114:00.40]That looks cool.
[114:02.36]Iron sledgehammer.
[114:06.38]Oh my fucking god.
[114:07.44]I don't know, what did I just drop?
[114:12.43]What did I just drop?
[114:15.22]Alright, throw this thing away.
[114:17.44]Wait, let me see what the moveset is like.
[114:18.70]This thing's awesome.
[114:23.75]I don't have room for it.
[114:25.57]Torch?
[114:26.05]Should I hold onto the torch?
[114:34.80]Okay.
[114:37.68]I want that.
[114:49.97]Yep.
[114:56.73]Sledgehammers are very important.
[114:58.87]You'll want one at all times.
[115:01.14]Okay.
[115:14.46]It reminds me of the WarioWare.
[115:15.70]The...
[115:27.88]They're like dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[115:32.02]Can I move it?
[115:35.76]Uh, will the, will this work?
[116:06.32]What?
[116:07.96]Why would that work?
[116:08.64]Spirit orb.
[116:50.83]Three spirit orbs.
[116:53.27]Okay.
[116:53.87]I got one more tutorial shrine to do.
[116:57.21]Cool.
[117:11.46]Go back and read the tutorials.
[117:16.27]If I need to, I will.
[117:18.91]Alright.
[117:19.91]There's only one remaining and it's up there.
[117:21.61]The temperature is getting dangerously low.
[117:42.79]Find a find warmth.
[117:52.05]how many how many clothes that guy that's gonna help this he's shrunk the temperature the temperature when it reaches a certain level
[118:19.98]Well, how do I get the fuck out of here?
[118:21.50]Where's the hot spot?
[118:25.94]Come on.
[118:26.42]Okay.
[118:46.09]So, it's too cold.
[118:46.97]Wait, I have food.
[118:51.16]Okay, grants low-level cold resistance.
[118:52.78]This sweet dish is made of... Okay, so I got four and a half minutes.
[118:56.92]If I eat this, then I have about five minutes to walk around, right?
[119:02.76]Let's go for it.
[119:03.94]I'll try to get there as quick as possible.
[119:17.07]So if I eat it, not yet.
[119:18.37]Wait till I get to the temperature drop.
[119:22.13]Okay, temperature dropped.
[119:22.91]Okay, eat the food here.
[119:25.70]Eat it.
[119:30.16]Cold resistance.
[119:31.36]Let's go.
[119:41.10]I apparently got lost going to the Nintendo convention.
[119:45.83]How did I end up here?
[119:47.81]Oh shit, do I have a bow?
[120:08.78]Okay, I got it.
[120:10.06]I did it.
[120:10.36]I'm fine.
[120:13.76]What was even over here?
[120:14.50]There's nothing even here.
[120:21.28]Oh wait, chest.
[120:32.82]Come on, is it like a comfy hoodie?
[120:34.90]Alright, hurry up, come on.
[121:06.12]Boko shield?
[121:10.89]Whoa, cool.
[121:11.53]Alright.
[121:11.99]I can't carry any more items.
[121:17.72]Three minutes on the cold resist.
[121:22.03]Five arrows.
[121:23.25]Come on, give me some gear.
[121:37.31]Green rupee?
[121:41.76]Oh shit, okay, can I climb?
[121:43.04]Okay, climb this?
[121:48.46]Can I make it over to- wait, I have an idea.
[122:00.61]No no no no no no no no no no!
[122:13.93]I can't just sit up there?
[122:19.83]Fucking God, just get up there.
[122:21.77]I can't stand on this?
[122:23.82]Looks like I can.
[122:24.46]Alright, let's go.
[122:29.82]Alright, I made it.
[122:45.70]Okay.
[122:46.04]It's right over there.
[122:50.63]I think.
[122:56.05]Is this freezing?
[122:56.61]How cold is this water?
[122:57.55]Okay.
[123:06.22]Well, we're going a different way.
[123:19.40]Why do you only have three health?
[123:24.76]I don't know.
[123:25.70]Because I just started the game?
[123:28.53]It looks like there's a bridge or something right here.
[123:30.73]What is this line on the map?
[123:36.71]See this?
[123:37.33]What is this?
[123:37.77]Oh, that's the waterfall edge.
[123:40.25]Um, shit.
[123:41.42]What do I do?
[123:51.33]I have one minute.
[123:54.73]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[123:55.35]Wait, wait, wait.
[123:55.65]I think I can... Can I get up like this?
[124:06.83]I got one minute.
[124:42.06]Wait!
[124:42.30]Mushrooms!
[124:42.74]How do I cook?
[124:45.36]How do I cook food?
[124:48.90]Oh my god, I got... There's no way.
[124:54.33]I can eat my way there, though.
[124:55.27]Am I good?
[125:11.84]I can eat my way here.
[125:12.60]Are you kidding me guys?
[125:48.63]Why do I not have a weapon equipped?
[125:52.47]I gotta make quick work of this.
[126:03.07]Oh, look.
[126:03.59]Look at my temperature.
[126:06.35]My temperature's good.
[126:12.77]Take what?
[126:14.47]Oh, it's take that.
[126:15.53]Oh my god, take arrows?
[126:18.19]Yep.
[126:20.12]Is this food or anything?
[126:22.56]It is.
[126:23.04]Very cool.
[126:23.62]Alright.
[126:24.78]Should I cook?
[126:26.07]Alright.
[126:32.03]Two apples.
[126:34.06]One mushroom.
[126:35.28]One rush room.
[126:37.24]And a acorn.
[127:02.10]Toasty rush room roast.
[127:04.76]Oh, it's not I just toasted everything Alright, well, I didn't know I thought you could cook Alright, wait wait wait wait wait if I light up this The temperature okay, I'm good.
[127:25.04]I get it.
[127:25.64]No don't do that.
[127:27.06]Oh
[127:51.89]No, I can't get it.
[127:52.69]Alright, hurry up, get in here.
[127:54.01]Is it warm in here?
[127:54.64]This has got to be insulated in here, right?
[128:22.92]I would imagine it's probably insulated.
[128:24.08]The temperature is... Yeah, it's insulated.
[128:51.31]Insulated.
[128:58.28]Cool.
[129:15.89]And it is not the oh wait.
[129:18.75]Pillar of ice from a water surface.
[129:21.11]Builds ice pillars that are very stable.
[129:22.61]These pillars can be used as stepping stones or as obstacles.
[129:27.52]Use Cryonis on an ice pillar to break it.
[129:33.16]That's a cool ability.
[129:34.24]Let's try it.
[129:47.76]Cool.
[129:48.78]So these, how long do they last?
[129:49.84]Can you only have one?
[129:55.79]Okay, you can have more than one.
[129:56.71]I love that sound.
[130:00.47]I love ice.
[130:08.70]You know what's one of my favorite things in the world?
[130:11.86]When you get an ice tray... So I like to make my own ice.
[130:15.75]And the thick... It takes like a whole day to freeze this in the freezer.
[130:22.41]But when you get those huge... They're at least two inches tall and two inches wide almost.
[130:29.52]They're these big... Completely see-through...
[130:34.18]Thick ice chunks.
[130:36.04]I love just sitting that in a cup and just putting, I don't know, like, an iced tea in there.
[130:40.90]Or like a Coca-Cola or something.
[130:43.35]Ugh.
[131:09.24]How high can I make this?
[131:10.10]Is that as high as it goes?
[131:36.59]Can't go higher than that?
[132:27.90]Fuck, I just got hurt.
[132:29.90]The eyes hurt my chest.
[132:32.25]I'm just thinking about somebody looking at the security cam.
[132:36.31]This guy fucking dies right there.
[132:40.09]Ah, that hurt.
[132:45.21]Ooh.
[132:47.17]I'm alright.
[132:50.52]I'm just thinking somebody's looking at the security monitors and... Oh, hey, somebody made it!
[132:54.07]Somebody got in!
[132:54.61]Yeah, yeah, yeah, another adventurer!
[132:56.67]I wonder... Yeah, let's give him the ice move!
[133:01.19]And the guy throws a bomb against the wall and bounces off and fucking blows the guy to smithereens.
[133:08.43]No!
[133:08.85]That one didn't make it.
[133:10.40]Wait another 5,000 years for the next one.
[133:18.38]Oh, okay.
[133:24.38]I just laughed too quickly and I like popped a joint in my rib.
[133:28.01]God damn it.
[133:33.18]Okay, so how do I get out of here?
[134:20.27]I can't even make it past the first door.
[134:27.43]This is why you have a team.
[134:28.37]This is what a team is for.
[134:34.94]Guys, the Wizard of Oz told us a long, long time ago, you get the guy that knows how to do the puzzles, the guy that can dodge the axe, and that can kill things with melee weapons, the strong one, the smart one, the... the... the courageous one, right, we all can do something.
[134:52.69]We let the smart one do the puzzles, and then I get in there with the fucking axe,
[134:57.35]And start swinging!
[134:58.35]That's the whole- that we've learned this a hundred years ago.
[135:00.68]This is why you need a team.
[135:06.86]Let the smart person figure this out while I smoke a cigarette over there in the corner.
[135:14.15]How do I get out of here?
[135:15.17]How do I do this?
[135:30.83]Stop time!
[135:31.39]Alright, I stopped time on that.
[135:47.08]This thing is made out of fucking metal.
[135:50.24]What?! !
[136:10.10]Okay, I did it.
[136:17.93]Who wants turkey?
[136:53.88]I gotta have my song.
[136:56.39]Well, of course, Dorothy.
[136:57.45]Well, what can you do?
[136:59.11]Well, I can dodge your necks with a swift kick.
[137:03.91]Fall backwards and smoke a cigarette.
[137:07.70]Consulting with the rain.
[137:33.22]Oh, this thing's made out of metal.
[137:34.04]We're good.
[137:39.75]Hold on, this is technically... Wait, this is water.
[137:48.81]Oh my god, look what you can do!
[137:50.61]Physics!
[137:55.83]physics physics get up there if I don't make this again I'm gonna be very upset okay it's what's going on go up I'm getting caught on the
[138:30.09]On there.
[138:31.21]Okay.
[138:42.60]Oh, hold on.
[139:13.07]A spear.
[139:17.33]Oh, Monka, cool!
[139:18.35]I think that's it, right?
[139:37.77]Yeah, okay.
[139:51.90]Never before seen solutions.
[139:53.90]What does that mean?
[139:56.12]Alright, you're resourcefulness.
[139:57.16]You're very resourceful.
[139:58.64]In the name of the goddess Hylia, I bestow upon you this orb.
[140:02.34]Cool.
[140:30.31]My fucking chest.
[140:32.37]Why did I have to think about the stupid security footage of somebody dying in this dungeon?
[140:36.74]Hey, I got them all!
[140:47.22]Where's my glider?
[140:55.65]Extraordinary.
[141:01.37]Link, it is finally time for me to tell you everything.
[141:04.33]But first, sign this non-disclosure agreement so you can't tell anybody about it.
[141:09.82]It's between me and you.
[141:19.90]I didn't read that.
[141:25.19]Where the two lines connecting the shrines would cross, there I'll be waiting.
[141:28.89]There are four shrines.
[141:36.15]Centered amid the four shrines.
[141:37.95]One.
[141:38.49]Two.
[141:38.57]Three.
[141:38.69]Four.
[141:38.87]Right about here.
[141:43.11]Okay.
[141:55.25]Why is that not on the map?
[141:59.09]Has to be a pin, not a stamp.
[142:23.80]Oh.
[142:38.88]You bet your ass I can dodge it.
[142:42.71]Every weapon held in two hands if you only swung an axe.
[142:50.29]Yeah, I talk about in that movie how I can dodge everything.
[142:54.03]And then I just get an arrow like through the temple.
[142:59.10]It just goes like... Can't dodge that.
[143:06.84]Okay.
[143:12.86]So you said it was a stamp, not a marker.
[143:20.50]So then... Yeah, it's this.
[143:23.88]So make a pen.
[143:25.36]There we go.
[143:32.39]Badly damaged.
[143:34.85]Who needs it?
[143:43.85]Okay, so it's right there.
[143:47.44]You needed to use the ice pillar to lift the gate.
[143:52.58]Man.
[143:54.10]We can play the game two different ways.
[144:03.90]It's a little chilly out though.
[144:15.41]Hmm.
[144:23.76]A sword and stone?
[144:24.72]Can I climb in?
[144:30.58]Hold on.
[144:46.23]rusty broadsword that does not you do that does not constitute putting that into a stone like that that's not that interesting
[145:20.97]An opal.
[145:28.81]Not bad.
[145:31.09]Not a bad find.
[145:55.48]Ooh, lots of fangs.
[145:58.58]Okay, I'm here.
[146:00.60]He's having fun.
[146:01.74]No, this is good.
[146:04.18]It's just one of those games where there's tons of stuff just to look at and do and play with and find.
[146:10.41]And look, a treasure chest with a tooth in it.
[146:12.89]Right, I like that stuff.
[146:24.75]Ancient screw?
[146:25.39]Where's that guy?
[146:31.60]This is definitely it.
[146:37.88]This is definitely it.
[146:40.22]Where is he?
[146:46.50]Up top?
[146:53.55]When does Breath of the Wild 2 come out?
[147:10.80]May?
[147:13.60]May 12th.
[147:14.30]Alright.
[147:14.72]Looking forward to it.
[147:31.89]Another ancient gear.
[147:32.77]Assuming they don't delay it.
[147:36.05]Oh, that's true.
[147:37.88]It could get delayed, couldn't it?
[147:44.10]Could.
[147:44.34]Another ancient shaft.
[147:51.28]I kind of want to go up there.
[148:05.01]Wait.
[148:10.29]Rupees?
[148:12.86]No rupees.
[148:16.64]Not a single rupee.
[148:20.52]Bullshit.
[148:26.40]He's pretending to be excited.
[148:30.23]The Nintendo fans are gonna kill me.
[148:33.15]Stop, shh, quiet.
[148:35.68]What are you trying to do?
[148:38.48]Let's go!
[148:40.88]Traveler's bow.
[148:41.58]Oh, I need a bow.
[148:46.44]Okay, I don't actually need that.
[148:50.98]I have, like, five of these.
[148:52.28]Alright, here.
[148:54.69]Can I throw the bow?
[148:55.63]How do I throw the bow?
[149:03.83]Just drop it.
[149:22.31]Okay, so I've got the turkey leg and the traveler's shield is fine.
[149:28.56]And then... Is there a fast way to switch the bow?
[149:37.20]Yeah, it's hold this and go like that.
[149:38.82]Alright, so I definitely don't want... Yeah, I just want the Boku, the Boko bow, whatever it is.
[149:53.65]Am I supposed to do this?
[149:57.41]The Boku bow.
[150:01.77]Wasn't Boku a adult juice box?
[150:05.48]Do you guys remember that?
[150:07.32]It was a company that tried to make an adult juice box.
[150:15.72]It was supposed to be, it's not for kids, it's for adults.
[150:23.59]I want one.
[150:24.75]Hold on.
[150:25.81]Yeah, I'm telling you, this is real.
[150:33.30]Yeah, back in the 90s.
[150:33.88]Yeah, Boku.
[150:34.18]It was a juice box for adults.
[150:55.13]Wait, Richard Lewis is in this commercial?
[150:57.57]I can't hear this, but I don't know what he's saying.
[151:04.16]No, it's not alcohol.
[151:04.62]No, it was just a juice box.
[151:05.58]This is Richard Lewis.
[151:06.42]I've had it.
[151:24.35]What do you mean TOS?
[151:25.03]What are you talking about?
[151:27.77]Show this?
[151:28.53]I can't hear it, but I can show it.
[151:31.31]Because my headphones are plugged into the... You'll be able to hear the switch.
[151:35.33]Here, hold on.
[151:36.07]I'll let you guys watch it.
[151:37.03]That's fine.
[151:43.02]So I go to a...
[152:04.18]I don't know what he's saying.
[152:05.08]Is he saying this is an adult juice box?
[152:06.62]I'm bringing my own Boku.
[152:29.44]Boku fruit juice cooler from McCain.
[152:31.56]Why did he have a belt of them?
[152:36.32]This is stupid.
[152:37.16]What did he say?
[152:37.96]Is it funny?
[152:42.98]He sounds like you doing a voice.
[152:52.47]Yeah, it was an adult juice box.
[152:56.81]Okay, well, let's play.
[152:59.96]You who have conquered the shrines and claimed their spirit orbs.
[153:04.30]I can offer you... I don't... I can't dub it.
[153:05.78]I don't know what he's saying.
[153:08.62]It sounds like he's mocking the drink.
[153:17.98]Oh, he said he's bringing them to a party.
[153:20.84]Okay.
[153:21.82]It appears you have four spirit orbs.
[153:23.32]In exchange, I will amplify your being.
[153:28.47]Oh...
[153:30.85]This is important.
[153:31.51]You guys, adult juice boxes already exist.
[153:42.63]It's called just going and getting orange juice from the grocery store.
[153:48.26]That's a pretty adult beverage, I would say.
[153:50.60]Just orange juice.
[153:51.40]Like, you can be an adult and drink it.
[153:55.22]Uh, I think I want the stamina.
[153:59.52]Do heart.
[154:00.88]I want stamina, though.
[154:01.56]I want to be able to move around more and climb more.
[154:04.54]I'm doing stamina.
[154:10.49]Stamina, to me, is more important.
[154:13.09]Just don't get hit.
[154:15.59]All the people saying heart container, just get good.
[154:18.85]Just don't get hit.
[154:19.43]Give me a break.
[154:22.95]Cool.
[154:23.33]Alright.
[154:24.45]Very cool.
[154:24.95]Ooh!
[154:25.55]I get an extra little thing there?
[154:35.35]Give me the glider.
[154:35.85]Is my FPS on this camera fine?
[154:43.30]Yeah.
[154:46.08]The blessing of the goddess has made you much more resilient, I see.
[154:50.12]Here I am.
[154:50.50]Get up here quickly.
[155:11.60]You know that never happened in TF2?
[155:13.62]I always tried to get it, but it never happened.
[155:16.54]Coming out of a map, or coming out of the spawn, and just... knocking a Huntsman arrow across the whole map.
[155:22.06]And just waiting to hear that... I tried it probably 10,000 to 20,000 different times.
[155:31.65]It's just so hard to do.
[155:41.91]By the way, if there's not a single way I'm ever going to play a different Zelda game than this, because I find this to be... a hundred times cooler than any of the Zelda games I've ever played.
[155:53.98]He talks.
[156:05.40]Or my shortened name, Ganondorf.
[156:24.76]Oh, is this the dinner guy?
[157:03.57]Somebody said, why does he sound hot?
[157:09.00]What the fuck.
[157:52.57]I'm going to Gamelon.
[157:56.77]Protect me.
[157:57.25]Fuck you, Link.
[158:02.25]I will eat you for dinner.
[158:03.59]Fuck you, the king.
[158:05.61]Fuck you, Ganon.
[158:45.05]They always, if they wanted to do something that they never said, stringing together like six different consonants.
[158:52.07]Right?
[158:52.87]So if, oh, I'm going to Gamelon, to- eh- P-E-E-NIS.
[158:56.74]It's like, P-E-N-I-S.
[159:23.60]Sentence mixing.
[159:25.18]It's so funny.
[159:42.05]It's so great when it doesn't work at all, but you know what they were trying to do.
[159:47.35]I definitely have seen videos of the spy from TF2 saying like... S-uck- my- D-E-ICK. 
[160:05.00]Like, okay, I... alright, I know what you were doing.
[159:08.00]I know what you were trying... whatever.
[160:40.91]Yeah, if you're like, I-Ea-T- My- Eh-S-Ope.
[161:04.35]This shirt, yeah, this does... this does not seem right.
[161:12.53]In a Switch game.
[161:40.13]Does it really- why do I have to be in my Link costume?
[161:44.87]I'm still Link.
[161:45.55]Does it matter?
[161:46.07]Who cares?
[161:46.57]Link could just put on a green shirt.
[161:53.14]Who cares?
[161:53.84]What's the difference?
[162:59.43]Thanks for the paraglider.
[163:04.26]Yay!
[163:04.76]Okay.
[163:09.08]Press B while you're in the air to use it.
[163:19.12]Fly off cliffs.
[163:22.56]And I think that's it.
[163:25.10]And I think that's it.
[163:29.17]Link, you must save Hyrule.
[163:32.11]Is he ever coming back?
[163:41.50]Seek out Impa.
[163:45.96]Okay, so now I can jump.
[163:59.34]I want to pan over and have his mouth just be open like wide like the air filling it.
[164:12.51]That would be so funny.
[164:23.37]You can use it pretty much anywhere.
[164:24.89]Wait, hold on.
[164:26.65]Can I kill this thing now?
[164:30.12]So I have... Stasis.
[164:33.98]Let's try this.
[164:34.46]Here we go.
[164:46.23]Bombs, maybe?
[164:46.79]Can I block this?
[164:55.11]Broke my shield.
[164:55.75]Actually, blew my shield up.
[164:57.03]Never mind.
[164:58.61]Alright, I'm getting the fuck out of here.
[165:15.56]Alright, I want you in the chat to everyone to tell me why Zelda is, why you like Zelda games.
[165:21.38]Why do you like a Zelda game?
[165:22.64]And I want it in four words.
[165:31.80]I love adventure games.
[165:32.70]Okay, cool.
[165:34.64]Is sword go slash?
[165:35.88]They're kind of fun.
[165:39.92]None of your business.
[165:40.86]Fair.
[165:41.16]That's four words.
[165:45.03]I like dungeon crawling.
[165:46.29]Cool.
[165:46.77]Very good.
[165:49.53]I save the princess.
[165:50.57]Okay.
[165:50.81]Fun dungeons and adventure.
[165:53.45]Alright, I get it.
[165:55.70]Music is usually good.
[165:57.08]Yep.
[165:59.00]Only played this one.
[166:00.00]Fuck you, that's why.
[166:04.60]Yeah, that's fair.
[166:14.69]Excuse me?
[166:15.13]Why is this thing coming alive?
[166:20.41]Stone talus?
[166:24.45]I'm fucking dead.
[166:26.35]What?
[166:26.59]There's no dodge.
[166:27.45]I'm trying to do the... I just want to do that.
[166:31.35]All I want is my whole body to lunge sideways in a flip.
[166:34.93]Just like... Why can't I do that?
[166:47.51]Alright, let's do it again.
[166:55.91]X teleportation rumors.
[167:05.83]Oh, I blew his leg off.
[167:08.63]Okay, hold on.
[167:14.08]Nice drop throwing it the wrong direction.
[167:20.64]Stop texting me rumors.
[167:21.92]I don't care.
[167:22.48]Oh, my God.
[167:28.11]Stop texting me.
[167:28.99]Oh, my God.
[167:41.76]Stop texting me about stuff!
[167:43.75]I don't want to see that!
[167:45.61]Stop!
[167:46.59]Xenoblade Chronicles 2?!
[167:47.91]Stop with these advertisement texts!
[167:51.68]What are you talking about?
[168:16.08]Every Zelda boss has a puzzle you have to blow off his leg.
[168:19.63]And then you have to go inside of his bone marrow and hit him in the bone marrow.
[169:05.88]Alright, now what do I do?
[169:06.72]Do I hit him with the butt-tail thing?
[169:09.55]I'm just holding onto his ass!
[169:13.65]I have to smash this thing, right?
[169:45.69]Why are you crouching?
[170:38.88]I'll get him.
[170:39.44]I'll get him.
[170:39.90]I'm going to use a different weapon too.
[170:41.24]Something better.
[170:42.14]It's time to actually use one of these good items.
[170:47.39]I'm using this Traveler's Claymore and I'm going to fuck him up.
[171:14.59]Nice hit!
[171:55.91]I have to just throw the bomb at the diamond in his back.
[172:02.53]Mallet, mallet.
[172:03.37]Smash the mallet.
[172:04.47]I don't know what you mean.
[172:05.77]Cartoon bullshit.
[172:07.44]Use this?
[172:08.56]Okay, I'm gonna use this.
[172:09.56]Thanks for the help.
[172:16.48]I'm on his head.
[172:19.28]I didn't want to jump.
[172:29.32]What are you talking about?
[172:30.88]Why did I think that was Sprint?
[172:34.41]I'm so fucking confused.
[172:36.01]Why did that happen?
[173:01.78]Alright, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[173:02.86]I'm gonna go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[173:04.38]He's gonna smash his head.
[173:09.44]Hmm.
[173:49.80]Okay.
[173:50.80]Do I just- can I- Stop doing the mallet emote.
[173:54.93]I don't know what that means.
[173:55.91]Can I stop time?
[174:30.40]Oh!
[174:30.74]Wait, it broke?
[174:31.90]What?
[174:32.14]I thought I... I get it back, right?
[174:34.10]Because I died?
[174:34.54]I get it back because I died, right?
[174:38.00]Okay, good.
[174:44.61]Good, good, good, good, good.
[174:51.61]Thank God.
[174:52.03]Okay, I... Maybe I'm just not strong enough.
[174:55.53]I might just not be strong enough to do this.
[174:59.74]I don't think I'm strong enough to beat this guy.
[175:12.59]You piece of shit!
[175:24.72]Okay, I'm not strong enough.
[175:30.93]But I want to beat it so bad.
[175:37.27]One more try.
[175:52.11]I'm taking both arms out.
[175:53.55]I'm gonna be very patient.
[175:54.51]Here we go.
[175:55.09]Patient time.
[175:59.13]There's both arms done.
[176:01.20]He's gonna smash his head.
[176:02.12]I'm gonna climb up his body.
[176:05.22]And I'm gonna get the- No, he grows the shit back!
[176:24.84]I completely missed.
[176:57.83]Hey!
[177:32.37]Hey!
[177:32.55]Put the fucking phone down!
[178:31.84]Can I shoot with arrows?
[178:43.43]Yes!
[178:52.79]That does not do any damage at all though.
[179:03.10]I'm not strong enough to be here.
[179:08.32]I actually don't think I'm strong enough to be here.
[179:11.52]I think you come back in like 10 levels.
[179:19.74]You come back in 10 plus levels.
[179:28.23]Just give up on the Tree Sentinel.
[179:29.57]Not yet.
[179:30.08]I will.
[179:30.80]Okay, I'm gonna get it here.
[179:32.34]I'm just gonna play.
[179:33.64]I'm gonna dodge and fight.
[179:44.80]How does that?
[179:45.87]I'm done.
[179:46.93]I'm fucking done.
[179:47.67]I'm leaving.
[179:48.23]I'm- I'm- okay.
[179:49.17]I'm alive.
[179:49.47]I'm alive.
[179:49.71]I'm fine.
[179:49.91]I'm good.
[179:51.91]Goodbye.
[179:52.23]I'm done.
[179:52.65]I'm coming back later.
[179:53.31]I'm not supposed to be here.
[179:54.27]This is like something you do like in 10 levels or like 20 levels.
[179:58.07]You do this thing- this is like a late game fight.
[180:10.56]It's a late game fight.
[180:16.00]I don't think I can freeze him in time, can I?
[180:17.58]Can I freeze his body?
[180:22.05]I got chapstick all over the controller.
[180:30.71]No, I can't freeze him.
[180:31.67]Stop time.
[180:48.06]What is going on?
[180:49.52]Get out of here.
[180:50.26]No, I'm just going to fight him.
[181:03.68]I think I'm safe here.
[181:05.20]Let me... Hold on.
[181:06.30]Okay.
[181:08.73]So.
[181:25.20]What happened?
[181:25.90]Um.
[181:29.00]That was such over dramatic bullshit Link, please.
[181:31.00]You could have gotten up five times.
[181:36.50]There's no referee to give anybody a red card here, please, enough.
[182:16.84]I got a fucking idea.
[182:17.72]How's this for an idea?
[182:24.00]Watch this.
[182:28.85]Eat shit.
[182:40.70]That's the play, and I just gotta get off.
[183:29.66]I'm just not doing enough damage.
[183:32.10]Look at his health.
[183:32.64]I can't do it.
[183:46.58]What about the bow?
[183:47.40]Dude, the bow does just as little fucking damage.
[183:52.00]The bow does less damage than that.
[183:54.23]I'm supposed to come back here after this.
[183:57.09]I'm not supposed to be here.
[184:00.37]Use the bow.
[184:01.47]Use the hammer.
[184:02.07]I need better weapons.
[184:06.59]Dude, stun him with arrows.
[184:08.37]Alright, you got no arms now.
[184:31.17]Okay, here we go.
[184:35.60]Now he's gonna... What?
[185:07.79]Dude, some fucking stun that is.
[185:16.40]That stun is not even one second.
[185:34.27]Walk on.
[185:51.69]That shit don't last long enough.
[186:09.96]When does this motherfucker go down?
[186:39.02]I can't beat him.
[186:40.02]I don't have explosive arrows.
[186:55.36]No, I can't kill him.
[186:57.12]That's not true.
[186:57.88]Yeah, it is.
[186:58.56]What am I supposed to do?
[186:59.78]Look.
[187:02.87]This rock piece of shit.
[187:04.17]I can't.
[187:05.21]No.
[187:18.86]That was not nice.
[187:30.68]I have to get some type of item to blow the back of that thing off.
[187:35.94]I die in one hit.
[187:36.96]I'm not supposed to be here.
[187:47.25]Okay.
[187:57.75]Okay.
[188:00.18]What is this?
[188:00.64]Ooh, hold on.
[188:13.59]I'm disappointed in you?
[188:18.97]Disappointed because I don't have the thing, I don't have the game knowledge to beat the gimmick boss where you have to blow his leg off and fucking bite his bone marrow to do damage?
[188:57.42]Bro, chill with the chapstick.
[188:58.88]I'm fine.
[189:09.56]Lost a bone marrow.
[189:10.60]I'm telling you, I'm going to come back there and it's going to be like, dude, you could have killed him.
[189:15.04]You could have killed him.
[189:16.00]Yeah.
[189:16.86]Just like you can kill the... What's it called?
[189:21.14]The sentry in the beginning of Elden Ring.
[189:23.42]Yeah, you can.
[189:26.44]No, you can't.
[189:27.28]You're not supposed to.
[189:27.98]Alright, so let's go.
[189:30.38]We get a new shrine?
[189:45.83]How do I get the wind?
[190:10.79]Hmm.
[190:50.83]Can I hit to go faster?
[190:51.71]I can't, um... Oh!
[191:04.88]Okay.
[191:07.96]Amber.
[191:08.30]I better see at least 100 PogChamps over there, because I figured it out.
[191:29.71]Okay.
[191:33.03]What about this one over here?
[191:34.93]What's this for?
[191:40.30]Just to get back.
[191:46.92]Okay, what about down here?
[191:50.27]By the way, thanks for joining me for Omega Gaming Weekend.
[192:18.65]Yeah, I know what to do.
[192:22.60]I'm not stupid.
[192:25.38]Sorry, I reset.
[192:46.06]I can't.
[192:46.60]Okay.
[192:47.80]You absolutely go from there.
[192:49.06]Is there a quick slot for food?
[192:58.92]I think I asked that before.
[193:12.61]No, there isn't?
[193:15.43]What?
[193:17.21]Un-fucking-believable.
[193:22.60]What year is it, Nintendo?
[193:24.06]What year is it?
[193:24.90]Ooh.
[193:49.24]2022, we don't have a quick slot for healing items.
[193:56.45]Okay.
[194:13.24]What is wrong?
[194:17.85]What's, what is going on?
[194:19.41]Why can I not make it?
[194:21.99]I made it to, before, jermaTV, that email's supposed to be banned.
[194:27.97]I don't want to die.
[194:34.84]Oh, I was going, stop!
[194:36.18]I was going out of the stream, I'm fine.
[194:40.90]Alright, so what do I get for doing this?
[194:43.30]What kind of accolade do I get?
[194:49.77]Mods are making fun of me in mod chat because how bad I did the rock fight.
[194:57.88]Oh, a spirit.
[194:58.24]Okay, I need four of these.
[194:58.96]Okay.
[195:18.07]Okay.
[195:21.53]Dermotv.
[195:33.09]I'm having fun.
[195:34.23]I'm having fun.
[195:36.07]I know I'm not supposed to compare this to Elden Ring, but I'm going to.
[195:39.85]It's the same kind of... Go look over there.
[195:42.85]Go look over there.
[195:43.53]Go check that out.
[195:44.39]Go look over there.
[195:45.03]Go look over there.
[195:47.74]They're definitely not the same game, right?
[195:49.46]They're very different.
[195:50.68]They're pretty similar, but they're very different.
[195:54.58]So check this out.
[196:35.29]What is it?
[196:35.69]50 rupees!
[196:45.07]Alright.
[196:46.61]Um, what's that over there?
[196:47.43]I'll check it out later.
[196:53.26]I- Okay, that scared the shit out of me.
[196:55.64]I thought this was a gigantic dragon or something.
[196:57.62]I thought it was a huge dragon wing.
[196:58.78]Because I looked, it was right there.
[197:01.80]My peripheral.
[197:02.38]I thought it was a huge dragon.
[197:15.49]Let's get out.
[197:34.84]Is that a villain?
[197:37.38]Is this an NPC?
[197:54.37]We're doomed.
[197:54.91]I mean, don't panic.
[197:55.82]Sorry, who are you?
[197:56.36]Have we met?
[197:57.64]Doesn't matter who you are, really.
[197:58.86]I was getting tired of talking to myself, so you come at a good time.
[198:02.36]By the way, those strange things that popped out of the ground, did you see them?
[198:05.98]I'm talking about the mushrooms here.
[198:07.20]I'm talking about... Oh, okay.
[198:10.33]They seem to have popped up all over the place.
[198:12.27]And that's not the only strange thing that's happening.
[198:13.83]Those long-deserted shrines suddenly started glowing.
[198:16.33]You know what that means, don't you?
[198:18.19]The end is near.
[198:20.59]With all the craziness happening, I've been keeping an eye on that thing.
[198:23.82]Just to see if it suddenly starts moving.
[198:25.24]What the thing?
[198:27.94]I'm talking about that guardian, of course.
[198:31.78]Haven't you heard the old stories?
[198:34.83]See that thing over there?
[198:35.83]The one shaped like an overturned urn?
[198:38.60]That is what I'm talking about.
[198:40.92]Did you know that some of them can move?
[198:42.38]One of them once chased me down and tried to kill me.
[198:46.40]No, it was a different one.
[198:48.12]That one was closer to the castle, but before the forest.
[198:51.68]When they spot you, they shoot blue beams of light at you.
[198:56.06]Man, I was so sure that was the end for me.
[198:57.87]I was prepared for the worst until... Ugh.
[199:01.05]I got it right in the bone marrow.
[199:02.47]Let me tell you how to do it.
[199:09.54]I hear guardians like that still wander.
[199:12.04]Be careful.
[199:12.52]Thanks for no info.
[199:43.12]I'm just doing a physics test.
[200:09.50]Holy shit, what?
[200:22.94]Can I do anything with a ram?
[200:32.39]I guess not.
[201:01.77]What are you doing?
[201:02.55]Where's my weapon?
[201:19.93]Way too high.
[201:28.93]Oh, this guy's kind of strong.
[201:41.84]Stop rolling!
[201:47.01]Coco bat?
[202:12.10]No, I want to pick up the item.
[202:17.08]Pick it up!
[202:18.78]Pick up the pick.
[202:19.70]I want to do what I just did.
[202:22.90]Pick up the fucking rock, please.
[202:24.95]I need to do this.
[202:53.75]He fucking dropped it on- That was Bugs Bunny level shit right there.
[203:08.61]Ugh.
[203:13.27]Okay.
[203:16.85]He was trying to kill me.
[203:21.09]Oh, that's funny.
[203:21.91]Okay.
[203:23.11]Alright, so... What did I get for that?
[203:25.53]There was a chest right here, right?
[203:31.25]And there's food over here.
[203:35.25]Ooh, thank you.
[203:39.02]Should I tow some more stuff?
[203:47.48]Are they opal?
[203:49.58]Destroy crates.
[203:52.17]They have stuff in them?
[203:54.63]Oh, they do.
[203:55.67]Okay.
[203:58.89]Crab?
[204:00.93]Roasted bass?
[204:01.87]Oh, shit.
[204:02.37]Thank you for the reminder.
[204:03.96]Seriously.
[204:09.26]Is there a way I can break them without damaging an item?
[204:20.76]Okay, well, that didn't work.
[204:25.73]I can use the, uh, use magnet.
[204:28.97]Oh, I can just blow them up with... I'm an idiot.
[204:32.78]With a magnet.
[204:34.88]It was a shitty rusty sword anyways.
[204:36.10]Who cares?
[204:36.42]It doesn't matter.
[204:53.80]Ooh, blue rupee.
[205:02.67]I'm going to eat one of those crabs.
[205:31.58]Alright, let's keep going.
[205:36.60]Basecamp is covering what?
[205:41.94]What are you?
[205:42.24]What's going on?
[205:49.88]Go to the glowing mountain.
[205:57.25]Who said this event on the mountain?
[205:58.81]What do you mean?
[206:19.70]I almost fucking drowned in two feet of water again.
[206:21.62]Okay.
[206:26.92]No, no, no, nay, nay, nay, nay, nay.
[206:28.48]What?
[206:45.40]God, I hope Link gets in Smash Bros.
[206:46.98]this year.
[206:59.83]That was friendly.
[207:02.83]Another camp?
[207:29.93]I like the sounds.
[207:49.31]It's very peaceful over here.
[208:03.97]There it is.
[208:04.65]Okay.
[208:39.67]Okay.
[208:41.31]This and Bloodborne are my two favorite games.
[208:44.77]Well, I... If you're saying Bloodborne is one of your favorite games and this, I probably would agree with you at some point.
[208:49.99]Maybe we'll find out.
[208:54.89]Is anything else even over here?
[208:55.81]There's gotta be like an item in here, right?
[209:02.03]Pass me an item.
[209:08.52]There's no way there's no item here.
[209:24.04]Why would there be a camp with no item?
[209:32.90]Wait, what is the actual destination here?
[209:36.53]Oh my god, that's far away.
[209:38.57]That's across the whole game.
[209:40.33]Can I even make it?
[209:44.09]Can I make it there?
[209:55.17]Well, maybe I should activate that thing, right?
[210:02.55]Give me some location data.
[210:06.90]Dude, you just got Elden Ring.
[210:12.64]Oh, I kind of did.
[210:15.74]Alright.
[210:24.27]You can go anywhere and you can climb anything.
[210:26.56]I got Elden Ring.
[210:53.60]Stop saying Elden Ring.
[210:55.26]Elden... Okay, do you know how hard it's going to be to not say anything about Elden Ring?
[210:58.52]I know I'm not supposed to be, but think about it.
[211:01.92]That was one of the most ridiculous... Hold on a sec.
[211:15.73]The bow broke in my hands.
[211:17.09]Okay, well, never mind.
[211:38.91]This guy's another strong one.
[211:42.29]Oh my god, I just baseball swung him.
[212:04.12]Is there an instant kill backstab or something?
[212:21.00]He didn't wake up.
[212:21.98]Why?
[212:22.30]Okay.
[212:41.72]Hello?
[212:45.34]Why did that happen?
[212:59.09]It was- the fire does that.
[213:04.31]Really?
[213:04.63]I can cook over here.
[213:25.26]Alright, hold on.
[213:27.28]Let me open... I want to cook some stuff.
[213:32.05]Alright, so I have a lot of random stuff.
[213:38.15]One shroom.
[213:40.02]Two shrooms.
[213:41.62]Okay, how about like a shroom surprise?
[213:57.87]Mushroom skewer.
[214:04.06]Can I just... What happens if you just cook one apple?
[214:13.24]Simmered fruit.
[214:14.88]Okay, so there's only one... No.
[214:16.26]You gotta... This is gonna be three hearts.
[214:27.71]Right?
[214:28.03]Yeah.
[214:28.29]Okay.
[214:28.67]So it's about... Quantity means more health.
[214:32.41]I get it.
[214:42.48]Okay, cool.
[214:45.64]Was there a chest?
[214:49.44]I don't think so, right?
[215:02.32]Chasing fucking apples around like an idiot.
[215:09.06]Chasing apples around like a dumbass.
[215:13.88]Alright, let's turn this thing on.
[215:28.11]Dueling Peaks Tower.
[215:33.08]Get some map info here.
[215:48.08]Um, I think I want it for now.
[215:50.55]I think I'd rather have it for now.
[216:13.65]Do motion aiming?
[216:14.43]No, I hate motion aiming.
[216:16.75]It only ever worked in my brain for the Wii.
[216:21.80]Using two hands to use a gyroscope is unbearable for me.
[216:26.52]The Wii was fine because the Wii was one hand, right?
[216:29.32]It was almost like a mouse pointer.
[216:31.32]But needing to hold two hands like this and go like a... No, no, no, no.
[216:36.35]It doesn't work for me at all.
[216:37.53]I don't like it.
[216:45.18]Use the Joy-Cons?
[216:46.28]Why would I ever use the Joy-Cons?
[216:54.46]The Joy-Cons are my least favorite controller ever made.
[216:56.94]They are hands down the worst possible device that was ever invented.
[217:05.61]They are so bad.
[217:07.79]They are so small.
[217:09.39]The buttons are so tiny.
[217:12.11]Pressing, I'm saying, I'm telling you.
[217:15.13]If you try to press X on a Joy-Con, there's a real possibility you're going to hit every single other button.
[217:23.54]It's a face button.
[217:24.86]They're so bad.
[217:25.70]They're just so tiny, and it hurts to hold them for a long time.
[217:42.23]Uh-oh.
[217:42.85]We effing?
[217:43.99]Looks like it.
[217:47.25]It looks like we're seeing some small eff behavior here.
[217:53.08]Okay.
[217:55.12]Ah, there's a road.
[217:55.98]There's like a road here.
[218:01.82]A Sheikah sensor.
[218:04.18]The sensor reacts when you are close to shrines that you have not yet visited.
[218:09.05]Okay.
[218:09.23]If you head in the direction where the reaction is strongest, you should be able to find the shrine.
[218:13.52]Okay.
[218:19.46]Wait, it's on the map.
[218:21.06]That's weird.
[218:23.32]When do you play Dog Island?
[218:24.60]Didn't I already play Dog Island?
[218:32.85]Search for shrines by moving in the direction with the strongest signal.
[218:35.83]Shrine nearby.
[218:38.45]Okay.
[219:01.28]Like this way?
[219:03.04]Hold on.
[219:05.44]Yeah, getting some Fs.
[219:06.90]It should even out though.
[219:07.90]It should be okay in a few minutes.
[219:14.57]So it's this way?
[219:33.75]That's not the right weapon.
[219:43.07]Let go!
[219:52.83]Flint!
[220:09.18]Am I going the right way here?
[220:20.26]Yeah, it's gonna be bad for a little bit.
[220:22.55]I have no idea why.
[220:23.87]I don't know why I'd be... We were just fine for like almost four hours.
[220:32.39]This doesn't make any sense.
[220:34.39]Ah, I found it!
[220:44.52]Not a big deal.
[220:45.04]Yeah, it's alright.
[220:49.44]Yeah, I really don't get it.
[220:50.90]It's so bizarre.
[220:52.58]So I did a 14 hour stream two days ago.
[220:55.77]I didn't drop one single frame.
[220:57.77]Streaming to the same server.
[221:00.31]And now here we are.
[221:02.49]Not even, what, a day later?
[221:04.25]A day and a half later?
[221:05.09]And it's just kind of shit in the bed now.
[221:08.21]It's weird.
[221:08.85]It doesn't make any sense.
[221:14.86]And it's the... It's not like, oh, it's because it's 8 o'clock and it's getting busy.
[221:21.27]I have a fiber to the house.
[221:23.67]So I don't share a connection with anybody.
[221:26.32]It doesn't make any sense.
[221:28.26]I don't get it.
[221:30.96]Okay.
[221:31.78]I am Reed Dahi.
[221:33.75]In the name of this, I have a challenge for you.
[221:45.87]ISP throttle?
[221:46.50]I don't, I mean, I have a... it's a 1000 up connection.
[221:50.00]I'm only using- I'm not using that much.
[221:52.70]Six up? 
[221:54.00]That's- no, no way.
[221:58.45]Alright dump that in there.
[222:02.00]Ooh, cool.
[222:05.00]Alright so, I'll probably have to- uh.
[222:14.00]Let's go.
[222:18.43]Somebody said, Rich Andy?
[222:19.43]Uh, actually, no.
[222:21.59]Like... This connection... This is the dumbest thing about, uh, high-speed internet.
[222:27.41]So... This line is less than $100 a month.
[222:33.00]It's less than... I think it's like... 80 or... I think it's like 80 bucks a month for this.
[222:37.34]I was paying...
[222:40.35]at the old place Cox Business Internet.
[222:44.35]It was fucking it was like three or $400 a month.
[222:48.61]And it was for a 20 times slower connection.
[222:52.77]Sharing with the whole neighborhood is fucking ridiculous.
[222:55.85]It's absolutely ridiculous.
[223:05.32]And it was still shitty.
[223:06.18]Yep.
[223:06.46]Oh, yeah.
[223:08.51]Did I just accidentally do this?
[223:10.46]I wasn't paying any attention.
[223:11.38]I think I just did it.
[223:25.18]Okay, cool.
[223:25.62]I think it looks like it's fine now.
[223:46.08]Can I launch it?
[223:46.90]Wait, hold on.
[223:59.39]Um, what is that?
[224:00.37]Why did that... What was that for?
[224:05.43]Wait, wait, wait.
[224:05.91]Hold on.
[224:06.29]I can stop the ball.
[224:12.64]Okay.
[224:17.25]I'm sorry.
[224:48.39]Yeah, you don't like launch it.
[225:35.45]You do launch it.
[225:37.27]I was playing chess and I was supposed to play checkers.
[225:40.27]I'm sitting there thinking, I've got to freeze it and then knock it three times.
[225:53.94]Yeah, that's my fault.
[225:59.85]How do I get that?
[226:27.69]Like this.
[226:55.04]Never mind.
[227:34.25]Say laugh, laugh.
[227:35.15]Go ahead, laugh.
[227:48.60]What are you doing?
[227:50.06]I could have just grabbed the ledge.
[227:51.30]I could have done that.
[227:54.14]I actually could have done that.
[227:55.04]And my nose right here is itchy.
[227:56.50]I'm sorry.
[228:23.83]I can't do it.
[228:38.58]Fuck this.
[228:39.16]Watch this.
[229:04.94]That was so close.
[229:20.63]I fucking had it.
[229:21.57]You saw it.
[229:22.21]It was right there.
[229:23.17]Alright, last try.
[229:26.62]I'm not doing this anymore.
[229:27.92]It doesn't really matter.
[229:37.69]What do you mean?
[229:38.31]Eat it!
[229:49.16]I have to do it.
[229:50.36]I have to do it.
[229:50.94]I'm not going to leave until I do.
[229:51.90]I don't care.
[229:52.32]I don't give a shit if this is the worst Legend of Zelda playthrough you've ever seen in your life.
[229:56.66]I don't care.
[229:57.12]I'm going to get it.
[230:15.57]I'm gonna run out of food.
[230:16.81]I'm gonna run out of food if I'm not careful.
[230:21.11]How did I get on the first time?
[230:22.65]Fuck!
[230:35.92]I'm fucking done.
[230:36.60]I'm done.
[230:36.88]I'm done.
[230:37.14]I'm actually done.
[230:37.96]I'm not running.
[230:38.54]Fuck you.
[230:40.12]I had it.
[230:40.76]It was the first try and I landed but I rolled off like an idiot.
[230:55.56]I need to run and jump off and then get blown from behind.
[230:58.20]Alright, I'm gonna get full health.
[231:13.44]All that food wasted?
[231:14.34]Guys, I'll just rob a bunch of trolls and get another two pounds of apples.
[231:19.24]I'll be alright, don't worry.
[231:27.76]Okay.
[231:42.93]Do I even need that chest?
[231:51.71]Go back and get it.
[232:06.86]I need to stay... Yeah, I know.
[232:08.26]I need to stay... Whatever.
[232:24.91]This is so fucking impatient.
[232:30.60]I just want to get over there and open it.
[233:22.31]Okay.
[233:23.49]Now... Stasis the button, somebody said.
[233:31.01]Hold on.
[233:42.80]Oh, because... Okay, I see.
[233:44.12]I get it.
[233:44.44]I actually see.
[233:53.07]I get it.
[233:56.38]Oh, my God.
[233:56.96]How can one person be so such a fool?
[234:00.05]How can one person be such a fool?
[234:26.79]Hurry up!
[235:00.39]Oh my god, this thing takes forever.
[235:02.43]I made it.
[235:12.68]Climber's bandana.
[235:13.96]Okay, that really was worth doing.
[235:20.84]Can this break?
[235:28.12]This is definitely worth getting.
[235:32.32]Can you teleport me back to the beginning so I don't die?
[235:34.02]Cool.
[235:42.90]Alright, so now I can climb better.
[235:44.90]Armor never breaks.
[235:45.66]Cool.
[235:45.76]Good to know.
[235:58.38]That was a cool shrine.
[236:01.78]Now, where do I want to go?
[236:03.22]I could keep heading this way, right?
[236:09.00]I would be surprised if there was a way to go up.
[236:11.84]So, I'm going to head towards the bridge.
[236:15.49]This way.
[236:15.87]I'm just going to keep heading over here.
[236:29.35]I suppose you look for fish, right?
[236:30.63]This is probably the easiest thing to get.
[236:31.71]Never mind.
[236:45.34]Trying nearby.
[236:45.98]Not talking about that one, is it?
[237:03.03]Who cares?
[237:18.25]It does not detect cleared shrines.
[237:20.71]Okay, cool.
[237:21.60]Throwing spear.
[237:28.52]Alright, I got so much dumb shit.
[237:30.48]I gotta get rid of some of this stuff.
[237:36.05]I'm trying to break this.
[237:45.53]Where's my stuff?
[237:50.22]Everybody get away from me!
[237:51.16]Just keep away from me!
[238:00.01]I thought I could get away with it.
[238:05.04]I probably actually could have gotten away with it.
[238:10.42]On purpose.
[238:10.76]Oh, I did it on purpose.
[238:11.78]Oh, yeah.
[238:12.70]I thought I could... I actually thought I could get away with it.
[238:14.40]I definitely can.
[238:17.49]If they're sleeping, I can definitely just sneak in and do it.
[238:20.09]There's no penalty for dying anyways.
[238:21.29]Who cares?
[238:47.13]Come the fuck on.
[238:47.97]How did that not hit?
[239:01.16]Where am I?
[239:03.24]Excuse me?
[239:06.54]Whatever, I'll try it again.
[239:07.50]Do you have a bow?
[239:24.17]Yeah, I have a bow.
[239:25.05]You shoot three arrows and it goes, oops, broken my hands.
[240:20.46]Broadsword?
[240:22.32]You need to light the arrow.
[240:28.32]God damn it.
[240:28.80]I didn't know that.
[240:29.40]Okay.
[240:32.72]Do you want ketchup on your hot dogs?
[240:35.62]I actually like mustard.
[240:36.48]I don't really like ketchup on a hot dog.
[240:43.48]Alright.
[240:43.72]Time to get rid of some of this absolute crap that I have here.
[240:52.20]This is six.
[240:53.06]This thing sucks.
[240:53.82]Get rid of it.
[240:57.38]What else do I have?
[240:59.62]This thing... Do I really need two torches?
[241:02.35]No, I don't.
[241:02.89]Get rid of it.
[241:07.27]This is a throwing spear.
[241:08.59]That's pretty good.
[241:09.27]I definitely want the broadsword.
[241:13.47]Hot dogs are overrated?
[241:17.47]It depends on where you're getting them from.
[241:22.53]Some hot dogs are very overrated, you're right.
[241:25.49]But not all of them.
[241:32.37]Some hot dogs are incredibly overrated.
[241:38.50]You don't... How about this?
[241:41.06]Uh, boomerang.
[241:43.94]That's cool.
[241:45.04]God.
[241:47.68]Dude.
[242:01.45]What should I get rid of?
[242:15.94]This thing looks awesome.
[242:16.74]Alright, cool.
[242:18.45]Uh, spear?
[242:20.91]Get rid of the leaf?
[242:24.29]Why would you throw the... You threw away a claymore.
[242:27.19]Yeah, because it was like 10 damage.
[242:28.93]Everything else I had was good.
[242:35.40]I need to cook stuff.
[242:36.51]Salt?
[243:04.07]Oh, there's somebody over there.
[243:05.13]I need fish.
[243:05.65]I'm gonna go catch this fish right here.
[243:07.73]I'm gonna drop down and grab it.
[243:13.16]Got it.
[243:13.36]Okay.
[243:14.90]Cooking into a dish will fortify your bones.
[243:21.08]God, there's definitely food over here.
[243:23.15]Uh, not food.
[243:25.41]There was a cooking fire over there, but I don't have any... I have one fish.
[243:33.81]Okay.
[243:36.29]What is that?
[243:36.77]Looks like a little hut.
[243:44.67]Hot-footed frog?
[243:47.91]Cook it?
[243:48.45]I don't want to cook a frog.
[243:52.62]Sneaky river snail.
[243:57.66]So wait, I'm just gonna make like a frog snail fish soup?
[244:09.57]Ah, this is the life.
[244:12.31]Good evening.
[244:12.69]Don't see a whole lot of travelers passing through here.
[244:14.57]You know, with how peaceful it is around here and sometimes easy to forget that the world almost ended years ago.
[244:19.91]There's still monsters wandering around in the area near Hyrule Castle is especially dangerous.
[244:24.76]Do you know anything about elixirs?
[244:29.90]You can make elixirs by mixing bugs and other small creatures with monster parts.
[244:36.27]Most of them are no good for refilling your health, but they can have a lot of unique effects.
[244:39.41]Some elixirs can increase your speed, resistance to temperatures.
[244:44.75]You made it this far without knowing anything about them.
[244:48.06]Okay.
[244:51.16]Grants a low-level haste effect.
[244:55.82]That's cool.
[244:59.04]Hightail lizard in monster parts.
[245:06.64]Okay.
[245:20.59]I need a... How much money do I have?
[245:24.91]Can I buy stuff?
[245:26.21]Are you a merchant?
[245:29.11]I don't believe I made your acquaintance.
[245:31.49]The name's Beetle, but you can call me... Actually, let's stick with Beetle.
[245:36.09]Beetle-shaped backpack.
[245:39.53]Shopping needs.
[245:40.47]Alright.
[245:41.35]I stock bugs and items.
[245:46.12]Ooh.
[245:48.46]I also buy all sorts of things if you're in need of rupees.
[245:50.94]Gemstones in particular fetch a high price.
[245:53.71]Uh, what have you got?
[245:55.77]Crickets?
[245:59.51]Crickets?
[246:02.63]Stamina recovery elixir.
[246:05.95]Speed boost elixir.
[246:07.55]Octoballoon?
[246:08.13]Maybe I should just buy arrows.
[246:23.03]Get the balloon.
[246:23.63]How many should I buy?
[246:27.79]Just one?
[246:28.13]Alright, I'll buy one balloon.
[246:37.87]Okay, what do I got?
[246:38.67]Um... I have a very important question.
[246:45.52]Do I need to hold on to the... What is just... Defender bullshit?
[246:52.68]I want to be backseated over this.
[246:54.36]Should I hold on to any of these gems, or... Just, oh, like, Amber, and... Ruby, and opals, and... Sell the rubies.
[247:05.67]Gems are good money, just sell it.
[247:07.23]Sell it.
[247:08.97]It's fine for a little while.
[247:10.55]Keep at least one to five of each gem.
[247:17.00]So I shouldn't sell it.
[247:19.44]You need to hold on to at least one.
[247:27.49]Contain the power of fire and have fetched a high price.
[247:31.57]Oh, hold on.
[247:32.29]I'll keep it for now.
[247:41.54]OK.
[247:41.84]Opal, for instance, right?
[247:42.86]Power of water.
[247:44.18]It's too early to use it.
[247:52.40]OK, I'll sell the rupee.
[248:01.35]So should I buy anything else then?
[248:02.49]Should I buy all the octoballoons?
[248:07.83]Alright, I'm buying the whole... I'm buying all the octagonal ones.
[248:14.15]Maybe get some arrows too?
[248:14.93]Alright, I'm gonna get... Ten... I'm gonna get ten arrows.
[248:19.95]Very cool.
[248:29.58]What else is over here?
[248:33.70]Stable.
[248:36.84]What's going on?
[248:39.33]Kakariko Village is ways north of here.
[248:41.55]If you're going to Dueling Peak Stable, it's not much further from here.
[248:46.45]It's right next to me, actually.
[248:48.95]You can usually find me at the stables.
[248:50.89]Let's do business right here.
[248:52.81]I carry only the finest meats.
[248:57.30]Raw prime meat.
[248:58.86]Ooh.
[249:05.18]Should I get a bunch of prime meat?
[249:18.55]Want salt?
[249:24.77]Can I sell some stuff?
[249:25.91]I have some meat to sell.
[249:28.88]Do you want, um... Ten, that's it.
[249:33.46]Okay.
[249:41.15]Okay.
[249:50.80]Um, how do you catch a horse?
[250:20.65]Hop on slowly from behind.
[250:28.33]Soothe it.
[250:29.79]It'll settle down and bring it to me.
[250:31.47]Okay.
[250:32.48]It may take a while for wild horses to get used to being... They change directions to slow down until you get whatever.
[250:41.44]Redirect it.
[250:43.02]Feed it or something.
[250:46.53]Oh.
[250:47.83]Hi.
[250:50.62]I do not.
[250:51.32]Oh, you want to rest.
[250:52.60]Is it free?
[251:02.38]I want to sleep.
[251:05.27]Stay for a rest.
[251:06.39]Oh, head to the counter.
[251:07.27]Okay.
[251:13.37]Really?
[251:13.61]You could have just done it right there.
[251:19.88]How much?
[251:20.68]20 rupees?
[251:33.19]No, that's way too much.
[251:34.27]20 rupees.
[251:35.17]20 rupees.
[251:47.56]I've got the scoop on Misko's treasure, and it's great.
[251:50.04]Listen up.
[251:52.02]Wait, wait, wait.
[251:52.34]Hang on.
[251:55.58]What's your problem?
[251:56.19]You aren't being incredibly rude and listening to our conversation, are you?
[251:59.87]Treasure hunters.
[252:01.21]The treasure of the great bandit Misko.
[252:05.13]You're going to give it all away.
[252:06.11]Don't tell him.
[252:06.71]Sorry.
[252:07.15]I got carried away.
[252:26.02]okay okay so you want I need to pay for a hint how much oh 100 rupees
[252:55.20]Alright, I need to cook.
[252:56.76]There we go, cool.
[252:59.50]Wait, there are horses right here.
[253:03.34]Look at this little horse!
[253:06.54]Wow.
[253:07.04]I've never seen one like this before.
[253:17.87]What was that?
[253:20.95]Wait, can I- can I feed you or anything?
[253:25.37]Can I, like, do anything?
[254:03.51]This person's sleeping.
[254:08.23]Can I kill somebody with this?
[254:17.60]No, I don't think so.
[254:21.52]I'll give you directions.
[254:24.18]That was a kid.
[254:24.81]What?
[254:35.17]I don't know where I'm trying to go.
[254:36.29]I need to cook, though.
[254:46.94]Okay.
[254:47.92]So I've got... I think I'm just going to do raw prime meat.
[254:52.92]An apple.
[254:55.40]Right?
[254:55.72]For flavor.
[254:56.32]And a little bit of salt.
[254:59.29]So this is like an apple salt-glazed...
[255:05.31]With uh... with bokoblin guts.
[255:11.00]I think that's a good start, right?
[255:12.00]That should be good?
[255:17.50]Salt apple glazed, um... Pork shoulder, whatever the hell this is.
[255:25.00]Okay.
[255:37.44]Don't do apple.
[255:38.92]Just salt.
[255:50.17]What?
[255:50.47]Don't add this.
[255:51.03]What are you talking about?
[255:52.01]Is this bad?
[255:53.81]Meat and salt, right?
[256:01.69]That's not worth 60 rupees.
[256:03.37]What am I?
[256:03.93]Something's wrong.
[256:15.10]Fish and mushroom.
[256:17.86]Fish and mushroom stew.
[256:29.77]Buying meat's never worth it.
[256:34.11]That really is a fish and mushroom stew.
[256:56.96]Do I even have monster parts?
[257:02.33]So, like, this and the frog.
[257:05.33]Right?
[257:07.15]Okay.
[257:15.53]Hasty elixir.
[257:16.37]Cool.
[257:18.55]Next slide, please.
[257:20.09]Yeah, I don't know, man.
[257:21.87]I really don't get it.
[257:25.90]Like, some nights it'll... It's something to do with the connection that I have to Twitch.
[257:30.34]And it doesn't matter how much troubleshooting I'll do.
[257:38.63]I'm probably going to call my ISP.
[257:40.51]Just be like, hey, is there anything I can even do about this or what?
[257:45.51]It's so random.
[257:51.43]Pitchfork.
[258:03.08]Yeah, I cannot even... I can't come up with the reason why this would ever be happening.
[258:08.40]I have fiber to the house.
[258:11.66]I will go at a thousand a thousand for 20 straight hours.
[258:15.62]And then just... It just does this for like an hour or two straight.
[258:20.50]Sometimes randomly for no reason.
[258:31.25]I don't know.
[258:36.83]Yeah, I'm going to heal.
[258:44.23]Okay, let's see.
[258:44.91]Let me do this shrine.
[258:49.11]Save the game?
[258:49.67]There's no auto-save.
[258:52.69]Looks like I saved it.
[258:53.90]Hey.
[259:22.56]Interesting.
[259:30.69]A plan?
[259:53.63]Pretty good plan.
[260:11.32]Hey!
[260:12.58]What?
[260:13.36]Why did it run out?
[260:16.46]What happened?
[260:16.94]Did I not have stamina?
[260:19.34]What the hell just happened?
[260:29.96]That was going to work.
[260:34.13]That was going to actually work.
[260:35.37]That was going to be fine.
[260:39.29]I ran this... Alright, alright.
[260:40.79]I'm going to jump from here and just glide over it.
[260:42.57]Wait.
[260:42.71]Can I climb this and just do that instead?
[260:51.63]No.
[260:51.93]That's definitely what... That's what I'm doing.
[261:04.22]Probably don't have to go that high.
[261:06.37]There we go.
[261:07.19]Okay, so... Yep.
[261:44.84]Okay.
[261:49.22]Look at my hair.
[262:02.22]My hair's really kind of greasy today.
[262:05.32]Shouldn't be, I washed it.
[262:17.67]OK.
[262:21.21]The water guides.
[262:42.10]Very cool.
[262:45.21]Alright, from here.
[262:52.89]Oh, that's neat.
[263:02.24]Why did I not?
[263:04.99]Why did I think that was ever going to be a thing that would work?
[263:07.89]I thought I could get around it.
[263:22.97]Ooh, weird.
[263:23.76]Okay.
[264:59.77]Hmm.
[265:46.08]Fuck.
[267:16.60]I don't want to go- I just didn't want to run all the way back up here and do it- You know what I'm saying?
[267:53.76]Ha ha ha!
[267:54.94]Ha!
[269:05.92]Fucking asshole.
[269:35.10]Oh.
[270:18.95]Hmm.
[271:06.64]I dodge an axe if you swing it at me.
[271:09.48]I told you, I'm smoking fucking cigarettes in the corner.
[271:18.96]I have to, like, get it at the right angle and freeze it.
[271:26.68]You know what I mean?
[271:28.08]It's gotta move, and then I gotta freeze it.
[271:37.40]Are we still dropping frames?
[271:49.08]Is this still happening?
[271:55.74]Yeah, God damn it.
[271:57.10]What the fuck?
[272:00.17]I don't get it.
[272:01.75]I don't understand.
[272:02.47]I don't get it.
[272:04.51]Doesn't make any sense.
[272:16.45]I need two more, right?
[272:32.23]I like this aspect of the game.
[272:33.33]It's really cool.
[272:40.24]The shrines are some of my favorite part.
[272:53.09]You like the worst part of the game.
[272:54.87]Really?
[272:56.41]I think it's really fun.
[273:00.23]I like it.
[273:10.68]Okay.
[273:14.66]So now I got this.
[273:15.96]I gotta go up here.
[273:17.76]That's far away, but I'll make it.
[273:23.66]Go get a horse.
[273:24.74]Well, I gotta find a wild horse.
[273:26.26]It's not just gonna happen.
[273:27.91]They're right here?
[274:05.56]I want the blue one.
[274:29.05]I'll take this one instead.
[274:35.61]Got it
[275:17.88]What did I just do?
[275:21.66]How do you actually ride the horse?
[275:23.10]Is there a jump?
[275:44.89]I want to register this horse, please.
[276:06.28]I want to talk!
[276:09.14]Get back here.
[276:10.02]Come back, come back, come back, come back.
[276:24.93]I want to register this horse!
[276:44.26]Thank you.
[276:45.76]Jesus.
[276:53.26]Ooh, okay.
[276:59.83]Yes.
[277:00.07]20 rupees?
[277:01.05]Saddle and riddle?
[277:02.89]Yeah, let's do it.
[277:06.39]I need a name.
[277:07.03]I don't know.
[277:16.83]I'm going to go pee.
[277:17.87]I haven't peed in like five hours.
[277:22.06]Pee?
[277:22.28]Alright, pee break and we'll come back and you'll see what the horse is named.
[277:30.68]In the meantime, the stream might F for a second while I do a test of some sort.
[277:34.26]I'll be right back.
[278:10.79]Yeah, I don't understand.
[278:11.91]So, I just, I'm doing speed test right now.
[278:19.89]I have, I mean, it's a stable 900 up.
[278:27.02]I gotta talk to somebody at data at Twitch.
[278:29.24]Bad.
[278:29.60]And I actually have to do it now.
[278:34.97]Something about where my connection is hopping from Vegas to the servers I go to.
[278:39.31]It's just something happens all the time.
[278:49.75]I don't think it can be something on my end.
[278:53.39]It's hard to determine that because two days ago I streamed for 14 hours and we didn't drop one frame.
[278:59.40]Not one.
[279:01.26]Same time frame too.
[279:02.74]Same time.
[279:04.21]Friday night.
[279:05.89]It's not like, oh yeah, you were streaming on like a Wednesday at 2 o'clock in the morning.
[279:09.27]I mean, that was Friday at 8, 9, 10 o'clock at night.
[279:12.95]Not one frame.
[279:14.41]Here we are Sunday night.
[279:17.15]And... For what?
[279:19.43]For four hours?
[279:20.33]It's not a single frame.
[279:23.67]It's just bizarre.
[279:25.28]And then it's, oh!
[279:26.78]Now all of a sudden, you're just gonna start dropping packets to Twitch.
[279:31.90]Why?
[279:37.09]Go pee?
[279:37.61]No, I will, I will.
[279:39.03]But just so, it doesn't make any sense, right?
[279:40.15]Like, you... Okay, if I was consistently having internet problems, that would make sense.
[279:44.04]But you can't have a stream go flawlessly for four hours and then randomly at, like, 8.15.
[279:49.54]It's just, oh, now everything sucks.
[279:53.50]And if I do a speed test, or if I do, like, an upload test, it's like, no, your connection's perfectly normal.
[279:58.50]It's the data leaving here from Vegas.
[280:02.97]It's hitting some point, some hop in a trace route, right?
[280:06.03]If you did one.
[280:07.13]And it's just junking up somewhere on the road at some point.
[280:10.26]I don't get it.
[280:10.68]I don't know.
[280:12.20]But I'm going to go pee.
[280:13.54]I'll be right back.
[286:56.38]Okay, I'm back.
[287:00.13]Looks like I didn't drop a frame while I was gone.
[287:03.73]It's kind of strange.
[287:08.12]Okay.
[287:10.52]Sorry I scared you.
[287:29.06]Frank.
[287:42.45]Do I like it?
[287:43.45]The game is great, yeah.
[287:44.33]Okay, can horses die?
[287:48.59]Can a horse die?
[287:55.62]So if I go out with this horse, can the horse die?
[287:59.61]Okay, I'm kind of concerned about that, to be honest.
[288:09.79]Okay.
[288:14.22]So I need to go from here.
[288:15.64]We need to go straight, right?
[288:17.14]I'm just going to go on the road.
[288:29.77]How do you turn?
[288:39.00]Yeah, this is a nice- it's a good looking horse.
[288:49.00]Okay here's a- uh... this is- this is a bridge out.
[288:54.00]Kakariko bridge.
[289:02.11]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[289:03.19]Okay.
[289:03.69]I'm almost there!
[289:16.12]Looks pretty cool.
[289:21.14]See?
[289:21.38]I'm petting the horse.
[289:22.56]I'm fine.
[289:39.16]I'm sad.
[289:39.64]I ran over an animal.
[289:46.58]Can you... Is there no jumping with the horse bones?
[289:50.14]Actually?
[290:07.03]It's automatic jumping.
[290:08.05]Okay.
[290:22.97]Turning is hard.
[290:28.36]Go!
[290:29.10]What's wrong?
[290:35.94]Okay.
[290:38.60]Go back!
[290:39.18]Go back!
[290:39.58]You walked past Broccoli Man!
[290:42.08]Who's Broccoli Man?
[290:45.33]Go!
[290:45.65]Go!
[290:45.89]You walked past Broccoli Man!
[290:49.49]That's Broccoli Man.
[290:50.61]Okay.
[291:02.73]Do this.
[291:03.11]Okay.
[291:06.85]You can see me?
[291:07.55]I can see you.
[291:16.57]Oh, I'm Hestu, and I need your... This is, okay, where we bring the stuff.
[291:34.81]I can't use my powers without them.
[291:36.93]Please.
[291:37.83]Please get my maracas back from them.
[291:41.19]You got it.
[292:07.24]No!
[292:25.76]I was trying to ram.
[292:26.78]I was trying to ram!
[292:35.53]The horse is causing all kinds of problems.
[292:39.11]I'm gonna get off the horse.
[292:45.54]I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that twice.
[292:46.72]I'm trying so hard to turn.
[293:02.83]You know what?
[293:03.11]Just hang it out here.
[293:03.87]You're fine.
[293:04.21]Just chill out there.
[293:05.34]We'll be good.
[293:05.72]Got a little bit of business to take care of.
[293:09.29]Oh, I haven't escaped!
[293:45.86]I spit everywhere.
[293:49.74]I'm just so impatient.
[293:59.24]Lock on.
[294:00.10]It's the... I want to be able to just attack.
[294:04.22]You know what I mean?
[294:08.67]Give me this thing.
[294:10.19]Fuck this thing.
[294:10.87]Give me this thing.
[294:11.93]Way better.
[294:12.33]I'm going to use an actual item.
[294:35.06]Here we go.
[294:40.10]There we go.
[294:43.24]Use spells?
[294:46.38]What spell would you want me to use?
[294:47.66]Freeze one?
[294:49.78]Ooh.
[295:03.58]Pyromancy.
[295:04.14]Okay, Hestus Maracas.
[295:08.85]This game is sick.
[295:13.69]Okay, let me take a quick look and see what I would rate this right now out of 10.
[295:19.31]I probably would give it like a 4.
[295:28.12]Hmm.
[295:37.29]The only reason it's not getting a zero is so people don't get really mad when I give it a low score.
[295:41.51]I think a four is okay.
[295:49.25]What?
[295:56.29]No, this is really fun.
[295:57.38]I like it a lot.
[296:12.08]It's just really fun.
[296:13.34]There's lots of fun things to do.
[296:21.27]Here are your maracas.
[296:24.09]Can we get a number?
[296:25.53]Why would you want a number?
[296:29.87]It's definitely better than an 8.
[296:31.91]It's 100% higher than an 8.
[296:34.99]It's somewhere between 8 and 10.
[296:35.93]I just don't know where.
[296:36.93]I need to keep going.
[296:46.55]This game is objectively better than Elden Ring.
[296:53.25]We'll see.
[296:53.59]I don't know.
[297:00.01]Inventory expansion.
[297:01.57]That's a huge deal.
[297:08.39]I have one.
[297:16.65]Um, yeah.
[297:24.21]Oh, definitely weapon, right?
[297:28.20]I keep having so much trouble with weapons.
[297:34.06]No frames dropped, either.
[297:36.38]In the last, like, ten minutes.
[297:41.20]Is there scientists that can even explain how that's possible?
[297:48.14]Okay.
[297:49.30]Da-na-na-na-na!
[297:54.25]The weapons stash has been expanded.
[298:03.44]Cool.
[298:08.83]Good to know.
[298:09.47]That's where... I need to mark this, right?
[298:12.94]Okay, I'm going to stamp this a pin here.
[298:16.06]Yeah, I need to put a pin here.
[298:19.10]I'm going to say this is this, right?
[298:24.32]Okay, let's keep going.
[298:30.92]Are you gonna collect all 900 seeds?
[298:35.04]I would be happy if I were to get the first boss on stream.
[298:41.95]Be real.
[298:45.01]How did you guys- Alright, it's been about five hours of this game.
[298:50.34]It's time to do the poll.
[298:56.01]Do you want to see more... I really almost said Elden Ring.
[299:00.67]Do you want to see more Breath of the Wild?
[299:04.00]Would you like me to keep playing this?
[299:05.36]Would you like me to be this what I play when I stream again?
[299:09.90]Like the next stream.
[299:11.22]The next stream that you see on this channel, do you want it to be this?
[299:22.01]We need a poll.
[299:24.05]One is yes, two is no.
[299:27.33]Do you want this to be the next thing that I play?
[299:29.35]Like, on the next stream?
[299:31.13]Just keep going.
[299:33.73]A lot of people were... I mean, the internet problems probably booted a lot of you guys, but there were a lot of people here tonight.
[299:40.34]A surprising amount of people, so... If you guys like it, I'll definitely keep playing it.
[299:47.96]I like it.
[299:49.05]So if you guys like it, then why not?
[299:57.33]Yeah, use the pole.
[299:58.33]Vote on that pole.
[300:02.30]Crying somewhere.
[300:08.54]Oh, this is Kakariko Village.
[300:17.25]Gravel, I'm sorry, but I seem to have twisted my ankle.
[300:22.99]You alright?
[300:26.15]Sorry you had to see me like that.
[300:29.35]Say traveler.
[300:29.93]Where'd you get that object hanging from your waist?
[300:36.89]I found it.
[300:37.31]From the dead guy that I killed.
[300:42.95]Okay, we've been waiting for you for a very long time.
[300:51.92]I must insist that you meet with our leader, Lady Impa.
[301:01.45]Lady Impa's house is below Lantern Falls, just over there.
[301:03.73]In any case, it was a real honor to meet you.
[301:06.89]Nice to meet you, too.
[301:14.76]They probably have a shrine in here somewhere, right?
[301:18.00]I imagine.
[301:26.32]I like the shrines the most.
[301:29.65]Wow, that's a lot.
[301:30.55]That's 90%.
[301:31.53]Damn.
[301:33.55]I cannot deny that.
[301:35.87]I can't deny that.
[301:36.83]That's way too high to deny.
[301:38.89]So we're going to keep playing Breath of the Wild.
[301:50.94]There's 120 shrines in the game?
[301:51.94]Wow.
[301:54.42]Wow.
[302:05.68]Yes, it looks like everybody voted.
[302:07.34]4,000 of you.
[302:09.48]89% said to play more Breath of the Wild.
[302:11.76]Nice.
[302:12.00]Okay.
[302:12.16]I'm excited, I think.
[302:40.82]Why did I pretend to like it?
[302:41.82]I'm gonna just break my Switch with a hammer and then show everybody on Twitter and be like, I don't know, I dropped my Switch.
[302:50.00]I fucking shattered.
[302:51.42]I have to play Multiverses instead.
[302:56.09]Shield of the Mind's Eye.
[303:05.03]Stop closing my stuff!
[303:06.83]I want...
[303:19.02]Hot mic, hot mic.
[303:29.18]No, actually I'm happy.
[303:33.32]It's a micro boss.
[303:35.12]Micro boss!
[303:39.11]Finally, I unlocked the dodge roll.
[303:44.19]Oh my god, finally.
[303:59.84]Wait, did I have it the whole time?
[304:06.91]Flurry Rush.
[304:16.16]What?
[304:17.84]I didn't... That's new.
[304:22.60]Do a backflip to avoid enemy attacks and create an opening to strike back.
[304:29.98]Yeah, backpedal.
[304:32.74]I should probably not be using this.
[304:39.55]I hit the wrong button.
[304:40.47]I'm... Again, I'll say this again.
[304:42.43]I hate so badly that all the controllers... Across the consoles, the controllers are different.
[304:48.47]Like, I'm pressing where B is on Xbox.
[304:52.05]And B is... Like, I wish it was just universal.
[305:06.38]Button law.
[305:07.30]Yeah, button rant.
[305:08.04]I know.
[305:08.30]That's what I'm saying.
[305:12.62]It should be... You know what I'm saying?
[305:21.84]Wait, I can parry at the right time?
[305:23.15]Well, I need a shield equipped, first of all.
[305:37.73]Why am I forgetting how to play?
[305:38.73]Okay.
[305:39.97]Oh, it's because... Okay, right, right, right, right, right.
[305:41.41]Because I have this equipped.
[305:57.73]Am I a man or am I a muppet?
[305:59.93]A muppet of a man.
[306:11.74]Where's my inventory?
[306:12.40]Ugh.
[306:16.44]Ugh!
[306:16.56]Something's running out of my mouth.
[306:34.21]Guardian sword?
[306:35.47]Oh, hell yeah.
[306:35.97]I'm going to store this for like 10 hours.
[307:06.93]I'm chewing my lip off camera.
[307:08.09]I'm sorry.
[307:12.02]Ooh.
[307:30.81]Drop it.
[307:48.21]Pretty cool looking.
[307:57.12]Pretty sweet.
[307:57.50]You guys pumped up?
[308:04.52]Get pumped!
[308:08.74]Get pumped up!
[308:10.79]Okay, opal.
[308:13.17]A valuable ore.
[308:13.89]Yep, yep, yep.
[308:29.10]Only one more and I can do something.
[308:35.97]Actually, don't get pumped up.
[308:36.81]It's 930 Pacific.
[308:38.53]It's pretty late.
[308:41.07]Chill out.
[308:42.57]I'm going to stream for a little while.
[308:43.71]At least another hour or two, maybe.
[308:49.66]Some mega gaming weekend.
[308:56.25]I think I'm going to stop playing during Omega Gaming Weekend.
[308:58.88]I'm not even going to think it's going to be a five-hour stream on Omega Sunday.
[309:18.56]ResidentSleeper, just relax.
[309:19.72]Just chill.
[309:20.52]Just chill out.
[309:21.06]It's all good.
[309:24.06]Just chill.
[309:30.75]Mommy's hiding, but I'll find her.
[309:32.01]Okay.
[309:49.50]I just skipped all the dialog.
[309:57.63]A man!
[310:00.19]Hmm?
[310:03.34]You have a Sheikah Slate?
[310:05.75]Could you be the hero my grandmother told me about?
[310:08.15]What was his name?
[310:12.65]Arnold.
[310:13.50]It's not what I forgot.
[310:14.96]It's bad.
[310:16.06]But whatever.
[310:17.50]My name is Paya.
[310:21.14]It's a weird one tonight.
[310:22.01]I'm sorry.
[310:29.92]My grandmother's been awaiting your return ever since I was little.
[310:33.84]Please hurry.
[310:38.48]It's me.
[310:39.42]Biggest fan of the Nintendo Switch here.
[310:41.28]To save the world.
[310:43.46]You're finally awake.
[310:49.23]I'm holding a lot of shit.
[311:20.85]Yeah, of course, man.
[311:21.65]I hit up all the swag spots at the convention.
[311:28.27]I got the God of War bow.
[311:30.81]Legend of Zelda sword.
[311:32.10]The Hearthstone card pack trinket.
[311:37.02]Oh, man, I hit up every booth.
[311:56.68]I don't have any memory.
[312:00.86]Dearest Link, please come a bit closer.
[312:07.44]Max level Redditor.
[312:19.09]A hundred years ago, the kingdom of Hyrule was destroyed.
[312:24.65]After you fell, Princess Zelda's final wish was to place you in a... Wait, so I lost?
[312:31.15]Really?
[312:31.47]And then alone she went to face Ganon.
[312:42.78]She entrusted me with some words she wished to say to you.
[312:45.62]I've been waiting a hundred years to deliver the princess's message.
[312:50.79]What is it?
[312:52.57]However, these words which the princess risked her life to leave you, well, if you are to hear them, you must be prepared to risk your life as well.
[313:03.72]I'm afraid that burden may be too much to bear while you are still without your memories.
[313:08.48]I leave the choice to you.
[313:10.10]When you feel you are ready to receive the princess's message, return to me.
[313:23.22]What are they?
[313:26.00]Not a memory to your name, yet you are... as intent as ever to charge forward with only courage and justice on your side.
[313:34.00]You have not changed a bit.
[313:35.40]Once a hero, always a hero.
[313:40.53]Very well.
[313:41.79]Here we go.
[313:45.19]He's gonna tell us everything.
[313:50.37]Long ago...
[314:41.02]What are the words?
[314:42.94]What's the secret sentence?
[315:34.80]Those are the things that I was fighting the shoot lasers?
[315:54.44]Where's my little fairy friend?
[315:58.54]The one that- the one with the Elmo voice.
[316:38.06]Music's pretty, uh... pretty pog.
[317:12.90]Okay.
[317:14.00]We strove to follow the lead of our ancestors of ten thousand years prior.
[317:23.00]Okay.
[317:25.00]But in the end, despite our best efforts and careful planning, we underestimated his power.
[317:33.00]In order to avoid making that great mistake again, the princess left you these words.
[317:44.57]Free the four divine beasts, is what she said?
[317:54.25]What the heck?
[317:56.36]Perked up a little bit on that one.
[318:05.60]The four divine beasts are the ancient Sheikah weapons wielded by the four champions who Ganon defeated.
[318:13.35]Vah Radania, controlled by Daruk of the Gorons.
[318:19.25]The Divine Beast of Vah Medoh, controlled by Revali of the Rito.
[318:24.83]The Divine Beast Vah Ruta, controlled by Mipha of the Zora.
[318:29.19]And the Divine Beast Vah Naboris, controlled by Urbosa of the Gerudo.
[318:36.80]Extremely ill-advised to face Ganon without the power of the Divine Beast to help you.
[318:41.20]You must infiltrate the Divine Beasts that were stolen away by Ganon a hundred years ago and bring them back to our side.
[318:46.89]Or, hold the left trigger and step forward.
[318:49.71]Hold left trigger, step forward, and teleport across the entire game and kill the final boss in one swing.
[318:59.62]And beat the game in four minutes.
[319:02.30]More information about these divine beasts can be found by locating the four races scattered across Hyrule.
[319:09.28]Oh my goodness, this was big.
[319:17.09]Dude, you want a hit of my jewel pod?
[319:19.27]Oh, bro, yeah, let me see.
[319:21.09]You got a hit of it, man.
[319:22.19]Thanks, dude.
[319:23.65]Jewel pod, alright.
[319:24.83]Cool, this thing here.
[319:30.05]That's on the ground.
[319:31.59]Don't stop doing that.
[319:34.59]Come on, Gwen.
[319:35.53]Get out of your mind.
[319:36.87]Cut that out.
[319:42.31]The device Princess Zelda left you is your guide and also your memory.
[319:47.09]Now, let's see.
[319:49.37]Someone at the research lab in Hatino Village might be able to help you.
[319:53.86]Where's that?
[319:54.28]Oh.
[320:00.08]Across the whole world.
[320:03.24]One of the very few places that avoided suffering significant damage during the Great Calamity.
[320:06.49]A lot of quests.
[320:15.79]Get Mario Kart installed on that thing.
[320:20.74]It's Freddy Dredd's birthday.
[320:22.00]Happy birthday, Freddy Dredd!
[320:23.30]What's up?
[320:41.15]Uh, hey.
[320:43.23]Oh, sorry.
[320:44.05]Hold on.
[320:44.53]I got stuck on the door.
[320:46.17]I got all this swag.
[320:47.37]Sorry.
[320:47.77]Should I talk?
[320:50.93]I will.
[321:14.36]Read the book by the door.
[321:17.14]Journal of various worries.
[321:20.88]Well, my wife left me today.
[321:22.26]The last thing she said to me was, what's more important, the cuckoos or me?
[321:27.81]I chose the cuckoos.
[321:30.56]Painter, unfamiliar to any of us, has arrived in the village.
[321:34.02]He claims he is searching for the Great Fairy's Fountain, but that's near where the village's spirit protector resides.
[321:41.03]We must make sure the outsider doesn't learn of the location of the fountain.
[321:45.11]Or the two shrines near it.
[321:46.37]Okay.
[321:49.71]That new guy in town looks like he really knows how to tune a bow.
[321:52.43]Hope he comes by and knocks an arrow for me.
[321:55.35]It's been way too long.
[322:03.75]Who's gonna read this?
[322:07.27]Alright, let's check.
[322:07.91]Where's the... I want another shrine.
[322:09.11]Okay.
[322:15.62]We need to protect Lady Impa.
[322:21.80]Technology became the key to sealing Ganon away during the Great Calamity some 10,000 years ago.
[322:26.97]Okay.
[322:29.97]Okay.
[322:33.76]OK.
[322:41.18]OK.
[322:45.71]OK.
[322:45.87]Alright.
[322:48.63]OK.
[323:08.47]What?
[323:12.40]What?
[323:15.81]Goat butter?
[323:18.73]Ugh, goat cheese is so gross.
[323:20.30]Goat cheese is fucking vile, I- honest to god I feel like everybody that eats- people pretend to like goat cheese.
[323:25.00]You pretend to like it.
[323:28.00]I'm- I'm so serious I will die on this hill.
[323:31.00]Goat cheese does not- it tastes like dirt.
[323:33.80]It tastes like dirt.
[323:35.00]It tastes like dirt from the ground.
[323:37.50]I swear to god, people pretend to like goat cheese, they don't actually like it, they just like- oh mmm!
[323:43.00]Oh, goat cheese is on that, mmm!
[323:44.20]No you don't actually- I know you don't like it.
[323:46.00]It tastes like dirt.
[323:48.58]It tastes like dirt.
[323:49.85]It's fucking- I- I hate it.
[323:51.50]It's one of my least favorite things in the world.
[323:58.01]It... goat cheese is one of those things that overpowers every single thing on the plate.
[324:06.54]It is unbearable.
[324:08.50]If there's goat cheese on something, all you're gonna taste is goat cheese.
[324:12.44]It's just gonna be that like... blegh, like dirt, like rotten dirt taste.
[324:18.13]Oh my god, it's so awful.
[324:25.29]That's an incredibly wrong opinion.
[324:27.53]I'm- I'm sorry, goat cheese is fucking filthy.
[324:29.97]I hate it more than anything.
[324:32.17]That's a rare Jerma L.
[324:32.80]No, it's- it's a- it's a common Jerma win!
[324:38.90]Get a poll going, I want to know.
[324:42.04]I want to know how many people here actually like goat cheese.
[324:45.12]Come on.
[324:47.36]Well, yeah, pile it up on a cracker then, yeah.
[324:49.93]Oh yeah, goat cheese, yeah!
[324:52.74]Oh, goat cheese, bro.
[324:54.24]I love it, ugh!
[324:56.76]Oh, dude, I would, I'll eat a ton of it on a cracker.
[324:58.86]Of course I will, blegh!
[325:01.63]Yeah, right.
[325:04.53]Goat cheese, yes or no?
[325:11.81]Feta is not goat cheese.
[325:13.53]It is not.
[325:14.17]Feta, is not goat cheese.
[325:16.01]Feta is not goat cheese!
[325:17.40]I'm sorry!
[325:17.92]That's incorrect!
[325:24.88]Feta is not goat cheese, incorrect!
[325:27.20]Feta is not goat cheese, incorrect.
[325:33.88]Jerma L.
[325:34.80]Absolute Jerma L, for real.
[325:41.24]We do this every time.
[325:42.48]I'm just telling you right now, I cannot believe people like that.
[325:48.52]What's the poll at?
[325:52.97]Un-fucking-believable.
[325:59.15]I cannot believe that half of you like goat cheese.
[326:01.77]There's no way.
[326:04.01]I don't find that to be possible.
[326:07.33]No way.
[326:10.84]I must be one of those people that has the piece of DNA in my body... where, when you eat cilantro, it's like you're eating soap and you want to throw up.
[326:26.53]If goat cheese is in something, it ruins the entire dish.
[326:29.59]It's so awful!
[326:31.25]It's so awful.
[326:33.47]No way!
[326:34.21]I'm shocked that this 51% think goat cheese is good.
[326:37.69]It is... It is like, I feel like I'm eating paint.
[326:48.97]You eat McDonald's, L take.
[326:53.09]Yeah, just wait till McDonald's comes out with a burger with the goat cheese on it.
[326:56.03]I swear to God, it'll probably happen soon.
[326:59.51]Oh, the McDonald's?
[327:01.03]Uh, the McDonald's, uh, fucking... S- uh- You know, burger with uh- goat cheese spread.
[327:09.00]Whatever- aioli! 
[327:10.07]Yeah, its, you know what I mean?
[327:12.82]It's happening.
[327:15.40]Yeah, just wait for the cilantro goat cheese fucking... shit burger.
[327:23.84]Good bit.
[327:24.40]I couldn't think of anything to say.
[327:25.68]I just, I hate goat cheese.
[327:27.80]It sucks every time it's on anything.
[327:30.74]You eat McDonald's.
[327:31.52]McDonald's is fucking delicious.
[327:43.92]Oh, I hate it.
[327:47.00]Ugh.
[327:48.43]I just think of the way that it feels when you eat a piece of goat cheese.
[327:52.64]It's like poison.
[327:55.78]Listen, I'll move on in a second, I promise.
[327:57.82]I'll move on in a second, I promise.
[328:02.72]This is really important.
[328:05.22]If it wasn't so powerful...
[328:08.74]So you know when you take a bite of food and it takes a second.
[328:11.26]It's like, oh, I'm gonna take a bite of this, whatever's on it.
[328:13.51]There's tomato, there's lettuce, onion, peppers, meat, turkey, cheese, doesn't matter.
[328:19.41]When you take a bite of food, it takes a second.
[328:21.62]It's like, ooh, okay, here are the flavors.
[328:24.84]That's the tomato I can taste that that's what beef tastes like that's what chicken tastes like goat cheese is this immediate immediate like Flavor it's it's like right when it touches your lip.
[328:38.77]It's just like oh, what's on this?
[328:40.54]Go cheese!
[328:41.30]Go!
[328:41.78]It's like, it's immediately, it's just so powerful, and it hits, it's so strong.
[328:47.37]It's like, oh, it's like grinding up a fucking weed, and just like, oh man, what's that?
[328:52.01]Oh my god, okay, that's, that's very heavy.
[328:56.15]It's, I, whatever.
[329:00.34]Go cheese is the ground-up pot version of cheese.
[329:03.60]It just stinks, and it tastes, it just
[329:13.93]Yeah, yeah, we got some mods in here that know what they're talking about.
[329:16.43]It takes me out of every dish.
[329:17.97]Because the second that the goat cheese hits, it just paints over everything else.
[329:25.30]Okay, well, I don't want to buy any of this.
[329:35.86]Bro, you literally drank urine.
[329:41.02]When did I drink piss on stream?
[329:46.14]When did I drink pee?
[329:47.72]I drank pee on stream.
[329:50.12]When?
[329:56.24]He doesn't remember.
[330:01.71]When did I drink pee?
[330:09.35]It was the pee drinking stream event.
[330:14.49]Oh, right, right, right.
[330:17.81]That's for an event, though.
[330:24.18]I remember, yeah, I remember.
[330:25.26]I was trying to see if I could be my own water filter, right?
[330:29.02]I thought that, like, I could filter out shit and drink the pee and stuff, and it was cleaning, essentially.
[330:33.87]I was drinking pee because I was trying to be my own filter.
[330:37.89]My own water filter.
[330:40.25]Oh, speaking of water filters, this is weird.
[330:41.83]Uh, I was gonna tweet this.
[330:43.97]But I didn't, because it was kind of odd.
[330:45.92]Maybe I'll put the picture up here.
[330:47.80]So, I got these water quality test strips.
[330:51.68]Just to test the water.
[330:52.70]It's like, oh, 16 in 1 test strips.
[330:54.98]Uh, so I pissed on one.
[330:57.68]For a joke.
[331:00.77]And to see, like, what my, like, fucking vitamin levels were.
[331:06.15]And, um, it was kind of fucked up.
[331:08.27]There was a shitload of lead in my piss.
[331:11.26]Is that bad?
[331:11.88]I just, like, I pissed on one and I just, like, shook it and I was like, what?
[331:17.11]And there was a shitload of lead.
[331:18.37]The lead indicator was really high.
[331:21.15]Is that bad?
[331:23.59]Is that actually bad?
[331:24.47]Like, hold on.
[331:25.19]Should I put the picture up?
[331:26.79]I actually might not be able to get it.
[331:31.82]Ask a doctor.
[331:37.00]That explains a lot.
[331:39.30]That explains a lot.
[331:40.04]No, it doesn't.
[331:40.76]Shut up.
[331:41.78]Get out of here.
[331:45.58]I, I actually, it was bright red and bright red was like you have a bunch of lead in your piss.
[331:51.35]No, but it's not, it's not a, hold on.
[331:53.45]It's not a piss test.
[331:54.77]It was a water quality test where you dunk it in like whatever your water is and then you read it.
[332:00.21]It's probably not accurate, right?
[332:08.23]No, the piss wasn't red.
[332:09.41]I think it's the saline.
[332:19.26]No, you guys have fucking up this whole story.
[332:22.84]I bought water quality- Okay, we're playing a game of telephone, and I'm the only one talking.
[332:29.14]How are you guys misconstruing this?
[332:31.30]I got water quality test strips.
[332:34.97]I peed on one.
[332:37.44]The one that I pissed on said there was lead.
[332:39.52]It was huge, bright red, like alarm lead.
[332:42.79]Hold on.
[333:00.44]Hold on.
[333:02.64]Give me a second.
[333:05.32]We'll go over this.
[333:18.09]One sec.
[333:18.51]Alright, hold on.
[333:19.21]Actually, give me one second.
[333:24.81]Alright, let me turn off my camera and turn this off.
[333:27.35]This is weird.
[333:30.72]Is this weird that I'm doing this and showing this to you?
[333:38.20]Probably.
[333:38.64]Hold on.
[333:44.20]I need to, like, upload them.
[333:45.41]Hold on.
[333:54.68]Is there any piss in the image?
[333:56.04]No.
[333:57.69]There's no piss in the image.
[333:58.63]Alright, I got them uploaded.
[334:05.85]And by uploaded, that means... Okay.
[334:08.59]Alright, hold on.
[334:12.05]Okay.
[334:15.49]Wait, I'm being told not to do this.
[334:17.65]Is this TOS?
[334:18.77]It is piss on this.
[334:20.61]Wait, wait, don't show, don't show.
[334:21.75]It's wet with piss.
[334:22.87]Is that TOS?
[334:24.27]Fuck.
[334:26.08]Alright, yeah, I can't show this.
[334:33.00]Yeah, actually, I definitely can't show this.
[334:34.78]There's, like, piss all over it.
[334:35.88]Yeah, never mind.
[334:46.45]Blur it out?!
[334:54.23]You should then tweet it then.
[334:55.69]Well, I get banned on Twitch if I tweet out a picture of something that I pissed on.
[334:59.55]I don't know.
[335:02.17]I'm concerned about that.
[335:05.18]That's freaking me out.
[335:09.18]Anyways, maybe I'll tweet it.
[335:10.98]Maybe I'll tweet it later.
[335:13.94]Draw a diagram.
[335:17.17]Show us.
[335:17.47]You're a coward.
[335:19.01]I'm a guy that wants to keep his Twitch channel intact.
[335:24.98]Maybe I'll ask somebody at Twitch.
[335:27.64]That's kind of a weird email.
[335:29.42]Hey, I pissed on like a water quality test strip and it's just pee all over the image.
[335:33.02]Can I show like a piss thing that I did?
[335:37.23]And by the way, take a look at the fucking Twitch servers.
[335:38.87]If you could.
[335:47.91]But yeah, no, I pissed on one.
[335:48.90]For real.
[335:51.72]And it said that my lead was off the charts.
[335:58.89]I need to.
[335:59.19]Yeah, where's that fountain?
[336:02.11]Is the fountain right?
[336:05.37]What's this?
[336:08.11]Dude, shut up.
[336:08.55]This is gross.
[336:18.08]It's it's heart container.
[336:27.78]That's definitely something to worry about.
[336:28.82]I mean, I'm kind of fucking around because... I have had my piss tested from a doctor within the last month or two.
[336:39.33]You know, right?
[336:39.89]Like, I peed into a cup in the last month.
[336:46.37]By the way, my water has been tested.
[336:47.91]There's no lead in it.
[336:49.27]That's why I got the strips.
[336:56.96]Nice.
[337:11.93]Okay, where's that fountain?
[337:14.77]Do they test it for lead?
[337:15.93]I don't know, man.
[337:17.81]I mean, there's no source of lead that I'm being exposed to.
[337:23.96]My water's been tested, there's no lead.
[337:27.78]Oh, we got a raid from Point Crow!
[337:30.74]Thanks, Point Crow.
[337:34.30]Welcome, everybody.
[337:35.66]But I don't know, do they test your piss for lead?
[337:44.30]No, thanks a lot, Poincro.
[337:49.76]If you're just joining us, I pissed on a water quality test strip.
[337:55.35]Just for a joke, for fun.
[337:56.73]I just thought it would be funny.
[337:58.37]And it turns out there's a shitload of lead in my pee.
[338:01.95]I don't know if it's a false positive or I don't know what it means.
[338:05.15]But... It's alright.
[338:10.37]Alright, can I cook?
[338:16.08]Alright, so this is a... Alright, this and monster parts.
[338:20.38]Do I have any monster parts?
[338:21.24]Yes.
[338:22.40]Alright, so this will give me a cool potion, right?
[338:31.22]What?
[338:36.08]I thought it said... It heightens your senses so you can move about... Oh, I thought...
[338:44.62]I thought it meant it was like a sneak potion or something.
[338:48.22]Let's make some apples.
[338:48.98]Do you have the 1987 Garfield mug?
[339:05.07]It could be related to lead.
[339:21.98]No, I don't have the 1987 Garfield mug that has lead paint.
[339:27.38]Is that real?
[339:33.00]Yeah, somebody just said, dude, those things are tested for water, not urine.
[339:36.62]You're fine.
[339:40.04]Imagine going to the doctor and being like, hey, doc!
[339:44.49]Yeah, I just like I'm just coming in today in urgent care because I see I peed on a water test strip as a joke.
[339:51.17]And here I brought it in, see?
[339:53.29]And it says I got lead in my pee.
[339:58.59]I'm just thinking maybe I could get like a real lead test.
[340:03.62]That's when you get one of these.
[340:10.90]Okay, sure, we'll test it for lead.
[340:14.56]Jesus.
[340:16.06]And then he's like, and he turns around and he closes the door fucking hard behind him.
[340:22.50]He closes the door fucking hard.
[340:24.74]He's like, Alright, where's the... They're getting big.
[340:40.83]Ooh, this is cool.
[340:44.55]Where's the fountain?
[340:46.54]There's two shrines in the fountain.
[340:50.98]I gotta go so far away.
[340:51.84]Where's the fountain?
[340:55.00]Fountain.
[340:55.80]Fountain.
[340:56.42]Store?
[340:57.32]Inn?
[340:57.50]Ooh!
[341:00.68]I'm gonna go there.
[341:01.14]Maybe I can get this stupid Nintendo Switch shirt off.
[341:14.55]I mean, it's not stupid.
[341:15.41]Switch is a great console.
[341:18.63]What do you got?
[341:25.52]God, goat cheese is so disgusting.
[341:32.64]Okay.
[341:33.66]The Clary Collection?
[341:35.24]Okay.
[341:42.77]I want to... How do I buy it?
[341:45.61]Can I just walk up to it?
[341:48.69]Ooh, hood.
[341:49.17]I only have 17 bucks.
[341:53.43]What can I sell?
[342:07.74]Don't really have anything.
[342:08.32]I can't really sell anything.
[342:10.30]I could sell some opals and shit, right?
[342:15.13]You just don't like anything that doesn't have the most basic flavor profile.
[342:17.71]I love fish.
[342:18.51]I love salmon, bass, trout.
[342:23.08]There's a lot of basic flavor profiles.
[342:26.76]I'm a huge fan of tuna fish.
[342:30.48]I got that tuna steak.
[342:32.57]Is it basic?
[342:33.29]How basic is like a sea bass flavor?
[342:35.77]What are you talking about?
[342:36.45]I actually hate sea bass.
[342:38.07]I'm just pretending.
[342:40.01]I love tuna though.
[342:45.72]I can't afford anything.
[342:52.47]Basic flavor profiles.
[342:53.63]No, I'm sorry.
[342:54.47]I just don't think that like, hey, this flavor profile is crazy and weird.
[342:58.36]Therefore, I should eat it.
[343:02.54]You have the diet of a brown bear.
[343:11.58]And... One of the strongest, most feared creatures on the planet.
[343:18.90]Hyper intelligent, hyper strong.
[343:21.46]Can... Yeah.
[343:23.74]What's your problem then?
[343:26.09]Who eats goat cheese?
[343:29.35]Goat cheese?
[343:32.51]Name me an animal in Animal Kingdom that eats goat cheese.
[343:35.77]And how strong are they?
[343:41.74]Oh, the bear with the... Yeah, the bear with the fuckin' monocle with his goat cheese and caviar.
[343:46.43]Oh, yes!
[343:47.53]Oh!
[343:48.25]Mmm!
[343:48.57]What are you talking about?
[343:50.43]I eat fuckin' meat!
[343:54.37]And potatoes!
[343:56.29]And lettuce and fuckin' gravy!
[344:03.34]Spinach!
[344:05.32]And radishes!
[344:08.20]And I'm alive!
[344:09.02]And I'm human!
[344:11.35]I like to eat too.
[344:13.98]And I like to have children.
[344:33.08]I'm here and I'm coming.
[344:35.55]I'm here and I'm coming.
[344:43.15]It's all the gems.
[344:43.87]I need to play the game.
[344:45.99]Can I please play the game for at least 10 minutes?
[344:53.07]Somebody help me!
[344:53.83]Where's the fountain?
[345:05.37]What's happening?
[345:09.42]What's happening?
[345:11.74]I'll fucking kill every last one of you!
[345:21.09]So... What are you painting?
[345:34.84]Great- I hear there's a great fairy fountain somewhere near this village.
[345:38.62]I hear it's breath- Where is it then?
[345:45.18]If it was an outsider like me to begin.
[345:48.41]Just all non-sequiturs the last hour.
[345:51.43]Somebody help.
[345:56.29]I'm stuck in non-sequitur Andy.
[345:58.29]Like, I gotta get out of this.
[346:04.88]Near the village.
[346:09.42]It's probably over here.
[346:17.68]Wasn't the shrine... Where's my horse?
[346:20.42]It's the lead.
[346:32.33]And I eat lead too!
[346:42.58]Sir, Sir Link.
[346:44.70]My cuckoos.
[346:46.49]My precious cuckoos.
[346:47.37]They haven't come home yet.
[346:49.43]Okay.
[346:54.07]What do I do?
[346:57.23]I'm not doing that.
[346:57.91]I don't care.
[346:58.41]I'm going to get like $50.
[346:59.05]I don't want it.
[347:02.57]It's the 1987 Garfield mug.
[347:06.38]Pass the shrine up the hill in the forest.
[347:08.34]Thank you.
[347:11.65]Pass the shrine up the hill in the forest.
[347:15.30]So you mean, like, in here?
[347:17.06]You're the man.
[347:19.96]You're the man, thanks.
[347:22.42]You're the man, dude.
[347:26.84]You're the man.
[347:27.44]Up here?
[347:40.44]Is there any backseat enforcement?
[347:42.80]I have to get out of this non-sequitur Andy thing.
[347:47.87]Just tell me where to go.
[347:49.65]This horse doesn't want to walk in the right direction.
[348:04.60]Am I going the right way?
[348:12.22]Up here into the left.
[348:19.27]The horse controls are so ridiculous.
[348:21.17]They're so hard.
[348:21.79]It's gonna take a lot of getting used to.
[348:24.15]You can't turn.
[348:24.87]It's...
[348:43.06]Other way, other way up the hill.
[348:44.98]You mean up here?
[348:49.48]No!
[348:50.52]Wrong way.
[348:51.94]No, wrong way.
[348:52.74]I have to go northeast.
[349:06.67]Okay.
[349:11.19]So you mean up this way.
[349:20.18]Yes.
[349:20.84]Thanks.
[349:21.40]Okay, so pass the shrine up the hill.
[349:35.16]The hill.
[349:49.32]Up this hill.
[349:50.93]I'm not getting any beeps.
[349:57.09]Please don't fall off.
[350:04.48]We're in trouble.
[350:05.30]How do I solve this?
[350:05.92]How do I fix this?
[350:07.66]Is there a thing I can eat that takes me to the last bonfire?
[350:10.33]How do I fix this?
[350:11.71]Into the forest?
[350:15.16]Oh, shit.
[350:18.70]Oh, this is bad.
[350:19.98]This is bad.
[350:20.90]This is bad.
[350:21.93]This is bad.
[350:22.53]This is bad.
[350:23.95]This is bad.
[350:25.61]Um, I think we're in trouble.
[350:27.81]I think we're in trouble.
[350:39.13]Is the horse still alive?
[350:40.07]Is the horse still alive?
[350:42.15]Please tell me the horse is still alive.
[350:44.75]Is the horse going to be alive?
[350:45.75]I have to get off the horse.
[350:52.37]The horse sucks.
[350:53.59]I can't control it.
[350:54.53]Okay.
[350:56.67]The forest.
[350:59.46]Past here.
[351:04.98]Up this way.
[351:05.62]Okay.
[351:14.50]Over here.
[351:18.84]Here's a forest.
[351:22.27]I'm getting off the horse.
[351:23.07]I can't.
[351:23.71]I go slower than just running.
[351:27.01]Okay.
[351:36.90]Ooh, found it.
[351:43.52]So what do we got here?
[351:44.76]Okay.
[351:48.68]There's a ball somewhere.
[352:01.53]Legendary owl.
[352:08.39]Blue nightshade?
[352:09.41]Coke with a do.
[352:10.77]Increase your stealth.
[352:11.73]Cool.
[352:21.16]Relax.
[352:26.08]Okay.
[352:26.56]I'm not getting any beeps from my thing.
[352:45.00]There are two shrines, like, down in the fountain.
[352:47.96]Under the fairy fountain.
[353:00.66]That one down there?
[353:01.36]Is that it right there?
[353:03.56]That's it right there, right?
[353:09.83]Yeah, that's it. ...
[353:32.74]Get a lot of stuff here.
[353:37.20]That's an auto.
[353:41.82]Endura carrot.
[353:44.02]Highly crunchy.
[353:49.36]Silent princess.
[353:51.26]Okay.
[353:53.26]A lot of materials over here.
[353:57.83]Can you catch the fairy?
[354:05.16]What is this?
[354:05.66]All I need is a hundred rupees!
[354:38.75]I don't have any.
[354:41.99]That is tragic.
[354:44.59]I need to mark this on the map.
[354:45.67]I'm going to say... Is it a person?
[354:55.25]Okay.
[355:01.89]Where is that shrine?
[355:10.54]Pay her.
[355:13.75]Sell the gems.
[355:14.51]I only have 17 rupees, guys.
[355:17.69]What are you talking about?
[355:29.46]I don't know if I can... I don't think I can do it.
[355:32.30]I don't think I can do it.
[355:36.23]I gotta head this way, though.
[355:37.85]I'm gonna fast travel to here.
[355:39.01]I'm gonna go this way.
[355:40.77]That feels like the safest place to go.
[355:45.19]You're a quitter.
[355:46.57]Sell everything.
[355:47.49]Sell stuff.
[355:48.23]Oh my goodness, fine.
[355:50.55]Is it worth it?
[355:52.75]Is it actually worth it?
[356:08.25]Where's the general store?
[356:12.59]I have a few opals I can sell.
[356:13.79]Okay.
[356:21.98]Uh, I'll sell... Two opals?
[356:31.46]Okay, 120.
[356:33.12]Now let's go back and give the rupees.
[356:44.93]Horses love apples and carrots.
[356:51.04]Yeah?
[356:52.42]Come over here.
[356:52.78]I'll give you a carrot.
[356:53.38]Carrot!
[357:00.59]Come get a carrot.
[357:02.65]Carrot.
[357:14.84]Here.
[357:23.44]You just... You took the... Oh, okay.
[357:25.08]Cool.
[357:25.50]You liked it.
[357:40.71]If you take it without permission, come back... Oh, I can't just take all these pumpkins?
[357:49.14]Alright, now I'm gonna go back to here.
[357:50.92]Uh-huh.
[357:53.17]So I gotta go past the shrine.
[357:54.55]Up here, right?
[357:56.69]Oh, oh.
[358:15.19]I'm just running.
[358:17.45]There's no point.
[358:18.45]The horse doesn't like me.
[358:21.17]Alright, so I'm going to go this way.
[358:25.55]I'm going to glide back over there and we'll pay it.
[358:27.16]Let's see.
[358:35.00]I'm hungry.
[358:35.44]What should I eat?
[358:39.79]We mentioned it before.
[358:40.51]Maybe...
[358:44.16]Might be a McDonald's kind of night.
[358:47.40]Kiss off all the goat cheese enjoyers.
[358:59.92]Goat cheese with a side of lead paint.
[359:01.66]Alright, here we go.
[359:13.82]I have 100 rupees for you.
[359:15.26]What are you going to do for me?
[359:17.26]Here you go.
[359:43.40]Is that a mistake?
[359:43.96]Okay.
[360:00.71]What a feeling.
[360:01.43]That first breath of fresh air after an eternity of decay is just so intoxicating.
[360:06.65]Thanks to you, I've been returned to my former glory.
[360:08.43]And as they say, one good turn deserves another.
[360:10.94]I can help you.
[360:13.15]Allow me to enhance your clothing.
[360:14.84]No, not this clothing!
[360:19.20]Don't enhance my Nintendo Switch t-shirt, please.
[360:25.00]No, I don't want you to.
[360:27.88]No, do not enhance the Switch shirt.
[360:35.00]Oh, I see you have a Nintendo Switch shirt.
[360:36.76]Yes, let's give that +2 defense so you can never take it off.
[360:44.09]Hyah!
[361:18.24]Are you wearing makeup?
[361:21.08]No, I have just this camera has filters on it.
[361:23.38]Alright, I'm going to go this way.
[361:32.93]We're going to get on the road.
[361:33.75]Is my horse around?
[361:39.56]Frank can't hear your call.
[361:41.72]Why not?
[361:46.98]Why?
[361:52.96]What are you, you got a quest for me now?
[361:56.30]Alright, actual gameplay coming up here.
[362:03.42]Interesting.
[362:10.45]I have to go.
[362:10.91]I want nothing to do with you.
[362:14.15]I have to play the game.
[362:15.41]I'm not doing like another side quest.
[362:23.53]I want to get my horse.
[362:27.06]Frank.
[362:45.37]Let's go, Frank.
[362:57.23]Get the fork.
[362:59.93]And go from here.
[363:07.78]Feed?
[363:08.14]I fed him a carrot already.
[363:10.62]Alright, here we go.
[363:13.33]Take it right here.
[363:14.03]See if we can find another shrine.
[363:16.85]That'd be pretty cool.
[363:39.90]Choo-choo jelly!
[363:40.76]Actually, the spears are my favorite weapons in this game right now.
[363:47.56]This thing is great.
[363:52.96]Forget about the swords.
[363:54.02]These are way better.
[363:54.70]Cool.
[364:12.19]I wanna find a shrine.
[364:13.03]It's my favorite part.
[364:18.38]Got ya.
[364:27.66]Watch out!
[364:32.58]There's a monster!
[364:36.06]Watch out!
[364:38.97]Have you already been to the Spring of Wisdom?
[364:41.29]It is known that Princess Zelda visited the Spring in prayer.
[364:43.29]I have a great deal of love and respect for her.
[364:45.31]Don't worry, I got it.
[364:59.52]That was close.
[365:19.48]See ya.
[365:58.19]The bombs are so good.
[366:04.89]What?
[366:30.40]Want more people over here?
[366:38.47]What the fuck, Jeremy?
[366:40.52]What the fuck are you doing?
[366:42.38]Why did you do that?
[366:43.32]I didn't want to press that fucking button.
[366:45.18]I'm actually pissed right now.
[366:47.36]I'm pissed.
[367:04.26]My god, that hurt.
[367:07.56]There we go.
[367:31.54]Man, that guy's hard.
[367:35.99]Soldier's shield.
[367:37.01]Cool.
[367:37.23]Is this thing open yet?
[367:43.40]No?
[368:03.77]Are they McDonald's?
[368:13.59]Are you guys feeling McDonald's?
[368:16.33]What about Wendy's, Burger King?
[368:18.35]What are you feeling?
[368:20.11]Opal?
[368:20.39]Nice.
[368:32.77]There's ruins over there, too.
[368:33.75]Um... You should get some goat cheese.
[368:59.14]No, I don't think so.
[369:02.80]Blinking up there.
[369:10.00]Okay.
[369:11.90]Cool.
[369:12.60]I'm gonna check the ruins.
[369:14.80]Right?
[369:15.20]I'm gonna check the ruins.
[369:16.60]Might be something there.
[369:20.20]Mcgoat cheese.
[369:39.13]Gonna come alive.
[369:39.71]Ooh, ancient spring.
[369:42.43]Ancient screw. ...
[370:10.58]Ooh, you dropped the claymore.
[370:11.98]Nice.

[370:18.69]Gyro.
[370:19.57]Gyro.
[370:19.91]Yeah, it's gyro.
[370:35.76]It's like gyro, right?
[370:37.18]Gyro?
[370:38.02]Gyro?
[370:38.22]It's not gyro.
[370:41.67]Everybody calls it... Ooh, that thing looks pretty good.
[370:51.30]Um... Um... I mean, these... Torch?

[371:35.48]I don't even know what that means, but it sounds cool.
[371:38.42]Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
[371:42.32]Oh man, I still got it.
[371:43.70]Even these many years later.
[371:44.64]I feel like there's something in here.
[372:09.56]Nope.
[372:10.26]Okay.
[372:20.74]Wild horses.
[372:21.34]I want the blue horse.
[372:39.48]Shit.
[373:18.80]Thank you.
[374:20.49]What?
[374:27.91]I don't think I'm not strong enough.
[374:29.21]I was soothing.
[374:29.75]I need more stamina.
[374:48.82]Come see Fort Hateno, I take it.
[374:50.84]That's right.
[374:53.24]It's worth seeing.
[374:54.20]Okay.
[374:57.24]Everyone's got to come and pay their respects at least once in life, right?
[375:01.50]Yeah, let's go.
[375:05.38]Ancient stuff.
[375:11.19]Should I be collecting as many of these as I can?
[375:13.79]Or is this a waste of time?
[375:20.58]Yes.
[375:20.84]Okay.
[375:22.54]So it's worth getting all these?
[375:31.14]Very worth it.
[375:31.68]Okay.
[375:39.16]That's a lot.
[375:41.20]They're extremely useful.
[375:42.58]Alright.
[375:43.76]Good to know.
[375:53.20]Okay.
[375:58.90]Did you get new clothes?
[375:59.70]I did not.
[376:01.74]I did not.
[376:05.58]Please, I'm begging you.
[376:06.37]Try to shield surf.
[376:09.71]Oh, there's another raid, too, from Automated.
[376:15.49]Thank you, Otto.
[376:17.55]I didn't see that, either.
[376:18.31]Probably talking about goat cheese and shit and pissing everybody off.
[376:23.97]Are you mad at me that I don't like goat cheese?
[376:25.27]I hope not.
[376:27.86]We can still be friends, right?
[376:29.68]Like, we can still be friends, right?
[376:33.50]Just kidding.
[376:33.94]I can be friends with somebody that eats fucking goat cheese.
[376:36.74]Yeah?
[376:37.12]You think that's possible for me?
[376:39.16]Nope.
[376:46.85]Alright, I need a tower.
[376:48.87]Or... This is far away.
[376:54.82]Cook those carrots.
[376:58.27]I should cook a lot of things that I have, right?
[377:05.69]Okay.
[377:06.31]Cook with it to increase your stealth.
[377:09.13]Like this?
[377:09.99]Can I do like this?
[377:16.67]What happens if I do that?
[377:19.41]Carrots and flowers.
[377:26.14]Fried wild greens.
[377:27.86]Cool.
[377:29.42]No!
[377:31.34]Oh.
[377:36.26]What if I do this?
[377:45.71]Sneaky fried wild greens.
[377:49.61]Cool.
[377:51.08]So wait.
[377:51.86]What if I do this?
[377:52.66]This would be interesting.
[377:56.41]Can I just make, like, a super huge potion?
[378:04.34]Oh, that's 10 minutes!
[378:06.78]Alright, that's cool.
[378:08.24]So, I get it.
[378:12.44]Very cool.
[378:14.78]So, if I do a mushroom and this, then I'll have food that heals me and gives me stealth.
[378:27.69]Alright.
[378:28.29]Sneaky steamed mushrooms.
[378:29.79]I got it.
[378:30.17]I get it.
[378:32.47]That's really cool.
[378:33.27]I like it.
[378:54.19]You don't like feta?
[378:54.91]I do like feta.
[378:56.13]Feta is not goat cheese.
[379:01.57]It has a completely different flavor profile.
[379:07.74]It's sheep.
[379:10.30]It's sheep cheese.
[379:11.82]A sheep is not a goat.
[379:14.88]A sheep is not a goat.
[379:16.30]What do we need?
[379:16.82]Do we need to go over the animals again?
[379:18.30]A is for alligator.
[379:20.26]B is for bear.
[379:22.60]S is for sheep.
[379:26.93]G is for goat.
[379:34.18]Are you playing on Switch or PC?
[379:58.70]This is not on PC.
[380:00.48]It's on Switch, right?
[380:02.60]Yeah, it's only on Nintendo.
[380:07.11]Point of interest?
[380:07.69]What's this?
[380:12.48]Only got hit once.
[380:13.14]Is it an emulator?
[380:31.79]Why aren't you using an emulator?
[380:47.11]Um... I can sleep in here?
[380:50.52]Is there a chest or anything?
[380:52.64]Woody's diary.
[380:54.58]Ancient text.
[380:56.94]When a dark light resides in the cursed statue's eyes, pierce its gaze to purge the seal from the shrine.
[381:02.32]Good to know.
[381:12.17]The reason to use an emulator is for 4k 60fps texture packs.
[381:32.98]Okay.
[381:35.56]Let me guess.
[381:36.92]You caught one of the great Dr. Callip's groundbreaking research and just had to meet him for yourself, huh?
[381:42.49]No, downtime, you never heard of me.
[381:43.61]I have not.
[381:52.39]Use an emulator.
[381:53.05]BatChest.
[381:55.45]I'm just playing the game on Switch.
[382:00.02]Okay.
[382:00.46]Dr. Calip, if you please.
[382:01.96]I didn't study my rear end off to be called Mr. Calip.
[382:07.64]Everyone forgets I'm a doctor for some reason.
[382:09.88]And since you asked, I'll inform you that I'm engaged in analyzing ancient texts.
[382:15.17]Having time for idle chit-chat.
[382:18.93]Okay.
[382:19.47]Okay.
[382:24.69]Okay.
[382:26.23]Okay.
[382:30.46]Doctor?
[382:30.84]Yeah.
[382:32.58]Dr. Gallop?
[382:35.16]Yeah.
[382:37.82]Okay.
[382:43.21]Sure.
[382:45.99]Cool.
[382:51.43]Mm-hmm.
[383:03.46]Who's he talking to?
[383:04.60]My mom.
[383:05.06]My mom's watching right now.
[383:06.08]I have her, you know, text her right here.
[383:09.12]My mom doesn't know how to use Twitch chat, so she chats, right, with text.
[383:16.36]She texts me and I use it as a chat.
[383:42.76]Eh, let's go.
[383:52.52]What's the last thing she said?
[383:55.70]Don't listen to them, sweetheart.
[383:57.76]McDonald's is delicious.
[383:59.19]We're a McDonald's family.
[384:01.27]All the way through.
[384:03.57]I never used to cook with goat cheese because it was disgusting.
[384:06.99]Cheddar cheese, where it's at.
[384:11.07]Love, Mom.
[384:11.67]Yeah.
[384:13.69]MonkaS.
[384:14.37]She said MonkaS like five times before that.
[384:15.95]I don't know what she meant.
[384:25.10]Yeah, they're like 30 to 40 minutes apart.
[384:27.38]Each one like six times.
[384:32.87]Okay, so, uh, yep.
[384:54.63]Dude, if I was an adventurer, I definitely would use a bow.
[385:02.75]100%.
[385:02.79]Okay.
[385:24.67]What, did you get attacked up close?
[385:28.97]Good luck.
[385:51.42]Aw shit, here we go.
[385:52.28]He's making noises.
[385:59.28]Uh, what is over here?
[385:59.92]Are you going to wrap this stream up?
[386:22.26]God damn it, I almost drowned.
[386:23.36]Okay.
[386:26.00]Uh, maybe like another half hour.
[386:27.96]I'm still good.
[386:35.00]Seven hours or so?
[386:35.90]Maybe seven and a half hours, something like that?
[386:49.00]You're addicted?
[386:50.90]It's a good- it's a fun game!
[386:53.10]It's genuinely a fun game, it's very nice.
[387:14.43]What was that?
[387:14.85]Oh, it's an acorn.
[387:19.32]You said that yesterday and I left and you streamed for another nine hours.
[387:24.26]Yeah, that was a rare occasion though.
[387:26.12]Where's the tower here?
[387:35.93]Oh, I'm just gonna keep wandering this way.
[387:42.15]Oh, hi.
[387:45.08]You should join the Yiga clan.
[387:48.46]You don't know?
[387:49.32]I mean, I do know.
[387:52.57]Brave group of warriors founded by Master Koga and dedicated to defending a hero throughout long...
[388:33.44]Why?
[388:33.72]That didn't hit?
[388:49.27]Family Guy Death Pose.
[388:56.23]Should have just fought.
[389:00.23]That was weird.
[389:05.08]I thought I could just, boom, just blow them crazy and they fly and, you know, I guess you can't.
[389:11.59]Is that just a random occurrence?
[389:15.27]That's pretty cool.
[389:29.51]I just missed.
[389:30.49]Yeah, I felt like it could have hit, though.
[389:36.01]Run on top of it.
[389:52.48]Your skin suit looks accurate to a human today.
[389:56.32]Thanks.
[389:57.60]No, never mind.
[389:58.08]I'm not going to do that.
[389:58.78]Weird.
[390:29.29]Take.
[390:31.68]That was a bug.
[390:32.60]Ooh, hold on.
[390:33.84]Hell yeah.
[390:43.07]Amber.
[390:48.53]You should buy the broadcasting rights to Family Guy.
[390:53.59]Uh... that would be nice to hit up, um... Fox.
[390:57.00]And see you know the 10 to 25 million dollars I probably would need for like a month.
[391:14.00]Ooh!
[391:18.00]I can't carry any more melee weapons?
[391:25.41]I have a lot of these claymores.
[391:26.45]I'll just get rid of it.
[391:30.79]That thing's 18 damage?
[391:32.09]16 damage?
[391:32.52]Shit.
[392:10.34]The backswing hit me and killed me in one hit.
[392:16.30]Guides.
[392:31.03]Who's that?
[392:31.41]Anybody on a horse?
[393:02.81]Oh my goodness, there's a lot of them.
[393:06.81]What are they all attacking?
[393:14.50]Holy shit, that guy went... I'm doing Dark Souls controls.
[393:26.77]I keep on hitting right stick to try to lock on.
[394:10.36]These guys are way higher level than me.
[394:14.16]Oh my god, I'm just fucking running.
[394:15.78]What's the point?
[394:17.55]Help?
[394:19.26]Wait, what's happening?
[394:21.76]Is there stuff on your cart?
[394:23.14]Do you have stuff on your cart?
[394:26.24]What the fuck is going on?
[394:32.20]This isn't supposed to be hard?
[394:33.36]You die in one swing!
[394:34.66]What do you mean it's not hard?
[394:35.78]I die in one hit with my Nintendo Switch polyester t-shirt on.
[394:50.98]Oh, he took care of it.
[394:51.96]No, he didn't.
[395:14.71]They telegraph for two seconds?
[395:16.77]I'm... Dude, I died in one hit!
[395:21.70]This character sucks!
[395:27.75]I'm trying to dodge it and do the fucking parry thing!
[395:42.55]I'm trying to do the flurry dodge, whatever.
[395:46.57]I have a better idea.
[395:49.59]Go put on something that is made out of anything besides... Like something that I got at fucking Old Navy.
[395:55.92]Okay, goodbye.
[396:47.60]Let's go!
[397:03.59]Get the tower.
[397:06.57]Yeah, where is it?
[397:07.55]I was trying to look.
[397:10.73]Wait, let me climb up here and see if I can see it from up here.
[397:16.25]Oh, okay.
[397:32.16]I'm not going to glide.
[397:32.92]I would not have made it.
[397:42.81]Do you enjoy the scenery?
[397:44.11]It's beautiful.
[397:47.89]The 30 FPS is not a big deal.
[397:50.03]It's doable, it's workable, it's fine.
[397:51.39]I think it's fine.
[398:00.24]Who's the sniff guy?
[398:23.56]mop
[398:52.34]That slide.
[398:58.68]That guy was a lot scarier than he... Okay.
[399:20.60]Moblin Fang?
[399:23.92]Moblin Horn?
[399:25.00]Okay, Moblin.
[399:25.78]I don't... Nah, I don't care.
[399:52.96]ink got you oh you have a weapon
[400:28.29]They let him No, no, no!
[400:59.84]OK.
[401:18.03]I can definitely do it.
[401:18.73]Just stop jumping.
[401:23.85]Hang out up here for a second.
[401:27.91]I should be able to stand on this, right?
[401:31.91]I don't have to go around.
[401:34.59]I bet you I can stand up here.
[401:37.05]Right there.
[401:37.39]Come on.
[402:07.41]I have to go all the way around.
[402:24.39]I just should have died.
[402:25.17]I probably would have ended up up there again.
[402:30.55]Alright, I think I can get this.
[402:31.89]Here we go.
[402:34.15]Don't do the jump thing.
[402:36.55]I'll be fine.
[402:44.40]Yeah, I can definitely make it from here.
[402:50.84]Oh my God, that's a lot.
[402:58.58]Oh shit, nice.
[403:09.01]OK, so from wait, hold on.
[403:11.07]So from here I should really stand on top of this.
[403:15.42]I can go up from here.
[403:26.03]I think I got it.
[403:26.87]Straight up.
[403:31.27]No jumping.
[403:35.52]We stand right up there.
[403:36.46]I just hope so.
[403:48.34]Right on his lip?
[403:51.20]I don't think so.
[403:51.84]Three sec.
[404:10.18]Alright, got my fucking gold, by the way.
[404:15.99]Sapphire.
[404:18.21]Amber, sapphire, rock salt.
[404:21.44]Pretty nice.
[404:24.02]Check this house.
[404:40.87]Oh, it's an enemy.
[404:52.94]Octoballoons.
[404:56.02]Got a bass, cool.
[405:07.68]Okay, let me get my bearings and see where I am.
[405:09.46]A little hut right here.
[405:14.42]I need to get back over there.
[405:15.90]Let me check the house.
[405:44.05]Ten arrows actually really useful Alright
[405:52.38]I'm so screwed though.
[405:53.60]I need to somehow get back up the whole mountain.
[406:02.13]What's this?
[406:07.03]I could probably teleport and then go again.
[406:08.65]What would this be for?
[406:21.50]What is this for?
[406:23.55]Wouldn't just be here for no reason.
[406:24.67]Do I have to set it back in the slot?
[406:47.28]Oh, I found another seed.
[406:50.61]The little guy's got no fear.
[407:20.77]I have to go all the way around, right?
[407:22.71]That sucks.
[407:28.42]Fuck.
[407:53.47]Wow, imagine dying to a mop.
[407:58.44]Alright, I gotta start using the better weapons.
[408:28.17]I need a shield.
[408:36.01]This thing is way better.
[408:48.68]What an actual item.
[408:51.60]It's not like the handle of a fridge.
[408:55.89]Or a tire iron.
[409:21.49]Pure offense, yeah.
[409:30.00]These guys... Do so much- the huge guys don't do that much damage!
[409:37.04]Those... the blue... um... trolls, whatever they are, they- they do so much damage.
[409:51.97]Where did I end up?
[409:53.55]Okay, let me just... Where's the horse?
[410:03.88]I'm just going up that way, and I'm gonna go turn the thing on.
[410:15.15]I'll come back and explore this later.
[410:16.39]I need armor.
[410:23.29]Dude, that did one quarter of a heart, not my entire health pool.
[410:42.26]Stupid.
[410:44.52]Alright, let's go.
[410:45.08]Wrap around and turn the thing on.
[410:52.69]Where is it?
[410:53.05]I lost it.
[410:53.57]These things tower over the whole horizon.
[410:57.93]Why can I not see it?
[410:58.59]Okay.
[411:02.13]So I gotta go around here.
[411:03.13]To the right.
[411:05.97]And just... I'm only going for that.
[411:07.86]And then when I get up there, I'm probably gonna call it.
[411:15.52]That's a solid seven hours.
[411:21.59]This is great though.
[411:22.35]This is a good game.
[411:24.11]We will definitely continue playing Breath of the Wild.
[411:46.16]Yeah, definitely.
[411:49.42]What's the average time to take to beat it?
[411:51.16]This could just turn into the Elden Ring, right?
[411:55.68]Where I just play it every other day or something like that.
[411:58.19]Probably like about 100 hours.
[412:12.66]Oh.
[412:18.22]Oh no!
[412:20.04]He threw a bomb!
[412:21.27]Okay, thank God it didn't directly hit me.
[412:35.86]Oh my God, get me the fuck out of here.
[412:43.01]That's a bow I don't... What's that bow?
[412:44.82]Krennic bow?
[412:45.38]Cool.
[413:28.09]Oppo.
[413:28.37]There's a chest over here too.
[413:53.89]How do I get up there?
[413:54.63]Can I climb the tree?
[414:13.42]No ladder.
[414:13.82]Does it glide from there?
[414:17.98]From the, yeah, from pretty far away.
[414:19.64]Uh, I'll go from the top.
[414:31.25]Makes more sense, right?
[414:46.15]Alright, what do you got in here?
[414:52.06]Ten arrows, I'll take it.
[414:52.92]Alright.
[414:56.12]Now we gotta go... That way.
[415:02.15]Jeez, how am I gonna... Hopefully I can get up here this way.
[415:10.93]Can you come to my birthday party?
[415:13.70]Um, I don't think I can come to your birthday party, but I can say happy birthday.
[415:17.05]Hope you have a good birthday.
[415:21.19]Whenever it is.
[415:21.71]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...
[416:14.07]Scary tree.
[416:21.01]Don't... If I died in the thorns... You could revoke my gaming license.
[416:25.56]Seriously.
[416:37.24]What's my opinion on Greek yogurt?
[416:39.80]Um... It's a...
[416:55.00]It sucks.
[416:56.92]I'm not a big fan.
[416:58.74]I think it's gross.
[417:02.98]Goats milk, goat cheese, you know.
[417:06.57]I'm not a big fan.
[417:15.77]I actually love Greek yogurt.
[417:20.45]I love yogurt in general.
[417:26.56]You know what I like bad?
[417:27.18]I like, um... I like Kefir.
[417:32.21]I did not do this right.
[417:33.29]Just don't move.
[417:41.29]Oh my... God, I landed right on my neck.
[417:53.14]I landed right on my neck.
[418:22.54]Almost there.
[418:28.46]You doing good?
[418:33.19]This game is just fun to play.
[418:39.11]Alright.
[418:44.33]Now we can jump.
[418:58.67]Let go, let go.
[418:59.47]That was bad.
[419:05.87]Do not jump.
[419:08.67]I need a coffee.
[419:10.83]I do not want to drink a coffee at 1130 at night.
[419:13.65]That would be a mistake.
[419:18.47]I had one like six, seven, wait, eight hours ago.
[419:28.61]How am I gonna get over this?
[419:59.85]Same exact fucking thing.
[420:02.72]Should I... I don't understand.
[420:03.94]Should I try the other side?
[420:04.72]I'm drinking one of these.
[420:20.69]Am I even going faster?
[420:21.51]Is it... I don't think... I'm not even going faster.
[420:43.65]What the fuck is going on?
[420:45.92]Link.
[420:52.74]Link!
[420:54.93]Link!
[420:57.49]Be on your guard.
[421:00.57]What's the hour of the blood moon?
[421:03.89]It's a good thing I'm a thousand feet above everything.
[421:07.01]I don't give a shit.
[421:07.71]Look at where I am.
[421:08.77]I'm protected up here.
[421:30.47]Why would I be concerned about that?
[421:31.61]I'm 2,000 feet above sea level.
[421:48.50]Okay, so I'm gonna go- I'm gonna do this.
[421:51.76]See if I can do this.
[421:52.38]Ready?
[422:06.19]Smart baby.
[422:11.69]Smart baby.
[422:26.68]I climbed this.
[422:30.40]No.
[423:10.07]Oh, here we go.
[423:11.63]I got it.
[423:23.37]We're good.
[423:45.20]Hooray.
[423:55.52]And that's where we're going to end the stream.
[424:00.73]First impression Breath of the Wild.
[424:03.67]It's pretty great.
[424:04.43]I like it.
[424:04.91]I think it's really fun.
[424:07.29]I definitely want to do some more shrines.
[424:08.58]I definitely want to do.
[424:09.18]I want to fight like the first boss.
[424:17.92]It's very engaging.
[424:18.64]There's a lot to do.
[424:24.18]And there it is.
[424:24.64]There's your Omega Gaming Weekend.
[424:28.30]It's kind of a regular stream here.
[424:30.96]And then a... Oh, nice.
[424:36.60]Okay.
[424:38.60]This map is huge.
[424:39.40]Are you going to stream tomorrow?
[424:44.90]I will not be streaming tomorrow, no.
[424:47.83]The next time the channel will be live, what is today's date?
[424:50.75]Today is Sunday.
[424:52.79]Sunday the... Sunday the 18th.
[424:57.91]This... Okay, here's what's gonna happen.
[425:00.67]I will be back on... Tuesday or Wednesday?
[425:05.57]Let's say Wednesday.
[425:07.17]And I might surprise you with an Omega Early stream on Tuesday.
[425:13.23]So let's just... I'm gonna say Wednesday at 2 p.m.
[425:16.92]Pacific.
[425:22.81]But it could happen on Tuesday.
[425:24.71]But don't put that in the sauce because I don't want people to think that I'm going to be there.
[425:27.15]So there it is.
[425:32.70]Breath of the Wilds.
[425:33.80]Thumbs up.
[425:34.78]It's fun.
[425:36.70]I very much enjoyed my time there.
[425:38.04]There were a lot of raids tonight.
[425:41.32]Thanks, Point Crow.
[425:42.35]First of all, automated.
[425:43.39]Gravefruit.
[425:45.69]It's like three raids.
[425:47.25]Pretty chunky raids.
[425:50.70]And with that, we'll call it here.
[425:52.58]Sorry for the internet bullshit.
[425:54.76]I don't get it.
[425:55.28]It makes no sense.
[425:55.86]You see what happened?
[425:57.84]From like 7.30 to like 8.15 Pacific, it was all over the place.
[426:06.62]But it's been perfect for the last two or three hours.
[426:09.00]I don't get it.
[426:16.99]Oh, save it.
[426:17.55]Yeah, okay.
[426:21.44]Saving the game.
[426:24.96]So we... You know what?
[426:26.75]I might open with something else for like an hour or two and then move to Breath of the Wild for like the remainder of the next like three, four, five hours of the stream on Wednesday.
[426:39.40]We'll see.
[426:40.88]I'm into it though.
[426:44.40]I'm very into it.
[426:53.24]Uh, I don't know if you heard it, but I literally walked off and died.
[426:55.42]Alright, I'll see you guys on Wednesday, maybe Tuesday, but Wednesday is what we're gonna say.
[427:10.69]When is Sorcery gonna be back?
[427:13.33]Yeah... there's a lot to do.
[427:22.23]Post the pee strip pic to Twitter.
[427:28.85]No, no, no.
[427:31.26]Maybe on your birthday.
[427:37.22]Thanks for watching.
[427:38.92]See you soon, everybody.
[427:44.54]I can't believe I streamed for 14 hours on Friday into Saturday.
[427:56.44]That was weird.
[427:58.38]That was- I had a lot of fun, though.
[427:59.10]Alright, goodnight, guys!
[428:04.00]Call your mother.
[428:05.41]Take care of yourselves.
[428:06.91]Have a great remainder of what's left of this weekend here, which for most of you is over.
[428:12.69]But have a good Monday.
[428:13.47]Have a good Tuesday.
[428:14.35]See you Wednesday.
[428:16.03]See you later, guys.
