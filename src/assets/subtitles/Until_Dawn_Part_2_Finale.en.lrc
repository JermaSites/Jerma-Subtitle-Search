[00:52.03]Hi, everybody.
[00:54.63]Welcome to Tuesday's stream.
[00:56.57]What the hell was that?
[01:01.37]It sounded like I was fucking 90 years old.
[01:05.04]Hey, everybody.
[01:05.68]Welcome to Tuesday's stream.
[01:08.12]God.
[01:08.66]Welcome.
[01:10.04]Probably should have cleared my throat before I hit the on button.
[01:15.86]I didn't, though.
[01:16.32]Whatever.
[01:17.89]We're gonna finish the video game called Until Dawn.
[01:24.47]I'm so late.
[01:25.54]I said I was going to be like 15 minutes late.
[01:29.64]I have an issue today.
[01:31.44]And it's going to affect the stream's quality.
[01:33.91]It just will.
[01:35.87]Unfortunately.
[01:39.13]I get migraines.
[01:40.40]Bad.
[01:40.70]A lot of you guys already know that already.
[01:43.91]And I spent all day in bed today.
[01:46.55]I was like asleep for like 14 hours.
[01:49.61]Because I just couldn't get out of bed.
[01:50.61]Because I have this awful migraine.
[01:52.43]It's better now.
[01:53.77]But if you don't know about migraines.
[01:56.58]When you have one.
[01:58.22]A bad one.
[01:59.44]Windows update.
[02:00.30]Get the fuck.
[02:01.38]Don't even do it.
[02:03.38]What's going on here?
[02:04.52]No.
[02:04.92]Turn this shit off.
[02:07.00]Do not turn my computer off right now.
[02:12.80]Like, Windows 10, please.
[02:19.10]So I'm a little under the weather.
[02:20.89]It might affect stream quality.
[02:22.61]You might not get as many fucking hilarious fucking wacky jokes.
[02:25.77]No, of course you will.
[02:27.05]I'm serious.
[02:29.75]No, we're gonna finish Till Dawn.
[02:30.67]I just want to make sure you guys know that, like, if I, like, slur my words together for some reason, it's because I had a migraine today.
[02:36.83]That happens.
[02:38.41]And you know what?
[02:39.81]Any time that I say something stupid, or any time I have trouble with something, it's because I had a migraine at some point in my life.
[02:48.06]Thank you, uh, Ilvry.
[02:50.37]Am I saying your name right?
[02:51.57]Is it Ivry, Ilvry, Levroy?
[02:55.03]Like, what is it?
[02:57.55]I want to get it correct.
[03:00.00]I just turned off auto-updates.
[03:01.00]Yeah, they're off.
[03:02.08]But thank you for the $8.49, 8.50.
[03:03.56]Hey, Jerma, heard you're getting over a migraine.
[03:06.02]Got a jet soon.
[03:07.63]But this should cover the cost of Advil in accordance to Boston sales tax.
[03:11.81]Take care.
[03:12.23]Hope you feel better.
[03:17.79]Well, thank you.
[03:18.51]Thank you for the bottle of Advil.
[03:24.53]Alright, so let me move this over here.
[03:26.61]You know we're here.
[03:29.12]Let's get that going.
[03:29.94]There's our, there's Dr. Acula.
[03:39.65]You notice when you went back to watch past streams, a lot of great content happens when I'm sick.
[03:44.79]Really?
[03:45.89]Well, alright, cool.
[03:47.43]Expect some fucking good content then.
[03:52.89]Your migrants feel like Edward Scissorhands stuck in his hand.
[03:57.07]Edward Scissorhands, like, stabbing your brain.
[03:58.97]Yeah, the worst thing about migraines.
[04:01.61]It's not for me.
[04:02.31]I can, like, handle, like, the pain.
[04:04.89]It's not the pain that bothers me.
[04:06.93]It's, like, the full two-day hangover that I get.
[04:11.76]Where I feel like I drank, like, fucking four bottles of vodka.
[04:16.10]It sucks.
[04:16.98]I feel like I'm just slow.
[04:18.30]I'm cognitively not, like, completely there.
[04:20.66]It's awful.
[04:21.20]I feel like I'm just drunk.
[04:22.92]It's awful.
[04:24.43]I can deal with the pain, but not that shit.
[04:26.27]It's annoying.
[04:27.59]Alright, enough of the pity party.
[04:31.06]Let's finish Until Dawn.
[04:35.58]Did I kill anyone yet?
[04:36.94]I don't know.
[04:38.96]I think there's only one person that's dead.
[04:41.42]Barely.
[04:44.14]Let's go.
[04:45.42]And that was loud.
[04:46.35]At least we're going to get a previously on Until Dawn.
[04:49.17]Let's see what happened last time.
[04:53.81]Josh!
[04:55.93]Josh!
[04:56.45]How does it feel?
[04:57.31]Do you enjoy all those emotions that my sisters got to feel once, one year ago?
[05:02.93]Only guess what?
[05:03.59]They didn't get to laugh it off!
[05:04.89]No!
[05:05.60]Nope!
[05:06.06]No, no, no!
[05:07.08]They're gone!
[05:08.78]Jessica's fucking dead!
[05:11.14]What?
[05:12.40]Did you hear me?
[05:14.28]Jessica is dead.
[05:15.24]And you are gonna fucking pay, you dick!
[05:18.50]What happened?
[05:20.42]I don't think Jess is dead.
[05:23.48]Jess, she's not dead.
[05:24.28]Christ.
[05:31.28]Look at all these spoilers.
[05:32.26]Well, I mean, I've played the game for like six hours already.
[05:34.90]Looks like we're just going right back into it.
[05:50.71]Okay.
[05:51.51]So I have a flare.
[05:52.61]I'm currently playing as Emily.
[05:53.87]And I've got my red ice cream cone.
[05:58.35]Say, you thought the jokes weren't going to fucking start flowing.
[06:02.06]Dermot has a migraine.
[06:03.02]Oh, he doesn't feel good.
[06:04.08]Red ice cream cone with fucking sparklers on it.
[06:06.48]Come on!
[06:07.84]Give me that one.
[06:08.46]That one was good.
[06:14.12]What's this?
[06:20.37]Alright, somebody gets angry?
[06:25.49]Fortune totem, what is that?
[06:29.07]Another joke.
[06:29.73]Alright, so prophecy of good fortune.
[06:34.83]Why is that good fortune?
[06:35.75]That looks like he just scratched off a lottery ticket.
[06:38.17]There you go.
[06:39.51]Here's your fucking first joke of the evening.
[06:42.08]That's the good fortune?
[06:43.40]Don't think so.
[06:44.50]You know when you get a lottery ticket and you scratch it off and your winning numbers are like 12 and 16?
[06:50.05]And you scratch off 13, the next one you scratch off is fucking like 14?
[06:54.13]And the one after that's 11?
[06:55.47]You're like, God, I would've won a million dollars.
[06:57.33]Joke.
[07:03.63]But I don't need to say joke after that.
[07:14.73]Alright.
[07:15.47]No more jokes.
[07:19.25]Let's play a laugh track.
[07:20.58]You know, one of these days I'm gonna do that.
[07:21.80]You know that, right?
[07:26.38]There's a bug in here now.
[07:28.68]And it's gonna really bother me.
[07:33.03]I fucking hate when there's a bug in the room.
[07:34.51]And it's a fast flying bug.
[07:36.91]Mosquitoes are easy.
[07:37.99]You clap your hands and they explode.
[07:39.69]That's easy.
[07:41.00]A moth is easy.
[07:41.88]You just, like, crush them into the wall.
[07:44.42]A fly?
[07:44.96]Not easy.
[07:45.80]God damn it.
[07:46.18]What are these fucking monsters?
[08:01.91]We haven't seen a monster.
[08:02.81]Oh boy!
[08:03.97]Almost just dropped the ice cream.
[08:06.35]Alright, yeah.
[08:08.69]That thing, we've seen that.
[08:10.27]No, we haven't.
[08:10.81]Alright, we're gonna go left.
[08:18.53]That's like Slenderman Gollum.
[08:22.45]What?
[08:23.35]Okay, that's like somebody made Gollum in a creator character.
[08:28.02]Watch out for fucking WWE creator character Gollum.
[08:31.99]He's coming.
[08:34.20]Right now.
[08:44.58]Right now.
[08:45.44]Oh, God.
[08:49.90]Oh, God.
[08:51.46]Alright.
[08:51.86]I think we're good.
[08:58.72]Okay.
[08:58.94]Okay.
[08:59.24]It's not bad with them.
[09:00.18]Oh, shit.
[09:00.44]Don't move.
[09:00.72]I got this.
[09:05.98]How long do I have to not move for?
[09:07.68]Oh, I almost moved.
[09:09.92]Oh shit, my flare's out.
[09:17.57]Nice.
[09:20.95]Oh, that's the clown!
[09:22.51]That's the thing that's had the clown vision the whole time.
[09:27.46]Okay.
[09:29.18]Well, what is it then?
[09:31.84]It's gonna be one of the miners.
[09:38.22]Convenient stones.
[09:42.22]Really, you fall there.
[09:43.04]That's where you fall.
[09:47.86]Stay on it, stay on it.
[09:48.84]Don't fucking jump off.
[09:52.69]Don't fall, it's like a meat grinder.
[09:54.17]I knew it was gonna be a meat grinder.
[09:55.35]Oh shit, I didn't press circle.
[09:58.93]Okay, hold on a minute.
[10:00.25]I knew it was gonna be a meat grinder.
[10:02.71]I was certain it was gonna be a meat grinder.
[10:13.60]What?
[10:13.88]What?
[10:16.08]I was waiting for the prompt, and it didn't give one to me.
[10:19.62]I just got bit.
[10:22.56]You know what happens when you get bit.
[10:25.99]I don't know how I'm gonna do fun to the fucking Gollum monster later.
[10:31.97]That's what this is.
[10:32.93]Like, some virus broke out in the mines, and...
[10:42.37]Alright, remember in the very beginning when that happened to the first two characters and they were dead?
[10:47.66]Uh, why did she survive this?
[10:51.87]I don't know, she just like threw too many pitches.
[10:53.91]Okay, we're good.
[11:11.39]She should have just dropped her in the meat grinder.
[11:21.87]But no, we're trying to get everybody to stay alive.
[11:23.86]This is a bad idea.
[11:24.32]Didn't she get bit?
[11:42.94]She's gonna turn and she's gonna fucking bite somebody.
[11:45.48]Time to be Chris.
[11:46.06]Let's be confused here.
[12:01.52]Oh, wait a minute.
[12:02.88]They're not human.
[12:03.54]Well, why is it this guy?
[12:05.08]This guy has to be the one that... Hmm.
[12:06.78]What happened?
[12:07.26]Where is he?
[12:22.75]M, can you tell us exactly what happened?
[12:24.71]I am trying to tell you.
[12:26.21]We were climbing up the tower and it fell.
[12:28.91]The whole tower just fell right into the mine.
[12:31.37]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[12:32.09]What mine?
[12:33.31]There are these mine shafts all over running under everything.
[12:36.13]When the tower fell, we ended up down there.
[12:38.03]I don't understand.
[12:38.81]The tower fell?
[12:39.45]How'd it fall?
[12:41.48]Matt, like, dropped it.
[12:42.58]It was dark and I found this pile and there was Beth's head.
[12:46.94]Wait, what?
[12:48.08]Beth's head.
[12:48.80]I found it.
[12:49.40]Oh, my God.
[12:50.16]What the fuck?
[12:50.66]Are you serious?
[12:52.79]I wish she came back to me and I should act like concerned.
[12:55.81]I didn't get to choose that.
[12:57.49]I wanted to choose that.
[12:58.29]He's coming in quick.
[13:24.33]M, and by the way, N comes after that, and then L, and then O, and then P. Got the alphabet, that's what he says.
[13:32.85]That was a two cent joke, yeah.
[13:35.81]It was.
[13:55.69]Isn't there a gun somewhere in this house that I can use?
[13:59.05]Yeah, if you're just joining us for the first time, this is, wait a minute, this is important.
[14:05.96]This is the flamethrower guy.
[14:10.60]Alright, just cover the door.
[14:12.30]Don't, like, drop the gun down.
[14:19.81]I can't- you can see through the fucking blinds.
[14:23.29]There's a guy standing there.
[14:25.71]He doesn't see that guy?
[14:26.73]Alright, they're probably gone already.
[14:28.59]He doesn't like to fucking see them through the door.
[14:40.64]Look at this fucking immersion.
[14:42.32]God.
[14:43.38]Who the fuck is this guy?
[14:47.83]Hold on there, mister.
[14:50.95]Freeze.
[14:51.45]Ah, what?
[14:52.33]Alright.
[14:52.73]Are you serious?
[14:53.79]Just take it easy, Grandpa.
[14:56.63]Okay, everybody, just calm down.
[14:58.43]Now, just move over there.
[15:00.88]Go on, move.
[15:01.84]Let me say what I came to say.
[15:04.30]What?
[15:05.16]I'm here to tell you what you're up against being back on this mountain.
[15:10.14]You should never have returned.
[15:12.52]I don't know why you did after what happened last year.
[15:15.02]You mean with Hannah and Beth?
[15:16.26]Yeah, how could you know without being involved?
[15:18.14]Or responsible?
[15:18.92]You hold on to your horses.
[15:20.90]I don't take kindly to you kids coming up here to my mountain.
[15:24.30]Your mountain?
[15:26.00]I'm sure the Washingtons would be very surprised to hear that.
[15:29.91]Well...
[15:31.16]The mountain don't belong to me, it's true.
[15:33.58]But it don't belong to the Washingtons.
[15:36.48]This mountain belongs to the Windigo.
[15:39.72]Uh-oh.
[15:40.92]Who?
[15:41.20]What's he talking about?
[15:42.89]He's talking about, like, the Native American.
[15:44.85]Now that we have a choice.
[15:47.95]Now, I'm only going to tell you this once.
[15:50.89]It doesn't matter to me if you believe it or not.
[15:54.45]I got reasons I wanna get it off my chest.
[15:57.05]He's gonna die.
[15:57.59]The fucking mutant's gonna come in and rip his head off when he's about to say, like, the fucking title.
[16:00.91]He's guilty of shit.
[16:01.47]Guilty of something.
[16:02.67]Shut up, Mike.
[16:04.81]Sacred Earth Mountain.
[16:05.91]There is a curse that dwells in these mountains.
[16:10.42]Should any man or woman resort to cannibalism in these woods, the spirit of the Wendigo shall be unleashed.
[16:17.08]Hannah ate Beth.
[16:17.84]Got it.
[16:18.08]Oh, crap.
[16:20.88]Wait, is he remembering that he ate somebody?
[16:24.72]Oh.
[16:26.70]I thought he was like, oh shit, I shouldn't have eaten that person.
[16:29.90]God damn it, what did I do?
[16:32.10]You're gonna need to find somewhere safe.
[16:34.32]The basement might be okay.
[16:36.55]Okay, get down there now, all of you, and wait.
[16:39.53]What?
[16:40.05]Why?
[16:40.71]For how long?
[16:41.79]Until Dawn.
[16:43.25]There it is.
[16:44.77]Guys.
[16:45.49]I knew it.
[16:46.11]I ran off and left Josh when I heard screaming.
[16:49.38]Where did you leave him?
[16:51.24]In the shed.
[16:51.68]Huh.
[16:53.55]Your friend will already be dead.
[16:56.15]No.
[16:57.39]No, he can't be.
[16:58.83]We were just with him.
[17:00.19]A lot can happen quickly on this mountain.
[17:03.92]No, I'm not letting anything else happen.
[17:06.36]Anything else?
[17:08.16]What do you mean?
[17:09.62]Roll the title card, you mean.
[17:12.94]I hit him.
[17:14.50]We thought he'd kill Jessica, and so he got me riled up.
[17:18.39]I hit him in the head.
[17:19.91]Maybe he deserved it.
[17:21.43]No matter what, we can't just let him die.
[17:24.20]Then I'll go with you.
[17:26.20]I don't need your help.
[17:27.66]Going alone is suicide.
[17:30.97]I like this guy's voice.
[17:32.09]The rest of you, get down to the basement.
[17:34.93]Be safe.
[17:36.11]Don't go outside again until we're back.
[17:39.00]So we've seen this guy periodically throughout the whole game.
[17:40.90]You don't seem to understand the magnitude of the situation.
[17:43.90]He's been flamethrowing random places.
[17:45.22]Well, I'm going to get Josh, aren't I?
[17:46.78]No, I'm going to get Josh.
[17:48.65]You're going to help me.
[17:50.05]Do you understand?
[17:51.07]Uh-oh.
[17:52.41]Choices.
[17:52.89]Here he comes.
[17:54.17]Yeah, I think so.
[17:55.85]You need to follow me and do everything I tell you.
[18:02.52]Grab pen and smash pen into back of his gas tank.
[18:05.74]Why is that not a choice?
[18:10.14]Grab knife on table, stab as hard as you can into propane tank.
[18:14.36]Why is that not... Oh, a shotty!
[18:16.54]Wait, did he...
[18:31.12]I'm not gonna kill this guy.
[18:43.83]This guy is the only- You don't ever kill the guy that knows everything on the mountain.
[18:46.95]He's gonna die on his own in a cutscene.
[18:48.33]Don't worry.
[18:48.71]Don't you guys worry.
[18:57.23]Don't you guys have any idea?
[18:58.85]The fucking random, like, mystical dude that knows everything will die in a cutscene before he says the secret.
[19:05.40]You mean this thing won't even kill it?
[19:12.53]Why can't I get a Ghostbusters proton pack?
[19:18.36]That's not fair.
[19:20.80]This guy just kind of looks like a Ghostbuster.
[19:29.46]He's in, like, the Ghostbusters costume.
[19:34.33]This guy's just crazy.
[19:35.35]He just, like, fucking stumbled into the woods after cosplaying in, like, packs.
[19:38.97]I mean, can you figure out what they're gonna do?
[19:40.59]He lost his fucking mind in the woods.
[19:42.93]They adhere to some pattern.
[19:45.22]Like any animal.
[19:47.34]Or human.
[19:49.08]What do you mean, like how?
[19:50.44]Like they've got schedules?
[19:58.15]Can't we just say, like, fuck this guy?
[20:00.29]Why are we going back to rescue the guy that caused so many problems throughout the whole game here?
[20:05.23]I feel like this is Burgah Boy just talking in his normal voice.
[20:16.52]Hey, what is this?
[20:17.18]I need to look at this.
[20:18.60]Hey, thank you premium pillow for the five bucks.
[20:37.21]Premium Pill says, I love when I have to log in to give bits, and then when I send the message it doesn't give the bits.
[20:42.46]I have waited for this stream all weekend.
[20:44.70]Well, welcome.
[20:46.10]Thank you.
[20:46.36]Welcome back.
[20:49.16]Also, thank you to Calgary.
[20:50.58]If these things, when the girls are or were human, do they still have some aspect of humanity?
[21:00.15]I'm trying to like...
[21:03.90]Thank you Jules, 808, and Chris as well.
[21:06.40]I am liking the game.
[21:07.58]Thank you Calgaroon as well.
[21:08.84]Alright, shut up, Chris.
[21:11.14]No, not you.
[21:11.64]Not like you that gave the bits over there.
[21:14.06]I'm talking about this Chris.
[21:14.87]If your name is Chris, I'm sorry.
[21:16.07]That's not what I meant.
[21:16.83]Alright, let's see.
[21:18.19]Why did we even come back here?
[21:30.23]Oh, he's gone.
[21:30.83]We're too late.
[21:32.31]Shh, quiet.
[21:35.69]Why even come back for this guy?
[21:37.05]Right now.
[21:39.00]We gotta find Josh.
[21:39.92]He could still be out there.
[21:41.96]First, the windigo.
[21:45.28]He'll render you immobile.
[21:47.20]Okay.
[21:48.04]And then he strips the skin off of your entire body, piece by piece.
[21:56.46]He keeps you alive and aware and feasts on your organs one piece at a time.
[22:02.67]That's fucked up.
[22:04.35]So the Lord's done.
[22:06.05]Yeah.
[22:07.15]Let's go now.
[22:08.73]Imagine if I got the choice to stay.
[22:11.99]Stay and investigate the Wendigo.
[22:20.24]Oh, okay.
[22:21.60]Let's go.
[22:23.73]Wait a minute.
[22:25.61]There's probably something in here, guys.
[22:27.95]Like, there is, there is, there is.
[22:29.17]I know I'm supposed to leave.
[22:30.23]Ah, forget it.
[22:38.80]Like, there's gonna be a fucking, like, secret here.
[22:41.30]I have to look.
[22:42.30]Okay, well, at least I have the shotgun.
[22:45.89]I'll be okay.
[22:49.24]Alright, whatever.
[22:54.85]Apparently there's nothing here.
[22:55.73]Except there's something right here.
[23:04.11]He just said, oh crap, a few times.
[23:06.28]I gotta go.
[23:06.72]I'm being patiently waited for.
[23:10.76]By the fucking flambé.
[23:16.40]Oh, what?
[23:16.82]What?
[23:18.14]What the- what?!
[23:18.68]Oh, come on!
[23:21.32]Run!
[23:21.86]I was- there was no preparing for that.
[23:23.76]You can't scream, don't- It just burned me!
[23:27.60]Goddamn!
[23:27.82]I'm right out low.
[23:32.15]Gotta get out of here!
[23:35.51]Oh, he just got him!
[23:36.83]I told you guys!
[23:37.63]Oh shit!
[23:41.13]Oh my god!
[23:42.28]Oh my god, he got him!
[23:43.78]Oh my god, cause I stepped on a fucking twig!
[23:48.31]Wait, what?
[23:49.61]What's going on?
[23:50.11]Shoot it.
[23:51.13]I couldn't shoot the gun.
[23:52.95]Oh my God.
[23:58.83]What?
[23:59.35]Why wouldn't the gun shoot?
[24:01.03]Why wouldn't the gun shoot?
[24:02.89]Why didn't the gun shoot?
[24:11.75]That gun wouldn't fire.
[24:15.53]The gun wouldn't fire.
[24:17.15]R2 didn't do anything.
[24:19.25]The gun wouldn't shoot.
[24:20.29]There was a bolt in that gun.
[24:21.46]I swear to God.
[24:22.58]The gun wouldn't fire.
[24:24.68]I'm literally sitting there pressing R2 over and over again.
[24:28.40]And it wouldn't shoot the gun.
[24:29.32]Okay.
[24:29.46]I tried to shoot the fuel tank.
[24:45.17]Hold on a minute.
[24:46.01]Look at this.
[24:47.77]You saw me, I tried to shoot the fuel tank, it didn't work, so I was like, okay, so I went over to the fucking Gollum zombie and I tried to shoot him and it didn't do anything.
[24:55.73]Hold on.
[24:57.19]What?
[25:00.81]That gun didn't have any bullets.
[25:02.19]What do you mean it didn't aim?
[25:08.41]What are you talking about?
[25:09.07]I was aiming at the fucking, the... What?
[25:21.16]Motion control?
[25:22.00]No, I don't have motion controls on.
[25:23.52]Mike, Ash, oh, thank God.
[25:26.00]Ash, what's wrong?
[25:27.20]It's... No, no, rewind.
[25:29.48]I can't rewind that.
[25:30.96]What do you mean?
[25:32.18]Mike, where is Chris?
[25:34.71]Oh, no.
[25:35.35]Oh, God, Ash.
[25:37.69]It's not X to shoot.
[25:38.95]It was R2 the whole time.
[25:40.37]He was out there.
[25:43.19]I'm so sorry, Ashley.
[25:45.63]He legit did not know how to use the shotgun.
[25:49.85]He's got to be dead, too.
[25:54.05]No, no rewinds.
[25:56.13]Something went wrong there.
[25:57.33]The gun didn't work.
[25:58.13]I didn't know how to use the gun.
[25:59.11]Mike, look, I really don't think that's a good idea.
[26:03.09]We should stay put right here Until Dawn.
[26:06.23]At least we're safe down here.
[26:07.68]Oh, yeah?
[26:08.90]All wrapped up like a little present with a bow on top?
[26:11.04]That thing to tear us apart on Christmas morning?
[26:12.76]People will come for us in the morning.
[26:15.48]You don't sound so sure.
[26:17.08]That is what'll happen, right, Em?
[26:20.00]Yeah, I mean, right?
[26:22.72]Well, you can wait.
[26:23.86]I'm leaving.
[26:24.28]And every single other time, I've had to use a gun.
[26:29.27]I aimed the thing so it turns blue over the spot, and then I press R2.
[26:33.45]That's how it's been the entire game.
[26:35.03]If that fucking thing got a hold of Josh, then we're shit out of luck.
[26:41.34]I don't know, Mike.
[26:42.04]It's possible.
[26:43.00]What's possible?
[26:44.46]It may have taken him down to the mine.
[26:46.89]What?
[26:48.73]I saw some horrible stuff down there.
[26:50.51]I think it's where that thing lives, and... Go run that fog back and look.
[26:54.91]Huh.
[26:57.31]Em?
[26:58.11]What?
[26:58.85]Fuck it.
[27:00.31]I'm gonna get that key right from that thing's goddamn bedroom, and then I'm gonna get us all the hell out of here.
[27:04.32]It never turned blue?
[27:07.48]What are you talking about it never turned blue?
[27:08.68]So that old guy's back?
[27:09.64]You just, like, stick it in there and press the button.
[27:11.90]That guy was prepared for anything.
[27:14.40]Not quite.
[27:16.15]What is this place?
[27:17.13]Home.
[27:19.54]Wait, what is that?
[27:21.52]I was down there.
[27:23.05]It was horrible.
[27:24.29]You were?
[27:25.61]There'd been a cave-in in the 50s, I guess, and these miners got trapped down there.
[27:31.21]Pause the game and run the VOD.
[27:32.21]There was this reporter, and I think he figured out there'd been some, like, big cover-up going on.
[27:37.52]I found these plans.
[27:38.72]They knew the mine was a death trap, but they let the miners keep working anyway.
[27:41.82]Michael, I'd like to maybe focus on how we're going to get the fuck out of here, please.
[27:46.05]I'm just saying, it's weird how much crazy shit's gone on up here.
[27:50.35]There's a lot of crazy shit going on.
[27:51.31]What's weird is that there's a tunnel leading from the lodge to the sanatorium, see?
[27:55.37]We'll look at it in a minute.
[27:56.27]That's how I got back here.
[27:58.69]I saw this when I was down there.
[28:00.33]That's where it lives.
[28:02.71]We start the whole game.
[28:04.05]Em?
[28:06.03]Em, what is... Huh?
[28:08.16]What is that?
[28:11.33]Oh, then noticing her wound.
[28:12.43]Oh, my God.
[28:12.81]Oh, my God.
[28:13.63]Oh, my God.
[28:14.35]It's nothing.
[28:15.13]It just bit me.
[28:16.55]It bit you?
[28:17.25]What bit you?
[28:19.67]The Wendigo.
[28:20.35]The what?
[28:21.40]It's nothing.
[28:22.30]Really, it's not.
[28:23.40]Quick, drown her.
[28:25.14]Shit.
[28:25.52]It doesn't hurt anymore.
[28:26.90]Really, it's not that bad.
[28:30.28]Em, if that thing.
[28:31.98]I know what you're thinking, and I'm fine.
[28:34.68]Are you?
[28:35.12]Yes.
[28:35.74]Emily, at least let us check it out.
[28:38.38]She's gonna pull it off.
[28:39.00]It's gonna be a bunch of bugs and shit.
[28:41.18]You could turn into one of those things.
[28:42.99]Oh, that's ridiculous.
[28:44.19]He said it was from eating each other.
[28:45.81]Remember, he said that.
[28:47.29]Is that how it worked?
[28:48.17]Yes, it happens.
[28:49.33]If it bit you, you're gonna turn into one, and then you're gonna turn on us.
[28:53.37]Oh, my God.
[28:53.99]Oh, my God.
[28:54.96]Oh, my God.
[28:56.90]Put some fucking A&D on there.
[28:58.48]You'll be alright.
[28:59.04]What?
[28:59.18]Mike?
[28:59.78]You gotta go.
[29:01.26]Are you kidding me?
[29:02.26]You're putting us all in danger.
[29:04.56]Like hell I am.
[29:05.62]Emily, you can't stay here.
[29:08.25]Mike, just cool your head, okay?
[29:09.95]We don't know if it works like that.
[29:11.37]Maybe it's just a bite.
[29:12.41]It probably doesn't work like that.
[29:14.09]Guys, what are you doing?
[29:17.29]Door's right here.
[29:17.87]Are we supposed to lock her in the closet or something?
[29:19.89]I'm letting you do this voluntarily.
[29:22.37]Oh, no, you're just making yourself feel better about sending me to my death since you know there's a Wendigo out there ready to rip me to pieces like it did with... Okay, oh, my God, will you just go?
[29:32.46]Go, get out of here!
[29:35.58]Uh, here we go.
[29:36.16]Whoa, okay.
[29:36.68]Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mike, calm down.
[29:38.56]I thought I told you to leave.
[29:39.58]You're gonna shoot me?
[29:42.56]Mike, me?
[29:43.84]This is the safe room, Em.
[29:46.71]Please.
[29:47.19]It is not safe as long as you're in it.
[29:49.63]Not for us.
[29:52.86]Don't do this!
[29:53.66]I'm not gonna shoot him.
[29:54.54]I'm really sorry.
[29:55.20]I have to make this choice.
[29:57.54]Oh, I wonder, is it R2?
[29:58.78]Take a look.
[30:00.21]If I have it over there, watch this.
[30:01.51]See?
[30:01.99]That's what it did last time and it didn't shoot.
[30:03.49]I can't do this.
[30:08.25]That's exactly what happened last time.
[30:10.11]Go look.
[30:11.63]Maybe.
[30:13.35]For now.
[30:17.42]You can't kill somebody that quickly.
[30:18.90]Are you serious?
[30:21.46]Should've tested it.
[30:30.81]I was gonna.
[30:32.59]I fucking was smashing R2.
[30:34.82]Go watch the fucking VOD.
[30:36.36]If you're watching the VOD right now, if you're a VOD watcher, you know what I'm talking about.
[30:39.10]You can just skip.
[30:39.92]You can go back and be like, oh, wow, he's right.
[30:41.34]He did do that and hit R2 a bunch of times.
[30:43.54]Fucking shitty PS4 controller mechanism.
[30:57.04]If she shows a sign of turning, that's when you shoot them.
[30:58.56]They're gonna go through an animation where they're like, and when she starts to do that, bang, right in the face.
[31:17.66]Okay, Wendigo must be contained.
[31:20.06]Grows out of cannibalism.
[31:23.93]You don't give me an entire fucking diary to read, and then go back to a cutscene.
[31:31.07]MonkaMan found dead.
[31:32.07]The creature is real and dangerous.
[31:36.23]If you are reading this, you will have questions, but I do not have all the answers.
[31:39.15]The evidence and story is my own experience.
[31:43.69]Let's get like... Alright, mining.
[31:45.94]The miners were eating each other.
[31:49.78]Don't step on the stick next time.
[31:51.82]Stillness.
[31:53.30]Totally.
[31:54.76]Not mimic.
[31:56.16]Wait, we gotta... I know how this works.
[31:59.16]Alright, we gotta read all the fucking highlighted letters.
[32:02.58]That's the code.
[32:03.24]That's the code he was trying to give us.
[32:04.74]Fuck.
[32:05.34]Can't.
[32:08.14]Higher craving... Okay.
[32:09.02]Okay.
[32:11.22]Found native artifacts.
[32:14.96]Hungry cravings.
[32:16.78]Skill and ribcage found miles apart.
[32:18.60]Who survived the collapse?
[32:21.54]Stripped of all their bones.
[32:22.98]And their skin.
[32:26.24]Eat the flesh of another.
[32:27.16]Wait.
[32:29.68]Bite of another wendigo.
[32:30.88]But the bite is harmless.
[32:32.74]I have been bitten, but I did not change.
[32:34.60]The only way is to eat the... What did he cross out?
[32:40.42]Okay, so you have to eat somebody.
[32:45.98]Emily has to eat someone or she'll turn into a... They're drained of all their bones.
[33:01.10]It says that...
[33:05.05]Yeah, I kind of have to eat me.
[33:07.37]Why would you hide that?
[33:08.23]She picks up the gun and then you can like aim and shoot her.
[33:35.01]Oh my god.
[33:35.81]It says you have to eat somebody.
[33:36.83]That's what it said.
[33:37.87]Alright, that slap was... And why would you not take the gun?
[34:03.95]What the fuck are you people doing?
[34:07.51]You leave like the fucking Necronomicon.
[34:09.67]And the gun.
[34:10.07]Joshua, you should have listened to me.
[34:13.67]Because of your choices, people have died.
[34:16.17]Because of your shitty mechanics.
[34:17.21]I don't know which is worse, actively triggering events that lead to someone's death, or passively allowing a tragedy to occur.
[34:27.84]Because you couldn't lift a goddamn finger to help someone else.
[34:36.87]Hold on.
[34:38.52]Hold on.
[34:40.46]Wait, wait, wait.
[34:43.56]Hold on.
[34:43.91]Stop, stop, stop.
[34:45.61]Pause.
[34:46.59]Pause it.
[34:48.01]Jerma shoots the gun.
[34:51.30]I'm watching it.
[34:53.70]I see it like I murdered that guy.
[34:56.28]I'm watching it right now.
[34:57.12]You're going to see it.
[34:58.14]You're going to hear me pressing R2.
[35:04.85]And where's my shooting?
[35:06.35]Oh, it didn't work.
[35:06.97]It didn't work.
[35:07.49]It didn't work.
[35:08.13]It didn't work again.
[35:11.00]Fucking unbelievable.
[35:11.74]You saw it.
[35:18.14]There it is.
[35:20.34]That's just their black and white.
[35:21.76]Black and white.
[35:25.01]What the fuck is this?
[35:26.09]Your game has gone terribly wrong.
[35:27.43]And your friends, like your sisters, have deserted you.
[35:49.24]Took me 15 seconds to figure... I tried to shoot the tank on the fucking left side, and it didn't work.
[35:54.87]Um... That didn't hurt anybody.
[36:21.17]It's just a game, man.
[36:48.24]That's not one of my fears.
[36:50.12]I didn't pick that.
[36:53.90]I didn't pick that as one of my fears in the beginning of the game.
[36:56.98]Ash, what's wrong?
[36:59.82]It's... It's not good up there.
[37:04.76]Ash!
[37:06.52]Ash!
[37:08.58]I could have had everybody saved.
[37:09.88]That's just bullshit.
[37:11.48]What about the old guy?
[37:13.02]No sign of him.
[37:23.83]What are you looking for?
[37:25.11]Another way out.
[37:26.45]Mike, there's no key for the cable car.
[37:29.27]Josh, he's gotta have it.
[37:31.29]You actually did pick that lonely on the farm?
[37:33.75]Oh, I did, didn't I?
[37:38.19]Oh wait, that was the good fortune.
[37:41.03]That was the good fortune.
[37:42.99]Alright.
[37:43.77]Episode 9, Karma.
[37:44.31]Two more chapters until the game ends.
[38:02.96]After this one.
[38:12.43]I'm safe in the safe room.
[38:18.59]Alright, so very rapidly here, a lot of these characters are going to have a chance to die.
[38:23.41]So, like, place your bets on who's going to make it out.
[38:26.44]I don't know.
[38:28.06]Depends on if, like, I can shoot the gun this time.
[38:38.26]Over there.
[38:38.68]Nothing important over there.
[38:41.26]Nothing over there.
[38:45.60]Fucking laundry.
[38:46.36]You guys don't think anyone's going to make it out?
[38:48.54]You have that?
[38:50.42]You have that little confidence in my ability to play this game?
[38:53.33]Where we're at the end of the game and the only character that's died so far is because of a fucked up, like, shitty controller game mechanic?
[39:02.13]Very clearly, the evidence is there that I pressed R2 with the green, like, please shoot, rectical.
[39:09.41]And that don't matter.
[39:10.47]That's the only reason why those two characters died.
[39:15.39]Yep.
[39:15.61]Yep.
[39:15.75]You all think so.
[39:16.25]Alright.
[39:16.47]Fine.
[39:18.03]No one else is dying the rest of the time I play.
[39:21.69]Checking it.
[39:22.07]I did check the bot.
[39:22.99]I watched it.
[39:23.68]Somebody clipped it.
[39:28.70]You can hear me going like this.
[39:31.64]You can hear it.
[39:32.92]You can hear it.
[39:33.48]The evidence is there.
[39:35.48]I would get acquitted.
[39:37.14]There would be a fucking mistrial.
[39:38.90]I would go home and go back to fucking school, wherever the hell I was going.
[39:43.34]I would go back to work.
[39:45.54]Why would I go back to school?
[39:46.42]I'm fucking, like, in my thirties.
[39:51.18]Nope, it's not one of those things.
[40:00.41]Um... Why is this one not doing anything?
[40:05.29]What?
[40:07.61]How come this one doesn't give me, like, weird, like, tiki vision?
[40:13.91]What?
[40:14.19]What?
[40:14.49]What's going on here?
[40:23.32]It's my fault, right?
[40:25.84]Huh?
[40:26.20]It's my fault that this doesn't work?
[40:31.08]Really?
[40:31.74]You're gonna give me fucking my fault for this not working?
[40:40.73]I already have this one?
[40:47.24]Fuck, I do.
[40:53.66]Fuck, I really was hoping my R2 was broken so I could really get you guys.
[41:04.57]Well, where am I going?
[41:05.67]Apparently this way.
[41:10.43]R2 is innocent.
[41:14.55]No, none of us are innocent.
[41:15.87]Not even R2.
[41:16.39]God, don't you guys wish that there was a... Holy shit.
[41:23.86]A D2 on the PlayStation 4 controller?
[41:26.62]Huh.
[41:27.40]You know what I mean?
[41:28.70]So, like, you would see, like, button combinations, like, R2, D2.
[41:30.98]Star Wars.
[41:32.16]Star Wars.
[41:56.34]I can't open it.
[41:57.02]Actually, I can't open it.
[42:01.78]Really.
[42:04.34]Woody the Woodpecker.
[42:05.70]Hey, wait, is the dog still there?
[42:11.41]Woody... Woody Woodpecker.
[42:16.31]You replace... Okay, take the Star Wars fucking thing that I just did.
[42:19.83]That really just is Woody the Woodpecker's intro.
[42:23.12]They're the same exact melody.
[42:33.44]Then the Woody Woodpecker intro is... It's the fucking same thing.
[42:41.63]Are you serious?
[42:42.33]Nobody's found that out yet.
[42:44.09]That's it.
[42:44.77]We got that.
[42:45.23]We got that here.
[42:45.77]We made it in a fucking... The Jerma985 stream Twitch chat.
[42:49.71]It's the same exact fucking song.
[42:51.69]Got it.
[42:57.85]Somebody copied somebody.
[42:59.09]I don't know who it was.
[43:04.92]History has been made.
[43:10.84]Can't get this door?
[43:18.42]Where's the dog?
[43:21.20]The dog should still be sitting right here, right?
[43:24.92]You think I might have more than a migraine?
[43:28.11]Yeah, well.
[43:29.97]I'll give you a list of all my issues.
[43:31.43]OK, well, this has to be something I can do.
[43:40.55]Now you can't watch the VOD copyright strike.
[43:45.96]I'm not going to get a copyright strike with that.
[43:47.54]Come on, man.
[43:49.14]Come on.
[43:50.92]I've already looked at this.
[43:58.22]Uh, this shit in here.
[43:59.10]Can I get in this?
[44:04.14]What?
[44:06.84]Why would it zoom in like this?
[44:10.32]Weird.
[44:10.58]I guess I can't do anything with this.
[44:16.62]I can look at it.
[44:22.76]Well.
[44:23.72]Oh well.
[44:25.70]Why is nobody here?
[44:26.70]Well, it's on sub only.
[44:28.38]To prevent spoilers.
[44:31.87]Dog is not here anymore.
[44:35.73]Guys, I don't want to look over in chat and see, you know, somebody writing the end of the game.
[44:41.72]That's very possible.
[44:45.46]Very possible.
[44:54.87]Yeah, end of the game.
[44:56.79]You guys are clever.
[44:58.29]That's a good one.
[45:00.49]Oh, now I can drop down, okay.
[45:02.75]That would hurt a lot.
[45:09.96]That's a very big smile.
[45:11.16]Let's open this first.
[45:12.02]Because I'm not gonna get like a Wendigo to fucking jump at me and not have a place to run.
[45:19.32]Here is a... Okay, there's... What do you guys think I should take?
[45:24.12]Should I take the cordless vacuum cleaner or should I take the torch?
[45:28.44]I just need a pitchfork and a mob.
[45:34.79]Why don't you take the fucking portable vacuum cleaner?
[45:42.07]Does he not see the gun?
[45:45.21]I'm gonna take these, like, lipsticks.
[45:47.01]What are these for?
[45:48.11]Oh, a gun.
[45:51.97]Ah, good enough.
[45:59.40]Okay, well, at least now I got like a cordless vacuum.
[46:04.66]I'm gonna say it again.
[46:12.25]So these things are like werewolves, they're gonna hate fire.
[46:19.97]Anything else down here that I can do?
[46:21.17]That I can, like, burn?
[46:29.37]Yeah, I would put that box of ammo underneath my arm and hold it like a football.
[46:33.88]Sorry, my AC just turned on.
[46:39.50]Like, why wouldn't you fucking just football carry, like a running back, that whole box?
[46:43.66]Holy hell.
[46:46.61]Charlie Miller, Adam White, and Evelyn Daniels.
[46:49.89]They all died together.
[46:51.13]They all ate each other.
[46:56.67]Is that it?
[47:01.00]Well, I have a second here.
[47:01.84]StixRenegade, thanks for the five bucks.
[47:03.12]If no one else dies, I'll donate $100 next week.
[47:08.24]Oh, well.
[47:10.12]I'm going to try.
[47:11.44]Thank you, though.
[47:12.10]Also, thanks to GummyMonk for the five bucks as well.
[47:13.88]You fucked it up too badly.
[47:14.96]You've got to rewind.
[47:16.68]I can't really.
[47:18.70]Somebody else gave bits and I didn't see who it was.
[47:21.60]People subscribed too.
[47:22.68]I gotta think.
[47:25.14]I gotta get a solution for the whole sub thing.
[47:26.81]I don't know.
[47:27.27]I've talked about this a fucking hundred times before.
[47:29.47]I've gotta think of like a fucking solution.
[47:33.11]Because I want to be able to acknowledge people that subscribe.
[47:38.28]But I don't want it to like take over the stream.
[47:41.82]Because I see streams like that, and I'm not going to dog anybody or down any streamer, but you guys know what I'm talking about.
[47:49.49]Where fucking every eight seconds, the whole fucking thing freezes.
[47:56.23]To say seven names in a row, and then like, oh, let's go back to it.
[47:59.36]I don't want to do that.
[48:02.52]Imagine if we were in the middle of a fucking heated moment, and all of a sudden I just paused the game and just started saying names.
[48:11.86]I don't want to do that.
[48:14.24]Is there anything else up here I can do?
[48:18.67]Because it takes away from, like, the flow of the game.
[48:20.77]The flow of the stream.
[48:21.79]The flow of, like... If, like, there's something funny going on.
[48:25.35]Or something interesting that, like, we're talking about.
[48:27.21]Like, that I don't want to get, like, interrupted.
[48:28.59]You know what I mean?
[48:32.09]And then, like, somebody just wrote, like, just acknowledge landmarks.
[48:36.67]And that's potentially a good idea.
[48:40.10]Like, get, like, the first month, and then, like, the third, or, like, six months or something.
[48:44.40]I don't know.
[48:45.52]I don't want you guys to think I don't care.
[48:46.77]And where am I going?
[48:53.33]I never want you guys to think I don't care.
[48:54.83]Because, like, you guys obviously are the ones, like, supporting the stream.
[48:57.87]And, like, paying me money and shit.
[49:00.56]Like, I don't want you to think that that's not, like... You know, some of you guys have been subscribed for fucking, like, more than a year.
[49:06.64]That's a huge deal.
[49:09.10]I don't want you to think that I'm devaluing you or something by not saying your name or acknowledging you, but I just don't want it to take over the broadcast.
[49:20.68]I missed the room.
[49:21.78]I'm a fucking idiot.
[49:29.65]What's the point of bringing a gun if you don't know how to shoot it?
[49:39.72]Ride or die.
[49:42.40]Can I do something in here now that I couldn't do before?
[49:45.60]I guess I can hold this fucking... Why would you hold this this close to paper?
[49:50.23]There's none in there.
[50:06.31]Do I just go backwards?
[50:13.40]No, I already went this way.
[50:14.18]Fuck.
[50:19.86]I was walking around in circles, reading and talking.
[50:22.18]And now I don't remember where the hell I was going.
[50:27.20]Can't open this door, right?
[50:28.98]Oh no, maybe I can.
[50:31.02]I'm gonna have to shoot it off.
[50:32.72]Okay, here we go, guys.
[50:33.98]You ready?
[50:34.36]Guess what worked that time when I pressed R2?
[50:37.77]Everybody was giving me shit about press X. It was just R2.
[50:46.97]Oh, wait a minute.
[50:49.29]Hey, big guy.
[50:50.59]Yeah, we're friends.
[50:53.65]Happy to see me again, huh?
[50:55.47]Oh, we're fucking friends.
[50:56.27]I'm so glad.
[50:56.75]Hey.
[50:58.17]Put that gun away.
[50:58.81]I was hoping I'd run into you again.
[51:00.43]Alright.
[51:03.96]Good boy.
[51:04.56]These things are like probably the Wendigos.
[51:06.32]Alright, pal.
[51:07.62]Come with me.
[51:09.02]Alright.
[51:10.24]Here's the plan.
[51:10.82]I happen to see a map of this place, so we're not flying blind.
[51:16.04]There should be a way through the psychiatric wing that'll take us right outside the mine.
[51:22.89]Think you can handle that?
[51:23.59]I hope he doesn't turn on me.
[51:24.53]Couldn't have said it better myself.
[51:26.47]Get out of the way.
[51:31.89]The Wendigo is going to be like, if you get bit by a dog, these dogs are like the ancient secret Native American dogs or something, that they have like the strange, they have the magic in the mountain or something, and if you get bit by one of these dogs, then you turn into a Wendigo eventually.
[51:45.10]I mean, the Wendigo people are like werewolves.
[51:47.48]It's going to be one of those coming-of-age stories about like the, I mean, not a coming-of-age story, you know what I'm talking about, like the werewolf coming-of-age story, not a human coming-of-age story.
[51:59.81]Wendigo is Native American for dog.
[52:02.05]So, I mean, that makes sense.
[52:04.17]It's a literal, direct translation from Native American.
[52:06.53]Wendigo.
[52:07.53]Is dog.
[52:07.87]Whoa, slow down.
[52:08.99]Native American.
[52:33.09]That is not true.
[52:36.49]I know it's not true.
[52:38.29]That's why I said it.
[52:39.16]I shouldn't have eaten that fucking pie at Thanksgiving, because now I can't get through the door.
[52:52.58]There we go.
[52:54.73]Why am I calling him Wolfie?
[53:02.21]I can't trust the dog.
[53:03.13]He's definitely two wendigos in a dog costume.
[53:18.92]Detention area.
[53:20.27]I used to have detention all the time.
[53:24.80]I was one of those kids in high school and middle school that I was always in detention.
[53:29.72]Always.
[53:30.42]And it was awful.
[53:31.12]It was so bad.
[53:31.72]Because I had to take the late bus.
[53:34.34]Huh.
[53:36.29]They showed to be dead.
[53:39.53]Okay.
[53:42.71]Who remembers the late bus from high school?
[53:45.85]They had one last sorry ass bus at like 4 o'clock for all the fucking degenerate kids.
[53:50.86]I was one of them.
[53:55.52]Oh boy.
[53:57.42]Oh god, see?
[54:06.84]Hell yeah, late bus boys.
[54:08.47]Yeah, see?
[54:18.01]You were always in detention because you made noises?
[54:19.69]I was always in detention because I just didn't pay attention and I would like, make like a snarky, swanky comment.
[54:29.77]That's gotta be one of the worst words in the English dictionary.
[54:48.76]Well, there's a wendigo right there.
[54:50.46]I see that on the right.
[54:53.78]Wendigo or you could just call it like a default first area Dark Souls 3 enemy.
[55:02.41]Please give me the tutorial zombies from Dark Souls.
[55:05.81]He's gonna be like right here.
[55:13.14]What's a swanky comment?
[55:15.00]One that, like, after you're done saying it, like, the two people at the desk to your left and your right are like, yeah, put their fucking hands up and you, like, slap their hands and then you get in trouble.
[55:23.88]Like, you know, like, at least the teacher gave you the benefit of the doubt to, like, get those high fives before picking the phone up and saying that you're coming to the office.
[55:30.80]You know?
[55:34.84]Like, bang, slap this guy's hand.
[55:36.60]Bang, slap that guy's hand.
[55:37.80]She picks up the phone.
[55:39.08]Uh, Jeremy will be in the office in about five minutes.
[55:52.15]Why wouldn't I be moving faster than this?
[55:53.95]I don't... I like this game, but I wish there was a slightly run button.
[56:01.73]So if you're not friendly to the dog, I'm gonna assume this dog is gonna save me and he's gonna die and it's gonna be really fucking sad.
[56:08.78]Wait, nobody else is allowed... Ha!
[56:10.80]Nobody can die, right?
[56:13.09]Should I, I don't think, should I, should I, it's probably just a rat.
[56:15.19]It's gonna be a rat.
[56:15.91]Don't shoot.
[56:16.97]It's gonna be like a fucking bug or something.
[56:18.47]See?
[56:19.03]I knew it.
[56:24.25]That worked!
[56:30.37]Don't close the dog out.
[56:40.58]Go straight ahead.
[56:43.58]I got a dog.
[56:44.08]Come on, where's the dog?
[56:46.35]Don't close the dog out!
[56:48.45]Can I wait for the dog?
[56:50.21]Oh, what the fuck?
[56:52.23]These are miners.
[57:04.61]I... He's like locked in here.
[57:10.03]But where's the dog?
[57:17.38]I'm in darkness now.
[57:20.47]God.
[57:24.51]Am I just locked in here?
[57:32.22]He's in the other cell.
[57:33.54]We're like inmates.
[57:36.19]Wait, what?
[57:44.08]I'm getting ready to shoot it.
[57:59.75]Why did that not work?
[58:03.81]Why didn't this work last time?
[58:05.45]I don't understand.
[58:06.09]Like when I fucking was clearly pressing R2.
[58:09.13]I should have two other survivors.
[58:16.65]Mike has had, like, the hardest life so far.
[58:19.32]Wait, what?
[58:25.70]What?
[58:27.70]What?
[58:28.45]Oh.
[58:30.09]Wait, the dog is here.
[58:31.35]I have the dog in here right now.
[58:35.35]Oh, hey, by the way, I was here.
[58:46.29]God Watch these all be end up being like presidents That's right, we're talking about this like 30 minus right there were 30 presidents up until this point wasn't there I Was about to sneeze
[59:14.22]I didn't do that.
[59:18.20]Oh my god, my whole body's itchy.
[59:19.58]I hope I don't have to go and move.
[59:33.25]Good sneaking.
[59:34.81]Dammit.
[59:40.76]Son of a bitch.
[59:46.29]The dog really hasn't done much.
[59:47.47]He's kind of just walking around with me.
[59:59.61]Is the dog like a character now?
[60:00.93]Does he count if he dies?
[60:01.97]I hope he doesn't.
[60:04.71]I hope he becomes like my best friend.
[60:06.00]I know he's not going to.
[60:06.82]They're gonna ruin it for me.
[60:08.00]They're gonna make me really sad.
[60:25.99]Follow the dog!
[60:28.92]Follow the dog!
[60:32.22]Now they really are in a haunted house.
[60:39.22]This is the most gameplay this game has had in like seven and a half hours.
[61:01.33]What?
[61:09.02]I don't know why, what do you mean why am I shooting?
[61:10.66]Because fucking, I don't know.
[61:15.22]Okay, don't shoot, then I'm not gonna shoot then.
[61:19.96]Okay, I didn't shoot.
[61:23.39]I'm wasting ammo.
[61:24.11]I don't know, guys.
[61:25.19]I don't know if I could, like, break through.
[61:26.82]Oh, God.
[61:32.58]Come on!
[61:33.20]Oh, God.
[61:36.68]Not good.
[61:52.35]I have enough bullets, right?
[62:00.69]Um... Um... Shoot it, shoot it, shoot it!
[62:09.92]Blow it up!
[62:10.72]This is where we're gonna blow it up, and we're gonna fucking double kill.
[62:14.76]Okay!
[62:20.85]Okay, we're good.
[62:21.47]Where's the dog?
[62:24.69]Where's the dog?
[62:31.69]Where's the dog?
[62:32.55]Oh, no.
[62:33.29]Alright, time to go.
[62:38.08]Goodbye, dog.
[62:41.04]No, he's okay, right?
[62:44.58]I think he's okay.
[62:45.40]I hope he's okay.
[62:50.00]I really hope I have bullets in this.
[62:55.09]Please take your time going up the stairs.
[62:56.81]It's as if, you know what?
[62:58.41]It's really as if all these characters have like 40 pound shoes.
[63:03.05]They want to be running, but they just can't.
[63:06.61]I wish I wasn't wearing these heavy fucking boots.
[63:09.79]Seriously.
[63:10.30]I can hear someone sprinting around right now.
[63:27.53]I can hear these fucking things everywhere.
[63:30.91]I'm just, I'm just moving.
[63:37.64]Come on, get me out of here.
[63:43.52]Fuck!
[63:44.42]That was worth it.
[63:51.72]That's what I think that was worth it was.
[63:59.94]Barricade it, barricade it, barricade it, come on.
[64:02.32]I ain't gonna fucking play that game, barricade the door.
[64:06.41]I had time there.
[64:10.39]Hey buddy.
[64:13.97]What?
[64:14.38]Come on down.
[64:16.28]Sorry.
[64:17.20]Why would he?
[64:19.02]He just keeps showing up.
[64:22.30]I'll catch you on the flip side, huh?
[64:23.70]Huh?
[64:29.36]Where has it been?
[64:33.08]That was the dumbest run I've ever seen.
[64:36.13]I can run way- I'm gonna- I'm gonna reshoot the pulse- Fuck.
[64:40.37]Quiet.
[64:44.81]What?
[64:45.17]What?
[64:45.55]What?
[64:45.99]What?
[64:49.22]Oh my god!
[64:49.70]I'm gonna shoot this barrel!
[64:59.82]I got it.
[65:02.40]I got it.
[65:02.96]I did it.
[65:05.98]I win.
[65:07.58]I beat these fucking monsters.
[65:11.73]I don't get it.
[65:14.13]Do their souls come out screaming?
[65:22.75]No, the dog is alive.
[65:23.51]Remember, he got out.
[65:25.84]He was like, hey, go get out of here.
[65:27.32]And he went the other way.
[65:28.34]He got out.
[65:31.36]The dog definitely got out fine, I guess.
[65:36.37]Now this is Jessica.
[65:37.33]Yeah, Jessica's not dead.
[65:39.85]She's very much alive.
[65:49.75]That was the dog reaching his hand out.
[65:58.32]Alright, give me one second.
[65:59.12]I gotta pee.
[66:00.29]I gotta refill my fucking coffee here.
[66:04.47]Give me one second.

[70:56.53]I don't know.
[70:59.50]Oh, yeah, I forgot about Matt.

[71:56.28]Almost there.
[71:59.67]And...
[72:05.77]Here they come.
[72:06.87]No, don't Windows update.
[72:08.41]Don't Windows update.
[72:10.42]Do not Windows update.
[72:11.62]I turned this off.
[72:14.54]Turn it off.
[72:15.38]I don't fucking want it.
[72:20.95]Fucking Windows update.
[72:25.16]Alright, I gotta... Alright, no more jokes.
[72:28.64]Hold on.
[72:29.16]I, like, actually got terrified that my Windows update was gonna fucking... My, like, heart stopped.
[72:34.76]I saw the Windows update thing.
[72:39.10]Hurry up and get down there!
[72:39.98]How long does it take you to get down a fucking ladder?
[72:41.76]Jeez, I could fall down there and be fine.
[72:51.12]This streamer is funny.
[72:57.64]The stream died?
[72:58.72]Oh god, I hope not.
[73:00.84]We should close this?
[73:03.01]That means I should play this in reverse.
[73:07.49]I'm not closing it.
[73:10.81]I don't want to close it.
[73:13.87]But what if we lock ourselves in?
[73:22.94]But what if one of those weird monkey werewolves comes?
[73:26.28]See?
[73:27.69]Now I'm lost.
[73:28.23]Now I don't have anybody with me.
[73:29.64]Wait a minute.
[73:30.20]I'll check the fucking back here.
[73:32.96]I know what you guys are doing.
[73:34.32]I don't think I can see stream chat.
[73:40.24]I know what... I know what you're doing over there, stream chat!
[73:48.65]You're saying all kinds of mean comments.
[73:54.01]Come on.
[73:55.63]You know what I was trying to do.
[74:00.79]Mud.
[74:07.95]She sees us hide.
[74:22.86]And this is why you don't split up.
[74:24.60]Who's there?
[74:29.64]Anybody?
[74:31.14]There were three of us.
[74:33.04]There were three people here.
[74:39.08]I'm gonna investigate the voice.
[74:41.56]Let's do the horror trope.
[74:50.79]That was way too far of a fall.
[74:52.63]Investigate the voice.
[74:54.67]I did the worst possible fucking thing I could do.
[74:58.94]But sometimes like the obvious don't do it is like the thing you're supposed to do, right?
[75:13.45]Well, at least it's gonna do the right button combinations and I won't be dead.
[75:22.68]See?
[75:22.94]Look at this.
[75:24.12]It's gonna give me the answer to all my riddles.
[75:31.25]That's somebody's head being, like, exploded.
[75:35.40]Loss of a friend.
[75:38.24]Alright, well... Now, I was gonna just say something, but I'm not gonna give any spoilers for any TV shows.
[75:45.06]I'm not gonna give any TV show spoilers.
[75:46.60]You know what TV show I'm about to refer to?
[75:48.63]Don't say it.
[75:49.77]Like, that's a TV show spoiler.
[75:51.13]Like, remember in that TV show?
[75:52.79]Very popular, like, Emmy-winning TV show.
[75:55.17]Don't worry.
[75:55.59]You guys know what I'm talking about.
[76:09.04]Alright, well somebody's like in here.
[76:10.54]I'm not opening this.
[76:13.31]Why would I open this?
[76:14.45]Are you serious?
[76:15.23]No.
[76:15.89]This is like How to Die 101.
[76:21.43]Right?
[76:25.62]I can't open that.
[76:30.98]No.
[76:32.48]That's such a bad idea.
[76:33.62]Open it.
[76:33.86]Open it.
[76:34.28]Open it.
[76:34.76]No.
[76:34.88]I'm not opening it.
[76:38.48]That's how the character dies, don't you guys understand that?
[76:40.94]I'm going.
[76:57.45]There was a gun- See, look at that!
[76:59.95]Look at that.
[77:00.55]I'm good.
[77:03.16]We're back together.
[77:06.98]Look at that.
[77:09.60]Why would you ever open a trapdoor that's shaking like that?
[77:16.36]Worst case scenario, it's a wendigo.
[77:19.01]Best case scenario, it's like a fucking snake.
[77:21.49]And the outcome is still the same.
[77:23.21]It's not the dog.
[77:23.87]It's not the dog!
[77:42.15]A snake in the snow.
[77:48.91]But you don't know that.
[77:51.89]It's not the dog.
[77:55.75]What?
[77:56.83]Oh, I thought that was Mike.
[78:05.55]What was the point of seeing that?
[78:07.93]Oh, there's a huge fly on my screen right now.
[78:09.71]Get the fuck out of here.
[78:11.81]Get out of here.
[78:14.07]Oh my God, he's like red.
[78:15.53]What does a red fly mean?
[78:17.23]Somebody look this up.
[78:19.51]Like red fly.
[78:20.59]Is this gonna bite me?
[78:23.35]I'm gonna get like fucking bit by this thing, aren't I?
[78:28.74]He's like fucking swirling around me.
[78:32.80]It's a death totem.
[78:36.22]It's deadly.
[78:46.50]He's fucking freaking me out.
[78:50.62]It's a wendigo.
[78:57.33]You always have to do the hard one.
[78:58.89]It means it goes faster.
[79:01.33]And you escape all the scary animals.
[79:03.41]And the annoying flies.
[79:10.64]Oh, he's swirling around my head.
[79:12.78]I can hear him.
[79:14.56]I have full 5.1 stereo of this fly circling my fucking brain right now.
[79:21.29]I'll catch him in my mouth if I have to.
[79:22.63]You know what I mean?
[79:23.57]He's so annoying, I will try to eat him.
[79:25.27]And I'll spit him out onto the ground.
[79:40.58]God damn it.
[79:51.71]Fucking fly.
[79:52.35]These, like, red murder flies.
[79:59.07]What is this?
[80:00.41]What am I looking at here?
[80:05.29]No.
[80:05.77]I was too busy, like, looking at the fucking fly.
[80:14.02]Should I just drop down?
[80:14.80]I paid a thousand dollars to eat the fly.
[80:18.87]No.
[80:21.03]Wait a minute, let me look.
[80:26.43]I'm going this way.
[80:31.77]Can you guys, like, hear him?
[80:32.69]He's, like, fucking... He's smashing into walls and shit.
[80:37.72]This is not gonna, like, actually collapse on me, is it?
[80:43.32]I blame this fucking fly for if I picked the wrong decision.
[80:45.84]I didn't have a chance to look.
[80:52.05]Literally, I would have had a more conscious decision.
[80:55.83]Instead, this obnoxious fly.
[80:57.69]Fuck flies.
[80:58.19]I hope they all go away forever.
[81:00.55]What purpose do they serve?
[81:01.97]Nothing.
[81:02.22]They're just annoying.
[81:11.66]I have, like, my window open over here.
[81:13.16]That's, like, one, like, got in.
[81:14.78]Cool.
[81:16.26]What is that?
[81:21.12]That's something just, like, screamed in my... But why are we all separated again?
[81:28.81]Think of the frogs.
[81:32.15]Yeah, well, I mean, the frogs are fine, but...
[81:37.99]How do we get him away from our houses?
[81:40.33]He flew in this window.
[81:50.59]Oh, God.
[81:52.91]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[81:57.34]Oh, he's gonna smash my head.
[81:59.72]Nice.
[82:01.44]I can't aim down that far.
[82:11.23]Using the gun as a prop there.
[82:15.43]Windows update is seriously... Okay, I'm going to pick a time.
[82:18.25]Alive.
[82:19.19]How about next fucking Saturday?
[82:22.81]Get the fuck out of here.
[82:23.81]How the hell are you doing here anyway?
[82:24.81]I was going to warn you about the Wendigos.
[82:28.13]I think I got it.
[82:29.33]Let's find a way down to where this fucking was.
[82:31.57]Give me a break.
[82:36.37]We're good.
[82:39.80]Guys, I'm just gonna warn you here.
[82:41.44]Very loud.
[82:41.78]I'm about to crush the fucking fly on my desk.
[82:45.02]Okay.
[82:45.18]Everybody, I'm gonna mute and I'm gonna give you an update if I got it.
[82:52.28]Here we go.
[82:52.96]Shh, quiet.
[82:53.44]I didn't get him.
[82:54.18]I didn't get him.
[82:54.60]I did not get him.
[83:10.27]Now he's angry.
[83:12.11]Now he's fucking angry.
[83:12.79]I'm gonna get that key right from that thing's goddamn bedroom, and then I'm gonna get us all the hell out of here.
[83:19.09]Holy shit!
[83:19.35]I was so confident, dude.
[83:26.70]Let's find a way down to where this fucking is.
[83:27.98]The nature's not gonna be balanced.
[83:28.92]Well, I didn't get it, so... Don't worry.
[83:39.51]One hour Until Dawn.
[83:40.99]We're at the last possible chapter, I think.
[83:43.01]Maybe one more after this.
[83:44.01]Are we going to find out what the fuck this guy's deal is?
[83:58.74]I really want to know.
[84:01.72]I wonder how much these sessions are of any help to you now.
[84:08.68]Just won't listen to me and things seems pretty... fucked up.
[84:21.57]So I'm gonna leave you now, Josh.
[84:24.75]It's time you learned there's more to be afraid of that can be dreamt up by the unhinged imagination of a self-indulgent, spoiled little brat!
[84:36.80]You had so many people who cared about you.
[84:39.04]Who were willing to help!
[84:41.65]But at every turn, you choose to push them away, and now you're all alone.
[84:47.59]This is just like a, geez, like an imagination character.
[84:49.99]Well, by the sounds of things, you won't be alone for long.
[84:54.82]This is like his old psychiatrist from like fucking 20 years ago.
[84:57.70]No, you won't be alone for long.
[84:59.90]Imagine the whole thing.
[85:00.78]Deep breaths, Josh.
[85:23.15]No, no, no, no, not again.
[85:27.80]Not again.
[85:29.04]No, get away.
[85:30.66]Get away!
[85:32.28]You have the spiders, right?
[85:34.02]Get away from me!
[85:37.72]No, you're dead!
[85:39.49]Sorry.
[85:40.25]You're dead!
[85:41.19]Shut up!
[85:42.19]We miss you.
[85:44.93]No, you're dead!
[85:47.99]We miss you already.
[85:50.01]So he's like a multi-personality, right?
[85:52.41]I trust you
[86:14.61]gonna be like multiple personality like josh has like two personalities one of them's like the psycho the other ones you're all alone down there just stay in the light all alone so you're with us now family
[86:41.36]It's not real.
[86:45.80]Where the fuck are we?
[86:46.52]Are we like inside like a stomach?
[87:05.37]What the fuck is that?
[87:10.56]Is it a snake?
[87:12.64]You just punched the pig in the face.
[87:19.38]Alright, let's be honest.
[87:20.92]What the fuck is going on?
[87:28.15]They turned into like a monster.
[87:30.75]I don't take orders from you.
[87:36.94]No, it was just a skeleton the whole time.
[87:40.34]It wasn't actually bad.
[87:43.06]It was a scary skeleton.
[87:44.76]That was nice.
[87:45.80]Who is this supposed to be?
[88:07.41]Alright, well.
[88:09.53]We're still going.
[88:10.23]We're still going.
[88:12.19]I'm gonna do a lot of weird shit, sorry.
[88:13.69]Yeah.
[88:41.26]Smooth move, dude.
[88:42.64]Oh, wait, I'm not controlling the guy with the light.
[88:44.50]Oh, she has a light, too.
[88:45.24]Um... We can look at this shiny thing.
[88:57.19]Oh, alright.
[88:59.55]Let's see.
[89:00.07]The whole house is on fire.
[89:07.64]How is that a good fortune?
[89:11.64]Good fortune.
[89:14.80]The whole house is burning down.
[89:16.45]Okay.
[89:21.99]Give me the drop down, I'm assuming.
[89:25.17]Yeah, let's go.
[89:26.07]Oh, it's acid!
[89:32.81]Come on, it's okay.
[89:34.51]I would lap my ass up if it's serious with acid.
[89:36.14]They both make their head skin just like melt off.
[89:41.58]Obviously very cold.
[89:46.88]Okay, let's go.
[89:56.23]Wasn't there a premonition about this wheel?
[90:00.96]If I remember correctly.
[90:01.84]The water wheel here.
[90:06.73]We're both doing our best Frankenstein impression, I like that.
[90:15.23]Also, if you jump into that water, aren't you freaking the fuck out to try to get to the other side as fast as you can?
[90:22.61]I am going as fast as possible, like, frantically going through that water.
[90:32.64]Where did these heads come from?
[90:37.88]Jesus.
[90:38.52]What?
[90:38.86]Oh, God.
[90:39.40]Oh, here comes another one.
[90:42.60]Yeah.
[90:43.04]Buddies.
[90:59.89]It's only two bodies though.
[91:00.87]This is where it shows you all the bodies from the game that you've lost.
[91:04.23]I've only lost two because of R2.
[91:05.67]Just move!
[91:13.04]Why do people do this in horror movies and stuff?
[91:15.06]Just go!
[91:18.56]How many of you guys are in a full sprint right now?
[91:26.35]Why are you going in here?
[91:27.95]This is not good.
[91:29.19]I don't like this.
[91:29.81]He's gonna fucking try to kill us.
[91:58.89]Josh!
[92:00.73]Mike.
[92:01.59]Josh!
[92:02.75]Hey, man.
[92:03.76]Don't hit me, please.
[92:07.18]You were deep in it, man.
[92:08.84]Full mental jacket.
[92:09.88]We didn't think we'd get you back.
[92:10.94]Full mental jacket?
[92:11.62]Let's just get the fuck out of here.
[92:13.66]Okay, Josh, do you have the key for the cable car?
[92:16.66]Where is Matt?
[92:17.62]Is Matt the fucking killer?
[92:18.66]He's been gone for like fucking four hours.
[92:20.30]Oh, God.
[92:25.20]See that over there?
[92:27.72]That means there's a direct way out.
[92:29.03]Come on.
[92:30.43]Alright, we got to get some action here.
[92:31.97]There's been a whole lot of doing.
[92:32.79]There's been a whole lot of nothing.
[92:33.59]There's no way, Josh.
[92:34.17]This is supposed to be the climax of the whole series.
[92:35.97]Okay, if you help me up, I can go back and tell the others, okay?
[92:37.99]I'm just kind of walking around in circles.
[92:39.81]Yeah, yeah, good.
[92:41.83]You bring Josh back the way we came, and we'll all meet at the lodge.
[92:45.13]Be careful.
[92:46.35]Yeah, you too.
[92:50.50]Josh.
[92:51.50]Aren't there like two other characters we haven't seen and haven't like been near in a long time?
[93:03.48]Look at greasy shoes.
[93:05.78]I love how I get to control this character.
[93:09.38]Should I like role play as him?
[93:10.40]I think I have to do the things that he would do, right?
[93:20.03]If it gives me an option to, like, snap neck of Mike in front of me, I'm gonna have to do it.
[93:24.88]Right?
[93:25.46]Like, that's the character.
[93:26.80]I'm acting right now as the character.
[93:34.32]Do it?
[93:35.38]Yes.
[93:37.96]Yeah, I mean, like, that's what would happen, right?
[93:42.99]You shouldn't give me choices to make.
[93:45.09]If the choices... I'm, like, a crazy guy, you know what I mean?
[93:55.04]I want to pick up one of the totems as Josh.
[94:02.24]What happened to the girl?
[94:03.90]Why are we doing this again?
[94:04.76]Uh oh.
[94:08.46]No, here it comes.
[94:09.24]That's an extremely odd way to be holding that flashlight.
[94:20.43]Why is he doing like an Olympic statue?
[94:25.25]It's like he's doing like a javelin.
[94:29.91]Here we come, we're the monsters.
[94:31.39]Alright, bye.
[94:36.52]He is real.
[94:37.58]Yes he is.
[94:38.20]Oh wait, I've seen this, I've seen this, I've seen this, we've seen this.
[94:57.13]How was I supposed to prevent that?
[94:59.65]I couldn't prevent that.
[95:01.21]What?
[95:04.44]Could I have prevented that?
[95:11.46]Okay.
[95:12.94]Hey, wait, here he is, here he is.
[95:18.05]So that was Hannah.
[95:19.39]Hannah's one of the Wendigos.
[95:20.55]There's like 40 of them.
[95:29.44]What did I just pick?
[95:30.00]Did I just pick up a rock?
[95:32.64]No, it's a lighter.
[95:35.10]It's a fucking Zippo.
[95:36.82]Should've hit R2.
[95:37.38]Wait, wait, hey!
[95:41.79]Wait, what the fuck?
[95:44.01]Why is she... Just how many sisters does this guy have?
[96:03.20]She just broke that shovel over his arm and he's fine.
[96:06.26]What if I didn't let that happen?
[96:09.00]What if I just took my head off?
[96:12.94]I don't trust this girl at all.
[96:14.12]She's the one that got sucked out of the window, right?
[96:33.01]I'm sorry, like, you get sucked out of a window.
[96:34.90]From a wendigo.
[96:39.90]I don't trust you for a second.
[96:40.90]Look at the way she's walking, too.
[96:42.82]She's walking like she's pretending to be a human.
[96:44.84]You know when a toddler first learns how to walk?
[96:49.82]It's a wendigo.
[96:50.70]She's a fucking wendigo.
[96:51.80]What?
[96:51.94]You fell this far?
[97:01.85]It's a long way to fall.
[97:02.51]I don't know, man.
[97:05.96]I don't know.
[97:07.08]It's true.
[97:31.62]Uh, let's go this way.
[97:38.66]She's going to do the thing from Dead Space 2.
[97:40.48]You guys remember Dead Space 2?
[97:43.48]The first, like, five minutes?
[97:45.23]The guy that's like, we're gonna get you out of here, Isaac!
[97:46.99]And he's like... And he, like, fucking gets ripped apart and, like, turns into one of those things.
[97:51.55]It's gonna happen.
[97:54.97]Dead Space 2 spoilers.
[97:56.99]He's been up for, like, fucking nine years.
[98:04.01]Like, look, my record for, like, here's my stance on this.
[98:11.42]If a piece of media has been out for five years, like, that's when it loses.
[98:16.50]That's like the statue of spoiler limitations.
[98:20.33]You know what I mean?
[98:22.28]Because, I mean, like, come on.
[98:23.28]I can't believe you spoiled that for me!
[98:25.16]It's been five years.
[98:27.24]That game's been on the Steam sale, like, fucking five fucking times for, like, two bucks.
[98:31.37]Come on.
[98:31.55]Ahhh!
[98:33.35]Should I have done that?
[98:43.34]I have to- I got the light.
[98:55.50]Died with a limp.
[98:57.88]Why was that for me?
[99:00.36]Oh, first square to grab her.
[99:01.54]Does this hurt?
[99:04.22]Alright.
[99:10.32]Alright.
[99:12.63]Let's get going.
[99:13.83]We gotta do this.
[99:15.31]Get out of here.
[99:15.85]Come on.
[99:18.68]Jess, come on.
[99:21.12]Come on, come on.
[99:21.64]My stances don't do it because Psycho was spoiled for me, and I can never see that for me.
[99:26.85]Jess, come on.
[99:29.47]She's done.
[99:29.91]Like, you know what?
[99:30.65]I'm sorry.
[99:31.21]I can barely breathe.
[99:35.83]Ah!
[99:37.49]Alright, fine, fine.
[99:38.33]We'll try it.
[99:38.74]We'll just... Okay...
[99:59.89]leave her.
[100:00.49]I was about to.
[100:02.65]We're safe for now.
[100:08.61]No, here's she.
[100:09.33]She's fucking on the side of a mountain.
[100:14.55]She climbed all that way without a harness.
[100:16.25]I want you to think about that.
[100:19.55]No, we're not jumping.
[100:20.41]It's way too slippery.
[100:23.08]That's such a bad idea.
[100:24.36]I ain't taking the quick way.
[100:27.86]Not when it's this dangerous.
[100:32.08]Keep going.
[100:39.06]Almost fucked that one up.
[100:40.02]Good thing I got it.
[100:48.97]It's taking longer, though.
[100:52.43]I love how careful you're being now.
[100:53.87]Well, yeah, I mean, come on.
[100:56.50]We're at the very end of the game.
[100:57.88]There's probably another 30 to 40 minutes of gameplay.
[101:01.54]I want to try to win.
[101:03.44]I want to get one of the good endings.
[101:04.98]Let's go this way.
[101:14.57]Everybody would be alive right now if it wasn't for R2-D2.
[101:16.81]You know what I mean?
[101:20.85]Yeah, Chris died because of a gameplay malfunction.
[101:23.15]Not because of something I did.
[101:34.41]Better than average ending.
[101:38.79]Ooh, a gold coin.
[101:42.05]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[101:43.51]No, I thought... I didn't even see this.
[101:45.86]What's with the fucking water?
[101:47.32]Get out of the cold water.
[101:48.44]There's gotta be a better way to go.
[101:49.86]Oh, she's dead.
[101:51.62]I think I may have blown it here, guys, by going in the water.
[101:57.14]This one's gonna jump up right in my face.
[102:00.14]Here it comes, yep.
[102:05.34]So it's gonna grab my leg and pull me back down.
[102:07.18]No?
[102:07.24]Wow.
[102:10.34]Alright.
[102:11.42]We're good.
[102:13.00]Okay.
[102:18.27]Go!
[102:20.81]If you're going to be wet, that's what's gonna happen.
[102:26.17]Look, at least Sam is the smart one.
[102:28.62]She brought one of those mining helmets.
[102:30.70]Headband lights.
[102:31.58]I mean, that's so important.
[102:40.97]Sloppy, but you're still okay.
[102:42.47]He's very sloppy, but you're good.
[102:49.05]I want one of these headband lights.
[102:50.56]Those things are cool.
[102:55.64]I would get mine to be like... Alright, now she decides to run.
[103:08.99]Oh, she looks back and smashes me in the head.
[103:12.54]That definitely would have happened.
[103:17.71]There's a lot of those random little, like, eight-foot drops.
[103:30.96]What?
[103:31.52]What?
[103:31.90]That's not Mike.
[103:32.62]Were you guys lying to me or is this like the thing?
[103:35.76]Where like it could be anybody?
[104:01.15]She did that so close.
[104:03.91]Back up a few feet.
[104:04.99]What the fuck are you thinking?
[104:10.88]She just like slit her whole arm open.
[104:13.74]I feel like he's the monster.
[104:23.12]Don't you guys feel like he's the monster?
[104:24.70]What do you think we should do?
[104:29.84]We should check the basement.
[104:32.12]Might be someone left down there.
[104:33.64]Check the basement, right.
[104:35.00]Okay.
[104:35.40]He's a fucking Wendigo.
[104:39.02]You got, like, it was very clear, like, Wendigos can, like, fucking transform and shit, like you guys were saying.
[104:43.61]Because look at all, like, look at the times where, like, there's been a random person that just got, like, transformed.
[104:48.89]And it was not the person actually talking or something, right?
[104:54.40]I'm fucking hitting this guy in the head with a shovel.
[104:55.82]This is a Wendigo.
[104:58.08]Like, every time the camera changes, the directions change, which I'm able to move.
[105:04.96]He's gonna turn and be right in my face and grab me and go... You know, like fucking scream.
[105:13.44]How do you rate our chances of survival?
[105:15.72]5%.
[105:16.50]I'm trying not to think about it.
[105:18.80]You hear it like that, like... Run!
[105:21.02]Run!
[105:21.70]Wow!
[105:30.88]Don't move okay.
[105:32.22]Oh
[106:17.13]My ass is itchy so bad!
[106:19.27]Oh my god, my itchy ass!
[106:20.59]Okay.
[106:22.39]My whole fucking body itches!
[106:29.28]Why does this happen?
[106:30.10]Anytime you can't move, your whole body starts to itch.
[106:34.64]Why does this happen?
[106:41.73]What the fuck was that?
[106:46.04]He just did like a bam bam.
[106:50.06]Oh shit, gas.
[106:56.29]We gotta get the fuck out of here.
[107:02.29]Don't turn on any lights.
[107:10.76]Like, alright, honest to God.
[107:14.74]Don't move.
[107:22.79]Oh my God.
[107:28.25]Don't, what are you doing?
[107:40.40]Good!
[107:40.76]Ow!
[107:40.88]That was a mistake, but she's gonna get away.
[107:59.05]Oh.
[108:01.03]Ahhhh.
[108:03.63]Ahhhh.
[108:05.89]Ahhhhhhhhhh.
[108:11.15]Save him.
[108:11.45]I didn't get- What?
[108:13.21]What?
[108:13.43]What?
[108:13.75]What are you screaming?
[108:14.79]I thought you were gonna throw like a stick.
[108:18.37]Oh, well there's two.
[108:19.01]We got two out.
[108:24.99]Okay, we're good.
[108:35.71]Two people got out.
[108:39.27]You can't run for the switch right now.
[108:45.09]You can't run for the switch.
[108:47.84]I mean, there'll be more in stock in like February.
[108:49.86]Don't worry.
[108:50.24]I'm gonna make a joke.
[108:58.96]I'm... I'm... What?
[109:00.98]No!
[109:01.90]Oh, shit!
[109:03.00]What the fuck?
[109:03.61]I wasn't moving!
[109:04.85]Ugh!
[109:06.94]That's a fucking Nintendo joke.
[109:13.08]Oh, come on God damn it
[109:29.95]Run for the switch.
[109:30.67]I was gonna make, like, a Black Friday joke where it's like, oh, sorry, you don't have to, like, run for it.
[109:34.11]They'll be more in stock after Christmas.
[109:35.47]We have visual.
[109:36.17]The main structure is completely destroyed.
[109:41.03]Over.
[109:42.51]I'm seeing something.
[109:44.84]Hey, it's alright.
[109:45.46]Looks like there are survivors.
[109:49.02]Let's pick them up.
[109:51.08]Did I win?
[109:55.96]I won.
[109:57.96]I made it to dawn.
[110:06.46]That's it?
[110:07.10]Wait, that's like the end of the game?
[110:08.90]Where's like the ending?
[110:15.22]Did I get like the bad ending?
[110:25.92]Everybody lived.
[110:28.43]Only like a couple people died.
[110:29.63]And she died because I fucking had like an itchy nose.
[110:41.67]Everybody lived.
[110:43.59]I can't believe Chris is gone.
[110:47.35]No, police interview.
[110:48.51]He was my best friend, and maybe I... We never had a chance.
[110:56.91]You know, here's the thing.
[110:58.01]Everybody would have lived.
[110:58.89]He held it right up to my face.
[111:01.23]Right here, right in front of my nose, and he could have shot me.
[111:04.13]He almost shot me, the prick.
[111:05.73]I mean, you go out with a guy for however long, and you think you know him, but man, this one really takes the cake.
[111:11.55]I'm blaming two of those deaths on the fucking R2.
[111:13.44]I was right there, and I could have done something.
[111:17.92]I tried to do something.
[111:22.30]It wasn't good enough.
[111:23.92]It's never good enough.
[111:25.39]How did you end up in the mines?
[111:27.87]I don't know.
[111:28.23]I was carried and taken and... What did you see?
[111:37.51]I don't know.
[111:38.69]I don't know.
[111:40.96]We got another couple people, right?
[111:42.60]He's out of his fucking mind.
[111:45.10]He wanted to hurt us.
[111:45.90]I mean, I think they're alright.
[111:51.45]I thought he was the one who attacked Jess.
[111:55.69]I heard Jessica.
[111:57.09]I don't know how or why she was down there.
[111:59.17]The only reason why people died was not because of my bad decisions.
[112:02.97]I made good decisions throughout the game.
[112:05.05]But like the knee jerk, don't move, like accidentally you moved and they died.
[112:09.59]I'm just a little worried because, you know, I'm his girlfriend.
[112:13.63]Did he tell you that?
[112:14.47]I mean, I probably wasn't his favorite person there for a couple minutes, but he knows how devoted I am to him.
[112:20.51]He knows.
[112:21.87]He said he knows, right?
[112:25.63]Your friend Ashley, she told her she tried to help you.
[112:31.66]She said she heard you calling out.
[112:33.08]Not me.
[112:39.90]Mike.
[112:41.02]What do you remember?
[112:43.96]No excuse.
[112:44.76]He came for me.
[112:47.12]He did.
[112:48.54]Came for you?
[112:49.79]Mad because bad?
[112:50.45]Where is he?
[112:50.83]No, I just... Did he make it?
[112:53.49]I fucked up.
[112:54.25]I moved when I wasn't supposed to move.
[112:56.13]Josh helped us.
[112:57.29]And then... Fuck, man.
[113:01.69]That thing.
[113:02.24]Okay?
[113:03.52]The Wendigo.
[113:05.70]It came out of the darkness and it just... Screwed us up.
[113:09.36]I don't know.
[113:11.38]I heard screaming.
[113:12.20]I got out of there.
[113:13.96]There's no point in both of us dying.
[113:15.52]What was in the trapdoor?
[113:16.72]Was there an actual one to go in there, or was there a dog?

[113:30.87]Hey, hey, hey, it's going to be okay.
[113:32.25]Written and performed by Stephanie Sid.
[113:36.60]Alright, well, now what is it?
[113:41.02]I can mimic human voices.
[113:43.84]See?
[113:44.14]Yeah, right.
[113:47.22]Alright, let's skip this.
[113:52.58]Are we gonna get like a stats page or something?
[113:55.92]Episodes.
[113:57.52]Oh, wait a minute.
[113:58.32]So hold on a minute.
[114:02.20]Select an episode to replay and change the story.
[114:03.86]Hold on.
[114:05.92]Where is it?
[114:10.75]Where's the, uh... Where's the... Where's the shoot the, um... It wasn't Karma.
[114:21.20]What's the one that where I... I want to shoot the gun.
[114:24.06]I want to shoot.
[114:29.63]It was eight.
[114:30.87]I want to do this.
[114:32.37]I want to see if it actually works.
[114:37.67]And you can take it off sub only.
[114:40.39]I wanna shoot that shotgun.
[114:43.41]I wanna show you guys the truth.
[114:45.97]Well, here we go.
[114:46.47]I'll give you my assessment of the game.
[114:49.38]It's good.
[114:49.86]It was fun.
[114:50.54]I enjoyed it.
[114:51.28]I enjoyed making choices.
[115:05.71]We're gonna fucking pay, you dick!
[115:07.87]What happened?
[115:08.77]Story was a little all over the place, but I'm sure if you play through more than a few times, you'll get the whole thing.
[115:13.62]Christ.
[115:15.56]Oh, God.
[115:17.76]Oh, my God, Matt!
[115:21.48]Stop the car crash.
[115:25.12]Alright, so now this time, I kind of want to do this.
[115:34.23]We're, like, at, like, episode eight.
[115:36.71]I'm gonna try to kill everyone.
[115:43.58]No!
[115:43.88]Don't do it!
[115:45.68]What happens if everyone dies?
[115:48.84]Get back!
[115:50.42]I'm gonna fail every quick time.
[115:56.65]No!
[115:57.37]No!
[115:58.79]Use these!
[116:00.09]My, like, dog is fucking barking at something.
[116:01.95]Give me a minute.
[116:02.33]I'll be right back.
[118:21.82]Alright, he was just being a weirdo.
[118:23.96]We're good.
[118:26.02]So, what do you guys think?
[118:26.64]You want me to just try to get as many?
[118:28.06]By the way, if you were just here just to watch through Until Dawn, thanks for watching.
[118:32.16]We're going to try some wacky shit now.
[118:36.20]Thank you for sticking around, though.
[118:39.59]Let's see what we can do.
[118:40.55]It's the best ending.
[118:43.07]Well, here's the thing.
[118:44.23]At this point of the story, everybody was still alive, right?
[118:53.20]Shit!
[118:53.72]This is where we left.
[118:58.80]This is where we started.
[119:00.04]Oh my god.
[119:01.84]Alright, let's go.
[119:05.93]Everybody would be alive if it wasn't... I just want to know if I shoot the gun.
[119:12.65]I mean, that's going to take like a minute.
[119:14.85]So everyone rewind your brains.
[119:17.55]Like, fucking two hours.
[119:20.97]What was I saying when I came back here?
[119:22.53]Alright.
[119:25.70]It's got my red ice cream cone with a little sparkler on it.
[119:28.56]I'm going to try to redo the whole stream.
[119:29.64]Okay?
[119:30.16]Wait a minute.
[119:32.82]Wait a minute.
[119:34.66]Everybody hang tight for a second.
[119:38.35]Everybody hold tight for one second.
[119:41.05]Everybody calm down.
[119:44.47]It's going to be worth it.
[119:45.17]Trust me.
[119:46.05]Just wait.
[119:48.07]Just wait.
[119:52.86]I'll be right back.
[119:53.31]This is going to be worth it.
[120:17.53]We're going to watch the video and play at the same time.
[120:20.30]You know what I'm going to do.
[120:21.20]Just give me a minute.
[120:54.88]That was good.
[121:15.42]Okay, let's give this a try.
[121:16.56]This is gonna be fucking hard to do, but hold on.
[121:36.10]Okay, let's go with, where is it?
[121:45.43]It's one of these.
[121:46.05]There's like fucking four of them.
[121:53.59]I think it's this one.
[122:01.98]Is that it?
[122:05.63]What's this?
[122:07.11]No, that's not it.
[122:08.07]That's not the right one.
[122:12.22]Hold on.
[122:12.66]How about... Oh, shit.
[122:14.38]Hold on.
[122:16.40]This will be worth it.
[122:18.26]Plus, we're done with the game already, so don't worry about it.
[122:20.76]We're good.
[122:23.78]Just gotta get the right window.
[122:30.46]That's not it.
[122:34.26]That's not it.
[122:35.80]Where is it?
[122:39.95]What the fuck?
[122:41.33]This is so important.
[122:42.61]I don't know if it's going to work.
[122:56.79]Oh, God damn it.
[122:59.55]I mean, there it is, but it won't pop up on the screen for some reason.
[123:06.04]It's not going to work.
[123:07.92]It's not going to work.
[123:11.48]You can see it on the screen, but it's not actually showing the video.
[123:16.11]That's unfortunate.
[123:16.97]Oh, well.
[123:18.69]Well, just pretend we did that.
[123:23.75]God damn it.
[123:26.83]I'm doing screen capture right now.
[123:31.02]It's not working.
[123:32.66]It probably has something to do with, like, I'm capping the screen that's, like, I don't know.
[123:36.93]Who knows?
[123:38.49]I'm going to close some windows.
[123:39.53]Let me close, like, a bunch of fucking windows, and then we'll try this again.
[123:43.55]I just closed the chat.
[123:45.83]I literally could have closed every single fucking window that it could be.
[123:50.76]It has to be this one.
[123:54.36]Let's go for it again.
[123:57.58]Re-up it.
[123:59.04]There it is.
[124:02.81]Okay.
[124:03.35]It's not showing up.
[124:05.20]But what if I do this?
[124:11.22]Does that not work?
[124:17.16]Almost.
[124:17.78]Hold on.
[124:24.31]Bear with me here.
[124:25.07]I'm going to try one more thing and then we're just going to move on.
[124:29.57]Why can't things just fucking do what I say?
[124:31.53]You know what I mean?
[124:33.52]clearly available so why does it not work I think I can do this no it's not gonna work oh fuck it we just wasted a bunch of time oh well not gonna happen
[124:55.63]It would have been funny if programs did what they were supposed to fucking do.
[124:59.43]You know what would be really great?
[125:01.17]If a program actually did what the fuck it says it's supposed to do.
[125:03.65]That would be fucking fantastic.
[125:07.59]Can't even make my shitty joke.
[125:14.50]Screen capture!
[125:16.14]No, it doesn't fucking work.
[125:19.08]Oh, okay.
[125:21.22]That was great.
[125:25.44]Like, fuck programs, you know what I mean?
[125:26.94]Like, fuck all, fuck coders.
[125:28.46]Get it right next time.
[125:34.73]Let's go.
[125:36.61]Fucking bullshit.
[125:41.45]Like, that would have been fun.
[125:43.53]But I cannot screen capture my own thing.
[125:47.22]It just doesn't do anything.
[125:48.60]It just goes to a black screen.
[125:49.86]Nice job, fucking coder.
[125:53.40]Fucking Bill Gates.
[126:02.69]This guy's raging on stream, but they're okay.
[126:05.83]I'm gonna give you guys like a real scenario Why streaming is annoying sometimes because like I'm on a PS4
[126:31.02]I'm going to play stage before.
[126:31.82]There's no second monitor.
[126:33.30]I am using the second monitor.
[126:34.46]Let's go right.
[126:39.03]What I was going to say is, when something's happening live, I can't sit here and try to fix it.
[126:50.21]If it doesn't work the first time, it's just not going to work.
[126:54.75]Why is it so loud?
[126:58.74]Like, if this shit doesn't work the first or second time, even though it should, I can't fucking spend, like, 30 minutes trying to figure it out.
[127:05.48]Because it's live.
[127:06.26]Like, we're fucking sitting here live.
[127:11.06]I would love to, like, just be able to fucking figure out why that didn't work for, like, 40 straight minutes.
[127:16.03]But I can't do that.
[127:23.36]Fucking move, then!
[127:27.34]So does that- none of that- just walk into the chain.
[127:29.76]Alright, I failed every se- oh, now- now I'm dead.
[127:37.56]Now I'm dead.
[127:39.62]You can only fail so many of them before you die.
[127:47.14]Well, there she goes.
[127:47.94]Fuck, I was going- I want to go in the meat grinder.
[127:50.41]Fuck.
[127:53.55]They don't matter.
[127:54.09]I just wanted to find out if I could shoot the gun.
[128:04.60]Oh, crap.
[128:05.86]Wait, this is so far ago.
[128:07.14]This is a long time ago.
[128:08.54]I'm trying something.
[128:21.41]Just keep watching this while I try this.
[128:27.76]Let's see if this works.
[128:34.12]Like, does this work?
[128:38.53]No, not like the fucking OBS project.
[128:40.49]Like this.
[128:45.81]Does it do it?
[128:47.60]Did it work?
[128:49.40]Oh, I think I got it.
[128:50.06]I think I got it.
[128:52.24]I got it!
[128:53.30]I got it, everybody, we're good.
[128:54.82]Oh shit, wait, what's a- the 5 hour energy app, hold on!
[129:01.12]We gotta get back to- I don't- who is this?
[129:03.02]I don't want to see, like, get this ad off the screen!
[129:07.02]Alright, we got it, we got it, we got it.
[129:14.78]Get off the screen for a second, I figured it out, we got it.
[129:17.84]You know what, you guys, you know what I fucking love?
[129:19.15]I love fucking coders, you know what I mean?
[129:22.48]I think I have to... It's just going to play it from the very beginning, though.
[129:27.30]Oh, god damn it.
[129:31.52]It's going to take like 30 minutes to get here.
[129:35.04]Shit.
[129:38.50]Do you ever watch his own ads?
[129:43.68]Ah, never mind.
[129:44.34]It's not going to work.
[129:45.41]I can't fast forward it.
[129:47.21]There's no fast forwarding this.
[129:49.81]It's just playing the link I posted.
[129:54.75]We're going to watch a stream.
[129:57.25]Alright.
[129:57.95]Right-click it.
[130:00.23]Would that actually do anything?
[130:04.79]No.
[130:05.63]It's... No, I can't.
[130:07.69]It's just going to play.
[130:13.64]It's just going to play it.
[130:14.66]I can't do it.
[130:20.64]The long setup.
[130:23.56]I have to like go back.
[130:26.24]I can't interact with the, alright, hold on, here's what we're gonna do.
[130:29.28]I need to like be able to hear this.
[130:31.58]Oh, no, I don't.
[130:32.28]What am I even saying right now?
[130:33.50]We're gonna play Tilda.
[130:34.34]I should have cleared my throat before I hit the.
[130:40.77]Play link with timestamp.
[130:43.77]Oh, that's a good, good, good, good, very good idea.
[130:45.27]Good idea, good idea, that's what we're gonna do.
[130:47.39]Alright, somebody get me the timestamp of the Twitch VOD.
[130:52.47]Because I can't do it right now.
[130:54.51]Alright, so that's what we're going to do.
[130:56.43]Give me the timestamp of the Twitch pod.
[130:57.91]Of like where I am right now.
[130:59.27]You know what I mean?
[131:03.81]Like where I'm sitting right now.
[131:05.78]Give me like the twitch.tv timestamp.
[131:10.90]3.42?
[131:11.52]Fucking no!
[131:12.26]Not 3.42!
[131:15.88]It's about to be a fucking lightning storm over here.
[131:21.40]If one of my mods want to just link that to me... Fucking 342.
[131:27.88]I actually was going to do it.
[131:31.66]Twitchception.
[131:33.36]This is viewer participation.
[131:39.90]You have mods?
[131:40.76]I do.
[131:41.52]Look, this is just like the after the stream bullshit.
[131:43.92]We already streamed Until Dawn.
[131:45.24]Now we're trying to do something fucking stupid.
[131:48.18]Okay, this is...
[131:50.37]That's not the one.
[131:52.96]And now I just fucking clicked off.
[131:58.16]I'm looking.
[131:58.62]Give me a sec.
[131:59.24]Try to get me like right here.
[132:01.20]You know what I mean?
[132:01.64]Like right where I am.
[132:03.48]Between demand and suggest.
[132:04.66]And I'm going to have to try to catch up.
[132:09.31]It's going to be me talking over me.
[132:12.97]I'm going to try.
[132:13.51]This is going to be worth it, guys.
[132:14.95]Trust me.
[132:16.79]Because I need to hear myself talk.
[132:18.43]I need to recreate the stream.
[132:21.54]This is the after stream.
[132:26.03]Wait, fuck.
[132:26.49]Why is it still going?
[132:27.59]Getting over a migraine.
[132:28.81]Got a jet set.
[132:30.41]But this should cover the cost of Advil in accordance to Boston sales.
[132:34.23]Fuck.
[132:36.74]Did somebody link it?
[132:39.58]Holy Mac is on it.
[132:40.38]What is going to sit here?
[132:42.74]I have to delete this.
[132:43.50]It's fucking freaking me out.
[132:44.50]Remove this.
[132:45.34]All I hear is myself talking.
[132:49.77]So 14 minutes.
[132:50.97]OK, let me try that.
[132:55.23]OK, Sam's got it.
[133:01.11]Alright, I think I think we're going to I think we're going to be ready to go here, guys.

[133:08.30]I think where I think we're in the correct spot.
[133:13.70]Here we go.
[133:14.82]I need to move this.
[133:17.82]We're going to do like this screen up here.
[133:23.42]There we go.
[133:24.30]Get this like stretched out.
[133:29.78]So here's the screen up here.
[133:32.06]And the other one's going to be right.
[133:33.36]I got to go right away, though.
[133:38.04]I'm going to get another fucking ad.
[133:40.32]OK, here we go.

[134:28.32]Here we go.
[134:29.02]Where am I?
[134:29.50]Demand.
[134:31.42]Okay.
[134:32.22]That I can use.
[134:33.46]I don't know where we are.
[134:36.31]Yeah, if you're just joining us for the first time, wait a minute, this is important.
[134:39.53]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[134:42.37]How far?
[134:42.97]Oh!

[134:50.25]Here we go.
[134:51.69]So we're gonna do... We're gonna play this fucking... We're gonna do this correctly.
[134:54.09]I can't... You can see... Which one of these... Which one of those is mine?
[134:57.70]Which is mine?
[134:59.42]He doesn't see that guy?
[135:01.34]Am I the top left one?
[135:02.48]I forget.
[135:02.82]You don't, like, fucking see them through the door.
[135:05.84]Okay, here we go.
[135:06.64]I fucked it up.
[135:07.18]Here we go.
[135:07.74]I remember I, like, touched it.
[135:09.34]Like, right now.
[135:10.57]Nope.
[135:11.21]It's, like, right now.
[135:13.13]And then I... Yeah, let me... Shit!
[135:15.54]I did it too quickly!
[135:21.46]Hold on.
[135:23.88]This is so confusing, guys.
[135:25.52]I can't do it.
[135:26.14]Are you serious?
[135:27.78]Oh, I should turn... Okay, wait, wait.
[135:30.52]I'm gonna turn one of them off.
[135:33.32]We just get audio for one.
[135:45.46]Paradox.
[135:48.10]I have to play this on my other monitor, you know, right?
[135:50.62]Like, I gotta stretch this out.
[135:51.62]Okay.
[135:52.08]It's on the top left one.
[135:53.10]Okay, guys, good luck finding out which one's actually being played.
[135:57.09]There you go.
[136:13.51]Uh-oh.
[136:14.75]Which one's actually getting played?
[136:16.39]He's talking about, like, the Native American... I'm only gonna tell you this one.
[136:19.73]Which one do you wanna hear?
[136:22.47]This one?
[136:22.77]It has to be... I have to mute this one.
[136:24.34]Can I beat my record?
[136:26.00]Do you think I can beat it first?
[136:46.71]Why am I doing this?
[136:48.30]Hannah ate Beth, got it.
[136:50.20]Yeah, Hannah ate Beth, got it.
[136:51.82]Wait, is he remembering that he ate somebody?
[136:55.82]Uh-oh.
[136:56.00]How do I... Why am I... I don't... There's no reason to do this.
[137:00.60]I thought he was like, oh shit, I shouldn't have eaten that person.
[137:03.47]Keep him home with me?
[137:04.05]Goddammit, what did I do?
[137:05.85]Guys, these are my splits.
[137:07.91]Mute the bottom right one, but that one has me in it.
[137:09.95]Do you want to hear me?
[137:16.97]There it is.
[137:19.29]Too many Germans.
[137:24.57]Which one needs to be on?
[137:28.51]Is that better?
[137:32.15]But now you won't hear me.
[137:36.87]Don't mute either of them.
[137:43.09]I'm top left.
[137:44.61]Old me is bottom right.
[137:48.79]Open up a third stream.
[137:50.09]This is going to be so hard to sync this up, guys.
[137:57.12]Do you understand?
[138:03.40]I'm trying to like, I can't recreate the whole thing.
[138:13.98]Although, finally, we're going to get to see the truth.
[138:19.16]We're gonna get to see the truth, guys.
[138:23.56]Split screen.
[138:30.55]Play three at the same time.
[138:34.95]I'm only doing this so I can... You're right.
[138:36.65]Alright, smash... Alright, grab his pen and smash it into the back of his gas tank.
[138:44.69]Grab the knife on table, stab it as hard as you can into propane tank.
[138:48.50]Why is that not a- Whoa!
[138:49.82]Shotgun!
[138:50.50]Add Jerma985 to your following directory?
[138:54.88]What the fuck is that?
[139:01.00]I'm gonna get this.
[139:02.35]Wait, did he- You follow Jerva.
[139:15.78]I'm not going to kill this guy.
[139:18.40]You don't kill the bad guy that knows everything about the mountain.
[139:20.88]He's going to die on his own in the cutscene.
[139:25.19]Don't worry.
[139:27.65]Good luck.
[139:28.29]Okay, here we go.
[139:30.93]Don't you guys have any idea?
[139:32.05]A fucking random mystical dude that knows everything will die in a cutscene before he says the secret.
[139:38.99]I gotta get this right.
[139:39.91]Hold on.
[139:46.42]I have to mute this for a sec.
[139:47.54]It's just too much.
[139:48.58]I'm hearing double.
[139:49.80]Wait, what if I do this?
[139:50.44]I get an idea.
[139:50.84]Okay, that's gross.
[139:51.56]Shit!
[139:51.66]I'm blowing it already.
[139:52.50]Go, go, go, go, go.
[139:53.12]I gotta get, I gotta fucking keep up, keep up, keep up.
[140:17.56]On the top.
[140:18.56]Alright, I gotta slow down, slow down, slow down.
[140:19.86]We're good.
[140:20.32]We can cross the bridge, cross the bridge.
[140:21.35]Come on.
[140:24.83]I need to relive this moment exactly like it happened on stream.
[140:27.71]Come on.
[140:31.86]Can't we just say, like, fuck this guy?
[140:33.44]Yeah, fuck this guy.
[140:34.24]Why are we going back to rescue a guy that caused us to so many problems?
[140:41.47]Sync the screens.
[140:42.09]I'm trying to.
[140:42.65]I'm going to try to.
[140:43.43]Here we go.
[140:43.81]Ready?
[140:44.89]Anything like that in there?
[140:45.87]Anything?
[140:49.99]Do I- I have to pause the game for like five seconds, right?
[140:52.05]Wait, what is this?
[140:55.53]I need to look at this.
[140:58.28]Alright, I gotta look at this.
[141:00.00]Hold on.
[141:01.90]Shit.
[141:03.42]No, fuck it.
[141:04.44]We're caught up now.
[141:05.04]We're caught up.
[141:06.96]No, go.
[141:08.38]This is an opportunity to catch up.
[141:10.58]Alright.
[141:10.94]We're in a perfect fucking place.
[141:21.10]And here we go.
[141:21.62]Ready?
[141:22.62]This is going to be perfect.
[141:27.07]I can't pause the VOD, by the way.
[141:30.05]The second I see him turn, I have to turn.
[141:32.36]I got to get the perfect sync.
[141:37.82]I got to be on the ball on this one.
[141:38.85]You're right.
[141:43.08]Shut up, Chris.
[141:43.68]Here we go.
[141:44.16]I got it.
[141:44.86]No, not you.
[141:45.52]Not like you that gave like the bits over there.
[141:47.68]I'm talking about this Chris.
[141:48.56]If your name is Chris, I'm sorry.
[141:49.74]That's not what I meant.
[141:50.34]Are we good?
[141:51.60]I got it.
[141:53.38]I got it.
[141:53.84]I got it.
[141:54.16]I got it.
[141:54.42]I got it.
[141:54.64]I got it.
[141:55.08]Oh, it's so close.
[141:56.00]Shit.
[141:56.22]God damn it.
[141:57.16]I had it so close.
[142:09.44]Why even come back for this guy?
[142:12.36]I'm off, but a little bit.
[142:16.92]I'm gonna have another chance, though.
[142:19.79]I'll have another chance.
[142:21.09]I gotta get it right when the cutscene happens.
[142:22.99]Pause the VOD for a second.
[142:23.95]I can't.
[142:24.43]I can't do it.
[142:30.63]I walked around a lot.
[142:31.55]I'm just gonna wait by the door and wait till he walks out the door, right?
[142:35.03]One piece at a time.
[142:40.12]The second I come out of the lodge is when I'm going to try to sink it.
[142:47.28]So here we go.
[142:47.98]I just have to sit right the fuck here.
[142:50.52]Here we go.
[142:51.08]There's me being like a fucking dumb shithead.
[142:55.66]Okay.
[142:56.02]I just got to wait till past me goes out the door.
[143:04.07]And then bang, I'm going to walk out.
[143:08.46]I'm gonna get it synced.
[143:09.52]Because I'm listening to me right now and talking like a fucking idiot.
[143:14.71]There's gonna be a secret in here.
[143:16.35]I'm gonna do me what I was doing before.
[143:18.27]At least I don't have to shock it.
[143:20.45]I'm okay.
[143:21.79]What's this?
[143:23.31]Oh, I don't know.
[143:24.05]Okay, here we go.
[143:32.27]Once I turn to go out that door, I have to move.
[143:36.07]Here we go.
[143:37.81]He just said, oh crap, a few times.
[143:39.97]I gotta go.
[143:40.57]I gotta go.
[143:40.93]Here we go.
[143:43.71]And outside we go.
[143:50.47]God damn it.
[143:51.83]What?
[143:52.67]I fucked it up twice.
[143:54.25]I fucked it up twice.
[143:55.29]Okay.
[143:55.95]Here we go.
[143:57.09]This is what you guys are going to know what happened.
[144:00.40]This is it.
[144:00.86]This is it.
[144:03.24]Oh, I just got him.
[144:10.53]I told you guys.
[144:11.95]Ah, shit.
[144:12.99]I gotta get this right.
[144:14.87]Oh my god.
[144:15.21]Still not synced.
[144:16.05]Oh my god, he got him.
[144:17.91]Oh my god, because I stepped on a fucking twig.
[144:20.65]Here we go!
[144:22.03]Wait, what?
[144:23.31]What is going on?
[144:23.72]I did it!
[144:24.88]I couldn't shoot the gun!
[144:26.02]Oh my god, no!
[144:30.34]See?
[144:31.50]I did that exact thing last time!
[144:33.12]Why wouldn't the gun shoot?
[144:34.02]I did that exact thing last time.
[144:35.17]Why wouldn't the gun shoot?
[144:36.61]Why didn't the gun shoot?
[144:37.73]See?
[144:38.75]Timeline changed.
[144:40.59]It's over.
[144:41.51]We're on two different timelines now.
[144:46.39]That gun wouldn't fire.
[144:48.37]The gun wouldn't fire.
[144:50.88]R2 didn't do anything.
[144:54.00]The gun wouldn't shoot.
[144:56.28]The gun wouldn't fire.
[144:58.42]I'm literally sitting there pressing R2 over and over again.
[145:02.38]We're in the same timeline.
[145:05.68]Okay.
[145:06.86]We're in the same timeline.
[145:12.61]I tried to shoot the fuel tank.
[145:14.39]I tried to shoot the fuel tank.
[145:16.97]We're back in the same timeline.
[145:18.88]Hold on a minute.
[145:21.47]You saw me.
[145:22.15]I tried to shoot the fuel tank.
[145:23.49]It didn't work.
[145:23.95]So I was like, okay, so I went over to the fucking Go, I mean I tried to shoot it out angry.
[145:28.61]I am you guys look at it You guys are all giving me shit right now and like I'm freaking out I didn't have any bullets.
[145:36.43]I swear to fucking god.
[145:37.45]I did that last time We're synced up we synced up perfectly right now you guys seeing this I
[145:49.33]We're in, like, almost a perfect sync.
[145:51.09]We're fine.
[145:52.21]Everything's fine.
[145:54.86]Motion control not.
[145:56.20]We're back to fucking normal.
[145:57.18]It's a perfect sync.
[145:58.08]Ash, what's wrong?
[146:01.18]It's... Alright, we're good.
[146:04.70]Mike, where's Chris?
[146:05.92]You guys didn't think we were gonna be in a perfect fucking sync.
[146:09.26]It was meant to be.
[146:09.96]He didn't... He was out there.
[146:14.44]I'm still complaining about the shooting.
[146:16.98]Listen to me.
[146:19.32]He legit did not know how to use the shotgun.
[146:27.76]No, no, rewind.
[146:28.74]What happened here?
[146:29.85]Something went wrong there.
[146:32.85]I killed Emily.
[146:33.67]Oh, shit.
[146:38.29]She's just not here.
[146:40.75]Emily's just not here.
[146:46.95]It's so funny.
[146:50.32]Emily's just not standing in the corner.
[146:53.60]You guys, this is a lot harder than you might think.
[147:02.68]Wait, it's... So wait, Ashley, I can't shoot Ashley.
[147:08.46]Oh no, I fucked up the whole timeline.
[147:10.36]What is that?
[147:11.68]I was down there.
[147:15.60]Alright, I gotta go back and I gotta do four.
[147:18.32]No, I can't.
[147:19.02]That's too much.
[147:21.08]That's too fucking much, man.
[147:22.32]Imagine if I can't do four screens.
[147:25.26]I can't.
[147:31.42]I can't.
[147:31.99]I'm not gonna be able to do that shit.
[147:35.33]Do three?
[147:36.29]Oh, goddammit.
[147:39.39]No, it's not gonna work.
[147:40.37]It's not gonna work.
[147:43.48]It's not gonna work.
[147:45.20]I can't capture two of the same bot at the same time.
[147:47.35]I can't do it.
[147:51.13]Four screens.
[147:52.27]No muting.
[147:54.07]Alright, so what's left?
[148:01.50]Now I play as Sam?
[148:09.14]Capture this bot and it'll have two paths.
[148:12.87]I've already broken time.
[148:14.53]Just use different browsers.
[148:19.75]Four screens and no muting.
[148:21.37]That's how we're going to have to end the stream, okay?
[148:24.19]Like, I'm going to do this for another minute or two.
[148:26.03]And then I'm going to do that.
[148:27.03]We're going to end the stream that way.
[148:28.19]Because that's going to be too much.
[148:31.16]Okay, I'm Ashley.
[148:33.22]This is where I go through the pages, right?
[148:40.84]The last page...
[148:42.42]And then it'll be synced.
[148:44.58]This is where they freak out about her getting bit.
[148:50.62]Just capture this VOD from where you started capturing this VOD.
[148:55.61]Oh, God damn it.
[148:56.23]I... Well, I can inform, right?
[149:05.45]Do no screens.
[149:06.37]It's funny how much more dialog is here.
[149:14.52]I can just sit here and once I get to inform or not inform.
[149:21.77]So, yeah, like I back it up and it's either inform or not inform.
[149:29.33]This whole thing plays out.
[149:33.00]Well, maybe not.
[149:33.68]No.
[149:34.08]Okay.
[149:34.38]Hold on.
[149:38.84]You won't even.
[149:39.60]Three VODs and three face cams.
[149:41.92]If I had a facecam on, there would be three face cams.
[149:47.39]Wait, what is running now?
[149:50.31]Oh, I think we're about to lose the timeline here.
[149:56.34]No, okay, we're back here.
[150:00.26]I'm genuinely annoyed because I have no fucking idea what he's trying to do.
[150:06.09]So listen here, here's what's going on So I played through Until Dawn I was done with it and I wanted to prove to everybody that like I did the right thing So we went back to the very we went back to the beginning of the game and I'm playing through again to show everybody how correct I was It's gonna be so far away I
[150:33.92]If I have her over there, watch this.
[150:35.20]See?
[150:35.70]That's what I did last time.
[150:39.61]Timeline's already lost.
[150:41.87]Alright, hold on.
[150:48.81]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[150:51.17]Just pause.
[150:52.05]I can't pause it.
[150:53.14]I missed too many things.
[150:54.58]Alright, so...
[151:03.92]What?
[151:04.38]2-0-9-30?
[151:05.02]2-0-9-30.
[151:07.76]You know what I'm talking about.
[151:12.80]You can just skip.
[151:13.42]2-0-9-30.
[151:13.66]Okay.
[151:13.82]Wait, wait, wait.
[151:14.38]This is good, this is good.
[151:15.42]I can sync this up here.
[151:19.71]We just have to wait.
[151:29.53]I can, like, sync the timeline again.
[151:31.53]She shows a sign of turning.
[151:34.13]So I'm just gonna sit here and contemplate if they hurt me or not.
[151:42.90]It's the butterfly effect.
[151:49.70]Come on, save Chris.
[151:52.32]Alright, fine.
[151:53.00]I'm gonna go save Chris.
[151:55.43]Alright.
[151:58.22]Let's go.
[151:59.60]You guys want to see that shit?
[152:02.37]You guys want to see that so bad, huh?
[152:07.89]Let's see it then.
[152:16.91]Okay.
[152:17.37]Okay.
[152:17.91]Oh, god damn it.
[152:28.57]It's like a World of Warcraft ad.
[152:31.83]What was the other one?
[152:32.67]Don't give me another fucking ad.
[152:39.42]Oh, shit.
[152:39.74]Hold on.
[152:40.14]Hold on.
[152:40.46]Remove, remove, remove.
[152:56.12]And I can't pause it.
[152:57.68]I can't fucking pause this shit.
[153:02.27]Pause.
[153:07.43]Okay, I think I can just like redo it.
[153:12.11]Alright, somebody give me where I was before.
[153:14.09]Because I need to get to the right spot.
[153:23.36]It's over.
[153:23.94]It's over.
[153:24.74]It's it.
[153:25.12]It's over.
[153:25.64]It's not gonna work.
[153:26.97]It's too much.
[153:27.59]Goodbye.
[153:28.91]It's over.
[153:33.43]It's over.
[153:33.93]It's not gonna work.
[153:40.22]I don't think it's gonna fucking... It's not gonna work.
[153:44.14]It's too much setup for a live stream.
[153:46.94]I would have to set this up like for fucking 30 minutes before the stream starts.
[153:53.81]Let's see.
[153:55.41]It can't be over.
[153:59.03]Alright, well, let's see what happens with this one.
[154:04.19]I don't know what's going to happen on this one.
[154:14.44]Wait, hold... No, it's not going to work.
[154:19.23]Just fuck the double screen.
[154:20.55]It's over.
[154:23.00]For me to be able to actively do that, you guys, it's gonna take me a fucking while to set that up.
[154:27.50]That's not something I can just do on the fly.
[154:31.56]Let's fit this back to the screen.
[154:35.28]I'm viewbotting.
[154:40.29]We can wait.
[154:40.97]No, it's too long.
[154:42.63]It's too much.
[154:44.83]That's something that I will set up before.
[154:48.34]Before I do a stream, I would, like, set that up.
[154:51.28]Because that's going to... Like, syncing three or four different fucking timelines?
[154:57.17]That's going to be fucking impossible.
[155:02.37]What I would need to do is I would need to... Where I started doing the split screen.
[155:10.15]If somebody can get me the exact moment where, like, the split screen, like, started working.
[155:14.89]Because I still have to get down here.
[155:16.17]And Emily has to live.
[155:20.51]And then that's gonna be the end of the stream, by the way.
[155:22.57]Like, after I do that, it's over.
[155:24.55]Where should I send it?
[155:37.00]Just send it right to me.
[155:38.18]Like, right here.
[155:39.82]Oh, fuck.
[155:40.38]Okay, I gotta, like... I gotta get to the point where I can, like, sync them up.
[155:50.89]He has all his shit to do.
[155:52.45]Save them all.
[155:55.23]Okay, well, there's apparently... Okay, I can't, like, make a decision right now.
[156:04.43]I'm trying to, like, copy and fucking paste, like, shit from the chat.
[156:07.49]Like, this is so difficult.
[156:09.13]Alright, here we go.
[156:09.81]I got it.
[156:17.19]I don't know where this... Okay, hey, Mac.
[156:18.95]Where does that start?
[156:19.69]What's the exact moment where that starts?
[156:26.14]Like, what's the exact second that that starts?
[156:28.20]Like, what are we doing?
[156:28.98]Like, where are we?
[156:29.52]So I can know when to, like, start it.
[156:37.51]Let her become Patty first.
[156:46.04]That doesn't matter.
[156:47.48]Let's go.
[156:55.18]42 exact seconds.
[156:59.19]What in the world am I doing?
[157:00.23]It's called... The stream was over, like, 30 minutes ago, and we're just doing this to make, like, dumb jokes.
[157:06.07]Alright, we're gonna meet Grindr here.
[157:10.39]And then... Here's the end of your stream, guys.
[157:13.51]Because I'm not going to be able to do anything after this.
[157:20.04]Stay on it.
[157:23.30]Fucking grind her up.
[157:27.78]Alright, so she missed it.
[157:29.38]And there's the last opportunity.
[157:30.74]Oh no!
[157:36.50]Okay, okay, okay.
[157:38.80]So, what?
[157:39.65]Jesus!
[157:42.77]so where are we here is at what point does this happen not worth it now we're gonna get the good ending okay so I'm gonna pause this for a second because so mac what what is currently happening in the link that you just gave me
[158:05.31]Like, it needs to start, wherever it needs to start, needs to start right when, like, I make that, like, decision when I first, like, turned on the double, you know what I mean?
[158:17.99]Why the fuck are we doing this?
[158:19.21]This is, like, 2-13-42 is, like, the exact moment when, like, I'm sitting there and I make, like, the decision with Chris.
[158:29.98]Let me see.
[158:39.67]There's no good ending.
[158:40.53]Well, the stream is already over.
[158:41.81]We're just doing this for fun now.
[158:45.30]We don't have to.
[158:46.24]Well, this is the worst joke of all time.
[158:48.44]Well, there's nothing else to do.
[158:52.26]I promise you, it's like ripping teeth out of my head to get this to work, but I have to do it.
[158:58.64]I need, like, the link.
[159:02.34]342 again.
[159:02.62]Because, like, I don't have, like, my Twitch open.
[159:06.84]Like, I have...
[159:10.37]Yeah, I give up.
[159:11.17]I give up.
[159:11.61]I can't fucking just sit here and waste time like this.
[159:16.14]This just takes way too much time to set up.
[159:19.86]So, sorry.
[159:20.60]That's it.
[159:21.02]It's over.
[159:23.76]It's just not gonna happen.
[159:25.36]It's just too much time.
[159:26.88]It takes way too much for me to have to get this to work.
[159:31.61]I'm going to give this one try.
[159:35.07]I'm gonna try this once.
[159:36.53]I don't even know where this is.
[159:38.79]But we're gonna give it a try.
[159:42.87]This is the bad ending.
[159:44.13]Just pretend the stream ended 20 minutes ago.
[159:45.99]That's what I'm saying.
[159:48.13]Where is this?
[159:49.91]I need to know where this actually is.
[159:51.29]Give me a second.
[159:58.99]Okay, what happens here?
[160:00.21]Alright, two.
[160:04.40]Here it is.
[160:06.64]We're going to try this one time.
[160:15.87]Now I want to see where it starts.
[160:18.82]No, ain't gonna work.
[160:20.52]Alright, that's it.
[160:21.16]It's not gonna work.
[160:25.96]This is where we were before.
[160:26.98]Yeah, that shit requires like 30 fucking minutes.
[160:35.58]And I'm not gonna like put you guys through like sit on a live broadcast while I set up a fucking 25 minute joke.
[160:45.70]I would love to do that, but I can't.
[160:52.27]It worked before.
[160:53.03]It's just, I can't get it to, it's going to take like, to sync like the two streams and this one again, it took like 25 minutes to do before and already after 20 minutes, it's not going to work.
[161:02.63]I have to set that up beforehand if I want to do it.
[161:05.47]It's not going to be worth it.
[161:07.67]Like this is where I was, but like none, I can't get like, I can't get like the right setting.
[161:15.90]Let's just fucking save Chris.
[161:22.52]I am not streaming tomorrow, but I will tell you what I'm doing.
[161:27.92]Hold on.
[161:28.28]I need to be able to hear this.
[161:31.06]Save Chris, save the stream.
[161:32.10]Thursday, I can't do it on Thursday.
[161:46.98]I have the gun.
[161:47.50]Does that change anything?
[161:50.04]No, it doesn't.
[161:50.98]No volume?
[161:51.80]We've already done it.
[161:52.84]I know, but I'm just not ready for it.
[161:57.91]I promise I will do that.
[161:58.69]I just can't do it on Thursday.
[162:17.55]Plus, I've been sitting there for so long trying to get the right time.
[162:21.01]I don't want to waste anybody's time.
[162:22.85]I'm done wasting your guys' time on me.
[162:24.33]Let's just save Chris, and then I'll tell you what's going on.
[162:27.20]Oh, God, I just realized I have to watch this fucking whole cutscene again.
[162:30.14]Okay.
[162:43.35]Anyway, so Thursday, what's gonna happen is, me and Etalyx are going to play... We're gonna do something called the Stream Challenge.
[162:51.76]Okay?
[162:51.92]Stream Challenge is... What a dumb name, by the way.
[162:55.44]We have to beat an entire game on stream, and it's the... The game in question, it's a co-op game, is... Kane and Lynch 2 Dog Days.
[163:06.46]We have to beat the whole game on stream on Thursday.
[163:08.70]From start to finish.
[163:09.59]That's the challenge.
[163:13.01]I mean, the game is apparently not that long, but we have to beat it.
[163:19.61]So, there's your content for Thursday.
[163:24.33]No matter what happens.
[163:26.59]No matter what.
[163:29.23]We have to complete that game from start to finish on Thursday.
[163:34.00]No matter what.
[163:37.62]So, it might be very painful at some point, but we have to push through it.
[163:45.50]Yeah, I turned it down just so I could talk about that shit.
[163:57.70]Where did you leave him?
[163:59.16]Where did you leave him?
[164:00.38]I love how we're doing this again.
[164:02.76]So many people were just like, I'm fucking out of here.
[164:04.42]I have a critical opinion of the game.
[164:07.38]It's going to be at least three hours.
[164:09.20]Yeah, well, we have to beat it.
[164:10.38]This is going to be the end of this stream, by the way.
[164:13.14]I wasn't really feeling that well.
[164:26.72]I hit him in the head.
[164:27.76]Chris, maybe he deserved it.
[164:29.34]Really, like, just not 100% today.
[164:32.61]And after, like, this three hours, my brain is already, like, fried.
[164:35.73]So, unfortunately, we're only going to have a three-hour stream today.
[164:40.43]The rest of you, get down to the basement and be safe.
[164:44.48]Don't go outside again until we're back.
[164:47.39]Thursday's stream is going to be at 7 o'clock.
[164:49.51]It might be at like 6.
[164:50.67]Depends on when Etalyx wants to play.
[164:51.99]I'm sorry I didn't do the three timelines thing.
[164:53.95]My brain is like scrambled eggs right now and I can't even do it.
[165:14.35]Kane and Lynch 2 Dog Days.
[165:16.13]Beat the game on stream challenge.
[165:17.43]Alright, this time I have to save both these guys and then I'm allowed to end the stream.
[165:24.49]It would have worked fine.
[165:26.76]Here's the reason why it bums me out that I can't do the three.
[165:34.20]Because it would have worked fine...
[165:43.63]if I could just, like, capture my window.
[165:47.27]It just won't work.
[165:47.77]It's a black screen.
[165:48.93]So I had to, like, do browser source, and, like, I can't pause or play.
[165:52.27]It's... It makes it, like, nearly impossible to try to sync it up.
[165:55.84]If I was able to do it the way I wanted to, it'd be fucking ten times easier.
[166:01.36]But I can't do it that way, apparently, for some reason.
[166:03.58]Alright.
[166:06.04]Save Chris, save Flamethrower guy, and then stream ends.
[166:10.05]How many times do I have to shoot it with the shotgun before it's dead?
[166:13.85]Well, you've been shooting it a long time.
[166:16.61]You mean this thing won't even kill it?
[166:19.33]I've just seen that kiss three times.
[166:20.87]Well, how do you kill it?
[166:22.21]They don't like fire.
[166:24.03]I don't like fire.
[166:25.27]Try XSplit.
[166:26.67]I refuse to use XSplit because they got their databases hacked and leaked out everybody's information a few years ago.
[166:32.32]No.
[166:35.14]Any service that saves your stream key on a fucking cloud is a service I don't want to use.
[166:40.20]So, fuck XSplit.
[166:42.08]What are these things like?
[166:44.16]No way.
[166:44.42]You can't say flamethrower guy.
[166:45.42]No.
[166:45.58]Paranoid streamer.
[166:46.22]No, I got my like information leaked.
[167:11.29]I don't know if it was me, like, personally, but, like, they got all their databases leaked, like, fucking four years ago.
[167:15.88]It was horrible.
[167:16.60]Alright, so I gotta save Chris, and then the stream can end.
[167:20.50]I just have to not move.
[167:23.76]Yeah.
[167:23.92]Well, I wouldn't recommend testing it out.
[167:26.14]Unless you have
[167:41.33]Here we go.
[167:46.62]Yeah, I know that, like, every service has had, like, a data leak and whatever.
[167:50.46]But, they, uh, uh, XSplit saves your stream key in the cloud.
[167:55.60]And what happened was, if somebody gets, like, a hold of your, like, account and, like, password and name and everything, they have your stream key.
[168:02.09]Like, I don't fucking want that to happen.
[168:05.05]Fuck that.
[168:07.24]He'll render you immobile.
[168:09.97]And then he strips the skin off of your entire body piece by piece.
[168:16.25]And then he keeps you alive and aware and feasts on your organs one piece at a time.
[168:25.30]Let's go.
[168:26.30]So the launch then?
[168:27.94]Yeah, let's go now.
[168:30.97]It might still be near.
[168:49.50]Hold on.
[168:54.86]Hold on.
[168:56.06]Everybody calm down for a second.
[169:25.69]Shit.
[169:25.91]Down to five.
[169:56.37]Just wait for the fucking stupid ad to stop playing.
[170:00.66]No, I don't care about five-hour energy.
[170:04.64]I don't care.
[170:05.82]Stop drinking it.
[170:07.27]Go.
[170:16.87]We got it, boys.
[170:18.42]We got it.
[170:23.61]We got it.
[170:26.74]Okay.
[170:27.98]Here we go.
[170:29.92]This is where we go.
[170:32.78]Alright, gotta get this right.
[170:33.96]Don't fuck this up.
[170:36.62]God damn it.
[170:37.64]Oh shit.
[170:38.08]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[170:39.40]Do it.
[170:41.34]Oh my fucking god.
[170:42.68]No, I didn't sync it up correctly.
[170:45.42]Shit.
[170:49.09]Oh, what the fuck?
[170:52.47]Here we go, here we go, here we go, I gotta get it right.
[170:56.35]I gotta get this right.
[171:01.15]Here we go, I gotta get it right.
[171:02.79]I gotta get it correct.
[171:06.29]I'm gonna shoot, I'm gonna shoot the guy.
[171:07.91]The guy always dies, shoot him!
[171:11.75]Good, we got it.
[171:13.19]Go, go.
[171:14.67]Go!
[171:16.64]I'm gonna get it right this time, I'm gonna get it right.
[171:22.63]Got it.
[171:23.87]We're safe.
[171:25.13]We are fucking safe.
[171:29.05]Got it.
[171:32.96]I did it.
[171:34.54]Chris is safe.
[171:35.88]Chris is safe.
[171:37.38]So far, so good.
[171:39.56]Oh, God damn it.
[171:40.56]Hold on.
[171:41.66]I'm good.
[171:52.34]Just gotta get to the fucking door.
[171:56.18]Open the door!
[171:57.54]Yes!
[172:01.08]Oh my god, what happened?
[172:02.48]I made it.
[172:04.21]I made it.
[172:04.73]Go, go, go, go, go, go!
[172:10.21]He's still alive.
[172:11.13]Alright guys, there you go.
[172:17.80]Timeline saved.
[172:21.35]We got the right timeline, no.
[172:22.75]No, I have to make him live through more death scenarios.
[172:29.01]Okay, we got... Is Emily still alive in this timeline?
[172:46.98]Fuck, Emily's dead in this song.
[172:49.04]Alright, now that's it.
[172:50.26]We did it.
[172:50.82]Thank you for watching.
[172:51.90]Thank you for watching.
[172:53.28]Alright, we're good.
[173:12.70]I don't know what I'm saying in the other stream.
[173:14.18]What's wrong?
[173:14.54]Save the man.
[173:14.94]So what happens to Chris now?
[173:15.98]Now I need to know.
[173:29.25]Each timeline gets retroactively worse in quality.
[173:32.01]Because we're compressing it like three times.
[173:33.95]Who is talking?
[173:35.07]Did somebody just give me bits?
[173:36.37]Or is that from one of the other timelines?
[173:38.37]I don't know.
[173:38.91]I think somebody just gave me bits.
[173:40.41]That could have been part of the other game.
[173:41.71]Do a perfect run.
[173:59.11]That's how I got back here.
[174:02.84]Alright, so where's Chris?
[174:05.26]You guys know what to do.
[174:07.84]Yeah.
[174:09.68]No one leave.
[174:10.38]No one leave.
[174:10.94]Okay?
[174:12.50]It's not safe out there.
[174:13.72]I'll be back soon.
[174:15.65]Well, now we've replaced Emily with Mike.
[174:17.45]I mean, with Chris.
[174:21.17]At this point, we're never gonna get to Dawn.
[174:23.79]Hey, what happened out there?
[174:24.71]They're gonna think I got, like, bit.
[174:25.87]Hey, are you okay?
[174:29.66]He was right there.
[174:30.32]What, the flamethrower dude?
[174:31.58]Yeah, the weird guy.
[174:34.16]He got himself killed.
[174:35.58]It's like there's three separate moons.
[174:38.48]I was definitely not lying about that.
[174:41.04]Oh, Jesus.
[174:42.80]What did it look like?
[174:44.08]Alright, so what's left?
[174:45.78]Like a person, only, but just distorted.
[174:49.56]Ashley Old Hotel.
[174:50.76]I know.
[174:51.78]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[174:52.98]Is there anything?
[174:53.82]Anything happen here?
[174:58.72]Resurrect Emily?
[174:59.94]I don't think I can.
[175:03.06]I will say, if Emily's still alive, that's the longest one.
[175:09.58]Why am I subscribed to a Bud Lightstreamer?
[175:15.51]Who the fuck are you talking about?
[175:22.37]Okay, we're like at the right point.
[175:23.81]Here we go.
[175:24.83]Crop your shit.
[175:25.57]Dude, it's much harder than you think.
[175:28.98]This is where they freak out about her getting bit.
[175:32.94]This is as good as it's gonna get.
[175:36.79]Just capture this bod from where you started.
[175:41.35]Here.
[175:41.65]On the left of my icon.
[175:43.43]Those aren't my subscriptions.
[175:45.89]I can inform.
[175:46.71]I don't know which is worse, actively triggering events.
[175:51.17]Who the fuck am I subscribed to?
[175:53.05]Does it matter how much more dialog is here?
[175:57.35]Because you couldn't lift a goddamn finger.
[176:00.70]I can just sit here and once I get to inform or not inform.
[176:06.43]Bud Light Sub.
[176:07.95]I don't have any idea, dude.
[176:09.19]Are you left your poor sisters to die?
[176:12.36]You did nothing to help me.
[176:14.76]Paralyzed by your own self-centered fear.
[176:18.18]No, I have no fucking idea.
[176:20.42]Now it's all about you, Josh.
[176:24.42]I'm subscribed to, like, Etalyx and, like, Star.
[176:28.07]If I had a facecam on me, there would be three facecams.
[176:31.97]Okay, we're back here.
[176:33.19]When are we gonna get to control the fucking game?
[176:52.08]Oh fuck, I paused it.
[176:52.98]I think Otto came in the bottom right.
[176:55.44]Alright, wait, I'm done.
[176:56.28]The shit like that, we're just like hanging out now.
[176:58.65]What do they do, do they hurt me?
[177:19.81]It's time for movies.
[177:23.41]Put the face here.
[177:24.54]No, that's it.
[177:25.78]Timeline's already locked.
[177:30.44]I'm satisfied.
[177:31.28]I'm satisfied too.
[177:32.44]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[177:37.07]In before the fourth screen?
[177:38.51]No, no fucking fourth screen.
[177:40.93]I'm like going to get a snack.
[177:41.91]I missed too many things and...
[177:46.84]Too many dermas, it hurts.
[177:48.06]Oh, it's still playing.
[177:49.16]It's still playing.
[177:49.98]I'm sorry.
[177:51.00]I didn't realize it was still fucking playing.
[177:54.98]Alright, that's it.
[177:57.26]We've been doing this for like 45 fucking minutes.
[178:02.28]Shout out to Bud Light, apparently.
[178:05.32]Let me get a very special shout out to Bud Light.
[178:13.02]Yeah, guys, those are recommended channels.
[178:18.26]I'm looking at it right now.
[178:19.22]Recommended channels.
[178:20.24]Bud Light.
[178:22.60]Some like Diablo II streamer.
[178:28.30]I don't know.
[178:30.55]Don't ask me.
[178:38.47]Liar.
[178:38.89]I'm not lying.
[178:39.65]Look.
[178:41.27]It says recommended.
[178:42.88]I'm looking at it right now.
[178:45.94]Stream that stream?
[178:47.24]Stream the Bud Light stream?
[178:49.46]Why?
[178:49.70]I don't know.
[178:50.41]I'm being recommended Bud Light streams.
[178:51.87]It's probably like a sponsored fucking... It's a Street Fighter V tournament.
[178:55.71]Sponsored by the piss water Bud Light.
[178:59.31]I shouldn't have said that.
[179:03.41]Alright.
[179:03.67]Well, anyways.
[179:05.88]Thank you for watching.
[179:10.22]Really appreciate it.
[179:11.60]We are going to can this here.
[179:14.89]Let's not be right back.
[179:15.75]It is outro time.
[179:19.33]Anyways, thank you for sticking around, those of you that wanted to see that.
[179:23.96]Hopefully it was entertaining enough.
[179:25.88]Completed Until Dawn.
[179:26.82]It was a good game.
[179:27.88]Recommended.
[179:28.36]It's, at this point, it's like two or three years old.
[179:30.39]It's only like 20 bucks or like 15 bucks or something.
[179:35.41]It's fun.
[179:37.33]So, uh, have a good rest of your night, guys.
[179:39.51]That concludes this stream.
[179:41.47]I would, like, do some other things, but three hours with a migraine is not necessarily the thing that I wanted to do.
[179:49.46]Like, with my brain, three hours awake with a migraine, I'd like to be in bed.
[179:54.19]So, um...
[179:57.61]Take care.
[179:58.97]Thursday is going to be Kane and Lynch 2 Dog Days.
[180:01.27]We have to beat the entire game on stream.
[180:04.05]It's going to be in Etalyx.
[180:05.73]Should be interesting.
[180:07.63]But I do want to read the bits before I go.
[180:09.99]Let me get those open.
[180:14.10]Because there are some bits to say hello to.
[180:19.00]Some people to say hello to.
[180:22.32]There it is.
[180:25.37]Thank you for bearing with me.
[180:26.85]I'm glad we at least got to save Chris in the triple timeline.
[180:32.27]But, thank you to Hussain for the $3.
[180:37.86]Thank you for the joke, my dude.
[180:39.26]You're very much welcome.
[180:41.66]Mr. Tubbs, thank you for the $10.
[180:42.62]Hey, Jerma, love the stream.
[180:43.86]When are you doing Yakuza 0?
[180:44.92]It's my favorite brawler series.
[180:47.46]I mean, I could still do it.
[180:49.97]I probably, I don't know.
[180:53.51]Thank you for the $10, Percival.
[180:56.15]I just, I don't know.
[180:57.91]It's like Hollow Knight for me.
[180:58.99]Like, it's something I want to do, but there's a lot of other things that, like, I have planned over the next, like, four or five streams.
[181:05.46]It might get in there somewhere.
[181:07.28]I don't know.
[181:07.60]I want to do some more PSVR, like, maybe one of those days.
[181:10.64]I just don't know.
[181:12.56]But if you're waiting around for Yakuza, I'm sorry that you're waiting.
[181:15.95]Somebody gave $4.
[181:17.01]I can't see their name for some reason.
[181:18.47]It just says, Save Our Boy.
[181:21.24]Premium Pillow was the one that gave almost $10, $9.49.
[181:25.28]You can't escape the Dead Chris timeline.
[181:27.29]Yeah, it was hard.
[181:29.49]Magpie Cuck.
[181:31.65]Oh, well, that's... Okay.
[181:32.69]Well, thanks for the $10.
[181:34.05]No, thanks for the $1.
[181:36.19]Thanks for the $1.
[181:37.98]Gummy Monk, thanks for the $5.
[181:39.28]They just scream as loud as they can.
[181:42.96]Stix Renegade gave me $5.
[181:43.94]It says, Jerma, you're a dum-dum.
[181:46.02]I know, I am.
[181:48.35]There's a lot of bits that I missed, damn.
[181:50.56]Uh, Vicarious Wrath, thanks for the dollar.
[181:52.88]Corvid Moon, thanks for the two bucks.
[181:54.18]Two dollars, one for each Jerma.
[181:55.86]Thank you.
[181:56.86]Well, now there were three Jermas there.
[181:59.76]And, um, Husan again gave two dollars.
[182:03.63]Wow, same amount of bits for two streams at once.
[182:05.77]Getting really, really getting my money's worth tonight.
[182:10.09]And right before the stream ends...
[182:13.40]Eefs gave $10, just says cheer.
[182:16.54]Cheer a thousand.
[182:17.10]Thank you, Eefs, or Eps, for the $10.
[182:21.06]And that's going to rack it up.
[182:23.15]That's going to rack it up.
[182:25.17]See you guys on Thursday for the stream challenge, complete the whole game.
[182:29.11]Take care, everybody.
[182:30.71]Good night.
[182:54.05]you
