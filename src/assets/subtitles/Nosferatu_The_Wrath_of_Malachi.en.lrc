[00:59.68]Important.
[01:00.04]We should probably turn the volume up a little.
[01:01.66]Like that.
[01:04.32]Better?
[01:04.91]That's a little better.
[01:05.63]Alright.
[01:06.03]New game.
[01:07.69]Medium.
[01:10.37]Oh god.
[01:10.95]Constructing a random castle.
[01:16.82]I just loaded a Minecraft seed.
[01:26.71]Can you mess with the antenna on the top of the roof, George?
[01:36.59]Randomly generated.
[01:38.05]First person.
[01:39.67]RPG simulation.
[01:41.60]Skill point simulation.
[01:46.94]On a misty October night in the Transylvanian mountains, we are ready to join your family and some of their closest friends at Castle Malachi.
[01:56.88]Come to Castle Malachi.
[02:02.56]Where all we play is regular show.
[02:05.16]That show that people thought was cool years ago.
[02:07.20]Arriving a day later than your family, you're thrilled about the reunion and the festivities that will follow.
[02:13.91]This is gonna be a real whodunit.
[02:15.65]As the coach taking you from the train station hurries through the fog towards the dark and ominous looking castle, you get a horrible feeling that everything is not what it is supposed to be.
[02:31.84]Can one of the mods change the title to Nosferatu?
[02:37.46]Attack of the Clones?
[02:42.77]I've always wanted to go to Transylvania.
[02:46.14]As the coach drops you off at the castle gates, you're left alone in the dark.
[02:51.06]It's a fucking lie.
[02:52.02]I just lied out loud.
[02:54.06]Just straight up lie.
[02:56.52]An icy wind sends a horrifying chill through your bones as you manage to push the massive gates open.
[03:04.69]Walking through the vault towards the empty castle plaza, you prepare yourself for the worst.
[03:12.15]God help us all.
[03:13.93]No!
[03:17.95]I'm ready.
[03:20.63]I'm pale enough to be a vampire?
[03:24.31]You enter an old stone-laid courtyard fronting a huge ancient castle.
[03:29.92]You must rescue your family.
[03:31.08]I missed it because I can't read.
[03:34.16]Press tab.
[03:36.62]Who the fuck is this?
[03:37.52]Who the fuck are these people?
[03:43.63]Hold on.
[03:44.07]What?
[03:44.87]What's in the suitcase?
[03:50.91]You found your cane sword!
[03:54.33]Aha!
[03:57.45]My trusty cane sword!
[04:00.21]Main car- Alright, what is this cartoon sign?
[04:05.03]Okay, let's do the- Okay, where am I going?
[04:07.67]Go over here.
[04:07.99]Alright, we're gonna go this way.
[04:17.68]What the fuck was that?
[04:22.84]Alright, here we go.
[04:23.84]There's a horn.
[04:24.34]You found gunpowder and bullets.
[04:26.82]You found ammunition for a machine gun.
[04:30.06]Alright, there's a free treasure chest.
[04:34.58]That's, uh, that's death.
[04:35.46]I have to find my family.
[04:43.07]Is this too loud?
[04:43.69]I feel like this is way too loud.
[04:46.98]More stuff.
[04:47.82]Revolver.
[04:49.60]And shark teeth.
[04:51.46]From the museum.
[04:52.22]There's a jump.
[04:58.86]That's the Half-Life 1 jump.
[05:04.48]That's good.
[05:04.90]Okay.
[05:05.72]You need the castle key to open this door.
[05:07.18]Equip a wooden stake and alternative fire click.
[05:10.96]You're a wall mount to reach the wooden stick to Okay, so I have to climb like I have to climb like a fucking wall What does it want me to do what did that I don't I what did that see what does that want me to do I
[05:44.83]It said, climb a wall and grab a stick.
[05:51.39]Use the crucifix on water to make it holy.
[05:53.93]Holy water splashed on creatures of darkness from a chalice is a powerful weapon.
[06:00.99]Can I bathe?
[06:03.13]I don't have a crucifix.
[06:07.71]I'm gonna dip my sword in this small health pack.
[06:16.40]There's a stamina meter over there.
[06:17.82]So, I'm gonna go up.
[06:28.18]How do I get over there?
[06:29.32]I guess I have to go like this.
[06:32.98]Oh, Jesus.
[06:34.26]Ah!
[06:40.24]Oh, shit.
[06:40.80]Okay.
[06:41.28]Alright, alright.
[06:41.85]Which one am I going in?
[06:43.77]Chest?
[06:46.08]More shark teeth.
[06:47.86]Another health pack.
[06:48.64]How do I use the health pack?
[06:59.99]Okay, good.
[07:00.35]I just got the shortcut.
[07:03.05]Good for me.
[07:12.42]What the fuck is making this noise?
[07:15.16]What?
[07:15.38]Holy shit.
[07:28.07]That was so loud and so scary.
[07:34.03]I'm not going that fast.
[07:35.08]How do I use a health pack?
[07:36.08]Wait.
[07:38.47]Okay, primary, secondary, reload, drop.
[07:42.57]E or R shift is action.
[07:44.49]Okay, jump is space.
[07:46.17]Show photo.
[07:46.99]Forward, backward, left, right, sprint.
[07:49.11]Inventory up, inventory down, or mouse wheel.
[07:55.77]F5 is quick save.
[07:58.29]One through nine is weapons.
[08:00.55]Okay.
[08:03.96]Wait, that didn't help me at all.
[08:07.01]How do I use a health pack?
[08:08.17]Just... Just... Huh?
[08:12.89]Whatever.
[08:13.31]Because I don't have... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... 9, like... I don't understand.
[08:28.42]Health packs are instant use.
[08:29.60]Okay, so it's just like in Doom.
[08:33.62]Monster going to come out of there.
[08:35.42]That guy's going to get up.
[08:35.98]That's no Esperanto.
[08:37.34]I'm going to end the game right now.
[08:53.35]Wait, who's hitting him?
[08:54.63]Am I hitting him?
[09:02.31]I'm gonna beat him, this is the end of the game!
[09:12.36]Oh shit, what do I do?
[09:13.66]His run is so scary!
[09:18.98]Is he dead?
[09:19.56]Okay, he's dead.
[09:21.28]That took a long time.
[09:22.62]I think he might, like, get up.
[09:27.59]I don't like this game.
[09:28.57]Okay, this is the best one so far.
[09:35.53]Whoa!
[09:36.35]What is just happening to my character?
[09:39.70]How much health do I have?
[09:43.06]That 5 was backwards!
[09:44.90]That 5... How do I use... Is there a block?
[10:14.61]Get me up there.
[10:15.15]I gotta climb up there, obviously.
[10:16.59]Maybe not.
[10:21.21]Oh, you fucking idiot.
[10:26.73]Okay, you don't have to go that way.
[10:28.15]But I gotta watch my stamina.
[10:31.63]Hey, what does a five look like in the mirror?
[10:35.67]There's nothing here.
[10:42.86]Was there anything inside his coffin?
[10:48.41]I don't think I can do anything there.
[10:54.83]Right?
[10:55.19]I mean, I can't... Call me... Tell me I'm stupid if I am.
[11:13.38]You need the west wing key to open this door.
[11:17.40]I'm stupid, am I?
[11:18.16]Oh god, another one.
[11:25.49]I'm gonna fucking die.
[11:26.33]What happens if you die?
[11:29.35]I know this trick.
[11:30.21]Told you I knew this trick.
[11:50.24]Honestly, how are you not supposed to take damage?
[11:54.28]Oh, it's another one of those fucking freaks.
[12:14.10]Shit, I got, oh no, I got mirror five.
[12:24.83]He's not dead.
[12:29.36]I'm gonna lose.
[12:44.17]What do I do about this?
[12:46.71]How are you supposed to not get hurt?
[12:49.48]All the whole thing's randomly generated.
[12:51.12]I forgot.
[12:55.19]I completely forgot about that.
[12:56.29]It's all a random... It's all random... You know what I'm saying?
[12:59.63]Alright, I get it.
[13:08.73]I get it.
[13:09.59]I understand it.
[13:10.11]Okay, that wasn't a die sound.
[13:21.32]That was a... I stubbed my toe.
[13:22.74]Ow, my toe hurts.
[13:26.19]Show photo.
[13:26.97]Alright, let's try that again.
[13:28.31]We're going to be on here for a little while.
[13:30.01]This game's good.
[13:30.59]I like this game.
[13:32.70]So, new game.
[13:34.00]Medium.
[13:35.26]Random generation.
[13:36.10]Alright, calm down peewee Herman.
[13:46.95]Okay, fast.
[13:48.05]You've entered an old stone house.
[13:49.27]Yep, you found your cane sword.
[13:52.56]Main courtyard.
[13:53.46]Uh, bloodstain.
[13:57.16]Tree.
[13:59.39]Let's go left first.
[14:05.09]What the fuck just happened?
[14:06.49]Revolver ammunition.
[14:07.39]Ammo for machine gun, which I don't have yet.
[14:09.97]Alright, we got a doghouse.
[14:13.45]Dog bones.
[14:15.39]Nothing in the dog zone.
[14:19.07]Nothing back there.
[14:19.69]I need to get a... Yeah, I need a gun.
[14:24.31]I need a gun bad.
[14:25.49]This is, like, blocked off.
[14:28.00]It's okay.
[14:28.64]Randomly generated levels.
[14:29.86]What about this door?
[14:35.94]Well, I didn't need those.
[14:37.50]And I picked them both up.
[14:38.56]And that was fucking stupid.
[14:39.64]Because you just get overhealed.
[14:46.16]Okay.
[14:46.30]Yeah, I was gonna say, yeah, yeah, yeah, steak and, uh... I'm gonna go over here.
[15:00.02]There's the dog.
[15:04.00]Found the dog.
[15:04.67]Found the dog.
[15:09.13]Now it's... What happened?
[15:10.41]I killed the dog, so now the whole world wants to take me on, huh?
[15:18.31]What's happening here?
[15:18.97]I don't understand.
[15:20.11]Gun?
[15:21.35]East wing key.
[15:26.91]Oh, God.
[15:29.76]I have the east wing key.
[15:38.73]Where am I?
[15:39.11]Is that where I am?
[15:39.89]I have the east wing... Okay, I can go to the east wing.
[15:49.54]What's that noise?
[15:50.82]This is new music.
[15:51.43]This is different music than I'm used to.
[15:53.09]Is there something moving over there?
[16:02.93]Father evil's encyclopedia of the undead the ghoul represents a more demonic aspect in the spirit world and can spawn anywhere within the castle grounds The ghoul is similar to the vampire and that they are reanimated dead people in human form the ghoul However eats human flesh while the vampire drinks blood the ghoul acts neither by will nor by And will be back away from a holy relic like a crucifix Thanks dad
[16:37.70]Dead people in human form.
[16:43.14]Okay, that thing... I don't like that.
[16:46.08]That's the only organic thing here.
[16:50.00]I gotta go into each porta potty and find the secrets.
[16:55.00]Dad took a shit in every one of these porta potties and left a journal as he was shitting.
[17:01.24]The shadow vampires are fragile and ancient vampires.
[17:04.02]They are hollow and their withering contorted bodies are shrouded only by layers and layers of torn black cloth.
[17:11.69]They fear holy items and are thrown back to the land where the shadows have been facing a crucifix.
[17:16.85]Shadow vampires strike from the shadows unheard of and unseen, making their ambushes extremely lethal.
[17:22.50]You got it.
[17:26.30]So this is just the learn about the monsters area.
[17:32.55]I don't like when the music turns off.
[17:34.28]I don't like when the music turns off.
[17:35.74]Shadow monster!
[17:36.72]Shadow monster!
[17:37.30]Ah, there's more.
[17:56.29]Apparently there's more.
[18:03.12]That didn't just hurt me, did it?
[18:04.96]Damn it.
[18:09.06]There is another one right there.
[18:15.95]What the fuck is hitting me?
[18:24.08]There's nothing even here.
[18:28.68]Dog.
[18:29.02]Magic dog.
[18:29.54]Magic...
[18:39.58]Where was the dog?
[18:46.52]Come on, privacy, privacy, privacy!
[18:49.38]Okay, I'm safe.
[18:50.40]Is that guy barking?
[19:02.92]Or am I in, am I out of my mind?
[19:07.94]He's right there, he's right there, he's gonna jump over.
[19:11.41]Shadow man, I don't think these guys have to correct audio files These guys don't have the right audio it's very clearly dogs barking and shit Already dead
[19:47.71]Bunny hopping dog monsters.
[19:52.36]I know I missed a porta potty, but what am I supposed to do?
[19:54.26]I got the east key.
[19:56.62]I'm gonna go open the east door.
[20:03.51]Let's go to the Looney Tunes door.
[20:07.91]Hold on, where is it?
[20:08.59]East wing.
[20:16.55]What is that?
[20:17.03]Is that... What the fuck?
[20:24.64]Father Adel?
[20:31.55]Perhaps I have half an hour left to live.
[20:33.99]Find Dr. Amersfield and bring him here or I don't think I'll make it.
[20:36.59]You could use the main entrance from where you came as sanctuary.
[20:40.05]The spawns of hell do not venture there.
[20:41.59]Dr. Amersfield, Aunt Emily, Uncle Andrew and Gregory are hiding in the east wing.
[20:46.48]You must find and rescue them to the Sanctuary.
[20:55.03]Crucifix.
[20:56.79]There we go.
[20:57.29]So you just hold it out.
[21:02.01]Does it do anything else?
[21:03.37]Alright, get... I'm gonna put you in a safe place.
[21:25.36]Okay.
[21:30.63]Let's go to the... Let's go on the wet east wing.
[21:34.73]You found a wooden stake.
[21:35.97]Finally.
[21:44.24]They got vile demons!
[21:47.54]What?
[21:55.23]Medium might be too hard.
[22:05.70]Oh, fucking F5.
[22:07.64]Okay, we're not fucking up this time.
[22:10.41]No more messing around.
[22:13.28]I'm not going to get scared and freaking scream.
[22:15.56]Freaking scream.
[22:16.44]What am I, like, Family Guy?
[22:17.62]E-swing.
[22:18.38]Let's just... No, don't touch that.
[22:20.62]I don't need that yet.
[22:22.27]Close this.
[22:22.79]I don't want it.
[22:23.27]I don't need it yet.
[22:24.81]Going right to the E-swing.
[22:36.55]Wait, he... Oh, wait, hold on.
[22:38.71]That...
[22:43.61]Wait.
[22:44.22]Wait.
[22:47.38]He flies out of... Oh, God.
[22:51.08]I need to see that.
[22:58.38]We need to watch that happen.
[22:59.62]I want to get a good view of that.
[23:05.74]Fuck!
[23:06.12]The key!
[23:07.86]Oh, God damn it!
[23:10.38]Oh, that was stonk!
[23:14.36]Don't wait, I need to watch this.
[23:15.50]Fuck!
[23:18.20]It's all randomly generated.
[23:21.72]Let's just watch him fly out so I can at least get that kind of... It didn't even... Dammit.
[23:33.61]Didn't even get to fucking see it either.
[23:34.85]Like, who cares?
[23:36.45]It was meaningless.
[23:37.77]It was absolutely meaningless.
[23:38.83]That was a perfect seed.
[23:46.33]You alright?
[23:46.67]No, we're not touching that.
[23:53.20]I'm gonna get in there.
[23:53.90]I'm gonna get in there with full health.
[23:58.86]Watch out for dogs.
[24:00.60]They have a tendency to be over here.
[24:01.75]At least one.
[24:04.95]Last time it was down here.
[24:06.61]Dog, right?
[24:07.19]Dog.
[24:08.03]Right there.
[24:09.13]Not randomly generated this time, buddy.
[24:17.39]How's that for a generation?
[24:21.19]There it is.
[24:22.93]Key.
[24:23.82]I'm not picking up any health packs.
[24:25.06]I'm not going in there.
[24:26.78]Let's just go right to the east wing.
[24:31.62]How do you counter?
[24:32.28]I don't even think you can.
[24:42.69]Not this time.
[24:43.45]I thought he said this was safe.
[24:45.75]Didn't he say, oh, you're currently in sanctuary.
[24:50.95]Nothing gonna hurt you.
[24:51.81]Fucking lied.
[24:57.44]Okay.
[24:58.04]We're gonna save it.
[24:59.06]F5.
[25:00.28]Game saved.

[25:49.72]What's in here?
[25:52.50]Nothing.
[26:00.44]Where was he?
[26:00.90]Where was that guy?
[26:01.70]Where was he?
[26:02.22]Alright, here's the first father book.
[26:06.70]I'm stuck inside the table.
[26:10.08]Vampires are creatures of the night and during the day they enter a coma-like sleep.
[26:14.61]They have supernatural abilities.
[26:15.71]Vampires avoid garlic, sunlight, sacred symbols such as the crucifix and holy water.
[26:20.73]And they need to sleep on their native soil.
[26:22.42]They may be killed by thrusting a stake through their heart.
[26:26.90]You got it.
[26:28.66]Like this.
[26:43.07]Are these... They're not asleep?
[26:44.25]Those guys aren't asleep.
[26:48.38]There's stuff in there.
[26:48.92]I need a gun.
[26:55.02]God.
[27:00.66]You know exactly what's gonna happen.
[27:02.80]Are they smart enough to use doors?
[27:08.05]Gunpowder.
[27:12.17]A stool?
[27:13.19]No, nothing.
[27:15.75]Okay, well, let's get going.
[27:16.77]Oh, god damn it!
[27:41.74]Where can I get a gun?
[27:42.82]I need to find my family.
[27:48.29]I have all those health packs.
[27:53.81]Is there any holy water?
[27:54.71]Alright, I see a guy.
[27:59.89]That's a vampire, right?
[28:00.67]We're gonna sneak up behind this guy and we're gonna bury this in his chest.
[28:11.26]He's like having a smoke break.
[28:20.01]Don't ever you come back again!
[28:21.31]Oh my god, stop texting me!
[28:39.16]Oh, gee.
[28:39.80]What is this?
[28:40.26]A heavenly aura surrounds the boulder that blocks this path.
[28:44.28]It can only be removed with the aid of God's hand.
[28:46.06]I know how to do that.
[28:52.81]Move, rock.
[28:54.91]Move.
[28:55.25]God commands it.
[28:59.81]I guess that's not how you move it.
[29:00.89]Jesus is not going to move the rock for me, apparently.
[29:09.77]Let's get some stamina back.
[29:21.13]Wah!
[29:21.61]That was a weird noise that a dog doesn't make.
[29:26.47]Through the door, really.
[29:31.90]Alright, there's a chest in here.
[29:34.83]What else is in here?
[29:36.53]Something else is in here.
[29:38.53]This guy.
[29:43.57]Scared?
[29:43.87]You should be!
[29:46.58]Punk!
[29:48.74]Wait!
[29:49.26]What?
[29:49.52]Oh no, it doesn't even hurt him.
[29:57.56]Why does he just take so much hits?
[30:00.27]Jesus!
[30:03.05]I'm so desperate for health now.
[30:04.29]Like, it's bad.
[30:04.97]This is really bad.
[30:05.83]10 HP.
[30:10.29]That sure is a lot.
[30:13.88]That's a lot to be... Yeah, I can work with that.
[30:17.12]Oh, cool.
[30:17.42]I can work with 20 extra health.
[30:24.96]I'm just gonna do a right click the whole time.
[30:29.81]And then back up.
[30:34.09]That don't even matter.
[30:43.94]Is this fucking game even possible?
[30:46.78]You need the garrison key.
[30:48.06]Oh, that's great.
[30:48.94]Wait, do I?
[30:53.86]Damn it.
[31:03.66]Can I left-hand the crucifix?
[31:05.06]I don't think so.
[31:07.81]I don't think I can.
[31:08.41]Yeah, I gotta use those AGDQ strats to get through that door.
[31:15.41]I gotta come back here later.
[31:17.91]It's not over this way.
[31:18.69]It's just right over here.
[31:21.21]We're gonna F5.
[31:24.84]Monsters in this room.
[31:26.76]Probably.
[31:39.75]I would have screamed there if I was looking the right direction.
[31:43.31]You would have heard me scream.
[31:51.84]At least I have more health at this point.
[31:59.31]Don't matter.
[31:59.81]This is where I came from, so we're gonna go up the stairs.
[32:08.62]Keep it queued up just in case you need to do a big swing.
[32:11.46]Someone's gonna run down these stairs.
[32:13.26]It's inevitable.
[32:15.50]Watch the stand.
[32:22.01]Where?
[32:24.05]Where?
[32:25.75]Where?
[32:27.47]What are you talking about?
[32:29.21]Why did the music just do this?
[32:39.16]Dude you missed your music cue.
[32:40.74]Oh my god, I'm gonna die He was late Oh no, they're playing my music and I'm not ready I have an idea how to deal with that guy
[33:07.64]This is how I'm gonna do it.
[33:09.64]Shit.
[33:12.66]Watch this, Freddy.
[33:13.20]Watch this.
[33:13.90]Good.
[33:14.46]They're all... I was gonna say, they're all idiots.
[33:24.74]God damn.
[33:25.24]Okay, they're very, very erratic and they're very stupid.
[33:27.88]So I'm just gonna run them off the cliff.
[33:32.08]It'll be fine.
[33:32.74]I'm gonna get him off the cliff.
[33:34.50]It's- this ga- it's not- the game's not easy to control.
[33:36.61]Give me a little bit of a buh buh buh buh buh buh.
[33:39.77]Here we go, ready?
[33:40.95]Just run around a little.
[33:42.01]He's gonna go off.
[33:49.91]Did he fall?
[33:55.78]Wait.
[34:00.16]Wait, did he get up?
[34:02.26]Wait, I don't understand!
[34:03.40]Oh shi- They're doing the same- This game's fucking perfect.
[34:21.09]Alright, I'm gonna save it here.
[34:24.07]I'm gonna save it right here.
[34:26.15]F5.
[34:28.19]This should work if it's done correctly.
[34:32.09]Oh, no, wait, wait, no, no, no, wait, wait, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[34:35.37]Wait, this is... I have, like, five people chasing me now.
[34:40.58]This is a... Yes, okay, it worked.
[34:47.04]Okay, hold on.
[34:47.76]Amelia.
[34:53.53]Come on.
[34:57.31]No, not again!
[35:03.71]I promise that wasn't on purpose.
[35:06.33]Oh, fucking stop it!
[35:07.65]Just stop it!
[35:08.55]Just fight them!
[35:12.24]Get out of this!
[35:15.00]The vamp- Alright, I think I'm safe.
[35:16.88]I'm safe in this- I'm safe in here.
[35:19.51]The vampiric succubus has captured Greg.
[35:22.01]Hold on, is that me?
[35:24.20]I think that's supposed to be me.
[35:25.46]And it's going to sacrifice him at the top of the raised east clock tower.
[35:28.22]You must rescue him.
[35:29.42]Have you found Dr. Armsfield, Aunt Sophie, and Uncle Andrew and brought them to safety yet?
[35:33.10]You must succeed or they'll be slammed.
[35:35.46]Uncle Andrew?
[35:37.22]And I have a revolver in our trunk at the main entrance.
[35:39.69]Take me there and I'll give it to you.
[35:40.99]Okay, here we go.
[35:51.97]Okay, you're gone.
[35:52.59]Gone.
[35:53.77]What?!
[36:03.18]You guys don't understand, like, how fucking, like, how difficult it is to play.
[36:07.00]Wait, what?
[36:07.32]There's a dog in here!
[36:09.08]Wait!
[36:22.31]She became a dog.
[36:23.15]Oh my god.
[36:24.83]Why?
[36:26.35]She wasn't a dog five times in a row.
[36:29.73]Okay, don't... I'm stuck in brown hog day.
[36:36.84]Fucking god damn it.
[36:45.22]What happened?
[36:49.53]Is she now just a dog permanently?
[37:01.29]Okay, if I stand here, he should just jump at me, right?
[37:03.95]And fall off.
[37:05.48]No, it's a dog!
[37:06.20]It's another dog!
[37:09.12]Why do they keep changing characters?
[37:13.94]Okay, so now that monster is a dog.
[37:15.84]Is this dog also a monster?
[37:18.01]No.
[37:18.81]It's two.
[37:20.13]Almost just fucking fell off again.
[37:24.91]Jesus Christ!
[37:26.07]I'm gonna die.
[37:31.97]Oh my god, it's too much!
[37:36.02]You gonna help back in here?
[37:36.86]Stay alive, stay alive!
[37:48.46]I have 1 HP!
[37:49.06]Nooo!
[38:03.17]I'm not gonna open this door.
[38:06.27]That's the problem I'm having.
[38:07.25]Don't open that door.
[38:09.07]Wait for this guy to come up.
[38:09.83]He's gonna jump off.
[38:10.52]He'll die.
[38:10.98]He's alive.
[38:13.62]Un-fucking-believable.
[38:37.03]Took him a long time to get up here.
[38:38.17]Alright, don't open.
[38:39.31]I have a revolver in the main entrance.
[38:43.65]Take me there.
[38:46.73]We got a good seed.
[38:47.47]There's no F5.
[38:49.27]For Christ's sake.
[38:51.37]What?
[39:04.28]Okay, let's... Let me... I'm not going to close the door this time.
[39:09.07]I'm going to keep it open.
[39:11.03]Okay, give me the health pack.
[39:12.53]Game saved.
[39:13.81]What?
[39:14.01]No, no, no.
[39:14.29]How do I get her to leave?
[39:35.70]Isn't she supposed to follow me?
[39:37.78]To the main entrance?
[39:40.28]Okay, here she comes.
[39:40.86]Good.
[39:42.45]You gotta open the door.
[39:46.99]You're not, like, a fucking idiot, are you?
[39:51.73]Why is she jumping?
[39:59.15]Okay.
[39:59.65]Thank God you don't jump.
[40:04.77]Alright, F5.
[40:11.21]Take her to the main entrance.
[40:13.23]This is not the main entrance.
[40:14.31]We went the wrong way.
[40:15.17]Come on.
[40:20.45]She turns into the scream whenever we stop.
[40:22.65]She really does.
[40:24.65]And it is the Dark Souls, Grandma.
[40:25.93]You're right.
[40:27.27]Every game has been Dark Souls tonight for some reason.
[40:33.50]No, don't go that way.
[40:35.62]I'm going to actually get a gun.
[40:37.60]Isn't that exciting?
[40:38.78]I'm excited for this.
[40:41.60]Watch out for the big spawn that's going to be behind the door right in front of us somewhere.
[40:44.60]No, we're safe still.
[40:45.92]These guys are going to get up.
[40:47.66]Alright, can you run?
[40:49.68]Because all these guys are standing.
[40:54.95]She just fell down.
[41:00.63]Well, just keep your footing.
[41:03.93]We're almost there.
[41:06.58]Almost.
[41:08.32]Out into the main entrance.
[41:09.94]And I'm gonna get a gun.
[41:12.30]Finally.
[41:14.82]Come on up.
[41:15.18]Alright, here's this guy.
[41:23.31]Do I have to, like, say something?
[41:24.27]Okay, let's go.
[41:26.63]Main entrance.
[41:34.91]Run.
[41:37.77]Where's my gun?
[41:40.09]Where's my gun?
[41:42.19]Main entrance.
[41:49.35]Like, up here?
[41:50.17]I don't think I can go in here yet.
[41:58.50]Where's your briefcase with the gun?
[42:15.54]Do I have to take her, like, outside the whole game?
[42:17.37]Like, out here?
[42:18.01]Come on.
[42:29.51]There we go.
[42:30.08]Here's, like, where the Pikmin is.
[42:31.78]Here's a revolver.
[42:37.36]Beautiful.
[42:39.02]Finally!
[42:43.03]Just lost five shots.
[42:44.85]How?
[42:45.61]Why?
[42:46.45]Why did I lose five shots?
[42:48.80]I had five out of five.
[42:49.58]Now I have five out of zero.
[42:51.12]Alright, that's... That's not gonna be like that, is it?
[43:07.27]That's bullshit.
[43:08.13]I'm reloading.
[43:09.59]That's horseshit.
[43:12.63]I like reloaded the gun or something.
[43:16.95]I pressed R. So do not press R. I have 10 shots.
[43:25.53]You're welcome.
[43:27.17]Now we gotta find the rest of the family.
[43:30.49]Still in East Tower, right?
[43:34.53]Yeah, do not press the reload button.
[43:36.59]I'm not even gonna use it.
[43:39.35]But I am gonna get the health packs.
[43:41.82]Because I need them.
[43:43.66]Now is the time to use them.
[43:47.40]Alright, back into... Back to the pit.
[43:53.86]What do I have?
[43:54.20]What do I have for keys?
[43:55.30]I still have just East Wing.
[43:58.14]Alright, I got... You.
[44:00.74]Alright.
[44:02.38]Back we go!
[44:05.21]Loot all the boxes?
[44:06.17]I can't.
[44:07.37]I can't open them.
[44:10.27]I could go there, but no.
[44:13.74]Back to the east wing.
[44:17.08]And we're gonna go over here this time, because I did not go this way.
[44:19.92]We're gonna save.
[44:20.79]There we go.
[44:25.93]Save it again.
[44:30.14]What is that, a brick?
[44:31.60]Revolver ammo.
[44:33.30]Now I got... That's gonna fuck me up.
[44:36.67]Is it weird?
[44:37.35]Is it absolutely out of control?
[44:39.65]We were talking about reversing and things being upside down.
[44:42.73]And this game has it... Can they hear me?
[44:47.76]Are they listening?
[44:48.80]Is somebody fucking listening to me talk?
[45:12.53]Gunpowder.
[45:14.59]Gunpowder.
[45:15.17]What the hell is going on up here?
[45:23.73]Yes, 2,200, 2,300 people are listening.
[45:25.30]Well, I know, I mean, like, it's like somebody else controlling me.
[45:28.62]Somebody else controlling my environment right now?
[45:35.74]Well, that was not worth going in there.
[45:37.86]I didn't get anything.
[45:40.72]Uh... Well, looks like we have to continue to go the way that we were going already.
[45:45.82]Uh, no.
[45:46.12]Actually, this way.
[45:52.85]Let's try it.
[45:53.49]I want to try the gun.
[45:57.83]Hmm.
[46:08.90]I mean, it's like... It's pretty good.
[46:12.20]It's not the best, but it's not terrible either.
[46:16.78]This is a good room for health, and I'm not going to accidentally reload.
[46:20.49]Nothing can happen in there.
[46:27.69]Green lights lead to people.
[46:30.45]Okay.
[46:40.94]That sounds like a large animal.
[46:42.90]That sounds like a large monster.
[46:44.27]That sounds very large.
[46:55.69]It is large!
[46:56.63]What is that?
[46:58.43]What is that thing?
[47:02.19]Huh?
[47:02.83]What do I do about this?
[47:03.89]Oh, he's just like a gastrous person!
[47:10.70]Stay away from me!
[47:13.44]What do I do about this?
[47:14.04]I don't know how to do this.
[47:14.82]What do I do?
[47:18.49]Like that?
[47:20.35]Okay.
[47:20.69]Like that.
[47:23.21]Huh?
[47:23.71]I still hear him.
[47:25.27]Man.
[47:27.93]Alright.
[47:28.23]Well... I got full health.
[47:34.47]Nothing else in here.
[47:35.33]Let's save it.
[47:37.09]I'm actually... I'm getting, like, into this game.
[47:38.67]This game's fun.
[47:43.39]I still hear somebody.
[47:52.63]Remember, this game is Nosferatu.
[47:56.51]Nosferatu.
[47:59.25]Pick it up on... Where did I get this?
[48:02.47]I think this is on GOG.
[48:07.25]I believe this is on GOG.com.
[48:11.38]I gotta beat the game.
[48:12.32]Oh, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to do that.
[48:14.59]Games with a timer?
[48:16.73]There is some kind of timer going.
[48:18.01]I'm not exactly sure what that means, but... I knew they were gonna get up at some point.
[48:25.68]Okay, I'm safe down here.
[48:29.22]Looks like... He's... Come on!
[48:34.94]That's a vampire!
[48:36.96]That's a vampire...
[48:54.22]I knew that was going to happen.
[48:55.20]I just didn't know when.
[48:57.26]There's another one down there.
[48:59.44]We're not going over there yet.
[49:08.31]Fuck me.
[49:11.41]Revolver ammo.
[49:13.15]Just wait for the guy to break through the ceiling or something, right?
[49:15.33]It's going to happen.
[49:15.91]I don't want that yet.
[49:23.18]What key do I need?
[49:23.84]I need the east tower key.
[49:29.15]Where the hell am I supposed to get that?
[49:37.49]I don't think I can kill these two guys.
[49:39.09]I think they're going to keep getting up.
[49:44.60]Let's see.
[49:46.94]I can totally just... Yeah.
[49:51.04]Are these gonna be like the bones from Super Mario?
[49:54.70]I'm just testing my theory.
[49:56.70]I don't think they can be killed.
[49:59.98]Alright, they can be killed, but it just takes a lot of hits.
[50:13.13]I think I want the gun.
[50:16.11]Yeah, we're going gun.
[50:23.57]I'm not messing around with another one of those guys.
[50:25.43]I'm putting a bullet right in their head.
[50:26.55]Alright, there's that.
[50:29.49]I remember I couldn't do anything about this.
[50:33.08]Right?
[50:33.52]This was nothing up here.
[50:37.46]Man with a golden gun.
[50:40.40]Yeah, this is the garrison.
[50:41.46]I don't have the garrison key.
[50:45.43]The gun reload is five frames of animation.
[50:49.29]Nothing in here.
[50:56.30]I keep forgetting to do that.
[51:00.22]It'd be easier if I was a vampire.
[51:01.64]Yeah, it would be.
[51:04.88]You are right about that.
[51:06.96]Um, this way.
[51:08.64]So the room, I gotta just keep going after I save that lady.
[51:12.47]Up here on the nightmare stairs.
[51:15.13]So I'm gonna open this door and two guys are gonna come out.
[51:18.53]Like I said, Groundhog Day.
[51:19.39]We're just back to square one.
[51:26.23]Right here.
[51:26.55]Here we go.
[51:28.65]Game saved.
[51:29.51]Open her up.
[51:30.25]Here comes two guys.
[51:32.84]Are they gonna open?
[51:38.20]They don't open doors.
[51:39.50]There's one down.
[51:44.44]And... Oh, come on.
[51:49.34]You... Alright.
[51:50.96]That was bullshit.
[51:53.15]Another one?
[51:54.49]Huh?
[51:54.99]I hear him.
[51:55.33]Where is he?
[52:02.18]Go.
[52:02.48]Fall.
[52:03.26]Fall.
[52:03.46]You too.
[52:03.84]Go on.
[52:08.57]Still alive?
[52:09.91]Still alive.
[52:13.53]Go ahead.
[52:13.83]Make your own.
[52:14.19]Make your own.
[52:14.59]Come on.
[52:14.91]All the way up.
[52:17.18]Figure it out.
[52:17.76]You'll do it.
[52:18.24]You little gremlin asshole.
[52:19.44]Come on.
[52:23.68]Did he just do that?
[52:33.21]That's so scary.
[52:41.58]Where?
[52:41.82]There's some kind of weird portal here.
[52:45.08]Do I touch this?
[52:45.58]Jesus Christ.
[52:56.89]That doesn't do anything.
[53:04.97]I don't know this is this is not hurting me.
[53:08.17]It's just loud Okay, well no garrison again Jump in it Only one only one
[53:36.59]Uh-huh.
[53:43.53]This game is not easy.
[53:52.12]Stop going silent!
[53:54.64]That makes me think that something's gonna be behind the door and jump out and scream at me.
[54:03.83]Steak.
[54:09.43]Monsters?
[54:10.75]Dog.
[54:11.15]I think there's a couple of monsters, actually.
[54:14.18]Oh, for the love of God!
[54:22.52]That was... I'm not going to save right here.
[54:23.74]That was too much damage to take.
[54:32.29]No, I still am not going to save it.
[54:35.39]I might just die right in this room.
[54:42.85]East tower.
[54:43.83]Okay.
[54:48.35]Who's in here?
[54:49.09]A guy.
[54:49.81]Alright, is this like a family member?
[54:55.87]I hope that wasn't a family member.
[55:00.77]No, that was just a guy with a scythe.
[55:04.16]He just took a dump and he came out swinging.
[55:13.06]That was a crazed Uncle Scythe.
[55:15.34]Garrison 1.
[55:15.86]Wait, let me... I want to check.
[55:21.16]There's probably items in this door here.
[55:26.52]Back away.
[55:28.14]Get out of here.
[55:30.34]Not right now.
[55:31.24]Not today.
[55:32.14]Anybody else?
[55:38.89]I hear something.
[55:42.07]Ugh.
[55:43.29]God damn it.
[55:46.19]How many of these rooms are there?
[55:49.58]Now I'm gonna save it.
[55:52.48]Yes, now I will.
[55:53.98]Perfect time.
[55:54.40]A gran- a gran- a grampire.
[55:59.42]That's just gran- that's like a grandfather vampire.
[56:02.69]You know, a grampire is worst.
[56:04.95]Deathly sacred.
[56:13.99]Do I hear anybody else?
[56:18.39]Stakes.
[56:19.35]I need to start using these.
[56:22.23]Bullets.
[56:24.05]More stakes.
[56:26.39]Alright, just free shit.
[56:27.46]You got it.
[56:28.28]Ten.
[56:28.98]I'll reload it.
[56:31.40]Five.
[56:31.86]Okay.
[56:32.30]Don't do that again.
[56:32.92]Oh, fuck!
[56:42.49]Come on!
[56:43.99]Come on.
[56:47.25]How are you implying that I didn't get him?
[56:50.15]Alright, I'm starting to understand the audio cues.
[57:03.10]That sound, that means a dog.
[57:09.02]Let's go back to where I was.
[57:15.91]I don't remember these.
[57:16.47]Do you remember those guys?
[57:17.99]I don't.
[57:34.11]Gotta be... Gotta be good with the shots.
[57:36.87]Otherwise, we ain't gonna do shit.
[57:38.73]Not gonna happen.
[57:39.39]Know what I mean?
[57:47.90]I'm like, I like actually concentrating.
[57:51.34]Welcome to the real video game part of the stream.
[57:54.98]Where I have to try.
[57:55.80]And not lose.
[57:59.57]Garrison key.
[58:00.45]A lot of doors need the garrison key.
[58:09.11]Dog.
[58:09.97]There's a lot of stuff in here.
[58:12.39]Oh, goddammit!
[58:14.44]Oh, that's a lot of people.
[58:15.56]A lot of people.
[58:16.12]A lot of bad people.
[58:17.44]And not only are there bad people, I gotta get the stakes up.
[58:21.50]You know... God.
[58:24.68]Goddammit.
[58:36.48]Right in the chest.
[58:37.08]Get out here.
[58:48.23]Really?
[58:49.11]Really?
[58:50.19]Really?
[58:51.51]Really?
[58:53.35]Like, really?
[58:59.02]That was an outrageous move set.
[59:02.78]I'm killing the first guy with a gun.
[59:07.10]Yeah, look at all this cool shit.
[59:08.34]Where is he?
[59:08.80]Comes out here.
[59:09.28]Come on.
[59:12.38]I gotta get the dog.
[59:13.73]Dog is vulnerable to sword.
[59:19.99]There he comes.
[59:30.59]Who's gonna come out here first?
[59:31.57]I don't know who it is.
[59:32.33]I don't know who it's gonna be.
[59:33.05]Snake?
[59:40.76]Almost.
[59:41.16]Come on.
[59:46.74]Why do you have to be so dumb?
[59:56.65]Now you get intelligent.
[60:04.70]That guy has a stake in his chest.
[60:07.12]Where's the guy with the stake?
[60:10.58]There he is.
[60:14.70]Why are you still alive?
[60:17.76]You have a knife in your chest.
[60:19.02]A stake is sticking out of you.
[60:21.56]This guy's not even a vampire.
[60:28.44]Did I get him?
[60:32.23]Okay.
[60:33.45]Thank you for acting.
[60:34.95]Appreciate it.
[60:40.85]Okay.
[60:41.96]Ammo.
[60:43.06]He's faking it.
[60:43.76]That guy fake died.
[60:45.26]Oh no.
[60:48.86]I'm in deep trouble.
[60:50.02]I might as well pretend to be dead.
[60:51.58]What was that noise?
[61:00.19]That sounded bad.
[61:00.77]It sounded like a new enemy type.
[61:05.65]Wait.
[61:05.95]Didn't it say something about going like this?
[61:13.38]Wait, come here.
[61:15.96]Okay.
[61:17.32]So I just have the... Okay, so it just lights up the area better.
[61:21.15]I feel ya.
[61:22.75]Open up the door.
[61:24.05]Save your family for crying out loud.
[61:28.53]What was that?
[61:30.42]Was this a person right there?
[61:31.60]You all saw it.
[61:34.76]You saw that, right?
[61:36.18]Am I crazy?
[61:37.42]There was a guy lying here.
[61:42.68]That was the door.
[61:44.52]Huh?
[61:44.68]What do you mean, the door?
[61:53.32]I know I'm not crazy.
[61:56.73]New key.
[62:00.51]Oh.
[62:02.05]Okay.
[62:03.49]Whoa!
[62:11.04]This is the 11th hour.
[62:11.94]You have one hour left until midnight.
[62:16.32]I don't get it.
[62:16.70]What?
[62:16.92]What do you mean?
[62:22.42]I have to beat the whole game in an hour.
[62:24.77]Is that what that's trying to tell me?
[62:29.17]I have one hour to beat the game.
[62:32.11]Honestly, where was that tower?
[62:36.48]Garrison.
[62:38.32]I forget.
[62:38.54]I think it was down here.
[62:43.11]Yeah, pretty good Majora's Mask.
[62:46.99]Go play Majora's Mask, buddy.
[62:53.61]Nosferatu can't wait all night, man.
[62:56.61]You need the garrison key.
[62:57.95]So where was the tower key?
[63:03.14]Is there a way to get more stamina?
[63:16.43]Come on.
[63:18.62]Come on.
[63:21.98]Why did I even come in here?
[63:24.78]There was no reason to be in here.
[63:26.04]There was nothing.
[63:29.56]I just wasted like 10 bullets.
[63:38.53]Whatever.
[63:38.89]That shit's going to keep happening, isn't it?
[63:48.58]I forget where the tower entrance was.
[63:53.46]58... Am I liking this game?
[63:54.50]It... Yeah.
[63:59.17]It's actually fairly... It's actually fairly fun.
[64:03.71]It's an old school kind of game, and it's very unforgiving, but... It's still interesting enough where it's keeping me playing.
[64:16.45]Torch burnt out.
[64:17.17]Let's get a new torch.
[64:25.99]Garrison 1.
[64:26.73]No, I need the tower.
[64:32.78]Is that the tower?
[64:34.96]Beast Tower!
[64:35.76]A thunder rages across the sky as Father Avril says goodbye.
[64:39.60]You caved in under the pressure of stress and so did friends and family.
[64:42.72]It was a bloody mess.
[64:44.22]Father Avril just died.
[64:49.72]Okay.
[65:20.13]So what?
[65:23.29]Oh, okay.
[65:23.93]I'm not going to get the good ending anymore.
[65:28.57]Oh, whatever.
[65:29.45]I pushed him off the cliff before anyways.
[65:31.01]That doesn't... Who cares?
[65:34.14]Anything else?
[65:39.54]Oh, this is going up.
[65:40.78]I want to check out down for... Not even going to let you see it.
[65:45.69]Not even going to give you guys the satisfaction of seeing it.
[65:50.50]I'm gonna go down first.
[65:55.84]Is that water?
[65:56.64]It actually might be water.
[66:04.17]There's something big down here.
[66:08.23]Get out of my face.
[66:09.13]Wow!
[66:14.70]I did not expect them to be right up here.
[66:16.60]Fuck, that hurt.
[66:17.40]That was scary.
[66:18.32]I'm going to lose.
[66:19.42]I'm going to go... I did not expect them to be up here.
[66:27.44]Goddamn.
[66:29.59]Okay, so get out there, Crucifix.
[66:33.79]They are smart enough to run all the way around very...
[66:41.45]That hurt me.
[66:42.85]It was trying to kill me and it didn't let it.
[66:46.44]The game tried to do the death animation from this high.
[66:50.08]Really?
[66:55.17]Why was that different?
[66:56.89]Okay, I'm ready for them.
[67:01.79]The thing is, they're shadows, so it's hard to see them.
[67:03.47]Here they come.
[67:09.51]I still took damage.
[67:18.45]There's probably health down here, give me like a- I like how you can- it lights up the actual whole area, that's cool.
[67:36.51]Alright, this is where I gotta be careful.
[67:39.15]So we went down.
[67:40.03]Now we're just in another spot with all this trash.
[67:53.20]I feel like we keep seeing the same exact area.
[67:55.20]This is a really popular asset, I will say.
[67:58.21]Oh wait, no, did I just open a shortcut or something?
[68:09.32]I'm confused.
[68:09.94]I am very confused.
[68:15.13]We've already... Okay, we've already been here.
[68:18.91]Well, that would have been like the third or fourth time we've seen that, so... It's an Oblivion mod.
[68:35.80]Okay, so that was just the other side to get up to here.
[68:38.50]So this was completely and totally pointless.
[68:40.70]There's no reason for me to come down here.
[68:44.76]Literal, absolute zero.
[68:46.67]So, did I have 21 health?
[68:49.71]I think I gained 1 HP by coming down here.
[68:54.17]Okay.
[68:55.89]Let's go.
[69:02.32]Dark Souls...
[69:09.94]What is that?
[69:10.80]Okay, this is still going.
[69:14.03]That does something.
[69:15.99]That other platform.
[69:16.99]I could have jumped to it, but I would have died.
[69:19.05]Alright, let's go.
[69:23.70]Your torch is burnt out.
[69:25.40]Oh well.
[69:28.00]Aunt Sophie!
[69:30.66]James, look up.
[69:31.22]I'm here.
[69:32.12]A dark clothed foul beast and his henchmen lowered me down to a hole at the top of this tower and left me here to hang.
[69:38.17]I'm sure it's a trap.
[69:39.35]Beware, James.
[69:40.03]Try and find a way to lower me down and rescue me.
[69:46.61]Is somebody shooting a gun?
[69:52.67]What is going on right here?
[70:00.26]What?
[70:04.11]You are... Okay.
[70:12.22]Well, I have to use my gun.
[70:15.40]It has three... This is going to take forever again.
[70:20.37]Fuck me.
[70:26.03]I got Nosferatu to number 41 on Twitch.
[70:30.43]Well, good.
[70:30.91]This game's cool.
[70:32.63]I want to try it.
[70:38.50]It's just, okay, it's just, it was moving down.
[70:42.10]Easy, guys.
[70:43.24]Easy, I'll figure it out.
[70:44.32]It takes me a little while, but sometimes I, sometimes I figure it out.
[70:47.94]Now we just have to wait, and then I'm gonna save the second we get up there.
[71:01.69]Okay.
[71:03.87]Now we are solid.
[71:06.07]At least I think so.
[71:10.51]Saved the game.
[71:12.31]Sniped the guy that's shooting at Aunt May.
[71:16.71]Got us up into more trouble.
[71:18.73]There's this guy right there.
[71:23.37]I saved Aunt May.
[71:25.21]Spider-Man 4 can now happen.
[71:26.81]Oh, come on.
[71:27.33]Really?
[71:29.51]God damn it.
[71:36.88]How am I supposed to deal with a guy with a rifle?
[71:42.08]He's... I don't have any more bullets.
[71:46.53]He's gonna snipe me every time.
[71:50.19]I'm actually gonna die every time here.
[71:56.37]Do I... Can I throw something at him?
[72:04.51]Is he scared of the cross?
[72:05.90]Let's see.
[72:06.20]He might be.
[72:10.45]No.
[72:12.87]Some guy's coming at me with a cross.
[72:15.31]Like I'm gonna be scared of it.
[72:25.64]I'm trying to like just be erratic.
[72:37.28]Got it.
[72:40.35]I jumped over the bullet.
[72:45.93]I got it.
[72:46.19]Holy shit, I win.
[72:46.86]I got a musket.
[72:50.56]There's 21 shots in here.
[72:52.38]Save the game.
[73:03.21]This thing is so powerful.
[73:08.41]Give me his... I want...
[73:13.22]Didn't even hurt me.
[73:14.12]Alright, Aunt May.
[73:14.86]Let's see what I can do here.
[73:15.70]Wait, hold on.
[73:22.34]Save.
[73:25.24]I saw bullets somewhere.
[73:26.18]No, it's health.
[73:27.98]Good.
[73:28.28]Beautiful.
[73:28.68]Save it.
[73:28.92]I think I'm going to need to go all the way up to the top.
[73:34.98]Yeah, pretty good.
[73:38.64]This is like a submarine missile launching crosshair.
[73:47.03]It's almost... What is this?
[73:51.45]Keep going up higher?
[73:53.01]Is it like a... Okay, this looks like a pulley system over here.
[73:56.08]Oh, boy.
[73:58.18]I think we got to a boss.
[74:05.50]Give the... Batboy.
[74:09.12]Time to fight Batboy.
[74:13.53]Found a wooden stake.
[74:14.61]Well, I definitely have to use them here.
[74:15.77]Right in the chest.
[74:32.18]Well... I don't know how I'm supposed to kill him.
[74:36.50]I'm sure there's some special way.
[74:41.98]And I didn't... Well, there's another health pack here, too.
[74:48.36]I didn't even get this one, so I missed it last time.
[74:51.49]So I pull her up through after I kill Batboy.
[74:53.87]That was a large health pack that was trying to prepare me, and I just completely missed it.
[74:58.71]Okay, save.
[75:01.72]So I need to stab him, and then should I take the sword out, or should I try to punch him in the face?
[75:09.39]Here we go.
[75:10.17]Right in the chest.
[75:14.38]And then... That hurts him.
[75:20.06]That hurts.
[75:20.54]He can't take the cross.
[75:21.40]Dodge.
[75:34.55]Almost dead?
[75:35.94]No?
[75:36.70]I mean, it was a cutscene for this guy.
[75:40.56]That hurt a lot.
[75:51.49]I win.
[75:53.25]I just beat Nosferatu.
[75:54.21]I just killed him.
[75:55.64]I made him turn into a bunch of fucking bugs and he flew away.
[76:04.32]Take the power of Christ.
[76:06.24]You goddamn demon.
[76:08.36]Alright, now pull this lever.
[76:11.13]How do I save Grandma?
[76:12.29]I'm sure I don't miss anything up here.
[76:16.31]That's creepy.
[76:22.01]Did he just come back?
[76:24.50]You need the Desmondu Vampire Key.
[76:29.18]Did he drop it when he died?
[76:33.18]I don't have that.
[76:36.29]Just stay in the air.
[76:36.95]Let me try... Did I... Hello?
[76:44.06]Did that just steal my gun?
[76:51.78]What the fuck was that?
[76:57.06]I'm not taking that.
[76:59.86]I'm not losing that health.
[77:04.57]I mean, I know to pull this lever, but I don't want to miss anything.
[77:08.32]I need the Desmond Mundule Vampire key.
[77:14.76]So I didn't get the key.
[77:20.57]I think a bat may have just hit me, so I can't save her.
[77:25.15]The lever doesn't do anything.
[77:26.93]What are you talking about?
[77:30.42]I can't do it.
[77:30.94]I have to unlock it.
[77:41.33]I got one.
[77:41.85]I got one.
[77:54.85]Oh.
[78:00.33]What happens when I get them all?
[78:08.85]It moves pretty goddamn fast.
[78:14.52]That's kind of hard to see.
[78:16.72]I got a ball.
[78:24.11]That's not doing anything for me.
[78:32.38]Well, that was a waste of like six bullets.
[78:34.68]I don't think I'm gonna reload.
[78:50.60]I don't think they anticipated somebody doing that.
[79:01.93]Well, when you... I need the... Did he... Did I... God.
[79:07.11]So, he...
[79:22.51]I can go down here.
[79:23.29]That was like an awkward save, but I'm gonna die in here.
[79:38.59]Come on.
[79:40.33]Come on!
[79:43.64]Devs, no idiot's gonna walk off the map.
[79:48.92]You have to give me some credit here.
[79:50.84]That doesn't even make any sense.
[79:54.59]Just very easily.
[79:56.37]Slowly.
[79:58.87]Okay.
[80:01.13]That looks pretty ominous.
[80:03.39]I'm gonna get a stake ready.
[80:06.20]I ain't gonna get fucked over here.
[80:08.58]I'm holding... It's queued up.
[80:10.28]I'm waiting for this motherfucker to open.
[80:12.00]It's a Crypt Keeper.
[80:12.96]The Crypt Keeper's gonna open this thing and it's gonna go... Oh!
[80:14.70]Uh...
[80:33.30]Well, I got him.
[80:37.03]I got him real good.
[80:38.21]That's some Animaniac shit right there.
[80:52.61]Uh, the ancient vampire lord Malachi was fettered onto a tomb within the heart of the main castle building hundreds of years ago at the end of the Crimson War.
[81:01.66]The tome was constructed by the enemies of the vampire lord to keep him from returning.
[81:06.10]Grandma's gonna die.
[81:07.12]Like, it's time to... Excuse me.
[81:08.70]I don't have time to read.
[81:11.64]Grandma is about to die.
[81:19.49]Just take all of his shit.
[81:24.95]Okay, don't ever press R ever again.
[81:28.57]Because when you press R, it deletes a bullet.
[81:31.90]And don't do it.
[81:32.66]It's stupid.
[81:33.96]Somebody forgot... How?
[81:37.52]I'm not gonna pretend to know.
[81:41.78]Alright, I'm coming, Grandma.
[81:47.35]I'll be there soon.
[81:48.45]I promise.
[81:49.71]I gotta steal all this guy's stuff.
[81:55.45]Alright, back up.
[81:57.71]Up to here.
[82:01.24]How do I get out of this?
[82:02.16]How do I get out of this shithole?
[82:05.20]Can I not climb back up?
[82:07.58]Alright, come on.
[82:09.88]Save Grandma.
[82:11.08]So I can get Grandma's blowtorch.
[82:12.75]Whatever the hell she has.
[82:13.53]Alright, here we go.
[82:27.05]Open this.
[82:29.03]Unlock this.
[82:31.93]Alright, come on, Grandma.
[82:34.71]Let's see if we can save her.
[82:36.49]Uh-uh.
[82:45.40]Grandma?
[82:47.42]Grandma?
[82:54.92]Did I kill her?
[82:56.52]Hold on.
[83:03.26]That was me getting hit by a bat.
[83:04.72]I thought that was Grandma's head hitting the ceiling.
[83:10.31]She was right there.
[83:10.93]She fell down.
[83:11.79]Just don't get hit by any bats.
[83:18.15]Okay.
[83:19.85]Lower Grandma.
[83:20.75]Make her safe.
[83:22.93]F5.
[83:24.81]Grandma, your grandson is here.
[83:26.25]I saved the day.
[83:29.57]Now give me some of those fresh cookies that I've so used.
[83:39.67]Where is she?
[83:46.42]Why am I walking down the stairs so oddly?
[83:49.55]Did I like shrink?
[83:50.23]I feel like something's going on here.
[83:51.52]I should be like much higher.
[84:16.50]Let's go, Grandma.
[84:18.70]Oh, okay.
[84:20.00]Grandma, this is not how we were supposed to do this.
[84:25.46]Grandma, we... I'm gonna blame that one on Grandma.
[84:43.68]Grandma, like, grandma got, like, stuck.
[84:46.82]Don't get stuck again.
[84:48.76]Like me, I'm stuck again.
[84:50.14]I'm stuck again.
[84:50.66]Now I'm on top of her.
[84:53.15]This is just not right.
[84:54.43]You guys can't see what's happening.
[84:55.67]Like, this is not right.
[84:57.01]The same, look, okay, watch this.
[85:01.37]Oh, God.
[85:03.66]I can't touch any buttons during this.
[85:18.30]If you touch a button, you float and it fucks the whole thing up.
[85:27.83]I didn't touch any buttons that time and it's still fucked up.
[85:29.87]This is not the way this is supposed to be done.
[85:37.31]I'm floating in the air right now.
[85:49.17]No, don't!
[85:49.95]Go back!
[85:50.67]Fucking God.
[85:51.15]No!
[85:53.93]No!
[85:54.17]Stop it!
[85:54.53]I just wanted to get her to follow me again.
[86:18.35]I was trying to get her to fo- Oh my god.
[86:30.93]The end.
[86:50.31]that was very gentle I let her down very really slowly okay get off the ride we have another one to go on no follow me she was about to walk off do we have to go all the way down okay I think I think the what's the fastest way to get out of here
[87:18.52]I don't know.
[87:19.76]We might actually should have gone down.
[87:21.04]Because we got a long way to go, I think.
[87:24.72]I'm trying to remember the exact way to go.
[87:33.07]I think we do have to go down.
[87:40.73]Yeah, let's go down.
[87:41.93]I'll be ready for the shadow people.
[87:45.60]Alright, Granny, let's go.
[87:51.06]Alright, one, two, three.
[87:54.74]Good job, you made it.
[87:55.84]Now I'm just going to be aware.
[87:58.32]Here they come.
[88:01.54]No, wait, are they dead?
[88:02.18]I think they're dead.
[88:03.53]Where are they?
[88:08.35]What?
[88:08.57]Shit.
[88:18.08]She walked off.
[88:19.54]She fucking walked off the edge.
[88:21.66]What else would she do?
[88:23.60]Right?
[88:24.18]Like, what else would you do?
[88:30.94]I have to keep an eye on her the whole time.
[88:32.52]Dude, I don't care.
[88:36.61]I don't care.
[88:40.41]Don't do that again.
[88:41.45]Here they come.
[88:43.25]Just don't... She fucking did it again!
[88:46.15]Oh, come on!
[88:58.82]Where is she?
[89:02.96]Let's go.
[89:03.26]You know, how do I make you stay?
[89:11.97]Stay here until it's safe.
[89:16.49]Stay there.
[89:17.25]Let me clear the monsters and then... Okay, yeah.
[89:21.65]Stay.
[89:28.24]Bring them on.
[89:29.68]Here they come.
[89:32.69]Being on the stairs is actually very, very annoying.
[89:36.71]Okay.
[89:38.29]Alright, Grandma.
[89:40.27]That's two dead.
[89:41.00]Let's get a save here.
[89:42.62]I'm ready to bring her down.
[89:52.63]Let's go.
[89:54.37]You need to get out of the way, though.
[89:55.49]Alright.
[89:56.15]Let's go.
[89:58.03]She's following.
[90:06.55]Slow, Grandma.
[90:08.62]Slow.
[90:13.82]I don't think she's ever gonna be able to do this.
[90:21.06]I don't think she understands this very well.
[90:24.71]This was supposed to be the fastest way to go down, and it's turning into the absolute slowest.
[90:35.23]Okay.
[90:36.43]Don't... Follow me.
[90:38.07]Come on.
[90:56.54]Good.
[90:57.08]You're doing a really good job.
[90:59.30]I'm going to need you to stay on that pace.
[91:02.20]Come on.
[91:03.66]I think I just have to be looking at her and she'll do it correctly.
[91:09.47]That's right.
[91:09.99]Keep going.
[91:11.43]Good work.
[91:13.83]Look, you made it.
[91:15.31]And it only took you like nine attempts.
[91:18.83]Save.
[91:24.71]Make sure I don't miss anything from down here.
[91:26.77]Okay.
[91:30.26]Save it.
[91:31.52]Let's go, Grandma.
[91:32.22]I'm gonna reload.
[91:36.88]What the hell was that?
[91:42.46]Oh!
[91:43.22]Oh!
[91:48.83]So I get, like, Billy's cage key.
[91:53.16]Anybody have any idea what Billy's cage is?
[91:54.86]Alright.
[92:00.36]Another one rescued.
[92:02.10]Job well done.
[92:06.30]Another job done.
[92:07.31]No, no.
[92:08.11]I don't want you to go that way.
[92:09.07]No, no.
[92:09.35]We need to go across the bridge.
[92:14.97]Really?
[92:15.75]I skipped.
[92:17.65]He's dead.
[92:20.92]Nice, like, NBA 2K17 face mapping software.
[92:27.59]Back to the entrance.
[92:29.45]Am I gonna play Assassin's Creed Origins?
[92:31.45]Um... I don't think so.
[92:34.49]I have, like, no intention to.
[92:39.51]So where's this cage?
[92:44.11]There's a lot of family members that I'm not going to rescue.
[92:53.79]Wolfenstein 2 might be fun, but I feel like... Is Wolfenstein 2 just kind of a... shooter?
[92:58.76]It's like a shooter, right?
[93:02.16]It's just... Is it like just a default first-person shooter?
[93:07.48]Or is it worth playing?
[93:18.65]What is Buster?
[93:19.53]I don't know.
[93:22.23]I know that this is back where I was.
[93:27.27]Is it just like a generic shooter?
[93:28.97]It's an FPS with a good story, great acting, and sexy.
[93:31.57]Well, we all know.
[93:32.38]Apparently all about those lately for some reason, somehow.
[93:43.06]Alright.
[93:44.68]Where to now?
[93:51.70]It's not a good stream game, but you should still check it out.
[93:55.90]Um...
[94:01.64]Wait, Buster's a dog and he's in a cage in the first area of the game you ignored.
[94:07.52]Really?
[94:11.76]Should I go back to the first area?
[94:20.53]Or was that all just for nothing?
[94:29.09]Save dog.
[94:30.83]In the main, like the first zone?
[94:35.27]I'll save the dog.
[94:35.95]We'll go back and get the dog.
[94:37.60]Just gonna make sure I'm going the right way.
[94:41.64]This game is esports ready.
[94:42.86]Yes, it is.
[94:45.12]The game is saved.
[94:45.72]Whatever.
[94:46.24]Let's just go figure this out.
[94:54.84]No, don't!
[94:55.66]Like, honest to God.
[94:57.96]Going downstairs in this game is like sliding on ice.
[95:01.73]I promise.
[95:11.89]Like, right now I'm on ice.
[95:13.02]I'm not pressing any buttons.
[95:14.00]It's just like, I feel like I'm playing Yoshi's Island.
[95:22.23]Do I play any games off stream, or is this usually how I spend my time playing games?
[95:29.14]It depends on what game it is.
[95:35.70]Like, I'll play, for instance... Like, Shadow of War is a game that I'll probably continue to play off stream.
[95:43.88]And that's not because I don't want to stream it, it's just because I kind of...
[95:48.99]I don't know.
[95:49.71]There's only so much, like, a game that I would want to play, like, on stream, like, more than, like, a couple weeks, so more than, like, three, four, five streams in a row I think is a little, um, a little on the much side for, at least for this stream.
[96:07.35]Uh, alright, so where, where's the, where's the dog?
[96:10.49]In one of these areas down here?
[96:11.55]I mean, I, I guess I can come down here, there's free shit.
[96:27.01]Come on.
[96:30.49]Stuck!
[96:31.05]Stuck!
[96:31.75]Stuck!
[96:32.13]Ah!
[96:32.51]Oh my god, please.
[96:32.99]Is he not dead?
[96:53.99]Dead, right?
[96:55.23]Dead?
[96:58.24]Hope so.
[97:03.48]Okay.
[97:04.24]So all that did is... We just completely did absolutely nothing in this whole room.
[97:11.63]It's alright, though.
[97:14.21]I just lost items.
[97:15.85]That's all that happened.
[97:22.40]Stake him when he's in the coffin.
[97:24.35]Yeah, that's true.
[97:28.63]Wooden stake.
[97:30.19]Revolver bullets.
[97:33.95]I don't have a switch, and I'm sad because Mario Odyssey... Alright, so this is... Is this Buster?
[97:39.41]What do you mean?
[97:40.15]Where's this cage?
[97:49.80]Because I don't think I can go anywhere.
[97:58.15]Let's drop this.
[98:02.55]A door across the bridge?
[98:03.65]You almost went down with grandma.
[98:08.16]Interesting.
[98:13.14]Let me just collect all this stuff.
[98:15.76]I didn't get it before.
[98:16.52]I might as well get it now.
[98:19.63]And by that I mean I'm not going to do that.
[98:22.69]We're going to leave.
[98:24.03]Why would I take unnecessary damage?
[98:25.49]There's no reason for that.
[98:30.23]I still don't have this key.
[98:32.79]I have this one, but no, we're not doing this.
[98:40.29]That would just be a mistake.
[98:41.93]I'm not going to make any mistakes today.
[98:45.13]Not today.
[98:45.57]Alright, so back... You're talking about where Grandma was hanging.
[98:52.88]Is that what you mean?
[98:59.94]Did I miss anything else?
[99:01.32]No.
[99:12.61]Grandma was hanging?
[99:13.53]Yes, Grandma was hanging.
[99:19.33]Across the... I'm trying to remember where, like, the bridge was.
[99:21.51]The bridge.
[99:31.39]Wait, you're talking about not in here?
[99:34.62]You're talking about back outside?
[99:46.04]Like in here.
[99:54.79]Found it!
[100:04.25]That guy had a gun, too.
[100:05.11]Alright, good.
[100:05.61]We're fine.
[100:06.55]We're good.
[100:08.67]Give me that.
[100:09.59]Flintlock gun.
[100:10.45]Flintlock gun.
[100:13.43]Ooh.
[100:17.65]So, yeah.
[100:18.77]Everyone was yelling at me to go... Ah!
[100:33.99]I know, they were gonna cook Roger.
[100:35.51]I think there's something might be wrong with Roger.
[100:45.54]Fucking Scooby Doo.
[100:52.82]He's like, right, right, yeah, ready to go for an adventure, Roger.
[100:58.65]Right, love you.
[101:06.58]Time to return him to the store.
[101:07.91]Does he have his own box?
[101:26.29]What?
[101:27.57]Buster will follow you and protect you with his life.
[101:32.09]Oh, no!
[101:33.17]He's... Oh, we have a dog companion.
[101:35.49]But he'll die!
[101:36.29]I don't want him to die.
[101:37.15]He can't die.
[101:37.73]I have to save Scum the whole rest of the game.
[101:44.81]He can't die.
[101:47.11]Oh, no.
[101:47.67]You're giving me more obligations and responsibilities that I didn't want to begin with.
[101:53.98]Okay.
[101:55.20]Well.
[101:57.02]Now I'm trying to think of where the hell I'm supposed to even go.
[102:02.59]Yeah, uh... Roger, you've got your head stuck in a wall.
[102:05.72]I can't help you.
[102:12.04]Bring him to... Oh, that's... Yeah, I'm gonna bring him to the doghouse.
[102:14.00]That's a good idea.
[102:16.42]Smart.
[102:16.82]Very smart.
[102:17.52]Smart move, Jet.
[102:19.54]Smart move, Jet.
[102:21.21]Smart move, Jet.
[102:21.93]Does he do something here?
[102:26.41]Look!
[102:28.89]This is your stuff.
[102:36.09]So, look, I gotta stay in... Where do I have the keys?
[102:40.91]East tower, east wing entry.
[102:42.59]I don't have... I got to the top of that tower.
[102:46.69]Where else am I supposed to go?
[102:47.63]I'm not sure.
[103:01.15]If he dies, he respawns at the doghouse.
[103:03.51]Oh, that's cool.
[103:05.15]Well, good to know.
[103:11.71]I have so many people to save.
[103:13.09]I know.
[103:13.61]Look at this.
[103:14.83]Aunt Sophie, Buster, the Kingston's.
[103:17.05]I already lost a guy.
[103:17.91]Like, this is... This game's... This is good.
[103:21.07]This is really good.
[103:26.69]This is classic, if I would say.
[103:28.78]This is a classic scary...
[103:32.05]but interesting video game.
[103:40.03]Oh, no.
[103:40.89]Well, let's see.
[103:41.57]Is Buster smarter than an old woman?
[103:47.85]I really hope he doesn't do the thing that all the NPCs do.
[103:50.91]You got it.
[103:51.32]Keep going.
[103:52.82]You're doing good so far.
[103:55.60]Now it's time to play.
[103:56.54]I'm Jeff Foxworthy.
[103:58.12]Aren't you smarter than a fifth grader?
[104:02.76]Who was the 13th president of the United States of America?
[104:10.46]That's just wrong.
[104:15.59]Don't move, Buster.
[104:16.25]Don't move.
[104:24.23]He's smart.
[104:27.79]That was too loud.
[104:28.59]I'm sorry, that was loud.
[104:33.06]Okay.
[104:36.80]Yeah, I don't want to be like a loud guy.
[104:38.86]I'm sorry.
[104:40.14]I apologize.
[104:52.05]Leave him at the doghouse.
[104:56.07]I don't think I can leave him at the doghouse.
[105:05.15]He's very cautious, though, that I will... I was about to say, shit, he's going back down.
[105:08.85]Alright, where... Come around this way.
[105:16.71]Let's examine while there's nobody here.
[105:21.59]Too many places for him to fall down.
[105:24.10]Honestly.
[105:28.70]And when you do, like, a burst of speed like that, man, you make me really nervous.
[105:41.05]Well, I don't think you can go this way Kenny Wow Dog has been confirmed as way better than any human being for sure.
[106:03.11]Oh
[106:06.69]What a good boy.
[106:08.33]Best character in the game.
[106:09.83]By far.
[106:15.29]He found a problem.
[106:16.85]And he came up with a solution.
[106:20.34]Alright, so.
[106:22.04]Down here, right?
[106:24.46]This is where I ended up before.
[106:27.24]Where is the... Down here.
[106:31.02]Keep going.
[106:34.20]God, I hit the wrong button.
[106:41.00]Can he make it down here?
[106:49.11]You're so smart.
[106:50.23]Good job.
[106:51.77]I love his little jump that he does when he can't figure out the path.
[106:54.95]He just goes like, spring, spring, spring.
[107:03.07]Of course, why wouldn't I take five damage?
[107:05.19]I don't even care.
[107:09.57]Alright, now I'm looking for a door.
[107:13.08]There's a door.
[107:14.84]Is this a door?
[107:16.56]This is a door.
[107:17.92]This is a trap door.
[107:21.46]Let's continue.
[107:22.18]Alright, he almost just fell through the whole thing.
[107:34.15]Be careful, be careful, be careful.
[107:35.49]This is a weird, like, glitchy physics area.
[107:45.77]Is he opening this door?
[107:51.07]Why?
[107:51.73]Why?
[107:52.25]Why?
[107:56.46]Can he make it?
[108:00.68]I think he's telling me he's stuck.
[108:02.60]Medium health pack.
[108:04.74]Ammo.
[108:06.28]Lots of chests.
[108:08.19]More ammo.
[108:10.95]Health.
[108:12.67]And health.
[108:13.13]God.
[108:17.24]Come on, you can make it.
[108:23.53]It's not even here.
[108:24.25]Come on, where are you?
[108:30.51]Come on!
[108:35.63]I know you can make it.
[108:36.51]I'm certain of it.
[108:45.69]Maybe if I go far enough away?
[108:50.42]This is his briefing room.
[108:58.26]Is he still just sitting there?
[109:01.19]Alright, come on, man.
[109:03.49]You gotta learn how to take the... I'm gonna wait till we're close, then I'm gonna jump.
[109:09.31]Okay.
[109:12.71]Now we're both stuck.
[109:22.30]Come on.
[109:26.20]Go.
[109:28.08]Get down there.
[109:28.87]Alright, you made it.
[109:32.15]Good.
[109:32.63]Get down.
[109:39.97]Success.
[109:41.93]We both did it.
[109:42.67]Congratulations.
[109:44.07]Game save.
[109:47.44]How much longer on the stream?
[109:49.04]Oh, I don't know, maybe like another... Once I start to get to the end of the... I got 30 minutes.
[109:57.00]30 minutes.
[109:58.38]I have to beat this game in 30 minutes.
[110:00.33]It's not gonna happen.
[110:00.85]But we're gonna try.
[110:02.27]Alright, let's go.
[110:05.73]Let's see what he's capable of!
[110:09.69]You wanna talk about it like a knee-jerk reaction?
[110:12.24]Beautiful headshot.
[110:15.95]Thank you.
[110:17.37]I will accept the award.
[110:29.98]We are a team.
[110:35.02]He stunlocks him and I take him.
[110:43.65]I'm gonna accidentally shoot this dog in the head.
[110:46.85]You are so much better at the game than I am.
[110:52.62]Where?
[110:53.30]Where is he?
[110:56.92]Oh, it's this thing.
[110:57.82]Cleanse it.
[111:06.27]This flintlock pistol is really good, though.
[111:07.79]Let's get both of these.
[111:11.41]How did I even open that?
[111:21.63]Another good shot.
[111:24.44]What if I shoot the portal?
[111:29.02]What happens if I shoot the portal?
[111:33.60]Nothing.
[111:37.50]What's going on?
[111:40.52]Where did the dog go?
[111:42.72]Did the dog just try to... The dog just tried to open the door.
[111:56.09]We need it.
[111:56.81]We need a key to get in there We don't have that key yet.
[112:02.20]I know you're very smart, but we need to go back this way He's just he's playing the game without me military life uncle Andrew I
[112:20.97]The dog doesn't need me to finish the game.
[112:22.69]He's like, fuck this guy.
[112:24.27]I saw a vampiric succubus capture Greg and take him higher up in the east tower.
[112:28.83]You must find him.
[112:30.21]Have you found Doctor... Yes, I have.
[112:34.60]You must succeed to be slain.
[112:35.68]Aunt Emily and I have a revolver in our trunk at the main entrance.
[112:38.16]Take me there and I'll get... Where is this guy?
[112:49.82]Um... Uncle Andrew.
[112:53.38]Are you even in this... Is he talking to me?
[112:56.30]I don't understand.
[112:59.52]The rabid canine devil dogs have pitch black fur and gleaming eyes.
[113:03.00]Yeah.
[113:06.02]I know.
[113:06.56]I've fought... I've played against them.
[113:13.07]I gotta stop using the flintlock pistol.
[113:14.75]It's a one-hit kill.
[113:16.27]I'm gonna start using the shitty revolver to get rid of the bolts.
[113:20.53]Uh, encyclopedia.
[113:22.75]Ancient rare vampire.
[113:23.79]I've already beat him.
[113:25.03]He was easy.
[113:29.68]There he is.
[113:33.46]Does he follow me now?
[113:36.06]So here's this guy.
[113:37.60]Briefing room.
[113:39.76]So we gotta get you back.
[113:41.22]Alright, let's take him back.
[113:43.85]What if I just don't take him back?
[113:45.83]Will he fight with me and stay with me the whole time?
[113:47.51]We don't have very much time.
[113:50.87]You know what I'm saying?
[113:53.35]Look, this guy doesn't give me anything.
[113:54.99]Like, I'm using the revolver he told me about.
[113:57.01]So if he dies, he dies.
[113:57.85]I don't care.
[114:00.15]So, why don't we just try to get as many people as we can?
[114:02.11]Because we have 30... We have like 27 minutes.
[114:11.94]I want to go back this way.
[114:22.03]Alright, uh... Let's go get him again.
[114:48.21]Everything's safe.
[114:48.93]Watch out for the monster right here.
[114:50.57]No, he's not there.
[114:51.51]Still don't have a garrison.
[115:05.27]I'm not going to be able to get this dude this in time.
[115:09.24]Oh.
[115:11.98]Wait a minute.
[115:12.58]I can't get them back in the hole.
[115:15.54]Can I?
[115:16.66]I think I can.
[115:18.51]Stop doing that shit.
[115:20.27]I think we can get back in that hole.
[115:23.89]We're not going in here.
[115:24.43]We're not going in here.
[115:26.73]We're not going in here.
[115:27.33]Back up this way.
[115:27.81]Back, back, back.
[115:28.49]Come on.
[115:28.81]Come on.
[115:31.36]Both of you in the hole.
[115:34.88]In the hole.
[115:39.58]Both of you.
[115:40.28]Follow me.
[115:42.54]Look, we can like bloody trap land this and just jump on each other.
[115:45.20]Okay, I'm in.
[115:46.62]God damn it.
[115:50.41]What?
[115:50.65]Who died?
[115:51.11]Who died?
[115:52.91]Somebody died?
[115:53.43]Did I just kill somebody?
[115:54.81]What happened?
[115:55.63]Hold on, doctor... Get out of the fucking way.
[116:06.82]Somebody died.
[116:07.64]Alright, get in.
[116:14.78]Come on.
[116:17.52]If you're sure about this, old man, I'll wait here.
[116:25.06]No, don't wait here.
[116:26.76]Get up here.
[116:30.56]They can't do it.
[116:42.86]You go first, old chap, and I'll watch your back.
[116:46.77]We have to take him this way.
[116:48.15]What is that noise?
[116:55.89]Save the doctor?
[116:56.37]I don't even know where the doctor is.
[117:00.05]Down there.
[117:01.23]What's in here?
[117:01.75]What's in here?
[117:02.21]What's in here?
[117:02.64]What's this stuff?
[117:04.64]The dog is freaking out right now.
[117:05.98]I don't know.
[117:06.84]Oh god, other dogs.
[117:07.86]Mean dogs.
[117:09.58]I'm ready.
[117:09.86]He's dead.
[117:17.32]I don't think I can save the doctor.
[117:18.57]Fuck.
[117:20.07]Bad guy?
[117:49.11]Vampire bats.
[117:51.05]Scary.
[117:56.87]Wait, what do you mean he's in the room?
[117:58.13]Wait, wait, wait, what?
[117:58.91]I have to go quick?
[118:03.55]You go first, old chap, and I'll watch your back.
[118:06.33]Okay, let's go.
[118:06.73]I'm going.
[118:08.28]Where is he?
[118:11.10]Thank God you're here, James.
[118:13.18]Get us out of here, James.
[118:26.53]Okay!
[118:29.19]I got- okay dude, like three is a company.
[118:31.35]Four is a crowd.
[118:32.53]Honestly.
[118:33.81]There's too many of us here.
[118:36.99]You think I'm gonna be able to protect three different people?
[118:43.67]It was already a pain in the ass.
[118:45.92]You just made it even worse.
[118:53.85]This is an extra three people that I have to beat.
[118:57.73]Okay.
[118:58.59]Think about how many times I have to get these guys to walk down a ledge and they're gonna fall.
[119:02.46]It's gonna be terrible.
[119:06.68]Save it.
[119:07.02]We're gonna be doing a lot of save scumming.
[119:09.66]Real quick.
[119:12.00]Yeah, I got the almanac.
[119:12.86]I got the father's undead almanac.
[119:14.74]That's fine.
[119:18.56]Right through these doors.
[119:26.40]Alright.
[119:27.62]How do we get out of here?
[119:32.11]Not that way.
[119:33.15]We lost the dog.
[119:35.59]Where's the dog?
[119:38.15]This dog is like doing strategy with the maps.
[119:40.95]Like, let's go.
[119:41.35]Come on.
[119:42.75]We don't have time for this.
[119:43.47]Come on.
[119:43.85]Move.
[119:47.49]That dog was planning his next attack.
[119:49.21]What are you playing?
[119:49.73]Starcraft?
[119:50.37]Like, let's go.
[119:55.65]We're already in here, but I will take the health.
[119:58.97]Save it.
[120:01.07]Somebody just pushed him.
[120:02.31]No pushing!
[120:03.83]Don't push each other, we're all gonna get there.
[120:07.75]No reason for it.
[120:18.46]More dogs.
[120:20.86]Apparently I missed.
[120:25.19]Another one.
[120:27.37]Alright, keep going.
[120:30.97]What's over here?
[120:31.81]Free stuff.
[120:36.35]What?!
[120:37.49]How did that not hit him?
[120:40.63]I'm gonna have to play the game.
[120:43.98]The dog is way better than anything I could do.
[120:46.48]I just want to make sure I don't miss any items.
[120:53.85]These guys can't fucking handle themselves.
[120:58.97]Where did they go?
[120:59.43]Get us out of here, James.
[121:07.86]Who is in trouble?
[121:09.28]Oh, God, it's you.
[121:16.51]I'm not dealing with it.
[121:17.57]We're just going right in the front door.
[121:18.59]Get us out of here, James.
[121:23.79]God, you stupid asshole.
[121:25.23]Come on.
[121:29.78]You go first, old chap, and I'll watch your back.
[121:33.10]That's true.
[121:33.82]Alright.
[121:34.62]Just... Be careful.
[121:37.22]Just kick up the dogs.
[121:41.09]That's alright.
[121:42.01]Make sure we got three.
[121:43.15]We gotta go in the green door.
[121:46.49]Green door.
[121:47.79]Watch out for the spawning.
[121:49.83]Here we are.
[121:51.75]We're gonna go ahead and we're gonna save this game.
[121:53.53]I would have laughed if he died from that fall.
[122:00.30]Be easy.
[122:02.70]Dog.
[122:04.66]Come on.
[122:06.06]Let's go.
[122:09.38]The dog sometimes just doesn't follow.
[122:12.19]Just like a real dog.
[122:12.99]Alright, be careful up here.
[122:22.76]Gonna go up the stairs?
[122:23.42]He's doing all the work.
[122:32.61]Okay, here's what's happening right now.
[122:47.48]I'm also an NPC.
[122:49.54]The dog is the player, and I'm the useless- one of the three useless people following the dog.
[122:55.76]I've just figured it out.
[122:58.78]Be careful on these stairs.
[123:07.35]What was that, like, Tony Hawk pro skater move?
[123:11.15]Don't even need it, but I'm gonna take it.
[123:12.33]Who cares?
[123:12.79]Like, I just did, like, an ollie.
[123:23.43]So far so good, old chap!
[123:28.97]We can go, we gotta go here.
[123:31.31]Nope, they're gonna keep pouring out of that.
[123:36.29]That's how these things work.
[123:41.62]I'm just gonna be true with my bow.
[123:45.28]Almost shot the dog in the head.
[123:55.24]Okay, that's it.
[123:59.06]This game is terrifying.
[124:03.70]I'm terrified of this game.
[124:04.93]I really am.
[124:08.55]Garrison 1.
[124:11.03]Oh boy.
[124:11.47]Oh boy.
[124:17.69]Whoa!
[124:17.89]Save us, dog!
[124:24.30]The dog's name is James.
[124:30.36]Get us out of here, Buster.
[124:33.18]Save us.
[124:38.30]Alright, there's another... No, don't go in here.
[124:40.94]Let's go.
[124:44.40]Come back over here.
[124:49.00]We're gonna have another Wizard of Oz joke here in a minute.
[125:00.62]This is the next room.
[125:04.19]Looking for another person.
[125:07.19]Save it.
[125:12.21]Oh shit!
[125:16.38]Move, we're fine.
[125:25.82]Where's my troop?
[125:26.53]Come on guys.
[125:38.40]Where'd they go?
[125:44.21]Where the fuck are you guys?
[125:44.95]What happened?
[126:03.40]Well?
[126:05.90]Oh, okay.
[126:14.79]Don't leave.
[126:15.29]Don't leave.
[126:15.71]Don't leave.
[126:16.41]Get over here.
[126:20.75]Why is just a professor coming?
[126:22.11]Come on.
[126:24.59]Alright, save it again so that doesn't happen.
[126:33.78]This game... I like this game.
[126:35.46]This game is very fun.
[126:36.60]It's very intriguing.
[126:37.58]It's very interesting.
[126:39.54]We gotta get over to the green door.
[126:43.38]I know what happened to them.
[126:44.04]I think they got stuck in the wall over there.
[126:45.30]Alright, let's go this way.
[126:47.17]Watch out for mutants.
[126:49.97]Got a lot of things to open.
[127:01.70]Health.
[127:02.04]That was a large health pack.
[127:05.66]Wooden stake.
[127:06.34]No.
[127:13.36]What do you mean wait?
[127:14.78]No, don't wait.
[127:15.98]And where's the dog?
[127:17.86]Come on, all of you.
[127:22.18]Is everybody alive?
[127:23.97]Okay.
[127:44.39]Good.
[127:48.41]Please follow me.
[127:53.43]That guy was just jumping up and down and now he's gone.
[127:57.27]Where are you people going?
[127:58.27]They can't handle the fact that there's... They can't handle... They can't handle the fucking picnic tables.
[128:05.39]You idiots.
[128:06.77]Just go over the picnic tables.
[128:08.23]Get over here.
[128:08.65]The fucking old professor finally figured it out.
[128:13.48]Come on.
[128:15.99]Yes.
[128:16.55]Stay right here.
[128:18.05]You!
[128:18.63]Dog!
[128:19.51]You!
[128:20.17]Wait.
[128:21.17]Both of you wait.
[128:23.15]Come.
[128:28.05]Come on.
[128:31.41]Come on.
[128:31.67]Stop jumping.
[128:33.03]I gotta get them out of here.
[128:34.09]I have to get them out of here.
[128:34.97]Come on.
[128:35.33]Out.
[128:43.72]Save it.
[128:44.78]Everyone's alive.
[128:46.62]We're all in bad health.
[128:52.61]I have 20 minutes to beat the game.
[128:55.51]That ain't gonna fucking happen.
[129:02.10]Watch it.
[129:02.74]Where are they coming from?
[129:04.32]Behind us?
[129:10.89]I've hit the reload button like a fucking dumb shithead.
[129:18.37]No, come down.
[129:19.27]Right?
[129:20.53]No, the dog's going this way.
[129:21.83]We're gonna follow the dog.
[129:24.67]The dog just prevented a jump scare.
[129:28.59]The dog could see through the jump scare.
[129:30.22]That's good.
[129:30.94]I'm glad.
[129:33.76]No garrison.
[129:43.25]Dog!
[129:44.47]Dog!
[129:45.71]Dog!
[129:53.76]God!
[129:59.21]Stop him.
[129:59.69]Oh my lord.
[130:03.81]I've already fucking been in here.
[130:04.99]Oh, I'm stuck.
[130:17.05]Alright, get out of the way.
[130:19.33]So we have to go down.
[130:24.69]Down we go.
[130:26.47]Save here.
[130:26.97]I just went in a circle, but I was following the green light.
[130:33.41]There was no more green lights.
[130:40.69]I'm going to give my dog the gun and say, please beat the game for me.
[130:43.81]There we go.
[130:44.12]Here's another green light.
[130:45.74]Found it.
[130:48.52]Got everybody?
[130:49.72]Yes we do.
[130:51.52]Oh god.
[130:57.12]Almost dead.
[130:57.42]I think there's a lot- Is that gonna happen a third time?
[131:18.94]I heard maniacal laughter.
[131:20.18]I'm not okay with that.
[131:22.08]Officer core.
[131:25.98]I got one.
[131:26.40]Look, let's trade.
[131:27.06]I'm going to get one and you get one.
[131:31.80]You didn't get that one.
[131:32.58]We were supposed to trade.
[131:34.76]You go first, El Chap, and I'll watch your back.
[131:39.26]No, we need to all stick together.
[131:40.74]That's how this works.
[131:43.26]You go first, El Chap, and I'll watch.
[131:51.58]This is just... This is babysit the stupid NPCs, the video game.
[132:06.99]Now we have to guess a room.
[132:12.34]Guess what door the next person's in.
[132:17.56]Oh, okay.
[132:18.64]I'll wait right here.
[132:23.70]Who's waiting right here?
[132:29.12]Where... Where did he go?
[132:31.62]Did I lose another person?
[132:32.76]Did I lose him?
[132:33.48]Because he's not here.
[132:35.58]He's hiding like behind a bookcase.
[132:37.04]Oh my god.
[132:37.68]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[132:41.70]Where is he?
[132:43.33]Where is he?
[132:54.97]Where and what?
[132:56.37]I went through the floorboards and that apparently ends the game.
[133:02.47]Well, I'm okay with that because... I clipped through the ceiling and everybody died.
[133:10.47]Why are you loading me in here?
[133:13.30]Everybody shut up.
[133:14.28]I need to keep... Dude, I need to keep total eyesight.
[133:17.76]I have to have constant vision of all three of these people.
[133:23.62]Because, like, otherwise you're gonna clip through the ceiling.
[133:25.72]Like, he's gonna go.
[133:26.86]He's gonna go.
[133:31.45]Bye.
[133:32.59]Speaking of watching, I need to make sure you don't disappear.
[133:34.59]Because you're gonna clip into the ceiling like I just did.
[133:39.03]And the game is gonna end.
[133:40.01]Okay.
[133:45.24]So we've all agreed.
[133:48.34]Dog?
[133:49.42]Okay.
[133:49.86]I see.
[133:50.34]Look, now we... Now we save the game.
[133:54.07]Because all of you exist.
[133:55.95]Let's go in the next room.
[133:59.71]This one is a free full health, pretty much.
[134:01.88]No, it's not.
[134:02.50]It's small.
[134:06.74]Stakes only.
[134:10.38]We all still exist.
[134:20.90]I fucking just knee-jerk reloaded like a moron.
[134:23.34]Alright, come on.
[134:31.68]Here we go.
[134:33.96]And we only have, like, a full hallway of rooms left to do.
[134:36.96]And we have 15 minutes to beat the game.
[134:44.87]Like, that's just not gonna happen.
[134:49.11]And they're blocking the dog from getting in.
[134:52.73]Oh, you idiots.
[134:53.67]Jesus Christ.
[135:01.16]You go first, old chap, and I'll watch your back.
[135:06.04]And I just press the goddamn reload button again.
[135:08.24]Just gotta go quick through every room.
[135:19.83]Fast.
[135:31.54]Nothing?
[135:33.84]We're all still existing.
[135:34.74]Good.
[135:35.58]Goodbye.
[135:36.20]Go.
[135:36.66]Out of my way.
[135:38.16]I was about to shoot him in the head.
[135:39.52]I was.
[135:39.76]Alright.
[135:47.83]Get away from me.
[135:51.57]Wait, we already... I'm getting so turned around.
[136:00.45]There's so many ways to go!
[136:15.58]There's so many ways to go and I have too many idiots with me that won't move.
[136:21.26]I gotta get rid of them.
[136:28.94]We have 10 minutes.
[136:29.56]We're running out of time.
[136:38.48]This is it.
[136:39.00]We gotta go.
[136:40.17]I don't have any time for this.
[136:43.33]Hope you're with me.
[136:44.65]You're not.
[136:49.91]Let's go.
[136:50.11]Come on.
[136:52.47]I have to at least get like half of you rescued.
[136:55.52]Through the door!
[136:56.88]Through the door.
[136:57.40]Don't jump in front of each other.
[136:58.66]One at a time, please.
[136:59.68]Keep your hands and arms inside the vehicle.
[137:01.20]Come on.
[137:05.02]They went to go do something else.
[137:07.44]Uh, dog is gone.
[137:12.26]No, he's right here.
[137:15.82]Come on!
[137:16.76]Get through the doors, please!
[137:19.04]You guys really only have ten minutes to go find the rest of our family.
[137:28.48]One of... One of these guys is gonna have to die.
[137:31.71]I think I'm gonna have to pick who dies.
[137:36.07]Still no dog.
[137:37.77]You two stay here.
[137:39.63]Stay.
[137:40.09]Don't move.
[137:42.43]Don't move.
[137:42.97]No.
[137:43.29]Quick.
[137:43.51]Before he gets over here.
[137:44.24]Before he like... It's like the weird guy that follows me.
[137:46.72]Dog's gone.
[137:54.32]I just heard him bark.
[138:05.42]Save!
[138:14.92]What were you doing in the toilet, man?
[138:17.52]No, don't get stuck in here.
[138:19.67]Of all the places.
[138:20.91]Okay, here we go.
[138:24.93]Key to the garrison.
[138:30.51]We can now go in the... We're gonna get back there in ten minutes.
[138:34.86]You think we're gonna be able to get back to the garrison door in 10 minutes?
[138:38.88]Are you kidding me?
[138:39.56]Okay, I'm gonna have to make some jokes to add some time.
[138:57.12]Green door.
[138:57.94]Green?
[138:58.56]None of these doors are green.
[139:03.94]One, two, three, go!
[139:12.02]Garrison.
[139:16.82]Just keep the dog and ignore everyone else.
[139:23.67]Health.
[139:24.07]Save.
[139:35.45]10 minutes.
[139:37.77]I'm trying to concentrate.
[139:38.91]I'm trying to figure out the correct route.
[139:41.40]This is a bedroom.
[139:48.98]Come on.
[139:51.74]Just get me out of here.
[139:55.43]Yeah, I gotta run.
[139:56.77]I just have to get as many people back as I can.
[139:59.33]So I'm going to try to save these three and that's it.
[140:02.09]Whatever happens, happens.
[140:02.83]That's the end of the game.
[140:10.69]It's a garrison.
[140:14.71]I'm gonna die.
[140:16.81]Is that it?
[140:19.65]Get him, dog.
[140:20.23]Dog, please.
[140:20.59]Dog!
[140:20.81]Nice work.
[140:22.05]Done?
[140:22.21]There's the ga-
[140:41.85]How much time do I got?
[140:50.42]I don't know where I'm going.
[140:55.68]I'm lost.
[141:01.01]Right now, I'm just shooting.
[141:02.31]I'm dead.
[141:02.97]Oh, fuck you.
[141:10.57]What am I meant to be doing?
[141:11.45]I'm trying to get these- these people to- Speaking of people.
[141:19.71]Oh my lord.
[141:22.16]Okay.
[141:29.20]Not going in that room.
[141:31.92]We're just trying to get everybody to- The dog went somewhere else.
[141:35.45]The dog is playing a different game.
[141:41.87]No, no, no.
[141:43.25]You're not going to be able to get in that way.
[141:45.71]Just forget about it.
[141:47.25]Forget about it.
[141:48.23]It's not worth it.
[141:49.87]It's not worth it.
[141:51.27]We only have seven minutes.
[141:58.38]Finally.
[142:00.12]Forget.
[142:00.36]He's going to go in this door.
[142:03.02]Come on.
[142:05.10]Keep moving.
[142:05.76]All three of you.
[142:07.20]I'm gonna have to put him down.
[142:09.51]That's terrible.
[142:12.37]Ah, shit.
[142:13.97]Wait.
[142:16.49]Wait.
[142:16.99]Hold on.
[142:18.27]I've been here before.
[142:26.45]Where is this?
[142:27.19]Oh, God.
[142:27.61]Where is this?
[142:28.13]This is... Okay.
[142:29.55]Okay.
[142:29.81]Hold on.
[142:30.05]Wait, wait, wait.
[142:31.07]This is where we found the lady.
[142:34.42]Dog?
[142:37.52]Don't.
[142:38.00]Please don't.
[142:38.56]Okay, we're almost there.
[142:39.80]Don't move.
[142:41.10]Our dog is gone.
[142:51.35]We lost the dog.
[142:53.09]Let's go.
[142:55.85]We lost the dog.
[142:57.01]That's okay.
[142:57.59]That's fine.
[142:58.03]Sometimes you lose.
[142:59.15]Sometimes he's fighting.
[142:59.97]He's playing his own game.
[143:00.67]Come on.
[143:01.25]Down, down, down, down.
[143:01.79]We gotta go.
[143:03.49]Quickly.
[143:04.03]With the swiftness now.
[143:07.28]Whip this, whip this.
[143:07.88]Both of you.
[143:09.08]Keep going.
[143:12.90]Oh, you fucking stupid game.
[143:18.74]We're almost there.
[143:19.24]I almost have both of you home.
[143:21.33]Which door is it?
[143:22.85]I don't remember.
[143:23.43]Not this one.
[143:25.65]I don't remember.
[143:27.09]I actually don't remember which one it is.
[143:32.03]Which one?
[143:32.51]How do I get out of here?
[143:33.69]Where's the bottom of the...
[143:36.98]Okay, this is the rock.
[143:38.95]This way.
[143:47.05]Oh, I'm so lost right now.
[143:48.37]It's down here somewhere.
[143:54.32]It's not over there.
[143:55.10]I know that for a fact.
[143:55.88]It's over here.
[143:59.40]Okay, I gotta save the game.
[144:03.10]I got plenty of shots.
[144:07.03]Dog, the dog's gonna be fine.
[144:09.02]He's gonna get up.
[144:12.38]Aye yi yi.
[144:13.00]Okay, we're almost there.
[144:18.56]Come on!
[144:19.22]Come on!
[144:22.38]Home free.
[144:24.00]With five minutes to spare.
[144:34.05]Good, good, good, good.
[144:35.31]Okay.
[144:41.21]Come on in.
[144:41.73]Revolver from the truck.
[144:46.10]Get in here.
[144:46.94]Oh, this guy heals.
[144:47.62]Okay, heal.
[144:47.88]That's 100% health.
[144:48.72]Okay.
[144:48.84]Alright, what else do I... What do I gotta do now?
[144:50.36]Go back for the dog.
[144:51.34]I have to go back there anyways.
[144:52.60]I got five minutes to go get the dog.
[145:11.76]Okay, you guys ready?
[145:13.88]Five minutes.
[145:21.26]I'll get him.
[145:21.58]I ain't leaving my dog behind.
[145:26.57]Wait, it's a different revolver?
[145:34.49]Shit!
[145:35.29]It's like, doctor, heal me.
[145:39.73]And he heals.
[145:44.01]Here's a little something for that wound.
[145:45.59]It's not the se- it's the se- I haven't- Ah, you- You lied to me!
[145:53.48]It's the- Four minutes to go save Otto.
[146:02.66]I'm not leaving my dog behind.
[146:06.03]I just- I had two imbeciles with me, and the dog is fine.
[146:08.91]We all know the dog is playing the game better than I am.
[146:12.01]He's gonna be fine.
[146:17.88]Dog is not dead.
[146:23.24]He's up here.
[146:25.48]And we go this way.
[146:26.20]And we don't.
[146:28.50]We go over here.
[146:29.06]We go up the stairs and we go through the door.
[146:31.08]Yep.
[146:31.38]Okay.
[146:31.92]We're good.
[146:38.07]We're gonna get the dog ending.
[146:39.31]I don't care about the good or bad ending.
[146:40.59]How many people have I saved?
[146:42.23]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[146:44.99]I count the priest, even though he's dead.
[146:46.67]I don't care.
[146:48.84]I don't have time to look at this.
[146:49.82]I gotta save the dog.
[146:56.29]And then... Got him!
[146:59.67]You thought I was gonna leave the dog behind, didn't you?
[147:03.74]Didn't.
[147:05.82]Let's go.
[147:06.34]Can we get one more person?
[147:10.62]Come on!
[147:14.60]There's one more potential save we can get.
[147:16.54]I don't know which way.
[147:18.08]Am I going the wrong way?
[147:24.46]Where are you?
[147:24.86]I don't want to lose him again.
[147:30.34]He's so obsessed with over here.
[147:33.71]Get over here.
[147:41.41]Okay, the guy on the ceiling is what the dog was looking at.
[147:44.92]Look, you need to listen to me.
[147:48.34]Let's go.
[147:51.48]Two minutes?
[147:53.92]Let's go.
[147:54.22]Go.
[147:54.44]Out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out, out.
[147:57.46]Out.
[147:59.29]Out.
[147:59.65]Come on.
[148:02.67]Get.
[148:03.37]Come on, dog.
[148:03.87]We gotta go.
[148:04.63]We gotta go right now.
[148:06.01]We only have one minute.
[148:07.35]I know.
[148:07.69]Yes, I'll give you a nice treat when we get back to the house.
[148:09.55]Come on.
[148:11.83]I'll take damage here.
[148:14.23]I don't mind taking damage, a little bit of damage.
[148:15.91]We'll uh, just gotta get all the way down.
[148:19.46]One minute!
[148:21.88]Come on, come on, come on, come on!
[148:24.32]We're almost out, that's a different room!
[148:28.94]I'm almost saved us all!
[148:31.28]Wrong door!
[148:35.71]Alright, 20 seconds, no, 40 seconds, we're okay.
[148:39.57]We're gonna get out with the dog, we're gonna go meet up with everybody in front of the church.
[148:42.99]Oh shit.
[148:49.43]Come on.
[148:51.08]Come on.
[148:52.40]I gotta get over to the dune buggy.
[148:56.90]The clock is gonna strike midnight.
[148:58.62]And then we're all gonna turn into pumpkins.
[149:01.68]Ugh!
[149:04.06]Alright, I made it.
[149:06.54]Alright, we're ten seconds to spare.
[149:22.33]Just kidding.
[149:22.93]I'm kidding.
[149:23.35]I'm kidding.
[149:24.21]I'm kidding.
[149:24.77]I'm kidding Let's go come on Buster Come on this Come on Come on five four three two one.
[149:39.88]It's midnight Oh
[149:52.27]Uh, the game's still going.
[149:57.82]The game's not even over.
[149:59.75]Uh, I... Huh?
[150:20.58]Difficulty just gets way harder at midnight.
[150:22.46]Oh.
[150:24.24]Alright, well, you stay here.
[150:32.36]Okay.
[150:33.90]That was going to be the end of the stream.
[150:37.92]I don't deserve the dog.
[150:39.14]Come on, it wasn't even real.
[150:41.86]I have, like, the click remote.
[150:43.10]I can just rewind after I punch my boss in the face.
[150:54.01]This game is fucking amazing.
[150:55.71]Yeah, let's go over this real quick.
[150:59.32]This game is very, very good.
[151:02.84]This was way before its time.
[151:04.38]This game is great.
[151:14.55]I think the dog just keeps following me.
[151:18.05]He really did meet Adam Sandler.
[151:21.15]No, that is actually where I'm going to end the stream.
[151:27.62]We're going for like four and a half hours now.
[151:30.30]We're going to be live tomorrow again.
[151:31.56]Don't you worry.
[151:36.78]Really?
[151:37.02]You went for the click reference?
[151:38.22]Yeah, I did.
[151:42.55]Don't stop streaming until next month.
[151:47.23]Yeah, I'm going to save it.
[151:48.85]Game is saved.
[151:50.35]Well, it doesn't even matter.
[151:50.99]It's saved right there anyway.
[151:54.09]I might actually play this again tomorrow.
[152:00.05]Yeah, I've not read any bits, so I'm gonna spend some time doing that.
[152:06.72]This was a lot of fun, though.
[152:08.52]I had fun tonight.
[152:10.38]Especially with this game.
[152:11.72]We were in this one particularly for like almost, what, two hours?
[152:14.94]Two and a half hours?
[152:16.22]I did not expect that.
[152:19.76]At all.
[152:24.81]But yeah, we'll be live tomorrow.
[152:26.91]We're also gonna be live on Saturday, so we're doing like four days in a row.
[152:31.98]Would you guys actually want to see this again?
[152:34.62]Would you like to see it again?
[152:38.60]Because after tomorrow, we might just go back to this after the... The game is on Steam.
[152:44.53]Is it on Steam right now?
[152:48.23]Because I think... Where did I get this from?
[152:49.65]Let's see.
[152:53.46]Yeah.
[152:53.68]Guys, this game is $1 on Steam.
[152:54.96]It's $1 fucking dollar.
[153:01.89]Please just go buy this game.
[153:03.32]Just go get it.
[153:04.18]Why would you not go get this game?
[153:06.30]For $1.
[153:06.64]On Steam.
[153:11.70]Like, holy shit.
[153:13.82]Please go buy this.
[153:15.50]It's normally $10.
[153:16.62]It's 90% off until after Halloween.
[153:19.98]You have until the 1st of November to spend $1.
[153:21.72]On a fun video game, for sure.
[153:32.20]Sponsored stream revealed.
[153:34.94]No, but, like... You can't argue the fact that, like, for your time... Like, you can do that, like, a bunch of different ways.
[153:43.49]You could, like, try to speedrun this game.
[153:44.97]This game has a lot of potential to be really, really cool.
[153:49.39]Way before its time.
[153:50.47]This game came out in 2003.
[153:52.61]Like, think about that.
[153:54.68]That's insane.
[153:58.96]If you order now, it's only a dollar.
[154:00.12]Yeah.
[154:01.60]That was very fun.
[154:03.00]Depending on... Because I still have... How many more games do I have?
[154:06.34]Let me see.
[154:06.84]Let me just figure this out.
[154:09.87]I have... Let's see.
[154:15.03]Let me switch this.
[154:19.17]I have... One, two, three...
[154:29.23]I have four games left to play that we have not played yet.
[154:39.12]The only other game this company made was Drake and the 99 Dragons.
[154:44.63]That's extraordinarily specific and odd.
[154:47.97]But I'm going to go through the bits.
[154:50.23]There's quite a lot of them.
[154:52.23]So we're going to be here for about another 10-15 minutes.
[154:56.66]I didn't check.
[154:58.24]I was just locked in.
[154:59.48]Plus my other screen gets a little screwed up when I open up some of these old 800x600 games.
[155:05.46]So let's go through these.
[155:07.34]We're going to go from back to front here.
[155:11.42]from back to front.
[155:13.10]So let's just hang out here and talk.
[155:17.30]Actually, I'm going to put the outro off for now.
[155:19.84]Let's just go.
[155:20.50]Let's just hang out with like... Ah, no.
[155:22.64]It's fine.
[155:23.12]Whatever.
[155:24.02]Turn it down.
[155:29.04]How do you go from this to Drake?
[155:30.20]I have no idea.
[155:32.10]That doesn't make any sense.
[155:34.35]So all the way from four hours ago, we're going to start there.
[155:37.97]Sorry I missed him, but we're going to go over him now.
[155:41.25]Ugh.
[155:42.39]Let me just expel some fluids.
[155:45.53]Six Renegade.
[155:46.07]Thanks for the two bucks.
[155:48.03]Last stream, I thought, who goes to the bathroom three to four times in four hours?
[155:52.61]Then today I went three times in the past four hours.
[155:55.33]It was a thrilling experience.
[155:56.47]P.S.
[155:56.79]Drink green tea, boy.
[155:58.64]Not soda.
[155:59.40]All that sugar.
[156:00.08]Ugh.
[156:02.06]P.S.S.
[156:03.56]Sour please on the intro song.
[156:07.00]What was the first game?
[156:09.96]I think that was Fantasmagoria.
[156:12.60]But look, when you sit here, the reason why I pee so much, and I don't know, maybe I'm weird.
[156:17.99]But like when I'm talking a lot, I sit here and I just talk for like five hours.
[156:25.65]So I have to sit here and I have to have something to drink.
[156:27.91]I have to constantly be wetting my throat, whether that's with a coffee or a alcoholic drink or juice or soda.
[156:39.54]I just got to have something here.
[156:42.38]So that's why I pee so often because I'm just constantly putting fluids into my body.
[156:48.36]Sometimes it's water, sometimes it's like coconut water.
[156:50.76]Depends.
[156:52.66]But yeah, thank you.
[156:53.52]Thank you, Ivory, for the two bucks.
[156:55.16]Really digging the Gregorian rat movie theme you got going on.
[156:58.99]Seems good.
[156:59.69]Well, thank you.
[157:00.73]WampyDoo, thanks for the bits.
[157:02.99]Holo1Zombie, thanks for the $5.
[157:04.93]Special hugs.
[157:06.23]Yes, we were talking about how she was getting mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and scratching his back.
[157:13.26]But thanks.
[157:13.58]Thank you, ProcefProStar for the $5.
[157:16.88]B-Day, B-Day, B-Day.
[157:19.16]They say, I drank too much wine.
[157:20.66]This stream is going to be very good.
[157:22.24]Happy 85th birthday to me.
[157:24.46]Well, happy birthday.
[157:26.75]Happy 85th birthday, ProSif.
[157:28.99]Much appreciated.
[157:29.51]Thanks for the $5, man.
[157:32.39]Wild... Wild HaBuddy gave $15 a while ago.
[157:39.81]Was having a rough day and that opening made my day.
[157:42.57]Thank you.
[157:42.97]Referring to Phantasmagoria.
[157:45.31]But thank you, Wild...
[157:47.66]Much appreciated, dude.
[157:48.32]Thanks for the $15.
[157:50.94]Also, Ivory, thanks for the bits.
[157:52.26]Frexter, thanks for the bits as well.
[157:55.80]Again, ProSip, ProStar, thanks for another $5.
[157:57.70]And they say the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[158:03.75]I've seriously had too much wine.
[158:05.35]I might have turned into Orson Welles.
[158:07.49]Oh, you're just drinking wine?
[158:09.95]So this was, okay, so ProSip, you're in chat still.
[158:11.87]This was four hours ago.
[158:14.64]Have you continued to drink wine for four hours?
[158:17.00]You must be destroyed right now.
[158:19.12]You must be absolutely shithouse right now.
[158:22.74]Well, hopefully you feel good, but thanks.
[158:25.76]I'm fine now.
[158:26.48]Oh, so you came down.
[158:27.34]No, you're sober now.
[158:28.90]That's cool.
[158:31.74]But thank you, dude.
[158:34.10]Gunther gave some bits as well.
[158:35.74]Thank you, Gunther.
[158:36.42]Jeremy, you've been banned 984 times.
[158:39.24]And Jeremy, 986.
[158:40.32]Why am I saying it like that?
[158:41.90]It doesn't have the same ring to it.
[158:43.22]Please be careful.
[158:45.26]No, we're fine.
[158:46.96]There was Twitch staff sitting in the chat room.
[158:49.90]He has like a button that just specifically bans humans.
[158:52.20]So my channel is still here.
[158:55.06]We're fine.
[158:55.54]Nothing bad.
[158:56.06]Nothing even happened.
[158:57.78]You got to see like, you get to see like somebody's back.
[159:04.57]Thank you to also Hobo Toaster for the $5.10.
[159:06.83]Hey there, Jerma985.
[159:10.09]First time donator.
[159:11.03]Long time viewer here.
[159:12.77]Love the content a ton, but I gotta ask, what the actual fuck are you playing?
[159:17.99]Uh, well, this is Halloween, uh, Fright Week.
[159:21.13]Uh, Freight Train Week.
[159:22.35]This is where we're just playing a bunch of old shitty Halloween games.
[159:25.79]Horror games.
[159:26.27]Uh, that's, uh, I'm not sure which one it was.
[159:30.15]There was like three or four in a row, right?
[159:31.60]There's three in a row.
[159:34.02]He thought he was drunk, but in reality he was just watching this stream.
[159:37.92]Heh.
[159:40.39]Again, please go buy Nosferatu for a dollar, even if you don't even want to play it.
[159:45.79]Like, support this developer.
[159:47.97]This is like from fucking 12 years ago.
[159:50.17]Support this developer 12 years ago.
[159:52.75]And give this random money to some random company that now owns the rights to this game.
[159:56.90]You know what?
[159:57.28]In fact, don't buy it.
[160:01.38]This developer's probably not going to see that money.
[160:03.08]Maybe they will.
[160:03.62]I don't know.
[160:06.28]You already bought it.
[160:07.65]Well, good.
[160:08.09]You probably enjoyed it.
[160:08.81]It's a fun game.
[160:10.79]Sir Feline, thank you for the $5.
[160:13.85]A movie featuring rats would be pretty fitting for Halloweek.
[160:17.84]You know what to do, Jerma.
[160:19.08]jermaRat.
[160:22.82]That's not a scary video.
[160:25.78]Stix, thank you.
[160:26.74]Stix, again, for $2.
[160:28.38]Parents' permission.
[160:29.64]I said you need parents' permission to watch the stream tonight.
[160:32.38]Hey, Mom, can I watch some compact streamer play some porn?
[160:37.14]Do not ask your mother that because then she's going to be like concerned and she's going to come to the stream and she's going to, she's going to hear me talk and she's going to be, I'm going to get like a letter in the mail.
[160:50.33]I'm going to get like an angry email.
[160:53.91]I don't want my inbox full of angry mother emails.
[160:58.62]You know what?
[160:58.90]I'm going to make sure because let's just say like a mother came and was like scrubbing through the footage and like ended up here somehow.
[161:04.04]It's like, yeah, I'm just going to click around.
[161:06.89]That's why doing your homework is extremely important.
[161:10.32]And vegetables, eat them all.
[161:13.06]As many as you can.
[161:14.32]And you have a balanced diet.
[161:16.24]Get some exercise.
[161:16.94]Go out with your friends.
[161:18.82]And respect your elders.
[161:20.28]That's the most important thing, guys.
[161:21.80]Respect your elders.
[161:23.29]Respect your mothers.
[161:24.69]Respect your mom.
[161:26.13]Respect your dad.
[161:27.03]Respect your grandparents.
[161:29.47]Because they should be respected.
[161:33.72]that's not even true they like already skimmed through this part you know what I mean they like stopped there and were like oh like he's a good guy okay okay my son can watch him there we go it's that easy respect the roller coaster ride
[161:55.54]Anyways, let's move on.
[161:56.84]Thank you again to sticks answer feline and We are almost half more than halfway there only like another like dozen or so Never trust purple.
[162:07.55]Thank you three dollars.
[162:09.95]I Love how Jerma is acting as if clicking on a chair is going to instantly cut to a full-on Hardcore sex scene and he's like hunched over the button ready to black out the screen.
[162:19.22]I was I Actually was doing that
[162:23.32]I was terrified of playing that game on stream after it was like, oh yeah, be careful.
[162:28.30]Like somebody like this gore and shit, but there's like a bunch of sex and murder and torture.
[162:32.72]I'm like, okay, well maybe I, alright, let's try it.
[162:37.34]But thank you.
[162:38.54]Also Red Walrus, thank you for the five bucks.
[162:40.42]Hey, wait a minute.
[162:41.00]This isn't Phantasmagoria Puzzle of Flesh.
[162:42.80]This is just regular Phantasmagoria, you peeing liar.
[162:46.30]Well, Phantasmagoria 1 is not a selectable game on Twitch.
[162:50.75]So I had to pick that one.
[162:52.12]But thank you, Red Walrus, for the $5.
[162:55.34]Ruffsta, thanks for the bits.
[162:56.52]Thanks for the $1.
[162:57.40]Mr. Kool-Aid, thanks for the $5.
[162:59.58]In ancient Rome, there was a poem about a dog who found two bones.
[163:03.38]He picked at one, he licked the other, and he went in circles, and then he dropped dead.
[163:11.09]Some kind of philosophical ancient Roman metaphor, I don't know.
[163:14.17]But thank you, Mr. Kool-Aid, for the $5.
[163:15.31]I don't know what that means.
[163:18.61]Wild Omelet, thanks for the bits.
[163:19.89]Grif, thank you for the $5.
[163:21.27]Grif779.
[163:26.77]Thank you for the $5.
[163:27.47]Here's a few bucks, bud.
[163:28.69]You should check out Kindergarten on Steam.
[163:31.61]Would love to see you play through it.
[163:36.47]You played a band... You played a band game with Steph in chat.
[163:41.84]Wait, Fantasmagoria was a band game?
[163:45.56]Was it?
[163:47.54]Whoops.
[163:49.54]It's okay, we played the censored version.
[163:51.04]Nobody saw anything.
[163:51.84]Oh, we just saw, like, somebody's, like, face get filled with, like, sand.
[163:59.11]It's not a banned game.
[164:06.41]Look, even if it's not a band game, I like to keep my... Look, there's something between gore and sexual violence gore.
[164:18.72]That's a line that I don't know if I'm... I'm not comfortable crossing.
[164:25.85]everybody has their lines I'm okay with like a little bit of you know fucking crazy shit but like if there really is like some really bad fucked up like sexual violence in that I don't want to show it I don't want to play it that's like something I don't want to do like that's not you know what I mean I don't know look you gotta have a stance on like what game you're willing to play right I think ow fuck my hand
[164:57.45]But you get the idea.
[164:59.45]And I'm sure it's, like, fine.
[165:00.61]I'm sure there's, like, really nuts.
[165:02.33]It's not, like, one of those scenarios.
[165:03.50]But I don't know.
[165:04.10]I just want to be careful.
[165:06.74]You never know.
[165:08.10]You don't know.
[165:08.50]Like, I could accidentally show on stream, and then I'm just like, well, it's been fun.
[165:15.10]It's been a real cool, like, two years straight on Twitch.
[165:17.78]See you guys never.
[165:20.04]You know, you just got to be careful.
[165:23.97]But anyways.
[165:24.73]Oh, Sark.
[165:25.31]Sark is here.
[165:25.89]Sark, I wish I went to your house.
[165:28.57]Can I just tell you that?
[165:31.34]I wanted to go to your house so bad.
[165:34.54]I was going to go to Sark's house.
[165:36.62]This is not even a joke.
[165:37.50]I was going to go.
[165:38.92]And it was going to be fucking awesome.
[165:40.14]And a bunch of shit just didn't work.
[165:43.20]I couldn't go.
[165:46.50]Dude, open invite.
[165:47.34]I would come over right now.
[165:49.14]I would get on a fucking airplane.
[165:51.53]That's not creepy to say.
[165:56.17]No, no, no, no.
[165:57.81]It's not like I was... I was invited to go over.
[166:01.73]It's not like I'm just gonna show up at Sark's house and just knock on his door and be like, hey, can I come in here?
[166:06.02]Let's talk about, like, the gore violence.
[166:10.64]Hey, Sark, can... Hey, Sark, can you let me in?
[166:13.00]You wanna talk about, like, extreme sexual gore?
[166:16.16]That's what I wanna talk about.
[166:17.32]That's what we're currently talking about.
[166:22.46]Like, Jesus.
[166:24.78]Anyways...
[166:27.85]Oh, Ricky's here too!
[166:29.25]Look at all these nice people that are here!
[166:31.17]What are you guys doing here so late?
[166:40.05]The difference between the shit in Red Dead versus the shit that is in potentially Phantasmagoria... That's different.
[166:48.00]That's very different.
[166:50.36]From my understanding.
[166:53.88]Hey, we heard you played an intense game.
[166:57.23]No, not really.
[166:59.79]Alright, let's keep going through here.
[167:03.31]Anyways, thank you, Mr. Kool-Aid.
[167:04.93]Thank you, Wild Omelet.
[167:05.65]Thank you, Griff779.
[167:06.98]No... I can't see your name ever.
[167:14.18]NoKTA.
[167:16.49]Live.
[167:17.41]I'm going to call you Liver Girl.
[167:19.86]I'm going to call you the gull.
[167:20.78]I'm going to call you Liver Gull.
[167:22.68]The seagull.
[167:23.20]Liver Seagull.
[167:24.22]Thank you, Liver Girl, for the $1.
[167:26.46]Appreciate it.
[167:27.02]Am I going to play Stalker again on stream?
[167:28.46]Apparently there's a Stalker 2 that I never played.
[167:31.98]So that would be fun.
[167:36.58]But thank you.
[167:37.26]Thank you also to Jdog.
[167:38.46]Thank you to Swazby.
[167:41.28]Westfar, thank you for the bits as well.
[167:42.92]Swazby again.
[167:43.88]They say Kappa.
[167:48.08]Uh, Nibono, thank you for the bits.
[167:53.96]And Matherin, thanks for the $5.
[167:55.66]Almost at the end here.
[167:56.46]The sequel to Shadow Man ran into some controversy before it came out.
[168:01.37]Um, they had planned, they were going to advertise, plans of advertising the title on small billboards on tombstones were announced.
[168:09.41]Saying they would pay relatives for the advertising.
[168:12.93]Oh, wow.
[168:15.91]That's pretty not cool.
[168:18.70]They were going to run an ad campaign putting billboards on people's tombstones?
[168:23.20]Well, that does not sound good.
[168:31.02]Nobody likes Stalker 2, just skip to Stalker 3.
[168:34.89]Wait a minute.
[168:35.29]No, we're talking about the wrong thing, guys.
[168:37.05]I'm talking about Stalked.
[168:39.48]Because of like Halloween week.
[168:40.60]I'm talking about Stalked, not Stalker.
[168:43.52]Well, okay, hold on.
[168:44.32]Let's... Hold on.
[168:46.57]Let me back up for a minute.
[168:48.25]Stalker 2.
[168:50.05]I'm talking about Stalked 2.
[168:52.09]I'm talking about the game where Burgah Boy puked on camera.
[168:55.07]Remember Stalked?
[168:59.12]Burgah Boy threw up on camera.
[169:00.68]It's actually on my channel.
[169:01.62]You can go watch it.
[169:03.56]Nobody's, like, talked about that video, by the way.
[169:05.79]I made that video, like, four and a half years ago.
[169:07.97]Burgah Boy, like, throws up in his hand, in his mouth, on webcam.
[169:12.77]Because he was laughing so hard at that game.
[169:16.41]So, there's a stalked two.
[169:19.29]To answer the actual previous question, I probably am not going to go play any of the new stalkers anytime soon.
[169:24.87]Any of the other stalkers.
[169:27.33]As interesting as they are.
[169:28.65]Maybe.
[169:30.79]But thank you, Mattford.
[169:33.88]for the $5 and also to... Who even asked that question?
[169:42.78]I don't know.
[169:44.64]Anyways, Edgemont, thank you for the $20.
[169:47.50]Here's to the new keyboard fund.
[169:49.99]Well, that $20 is going to go to a new X. So thank you, Edgemont.
[169:54.39]Appreciate it, man.
[169:56.01]Holeof1zombie, thank you for the 10 bucks.
[169:58.19]This is nice joke.
[169:59.67]I think you might be referring to the keyboard.
[170:01.05]That wasn't a joke.
[170:01.70]I actually ripped it off because I'm not used to using my left hand to press the buttons down there.
[170:09.44]You fixed it?
[170:09.86]It is fixed.
[170:10.28]Yeah, that's good.
[170:13.09]Thank you, Prostar again for the bits.
[170:16.73]Also, Squall again.
[170:17.79]When are you going on tour?
[170:19.13]Never.
[170:20.35]Absolutely never.
[170:23.04]Going through, thanks again for the bits.
[170:24.28]This stream was honestly been fucking hilarious and I feel like I owe you this extra dollar.
[170:28.18]Well, you don't owe me anything.
[170:30.48]You don't owe me a damn thing.
[170:32.92]So, your time is important as well.
[170:37.27]Never forget that.

[170:48.10]But welcome back, man.
[170:48.94]Good to see you again.
[170:53.96]Am I almost done with Neptune?
[170:55.16]Almost.
[170:56.84]And by almost, I mean no.
[171:00.26]Dim Ding Dong Doug.
[171:03.50]Okay, thanks, Doug.
[171:05.20]Thank you, Doug, for the five bucks.
[171:07.44]Fucking love you, Jerma.

[171:31.56]But thank you, Aw Freeman, for the $5.

[171:42.52]Gonna buy myself something nice.
[171:46.25]Can you buy anything for 25 cents anymore?
[171:48.37]Does anything exist?
[171:51.10]It used to be you could buy gum for like 50 cents.
[171:54.72]What kind of quarter?
[171:55.26]Can a quarter buy you anything?
[171:57.46]Whatever that thing can buy me with a quarter, I'm going to use it.
[172:00.52]But thank you, man.
[172:03.44]Gumball.

[172:09.63]Yeah, that's true.
[172:11.45]Alright.
[172:11.81]Thank you also to Ewert We... I... Ewert Weigert Yurtwert.
[172:22.31]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[172:25.53]Some of you guys have these names that I just, I can't read them to save my life.
[172:30.85]When are you going to play Zoombinis?
[172:33.77]Got to get it to run on this computer.
[172:35.48]It might be like hard to get to run on Windows 10.
[172:39.16]You want to know a funny story about Zumbinis before we go?
[172:41.54]First, let me just say thanks before we end this.
[172:44.08]SticksRenegade and DingusMcGruberPants for the bits.
[172:49.74]Sticks says, I don't have a dollar to spend.
[172:52.70]Oh.
[172:54.68]Now I do.
[172:56.22]So thank you.
[172:57.50]But that's it for the bits.
[172:58.64]Thank you, everybody, for the support and the money.
[173:04.61]Let's just put it in quotes.
[173:05.63]Thanks for the money.
[173:07.15]You guys rock.
[173:07.61]Thank you.
[173:09.13]So here's what happened with the Zumbini before I'm going to turn the stream off here in a minute.
[173:14.95]So when I was in Little League, the Little League baseball had like this banquet.
[173:23.04]And it was a raffle.
[173:25.74]I was involved in a raffle.
[173:26.86]It was everybody in Little League was involved in this big raffle.
[173:30.21]A lot years ago.
[173:32.49]And my number got called.
[173:35.83]It was a bunch of shit on the table.
[173:37.35]It was literally just a grab.
[173:38.79]There was like computer games, video games.
[173:41.74]There was a lawnmower.
[173:44.36]That wasn't a lawnmower.
[173:45.06]I'm just making that up because there was stuff on the table.
[173:46.72]It was like pens and notebooks and book bags.
[173:49.78]Just imagine a bunch of shit that like a kid would think was cool, right?
[173:53.32]So my number, 965-2284.
[173:54.57]That was my number.
[173:59.50]And there was like 600 people in this room.
[174:02.52]So that felt good.
[174:04.02]I got the runner's high from that one.
[174:08.00]And I walked up, perused the table, didn't want the pens, didn't want the soda, didn't want the fucking Dunkin' Donuts gift card, whatever the hell it was.
[174:19.21]The Zumbini's computer game was standing up there in the big box.
[174:24.03]Grabbed it.
[174:25.33]What the hell is this?
[174:26.19]Zumbini's.
[174:28.45]And I took it home and it turned out to be one of my favorite video games ever.
[174:32.51]So there's your story.
[174:35.59]I got the Zumbini's game in a raffle when I was like 13 or like 12 and installed it on my computer and it was fucking awesome.
[174:42.64]And so, yes, we're going to nostalgia.
[174:44.14]We're going to put on the rose colored glasses.
[174:45.64]I'm going to go play pizza.
[174:47.74]That's the only thing that's on that whole disk that's worth playing.
[174:50.95]Now, that's not true.
[174:51.61]A couple more.
[174:54.85]But.
[174:59.16]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[175:01.22]They're like, hmm, what else do I have to say?
[175:05.54]Good night, everybody.
[175:06.72]Thank you for sticking around for this stream.
[175:09.10]Hopefully you enjoyed yourselves.
[175:11.03]I had a lot of fun.
[175:12.39]Hopefully we continue the fun tomorrow.
[175:14.45]And hopefully we do not play any banned video games.
[175:17.19]We're going to make sure we do that.
[175:18.35]Make sure we don't play any, like, banned games.
[175:20.13]Although, I don't know, one of these in particular might be very bad.
[175:23.96]And I might have to, I might look into this one because it could be one of those terrible games.
[175:30.37]We'll see.
[175:32.15]Good night, guys.
[175:32.53]See you tomorrow.
[176:09.39]Why am I typing?
[176:10.09]I could just say it.
[176:10.99]The game is Harvester.
[176:14.33]So, that's one of them.
[176:15.81]That's tomorrow.
[176:16.91]Or Friday, depending on how far we get in the other things.
[176:21.97]So I'm going to have to look into that before I stream it.
[176:24.13]So we'll see.
[176:24.87]Okay, good night.
[176:26.71]I'm gone.
[176:27.07]See you later.
[176:31.32]Bye-bye.
