[00:01.89]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the stream.
[00:03.21]This is the start of the stream.
[00:05.61]We're just getting prepared here.
[00:06.59]We're gonna play Intruder with Criken.
[00:13.24]It's a fun game.
[00:15.44]It's a game where you... I think it's a stealth action oriented multiplayer experience.
[00:25.37]Where you mess with your friends, you try to swindle people, take over people and attack them.
[00:31.82]I'm looking forward to it.
[00:37.49]So I'm going to hop on into their Discord and we're going to get started here.
[00:39.73]Just give me about one minute or two and we'll get this going.
[00:43.58]Hold on tight, guys.
[02:32.34]Alright.
[02:33.06]I'm almost ready.
[02:33.86]Hold on.
[02:37.16]Give me a few more minutes.
[02:38.86]I gotta change my stream stuff.
[02:40.62]And then you're gonna hear a bunch of fucking voices that aren't mine, okay?
[02:43.93]Here on out, here comes the intruder!
[02:46.89]Whatever the fuck this game is.
[02:48.21]Can't wait.
[02:49.23]See you in a minute.
[04:02.60]Let me, let me do this.
[04:06.62]Here we go.
[04:07.08]Alright.
[04:15.59]What is even on the other screen right now?
[04:19.85]That's a good question.
[04:20.59]Hold on.
[04:25.87]So you should be seeing something in a minute.
[04:31.09]Let's turn this off.
[04:33.75]Come back here.
[04:39.69]Hey, did that work?
[04:41.99]Oh my god, it worked.
[04:44.37]Unbelievable.
[04:47.80]Except you can't see it.
[04:48.54]Yeah, you can.
[04:49.90]Maybe, I guess you can.
[04:51.76]Okay.
[04:53.26]Apparently I'm dead.
[04:58.18]Oh, I didn't do anything.
[05:03.27]I don't know who I am.
[05:04.19]He's like, can you leave?
[05:12.96]Can you fucking leave, dude?
[05:18.98]Fuck.
[05:21.38]They think I'm just some random guy that got into the server.
[05:30.11]Oh, that's funny.
[05:31.79]We're going to be laughing about that one later.
[05:38.05]I don't even have a keybind.
[05:39.37]I need to talk to somebody.
[05:47.34]What if I just got food?
[05:48.42]Should I talk and prove myself?
[05:52.24]Hello?
[05:52.44]Hello?
[05:56.57]Hey, I'm... Was that somebody over VoIP or was that... What was that?
[06:10.62]What are we looking at here?
[06:12.06]Can anybody hear me?
[06:20.31]The screen is... What happened to the screen?
[06:30.74]Am I playing the game right now?
[06:35.02]Oh!
[06:40.88]What was that?
[06:42.76]I just... Is there a... Is somebody... Is that a person actually talking?
[06:54.09]Are these in-game voice actors?
[06:55.75]Or is this like... Is this like just dialog that was...
[07:03.38]Oh, these are people talking.
[07:05.08]There's people in here.
[07:09.60]Wait, why is there no audio?
[07:10.70]Oh, no, okay, wait, wait, wait.
[07:11.88]There we go.
[07:12.38]Now you should be able to hear this.
[07:22.72]Can you hear me?
[07:26.65]I don't think they can hear me.
[07:28.63]Can you hear me?
[07:32.64]Are you an in-game character or are you a person?
[07:38.72]We're all real.
[07:40.54]Everybody's real in here?
[07:43.40]Hello?
[07:44.76]Oh, so what's the snapping?
[07:49.13]Get it together, man.
[07:50.03]How do I do that?
[07:50.79]You place your fingers together and you just click them.
[07:58.21]You want to get a good amount of friction?
[08:00.17]That's not how you do it.
[08:03.32]He saw me use my hand, and then I karate chopped him.
[08:09.40]Oh, OK.
[08:10.80]What's the other hand button?
[08:17.33]Tab?
[08:17.71]Look, I don't know how to whistle either.
[08:20.39]Tab.
[08:22.23]Oh.
[08:22.81]Oh, there we go.
[08:23.35]Hey.
[08:27.45]You did good.
[08:34.08]Are you guys holding guns?
[08:43.27]I feel like I'm in a fucking nightmare right now.
[08:47.99]I'm in a goddamn nightmare.
[08:49.43]No!
[09:05.94]Frickin' in the middle of a nightmare.
[09:08.94]Why did you follow me down here?
[09:13.62]Why?
[09:14.90]Are we supposed to be roleplaying?
[09:15.88]Alright, fine, I'll roleplay.
[09:17.02]I didn't know we were supposed to be doing that.
[09:19.18]I don't even know what we're doing.
[09:20.34]I got invited to this.
[09:21.91]Hold on a second.
[09:22.61]Wait, oh.
[09:23.61]I thought she was just flying.
[09:24.97]Idiots.
[09:27.99]I don't know.
[09:28.31]Unbelievable.
[09:29.49]No, these are real people.
[09:30.19]They have to be.
[09:32.03]Alright, well, did I get, like, dragged into something else?
[09:36.94]They're currently streaming right now.
[09:41.46]We're going to have to communicate through in-game touchscreen.
[09:46.78]What?
[09:52.38]Anyway, let's just minimize this.
[10:00.79]How do I respawn?
[10:02.49]Okay.
[10:03.99]What are we supposed to be doing?
[10:09.55]Are we the intruders?
[10:12.25]Yes, we are.
[10:14.83]Inside the enemy base, there is a briefcase.
[10:17.93]And it's our job to go and retrieve said briefcase without getting spotted, shot, or dead.
[10:25.24]Okay.
[10:25.96]I really hate to break it to you.
[10:27.44]This is my first day on the job.
[10:28.62]I have no fucking clue what I'm doing.
[10:30.50]Okay, hold on.
[10:33.08]Okay, I'm ready.
[10:35.14]Where did we get the supplies?
[10:39.13]Are you ready?
[10:43.50]Should we pick up the car battery?
[10:46.48]Car battery.
[10:47.14]You take whatever you want.
[10:50.26]What is this?
[10:53.46]Oh.
[10:55.89]I got a red dot sight in binoculars.
[10:57.11]In case you need it.
[10:57.99]I can be the spot guy.
[11:01.55]Hey, Zyke.
[11:02.39]Zyke, you're danger close to the edge.
[11:04.83]We'll get...
[11:09.19]I'm not gonna push you.
[11:10.95]I'll catch you if things get hairy, though.
[11:14.59]Not her.
[11:14.79]I'm pressing the wrong fucking push-to-talk button.
[11:16.52]How do I... I don't know what's going on, man.
[11:23.30]What the fuck is happening?
[11:25.42]See, I'm not like a character anymore.
[11:26.97]I'm not a character anymore.
[11:29.15]Follow me.
[11:34.21]I just did that accidentally.
[11:39.14]Oh, do we need to let go of this at a certain time?
[11:45.22]Oh, there we go.
[11:46.14]Alright, here we are.
[11:49.44]Okay.
[11:51.57]Code name, Ghost Fox.
[11:53.53]Code name, Kids Next Door.
[11:55.03]What's the name of the mission?
[11:57.03]Alright, Kids Next Door, let's get it.
[11:58.13]We need to sit rep.
[12:01.59]Okay.
[12:01.83]How do we do that?
[12:03.67]I don't really know.
[12:05.92]Tech could use a firearm.
[12:07.90]You know how to use that thing?
[12:12.64]I've used one before.
[12:14.72]Good, good.
[12:15.48]Good, good.
[12:18.57]Calling in.
[12:19.21]Anyone on the radio?
[12:23.19]Testing one, two, three.
[12:26.12]Hello?
[12:26.80]Anyone there?
[12:33.68]Hello, if I go far away like can you can you hear me through the radio is it proximity?
[12:37.62]How does it work?
[12:39.58]Wait, are you pushing in the button on the radio?
[12:42.32]I don't know.
[12:42.60]Am I?
[12:45.75]You hear the F, right?
[12:49.27]Get down.
[12:50.45]Get down.
[12:50.77]Get down.
[12:54.09]Okay.
[12:56.33]If you got a clean shot, man, you got to take it.
[13:05.20]Shit.
[13:07.34]Shit.
[13:07.62]Help.
[13:08.00]Don didn't see as much of a swimmer.
[13:12.65]Don?
[13:17.23]Uh, hello?
[13:18.95]Oh, that's how you use the radio.
[13:22.10]Alright, I'm, um... You stay there.
[13:23.66]Give me your position.
[13:25.78]Can you hear me?
[13:27.58]Yeah, I can hear you loud and clear.
[13:29.18]Over.
[13:30.14]Is it proximity, or is it... How does it work?
[13:33.65]I think it's just wherever you are, whenever you are, go through.
[13:37.66]Over.
[13:39.36]So what's the point of the radio if we can hear each other at all times?
[13:41.68]Over.
[13:43.74]Oh, no, just the radio.
[13:44.56]We can hear each other at all times.
[13:45.62]Over.
[13:46.96]So if we have the radio equipped, then we should be able to hear each other.
[13:49.44]Over.
[13:52.26]Only pushing the button.
[13:53.16]Over.
[13:54.76]Okay, I'm not going to push the button down over, but you should... Oh, and I already said... He's not doing me!
[13:59.76]He's not doing me!
[14:00.62]I'm going to keep pushing the button down.
[14:02.88]I'm going to stop pushing the button down after I count down from three.
[14:07.28]Three, two, one.
[14:08.76]I'm just going to turn around because I... There's something over here going on.
[14:12.41]You're going to have to come over here.
[14:13.85]It's over.
[14:14.13]You're going to have to come over.
[14:15.83]You're going to have to come down here.
[14:17.05]I'm coming over.
[14:17.81]Over.
[14:19.11]Come over here and you have to come over.
[14:20.67]Come down here.
[14:21.13]Over.
[14:21.39]Come over here.
[14:21.89]Over.
[14:23.60]On my way, over.
[14:29.27]We got three homo sapiens here, over.
[14:33.17]Can you give me your location, over.
[14:36.97]I think they can hear me here, over.
[14:39.41]Yep, they can hear you if they're homo sapiens.
[14:43.47]You're under arrest, sir.
[14:45.87]I think they definitely can hear me talking right now, over.
[14:48.85]I'm coming right behind you.
[14:50.29]You're under arrest too.
[14:52.47]Both of you are going to jail.
[14:54.51]You're both going to jail.
[14:55.49]Apparently they want us to.
[14:56.27]They're going to put us to jail over?
[14:57.69]Yeah, yeah.
[14:58.15]I'm hearing that right loud and clear.
[15:00.49]What's the situation?
[15:02.56]What do we do?
[15:03.82]What I say is we should probably do a one, two, three punch, I think.
[15:08.88]Don't move a muscle.
[15:16.08]Don't move a muscle, kid.
[15:17.98]It doesn't have to go the way you think it's going to go.
[15:20.66]If you can still hear me, apparently they're shooting.
[15:23.68]It looks like you slipped over.
[15:32.35]I didn't get that.
[15:39.46]Where's the gun?
[15:41.28]Where's the gun?
[15:43.58]Run me down.
[15:44.66]He's going to run me down.
[15:46.76]He's going crazy.
[15:47.62]He's out of control.
[15:49.11]He's out of control.
[15:51.49]You can hear me.
[15:52.97]I just rescued you.
[15:53.61]I just... He's on the cliffside.
[15:59.51]What's happening, right?
[16:00.35]I have no idea what the fuck is happening.
[16:01.64]He's on the cliff.
[16:03.04]He's on the cliff.
[16:06.36]Oh my god, you killed him!
[16:14.82]What is this?
[16:15.62]What is this?
[16:16.00]What are you doing?
[16:17.26]What is this thing?
[16:17.92]Put that in my face.
[16:18.94]I'm going to take a picture.
[16:20.54]It's a selfie stick.
[16:22.92]Put the selfie stick.
[16:23.70]This is a serious situation.
[16:25.04]Come on.
[16:26.00]Oh, you're right.
[16:26.68]There you go.
[16:31.59]I'm not going to shoot you, I promise.
[16:33.43]Okay, good.
[16:34.45]I was getting a little concerned.
[16:36.66]I'm just testing my ADS.
[16:38.74]Uh-huh.
[16:43.96]There was a bird.
[16:44.64]Had to shoot him.
[16:46.94]We're testing this guy to see how his reflex is.
[16:48.90]If you hear a shot, you start shooting.
[16:50.16]What the fuck are these?
[16:56.95]Would you like some stationery?
[17:00.31]We don't want to use... Don't use those.
[17:03.58]What are these?
[17:04.26]These are like notebooks.
[17:05.36]These explode.
[17:07.04]Are you sure these aren't bathroom tiles?
[17:09.02]What the fuck is going on?
[17:10.16]I don't even know.
[17:10.86]Is there a game?
[17:11.68]Is there a game here?
[17:12.94]I don't know.
[17:30.94]Go ahead and call it in.
[17:33.06]When do we start the game?
[17:36.77]Pizza!
[17:41.27]I feel like I'm being... Alright, you know, what's that Bill Murray movie?
[17:44.63]What's the Bill Murray movie?
[17:46.53]Where, like, somebody hires a bunch of actors to, like, pretend and give them a good time?
[17:51.32]Is that what's going on?
[17:53.54]Alright cadets, let's all line up here.
[17:57.06]Snap, snap.

[18:07.47]Yeah?

[18:11.85]Let's all get in the line here.
[18:15.95]Come on.
[18:16.29]It's everyone's baby's first time on the job.
[18:18.63]Do we have to get in the line?
[18:20.31]Yes, yes.
[18:20.93]Come on.
[18:22.81]Oh, not a vertical line.
[18:23.77]Horizontal.
[18:24.63]Horizontal.
[18:27.53]Yes, sir.
[18:29.05]Okay.
[18:29.45]Well, I guess if I face this... And look at me.
[18:33.00]Yes, sir.
[18:34.38]It takes me a minute.
[18:37.44]You're a slow one, huh?
[18:38.68]Alright.
[18:39.52]Who's the... You know, who's been here the longest?
[18:42.00]Let's hear it.
[18:42.50]Sound off.
[18:43.58]Age.
[18:45.94]Me.
[18:47.37]Are we talking about who the oldest is?
[18:49.41]It's probably me.
[18:51.31]Oh, yeah?
[18:51.75]How old?
[18:54.55]26.
[18:55.92]Oh, shit.
[18:56.38]Yeah, you get up there as you're commanding us.
[19:00.18]Okay, as your commanding officer, I've been promoted immediately.
[19:03.94]I'm not exactly sure why.
[19:06.20]Sir, yes, sir.
[19:07.56]Thank you.
[19:08.45]You know what?
[19:10.01]That's the kind of wherewithal that I like.
[19:11.97]You're promoted.
[19:13.29]I would like to promote you to captain.
[19:15.77]Thank you, sir.
[19:17.77]Alright, guys.
[19:19.44]Thank you for your kindness, and thank you all for coming out tonight.
[19:22.68]So I will kick off the night by... Here is my first poem.
[19:28.16]This one is titled, Yes Ma'am.
[19:32.11]Yes.
[19:33.69]Yes, ma'am.
[19:34.91]This one's called Yes Ma'am.
[19:43.98]Hey, uh, I'm doing a poetry reading.
[19:46.36]You could just... I didn't know we were doing poetry reading.
[19:48.88]I thought we were doing, uh, missions.
[19:50.88]I mean, like, um... That comes next, man.
[19:52.92]You gotta, you gotta mentally prepare.
[19:54.44]Thank you.
[19:57.56]Thank you.
[19:58.73]I appreciate it.
[20:00.89]Was that the poem?
[20:01.53]Tomorrow came.
[20:03.31]I was still underground.
[20:06.11]Knock, knock, knock.
[20:07.47]$500 in debt.
[20:13.67]My mother is around the corner.
[20:15.29]I look into her purse.
[20:20.79]Tomorrow never came.
[20:22.81]You got that on multiple pages?
[20:23.89]It was four words.
[20:26.94]He writes big, okay?
[20:28.62]Some of us have, you know, we all have our own penmanship style.
[20:30.98]That's true, that's true.
[20:33.24]Please revoke that from the record.
[20:36.78]Snaps for that.
[20:37.32]That was brave.
[20:40.54]It's like bed bananas.
[20:42.16]So everyone go ahead and round of applause.
[20:46.67]Is that how we do applause?
[20:49.09]Underground, without a sound, I looked upon my son who had a frown.
[20:57.70]He wanted to be a clown, so I left town.
[21:05.50]You don't get any claps from me.
[21:09.93]I didn't even hold the V down for that one.
[21:11.67]I'm down.
[21:12.09]Who has the briefcase?
[21:12.81]What is this for?
[21:13.17]Should I call somebody?
[21:34.47]Yeah, go ahead.
[21:35.13]Let me try my iPhone password.
[21:36.51]That didn't work.
[21:41.61]Alright.
[21:45.12]Maybe one of them knows the code.
[21:47.46]This might be a rookie mistake.
[21:49.54]How do I take my hand off this?
[21:52.54]Nothing.
[21:53.16]Just walk away, you know?
[21:54.56]With any vice, really, if you leave it alone, it won't be a problem.
[22:00.43]Leave it alone.
[22:02.29]Like a phone.
[22:04.28]Hey, he fell.
[22:04.96]He fell down.
[22:05.52]No, he didn't.
[22:06.23]He grabbed.
[22:06.89]That's the boathouse we're going to.
[22:08.59]Please help.
[22:09.41]Please help me.
[22:09.93]I'm going in alone.
[22:12.37]Oh, by the way, I believe Criken is streaming this as well.
[22:14.73]If you're curious.
[22:17.05]I don't know which one of them he is.
[22:19.67]I'm going to go down the zip line.
[22:25.33]Don't put that there.
[22:26.57]Come on.
[22:26.93]No pizzas.
[22:29.30]Hey guys, the intern trick is working.
[22:33.03]I think they're gonna buy it.
[22:34.51]Radio is definitely not right click.
[22:37.07]No, no.
[22:38.75]You need to help me, man.
[22:39.95]Oh, I need to help you find the radio.
[22:41.75]What do I keep throwing here?
[22:46.01]I just, I just, I get counter-terrorist win.
[22:49.43]I just disabled the bomb.
[22:54.05]You know, I'm... Oh, it's F. I found it.
[22:56.96]Hello, where are you?
[23:00.21]I'm waiting for you to go down, because I ain't stepping on any bathroom bomb pizza tiles.
[23:06.07]Are you fucking, are you scared or something?
[23:08.17]No, I'm not.
[23:08.67]Are you scared?
[23:09.21]I missed it!
[23:13.49]I'm in the base.
[23:14.53]They let me through.
[23:17.87]Alright, Roger that.
[23:18.87]I'm coming in.
[23:20.23]Hot.
[23:20.98]Hot like a pizza.
[23:21.64]Am I dead for good?
[23:24.14]Yeah.
[23:24.82]You've made a pizza.
[23:26.79]You know what, after this, after this is all over, let's head out of my place.
[23:30.32]Come on, he was fucking with me.
[23:32.38]I was trying to jump over.
[23:33.56]He was gonna blow me up with the pizza tires.
[23:35.34]I can't swim in the water, dude.
[23:36.50]Don't fucking kill me.
[23:37.50]I just stand in the truck.
[23:41.47]How am I fucking actually dead?
[23:42.93]Why?
[23:43.63]Oh, come on.
[23:44.79]I have to, like, watch.
[23:49.41]Can you guys hear me if I'm a ghost?
[23:53.08]No, nobody can hear me.
[23:56.00]I get to just watch them play.
[23:58.16]Oh, he's gone.
[24:02.12]Come on.
[24:03.24]I've jumped off of bigger bridges than that.
[24:06.79]For fun.
[24:08.29]Wait, have I?
[24:11.09]Yeah, I definitely have.
[24:12.37]So how's it going?
[24:17.13]It's pretty good.
[24:18.47]I'm okay.
[24:19.11]Wait, nobody can hear me.
[24:20.01]Yeah, we died the same way.
[24:21.09]Oh, wait, no.
[24:22.23]Oh, so only ghosts can hear ghosts.
[24:24.39]Wow, is this what it's like?
[24:25.07]This is probably what it's like when people die.
[24:28.23]What?
[24:28.61]No, it sucks.
[24:31.15]Just watch them live their lives without you like you were nothing.
[24:35.65]Where are you?
[24:36.47]Do we show up as little specters on the screen or no?
[24:38.63]Can we just hear each other?
[24:40.63]We just hear each other.
[24:44.81]Roger, copy.
[24:45.19]Copy.
[24:46.00]How do you think this is gonna play out?
[24:49.06]I think three years from now we'll eventually go crazy because we have no bodies of our own.
[24:53.76]And we'll eventually create our own reality, which we do.
[24:56.82]And life will get easier.
[24:57.72]That was a good answer.
[25:02.27]Are you still in there?
[25:04.55]So nobody has like a respawn drone?
[25:09.27]No, no.
[25:09.87]Not here.
[25:10.17]Hello?
[25:14.03]Just voice.
[25:15.21]Alright, let's follow.
[25:15.89]I'm gonna follow Zuthar up the stairs.
[25:18.76]See what happens.
[25:22.92]Hello?
[25:25.64]Hello?
[25:25.96]I don't think there's anybody here.
[25:29.61]I'm in the base.
[25:30.57]Hi, hi, hi.
[25:31.69]How's it going?
[25:32.61]You said for me to come... I'm not doing a very good job of preventing this.
[25:35.61]Are you around here somewhere?
[25:36.73]Do you want to meet up?
[25:38.07]Are you on the bridge over there?
[25:39.20]I'm on the roof right now.
[25:42.64]I'm talking to ladies.
[25:43.64]What are you doing?
[25:44.88]What have you done?
[25:46.08]Is this you down here?
[25:46.90]Wait, jump.
[25:47.52]I'm supposed to be getting a briefcase.
[25:51.21]Who's even on what team?
[25:53.19]Is this one of those games where there's an objective that never gets done and everyone just like throws fucking rocks at each other?
[25:58.08]Did you just kill your own friend?
[26:20.54]I'm getting the briefcase, just fucking, just you wait.
[26:23.12]I'm gonna get the briefcase next time, guys.
[26:24.88]I'm gonna play by the rules, and I ain't gonna fucking make any jokes.
[26:27.56]I'm going right for the fucking briefcase.
[26:30.57]They ain't gonna get any jokes out of me.
[26:33.83]No, I'm not gonna say anything.
[26:34.75]I'm not gonna say anything funny.
[26:36.15]I'm just gonna go to the briefcase and take it dead fucking seriously.
[26:39.91]I'm gonna mow everyone down.
[26:43.00]I'm gonna shoot everyone.
[26:44.48]And I'm going right for that fucking briefcase.
[26:46.06]I don't even know where it is, but I'm gonna get it.
[26:48.44]Do you know what a briefcase is?
[26:51.22]Uh, briefcase, briefcase.
[26:53.60]Oh, these guys.
[26:54.36]Bang!
[26:55.02]Bang!
[26:55.44]Bullet.
[26:55.74]One bullet.
[26:56.12]Two bullets.
[26:56.54]Go ahead and take him there.
[26:57.27]I gotta take another couple calls.
[26:59.53]Did you scuba stomp that person?
[27:01.05]What's going on?
[27:02.83]He just... What?
[27:04.83]Why do you do this?
[27:06.61]RDM.
[27:07.83]RDM.
[27:07.95]Yeah, dude.
[27:08.45]RDM.
[27:08.65]Ban me.
[27:09.01]I'm gonna RDM and just get banned from the server immediately.
[27:18.60]I fell.
[27:19.10]I'm sorry.
[27:19.34]Someone fell on my head.
[27:25.33]It's on the computers.
[27:27.25]Look at that.
[27:29.65]It's a lot of pain.
[27:31.01]Who gives a shit what anyone's saying?
[27:33.17]Our job right now, guys, is to find the fucking briefcase room.
[27:36.13]Which room is it in?
[27:37.77]Not in this empty asset room.
[27:38.95]I don't even care.
[27:41.17]Where's the briefcase?
[27:41.75]Let's find it so I can put a mental note in my brain and go get it immediately.
[27:46.18]Follow me.
[27:48.92]Briefcase.
[27:49.32]Which room?
[27:50.82]Nope, not in this one.
[27:53.50]Briefcase in this room?
[27:54.88]Maybe.
[27:55.90]No, that's a computer.
[27:59.07]No, nothing in here.
[28:02.21]Fuck.
[28:09.59]I can't even find the briefcase when I'm in free cam mode.
[28:12.79]Oh, the location moves every time.
[28:14.15]Fuck!
[28:15.81]That noise, Jesus Christ.
[28:18.47]Can I get a radio in?
[28:19.63]What just happened there?
[28:21.18]I just heard an explosion.
[28:22.56]That hurt my head.
[28:26.66]Can I get a radio in?
[28:28.04]What just happened there?
[28:29.40]I don't even know what team anybody's on.
[28:32.85]I guess the blue team is one team.
[28:35.76]Where did she go?

[28:50.58]And I'm going to just run straight in.
[28:52.67]I'm going to end the game immediately.

[30:21.68]I never want to... Well, he's gone.
[30:26.92]We're taking this dead serious, by the way.
[30:29.16]Absolute dead serious.
[30:32.02]No messing around here.
[30:34.94]We're going in and we're getting the briefcase.
[30:37.59]Okay, didn't expect you not to take it.
[30:39.95]Dead serious.
[30:41.75]Okay, sure.
[30:43.33]You ever seen that movie with the Joker?
[30:46.51]Batman, yeah.
[30:48.59]What's the famous line he says right at the very beginning of the movie?
[30:53.29]See how these got scars?
[30:55.25]No.
[30:55.85]Go even further back.
[30:58.97]Further back.
[31:01.19]Find my wife.
[31:02.23]Further back.
[31:05.62]Fuck you, Batman.
[31:07.74]You're getting close.
[31:09.26]But whatever doesn't kill you makes you a stranger!
[31:15.04]Let's go.
[31:17.41]Going in.
[31:22.13]Where is it?
[31:22.45]Over here.
[31:28.48]How do you How do you grab the fucking how do you grab the zip line Watch
[31:53.99]Oh, never mind.
[31:54.43]That one's too high.
[31:55.13]Don't touch that one.
[31:55.91]No, do that one.
[31:56.39]Do that one.
[31:56.75]I want to see you do that one.
[31:57.57]Remember, if you're good at something, never do it for free.
[31:59.04]Oh, my.
[31:59.38]Oh, fuck.
[32:03.90]No, no, no, no.
[32:07.14]Oh, shit.
[32:08.86]I thought they were all dead.
[32:14.56]I am not going to do it again.
[32:15.58]I'm not going to do it again.
[32:17.08]Wait.
[32:19.70]I can't even do the fucking thing I want to do.
[32:25.31]How do I... I think I made somebody angry.
[32:30.11]I hope not.
[32:35.24]I wanted to kill everybody and then go play the objective.
[32:37.64]Look, we're going to play the long con this next time.
[32:40.66]I'm going to go... Hold on.
[32:44.67]Oh, wait, I can get up.
[32:46.27]I can get up.
[32:47.07]Are you dead?
[32:47.45]Why can't I go?
[32:47.83]I'm not dead!
[32:53.37]I'm the only one that made it out alive.
[32:56.09]I made it out alive.
[32:59.70]Alright, let me get this right.
[33:01.14]If you're good at something, never do it for free.
[33:02.78]The Joker always wins.
[33:08.04]Wait, what's this zip line?
[33:09.22]I'm going on the wrong zip line.
[33:11.34]Here we go.
[33:11.70]This one right here.
[33:12.99]We're going straight for the briefcase.
[33:16.06]Got it.
[33:21.56]I'm gonna play their little... I'm gonna play their little game and one by one take them out.
[33:24.56]Just watch.
[33:26.66]Hey!
[33:27.32]Whoa!
[33:28.44]That was a weird ride.
[33:29.90]Hey there.
[33:31.18]How you guys are?
[33:33.02]How you guys up to?
[33:33.86]Oh, toll booth stuff.
[33:39.18]If you're good at something, never do it for free.
[33:46.02]You're under arrest.
[33:49.58]You killed him.
[33:53.14]What?
[33:53.32]Oh my god, the car is bouncing.
[33:54.75]I love when our molecules bounce together.
[33:57.35]Oh shit.
[33:59.79]Oh no.
[34:02.33]How did I not kill you guys?
[34:05.28]How did you not kill you guys?
[34:08.93]You tell me!
[34:10.43]You tell me!
[34:12.11]Why is he doing this?
[34:14.85]I can punish him.
[34:15.81]I can punish him!
[34:16.43]And I'm just crazy.
[34:18.21]How do I punish him?
[34:19.47]Now you're gonna watch and you're gonna like it.
[34:22.23]Yeah.
[34:22.33]Put on a good show.
[34:24.88]Put on a good show.
[34:32.68]It worked this time.
[34:39.99]I wonder if there's any flying camera right now spectating me, watching me live my life and doing the things he can't.
[34:45.90]Is that a fucking anti-tank gun?
[34:49.30]I hope to find his wife and marry her.
[34:54.10]If there was a ghost watching me, I'd probably fucking kill myself.
[34:58.20]If there's a ghost watching... Hey, can I give him any... Hey, I'm a ghost watching you.
[35:05.75]Oh, no, that's the wrong person.
[35:06.97]That's the wrong person.
[35:08.07]Whoops.
[35:14.08]I was gonna say this stupid fucking Joker meme line to everybody, and it would have been so bad.
[35:18.88]Wow, look at how much fun we're having.
[35:21.54]Us alive people.
[35:24.11]I'm gonna get him for that one.
[35:25.33]I'm gonna get him for that one.
[35:31.69]Ready one two three got it got him Why did you find out the hard way?
[35:59.13]Roll play along?
[35:59.89]Alright.
[36:00.89]Well, this time we're not going to do it for free.
[36:02.89]No, we are going to do it for free.
[36:03.73]I'm sorry, everybody.
[36:04.25]If we're going to be good at something, we're not going to do it for free.
[36:06.57]Is that it?
[36:07.43]Am I doing anything?
[36:10.59]Oh.
[36:11.29]Is that it?
[36:12.11]Is that it?
[36:14.50]So I'm either going to switch the map after this or have the teams rotate or something.
[36:19.99]Is there a way to auto shuffle teams after a certain amount of time?
[36:23.43]I have to restart the whole server and make it a round thing.
[36:26.07]We can do that.
[36:27.77]Round base.
[36:28.99]Hopefully we won't have to drop back into the menu.
[36:31.83]No more RDM.
[36:32.89]We got the RDM out of the way.
[36:35.13]Before I don't get invited ever again.
[36:36.91]I thought I'd try this first to see how this played out.
[36:39.68]Yeah, there's way more of us this time.
[36:42.78]We start server once this wraps up and I'll make it a round system again.
[36:47.36]I wasn't sure how this would work in this mode.
[36:49.92]Okay.
[36:50.28]I think we're switching servers.
[36:54.26]I could also just end it now.
[36:55.51]It depends on if Zyke's doing anything.
[36:58.45]End it?
[37:01.19]I think we should do more.
[37:02.07]Zyke is doing nothing right now.
[37:05.93]Now we're out of character.
[37:07.41]If he runs into someone right now, I won't restart it.
[37:09.91]He's going to make it, man.
[37:10.85]You guys are all going to have to leave.
[37:12.48]I have to leave.
[37:14.64]Okay, hold on.
[37:16.88]Hold on.
[37:19.56]Whoops.
[37:21.70]You guys can still hear them, but it's all good.
[37:28.64]Now you can just hear me.
[37:37.42]He's getting the... Oh, wait, wait.
[37:40.70]Wait.
[37:45.45]Is he doing it?
[37:48.11]He's doing it.
[37:51.86]Where is he?
[37:54.80]Where is he?
[37:55.32]Alright, we're changing servers, so it don't matter.
[38:01.35]Changing servers.
[38:04.69]Yeah, I'll turn the sound back on.
[38:06.35]I promise.
[38:08.03]I promise.
[38:08.56]Hey, is it, we doing the same, uh, same password?
[38:16.54]Cool, okay.
[38:18.92]Sweet.
[38:25.72]Alright, so... What's the... Turn the sound... I know the sound's up.
[38:38.79]We'll give it a second while we change servers.
[38:46.65]It's just one of those games where you just, like, fuck around.
[38:53.46]We should actually work together this next time.
[38:56.80]We're going to make it happen this next time.
[38:58.81]Just keep the sound off.
[39:02.61]What was the map we were just on?
[39:04.21]Does anybody know what it was called?
[39:09.31]What was the name of that map?
[39:10.82]Did anybody even catch it?
[39:12.00]I don't even know if I caught it.
[39:18.62]Don't make them hate you.
[39:21.74]No one's going to hate me.
[39:23.72]I did like the RDM joke once.
[39:25.60]We're good.
[39:29.33]It was mountainside.
[39:30.11]Okay.
[39:37.17]Go to PL upward.
[39:38.51]I guess now is the time I can read some bits.
[39:41.58]That would be a good idea, wouldn't it?
[39:44.96]Hey, Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[39:46.22]Rat intruder.
[39:49.72]That is me.
[39:51.31]Dark Maniac 2283, thanks for the 50 cents.
[39:53.27]Jerma, when you read my message yesterday, I broke a guitar string.
[39:55.73]Oh, that's not good.
[39:57.29]Hopefully you fixed it, because that sucks.
[40:02.17]Zahner, thanks for the $4.
[40:03.41]Welcome back, Zahner.
[40:05.03]Show DMs.
[40:05.83]I'm not going to show my DMs.
[40:10.72]Show DMs.
[40:16.22]Yeah, I know the sound is up.
[40:17.36]Don't worry.
[40:18.12]We'll fix it.
[40:21.60]Custy15, thanks for the $25.
[40:23.26]I only wish that you read my previous long message, not because I want you to notice me, but that I want you to understand the message.
[40:31.58]I truly wish I could give you more, but this is my limit.
[40:34.76]If you never read my message, I wish you someday understand that we give you money because we want to, because you deserve it.
[40:42.18]Well, thank you so much.
[40:48.51]You're never under any obligation.
[40:55.24]I don't want anyone to ever feel that way.
[40:57.40]But thank you so much for your extremely fucking generous money.
[41:05.26]Monetary donation.
[41:07.00]That's what it is.
[41:07.48]There's no other thing to call it.
[41:10.67]Some people say, thanks for the support.
[41:11.89]Thanks for the continued support.
[41:15.51]You're giving me money.
[41:16.33]You're giving me real fucking money.
[41:18.55]A lot of you guys do.
[41:20.77]Don't ever forget that.
[41:23.25]But I'm joining the server now, so give me a sec.
[41:28.42]You think I won't stay alive?
[41:30.92]How we doing?
[41:32.20]Uh, I think I'm gonna join... What team should I join?
[41:35.88]Join the fire team.
[41:38.42]Okay, let's get that in here.
[41:40.08]Alright.
[41:42.08]Alright, so... This is a different map.
[41:50.77]Hold on, hold on.
[41:51.29]This is dead.
[41:57.23]What what was that I'm not gonna turn the sound up.
[42:10.56]Why do you want me to turn up the sound I
[42:14.10]You can't fit through there, man.
[42:15.38]Hey, Tanto, Zuthar, can you guys give me an upvote on another character?
[42:19.04]You cannot.
[42:20.30]What have you done for me?
[42:22.94]You haven't done anything for me.
[42:25.29]A what?
[42:26.35]I'm taking away my upvote for you then.
[42:28.93]Yeah, go ahead.
[42:30.47]There's a voting system?
[42:31.81]I want to vote.
[42:32.91]Who do I vote for?
[42:33.63]I've got ten thumbs ups.
[42:35.53]I would please like a vote.
[42:36.77]I have none.
[42:38.26]Where?
[42:38.74]What?
[42:39.30]Where is it?
[42:40.38]Press escape, Zuthar.
[42:41.56]Is that you?
[42:45.84]I'm doing upvotes for upvotes.
[42:47.20]Who wants to trade me?
[42:48.58]Who's mine?
[42:50.40]Who's mine?
[42:51.34]Who's mine?
[42:51.68]I don't even know what... Look at that ping, baby.
[42:54.21]Look at that ping.
[42:56.75]37.
[42:56.97]Best in the world.
[42:59.39]Best in the world.
[43:04.76]Why would you want me to turn off the sound?
[43:06.42]That's the whole reason why we're playing, is to hear sounds.
[43:08.62]Can you get in cars?
[43:19.28]Is that a sniper?
[43:20.04]Yeah, that is a sniper rifle.
[43:22.36]That's beautiful.
[43:22.84]Alright, let's get a good view.
[43:23.58]Are you gonna get it?
[43:27.51]Are you gonna do it?
[43:29.21]Are you gonna get it?
[43:31.45]Come on, man.
[43:33.11]Snipe him.
[43:35.95]Snipe him.
[43:36.45]Crash.
[43:37.21]Dang it.
[43:38.08]Oh, he's out of ammo.
[43:38.94]He's gonna bleed out.
[43:42.04]Goodbye.
[43:43.70]Alright, elevator.
[43:46.12]This makes me think of a Gmod minigame.
[43:47.68]Yeah, it does.
[43:47.99]Do I not need the elevator?
[43:49.11]It's essentially the same thing.
[43:50.89]Holy shit, I can just restart the round.
[43:52.91]10?
[43:52.93]10 HP?
[43:55.87]Can you actually fit in there?
[43:59.79]Ah, gotta crawl.
[44:00.41]Alright, I'm gonna restart the round if it takes any longer to open up the fucking elevator door.
[44:09.33]You can't fit in, like, the rat hole.
[44:14.13]Turn off my mic so I have to speak in the game.
[44:16.61]I am speaking in the game.
[44:17.41]You guys wouldn't be able to hear me.
[44:20.33]People are raining from the sky.
[44:22.42]I can't speak in game.
[44:23.46]I'm dead.
[44:41.23]There's a fucking ten minutes to open up the elevator.
[44:43.75]Hey!
[44:44.53]I don't wanna crawl.
[44:47.85]Hey, huh?
[44:49.02]Crawl?
[44:50.80]Y'all wanna get in the elevator?
[44:52.02]C'mon.
[44:53.18]We all can fit in there.
[44:54.24]Alright, bye.
[44:57.88]C'mon.
[45:01.04]Is this elevator a wooden rollercoaster?
[45:02.83]Because that's what it sounds like.
[45:03.79]It does.
[45:07.45]I guess we'll see when we plummet to the bottom.
[45:11.79]I hate that.
[45:15.49]It's the worst feeling in the world.
[45:17.21]Don't want to leave him.
[45:19.43]We don't want to leave him behind.
[45:43.20]We did leave him behind.
[45:44.34]That wasn't nice.
[45:47.00]He doesn't know how to use the elevator.
[45:49.70]It's going to take him all day.
[45:52.66]You can go back down for me.
[45:54.84]I'm going to go back down because I want to be a team player.
[45:59.11]Oh!
[45:59.41]I guess I'm coming.
[46:00.79]That's why you need to wait a full three seconds before you try to get off an elevator.
[46:04.97]It's a phobia.
[46:05.51]Look it up.
[46:10.39]What in the fuck?
[46:12.41]He turned into... He turned into paper!
[46:14.23]In here?
[46:14.97]Is that him on the ground?
[46:16.29]Oh, wait, that's him.
[46:17.63]David, no, no!
[46:19.24]Alright, well... Alright, we're going back up.
[46:21.56]God damn it, no!
[46:22.78]He's doing a very poor job of stealing the briefcase.
[46:26.10]Who the hell is hitting the button?
[46:28.10]I'm not pressing the button.
[46:32.71]You guys want to go back down for me, or do you want to... Hello.
[46:35.61]Hello.
[46:36.53]Oh!
[46:39.90]I want to get off.
[46:42.78]I want to get off.
[46:43.48]I'm getting out of here.
[46:44.02]Good luck.
[47:10.11]Where are you going?
[47:10.59]What are you doing?
[47:11.80]Where are you going?
[47:13.44]Going in the fucking shaft.
[47:14.68]Alright, well, don't speak too... We're going to take the elevator down, and we're going to be on top.
[47:19.44]That's a great idea.
[47:20.66]That's a very good idea.
[47:21.52]Don't speak too softly.
[47:22.40]Don't speak too loudly.
[47:23.22]They're on the stairs.
[47:26.37]I saw them.
[47:28.61]They're... They're dead there.
[47:31.29]They're everywhere.
[47:32.27]I want to leave.
[47:32.99]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[47:34.41]Go first.
[48:05.13]Did that mean go?
[48:18.80]Did you mean go?
[48:24.24]I don't think there's anyone in this anymore.
[48:45.24]That person alive, I don't know if that person's alive What is that
[49:06.76]I was hit by three bullets.
[49:09.84]I'm an inside man.
[49:10.74]I was trying to stop them.
[49:13.40]Are you fixing the air conditioning?
[49:16.60]Yeah.
[49:17.50]Yes, that's my second job is to fix the air conditioning.
[49:21.23]But also... What's your first job?
[49:22.67]My first job was to steal a briefcase.
[49:25.69]But I was not... You hear that?
[49:29.25]That's what happens when you use cheap product.
[49:31.79]I was up there trying to fix that.
[49:33.47]That's what happens when you use cheap product.
[49:36.87]Nice.
[49:37.79]Nice.
[49:38.17]There you go.
[49:42.83]That was a total fool job, by the way.
[49:45.21]She had no idea.
[49:46.23]Oh, it was so easy.
[49:49.97]I wasn't even nervous.
[49:50.93]Oh, shit.
[49:51.30]They can't see me.
[50:11.42]Let's get that briefcase.
[50:16.07]Hold on.
[50:17.99]I got an idea.
[50:20.53]I got an idea.
[50:21.27]No, no.
[50:21.51]Go to the second floor.
[50:22.11]I got an idea.
[50:23.03]What is that?
[50:25.82]What's wrong with this elevator?
[50:27.98]What is going on with the elevator?
[50:29.58]Why?
[50:30.40]Why is this going so fast?
[50:38.98]Here we go.
[50:39.22]Let's... I'm gonna go... No, no.
[50:41.18]I gotta go back up.
[50:42.36]Get back up there.
[50:45.07]Second floor.
[50:46.25]Watch this.
[50:47.97]I'm gonna do some ventriloquist dummy shit here, guys.
[50:52.51]I'm gonna scream down a hallway and be like, I'm coming!
[50:54.93]And I'm gonna go the other way and I'm gonna get the briefcase.
[51:06.56]Hello?
[51:06.76]Hello?
[51:17.94]All my friends are dead.
[51:19.07]You better come get me at the elevator, you bastard!
[51:24.35]I hate elevators.
[51:25.21]I'd never go in one.
[51:26.39]How do I open the door?
[51:29.43]These are all locked.
[51:29.95]I don't know the code.
[51:33.68]It was a trick!
[51:35.80]Wait, no, I need that.
[51:41.60]If it's here, come get me at the stairs where the wood is, man!
[51:43.97]Okay, now I'm gonna get over here.
[51:48.92]Gonna go right in this door.
[51:50.20]Briefcase, where is it?
[51:51.12]Where's the briefcase?
[51:51.66]Where's the briefcase?
[51:52.22]Come on.
[51:52.44]Come on, where's that briefcase?
[52:06.59]Where is it?
[52:07.27]Ah, crap!
[52:08.73]Crap!
[52:11.00]Here he comes.
[52:16.42]Is it not in here?
[52:18.52]It's like the soda machines, that's not a brief- What the- Oh my god!
[52:24.59]Oh no.
[52:25.63]No.
[52:26.43]Wait.
[52:27.21]Oh, that was terrible.
[52:28.91]Oh no.
[52:31.13]Alright.
[52:35.63]This time, for sure.
[52:37.09]Shit.
[52:37.39]We're gonna go across the bridge.
[52:39.23]Let's not go on the elevator.
[52:40.15]So we'll at least get near the case.
[52:41.59]I didn't know there was a lot of space there.
[52:44.01]Ain't that right?
[52:45.61]Bad banana.
[52:47.23]Oh.
[52:49.87]Code played.
[52:50.59]5, 9, 6, 5.
[52:51.23]OK.
[52:51.63]5, 9, 6, 5.
[52:54.90]5, 9, 6, 5.
[52:56.88]We'll go ahead and peep in on the security.
[53:06.02]Good idea.
[53:06.34]We've got our best hacker on the job.
[53:09.23]Is that what he is?
[53:11.27]Name's Elliot.
[53:11.93]Can you please just get away from me?
[53:15.99]I want quiet.
[53:17.31]Sorry, sorry.
[53:18.43]Shit, did I say that out loud?
[53:20.27]Yeah, alright, let's go.
[53:22.11]Let's just go.
[53:23.03]We got our radios.
[53:24.57]If anybody needs to get in touch, we have our radios.
[53:27.78]Gotta get across the bridge.
[53:29.08]I got my radio.
[53:29.82]Make sure it works.
[53:31.98]Gonna be providing you cover from the cameras.
[53:35.00]Hacking in.
[53:35.58]Alright.
[53:36.80]Go main hallway.
[53:37.81]Main hallway.
[53:39.45]We're in the main hallway.
[53:43.58]Go across the bridge.
[53:44.44]Oh, just straight across?
[53:46.80]Through the main hall?
[53:48.47]Yeah.
[53:50.11]Alright, we're counting on you on this one.
[53:51.53]They got kind of locking, opening the lock.
[53:53.77]Wait, what?
[53:54.89]Turn off the sound.
[53:57.19]What sound?
[53:58.23]What are you guys hearing?
[53:59.58]Probably should not be walking like this.
[54:02.06]Open the door.
[54:02.76]Is there a flashlight that I need to know about?
[54:05.68]Oh, for fuck's sake.
[54:06.60]Hang on.
[54:08.78]That's about the extent I can help you with.
[54:11.02]I'm coming over there.
[54:12.02]They know my camera's there?
[54:12.90]You're an angel.
[54:15.44]I'm not an angel.
[54:16.20]Where'd they come from?
[54:19.92]There's some sick, twisted family.
[54:23.59]Oh shit, okay.
[54:24.49]Okay, never mind.
[54:25.79]Never mind.
[54:27.91]There's a family there?
[54:30.37]Okay.
[54:31.35]Shit, what's going on?
[54:40.08]Get me out.
[54:40.38]I'm hit.
[54:42.50]I'm hit.
[54:45.35]I'm hit.
[54:45.79]I'm hit.
[54:46.05]I'm hit.
[54:46.37]I'm hit.
[54:47.41]I'm hit.
[54:47.81]I'm hit.
[54:48.33]I'm hit.
[55:09.72]I wish I had a flashlight.
[55:10.74]Are all my friends dead?
[55:12.47]I landed in the water.
[55:14.81]Who's alive?
[55:15.53]Fucking God damn it.
[55:20.77]Is someone alive?
[55:24.09]Anyone?
[55:24.51]He's just on the cameras.
[55:25.99]He's only alive because he slipped.
[55:27.69]He's just on the cameras.
[55:30.15]Poetic.
[55:37.38]Fucking falling guy.
[55:41.88]I think that's a corpse.
[55:42.60]I think that's a corpse.
[55:45.14]I don't know where my son is.
[55:46.04]Are they children?
[55:47.40]Shane, shut up, sweetie.
[55:49.24]There's bad men.
[55:52.72]What the fuck is going on?
[55:53.56]I'll be superhero.
[55:55.24]No, Shane, don't do that.
[55:58.82]Shane, we're going to shoot some baddies, okay, sweetie?
[56:01.50]Superhero.
[56:03.27]He's going to get sniped.
[56:12.88]It's like art of these like the lighting is freaking me out Oh my god, yeah, he's gonna make it He's pulling a dolphin tactic I like it
[56:43.83]We're actually going to win.
[56:44.45]I like the very slow doggy paddle approach.
[56:48.36]Look at those legs move.
[56:49.74]He doesn't want to drop the briefcase.
[56:50.94]I mean, he's going to score.
[56:53.02]He's going to win it.
[56:54.12]We're going to win.
[56:54.50]We're going to get a touchdown here.
[56:55.38]We're going to get a TD.
[57:03.45]This is a slow process.
[57:08.45]See you later.
[57:09.25]Nice.
[57:10.58]They're shooting each other up here.
[57:18.46]Mommy's doing that near the end, but it's alright.
[57:20.65]Seems like it's okay now.
[57:41.42]Let's go outside.
[57:42.68]Ooh, yeah.
[57:43.62]We should split into two teams.
[57:45.14]Ooh, easy.
[57:45.44]We keep getting exploded.
[57:46.40]Thank god you didn't.
[57:57.10]Huh?
[57:57.40]What'd you say?
[57:57.90]I was busy.
[57:58.56]Let's put it into two so you guys go outside and then we watch the interior.
[58:02.80]This is outside team number one speaking on radio.
[58:07.02]I'm outside right now.
[58:07.98]I'm waiting for my teammate outside.
[58:09.49]So are we going to draw straws to determine who jumps out the window?
[58:14.67]I'm team captain for team outside.
[58:16.33]I'm going to go out and I'm just going to wait for someone else to come out.
[58:21.54]Fuck!
[58:22.98]How do you record this?
[58:25.16]I'll go.
[58:26.89]Just use his body as a stepping stool to get out there.
[58:30.77]There we go.
[58:31.23]Teamwork.
[58:31.57]We're already off to a good start.
[58:32.68]Let me help you.
[58:33.64]Maybe if I crouch down, you can jump on me.
[58:36.84]So... Nah, that hurt.
[58:38.04]Ow!
[58:52.38]Okay, team leader, what do we do?
[58:54.10]Here's what I want to do.
[58:55.08]I would like to go... I want to get back... Every time we... Follow me.
[58:58.62]Walk with me.
[58:58.96]Talk with me.
[59:00.68]But crouch, because we don't want to make a lot of noise.
[59:03.61]Every time we go together... Guys, do you read me?
[59:05.67]They're inside the building.
[59:06.45]They're inside the building.
[59:07.25]So this is what happens.
[59:08.01]They see us.
[59:08.85]They see us.
[59:11.71]It's under control.
[59:13.01]We can shoot them through the window.
[59:15.40]I heard something about noise.
[59:17.84]I'm taking a run for it.
[59:20.30]I don't want to be seen.
[59:21.48]We're going to support you from the outside.
[59:23.18]Okay.
[59:23.46]Whereabouts are they?
[59:24.28]In the house.
[59:24.68]Did you see them?
[59:25.20]What store?
[59:25.98]I think in the lobby.
[59:27.12]We're not in the house.
[59:28.74]Made in lobby.
[59:29.34]This one's really close.
[59:30.68]This one's really close.
[59:32.50]Hey, where am I?
[59:33.78]Thank you for the detailed information.
[59:36.14]They are to the right of the elevator.
[59:38.00]Yes, they are.
[59:38.66]They're going to be on the top floor in front of the elevator.
[59:42.81]Listen, we don't have to do it like this.
[59:44.79]We don't have to do it like this.
[59:46.87]We don't have to do it like this.
[59:47.89]We don't have to do it like this.
[59:49.23]We can do this.
[59:49.66]That sounds like a... Make sure that we don't... Let's be a trick.
[59:54.08]It's a trick.
[59:54.42]It's a trick.
[59:55.34]It's a trick.
[59:55.90]You just try to shoot me.
[59:57.02]And I didn't even try to shoot him.
[59:57.84]It's not a trick to stand.
[59:58.52]That's how you can tell when somebody's real.
[60:00.00]When they stand.
[60:13.64]Got him.
[60:13.94]Good, you got him and you turned him blue.
[60:15.80]It's captured, not killed.
[60:16.74]We got a bounty.
[60:18.30]Jackass in the bathroom.
[60:19.86]Nice, nice.
[60:20.86]Got it.
[60:42.93]Listen, listen, listen.
[60:46.09]I'm going to be the bait, okay?
[60:47.09]I'm going to walk in there.
[60:48.44]Don't follow me.
[60:51.12]Let him come out and get me.
[60:52.26]I'm willing to sacrifice myself.
[60:53.40]Oh, man.
[60:53.70]Understand.
[60:54.42]Yes.
[61:10.00]Alright, go.
[61:12.30]You guys just made me into the women's restroom.
[61:13.92]I actually think it might be the men's.
[61:16.04]I'm in the women's restroom and you guys did this to me.
[61:19.15]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[61:20.13]I went to the men's restroom and Zykes the creep.
[61:23.25]I can't think properly.
[61:26.23]Why don't we just run?
[61:28.19]What stall is he in?
[61:30.43]He's in the end one.
[61:32.05]He's in the end one on the side where I'm sitting in the window.
[61:34.57]We're going to be with you in a minute.
[61:36.62]He ain't even using the bathroom.
[61:37.72]This is bullshit.
[61:38.66]Anyone?
[61:39.28]There's
[61:41.59]Okay, I'm going in, okay?
[61:44.30]Ready?
[61:44.84]Middle door.
[61:45.40]Middle door.
[61:46.12]I see you too.
[61:50.08]No one's in here.
[61:50.82]You didn't open the door.
[61:52.94]Open the door.
[61:53.42]You gotta open the middle door.
[61:56.86]He's probably doing a spider technique.
[61:58.38]You've never done that before?
[61:59.36]You never sit in front of the toilet and make it so nobody can see you?
[62:02.53]Of course I'm sitting on the toilet.
[62:06.63]You don't want to know what he's doing in there.
[62:08.75]I don't care.
[62:09.09]It's nothing I've never seen before.
[62:13.12]Jesus Christ!
[62:16.38]You killed him!
[62:17.14]I'm searching every goddamn bathroom and I don't see anyone.
[62:19.38]That was such a knee jerk reaction.
[62:37.83]Nintendo was skyrocketing, so I sold them all.
[62:41.77]You have to be careful with those chairs.
[62:46.08]They vibrate.
[62:48.24]I'm the chairman.
[62:53.82]Chairman, there's somebody at the door for you.
[62:55.55]I'm on the other team.
[62:57.97]Okay.
[63:01.27]With him distracted, I can hack into the computer.
[63:03.11]We got some real scumbags.
[63:05.91]Blowing up the data.
[63:09.59]Excuse me, Mr. Hacker?
[63:11.17]Someone's on line one.
[63:12.31]Shit, did I say that out loud?
[63:13.54]We have radios too.
[63:15.54]Someone's looking for you.
[63:20.32]Full auto, guys.
[63:21.20]There's no one there.
[63:23.48]Don't take any chances.
[63:24.30]If you need to spray a lot, make sure you hit them.
[63:27.53]Full auto.
[63:28.35]No, come on.
[63:34.75]Someone's out there for you.
[63:35.71]You should go check it out.
[63:36.57]Again?
[63:42.72]Alright.
[63:43.38]I just wanted a better view.
[63:44.38]Okay.
[63:46.84]Do you have a game plan for breaking that window?
[63:50.02]Do you see anyone on that cliff?
[63:53.57]Oh, I've got a game plan.
[63:56.17]I'm just following orders.
[63:57.25]He told me to do that.
[63:59.09]Alright.
[64:00.45]Hang on.
[64:04.53]That's the plan.
[64:05.03]We're going to grind on these rails.
[64:10.02]Until we are satisfied.
[64:15.97]God, that's satisfying.
[64:22.02]Man.
[64:24.06]Let's raise the stakes.
[64:25.52]Easy, easy, easy, easy.
[64:28.40]Watch out, don't fall out of there.
[64:31.66]Let me see.
[64:32.81]Yeah, I can smell him.
[64:35.65]600 meters to the left.
[64:37.49]That would be this way.
[64:48.51]Yeah.
[64:49.57]Ah, hold on.
[64:52.63]They're in here.
[64:55.92]Fuck.
[64:56.72]Right down there.
[64:57.28]Be careful.
[64:58.22]Check this out.
[64:58.68]Check this out, guys.
[64:59.26]I'm going to jump from here to the middle railing.
[65:01.78]Right there.
[65:04.10]See the shadow?
[65:04.98]Yeah.
[65:07.32]Yeah, I'm going for it.
[65:09.70]Oh, shit.
[65:10.12]Okay, one by one we'll get in there.
[65:12.08]Okay, okay, okay.
[65:12.66]I'm going in.
[65:16.02]Oh, what's going on?
[65:21.67]Perfect.
[65:25.39]No, sorry.
[65:26.53]I think that was a plant that I was seeing.
[65:29.21]And smelling.
[65:31.53]No, it wasn't.
[65:32.31]See, boys, I told you.
[65:33.51]I got the scent of a dog.
[65:34.67]Come on, follow me.
[65:35.57]I think I see someone breaking into the front.
[65:38.47]Front door.
[65:39.27]No, it's this back door.
[65:40.57]No, this way.
[65:41.05]Is this the front?
[65:41.63]Okay.
[65:42.53]Scent of a dog.
[65:44.25]On your six.
[65:44.75]On your six.
[65:45.79]Scent of a dog, guys.
[65:48.18]You wanna- we're gonna- Alright, hang on, I got this.
[65:50.46]Told you.
[65:51.12]Hang on, hang on, I got this.

[65:54.14]Alright, we're good.
[65:56.72]We're good.
[65:58.24]Yeah!

[66:00.10]Where are they?
[66:00.66]Where are they, boy?
[66:01.46]Where are they, boy?
[66:01.97]Where are they?
[66:02.59]Go, get him!
[66:02.93]Get him!
[66:04.89]I got one, guys.
[66:05.77]They're just like shooting fish in a barrel.
[66:07.97]Come on, boys.
[66:12.05]Come on.
[66:14.27]Over here?
[66:14.81]Through the hole?
[66:17.10]That's a chicken wait in here
[66:45.30]Guys, I'm on a lot of drugs right now.
[66:49.12]I'm not entirely sure what we're doing.
[66:51.08]No way.
[66:56.26]Are we on a mission right now?
[66:59.68]Wait, wait!
[67:01.82]Come on, boy.
[67:02.34]Come on.
[67:05.38]Three, two, one.
[67:07.80]Open door.
[67:08.16]Go.
[67:08.52]In here.
[67:08.90]This door.
[67:09.95]Freeze!
[67:10.19]Fuck!
[67:16.11]This way second floor second floor freezing hey freeze on the second you're on the second floor freeze Excuse me freeze
[67:37.94]Scumbags.
[67:48.03]All of them.
[67:50.75]Literally, if you go to the FDA website and click on drugs, everyone that's listed.
[67:57.56]Even the over-the-counter shit.
[68:00.02]We're talking like Tylenol and Advil.
[68:04.34]All of them.
[68:12.59]Alright, I like to play a game called Marco Polo, right?
[68:15.19]If you can't find anybody where they are and your sense is a little off, shoot in the air and they'll hear it and they'll react to it.
[68:21.09]So on the count of three... On the count of three... You're like the guy that when we buy the fireworks, we talk about lighting the fire... Behind us!
[68:34.16]Jesus!
[68:35.88]Oh shit, he's dead!
[68:37.34]The dog is dead!
[68:42.35]Wake him up!
[68:43.17]Oh, shit.
[68:44.23]Oh, shit.
[68:44.75]Centipede Dog is dead and other guys... Oh.
[68:48.75]Oh, God.
[68:49.52]It worked.
[68:50.66]Oh, God.
[68:51.20]I need immediate help.
[68:58.34]Leave our nest immediately and you will live.
[69:03.46]Fuck you!
[69:06.66]He did it.
[69:06.98]No, he didn't.
[69:08.26]Easy!
[69:14.40]I think we lose.
[69:16.50]What I was trying to say is when you're playing with fireworks, if it's legal, if you're in a legal state of supervision, there's always that guy that can't wait and pulls them all out and starts lighting them off before everybody can have any fun.
[69:29.43]That's what I was going to say.
[69:35.10]Oh, who hurt you?
[69:37.02]I had a bad dream that I got lost.
[69:40.55]left behind and then killed on the roof of a building after getting arrested.
[69:45.47]They came back to put me down afterwards.
[69:52.01]Let's go, boys.
[69:56.43]Come on!
[69:59.73]What?
[70:02.55]Okay.
[70:03.19]My Discord's not even open.
[70:06.49]Somebody playing the piano?
[70:10.47]My Discord's not open, I swear to God!
[70:23.25]What the...?
[70:23.63]Is that...?
[70:24.19]Alright, we're gonna go down this way?
[70:28.46]Aye aye aye.
[70:31.06]I can't hear them anymore, I can't hear the music!
[70:32.68]Oh, I hate that.
[70:34.18]Yeah, I can't hear it either.
[70:36.31]I really don't like dunking like this.
[70:40.69]Why can't I stay above the water?
[70:45.78]Let me stay below the water.
[70:47.48]It's that much better.
[70:50.48]I mean, I'm alright now.
[70:53.84]I mean, give it a couple seconds.
[71:04.90]How'd you get up?
[71:05.46]How do I get up?
[71:06.14]There's a ramp over here.
[71:08.90]Everyone, regroup.
[71:09.58]Regroup.
[71:11.90]Uh... Is there a ladder?
[71:13.44]Oh, boy.
[71:14.92]A ramp on this side.
[71:17.30]Lovely.
[71:20.28]So, what's the game plan?
[71:23.02]Because, uh, you know, we were supposed to guard a briefcase up in that building, and now we're down here.
[71:28.41]Stop the sounds.
[71:29.39]We're being proactive about the mission.
[71:30.97]You ever heard a song called Sweet Home on the Range?
[71:36.02]I want to throw a grenade so bad.
[71:39.98]Oh, I want to throw a grenade right now, but I... I...
[72:18.64]Where am I?
[72:19.86]What's going on?
[72:21.82]What's happening?
[72:22.40]Oh, there's the ladder.
[72:23.09]Okay, I'm fine.
[72:23.49]I ain't getting blown up in the elevator.
[72:28.27]It's gonna happen.
[72:29.99]See?
[72:31.79]I told you.
[72:33.66]The elevator's gonna explode.
[72:34.66]Hang on, I'll just open the door.
[72:35.88]I can just... Run.
[72:39.55]No, don't go.
[72:42.19]Wait, play Imagine Dragons, um... I'm gonna scare the shit out of him.
[72:45.63]God, that song is so awesome.
[72:48.33]Play it on repeat.
[72:51.33]Oh, it's just silent.
[72:54.17]I like you.
[72:55.21]Me too.
[72:55.47]What was that?
[73:00.58]They don't even know that I'm not there.
[73:08.62]They like don't know I'm not there.
[73:19.83]Why are we still in the elevator?
[73:22.75]Why are we still in the elevator?
[73:23.75]Are we out of the elevator?
[73:24.55]Are we in the elevator?
[73:27.62]I would know if we were in the elevator or not.
[73:29.06]Why am I saying that?
[73:31.04]Oh fuck, am I stuck up here?
[73:32.60]How do I get out of here?
[73:34.78]They left.
[73:35.16]Isn't there a way to open this?
[73:38.96]How do I open this door?
[73:41.84]Can I like, can I punch?
[73:42.70]What is this?
[73:43.94]I don't know what this is.
[73:44.52]This is like, this is a garage door opener.
[73:47.08]Oh boy.
[73:47.70]Okay, that's a bomb.
[73:49.04]Whoa!
[73:49.80]Pick it up.
[73:52.52]Alright.
[73:53.28]Where's like the open the door?
[73:55.51]There's a trap door here somewhere.
[73:56.55]Where is it?
[74:02.13]Hello, are any enemies on the radio?
[74:07.51]I'm here.
[74:07.99]Can you hear me?
[74:09.75]Oh, damn it.
[74:10.69]Oh, yeah.
[74:10.99]What happened to you?
[74:11.87]You were all singing, and then I blacked out.
[74:15.32]Yeah.
[74:16.42]I got on top somehow.
[74:20.52]Oh, if you got on top, you got to go down a little bit, and there's little hatches that you can... Here, I'm actually there at the hatch.
[74:29.98]Oh, you're at the hatch.
[74:32.55]Yeah, I'm like, if you go into the shaft, there's like a little part that you can get onto that has an open door.
[74:38.18]I'm at it like right now.
[74:39.44]You can't miss me.
[74:40.10]I'll catch you.
[74:43.60]Did you just fall all the way down to the bottom?
[74:46.02]I heard a scream.
[74:50.43]I see the enemies.
[74:51.67]I see the enemies there.
[74:53.25]Are you guys all in the elevator there?
[74:57.01]No, we're good.
[74:58.63]No, no, no, no.
[75:00.15]I'm stuck in the fucking shaft.
[75:02.95]I thought I was on the other team.
[75:04.55]No, I definitely need a baby.
[75:07.63]Let me come back.
[75:08.35]I'm on my way.
[75:09.57]I thought that was the other team.
[75:10.73]That's why I was fucking quiet.
[75:12.31]I'm stuck in the service shaft.
[75:19.73]Explosion down to the lobby.
[75:21.19]I'm sort of hungry.
[75:23.13]I want a snack.
[75:29.47]If someone sends an elevator up, I can just climb in, but if no one does that, I'm going to die down here.
[75:34.62]I got you.
[75:35.10]I got you.
[75:37.72]Okay.
[75:39.68]Elevator moving.
[75:41.80]Alright.
[75:42.38]I'm going to catch it and grab on.
[75:44.99]Are you good?
[75:46.81]I'm in.
[75:48.47]I'm taking hits.
[75:49.13]I'm taking hits.
[75:49.63]I need a medic.
[75:50.25]I got the briefcase.
[75:50.85]Hold on.
[75:52.85]Alright.
[75:53.11]I'm here.
[75:53.39]I'm here.
[75:53.73]What's the situation?
[75:55.66]What?
[75:55.82]Take the stairs.
[75:56.90]Alright, let's cause a little fucking chaos.
[75:58.90]What do you guys say?
[76:01.20]I'm just gonna- I'm not gonna watch this, ready?
[76:03.35]No one's gonna get hurt by this.
[76:07.19]I'm just gonna scare the fuck out of everybody.
[76:28.85]Why did that happen?
[76:30.58]Who threw that?
[76:37.04]I'm not dead.
[76:41.46]I'm not dead.
[76:41.92]It was a chain reaction.
[76:43.68]From what?
[76:44.48]Other grenades?
[76:47.70]Where is that snake man that was on the ceiling?
[76:50.25]I think he just slid away.
[76:53.09]It's a goblin.
[76:53.93]It was a blue goblin.
[76:59.75]I got him, he's dead.
[77:00.89]We win.
[77:01.95]Nice.
[77:02.97]Wait, no we don't.
[77:04.25]There's still one left.
[77:07.05]Could be anywhere.
[77:07.80]Ah, I slipped!
[77:10.00]Sorry, it was just a stun grenade.
[77:13.82]No, I keep slipping.
[77:16.78]I see him.
[77:17.36]I got eyes on him.
[77:19.30]I got eyes on him.
[77:19.88]You got him?
[77:22.00]Yep, I see him.
[77:23.32]He's right there.
[77:25.42]Got eyes.
[77:26.18]Alright, take him down.
[77:27.25]Take him down.
[77:27.83]Take him down?
[77:28.57]Take the shot?
[77:29.17]Yeah, take him down.
[77:29.79]Take the shot.
[77:30.35]Take the shot.
[77:33.15]I got him.
[77:34.83]He's dead.
[77:36.59]That one was already dead.
[77:39.13]There's one still up there.
[77:43.93]Fucking goblins.
[77:44.73]Hey, fuck you.
[77:45.31]Come down here.
[77:46.15]Hey, fuck you.
[77:47.03]Fucking roof goblin.
[77:48.05]Fuck you, leather man.
[77:54.66]Fuck yeah, you did it.
[77:56.56]You dirty Yanks, lose!
[78:01.40]Are we fighting leprechauns?
[78:03.04]It's like, overwhelming.
[78:10.17]This is a tiebreaker, so... How long do you guys think you can hold a note?
[78:16.09]Okay, I'll go first.
[78:17.39]No, no, wait, wait, we gotta go first.
[78:19.35]No, just a single note, and we're gonna sprint outside, and we're gonna hold the note, and just shoot everybody.
[78:25.12]Wait, wait, hold on.
[78:27.34]Don't do it now, don't do it now.
[78:28.66]You're gonna run out of gas.
[78:30.91]We all do different notes, and then it sounds really good, and they're intimidated by our melodies.
[78:40.08]He's still going.
[78:42.60]Very good.
[78:43.10]This is not what I thought was going to happen.
[78:45.64]What?
[78:45.78]Ow.
[78:45.84]Ow.
[78:46.00]Ow.
[78:46.10]Ow.
[78:46.24]Why can I not get up?
[79:12.04]I'm gonna pretend to be dead.
[79:14.22]Who's alive?
[79:15.28]Sound up!
[79:16.08]It's okay.
[79:16.32]I'm still alive.
[79:18.41]I'm gonna pretend to be dead.
[79:19.45]I see them both.
[79:20.39]I'm dead.
[79:22.45]Fucking damn it.
[79:23.41]For fuck's sake, I keep... Hands up.
[79:27.05]That's right.
[79:27.98]Here we go.
[79:28.80]Let's see you.
[79:29.28]We're gonna get the revenge of the evening.
[79:31.84]Ready?
[79:31.98]Here we go.
[79:38.13]EEEEEE!
[79:39.13]What? I'm dead. What? What? What?
[79:50.13]Mountain pass?
[80:00.11]Jesus Christ.
[80:05.11]What fucking insanity.
[80:09.11]They checked, so right when I pressed the button as I got shot.
[80:12.01]Let's go water.
[80:16.19]Water, Earth, fire, wind, combined, we have the... Oh, oh, dead, dead teammates, dead teammates.
[80:26.95]Hey, look, it's snowing.
[80:31.17]Are those sodas down there?
[80:35.04]I think that's just champagne.
[80:36.68]Do you want to kick back a little bit?
[80:38.68]It's two of us.
[80:39.40]I mean, everyone else is dead.
[80:40.82]Let's give it a try.
[80:41.84]I mean, it seems like it's fate.
[80:48.83]It kind of hurts coming down here, but hey, cheers, man.
[80:59.05]Cheers, man.
[81:02.29]Cheers.
[81:04.63]Well, for me.
[81:10.95]You want a drink?
[81:17.17]Not very good border patrol.
[81:18.91]Probably the worst.
[81:23.95]Uh, it's a good try.
[81:27.57]Alright, everyone, I expect some good, clean fun out here, okay?
[81:30.01]Border patrol.
[81:31.26]Imagine, like, somebody's trying to cross the border.
[81:32.96]Hey, you want a drink, man?
[81:33.84]That means I mean business.
[81:36.20]Oh, he means business.
[81:36.88]Are you the leader?
[81:37.52]Alright, go ahead.
[81:38.28]What are you doing?
[81:39.76]Uh, we're gonna go out this door.
[81:40.94]Alright, now I promote you to leader.
[81:46.61]You, right there.
[81:47.65]Alright, everybody.
[81:49.15]Now we come out the door.
[81:49.97]Our next task is to jump on this floor without dying.
[81:52.89]Ready?
[81:53.29]Let's do it.
[81:56.58]Didn't even break a sweat.
[81:58.40]You pass, you pass, you pass.
[82:01.24]Nope, he fails actually.
[82:02.62]I revoked.
[82:03.44]He fails.
[82:04.04]He fails?
[82:05.80]Yeah, he didn't make it.
[82:06.92]You're the new leader.
[82:07.76]Go ahead.
[82:08.60]Okay.
[82:09.10]Well, in that case, we're going to walk very slowly to the stop sign that's up here.
[82:14.86]If anybody fires a gun, they're in big trouble.
[82:21.03]Excuse me!
[82:24.15]Who fired the gun?
[82:26.25]It was number two.
[82:27.17]Number two fires a gun, huh?
[82:28.60]It was not me.
[82:29.66]Number two.
[82:31.34]Wait a minute, that would make you number two.
[82:34.06]No, he was number two.
[82:35.46]You appointed him as the leader.
[82:36.80]I was number one.
[82:37.90]I was number one.
[82:38.36]That means you must be number two.
[82:39.36]You're number three.
[82:39.84]You're number four.
[82:40.32]Number four hasn't said a word.
[82:41.36]What's going on here, spy?
[82:42.36]Um, no, nothing.
[82:44.78]I just had nothing to contribute.
[82:46.54]It's my first day.
[82:47.30]I'm sorry.
[82:48.40]Okay, I'm nervous.
[82:51.60]They wouldn't take that answer at the academy.
[82:53.66]Shape up.
[82:56.48]Follow me.
[82:58.12]If I get hit by one single bullet, watch the rocks.
[83:06.09]You did that again.
[83:09.29]Number four.
[83:09.69]That wasn't me.
[83:12.23]Number four.
[83:12.81]Look at that gun in you.
[83:13.79]Oh, no, there is no gun in your hand, so it must have been number... You're the only one with a gun.
[83:19.38]Yeah, yeah, but I'm just on alert, you know?
[83:22.34]It was him.
[83:23.70]It wasn't me.
[83:24.28]This is ridiculous.
[83:26.10]I'm being framed.
[83:27.24]I'm being framed.
[83:28.23]Alright.
[83:28.61]Then just keep following me.
[83:30.31]This time I'm going to be able to look.
[83:31.61]You played red light, green light?
[83:34.13]Yes, sir.
[83:34.57]It's constantly red light, but I get to see.
[83:36.43]So it doesn't matter.
[83:37.43]No, no, no.
[83:38.79]It's green light.
[83:39.57]Green light, but constantly red light because I'm turned around.
[83:42.01]But it's green.
[83:43.15]It's green.
[83:43.97]So yellow light.
[83:44.57]Yellow light.
[83:46.58]Look, look, look, look, look, look.
[83:47.78]All the way up.
[83:48.54]All the way up.
[83:48.84]You see the sniper?
[83:51.04]Sir, they're just trying to kill us.
[83:53.30]I got this.
[83:55.18]Good thinking, sir.
[83:56.24]Good grenade, sir.
[83:57.92]Yes!
[83:58.82]And they're gone.
[83:59.62]Got him.
[84:01.64]Shrapnel hit him.
[84:03.27]Keep moving this way.
[84:08.37]Number four, what's the matter?
[84:12.56]Number four, I mean, are you seeing things now, number four?
[84:17.10]Guys, you know, come on.
[84:18.36]Number four, if boss says there's no boys, there's no boys, number four, you're crazy.
[84:21.77]Come on, let's go.
[84:22.37]No, but there's at least, there's at least four that, that, right there.
[84:26.89]Where?
[84:27.29]What are you looking at here?
[84:29.04]I see the rabbit, but I don't, what about, besides the rabbit?
[84:33.48]A grain of dirt?
[84:33.96]Yeah.
[84:34.28]I don't see it.
[84:39.06]Well, I mean, yeah, that's a rabbit.
[84:40.74]That's a rabbit.
[84:41.76]They think I'm a rabbit.
[84:43.46]They think I'm a rabbit, guys.
[84:47.40]I see more rabbits over there.
[84:51.42]Yeah, there are quite a few rabbits back there.
[84:53.36]You're right.
[84:59.30]See, it's even making the rabbit noises.
[85:01.56]That's the rabbit stomp.
[85:03.62]That rabbit's not what he thinks he is.
[85:05.66]That robot almost killed me.
[85:08.48]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[85:09.38]Hold on a second.
[85:10.36]A rabbit almost killed you, cadet?
[85:12.08]Okay.
[85:12.48]That rabbit sent me into the nether.
[85:14.44]You gotta believe me, boss.
[85:15.36]He's not what he thinks.
[85:16.02]He's not what he says he is.
[85:17.26]And, oh, next you're gonna tell me that all horses can talk.
[85:20.23]This guy... What was that over here?
[85:29.05]Look, giant rabbit.
[85:30.17]Whoa, look at that.
[85:30.77]This is the biggest rabbit I've ever seen.
[85:34.25]What is that?
[85:36.37]Oh, this is the rabbit's nest, yeah.
[85:37.59]Rabbit apparatus.
[85:39.98]Ew, ow.
[85:41.64]Ouchies, whoa.
[85:42.86]I think the rabbit just bit my leg.
[85:44.11]That was cute.
[85:46.95]What a silly, funny rabbit.
[85:52.73]Ooh, wait, this one's quick.
[85:57.90]Guys, they think I'm a fucking rabbit.
[85:59.28]They're so stupid.
[86:00.12]I'm blowing them up with an artillery cannon right now.
[86:02.44]Did you hear those cute noises?
[86:06.99]Anybody got an iPhone?
[86:10.07]Don't extract me.
[86:11.05]I'm murdering them and they're feeding me.
[86:12.81]You know what else is really fun to do?
[86:15.75]Slaughtering rabbits!
[86:19.79]Let's cook this motherfucker and eat him.
[86:25.59]I want this part.
[86:26.39]The neck.
[86:30.11]I don't feel so well.
[86:31.31]Excuse me.
[86:32.51]Can I go back?
[86:36.23]You watch me eat this rabbit.
[86:38.75]Yes, sir.
[86:40.43]You watch me eat this rabbit, and you're gonna say, yes, sir.
[86:44.61]Yes, sir.
[86:45.37]Thank you.
[86:45.67]Let me get the best part here.
[86:57.26]Get the ligaments.
[87:00.54]How's it taste, sir?
[87:04.86]How do you think it tastes?
[87:07.26]Fucking delicious, right, sir?
[87:08.91]No, it doesn't.
[87:09.53]It tastes terrible.
[87:10.19]But sometimes you make sacrifices.
[87:14.57]Sometimes you don't get to eat for three days.
[87:17.51]Sometimes all you get to eat is maggoty bread.
[87:19.93]For three days.
[87:21.37]It's awful.
[87:22.27]Uh-huh.
[87:24.58]You make sacrifices.
[87:25.50]Keep following me.
[87:31.92]Cadet 4!
[87:32.20]Huh?
[87:39.14]That's you.
[87:40.24]Step forward.
[87:40.68]I want you to examine this box.
[87:41.72]What's in this box?
[87:43.48]Okay.
[87:44.26]Um, well... It's a gun, sir.
[87:50.31]That's my gun.
[87:51.53]I put it there for a reason.
[87:52.43]It's your gun.
[87:53.59]Okay.
[87:54.65]Sometimes you bury your... Sometimes you bury your treasure.
[87:57.85]You understand?
[87:58.29]Just like a rabbit would.
[87:59.59]Okay.
[88:00.47]Okay.
[88:01.91]I did that there for a test for you.
[88:03.45]And you know what?
[88:03.89]You failed it.
[88:04.83]What you were supposed to do was supposed to say, Captain, go get your own gun.
[88:08.44]And go...
[88:13.95]It's a goddamn elephant!
[88:19.12]It's just an elephant!
[88:19.98]Everybody calm down!
[88:23.02]It's just an elephant!
[88:27.50]You did a very good job.
[88:32.66]This is all about the animals.
[88:33.60]It's all about... Don't worry about it.
[88:37.26]The lesson is complete from here.
[88:39.86]That was clearly an elephant.
[88:40.76]Did you not hear the elephant sound?
[88:48.07]I hope I don't lose you here.
[88:50.89]This is war.
[88:52.07]It's humans versus animals.
[88:56.66]Baby in the grass.
[88:59.44]That sounds like a baby bird.
[89:00.46]Just use your skills and let's track it.
[89:03.48]Where is it?
[89:20.22]Oh, it's over here.
[89:24.67]Wow.
[89:26.77]Oh, wow.
[89:27.23]Okay, I do see now.
[89:28.27]Okay.
[89:28.39]What do you think we should do?
[89:32.01]I mean, this is clearly... I...
[89:48.48]It was very clear that that was a fucking... That was a baby raccoon!
[89:52.19]Oldest trick in the fucking book!
[89:53.89]The oldest trick!
[89:54.29]Baby raccoon with a gun!
[89:55.31]It's a baby raccoon with a gun.
[89:58.67]Sometimes it happens.
[89:59.53]Alright, who's the new captain?
[90:06.89]Oh, we're all going down this tiny tube together?
[90:09.22]Yeah, whoever doesn't fit can't come.
[90:13.22]Hell yeah!
[90:14.24]Whoever can't fit down there?
[90:15.58]Squeeze down, boys!
[90:18.27]Oh, yeah.
[90:22.23]Oh, that suddenly broke his neck.
[90:24.63]I'll fit in there.
[90:25.23]Watch.
[90:29.46]Now what?
[90:30.22]That's an image I'll never delete from my brain.
[90:34.28]And a big red button for when we flush.
[90:38.82]That's not a button.
[90:41.03]Are we locked down here now?
[90:43.45]Yeah, this is not meant for...
[90:46.09]How do I get on the ground and put my face in the dirt?
[90:51.49]Oh, that's a good vantage point.
[90:54.79]Gotta think of an alternate way of getting down.
[90:58.28]Hey, good way of thinking about it without breaking our pee.
[91:03.52]Bring back Grandpa.
[91:04.72]You want to do Grandpa?
[91:08.00]Alright, I will.
[91:10.90]Fine.
[91:11.29]It's just hard for me to get through here.
[91:19.30]Somebody just got shot in the fucking head.
[91:21.20]Get over here, get over here.
[91:25.14]They might have a sniper.
[91:28.32]Oh, God.
[91:29.18]Oh, shit.
[91:29.96]There's definitely a sniper over there somewhere.
[91:32.34]Somewhere down to the right.
[91:33.68]Okay.
[91:33.80]Do you want me to double check or are we certain?
[91:36.56]I'll triple check.
[91:37.42]Ready?
[91:38.34]Watch this.
[91:40.34]One.
[91:41.65]Two.
[91:43.38]Three.
[91:44.30]Remember, as long as you don't see the whites in their eyes, it means they can't hit you.
[91:50.02]There's a guy right over there to the left.
[91:51.22]I saw him.
[91:52.86]He's right across from this weird Lego building.
[91:55.22]I'm getting shot at.
[91:56.20]What?
[91:57.12]This thing is right how you snap the fingers and you go point forward.
[92:00.01]There's one behind the rock.
[92:04.89]I'm coming.
[92:06.29]He's dead.
[92:09.23]You okay?
[92:10.64]No!
[92:12.46]They can't hear me.
[92:13.02]Where the fuck was he?
[92:13.76]Yeah, you gotta rush him.
[92:14.66]Back to hell, grandpa.
[92:17.28]What are they doing?
[92:35.92]No, no one's pulling out of anything.
[92:38.30]What are you doing to me?
[92:39.92]Shut up!
[92:41.00]Just to get the gun out.
[92:44.06]Are they on the same team?
[92:46.12]These guys are on the same team.
[92:55.06]No, not another, like, I am a baby.
[92:58.04]Oh, I thought they were doing, like, another baby thing.
[93:06.49]He's still alive.
[93:08.85]They don't even know.
[93:12.09]Got him.
[93:12.90]Nice.
[93:14.28]What are you doing in here?
[93:16.62]I think they were both fainting.
[93:19.22]What a fucking asshole.
[93:20.34]You know what I mean?
[93:21.54]You know what I mean?
[93:23.06]You know what I mean?
[93:24.04]What a fucking dickhead.
[93:25.56]You tried to, yeah.
[93:28.88]Well, I got him.
[93:29.56]I saved you.
[93:30.32]And now you owe me your life.
[93:32.64]I'm not out of the game yet, you son of a bitch.
[93:35.55]You're gonna be if you hop down here.
[93:37.23]I wouldn't do that.
[93:38.73]I'll catch you.
[93:39.95]I'll catch you.
[93:40.77]I'm just gonna come up and shoot you, I think.
[93:42.67]No, I'll catch you.
[93:43.53]Don't listen to him.
[93:45.63]No, come on, man.
[93:48.61]These games are fucking out of control.
[93:54.54]Trying to get the disk up there.
[93:55.88]Ah, there's one.
[93:58.36]Two discs?
[94:00.16]He doesn't even know.
[94:01.26]Doesn't even know he's on the ground.
[94:02.74]Coming around the corner right now.
[94:04.68]Don't even know.
[94:13.74]Just one, like, right in the skull.
[94:18.51]They're over there now.
[94:21.07]He's playing this with heart.
[94:22.35]He's doing this for real.
[94:34.79]Where are they?
[94:35.93]Where the fuck are they?
[94:37.07]He's sitting in a fucking closet.
[94:43.79]This is just hide-and-go-seek, except everybody tries to go like the roundabout way to do everything.
[94:50.57]It's fucking funny.
[94:52.83]It's so funny.
[94:54.95]They're literally walking around in a circle.
[94:56.77]They're ring-around-the-rosing right now.
[94:58.23]They don't even know.
[94:58.81]Why haven't you found me yet?
[95:05.36]But there is still one hiding in the closet, Connor.
[95:07.98]You never stood a chance.
[95:09.96]I'll do like one or two more.
[95:12.18]And that's gonna be it for me.
[95:13.24]This time is personal.
[95:14.44]This time we're the intruders.
[95:16.06]I'm gonna let all you guys go first this time.
[95:18.38]Does that sound good?
[95:21.13]Sure.
[95:21.37]Take no prisoners this time.
[95:22.77]For real.
[95:24.99]Like, I'm tired of... I'm not gonna fucking roleplay this time.
[95:27.77]I'm just gonna kill some motherfuckers.
[95:30.45]If I see someone in my sights, they're gonna go down.
[95:33.37]I like it.
[95:33.95]Let's do it.
[95:40.42]No games.
[95:42.63]No fun.
[95:44.07]Launch that in there.
[95:45.17]Who wants to get on the mortar and lay us down some supporting fire?
[95:50.65]I got the shield just in case they turn.
[95:52.59]What is this?
[95:53.29]Is it a car key?
[95:55.05]Anyone want to man this pup?
[96:11.76]I'll take a few pot shots with it, maybe.
[96:13.09]Hell yeah.
[96:16.39]Give it a shot.
[96:19.11]Give him hell.
[96:20.27]Give him hell.
[96:21.67]Hear that?
[96:22.47]That sounded like hell.
[96:23.63]Let's do it again.
[96:24.97]Oh, fuck yeah.
[96:25.89]They're equipping him in little booties by now, probably.
[96:29.18]He's giving him hell.
[96:30.02]Let's see if we can give him some more hell.
[96:34.06]Good spot.
[96:35.58]Give him some hell.
[96:37.72]Give him some hell.
[96:38.76]That's a good trajectory there.
[96:42.18]Give it to him.
[96:42.86]Come on.
[96:43.66]Give it to him.
[96:44.40]Watch that one.
[96:45.42]Whoa.
[96:46.54]Listen.
[96:47.00]Listen.
[96:49.25]Ooh.
[96:50.39]Sunk my battleship, motherfucker.
[96:52.53]You know what I mean?
[96:53.17]Let's give him some health.
[96:54.11]Yeah, I know what you mean.
[96:55.73]I played that.
[96:59.17]Give him another shot.
[97:00.11]Come on.
[97:00.33]Give him more health.
[97:07.01]Come on, man.
[97:07.43]Give him more health.
[97:09.35]Oh, what's that?
[97:09.99]Look to the left.
[97:10.78]Look to the left.
[97:12.46]In that little cave over there.
[97:13.52]Gave him some hell.
[97:23.59]Didn't think I could see him.
[97:24.91]He poked his head out right there.
[97:27.83]Alright, step away.
[97:28.65]Back up for a second.
[97:34.53]I don't want to get you.
[97:35.51]I'll hold the button down.
[97:36.85]I don't want to get you with this hell.
[97:38.85]Boss, I think there's a monster in this cave.
[97:40.89]There's a dead body outside and the lip of it, and it's looking a lot like Return of the King Shelob.
[97:46.00]Oh, no, it's me.
[97:47.80]We got one.
[97:51.14]Sir, do you want me to give him some help?
[97:54.26]Yeah, give him some help.
[98:02.11]Sir?
[98:15.21]Sir?
[98:18.55]Yep, that's alright.
[98:19.59]Still alive, just a bit concussed.
[98:22.97]Thank you.
[98:26.50]We okay?
[98:27.04]Oh, he's dead.
[98:27.68]I think we're okay.
[98:29.38]You did kill the other one.
[98:30.74]Oh.
[98:31.62]He's not okay.
[98:34.70]I can hear screaming from inside the base.
[98:36.74]From inside the cave?
[98:37.84]Let's move on ahead.
[98:39.19]Here, fall in the cave if you're brave enough.
[98:41.09]But, you know, if you're not, then that's alright.
[98:43.02]Just want to make sure I get this clear.
[98:45.06]Monster sounds inside the cave.
[98:46.30]Turn your head inside the monster cave.
[98:47.78]There's a monster.
[98:48.58]Is this you?
[98:49.04]Is this you in the exterior of the cave?
[98:50.56]It's me.
[98:51.74]Is this you?
[98:52.80]Give us a wave.
[98:55.67]Okay.
[98:55.99]Good.
[98:56.33]Alright.
[98:56.65]Good.
[98:56.91]Good enough.
[98:58.25]What do you see out there?
[99:01.55]I didn't see anything, but I could hear a struggle inside.
[99:06.65]Inside the cave.
[99:07.15]What's the plan?
[99:09.25]I was given help.
[99:10.15]Are we still alive?
[99:11.76]That's good.
[99:12.38]Oh, wow.
[99:13.69]You're in coma for a while longer than I was.
[99:15.31]You look like hell.
[99:15.87]Yeah, I came too.
[99:18.75]That's good.
[99:20.93]Alright, so game plan here.
[99:21.87]They're going to be... Are they holed up in this house over here?
[99:26.23]That's right.
[99:27.70]On a zip line in over here.
[99:29.12]I'm not sure about that.
[99:30.20]I'm not sure.
[99:32.08]That might be a little too dangerous for me.
[99:34.56]Well, you know what?
[99:35.60]Danger is my middle name, boss.
[99:36.74]Check this out.
[99:38.20]Show me your license.
[99:41.54]No.
[99:42.22]Show me your license.
[99:42.81]Prove that.
[99:44.08]I'm not going to show you.
[99:44.64]I'm not going to show you.
[99:45.36]I'm coming.
[99:45.62]I'm coming.
[99:45.86]I'm coming right now.
[99:46.42]I want to see your license.
[99:47.52]No, it's a figure of speech.
[99:48.76]You don't want to see my license.
[99:50.24]Take my word for it.
[99:51.50]Guys, they are looking at us.
[99:52.72]Alright.
[99:54.16]Well, you're going to have to watch this.
[99:56.06]I'm going to go right in.
[99:59.78]See me, motherfuckers?
[100:00.62]This is my email name.
[100:03.24]Oh, shit.
[100:05.14]No.
[100:05.96]Oh, God damn it.
[100:08.82]I was too busy fucking laughing.
[100:10.74]Oh, God damn it.
[100:14.19]Fucking the weasel starts laughing.
[100:16.23]The weasel from Who Framed Roger Rabbit and can't operate the machine to dunk Roger Rabbit into the fucking toon jutes.
[100:23.47]You might just get the gold star.
[100:24.98]God damn it.
[100:25.96]Hold right through the neck.
[100:29.58]Perfect.
[100:30.84]Fucking God damn it.
[100:31.64]That would have been perfect.
[100:43.71]Alright, we tried our best.
[100:46.25]Hey, everyone.
[100:46.87]New recruit here.
[100:48.55]Hello.
[100:49.91]Hey.
[100:51.56]Someone teach me how to shoot my gun.
[100:53.16]Oh!
[100:53.54]Oh, oh, yep.
[100:54.72]That's how you learn.
[100:55.94]That's how you learn.
[100:57.52]Yeah, try by doing.
[100:58.96]No, don't.
[100:59.58]You don't need a teacher.
[101:00.96]Calm down.
[101:01.34]Safety on.
[101:02.44]No.
[101:03.84]There you go.
[101:04.44]Getting it.
[101:07.04]Where do we take the briefcase?
[101:08.62]Do I have to bring the briefcase somewhere?
[101:10.60]I think back to this big purple... Oh, maybe to the side.
[101:15.78]This side of the base.
[101:17.02]Turn it there.
[101:19.22]I'm just going to bring it.
[101:21.70]Do they actually expect us to be ready to go?
[101:25.87]I'm walking it right into the drop zone.
[101:27.09]Do you think they even expect this at all?
[101:31.49]Why would they?
[101:37.36]Especially if I go, if I go, like I'm just, I'm there.
[101:39.16]I'm already there.
[101:40.94]If you're polite, that's like half the battle.
[101:42.42]Just, you know.
[101:44.40]It really is.
[101:45.66]I think we just have to do some common courtesy.
[101:47.93]It's not that hard.
[101:58.52]Where about you say that that circle was?
[101:59.64]Inside the building?
[102:02.59]Uh, fuck if I know, but I'm gonna say maybe right on the other edge.
[102:05.50]Oh, yeah, there it is.
[102:06.34]There's a cave on the other edge.
[102:08.56]I'm almost there.
[102:09.68]Yeah, we're already around.
[102:10.62]If you hold control, you can run.
[102:13.60]I'm about to be there.
[102:15.54]So, this is looking like a W. This is looking like a W, for real.
[102:18.56]They're too busy, like... Oh!
[102:21.00]Briefcase on the ground!
[102:24.08]Are you okay?
[102:25.07]I'm okay.
[102:25.51]I'm alright.
[102:26.81]Sir, did you try the common courtesy?
[102:31.55]Put your hands in the air!
[102:34.37]FUCK DAMMIT!
[102:37.04]Who the fuck walks around the outpost like that?
[102:44.42]Who does that?
[102:44.90]We were so close.
[102:45.92]We were just gonna walk right in.
[103:05.01]It's right there.
[103:06.19]He's gonna get it.
[103:07.19]It's right there.
[103:08.67]He's gonna do it.
[103:09.33]They're too busy fucking around.
[103:12.49]Oh, no, he doesn't see.
[103:13.17]I think he played for that one.
[103:19.66]I think he played for that.
[103:20.54]Is he gonna... Is he actually gonna do this?
[103:25.84]Oh, my God.
[103:26.38]He was behind the whole time.
[103:29.56]Wow.
[103:30.24]Don't worry, sir.

[104:02.95]Stop right- Are you done moving?
[104:04.41]I can keep jumping all day!
[104:06.05]Knock it off.
[104:07.15]Knock it off.
[104:08.49]I got the strongest leg.
[104:10.25]Oh no.
[104:14.34]Oh well.
[104:15.12]Oh no.
[104:16.18]Alright, which map?
[104:17.18]Trainjack?
[104:18.30]Trainjack, trainjack, trainjack.
[104:20.14]I got another like one or two.
[104:21.60]We can do a section registry.
[104:23.32]Those are the two like good ones.
[104:28.63]Alright, two more.
[104:31.33]Oh no.
[104:32.38]Okay, this is the perfect one to end on.
[104:35.96]Why didn't we start on this one?
[104:36.94]Holy shit.
[104:40.22]I'm still with the train.
[104:41.64]Why am I still with the train?
[104:55.12]Why would I be going this fast with the train?
[104:59.04]They need to turn around and come out here and look.
[105:00.56]Come out and look.
[105:04.08]I hope somebody comes out and looks.
[105:05.24]Oh, there he is.
[105:07.68]He jumped off the train too.
[105:09.21]Oh, no.
[105:13.01]I think we just stay.
[105:14.11]Yes, sir.
[105:16.49]Okay, I thought that was something worth talking about.
[105:18.69]Apparently not.
[105:19.17]Weird.
[105:23.02]This is some Mario Kart Super Nintendo shit though, man.
[105:26.54]Where is the train going?
[105:30.92]This train doesn't make any sense.
[105:33.51]Hold on.
[105:35.29]I think it's just on a constantly... Is it on a constant cycle?
[105:40.31]Because there's no way this train is moving on actual tracks.
[105:43.89]So what's going on here?
[105:51.65]So the, okay.
[105:53.15]I am trying to figure this out.
[105:58.49]It's a big level though.
[106:01.54]The track and the train are both moving at the same time.
[106:03.90]I get it.
[106:04.26]Okay.
[106:05.50]And it's just cycling through a mountain.
[106:07.14]I get it.
[106:08.62]Nice.
[106:11.08]Now we're about to see.
[106:12.64]Messages for me.
[106:13.87]Something play out here.
[106:15.25]Yeah.
[106:15.87]Okay.
[106:16.15]I'm going to go do that.
[106:19.17]Alright.
[106:19.45]Well, I'm going to go get the conductor now.
[106:23.93]That's right.
[106:25.05]Excuse me.
[106:25.45]Tickets, please.
[106:26.37]Tickets, please.
[106:27.13]If you guys could sit down.
[106:28.19]Oh, no walking around in the loitering train.
[106:31.27]Fire hazard.
[106:33.07]No, it's okay.
[106:33.57]It's okay.
[106:34.34]This is the... This is where it gets dangerous.
[106:36.18]This is the ticket, man.
[106:37.90]Yes, sir.
[106:38.68]This is a troubling terrorist town.
[106:39.84]Okay, hand out your ticket.
[106:50.11]Hand out your ticket.
[106:52.43]Yes, sir.
[106:55.07]What is that?
[106:57.27]He was playing an 80s synth.
[106:59.73]Whoa, what'd you do to him?
[107:02.61]What'd you do to him?
[107:03.87]What the fuck was that?
[107:05.53]If you could just follow me to the back of the train, please.
[107:07.67]He was my student.
[107:10.79]What the fuck was that?
[107:12.64]And that's where you're wrong.
[107:16.36]Those are our bodies.
[107:18.54]Yeah?
[107:19.48]He wasn't your student.
[107:22.40]Have you ever heard of Roswell?
[107:25.49]No.
[107:27.83]The alien accident.
[107:29.35]Here it comes again.
[107:29.83]Here it comes again.
[107:31.08]The government covered up.
[107:33.70]Oh, yeah.
[107:36.66]What's he doing down there?
[107:37.88]Where did the tracks go?
[107:42.34]It's too late for all of us now.
[107:44.12]We know too much.
[107:47.50]Hey, where'd the other guy go?

[108:34.17]Fine.
[108:38.87]Let's see what they're saying.
[108:45.74]Sounds real quiet down here.
[108:47.16]He's gonna unhinge it.
[108:50.14]He's gonna unhinge the train.
[109:00.61]We got a chase scene.
[109:01.41]Now let's go back over here.
[109:10.90]Okay, she was just stuck in an NPC loop.
[109:19.48]She was in an NPC loop.
[109:21.78]That's what she was doing.
[109:22.60]That was fucking hysterical.
[109:25.24]She was doing an NPC loop.
[109:27.02]Fucking genius.
[109:27.94]That's absolutely hysterical.
[109:29.20]Oh, you're in trouble.

[109:48.12]Is there anything you can tell me about your companion?
[109:50.80]Come on, give us some alien stuff.
[109:52.06]Give us some alien lore.
[109:53.60]He was trying to learn how the train works, and I told him when I knew.
[109:55.84]You already got one of the other team members.
[109:57.98]No.
[109:59.75]Is this it for me?
[110:03.29]Do I owe thanks to you?
[110:04.27]No.
[110:05.05]It's it to me.
[110:06.71]Goodbye.
[110:11.86]Terrorists win.
[110:14.46]He's still alive.
[110:15.66]No, no, he's not.
[110:19.70]Alright, let's get a look at two.
[110:21.66]Look at two.
[110:22.80]Good round.

[110:28.13]Thank you.
[110:29.71]Thank you.
[110:30.35]Thank you.
[110:30.81]I liked watching it the whole time because I got pushed off of the train.
[110:37.89]You're not going to jump off the back again, are you?
[110:40.87]No, I'm... No.
[110:42.39]No!
[110:43.15]No!
[110:43.51]Alright, well that's fine, because I found a secret back here.
[110:48.42]Did he actually... Is there actually a secret back there?
[110:50.82]Down into the pits.
[110:52.62]Oh, I really want to try, but I also don't... I don't want to fucking... No, it's fine.
[110:55.80]It's safe.
[110:56.86]It's safe.
[110:57.50]I'm down here.
[110:58.48]Oh, I'm going to do it.
[110:59.12]I'm going to risk it.
[110:59.82]Don't risk it.
[111:02.67]Don't.
[111:02.87]Welcome to the pit, brother.
[111:04.41]Alright, I'm going to risk it.
[111:05.37]Here we go.
[111:07.62]There's not enough room.
[111:08.20]Oh, that's so cool.
[111:08.90]I want to do it too.
[111:10.72]I don't want to be left out.
[111:12.10]How do I do that?
[111:12.60]Don't leave me out.
[111:13.20]Don't leave me out.
[111:14.40]Don't leave me out.
[111:15.10]Come on.
[111:15.30]Don't leave me out.
[111:15.88]Oh, I didn't get left out.
[111:16.66]Oh my God.
[111:17.01]Thank God.
[111:18.39]This is so much fun.
[111:42.99]So I didn't actually check if there is an exit to this place.
[111:45.87]No, no.
[111:47.41]Well, as long as we're together, right?
[111:50.67]This could be... Like sneaking under it, like in a tunnel.
[111:53.55]How are we doing this?
[111:55.83]I would be okay dying here.
[111:57.23]This is a secret.
[111:58.40]Look at that dirt down there.
[112:02.24]We're doing it.
[112:03.22]They have no idea where we are.
[112:04.52]This is so funny.
[112:06.24]This is so funny.
[112:06.92]Did anyone grab the briefcase?
[112:08.78]Can you imagine?
[112:09.64]No, we didn't grab the briefcase.
[112:10.60]That's okay.
[112:13.29]Briefcase?
[112:13.81]Who needs a briefcase?
[112:15.44]Yeah, I bet they're wondering what our voices, where we're coming from.
[112:19.66]And they don't even know we're down here.
[112:20.94]We're in the walls.
[112:22.24]We're in the walls.
[112:23.72]Yeah, have you ever seen Alien?
[112:25.06]Oh, they're in the walls.
[112:32.17]It's us.
[112:32.45]We're the people in the walls.
[112:33.87]We're the aliens.
[112:35.17]We're in the walls.
[112:38.03]Let's really mess with them.
[112:39.13]Let's really scare them.
[112:41.10]Oh, yeah.
[112:41.92]Oh, what happened over there?
[112:43.98]They're in here, too!
[112:45.66]They're in here, too!
[112:46.48]What do you mean, they're in here, too?
[112:48.56]They're in there!
[112:50.56]Wait, go back, back, back, back.
[112:51.80]Turn this way, this way, this way.
[112:54.09]Go, go, go.
[112:55.77]How is it possible that we have the same funny idea?
[112:58.55]Let's just wait for him.
[113:07.78]Everyone throw out your pizzas this way and we'll detonate.
[113:11.38]We'll blow the whole fucking train.
[113:14.76]Use your selfie sticks to look around the corner.
[113:17.32]We don't have any pizzas.
[113:20.22]Oh, wait, we don't have any.
[113:23.29]Sorry, we've got grenades.
[113:24.81]That'll work.
[113:25.17]Yeah, we have grenades and guns.
[113:29.21]Dude, just wait for this doggy door to open and just kaboom.
[113:32.87]You know what I mean?
[113:33.33]Yeah.
[113:36.09]Okay, I'm ready.
[113:38.15]Can't see, there's too many men in front of me.
[113:40.01]There's too many bodies.
[113:42.66]Sorry, we're ready.
[113:43.30]I can sort of see through the crack.
[113:45.66]I can tell you guys when they're coming.
[113:47.34]As long as they don't come from behind us, that would really be... Yeah, but that's what the selfie sticks are for.
[113:51.80]That's fair, yeah.
[113:57.08]Are they coming?
[114:06.06]Somebody playing Jeopardy?
[114:07.12]What's going on here?
[114:17.85]Come through the door!
[114:19.29]Maybe that'll work.
[114:23.77]Get in the door!
[114:24.91]Hope that works.
[114:30.05]We have tickets, but you'll have to come in the door to collect them.
[114:43.11]I can I can feel it's gonna happen here in five seconds Go the other way
[115:02.67]Don't stop which is it which way is the right way which way is the way that I see?
[115:06.43]We are almost there keep going just keep going Why why don't I keep bouncing
[115:31.74]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[115:32.78]Keep going, keep going, keep going.
[115:34.04]We're almost in front of the train.
[115:36.38]I can't get up there!
[115:41.55]I'm stuck!
[115:42.35]He's having difficulty.
[115:43.99]Alright, I'm good.
[115:44.63]No, man, I'm behind.
[115:45.47]Are you okay?
[115:47.23]What's wrong with you?
[115:48.21]I just, my leg got stuck in the little divot.
[115:52.66]My leg got stuck in somebody's ass.
[115:54.70]There was a person in the way.
[115:56.66]We take control of the train.
[115:57.86]We unhinge the rest.
[115:59.06]We win.
[116:01.06]I like it.
[116:10.95]This is a long train.
[116:12.03]Do we know how to get back up?
[116:18.43]This is a very long train.
[116:26.53]Almost there.
[116:26.89]Oh, you know what?
[116:28.57]We can just jump up.
[116:29.89]Yeah, there we go.
[116:31.05]Alright, now.
[116:34.50]Jump up?
[116:34.82]Come on up here.
[116:36.22]Yep.
[116:44.80]Got it.
[116:46.51]Nice.
[116:51.69]Take out your silenced PP7s, by the way.
[116:59.48]Don't you guys know how zombie games work?
[117:00.66]Close the doors behind us.
[117:06.16]Wait for me!
[117:07.14]I gotta get through there, too!
[117:09.92]You told us to do it.
[117:12.77]Once we're all get through.
[117:14.21]Why would you tell us to do it if you don't want... We'd have to wait for you every time.
[117:18.59]Yeah, but no person left behind.
[117:20.73]Didn't you say that earlier?
[117:21.63]God damn it.
[117:26.35]Excuse me.
[117:26.89]Excuse me.
[117:27.13]I'm going to need you to show me your tickets, please.
[117:29.24]Okay?
[117:29.60]I can see there's a lot of you and I don't want any trouble.
[117:33.88]I just need to know if you have your tickets.
[117:45.78]I had a ticket.
[117:47.00]I actually had one.
[117:48.30]I had a ticket.
[117:49.16]I had a ticket.
[117:54.07]I was going to get it out of my pocket.
[117:55.79]Oh, what the fuck?
[117:58.09]Because I had my head poked out.
[118:06.57]Shane shot me in the face.
[118:08.55]I don't want to talk about that.
[118:11.01]I wanted to pull a ticket out.
[118:12.65]I had one.
[118:14.41]I was going to use my key card.
[118:17.46]Where was he?
[118:18.00]Rooftop sniper.
[118:21.44]I want to get a sniper.
[118:24.58]Are they rare spawns?
[118:25.56]Yeah, you won't be able to get one on this map.
[118:37.59]This is so much faster.
[118:41.67]We just go on the roof.
[118:42.45]We went under before.
[118:44.35]Let's go over this time.
[118:45.23]Start launching bombs at them.
[118:46.15]Let me tell you if you're in the right spot.
[119:07.71]You gotta get that.
[119:08.43]You gotta hit that.
[119:08.91]That's a perfect hit.
[119:10.27]Wait, wait.
[119:10.65]Is that facing the right way?
[119:12.27]Don't.
[119:12.73]Are you okay?
[119:14.69]What's wrong with your voice?
[119:15.94]No.
[119:16.68]I'm gonna slip.
[119:19.02]Someone needs to go to the box.
[119:22.14]I got it.
[119:23.34]Oh, my God.
[119:24.72]No.
[119:25.14]Is he dead?
[119:26.64]He's dead.
[119:27.18]No.
[119:27.70]No.
[119:27.98]No.
[119:31.84]Oh!
[119:32.14]There is a sniper!
[119:33.00]There is a sniper!
[119:33.66]They're actually- Down, down, down, down!
[119:35.52]There's a sniper all- Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!
[119:38.80]I'm not fucking around there!
[119:40.16]We were making the joke!
[119:42.72]There's a sniper across the way!
[119:45.34]Okay, well get up and we can get you out of here!
[119:49.27]God damn it, he's fucking firing at us!
[119:52.61]Are you launching the bomb?
[119:54.07]Okay.
[119:54.99]I was off by about 25 feet.
[120:00.07]What are you guys doing up there?
[120:05.26]right by my fucking head.
[120:10.80]Listen, easy with that firing.
[120:15.32]That was perfect.
[120:18.08]I'm taking heavy hits, I'm taking heavy hits.
[120:26.40]You read me, you read me.
[120:27.80]Guy with the suit, did you make it?
[120:31.02]Guy with the suitcase.
[120:33.88]I saw you get hit mid-air.
[120:35.00]I don't think he knows he's the suitcase.
[120:37.82]Oh no.
[120:38.38]Please respond.
[120:40.14]The surround is never going to end now.
[120:42.28]For the love of God, don't leave me alone here.
[120:44.92]I can't tell you that that wasn't intentional.
[120:47.20]How the fuck did I get killed in one shot?
[120:49.78]Just jumping around like a fucking dickhead.
[120:55.11]Right in the face.
[120:57.41]That could not have hit me.
[120:59.25]That couldn't have hit me closer than the center of my nose.
[121:03.74]Alright, let's see what's going on over here.
[121:06.80]Oh, that's so far away.
[121:15.31]The briefcase is gone.
[121:15.99]Oh, the briefcase fell!
[121:18.39]Somebody... Somebody... No.
[121:20.38]Oh, he did it!
[121:23.00]Well, good luck getting the fucking briefcase.
[121:26.20]Dang, man.
[121:28.90]I thought I was gonna make it.
[121:32.21]It looked like it for a minute.
[121:33.49]Alright, let's find that sniper then, I guess.
[121:35.53]There is the sniper.
[121:38.02]Oh, there is the sniper?
[121:38.88]Oh, yeah.
[121:40.44]Where is that sniper rifle?
[121:42.54]It's probably in the front.
[121:44.56]Whoa, what are these gross cameras?
[121:47.20]Um, maybe on the roof?
[121:49.92]Whoa, we're defenders now.
[121:51.02]Okay.
[121:52.74]Whoa, this is what they see?
[121:55.44]This is what they've been seeing the whole time.
[121:58.14]We got pizzas now, boys.
[121:59.20]I repeat, we got pizzas.
[122:01.06]Oh, god damn it!
[122:02.68]Fuck!
[122:03.58]No!
[122:04.20]God damn it!
[122:05.04]I'm not even gonna say anything.
[122:06.64]I'm not even gonna say a goddamn word.
[122:08.88]Fuck!
[122:09.58]Oh, no!
[122:10.40]Shit!
[122:12.02]They don't even know.
[122:13.84]Oh, I'm so angry.
[122:15.93]Oh, that was an opportunity to get a sniper rifle.
[122:19.55]I'm going to get a fucking... I'm going to get a... Ah, no!
[122:25.59]I have a sniper rifle.
[122:27.35]I am the sniper.
[122:32.83]I found a mortar.
[122:33.76]I don't know how to use it.
[122:34.54]I'm just pressing it and shooting it.
[122:35.80]You're doing great, kid.
[122:37.22]To use the mortar, you hold the V button.
[122:42.38]If your mind was a keyboard.
[122:43.62]Oh, I'm so disappointed in myself.
[122:45.72]Then you click the mortar.
[122:46.74]Yeah, there you go.
[122:47.68]Fuck.
[122:49.74]Of course, if your mind was a keyboard.
[122:51.02]What, uh, what happened to that, that other guy?
[122:53.58]There they go.
[122:54.12]They're talking about me.
[122:55.88]They didn't even know that I fell off in the first ten seconds.
[122:57.62]You had an intern?
[122:58.72]Other guy?
[122:59.50]Intern?
[122:59.88]Yeah, there he is.
[123:00.94]They are on their way.
[123:01.88]I hear them.
[123:02.36]They are on their way.
[123:03.14]They are at the logs.
[123:03.76]Hey, I got visual on a guy.
[123:04.68]They are at the logs.
[123:06.16]I'm gonna... They are at the logs.
[123:07.82]I'm coming up.
[123:09.42]What the fuck happened there?
[123:11.68]I'm gonna put you down.
[123:12.86]Goddammit.
[123:14.20]So, so, did you make it?
[123:17.40]That was a second mate.
[123:19.98]This map is the best map, for sure.
[123:22.30]There's so many variables.
[123:23.50]I want that sniper rifle.
[123:36.19]Is that my body over there?
[123:38.27]Look at that.
[123:40.19]I'm inside of a casket.
[123:43.60]I may as well be inside a casket at a fucking funeral.
[123:48.73]Brickcase secured.
[123:55.85]Hello?
[123:58.14]Anybody?
[124:00.48]Oh boy, see ya.
[124:01.24]He's gone.
[124:01.64]He's... He just slithered.
[124:02.36]He snaked down.
[124:02.82]Got the briefcase.
[124:18.88]They're just playing... What's that game where you shoot mortars back and forth?
[124:23.16]You take turns?
[124:27.86]What is it called?
[124:28.38]I think it actually is just called like mortar or... That's not gonna happen, is it?
[124:32.38]Is that actually... Is it gonna land on him?
[124:38.32]He just almost shot this person over here.
[124:41.02]Worm... Tanks.
[124:41.96]No, not worms.
[124:43.46]Tanks.
[124:44.61]Tanks is more of an accurate description.
[124:53.17]He's got the sniper.
[124:56.84]Just hanging out over here.
[124:57.86]Let me take a mental note of this.
[125:06.86]They can just be on the ground too, huh?
[125:10.41]Yeah, they can just be sitting on the ground.
[125:15.07]Extreme sniping.
[125:20.10]Guns down.
[125:21.64]Same.
[125:23.16]Guns down.
[125:23.60]Alright, um, you got anyone else with you?
[125:28.88]What?
[125:29.28]No.
[125:29.77]Uh, no.
[125:30.17]What?
[125:31.29]Did he just, is he gonna hitman him?
[125:33.01]He's gonna do a hitman here.
[125:34.61]It's your conscience.
[125:36.21]Yeah.
[125:38.11]Piano wire this guy.
[125:39.15]You wanna drop your weapons and give up.
[125:41.85]Peacefully.
[125:45.47]That was some sly, sneaky shit.
[125:47.35]It really was.
[125:48.79]Go on.
[125:50.47]Don't be scared.
[125:51.83]How do I drop them?
[125:54.69]Hit I and drag them.
[125:57.89]I forgot we even have inventories.
[125:59.25]We have I. You don't even know that.
[126:02.34]Follow us.
[126:03.38]Keep going.
[126:03.98]Follow just him because it's just him.
[126:05.68]Go.
[126:06.46]Me.
[126:07.12]Follow him.
[126:07.64]Me.
[126:08.58]What the hell was that?
[126:10.84]How did he get stuck up in the ceiling like that?
[126:14.30]Who is this?
[126:15.62]That even confused me.
[126:16.90]And I know it was like a joke.
[126:18.40]Maybe the second half.
[126:19.32]We can talk to his second half.
[126:22.90]Listen.
[126:24.50]Surrender.
[126:28.08]Say something or I'll shoot.
[126:30.96]He's just hanging out back there.
[126:32.00]I'm taking him out.
[126:36.80]He's dead.
[126:40.98]Man, he's going to turn the corner, open up the end, and it's going to be a scary, scary moment.
[126:50.27]Just hiding in the airplane bathroom.
[127:02.76]What?
[127:05.98]What just happened?
[127:07.84]I have to stay now.
[127:09.73]This looks very interesting.
[127:17.35]Where are we here?
[127:17.97]This is new.
[127:21.09]This is welcome to the SuperMegaCorp home HQ.
[127:26.73]We have an alarm.
[127:29.34]Yeah, we got alarm systems.
[127:30.40]We have motion systems.
[127:33.54]Don't even begin to talk about the various cameras we have.
[127:37.46]Let's take a look.
[127:38.14]Nice.
[127:38.32]This is very good.
[127:39.94]Sleeping on the job.
[127:40.64]Come on, guys.
[127:41.14]Give me a break.
[127:42.78]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[127:43.32]Do you want to hold on?
[127:45.20]There's a document here.
[127:48.56]What does that say?
[127:51.34]um you want to read that yeah uh it says uh maintain watch of the security cameras and patrol to ensure the integrity of the level 3 server room reporting strange movements to all of the gamma members that's us right we are we are gamma that's right
[128:12.84]Okay.
[128:14.08]So, I'll watch.
[128:16.04]I'll watch the cameras.
[128:16.82]You can go and... I'll watch.
[128:18.95]I'll do my rounds.
[128:20.45]I'll let you know if I see anything.
[128:23.05]I'll be in touch over the radio.
[128:25.53]Use the comms, yeah.
[128:27.27]That's what they're for, you know?
[128:29.43]Alright, I'll see you around.
[128:34.61]See you later.
[128:37.17]And I guess you'll be seeing me before I see you.
[128:40.41]Yeah, you know, that's true.
[128:42.27]I'll be seeing you on the screen before you see me before I see you again, right?
[128:46.31]Alright, if you want to text me a pic, are you watching the screens?
[128:50.05]Hey, give me a peace sign when you get out there on camera, too.
[128:52.76]It'll be really funny.
[128:53.84]Alright.
[128:54.72]Alright, alright.
[128:58.78]Oh, man.
[129:01.60]Can't wait.
[129:02.48]Can't wait for that fucking peace sign.
[129:04.10]Go for it, man.
[129:05.24]What floor are you on?
[129:05.84]Let's see.
[129:06.18]You are on floor number... Floor number two.
[129:12.55]No.
[129:13.65]No, I'm still on floor number three.
[129:15.55]It's alright, though.
[129:16.71]Why?
[129:17.01]Oh.
[129:17.51]Oh, yeah.
[129:18.75]Give me that peace sign when you get out there.
[129:23.15]Does this thing even fucking work?
[129:26.09]These don't work.
[129:26.79]These don't actually do anything.
[129:28.29]I'm confused.
[129:29.71]Can you actually see anybody?
[129:34.99]Was that him?
[129:35.55]Oh, you can.
[129:37.23]Just saw you in that little building here, that little warehouse building with the boxes.
[129:41.01]That's right, that's right, that was me.
[129:42.03]Alright, I'm going to take the elevator now.
[129:43.37]Guess what form I'm going to.
[129:45.25]Ah, you're going to.

[129:55.42]Oh, he did it!
[129:56.20]Oh, my God, man.
[129:57.22]I did the face camera.
[129:58.26]Oh, my God.
[130:00.20]WE'RE GONNA GET SO MUCH TROUBLE!
[130:01.48]DON'T JUST, UH, JUST PREDUCE- HEHEHE!
[130:06.02]Okay, I'll pretend I'm not talking to anybody.
[130:08.03]Uh, yes, sir.
[130:09.05]Everything's as normal.
[130:09.93]Oh my god, hehehe!
[130:14.05]What are you doing?
[130:15.35]Alright, I'm going to the basement.
[130:16.53]Are there any other players?
[130:22.24]This time, I want you to say, in a really small voice, say, THE BOSS SUCKS!
[130:28.38]Cause you know he sucks.
[130:31.27]Oh my god, no, I'm gonna get fired.
[130:33.75]I'll delete the SD card.
[130:36.66]Okay, okay, okay.
[130:39.04]After the shift ends, I'll pull out the SD card, and I'll wipe it clean.
[130:42.38]Let me know when you're there.
[130:47.38]Am I there?
[130:47.82]Let me see, let me see if I can find you.
[130:50.73]What are you looking at here?
[130:52.35]I'm in the elevator.
[130:53.71]Oh, here we go.
[130:55.55]There's a big old, there's a white van here.
[130:58.23]Okay.
[130:59.25]There you are.
[131:00.47]I'm on basement.
[131:01.51]Oh, you see me?
[131:02.52]I just saw you for a second.
[131:03.58]Okay.
[131:03.76]Okay, okay.
[131:05.54]Hey, hey, Mr. Deville, I'm ready for my close-up.
[131:07.56]Here it comes.

[132:08.03]Yeah, B1.
[132:08.79]That's more important.

[132:48.74]I'll get rid of the tape and everything.
[132:50.76]You know?
[132:51.66]It's not... Whatever.
[132:56.60]Tony, I don't see any cameras down here in B2.
[133:02.08]Maybe if you... I don't see anybody at all.
[133:07.21]Tony, do we have a sewer grate that we leave open in B2 by any chance?
[133:13.21]You know... There's a real bad smell coming out of it.
[133:15.31]Yeah, I just saw somebody over in the room of the boxes with the white ground.
[133:22.51]On the third camera.
[133:23.91]You saw somebody, was it me?
[133:30.45]I think there was a... I did see you for a second.
[133:33.85]Yeah, I saw you.

[133:39.11]I'm going to turn back down.
[133:41.48]Hey, but, like, um... You know, I'm just, like, fucking around.
[133:45.36]Like, you know, about the whole, like, hanging out and everything.
[133:47.36]I just think if you wanted to, we could, you know?
[133:49.15]Just, like... No, um... No, let's, uh... Anyone want to get, like, a beer?
[133:55.37]Or what's, uh... Yeah, I mean, like, either... I mean, honestly, whatever you'd want to do, you know?
[134:06.45]I could drink.
[134:07.53]I mean, I don't like to drink that much, but...
[134:12.05]Oh, that's cool.
[134:12.59]I mean, I... What's up?
[134:15.57]I mean, I guess we can go... No, go ahead.
[134:19.12]We're in the middle of a call.
[134:21.00]If you want, I mean, I got a place right up back...
[134:25.77]Liberty Street.
[134:26.55]It's got a nice view.
[134:30.01]You like string lights?
[134:31.41]Fairy lights?
[134:32.69]Yeah, I like lights.
[134:34.43]I like lights and everything.
[134:35.31]It's got a nice ambience.
[134:39.15]If you're just curious, everything is like... The third camera looks like there's a little scratch on it or something.
[134:47.16]No big deal, though.
[134:47.62]Everything's fine.
[134:49.50]The third camera?
[134:50.42]Is that...
[134:51.95]You want me to check that out?
[134:55.30]Uh, no, honestly, like, if you, um, just, like, if you go down, you would go to the sewer anyways, right?
[135:01.40]I would, like, just check that and check the sewer and into the bathroom and make sure, like, it's, um, make sure everything's fine.
[135:09.68]You hear that, uh, Tony?
[135:11.98]No, you... You killed him!
[135:15.10]Oh, no.
[135:15.46]Oh, no.
[135:21.66]Is he dead?
[135:22.24]Tony, did you read me?
[135:24.10]Well, he's... He's not dead!
[135:25.28]Hello?
[135:25.74]What the fuck?
[135:26.66]Oh, fuck!

[135:37.11]Let's go get that drink!
[135:42.05]Oh, uh, hey.
[135:43.60]We're back here.
[135:46.88]Love prevails.
[135:51.06]Nice to see you guys.
[135:53.02]Hey, good to see you.
[135:54.14]Waking up at 6 a.m.
[135:58.80]I'll go take the front desk then.
[136:00.04]Yeah, I'm not feeling the desk for me.
[136:02.46]I'd like to go and look at stuff, you know?
[136:05.36]That's a desk job.
[136:07.87]Yeah, desk job.
[136:08.77]Desk jobs are for wankers, you know what I mean?
[136:12.23]Rebooting motion system, guys.
[136:14.38]I know, I know.
[136:15.16]You're working your way up.
[136:15.94]That's cool.
[136:16.62]That's cool and all.
[136:17.44]It's just us, you know, the higher ranking officials, we might as well go take a look.
[136:23.38]You guys ever think about how ugly this building actually is?
[136:25.70]We have really ugly buildings.
[136:26.48]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[136:26.82]She fell down the stairs.
[136:28.70]You got to use your legs, doll.
[136:29.86]You got to walk down.
[136:30.78]Wow, what a clump.
[136:32.06]What a clump.
[136:33.44]What a clump.
[136:34.18]That's right.
[136:34.92]You know that I've got a bad leg.
[136:37.44]You were there when I trapped my foot.
[136:40.56]Why is our boss a fucking psycho?
[136:42.61]I'm gonna take the stairs.
[136:43.85]I wanna see how much of a weird child our boss is that has to have Crayola colors for every single ground in this whole place.
[136:51.11]Music?
[136:51.27]Is he alright?
[137:11.00]You ever take an elevator so fast that your legs crumple when you hit the ground?
[137:17.60]Shane, you left your wallet in here, silly.
[137:20.31]I'm sorry.
[137:20.67]I'm sorry.
[137:21.01]Hold on.
[137:21.45]Hey, is there any cash in there?
[137:23.25]Wait.
[137:23.97]I'd like some.
[137:24.75]I don't see it.
[137:31.29]You guys want to play human chess?
[137:34.54]Oh, that's a great idea.
[137:35.36]Can I be the bishop?
[137:37.32]I get to be the king.
[137:39.87]I want to be the queen.
[137:41.35]I only go diagonal.
[137:44.43]I'm the king.
[137:45.01]I'll be right here.
[137:47.71]I'll be the queen.
[137:48.73]You're right here to the right?
[137:50.47]I move to square.
[137:52.71]We're reversing each other.
[137:55.49]You have to be the king too because there's no checkmate without two kings.
[137:59.69]I guess I'm a queen too then.
[138:02.66]Okay, I'm the bishop.
[138:03.70]I'll be the queen.
[138:05.00]Okay, I'm the king.
[138:06.17]You gotta checkmate me.
[138:07.71]King takes out bush up.
[138:09.75]No, you're not.
[138:10.31]What?
[138:10.59]Bush up?
[138:10.97]Who's the bush up?
[138:11.87]Bush up.
[138:13.65]No, I don't believe that.
[138:14.77]You're just in time.
[138:17.20]I think there's people in here.
[138:18.80]Hold up.
[138:19.08]I need to talk to them.
[138:19.66]Queen moves.
[138:23.30]I'd like to withdraw.
[138:25.22]Did we just win?
[138:25.88]No, you didn't win.
[138:31.01]I had to pick the lock to get in here.
[138:33.73]Excuse me.
[138:34.38]We're incredibly busy today.
[138:35.94]As you can see, our staff are occupied at the moment.
[138:41.12]They aren't giving me my money.
[138:43.20]We'll take our business elsewhere.
[138:44.64]This is beyond... What the fuck is happening here?
[138:48.87]Okay, so back here, I was one step away from being checkmate.
[138:54.11]You were the king.
[138:54.73]I was the bishop.
[138:56.43]I guess my king left.
[138:58.72]What the fuck is this?
[139:00.14]You're tripping me in the bank?
[139:03.30]What kind of service is this?
[139:04.80]Who else is out here?
[139:05.56]Are you here alone?
[139:07.52]Why do you want to take out this much money?
[139:10.26]What the fuck?
[139:10.75]Are you arrested?
[139:11.39]Guys, he wanted to take out like nine dollars.
[139:17.41]Like really?
[139:23.94]This bank account has like 62 bucks in it.
[139:27.10]Like, come on, he was just trying to take out money.
[139:28.86]I don't think I can... Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[139:32.62]This bank's very frugal, okay?
[139:33.99]We don't let anyone take out money, only deposit.
[139:36.03]Even if it's their own money?
[139:38.25]Yeah, no, no, it's a one-service bank.
[139:40.95]If they want to take out their money, they go somewhere else.
[139:44.01]So they deposit it here, and then it gets wired somewhere else.
[139:48.45]And then to take it out there.
[139:50.30]That's how it pays our checks, pal.
[139:51.88]That's why we're employed.
[139:53.54]Alright.
[139:54.12]That seems a little – I guess that's by the book in a way.
[139:58.00]Yeah, they're definitely by a book.
[140:00.98]Let's see.
[140:01.92]Read this book.
[140:02.42]Oh, here it is.
[140:04.08]This is the book.
[140:04.80]Excuse me.
[140:05.56]I'm looking for my son, and I want him to withdraw.
[140:08.86]Welcome to our bank.
[140:09.80]Oh, thank you.
[140:11.62]Sorry, we don't do withdrawals.
[140:13.90]Oh, you don't?
[140:14.46]Okay.
[140:14.94]No, deposit only, please.
[140:17.42]Sir, what does your son look like?
[140:19.97]It looks a lot like me, maybe a deeper voice, believe it or not.
[140:24.50]It's kind of a strange mix around here, but I don't know if he was here or maybe he got lost.
[140:35.00]You're our first customer, believe it or not.
[140:36.60]We haven't seen another person here yet.
[140:39.39]Oh, okay.
[140:40.61]Well, hey, I appreciate it.
[140:43.21]Sir, sir, sir, sir, your son was here.
[140:48.40]In fact, I'd like you to take, look at the ground.
[140:51.48]It's, oh, oh, oh.
[140:53.76]Are you sure that's my son?
[140:55.10]Maybe it's... Does your son have, does your son have $68 in his bank account and he's trying to get $9 out of here?
[141:00.51]Honey?
[141:03.49]Hey, our son's been shot in the face.
[141:05.77]I ain't doing this anymore.
[141:06.59]I ain't fighting for this shit anymore.
[141:08.67]Yeah, he's dead.
[141:09.49]We're gonna need to get another one.
[141:12.56]Are you defective?
[141:16.73]Are you a defective person?
[141:20.61]These people just want their money.
[141:21.61]I'm out of here.
[141:24.91]Sayonara.
[141:26.77]I ain't doing that shit anymore.
[141:40.11]Got my revenge.
[141:45.05]Corrupt bigwigs.
[141:48.02]Oh.
[141:49.50]Day two of the old grind, you know.
[141:50.86]Now I'm a different person.
[141:53.52]Yeah, the Tuesday.
[141:54.12]You know, classic Tuesday.
[141:55.92]Does anyone, can I find a shirt that says, I love Tuesdays?
[142:00.98]No, no, no, no.
[142:04.46]I just feel like, you know, it's the second day of the week.
[142:06.34]It's like, I already got the first day down.
[142:08.42]Oh.
[142:10.27]Enough.
[142:13.71]He's listening to this shit every day.
[142:15.55]He's trying to do my job.
[142:20.12]Work.
[142:20.96]Fucking assholes.
[142:29.08]The only reason why this place even stands is because I make sure nothing bad happens.
[142:34.57]Sit at your fucking desk.
[142:37.67]Do your fucking taxes.
[142:40.88]While I stand watchin', make sure shit done fuckin' is the fair.
[142:46.54]Another day, or another day, or another dollar, whatever.
[142:49.15]Welcome to the bank.
[143:05.45]How are you?
[143:07.50]Can I take your coat?
[143:10.10]Fucking hate this.
[143:14.77]Check everybody, make sure nobody has anything bad on them.
[143:17.37]Yeah, okay.
[143:18.27]Excuse me, hello?
[143:26.05]How are you?
[143:28.33]Oh, it's the old curmudgeon-y security guard.
[143:30.97]What is it now, Grandpa?
[143:33.93]That's... That's a...
[143:36.86]And all of you need to know that I'm here.
[143:39.80]Do your job, I'll do mine.
[143:42.62]Yeah, okay.
[143:43.22]Are the floors too shiny again?
[143:44.44]You want us to fucking call a janitor and tell him to use less soap?
[143:49.42]Take it up with Gail.
[143:50.84]Take it up with Gail.
[143:51.86]Not me.
[143:53.16]This guy, he's been here so long, he forgets what a real job is.
[143:56.40]Isn't that right?
[143:57.60]Hey, old man, think fast.
[143:58.80]Oh, yeah, dude.
[144:00.30]Oh, it's so funny, huh?
[144:05.79]Damn it, you fucking kid.
[144:14.63]Ever heard of a banana peel, old man?
[144:16.45]Yeah, I'll be taking it up with Gail and Rick later on.
[144:21.38]Oh, yeah?
[144:23.36]Do your job and get to work.
[144:26.04]Okay, alright.
[144:27.26]You're with me, scuzz boy.
[144:28.60]Come on.
[144:35.03]I gotta make sure everything works.
[144:39.73]Oh, don't worry about me.
[144:42.47]No, one of the doors is unlocked and I thought we had... Deborah, we just pranked the security guard.
[144:49.77]He's a complete freaking idiot.
[144:51.69]I can't believe him.
[144:54.87]You know I can hear you on the same radio channel.
[144:57.34]He doesn't even know how to use the radio.
[144:58.96]He just don't use the radio.
[145:04.76]Not even worth my breath.
[145:07.24]Not even worth my breath.
[145:08.72]Little shit.
[145:09.58]What are you, 17?
[145:10.06]I'll handle it.
[145:10.51]I'll handle it.
[145:11.33]Calm down, everybody.
[145:11.93]God damn it.
[145:12.51]I was 16 once, too.
[145:13.07]It sure is fun.
[145:13.73]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[145:14.55]Take it up with Gale, okay?
[145:39.63]Take it up with Gail, not me.
[145:41.67]Gail's the one that needs to be the proprietor and the arborator.
[145:45.27]I don't see anything down here.
[145:56.32]Old man, help us!
[145:58.16]We're trapped in an oven!
[145:59.00]What's happening?
[145:59.66]Gail, help us!
[146:00.30]You alright?
[146:04.11]What happened?
[146:04.55]What happened?
[146:06.31]What's going on?
[146:06.85]You got alright?
[146:07.43]You gotta help us.
[146:11.02]We're burning.
[146:12.78]We're burning.
[146:15.82]Get me out of here.
[146:16.94]It hurts.
[146:18.08]I can't.
[146:19.42]No!
[146:19.62]No!
[146:20.76]No!
[146:22.14]No!
[146:22.90]What are you kids doing in here?
[146:24.88]What is this prank?
[146:25.73]I don't know.
[146:30.52]I can push you out.
[146:31.28]Oh, shit.
[146:32.00]I can push you out.
[146:33.38]Force, force.
[146:35.40]What have you kids gotten me into?
[146:40.80]Cheryl, can you hear me?
[146:43.22]Okay, sorry, I have some customers right now.
[146:45.32]I'm stuck with these assholes.
[146:47.04]We're stuck in the oven on stage one.
[146:48.82]I don't care if you're stuck in the oven.
[146:50.34]No, no, we're going to die in here.
[146:51.78]That's your problem, sweetheart, okay?
[146:53.80]No, I'm alright.
[146:55.36]Great talking to you.
[146:59.05]I think these kids are supposed to have got a Christmas prank on me and Santa Claus like I look like Santa Claus or something.
[147:05.14]What are you talking about?
[147:06.32]You've been a piece of shit for the last 10 years.
[147:11.40]All of you.
[147:15.14]We're sorry.
[147:15.62]I won't be working here for three months.
[147:17.18]I'm throwing my way out of here.
[147:18.14]Will you stop putting up shitty paintings, you millennials?
[147:22.32]Oh, look at that.
[147:22.88]It's ours.
[147:30.17]That's what I said to
[147:50.44]They've been doing this shit for years.
[147:52.28]And I'm the one picking up the pieces.
[147:54.42]Always.
[147:55.28]Come with us.
[147:55.86]You understand?
[147:57.28]Put the grenade down.
[147:57.88]Put the grenade down.
[147:58.86]Look, I'm an old man, and I have really shaky hands.

[152:35.87]I thought... Wait, where am I?
[152:37.99]What bank is this?
[152:39.32]You are in the explosive bank of America.
[152:43.06]Ah, my favorite part of the day.
[152:47.56]Come right this way.
[152:48.24]We'll deal in something.
[152:49.22]You know, I deal in other currencies sometimes as well, you know, sometimes.
[152:51.90]Okay, do you do Bitcoin?
[152:54.10]Oh, you don't?
[152:55.04]Think about Bitcoin.
[152:56.33]It is at an all-time high.
[152:57.91]Go, go, go.
[152:58.51]Buy, buy, buy the Ethereum, too.
[152:59.99]Wait, okay.
[153:00.63]Wait, wait.
[153:01.35]No, I'm selling.
[153:02.45]You're going to sell Bitcoin.
[153:04.26]Yeah.
[153:04.94]Okay.
[153:05.32]Yeah, yeah, because I got to pay off my student debt.
[153:08.14]You know, I heard Bitcoin's in sort of a bubble situation.
[153:10.60]I don't know if you should really invest in it at the moment.
[153:13.93]Don't listen to that man.
[153:15.45]So, how much money do you have to invest?
[153:22.43]I have $1,000.
[153:23.43]$1,000 in Bitcoin.
[153:24.11]That's only going to get you about one-eighth of one Bitcoin.
[153:27.79]Can I interest you in bald coin?
[153:31.01]Bald coin?
[153:31.95]Yes.
[153:34.28]Appalled coin is for appalled men.
[153:37.53]It's one of my new currencies I've created.
[153:40.15]What about, like, thought coin?
[153:43.33]Do you have thought coin here?
[153:44.85]Excuse me, ma'am.
[153:46.55]Other people have something, you know, we need to get done today.
[153:48.82]Can you just move?
[153:49.46]Oh, my God, this guy.
[153:51.04]I'm sorry.
[153:52.48]Sir, excuse me, sir.
[153:55.12]I know that sometimes it takes a long time to deal with the bank, but you're going to have to be quiet for about five more minutes, maybe 50 at that time.
[154:01.13]Yeah, but five more minutes and Bitcoin's going to be at 9,000.
[154:04.05]I'd like to invest now.
[154:05.05]Come on.
[154:05.33]Well, isn't that funny, son?
[154:06.75]It already is.
[154:08.45]So what were you doing, ma'am?
[154:10.00]Let's get you to this.
[154:14.34]I need to scrape it to make sure the Bitcoin is real.
[154:16.08]We take it back.
[154:17.30]We need to make sure it's real Bitcoin.
[154:19.86]Yeah, that is pure Bitcoin.
[154:21.73]Excellent.
[154:22.65]And $1,000 it is.
[154:23.05]Oh, ignore the white powder coming off of that.
[154:25.75]That's not related.
[154:27.05]Of course it's not.
[154:27.65]Of course, of course.
[154:29.70]Okay, so I will exchange one Bitcoin for, uh, $1,000 USD.
[154:32.88]Is this USD?
[154:35.74]Uh, yes.
[154:36.60]Yes, USD.
[154:37.48]Thank you.
[154:37.88]Yes.
[154:38.20]Okay, so here you go.
[154:39.36]I mean, there's a few, like, Korean nickels in there, but ignore it.
[154:42.52]I'll exchange those.
[154:43.24]That's fine.
[154:43.62]So here you go.
[154:44.28]Here is your paper wallet.
[154:45.46]Thank you.
[154:48.50]Uh.
[154:49.80]Um, thank you so much for the Bitcoins.
[154:52.38]I'm gonna go, you know, invest these and, uh, you know.
[154:56.12]Wait, wait, wait.
[154:58.04]Oh.
[154:59.19]Somebody's got to stop doing that.
[155:02.09]I told her we dealt in explosive money.
[155:04.73]She didn't even listen to me.
[155:05.71]I thought, wait, you said we didn't or you did?
[155:09.06]I do, we do, and that's fine.
[155:10.38]We would have had a good laugh about that.
[155:12.22]Okay, okay, well, then I have some more.
[155:13.82]I have more, I have more, I have more.
[155:17.66]Oh, my God.
[155:18.28]Get over it already.
[155:19.32]Who else we have in mind?
[155:20.45]I'm going, I'm going.
[155:21.93]60 Litecoins, please.
[155:23.07]I like it volatile.
[155:24.51]Okay.
[155:24.75]Litecoins.
[155:25.63]Litecoin it is.
[155:27.56]Hmm.
[155:28.68]Well, why Litecoin, can I ask?
[155:32.43]Because I think it's going to be the most volatile in the future of all the coins.
[155:35.61]What about Bitcoin Cash?
[155:41.49]You know, I already have some.
[155:42.45]The fork happened.
[155:44.17]What about Bitcoin Gold?
[155:46.97]I don't care about Bitcoin Gold.
[155:53.02]What about you?
[155:54.70]Yes, sir.
[155:57.02]I'll have three death coins, please.
[155:58.48]Three death coins!
[155:59.56]Okay, now that's a man I like to deal with.
[156:02.63]So three death coins, that'll be... How many people are dead here?
[156:09.41]I count two, sir.
[156:11.79]I can't do a transaction of death coins unless there is three dead bodies present.
[156:20.54]Ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-da-ba-ba-da-ba.
[156:24.98]Three dead bodies.
[156:26.00]Was that good?
[156:30.43]Was that a good end?
[156:31.07]I think... Yeah, I think the bit went well.
[156:36.83]Alright, thanks.
[156:37.53]I'm a little slow, sorry.
[156:39.83]Yeah, no, that's alright.
[156:40.37]Let's just, uh... Yeah, we're gonna... We're just gonna close for the night.
[156:43.69]Yep, thank you.
[156:45.15]Aw, I missed.
[156:45.97]I think that went well.
[156:48.07]I didn't, right?
[156:53.62]Alright guys, I think I'm out for the night.
[157:01.12]Alright, oh shit, look at this.
[157:03.14]Wait, what the fuck is this?
[157:03.90]There's a whole plan here.
[157:05.64]Now I gotta stay for one more.
[157:07.81]Oh my god.
[157:09.11]Have we ever gone through the supermarket?
[157:11.41]No.
[157:12.59]We need to do the supermarket.
[157:13.59]We gotta go through the supermarket.
[157:17.74]Why are we in like a rubber room?
[157:19.62]What's going on here?
[157:20.40]This is the saw room.
[157:23.07]Jigsaw's going to tune in in a second.
[157:26.01]Make your choice.
[157:28.65]I don't know.
[157:28.99]Do you know how to get out of here?
[157:30.01]I don't know.
[157:30.99]Oh, here we go.
[157:32.79]Oh, this is a dark alley.
[157:35.03]Alright, here we go.
[157:36.51]Let me go first.
[157:37.17]You got it.
[157:39.75]So where's the market?
[157:42.06]It's on the left.
[157:43.86]Yeah, you see that big red awning?
[157:45.62]I do.
[157:45.92]Alright, cool, cool, cool.
[157:51.26]Hey, how much are those bananas?
[157:52.78]30 cents at the grocery store.
[157:57.64]30 cents, that's it?
[157:58.36]Alright, cool.
[158:01.54]I forgot to ask this question.
[158:03.06]Any more of those?
[158:03.66]You're going to have to go see for yourself.
[158:07.25]God damn it.
[158:08.11]Thanks for the help, asshole.
[158:10.51]Fucking dickhead.
[158:12.67]I know, right?
[158:13.57]Just help a brother out.
[158:14.43]Over here, over here, over here.
[158:15.33]Right here.
[158:19.23]Can't even say there's any other bananas in there.
[158:21.03]Give me a break, man.
[158:21.75]Help somebody.
[158:22.31]I would have answered that question easily if somebody asked me.
[158:25.75]Here's bananas.
[158:26.89]They seem to be 2D and stretched along.
[158:30.76]Yeah, I don't think I want any bitmap bananas.
[158:34.20]Something else.
[158:34.72]At least a GIF or at least a JPEG.
[158:36.26]Like, come on, man.
[158:37.18]That's cheap shit.
[158:38.18]You don't want that.
[158:39.16]Oh, here's one.
[158:39.64]Where'd you get that?
[158:41.16]Same asshole.
[158:43.70]Why don't you get a second one?
[158:45.68]Excuse me?
[158:48.00]Where'd you get it?
[158:52.25]Back here.
[158:52.61]Hold on.
[158:55.37]Now, I just don't think I want any circa 2001 images.
[159:00.05]You know what I mean?
[159:00.99]I don't think I want these.
[159:06.23]Yeah, I'm not into that.
[159:07.35]I'm going to ask you one more time.
[159:10.93]Where did you get the banana?
[159:13.95]Right here.
[159:16.89]In the juice section?
[159:18.37]Yeah, okay.
[159:19.65]Can you just leave me alone?
[159:21.53]Yeah, the banana juice section.
[159:23.78]Banana juice.
[159:24.74]Oh, yeah, banana juice.
[159:25.84]The classic.
[159:27.20]You're pulling our leg.
[159:28.32]That actually sounds kind of good.
[159:30.40]Can you juice a banana?
[159:31.28]Does it work?
[159:31.70]Uh, yeah.
[159:35.56]If you take a banana and you squish it in your hands and wring it out into a cup.
[159:38.70]Can you just leave me alone?
[159:41.19]Oh, scoff.
[159:41.95]You know, scoff.
[159:42.91]Fine.
[159:43.09]Fine.
[159:48.09]Fuck!
[159:51.83]Get the fuck out of the way.
[159:55.67]Stupid fucking assholes.
[159:58.07]Everybody's such a fucking dick.
[159:59.83]Just wanted to go to the bank and take out, like, take out a fucking couple of iPad loans.
[160:05.07]Scoff!
[160:08.24]Ugh!
[160:12.84]Nobody at work.
[160:13.68]Okay.
[160:26.16]Here he is again.
[160:26.70]Can I just at least have a taste?
[160:40.16]What is that?
[160:40.64]What are you doing?
[160:41.48]You're a weird person.
[160:42.64]He's a weird person, okay?
[160:43.80]Oh, that's fine.
[160:44.68]He's a weird person.
[160:45.46]Why are you screaming at us with a banana?
[160:48.48]I don't understand.
[160:48.92]He's a weird person.
[160:49.78]Okay, fine.
[160:50.64]Weirdo.
[160:50.96]Sir, you forgot your change.
[160:58.83]Is he dead?
[160:59.53]I'm getting that banana.
[161:05.01]He's a weird person.
[161:05.97]I'm just telling you.
[161:06.65]He's a weird man.
[161:07.75]Whatever.
[161:11.46]Maybe when you finish your shift, we can ditch this place.
[161:15.68]I feel like this is a long shift, right?
[161:17.88]Are you a customer, sir?
[161:19.26]No, I'm not.
[161:19.74]I just stand here for fun.
[161:20.91]You're just looking.
[161:21.57]I get it.
[161:23.23]He's loitering.
[161:26.83]You should tell your manager.
[161:27.89]Normally, they kick people out of the store for loitering.
[161:30.41]I don't really know who my manager is.
[161:32.20]I can't even believe it.
[161:33.54]You're sitting in a cloud.
[161:34.68]Oh, fuck.
[161:36.46]A hole.
[161:39.55]See that but what just happened there?
[161:42.43]Oh wait a minute.

[161:56.18]It's her.
[161:56.58]Hold on.
[161:57.00]I've seen this one.
[161:57.54]Oh

[162:04.60]Yeah, we beat it, we beat it.
[162:05.57]Okay, good.
[162:05.95]Here we go.
[162:06.31]Mist is done.

[162:07.35]Nice, excellent work.
[162:09.19]Stephen King.
[162:10.69]Excuse me, it's not done.
[162:12.67]What?
[162:13.67]Oh, fuck, there's a second round.
[162:15.17]Oh, wait a minute, that monster got him too.
[162:16.75]Alright, which one of us is Stephen King?
[162:17.87]No, no, no, which one of us is- Who's the father that has to run into the mist to get the sun?
[162:21.84]It's me.
[162:22.86]I'm the father in this situation.
[162:24.56]You're the useless fucking weird person.
[162:26.88]Alright, Stephen King's the mist.
[162:30.33]Okay, come on.
[162:30.71]Son!
[162:32.01]Son, is this how the movie ends?
[162:33.79]Son!
[162:35.21]Is your father here to come get you?
[162:37.35]And then a big tentacled arm comes out.
[162:38.98]Spoilers for the movie!
[162:41.00]Son!
[162:43.44]Are you out here?
[162:46.00]Son!
[162:47.70]No, that's the happening.
[162:48.64]No, wait.
[162:49.24]What movie is this?
[162:58.33]Is this Big with Tom Hanks?
[163:12.84]Still got the banana.
[163:20.42]I just don't know what's happening.
[163:22.19]All I know is that time to write my own fucking movie.
[163:34.12]What are you doing up there?
[163:37.96]Are you shooting people?
[163:44.62]I was not shooting people.
[163:48.36]Why?
[163:53.00]I'm coming up there.
[163:56.28]I'm coming up there.
[163:56.96]We're going to talk about this.
[163:58.12]We're going to find out why you're doing this.
[164:04.77]You're going to find out why you didn't see the movie The Mist from Stephen King.
[164:09.63]See that movie?
[164:10.55]I thought it was overrated.
[164:11.79]Yeah, well, it was.
[164:13.25]How'd you die of- Hi there.
[164:20.46]I didn't do this one.
[164:21.68]For the record, I killed those guys for sure, yeah.
[164:24.12]But I didn't- this one came up here on Zone.
[164:26.00]It's probably something to do with that mist thing you said.
[164:28.40]Right, yeah.
[164:29.30]The movie The Mist from Stephen King.
[164:31.98]Okay, but you know that wasn't mist, that was smoke.
[164:38.27]That doesn't matter.
[164:39.47]Inside of there, our own reality.
[164:41.87]There is no continuity.
[164:43.97]This is like the Matrix anyways.
[164:45.27]We're living on two different realities right now.
[164:48.37]Watch this.
[164:49.54]You think I'm fucking kidding?
[164:51.46]If you come over here, if you cross over this line, then someone's gonna pull my plug out of my head.
[164:55.54]I don't even get to learn karate.
[164:57.90]Whatever that thing where you punch people and kick people and stuff.
[165:01.38]I'm not even going to learn.
[165:02.08]See, I told you.
[165:03.36]Oh, it didn't.
[165:04.62]So now you don't know karate.
[165:07.18]Oh shit, I don't know karate anymore.
[165:09.80]So that means all his bones fell out of his body.
[165:13.35]I still don't know fucking karate.
[165:21.17]You don't think I know karate?
[165:22.69]Of course I do.
[165:23.45]I've seen SpongeBob.
[165:26.79]Oh shit, another Stephen King movie.
[165:37.09]This is my last one.
[165:37.81]Watch this.
[165:40.79]Let's see how long it takes for someone to kill me.
[165:42.39]I just wanted to... Yes, I did this.
[165:52.96]I'm going to go into this Switch.
[165:55.34]Nintendo Switch.
[165:59.00]Super Mario 2.
[166:00.58]Super Mario 3.
[166:02.54]Super Mario Odyssey.
[166:04.42]This is my favorite Mario game.
[166:12.57]Open the door.
[166:15.73]Open the door now.
[166:19.44]Open the door now.
[166:28.54]There's not much time.
[166:30.16]How's my fellow intruder looking?
[166:32.48]Don't worry, I'm opening it, sir.
[166:35.12]Best name is Super Mario Odyssey.
[166:39.37]The Legend of Zelda Press of the Wild is the best game ever played.
[166:42.11]Do you have a Switch?
[166:43.47]Hey.
[166:43.65]I need a Switch.
[166:44.49]Mario Odyssey.
[166:46.45]The Wii U was not a failure, it was just that Nintendo accidentally messed it up.
[167:08.92]They didn't have one.
[167:09.90]I wasn't ready.
[167:11.08]I wasn't ready.
[167:11.70]Do you have a Switch?
[167:12.82]I wasn't ready.
[167:13.52]Do you have a Nintendo Switch?
[167:20.39]No.
[167:20.59]You get one.
[167:22.13]I'm going to make Donkey Kong for the Switch.
[167:25.91]You're going to make Donkey Kong for the Switch.
[167:27.67]What a stupid thing to say.
[167:28.87]Donkey Kong will be made for the Switch.
[167:34.97]Not stupid.
[167:50.96]Bed got forced into the room.
[167:53.80]Bed has been like glitching all over the place this whole fucking time.
[167:58.54]Oh no, it's just a shpee joke.
[168:00.64]Oh no.
[168:01.30]Have I reverted to like a shpee joke?
[168:06.97]I'm gonna rotate the map I think now.
[168:12.07]Okay.
[168:12.99]I mean, key... Yeah, there we go.
[168:15.09]Alright, let's do, uh... Let's do switch.
[168:16.75]Dome test.
[168:18.54]Dome test.
[168:19.76]No, I wasn't trying to do this.
[168:21.54]That's what I've reverted to.
[168:24.64]Alright.
[168:26.68]Dome test.
[168:28.82]Alright, this is the last one, no matter what.
[168:31.89]This is the last one.
[168:34.29]That's like Mr. Sneak Man.
[168:36.41]Oh, boy.
[168:37.23]This looks fucking elaborate.
[168:40.98]Is this that fucking shpee guy?
[168:42.68]That guy sucks.
[168:46.46]What the hell is that?
[168:50.16]Well, looks like we're in a kitchen.
[168:51.78]Alright, everybody.
[168:54.26]Cutthroat chef.
[168:55.48]Let's see the best dish you can perform in 30 seconds.
[168:58.86]Go.
[168:59.68]Okay.
[169:02.40]Where's the fresh produce?
[169:04.44]Yeah, where's the salt?
[169:06.53]You have nothing to work with.
[169:07.47]That's part of the challenge.
[169:09.31]But where's the panini press?
[169:12.81]I made pancakes.
[169:15.91]Okay, pancakes.
[169:18.68]I made a really, really long asparagus.
[169:22.34]Okay, that's good enough.
[169:23.32]Alright, you pass.
[169:24.24]You both made it.
[169:25.80]Who's the third contestant that didn't actually make anything?
[169:29.42]I don't know, but they got chopped.
[169:31.00]You know what I mean?
[169:32.20]Chopped.
[169:34.10]Chop him.
[169:35.24]Lift up the thing and say, you've been chopped.
[169:38.14]You've been chopped.
[169:39.37]Thank you.
[169:39.87]That was my face.
[169:43.19]I'm going to fucking win this, by the way.
[169:47.89]If you're not a good chef, you'll be chopped.
[169:51.41]Oh, yeah, the pastry chef that, like, pretends to not like, oh, I don't know pastries, but you, like, win the last round guaranteed.
[169:56.19]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[169:57.73]And I have, like, eight tattoos with, like, forks and knives on my arms.
[170:01.72]Yeah.
[170:02.26]That's me.
[170:02.78]And a ponytail?
[170:04.56]Yep.
[170:04.84]You wear sunglasses inside?
[170:06.95]Absolutely.
[170:07.51]Cool.
[170:07.81]Yeah, you're cool.
[170:08.51]Yeah, you're cool.
[170:09.17]You're cool.
[170:10.01]Remember that.
[170:10.41]I'm awesome.
[170:11.79]What are the ingredients?
[170:13.57]Come on.
[170:16.27]Three pizza pies and one asparagus.
[170:20.06]Make it into one dish.
[170:22.18]Go.
[170:23.07]Chop that up there Okay, why don't you start with him first the loser in quotes I made a creme brulee with
[170:50.13]I made a creme brulee.
[170:51.47]Creme brulee.
[170:53.33]Nice.
[170:53.59]Yeah.
[170:54.08]Well.
[170:55.72]What is this flying pizza you have?
[170:58.02]Over here.
[170:58.34]He throws his napkins over the corner, but there are- He obviously has killed them all, so he leaves victorious.
[171:06.47]So, uh, I had my dish, uh, Mr. Allen.
[171:10.87]This is a brownie.
[171:13.53]This is a brownie with a white chocolate glaze and a creamy Boston cream pie center, as you can see there on the top.
[171:21.19]And I made sure I toasted the edges.
[171:25.89]Did you get that, Pac-Man?
[171:32.50]This is probably when we go sit down and they judge and they talk about what we did.
[171:41.65]Where's the judge?
[171:44.09]Where's Tim Allen?
[171:45.67]Surprise.
[171:50.95]Tim Allen?
[171:52.13]Tim?
[171:52.53]Tim Allen's right here.
[171:54.85]Where's that ha-ha guy?
[171:57.17]You thought I was gone, but really, it was all part of the...
[172:01.41]the dramatic escalation of the show.
[172:03.37]Did you see what I had?
[172:04.12]Wow.
[172:05.80]Yes, your dish, sir, blew me away, quite literally.
[172:10.07]Yeah.
[172:11.59]Your dish didn't make the cake.
[172:14.50]That's what happens when you lose.
[172:15.92]I fucking told you that.
[172:16.92]Don't ever fucking doubt me again.
[172:18.68]Pastry chef my ass.
[172:19.82]I was in fucking culinary school for fucking 10 years.
[172:22.95]10 goddamn years I was in that fucking school.
[172:24.91]Didn't make very many friends.
[172:26.81]No's in the fucking book.
[172:28.65]And this is where I got to.
[172:29.53]$10,000.
[172:30.53]Actually, we had a budget cut, so it's only $1,000.
[172:36.19]But, you know, principles-wise, you're still the winner.
[172:42.31]Yeah, I'll take it.
[172:43.21]I'll take that.
[172:43.73]I'll take $1,000.
[172:44.03]That's fine.
[172:45.13]Alright, cool.
[172:46.09]There you have it.
[172:46.67]It's good.
[172:47.37]And we'll, as the tastiest dish, we serve it upon the lunch table.
[172:52.73]Okay.
[172:55.35]You gonna sit across from me or what?
[172:56.48]$1,000.
[172:56.50]Yeah, watch you eat the whole thing.
[173:00.20]You have to eat the $1,000 too.
[173:01.24]It's part of the show.
[173:03.24]Yeah, of course.
[173:04.44]Money is edible, of course.
[173:07.52]Mmm.
[173:07.66]Mmm.
[173:09.74]I dare say that's the best $1,000 edible bill I've ever had.
[173:16.62]Good.
[173:17.16]Is this the part where I strangle you?
[173:18.30]Is this the part where I strangle you?
[173:19.36]Is this the part where I strangle you?
[173:22.44]Yes, if you want to take over as my part in the role as Chef Boyardee, you have to strangle me now.
[173:27.76]Do it now.
[173:28.50]Strangle me.
[173:28.88]Throw me on the floor and do it.
[173:30.14]I want to do it.
[173:30.76]Don't have any remorse.
[173:31.90]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[173:33.06]What about the director?
[173:33.74]What about the director?
[173:34.48]What about the director?
[173:41.56]Fucking director thinks he's getting away.
[173:42.71]You didn't know that I had like a gun.
[173:43.91]I'm under arrest.
[173:47.91]I'm under arrest.
[173:48.73]Alright, that's it.
[173:50.35]I'm out of here.
[174:09.65]Alright, I'm out.
[174:11.21]Hey, how do you kill me?
[174:12.93]We can just kind of shoot you in the head if you want.
[174:16.59]Is that good enough?
[174:18.21]Just throw me over the edge.
[174:22.43]Ready?
[174:22.93]Do I get to say a speech?
[174:23.89]I get to give the last speech.
[174:28.31]His last words were, I've got a speech.
[174:38.79]My like stream is dying I'm gonna climb in my safety closet because I'm sad and I've had a bad day I got chopped My internet is dying right now, I'm losing frames
[175:06.12]Not for you.
[175:06.96]Stream's getting chopped.
[175:08.20]Why do you always reject me, Tomato?
[175:13.00]Tomato, why?
[175:13.94]There we go.
[175:14.98]What improv is this?
[175:15.66]I bet I can't hear you if you're talking.
[175:17.44]Yeah, I think I might have to call it, guys.
[175:19.06]My stream is like... I'm dropping a lot of frames here.
[175:28.49]Get out of this.
[175:30.93]Get out of there.
[175:32.88]Yeah, I'm going down back and forth.
[175:35.95]My frames are all over the place.
[175:40.87]That was a lot of fun, though.
[175:42.09]I had a really good time.
[175:48.10]Comcast.
[175:49.74]Yeah.
[175:50.56]Goodbye, everybody.
[175:51.98]There's a lot of bits that I have not been paying attention to, so I want to catch up with the bits before I go to bed.
[175:59.20]I will see you guys...
[176:02.19]on what's today's today is technically Sunday so uh interesting news for those of you that care about news on this coming week our good buddy Etalyx is going to be here in my house he's coming over for like a week
[176:25.84]So we're a bunch of like co-op games that we can't play over the internet.
[176:30.26]We're probably going to play them here.
[176:32.28]We're probably going to end up doing a handful of games that we never got a chance to play.
[176:40.31]So Etalyx will be over here.
[176:42.21]We'll play some co-op stuff.
[176:43.23]We'll have some fun.
[176:46.08]And that will... That's not going to happen.
[176:49.23]There'll be one more stream here.
[176:51.37]Or maybe two more.
[176:52.55]When does he actually come in?
[176:53.47]I'm not sure.
[176:55.07]Figure that out.
[176:55.56]But Tuesday.
[176:56.20]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[176:58.84]For... Actually, I'm not sure what we're going to play.
[177:01.08]We'll figure it out.
[177:03.85]Hopefully the stream doesn't die before I go through the bits, because that would be unfortunate.
[177:08.99]But if the stream does die, because it is dying, have a wonderful rest of your weekend here, guys.
[177:15.18]And I will see you in a couple days.
[177:18.16]But if you're going to stick around, and it would be cool if the stream didn't die, let's give it a go.
[177:26.42]So, I stopped back here.

[177:57.83]So I'll go watch.

[179:12.81]Cheeseburgers.

[179:28.82]SwiftRage.
[179:29.56]While we're on topic of school food, my college was the worst.
[179:34.18]I was served pancakes for dinner one night, and I cut through my pancakes, and the inside was just raw batter.
[179:39.18]Ugh.
[179:41.84]How do you fuck up pancakes?
[179:43.78]You literally pour the batter into the ground.
[179:46.68]The edge of the skillet is the ground.
[179:47.82]You just pour it onto the skillet.
[179:49.96]And then... You flip it over and just wait, like, fucking 30 seconds.
[179:55.54]Like, a minute.
[179:56.32]It's like, how do you fuck up pancakes?
[179:59.28]Well, that's terrible, man.
[180:01.74]Oh, whoops.
[180:02.66]I just, like, re... Oh, and I can do that?
[180:07.45]I can actually make it look like somebody gave me more money?
[180:09.93]I can, like, pretend to give myself money?
[180:13.41]That's weird.
[180:16.49]What?
[180:16.61]No, I'm not.
[180:17.01]Am I?
[180:17.17]I hope I'm not.
[180:17.67]I will fail that.
[180:18.15]You will get a failing grade.
[180:19.17]I'm so far removed.
[180:20.05]I'm so removed from school and essays and...
[180:40.96]calculations and math and shit that if I actually, if somebody, if you put me next to like an 11th grader or something or like a 10th grader and we both were going to write the same essay, mine would be a disaster.
[180:51.96]I'd get a D minus while they would get an A. Just so removed from it.
[180:59.33]Frexter, thanks for the $1.
[181:01.03]Not going to give bits tonight due to the EU unfriendly straw.
[181:04.41]Shit.
[181:04.65]Okay.
[181:05.77]My failure.
[181:07.66]Thank you.
[181:10.25]Stix, thanks for the $1.
[181:11.43]What was worse when they removed coffee milk from school lunches?
[181:15.49]Coffee milk is awesome.
[181:17.13]If I have a chance to drink it, I still do.
[181:20.35]It's very, very good.
[181:23.79]Me too.
[181:25.03]You don't realize how far removed you are when you're out of college and high school for a few years.
[181:30.33]It's weird.
[181:32.36]A little bit further up.
[181:38.30]Thank you to Dude McMahon for the $1.
[181:42.94]Jerma, the chats are going to take your ivory tower and seize the memes.
[181:51.08]Oh yeah, I forgot about it.
[181:51.82]We were talking about the Brum and shit.
[181:52.90]I forgot.
[181:57.47]Zahner, thanks for the $4.
[181:59.13]Show DMs.
[182:00.87]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[182:02.41]I'm never going to show my DMs.
[182:03.93]Maybe I'll make a fake account.
[182:07.72]SirFeline, thanks for the $1.
[182:10.98]ItPyrotech, thanks for the $10.
[182:12.32]They say, hello across the Pacific.
[182:15.61]Well, hello.
[182:17.05]Hello across the Pacific to you, Pyrotech.
[182:19.77]Hopefully you're evening or no.
[182:20.97]If you're across the Pacific, what time is it for you now?
[182:25.69]I don't know.
[182:26.81]Oh, boy!
[182:28.70]What?
[182:28.80]Oh, God.
[182:30.40]Oh, God.
[182:30.76]Oh, God.
[182:33.88]Alright, well there is $100 right now.
[182:36.18]We'll see what that is.
[182:37.64]We'll see what that is.
[182:41.50]Zahner.
[182:43.62]Zahner, thank you for the $100.
[182:45.18]Like I said before, you have been giving a lot of money lately.
[182:53.73]Thank you so much, dude.
[182:55.71]And you say, that by far was the greatest stream I've ever seen.
[182:58.75]I wish that I could do more than just give you money, but it's the least that I and everyone else can do.
[183:03.70]You're a great streamer, content creator, and person.
[183:06.74]I was planning on doing this at the end of this week, but you 100% deserve it now.
[183:10.66]I will always look forward to this stream and the chat.
[183:15.38]Well, my hands are together in a praying motion.
[183:21.23]That is so... That is so kind and... And the stream is dead.
[183:26.53]The stream is... Can you guys even hear me?
[183:30.35]We are going way down right now.
[183:33.35]I'm at like 500k a second.
[183:35.49]Hopefully the stream's still up.
[183:39.95]Oh.
[183:44.25]Boy.
[183:45.67]Hopefully it only needs like 500k to hear me talk.
[183:50.68]Hopefully it doesn't need to get more than 1,000.
[183:53.12]No, it's okay.
[183:54.00]Audio only is fine.
[183:55.04]That's alright.
[183:55.54]I'm not going to risk it here and put something on the screen.
[183:59.78]But thank you, man.
[184:01.99]Hands are together in a prayer, like I said.
[184:05.47]All I can say is thank you.
[184:07.91]That there are people like yourself and like everybody else that's hanging out here, everybody else that's paying money, everyone else that's just watching.
[184:15.21]My thanks is really... It blows my mind.
[184:20.60]that I'm able to do this and that there are people that are watching so I hope you're enjoying yourselves I really do because the more that I enjoy myself the more you enjoy yourselves and I think it's kind of it just goes back and forth thank you all of you with that there was another one that came right in fourth consecutive lion thanks for the 10 bucks
[184:44.09]They say, love you, Jerma.
[184:45.33]This was easily one of the best streams I've caught.
[184:46.97]You're always an awesome, positive, and hilarious person.
[184:49.61]You're a big positive part of my life.
[184:50.93]Thanks for everything.
[184:54.16]Thank you.
[184:56.42]Very, very much so.
[184:59.56]Alive fuck comcast Jupiter.
[185:06.36]Thank you, fourth consecutive line.
[185:10.14]Much love.
[185:12.22]Do I want a drink?
[185:14.85]Oh, that's from earlier.
[185:15.67]Oh, yeah.
[185:17.21]Hi, Drove.
[185:17.77]Thanks for the 25 cents.
[185:20.20]Thank you so much.
[185:22.08]Bluezy.
[185:22.78]Bluezy2, thanks for the $1.
[185:25.08]You might have missed my $10 tier, but I just wanted to say that this stream was a complete blast.
[185:29.24]I can go and say to my friends that I started a riot on Jerma's stream, watched him roleplay with some people I don't even know, and laughed my ass off by watching the most hilarious person I've ever known.
[185:40.30]This was the second stream of yours I've watched, and I loved it.
[185:44.73]It's like, I hear this... But here's what I never want to have happen, right?
[185:53.77]The last few messages that you've heard me read are very, very extremely nice talking about how much fun they're having here.
[186:04.60]You guys talk about how you love being here and shit like that.
[186:09.78]It's like...
[186:12.17]Hearing that, I don't want to ever have it go in one ear and out the other.
[186:17.31]This stream, the YouTube channel, just the whole thing in general, I have to try to keep myself grounded.
[186:24.89]I don't know.
[186:26.55]I was too nice.
[186:27.45]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[186:29.20]I'm just saying, hearing these incredibly nice things from all these people, I just want to make sure it doesn't get to my head and make me like an egotistical asshole.
[186:41.66]Because it happens to people.
[186:44.17]I just don't want to get there.
[186:45.37]And I hope I never do.
[186:47.27]I said this two streams ago.
[186:50.79]Hold me accountable always.
[186:54.27]For streams and for videos.
[186:57.63]You got to hold me accountable.
[186:58.77]I don't want to ever get to a position where I'm going to say whatever the fuck I want and do whatever I want and I don't care what you guys think.
[187:04.71]That's never going to happen.
[187:05.41]And if it does, then fucking tell me.
[187:07.96]Clip this and then fucking show it to me.
[187:11.18]And I'll have like, I'll have like a Scrooge.
[187:13.20]I'll have like an Ebenezer Scrooge moment where I'm like, oh, Bob, that's me.
[187:17.92]And then the fucking, the blood will fill my face again.
[187:24.02]Small head, big body, large hands.
[187:27.44]You guys know what I mean though.
[187:29.06]But thank you, Bluezy.
[187:31.97]I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.
[187:33.01]I hope you continue to watch.
[187:34.43]I hope you stick around.
[187:39.15]Cult of Personality, thank you for the $1.
[187:42.29]The new Splinter Cell game looks fucking fantastic.
[187:45.41]I like how it has Tracer as a DLC NPC.
[187:49.05]Have a great night.
[187:51.41]What are you talking about?
[187:52.55]Oh, you're talking about what we just did?
[187:53.61]Okay, for a second I thought there was an announcement that Ubisoft made.
[187:57.51]Like, Splinter Cell, take them down.
[188:00.49]Whatever the hell it would be.
[188:02.87]Thank you, though.
[188:05.53]Mr. Dr. Professor Nova, thanks for the $1.
[188:08.25]Jerma, this has been an amazing stream.
[188:09.55]I haven't laughed this much in forever.
[188:11.98]I'm really glad to hear that.
[188:15.42]Thank you.
[188:16.54]And also thanks to, like, Cricut and his friends.
[188:18.82]They were fun.
[188:19.68]They were funny to be around.
[188:22.94]Topac, thanks for the $1.
[188:24.30]Stop, please.
[188:25.08]I don't know what I was doing, but hopefully I stopped it.
[188:28.82]Camel, or Camler, thanks for the $1.
[188:32.46]Hey Jerma love stream.
[188:33.22]I've been in kind of a bad place lately, but you became the light on the dark side of me Love remained a drug.
[188:39.42]That's the high enough pill But did you know that when it snow is my eyes become large and the light that you shine can be seen I know that song that's seal.
[188:55.33]I actually know this one.
[188:56.37]I
[188:58.10]You guys can't pull Seal by me.
[188:59.93]He's a fucking classic.
[189:01.87]He is a classic musician.
[189:03.39]You're not going to be able to do that to me.
[189:06.03]Baited.
[189:06.43]No, I knew exactly what I was doing.
[189:08.33]Did you hear me hit that fucking note?
[189:09.59]Did you hear me hit that note?
[189:11.28]It was perfect.
[189:14.82]Anytime I get an ego, make sure you show me that clip.
[189:17.84]You know what I mean?
[189:18.70]Show me that clip of me saying that.
[189:22.23]But thanks.
[189:24.13]Also, thank you, David the Knights, for the $1.
[189:25.43]Hey, Jerma, woke up just to watch this stream.
[189:28.63]This stream is art.
[189:31.11]Thank you, David.
[189:32.48]Good morning.
[189:34.12]Or good night.
[189:34.58]Either one.
[189:37.14]Jordan Scales, thanks for the $1.
[189:38.80]Hi, Dad.
[189:39.28]How was work?
[189:40.18]It was great.
[189:41.68]Work was great.
[189:43.42]I love work.
[189:44.42]Work is fun.
[189:45.74]Work.
[189:47.37]Hyper Shadows won.
[189:48.11]Thanks for the $2.
[189:48.93]I haven't laughed this hard in years.
[189:51.43]Thank you, Jeremy.
[189:52.07]Well, thank you.
[189:54.35]I'm glad you found it enjoyable.
[189:57.82]Hey, here's to many more.
[189:59.54]Here's to many more streams.
[190:02.26]Here's to many more.
[190:03.36]Ding!
[190:03.74]How about you over there on the other side of the table?
[190:05.92]Of course.
[190:08.14]Thanks, guys.
[190:09.95]Eefs.
[190:11.33]Thank you, Eefs, for the $25. $25.
[190:15.08]Hey, Jerbo.
[190:16.28]Love ya.
[190:17.18]Have fun with Kryken and Bed.
[190:20.07]They're really great guys, and it looks like they're a lot of fun to play with.
[190:22.93]But they do roleplay.
[190:25.07]A lot is generally what they do, so heads up.
[190:27.97]Maybe I shouldn't have done, like, the Joker thing.
[190:30.49]They probably thought, like, after the first two rounds, they were probably just like, oh, who brought this dickhead that's not gonna play along?
[190:39.56]Who the fuck is this guy?
[190:42.40]Who invited him?
[190:44.47]We figured it out.
[190:44.97]Don't worry.
[190:47.03]And then Blue Z2.
[190:48.25]Blue Z2 again.
[190:49.62]From earlier.
[190:50.40]Thank you for the $10.
[190:50.88]And this is...
[190:54.80]We read this one, read the newest one first.
[190:58.58]So this is the one from earlier, from a couple hours ago.
[191:01.28]Thank you, Bluezy, for the $10 from earlier.
[191:04.35]Thanks for letting me start a freaking riot earlier in the stream.
[191:08.07]You've made my night twice over.
[191:10.45]This is only the second Jerma stream I've watched.
[191:12.85]Definitely going to be staying for a lot longer since you've always been a great guy to watch.
[191:15.57]Well, welcome.
[191:17.55]Stick around.
[191:18.16]There's more to see.
[191:19.80]I promise you that.
[191:22.18]Hopefully you find it entertaining.
[191:24.38]I hope.
[191:26.51]And with that, that is going to wrap it up.
[191:31.68]Uh, there actually, no, a couple came in a few minutes ago here.
[191:34.18]Tara.
[191:35.18]No!
[191:36.40]It's not Tara.
[191:38.10]It's not Tara.
[191:40.42]I've been corrected on this like three times.
[191:42.48]I don't know how many times I have to get corrected.
[191:53.21]I keep saying Tara.
[191:54.87]Tara.
[191:55.65]Oh, hold on.
[191:58.89]Sarah, they're here right now, and here we go.
[192:05.14]It was tar, right?
[192:09.66]I was gonna call you tar.
[192:13.28]Thank you for the $1, though.
[192:14.74]On the topic of accountability, a while ago you said you would try to release the remains of your game book.
[192:18.68]Whatever happened to that?
[192:21.13]I dumped, like,
[192:23.57]At least, like, 500 to... At least, like, 500 to 1,000 words in the chat.
[192:29.43]I dropped, like, 10 paragraphs in the chat, like, a couple weeks ago.
[192:36.00]That was, like, a month ago.
[192:37.16]I just dumped, like, probably, like, two or three pages.
[192:40.14]Like, two pages of content.
[192:42.24]What a book.
[192:43.66]That was a great book.
[192:47.30]Burn the book.
[192:49.14]1,000 words?
[192:49.52]Are you kidding?
[192:50.04]No, it is.
[192:50.41]Yes, I did.
[192:54.09]You did not.
[192:54.47]Yes, I did.
[192:56.63]It was before the stream.
[192:57.78]There was a stream that happened.
[192:58.96]Some of you guys are going to back me up on this one.
[193:02.56]I copy and pasted like 12 paragraphs into the chat before a stream started.
[193:09.06]I'll get the exact word count if you want.
[193:13.36]Finish it.
[193:14.56]Finish it.
[193:15.33]Do you know how fucking hard it is to write a book?
[193:19.57]It takes like years of dedication to write a book.
[193:23.08]And I went into this like, this would be fucking easy.
[193:25.76]I was going to write like fucking for an hour a night.
[193:27.88]And you know what happens when you write for an hour a night?
[193:30.30]You throw every idea in the trash a hundred times and you end up with like eight sentences.
[193:40.37]Yeah, years and he wrote a hundred words.
[193:42.05]That's not true.
[193:44.77]That's not true.
[193:46.97]There was at least like 1,000 to 2,000 words that I put into this chat.
[193:51.95]Like 2,000.
[193:52.67]Stephen King writes like 50 a year.
[193:56.85]And we got The Mist.
[194:01.26]I haven't worked on that book in a long time.
[194:05.70]That's the real story.
[194:07.84]But thank you.
[194:13.56]I write more than George RR Martini.
[194:16.40]I probably do.
[194:19.80]One to two K words is nothing.
[194:24.11]Yeah, it is.
[194:25.07]It's like 2,000 words.
[194:28.47]It's a lot of words.
[194:29.43]2,000 of them.
[194:31.11]You can't even put that... You can't put that many words in somebody's house.
[194:35.84]Go do it.
[194:36.98]Go get like 60 point font.
[194:40.96]Write the word like...
[194:42.71]graduation, 2,000 times.
[194:46.05]Get it at like 60-point font, cut it out, and try to fit it all in your house.
[194:50.74]It has to be on the ground.
[194:52.82]And I'm talking flat on the ground, right next to each other in a line.
[194:56.62]You're not going to be able to get that 2,000 words.
[194:58.88]You're not going to get that in your house.
[195:01.11]That's going to fill up your kitchen, your living room, your upstairs, your downstairs, your basement.
[195:05.11]You're going to have graduation in your basement.
[195:09.91]Kind of like me in real life.
[195:14.24]A is a word and stuff.
[195:15.42]No, it's not.
[195:15.98]It's got to be at least three letters.
[195:18.08]I tried to pull that shit back in college and I got sternly corrected.
[195:21.76]But, uh, 2A the... That happens like 500 million times.
[195:26.20]Yeah, that's... No, that don't work.
[195:27.54]It's got to be at least three and a half, four letters.
[195:37.03]I don't follow.
[195:45.97]Anyways.
[195:47.47]Thank you, Edgemont, for the $5.
[195:48.33]That was a hilarious stream.
[195:51.45]I burned through most of my bits with my previous donations.
[195:54.57]Gotta stop using my mother's credit card.
[195:56.71]Just kidding.
[195:57.33]Thank God.
[195:58.41]I gotta restock on some more.
[195:59.51]I appreciate everything you do for us.
[196:00.73]Love you.
[196:02.09]Appreciate everything you do for me, Edgemont.
[196:06.23]You know, like paying me money.
[196:09.99]That's a huge appreciation.
[196:11.49]That means a fucking lot.
[196:12.85]That's a big deal.
[196:16.16]Thank you.
[196:18.02]Asher108, thanks for the $5.
[196:19.26]I fucked up my last bit donation, so here's more.
[196:23.20]I honestly loved this stream and this chat and all the mods.
[196:28.81]They say, cap of pride.
[196:30.17]Bit sad I missed the beginning, but that end had me in tears.
[196:32.97]I love you.
[196:33.57]Scoff.
[196:35.35]Well, good thing you missed the beginning because it was fucking terrible.
[196:39.23]The two Zumbini sequels are trash.
[196:42.98]What a joke.
[196:47.55]And two more and we're going to take off with three more actually.
[196:50.00]Errolis000, thanks for the $10.
[196:55.06]That was fantastic.
[196:55.84]Keep doing what you're doing and thanks for being you.
[196:57.32]Happy holidays, buddy.
[196:58.64]Happy holidays, Errolis.
[197:02.86]Much love.
[197:05.26]And then Eaves again gave $14.
[197:07.46]Hey, Jeremy gave $25 earlier.
[197:11.87]And loving the love right now.
[197:13.53]I wanted to give more muns.
[197:16.23]You're amazing, dude.
[197:17.31]Keep up everything.
[197:18.41]Thank you.
[197:20.74]Thank you so much.
[197:22.40]You guys are fucking way too good to me.
[197:26.00]You guys are like the best children I've ever had.
[197:28.36]And some of you might even be older than me.
[197:29.72]So you're the best uncles and fathers and children and brothers and sisters that I've ever had.
[197:36.67]We're all a goddamn family.
[197:43.51]And with that, thank you so much, everybody.
[197:47.71]Tman5157515, thanks for the $5.05.
[197:50.73]And then Asha, again, for the $14.
[197:53.90]You're fucking spoiling the shit out of me.
[198:03.01]Have a good night, everybody.
[198:06.17]I'll see you on Tuesday.
[198:07.93]We'll do something fun.
[198:08.91]Figure it out.
[198:11.93]Have a good night.
[198:13.37]Good luck.
[198:16.24]And see you next time.
