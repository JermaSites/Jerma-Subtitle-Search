[00:11.26]Hey everybody, Lepter1 here, and Jerma.
[00:14.42]That's right.
[00:15.74]And we are back in the original spawn area, so I believe we must continue and find the place we were at.
[00:29.74]Yeah, we went, I think, way too far ahead of where we were supposed to go.
[00:36.00]Here, wait, let me just change my sensitivity really quick.
[00:38.98]Apparently you didn't retain it.
[00:41.67]Oh, one shot.
[00:43.13]One shot.
[00:45.53]Junobo.
[00:46.07]Oh, he's another little freak show.
[00:47.49]Oh, hello.
[00:48.29]Hi.
[00:48.99]Hi.
[00:49.59]Oh, boom.
[00:51.17]God, this gun reloads so fast, it's ridiculous.
[00:59.65]Okay, you can burn to death.
[01:02.59]You light him on fire.
[01:03.39]That's awesome.
[01:04.09]Yeah.
[01:05.15]Alright, so this is where we need to go, I believe.
[01:10.25]This time we'll actually follow the nice little diamond that it gives us.
[01:14.07]Yeah.
[01:15.05]I'm just, because right now I've only uploaded episodes 1, 2, and 3, and I'm just waiting for all the comments that are going to be like, you missed a diamond, you missed a diamond, you missed a diamond.
[01:25.04]5,000 comments saying you missed a diamond.
[01:27.88]Like, okay.
[01:29.16]Thank you.
[01:30.42]Captain Obvious.
[01:31.48]Okay, wait.
[01:35.48]Where do we need to order this vehicle from?
[01:40.00]Oh, man, you're right.
[01:42.63]Can't we just... How did we get through this last time?
[01:46.07]I feel like I already forget.
[01:48.35]Oh, we have to order that vehicle.
[01:50.47]From... Let's go.
[01:52.65]From... I don't know.
[01:53.66]Oh, maybe it's over here.
[01:57.46]I'm assuming that that gate... The gate switch is probably right on the other side of the gate.
[02:04.70]Open your mouth.
[02:05.95]Oh, wow.
[02:06.33]Since when do we have spitter skags here?
[02:12.89]open sesame oh come to papa no that's not good enough well take all this crap why not right yeah is it over here no it's not here wait let me look at the mission thing that we have
[02:34.84]Yeah, I think that whatever vehicle we end up getting, I'm pretty positive that it's like... Well, this thing, the difficulty is trivial.
[02:46.42]Alright, we have to go over here, I believe.
[02:51.03]Oh, we already got this turn.
[02:52.19]We just gotta turn this in, huh?
[02:54.59]Yeah, I just don't know where it is.
[02:59.15]Oh, hello, I'm getting shot at.
[03:06.56]I gotta love every single shot being a crit.
[03:10.80]Oh, let's go, let's go.
[03:12.34]Oh, come on, whatchu know.
[03:16.17]Go down, man.
[03:17.01]It's like three headshots in a row.
[03:27.21]Wow.
[03:27.90]How did my health get so low?
[03:30.14]These guys are... I have a headshot right there.
[03:36.07]Wow, we just killed the bone guy.
[03:38.06]Did we really?
[03:40.14]I think so.
[03:43.96]What's this little trophy?
[03:46.14]Oh wait, where is this place that we have to go to?
[03:49.58]Is that better than what you got?
[03:51.73]No, I have that already.
[03:53.07]Oh, you already got that, alright.
[03:54.41]I'll take it though.
[03:54.97]Remember how much trouble that guy gave us?
[03:58.59]Where is this place?
[04:00.63]Like, the place that we need to go to.
[04:02.81]Did I just hop that?
[04:03.65]That would have been awesome if I did.
[04:06.21]Yeah, I think we just need to go back and turn that in.
[04:08.15]What's wrong with me?
[04:10.45]Yeah, I think we're missing a... When we jumped that thing, I think we were just supposed to turn around and open the door.
[04:19.55]But the diamond says to go somewhere else, and I set the focus on it, and it says the difficulty is trivial.
[04:25.79]Plus, I need to get this health pack right here.
[04:32.52]uh... to the left to the left to the left here I'm just gonna go ahead and turn this in really quick cool still people back here what?
[04:42.87]oi oi oi this job board silly job board there they are alright
[04:51.06]Alright, get a little blood on the tires.
[04:52.70]Scooter's letting you drive as runners, huh?
[04:54.62]You know what's fun?
[04:55.30]Road killing.
[04:55.84]Running over every little thing that's stupid enough to wander in front of your grill.
[04:59.63]I bet you're squeamish, though.
[05:00.85]I bet good money you haven't got the guts to go road killing yourself.
[05:05.15]Okay, so there's that, and then there's this tough one.
[05:07.45]Let's take the get a little blood on the tires one.
[05:11.14]And I'll set the focus on that.
[05:13.94]Okay, there we go.
[05:15.00]Track that.
[05:16.18]So let's... Oh, wow.
[05:18.26]Why did I do that?
[05:19.60]Uh...
[05:21.61]Why are these guys already back?
[05:28.84]I'm missing legitimately every shot.
[05:30.54]Behind us too.
[05:31.18]There's like skags behind us.
[05:35.25]No scope.
[05:36.07]You know about no scope.
[05:40.59]Gotta love ammo that's for me that you get.
[05:45.45]There's money around here.
[05:50.86]There you go.
[05:51.52]Yeah, I think we need to go all the way over there, yeah.
[05:54.98]We're gonna pick up this money right here.
[05:57.38]You know, since I can always just... I guess somebody said in the comment section that we share money, but we don't share money when we spend it.
[06:07.51]We share the revenue, but we don't share the actual use of the money.
[06:12.00]Yeah.
[06:12.78]So that's pretty cool.
[06:13.58]So where do we have to go now?
[06:17.22]So this is the thing we jumped, right?
[06:18.83]Oh, no.
[06:19.27]There's like a... Didn't we, like, jump more like some... Oh, no, no, no.
[06:22.77]The jump is over here.
[06:24.07]Okay, okay.
[06:24.81]Here, this makes more sense.
[06:31.14]So... The question is... Can we get over this without the vehicle?
[06:39.94]I don't think so.
[06:43.03]Yeah, about that.
[06:44.83]You see over to the right?
[06:46.51]That's where we had to go.
[06:49.26]Right over there.
[06:50.34]Wonderful.
[06:51.78]I wonder if we can... And we made it all the way.
[06:54.20]You see those towers in the distance?
[06:56.76]Yeah, that's where we ended up.
[06:59.02]Alright, wait.
[06:59.76]We just have to find where this... You know what you should try?
[07:02.33]Try doing your super romp and jumping it.
[07:04.87]Ah, ha, ha.
[07:05.83]Watch me die again.
[07:07.53]It might actually work.
[07:08.75]No.
[07:10.65]You get the timing right.
[07:13.08]Because I can't jump.
[07:14.40]That's why.
[07:14.82]Oh, okay.
[07:18.78]Where's the vehicle guy?
[07:20.78]Where's Scooter?
[07:21.56]His name is Scooter.
[07:23.15]If we can spawn one of those vehicles, we should be able to do it again.
[07:25.67]Yeah.
[07:32.83]Where the hell was it?
[07:36.86]Who knows?
[07:39.48]Yeah, we did that a while ago.
[07:41.86]Is it over here?
[07:46.38]Wait, I see something.
[07:49.06]It says either or.
[07:51.52]I don't think that's the one.
[07:54.26]But it just might be this.
[07:57.02]The travel station?
[08:01.60]There we go.
[08:02.28]Alright.
[08:05.46]So now, we should be able to do this.
[08:07.66]Wait, where's the car?
[08:08.54]I just spawned it.
[08:10.59]Here, take out those enemies.
[08:13.59]Where they at?
[08:17.05]There we go.
[08:17.48]Spawn vehicle.
[08:18.82]Wait, teleport to driver's seat.
[08:21.24]Okay, get in.
[08:22.60]Out of it.
[08:24.72]Oh, I gotta take care of these guys.
[08:27.24]Boom.
[08:29.72]Boom.
[08:31.46]Okay.
[08:32.59]So... Let's see if we can bust through this.
[08:36.15]No, we're gonna have to jump the jump and then come back around here and open the gate.
[08:40.65]Steve's ridiculously difficult to drive so I can't believe we actually did that's why people are gonna people are gonna rip into us bad for that that almost happened again alright wait I just need to check something really quickly no no no don't invert controls bad idea I'm going this way I think I'm pretty positive that it's back here we just have to open this gate alright wait I just need to see how to
[09:11.76]Wait a second.
[09:13.04]Vehicle horn.
[09:14.10]I need to know this.

[09:21.48]Okay, I'm going to run over you.
[09:23.78]Sorry.
[09:27.60]I was going for one of those in the air hits.
[09:29.86]Oh, look at that beep.
[09:31.24]I love that beep.
[09:31.96]That beep is awesome.
[09:32.84]This is definitely where we had to go.
[09:34.22]See, there's the gate.
[09:35.18]Yeah, okay.
[09:36.12]Wow, we are so dumb.
[09:37.48]Alright, wait, watch out.
[09:39.26]I will do this.

[13:52.07]There's stuff in here, too.
[13:54.47]Ammo.
[13:56.77]Alright, let's get out of here.

[14:05.27]Maybe we have to go through that portal.
[14:06.89]Alright, Legit says it's right here.
[14:09.69]Oh, here it is.
[14:10.23]He's right there.
[14:10.68]He's standing right there.
[14:12.66]Oh, no.
[14:13.62]He gave us the check.
[14:14.36]Now all we have to do is turn in.
[14:17.14]Really?

[14:19.74]There we go.
[14:20.66]Okay, what's that?

[14:40.67]So which one do you want to do?
[14:43.37]I just want to go turn this quest in first.
[14:46.07]I think we already got it turned in.
[14:49.82]Here, check our quest log.
[14:52.48]Yeah, we got to...
