[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.87]I'm back.
[00:03.76]Yo.
[00:08.54]Uh, I'm getting kind of like tired.
[00:11.46]Not sure about like the rest of the stream.
[00:13.56]I'm thinking I might take like a Take a little bit take a break or something get a little bit sleep and uh
[00:21.87]Believers win.
[00:28.53]Okay, let's open it.
[00:29.64]The last thing we did in Withering Rooms, if you remember, is we were on our way to kill the first witch.
[00:40.45]Can you have two games open on Steam at the same time?
[00:51.48]Like, if I open this, will it...
[00:54.18]Does Steam not let you do that?
[01:00.30]Okay.
[01:00.48]Okay.
[01:01.93]I think it worked.
[01:04.47]It did.
[01:15.21]I'll turn it up
[01:29.11]Okay, 1.8 billion.
[01:31.27]Hold on, let me just do a little bit.
[01:32.21]Let me just get some stuff.
[01:33.44]Hold on one sec.
[01:38.26]Give me one second.
[01:43.46]you
[02:05.62]Let me just upgrade a couple things real quick.
[02:11.34]Thank you.
[02:24.90]Just to get it going.
[02:25.61]Just to get it going.
[02:26.31]I guess somebody's got to get it going.
[02:34.64]Just to get it moving.
[02:38.97]Okay.
[02:39.77]Alright, I'm done with that.
[02:44.65]Wait, does it have to be on screen to have it work?
[02:48.20]Oh shit, it has to be...
[02:48.93]I think it has to be visible on a screen.
[02:52.59]I'll put it in my other monitor.
[03:01.86]Alright, let's go.
[03:10.28]So I got the dog.
[03:11.17]I have no ammo for anything.
[03:22.84]I don't know if that's gonna cut it though.
[03:30.60]And... Where is the...
[03:33.23]I gotta go to the cathedral.
[03:40.60]If he mysteriously stops playing this to play the dice game on the other monitor, I'm pausing the timer.
[03:46.85]Oh, shit.
[03:47.43]Okay.
[03:48.82]Well, that's good because I'm going to be focusing 100% on here.
[04:00.75]Alright, I need a mirror.
[04:08.95]How am I doing on gear?
[04:09.89]I think my gear's fine.
[04:17.51]That was almost convincing that you gave a shit.
[04:20.51]Huh?
[04:23.32]What are you talking about?
[04:26.93]I don't know.
[04:38.30]I need more heals.
[04:41.05]Gimme this shit, yeah.
[04:44.43]Gimme some tubes.
[04:46.13]How about some- yeah.
[04:47.16]Acid.
[04:49.89]I'm going full acid throw and gun.
[04:55.40]What is my stream title?
[04:56.65]Does it still say it's the Terminator?
[05:01.45]Thank you.
[05:11.34]Spear versus sword, I don't know.
[05:17.59]I got three of these.
[05:18.43]I think I can kill her.
[05:21.33]I have a lot of food.
[05:22.20]Yeah, I should do it.
[05:23.16]I'll be fine.
[05:26.60]It's gonna be so sad if I don't kill her though.
[05:30.88]Alright, I need a crafting table.
[05:35.18]Please.
[05:37.43]Is it still activatable?
[05:38.82]It is.
[05:39.44]Um, let me make some money here first.
[05:43.72]Where can I go?
[06:03.47]Okay, I'm ready to fight the witch.
[06:09.49]I'm gonna put projectiles on the right bar.
[06:18.55]Okay, I definitely want more of that.
[06:22.58]More of that.
[06:25.84]Let's get this correct.
[06:28.90]I got plenty of bullets.
[06:30.50]I got a grenade.
[06:31.20]I got three acids.
[06:35.53]I have 11 heals.
[06:37.21]I'm just fine.
[06:38.80]I have a melee weapon, right?
[06:39.93]I do.
[06:42.33]The spear, I think, is a little bit better.
[06:43.44]Alright, yeah, I'm ready.
[06:45.68]Let's go kick the witch's ass.
[06:53.69]I'm gonna hold the shotgun for the last part.
[06:55.67]If I don't need it, I do.
[06:56.78]Alright, here we go.
[07:03.06]Where...
[07:07.56]Where is the...
[07:11.12]It's been a while.
[07:11.85]Where was it?
[07:14.02]Where's the cathedral?
[07:22.12]East Forest Dock.
[07:23.28]Is it the dock?
[07:25.02]Labyrinth Market.
[07:29.70]Labyrinth Prison...
[07:31.53]I forget where it was.
[07:33.44]Not the cottages, right?
[07:39.49]Oh, here it is, yeah.
[07:41.52]So it's out here, east stairwell, and just keep going.
[07:45.11]Do I have...
[07:45.53]I don't have a... No, it doesn't exist.
[07:47.22]Alright, so east stairwell to the right.
[08:01.04]Oh, dude, it's by the diamond dice skill tree.
[08:03.97]Oh.
[08:05.88]Uh, quick little update.
[08:06.60]We just crossed a billion again on the dice game.
[08:24.68]I do have the dog, that's right.
[08:30.73]The dog is sick.
[08:35.16]Almost there.
[08:36.47]I'm surprised there's not a mirror over here.
[08:39.83]Alright, let's go.
[08:57.37]Speak to the witch!
[09:00.68]Now who would you be?
[09:01.99]Another poor soul seeking refuge from Mostyn House?
[09:07.12]I have brought my witches here to the end of the dream.
[09:10.40]We seek the false prophet, Robert Blackett.
[09:14.88]He claims to be constructing a Paradise, but says that Paradise has no room for witches.
[09:20.02]Unacceptable, particularly after we served him so dutifully these many years.
[09:26.71]Answer my questions truthfully, child, and perhaps there is a place for you here.
[09:31.12]Are you in league with Robert Blackett?
[09:36.79]No.
[09:39.64]I think we are.
[09:44.64]Are there two outcomes here?
[09:45.72]If I say yes or no?
[09:51.50]What happens if I say no?
[09:53.69]I don't think I am No Do you know where Robert Blackett is?
[10:04.53]I don't think so.
[10:05.81]I mean, no, I think I do.
[10:07.84]He's over there in the tower, right?
[10:11.15]Yes, I know where he is.
[10:13.42]I knew it.
[10:14.97]What?
[10:28.74]Did I fuck it up?
[10:39.34]No, we progressed.
[10:46.37]Strange church office.
[10:53.50]I thought that was a boss fight.
[10:54.74]Maybe I fought it in my other playthrough.
[11:04.81]It's gotta be a hidden door.
[11:05.94]Yeah.
[11:15.39]Freeze.
[11:17.60]Priscilla's room.
[11:22.00]I know you.
[11:22.64]You're Nightingale from around 1892, right?
[11:27.35]Don't be surprised, I know just about everything about the dream.
[11:30.84]I've been dead since 1874, so I've had a lot of time to study it.
[11:36.16]Being trapped here for decades has made my world quite small.
[11:41.07]I'm Priscilla Mostyn.
[11:42.80]I'm sure you've met my brother Peter.
[11:45.13]The First Witch has trapped us both here, accusing us of being in league with Robert Blackett.
[11:50.42]Unfortunately, I have never been able to use magic in the dream.
[11:53.73]I suppose I lack a certain suspension of disbelief necessary for it.
[11:57.57]You, however, could defeat the first witch and get us both out of here.
[12:01.89]I know you are quite talented.
[12:03.80]Here is the Saint Eli's Key.
[12:05.89]You can use it to escape and face the first witch.
[12:08.52]Before you go, if you have any questions about the dream or even your own future, I will answer them.
[12:14.36]Who am I?
[12:16.09]This may be hard to hear.
[12:17.25]You are the dream's interpretation of Nightingale from when she first came to Mostyn House in 1892.
[12:25.50]Later, you showed exceptional talent as a witch and rapidly became Robert Blackett's assistant.
[12:31.86]Unfortunately, Robert has a tendency to break his favorite toys.
[12:38.01]Due to your frequent exposure to the dream, your body and the real world entered into a coma.
[12:43.78]I'm not sure if you're still alive, or if you still live, but it's entirely possible.
[12:48.76]You'd be nearly 40 years old.
[12:51.42]In the dream, you disappeared long with half a dozen other girls.
[12:55.67]I suspect you were taken by Robert to his new Paradise and likely still serve him.
[13:01.04]If you were to somehow wake from your coma, I'm not exactly sure whose conscious experience would be embodied,
[13:09.24]I do hope it's the Nightingale I'm speaking to now, as the later iterations are significantly less pleasant.
[13:16.09]Robert Blackett is a sick man.
[13:19.48]Dude, you hear that?
[13:20.50]Look at how crazy this is.
[13:25.05]Thousands of years ago, a primitive society either created or discovered the idol.
[13:29.88]I'm not sure which.
[13:31.58]Each new moon, anything the idol's eyes had seen would be incorporated into a new dream.
[13:38.00]As was customary in those ancient days, blood sacrifices were regularly made to the idol.
[13:43.97]Being one of the idols' formative experiences, I believe these sacrifices explain the power blood holds in the dream.
[13:51.95]The idol was lost for some time and rediscovered in old Byzantium.
[13:56.69]There it served as an imaginary pleasure house and arena for the rich and noble.
[14:02.08]The remnants of that era can still be found beneath Mostyn House.
[14:06.76]Much later, as you know, my brother purchased the idol and brought it back to Mostyn House.
[14:11.53]Later, I later discovered that all of those old iterations occupied physical space in the dream and still existed.
[14:19.71]Curiously though, they were devoid of life.
[14:23.02]Through careful application of electromagnetic stimulation to idols in the dream, I discovered the iterations could be restarted.
[14:30.61]You are a product of those experiments.
[14:33.73]The 1892 Four Nightingale that was brought back to life.
[14:43.25]We're getting a lore dump here.
[14:44.50]You came here to 1916 via a cable car, right?
[14:51.01]I gave the schematics to Robert.
[14:53.79]He had it built in the real world and showed it to the idol.
[14:56.94]We used to have cable cars running to every iteration of the dream.
[15:00.83]Robert had one of the witches use some sort of magic to create copies of the cable cars and tunnels to speed up the work.
[15:07.92]The undead were brought here en masse via the cable cars and used as copious source of organ grease.
[15:15.25]Ultimately, Robert found some other way to get organ grease, but he wouldn't tell me, since the many iterations of the dream we were harvesting from were no longer necessary.
[15:24.90]I detached the electromagnetic stimulation device from all of the idols we collected from each iteration.
[15:32.61]Dermot, if you had a trolley problem, would you pull the lever to kill Gandalf or not pull the lever to kill all the hobbits?
[15:40.65]Um...
[16:04.88]Hey, we're back.
[16:07.11]I just went off on a huge thing about Gandalf.
[16:10.97]What did you miss?
[16:16.45]I talked for about, uh, how long did I talk about Gandalf?
[16:19.39]You missed the whole thing?
[16:21.50]Oh, goddammit, really?
[16:27.25]I went off on a whole thing.
[16:28.32]I said I would kill all the hobbits because you need Gandalf, but then I backtracked and I said,
[16:33.99]wouldn't the hobbits... Bilbo Baggins was kind of chosen by God, in a way.
[16:38.58]Or, you know, the...
[16:40.13]Said a whole thing and I was like eventually he would figure out there'd be like a fucking thing written in the clouds Because like they would they had to have Bilbo do I don't know I would fucking keep the hobbits alive.
[16:48.72]I
[16:52.19]Anyways, I explained the whole thing and it was actually intelligent.
[17:01.17]Okay.
[17:02.13]Each iteration went dark and the tunnels and cable cars were dismantled.
[17:05.91]Curiously, there was a single missing idol, the one for iteration 1892-4.
[17:14.44]Furthermore, at the 1892-4 tunnel, entrance had disappeared.
[17:18.75]I suppose now that you're here, we all know it's still running.
[17:23.40]Let's go kill that witch.
[17:27.43]Find a way to the first witch in the church.
[17:31.52]Don't touch that, please.
[17:37.76]I'm evil.
[17:38.96]I'm evil.
[17:40.61]I'm evil.
[17:41.40]I'm evil.
[17:41.94]I'm evil.
[17:42.59]I'm evil.
[17:43.19]I'm evil.
[17:55.95]Get all the items.
[18:05.41]Hello?
[18:06.72]Who was that?
[18:10.88]That didn't even attack!
[18:11.70]It didn't even hit!
[18:15.73]Oh, you, okay.
[18:24.96]Don't stab me with that necrosis.
[18:36.43]What is going on with you?
[18:37.36]Why can I not hit you with this?
[18:38.89]You just kicked me in the face with this dirty ass foot.
[18:41.48]Alright.
[18:54.23]Well, there's lots of items to get.
[18:56.16]I need to get more ammo.
[19:06.30]Anybody in here?
[19:11.67]I have four bullets left.
[19:12.84]What are you talking about?
[19:16.12]That's fine.
[19:19.65]How's the dice game going?
[19:20.96]Uh...
[19:22.55]3.2 billion money and almost 1 million dark matter.
[19:38.43]There's something in Priscilla's room still.
[19:45.46]How's the audio?
[19:46.02]Audio good?
[19:46.74]Can it be raised, lowered?
[19:47.75]How is it?
[19:50.31]Damn it.
[19:51.96]Spell damage.
[19:55.99]It's good?
[19:56.56]Okay.
[20:05.75]Did I miss something in here?
[20:17.14]I think it's the switch.
[20:21.98]Permanent lab manual.
[20:23.08]Contains flaming grease, cutting grease, and poison grease.
[20:27.45]Oh, it's a mail.
[20:28.38]It's like a fire paper.
[20:40.07]There's something so funny about Gandalf being tied to a railway like a maiden.
[20:54.08]No.
[20:55.24]Fool.
[20:57.15]Paul will never save me.
[20:59.76]No, I can't get out of these bounds.
[21:01.76]I've...
[21:02.75]Bilbo!
[21:03.96]Bilbo, save me, not the other hobbits!
[21:07.31]Ah, and the one who gave us all the advice.
[21:12.63]I have all the magical spells, Bilbo.
[21:16.18]Don't... not pull the lever and kill yourself, apparently, because you're laying down.
[21:22.13]on it as well!
[21:24.48]Who's the main character in this story?
[21:26.21]I don't know who that's supposed to be.
[21:42.75]Alright, I can fight.
[21:49.80]Wait, there's something in there.
[21:58.12]Yeah, Bilbo, pull the lever and then go tie yourself up on the tracks!
[22:06.07]Do I have anything else to remember?
[22:09.46]No, just don't die.
[22:16.60]Oh shit.
[22:18.55]Do I even have enough to damage?
[22:21.26]Hold on a minute.
[22:23.03]Um...
[22:25.10]I'm going to go...
[22:26.54]I'm going to go buy some ammo.
[22:30.36]It's a coward move.
[22:31.02]It's fine.
[22:31.56]I don't care.
[22:38.06]I don't know, I just see Gandalf kind of with like loosely tied legs up, kicking it around.
[22:44.15]They're too strong!
[22:46.62]You know, they're not that tight.
[22:48.07]He's able to kind of kick them around.
[22:57.77]It's not really that tight at all.
[22:59.76]He could probably get out if he just tried.
[23:01.39]Okay, I want...
[23:10.40]Is he in danger though or not at all?
[23:12.77]He would be... he's playing along.
[23:14.22]Yeah, that's how I think about it.
[23:18.63]I can...
[23:19.72]I need to upgrade my shit.
[23:22.49]Where is that guy?
[23:23.25]I'm gonna upgrade the chest like six times.
[23:27.10]Why would he be playing along?
[23:29.89]I don't know.
[23:31.73]He's the sick fuck that made it all happen.
[23:39.49]Dude, I so badly want an alternate universe of Lord of the Rings.
[23:45.47]Alternate universe where Gandalf is the evil.
[23:49.46]Imagine how fucking crazy that would be if you had a Gandalf evil retelling of the Lord of the Rings.
[23:58.91]because Sauron I think he should be a good guy in the next one
[24:16.56]You never have any projectile shit for me.
[24:19.83]Hisses me off.
[24:27.70]Chug, chug, chug.
[24:39.06]Hello, hello, hello.
[24:40.86]Hearthstone!
[24:54.13]Fuck off.
[25:01.25]Fuck you!
[25:05.97]Hey, I got it right.
[25:11.13]Okay, I'm ready to fight.
[25:14.64]I got so much acid.
[25:18.90]I earned 10 billion dollars in the dice game.
[25:37.50]Don't hurt me.
[25:40.74]Don't!
[25:48.82]Yeah, it's pretty simple.
[25:51.51]Just clean the place.
[25:54.19]And don't touch my clay over there.
[25:56.66]I'm making a sculpture for my landlord's birthday.
[26:06.30]Anybody know what the fuck that is?
[26:07.93]There's no way anybody knows what that is.
[26:18.47]Thank you.
[26:26.52]There's this cute animated little thing that I was watching.
[26:31.90]I like it.
[26:32.80]It's cute.
[26:34.09]It's called Grimaldus is the name of the little character.
[26:37.32]I don't even know how old this thing is, but I was like, oh, this is cute.
[26:39.53]I like this.
[26:41.67]You can watch it on YouTube.
[26:43.86]Like little, a little like two to three minute little short animations.
[26:47.05]They're cool.
[26:47.38]They're cute.
[26:48.64]I like them.
[26:59.66]I keep forgetting I need to spend money on this.
[27:09.33]Alright, sell everything and then level up one more time agility and then kill the witch.
[27:24.57]Look at all these fingers I have.
[27:28.77]Do I have any pictures I could sell?
[27:30.95]I don't want to use any more ammo
[27:41.38]I don't care about this.
[27:42.76]We're at the end game.
[27:44.67]I don't care about that either.
[27:53.47]I don't care about this How can you tell that he's high?
[28:03.18]I'm not on any foreign substances.
[28:11.29]What more do I have to say to have you understand that
[28:28.47]35 coins.
[28:47.26]Oh, I can sell that to him.
[28:52.37]Make sure to join us tomorrow.
[28:54.18]Ster and I are going to be playing a sponsored segment for about two hours.
[28:58.26]And then we're going to play something else.
[28:59.38]Where's the guy to sell the pictures to?
[29:02.32]Is he not in here?
[29:03.17]I think he's somewhere else.
[29:04.16]Eh, whatever.
[29:08.52]I need 35 bucks.
[29:20.50]I might need that later.
[29:28.51]Hey, okay, level up one more time, then get out of here.
[29:39.82]Is they're gonna say something completely out of pocket and ruin the sponsor?
[29:44.23]No.
[29:51.67]Alright, I'm ready.
[29:53.94]I'm all...
[29:54.84]I'm all jazzed up.
[30:07.16]I'm all jazzed up.
[30:08.59]Let's go.
[30:13.99]¶¶
[30:22.28]It's time to kill the beast.
[30:24.11]We'll kill the beast.
[30:25.77]Through the mist, through the woods, through the darkness and the shadows.
[30:29.26]It's a nightmare, but it's one exciting ride.
[30:44.64]Nice theater kid.
[30:48.21]Well, a theater kid would know the rest of the lyrics except for the first two sentences.
[30:53.58]Through the mist, through the woods, through the darkness and the... A creature feasts upon the first witch.
[30:59.93]A small door lies behind them.
[31:02.64]Step past the creature.
[31:04.53]Get the fuck out of my way.
[31:07.23]Oh my god, it's the blood-starved beast!
[31:12.79]Oh my fucking god!
[31:14.25]This thing is crazy!
[31:17.18]Um... How do I get out of here?
[31:31.96]I haven't even been able to attack once.
[31:40.62]Excuse me?
[31:49.54]Shoot!
[32:02.33]Okay.
[32:03.94]Whoa.
[32:07.93]I gotta pull out the big guns now.
[32:19.80]Give me a break, you had invincibility frames.
[32:30.01]Dodge through!
[32:30.85]Reload the fucking gun!
[32:37.12]Can't even reload!
[32:56.21]Dude, you get hit once, it's fucking over.
[33:05.00]I don't remember this being this crazy.
[33:10.71]Just lock in already?
[33:11.77]Alright.
[33:14.66]Here we go.
[33:32.95]Think that one's good.
[33:38.75]Lookin' for curse protection.
[33:44.34]That's good.
[33:45.16]That's not good.
[34:01.89]Less curse rot damage might be good.
[34:20.20]Mmm.
[34:23.97]Maybe the Mac.
[34:24.43]Maybe this one here.
[34:28.03]OK. Has one more ring I can put on.
[34:35.94]Max health maybe.
[34:41.58]And then something to, let's see, what about curse?
[34:45.88]Perception.
[34:46.48]Less poison.
[34:47.96]Poison.
[34:51.57]uh no what happened is fine projectiles less terror build up no spell till no
[35:00.97]That's poison.
[35:04.16]What am I wearing right now, this?
[35:07.21]I don't need to do damage, I need to live.
[35:14.60]Paralysis.
[35:16.84]Projectiles.
[35:22.50]There we go.
[35:24.53]Less curse-raunt, less curse.
[35:28.88]Alright, I'm ready!
[35:38.23]I'm gonna block all that shit.
[35:40.12]I'm using the spell damage blocking...
[35:43.32]Wait.
[35:47.16]I want to be remembered like this.
[36:06.76]That actually helps.
[36:09.28]Dude, why am I shooting the other way?
[36:10.82]I didn't even fucking press the button.
[36:14.24]Oh my fucking god, she blocks everything!
[36:17.15]Am I gonna have to throw a grenade at her?
[36:28.74]Come on.
[36:41.04]Come on, fuck off with that.
[37:01.41]Oh my fucking lord!
[37:03.44]All the damage is insane.
[37:16.98]Oh, you jump over my shit.
[37:18.26]Come on.
[37:28.83]Oh my God, there's no iframes.
[37:32.55]How did I beat this before?
[37:33.80]I don't even know how the fuck I did this.
[37:52.13]Dude, what the fuck?
[37:54.34]What is happening?
[37:55.18]Dodge the projectiles.
[37:59.54]There are no iframes.
[38:04.15]This is fucking fried!
[38:05.94]I don't remember this being this crazy!
[38:31.45]I wonder, maybe she's weak to fire.
[38:46.77]Don't fuck off with that.
[38:48.16]Stop putting that shield.
[38:49.21]It's fucking dog shit.
[38:50.26]I'm sorry.
[38:50.82]What the fuck is that?
[39:00.17]I think it's just to eat every item in your inventory.
[39:08.14]Do I have anything that can remove curse really quickly?
[39:14.94]Oh my goodness, dude.
[39:25.32]Maybe this is melee.
[39:26.33]I don't think I can even have enough time to shoot you.
[39:36.81]I think it's just eat everything in your inventory and try to get the damage out.
[39:56.52]Fuck you.
[40:00.29]Did it even hit her?
[40:15.33]I wonder if I just melee.
[40:17.35]I don't think I can even hit it.
[40:27.70]Do I need to level up like 10 more times?
[40:29.92]This feels crazy.
[40:40.43]I'll just keep the curse rod on.
[40:41.69]I just have to heal through it.
[40:50.43]Get that fucking shield out of here.
[41:03.06]I can do it.
[41:12.39]What the fuck?
[41:31.66]I can't reload the gun.
[41:33.61]There's not enough time.
[41:36.18]You die if you reload the gun.
[41:40.32]Fucking projectile Andy didn't work well against this boss.
[41:46.67]Do I need more heals?
[41:56.38]Fucking stop!
[42:20.23]I don't have any more heals.
[42:24.74]I guess I have a roll.
[42:36.34]Get that shit out of here!
[42:39.59]Any more shit in my inventory?
[42:42.36]Oh wait, I got fucking bugs!
[42:44.85]I don't have bugs.
[42:50.35]If I had more heals, I'd be able to do it.
[42:55.57]Shit.
[42:57.35]You gotta come in here with a fuckload of heals.
[43:02.09]Can I put the rolls in my inventory, please?
[43:04.89]Oh, I can't eat while I've already eaten way too much.
[43:14.26]I'm dead.
[43:15.62]That's GG.
[43:19.66]Okay.
[43:20.44]I'm just gonna have a hundred heals.
[43:23.87]I'll be back.
[43:26.97]I need to outspell her?
[43:27.99]I have no points in spells.
[43:32.59]Do I even have any curse removing food?
[43:37.72]I guess this is like a cupcake I could eat.
[43:49.78]Alright, I need 10 more of these and I'm good to go.
[43:56.67]And I want more shotgun shells.
[43:57.91]The shotgun will just obliterate her.
[44:00.54]Alright, I know what I'm doing.
[44:02.69]I got a game plan.
[44:03.30]Let's go.
[44:10.10]Gonna get some money?
[44:22.77]What's down?
[44:23.23]What is even in here?
[44:24.60]Oh, that door.
[44:27.21]I think I have to get out out.
[44:28.80]Yeah, I do.
[44:31.85]Her whole health bar is like 10 shotgun shells.
[44:34.82]Yeah.
[44:35.51]I'm gonna go back and grind at that place to get shotgun.
[44:42.06]And then I'll come back with a full magazine of shotgun-able bullets.
[45:01.96]Uh, I have ten billion dollars in the dice game and two million, um, uh, dark matter.
[45:22.58]Get rid of that.
[45:25.26]Okay.
[45:27.07]Let me do this.
[45:33.85]Because I have to go to the place with the, um, like the war stuff.
[45:45.10]Okay, I'm gonna grind here for a little bit.
[45:47.53]I want to get plenty of items.
[45:51.11]I'm gonna get a bunch of money as well.
[45:56.63]The boss has a secret.
[45:57.47]If you slap her five times, it's over.
[45:59.22]Press X to doubt.
[46:19.19]I should be able to get some gunpowder here.
[46:20.49]Yeah, there we go.
[46:21.66]That's a ton.
[46:30.46]Oh my god!
[46:40.76]I don't want to use the gun yet because it's gonna alert everybody.
[46:46.35]You know what?
[46:46.97]I'm gonna have to.
[46:47.83]No, I have this.
[46:48.80]I can do that.
[46:51.76]You fucking weirdo!
[47:03.10]What are you all doing in here?
[47:05.17]Get out of here!
[47:09.74]I need shotgun shells.
[47:19.18]Ow.
[47:24.79]I think I technically have them, right?
[47:27.78]What are you all doing in here?
[47:31.48]Why are they all rushing me?
[47:33.45]I don't understand.
[47:40.34]Why are they all rushing me?
[47:43.28]Why are they all here?
[47:44.49]I didn't do anything!
[47:53.61]Why are they all...
[48:04.93]Alright, don't go in there.
[48:10.67]That's good.
[48:11.43]How many more acid jars do I have?
[48:14.04]Enough.
[48:17.74]Those are very susceptible to acid.
[48:33.97]Ooh!
[48:35.70]Had that before.
[48:36.30]I think I have enough to get what I need.
[48:45.99]Don't move.
[48:54.22]I thought it said projectile damage.
[48:55.79]I was about to be very happy.
[48:59.61]I have a picture.
[49:00.11]I have a camera, right?
[49:03.22]I do.
[49:08.63]Gotcha.
[49:15.89]I haven't really expended very much ammo at all.
[49:19.24]In fact I think it's none.
[49:26.57]I think we're approaching time.
[49:28.46]Believers are about to win, so congratulations, Believers.
[49:32.60]I told you.
[49:34.51]Always listen to me.
[49:42.03]Okay.
[49:52.54]So... Let's see what I can make now.
[49:59.76]I hate it.
[50:09.79]I tried to duck.
[50:15.68]Can I make a bunch of shotgun shells now?
[50:20.56]Okay, she's... she's dead.
[50:27.05]I'm making a ton of fire jars too.
[50:31.36]I have maximum ammo here.
[50:33.04]I need...
[50:34.75]Okay, I need two more gunpowder.
[50:39.46]And I'll have max shotgun.
[50:41.12]And I think that'll do it.
[50:48.48]Let me go...
[50:50.73]Get some more money.
[51:00.26]So,
[51:07.32]What do you have?
[51:07.98]Oh yeah, that's fine.
[51:09.55]Alright, I'm gonna go get a little bit more cash.
[51:23.55]because I want to make
[51:25.56]I actually might be able to sell some stuff.
[51:26.72]I want to make at least another 5 to 10 heals.
[51:31.42]And then I think I got all, look at all the shotgun shells I have.
[51:33.71]I'm going to obliterate her.
[51:38.86]I don't need any of this shit.
[51:45.49]I can make three more heals right now.
[52:02.09]That should be pretty great too.
[52:05.68]I can get these back if I need them, don't worry.
[52:09.20]I don't care about spell damage.
[52:10.22]Anything spell related is gone.
[52:19.10]Holy shit, look at that ring though.
[52:21.36]Goodbye.
[52:29.16]Aren't you doing a magic build?
[52:30.29]This is a ranged build.
[52:31.72]I vetoed that, unfortunately.
[52:33.15]Sorry to say.
[52:37.80]Oh.
[52:44.92]Okay.
[52:45.81]What about just like, okay.
[52:46.83]What about just like cheese?
[52:47.80]Get a bunch of cheese.
[52:53.90]I think I can...
[52:55.70]I think I can do it, no?
[53:00.62]I'm gonna get these bars where they need to be and I'm going for it again.
[53:04.78]Okay, here we go.
[53:08.30]Shotgun is this, is it, I can reload the shotgun?
[53:12.73]Remember, I only hit three shots and two of them missed.
[53:20.27]I only have one acid jar left, but that's alright.
[53:22.62]All I care about is the shotgun.
[53:33.45]Also bring Horus.
[53:34.63]That's also true.
[53:43.33]Thank you.
[53:49.97]Anything in your inventory that would protect against curse rot?
[53:52.73]I don't think so.
[53:53.53]I know I have this.
[53:55.76]This is a heals curse damage.
[53:57.02]Maybe it's like an oh shit last ditch kind of effort.
[54:04.57]Okay, these apparently are insane.
[54:11.81]Fourteen of those, six of those, six of those.
[54:16.37]This is a bunch of health, this is a bunch of health, this is a bunch of health.
[54:22.17]Okay.
[54:24.64]I have a ton of heals.
[54:26.85]I've got enough damage, I've got enough... Yeah, alright, I'm ready.
[54:32.25]Oh fuck, I didn't want to do that.
[54:35.84]Alright, this time she's going down.
[54:39.61]It's happening... now.
[54:45.04]Let me make sure I'm doing this right as well.
[54:47.31]This blocks 100% curse damage.
[54:50.31]Okay, I have to have that on.
[54:53.71]What about this thing is crazy too though.
[54:58.25]The physical damage is ripping me apart when she does the dive.
[55:06.50]Maybe I should put on one of these ones.
[55:11.44]That thing's kind of great, right?
[55:14.57]I'll try this.
[55:17.72]Alright, let's fucking go.
[55:21.90]Anything that passively removes curse?
[55:23.49]I don't think I have anything that does.
[55:30.36]Heals 1 health point every 3 seconds Max Cursed Tolerance
[55:41.70]Melee?
[55:46.66]I don't think I do.
[55:50.88]I'm ready.
[55:52.07]She was at 30% health.
[55:53.07]Alright, Horace, let's go.
[55:56.34]You and me.
[55:56.76]Let's do it.
[55:58.37]I do need to heal, though.
[56:05.01]I think I'm gonna take this before aggroing and it'll be in the right spot and I'll just have the heal going.
[56:11.34]Okay, let's go.
[56:12.03]I'm ready.
[56:19.22]You're going to play Twilight Princess?
[56:20.52]If not, why would you not?
[56:23.19]Um, because Twilight Princess is Bloom the video game.
[56:39.87]Twilight Princess is opening your eyes underwater in a chlorine pool.
[56:54.67]Wait, my body's too weak to activate it?
[56:58.98]Oh, okay.
[57:07.88]Are we good now?
[57:12.91]Alright, here we go.
[57:15.38]Wait for this to tick all the way.
[57:21.40]I'm gonna eat that again when I'm not nourished.
[57:24.79]Alright, just go for it.
[57:25.76]I got the dog here.
[57:26.62]I'm ready.
[57:27.17]Here we go.
[57:27.51]Three.
[57:27.89]I lit it, right?
[57:28.58]Yep.
[57:29.24]I lit it, right?
[57:30.29]I forgot.
[57:30.63]Did I light it?
[57:31.41]It lit, right?
[57:43.46]Fuck off with the shield!
[57:54.95]I shot over her shoulder.
[57:58.47]Is Horace still here?
[58:08.57]You gotta be fucking kidding me, dude!
[58:32.17]Yes!
[58:36.15]No, don't be an idiot!
[58:54.45]Fuck that!
[59:37.18]No!
[59:40.47]Where's that cheese?
[60:08.31]Shield's broken.
[60:17.26]Oh, the... Ah!
[60:20.89]Oh, fuck off.
[60:23.31]Am I hitting her?
[60:25.34]I'm doing the angry voice, but what the hell?
[60:30.37]What the fuck, man?
[60:39.33]Use your shield, my shield's broken.
[60:56.00]Leelandagon!
[60:58.22]Why am I facing the other way?
[61:00.33]Oh my god, I'm gonna fucking scream.
[61:01.86]I'm dead right here.
[61:08.94]Oh my fucking god.
[61:10.51]This sucks asshole.
[61:13.89]I don't remember this fight being this much of a piece of shit.
[61:41.17]Don't have greed, no greed, no greed, no greed.
[61:44.41]You haven't done damage in five minutes?
[61:47.10]Shut up!
[61:52.84]Yeah, get the fuck out of here.
[61:55.75]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[62:01.69]What?
[62:09.00]That fight sucks.
[62:10.26]That's the shittiest fight.
[62:17.91]That was so horrible.
[62:26.48]Find a way around the first witch.
[62:30.50]It was probably the lag from the dice game.
[62:32.31]Oh, fuck.
[62:34.54]I forgot the dice game existed until you just said that.
[62:40.14]Thank you.
[62:46.18]Hold on a second!
[62:49.64]Wait, wait, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[62:52.25]Oh my god, that would have been a fucking disaster.
[62:59.82]Wow.
[63:02.41]That actually would have set me back to zero.
[63:04.95]I would have reset the whole thing.
[63:07.69]I...
[63:11.68]Oh, that would have been so bad.
[63:13.60]I would have been that I would end the stream.
[63:17.99]Oh my goodness gracious.
[63:19.48]OK, we can look at it again.
[63:27.27]Alright, I got 10 billion.
[63:28.65]10 billion.
[63:33.53]Let's get more diamond dice.
[63:38.57]dude I got look at that okay now what about the skill tree
[63:48.45]Oh.
[64:00.09]OK.
[64:06.90]I'm gonna get these old ones here.
[64:10.89]Yeah, dark matter.
[64:13.10]Dice speed.
[64:16.31]Income income.
[64:17.85]All these are going to be maxed out now.
[64:19.54]Time is going to be crazy.
[64:24.25]Look at this.
[64:26.70]Hell yeah, okay.
[64:28.47]50% multiplied by everything.
[64:31.10]Unlocks chance of 100% income.
[64:34.15]Even more of a chance.
[64:35.90]1% chance of rolling more dice and fucking crazy shit that it said?
[64:44.66]200% to general income of dice.
[64:48.37]Um, let's go.
[64:53.87]I'm already at a billion.
[64:59.42]Dude, look, I'm...
[65:07.32]Almost half a billion.
[65:12.72]I'll end here.
[65:13.44]This is where the stream will end.
[65:14.37]This is easy to do here.
[65:16.00]I can just hang out.
[65:17.95]It's saved anyways.
[65:21.44]I'm sorry.
[65:26.05]Thank you.
[65:36.60]It wasn't an hour.
[65:37.74]What do you mean it wasn't an hour?
[65:42.24]Didn't I play for like an hour and a half?
[65:50.22]Your Withering Rooms timer is paused at 59 minutes and 50 seconds.
[65:54.39]Are you kidding me?
[65:55.61]Okay, well... We got time.
[66:02.03]You mean I just have to go over to this other window and walk around for 10 seconds?
[66:08.50]I'll do that in a few minutes.
[66:10.75]That means that's such an easy thing to do.
[66:15.98]Oh.
[66:26.33]Fine.
[66:39.10]But she's pissed.
[66:39.85]She's like, we're waiting.
[66:45.14]It's so funny.
[66:45.83]I got mods in the mod chat saying, like, you should really just end it here.
[66:48.90]That'd be perfect.
[66:49.74]That'd be hilarious.
[66:51.04]And while I agree with you, that'd be actually amazing.
[66:54.80]Um, the believers never win ever.
[67:02.71]When was the last time Believers won on this channel?
[67:05.62]That's just... That's just sad, you know what I mean?
[67:08.11]Like, I can't...
[67:08.81]They gotta get a win.
[67:12.89]It'd be so funny, but I can't fuck over the believers.
[67:15.95]I can't do that.
[67:25.36]Oh, organ chamber.
[67:33.88]We are getting close to the end of the game though.
[67:39.93]The next time I stream this,
[67:43.06]This is a cool part.
[67:43.68]Look at this.
[67:48.02]It reminds me of the, uh, in Ghostbusters 2.
[67:56.63]That's crazy.
[67:57.10]Is there a mirror here?
[68:05.33]I've got to get a mirror before I stop.
[68:19.09]I'm playing around right now.
[68:20.44]I need a mirror.
[68:25.32]It's an elevator.
[68:31.88]21 mil...
[68:41.90]Holy fucking moly.
[68:43.96]Goodbye.
[68:44.95]We'll do this when I get- We'll do this another day.
[69:01.71]Alright, we're going to check in one more time with the dice game.
[69:11.32]This place is burning.
[69:12.11]That boss was fucked.
[69:24.41]Yeah, there's only one more stream of this, 100%.
[69:27.55]There's probably maybe two or three hours left in the game total, maybe?
[69:30.00]Maybe even less.
[69:31.03]I don't remember if there's a little bit more after this.
[69:36.70]I think you have to explore that big blood tower and I think that's it.
[69:42.48]There's also all the side stuff too that we could try to do.
[69:58.72]I'm 100% convinced of the sleepy, savory dog smell.
[70:01.81]No one believes me.
[70:02.53]That's... People don't get it.
[70:06.04]Once you know, you absolutely know.
[70:14.93]I've had people come up to me in person and be like, dude, I, I did not believe you.
[70:19.77]I didn't know what you were talking about.
[70:20.80]And then it hit me one day, my dog rolled over.
[70:26.68]and was like really tired and really hot.
[70:30.41]And all of a sudden the house just filled with that savory like dog soup.
[70:35.79]I was like, yeah, I know.
[70:39.34]Okay.
[70:40.50]That's it for Withering Rooms.
[70:41.75]We will check this back out, maybe even tomorrow.
[70:44.62]We've got a sponsor with Ster tomorrow.
[70:48.79]And just for a little bit, let's check this out.
[70:58.56]Let's just check it out for a few minutes.
[71:05.87]Just to see what happened here.
[71:07.10]Okay, 2.8 billion.
[71:16.60]Alright, let's get here's what I want to do.
[71:18.96]I want to get the diamond income up one or two more times and I'm done.
[71:37.47]I mean, I think this is the whole, this is the whole tree.
[71:42.43]Looks like something can go here though.
[71:44.08]Am I crazy?
[71:47.36]No, they cannot definitely.
[72:00.59]I will see you later, though.
[72:02.34]Have a good night.
[72:03.37]Thanks for watching.
[72:07.14]See you tomorrow.
[72:08.88]Probably starting...
[72:10.41]The sponsor is at 1 Pacific.
[72:12.50]So we're either going to start with something else earlier or start with the sponsor and go to something else.
[72:19.62]It is Where Winds Meet.
[72:21.89]I haven't seen too much of the game.
[72:23.52]I have seen that people thought it was fun and funny and interesting and weird.
[72:28.04]and it was a cool game so I want to try it and it's a sponsor and that's pretty sick
[72:42.03]Alright, see you tomorrow.
[72:43.84]Tata, goodbye.
[72:49.06]I think this automatically saves, right?
[72:50.34]Yeah, save and quit.
[72:58.00]Have a good evening.
[72:59.31]Oh, you can't hear the music.
[73:01.86]Now you can.
[73:08.73]See you tomorrow.
[73:11.31]I am hungry.
[73:12.98]What's for dinner?
