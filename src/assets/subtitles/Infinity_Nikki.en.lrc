[ve:61.1.100]

[00:09.58]Okay, I'm here.
[00:10.90]Alright.
[00:12.64]So this is it.
[00:15.28]This is it.
[00:17.41]I think?
[00:23.15]I think this is it.
[00:23.69]Oh, you can't see it?
[00:24.57]What the heck?
[00:31.19]Now you can see it.
[00:35.51]Is it loud?
[00:42.46]This looks like Elden Ring.
[00:45.88]I feel like I'm in Limgrave right now.
[00:47.60]I think it's the same stuff.
[00:49.90]It looks like the same banister.
[00:59.95]OK.
[01:01.45]It's dress up souls.
[01:03.29]Is it really?
[01:03.87]How's the audio?
[01:07.13]We good?
[01:08.23]I skipped the opening cutscene.
[01:09.75]I don't know what's going on.
[01:10.71]All I know is that I'm this girl.
[01:16.63]And you can do that.
[01:19.59]So I get points for how, like, pretty my dress is?
[01:22.35]Okay.
[01:26.07]Follow the mystery.
[01:26.91]I'm literally in the tutorial.
[01:28.05]I just skipped it.
[01:28.76]Everything I skipped.
[01:29.34]If you're wondering what the thing in the bottom left is, that's like my player ID.
[01:33.54]And I don't want you all to be fucking spamming the shit out of me.
[01:36.70]Because I think that's my actual, like, account ID on Infinity Nikki.
[01:40.72]Alright, let's go.
[01:49.40]There's a dash.
[01:50.74]It doesn't do anything that this does nothing.
[01:52.70]Can you like?
[02:07.95]Can you fall off and die?
[02:13.33]I bet you can.
[02:17.01]Uh, jump.
[02:30.56]You can fall from here.
[02:34.86]That's not that far.
[02:36.06]You could make that joke very easily.
[02:38.03]Oh, never mind.
[02:39.07]No, you can't.
[02:39.45]Okay.
[02:39.55]Yeah, so the blue is... It lets you float...
[02:58.65]Okay, hold down and then press it again.
[03:01.13]I almost just screwed it up.
[03:05.92]Is it combat?
[03:13.90]This is kind of a far way to go.
[03:15.20]Oh my god.
[03:22.30]You can jump higher?
[03:23.20]What?
[03:27.20]Okay.
[03:37.51]Okay.
[03:39.27]What is this indicator here?
[03:42.23]Like how far I'm going to jump?
[03:50.02]Okay.
[03:51.10]Watch for overhead obstacles and leave space for... Okay.
[03:55.18]You want to really...
[04:03.68]Wow.
[04:10.14]Oh, no, somebody's trapped.
[04:11.08]We've got to save them.
[04:16.28]That is an Essling spawned from dark essence.
[04:19.58]An Essling?
[04:20.24]Awaken the whim inside the green dress and use this purification outfit to banish it.
[04:27.21]Okay.
[04:33.90]That was pretty instant.
[04:37.91]Bro, you're 40.
[04:39.11]I'm... We saw this game pop up at the fucking E3 showcase.
[04:42.47]Whatever it was.
[04:43.53]The game awards.
[04:47.49]And Stuart's like... We were like, oh, is this game any good?
[04:49.63]Stuart's like, oh, why don't you play it next stream?
[04:51.40]And I'm like, okay.
[04:55.08]And the game looks pretty fucking fun.
[04:56.84]Okay.
[04:57.52]Look at this.
[05:00.34]Look.
[05:00.44]Look.
[05:02.41]Collect coins?
[05:13.45]It's called bling.
[05:17.11]Everything from styling to adventuring.
[05:22.11]Okay.
[05:27.46]Seems like things auto attack.
[05:33.32]Oh.
[05:37.17]See the shadow.
[05:40.67]Mm-hmm.
[05:43.17]We'll go to this cathedral or whatever this is.
[05:49.66]Charge.
[05:51.70]I don't think you're making it to the ballroom.
[05:54.72]Maybe this is even better.
[05:56.44]Wait, secrets.
[05:57.02]This place is way more fun.
[05:59.13]Told you.
[05:59.45]Although, you really don't know what's waiting for us.
[06:02.74]There's going to be a ton of secrets, right?
[06:03.80]There's a secret down here.
[06:15.51]There's no such thing as fall damage.
[06:16.85]There's only phase out and die.
[06:19.29]Okay.
[06:20.41]Okay.
[06:22.55]So water kills you and air also kills you.
[06:32.01]It's going to be treasured.
[06:32.81]When do I get my when do I get my I have like three dresses already when I see my first dress woven into the threads of reunion.
[06:48.26]This will open the temple gate.
[06:51.12]OK.
[06:58.24]Engage.
[07:08.51]That is a... Look at that glove.
[07:12.37]What a glove that is.
[07:22.26]Would you guys be upset if I started wearing gemmed gloves?
[07:25.68]Since the Heavenfall, I, Ina the Curator, have been imprisoned here for a thousand years.
[07:39.90]Oh shit, it actually is.
[07:41.23]She just shattered the Elden Ring.
[07:42.41]The suit, Peter.
[08:08.12]I used to dance with its owner.
[08:11.46]Things are getting kind of creepy.
[08:13.50]Those were the good days.
[08:21.43]Oh no, she's gonna pull that gem out.
[08:22.83]She's gonna be an old hag.
[08:41.32]Don't worry, Nikki.
[08:42.82]They're all bots.
[08:43.86]You're gonna be just fine.
[08:46.86]Not even an old hag, that's right.
[09:13.75]I was wearing a miracle outfit the other day.
[09:26.32]I lost the elastic band inside of my pants.
[09:30.28]It was a fucking miracle those things were staying up around my waist.
[09:32.88]Thank you.
[09:33.87]I'll be here all week.
[09:42.59]The game looks great.
[09:50.76]It looks very good.
[09:52.08]The graphics are great.
[09:54.18]It's presented very well.
[09:55.60]I think I was dreaming.
[09:59.16]Not a dream.
[10:01.22]We were really sent to the middle of nowhere.
[10:05.54]Miraland?
[10:10.12]Imagine if Otto could talk and you could go on an adventure like this with him.
[10:16.18]All he'd want to do is go to Burger King.
[10:22.10]We wouldn't go on any adventures.
[10:23.39]We'd go to Burger King every time.
[10:25.47]Hey Jeremy, let's go on an adventure too.
[10:29.21]Let's go to Burger King.
[10:31.12]Okay, let's go to Burger King, Otto.
[10:33.20]Yeah.
[10:33.46]That should be fine.
[10:34.26]Sure you want to go to Burger King again?
[10:36.48]Yes.
[10:36.70]Okay, it's the only place we've been.
[10:40.53]Okay.
[10:57.49]The goddess with the eye patch.
[11:00.57]She must have sent us for a reason.
[11:01.97]That was not really an eye patch as much as it was a accessory over the eye.
[11:08.91]You're right.
[11:09.69]Let's get out of here and look around.
[11:13.13]Yeah, it was an eye crown.
[11:14.49]That's a good way to put it.
[11:15.65]Here you go, Nikki.
[11:17.27]Your backpack.
[11:18.73]Alright.
[11:20.29]Strap it on and let's get going.
[11:26.42]Alright, then when do I get my sword?
[11:28.20]My huge, like, ten foot long sword.
[11:31.17]Okay, a backpack so surprisingly spacious that it can hold all your dreams and more.
[11:38.01]Aww.
[11:38.57]Alright.
[11:43.22]Embark on an unknown journey.
[11:45.66]Leave the unfamiliar ruins.
[11:48.76]Open your wardrobe.
[11:55.11]Clothing and accessories are displayed by category.
[11:57.37]Select accessories.
[12:01.44]Select back pieces.
[12:02.94]Put on the backpack.
[12:06.52]Oh.
[12:07.82]It's a nice little accessory piece.
[12:13.15]Oh, well, let me do anything else.
[12:14.17]Okay.
[12:17.45]Wait, what about... You got nothing.
[12:21.44]Okay.
[12:21.62]Okay.
[12:25.38]View ongoing quest there, right?
[12:27.28]We just have like an indicator.
[12:28.16]Alright, let's go.
[12:28.84]Something feels tight in my chest.
[12:32.87]Is it the heart of infinity?
[12:34.57]I know it's a divine blessing.
[12:38.83]My body seems to be rejecting it.
[12:41.37]I don't have a, I can't jump anymore.
[12:46.95]I lost the jump dress and I don't think I'm kidding.
[12:50.36]Huh?
[12:53.38]We're stuck.
[12:57.67]You know what would be really great?
[12:59.81]If we had the floating outfit to help us get over this.
[13:02.73]True.
[13:03.35]Unfortunately, we don't have it anymore.
[13:07.08]Let's take a look around.
[13:08.64]Maybe there's another way.
[13:10.06]No, I have to actually... I can't just jump over things.
[13:12.12]Alright.
[13:13.08]Anything up?
[13:18.56]No.
[13:21.93]Secret.
[13:22.73]What a beautiful star.
[13:25.19]What is it?
[13:27.70]The cat already has haters.
[13:29.17]Wait, this cat?
[13:32.76]Oh, I don't know.
[13:33.26]Is he annoying?
[13:52.66]Wait, wait.
[13:54.39]It's going to activate the thing and then I'm going to be able to... Yep, it's going to be a new outfit.
[14:06.96]You've got a Whim Star.
[14:08.20]Now I'm opening a... Activate the Heart of Infinity Shard, Wishfield, and infuse it with the power of Whim.
[14:21.82]Inspirations from your journey are sealed as nodes in the heart of infinity.
[14:24.90]Is it going to be like a path of exile tree?
[14:30.10]Okay.
[14:33.21]Well, this is the floating outfit.
[14:42.14]Briefly float after a jump.
[14:45.16]Oh, do you just get it all?
[14:50.23]Can you change outfits?
[14:51.75]Can I like... Oh, I think these... Wait, no.
[14:54.35]These are sketches.
[14:56.79]Sketch.
[14:58.01]Sketch.
[15:00.10]Okay, I don't even know if... Can I put it on?
[15:01.78]I have to be the best dressed Infinity Nikki streamer.
[15:07.86]I'm fine.
[15:14.31]It's called a Wimstar.
[15:16.49]It's the embodiment of whimsicality and inspiration.
[15:22.61]When it fused with the Heart of Infinity, I felt an indescribable power.
[15:29.00]It was mysterious and deep.
[15:33.12]I suppose maybe whimsters are the power source for the heart of infinity.
[15:38.12]Then we should focus on collecting more of them along the way.
[15:40.04]I'm getting a little jealous I didn't get to have a whimsical, deep, meaningful, wonderful journey like you did.
[15:45.25]I acquired the floating outfit sketch.
[15:49.79]Really?
[15:50.11]That awesome blue one?
[15:52.53]Right.
[15:53.79]That one makes me as light as a bubble.
[15:56.27]I can float through the air with ease.
[15:59.07]Whoa, that's great, Nikki.
[16:00.91]Hurry up and make it.
[16:03.79]Okay.
[16:06.23]Craft the bubbly voyage outfit.
[16:08.49]Okay, why is sketches?
[16:13.87]View all acquired sketches here.
[16:15.56]Do I have to craft it?
[16:20.34]You can view all the pieces of the outfit and craft them.
[16:25.26]Okay.
[16:27.17]It's eight apples and 163 strings.
[16:32.81]This is a whimsical dream, isn't it?
[16:35.75]Okay.
[16:37.15]Uh... Okay.
[16:39.43]So I ate apples.
[16:41.07]Apples seem like the kind of currency for making clothes.
[16:44.03]Looks like there's a lot of this.
[16:45.65]Why is it sweet?
[16:46.46]Is there a sour?
[16:49.20]Or...
[17:02.85]How's that work?
[17:10.53]Wait.
[17:11.99]Is that rarity?

[19:12.78]The vines around it are gone.
[19:16.03]We better be careful.

[21:02.43]Is this sponsored or not?
[21:03.57]No, it's not.
[21:05.43]It's not sponsored.
[21:06.21]I just want to play it.
[21:09.70]Okay.
[21:10.08]I acquired the sketch for the Wind of Purity outfit.
[21:23.12]This dude's addicted.
[21:23.90]I'm not even out of the tutorial yet.
[21:26.28]We need to find materials.
[21:29.85]Okay.
[21:31.29]So we need three peaches, two pieces of sap, and two dandelions.
[21:36.87]You got it.
[21:37.23]Let's get them.
[21:51.65]Got one.
[22:03.11]It's so funny when people come in and say like, oh, man, like, oh, dude, playing Marvel Rivals.
[22:08.53]Bro, you fucking stink.
[22:11.49]Dude, this dude stinks at this game.
[22:13.60]Hey, maybe do something more your speed, Jerma.

[22:26.81]You told me to play something my own speed.
[22:28.73]So I am.
[22:38.03]Alright, let's make it.
[22:48.07]The quest is this thing.
[22:51.43]Already got it.

[22:53.59]All materials collected.
[22:54.35]Check it out.
[23:01.26]Okay.
[23:05.92]What do I do?
[23:08.56]How do I do this?
[23:12.82]Oh, it's the sketches.
[23:13.75]Right, right, right.
[23:17.41]I think I just do it all.
[23:25.30]So this is an opportunity to be... Or are we just seeing the absolute best possible version of this because of the tutorial?
[23:31.20]This is not going to be like a one star, right?
[23:46.55]best possible because tutorial, okay.
[23:54.65]There's three five star outfits.
[23:59.16]Oh my goodness.
[24:01.32]Okay, I got it.
[24:03.50]Now I should be able to... I think I just killed in the cutscene.
[24:17.16]Hey, nice outfit.
[24:17.80]Thanks.
[24:24.65]When he actually gets to see the surprise-o-matic, it's actually over.
[24:34.42]Oh, that thing.
[24:35.66]Scam-o-matic.
[24:38.04]I don't... Okay.
[24:39.62]Okay.
[24:56.67]Uh, what does it want me to do?
[25:03.46]Every 10 resonances guarantees a four star or higher piece.
[25:11.82]Oh, look at these are the five star outfits.
[25:17.88]So the first one's free is what I'm understanding here.
[25:24.91]Choose title guidance to obtain your desired outfit more quickly.
[25:28.49]Uh... What do I want?
[25:41.00]Okay, this is very elegant.
[25:46.10]Oh wait, it actually has a rating for elegant, fresh, sweet, cool, and sexy are the different categories.
[25:54.29]Okay.
[25:54.69]What about this one?
[25:58.45]Okay.
[25:59.39]This one is a little more practical.
[26:03.02]Bug catching.
[26:03.74]I think I might have to get the bug one.
[26:11.22]This one is very fresh.
[26:12.62]This one is very not sexy and very not elegant and very not sweet.
[26:20.99]Okay.
[26:32.99]Tea time?
[26:37.57]Which one of these do I want to go for?
[26:39.29]Is it just up to me?
[26:40.05]Whoa, you can change it.
[26:48.86]You can make it winter themed?
[26:52.82]Oh, man.
[26:59.36]I'm going to have to go with the bug one, I think.
[27:04.06]I just want the net.
[27:10.51]Grants the use of a net to catch various bugs and insects.
[27:18.89]Okay, so I'm going to select this one.
[27:22.43]Oh, I can't select it.
[27:26.40]Oh.
[27:28.94]So which one of these default ones do I want?
[27:33.97]Alright.
[27:34.33]If I was to actually pick it, it would be either this one or this one.
[27:47.41]I think these two.
[27:48.73]I like the red and I like the green.
[27:51.85]Blue is cool.
[27:52.83]Blue is great.
[27:53.55]I love blue.
[27:54.07]Blue is one of my favorite colors.
[27:57.23]But, meh.
[28:02.86]You can change the color though.
[28:04.22]Actually, I kind of like this design better than... Can I do it?
[28:12.15]I'm getting this one.
[28:12.95]I like this design more than this one, but I like this color more.
[28:17.74]Am I actually talking about this?
[28:20.52]I'm sitting here talking about this.
[28:22.16]I'm very excited about it.
[28:32.62]Did I get it?
[28:33.09]It says I can give up.
[28:36.99]I don't want to give up.
[28:38.45]Oh.
[28:38.51]Alright, here we go.

[30:29.90]I think these work.
[30:31.92]These work.
[30:36.01]Take a look at that.
[30:44.33]Does this work?
[30:48.44]I think it works.
[30:56.00]Twinkling hair accessory.
[30:57.86]Okay.
[31:04.11]I put the crown on.
[31:08.23]Bro, change the socks.
[31:09.61]Why?
[31:09.97]What's wrong with them?
[31:13.53]Am I getting critiqued?
[31:15.01]I'm going to get my ass kicked in Overwatch, and I'm going to get my ass kicked in fucking Marvel Rivals.
[31:19.41]I'm going to get my ass kicked in TF2.
[31:20.57]I'm going to get my ass kicked in Valorant.
[31:23.24]I'm going to get my ass kicked in picking an outfit, too.
[31:27.08]Apparently.
[31:36.93]Look at that.
[31:37.63]This is cute.
[31:42.01]Oh, no.
[31:42.29]I lose the earrings.
[31:45.83]Should I put the cuffs on too?
[31:47.05]Okay, we're going to do the cuffs.
[31:51.25]I'm going to wear the bow tie.
[31:52.41]And then I'm going to... Yeah.
[31:57.64]Yep.
[31:58.76]Jeweled gemmed gloves.
[32:06.82]Take these off.
[32:08.08]No, it's a cool look.
[32:12.71]You don't think that's like cool?
[32:14.27]I think this is like a cool look.
[32:16.51]Oh, actually, wait, maybe not.
[32:21.37]Do the black shoes.
[32:25.28]Hey, you can do whatever you want in your game, okay?
[32:35.18]I like the white.
[32:35.72]Alright, I think that's good.
[32:45.88]Bro, what happened?
[32:50.67]What just happened?
[32:51.71]I didn't save it?
[32:55.69]Oh, fuck.
[32:57.53]Really?
[32:58.99]I... Oh.
[33:01.03]Well, I know everything.
[33:02.05]I think I remember everything.
[33:06.21]Actually, good thing I did that because I wanted to see the different hair.
[33:24.17]I think that's it, right?
[33:25.27]Yep.
[33:25.73]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[33:27.04]There we go.
[33:28.12]And then there's this.
[33:30.42]And... A lot of stuff.
[33:36.02]Okay.
[33:36.32]Alright, I want to see the hair.
[33:48.39]Get a closer look.
[33:49.41]I like that.
[33:49.93]Hmm.
[33:52.57]Hmm.
[33:59.07]I think that's, I think, yeah, another way it was before.
[34:08.22]Make sure you're either wearing a dress or both a top and a bottom before going out.
[34:13.30]Do I not have a top?
[34:14.08]Wait, what do you mean?
[34:19.44]Oh, I don't have one.
[34:22.25]Oh, okay.
[34:26.43]Oh, shit.
[34:32.24]There we go.
[34:32.74]That just fucking hurt my head and scared the shit out of me at the same time.
[34:37.92]Okay, the fact that you can put on your own clothes.
[34:45.44]There's probably gonna be so many different items.
[35:11.91]Wait, there are other people?
[35:15.17]Huh?
[35:15.89]Where are the S-Lings?
[35:18.33]We just purified them all.
[35:21.22]Really?
[35:22.68]Wow, that's awesome.
[35:26.38]Silly me.
[35:27.30]I'm Dada, head of the Flora Wish Stylist Guild.
[35:29.88]For any Wishfield Stylist questions, I'm your girl.
[35:33.16]I'm Nikki, and this is Momo, my best friend.
[35:35.87]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[35:37.31]I'm Nikki's BSS.
[35:41.90]I want those glasses that's for sure.
[35:44.06]I definitely have to try to make myself look as stupid as possible and try to win a competition.
[36:05.93]You have to fight her to steal her look.
[36:07.35]Are you serious?
[36:23.96]Something tells me that this is one of those games that is... We're not even scratching the surface of what is in the game.
[36:33.19]It's probably 5,000 hours of content.
[36:35.97]There's probably 10,000 fucking items to put on.
[36:51.64]Okay.
[36:51.78]I think we're done with the tutorial.
[36:54.28]We're getting close to it.
[37:26.76]Will you please play this again?
[37:28.08]Will you play this again?
[37:28.70]I don't know.
[37:31.70]Ooh.
[37:40.20]Wow.
[37:40.42]It's my own little oasis.
[37:59.86]Ooh!
[38:03.44]Hold on.
[38:10.37]Wait, it doesn't count?
[38:11.51]I think I have to craft it.
[38:12.75]Is it technically a sketch?
[38:17.61]Ah, shit, it is.
[38:19.23]What does this take?
[38:19.99]Five apples, two flowers.
[38:22.39]It's pretty fresh.
[38:31.34]I have to make this.
[38:37.92]Go pull more gacha.
[38:41.47]I didn't load up a bunch of money to fucking buy a bunch of coins.
[38:46.83]I'm doing the tutorial.
[38:48.37]Checkpoint.
[39:02.13]You have 999.
[39:02.61]Wait, what?
[39:03.77]That's cool.
[39:17.37]Open the map.
[39:21.43]Oh, cool.
[39:25.33]Oh shit.
[39:26.31]They actually tell you how many are there.
[39:32.12]I'm going to get obsessed with this.
[39:38.40]There's one right there.
[39:38.94]So you're saying I can go right now and I can just go pull a bunch of... That's what we call reaction time.
[40:11.85]Should I just get them all?
[40:19.14]Somebody said, why am I playing this Barbie game?
[40:23.42]I can't wait.
[40:25.27]I can't.
[40:25.63]You know what?
[40:26.13]It's going to be good.
[40:26.71]I can't wait for like 30, 40 more minutes to go by and all the people that are saying Barbie game, Barbie game are all so invested in the first boss fight where I have to like fucking slay and beat the other person's outfit.
[40:42.86]I would like, I want to see your chat message in about 40 minutes.
[40:56.11]Okay.
[40:56.49]So you get treasures.
[40:58.85]You can be given to Cadenceborns in exchange for Cadenceborn treasure.
[41:04.62]Pick up everything.
[41:14.45]What does this say?
[41:29.32]Where are the pre-stream, pre-stream chatters that were BatChest fear mongering?
[41:33.56]I mean, it's, it's a, it's a different kind of game, right?
[41:44.34]It's, I don't know if we're going to be like fucking decapitating anybody, but, uh, I don't know.
[41:52.20]We'll give it a little chance.
[41:53.05]It seems like it could be, it seems cute.
[42:01.35]It's a game where you just like style clothes.
[42:03.69]You know how many people have been waiting for games like this?
[42:08.52]I like games where I like punch guys in the face.
[42:12.54]And where I like get on a sled and like slide down and go fast.
[42:17.76]How come they don't make sledding games?
[42:44.52]Alright, tutorial done.
[42:46.26]This is very pretty.
[42:50.82]There's a wind star around here somewhere.
[43:01.24]This is beautiful.
[43:02.96]It's beautiful.
[43:04.08]Don't act like you didn't see this and just go, man, that's really nice looking.
[43:07.49]Wow, this is like a beautiful painting.
[43:08.83]Can you talk to people?
[43:26.72]These are some beautiful hydrangeas.
[43:37.27]R1, R1, R1, R1.
[43:38.99]Maybe the world could go on without gods.
[43:50.29]Not without wishes.
[43:51.33]That's when the flatline happens.
[43:59.93]That was really... I'm sorry about making a fucking non... That was not funny.
[44:12.76]This person has a name.
[44:13.65]Who are you?
[44:14.13]Do you have any wishes that haven't come true yet?
[44:22.09]I've hung a wish bottle on the highest branch of the Great Wish Tree, but still.
[44:28.04]No, no.
[44:28.54]As a future top botanist in Mirrorland, I won't be discouraged by minor setbacks.
[44:34.02]I'll find a way.
[44:34.90]You'll see.
[44:41.88]Why are they British?
[44:42.58]I don't know.
[44:48.04]I don't know why.
[44:50.99]Guys, I'm sorry.
[44:51.89]Anybody, any child in anything that has a hat like this and wears a striped shirt, you're British.
[45:01.56]It's not even a striped shirt.
[45:02.36]It looked like it, though.
[45:04.99]All little kids are British in every media to me.
[45:08.25]I don't know why.
[45:08.73]I just imagine they're going to run and be like, oh, get off her, mate.
[45:14.61]Okay.
[45:15.09]There's a place where you can find... What can I find?
[45:27.13]Where can I get button cones?
[45:29.91]Go behind the... Boutique, let's go.
[45:32.63]Boutique?
[45:34.57]That's miles away.
[45:35.54]What, it's just across the square.
[45:37.30]Thanks for the intel.
[45:48.52]Nice house.
[45:54.20]The red top is too flashy with those green pants.
[45:56.92]Don't you think you look like a lamp chili with legs?
[46:03.85]Isn't that much better?
[46:04.77]There must be a reason for the lamp chili's red and green combinations.
[46:09.03]Stop talking.
[46:09.57]Let's look at the next one.
[46:18.38]Okay, I'm getting overwhelmed by everybody.
[46:22.84]Are we good?
[46:28.90]What the hell just happened?
[46:35.70]Remember, your daily reset just happened.
[46:37.74]Alright, I'm just going to do the quest because there's so much shit here.
[46:58.37]Regarding this year's special event prizes from every stylist's guild, the applications and approval process are... Clause 1, Clause 2.
[47:09.31]There are 36 clauses?
[47:17.58]I just came in here and stunned everybody.
[47:22.40]Everybody froze.
[47:23.74]Everybody was just looking like, whoa.
[47:25.32]That dress.
[47:29.43]no personal info okay uh

[48:04.15]Okay.
[48:06.69]Okay.
[48:07.65]That's good to know.
[48:08.49]Good to know.
[48:10.57]Player 480.
[48:12.01]We're not going to use that over here, are we?
[48:22.52]Player 480.
[48:25.92]no that sucks how about something very very just normal something that's stylish something that is um cool and I just almost choked it's cool and I don't know like a cucumber cucumber

[49:06.12]Uh, how about... This is just... These are the taglines of the dresses.
[49:33.56]How about like, I don't know, like mojito or something?
[49:39.57]How about like fresh mojito?
[49:43.85]Fresh mojito.
[49:48.35]I spelt it wrong.
[49:48.99]It's fine.
[49:55.86]I can't even click on it anymore.
[50:02.20]Fresh mojito.
[50:08.53]Every time I'm at a bar, I don't ask the guy, how do you spell that?
[50:11.41]Uh, can I get a mojito, please?
[50:14.67]Yeah, sure.
[50:15.11]Spell it first.
[50:17.37]Uh, shove it up your ass.
[50:18.93]No, that's never going to happen.
[50:24.47]There you go.
[50:25.01]Fresh mojito.
[50:25.67]Alright, I'm going to do this because apparently you guys can see my fucking ID.
[50:33.58]Fresh blunt.
[50:36.87]Oh, it does show my fucking thing right there.
[50:39.15]Yeah, you guys have just fucking been spamming me.
[50:43.63]Did I hide it?
[50:48.05]Oh, that's definitely the number in the lower left as well.
[50:50.31]I'm glad I'm hiding it.
[50:51.63]I feel like it matters.
[50:54.04]It doesn't matter.
[50:54.76]Alright, here you go.
[51:07.92]Click on the mail button on your PeerPal and claim all.
[51:11.41]I guess I'm a rookie stylist.

[51:29.82]Okay.

[52:30.49]Now you're all set.
[52:32.69]it matters anymore anyways okay alright how was the rest of your trip come across anything weird what would
[53:00.32]We saw small blue creatures flying around in little cloaks.
[53:04.36]So cute.
[53:07.82]It's fine, bro.
[53:08.64]You're only going to play this game once anyways.
[53:12.78]I mean, you say that, but this is like a relaxing fun game.
[53:16.62]I think that could... This could be a hit the bong and then sit down and play Infinity Nikki for an hour.
[53:24.36]You know what I'm saying?
[53:28.74]How romantic.
[53:34.05]I'm so, like, giggly today, too.
[53:35.41]I don't know what's wrong with me.
[53:36.81]Mm-hmm.
[53:58.57]Your princess coded.
[54:25.30]I can't take code from all kinds of different code.
[54:27.44]Yeah, I make a really mean fresh homemade pizza.
[54:30.85]Am I pizza coded?
[54:31.55]What are you on about?
[54:32.25]You're chef coded at that point.
[55:01.61]What kind of weed utensils do you have?
[55:03.23]Grow up.
[55:16.90]Compendium?
[55:20.52]It's the outfit compendium that I helped create, along with Bebe and Kilo the Cadenceborn.
[55:25.78]It lists all the outfits we found
[55:28.55]Oh, does it have every single piece of clothing?
[55:31.56]I actually want to look at this.
[55:33.08]This is the compendium.
[55:36.74]Updating the compendium will improve your rating.
[55:39.12]And the stylist guild will reward you for your efforts.
[55:42.78]This is the outfit compendium.
[55:45.47]There's so many menus.
[55:47.11]Okay.
[55:47.21]Tribute to Radiant.
[55:47.93]Here's an example of a theme.
[55:59.94]In progress.
[56:10.15]Okay.
[56:11.01]I guess there's... I think you just have to do it.
[56:21.03]In progress?
[56:21.80]What do you mean not owned?
[56:23.98]How do I get them?
[56:36.46]You have to gamble for it?
[56:37.76]Do I actually have currency?
[56:38.84]Do I have 10 free bowls or something?
[56:44.47]Find sketches, craft.
[56:45.37]Find sketches, craft.
[56:46.03]You're gonna have to get the credit card out for this next one?
[56:48.67]Uh...
[57:00.92]I don't know about that.
[57:02.46]Check your mail.
[57:02.94]Wishing, wishing.
[57:03.78]Whimsy items, whimsical wishes.
[57:28.86]Stylists sell wishing items?
[57:33.59]Materials don't just fall from the sky, so we need to make a living.
[57:37.37]Giovanni sells wish flight paper during the day.
[57:40.41]It's a type of whim tech.
[57:41.67]Whim tech?
[57:42.07]You can usually find them at Great Wish Tree Square.
[57:48.69]Whim is what grants wings to our wishes.
[57:54.91]Anyway, you have to try it.
[57:59.54]Do you know a good real life stylist?
[58:04.05]I kind of just go get my haircut whenever.
[58:07.59]Whenever I feel like it gets too long, I just go to like a barber or like a salon and just say, hey.
[58:12.97]I always open up with the same thing too.
[58:16.36]I say, it's been a long time.
[58:20.18]It's been quite a while.
[58:21.30]It's been quite a while because it always is.
[58:22.96]It's always six months at least.
[58:26.85]But I try to make it sound like I get my hair cut a lot.
[58:31.47]So I just kind of... You do like a half lie where you just go, oh, you know, it's been a little while.
[58:39.23]Usually that means a month or two.
[58:40.67]Usually it means like a few months, not like three years.
[58:46.49]You've added a new friend.
[58:47.51]No, I didn't.
[58:47.93]What?
[58:51.19]Oh, wait.
[58:52.21]Should I?
[58:52.79]I don't want this.
[58:53.39]I don't want any friends.
[58:56.80]Oh, it's in-game, friends.
[59:02.34]You can... Wait, I can type?
[59:09.36]Oh, okay.
[59:10.28]Actually, I get it.
[59:12.74]We can chat now.
[59:13.74]Still got two stacks of documents to finish.
[59:19.51]Don't forget to explore Flora Wish while you're here.
[59:23.51]Okay.
[59:25.41]Oh, we didn't get the...
[59:37.21]I'm not doing it.
[59:38.55]I'm not doing it.
[59:39.49]I don't wanna click this.
[59:42.11]I don't wanna do it.
[60:18.43]I think I actually have to generate a code.
[60:20.57]I think that's how that works.
[60:27.68]Okay.
[60:29.64]So now it feels like the game has completely opened.
[60:35.72]I kind of just have to go to the Great Wish Tree during the day to buy some items.
[60:43.47]Is there emotes?
[60:44.17]Can I wave to people or something?
[60:46.99]Can I dance?
[60:47.93]Is there a dance emote?
[61:04.08]Twist it left, wrap it right.
[61:06.53]If we make more strings, we can have no way out.
[61:13.41]Right, Ruby.
[61:14.15]Are these the ones that are singing?
[61:29.12]Pick up everything.
[61:35.34]I'm going to get up because I want to see from above.
[61:38.28]I'm looking for the stars.
[61:52.44]What is that weird vision thing?
[61:56.66]Here it is.
[61:58.94]That one is far away.
[62:10.53]Go to the dive bar.
[62:11.55]Let me get this first.
[62:16.60]A cat?
[62:19.12]No.
[62:19.54]Here we go.
[62:36.16]Anymore?
[62:37.62]There is another one over there.
[62:39.24]Ooh, that's high up.
[62:39.95]How do I get that one?
[62:54.66]What is this about?
[62:55.62]These star currencies.
[62:57.62]This bling?
[62:59.72]What do I do with that?
[63:00.38]I know what I do with the, what, resonance?
[63:15.06]I think that's all of them here.
[63:21.00]You give me a goofy thing to have to just go get.
[63:30.03]Within the yellow circle.
[63:32.87]Investigate the star-shaped item to activate and obtain it.
[63:40.73]Inside the circle.
[63:46.41]That's cute.
[63:59.27]I have every single thing I think on ultra.
[64:01.67]So if you think it's a little frame ratey, it's a little bit, it's like 40, 50, 60 frames a second, but I do have every single thing as high as it can go.
[64:16.14]Okay.
[64:17.04]Go buy some stuff.
[64:18.21]Giovanni.
[64:20.53]Okay.
[64:36.82]Thus, the barren land saw the birth of Orosa.
[64:41.16]These... Everyone loves this guy.
[64:43.05]Paper cranes carried the smallest of wishes.
[64:58.61]Uh oh.
[64:58.87]He even did the thing where the arm comes across the chest and the thumb is a bow.
[65:24.03]Someone's pissing in the corner over there on the left.
[65:30.92]Didn't think we were a party.
[65:34.04]Beasts!
[65:34.20]Okay.
[65:56.79]Your intuition is correct.
[65:59.35]Wishfield's story isn't just about one glorious moment.
[66:04.65]It includes long periods of darkness.
[66:08.25]I've been there before.
[66:10.25]Sometimes when you fucking ate pints deep, you know, you gotta pee.
[66:16.70]There is beauty.
[66:18.76]There is also.
[66:19.90]Thank you for telling me.
[66:21.34]I've never been there before.
[66:27.70]Is this your first time?
[66:37.26]He's a toilet like a fucking civilized motherfucker.
[66:44.61]Yes, it's the first time we've been this far from home.
[66:48.05]There was an incident.
[66:49.25]Then we ended up here.
[66:53.82]Bro is day drinking in Flora Wish.
[66:56.12]Yeah.
[66:59.66]Yeah, day drinking when there's wishes and magic and magical dresses and clothes to put on.
[67:05.69]Yeah, I don't know if I would be day drinking right now.
[67:08.11]I'd be putting on cool clothes that'd make me fly.
[67:12.38]Okay.
[67:19.69]When I spot a new face in FloraWish, I gift them some wish flight paper.
[67:29.80]Consider it a blessing, a gift from the wishing one.
[67:34.46]He was the first, you know.
[67:36.34]He created wish flight paper as a boon to all.
[67:41.95]The bees have smiley faces, do they really?
[67:43.77]Just lucky, I guess.
[67:44.57]Mr. Gallio.
[68:13.99]I'm sorry, Giovanni.
[68:15.77]I don't need the wish flight paper I ordered earlier.
[68:18.73]Please, sell it to someone else.
[68:23.22]I gotta go.
[68:24.16]See you.
[68:26.64]Strange.
[68:29.80]What's wrong?
[68:34.84]Everybody has, like, fresh makeup powdered faces.
[68:37.52]Everybody looks phenomenal in this town.
[68:39.20]I guess it is the town of stylists that would make sense then, wouldn't it?
[68:42.08]Here.
[69:05.07]Write down your wish on the paper.
[69:08.01]It'll turn into a crane and then fly away.
[69:17.58]And fly toward the wish bottle.
[69:19.16]Oh, really?
[69:20.00]Oh.
[69:20.06]Oh, my heart.
[69:26.50]OK, so I'm going to get the right of wish.
[69:35.08]Oh, okay.
[69:42.72]Excuse me, miss.
[69:51.21]Oh, hello.
[69:51.91]Are you talking to me?
[69:53.63]I'm Nikki.
[69:56.53]Miss Nikki, Miss Nikki, hi.
[69:58.57]I just wanted to say, uh... Oh, look at that chubby cat.
[70:03.65]So cute.
[70:05.69]What do you mean, don't make any wishes?
[70:11.19]Why?
[70:12.33]That's a different department.
[70:13.57]I'm sorry.
[70:14.05]It has nothing to do with me.
[70:33.36]I'm here to show up and absolutely slay and then leave.
[70:38.18]I'm not supposed to be doing that, whatever that is.
[70:44.22]I'm sure you're right.
[70:45.24]Sounds really bad.
[70:46.61]By the way, who's Miss Ninoy?
[70:48.51]This is where you kind of run over and you grab somebody and go, hey, are you an employee?
[70:52.37]And you have to just kind of go, kinda.
[70:57.47]You don't know her?
[70:59.43]She's the intern keeper of the Dream Warehouse.
[71:02.23]She collects everyone's wishes and stores them there.
[71:05.77]It's the coolest job in all of Flora Wish.
[71:08.71]Oh, I had a dream last night.
[71:11.40]Oh, about what?
[71:12.82]Jean, come on.
[71:16.48]Ah, right.
[71:17.28]Sorry, Ruby.
[71:18.64]So anyway, thanks to Noi was supposed to replace
[71:22.97]Alright, replace the strings.
[71:23.83]That's scary.
[71:24.37]You can read people's minds?
[71:46.33]my power fades every now and then so it's not that great just grab somebody's head and just like feel the energy going through my fingertips uh-huh yeah she can even hear all her wishes we make it secret
[72:10.55]You know, I don't think there's a nice way to read somebody's mind.
[72:13.23]I don't think that's how it works.
[72:14.09]I think it's literally two hands being placed on either ear and gripping, pulling close to your face, and screaming.
[72:22.80]I think that's the only way that you can actually... That, to me, is the only way that makes any sense.
[72:34.05]I wish I could be brave enough to sleep alone at night.
[72:37.31]So Miss Ninoy taught me a song.
[72:39.87]It's a short little tune, but it works like a charm.
[72:45.12]Can you demonstrate?
[72:47.50]It goes.
[72:49.40]Why the screaming?
[72:50.26]Because if I'm going in your mind and you're there, that's going to be hell for both of us.
[72:56.45]It's going to be, it's going to be hell.
[73:01.00]You know what does Wolverine say?
[73:02.04]It hurts every time.
[73:04.32]You know how weird that would be to be inside somebody else's fucking mind?
[73:10.47]I would be screaming.
[73:11.33]It would be like that every time.
[73:21.82]I don't think you can be chill about something like that.
[73:24.50]That's not a chill thing to do.
[73:25.46]Alright, just one.
[73:51.73]You got it.
[73:52.07]Collect floof.
[73:52.99]Easy.
[73:53.39]An animal grooming outfit?
[73:54.51]Oh right, I can probably make something at this point, right?
[73:57.85]Alright, the Heart of Infinity.
[74:30.07]Get it?
[74:30.25]Yeah.
[74:38.51]Grants the ability to groom animals in exchange for valuable materials.
[74:41.25]Okay.
[74:47.16]Wait, you can keep going down.
[74:48.22]This is like the animal grooming tree.
[75:02.48]Okay, so I got this one now.
[75:04.26]Now I have to actually go to here.
[75:05.73]And this requires what?
[75:12.37]Oh, I can do it.
[75:13.01]Okay, let's just make it.
[75:20.34]That's cute.
[75:20.72]I like that.
[75:34.56]Cool.
[75:36.08]And it's sweet too.
[75:37.64]Oh, what?
[75:38.51]It's sweet.
[75:40.33]Oh my god.
[75:42.69]Oh my god.
[75:45.49]Oh my god.
[75:47.23]Do you see?
[75:49.33]It's so crazy.
[75:50.37]Okay.
[75:52.21]So now I gotta find like a dog or cat or something.
[76:02.94]Uh-huh.
[76:06.93]Oh, some animals can bite you.
[76:35.13]the fuck is this game LOL yeah you're saying that as you're at 35 downloaded that's fine here you go
[76:54.98]It's not that absurd of a game.
[76:56.64]No, it's not.
[76:57.82]I think this is actually just like a... It's just a game where you can dress up and there's tons of accessories and clothing items.
[77:07.79]Okay.
[77:23.04]Does that mean I get a chance to fulfill your wishes?
[77:25.26]Of course!
[77:29.28]Somebody just said it's very cute and normal.
[77:31.36]Oh, okay.
[77:34.01]Now I have a wish bottle.
[77:37.25]It's very cute and normal, okay?
[77:49.48]Can I just read somebody else's wish?
[77:50.82]That kind of feels weird.
[77:51.92]Doesn't feel great.
[77:53.61]Should I not be doing this?
[77:57.67]Alright, so they need to hang the bottle.
[78:04.69]How do I... How do I get it up there?
[78:15.92]Oh, it's in a very specific place.
[78:28.78]This is my kind of game, but I'm not a hater.
[78:30.32]I mean, this is not my kind of game either.
[78:34.32]But I'm still here.
[78:44.97]I understand the concept.
[78:47.71]I understand why people would buy it.
[78:49.95]I understand why you would want it.
[78:51.05]I understand why you would want to collect all the outfits.
[78:56.99]I get it.
[78:58.97]Did you kill anything yet?
[78:59.77]A couple things died.
[79:00.90]Half hour ago.
[79:15.60]This is my nine-year-old sister's favorite game, so I'm glad you're playing it.
[79:19.04]Well, I'm glad I played your nine-year-old sister's favorite game and your nine-year-old brother's favorite game because we just played Marvel Rivals.
[79:25.67]So I'm glad to cover all the bases today.
[79:27.93]I thought I heard Gene and Ruby singing.
[79:31.49]Huh?
[79:33.19]But we weren't singing.
[79:34.63]Not a single note.
[79:36.82]Where are the guns?

[86:47.30]I'm Nikki, a new stylist here in Flora Wish.
[86:54.24]Don't underestimate Nikki, even if she is new.
[86:57.86]Dada and Bebe agree, she's super talented.
[87:02.69]Uh, Miss Dada kinda says that about every new stylist.
[87:07.33]The blonde kid reminds you of SpongeBob?
[87:10.79]I think that you just liked that show a lot.
[87:17.79]I think you just really liked that show because you seemed to make a reference to people looking like SpongeBob every 20 minutes.
[87:24.04]That's true.
[87:39.35]I hate that you're making me laugh with that because it's stupid.
[87:42.57]Oh, I need a food bee?
[87:47.45]That's what I was looking for an hour ago.
[87:51.15]I wanted a bug catching outfit at 4 o'clock.
[88:10.44]Okay, this is the bug catching outfit.
[88:13.90]Somebody said to go open all your mail.
[88:15.48]I'm going to do that after this.
[88:16.24]Okay.
[88:24.96]So, multiple bug catching outfits.
[88:37.81]Oh, shit, I need a yarn.
[88:38.89]Okay, I...
[88:40.55]I know how to do that.
[88:41.11]I can't do it to the cat.
[88:52.36]Where's that dog?
[88:57.66]There's the bee.
[89:03.44]I want to give it a try.
[89:04.41]Oh, I can do it.
[89:10.64]Okay, after the kids do it, you can do it.
[89:16.88]First go to the surprise-o-matic.
[89:18.50]Looks like a lot of fun.
[89:33.15]Alright, it's my turn.
[89:54.02]Is this just... What is this doing?
[89:58.21]Putting on just random clothes?
[90:00.59]Do I get to keep these?
[90:09.01]It's just meaningless?
[90:09.71]Oh, okay.
[90:11.35]Alright, craft the afternoon shine outfit.
[90:14.17]I need a yarn.
[90:23.53]That should be inspiration for new outfit ideas.
[90:25.45]Oh, interesting.
[90:27.13]Okay.
[90:39.49]That should do it.
[90:41.29]Yep.
[90:58.32]Cool hat.
[91:05.49]Very nice.
[91:07.01]Alright, so somebody said open all your mail.
[91:11.59]Hold down the tab key.
[91:17.59]Interesting.
[91:18.19]So you swap your ability.
[91:25.65]Bugs, yeah.
[91:31.52]Okay, so catching bugs is the same thing as grooming an animal.
[91:47.31]Ah, you can track all the shit that you're looking for.
[91:49.25]Okay.
[91:50.87]Um, I saw a bug two seconds ago.
[91:58.18]There you are.
[92:05.93]Okay, got a bee.
[92:16.21]Please, you're male.
[92:17.05]Please, you're male.
[92:17.92]How do I get to it?
[92:27.70]OK, so just do I get a bunch of stuff?
[92:30.12]Alright, claim everything.
[92:35.20]I got hair.
[92:35.84]OK.
[92:44.84]Just gave me a bunch of shit.
[92:56.22]Does this do anything?
[92:59.99]Are there any powers?
[93:01.37]Ooh!
[93:04.33]We can go gamble right now.
[93:10.38]Okay, claim everything.
[93:17.04]Okay.
[93:18.34]I have... I have 450 resonance.
[93:21.74]Resonance.
[93:27.20]Every 10 residences guarantees a 4 star or higher piece.
[93:31.29]Do I watch an ad for 10,000 coins?
[93:34.51]That feels like a lot.
[93:43.07]Should I do 10 or do 1?
[93:43.85]How does this work out here?
[93:46.27]What's the math here?
[93:52.23]Do 1, 1, 1, 10, 10, 10.
[94:00.30]What are you talking about?
[94:01.02]I had 400... Oh, it's a different one.
[94:03.04]It's not the same.
[94:06.18]What?
[94:06.48]These are diamonds.
[94:14.72]Didn't I just get a bunch of currency?
[94:16.48]I thought I just got my mail and I got a bunch of stuff.
[94:24.34]Other banner.
[94:27.81]Oh...
[94:35.00]I have 21.
[94:35.54]I was trying to get this one.
[94:40.88]Here we go.
[94:42.12]Oh my god.
[94:52.41]I got a bag.
[94:52.95]Sneakers.
[95:00.78]I don't know.
[95:01.54]I...
[95:03.81]Oh, it's the... Okay, I thought it was the shoes for a second.
[95:08.96]Okay.
[95:13.28]Another bag?
[95:14.22]Ponytail.
[95:21.03]Another floral net.
[95:26.81]Is that an unusual?
[95:27.63]This one is.
[95:31.05]Drifting shark fin.
[95:32.27]It's cool.
[95:34.57]And I just, I got something.
[95:36.35]I got fishing.
[95:37.02]I can fish now.
[95:37.66]And apparently I look like this.
[95:41.08]It's a four star.
[95:47.26]Melted cream.
[95:51.96]So I can put all these on.
[95:53.03]That's alright.
[95:55.35]That's cool.
[95:55.97]At least you can do something with the stuff that you open.
[96:00.90]I have no idea.
[96:01.74]I just need more money.
[96:03.12]Or more.
[96:03.86]Oh, I can do it again.
[96:07.56]I have no idea what the monetization is like in this game, but I can imagine it's going to be there.
[96:12.39]I have no idea.
[96:13.99]Okay.
[96:21.96]I like that.
[96:23.86]That's a good one.
[96:26.44]Keep getting these.
[96:33.41]That's cool too.
[96:33.99]So what do you do with your doubles?
[96:40.04]Does it turn into something else?
[96:41.40]Oh, I think it does this.

[101:23.76]Black with black.
[101:24.98]Boring ResidentSleeper.
[101:28.24]Well, I only have a certain amount of shoes.
[101:36.24]Black and pink?
[101:38.39]It's a classic look.
[101:39.27]There's nothing wrong with it.
[101:44.50]Okay.
[101:56.68]What else?
[102:02.10]Oh, it's a little hair piece.
[102:11.62]I like this.
[102:12.38]I think this works.
[102:13.20]I don't know if this works with the.
[102:25.83]The black blouse here.
[102:37.31]Kind of works with this.
[102:38.15]It just it's blue though.
[102:44.74]Is there something else?
[103:04.64]I want to do gloves.
[103:09.83]It's gotta be something for gloves, right?
[103:12.49]Hands?
[103:22.65]You're wearing gloves.
[103:23.37]Yeah, I want to either take them off or can I take off the gloves?
[103:29.06]Keep scrolling down.
[103:29.88]I think this is it.
[103:35.36]Oh, there it is.
[103:44.27]Gloves or no gloves?
[103:45.09]I think no gloves.
[103:46.29]No gloves.
[103:58.00]I think I'm happy with this.
[104:04.23]And that purse.
[104:06.83]Good to go.
[104:12.15]Okay, let me tell you my philosophy on this.
[104:15.30]You've got the blue in the hair.
[104:19.41]Blue crystals, which match the bag.
[104:23.52]I do have a head.
[104:24.78]Oh, that headband, I think.
[104:26.32]No, it's not.
[104:28.96]Is it clashing?
[104:38.41]It's clashing a little, but it's okay.
[104:39.87]Alright.
[104:49.47]The necklace has got to go.
[104:56.39]Can I see a good view?
[105:00.92]That necklace does got to go.
[105:02.36]No, it does.
[105:12.07]I'm not a big fan of it.
[105:14.57]The hair might have to go too.
[105:17.79]I hate it.
[105:18.19]I hate everything.
[105:18.88]I don't like anything about this.
[105:22.06]Throw the whole look away.
[105:48.47]OK.
[106:21.77]I think it's this one.
[106:33.60]This little jacket seems to change things a little.
[106:39.29]We gotta get that necklace off.
[106:47.67]Shit, I didn't want to do that.
[106:51.75]No, no, and it's ruined.
[106:53.01]We're fine.
[107:03.38]Where is this necklace?
[107:07.44]Oh, okay.
[107:11.62]Nah.
[107:16.69]Hmm.
[107:18.15]Hmm.
[107:19.29]Hmm.
[107:24.77]I think so.
[107:26.69]We gotta get rid of the blue though.
[107:29.17]Or... I don't like bows.
[107:36.13]I feel like it's just gonna be talking like this.
[107:38.85]I feel like it's choking.
[107:46.54]It's fine.
[107:47.08]It's fine.
[107:47.50]It's fine.
[107:47.88]Okay.
[107:51.86]I'm happy with this.
[108:14.33]This is like the whole point of the game.
[108:15.89]Okay.
[108:16.49]For those of you that are saying, dude, why don't you play the game?
[108:18.67]You best start believing in ghost stories because you're in one.
[108:23.25]Okay.
[108:25.59]This is the game.
[108:26.31]Nope.
[108:37.44]I didn't.
[108:37.96]Okay.
[108:40.04]I want to bring the camera down.
[108:44.89]How do I get like free cam?
[109:52.23]Oof, too much.
[110:03.52]I mean, without the wooden floor, I don't know why I need to do this in a garden.
[110:39.86]Hold it right there.

[111:40.63]It's a nice little accessory.
[111:50.24]Okay, materials for clothes.
[111:51.46]This is preparing in the game.
[111:52.84]Oh, God.
[112:05.36]Let's go shopping.
[112:06.81]Yippee.
[112:12.29]Grandpa is scary.
[112:19.74]No way I could have done this without you.
[112:27.54]This had better be currency to open up rest boxes with.
[112:32.97]Thank you, Ninoy.
[112:34.51]Can't wait to try it on.
[112:38.37]On you, it'll look great.
[112:40.21]Yeah, yeah, it sure will.
[112:42.63]But, Ninoy, what's going on with you today?
[112:46.63]You don't make mistakes like this.
[112:52.62]I... I... I don't know what to say.
[113:01.20]Hmm?
[113:01.38]Huh?
[113:01.54]Hmm?
[113:24.84]It's just because he has these big blue eyes.
[113:53.96]There's blonde hair.
[113:54.86]Okay, I guess.
[113:55.96]Whatever.
[113:56.20]He's got a tie on.
[113:56.86]Yeah, well, what?
[113:58.12]No, he doesn't.
[113:58.80]He's wearing overalls.
[113:59.68]Okay.
[114:17.92]He's got freckles.
[114:18.54]I mean, how mad is this girl that I just look way better than her?
[114:49.49]Oh, she gave me earrings.
[115:01.14]Level 3.
[115:01.36]Alright, well, you know, you can keep going.
[115:05.34]She keeps pausing to talk to me.
[115:07.56]What are you, me?
[115:08.18]That's what I do the whole fucking stream.
[115:30.18]Let me pee.
[115:30.84]I gotta pee.
[115:39.62]I'll be right back.
[115:40.66]It's pee time.
[118:50.26]Yeah, anybody saying anything other than waltzing, you're just wrong.
[118:56.30]That's what I would have picked.
[119:08.05]Okay, I'm probably not going to play for that much longer.
[119:10.53]And for all you Infinity Nikki fans out there, I will tell you.
[119:15.61]I'm going to give you a review.
[119:16.79]I'm going to give you the review.
[119:17.73]Okay, I'll give you the review.
[119:22.96]And I also have a proposition for you.
[119:27.76]My proposition is, uh, is I come back with this game after spending some time with it on the couch with my girlfriend.
[119:45.79]Can I do that?
[119:48.17]And then maybe I could just showcase some outfits.
[119:56.22]It's too early for a review.
[120:01.48]I understand it.
[120:02.62]I understand.
[120:15.97]I just, I feel like it's going to take 10 hours to really get into it.
[120:23.32]And I think I'd rather get into it and then show you some stuff.
[120:31.07]I don't mind playing too.
[120:32.01]I mean, it's just a comfortable little cozy game.
[120:35.57]I'm not freaking out about anybody on the cart.
[120:37.99]I would love a wardrobe tour in like a month.
[120:53.96]It'll probably be sooner than that.
[120:55.18]Redeem codes for free stuff.
[120:57.30]Oh, new character.
[120:57.98]Do a dress-off with Holly.
[121:25.29]I think I would lose that every time.
[121:29.31]Every time I would lose that.
[121:32.86]She's an artist.
[121:35.54]She'd be so detailed.
[121:37.50]I'd be like, I like this because it makes, I like the way it makes my face look.
[121:42.16]She's going to be so meticulous.
[121:43.54]It's going to be, everything's going to be beautiful.
[121:46.66]after speaking with miss dada we believe that the cause but you're a diva though that is true we've turned the investigation over to the stylist guild we'll assist where we can what are you doing the Dark Souls clip stream yeah I said that like a year ago didn't I whim did all of this nanoy before your mom passed out did anything strange happen
[122:13.25]Add another promise stream to the pile.
[122:15.97]You want to investigate?
[122:17.43]Yes.
[122:32.96]Of course, I've got this.
[122:34.94]The case is yours, Nikki.
[122:37.32]I believe if anyone can solve this dicey problem, it's you.
[122:41.04]Right now, we plan on looking closely at the victims displaying early signs before... Oh no, a stylist is showing symptoms.
[122:47.47]Her name is Dorsey.
[122:48.71]She's the leader of the Golden Daisies.
[122:52.75]They were amazing stylists back in the day.
[122:54.73]I can't believe... She lives over by Silken Lake.
[123:00.43]Okay.
[123:01.65]We'll go find this and then I'm probably going to call it for today.
[123:06.60]Excuse me, miss.
[123:11.48]Me?
[123:13.34]I'm Nikki.
[123:14.32]And this is my friend Momo.
[123:15.86]Is this guy?
[123:16.82]Yes.
[123:17.74]You, Miss Nikki.
[123:20.91]I saw you talking with Miss Dada.
[123:22.57]Is this like a humanified toad?
[123:24.55]And they seem serious.
[123:26.19]Did they entrust?
[123:26.83]No, it's not.
[123:27.31]Don't say SpongeBob.
[123:28.53]Give me a break.
[123:40.90]Yeah, who are you?
[123:41.32]Who is this?
[123:42.34]Is there any conflict in this world?
[124:11.77]I feel like there isn't.
[124:15.55]I handle operations and maintain the Warp Spire.
[124:18.61]But what I enjoy the most is teaching stylists how to use the Warp Spire.
[124:28.52]There's tons of conflict.
[124:30.32]I only know its teleportation function.
[124:32.68]Can it do something else?
[124:34.96]Of course.
[124:36.18]The Warp Spire provides access to all the resources I mentioned before.
[124:41.04]You're probably going to get invaded by other players who are going to kill you.
[124:47.20]There's an epidemic going on right now.
[124:52.17]Am I not paying attention?
[124:53.95]Unexplained coma incidents.
[125:12.18]Investigate the frequent unexplained coma incidents in Flora Wish with Nonoi.
[125:15.78]Okay.
[125:19.53]So I can fast travel, right?
[125:24.35]I get 30 bucks for this.
[125:25.36]Let's do it.
[125:28.20]Let's go.
[125:28.72]I get 10,000 bucks for this, actually.
[125:49.39]You didn't even buy anything?
[125:50.53]Oh my god, I didn't.
[125:55.15]You're right.
[125:55.45]Uh, is there a buy thing?
[126:14.49]Silken Lake.
[126:30.14]play oh there's a little mini game okay dodge the trees
[126:48.58]Oh shit.
[126:49.28]Oh my god.
[126:52.00]Oh, I think you have to tilt all the way to the left.
[126:53.76]Alright, I got it.
[126:59.41]I got it.
[126:59.71]Okay, it's weird.
[127:00.29]I pressed the wrong button.
[127:01.51]Q-E-A-D.
[127:03.29]I'm using two hands.
[127:14.32]How do you get around this?
[127:17.13]I have to use two hands.
[127:18.35]I'm so fucking my brain doesn't work.
[127:21.39]I have to use two hands for this.
[127:30.26]You have to tilt all the way.
[127:58.86]I can't fucking do this.
[128:12.80]Dude, it's way harder than it looks.
[128:14.94]I'm telling you.
[128:15.72]Go get it.
[128:16.26]Go play the game right now.
[128:17.72]It's way weirder.
[128:18.94]It's slow.
[128:19.96]It's like slow.
[128:27.44]This is fucking hard.
[128:28.74]Somebody said you don't have to dodge and I said, yeah, you do.
[128:48.72]Stop moving lanes, just tilt.
[128:51.82]What?
[129:06.11]I assumed that if you were on the track with the object that is also on the track that you were gonna get hit.
[129:30.91]Did you have zero sense of timing?
[129:32.95]That is one thing that I'm going to tell you is absolutely not true.
[129:35.33]I like 100% in Rhythm Heaven and people in the chat were telling me, dude, it took me like six years to beat that game.
[129:42.11]I did it in one go in like four hours.
[129:51.51]I beat Space Channel 5 in one sitting without losing one life.
[129:55.86]Don't tell me I can't play rhythm games.
[129:57.72]I beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.

[132:12.21]Thank you.
[132:44.46]Fall off a cliff.
[132:48.83]This is just all the tutorials.

[135:01.63]Jumbo-sized gumball machine.
[135:07.69]It's not a grill, it's a surprise-o-matic created by the whale consortium.
[135:11.63]It sells random pieces of clothing.
[135:14.08]The blings go clack, the liver goes clunk, and the ball of surprises comes tumbling down.

[141:03.03]Yeah, are you?
[141:04.29]Okay.
[141:05.35]Stop.
[141:07.39]I threw a sweatshirt on.
[141:08.85]It's chilly out.
[141:09.55]It's 58 degrees outside.
[141:13.20]I put a little warm sweatshirt on.
[141:15.84]This is not a one-star outfit.
[141:20.16]This is a practical outfit.
[141:21.74]This is called be warm and be happy.
[141:28.10]I just completely changed my outfit.
[141:29.49]Thanks a lot, guys.
[141:38.85]These styles don't match.
[141:41.33]What do you mean? ...
[141:56.78]I mean, is that better?
[141:57.56]Does that work?
[141:58.24]I think this is better.
[141:59.30]What do you mean, no?
[142:18.72]Put on something.
[142:19.40]Put a shirt on.
[142:19.96]Put something on.
[142:20.58]Put something else on.
[142:24.30]If I not have, I'm confused.
[142:26.46]I don't have a shirt on.
[142:40.96]Now that works.
[142:44.25]No, it doesn't.
[142:44.65]Wait, what?
[143:05.45]Am I not putting pants on?
[143:18.12]Now put on the sweater.
[143:21.96]It is on.
[143:26.33]Isn't this a top and a bottom?
[143:31.19]Oh!
[143:44.37]Okay.
[143:58.15]Um, just to make sure everyone here is very, very clear.
[144:02.73]If I walked out of spawn in Marvel Rivals with my back to the enemy team walking backwards while I stuck my tongue out on camera, I would get less criticisms than my previous outfit.
[144:33.36]OK, uh, secrets of the warp spire.
[144:58.88]I could spread my asshole and fart into the webcam and there'd be less- there'd be less dissent than this chat is right now with my previous outfit.
[145:27.82]Nobody says you're wrong on that man.
[145:29.76]And that one was a little too far.
[145:31.06]Oh.
[146:05.31]Okay, but honestly the outfit was awful.
[146:07.39]Was it though?
[146:08.39]I think it was fine.
[146:19.31]You wear white after Labor Day and all of a sudden people fucking want to tear your eyes out.
[146:29.28]Uh, okay.
[146:31.12]I wanted to buy.
[146:32.06]I can enter the realm of escalation.
[146:39.43]Is that the thing?
[146:40.19]Is this the contest?
[146:42.07]Imagine if I showed up looking like this.
[146:45.29]Everybody would just leave.
[146:47.94]I don't think it's this.
[146:48.57]Into the realm of escalation you- Oh, I have to use the warp spark.
[147:16.19]Are you going to fart into a lighter on stream or is that delayed as well?
[147:19.81]Oh, that's permanently delayed.
[147:21.45]Okay.
[147:21.85]So where's this board?
[147:23.31]Isn't it right here?
[147:23.97]Let's start it.
[147:34.45]Realm of Escalation.
[147:36.80]This is the one, right?
[147:41.54]Okay.
[147:46.78]What's the point of this game?
[147:48.58]You collect a ton of clothing and you attempt to look as good as I do.
[147:56.61]And I think eventually you fight people with your outfits.
[148:01.85]You actually have a style battle and if your fit sucks, you lose.
[148:14.56]Select a target.
[148:15.32]Go on.
[148:17.02]Yeah.
[148:19.52]Items you wish to escalate.
[148:20.76]How much should I do?
[148:32.79]Go all in with everything.
[148:34.67]Take it all.
[148:40.60]This is $130,000. $130,000.
[148:44.96]It costs 130 to go in.
[148:45.71]What does this mean?
[148:54.19]Oh, okay.
[148:57.26]You should just go to the store.
[149:02.82]The stream is going to essentially be ending here in the next 10 minutes or so after I do this.
[149:06.83]I'm just going to do it.
[149:07.55]I want to see what this does.
[149:12.83]We'll do this.
[149:13.41]I'll go gamble a couple more times.
[149:15.67]And then I'll probably see you later.
[149:30.56]Oh, shit.
[149:30.96]It gave me a lot.
[149:32.08]Okay.
[149:34.10]So, this is where you come to turn your extra stuff into money?
[149:38.06]That's got three levels.
[149:39.86]Two or three levels for doing that.
[149:42.97]Okay.
[149:48.83]The boutique from earlier sells a lot of clothes.
[149:51.41]Go to SpongeBob's store for a lot of clothes.
[149:53.11]Okay.
[150:01.90]Um... Where is that store?
[150:05.46]Here?
[150:05.66]Here?
[150:12.60]Yeah, I know SpongeBob.
[150:13.96]What is his name in the game?
[150:16.11]Okay, Marky.
[150:17.43]Mark.
[150:23.91]You're going to do an Infinity Nikki Invitational?
[150:42.50]That would be a lot of fun, but that would require me to have to have a bunch of streamers all get to Infinity Nikki mid game.
[150:52.85]And I doubt that is going to happen.
[150:54.41]Alright, what do you got?
[150:59.09]Alright, I have 163,000.
[151:15.15]you can try it on purchase it I don't want to purchase that that's expensive okay okay oh man there's a lot of stuff
[151:42.26]I like this one.
[151:45.68]Hmm.
[151:57.61]This one's... I like this one.
[151:58.55]This one's nice.
[152:02.49]Hmm.
[152:16.21]Very sparkly.
[152:25.86]Oh shit.
[152:36.56]We could make something work with that.
[152:44.09]I'm just going to buy all this stuff.
[152:45.45]How much money do I have?
[152:46.03]I put in sweatshirt.
[153:04.50]That's $26,000, but it should go with a lot of stuff.
[153:14.58]Alright, let's get the pants.
[153:15.50]Because this could go with a couple of the more informal tops.
[153:34.00]Okay.
[153:39.94]What else we got here?
[153:40.76]I need something like black.
[153:43.00]Yeah, I need something like black.
[153:44.24]Different colored socks.
[153:45.78]Is that all there is?
[153:51.44]Okay.
[153:56.01]What's up with these?
[154:09.50]We have a lot of dark clothes.
[154:12.00]I'm just going to go with these.
[154:17.95]No, I guess these?
[154:20.39]Get bottom right.
[154:28.43]Hey, hey, hey.
[154:29.96]Don't make me fall into the camera again.
[154:51.87]These are wild.
[155:00.58]I don't know.
[155:03.86]Get the boots.
[155:04.26]Are these expensive?
[155:07.70]These are only... Okay, 65.
[155:08.86]I'm upset at money.
[155:25.49]I like these.
[155:27.68]Alright, I'm going to stop.
[155:28.84]I want to pull the gambling machine once.
[155:40.27]What the hell is this?
[155:47.04]It's going to be alright.
[155:48.50]I can assure you.
[155:49.18]Okay.
[155:50.74]We're going to do this.
[156:17.45]Okay.
[156:19.33]Okay.
[156:23.35]Oh, this needs to be longer.
[156:35.40]This is cool.
[156:36.12]There we go.
[156:40.52]That's longer, right?
[156:41.27]There we go.
[156:43.14]I don't like the blue though.
[156:47.28]I think it matches everything else, but.
[156:54.10]You are such a fashionista.
[156:59.28]No, go back, you fool.
[157:04.04]Like this?
[157:06.06]What about the boots?
[157:08.16]Oh, right.
[157:08.56]Yeah.
[157:16.79]Okay, the frills on the wrists, those are going to come off.
[157:33.73]No red.
[157:34.47]Yeah, the boots are messing everything up.
[157:36.39]Uh-oh.
[157:39.51]This is not business formal anymore.
[157:41.34]Oh, shit.
[157:41.96]You're right.
[157:49.57]Do red hair, red hair, red hair, red hair.
[158:00.18]Chase those shit boots.
[158:01.70]What?
[158:01.92]What do you mean shit boots?
[158:14.40]I mean, this is a look, isn't it?
[158:15.68]This is a look.
[158:21.53]This dude, he's cooked.
[158:22.71]He's so cooked.
[158:23.97]What did I do?
[158:24.61]What are you talking about?
[158:25.73]This is a look.
[158:47.25]There's always somebody that's better than you at fucking video games.
[158:51.25]There's always somebody that's smarter than you.
[158:52.91]There's always somebody that's more fashion-forward than you.
[158:55.94]There's always somebody that knows the color theory better than you.
[158:58.16]There's always somebody that's a better dentist than you'll ever be.
[159:00.22]There's always somebody that's a better surgeon than you'll ever be.
[159:03.66]What can I do, huh?
[159:05.20]What can I do?
[159:08.52]If not be a dentist, okay?
[159:11.51]What can I do?
[159:17.59]Or not be a dentist.
[159:18.53]Sorry, let me change that.
[159:23.21]Wait, you can just go... Oh, that's what it is.
[159:25.85]Okay, every time I see these sandals, I'm like, what the hell am I... Okay, I get it.
[159:28.99]Alright, let's make all the fashion people very mad now because... Let's just see how fucked up we can make everything.
[160:16.98]Actually, like not bad.
[160:25.94]We just need something... Okay, we need...
[160:49.17]I wanted to look... I'm going back to the way that I looked.
[160:53.23]I don't want to hear anything from anybody.
[160:54.58]I don't want to hear shit.
[161:13.72]Get rid of that purse and we're good.
[161:15.84]We're done.
[161:16.66]Get rid of that purse and we're done.
[161:23.74]Raise it first.
[161:25.12]There.
[161:53.69]Can we all agree?
[161:54.45]Does this look fine?
[161:55.97]Does this look okay?
[161:57.29]Alright, we got to search for Dorsey.
[162:04.22]Yeah.
[162:11.42]That skirt isn't long enough.
[162:13.68]Jack it off, you idiot.
[162:24.81]jacket off um no the jacket is staying on alright we're gonna go find this dude over here oh actually into the open world it's only been like an hour I'm in the menu for like an hour and a half I actually I'm
[162:55.55]I'm not raring to get out of here.
[163:01.26]I'm enjoying the different interesting things to see in the game.
[163:10.42]I'll find you, brother.
[163:14.39]Dominic!
[163:16.77]Dominic!
[163:24.19]It's the gambling, isn't it?
[163:25.11]I'm pretty sure she can't hear anything we're saying.
[163:28.01]She seemed just fine yesterday, but now... Ster was right.
[163:34.38]You love it.
[163:34.96]You know what?
[163:35.74]I bet you Ster would like this game too.
[163:37.06]The wish envoy.
[163:37.68]I made a wish.
[163:50.13]to bring back my brother and the sketch it seems like she only reacts to her brother's name dominic oh he would like ludwig yeah dorsey might listen except dominic went missing 15 years ago what
[164:21.99]You think Ster is lurking right now?
[164:23.79]Ster might be streaming right now.
[164:25.57]He could be live right now.
[164:26.65]Missing persons case 10 or so stylists mysteriously disappeared.
[164:30.17]All in one night here in Wishfield.
[164:34.33]Dominic was one of them.
[164:35.73]Even now.
[164:37.23]No one knows what happened or where they went.
[164:40.91]Could you make your character look like Lois Griffin?
[164:43.89]Yeah.
[164:45.63]That is so awful.
[164:47.03]Hold on Momo.
[164:48.35]Dorsey also mentioned someone else.
[164:50.85]Huh?
[164:51.41]Who?
[164:55.11]The wish envoy.
[164:56.41]The wish envoy?
[164:58.75]Maybe it's like a special title.
[165:01.12]What?
[165:01.38]Momo in the meat grinder.
[165:03.18]I never heard of him before.
[165:06.00]Miss Noma, do you know this wish envoy?
[165:11.29]Not really.
[165:13.57]Maybe you should ask Sly and Farini.
[165:16.99]They might know.
[165:20.02]devilish thoughts I that's such I love that term oh devilish oh it's so devilish yes my daughter doesn't discuss her life because of my poor hell she had they've been they've been busy preparing for a stylist contest
[165:49.84]To do an IRL makeover stream?
[165:51.78]Yeah, that would be just a joke.
[165:53.76]I would pay a bunch of stylists to make me up and do me up like crazy.
[165:58.82]Do a complete makeover.
[166:00.61]Make me look awesome.
[166:01.71]Make me look super stunning and beautiful and manly and whatever they want to do.
[166:07.97]And then walk out.
[166:10.45]Do like a walkout to music.
[166:12.71]One of the judges pukes.
[166:14.96]And me and the judge have like a Peter Griffin fucking chicken fight for the rest of the stream.
[166:22.14]Like I'm smashing chairs over this over this person's head and like they're shattering glass bottles over my head and stuff.
[166:31.83]Like I'm on the ground being literally choked like and I'm turning purple.
[166:37.20]The other judges don't do anything.
[166:43.14]But I feel like they're hiding something.
[166:46.40]I had no idea where they usually practice styling.
[166:50.18]Used to be, those two always went to Timmis, the cosmetics mer- Color palettes?
[166:56.32]Is she a stylist too?
[167:04.49]Yeah, and my name, my name would be, oh, are you going to come up with an alias for like a track?
[167:10.93]I'd be like, yeah, my name is going purple or turning purple.
[167:14.61]And I have a purple dress on.
[167:16.49]But what you don't know is at the very end, like I am literally turning purple on the ground because I'm being choked by someone that's trying to kill me.
[167:26.80]If you're trying to find Salai and Farini, you should ask T-Miss at the Daisy Inn.
[167:33.61]Good, we'll go now.
[167:37.75]Nikki, you two go ahead.
[167:39.49]I'll stay and take care of Dorsey and Miss Noma.
[167:42.25]Just in case anything happens.
[167:44.27]I'm kind of a little worried about them.
[167:46.62]That happens in the game.
[167:47.70]Keep playing.
[167:49.54]That's a good idea, Ninoy.
[167:51.62]We'll go investigate.
[167:52.42]You stole my look!
[167:54.66]You fucking...
[168:01.70]There is.
[168:02.12]There is.
[168:06.54]How do I get up there?
[168:15.57]Like that?
[168:15.97]Oh, wait.
[168:20.15]It's one of these.
[168:27.61]Graffiti?
[168:29.49]Oh.
[168:47.31]Where is it?
[168:49.19]On the roof?
[168:54.50]In the haystack?
[169:20.80]The umbrella?
[169:21.36]Oh!
[169:29.13]It is the umbrella.
[169:30.03]Okay, I was looking for... Okay, it is just a star.
[169:34.77]I was looking for... It painted on the side of the house.
[169:47.93]The best part about playing this game on stream is looking over a chat and it really does seem like it's on kind of like a like a one to three minute timer in the chat.
[169:57.22]Somebody coming into the stream and saying, why are you playing this?
[170:12.99]In the box.
[170:19.62]Found it.
[170:23.88]It's running away.
[170:24.48]Get back here.
[170:35.67]Yeah, something that's hard to describe.
[170:38.55]I have, at the same time, enraged and made so many people very happy that I'm playing this game.
[170:54.06]That's a very weird feeling, isn't it?
[171:05.35]And all the people that have sunglasses on that are just laying down sleeping with the stream still open.
[171:14.59]There's only three types of viewers here.
[171:28.79]Can I touch this water?
[171:29.55]Don't listen to the haters.
[171:49.58]Hey, you can like the things that you like.
[171:54.18]I'm not telling you that you need to be super into and be so happy to play the dress-up game.
[172:02.52]No, no, no, no, no.
[172:11.62]All I'm asking is for your vote in the Fashionista contest at level 10.
[172:15.97]That's all I'm looking for.
[172:26.82]Okay, that's probably going to be it.
[172:29.26]I had fun.
[172:30.88]I actually enjoyed myself.
[172:32.14]You know, if anything, it's a good game just to have open.
[172:35.40]Just talk.
[172:36.20]Just hang out.
[172:38.04]I'm going to play this off stream.
[172:48.54]I think this is a. Yeah, like I said, I want to see what I want to see what Holly does.
[172:55.08]I want to watch Holly play this game.
[172:58.10]Because Holly is an artist and I imagine she probably would know a lot of the color stuff and.
[173:11.20]Who knows?
[173:11.54]Maybe maybe I will show you.
[173:14.52]Some of our outfits.
[173:17.51]This is still played.
[173:20.81]Next time you'll see me live will probably be... What time is it right now?
[173:24.89]What is it?
[173:25.73]Is it the 6th?
[173:28.43]Is it the 10th?
[173:31.62]Looks pretty... Looks pretty jokes aside.
[173:33.38]Yeah, I know.
[173:33.78]Everyone's just fucking around.
[173:39.56]And again, I cannot speak to the monetization policies of this game.
[173:42.16]I have no idea.
[173:46.46]But I definitely enjoyed the banter and hanging out and messing around as well.
[173:54.70]It was a fun time for me.
[173:59.37]How about next, like the 15th or the 16th?
[174:03.07]Wednesday or Thursday?
[174:07.11]Like Thursday the 16th?
[174:16.60]are we gonna do um I have a lot of games that are on a backlog maybe I'll play this too I don't know I don't really have a plan I'm just gonna a lot of games that over the last two or three years have come out that I've wanted to stream but I just haven't
[174:45.89]But yeah, that's it.
[174:46.43]That was Infinity Nikki and Marvel Rivals.
[174:50.52]I had a good time.
[175:03.84]I can't wait to see how awesome I'm going to look in my new dress in Infinity Nikki.
[175:10.89]The dress-off between Holly and Jerma.
[175:18.22]I can see the title now.
[175:29.41]Yeah, I'll see you soon.
[175:30.39]Take care.
[175:32.65]Have a good rest of your evening.
[175:37.71]Maybe I'll play some more Marvel... I can't... Saying Marvel Rivals is hard to say sometimes.
[175:43.85]My mouth gets stuck.
[175:45.73]It's like Marvel...
[175:50.05]Marvel Rivals.
[176:00.40]Take care.
[176:00.78]Call your mother.
[176:01.34]Have a good one.
[176:02.11]Have a wonderful... Have a wonderful weekend because that's what's about to start.
[176:06.15]See you later.
[176:18.18]Probably start around the same time.
