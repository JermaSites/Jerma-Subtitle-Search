[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.40]Fuck the title.
[00:03.06]The title still says, Just Chillin'.
[00:04.86]God damn it.
[00:05.46]Hold on.
[00:06.98]I need to change this right now.
[00:08.36]I wasn't supposed to be like this.
[00:11.47]Just Chillin'.
[00:12.63]Oh, no.
[00:15.49]Uh... Fuck.
[00:19.99]Lay in low.
[00:24.04]Ugh.
[00:24.90]I don't know.
[00:25.32]I have to keep it.
[00:26.44]I got nothing to put here.
[00:29.93]Title it Colonoscopy Reflections.
[00:32.44]I was gonna title it.
[00:33.38]I'm not even supposed to be here.
[00:34.42]It's only been like 30 seconds.
[00:37.24]I was gonna... Hold on.
[00:38.99]I'll be right... Hold on.
[00:39.75]See ya.
[01:02.28]Okay, I'm back.
[01:03.61]Laying low, post-colonoscopy stream session.
[01:06.67]Chill session.
[01:07.29]But this didn't just happen.
[01:09.29]I didn't just get out of the procedure.
[01:11.21]That's kind of misleading.
[01:16.99]That's a little misleading.
[01:20.23]Hey, I just got out of my colonoscopy.
[01:23.49]Five minutes ago.
[01:24.94]I'm gonna turn my stream on.
[01:29.44]How am I doing?
[01:29.86]I'm doing alright.
[01:30.52]I'm doing good.
[01:34.06]Butthole.
[01:35.02]Yeah, I walked out of it.
[01:35.90]I'm still in my, uh, what do they call them?
[01:39.00]Uh... Johnny's?
[01:40.42]What do they call them?
[01:40.99]Like, the open back ass dress?
[01:44.79]What's it called?
[01:50.35]Diapers.
[01:50.87]No, I'm talking... A gown?
[01:53.00]No, they're called like... Johns or something.
[01:58.62]Kilt?
[01:59.14]No, no, no, no.
[02:01.10]The tablecloth!
[02:03.19]The blue picnic tablecloth that has the big open S. Why does it look like that, by the way?
[02:10.35]It does.
[02:10.59]It looks like a curtain.
[02:14.79]Hospital gown.
[02:15.87]Yeah, but that's like the... That's like the technical way to say it.
[02:21.28]It's called like a... Like a gurney or something.
[02:26.59]Ugh, I know what a gurney is.
[02:28.35]I'm not stupid.
[02:30.89]Anywho, we can talk about it if you want.
[02:32.85]I'll give you some insight if anybody wants to hear about it.
[02:36.99]I mean, it depends on how much people want to hear about this.
[02:41.38]Tell me everything.
[02:42.98]Alright, I'll tell you.
[02:47.30]Alright, there's already a ResidentSleeper in the chat.
[02:49.36]Is that a bad sign?
[02:50.18]Hey, let me tell you a story about my colonoscopy.
[02:54.82]Sleep.
[02:57.17]Uh, show us your ass.
[02:59.41]Okay.
[03:00.55]No.
[03:02.03]No, it went well.
[03:03.01]Uh, I still have to hear back for a couple things.
[03:06.26]I had, like, two or three biopsies done.
[03:09.40]And it takes, like, three of... It takes, like, more than two or three weeks for you to get results back on a biopsy.
[03:17.14]Uh, I'm fine.
[03:20.90]The doctor said it doesn't have any major concerns.
[03:23.24]The reason why I did it, people are going, why are you doing a colonoscopy before like 50?
[03:27.11]I have irritable bowel disease, and if you have irritable bowel disease for more than like a decade, I started developing some new symptoms that I wasn't really used to, and fast forward, I just wanted to make sure everything was okay.
[03:45.43]And it is, apparently.
[03:48.31]Everything seems to be fine.
[03:50.71]We'll wait and hear back from the biopsies, but he said he didn't have any major concerns.
[03:54.67]And that's the end of that, I guess.
[03:56.49]I have been put on some new medication, which is very, very hard to get used to.
[04:00.12]I'm healthy.
[04:05.36]Yeah, I'm doing alright.
[04:08.74]But I'm on a new medication that's... It's kind of odd.
[04:13.14]And hard for me to get used to.
[04:15.14]So, pardon my absence for the last four days or so, like three and a half, four days.
[04:20.17]But I didn't really get, I couldn't eat anything.
[04:22.87]Even a day or two after the procedure, it was two days ago now, right?
[04:26.63]Let me see, yeah.
[04:28.65]So no, yeah, it was like two and a half days ago.
[04:31.37]I... I felt just like shit.
[04:34.05]I couldn't eat.
[04:35.59]I was eating bread and scrambled eggs for like the last two days and peanut butter.
[04:43.17]You forget how good food tastes when you don't get to eat it for four days.
[04:48.30]I can eat now?
[04:48.80]Yeah, I can eat normally now.
[04:53.82]A normal diet?
[04:55.20]Wait, bread, scrambled eggs, and peanut butter for every meal is a normal diet?
[05:01.71]I don't think so.
[05:04.43]That's normal?
[05:05.99]Every day?
[05:11.09]Don't get me wrong, I love peanut butter.
[05:17.75]Remove bread and eggs and it's good.
[05:19.53]Well, the reason why, they're easy to digest foods.
[05:23.13]White bread and scrambled eggs and peanut butter, they're easy to digest.
[05:28.62]What do I eat normally?
[05:30.06]Succulent fucking fish!
[05:32.98]broiled caviar.
[05:35.62]I couldn't eat those things.
[05:37.08]It was horrible.
[05:43.65]Roasted legumes in a creamy tomato broth.
[05:46.99]I couldn't have that.
[05:48.89]It was hell on Earth.
[05:59.25]Anywho.
[06:00.51]So let me give you a breakdown.
[06:01.55]I know I'm just kind of hanging out here.
[06:02.59]But I still am.
[06:05.01]Not 100%.
[06:06.77]I'm like 84%.
[06:08.58]Because I'm still getting like cramps.
[06:11.52]And I actually talked to the doctor today.
[06:12.72]And you're not really supposed to have abdominal pain and cramps like two or three days after.
[06:17.62]So they're like, let us know in like a couple days if you're still having that.
[06:21.78]And I'm like, okay.
[06:26.46]But I'll be fine.
[06:28.20]Don't worry about me.
[06:31.91]Let the camera in.
[06:35.27]Here's a breakdown of what's gonna happen.
[06:39.33]But let me be very clear about something.
[06:41.26]This is very important.
[06:43.60]Take care of yourself.
[06:45.16]Take care of your health.
[06:48.64]If you're able to have some issue that you want to just be reassured of, go get seen, please.
[06:55.40]You gotta take care of yourself.
[07:02.70]Just be careful.
[07:03.80]Take care of yourself.
[07:06.82]You got this one body.
[07:09.92]And you want to keep it.
[07:15.76]Hopefully... Hopefully you do.
[07:20.66]Big bits just came through.
[07:22.30]Holy shit, they did.
[07:26.66]Kali Brady gave $100.
[07:30.06]$100.
[07:30.08]10,000 bits.
[07:32.25]Thank you so much, Kali Brady.
[07:33.39]Really appreciate that.
[07:39.51]Welcome back, Jerm.
[07:40.07]I hope the recovery is brief and goes well.
[07:41.55]Keep on being...
[07:43.74]The best streamer.
[07:45.04]jermaHeart, thank you.
[07:46.80]That's fucking incredibly nice thing to say.
[07:49.51]I'm going fine, recovery's good.
[07:51.43]I'm pretty much back to normal.
[07:53.91]Which you'll see, I'll make all kinds of f- You thought like I was gonna have like a colonoscopy and I wasn't gonna have any jokes the next day?
[07:59.57]I don't have any.
[08:00.37]So I've been like literally sleeping and playing Hearthstone for four days.
[08:03.66]Uh, so I don't have any material.
[08:05.64]And is that another hundred bucks that just came through?
[08:07.84]No, it's the same one.
[08:09.12]Uh, Streamlabs is late.
[08:13.95]Hearthstone stream.
[08:15.28]No, I'm not good.
[08:16.26]I make mistakes.
[08:17.21]I make tons of fucking mistakes.
[08:20.42]I've been playing the new, uh, Dalaran expansion, and I make... I fuck up so much, but the best part about playing those single-player campaigns is... Okay, I'm gonna give you an opinion here.
[08:31.31]This is just my opinion.
[08:33.31]If you don't... I'm sorry if you don't like it, if you think I'm wrong or stupid.
[08:36.27]That's... You're completely able to say that.
[08:39.13]Hearthstone has kind of turned into, like, this clown show, where they've added so many crazy things to this game.
[08:45.27]Oh, Echo!
[08:45.83]He's played the same card seven times!
[08:50.85]Last time I played it, it wasn't like that, and I'm just like, what the fuck is going on here?
[08:54.77]There's like clown, yeah, there's clown cards in the game now.
[08:57.67]Oh, cast a random spell at a random person, target selected randomly!
[09:02.48]So, when I play that game against other people, I have no idea what I'm doing, and it's just like, embarrassing and frustrating.
[09:09.46]When I play against a computer, I get to use all the new, cool, fun, ridiculous, randomized clown cards, and beat the computer.
[09:15.83]And it's fun.
[09:23.03]I don't buy card packs, no.
[09:24.13]I just play the solo adventures and they come up.
[09:25.99]That's how I play most games, to be honest.
[09:29.11]Yeah.
[09:32.02]Solitaire mindset, yeah.
[09:36.48]Yeah, it is very, okay, I can talk like shit about, like, all these new ridiculous cards that I don't understand, that throw the game upside down for me, but I have absolutely put into that Dalaran expansion, absolutely, I mean, this is not even, I'm not even kidding, this is some kind of currency thing, I've put probably 50 hours into it in the last seven days.
[09:58.57]Had to have.
[10:01.88]Anyways, uh, today, I've been, like, away for, like, four days, so I'm just trying to, we're trying to get, like, a state of the channel address here.
[10:11.57]Heroic mode?
[10:12.13]I can't do heroic mode, I'm too bad.
[10:14.91]Because I get fucking mad, and I, like, fucking grab my iPad, and I'm just like, the fuck, and I, like, scream into the iPad like it's hearing me.
[10:23.52]I can't do it, I have to, like, okay, you know when you... have like your grandfather play a game or like your mother or something or like a friend of yours that doesn't play games?
[10:33.00]And before they get to touch it you turn the difficulty down to like zero because you just want them to have fun? I feel like that's what has to happen to me.
[10:42.00]I have to like be given an experience that I look at.
[10:44.00]I'm like wow this is hard and crazy! But it's on like zero.
[10:48.00]And I get to go: Oh I just- see what I just did there? I like in my mind I calculated like lethal-
[10:54.00]I'm on like the easiest difficulty. I just feel good, you know?
[11:00.33]My whole family are god gamers.
[11:01.87]He's a child.
[11:04.63]Hey, look at that!
[11:05.41]You probably... What's the name of the stream?
[11:09.49]A very childlike.
[11:10.34]Yeah, you have to give me something.
[11:11.70]You have to give me, like, food and tell me it's other food and make me believe you and tell me it's like Captain Crunch but it's actually broccoli.
[11:20.48]And I have to believe you.
[11:23.85]What?
[11:24.23]I don't want that.
[11:25.55]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[11:26.71]Jeremy, that's Captain Crunch broccoli.
[11:29.21]What?
[11:29.56]Is it?
[11:29.96]Yeah.
[11:30.84]Yeah, that's not regular broccoli.
[11:32.12]That's Captain Crunch broccoli.
[11:34.04]Oh, that means I like it.
[11:40.63]Well, it's just a power of suggestion.
[11:42.41]You know that if you hand somebody... I've been away for four days, so you've got to let me get this out.
[11:47.66]You know if you hand somebody various liquids that are just water with orange, red, or blue food coloring in it, and you tell them that the orange one is orange tropical punch flavored, a certain percentage of people will taste it.
[12:02.85]I don't know.
[12:08.01]I was in that study.
[12:10.74]He's on a tangent.
[12:11.66]I can tell you, I gotta get this.
[12:12.94]You gotta let me get it out.
[12:14.37]I haven't been here for four days.
[12:16.65]But, okay, I was gonna break down what we were gonna do.
[12:19.25]Anyways, colonoscopy, good.
[12:21.93]Everything's fine.
[12:22.89]I'm good to go.
[12:24.32]Sorry I was away for a few days here.
[12:27.36]But, you know, I'm trying to take care of myself.
[12:29.96]Today, tomorrow, and Thursday, three days in a row,
[12:33.34]Sam and Max and maybe Heroes of Might and Magic clean up, just chill while I get back to normal.
[12:38.37]Tomorrow, Cooking... I'm talking like the stream's over, it's not.
[12:42.25]Tomorrow, Cooking Simulator.
[12:43.61]Been waiting for that game for a long fucking time.
[12:45.85]They delayed that game like seven times.
[12:48.05]And every time it was like a week away, I was ready to stream it, they pushed it like another six months.
[12:53.21]So, Cooking Simulator tomorrow.
[12:55.65]Thursday, if Cooking Simulator is a lot of fun, maybe I'll do it again.
[12:59.30]Bingo.
[13:00.40]Fast forward.
[13:01.28]E3.
[13:01.64]E3.
[13:01.78]I'm going to do professional E3 breakdown streams for all the major conferences like we did last year.
[13:12.66]So that's what, three days?
[13:13.73]That's what, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday?
[13:18.11]And then, excuse me, hold on a second here.
[13:20.91]What's that?
[13:21.21]You got something else planned.
[13:22.13]What do you think I've been doing?
[13:23.01]I've been playing Hearthstone and planning streams.
[13:25.21]I've been lying in bed, calculating lethal, and then what am I going to do next week?
[13:30.00]I'll show it to you right now.
[13:31.38]I got this.
[13:32.82]Wait, how do I look?
[13:33.82]It doesn't matter.
[13:34.34]Who cares?
[13:34.70]I just had a colonoscopy, goddammit.
[13:36.38]Let me look like shit.
[13:38.20]I got this.
[13:40.84]You don't need to see me.
[13:43.60]We're going to play this.
[13:46.70]This is a card game called Unlock, where you have to escape from the scary carnival.
[13:52.31]You have an app that you load up on your phone, or on your iPad or whatever, whatever, doesn't matter.
[14:01.37]And you have to escape from, like, the circus.
[14:05.93]I have three of them.
[14:09.30]They're like mini little hour to two hour long board games.
[14:13.36]I have three of them.
[14:15.13]I've got Escape from the Dinosaurs, Escape from the Clowns, and then the Wild West.
[14:22.71]We're doing that after E3.
[14:25.69]I'm glad we could have this conversation.
[14:28.03]Hey, I'm glad to be back.
[14:30.08]Let's start.
[14:31.64]Sam and Max, we're going to clean up some stuff.
[14:34.12]Sam and Max, last episode of Season 2, that only took me 14 minutes.
[14:39.90]That's it.
[14:40.86]Check your watch.
[14:42.38]Welcome, guys.
[14:43.92]Here we go.
[15:18.02]I was just making sure you were ready.
[15:19.04]Some people may have been in the bathroom.
[15:23.14]Loud.
[15:26.78]This is called... Ooh.
[15:29.62]It's not what that's called.
[15:32.73]Spaceship will self-destruct in three, two, one.
[15:38.59]Spaceship destroyed.
[15:40.79]But I've still got the greatest enthusiasm and confidence in the mission.
[15:44.99]Looks like we escaped that horrible explosion.
[15:47.89]In the nick of time.
[15:49.31]You okay, Max?
[15:50.95]I don't feel disintegrated.
[15:53.16]You?
[15:53.68]No more than usual.
[15:54.96]But it felt like landing on a boiled ham.
[15:57.08]Oops.
[15:58.08]Sorry, Mr. Featherly.
[15:58.98]I forgot you were in there.
[16:00.52]Dude, these are the only characters that get to stick around.
[16:02.90]Why on Earth have you brought me here?
[16:05.08]Do you recognize this place?
[16:06.84]Does no one study the classics anymore?
[16:11.95]Well, we're obviously in the eternal twilight at the banks of the River Styx.
[16:17.10]The land of the dead.
[16:18.70]The land of the dead.
[16:20.50]Oh boy!
[16:20.86]All the coolest people are dead.
[16:22.98]I should have brought my autograph book.
[16:24.89]Well, you've delivered Bosco to his final rest, so let's be off, shall we?
[16:29.49]Come on, we can't just leave Bosco here.
[16:31.89]Yeah, we should at least staple a note to him or something.
[16:35.85]No, we're gonna have to find Bosco's soul and get it back into his body.
[16:38.88]Find Bosco's soul.
[16:40.28]I knew the peace and quiet was too good to last.
[16:42.82]Final episode of season two, episode five.
[16:47.24]It's titled... Beezlebub.
[16:51.26]I don't know, something like that.
[16:52.24]Anyways, what are these moles doing here?
[16:55.94]Do I have any items from the last adventure?
[16:57.36]So I have an egg.
[17:01.37]We have the cake sample.
[17:02.19]By the way, if you missed last time that I played this, there were aliens, and we got sucked into a spaceship, and then we got sucked into this wormhole, and now we're all dead.
[17:12.89]I think.
[17:13.17]I don't know.
[17:13.71]I didn't read the manga.
[17:16.42]The AI isn't useful on creatures with natural intelligence.
[17:20.40]Okay, so we gotta get Bosco's soul.
[17:22.72]Poor Bosco.
[17:23.80]The shock of seeing time-traveling mariachis was too much for his heart to take.
[17:27.74]Stress-induced heart attacks are the second most common cause of death for conspiracy freaks obsessed with alien abduction.
[17:33.22]What's the first?
[17:34.52]Unexplained organ removal.
[17:36.76]Well, this moment... Hold on.
[17:37.84]This is... I need to, like, bring this up.
[17:41.64]This, like, cut off a little bit for me.
[17:44.82]I can't stream under these conditions.
[17:48.08]I'll see you next week, guys.
[17:49.86]Maybe, like, I don't know, a couple months.
[17:51.46]Once I, like, get over it.
[17:53.03]This is what happens to babies that get thrown out with the bathwater.
[17:57.27]Bye.
[17:57.57]Okay, so, let's talk to Featherloo.
[18:00.83]All those times on the Mariachi spaceship when you saw only one set of footprints?
[18:05.09]That was when I carried you.
[18:06.81]Oh, for heaven's sake!
[18:11.95]Alright.
[18:12.49]Can I run for rent?
[18:14.35]Bookstore game cartridges.
[18:16.23]What the hell is this?
[18:17.85]Is this E.T.?
[18:18.31]It's E.T.?
[18:18.63]Ah, it's like it was actually in the desert in Nevada.
[18:21.20]I actually think that's true.
[18:22.92]Harry!
[18:23.08]Karaoke machine and gumball machine.
[18:25.86]Oh, it's the gumball machine!
[18:41.18]from upstairs ball machine we've been missing oh I wouldn't say we've been missing it let's talk to Harry oh cute max it's a little goth mole man token dig stream so now we're under representing the mole man demographic I thought we were just insensitive to women and minorities no you need a token you've ruined my big entrance wait
[19:10.78]Okay.
[19:18.69]Let us on the train.
[19:19.53]What are you doing here?
[19:20.43]Where's Bosco's soul?
[19:21.33]Hmm.
[19:21.43]Bosco.
[19:28.42]Just do two palms up.
[19:34.77]Center of left shoulder, center of right shoulder.
[19:40.43]Two palms up, center of left shoulder, center of right shoulder.
[19:43.29]Push as hard as you fucking can, lunging forward into the acid.
[19:49.27]Right here.
[19:52.51]Guaranteed to fall over.
[19:57.37]What do you mean, what?
[20:03.43]What?
[20:03.59]What?
[20:03.69]What's wrong?
[20:04.92]I mean, there's something wrong with that, but... Are you still sedated?
[20:11.33]Oh, hold on!
[20:12.25]Hold on, I got like a funny story.
[20:14.80]I got a funny, oh, he was sedated story.
[20:17.06]Well, not really.
[20:17.86]I was like really polite and really nice.
[20:21.64]But, so Etalyx picked me up.
[20:23.84]Because you have to have somebody drive you there.
[20:27.88]You can't drive.
[20:28.84]Because obviously, for very obvious reasons.
[20:31.18]So when he came to get me into the, you know, the recovery room...
[20:35.39]He overheard, I mean, I remember this, but I kind of don't, but he overheard me talking to the nurses.
[20:43.45]And I was saying some strange things, not really that strange, but apparently I got up and was putting on my shoes and falling down.
[20:52.90]And like falling forward and almost like hitting my head on the wall, putting my shoes on.
[20:56.26]And the nurse was like, hey, hey, sit down, sit down.
[20:58.98]And apparently I looked at her and I went, hey, don't worry, this ain't my first rodeo.
[21:04.94]I don't know, like, as in... As in what?
[21:08.34]Like, as in... I do drugs all the time?
[21:10.38]I was like, no, don't worry.
[21:12.60]This ain't my first rodeo.
[21:13.72]I got this.
[21:14.80]And then I, like, announced to everybody.
[21:16.64]I said, like, five times.
[21:18.22]I was supposed to say, you guys are pros.
[21:20.76]You guys are pros.
[21:22.41]All of you.
[21:22.99]Thank you, all of you.
[21:23.79]You're all pros.
[21:24.99]Tell the doctor that he's a pro.
[21:27.76]And they're like, yeah, yeah, we will thank you.
[21:29.34]And all I remember is, like, there's, like, Etalyx holding my arm and, like, walking with me, like, step by step.
[21:35.75]And I'm just like, tell everybody in the office that they're pros.
[21:42.90]And then we were driving on, like, the road, it just... I felt like we were... I didn't... I didn't actually feel like this.
[21:49.78]But I said, like, oh, cool, we're, like, going through space.
[21:52.49]Because the lines on the road going down... I knew we were on a road.
[21:56.35]I wasn't, like, stupid.
[21:59.61]It was the lines on the road.
[22:00.61]You know, like, Star Wars, and they go to hyperspace, and, like, the... The lines come forward?
[22:05.89]I wasn't... I didn't actually believe that.
[22:07.29]I was just drugged up saying words.
[22:09.45]Anyways, there's the funny... Look what happened to me when I was on Drugstore.
[22:16.07]How do we get to Hell?
[22:17.05]Well, you have to take the Soul Train, naturally.
[22:19.91]Your final stop depends on what's in your permanent record.
[22:23.21]But if you two are trying to get to Hell, that really shouldn't be a problem.
[22:35.24]Can you imagine if I had gone forward to put my shoes on?
[22:39.55]I went like this.
[22:39.99]You know when you... You're going to laugh at me, but I don't care.
[22:43.33]So, you know when you put your shoes on and you lean forward to pull the latch up over your heel?
[22:49.69]When I was doing that, I pulled too much and started to go forward.
[22:52.65]Imagine if I just kept going forward and smashed my head through the drywall.
[23:02.66]It's not a choker.
[23:03.66]It's the ripped shirt.
[23:04.40]I like this shirt.
[23:05.46]It's a very sentimental value shirt.
[23:07.13]What's that hair?
[23:09.03]It's just... Look, I'm in recovery, okay?
[23:13.39]We want to take the next train out of here.
[23:15.17]Nobody gets on board the Soul Train without... Don't get me too hot right now.
[23:19.11]I'm not supposed to get stressed.
[23:20.49]You automatically get one when you die at your appointed time.
[23:25.54]Cheer up, fellas.
[23:27.12]You'll be dead soon enough.
[23:35.81]Okay, I really, like, probably shouldn't be laughing.
[23:38.33]No more, like, funny things.
[23:39.97]Don't say anything funny, because, like, I really think I'm supposed to, like, take it easy down here.
[23:44.73]So, I'm not gonna make any more... I'm not gonna laugh at anything, and no one in the chat's gonna make any funny things.
[23:51.32]Okay, let me be serious.
[23:53.24]How do we get a token again?
[23:54.90]You automatically get one when you die.
[23:57.31]Okay, so we have to die.
[23:58.01]But it has to be your time.
[24:00.19]So don't try jumping the turnstiles with any murder-suicide patterns.
[24:04.83]Nuts.
[24:05.65]Jesus.
[24:06.88]Okay.
[24:08.52]See you later, Harry.
[24:09.96]Maybe sooner than you think.
[24:11.70]So we have to die.
[24:14.83]Hey, it's a Mr. Reaper phone.
[24:16.89]Hey, good looking.
[24:17.97]I'll be back to cut you down later.
[24:20.33]Are you allowed to get angry?
[24:21.29]No, no, no.
[24:21.85]No emotions.
[24:22.45]I have to be, like, emotionless.
[24:23.77]Why do you think I've been playing Hearthstone?
[24:26.37]Because that's emotionless.
[24:27.81]I just sit there with my fucking eyes wide open, just staring.
[24:32.71]And I hear the guy go like, Uther versus... Carl Drogo!
[24:39.00]I don't even need to think.
[24:40.06]It doesn't matter.
[24:48.27]There's so many people in that game now.
[24:50.05]Did somebody just give community subs?
[24:54.49]Dermal lied about the clown car.
[24:55.95]Thanks for the five community subs.
[24:57.33]Thank you for the five subs.
[24:58.90]So they're just right above hell.
[25:00.32]It's just in the sewer.
[25:15.69]Okay, well, wait.
[25:17.15]What?
[25:17.45]Mama Bosco's ghost?
[25:19.25]Mrs. Mama Bosco?
[25:20.95]That's Ms.
[25:22.26]Mama Bosco.
[25:23.84]You think just because I'm dead, you don't have to respect my independence?
[25:27.08]How'd you get to be a ghost?
[25:28.32]Disable pop-up notifications.
[25:30.78]It doesn't matter.
[25:31.58]My Steam is broken, guys.
[25:33.88]You understand?
[25:34.45]I don't remember hearing or causing an explosion.
[25:37.83]It was a great big geyser of vinegar and baking soda.
[25:42.44]Let me give you a quick little story.
[25:43.84]I disabled my Steam notifications like seven years ago.
[25:49.88]I've done everything.
[25:50.82]I've turned off everything.
[25:51.94]It doesn't matter.
[25:52.44]I have so many broken notifications for like the 5,000 invites that I've gotten over the last like almost decade.
[26:00.82]I can't turn them off.
[26:07.33]But I think I can do this though.
[26:10.47]God damn it.
[26:11.13]What the fuck?
[26:15.42]I'm not even logged into Steam.
[26:22.46]I'm not even fucking logged in.
[26:23.86]I am not even logged into Steam.
[26:29.98]I'm not like on my friends.
[26:32.15]I'm disconnected right now.
[26:38.45]Like disconnected as in I'm still on my Steam library, like in my store, but I'm not... Why am I getting notifications?
[26:49.78]I'm not supposed to.
[26:50.30]I'm supposed to stay low stress.
[26:58.08]It's the Tuesday maintenance.
[27:03.14]God damn it, man.
[27:06.25]No, that's the wrong button.
[27:10.97]Why is that showing up?
[27:14.49]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[27:16.79]What?
[27:17.97]I gotta get, I gotta, hold on.
[27:20.37]If I just exit out of Steam, I'm gonna be able to stay in Salmon Max, right?
[27:27.47]Like, if I just physically exit Steam.
[27:31.61]That's not gonna kick me out, right?
[27:39.04]Stop shouting, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[27:40.90]Will it kick me out?
[27:41.70]What the fuck?
[27:44.37]Why am I getting notifications when I'm not even logged into Steam?
[27:52.33]Oh, stress levels are getting fucking high.
[27:53.93]Hold on.
[27:54.25]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[27:56.39]Let me save this.
[27:58.45]All my fucking notifications are off.
[28:01.55]Steam, why can't you just let me never have them?
[28:05.28]Oh.
[28:11.46]Okay, I'm gonna... Let me just exit Steam.
[28:15.31]God damn it, it is exiting Sam and Max.
[28:19.85]Fucking technology, man.
[28:23.79]I saved it, though.
[28:26.69]Alright, so somebody explain to me again why, while I'm not even logged into friends or signed into steams, like friends and chat, that I'm still getting fucking notifications?
[28:35.67]What is that?
[28:36.80]Why is that happening?
[28:44.87]I can't do game capture.
[28:46.13]You cannot game capture this game.
[28:49.83]I'm in offline mode.
[28:51.51]I'm not online.
[29:01.33]Why would I be getting notifications?
[29:09.15]Whatever.
[29:10.03]We'll try it again.
[29:16.86]Uh, thank you Skelator for the five community subs.
[29:22.34]Should've gotten the GOG version.
[29:24.20]You know what else is really dumb?
[29:30.10]Did you guys know that you cannot delete a Steam group?
[29:38.23]You can't delete a Steam group.
[29:41.01]It has to get to zero members.
[29:46.08]If your Steam group does not have zero members, it cannot be deleted.
[29:53.95]Why?
[29:57.23]And why am I getting...
[29:59.90]I'm gonna scream here, but just pretend I'm screaming.
[30:02.31]Notifications when I'm not even fucking logged into Steam.
[30:06.19]And when I'm not even fucking connected to the friend's account.
[30:09.51]I'm offline mode.
[30:11.29]And I've had notifications turned off for ten fucking years.
[30:14.87]Why are you still showing me notifications?
[30:18.39]I don't want any notifications.
[30:19.81]I'm going really low here.
[30:20.69]Okay, let's do this back.
[30:21.51]Okay, I'm fine, I'm fine.
[30:27.78]Okay.
[30:29.15]Back to what we were doing.
[30:33.15]Put something over on the bottom right.
[30:35.09]Yeah.
[30:35.73]I'm going to put like Steam sucks down there.
[31:07.43]No, it's gotta be like a square.
[31:11.33]I'm just gonna make a black square.
[31:12.99]No, who cares, alright?
[31:14.43]Here we go.
[31:19.07]How do we get to your apartment?
[31:20.63]Hell if I know.
[31:21.69]Some fool blew up the stairs.
[31:26.23]Somebody blew up the stairs.
[31:28.39]How do we get to your apartment?
[31:29.97]Hell if I know.
[31:31.01]Some fool blew up the stairs.
[31:33.72]Okay, how do we get up there?
[31:34.56]Okay.
[31:34.68]Someone blew up the stairs.
[31:35.40]That was Jerva last year when he was talking about cryptocurrency.
[31:39.94]Get on the crypto train!
[32:00.77]Okay, say it again.
[32:01.67]Did you get a token for the afterlife?
[32:03.71]I told you, it's still up in my apartment.
[32:05.82]Okay, so we have to get up to Mama Bosco's apartment.
[32:09.76]Sorry for your loss.
[32:11.20]Any final arrangements you want us to take care of?
[32:13.48]Oh, I ain't going anywhere yet.
[32:15.79]Even if I could get to the afterlife, I can't rest until I find the man who trashed my store.
[32:21.23]That was over 40 years ago.
[32:24.07]Wow, she really holds a grudge.
[32:26.56]I'm glad I broke up with her.
[32:28.26]I spent the last 40 years thinking up new ways to make his life a living hell.
[32:32.74]But then she says things like that, which makes me love her even more.
[32:38.20]Alright, we've got to get that token.
[32:40.26]And I also have to fix this, because this is going to drive me crazy for the rest of the stream.
[32:43.32]I know some of you are already being driven crazy.
[32:46.12]Here we go.
[32:47.97]The black bar is gone.
[32:51.01]Look, I'm hearing your feedback, and I'm putting your feedback into place.
[32:55.79]Anytime somebody says a piece of feedback, I always hear it.
[32:59.63]Alright, can we go in here?
[33:02.86]Hiya, Flint.
[33:03.64]What's shakin'?
[33:04.26]What the fu- Can't talk, fellas.
[33:05.38]I'm still waiting for Bosco to get back.
[33:07.68]Oh, we already found Bosco.
[33:09.58]Yeah, his corpse is already decaying down in the sewer.
[33:12.44]Heh, that's cute, little pals.
[33:14.15]But I got a 40-year-old case to wrap up here.
[33:17.79]Okay.
[33:21.69]Alright, we gotta go look and crack?
[33:22.91]Ooh, it's getting hot down there.
[33:25.47]So that's where the Esperanto bookstore went.
[33:28.42]He doesn't know.
[33:29.36]What do I not know?
[33:35.68]Don't freak me out.
[33:36.40]My stress levels.
[33:37.32]It's a rock.
[33:40.58]It's a rock.
[33:42.98]Maintron 9000.
[33:43.80]Alright, can we finally do something with this?
[33:46.30]Spent the whole season looking at it.
[33:48.77]Yeah?
[33:49.53]Well, I got an image to maintain.
[33:51.55]Can't be seen with you, lowlifes.
[33:54.02]Something about this is really sad.
[33:55.04]This is really sad.
[33:55.42]Oh, casino?
[34:24.21]I thought that said The Lucky Vegan.
[34:25.73]I was like, why is that the name of your casino?
[34:36.13]Stop letting your emotions get to you, Jeremy.
[34:37.81]They make you weak.
[34:38.83]Weak them up.
[34:39.53]What like a Sith thing to say?
[34:51.27]What like a nice evil corporation way to see things.
[34:55.28]Alright, we gotta get up to that apartment.
[34:58.38]Let's go into symbols.
[35:04.60]That's a Jedi thing.
[35:07.37]No, Jedi is... a balance of the force, right?
[35:12.50]Sith is absolutes.
[35:13.62]Oh, Sam and Max, you're here.
[35:15.77]I've been dying to tell you.
[35:18.11]You'll never guess what Abe did during our date last night.
[35:22.15]We stopped speculating about that months ago.
[35:24.28]It was making me lose my appetite.
[35:26.88]Sam, shut it.
[35:28.34]Girlfriend, dish.
[35:30.52]That's a Jedi thing.
[35:31.06]He actually got down on one jowl and asked me to marry him.
[35:34.98]Congrats, I guess.
[35:36.34]I've got so much planning to do.
[35:38.48]I'd be a wreck if I didn't have the monster to help.
[35:41.41]Oh, it's no bother.
[35:44.29]So wait, Sith is about emotions and being in touch with your emotions and Jedi about locking and blocking your emotions out.
[35:55.62]What the fuck?
[36:04.12]Yeah, yeah.
[36:05.94]Huh.
[36:08.82]Well, that's why, like, you need a balance in the forest.
[36:14.20]How you doing, gruesome?
[36:15.48]What have you been doing since you confessed your love for Sybil and she turned you down?
[36:19.42]Mostly just replaying that moment in my mind over and over again.
[36:26.00]Hey, monster, which color do you think Abe would look best in?
[36:29.46]Stop.
[36:30.98]Maroon.
[36:37.06]I have so much Star Wars merchandise.
[36:39.40]But here's the thing.
[36:40.26]Listen, guys.
[36:42.10]Most of the Star Wars merchandise that I have was like random Christmas gifts.
[36:48.31]Okay?
[36:49.95]It was like Christmas presents.
[36:53.05]Oh look, the new Star Wars is coming out.
[36:55.17]Here's five t-shirts.
[36:56.87]It's like, okay, I guess.
[36:58.65]And they're comfortable.
[37:02.43]A lot of them are Christmas.
[37:03.47]I have like 30 Star Wars t-shirts.
[37:06.11]Not because I think Star Wars is the best thing I've ever seen.
[37:08.39]It's because, you know, like Trekkies to infinity and beyond, right?
[37:13.24]I'm a Trekkie.
[37:14.24]I don't like Star Wars.
[37:16.42]But because I get them as gifts.
[37:20.88]Hiya, Sybil.
[37:21.92]I don't have much time to chat, Sam.
[37:23.93]I've got so much to plan.
[37:27.42]let's be in the wedding is there room in the wedding party for max and me as president of the u.s and high priest of the ocean chimps I'm qualified both legally and spiritually to conduct the ceremony how to put this tactfully they'll be serving ice cream in hell before they do serve ice cream in hell oh come on vanilla's my favorite like he you had a perfect opportunity for a hysterical joke I'm I'm able to consult by the way

[38:00.29]What a thing to ask.
[38:02.01]Oh, wait.
[38:03.01]He doesn't know what that means, does he?
[38:05.02]Just let him enjoy his fantasy version for a while.
[38:12.60]Why is he here?
[38:13.54]We just left him here and she left him here?
[38:14.99]He doesn't know.
[38:15.43]Stop this!
[38:15.65]I'm getting really emotional.
[38:16.89]You're fucking with my Sith mentality.
[38:18.79]Okay, well that's bad.
[38:39.33]Did we accidentally leave our monster in here?
[38:41.31]Okay, so... That's fine.
[38:42.41]Uh, wedding stuff.
[38:45.19]I know what that's like.
[38:46.97]I know what that's like.
[38:49.66]Okay.
[39:10.73]Uh, cake in the mail.
[39:11.59]Let me hear this one more time.
[39:16.23]It's so fucking horrible.
[39:18.49]Alright, uh, let's go out the exit.
[39:21.83]It's not- What?
[39:23.72]Oh, I'm gonna do that.
[39:26.56]Why?
[39:28.36]Over, like, twelve- eight episodes.
[39:32.10]Nine episodes.
[39:32.78]You're gonna do that to me?
[39:36.07]Okay.
[39:37.47]Anything else I can do?
[39:38.37]What about the fox?
[39:39.95]Sure.
[39:40.31]They talk about personality.
[39:42.01]But Miss America always goes to the fox.
[39:45.46]God.
[39:45.80]Alright, we have egg.
[39:50.24]Gun.
[39:51.22]Let's just... I want to go check out Stinkies.
[39:58.82]Can I drive anywhere?
[40:00.16]Hold on.
[40:00.62]One thing at a time.
[40:03.18]Hmm.
[40:03.58]They're closed.
[40:04.68]Closed.
[40:08.05]How are these guys doing?
[40:08.99]Okay, um... Got any car upgrades?
[40:10.69]Funny car.
[40:25.49]Offer end Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.
[40:28.63]I like funny things.
[40:29.30]Oh, yeah!
[40:30.14]I can take that mother out of the street away, push her to the red line till she screams, pop the clutch, kick you the afterburners, and smoke them pigs as I sail over the county line.
[40:40.17]Woo!
[40:41.69]You can't see over the wheel, Max.
[40:43.71]Fascist.
[40:46.93]Hey, Jeremy lied about the clown car.
[40:48.41]What a perfect opportunity for you to come in here.
[40:51.07]Thanks to the five community subs.
[40:53.15]Five more.
[40:53.59]You gave more earlier, too.
[40:55.97]Thank you so much.
[40:58.43]Thank you.
[41:00.80]What's wrong with the bluster?
[41:03.26]He suffered severe injuries while testing an experimental wireless antenna.
[41:10.56]You guys, you guys, I'm in so much pain right now.
[41:15.99]We have been using laughing gas to keep him sedated.
[41:19.29]I know what that's like, too.
[41:21.29]Except not laughing gas.
[41:22.79]Somebody says, how do I get a sub?
[41:24.41]Now, how do I get one?
[41:27.19]Well, you either wait till one of somebody in the community graciously sends a community subs, or it's $5.99.
[41:35.02]That's not right.
[41:36.46]It's $4.99.
[41:37.04]I'm adding a dollar for no reason.
[41:38.58]When was the last time I looked at that?
[41:41.92]$5.99 for a sub.
[41:43.12]It's actually $4.99.
[41:47.75]I'm like scamming.
[41:49.78]I have my own button down there.
[41:51.28]That would be so fucked up.
[41:58.28]What's up?
[41:59.42]It's $5.99.
[42:01.34]We want that nitrous upgrade for our car.

[43:07.01]And these guys are the only ones not going to hell.
[43:10.21]They're selling the rest of his prescription.
[43:12.61]What the fuck?
[43:13.69]So long, cops.
[43:14.97]Stay virtuous.
[43:18.29]Somebody just subscribed to Twitchfront.
[43:19.49]Thank you, Twitchfront.
[43:24.54]Okay, so... We need to...
[43:30.69]I think I can do better than that.
[43:32.77]I can do better, like, streamer voice.
[43:35.17]Hey, thanks for that, Twitch Prime!
[43:39.25]No, hey, thanks!
[43:41.89]Hey, thanks for that, Twitch Prime, man.
[43:44.39]Really appreciate it.
[43:45.63]That was better.
[43:46.10]I had to turn the volume down.
[43:47.04]Didn't want to hurt anybody.
[43:47.82]Alright, let's go!
[43:52.24]How the fuck do I get... I need to, like, go to her apartment.
[44:03.16]We can't get up there.
[44:04.46]And where is her apartment?
[44:06.08]The thing's blocking the way.
[44:11.22]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[44:13.32]Ow, my stomach.
[44:20.29]Hey.
[44:22.69]Hey, buddy.
[44:23.93]Throw us that remote control, would you?
[44:28.45]You're gonna need this.
[44:29.51]Wow.
[44:30.93]Thanks, buddy.
[44:31.85]Be you later.
[44:32.81]What a perfect time loop.
[44:34.73]What a perfect time loop.
[44:37.73]So we have the remote control, the Boxing Betty remote.
[44:41.30]Where's Boxing Betty?
[44:47.98]Wasn't Boxing Betty... Where was Boxing Betty?
[44:51.22]In my closet?
[44:53.59]I can't get up to the closet, though.
[44:56.11]Oh, right, right, over here, over here.
[45:01.00]Nobody gonna come in here.
[45:02.44]I don't need to come in there.
[45:03.64]I'm just gonna control from outside here.
[45:04.72]Come on.
[45:05.44]It's not gonna... Nah.
[45:21.39]The remote won't do much good while he's dead.
[45:23.17]He's dead.
[45:26.07]Dammit.
[45:28.25]Uh, what else could I control?
[45:31.46]Is there any electronic device?
[45:32.74]Maybe, can I go in here?
[45:33.94]Will he, like, let me in here now?
[45:34.90]Maybe down in the sewer.
[45:37.19]Uh, is there something I can... Let me check down here.
[46:02.48]Can I talk to this person?
[46:06.00]No, that means you're fucking stacked!
[46:16.73]When I was working out, and I started to wear tight fucking extra-small shirts, just, almost like if I moved the wrong way, I would just pop out of them.
[46:27.65]People would say, man, you're really filling out shirts now, and I'd be like, yeah.
[46:31.61]But why does the shirt only come down to your belly button?
[46:35.03]Oh, it's just, you know, it's a new style.
[46:39.62]Okay, so... What about the karaoke machine?
[46:45.92]Gumball machine?
[46:48.74]Video games?
[46:53.43]Can I control the video games?
[46:55.25]Bosco.
[46:57.87]No.
[47:01.24]The train?
[47:01.92]Fuck, what do I do with this?
[47:03.32]I'm so close.
[47:05.74]We've got to get Bosco's soul back.
[47:08.00]I know, I know.
[47:08.79]I'm trying.
[47:09.21]What's the map say?
[47:10.33]Why can't every belief system have a transit system this efficient?
[47:17.37]The ego on this guy.
[47:24.20]Guys, the only ego that I like has another G.
[47:30.03]And... Toasts up in a minute, and you put butter and a little bit of cinnamon on it, and it's great for breakfast.
[47:37.38]I know that that was probably the worst thing you've heard in, like, probably the last six months.
[47:40.40]It was terrible.
[47:41.84]But I don't care.
[47:43.22]If you saw that joke on, like, fucking ABC this morning, like, your parents would have laughed.
[47:48.04]And that's... All it matters is a laugh.
[47:50.44]Doesn't matter where it comes from.
[47:55.41]What about on you?
[47:56.35]Can I control one of these guys?
[48:00.69]No way.
[48:01.65]I can't, like, do anything with this.
[48:07.26]Not even your parents would have laughed.
[48:08.32]I guarantee they would have.
[48:09.74]If I call my grandmother right now and I make that same joke, she'll go, Oh, yeah.
[48:15.31]Those are delicious, yeah.
[48:21.94]Guys, do you know how... Never mind.
[48:25.59]This is a thing.
[48:27.57]No, I can't talk about this.
[48:29.39]I'm not going to talk about this, because this is like... a thing that I've wanted to do for a very long time, and I haven't done it yet.
[48:40.49]No, I can't, because in case I do it, it has to be done right.
[48:43.27]Then no one can know about it.
[48:45.25]What about Sybil's office?
[48:48.12]The car?
[49:01.93]Nothing in here I can do.
[49:03.15]Well, no, have they left at this point?
[49:06.86]Wait a minute.
[49:10.34]So when you throw the egg, yeah, yeah, okay, I, I, I know, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[49:18.28]Because blocking the door...
[49:28.44]What are you doing?
[49:30.22]Somebody's blocking our office door from the inside.
[49:32.55]No, I just gave him the egg.
[49:34.45]Don't they leave?
[49:35.57]I don't want to bother ourselves.
[49:38.61]Fuck.
[49:43.79]AI?
[49:45.25]Tar?
[49:50.37]Can I give this to them?
[49:57.57]That doesn't need a new AI.
[50:03.91]Oh, wait.
[50:05.95]I know it needs a new brain.
[50:07.37]Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[50:18.43]What's that?
[50:19.59]It's all neat and computery.
[50:21.19]It's got to help out with your laser light show.
[50:23.69]Thanks, Sam and Max.
[50:25.45]This will be playful.
[50:27.34]He's reading chat.
[50:28.96]You can never prove that.
[50:30.44]Evacuate!
[50:31.14]Evacuate!
[50:51.83]Did you just kill that rat?
[50:54.35]Hello!
[50:54.81]For emergency medical service, press or say one now.
[51:14.68]How many other people were inside?
[51:19.00]That just got turned upside down.
[51:20.90]There's like, probably, there's like 30 dead rats in here.
[51:24.14]He stood up and they were all like playing cards and stuff and it just tipped upside down.
[51:27.50]Like, somebody's head got crushed with like a desk right here.
[51:31.10]Think about that.
[51:33.24]There's like four or five people at that blackjack table.
[51:35.26]When he stood up, it flipped over and like crushed him.
[51:38.36]What the fuck?
[51:41.88]Hey, robot.
[51:43.02]Greetings, morons.
[51:46.22]Dude, that's crazy.
[51:59.39]You guys are gonna put me in, like, the fucking hospital.
[52:04.97]Okay, what's with the attitude?
[52:06.23]What's with the attitude?
[52:07.72]The artificial intelligence unit you installed is refreshingly blunt, Jackass.
[52:12.20]My tax subroutines have been disabled.
[52:15.24]I don't care what I say anymore.
[52:17.19]This is my life.
[52:21.17]What?
[52:23.39]That was like perfect.
[52:28.59]Does he still not know?
[52:43.48]Let me hold on a minute.
[52:48.53]Is it this?
[52:57.09]I don't know.
[52:59.22]Now that you're mostly rat-free, what's next for you, Mr. Mame-tron?
[53:02.58]I am planning to relocate, not that it is any of your business.
[53:06.54]Are you going to make a move to a town that's right for you?
[53:09.28]Affirmative.
[53:10.08]A town to keep me
[53:15.54]Alright, we need your help.
[53:16.10]Do us a favor.
[53:17.16]I can't go for that.
[53:18.86]No can do.
[53:20.22]With my new AI, I can only be controlled remotely.
[53:23.87]I can do that.
[53:25.73]We'll talk to you later.
[53:27.05]You can call me.
[53:28.13]Call me anytime.
[53:35.85]There'll be snow flurries in hell before I let you have control of a two-story tall battle robot, Max.
[53:43.61]Here I go again on my own.
[53:47.81]Down the only open road I ever known.
[53:52.52]Right?
[53:53.24]Like a drifter I was born.
[53:54.92]I know how to do it.
[53:55.88]Alright, so I'm gonna start breaking stuff.
[54:03.12]Smash.
[54:03.78]What are we smashing?
[54:04.90]Boss goes?
[54:05.52]No, you're never gonna get it.
[54:09.74]Mama said knock you out.
[54:12.33]I'm gonna knock you out.
[54:13.74]And we'll have fun, fun, fun, now that daddy took the T-Bird away.
[54:19.59]Fun, fun, fun, now that daddy took the T-Bird away.
[54:22.79]Fun, fun, now that daddy took the... Stop getting me riled up.

[59:04.14]Jorgen.
[59:05.48]One moment.
[59:06.96]This is Hel.
[59:07.92]Danke for holding.
[59:10.00]No, Hel.
[59:12.79]What number were you trying to reach?
[59:15.23]No, they're 666.

[59:19.89]Happens all the time.
[59:21.33]See you soon.
[59:23.47]Can I help you?
[59:25.22]We want to talk to the guy in charge.
[59:27.52]He's taken Bosco's soul too early.
[59:29.72]I see.
[59:30.92]His schedule is full at the moment, but I'll see what I can do.
[59:35.68]And you are... Sam and Max.
[59:40.19]Sam and Max...
[59:43.14]The ones who killed me!
[59:44.40]Oh yes!
[59:45.50]The ones who sent me here!
[59:47.98]Or I'll get right on that.
[59:50.88]Jurgen, be a peach and clear out my calendar for... Oh dear.
[59:56.06]Who authorized this?
[59:57.71]A giant horned skull?
[60:00.29]Really?
[60:01.39]I'm sorry, I thought this was 2008.
[60:03.47]Teeth are disgusting.
[60:04.43]Oh, very well.
[60:05.63]Cancel all my appointments, would you?
[60:08.03]I'll be... in my office.
[60:11.12]Oh, did I forget to introduce you?
[60:14.66]How careless of me.
[60:16.34]You can have a seat and wait if you like.
[60:18.38]He doesn't like the skull.
[60:25.67]Somebody really needs an antacid.
[60:29.39]Stomach acid. Stomach acid. Stomach acid. Stomach acid. Stomach acid. Stomach acid. Stomach acid. Stomach acid. Stomach acid. Stomach acid. Stomach acid. Stomach acid.
[60:39.39]I wonder if that thing folds out into a bed of spikes.
[60:42.68]Okay.
[60:45.94]What are you talking about?
[60:53.68]I really shouldn't.
[60:54.24]I'm watching my weight.
[60:55.25]Don't worry!
[60:55.99]They're all nearsighted.
[60:59.21]I've lost it.
[61:00.21]I said the word stomach acid once.
[61:02.41]And then my internet, like, fucked up for a second.
[61:05.85]Did I drop frames?
[61:10.00]That's like annoying if I am.
[61:16.25]Shouldn't be.
[61:17.89]Can we get a tour?
[61:18.33]Okay.
[61:37.16]At least he has a sick gamer headset.
[61:37.96]That's like an original Xbox headset.
[61:39.38]Yeah, which is kind of missing the whole point of Hell.
[62:03.81]But the corporate presence has done wonders for our productivity.
[62:07.86]My soul-taking operation, which you destroyed.
[62:11.12]The soul-crushing undelivery system, which you destroyed.
[62:16.24]Hell is now running at peak efficiency.
[62:19.73]Or at least it was.
[62:30.55]Well, we want to talk to Satan.
[62:31.57]We want to talk to Satan.
[62:33.15]Yes.
[62:33.97]Well, I fear you just missed him.
[62:36.58]Much like you just missed saving me when you had the chance.
[62:40.50]Well, yeah, but you know, you are kind of evil.
[62:43.64]And you killed us!
[62:45.36]No matter.
[62:46.34]I will mention you are waiting next time the boss visits.
[62:49.48]He drops by every 66 years or so.
[62:55.21]Where's all the cool hell stuff?
[62:57.46]It's all the cool hell stuff.
[62:59.16]Cool hell stuff.
[63:00.40]Alright.
[63:00.80]Sick.
[63:00.96]Did we actually get to... Alright, hold on.
[63:03.42]Give me a second here.
[63:04.88]Let me save it.
[63:05.80]I haven't done a manual save in a while.
[63:08.21]No!
[63:08.31]No!
[63:33.40]No, this is autosave, does it?
[63:39.18]Right?
[63:41.24]No, it's fine.
[63:44.48]Fucking stress.
[63:45.56]I thought we were much further in.
[63:47.07]Okay, whatever, we're fine.
[63:51.35]One adult.
[63:52.29]How did we... Oh.
[63:56.71]I specifically remember the doctor said, no screaming.
[64:03.99]Skipping, we already saw this.
[64:05.41]Okay, give me... What?
[64:06.53]Why is it so close?
[64:09.33]It's like... Jeremy, I want to make sure.
[64:23.43]Alright, I'm fucking...
[64:27.55]I'm turning off all Steam.
[64:29.51]I'm disabling Steam forever.
[64:33.37]You've already seen this.
[64:34.49]Let it play out in the background.
[64:48.72]I've disabled the whole Steam overlay.
[64:51.10]Like, it's impossible for anything to pop up, right?
[64:53.51]Impossible.
[64:55.19]If the whole steamer lays off, it's impossible.
[65:07.57]Okay, we're good.
[65:08.43]Yeah, but the doctor told me.
[65:12.95]We've already seen it.
[65:13.71]I'm just going to get there.
[65:14.39]Thank God I had the autosave.
[65:15.52]Otherwise, I mean, it's just the intro.
[65:17.82]Don't worry about this.
[65:24.88]This is hell.
[65:25.89]Yeah.
[65:27.51]This is my... Okay, we got it.
[65:31.39]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[65:32.05]We received the... Okay, good morning.
[65:34.17]We found out.
[65:36.07]Okay, now we're gonna save.
[65:38.94]Hold on.
[65:47.22]Okay.
[65:48.67]Nothing happened.
[65:52.55]Now, Jeremy, I want to make sure you're very, very clear about this.
[65:56.08]The doctor did not sound anything like this.
[65:58.44]But for some reason, every single doctor needs to be like this crazy, intelligent, sage wizard type person in every piece of media.
[66:05.44]Jeez.
[66:06.70]Must be from the past.
[66:07.60]I'm not supposed to scream.
[66:14.53]George Washington.
[66:15.69]Yeah.
[66:15.89]Alright.
[66:17.27]You find me a fictional doctor.
[66:20.45]and a fictional George Washington.
[66:22.73]And I guarantee you that they both have the same voice.
[66:26.97]Fictional doctor?
[66:27.91]Fictional George Washington.
[66:30.51]And no, like George Clooney in ER doesn't count.
[66:32.84]I'm talking like, like a cartoon doctor.
[66:49.34]That's the Corporate Presence cube.
[66:51.14]This doesn't work here.
[66:56.03]Dr. Mario.
[66:56.87]That's not... No.
[66:58.17]Sorry.
[67:00.65]Dr. Mario is a costume that Mario wears.
[67:02.81]He's not a doctor.
[67:06.67]If I put a doctor's costume on, would I then be a doctor?
[67:11.47]No.
[67:12.17]It's a costume that Mario wears.
[67:13.40]Mario's a plumber.
[67:16.38]He's not a doctor.
[67:17.12]Mario's not a doctor.
[67:18.22]He's a plumber and he wore a doctor costume one time in like 1989.
[67:21.48]And had like a Tetris game.
[67:25.89]He's not a doctor.
[67:28.91]Wrath.
[67:31.23]Oh, that's funny.
[67:36.88]Coffee cup from hell.
[67:37.60]You don't have to be damned to work here, but it helps.
[67:41.54]It looks cold.
[67:42.70]I can't even get a hot cup of coffee in hell!
[67:48.85]Hey SCP.
[67:54.01]Oh, I see.
[67:56.45]SCP.
[67:58.88]Was that intentional?
[68:01.68]10 years ago, 12 years ago?
[68:02.96]It has to be.
[68:06.46]Hey buddy.
[68:08.70]Look, it's Hugh Bliss.
[68:12.38]What the fuck?
[68:13.10]Hi, I'm Hugh Bliss.
[68:17.33]Fine, don't say hi.
[68:20.99]Nice trick with your head.
[68:21.85]Nice trick with your head.
[68:23.07]Do exorcisms work on people already in hell?
[68:30.02]Just messed up.
[68:31.52]Alright, well, we missed you.
[68:32.42]You busy?
[68:33.00]We're going for lunch.
[68:33.78]Want to come?
[68:34.42]Did you get that meeting request I sent?
[68:36.06]What are your dreams?
[68:41.28]Have mercy on us.
[68:42.26]Hey, sorry about killing you last year.
[68:45.58]It happens.
[68:47.74]Uh, can we say...
[69:18.21]What about **** ****?
[69:19.25]Nope.
[69:21.39]What about **** Tugger?
[69:23.29]**** Yanker?
[69:24.97]Tool Handler?
[69:27.07]Okay, good.
[69:27.85]Good to know.
[69:29.82]You're a lousy bleeper.
[69:30.66]What about that time Jimmy Hoffa said, ride the **** surfboard?
[69:34.64]Oh yeah, you should have bleeped the **** out of that.
[69:37.52]**** is not on the list.
[69:39.22]Sorry.
[69:40.28]Tool Handler is safe.
[69:42.68]Later, Hugh Bliss.
[69:45.36]Ugh.
[69:48.43]Okay, well, let's see.
[69:49.51]We got, uh, Brady Culture.
[69:52.48]Got some good callbacks here.
[70:09.20]How did you get here?
[70:10.00]That's the announcer from You Don't Know Jack.
[70:11.86]How would you know?
[70:13.18]That's a very specific thing to know.
[70:14.76]Wow.
[70:14.86]I think it is.
[70:38.60]How'd your fro grow back so fast?
[70:40.70]Elf tears.
[70:43.14]Does your on-the-job training include evil laughsmanship?
[70:49.94]I guess that's a no.
[70:51.08]No, I can't do like an employee match on that laugh, guys.
[70:53.56]I'm sorry.
[70:54.57]I know I usually do that, but I can't.
[70:57.55]Laugh.
[71:02.52]I can do way better than that.
[71:03.62]You know I can.
[71:05.06]Somebody click clip when I did it before.
[71:07.37]I can't do that right now.
[71:08.29]I'm gonna slow down.
[71:09.75]Forgive me.
[71:10.33]My mouth is too parched for a spit tape, but...
[71:13.13]I'm not gonna do it.
[71:14.99]Do it now and rip your ass.
[71:36.00]No, I'm not going to.
[71:38.02]I can't.
[71:38.60]Dude, I screamed.
[71:41.56]Loud.
[71:42.86]And, like, I can't do that.
[71:44.83]I can't be screaming.
[71:47.17]Like, I'm telling you.
[71:47.93]Type into Google, can you scream after a colonoscopy?
[71:51.31]And some of the major results are no.

[73:45.15]Can I take that, or do I have to distract him or something?
[73:48.87]Can we have your key card?

[76:01.35]Dedicated to Sam and Max.
[76:03.49]For a lifetime of generous donations of souls, both evil and simply led astray.
[76:09.32]Somebody said, Ornstein and Smough.
[76:15.34]Hi, little Bosco.
[76:16.75]We see you in there.
[76:18.94]So what is that?
[76:23.62]This is fucked up.
[76:24.32]You're like stuck in a nightmare.
[76:26.08]It's Santa.
[76:26.52]Oh yeah, Santa is dead.
[76:46.03]I'll never get any work done with that infernal crying!
[76:51.33]Street diorama?
[76:52.67]That looks like our car.
[76:54.36]What did it do to deserve hell?
[76:56.30]I guess these days you just have to be an accomplice.
[76:58.98]Can we get in here?
[77:00.42]And take the... part of the car?
[77:05.04]It's one of Santa's elves.
[77:06.73]Oh dear, I'll never make my ship date with all these distractions.
[77:12.07]Is that Grandpa Stinky?
[77:13.94]Have we really killed this many people in this last season or two?
[77:20.90]Well, let's read the, uh, key card.

[78:13.27]Let's try the other ones.
[78:16.80]Oh, we expanded again.
[78:18.88]I thought I'd finally figured out how to keep the weight off.
[78:23.08]Can we use it again?
[78:25.10]Let's go to the Bosco one, right?
[78:32.77]Theater diorama.
[78:33.45]There we go.
[78:39.37]I didn't have to do it.

[79:37.67]No, we can pull him out of here.
[79:38.61]Stop looking at me, woman!

[80:11.06]I got a job watching Bosco for all eternity.
[80:14.62]I don't have that much time.
[80:16.00]Can we just call it a day now?
[80:17.36]Is this game for kids?
[80:18.26]No, I just can't run away.
[80:20.13]It's like a car accident or a funeral, but not as beautiful.
[80:25.23]Senor.
[80:26.17]I am watching you all the time.
[80:28.61]T-H-E-M!
[80:30.85]Well, look, no.
[80:32.53]It's not, obviously.
[80:35.03]This is not a game for kids.
[80:40.90]Is this a game for kids?
[80:42.42]Oh, forget about, like, the naked guy that's over here.
[80:45.42]Nah, I don't know.
[80:46.04]You know, it's tough.
[80:46.72]There's some funny humor and... Alright, well, let's go talk to Bosco.
[80:51.60]What do I have in my inventory?
[80:55.30]coffee cup.
[80:56.24]I need coffee.
[81:01.49]There's some funny humor.
[81:02.23]It's a cartoon because it's, so it's four kids.
[81:03.61]Yeah.
[81:15.41]Yes, I understand what that... Yes, that is like going to GameStop and buying, like, Outlast for your ten-year-old.
[81:28.30]Because... It's a video game, so my kids will like it.
[81:33.90]Alright, what about here?
[81:34.48]My son said he wanted to have this game called Outlast.
[81:47.42]you know about the uh mature themes in that game shut up just give me it okay so I have nitrous ox okay so somebody up upstairs wants this right can I do anything hey hey there bosco don't look at me trust me we don't want to see you any more than you want to be seen
[82:12.73]What is actually going on here, Bosco?
[82:13.87]Why are you standing naked on a stage in front of your mother, your therapist, and a Mexican?
[82:18.35]Wait, wait, I know this one.
[82:20.15]I'm in some kind of one-man play, but it never ends, and I don't know any of the lines.
[82:25.72]Bosco's personal hell, a play in an infinite number of acts.
[82:29.86]Phew, I thought waiting for Godot sucked.
[82:36.19]What do you have to do in this play?
[82:38.01]No, that would suck.
[82:39.05]That's not cool.
[82:40.03]I could do this.
[82:40.89]I could be naked.
[82:41.88]That doesn't bother me at all.
[82:58.76]If I was just on stage naked and like there was fucking 5,000 people in the audience, I'd just be like, whatever.
[83:05.52]I don't care.
[83:06.64]No, don't care.
[83:09.04]Like, sorry guys, I didn't, this is not supposed to be happening, but I'm just here and this is what's happening.
[83:14.35]I don't care.
[83:16.39]You put me in like a dentist chair for eternity.
[83:20.13]I'll take the naked guy over the dentist.
[83:24.51]So, how are things?
[83:26.13]Oh, you know, not too bad.
[83:28.44]Except I'm in hell!
[83:30.72]Eternal damnation sure made somebody cranky.
[83:35.00]What if everyone was screaming at this balls, balls, balls.
[83:39.02]Everyone's screaming that.
[83:40.74]I mean, at that point it becomes like a show and maybe people will pay for it.
[83:44.14]And I'll start doing like the floss.
[83:47.40]To the beat of them saying balls.
[83:49.76]And then people start laughing and everyone just starts like having a great time.
[83:59.09]So what am I going to do?
[84:00.31]Who cares?
[84:01.49]Oh, I'm trying to buy things.
[84:03.62]That would get boring after ten minutes.
[84:06.00]Are you sure that would get boring after ten minutes?
[84:08.22]I don't know about that.
[84:09.20]I feel like I could stand that in the audience for like two hours.
[84:29.20]I mean, it would... That's... Balls!
[84:33.56]Balls!
[84:34.52]Balls!
[84:35.48]Balls!
[84:36.98]I could probably sit there and then think that was interesting for, like, at least a couple hours.
[84:39.89]And the person's doing the floss faster and faster?
[84:44.67]And they don't get to stop?
[84:47.57]You wouldn't pay $100 for a good seat?
[84:50.45]I would pay, like, $150 for, like, fucking front row seats and get, like, two, like, Bud Lights and just sit there and just have fun.
[84:58.13]If this is hell.
[84:59.98]They probably serve Bud Light in hell.
[85:01.30]I'm assuming they do.
[85:05.52]I forgot what I was going to say.
[85:11.24]Cheer up, Bosco.
[85:12.34]None of this is real.
[85:13.66]It's all an illusion.
[85:16.54]What are you talking about?
[85:17.93]Of course it's real.
[85:19.57]I've been pinching myself to be sure.
[85:20.97]Bud Light Lime.
[85:22.29]My face is real.
[85:23.47]My chest is real.
[85:24.69]My stomach is real.
[85:25.93]Okay, we get your point.
[85:29.33]Bud Light Lime is fucking disgusting.
[85:35.08]I remember when I drank Bud Light Lime for the first time.
[85:39.74]Alright, do you know what Bud Light Lime tastes like?
[85:42.28]Are you ready?
[85:42.64]I'm going to ruin this for you if you like it.
[85:44.06]I'm sorry, I'm going to ruin it.
[85:47.21]Do you know what grapefruit juice tastes like?
[85:53.95]Squeeze a grapefruit into a glass.
[85:59.29]Water it down with water.
[86:00.99]And leave it in the sun.
[86:04.47]Take it back in.
[86:06.61]And add yeast to it.
[86:08.01]And Ster it up.
[86:10.97]They tried to market that as some cool beach drink.
[86:15.85]No, you would just... Ugh.
[86:19.06]You know that they... Hold on.
[86:19.98]You know... Oh, this is important.
[86:21.04]I haven't been here for like four days.
[86:22.34]You gotta let me do this.
[86:23.60]You know they have like a special Budweiser now?
[86:26.64]In like a case?
[86:32.48]It's like a Budweiser in a case.
[86:37.34]Why do you have that?
[86:41.74]They're trying to sell it as if it's like some special secret beer or something.
[86:49.38]It's like a Budweiser Reserve.
[86:51.47]No, but what are you... The clientele of, like, Budweiser Red... Mostly.
[86:59.97]People that get, like, in fights at tailgate parties.
[87:04.09]They're not gonna buy that.
[87:04.77]That's just the way it is.
[87:11.21]I scared myself.
[87:34.29]He peaked the mic.
[87:35.73]Alright, so long.
[87:38.09]I can only stand girly drinks.
[87:46.68]What does that even classify?
[87:48.34]Okay, so we got, um... Nitrous oxide, keycard.
[87:56.14]Nitrous into the coffee?
[88:00.96]Bud Light Lime.
[88:04.37]No, we already know that I'm like an alcohol snob.
[88:06.23]You guys already know that.
[88:07.73]You guys have made fun of me extensively for it.
[88:13.90]Let's go check the other ones.
[88:19.74]Jeremy, you can't put gas in a mug.
[88:22.42]If you seal it with fucking... Reynolds wrap, you can.
[88:32.29]The special Budweiser you're talking about... That's funny.
[88:34.11]Why?
[88:34.19]The 50th anniversary Budweiser is to celebrate the moon landing?
[88:36.63]Why?
[88:36.71]Is it really?
[88:36.97]Did they put moon rocks in it?
[89:03.52]It's true.
[89:04.14]Oh.
[89:06.32]Hey, Sprinkle.
[89:17.09]Moonshine.
[89:17.53]I've had Moonshine before.
[89:18.91]It's a little harsh, but...
[89:22.41]Well, it is a bit warm, now that you mention it.
[89:26.39]But I can't worry about that.
[89:28.49]I've got too much work to do recalling this blasted toy.
[89:32.74]But these beastly children are ruining my concentration.
[89:38.74]What the hell?
[89:39.99]Up, upy, upy, up, up.
[89:42.47]Ah!
[89:42.53]Ah!
[89:52.27]I feel like that face that Caterpillar was making is just how I feel.
[89:56.49]Like, all the time.
[89:59.68]Right there.
[90:00.34]That one.
[90:01.04]I feel like that's me.
[90:02.20]I love that mood, you know what I mean?
[90:06.79]What dangerous toy are you recalling this time?
[90:09.19]It's the Rex Skirmish Danger Hero action figure.
[90:12.76]Completely irresponsible, and it just keeps coming back even worse.
[90:18.32]Oh, it's taken me four months just to get them to remove the candy-flavored lickable lead-based chest tattoo.
[90:27.47]Okay, well, what's the matter with the babies, Chris?
[90:30.65]Santa loves children.
[90:32.01]Why do people always assume that?
[90:35.60]I took the one job where there's only one day a year there's even a chance I'll be near children.
[90:42.19]With very strict rules that they're not allowed to see me.
[90:46.05]Holy shit.
[90:46.67]When you put it that way.
[90:47.87]How do you think a feral man like me has been married for centuries with no kids?
[90:54.11]Did you think of that?
[90:55.69]I'm trying really hard not to think about that right now or ever again.
[91:01.40]That is pretty true, though.
[91:07.16]What's going on?
[91:07.72]What kind of miserable work are you doing here, Santa?
[91:10.18]I'm recalling dangerous toys.
[91:13.36]Ah, I recall the dangerous toys of my youth.
[91:15.87]The savage tongue ripper.
[91:17.91]Little patio fisticuffs.
[91:19.55]The belligerent drunken leprechaun.
[91:21.91]Oh, I remember that one.
[91:23.59]He really wet himself.
[91:26.09]Having to recall toys must be horrible for you.
[91:28.84]Hellish, even.
[91:30.12]Oh, my no.
[91:31.80]I love recalling toys.
[91:35.38]The problem is these babies make it impossible to concentrate.
[91:41.73]OK.
[91:42.81]Have a Holly jolly eternal damnation.
[91:47.20]What did I do to deserve this?
[91:49.34]Looks like he's in Jimmy Neutron.
[91:51.34]Alright, demon babies.
[91:53.22]Leave the nice Santa alone and let him do his work.
[91:56.10]Santa has not yet learned true suffering.
[92:01.67]Anyone have coffee?
[92:02.47]Nope.
[92:05.11]Computer.
[92:05.95]Christmas tree.
[92:08.65]This long after Christmas and Santa still got his tree up?
[92:12.78]Hey, um... It's never a problem... Never mind, I was gonna say, like, it's not a problem if you leave it up all year and then it's Christmas again or something, whatever.
[92:21.75]You know, I've fooled with enough toy-playing switches for one lifetime.
[92:26.59]Whee!
[92:29.05]Must be one of those Rex Skirmish dolls.
[92:31.11]To your worst, Dr. Despicable!
[92:32.76]You'll never kill Rex Skirmish!
[92:35.82]Trampoline?
[92:38.48]Is this trampoline still useless?
[92:40.54]Yep, still useless.
[92:44.53]Anything else?
[92:45.63]It's fun to go back and look at old stuff.
[92:46.87]I don't know how to work it.
[92:48.25]Computers in hell all run Linux.
[92:51.79]Oh, wow.
[92:52.87]Programmer joke.
[92:55.17]This record player brings back memories.
[92:57.85]Oh, you never forget your first semi-successful exorcism.
[93:02.55]It's magically sealed.
[93:06.08]Okay, well, we have laughing gas.
[93:10.16]Anything else to do here?
[93:11.18]Torture me, Elmer.
[93:11.98]Must feel right at home here.
[93:23.52]Hmm, you want some Santa?
[93:25.78]I don't want to waste it.
[93:30.14]Let's get out of this one.
[93:36.58]Still have a couple more to look at.
[93:42.43]We did this one, this one, didn't do this one, let's go Toy Factory.
[93:49.70]Looks like some kind of vaguely familiar hellish toy factory, Max.
[93:53.83]Oh boy, I want to see the assembly line where they injection mold the dolls' heads.
[93:58.15]I hear it's strangely hypnotic.
[94:00.71]Oh, there's no assembly line.
[94:02.40]I make all my toys one at a time.
[94:05.08]It's the only way to guarantee each child loves it as much as I do.
[94:09.02]Okay, so this is a Santa competitor.
[94:20.28]I don't want to waste it.
[94:22.98]Oh, there's the casino machine.
[94:26.33]Computer.
[94:26.65]Okay, what else we got in here?
[94:27.87]We have this computer.
[94:32.67]Wait, wait, fire extinguisher.
[94:34.71]No, I can't take it.
[94:52.61]Look, Max, it's our favorite demonically possessed elf.
[94:55.87]Well, maybe not favorite, but he's in the top five at least.
[94:59.59]Oh, hey, guys.
[95:01.43]How did you end up here?
[95:02.61]We haven't seen you since the exorcism.
[95:04.89]How'd you end up here?
[95:06.21]I'm not sure.
[95:07.17]When I woke up, I went outside to find Santa.
[95:10.19]But the last thing I saw was a horrible monster.
[95:13.63]I must have fainted.
[95:14.95]When I woke up, I was in this fancy factory.
[95:18.03]I guess Santa gave me another promotion.
[95:22.49]Looks like Charlie Brown.
[95:24.37]Demon Charlie Brown.
[95:25.13]Ooh.
[95:53.21]Oh, he doesn't know.
[95:54.59]He really doesn't know.
[95:55.83]It's the hottest new toy for Christmas.
[95:57.99]The Rex Skirmish Danger Hero Action Figure.
[96:00.99]He's a testosterone-packed champion of the glorious art of savage brutality.
[96:06.41]Sounds like someone's overcompensating.
[96:09.69]The head office keeps sending him back, but I know I can make him perfect.
[96:13.70]Okay, so can we help him?
[96:15.52]Action, I wrote the book on gleefully violent entertainment.
[96:18.32]I'm especially proud of the appendix detailing the ripping out thereof.
[96:22.98]I live in Tampa.
[96:23.40]Me too.
[96:23.70]Cool outfit.
[96:24.04]Okay, I think we need some info here.
[96:25.66]Titanium?
[96:26.00]Commando?
[96:26.30]Wait, no, maybe make it, um, naked.
[96:51.21]That makes sense, right?
[96:51.97]He should be all buff and shirtless with a big flaming skull tattoo on his chest.
[96:55.93]Done!
[96:56.43]Now, what should his action-packed attachment be?
[96:59.64]Um... Magic spatula.
[97:03.56]A list of enemies.
[97:10.46]A list of enemies?
[97:12.14]Or a handbag.
[97:18.99]A handbag.
[97:22.49]Tampa, yeah.
[97:22.95]Everyone's from Tampa.
[97:23.79]We're all from Tampa.
[97:25.13]Alright, this is Bosco.
[97:26.37]Acid for blood.
[97:27.11]Brain disease.
[97:27.81]Chronic halitosis.
[97:28.71]Didn't Sybil say that she was trying to figure that out?
[97:53.01]Acid for blood.
[97:55.64]Debt.
[97:56.34]It's, yeah.
[98:02.06]Because we're going to, like, replace this with the Bosco, I'm assuming.
[98:05.58]Well, he keeps on giving us... No, he has plenty of money.
[98:11.33]Never mind.
[98:11.63]Bosco has a lot of money.
[98:27.87]Recalled.
[98:28.59]I made him a trillionaire.
[98:36.17]Yeah.
[98:37.91]There it goes.
[98:38.39]Alright, so let's do this guy.
[98:39.19]Alright, so... naked.
[98:41.18]Okay.
[98:53.30]a handbag a sequined yet tasteful handbag to show he's in touch with his feminine side I can do that okay and acid for blood highly caustic acid for blood and various related digestive disorders okay thanks I'll send out the new version right away
[99:19.66]Hold on.
[99:19.98]That goes into... Because Santa has the same shit.
[99:23.72]Hold on.
[99:29.40]Didn't Santa talk about this?
[99:34.34]No.
[99:35.03]I mean... Are these interconnected?
[99:44.95]They have to be, right?
[99:53.23]Hi there, Santa.
[99:54.91]Yeah, okay, so this is... So what's your problem?
[99:57.63]What's got you so down again?
[99:59.15]I can't work with these blasted babies, and I can't get rid of them!
[100:03.67]It's... hell!
[100:05.88]Okay.
[100:06.96]Uh, what toy are you making?
[100:07.94]Which toy is that you're working on again?
[100:09.66]Some deathtrap called the Rex Kermish Danger Hero doll.
[100:15.18]I'm gonna be recalling the hell out of this one!
[100:19.50]Yeah.
[100:20.41]Okay, so make it so he can't recall it.
[100:27.07]So there's nothing he can recall.
[100:28.31]We already heard this.
[100:34.57]How do you know that you're not in hell right now?
[100:37.63]I don't know.
[100:39.89]Could be.
[100:56.39]We can shoot them.
[100:57.18]Okay.
[100:57.40]Wait, what?
[100:57.94]I just murdered him.
[101:00.84]Acid blood!
[101:02.52]Uh...
[101:18.55]Did you come to enjoy my wonderful toys?
[101:22.25]I thought I'd never be rid of those blasted types.
[101:26.53]Why am I just dumping... Alright.
[101:31.44]I'm not pressing that button.
[101:32.60]He is.
[101:34.52]Oh, listen to that silence.
[101:37.74]It's heaven.
[101:41.11]Okay.
[101:42.11]So, we've made...
[101:46.95]Thank you, Sam and Max.
[101:48.85]You have been very good boys.
[101:50.91]Is that Santa's souls?
[101:51.59]But as long as Satan owns our souls, we have to stay put.
[101:55.58]Okay, so we got two.
[101:57.92]Hell efficiency.
[101:58.66]Oh, we're losing efficiency.
[102:00.06]Okay.
[102:02.58]Ooh.
[102:05.02]Let's go down to the cooking show.
[102:13.21]Now, my next dish is based on a favorite recipe of Grandpa Stinky's.
[102:20.63]Which I'm taking to the ninth circle of hell.
[102:23.98]To the base of milk and pickle juice, just add a little chocolate-covered horseradish.
[102:30.22]Damn!
[102:32.26]That was an emerald.
[102:33.48]Some of you guys don't know about emerald.
[102:37.08]Woo-hoo!
[102:38.92]Emerald is who made cooking shows.
[102:40.54]Cool.
[102:40.70]Nothing is that exciting.
[102:45.52]Alright, so we got coffee, nitrous oxide, book display.
[102:50.28]Growing up Stinky, the early years.
[102:53.03]Trashy celebrity biographies and hell are a natural combination.
[102:57.05]Everybody knows Emeril?
[102:58.49]I don't think so.
[102:59.13]That was like 15 years ago.
[103:04.80]Emeril has not been really on TV in more than almost a decade and a half.
[103:10.72]Alright, we got Stinky's baby book.
[103:14.72]okay what about bucket of lard I don't think I can eat lard on my diet emerald legacy oh microphone yes I have a question for miss stinky your seven layer bars turn my stool bright orange is that normal you will pay for your insolence what about the key the cooler's not for food it's for the inevitable organ transplants following the show put something in the food
[103:43.53]Sticky tar cake.
[103:45.41]Oh, here it is.
[103:46.73]Tar cake sample.
[103:47.75]That's one of the few things that's not better with tar.
[103:52.25]Oh, fuck.
[103:54.07]Okay, well, let's talk to Stinky.
[103:55.69]Well, well, well.
[103:56.69]So you're finally paying the price for offing your own grandpa, huh, Stinky?
[103:59.99]Do not interfere with my plan, Salmon Max.
[104:03.69]Uh, do you need a lozenge or something?
[104:06.39]Ah, that's not our Stinky, Max.
[104:08.23]It's just a demon cleverly disguised as her.
[104:10.77]Go away.
[104:14.70]Making food for Michael's birthday.
[104:18.54]I've been wondering when you two would show up.
[104:21.60]He remembered us!
[104:25.38]See?
[104:25.76]We were killed.
[104:27.19]Girl Stinky really did murder you.
[104:29.47]Maybe next time a couple of travelers from the future come to you with a warning, you'll pay attention.
[104:34.50]Murdered my impacted colon?
[104:37.00]T'was naught but a mountain climbing accident that felled old stinky.
[104:41.34]I'm getting a lot of references to, like, the last three days.
[104:47.12]In this episode.
[104:47.78]It's weird.
[104:50.64]Did you say you were killed in a mountain climbing accident?
[104:53.60]Aye.
[104:53.94]I was in the Himalayas, halfway up the north face of the devil's nipple, when me support cables just fell off.
[105:00.84]If only someone had developed a better adhesive.
[105:05.68]Interesting how those things work, yeah.
[105:07.70]How's hell treating you?
[105:08.84]You doing good?
[105:10.70]I thought for sure a mean old coot like you would end up buried up to your neck in poo or something.
[105:15.61]Yeah, this doesn't seem so bad.
[105:17.51]Not bad.
[105:18.57]Just look at that crowd hanging on her every word.
[105:21.95]And they've got the nerve to reduce me to her...
[105:28.74]Culinary dark arts.
[105:36.53]What does that even mean?
[105:37.05]Does that just mean you burn everything?
[105:41.47]Right?
[105:44.95]Like, what would be the bad thing to do?
[105:50.05]Evil cooking.
[105:51.56]Yeah, you just leave it in the oven for too long.
[106:02.24]Making mac and cheese?
[106:03.12]Hold on, you making mac and cheese?
[106:07.89]Give us the recipe.
[106:09.85]This stream is not going to go forward until you say how you're making it.
[106:14.03]I hope you don't say, like, box orange mac and cheese.
[106:17.21]I want to hear the real recipe.
[106:23.26]Don't say box orange mac and cheese.
[106:32.38]Craft mac and cheese with barbecue sauce.
[106:34.04]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[106:36.49]What if it is in the box?
[106:37.57]Don't do that.
[106:40.55]It's craft shells and cheese.
[106:41.61]No, one cheese plus three noodles.
[106:44.95]What?
[106:47.90]So Stinky's got her own show.
[106:49.38]What's the big deal?
[106:50.65]Every second this show stays on the air is like swallowing another handful of acid-dipped razor blades, twisting and churning in my gut.
[107:01.21]Well, as long as you aren't bitter.
[107:02.55]I actually love the boxed orange mac and cheese.
[107:11.69]We'll let you get back to the show.
[107:13.41]Yeah, we can't wait to try out... It's like, I love it.
[107:20.85]I told you guys, this is a long time ago.
[107:22.79]Everything I say is not, like, 90... I don't even need to say the fucking thing.
[107:27.44]You already know.
[107:28.10]Okay, so I got the book.
[107:31.36]I'll look for the fridge.
[107:32.08]Can't leave, can I?
[107:33.96]Alright, well... Let's try this.
[107:35.44]Hey!
[107:54.71]What was that?
[107:57.51]What was that guy doing in here?
[107:58.91]Two teeth?
[107:59.19]Wow.
[107:59.45]So we got Jimmy's file.
[108:00.23]Okay.
[108:00.37]Let's go to the car and try this.
[108:19.55]Shells and cheese is better?
[108:20.69]This is as fast as it goes, little buddy.
[108:25.49]So can I use... I have to go back to the real world.
[108:37.04]Shells and cheese is better?
[108:39.06]Well, I can't.
[108:40.70]I'm sorry.
[108:41.08]I cannot give you an opinion on that.
[108:42.96]It depends on the day.
[108:45.41]Sometimes you feel like shells, sometimes you feel like elbow macaroni, sometimes you feel like rigatoni.
[108:51.49]I'm not going to be a pasta narcissist here.
[108:54.57]Brady, Brady, Brady.
[108:56.65]We've taken a tremendous hit in efficiency.
[108:59.51]Are we going to have to demote you back to hourly?
[109:03.44]No, sir.
[109:04.48]I'll do better.
[109:05.60]Hey, Lucifer, we want to talk to you.
[109:08.78]What?
[109:09.20]I'm quite busy.
[109:10.44]Settling an appointment with my secretary.
[109:12.72]Man, Slater's a jerk.
[109:14.47]Who does he think he is?
[109:16.33]We're going to have to do some more damage to get his attention.
[109:20.21]Okay, so, um, let me go back to the car.
[109:24.78]No, get back in here.
[109:34.81]Cheez-Its?
[109:38.49]I mean, people crumble crackers, Cheez-Its, and stuff on their mac and cheese.
[109:47.36]That's, I mean, I don't see an issue with that.
[109:52.16]Baked macaroni?
[109:53.84]Red crumbs?
[109:55.62]Alright, let me go up here.
[110:04.61]He said cheese that's in milk.
[110:06.83]Yeah, but I selectively read the first half of that.
[110:12.27]Well, is this gonna work?
[110:18.50]Ah!
[110:18.58]Wait, what are you guys doing here?
[110:31.91]Timmy.
[110:48.12]Okay, how did... How could he be so cruel?
[110:53.94]Damn.
[110:54.08]Heaven?
[111:17.80]There's a heaven.
[111:19.74]Why not give him a break?
[111:21.04]It's out of my control.
[111:22.58]He can go at any moment.
[111:24.10]But don't worry.
[111:25.06]A kid with his permanent record is definitely going to heaven.
[111:29.12]Permanent record.
[111:30.78]Well, weren't you just down there looking at records?
[111:35.22]How's the death business going?
[111:36.68]It's finally slowed down, now that those rats have shuffled off.
[111:41.37]But it'd be easier if I didn't have to cover every death myself.
[111:45.34]Can I go take another?
[111:47.62]Help everything.
[111:50.38]Yeah, that's what you think at first.
[111:53.66]You've got a lot of work to do.
[111:54.30]You've got to take care of everybody that dies all by yourself.
[111:57.66]No, it's not as bad as it sounds.
[112:00.12]All my travel and expenses are covered.
[112:05.30]How did you even get up here?
[112:06.70]I'm looming.
[112:08.30]Part of the job description.
[112:11.30]OK.
[112:12.20]Take it easy, Harry.
[112:14.40]So I've got Jimmy's file.
[112:16.65]Nothing doing.
[112:17.67]Can I give Jimmy's file?
[112:19.31]Can I take?
[112:19.83]OK, Jimmy.
[112:20.51]It's Timmy Two Teeth's permanent record.
[112:22.25]OK.
[112:22.79]Looks like he's led a pretty sin-free life.
[112:24.74]So we're going to swap these.
[112:25.48]I always knew that kid was all talk and no action.
[112:27.06]Why are we doing this?
[112:29.55]Doesn't that seem, like, very bad?
[112:31.89]Hands off that permanent record!
[112:33.97]We're gonna get rid of him.
[112:34.63]By the looks of this kid, I'm gonna be needing that any minute.
[112:37.90]There's still a chance he'll pull through, right?
[112:41.12]Uh, sure.
[112:44.80]Okay, so how do we get rid of, uh, how do we make him leave?
[112:46.84]Somebody else has died?
[112:47.64]I need 20 milligrams of monosodium glutamate, sir.
[112:57.63]How come there's only one rat here?
[112:59.81]We're not very good at medicine, apparently.
[113:02.12]It's really pretty sad.
[113:06.96]Alright.
[113:07.66]And they can't upgrade the DeSoto.
[113:11.04]The nitrous speed upgrade is only for vehicles in working condition.
[113:17.07]We're sorry, but your vehicle is completely... I have to bring the vehicle back to life.
[113:23.21]Okay.
[113:24.44]I already got nitrous.
[113:25.32]He has a mustache body.
[113:26.74]What does that even mean?
[113:28.86]A mustache body?
[113:29.98]You know he doesn't?
[113:30.72]Oh, f***.
[113:54.61]Okay, well, obviously we have to get that file.
[113:57.17]We gotta swap it or something.
[114:00.07]Let's go in here.
[114:10.36]Hey, Sybil!
[114:13.88]How are things?
[114:14.96]Do I have anything I can do with you in here?
[114:16.42]It's been a while since we've last spoken.
[114:20.64]Can we give you anything for the wedding?
[114:22.47]Why can't we be in the wedding?
[114:23.87]Whoa.
[114:24.05]Yeah, we already did that one.
[114:25.94]Alright, so...
[114:50.26]Keycard, Stinky's book, coffee, hell coffee?
[114:54.80]What do I need this coffee for?
[115:02.03]Jimmy's file.
[115:06.04]Gun.
[115:08.00]Don't judge me for this, Max.
[115:09.50]It's for his own good.
[115:22.44]Alright, monster.
[115:24.62]Monster.
[115:25.19]I've never handled a monster before.
[115:28.85]I'll have to figure out how this works exactly.
[115:32.09]Mr. Opportunity, I'm back.
[115:34.42]And I'm knocking.
[115:37.60]Only millennials will get that reference.
[115:52.30]Thank you.
[115:54.06]It's Timmy Two Teeth's permanent record.
[115:56.42]Looks like he's led a pretty sin-free life.
[115:58.92]I always knew that kid was all talk and no action.
[116:03.78]Swap.
[116:06.86]It's for your own good, kid.
[116:08.36]It'll make the eulogy more interesting.
[116:10.38]What did you f***ing do?
[116:12.28]Give that f*** back.
[116:14.26]Settle down, Timmy.
[116:15.44]The doctors say if you exert yourself, those f***ers stole my f***.
[116:27.52]That's terrible That's so bad
[116:37.50]Is that really this kid's file?
[116:39.72]Harry, please.
[116:40.82]You can't expect us to do your job for you.
[116:42.91]I was warned it was smaller.
[116:45.25]Kid must have really been busy on his deathbed.
[116:47.67]You should have seen it.
[116:49.21]It was like every single letter ever written to Hot Bunny combined into one debaucherous rampage.
[116:55.22]Oh, well.
[116:56.00]You can tell me about it on the way to hell, then.
[116:58.48]Later.
[117:00.11]Oh my god.
[117:00.83]Oh my god, that's terrible.
[117:02.37]Holy shit.
[117:02.71]Do you want a book or something?
[117:04.92]Well.
[117:06.04]Okay.
[117:06.92]Let's go back to hell.
[117:09.02]I need to bring the car back to life.
[117:36.62]You've watched every stream for the past month?
[117:41.38]What's up?
[117:44.64]That's all really I have to say.
[117:47.82]Can I do anything with this thing?
[117:48.76]It works for everyone.
[117:50.94]Oh, it does.
[118:13.17]Is that a colonoscopy reference?
[118:14.67]How would that be a colonoscopy reference?
[118:16.89]Alright, let's go back to the... Let me see the efficiency.
[118:25.59]This is the first stream I've watched in a month?
[118:30.78]Welcome back!
[118:32.82]We're happy to have you!
[118:40.03]Nice to meet you.
[118:52.10]You Sam & Max dreams are my favorite?
[118:54.98]Well, I'm glad you like them.
[118:57.02]It's a fun game.
[118:58.36]Alright, so we've got hell.
[119:00.53]No more two teeth.
[119:01.53]We've got efficiency down.
[119:06.90]This is the last stream I've watched.
[119:08.36]Well, it is.
[119:08.84]This is currently the last stream you have watched.
[119:13.02]Unless... You have, like, three streams open at the same time.
[119:20.54]And even if you have, like, four or five streams open, I'm the person that you're listening to right now.
[119:26.05]I'm the last streamer you've heard.
[119:30.73]So, I mean, they just talked, but I'm talking now, so I'm still the last thing you've heard.
[119:39.14]No, can I just put it in there?
[119:40.94]Okay, cool.
[119:43.82]So now it's alive, right?
[119:44.46]Should I check it out?
[119:46.42]Let me just check it out.
[119:47.36]No.
[119:47.48]Go.
[120:09.23]Wow.
[120:09.91]Jump!
[120:10.41]Go for jump.
[120:13.65]That didn't work.
[120:19.59]Looks like Sam and Max got themselves into another jam.
[120:22.09]Oh, you're supposed to do this.
[120:23.13]Let's see what happens when old Bosco's demons get a load of this.
[120:25.63]Are we going into Bosco's painting?
[120:27.73]Are we about to save Bosco?
[120:33.26]Holy shit.
[120:33.84]Guess something else.
[120:35.06]I'll tell you what.
[120:36.54]I'm impressed.
[120:38.24]My mom walked in when I was watching Naked Bosco.
[121:00.46]Alright, we got Bosco sold.
[121:02.76]Fill efficiency is almost down to red.
[121:06.20]We need to do the cooking show.
[121:08.45]We've got to do something with the cooking show.
[121:11.81]I've got the baby book.
[121:14.61]I've got the coffee.
[121:30.45]We're almost there.
[121:32.97]And we'll find out real soon.
[121:36.24]After I take a piss.
[121:38.24]Don't go anywhere.
[121:39.42]Well, go pee.
[121:40.60]But take me with you, though!
[121:42.72]You know, if you're on a phone or an iPad, take the whole thing into the bathroom.
[121:47.22]Just like, no, no, no, take... Never mind.
[121:50.90]I'll be back in two minutes.
[123:30.09]Thank you.
[124:48.14]Okay.
[124:48.74]We are back.
[125:18.76]Did you miss me?
[125:24.91]So, cooking show, diorama, we need to get the souls out of here.
[125:28.13]And I'm not entirely sure how.
[125:35.33]Hmm, I still haven't done anything with the coffee.
[125:37.27]I'll save this for a ca- I've done Santa's workshop, we did the theater, we did the toy factory.
[125:42.51]Wait, did we?
[125:43.91]Is he still alive?
[125:48.79]No, yeah, no, I got it.
[125:49.33]Wait a sec.
[125:49.55]Where is Stinky?
[125:49.89]Oh, she's in here?
[125:50.31]Okay.
[125:50.43]Okay.
[125:50.53]Can I put coffee in here?
[125:51.29]Nope.
[125:51.45]Um...
[126:18.30]I feel like I missed something in this room somehow.
[126:23.74]The rats?
[126:24.71]How are you folks enjoying the show?
[126:26.61]I thought the casino was nice, but this?
[126:29.05]What a treat!
[126:30.29]I ain't no expert on food or nothing, but that Stinky's a master chef.
[126:34.07]I think we're gonna have to come down here for vacation every year.
[126:36.89]Yeah, it's pretty f***ing sweet.
[126:39.07]Tyrone!
[126:43.01]Now, Miss Stinky, I've warned you about the responsibilities that come with hosting a live program.
[126:48.91]It won't happen again, I promise.
[126:51.41]Okay.
[126:52.53]Just keep the language clean and that'll be fabulous.
[126:56.83]I'd hate to have to cancel such a wonderful show.
[127:00.13]Hey, Timmy.
[127:06.85]Hiya, Chimmy.
[127:08.75]Is your soul finally at peace?
[127:12.59]Oh, he's swearing.
[127:13.57]Aha!
[127:15.73]Aha!
[127:18.04]Aha!
[127:20.12]What was that?
[127:21.78]What is he doing?
[127:23.08]Calm down, kid.
[127:24.46]Did you taste her f***ing nut log?
[127:27.86]Whoa.
[127:28.98]Simply divine.
[127:30.40]I don't know if this might be... It's not a kid's game.
[127:31.89]Oh, my.
[127:32.57]Oh, no!
[127:34.11]And the smells.
[127:36.25]It's like teen p***.
[127:38.55]Ooh!
[127:42.75]I simply cannot allow this.
[127:45.02]This show is canceled.
[127:50.14]Well, that was exciting.
[127:56.24]What?
[127:57.05]Canceled?
[127:57.99]You're finally free, Grandpa Stinky.
[128:00.35]My show got canceled.
[128:02.29]Made to suffer like I suffered.
[128:04.89]I can't remember when I've been so happy.
[128:07.61]Is that a happy ending or not?
[128:11.36]I just can't tell anymore.
[128:20.27]I watched all 16 hours of Heroes of Might and Magic.
[128:22.87]I thought it was entertaining.
[128:24.25]Well, I've got news for you.
[128:25.19]We're in the red here.
[128:25.83]Heroes of Might and Magic is right after this game is over.
[128:43.16]After finishing season 2 of Sam & Max episode 5 of the last, this is the final episode, I'm going to try to finish that campaign that I was already on.
[128:53.17]This is a two-parter clean-up stream.
[128:57.61]Not a two-parter, it's in the same part, but okay, now hell is in a turmoil, let's go check it out.
[129:07.28]I was under the impression you were here to increase productivity.
[129:11.63]And yet our efficiency is at an all-time low.
[129:14.80]How do you explain that discrepancy?
[129:20.22]We haven't been properly introduced.
[129:22.06]We're Sam and Max.
[129:23.30]You know, from the statues.
[129:25.13]Pleased to meet you.
[129:26.31]I hope you've guessed my name.
[129:28.55]Yeah, and you better release our pal's souls from hell, because my excitable little friend is getting angry.
[129:33.57]And I'm angry, too.
[129:34.85]There's no need for that kind of talk.
[129:36.62]I'll gladly release your friends.
[129:38.88]Just sign this release...
[129:43.29]And that's that.
[129:44.46]Well, gee, Satan.
[129:45.74]Thanks.
[129:46.38]Now, just do me a favor and think of the most horrible thing you can imagine.
[129:51.70]Hmm.
[129:52.30]Okay.
[129:53.00]No, wait.
[129:53.68]Let's think of a horrible thing.
[129:55.04]Good.
[129:55.84]Now, off you go.
[129:58.32]Hey, what just happened?
[129:59.87]He traded his soul for that of all your friends.
[130:03.79]They never read the fine print.
[130:06.15]Now, Sam will spend eternity in his own personal hell.
[130:15.68]That's my favorite character, why would you take him away?
[130:25.54]Hell's a poppin'.
[130:29.76]No, you took away the best character and you replaced it with the worst character.
[130:38.88]Look, I'm sad too.
[130:40.50]Wait, hold on.
[130:42.62]It's busted.
[130:43.55]There shall be no letting off of steam in hell.
[130:46.01]No.
[130:46.21]At least I have all my stuff.
[130:53.07]At least I can bring my stuff to hell with me.
[130:59.62]A saw?
[131:00.20]A bone saw?
[131:02.30]Hey, a bone saw!
[131:04.02]Gosh, I hope I can find someone's bones to cut.
[131:09.24]Empty.
[131:10.36]There shall be no quenching of thirst in hell.
[131:13.28]No, he didn't do it.
[131:15.40]Dartboard?
[131:17.36]One of these days we're gonna finish that game.
[131:19.55]But I don't like darts, Sam.
[131:22.01]They're dangerous.
[131:24.23]Max, where are you?
[131:25.99]What are you doing here?
[131:29.03]Alright, peepers, let's talk.
[131:30.33]What are you talking about?
[131:32.52]I'm your partner and best friend.
[131:35.04]But, but... Stop being so silly and let's work on our next case.
[131:41.46]What happened to Max and why are you here?
[131:43.54]What?
[132:12.54]we did not I took the whole tub what case are we working on don't you remember the commissioner wants us I was a big baby bill on income tax reform it's fascinating alright well um let's go buddy let's be off on our new case
[132:41.49]We can't leave without doing extensive research, silly.
[132:45.33]Oh, alright.
[132:48.68]You, uh, caught me up, little buddy.
[132:51.68]But I didn't say anything funny!
[132:59.56]Where's the rest of the noose collection, peepers?
[133:01.87]Who would keep nooses in an office?
[133:04.79]That's just silly!
[133:06.93]Must get Max.
[133:10.71]hole in the wall who's in here hey sam how's it going in there am I like a dollhouse remember now you are my partner well duh um help me come in here little buddy it's the most horrible thing ever sounds fun sam but I'm too big to fit in the hole hey sam listen to this it's funny that's what she said ah get me out of here
[133:41.72]Yeah, that was pretty bad.
[133:43.30]That was awful.
[133:45.78]What's going on out there?
[133:47.40]After everybody saw what Satan did to you, it got pretty awkward.
[133:51.70]I don't like hell when it gets all tense like this.
[133:56.14]Well, you should be in here.
[133:57.06]The office just isn't the same without you, Max.
[133:59.06]I'm bored out here, too.
[134:02.15]Can you believe that Satan guy tricking me like that?
[134:05.29]Let's stack onion rings on his horns and throw them in the pit where they keep the gluttonous.
[134:09.73]It's that kind of thinking outside the box that makes me wish you were my partner.
[134:14.46]Yeah, Peepos sucks.
[134:15.10]Peepos keeps telling me he's my partner.
[134:17.28]What?
[134:18.04]Nobody tries to steal my sidekick!
[134:20.98]I always thought you were the sidekick.
[134:23.08]Oh, sure thing, Sam.
[134:24.36]Well, my name's first in the title.
[134:28.04]Can't you find a way in here?
[134:29.64]Think tiny thoughts.
[134:31.18]I always do.
[134:32.46]I'm still too big to squeeze through that hole, though.
[134:37.03]Okay.
[134:37.47]So I get to get bigger or he gets to get smaller?
[134:39.31]Okay, so that's... I'm obviously little.
[134:40.59]Can we leave the office together?
[134:43.21]We can't.
[134:43.47]Turn the lights off and bone saw him?
[135:04.11]unfortunately this is a 12 gauge bone saw and he's clearly nine gauge I'm small bones but I've got a big heart where's a heart song when you need one well why is this floating here it's taunting me with its precariousness can I shoot it can I bone saw it I mean is this can you can't die in hell missed Satan must have messed up my aim to torment me
[135:29.51]But you're a lousy shot in real life, too.
[135:33.29]I said Satan must have messed up my aim.
[135:35.88]Can I move the chair and stand on the chair and saw the rope?
[135:42.94]I can't reach it.
[135:44.02]Satan just put it there to torment me.
[135:48.69]Arsenic?
[135:50.99]Arsenic.
[135:52.15]I know just the person for this.
[135:54.45]It's past the expiration date, Sam.
[135:57.25]Totally unusable.
[136:00.67]Spoiled poison.
[136:01.79]That's the worst.
[136:03.29]Aww.
[136:09.05]What do I have here?
[136:18.87]So what?
[136:19.29]Just go.
[136:20.05]Get in here.
[136:25.05]Is it gonna work?
[136:26.67]I'm about to scream yes, but I'm not gonna.
[136:29.33]The peepers?
[136:55.55]He's dead.
[136:55.91]Let's go.
[137:13.47]Alright, Satan.
[137:14.97]Boss fight.
[137:17.42]That hell was practically inescapable.
[137:21.30]Sorry, Satan.
[137:22.46]Your demon imposter was no match for the true power of friendship and cooperation.
[137:27.02]Plus I ripped out his kidneys.
[137:29.36]Well, this does put me into a bit of a pickle.
[137:33.29]Management will have my head over this.
[137:35.27]Management?
[137:36.93]Who could possibly be more horrible and universally reviled than Satan?
[137:43.18]Who is Super Satan?
[137:47.65]Oh, it's the... It's the poopers!
[137:50.81]The soda... peepers.
[137:52.21]Um...
[138:14.55]Okay, so the soda team are the rulers of all hell.
[138:22.75]How did you guys go from minor annoyances to become rulers of hell?
[138:27.02]You still don't get it?
[138:29.24]Hate is the real power.
[138:31.88]We thought nothing could be worse than former child stars.
[138:35.68]But that was before we beat Brady Culture to death and realized we were destined for much greater evil.
[138:41.77]Okay, uh...
[139:06.26]What did we ever do to you?
[139:07.62]You only ruined our birthday.
[139:10.34]It was one year ago today.
[139:12.94]You thwarted my journey to evil pop stardom.
[139:16.53]And you gave me severe diarrhea.
[139:20.41]And these glasses aren't cheap.
[139:24.25]And worst of all, the mariachis never came to sing for us.
[139:30.19]Wow, who knew the princes of hell would be such whiny little babies?
[139:35.96]Well, what's with Santa now?
[139:37.12]So you meant to get Santa possessed by a demon?
[139:39.28]No, that was a clerical error.
[139:41.58]We thought some corporate efficiency would help Satan get his act together.
[139:45.30]But it seems he'll always be antiquated and useless.
[139:49.76]You know I'm standing right here.
[139:52.44]We did mean to kill that elf, though.
[139:58.20]So what's the endgame here?
[140:00.00]The old ways are dying.
[140:02.92]It's time to bring evil into the 21st century.
[140:06.30]Our subcontracting and outsourcing of soul capture and processing has increased our efficiency tenfold.
[140:13.27]But we still have to convince the shareholders to believe in Hell as a relevant player in the afterlife.
[140:19.23]Current marketplace realities and underlying economic considerations mean we have to downsize!
[140:26.29]Satan, we kept you on staff for sentimental reasons, but your performance continues to disappoint.
[140:33.39]But if you'll give me another chance... Clean out your desk and don't come back!
[140:42.48]What about the other ones?
[140:45.36]What about the other employees?
[140:47.08]We've heard quite enough, thank you.
[140:49.18]Very well.
[140:50.06]Now that you've helped us depose Satan, there's nothing stopping us from continuing our agenda for domination of the infernal realms.
[140:57.90]Right in the middle of that sentence.
[140:59.98]That would have gone flat soul against his nose.
[141:04.10]Like, bang.
[141:04.80]Footprint.
[141:05.20]Like, crush his face.
[141:09.75]Alright.
[141:32.77]I think unwittingly bringing about the apocalypse is a first for us, little buddy.
[141:36.23]Huh?
[141:36.63]Oh, sorry.
[141:38.27]I completely zoned out there.
[141:39.71]Did they say anything important?
[141:41.37]Never mind.
[141:41.91]Okay.
[141:44.89]So we need to do... Whee!
[141:49.24]Let's go talk to people.
[141:52.42]That's three things.
[141:54.62]Keep up the good work.
[141:56.12]Blarg!
[142:01.50]Nobody has any new dialogue?
[142:06.40]That's the list.
[142:07.22]Can I see the list?
[142:08.32]Why do they all start with S?
[142:10.73]Listen to that.
[142:11.69]They all start with S.
[142:37.85]Okay.
[142:40.93]So let's go to the new board.
[142:43.69]Action items.
[142:44.47]Conceive Hellspawn.
[142:45.69]Original Sin.
[142:46.43]Challenge for Soul.
[142:48.13]Two.
[142:48.77]Original Sin.
[142:50.25]Three.
[142:50.95]Challenge for Soul.
[142:53.11]Alright.
[142:57.21]How do we get... How are we going to do Original Sin?
[143:11.56]What about you?
[143:12.00]Do you have anything new?
[143:13.05]You got a new boss.
[143:15.13]So then I says to Gunther.
[143:16.39]I says, Gunther.
[143:18.53]Yes?
[143:22.07]Help us stop the poppers.
[143:23.01]You want to help us get Satan back in charge.
[143:25.72]Why would I do that?
[143:27.68]With that fossil out of the way, I'm next in line for the promotion at the next shareholders meeting.
[143:32.54]Wish me luck.
[143:35.92]Why didn't you tell us the poppers were your bosses?
[143:38.66]I thought it was obvious.
[143:40.69]You're a liar.
[143:41.21]You actually think someone could be as mean and despicable as that by accident?
[143:47.03]You are so slow.
[143:49.45]This is bullshit.
[143:50.49]You said you were going to start season three right after this.
[143:53.47]Liar.
[143:54.99]Did you see where Satan went?
[143:56.57]Where all the has-beens go, I imagine.
[143:59.74]Such disrespect for the Prince of Darkness.
[144:02.80]Hmm.
[144:03.52]Prince of Darkness is more like it.
[144:08.08]Well, now we have to wait in line to see the paupers.
[144:10.54]Jerm, a lot about the clown car.
[144:11.86]Thanks for the five community subs.
[144:13.94]Five community subs from the clown car.
[144:17.00]Thank you for that.
[144:18.70]I want to see the paupers.
[144:19.36]Call the paupers back here.
[144:20.68]They are there on a very important meeting right now.
[144:24.14]If you want to talk to them, you have to find them for yourself.
[144:27.12]We're going to go back to the real world.
[144:28.58]See you later, Jorgen.
[144:31.10]Yeah, sure.
[144:33.10]So anyway, Zenai says... Let's head back up.
[144:37.80]Wait, magazines.
[144:39.04]Anything else?
[144:40.58]Stuttgart Nightlife.
[144:42.50]Figures the reading material in hell would be two months old.
[144:45.22]Did I play Season 3 off stream?
[144:47.98]I just couldn't take it.
[144:49.14]I had to know what happened.
[144:50.04]No.
[144:50.12]No.
[145:01.80]Why would I play Season 3 before finishing Season 2?
[145:04.83]You don't skip a season.
[145:16.70]I spent 40 years tracking down the man who trashed my store hiring the best private investigators It's time you tell me where he is.
[145:21.56]Tell me where he is Well, there he is
[145:38.34]Bosco?
[145:39.52]Mama?
[145:40.58]You mean you never thought to mention that your suspect was my son?
[145:44.41]I thought it was obvious.
[145:46.97]You're the one who's been after me all this time?
[145:50.77]It was all just a simple misunderstanding.
[145:54.79]Yeah, that is pretty daffy.
[145:57.03]A lifetime of persecution, all just a simple misunderstanding.
[146:03.50]Hope you're not mad, baby.
[146:05.40]We all go a little mad sometimes, mother.
[146:08.00]Run along to the bunker, and I'll be in later with your dinner.
[146:11.82]I'm a ghost, baby.
[146:12.84]I don't eat dinner.
[146:13.80]Just do it!
[146:16.71]Bye, Sam and Max.
[146:19.37]Well, now that case is wrapped up.
[146:20.89]Wow, that was quick.
[146:22.23]You coming, Bosco?
[146:23.77]Party?
[146:25.05]That was just like a disconnected from server.
[146:27.23]No fade out, no drifting away.
[146:28.93]Maybe even crazier.
[146:34.93]Okay, well, let's go.
[146:36.51]We got a lot of things going on out here.
[146:38.47]Let's start right to left.
[146:46.10]Well, well, well.
[146:47.56]Specs, just what do you think you're doing here?
[146:50.88]I'm going to do what Satan never had the skills to attempt.
[146:54.84]I'm going to win the soul of a computer.
[146:58.92]Ha!
[146:59.30]You talk big now, but wait until you've heard me play.
[147:09.62]Beat that!
[147:11.06]You can do it.
[147:12.50]Play like you've never played before.
[147:14.60]Come on, Chippy.
[147:20.50]That sucked!
[147:22.27]No, it didn't.
[147:23.39]Well, then, I'll just be taking... Oh, but there's a technicality.
[147:27.53]Right!
[147:28.17]Subclause 48, Section 5 in the contract clearly states that entities running at less than 8 megahertz are entitled to infinite do-overs.
[147:36.66]I don't remember reading that.
[147:39.08]Oh, Spax.
[147:40.24]A perfectionist like you, and you didn't even bother to read the details of the contract?
[147:44.90]Well, alright.
[147:46.12]It doesn't matter.
[147:47.32]I'll still win.
[147:49.75]Okay.
[147:50.17]So, first of all, five community subs came in from Anonymous, whoever you are.
[147:57.05]Thank you for the five subs.
[148:01.13]Whoever you are, whoever the sacred person is.
[148:03.85]Alright, Chippy.
[148:05.91]We're gonna get Chippy some music.
[148:07.45]We're gonna get Chippy a... We're gonna get Chippy a video game cartridge from down below.
[148:15.53]Stick it in there.
[148:17.49]Right?
[148:18.25]I mean, that's what I think.
[148:19.11]Dump coffee on him.
[148:20.09]No, that would just break him.
[148:21.69]Hey, cops.
[148:22.15]What's shaking?
[148:23.17]Specs has challenged us to a music...
[148:26.20]Yeah, that's what we're gonna do.
[148:30.78]Second prize, eternal damnation.
[148:35.38]Who'd be stupid enough to take on that kind of challenge?
[148:39.25]We cannot talk you out of it.
[148:41.89]Okay, so... Hey, we want you to upgrade our car.
[148:47.35]We want to upgrade our car.
[148:49.03]We're sorry, but your car already has the nitrous upgrade installed.
[148:53.70]He's just afraid to go near.
[148:57.64]Okay.
[148:58.26]So long, cops.
[148:59.52]Stay virtuous!
[149:01.18]So, I gotta get the cartridge to put in there from down in the cartridge pile.
[149:06.97]Right to left.
[149:08.27]Let's go, Mac.
[149:09.77]Can I go into Sninkies?
[149:13.41]I can't.
[149:18.04]We use only the freshest ingredients in our pauper's own forbidden fruit of knowledge cider.
[149:24.76]One sip, and for the first time, you know the difference between good and evil.
[149:29.81]I don't know.
[149:31.45]I've heard some bad things.
[149:34.52]Our competitors are just afraid that if you start selling this, you'll become too successful.
[149:40.12]I don't need to tell you the advantages of an exclusive beverage distribution deal, seeing as how you're such a savvy businesswoman.
[149:51.36]I'm making fucking mac and cheese and nobody can stop me.
[149:55.40]Weren't you making mac and cheese like an hour and a half ago?
[150:02.40]How long have you been making it?
[150:05.84]It seems like pretty long.
[150:06.90]I think it's like takes 12 minutes.
[150:11.16]He's slow cooking it.
[150:14.94]Don't over, don't overdo it.
[150:16.53]Don't eat too much.
[150:20.33]Wait, I said the thing.
[150:25.55]Did I do, oh.
[150:27.96]Whatever.
[150:28.28]Alright, fruit cider.
[150:32.22]Hey, Stinky, how you doing?
[150:33.28]What's up, Stinky?
[150:34.66]Oh, good.
[150:35.54]It's Virgil and Ulysses.
[150:37.72]Actually, it's... Maybe you two can give me some advice.
[150:40.74]Mr. Whizzer's offer sounds very tempting.
[150:44.28]Now, it all comes down to your per-bottle cut.
[150:47.02]Don't accept anything less than 10% for the first year with quarterly renegotiations.
[150:51.26]I'll get a meme.
[150:52.22]It's like mac and cheese.
[150:53.20]Shut up, Max.
[150:54.44]Hmm, I'm still not sure.
[150:56.38]Well, hold on.
[151:00.40]Stinky's baby book.
[151:01.96]I'm pretty sure she's already read it.
[151:03.58]What about do you want to read Stinky's baby book?
[151:07.08]I don't think anyone wants to hear about Stinky's early years.
[151:11.82]What about Grandpa?
[151:15.54]Hey, Grandpa Stinky, we found Stinky's baby book.
[151:18.44]Good, good, quick, read page 33!
[151:20.67]I'm gonna take things with a cover on it, don't think I'm gonna put it in here.
[151:26.68]I love fake mumble reading.
[151:29.92]The Cake of the Damned.
[151:44.45]What?
[151:46.21]That'll teach her.
[151:47.85]Well, maybe you, good sir, would like to hear more about the delicious forbidden fruit of knowledge cider.
[151:55.12]Oh, no.
[151:56.42]What have I done?
[152:02.30]That has turned Stinky into a cake?
[152:03.28]The last person I would have figured was secretly a cake.
[152:05.90]She's been a cake this whole time?
[152:10.34]Nothing doing.
[152:16.29]Nothing.
[152:19.22]What was the point of that?
[152:20.14]Get lost, wizard.
[152:21.02]Stinky ain't buying.
[152:22.44]Stop interfering with my plans to bring hell on Earth.
[152:27.94]Well.
[152:30.18]What's going on here, Stinky?
[152:31.56]Tell me what's going on.
[152:32.20]Hello, my friends.
[152:33.52]Stay a while and listen.
[152:36.10]What turned you friendly so quickly?
[152:38.28]I've made a terrible mistake.
[152:39.98]You've got to help me get her back.
[152:43.96]You old coot.
[152:45.20]You tricked us into making Girl Stinky disappear.
[152:48.60]She didn't disappear.
[152:50.38]She's still there.
[152:52.14]When you read her true name, you revealed her true form.
[152:56.32]Her true form?
[152:58.04]Is she a demon or something?
[152:59.72]In a sense, I suppose.
[153:01.98]She's the most diabolical recipe ever created.
[153:06.10]The cake of the damned.
[153:11.92]Uh, did we hear you right?
[153:13.46]Girl Stinky is a cake?
[153:15.27]Aye, to start.
[153:16.65]I'd been experimenting with evil food for decades.
[153:19.11]What the fuck is this?
[153:20.53]You fiend!
[153:22.05]It was for the good of mankind.
[153:24.07]Humanity is weak and pathetic.
[153:26.75]Always complaining about food poisoning and severe gastrointestinal disorder.
[153:32.68]But only the strongest could survive my dishes.
[153:36.62]I'd create a master race.
[153:39.08]And the most vile...
[153:41.66]combining an entree, sides, and dessert all into one bowl.
[153:46.53]No, never.
[153:48.57]The kick of the dumb, dear.
[153:56.49]Okay.
[153:58.45]um well now what are we supposed to do do your evil spell and get girl stinky back to normal you've got to do what I did that fateful night the cake of the dam was only the first step I knew that to take the dish from just evil to purely diabolical it would need more an appetizer
[154:18.70]So I added spare ribs.
[154:22.34]Blasphemy!
[154:23.16]The next thing I knew, she appeared.
[154:26.38]I need spare ribs.
[154:27.28]The rib is the key.
[154:31.44]Serve us up an order of short ribs.
[154:33.09]I'll take an order of ribs.
[154:34.43]If I could find any, I would have already done it myself.
[154:37.67]With this barbecue convention going on, good luck finding anybody in the city with spare ribs.
[154:44.81]Alright, well, obviously we have to take a rib from somebody.
[154:49.51]Whatever you do, Grandpa Stinky, don't let Whizzer tempt you into making that deal.
[154:53.71]Don't listen to them.
[154:54.91]They're just jealous of your experience and wise life choices.
[154:58.77]Aye, well, he does have a point there.
[155:01.33]You really think a guy dressed like that knows about wise life choices?
[155:06.50]You're right, of course.
[155:08.40]Look at me, as weak an old fool as I've ever been.
[155:12.38]The girl always was better at keeping her head about her, much as I hate to admit it.
[155:18.48]okay so we need a rib to get that back to normal we need to just shave it off at this point you know what I'm saying stay strong stinky don't leave me alone with him uh what was it okay I need to get in what do I need to get and a spare rib a rib
[155:48.68]Let's talk to you.
[155:49.18]Alright, so we know what we need.
[155:52.20]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[155:53.30]Just check everything.
[155:54.44]No, this is bullshit.
[155:56.84]Alright.
[155:57.12]So, I need a rib.
[155:57.68]I need a...
[156:20.92]Um... A game cartridge.
[156:24.73]Two things that I need.
[156:28.81]So let's keep going.
[156:29.47]Right to the left.
[156:29.95]Satan!
[156:33.29]Can we borrow some of your stuff, Satan?
[156:35.29]Well, I suppose so.
[156:37.77]I was hoping to sell it on eBay, but I received no bids.
[156:42.00]You know, your screen name, FatherOfLies666, might have something to do with that.
[156:46.84]Let's see here.
[156:48.60]What do you got?
[156:50.70]One super long barb paperclip chain.
[156:53.32]And the poppers said you weren't being productive.
[157:00.60]Snack-sized bag of pork rinds.
[157:02.91]Great taste from the great deceiver.
[157:06.93]And one grocery list written on company letterhead.
[157:10.71]I know you're the source of all evil, but wasting office supplies for personal use?
[157:15.51]That's just wrong.
[157:20.32]God, I took it all.
[157:21.30]Okay, so paperclip chain, grocery list, and pork rinds.
[157:25.16]Let's talk to Satan.
[157:25.90]What?
[157:47.03]Alright, uh, hey, no hard feelings.
[157:49.28]I mean, that's true.
[158:12.26]How's the hunt for a new job going?
[158:14.06]A few nibbles, but nothing promising.
[158:17.54]I'm expecting a call from Rupert Murdoch next week.
[158:20.14]Alright, what about some advice, suggestions?
[158:23.14]Can you give us a rip, Hoppers?
[158:24.89]Oh, so we're stopping them now, are we?
[158:27.33]I just assumed since you spent so much time helping them.
[158:31.47]Gee, Satan, we said we were sorry.
[158:34.31]Or at least thought it real hard.
[158:36.41]Oh, very well.
[158:37.78]I began to lose power when people stopped taking me seriously.
[158:41.90]Too many comical football mascots and cartoon depictions on deviled ham.
[158:48.64]You can ruin their plans.
[158:50.80]Make them appear ineffectual.
[158:53.24]I'll be able to stage a corporate takeover.
[158:55.76]Okay.
[159:00.53]We never expected that getting you fired would leave you with nothing.
[159:03.62]Yeah, after all these years, you should at least have a retirement fund.
[159:07.34]No, my golden parachute is just this cardboard box of all my possessions.
[159:12.68]Will condemn for food.
[159:13.72]I feel somewhat foolish.
[159:15.26]God bless.
[159:15.66]Considering the billions of insurance salesmen and investment bankers I've met over the centuries.
[159:21.73]Okay, well, do you need anything?
[159:25.23]Get you a blanket or something?
[159:26.55]Might I trouble you to crash on your couch?
[159:29.81]It's just me in the box.
[159:33.47]We want to help you to help yourselves.
[159:38.63]Satan can't crash on a couch.
[159:39.61]I would do it.
[159:40.03]I feel like he'd owe you.
[159:41.25]You know, Satan owing you a solid is... That's kind of a big deal.
[160:03.87]You're going for a new job?
[160:05.30]I still have to update my resume.
[160:07.52]It's been Malenia.
[160:08.92]Make sure you include detail-oriented.
[160:11.18]Okay.
[160:15.96]The poppers are stealing all of your material.
[160:18.37]Yes, and from my glory days at that.
[160:21.51]If they're successful with this... Making a deal with Satan?
[160:24.21]They'll be unstoppable.
[160:26.31]What's the deal?
[160:27.17]It just doesn't have the same ring.
[160:29.57]No, the deal is, hey, buddy, you're crashing on my couch.
[160:31.69]I'm going to hold that over your head forever.
[160:33.57]That's not a deal.
[160:35.96]That's you said, can I sleep on your couch?
[160:39.38]And I just said, yes, we didn't make a deal.
[160:41.98]It wasn't yes, but no, no, no.
[160:44.24]It's just, sure, sleep on my couch.
[160:46.34]Hope you enjoy yourself.
[160:47.12]Do you need some water or something?
[160:49.03]For the rest of your entire existence, I'm going to hold this over your head.
[160:51.53]And when I need something, you don't answer.
[160:55.55]You look like a bad guy.
[160:58.93]Stay strong, Satan.
[161:00.23]You'll make it through this.
[161:01.81]You're a survivor.
[161:08.81]Alright.
[161:09.11]Will you stop doing this?
[161:11.01]That doesn't look hungry for pork rinds.
[161:12.77]Stop it!
[161:16.27]What are you doing this for?
[161:17.27]The DeSoto seems different somehow.
[161:21.17]I think I'll just walk for now.
[161:25.26]He's Satan.
[161:25.82]He already is a bad guy.
[161:29.18]Yeah, but nobody's the bad guy of their own story.
[161:32.10]We- everyone says he's the bad guy, you know what I mean?
[161:34.22]He thinks he's, like, the good guy, somehow.
[161:36.16]That's a handsome Jack line.
[162:05.17]That's- are you completely cured now?
[162:06.95]Hyped for Borderlands 3?
[162:08.28]Not really.
[162:08.60]What the fuck was that?
[162:09.98]What the fuck was- get that out of here!
[162:17.60]What the fuck are you doing?
[162:43.85]Glad to be back from hell.
[162:45.42]Oh, yeah.
[162:46.40]I'm just disappointed the f***ing soda poppers never showed up at the hospital.
[162:51.24]It was my dying wish to see them, because I'm their biggest fan ever.
[162:56.70]No, Timmy, that's wrong.
[162:58.58]Max is right.
[162:59.72]The poppers are evil, wicked creatures.
[163:02.08]And besides, I'm their biggest fan ever.
[163:06.46]Ask me anything about them.
[163:09.77]Alright, let me pay... Back to normal here.
[163:12.55]Alright, what is Peeper's real name?
[163:15.35]What's Peeper's real name?
[163:17.93]Easy.
[163:18.67]Everybody knows his name is... What?
[163:21.27]His name is fuck, fuck, fuck?
[163:22.39]I said his name is... You lose again.
[163:29.53]So we have to stop Hublis from censoring.
[163:33.80]I'm on top of the game today, guys.
[163:36.32]Stop Hublis from censoring.
[163:39.61]So we get the name.
[163:45.63]Are you old enough to write, Timmy?
[163:47.33]Oh, yeah.
[163:48.99]I've been in the hospital so much that daddy's been homeschooling me.
[163:53.77]So far, I've learned to write ampersands, asterisks, number signs, and exclamation points.
[164:04.31]Max is the king of poppers trivia.
[164:06.49]Do your worst.
[164:09.47]Okay, so what's the name of the wizard's doctor?
[164:11.93]In episode 205, The Joy of Specs, what was the name of wizard's urologist?
[164:18.28]Is that a trick question?
[164:19.32]Because in that episode, wizard saw a gastroenterologist, Dr. Thunder Cullen.
[164:25.38]Sorry, Mr. Knight, but I'm just too f***ing good.
[164:31.21]Max is the king of conversation.
[164:32.91]Alright, so, um...
[164:37.23]How old is Specs?
[164:37.91]How old is Specs?
[164:39.80]He's officially nine years old because he was born on a lit day.
[164:44.42]You lose again.
[164:45.77]Nine years old.
[164:46.45]Alright.
[164:46.77]Hold on.
[164:47.49]Max is the king of poppers trivia.
[164:49.98]Yeah, it really is just the past week.
[164:52.56]Okay, how many times has Whizzer been... I was going to say arrested.
[164:55.76]We've got to get him to stop censoring.
[164:59.43]What are you doing here?
[165:14.40]Looking after me until he gets back from his party.
[165:16.86]Playing song lyric trivia.
[165:20.42]Okay.
[165:26.30]So, we got some info here that we're gonna... I'm piecing together this gigantic puzzle.
[165:32.42]Let's talk to Mame Tram.
[165:34.00]Mame Tram.
[165:34.70]Mame Tram.
[165:35.36]Guess it's better to say goodbye to you
[165:43.50]Okay, um I didn't go right to left I was supposed to go right to left Oh Baby, I'm gonna be loving you all night
[166:10.22]Did he swallow that, like, microphone?
[166:12.20]I think he swallowed the microphone.
[166:13.78]Peepers is making the move on Sybil.
[166:16.04]She's totally into it.
[166:17.63]Just wanted to make sure my dementia hasn't kicked in early.
[166:20.27]You can forget all about old Stoneface.
[166:22.37]What the hell?
[166:23.61]Peepers is the only man you need now.
[166:29.25]Oh, Peepers.
[166:32.33]He ate the karaoke machine, or he swallowed the microphone of the karaoke machine.
[166:37.28]Fruit cider, bow and saw, paperclip chain.
[166:40.82]Satan's grocery list.
[167:02.31]Alright.
[167:02.55]One at a time.
[167:03.05]Hold on.
[167:03.29]Let's talk to Sybil.
[167:04.77]Sybil.
[167:05.82]Sybil.
[167:06.42]Sybil.
[167:07.08]Over here.
[167:09.98]Look over here.
[167:23.58]Don't be a fool.
[167:24.12]Show some dignity, Sybil.
[167:25.46]But he's just dreamy.
[167:28.20]It's like for the first time, I'm seeing him for who he really is.
[167:32.03]Ugh, I hate that.
[167:34.69]I have hate- I hate that.
[167:37.01]What the fuck?
[167:39.21]What about your wedding?
[167:40.65]Don't forget about Abe.
[167:42.27]Abe who?
[167:43.73]Oh, Lincoln.
[167:44.71]Right.
[167:45.37]I haven't forgotten.
[167:46.63]I've just- I'm still single tonight, alright?
[167:49.71]Whoa.
[167:52.26]What happened to the monster?
[167:53.93]Oh, is he gone?
[167:54.79]I wasn't paying attention.
[167:57.43]Said something about Abe's bachelor party.
[168:01.84]Abe's bachelor party?
[168:03.90]Does it bother you that Abe's having a bachelor party?
[168:06.52]No, we should all be free to have a little fun before we're married.
[168:10.72]Oh, stop doing that.
[168:11.78]I don't want to see that.
[168:16.79]That face is just... It's...
[168:21.96]Okay, well, we obviously have to break up the bachelor party.
[168:24.00]It's open!
[168:27.51]They're open!
[169:12.56]That hurt me saying that.
[169:15.13]So that's where the Esperanto bookstore is.
[169:17.03]Okay, so we need to... We need... Bosco's.
[169:32.66]There's a lot going on in here.
[169:33.84]Is Bosco the stripper?
[169:48.38]shake that money maker take it off take it all off
[169:58.63]Woo-hoo!
[169:59.27]Work it!
[170:00.07]Work it!
[170:01.43]Uh-huh.
[170:02.67]Alright!
[170:04.56]I knew women were hard to find in our neighborhood, but I didn't think it was this bad.
[170:08.58]You people should be ashamed.
[170:10.42]It's a living...
[170:26.52]Alright, what's in the cup?
[170:28.06]Mr. Featherly.
[170:30.76]Salmon, Max.
[170:33.04]You better not have a cow in there.
[170:40.77]Oh, I'll show you who's hiding a cow.
[170:43.65]This chicken's drinking vodka.
[170:45.05]Another celebrity meltdown.
[170:47.47]Shut up.
[170:49.01]You don't know my world.
[170:56.02]What are you doing here?
[170:57.10]You're not one of Lincoln's friends.
[170:58.78]I'm taking bets on which one of these amateur drinkers is going to pass out first.
[171:03.28]You ought to be ashamed, Jimmy.
[171:04.56]That's just wrong.
[171:05.46]50 bucks on the chicken.
[171:07.62]What?
[171:08.74]That's a pretty good investment.
[171:09.92]You should see a pretty high rate of return.
[171:12.46]Bosco, we freed you from your personal hell.
[171:15.04]You don't have to be naked anymore.
[171:16.92]Oh, that wasn't part of my hell.
[171:18.76]I just like to be naked.
[171:20.20]And I'm not the only one who should be naked.
[171:22.54]Woo!
[171:25.16]That's right, baby.
[171:32.81]Nah, I'd better keep it.
[171:34.29]It could take all night to solve this case.
[171:35.91]Sober him up.
[171:40.07]Take it all.
[171:40.67]Honest Abe, after all you and Sybil have been through, you got a stripper?
[171:45.12]Look, fellas, I'm marrying Sybil tomorrow.
[171:48.66]Today, I got needs, just like any other giant stonehead.
[171:57.85]It's a cooler full of punch.
[171:59.39]What are we going to put?
[172:02.20]Are we going to put fruit cider in the punch?
[172:04.86]This ought to add some kick to their punch.
[172:07.74]That's a snap right there.
[172:15.27]Well, boys, another round?
[172:17.33]Oh, dear.
[172:18.59]Oh, man.
[172:20.13]Oh, he passed out first.
[172:22.19]I'm naked.
[172:23.96]I'm naked.
[172:25.38]I'm naked.
[172:26.72]Oh, I thought we were all just saying that.
[172:29.36]What have I done?
[172:30.94]I'm so ashamed.
[172:32.94]He's going to do the camera again.
[172:34.68]I should have known hiring a budget stripper was a bad idea.
[172:38.22]Cool your heels, Flattop.
[172:39.98]The show's over, but I was just getting started.
[172:43.72]I knew it.
[172:46.11]There is no use for me.
[172:48.51]I broke it up.
[172:51.17]Congoline, who's with me?
[172:56.58]I am.
[172:59.72]Okay.
[173:01.34]So now, get out of here.
[173:05.31]Sybil's the only one for me.
[173:07.51]Not monster strippers.
[173:09.33]No.
[173:10.33]Alright, coffee.
[173:11.09]Let's go.
[173:11.61]Coffee.
[173:15.34]Is this the last we'll see of Bosco's paranoia?
[173:20.33]I hope you've given up the degrading exotic dancing career.
[173:23.35]Yes.
[173:24.33]I suppose now I just have to let this body go to waste.
[173:28.28]That's kind of... bad.
[173:30.56]Alright.
[173:31.28]Whee!
[173:31.96]Have you finally come to your senses, Flint?
[173:34.26]Somebody put a Mickey Finn in the happy juice, Sam, and I'm gonna find out who.
[173:38.20]Right after my head stops pounding.
[173:42.90]Uh, sober up.
[173:44.22]Coffee in the cooler.
[173:45.10]Coffee and punch don't mix.
[173:52.88]Can I get him?
[173:53.38]He has ribs?
[173:54.02]Wait, the monster has a rib.
[173:55.64]What do you mean everybody has ribs?
[173:59.06]He's made out of steel.
[174:01.61]And, like, stitched together clay and duct tape and fucking stone and stuff.
[174:07.85]And we've got the rib.
[174:26.33]They're all realizing they're naked.
[174:27.94]Yeah.
[174:29.66]I've never seen Frankenstein.
[174:36.16]I've seen Frankenstein.
[174:37.62]But this is not Frankenstein.
[174:42.44]Hold on.
[174:42.98]Let me scroll over his name for a second here.
[174:48.12]Frankenstein's monster.
[174:49.74]That's not what it says.
[174:51.93]Plus this steel here, metal.
[174:54.17]And we put stuff.
[174:55.45]I put, like, chocolate and rocks and stuff in them.
[174:59.03]I know what's inside of there.
[175:07.30]Confirmed.
[175:08.48]Denied.
[175:15.32]What, does he have bones?
[175:21.53]Alright, so we got the rib.
[175:24.85]Monster's rib.
[175:26.71]Let's go do that first, I guess.
[175:28.43]It's done.
[175:28.87]It was gold, not chocolate.
[175:39.76]Well, it was chocolate until we transmogrified it into gold.
[175:47.30]Yep.
[175:52.45]What?
[175:53.39]What happened?
[175:54.97]Sam turned you back into a cake, but then we- Whatever.
[175:58.15]Look, Mr. Wizard, thanks for taking all this time to talk to us, but we're not interested.
[176:03.41]But if you just- The lady said we ain't interested.
[176:07.91]Then maybe you.
[176:09.69]I believe the two of us have made ourselves clear.
[176:12.65]Ah, fine then!
[176:14.89]It's too good for you just- One sin foil.
[176:17.41]And stay gone!
[176:19.15]Looks like you two have learned an important lesson about cooperation.
[176:23.25]Fine.
[176:24.05]You going to order something?
[176:25.77]You can't just offer something, woman.
[176:28.32]You got to push the specials.
[176:30.44]I think I can do fine without your input, Grandpa.
[176:33.90]Oh, you can, can you?
[176:36.90]Very good.
[176:39.34]Well, let's just talk.
[176:40.82]So Stinky, why have you been lying to us all this time?
[176:44.02]You don't like this color of blue-green?
[176:46.90]You don't like teal?
[176:47.72]Why?
[176:47.82]I like that color.
[176:48.52]That's like... Part 1 of the Jerma985 logo.
[177:14.32]We just need some... Like, magenta.
[177:23.08]He hates one third of you.
[177:26.84]Yeah.
[177:28.84]You're a logo.
[177:30.34]I'm not a... I'm... What?
[177:33.82]Stay strong, Stinky.
[177:34.88]Alright, we did that.

[177:41.28]Now we've got to do the rest of this.
[177:49.85]Yeah, get some red, some magenta, some teal, some cyan.

[178:00.25]But first... I have... I know what I'm... I'm certain what I have to do with this.
[178:09.72]Let's go do this now.
[178:10.38]Because I know what to do.
[178:12.40]I know what it is.
[178:17.23]Redesign my logo.

[178:22.15]That's my brand.

[182:52.29]I still got the Tourette's, but that weird ringing in my ears has finally gone away.
[182:59.79]Sorry we ruined your dad's fancy casino, Jim.
[183:01.70]He wasn't actually swimming.
[183:02.84]Ah, that place was a real doo-doo hole anyway.
[183:05.10]Doo-doo hole.
[183:05.98]I like having the robot alive because he flippin' loves trivia, just like I do, when he's got an irreverent, in-your-face attitude, just like Daddy does.
[183:15.96]You're my best friend.
[183:17.06]He wasn't even being bad or mean.
[183:18.94]He's just adorable.
[183:19.54]Ah, there's nothing more heartwarming than the love of a rat for his abusive robot pal.
[183:26.36]OK.
[183:26.92]Well, hold on.
[183:27.38]Let me see.
[183:27.62]Max is the king of poppers trivia.
[183:29.72]Bring it on.
[183:31.94]OK.
[183:32.10]So did we get any squares here?
[183:37.19]In episode 205.
[183:38.29]Is that a trick question?
[183:39.31]Because in that episode, Wizard Dr. Thunder saw you.
[183:43.31]Alright.
[183:43.51]We got what we need.
[183:44.97]See you later, Timmy.
[183:46.51]Okay, so we have the real name.
[183:53.83]We also need the game cartridge.
[183:55.16]Let me see if I can get it.
[184:00.12]Wait, how do I get the game cartridge if the train is there?
[184:13.90]I can't do anything with a car.
[184:15.24]The decider seems different somehow.
[184:18.20]I think I'll just walk for now.
[184:20.42]I'm gonna look at my items.
[184:23.08]The book?
[184:23.88]Bonesaw?
[184:24.60]Paperclip?
[184:25.38]Pork rinds?
[184:28.96]No siree.
[184:29.52]I might as well do the paperclip.
[184:31.32]Is there anything changing here in the...
[184:46.47]You just let peepers know how you want it, baby.
[184:50.50]Say my name.
[184:51.96]Say my name!
[184:53.60]Hey, Dick Peacock!
[184:57.18]Wha... what?
[184:58.90]You ruined everything!
[185:01.28]What have you done to his eyes?
[185:04.28]You still wanna make out?
[185:06.20]Oh, hell no!
[185:11.26]Well, we've saved Sybil from a lifetime of regret.
[185:14.15]And given ourselves a blackmail opportunity to secure our financial future.
[185:18.17]Richard Peacock is a pretty cool name.
[185:20.39]Alright, so we got that taken care of.
[185:31.30]Is the wedding back on track?
[185:32.90]Yes.
[185:33.00]What do you mean, no, it's not?
[185:33.76]But now I'm behind schedule.
[185:36.35]Um, let's not mention any of that peepers incident around Abe, okay?
[185:40.39]We'll try not to!
[185:42.61]You know, a donation to my re-election fund would make it easier for me to keep my mouth shut.
[185:47.43]Okay, so we have two things taken care of, now I only have one more to do, which is the game.
[185:58.12]No, that's- but it's that- it's Dick Peacock!
[186:01.84]You're forgetting the first three letters of the last name!
[186:06.95]I would open up my own private eye investigation firm.
[186:22.77]Okay, now... I need a game cartridge.
[186:26.42]Let me see.
[186:29.80]Can I get a game cartridge here?
[186:38.79]This has to move.
[186:40.27]But if I get inside of it, can I get a game cartridge?
[186:47.31]I didn't think the game was that bad.
[186:49.17]Games based on a license are never a good business decision.
[186:55.55]There's one just sitting right here.
[186:56.77]I mean, look, that's... The text is facing the screen.
[187:03.10]Alright, hold on a second.
[187:06.38]That's right up here where the steam is.
[187:25.93]Is this going to be too hot?
[187:29.87]Whee!
[187:34.14]So that's where the Esperanto bookstore went.
[187:36.52]Yeah.
[187:48.58]Steady.
[187:49.56]Steady.
[187:50.40]Don't drop it.
[187:51.16]Oh, for the love of God, don't drop it.
[187:53.24]Easy.
[187:53.66]Easy now.
[187:54.24]You can do this, Sam.
[187:56.78]I win.
[187:57.28]I win.
[187:57.60]I win.
[187:57.90]I win.
[187:58.90]I win.
[188:01.89]Shut up, Max.
[188:05.11]Console.
[188:06.47]Here's a new song for you.
[188:07.93]And then all of them fail.
[188:10.13]And Satan gets to come back.
[188:12.63]Here we go.
[188:20.02]Make sure you read the license agreement first, Sam.
[188:22.78]It's very important.
[188:24.34]Just start playing.
[188:26.86]Let's see who has a better song.
[188:27.80]That was nice.
[188:28.28]You've got to admit it, Specs.
[188:50.61]Melted and started into a giant bar and make like a hundred grand.
[189:12.26]Good news, Satan.
[189:13.58]We took care of all three of those poppers.
[189:16.74]Well done, lads.
[189:18.34]Now come with me and watch Satan do what he does best.
[189:22.86]I'm intrigued.
[189:24.24]Boardroom negotiations and corporate power play.
[189:29.39]Oh.
[189:35.49]Here comes the finale.
[189:37.95]You've lost, poppers.
[189:40.16]Time we put an end to this charade and returned hell to its rightful owner.
[189:45.30]What Satan said!
[189:46.78]Poppers!
[189:47.74]Assume demon form!
[189:51.22]Behold, Peepers, the omniscient sea of the dark days!
[189:54.71]Guy Fieri.
[189:55.77]Oh, that's killing.
[189:58.41]Oh, that was spicy.
[190:00.61]Behold, Wizrail the Tormentor!
[190:04.09]It burns when I tease!
[190:05.67]You got Cayenne in there, man.
[190:10.33]Out of the park.
[190:11.87]Behold, Specs the Dominator of... Oh, come on.
[190:16.54]Those are your demon forms?
[190:18.96]They're different colors.
[190:20.80]Why am I always the only one who puts any effort into these things?
[190:25.62]Sam, I'm not enjoying the poppers anymore.
[190:28.46]Can I kill them?
[190:29.40]Not if I get them first.
[190:31.13]Banish the irritants!
[190:33.03]Sam and Max, we cast you into the pit.
[190:36.95]By the power of the bell!
[190:43.72]Book.
[190:43.96]The bell.
[190:44.68]Oh no!
[190:45.20]Now we gotta get out of the hole.
[191:08.02]Well, Max, unless we learn how to fly, we're destined to spend the remainder of our days on a tiny outcropping surrounded by impossibly hot lava, ash, and soot.
[191:16.47]I don't mind, Sam, as long as I'm with my best friend.
[191:20.35]Oh, that's sweet.
[191:21.48]So how do we go from here?
[191:23.14]Sorry, buddy.
[191:23.56]I already ate them all.
[191:24.32]We're gonna die!
[191:25.16]Somebody help!
[191:33.58]white ruby red goiters of Rube Goldberg.
[191:35.87]Look, Max, it's Santa's sleigh.
[191:37.71]That's funny.
[191:38.09]What an unexpected stroke of luck.
[191:40.39]Or is it, Max?
[191:41.69]Remember that time long ago when we jacked Santa's sleigh and drove it recklessly into a hellish vision of the future very much like the one we're standing in now?
[191:50.67]I stopped paying attention halfway through that sentence.
[191:53.49]I wonder if our ghosts are here guiding us right now.
[191:56.29]Hey, past me!
[191:57.91]Check this out!
[192:01.16]Classy as always, little pal.
[192:03.12]Now let's get out of here.
[192:04.98]Four crimes.
[192:13.69]This is expert handling.
[192:19.97]You escaped?
[192:21.26]That's highly implausible.
[192:23.12]Come on, Sam.
[192:24.84]Let's take this baby out and fly donuts around the seventh circle.
[192:28.58]It's out of power, little buddy.
[192:30.18]Guess I shouldn't have left the afterburners on.
[192:38.75]Is it cold in here to you, Max?
[192:40.97]I should have worn my mukluks.
[192:42.39]What the hell?
[192:42.83]Is it the same in there?
[193:03.75]Eggs!
[193:03.87]I got- I have eggs!
[193:38.65]Time to pay, poppers.
[193:43.57]On second thought, perhaps I'll wait here.
[193:48.19]Is this a snowball fight?
[193:49.11]Alright, ice ball right in the face.
[193:56.54]Fuck it, let's get Satan.
[194:01.52]Sing fast, wizard.
[194:07.67]Rock in the snow.
[194:08.51]Alright, we gotta... Hold on.
[194:13.29]What else?
[194:13.57]What's over here?
[194:13.97]We got a candle.
[194:16.31]People really shouldn't leave ritual candles lying around.
[194:19.69]Candle.
[194:20.21]We got coffee.
[194:22.15]What else do we got?
[194:26.02]Candle.
[194:28.06]What about the ice cream truck?
[194:33.76]No, stop doing that.
[194:37.87]It's locked.
[194:48.12]You can't shoot the rulers of hell.
[194:51.94]Say the line.
[194:52.76]No, I'm not saying the line.
[194:54.90]Okay, so what about, um... What about SCP?
[194:58.63]How you doing?
[194:59.15]Hey, SCP.
[195:00.05]What you reading?
[195:02.31]What came over him?
[195:03.67]He's actually being productive.
[195:05.77]We live in the wildering times, Max.
[195:11.04]Santa's sleigh doesn't work.
[195:12.28]It's out of fuel.
[195:13.50]Why couldn't Stinky have lied more?
[195:15.00]Okay, so I got the candle.
[195:17.36]What about the coffee?
[195:22.37]Ice cream bell.
[195:23.29]Maybe shoot the bell?
[195:25.91]Maybe they'll go over to the ice cream?
[195:37.08]Oh, the bell.
[195:37.72]Okay, hold on.
[195:42.15]The bell, the book.
[195:44.91]And... So then we can put the candle on there.
[195:48.10]Here you go!
[195:48.66]Bye!
[196:09.49]Time out for number three.
[196:12.93]No.
[196:14.45]Yes.
[196:16.77]Nothing happened.
[196:17.67]What?
[196:17.91]I guess one of the poppers has to blow it out.
[196:30.53]Ice cream.
[196:30.91]Plain vanilla.
[196:31.29]Okay, so I got ice cream.
[196:32.25]Snowball.
[196:32.71]He's gonna blow out the candle.
[196:33.61]Looks like a plain shit.
[196:34.53]Vanilla.
[196:37.40]Vanilla ice cream.
[196:38.84]Uh... Eat it?
[196:59.53]Do you want this?
[197:02.60]I gotta get him to, like, get out of here.
[197:04.62]You fucked it all up.
[197:15.28]Alright, there it is.
[197:15.86]Room.
[197:23.17]What about, uh, SCP's desk?
[197:27.01]Nope.
[197:29.89]Anything over here?
[197:33.61]Water cooler, microwave, bulletin board.
[197:36.11]Microwave.
[197:36.59]Bake, popcorn, and cremate.
[197:38.13]Can I put anything in here?
[197:39.49]Can I put ice cream in the microwave?
[197:43.05]Can I put...
[198:01.20]Why would I do this?
[198:02.04]Just a pinch of tar.
[198:03.48]Why would I want to do this to you?
[198:05.52]Demonic fish are hit hardest by the ecological disaster of a gooey molasses tar spill.
[198:10.27]Wait, what did I just do?
[198:14.27]Here.
[198:14.71]Ice cream.
[198:15.79]I'm making the... Alright, hold on.
[198:17.55]I'm making the cake.
[198:19.13]And coffee!
[198:19.73]A cup of Joe.
[198:21.15]Damn!
[198:21.85]Now, through the magic of television, let's see the cake in its final form.
[198:25.67]You make it look easy, Sam.
[198:29.21]Blow out the candle.
[198:36.14]No, put the candle in the cake.
[198:40.28]Put the candle in the cake.
[198:42.52]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[198:43.49]Candle in the cake and it's done.
[198:48.09]They baited me with the snowball.
[198:57.34]Got it.
[199:00.14]I know three princes of hell who've got a special surprise coming.
[199:07.44]Why, you... And then he gets happy.
[199:10.42]For us?
[199:12.20]Oh, you guys.
[199:13.86]Happy birthday, poppers.
[199:15.82]Did someone say birthday?
[199:18.38]I'm going to drop them all.
[199:36.40]Kill them.
[199:38.36]I don't think we'll be seeing them again.
[199:39.74]Don't ever say that again, Max.
[199:41.64]Not even as a joke.
[199:44.16]Well, boys.
[199:45.04]You've restored the infernal realms to their former glory.
[199:48.67]Thanks to your quick thinking and irrepressible spirit, hell is safe.
[199:53.29]I'm not gonna lie.
[199:54.53]I'm extremely proud of myself right now.
[199:56.99]We better run, Max.
[199:58.11]Sybil and Abe's wedding will be starting any minute.
[200:00.48]Oh, you gotta officiate the wedding.
[200:01.70]Let's go.
[200:01.90]Sybil's paying me by the hour.
[200:03.14]Does Satan go to the wedding?
[200:04.36]Really?
[200:06.96]I don't want you to get tired of me so soon, since you're going to be seeing so much of me later.
[200:13.90]I didn't like the sound of that.
[200:15.71]Don't sweat it, Sam.
[200:16.91]We're bound to get reincarnated as each other a few times anyway.
[200:20.23]You crack me up, little blasphemer.
[200:21.91]Are we getting to see the wedding?
[200:26.93]Love is in the air, everybody, so hold on tight while we get on board the wedding train.
[200:37.75]Season 2, Sam & Max.
[200:43.81]There it is.
[200:50.51]During credits scene.
[200:52.03]I'm gonna be quiet for this.
[200:54.66]Oh, hey!
[200:55.74]You're wearing white.
[200:57.16]Interesting choice.
[200:58.48]Dearly beloved, we're gathered here today to celebrate this twisted mockery of holy matrimony.
[201:05.26]It's so beautiful.
[201:06.36]We let him out.
[201:07.00]I hope they have lots of children.
[201:08.78]He came.
[201:09.20]He's out.
[201:09.54]You wouldn't say that.
[201:11.82]Do you have the ring?
[201:13.78]Oh, shoot.
[201:15.80]I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
[201:19.24]Hunter Buck says they don't last three months.
[201:21.27]Mazel tov!
[201:33.02]Ready, girls?
[201:34.93]Anytime!
[201:38.25]Denied!
[201:39.87]Fail!
[201:46.29]And what is it that you do?
[201:48.23]Listen up, because I'm only going to say this twice.
[201:51.37]I'm a bug.
[201:52.69]A bug!
[201:54.03]Interesting.
[201:55.51]May I interest you in a new blackmail opportunity?
[202:04.82]Oh, the zombies.
[202:07.58]That's so sweet!
[202:09.10]Thanks for coming.
[202:14.08]Thank you so much.
[202:15.84]Enjoy the dinner.
[202:21.99]Are we having the wedding?
[202:27.41]Along with the White House?
[202:28.47]Hey, this...
[202:33.24]The end.
[203:02.20]Hey, and that's the end of season two.
[203:05.02]But it's a question mark.
[203:05.90]That means, hold on.
[203:07.76]Could be another one.
[203:10.36]The poppers are going to be come back.
[203:15.41]You haven't seen The Last of Us, Sam and Max.
[203:19.37]We can never be defeated.
[203:21.93]We'll be back.
[203:23.65]We'll be back.
[203:28.31]Ah!
[203:29.50]Ah!
[203:37.31]Holy shit.
[203:38.73]They aren't gonna be back.
[203:39.61]They won't be back, actually.
[203:43.53]They just got torched alive.
[203:51.97]That's fucking funny.
[203:53.33]Well, I don't think we will see them again.
[203:57.13]Well, there you go.
[203:57.63]That's Season 2.
[203:58.89]We've gone through Season 1 and Season 2.
[204:04.50]So it is time...
[204:08.21]To put Sam and Max away.
[204:09.85]I know Jermba lied about, we're going to do Season 3 right after, but there was extenuating circumstances.
[204:14.83]Because I have a campaign in Heroes of Might and Magic that is still not complete.
[204:20.58]That I did say I was going to finish too, and so I figured today, first day back from colonoscopy, we'll just get some of these things that are not finished, finished.
[204:32.33]And Season 3 will come back.
[204:33.81]We'll do Season 3.
[204:36.86]I have some plans for streams of the next week or so.
[204:41.68]Week and a half.
[204:43.36]But as of like a week or two from now, we'll go back to Season 3.
[204:50.00]So don't worry.
[204:50.96]I promise that we will do all of these.
[204:55.19]But like I said before, I don't want Sam and Max exhaustion.
[204:57.77]Because that could happen.
[205:02.10]You know, it's fun and interesting and kind of comfy as these streams are.
[205:07.97]I'd rather spread it out a little.
[205:10.71]You know what I'm saying?
[205:12.32]So, we are going to move on to the campaign...
[205:18.64]that I left a few nights ago.
[205:22.38]I'm probably going to lose it, but that's what we're going to do for the remainder of the stream.
[205:26.00]If you do not want to see that, if that's not something that interests you tomorrow, we are going to do Cooking Simulator.
[205:33.56]So, I'm looking forward to that.
[205:35.65]It should be a lot of fun.
[205:37.71]I've been waiting for it for a long time.
[205:40.87]Probably going to lose in this campaign, but I do want to see the end of it.
[205:44.17]At least try.
[205:46.26]But I'll be right back.
[205:47.88]I'll take this opportunity to be right back.
[205:52.74]Grab a snack.
[205:53.72]Go to the bathroom if you need to.
[205:55.70]Heroes of Might and Magic 3 will be what you see when I return.
[206:00.31]See you soon.
