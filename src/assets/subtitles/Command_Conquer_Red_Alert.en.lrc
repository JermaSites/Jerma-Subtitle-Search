[ve:61.7.100]

[00:02.01]Good evening.
[00:04.45]Good early evening.
[00:05.43]How are you?
[00:10.42]Oh, dude, Minecraft?
[00:11.72]Today?
[00:12.30]No.
[00:14.98]The reason why we're starting a couple hours later is because I was actually in a call.
[00:19.24]And we were talking about all kinds of things for the Minecraft.
[00:23.28]Fuck the King server.
[00:25.71]That is, yes, still slated for the 15th.
[00:28.29]It has not been pushed.
[00:29.11]It's still going.
[00:32.23]It's it's gonna be I can't wait I Will have complete and full Details on how that stream is going to work tomorrow Tomorrow after the game awards we're gonna sit here and I'm gonna open up paint and we're going to go over how it's gonna work and
[01:03.08]If you have no idea what I'm talking about... Then... Check the stream tomorrow night.
[01:10.09]Because that's going to be half Game Awards and then half... Fuck the Camp.
[01:16.41]Explanation.
[01:20.77]So, I'm a little excited.
[01:22.09]Because not only are we doing Fuck the Camp... This coming 15th... I'm also about to play, right now... One of my favorite games...
[01:34.69]It's working.
[01:35.41]It works perfectly fine.
[01:38.89]I'm ready to rock and roll.
[01:43.34]We're going to play Red Alert today.
[01:45.62]We're just going to do the campaign.
[01:48.52]You know what?
[01:49.00]I don't think I've ever even done the campaign.
[01:51.04]I think I did the first two missions and I gave up.
[01:54.34]This was like 15 years ago.
[02:01.13]The campaign is really good.
[02:02.49]I know.
[02:03.09]I know.
[02:05.17]So that's what we're gonna do today.
[02:06.97]And maybe at this time, maybe I'll do like a skirmish.
[02:10.61]Where I really test my skills against like a good computer.
[02:14.05]There's multiplayer that you can do.
[02:17.37]But I want to do that with... I want to set that up.
[02:22.59]With like subs or mods or other streamers.
[02:25.35]Because that's more fun that way than just kind of detonating all the community servers that exist.
[02:34.33]So.
[02:35.81]We'll see.
[02:36.33]If I still am into this after today, then maybe we'll open up some multiplayer stuff with actual multiplayer people.
[02:46.86]You should do it with Joel so he can pretend to like it even though he hates it.
[02:50.50]I don't think you can pretend to like Red Alert.
[02:52.98]I think you just like Red Alert.
[02:54.63]You know?
[03:00.27]I dedicated my English project video to you.
[03:04.03]Hey, thanks.
[03:04.49]Did you make me look good?
[03:11.39]Alright.
[03:13.04]Are you ready?
[03:13.48]Are you ready to see my childhood?
[03:18.84]I am.
[03:21.56]Take a look.
[03:25.28]There it is.
[03:28.26]Red alert.
[03:31.04]And I got everything.
[03:36.22]There's no sound?
[03:37.80]No, there should be.
[03:39.58]There will be.
[03:40.92]They're going to remaster it.
[03:42.24]Well, we don't have time for remasters.
[03:44.33]We play original hardware.
[03:48.19]Why is there no audio?
[03:50.69]Is there actually no audio?
[03:56.03]Is it so low that you can't hear it?
[04:01.94]That's weird.
[04:02.28]Alright, you ready?
[04:04.81]This is, by the way, if you don't know what Red Alert is, it's the best RTS that's ever been made.
[04:09.89]What about Warcraft 2?
[04:10.69]No, no, no.
[04:12.43]Sit down.
[04:13.81]What about Warcraft 3?
[04:14.85]Sit down.
[04:16.37]What about the original Command & Command?
[04:17.77]Sit down.
[04:19.21]What about Red Alert 2?
[04:20.81]Alright, hold on.
[04:21.81]You don't have to sit down.
[04:22.79]But I don't want you to stand and interrupt my broadcast.
[04:27.75]What about Warhammer 40K, Dawn of War, the original Dawn of War?
[04:31.81]Alright, you can come up and stand here with me.
[04:35.97]Because that's the only other one that deserves to be there.
[04:40.75]How hard is this game, though?
[04:48.50]That's a lot of people.
[04:49.66]This game's very hard, isn't it?
[04:51.06]Alright, let's go.
[04:53.62]Ooh, what do I want to be?
[04:54.54]Allies or Soviets?
[04:57.63]I've got to be the allies.
[05:04.70]Allied headquarters, present day.
[05:06.84]Good thing I turned it down.
[05:12.63]Commander?
[05:13.05]The last transmission?
[05:15.29]Oh, 900 hours.
[05:16.71]Since then, nothing.
[05:18.13]Perhaps Einstein escaped?
[05:19.43]Too much to hope for, General.
[05:20.79]He would have contacted us by now.
[05:23.22]This is classified.
[05:24.63]I know.
[05:25.15]I sent for her.
[05:25.91]General Von Essling, she is a civilian.
[05:27.77]That's why I don't get killed.
[05:29.87]Commander, this is Tanya Adams, a professional volunteer.
[05:35.57]She has the best voice lines.
[05:36.41]She will work with you on this mission.
[05:40.49]Somewhere inside this research center, the Soviets hold Albert Einstein.
[05:45.31]We need him back immediately.
[05:47.99]Get Tanya inside so she can get Einstein out.
[05:52.26]Once you have located him, bring him back to your drop-off point for immediate evacuation.
[05:58.24]Be careful.
[05:59.46]The base is heavily fortified, but not invincible.
[06:03.02]Their weakness is power.
[06:04.74]Black out the base and nothing will stop you.
[06:09.03]Good luck.
[06:14.51]That's just, that's tiny.
[06:16.43]That's the best line in the whole game.
[06:23.52]We gotta go get Einstein.
[06:25.02]Here we go!
[06:26.90]Oh, I can feel the nostalgia!
[06:31.19]There it is!
[06:32.89]Alright, alright.
[06:35.51]Hold it.
[06:36.09]Let's... Let's go this way.
[06:41.57]Holy shit, it's like the blood's rushing to my face right now.
[06:44.13]I'm so happy to be playing this.
[06:46.23]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[06:48.71]No!
[06:50.04]Hold on.
[06:50.36]Back up, back up.
[06:51.38]I gotta do this correct.
[06:54.93]Why is the music so low?
[06:55.87]Hold on.
[06:59.79]Game controls.
[07:00.37]No, no, no.
[07:01.13]I want to keep that.
[07:01.93]Sound controls.
[07:02.47]There it is.
[07:02.77]Let's drop this.
[07:04.57]Let's raise this.
[07:05.91]There you go.
[07:06.57]Now it's normal.
[07:09.37]That's better.
[07:11.41]Okay, let's go.
[07:12.63]So Tanya, if you don't know, Tanya instantly destroys buildings that she walks into.
[07:19.57]Take out their resources.
[07:32.04]Don't get run over, don't get run over.
[07:36.85]Okay, I lost a lot of people.
[07:39.49]I gotta take out their power.
[07:41.41]Oh shit, this is harder than I thought it was gonna be.
[07:43.53]How do we get it?
[07:45.41]Where's Tanya?
[07:52.03]Alright, let's go.
[08:05.61]Get in.
[08:05.99]How do you attack move?
[08:08.37]How do you attack move?
[08:09.31]I don't know.
[08:11.95]Take out the power!
[08:12.77]Take out the power!
[08:22.12]Is it A?
[08:23.06]No, it's not A. Control is to target the individual.
[08:25.90]Take out the power.
[08:28.04]Easy, Tonya.
[08:28.58]Don't get killed.
[08:30.98]Alright, the power is gone.
[08:33.36]Take out the tech center.
[08:36.32]Got it.
[08:37.60]What?
[08:40.04]Oh, I just... Okay, I killed Einstein.
[08:46.53]Alright, let's go.
[08:46.99]Take out the buckets.
[08:57.47]I'm gonna turn music up and turn volume down.
[09:00.63]Take out the power!
[09:05.09]Alright, this is very hard.
[09:12.62]Okay, hold on.
[09:14.28]This is why I didn't ever play the actual video game.
[09:17.36]Because it's very hard to do.
[09:19.20]Alright, I gotta... Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[09:33.71]Alright, I want two different groups.
[09:37.76]You're group one.
[09:38.66]Group one, I want you to go take out this.
[09:40.48]Group two, I want you to take out the stuff in the base.
[09:42.88]Group one.
[09:45.14]Group two.
[09:49.83]Group two, take out guys on the right.
[09:51.47]Alright, don't destroy the base.
[10:03.40]Alright, back up, back up, back up.
[10:04.52]Is that enough?
[10:04.94]Okay, now I can take a second.
[10:06.20]Wait, reinforcements.
[10:10.88]Don't destroy the tech center.
[10:15.05]Alright, here we go.
[10:17.67]I gotta think this through.
[10:18.31]I gotta take out their power.
[10:19.89]We're gonna wrap around.
[10:20.77]Let's take everybody over here.
[10:24.37]Is it still powered?
[10:27.23]Take it out.
[10:32.84]Take this shit out.
[10:33.54]Kill their resources.
[10:34.26]Alright, take out their base.
[10:37.02]Destroy the whole thing.
[10:39.31]Yeah, we took the power.
[10:46.47]This is good.
[10:46.99]Alright, I just have to... Wait, I don't want to... Tanya can't die.
[10:51.34]They need to can Einstein.
[11:01.21]If Tanya touches a building, it instantly explodes.
[11:11.31]Alright, I'm good.
[11:19.62]I love this game.
[11:21.44]Get Einstein to the helicopter.
[11:22.70]That's Einstein!
[11:25.50]Alright, we got it.
[11:27.32]I did it.
[11:35.76]WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT DON'T NO NO NO!
[11:48.43]Why did they destroy the building?! !
[12:03.67]Fuck!
[12:04.57]I don't even know how to- how do you attack move?
[12:07.95]Alright, let's do it again.
[12:12.71]It's not A. Alright, just get in there.
[12:18.03]No, it's not A. Alright, let's go.
[12:25.21]I got him, right?
[12:35.82]You select and you right-click.
[12:37.44]What?
[12:38.74]Alright, we did it!
[12:39.72]I got Einstein.
[12:46.26]Alright, that wasn't so hard.
[12:51.40]What's going on over here?
[12:52.67]Oh, shit!
[12:54.65]Where were these guys before?
[12:55.63]Okay, that was very easy.
[13:00.23]Oh, God, this is going to be so loud.
[13:02.55]The cutscene is full motion.
[13:13.17]I got full motion loud cutscenes, great.
[13:17.43]Alright.
[13:20.51]Only... Alright, they had more casualties than me.
[13:24.61]Therefore, I win.
[13:28.53]I'm gonna turn the base volume down and then turn it up.
[13:39.61]Soviet aggression has increased tenfold already.
[13:42.51]We don't have the manpower to fight Stalin's armies on every front.
[13:47.55]Commander, you did a fine job rescuing Einstein for us.
[13:52.71]Now, we are counting on you again.
[13:56.31]One of the passes we used for a supply route has been blocked by the Reds.
[14:00.49]A convoy from the 434th is due through in a matter of hours.
[14:04.79]The supplies they carry are critical to our war efforts.
[14:09.50]That's not a belt.
[14:10.96]What we have in that area to work with?
[14:12.94]That's a power lifter support.
[14:14.36]Not much.
[14:14.72]And time is against us.
[14:17.92]You will have to make do.
[14:19.71]You wear that to bench prep.
[14:20.43]Clear the path so the convoy can get to safety.
[14:24.27]Their lives rest in your hands.
[14:26.89]Go!
[14:27.13]Flowers.
[14:33.01]Here's the best part.
[14:33.79]Here's the best part.
[14:34.57]Here's the best part.
[14:35.23]Here comes the best part.
[14:36.97]Wait.
[14:37.43]Clear the way for the convoy.
[14:42.43]I like to play a little bit slower.
[14:43.65]No, I don't.
[14:46.29]I gotta mess up the volume here.
[14:53.76]That's probably better.
[14:57.70]Take a look at this.
[14:58.84]You know where they all watch this.
[15:00.26]Ready?
[15:00.64]Bang.
[15:01.86]Power plant immediately.
[15:02.80]Oh, also, some people are probably going to realize.
[15:06.34]Where's the guy?
[15:06.86]Where's the guy talking?
[15:09.19]Where's the guy?
[15:11.72]I deleted him from the game.
[15:16.14]I literally modded the game to remove that guy talking.
[15:21.43]Building.
[15:22.13]Unit ready.
[15:22.81]Unit lost.
[15:23.53]Unit ready.
[15:24.11]Building.
[15:24.59]Unit ready.
[15:25.25]Unit lost.
[15:25.97]Unit lost.
[15:26.63]Unit lost.
[15:27.29]Unit lost.
[15:28.51]No.
[15:29.13]I modded him out of the game.
[15:32.40]Alright.
[15:33.12]I got an oil refinery.
[15:35.68]Let's go.
[15:36.02]Let's start clearing.
[15:36.94]I don't even need two groups.
[15:42.20]Alright, go down here.
[15:43.06]Wait.
[15:43.16]I'm gonna leave a Jeep here.
[15:44.00]You stay up there.
[15:44.52]Shoot him!
[15:45.40]If this guy throws a grenade and kills you, I'd be so mad.
[15:49.38]The 1 DB music is good.
[16:09.45]Alright, I... What is attack move?
[16:13.37]That's to attack a point.
[16:15.71]Alright, let's get that down.
[16:16.93]Oh, they're really... Oh, I got a time limit here.
[16:19.35]A-click?
[16:19.73]It's not, though.
[16:20.45]It's not doing it.
[16:21.07]Yes, it is.
[16:22.17]No, it's not.
[16:22.91]Attack move.
[16:23.35]No, it's not.
[16:40.64]This game was made before attack move was invented?
[16:42.92]No, no, it was not.
[16:45.20]Alright, we gotta... I need an engineer to repair that Jeep.
[16:55.49]How we doing?
[16:56.01]How we doing over here?
[16:58.42]Good, good, good, good, good.
[16:59.68]Ah, we need a barracks.
[17:02.18]No, you guys stay.
[17:02.80]Just stay.
[17:03.24]And there's like a way you can do like a guard, can't you?
[17:09.30]My base is not dying, it's fine.
[17:10.80]Alright, I don't think we can get through this.
[17:15.64]You don't have any engineers.
[17:19.06]Clear the way for the convoy.
[17:20.12]Oh, fuck, there's dogs.
[17:23.70]Alright, back it up, back it up, back it up!
[17:26.28]Don't go up there, you idiot.
[17:30.27]The base is right up here.
[17:31.25]Alright, we're just gonna... I just want a ton of rocket silvers.
[17:38.79]You guys go this way, actually.
[17:42.23]Don't kill dogs.
[17:43.56]What are you... They're... I can't help that.
[17:47.38]Can I do it?
[17:47.86]I know this is the doghouse, but it's important.
[17:56.72]It's a strategic location.
[17:58.50]Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[17:59.41]Don't be an idiot.
[18:10.01]More.
[18:10.31]More soldiers.
[18:15.48]Psycho Sprimmer can't help himself.
[18:17.32]What?
[18:22.60]This is clear.
[18:23.22]Alright, let's go.
[18:25.00]Let's go.
[18:25.35]Move in.
[18:25.61]Move in.
[18:25.85]Go, go, go, go, go.
[18:26.33]Take the whole thing up.
[18:27.27]Go for the base.
[18:44.52]No, just keep rocket soldiers coming.
[18:45.96]They're the best.
[18:49.43]Construction yard.
[18:50.17]Going down.
[18:59.25]My base is fine!
[19:00.27]There's nothing... Watch out, watch out, watch out!
[19:09.20]Oh, that guy died.
[19:15.56]Run him over.
[19:15.90]Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[19:17.60]Who's still alive?
[19:18.26]Convoy approaching.
[19:19.36]Oh, I did it.
[19:19.90]I got it.
[19:20.44]Oh, that's my... Okay, wait.
[19:22.16]Get in the convoy.
[19:44.00]They just have to be protected.
[19:45.86]Nice.
[19:46.12]Alright, I got it.
[19:46.90]Loud, full motion, loud video coming soon.
[19:49.95]This is the best track on the whole entire soundtrack, by the way.
[20:00.08]They're just gonna make it all the way up, and that's good.
[20:14.58]We can't hear it?
[20:15.28]Hold on.
[20:19.82]Yeah, but now it's like, now it's hurting my ears.
[20:22.71]Alright, hold on.
[20:29.57]I gotta turn it down for me.
[20:31.37]It's too loud for me.
[20:34.07]Good.
[20:35.37]No, not good.
[20:36.07]Alright, how's that?
[20:39.71]I can deal with that.
[20:40.91]That's good for me.
[20:49.48]Mission 2 complete.
[20:50.58]I love this.
[20:53.38]It's all coming back to me.
[20:55.80]Loud.
[21:08.50]It needs to drown out your voice.
[21:10.56]Why?
[21:17.67]Command and Conquer Generals was better?
[21:21.05]I don't think so.
[21:23.15]Just wait till I do a skirmish again with like two, like 3v3, it's gonna be nuts.
[21:31.40]Wait, did somebody just say I'm rooting for the Soviets?
[21:33.52]Alright, which one, up or down?
[21:37.66]Let's go down.
[21:48.64]It's a nice bridge.
[21:50.30]Intelligence recon shows heavy Soviet movement in your area.
[21:53.42]Nearby bridges are key to Soviet advancement.
[21:56.11]Destroy all bridges as soon as possible.
[21:59.51]Tanya will assist.
[22:00.55]Keep her alive at all costs.
[22:03.65]Destroy the bridges.
[22:04.75]Tanya has to stay alive.
[22:05.89]Yes, sir!
[22:17.41]Okay.
[22:21.29]How we doing?
[22:21.75]Okay, there's something over here.
[22:23.50]I, like, I just instantly killed that guy.
[22:33.36]Watch out, don't go, don't go in just guns blazing.
[22:35.95]I gotta have a strategy here.
[22:37.89]Shoot the barrel.
[22:42.45]Barrel.
[22:43.89]Fuck, I missed it.
[22:44.98]Oh no, it's gonna, like, press an alert button.
[22:46.44]No it's not, I'm fine.
[22:49.25]Wait, who just came out of there?
[22:52.67]Is it Medic?
[22:54.67]Oh, fuck yeah.
[22:55.11]Why can't Tanya be in Smash Brothers?
[22:56.69]Just one guy over here.
[23:16.85]Get used to those sounds, because that's all the sounds you're going to hear for the rest of the time that I play this game.
[23:22.41]And you wanted me to have the unit lost.
[23:25.87]Unit lost.
[23:26.37]Every time a unit dies in Red Alert, that guy says that somebody died.
[23:31.21]Unit lost. Unit lost.
[23:32.43]Let's rock!
[23:33.05]Unit lost. Unit lost.
[23:34.99]Oops.
[23:38.19]I just fucking murdered the medic.
[23:42.68]It's okay.
[23:43.28]It's still doable. It's still doable.
[23:46.99]I didn't know he was gonna... Alright, watch out.
[23:52.25]This is, uh... flamethrower turrets?
[23:55.40]Hey!
[23:55.68]I think I get this.
[23:58.00]Is this mine?
[24:01.22]It's not mine?
[24:17.82]I can't pick this up?
[24:18.98]Come on, this is mine, right?
[24:19.98]Why can't I get it?
[24:20.42]I'm taking this slow because I don't want to walk into... Why is this following me now?
[24:55.99]What's going on?
[24:57.13]There's three tanks over here.
[24:58.89]Alright, I have to shoot the barrel.
[25:07.70]Nice.
[25:08.28]Alright.
[25:10.14]Hey!
[25:10.80]Well, actually, that works out for me.
[25:12.10]I'm okay with that.
[25:14.32]Somebody said no cha-ching in like ten seconds.
[25:17.54]Sad.
[25:20.11]Don't walk over here.
[25:21.03]I'll burn instantly.
[25:21.83]Save the game, Raider.
[25:28.10]I wonder if I should go down.
[25:29.96]Wait, take out the bridge first.
[25:31.14]Uh-oh.
[25:32.78]What is that?
[25:35.82]Don't let him land!
[25:37.28]Don't let him land!
[25:39.92]Don't let him land!
[25:44.26]What's down here?
[25:44.90]Any reinforcements?
[25:45.78]Any medics?
[25:46.44]Any friends?
[25:48.02]Here we go.
[25:51.34]Crate!
[25:55.64]That's a crate.
[25:56.34]Crate.
[25:56.72]Give me the crate.
[25:57.22]Give me the crate.
[25:57.84]Crates are spe- there's an item in it or something in it.
[25:59.95]You can get like extra items and stuff.
[26:02.57]Alright, let's kill this guy.
[26:04.25]Don't aggro everybody.
[26:05.07]Money.
[26:07.45]Wait a minute.
[26:13.06]Oh shit!
[26:13.44]I got four engineers.
[26:27.24]Alright, stay here.
[26:28.40]Tanya has to take all four of these guys out.
[26:31.06]Unbelievable.
[26:33.62]Good work.
[26:36.05]Alright, let's go.
[26:38.89]Now where do I go from here?
[26:39.71]Up?
[26:40.17]This way.
[26:48.05]Don't blow up the bridge again.
[26:50.39]No.
[26:50.69]Don't worry.
[26:51.43]I'm not going to kill anybody.
[26:52.37]We're just going to go slow.
[26:56.61]There's a medic up there.
[27:01.70]Alright.
[27:02.60]I don't want to kill this.
[27:05.34]Oh, shit.
[27:05.72]Oh, shit.
[27:05.96]Oh, shit.
[27:06.18]Oh, shit.
[27:06.42]Oh, shit.
[27:06.68]Watch out for the grenade.
[27:10.84]He's hurt.
[27:11.60]Come on.
[27:11.86]Get over here.
[27:12.52]Heal us.
[27:13.12]Heal.
[27:17.91]Nice.
[27:18.47]Do it again.
[27:20.04]Now, you have to do it to yourself.
[27:23.58]Do it to yourself.
[27:27.28]Oh, fuck it, whatever.
[27:31.18]Alright, no, no, no.
[27:31.98]Not everybody walk in.
[27:32.82]Tanya just goes.
[27:34.53]Everyone will die.
[27:36.23]No, there's no selfie, unfortunately.
[27:40.35]Alright, Tanya, go up here.
[27:52.49]Wait, wait, what was that?
[27:56.41]Wait, wait, what happened?
[27:58.05]What was that?
[27:58.55]Uh-oh.
[27:59.17]Alright, what is here?
[28:01.77]Any more bridges?
[28:03.61]It's like a naval base over here.
[28:08.56]Alright, everyone get out of the way.
[28:24.51]We're going to take this thing out.
[28:25.41]How do I?
[28:26.33]Oh, we have to go across.
[28:27.17]Okay.
[28:30.55]So he's turning up the in-game voices.
[28:33.29]I'm not going to turn the in-game voices.
[28:35.95]Oh!
[28:41.19]Uh-oh.
[28:49.02]Yes.
[28:54.77]How am I gonna do this?
[28:58.69]I think I've screwed.
[29:04.25]Tanya's dead if she walked in there.
[29:05.50]Am I softlocked?
[29:06.74]Hold on.
[29:28.25]It's alright.
[29:33.77]I have a save point right here.
[29:38.53]Good.
[29:38.95]Alright.
[29:39.71]Don't blow that up.
[29:48.23]Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[29:53.27]Too late.
[29:53.63]That was too late.
[30:03.49]I do want to get... Where are the engineers?
[30:05.73]Oh, fuck.
[30:06.21]I have to get these engineers.
[30:07.59]Where's the music?
[30:09.39]This is weird without the music.
[30:11.98]It's strange without music.
[30:15.80]Cha-ching!
[30:38.22]Okay, save it here.
[30:44.60]My nostalgia.
[30:46.32]I know, really.
[30:47.26]It's true.
[30:50.41]This feels dark without the music.
[30:55.85]What do you mean, dark?
[30:56.59]Cha-ching!
[31:07.90]I'm there.
[31:08.62]I'm there.
[31:09.46]I'm there.
[31:09.84]Let's rock.
[31:10.80]Let's rock.
[31:12.44]I'm doing it wrong, actually.
[31:13.42]It's let's rock.
[31:15.08]Let's rock.
[31:18.71]Let's rock.
[31:21.01]I'll get it.
[31:21.91]Hold on.
[31:22.89]Let's rock.
[31:24.83]Yeah?
[31:27.03]Medic reporting.
[31:34.29]Medic reporting.
[31:35.25]Alright, heal yourself.
[31:36.05]What's up?
[31:40.11]Save it here.
[31:41.45]Good.
[31:42.41]We're still safe.
[31:44.59]Take this shit out.
[31:47.23]We can move across.
[31:48.31]He's scummy.
[31:50.20]Don't blow it up.
[31:51.80]Just go across it.
[31:52.22]Don't trigger this.
[32:09.24]When we get across, blow up the bridge.
[32:11.35]But then we can't ever come back.
[32:14.07]Alright, we're going to have an engineer go out and scout.
[32:20.87]Alright, good.
[32:22.73]We're good?
[32:23.92]Alright, you go forward.
[32:24.92]Test for the landmines.
[32:36.73]Okay, here we are, good.
[32:46.90]I don't like this.
[32:48.30]Alright, we're gonna take this out.
[32:55.25]The engineers can repair buildings.
[32:56.55]I think they can take them over too, can they?
[33:01.70]Don't blow the- don't blow- do not blow the bridge up.
[33:04.06]Do not blow the bridge up.
[33:05.02]Stay here.
[33:05.36]Snipe.
[33:05.50]Alright, get across.
[33:06.88]Chew on this!
[33:10.41]Chew on this!
[33:10.85]Okay, slowly.
[33:11.09]Okay, I'm gonna blow this up, but from a safe distance.
[33:35.41]Oh shit, is that destroyed?
[33:36.55]No, it's not.
[33:36.97]Okay, thank God.
[33:38.71]Oh my God!
[33:39.57]Oh my God!
[33:40.19]Run!
[33:40.55]Run!
[33:41.03]No, don't run.
[33:41.59]We're good.
[33:44.57]Wait.
[33:45.16]I think I just did it.
[33:46.50]I did it.
[33:49.74]That's it, right?
[33:50.22]Yes!
[33:51.84]Okay, we're good.
[33:57.38]Well, that would've sucked.
[34:14.25]That's supposed to be us.
[34:17.03]Turn your volume down.
[34:29.04]Unit lost.
[34:32.58]The only reason why you have that guy enabled is for... A-bomb launch detected.
[34:38.10]A-bomb launch.
[34:38.89]Charging.
[34:39.55]A-bomb launch detected.
[34:43.47]That's the reason why you have that guy enabled, but I couldn't.
[34:45.47]I modded him out of the game.
[34:51.47]Alright, we got another one opened up.
[34:53.69]Right here.
[34:57.98]Oh, Commander, we didn't see you there.
[35:00.38]Oh, there you are.
[35:01.76]Commander, I wish I could say I had good news, but not all of our battles fared as well as yours.
[35:10.00]The Greek front is collapsing.
[35:12.64]And Germany is all but taken.
[35:17.84]However, not all is lost.
[35:21.30]Your efforts have hampered Soviet progress in this area.
[35:25.05]The bridges you destroyed have caused the Soviets to redirect their forces through a certain mountain pass that I believe you are familiar with.
[35:34.35]They are gambling that you will not be able to stop them a second time.
[35:38.90]We got enough screens in this room?
[35:39.94]Prove them wrong.
[35:42.31]Stavros, expect a heavy concentration of Soviet armor.
[35:46.99]The base you established is still standing.
[35:49.29]Get it up to speed as quickly as possible.
[35:52.17]We're counting on you to keep the Reds from breaking through.
[35:55.31]Fake Jerma accent.
[36:06.95]We are going to stop them from breaking through.
[36:10.15]Cut!
[36:12.27]Hey, can I get a water, please?
[36:13.27]My throat is fucking killing me.
[36:14.55]Can I have a water?
[36:15.08]Destroy all Soviet units and structures.
[36:16.30]Let's go.
[36:16.56]Shoot it out of the air.
[36:17.38]Alright, I need a, uh... What are they doing?
[36:18.64]I don't like this.
[36:19.14]Okay.
[36:38.03]Oh shit, I got people down here.
[36:39.03]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[36:39.81]We got people everywhere.
[36:40.67]There's one guy up here.
[36:42.45]We gotta get this guy back.
[36:44.81]This fighting.
[36:45.39]I don't know where the fighting's happening.
[36:47.05]Come on, you can get back.
[36:50.76]Get back.
[36:52.94]One guy.
[36:53.32]Oh fuck!
[36:54.24]That's my base!
[36:54.92]That's my base they're destroying.
[36:56.26]I thought it was...
[37:12.00]Wait, what?
[37:13.52]Oh, this is laying mines?
[37:19.48]Okay.
[37:20.06]Don't let him just go over here.
[37:23.52]Get to work!
[37:24.19]Ugh, I need a noob.
[37:28.23]Kill him!
[37:29.97]Alright.
[37:33.01]You... I just dropped two mines for no reason.
[37:35.09]They're just gonna keep coming.
[37:37.61]Alright, put a mine down.
[37:45.20]Why's it not going off?
[37:46.20]Wait, what?
[37:57.89]This guy's crop dusting me.
[38:01.72]Alright, this is where it really begins.
[38:03.48]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[38:05.64]Give me a medic.
[38:07.48]And I get oil refinery.
[38:09.42]Come on, hurry up.
[38:10.64]Yes, sir.
[38:16.87]Where's their base?
[38:17.45]I don't know.
[38:19.71]Alright, back to work.
[38:20.43]You can do it now.
[38:20.91]Go on.
[38:22.21]And I got another.
[38:22.75]I got two of these now.
[38:24.33]Uh, pillbox.
[38:25.05]Go.
[38:26.70]Two medics.
[38:31.70]I want a medic with each group.
[38:34.94]What's my APM?
[38:36.12]Uh, probably four.
[38:40.77]Two pillboxes up top.
[38:42.21]No, I don't have the money for this shit.
[38:43.37]What's going on?
[38:47.87]There we go.
[38:48.23]Alright, I need... The rocket guys can shoot up there.
[38:52.45]Pillbox down.
[38:55.63]Pillbox here.
[38:56.49]Alright, you missed silo.
[39:03.10]Alright, that's good.
[39:05.04]Now we need... How are we doing on power?
[39:06.74]We're doing fine.
[39:07.78]Radar dome.
[39:08.48]This is a radar dome so you can see where everything that's going on.
[39:11.36]Alright, we got a pillbox.
[39:12.14]That's good.
[39:12.64]Pillbox down here.
[39:13.78]Tuna cans.
[39:15.00]Situated.
[39:15.54]Ore refinery.
[39:16.08]Doing strong.
[39:18.68]More rocket soldiers.
[39:19.40]They have planes.
[39:23.38]Silos.
[39:24.12]Needed.
[39:24.86]Silos.
[39:25.62]Needed.
[39:25.98]You guys... Trust me.
[39:26.88]You're going to be really happy that you don't have to hear this guy.
[39:30.36]Yes, sir.
[39:31.28]Medic reporting.
[39:31.92]Alright.
[39:32.90]I want to separate out... I want two groups here.
[39:36.73]Group one.
[39:37.63]I want at least three.
[39:39.91]Medic reporting.
[39:40.35]That's fine.
[39:41.09]You guys stay down here.
[39:42.43]Yes, sir.
[39:42.87]Group one.
[39:44.99]Group one.
[39:45.45]Take this up here with you.
[39:46.47]Yes, sir.
[39:48.14]Radar dome.
[39:48.62]Let's go up here with it.
[39:49.82]Yeah.
[39:50.20]Alright.
[39:52.66]I also want... Alright, alright.
[39:56.80]Good, good.
[39:57.14]Just defend it.
[40:00.47]What am I... I got a barracks already.
[40:01.75]We're gonna do... This is all I can build right now, so we're gonna do two barracks.
[40:06.15]You're probably asking, what are you stupid?
[40:07.79]No.
[40:08.37]The more of anything you have, the sub-tier under it will go double as fast.
[40:13.31]Ready?
[40:13.47]Check this out.
[40:13.99]Rocket soldier.
[40:14.45]Look at how quick this is going now.
[40:15.37]Check that out.
[40:19.79]Alright, I'm almost out of money.
[40:22.39]Alright, we're going to take scout.
[40:23.87]We're going to take the scouts this way.
[40:24.97]This is the team scouts.
[40:27.98]Where's the medic?
[40:29.22]Heal these people.
[40:29.82]What are you, stupid?
[40:33.66]Yes, sir.
[40:34.80]Ready and waiting.
[40:38.11]Alright, here come the scouts.
[40:40.22]Get them all together.
[40:40.88]I'm gonna get pillbox.
[40:42.74]Uh, I'm gonna say the tanks will be coming from down here.
[40:45.82]So that's a turret.
[40:46.50]It's better for tanks.
[40:48.24]This is team one.
[40:49.38]They're going to stay up.
[40:50.52]Oh god, look at me.
[40:51.42]Oh, look at me.
[40:51.95]I can do that.
[40:52.75]Instantly dead.
[40:53.87]Not even... They're going.
[40:59.83]Don't kill this!
[41:03.03]I need engineers.
[41:03.55]I don't have any engineers.
[41:04.96]Fuck.
[41:05.16]Okay, alright, alright.
[41:06.74]Where's team one?
[41:08.46]You guys have to protect.
[41:11.28]Alright, let's go.
[41:17.19]Team 1.
[41:19.55]Stay in this area.
[41:20.61]Wait, there's a guard button.
[41:23.49]I know there is.
[41:24.03]I played this game when I was like fucking 12.
[41:25.32]I know there's a guard button.
[41:28.48]Alright, what do we got?
[41:29.52]1900?
[41:29.96]Get another, uh... Get another ore refinery.
[41:32.95]No.
[41:34.21]Another pillbox.
[41:34.93]No.
[41:35.67]Yeah, another pillbox.
[41:37.11]Let's go scout.
[41:40.81]G is guarding.
[41:45.28]G, behold... Isn't there a patrol, too?
[41:47.44]Alright, where do I want this?
[41:51.16]Probably over here.
[41:56.91]Okay, hold on.
[41:57.53]You hold P. Acknowledged.
[41:59.97]Does that work?
[42:00.49]I just held it.
[42:02.63]No.
[42:03.03]Why is it not working?
[42:04.83]That was red alert, too.
[42:05.73]Alright, hold on.
[42:06.19]This is bad.
[42:07.07]Yes, sir.
[42:07.47]Wait for the rocketeers.
[42:10.12]We're going in.
[42:10.64]Go for the tank first.
[42:11.30]Go.
[42:17.26]Kill the tank.
[42:17.78]Kill the tank.
[42:19.06]Don't let them... Don't let them just run you over.
[42:25.75]Disaster.
[42:26.75]Absolute fucking disaster.
[42:35.93]Are they gonna counter?
[42:36.91]Okay, they're coming in for a counter.
[42:38.59]Run them over.
[42:43.81]I need a war factory.
[42:49.17]I got destroyed, I know.
[42:54.08]Three guys in a tank versus 15 people.
[42:58.66]Yes, sir.
[43:03.35]Good.
[43:03.85]Okay.
[43:04.13]Keep going.
[43:04.41]Where's that war factory?
[43:05.25]I need money.
[43:09.23]Repair the buildings?
[43:10.41]I need an engineer.
[43:12.50]I think you need a war factory for an engineer.
[43:38.65]Alright give me my war factory.
[43:41.87]Stop, stop, stop. Stop betting money.
[43:43.21]These are all -
[43:47.21]They'll never expect it let's go.
[43:49.67]Oh, fuck.
[43:51.61]Get him in.
[43:53.07]Look at all these rockets.
[43:54.89]I'm gonna melt this thing.
[43:55.45]Watch this.
[43:55.77]Nice.
[43:55.95]Good.
[43:56.07]Go this way.
[44:04.00]Kim, I need my war factory.
[44:05.58]I need more money!
[44:18.71]Hurry up and pick this up!
[44:20.49]Agreed.
[44:22.05]These guys are so slow.
[44:22.99]I need the things to carry them.
[44:26.83]Can tanks take that many rockets?
[44:28.11]No, the rocket guys are amazing against tanks.
[44:31.13]And I'm one of those idiots that only makes rocket guys, and they get destroyed by regular infantry.
[44:39.16]Give me another war truck.
[44:40.34]Ready and waiting.
[44:41.50]At once.
[44:43.06]Save the game here, too, by the way.
[44:49.24]Alright.
[44:50.10]Don't go all the way around.
[44:51.78]Stop, stop, stop.
[44:52.56]What are you doing?
[44:57.43]Where's that base?
[44:58.29]It's like right here.
[44:59.57]Alright.
[45:00.25]Here we go.
[45:01.19]If they counterattack, I lose.
[45:03.33]Okay.
[45:11.76]Retreat.
[45:12.02]Retreat.
[45:12.28]Retreat.
[45:12.52]Back up.
[45:12.79]Back up.
[45:12.99]Back up.
[45:13.23]Not worth it.
[45:13.95]Not gonna happen.
[45:14.67]Retreat.
[45:15.01]Retreat.
[45:15.37]Retreat.
[45:15.75]Retreat.
[45:16.09]Don't go in.
[45:17.27]Don't go in.
[45:18.79]Bad idea.
[45:20.45]Alright.
[45:21.19]He singled himself out.
[45:22.05]He's an idiot.
[45:22.53]Get him.
[45:22.79]They have three tanks.
[45:24.82]I'm gonna lose it.
[45:26.26]Back up to the base.
[45:26.88]Back to the base.
[45:27.30]Back to the base.
[45:32.14]Alright.
[45:32.34]Now at least I can see where they are.
[46:01.57]Oh, shit.
[46:02.23]Oh, shit.
[46:02.57]Oh, shit.
[46:02.91]Oh, shit.
[46:03.21]Oh, shit.
[46:03.55]Oh, shit.
[46:03.93]Oh, no.
[46:04.35]Oh, no.
[46:04.75]Oh, no.
[46:05.15]Oh, no.
[46:05.39]Oh, no.
[46:05.63]Oh, no.
[46:05.95]They're getting ready.
[46:06.63]They're getting ready to come this way.
[46:08.33]Everybody get over here.
[46:16.26]Okay, now this thing is useless.
[46:19.72]I don't have any money.
[46:20.50]I spent my resources so poorly.
[46:22.54]What's firing?
[46:24.20]Oh, my God.
[46:24.64]I'm going to lose.
[46:26.32]Oh, this is terrible.
[46:27.56]Yes, sir.
[46:28.08]Stay back.
[46:28.46]Stay back.
[46:28.80]Stay back.
[46:29.16]Just deposit your money and stay here.
[46:30.40]Yes, sir.
[46:34.35]Deposit your money and stay.
[46:37.41]Some of you go, alright, I need, I spent my money in bad places.
[46:48.08]Kill it!
[46:48.90]Kill it!
[46:49.38]Kill it!
[47:07.84]Get the fuck out of here.
[47:11.14]Alright, we can go back to work.
[47:15.66]Not yet.
[47:16.64]Spread them over.
[47:25.69]Okay, we're looking good.
[47:29.71]Okay, here they come.
[47:30.23]This is the next phase.
[47:31.17]What shitty APM they have.
[47:41.95]Don't run him over.
[47:46.45]Take it out!
[47:49.11]Good!
[47:50.67]Don't ever underestimate a dickload of rocket guys.
[47:54.69]Alright, I need to start- I gotta start- Oh my god, they're just gonna forever feed people over here, aren't they?
[48:02.70]That's the never-ending harass.
[48:04.46]Get it.
[48:05.62]Strike first.
[48:17.73]Kill them!
[48:19.29]Yeah!
[48:21.17]Okay, now I got some- my money's back.
[48:23.53]Where's my ore trucks?
[48:24.57]They're all doing well?
[48:27.04]Tanks.
[48:27.34]I just want tanks.
[48:32.88]God damn it, these are so slow.
[48:41.40]I need them to-
[48:45.76]Another war factory?
[48:46.80]Those are expensive, though.
[48:49.51]The two thousand dollars.
[48:50.75]I just need to get a couple more tanks.
[48:55.81]I would feel comfortable with four tanks.
[48:59.13]So after this, we're going.
[49:08.48]This thing is... Alright, this thing's useless.
[49:09.88]I'm just gonna... I'm gonna run this thing to its death.
[49:12.47]So I can see what's going on over there.
[49:17.77]The computer mouse can just go die up here if he cares.
[49:32.06]Go, go, go, go.
[49:34.38]You need to see what's up here.
[49:36.52]You idiot.
[49:37.39]Why'd you stop?
[49:38.21]I think that's it.
[49:39.67]I think we can go.
[49:40.47]They have heavy tanks, though.
[49:41.57]Uh-oh.
[49:42.75]Alright, I'm gonna do it.
[49:43.89]I'm good.
[49:46.26]No, they have a base right here.
[49:48.18]This is where I can make it happen.
[49:52.06]Another tank.
[49:52.74]More tanks.
[49:53.30]And another turret, too.
[49:59.96]Okay, let's go.
[50:01.23]It's time to move.
[50:06.19]People are gonna be one.
[50:07.95]Tanks are gonna be two.
[50:10.79]We're running out of time for two minutes.
[50:24.11]No.
[50:34.62]No.
[50:38.04]Yes, sir.
[50:38.78]Very well.
[50:41.14]That's it.
[50:42.12]GG.
[50:43.87]Agreed.
[50:47.38]Don't go in all the way.
[50:48.08]You only got like two health.
[50:55.73]How am I doing on money?
[50:58.07]Go!
[50:58.31]Go!
[51:22.48]Now they have a base.
[51:23.20]I might not be able to take the base out.
[51:25.74]That might be hard.
[51:26.46]Oh shit.
[51:29.66]Oh shit.
[51:30.08]Oh shit.
[51:30.38]Back it up.
[51:30.70]Back it up.
[51:31.00]Back it up.
[51:31.28]Be strategic about this.
[51:33.04]What's up there?
[51:33.80]Alright, they have... We're gonna take out the... I need the tanks.
[51:42.54]Wait.
[51:42.72]Let's wait.
[51:43.16]Let's take out their resources.
[51:53.90]Oh, this is the kick of the fight.
[52:02.65]Medic, get in there!
[52:05.31]Kill the snowplow?
[52:06.25]I can't get in there with these guys.
[52:08.89]Die!
[52:09.21]Come on!
[52:11.57]Yes!
[52:33.10]Don't go in too far.
[52:33.62]Don't go in too far.
[52:34.20]Don't go too far.
[52:38.84]Yes, sir.
[52:39.64]Alright.
[52:40.04]Take it out.
[52:40.80]Can you do it at range?
[52:42.75]Yeah.
[52:44.59]Yes, sir.
[52:46.93]Yes, sir.
[52:49.37]Yes, sir.
[52:54.81]Oh, no.
[52:57.29]Yes, sir.
[52:58.25]Agreed.
[52:59.69]That's OK.
[53:03.03]They're coming in from the start.
[53:08.77]Give me another barracks.
[53:16.98]Oh, shit.
[53:19.82]I'm out of power.
[53:29.11]This guy needs to up his game.
[53:41.00]More.
[53:42.18]Don't let up.
[53:50.69]Fuck this.
[53:51.03]That's all I got.
[53:51.89]Go in.
[53:52.11]Go in with the tanks.
[54:02.06]Uh-oh.
[54:02.44]Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[54:04.02]Back it up.
[54:05.08]That's bad.
[54:10.01]Just take it out, take it out, take it out.
[54:12.05]What else is up here?
[54:13.53]I don't know these fucking things.
[54:15.37]Take out this flame shit.
[54:16.17]And then I can have my infantry actually go in.
[54:26.68]Crush, crush, crush.
[54:29.00]Oh my god.
[54:29.70]Run them over.
[54:30.18]Run them over.
[54:31.04]Run them over.
[54:38.43]Yes!
[54:39.75]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[54:42.23]I need, uh... Yes, sir?
[54:49.70]Meeting orders.
[54:51.01]Report.
[54:51.33]Very well.
[55:07.21]We're gonna run out of resources in a minute.
[55:09.81]There's no more gold to get.
[55:11.11]There's only over here.
[55:11.83]I need money.
[55:19.26]Dick.
[55:20.04]I have to expand.
[55:31.69]I can't expand because I don't have... I can't... There's no more... There's no construction yard.
[55:35.11]I just have to win.
[55:40.38]I'm slowly taking out this shit.
[55:46.38]They don't have much up there.
[55:54.43]Don't!
[55:54.95]Okay, thank god.
[55:56.23]Go.
[56:00.50]I need to make an ore refinery like over here.
[56:07.98]What, okay, what's absolutely, this is not necessary.
[56:11.43]More tanks.
[56:15.05]I need more tanks.
[56:15.83]I need to spend the money on the tanks.
[56:17.09]I can't have a second war factory.
[56:18.23]Okay, they have one tank, and like, yeah, this is over.
[56:26.66]I win.
[56:26.80]Just don't go in yet.
[56:41.52]Sit on the ore field and just keep killing the snowplow.
[56:43.76]Alright, what needs to happen is... I gotta take out this, take out the tank, and then I should win.
[56:50.94]Here we go.
[56:51.30]Where are the tanks?
[56:55.34]Alright, they're just... Why are you going that way?
[57:10.23]God damn it!
[57:11.77]He killed the damn thing!
[57:20.16]No!
[57:20.64]You motherfucker!
[57:22.32]You took the snowball!
[57:25.34]He knew what he was doing!
[57:27.02]He knew what he was doing!
[57:36.57]Send him in!
[57:36.97]Send him in!
[57:37.31]Send him in!
[57:37.73]Everybody!
[57:38.83]Go!
[57:39.07]Go!
[57:39.21]Go!
[57:39.39]Go!
[57:41.66]Who's left?
[57:42.06]Oh shit.
[57:45.00]Don't get in range of that.
[57:49.50]I can do this with one tank.
[57:56.58]Take out the barracks.
[58:13.55]Oh, spam.
[58:14.17]This guy's made of... What the fuck is he made of?
[58:33.67]Oh my god, are you...
[58:44.08]Kill him!
[58:46.76]Vehicle reporting.
[58:57.02]Acknowledge.
[58:57.56]Acknowledge.
[58:58.64]Yes, sir.
[58:58.96]Acknowledge.
[58:59.54]Acknowledge.
[59:00.08]Build a flame tank.
[59:01.32]Acknowledge.
[59:02.36]Acknowledge.
[59:02.90]Don't let him rebuild.
[59:03.78]Go up here.
[59:04.12]Yes, sir.
[59:09.84]No, no, no.
[59:10.16]Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
[59:10.94]Don't go that way.
[59:11.42]Alright, here we go.
[59:12.27]Let's move it.
[59:13.29]Yes, sir.
[59:20.88]Unable to comply.
[59:21.98]Building in progress.
[59:50.49]Just go up.
[59:51.23]Take out the silos.
[59:53.69]You're on run over duty.
[59:56.33]Kill something.
[59:57.71]Don't get in range of that.
[60:20.81]Oh, here comes Snowplough.
[60:23.97]Don't let him run you over.
[60:25.07]Don't let him get... Alright, good.
[60:28.19]Take on the construction yard.
[60:29.97]Where did you get a tank?
[60:31.43]Yes!
[60:50.48]Why are you going up there?
[60:51.18]Why are you going up there?
[60:53.12]They can't build buildings anymore, I win.
[60:56.02]Alright, hold back for a second.
[60:57.43]Oh fuck, he's gonna run away, he's gonna run away!
[61:21.19]I'm gonna win.
[61:21.61]He's gonna kill it, isn't he?
[61:23.67]No, run him over!
[61:50.54]It's over.
[61:52.56]I win.
[61:53.12]You literally cannot win.
[61:54.52]I win.
[61:55.91]Yes, sir.
[61:56.69]Yes, sir.
[62:03.11]Yeah, it's over.
[62:03.75]I win.
[62:19.81]Yeah, at this point, this is annoying.
[62:21.85]Because... Why are you still in the game, man?
[62:24.11]Like, you're gonna ride this... It's over.
[62:25.57]You lost.
[62:26.55]You're gonna stay in the game?
[62:27.49]I have to go around and find the one farm that you built.
[62:32.80]To BM the game.
[62:33.98]What is up here?
[62:36.94]How do you still have the money to do this?
[62:46.73]Oh, I got- a snowplow came over.
[62:48.55]Don't cross this guy's path.
[62:52.40]Don't do that.
[62:53.12]Thank god.
[63:18.09]Kill their buildings!
[63:19.67]Just kill their buildings and it's over.
[63:28.22]Dude, Jerm is gaming like hard right now.
[63:38.11]Yeah, I know.
[63:42.81]I gotta turn this down.
[63:43.67]This shit is so loud.
[63:51.08]Okay, that's better.
[63:55.04]Did he just sell everything?
[63:56.90]Alright, this motherfucker is seriously blaming me.
[63:59.66]He sold everything.
[64:00.50]He sold every building, and you just left with a snowplow.
[64:12.71]Is that actually all you have left?
[64:18.90]Here it comes.
[64:20.02]The final battle.
[64:21.34]Imagine this is the last line of defense in the war.
[64:38.55]You know you're in the snowplow, like what do you do?
[64:48.41]Snowplow VM.
[64:49.69]Yeah, I know, what the fuck?
[65:04.29]Was that me?
[65:05.13]I guess I did that.
[65:10.31]This game's, I love this game.
[65:19.22]157 to 120.
[65:25.30]What building did I lose?
[65:26.28]I lost a building?
[65:33.84]Hmm.
[65:35.18]Alright, this one's into... We're going into Russia.
[65:40.33]Not quite.
[65:41.41]Let's go... Let's go up here.
[65:45.97]Government leaders have abandoned the capital and are now hiding in exile.
[65:50.34]Information out of occupied Athens has been sporadic, but Soviet forces are indeed in control of the capital as well as much of the outlying territories in Greece.
[66:00.18]In the city, fighting among Allied and Soviet troops continues, but the Allied death toll is rising rapidly.
[66:06.44]Now it remains to be seen if Allied forces will be able to weather this onslaught intact.
[66:11.19]What the fuck?
[66:11.75]What?
[66:11.95]Somebody says look at her shoulder pads?
[66:13.45]No.
[66:38.80]Sounds bad, does it not?
[66:40.56]Well, it is.
[66:42.48]But Stalin has just written his obituary.
[66:45.30]At last, this will help us galvanize the rest of the world against him.
[66:50.26]Yes, we have lost Greece.
[66:53.38]But we are not out just yet.
[66:55.34]Stalin may think so.
[66:57.36]But if we can continue to counsel the talents of commanders like yourself, we will come to this war on top.
[67:04.20]My old friend...
[67:11.53]One of Tanya's men.
[67:13.55]She found something.
[67:15.46]Russian security agents have captured her.
[67:18.38]They will almost certainly take her back to Moscow.
[67:23.60]They must get her back.
[67:25.50]She has vital information on the Iron Breton project.
[67:28.18]Did you hear when he put it down?
[67:29.12]That information could help tip the scales in our favor.
[67:36.83]Let him clear his head.
[67:38.55]In this state, he is of no use to us.
[67:44.55]The Soviets currently hold Tanya near Grodno.
[67:48.21]The prison is well guarded.
[67:50.21]With a supply truck from a nearby Soviet base, runs to the facility several times a day.
[67:56.93]If your spies can infiltrate the war factory, they may be able to hitch a ride into the prison compound.
[68:04.24]Once you have found Tanya, get her out of there any way you can.
[68:22.57]Such a pretty face.
[68:26.46]Where is Professor Einstein?
[68:30.56]That was a real spit.
[68:31.38]I was hoping you'd say that.
[68:34.35]Oh!
[68:47.72]Uh-oh, it's a syringe.
[68:51.00]What?
[68:51.22]What is it?
[68:51.58]Blood?
[68:51.92]What is that?
[68:59.16]A syringe.
[68:59.48]There has to be a syringe in every game.
[69:05.31]I'm afraid the effects are quite... permanent.
[69:16.90]Get it away from the eye.
[69:17.80]Oh, I hate this.
[69:24.67]Oh, I hate this.
[69:25.51]Is he stuck in his chest?
[69:40.13]Wait, what?
[69:46.51]Let's go!
[69:47.45]Get Spy into the War Factory.
[69:53.13]War Factory over here.
[69:57.61]Wait, I think the dogs can see through.
[70:01.57]Oh shit!
[70:03.92]Oh shit, a dog is chasing me!
[70:07.10]The dogs can see through your disguise, I remember.
[70:16.39]Alright, get out of the way.
[70:25.99]I gotta get in here.
[70:29.90]Watch out for that dog, watch out for that dog, watch out for that dog, watch out for that dog!
[70:33.58]Watch out for the dog, watch out for the dog!
[70:48.44]What?
[70:51.94]What?
[70:52.52]What about what?
[70:57.50]Didn't I just die?
[70:58.58]Didn't that guy just die?
[71:00.44]Commander, on my way.
[71:09.62]For king and country, on my way.
[71:14.97]Indeed.
[71:15.23]For king and country, on my way.
[71:17.83]Alright, I gotta wait.
[71:18.71]I gotta go, like, now, but I can't.
[71:20.85]I gotta wait.
[71:21.31]This is Hitman.
[71:23.95]Gotta play it like Hitman.
[71:25.04]Okay, there they go.
[71:26.84]They're gonna come up here.
[71:28.26]How far out do these guys go?
[71:35.45]Maybe I should go down.
[71:36.23]They're not gonna see me, right?
[71:54.74]I'm going down.
[71:56.66]Look at that mammoth tank.
[71:57.72]That's the best, that's the best unit in the whole game, by the way.
[72:06.10]Alright, don't, I'm not, just stay here, just stay.
[72:10.96]Stay right here.
[72:14.43]They come up, they come down, then they go this way, and I'm gonna go over here.
[72:18.57]Save it right here.
[72:19.37]Alright, I'm ready.
[72:27.32]Up, and then they come back down.
[72:29.04]Hide up here.
[72:30.68]Stay right there.
[72:33.86]They don't... Please don't save me.
[72:36.86]Right, I'm far enough away.
[72:38.33]Okay.
[72:39.43]Don't move.
[72:41.27]What, did they go down?
[72:43.33]Okay, they go down there.
[72:44.21]Indeed.
[72:45.27]Indeed.
[72:45.77]Indeed.
[72:46.45]Indeed.
[72:47.45]Indeed.
[72:59.57]Get in there!
[73:00.11]I'm in.
[73:05.99]Now what?
[73:06.89]Oh, I'm in the convoy.
[73:07.83]Oh shit, save it here.
[73:12.02]This base is huge.
[73:31.04]Oh.
[73:32.68]Christ.
[73:36.60]Get Tanya to the helicopter.
[73:40.35]Destroy the SAM sites.
[73:41.37]Let's go!
[73:42.65]Tanya!
[73:45.63]What happened to the spy?
[73:57.55]Oh, no.
[73:57.91]The spy's dead.
[74:09.75]Destroy the SAM sites, get Tiny to the helicopter.
[74:15.04]And he gave, he gave his life.
[74:16.68]Alright, I gotta be careful, the dogs can kill you in, in one hit, so.
[74:20.86]There's another dog.
[74:37.31]That's not far so good.
[74:38.79]Helicopters, I don't even know where it is.
[74:46.56]Hold up.
[74:52.72]Shoot!
[74:53.26]What the fuck?
[74:56.06]It was obvious.
[74:57.14]He was a red spy.
[75:01.56]That's very good use of what we just said.
[75:07.87]Oh, shit.
[75:08.59]Is that me?
[75:09.33]I'm getting reinforcements.
[75:12.71]No, that... Just get in the helicopter.
[75:15.60]Did I do it?
[75:39.38]Destroy all units and structures.
[75:43.86]Are you kidding me?
[75:46.78]How the hell am I gonna do this?
[75:53.53]I don't even need a construction site?
[75:58.03]Alright, I have to get an engineer into their construction site here.
[76:03.23]This isn't gonna be fucked up.
[76:11.60]Alright.
[76:12.38]I need to... We gotta do some group dictates and stuff here.
[76:16.64]I want tanks on group one, and I want jeeps and people on group two.
[76:22.17]Group one.
[76:25.09]Get you guys on group two.
[76:28.53]Alright.
[76:30.75]Group one goes in first.
[76:32.73]That's a mammoth tank.
[76:34.71]Let's try to take it out before I can do anything.
[76:39.39]Kill that mammoth tank.
[76:43.64]Oh, fuck.
[76:51.09]Kill it!
[76:55.45]Stay away, stay away, stay away.
[76:56.77]Only Group 1.
[76:57.33]They got dogs.
[77:00.91]Alright, Engineer.
[77:06.11]Get in there.
[77:07.14]Take over the base.
[77:08.46]And then I'll have a construction site.
[77:10.38]If you get an Engineer in any building, they take it over.
[77:13.94]That's not true.
[77:16.76]That's not true at all.
[77:21.31]Oh, right, right.
[77:26.29]You have to damage it.
[77:26.97]You have to damage it all the way.
[77:28.25]Okay, whatever.
[77:29.09]We lost him.
[77:30.53]It has to be all the way almost damaged.
[77:34.59]He's fixing it from the inside.
[77:37.07]What are you doing?
[77:38.25]Stop it!
[77:47.29]Now it's ours.
[77:47.91]Okay, now fix that.
[77:55.38]There we go.
[77:56.00]Now I own this shit.
[77:59.62]Okay.
[78:00.58]I- I- whoops.
[78:02.08]Okay, whoops.
[78:02.62]That was a whoops.
[78:07.86]I didn't capture the War Factory.
[78:09.06]That was a mistake.
[78:09.66]It's okay.
[78:14.03]I'm gonna make a sub-pen.
[78:18.22]Shit, this is bad.
[78:22.22]What are you doing?
[78:23.72]Don't destroy your own fence, you idiot.
[78:30.61]Don't.
[78:31.01]Actually, you know what?
[78:31.75]Take out there.
[78:33.05]Take this out.
[78:35.57]Dog.
[78:37.15]Dog.
[78:46.98]Nobody get yourself killed, please.
[78:51.24]Sub pen's going in here.
[78:53.58]And then I can probably go around.
[78:55.53]We'll find out.
[79:00.49]Warp back.
[79:00.89]Sub pen.
[79:01.27]Let's do it.
[79:03.57]I need an engineer.
[79:04.31]I wonder if I can make engineers.
[79:06.09]Get out.
[79:12.39]Get out.
[79:13.55]Get out.
[79:16.84]Tesla coils.
[79:17.83]Fuck.
[79:18.15]Alright, let's do a submarine.
[79:29.80]Wait a minute.
[79:30.18]Hold on.
[79:30.52]Is this... Does the water go down here?
[79:38.72]Stay up here.
[79:39.43]Stay up here.
[79:39.85]Don't go down that way.
[79:45.26]Did I just waste like a thousand?
[79:46.58]I think I just wasted a bunch of money.
[79:55.56]No, it's good.
[79:56.26]It goes... Yeah, I wasted a bunch of money.
[80:04.11]Oh well.
[80:05.79]Oh well.
[80:07.93]Barracks.
[80:08.27]Let's get this right in.
[80:09.83]Let's do this like down here.
[80:12.43]Engineer.
[80:12.83]Here we go.
[80:13.31]This stuff is all mine now.
[80:14.59]All mine.
[80:18.06]In fact, get everybody out of the way and blow this up.
[80:19.88]Sell the deal.
[80:22.00]Destroy everything.
[80:23.24]I will.
[80:25.34]Did you seriously kill him?
[80:28.40]No!
[80:28.80]No!
[80:52.00]It didn't hit him?
[80:53.88]Alright, I need to repair you.
[80:55.76]Come here.
[80:57.24]How do we repair?
[81:00.41]Did it?
[81:00.65]The fucking service depot just exploded.
[81:02.71]God damn it.
[81:03.55]Oh shit, they're coming in.
[81:05.29]I think I'm gonna lose.
[81:16.09]This nigga's gonna lose.
[81:17.33]I'm gonna lose.
[81:18.17]Oh my god, no!
[81:19.81]No, when did I last save it?
[81:21.93]When did I save it?
[81:26.89]God damn it!
[81:31.02]When did I save it?
[81:32.30]Just load it, I don't care.
[81:35.42]Okay, yeah, what a disaster that was.
[81:37.14]We're not fucking doing that.
[81:55.17]Kill the tank.
[82:00.81]Get out of there, Engineer.
[82:06.36]You seriously can't hit the dog?
[82:08.78]How bad are you guys?
[82:10.38]Alright, we're good.
[82:13.22]Now.
[82:13.60]Watch it, watch it, watch it.
[82:18.80]Kill the dogs, kill the dogs, kill the dogs!
[82:21.74]Kill the dogs!
[82:29.66]Don't turn yellow.
[82:30.82]Don't turn yellow.
[82:33.65]Don't turn yellow.
[83:03.32]Why are the engineers on the front line?
[83:06.00]I don't know.
[83:06.42]But I have to get them out quick now.
[83:11.50]Engineer.
[83:14.40]Hurry up, so I can get this done.
[83:19.30]Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[83:23.36]Let's take the service depot first.
[83:26.89]Oh my god.
[83:28.49]I didn't think it was going to destroy the whole thing.
[83:32.80]It did get killed instantly.
[83:34.78]I thought I was going to at least... There was three barrels.
[83:42.02]Yes, sir.
[83:44.13]Yes, sir.
[83:45.51]Yes, sir.
[83:46.55]Yes, sir.
[83:47.53]Awaiting orders.
[83:49.25]Yes, sir.
[83:51.27]Get in there.
[83:54.77]Yes, sir.
[83:55.15]Stop shooting it.
[84:01.78]No, fuck the oil refinery.
[84:02.88]Give me another barracks.
[84:03.50]Okay, I need engineers.
[84:11.40]Give me another barracks.
[84:15.84]Capture the snowplow.
[84:16.82]I can't.
[84:21.40]Grenade?
[84:22.60]A grenader.
[84:24.21]Grenader.
[84:26.57]What is this guy doing?
[84:28.03]Get the fuck out of here.
[84:29.47]Alright, get on the... just defend.
[84:39.20]Give me another barracks.
[84:40.86]No, that's overkill.
[84:42.02]Super overkill.
[84:42.80]Stop.
[84:48.46]Stop.
[84:48.74]Don't go that far.
[84:49.50]What are you doing?
[84:50.28]Okay.
[84:53.22]Okay.
[85:04.82]Don't just go attack it.
[85:06.52]That's bad of you.
[85:13.36]Oh yeah, you can repair.
[85:15.35]Right, right, right.
[85:16.21]That's instant repair.
[85:17.41]Yeah, you're right.
[85:18.33]You're right.
[85:19.57]I don't even want this one.
[85:20.71]I'm not going to take it over.
[85:21.47]I'll just replace it.
[85:22.21]I don't care.
[85:27.13]It's probably cheaper for me to replace this.
[85:38.27]Let's get dogs.
[85:39.47]I'm gonna get like 50 dogs.
[85:43.44]More.
[86:08.47]I need money.
[86:09.07]I need money.
[86:09.55]I need money.
[86:10.31]I need money.
[86:11.11]I need money.
[86:13.81]Don't do that.
[86:14.77]I don't have a refinery.
[86:25.48]Okay.
[86:25.76]I have so many dog kennels.
[86:28.66]So, plan A is see if I can wrap around this way.
[86:33.20]To take out, because these Tesla coils, the flame tower, it's going to be a shitshow.
[86:42.47]I still have... Alright, we got dogs.
[86:44.32]Okay.
[86:47.46]Plan B is go... Oh, they have those things.
[86:50.82]What is it?
[86:51.56]The V-Rockets?
[86:55.14]Just go wrap Main Street.
[86:56.00]It's the other play.
[86:56.63]But that's a horrible idea.
[86:57.73]I'm gonna go... You know what?
[87:00.11]The transport actually doesn't sound like such a terrible idea now.
[87:03.19]Because I could just put people in them and then bring them down here without... No, what a mistake that would be.
[87:08.03]Alright, this guy's almost dead.
[87:09.86]Go scout over here.
[87:10.58]See what's over here.
[87:16.97]Go to these so you don't get killed.
[87:19.40]Alright.
[87:21.14]Go this way.
[87:23.94]No, no, no, no, no.
[87:25.38]I can admit it here.
[87:29.26]I could just launch a... I'm going for it.
[87:38.19]He sees me.
[87:38.59]He sees me.
[87:38.97]Come on, get it done.
[87:39.83]Get it done!
[87:42.05]Yes!
[87:43.57]Mission complete.
[87:44.49]You did a good job.
[87:50.87]It's alright.
[87:51.23]Here comes the retaliation.
[87:52.51]That's fine with me.
[88:03.42]Oh, fuck.
[88:04.32]Here come the rockets.
[88:04.88]Here come the... This is bad, bad, bad.
[88:05.94]These things kill everything.
[88:07.26]Kill these before they do anything.
[88:09.95]Don't get too close.
[88:18.41]Back it up.
[88:19.03]Oh!
[88:21.96]Okay, we're alright.
[88:22.80]I gotta take off those fucking Tesla coils.
[88:26.94]Kill it.
[88:49.59]I don't have the power to do this.
[88:51.01]I gotta go around this way.
[88:53.93]In fact, you know what?
[88:55.11]Just get over here.
[88:58.57]Get this way.
[88:59.95]Don't activate the Tesla coil.
[89:01.39]Just wrap around.
[89:02.53]Because we're going down.
[89:07.31]These flame towers are not as deadly as the Tesla coils.
[89:12.37]Okay, good.
[89:14.56]Good.
[89:14.94]Good.
[89:21.42]Get in.
[89:21.94]Oh, fuck.
[89:31.20]All the dogs just died.
[89:32.67]I didn't even realize they were even here.
[89:39.87]Where are you going?
[89:41.09]Where are you going?
[89:47.79]Just get across the bridge.
[89:51.15]What the fuck are you going?
[89:52.89]I think I'm going to go all the way around the long way.
[89:56.78]That should be good.
[90:01.64]Yes, sir.
[90:01.98]Agreed.
[90:03.28]Very well.
[90:06.28]At once.
[90:08.04]Ready and waiting.
[90:10.10]Yes, sir.
[90:13.19]We're good.
[90:14.01]Keep going.
[90:23.00]Why did he explode?
[90:29.24]Stay in the base.
[90:30.42]These guys are just gonna be a pain in the ass.
[90:42.37]Sorry.
[90:43.25]These guys are flamethrower troopers.
[90:45.25]Oh shit.
[90:49.34]Alright, slowly take them out.
[90:50.82]Take out their resources, take out their bullshit.
[90:53.68]Power.
[90:54.10]Focus on that first.
[90:57.16]I'm out of money.
[91:04.97]Shit, take out the power.
[91:11.21]Alright, I did what I wanted to do.
[91:12.59]More power, take it out.
[91:20.46]I got an ore truck, right?
[91:22.16]Yes, sir.
[91:22.60]Get over there.
[91:24.65]Where's my other... Okay, good, you're good, you're good, you're good, good, good, good, good, good.
[91:27.89]Don't leave the base unguarded.
[91:29.05]Okay, good.
[91:34.51]I gotta take out this thing, but I don't wanna... These are all grenaders.
[91:40.03]Fuck, I have no money.
[91:46.30]How much is... 1,400 bucks.
[91:48.16]Give me another tank.
[91:48.78]Two tanks.
[92:00.33]Alright, the grenades are actually awesome.
[92:01.57]Do they have- DUN!
[92:02.14]Run them over!
[92:02.98]Okay, do they have enough power to use the Tesla coil?
[92:06.66]Hello?
[92:06.90]What the hell was that?
[92:09.12]What the hell was that?
[92:10.92]What's going on?
[92:15.19]Alright, I need to do a test.
[92:16.09]No, don't do that.
[92:17.03]That's a bad idea.
[92:36.13]What happened to the music?
[92:42.25]The lack of music.
[92:45.33]Who is being shot at down here?
[92:47.47]Alright, this is freaking me out.
[92:49.07]Oh, they have a plane.
[92:50.57]It's planes.
[92:52.75]They're just doing these... Oh, that's not good.
[92:57.08]That's a pain in the ass.
[92:57.90]I need a... Give me a silo.
[93:09.92]No music makes it serious.
[93:11.68]It is serious.
[93:15.02]No, they have power!
[93:22.47]Shit, that's bad.
[93:24.19]That's very bad.
[93:25.61]Kill it!
[93:27.01]Kill it before... I get it.
[93:35.00]We're doing tanks only.
[93:36.70]I need only tanks.
[93:38.72]In fact...
[93:43.52]Where are the other resources down here?
[93:45.04]This shit.
[93:45.95]Get away from me.
[93:50.79]Oh, you fucking motherfucker.
[93:54.27]I am so angry at that.
[93:55.91]Only tanks.
[93:56.51]Tanks only.
[93:56.95]Let's go.
[94:01.68]Those anti-infantry things.
[94:03.32]Alright, keep going.
[94:04.30]Another war factory.
[94:07.84]So this goes faster.
[94:10.23]This will be worth it.
[94:10.83]I'm rolling into the tanks.
[94:22.12]I actually probably can do some... I'm not going to do it, but I probably could take out some more shit down here.
[94:27.28]Make a radar dome?
[94:28.78]I will after the second war factory.
[94:30.30]You're not even doing... You're just being annoying.
[94:34.31]You're not even doing anything.
[94:38.23]Bad strategist.
[94:41.47]Yeah, I know.
[94:42.27]I'm pretty bad.
[94:43.29]So you can build your own rocket trucks.
[94:47.92]I don't think I can do that.
[94:48.70]Can I do that?
[94:49.24]Oh, no, that's right.
[94:49.90]This is Soviet, right?
[94:51.48]Yeah.
[94:56.66]Okay.
[94:58.50]Now... That's better.
[95:02.52]Let's make a bunch of light tanks.
[95:04.06]Kill it!
[95:30.01]Okay, radar dome.
[95:31.90]It's a thousand bucks.
[95:32.82]I need another ore truck.
[95:41.20]They're almost, they almost have all the ore.
[95:44.30]And then they're dead because the only other ore is over here.
[95:47.46]Okay.
[95:59.44]I think it's worth- I think I'm done.
[96:01.74]I have a lot of tanks.
[96:03.98]They don't have- I mean, they have these rocket things, but shit.
[96:08.48]I'm out of resources.
[96:13.97]Take out this snowplow.
[96:16.71]You know what?
[96:20.11]Kill this thing!
[96:20.83]Just kill it!
[96:24.07]Get the Tesla coils!
[96:25.07]Get them!
[96:26.65]Hurry!
[96:33.20]I'm dead.
[96:33.78]I lose.
[96:35.10]I just, like, aggro'd everything.
[96:39.80]Yeah, I must have killed one Tesla Coil.
[96:42.84]Um, it's over.
[96:43.57]I'm dead.
[96:43.87]I don't have any money.
[96:45.37]I have zero dollars now.
[96:49.11]Ugh, fuck.
[96:57.73]At least the Tesla Coil is gone.
[96:59.23]So this thing can actually ore.
[97:04.20]You guys are such a pain in the ass.
[97:05.16]This is what happens when you fight mighty Russia.
[97:16.93]Kill the harvester.
[97:18.07]I can't.
[97:18.91]If I do that, I aggro the whole camp.
[97:24.31]And they have a rocket guy right here.
[97:27.93]I'm so screwed.
[97:31.33]Not so mighty.
[97:37.61]I would just take the bridge out, but I need to use this bridge.
[97:39.47]Alright, I'm going to park my guys here.
[97:44.13]War truck, hurry up.
[97:48.41]I can destroy the bridge, but I don't want to go down here.
[97:51.01]I'd like to keep going through here.
[97:52.15]Alright, make this thing's life a living hell.
[97:55.42]Cut him off.
[98:02.80]Yes, sir.
[98:03.28]You're harassing me.
[98:04.66]Stop it.
[98:07.71]Kill the bridge?
[98:08.83]Not yet.
[98:10.41]I need this bridge.
[98:12.90]Wait, destroy the bridge and then put transport- get transports.
[98:17.42]That's a great idea actually.
[98:28.91]How can you guys suck that much that you can't shoot that one?
[98:33.46]Yeah, fuck it.
[98:34.84]Let's go.
[98:35.14]Destroy it.
[98:36.08]Cut off the resources.
[98:37.60]Can I?
[98:38.06]Yep.
[98:38.42]Do it.
[98:39.82]You ain't got shit now.
[98:48.27]Do it.
[98:48.59]Kill it.
[98:48.99]You're not going to let this little shit kill you, are you?
[99:04.84]Okay, I have two ore trucks.
[99:06.26]Fuck.
[99:09.18]Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[99:10.58]No, no, no, no!
[99:12.18]God damn it!
[99:13.24]Why didn't it get destroyed?
[99:14.56]And now here, this thing's gonna stay.
[99:20.18]And now I have no money.
[99:21.93]Ah!
[99:22.01]I'm gonna eat up every resource.
[99:30.13]Why did this bridge not get destroyed?
[99:37.82]Let me do my stupid thing.
[99:39.26]Do I need- I need- No, I don't.
[99:51.13]Heavy tank versus heavy tank.
[99:57.16]I got the jump on him.
[99:57.80]I got the first shot.
[99:58.44]I win.
[100:27.47]I think I might have to restart.
[100:28.37]I have to restart.
[100:33.19]I'm not going to have enough money to do this.
[100:37.16]I shouldn't have even made the save.
[100:38.36]You know what happened?
[100:39.46]When I destroyed the service depot, that fucking tanked the whole game.
[100:46.24]I might be alright.
[101:17.05]Actually, don't even destroy the bridge.
[101:18.09]These things are so fucking annoying.
[101:21.53]They're just not even... They're toys.
[101:26.33]What do they have?
[101:30.95]Just drown them.
[101:35.69]Oh!
[101:40.23]Alright, I fucked up their resources.
[101:50.80]Nice miss, idiot.
[102:01.80]They have so much shit over here.
[102:03.72]Yes, sir.
[102:05.22]No, pull it back.
[102:05.98]Pull it back.
[102:06.39]Pull it back.
[102:06.75]Don't do it.
[102:07.11]Don't do it.
[102:07.81]I'm just trying to just bleed them out their resources.
[102:21.45]Good.
[102:23.76]Take their refinery.
[102:27.20]They don't have... That's alright.
[102:28.10]They don't have... They have no trucks.
[102:30.18]Here comes a truck, and it's dead.
[102:33.46]Control supply.
[102:34.92]And you won't have to worry.
[102:36.47]Control supply.
[102:43.55]They're not going to have any money left.
[102:48.69]You're really going to let that happen, right?
[102:54.54]You destroyed- I needed that for- oh my god.
[102:58.08]Just kill it.
[102:58.70]Stop.
[102:59.30]Where do you think it's going?
[103:01.06]You can't go over here.
[103:20.66]Oh, it has to go all the way around.
[103:21.88]Now check this out.
[103:23.38]I'm gonna make turrets.
[103:25.48]Don't aggro everybody!
[103:34.79]Dammit, man.
[103:35.75]I'm so angry right now.
[103:39.24]The stupid-ass V2 rocket blew the bridge up and it fucked up my whole plan.
[103:48.58]How is this still alive?
[103:51.36]What?
[103:51.70]Kill it!
[103:52.98]Now I have to go in the front goddamn door.
[104:16.80]I gotta take out everyth- Alright, I need- I need a- Okay, that thing- Every time I hear that noise, I get fucking mad.
[104:25.68]What do I- I need money.
[104:31.91]They have more than me.
[104:33.25]They don't have any money though, so just keep- just bleed them out completely.
[104:37.65]Can I make, like, SAM sites?
[104:38.73]Not yet.
[104:39.01]Let me make a radar though.
[104:42.79]They're not gonna attack.
[104:44.06]These guys suck.
[104:50.88]Imagine getting stabbed.
[104:52.52]What?
[104:56.20]The plane attacks cost them nothing.
[104:58.06]Okay, good.
[104:58.62]Here comes another truck that thinks it's going to actually do anything over here.
[105:03.30]It's not.
[105:04.06]Does it wait?
[105:04.34]Okay.
[105:04.44]V2 rocket, make one.
[105:31.64]Alright.
[105:32.24]Good luck ever having any money ever again.
[105:36.92]I think I can actually reach the... Yeah, I'm gonna get two of these.
[105:41.62]I'm gonna take out the Tesla coil in one shot.
[105:45.98]These things are just smoking.
[105:50.58]Okay.
[105:52.46]I got two V2 rockets.
[105:54.34]I got a bunch of tanks.
[105:56.80]Not quite ready.
[105:58.16]I will be very soon.
[105:59.05]Let's get some infantry.
[106:02.73]I don't have any... I can't... Okay, let's get like 10.
[106:15.62]I missed the spy.
[106:16.48]Alright, here comes the truck.
[106:22.77]Good luck.
[106:23.65]He ain't gonna get over here.
[106:25.09]Got some infantry.
[106:30.72]Okay, alright.
[106:31.77]I'm going for it.
[106:32.53]I'm gonna go for it.
[106:33.03]We're going Tesla Coil.
[106:33.85]Kill Tesla Coil.
[106:35.37]Save it right here.
[106:37.11]Save this as something else.
[106:43.45]Because... Yeah, watch this shit.
[106:49.44]Why would you shoot?
[106:51.58]You're not even shooting at anything!
[106:55.00]I need those rockets loaded for when I take out the...
[107:09.01]These two V2 rockets have to shoot this and kill it.
[107:11.75]Alright, I'm going one more heavy tank and we're going in.
[107:16.75]Game over, here it goes.
[107:18.87]I'm ready for this.
[107:19.43]V2 rockets.
[107:21.67]Here we go.
[107:21.97]What are you doing?!
[107:22.59]What are you doing?! !
[107:38.19]What are you doing?
[107:39.99]What are you doing?
[107:41.33]What are you doing?
[107:42.99]Why did you not?
[107:44.43]What?
[107:47.97]Sorry, we don't even need it.
[107:48.93]Don't even need it.
[107:51.15]Yes, sir.
[107:52.73]Take it out.
[107:57.45]Yes, sir.
[108:01.38]Awaiting orders.
[108:02.28]Awaiting orders.
[108:05.06]Awaiting orders.
[108:07.16]Awaiting orders.
[108:09.28]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[108:14.72]Here it goes, here it goes, here it comes, here it comes, here it comes.
[108:18.73]Kill this.
[108:19.23]It's a standoff, it's okay.
[108:26.33]Alright, let's go, go!
[108:41.17]Yeah, I got any money motherfucker you can't do shit I
[109:21.11]Take out their war factory.
[109:25.51]That's all I care about.
[109:26.27]Who cares?
[109:26.77]Everything else is fine.
[109:27.57]Go.
[109:27.89]Get it.
[109:35.54]That's it.
[109:36.30]Game over.
[109:36.62]I win.
[109:38.82]Alright.
[109:42.38]I didn't win yet.
[109:52.74]This game is low-key cute.
[109:56.06]Yeah, I mean, sure.
[109:58.58]Alright, don't let up.
[110:00.37]Don't let up.
[110:00.79]Power.
[110:01.13]Get rid of power.
[110:07.43]Make a Sam site?
[110:09.43]I can't even make a Sam site.
[110:10.78]No, I win.
[110:12.44]This was intense.
[110:13.26]I almost lost.
[110:22.40]Did you make your own annoying pew-pew sounds?
[110:31.37]What?
[110:31.83]Nice.
[110:35.03]I'm so glad I did the bleed him dry tactic.
[110:50.17]Build an airfield.
[110:51.63]I mean, I got this in the back.
[110:53.13]Actually, no, I don't.
[110:55.89]That's not confirmed.
[110:58.31]Do silos do it?
[111:05.46]No, I don't even need a silo.
[111:06.24]It took 75 minutes.
[111:06.68]It did not take 75 minutes.
[111:20.05]It didn't take 75 minutes.
[111:21.71]I've only been streaming for two hours.
[111:23.27]It didn't take... It didn't take... No, it did not.
[111:26.97]It did not take 75 minutes.
[111:28.57]No, it did not.
[111:29.65]I refuse to believe that.
[111:31.57]It didn't take 75 minutes!
[111:37.37]Alright, this thing's all dead.
[111:48.88]He's in denial.
[111:50.50]Are you serious?
[111:51.72]Where'd you get the money to build this?
[111:53.16]He's in denial.
[111:53.88]It did not take that long to build this.
[111:56.64]It didn't take that long.
[111:57.95]Get everybody in the right spot.
[111:59.19]Okay, cool.
[111:59.41]Take it out.
[112:22.48]See, that's the play, is you sell it before it gets destroyed.
[112:25.34]Yeah, that's it.
[112:28.82]You'll never take me alive.
[112:51.99]This Soviet base is dummy thick.
[112:58.99]I don't know why I read that.
[113:01.23]I don't know.
[113:01.93]Why do I read anything?
[113:09.50]Can't think of war trucks?
[113:11.62]Oh, you mean coming?
[113:12.24]Yeah, let's go.
[113:16.69]Awaiting orders.
[113:20.93]This base is huge.
[113:28.71]What a giant ass base.
[113:29.99]Let's go.
[113:31.15]That's it.
[113:36.92]Some of you go this way.
[113:38.98]What the fuck was that?
[114:05.26]Now I have to kill these.
[114:09.66]You go over there and deal with that.
[114:19.04]You guys take that out.
[114:20.90]Now I just have to kill every unit.
[114:23.58]Yuck.
[114:39.62]That was technically a unit.
[114:46.24]Tanya is safe.
[114:46.91]You can go home.
[114:49.03]Did we hit 80 minutes?
[114:51.29]It's not been 80 minutes.
[115:01.29]I'm about to go look at the VOD.
[115:03.42]I'm going to my VOD right now and I'm going to see.
[115:15.82]That's it.
[115:17.94]They're not even fighting back.
[115:22.02]Wait, I thought we got Titania out.
[115:26.14]Wait, would Titania not get out?
[115:28.02]Wait, did... Oh, that's me.
[115:35.26]That's the spy.
[115:57.23]They get cut off so quickly.
[115:59.77]I want to see what happens.
[116:07.75]One hour and 18 minutes.
[116:11.47]Oh shit, it's actually been 80 minutes.
[116:17.58]No, it hasn't.
[116:19.39]But I... That was a hard mission.
[116:23.85]But remember, I had to infiltrate the base and escape with Tanya.
[116:28.19]That's also included in that time.
[116:31.42]That was two different missions together.
[116:32.98]Alright, I'm going down.
[116:38.32]Excellent work, Commander.
[116:41.18]The information Tanya recovered has proved invaluable.
[116:46.15]Would you not agree, Stavros?
[116:47.35]This is on normal difficulty.
[116:49.77]Yes.
[116:51.65]Our analysis is almost complete.
[116:54.35]No, no, no.
[116:55.08]Sit.
[116:55.76]Sit.
[116:57.44]I'm late.
[116:58.72]I apologize.
[116:59.64]It's Albert Einstein.
[117:01.26]My watch is not working.
[117:04.76]Professor Einstein, this is an honor.
[117:09.00]General Nikos Stavros.
[117:10.31]Yes.
[117:11.53]Professor, let me introduce the commander who rescued you.
[117:14.03]This is the only clothes that Albert Einstein ever wore, apparently.
[117:17.31]This is Professor Albert Einstein.
[117:19.45]Yes, yes.
[117:20.81]Very exciting.
[117:22.86]He's always in this, like, I'm in my brown vest and brown jacket.
[117:28.90]These are reconnaissance photos taken in the FGNC.
[117:31.18]There are no photos of him in pajamas.
[117:33.70]Professor, perhaps you can help us identify the specifics?
[117:37.27]Yes.
[117:39.13]From what I've had a chance to read, this is Stalin's main research laboratory.
[117:45.81]Why would there be?
[117:46.55]They are working on a new kind of defensive system.
[117:54.06]He doesn't look like Einstein, does he?
[117:56.12]This is it.
[117:56.86]It's just messy, bald, gray head with mustache.
[118:00.08]It's based on the theory of resonating molecules.
[118:04.15]Well, yes, Professor, but...
[118:07.10]what does the iron curtain do do well by the theorem it appears to make things invulnerable any vehicle or structure covered with this effect this guy is dead now will be impervious to harm yes Albert Einstein is incredible Albert Einstein is dead yes I know Tesla was experimenting with this kind of professor that is all we need to know
[118:37.90]Soviet research on this device cannot be allowed to continue.
[118:40.73]Destroy it.
[118:42.71]What else do we know about this research facility, Stavros?
[118:44.41]The guy on the left is kind of fucked up.
[118:46.49]He's not talking, he just like runs away.
[118:48.02]Because... Put your personal losses aside for a moment, will you?
[118:51.44]Yes, of course.
[118:53.40]Besides R&D functions, this base also serves as a waypoint for Soviet submarine actions, so it is heavily populated.
[119:02.73]As far as we can tell, the only prototype they have of this Iron Curtain is located here.
[119:08.39]We do not know if it is operational yet.
[119:11.65]Commander, your task is simple.
[119:14.66]Get into that base, infiltrate their laboratories, and destroy all information and prototypes of this...
[119:23.59]Iron Curtain.
[119:27.31]Here we go.
[119:28.59]Alright, I'm gonna play this one smart.
[119:33.03]This is one of the harder missions I looked up.
[119:35.87]I saw it on the Wikipedia.
[119:37.33]It said this is the mission that's very hard.
[119:38.83]Let's make this good.
[119:40.98]Okay, go.
[119:55.75]Get it going.
[119:56.19]Alright.
[119:59.72]Before I do anything... Is there actually an attack move?
[120:06.98]Because I can't seem to get it to work.
[120:08.20]I don't think there is not.
[120:10.06]What is it?
[120:14.84]No, you can just move them where you want and then press G to put them on area guard.
[120:19.22]Okay.
[120:21.82]So it's G. You just have to move them somewhere and press G.
[120:25.22]There is no attack move in Red Alert.
[120:27.28]That's all I need to know.
[120:28.62]So just be... G, go.
[120:29.84]Okay.
[120:35.10]In fact, you know what?
[120:35.66]Stop moving.
[120:36.34]Stop moving now.
[120:37.14]Get up there.
[120:37.64]Start scouting.
[120:38.20]G. How big is this map?
[120:39.18]Pretty big.
[120:39.60]Okay.
[120:56.05]Take it out.
[120:59.09]Don't get in range of them.
[121:00.51]Gee.
[121:02.51]Don't sneak up there.
[121:03.63]Stay back.
[121:04.63]How we doing?
[121:07.45]Define rate.
[121:08.25]Get it up.
[121:11.71]Radar don't.
[121:12.19]Hurry.
[121:18.73]Don't, don't, don't, don't attack.
[121:19.65]Don't, don't!
[121:20.65]You idiot.
[121:21.43]Sorry.
[121:21.73]No, no, no, no.
[121:22.35]It's just guarding.
[121:22.93]G. Scout this way.
[121:28.94]This is a GTA V sized map.
[121:30.78]There are some maps in this game that are huge.
[121:32.08]They can have up to eight players play them.
[121:33.50]That was a spy plane.
[121:42.19]I gotta start to build up.
[121:44.66]I don't have very much room.
[121:50.62]Alright.
[121:50.92]Power plant.
[121:51.34]I don't have any room.
[121:53.06]I'm out of room.
[121:53.62]I don't have any room.
[121:54.35]I don't have any room to build.
[122:00.33]Oh, shit.
[122:00.91]This is bad.
[122:01.53]Okay.
[122:03.35]I need a barracks.
[122:10.69]Stay here and guard.
[122:11.45]Stay back.
[122:11.95]You guys go front.
[122:13.21]Gee.
[122:13.57]Oh, shit.
[122:13.93]Get over here.
[122:14.47]Stop moving and shoot!
[122:17.35]What are you doing?
[122:18.91]Why do you do this?
[122:40.40]Oh, fuck.
[122:41.42]This is very bad.
[122:42.22]I have no room.
[122:44.45]Ready and waiting.
[122:50.85]Spy.
[122:57.16]Oh, fuck.
[123:00.78]Ooh.
[123:02.02]Ooh.
[123:03.42]Spy, get in there.
[123:04.44]Indeed, indeed.
[123:06.32]For king and country.
[123:09.01]I need rocket soldiers to prevent that from happening.
[123:10.59]Why did I just make two spies?
[123:16.60]I just panicked.

[124:46.10]Otherwise, you're guaranteed to lose.
[124:50.33]Enemy tech center.
[124:53.33]That's not up there.
[124:53.95]Alright, I'm dead.
[124:55.19]It's over.
[124:56.69]It's over.

[125:50.18]Move your MCV past the base.
[125:52.62]Because I don't know what they have up here.
[125:54.71]They might kill it before it gets up there.
[126:00.13]Wait, let me check that.
[126:01.81]This is just a death mission.
[126:03.51]And then we go up here and kill this ship.
[126:05.62]Let me see.
[126:06.10]Maybe it actually would be better up here.
[126:15.89]Let's see what's going on over here.
[126:20.05]Yeah, and put it right there.
[126:23.87]Alright, okay.

[127:13.22]Alright, let's put you guys here.
[127:19.78]Can they fire from that far away?
[127:21.16]Barracks.
[127:24.59]I'm gonna put the barracks right in, we can start feeding out people.
[127:28.65]I need infantry.
[127:33.90]And then rocket soldiers.
[127:34.78]Like five infantry.
[127:35.72]Let's go.
[127:36.28]Let's take these guys this way because they're useless over here.
[127:48.72]Why am I not making buildings?
[127:49.74]What are you talking about?
[127:50.62]I just made three.
[127:54.36]Pillboxes.
[127:54.96]I know, I know.
[127:55.36]And it's after they aura find me.
[127:56.50]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[128:00.73]Go, go, go.
[128:01.17]Just do it now.
[128:04.49]Can these guys, like, volley anything over here?
[128:11.88]Two pillboxes.
[128:12.50]Nothing over there.
[128:17.98]You can't just, like, shoot over it.
[128:19.68]Alright, what about down this way?
[128:24.81]Turret.
[128:28.35]These guys are useless now.
[128:29.51]But they could be okay.
[128:30.25]Okay.
[128:34.82]I don't want to spend... I need two thousand dollars.
[128:36.84]Let's put the, uh... I'm gonna say right in the middle, like right here.
[128:45.16]Okay, refinery.
[128:47.68]I'm out of power.
[128:48.48]Fuck.
[128:53.25]Low power.
[128:53.85]Get spy into the tech center.
[128:55.13]It's probably down here.
[128:57.29]Refinery, get it up.
[129:09.75]Jesus.
[129:11.63]Oh, you dickhead.
[129:13.41]I gotta spread these guys out because the grenades are gonna kill them all.
[129:23.66]Okay, looks good.
[129:40.24]Yes, sir.
[129:45.23]Alright, give me the refinery.
[129:53.05]Uh... War Factory.
[129:54.68]Now.
[129:59.56]Look at his multitasking.
[130:00.62]Yes, sir.
[130:02.08]It's actually pretty awful, but, you know, I'll take the compliment.
[130:04.25]Thank you.
[130:10.93]At least I'm seeing where I'm going.
[130:12.85]Yes, sir.
[130:13.31]Just take them both this way.
[130:14.75]What am I going to use that thing for?
[130:20.27]Alright, looking good.
[130:22.82]War Factory is almost done.
[130:25.00]Yes, sir.
[130:29.50]Yes, sir.
[130:32.73]How we doing?
[130:34.42]Uh... Where should I put the War Factory?
[130:35.94]Probably up here.
[130:45.82]Don't even give me a chance.
[130:46.94]Alright.
[130:48.56]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[130:49.73]Easy.
[130:54.69]Don't go too far out.
[130:55.61]Don't go too far out.
[130:56.35]Stay back to the pillboxes.
[130:57.37]Somebody just gave a bunch of money.
[131:05.04]KXZ just mega-chaired, gave 5,000 bits, and shared rewards with people.
[131:11.20]What was that?
[131:14.14]Thank you, KXZ.
[131:15.64]There's no message.
[131:16.84]It's just a huge amount of money.
[131:17.92]Thank you so much.
[131:19.38]For the fucking ridiculous money drop.
[131:26.36]What's the sharing... What's that thing do?
[131:28.36]Alright, let's do light tank.
[131:39.20]Okay.
[131:39.48]What's that noise?
[131:40.28]I just heard the Tesla coil boot up.
[131:43.56]Do they have Tesla coils over here?
[131:45.02]Dude, where the fuck is the ore?
[132:16.00]Dude!
[132:17.46]But really though, where's the ore?
[132:27.63]We gotta get- we can move forward.
[132:29.81]Alright, a couple more light tanks and we're gonna take this part over.
[132:32.35]And I'm gonna make an engineer or two.
[132:33.77]I'm gonna steal some stuff.
[132:37.79]So I can continue to build.
[132:42.74]In fact...
[132:45.85]Let's go.
[133:00.70]Hold on, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up.
[133:04.18]Tanks.
[133:04.50]What do they got?
[133:07.25]Nothing.
[133:08.23]They got a bunch of junk over here.
[133:10.93]Tanks, take this out so you don't get sprayed.
[133:16.57]You're supposed to be getting far enough away where you don't get sprayed.
[133:31.12]Get in.
[133:34.18]Where's my engineer?
[133:44.69]Take that radar dome, that's ours.
[133:51.20]God damn it.
[133:51.91]Don't, no, no, no.
[133:52.97]No, you, no, I don't want this.
[133:54.29]I don't want this.
[133:58.21]It's okay.
[133:58.52]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[134:00.24]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[134:01.76]Just kill him.
[134:28.85]My uncle's a pro, he said to suck.
[134:35.94]Why do I care about what your uncle has to say about how I play Command and Conquer?
[134:39.70]Alright, where's my engineer?
[134:42.57]Where'd he go?
[134:43.07]Come here.
[134:57.14]Alright.
[134:58.16]I got a free radar dome.
[134:59.61]They don't even want to repair it.
[135:04.65]They know I'm taking it.
[135:06.93]Okay, now what?
[135:12.27]Now I got all this space.
[135:13.53]I have... I need power.
[135:14.61]Okay.
[135:16.27]Sounds good.
[135:20.77]My uncle knows that guy's uncle and he said that you suck.
[135:27.37]Wait, you're making this up!
[135:30.15]Alright, this is up above us.
[135:36.45]What's down?
[135:37.19]More ore?
[135:38.55]Let's just check it, make sure there's nothing over here, make sure it's not bullshit.
[135:44.92]Jerma's just figuring out that people lie to him.
[135:46.76]No, I know that.
[135:47.94]Look at him.
[135:48.54]Dopey.
[135:54.59]Alright.
[135:55.13]New base.
[135:55.61]New operations.
[135:57.05]They cannot come over here now.
[135:59.39]So I can take my time.
[136:01.49]So don't get this wrong.
[136:02.69]Save the game here.
[136:12.48]You're probably wondering.
[136:13.30]What an idiot!
[136:14.98]Nope.
[136:15.86]Naval Yard.
[136:25.66]I'm gonna get three ore trucks, and then we'll just power it through.
[136:37.58]Okay.
[136:42.24]Gunboat.
[136:42.70]Let's get a gun.
[136:43.32]Let's get some Gunboats.
[136:44.64]No.
[136:46.00]Check what's up here.
[136:46.64]Transport.
[136:51.92]Like a spy?
[136:53.16]We're going to transport a spy over here.
[136:55.58]That's what I heard.
[136:56.64]Doc.
[136:56.94]Is he coming?
[136:58.30]Alright, get all the way over here because we have to...
[137:20.21]Shit.
[137:21.63]Alright, he's... We got that shit to deal with over there.
[137:25.65]Alright, I'm dropping the spy off.
[137:30.29]Let's go for it.
[137:33.79]I need... Where's my harvester?
[137:39.59]Just go down there for now.
[137:40.63]Okay, I'm gonna get another harvester.
[137:42.87]I'm playing the long game here.
[137:44.03]Let's see if we can get you over there safely.
[137:48.02]Without you getting attacked by the Tesla coil.
[137:56.29]Your uncle says he loves you.
[137:57.57]That's really nice.
[138:00.99]Gotta find the tech center.
[138:09.23]Four dollars currently.
[138:10.37]That's not going to help me.
[138:14.67]Nothing over there.
[138:16.17]Tesla coil.
[138:16.91]Don't have one over here?
[138:17.83]I need a... Oh!
[138:20.63]Oh!
[138:23.94]It's a submarine!
[138:27.16]Shit.
[138:28.46]How am I going to drop you off?
[138:30.24]Alright, I'm going for it.
[138:32.54]This thing's going to die, but at least I'll be able to dump him.
[138:35.20]Let him out.
[138:38.30]Okay.
[138:40.49]Holy shit, he's almost dead.
[138:42.83]Get Spy into enemy tech center.
[138:58.78]No!
[139:00.74]I didn't even see that dog!
[139:03.55]Where's the tech center?
[139:05.17]Over here.
[139:07.73]Alright.
[139:08.23]Whatever.
[139:08.61]Okay.
[139:09.57]At least I know I can do it.
[139:11.59]I'm gonna get some Gunboats and we're... What the fuck?
[139:15.65]Where's my money?
[139:17.07]Yes, sir?
[139:19.25]Awaiting orders.
[139:26.83]Alright, I got three ore trucks.
[139:28.26]Give me a silo.
[139:38.22]Okay, good.
[139:41.60]Alright.
[139:46.76]Kill it!
[139:52.09]Okay, he was an idiot.
[139:53.33]Just keep everybody over here until I get this done.
[139:55.83]Ore refinery going up right here.
[139:58.21]And then I'm gonna get another ore truck.
[139:59.59]There'll be two down here.
[140:12.16]Their base is absolutely enormous.
[140:13.96]For as big as this base is, they don't have a lot of stuff, though.
[140:25.20]Put that on hold till this is done.
[140:27.30]I'll get a free one for this anyways.
[140:34.59]After this dude dumps, we're taking him down here.
[140:39.61]To dump that.
[140:44.54]Alright, now you start grabbing it from here, and we're gonna put this right here.
[140:50.08]Go for it.
[140:50.52]Alright, I got one, two... I got a lot of stuff going on.
[140:54.74]Good.
[140:55.80]Alright.
[140:56.40]Now my... I should be being fed money.
[140:58.85]One more ore truck.
[140:59.61]Let's go fucking nuts.
[141:00.37]Why are they all coming over here?
[141:06.67]Wait, what is... Okay.
[141:13.50]Ah, I need power.
[141:18.24]I would repair this, but I don't think I really need to.
[141:23.81]Put your facecam on.
[141:25.31]I'll get that tomorrow.
[141:29.53]Uh... Excuse me?
[141:33.08]Where are you going with this?
[141:34.74]What's in there?
[141:35.28]Uh... Here comes the spaceship!
[141:41.76]Alright, it's V2 rocket!
[141:52.82]Okay.
[141:54.78]We're gonna be careful now.
[141:55.80]I need units and shit.
[141:57.47]This is... Submarine.
[141:59.31]No!
[142:01.05]Oh, fuck.
[142:01.91]Come on.
[142:02.21]I can't even do anything about this.
[142:07.13]I need...
[142:20.23]Fuck you.
[142:21.45]Not getting that shit from me.
[142:22.49]Where's my other ore truck?
[142:23.91]Alright, I need a service depot.
[142:35.15]And let's start building some tanks.
[142:36.40]Give me another spy, and let's get some tanks.
[142:44.20]Why are you going all the way across here to dump that?
[142:48.20]Look at this money rolling into.
[142:49.38]Good.
[142:49.90]Good.
[142:51.88]That means I can do this.
[142:59.84]This is the mine lair.
[143:05.28]Second war factory.
[143:06.10]I'm doing three war factories and I'm going to spam light tanks and tanks.
[143:13.91]In fact, get over here because the service depot heals tanks.
[143:19.85]Alright, how do we look?
[143:25.14]Where's my spy?
[143:26.58]I wonder if I can go this way.
[143:29.38]Right there.
[143:33.26]Medium tank.
[143:46.55]To be fair, tanks are the solution to everything in this game.
[143:49.47]That's true.
[143:50.75]Yes, that is absolutely certain.
[143:59.38]A third war factory.
[144:02.92]My money is not emptying.
[144:11.40]Although I do have to get these guys in transports, so let's hold off on that.
[144:25.23]Watch that money.
[144:26.49]Look at how fast this is going.
[144:32.07]Look at how much more, it's gonna go twice this fast when I get another one.
[144:38.77]Am I missing anything?
[144:40.66]Not quite.
[144:45.55]Alright check this out spam medium tanks And I need I'm gonna need like 10 transports
[145:12.35]This sacks so many now.
[145:13.57]I'm not even close to being done.

[150:06.93]Oh, you piece of shit.
[150:12.37]How many?
[150:14.55]How many do you have?
[150:15.44]Alright, just make like five of them.
[150:20.40]Alright, you guys keep going.
[150:21.20]Go.
[150:21.38]We're going to destroy this house of coil.
[150:24.12]You piece of shit.
[150:25.84]Alright, now then, you can't do shit now.
[150:30.87]Alright, let's get some more.
[150:33.11]Where's my spy?
[150:36.01]Fine, get in there.
[150:36.77]Get in there with, like, three tanks.
[150:38.89]Where are my guys at?
[150:41.09]Alright, here we go.
[150:44.16]You ready?
[150:44.46]Here we go.
[150:44.86]Yes, sir.
[150:47.04]Yes, sir.
[150:47.94]Yes, sir.
[151:26.65]Good.
[151:28.42]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[151:32.58]Take out the Tesla coil and... And run over the dogs while you're at it.
[151:43.48]Kill the dogs.
[151:44.90]Take out the kennel.
[151:48.28]Where's my... Where's the spy?
[151:51.82]Oh, was the spy in?
[151:53.24]Where's the spy?
[152:03.14]What?
[152:05.26]Okay.
[152:06.74]The spy was in... Wait, wait, wait.
[152:08.79]Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[152:10.41]I guess open?
[152:10.95]There's the spy.
[152:11.95]Okay, good.
[152:17.71]What's that noise?
[152:29.54]Did you hear that?
[152:36.03]Yes, sir?
[152:43.43]Yes, sir.
[152:46.24]Yes, sir.
[152:47.70]Please read this.
[152:48.38]Please re-imagine if Dermot's real name was Harold or something.
[152:50.86]Why do they need to read that?
[152:53.98]Indeed.
[152:54.34]Alright, tech center.
[152:57.08]Is this a tech center?
[152:59.80]That's a tech center, right?
[153:04.35]This is a tech center, isn't it?
[153:10.75]Get in there.
[153:15.27]Destroy all units and structures.
[153:17.26]Well, great.
[153:18.06]So, what's the point?
[153:19.08]Alright, just kill everything.
[153:33.06]Alright, I need your transports.
[153:34.54]These guys gotta go up here.
[153:37.76]Okay, um, everybody hang tight.
[153:39.56]We need transports to be filled with people.
[153:42.46]So, I got $8,000.
[153:45.80]I have made it to the max that I can.
[153:49.20]We're gonna do all medium tanks.
[153:52.48]You guys stay down there.
[154:03.49]What happened here?
[154:05.47]I need to have people stick around in these spots.
[154:14.93]Like, I need to have some tanks down here, some tanks over here, some people over here.
[154:17.55]Alright, where are my transports?
[154:21.35]I need a couple more of those.
[154:31.35]I need like three more of those.
[154:32.33]Hello?
[154:35.67]What the fuck?
[154:41.93]Give me this AA gun.
[154:47.31]Awaiting orders.
[154:52.17]How many minutes so far?
[154:54.01]I don't know.
[154:54.47]It's an RTS.
[154:55.50]The missions take a while.
[154:57.56]Why are we counting the amount of time I spend on a mission?
[155:01.68]It's like they're designed to be played over a long period of time.
[155:12.37]Yes, sir?
[155:15.99]There we go.
[155:19.69]Alright, we're good.
[155:20.61]More?
[155:42.75]Look at how many people are here, and you're just gonna let them do this?
[155:53.48]When eight-year-olds outpace you, it's an issue.
[155:55.80]Eight-year-olds don't play this game.
[155:57.78]What eight-year-old do you know that played this game?
[155:59.57]You, 20 years ago?
[156:00.51]What are you talking about?
[156:08.30]You can't even remember what you had for lunch a week or two ago.
[156:10.74]You really think you can remember, like, how fast you did Mission 7 20 years ago?
[156:23.14]Yes, sir.
[156:24.96]Yes, sir.
[156:25.88]Yes, sir.
[156:26.32]Vehicle reporting.
[156:28.70]Vehicle reporting.
[156:30.18]Fill them up.
[156:30.88]Yes, sir.
[156:33.18]Vehicle reporting.
[156:35.50]Yes, sir.
[156:40.86]It was a ham sandwich.
[156:46.02]No, it wasn't.
[156:46.62]Alright, let's get the scouts forward, and then... There's a lot of people up there.
[156:56.57]How much more space do we have?
[157:01.51]We need a few more tanks.
[157:03.97]Get them in there!
[157:08.96]More.
[157:09.32]I want 20 medium tanks.
[157:12.72]What did you eat if it wasn't a ham sandwich?
[157:15.62]It's so easy for me to tell you that I ate a ham sandwich like two years ago.
[157:20.82]What did I eat for lunch last week?
[157:22.70]I don't know.
[157:24.39]I'm not on trial here, though.
[157:25.65]You are.
[157:28.81]Tell me how fast you beat this level when you played it ten years ago.
[157:32.53]What the fuck was that?
[157:43.61]What did they just kill?
[157:44.53]What did they destroy?
[157:45.37]Oh, you motherfucker.
[157:51.94]They're just... It's alright.
[157:52.88]Where's he going?
[158:03.42]Why would you do that?
[158:04.46]That was kind of dumb.
[158:05.96]I'm just going to kill both those things.
[158:07.18]Alright, fall, fall.
[158:09.20]Almost fall.
[158:09.82]We need one more.
[158:10.42]And we're going to go for it right now.
[158:13.84]I have a ton of tanks.
[158:21.58]Scout ahead.
[158:22.18]Get up there.
[158:25.28]Here we go.
[158:32.71]By a ton, you empowered.
[158:36.23]Hold on, I'm gonna harass first.
[158:43.00]Try to get, uh, kill these, and then we're gonna go up.
[158:45.30]Because they'll just get destroyed.
[158:49.26]And please read this.
[158:51.60]Jerma, please read.
[158:52.38]Jerma, read!
[158:54.24]Here we go.
[158:57.82]Once that B-2 rocket's dead, I feel safe.
[158:59.23]Let's go!
[159:15.70]See you later.
[159:17.98]Let the games begin.
[159:21.20]Let's go!
[159:37.30]It's war.
[159:39.07]War.
[159:43.02]You can't fuck with my 20 medium tanks.
[159:47.00]You don't stand a chance.
[159:52.48]Zero.
[160:06.07]Focus the mammoth tank.
[160:09.85]I remember...
[160:11.72]playing this online and only making mammoth tanks and still losing the game.
[160:18.57]I would have like 40 or 50 mammoth tanks.
[160:24.59]Not going too far.
[160:26.59]Too far, too far.
[160:31.65]For the power.
[160:41.06]That's not surprising.
[160:42.04]Yeah, I would have like 40 mammoth tanks, and they would all slowly be going across the whole map, and I would get flanked on every side, and they wouldn't do anything.
[161:01.15]Liar, you can't remember.
[161:11.24]Here comes another mammoth tank Liar liar liar liar Liar fucking liar fucking liar right now somebody's going like this fucking liar fucking liar fucking liar fucking liar It's just like relax
[161:45.13]Yeah, this is game.
[161:55.96]Just spread them out.
[161:57.30]Are they still attacking my ship?
[162:02.32]Whatever.
[162:11.46]Alright, spread them out.
[162:12.44]You guys go down.
[162:14.10]I hope you wake up from a coma and discover your real name is Harold.
[162:27.87]Why would you want me to do that?
[162:37.54]Oh shit.
[162:40.46]What is their last-ditch effort?
[162:41.60]They sold everything.
[162:44.48]Harold, wake up.
[162:56.97]Harold, wake up.
[162:57.97]Harold!
[163:09.19]Harold, it's your mother.
[163:10.71]Harold, I love you.
[163:11.59]Wake up, please, Harold.
[163:14.16]Am I missing something?
[163:17.54]Wait, they have a bunch of submarines.
[163:21.72]Oh, that's great.
[163:26.82]That's all there is, is a fucking submarine.
[163:34.76]I gotta make Gunboats and run around in a circle like an asshole.
[163:44.85]Where's my... oh, there it is.
[163:53.25]Harold, go back to sleep.
[163:54.33]The outside world is... what?
[163:58.23]Imagine being in a coma and dreaming you're a streamer sucking at Command and Conquer.
[164:01.82]I'm about to win the mission.
[164:10.94]You guys act like my eyes are closed and I'm lying face down on the ground.
[164:17.00]What?
[164:18.16]I'm doing fine.
[164:19.34]Aren't you not doing that?
[164:24.16]Can nobody get over here and kill this?
[164:45.14]They're just stuck over here.
[164:47.40]Over there, get over there.
[164:57.71]Slowly they'll make it.
[164:58.63]Inefficient, inefficient, inefficient.
[165:03.25]You could have made V2 rockets and you would have had so much more fun.
[165:13.87]Yes, sir.
[165:15.69]Vehicle reporting.
[165:16.83]Yes, sir.
[165:17.49]Vehicle reporting.
[165:22.79]You can't make V2 rockets as the allies.
[165:24.63]Idiot!
[165:28.14]Awaiting orders.
[165:33.10]Yes, sir.
[165:37.20]Yes, sir.
[165:37.84]Yes, sir.
[165:47.45]I won.
[165:48.59]I won.
[165:58.20]48% leadership.
[165:58.70]That's better than what it was last time.
[166:00.54]80 minutes.
[166:03.90]Yeah, they're designed to take time.
[166:05.42]They're not designed to be done immediately.
[166:16.80]Imagine not being a pro at Command and Conquer.
[166:21.18]After playing one RTS in the last 15 years.
[166:24.03]How could you?
[166:50.52]The doctors are seeing your coma dreams.
[166:53.33]Wow, this guy sucks at commanding cargo.
[166:56.53]It must be because he's in a coma.
[166:57.99]It has to be.
[166:58.53]Why?
[166:59.35]There's no way he could be this terrible.
[167:01.89]Did you see what he did with his naval base?
[167:03.43]There's something with popcorn just watching the screen.
[167:07.30]Hey, get this.
[167:08.28]Hey, get this.
[167:09.58]That's hitting me kind of hard.
[167:10.78]Get this.
[167:12.40]He built a naval base and then sold it.
[167:14.46]Hey, get this.
[167:16.22]Ow.
[167:16.88]Ow.
[167:20.94]Interception of Soviet communication indicates that their Iron Curtain research was set back by espionage.
[167:27.99]Excellent work, Commander.
[167:29.05]I'm getting the same excellent work.
[167:34.23]Communique.
[167:35.65]Is that a word?
[167:36.47]Communique?
[167:38.41]Communique was traced back to secret Soviet base in Bornholm.
[167:43.75]Investigate possible connection with Iron Curtain Research, capture radar center, and destroy sub-production capability.
[167:51.21]There we go.
[167:54.79]Why is my money getting burned?
[167:56.60]Who's in here?
[167:57.28]Oh shit, it's my tank.
[168:00.62]Okay, let's go.
[168:01.28]Escort him over.
[168:18.75]This is probably a pretty good spot, not gonna lie.
[168:21.23]But I'll wait.
[168:21.73]Yeah, this is a good spot right here.
[168:24.43]Dump it.
[168:24.86]Quick.
[168:25.28]Start the production.
[168:49.32]New construction.
[168:50.20]Options.
[168:51.18]Building.
[168:52.98]Building.
[168:54.10]Building.
[168:54.60]Cancel.
[168:55.56]Building.
[168:56.00]Building.
[168:56.40]Cancel.
[168:57.56]Cancel.
[168:59.34]Yes, I modded that thing out again.
[169:04.35]I know.
[169:05.55]You're probably upset.
[169:07.55]But I did.
[169:07.75]Come on.
[169:08.03]Come on.
[169:08.53]Come on.
[169:08.83]Come on.
[169:09.13]Come on.
[169:09.41]Come on.
[169:19.14]I'm just checking to make sure there's nothing else over here.
[169:24.92]I can't wait to watch him play this for 80 minutes.
[169:26.80]I... I... Will you relax?
[170:02.68]Holy shit, he almost killed it.
[170:04.18]Kill it!
[170:04.64]Kill it before it kills my stuff!
[170:08.58]Scout.
[170:10.92]Keep the pressure up.
[170:15.73]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[170:16.63]Important.
[170:17.39]Uh, I need radar dome.
[170:19.01]No, war factory first.
[170:19.87]Just build it.
[170:23.23]Keep the pressure up.
[171:13.99]They're just feeding people up here.
[171:41.30]Alright, good.
[171:42.44]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[171:43.54]I can blow that up.
[171:44.46]Alright, you know what?
[171:45.18]Send somebody to blow that up.
[171:46.83]Blow that up.
[171:53.04]Now go, just go.
[171:54.06]Do it.
[172:40.05]That's affirmative.
[172:41.21]Vehicle.
[172:42.79]It's alright.
[172:43.73]It's alright.
[172:44.09]It's okay.
[172:44.35]It's okay.
[172:44.63]It's okay.
[172:46.88]Um, shit.
[172:47.62]What do I need?
[172:48.26]I need something.
[172:49.26]Okay, medium tank coming up.
[172:51.18]Awaiting orders.
[172:57.70]Yes, sir?
[172:59.66]Yes, sir?
[173:01.41]Squish.
[173:02.07]Just kill it.
[173:04.47]Kill it.
[173:05.73]Kill this motherfucker.
[173:08.07]Kill it!
[173:08.41]Hang back here.
[173:09.01]I got a tank.
[173:10.99]What else we got?
[173:11.95]I need money.
[173:12.49]I need ore.
[173:13.41]Ore truck.
[173:19.10]I might actually... What do you got?
[173:20.04]Is there only one tank here?
[173:22.12]No, it's not worth it.
[173:23.00]Not worth it.
[173:23.28]I'll get that radar dome.
[173:24.40]For free.
[173:30.73]Just need to buy some time here.
[173:36.86]What's better, this or Dune?
[173:39.32]I mean, this is much better.
[173:42.12]This is a far superior video game.
[173:44.76]At least I think so.
[173:47.94]Reposition the refinery.
[173:50.05]I can't.
[173:52.57]I can't.
[173:54.69]It's alright.
[173:55.41]I kept the pressure up.
[173:56.35]They can't build anybody else down here.
[173:58.87]I'm going to steal that radar dome.
[174:03.85]I'll have double the ore trucks down here, which this should last just about, give or take, about 80 minutes.
[174:12.15]Okay, we're gonna go for it.
[174:21.90]I need... Okay, let's wait for one dump.
[174:26.66]I'm gonna do a ranger car, and then a couple of infantry, and we're gonna go take this shit right now.
[174:45.28]There's the second dump.
[174:46.80]We should be able to get this.
[174:49.44]Actually, kind of glad I did that, because what are you doing here?
[174:53.28]What was that for?
[174:54.72]I think that was reinforcements.
[174:57.90]This is a risky play, but I'm going to go for it.
[175:07.55]You stay back while everyone goes forward.
[175:09.45]We're going to take out this guy right here.
[175:11.61]Kill.
[175:13.71]You stay, like, over here.
[175:22.61]Take it up.
[175:24.07]Is that what you lost?
[175:27.35]You lost somebody, but it's fine.
[175:31.33]Free radar, Dom.
[175:31.98]Let's go.
[175:32.36]Yes, sir.
[175:33.20]Yes, sir.
[175:41.86]Any more money?
[175:53.46]He's not doing this efficiently!
[175:55.60]Okay, good.
[176:06.86]Don't go that... No, no, no.
[176:07.90]That was a bad idea.
[176:09.24]That was stupid, because I don't know what's up there.
[176:12.42]Continue the base.
[176:13.81]Now.
[176:14.65]Okay, okay, okay.
[176:16.09]Orifine read.
[176:16.55]Do it again.
[176:16.97]Just keep it going.
[176:17.55]Keep moving forward and put the Orifine read right here.
[176:22.60]Let's get a couple more Rangers.
[176:25.35]Jeremy, click the link.
[176:26.25]I'm busy at the moment.
[176:27.87]I can't just alt-tab and click a link.
[176:30.67]I'm going to lose the game.
[176:37.38]Ready and waiting.
[176:41.06]Yes, sir.
[176:42.26]Yes, sir.
[176:43.42]Yes, sir.
[176:54.30]If this is like a Photoshop of me eating a hot dog, I'm gonna turn the stream off.
[177:11.52]What is this?
[177:15.50]Like 35 minutes into... Into my what?
[177:21.25]Was this from today?
[177:22.23]What are you talking about?
[177:30.42]Not that one.
[177:32.54]What do you mean, not that one?
[177:33.52]Do you know how many times people spam links in here?
[177:40.48]And I'm like, oh, I wonder what that is.
[177:41.62]And it's just like the McChicken image.
[177:43.80]This happens like once every few weeks.
[177:47.62]Explain that one.
[177:48.52]I didn't write that.
[177:49.32]Somebody's lying to you.
[177:50.64]Uh-oh.
[177:51.94]Alright, I need stuff.
[178:00.87]I need... Shit!
[178:02.15]It's getting... Okay, I need rocket soldiers.
[178:06.11]Look at how menacing that is.
[178:12.27]What's important?
[178:12.91]I need power.
[178:13.51]Destroy the subpens.

[178:57.87]Hey, what are you doing over here?
[179:01.47]Alright, now, what do I need?
[179:02.73]What do you guys think?
[179:07.35]Uh, I probably need another... I'm doing a second ore refinery.
[179:13.91]Yeah.
[179:15.27]No.
[179:16.09]Just give me another ore truck.
[179:17.39]No.
[179:18.05]Ore refinery down here.
[179:22.74]I'm gonna take a look.
[179:23.22]Just wanna make sure this is safe.
[179:24.52]It's not safe.
[179:24.88]I heard that.
[179:34.23]Just hang out over there.
[179:41.34]Are you serious?
[179:44.28]Can you not run over anybody?
[179:48.99]How is that even possible?
[180:05.08]Okay, we're good.
[180:15.41]Now, um... Let's get a light tank.
[180:23.30]In fact, put some... I gotta make some infantry there, because they're gonna keep doing that shit.
[180:26.40]I'm putting... I'm gonna put some infantry down here.
[180:33.46]They're going to keep dropping people on me.
[180:37.20]Don't go up too far.
[180:37.86]What do we have, a silo?
[180:43.46]Make a silo.
[180:51.29]Build close to the oar?
[180:53.09]I just, I got scared.
[180:55.17]I couldn't help it.
[180:58.02]Alright, you stay down here.
[180:59.00]Keep these guys next to this.
[181:01.04]You can stay here too.
[181:02.26]Let's get actually another couple riflemen because when I destroy the planes, I'm going to land here and that'd be bad.
[181:06.02]Alright, now.
[181:09.33]I'm starting to get some money.
[181:11.31]I'm going to go pillbox.
[181:12.85]Here.
[181:13.87]And turret.
[181:19.47]I feel like this is a game where you can just build 300 infantry and win.
[181:22.15]Oh, no way.
[181:22.65]They'll just get run over.
[181:26.39]They'll just get run over.
[181:31.89]Uh oh, this is where I'm gonna aggro.
[181:33.95]Fuck it, you know what, just go for it.
[181:38.89]Pull the aggro, who cares.
[181:41.79]Shit, I'm not ready for this.
[181:43.15]I'm not ready for this, I'm not ready for this, I'm not ready for this, I'm not ready for this.
[181:54.32]Oh fuck, I pulled the whole thing!
[181:55.76]I pulled the whole camp!
[181:59.22]No, no, no, no, this is bad.
[182:01.14]Oh, it's over.
[182:02.20]I think I'm dead.
[182:02.87]It's over.
[182:04.97]I'm dead.
[182:05.83]Sell everything.
[182:13.25]Back up, back up, back up.
[182:14.37]Maybe they'll leave me alone.
[182:16.37]They have so many people over here.
[182:28.86]No, no!
[182:34.46]Oh my god, they're gonna kill my construction site!
[182:42.19]Alright, uh, I still have a- I'm okay on money, but I just got so fucked, it's unbelievable.
[182:58.39]They have fucking planes and shit.
[183:06.38]Here comes the attack.
[183:07.18]I think this is the end here.
[183:08.34]I'm gonna have to redo this one.
[183:09.76]Yeah, they're advancing.
[183:14.57]Damn it!
[183:17.03]Damn it!
[183:17.43]I'm so... They have so much more stuff than... I'm just gonna board.
[183:28.14]How much money did they have like an extra 50 million dollars?
[183:45.51]Yes, sir
[183:56.68]I gotta be quicker.
[183:57.60]And I gotta get tanks.
[183:59.52]Warfactory immediately.
[184:00.67]Deploy, you dumb motherfucker.
[184:01.51]What are you doing?
[184:02.65]Just stay here.
[184:03.55]Go right here.
[184:28.21]You can't verbally abuse your units until they do what you want them to do.
[184:56.39]Back to the Soviet Union.
[184:57.53]What are you talking about?
[184:59.83]Right here.
[185:00.55]Lower.
[185:01.49]And then we're going barracks.
[185:04.06]Immediately.
[185:04.80]Quick.
[185:05.74]And then war factory.
[185:06.94]The second I'm able to.
[185:07.88]Yes, sir?
[185:18.77]Yes, sir?
[185:22.83]Yes, sir?
[185:23.39]At once.
[185:27.03]He's defecting.
[185:27.73]He's defecting.
[185:29.71]I'm not defecting.
[185:30.63]How much APM am I at?
[185:32.99]I don't have anything that's counting.
[185:43.06]Let him come to you.
[185:51.15]At once.
[185:51.99]Awaiting orders.
[186:01.49]Like, why don't I select you, and I say, go here and do this.
[186:05.71]Why don't you just stand still?
[186:14.66]Get over there.
[186:15.02]You're upsetting me.
[186:31.81]You're gonna think I'm a fucking psycho for this, but I'm doing a third ore truck.
[186:40.64]Yes, sir.
[186:54.88]Yes, sir.
[187:02.89]I hate this.
[187:08.79]I hate it because they might just attack right now.
[187:13.26]Why am I buying silos?
[187:15.10]Because this is what you do.
[187:16.56]You bought a silo here because there's too much ore gets in there.
[187:19.22]I actually don't remember what these do.
[187:20.88]I know the silo overflows when you have too much money, right?
[187:24.59]And you get like the diminishing returns or something.
[187:26.65]What do the silos do?
[187:27.71]I forget.
[187:36.08]You don't have... I know, but this is for the future.
[187:37.32]It's an investment for the future.
[187:38.85]They're useless.
[187:39.39]No, they're not.
[187:39.89]You can hold more credits.
[187:40.67]I know, right.
[187:41.09]It's an investment for the future.
[187:41.93]Alright, done.
[187:42.97]Good.
[187:43.47]Three war trucks.
[187:44.29]Now I got money rolling in.
[187:46.15]Vehicle reporting.
[187:48.11]Second war factory.
[187:52.89]Where's he going with that shit?
[187:53.69]Not affirmative.
[187:59.99]You attacked me in 15 minutes.
[188:01.69]Not fair!
[188:07.73]I'm just going to spam light tanks until I have a second war factor.
[188:18.72]Nice air force.
[188:41.34]We're good.
[188:42.28]I'm fine.
[188:43.10]I'm fine.
[188:47.62]I'm fine.
[188:49.42]The plan's gonna work.
[188:50.52]Good.
[188:51.58]Good.
[188:52.89]Good.
[189:15.78]Third?
[189:16.26]No.
[189:16.84]Okay, now radar dome.
[189:18.32]No, no, no.
[189:18.62]They have a radar dome down there.
[189:19.56]Just light tanks.
[189:21.82]I need a barracks.
[189:22.32]Mm-hmm.
[189:25.98]We're good.
[189:47.69]dump it okay now uh another light tank I think I can actually take it now just give me an engineer give me two engineers no no it's not worth it how much is a uh it's 300 bucks for that just no just one engineer take the red item
[190:12.10]What does having multiple war factories do?
[190:14.20]Having multiple of anything in the game that makes units will make it go faster.
[190:20.48]So for instance, if I have like six war factories, these will almost instantly produce.
[190:28.65]Anything that produces units will double.
[190:33.59]Here we go.
[190:43.08]One more light tank and I'm going.
[190:46.34]Engineer can stay back.
[190:47.29]Let's get this ready.
[190:48.37]Now I actually have a bunch of people.
[190:50.23]I have fighters now.
[190:53.27]I have to leave.
[190:53.99]I'm going to leave a few people behind.
[190:56.95]This should be enough to take this.
[190:58.11]Move up.
[191:13.54]Alright, got it.
[191:14.50]Without much of a problem.
[191:51.64]Give me the engineer.
[191:53.50]No air force.
[191:54.66]I'll make an air force.
[191:55.96]Just wait.
[191:56.60]Okay, more artillery.
[192:21.20]Look at my money.

[200:28.28]That's pretty much their fleet, man.
[200:29.32]It's not over yet.
[200:29.98]Everything's fine.
[200:52.47]It's gonna get really hairy here in a second, though.
[200:54.23]They have all this money everywhere.
[201:00.47]I don't know if you drive over them instantly, but when I try to do it, they go around the people that I'm trying to have them drive over.
[201:10.93]Alright.
[201:14.27]Wow, you just completely, you just fucked yourself here.

[203:42.94]I don't know why they keep just dumping people over here.
[203:45.88]What are they doing?
[203:46.53]Alright.

[208:28.41]It's, like, harder to play events against a computer than a person.
[208:31.27]Because, like, the computer does shit like this.
[208:33.21]Like, what are you doing?
[208:34.96]You're confusing me!
[208:36.08]The tactic is working!

[210:40.91]Yeah, I do.
[210:41.39]I don't know, where are they even getting the money to do all this?
[210:45.09]There ain't gonna be any more money left.
[210:51.87]Oh, there it is.
[211:00.40]It's here.
[211:06.82]Fuckers.

[225:48.78]I did it!
[225:49.46]It's over.
[225:51.67]The Tesla coil is strong.
[225:52.85]Yeah, it's like the most destructive thing in the whole game.
[226:22.85]There really are so many people.
[226:30.23]Get rid of that thing.

[226:51.03]Really?
[226:51.77]You're that desperate?

[227:49.21]Take out the suck pens.
[227:55.59]I think I just hit him.

[228:55.09]I still have my construction yard.
[229:11.34]There's no money left anyway.
[229:13.28]I think I can kill them still.
[229:21.21]The artillery has a bunch of range.
[229:22.51]They just can't go underwater or I'm softlocked.
[229:27.23]There's a little bit of money left in their base.
[229:35.44]Okay.
[229:36.82]Nobody fire yet.
[229:37.78]Seriously, nobody fire.
[229:40.10]Do not fire.
[229:42.16]I need to get all the artillery up here and fire at the exact same time and kill them on hit.
[229:47.12]Destroy subpens.
[229:47.96]You idiot, don't fire.
[229:49.10]I just told you not to fire.
[229:50.20]Don't fire.
[230:11.75]Don't fire.

[233:37.74]Oh, come on.
[233:39.68]Are you serious?
[233:43.02]I can't... No, I can't build a navy because I sold my construction yard.
[233:57.21]Yes, sir.
[233:58.13]Yes, sir.
[233:59.97]Come on.
[234:00.39]There can't be much more than that.
[234:03.05]What about off the coast over here?
[234:04.99]I'll try to go this way.
[234:08.57]Sell units and make a new yard.
[234:10.55]I can't make a new yard.
[234:12.61]No, this is over.
[234:18.58]This is over.
[234:19.96]I actually have to either restart or put a cheat code in.
[234:23.08]Yes, sir.
[234:32.02]There's like a pen down here that I can't see.
[234:33.70]How do I cheat?

[235:07.09]Does it enter?
[235:08.59]Yes, sir.
[235:12.09]It doesn't look like you won.
[235:14.27]They're saying APC is aquatic.
[235:19.29]What do you mean, APC what?
[235:31.00]What's aquatic?
[235:32.74]Yes, sir.
[235:34.26]I don't have an APC.
[235:38.22]That's not aquatic.
[235:40.98]No, this thing's not aquatic, guys.
[235:46.20]Sell and build an ore truck.
[235:48.36]I don't have anything to sell.
[235:50.04]You can't sell units.
[235:52.52]No, that's it.
[235:53.84]I lose.
[235:54.54]Good game.
[236:11.38]I can't, I don't think I can... No, I'm actually softlocked.
[236:23.53]I can't beat this.
[236:24.23]I cannot win.
[236:24.83]How far, where is this?
[236:40.91]Alright, I'm still good.
[236:44.33]Alright, go in, go in, right?
[236:46.72]Go in, just kill everything, quick.
[236:47.90]Alright.
[237:10.26]Tesla Tesla Tesla Tesla Tesla coil Yes

[237:43.09]Okay, alright.
[237:48.31]Here we go.
[237:49.63]I still have the naval yard.
[237:50.70]I'm still... Everything's good to go.
[237:52.22]We're gonna build destroyers.
[237:54.34]No.
[237:55.58]Gunboats.
[237:57.54]I like ten of them.
[237:58.44]I feel like at least five of them.
[238:03.27]Artillery.
[238:04.35]Artillery and Gunboats.
[238:16.53]I don't need that much artillery.
[238:21.19]I do need Gunboats though.
[238:24.41]We're going to do the same thing we did.
[238:25.45]We're going to go in and we're going to attack.
[238:28.77]We have to do this quickly though.
[238:32.44]Like, for instance, I remember getting angry at this part right here.
[238:35.38]I got really fucking mad at this part, because now I... Remember I said this?
[238:39.93]Oh, I just moved him and all of a sudden now I... Remember I said that?
[238:42.49]You remember that, right?
[239:02.43]Okay, here we go.
[239:02.99]Just get them in close, and they'll take care of the rest.
[239:05.85]No more gun votes after this.
[239:11.08]Just each of you pick a spot, for the love of God.
[239:14.10]And now fire.
[239:36.98]Okay, stay there.
[239:39.26]Check it.
[239:39.74]I don't have any, uh... Sell everything except the construction yard, no.
[239:49.11]No, I don't have to do that yet.
[239:50.73]I don't have to do that right now.
[239:55.26]Let me take care of this first.
[240:14.43]I'm gonna do this first.
[240:15.51]Okay, there's no more money.
[240:21.77]It might be time to do everything except construction yard.
[240:23.75]I actually agree with you now.
[240:27.06]But not yet.
[240:30.76]Save it right before that happens.
[240:39.48]Oh.
[240:40.34]My.
[240:41.18]God.
[240:43.95]Why do you have this many subs just sitting up here?

[240:54.18]Why do you have this many?
[240:59.91]Why are they over here?
[241:05.33]Why do you have this many submarines?
[241:12.10]Fuck is that?
[241:43.17]We have to go in now.
[241:50.60]We have to go in now.
[241:54.74]Build!
[241:55.08]Why isn't it building?
[241:56.98]Do I need a power plant?
[241:58.58]Okay, let's see what the fuck's going on here.
[242:00.82]I need power right now.
[242:02.17]Oh, wait.
[242:02.61]What?
[242:02.85]What?

[242:18.44]Okay.
[242:21.16]Okay.
[242:22.14]Good morning.
[242:37.60]There's still a goddamn power plant over here.
[242:43.35]Just gah!
[242:46.15]I'm not bringing the ore trucks.
[242:47.59]I'm not bringing the ore trucks.
[242:48.75]I can't.
[242:49.09]I need like one power.
[242:50.67]Keep the ore trucks because when I clear this...
[243:07.76]Kill this.
[243:10.63]Use your artillery in range.
[243:13.15]Fire!
[243:20.79]It's so, so strong.
[243:22.51]They're insane.
[243:24.97]And I made... Oh my god.
[243:27.19]I have to redo it.
[243:29.48]It's so fucking strong.
[243:31.62]Just go in.
[243:32.46]Who cares?
[243:34.44]What the fuck?
[243:36.50]Just get in there.
[243:40.20]Holy shit, man.
[243:41.62]No, I have to do it.
[243:42.60]I have to do it.
[243:43.54]Not Gunboats.
[244:16.99]What's the cheating bullshit that just happened right there?
[244:19.47]They got two buildings at the same time?
[244:21.34]You're gonna have two buildings building at the same time?
[244:24.08]How are you building these this fast?
[244:26.48]What are you talking about?
[244:29.71]That's literally cheating.
[244:50.78]Still okay.
[244:51.78]It's not over yet.
[244:54.08]It actually might be alright.
[244:57.72]I have $5,000.
[245:33.20]I'm coming.
[246:03.32]The dogs are gonna eat your tank.
[246:04.64]I gotta get rid of their defense, man.
[246:33.54]Alright, I have an idea.
[246:34.98]How much is barracks?
[246:37.10]I'm gonna steal, I'm gonna steal their water refinery.
[246:42.20]Just get rid of the Tesla coils and shit, and these things.
[247:07.36]Testicle coils are ridiculously expensive.
[247:10.32]You guys are fucking kidding me.
[247:24.45]I can't even run him over because he's stuck in the corner.
[247:30.64]Can you please just... In what world can I not kill two infantrymen?
[247:37.88]With two fucking tanks.
[247:40.34]Why do you take so long to kill them?
[247:43.22]Why?
[247:43.74]They're gonna rebuild everything.
[247:45.26]Well, I'm like pushing on my face right now.
[248:08.87]These aren't even going to do anything.
[248:10.37]What the hell are these things going to even do?
[248:13.56]I'm fucked again.
[248:17.78]No, but please build like 10 structures in less than a minute.
[248:22.76]Build an ore refinery?
[248:23.88]I can't even... I can only mine over here.
[248:32.50]You get to double build?
[248:34.14]What the fuck?
[248:40.84]Alright, I need to have... I'm so mad right now.
[248:54.33]I can't even do anything.
[249:06.60]I can't salvage this.
[249:07.36]I have to start it over again.
[249:12.92]The infinite resource computer.
[249:14.55]Oh, yeah.
[249:14.71]Okay, let's launch these guys.
[249:16.17]These are like $6,000.
[249:55.24]He's even up here.
[249:57.38]This dude has so much money.
[249:59.70]He just put like $20,000 in submarines just up here in a fucking toy closet.
[250:05.70]He's not even using them.
[250:06.67]Why is it so quiet?
[250:42.33]Do the exact same thing I did last time, just don't sell the construction site.
[250:51.23]I needed to have... I needed to have won, like, 25 minutes ago in-game.
[250:58.97]There's no more money.
[251:01.55]There's no more money, and he has more... He just has never-ending regenerating money.
[251:08.65]It's about money!
[251:10.21]Okay.
[251:17.64]I guess do the same thing I did last time.
[251:18.98]Fuck it.
[251:19.26]Who cares?
[251:19.60]I'm just not going to sell the construction yard and I'm going to keep one power plant.
[251:23.22]Let's go.
[251:24.34]Let's go.
[251:24.76]Let's go.
[251:25.23]Let's go.
[251:25.63]Leave the naval yard, one power plant, construction yard.
[251:27.81]Sell everything else and just get a bunch of artillery and go.
[251:29.97]And fucking just go.
[251:30.91]Just do it.
[251:31.49]Go.
[251:34.95]And then when they're all dead, I can start mining and then go search for their 50 submarines.
[251:43.72]Alright.
[251:44.40]Are you ready?
[251:45.16]Are we ready?
[251:46.48]Let's go.
[251:55.33]Okay.
[251:58.05]Artillery.
[252:01.42]You guys stay here.
[252:02.12]God damn it.
[252:03.14]A shitload of artillery.
[252:05.16]And then I need to see... They need to be placed over here.
[252:07.76]Okay.
[252:26.78]Just keep getting those crumbs on the ground.
[252:28.46]Yes, sir.
[252:31.12]Keep a couple guys in defense.
[252:32.64]Yes, sir.
[252:33.32]Alright.
[252:33.89]I'm going to keep these three guys here.
[252:36.15]Yeah.
[252:37.11]Okay.
[252:38.35]Where are my electricity testers?
[252:39.77]Where are the guys that are going to lick the inside of the socket to see if there's any electricity?
[253:28.93]Artillery.
[253:31.57]That's good.
[253:32.93]Now I just have to move them here.
[253:37.18]There's still a power plant that's right over here.
[253:40.78]Can I reach?
[253:41.80]Yes, I can.
[253:44.42]This begins now.
[253:48.67]It begins now.
[253:50.11]Now.
[253:50.37]Electricity tester!
[253:54.87]Please stick your tongue in the socket.
[253:57.60]Not yet.
[253:58.06]Not yet.
[253:58.36]Not yet.
[253:58.68]Not yet.
[254:16.15]Yes, sir.
[254:16.73]At once.
[254:17.43]Okay.
[254:18.05]Very important job.
[254:18.83]Go for it.
[254:20.03]Okay.
[254:23.11]Why am I not using planes?
[254:24.86]Because I can't build them.
[254:29.52]Holy shit.
[254:34.20]Look at that overkill.
[254:35.06]Look at that overkill.
[254:35.58]Did you see that fucking overkill?
[254:37.29]They don't have anything now.
[254:38.03]He just shot all the rockets.
[254:41.65]What just happened?
[254:43.59]Go.
[254:43.83]Get in.
[254:44.05]They don't have anything.
[254:44.93]They shot all the rockets already.
[255:04.92]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's right!
[255:07.02]Don't go to that far!
[255:23.41]That's unfair!
[255:50.53]Fuck outta here.
[256:13.69]Okay, it's gonna work this time.
[256:17.75]Thank, everybody thank the guy that stuck his tongue in the loop.
[256:20.59]Get up there, okay, okay.
[256:22.23]No, no, no, don't go that way, kill him.
[256:26.14]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out!
[256:51.88]Oh, I love this game.
[256:52.92]I love it.
[256:54.42]I love it.
[256:59.03]Now just have at it.
[256:59.97]Kill whatever you want.
[257:01.67]You.
[257:02.95]You too.
[257:04.21]This way.
[257:05.61]Alright, guys.
[257:07.79]It's time to steal.
[257:09.97]I'm gonna steal their refinery.
[257:40.29]Steal both their refineries.
[257:41.40]I'll have two.
[257:41.92]Why does that matter?
[257:42.50]Alright.
[257:43.56]Good game.
[257:43.82]Good game.
[257:44.82]Now, bring me an engineer.
[257:47.98]What are you firing at?
[257:50.16]Bring me an engineer.
[258:12.67]I did it.
[258:12.95]Now I'm just gonna build like 30 destroyers.
[258:18.70]Okay, I need a barracks.
[258:39.51]And then I need, wait a minute, hold on.
[258:40.89]I need to barracks and then sell.
[258:43.39]Okay, barracks.
[258:45.11]Sell my refinery.
[258:50.73]Oh, fuck.
[258:51.89]I need power.
[258:54.84]How much do I give a sell?
[258:55.56]And then engineer, steal their refinery.
[259:23.72]Ready and waiting.
[259:25.64]At once.
[259:30.64]Why did I do that?
[259:31.36]Because I'm going to steal their refinery so I can get over here.
[259:37.08]Why did I?
[259:37.50]What do you mean?
[259:38.36]Because they have to go a long way.
[259:39.80]And I don't have any money.
[259:44.94]I can take them.
[259:45.66]Okay.
[259:46.30]Just watch.
[259:46.86]You'll see.
[259:47.26]You'll get it.
[259:47.68]You'll get it.
[259:47.98]Because they're going to go and deposit this one.
[259:55.40]Don't worry, it's all part of the plan here, because now I can just build a bunch of destroyers.
[260:00.67]Let's actually get one queued up.
[260:02.27]Wait, just make sure I'm not stupid.
[260:03.79]Are you actually repairing this?
[260:10.16]Have you just been in the lobby the whole time?
[260:24.24]Stop.
[260:25.16]Stop firing!
[260:27.28]Jesus, man.
[260:33.60]Don't turn.
[260:34.18]Don't turn.
[260:34.56]Don't turn!
[260:35.02]Done.
[260:37.20]We're good.
[260:45.16]See?
[260:45.80]Then they have a much shorter trip.
[260:48.12]Destroyers.
[260:49.94]Just only destroyers.
[260:50.97]That's it.
[260:51.47]Nothing else.
[261:03.00]actually gonna go down here very well why is this guy so nutty me yes sir yes sir affirmative yeah very well yeah okay reporting yeah okay reporting acknowledged
[261:33.17]Get this up, Hen.
[261:33.57]More destroyed.
[261:34.59]How many do I need?
[261:35.23]Like, ten.
[261:56.89]They probably have like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[261:58.25]Okay, I'm gonna guess... I'm gonna guess 6.
[262:02.05]Just stuffed up here in his closet.
[262:05.48]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[262:06.58]So that means I have to go in with like 10.
[262:21.77]Yes, sir?
[262:24.53]It takes 80 minutes per level.
[262:27.80]Yeah, well, this is a hard game.
[262:31.08]It's tricky.
[262:32.42]And yeah, okay.
[262:33.60]I'll level with you here.
[262:34.82]I will be fair.
[262:37.44]I don't, RTS is not like the thing that I'm known for.
[262:41.06]I'm mostly known for beating the last boss in Sekiro on stream in under 60 tries.
[262:47.45]That's what I'm known for.
[262:48.25]This is not what I'm known for.
[262:49.65]So obviously I'm not going to be that great.
[263:07.88]There's no way I lose.
[263:08.76]I can't lose.
[263:10.68]I actually cannot lose.
[263:13.38]As long as I have... Look at how big this navy is.
[263:22.04]I'll be ready.
[263:22.58]Wait, this guy actually beat Sekiro?
[263:31.69]Yep.
[263:32.63]I really did.
[263:36.11]Alright, is there anything else I should do?
[263:44.36]How about a second naval yard to make this faster?
[263:47.62]Yeah, there's plenty of money over here.
[264:08.30]Come on, really?
[264:09.36]Is this too far away?
[264:14.78]What?
[264:17.58]What?
[264:28.60]Power.
[264:32.79]Just capture the other refinery.
[264:39.04]Why did I do that?
[264:39.98]Why did I do that?
[264:40.82]I could have put it over... You know, I'm known for... I used to do these things called TF2 live gameplay commentaries.
[264:49.34]And I used to play as certain characters, like the spy, and I would go for weapons.
[264:54.21]Yes, sir?
[265:00.09]This has to be enough.
[265:00.85]Awaiting affirmative.
[265:02.11]You know what I mean?
[265:03.07]Seriously?
[265:04.07]This is... There's so many bullets.
[265:05.80]Yes, sir?
[265:08.33]If this is not enough, then I deserve to lose.
[265:11.61]Let's go.
[265:11.97]You have the tactical advantage?
[265:16.15]Not really.
[265:20.35]He has submarines.
[265:21.07]I don't know where they are.
[265:21.77]I mean, they're here, but they could be anywhere.
[266:13.66]I know I have to destroy the substance.
[266:19.76]What do you think affirmative?
[266:53.23]Let's celebrate.
[266:53.95]Vehicle reporting.
[266:56.10]Yes, sir.
[266:56.60]Yes, sir.
[266:56.90]Yes, sir.
[266:57.18]Yes, sir.
[266:57.48]Yes, sir.
[266:57.78]Yes, sir.
[266:58.44]Yes, sir.
[267:16.40]Where are the planes coming from?
[267:20.34]Remember, ceasefire!
[267:23.23]Ceasefire!
[267:24.63]Ceasefire!
[267:25.29]Ceasefire!
[267:26.73]Ceasefire!
[267:27.35]Where are the planes coming from?
[267:43.02]Oh my god, you have so many submarines.
[267:46.74]Just get in.
[267:50.01]Where are the planes?
[267:56.13]Is there a tiny island that he put an airstrip on?
[268:11.23]Where is that?
[268:12.53]You know what?
[268:13.03]Go look over here.
[268:13.87]I need to know.
[268:19.22]There's a Tesla coil over here.
[268:23.06]This guy, these things are like $2,800.
[268:24.22]These are like $3,000.
[268:26.48]Why is it over here?
[268:34.29]Awaiting orders.
[268:37.91]Yes, sir.
[268:43.34]Okay, there is no other area on this map.
[268:49.83]Where's the other airfield?
[268:54.63]That doesn't make any sense.
[269:11.42]Got it.
[269:17.04]That's two hours.
[269:20.42]Whatever.
[269:45.17]The game just crashed.
[269:46.17]I got the actual spinning death and the window came up that said the program stopped responding, but now it came back.
[269:55.82]Thank God.
[269:56.42]I left.
[270:37.81]Incredible!
[270:39.63]We made it disappear and reappear.
[270:43.92]But with very little control.
[270:46.86]We lost some men.
[270:48.36]But do you have the control problem solved?
[270:51.16]That is the heart of the Chronosphere project.
[270:54.56]Chronosphere?
[270:55.26]Charging?
[270:56.22]This is where you come in.
[270:58.60]I wanted you to see this so you understand the importance of your next mission.
[271:07.37]The Klonosphere is being tested here at a research center outside Leich.
[271:13.73]The Soviets recently learned of its location and have begun bombing it regularly.
[271:20.01]You must protect this research site.
[271:23.46]and the scientists working inside.
[271:26.73]Get to the base immediately and fortify it.
[271:29.79]We would evacuate the base, but months of preparation would be wasted.
[271:35.69]The buildings and their contents must remain operational until the experiment is complete.
[271:41.91]Oh boy.
[271:45.00]So I have to defend against probably waves.
[271:51.69]We need to shitload the same site.
[271:53.13]We need to shitload of AA guns.
[271:56.13]We need to shitload of pillboxes and crates.
[272:04.58]I don't even have a... Alright, this is the base.
[272:09.58]What is that?
[272:10.88]This is the Chronosphere.
[272:12.29]Okay.
[272:12.73]Alright.
[272:13.01]Go, go, go, go!
[272:13.95]What am I doing?
[272:14.33]Go, go!
[272:15.05]I need to go.
[272:15.97]I need to go.
[272:16.63]Go!
[272:17.41]Go!
[272:25.64]Awaiting orders.
[272:37.28]Yeah.
[272:38.66]Where are they attacking?
[272:42.54]Yes, sir.
[272:47.77]At once.
[272:48.61]Very well.
[272:49.83]Agreed.
[272:50.37]Very well.
[273:04.61]Get down there.
[273:19.10]I could just build it over here, though.
[273:23.10]Get in.
[273:35.56]That's the definition of a bad idea.
[273:38.34]It's alright, I made it.
[273:39.84]That was just to get the escort over here.
[273:41.17]That's it.
[273:43.37]Alright, get in here.
[273:48.09]Sell the tech center if you need cash, you just need the chronosphere.
[273:52.29]Not a bad idea.
[273:52.85]Alright, let's get it.
[273:54.53]Right, it is good.
[274:02.09]Alright, let's do it.
[274:04.75]What do we got over here?
[274:06.91]I have lots of money.
[274:07.99]Tons of money.
[274:08.53]Shoot it!
[274:09.11]Oh, I need the power!
[274:11.62]Power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power, power.
[274:27.12]Alright, anybody else?
[274:27.86]I could maybe take this over?
[274:32.52]Oh, don't you dare.
[274:34.82]Fuck.
[274:36.44]Okay, I need to... I just... Wrong power plant!
[274:40.12]I picked the wrong one!
[274:40.90]AA gun.
[274:46.26]He's gonna do this in more than 40 minutes.
[274:51.85]Don't worry.
[274:53.23]There's plenty of time.
[275:00.81]Good.
[275:01.03]Alright, everything's online.
[275:03.42]I'm gonna fortify the fuck out of this place.
[275:05.54]Alright, now I just need to survive for 40 minutes!
[275:21.53]Oh, God!
[275:21.77]I need...
[275:32.22]Kill this.
[275:32.76]Dude, you got mammoth tanks and shit up here already?
[275:40.61]Huh?
[275:40.97]You've already got mammoth tanks?
[275:44.05]Oh fuck.
[275:45.29]Oh fuck.
[275:49.93]Oh fuck.
[275:50.93]What are you guys just standing around for?
[276:08.69]Alright.

[280:39.75]Hurry up!
[280:43.39]Get the fuck outta here.
[280:55.42]I might just sell the tech center.
[280:56.76]That was actually pretty good advice.
[280:58.16]Sell tech center if you need, uh, stuff.
[281:00.24]Um, okay.
[281:06.61]Here comes another bunch of people.
[281:19.45]It's all that orange building in the middle.
[281:21.15]What orange building?
[281:26.32]I can't.
[281:27.94]That's not mine.
[281:30.34]You mean the Chronosphere?
[281:31.78]Almost.
[281:32.88]Close.
[281:33.28]I need the money.
[281:59.48]They're in the tech center.
[282:00.48]They're in the tech center.
[282:01.22]They're in the tech center.
[282:01.90]Somebody told me to sell the tech center, and they were so convincing.
[282:04.61]Because they didn't need the tech center.
[282:09.13]Somebody said, if you run out of money, sell the tech center.
[282:11.89]And I go to sell the Chronosphere.
[282:15.33]And I even said it twice back to myself over the last 15 minutes.
[282:23.94]And I have to start over from the very beginning.
[282:28.95]Alright, let me do this differently.
[282:30.15]I'm just gonna go in.
[282:38.36]Fuck it.
[282:38.66]I'm just gonna go through.
[282:45.44]I'm fucking sad right now.
[283:02.61]Oh, my body hurts.
[283:03.67]My whole body hurts.

[294:36.17]They're useless.
[294:37.09]Okay, okay.

[294:43.57]Yes, sir.
[295:01.75]I need some tanks.
[295:03.15]In fact, I'm doing two war factories.
[295:04.82]Everybody relax.
[295:12.88]That means go.
[295:16.83]When I click, that means you go.
[295:18.75]Don't stand there.
[295:19.37]Cell tech center.
[295:32.03]Don't let him just stay there.
[295:33.01]Kill it.
[295:34.09]That means attack it.
[295:39.20]Is there a reason why we won't shoot this?
[295:41.06]Don't let that thing take off.
[295:42.88]Okay, good.
[295:43.40]Second war factory.
[295:44.80]Now we start going tank city.
[295:47.54]Let's go.
[296:05.40]I actually can't believe I have to do this for 30 minutes.
[296:07.17]Fuck.
[296:07.35]They just keep going in different directions.
[296:13.63]Okay, we're fine.
[296:14.35]Yes.
[296:14.49]Yes.
[296:31.73]I'm doing four tanks and some people up at the front door.
[296:36.08]Some people over here, and then a few tanks over here.
[296:38.76]You stay this way.
[296:40.54]Good.
[296:40.98]This is intense.
[296:42.30]I have no money either.
[296:46.62]Alright, second ore truck.
[296:48.58]Okay.
[297:05.89]Sell the walls so the trucks can get in.
[297:10.95]I hope you're right.
[297:21.65]No, that's a good idea.
[297:24.07]That's not a bad idea.
[297:25.13]That's fine.
[297:25.57]How are we doing?
[297:27.17]We got some V2 rockets coming down this way.
[297:32.36]Alright, fuck.
[297:33.16]It's alright.
[297:34.24]We need to be over there, too.
[297:37.03]Seriously, you need to be over here.
[297:42.43]I gotta cut them off.
[297:43.17]Okay, they got harassed.
[297:48.33]Good.
[297:49.37]Get up right in their face.
[297:50.22]Good.
[297:50.36]Oh, fuck.
[298:01.33]Okay.
[298:01.61]Nice.
[298:06.77]I think this is time to save the game now.
[298:13.87]He's so stressed.
[298:14.73]Yeah, it's a very stressful game.
[298:17.37]It's super stressful.
[298:23.60]Sounds good.
[298:25.08]Zelda's spinning.
[298:26.14]I don't know what those are.
[298:27.32]I'm not going to touch those.
[298:34.75]Fucker.
[298:39.83]Sell them.
[298:40.25]I'm not gonna sell them.
[298:45.03]Managed tank.
[298:45.93]Good.
[298:47.23]Actually, those were actually very good.
[298:51.11]25 more minutes and we're done.
[298:56.93]Let's get another medium tank.
[299:05.27]I would build more turrets, but I guess maybe I'll put another one over here.
[299:13.70]Sell your construction yard?
[299:15.02]Why would I do that?
[299:17.24]That sounds like a bad idea.
[299:18.26]I'll do one more up here, in this spot.
[299:39.18]Alright, here it comes, here it comes.
[299:40.38]Block him off, block him off.
[299:41.52]They're going to come.
[299:42.53]Don't even let them get to shore.
[299:44.11]Don't let them get to shore.
[299:46.57]Where are they?
[299:49.55]Where are they?
[300:12.59]How have they got all the way around?
[300:14.09]Is it even possible to get over there?
[300:15.53]You guys are so useless.
[300:20.96]I'm gonna take the long way.
[300:31.16]Every time.
[300:41.04]I just want to run around in a giant circle.
[300:45.02]Just get up there and fight.
[301:06.57]So I'm gonna start doing light tanks.
[301:08.95]No, only medium tanks.
[301:12.77]Let's get some more infantry as well.
[301:15.57]Oh, I don't need money.
[301:16.25]I need more money than this.
[301:36.29]Where's he going?
[301:40.51]Alright, that's fine.
[301:42.13]Don't let him stand there.
[302:10.64]Two mammoth takes.
[302:12.52]Two mammoth takes.
[302:13.84]Two mammoth takes.
[302:17.56]Focus.
[302:18.06]Focus one at a time.
[302:20.81]Oh shit, I can't build any.
[302:31.40]Fall back.
[302:32.30]Fall back to the tech center.
[302:43.09]What was that?
[302:48.43]I've still got plenty of money.
[302:49.45]Fifteen minutes.
[302:51.05]How am I doing?
[302:51.83]I've got power still.
[302:53.63]You can come back.
[302:54.39]To the front.
[303:10.29]He's going to be playing this the whole stream.
[303:13.11]I mean, I've been playing for five hours already.
[303:14.60]This is what we're doing.
[303:15.54]Alright, I knew I should have waited here.
[303:19.84]Yeah, idiot.
[303:20.50]Get out of here.
[303:21.12]Don't let him get away with that.
[303:22.78]He's going to go all the way around.
[303:39.40]Be ready.
[303:39.76]Oh god!
[303:40.11]The V2 rockets are over here!
[303:45.25]13 minutes!
[303:45.53]I need to stop making stuff!
[304:23.55]Vehicle reporting.
[304:25.98]Rocket soldiers.
[304:31.12]Build turrets?
[304:33.42]Yeah.
[304:34.24]I mean... Yes, sir.
[304:35.22]But they'll get in.
[304:37.24]I only got ten minutes.
[304:37.88]I'm good.
[304:52.05]Good.
[304:53.03]Probably gonna get really hairy here in a second.
[304:56.61]I'm just gonna block the port.
[305:02.93]Where you going?
[305:05.23]Okay.
[305:08.99]Get outta here with this shit.
[305:10.75]Here they come.
[305:11.47]Alright, get ready.
[305:12.07]Oh, you're going for my shit, huh?
[305:21.69]That ain't gonna happen.
[305:25.21]Alright, now I'm gonna do only turrets.
[305:35.85]I'm gonna pull everybody back.
[305:41.29]I want at least three turrets on each side.
[305:42.97]I heard something.
[305:49.50]Don't let him destroy that I need that Nine minutes remain I
[306:16.10]Yeah, he ain't going in this way.
[306:18.72]That's fine.
[306:19.34]Coming this way.
[306:20.28]One mammoth tank.
[306:20.92]LOL.
[306:22.02]So much to pay attention to.
[306:51.26]Who's left?
[306:51.78]What else?
[306:52.06]What else?
[306:52.28]What else?
[306:52.52]What else?
[306:52.78]What else?
[306:53.06]What else?
[306:53.38]We good?
[306:53.70]Don't let them in the base.
[307:08.95]They're going for the V2 rockets.
[307:13.99]Um, um, I don't know.
[307:14.99]Over here?
[307:15.29]I don't know if this is doing sound.
[307:35.89]Five minutes.
[307:36.81]That's it.
[307:37.39]Get over there.
[307:39.06]Okay, another turret.
[307:40.98]Don't go too far out here.
[307:57.83]What needs help, this side does.
[308:00.41]Uh-oh, we're on the northern front.
[308:27.72]Money!
[308:32.00]Alright, don't bring every single person.
[308:42.71]Pull it back.
[308:45.41]That hurt.
[308:47.01]Pull it back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[308:48.32]I need some right side support.
[308:57.23]Alright.
[308:58.15]Three minutes.
[309:00.09]I haven't saved it in a long time.
[309:11.84]This should be in the bag.
[309:12.74]Alright.
[309:13.42]This was wild.
[309:13.96]40 minute defense now.
[309:29.10]Two minutes remain.
[309:47.92]I think it's going to take too long for them to get over here.
[309:53.52]This should be done.
[309:55.00]I really just hope I don't have to kill them at the end.
[309:56.80]Because that would suck.
[310:08.34]Kill his ore truck?
[310:10.46]I have to assume that ore is meaningless, because they just, it's like waves, so I don't think, I don't think he even has to actually spend money.
[310:21.17]Plus, we got 30 seconds still.
[310:29.60]This is counting down very fast.
[310:33.94]Is it counting down that fast?
[310:37.20]So that wasn't 40 minutes then.
[310:38.66]That was like 10 minutes.
[310:43.40]46 minutes.
[310:47.28]No, I guess it was 46 minutes.
[311:06.70]Incredible.
[311:12.79]Alright.
[311:16.97]I feel like I've gone bottom most of the time.
[311:20.25]Let's go up.
[311:30.07]Commander.
[311:30.67]Is he controlling that?
[311:31.73]I believe he may well be at the turning point of this war.
[311:36.91]with Stalin's Iron Curtain offline, and the success of the Chronosphere, victory is finally within our grasp.
[311:45.75]However, there is still much to be done.
[311:51.50]One of our spies has confirmed our worst fears.
[311:55.04]The Russians have developed a weapon greater than anything previously known, an atomic bomb.
[312:02.43]Stalin plans to unleash these bombs on several European cities.
[312:07.44]If he succeeds, all they have worked for as a race, as allies, will be for naught.
[312:14.46]This is Major Vladimir Kosygin, one of Stalin's key atomic strategists.
[312:21.49]Intelligence indicates that he has vital information on Stalin's plans for this new weapon.
[312:27.95]Kosygin is appalled by Stalin's methods and is ready to defect.
[312:33.32]Apparently, Stalin plans to use his own troops as sacrificial lambs to draw our forces into a trap.
[312:42.40]Once V takes a bait, he drops a bomb.
[312:47.74]You will find Kosygin here, in the Reha compound.
[312:51.85]Direct the spy past that compound's defenses to the command center.
[312:57.97]Once you reach Kosygin, get your APCs in and Kosygin out.
[313:14.87]Build your base, get a spy into the command center.
[313:21.47]Let's do it.
[313:22.25]Let's see if we can get this one clean and quick.
[313:57.02]Yes, sir.
[313:57.38]At once.
[314:00.46]Awaiting orders.
[314:01.00]Dude, is there any ore on this whole island?
[314:10.41]At once.
[314:11.89]At once.
[314:12.31]Well, why am I building a refinery then?
[314:16.01]Very well.
[314:18.27]Agreed.
[314:18.85]Yes, sir.
[314:24.50]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[314:26.16]I should have built it right over here, though.
[314:28.42]Alright, I'm restarting.
[314:31.98]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[314:33.28]This is going to be clean and quick.
[314:34.26]This is not clean and quick.
[314:35.20]You have the game speed turned up?
[314:39.20]This is the default, though, I think, isn't it?
[314:53.14]I don't think I changed anything.
[314:59.90]There we go.
[315:02.54]Turn it up more.
[315:03.78]No, you can't play this game at, like, x10 speed.
[315:05.88]It's ridiculous.
[315:09.96]Yeah, there's plenty of food over here.
[315:14.52]Plenty of food.
[315:16.66]I think the default's actually even faster.
[315:20.59]I think it actually is.
[315:22.12]But it becomes unmanageable when you go so high.
[315:25.08]For instance, just look.
[315:29.32]1, 2.
[315:29.58]Like, just watch this.
[315:30.30]My brain can't handle this.
[315:32.52]Turn it down, turn it down.
[315:33.60]It's actually hurting me.
[315:50.02]Okay, good.
[315:50.94]Uh, now we're gonna do barracks.
[315:54.44]Let's get a spy.
[316:02.55]Spy is... we need a... radar dome.
[316:08.97]Not advanced power first.
[316:15.96]You gonna do Red Alert 2 some other day?
[316:18.72]Maybe?
[316:19.08]I mean, I love these games.
[316:22.29]I didn't play that much Red Alert 2, but I do remember it was fun.
[316:29.49]You can deploy your troops in Red Alert 2, right?
[316:36.28]You can bunker them down in that big mechanic of the game.
[316:40.34]Actually, it's pretty huge.
[316:46.78]Get a spy into the command center.
[316:49.88]I'm going to try.
[316:50.64]Need a naval yard.
[316:56.23]Go ahead and build it.
[317:04.85]They promote.
[317:05.41]That's right.
[317:05.93]They do promote.
[317:06.63]That's so fun.
[317:07.33]Yeah, I'll play that.
[317:12.36]I'm thinking down here, so the transports aren't any danger.
[317:19.40]Let's get him in one, see what we can do.
[317:20.66]War Factory.
[317:21.44]Generals is the best one.
[317:23.28]They're all good.
[317:23.80]Indeed.
[317:41.36]There's not very many Command and Conquerors that aren't fun.
[317:45.36]Tiberian Sun is fun.
[317:47.48]Alright, I'm just gonna go on a little espionage mission here.
[318:00.53]Just keep going up.
[318:01.97]Doesn't seem like I'm in very much danger, but I'm gonna tech for a little bit to make sure I don't get killed.
[318:07.01]Have an assault team going with the spy?
[318:12.49]The reason why I don't want to do that is because they might just all instantly die.
[318:15.75]I am going to do three ore trucks together at the same time.
[318:26.72]Let's do a... Get a surface depot, too.
[318:31.77]I want a tech, tech, tech, tech, tech, tech, tech.
[318:34.07]Alright, let's dump them.
[318:43.06]I'm gonna get eaten by a dog instantly.
[318:44.58]There's a huge map, too.
[318:48.02]Alright, let's do... another War Factory.
[319:09.67]Dog, dog, dog, because there's a dog, dog, dog right next to me.
[319:13.21]Fuck, okay, how am I going to wrap around?
[319:24.98]What's their route?
[319:26.62]I might have to do some killing here.
[319:28.04]I might actually have to bring an assault team up.
[319:29.66]Because I'm not sure this wraps around.
[319:38.27]For king and country.
[319:42.55]Alright, we have to, yeah, we gotta get an assault team up here.
[319:46.71]Because we gotta go right at the front door.
[319:48.13]And they ain't gonna move.
[319:49.95]Alright, let's get some, uh, you know, come pick these guys up.
[319:52.27]Why not?
[319:52.57]I got them right here.
[319:57.63]You know what?
[319:58.03]I'm doing fourth or truck.
[319:59.12]You can't stop me.
[320:04.84]Tech, tech, tech, tech.
[320:10.81]Let's kill this dog.
[320:12.09]What the fuck is that?
[320:12.77]What is that doing?
[320:15.29]Why did you not shoot the dog?
[320:17.57]Get away!
[320:17.97]Why did you not shoot the dog?
[320:39.73]Click attack dog and it is walking over like shoot it Now I'm fucking mad we're just going we're just going in with hardcore I'm just going in with a shitload of artillery.

[321:11.00]That shit's gonna be coming over here.
[321:17.89]I'll do two.
[321:19.07]And then another power plant after this.
[321:33.09]Anyone remember the Roblox version?
[321:36.91]What are you talking about?
[321:39.47]No.
[321:43.49]Alright, give me some transports.
[321:44.45]Should I do another naval yard?
[321:52.71]Probably.
[321:56.25]I just want to start... I want to... I want to start just hammering them.
[322:04.41]From far away.
[322:05.25]So I'm going to bring... All of you get in here.
[322:09.55]How many can fit in here?
[322:15.66]And let's get some rangers.
[322:16.64]Let's get some jeeps.
[322:22.36]Am I having fun?
[322:23.12]Yeah, I love this game.
[322:26.76]We're doing artillery and jeeps.
[322:36.98]And then, yeah, we'll do one more with... I need... Yeah.

[323:04.42]Yes, sir.
[323:05.08]Yes, sir.
[323:05.40]That's not full.
[323:05.72]What are you talking about?
[323:10.20]Vehicle reporting.
[323:10.84]Yes, sir.
[323:15.00]Where are all the fart and poop jokes?
[323:17.00]I don't know.
[323:18.00]Tomorrow.
[323:19.75]I don't know.
[323:21.25]I'm playing Man of Conqueror.
[323:22.91]Don't stop such a thing.
[323:27.87]No, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[323:30.26]I'm trying to move you.
[323:36.71]Awaiting orders.
[323:38.31]Yes, sir.
[323:39.07]Awaiting orders.
[323:40.41]Okay.
[323:40.77]This is artillery.
[323:41.77]This is jeeps.
[323:43.25]I want a couple more.
[323:43.99]I want a couple more jeeps.
[323:53.01]Yes, sir.
[323:59.24]Yes, sir.
[324:01.18]Get in.
[324:03.10]Awaiting orders.

[324:06.65]Vehicle reporting.
[324:07.87]Yes, sir.
[324:09.49]Yes, sir.
[324:10.29]What the fuck?
[324:11.46]Yes, sir.
[324:11.92]That's so stupid.
[324:13.34]Silo!
[324:21.24]Yes, sir.
[324:22.02]Yes, sir.
[324:22.54]No, no more rangers.
[324:24.46]Now I need artillery.
[324:30.80]Low power.
[324:31.36]My ass is low power.
[324:40.94]And we'll do rocket soldiers.
[324:44.12]Hold on.
[324:44.48]I can do transports, right?
[324:45.44]APC is a transport vehicle.
[324:49.44]We're going to do 50 people in these.
[324:52.56]I don't know.
[324:52.96]We'll find out.
[324:53.50]Give me a second, Barracks.
[324:56.82]I got plenty of money.
[325:11.92]What's in here?
[325:15.80]Alright, so this is artillery, jeeps, artillery, units.
[325:24.39]Just make a shitload of people.
[325:29.41]You're downloading this right now?
[325:31.06]I mean, I wouldn't blame you.
[325:31.92]It's an awesome game.
[325:45.71]Faster.
[325:55.34]More.
[325:59.88]Another APC.
[326:06.48]Four more.
[326:10.40]Load them all up.
[326:17.42]Get in the boat.
[326:20.16]I still need some artillery.
[326:24.76]These guys are all gonna just fucking die, aren't they?
[326:28.23]They're all just going to die immediately.
[326:32.89]No, not if I do this right.
[326:35.81]As long as I don't go over there yet.
[326:37.15]And then I gotta get back, but the spy has to be filled up too.
[326:40.57]This is full.
[326:41.23]Get in the boat.
[326:49.92]The rocket soldiers are for the helicopters.
[327:01.40]How many more?
[327:03.04]We need two more.
[327:04.46]One more.
[327:04.72]No, not a gunboat.
[327:05.66]Why is the stream silent?
[327:19.98]It's not.
[327:21.26]I think you need to check your ears, I think.
[327:23.90]Why is this guy a silent screamer?
[327:25.58]Alright, I hope this is worth it, because this is literally all the money I have.
[327:52.50]1930's Silent Stream.
[327:55.32]Alright.
[327:58.70]We gotta go in a safe spot.
[328:02.89]This is it.
[328:04.79]This is it.
[328:07.43]Okay.
[328:08.03]I don't even have any defense.
[328:11.79]I'm gonna keep a couple of just little light tanks behind.
[328:14.58]Alright.
[328:16.48]It's time.
[328:18.14]Do not destroy their tech center, right?
[328:23.15]Wait!
[328:23.33]I need, oh no, I need, I need, oh no!
[328:28.70]Don't do it, no, get away from me.
[328:32.90]No!
[328:33.10]I need my rocket soldiers.
[328:34.62]No, okay, open.
[328:36.40]I need at least a few dumped out, good.
[328:56.52]Stop going that far.
[328:58.16]Alright, now you're fucked.
[328:59.91]Isn't that many people firing at you at the same time?
[329:07.69]There's so much shit here.
[329:27.81]Alright, bring the APCs back.
[329:34.09]Yes, sir.
[329:36.49]Yes, sir.
[329:37.87]Vehicle reporting.
[329:40.29]In case I need to do this again.
[329:44.44]Awaiting orders.
[329:46.12]Vehicle reporting.
[329:47.06]Alright.
[329:49.00]Here we go.
[329:50.06]Get them out of here.
[329:52.88]Yes, sir.
[329:53.70]Vehicle reporting.
[329:54.38]Yes, sir.
[329:54.88]Awaiting orders.
[329:58.49]Okay, this is going to be really, really terrible, I think.
[330:04.61]Jeep's up front.
[330:05.27]Stop.
[330:05.51]Don't go that far.
[330:08.37]Don't go that far.
[330:09.27]Jeep's up front.
[330:10.09]Jeep's are going to be won.
[330:11.59]So...
[330:29.49]Alright.
[330:30.09]Alright, Larry, it works.
[330:31.17]Okay, you guys all are going to be over here.
[330:37.03]You guys will be three.
[330:38.75]And the infantry is going to be two.
[330:58.89]One, two, three.
[330:59.33]Here we go.
[330:59.89]Let's give it, let's give it a shot.
[331:01.55]Where are the dogs?
[331:02.57]Oh, oh fuck.
[331:02.85]Oh fuck.
[331:03.13]Oh fuck.
[331:03.45]That's a lot.
[331:03.85]Just kill it!
[331:36.39]That's a lot of people Ready
[332:07.28]Yes, sir.
[332:09.78]Vehicle reporting.
[332:11.74]Yes, sir.
[332:15.58]Yes, sir.
[332:16.16]King and country.
[332:16.94]Commander.
[332:19.55]Commander.
[332:20.83]Yes, sir.
[332:21.43]On my way.
[332:22.05]OK.
[332:24.23]Commander.
[332:27.99]Vehicle reporting.
[332:30.13]Oh, no.
[332:30.79]Yes, sir.
[332:32.05]Commander.
[332:33.69]Yes, sir.
[332:35.51]There's people in there.
[332:38.60]There's people in here.
[332:39.58]Get out!
[332:44.08]Open, open, open, open, open.
[332:48.84]Out, out, out, out, out.
[332:51.51]Wait, those things attack.
[332:52.39]I didn't realize.
[333:14.06]no dogs just gotta get to the tech center on my way for king and country for king and country on my way indeed for king and country alright this tech center right here for king and country yes for king and country yes sir indeed indeed commander king and country but that's not that's the command center
[333:41.57]Bring him back to them.
[333:44.25]Oh shit.
[333:44.99]Wait, is he just gonna walk out?
[333:48.07]He's just gonna walk out?
[333:49.39]Oh, there's dogs now.
[333:51.55]Uh-oh.
[333:53.75]We need to make a distraction.
[334:32.19]Yes, of course.
[334:35.19]Commander.
[334:35.45]Or king and country.
[334:37.74]You brought him over here!
[334:40.40]I... God damn it.
[334:41.60]I can't... What the fuck?
[334:45.84]I don't even know where... Where did I save the fucking... I don't even know where I saved the game.
[334:50.93]Wait, did I even save it?
[334:51.89]I don't even know.
[334:54.57]What's it called?
[334:55.05]I don't even know.
[334:59.72]There's like 60 dogs in this base.
[335:07.13]Yes, sir.
[335:08.09]Oh, my fucking God.
[335:15.15]They even have them up in the corner, stored.
[335:20.88]Fuck.
[335:22.00]What a pain in the ass.
[335:25.32]A waiting order.
[335:27.80]Yes, sir.
[335:29.08]Alright, well, now that I know that the entire base is dogs.
[335:32.33]Now I know.
[335:46.21]How are you supposed to sneak a spy in there?
[335:48.99]That doesn't work.
[335:51.17]The whole base is dogs.
[335:52.31]How do you get in there?
[335:54.48]Do I have to just go kill everything and then sneak a spy in?
[336:00.56]The term sneak doesn't make any sense at that point.
[336:05.57]Just run in and just cause a massacre and then sneak in a spy when there's three buildings left.
[336:17.44]Just zerg the dogs.
[336:20.20]Send a hundred spies.
[336:21.90]I might even just fucking do that.
[336:28.50]No, they can't even attack.
[336:43.80]I can't believe I didn't even save it either.
[336:45.20]Ugh, that's so annoying.
[336:54.23]You can't win against Soviet might.
[336:55.73]No, you can't win against stealth missions.
[337:06.80]He's fully malded.
[337:07.94]Well, not yet.
[337:13.23]Who's my favorite classical composer?
[337:14.67]Uh, I don't even know... I don't know any classical composers.
[337:18.61]Besides, like, Beethoven.
[337:19.73]I guess Beethoven's pretty cool.
[337:28.85]I mean, Beethoven?
[337:31.41]Mozart?
[337:31.87]I mean, yeah.
[337:32.83]I don't... I'm not... I don't have Beethoven CDs in my car.
[337:42.15]Alright, we're going tanks, and we're just going, we're just, we're going hard.
[337:47.25]Shitload of tanks, shitload of light tanks.
[337:50.38]Just run them over.
[337:51.70]Kim says that he's still on the same level.
[337:53.64]Yes, sir.
[337:56.32]I am not on the same level.
[337:58.36]No, I'm not.
[337:59.62]When Kim was watching, like, an hour ago, I was on the previous mission.
[338:03.70]This is a different mission.
[338:11.89]By the way, just in case anyone's curious, I'm doing six ore trucks.
[338:17.22]And then I'm gonna save the damn game.
[338:36.18]Because nobody's attacking.
[338:37.70]Nobody attacks.
[338:39.52]So I may as well just spam ore trucks and just have 20 million bajillion dollars.
[338:44.27]That's it.
[339:00.43]Last one.
[339:00.79]They're going to start running into each other.
[339:13.92]Okay.
[339:15.06]Get the radar dome.
[339:16.70]I want to build another construction site.
[339:22.76]I wish I built another one.
[339:23.78]That would have been really stupid.
[339:29.47]And guess what?
[339:29.93]I'm doing a third war factory, and then I'm going to send 50 tanks up here.
[339:35.57]Because I'm going to be a psycho about this.
[339:50.10]Dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump.
[340:02.59]You wouldn't do 50 war trucks, would you?
[340:05.45]I probably would.
[340:06.77]But I'd like to beat this level.
[340:10.89]I'd like to complete this.
[340:11.73]It'd be good.
[340:17.05]Remember, this level's unbeatable without the fursuit.
[340:20.13]Ah, shit.
[340:20.61]Where do I get that?
[340:21.25]Alright, that's enough.
[340:31.60]Look at these medium tanks.
[340:32.80]They're just so... They're just so spammable.
[340:37.49]One more silo.
[340:50.05]Alright.
[340:50.81]I don't want to just only... I gotta do this again, too.
[340:56.66]I gotta build a nail yard.
[340:58.18]Oh, that sucks.
[341:02.08]You promised to eat a ghost pepper.
[341:03.33]What happened?
[341:03.73]I already did it.
[341:04.13]I ate it.
[341:05.29]It was gross.
[341:07.35]It was gross.
[341:17.37]No one's coming over here.
[341:19.85]Transports.
[341:20.51]Let's get a barracks up here.
[341:29.38]I'm almost ready.
[341:37.38]Just chewing through money.
[341:43.21]Start stacking them.
[341:50.11]Stack him up!
[341:53.91]I can't really spend the money I have here.
[342:02.84]If I get attacked, and they kill, uh, ten medium tanks, I'm gonna be very, very upset.
[342:10.58]Is this full?
[342:13.06]It's still space.
[342:18.95]Cry, cry, cry, cry, cry.
[342:24.16]Yes, sir.
[342:25.36]Yes, sir.
[342:25.76]Why are you guys so vicious?
[342:28.18]Yes, sir.
[342:28.66]Awaiting order.
[342:30.18]Yes, sir.
[342:32.02]Vehicle reporting.
[342:37.35]Alright, move.
[342:38.27]Yes, sir.
[342:40.79]Somebody go dump.
[342:42.35]Yes, sir.
[342:43.47]Yes, sir.
[342:44.81]Yes, sir.
[342:49.67]Full.
[342:50.09]Full.
[342:50.61]Full.
[342:51.01]This one's not full.
[342:53.47]Alright, that's 15 medium tanks.
[343:00.60]We're going 20.
[343:03.04]And I'm just going to get them over there.
[343:05.04]With... Just some... I don't know.
[343:12.96]Am I doing a 24 hour stream?
[343:14.66]No, I'll probably finish up soon here.
[343:17.07]And then we're streaming the game rewards tomorrow.
[343:29.47]I need... I need APCs.
[343:34.54]Just a couple, because I'm doing 10.
[343:36.24]And these things fire.
[343:37.02]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[343:49.12]1... 2... 3...
[343:59.61]Four.
[344:01.71]Five.
[344:02.29]Okay.
[344:06.55]Start filling them up.
[344:07.61]Oh, my fingers.
[344:11.63]Alright, I need a couple more tanks.
[344:14.00]I'm going to mix it up a little bit, though.
[344:16.38]Let's do...
[344:27.42]Hmm.
[344:28.48]Let's do some light, some rangers.
[344:34.97]Stop counting up.
[344:36.39]Stop counting.
[344:36.83]You're in trouble.
[344:44.49]Yes, sir.
[344:45.37]Yes, sir.
[344:45.93]At once.
[344:47.28]Yes, sir.
[344:50.32]I'm saving it here.
[344:50.94]I don't even know what this one's called.
[344:56.55]This game is so much fun, though.
[344:57.83]It really is.
[344:59.97]So we got two Cs.
[345:03.09]We'll go like that.
[345:05.17]And then a couple of light tanks.
[345:06.83]Sounds good to me.
[345:07.53]Who cares?
[345:07.85]We're just going into fucking... We're trying to slaughter.
[345:09.57]My hands hurt.
[345:24.08]There's a lot of clicking involved.
[345:26.16]I'm getting, like, my fingers hurt.
[345:29.64]That's enough.
[345:31.50]Save the game, and let's move out.
[345:41.85]Alright.
[345:47.27]I'm gonna move them away.
[345:53.59]I'm not going right in the front door.
[345:55.91]I want to see if I can wrap around.
[345:57.32]If I can, then I can.
[345:58.40]If I can't, then I can't.
[345:59.98]Right?
[346:00.34]But at least I'm trying.
[346:01.58]Because if I can come down, I would just launch an artillery into, like, the dog pen.
[346:08.74]Oh, this is... bad.
[346:10.54]Can I get through?
[346:11.00]Can I get through?
[346:12.16]Can I get through?
[346:12.62]Can I get through?
[346:25.41]Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.
[346:27.91]Okay, I have to go the other way.
[346:31.51]Yeah, you gotta go the other way.

[346:50.01]Yes, sir.
[346:53.61]Vehicle reporting.

[348:10.75]And then remove guy.
[348:11.57]Alright.
[348:11.99]But I'm gonna pull everybody.
[348:12.77]How the fuck am I supposed to get by this?
[348:25.92]If I'm supposed to sneak by, there's no... They'll see you.

[351:54.56]What in the ever-living fuck are you doing?
[352:02.79]How many times do I have to click on that before you attack?
[352:05.95]What are you doing?
[352:06.79]What the fuck are you standing there for?
[352:14.00]I just, whatever.
[352:15.46]I don't know what you want me to do.
[352:17.58]Shoot him?
[352:18.60]I don't know what that is.
[352:22.20]Vehicle reporting orders.
[352:24.68]Commander.
[352:25.46]Commander.
[352:28.18]Commander.
[352:29.06]Indeed.
[352:29.86]Let's go.
[352:31.36]On my way.
[352:32.00]For king and country.
[352:39.96]Indeed.
[352:40.38]What is going on here?
[352:44.26]Fuckin' God.
[352:47.80]What a pain in the ass you are.
[352:52.60]What was the goal here?
[352:54.75]To just be annoying.
[352:55.69]That's all it was.
[352:57.73]Okay.
[352:57.99]So...
[353:13.25]I just have to get in there.
[353:15.53]And then just wait to... There's a plan here.
[353:17.59]Plan is... Spread them out.
[353:19.73]So... Here we go.
[353:43.45]for king and country.
[354:17.92]Get out!
[354:19.98]Just go!
[354:49.03]Get him up!
[354:51.01]Okay, we did it.
[354:52.01]Okay.
[354:54.37]Get in.
[354:55.67]Okay, get the fuck out of here.
[354:57.41]Where's the helicopter?
[354:58.31]Where's the helicopter?
[355:01.49]Where's the helicopter?
[355:02.61]Where's the... How do I get him out of here?
[355:06.19]How do I get him out of here?
[355:09.13]How do I leave?
[355:12.91]Wait, it's north?
[355:14.55]No, it's not.
[355:16.91]What is that?
[355:25.01]Oh, I did it.
[355:40.32]40 minutes, not 80.
[355:40.92]I did have to restart though.
[355:52.65]That's so funny, that's so funny.
[355:58.46]Alright, how we doing?
[356:01.22]Let's see, what's the next mission look like?
[356:02.96]See if we're gonna do it.
[356:05.38]How many atomic bombs does Stalin possess?
[356:13.77]At least four two kiloton warheads are in production.
[356:18.84]There is much even I do not know.
[356:21.48]Much we are not told.
[356:22.96]Stalin's speech is coming on.
[356:32.07]Shh, here comes the speech.
[356:34.37]Who's that woman?
[356:36.55]Stalin's... Turn it off, I can't hear it.
[356:39.13]Correct?
[356:41.01]I can think of a better word to describe her.
[356:47.92]Yet.
[356:52.62]He is mad.
[356:54.12]How can he do this?
[356:55.74]Explain, Kosygin.
[356:56.54]What are you talking about?
[356:57.38]Stalin.
[356:58.22]He announced he is telling everyone he's threatening to destroy the world.
[357:02.20]His missiles are ready.
[357:02.96]He's preparing to launch.
[357:03.98]Is this possible?
[357:04.84]A week ago, no.
[357:06.00]But now, who knows?
[357:07.86]This does not sound like a bluff.
[357:13.23]Even now, a great purge tears through the Kremlin.
[357:16.85]Your allied force becomes too powerful.
[357:19.27]In his fury, Stalin kills his own people.
[357:23.19]More death, more dishonor.
[357:26.53]So Russians are manufacturing missiles at this site?
[357:31.32]This factory's main site.
[357:32.64]Stalin.
[357:33.90]We call it Chomnyi Vasodniki.
[357:36.98]The Dark Horseman.
[357:40.23]You thought this was an ad for the tank game?
[357:41.95]You must destroy it.
[357:43.72]Oh, the iOS game?
[357:44.76]Everything scorched Earth.
[357:48.64]Establish a base first, then move in on the command center.
[357:53.02]Get a spy inside.
[357:54.24]No, I don't want spies.
[357:55.06]And neutralize launch capabilities.
[357:56.80]I don't want to get spies in the base anymore.
[357:58.42]Once the missiles are neutralized, destroy the facility.
[358:02.94]Everything scorched Earth.
[358:07.77]You can't say sneak a guy in and then spoilster.
[358:18.81]Destroy all Soviet units and structures.
[358:21.16]I'm going to give this one attempt.
[358:24.44]One attempt and then I'm going to call it a night.
[358:26.06]And then we're going to get the Game Awards stream ready tomorrow.
[358:29.06]And the explain how the Fuck the King stream is going to work.
[358:33.40]Let's set up shop right here.
[358:37.97]Is he addicted?
[358:38.58]Yes.
[358:39.32]But that's besides the point.
[358:40.34]Let's get some infantry.
[358:51.10]If you don't know what I'm talking about, tune in tomorrow.
[358:59.45]I will go over a full explanation of how the game is going to work.
[359:09.86]Let's just kind of take a look while we build this up.
[359:11.98]Where's the, uh... Hold on.
[359:13.88]A couple of you go this way.
[359:16.10]Where's the ore refinery capabilities, the golden ground?
[359:19.94]You know what I'm saying?
[359:22.66]Any more ore?
[359:24.66]Is there ore over here?
[359:27.02]Diamonds are over here.
[359:27.73]Or whatever the hell these are.
[359:29.13]These are worth more money.
[359:30.81]Don't go too crazy here.
[359:32.49]I need this money to make sure I'm not going into danger.
[359:40.25]There's a lot up here.
[359:43.95]Alright.
[359:45.75]Found something.
[359:49.15]Kill that dog.
[359:50.44]Kill that dog.
[359:51.94]Take a look.
[360:10.01]Oh shit, you're already down here.
[360:12.37]Okay, hold on.
[360:13.02]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[360:14.22]Go back down.
[360:36.13]Gems, how much... Gems are worth a shitload, huh?
[360:39.25]Okay, destroy all server units and structures.
[360:44.88]You got it.
[360:45.82]One attempt here and that's it.
[360:46.94]He dipped it.
[360:49.20]Planets by what?
[360:50.70]Yes, sir.
[360:55.77]Check the right.
[360:56.35]Yeah, what the hell are you guys talking about?
[361:11.24]I just want to get my idea of this room.
[361:12.99]Got a little convoy.
[361:14.37]Kill it.
[361:18.13]Kill that, whatever it is.
[361:24.24]Pick it up!
[361:24.66]Somebody get it!
[361:27.10]That was worth it.
[361:27.76]That was a bunch of money.
[361:42.20]No, ore.
[361:42.70]I want an ore truck.
[361:48.07]I'm going a little too far here.
[361:52.77]This ain't smart.
[361:57.87]I'll take some of these idiots to do a retaliation when it's over.
[362:01.51]Okay, now pull back.
[362:03.32]Pull it back.
[362:03.76]Pull it back.
[362:04.24]Pull it back.
[362:04.98]Don't go too far in, dude.
[362:16.07]Stay right here.
[362:17.09]There's plenty of ore.
[362:17.97]I'm gonna go ore up there.
[362:21.63]This actually, I don't like, uh, this is dangerous to me, but whatever.
[362:25.58]Third one.
[362:27.40]One more.
[362:31.48]Feels good, man.
[362:32.30]Scouting.
[362:32.72]That's right.
[362:33.38]That's how we do it.
[362:34.96]That's how we do it.
[362:41.20]Send a spy up there.
[362:42.74]I've killed a lot of dogs.
[362:46.20]Attack center.
[362:49.99]Helipad.
[362:50.51]Now I can make some actual shit.
[362:52.21]Now, easy on the... Easy, easy, easy, easy.
[362:54.27]What's up there?
[362:55.89]Take a look.
[363:14.33]Another tank.
[363:14.85]I need a service depot.
[363:15.71]I don't see any dogs.
[363:22.02]Although, I do need some of you guys for the flying helicopters that are gonna do that exact damn thing.
[363:29.58]Let's get like five.
[363:31.88]Nevermind.
[363:37.08]There's a dog there.
[363:50.89]He's hunting dogs on purpose.
[363:57.10]I'm going tech center.
[364:01.30]Fuck, I'm addicted to the game.
[364:02.72]I knew this was gonna happen.
[364:05.58]It's getting late, too.
[364:06.34]Because I had to start late because of the Minecraft server thing.
[364:09.88]Alright, this is the last mission and then I'm going back.
[364:13.09]And then we're done.
[364:21.92]Spend that money.
[364:24.20]Tech center.
[364:24.88]And I'm gonna do my own shit.
[364:26.18]I'm gonna do... You know what?
[364:28.48]I think I'm gonna do... I'm gonna get planes and shit.
[364:36.99]GPS satellite?
[364:37.93]What does that do?
[364:40.55]What does a GPS satellite do?
[364:42.51]I don't know.
[364:46.65]I forget.
[364:46.99]It's a full map reveal.
[364:58.02]Should I get it?
[364:59.68]How do I get it?
[365:01.96]Alright, I'm going... I'm gonna do... No, no, no.
[365:07.94]Yeah.
[365:08.28]Okay, I'm gonna do helicopters.
[365:10.04]We're gonna do, like, a bunch of helipads up here.
[365:14.40]Yes, sir.
[365:20.19]That's the cooldown.
[365:20.87]Right, right, right.
[365:21.31]I see what you mean.
[365:26.83]Nothing too funky right now.
[365:35.16]I'm gonna go up.
[365:41.62]My helipads are gonna be this way.
[365:45.10]Longbow.
[365:46.38]Service center.
[365:46.94]You get one for free!
[365:51.51]Oh, that's sick.
[365:57.68]Alright, I need more... You're gonna start into an encroach.
[366:00.78]We're getting into money territory here.
[366:04.30]Another ore truck.
[366:05.75]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[366:06.65]Slow down.
[366:10.97]I gotta start... I gotta heal some of these... Don't fucking even think about it.
[366:17.27]Get up!
[366:22.65]What the hell are you doing here?
[366:25.67]Can they not get us through this?
[366:28.89]Why does it take you so long to move?
[366:37.11]Oh my fucking god.
[366:39.79]Why is it right when I put this shit down?
[366:42.51]Oh, now we're going to attack you from the top.
[366:43.87]You just put an important structure down.
[366:45.43]Now we're here.
[366:45.83]At the top.
[366:46.55]Where do you put that down?
[366:47.25]Right where you put it.
[366:50.04]We haven't attacked in eight minutes, by the way.
[366:54.55]Hi!
[366:56.49]Fuck off with this.
[366:59.29]Oh, here!
[367:04.41]We're just here, where you aren't.
[367:05.67]These things are so expensive!
[367:16.05]And now I have an extra one.
[367:17.07]Just go fly wherever.
[367:19.26]Just scout for me.
[367:25.04]Can I do it in the service center?
[367:25.98]Oh, let me put this down.
[367:33.73]You put down an important structure and sent three people!
[367:40.15]Motherfuckers.
[367:41.71]Just go in there.
[367:42.39]Just land in front of them.
[367:45.25]I have SAM sites.
[367:46.13]This actually is a pretty bad idea.
[367:50.89]Is there a gun?
[367:51.61]No, I'm dead if I do that.
[368:13.43]Yes, sir.
[368:13.93]Agreed.
[368:17.33]Why are you all so stupid?
[368:21.03]It's so... If you're here and I click here, why don't you just go this way?
[368:25.41]You're making me angry.
[368:26.57]Awaiting order.
[368:30.17]Why would you go all the way around here to go from here to here?
[368:34.21]Yes, sir.
[368:34.83]Guys.
[368:35.67]Yes, sir.
[368:36.50]Why are you doing that?
[368:44.92]What was that?
[368:47.10]Oh, that's my satellite.
[368:47.98]I thought it was a nuke.
[368:54.08]Oh, well, you guys are fucking kidding me here.
[369:10.52]Okay.
[369:10.82]They got all that shit for free, by the way.
[369:30.28]I'll do one more.
[369:31.64]Let's see if this is going to play out.
[369:35.48]Sam site over there.
[369:37.62]Sam site over there.
[369:40.23]Damn, I don't... Over this way?
[369:42.01]There's no Sam site this way.
[369:43.01]I can take out some of this shit over here.
[369:47.89]I'm just doing helicopter run.
[369:57.76]Alright, let's go for it.
[370:10.37]I'm gonna say, where's the SAM site?
[370:12.27]SAM site is up there.
[370:15.99]So we're gonna go wrap around this way.
[370:19.75]We're gonna go this way.
[370:20.61]Fly over here.
[370:29.73]And then we're gonna fucking bomb right here.
[370:33.93]No SAM sites this way.
[370:36.87]See you later, motherfucker.
[370:42.81]Strategic bombing.
[370:47.88]Don't go that way.
[370:49.04]Fly down here.
[371:04.60]Take out the bridge.
[371:08.60]Alright, back.
[371:39.74]coming over five people why didn't I have anybody over here old woman
[372:01.10]It would have been so good.
[372:03.14]It would have been so good.
[372:04.46]I sent five regular guys over here.
[372:09.58]Oh, I'm so fucking mad.
[372:11.75]I'm so mad right now.
[372:14.15]I'm actually not happy.
[372:16.89]Like, this sucks.
[372:18.35]They're just over here shooting.
[372:20.87]That was like $15,000 worth of shit.
[372:34.27]No, nobody else do anything.
[372:36.05]Yes, sir.
[372:42.49]We're going to have to refill one at a time.
[372:45.47]Just put it right in the middle of the goddamn base, please.
[372:47.69]Yes, sir.
[372:48.66]Alright, get off.
[372:49.28]Yes, sir.
[372:49.44]Affirm and acknowledged.
[372:51.18]It's somebody else's turn.
[372:59.44]Awaiting orders.
[373:06.19]My brother used to do this one, like that, and I just copied him from 15, 20 years ago.
[373:13.96]Yes, sir?
[373:15.54]Now I'm angry.
[373:17.52]Now you fucked it up, because now I'm going up here again.
[373:22.10]What happened?
[373:26.11]Yes, sir?
[373:27.27]Yes, sir?
[373:30.41]Someone shoot this guy.
[373:36.41]Why?
[373:38.59]Yes, sir.
[373:43.01]Yes, sir.
[373:51.65]Yes, sir.
[373:54.05]Awaiting orders.
[373:58.90]Yes, sir.
[374:00.74]Yes, sir.
[374:06.58]Why won't they just... Where are they going?
[374:10.08]Don't fucking dare.
[374:15.09]Sloppy ass piece of shit.
[374:37.66]What?
[374:39.08]Am I going crazy or are they just not firing?
[374:43.24]Shoot him!
[374:44.62]Yes, sir.
[374:45.06]Agreed.
[374:45.76]Very well.
[374:46.52]Have I lost my fucking mind?
[374:48.02]Yes, sir.
[374:49.56]Yes, sir.
[374:50.05]What are you doing down here?
[374:52.73]Yes, sir.
[375:07.00]Fuck your base.
[375:12.17]I'm taking the whole damn thing out.
[375:16.11]Yeah, good luck.
[375:30.91]Don't fly out of this damn site!
[375:33.13]Come back, come back, come back.
[375:38.59]Oh, my chest.
[375:39.29]Did I lose anybody?
[375:40.35]I was like in one of these helicopters.
[376:01.60]Alright, I think I'm done.
[376:08.36]I think I'm done.
[376:09.40]I've had enough.
[376:10.44]I've had enough.
[376:14.36]This game is really fun, it's just stressful.
[376:17.47]Alright, it's somebody else's turn.
[376:20.01]Refill.
[376:36.32]Alright, what else is important?
[376:38.14]I think I could take out a SAM site.
[376:40.34]As long as I kill a SAM site and just start going for power.
[376:44.62]Wait, where's the tech center?
[376:46.54]Okay, is there a dog up here?
[376:48.83]Uh, no dog.
[376:54.97]See if I can end this.
[376:56.33]Dog right here.
[376:57.03]Kill dog with helicopters.
[377:02.51]Yes, sir.
[377:03.75]Yes, sir.
[377:04.49]Take out their ore trucks.
[377:18.06]See you later.
[377:30.30]Alright.
[377:33.28]Come on, bugs.
[377:33.90]Go back.
[377:42.43]Took every shot.
[377:43.49]And now here they come.
[377:44.51]This is where it ends.
[377:47.71]This is the end here.
[377:51.43]Fuck.
[377:52.80]I'm gonna exit the game, just because I know what's gonna happen.
[378:27.83]I burned all my money on helicopters.
[378:31.33]I did the wrong strategy.
[378:33.41]I got too... I got over... I got over mad tapped.
[378:43.98]I just have to go kill something.
[378:46.34]Alright.
[378:46.90]I'm gonna go for... See, I'm sorry.
[378:50.56]Everybody go.
[378:54.67]Even if it kills one of them, just take it out so I can keep going in here.
[378:57.53]Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
[379:00.94]Alright, start taking out power plants.
[379:05.70]Stay on site, get together!
[379:19.39]Kill the dogs!
[379:23.57]You instantly put him on the same side as me, motherfucker.
[379:25.85]We're good.
[379:36.23]Okay.
[379:37.29]Now, I just need to get him in there somehow.
[379:39.85]How do I... I gotta break into this door.
[379:41.91]Alright, shoot.
[379:44.43]Why do I hear tank shots?
[379:51.68]It's musical chairs, so you've got to find a way on.
[379:57.66]It's over.
[379:58.26]I know the game's already over.
[380:00.12]Spy gun run over.
[380:10.17]Whatever.
[380:24.58]Never give up.
[380:25.52]Alright, it's not completely over yet.
[380:33.53]It will be really soon.
[380:35.49]I need to kill...
[380:38.53]This dog over here.
[380:39.31]There's one dog somewhere over here.
[380:40.65]No, there's not.
[380:41.83]So just straight up.
[380:42.92]Kill this dog.
[380:44.64]Get into the base.
[380:46.06]There's no other dogs.
[380:48.06]Go right into the command center and the tech center.
[380:50.12]Two spies.
[380:51.26]There are no dogs.
[380:51.84]There's a dog right there.
[380:52.54]Who cares?
[380:53.12]Kill it.
[380:54.42]Check this out.
[380:57.55]Don't go that way.
[381:00.83]There's SAM sites.
[381:05.92]Kill.
[381:06.92]Where's this dog over here?
[381:07.94]There's a dog over here somewhere.
[381:09.82]Where's the dog?
[381:12.14]No, there isn't a dog.
[381:14.12]Just take out the base thing here.
[381:18.13]Just take it out and get the spy in.
[381:42.24]Good.
[381:43.06]This should be it.
[381:44.29]If this isn't it, then I quit.
[381:52.35]I have as many power plants as I have an entire base.
[381:58.73]Save the game?
[381:59.23]No, this is a shit show.
[382:00.29]I made like 12 helicopters.
[382:02.89]This is not a real game.
[382:04.45]There's a dog right there.
[382:06.65]I can take that dog.
[382:07.31]There's a dog right there too.
[382:08.03]Alright, take the dogs out.
[382:11.58]Kill that dog.
[382:11.94]And then kill that dog.
[382:13.92]Target.
[382:14.14]Anymore.
[382:14.38]I don't see anymore.
[382:15.88]Up here.
[382:41.39]Oh no, he's going for our dogs.
[382:49.67]Commander.
[382:51.11]On my way.
[382:52.48]Good to go.
[382:54.94]Why would you land over here?
[383:02.76]Yes, sir.
[383:04.24]On my way.
[383:05.02]On my way.
[383:05.87]I love this game.
[383:07.23]It's super hard and super into it.
[383:09.49]On my way.
[383:12.86]So I have to get a dog in the... Was it the tech center or the command center?
[383:17.82]It's in here, isn't it?
[383:20.04]Is it the command center or the tech center?
[383:26.76]I don't remember.
[383:47.10]Oh, for the love of God.
[383:49.54]On my way.
[383:50.50]On my way.
[383:53.00]I just thought, what was that?
[383:57.63]Commander, as you are well aware, Stalin has launched four atomic missiles.
[384:03.09]The only way to stop them now is to get into the command center.
[384:07.31]Each missile is controlled by a launch terminal.
[384:10.44]Deactivate all the launch terminals and stop those missiles.
[384:31.40]I'm sad.
[384:32.64]It's a sad day today.
[384:35.12]Oh, that sucks.
[384:36.48]That sucks.
[384:42.30]Okay.
[384:43.94]Fire at the ground over here because there's obviously mines.
[384:48.12]Activate the mines!
[384:51.06]Get in there.
[385:09.21]Indeed.
[385:12.11]For king and country.
[385:23.54]For king and country.
[385:34.79]On my way.
[385:43.55]What happened?
[386:09.58]Capture, not spy.
[386:11.82]You need to capture that with an engineer.
[386:18.20]Dude, if you go... Wait a minute.
[386:27.04]If you go just up this way... Can I cross this?
[386:35.85]Because you could just take this out.
[386:43.67]Can I... I'm testing to see.
[386:45.41]I don't think I can cross that.
[386:47.93]I don't even have any units anyways.
[386:53.27]What, through the trees?
[386:56.89]Can you, like, burn the trees down or something?
[387:03.14]No, this was a shithead run anyways.
[387:06.44]Can I cross?
[387:08.20]I don't think... No, you can't.
[387:09.24]Can you from here, maybe?
[387:10.74]It's just a little moat.
[387:13.68]Maybe I can cross it.
[387:17.93]Can you?
[387:18.61]No.
[387:30.04]Damn.
[387:34.70]Well, that was fun.
[387:37.22]That was a fun game.
[387:40.77]Red alert.
[387:43.18]It is as fun as I remember.
[387:46.16]Last time I played it, I was probably 16.
[387:47.96]It's very, very good.
[387:59.41]Last year?
[388:00.03]What?
[388:04.07]So am I going to beat it tomorrow?
[388:07.03]Uh, I don't know.
[388:07.77]I don't know about that.
[388:11.05]There's too much to do tomorrow, I think.
[388:21.29]Play Red Alert 2 before the Game Awards?
[388:23.53]I cannot do that.
[388:28.27]Before the Game Awards, I'm going to be in the Minecraft server.
[388:31.90]So... Because that is really going hard.
[388:37.70]And we need to get it set up for the weekend.
[388:39.70]Alright, that's it.
[388:44.94]I'll see you guys tomorrow for the Game Awards.
[388:47.05]You can beat this.
[388:48.79]We'll see how much time is left.
[388:49.73]How long are the Game Awards?
[388:53.13]What are they?
[388:53.45]A few hours?
[388:54.23]Two, three, four hours?
[388:54.95]Something like that?
[389:03.32]Probably a couple hours.
[389:05.14]Two, three hours.
[389:07.12]Well, it's probably going to take... It'll take probably at least 30 to 40 minutes to really slowly go over everything that's going to happen with the Minecraft server.
[389:15.59]So, after that, maybe I'll just, you know, try to beat it?
[389:19.03]I don't know.
[389:19.43]I can't make any guarantees that I'm going to play it again today, tomorrow.
[389:24.30]This mission has a special failure cutscene.
[389:27.94]Does it?
[389:35.67]Commander.
[389:37.09]Yes, sir.
[389:37.77]OK.
[390:00.26]The guys on red are like, what the hell is going on?
[390:05.96]Yes, sir.

[391:26.37]Alright, just start going.
[391:27.48]Start killing.

[391:34.44]Who cares?

[392:49.55]This is a mess.

[393:02.18]Wait, what?
[393:03.78]What?
[393:27.10]Why were they teaming up on me?
[393:37.76]What?
[393:41.08]No bases.
[393:43.60]50 units each.
[393:46.00]Eight players.
[393:50.36]Good luck.
[393:52.64]Yes, sir.

[394:28.51]Don't go up there.
[394:29.89]Don't go up there.
[394:32.67]Let them kill each other.
[394:39.50]Let them kill each other.
[394:43.36]Not you.
[394:56.17]Is there a reason why they're not fighting each other?
[394:57.51]Why is he... They know you're human.
[395:05.17]Well, this is unfair.
[395:39.95]Oh, there's Orange!
[395:42.13]Hey!
[395:44.61]It's a war, Germany.
[395:46.15]There is no fair.
[395:48.75]Well, I refuse to participate.
[396:00.08]Alright.
[396:02.16]Your APM is too low.
[396:04.38]It doesn't matter.
[396:05.36]As long as you have fun, it doesn't matter.
[396:07.64]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow for the Game Awards, and then we'll talk about Minecraft.

[396:21.11]I may or may not play this tomorrow after we go over Minecraft.
[396:25.18]I don't know.
[396:25.52]It depends on what's going on.
[396:26.66]I might have to leave and get some stuff situated with the server.
[396:30.16]It's going to be the next few days.
[396:31.04]It's going to be a little messy, so we'll see.

[397:53.72]It's not.
[397:56.20]If you're in your early 20s, you got plenty of time.

[398:03.19]26. 26.
[398:07.06]And even then, I still didn't know what the hell I was doing.
[398:11.06]And even now, I'm still a kid now.
[398:13.15]I'm not even grown up yet.
[398:19.23]And also, I got news for everybody.
[398:20.49]Nobody knows what the fuck they're doing.
[398:23.93]It's just a series of people just kind of doing the best they can.
[398:32.42]Even when you get to an age, you're like, alright, I think I figured it out.

[398:45.62]Thanks for the $2.50.
[398:48.31]AtmaStarfish, thanks for the five community subs.
[398:52.13]I was very, very focused today because this was just I play the game stream.
[398:57.36]And I was remembering and I was being very nostalgic.
[398:59.92]And I was getting... I was being very nostalgic at how angry I would get when I was 15.
[399:05.05]And I would just make the same unit and send them all to death.
[399:07.15]And then I would smash my keyboard.
[399:10.33]Went through a lot of keyboards when I was like 14.
[399:13.31]I think they were just Amazon Basics $12 keyboards.
[399:19.14]That's not canon.
[399:19.92]I know.
[399:20.30]That actually isn't canon.
[399:22.94]Now, today was canon.
[399:24.26]No, just because last week was non-canon, that doesn't bleed into the... And plus, I retroactively made two streams from last week canon.
[399:34.09]Just wait.
[399:34.41]We're gonna play Nancy Drew again next week anyways.
[399:38.73]I'm gonna do Nancy Drew, like, once a week for the next, like, year.
[399:45.60]Until people are so sick of it.
[399:49.94]No, I'm kidding.
[399:50.52]I'm not gonna do that.
[399:52.92]But thank you for the five subs, AtmaStarfish.
[399:56.12]And Atma gives 500 bits here.
[399:57.84]Right after that, they said, do you ever play Red Alert 2?
[400:00.58]Yep.
[400:01.14]That's also a fantastic game.
[400:05.16]Slight frustrations aside with Red Alert, it's still, that holds up pretty well.
[400:13.20]That still holds up 20 fucking years later.
[400:20.58]I can't imagine how Red Alert 2 holds up.
[400:25.11]But yes, I did play... Most of the time I played was Red Alert 1.
[400:29.74]Red Alert 2, I was kind of... I didn't get... Look, I didn't get it.
[400:35.96]I never got it.
[400:38.16]Especially when I was younger, I didn't get it.
[400:39.76]You know when you play Dark Souls for the first time?
[400:42.62]Ever?
[400:43.82]When Dark Souls first came out, or Demon's Souls first came out, and nobody understood what the fuck was going on?
[400:48.20]You just don't get it?
[400:50.14]Go watch my first Dark Souls video.
[400:51.72]That's a person that just doesn't understand what the game even is supposed to be.
[400:59.61]That's kind of how I was with RTSs.
[401:01.31]I just didn't make units and fight.
[401:03.57]There's no strategy, and I still don't even know what I'm doing.
[401:07.91]Point is it's a never-ending process trying to figure out, you know, what to do.
[401:17.08]But yeah, I do love the old RTS games.
[401:19.69]Warcraft 3 is another one that I was really into.
[401:21.57]Most of the custom games, though.
[401:23.75]I loved the tower defense games.
[401:25.55]People would be really angry.
[401:26.69]People would talk shit to me all the time, though, because I was so stupid and so bad.
[401:29.17]Remember the tower defense games?
[401:31.56]Custom games where you had to work together and build towers together and make the big tubes together so the monsters will actually have a trail to go on?
[401:41.12]I would just do wrong stuff.
[401:42.84]People would be like, what are you doing?
[401:44.78]You're an idiot.
[401:45.64]Why are you building that there?
[401:47.19]Stop doing that.
[401:47.91]You fucked up the whole line.
[401:49.05]And I'd be like, I don't know.
[401:51.11]I just wanted to shoot a guy.
[401:52.63]I love tower defense.
[402:01.08]There's one game mode in particular in Warcraft 3 that I was obsessed with.
[402:06.04]It was Hero Line War.
[402:08.90]And I am shocked.
[402:10.90]that people have put so much time and energy and effort into the defense of the ancient stuff and not the hero line war stuff.
[402:21.81]Because you made money and then had to send units to the other team's line.
[402:29.14]And you made money by killing other heroes that came over to fight you, or by killing monsters, and you could keep... You could send crazy, crazy expensive monsters if you wanted to, and they had to deal with them.
[402:40.20]It was two teams.
[402:42.62]Hero Line War was seriously the best custom game mode, and... Nobody gave a shit.
[402:53.40]I went back in Warcraft 3, and even Starcraft...
[402:56.72]Dota All-Stars, Dota All-Stars, Dota All-Stars.
[402:58.80]I would refresh the custom game list over and over again because I just didn't want to play Dota.
[403:03.52]And you would get that one custom game lobby that was open that wasn't Dota All-Stars.
[403:09.57]And you're like, holy shit.
[403:10.95]Thank God somebody's playing something else.
[403:20.30]It was so much fun.
[403:23.87]They wear a ton of custom games as well.
[403:25.77]I hope they bring that shit back.
[403:27.79]It was an awesome thing to do.
[403:30.65]But, I could go off for a million years here.
[403:34.16]Trident Jacks, thanks for the 500 bits.
[403:35.92]I've been really sick these past few days.
[403:37.86]Watching your videos has helped me through some of the rougher nights.
[403:40.88]Much love and appreciation.
[403:43.48]Thank you, Trident.
[403:44.60]Sorry to hear you're not feeling well.
[403:47.04]Get well soon.
[403:47.60]Hopefully you get better soon.
[403:52.61]Stream reforged.
[403:54.23]That's a plan.
[403:58.70]I'm sure it'll be really, really active, so I'll definitely do it.
[404:04.30]Juno upset.
[404:04.90]Oh, thanks to the five community subs.
[404:06.22]I think I missed it.
[404:07.26]Thank you.
[404:10.38]Five gifted subs.
[404:13.02]Should you go back to the fridge to get one more pickle?
[404:15.09]That depends.
[404:15.45]How many pickles have you already had?
[404:19.73]I'd like to know.
[404:20.65]Tell me.
[404:22.19]Bob, how many pickles?
[404:24.13]One?
[404:24.43]Oh, perhaps go get two.
[404:26.43]Yeah, that's fine.
[404:29.79]But thank you Juno Upset over the five community subs.
[404:31.69]Thank you Goop Snatch for the... That's not even the right amount of... I didn't mean to say that.
[404:37.46]I finally watched Aladdin, though.
[404:39.00]It was good.
[404:42.08]Yeah, it is.
[404:42.72]It's a really good movie.
[404:45.62]Aladdin's awesome.
[404:50.11]The original Latin.
[404:52.57]I'm glad you got to watch it.
[404:55.82]Marvash Magali, thanks for the $2.50.
[404:57.26]I love seeing you play these Boomer games.
[404:59.16]I mean, old gems.
[405:01.12]Any plan to play some old MAME games?
[405:05.59]What is MAME?
[405:06.77]Meme?
[405:09.03]What is that?
[405:13.39]And they say, is it against TOS?
[405:19.46]Uh... Arcade games?
[405:23.27]Oh.
[405:24.91]There are actually a lot that would be fun to play.
[405:27.01]I mean, it's just that most of the ones that you can't even play anymore would be fine.
[405:37.01]But... Yeah, I've thought about arcade cabinet type games before.
[405:40.56]The issue is a lot of the arcade cabinets that I would want to play came out on another console, like Dreamcast or something.
[405:51.17]But the ones that didn't, it would be fun.
[405:54.23]Just would have to set it up correctly.
[405:57.73]C4G, thanks for the 250.
[405:59.43]Germany used to never do war crimes.
[406:01.55]Pepe hands.
[406:05.21]What are you talking about?
[406:08.16]Demona Cucumber, thanks for the 250.
[406:09.50]Imagine saying, let's rock.
[406:13.54]LUL, this meme was made by I'm There Gang.
[406:22.61]Thank you for the 250.
[406:25.80]Thank you, Shalashashka, for the 250 bits.
[406:31.10]Thanks for making me feel better.
[406:32.10]You're a beautiful man with an even better heart.
[406:34.22]Drew him a heart.
[406:36.42]And then a tal groovy, a tal rad.
[406:41.23]Thank you.
[406:42.93]Glad you're feeling better.
[406:45.49]Thanks for the 250, Shalashka.
[406:49.35]Thank you so much.
[406:52.30]Well, I said it twice.
[406:53.10]The second time, it was $10.
[406:54.60]Thank you for the thousand bits.
[406:55.60]Appreciate it.
[407:12.66]I hope so There's gonna be some very strict rules on the server
[407:35.21]That have to be in place.
[407:36.53]There's a ton of stuff back end that is being done.
[407:40.11]To make this go as smoothly as possible.
[407:42.19]Although this whole thing is a beta anyways.
[407:44.37]It's just an experiment.
[407:46.27]Tease us about it.
[407:49.51]Just wait until tomorrow.
[407:50.43]I'm going to go over the whole thing tomorrow.
[407:53.64]How many people at once?
[407:55.02]It is a... I think it's a 500 plus server.
[407:59.20]So I'm not sure the exact number.
[408:01.28]But it's at least 500 people.
[408:04.43]that can be in the server at the same time.
[408:14.02]And there's a lot of things that have to go into place to make it so it works.
[408:18.46]Not enough.
[408:21.22]Once you cross like three or four hundred people in the same spot, you start to run into not possible anymore.
[408:31.42]We'll see.
[408:32.53]It should be a lot of fun.
[408:37.67]We're going to break the server?
[408:40.98]I don't think you will.
[408:45.20]There's a lot of stuff that's being done to help with that, so don't worry.
[408:51.17]I am putting the necessary resources in.
[408:54.95]Let's just put it this way.
[408:56.23]I'm not running this on a Pentium i5 in my basement.
[409:04.12]There's a lot of legit hardware here.
[409:08.60]it has to be but we'll talk about it tomorrow I'll have way more to tell you tomorrow internet jorge or internet George thanks for the 1500 bits please wake up Harold your family misses you we all love you please wake up I get one of these

[410:14.30]It's not.
[410:18.14]But thank you for the $15.
[410:19.72]That's a lot of bits.
[410:21.72]Appreciate it.

[411:24.57]DarkSoul, thanks for the 250.
[411:25.91]Hi, wow, great stream.
[411:26.91]Where do you stand on the twerking fiasco?
[411:30.79]I really didn't know so I can refund these bits if you disagree with me.
[411:35.74]I don't know what this is and I don't know what a twerking fiasco is.
[411:44.03]I don't know.
[411:45.85]I don't know who that is.
[411:46.59]I don't even know what that is.
[411:52.11]I've never heard that name before.
[411:54.21]I don't know what that is.
[411:55.59]I don't know.
[411:58.53]I don't twerk.
[411:59.15]I don't care about twerking.
[412:01.19]I don't care.
[412:01.59]There you go.
[412:02.76]That's my stance.
[412:05.93]Apple Shift thanks for the $2.50.
[412:07.49]Hey, do you have a set date for the next community content night?
[412:11.22]Probably not till January.
[412:12.70]Probably the first week of January.
[412:15.54]Second week of January.
[412:17.34]Just because there's a lot going on.
[412:22.71]There is... I still have to do... I want to get in front of the green screen.
[412:30.54]And that's... I have to wait a little bit.
[412:32.68]I kind of planned this all and then it all fucked up because of my illness.
[412:37.28]But... I... The New Year's Eve stream with the award ceremony.
[412:45.48]The green screen has to happen first.
[412:47.14]The Minecraft has to happen first.
[412:50.22]There's a lot going on in the next, like, four weeks.
[412:53.04]So, and I really, really wanted to get the green screen footage for the next Community Content Night, but if it can't happen, it can't happen, and it'll be for the next one after January.
[413:06.34]And the rumble!
[413:09.00]I'm still making the rumble.
[413:11.51]That's still gonna happen.
[413:14.40]This is going to have to be spread out a little further than I thought.
[413:17.08]There's a lot planned, dude.
[413:22.28]No set date for it, though.
[413:30.17]Let's get the subs going.

[414:17.33]There is no Tier 4.
[414:22.77]Are you going to do the stream awards?
[414:24.11]Oh, yeah.
[414:24.53]That's happening on... That's New Year's Eve.
[414:30.51]In fact, the day or so after the Minecraft stream... The Minecraft stream is happening on the 15th.
[414:40.13]so as of like the 16th or 17th there's gonna be the a new channel is gonna open up in the Discord and we're gonna start to talk about nominations and thankfully there's enough time because remember last year it was like a oh that's what I want to do uh worst of the year best of the year and we did that in like four days you got did you guys remember that we did that in less than three or four days it was like less had to I remember
[415:09.45]It was like December 26th or something when I was like, okay, nominate!
[415:14.55]So this time we're going to have a good full week of nominations.
[415:20.18]And plenty of time to put it together.
[415:22.92]It might have been less than two or three days.
[415:26.54]Last year.
[415:33.15]But I loved it.
[415:36.78]But we'll have more time.
[415:38.66]And that is happening on New Year's Eve?
[415:46.40]But PIN!
[415:46.98]Thanks for the 250, PIN.
[415:48.94]Once I showed up to a black tie symphony for Tchaikovsky in some crappy shorts and a shirt.
[415:57.46]During the intermission they were setting up some sort of after party.
[416:01.52]I was chatting with the help and he let me snag a few glasses of wine for free.
[416:07.98]Little did I know it's the wine that gets you destroyed.
[416:11.00]So I stumbled back into the symphony and it's suddenly the greatest music I've ever heard.
[416:15.63]Afterward, I hung out with some old rich guy who hated his wife and then I got hit on by that guy.
[416:42.07]That's an odd story.
[416:45.01]But that's something that you can tell.
[416:47.87]That's a story to tell.
[416:48.87]This is the best music ever!
[416:57.95]I love this music!
[417:00.64]What does it go like?
[417:01.36]What's that one?
[417:16.44]It's not that.
[417:18.86]But thank you, pin for the 250.
[417:20.08]Thank you, stick, renegade for the 250.
[417:21.37]It's almost that time of year again.
[417:22.67]My birthday's on Christmas.
[417:24.09]Since there's no Christmas stream, surprise me with a random happy birthday like last year.
[417:28.32]The year before happy birthday sticks renegade and I was- I will remember it.
[417:32.32]And there's not going to be a stream on Christmas, but there will be a stream like probably a few days before Christmas.
[417:37.32]Or like that week before Christmas.
[417:39.00]So you'll get- I'll be live on Christmas.
[417:41.00]Not that- I've just- I've- rewind that. Not going to be live on Christmas, to make that very clear.
[417:44.00]No Christmas stream this year. The Minecraft stream and the New Year's Eve stream is going to be taking the place of anything that would be Christmas related.
[417:50.00]We'll see a few days before Christmas.
[417:52.00]Happy birthday.
[417:55.00]Let's get to the end.
[418:04.39]See you guys tomorrow for the Game Awards.
[418:05.61]We have a couple more bits.
[418:06.37]We have Bot Squire.
[418:08.13]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[418:10.73]It's just me.
[418:13.31]I don't know what I'm doing here.
[418:14.23]Probably playing a thing.
[418:15.43]Game of the Year.
[418:19.23]And those eyes are real.
[418:21.13]They might not be, though.
[418:24.64]Those eyes could be doctored.
[418:28.34]I think they actually are.
[418:33.35]Yeah.
[418:34.63]Somebody fucked up.
[418:35.55]Somebody did something with my pupils.
[418:36.69]That's weird.
[418:44.12]Those things, streams.
[418:46.44]What a hoot.
[418:48.90]Let's examine this for a second.
[418:52.35]I want you to see.
[419:00.69]Let's zoom into the eyes.
[419:04.42]We're going late tonight, damn.
[419:12.95]Why do I still even have this on the desktop?
[419:16.17]So that's the one... I can't believe I thought this was real.
[419:21.11]I can't fucking believe I thought that was real.
[419:32.10]That's not the image, though.
[419:34.69]See, people have gotten smart and... They doctor it in a way... Those eyes aren't real.
[419:50.97]Right?
[419:51.79]I don't think they are.
[420:03.55]I don't... I don't... It's just pupils.
[420:07.29]There's nothing... There's no definition to the... It's just pupils.
[420:19.61]You have a shitty camera.
[420:21.51]Hey.
[420:23.47]Don't be mean to my camera.
[420:28.60]Hey, thank you, pen, for the $2.50.
[420:30.72]Is this doctored?
[420:32.14]Hold on.
[420:35.30]Nope.
[420:35.72]Oh my god.
[421:04.64]Where's my spine?
[421:21.86]Beer belly and nerd neck.
[421:32.15]Okay.
[421:33.69]I'm out of here.
[421:34.83]I'm out of here.
[421:36.43]Is this doctored?
[421:37.47]I don't know.
[421:37.97]Where are you guys getting these?
[421:46.60]Hold on.
[421:51.70]Let me see if this one's doctored.
[421:56.11]What is this called?
[422:01.27]Where is it?
[422:14.33]I mean, that's where the image comes from.
[422:18.02]I think that they fucked with it, though.
[422:20.42]They fucked with it.
[422:21.32]Look at the mouth.
[422:22.74]You did- This is doctored.
[422:24.38]Look at the mouth.
[422:27.76]This 100% has been doctored.
[422:28.54]No way.
[422:42.85]Alright, good.
[422:43.29]I'll see you tomorrow for the game rewards.
[422:45.32]I can't wait.
[422:50.22]Oh, we actually have a couple more bits.
[422:51.30]Pin, thanks for the 250.
[422:52.12]Right, I didn't even say it.
[422:54.04]Thanks for the 250, though.
[422:56.58]Say, ha!
[422:57.24]I used to get yelled at all the time when I was like 10.
[423:00.30]Because I would run straight skeleton necro on Diablo II, go to cow runs, and kill the cow king.
[423:07.65]Wow, you're the worst kind of person in the world.
[423:14.00]You... You went in there, you killed the Cow King on purpose?
[423:20.12]Wow.
[423:22.36]That's unbearable.
[423:23.28]I can't believe you would do something like that.
[423:26.07]You dick!
[423:32.39]Those of you that don't know, the Cow King, if you killed the Cow King in a server... Nobody else in that game could play the Cow- couldn't make the Cow Lover ever again.
[423:43.12]You essentially turned off everybody in that game from being able to physically open the portal again.
[423:48.46]You had to make another character.
[423:51.53]That was back when you could have like 20 skeletons and it would lag everyone out.
[423:55.33]It was called the Lagromancer.
[423:57.51]I never understood why everyone was upset with me and because I was having the time of my life.
[424:06.71]I miss playing Diablo II Necromancer.
[424:10.50]Having 50 things on screen, run around, you just don't have to eat a sandwich and play the game.
[424:18.98]Maybe one day I'll do, like, a hardcore Diablo II thing.
[424:22.88]Which is being anyone that wants to play.
[424:26.02]And I just play, uh, Necromancer.
[424:31.88]Wait, this would just be Fuck the King again, except I'm a Necromancer this time.
[424:43.03]D2 Paladin.
[424:44.19]Yeah, it is.
[424:48.33]That sounds like the worst stream ever.
[424:52.51]Hey.
[424:54.29]Come on.
[424:56.05]What time do the game awards start?
[424:57.99]5.30 Pacific.
[425:00.27]They start at right game.
[425:01.47]Let's see.
[425:06.34]The game awards are... Yep.
[425:11.28]8.30 p.m.
[425:12.14]Eastern, 5.30 Pacific.
[425:16.64]I'll see you for that stream.
[425:23.27]Yeah, 8.30 Eastern.
[425:25.79]Am I gonna stream before that?
[425:27.51]I will not be streaming before that.
[425:30.34]Before that, I'm gonna be in the Minecraft server.
[425:34.89]getting stuff ready.
[425:36.15]Because that stream is happening in like four days.
[425:40.91]So I need to take some time to get it ready.
[425:44.77]But I'll be live, I would assume, like at least ten minutes or so before the stream starts so I can get it ready and we can be watching it.
[425:55.35]Did Jerma ever tell the Oreo story?
[425:56.73]One time I ate a bunch of Oreos and threw up in my mother's bed.
[426:02.74]That's it.
[426:07.40]Finally, we have Wembley TTV for the 250 Jerma.
[426:11.16]You've been in a coma for nine years after the helicopter crash.
[426:13.97]We had to plug you into the internet and you're stuck in a VR simulation.
[426:18.41]Please wake up.
[426:20.93]Maybe I will.
[426:31.71]Oh, stream starting soon.
[426:34.55]You'll get moments like this.
[426:41.22]Alright, goodnight guys.
[426:41.76]See you tomorrow for the Game Awards.
[426:43.06]And we'll have a lot to talk about tomorrow after the Game Awards.
[426:45.86]A lot.
[426:46.31]Goodnight.
[426:49.85]Take care.
[427:13.15]Thank you.
