[00:04.93]Hi.
[00:07.17]How are you?
[00:08.25]I'm a little late.
[00:10.59]I'm a little late, but there's a reason why I'm a little late.
[00:17.91]I'm not six hours late.
[00:19.15]I'm two and a half hours late.
[00:21.87]Because I needed a cable.
[00:26.39]I needed to get the table set up.
[00:30.37]a little it's just a little I'm just a little bit late and I don't want to get too loud because I don't know the acoustics of this room and I guess I said acoustics well here's my problem I said oh man 2 p.m or earlier dude 2 p.m sounds good man but then I was like you know I me and Holly was setting up a table what the what are you what are we even doing today
[00:56.89]Okay, there's one guy two nights ago that said we were doing tier lists, and we talked about my candy preferences, my snack preferences, and there's a lot of stuff that I have in F or D, right?
[01:10.32]Don't blame it on Holly.
[01:11.90]I didn't.
[01:12.48]I said we're setting the table up.
[01:14.43]It's my fault.
[01:15.91]I should have taken precedence and started setting the table up yesterday.
[01:20.61]It's my fault.
[01:23.07]How are you?
[01:23.39]I'm doing good.
[01:23.91]I'm doing good.
[01:25.44]There's going to be a system here too.
[01:26.94]So people that, there were a lot of people concerned in the pre-stream chat.
[01:30.54]They're like, dude, um, hold on.
[01:32.12]Wait, wait, wait, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[01:34.08]Don't call me a 2K Andy.
[01:35.12]It's been five seconds.
[01:37.84]A 2K, 2,000 live viewers is a shitload.
[01:41.67]That's a fucking shitload of people.
[01:44.05]So a 2K Andy, that's huge.
[01:46.37]Anyways, ban that guy.
[01:49.67]For like a few minutes.
[01:53.33]Alright, so listen, here we go.
[01:55.41]We've been doing tier lists.
[01:56.33]People in pre-stream were kind of concerned.
[01:57.89]They're like, oh, hey, oh, so you... There's a lot of history.
[02:02.59]Let's back up, like, two days.
[02:05.48]I said I never have eaten a trolley before.
[02:08.68]Trolley.
[02:09.68]A trolley.
[02:10.36]I don't eat these fucking things.
[02:12.90]I put it in F tier.
[02:14.80]Everybody freaked out.
[02:15.42]It was like, dude, you can't put trolley in F tier.
[02:19.92]And I'm like, they're gross.
[02:20.62]It's a gummy worm.
[02:21.20]They're stupid.
[02:22.14]And they said, you eat one on stream and prove that you don't like it.
[02:26.14]I was like, okay, fine.
[02:28.22]But how about we eat 45 of all the candies and snacks and breads, fruits, sodas, stuff that I've put in F tier and see if I'm full of shit.
[02:42.58]He's absolutely insane.
[02:45.52]So there's a lot of stuff here and I'm not ready to show you yet.
[02:54.59]This is gonna kill him.
[02:57.41]Listen, I have a system in place, okay?
[03:01.85]My system is gonna go as follows.
[03:04.23]I'm not gonna eat every piece of candy.
[03:07.47]I'm not gonna open, for instance, the Gross Almond Joy and eat the whole bar.
[03:13.06]I'm not gonna eat the whole bar of Almond Joy.
[03:16.40]Holly loves those.
[03:17.16]She's very upset about this.
[03:20.92]No, I'm not.
[03:21.44]I'm not gonna eat the whole bar of candy.
[03:23.10]Are you crazy?
[03:26.22]We're going to go from category to category.
[03:28.28]We're going to start because there's fruits here.
[03:31.74]We're going to start with fruit.
[03:34.35]I'm going to eat.
[03:35.15]I'm going to take a few bites of fruit and I'm going to move it to the side.
[03:39.99]Something that I forgot completely.
[03:42.49]I need like a separate table to put the stuff that, you know, it doesn't matter.
[03:47.21]It can just stay here.
[03:49.50]I'm not eating the whole thing.
[03:50.98]We're going to go category to category.
[03:52.68]We're going fruits.
[03:54.48]Okay, take one bite.
[03:56.62]Contemplate it for a few minutes.
[03:58.98]Place it on a new tier list.
[04:02.50]Then we're going to probably to chocolate.
[04:05.63]Like Almond Joy, Mounds, Tootsie Roll.
[04:08.79]We're going to go category to category so I don't fucking throw up.
[04:12.65]Look, if for some reason I'm going to fucking puke, it's not going to happen.
[04:16.21]I'm not going to puke.
[04:17.01]Everybody's relaxed.
[04:19.60]Okay, anything that I don't open is gonna get donated.
[04:23.18]So if I don't get to something, if I'm like, you know what, I'm not even gonna fucking open that, I don't want it.
[04:26.54]I'm gonna donate it.
[04:28.54]Anything that is opened is going to be eaten.
[04:32.56]There's gonna be like six months worth of candy here.
[04:36.64]I will eat these Milk Duds even if I don't like them, okay?
[04:40.34]So don't worry.
[04:41.76]All these things are shelf stable for at least like a few weeks, at least.
[04:46.95]So yeah, let's see if I'm full of shit.
[04:52.03]Yeah, I'm not the, like, Holly likes some of this stuff.
[04:54.27]I, you know, I might like it too.
[04:57.51]We'll find out.
[04:59.30]This game sucks.
[04:59.90]Can you play something else?
[05:01.76]I'm not going to puke.
[05:02.86]Everyone's so, I'm not going to fucking throw up.
[05:05.05]Okay, am I on camera yet?
[05:07.13]Okay, hold on.
[05:07.73]I don't think you guys are ready for this reveal.
[05:10.41]Like, look, one guy made this whole fucking stream happen, and that's kind of how it works.
[05:14.78]Okay, this bread, too?
[05:15.82]I actually probably will eat, we're gonna eat this bread, so don't worry.
[05:19.26]Alright, just go ahead and reveal it.
[05:21.60]Let's just, like, let's get it over with.
[05:24.12]Yeah, go ahead, go ahead and show the table.
[05:28.46]Okay.
[05:29.40]Hi.
[05:30.94]There's a lot here.
[05:32.34]Uh...
[05:33.93]I thought maybe a funny joke would have been to do this.
[05:38.11]Are you ready?
[05:39.90]Like, okay.
[05:41.00]This looks like all those food eating videos.
[05:44.04]What the fuck is he doing?
[05:45.40]You're gonna get fat.
[05:46.44]Nice shirt.
[05:47.12]It's the Millennium Falcon.
[05:47.96]Relax.
[05:49.38]Alright, so are you ready?
[05:50.80]All this shit is here?
[05:51.69]I gotta do this.
[05:52.27]This is for me.
[05:53.37]Ready?
[05:53.61]Like... Okay, now somebody edit in a bunch of noodles going in my mouth for the thumbnail.
[06:02.36]Ryan's Toy Review.
[06:07.84]Okay, now hold on, hold on, hold on.
[06:09.72]You gotta edit a big mozzarella stick right here.
[06:11.86]What do you like?
[06:12.30]You know what I mean?
[06:16.24]You gotta get the mozzarella stick.
[06:17.48]Nice plate.
[06:18.66]What?
[06:20.84]I actually kind of don't want to eat that, but whatever.
[06:23.62]Alright, yes.
[06:25.20]Look, I know people are like, don't waste food.
[06:27.62]I'm not going to waste this.
[06:29.14]These bags of, they can be rolled up and sealed and they can be eaten later.
[06:33.22]I'm not going to throw any of this shit away.
[06:34.57]I will eat it.
[06:35.59]This bag of Tootsie Rolls is going to last six years.
[06:39.17]This is going to last six years.
[06:40.39]It's going to last a very, very long time.
[06:41.91]So don't worry.
[06:42.39]I don't want to mess up the setup.
[06:44.89]It looks good.
[06:46.99]How long do Tootsie Rolls even last?
[06:48.39]Does anybody know?
[06:50.66]Happy birthday.
[06:51.48]Drink the hot sauce.
[06:54.72]Alright, let me reiterate what's going on here because people are confused.
[06:59.54]Nice window behind you.
[07:01.38]Just let the sun in.
[07:03.40]They last a long time.
[07:05.10]Six years?
[07:05.86]Hundreds of years.
[07:07.00]Is there an expiration date on Tootsie Rolls?
[07:10.87]Is there actually an expiration date?
[07:16.87]I don't think there's an expiration date.
[07:23.72]The Last Supper.
[07:26.42]Yeah, remember when Jesus ate a bunch of fucking chili cheese Fritos with, like, Joseph and Peter?
[07:32.95]Remember when they had the hot tamales?
[07:34.51]And, like, Jesus, like, Jesus, like, gave a hot tamale to Peter and he fucking, he didn't like it.
[07:38.92]He almost puked.
[07:40.81]No suit?
[07:41.41]Guys, I was already 30 minutes late, and you wanted me to have a suit on, and it was gonna take me like another 40 minutes to get here.
[07:46.83]So, I'm sorry there's no suit, there's no telephone.
[07:49.89]It's alright.
[07:51.27]So, let's go.
[07:52.32]Let's go.
[07:52.64]Here, we're gonna, uh, just to show you kind of how this is gonna work.
[07:55.60]Uh, right here.
[07:57.78]Should be, this should be the tier list, right?
[07:59.80]I'm gonna show them for a second.
[08:02.46]I'm gonna, I'm, we're gonna face my own bullshit.
[08:04.20]We're gonna see.
[08:04.68]I got, I'm, if I don't like it, it's going in F. Star Wars shirt.
[08:08.31]Yeah, I know.
[08:10.21]Suit next stream.
[08:11.19]I'm not just going to wear a suit for fun.
[08:16.21]We got to start with the fruit because it's going to go bad if I don't eat it like right now.
[08:20.03]So everything on that list right there.
[08:23.10]Okay.
[08:26.50]Everything on that list right there is stuff that has been an F. All my F candies, all my F chips, all my F sodas.
[08:35.64]Hey, well, hold on a minute.
[08:36.34]That's not F.
[08:38.42]Why is this up here?
[08:39.18]Oh, right, because I was going to do on stream.
[08:40.91]I was going to do the Coke versus Pepsi taste test challenge.
[08:48.41]I mean, I already know which one I like, but do you?
[08:50.97]Stick around for the whole video to find out.
[08:52.49]I'm doing that at the very fucking end.
[08:56.27]Make sure the fucking algorithm gets me extra views.
[08:59.50]Okay, so this is a Red Delicious apple.
[09:02.50]They taste like shit.
[09:03.60]They smell like shit.
[09:05.24]And they kind of look like shit.
[09:07.04]I know that I don't like Red Delicious.
[09:08.56]Everybody... Who does?
[09:09.63]I don't think anybody does.
[09:11.77]Are they warm?
[09:12.43]These are freezing cold.
[09:13.21]I just got them out of the fridge.
[09:15.51]We're going to find out if I actually really hate these.
[09:18.05]I have not... Okay, here's another thing that's really important to understand.
[09:21.46]Everything that's on this table...
[09:24.07]I don't think I've had in like five to ten years.
[09:26.61]Because I know I don't like it.
[09:29.27]Right?
[09:30.13]Why would you eat something you don't like?
[09:32.79]You ready?
[09:34.07]Red delicious apple first.
[09:35.11]Here we go.
[09:42.00]Hold on.
[09:48.98]Oh, there's a gross spot right there.
[09:50.94]Can you see the gross spot?
[09:52.61]Hold on.
[09:52.87]Let me do that again.
[10:07.52]Okay.
[10:09.82]Okay.
[10:10.18]No, a spit bucket?
[10:12.54]Oh, apples!
[10:15.70]No, I'm fine.
[10:16.20]I'm fine.
[10:16.56]I'm fine.
[10:16.90]I have to swallow it, right?
[10:18.76]I gotta, I gotta, come on.
[10:19.66]I gotta be a man-sized sandwich.
[10:21.06]I gotta swallow it.
[10:23.26]Okay, well, hold on.
[10:24.00]Wait, wait, wait.
[10:24.54]Important.
[10:29.20]Actually, it really isn't even that bad.
[10:31.60]One more.
[10:32.10]I don't, I can't take more than like two bites.
[10:37.82]The skin sucks.
[10:38.54]The skin is like weird.
[10:46.49]These are actually really, they're very sweet.
[10:48.59]I think that's one of the reason why I don't like them.
[10:51.79]Need a big bite.
[10:52.91]Look at how big of a bite that is.
[10:54.05]What kind of mouth do you have if that's the one bite you take?
[10:58.34]Why do I have like a Joker mouth?
[11:03.28]This is not F.
[11:07.66]That's not F. It's not F, though.
[11:18.67]Fuck, this is actually kind of good.
[11:23.91]I wouldn't, like, want to... Okay.
[11:26.11]It's not B. It's probably C. I think Red Delicious Apple's going in C. Listen, the table's shaking, though.
[11:38.00]because like the ac just turned on I thought like the room was shaking yeah that's a c that's a c it's not enough don't no no I got like a million things to eat alright so that's red delicious not enough it's a c they're a little too sweet I'd rather okay for sweet I'd rather just get a green apple which is sweet and sour it's really good alright now we're staying in fruit
[12:07.72]Next up, this is a cantaloupe.
[12:11.34]So this is cantaloupe.
[12:13.58]Cantaloupe is the thing that I always avoid in a fruit cup.
[12:15.84]I always just eat around it.
[12:17.86]I say this is F. I haven't eaten in probably five years.
[12:21.32]Shall we see if I like it?
[12:22.83]Cantaloupe.
[12:26.35]Let me get the apple out.
[12:27.91]Actually, no.
[12:28.59]Put Red Delicious to D. Put it down to D. No, it's D. It's D. The skin is still in my mouth.
[12:34.19]I'm still eating skin.
[12:34.89]D. D.
[12:38.74]I'm like, it's like eating film.
[12:40.02]Yeah, D. Fucking absolutely D. It's still there.
[12:43.46]I've swallowed 15 times.
[12:44.32]Yeah, I've swallowed like 15.
[12:49.87]That's D. Absolutely.
[12:51.11]Red Delicious Apple, D. It's still there.
[12:54.37]There's still skin in my fucking mouth.
[12:55.69]It's in my teeth.
[12:56.13]It's like popcorn.
[12:57.29]Cantaloupe!
[12:57.69]Here we go.
[13:03.50]Oh, juicy.
[13:07.97]Mmm.
[13:09.37]Watch.
[13:09.59]Oh my god.
[13:16.12]That's alright.
[13:28.74]Somebody said this is gonna make me sick?
[13:32.77]I just- I took a bite out of a fucking apple.
[13:35.89]What do you mean?
[13:36.55]Why?
[13:42.83]Cantaloupe is... It's okay.
[13:47.95]You're not using a fork?
[13:49.05]It's a fruit, man.
[13:50.19]What do you want me to do?
[13:50.94]It's not sticky.
[13:53.70]Yeah, it is.
[13:56.04]Okay.
[13:56.58]Cantaloupe.
[13:58.28]I said it was F.
[14:10.52]Oh, my palate cleanser, right.
[14:11.60]I got pickled ginger.
[14:14.14]But no, no, I don't think so.
[14:15.94]I think that I would actually puke if I ate that right now.
[14:19.02]I was going to do this joke where, you know, when you go to a sushi restaurant and you order sushi and you're supposed to use the pickled ginger as a palate cleanser between each item.
[14:25.62]I was like, oh, that's kind of funny.
[14:27.34]What if after every bite I cleanse my palate with some ginger?
[14:31.68]But I don't think that would, I think I would actually throw up if I did that.
[14:34.89]So now we're not doing that.
[14:38.39]Okay, cantaloupe.
[14:39.87]Stop.
[14:41.30]distracting me.
[14:47.32]C. It's juicy.
[14:50.12]It's got a good juice to it.
[14:51.08]I think it's a C. So here we go.
[14:54.55]Here's Cantaloupe 2, which is honeydew melon.
[14:58.81]It's just, I'm going to, it's going to be the exact same score.
[15:01.13]They're the exact same thing.
[15:02.11]They taste exactly the same.
[15:03.09]They're the same exact product.
[15:04.37]They're exactly the same.
[15:08.11]This is fucking awful.
[15:10.44]This is dog shit.
[15:11.12]This is literal dog shit.
[15:14.30]Yeah, this doesn't taste like anything.
[15:15.72]This tastes like nothing.
[15:19.31]All I taste is water and like somebody sprayed Lysol in another room.
[15:28.32]This is awful.
[15:31.20]Honeydew melon.
[15:31.70]Holy fuck.
[15:32.38]Literal F. I'm not changing my goddamn mind.
[15:36.90]It's juicy, but it just tastes like somebody sprayed, like, fucking fabric softener in another room.
[15:42.48]F. F for honeydew melon.
[15:44.84]F. This is a grapefruit.
[15:51.85]The reason why I don't like grapefruit is because it's usually very acidic.
[15:55.17]Like, way too acidic.
[15:56.03]And it tastes like kind of stomach acid.
[15:58.99]And it smells, like, kind of good.
[16:03.29]You're wrong.
[16:05.33]I'm literally sitting here telling you that I'm eating these things and giving you my opinion.
[16:09.07]I'm trying to make, I'm giving you my honest opinions.
[16:10.85]I'm not gonna put any fluff on it.
[16:14.47]Okay, grapefruit.
[16:16.84]All these, remember, everything here I put an F at some point over the last few years.
[16:21.70]Grapefruit, here we go.
[16:26.64]Nice Buzzfeed video.
[16:31.88]I know, but look, I, I, I, I, I, come on.
[16:35.18]Alright, here we go, ready?
[16:36.98]Grapefruit.
[16:38.98]I actually don't want to bite this.
[16:39.94]I like, I know I hate these.
[16:42.04]Let's find out.
[16:42.56]These are, this is fucking awful.
[16:55.73]It just tastes like acid.
[16:58.00]It's, it's, it's acid.
[16:59.63]It's just acid.
[17:01.65]Are these even, okay, are these good for you?
[17:03.41]Are these even good for you?
[17:06.59]Are these good for you?
[17:08.49]You need to put sugar on it.
[17:12.09]No, no, no, no.
[17:13.45]I'm not going to do the thing to make the thing supposed to taste better by adding bullshit to it.
[17:18.45]This is just the way it is.
[17:20.81]What you, okay, oh dude, take the red delicious apple and put caramel all over it and then you'll like it.
[17:25.33]No, I'm sorry.
[17:26.37]I'm sorry.
[17:30.32]These are F. It's bad.
[17:31.80]This stays an F. Where it belongs.
[17:35.22]Yeah, I know.
[17:36.14]You cut the thing in half and you like shake fucking 50 grams of sugar all over the thing so it gets sapped in and seeps into the actual fruit and then you can eat it.
[17:45.70]No, no, no.
[17:47.33]Oh, yeah?
[17:48.23]Are you guys the same people that put sugar on your cornflakes?
[17:52.49]When you order cornflakes, do you put the cornflakes which goes up in front of your table and you put sugar all over it?
[18:00.19]It's the same exact thing.
[18:02.39]It's an animal-style grapefruit.
[18:05.51]It's how you're supposed to eat it.
[18:07.77]I'm just telling you right now, the fruit by itself is enough.
[18:10.75]If you add sugar to something, a shitload of sugar, it's like, yeah, it's probably gonna be better.
[18:15.21]I mean, I could literally probably open up the Fun Dip and, like, put it on there, and then it's, like, the same thing.
[18:21.51]God, Fun Dip sucks.
[18:27.75]So somebody already has a thumbnail?
[18:29.25]Oh, I want to see.
[18:30.55]I'm coming.
[18:45.24]That's pretty good.
[18:46.86]That's pretty good.
[18:50.28]Okay.
[18:53.57]Roots are done.
[18:54.21]I was wrong about cantaloupe.
[18:59.55]Red Delicious, I don't know if they're F. They're okay.
[19:02.22]Alright, in the same realm, we're going to go to... These are cold.
[19:07.50]We're going to do these now.
[19:11.46]So we're going to do sodas.
[19:13.68]This is Diet Mountain Dew, which is wrong.
[19:19.96]Mountain Dew is an F for me.
[19:22.76]So, Diet Mountain Dew is probably, like, not allowed to even be scored.
[19:28.38]Diet Mountain Dew is probably fucking terrible.
[19:33.08]It's disgusting.
[19:35.66]I don't, it sucks.
[19:36.93]Diet Mountain, why would you make Diet Mountain Dew?
[19:39.15]Why?
[19:39.45]What's the point of making a Diet Mountain Dew?
[19:41.05]Alright, listen to that.
[19:43.93]Hold on.
[19:44.31]This is for the video.
[19:45.25]This is for the fucking, like, eating, like, eating channel video.
[19:56.35]Okay, it smells.
[19:56.93]How does it smell?
[19:58.21]Diet Mountain Dew.
[19:58.97]You ready?
[19:59.33]Let's give you the honest opinion.
[20:16.57]She said ew.
[20:23.45]You guys don't understand.
[20:25.58]So, I can hear her in the other room or if she's working on something somewhere else in the house.
[20:33.89]I will do something weird and I'll hear, oh, I can hear it from the other room.
[20:40.37]Oh, this is very bad.
[20:45.02]It's very bad.
[20:47.60]Do I think this is better than actual Mountain Dew?
[20:49.98]Weirdly, yes, I do.
[20:54.94]Okay, Mountain Dew is way too sugary and tastes way... It's just like pure sugar.
[20:59.50]So for some reason, this is better than Mountain Dew.
[21:02.39]What's in it?
[21:03.59]Wait, hold on.
[21:07.15]Aspartame.
[21:07.89]I'm going to go ahead and seal that.
[21:13.11]We're going to go ahead and seal that.
[21:14.19]We're going to just go ahead and seal that.
[21:18.97]Does all diet soda have aspartame in it?
[21:21.58]Put the cap on it.
[21:22.38]I am.
[21:22.88]Somebody will drink this.
[21:28.19]Maybe not.
[21:30.29]Somebody will drink this.
[21:32.12]Diet Mountain Dew?
[21:32.74]Dog shit.
[21:33.20]It's fucking awful.
[21:33.96]It's literally F, but it's better than regular Mountain Dew.
[21:36.06]I'm sorry.
[21:36.52]I just don't like Mountain Dew.
[21:37.78]I know people love Mountain Dew.
[21:38.96]Oh, Mountain Dew is so good.
[21:39.88]I don't like it.
[21:40.30]I think it's bad.
[21:41.24]Here's Squirt.
[21:42.44]Did I put this in F or have I never tried this?
[21:45.06]Oh, it's Grapefruit Soda.
[21:46.28]I don't want it.
[21:51.51]Hold on.
[21:55.55]I got a really funny joke coming up.
[21:57.53]Stay tuned.
[22:01.36]This is Squirt.
[22:03.54]There you go.
[22:04.28]Squirt.
[22:05.06]I guess I never had this.
[22:06.86]Why did I put in an F?
[22:15.67]Oh, that's nice.
[22:18.71]Oh.
[22:23.38]Okay, I drink it.
[22:24.28]I've had Fresca before.
[22:27.56]Oh, did we put Mountain Dew in F?
[22:29.94]Okay, just making sure.
[22:32.41]Squirt.
[22:33.75]I've had Fresca.
[22:34.39]Fresca's a little too harsh.
[22:35.67]Somehow.
[22:36.63]This is pretty smooth.
[22:37.55]I don't know why I just felt like I was being held hostage.
[22:45.27]I don't know why.
[22:50.35]I just, like, looked up and there's, like, I don't know, I just, like, why am I being held hostage right now?
[22:54.31]Like, what is happening?
[22:58.53]He loves it.
[22:59.25]I actually, it's pretty good.
[23:02.57]Alright, one more sip and then I'll put it away.
[23:13.46]I think this is a solid B. I think Squirt's a solid B. It's not... I can tell... It's bubbly.
[23:27.77]He's breaking from the simulation.
[23:31.15]I think this is a B.
[23:33.48]I would drink this again, and I will because it's gonna go in the fridge and I'm gonna drink it later.
[23:38.85]Ah, Squirt's a bee!
[23:39.49]That's- I'm actually very surprised.
[23:41.33]It's lighter than Fresca somehow.
[23:44.35]I can't hide.
[23:44.87]I literally can't hide.
[23:45.65]Yes, I can.
[23:46.01]Okay.
[23:55.26]I couldn't- there's literally nothing I can do to stop that.
[23:57.80]I could not stop that.
[23:59.08]It was impossible.
[23:59.78]It was literally impossible.
[24:00.90]Should I make it lower grade?
[24:04.06]No, should I make it a lower grade?
[24:05.30]Because like, holy shit, that was like fucking violent.
[24:07.36]I couldn't even, I couldn't stop that.
[24:10.32]Oh, you can mute.
[24:11.18]That's right.
[24:11.68]Imagine if I just mute down here.
[24:25.46]Dude, I would never be able to, like... Okay, we've talked a lot of shit about, like, okay, sponsorships, right?
[24:31.50]Like, I'm going to start doing sponsors, maybe.
[24:33.20]You've seen one.
[24:33.78]Maybe you'll see another at some point, right?
[24:36.30]Like, if I were to fucking just puke down here, this would never be allowed on my stream, ever.
[24:43.35]Even if, like, okay, yeah, you've said some things that you were, like, you were just joking around.
[24:47.21]I drank a squirt and I puked down my shirt, right?
[24:49.91]That would be impossible.
[24:50.79]I couldn't hide that.
[24:53.11]You guys, the second it would be possible, it would be possible.
[24:55.63]Whatever.
[24:56.11]It's a B. I think it's a high B. Alright, sodas.
[24:59.26]We still... No, I'm okay.
[25:04.56]I should be fine.
[25:06.26]This is A&W Cream Soda, which is only good when there's like a little bit of ice cream in it.
[25:16.63]I really don't like this at all.
[25:22.10]bubbles are like still there alright what if I just dude if I puke and like whatever if I have like a soda puke I will live forever okay if I take if I take a big chunk of soda and like the bubbles come up and I puke I live forever I will live forever like that'll be shared for like the next hundred years I will literally be the I'll be the guy that like puked on his stream like with bubble pukes and I will live forever I will never die it'll be impossible for me I live forever
[25:47.84]Okay, hold on.
[25:48.16]This is the joke I was gonna make.
[25:50.15]No, that's disgusting.
[25:50.95]Why would I make that joke?
[25:51.71]I was gonna make it like a fart thing.
[25:53.97]Where I was gonna be like, you know what I mean?
[25:55.73]Like, you know what I'm saying?
[25:59.77]Do you guys want music?
[26:00.48]How do you guys feel?
[26:05.46]You guys want some tunes in the background?
[26:11.14]Cream sort of smells amazing, but I don't like how it tastes.
[26:16.24]No music?
[26:16.92]No.
[26:17.34]No music.
[26:18.72]Okay.
[26:20.02]Alright.
[26:22.15]You guys can put your own soundtrack in the background if you want.
[26:24.09]Okay.
[26:29.67]So here we go.
[26:30.19]This is A&W Cream Soda.
[26:31.75]I actually am a huge fan of A&W Root Beer, but I'm not a big fan of Cream Soda.
[26:35.85]Cream Soda is... You take one sip, and that's enough.
[26:39.12]You've had enough.
[26:40.30]Which I'm sure is going to happen here.
[26:41.28]Because after the first sip, you get immune to the flavor.
[26:44.88]Let's see if it happens.
[26:47.16]One sip, delicious.
[26:48.78]Kind of sugary, way too much, a little too much.
[26:51.18]Second, third sip, I'm immune to the flavor.
[27:02.04]What the fuck?
[27:04.58]Oh my god.
[27:09.96]Huh?
[27:15.15]Oh my god, there's 77- 76 grams of sugar in this bottle.
[27:19.85]Wait, no, yeah.
[27:22.62]76 grams of sugar?
[27:24.42]I thought it was like 40.
[27:26.44]What's in a Coke?
[27:30.16]60.
[27:31.04]65.
[27:33.04]God damn, that's a lot of sugar.
[27:34.37]Okay, so, again, like, my issue with cream soda is, I can tell you, I knew it was gonna be bad.
[27:44.73]It's like syrupy.
[27:46.25]It's thicker than a regular soda.
[27:48.07]It's thick.
[27:52.81]Yeah, now I'm immune to the flavor.
[27:53.81]I taste like kind of sweetness and bubbles.
[27:57.97]The cream soda flavor doesn't exist.
[28:07.37]This goes good on ice cream.
[28:09.98]This goes good on ice cream, I think.
[28:12.64]Is it creamy?
[28:17.23]I mean, I think, like, this sitting at the bottom of vanilla ice cream, like, just, like, in a little pool would be kind of pretty good.
[28:23.55]How are they going to float?
[28:26.37]76 grams of sugar.
[28:27.03]These are all so sugary.
[28:28.93]What is the lowest one?
[28:32.30]Oh, squirt-based.
[28:33.64]63.
[28:33.66]What about Pepsi?
[28:37.08]69.
[28:37.10]65.
[28:38.08]Squirt's got the lowest sugar so far.
[28:42.70]Of course it does.
[28:43.30]Based.
[28:44.94]Alright, that's cream soda.
[28:46.00]It's, uh, it's F. It just is.
[28:49.46]It's just, you can't enjoy, I can't enjoy it.
[28:53.05]I actually, I just really can't enjoy that.
[28:59.01]Okay, if I wasn't drinking it, if it was used as a sauce, sure.
[29:04.20]Okay, bubbles are coming up.
[29:08.24]Nice, nice, based.
[29:10.00]Is it bussin'?
[29:11.54]No, it's not.
[29:14.04]My root beer.
[29:14.70]It's just, yeah, it's kind of just shitty root beer.
[29:17.02]And again, let me be very clear.
[29:18.76]I love A&W root beer.
[29:20.62]I think it's fantastic.
[29:21.66]It's probably the best.
[29:23.04]Mug beats it by a lot, I think.
[29:25.58]But I think it's still incredibly good.
[29:29.34]Based on what?
[29:30.68]Peepo.
[29:32.48]What about Squirt over Cream?
[29:33.78]Well, I mean, Cream Soda is F. This is B. Alright.
[29:39.24]It's time to do...
[29:43.10]No, no, this is good.
[29:43.76]I'm fine.
[29:45.06]I mean, guys, people... Here's the thing.
[29:47.88]A lot of people are concerned about this stream, but I will tell you right now, I have been high and eaten like all this shit before.
[29:56.25]Guys, I've been high and eaten an entire tub of Ben & Jerry's ice cream.
[30:00.35]I think I'm going to be okay.
[30:01.55]Like, I've eaten, like, Cheez-Its, Ben & Jerry's ice cream, like, banana cream pie in the same night with Cheez-Its and shit.
[30:11.07]So, like, I think I'll be fine.
[30:12.44]Especially if I don't do that much.
[30:14.62]I know I don't like Diet Coke, but I put it in F, so I have to remember why.
[30:17.82]I actually would... I'll use that as a sauce.
[30:23.90]He's high right now.
[30:26.88]Does your doctor know about this?
[30:32.65]You want to call my doctor and say, hey, hey, hey, hey, doctor, yeah, I'm just very concerned.
[30:38.18]I wanted to call you about a few things.
[30:39.76]Oh, what is it?
[30:40.28]What can I help you with?
[30:42.60]I'm eating Almond Joys and I'm eating a bunch of candy today.
[30:45.94]I'm eating a Tootsie Roll.
[30:47.04]I'm eating one bite of an Almond Joy and taking a sip of cream soda.
[30:49.86]Am I going to be alright?
[30:52.04]I'm going to hit it.
[30:56.94]He's going to hang up on me.
[30:58.90]This is Diet Coke.
[31:01.70]Don't blow up.
[31:04.67]Okay.
[31:04.79]Dude, you're gonna have to go to the emergency room.
[31:11.75]No, I'm fine.
[31:17.56]Guys, do you understand that there are people that, like, drink, like, five of these in a day?
[31:24.00]All of the, okay, all the concerned Andes in here, how many fucking monsters did you have today?
[31:28.37]How many monsters did you have today?
[31:32.75]How many of those have you had today?
[31:35.80]Mm-hmm.
[31:37.02]Interesting.
[31:39.30]Don't take a sip out of cream soda, Jeremy.
[31:41.20]But like... Oh, yeah.
[31:44.49]Monster.
[31:45.19]Extra fire.
[31:46.51]Whatever the fuck it is.
[31:49.29]Zero.
[31:49.75]Zero.
[31:50.17]Zero.
[31:50.61]Zero to my entire life.
[31:53.07]Alright.
[31:53.27]Well, whatever.
[31:53.73]You understand.
[31:54.17]This is Coke and it's F. This is Diet Coke.
[31:56.39]Whoa.
[31:56.87]Be careful.
[31:57.23]Yeah, it's F. It sucks.
[32:05.69]Not changing my opinion on Diet Coke.
[32:07.65]Diet Coke just tastes like regular Coke that went through like a Brita water filter.
[32:12.93]It's a, it's, it's, it's, no, no, I don't think so.
[32:16.56]F. F. I wouldn't want to drink a whole one of these.
[32:27.72]You know what I mean?
[32:30.16]I don't, I don't want to drink a whole one of these.
[32:33.94]People drink a shitload of this.
[32:36.08]This, like, sucks.
[32:41.87]Zero calories.
[32:44.47]How many calories are in just a regular Coke?
[32:45.89]240.
[32:47.39]This sucks.
[32:55.49]That's what the mini cans are for?
[32:56.67]Yeah, dude.
[32:58.01]Okay.
[32:58.99]People, let me tell you something.
[33:01.47]The mini cans and the mini little ones, that's good.
[33:04.43]That's good shit.
[33:05.27]That's fine.
[33:05.67]Drink one of those.
[33:06.53]You can make those go a long way.
[33:07.77]You know how?
[33:08.13]I'm going to give you a tip here.
[33:10.08]Here's a tip.
[33:11.20]Get a big cup like this and fill the fucking thing with ice.
[33:20.30]puke.
[33:21.79]No, I'm not going to puke.
[33:22.93]It's literally just bubbles.
[33:25.29]Every time I drink soda, I get like fucking gassy.
[33:27.46]Okay.
[33:28.08]So don't everybody freak out.
[33:30.50]You get.
[33:32.75]You get a big cup like this and you fill the fucking thing with ice.
[33:36.01]I'm talking to the brim.
[33:37.85]When you pour in half of that goddamn can, it's going to fill the whole thing and you can enjoy it for like an hour if you want to, right?
[33:44.55]You don't have to drink that much soda.
[33:46.06]Fill ice and dilute it.
[33:47.26]It's fine.
[33:48.20]A little bit of dilution is fine.
[33:49.42]It's not going to make you sick.
[33:51.10]Why would it make you sick?
[33:52.74]Get a bucket.
[33:53.32]I'm not, I don't need a bucket.
[33:54.34]F. Alright.
[33:57.26]The last thing I'm going to do is I'm going to, this has nothing to do with the tier list.
[34:04.00]this over here yeah it's f we're gonna do the coke versus Pepsi blind taste test I actually think I might need you to come in here I I I'll know I'll know right okay hold on let's open them both so I I don't want to I don't have any bias here this is the coke should I go
[34:30.51]Oh, the shape, right.
[34:31.51]Yeah, the different shapes.
[34:32.97]Ah, it should be fine.
[34:33.65]I'll just grab it weirdly.
[34:34.43]Okay.
[34:39.68]Okay.
[34:39.86]This is Pepsi.
[34:41.38]This is Coke.
[34:43.54]Yeah, I'm going to drink pretty much all this stuff.
[34:46.96]Okay, so I'm going to hand... Actually, here.
[34:50.46]Probably easier if you're just ready.
[34:51.82]So I'm going to close my eyes.
[34:53.46]And I don't want to know which one you're handing me.
[34:54.80]Okay.
[34:56.80]It could be either one.
[34:57.64]And just stick it in the cup holder.
[35:10.27]oh I know that taste that is the classic classic coke taste okay take it I can tell when it's coke because it hurts you got it okay
[35:39.90]Why is this like raspberry?
[35:42.94]This is raspberry.
[35:44.00]Is this raspberry flavor or something?
[35:48.40]What?
[35:48.82]I don't like that one.
[35:59.20]I'm done with that one.
[36:01.44]Let me see the other one, please.
[36:03.18]Yeah, let me do the other one one more time.
[36:12.90]This is definitely Coke.
[36:14.24]Yeah, of course it is.
[36:15.42]Of course it is.
[36:15.96]This is the classic Coke flavor.
[36:17.32]The other one was raspberry.
[36:18.44]What is it?
[36:20.89]Yeah, that Pepsi is way worse than Coke.
[36:23.41]Coke is way better.
[36:27.99]Okay, well, first of all, like this like tastes like it has other flavors in it.
[36:33.06]Coke kind of hurts.
[36:34.86]When you drink Coke, it has that kind of like, it's like a bite, which I like way more than Pepsi.
[36:42.92]Now that I can see it, let me see.
[36:51.41]This tastes almost like vanilla.
[36:53.81]It tastes like there's something else in it.
[37:00.89]Citric acid.
[37:01.63]Is there citric acid in Coke?
[37:05.05]Bro, no there's not!
[37:10.48]no that's the difference it's citric acid that's the difference there's citric acid in Pepsi and this this this phosphoric acid in coke that's why it tastes like kind of like it's like a like like fruity okay coke's way better coke is uh like a uh Pepsi is like it's not bad I I did I put it in f I got high for a second
[37:39.61]probably thought I was about to puke everybody's probably like oh shit he's puking no I just wanted to hide because I didn't want to burp into the fucking microphone uh Pepsi is a c minus it's not f it's not fair to call it f coke is way better go down to like fucking puke alright there's your sodas the one that surprised me is probably squirt the first time I've probably ever had it
[38:08.41]I move away from the mic to put the Coke cap on.
[38:11.17]Yeah, I got it.
[38:13.56]These all go in the fridge.
[38:16.10]I will absolutely drink all the Pepsi.
[38:17.56]I'll drink all the Coke.
[38:19.44]This will be used as a sauce.
[38:20.84]I'll drink all this.
[38:24.78]I'll drink all that.
[38:26.36]I'll have to.
[38:27.72]Okay.
[38:29.24]Coke is A. Pepsi is C.
[38:32.62]That's my opinion.
[38:33.48]I know you probably love Pepsi, but it tastes, it's got fruits in it somehow.
[38:36.81]It tastes like it's got fruits in it.
[38:37.85]So that's it.
[38:38.93]What's in here?
[38:41.81]Oh, my green tea powder.
[38:43.63]Perfect.
[38:44.41]Alright.
[38:44.65]There's your soda.
[38:45.17]There's your fruit.
[38:46.43]We're going to move on.
[38:47.07]Let's stay in the sugar realm.
[38:48.23]Why not?
[38:49.72]Let's move to chocolate.
[38:53.68]This is Almond Joy.
[38:54.48]These are both, to me, these are both, old people eat these.
[39:01.19]This is like, I imagine an old guy sitting just kind of in a rocking chair, just like... They're like, these are like 19, like 20 or something.
[39:09.24]These are all old, and old people eat these, and I don't like them.
[39:13.44]And they're made by this, look, you can tell, they're the same, the same game company made these.
[39:17.23]This is like an asset flip.
[39:18.45]It's a Unity flip.
[39:21.79]It's an asset flip.
[39:22.51]Alright, this is Almond Joy.
[39:28.21]I'm only gonna take like one bite of this.
[39:31.78]Oh, it's like a little sectioned off here.
[39:33.16]Okay, so this is what it looks like?
[39:36.96]This is what an Almond Joy is?
[39:38.30]I don't think I've ever opened this.
[39:47.40]Have I ever eaten?
[39:48.04]I feel like I've eaten this and hated it.
[39:50.28]Why is there a coconut on it?
[39:54.18]It's coconut?
[39:56.08]Alright, here we go.
[39:56.84]Almond Joy.
[39:57.52]Almond Joy, everybody.
[39:59.57]Here we go.
[40:11.99]very mushy in the middle very mushy do you want one she's like you want the other half of this wait it's definitely not f it's too it's like too it's like too mushy there's like too much fiber in the middle I know but coconut is like
[40:42.14]I like coconut water and coconut milk.
[40:43.38]Hey, you mind the rest?
[40:45.80]Here, take that.
[40:48.96]Actually, the more that I'm sitting here... I kind of hate it, but I want another one.
[40:57.66]Hold on.
[41:02.08]I'm very texture-based.
[41:09.92]Same reason why the apple, Red Delicious, it's like the skin.
[41:16.58]If I have to sit there and like chew your product for more than like two or three straight minutes, I usually don't.
[41:25.69]Because now, here's the problem.
[41:27.41]Okay, well, gross.
[41:28.61]Here we go.
[41:28.99]Here's the problem.
[41:30.19]Problem.
[41:30.67]Problem.
[41:31.07]Problem alert.
[41:32.87]All the chocolate is gone.
[41:34.77]All the almond is gone.
[41:36.63]The only thing that's left...
[41:39.13]is fibers of coconut just mushed together in my mouth.
[41:45.30]Mm-hmm.
[41:46.60]Still there.
[41:49.96]Nope.
[41:52.38]Nope.
[41:53.58]Sorry.
[41:56.36]I would treat this the same way that I usually treat Milk Duds.
[42:00.25]Which, by the way, I thought I just dumped them.
[42:03.81]Coming up soon.
[42:06.01]And make sure you stay to the end of the video for me to tell you which one I like more.
[42:09.71]I'm still chewing it.
[42:14.65]Still chewing it.
[42:15.17]Still there.
[42:21.62]Oh, it's slower.
[42:22.40]It's getting slowly down past D. It's just D. It's D. I'm sorry.
[42:30.96]I'm still chewing the fucking coconut fibers.
[42:33.99]Almond joy.
[42:34.37]Honey, I'm sorry.
[42:35.27]Needs a D. Oh, it's still there!
[42:38.70]I don't want to eat this!
[42:54.41]I'm trying to swallow it!
[42:56.33]I want someone to count how many times I just had to chew that from when it went in.
[43:00.29]That first, okay, when I bit it, and it was like the textural, like the mush of the coconut, the fibers, the chocolate, the almonds, that was a B. That bite was a B. That was a B+.
[43:10.31]Then, the same problem I have with the fucking Red Delicious Apple, it stays in your mouth forever, and you just chew up a bunch of fucking paper.
[43:18.43]That's what it's... Hmm?
[43:20.51]It is good value.
[43:22.03]If you like chewing coconut.
[43:25.55]That was a B+, initial reaction, and then like a D+.
[43:30.03]So I don't think it's F. F is kind of unfair.
[43:39.30]He's muted?
[43:39.92]No, I'm not.
[43:43.50]Holly is based.
[43:44.64]Holly, you should get him.
[43:47.36]It's a skill issue.
[43:48.34]It's not fucking... It's not like Apex.
[43:53.20]What are you talking about?
[43:56.32]The initial bite was a B, the rest of it was like a D-.
[43:59.28]So therefore it has to go into C-.
[44:01.28]I'll be fair to it.
[44:02.08]I will be fair to it.
[44:02.74]It's a C-.
[44:04.52]I'm not going to go to the store and buy a C- though.
[44:07.74]If somebody presented me with an Almond Joy, I'd go, oh, thanks.
[44:10.90]In my brain, I'd secretly be going, fuck that guy.
[44:14.79]But I'd be like, thanks, and I would eat it, and it'd be alright.
[44:18.25]Almond Joy is C-.
[44:19.33]It's not an F. But stay in the same category.
[44:21.55]There's Mounds now.
[44:22.81]Oh, more coconut from the same asset flip.
[44:27.37]So what's the difference between Mounds and Almond Joy?
[44:30.27]No almonds.
[44:32.99]That's the only difference.
[44:33.91]It might be dark chocolate.
[44:34.59]I don't know.
[44:36.47]Oh, wait.
[44:36.67]The only difference is there's just no almonds in this.
[44:39.15]Yeah.
[44:39.51]It's just the... The Almond Joy is better.
[44:43.55]What?
[44:44.17]Yeah.
[44:44.29]Unless you don't like almonds.
[44:49.91]Oh, it is!
[44:50.55]It really... It just is that.
[44:52.56]But I liked the almonds in this.
[44:53.88]This is gonna be F. Alright, this is... This is Mounds.
[44:56.90]Mounds again.
[45:00.38]It's dark chocolate with no almonds.
[45:02.16]Oh, I don't really like dark chocolate.
[45:03.64]And I didn't like the mushy coconut.
[45:04.94]Here we go.
[45:05.36]Okay.
[45:18.79]You know those, like...
[45:21.16]Chocolate shops.
[45:22.26]You go in and they have like the, oh, pick like 10.
[45:24.86]Pick a box of 10.
[45:25.50]And they have like the little things where it's like, oh, this one's filled with raspberry goo.
[45:29.46]This one has like fucking peach schnapps in it.
[45:32.39]That just reminds me of one of those.
[45:38.17]Hold on.
[45:46.20]This is better.
[45:46.58]Yeah, it's better.
[45:51.89]The dark chocolate goes with the coconut way better than the yellow one.
[45:55.77]And I'm not even a dark chocolate fan.
[45:59.83]Is he wearing pants?
[46:00.55]Of course not.
[46:08.78]These were both an F. But I'm enjoying a D. Oh, God.
[46:16.88]It's already there.
[46:19.16]Again, same problem.
[46:21.54]Alert.
[46:22.72]Red alert.
[46:23.34]Okay, if they just... If there was, like, coconut-flavored juice in the middle, these would be, like, B. If this was, like, coconut, like, smooth coconut-flavored, like, nougat, this would be, like, an A. Just swallow it.
[46:48.09]Dude, I can't.
[46:50.46]You have fucking George Washington teeth.
[46:52.62]That's why I don't, man.
[46:54.00]It's just, it's coconut.
[46:54.96]Coconut sucks.
[46:57.12]Get better at chewing.
[46:57.92]No, I'm, I'm gonna, this is a man-sized sandwich here.
[47:11.25]That first bite was better than this first bite.
[47:13.89]I put that in D. This is going to C. It's not enough.
[47:17.18]It's, it's like, it's like a C, a C.
[47:20.46]I was about to take another bite.
[47:21.98]Shouldn't that prove something?
[47:25.22]Chew it less.
[47:25.78]Okay.
[47:26.54]How many times do you want me to chew this?
[47:29.16]What are they saying?
[47:32.66]Like, how many times should I chew this before swallowing it?
[47:39.04]120.
[47:39.24]No, all the chewandies in chat here, how long should I chew this for?
[47:45.35]60 times?
[47:51.15]Enough so you can spell it 30 times.
[47:52.58]30, 30, 30.
[47:52.74]I'm going to chew this.
[47:55.76]I'm seeing a lot of like 20, 30.
[47:56.74]I'll chew it.
[47:57.81]30, 27, 20.
[47:57.91]We'll go for 30.
[47:58.41]Okay.
[48:24.00]I can't.
[48:27.30]I fucking can't.
[48:35.48]I can't.
[48:36.00]It's too much.
[48:39.79]This hurts to watch?
[48:40.93]Why?
[48:41.11]Because I don't like your favorite shitty candy?
[48:46.11]It's not shitty.
[48:46.75]I'm kidding.
[48:47.49]I'm kidding.
[48:47.89]I'm kidding.
[48:48.25]It's not dentures.
[48:48.99]I don't have a baby mouth.
[48:50.05]It eats coconut, dude.
[48:51.47]And coconut is fibrous.
[48:53.74]coconut yeah it is for old people that's what I'm talking about because old people just sit there and they go yeah that's why it's for old people because they chew the fuck out of it alright it's a it's a c
[49:20.93]And that's all I have to say.
[49:21.95]And I'm not saying anymore.
[49:22.93]And you won't be able to get me to change my opinion.
[49:25.42]Okay, chocolate.
[49:25.92]What else we got?
[49:26.34]Tootsie Rolls.
[49:26.98]Why not?
[49:27.14]Yeah, they're right here.
[49:35.10]This dude's so out of touch.
[49:38.88]Why?
[49:38.96]Because now I'm going to be fishing coconut out of my gums for the next hour?
[49:50.76]Tootsie Rolls were, were they F or D?
[49:52.62]I think they were low D or high F. Just a, see, nothing here.
[49:58.43]Not just, no strings or anything.
[49:59.93]See, there's nothing here.
[50:00.59]See?
[50:03.79]Tootsie Roll.
[50:04.79]Just a regular, just generic Tootsie Roll.
[50:12.27]Why did you buy so many?
[50:16.00]Do you know how hard it is to buy one of these?
[50:19.94]You don't let us tell them.
[50:21.86]You have to buy a bag that's either this or 30 pounds.
[50:27.96]They don't make little Tootsie Rolls.
[50:31.23]Let me get the coconut out of my mouth.
[50:39.31]Okay.
[50:40.71]This is not man-sized.
[50:41.69]It doesn't matter.
[50:44.23]Okay, coconut's gone.
[50:48.24]Remember, mouth feel is very important.
[50:49.54]I'm a very texture-based person.
[51:13.78]It's fun.
[51:15.72]It's fun to do.
[51:20.27]Doesn't taste very good.
[51:23.71]You know why I don't like Tootsie Rolls?
[51:26.23]Figuring it out right now.
[51:29.13]It tastes more like candy than it does chocolate.
[51:37.00]You want one?
[51:40.40]Oh, the flavor, yeah.
[51:41.78]I was told that I did this wrong because there's like the flavored Tootsie Rolls are better.
[51:47.26]Not the default ones.
[51:51.12]This doesn't taste like chocolate to me.
[51:54.37]It tastes less like chocolate.
[51:55.53]Like, this is not a chocolate to me.
[51:58.15]This is like a candy.
[52:00.37]This... This was a chocolate.
[52:03.49]This is chocolate-flavored candy.
[52:06.33]If that makes any sense.
[52:08.39]So that's why I kind of don't like it.
[52:15.82]Midgees?
[52:17.72]What is a midgee?
[52:20.19]Is this like... like from... what countries did I get these from?
[52:24.97]Midgi?
[52:25.35]Is that like... is that like Finnish?
[52:28.52]Is that Finnish for like middle?
[52:32.10]Midgi!
[52:32.54]What is that?
[52:39.23]It's mid.
[52:47.66]It's mid.
[52:49.60]Is it a different language?
[52:52.40]Is it Australian?
[52:55.42]This is not, Australian is English.
[52:59.09]It's mid-grade.
[53:05.39]It's mid-grade.
[53:08.53]It's not mid, alright.
[53:13.46]We are, we are, don't say it's mid-grade.
[53:15.48]I didn't say that.
[53:17.63]I didn't say that.
[53:18.23]Tootsie Roll, if you're watching the stream right now, I didn't say mid-grade.
[53:22.31]Hold on.
[53:24.65]They said that.
[53:25.25]I didn't say it.
[53:27.63]It's F. I said it was F, but they're saying mid-grade, which is not what I said.
[53:35.38]I said it's F. That means that I don't like them very much.
[53:38.56]That means I actually don't like them.
[53:44.19]I see the appeal, though.
[53:49.18]I just, I just wouldn't want, I just, okay, look, if they were, these are going to go like this.
[53:57.91]Yeah.
[53:58.23]Okay.
[53:59.21]So this is what's going to happen to the Tootsie Rolls.
[54:00.81]They're going to roll up like this.
[54:03.79]They're going to go into a box and they're going to sit in a closet forever.
[54:09.93]They expire in 2024.
[54:13.53]I'm going to go into the closet sometimes.
[54:15.37]I'm going to go into the pantry sometimes.
[54:17.69]And I'm going to look at it a year from now and go, oh, yeah, sure, I'll eat one.
[54:26.09]I'll eat one of these, maybe two of these in the next year.
[54:30.86]Trick-or-treaters?
[54:32.28]No, no trick-or-treaters don't want little Tootsie Rolls.
[54:36.26]The trick-or-treaters want king-size Reese's.
[54:38.22]That's what they want.
[54:40.09]Alright, this Tootsie Roll, they're F. They will be probably eaten eventually.
[54:46.33]No trick-or-treating wants a Tootsie Roll, come on.
[54:50.05]Oh, stay tuned to the end of the video.
[54:54.57]Alright, what else?
[54:55.17]Yeah, we have a couple.
[54:55.81]Alright, Snow Caps.
[54:58.60]I know that we've got somebody here that's a big fan of Snow Caps.
[55:04.70]I just remember these being like too crunchy.
[55:08.50]I remember, yeah, I hate these.
[55:11.53]I'm glad I'm solidifying a lot of opinions here.
[55:14.07]The packaging is cool.
[55:16.97]Here we go.
[55:24.23]Snowcap.
[55:32.04]The chocolate's kind of... I don't like the chocolate very much.
[55:47.27]I'll probably eat this whole box when I get high next time.
[55:50.95]They're like weirdly good.
[55:53.33]But in a way that I don't want to eat them right now.
[55:56.99]The texture is good.
[55:59.39]I don't like the chocolate very much though.
[56:02.67]This is a flyover state candy.
[56:21.19]they're just chocolate chips covered in they're just yeah they're just chocolate chips covered in like a these weird like fucking I don't want to say it because it's like mean I don't want to say because it's mean if I say it it looks like it's you know what I'm going to say right it looks like chocolate chips covered in no
[56:52.18]You want some?
[56:53.24]Yeah, take whatever you want.
[56:55.88]Oh, you want some snow caps?
[56:57.44]Oh.
[56:59.30]My girl loves snow caps.
[57:00.12]No, I don't know what they taste like.
[57:01.24]Oh, you don't know what they taste like?
[57:02.35]Here you go.
[57:04.47]Alright, we need your honest opinion.
[57:08.15]What do you think?
[57:14.11]Oh, here.
[57:14.61]Eat another one on camera.
[57:17.21]On camera?
[57:18.66]Yeah.
[57:18.84]You could have eaten anything.
[57:19.54]You could have just eaten anything.
[57:32.54]I think it's like I like the I like the crunchy texture is good, right?
[57:38.98]This is movie theater candy you but you get this in the movie theater and you watch a movie And you eat like half of you don't wait isn't there hold on a second.
[57:48.77]Don't people sprinkle this into popcorn.
[57:50.29]Oh
[57:52.06]That's like the whole thing.
[57:52.78]You sprinkle this into popcorn, right?
[57:56.40]Hmm.
[57:59.70]I could understand that, actually.
[58:02.30]These aren't F. These don't belong in F. They're just like... Okay, I gotta stop eating them.
[58:09.13]I've eaten too many.
[58:10.77]The fact that I keep eating them.
[58:22.37]I actually kind of like these.
[58:28.24]How tall is Holly?
[58:29.18]6'2"?
[58:30.28]6'3"?
[58:31.00]Fuck, these are not F. I've got to stop eating them.
[58:41.18]I know those are good.
[58:42.94]It took me a minute to understand.
[58:44.12]It took me like... I was going to make fun of them.
[58:48.96]I can make fun of them now, right?
[58:49.92]Because I like it.
[58:51.00]I like them.
[58:51.54]So these are B. Snowcaps are B. But they look like chocolate with mold on it.
[58:58.29]They look like chocolate with mold all over it.
[59:00.19]I can say that because they're telling you I enjoy them.
[59:02.57]But they have an interesting look.
[59:07.72]Where does it go?
[59:10.72]Below squirt.
[59:11.54]B. Are you standing right now?
[59:20.07]uh yeah those are b those are those are very good those are very good I want to you know you know what get I got to get those away from me I think I'm going to eat another one take those take those I think I'm going to go for another couple of those oh did you did they open it's like they all dump up

[59:53.60]What the fuck, man?
[59:54.56]Why do apples do this?
[59:56.94]Why do apples do this?
[59:58.54]This is like... Is that on your mouth?
[60:00.76]No, this is not from my mouth.
[60:03.45]Apples are so unappetizing, aren't they?
[60:05.05]Alright, that's good.
[60:06.93]That's fine.
[60:07.27]I just don't want that to be on camera, because I don't want to make you guys look... You guys are gonna be, like, grossed out.
[60:10.19]Alright, what else we got?
[60:11.69]Snowcaps.
[60:12.85]They were F of... They were F. Another B. So, opinions can change, right?
[60:17.71]Whopper time.
[60:18.39]It's time for Whoppers.
[60:21.15]Whoppers and Milk Duds are in the same category for me.
[60:23.19]And then these chocolate chip cookie dough bites are going to be gross.
[60:28.15]Whoppers.
[60:29.75]Another old person candy.
[60:30.99]Another candy you eat if you're over the age of like 50.
[60:34.30]Or if you go to the movie theater and you really just kind of don't know what to order.
[60:41.64]And there's like 10 people in line behind you.
[60:43.78]So you just go...
[60:46.05]Uh, Whoppers, I guess.
[60:47.07]And then you go, fuck.
[60:51.29]This is an easy F. I mean, they are.
[60:52.97]They were F for me before.
[60:58.43]Here we go.
[60:58.77]Whoppers.
[61:00.35]It's like a malted kind of chocolate ball, right?
[61:02.63]Let's see.
[61:05.09]This says, be an original.
[61:07.47]I feel like I'm kind of an original.
[61:12.56]They're already, look, they're already speaking to me.
[61:16.87]They think I'm original.
[61:17.78]They think they said it.
[61:18.52]It's like sandy.
[61:31.37]Kind of sandy.
[61:33.81]Although it dissipates very, very, very quickly.
[61:38.47]Suck on it first?
[61:40.51]Let it melt.
[61:50.74]Hold on.
[61:51.74]Hold on.
[61:52.16]Hold on.
[62:02.35]Ooh.
[62:05.45]Wow, that was a good tip.
[62:19.86]Grandpa's messed up with, like, food to his mouth?
[62:22.30]Uh, no.
[62:24.66]You're turning green.
[62:30.68]Jesus.
[62:35.68]Jesus.
[62:40.02]Now the sandy part is soft.
[62:47.59]Jeez.
[62:49.67]Oh.
[62:52.07]One more.
[62:53.71]One more, one more, one more.
[62:54.59]That's it.
[62:54.97]One more.
[63:11.14]Yeah, these are good.
[63:15.16]I was eating them wrong the whole time, my whole life.
[63:20.84]I was eating these wrong my entire life.
[63:22.52]I was just eating them and crunching them and going, ugh.
[63:26.02]You gotta let the flavors happen.
[63:28.34]You have to let the flavors happen.
[63:33.83]It's a multi-layered candy.
[63:37.65]See, there's like this nice, it's a nice, it's actually a pretty nice like smooth chocolate on the outside.
[63:42.35]The inside I don't like, but if you let it sit for a minute.
[63:49.41]Jesus, these are good.
[63:55.44]I'm very conflicted right now because these look, like, really good.
[64:14.20]But are they, though?
[64:16.74]They're kind of a little too buttery at the end.
[64:20.96]How do I really feel?
[64:23.06]Let's just see.
[64:25.11]He went from F to C. There's a little too buttery at the end.
[64:31.56]Oh, it's over cantaloupe, for sure.
[64:34.30]It's over Pepsi, for sure.
[64:38.08]Pepsi is above cantaloupe, without a doubt.
[64:41.04]Wait a minute, no, it's not.
[64:41.92]Cantaloupe is way above Pepsi.
[64:44.20]Yeah.
[64:47.70]Stop nitpicking?
[64:48.74]I mean, this whole stream is I'm nitpicking my shitty opinions on my F-tier candies.
[64:57.59]I don't yeah I'm gonna make sure I don't drop any of this which I haven't so that's good put that over here alright so we have a little we have only a couple more chocolates left
[65:09.59]Very cool.
[65:10.99]I'm not looking forward to this because I don't like cashews.
[65:13.05]I know I don't.
[65:13.65]Even though, yeah, you put cashews in F. Of course I did.
[65:16.41]They taste, they're like the meat.
[65:18.57]They taste like meat.
[65:19.27]They're like the meat of the peanut world.
[65:20.86]I'm not looking forward to doing that.
[65:21.88]Okay, so here we go.
[65:24.70]Um, stick that over there for now.
[65:28.42]Right there is fine.
[65:29.32]Alright, so now we got milk duds.
[65:34.97]Milk duds, the problem I have with these is after you put this in your mouth and you chew it up, you want to... I made the reference two days ago.
[65:41.31]You go watch that.
[65:42.21]I'll give you a minute.
[65:43.71]Go watch the VOD from a couple days ago.
[65:46.82]And you will see why I don't like these.
[65:49.56]30% less?
[65:50.24]Oh, no.
[65:51.36]Okay, I thought that said 30% less is in the container.
[65:56.68]Like, what?
[65:57.20]What do you mean 30% less?
[65:59.36]Like, that's like something to advertise?
[66:04.47]So, if- when you eat a Milk Dud, it gets to a point- a part- a pi- a part!
[66:09.36]Whoa!
[66:10.46]Whoa!
[66:13.02]It gets to a point... where they're just kind of chewed up gum, and they look awful.
[66:22.71]Oh, these- wait, are they supposed to look like this?
[66:27.65]Are they supposed to be, like, squished like that?
[66:29.39]Are they supposed to be like that?
[66:33.71]like this.
[66:35.73]These are crushed.
[66:37.63]Are these supposed to be like this?
[66:41.69]These look like they've already been chewed.
[66:44.79]These are supposed to look like that?
[66:49.52]Are you sure?
[66:54.94]Don't they look like they've already been chewed?
[66:58.10]This is what they look like?
[67:01.08]Is it?
[67:01.30]I thought they were supposed to be like circles.
[67:18.89]These are terrible.
[67:20.97]And I mean absolutely awful.
[67:23.97]This might be the worst one of the night.
[67:30.58]I have to be fair, right?
[67:32.28]These might be the worst of the night.
[67:37.70]By a long shot.
[67:43.29]I would rather eat a full bar of mounds than eat like another few of these.
[67:49.23]The texture looks is kind of, they look off.
[67:52.21]Texture's not great.
[67:54.69]Do the same thing this time.
[67:56.69]Okay.
[67:57.03]Do the same thing.
[67:58.05]Okay.
[67:58.99]Okay.
[67:59.65]Hold on.
[68:04.21]It looks like rat shit.
[68:10.62]These are huge.
[68:11.30]Those are like giant.
[68:12.58]Those rats are huge.
[68:14.40]Oh my God.
[68:15.16]Hold on.
[68:19.11]That's like a gigantic sewer rat.
[68:23.15]They look kind of bad.
[68:26.51]These look like they were left in the sun or something.
[68:28.09]Alright, I'll do it the way you guys say it.
[68:29.23]Here we go.
[68:34.10]Again, the old guy has to sit in the chair.
[68:39.42]Oh, hold on.
[68:42.96]Ooh!
[68:50.20]The chocolate is not nearly as good as the Whopper chocolate.
[68:52.38]Not even close.
[68:54.56]This is more Tootsie Roll chocolate.
[68:57.38]Not even close.
[68:59.06]It's still bad.
[69:05.28]Not even close.
[69:07.80]You know why I didn't want to do that?
[69:09.03]Because now I have the caramel here.
[69:18.27]No.
[69:18.41]These are F.
[69:21.83]doing that change my mind of the whoppers is not going to change my mind of milk it's still bad it's still f who eats these I feel like it is like a buzzfeed video and I'm from like like britain or something who no they don't actually americans eat these oh bollocks no why oh it's disgusting no they're actually eating these well I feel like that's what I'm doing
[69:57.42]Oh, the Babe Ruth is right.
[69:58.30]Okay.
[69:58.66]I don't want to... I actually really don't like these.
[70:12.97]And we're making a lot of jokes.
[70:17.44]I mean, we're making a ton of jokes, right?
[70:19.60]I'm trying to be fair because they've been around for a long time.
[70:22.44]Who makes these?
[70:23.82]Who actually?
[70:24.32]They're gluten-free.
[70:25.32]They're gluten-free.
[70:27.45]Hershey makes these.
[70:31.23]It's just not good.
[70:32.89]It's just, I just don't like it.
[70:33.93]I really just don't.
[70:34.43]I'm trying to be very fair, and I just read their F. Oh, that was stuck.
[70:40.53]Oh, did you see that on camera?
[70:43.00]Okay, so now we got Baby Ruth.
[70:45.92]What is in a Baby Ruth?
[70:46.88]Who makes Baby Ruth?
[70:50.84]Dry roasted peanuts, rich caramel, and smooth nougat.
[70:58.10]What is it?
[71:01.68]I didn't say that.
[71:03.32]I did not say this is rat shit.
[71:04.88]Somebody else did and I've read it.
[71:06.06]Baby Ruth.
[71:08.50]Here we go.
[71:10.78]I feel like this is kind of a... This is like a Snickers that like went to the gym for like six months.
[71:19.33]Because like look at this.
[71:20.19]This is full of... Look at that.
[71:22.29]This is full of peanuts.
[71:25.17]A big what?
[71:27.30]Do not say cat shit.
[71:29.50]Don't say it.
[71:30.54]Did you say it?
[71:31.86]Did you say cat shit?
[71:35.04]Oh, I said cat shit.
[71:36.14]I thought I was like pretending to read cat shit.
[71:39.96]Wait, the gopher?
[71:40.96]Caddyshack?
[71:44.40]This looks like the shit in the pool.
[71:45.80]Oh, it's a baby rude.
[71:46.60]That's okay.
[71:49.14]We can't go into this.
[71:50.54]This is biased.
[71:52.71]This looks like a Snickers that has way too much stuff in it, but we'll find out.
[71:58.63]Here we go.
[71:58.99]Excuse me.
[72:00.09]I need total silence, please.
[72:29.84]I'm just like a dry-ass Snickers.
[72:47.26]It's good.
[72:47.62]I feel like this has got more...
[72:56.29]Another thing is like, oh, if you're hungry, eat a Snickers.
[72:59.35]Who's eating Snickers when they're hungry, right?
[73:02.39]I feel like this is what that commercial is actually saying.
[73:07.77]This has way more peanuts than Snickers.
[73:10.68]This feels a little more like filling.
[73:12.02]It's got way more peanuts.
[73:19.08]I love Snickers, and this just kind of just tastes like... You know what this is?
[73:22.52]You know what this tastes like?
[73:24.50]This tastes like a homemade Snickers.
[73:30.20]Like, there's like a YouTube video showing how to make a Snickers, and this is what it is.
[73:35.53]It's not bad, but it's not a Snickers.
[73:38.23]That's what I want.
[73:41.33]I did just say it's a dry-ass Snickers.
[73:42.61]I know.
[73:47.05]Why?
[73:47.35]I'm not gonna... No, you're doing it wrong.
[73:50.13]You have to...
[73:53.37]It's an energy bar Snickers, yeah.
[73:56.19]Alright, it's not F, it's like a... I would eat this.
[74:03.33]I'm gonna save this.
[74:06.19]That's like a... It's a C-.
[74:14.26]That's not a skill issue.
[74:15.38]It's a C-.
[74:18.04]That is... Oh, is it above mounds?
[74:26.04]Oh, fuck.
[74:26.78]This is hard.
[74:31.10]Mounds is... Oh, no, it's not.
[74:32.93]That's hard, because they're both, like, the... I feel like I would rather eat a Baby Ruth, but I feel like Mounds tasted better.
[74:43.29]So, I'd say it's below Mounds.
[74:44.46]Alright, there's that.
[74:49.56]Uh, we also have that.
[74:50.66]Oh, we're at the end of the chocolate here.
[74:53.24]We have Cookie Dough Bites.
[74:56.54]egg-free recipe are dough-licious dough.
[75:05.53]I can always tell how usually they have like a huge like five paragraphs of being like cookie cookie yummy yummy dough-licious, right?
[75:13.44]Like they have like a bunch of like bullshit on the back, but they don't.
[75:17.78]This contains milk, soy, and wheat.
[75:21.20]It's also packaged in a facility that has peanuts,
[75:25.42]Free nuts, milk, solids, eggs, wheat, soy.
[75:29.00]Okay, don't eat these.
[75:32.48]Apparently, don't eat these.
[75:33.42]Nobody can eat these.
[75:38.76]Ooh, look at that.
[75:41.68]That's actually pretty cool.
[75:44.67]No other candy like this came in a bag.
[75:48.87]That gets points.
[75:49.43]Milk solids.
[75:53.27]Milk solids.
[75:55.44]They get points.
[75:57.30]Don't bat-chest me.
[75:58.72]That's... Okay.
[76:00.56]This is, like... I can carry this.
[76:02.80]I don't want to, like, go... No.
[76:04.66]That gets points.
[76:07.50]Pollution?
[76:12.04]That was a weird smell.
[76:13.96]That was actually kind of off-putting.
[76:18.08]I opened that bag and somebody farted in my face.
[76:25.18]Cookie Bites.
[76:32.72]Alright, though, but yeah.
[76:33.76]I mean, come on.
[76:36.02]Yeah.
[76:38.22]Not that good, though.
[76:41.62]My initial reaction was like, Cookie Dough!
[76:43.46]I love Cookie Dough!
[76:44.38]And then it was like, ooh, no.
[76:54.01]Yeah, you want one?
[76:56.42]Honestly, like, I would just rather there not be chocolate on this.
[77:04.16]They're good, but I feel like I just want cookie dough.
[77:08.38]It is a little weird.
[77:10.32]It's actually kind of good, though.
[77:11.30]Yeah.
[77:18.40]Nice microplastics you're eating.
[77:25.69]Okay.
[77:27.31]These are not F. You know where these would actually be amazing?
[77:32.10]Part of a sundae.
[77:39.04]I'm still eating.
[77:42.80]We're good!
[77:48.01]These are... The more I'm eating, the more I like it.
[77:49.59]I picked it up and put it here.
[77:56.41]It's microplastic Andy.
[77:58.67]Microplastic Andy.
[78:00.43]It's a plastic bag!
[78:01.67]It's not microplastics in the food!
[78:09.54]These are actually pretty good.
[78:10.40]I could imagine these frozen, like it says.
[78:12.26]Try them frozen.
[78:13.98]That would be actually... Whoa, that would be... That would be way better.
[78:21.46]It's good.
[78:23.31]It was, like, when I opened the bag, it was weird.
[78:24.92]It was almost like all, like, the, like, the smelly gas in here, whatever it is.
[78:28.52]Like, it was just, like, boom, right in my face.
[78:34.40]It's definitely not, let's see.
[78:36.42]I don't, is it a C, though?
[78:38.66]What's on C right now?
[78:43.84]Whoppers are better.
[78:52.08]Are these better than a cantaloupe?
[78:54.26]I feel like that's unfair.
[78:55.30]Hey, it's like a... Hey, do you like cookie dough more than you like cantaloupe?
[79:02.39]Yeah.
[79:03.51]Oh, okay.
[79:04.03]Well, that's not fair.
[79:07.89]Cantaloupe's better.
[79:13.77]Better than Pepsi.
[79:16.00]No.
[79:17.77]Pepsi's better.
[79:19.90]These could probably go up to B in the freezer.
[79:22.68]Actually, not that bad.
[79:23.66]Actually, pretty good.
[79:26.62]The smell was a little weird.
[79:28.24]I would definitely put this in the freezer and put it on ice cream probably later tonight.
[79:35.71]I'm so sick.
[79:37.73]He's gonna get sick.
[79:39.69]The amount of candy that I'm eating...
[79:42.19]It's less than the amount of candy you ate at the last Spider-Man movie, okay?
[79:46.99]It's less than you ate at Spider-Man.
[79:50.16]I think that's all the chocolate.
[79:53.62]Hmm?
[79:54.66]There's nothing over here.
[79:56.30]There's nothing over here.
[79:59.07]Alright, now we're going to move into the gross candy.
[80:03.17]By the way, if you're just joining us and you don't know what's going on, I saw somebody said, what the fuck is this shitty tier list?
[80:08.92]I am... I've taken every item, well, 90%, of every item that I said was F. Or low D. This is all the things that I've said are F. And I have to see if I can go against my own bullshit.
[80:23.22]We're gonna see.
[80:23.94]Opinions can change.
[80:24.64]It's been a long time, and some of them have.
[80:28.20]Not for this, though.
[80:30.74]Hot tamales.
[80:33.08]I don't know why anybody eats these.
[80:34.22]And, like, the fireball whiskey.
[80:35.69]Dude, fireball whiskey!
[80:39.37]It's fucking heinous.
[80:44.91]No, Otto's not gonna get any of this.
[80:45.99]Don't worry.
[80:47.65]Don't worry.
[80:48.03]I'm being careful.
[80:51.14]This is what a hot tamale looks like?
[80:52.38]Oh, that smell.
[80:56.98]This is like a fucking Yankee candle.
[81:02.56]Yeah, this just smells like a candle from Yankee Candle.
[81:05.02]Hot tamale.
[81:05.68]That's what they are.
[81:06.20]They're kind of like Mike and Ike's, but... Hot tamale.
[81:13.52]They're actually not bad.
[81:36.00]That was kind of enjoyable.
[81:44.11]That was enjoyable.
[81:44.89]Damn, really?
[81:48.11]That was enjoyable, but I don't want another one.
[82:02.77]I don't know how people, okay, do, please in the chat tell me, like, you're not eating all these, like, are you sitting there watching TV and just eating a fucking handful of these?
[82:13.46]No way, right?
[82:17.32]How many of these are you eating?
[82:19.40]Everyone that's like, dude, hot tamales, bro, whoa, fire, like, how many are you eating?
[82:24.08]Because I feel like it's, I feel like they're just, just chew big bread.
[82:32.76]I feel like that was an enjoyable experience, but I don't want to eat handfuls of these.
[82:38.17]Maybe two at a time?
[82:45.89]These are better than the hard candy fireballs, but I still don't really like them.
[82:52.68]I'm stretching my eyes.
[82:55.78]It tastes like Big Red.
[83:00.71]Do I put these in F though?
[83:01.93]But I mean, I feel like they kind of have to stay in F because I don't, I'm not going to eat anymore.
[83:05.28]Yeah, what's in F?
[83:10.78]Yeah.
[83:13.00]Tootsie Rolls, Honeydew.
[83:23.51]Fucking Diet Mountain Dew.
[83:30.12]Would I rather... But I mean, I don't want to eat this, though.
[83:33.24]That was a fine experience, but... You catching this?
[83:43.93]You catching this?
[83:46.27]Still trying it.
[83:57.66]Okay, it's better than Red Delicious Apple.
[84:01.84]It is?
[84:02.12]I didn't say F. They're D. They're better than Red Delicious Apple, though.
[84:20.45]Are they?
[84:20.83]I don't know.
[84:21.57]It's hard.
[84:23.81]Because I would eat a Red Delicious Apple.
[84:25.60]If you were like, here, this is a Red Delicious Apple.
[84:29.10]Eat this Red Delicious Apple.
[84:30.46]I'd be like, okay.
[84:31.62]I don't love it, but I wouldn't eat more than two of these.
[84:38.20]Yeah, they're D. They just don't do it for me.
[84:45.05]Yeah, that's fair.
[84:47.27]That's fair.
[84:47.87]I don't... Not a fan.
[84:49.45]They are better than the balls, though.
[84:50.63]Like, the fire balls.
[84:52.43]They're better than those.
[84:53.61]Because, you know what?
[84:55.63]It's one and done.
[84:58.18]Like, this kind of is like a breath mint to me.

[87:34.25]Don't.
[87:34.43]Please.
[87:34.97]Really?
[87:38.03]Are you trying to tell me that when you buy this little bag of Swedish fish, you're going to eat five fish with a recommended doctor thing on the back and then... That's enough.
[87:51.00]What are you talking about?
[87:51.78]Like, you're going to sit there and eat until you don't want it anymore.
[87:56.92]Who does that?
[87:58.89]Oh, oh, hot tamales.
[88:00.58]Oh, yeah, dude.

[88:05.76]16 pieces.
[88:08.68]I wouldn't want five of these.
[88:09.90]16, that's a lot.
[88:15.03]Yeah, guess what?
[88:16.63]Do you know how many cookies a serving of Oreos is?
[88:19.79]Don't look.
[88:20.29]Guess.
[88:21.79]What is a serving of Oreos?
[88:23.44]Guess.
[88:25.80]Guess.
[88:28.44]Don't look it up.
[88:32.46]Okay, yeah, like two or three, two or three.
[88:36.71]Alright, all these Andys in here.
[88:38.39]I'm not even gonna give you a nickname.
[88:40.01]I'm just gonna call you Andy.
[88:41.11]All these Andys in here that pretend like they don't go to the Oreo sleeve and get as many as they can fit holding like this comfortably with the glass of milk.
[88:53.32]Please.
[88:54.38]Oh, I'm going to take two cookies.
[88:55.96]Nope.
[88:56.40]You are... Excuse me.
[88:58.02]You are going to fit as many as you can.
[88:59.58]Oh, that was gross.
[89:01.43]I just spit a little bit out.
[89:04.59]No.
[89:06.91]She thought I was puking.
[89:08.89]No, I'm just talking and being rude and like not finishing the food in my mouth.
[89:13.97]You go like this.
[89:14.61]It's like one, two, three, four, five.
[89:17.69]Five.
[89:18.87]And then you eat.
[89:19.85]Nobody eats two.
[89:27.30]I never eat two Oreos.
[89:31.01]Ever.
[89:32.07]I usually eat like between three and five.
[89:49.11]F. Didn't change my mind.
[89:55.88]Those are better than Tootsie Rolls.
[90:00.11]What's, what's, okay, what is above F and low D?
[90:09.91]Red Delicious Apple is the barrier to get to D. Okay.
[90:25.94]I'd rather eat a red delicious apple than a Swedish fish.
[90:30.00]People hate me, that's fine.
[90:33.40]I'd rather eat a red delicious apple as a candy.
[90:40.87]But aren't these... I would rather have the Haribo gummy bears.
[90:46.29]There is a red Haribo gummy bear that's better than this.
[90:53.54]Right?
[90:55.46]Look, I'm not telling you that how you need to feel.
[90:57.86]I'm not saying, hey, dude, I don't like Swedish fish, so fuck you.
[91:01.73]Don't clip that.
[91:03.45]One minute, one minute, one minute, one minute, one minute, one minute, one minute, one minute, one minute.
[91:08.11]I never said that.
[91:09.65]All I'm saying is that I find them to be off-putting.
[91:12.88]I just don't really like them.
[91:13.90]I couldn't eat more than one or two of those.
[91:16.78]Alright, let's keep going.
[91:22.21]Oh, right.
[91:22.97]This is okay.
[91:23.85]This is gonna suck.
[91:26.65]This is the bean boozled game.
[91:31.01]I think I can just pick them out.
[91:32.03]It should be easy.
[91:34.16]I said that, okay, I said popcorn jelly beans were dog shit, and everyone freaked out.
[91:40.88]You cannot just buy, and in one day, in one, remember, this is like literally two days ago we talked about doing this.
[91:47.44]I couldn't just buy popcorn... I couldn't buy popcorn-flavored jelly beans anywhere.
[91:53.23]So, the popcorn-flavored jelly beans are in here, but half of them are rotten egg.
[91:58.65]This might be a little tricky.
[92:03.88]There's one right here.
[92:10.62]Is there a way to tell?
[92:11.48]Like, can I smell it?
[92:16.21]I don't know.
[92:17.75]It's either going to be rotten egg or buttered popcorn.
[92:19.83]I couldn't get them anywhere.
[92:22.56]Somebody said, what's the difference?
[92:24.64]I want that person to be very important for a minute.
[92:31.96]Cut into it and smell it.
[92:33.04]Okay.
[92:35.94]I think I can do with this.
[92:48.99]Huh?
[92:51.59]Somebody said they had the dog food one and it stayed in their mouth for days.
[92:56.62]This is buttered popcorn.
[92:58.46]I got it.
[92:58.82]Okay.
[93:00.92]Oh, it smells like buttered popcorn.
[93:03.12]Why?
[93:03.52]This shit was made in a goddamn laboratory.
[93:06.18]Buttered popcorn.
[93:06.80]This is accurate.
[93:07.60]Here we go.
[93:09.50]Is it?
[93:09.76]Or is this a rotten egg?
[93:12.42]I don't know.
[93:17.67]I hope, I think it's buttered popcorn.
[93:22.59]Is it a rotten egg?
[93:23.15]I don't know.
[93:28.09]I can't, I can't tell.
[93:28.87]I actually, I can't tell.
[93:33.19]No, you're good.
[93:34.45]I don't know.
[93:35.86]I don't know.
[93:36.34]I don't know.
[93:39.58]No, I think this is rotten egg.
[93:40.74]No, it's a buttered popcorn.
[93:45.42]Who eats this shit?
[93:46.86]Oh my god, this is... No.
[93:56.17]I need to know if that was rotten egg.
[93:58.05]I kind of like... What I know?
[94:01.43]My brain is telling me...
[94:09.55]Polly's right here and she's like, maybe you should cut it first and don't eat it right away.
[94:13.00]Why?
[94:13.20]Yeah, because like I'm going to have like rotten egg breath.
[94:17.08]I would know.
[94:17.48]Somebody said just eat a handful.
[94:25.60]That'd be so fucked up.
[94:28.38]You'd probably have like a fucking like mental breakdown.
[94:33.75]It's not designed for that.
[94:35.17]Eat a handful.
[94:42.14]I'm curious.
[94:42.72]I'm curious.
[94:43.08]Let's go.
[94:55.47]It tastes like hamburger meat.
[94:57.23]It tastes like hamburger meat.
[94:58.27]It tastes like raw hamburger meat.
[95:51.37]Otto filled in.
[95:52.91]What did you, what did you do?
[95:55.13]Otto ate a cookie.
[95:57.63]Okay, buttered popcorn is F. That honestly tastes like, it tastes like raw hamburger meat.
[96:04.14]I have no, what was the, what was the possibilities?
[96:06.02]Because I know I had like a... It was a, it was like two blues, a pink...
[96:18.83]Oh, what the fuck?
[96:19.99]What's wrong with these people?
[96:21.30]Why would you make that?
[96:22.14]Now I know what it is.
[96:25.42]Band-Aid, an old band-aid with blood on it.
[96:29.26]Oh, okay.
[96:31.97]No, I'm okay.
[96:33.93]So that was...
[96:36.48]barf, pomegranate, old bandaid, rotten egg, liver and onions, toothpaste and berry.
[96:47.45]It just literally tastes like raw hamburger meat.
[96:49.01]Okay.
[96:56.19]I'm okay.
[96:58.97]No, it's all gone.
[97:04.89]We'll do a palate cleanse.
[97:08.87]I don't know why people do this.
[97:11.33]I know it's like content to do this.
[97:13.78]And I'm not just talking about like streams or YouTube.
[97:16.04]This is like friend content where everyone goes like, well, what is it?
[97:19.26]And it's like, and everyone like runs away and shit.
[97:22.02]But like, no, fucking just read a book.
[97:24.96]Go fucking LARP somewhere.
[97:26.15]You know what I mean?
[97:26.71]Go like LARPing.
[97:28.77]Don't do this.
[97:29.83]Go play like fucking N64.
[97:33.61]Alright.
[97:33.83]Well, the bottom popcorn's F. And I think it might be really low.
[97:38.65]What is in F right now?
[97:43.67]Okay, Swedish fish are way better than buttered popcorn.
[97:47.28]I know I hate them.
[97:48.68]My opinion does not change.
[97:49.62]But, I mean, this would be like fun friend content, baby.
[97:54.80]Worse than Tootsie Roll?
[98:00.04]That's way worse than a honeydew melon.
[98:02.82]In fact, you know what?
[98:03.48]I think honeydew... I mean, this is like a bunch of other candy shit.
[98:08.56]But I mean, of course I would rather eat a honeydew melon than eat a buttered popcorn.
[98:17.33]Don't say it's worse than milk does.
[98:18.49]Wait, what did this person say?
[98:22.17]He said, look man, if your perception of the candy is already at F-tier, I don't think a half-assed taste test is going to change the scoring wildly.
[98:29.50]Tell that to Whoppers.
[98:31.62]Tell that to Red Delicious Apple.
[98:32.96]Tell that to Baby Ruth.
[98:34.62]Some of these have changed dramatically.
[98:35.86]Some of these have actually changed dramatically.
[98:41.37]Whopper was at F, and I put it all the way up to like C and B. Would you rather eat a honeydew melon or a bloody bandaid?
[98:55.35]Well, you know, I'm not so sure.
[98:59.69]Alright, here we go.
[99:00.55]A lot of people have been waiting for Fun Dip.
[99:01.83]Okay, Fun Dip.
[99:11.61]I put FunDip at F or D because... It's been a long time.
[99:19.19]It's been a long time.
[99:19.97]I just remember being like... And this is the sour kind, so... FunDip is S. And that's why I'm doing this.
[99:32.02]That's all that was available at Walmart.

[102:04.01]It is good.
[102:05.95]It's not too sour either.
[102:06.99]I thought it was going to be like, ooh, Warheads.
[102:08.87]This is fantastic.
[102:15.05]And they give you three flavors.
[102:16.33]I'm actually excited.
[102:18.11]Alright, I was wrong.
[102:19.95]I was wrong.
[102:22.18]You know what it is?
[102:22.60]It's because it was like, oh, like kids eat this.
[102:24.48]You know what I mean?
[102:24.92]Like, oh, Fun Dip for kids.
[102:26.10]I'm like, why would I buy this?
[102:27.17]It's a strawberry one.
[102:34.13]I don't fucking need to open the rest of it.
[102:38.55]Fun Dip Executive.
[102:40.69]Okay.
[102:41.03]Alright.
[102:42.29]I think I got a taste for that.
[102:43.47]And they give you two sticks.
[102:44.64]The value here is actually phenomenal.
[102:49.97]I'm actually kind of sad I'm not going to be able to eat this all.
[102:52.03]Wait, hold on.
[102:52.51]Let's check.
[102:52.99]The mystery flavor could... Wait, the mystery flavor could be barf.
[102:56.49]We don't know.
[102:58.29]There could be rotten egg.
[103:05.22]That's incredibly enjoyable.
[103:06.72]I wish I was fucking making this up.
[103:08.30]I don't... I really don't want to like this.
[103:10.56]Is this watermelon?
[103:18.48]I mean, it's just phenomenal.
[103:22.89]It's a perfect amount of sweetness.
[103:24.71]It's a perfect amount of sugar.
[103:26.21]I always thought this was just an absolute sugar bomb.
[103:31.03]This tastes light.
[103:32.19]This tastes light to me.
[103:39.04]Fuck, I thought I hated these.
[103:40.32]I really thought I hated this.
[103:41.38]It's light.
[103:42.88]It's light.
[103:46.54]It is just sugar.
[103:47.52]Mix them together.
[103:48.14]We're not doing that yet.
[103:51.38]Throw a bandaid in here.
[103:52.66]Imagine like, I don't know.
[103:56.57]I need to know what it tastes like with a bandaid.
[103:59.25]Okay, good.
[104:00.23]What about the mystery?
[104:02.75]Fuck, I would want to just eat these.
[104:03.95]Be careful with these.
[104:04.61]Okay.
[104:09.40]Okay.
[104:16.58]I haven't dropped anything.
[104:17.28]He's good.
[104:18.23]Okay, this is blue.
[104:22.47]This is blue.
[104:34.99]That's the best one yet.
[104:37.89]That's the best one yet.
[104:43.05]What?
[104:45.54]What did they say?
[104:49.12]Pregnancy test?
[105:04.56]I can't even eat it now.
[105:06.24]Oh, why'd you do that?
[105:07.44]This was S. This was S. I was gonna put it in S. And now I'm like, there's a pregnancy test in my mouth.
[105:14.69]What the fuck?
[105:17.35]Okay, hold on.
[105:18.87]No, don't do that either.
[105:20.34]Don't do that either.
[105:20.98]Okay, very important.
[105:31.04]I feel like I'm going like frost-eyed right here.
[105:34.51]Okay, very important.
[105:36.53]This is, oh, you've ruined it.
[105:40.59]You've ruined it.
[105:41.31]It was gonna be like A+.

[106:20.44]I'm trying to think of other things you piss on.
[106:22.19]Because when you pee, I'm thinking of pee.
[106:26.03]Yeah, but like pregnancy tests, like, okay, what else is a test?
[106:30.05]Okay, it's just candy.
[106:31.77]It's candy, it's candy, it's candy, it's candy, it's candy.
[106:35.57]Why did I say that?
[106:36.35]I don't know, because you said pregnancy test.
[106:39.03]You said that.
[106:40.23]I was sitting here enjoying the mystery flavor of Sunny Delight.
[106:44.29]That's not what this is.
[106:46.23]The mystery flavor of Fun Dim.
[106:48.81]And I hear pregnancy test.
[106:51.51]And I'm like, okay, well, gross.
[106:52.67]Well, let me one up you here then.

[107:14.88]You don't pee on a COVID test.
[107:21.49]Alright, let's bite the stick and see how it feels.
[107:38.13]Tastes like marshmallows.
[107:41.17]Good.
[107:42.19]I was wrong.
[107:43.13]I apologize profusely.
[107:44.29]I would keep eating this.
[107:44.97]I would.
[107:46.61]In fact, I might actually seal this up.
[107:49.91]That's S. I was wrong.
[107:51.57]I put it in F and it was wrong.
[107:53.99]I was completely and totally incorrect.
[107:58.60]Fun dip is S tier.
[108:00.44]I'm sorry.
[108:00.88]I apologize.
[108:01.42]Should I just get it out of the way?

[108:44.57]Uh, lower left of the OBS window.
[108:49.47]Should be like in the very, very lower left, like the bottom, like the task manager.
[108:52.86]Is it not there?
[108:55.76]Hour and 49.
[108:57.38]Alright, let's go.
[108:58.98]I have 30K viewers right now.
[109:01.88]What are you doing here?
[109:02.64]Alright, these are original.
[109:05.18]I know that, like, dude, get the tropical ones.
[109:06.78]Get the other ones.
[109:08.82]This is original.
[109:09.98]Mike and Ike, original fruits.
[109:12.00]Original fruit flavors.
[109:17.65]These are the originals.
[109:21.53]Waiting for trolly?
[109:22.31]Yeah, make sure to hit that bell.
[109:24.93]Alright, which one do I eat first?
[109:29.28]People were pissed that I didn't like these.
[109:30.74]Remember, it was like, dude, you have to eat the jelly, please.
[109:36.56]There's a lot of reds in here.
[109:44.26]Red?
[109:44.50]Okay, I'm going for red.
[109:47.66]Red.
[109:51.16]Red.
[110:13.35]No.
[110:15.37]No, it kind of tastes like medicine.
[110:18.45]No.
[110:20.21]No.
[110:24.22]No.
[110:27.88]You have to... It's only fair if you try each one.
[110:29.60]Yeah, that was bad.
[110:32.82]It tastes kind of like... It kind of tastes like medicine.
[110:37.78]Eat the green one?
[110:40.15]Well, hold on.
[110:40.51]I'm alright.
[110:42.37]Got orange here.
[110:43.33]I'm doing fine.
[110:47.82]You're going to have diarrhea.
[110:50.64]So what?
[110:55.34]Do orange?
[111:01.86]Way better than red.
[111:07.35]Way better.
[111:09.09]That was actually very good.
[111:13.55]I have to be fair, though.
[111:14.43]I'm going to rate these individually and then average the score.
[111:18.45]Red, F. Orange, B. Orange was a B. We have F, we have B. It's yellow.
[111:35.01]A. A.
[111:39.64]We've got an F, we have a B, we have an A. Yellow is A. I love that, like, tart lemon flavor.
[111:46.22]Oh, hell yeah.
[111:49.40]Okay, we only got two more.
[111:50.30]We've got... What are they?
[111:57.35]Oh, red is cherry.
[111:58.59]I thought it was going to be strawberry.
[112:00.11]Okay, so that might have fucked up my brain.
[112:02.17]This is strawberry.
[112:03.87]I thought red was strawberry.
[112:08.96]Alright, let's see what strawberry.
[112:10.00]That was A, B, F. What about this one?
[112:14.18]What does this taste like?
[112:25.01]It's not good.
[112:28.57]What?
[112:28.77]It's a very specific strawberry, like fake flavor, and it's not good.
[112:39.18]Not good.
[112:47.97]It's bad.
[112:49.27]That was the worst one.
[112:50.75]F. Green.
[112:52.87]Green.
[112:53.11]You're gonna have to save it here.
[112:59.49]Green.
[113:01.19]For Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[113:04.99]He eventually gave his lightsaber to Luke.
[113:07.23]Luke had a blue lightsaber.
[113:13.31]You fucking lost me.
[113:37.67]You lost me.
[113:38.99]I thought that was going to be sour apple.
[113:40.83]I was waiting for green apple, and I got lime.
[113:43.29]You fucked with me.
[113:53.98]I was waiting for like a sour, tart, green apple, like Jolly Rancher flavor.
[114:02.99]Lime.
[114:05.49]Hold on.
[114:12.41]I'm not going to eat them all at once.
[114:23.98]Oh, no.
[114:24.66]I don't like it.
[114:42.70]Actually, it's alright.
[114:45.24]C. Oh, that's actually kind of good.
[114:48.62]B. Alright, what do we got?
[114:53.77]A, B, B, A, B, B, F, F. What's that average to?
[114:56.65]Is that a C?
[115:01.57]A, B, B, F, F. Did he already do the bean boozle?
[115:06.42]Yeah, dude, rewind.
[115:07.14]I puked all over the place.
[115:08.04]We had to redo the whole thing.
[115:11.89]So, that's a C?
[115:14.83]Yeah, they're alright.
[115:16.71]I was probably unfair.
[115:23.00]I'll be really honest, I'd rather eat this than any of those.
[115:28.24]Like, Whoppers were good.
[115:30.28]But, like, I feel like... No, maybe below Whopper.
[115:34.55]I was unfair.
[115:37.29]You know, I said they were boring.
[115:39.29]And they actually are not boring.
[115:42.10]It was like a burst of flavor.
[115:43.46]I don't know if I had my brain.
[115:45.42]The flavor profile of these was way more diluted than that what just was.
[115:48.72]Did they change the recipe?
[115:53.65]Because that was good.
[115:54.57]Some of those were really, really good.
[115:55.55]The lemon one, perfect.
[115:58.51]Orange was nearly good.
[116:01.21]Yeah, that was good.
[116:01.73]That was fine.
[116:02.77]I would eat the rest of these.
[116:03.66]I will.
[116:05.74]Let's put it in the storage unit over here.
[116:08.40]Alright.
[116:08.80]We're getting there.
[116:15.53]Here comes dots.
[116:17.29]I don't want to do a handful.
[116:19.53]I'm trying to just do like one or two at a time.
[116:25.63]They taste like colors.
[116:26.77]Yeah.
[116:28.55]Dots, everyone says F. Everybody does, but I have to be fair.
[116:36.01]What happened?
[116:38.03]What happened?
[116:39.97]Tootsie makes these.
[116:40.99]What happened?
[116:42.86]What else does Tootsie make?
[116:45.44]Man, I just don't think I like anything from the Tootsie Roll company, do I?
[116:50.23]Do I like anything from Tootsie Roll?
[116:54.89]I love dots.
[116:58.43]I have not eaten these in 10 fucking years.
[117:02.30]Let's find out.
[117:02.86]Probably should cut it.
[117:08.86]Tootsie Pops, yeah, but I know Tootsie Pops are good.
[117:13.08]I feel like Tootsie needs more to be good than just be a Tootsie.
[117:15.94]Alright, here we go.
[117:19.37]Dots.
[117:21.41]Assorted fruit flavored gumdrops.
[117:28.53]Okay.
[117:31.41]Give it a try.
[117:33.03]This is old people?
[117:34.95]Um, I don't think so.
[117:37.09]I don't know very many old people that would eat these.
[117:38.65]Alright, let's give it a try.
[117:42.77]What do I get first?
[117:43.41]This is pink, it looks like.
[117:47.52]Oh, no.
[117:55.04]It just smells like, it smells like plastic.
[117:57.97]Like, it doesn't smell like candy.
[118:12.96]This is apocalypse food.
[118:17.35]Like, this is like currency.
[118:19.21]Like, in like a thousand years when the apocalypse happens.
[118:21.93]This is like, this is apocalypse food.
[118:36.97]God.
[118:43.93]The thing is, this is apocalypse food, right?
[118:46.17]But I feel like these will last, like, a hundred years.
[118:58.92]I mean, it is what it is.
[119:00.94]It is what it is.
[119:02.28]You know what you're getting.
[119:03.60]You know what it is.
[119:05.18]It's just like a slimy, like, waxy F-tier candy.
[119:14.00]This is lasting a very long time, though.
[119:15.44]I could just sit here like this.
[119:17.02]And it's okay.
[119:17.32]That's what I'm saying.
[119:22.56]This is apocalypse food.
[119:23.78]Like, you could suck on a dot.
[119:25.94]Like, while you're, like, going out and looking for supplies and shooting at the zombies and shit.
[119:30.44]Like, this will last, like, the four hours.
[119:33.36]Like, you could sit here like this.
[119:35.97]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[119:36.73]You know what I mean?
[119:37.31]Like.
[119:43.13]Everybody, like, hates these, right?
[119:44.39]Everybody talks shit about these, but, I mean... These, the only purpose for these is to put on the top of gingerbread houses.
[119:57.41]And then you go, like... And then eat, like, the frosting.
[120:02.73]I mean, it's just a, it's just like a gumdrop.
[120:06.19]everything have to be flashy with like sour fun dip with like three flavors and one of them is a mystery loot box I mean it's just it's just candy it's just like regular ass candy and you can just suck I mean he's talking for they last a long time I think it's okay I mean I'm gonna put them in f because I think they belong there but I mean I don't I don't
[120:32.42]This is like an American staple.
[120:34.20]You know what I mean?
[120:35.33]Apple pie.
[120:37.33]McDonald's.
[120:38.37]Dots.
[120:40.05]It's like American old candy.
[120:42.41]It's a D. It's D. Who sucks on dots?
[121:03.96]Whoa!
[121:05.92]Whoa, hold on.
[121:08.60]Yeah!
[121:08.70]You're supposed to chew them?
[121:16.86]I like my way way better.
[121:18.72]You're supposed to chew them?
[121:24.57]Oh, hold on.
[121:26.01]What?
[121:27.85]Hey.
[121:28.03]Hey, hold on.
[121:29.37]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[121:39.15]No, I Mean it's just these These are the same except this one texturally is better and I think the flavors are better They're the same exact candy to me.
[121:56.42]They're like that.
[121:56.86]This one's just better.
[121:57.54]I
[122:04.44]I mean, maybe if you don't like the kind of hard outside, this is just a soft outside version of Mike and Ike's.
[122:10.30]I have the D for me.
[122:11.18]The D minus.
[122:13.31]I'm not spending any more time on dots.
[122:15.11]They're better than Hot Tamales.
[122:19.25]Whoa, wait a minute.
[122:20.23]Yeah, they're better than Hot Tamales.
[122:21.29]Are they?
[122:21.55]No, they're not.
[122:23.47]What's in front of that?
[122:29.48]Yeah, they're worse than Almond Joy, but they're okay.
[122:36.24]Alright.
[122:39.54]Everybody's waiting.
[122:41.88]Everybody's waiting to see what the streamer has to say about Trolley.
[122:44.98]Mmm.
[122:47.44]Trolley.
[122:50.20]Yeah, the Swizzlers too, but those are F. Trolley.
[123:03.14]I've never had these.
[123:04.10]I just assumed they were F because I don't like gummy worms because gummy worms are for children.
[123:09.43]Fuck it.
[123:09.67]Let's go.
[123:10.23]I'm doing it right now.
[123:15.71]I got a lot of shit the other day for saying that I would put these in F or D. I'm ready.
[123:21.75]Let's go.
[123:22.03]I almost dropped it.
[123:23.95]Here we go.
[123:26.35]Moment of truth for Trolli.
[123:37.28]I didn't mean to.
[123:45.44]They don't smell good.
[123:48.49]They smell very... fake.
[123:54.15]Alright, I was told to eat the pink and blue one first.
[123:59.95]Here it is.
[124:01.45]Here we go.
[124:01.79]Let me cleanse the palette.
[124:10.35]Okay.
[124:14.88]Here we go.
[124:50.20]They're good.
[124:52.62]They're good, but they're not S. Don't say that.
[125:02.66]Green.
[125:05.26]Green and orange coming up.
[125:08.96]I thought these were going to be way more sour, like a Sour Patch Kid.
[125:12.24]That part is fantastic.
[125:17.05]Once all the sand comes off, though.
[125:21.10]I don't know.
[125:21.56]They've become a weird... I don't know.
[125:37.70]That was an A. That was an A-.
[125:41.66]That one.
[125:42.90]If that's the best, if that's what you're telling me is the best trolley, I'm not too excited about the rest.
[126:00.68]Hmm.
[126:02.30]That one's alright.
[126:10.63]The orange part, I don't really like that much.
[126:12.05]The green part is good.
[126:14.64]Stop chewing them.
[126:15.34]Stop chewing.
[126:15.76]Don't chew them.
[126:16.36]I thought I was supposed to chew them.
[126:19.20]I'm not supposed to swallow them.
[126:21.84]You want me just to like, like a, what am I, a bird?
[126:23.98]Am I a fucking baby bird?
[126:26.13]Do I look like, do I got a beak?
[126:27.57]Do I have a beak?
[126:32.59]okay that was alright that was a beef you know but hold on here's the thing I thought these were huge the reason why I didn't ever buy these is because I thought they were like these like gross like like like six seven inch long things I didn't think they were this little
[127:01.08]I thought they were going to be these curly Q. Like, bleh.
[127:05.52]I didn't know they were little.
[127:09.38]Why are you chewing for so long?
[127:10.96]I'm just chewing the food!
[127:12.12]Why would I think that?
[127:17.08]Gummy worms are long, aren't they?
[127:19.73]Red-yellow is not good.
[127:21.07]Okay, well, trolley's the best.
[127:22.97]Get trolley.
[127:24.21]Except only eat one of the colors in there.
[127:27.51]Not the other, like, 35%.
[127:34.41]Okay.
[127:34.79]Okay, after I do the candy, we'll probably clean up a little bit.
[127:39.45]So after I do these next two candies, we're going to clean up.
[127:42.19]We're going to move some of the stuff to the fridge.
[127:44.25]We'll do our chips.
[127:46.55]I'm very excited about this.
[127:47.62]I'm going to piss a lot of you off.
[127:49.52]Alright, here we go.
[127:54.98]That was bad.
[127:55.40]Yeah, that was way too harsh.
[128:02.10]It was, like, way too acidic in the first second.
[128:07.76]No, I don't... They're good.
[128:10.64]That first one was fantastic.
[128:13.36]Trolley?
[128:13.80]Nice try.
[128:17.06]Nice try.
[128:19.09]That's a B. Everybody thought it... No, that's not an S.
[128:32.73]Alright, the part on the outside.
[128:33.97]Okay, if this was a stick.
[128:36.60]If this was a stick and I could suck it and it was a stick, I would like it.
[128:43.74]Why are these even here?
[128:45.02]Why do I even have these?
[128:47.49]Apple Jacks.
[128:48.21]Like, I'm going to eat a bowl of cereal right now?
[128:51.37]No, I'll eat these for breakfast fucking someday.
[128:54.61]Apple Jacks have fucking C. I don't even need to eat them.
[128:58.89]Oh, we got, like, bread, too.
[129:00.07]Alright, okay.
[129:01.81]What is, um... Oh.
[129:07.50]Orange slices.
[129:09.54]It's cafeteria food?
[129:10.82]It's like cafeteria.
[129:17.26]I didn't want to buy a box of Apple Jacks, though, man.
[129:19.79]Like, I'm not gonna buy a whole box.
[129:25.60]These are the orange slices.
[129:28.22]Do I even really need to eat one of these?
[129:29.48]I feel like I'm going to fucking hate it.
[129:35.86]Find out.
[129:43.27]Orange slices are really good.
[129:45.03]Yeah, I know, it's the warmest time of the candy.
[129:46.47]Alright, orange slices.
[129:55.72]Oh, these are awful looking.
[129:58.50]They're hard.
[129:59.14]They've got a stiffness to them that I cannot describe on camera.
[130:07.35]It's Walmart brand.
[130:08.97]Does the brand really matter?
[130:10.47]Does the brand matter for these?
[130:12.65]They all were made in like 1950.
[130:18.85]Orange slices.
[130:19.59]Here we go.
[130:24.96]Oh, this smells like a Christmas decoration.
[130:52.39]Who's going to buy this as a gas station?
[130:57.21]It turns into this.
[131:01.01]What was it?
[131:03.31]The brand matters.
[131:05.66]It's great.
[131:06.20]What's wrong with great value brand.
[131:15.02]This is an aftertaste here.
[131:16.96]That is very bad.
[131:25.51]It's a very bad aftertaste.
[131:30.41]I look sick?
[131:31.05]I'm just sitting here like... They kind of look like slugs.
[131:41.74]Doesn't the packaging look like fucking slugs?
[131:44.08]Like larva.
[131:46.65]Alright, the initial bite was fine.
[131:49.43]After that, though... No, these are F. I don't need to take another bite.
[131:55.53]But like, what do I... I could decorate a fucking cake with these or something.
[132:01.02]That's low F. What do we have for low F?
[132:03.14]I think these are at the very bottom.
[132:17.88]These are below milk duds.
[132:19.10]These are fucking awful.
[132:21.81]Those are very bad.
[132:23.23]Does it really matter?
[132:25.83]Does a brand actually matter?
[132:33.54]Are you going to clean up?
[132:34.22]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[132:35.16]There's only one more candy.
[132:37.38]And it's Twizzlers.
[132:40.75]I'll take one quick bite.
[132:43.51]I know you like these, right?
[132:48.73]I'm going to try a little bit because I have to do it.
[132:51.61]I can't.
[132:51.89]Those were very bad.
[132:54.65]These smell bad, too.
[132:58.80]Yes, they do.
[133:00.82]They smell like a like a new coat.
[133:04.76]Like, it smells like new shoes.
[133:06.89]Why?
[133:07.71]Why does it smell like a new pair of sneakers?
[133:11.03]Like a new shoes, like new coat.
[133:13.55]Like, what the fuck?
[133:17.01]It smells like new clothing.
[133:24.50]This smells like new clothes.
[133:32.90]I'm just saying, it smells like new clothing.
[133:46.67]New car, yeah.
[133:53.58]No, F. Oh my god, no.
[133:55.00]They're just bad.
[133:55.68]They just don't taste good.
[134:04.51]Okay, they're better than the orange slices.
[134:08.43]The only thing to do with Twizzlers is this.
[134:18.50]Haha.
[134:22.32]It's a bump.
[134:23.32]They're F. The peelable Twizzlers are better.
[134:27.76]Way better.
[134:30.90]No, I don't... Yeah, they're F. I knew my mind wasn't going to change on those at all.
[134:36.65]Drink the soda?
[134:39.39]Yeah.
[134:41.93]I'm not going to ruin a perfectly good Coke.
[134:43.55]Why would I?
[134:44.40]Is that what people are actually saying to do that?
[134:49.80]Wait, this is a real thing?
[134:53.96]What?
[134:55.42]You drink soda out of a Twizzler.
[134:57.42]Who does this?
[134:59.68]You're saying it has to be a Coke, right?
[135:00.77]Yeah, it's normally Coke, but it's normally red wine.
[135:08.55]Never doing that again.
[135:12.71]Never doing that ever again.
[135:20.55]No, I'm not doing that ever again.
[135:23.09]Alright.
[135:24.63]There you go.
[135:25.01]There's your candy.
[135:26.61]I want to clean up a little bit.
[135:28.55]We still have... There's still a decent amount.
[135:31.70]There's like six or seven more things to do.
[135:34.96]We have the chips.
[135:36.85]Which I'm only going to eat like one chip, so we'll be fine.
[135:40.26]I'm going to go pee.
[135:40.88]I'm going to go piss out all this like sugar that I just ate.
[135:44.88]Uh, yeah, we'll go.
[135:45.44]I'm going to burp.
[135:49.12]We're good.
[135:50.34]Alright, we'll go BRB.
[135:51.42]I'll be right back.
[135:51.82]We're going to do chips, clean up a little, and we'll keep going.
[135:54.18]Be right back.
[138:16.29]Bye.
[142:20.70]Okay, hello.
[142:23.90]I am back.
[142:27.11]He's dead.
[142:31.19]So, all the sugary stuff is gone.
[142:33.09]Although, I'm... I'm not... I said that Frank's Red Hog was bad.
[142:43.96]Oh, I got a little spoon here.
[142:44.96]Okay, well, whatever.
[142:45.72]Alright, so here's how it's gonna work.
[142:47.64]No, it's fine.
[142:49.92]Oh, there's a plate.
[142:50.42]Okay.
[142:55.35]I'm going to do this last because it'll ruin my palate.
[142:58.41]Chug it.
[143:01.44]He thinks these chips don't have sugar.
[143:04.04]Again, if you're joining us and you don't know what's going on.
[143:06.68]People have been joining going, what is he doing?
[143:08.26]This is fucking stupid.
[143:08.94]This guy sucks.
[143:09.93]Just listen.
[143:11.13]So over the years, I've made tier lists of food, candies, snacks, sodas, and I got everything that I said was F.
[143:20.69]Because I am being an asshole and I'm being biased.
[143:23.86]And I'm going to just face my own bullshit.
[143:26.26]Do I actually think sourdough is F?
[143:29.66]I don't eat this.
[143:31.24]And we've seen a few turnarounds.
[143:32.50]We've seen a couple of major turnarounds.
[143:35.48]So let's go.
[143:37.50]Let's go with this.
[143:40.37]Here you go.
[143:41.19]Here you go, internet.
[143:42.15]Here you go.
[143:43.19]Talkies, internet.
[143:44.17]Can't wait.
[143:46.20]Takis, oh dude, I love Takis.
[143:47.88]Takis crusted fucking mozzarella sticks.
[143:50.22]Taki mac and cheese.
[143:51.74]Oh dude, imagine if you ate a Taki and put a macaroni and cheese on it.
[143:54.70]Here you go, internet, here you go.
[143:55.92]Let's go.
[144:02.17]Takis, I... Trader Joe's makes a version of this that is way better.
[144:14.01]And look, I just picked up one.
[144:16.81]Gotta put it down.
[144:18.65]I can't go back to work.
[144:20.49]I have to wash my hands.
[144:21.91]I ate one.
[144:22.83]I put one in my mouth.
[144:27.63]Yeah, I know it.
[144:31.49]You know what it is?
[144:33.47]Takis?
[144:35.65]Let's have one more.
[144:40.88]I would like these more.
[144:43.57]I can taste the MSG.
[144:46.91]MSG has a very specific flavor.
[144:49.73]It's on Doritos.
[144:51.27]It's that Dorito, umami MSG flavor.
[144:57.42]I can taste the MSG.
[145:00.14]I know what it tastes like.
[145:04.78]It's that very deep, almost like Dorito-like flavor.
[145:11.81]Um, that'll be alright.
[145:16.45]Do they taste good?
[145:17.39]I mean, they're... I got the stupid-ass blue ones, too.
[145:24.07]Um... You're out of your fucking mind?
[145:29.74]MSG is tasty.
[145:31.24]MSG has that very, like, that salty kind of deep, like, flavor taste.
[145:37.84]Use chopsticks.
[145:39.34]I don't... Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[145:42.13]Let me be... I gotta be fair.
[145:42.85]Alright.
[145:45.20]These are extreme, by the way.
[145:46.40]Be careful.
[145:46.76]These are extreme.
[145:47.58]No, it's a fucking potato chip.
[145:50.19]Relax.
[145:51.93]Or corn.
[146:00.42]I don't... I put them in F because, you know what?
[146:02.52]I'm a contrarian dick.
[146:04.82]And when everybody on the internet loves something, I go, well, you see, I'd rather have to buy some Trader Joe's.
[146:11.11]They're...
[146:18.31]They're a... See?
[146:24.01]How am I going to shake your hand?
[146:25.15]What the fuck?
[146:28.61]They're a high C. They're a C. They're okay.
[146:32.18]It's just like MSG.
[146:33.40]I can taste it.
[146:36.66]I would put them definitely above Red Delicious Apple.
[146:45.23]What?
[146:45.37]You don't want me to do like the thing where I go like...
[146:50.73]Worst hand 2022?
[146:51.71]What?
[146:51.97]What the fuck are you talking about?
[146:55.12]That's not even a category.
[146:56.98]Did you drink all this?
[146:58.52]Did you drink that?
[147:00.84]Chat, I know you did.
[147:02.06]Alright, so this is all.
[147:02.94]Now I've got talkie fingers.
[147:04.33]Oh, Cheetos, man.
[147:05.31]Whoa!
[147:21.39]Dude, my favorite part about eating a potato chip or a corn chip is feeling like you were blocking yourself from having a bloody nose.
[147:29.44]Ah, I love it!
[147:30.60]I love like the, it's like, oh, I had a bloody nose and I'm running to the bathroom.
[147:33.92]Like, I love that.
[147:35.20]It's really interesting.
[147:36.48]Here's the funny spaceship blue ones.
[147:48.33]What's the difference?
[147:51.97]What's the difference?
[147:55.97]What's so funny?
[148:01.19]Blue ones are better?
[148:02.02]Do they have MSG?
[148:04.38]They do.
[148:04.72]Alright, so hold on.
[148:06.42]These are blue heat Takis.
[148:08.98]I put these in F. And already, like, I've already, what the fuck, man?
[148:30.48]What are these supposed to taste like?
[148:31.34]What are these supposed to taste like?
[148:44.83]It's the same.
[148:46.15]Yeah, these are like the same.
[148:48.11]Why make blue ones?
[148:53.29]You want to try?
[148:55.18]They taste like the same.
[148:57.17]Is it just like a marketing thing where they're just blue and it's like LOL or something?
[149:06.10]I mean, I... How do you feel?
[149:07.74]I actually really like these.
[149:12.70]You like these?
[149:14.02]Yeah.
[149:14.26]I didn't think I would.
[149:16.70]I didn't think I would.
[149:18.82]I feel like if I say, oh, well, there's a difference.
[149:21.14]Everyone's going to be like, read the ingredients.
[149:22.40]They're identical.
[149:22.96]And I'm going to look like an idiot.
[149:31.07]It's like I was fucking drywalling.
[149:36.03]These are... White boy spice level.
[149:42.34]What, because I coughed?
[149:43.22]What are you talking about?
[149:44.06]What, I like coughed for a second?
[149:48.64]Why did I... I need to... Hold on.
[150:03.16]Oh wait, thumbnail.
[150:06.82]Which one's better?
[150:08.22]Blue or red?
[150:09.76]Blue or red?
[150:10.88]Which one's better?
[150:11.60]And put a bunch of noodles in my mouth.
[150:29.16]The red ones are, like, more acidic.
[150:32.21]The blue ones are kind of better.
[150:34.51]But why are they blue?
[150:35.67]Just make them fucking green.
[150:37.05]Wow, that would be stupid, too.
[150:38.57]Just make them red.
[150:39.71]Just call them, like, tuckies.
[150:40.85]Like, salt and pepper or something.
[150:43.57]I don't know.
[150:48.45]Hold on a minute, guys.
[150:49.07]I just had a snack.
[150:49.74]I have to wash my fucking whole body.
[150:51.02]I have to take a shower.
[151:01.49]Oh, did somebody get into the talkies?
[151:03.69]Oh, no, man, sure.
[151:04.79]Don't tell anybody.
[151:05.63]I'm trying to be sneaky about it.
[151:29.17]Alright, so what's next?
[151:30.89]What's next?
[151:33.57]Oh, okay.
[151:34.17]Blue is better than red.
[151:35.76]But blue comes down a half a letter grade because they're blue and I don't like it.
[151:39.42]It's stupid.
[151:39.80]It's artificial fucking coloring.
[151:41.90]Red is artificial coloring too.
[151:44.82]They both see.
[151:45.55]But put blue, put them at the same.
[151:47.01]Who cares?
[151:47.33]Yeah, I think it matters.
[152:00.40]I get blue I only want to eat blue foods no you can't see blue food yes I can oh dude Frank's red hot let's go alright the spice let's just stay with it so though I put those in f but they're they're actually not this I have oh this is f I always think this is f I'm gonna end up using this for a stew or something right eventually
[152:31.10]But do I actually think this is that bad?
[152:34.39]You're an iPad baby.
[152:35.43]Okay, here we go.
[152:38.25]Ooh.
[152:51.33]What?
[152:53.33]It's not hot, Frank's... The whole thing about Frank's Red Hot is it's heat.
[152:56.90]It's flavor.
[152:57.76]It's not like hot hot.
[152:59.92]No.
[153:01.96]If I want to, what's that show where the guy's like, hey, so on Instagram, what's it called?
[153:06.40]Hot Ones?
[153:07.75]And the manager's like, oh, we got Frank's Red Hot here.
[153:09.87]I'd be like, you do?
[153:10.61]Okay, here we go.
[153:15.69]Frank's Red Hot.
[153:17.21]How many Skullville units?
[153:20.17]Oh, boy, oh, boy.
[153:21.91]40.
[153:21.93]Whew.
[153:40.97]It's alright.
[153:41.65]It's okay.
[153:49.61]Where's my ice cream?
[153:50.84]It's alright.
[153:53.80]It's just that I would rather have... Mmm...
[154:01.83]You know what?
[154:02.72]Okay, buffalo sauce like this, it's the default just buffalo flavor sauce, which is not like there's something wrong with it.
[154:11.48]It tastes good.
[154:12.72]You want to try it?
[154:13.20]Oh, I thought you were coming to try it.
[154:15.19]I was like, oh boy, here it comes.
[154:19.05]No, it's not hot at all.
[154:23.37]I want blue food and I want milk.
[154:29.44]It's got a nice flavor.
[154:32.30]sriracha is better sriracha is it f I actually like wanted to have sriracha up here but I was like I actually hate that and I won't eat it um the initial bite of Frank's is why you do it it's the flavor is there they get they became famous with having Frank's red hot be the default buffalo flavor on everything and it's it's it's good actually it's not even that bad it's really not bad
[155:02.46]It's just so easy to say the thing that is the default sucks.
[155:06.12]Now, it's not this sauce that I found in a fucking antique shop, right?
[155:10.00]But I think this is C. I think it belongs at C. More hot sauces?
[155:20.60]Want me to do a hot sauce taste test?
[155:24.60]We have a Serrano hot sauce?
[155:26.06]Serrano chili?
[155:31.67]I mean, Tabasco is S. I don't even need to taste it.
[155:33.83]Tabasco is literally S tier.
[155:36.61]Tapatio.
[155:37.19]Tapatio.
[155:39.16]Not for another day.
[155:39.86]For another day.
[155:40.54]I'm going to do it because I feel like I'm going to have diarrhea later.
[155:43.56]I don't want it to be like that included.
[155:46.20]Because if I had like, you know, 15 different candies and like 20 different like snacks, I don't want to like have it coated with like a painful sauce.
[155:54.28]Tabasco sucks.
[155:55.57]Get out of here.
[155:56.93]Get out.
[155:58.05]Tabasco sucks.
[155:58.81]Get out.
[156:00.41]Get out.
[156:03.19]Tabasco sucks.
[156:04.37]Get out.
[156:06.13]Sriracha is amazing.
[156:08.33]Your opinion is okay.
[156:10.23]I just don't like it.
[156:11.65]I would rather have Tabasco.
[156:13.82]Tabasco green sauce?
[156:16.28]Oh, if you've never had it before, it's perfect.
[156:18.92]Alright, we know that.
[156:20.42]Bugles.
[156:20.94]I mean, it's kind of hard to put a hot sauce above like a red delicious apple, right?
[156:28.65]That doesn't really work that way.
[156:31.48]Cholula?
[156:32.26]Tapatio, actually, I like more than Cholula.
[156:35.58]I could, wait, you want to face the bullshit with other stuff too?
[156:37.82]We can.
[156:38.10]Oh, I thought there was a grease on it.
[156:40.04]I thought there was like, I thought I touched it and it was like a grease stain.
[156:44.49]You want me to face the bullshit with other stuff?
[156:48.49]Alright, these are Bugles.
[156:49.51]These automatically start at a B because you can do this.
[157:04.17]That one's broken.
[157:09.56]I can't... Never mind.
[157:15.84]Back down to C to start.
[157:20.92]Okay.
[157:22.27]Alright, I was unfair.
[157:24.37]Okay.
[157:26.11]Wow.
[157:26.33]I get this F?
[157:33.19]I gave this F before.
[157:34.03]Did I actually put Bugles in F?
[157:39.62]I can't believe it.
[157:45.74]These are very good.
[157:48.12]Your fingers are too big?
[157:54.24]No, they changed the recipe.
[157:55.34]You can't put your fingers in them anymore.
[157:57.94]Okay, these...
[158:00.88]I had an idea of what the flavor was of Bugles.
[158:05.46]You know when you have that kind of dream memory of, like, the tasting a certain way?
[158:09.56]And it tastes like that in real life?
[158:12.17]But it's like a ten times better version than what you remembered?
[158:18.57]Because these were like, ew, that gross Bugle flavor.
[158:21.73]But now that I eat them... These are really good.
[158:30.10]I'm very surprised.
[158:32.24]These are just Fritos, but lighter and, like, more delicious.
[158:36.39]Shit, man.
[158:37.01]This is bad.
[158:37.81]These are going from F to, like, A. These are really good.
[158:50.05]America's number one finger... finger hat?
[158:53.86]Let's put that false advertising.
[158:56.90]False advertising!
[159:00.81]Finger in there.
[159:02.73]False advertising.
[159:14.44]It's for kids.
[159:18.78]Adults aren't supposed to care about that.
[159:24.30]That's true.
[159:25.10]You're right.
[159:25.52]Alright, Coke is an S. Bring it down to A.
[159:32.07]Oh.
[159:36.11]Fun difference is S. Holy shit.
[159:41.15]Yeah, these are an A. Yep, these are an A. I could eat this whole bag.
[159:49.22]I could eat that whole bag.
[159:50.84]Bugles.
[159:51.52]What a surprise.
[159:52.92]What a twist.
[159:54.42]What a twist.
[159:54.92]Oh my god.
[159:55.74]In the beginning of the video, you guys have no idea the twist.
[160:00.15]Like, I changed, like, four Fs.
[160:02.99]Keep watching to find out what they are.
[160:07.10]Chili Cheese Fritos.
[160:10.78]I know.
[160:11.42]These are dog shit.
[160:15.31]And they have Bugle.
[160:15.87]Yeah, they have Bugle Berries in the title.
[160:21.07]Okay.
[160:23.09]Chili Cheese Fritos.
[160:28.23]It's not that chili cheese Fritos taste bad.
[160:29.70]They're just too intense.
[160:31.44]They're just like too much.
[160:34.76]Fritos are fine, but it's just like, it's like too... It's like, remember when they did the like ketchup and mustard fucking potato chips?
[160:40.88]It's just like, that's, I don't want that.
[160:41.99]It's like too much weird shit on it.
[160:45.55]Oh my god.
[160:46.21]F. F. F. Oh my god, these are bad.
[160:48.99]These are fucking terrible.
[160:58.31]No way.
[160:58.92]It's like barbecue mixed with like chili.
[161:01.02]I don't know.
[161:02.50]These are bad.
[161:10.50]It's just like way too intense and deep.
[161:12.77]It's just too much.
[161:22.29]Hold on.
[161:26.18]Hold on.
[161:26.58]Hold on.
[161:26.90]Hold on.
[161:40.28]You know, sometimes you just get one that has way too much powder on it, and it just tastes like a fucking bowl of chili for like a quarter of a second.
[161:50.75]And I don't like it.
[162:14.67]You didn't shake the bag first?
[162:29.30]Ooh!
[162:37.45]I missed.
[162:40.19]There are...
[162:42.67]I don't like them, but I keep eating them.
[162:45.10]They're like a C. They're not F. They're just too intense.
[162:48.94]Too many different flavors.
[162:52.14]Just too many flavors.
[162:52.80]There's just too many flavors and too much dust.
[162:57.74]You gotta hear the crunch?
[162:59.22]Oh yeah, you're right.
[163:00.74]Crunch test, crunch test, crunch test.
[163:02.22]You're right, crunch test.
[163:03.06]I'm gonna say I ate the one on the ground.
[163:07.56]Was that the one from the ground?
[163:08.88]No.
[163:10.68]Um, this C.
[163:12.92]See?
[163:13.02]Alright, washing hands.
[163:20.44]Here, Steve.
[163:31.45]Also, keep in mind, anything that is D plus or higher, I'm going to eat the whole bag.
[163:38.47]So like these chili cheese Fritos, they're going to get rolled up and I'll eat the whole thing.
[163:43.48]I'll eat the whole thing.
[163:44.60]I know that she'll have some, too.
[163:45.64]Okay.
[163:47.80]Uh, what do we got?
[163:50.66]Ugh!
[163:54.22]Kettle cooked sea salt and, uh... Salt and vinegar chips.
[164:02.89]Farm to smiles.
[164:04.77]Farm potatoes?
[164:07.28]Real potatoes, real farmers, delicious chips.
[164:11.38]Carefully crafted for you.
[164:15.70]Shake the bag.
[164:17.82]Yeah, everyone had talked a lot of shit.
[164:20.12]These are god tier to a lot of you.
[164:22.43]S tier, god tier.
[164:24.31]I think that salt and vinegar chips are gross.
[164:26.59]I haven't eaten them in five years, at least.
[164:29.31]But I'm going to do it for you right now, and you're going to get a live reaction.
[164:32.10]And make sure you stay tuned to find out what I felt about the trolleys.
[164:42.87]They smell pretty good.
[164:44.35]You want some?
[164:45.91]So you really like these?
[164:46.73]I don't know.
[164:48.39]Oh, you haven't had them?
[164:50.47]Have you ever had salt and vinegar chips?
[164:52.42]Um, at the beach.
[164:53.00]Alright, here we go.
[164:54.78]Mmm.
[165:06.77]Mmm.
[165:07.21]Yeah, that's really good.
[165:09.47]They just taste like chips that something's wrong with them.
[165:15.33]Like, yeah, I mean, but it tastes like, it tastes like chips where there's something wrong with them.
[165:27.65]I would rather just have them be salt.
[165:34.18]Are they F though?
[165:35.58]I feel that's maybe not fair.
[165:40.72]Hmm?
[165:43.38]I have a pregnant palate.
[165:46.12]Excuse me?
[165:48.12]How?
[165:49.66]How do you figure I have a pregnant palate?
[165:52.60]What do you mean?
[165:55.10]I'm not eating, like, ice cream and hot dogs.
[165:57.10]What are you talking about?
[165:57.84]He's a D. He's a D. I just, I would rather than just be sea salt.
[166:15.05]Yeah, I want these to be sea salt.
[166:18.01]They just put a bunch of, like, sour stuff all over them.
[166:19.79]50.
[166:22.65]They leveled up from F, but... No.
[166:25.49]Not into it.
[166:30.28]The bugles though.
[166:30.92]Holy shit.
[166:31.66]I want to eat more of those.
[166:32.54]Alright.
[166:34.92]Here we go.
[166:35.26]A couple years ago.
[166:38.12]Hold on, I'm enjoying...
[166:44.41]A couple years ago, I put SunChips in F. And I literally lost like 5,000 subs in a day.
[166:56.30]I lost 20,000 followers.
[166:58.78]I lost 1,000 subs over the course of like every day.
[167:02.22]Because people said that it's insane that you put those there.
[167:06.19]Because it's crazy that you don't like these.
[167:09.69]And even my girlfriend is like, I don't understand that.
[167:12.60]They're just plain.
[167:14.06]It's like a corn chip, but like... I don't know, but it's plain.
[167:18.40]It's just too plain.
[167:19.08]They're way too plain for me.
[167:20.72]Way too plain.
[167:21.38]Yeah, but there's a middle ground.
[167:24.08]There's like a way too much, and then there's like bland nothing flavor.
[167:28.82]You gotta have the perfect amount of spice.
[167:31.41]These, I don't know.
[167:32.23]We'll see, because I put those there too.
[167:33.55]Those are an F.
[167:35.68]They're just, they kind of just taste like nothing.
[167:37.16]They're just a kind of weird, like, grain.
[167:40.56]But again, I have not had a Sunchip in at least five, at least five years.
[167:49.13]First of all, the bag is wicked loud.
[167:50.81]You're gonna wake up your roommate in college, bro.
[167:58.33]Boring ass bullshit.
[168:06.87]no yeah bugles are better no these are these are why do you like these these are just better these are way better these are better in every way they're like 100 whole grain it's 100 whole grain
[168:35.12]But like, this is just like the corn flakes of chips.
[168:41.92]I'm eating a bag of corn flakes.
[168:51.96]100% whole grain, heart healthy, no artificial flavors or preservatives, and 30% less fat than regular potato chips.
[168:58.01]You know what else has 30% less fat than regular potato chips?
[169:02.55]Baked Lay's, which Baked Lay's rest here.
[169:07.22]Bakelays are Omega S tier.
[169:13.19]This is Cope and Seething.
[169:18.33]The Garden Veggie?
[169:20.25]I mean, these were very highly rated, too.
[169:22.37]I'm telling you, I'm just giving my real opinion.
[169:26.06]At least F. Am I going to piss everybody off by actually eating these and saying they're F on camera?
[169:35.30]How do you get the wrong... These are just like Sun Chip original flavor.
[169:41.70]I want Garden Salsa.
[169:44.02]I want Garden Salsa.
[169:46.74]No, this is it.
[169:48.04]I don't want another one.
[169:54.53]F. F. F. F.
[170:04.96]Not into it.
[170:06.61]Alright.
[170:07.29]French onion.
[170:08.63]These were very highly rated.
[170:09.99]Incredibly highly rated.
[170:16.72]Smells much better.
[170:25.38]This is French onion garden grain.
[170:40.07]Alright.
[170:44.85]Yeah.
[170:46.35]Ten times better.
[170:51.21]I would say a hundred times better.
[170:52.19]Remember, 2,000 people left.
[170:57.30]Enjoy your fucking, like, bland-ass chips.
[171:05.46]These are actually pretty good.
[171:07.28]These are really good.
[171:11.53]That's what I mean.
[171:11.95]You gotta get me something.
[171:12.99]I don't want to just eat, like, fucking corn.
[171:17.93]Is it S?
[171:19.04]What were these?
[171:19.54]A?
[171:21.86]Ingredients.
[171:22.56]Demented yellow, de-germed yellow corn meal.
[171:28.24]Yeah.
[171:30.70]These suck.
[171:32.42]These are better.
[171:33.84]Let me show you on camera.
[171:37.13]These are made from the same material.
[171:38.73]These are made from the same material.
[171:40.36]This one was made by FromSoftware.
[171:42.56]This one... Was made by... What's a game company that everybody hates?
[171:49.60]This one was made... Can I say it?
[171:51.22]But be careful.
[171:52.70]This one... This one was made by... I was gonna say... What's like a... I don't know.
[172:03.35]This one was made by...

[172:38.53]This does it right.
[172:40.39]Not a whole lot of sweetness.
[172:42.89]Not a whole lot of spice.
[172:44.47]Not a whole lot of salt.
[172:47.15]There's a bee.
[172:48.67]There's a bee.
[172:49.21]These are actually good.
[172:49.85]These are very good.
[172:50.39]I was wrong.
[172:53.11]Yeah.
[172:55.23]There's a bee.
[172:57.51]You're weak.
[172:59.13]Nobody likes plain chips.
[173:00.13]That's what I'm saying.
[173:00.67]It's just plain.
[173:02.28]I don't want to eat those.
[173:06.02]I actually don't want to eat these.
[173:09.07]I would rather eat one of Otto's milk bones than one of these.
[173:15.69]These are pork rinds?
[173:21.27]But what if I'm full of shit?
[173:25.67]I could be full of shit.
[173:26.45]Am I full of shit, though?
[173:27.87]I feel like I just pretend like I don't like these.
[173:29.66]That's the whole point of the stream.
[173:31.04]The whole point of this show, this television show.
[173:34.46]Hmm?
[173:49.00]Shermer, you're a bad streamer.
[173:50.20]I wasn't gonna give you the finger, but I'm gonna be the bigger man.
[173:58.87]Hot sauce?
[174:00.95]On these?
[174:01.63]Yeah, grab it.
[174:26.70]Okay.
[174:34.32]Don't come over here.
[174:35.74]Don't?
[174:36.10]Wait, what happened?
[174:37.46]Did you just melt?
[174:38.18]I'm telling you, you don't want to be here.
[174:39.30]Did you fart?
[174:40.36]No, I didn't fart.
[174:44.63]No, I didn't.
[174:45.91]I'm just going to get a little one.
[174:56.72]That's a huge one!
[174:57.78]Pork rinds.
[175:15.57]Why?
[175:16.27]It's probably delicious.
[175:17.53]Why am I acting like there's a bug in my hand?
[175:30.26]It's just literally like bacon.
[175:33.38]It's just bacon chips.
[175:38.10]Very dry.
[175:39.68]Let's try it with the good old Tapatio.
[175:49.22]They smelled awful.
[175:50.70]And I mean like really bad.
[175:51.72]Are you saying what, like a drop or two?
[176:17.02]I mean, the smell is truly awful.
[176:23.28]Like, it smells... Out of everything we've opened today, by far, this stinks.
[176:29.35]I don't know why I came out.
[176:32.65]I sound so weird.
[176:34.53]But it's really not good.
[176:36.83]They're very dry.
[176:38.74]Yeah, they're very dry, but a little bit of the top to you.
[176:42.40]It was like, just kind of bacon.
[176:43.50]That was, that was, that was kind of good.
[176:47.24]One more, one more, one more.
[176:52.26]I don't, I like, don't like it, but it's like, I can't, I don't know.
[176:55.20]I kind of, I could see this being really good.
[177:00.04]Like, I don't know, maybe like a crushed up.
[177:06.96]The smell will go away.
[177:12.78]Holly we're gonna be sleeping in different rooms tonight that's good that's good I'm not gonna I can't lie to you and be like oh pork rice man I fucking hate being on camera um they're definitely not f but they're definitely not higher than like a d plus maybe like a c minus or something what's up what's the height what's the highest thing in d
[177:44.21]Salt and vinegar chips are better than that.
[177:46.71]Where's Red Delicious Apple?
[177:47.65]Put it right in the middle.
[178:05.55]Almond Joy.
[178:05.91]I'd rather have an Almond Joy.
[178:10.03]Alright, here we go.
[178:14.59]I mean, it's hard to do hot sauce.
[178:16.63]I mean, this is better than Frank's.
[178:18.96]You know, top it to you.
[178:21.04]You want a good little bit of spice on your whatever it is.
[178:26.11]This is the best stuff.
[178:28.39]You want to face the bullshit?
[178:30.19]I will face the bullshit.
[178:31.21]This and Tabasco are the best hot sauces you can buy at the grocery store.
[178:37.22]Tapatio.
[178:38.10]Trust me.
[178:39.48]You're going to want it.
[178:41.18]Hey, Tapatio.
[178:44.00]Good till it's gone.
[178:47.02]Actually, you know what?
[178:47.74]Let's go.
[178:52.82]I love this stuff.
[178:53.96]It's so good on tacos and so good, but it can go good on everything.
[178:57.68]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[178:58.92]It's so good, I put it on my ice cream.
[179:00.26]You know what I mean?
[179:02.80]It's very good.
[179:07.31]Stop it.
[179:07.93]It's just vinegar.
[179:08.77]No, it's not.
[179:13.61]That was not based.
[179:16.61]Okay, so we're almost done.
[179:19.06]We've got cashews and bread.
[179:26.10]If I got a blood test right now, they would probably think I was from an alien planet.
[179:32.66]What's going on with your levels?
[179:34.18]They're all fucked up.
[179:35.06]What did you do?
[179:38.30]Ooh, that was a... Did you see the freshness?
[179:40.36]Did you get a look at that freshness?
[179:43.39]That was fresh.
[179:46.37]But they're cashews, so they're disgusting.
[179:48.83]I fucking hate these.
[179:51.75]I actually hate cashews.
[179:52.97]I think they're the worst.
[179:55.48]It's just like meaty, like too like, bleh.
[179:57.68]It's just like gamey.
[180:01.26]It's like cashews are like the venison of the peanut world.
[180:06.56]There's like too much.
[180:07.86]Here we go.
[180:08.88]Oh my god.
[180:23.42]I was so wrong.
[180:28.10]Wait.
[180:31.97]I just don't like them.
[180:40.18]I just don't like them.
[180:40.72]I don't like the shape either.
[180:51.25]I'm telling you.
[180:52.48]Eat these instead.
[180:53.52]It's the same shit.
[180:54.88]This is made out of cornmeal.
[180:56.40]This is made out of fucking gross nuts.
[181:00.58]No, I mean they're different.
[181:01.58]These are made out of completely... This is way better.
[181:05.98]That's D-.
[181:07.12]What's at the bottom of D?
[181:09.70]Okay, would I rather have cashews or Red Delicious?
[181:12.16]Red Delicious.
[181:14.42]I would rather eat five Red Delicious apples before I had ten of those.
[181:20.27]Yeah.
[181:22.59]I know, I'm crazy.
[181:26.09]No, I don't like this.
[181:26.67]The flavor just doesn't, it's just not good.
[181:29.90]This is not good.
[181:32.26]Okay, that's all the snacks.
[181:34.12]It is time to eat bread.
[181:38.04]We're gonna start with butter bread.
[181:50.73]I never had it.
[181:51.85]People said, dude, you're fucking crazy.
[181:55.94]I'm just gonna try a little bit.
[181:58.44]Um, no, this is fine.
[181:59.36]I'm just gonna take a little bit.
[182:02.26]I have whole wheat bread here.
[182:03.74]Gross.
[182:04.56]And I have sourdough here.
[182:05.86]Even grosser.
[182:09.22]Butter bread.
[182:09.78]I'm not gonna eat a shitload of it.
[182:13.32]I'm just gonna have like a little piece.
[182:17.49]Dude, the zip ties are the USB sticks of the food world.
[182:22.68]I'm never going the right way.
[182:25.24]I can never get it right the first way.
[182:26.20]What do you mean wrong brand?
[182:28.84]What are you talking about?
[182:30.30]It's just freaking default bread.
[182:35.78]Wrong brand Andy.
[182:37.10]Alright, I finally got it off.
[182:39.26]Okay, this is butter bread.
[182:40.25]What do you mean wrong brand?
[182:50.94]Here is a piece of butter bread.
[182:53.26]I've never eaten this and I was like, I don't want it.
[182:55.24]It sounds gross.
[183:00.84]Enjoy the glucose, you idiot.
[183:04.62]Thanks, doc.
[183:08.36]Butter bread.
[183:10.62]Why'd you take the third slice?
[183:13.70]I don't know.
[183:18.15]No, we're doing this default.
[183:19.65]I'm not going to play into your horse shit.
[183:21.75]No, what you do, you didn't dip it in like butter, put it in the toaster oven, let it sit for an hour, cut it in half, put a little bit of sugar on it.
[183:28.58]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[183:29.66]We're eating this as it is.
[183:30.80]You're not going to do any bullshit on me.
[183:32.66]Here we go.
[183:33.32]Butter bread.
[183:42.29]Sweet.
[183:43.87]It's sweet.
[183:47.07]Sugary.
[183:53.19]It's like a nice sweetness.
[184:01.96]It does kind of taste like a little buttery.
[184:04.54]This is really good sandwich bread.
[184:06.78]Mmm.
[184:08.58]Yeah, like I can see a nice slab of ham on there.
[184:11.48]A nice slab of fucking Swiss cheese.
[184:13.62]A nice slab of fucking mustard.
[184:15.82]Oh yeah, I can see it.
[184:22.79]A nice ham sandwich with this I think would be pretty good.
[184:24.97]This is high.
[184:34.46]It's kind of like a better version of white bread.
[184:37.34]What is this?
[184:38.74]What is this stuff?
[184:41.18]What is this?
[184:47.08]What is this?
[184:48.18]How do they get it to taste like this?
[184:49.68]Is it just butter?
[184:51.62]A slab of mustard?
[184:52.42]Yeah.
[184:55.42]I think this is like a B. You don't even need to put butter on this.
[185:04.64]I'm telling you, put this in the toaster oven.
[185:06.56]Light toast.
[185:07.54]Don't even put butter on it.
[185:08.28]I think it's fine.
[185:09.52]You don't even need it.
[185:13.30]Mmm.
[185:15.74]That's a solid B. Nobody can have this.
[185:20.50]Nobody can have any of this.
[185:24.39]Alright, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[185:25.53]What do you think?
[185:27.55]Like, hey.
[185:28.43]How do you do it?
[185:32.68]Fold it over.
[185:34.16]Set it down.
[185:37.40]That's how I do it.
[185:41.19]It's glucose.
[185:42.39]Glucose Andy.
[185:44.35]Alright, I know I'm not going to like this, but whatever.
[185:46.31]This is whole wheat bread.
[185:47.23]I got the wrong brand.
[185:51.31]Sorry, I didn't get your, like, craft beer bread brand.
[185:54.97]I had literally, like, less than 24 hours to get all this.
[186:00.21]Dude, you didn't get, like, the craft, like, micro brew beer, whatever.
[186:04.70]It's bread.
[186:08.06]This is 100% whole wheat.
[186:11.12]And it's going to be an F.
[186:13.95]Let's take a look at the Kula.
[186:16.85]Pretty nice.
[186:17.87]Pretty nice marbling.
[186:20.09]Color is there.
[186:22.11]That's definitely wheat bread.
[186:29.56]IPA millennial bread.
[186:36.74]Yeah.
[186:37.04]It's definitely wheat.
[186:37.48]It's whole wheat.
[186:38.06]It definitely is.
[186:42.74]Hold on.
[186:43.00]Let's...
[186:46.56]yep okay the aroma that comes out here we go I already know what this is gonna taste like and I don't like it it's communion bread
[187:19.83]It's just bread, dude.
[187:20.91]Why are you eating it like this?
[187:22.99]That's the worst sourdough I've ever seen.
[187:25.35]This is not sourdough.
[187:27.09]We haven't even opened the sourdough yet.
[187:28.77]This is not sourdough.
[187:32.39]It's just bread.
[187:33.39]Who gives a shit about any of this?
[187:36.43]Who gives a shit about any of what you're watching?
[187:38.65]Who gives a shit about this?
[187:40.83]Oh, white bread is better than wheat bread.
[187:42.54]It's better than sourdough.
[187:44.40]Who cares?
[187:48.50]But this is bad.
[187:52.03]I just bit my lip.
[187:54.77]It's F. It's just F. Whole wheat bread is just so plain.
[187:58.34]Okay.
[188:00.38]These are the same.
[188:01.46]These are the same in my brain.
[188:03.32]It's so plain.
[188:05.20]It's plain and just like cardboardy.
[188:08.79]These are the same.
[188:10.48]I don't like whole wheat bread.
[188:11.92]I don't like whole wheat chips, whole grain.
[188:15.08]No, give me some flavoring.
[188:16.12]Get that goddamn fucking fucked up bee to come over and sprinkle the honey on my Cheerios.
[188:21.04]Like, I need something.
[188:22.68]It can't just be plain.
[188:25.26]Here's the sourdough.
[188:27.37]And this is... This is grandma's... Grandma Sycamore's homemade bread.
[188:36.37]You better be fucking nice to grandma, alright?
[188:38.47]Or I better be.
[188:42.61]New Grandma Sycamore Sourdough.
[188:49.11]What's the wrong brand?
[188:50.21]There's no right brand of bread.
[188:58.42]Grandma... Grandma Sycomode.
[189:06.62]Grandma... This is Grandma baked every single one of these.
[189:10.66]Don't you get it?
[189:12.54]Sourdough.
[189:20.23]That's definitely sourdough.
[189:23.47]That is definitely sourdough.
[189:29.11]Alright, this is the last thing I'm eating.
[189:30.35]This is the last one.
[189:34.20]She's looking over here.
[189:35.80]She loves this shit.
[189:38.52]She's a huge fan of Grandma's sicko mode.
[189:48.79]I know it's not like the dude doesn't have like the swiss cheese holes it's that what yeah I had 24 hours alright here we go sourdough sandwich bread from grandma sycamore
[190:15.93]actually pretty the thing I hate about sourdough is it's like made out of glue go to the bakery and buy yeah alright bakery andy
[190:45.50]hey grandma you got a good thing here right it's good it's not like that super heavy like sourdough like like sour flavor it's good it's good grandma I'm wrong
[191:12.39]I think that's because you gave it to somebody said I gave it to you like I was feeding a duck grandma went fucking sick almost for this because I don't really like sourdough and this is this is pretty good this would like a say like it's got like that it's light who made this grandma sycamore homemade bread hold on a minute
[191:43.83]Grandma Sycamore's homemade bread has a fresh-baked, home-style taste and texture your family will love.
[191:49.66]True.
[191:53.86]Our breads are made without artificial preservatives, colors, or high-fructose corn syrup.
[191:58.81]Just ingredients you can trust.
[192:01.51]I'm sure you can trust Grandma Sycamore.
[192:04.11]Give our breads a try, and you'll see why we believe that nothing compares to Grandma Sycamore's.
[192:12.39]It has that, like, sour, sourdough flavor.
[192:15.35]But it's not, like, fucking tough as goddamn nails.
[192:18.42]That's why I don't like sourdough.
[192:21.44]You're holding the bread like a baby?
[192:22.82]I was reading this!
[192:27.62]Alright, Grandma Sicko... Uh, Grandma Sycamore.
[192:32.89]Alright, stop saying that.
[192:35.03]Grandma Sycamore, that's a...
[192:37.44]Alright, I'm biased because I don't like sourdough.
[192:40.40]So remember, like a C plus for me for sourdough might be like a B or an A for you.
[192:45.81]But I'm not a big fan of sourdough.
[192:47.05]But Grandma Sycamore didn't miss.
[192:50.05]That's a C plus.
[192:52.91]I actually did not.
[192:54.17]I will probably have a sandwich with this later.
[192:58.15]Okay, you know what I'm talking about?
[192:59.89]Like that sourdough flavor is there.
[193:03.90]But not like the chewy sourdough toughness.
[193:08.30]Grandma.
[193:09.72]Pretty good.
[193:10.74]Pretty good.
[193:15.99]Oh, let me see.
[193:22.97]Fun Dip.
[193:26.05]Coke.
[193:28.23]Yep.
[193:28.41]7% battery power.
[193:28.93]Alright, Red Hot is not rated, but Red Hot, like, doesn't, I don't know, doesn't need to be.
[193:38.41]Alright, I think, what's state in F?
[193:41.43]It looks like sun chips, state in F, Swedish fish.
[193:45.62]Wheat bread, Tootsie Rolls.
[193:46.82]Is that honeydew melon?
[193:49.22]Yeah, yeah.
[193:50.26]I thought that was an avocado.
[193:55.90]Jelly beans.
[193:56.44]Yeah, the butter jelly beans are gross.
[193:59.02]Grapefruit is still going to stay down there.
[194:00.38]Mountain Dew is down there.
[194:01.44]Yeah, this makes sense to me.
[194:03.14]Surprises, though.
[194:04.42]We have a few surprises.
[194:07.34]Bugles.
[194:08.66]Big twist.
[194:10.19]I thought I hated those.
[194:11.67]Those were all the way up to A. Fun Dip I thought was a disgusting thing for children.
[194:16.01]In fact, adults can enjoy it, too.
[194:19.75]But you can't bring that to the office.
[194:22.03]Fun Dip is at S. Bugles went up to A.
[194:26.57]Yeah, these were good.
[194:28.27]The sun chips.
[194:32.37]I would definitely put the bread... Put the sun chips above the bread.
[194:40.33]And then put the green sun chips.
[194:45.77]I think this is good.
[194:47.29]Frito's Whoppers went up, too.
[194:50.65]Whoppers went up from F. I'm actually pretty surprised by some of this.
[194:54.27]Mike and Ike said... Those are F, too.
[194:59.84]No, put butter bread at sea.
[195:02.21]Definitely put butter bread behind grandma.
[195:04.97]Because, I mean, there's no way that's better.
[195:08.53]Yeah.
[195:12.03]I knew that I still wasn't going to like Swedish fish.
[195:14.19]Or Tootsie Rolls.
[195:16.81]You're an iPad kid.
[195:21.53]Well, there you have it.
[195:23.47]You want to come grab your phone?
[195:26.81]There you go.
[195:27.89]Hold it that way.

[195:32.92]Otto's just been chilling here the whole time.
[195:35.22]He's just, he's like, I'm eating like bread and stuff.
[195:38.10]And he's just like, like, no, you're not getting any of this.
[195:43.20]What about the Frank's, Frank Red Hot?
[195:45.58]I mean, it's hard.
[195:47.07]You can't like put, it's hard to put hot sauce here.
[195:52.07]That has to be a whole nother day.
[195:54.83]Okay, so in the chat, on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being, this was a really fun stream, you should do it again.
