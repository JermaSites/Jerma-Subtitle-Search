[00:37.75]Next enemy we get, we'll try out the eagle thing.
[00:40.71]Oh, yeah.
[00:41.37]Good call.
[00:41.87]I want to whip my eagle at somebody.
[00:47.28]We should name it Nine Toes, so it has three balls.
[00:51.98]Level up.
[00:52.42]Time to collect.
[00:53.20]Go to Dr. Zed in Firestone and collect your reward.
[00:55.92]That's all we have to do?
[00:56.66]I guess we just have to go back.
[00:58.32]To the freak.
[01:00.74]Yeah, to the medic.
[01:03.64]Alright, that's right.
[01:04.28]I'm going to throw the eagle.
[01:05.98]Eagle, go!
[01:06.62]Oh, yeah.

[01:12.48]Here, wait.
[01:12.74]I think we're going to have some guys right here.
[01:14.72]Maybe we can test it out on them.
[01:19.13]I like the fact that I have sexy ninja time.
[01:22.39]Yeah, that's wicked funny.
[01:24.75]You just run and then, yeah, you turn into an atom bomb, essentially, is what happens.
[01:28.93]I can't jump, though.
[01:29.79]That's kind of weird.
[01:32.02]I wish there was something that made it last a little bit longer though.
[01:35.63]I guarantee you that later on it was a skill point that let you do it.
[01:39.37]Um, what did this guy do?
[01:40.67]You did Firestone a great service by eliminating 9 toes.
[01:44.24]Unfortunately he was a cog in the machine.
[01:46.76]The real problem is his boss Sledge.
[01:50.48]Wait, what the butt is this?
[01:51.72]So pretty much, yeah.
[01:52.42]It says MIRV.
[01:54.67]Check the bounty board.
[01:56.41]Okay.
[01:57.25]Bounty board.
[01:58.47]I can do that.
[01:59.33]I can do that.
[01:59.95]What's a quick charge gorilla?
[02:01.65]Oh, there's a special.
[02:03.65]For 1057.
[02:05.09]It gives you thermal stuff.
[02:07.47]Get a new shield that's actually good.
[02:08.75]I don't think I have the cash for that.
[02:11.25]Actually, no, yeah, I do.
[02:12.01]Now, after we turn that in, I got a lot of money.
[02:15.42]Yeah, same here.
[02:17.84]I'm gonna get the accelerated healing one.
[02:21.35]Oh, what's a desert thumper?
[02:22.63]What does purple mean?
[02:23.67]Actually, I gotta sell some stuff.
[02:26.86]Here, alright.
[02:27.72]The desert thumper.
[02:29.00]The only thing that goes down is the fire rate.
[02:31.06]But it's 5,000.
[02:31.72]How much money do I have?
[02:33.64]Damn.
[02:35.52]I have 13 minutes to get 5,000.
[02:39.05]These SMGs are good.
[02:40.93]I swear.
[02:41.53]These things are amazing.
[02:44.75]Yeah, I mean... The rate of fire is just awesome.
[02:48.15]Being able to just like...
[02:51.32]Oh, an incendiary machine pistol.
[02:53.08]Alright, I sold a ton of stuff.
[02:56.96]Now I should have enough money to do something.
[03:00.62]Oh, I'm buying the incendiary machine pistol.
[03:04.28]Oh, this is happening.
[03:05.08]Let's see.
[03:07.80]Terrible.
[03:08.42]I'm getting rid of the terrible shotgun because it's terrible.
[03:13.09]Alright.
[03:14.35]Now, get rid of the shield.
[03:16.85]Standard shield.
[03:19.31]Incendiary machine pistol.
[03:22.55]although that's beast all the reload speed is slow as hell no home well milk you'll be able to test it out and see if it's if it's you know you can rip through people or not I mean it has fired also that's that's good here we moving you uh... yes we are let's go I wouldn't have guys are on this corner can see all red dots Marcus regal I'm going to go into super sexy ninja mode
[03:53.29]There's a lot of them.
[03:57.59]Oh, wow.
[03:58.69]That was pretty stellar.
[04:01.33]Oh.
[04:02.96]Look at that.
[04:03.44]Take that.
[04:04.20]Absolutely take that.
[04:05.26]See what that did?
[04:05.90]100% more melee damage.
[04:08.74]Oh, the Skag is attacking him.
[04:10.58]Wait, I just need to get my machine pistol back.
[04:13.70]That thing you just picked up is going to give you 100% more melee damage.
[04:19.15]So you smash somebody with that thing?
[04:21.97]You're talking about a bad day.
[04:27.07]Alright, I think we have to go in here.
[04:29.09]Yeah, we didn't check the bounty.
[04:30.27]Where's this bounty point?
[04:31.59]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[04:33.11]I need to use my experience points.
[04:36.27]Oh, good call.
[04:38.01]What should I do?
[04:39.17]Increase your chance of causing elemental effects with weapons.
[04:42.70]Increase your critical hit damage.
[04:45.00]Oh, I'll just increase my critical hit damage because I do the jumping headshots a lot.
[04:50.21]You're definitely a good call.
[04:52.27]I'm going the sniper route just because this one is focused.
[04:55.63]And I'll increase my shield capacity.
[04:58.21]Sick.
[05:00.13]Yeah, this one, I'm definitely going the sniper route.
[05:02.39]The point I just used is I get more accurate.
[05:04.16]Wait, are we supposed to go in here or not?
[05:05.84]Oh, no, we have to go back to the bounty board.
[05:07.82]Yeah.
[05:08.72]Where is the bounty board?
[05:09.86]Is it in town?
[05:11.04]Oh, shit.
[05:13.96]You alright there?
[05:15.20]They're hopping the fence.
[05:16.84]Oh, my God.
[05:17.70]They're hopping this fence back here.
[05:20.44]I killed them, but that was kind of scary.
[05:21.72]Alright, let's get out of here.
[05:23.44]Yeah, before anything bad happens.
[05:25.46]Yeah, I'm going to go into super sexy ninja mode to get to the bounty board.
[05:30.92]You know, that's actually going to be very, very useful because you're going to be able to do that and complete quests for us when I can just stand here and be like a real jerk.
[05:41.75]Alright, job hunting.
[05:45.10]Alright, TK has more work.
[05:47.04]No.
[05:48.00]Let's go find and use the catch a ride station outside of Firestone.
[05:53.08]Catch a ride station.
[05:54.27]Oh, this one's difficulty normal.
[05:55.69]Which one should we do?
[05:57.91]The reward for the level 10 one?
[05:59.53]Oh no, we can't do that one yet.
[06:02.29]Alright, we have to go to catch a ride.
[06:03.77]Let's catch a ride.
[06:07.56]Oh, see that?
[06:08.92]You can now work on more than one mission at a time.
[06:14.49]There we go, use Keteride.
[06:16.97]That was it.
[06:18.55]Bonehead's theft.
[06:20.47]Get the Digistruct module from Bonehead.
[06:23.75]Bonehead?
[06:24.33]Now we have to go over there.
[06:27.13]Oh, this is going to be enjoyable.
[06:29.41]Was this the hard one?
[06:31.66]Yeah, this is another boss, I think.
[06:33.30]Oh, okay.
[06:33.92]Alright, wait up.
[06:35.64]Let me just regain my sexy...
[06:40.69]Whatever.
[06:41.19]Ninja mode.
[06:44.57]And when are you going to use your eagle?
[06:47.09]I'll just throw it in there when we... Which we have yet to name.
[06:50.10]Wait, we have to go in here.
[06:51.28]I missed it.
[06:51.66]Let's grab some monies.
[06:57.10]You know what we could do?
[07:00.90]If you got a good name, guys, that are watching that eagle, definitely let us know.
[07:05.81]I see the guy in the back.
[07:06.99]See him?
[07:08.91]You want me to go for a snipe?
[07:11.60]I know there should be guys around him, too.
[07:13.61]I mean, he wouldn't be alone.
[07:15.29]Is there a barrel around him that we can snipe or something?
[07:18.29]Looks like there's a barrel.
[07:19.71]Here, wait.
[07:20.47]Get a headshot on him, and I'll shoot the barrel if he comes running towards us.
[07:23.59]Just watch out for other guys.
[07:24.80]Go.
[07:25.48]Alright.
[07:25.88]I got a... Ready?
[07:26.62]Here we go.
[07:27.10]Wait, wait, wait.
[07:27.98]He's walking towards the barrel.
[07:28.86]Ready?
[07:29.00]Alright.
[07:29.64]Shoot the barrel.
[07:30.16]Oh, worked out perfectly.
[07:34.52]Ready?
[07:38.21]He's got a shield.
[07:39.85]Ow.
[07:39.95]Ow.
[07:40.41]Ow.
[07:40.53]Ow.
[07:40.91]Ow.
[07:40.97]Ow.
[07:41.11]Ow.
[07:41.43]Ow.
[07:41.53]Ow.
[07:41.69]Ow.
[07:41.77]Ow.
[07:41.85]Ow.
[07:42.05]Ow.
[07:42.19]Ow.
[08:03.01]I'm still getting crits on his head.
[08:04.59]Are you still alive?
[08:05.68]Yeah, we definitely... I'm dead.
[08:07.82]We were not high enough to do this.
[08:11.62]Thanks for using the Hyperion personal construction system.
[08:15.96]We hope you enjoy the new you.
[08:18.29]See, these guys... Oh, get out of here.
[08:19.73]Get out of there.
[08:20.49]I can't.
[08:22.35]I'm dead.
[08:23.77]Did you die?
[08:24.27]Yeah.
[08:24.99]See, you know what it is?
[08:26.45]We're level 6 and they were level 11 and 13.
[08:31.66]So I think we're a little too far over our head right there.
[08:36.26]Maybe if we use nades.
[08:38.24]We could try it.
[08:38.90]I mean, they are like four or five levels higher than us.
[08:41.41]If we go in there and we just try and smoke show him, we should be able to do it if we try hard enough.
[08:48.17]Where are you?
[08:50.17]I'm out of nades.
[08:50.84]Maybe we should do the other jobs that we have.
[08:53.80]Yeah, just to get leveled up.
[08:55.56]Let's go check out the job board because there were two on there.
[08:57.79]Because you were saying, you were headshotting him over and over again.
[09:00.13]I was headshotting him too, and it was like, he was completely and totally fine.
[09:04.19]He had like, I think, 75% health at the end of that whole thing.
[09:07.49]Yeah.
[09:08.90]That was not smart.
[09:11.26]I tried killing you, but I could not.
[09:15.90]I am sorry.
[09:17.00]Never know until you try, right?
[09:19.94]Correct.
[09:21.33]Let's go see this TK Baja.
[09:24.43]Baja.

[09:48.91]Seat of your pants.
[09:49.93]Wait, wait.
[09:50.51]What is it?
[09:51.07]It has a sniper.
[09:53.39]By the seat of your pants, it has a sniper.
[09:56.17]And in the bottom right, it has a shotgun for TK's life and limb.
[09:59.89]Let's do this one first.
[10:01.39]Alright.
[10:01.59]We have to kill a Scar.
[10:05.87]And... whatever.
[10:07.37]In Skag, Gullion returned TK Baja's prosthetic leg.
[10:12.59]Prosthetic leg?
[10:14.13]Let's go get his prosthetic leg for him.
[10:16.57]Oh, jeez.
[10:17.28]That's kind of screwed up.
[10:20.53]way where where do we have to go I'll make sure that it's not selected you know you can select the the question where you give me a second known he's shooting them there's a this red dots over there I'm just trying to spot tracking this one let's go okay see it just changed on my screen that's good good good good good I'm just looking at those guys are evil
[10:52.77]So this is another boss fight, apparently?
[10:55.71]I guess.
[10:57.33]That guy is a freaking boss.
[10:58.87]I headshot him like 15 times.
[11:02.27]What the heck was that?
[11:03.13]I do not know.
[11:06.31]Are there skags here?
[11:08.83]Doesn't look like it.
[11:10.37]We killed them all.
[11:11.71]Their species has gone extinct.
[11:14.67]Quick mode sexy time, ninja.
[11:16.10]Yes.
[11:17.48]No, dammit.
[11:18.04]I got stuck.
[11:20.00]Ninja mode fail.
[11:22.70]I saw that on my screen.
[11:24.62]That was pretty funny.
[11:26.10]I just hit you twice.
[11:28.00]Like a sexy boy.
[11:30.39]Skaggully.
[11:32.89]I don't like this place, for some reason.
[11:36.17]Yeah.
[11:37.87]Oh, what is this?
[11:39.03]Firestone Bounty Board.
[11:42.47]Oh, it's a... some... it's weird.
[11:45.57]Okay, so we have a bunch of quests we can do... Well, I'm getting distracted.
[11:52.74]This is like Minecraft, but worse.
[11:56.36]Well, the Skag's down there, so don't go down there.
[12:01.12]Wow, how did that hit me?
[12:03.37]Go, bird!
[12:08.83]Oh, you ain't got nothing.
[12:17.98]Skag whelped.
[12:21.81]Oh wow, where are they coming from?
[12:23.39]They're still coming out of that hole?
[12:27.98]Watch out.
[12:28.68]Can we close up this hole with silly putty or something?
[12:33.02]Silly putty.
[12:35.36]Yeah, let's go up top over here.
[12:40.26]Can we jump this?
[12:41.76]No.
[12:43.16]Oh jeez!
[12:44.56]Oh jeez.
[12:46.42]Oh, I got a full hit on those guys.
[12:49.42]So, I got you back.
[12:51.04]I think that was you.
[12:53.04]Yeah, see, that thing does massive damage up close.
[13:00.24]Oh, wait, where do we need to go now?
[13:03.10]Um, I think we went the wrong way.
[13:04.40]Oh, wait, there's a little box over here.
[13:06.55]Free money in the corner.
[13:08.05]You know, because they stash it.
[13:09.65]Skags love to, you know, stack cash.
[13:12.87]Free money!
[13:13.59]Alright, I think we went the wrong way.
[13:16.20]Um, maybe over here and then around.
[13:18.88]Yeah, we have to go down here.
[13:20.92]Yeah, it's like a little... I think so, because there's a little... Can we go down there?
[13:29.27]I think.
[13:29.73]This is the only way to go.
[13:30.39]I don't want it to be like a drop to your death type deal.
[13:33.65]Um... I don't like you.
[13:42.31]That was perfect.
[13:46.46]I don't want it to be a drop to your death type deal.
[13:52.98]What just happened?
[13:54.60]I started combat.
[13:57.28]Why is the music playing like crazy right now?
[13:59.44]I don't know, because I'm being a boss right now.
[14:04.39]Okay, so we can't go that way, so where the hell are we supposed to go?
[14:07.63]I think we have to get up there somehow.
[14:11.86]Oh, what the heck?
[14:12.80]It just spit on me.
[14:13.84]Watch out for that acid breathing son of a bitch.
[14:18.62]Spitter stags.
[14:19.58]Fuck you.
[14:21.56]Yeah, those guys are pieces of shit.
[14:25.69]I love it how this thing keeps burning them though.
[14:28.81]The fire.
[14:29.33]Intense music.
[14:31.61]I'm not digging how the music keeps going.
[14:33.53]Yeah, this is like... Oh, there's another spitter.
[14:38.07]Oh, don't worry.
[14:38.61]Let me just miss three shots in a row.
[14:40.50]Oh, that's fine.
[14:42.02]Where is he?
[14:43.08]I'm picking him up.
[14:44.10]He's down.
[14:44.38]I got him.
[14:46.96]I got to put more points into that accuracy thing, man.
[14:50.33]Alright.
[14:50.85]Can we go up here?
[14:51.71]No, we already went up that way, didn't we?
[14:54.09]Wait, maybe we just have to do a circle around.
