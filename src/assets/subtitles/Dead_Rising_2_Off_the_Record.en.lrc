[00:01.64]Uh, hi guys.
[00:05.03]Do you want to see... I'm a little irritated.
[00:08.96]You want to see something that I cannot believe.
[00:12.38]I'm trying to figure out how this is even possible.
[00:16.34]First of all, sorry I'm a little bit late.
[00:17.84]I had some controller input issues because Dead Rising 2 does not actually have native controller support built into the PC version.
[00:26.45]So I had to get an emulator for that, and wow, what a pain in the ass.
[00:29.13]But even worse than that, somehow... Just skip the intro.
[00:35.07]Give me a scenario, any scenario, where at the menu screen, having art gallery, downloadable content, and import games for Windows Live is more important than the options menu.
[00:57.20]You gotta go into the fucking game.
[01:00.62]Into the actual video game to change settings.
[01:05.48]why is this here imagine getting this shown you're a boss you're the boss okay you're the boss of a video game company you make video games and this is what you're presented for the the menu for the game I'd be like go back and redo this whole thing
[01:29.89]This is like advertisements.
[01:33.91]Give me the options menu so I can check to see if my controller works.
[01:39.26]Let me change the graphics settings.
[01:41.48]What?
[01:45.46]Yeah, import games for Windows Live.
[01:48.22]That's more important.
[01:50.82]I'm surprised there's a goddamn quit button here.
[01:54.63]Anyways, how you doing?
[01:59.64]The game's 10 years old.
[02:00.98]The first one had it.
[02:03.72]The first game had this.
[02:06.65]Every game has this.
[02:08.29]It's not just 10 years.
[02:09.55]It's every fucking video game.
[02:11.85]Every video game has an options menu.
[02:15.29]Before you start the video game.
[02:21.79]Downloadable content?
[02:23.09]That's gotta be hidden in the options menu.
[02:25.85]Put these in the options menu.
[02:27.51]What, did you run out of time?
[02:33.88]Anyway, hi guys, we're going to play Dead Rising 2 off the record today.
[02:38.81]Why am I not playing the original game?
[02:40.19]Well, we had a lot of deliberation in the chat room.
[02:45.69]And, hold on, you can't even hear this.
[02:47.65]We had a lot of deliberation in the chat room.
[02:51.32]About which one I should play.
[02:53.14]Because I thought they were different games.
[02:55.33]But they're not.
[02:56.57]There was a lot of fighting.
[02:58.07]You have no idea.
[03:00.29]I'm sitting here trying to set up my controller.
[03:02.17]Emulate my goddamn Xbox One controller.
[03:04.77]I look over here and there's a fight.
[03:08.29]Like a brawl in the chat.
[03:10.23]About which version of the game should I play.
[03:12.57]And it was just like... People were throwing shit.
[03:15.55]Tables were flipped over.
[03:19.36]But it came to my realization that they are in fact the same video game.
[03:24.46]Told from different perspectives.
[03:26.08]The bosses and the items, everything's the same.
[03:29.68]This one has some extra content, is what I've been told.
[03:35.97]By like 70% of the people in the chat.
[03:41.69]This is not true.
[03:42.95]Literally not true.
[03:50.95]This one's not canon, though.
[03:55.11]This is a DLC?
[03:56.17]No, it's not!
[03:57.25]No, it's not, because I... Listen to me.
[03:59.13]I downloaded Dead Rising 2.
[04:01.01]This is a separate purchase on Steam.
[04:03.88]It's a separate video game.
[04:05.18]I made that mistake.
[04:08.96]This is not a DLC for Dead Rising 2.
[04:11.28]This is a full standalone video game.
[04:13.84]Dead Rising 2 again.
[04:24.64]He bought the wrong one.
[04:25.84]No, this is the right one.
[04:26.74]Because I want to use the camera too.
[04:28.08]And we're playing with Frank.
[04:31.91]Still no options menu, by the way.
[04:40.15]This is Dead Rising 2 too.
[04:48.50]So what I could do... I was thinking about doing both anyways.
[04:52.80]Going back and playing as Chuck.
[04:53.82]Chuck.
[04:59.30]This is why, like, constant conflict in this chat.
[05:02.36]I may as well open up a Barbie game after talking about all this.
[05:09.74]Do a poll?
[05:10.50]I did three of them before the stream started.
[05:13.48]Unanimously, it was this game.
[05:15.26]We're going.
[05:16.04]Don't care.
[05:22.28]Like, it was 80%- it was like 75%.
[05:23.64]I clawed my way out of Willamette.
[05:28.58]I fought hard to uncover the truth of what happened at that mall.
[05:33.40]This is really loud.
[05:39.45]Turn your speakers down for a few minutes, because I can't alt-tab.
[05:46.59]Things were good.
[05:48.47]Real good.
[05:51.49]If only there was an option.
[05:55.57]For a while.
[06:03.53]Then, I'll let things get to me.
[06:07.15]I'll let things get out of control.
[06:10.03]Dead Rising 2, the original, has options.
[06:14.35]Are you fucking kidding me?
[06:15.89]How is it possible to have this?
[06:19.04]I think deep down, I knew I hadn't uncovered what was really going on.
[06:49.05]Fighting never ends.
[06:50.89]This is a fight.
[06:56.00]I'm like dad at the dinner table while the whole family argues.
[06:59.88]Then I got a huge family.
[07:04.24]I'm at the very end of the table just slowly cutting my steak.
[07:06.98]And I hear people yelling about their days and screaming at each other about what's better.
[07:11.05]And I'm just like, God damn it.
[07:12.53]How do I keep this fucking family together?
[07:15.07]And I just take a bite.
[07:23.56]Excuse me, sir.
[07:46.61]What is it, kid?
[07:49.05]I signed your waiver.
[07:50.57]You got my next of kin.
[07:52.60]Are the vultures circling already?
[07:53.76]Alright, everybody's settled out.
[07:55.74]Everybody's settled out.
[07:56.74]Yeah, sorry, sir.
[07:57.98]It's just paperwork.
[07:59.34]They want it from everyone.
[08:00.48]Oh, I've lost control.
[08:02.06]Would you mind if I got your autograph?
[08:07.61]This spoils two.
[08:09.53]But this is two.
[08:12.13]Isn't it?
[08:12.73]Isn't it the same game?
[08:14.59]Sorry about that.
[08:15.35]What's going on?
[08:17.46]Everybody sit up!
[08:18.36]It's been a while.
[08:19.12]Eat your peas, Jeffrey!
[08:20.42]You've always been a big hero, Mr. West.
[08:22.73]I was really bummed when your show went off the air.
[08:27.55]Wow, thanks.
[08:30.05]So I guess this would be worth quite a bit if anything happened to you out there tonight.
[08:33.80]Uh, yeah.
[08:37.14]I guess so.
[08:39.04]Good luck out there.
[08:41.82]Maybe this wasn't such a bad idea after all.
[08:48.57]No, I'm not.
[08:49.79]I'm the DLC killer!
[08:51.03]Get it right!
[09:16.01]Now we in for a show.
[09:18.65]A rematch of all rematches.
[09:22.23]Now Frank's gotta kill zombies to earn cash.
[09:25.85]Bigger than death, bigger than payoff.
[09:29.31]Especially if you use those corner grinders.
[09:33.62]I do like a good grinding.
[09:37.56]But first, TK has got a personal message just for you, Frank West.
[09:44.26]You gotta be willing to risk it all if you're ever really gonna win!
[09:53.05]It's okay.
[09:57.84]So loud!
[09:59.58]Okay.
[10:01.20]Hi, guys.
[10:02.40]Alright, boys and girls, let's get it on!
[10:06.46]Okay.
[10:07.26]Kill zombies, win money.
[10:09.67]You got it.
[10:10.45]Stop.
[10:11.29]Stop.
[10:12.71]Oh.
[10:14.26]It would have been really nice if this was available.
[10:16.62]Fuckin' DLC game.
[10:24.61]Can you guys hear me?
[10:28.67]God, I'm back.
[10:37.80]Subtitles, it's fine.
[10:39.18]Uh, nope.
[10:40.64]Nope.
[10:46.81]PC settings.
[10:47.95]That's alright.
[10:48.91]Controller.
[10:49.45]Yes.
[10:51.37]Blur effects.
[10:52.35]No.
[10:53.23]High.
[10:54.07]High.
[10:55.57]4x.
[10:57.23]Save those changes.
[10:59.11]Keep these changes.
[11:00.03]Yes.
[11:02.25]It's at 60Hz right now?
[11:03.71]Oh, give me a break.
[11:04.71]Why did it... Is it visual?
[11:09.23]PC settings?
[11:12.16]Uh-oh.
[11:13.50]If this crashes the game, I'm going to put a halt for my monitor and I'm ending the stream.
[11:26.76]Okay, we're good.
[11:32.22]Alright, you ready?
[11:39.95]Let's go!
[11:43.47]Why am I not playing two?
[11:48.81]Because there was a huge fight at the dinner table before the stream started.
[11:51.86]And, like, 70% of the people told me to play this one.
[11:55.36]So, make- clip that!
[11:56.66]And everybody- and- clip that fucking thing I just said!
[12:00.16]And if anybody asks!
[12:01.21]Oh shit!
[12:31.05]They were wrong.
[12:31.85]I don't know, man.
[12:33.55]I haven't played these games before.
[12:37.25]I thought... I was under the impression that this was... They, like, redid 2.
[12:40.79]It made it with another character.
[12:41.79]It added features.
[12:42.69]This is 2 again, but it's not the same.
[12:44.14]Everybody hates Chuck.
[12:45.36]Nobody likes Chuck.
[12:46.58]I don't even know who that is.
[12:47.64]They just don't like that person.
[12:55.72]Jump on the corners.
[13:01.74]Oops, I wasn't looking.
[13:05.22]Alright, I wanna do more grind.
[13:11.15]Wait, I gotta get as many people up here as I can.
[13:18.01]Let's go!
[13:18.25]Grind him up.
[13:21.09]Oh, the fire comes out.
[13:22.21]Right.
[13:24.81]Almost at 15.
[13:28.40]I'm waiting for my shot.
[13:31.05]Look, I'll probably, I'll like speedrun the fucking first game, okay?
[13:44.54]No, jump off.
[13:46.90]God damn it.
[13:47.42]25,000?
[13:50.12]I don't think so.
[14:05.50]3,000 4,000 5,000 25,000 That to be in the ring
[14:33.07]I gotta be in the ring, gotta be in the ring, gotta be in the ring!
[14:34.65]Somebody get in the ring!
[14:36.57]No!
[14:53.56]Let me hear it, people!
[14:57.88]I love you, TK!
[15:00.06]I turned the volume down!
[15:02.26]Though I did expect a little bit more from our celebrity zombie killer.
[15:08.51]But we have been started!
[15:11.03]Every cutscene is pre-rendered and pre-loaded.
[15:13.85]And there's nothing you can do about it.
[15:19.28]Every cutscene is pre-rendered, pre-loud!
[15:24.39]I'm so- I said every cutscene is fucking pre-rendered and pre-loud and you can't do anything about it.
[15:34.50]Use volume mixer in Windows?
[15:35.88]I have to- I have to- I have to alt-tab and the game fucking breaks if you alt-tab.
[15:40.88]Video games suck, okay?
[15:43.22]Can we just be very clear?
[15:46.77]These things have been held together with, like, Elmer's glue.
[15:50.01]Especially on PC, like, ten years ago.
[15:51.11]Let our government know we will not stand for their systematic neglect of the infected!
[15:54.32]We must take drastic action now!
[16:10.74]Public opinion is mixed on the group's views, which are sometimes seen as radical.
[16:14.56]This is a joke, right?
[16:15.77]Why would you want to save those things?
[16:19.23]Stay tuned.
[16:19.93]Coming up right after the break, we've got weather and sports.
[16:27.67]I can't believe I just did that.
[16:30.67]I feel like such a sellout.
[16:46.21]Hey, do you know how I can get the hell out of here?
[16:49.66]Yeah, take the elevator up a floor and then straight down the hallway.
[16:52.96]You can't miss it.
[16:56.58]Alright, now imagine my shock when I put a poll in chat that has three or four hundred votes on it.
[17:04.65]And 70% of those people say this is the one you should play.
[17:08.37]Now imagine my shock when I turn the stream on and in comes the flood of people that say that it was completely wrong.
[17:15.94]It was like 70%.
[17:18.76]What about the other 3,000 bucks?
[17:22.92]Imagine my fucking shock.
[17:45.59]I did a pull three times.
[17:47.33]It's over.
[17:48.37]You want to talk about not canon stories?
[17:51.69]Here's a not canon story for you.
[18:12.20]Here's some non-canon for you.
[18:29.21]How could this be different?
[18:31.07]It's the same audience.
[18:33.92]What?
[18:38.42]You guys are doing this just out of spite right now.
[18:45.51]Even still for... God damn it.
[18:47.48]Is he fatter?
[19:01.26]Frank wants to use the guide arrow to find a way to the exit.
[19:03.44]The guide arrow will always point towards Frank's current objective.
[19:15.85]No, the mistake I made was playing a game that's more than 10 years old that has a lot of fans.
[19:21.02]That's the biggest mistake of all.
[19:39.50]Sixty percent.
[19:40.44]How many of those people did that just to be a dick?
[19:42.72]I wonder.
[19:45.20]We're doing this.
[19:46.49]We're doing this because I'm already here, and I already set up the stupid emulator to use the controller.
[19:51.73]I'm gonna go back, you know, just to spite everything, I'm gonna play through to, again, as Chuck.
[19:59.14]When I'm done with this.
[20:12.22]Alright, save a game, visit a bathroom.
[20:13.38]You can save as often as you'd like, and it's a good idea to do so.
[20:19.92]Find the closest bathroom by looking for the save icon on the map.
[20:22.78]Okay.
[20:31.36]Imagine if I just walked away from it.
[20:34.85]Okay, me and Frank have the same body.
[20:37.48]That's, I mean, at least ass-wise.
[20:39.82]Yes, I did just say that.
[20:41.08]You know, it's all out the window at this point.
[20:42.44]Who cares?
[20:50.93]God damn it.
[20:58.57]Alright.
[20:59.67]Let's go.
[21:04.25]You're sure this is gonna help, right?
[21:06.29]Oh, sure.
[21:28.95]Non-canon spoilers.
[21:42.70]Frank West is back!
[21:44.26]Complete with his photojournalistic skills.
[21:46.34]Ready the camera by holding down left trigger, yeah.
[21:48.79]And tapping right bumper.
[21:50.11]Release left trigger to put the camera away.
[21:53.13]Erotica, horror, outtake, drama, and brutality.
[21:57.81]That's from the last one, right?
[22:00.09]Take photos when you see the yellow PP icons.
[22:02.34]They will net you even more PP.
[22:06.28]Lock in your favorite pictures in the picture viewer.
[22:07.98]Yeah, I remember that.
[22:10.26]New photos automatically overwrite unlocked photos.
[22:13.64]Mm-hmm.
[22:19.37]Ready camera by holding LT and tapping right bumper.
[22:23.47]Right.
[22:25.93]I'm supposed to take a...
[22:29.94]Got you.
[22:36.18]What is that?
[22:36.64]Got it.
[22:44.37]Alright.
[22:50.47]I got what I needed.
[22:52.83]That's TK and Brandon.
[22:58.46]Don't look.
[22:58.94]That's a...
[23:04.76]Special, special.
[23:12.01]Better angle up here.
[23:13.27]Is that a bomb?
[23:25.58]I still don't understand exactly your part, you know?
[23:30.44]Little man, you got to trust that DK got some very good reasons.
[23:35.30]Just a bit nervous, you know?
[23:39.24]Dead Rising 2 spoils off the record.
[23:46.46]Now you just take this.
[23:47.98]A little compensation for your trouble.
[23:54.16]Got him.
[23:54.68]We're doing a... Alright.
[24:01.63]I got the briefcase switch.
[24:06.77]How could they ignore me doing this?
[24:12.72]Not good.
[24:13.06]I gotta zoom in.
[24:16.74]Jump down to get a better shot?
[24:18.06]I don't think I can jump down.
[24:22.64]Got it.
[24:25.78]You're playing for Super Mario 2 as Luigi.
[24:29.44]Oh, alright.
[24:30.72]I'm alright with that.
[24:31.74]Well, well, well.
[24:32.66]Lookie here, Frank West.
[24:38.76]Hey, fanboys.
[24:51.60]You're a little late for the autographs.
[24:55.08]I was just looking for the men's room.
[24:57.29]Story of my life.
[24:58.63]Nah, I think we showed up rather than Nicatana.
[25:05.13]Dude, this is so funny.
[25:08.97]Done now, boy.
[25:09.79]Oh, hell no.
[25:17.82]Is it like a dodge roll or something?
[25:18.91]Is that a run?
[25:20.67]He just spit on me.
[25:22.17]I know that technique from the last game.
[25:24.15]This guy's the same size.
[25:29.41]I'm dead.
[25:50.09]Wait, it's scripted!
[25:51.70]It's scripted!
[25:52.36]Who is that?
[26:21.81]Chuck is a man of God and doesn't have scenes like this.
[26:26.73]Dude, I'm sorry, the stream pre-orders.
[26:35.95]Had me thinking a completely different thing.
[26:49.37]This is a sex game.
[27:05.62]There's a 45 minute long sex scene Imagine how imagine trying to get that into a game It would never happen
[27:41.31]Uh-oh.
[27:43.17]It's unskippable.
[27:44.77]Got to get one.
[28:06.73]Hara, hara, hara, hara, hara.
[28:10.17]Oh, Tom!
[28:10.77]Terry!
[28:14.61]That was quick.
[28:20.73]Alice is dead.
[28:21.51]Well, I can't save her, buddy.
[28:25.19]Alright.
[28:25.67]Well, let's go.
[28:27.93]Anything in here?
[28:40.93]Not saving anybody.
[28:41.87]Omega lull.
[28:42.61]You can't!
[28:44.61]Alright, fire action.
[28:45.35]No, keep the fire action.
[28:51.13]He's so red.
[28:59.30]This actually kind of looks stupid.
[29:06.35]Why?
[29:06.67]How did I get on my back?
[29:22.60]Go in here.
[29:23.78]This is no place for a kid.
[29:29.65]Yep.
[29:32.89]Spoon.
[29:35.45]That's pretty good.
[29:38.24]No, what are you doing?
[29:44.13]Take off those shoes now.
[29:46.25]This first second I'm able to, the shoes are coming off.
[29:49.85]Anything else in here?
[29:51.15]No, let's go.
[30:07.56]Is there this throwing in this game, right?
[30:12.22]Dale!
[30:13.96]Dale's dead.
[30:16.47]I just triple tapped that guy.
[30:18.95]Is this money on the ground?
[30:21.79]Wait, what is this?
[30:22.51]Keys?
[30:23.07]Security box?
[30:29.57]Wait!
[30:29.87]Jeremiah!
[30:43.41]How'd he die?
[30:44.07]What?
[30:45.11]Did he, like, run his head into a spike?
[30:46.91]Alright, I'm coming to think that you can't actually do anything.
[30:55.14]Pat and Lucas!
[30:55.98]They just keep coming, I can't do anything about it.
[30:59.00]Oh, fuck!
[31:00.07]Oh my god.
[31:18.41]Andrea, can I do anything?
[31:19.47]Why are there grenades everywhere?
[31:31.40]Don't use grenades in close proximity, guys.
[31:49.74]Can we have five community subs coming from Cassie?
[31:53.90]Which one of these is Chuck?
[32:07.64]This is Chuck.
[32:24.74]Alright, get in the safe house.
[32:27.64]Chuck!
[32:44.04]Do I make it into the elevator?
[32:45.12]We'll find out.
[32:53.63]Sort of jogged right in.
[33:03.09]Time to break the bank, Vegas style.
[33:05.15]The other end, this is Vegas.
[33:14.48]I can't get a signal.
[33:15.68]Why?
[33:16.70]Why can't I get a signal?
[33:19.21]It's because you don't have Verizon.
[33:20.33]She was looking right at me and they had her and I couldn't do anything.
[33:23.57]She went down without a sound and I had to get out of there.
[33:26.66]I just ran.
[33:44.46]He does look like Dan Aykroyd.
[33:49.18]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[33:51.04]Don't I know you?
[33:52.27]Could be.
[33:53.65]Name's Frank.
[33:55.55]Frank West.
[33:58.65]Oh, you're the big shot from Willamette.
[34:01.57]Yeah, I am.
[34:03.27]I seen you on TV.
[34:05.49]They don't take this the wrong way.
[34:07.73]But ain't you infected?
[34:09.98]Hey, don't worry.
[34:13.12]It's under control.
[34:14.78]Zombrex.
[34:15.80]You better have three days worth, pal.
[34:18.36]You seem real nice.
[34:19.80]I'd hate to have to put a bullet in your head.
[34:24.05]Uh, thanks.
[34:25.75]We ain't got any Zombrex here.
[34:29.34]Military have to quarantine first.
[34:31.60]They'll enter the city at first light three days from now to get all of us.
[34:35.02]That's the standard procedure.
[34:39.36]So we're stuck here.
[34:40.90]Where is he keeping that Zombrex?
[34:42.52]Probably down the front of his pants.
[35:07.06]Damn it.
[35:07.40]I'm already out of coffee.
[35:08.48]What a disaster.
[35:09.24]Orange juice.
[35:24.82]I'm already seeing it.
[35:29.46]Didn't he just say we don't have any Zombrex?
[35:31.12]I know where you can get some.
[35:34.56]What are you talking about?
[35:35.98]Zombrex.
[35:37.84]Don't worry.
[35:38.42]I won't see you.
[35:41.54]I know who you are.
[35:42.30]I figured you were infected.
[35:45.58]Though I don't remember you saying anything about that in your book.
[35:49.92]Well, it's not exactly something I'd go around advertising.
[35:55.96]There's a pharmacy in the Royal Flesh Mall.
[35:58.63]Back to the mall.
[35:59.85]I'm Stacy Forsythe, by the way.
[36:01.92]I'm Frank.
[36:02.76]Frank West.
[36:04.46]Plenty of people know you.
[36:05.54]Do you know a way out of here?
[36:09.58]No.
[36:10.48]But if you find one, I suggest you take this.
[36:14.61]That way we can keep in touch.
[36:19.88]There's closed circuit cameras all over the city.
[36:22.64]These monitors are playback only.
[36:24.84]But I'll keep an eye out.
[36:25.77]Bluetooth headset.
[36:27.59]Those must have just come out, right?
[36:29.01]Hello?
[36:46.88]Okay, got the map.
[36:48.02]Find Zombrex.
[36:49.10]Here we go.
[36:49.96]You've just reached a checkpoint.
[36:51.28]These occur throughout Fortune City.
[36:53.36]Whenever you see checkpoint reached, you have reached a checkpoint.
[36:58.57]Right.
[36:59.59]Save often.
[37:00.13]If you quit your current game or power off, you will lose your checkpoint.
[37:03.37]Okay.
[37:08.14]Okay.
[37:10.75]The military will arrive in three days to contain the zombie outbreak.
[37:14.27]Of course.
[37:15.43]Keep track of how much time is left.
[37:16.85]Press the select to check the watch, right?
[37:20.79]Always remember that Frank needs Zombrex every 24 hours.
[37:24.93]Oh, shit.
[37:27.35]The transceiver will let you receive co-op calls.
[37:30.74]Well, we're not going to be doing that.
[37:32.82]People can drop in for a co-op game at any time.
[37:35.14]You can restrict who joins in the gameplay options.
[37:39.09]Explore Fortune City with a friend and slaughter even more undead.
[37:43.37]Me and Star played this, like, five years ago.
[37:47.67]But we only made it about an hour or two into the game, I think.
[37:54.09]Alright, so.
[37:54.55]Where are we at?
[37:59.17]I should check out Roy's Mart in Royal Flush Plaza.
[38:03.36]Right.
[38:04.08]That's the destination.
[38:05.04]I've got until 8 a.m.
[38:10.66]You got it.
[38:11.20]How do I put up the watch?
[38:20.50]8 a.m.
[38:20.60]Eastern Time?
[38:21.28]Sounds like it.
[38:21.92]Alright, give me this flashlight.
[38:26.55]Just give me a pallet.
[38:28.17]No, give me a piece of wood.
[38:29.47]Alright, how do I throw?
[38:39.23]What's the throw object?
[38:40.35]It's not right trigger.
[38:43.51]Left bumper?
[38:43.97]Right bumper?
[38:45.70]Right trigger?
[38:46.18]How do you throw?
[38:54.57]Alright, fuck it.
[38:54.97]Who cares.
[38:56.83]You can't throw inside the safe.
[38:58.03]Right, right, right.
[39:06.74]How many save slots do I get?
[39:07.88]I have to be really careful then.
[39:10.98]I have... I get three slots.
[39:18.23]I had like ten in Dead Rising.
[39:19.93]At least six, right?
[39:20.85]I remember being down here and just throwing shit at each other.
[39:39.08]You get 12 slots in original Dead Rising 2.
[39:41.22]Sounds like a much better game.
[39:43.50]Alright.
[40:06.73]Zombrex.
[40:08.96]So, I need to go to here.
[40:10.78]So, we go straight out, bang a left.
[40:13.44]Just make our way over there, I guess.
[40:14.52]I got nothing else to do.
[40:15.24]Is it that?
[40:19.40]Okay, it's... There it is.
[40:23.15]Saw blades.
[40:24.87]Uh, what's in the box?
[40:28.09]Just more saws.
[40:29.11]Do they stack in this game?
[40:30.29]No, they don't.
[40:30.99]Alright, let's go.
[40:34.98]Ooh, there's a shovel, though.
[40:35.94]I'm gonna replace flashlight with, no, handbag with shovel.
[40:40.33]That's much.
[40:40.69]Does it have a super punch?
[40:42.25]Yep.
[40:46.07]How do I bring up the watch?
[40:47.34]Wasn't it left on the D-pad?
[40:55.18]Stacey will send you messages about the interesting things she sees happening around Fortune City.
[41:01.18]Each mission has a time limit.
[41:02.56]You can track the time limits on the mission queue on the HUD or in the watch screen.
[41:08.46]Messages will lead you to survivors of the zombie outbreak scattered around the city.
[41:11.72]Yes, they will.
[41:12.56]And that's urgent.
[41:13.80]Blast.
[41:27.37]Things that I don't say on a... There's slot machines in this game.
[41:33.22]Welcome to Fortune City where money is king.
[41:34.90]People come to Fortune City to win big.
[41:37.04]You'll never know when you'll need some money.
[41:40.00]Smashing ATMs and slot machines can earn you easy money.
[41:42.84]Earn even more by playing winning slot machines.
[41:47.65]Collect gambling magazines for a lucky boost.
[41:52.49]Look out for money cases and security box keys.
[41:54.85]They can lead you to big cash rewards if you see one.
[41:57.07]Grab it.
[42:00.75]So there's money in this game.
[42:04.56]Okay, what is it?
[42:05.58]I have like two of these.
[42:07.84]Can I see how many of these I have?
[42:10.58]Alright, let's do it.
[42:16.32]Shoes?
[42:17.28]Off.
[42:17.96]In the closet?
[42:19.22]This is my favorite place to be.
[42:22.44]Alright, what's that, uh... Brick?
[42:25.62]There's bricks in this game.
[42:38.56]I want a brick.
[42:39.86]You can throw bricks?
[42:40.82]Yeah, I think I've had the same reaction.
[42:44.18]What a pathetic throw.
[42:48.43]He threw that like it weighed ten times more than it does.
[42:58.28]I have to hit somebody in the face with this.
[43:06.09]Got it.
[43:06.33]Okay, I can move on.
[43:09.27]What else is in here?
[43:12.97]Vinyl records.
[43:14.09]Large soda.
[43:16.18]Register.
[43:17.08]Smash the register.
[43:25.87]Wow, you actually do collect money.
[43:28.97]Gun.
[43:34.33]Get the foam finger.
[43:35.59]Red spray paint.
[43:39.65]I need a big aim.
[43:40.29]Okay, I gotta go.
[43:43.32]How do guns work in this game?
[43:44.48]Are they just as horrible?
[43:47.84]They're pretty good.
[43:48.36]They're not bad.
[43:55.71]Let's go find... Let's just do this, because I'm... Alright, I'm here.
[44:02.53]You can walk and aim?
[44:05.99]Oh, fuck.
[44:17.15]You can walk?
[44:19.37]And aim?
[44:19.69]What's that?
[44:20.35]Sporting goods store?
[44:25.95]Come on.
[44:26.33]It's MY turn!
[44:41.62]What?
[44:42.60]I need the hammer?

[44:47.84]They're MMA gloves, alright.
[44:50.82]Okay, I'm gonna get- I'm gonna use the MMA gloves.
[44:56.94]Boxing gloves?
[45:03.75]Do I get experience for this?
[45:25.50]Holy shit, I actually did.
[45:34.85]Thousand?
[45:37.85]Come on, break.
[45:48.76]Two completely different recorded voice lines for the same thing.
[45:53.11]That's Spider-Man PS4 levels of awesome.
[45:57.94]OJ?
[45:58.64]Alright, get out of my way.
[46:01.79]Orange juice is way better than soda.
[46:07.41]The truck only has three recorded voice lines?
[46:25.32]Does it only have one?
[46:26.14]That kinda sucks.
[46:36.10]It's a giant craps table.
[46:43.91]This game is cool.
[46:44.83]Can I actually do this?
[46:46.19]Can I actually play craps?
[46:48.13]Come on!
[46:55.30]What do I get?
[46:57.16]Four!
[46:57.50]I have to bet.
[46:59.28]How do I bet?
[47:04.33]I gotta put a bet down.
[47:14.01]Oh shit!
[47:14.87]That's outside of the playing area.
[47:16.25]I have to go get chips?
[47:23.92]Okay, I'm gonna get addicted to some stuff in here.
[47:25.88]It's gonna be crazy.
[47:32.05]I like the feedback on that gun.
[47:39.49]We got jewelry store.

[47:41.84]Gems.
[47:45.42]Can I just like convert this into money?

[47:56.24]Get off me, you motherfucker.
[47:58.27]Shopping boxes.
[48:03.83]Alright.
[48:04.65]I don't want to run out of time.
[48:09.73]There's a car in the mall.
[48:11.19]And this is a drivable car?
[48:13.89]In the mall?
[48:16.63]They're already... Oh, come on.
[48:20.97]I need...
[48:27.08]Shit, it exists.
[48:28.55]It actually exists.

[48:38.19]Alright, I'm done.
[48:50.29]Oh god, he's addicted?
[48:51.09]I just won 1200 dollars and got up and walked away.
[49:03.74]Going over here.
[49:04.68]Am I going the right way?
[49:05.98]Uh, yes, it's right here.
[49:14.04]You sprayed on yourself first.
[49:21.74]I want some more, I want some more coffee.
[49:23.88]Shit.
[49:24.20]I just got like a little one.
[49:31.64]Fantastic.
[49:36.11]Hey!
[49:39.85]I know you're holding out on us.
[49:41.41]Where's the money?
[49:42.63]Where's the safe?
[49:45.09]Come on!
[49:46.59]Don't lie to me!
[49:47.69]We don't have a safe!
[49:50.16]Don't lie!
[49:51.28]Hey, don't you have something better to do?
[49:54.92]Why don't you mind your own business, old man?
[49:58.30]Just looking for some meds.
[50:00.12]No need to get ugly.
[50:01.85]Well, you're definitely going to need some painkillers when I'm done with you.
[50:06.48]Well, talking to you is giving me a headache.
[50:08.72]Crowbar is not a great weapon.
[50:10.52]Hard to swing.
[50:12.10]It's heavy.
[50:13.18]Give us some money, Grandpa.
[50:17.04]We'll help you out.
[50:18.16]How about it, Grandpa?
[50:20.22]You got any money?
[50:22.02]No, just a block of wood.
[50:26.14]It's actually... Do you know how heavy a crowbar actually is?
[50:29.80]Oh!
[50:35.66]In a turn you find friends green.
[50:38.04]Completely green.
[50:41.80]Wait, what did... Why did I call me Grandpa?
[50:49.61]I'm like... 41.
[50:51.41]Alright, I've had enough.
[51:08.46]I thought he was gonna drink it!
[51:09.42]I thought he was gonna drink it!
[51:10.36]I was gonna let him take a sip!
[51:11.52]It's a psycho!
[51:28.19]Well, I was gonna let him get a nice swig before he died.
[51:30.79]Mmm!
[51:39.35]Alright, crowbar, double crowbar, and hatchet.
[51:45.87]Oh, shit, you're alive.
[51:46.75]Alright, hold on.
[51:48.69]Do you mind if I take all this?
[51:49.67]Okay.
[51:58.32]I thought they were gonna kill me!
[52:01.04]It's okay, you're safe now.
[52:01.94]Are you hurt?
[52:02.36]I think I'm okay.
[52:05.06]Thank you so much.
[52:05.62]You got here before they... before they...
[52:09.66]Listen, there's a safe house where you'll be safe.
[52:11.94]Follow me and I'll take you there.
[52:18.53]Dents?
[52:19.33]Is it Denise?
[52:20.55]Dents.
[52:22.59]There are survivors of the outbreak scattered throughout Fortune City.
[52:26.63]Escort anyone you find back to the safe house.
[52:29.73]Though some might not come with you willingly.
[52:32.05]Y is to call a survivor, or you can press left trigger and Y to send them to a location, right?
[52:38.25]Yes, yes, yes, okay.
[52:41.06]Let's get a Zombrex.
[52:47.49]Anybody else here?
[52:51.05]Zombrex!
[52:54.31]Frank will need a Zombrex at 8 a.m.
[52:57.41]It is high in demand, expensive, and hard to find.
[53:01.57]The new and improved Zombrex formula lasts 24 hours.
[53:04.49]Zombrex overdoses are deadly.
[53:07.96]Oh, no.
[53:08.80]Users must never take it earlier than prescribed.
[53:16.84]I'm gonna have to save all the time.
[53:19.00]The Zombrex counter on your HUD shows how much you have at all times.
[53:23.42]Frank needs Zombrex every day between 7 a.m.
[53:26.12]and 8 a.m.
[53:26.89]If he doesn't get it, he will die.
[53:29.65]So, every day at 7 a.m.
[53:31.31]to 8 a.m., just scream at me.
[53:34.27]Check your watch to see if it's time for your next dose.
[53:41.56]Okay.
[53:43.94]I have Zombrex.
[53:44.68]It's too early to inject myself.
[53:46.14]I can only inject myself between 7 and 8 a.m.
[53:53.86]Give me that orange juice.
[53:57.30]Uh... Oh, I remember the computer!
[53:59.82]The computer joke.
[54:01.32]It's all coming back to me.
[54:02.80]A Defib!
[54:09.43]You alive?
[54:11.57]Now you're extra alive.
[54:12.45]Alright, let's go.
[54:16.85]Oh, there's orange juice everywhere, but I don't really need it.
[54:21.77]Actually, you know what?
[54:22.37]Yeah, I'm going to take another one.
[54:24.03]Let's go.
[54:30.38]So, I need to take that Zombrex.
[54:32.66]Actually, I should... Can you have a weapon?
[54:37.36]Here, come here.
[54:39.20]Give item.
[54:41.08]Here, I mean, you're the doctor, so you take this.
[54:44.70]What?
[54:45.94]You're the doctor!
[54:51.89]You'll take an axe, but you won't take a defib?
[54:53.87]Alright.
[54:58.53]Okay.
[55:00.07]Guide arrow.
[55:00.87]I need to go back to the safe house.
[55:06.95]Is it already guiding me or is this just I have to take his own bricks at 7 a.m.
[55:15.42]I Swing my swing dance Holy shit that she's actually attacking zombies Alright, um, where's the safe house from here?
[55:34.04]Can I not move around?
[55:34.80]There we go.
[55:35.96]So, uh, the safe house is... What is it?
[55:39.66]It's the green one?
[55:42.36]Can I zoom out a little bit?
[55:44.24]It was back here, wasn't it?
[55:47.75]Alright.
[55:48.19]Gonna set a waypoint to here.
[55:49.25]Let's go back to the safe house.
[55:59.39]You alright?
[56:00.81]Alright, let's move.
[56:01.41]We gotta go.
[56:13.36]The bare feet can be accessed through the locker in the safe house.
[56:15.74]I love how that's being spammed.
[56:18.10]Jeremy, bare feet.
[56:19.12]Is that available?
[56:20.24]Bare feet available.
[56:21.24]Keep up!
[56:41.96]I feel like a superhero from Mystery Men.
[56:46.88]I'm the defense!
[56:48.12]But he's a wrestler.
[56:48.98]Alright.
[56:50.79]Come on, come on, come on!
[57:03.19]Yeah, this is one of the people that they passed on during that whole montage where they're trying to find superheroes.
[57:09.94]Like Deadpool 2, pick one.
[57:11.40]Hey, I'm waiting on you!
[57:26.52]Yeah, Deadpool 2 for zoomers, Mystery Men for boomers.
[57:30.26]I can make sure that I address all audiences.
[57:33.78]She's like dead.
[57:49.64]Don't die, I can't lose the first survivor.
[57:56.19]Right through there.
[58:00.69]Maybe get an actual weapon.
[58:05.26]I'm fine.
[58:07.62]Don't die, don't die, don't die!
[58:09.52]I thought she just had a giant syringe for a second.
[58:29.26]Did somebody just say MonkaSBearFeet?
[58:34.31]Why is that?
[58:37.07]Firecrackers!
[58:37.91]Dance, look!
[58:47.97]He's moving!
[58:55.32]He's coming!
[59:02.46]Those guys were stealing everything.
[59:03.50]Thanks for saving my life.
[59:10.48]Okay.
[59:10.96]Where can I change into bare feet around here?
[59:13.44]The fuck are you talking about, Frank?
[59:32.93]Just take off your damn shoes and socks.
[59:34.91]What are you talking about?
[59:37.42]Earned PP by killing zombies.
[59:38.88]Yep, yep, yep, yep.
[59:39.62]Let's you level up.
[59:40.22]Yep, leveling up, up, up, up.
[59:41.50]Let's you gain new skills, attributes, and even combo cards.
[59:43.76]Yes, it does.
[59:49.83]New skill.
[59:50.99]Roundhouse kick.
[59:52.49]Hold right trigger and hold A.
[60:07.56]real bucket?
[60:08.22]Wait, what do you mean combo cards?
[60:13.91]Pylon and spray paint is a bullhorn.
[60:24.69]Okay.
[60:25.52]Uh, status.
[60:28.78]Skills.
[60:29.78]Jump kick, yeah.
[60:31.56]Dodge roll, click left stick.
[60:33.28]Good to know.
[60:33.98]Roundhouse.
[60:36.74]Hold right trigger and hold A. Alright, so, what's the problem?
[60:41.40]Hold right trigger and hold A. I'm in the safe house, never mind.
[60:49.87]Alright, so, um... What time is it?
[60:53.39]I gotta inject myself?
[60:56.45]It is 6.17 AM.
[60:57.09]I have to take an injection in like 15 minutes.
[61:13.44]This is fine.
[61:14.08]Safe house.
[61:14.38]Fine.
[61:20.13]Just chillin' before an injection.
[61:21.63]That's right.
[61:23.09]Alright, what is that?
[61:24.03]Which one is it?
[61:24.41]This one here?
[61:25.51]The locker?
[61:33.77]Hmm.
[61:44.96]I can just put on, like, tap shoes.
[61:46.68]Oh, whatever.
[61:59.07]Alright, time check.
[62:00.11]It is 6.30.
[62:00.71]Time to take an injection in a few minutes.
[62:03.63]Just go in here.
[62:04.37]There's probably a cutscene here after as well.
[62:09.85]Glad you found some Zombrex, but it's not time to take it yet.
[62:15.58]I need my daily dose between 7 and 8 a.m.
[62:17.56]I'll take it then.
[62:19.22]Can you take this anywhere?
[62:24.33]Hello?
[62:29.49]Can you hear me?
[62:31.85]Can anyone hear me?
[62:33.59]Hello?
[62:35.21]Somebody?
[62:36.51]Somebody?
[62:38.15]Don't run with scissors.
[62:39.30]It's a zombie outbreak.
[62:41.16]Alright, 6.35 a.m.
[62:46.82]I'll give you the fire extinguisher, too.
[62:50.88]And... Okay, cool.
[62:53.40]Hey, is the Star Wars game any good?
[62:56.54]Anyone, like, know anything about it?
[62:57.48]The one that's just coming out, like, in three days.
[63:05.36]Four days, whatever it is.
[63:06.16]Is it good?
[63:07.52]Anybody know?
[63:15.05]That's a lot of orange juice.
[63:20.00]Alright, a few minutes, I can take it.
[63:24.51]How the fuck are we supposed to know?
[63:28.33]I don't know.
[63:29.05]Have you guys been paying attention to it?
[63:31.19]I don't know.
[63:31.73]Did anybody, like, play it?
[63:33.88]Any journalists in here?
[63:36.34]Although, you couldn't even tell me anyways, because you're probably under, like, an NDA.
[63:47.83]The previews look good.
[63:48.89]I don't know.
[63:49.27]I just know it's coming out in a few days.
[63:50.61]I don't know if the... Some games, the review copies have already been out for a while.
[63:54.49]Maybe I just didn't know if those reviews were out, or... Alright, here we go.
[64:04.93]651, incoming.
[64:07.24]Reviews come out on Thursday.
[64:08.38]Alright.
[64:08.66]653, incoming.
[64:27.37]Drama?
[64:29.35]Go do stuff?
[64:30.81]I feel like I'm going to have to be right here, right?
[64:32.57]I've only got like an hour.
[64:34.39]I'm just going.
[64:34.73]It's time to take it.
[64:45.72]They can do it anywhere.
[64:46.92]Oh, okay.
[64:51.18]It says destination safe house.
[64:55.00]Isn't that what the destination is?
[65:00.35]7 a.m.
[65:09.71]That's it okay, so now what?
[65:13.02]Start at 8 a.m.. Nothing to do now, but wait Stacey fuck
[65:32.79]Alright.
[65:33.75]Well, let's set a waypoint to... Um... Let's go out to... Is it a gas station?
[65:41.53]That's a car.
[65:44.45]Whatever, just go this way.
[65:52.61]Go out and try the sweet roundhouse kick.
[65:54.11]Yeah, the scissors suck.
[66:03.57]Just don't gamble for an hour.
[66:04.83]No, I'm just gonna go kill stuff.
[66:06.79]And go find some more costume stuff.
[66:15.66]Okay.
[66:17.02]Well, I can... Hey!
[66:24.27]I can take you right now!
[66:27.52]Lady, it's Sandra at Dawkins, and hell no.
[66:29.90]I ain't alright.
[66:30.78]My good-for-nothing husband left me out here.
[66:32.68]I remember this part.
[66:35.54]Don't you have to... Okay.
[66:37.23]I've played the first couple hours of this game.
[66:39.69]Okay.
[66:45.33]Watch out behind you.
[66:46.95]Watch out behind you.
[66:47.48]Watch out behind you.
[66:48.02]Watch out behind you.
[66:54.48]Alright, let's go.
[66:56.70]Alright, what did she say?
[66:57.78]Oh, you got a weapon?
[67:03.17]Oh yeah, you got like a wrench.
[67:05.59]God damn it.
[67:08.09]Oh my, I'm hitting her in the head over and over again.
[67:09.95]Alright, um... I didn't... Where was it?
[67:20.85]Was it right here?
[67:21.84]It's like right here, isn't it?
[67:26.86]This is the cafe.
[67:31.64]Casual gals.
[67:34.57]Over here.
[67:35.43]Here.
[67:35.55]Take some orange juice.
[67:55.80]Here, take orange juice.
[67:57.12]I'm trying to stop.
[67:58.08]I know.
[67:59.16]You're locked in.
[67:59.92]Like aggression is taking over.
[68:01.22]Come here.
[68:02.88]No!
[68:17.61]Gordon Dawkins.
[68:18.55]There you are.
[68:21.93]Go that way.
[68:29.81]Alright.
[68:30.05]Come here, come here, come here.
[68:32.95]I hate to break up this lovely reunion, but this is not safe out here.
[68:35.09]Take this.
[68:38.35]He's right.
[68:38.67]Let's go.
[68:40.10]Yes, dear.
[68:42.12]Gordon is joined.
[68:42.68]Here, take.
[68:46.08]Drink it.
[68:48.62]Okay, you have this back.
[68:50.47]No, no, no, come back!
[68:52.01]Come back!
[68:52.71]No!
[68:54.67]Take this back!
[68:56.71]Take this back.
[68:57.69]Take this back.
[68:59.37]Yes, use that.
[69:01.29]Take it.
[69:04.93]No, I didn't want to... Okay, well, we've all been well fed.
[69:10.93]Take this.
[69:12.35]Okay, let's move.
[69:17.14]You want orange juice or what?
[69:19.56]Alright, back to the safe house.
[69:24.86]Let's go!
[69:36.03]That way, let's go.
[69:39.99]Roundhouse kick.
[69:41.39]That's a pretty shitty roundhouse kick.
[69:45.56]It's really... It's too low.
[69:57.23]Frank is my age.
[69:58.61]How old is Frank in this game?
[70:05.83]He's 50?
[70:06.74]You guys making it?
[70:11.06]Yeah.
[70:12.20]Can I have... Give me your stuff back.
[70:13.46]I want that back.
[70:19.73]Why does nobody want this?
[70:20.67]I want to throw them.
[70:29.16]It's because it sucks.
[70:33.84]Urgent.
[70:34.60]Frank, they're starting to... Alright, well, let's go back to the safe house.
[70:37.29]Two more people.
[70:50.21]It's all that we have received a broadcast from our field reporter, Rebecca Chang, who is inside Fortune City.
[70:57.26]Don't tease me like that.
[70:58.10]I wish I could drink that right now.
[70:59.26]I love shitty, dirty, coffee pot coffee.
[71:00.64]It's like my favorite thing.
[71:02.58]Rebecca, look at you.
[71:03.96]Not the weather girl anymore.
[71:17.82]Okay, this is how fucked up my brain is.
[71:21.30]I was about to, like, just send Kim a text saying, hey, could you throw on a pot of coffee for me?
[71:28.50]And I opened up Twitter and was about to write, hey, can you throw a pot of coffee on for me?
[71:32.51]The report suggests that the man in the video is a member of the protest group, Cure.
[71:37.47]Cure?
[71:38.81]Authorities speculate that Cure was attempting to discredit terror's reality or to shock Americans out of what Cure sees as their complacency.
[71:47.47]No statement of responsibility has yet been received.
[71:50.78]This horrible act of terror appears to be an escalation of violence for the protest troop.
[71:57.18]This is Rebecca Chang reporting live from the Fortune City Hotel in the heart of Fortune City.
[72:03.34]You.
[72:04.75]What the hell?
[72:06.17]That was your picture on that screen.
[72:08.43]Where the hell did that come from?
[72:10.39]Liar.
[72:10.89]It came from the security cameras, lady.
[72:14.29]What the hell were you thinking?
[72:18.03]Your group's got a reputation, but come on.
[72:21.03]Cure had nothing to do with this.
[72:23.44]It's pretty easy to say that, isn't it?
[72:26.04]But you're gonna need more than that.
[72:27.72]Better start talking.
[72:31.30]Right now.
[72:32.98]I'm telling you, we're being set up.
[72:35.12]We've been accused of things before, but we don't believe in violence.
[72:37.56]Did I just send that to the wrong fucking person?
[72:39.12]Someone's convenient excuse.
[72:40.90]No.
[72:41.00]Oh, really?
[72:41.52]I was gonna say, what is wrong with me?
[72:42.68]It's not the first time members of Cure have been falsely accused of being involved with an outbreak.
[72:48.37]Gotta find whoever leaked that tape.
[72:51.37]That damn TK and his horrible show.
[72:54.75]Like an old real estate agent or something.
[72:58.45]Hey, can you put a pot of coffee on for me?
[73:02.34]I investigate this.
[73:04.64]Maybe I get back to doing what I do best.
[73:06.56]That reporter, where is she?
[73:09.98]She said she was in the hotel.
[73:13.32]I know this could end up being a big chance for your career.
[73:16.84]It's not internet related.
[73:18.04]It's just... Video game hardware reception.
[73:27.06]Level up.
[73:28.38]New skill.
[73:29.08]Move acquired.
[73:30.44]Alright.
[73:31.71]Case 1-2 engaged.
[73:32.87]I need to find out what that Rebecca Chang knows.
[73:40.45]You got it.
[73:41.89]Would you like to save your progress?
[73:43.69]Sure I would.
[73:56.79]Dead Rising for the Switch.
[74:00.27]Pretty great, actually.
[74:01.23]You found yourself caught in the Fortune City outbreak.
[74:03.44]Track down clues to uncover the truth about what happened.
[74:06.54]Restore your name and escape from the city.
[74:09.76]Okay.
[74:11.58]Time until the military comes.
[74:13.26]72 hours, 56 minutes, 55 seconds.
[74:18.83]Ah, I leveled up.
[74:22.35]Alright, back to exploring...
[74:28.60]Alright, that's really cool.
[74:29.78]What move did I just learn?
[74:31.78]Find the reporter in the Fortune City Hotel.
[74:34.74]I need to find that reporter in the hotel lobby.
[74:38.68]Got it.
[74:39.76]But for now.
[74:40.53]But first.
[74:41.15]Front kick.
[74:41.63]Hold RT and press A. I got it.
[74:47.39]I'm good.
[74:47.83]Get out of my way.
[74:51.67]Maintenance room key acquired.
[74:57.27]Maintenance room key acquired.
[74:58.53]Promise I won't... Maintenance room key lets you access all maintenance rooms in Fortune City.
[75:02.31]Maintenance rooms will let you make powerful combo weapons.
[75:05.66]Maintenance rooms are located throughout Fortune City.
[75:07.56]Bright red doors and neon signs are easily visible from a distance.
[75:11.32]Good.
[75:13.02]A maintenance room is always within reach.
[75:14.38]Just check your maintenance room's map.
[75:16.78]They're always marked with the wrench icon.
[75:20.77]Cool.
[75:24.61]Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[75:28.30]Take it.
[75:28.54]It's yours.
[75:29.00]Thanks.
[75:37.04]Okay, so they have... Oh, they all have little things on them.
[75:40.85]There's a guy playing with slots.
[75:42.83]Okay, I don't have to read it.
[75:47.93]I'll go check on him.
[75:48.69]I'll go sit down with him and join him.
[75:53.48]Know when to fold him.
[75:59.35]I'm gonna go join this guy.
[76:03.05]So that means it can be combined.
[76:04.77]That's cool.
[76:05.95]Alright.
[76:20.60]Let's craft.
[76:22.76]Yeah, let's do it.
[76:34.68]No one to fold the slots.
[76:37.42]Spiked bat is baseball bat in box of nails.
[76:40.85]Combo cards give you the recipe to build powerful combo weapons.
[76:43.89]Cards you have found are all on the combo card screen.
[76:46.84]Killing with combo weapons gives you bonus PP.
[76:49.22]You can level up faster and kill more zombies.
[76:53.38]So that's like... I want to make that thing.
[76:55.64]That's like Barney the Dinosaur eating a bunch of rocket pops.
[76:59.87]Whatever that thing does.
[77:00.73]Explosions.
[77:01.47]Fireworks.
[77:02.25]Try building more combo weapons using items from around the city.
[77:04.47]They're easy to spot.
[77:05.33]They all have a wrench.
[77:08.29]Speaking of which, I want one of those bad.
[77:11.20]Alright, let's see what I got.
[77:13.01]Defib.
[77:14.61]Baseball bad and defib.
[77:37.71]They only combo if they blow.
[77:40.27]Oh.
[77:40.77]Alright, well, can I do anything with this?
[77:44.02]Defib and bucket.
[77:47.86]Defib and cone.
[77:52.78]How about cone and bucket?
[77:56.86]What would that make?
[77:57.82]A bigger bucket?
[77:58.63]Alright, I got my spiked bat.
[78:01.89]Wait!
[78:04.79]Wait!
[78:08.87]Ooh, a thousand.
[78:12.19]How many gallons of milk do I have in my fridge right now?
[78:14.65]I don't, like, I don't have, like, none.
[78:17.35]I don't have, like, regular milk.
[78:20.31]Regular milk gives you diarrhea.
[78:22.23]Well, it does to me.
[78:22.99]One of those looters.
[78:25.65]Okay, well, I need to... We gotta go, because...
[78:44.67]Just trying to get PP for Grace.
[78:54.55]Nice shitty weapon.
[78:56.59]They can only be combined.
[78:57.51]I'll figure out the combinations.
[79:00.91]What?
[79:02.67]Holy shit!
[79:08.38]Oh, man!
[79:09.42]They have different... Oh, that's awesome!
[79:13.60]They don't got this shit in the base game, do they?
[79:23.24]Yes, they do.
[79:23.78]I know.
[79:24.06]I know.
[79:25.62]I know.
[79:25.86]Is it a wheelchair?
[79:34.87]Wait.
[79:36.13]Funny costume stuff.
[79:37.57]Can I put it on?
[79:47.20]Kids superhero boots.
[79:57.73]This is like Santa wakes up at 3 a.m.
[79:59.97]to drink milk out of the fridge.
[80:07.86]Which, by the way, gross.
[80:15.16]And what's the point of having... Alright, I... This button's at the top.
[80:20.10]But what on Earth are the buttons on the back for?
[80:22.06]Is that to change, like, a diaper or something?
[80:24.83]I don't know.
[80:25.25]I've never known what that is for.
[80:31.07]This is to poo.
[80:34.67]Why would... That's disgusting.
[80:36.99]What the hell was that?
[80:46.56]Who's talking?
[80:47.12]I hear somebody talking.
[80:55.81]It's a onesie.
[80:56.97]Look at the top!
[80:58.07]It buttons all the way down to the, like, the crotch area.
[81:01.45]Holy shit, this is ridiculous.
[81:08.41]Okay.
[81:09.55]Somebody's in it!
[81:17.47]Get out of the way.
[81:20.08]Wait, this is a whole casino.
[81:22.40]Oh no, I'm never gonna get out of here.
[81:24.40]I'm never gonna be able to leave.
[81:31.99]Oh shit.
[81:36.11]Okay, I gotta find this guy.
[81:39.40]Don't play any of these machines.
[81:43.88]Ah, it's a waste of money.
[81:45.64]This roulette?
[81:46.28]Can you actually play roulette?
[81:47.88]No, you can't.
[81:53.21]Damn it, I thought I had the big one for sure.
[81:55.27]Oh, well, I'll go again.
[81:57.75]Bill.
[82:01.94]Bill, we gotta talk.
[82:06.70]Well, buddy, you doing okay?
[82:08.72]I like slots too, but you might want to wait things out in the safe house.
[82:12.93]That's a nice idea, but I got money to win back.
[82:14.95]I ain't leaving without it.
[82:17.79]Might not be the best time with all these zombies around.
[82:24.56]Hang on there, sweetie.
[82:25.72]Good things come to those who wait.
[82:29.24]You can gamble.
[82:29.70]Why don't you just break them?

[96:37.15]Yep.
[96:39.85]And special bonuses.

[97:53.68]Why is he looking at me like that with a knife out?
[97:57.08]What's he doing?
[97:57.78]What's he doing?
[98:00.92]I really love my wife, but it's like he doesn't like me at all.
[98:04.44]Can you help?
[98:08.33]Thanks, stranger.
[98:08.91]The name's Kenneth.
[98:09.95]Me and my loser first son-in-law were trying to bond, as my daughter says.
[98:14.33]Following back to the safe house.
[98:15.15]It's too dangerous out here.
[98:19.32]Sounds good, but my daughter, Kazmina, would probably kill me if something happened to her dimwit poker fiend of a husband.
[98:25.04]Better see if he's up to leaving.
[98:27.22]He's the fool over there in the helmet.
[98:30.48]Alright, we're all going.
[98:35.77]Let's go.
[98:38.03]He's trying to kill me.
[98:39.43]I'm not like a snake, man.
[98:44.11]Stop.
[98:47.63]Let's go.
[98:49.30]I wanted to play a little poker.

[99:27.34]Alright, let's move.
[99:35.48]Back to the safe house.
[99:38.03]Take the bow and fucking arrow?
[99:58.63]This thing sucks.
[100:06.10]That was a headshot.
[100:06.92]I have french fries and bow and arrows.

[101:21.51]Kenneth, goddammit.
[101:26.22]Holy shit, people die so much quicker in this game.
[101:31.08]Take some french fries.
[101:32.16]Before you die.
[101:33.86]Take some french fries, quick, please.
[101:37.36]Alright, let's go!

[102:59.91]There is a save point.
[103:05.25]No.
[103:06.82]I gotta go back this way.
[103:07.96]There's a save point right in the middle.
[103:09.48]Or is there a bathroom?
[103:11.90]There's no damn bathroom over here.

[113:34.00]Holy shit, okay.
[113:36.50]What can I do with the bow and arrow?
[113:37.36]Bow and arrow and battery?
[113:38.70]Can I make, like, electric bow?
[113:41.49]Damn it.
[113:45.64]Lawnmower and knife?
[113:50.33]Lawnmower and battery?
[113:54.59]Lawnmower and board of wood.
[114:15.83]Scratch cards?
[114:44.51]Okay.
[114:45.83]Shit, I can only bring one.
[114:47.55]Which is better?
[114:49.13]Oh, I gotta go.
[114:55.42]Alright, where's that save point right there?
[115:03.56]That's a lot of PP.
[115:15.10]Just in case I run into a huge problem.
[115:26.64]Okay, let's go.
[115:28.60]Game is saved.
[115:35.67]You just have to bump into people with this.
[115:37.15]This thing is actually great.
[115:40.75]You don't even need to use it.
[115:53.39]You're not killing them?
[115:54.31]I know, but I'm just trying to get through.
[116:01.50]Now what?
[116:01.86]Cat is back.
[116:29.90]You need to pay attention out here, buddy.
[116:33.00]Um, thanks.
[116:36.44]Rebecca Chang, Channel 6 Action News.
[116:39.86]Frank West.
[116:42.40]Oh, I know you.
[116:44.23]You used to be a kind of a hero of mine before you got washed up.
[116:49.99]You homesick for zombies.
[116:51.23]What are you doing here?
[116:53.01]Hey, I came to help with your story.
[116:56.01]I think cure's being set up.
[116:58.47]Nobody's gonna shake your hand.
[117:15.94]Reporters don't reveal their sources, Frank.
[117:19.26]Not real ones, anyway.
[117:22.38]I wouldn't underestimate Frank West, sweetheart.
[117:25.85]I got some pictures you might be interested in.
[117:27.79]Oh, that's right.
[117:28.19]We're both journalists.
[117:30.11]Okay.
[117:31.33]Let's see what you got.
[117:33.95]Not so fast.
[117:36.15]You gotta throw the old dog a bone before he does any tricks.
[117:41.85]Okay.
[117:42.89]Maybe I'll let you tag along for a while.
[117:45.78]That's more like it.
[117:46.94]That's the point in the video where you cut to her being eaten by 30 zombies and dying.
[117:52.58]There is a central security room.
[117:54.21]That's a pretty good cut point, I think.
[117:55.63]I can show you where it is.
[117:58.41]While spamming Y, and she's not following you.
[118:00.67]You show me yours, I show you mine.
[118:04.07]Where's your crew?
[118:07.73]They ran off with all the equipment.
[118:10.97]I guess they just didn't want it bad enough.
[118:20.62]I'm gonna steal that for my YouTube video.
[118:24.03]That's fine.
[118:25.73]I won 8% royalties on that video, though.
[118:28.67]Rebecca won't tell me her source, but she'll take me to Arena Security.
[118:33.60]Oh, don't!
[118:34.62]Don't hold that out!
[118:35.66]We have to do this, like, now?
[118:44.69]Follow Rebecca.
[118:47.16]Um, how do I talk to you without cutting you with this?
[118:50.01]Let's get going, try to keep up.
[118:51.89]Alright, is there any food?
[118:58.76]Can... Ooh, wait, key.
[119:01.48]Give me that back.
[119:03.52]Give me this back!
[119:04.32]Why would you... I just need to lean down.
[119:22.91]Where we going?
[119:24.75]Where we going?
[119:25.53]There's a bathroom here for me to take a breath- I- I know how to- You play the game!
[119:30.35]What?!
[119:33.31]I'm ready!
[119:35.30]We don't have time for this, I already went to the bathroom!
[119:54.76]What's this?
[119:58.24]A guy on a yellow motorcycle.
[120:01.38]Ooh, there's chainsaws.
[120:02.06]I don't need them.
[120:04.12]This thing's blinking.
[120:05.36]What does that mean?
[120:08.26]It's Mario.
[120:24.03]Autos.
[120:24.15]Oh no, he's spraying me.
[120:29.56]Minus $1,500.
[120:29.92]What are you guys doing?
[120:31.62]Money hacker.
[120:55.27]Alright.
[121:10.06]Alright, I'll take care of this.
[121:12.54]I'll remove all of their shoes.
[121:18.50]Oh, shit.
[121:19.51]I'm nothing without my weed whacker.
[121:21.25]I'm nothing without the weed whacker.
[121:22.35]If you're nothing without the weed whacker, you shouldn't have it.
[121:31.05]Why'd we whack her?
[121:31.73]Why'd we whack her?
[121:56.82]Okay, we're good.
[121:57.40]Cut scene.
[121:57.80]Saved by the cut scene.
[121:58.50]Haha!
[122:26.48]Oh!
[122:28.40]Whoa!
[122:31.52]Whoa-ho!
[122:32.46]By the way, I played Luigi's Mansion 3 for like 10, like 20 minutes.
[122:36.26]I have not heard more... Ah!
[122:38.44]Oh-ho's!
[122:40.04]Ever in a Mario game.
[122:43.24]Than in that game.
[122:49.83]Wait, don't leave me!
[122:58.29]Where's the checkpoint?
[123:06.19]Is there a checkpoint right there?
[123:17.30]Nice.
[123:19.04]I need a different weapon.
[123:23.29]But, no, what I was saying is... So, it doesn't matter what happens.
[123:29.42]Luigi, if it's scary, if it's exciting, Luigi always has the same reaction.
[123:40.10]Oh!
[123:40.28]Ha ha!
[123:42.86]Yeah!
[123:43.90]Whoa!
[123:45.88]Whoa!
[123:48.88]It happens every 15 to 20 seconds.
[123:55.60]Can you do something about this guy?
[124:03.87]I didn't say I didn't like it.
[124:04.89]It's a really fun game.
[124:06.27]Here, let me try.
[124:08.15]They didn't teach me that in journalism school.
[124:20.40]You went to journalism school?
[124:30.27]Hey, bro!
[124:30.75]Going to school for journalism, LOL.
[124:36.49]Guys, the internet may have changed a lot of things.
[124:40.17]But, like, 15, 20 years ago...
[124:59.08]you could you couldn't do it on a computer zombies don't use guns I'm not so sure here is not involved but it definitely proves someone's covering up what really happened not a bad lead kiddo now it's time to show me those pictures Frank
[125:20.27]Those are laptop motherboards.
[125:21.77]Yep.
[125:22.11]I gotta get out of here.
[125:25.31]That's with a bad guy, I have no idea.
[125:48.64]Someone's destroyed the security room.
[125:52.08]Well, I lose the game.
[126:00.79]Um, okay.
[126:01.53]So, I lose.
[126:05.21]I have to go out.
[126:06.15]I need heals.
[126:11.88]I'm dead.
[126:13.28]Why did I break that?
[126:13.96]I need the fucking stuff inside.
[126:26.06]I think I'm gonna... I think I'm locked... I think I'm locked out.
[126:44.27]So something that I didn't have to do in the last Dead Rising, but I'm probably gonna have to do here is... You realistically replay Dead Rising like three or four times.
[126:56.65]We might have to do that.
[127:11.32]Let's go!
[127:15.14]100 bucks for cheetahs.
[127:16.60]Yeah, that's kind of insane.
[127:17.80]But I don't know exactly how much time I have left, but it's not very much.
[127:35.62]It's sort of possible.
[127:45.54]It is, it's maybe remotely possible.
[127:53.01]How far away am I?
[127:56.11]It's gonna be, it's gonna be impossible, but we'll see.
[128:02.87]I might actually be able to do it if I just haul ass at the last save that I had.
[128:15.22]Use a wheelchair?
[128:15.92]I'm gonna unbuckle this.
[128:18.82]Shit.
[128:19.70]Damn it.
[128:23.73]It might be possible if I can... There's a money machine?
[128:29.97]Well, this just became one of my favorite games.
[128:37.46]It's right here.
[128:50.45]It's gotta be so close.
[128:55.17]Nobody breathe.
[129:08.84]I can do it.
[129:09.54]I can do it without getting snacks.
[129:11.07]I can do it without getting snacks.
[129:12.73]It's the snacks.
[129:15.03]It's possible without snacks and a wheelchair.
[129:24.12]I can get one.
[129:25.68]Oh, fuck.
[129:34.93]There's a checkpoint here, too?
[129:36.31]I have to load the save.
[129:39.39]Alright, I gotta be quicker.
[129:40.91]I can do it.
[129:41.33]I'm just gonna skip the cutscene and we'll go from there.
[129:49.30]Shit.
[129:49.92]Alright.
[129:52.72]The truth has vanished.
[129:56.26]So, the last save was right when I walked out the door.
[130:03.21]So this is day two at 2.30.
[130:07.84]Okay, I can do it from here.
[130:11.32]Yeah, this will be fine.
[130:20.97]Yeah, this is good.
[130:23.27]Because now I just got to go.
[130:26.45]Alright, we're going to do this quick.
[130:30.27]This is a good place to be, because it's just, follow me, I'm just gonna run to where I need to go.
[130:33.81]Still have some time.
[130:38.69]Just don't get hit unnecessarily by anything.
[130:53.02]Skip this.
[130:55.94]Here we go.
[130:57.92]Alright, I'm ready, let's go.
[131:02.79]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[131:13.70]Wheelchair?
[131:16.82]Can I... Can I put her in the wheelchair?
[131:29.82]Yeah, I know.
[131:30.42]Hey, Joe.
[131:31.50]Yep, let's go.
[131:32.06]I'm ready.
[131:44.23]Come on I'm supposed to be leading and then right out of this just run to where I need to go and get in a wheelchair Just run just get a wheelchair and run in the wheelchair from and just don't look at anything don't wait get a snack now Get the snacks now, and then when I want a better weapon than that that thing's too slow.
[132:07.33]Oh
[132:15.76]I didn't know you have to... It's right stick to aim.
[132:25.57]It's alright.
[132:26.23]We're fine.
[132:26.81]I still have time.
[132:27.63]I have enough time with a wheelchair.
[132:34.57]Go.
[132:34.91]Go, go, go, go, go!
[132:44.93]Run the way you're supposed to be running!
[132:46.21]Oh fuck!
[132:54.31]What did he throw at me?
[133:18.78]What?
[133:19.56]How did you hit me from that far away?
[133:21.94]That doesn't make any sense.
[133:27.36]Okay, leave.
[133:39.45]I got a new checkpoint.
[133:42.94]The axe.
[133:57.54]I'm trying to save you because you're in the way!
[133:59.14]Alright, that was faster than last time.

[134:24.68]What is the Xbox Game Bar?
[134:26.52]Why is it on?
[134:27.64]What is this thing?

[135:22.50]Alright, need a wheelchair.
[135:23.20]Where's a wheelchair?
[135:24.68]I see one.
[135:28.52]Of course I run on the fucking other side like an idiot.
[135:51.77]Alright, I think I'm going to make it.
[135:56.31]Pick up the wheelchair.
[135:58.71]Go!
[136:20.88]Open the door!

[136:54.33]Oh no, I have to go up the stairs.
[136:57.11]I have to go up the stairs.
[136:58.21]Not now.
[136:58.43]I don't have time.
[137:01.13]Ugh.
[137:04.29]Made it.
[137:05.85]You're nothing but a common criminal.
[137:09.23]You cause nothing but trouble.
[137:11.32]You're an innocent.
[137:11.90]It's a setup.
[137:14.04]I saw your buddies on TV, lady.
[137:15.84]I saw your picture.
[137:17.22]Hey.
[137:18.96]And a man like you.
[137:20.46]Real American.
[137:23.03]helping out trash like this.
[137:25.85]You don't need that kind of publicity, Bell.
[137:29.63]Sullivan, I think cure is being set up.
[137:33.00]I saw it on the TV with my own eyes.
[137:36.22]Explain how that little trick works.
[137:39.20]There's something else going on here, Sullivan.
[137:41.62]I found some evidence at the arena of a cover-up.
[137:44.59]It was on the TV.
[137:45.79]Smash that camera.
[137:46.53]Smash it quick.
[137:46.93]Just snatch the camera out of the hand.
[137:48.97]Smash into ground as hard as you fucking can.
[137:51.01]Done.
[138:14.98]But ain't no one gonna cover her ass when the military arrives.
[138:18.33]And she ain't allowed off the premises.
[138:20.35]I'll be guarding the door.
[138:21.99]Don't think I won't do what I have to do.
[138:29.36]There's not even a battery in that camera.
[138:30.70]Yeah, I hired her for some behind the scenes footage when we cut up the second DVD.
[138:46.57]Stacy, I'm Rebecca Chang, Channel 6 Action News.
[138:50.99]I'm here to help.
[138:52.17]Oh, you'll forgive me if I don't think it's very helpful that you accused my organization of a crime we didn't commit.
[138:59.29]Look, I don't know what's going on here, but clearly things are not as they seem.
[139:04.68]I put out the information I had at the time.
[139:07.20]Hey, I love a good cat fight, but we're not getting anywhere unless we work together, ladies.
[139:11.14]It's on my back.
[139:12.16]Works for me.
[139:12.98]Why do I have a turtle shell?
[139:14.26]You're innocent.
[139:15.46]Weren't guilty.
[139:17.10]I just want the truth.
[139:19.12]Thanks for the vote of confidence.
[139:21.54]But okay.
[139:22.99]We'll work together.
[139:24.17]Ogre.
[139:24.93]I'll keep an eye on these monitors.
[139:28.01]And I'm going back out there to see what I can find out.
[139:31.05]I'll let you know if I see anything.
[139:34.97]Uh...
[139:37.75]Ogre really is such a funny fucking word.
[139:42.92]You know what an ogre is.
[139:44.50]You don't even need to know what the word even is defined as.
[139:49.26]It just sounds like what that looks like.
[139:53.30]Alright, save and continue.
[140:08.38]Case 2-1.
[140:09.22]Good.
[140:09.52]Alright, I got time.
[140:13.16]Don't I need to get... I need Zombrex, too, don't I?
[140:18.09]This is kind of awkward.
[140:19.25]Um, I need Zombrex.
[140:33.18]Let's save it.
[140:37.44]Frank is just the apple from the community content stream.
[140:41.00]Yeah.
[140:42.05]It is.
[140:46.63]You just saved?
[140:47.41]I know.
[140:49.07]Okay, so let's just get out of here.
[140:52.43]We got a couple things I could... So on 6.30pm, I don't have that much time.
[140:56.72]Where's this?
[140:57.66]This one's pretty close.
[140:59.52]I can't do this one.
[141:04.80]They're on a bike.
[141:07.96]I think I can do Luscious Lady.
[141:13.36]Go do it.
[141:13.86]It's not possible.
[141:14.70]I can't do it.
[141:23.53]No, I can't be up against the clock every single time.
[141:30.85]Every time.
[141:31.63]I don't want to be sprinting back here going, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, please!
[141:36.34]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[141:38.86]I don't want to do that anymore.
[141:49.96]That makes for good content.
[141:53.15]I don't want it to be every time.
[142:00.53]Spray paint?
[142:03.38]Fire axe and nails.
[142:07.66]No.
[142:08.32]I'm gonna make another bat.
[142:09.22]The bat was good.
[142:16.89]Bat and bat.
[142:19.91]Bat and bat?
[142:30.82]Wouldn't... That would just be two bats.
[142:32.12]Alright, Luscious Lady.
[142:36.74]Check the recipes.
[142:38.38]Combo cards.
[142:41.90]Drill and Bucket.
[142:42.70]This is a... Pole Weapon.
[142:48.85]That's kind of cool.
[142:50.41]Porta Potty.
[142:52.07]Weed Tendonizer.
[142:54.95]Spike Bat.
[142:56.01]Gem Blower.
[142:56.77]I kind of want to... What do I need?
[142:57.81]A Leap Blower for this?
[143:03.56]Alright, if I come across another... I mean, that thing's funny, but is it really worth it?
[143:11.58]I want to do an air horn.
[143:14.71]I have the paint.
[143:16.01]Is there... I need a cone.
[143:19.65]Seriously.
[143:22.67]I'm just going to drink all the coffee cream over here.
[143:31.74]No, no.
[143:32.56]Get your own.
[143:36.16]Get... Wait in line like everybody else.
[143:45.21]Brownies?
[143:47.73]Oh, that healed me to full.
[143:50.83]Alright, let me get a spray paint back.
[143:53.77]Fuck the bow and arrow.
[143:54.69]It's not good.
[143:55.18]Alright, I'm good.
[143:58.56]I gotta go this way.

[144:47.53]Okay.
[144:48.29]I don't even know what happened there.
[144:49.43]This fucking emulator.
[144:53.11]Alright, somebody puked back here.
[144:54.13]I gotta take care of them.
[145:02.78]You alright?
[145:07.36]Hi there.
[145:08.00]Wait, you're not Josh.
[145:09.10]Where'd he run off to?
[145:12.61]Josh?
[145:14.49]Yeah, he was in that nice little bachelor party that kept buying me drinks.
[145:18.87]Man, some... A lot of things died out there.
[145:22.75]Listen, lady, there are zombies everywhere.
[145:24.23]We gotta go.
[145:26.95]Oh, yeah.
[145:28.66]Hiccup, there's that Terror is Reality show in town tomorrow.
[145:31.74]That TK is...
[145:36.62]Test of blood.
[145:38.52]Yesterday, that last thing I remember was Josh and those boys buying me drinks.
[145:41.95]I must have passed out.
[145:42.89]Okay.
[145:44.35]Well, this is probably like here.
[145:46.83]Have a brownie.
[145:50.71]Have a handgun.
[145:53.01]Come with me.
[145:53.39]It isn't safe out here.
[145:54.11]And I can take you where you can lie down and get something to drink.
[145:56.12]There's a safe house.
[146:00.84]Take it.
[146:01.10]That's not what I meant.
[146:02.70]Never mind.
[146:02.94]Let's just get out of here.
[146:03.68]Let's go.
[146:08.15]Wow, looking a little sloppy there.
[146:10.47]Here, take... No, what?
[146:14.13]I have to carry you?
[146:15.31]You can't do anything about this?
[146:17.95]Here, take a gun.
[146:19.98]I have to carry you.
[146:21.94]This is not good.
[146:24.48]Okay.
[146:30.74]I can open doors, thank God.
[146:32.08]Alright, um... Let's get you back to the safe house, because I can't just leave you.
[146:38.85]Wheelchair!
[146:39.49]Get in the wheelchair!
[146:40.89]This is perfect.
[146:45.02]Get in the wheelchair.
[146:49.64]Can I put you in the wheelchair?
[146:55.36]You can't do that?
[147:00.00]If I can push the wheelchair, that's absurd.
[147:02.26]Oh god, let's go.
[147:11.88]You can.
[147:12.70]What?
[147:15.10]There's a guy crying.
[147:22.34]Where is he?
[147:24.70]He's fucking far away.
[147:28.41]Yeah, you're far away.
[147:30.49]No, I gotta bring you back.
[147:36.19]He reads every time.
[147:37.15]It's because I just played Dead Rising 1 and had to read them all.
[148:00.02]Come on, hurry up.
[148:01.91]Read movie posters.
[148:14.76]Do people like us.
[148:15.88]You killed Chuck.
[148:17.34]At least give us this.
[148:20.10]Well, thanks for the spoiler.
[148:22.82]I appreciate the spoiler.
[148:26.26]Hmm, I wonder what that mission is.
[148:28.70]No, it has nothing to do with the other protagonist.
[148:33.99]Where is it?
[148:35.39]People like us.
[148:37.13]I'm gonna save the game, and if I have time to do it, we'll see.
[148:41.13]Spoilers for Infinity War.
[148:43.67]Read posters.
[148:47.21]Alright, I'm gonna save the game in the bathroom.
[148:54.20]This is important, Jeremy.
[148:55.38]Take erotica pictures.
[148:58.14]It's important.
[149:01.24]Go talk to Stacy.
[149:18.16]I need to actually... Oh, there's a full orange juice in here.
[149:22.65]Okay, cool.
[149:24.93]Take a picture of somebody.
[149:26.43]Who should I take a picture of?
[149:27.23]Where are they?
[149:33.22]In here?
[149:35.36]It's important to me.
[149:40.48]Oh, I don't know where she is.
[149:47.24]Oh, there we go.
[149:48.42]Frank, we've got to find out who's framing Cure.
[149:52.38]And we will.
[149:53.08]Frank West doesn't know how to give up on a story.
[149:57.08]Okay.
[150:02.76]I'm gonna go.
[150:07.87]Ooh!
[150:09.59]Give me this instead of, um... the... wine.
[150:14.91]I still want this.
[150:20.82]So now it's that and... What was it?
[150:24.30]And... Ah, it's spray paint.
[150:25.66]I don't have spray paint.
[150:30.10]Shit.
[150:35.55]Dude, I'm already in the red.
[150:43.89]I'm just gonna have to do the case.
[150:44.95]Yeah, I mean, he should... I got a full, like, day to do this, don't I?
[150:51.33]Is there any spray paint in here?
[150:54.03]No.
[150:57.47]Yeah, I have like a whole day.
[150:58.42]So I'm just going to go out here and explore for a little bit.
[151:00.18]I want to try to get spray paint.
[151:11.87]Go get Zombrex.
[151:12.83]Yeah, I need some...
[151:15.50]There's paint right there.
[151:16.24]Alright, let me, uh, replace... What the hell do I want to replace?
[151:25.76]Alcohol?
[151:26.28]Just drink it.
[151:29.14]Okay, let's go make this.
[151:31.33]Oh, motherfucker.
[151:35.75]I swear to god.
[151:38.49]Okay.
[151:51.26]This, uh, so much backseating.
[151:54.03]Well, I already... We already talked about it.
[151:55.53]This is what happens when you play, like, a beloved 10 to 15 year old game.
[152:08.12]Alright, I got an air horn now.
[152:19.55]This thing's stupid.
[152:23.35]Already at 87%?
[152:23.87]I'm gonna hold onto this, though.
[152:26.39]I feel like I'm gonna need this.
[152:27.33]Let's just, uh, grind.
[152:48.55]I see two guys in... I'm not sure if they're laughing or fighting.
[152:55.60]Alright, we got... Two's company.
[153:02.60]Where are they?
[153:03.20]Right here?
[153:06.29]People... He's... It's right here.
[153:07.69]Let's see if I can do them both.
[153:18.40]It's saved right before this anyways.
[153:19.74]Somebody wants money?
[153:27.23]They can get it from me.
[153:28.31]Because there's no time?
[153:35.51]It's alright.
[153:40.05]This'll be around for... Zom... I need Zombrex.
[153:48.97]Oh, it's you.
[153:51.11]I want that bunny hacker.
[153:57.23]It's like a kidney shot.
[153:58.84]Almost level 7.
[153:59.74]I need a flashlight.
[154:18.12]Flashlight.
[154:20.20]Stop pushing this.
[154:21.04]Okay, flashlight.
[154:26.76]Got it.
[154:29.94]I think that didn't even do anything.
[154:40.51]That doesn't do anything.
[154:48.17]Alright, I have a flashlight now.
[154:49.23]Uh, somebody said I can combine this with gems.
[155:02.73]Wasting time?
[155:03.53]Well, I'm not gonna be able to do the people like us.
[155:09.52]I've come to the conclusion.
[155:14.78]Basketball.
[155:24.71]Urgent.
[155:25.13]Frank, can you come back to the security room?
[155:28.33]I gotta go.
[155:28.79]Alright, yeah.
[155:33.74]These will only be around for a little while.
[155:45.93]Security guard.
[155:47.43]Nice.
[155:48.75]That was a home run.
[155:56.12]Stop playing porn.
[156:03.21]Why do I look like a GTA Online character?
[156:06.39]Well, it's because... I... Wait.
[156:12.31]No.
[156:13.91]I can't do it.
[156:23.50]That's a good answer.
[156:24.20]Well, because I haven't done any of the clothes.
[156:27.96]I'm up against a clock.
[156:30.06]I've got to get out there, and I've got to make shit happen.
[156:34.88]Which game do I like better?
[156:35.84]That's not a fair question, I don't think.
[156:42.59]Not yet.
[156:56.53]Man, ask me like in another couple hours.
[157:12.28]Ask me when I'm at my angriest.
[157:13.61]Yeah, we'll see.
[157:15.01]What's going on?
[157:16.31]I'm pretty sure I saw somebody dragging a girl into the washroom over here.
[157:19.89]Oh yeah?
[157:22.27]Well, maybe if we watch these monitors for a minute.
[157:24.83]What the hell?
[157:26.15]Hey, that's the guy I saw taking money from TK.
[157:34.10]Oh, no, not him.
[157:36.33]He's part of Cure.
[157:37.75]240p.
[157:40.17]You guys ever notice that security cameras are like company computers?
[157:46.49]I got your office building.
[157:48.33]Hear me out.
[157:49.99]There are office buildings that are still on Vista.
[157:54.56]And XP and shit.
[157:57.02]Why are security cameras still on cell phone camera from like 2004?
[158:01.22]Frank.
[158:08.87]It's because it's cheap.
[158:10.51]But you think the thing to identify people coming into your store and potentially stealing something or hurting somebody or don't you think you want to be able to have a good image of that person?
[158:26.50]Why have something like smearing peanut butter on the lens?
[158:35.18]It takes up hard drive space.
[158:39.06]You don't have to have, like, super HD 4K resolution.
[158:43.40]Frank said, uh, slime them?
[158:46.68]What?
[158:58.87]Older systems have less vulnerability.
[159:00.65]Really?
[159:02.73]Really?
[159:05.93]Alright, here we go.
[159:06.65]Case 2-2, a familiar face.
[159:08.67]I got lots of time now.
[159:10.49]I need to go... We gotta have a game plan.
[159:13.68]Who said that?
[159:14.40]Somebody just said that!
[159:17.62]I just read that.
[159:19.60]Alright, let's start.
[159:20.26]I need Zombrex.
[159:21.76]Otherwise, I'm dead.
[159:23.42]So, let's start back here at Art Appreciation, and then we're gonna go to his company, and then people like us.
[159:31.49]It all keeps happening, again and again.
[159:39.06]Alright, let's save the game.
[159:40.32]I know I just did, and everyone's gonna be like, you just did this.
[159:42.58]I know.
[159:47.30]And look at movie posters.
[159:48.24]I will.
[159:50.34]And get gems.
[159:52.40]Alright.
[159:53.62]Any other requests?
[159:56.59]Anybody want... What do you want?
[159:58.19]You want a large?
[160:00.09]With two Splenda?
[160:02.15]Okay.
[160:02.59]What about you?
[160:05.15]You just want a small black iced coffee.
[160:07.39]Okay, good.
[160:08.15]Anybody else want anything?
[160:08.81]Okay.
[160:24.90]I can make another one.
[160:25.68]Yeah, I'll make another one.
[160:32.06]Just in case I'm gonna need it.
[160:56.12]This shit is so loud, I have to turn it off.
[160:59.74]Okay.
[161:03.95]FMV.
[161:05.05]Pre-rendered cutscenes.
[161:11.57]Okay, anything else?
[161:13.05]I need gems, somebody said.
[161:14.87]Get gems, get gems, get gems.
[161:17.76]Hold on.
[161:21.64]Okay, get gems, get gems.
[161:26.09]Get rid of this.
[161:26.89]I've got good weapons.
[161:36.65]Now, I don't want case 2-2 to just go all the way down to yellow.
[161:42.14]Because that's how you get screwed.
[161:50.66]Universe of Optics.
[161:51.42]We're looking for a gem store.
[161:55.50]on the way.
[161:58.22]Wait.
[161:59.16]Oh, yeah.
[162:01.00]No, I hate this.
[162:03.62]I've seen, like, a video where somebody had this on.
[162:05.51]I can't work.
[162:13.29]That was your video.
[162:20.09]Points don't stand.
[162:27.14]That's a pretty nice dodge.
[162:31.55]What's in here?
[162:33.37]Okay, we got... I need money.
[162:36.33]I have to start... I can't believe... Where this all went so, so wrong... Was when I gave that guy $25,000.
[162:43.42]That ruined the whole playthrough.
[162:48.28]Uh...
[162:56.81]And he died.
[162:57.33]10,000 bucks!
[163:04.19]That's kinda crazy.
[163:10.58]What if I got the shoes?
[163:11.46]Is somebody chasing me?
[163:20.91]No shoes.
[163:21.71]I can't take them.
[163:22.99]What are these?
[163:25.75]No.
[163:29.21]How did you even get it in here?
[163:30.87]What a throw.
[163:32.66]Leave me alone.
[163:33.36]Just die already!
[163:56.22]Speed increase.
[163:56.98]Nice.
[163:57.50]Thank God.
[163:58.34]And I got a new skill?
[163:59.04]What is it?
[164:05.14]The money hacker?
[164:06.46]Get money hacker.
[164:07.24]Get money hacker.
[164:09.14]Snapshot.
[164:09.78]Hold right trigger, press right bumper.
[164:14.94]Hold right... What was it?
[164:26.51]Yeah, give me the hacker.
[164:30.29]Flashlight and computer case.
[164:32.95]That is gone immediately.
[164:34.33]That does not have any durability at all.
[164:37.90]Okay.
[164:39.44]I didn't know it was like that crazy.
[164:52.94]It hacks money.
[164:56.38]Alright.
[165:00.32]Okay, let's keep... I want that head.
[165:10.05]There's a bathroom right here.
[165:14.77]Let's save it.
[165:16.79]Anything in there?
[165:17.39]No.
[165:17.45]These are fun to use.
[165:31.80]It's a maintenance room.
[165:37.66]Wrench.
[165:39.02]What else is in here?
[165:40.04]Ooh, shit.
[165:40.78]Can they come in here?
[165:41.64]Is this a safe spot?
[165:46.12]Am I safe in here?
[165:46.68]Okay, drill.
[165:51.12]And machete.
[165:55.05]Drill.
[166:07.48]Why did I not hit him?
[166:10.34]Frank, you better get to the pub of gold.
[166:19.07]Why did I not hit him then?
[166:22.07]I just killed him.
[166:24.79]I just killed him.
[166:27.17]Give me the... Jesus Christ.
[166:41.52]I just exploded this guy's brain.
[166:43.86]Can't get in there.
[166:44.72]Alright, give me the broom.
[166:50.99]What are you fucking doing in here?!
[167:03.43]Jeez!
[167:04.83]No, I want to pick up the one that's on the ground, sir.
[167:10.51]Okay, cool.
[167:18.39]I'm ready.
[167:21.13]And I want my bat back, too.
[167:33.20]This thing's awesome.
[167:35.24]It has a pretty long windup, but...
[167:45.96]This thing is incredible.
[167:48.50]No, I don't wanna... Thing's about to break anyways.
[167:52.87]Let's go.
[168:10.32]That was angry.
[168:11.04]Just me and my wheelchair, that's right.
[168:40.82]Art, appreciation.
[168:47.87]Okay.
[168:54.83]Checkpoint reached.
[168:57.81]Looking for somebody in here.
[168:59.35]Over this way?
[169:00.13]Art, there's somebody freaking out over here, right?
[169:01.89]Is this fish?
[169:03.75]Oh, shit, there's a key.
[169:05.49]Where are these security boxes, too?
[169:07.78]I need to get those.
[169:25.70]800 bucks?
[169:26.08]Alright, I need 50,000 for that Zombrex.
[169:37.15]Is there a save in here?
[169:37.91]When's the last time I saved it?
[169:38.83]Alright, right, I'm gonna save it through here.
[169:42.25]This is the right way, right?
[169:45.77]Is it?
[169:47.03]No.
[169:48.01]Wait, is the save point in here?
[169:53.96]It's down here.
[170:00.48]No, it's not.
[170:02.70]I can't even go in here.
[170:03.95]God damn it.
[170:04.87]It's locked!
[170:07.93]It does, you're right!
[170:08.83]Chainsaw?
[170:17.09]You never know, there could be something wild back here.
[170:19.15]Okay, I've got... How much healing do I have?
[170:21.90]I probably have one decent hero.
[170:33.06]Why are you not playing the slot machine?
[170:34.88]Because I'm trying to get stuff done.
[170:36.92]I don't want to run out of time.
[170:38.00]I put in 100 and I got 800 back.
[170:43.41]It says you get extra money.
[170:44.21]Okay, 27,000.
[171:09.89]Is there like a super jackpot?
[171:22.06]The money booth.
[171:23.34]Shit, you're right.
[171:23.92]No, no time.
[171:25.52]I want to clean some of these things up.
[171:29.35]Alright, this is in yellow.
[171:38.03]Let's get this done.
[171:41.97]All the way down here.
[171:42.85]Oh, right.
[171:43.99]Now, if you look at the posters, right?
[171:45.87]Guitar shop.
[171:50.45]What is this?
[171:52.30]Upstairs?
[171:58.70]Hard appreciation.
[172:02.51]Is there somebody talking?
[172:11.68]Alright, Chris's fine foods.
[172:14.46]I gotta remember that.
[172:29.03]Wasn't quick enough.
[172:30.29]That guy's got a money machine thing.
[172:31.55]He's got a money hacker.
[172:42.96]Alright, give me that thing.
[172:47.32]Things seem really slow.
[172:48.34]Alright, money machine.
[172:52.83]I don't even... What do I need this flashlight for?
[172:54.43]This thing's about to be done.
[172:59.93]What do I have for a good weapon?
[173:01.15]Not really anything.
[173:02.23]I gotta keep the crowbar.
[173:03.23]That thing's gonna break.
[173:05.01]Gun.
[173:06.37]Gun instead of, um...
[173:12.30]Gems. Gems. Gems. Gems. Gems.
[173:21.00]Give me them.
[173:22.00]Did I just break them?
[173:26.00]Okay- gems. Alright, I'm ready.
[173:31.10]I don't have a weapon.
[173:33.22]Just eat the fish.
[173:40.38]Let's go.
[173:45.20]Gems and flashlight.
[173:46.54]Now I need a maintenance room.
[173:48.68]There's one across from the... across the street.
[173:53.21]Over there.
[173:55.55]I'm gonna do this first.
[173:59.87]Lead on bone.
[174:00.77]Yeah.
[174:05.17]This is a really shitty weapon.
[174:07.07]Um...
[174:18.39]Poster.
[174:31.25]That noise.
[174:32.53]Okay, let me just do this.
[174:33.61]Pretty good bait.
[174:44.16]Here we go.
[174:45.84]Gems.
[174:47.44]Flashlight.
[174:49.25]Let's take a look.
[174:53.97]If this is not one of the best items in the whole game, I'm going to be really upset.
[174:58.17]The amount of times that I looked over and saw, in all capitals, Gems and Flashlight.
[175:03.92]I mean, it's cool.
[175:09.32]It's pretty cool.
[175:10.50]Newspaper and what?
[175:11.86]Whiskey?
[175:15.77]Whiskey and Lawnmower?
[175:20.77]This is a Molotov.
[175:22.49]It makes a Super Whiskey.
[175:35.63]Firehands.
[175:37.49]Okay.
[175:39.47]Two by four.
[175:41.37]And, ooh, I can do this.
[175:51.78]Oh, what about the money machine?
[175:56.68]Alright, fuck the gun.
[176:03.18]Take the port-a-potty, let's go.
[176:04.30]I need a save point.
[176:07.92]It's across the way.
[176:08.76]Okay, I know what I'm doing.
[176:16.57]This is exactly what a lawnmower sounds like.
[176:26.31]I feel like somebody's actually longing for it.
[176:36.78]Alright, a save point.
[176:39.18]Down there.
[177:10.04]Save it here.
[177:13.10]Save it here.
[177:17.91]Uh, we'll take slot 2.
[177:33.56]Use the power attack.
[177:34.08]And that power attack... Holy shit, that's 250p!
[177:35.18]That's a lot, actually.
[177:35.66]Alright, let's keep going.
[177:36.28]Let's go, I appreciate that.
[178:05.59]There we go.
[178:05.85]Okay, all my life's worked my thing, except for failure.
[178:07.27]Alright.
[178:07.53]Hey.
[178:07.61]Don't worry about it up here.
[178:08.21]Randolph, you and me, we're gonna get out of here.
[178:09.33]Everybody, you alright?
[178:09.81]Do I look okay?
[178:10.11]This is my life's work.
[178:10.67]This is my first painting to make an even arc out of it.
[178:11.83]And no one will ever buy it.
[178:12.51]Listen, I'm sorry about that.
[178:13.22]It's not safe up here.
[178:13.70]Follow me.
[178:31.30]No, no, you don't understand.
[178:32.02]It's not worth getting on.
[178:32.90]I'm such a failure.
[178:34.00]If no one buys it, then I'll die with my greens.
[178:43.29]If I lose another 10-20k right now, 3,000 bucks, that's how much my greens cost.
[178:48.37]Take it or leave it.
[178:49.81]Please, take it.
[179:04.84]Thank you, Niershu, for the five subs.
[179:06.48]He's just gonna end up dying.
[179:08.90]Let's go.
[179:11.16]It's all yours.
[179:11.90]You've made my dreams come true.
[179:20.11]Horror.
[179:21.69]That's a nice touch.
[179:22.53]I like that.
[179:23.07]Wait, I gotta get you in the photo.
[179:30.05]Alright.
[179:32.28]Alright.
[179:35.31]Here.
[179:36.01]You want to take the lawnmower?
[179:36.91]What can you take?
[179:37.47]You want the lightsaber?
[179:40.85]How would you not want a lightsaber?
[179:42.49]What's wrong with you?
[179:45.05]There.
[179:53.31]Take a vase.
[179:55.11]Weirdo.
[179:56.49]Oh, painting!
[179:57.16]Wait, make him use his own painting.
[180:04.72]I smashed it over his head.
[180:06.82]Here, you take the painting.
[180:24.38]Fuck your painting.
[180:29.18]Okay.
[180:30.26]So, I have you now.
[180:32.10]Let's go to his company.
[180:34.90]I need Zombrex.
[180:40.02]Investigate the laughing guys.
[180:47.17]Does anybody have Zombrex?
[181:08.23]I'm dead in like 12 10 hours moving
[181:39.95]Alright, let's go.
[181:40.67]You guys can't hear me.
[181:51.34]It's okay.
[181:53.52]This thing's about to be done in a second anyway.
[181:56.22]Alright, looters.
[182:07.90]Why would I throw the... Why would I... Holy shit, his brain exploded.
[182:16.82]This thing's great!
[182:20.39]Okay.
[182:22.49]I... I... I agree.
[182:24.23]It's very good.
[182:26.65]Alright, let's do it!
[182:54.36]Go!
[182:54.62]Hustle!
[182:59.82]How you doing on health?
[183:03.56]You alright?
[183:04.72]Okay, we're good.
[183:10.43]Checkpoint reached.
[183:18.87]Oh shit.
[183:19.45]Okay, I need the laser sword.
[183:31.23]Where is this guy?
[183:37.85]Watch your head.
[183:40.30]Alright, you need to drink this.
[183:49.94]Drink it!
[183:53.20]Drink it!
[183:53.60]Drink it!
[183:53.92]Oh my god!
[184:03.36]Wait, I can't kick?
[184:04.76]I need to give him food.
[184:11.08]The backswing is... He's gonna die.
[184:20.52]The jump kick doesn't do a jump kick, you swing the sword!
[184:23.24]Follow me, this way.
[184:31.04]Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay.
[184:32.18]I'll get you some food.
[184:32.99]I'll find something.
[184:35.29]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
[185:06.53]This thing's almost broken.
[185:07.33]Um... What is in here?
[185:12.04]Food?
[185:13.44]Yep.
[185:13.88]Get in here.
[185:21.90]Just drink until there's nothing else here.
[185:28.24]Here.
[185:29.86]Drink another cocktail.
[185:35.35]Take another one.
[185:41.34]The lizard mask.
[185:43.60]Take this wine.
[185:47.65]You need to heal.
[186:11.76]Are you done?
[186:21.13]He needs to be healed!
[186:23.41]You don't understand.
[186:25.57]Okay, I have enough.
[186:26.65]I'm gonna take... What the hell is going on here with this weird Klon music?
[186:35.39]Alright, you ready?
[186:41.12]I need to give him a weapon.
[186:44.58]He's so... I have to carry him.
[186:48.00]He's so slow.
[186:48.74]Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[186:52.23]We don't have much time.
[186:54.81]It's broken.
[187:00.09]Oh, shit.
[187:00.55]Come back in here.
[187:03.57]I need a...
[187:09.06]Let's give it the chair.
[187:09.74]Alright.
[187:10.98]Oh shit, there's a full lobster in here.
[187:18.77]Alright, we'll need that later.
[187:21.41]Wait, take this bucket.
[187:42.90]Okay, let's do it.
[187:48.99]Alright, where is this person?
[187:53.25]Straight and then right, and then people like us is right there.
[187:55.51]But once... I need... Zombrex.
[188:00.75]How am I ever going to do anything?
[188:02.60]I didn't want to throw that.
[188:06.38]Get that back.
[188:21.09]Free Zombrex.
[188:22.49]I would wear this free Zombrex in there?
[188:24.35]Well, hold on.
[188:24.89]Let me save.
[188:26.60]I'm gonna go save it and do this mission.
[188:30.40]Move it!
[188:32.36]This way!
[188:40.77]I need to find Zonbrex.
[188:42.63]Okay, the actual mission is straight to the right.
[188:48.03]I'm gonna go to the safe point.
[188:53.51]That's a funny alien mask.
[188:59.50]Funny alien mask.
[189:00.48]No, no, don't do it.
[189:01.56]It's not even that funny.
[189:04.08]Vending machine?
[189:04.70]What's this do?
[189:11.46]What the hell was that?
[189:16.10]No, stop!
[189:16.68]I want to pick it up!
[189:21.25]Is it a grenade?
[189:22.93]He thinks it's funny.
[189:23.63]Alright, no time.
[189:37.83]Safe point.
[189:38.87]Straight ahead.
[189:39.85]Speed it up.
[189:41.25]Let's hustle it up.
[189:45.14]Come on.
[189:45.94]Hey, keep up.
[189:48.94]Keep up.
[189:50.38]Hurry it up.
[189:54.42]Let's hustle it up.
[189:55.58]Hurry.
[189:56.74]This way.
[189:59.06]Let's go.
[189:59.94]No.
[190:01.76]Follow me.
[190:06.47]Hurry up.
[190:08.55]You can make it!
[190:09.53]Stop swinging, stop swinging, and run!
[190:11.77]Run!
[190:14.27]Hey, wait!
[190:14.77]Have some... Have a... Was that a sandwich?
[190:17.27]No.
[190:18.41]I have a lobster.
[190:19.05]You can eat a lobster in a minute.
[190:29.08]Case 2-2.
[190:29.98]Alright, I'm starting to hit that moment where I need to, uh... Hey, I'm waiting on you!
[190:37.12]I'm at that moment where I gotta start to think about doing the actual case now.
[190:44.98]Accomplished nothing.
[190:53.22]I've got Randolph.
[190:57.80]The whole point was to go get Randolph.
[191:02.99]Let's see what happens here.
[191:09.00]There's plenty of food right here.
[191:09.90]We're both gonna just eat fucking shit.
[191:15.64]Okay, here, take one.
[191:23.36]Just get over here.
[191:24.00]I need this up here.
[191:25.26]Whoa, there's a broadsword up here.
[191:28.28]There's a shield and shit?
[191:30.82]Here, eat.
[191:32.49]Eat something.
[191:56.66]We're gonna eat this my lobster.
[191:58.76]Give me your money!
[192:16.84]I'm just gonna start it again.
[192:22.00]Dremel, why?
[192:23.50]I hit him with a woogie sword in the back and he defected.
[192:49.29]Which one is this one, right?
[192:50.19]Day 2 is in red area.
[192:51.31]Day 1 is this one, right?
[192:52.51]It's this one right here.
[192:53.21]Which one is it?
[192:53.75]Total PP?
[192:54.29]It's this one right here.
[192:54.93]Let me see if it's this one.
[192:55.59]Top one.
[193:00.19]What's going on?
[193:05.30]Okay.
[193:07.32]Don't be such a fucking asshole.
[193:10.52]We're trying to do this together.
[193:17.26]I'm safe scumming for Randolph, but not for the tiger.
[193:19.46]I had one health during that tiger part.
[193:24.14]I was fucked during the tiger part.
[193:28.14]Okay, don't have to repeat what just happened.
[193:36.54]No, give me the broadsword.
[193:51.75]Well, how did so many end up over here?
[193:55.91]He's not gonna defect.
[193:57.19]I need to get rid of... Just eat the lobster, Randolph.
[193:59.85]Just take it.
[194:00.37]It's yours.
[194:03.28]Get in the bathroom.
[194:04.14]Get in the bathroom.
[194:04.86]This is un-ridiculous.
[194:07.10]This is not even the bathroom.
[194:08.32]Just take the lobster and eat it.
[194:11.26]Eat this!
[194:16.34]Okay.
[194:17.10]You good?
[194:28.44]Follow me!
[194:29.80]I don't care if you don't have an item.
[194:32.28]Now I gotta eat popcorn and shit.
[194:33.83]Let's go!
[194:56.22]No way are you funnier.
[194:58.26]I've been telling jokes for a long time.
[195:01.36]Yeah, I can tell.
[195:01.88]You can tell you're so old.
[195:02.93]A couple of joke tellers?
[195:10.13]Whoa, a living person!
[195:14.03]He must not have heard your scent.
[195:15.25]Maybe he can settle this.
[195:22.26]Randolph, get in here.
[195:27.95]Leave it alone.
[195:28.99]Okay, I have to decide who's funnier.
[195:31.63]I can see two... Hey, buddy, can you help us out here?
[195:40.72]Yeah, just follow me.
[195:41.44]I can get us to safety.
[195:43.92]Hold your horses there, sport.
[195:45.00]You have to settle an argument first.
[195:50.38]Okay, what's the argument?
[195:51.90]Let him explain our little game first.
[195:53.60]Come on, it will be worth it.
[195:59.52]Normally, I make a living doing just that, but I'm serious.
[196:03.60]Me and my friend here are in town for the Fortune City Comedy Festival.
[196:10.03]Go on.
[196:11.59]We were both up for the Comedian of the Year, but these zombies stole the show, and they're one hard act to follow.
[196:17.33]We will each tell you our best joke, and you give the trophy on the count of who you think is funnier.
[196:22.49]Okay.
[196:23.63]I have to decide who's funnier.
[196:29.39]Alright, you, Walter, go first.
[196:32.95]What does a vegan zombie eat?
[196:37.21]Grains!
[196:39.25]Get it?
[196:39.75]Grains!
[196:41.83]You automatically lose.
[196:44.35]If you're a tasteful man like myself and you're sick and tired of old comedians trying to be funny and just ending up pathetic, it's just sad.
[196:49.83]Allow me to lay down some fresh lines from the new hotness of comedy.
[196:53.13]Okay.
[196:54.67]What do sloppy zombies get on their clothes when they eat?
[197:00.61]Sustains!
[197:01.97]Oh, snap.
[197:03.45]Sustains.
[197:06.47]Oh, no.
[197:07.21]This is really... That's actually... That's way funnier.
[197:20.53]Go cry to your wife about this.
[197:22.15]Tell her I said thanks.
[197:26.12]Wait, Walther doesn't join?
[197:27.16]You just had to encourage him, didn't you?
[197:31.41]Oh.
[197:35.11]Ranged attack.
[197:35.81]Increased.
[197:36.71]New skill move.
[197:37.41]Alright, we need to get you guys weapons.
[197:38.97]Here, can you handle the spear?
[197:42.77]Okay, good.
[197:44.15]Um... I'm gonna let you keep that trophy.
[197:50.15]What else we got?
[197:50.63]Uh...
[197:58.63]At least you'll do something here.
[198:00.04]Okay, music discs.
[198:01.50]What else we got?
[198:03.26]A stick pony.
[198:06.52]Can I actually run with this on?
[198:11.61]In fact, you'll be more useful with this.
[198:13.45]Okay.
[198:13.83]You guys ready?
[198:16.39]Let's go!
[198:16.69]Find Zombrex.
[198:17.21]Ugh.
[198:27.27]I gotta find... This is the case.
[198:32.31]I'm gonna bang a right, save the game, and then I'm just gonna go for the case.
[198:40.73]Yep.
[198:45.85]Bring him back first.
[198:50.28]That's all the way back here.
[198:54.10]Get these people back first.
[198:55.34]Look how that's so far away.
[199:01.53]Let me save it right here, and I'll figure it out.
[199:08.12]Follow me!
[199:15.16]Speed it up!
[199:17.10]I think I'm just gonna do the case with him.
[199:19.83]Let's move!
[199:20.57]Hurry!
[199:22.01]This way!
[199:22.75]Come on!
[199:23.29]Speed it up!
[199:25.07]Follow me!
[199:28.37]At least enough to start it.
[199:29.83]It's already green.
[199:30.65]I mean, it's already yellow.
[199:33.15]This is not the bathroom.
[199:39.39]What the hell is the bathroom?
[199:42.03]Wait, it is the bathroom.
[199:44.34]Oh, yeah.
[199:52.04]Who's the bathroom?
[199:55.42]And this is Ombrex.
[200:00.52]Wait, this Zombrek's back here?
[200:06.08]Where?
[200:14.98]Climb.
[200:18.72]Can I climb up?
[200:25.94]Do I have to make this jump?
[200:30.83]I guess I can go up this way.
[200:37.19]Um... Spotlight?
[200:44.88]Am I wasting time right now?
[200:46.74]Is this a lie?
[200:47.30]Yeah, it's a bait.
[200:57.12]Oh, give me a fucking break.
[201:09.18]Good.
[201:09.68]I wasted a full, like, one full minute.
[201:16.97]Do you see my predicament, though?
[201:22.57]For every, like, 100 people that, say, climb the Zombrex up there, there's another, like, group of people that are also doing that about combining the flashlight and the gems.
[201:39.61]So some of them are real.
[201:49.56]I'm gonna do another slot just in case something horrible happens.
[201:55.10]Let's do the case.
[202:00.34]Case is all the way over there.
[202:02.44]It shouldn't be that far.
[202:08.43]Let's hustle it up.
[202:19.56]Well, that's not good.
[202:25.30]Randolph!
[202:28.42]Moving.
[202:31.28]Hurry it up.
[202:33.97]Hurry up.
[202:35.09]Hurry, this way.
[202:35.95]Speed it up.
[202:41.77]I'm gonna have to get the pretzel from Randolph.
[202:46.93]What is going on over here?
[202:48.49]Randolph, pretzel!
[202:50.32]Pretzel.
[202:51.24]No!
[202:52.22]Oh, how'd he get out?
[203:19.48]Go this way.
[203:20.46]Follow me this way.
[203:21.12]Follow me this way.
[203:21.88]Go.
[203:24.15]Randolph, you're doing a great job standing still.
[203:26.83]Very good job.
[203:29.09]Keep up.
[203:33.07]Come on.
[203:36.58]Quick.
[203:37.02]Follow me.
[203:37.68]This way.
[203:39.14]Hurry it up.
[203:41.04]Hurry.
[203:44.12]This way.
[203:45.40]Move it.
[203:47.00]Keep up.
[203:47.61]Lean it up.
[203:50.34]Now he's done.
[203:51.96]I'm just trying to see if there's a food place.
[203:59.12]You guys are alright.
[204:02.58]Food?
[204:04.14]Is it food right here?
[204:05.88]Bagels?
[204:06.89]Bagged.
[204:07.31]Dammit.
[204:09.87]Just do it.
[204:30.28]Soon, we'll all be part of the change.
[204:33.64]Oh, God.
[204:38.54]Hey!
[204:39.85]You, uh... You alright?
[204:46.11]It wasn't supposed to go down like that.
[204:48.92]Sure.
[205:00.04]Are we fighting in the bathroom?
[205:00.98]It's perfect this way.
[205:03.64]So I'm on board now.
[205:06.61]It's the only way, man.
[205:09.15]What about TK?
[205:10.87]I'm a soldier for the cause, man.
[205:15.31]So it was you that started the outbreak.
[205:18.35]First, it was horrible.
[205:21.57]The zombies, the zombies we've been trying to save.
[205:26.81]Killing people.
[205:28.85]There's a person back there.
[205:32.69]Don't worry.
[205:34.13]Don't worry.
[205:35.39]Zoomer Santa's got this.
[205:56.76]I'm a soldier for the cause, Anne.
[206:06.11]No!
[206:06.83]This is not the way to help anyone.
[206:11.12]Oh, I see.
[206:13.44]You're losing the courage to do what needs to be done.
[206:19.52]Well, I have the guts, and I...
[206:27.02]Hey!
[206:29.51]Alright.
[206:30.47]Alright, boys.
[206:32.13]Sick him!
[206:34.63]Good.
[206:39.18]Good picture.
[206:40.16]Randolph's going to die.
[206:43.20]Wait, wait, wait.
[206:44.02]Everybody just swarm him.
[206:46.68]Watch out, watch out.
[207:01.59]What is he doing?
[207:13.49]Okay, so what did we learn?
[207:19.00]That I need to drop them off first because they're just bait
[207:34.49]He really is shaggy.
[207:35.57]Okay, this is... We're here.
[207:37.31]I got enough time to... He's not even using 10% of his power.
[207:45.95]So, on the way back... Okay, there's still a little bit of time.
[207:50.53]How are we doing on food?
[207:51.41]People good?
[207:53.09]What's the fastest way for me to get back?
[207:55.60]And can I grab anybody on the way back?
[207:59.24]Alright, so it looks like this...
[208:02.54]In industrial fashion.
[208:04.58]I don't think I can do this.
[208:06.49]I think I just have to go back.
[208:07.67]This is so far away.
[208:12.79]Look at how far... It's across the whole damn game.
[208:15.67]Alright, um... The fastest way is to just go through... Just bang a left.
[208:26.12]And just go across... Through the, uh, fortune park...
[208:37.35]Everybody has a weapon.
[208:39.52]Let's go.
[208:39.92]Let's just try to make it happen.
[208:43.28]Just stick together.
[208:44.04]Stay on the walls.
[208:47.96]Just hang onto the walls here.
[208:58.89]Good.
[208:59.13]Broad sword.
[208:59.63]Another one.
[209:00.57]Lucky.
[209:01.31]Let's go.
[209:06.72]Keep it up.
[209:10.36]Bang.
[209:10.70]Where the hell are we going?
[209:12.60]I gotta bang left.
[209:14.88]Why is it trying to get me to go this way?
[209:17.80]I gotta go left.
[209:22.18]We're good, right?
[209:30.76]Everyone's here?
[209:42.86]Food?
[209:44.80]Alright, I'm gonna take a hot dog.
[209:46.38]Anybody want hot dogs?
[209:47.52]Yeah, heal up.
[209:48.14]Hot dogs.
[209:48.58]There's like four of them.
[209:49.47]One of them's green.
[209:50.09]Alright, Randolph, hot dog.
[209:54.03]Take an extra hot dog for the road.
[209:59.35]Why are you throwing up?
[210:04.75]Is he still puking?
[210:14.05]It was poisoned.
[210:15.15]It was spoiled.
[210:15.81]Oh, okay.
[210:16.20]That makes sense.
[210:21.90]This is dangerous.
[210:23.28]We're gonna stay on the wall.
[210:32.05]Alright, alright, alright, alright, over here.
[210:41.57]Oh shit, Walter, you alright?
[210:45.94]You okay?
[210:50.60]You good?
[210:52.98]Shit, shit, shit!
[210:58.75]Take a hot dog, quick!
[211:03.53]I ate it!
[211:03.99]Go, go, go, go, go!
[211:11.84]Go, everything's fine!
[211:13.92]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[211:17.22]Go!
[211:17.40]Hurry up!
[211:24.76]Who needs it?
[211:25.14]Who needs it?
[211:26.08]Take it!
[211:28.26]No, thanks.
[211:28.76]You're gonna keep your trophy.
[211:30.44]Are you dumb?
[211:33.38]Oh, no!
[211:35.22]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[211:40.58]Don't run through him!
[211:42.88]Okay.
[211:45.48]Wait, there's a chef!
[211:49.02]There's a chef symbol!
[211:50.52]Chef symbol!
[211:51.12]Chef symbol!
[211:51.64]Chef symbol!
[211:52.78]Right here!
[212:02.74]Okay, where are we?
[212:04.54]Oh, fuck.
[212:09.19]I gotta go... We gotta go straight and left.
[212:15.45]There's no fucking way to get through this shit.
[212:17.25]Get a weapon?
[212:20.89]It's too late for that.
[212:22.52]Okay.
[212:38.35]Keep going keep going keep going it's fine Keep up move it Let's move
[213:08.26]The door was right there.
[213:09.66]I can't fucking... I just was too panicking because everyone was surrounded.
[213:27.06]I wish I could get the fucking car.
[213:29.28]And there's a snack machine right here.
[213:39.90]No, not you!
[213:41.08]I wanna give it to Royce!
[213:50.93]Just fucking kill me.
[213:56.11]This time, I'm gonna make sure I have them two weapons.
[214:01.62]You gotta bring these guys all the way back!
[214:10.53]My favorite part about this game is when I'm trying to die, nothing happens.
[214:15.28]Look at Walter.
[214:15.94]It just took him so long to die.
[214:18.36]But if I was actually playing this game, we're all dead instantly.
[214:23.40]Why does it always happen like that?
[214:25.86]Okay.
[214:32.09]So.
[214:39.61]Just make them wait.
[214:43.35]Make them wait.
[214:50.18]If I leave them here, they're not going to come with me.
[214:54.38]Alright, you won't put the trophy down.
[214:56.94]You've got that.
[214:57.50]That thing's stupid.
[214:58.42]Here, take the broadsword so it doesn't break.
[215:03.37]There's another broadsword coming up.
[215:05.25]Take the broadsword.
[215:06.97]Get rid of this stupid thing.
[215:09.54]Okay, get rid of this, too.
[215:10.64]What a waste.
[215:14.62]I need a weapon.
[215:15.55]I need a... What do you have?
[215:16.55]A spear?
[215:17.33]Just... Here, I'll trade you alcohol for a spear.
[215:22.99]I'm not gonna look.
[215:23.69]Okay.
[215:25.25]Let's see if I... I need to get a weapon.
[215:32.08]There is the... The stage is right here.
[215:33.92]Which is the broadsword.
[215:38.80]Get this shit quick.
[215:40.52]Get them both.
[215:42.56]Keep going.
[215:43.45]Before we get overwhelmed.
[215:44.81]Move, move, move.
[215:46.67]Alright.
[215:47.75]Now.
[215:50.75]Back here.
[215:52.41]Let's do it.
[215:58.55]So now he's gonna go turn right and go straight.
[216:04.31]Just keep running.
[216:09.21]Pretty good spot.
[216:17.92]Not a whole lot of zombies right here.
[216:21.68]Oh, come on.
[216:26.39]How the fuck did you get grabbed?
[216:28.27]Like, how?
[216:30.21]And how did you get out?
[216:31.89]Oh my god, what a joke.
[216:39.23]Anybody want a fucking hot dog?
[216:44.51]Remember this?
[216:47.95]Come on, give me the spear.
[216:56.44]Hit the spear.
[216:58.88]What are you doing over here?
[217:06.60]Why are you over here?
[217:09.89]Why did you go this way?
[217:24.80]Oh!
[217:25.02]He won't put it down!
[217:26.24]He won't put the fucking trophy down!
[217:30.40]Which item am I gonna pick?
[217:31.98]On the ground, in the thousand items that I put on there.
[217:35.75]He's already dead.
[217:40.99]At this point, I don't give a shit.
[217:43.06]Randolph is too far away.
[217:56.27]Okay.
[217:58.17]Why do I have to go across the whole fucking game?
[218:02.55]Why?
[218:03.03]And it's broken.
[218:06.57]Oh, this is a disaster.
[218:10.90]It's just a trillium zombie.
[218:19.04]Firebomb?
[218:22.02]I... This is fucking ridiculous.
[218:39.34]Alright, so half the comments say, just run.
[218:41.88]The other half say, stop running.
[218:45.06]Fight.
[218:46.86]What?
[218:48.26]Get in the car!
[218:51.93]Get in the car!
[218:52.69]Get in the back!
[218:55.65]Get in the car!
[219:27.59]He's alive!
[219:28.83]How the fuck are you alive?
[219:31.45]How are you alive?
[219:32.75]There's no way you're alive, man.
[219:39.00]There's no way.
[219:43.80]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[219:46.26]I can't fucking believe it.
[219:48.80]Are you serious?
[219:50.12]Follow me.
[220:03.86]So you're telling me that if I just run like this and just don't stop, they'll find a way to go through the zombies.
[220:20.11]But that doesn't make any sense because sometimes they do get caught.
[220:31.06]They just break free.
[220:37.54]It's not like the first game.
[220:40.00]I can't believe it.
[221:11.64]I can't believe it.
[221:16.93]You just have to run.
[221:21.31]And don't look at them.
[221:23.31]And they'll make it through.
[221:24.21]Thank you, man.
[221:39.93]He won the comedy trophy, but he didn't win his life.
[221:52.89]Okay, that's pretty awesome.
[221:55.31]Alright.
[221:55.91]I gotta do this case.
[221:57.19]I gotta save the game and do the case.
[222:10.25]I'm, like, trying to, like, keep up with them and give them weapons.
[222:12.78]No, just walk forward.
[222:28.66]Family kidneys, thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[222:30.41]Thank you.
[222:38.27]They say, hey Jerma, just got my first paycheck.
[222:39.90]Wanted to get back here after all the years of... Years of later?
[222:48.68]You've given me in many... Laughter!
[222:51.05]Laughter, okay.
[222:51.99]So much laughter you've given me and so many others.
[222:54.21]Love you, jermaHeart.
[222:54.95]Thanks a lot.
[222:55.37]First paycheck?
[222:55.79]Hope it was a big one.
[223:06.70]Wait!
[223:07.32]No, I don't have time for this.
[223:08.03]I have to go.
[223:08.47]And I told you I didn't want this to fucking happen, and it's gonna happen.
[223:10.67]And now I'm gonna get softlocked.
[223:12.97]That's what's gonna happen, isn't it?
[223:15.55]I'm gonna get softlocked onto case like 2-3.
[223:18.31]Right?
[223:18.49]I knew this was gonna fucking happen.
[223:30.98]Magazine.
[223:35.75]Oh, it's the books from the first one.
[223:39.29]Okay, so what is this?
[223:45.17]We'll lower the cost of items in the pawn shop by 10%, okay.
[223:49.21]I still need some bricks.
[223:54.72]Oh my god.
[223:59.26]Oh my god.
[224:07.19]Okay, um, hope I don't get softlocked.
[224:13.85]So we gotta go all the way down here.
[224:15.55]This is just done so wrong.
[224:20.08]I can go to the shop?
[224:20.76]Okay, yeah, it's 50,000, right?
[224:21.90]I need to get a wheelchair and just run.
[224:36.95]Price increases each time you buy it Get on it What am I stuck for?
[225:00.75]This is a boss.
[225:14.55]This is the boss.
[225:15.27]This is the guy.
[225:15.87]Uh-oh.
[225:24.58]I- I need to save it.
[225:26.50]I'm so fucked.
[225:31.15]Now what?
[225:42.30]Why is this happening?
[225:45.00]Hey!
[225:46.76]You get the hell away from my bike!
[225:51.22]Whoa, chill, okay?
[225:52.96]Sorry.
[225:54.44]Did they just run out of time to animate the person on his back, or is it dull?
[226:04.99]He's gonna get bit.
[226:26.92]More like this.
[226:27.70]Seems like a really cool character.
[226:31.24]I think I connect with this character more than Frank West.
[226:33.48]Really should have played the first and second one.
[226:56.37]I've got a daughter to protect.
[226:59.07]I won't let anything get in my way.
[227:01.99]Your daughter?
[227:03.39]Listen, I can take you both back to the safe house.
[227:10.54]Katie needs her Zombrex every 24 hours.
[227:14.48]You do?
[227:16.69]Right, baby?
[227:18.71]Oh, your daughter?
[227:27.73]Do you know what would happen if she didn't get her Zombrex every day?
[227:34.71]But I would never let that happen.
[227:37.45]We still have some time, Katie.
[227:39.43]I'll find some if it kills me.
[227:41.25]Hey, look.
[227:42.25]Let's get you and your daughter back to the safe house so... Don't touch my daughter!
[227:47.82]Get the hell away from her.
[227:50.96]You're just one of those nutbars.
[227:52.82]You just want to hurt her.
[228:05.52]I do like his bumblebee uniform.
[228:07.02]I don't have time for this.
[228:08.87]I don't have time for this.
[228:34.57]Oh shit, this is not good.
[228:36.49]I have to leave.
[228:43.06]Alright, it's a bye.
[228:45.38]Ooh, a key!
[228:46.50]I knew this was gonna fucking happen.
[229:02.49]Look at this.
[229:03.11]I don't have any weapons.
[229:04.09]I have no time.
[229:04.95]I don't know if this is gonna happen.
[229:07.39]Like an hour ago, I even said, I was like, I don't want this shit to happen again.
[229:11.07]And here we are.
[229:12.44]I need an axe.
[229:22.94]Give me this tomahawk.
[229:24.02]I just have to win.
[229:32.88]Okay, you can get hit by that.
[229:42.05]Thankfully it didn't do very much damage.
[229:50.95]Just win.
[229:52.27]Okay, I'm gonna try to just win.
[230:26.60]Wait, that's just a bottle of alcohol.
[230:33.50]Oh, what is it?
[230:40.61]Okay, what does he do here?
[230:41.43]What the fuck?
[230:50.73]I have no heals.
[231:23.06]Oh, no.
[231:24.72]No, no, no, no, no.
[231:27.30]So, I have day two at 326.
[231:44.40]I have day two at 208.
[231:57.29]Just tell your survivors to stand outside.
[231:59.35]Like, outside of here, you mean.
[232:11.42]But I still have to win.
[232:12.56]Alright, let's go.
[232:22.35]This thing's broken.
[232:23.07]This thing is stupid.
[232:25.19]This thing's worthless.
[232:26.27]I got the money.
[232:27.27]I had the money.
[232:30.68]Come with me, guys.
[232:35.26]Just go.
[232:35.90]Remember what everybody told me.
[232:37.94]They said you don't even have to look at them.
[232:40.08]Who cares?
[232:40.62]They'll just make it.
[232:41.58]That's what they told me.
[232:42.96]That's what they told me.
[232:46.69]Except when your hitbox is five times bigger than your body.
[232:49.67]Asshole.
[232:50.89]Okay, now we're just gonna go.
[232:54.17]We're doing case 2-2.
[232:58.61]Follow the arrow.
[233:01.08]Who's calling me?
[233:14.70]But I need food, though.
[233:15.66]I have to get, like, the pretzel.
[233:17.41]I have to eat a pretzel, and then I have to eat a hot dog and take a pretzel.
[233:20.01]Let's go.
[233:24.53]No, it's not my mother.
[233:25.29]My mother has a different ringtone.
[233:27.31]It goes... So I go, oh fuck, that's my mother.
[233:38.93]I didn't get any heals.
[233:44.54]I need fucking heals!
[233:48.30]I need heals!
[233:49.24]I need food!
[233:50.16]Did I walk by it?
[233:51.10]Where's the food?
[233:51.76]There's no food anywhere.
[234:01.41]Just defend that area.
[234:07.64]There we go.
[234:08.98]Okay, eat.
[234:09.76]Got a pretzel.
[234:14.60]Got a pretzel.
[234:18.45]Alright, you guys stay right here.

[234:23.77]So you don't get put in the cutscene.
[234:26.35]Okay, I'm going.
[234:40.56]Why am I doing forward at fucking R2s?

[235:22.54]Alright, kill him!
[235:29.31]Wait, I need to heal!
[235:30.39]I have to heal!
[235:31.11]I have to heal!
[235:32.05]They're blocking me in!
[235:51.35]Make them wait outside so they just die out there and then call them in and then get body blocked and then hit your face on the stall and break your neck and die.
[236:04.03]Have them go in the other bathroom?
[236:07.03]Oh, for the love of God.

[237:56.26]I'll be back.
[238:00.62]Get a 2x4.

[238:55.66]Damn it!
[239:03.23]What are you doing in here?
[239:10.65]What are you doing?
[239:11.97]Why are you in here?

[239:25.14]Ow, my chest.
[239:25.54]I pressed Y. I must have mashed.
[239:57.68]I was the guy on screen that was behind him, by the way.
[240:01.88]Urgent.
[240:03.22]What do I mean, urgent?
[240:05.06]They're all cheering like they did something.
[240:17.21]Alright, what if I save this so I don't get softlocked ever again?
[240:25.53]Okay, so we're gonna go far back, so like eight.
[240:28.31]So, yeah, one.
[240:32.65]They saved you.
[240:34.77]They did not do anything of the sort.
[240:40.25]Okay, now... I wanna give, um... Now we just have to make it out of here.
[240:45.76]Save the game.
[240:46.18]I already just did.
[240:47.22]Okay.
[240:48.30]Save it again.
[241:05.54]Okay.
[241:07.02]We need to find an ATM.
[241:08.10]You guys all have stuff?
[241:10.50]You guys all have weapons.
[241:11.40]Good.
[241:12.38]So let's go ahead.
[241:13.26]I got a lot of time to do this one.
[241:17.44]So.
[241:19.27]Fellas.
[241:20.37]What do you say we save somebody else?
[241:33.60]Oh, I need to get an ATM?
[241:35.60]Oh shit, there's money over here.
[241:37.70]Money case!
[241:42.82]Oh my god!
[241:43.92]Why was there a money case?
[241:49.49]In fact, you know what?
[241:50.03]Here, it's a heal.
[241:51.73]Who needs this?
[241:52.71]You do.
[241:56.95]Take this.
[242:03.26]I tried to take a fucking photo.
[242:05.37]Oh my god, it's not the same as the first game.
[242:07.29]I've got it burned in my brain.
[242:09.37]It's right trigger and then right bumper.
[242:12.19]That was a loud scream.
[242:13.69]Okay.
[242:14.75]Um...
[242:29.14]Industrial fashion.
[242:31.44]People like us.
[242:32.14]I'm going to end up having to do this again.
[242:36.74]Can I avoid this?
[242:37.54]Where's the pawn shop?
[242:38.24]Is there a pawn shop close?
[242:46.52]There's one right here.
[242:49.38]Is there one closer than that?
[242:52.47]Doesn't look like it.
[242:54.07]I guess I could go up this way.
[242:55.57]Right here.
[242:57.35]And then do this.
[243:01.64]I hope we don't run into whatever his name is there.
[243:04.80]Chuck.
[243:07.74]Alright, use the technique.
[243:17.97]Turn it off.
[243:29.42]Hey, remember just the run strategy?
[243:31.56]Remember the run strategy?
[243:34.66]Move it!
[243:37.66]Hey, I'm waiting on you!
[243:50.49]Let's move!
[243:51.55]Can we ride this?
[243:54.27]Royce is dead.
[243:55.07]Hank, keep up!
[243:55.91]Head over there!
[243:59.72]He didn't even get hit by it.
[244:04.84]Not bad.
[244:05.60]Stay there!
[244:30.51]Get away!
[244:51.62]Does anybody care if Royce is dead?
[244:53.77]I need that photo so bad.
[244:54.55]Same timeline, so it doesn't matter.
[244:56.67]Let's go, Walter.
[244:57.19]We gotta go.
[245:22.39]Walter's too far away.
[245:23.55]What?
[245:30.43]God damn it, Walter.
[245:50.57]Okay, let's fucking just... I gotta get out of this.
[245:55.39]Oh my god, Chuck!
[246:16.91]Just run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[246:20.19]I'm just bringing them back.
[246:21.86]Fuck it.
[246:24.92]Run, run, just run.
[246:29.60]Shit!
[246:50.24]Okay, I get to restart this shit.
[246:59.21]We lose that photo, but you can take a screenshot of it.
[247:01.99]I might be able to get all three of them to stand there.
[247:11.63]Where the hell was it?
[247:14.49]Which one was it?
[247:15.95]Two?
[247:16.39]One?
[247:22.56]Alright, everyone's fine.
[247:23.70]Let's go.
[247:24.38]I'm just gonna try to run and just forget it.
[247:26.69]I gotta bring these guys back.
[247:28.83]They're just dead.
[247:29.77]They're just dead meat.
[247:32.05]They actually are.
[247:37.17]Bring them back.
[247:42.15]Make sure I get the money.
[247:44.28]Get the money briefcase.
[247:48.90]Make it back.
[247:53.26]Good Okay
[248:22.58]Let's hustle it up!
[248:33.37]Go!
[248:33.79]Prepare for reentry in three, two, one.
[248:41.65]Head that way!
[248:42.41]Move it!
[248:42.91]There!
[248:45.07]You!
[248:45.41]Go there!
[248:46.33]Head over there!
[248:48.97]Ah!
[248:58.82]Get out of the way.
[249:11.09]What?
[249:11.41]He got hit by it.
[249:12.27]When?
[249:12.56]Oh, no.
[249:14.36]He's on the roof.
[249:29.46]I'm trying to get a photo.
[249:31.90]Okay, this is the one!
[249:39.75]Shit!
[249:49.90]Walter just got hit by it on his own.
[249:56.16]Does Walder keep getting hit by it?
[250:07.74]Why are you hitting each other?
[250:09.92]Walder, hurry up!
[250:11.42]WALDER!
[250:20.11]Walter!
[250:22.42]Oh, you idiot.
[250:24.94]Okay, move, please.
[250:27.72]Alright, now we'll make it back.
[250:36.20]Because I'm just gonna skip... Oh, how am I gonna do this?
[250:44.47]I have to... Can we... What if we go to the left?
[250:47.35]Will it trigger the cutscene still?
[250:53.53]Okay, cutscene hasn't triggered.
[251:15.86]What?
[251:16.16]Randolph?
[251:16.60]Why is Randolph getting killed?
[251:25.44]Okay, almost there.
[251:40.39]Why don't I heal them?
[251:45.83]You guys are contradicting yourselves every 10 seconds!
[251:50.57]Why are you not stopping and healing them?
[251:52.44]RUN!
[251:53.20]RUN QUICK!
[251:54.36]Why did Walter just take 5000 points of damage?
[252:14.56]You took him into a swarm of zombies.
[252:16.11]I thought that- Okay, they're doing something funny, but I don't have time to keep going.
[252:28.29]With 5,000 individuals that don't know how to play games?
[252:32.16]What are you talking about?
[252:37.10]This is for me.
[252:38.52]Not for them.
[252:38.94]Who did we lose?
[252:55.92]Whatever.
[252:56.20]I ain't going back.
[252:57.80]You made it.
[253:00.26]Dead at the finish line.
[253:05.04]Royce lives.
[253:31.45]Got you back in one piece.
[253:38.64]There's two zombies walking into a bar.
[253:41.44]You haven't heard this one, have you?
[253:45.84]Alright.
[253:47.34]40,000 pp.
[253:48.04]I would have gotten more, but... I had to walk these idiots across the whole damn game.
[253:55.57]Let me save.
[253:59.57]I had two people last time.
[254:06.18]Although, hold on.
[254:06.92]Let me be fair here for a second.
[254:09.54]I'm going to be really fair because I'm being very unfair.
[254:14.32]I tried to make them get hit by the pirate ship like five to ten times each.
[254:20.75]This is very unfair.
[254:24.01]So, that's a completely incorrect statement, what I just said.
[254:28.14]Like, I'm trying to get a photo of them dying.
[254:31.84]So, I killed them.
[254:35.14]Okay.
[254:35.26]Okay.
[254:42.01]I'm accepting my fault there.
[254:45.55]And the picture wasn't even very good.
[254:49.02]We're going to go right in the middle, just in case I get sad.
[255:05.24]Where's the picture viewer?
[255:08.22]Case file?
[255:09.44]No.
[255:19.77]The other one was so much better, unfortunately.
[255:22.33]It was so good.
[255:39.27]Oh, well.
[255:43.27]You can pull it from the stream.
[255:44.35]Yeah, you can.
[255:45.09]Alright, let me look at my combo cards.
[255:46.53]Okay, Machine Gun and Wheelchair.
[255:56.32]Alright.
[255:57.80]So, Case 3-1 has a lot of time.
[256:00.04]I need the Zombrex.
[256:02.86]Pawn Shop.
[256:04.76]Then there's also Industrial Fashion.
[256:08.22]Which, that's kind of far away.
[256:09.58]Tastes like chicken.
[256:10.45]I gotta get a better view of this.
[256:11.37]Let me get the Zombrex first.
[256:13.55]Put a waypoint.
[256:16.35]Check the moves.
[256:19.43]Okay, snapshot.
[256:22.72]Hold.
[256:23.34]Take a picture with your new buddies.
[256:24.62]Zombies.
[256:25.08]Hold.
[256:25.56]Right trigger and press right bumper.
[256:29.66]Is that a selfie?
[256:31.49]While the camera is out?
[256:35.82]Grab the head of a zombie and smash it into the floor.
[256:38.92]Otis would hate to have to clean this up.
[256:41.18]Hold the right trigger and then press B. So, wait, it's... Can't do it in here.
[256:45.88]Drama.
[256:50.50]Hey, rare Pepe body lotion.
[256:55.36]Thank you.
[256:57.42]For the five subs.
[256:59.50]Alright, let's get the map out.
[257:02.84]I'm gonna zoom this out.
[257:06.45]We need to go here.
[257:08.80]No.
[257:10.74]Pawn shop.
[257:12.74]There's a pawn shop.
[257:15.66]There's the closest one probably right here.
[257:19.54]Yeah, that's probably the closest one.
[257:20.96]Let's go.
[257:23.38]Move that axe.
[257:29.20]Isn't there orange juice and shit?
[257:30.24]Yeah, there is.
[257:37.64]Change outfit?
[257:39.64]Um, I'm not sure I can.
[257:44.03]I do have these moon shoes on, so I agree.
[257:46.89]It does look pretty stupid.
[257:49.93]Alright, I got it.
[257:50.59]Let's go.
[258:08.19]Okay.
[258:08.33]Oh, second floor, right here.
[258:09.49]Okay.
[258:15.95]Let's move.
[258:18.79]When do I get a health upgrade?
[258:24.87]Would you care what someone did?
[258:26.13]I have literally... I'm not going to read the rest of that.
[258:33.53]Well, I'll read the second part.
[258:36.08]What would somebody would do with your body in general after you're gone?
[258:39.80]Like, organ stuff?
[258:43.00]Yeah, if I, like, died and they, like, somebody needed my liver, then fucking take it.
[258:58.47]I gotta be dead, though.
[259:02.55]Would you get it when I was, like, alive?
[259:24.49]Okay, I have $57,000.
[259:25.65]I also need to find an ATM.
[259:28.25]What's up?
[259:31.71]I'm here to buy that Zombrex.
[259:34.59]It's your turn.
[259:38.09]That's a lot of money.
[259:43.18]Uh... What the fuck is going on?
[259:56.90]What is happening to me?
[259:58.36]Are they killing me?
[260:02.39]Wait, someone's running around.
[260:07.01]Where am I?
[260:07.73]I'm not in the vent.
[260:12.25]There are just bombs being thrown.
[260:29.92]Where am I?
[260:30.56]What the fuck?
[260:38.56]Why am I green?
[260:41.82]I'm turning into the Incredible Hulk.
[260:44.40]Give me a weapon!
[260:55.97]Give me a fucking weapon!
[261:06.08]Can I take a picture?
[261:09.30]What?
[261:11.38]Who is taking this photo?
[261:16.67]Wait, wait, wait, wait!
[261:17.77]Don't kill me!
[261:21.01]No, I'm trying to get the camera in the face the other way!
[261:29.31]What do I do now?
[261:40.84]Owned ass.
[261:51.69]Zoom in?
[261:52.19]I can't zoom in.
[262:04.53]Um...
[262:19.35]I'm outside.
[262:19.91]No I'm not.
[262:23.15]Turn left.
[262:25.53]Left some more.
[262:27.47]Left.
[262:27.73]Turn left a little bit more.
[262:35.86]Almost outside.
[262:36.50]I'm outside.
[262:53.88]I think I just jumped off the balcony.
[262:57.30]Awww.
[263:25.51]Do I have a checkpoint after buying the Zombrex?
[263:44.39]You didn't even get it?
[263:45.07]Yeah, I did.
[263:47.73]Okay, let's try this again.
[264:03.31]So, I'm trying to think of how that may have... What?
[264:06.85]I'm trying to think of how that may have happened.
[264:10.27]And the one thing I can think of is... When I bought the Zombrex at the same exact time... Somebody tried to grab me.
[264:19.18]And the game freaked out.
[264:20.96]One of those thieves tried to grab me.
[264:25.30]Right?
[264:26.88]Because that's what happens.
[264:27.90]Let's see what happens if we do this again.
[264:34.48]Because it was immediately right when I pressed the button.
[264:47.34]Some snacks.
[264:48.84]Alright.
[264:51.24]Up the stairs.
[264:53.29]Maybe it probably put me on the table that the Zombrex is on.
[264:56.49]That's also another good theory.
[264:59.29]ATMs, here we go.
[265:00.21]Alright, let's hope that doesn't happen again because I'm about to get money out of the ATM.
[265:08.92]40 grams.
[265:25.27]Okay.
[265:26.81]This time... Here we are.
[265:31.35]Just wait a second.
[265:32.19]Okay, here he comes.
[265:36.45]He made it in here much faster.
[265:38.23]Battle Axe?
[265:44.95]He's got one of those devices too.
[265:47.93]Another one.
[265:50.15]I'll take it.
[265:50.59]How many is he getting?
[266:00.26]Really?
[266:01.98]It was these three.
[266:05.89]Am I really that far away from him?
[266:12.19]Alright.
[266:13.23]So, um, I- That's what this does?!
[266:21.68]Item sto- You fucking asshole.
[266:29.04]What did he take?!
[266:29.88]Oh, gah!

[266:39.36]Leave me alone!
[266:40.09]Hi.
[266:40.15]Oh no!
[266:52.56]What is going on with this?
[267:04.69]And I can't change any weapons or anything.
[267:07.32]Go in the vent.
[267:14.30]Try a selfie.
[267:15.79]So it's right... Holding right trigger and then right bumper.
[267:25.16]Hmm.
[267:31.08]Save before buying?
[267:32.87]Go to the other store.
[267:34.87]How do you do a selfie?
[267:35.69]Is it left trigger, right trigger, right... No, it's right trigger, right bumper, right?
[267:45.70]Well, time to die again.
[267:47.30]Um...
[268:00.29]Do I have it?
[268:06.83]Do I have- do I- I don't have the Zombrax.
[268:08.41]It's just on the ground.
[268:13.94]Okay.
[268:20.14]Um, I'm afraid to buy anything else.
[268:24.78]The sports car key is a million dollars.
[268:31.29]Should I get a battleaxe?
[268:34.78]Servbot mask?
[268:36.26]No.
[268:36.82]Like, this is so bugged, I gotta get out of this.
[268:38.42]What time is it right now?
[268:41.88]It's 5 AM.
[268:43.73]Alright, industrial fashion, I might have time to do this.
[269:04.57]Save the game, yeah.
[269:06.59]That's also part of the plan.
[269:08.95]That's also part of the plan of the ATM.
[269:16.28]Watch out, there's evil people up there.
[269:21.16]ATM, okay.
[269:25.50]Bunch of more money.
[269:31.65]I could buy another one.
[269:34.56]Alright.
[269:35.14]Well, not yet.
[269:35.60]Let's see if I can do this.
[269:39.12]I gotta save the game, too.
[269:43.14]Let me eat some shit.
[269:44.82]Alright, save game.
[269:57.14]We're gonna go down, and then there's a save behind us.

[270:17.42]Really, please.
[270:43.03]Okay.
[270:43.63]Save.
[270:45.05]The game.
[270:50.11]I'm gonna end up triggering the cutscene.
[270:57.54]I don't want to fight him right now.
[270:58.52]I'm gonna lose.
[270:59.00]I mean, should I just fight him?
[271:04.82]I don't have anything... I got nothing to fight him with, though.
[271:10.65]I have money makers and a broken axe.
[271:16.39]Not with this attitude.
[271:18.32]Well, not with any attitude.
[271:30.68]Don't drink that orange juice, whatever you do.
[271:34.94]Oh, this is bad.
[271:49.38]Okay, just give me the knife.

[272:26.83]Well, I'm gonna have to beat him with a knife.
[272:30.35]This ain't gonna... This is not gonna happen.
[272:43.20]No way I'm gonna be able to do this.
[272:45.08]There's a maintenance firm right in front of me.
[272:49.55]I know I'm talking like I just got out of the dentist.
[272:51.21]I don't know why I'm doing this.
[272:54.75]Then there's a save point too.
[273:08.79]Ooh, is it possible if I make the Weed Whacker and just Weed Whack him?
[273:12.49]Maybe.

[273:31.90]Okay, so... Give me, uh, give me this.

[275:40.53]Where is it?
[275:41.35]Oh, it's right there!
[275:50.06]Don't even do it!
[275:50.52]Don't even need to do it!
[276:03.21]He's stuck, he's stuck.
[276:14.53]What?
[276:16.14]Oh my god, what the fuck?
[276:20.22]He's fucking glitched out.

[277:16.99]In the tree.
[277:17.31]In between the tree.
[277:19.67]This is the place.
[277:26.26]Get stuck in the tree.
[277:39.85]I gotta get him stuck in three.
[277:40.81]I need a better weapon.

[278:35.51]I got stuck right here.
[278:40.54]Okay, electric chair not gonna work.
[278:55.37]I'm putting the weed knives on.
[278:59.15]I'm gonna have shit back here.
[279:00.82]This thing doesn't work.
[279:12.30]I'm going to lock him.
[279:15.89]In that corner where the tree is.
[279:18.85]And then just weed whack the fuck out of him.
[279:23.43]Or, lawnmower?

[280:18.24]Why is it driving?
[280:19.48]Why is the car driving?
[280:22.12]That should not be happening.
[280:23.18]Alright, I got a bigger car than him.
[280:33.25]This might actually work out pretty well.
[280:35.11]Alright, where is he?
[280:54.70]What happened?
[280:55.28]OK, where's the Weed Whacker?
[280:57.52]Where's the Weed Whacker?
[281:06.39]Where's the Weed Whacker?
[281:15.51]There he is.
[281:26.02]Alright, let's do it.
[281:33.79]There's my spot.
[281:46.40]Bring him over here.
[281:48.92]Bait him into the tree.
[281:51.55]Get him stuck, and then we whack him.
[281:55.05]There he is.
[282:09.64]He has a lot of health.
[282:16.23]Oh fuck!
[282:17.09]Is he gone?
[282:25.33]What happened to the Weed Whacker?
[282:28.83]Did he break it?
[282:33.89]It turns off when you drop it, but it should be.
[282:42.99]Nobody gets in my way!
[283:02.67]Dude, that's a lot of damage if you just hold it.
[283:24.88]Die.
[283:25.02]Heal.

[284:09.47]New strategy is who cares.
[284:13.38]Combine two wheelchairs.
[284:17.20]Give me this rake.
[284:27.02]Get out of here.
[284:33.60]Rake and battery.
[284:43.06]Electric rake.
[284:47.82]It's a little stabbing motion.
[284:49.32]This might actually be pretty good.
[284:52.01]I just can't put it down.
[284:56.49]Just don't let it go.
[284:57.93]Let's see if I can do this.
[285:06.35]Go ahead, cutscene.
[285:14.34]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[285:19.08]I never put it down, except for when you have to lock him into the wall.
[285:24.07]Oh, yeah, baby.
[285:25.99]Oh, yeah, baby.
[285:28.17]Oh, yeah, baby.

[285:52.61]And there's a cooldown.
[285:53.39]There's a cooldown on how many times you can hit him.
[285:56.97]He's dead.
[285:57.63]I win.
[286:01.23]Did I get the bike?
[286:18.27]The rake is insane, by the way.
[286:22.99]Katie.
[286:24.77]Katie.
[286:28.07]Katie?
[286:30.57]Are you alright?
[286:35.98]Katie.
[286:38.26]You're okay.
[286:40.38]You're safe now.
[286:45.02]That's all that matters.
[286:57.37]It's not canon.
[287:02.02]Don't worry guys.
[287:08.16]I know everyone's pepe sad.
[287:29.34]Okay, this place is nuts.
[287:32.02]I swear I met that guy somewhere before.

[288:01.80]6.30.
[288:09.95]That's kind of cool.
[288:10.75]Alright, let me actually have to hold on to this.
[288:13.27]So, I'm going to need Zombrex.
[288:16.68]What else can I do?
[288:17.60]I need to save it, first of all.
[288:19.82]Go back to the maintenance shed.
[288:36.58]And I also, I'm going to go to the bathroom.
[288:39.42]I'm going to take a pee.
[288:42.25]I'm going to grab a water.
[288:44.05]I'll be back in two or three minutes.
[292:15.53]I came back and looked at chat at the perfect time.
[292:21.15]Oh, you guys are fucking hilarious.
[292:23.37]Somebody said, this is what it sounds like when 500 people are sleeping at the same time in the same, like, huge room.
[292:36.61]That's really funny.
[292:41.29]And we're back.
[292:43.77]So what did I want to do?
[292:44.53]I wanted to... Got the game saved.
[292:47.17]Let's go back and just make sure I got cool weapons.
[292:52.63]What's this?
[292:54.74]I gotta start three.
[292:55.70]Let me look at the cases.
[292:57.64]Because I might be in trouble.
[293:00.92]Alright, there's two parts to case three.
[293:02.90]So I've got to get it started.
[293:08.56]I'm good to go.
[293:09.98]Chef's knife.
[293:11.18]Now, let's move.
[293:16.21]I got the electric chair.
[293:18.41]Ooh, but I... Yeah, I need to... I gotta dump it.
[293:20.35]I've gotta dump it.
[293:20.99]I've gotta use it.
[293:23.24]Alright.
[293:28.96]I'm gonna... How far away is one spittin'?
[293:32.78]Not that far.
[293:35.07]Let's try it.
[293:49.66]Am I shocking this guy?
[293:51.82]Oh yeah, absolutely.
[293:59.60]It's kind of very, very, very loud.
[294:03.14]Let me fix that.
[294:12.90]Better.
[294:20.20]Alright, it's done.
[294:21.50]ATM.
[294:24.74]ATM.
[294:25.30]There they are.
[294:25.88]A-T-M.
[294:26.34]$129,000.
[294:26.40]Alright, hopefully I don't need any weapons for this one.
[294:51.37]Rocket fireworks?
[294:52.29]Cool.
[294:53.55]What do these do?
[294:57.02]Holy shit.
[294:57.76]I gotta take the Zombrex.
[295:17.76]Here, just... get started.
[295:19.50]What's this?
[295:20.74]Fortune!
[295:21.78]Did that money, hacker?
[295:22.88]Finally, some good fucking food!
[295:47.37]Alright, get away from me!
[295:49.63]What just happened?
[295:50.65]I want to do this, like, two more times.
[296:06.72]Felines have a taste of meat.
[296:08.00]Make sure it's not what they eat.
[296:11.92]Felines... are eating meat.
[296:16.92]One more.
[296:19.80]Playing in the sand can unearth wonderful treasures.
[296:23.60]Okay.
[296:25.46]Any others?
[296:25.84]Alright, there's probably just one for five grand, definitely.
[296:36.30]Your prestige is growing.
[296:38.65]I see good things ahead of you.
[296:40.71]Five thousand.
[296:42.05]Any more?
[296:42.39]There's another one?
[296:52.93]That's a lot of money.
[296:55.55]People you help in life can help you in return.
[296:57.49]Ask them.
[297:04.88]In dark times, a bright heart is required.
[297:06.32]Heroes show the way.
[297:15.36]Always borrow money from a pessimist.
[297:16.84]He won't expect it back.
[297:25.66]When was the last time I saved the game?
[297:29.80]I was assuming I was gonna get like 50,000p or something.
[297:36.36]I saved it.
[297:36.86]Okay, let me see what the next one is.
[297:39.50]You're prestigious in your actions, great and small.
[297:42.92]Alright, that's a lot, but how much is the next one? 50,000.
[297:56.11]That's not worth doing.
[297:59.33]Somebody kill me.
[298:00.21]Uh, checkpoint is safe here.
[298:04.15]Um...
[298:29.83]638.
[298:31.47]Checkpoint?
[298:31.89]Is the checkpoint further in?
[298:39.96]I don't know.
[298:42.94]No, it's not.
[298:43.82]Okay, we're good.
[298:53.21]What have I happened to?
[298:53.85]Where's the... Where is it?
[298:56.19]Wasn't it just right here?
[299:00.01]Didn't I make something?
[299:04.49]Just keep the Wraith.
[299:05.33]Uh, can I do, like, Battery and Knife?
[299:15.50]No.
[299:20.48]I guess I'm just gonna keep the- I'll keep the Wraith.
[299:23.14]2x4 on Lawnmower?
[299:23.84]Yeah, I've already seen what it does.
[299:25.12]Let's go.
[299:27.78]I'll just keep the Wraith.
[299:34.60]I'll probably get some good money.
[299:37.77]Let's farm kills here.
[299:46.92]There's an ATM's belt.
[299:50.60]No, I didn't want to lose that.
[300:15.42]Well, now it's actually broken.
[300:16.42]Alright, let's go.
[300:17.18]Can I just jump into this guy's arms?
[300:27.59]It's like this motherfucker was waiting for me.
[300:29.57]He was waiting for me to jump into him.
[300:35.09]Okay.
[300:44.08]Get out of the way.
[300:53.28]Alright, take the Zombrex.
[300:57.40]Alright, ATMs.
[301:01.24]I wanted to go... Oh fuck, I was gonna do this first.
[301:05.72]Shit, I thought it was already on it.
[301:07.52]But I had to go back and save it.
[301:11.52]Shit.
[301:17.03]Shit!
[301:17.83]Kill me.
[301:19.19]Kill me.
[301:20.09]Yeah, I wanna... I... I took too much damage.
[301:25.63]Shit, just kill me.
[301:31.11]Okay, it wasn't selected on my watch.
[301:34.99]Because I had to go back.
[301:39.01]Damn it.
[301:39.69]Whatever.
[301:51.88]Okay.
[301:53.70]So.
[301:54.97]Once bitten, help the wounded man.
[301:56.61]Pub of Gold.
[301:57.21]A bleeding man has managed to find temporary safety in Pub of Gold in the Silver Strip.
[302:06.31]That's where we're going.
[302:13.58]We're going to go there fast.
[302:15.02]I know people are going to say, but what about...
[302:34.67]Up, up, up, up, up.
[302:35.57]Silver strip.
[302:38.57]Once bitten.
[302:40.63]Where are you?
[302:41.23]I think I passed an ATM, but there'll be others.
[302:53.54]Like right there.
[302:57.48]What's the matter with this thing?
[303:02.02]I'll take a handgun.
[303:16.39]Okay, give.
[303:21.17]Give, give, give, give.
[303:24.38]Money.
[303:25.84]$129,000.
[303:26.04]Very good.
[303:26.44]I was gonna say very not good, but very good.
[303:31.34]Beer.
[303:48.63]Frank needs Zombrex.
[303:49.71]Yes, he does.
[303:50.47]Alright, let's go.
[303:52.58]I got a gun.
[303:53.76]I'm just gonna bring this.
[304:06.95]Hey!
[304:09.13]Hey, buddy, you okay?
[304:10.79]No, no, dude, not so much.
[304:12.23]I just came here to party and look what happened.
[304:16.94]You're bleeding pretty bad.
[304:17.70]Did one of those things get you?
[304:18.76]Yeah, man, I'm... I'm bitten, man.
[304:23.26]Like a tasty morsel on the hose.
[304:24.51]If I don't get Zombrex soon, game over.
[304:27.41]It's game over for me.
[304:31.69]Really?
[304:32.53]Why won't you die?
[304:34.95]You pit... So, did you find some Zombrex?
[304:42.38]Yeah, I did.
[304:57.81]Good luck.
[305:12.02]Okay, I can't do that one.
[305:15.38]I need Zombrix to do that one.
[305:19.34]So, there's Taste Like Chicken, which is a little bit further up.
[305:22.34]Let's try this.
[305:35.57]Save him.
[305:36.89]That's asking a lot.
[305:40.15]I know it's save the people, save the people, but... That's asking a lot to give a Zombrex to somebody.
[305:53.88]What do I get from that person?
[305:55.36]10,000 PP for bringing him back?
[305:57.34]I don't... whatever.
[306:03.09]Really?
[306:04.22]Oh, that attack.
[306:10.48]That's angering me.
[306:12.68]Alright, what's the save point?
[306:17.94]There's one... One kind of behind me over here.
[306:26.15]That... Oh.
[306:27.79]My.
[306:28.23]God.
[306:29.13]That's a big slot machine.
[306:33.55]That's a huge one.
[306:34.51]Alright, I'll be back.
[306:35.56]I gotta look at that money I got.
[306:36.82]I gotta save the game.
[306:38.80]Uh, it's... Uh... Okay, just... I'm kind of freaking out right now.
[306:44.78]I can't climb over that.
[306:45.48]Did I just hit my mouth?
[306:58.39]What the fuck was...
[307:06.06]Jesus!
[307:14.34]What's that?
[307:14.82]A UFO?
[307:17.56]Spaceship toy.
[307:19.54]There's a maintenance room down here.
[307:26.53]Jewels and... Ooh, hold on.
[307:29.39]How about... Alright, just get rid of this thing.
[307:38.15]Leaf blower and jewels.
[307:39.69]This is going to be radical.
[307:54.20]Am I going to make the pyromania update gun?
[307:57.30]Is this going to shoot bubbles?
[308:01.06]So, is it... Oh, fuck.
[308:03.10]I didn't want to turn it on.
[308:05.12]No, put it down.
[308:05.52]I don't know.
[308:06.00]It's dangerous.
[308:07.18]Okay, what about...
[308:10.25]Knife?
[308:10.87]Okay, I can do Molotov.
[308:21.32]Okay.
[308:23.88]I'll just take the toy just in case I need it for anything.
[308:26.64]You can't?
[308:27.48]Well, let me just at least see what it does.
[308:28.94]I mean, that's fun.
[308:34.21]But who cares?
[308:35.05]Gemblower.
[308:46.68]Absolutely.
[308:49.64]Give me the Zelda sword.
[308:57.54]Okay.
[309:01.93]What's up there?
[309:05.47]Oh shit, what is this?
[309:06.87]Alien probe?
[309:12.11]What is all this stuff?
[309:17.17]Ray gun?
[309:18.23]Alien head?
[309:18.99]Does this actually hurt things?
[309:26.68]Uh, I want alien probe.
[309:32.86]Drink the beer.
[309:33.42]I see someone hiding in the elevators in the hotel.
[309:39.36]What happened to my leaf blower?
[309:41.22]Where's my leaf blower?
[309:57.71]Alright, I gotta, let's move.
[310:01.41]Okay, I've got alien probe, alien head.
[310:03.47]Is there anything else in here?
[310:05.59]There was like a katana right here.
[310:07.91]Oh, fuck.
[310:14.07]Give me the katana.
[310:15.78]Okay.
[310:17.10]No, I need to, two hands?
[310:18.30]Shit.
[310:20.66]Shit.
[310:27.45]Hold on.
[310:28.01]Um... What do these stairs do?
[310:38.76]Nothing.
[310:39.96]I can combine the katana with something.
[310:46.33]Alright.
[310:47.23]I'm gonna replace the gun.
[310:50.97]Got it.
[310:51.46]Alright.
[310:52.18]Let's go.
[310:56.73]Alien head, alien head, alien head.
[310:58.90]What?
[310:59.96]Alien head and gems?
[311:01.13]I don't have any gems.
[317:03.38]And it goes... I'm gonna save this in a different slot so I don't fuck myself.
[317:09.06]Uh, 8.30 AM.
[317:09.30]Let's do the one that's at... 6.
[317:35.66]Facecam?
[317:36.18]Yeah, sure.
[317:37.59]Alright, I gotta go.
[317:41.21]Now.
[317:42.15]See, I told you I was gonna be in trouble if I didn't do this now.
[317:45.41]And that's far away.
[317:49.17]Far away.
[317:59.22]Incoming softlock.
[318:06.35]I spent so long just sitting down in my chair with my feet in the air.
[318:14.65]Was that zombie food?
[318:15.93]Okay, I thought you could eat them.
[318:24.17]I should be fine.
[318:30.31]Oh, they're turning into super zombies now.
[318:38.29]Hey, I remember you.
[318:42.47]Up in smoke!
[318:55.88]It's not gonna work.
[318:57.26]They're different.
[319:03.65]Six of the same guy.
[319:14.25]Checkpoint!
[319:21.74]Let's go!
[319:24.74]Let's go!
[319:31.33]I feel like this main character gets fatter every cutscene.
[319:40.42]Can we talk about that for just a second, though?
[319:45.15]Back in 2006, 2005, maybe.
[319:48.19]When did, like, San Andreas come out?
[319:54.33]Even Red Dead Redemption 2 did not really do that good of a job.
[319:57.41]What if it happened to when you eat too much food, you get fat?
[320:00.73]Or if you don't eat enough, you get really skinny?
[320:02.40]They lost that somewhere along the way.
[320:16.54]What game had that?
[320:17.48]San Andreas, like, one of the greatest games ever.
[320:22.12]And then... Fable!
[320:32.39]Yeah, Fable had this shit.
[320:33.87]What is going on right now?
[320:35.33]Keep the grip, man.
[320:40.06]How many bits will it take for me to do... for you to do a full beatbox?
[320:59.04]That was pretty good.
[321:05.58]I'm pretty good at it, I think.
[321:09.64]I'm just doing Doug transitions.
[321:17.34]Alright, I kind of need food, and I also need a save point.
[321:26.98]This is so far away.
[321:29.98]What on Earth is going on here?
[321:31.70]Save point, please.
[321:33.57]But, fuck.
[321:35.55]This is kind of... Alright, fish.
[321:38.53]I have to use it.
[321:45.83]Get alright.
[321:47.87]Alright.
[321:48.13]Alright.
[321:48.47]Alright.
[321:48.79]Alright.
[321:49.07]Alright.
[321:49.35]Alright.
[321:49.67]Alright.
[321:50.01]Alright.
[321:50.39]Just get out of the Where are you even coming from just put I need to eat this fish I
[322:13.25]This... The probe thing sucks.
[322:15.33]Give me my Gem Blower.
[322:16.25]Come on, E-Case.
[322:22.14]No.
[322:22.72]Just go.
[322:27.76]It's blinking now.
[322:31.95]And whatever is in here, I probably have to kill before the time runs out.
[322:34.35]So just get over here and use your Gem Shotgun.
[322:41.98]I gotta just do it one and done.
[322:43.34]I gotta win.
[322:44.63]There's no save point, right?
[322:45.71]I gotta just do it one and done.
[322:46.91]Just don't lose.
[322:53.69]Jared is dead.
[322:55.71]Who the hell is Jared?
[323:06.58]Stop dropping the...
[323:10.79]Oh, what a pain in the ass.
[323:18.91]Whoops, I let go of it.
[323:21.13]Don't let go of it.
[323:22.91]Somebody touched me.
[323:24.95]Okay?
[323:25.63]Just hold on to it.
[323:26.61]I need to eat something, too.
[323:36.76]Alright, no save point here.
[323:38.46]Fuck.
[323:45.90]There's such cool shit over here.
[323:50.04]I do have a fish.
[323:53.69]Alright, here we go.
[323:55.43]Do I have enough time to even eat anything?
[323:57.93]I'll try.
[323:58.37]Alright, drink another thing.
[324:04.59]Alright, now, I have the Gem Blower, which is the best item in the game, which is what, like, this, what, 10, 20,000 people watching?
[324:13.59]At least 10,000 people told me that this is the best item in the game.
[324:23.84]And I'm talking about over the course of the whole stream.
[324:25.52]Not, like, right now.
[324:26.40]At least people cycle in and out over the course of the stream.
[324:29.30]30,000 people have been here already.
[324:31.78]I got that in analytics.
[324:40.03]Why am I going underground?
[324:42.67]Oh, goddammit, this is bad.
[324:44.67]Every time.
[324:46.47]Every single goddamn time.
[324:50.52]Whatever it is, kill it instantly.
[324:52.08]I'm gonna lose.
[324:53.90]I don't have enough time for this.
[324:54.68]I'm gonna have to go back to... No, this is not gonna work.
[325:19.04]TK, what are you up to?
[325:22.69]Hey, my man.
[325:24.79]Make sure you get all of this handled correctly.
[325:26.99]We don't need no damage.
[325:28.85]Take care of this stuff over here, because we're leaving in a few.
[325:34.23]Time to take some pictures.
[325:38.34]This is a picture mission?
[325:39.36]Or is this not even a boss fight?
[325:43.02]Whatever this is, I'll need evidence.
[325:49.71]It's over.
[325:59.78]I needed like five to ten full minutes to do this mission.
[326:18.39]How can I not jump?
[326:30.92]Maybe it'll just play out and you'll be done.
[326:37.62]Hurry up!
[326:39.04]You guys, this is so slow.
[326:40.10]Just get it into the truck so I can be done with this mission.
[326:50.39]What?
[326:52.01]Yeah, please leave.
[326:52.97]So then I can finish this mission.
[326:55.49]Case 3-2 completed.
[326:56.33]Case 3-4-1 begin.
[327:22.21]Yeah, well, I needed way more fucking time for this.
[327:50.72]No!
[327:51.68]I gotta go so far back.
[328:06.71]It's 3-1, 3-2, 9 AM.
[328:18.33]I gotta do day 2 at like 8.30.
[328:20.54]$135,000, so day 2, 8.30, I'm just getting right on that.
[328:27.42]Let's see if this does it.
[328:28.90]I'm gonna try.
[328:32.91]Good thing I have one that's like 40 minutes long.
[328:48.15]Let's see if I can get there from here.
[328:50.40]I'm going to lose all my cool weapons.
[328:53.28]Alright, no, I got some time here.
[328:57.88]Just let's go.
[328:59.02]Hurry.
[329:14.23]Don't dick around.
[329:14.95]Yeah, no dicking around.
[329:15.85]I'm just going to get there and I should have enough time.
[329:18.66]There's a pineapple up there.
[329:19.60]I'm not going to touch it.
[329:21.66]That's taking a lot of strength.
[329:23.86]So is not touching the suit that's right there.
[329:26.97]Or playing that slot machine.
[329:28.91]Or picking up that money.
[329:30.43]Alright, let's go.
[330:03.70]Let's just go right in the door and then run right back out.
[330:06.73]I might need to get, uh, transportation too.
[330:09.07]Of course, of course you just grab it, right?
[330:12.27]Like, where's the fucking anti-grab goo?
[330:14.01]Just jump.
[330:20.56]Oh, that's infuriating to me.
[330:22.52]I am going to scream.
[330:23.74]I just, I'm going to scream.
[330:42.73]Even with that much time, that's like a full... I would be comfortable driving my car with that much gas in it.
[330:48.25]Like, I can't even... I can't get all back there from here.
[330:52.67]I definitely can.
[330:53.35]Let's go.
[331:13.27]Don't save it.
[331:14.52]Yeah, actually, save it.
[331:15.76]No, don't save it.
[331:16.42]We're good.
[331:38.05]Frank, there's somebody... Hey, can I eat that zombie?
[331:42.93]No, I didn't even do it this time.
[331:53.08]There was so much less time, I think, by this point.
[332:01.38]Alright, let's see.
[332:02.50]Just run.
[332:03.80]Quick.
[332:04.70]If I see a shopping cart, it's game over for me.
[332:06.78]I'm gonna win.
[332:24.45]Fuck it.
[332:24.71]I don't care.
[332:25.27]Leave it.
[332:25.97]Leave the damn thing.
[332:30.25]I am not slower because of the leaf blower.
[332:34.60]But it don't matter.
[332:35.24]It don't matter because here we go.
[332:36.34]Gimme that.
[332:52.07]Gimme that.
[332:52.49]Gimme that.
[332:55.61]Give me that.
[332:56.99]Oh my god, Frank.
[332:59.51]Why would you let it go?
[333:01.29]There's no reason to let this go.
[333:03.39]This might be enough time.
[333:25.09]I just need a heal.
[333:26.25]Oh my god, that is so murder.
[333:29.81]I hit the lip.
[333:30.67]STOP!
[333:33.00]No, you ram over that damn thing!
[333:34.82]You run over it!
[333:35.64]You ram over it!
[333:36.64]I already have fucking no health for this shit.
[333:45.58]Get off of the wheelchair!
[333:48.38]Get off of the wheelchair!
[333:49.85]I wanna go in!
[333:51.89]I wanna go in the door!
[334:10.24]I can't believe I can't go!
[334:12.46]Oh god!
[334:14.98]It's alright, it's okay.
[334:17.54]Wolf, you hear my teeth?
[334:18.75]You hear my teeth?
[334:19.35]They're just squished together.
[334:24.40]You're asking, what are you doing in here, Jeremy?
[334:26.10]Because I have to heal before I do this mission.
[334:29.64]And I've got one heal.
[334:31.74]I'm going to go over here, and I'm going to get these other ones.
[334:34.14]Over here, there's a whiskey bottle.
[334:36.04]I'm going to drink it.
[334:38.14]And now I've got full health.
[334:39.12]Let's get back to business, please.
[334:41.81]Okay, thank you.
[334:44.43]I still have plenty of time.
[334:45.73]This is going to be just fine.
[334:47.07]Oh, the teeth are out tonight.
[335:18.18]I'm here with way more time.
[335:22.98]I had, what, like half of this last time?
[335:25.06]I think it's still doable.
[335:26.06]I just can't fuck up this train part.
[335:28.76]And I don't have any saves.
[335:30.38]So I can't mess it up.
[335:31.50]And if I mess it up again, then, well... Remember what happened last time when I was up against the clock and it was for the motorcycle person?
[335:40.51]I'm gonna have to have the optimal 100% impossible to fuck up route.
[335:45.67]Like, for tomorrow.
[335:56.04]Okay, go.
[336:06.69]It's still kind of doable.
[336:12.93]Is there a shortcut in this game?
[336:15.57]Or do they just want you to run straight?
[336:18.51]That person is running on screen.
[336:27.34]Alright.
[336:37.19]Save time.
[336:41.61]Oh shit!
[336:49.54]Which is the one?
[336:50.08]This is the safe one.
[336:51.24]This is 6 AM.
[336:52.32]This is 9 AM.
[336:52.68]Day 2.
[336:55.22]Uh, 830.
[336:55.66]This is the safe one.
[336:56.82]This is a really safe one.
[336:58.08]It has to be three.
[337:12.75]Jerma, why can't you just use the emulator to save?
[337:15.61]Um, I'm emulating an Xbox 360 controller.
[337:19.71]Not the game.
[337:20.89]I wish I could.
[337:22.31]Take a photo.
[337:24.67]Eat this.
[337:28.91]Okay.
[337:35.99]Just run in, just run in!
[337:38.65]Oh, fuck!
[337:39.75]Wow!
[337:41.57]Here we go!
[337:57.88]Jared is dead.
[338:08.29]No!
[338:10.09]No, give me the gun!
[338:11.55]Give me the gun, please!
[338:12.49]I have to die, everyone.
[338:18.71]Ah!
[338:27.12]There is definitely a story.
[339:00.26]Oh my god, give me a break.
[339:02.24]I have to shoot him with the stupid...
[339:30.70]By the way, why do I have this?
[339:32.58]It's so bad!
[339:33.56]It's a nerf gun!
[339:35.44]I thought it was an alien laser!
[339:52.36]No, not the alien!
[340:12.27]Oh my god, there's a million people!
[340:14.81]Holy shit, what happened?
[340:16.53]What is going on in this game?
[340:21.86]There's food?
[340:25.04]There's food.
[340:25.80]Okay, I'm going too fast.
[340:35.22]The yellow squares are your health.
[340:38.47]Alright.
[340:39.37]I just... Is that what it is?
[340:41.57]I have absolutely no clue.
[340:43.29]I have no idea.
[341:15.09]Where's the food?
[341:16.36]Onion rings!
[341:28.94]Pick up!
[341:29.74]Oh, I don't know what the jelly means, Mrs. Home Alone!
[341:34.98]Let's do a bullet snack on him.
[341:42.27]What is that?
[341:43.19]Why is this guy made out of wood?
[342:07.78]Okay.
[342:08.34]Did I do it?
[342:19.61]What the hell are you up to, TK?
[342:22.25]Just enjoying the land of opportunity, Frankie.
[342:26.37]You paid Cure to start the outbreak, didn't you?
[342:29.53]No need to dwell on the details when we all come out ahead.
[342:33.98]come out ahead what the hell thousands of people are dead you're not gonna get away with it oh come off it Frank I brought you back in the public eye don't I even get a thank you right between the eyes it's okay I'm actually really glad that they disconnect there because that means that the case is over
[343:04.58]If I had to actually climb up there and fight him with four minutes to fail the case, I'd be very, very upset.
[343:14.45]Frank, it's Stacy.
[343:16.35]Are you okay?
[343:17.99]Same as ever.
[343:19.97]Are you alright?
[343:21.55]I've been better.
[343:23.21]What's going on?
[343:23.85]That bastard TK tried to take me out.
[343:27.03]He survived the outbreak?
[343:30.13]Yeah, unfortunately.
[343:31.28]And it looks like he's up to something.
[343:34.91]I didn't take a picture of a bad ending.
[343:39.17]Is that real?
[343:40.19]Maintenance key, thank god.
[344:09.47]Case done.
[344:11.61]Thank goodness.
[344:13.79]September 26th at 1pm.
[344:15.57]Plenty of time.
[344:16.19]Okay.
[344:19.24]The next case is at 1pm.
[344:39.24]So now... I'm gonna hold on to this assault rifle.
[344:44.70]Let's take a quick look at what's over here.
[344:46.70]There's a maintenance room.
[344:50.70]It's already yellow.
[344:51.96]I know.
[344:52.82]That means I have to go do it.
[344:55.59]Alright, what we got?
[344:56.55]We got a saw... a saw gun.
[345:00.47]Plates?
[345:02.57]There's a vacuum... Okay, plates and saws?
[345:06.95]No.
[345:07.43]Plates and... Shoot saws out?
[345:13.58]Shoot plates out.
[345:14.40]Why would I do this?
[345:20.26]This seems way worse than shooting saw blades.
[345:26.75]Plate launcher.
[345:34.28]Vacuum cleaner?
[345:38.50]It's a shark tank.
[345:55.81]I have this thing that shoots plates out!
[345:58.80]This thing looks crazy.
[346:04.02]The X-San- I can't even read that.
[346:13.66]Well, I'm gonna keep the alien head.
[346:16.52]But this thing can go away.
[346:17.68]This looks insane.
[346:20.42]You can also do saw and saw blade.
[346:22.46]Yeah.
[346:24.16]Alright, cool.
[346:24.76]I'm gonna use this.
[346:28.96]Yeah, this is a Bloodborne weapon.
[346:31.70]That's why I'm using it.
[346:33.08]What about sledgehammer and blade?
[346:34.96]No.
[346:36.42]Alright, let's just do the case.
[346:40.39]Alright, fastest way.
[346:41.15]I got a maintenance key now.
[346:46.45]Should I get in the car?
[346:48.61]So, will this direct me towards maintenance doors?
[346:53.42]Or no?
[347:00.32]Yes.
[347:01.80]So, I should be going this way.
[347:03.60]So, I need to get in that car.
[347:05.18]Alright, I'm going to store this.
[347:15.14]I don't think I can put... Can I not... I don't want to lose the fucking saw.
[347:23.54]It's okay, I can walk.
[347:40.35]You have the alien mask, you're fine.
[347:49.59]I don't want to use this until I need it.
[347:50.89]No, it's right here.
[348:03.32]I'm fine.
[348:05.38]Case 4-1, we're good.
[348:18.34]There's a motorcycle up there, too.
[348:21.74]Oh, that's so cool.
[348:25.14]How many heals?
[348:29.91]Get rid of this thing.
[348:30.63]Okay, um... I need to pick up... Shit, no.
[348:40.99]I need the beer.
[348:42.80]No, I don't.
[348:43.44]Just drink it.
[348:43.96]Okay.
[348:48.20]Uranus zone.
[348:50.08]That's not where I want to go.
[348:50.87]I want to go up.
[349:06.45]Two.
[349:08.70]Where is this taking me?
[349:11.76]Am I wasting time on purpose?
[349:13.94]No, I'm just following the arrow.
[349:17.56]Uh, I didn't want to get in the car.
[349:18.64]I just made this thing.
[349:20.59]I didn't want to lose it in the car.
[349:26.79]That's such a waste.
[349:27.57]Yeah, I'm going to make this cool new item.
[349:29.31]Throw it on the ground behind you.
[349:30.71]Get in the car.
[349:37.92]Alright, we're almost there.
[349:44.65]And I would not have found that, would I?
[349:49.33]So, there it is.
[349:56.55]Don't need to go hunting for that.
[349:59.69]Maintenance room.
[350:01.49]Let's test it on this guy.
[350:04.85]Pretty damn good.
[350:10.70]What?
[350:11.84]is escape pod.
[350:15.30]Okay, um... Amplifier and escape pod?
[350:26.65]No.
[350:27.31]Amplifier and... And the alien head?
[350:36.41]No.
[350:36.91]What about the fire extinguisher?
[350:39.98]Ooh, shit.
[350:44.58]The cryopod.
[350:50.26]I have to carry this around.
[350:52.68]I don't want to carry this around.
[350:56.82]This is like a giant... Look.
[351:00.66]Okay.
[351:01.18]This is the firework that you light at the very end.
[351:04.22]This is the one that's going to be huge and awesome.
[351:06.37]Everyone's going to sit there and watch for five straight minutes.
[351:08.35]I have to bring this.
[351:24.91]I'm gonna go in a very, very dense area.
[351:30.43]I need the most amount of people to see what I'm doing.
[351:34.05]Not here.
[351:40.96]Okay.
[351:45.94]I'm gonna put it in display... Right over here.
[351:49.98]Let's see what happens.
[351:50.67]That... Okay, now what?
[351:57.39]We don't even get to see the fun thing because... We don't even get to see how cool it looks.
[352:03.75]What is it doing?
[352:04.47]Oh, it just floats around and... Oh, what a waste.
[352:15.25]I think this thing sucks!
[352:19.05]It doesn't even keep frozen!
[352:23.89]What a disappointment that was.
[352:25.27]I'm not buying that one again.
[352:26.49]Alright, let me go this way.
[352:46.01]Still got a way to go.
[352:46.95]Uhhhhhhh.
[352:51.44]This is a bathroom.
[352:56.38]Wait.
[353:00.36]What is up here?
[353:06.69]So this is the final area.
[353:16.70]Where is it?
[353:19.88]Briefcase?
[353:24.49]Pan?
[353:25.17]There's bacon in here.
[353:29.09]Very cool.
[353:29.53]Alright, what about this?
[353:31.75]Toy helicopter.
[353:38.67]This is... cool.
[353:40.65]Alright, let's go back.
[353:43.10]Dude, you found bacon?
[353:45.24]Epic.
[353:53.25]Dude, bacon strips.
[353:55.59]Epic!
[353:58.09]Stop doing that!
[353:59.09]Okay.
[354:15.57]Let's just do the next case.
[354:18.88]Or anything on the way to the next case.
[354:22.30]Ooh.
[354:24.91]Hmm.
[354:25.85]Ooh!
[354:27.53]Here comes the groom!
[354:31.03]What time am I going to be over there for case 4-1?
[354:33.25]By 1pm.
[354:33.85]Hmm.
[354:43.00]That ain't that far.
[354:43.64]Let's do it.
[355:01.62]That's just one I have to be back there by.
[355:04.90]Not... I'm not burning that much time.
[355:07.01]I just need to be back there by one team.
[355:10.21]Right?
[355:12.31]That's... this is not softlock.
[355:27.22]Yeah, that's when the case becomes available.
[355:28.92]Not... What's going on?
[355:30.26]What the fuck?
[355:31.16]Should've brought the chainsaw thing.
[356:04.63]Oh, he has a chainsaw.
[356:13.14]Don't worry, honey.
[356:14.86]The other ones didn't mean anything to me.
[356:19.18]Just remember to say I do.
[356:20.57]I mean, take away the gore.
[356:23.71]This is just Bowser.
[356:24.77]Well, I'm not waiting anymore.
[356:29.42]I knew I wouldn't die, Virgin.
[356:31.42]I can't wait.
[356:32.64]I can't wait.
[356:33.80]I can't wait.
[356:35.24]Come to the end, Dad.
[356:40.65]Come to the end.
[356:41.93]Marry me.
[356:43.47]Come to the end.
[356:45.87]If anyone knows of any reason why these two should not be joined in union, speak now.
[356:54.39]Here I come.
[356:58.30]No!
[356:59.08]I like that person.
[357:00.85]I hope I one-shot this guy.
[357:21.35]Oh my god, he's running really fast!
[357:27.87]Wait, I got a fucking gun!
[357:36.02]Oh shit, that didn't really work like I thought it was going to.
[357:38.42]Oh fuck, I'm gonna die!
[357:51.42]Oh my god, he's so fast!
[357:55.28]Bacon!
[358:00.25]Where's he going?
[358:06.59]Where is he?
[358:06.87]Where is he?
[358:07.79]Where is he?
[358:08.11]Where is he?
[358:08.51]I don't know where he is!
[358:15.87]I got a Psycho Mask?
[358:16.91]What?
[358:29.00]He runs a hundred miles per hour, and I unloaded the whole bag.
[358:32.98]I unloaded an entire assault rifle into him.
[358:44.75]And he runs a thousand miles per hour.
[358:46.37]Let me try that again.
[358:49.77]It'll be right here, right?
[358:54.75]I wonder if I just try to headshot him.
[359:07.41]Wait till he slows down.
[359:14.34]He catches his breath, and then shoot him.
[359:44.99]Alright, he needs to run out of breath, and then I'm gonna go back.
[359:54.15]Is he out of breath?
[359:55.09]No!
[360:08.15]Can I kill him with, like, a backstab?
[360:13.38]Shoot him in the pig... Shoot him in the pig dick?
[360:17.74]That's too late.
[360:18.20]I don't have enough bullets.
[360:22.28]Out of breath.
[360:33.30]No.
[360:33.62]Yep, there he goes.
[360:38.94]Oh, shit!
[360:39.82]I didn't knock him down.
[360:45.90]That's not a very good picture.
[360:53.01]Oh, no.
[360:58.71]That's a good one.
[361:04.04]Oh, I thought he was slowing down!
[361:09.65]I gotta take out the linksword.
[361:19.31]Oh, shit.
[361:20.98]Oh, shit.
[361:22.54]Oh, shit.
[361:23.00]It's you with me.
[361:41.55]Oops.
[361:43.69]Oops.
[361:50.13]Greedy.
[361:51.21]That was really greedy.
[362:04.36]This thing sucks!
[362:20.05]It's a toy.
[362:22.27]What am I gonna do?
[362:23.07]Punch him?
[362:25.41]I'm gonna hit him with a handbag?
[362:26.43]It's over.
[362:33.90]Where's he going?
[362:41.29]Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[362:43.69]You gotta be kidding me.
[362:44.63]Somebody said combo with it.
[362:45.97]And yo.
[362:48.00]Yo.
[362:49.48]Yo.
[362:51.10]Oh, no.
[362:51.72]Urgent.
[362:52.08]I'm a little busy.
[362:55.89]I can't.
[362:56.29]I'm a little busy.
[362:56.89]There's something going on right now.
[363:15.31]Son of a bitch.
[363:16.93]Why?
[363:18.01]Why do I have the toy?
[363:23.34]Why do I have the toy?
[363:26.00]Is there anything over there I can- wait.
[363:28.31]No, it's too risky.
[363:35.59]I have to drink that shit over there.
[363:42.89]I need to go get the drink.
[363:46.93]Ready?
[363:48.31]Go for it now.
[363:49.41]Slow down.
[363:49.93]Stop.
[363:50.63]Nope.
[363:51.85]Go get it!
[363:53.49]What's over here?
[363:53.97]Cheeseburgers!
[363:55.17]Cheeseburger!
[363:57.40]Oh my goodness!
[364:15.12]Extra hit.
[364:17.40]This is about to break, too.
[364:19.95]This is really bad.
[364:20.83]What am I gonna kill him with?
[364:22.47]The handbag?
[364:24.99]Is there any weapons back there?
[364:26.99]There's a briefcase.
[364:27.63]Give me the briefcase.
[364:30.51]I'm gonna go for the suitcase.
[364:39.15]I'm gonna run out of time for this case.
[364:48.76]Run out of breath!
[364:51.82]You motherfucker!
[365:07.08]Should've just used that from the very beginning.
[365:08.84]Turned into a zombie?
[365:17.60]Our wedding night would have been so... No!
[365:48.59]I pressed the confetti button.
[365:50.67]And then a smiley face.
[365:56.51]Thanks for doing that.
[365:58.11]Okay, we gotta go.
[365:58.55]Come on.
[366:02.33]Gems?
[366:03.77]I never thought I would- I never thought I would see that.
[366:05.96]I know neither.
[366:06.50]I can't- Okay, come to the safe house with me.
[366:10.76]Let's go.
[366:11.60]Let's go.
[366:14.88]Uh, are you injured?
[366:15.54]Eat this.
[366:16.74]Here, eat this.
[366:19.40]Wait, there's a chainsaw!
[366:21.08]I gotta pick you up.
[366:22.88]No, not the chainsaw.
[366:25.72]Do I pick you up?
[366:31.25]Let's go!
[366:51.06]She'll make it, right?
[366:51.76]Oh, I hope she does!
[366:54.80]I hope she does!
[366:56.22]It's not that far.
[367:07.64]It's very far.
[367:08.56]Oh.
[367:09.66]Oh, no.
[367:12.49]It's very far.
[367:14.55]It's extraordinarily far.
[367:23.57]I would've had plenty of time if I didn't try to beat the guy to death with a sword.
[367:32.65]Come on, Danny!
[367:44.35]Go, Danny!
[367:48.50]Danny, you'll make it just right through!
[367:53.02]I was told to run.
[367:54.58]Is this correct?
[367:55.26]I was told just to keep running.
[367:57.50]I hope you're not lying to me.
[368:00.48]I hope so.
[368:02.19]If not, then this is bad.
[368:04.01]She's not gotten out yet.
[368:05.11]She's dead.
[368:18.11]I was specifically told that they'll...
[368:21.33]No, not only was I told, I was screamed at that they will get out and follow you.
[368:33.06]No, that was not one guy.
[368:34.10]That was 5,000 people.
[368:44.88]Oh shit.
[368:47.52]Unbelievable.
[369:10.36]I have to do the fight again.
[369:13.17]Is the checkpoint the fight?
[369:14.75]Because if it is, I'm going to pick up the fucking briefcase.
[369:25.26]Is it after it?
[369:42.81]Because this one is 10-15.
[369:44.17]This is right after that.
[369:48.01]Is it the checkpoint?
[369:49.51]Will it be?
[369:51.87]Let me see.
[369:53.26]If this is fighting boss.
[369:54.34]Okay, alright.
[369:56.88]Let's go!
[369:57.24]Go!
[369:57.44]Go!
[369:59.54]Go!
[369:59.82]Go!
[370:00.12]Go!
[370:00.48]Go!
[370:00.78]Go!
[370:02.54]Get in the chair!
[370:04.16]Get in the chair!
[370:04.68]Danny, get in the chair!
[370:10.25]I need a spoiled hamper.
[370:21.14]Can I put her in the chair?
[370:25.82]Let me get her in the chair.
[370:27.54]Come here.
[370:29.98]Wait, where are you going?
[370:34.46]What?
[370:36.00]What's going on?
[370:37.38]Get in the chair.
[370:38.30]Alright, let's go!
[370:44.64]What?
[370:45.24]No!
[370:45.52]Get in the f- Get in the wheelchair!
[370:55.27]Please!
[370:56.43]Stop the puke!
[370:58.66]Just puke and run, man.
[371:00.26]Even if it goes behind you.
[371:01.36]It don't matter.
[371:01.90]Look at what people are covered in.
[371:07.83]Danny, we're almost there.
[371:09.03]Oh my God.
[371:12.97]How did I run out of time?
[371:14.45]I even, it was slower.
[371:16.66]Okay.
[371:19.54]What?
[371:22.06]Checkpoint.
[371:22.74]Look at this.
[371:23.12]I got it.
[371:23.64]Let's go.
[371:40.54]Get in the chair!
[371:43.98]What are you doing?
[371:51.63]Oh, fuck it.
[371:53.67]Display every machine here.
[371:55.09]Chances increase!
[372:08.77]Here, eat this!
[372:13.60]Here, take this!
[372:16.45]Quick, use it!
[372:37.12]She's laughing.
[372:39.00]She just laughed.
[372:50.18]Okay.
[372:51.80]If she actually gets in the chair and doesn't glitch out and fly across the screen, this will be fine.
[372:58.06]Hey, keep up!
[373:09.44]There's still time
[373:46.84]We're close, we're close, we're close, we're close, we're close, we're close, we're close!
[373:55.99]There it is!

[374:21.45]God damn it.
[374:25.59]It's going to happen.
[374:27.00]It just has to be done right.
[374:31.48]I don't have to restart it.
[374:32.48]I just have to get her to sit in the chair.
[374:33.94]I need to chainsaw.
[374:35.12]Watch.
[374:35.38]Go.
[374:36.68]Chainsaw's already lit.

[374:55.89]I-I-I didn't answer you perfectly.
[374:58.99]Okay, that's fine.
[375:02.86]It's definitely possible, but the zombies just complete fucking surround you if you stand still for five seconds.
[375:18.57]I'm gonna try this one more time.
[375:28.50]That's how the game works.
[375:30.62]Yeah, but like they seem to come out of fucking nowhere.
[375:34.68]There's like four people in front of us and then all of a sudden I turn around and there's 45 people around her.
[375:42.63]Get the fuck over here!
[375:44.85]Get over here!
[375:46.55]Stay with me!
[375:47.35]Look, there's like five people.

[377:35.00]This can't break.
[377:38.02]Avoid zombies.
[377:50.59]Pretty damn good.
[378:01.14]Oops!

[379:00.21]You're not in.
[379:02.90]You're in now.
[379:04.42]Don't let him come in.
[379:05.28]Don't let him go.
[379:05.88]Okay.
[379:08.02]Go.
[379:08.46]Go.
[379:08.72]That was not a whole lot of time lost.
[379:16.38]It's got to be perfect.
[379:24.66]Don't bump into the goddamn... The first one was so good.
[379:26.93]I just bumped into a fucking kiosk.
[379:34.12]This is important.
[379:34.70]This has to play out correctly.
[379:36.71]Here we go.
[379:37.21]Ready?
[379:38.89]Check this out.
[379:39.61]There's nobody around us.
[379:41.85]Stop.
[379:42.29]Open door.
[379:46.29]Get in.
[379:59.62]Go.
[379:59.90]Keep up.
[380:01.18]Good.
[380:01.82]I made you go farther.
[380:02.60]Keep up.
[380:03.63]Come on Danny, let's go!
[380:04.81]You gotta be with me on this one!
[380:08.17]Where's the beginning?
[380:26.12]Faster route than that, you're right!
[380:28.42]How can I be so foolish?
[380:36.93]It's over.
[380:37.27]It's over.
[380:37.51]It's already over.
[380:37.93]It's over.
[380:38.33]It's over.
[380:38.67]It's over.
[380:39.03]It's over.
[380:39.37]It's over.
[380:39.75]There's too many people randomly spawned here.
[380:43.43]Reset it.
[380:43.71]Reset it.
[380:43.99]Reset it.
[380:46.29]How do I just reset?
[380:47.09]How do I just reset?
[380:53.78]I can't believe I drove into a goddamn kiosk.
[380:55.90]I can't fucking believe it.
[380:57.02]I can't believe I drove into a kiosk.
[380:58.98]That was the one.
[381:09.92]It's got to be a good scenario coming through the door.
[381:21.63]Come on.
[381:21.97]Give us a good run here.
[381:24.23]Do the most direct route, but then I break the thing.
[381:26.39]Look at that zombie spawn.
[381:30.31]It's okay.
[381:30.75]Alright, let's go.
[381:36.66]You got grabbed by the... Get it!
[381:38.10]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[381:40.17]You stupid idiot.
[381:41.49]What are you thinking?
[381:42.11]What's wrong with you?
[381:43.43]Why have you done this?
[381:44.57]Why did you do it like that?
[381:50.55]Direct.
[381:51.45]Even if we run over zombies, I can still make it.
[381:54.17]It's gonna break, but we're gonna have to run.
[381:59.54]Shit.
[382:02.22]I can't believe it.
[382:07.12]I can't believe it.
[382:08.24]It's over.
[382:13.17]Chainsaw broke the chair.
[382:14.30]Let's move!
[382:18.86]Quick!
[382:21.34]Follow me!

[382:57.33]That's too much time.
[383:10.52]Don't kill the first two zombies.
[383:11.46]They're the ones that... Good spawn.
[383:13.19]Really, really good spawn.
[383:14.25]I mean, like, spectacular spawn.
[383:41.30]This is the one.

[384:40.09]Fuck.
[384:41.23]Okay, everybody relax.

[391:34.37]Alright, I'm gonna dynamite him.
[391:42.80]Seems like a good play.
[391:44.42]Could do a lot of damage when he slows down again.
[391:47.52]Where's he going?
[391:53.47]I just got destroyed.
[392:00.40]What?!
[392:03.20]Just gotta catch my breath!

[393:39.66]They gotta work.
[393:42.19]They gotta work.
[393:43.07]Come on.
[393:46.07]Why am I not getting a slowdown here?
[393:47.33]Here it comes.
[393:57.21]Ooh.
[394:01.27]Oh my god, I'm getting too cocky!
[394:09.60]Just one hit, that's all I need.
[394:10.58]Just swing at him once.
[394:15.04]He'll do the rest.
[394:17.58]Wow, that freaked me out.
[394:28.43]Had to get something.
[394:43.54]Swing at him!
[394:46.74]What the fuck?
[394:47.70]Why would you dodge?
[394:48.70]I pressed the button in.
[394:49.77]I pressed the button in accidentally.
[394:58.11]Dodge roll.
[394:58.93]Left mouse button.
[395:00.34]Whatever the hell it is.
[395:12.25]Holy shit, that was close.

[396:11.92]Have you tried hitting him?
[396:14.06]Yeah, look at his health.
[396:15.33]I've hit him a hundred damn times.
[396:17.33]I shot him with a full magazine.
[396:19.21]I was hitting him twice.
[396:23.25]It does less damage than holding down a button.
[396:28.92]Who the fuck is that?
[396:31.26]What just happened?
[396:32.65]What?
[396:32.91]Somebody just flew out.
[396:35.21]Why did I throw that?
[396:36.39]I think I was in a bath towel.
[396:48.90]I can't go in.
[396:51.16]I can't go in.
[396:52.16]He's in a bad spot.

[401:12.22]I was trying to have the bucket land and hit it right in the head when I took the photo.
[401:21.15]Soft block.
[401:22.61]I don't think so.
[401:28.80]Anybody here got a softlock?
[401:30.46]I don't think so.
[401:31.65]You got a softlock?
[401:32.81]I don't think so.
[401:34.17]A softlock?
[401:35.05]I don't think so.
[401:45.03]I'm here.
[401:45.37]I'm ready for my next assignment.
[402:03.10]I can't believe this is happening.
[402:05.58]Hey, I don't know what TK's up to, but he's the one behind this.
[402:08.77]I'll see you tomorrow.
[402:09.81]TK?
[402:11.25]Are you sure?
[402:12.41]He paid that poor sap to do it for him.
[402:15.47]But that's not possible.
[402:17.89]Why would he let his own zombie supply loose?
[402:20.41]Sabotage his own show?
[402:21.93]End of the stream, boys?
[402:22.89]Yeah, we're gonna pick it back up tomorrow.
[402:25.37]Wait a minute.
[402:26.99]Is he the one who fed you that tape?
[402:29.70]It's been like almost seven hours, guys.
[402:31.40]It's been a long time.
[402:32.50]It's been seven hours!
[402:33.66]Man, not again.
[402:35.22]It sounded like it came from outside.
[402:37.60]Plus, I want enough to have a whole stream tomorrow.
[402:42.54]I can't tell who it is, though.
[402:44.26]Then I'd better get out there and find out for myself.
[402:48.95]Now who's ditching him?
[402:51.67]I don't know if she's really brave or just really stupid.
[402:58.92]How many cases are left?
[402:59.66]We got 7, 8... Yeah, this is perfect.
[403:03.26]Perfect time to end this right here.
[403:04.76]Because then I got... 5, 6, 7... Yeah, we got like... We're good.
[403:13.25]We're like at almost exactly the halfway point.
[403:30.44]Yeah, look at how much time I got.
[403:31.84]Because I ain't just... I'm not just gonna do case 4-2.
[403:34.17]No, no, no, no, no.
[403:37.83]Look at all this other stuff I can do.
[403:39.71]No, no, no, no, no.
[403:40.63]We're gonna do this tomorrow.
[403:47.54]Save the game, and... I'm not just gonna go right to 4-2.
[403:50.48]Why would I do that?
[403:56.90]He's gonna ditch us tomorrow.
[403:58.61]What?
[404:00.85]Why would I... I'm streaming tomorrow.
[404:03.05]What are you... I don't think so.
[404:14.58]Yeah, we'll finish this tomorrow.
[404:20.84]I'm gonna do it.
[404:22.72]But first... Hold on.
[404:25.48]I gotta save some photos here.
[404:27.66]That one didn't work out as well as I thought it was gonna do.
[404:31.86]I mean, whatever.
[404:35.10]This is fucked up.
[404:37.40]Why is there a share button?
[404:43.80]These still exist.
[404:55.66]How do those still exist?
[405:04.65]Oh, it's because it happened again.
[405:05.87]Right, okay.
[405:10.22]Case five.
[405:11.48]Alright.
[405:13.28]So, a game is saved.
[405:14.24]Everything's good to go.
[405:16.68]And we'll do the bits.
[405:18.89]We'll probably end at the seven, seven and a half hour mark.
[405:22.85]And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[405:24.41]I'll start earlier tomorrow.
[405:25.29]The reason why I started like 20 minutes late today is because I had a ton of troubleshooting problems trying to get this Xbox controller emulation to work.
[405:34.86]Because this game cannot natively take any controllers.
[405:38.96]Unless it's like from 2003.
[405:40.24]But.
[405:40.62]I'll see you tomorrow.
[405:44.62]We'll finish it tomorrow.
[405:46.82]And let's do the bits and everything.
[405:50.28]Hang out for a little bit.
[405:52.42]See you tomorrow.
[406:05.27]See you guys later.
[406:15.38]I have to check it every time.
[406:17.48]Let me, hold on.
[406:24.31]Let me check it one more time.
[406:27.73]No, not that, not that, not that.
[406:36.90]Okay.
[406:39.52]Can this work?
[406:43.08]This is just not... It's so broken.
[406:49.40]It doesn't matter what I do.
[406:53.56]But... I have to get on top of that.
[406:57.18]The next day off I have, I'm going to spend like a month fixing that to see if I can get it to work.
[407:06.03]Because it's been too long.
[407:08.52]Anywho.
[407:09.90]Thanks for joining us.
[407:11.82]See you tomorrow.
[407:13.68]But, those of you that are sticking around for a little bit.
[407:16.97]Very cool.
[407:19.13]I'm going to go back.
[407:21.00]Kazzy gave five subs, touched on it, but thank you for the five community subs.
[407:24.84]Homeless Sperm, thanks for the 300 bits.
[407:28.23]Hi, Jerma.
[407:28.63]Dead Rising 1 and 2, off the record, are all on the PS4, if you didn't know.
[407:32.77]Also, there's a game called W.A.T.T.A.M.
[407:36.65]from the creator of Katamari Damacy.
[407:38.34]It'll be out on the 17th of December.
[407:41.20]Really?
[407:45.40]That's interesting.
[407:47.88]Wasn't, like, Fat Princess...
[407:51.16]Dead Rising 1 and 2 off the record on the PS4.
[407:53.08]Well, this is on PC.
[407:54.38]You would figure... I don't know.
[407:56.38]I thought that this was like a PC game that they brought over with like 1920x1080.
[408:01.50]Does it run at 1080 on PS4?
[408:04.03]Or is it like 720?
[408:06.81]I don't know.
[408:16.23]Yeah, I mean, like, fuck me for thinking a video game is going to work when I buy it and open it.
[408:26.38]Right?
[408:26.64]I mean, what the hell?
[408:27.98]How dare you think that?
[408:31.37]Says the game developers and publishers that continue to sell it Anywho I want to play the Katamari that's on the 360 Because I have a 360 now and I want to do Katamari again
[409:01.01]We'll see.
[409:04.25]Vodone, thanks for the 300 bits.
[409:05.77]Is this an out-of-season April Fool's joke?
[409:10.71]Wait, what?
[409:11.27]Playing Dead Rising 2?
[409:12.65]Why would that be a joke?
[409:20.55]I don't know.
[409:20.97]I don't know.
[409:21.39]I don't know.
[409:21.79]I don't know.
[409:22.19]I don't know.
[409:24.37]Hey, Bink Video, thanks for the 1,000 bits.
[409:26.27]Where are the poo-poo icons?
[409:30.54]I don't know.
[409:31.46]Not here.
[409:34.22]DarkSoul, thanks for the 250.
[409:35.60]Really great stream.
[409:36.82]Glad I caught it.
[409:38.14]You're in a coma.
[409:38.78]Please wake up.
[409:39.38]You wake up.
[409:39.82]You're in the... You've been in a coma.
[409:41.32]You've been in a coma for five years.
[409:42.95]You were being the Karate Kid and you've been unconscious since.
[409:45.11]Please come back, Jeremy.
[409:45.83]Really looking forward to green screen too.
[409:49.69]Generally love the variety you have with the content.
[409:53.23]It's a lot of fun.
[409:56.08]Jeremy, wake up.
[409:56.60]You're in a coma.
[409:58.58]Imagine, like, that's, like, the funny meme thing.
[410:01.20]But imagine if you just, like, your eyes just opened one day, like, after 20, 30 years of being alive.
[410:06.53]And you were just in a hospital bed and you were, like, 12.
[410:08.41]That's scary.
[410:18.23]Kali, Brady, thanks for the five subs.
[410:26.43]I'm not sure I saw this one.
[410:30.44]But thank you, Dark Soul.
[410:33.23]Green screen DLC for free should be really fun.
[410:37.37]That channel will be open soon.
[410:38.76]Probably after tomorrow's stream.
[410:41.76]The day after that I'll make it and make all the rules and everything.
[410:45.04]It'll be almost the same exact thing as last time.
[410:50.61]Abomination Zero, thanks for the 250 bits.
[410:53.03]Jerma, I'm sick of arguing about this.
[410:54.73]The cookie sitting in the milk is objectively bad.
[410:57.73]It doesn't mix like cereal, it just sits in the bottom and gets gross.
[411:01.05]If you drink all of the milk, it's still there.
[411:03.62]It's a... Of course it's gross.
[411:12.66]Um... Yes, it's gross.
[411:16.12]Do you know what else is gross?
[411:18.97]McDonald's.
[411:20.49]I still eat that.
[411:22.57]And I go, oh, that was pretty good.
[411:25.03]The greasy pizza from 7-Eleven is disgusting.
[411:30.39]But I've eaten it, and I'm like, alright, whatever.
[411:38.82]This is not a bad argument.
[411:40.26]Weird, gross things, they still taste good, they're still edible.
[411:45.96]If it's there, I'm gonna eat it.
[411:49.09]Your burgers aren't on the bottom of a glass of milk.
[411:52.58]Oh, are you sure about that?
[411:55.92]Are you sure about the preparations of your pristine Big Mac that you ordered?
[412:08.80]Who has any idea?
[412:14.79]It's all the same in the stomach.
[412:15.83]Somebody gets it.
[412:17.19]Sad Vega, you get it.
[412:21.98]Eating is kind of a pain in the ass.
[412:25.43]Don't you guys ever think that?
[412:27.97]Sometimes I'll be like in the middle of something and it's just... I just want to continue to do that thing and you gotta take an hour plus sometimes to prepare and eat food.
[412:39.90]Even if you get fast food, it's like a significant portion of every single day.
[412:45.58]We probably spend like three to four hours plus eating every day.
[412:55.25]It's like, that's too much.
[413:01.05]No, time it next time.
[413:02.09]The next, even, okay, if you go, no, no, seriously, it takes about, it takes at least two to three hours to eat every meal.
[413:10.37]It's not, yeah, it depends.
[413:11.29]Sometimes if you, okay, if you like buy, if you buy food from the grocery store and you make it, that even, it takes like 40 to 50 minutes sometimes to make food.
[413:21.75]What, if, do you, do you, do you guys make food?
[413:28.16]Half an hour?
[413:28.74]This ain't Rachael Ray.
[413:30.27]Some of that shit works.
[413:34.57]That's cooking, not eating.
[413:36.66]Yeah, but the act of eating requires the cooking.
[413:41.16]So that's... time that's added.
[413:50.54]Guys, even Kraft macaroni and cheese, the orange box shit, takes like 25 minutes to make.
[413:57.45]To make it right.
[413:58.05]What do you mean it does not?
[414:06.69]How long does it take to boil water?
[414:10.08]I think you guys don't understand time management skills.
[414:13.48]I play Dead Rising, I know these things.
[414:20.72]It takes like five to ten minutes to even boil a pot of water.
[414:29.12]You boil the water, you put the macaroni in there.
[414:32.07]Let's see, Kraft, Mac, and Cheese directions.
[414:41.96]You boil, you make, it doesn't take you three minutes to make Kraft, Mac, and Cheese.
[414:46.86]Ahem, ahem, ahem.
[414:48.29]bring six cups of water to a boil cook the macaroni for seven to eight minutes drain the water from the macaroni that's another 20 30 40 seconds depending on how hot it is place macaroni margarine milk and cheese sauce into the saucepan Ster it up takes about two or three minutes to Ster that up and get it ready and then guess what you eat it out of that pot
[415:15.56]So the second that it comes off the stove, you go, Ow!
[415:19.36]Ow, ow, my mouth!
[415:21.78]What?
[415:23.53]You let it sit there for like a few minutes so it cools down.
[415:25.75]It takes like fucking 20 fucking... It takes like fucking 20 fucking minutes, mate.
[415:35.83]And then you have to sit there after eating like a whole carton of crap mac and cheese and you have to do like the... Ugh...
[415:46.82]Oh, you said you did that for about 15 minutes before you can even go back to work?
[415:53.14]That's a 30-minute ordeal.
[415:54.84]Yeah, that's just mac and cheese.
[416:01.49]20 minutes equals 3 hours.
[416:03.25]That's how long it takes to make macaroni and cheese out of the box.
[416:08.77]Is that what you eat every day?
[416:10.21]Three meals a day?
[416:13.65]That's a side!
[416:14.99]You- you make us, you know, just eat mac and cheese!
[416:25.74]I hope you don't do that!
[416:26.96]I went to college, so did I!
[416:32.32]I know that life!
[416:36.52]Just eat it raw.
[416:39.25]And don't even get me started if you're making some kind of casserole or something.
[416:42.11]If you're baking like a turkey in the oven or like a ham, see you in an hour.
[416:48.34]You guys ever slow cooked before?
[416:50.74]That shit takes like six to eight hours in a slow cooker.
[416:53.94]Am I being really told that it doesn't take more than a couple hours to make food for a day?
[417:04.44]An hour for a turkey, that takes like three hours.
[417:07.34]Who bakes a turkey every week?
[417:11.55]Oh, okay.
[417:12.65]That gets me thinking.
[417:13.51]That gets me to think about this.
[417:14.63]Turn the music off.
[417:15.25]This is actually fucking funny.
[417:16.71]So today, so today, I was, I was pulling out of my, I was pulling out of my spot, right?
[417:25.53]And I'm like pulling out into the road and I noticed, oh, there's, there's like, in like the neighborhood, there's like, there's like people outside.
[417:32.61]There's like kids playing.
[417:34.13]oh cool okay and like they were playing uh like wiffle ball or something these probably six years old or something right so I'm out there and I see okay everyone like watch out here comes the car everyone gets out of the way and I'm like okay everyone's safe and they're the parents were out there and it was just like a very quick like oh hello like neighbor kind of thing I was like hey how are you and I go playing and they go yep we're playing and I go hey who's winning
[418:02.01]And they go, everyone, because it was like 10 kids.
[418:07.37]I was like, oh, hey, who's winning?
[418:09.77]And I was thinking to myself, like, oh, I look like a fucking asshole.
[418:12.33]Like I'm saying, like, who's winning the game?
[418:13.86]That's what I care about.
[418:17.78]And then I just get, they were like, no, everyone's winning.
[418:19.70]Ha ha.
[418:19.96]And I'm like, yeah, yeah, that's great.
[418:22.64]That's exactly what it should be.
[418:24.66]And then I kind of was like, okay, bye.
[418:26.04]And I'm sitting in the driveway going like, I look like a fucking dick that only cares about winning.
[418:31.57]To like six-year-olds.
[418:33.35]That's not what I meant, though.
[418:34.25]But that's how I looked.
[418:41.17]No, I didn't slam the accelerate.
[418:44.96]That's a normal thing to say?
[418:46.26]I don't know.
[418:49.00]I was like really thinking about that.
[418:50.56]That does not sound like normal when I think about it like a million times in a row.
[418:57.60]Who's winning?
[419:00.99]Six-year-olds.
[419:03.26]Is it normal?
[419:11.10]How does this relate to turkeys?
[419:12.40]Because somebody said you're eating a turkey every week.
[419:15.09]Like, what are you, some kind of, like, rich asshole?
[419:18.61]Hey, who's winning?
[419:20.65]Turkey done yet?
[419:24.41]Like, I bake a turkey three times a week?
[419:29.57]Like, no, I don't.
[419:31.31]I don't do any of these things.
[419:38.71]That's kind of a stretch.
[419:40.19]Well, I really wanted to tell that story seven hours ago.
[419:51.98]What about the kids' answer?
[419:53.02]Everyone.
[419:54.72]Yeah, that's fine.
[419:55.50]You don't want a little kid to be losing.
[419:59.47]What did you want them to do?
[420:00.87]Be like, oh, yeah, well, Jeffrey and Caroline, they're winning.
[420:06.61]Stacey's losing right now.
[420:09.26]I'm losing?
[420:10.16]Yep.
[420:11.32]Oh, I thought I was playing.
[420:18.90]That would be bad.
[420:19.68]Alright.
[420:21.23]Moral of the story is it takes more than 20 minutes to eat three and cook and prepare and eat three to four meals a day.
[420:30.37]And I know some of you guys eating once a day and you're like, what are you talking about?
[420:32.97]It takes me 10 minutes.
[420:33.85]I eat one giant piece of meat.
[420:36.58]Don't do that anymore.
[420:38.00]Spread it out.
[420:40.59]should be eating like three four plus meals a day snacks sometimes in the middle smaller portions you could eat the same thing but just spread it out put it in the fridge it's really hard I know it's real hard
[421:04.57]Because I know exactly what you mean by that.
[421:07.35]Because when you buy the steak and cheese sub, you get the large.
[421:11.73]And it's in front of you.
[421:12.93]And you're hungry.
[421:13.61]And you get through half of the large.
[421:15.01]And you're just like, I have to eat the rest of this.
[421:19.27]I have to.
[421:21.82]I know that I shouldn't.
[421:23.16]I just put it away and eat it later and have something else.
[421:27.60]No, you house the whole thing.
[421:30.20]It's like 1,800 calories of food.
[421:35.00]And then you're slow for the next four hours.
[421:38.14]And then you don't even, you're not even hungry for dinner.
[421:40.32]Because you acted like a goddamn camel.
[421:43.93]And you eat like, you ate that one large steak and cheese for breakfast.
[421:47.99]And now you're not even hungry at dinner.
[421:55.37]Over encumbered.
[421:56.31]Yeah, I still do this.
[422:00.75]And it's bad.
[422:01.27]You shouldn't be doing it.
[422:06.87]The most recent science does not support that conclusion, and it hasn't for more than a decade.
[422:10.36]Intermittent fasting is the healthiest thing you can do.
[422:12.70]One meal a day is actually the best for you.
[422:14.34]Please Google... Uh... Hold on a second here.
[422:25.31]One meal a day, a huge meal, is... That's how you, like, that's how you gain a bunch of weight.
[422:35.48]You're not eating, like, 2,000 calories and then going to bed, right?
[422:50.25]Yes.
[422:51.05]As long as it's under 2,000 calories.
[422:54.37]What?
[422:56.39]One meal a day.
[422:58.38]Let me look this up.
[423:00.61]The one meal a day diet is a weight loss plan that requires a person to only eat one meal per day.
[423:09.26]Is it safe to eat one meal a day?
[423:18.14]This is called, okay, this is called the OMAD diet.
[423:21.19]This is called the UMAD diet.
[423:25.29]What the fuck is this?
[423:30.27]Fasting from food for 23 hours a day and eating whatever you want for one meal this sounds like a scam You can just eat whatever you want as long as you eat once That meal can range from a double cheeseburger and fries to a what the fuck is this is this real?
[423:49.92]the you mad diet
[423:58.64]I tried the extreme fasting OMAD diet.
[424:02.08]Here's what happened to me.
[424:03.08]Let's see what happened.
[424:10.30]You could eat pizza and burgers every day, drink beer, and still lose weight.
[424:16.50]This is like... I've seen this commercial.
[424:24.27]As long as you eat less than 2,000 calories a day, you can eat whatever you want.
[424:29.94]one but I would don't if you ate 1999 calories in one sitting I feel like I would want to puke I feel like I would be so full and I would hurt
[424:54.86]What does the science say?
[424:56.92]Like a lot of health trends, just because people do it doesn't mean it's good for you.
[425:00.09]The research is mixed when it comes to whether or not it's safe to eat one meal a day.
[425:05.03]One 2007 study connects eating once a day to an increase in blood pressure and cholesterol.
[425:11.11]Yeah, because people were told, you can eat anything you want, Frank!
[425:14.95]Oh, really?
[425:15.71]And they eat fucking four McDoubles.
[425:29.57]Fasting can improve the body's resistance to diseases.
[425:34.62]Yeah, I know like fasting, but I would never be able to do that.
[425:45.54]I did it for a year in college.
[425:47.06]It's just calorie counting for idiots.
[425:49.38]People who actually binge on these diets typically can't maintain low calories and eat shitty food.
[425:57.06]If you don't binge and aren't exercising, it's fine.
[426:01.61]Just take a multivitamin.
[426:06.76]I guess that makes sense, because if you eat this one meal a day, you just have to be like, okay, uh, just eat once, and I hope I didn't eat a whole fucking pantry worth of food.
[426:17.27]An entire 100 pack of pizza rolls, yeah.
[426:30.94]I would get too hungry.
[426:33.52]I don't know, it'd fuck me up, I feel like.
[426:36.89]I already have, like, enough problems with, like, foods and shit.
[426:39.72]Like, all of the intestinal bullshit.
[426:41.74]If I did this, I would probably, like, I would go into a coma.
[426:48.94]You'd be doing, it would be like the wake up Jeremy in real life.
[426:53.65]What happened?
[426:54.35]Well, he was eating once a day.
[426:56.63]And he was trying, he was so desperately trying to get a pizza roll sponsorship, so that's all he ate.
[427:02.64]He saw Super Size Me, and then thought he could do that with pizza rolls, and then maybe get, like, somebody would pay him.
[427:11.20]He actually, he actually may have been dead for the last, like, four days.
[427:14.79]I don't know.
[427:21.02]Intermittent fasting would probably be good for me.
[427:22.65]Yeah, but here's the thing about fasting for me.
[427:26.65]When I had my colonoscopy, you can't eat solid food for three straight days.
[427:32.65]That was un-fucking-bearable.
[427:38.36]That was the worst thing ever.
[427:42.08]Even by day one or day two, no, I wouldn't be able to handle it.
[427:53.20]I don't think I'd be able to do it.
[427:54.30]And yeah, you'd get used to it.
[427:55.66]I don't think I would.
[427:57.42]My brain is so misfires in every direction.
[428:01.34]Somebody would open a jar of pickles at day one, day two, and I'd just be like, give me those pickles.
[428:06.97]And I'd just start eating them.
[428:07.83]And I'd be like, I don't care.
[428:08.71]It's over.
[428:09.95]But anyways, that's really interesting.
[428:17.49]I don't think I could ever do that.
[428:22.10]But let's keep going.
[428:24.18]Let's do this thing.
[428:27.50]In fact, let's switch it on over.
[428:34.86]Oh, shit.
[428:37.66]Do it again.
[428:38.06]Hey, look at that.
[428:44.60]Thanks for all the subs, guys.
[428:45.46]Appreciate it.
[428:46.78]We'll see you tomorrow.
[428:48.82]Only a few more bits to do.
[428:50.58]Let's do them.
[428:56.19]We got on that because somebody talked about the cookie in the milk thing.
[428:59.19]Right, okay.
[429:00.04]SadVegan, thanks for the 500 bits.
[429:01.98]I'm at a loss for words.
[429:02.92]I seriously expect you to be faster and better.
[429:05.30]That you are killing more people this time around when they have a smarter AI.
[429:08.70]You're amazing.
[429:09.24]I truly mean that in a good way.
[429:11.38]They die quicker in this game.
[429:14.83]And you have to go further distances in this game.
[429:18.75]They die five times faster.
[429:20.19]I don't think the AI is smarter.
[429:35.75]Yeah, they lose HP much faster.
[429:38.73]In the first one, somebody could get grabbed and just sit there for a full probably 30 seconds.
[429:46.44]They die quicker here than in Dead Rising 2.
[429:48.14]I don't know why, but off the record is weird.
[429:49.94]Is that real?
[429:58.61]You need to clear paths and strategize.
[430:00.31]Alright, well, you need to, like, get in a fight with the other people that are in this chat that tell me that that's the worst idea.
[430:08.61]Jess, you guys should have seen this pre-stream chat.
[430:11.70]It was, like, people fighting.
[430:18.00]I've never seen such division.
[430:25.62]Fight, fight, fight, fight.
[430:31.67]Constant conflict.
[430:35.70]I still think it's a lot of fun.
[430:36.94]I think it's great.
[430:46.59]If I wasn't having fun, I wouldn't play it.
[430:48.55]That simple.
[430:49.79]I love it.
[430:57.26]Jerma also has a pro tip.
[430:58.74]Knife and mop got me through a lot of this game early on.
[431:01.28]It's a deadly weapon mop.
[431:03.58]Have I even seen a mop?
[431:05.85]It's a spear.
[431:07.79]It's the most combat superior weapon known to man throughout history.
[431:11.23]Now that I agree with.
[431:13.87]Yeah.
[431:14.87]We've talked about the spear before.
[431:16.79]It's just a long stick that has a knife at the end.
[431:20.82]You can kill somebody before they even come near you.
[431:25.78]How was the spear ever fair?
[431:28.72]If you knew that you were going up against spears, wouldn't you also bring spears?
[431:36.71]Why would you bring, like, a sword to a spear fight?
[431:39.33]Spears were the guns of, like, the 1200s.
[431:42.71]Hey, Nirshu, thanks for the five community subs.
[431:55.52]Don't think I saw it before.
[431:58.00]Freudian weapon, thanks for the four.
[431:59.20]$1.94.
[431:59.22]Thanks a lot, Freudian.
[432:04.15]Gnarly, thanks for the $2.50.
[432:05.27]How many bits will it take to do a full beatbox?
[432:15.70]$2.50 fucking bits.
[432:16.66]That's what it takes.
[432:18.14]A real one.
[432:18.74]And you might not even be here.
[432:24.31]It's all I can do.
[432:25.61]It's the only talent I have.
[432:27.65]I got on stage one time at a talent show.
[432:31.02]Back in high school.
[432:32.38]And I did that.
[432:33.96]And I remember, like, people were cheering.
[432:37.34]And then one person in the back just screamed and it ruined me.
[432:40.52]They said, Change the beat!
[432:44.43]You do the same beat every time!
[432:47.79]And then I went, I'll see you later, folks!
[432:51.31]And I walked off stage.
[433:06.58]Because I go hard.
[433:07.35]I'm on hard mode.
[433:09.19]Yeah, I...
[433:28.93]Sometimes you have to do, like, the hard one and really test to see if you can get to the true end.
[433:34.27]I got to the true end in... I was gonna say Demon's Souls.
[433:39.27]I need to go to bed.
[433:44.06]The differences between Dead Rising 2 and Off the Record.
[433:46.74]It's a more difficult game with a tougher Frank West and a tougher Fortune City with more aggressive zombies than featured in the same city in Dead Rising 2.
[433:54.62]It actually is a hard one.
[433:59.38]Oh.
[434:00.48]Maybe that's why it's hard.
[434:02.95]Whatever that means.
[434:05.01]I didn't say that.
[434:05.47]Well, I didn't say that.
[434:06.23]You did.
[434:20.69]Also, Death Stranding is great.
[434:21.75]It's been sucking my life away and I'm currently transporting stuff.
[434:25.57]I don't want to read any spoilers.
[434:27.55]Thank you.
[434:28.73]Glad you're having fun.
[434:29.33]I heard it's great.
[434:31.25]Plank, thanks for the 500 bits.
[434:33.29]Jeremiah, I eat all the raw ingredients and make the meal in my stomach.
[434:39.67]You know, this is a diet for everything.
[434:40.66]It's like a raw diet.
[434:44.06]There's a raw diet.
[434:44.78]There's a I eat only fish.
[434:46.18]I eat only fucking spaghetti.
[434:48.98]I have raisins.
[434:50.14]I only eat raisins and cucumbers.
[434:51.90]And I turned into Superman.
[435:02.56]There's a diet.
[435:03.34]There's a million different diets.
[435:05.96]But I'm glad you can do that.
[435:09.26]Thank you Childish Gambino for the $5.
[435:10.78]500 bits.
[435:11.20]Thank you.
[435:13.74]Reaper, thanks for the 250, Jerma.
[435:16.14]I did the YouMad diet for a while, and I did lose about 60 pounds, but I also worked out, and the one meal I did eat was somewhat healthy, like baked chicken, so it does work to an extent.
[435:28.01]That's... glad you found something that works.
[435:34.47]That sounds... that's a lot of weight.
[435:37.85]That's a lot of weight to lose.
[435:39.99]Good for you.
[435:45.37]Thanks for the 250.
[435:49.16]And then finally, StixRenegade, thanks for the 250.
[435:51.22]Bits for a beatbox.
[435:52.16]How much do you draw?
[435:53.44]How much to draw my fursona?
[435:55.68]I will not draw any fursonas.
[435:57.92]I'm not going to draw anything.
[435:59.46]I will only draw urinals.
[436:00.92]That's the only thing I draw on this stream.
[436:05.32]That's it.
[436:09.67]Alright.
[436:10.59]So, I will see you guys tomorrow.
[436:16.73]What?
[436:17.67]Before we go.
[436:18.15]Before we go.
[436:30.05]I want you guys to go say hello to Blordow.
[436:34.76]If you don't know who Blordow is, the person that made all the stuff you're looking at right now, all the music you're listening to.
[436:42.48]They did it all.
[436:47.98]Every piece of art that you see on this channel was done by Blordow.
[436:52.93]And I believe that his brother is currently very sick.
[436:57.21]And I think he's raising money.
[437:06.53]Go give him a shout.
[437:10.72]And if you have anything to contribute, by all means.
[437:15.48]He's been a very, very, very close...
[437:20.73]friend and colleague.
[437:22.55]I've known him for almost 15 plus years.
[437:27.75]We're gonna raid Blordow right now.
[437:32.86]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[437:34.98]Much love to you.
[437:36.68]Take care of yourselves.
[437:38.28]See you soon.
[437:42.08]Cue it up.
[437:43.96]Can I not do it from here?
[437:47.60]There we go.
[437:50.36]See you guys soon.
[437:51.30]See you tomorrow.
[437:52.86]Take care.
[437:55.90]Good night.
