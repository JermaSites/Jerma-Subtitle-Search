[00:29.94]Whatever.
[00:31.62]Whatever.
[00:34.28]What's up?
[00:36.50]How you doing?
[00:41.44]What's with all this whatever stuff?
[00:43.44]Whatever.
[00:43.76]What's happening?
[00:49.84]We got a lot going on today.
[00:51.16]Hope you're doing good.
[00:53.04]Hope you're doing well.
[00:56.24]We've got a three game
[00:59.41]stream today maybe make sure to put maybe at the end of that curse the eye of isis gonna play for a couple hours maybe two three hours then we've got the drug game that's schedule one game with four horsemen and then if there's time maybe a little bit of late night Chrono Trigger never know
[01:31.12]Yeah, let's let the ads play out if they're going to cut me off.
[01:33.52]Let's hope they do.
[01:37.73]Which they'll be running for at least the first few hours of the stream.
[01:41.73]They might run during the co-op stuff too.
[01:44.43]I'll probably just go BRB.
[01:45.91]I think the way that this game works, at least Schedule 1, I think you can kind of just dip.
[01:50.84]We'll see.
[01:58.69]First time watching live.
[01:59.75]How you been?
[02:00.29]That actually is true.
[02:01.01]That's the first time you've ever chatted.
[02:03.63]What's up?
[02:06.73]Hey, don't know when you're going to do the Monster Rancher 2 tournament with the other people, but there's a Monster Rancher YouTuber who... Hold on.
[02:11.55]That went by too fast.
[02:15.63]Yeah, we're trying to get that scheduled.
[02:17.67]I think that's probably going to be
[02:21.16]We're thinking about the 19th on Saturday, but there was a little schedule conflict with one or two people.
[02:25.66]So maybe Thursday, 17th.
[02:29.77]And I'm just doing it with some friends.
[02:31.39]I'm not, it's not going to be a big deal.
[02:33.37]This is not going to be like a huge event or anything.
[02:34.99]So, but I just got cut off.
[02:36.71]I'll be back.
[02:37.35]We'll talk about it in a few minutes.
[02:41.33]I'll be back.
[02:45.47]See you in a few minutes.
[05:19.37]Coming back in a second.
[05:23.58]12 seconds to be exact.
[05:28.30]And we can move to the game.
[05:34.20]Alright.
[05:36.93]Let's do it.
[05:44.11]So what do we leave off?
[05:49.23]I fought a couple of bears.
[05:50.31]That's what I remember.
[05:51.59]Fought a bear.
[05:52.55]Fought two bears.
[05:54.37]Fucked them up.
[05:56.89]Please don't get drunk today.
[05:59.50]Shut up.
[06:06.80]Oh, that's right.
[06:07.20]Okay, so we switched over to... I don't remember any of their names.
[06:13.24]I know that's Abdul.
[06:14.96]I don't... I don't know what the other two names are.
[06:18.46]Darian?
[06:21.90]What is her name?
[06:25.63]Victoria.
[06:26.59]Oh, that's right.
[06:27.13]No, is it?
[06:27.57]Are you sure?
[06:33.13]It's Darian and Ms.
[06:34.43]Sutton.
[06:35.03]Okay.
[06:39.89]Alright, so the last thing I did, I gave...
[06:43.11]Right, OK, I gave Darien the drink to get him to go get up.
[06:49.01]He said, oh, I can't, I can't.
[06:50.35]I need a few moments.
[06:53.11]So I'm still doing what was the last thing I have to do now?
[07:02.28]Because I took all of his weapons, I took all the guns, I took all the ammo, I took everything.
[07:07.48]I got 238 bolts.
[07:08.00]Anybody remember what the last thing we just did?
[07:17.67]We got the safe.
[07:20.45]Yeah, what's the goal right now?
[07:25.14]Yeah, he attacked me.
[07:26.36]He was like... He thought I was a monster and he lunged at me.
[07:30.76]Did I get a key?
[07:31.58]Let's see, what did I get a key to?
[07:32.60]I don't have a key.
[07:35.58]What the hell?
[07:36.16]Oh, I gotta go to the medical area.
[07:38.42]Right.
[07:40.86]Right?
[07:50.00]Do you remember what the fuck?
[07:50.60]Hey, you don't remember either!
[07:51.48]Nobody here seems to remember what we did two or three days ago.
[07:54.78]Something's with the clock.
[08:05.89]Was it yesterday?
[08:06.47]Bro, this was three days ago.
[08:13.58]You know how many episodes of Squidbillies I've watched in between this and that?
[08:16.86]I don't know.
[08:17.34]I don't remember anything about what we just did.
[08:20.06]Go to the big marble staircase?
[08:26.28]Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.
[08:33.11]Big marble staircase.
[08:34.29]Okay.
[08:36.43]But did I get a key?
[08:37.43]I feel like it was like, hey, you need to go here.
[08:40.71]I wish there was like a, what did you just do?
[08:42.61]I guess I could open up the vault and see where the last like cutscene was.
[08:56.76]There's a door down on the first floor of the library you can go out.
[09:00.16]Hell yeah.
[09:03.52]There you are, Josh.
[09:04.28]Just fucking... Just fucking doing business.
[09:07.46]You know what I mean?
[09:08.06]Alright, so there's a door I can go out.
[09:17.67]But once I get on the right track, we'll be good.
[09:18.83]Yeah, I'm going to play this for like probably two or three hours.
[09:21.49]And then we'll do schedule one.
[09:23.37]And then maybe Chrono Trigger.
[09:24.45]Alright, so this is a library.
[09:25.23]We can go to the door apparently here now.
[09:29.17]This one?
[09:30.89]This is the torture exhibition, which we already did that.
[09:39.05]Last review started a world called JermaCraft.
[09:42.00]Oh, that's right.
[09:42.48]Yeah.
[09:47.98]Yeah, but there was so much TNT that ended up getting planted.
[09:50.90]I fucked it up.
[09:57.48]Marble staircase though.
[09:58.40]Hold on.
[09:59.89]Let me look at the map.
[10:03.57]It was that double door?
[10:04.37]Really?
[10:04.57]The torture one?
[10:05.07]Hmm.
[10:07.21]Okay.
[10:11.42]Not this one.
[10:14.96]This one right here?
[10:20.27]Wait.
[10:20.63]He might have a key on him that I didn't take.
[10:39.94]So funny, this thing about old games is, especially old games that didn't have, like, a keeping track of what you did.
[10:45.81]If you came back to a game like this, I mean, it's been three or four days.
[10:48.75]I really just kind of don't remember.
[10:50.15]We were talking about, like, all kinds of fucked up shit, like what your favorite ice cream is.
[10:54.17]But if you came back to a game like this after a few weeks, and you didn't have a guide, good luck.
[10:59.49]There's nothing that's going to tell you where to go.
[11:03.73]This way?
[11:12.52]Music is starting up.
[11:22.92]I guess I wish I remembered what was the last sentence that Abdul said to me.
[11:29.35]This door here?
[11:31.47]No.
[11:42.95]I love someone who just said, I don't know.
[11:44.71]You need to watch the stream as a recap.
[11:52.27]Looking for big stairs.
[11:55.44]These look like big stairs.
[11:59.90]Let me look them up.
[12:02.80]Okay, going upstairs.
[12:09.75]Relax.
[12:16.65]I got a gun.
[12:25.56]This person has a crossbow.
[12:31.10]What?
[12:35.95]Crossbow versus shotgun.
[12:37.13]Who wins?
[12:47.87]I don't know.
[12:48.99]Shotgun is not very far range.
[12:53.05]Took you forever to open that door.
[12:56.08]But if you shoot a crossbow, you need to reload it.
[12:57.58]It takes a long time.
[13:01.88]Where we going here?
[13:02.38]This is... This... Wait.
[13:14.83]How do you sneak by that?
[13:18.40]That guy's a fucking idiot.
[13:19.73]Oh, who would win?
[13:40.12]We may as well have just... I don't know.
[13:42.00]That was just... Whatever.
[13:44.26]Hold on.
[13:44.48]There's a sneaky door here.
[13:49.32]Riveting combat.
[13:50.98]Uh-oh.
[13:54.00]You're gonna leave another... There's gonna be a note.
[13:59.33]Gonna say, next time, I won't miss with my eighth shot telling you I won't miss the next time I shoot it.
[14:07.59]Let me guess.
[14:15.38]Yeah, now it's gonna take you 40 minutes to reload that.
[14:18.16]Hey!
[14:28.42]What is with this controller?
[14:31.32]What is going on?
[14:36.85]It's changing the direction every time I change the camera.
[14:49.03]Nature was cruel enough to play this trick.
[14:50.65]We already did that.
[14:55.26]Yeah, okay, so when I'm pressing down, it turns into left it.
[14:59.78]You know the deal.
[15:03.03]Taking a rifle to the chest is insane.
[15:04.75]I know.
[15:05.05]Do I have... Oh, stuff.
[15:11.47]You can get an assault rifle in the library?
[15:13.13]I don't need it.
[15:19.70]Alright, let me guess.
[15:20.30]Shoot me again.
[15:20.78]Remember this thing?
[15:25.10]Dude, that was messed up.
[15:28.05]Did you eat today?
[15:28.95]I did.
[15:29.21]I had a slice of pizza.
[15:32.25]It was scrumptious.
[15:42.39]Hmm?
[15:44.63]Hmm?
[15:50.52]This is gonna fall.
[15:52.94]There's no way this doesn't fall.
[15:55.32]No way.
[15:55.46]What do you want?
[16:13.08]Okay.
[16:13.50]I feel like there's another player.
[16:37.90]No!
[16:44.81]Alright, get the amulet.
[16:46.23]No, no, no, no, no, no, please.
[16:53.28]Okay, there we go.
[16:56.08]Let me move this out of the way.
[16:58.08]There we go.
[17:05.95]Got 200 bullets, who cares?
[17:10.58]Freeze!
[17:14.04]I thought that something was gonna happen.
[17:28.04]Okay.
[17:30.32]Can we please confront this person?
[17:31.79]This is stupid!
[17:35.03]Where- Can't I just yell to this person?
[17:46.68]Why can't I just say like, hey!
[18:02.27]Bro, I just accidentally closed the Twitch app.
[18:04.29]Dude, what are you thinking?
[18:14.34]Are we missing a cutscene?
[18:20.76]Where's the camera?
[18:24.07]Why is the camera over here?
[18:34.78]Yeah?
[18:36.50]I wonder what just happened.
[18:37.56]She has all the weapons.
[18:43.35]I didn't even get to do anything.
[19:04.87]It's a little quiet.
[19:14.68]Man, the game tends to do this.
[19:15.66]The voices in the game are not... Everything else is loud, but the voices are not.
[19:21.98]Okay, well, that's great.
[19:24.78]I'm really glad that I get to use the crossbow now.
[19:33.27]Just in case something fucked up happens, you know what I mean?
[19:38.74]Well, I'm glad he kept all these, because I need them now.
[19:43.72]So go to the atrium.
[19:45.76]Oops, I saved over it.
[19:48.15]That's wonderful.
[19:49.71]I better be a good shot with the crossbow.
[19:53.67]Because, um... I... that's all I have.
[20:02.35]Alright, head over to the atrium.
[20:03.55]Alright, let's go.
[20:05.38]Just gotta go the same way it went, right?
[20:18.23]So I gave all the healing items, all the weapons, I gave everything to the girl.
[20:23.03]And people warned me about this.
[20:24.90]They said, hey, be careful because what happens if you're only playing as the girl for like five minutes?
[20:31.70]And I said, there's no way that's going to happen.
[20:33.40]And that's exactly what happened.
[20:37.93]So that's great.
[20:50.47]Who is that geezer?
[20:53.07]Don't you dare talk about whatever his name is.
[20:58.82]Uh, we gotta go... Where's the atrium?
[21:04.76]Like, not this way, right?
[21:07.04]No, it's over here.
[21:10.90]Library.
[21:11.63]This way, right?
[21:17.59]They meant you.
[21:20.14]Well, they need to... relax.
[21:36.23]Okay, Atrium.
[21:38.49]This is it.
[21:39.37]Big deal.
[21:40.87]Time to fight a gigantic monster that we didn't get to see.
[21:48.20]I don't even know how to use this thing.
[21:59.33]Is it actually a boss time?
[22:02.73]I just fought two bears.
[22:07.05]Is it here?
[22:08.34]Is this it?
[22:10.68]Where is it?
[22:18.72]Is this a giant dinosaur?
[22:32.09]I linked the cutscene, the bones just fell.
[22:37.51]Oh, so we really did- Oh, we missed a cutscene!
[22:41.33]So I need to- Hold on a second.
[22:43.75]I can't alt-tab, the game will crash.
[22:48.79]You need to know where it happened?
[22:52.21]Oh, shit.
[22:52.63]Can somebody just tell me?
[22:53.41]Because if I hit the Windows key to drag my mouse over, the game will crash, probably.
[22:58.97]Just go where the bones are?
[23:09.36]You just saved?
[23:09.98]I don't care.
[23:14.98]Right here?
[23:17.38]These bones fell down.
[23:18.83]Oh!
[23:20.07]You found the Eye of Isis.
[23:23.45]I got it!
[23:31.62]What's... what is he doing?
[23:34.51]What is this walk?
[23:36.67]He's like... he looks like a dance.
[23:38.81]No!
[23:48.89]great uh so what is it did the entire game respawn oh my goodness this thing's actually pretty powerful two shots kill any zombie that's kind of insane run the head
[24:20.66]Nice miss.
[24:26.48]Nice.
[24:28.68]Does that mean you win?
[24:29.98]I think I have to put this somewhere.
[24:32.65]What, the natural history exhibit?
[24:37.85]Can I pick up the... Oh, stop.
[24:41.21]I can't get the arrows out of their heads and stuff?
[24:44.15]I can grab the arrows, right?
[24:46.02]That's like the whole point of this thing.
[24:51.05]Okay, so I have to go... I have the Eye of Isis now.
[24:56.60]Exquisite piece.
[24:57.14]You can only imagine the terrible price men have paid to acquire it.
[24:59.54]So I have it.
[25:00.50]Now this goes... into the Natural History Museum section?
[25:07.26]Go loot the old guy?
[25:14.68]Where did he die?
[25:20.57]Oh my god.
[25:25.25]Get away from me.
[25:29.99]Reload it!
[25:30.47]I have a lot of shots, so I'm fine.
[25:43.72]Good.
[25:44.72]One more.
[25:46.82]Oh, fuck you.
[25:47.38]How do you miss?
[25:48.38]He's right in front of you.
[25:53.11]Nice, okay.
[25:53.45]You have to go all the way back to the main door?
[26:01.83]You guys are gonna have to help me with that.
[26:07.82]The main door is... I don't remember.
[26:17.00]No help, no help, no help.
[26:19.22]No, we need helpers.
[26:20.78]I don't care.
[26:23.15]Good.
[26:25.49]I actually really need this.
[26:31.63]I took the lever.
[26:36.29]This device will enable you to restore power to the maintenance elevator.
[26:39.34]Oh my god, where was that?
[26:41.36]I remember that very vaguely.
[26:45.48]The maintenance elevator.
[26:47.52]There's nothing is labeled.
[26:49.92]I don't know where to go.
[26:51.36]Nothing is labeled, so... Head upstairs and go through the center doors that lead into the main stairway.
[26:57.20]Go upstairs to the central door on the upper floor.
[27:04.45]I'm so- This is awesome.
[27:07.05]This is the best way to experience any of these old games like this.
[27:11.80]You have to have a navigator.
[27:12.96]There's got to be at least one person with a map sitting in the passenger seat, at least.
[27:27.69]This one here?
[27:28.17]Will this open now?
[27:32.07]I don't think this was open before.
[27:36.93]He loves backseaters.
[27:38.38]No, no, no, no.
[27:38.78]That's not a backseater.
[27:40.72]This part, these, I'm asking for people to be in the passenger seat.
[27:44.54]Backseating means you're in the backseat yelling instructions when, no, that's a different, completely different criteria.
[27:56.66]Co-pilots.
[27:57.46]Yeah, yeah.
[27:57.90]There's like 10,000 co-pilots here right now.
[28:01.22]This one here?
[28:13.71]This one here?
[28:16.65]Oh, that one?
[28:17.19]That one?
[28:19.39]Hold on.
[28:19.67]Let me turn the map upside down.
[28:24.35]This one?
[28:32.93]If you're here, and I'm here, then who's flying the plane?
[28:35.81]Alright, so now... There's an elevator I need to activate.
[28:43.94]Is it right?
[28:45.58]Up and right?
[28:47.56]Like, up this way?
[28:51.58]Hang a right and go down the stairs heading east on the map.
[28:57.81]Are you sure?
[29:00.50]Are you sure?
[29:00.80]Because we passed that Wendy's already once before.
[29:03.04]I just want to make sure you understand.
[29:05.01]We've already passed that Wendy's.
[29:09.91]Oh.
[29:10.57]Yep.
[29:11.79]And then it's here.
[29:12.43]Oh my god.
[29:13.87]I shot that in his eye.
[29:23.34]He does not seem to care.
[29:24.36]Oh boy.
[29:25.38]Right in the same eye.
[29:30.74]awful I would okay after the okay after you get shot in the eye with one of these I feel like you start calling time out I'd start calling time out I'd be like okay time out time out time out for a second time out time out wait wait please I don't even know if you keep fighting I would just call time out and see if it worked
[30:01.06]It might work.
[30:03.68]If you saw somebody with a fucking arrow sticking out of their eye, it might be like, oh, okay, yeah, maybe we do a timeout here.
[30:14.57]Wish I had the gun.
[30:29.23]There's 2,000 people in the passenger seat shouting instructions and none of them are sober enough to know where to go?
[30:35.13]Yeah, all you hear is just clinking glasses.
[30:40.79]You just hear, like, I think it's the other way!
[30:45.57]Dude, that time's 1,000.
[30:49.63]Hey, do you know if we're gonna get fed on this plane or not?
[30:54.06]Is there a meal included?
[30:55.44]Sit down and shut the fuck up.
[31:00.32]that I would say over the intercom right now is that not for this?
[31:16.95]I really want Abdul to be here so bad
[31:28.40]Oh, get in there!
[31:29.10]How come it's not fitting?
[31:47.59]Just jam it in there?
[31:48.55]I can't!
[31:49.63]Come on!
[31:58.71]It's on the left side of the room?
[32:03.03]Wait.
[32:05.58]Oh.
[32:08.26]Dude, this thing looks like a fucking mailbox!
[32:10.16]I never would have figured that out.
[32:12.52]I would have quit the game.
[32:27.85]What?
[32:32.23]Shoot him!
[32:33.19]Shoot him!
[32:36.99]Is he dead?
[32:39.85]Yep.
[32:47.70]Alright, let's take the 50th one of these that I don't know what to do with it.
[32:55.49]Alright, so I guess we're going down?
[32:57.57]Let's go!
[33:03.39]I better not die because I actually have no idea how to... I don't even remember how to get back here at all.
[33:14.02]But we're going to enjoy it together, aren't we?
[33:15.42]What do you want?
[33:37.53]I got no more ammo for the first time ever.
[33:39.09]I've never had that feeling before.
[33:41.55]I don't like it.
[33:41.99]Now I have one arrow left.
[33:48.59]I think I have the broken baton, whatever this thing is.
[33:53.49]I don't think so.
[34:15.69]Truncheon.
[34:16.27]You don't pronounce the E. That's not Truncheon?
[34:21.57]Are you sure?
[34:30.68]Standard crossbow bolts.
[34:33.22]Is this one I missed?
[34:34.14]Are you sure?
[34:38.28]Are you sure?
[34:42.11]You ever tried installing The Sims 2?
[34:43.25]I don't blame the guy.
[34:44.61]Well, I... No, it's not that I didn't... We don't want to go back to those fucking two weirdos.
[34:49.69]Let's be honest.
[34:51.05]I would just start a new game.
[35:04.79]The plate lickers.
[35:05.87]Yeah.
[35:08.68]Just like, I'm gonna tell you, in canon, they both got hit by a bus.
[35:12.21]Okay?
[35:12.55]At the same time.
[35:13.07]Uh-oh.
[35:22.29]That was incredibly unlucky.
[35:28.43]Shit.
[35:28.99]I don't think I can kill these guys with just the baton.
[35:37.19]I can, and it was not that hard.
[35:47.20]Maybe not.
[35:50.72]Same bus or different buses at the same time?
[35:53.92]No, the same bus.
[35:54.46]Let me take a look at the map.
[36:12.87]Okay.
[36:13.85]Two different rooms.
[36:15.31]Let's check this one.
[36:17.65]Excellent.
[36:19.81]Were they inside the bus?
[36:20.91]No, outside the bus.
[36:27.95]Well, technically one of... Okay, they were doing like a... They were doing like a Mythbusters thing.
[36:33.20]Where they were like trying to see how fast a double-decker bus could go out in the desert or something.
[36:38.10]Whatever.
[36:38.38]Something weird.
[36:40.02]And one of them that was like holding the radar said, just said, drive straight at me.
[36:43.72]The bald one was driving.
[36:46.50]And the not bald one was holding the radar and he's like, drive straight at me so I can see exactly how fast it's going.
[36:50.31]They're not the brightest.
[36:52.67]And he'd drive, I think it was going like 100 and something miles per hour and just drove right into him.
[36:57.15]And then he just kept going off a cliff.
[36:58.93]He didn't know how to brake.
[37:00.11]He just didn't understand how to brake.
[37:02.01]So he just kept going.
[37:03.25]All he knew how to do was press the gas and he just didn't know what to do.
[37:05.89]And he just went right off a cliff.
[37:08.83]That's what happened.
[37:10.59]So stop asking about them.
[37:24.74]What was that?
[37:25.26]Scared the shit out of me.
[37:30.35]I hit the sides in operation!
[37:31.85]Let's take a look at the map.
[37:42.12]This is just a closed-in room.
[37:46.62]Any secrets?
[37:50.53]No?
[38:00.68]Ugh!
[38:03.84]That's disgusting!
[38:04.74]Is there really nothing in here?
[38:30.12]I kind of just realized he has a hair turd on his head.
[38:53.14]It stands up straight when he's angry.
[39:00.21]Alright, I think I got everything in here.
[39:04.67]I'm so done with him.
[39:09.70]With who?
[39:10.36]With me or with the game?
[39:11.62]Or with the guy in the game?
[39:17.46]You.
[39:17.80]Alright, see ya.
[39:39.07]There's a door back there that didn't go in.
[39:50.72]Which one is it?
[39:51.06]This one?
[39:55.94]You have to find Abdul.
[39:56.78]That's what I'm looking for.
[40:03.43]What happened?
[40:06.80]Now we need our, we need our friend and save point.
[40:09.08]Sewers below.
[40:09.64]Are you gonna be alright?
[40:39.50]Powerful weapon with tremendous range.
[40:41.99]Oh my god.
[40:42.47]Am I taking his only weapon though?
[40:51.85]This is his only weapon.
[40:59.82]Well, thankfully, that was 30 minutes of game time that we were never going to get back.
[41:05.85]If I were to die in the room outside of here, I would have just probably played Chrono Trigger for two hours.
[41:10.63]I don't know if I would... I don't know if I want to do that again.
[41:13.82]I love this game.
[41:14.86]I really do.
[41:15.38]I'm having a good time, but I don't know about that.
[41:31.19]Going to the sewer.
[41:34.05]It looks like a trap door.
[41:34.95]Where could it lead?
[41:35.47]I don't know.
[41:35.85]Open it.
[41:40.49]Okay.
[41:50.05]Save it again.
[41:50.57]So I've got to get to the train station from here.
[41:57.66]I'm actually really excited.
[41:59.00]Okay.
[42:01.27]I'm getting kind of excited about this.
[42:05.13]How many bullets do I have?
[42:05.79]60.
[42:05.81]Don't worry.
[42:09.21]Like, we could shoot this thing a hundred times, don't we?
[42:13.28]You got it.
[42:14.30]Alright.
[42:16.84]Stay here.
[42:17.14]Take care of yourself, Abdul.
[42:18.08]Hope I see you again.
[42:22.74]You're probably gonna die in the next cutscene, though.
[42:24.84]Let's be real.
[42:26.70]Oh, also, appreciate all the health and salves you've given me over the years.
[42:32.41]My father would have been proud.
[42:34.21]Because I'm proud.
[42:34.79]You understand?
[42:37.79]Take care of yourself.
[42:46.71]Can't get out that way.
[43:04.14]Wait, can I actually go in that door?
[43:13.35]No, I can't.
[43:13.91]That was really awkward, actually.
[43:16.47]Fuck.
[43:21.29]Did you should be an actor?
[43:22.17]Do you think so?
[43:27.12]Think I could make it in Hollywood?
[43:32.59]No, I'd crack in six months.
[43:35.18]I'd crack under the pressure in six months.
[43:44.92]You alright?
[43:58.89]You could do a regional theater in Pittsburgh, probably.
[44:04.67]I don't want to do that either.
[44:05.51]Let's go left first.
[44:17.14]Flamethrower?
[44:20.34]It's funny the game is giving me back all the items that I threw away.
[44:23.39]It feels bad.
[44:25.67]I guess it assumes that you may have given all the items to the girl?
[44:40.55]I still have this item.
[44:41.59]Okay.
[44:55.78]Could you do a chimp impression?
[44:57.10]Probably, but... I just did it.
[45:00.17]I just did it right there.
[45:18.82]A curse is on me now.
[45:20.94]Great.
[45:23.50]How much, what, how much damage does it actually do?
[45:30.03]Kind of a lot.
[45:31.43]It's filling up the whole entire, I was going to say office.
[45:36.91]I was attributing it to my office.
[45:39.03]That's why I was saying that.
[45:40.15]That was weird.
[45:44.35]Why is there no camera over here?
[45:49.01]I think I have to clear it.
[45:52.19]Shit.
[45:53.21]That sucks, but I have to.
[46:02.60]What is doing that?
[46:03.22]Is it an event?
[46:16.17]Don't even think about it.
[46:16.87]Okay, there's something here.
[46:18.64]Looks like a lever.
[46:19.38]Do you want to pull it?
[46:20.16]Yes.
[46:20.38]I think that's where I want to be, right?
[46:31.69]Did you move your recliner into your office?
[46:34.71]I thought about it.
[46:37.88]Trust me, Holly and I sat here as pretend engineers and blueprint analysis trying to find a way to make that happen.
[46:47.75]Oh, trust me, we had measuring tape.
[46:50.13]We were doing, we had like blocks of wood we were looking at.
[46:52.85]Maybe we could go to the Home Depot and make some.
[46:55.35]No, eventually it's just like, no, that's not going to work.
[47:01.63]Fuck.
[47:02.67]I wasn't looking at the screen.
[47:04.13]I looked at chat.
[47:05.49]I want to look back over.
[47:06.23]There's a guy in front of the screen.
[47:12.18]Imagineers.
[47:18.43]I'm fucking sick again!
[47:19.69]No!
[47:19.75]I'm gonna die from this.
[47:21.25]I'm gonna have to let it- ride it out.
[47:26.75]Wait.
[47:27.77]I'm taking one of these.
[47:29.47]I have so many of them.
[47:30.27]What does it do?
[47:32.73]It is- It's a duo- It's a double?
[47:35.54]It heals everything!
[47:38.17]Let this be a lesson to all of you.
[47:39.69]Listen up.
[47:40.57]Listen up.
[47:41.09]This is a lesson for all of you.
[47:42.53]You listening?
[47:43.78]Okay.
[47:44.82]Ah!
[47:45.78]What the fuck was that?
[47:47.10]What just happened?
[47:49.30]What's going on?
[47:49.94]Is it a rat?
[47:52.18]How do I stop it?
[47:56.76]Oh, do I shoot it?
[47:58.80]Get out of here!
[48:02.86]Okay, well, um... What was I just gonna say?
[48:11.15]It's not about... Oh, okay.
[48:13.49]Um... Use your items that you get in these games.
[48:16.59]Don't just guess and add... I don't know what it does.
[48:18.56]I'm afraid to use it.
[48:19.24]I don't want to use the grenades yet.
[48:20.72]What if I need them?
[48:22.96]I have, like, 50 incendiary grenades in Resident Evil 4.
[48:26.06]I just... I guess I won't ever throw one.
[48:28.48]Throw them.
[48:29.68]Throw them!
[48:45.67]They are like, they are attacking rats!
[48:56.88]Alright, did I get everything?
[48:57.70]Go down the ladder?
[49:02.33]Yeah, I know, I just don't want to, I don't want to miss it.
[49:04.25]I need to get items!
[49:05.13]I don't want to miss any items.
[49:13.94]What if I encounter a boss that's difficult?
[49:16.38]You still won't use them, I know you.
[49:22.86]This is electrified.
[49:28.58]What?
[49:30.10]Where, where are you?
[49:30.60]Look at these water physics.
[49:35.96]Wait, there might be items on the other side.
[49:45.27]Oh, what is that?
[49:48.47]What is that?
[49:51.59]What is that?
[49:52.79]Oh, hey, what is that?
[50:03.08]That probably would have killed me.
[50:05.26]I'm so glad I instinctively turned around.
[50:14.73]What does that mean?
[50:17.98]Oh, there's somebody there.
[50:21.40]Threadneedle Alley flood drain.
[50:22.94]Area must be cleared if personal between 6 and 9 a.m.
[50:34.73]I think I might just have to breathe through this.
[50:38.93]Oh no, it's gone.
[50:47.13]Can't run in this, by the way, so stop yelling at me to do it.
[50:50.47]Oh, what is that?
[50:52.37]That's a trap right there.
[50:53.19]Look at it.
[50:54.15]It's going to come down.
[51:01.36]This game is really screwed up.
[51:05.80]I really want to go down the other side, but I feel like I'm going to die.
[51:11.64]This has to be for a reason, right?
[51:13.20]There's no... Why would you develop this in the game?
[51:15.59]Somebody had to carve this out and add this.
[51:17.21]There's no reason why you would develop that and put time into developing this little corner.
[51:20.81]Something's going to roll down this like Indiana Jones.
[51:24.52]I told you.
[51:25.56]What did I tell you?
[51:46.65]So true, uncle.
[51:49.63]Why are you calling me uncle?
[51:51.95]I don't know if I like that.
[51:56.67]Don't say uncle.
[52:04.61]Why was that such a musical crescendo there?
[52:06.67]What was that for?
[52:07.17]Are we draining the water?
[52:21.97]okay okay so why okay alright gotcha scarier thing is right in front of me
[52:53.58]Get out of here.
[53:01.61]No!
[53:01.95]Alright, I'm sorry.
[53:02.81]I'm gonna have to start... Get away from me.
[53:15.84]Get out of here!
[53:16.70]Why won't they leave me alone?
[53:18.84]Can I step on them?
[53:23.04]I can't aim down!
[53:24.02]Let's go!
[54:02.23]It looked like a machinima that like a 13 year old would make.
[54:05.33]I know that because when I was 13 I probably made something like that.
[54:18.68]Have to use it.
[54:24.16]Just the different camera cuts.
[54:26.84]Don't.
[54:29.82]Die.
[54:49.65]Die!
[54:58.41]This thing is terrible.
[54:59.79]It just is.
[55:01.81]You ever accidentally talk to chat when you're not streaming?
[55:14.08]No, never.
[55:14.80]That's never happened once.
[55:20.75]There are times where I've done something in a game where I'm not streaming and I laugh.
[55:25.21]And I go, oh man, if I were streaming that, I think a lot of people would have thought that was funny.
[55:29.57]But no, I don't like turn to Holly and go like, oh hey, hey guys, hey chat.
[55:35.41]No, that does not happen.
[55:42.34]I can't knock that down.
[55:54.77]It does happen, but you're a sinner.
[55:57.93]What does that even mean?
[55:59.19]What are you even talking about?
[56:00.33]Something's going to jump out of the water.
[56:13.58]It's going to be like a zombie crocodile.
[56:15.82]Told you, look.
[56:17.42]Whoa.
[56:22.22]That did come pretty close to killing me.
[56:41.78]Can I blow up that barrel?
[56:45.96]Go down the ladder!
[56:46.62]Go down the ladder!
[56:47.26]Go down the ladder!
[56:47.86]Go down the ladder!
[56:48.50]I can't go down the ladder.
[56:49.82]I'm freaking out.
[56:50.40]I need to do something right now.
[56:51.50]I need to burn.
[57:02.65]Am I burning my face?
[57:16.68]Alright, please get out of the way.
[57:34.15]We're good.
[57:37.32]No, no, uh-oh.
[57:38.62]Uh-oh, no.
[57:39.34]No, no, I didn't like that.
[57:40.38]Uh-oh, uh-oh.
[57:56.08]I was trying to cough with the beat.
[58:07.73]I think that's it.
[58:17.01]There's so many rats down here!
[58:26.98]It's like where the whole family is.
[58:28.32]I have to run.
[58:38.21]I'm just running.
[58:38.63]I don't think you can hurt them.
[59:03.05]Silver key.
[59:10.12]No, dude.
[59:10.94]Don't do this now.
[59:18.32]That is not fair.
[59:19.94]That's spawn camping.
[59:21.36]Cutscene camping.
[59:22.48]Are you serious?
[59:22.98]You gotta be kidding me.
[59:25.51]You're gonna get cutscene camped?
[59:36.03]I got a pistol.
[59:37.75]There's no room in my inventory.
[59:42.00]How?
[59:42.22]What can I get rid of?
[59:50.72]Does it have like a bunch of stupid documents or something?
[59:56.89]Like what?
[60:00.99]What?
[60:01.15]How do I get rid of something?
[60:02.59]I want to throw away this.
[60:07.39]Shit, I can't take the pistol.
[60:08.69]Can I drop something?
[60:14.79]Leave the flamethrower?
[60:15.47]I don't even know if I can drop it.
[60:21.51]You can give them to Abdul in a little bit?
[60:22.98]Okay.
[60:27.14]Let me refill it at least.
[60:33.92]Uh, coming up on breakdown.
[60:38.15]And it's about a minute from now.
[60:40.53]We'll come back.
[60:40.99]We'll continue.
[60:43.61]This game is really good though.
[60:45.92]I'm surprised I've liked it this long.
[60:50.38]It is fun.
[60:52.08]Alright, I got a key.
[60:55.54]Let's not have that music on.
[60:56.64]I think I'm safe just sitting right here.
[60:58.80]I hope so.
[61:03.16]I'll be right back.
[61:04.58]See you guys in a few minutes.
[66:03.37]Have returned.
[66:05.63]It was the drug game.
[66:07.17]The drug game is schedule one.
[66:09.53]And it is.
[66:12.59]Game where I guess where you make drugs.
[66:14.79]I don't know.
[66:15.85]It's very popular right now.
[66:26.41]He said that with a dread.
[66:27.61]How we doing good?
[66:37.58]When are you going to play that?
[66:39.22]Um, maybe like a couple hours.
[66:43.01]That is going to be a stream with the horse men.
[66:49.87]So probably like a couple hours.
[66:51.43]I don't know.
[66:51.83]We'll see when everyone's around.
[66:59.19]Alright, I got a key.
[67:00.43]What is that key to, though?
[67:03.05]Hurry up and somebody fucking tell me.
[67:05.48]Sorry.
[67:06.42]I'm sorry.
[67:08.26]That was really uncalled for.
[67:09.26]This key seems to have been made fairly recently, but there is no clue as to where you could use it.
[67:21.44]Okay.
[67:22.38]Whoa!
[67:25.60]Don't scare me like that.
[67:28.13]That's an old joke from Elden Ring stream 6-2.
[67:31.93]You better read this one.
[67:35.27]Don't, don't, don't be like a joke holder or whatever.
[67:38.15]I don't, whatever the hell that is.
[67:46.16]Don't, do you get like the, the, the total joke bible from the last 15 years already?
[67:58.31]Okay, let's dump.
[68:02.21]I don't know.
[68:02.55]This thing's kind of good, but... No, let's get rid of this.
[68:06.04]This thing sucks.
[68:13.16]How do I give to... Okay, there we go.
[68:19.33]I'll take the arrows.
[68:21.19]But you... Take this stuff.
[68:29.91]Fine.
[68:30.31]Is this thing any good?
[68:35.09]Let's hold on before I make that commitment.
[68:41.55]Repeated multiple jokes from other jokes.
[68:43.69]Look, is it?
[68:46.82]Just just relax, OK?
[68:49.48]You make a reference to another stream that happened two days ago.
[68:52.22]It's part of the same.
[68:53.64]It's part of the same episode.
[68:57.57]If I reference something from when I played this four days ago, that's not repeating a joke.
[69:02.97]This is a continuation of this playthrough.
[69:09.80]And, by the way... I don't give a shit.
[69:13.48]Alright, I need to give him something else, too.
[69:31.89]I feel like all this stuff is too important.
[69:33.01]Maybe this?
[69:33.59]Yeah, get rid of this.
[69:38.07]Have I even used this once?
[69:39.23]I don't think I've used this one time.
[69:47.70]It's just kind of taken up a spot.
[70:01.21]The hamster is winning.
[70:05.29]The hamster's been playing for the last three days.
[70:11.66]I'll keep it.
[70:12.14]It's fine.
[70:13.60]Alright, is this thing good?
[70:16.40]Alright, silver key.
[70:17.34]I'm good.
[70:18.04]We got all of our stuff.
[70:20.06]I am excited.
[70:24.63]Where have I not gone down here?
[70:27.75]Behind?
[70:43.06]Hey, will you stream Death Stranding 2 when it comes out?
[70:45.34]Absolutely not.
[70:48.94]Absolutely no.
[70:53.51]That is an absolute 0.0.
[70:57.41]Chance for that to happen.
[70:59.25]Not a chance.
[71:04.81]I think I made it.
[71:05.27]Alright, I'm good.
[71:05.73]I'm here.
[71:05.97]You're going to explain yourself?
[71:11.51]Why do I have to explain?
[71:12.53]No, I just don't want to play that game.
[71:14.26]That's it.
[71:17.08]I have to explain myself.
[71:19.20]Yeah, alright, fine.
[71:20.04]I will explain.
[71:20.78]I didn't play the first one.
[71:22.20]Why would I play the sequel?
[71:23.38]Why would I stream the sequel when I didn't even play the first one?
[71:30.36]You're a Capcom lapdog.
[71:37.22]What is this?
[71:37.60]What?
[71:46.89]Where do I go?
[71:47.23]Oh, there's a door there.
[71:57.29]I thought this is where I came in from.
[72:02.06]That's a truth nuke.
[72:07.64]What are you talking about?
[72:10.98]Because I played Monster Hunter Wilds three weeks ago?
[72:13.82]Didn't mean it was fun.
[72:26.91]Wait, wait, wait!
[72:31.01]Wait!
[72:38.51]Does it use the same bullets?
[72:40.15]This gun is huge!
[72:43.49]Okay, if I fire this... This is really... I think... I don't think there's a good pistol etiquette here.
[72:48.22]If I fire this, it's gonna break my nose.
[72:51.27]This is gonna fly back.
[72:52.79]I'm gonna pull the trigger.
[72:53.91]It's going to flip in a tenth of a second.
[72:57.15]It's going to flip back and shoot me in the face.
[72:59.15]I have to force it with something.
[73:06.27]This mechanism has ceased.
[73:11.73]Whack it with this thing?
[73:20.02]Probably like a crowbar or something I get.
[73:22.00]Maybe.
[73:22.14]Yeah, tell me about it.
[73:27.98]Tell me about it.
[73:28.62]Clear.
[73:58.69]Yeah.
[74:04.69]I just want, I just want his stuff.
[74:10.65]They don't chase me, do they?
[74:20.24]You found a spanner, ooh.
[74:26.72]I probably drain this.
[74:27.64]Yep.
[74:28.48]Yep.
[74:28.94]Yep.
[74:29.39]Yep.
[74:29.83]Yep.
[74:40.94]You want to see every thumbnail I ever made?
[74:44.85]I'm not kidding.
[74:46.11]There was a point from like 2011 to like 2015 or 2014 where I made thumbnails.
[74:55.41]And eventually, I don't know if you guys remember Hypo.
[74:57.96]Hypo took over and did pretty much all of my thumbnails.
[75:01.26]Especially for Team Fortress.
[75:03.02]In like 2015 or so.
[75:07.35]I used to just do this.
[75:08.43]I used to just take a character and just go like this.
[75:14.90]If they had a weapon in the game.
[75:16.11]And then I would take a screenshot and maybe it would be a little angled.
[75:18.97]Like this.
[75:21.95]And then there would be text on this left side of the screen over here.
[75:24.83]Kind of like right where the gun is.
[75:27.39]Above it would say whatever the kind of title of the game was.
[75:31.33]They were so bad.
[75:32.25]They didn't grab anybody's attention.
[75:34.52]I just kind of... I needed to get... So it was always annoying to me.
[75:38.80]Making thumbnails on old YouTube just pissed me off.
[75:41.62]Because I got UD.
[75:42.32]I do the video.
[75:42.96]I finish the video.
[75:44.52]Maybe it took me three, four, five days to make one of these videos.
[75:47.30]Getting all this footage, whatever, right?
[75:49.84]Doing the thumbnail was always like, I just want the video to be uploaded.
[75:52.90]I don't want to fucking do this.
[75:56.77]And that's before that, you know, making like a face and five different times in the webcam could just go on every thumbnail.
[76:06.63]This was before that.
[76:13.64]I had to think this was the old, like, pog face.
[76:18.77]Facecam photo.
[76:22.73]Different versions of this.
[76:27.75]It was simpler.
[76:28.33]Okay, where is it?
[76:39.60]Where am I going?
[76:44.36]Wasn't it?
[76:44.66]No, it was right around the corner.
[76:45.82]It's in the same area.
[76:49.06]It's like right here.
[76:52.62]The pog face thumbnail.
[76:54.10]It's right here.
[77:05.96]That was before you sold out to Konami.
[77:10.00]I don't think I've ever played a Konami game on stream or on video.
[77:14.31]Ever.
[77:15.59]I don't think one time.
[77:17.95]In 15 years.
[77:18.53]I don't think it's happened once.
[77:28.92]Casino Inc.
[77:33.46]Does that actually count as a Konami game?
[77:40.45]That's exactly what a Capcom lapdog would say.
[77:43.10]I mean, okay, Capcom's been making a couple of bangers recently.
[77:52.44]What, Resident Evil 4 we didn't think was great?
[77:55.20]Monster Hunter was good.
[77:57.73]What are some other shit that they came out with in the last few years?
[78:00.21]We talked about it.
[78:00.81]It was like, oh man, Street Fighter was kind of fun too.
[78:11.03]Resident Evil 4 Remake was boring as AF.
[78:17.60]I thought it was good.
[78:18.26]What was wrong with it?
[78:19.18]It was fun.
[78:19.60]It was like, I thought it was good.
[78:23.35]This is going to be a disaster.
[78:24.27]Hold on.
[78:24.59]They should call you Shill985.
[78:32.58]Well, it's funny you say that, because this, uh, I want to announce a couple things here.
[78:37.02]This weekend, hey, get ready!
[78:39.55]Jermamites!
[78:40.95]This weekend, we're going to be doing some sponsored content!
[78:44.55]That's right!
[78:57.84]Actually, this weekend, there's gonna be maybe one or two sponsored.
[79:00.92]I'm not kidding, actually.
[79:01.96]I'm not fucking around.
[79:03.90]We're gonna do... W. Shill.
[79:15.51]Ster and I are gonna play Path of Exile 2.
[79:17.09]So that's gonna be fucked up.
[79:23.84]And it's gonna be sponsored, so that's fucking awesome.
[79:27.04]Ster and I have talked previously about, uh... playing it together.
[79:31.84]And I think he made the joke that the only way that I finally played Path of Exile with him on stream is if I was paid to.
[79:39.81]He just wanted to play Path of Exile.
[79:50.54]It was, like, so long.
[79:53.89]No, where'd that thing go?
[79:54.65]I need it!
[80:07.06]Is Ster sponsoring you?
[80:08.74]No.
[80:10.35]Ster is gonna be coaching me through Path of Exile 2.
[80:16.23]No, it's a real sponsor.
[80:18.03]It's really sponsored.
[80:22.89]But we're kind of just gonna fucking hang out and play it.
[80:26.45]I might do it.
[80:26.88]I don't know.
[80:27.22]Here's the thing, too.
[80:28.30]I want to also announce that also this weekend, ladies and gentlemen, we've got an Itch.io Horror Night planned for this weekend as well.
[80:47.21]Okay.
[80:47.49]Alright.
[80:47.69]So it's fine then.
[80:48.53]Okay.
[80:48.77]That's good.
[80:52.52]What is, like, sniffing?
[80:53.90]Uh, I still have, like, three or four horror games I want to play and a few more that I want to get.
[81:10.01]Because that was actually really fun.
[81:10.87]I had a really good time doing that.
[81:12.72]I just need a week or two cool down from doing that because it actually hurts my brain.
[81:16.34]I'm not making that up.
[81:17.32]It actually hurts my whole body.
[81:23.07]Yeah, what actually was that?
[81:32.42]Your brain and your chest, girl, you're going to explode and die.
[81:35.08]I'll be fine.
[81:39.77]But make sure you tune in to The Path of Exile 2.
[81:43.33]Streamed with Ster and Jerma.
[81:46.27]Sponsored, of course.
[82:03.37]Saw 1 and Saw 2 video games were made by Konami, by the way.
[82:08.15]Yeah, and they were fucking dog shit.
[82:18.16]Oh!
[82:27.58]I... yeah, I loved them.
[82:29.24]I did.
[82:31.06]I genuinely did love them.
[82:32.88]I thought that was a... Whatever.
[82:35.98]Let's see how the gun is.
[82:50.72]I don't know.
[82:51.34]Uh-oh.
[82:53.19]Uh-oh.
[82:54.89]How come they can run here?
[82:57.65]That's a little messed up.
[83:13.99]I mean, it's not bad.
[83:14.79]It takes a little while to kill anything.
[83:28.52]I also want to beat Chrono Trigger.
[83:31.52]There's a lot to do this weekend.
[83:32.52]Guys, I might even say fuck it and take a Marvel Rivals sponsor too.
[83:40.30]Like, who gives a shit?
[83:41.34]You know what I mean?
[83:44.31]Like, let's be honest.
[84:17.35]Have you seen all the Chrono Trigger endings?
[84:22.38]Um... I think most of them, yeah.
[84:35.70]You're gonna sell out hard before you retire to Mr. Green Island.
[84:39.26]No.
[84:39.89]That's not what's happening.
[84:41.69]I assure you.
[84:44.83]That's quite funny though.
[84:46.13]Ah!
[84:55.71]I don't think I want to be on Mr. Green's island.
[84:57.92]I feel like that would not be a fun place.
[84:59.56]Okay.
[85:17.67]But okay, listen, if I do sponsored stuff going forward, it's going to end up being sponsored segments.
[85:25.24]You know what I mean?
[85:26.58]We're talking like a couple hours and then we'll do something else.
[85:31.32]Long time ago, I was almost like, oh, if it's a sponsored stream, I have to make sure I did.
[85:34.35]It's got to be.
[85:34.83]I got to do the whole stream.
[85:35.69]I got to do it for the sponsor.
[85:39.86]No, like it would be literally like an hour or two.
[85:43.38]Path of Exile is a little different because I kind of, you know, not only do I really want to play it.
[85:49.32]I played it a little bit, but that's going to be a Ster.
[85:52.61]We'll be there, so we'll probably do it all day.
[85:54.03]What are they doing out here?
[85:58.43]I don't know.
[86:03.91]We'll see.
[86:05.09]I'm just doing whatever.
[86:06.93]You know, whatever.
[86:11.72]Whatever.
[86:13.40]Walk in, bro.
[86:14.06]Use the gate key.
[86:18.81]Alright!
[86:19.27]Is Monster Rancher still on?
[86:25.07]Oh shit, he is right here!
[86:26.17]Dude, how did you know?
[86:30.30]Did I walk right by him?
[86:31.24]There is no time to lose.
[86:42.97]I think we're getting to the end of the game, guys.
[86:45.89]This is fucked up.
[86:49.60]They have all the walkthroughs open.
[86:52.46]The amount of people just with the walkthrough open.
[86:56.84]I can't believe your parents are going to let you play Schedule 1.
[86:58.54]Do they know it's about selling drugs?
[87:04.64]Shut up.
[87:04.94]Shh.
[87:05.14]What are you doing?
[87:11.28]Okay, so I got that.
[87:17.08]Okay!
[87:18.60]Let's go do it!
[87:28.54]Also, because the Path of Exile 2 thing is going to be with Ster, I actually talked to Ster about this.
[87:33.47]That... It'd be kind of fun to do sponsor stuff with other people.
[87:39.71]And we kind of had a conversation like, hey, maybe it'd be fun if we just did sponsor stuff together.
[87:46.00]Make it more natural and actually more fun.
[87:49.26]We've talked about it.
[87:51.58]Is this a boss fight?
[88:05.58]There's been other things that have come through that...
[88:08.22]would have possible to have a sponsor on it, but I didn't want to.
[88:10.82]I didn't want to do it because I think there's been a few times where it's like, oh yeah, and I'm sponsored and fucking nobody else is.
[88:20.01]I just killed them all.
[88:20.91]No, I didn't.
[88:23.65]And I would rather do it with people, like kind of everybody as like a
[88:27.89]Let's call it a hand in the cookie jar.
[88:29.67]Rather than just like, hey, I'm sponsored.
[88:33.04]Okay, so ladies and gentlemen, today we're going to be playing this game.
[88:36.48]And you're not sponsored, but I am.
[88:38.82]Let's talk about the game and the gameplay that you see here.
[88:41.76]It's on Xbox.
[88:48.68]I'd rather stuff going forward be more natural, more fun.
[88:59.32]This guy.
[88:59.90]Am I going to execute this guy?
[89:09.71]I can't remember.
[89:10.15]Was Infinity Nikki sponsored?
[89:11.53]No.
[89:12.01]No.
[89:12.57]Nobody said it was sponsored by chat.
[89:22.92]He doesn't hear me loading it?
[89:27.96]Oh, I feel bad now.
[89:40.44]Explosive crossbow bolts?
[89:48.07]Is Ster going to cut the money?
[89:49.19]Oh, absolutely.
[89:50.07]A fucking hundred percent, yeah.
[89:52.16]Wait, what?
[89:52.72]You think I- You think I- Wait a minute.
[89:54.02]You guys think what I'm talking about is like, oh yeah, everybody, let's all get on a sponsor.
[89:58.36]Fuck all of you.
[90:15.01]Yeah, something like a game sponsor is like, easy to do that, I think.
[90:28.37]Please don't kill me.
[90:33.88]Yeah, stuff like, hey, um, the sponsor is to play this game for two hours.
[90:38.32]Do that with one or two other people or something?
[90:39.94]That's, I'm all, yeah, that's definitely something that just, absolutely.
[90:44.08]Absolutely.
[90:48.35]Okay, why can I not kill these two?
[91:00.61]You two are the hardest two shitheads in the whole game.
[91:03.11]If I die to these two, I'm going to put my hands through my screen.
[91:07.94]Have you ever genuinely hated a game that you were sponsored to play?
[91:16.44]I don't think so.
[91:19.15]I turned down a lot of things that I knew I probably wasn't going to like.
[91:24.68]Anything that ever came through, I always was like, I wonder if that's good.
[91:27.19]Let me see if I might like it.
[91:45.96]What about Wild Hearts?
[91:47.52]I actually thought the game was fun.
[91:48.92]I thought that was a fun game.
[91:49.82]I played it off stream.
[91:51.64]I didn't beat it, but I played it for at least another like two or three sessions off stream.
[91:56.21]I thought it was fine.
[91:59.19]What about Bush Light?
[92:00.09]No, hey, excuse me.
[92:00.99]We just, we just like that brand.
[92:09.03]Two to three seconds?
[92:10.11]No!
[92:11.85]Hahaha.
[92:25.51]This guy is alive!
[92:29.72]I only noticed because his head was moving around through the grate.
[92:58.79]Go past the trains and go up the stairs.
[93:00.09]I just want to make sure I didn't miss anything.
[93:07.98]I think I've honestly like been talking back and forth with the House Slipper devs.
[93:14.32]That probably will be like a kind of a more of a relationship there between the stream and that game.
[93:22.11]Because obviously, like you guys know, that is going to be... Hellslipper Invitational 3 is coming.
[93:28.01]It's going to be very different than the other ones.
[93:29.35]I actually think it's going to be better.
[93:30.57]Okay, I got everything.
[93:36.33]I think this is going to be the best one out of the three of them.
[93:38.58]Not because, oh, it's the best one, because it's the third one.
[93:42.24]There's some stuff that's probably going to be in that stream that just by its very nature is going to be interesting.
[93:56.33]But I might have like a larger kind of sponsored relationship with that group for a while.
[94:04.18]I don't know.
[94:04.52]We're still trying to get everything figured out.
[94:07.96]We'll see.
[94:09.30]But at the very minimum, House Flipper Invitational 3 should be... Actually, it's funny.
[94:14.56]I've been working on it for like a few months.
[94:17.50]Like what I would want it to be.
[94:19.03]Because I didn't want to do it again.
[94:20.97]I don't like to do anything again.
[94:23.57]Unless I think it's going to be actually fun.
[94:26.31]Because there's the theory that, oh, just do it.
[94:28.65]Because just do it.
[94:29.43]Because why not?
[94:30.25]Just do it.
[94:32.81]But I am actually very excited about it.
[94:40.50]So don't be surprised if you see some more House Slipper 2 stuff over the coming couple months.
[94:47.71]As well as the Invitational.
[94:51.43]I'm still trying to figure it out.
[94:53.11]We're locking it down.
[94:56.85]But like I said before, it's actually really... It's a weird feeling because...
[95:02.41]That game was just kind of a game.
[95:05.47]That House Flipper was just like a random fucking game that I just was like, oh, I'm gonna play this on Steam.
[95:09.17]It's just gonna be fucking stupid and funny.
[95:11.83]And like three or four or five years later, it's... It's actually wild to see.
[95:15.98]I hope they're doing well.
[95:23.26]They've been really fun to work with.
[95:24.40]They've been... Out of anybody that's come through the channel, it's been very easy to work with these guys, so...
[95:38.24]Bro, stop talking about sponsor money and lock in.
[95:41.63]I'm giving House Flipper invitational updates!
[95:49.93]Wanna let that guy live?
[95:55.66]I will, because it's gonna be too annoying to go chase after him.
[95:58.24]How does it feel to be Ster's mom's favorite streamer?
[96:05.58]Actually an honor.
[96:07.23]It's an honor.
[96:09.40]I mean it.
[96:10.08]That's an honor to me.
[96:31.16]Mom... Ster's mom approved.
[96:38.33]Oh, so apparently I'm about halfway through the game.
[96:42.23]Shit, really?
[96:43.59]I thought I was like almost done.
[96:50.60]I'm having fun.
[96:51.52]I don't care.
[96:55.94]Maintenance area.
[96:57.40]Personnel only.
[96:58.24]What?
[97:05.87]Did I miss anything?
[97:11.53]You may have regressed a bit.
[97:15.52]Yeah, I mean, I'm getting older.
[97:20.53]I naturally am going to regress every year until I'm dead.
[97:26.25]Who is this?
[97:45.57]Uh-oh.
[97:47.71]Oh, this actually is a boss.
[97:57.06]It's huge!
[98:01.90]I appreciate you made a boss arena for us.
[98:04.03]Thank you.
[98:04.35]Alright, let's see what the moves do.
[98:17.89]Oh, is there any Dark Souls boss you want to just see what the moves do?
[98:21.55]Before you get started?
[98:26.49]Wow, that was close.
[98:29.47]That was fucking close.
[98:32.76]This would be so scary.
[98:40.14]In the knee?
[98:46.14]Okay, aiming is so annoying.
[98:48.00]Yeah, I have to press R1 to change where I go.
[98:50.24]There it is.
[98:58.42]No!
[99:04.02]Got him!
[99:06.78]Got him!
[99:07.52]Why do they- that was so loud and weird sounding.
[99:15.85]Oh shit.
[99:18.71]Is it like Bowser?
[99:34.49]One more and I'm good?
[99:51.50]Oh, shoot him!
[99:57.88]What is fucking happening?
[100:06.73]More?
[100:08.19]How much more?
[100:08.79]I have to lock in for real?
[100:25.10]Reload the fucking gun.
[100:41.17]that was actually kind of tough creature appeared to be made from solid stone I'm sorry we were unable to help but there was no way we could get close you are brave young master Dane no doubt about that and I can only wonder where you found the strength to overcome that demon I fear however that what we have seen thus far tonight is but a warning there is even graver danger ahead I'm sure of it but we must not dwell miss Sutton swirl up my whiskey we must get after her follow me
[101:19.79]New area?
[101:20.29]Did I unlock a new zone?
[101:21.53]Southampton Docks.
[101:25.89]I really hope Abdul is not a twist villain.
[101:27.31]I like him.
[101:27.85]Yeah, that would be sad.
[101:28.65]Dear Lord, I hope we're right about this.
[101:47.35]Okay.
[101:47.75]All the items that I gave Ms.
[101:49.43]Sutton two hours ago.
[101:51.07]Abdullah, I gave her ten healing amulets.
[101:52.25]Why?
[101:52.37]Why did I do that?
[101:53.15]I wish I had them right now.
[102:25.31]It really wants to give this to me, but I don't, I'm not taking it.
[102:41.40]Oh, I also, I got the Indiana Jones game.
[102:43.18]Gonna play for like half an hour or something.
[102:46.23]That's probably enough to get through the opening cutscene.
[103:00.25]Do I have enough bullets?
[103:02.49]Yeah, of course I do.
[103:06.37]That game is so good.
[103:07.67]Okay, is this a weird thing where the licensed video game is actually really, really good?
[103:16.12]It's rare, but it happens.
[103:29.23]It's apparently goated.
[103:33.01]Okay.
[103:52.07]That sounds like my phone is sitting on my table right now and it's vibrating.
[103:56.73]I don't like that.
[104:06.91]I swear half these guys are friendly.
[104:12.88]Promised us an hour of Indiana Jones when we get in it.
[104:15.72]Very soon.
[104:16.66]Within the next, like, three days.
[104:18.06]And there's going to be a one-hour alarm for me to stop playing it.
[104:33.59]We have until we're going to listen to the entire Indiana Jones 1 soundtrack.
[104:38.20]When that is done, when we get to the roll credits song, I'm quitting the game.
[104:55.93]Why do you hate Indiana Jones?
[104:59.25]Hold on.
[105:05.99]Somebody just accidentally stepped on their instrument, because that just did not keep going.
[105:09.76]Is there anything more to this?
[105:24.15]Stop doing that!
[105:26.69]Wizard 101?
[105:26.95]Oh, Wizard 101!
[105:35.56]There's gotta be something better.
[105:39.65]Something better.
[105:40.93]There's gotta be something better.
[105:51.76]Oh, that was a good person.
[105:58.30]I just tried to kill this guy.
[106:01.04]It's the only guy that wasn't shooting at me.
[106:03.69]What?
[106:12.91]Wow!
[106:23.12]Yeah, you have to reload too.
[106:32.50]Ho-ha!
[106:33.22]Ho-ha!
[106:33.80]Ho-ha!
[106:37.44]Ho-ha!
[106:43.64]Stay away from the cargo hold?
[106:45.49]That's such a great Tim Curry movie.
[106:46.65]What the fuck?
[106:47.01]What's up?
[107:14.58]People always talk about the first handful of Muppet movies.
[107:18.24]It was that trilogy that was in a row that was Treasure Island, Christmas Carol, and Muppets from Space.
[107:28.65]I actually, I love, I really, really like that era of the Muppets.
[107:32.15]I think it's great.
[107:40.57]Of course, the original movies, the originals are classics.
[107:42.63]They're amazing.
[107:43.77]Unbelievable.
[107:46.42]But I do think that the later movies did really well too.
[107:52.90]What the fuck is a Muppet?
[107:54.04]You are just a liar.
[107:54.82]The Muppets are like Super Mario.
[107:57.36]It's like saying, what is Mario?
[108:13.73]Have you seen the Muppets Office parody?
[108:15.71]I've not seen any of the new Muppet stuff.
[108:19.60]I saw the new The Muppet movie that came out 10 years ago.
[108:25.20]I didn't see the other one.
[108:25.88]It was like The Great Muppet Heist or something.
[108:28.48]I don't remember.
[108:29.60]Are they aware that there's a bunch of shit going on in this boat?
[108:39.63]No, not the Great Muppets.
[108:40.49]Muppets Most Wanted.
[108:41.29]Yeah, Great Muppet Caper is great.
[108:43.79]I didn't see Muppets Most Wanted.
[109:00.60]Nothing?
[109:04.30]I have eight of these?
[109:05.58]When did I get so many of these?
[109:15.05]I'm going in.
[109:15.61]Okay.
[109:20.39]So do I, I don't have, where's the cargo hold?
[109:23.03]I think I've been everywhere.
[109:27.70]The Muppets office was so good.
[109:29.00]So sad.
[109:29.50]They didn't do more than one season.
[109:30.88]Really?
[109:31.20]Was it actually good?
[109:31.88]When did it come out?
[109:41.12]2015.
[109:41.20]Am I missing a key or something?
[110:09.62]Alright, this thing is ringing.
[110:14.05]Something with a bell?
[110:20.87]That was 20 years ago?
[110:21.75]Do you feel old yet?
[110:22.69]Dude, I felt old when they announced the Wii Virtual Console, okay?
[110:31.00]It's a little different than you think.
[110:41.18]What am I missing here?
[110:50.22]Can I go in this?
[110:59.07]That's old bragging.
[111:06.37]Okay.
[111:14.44]I'm older than you.
[111:15.28]I'm older than you!
[111:16.76]No, I'm older than you!
[111:22.37]Oh yeah?
[111:22.71]Did you even play the Atari when it came out?
[111:25.21]Did you play the NES when it came out?
[111:27.07]I played Super Mario Bros.
[111:28.13]1 for the NES when it launched.
[111:30.78]Did you do that?
[111:31.26]Oh, you played the digitized, remastered digital version!
[111:44.33]See, I told you, there's people fucking getting killed on here!
[112:02.68]Yeah, I- I played the real one, okay?
[112:06.19]That- that must mean that I'm better.
[112:07.69]You know how many times I died on Bowser, the last boss, trying to grab that fucking axe?
[112:16.07]Talk about Dark Souls is a hard game.
[112:18.60]You go do- you do that when you are seven.
[112:22.10]Dodging, dodge rolling underneath Bowser's fucking huge ass to grab that axe.
[112:27.16]Good luck if- you'd be lucky if you had one or two lives left.
[112:33.89]Yeah, as a six-year-old.
[112:38.21]I was trained in the art of video games and video game dodging since I was six.
[112:42.95]Okay?
[112:45.03]You jump over him, you're a noob.
[112:47.15]You didn't know that when you were six.
[112:48.68]You knew that when you were, like, twenty.
[112:51.90]Us six-year-olds, us seven-year-olds had to figure that shit out.
[112:55.00]From scratch.
[112:55.82]Alright, I've walked around in a circle on this boat, like, seven times.
[113:02.65]Where is this key?
[113:13.63]What did we have to figure out?
[113:18.23]Well... All you kids... Had to figure out... Architecture.
[113:24.75]And... Creating electricity from scratch.
[113:27.93]And inventing... Eventing electricity... With pistons.
[113:32.11]That ended up making your fast food restaurant that you made in your carnival map on... Um... You guys know a little.
[113:40.23]You know a little bit.
[113:43.55]Yeah, you have redstone.
[113:44.45]Yeah, you had to make electricity from scratch.
[113:47.55]You understand how hard it was to jump over Bowser when I was six?
[114:01.20]What is he talking about?
[114:01.90]Hey, don't even tell them.
[114:04.62]Don't give them the extra help.
[114:10.41]Where is this key?
[114:13.52]uh uh ladies and gentlemen this is your captain speaking I really would like to any of the passengers on board right now to scream the location of the key that I'm looking for be uh great if you could just please just just scream it as loud as you can into the uh I'll hear it I'm in the cockpit but I'll probably hear it I'm hearing a lot of no help no help and people screaming that that's fine do you think you're so funny that's great
[114:44.46]Somebody said it was up my ass.
[114:45.46]That's even funnier.
[114:46.62]You have any idea how hard it was when I was fucking younger jumping over fucking powder?
[115:02.87]You see the cutscene with the girl being held hostage on a boat.
[115:06.74]I don't know.
[115:07.82]I don't remember.
[115:08.38]I actually don't remember.
[115:09.52]I'm sorry.
[115:10.16]I don't remember.
[115:21.13]Do you like keto bread?
[115:25.39]Oh, we only eat whole wheat.
[115:28.08]I only eat whole wheat bread.
[115:33.02]Abdul, where's the key?
[115:37.44]Please, Abdul, help me.
[115:43.99]You kids eating your keto bread.
[115:45.37]No, I just, I eat wonder bread.
[115:49.65]It's white bread only.
[115:53.54]Run all the way to the end of the ship.
[115:54.86]Okay.
[115:58.98]I like the kind of bread where I can put my fingerprints in it.
[116:04.03]You know what I mean?
[116:05.09]I squish my finger down and I can take fingerprints with it.
[116:22.55]Do you like ancient grains?
[116:25.34]I don't know.
[116:25.78]I'm just talking shit.
[116:27.06]I'm literally just talking out my ass right now.
[116:32.57]It's called filling time.
[116:34.15]Looking for a key.
[116:35.45]The last three conversations have been complete nonsense.
[116:55.90]The key!
[116:56.62]It got to be nighttime!
[116:58.22]I can see the stars!
[117:08.51]The key is right there.
[117:09.55]You walk past it again.
[117:10.61]What?
[117:23.17]Front or back, there's a staircase you can go up for a cutscene.
[117:26.09]Thank you so much.
[117:34.86]You should see a crane and a guy and you talk behind an alcove to trigger a cutscene.
[117:40.38]Alright, so let's go try to find a staircase.
[117:52.86]Why is every stream sponsored?
[117:55.26]You think a 25 year old game is going to sponsor some asshole like me to play it this many years later?
[118:05.20]Actually... Is that really even a bad idea nowadays?
[118:10.56]Like sponsor... Sponsoring somebody to... Hey, remember this old game that was really fun that people liked that doesn't get a lot of traction anymore?
[118:23.28]That's, like, not even a bad idea.
[118:24.32]Did you win the game yet?
[118:34.57]Um, get, um, close.
[118:37.61]Uh, I... I can't believe I've been doing this for 30 minutes.
[118:45.17]I've been doing this for 30 minutes.
[118:47.12]What's wrong with me?
[118:48.10]Why can I not find this?
[118:50.10]I'm just having some fun.
[119:13.20]Where do I go?
[119:13.82]Where do I go?
[119:20.72]Need to look for the stairs.
[119:21.78]I'm trying to find stairs!
[119:34.51]It's out in the open on one end of the boat.
[119:37.29]Okay, there's the crane.
[119:41.53]What the fuck?
[119:42.13]Come on, man.
[119:42.67]Who is this?
[119:43.19]It's like penguin guy.
[119:43.97]I could have shot every single person up here.
[119:46.23]I could have shot that guy three times.
[120:09.42]I could kill him right now.
[120:10.66]I could kill him right now.
[120:11.30]I can kill him.
[120:11.70]You don't even have the gun reloaded!
[120:16.06]There's no bullets!
[120:30.50]The guy's like, oops, I don't want to deal with whatever's going on here.
[120:35.97]Okay, cool.
[120:42.14]This shit is locked.
[120:52.41]Now what?
[120:52.91]Alright, well I'm coming up on a break.
[121:01.61]Actually, I'm gonna get a new drink too.
[121:06.73]I gotta find the key laughing my F-A-O.
[121:12.33]This one works.
[121:12.87]I have explosive arrows.
[121:22.15]Alright, I'll be right back.
[121:22.81]Uh, we're gonna play this for another hour and then we'll do schedule one with the boys.
[121:32.16]See you guys in exactly three and a half minutes.
[121:37.28]Goodbye.
[127:21.00]What's going on?
[127:25.60]How you doing?
[127:34.42]Does this screen imply that you brew tea in your toilet?
[127:39.68]Whatever.
[127:43.95]Okay.
[127:45.09]I'm ready to move.
[127:56.01]Oh my god!
[127:59.30]That's horrible!
[128:00.38]That's terrible!
[128:07.86]Don't... I have ones that explode?
[128:11.14]How do I equip these?
[128:17.22]Is there a way to use these, like equip them?
[128:25.25]I want to put those on.
[128:26.21]I can't put them in.
[128:29.46]Bring an arrow to a gunfight is insane.
[128:35.06]Not if you're a good shot.
[128:36.20]Victoria?
[128:47.74]You removed her weapons?
[128:52.00]Who wants to bet that this guy is just an upgraded shit version of all these other guys?
[129:03.89]He's gonna miss just as much.
[129:05.53]Just as many times.
[129:12.70]I thought it was him.
[129:14.84]Oh, fuck.
[129:19.58]Get away from me.
[129:20.20]No, don't make this harder.
[129:22.10]Why would you want to be close?
[129:23.06]Alright.
[129:34.01]Everything's fine.
[129:34.59]We're good.
[129:36.13]Everyone can chill.
[129:42.94]Put these original ones back in.
[129:45.00]It's too close quarters for this shit.
[129:48.59]This is locked.
[130:05.20]I didn't go down.
[130:05.92]I didn't go down.
[130:18.85]there's gotta be something better something better
[130:45.97]Gotta be something better for me and me and me!
[130:51.17]Can you guys believe that during that era Kermit the Frog and Rizzo the Rat were the same guy?
[131:14.08]That's just crazy to me.
[131:19.95]What the hell?
[131:21.23]Ow!
[131:21.45]That was like the most blood I've seen in the whole game!
[131:42.85]He's not coming in here, don't worry.
[131:48.56]Give me a chance to heal.
[131:56.08]You know what?
[131:56.46]This thing is just way better than everything else.
[132:03.35]Never in my entire life heard of Rizzo the rat.
[132:06.31]What?
[132:07.11]There's no way!
[132:09.19]You are lying to me!
[132:13.23]That's impossible.
[132:17.51]Rizzo the Rat is one of the only Muppets that's still in every single property and everything that they do going forward in the last few years.
[132:31.83]Muppets are boomer.
[132:37.84]Man.
[132:41.44]There's kids who have never seen The Muppets.
[132:42.70]It should be required reading.
[132:44.15]You know what?
[132:44.51]You know, it's like, oh, Huckleberry Finn is required reading.
[132:48.23]And, oh, The Catcher in the Rye.
[132:50.35]We need to start having shit like this be required reading in schools.
[132:53.87]Wheel in the TV.
[132:54.89]We're watching The Great Muppet Caper today.
[132:56.49]It should be required reading in English.
[132:57.88]Can I pick this up?
[133:11.02]That's not reading.
[133:11.92]Okay, translate the whole thing and make it a book.
[133:13.60]And then bring the TV in.
[133:18.09]Do a few loopholes.
[133:22.99]Transcribe the entire Muppet movie and put it into a book.
[133:28.78]Hand it out.
[133:29.82]Say, okay, we're going to be doing the Muppet movie.
[133:33.12]The book.
[133:34.62]So make sure to take a look.
[133:36.16]Get your textbooks, please.
[133:37.08]Hey, who wants to do Fozzie?
[133:39.45]You go around, everybody gets... Who wants to be Kervit today?
[133:45.50]You do that for one chapter, then you wheel a TV and you go, oh, by the way, we're watching the movie.
[133:49.50]Take notes.
[133:50.36]And have a test on it.
[133:51.50]I would love to give a test on the Muppet movie.
[134:00.99]This guy, what's... That was kind of mean.
[134:21.48]My thesis on the Muppets.
[134:22.76]Did I just come from the same room?
[134:29.81]No, I did not.
[134:41.68]I can't open this door.
[134:46.78]Alright, cool.
[134:47.38]So, um, where are we going?
[134:51.78]Where have I not been?
[134:52.48]I haven't been up there.
[135:04.58]Where is it?
[135:06.04]To the right.
[135:17.21]Favorite Muppet?
[135:18.83]Uh, that varies.
[135:20.38]I would say it's probably Gonzo.
[135:21.34]I would say it's probably the Swedish Chef.
[135:25.40]Uh... Could be... The, um... The King Prawn.
[135:31.58]Okay, where do I want to go?
[135:37.32]There's another place to go this way.
[135:41.27]My throat is bothering me now.
[135:42.53]What's wrong with my throat?
[135:44.61]I get like a sore throat.
[135:45.49]What the hell is this?
[135:46.05]What is this bullshit?
[135:59.18]Oh yeah, don't get under the cargo bay.
[136:01.38]It's a mess down there.
[136:02.34]Don't go in that cargo bay for anything.
[136:04.14]No reason at all.
[136:15.05]Okay.
[136:18.11]Do one minute of no talking to heal.
[136:26.03]That's not a bad idea.
[136:26.73]Alright, no talking for one minute.
[136:30.66]I got to heal.
[137:39.67]This is the season to be jolly and joyous.
[138:05.94]Nevermind.
[138:08.57]wait hold on I got arrows got explosive arrows dude kaboom
[138:38.26]How is an explosive arrow weaker than hitting somebody in the head with a rock?
[138:47.47]Can we be real here for just a second?
[139:04.91]The explosions are too small.
[139:12.15]I did a bit, but there wasn't a timer going and he got distracted.
[139:15.25]Alright, let's do it.
[139:19.14]No, no, let's do it.
[139:19.94]Can I be quiet for one minute?
[139:21.42]No, let's make it easy.
[139:22.08]Let's make it harder.
[139:24.02]Can I be quiet for, uh... Something really difficult.
[139:27.66]One that actually kind of sucks.
[139:29.52]I feel like now ten is too long.
[139:31.68]Ten is just like, I'm not... That's not good.
[139:35.04]People will leave.
[139:35.94]People actually won't want to hang out here.
[139:37.36]That's a significant portion of the stream.
[139:39.70]Is ten full minutes.
[139:40.54]Five minutes.
[139:41.06]Fine.
[139:46.78]10 minutes is like 10% of an hour.
[139:48.52]That's a lot.
[139:52.95]We'll do 5 minutes.
[139:58.93]And by the way... I have to say something.
[140:01.73]It can't be like... But like... It has to be speaking.
[140:15.53]An hour is not a hundred minutes.
[140:19.17]Silence begins soon after you bet.
[140:27.55]10%.
[140:27.85]You know what I'm talking about.
[140:28.73]It's, it's, and exactly.
[140:29.85]You just, it's more.
[140:30.86]It's like, what is it?
[140:31.88]15%? 16%?
[140:48.46]1 and 6.
[140:48.98]Yeah, so, but... Alright, you guys ready?
[140:57.03]I'm not gonna mute myself.
[140:58.19]I am... I am... a man of honor.
[141:01.81]Not muting.
[141:02.43]A man of honor.
[141:06.72]The microphone is right into my face.
[141:09.28]Okay, and starting in...
[141:17.14]Three, two, one, now.
[142:32.27]Oh.
[142:44.09]Oh, Darian, I'm so happy to see you.
[142:46.13]But you've taken an awful risk coming here.
[142:48.25]You still have the statue?
[142:50.07]I knew you would.
[142:51.43]That evil collector Bupo must not lay his hands on it.
[142:54.93]But something he said troubles me.
[142:57.42]It can wait.
[142:58.38]Listen, we must find out where we're heading.
[143:00.52]I think the crew may help us.
[143:01.82]They're prisoners, just as we are.
[143:03.52]Follow me, quick.
[143:39.98]There's probably a way below deck from here, but it may be hidden.
[143:42.76]Quick, help me find it.
[143:50.75]There's probably a way below deck from here, but it may be hidden.
[143:53.55]Quick, help me find it.
[145:05.31]Hahahaha!
[145:31.52]Did he fall down the ladder?
[145:45.94]Did he fall down the ladder?
[145:48.62]No, honestly, what happened to him?
[145:50.18]I have to talk about this.
[145:51.36]What the fuck was that?
[145:54.72]That was more than five minutes too, by the way.
[145:57.87]Was it not five minutes?
[145:58.89]That was the longest five minutes of my whole life.
[146:03.28]Why?
[146:03.82]What happened?
[146:04.76]Why did I fall down?
[146:06.18]Dude, it was so hard.
[146:09.73]It was so hard because you have no idea.
[146:18.83]In the first 10 seconds, I look over a chat and I just see somebody say, Gonzo is a fucking loser.
[146:24.32]I was gonna write in chat and just tell the person to go fuck themselves.
[146:28.48]But, like, that was making me laugh.
[146:31.58]It's not possible.
[146:33.73]I had 45 seconds, and then he, the guy fall, like, I've, okay, I've taken shotgun blast to the head.
[146:40.54]I've had, I've been eaten by zombies.
[146:42.00]I've had mummies grab me by the throat and scream in my face and put poison down my throat.
[146:47.48]I go down a ladder, and on the last rung of the ladder, one or two maybe inches off the ground, I sprain my ankle and die, and I'm on the ground, and that's where the cutscene is.
[147:07.35]You wanna try again?
[147:07.97]Should we double or nothing?
[147:15.04]No, so many people- Wait, I'm playing as the other character!
[147:19.28]Don't I have like a hundred bullets?
[147:22.52]Um, where's all my shit?
[147:24.44]I'm pissed!
[147:27.52]Where's all my- Where's all my stuff?!
[147:31.04]I'm actually fucking pissed!
[147:33.50]She has nothing!
[147:35.40]She had a hundred heals!
[147:38.36]Did they say what happened?
[147:39.66]She got robbed!
[147:41.68]Oh, alright, we're fine.
[147:42.64]We'll get it back in five seconds.
[147:43.72]You guys want to go again?
[147:50.67]You don't pay attention?
[147:51.47]I- we just had a very large... ...happening happen here.
[147:56.55]Yeah, sorry, I didn't listen to the- Oh, I- I was robbed!
[148:00.88]We're talking about Gonzo, and I wasn't lo- Yeah, I wasn't paying attention to the cutscene.
[148:04.56]Neither were you.
[148:16.59]We are watching the stream, why are you doing this?
[148:20.97]What do you mean, we are watching the stream?
[148:23.97]Actually, I gotta check and see... How's the horseman chat doing?
[148:28.32]I just saved it so if it crashes it's fine.
[148:33.64]I know we were gonna get started in...
[148:40.70]Like 20 minutes or so.
[148:41.66]I want to see.
[148:42.24]Because I started streaming a little early.
[148:44.22]I'm going to play this for a little bit.
[148:46.72]What's going on?
[148:47.22]Let's see.
[148:47.70]What's the deal here?
[148:48.24]I think like half an hour.
[148:54.32]So I got about 30 minutes.
[149:02.53]You started early.
[149:03.19]Left my ass off.
[149:03.75]Poke started at 9 a.m.
[149:04.61]Damn.
[149:13.49]I want to do more morning streams.
[149:15.23]I feel like that'd be fun.
[149:18.91]I say that, but then I get to the point where... Yeah, we got about half an hour or so.
[149:24.58]We did not crash.
[149:25.20]That's a good thing.
[149:27.56]In the mornings... I'm just so tired.
[149:32.10]And talking about Gonzo and stuff does not... That is not part of the... The repertoire until at least 1 to 2 o'clock in the afternoon.
[149:43.16]I can type, and it's easy for me to talk, talk, talk, talk, talk by typing that early, but being like, just having energy, like any energy at all, not I'm saying that I have to have a ton of energy, but I kind of need to shake the cobwebs off for the first few hours.
[150:02.63]Alright, so I am, what am I looking for if I would have missed the, all the cut scenes?
[150:07.52]I think this is a stealth segment.
[150:13.14]I don't know, something happened to that guy.
[150:14.60]I don't know what that was.
[150:27.87]I might as well just take what he has.
[150:29.93]Okay, yeah, he did have a weapon.
[150:46.04]Maybe there'll be a morning stream one day.
[150:50.52]Yes, I would like to access the inventory.
[150:52.62]Thank you very much.
[150:55.73]I'm going to take half of these.
[151:12.30]Here we go.
[151:16.51]What am I doing?
[151:17.03]Just do it on a weekday.
[151:20.53]I want to watch while I'm working.
[151:24.85]Maybe if I feel like it.
[151:26.98]You may see.
[151:29.08]Maybe.
[151:30.06]Probably never.
[151:32.00]A early morning Pacific stream.
[151:34.10]Probably never.
[151:36.36]Ever.
[151:37.72]But it could happen.
[151:39.39]Maybe.
[151:39.55]Maybe.
[152:05.19]This game is actually kind of scary.
[152:08.31]Why is my jewel pulsing?
[152:09.79]Is this like a hot and cold meter?
[152:13.69]Am I hot?
[152:14.63]Am I close to whatever?
[152:32.30]Life preserves, however your drowning would seem to be the least of your problems.
[152:37.68]We're doing a blinker on stream.
[152:43.66]Alright, looking for a supply closet apparently.
[152:58.15]Everything is locked.
[153:00.49]Uh, this left room maybe?
[153:02.62]Maybe?
[153:13.75]What's making that sound?
[153:17.89]Is that the game?
[153:23.16]Why is the game making a ticking sound?
[153:26.60]I don't like that.
[153:27.46]Get that off.
[153:41.85]I don't like that.
[153:44.01]Get that clock bullshit out of here.
[153:49.14]Digital clocks.
[153:50.02]Digital clocks only.
[153:51.22]Okay, um... Go to the left.
[154:27.80]What the heck outta here?
[154:31.40]Okay, everything is locked.
[154:36.15]I guess I could go in that room up there.
[154:37.37]Okay, so I need to go left, left, right.
[154:43.60]So, left, left, right.
[154:53.05]This is locked too.
[154:54.59]Wonderful.
[155:04.23]This one opens.
[155:04.77]That's great.
[155:25.48]Good thing I wasted that.
[155:26.48]I'm really happy about it.
[155:28.36]Alright, so every door is locked.
[155:35.69]Besides, I guess, straight down?
[155:37.03]I mean, that's gas down there, too.
[155:46.98]Bang a... Behind me?
[155:47.76]Bang a right?
[155:51.06]I mean, should I just walk through it?
[155:52.50]And who cares?
[155:53.02]I guess I can go this way.
[155:59.09]I was already here.
[156:14.76]Alert.
[156:15.64]Find weapons in storage supply room.
[156:17.18]Look on map.
[156:17.90]She is in the hall on the left.
[156:19.70]Top side of the map near stairwell A. Go to the room on the right lower side of the map, just left of stairwell B.
[156:42.45]How do I get over to stairwell B?
[156:45.67]Bring a right up here?
[156:49.85]Oh, I can go this way.
[156:55.66]I'm going to drain all these.
[156:57.42]This stinks.
[157:16.45]Die!
[157:17.71]And give me some heals.
[157:29.40]Why is he so surprised to see me?
[157:30.64]Okay.
[157:35.15]Flamethrower.
[157:35.73]Alright, finally.
[157:36.51]Give me this shit.
[157:46.51]Pistol.
[157:51.39]Anything else?
[157:54.07]This sucks so bad though.
[158:07.61]Why do I have to breathe in all that gas over there?
[158:10.99]Super annoying.
[158:16.82]Alright, I'm good.
[158:18.04]Uh, where am I on the map?
[158:23.27]Bang a left and then bang a left.
[158:25.59]Can I shoot this off?
[158:42.11]I must find a key.
[158:44.09]Wonderful.
[158:48.68]Straight down.
[158:49.78]Can I go straight down?
[158:51.76]I thought it was blocked off too.
[159:00.05]They're all going to get up.
[159:04.59]Or... What was that?
[159:07.15]Why was that showing me that?
[159:20.01]Maybe he has the key.
[159:24.30]Interesting.
[159:27.51]That door didn't open though, what the?
[159:53.00]What?
[159:53.46]Oh, this is the captain's quarters.
[160:00.72]Dude, pause the game for eight hours.
[160:01.86]I have to go to bed.
[160:02.38]You can get up and watch the VOD.
[160:16.73]Alright, where the hell was that?
[160:17.99]Where's that guy showing me?
[160:19.23]Down... He's by the... by a staircase.
[160:22.82]What staircase is this guy at?
[160:25.29]This one's straight ahead to the right?
[160:40.28]Yeah!
[160:42.54]Ouch!
[160:43.24]Ouch!
[160:44.82]Ouch!
[160:46.64]Ouch!
[160:50.70]Alright, where's that stairwell key?
[160:54.26]I'm still poisoned.
[160:59.75]Straight, left.
[161:04.79]I can't fight you right now, I'm poisoned.
[161:09.92]Straight, left, left.
[161:26.22]Cargo ah.
[161:30.77]Really?
[161:39.42]This one on the right.
[161:47.60]It's like somebody shooting again.
[161:48.60]There's no idea how to shoot a gun.
[162:00.83]Please drop something.
[162:05.67]I might actually have softlocked myself by getting poisoned when I didn't.
[162:09.63]I shouldn't have.
[162:19.68]You found a padlock key.
[162:22.86]Bro.
[162:24.32]None of this.
[162:26.24]None of this right now.
[162:29.16]I gotta find a... I gotta find something right now.
[162:36.17]Get off!
[162:46.38]Shit!
[162:47.30]This is not good.
[162:49.40]You better have a heal on you.
[163:03.46]Hurry, hurry, hurry!
[163:04.12]Come on, come on, come on!
[163:12.58]Go to the stairwell.
[163:13.25]This is the stairwell here, right?
[163:19.85]Alright, I'm in the stairwell.
[163:29.20]I need an ointment.
[163:30.74]I need ointment.
[163:42.05]Deck one?
[163:47.15]This is not right!
[163:53.34]All the way to the top?
[164:00.95]Look for Cargo Bay Key.
[164:02.37]Wait.
[164:02.73]Oh wait.
[164:03.03]No, no.
[164:03.25]Is that right?
[164:05.43]I'm dead.
[164:05.79]I'm dead.
[164:06.01]I'm dead.
[164:06.29]I'm dead.
[164:06.53]I'm dead.
[164:06.85]I'm dead.
[164:07.19]It's over.
[164:08.61]I have nothing.
[164:11.23]I got poisoned like nine minutes ago in the game and I'm still poisoned.
[164:19.50]Where is it?
[164:21.02]Straight ahead?
[164:24.52]And maybe the yellow arrows are good actually.
[164:26.46]That's not what's... There's no labels!
[164:31.94]On Deck 1, look for Cargo Bay to use the key on.
[164:35.92]Shit, it's over.
[164:39.02]No!
[164:39.82]Cargo Bay!
[165:00.55]Alright, well this time I'm not gonna get poisoned.
[165:04.03]All this shit I gotta do again.
[165:05.88]Uh, how we doing?
[165:18.02]I actually might call it here.
[165:19.53]And move over to schedule one.
[165:23.21]That stinks to die there.
[165:24.43]It's all good though.
[165:37.92]Let me type and see how people are doing here.
[165:42.00]I'm not done with this game.
[165:43.18]I'm having a lot of fun with it.
[165:57.71]Seeing if we're good in like 15 minutes.
[165:59.35]I could do it again.
[166:01.33]If we're still about 15 minutes away.
[166:03.39]Plus I can hit a break too.
[166:04.87]So then we can have an hour of uninterrupted
[166:15.80]You were two hallways away from another Abdul spot?
[166:19.02]Shit.
[166:20.80]I might just speedrun it right now.
[166:31.84]Alright, let me speedrun this, because I think we still got about 10-15 minutes.
[166:37.40]Before everyone's here.
[166:52.36]Five minutes no talking again?
[166:53.38]We could try it.
[166:57.39]Although that sucks because I can't ask questions to you guys.
[167:14.26]Alright, let's try it.
[167:15.76]So...
[167:24.61]I need to get... God, I wish my memory wasn't a fucking goldfish.
[167:29.84]My memory's not even that bad.
[167:31.08]It's just, like, remember... It's like I'm writing over everything by talking to everybody.
[167:37.60]And I have way more fun talking than anything else.
[167:39.94]But there may as well just be, like, a robot controlling the character sometimes.
[167:54.07]Alright.
[167:55.78]No, I'm not done.
[167:57.16]I need to get all the heals.
[168:06.46]His body's laying on the ground right here.
[168:09.65]Give me all your shit.
[168:10.67]I need it.
[168:11.35]You know what?
[168:11.91]We're gonna take it all.
[168:13.17]I don't care.
[168:19.43]Why am I even taking these?
[168:32.94]Wait, whose inventory is this right now?
[168:34.58]Mine.
[168:35.04]Okay.
[168:36.68]I'll take eight.
[168:38.88]Take this thing back.
[168:39.99]Why am I even taking it?
[168:42.63]I'll take 60, 50 bullets.
[168:48.27]What else you got?
[168:50.07]Give me this shit.
[168:53.33]That's alright.
[168:55.59]Okay.
[168:55.83]He has the crossbow.
[168:56.63]He's got all these explosive things.
[168:57.87]That's fine.
[168:58.35]Okay.
[169:00.14]Okay.
[169:05.90]Wait.
[169:07.32]What's going on here?
[169:09.16]Who has this?
[169:10.08]Wait.
[169:10.92]Give this to me.
[169:14.62]What did I get the pistol from?
[169:15.64]Alright, so let's go.
[169:19.92]Save it again.
[169:20.44]I took everything from Abdul, right?
[169:27.46]Give me all this.
[169:28.63]Wait.
[169:29.05]Yes.
[169:32.06]It's so confusing.
[169:32.74]So, like, enter is A on the fucking keyboard, but it's... I'm using a controller, so... It's very confusing.
[169:41.44]Okay, let's go.
[169:42.50]Save the... Just get out of the menu!
[169:50.19]I'm gonna freak out.
[169:50.91]Alright.
[169:55.81]Fuck you and fuck this.
[169:58.11]Let's go.
[170:03.45]Alright kill stuff get keys got it Just open up every door
[170:30.94]There's a bucket of water I need.
[170:32.88]I remember that.
[170:40.27]The graphics hold up really well.
[170:41.33]They actually do.
[170:41.97]Actually, it's a pretty nice looking game.
[170:44.91]I can't go that way.
[170:50.20]Can't go any... But I want to get them mapped out, though.
[171:00.47]They gotta get on the map.
[171:07.70]Okay.
[171:09.54]Looks good.
[171:10.22]My throat is so messed up.
[171:11.34]What is going on with my body?
[171:14.40]I drank a tea this morning too.
[171:15.86]What's going on?
[171:16.98]Alright, one of these has... There's a jump scare right here for those of you that weren't here five minutes ago.
[171:25.33]Careful.
[171:44.60]Poison is the worst thing in this whole game.
[171:46.00]Alright, refill the container if I need it.
[171:56.39]Oh, good.
[172:02.29]Anything else in here?
[172:04.24]No, I think we're good.
[172:05.50]Keep moving.
[172:17.68]I really want to like drink a beer right now.
[172:19.32]What's going on here?
[172:23.34]I want like a ice cold beer.
[172:26.30]Why?
[172:33.49]Did I subliminal message myself?
[172:36.45]By pretending to drink and saying that I drink bush light every day?
[172:41.17]I think that's what happened to me.
[172:44.84]I advertised a brand to myself.
[172:52.60]Subliminally.
[172:53.18]Alright, I got the water.
[172:56.73]It makes the dripping sound.
[172:57.75]We're good.
[172:58.19]Alright, I'm going to save it again in a minute here.
[173:02.19]I remember there's a cut through.
[173:06.21]Yep, I remember this.
[173:10.46]None of these open.
[173:11.50]I kill the guy here and he drops the key.
[173:15.04]He goes, oi.
[173:17.90]Wait, what?
[173:21.86]Where's this guy?
[173:23.62]Where's the guy that goes oi?
[173:34.90]This way.
[173:40.43]This guy goes oi.
[173:42.09]Yeah, there he is.
[173:55.88]When did Dermot start thinking tea was a cure-all?
[173:57.76]I don't think... Wait, what?
[174:01.95]I just like tea.
[174:27.39]And we're not even going to get to see it.
[174:30.67]We're going to have to see that next time.
[174:39.21]Alright, then this doesn't open.
[174:40.92]Are you sure it doesn't open?
[174:43.70]Okay, and then there's a guy.
[174:46.72]There's the guy on the ground in the stairwell.
[174:50.40]We get the key, we come back here.
[174:54.70]Not poison, so everything's good.
[174:58.27]That guy is right.
[175:01.95]Isn't he right here?
[175:02.59]How do I get in there?
[175:06.59]No, he's at the other stairwell across the way.
[175:09.09]Down here.
[175:16.77]Check what keys you have.
[175:17.49]I don't think I have any keys yet.
[175:19.01]I'm about to get one.
[175:21.89]By going behind me.
[175:24.21]Okay, so there's no smoke here anymore.
[175:35.50]Very good.
[175:36.50]Wait, did I go down here?
[175:37.54]There's a cargo bay door here.
[175:51.11]Get this.
[175:56.86]Thank you very much.
[176:01.86]Cargo bay door.
[176:05.27]People get up now.
[176:09.19]Scary monsters.
[176:11.01]Yep, there you are.
[176:11.91]I think he has the key that I'm looking for.
[176:32.82]Padlock key.
[176:34.10]Perfect.
[176:34.48]Let's open the padlock door.
[176:36.38]And then I'm going to save the game.
[176:40.52]And we'll be ready to go next time.
[176:47.56]Because I think if I go up here.
[176:56.29]Go to the cargo bay door.
[177:02.79]Should be at Abdul.
[177:04.83]And then I'll save it there.
[177:16.66]Several doors leading to the cargo bay.
[177:18.10]This key may not fit them all.
[177:19.46]So it's the one that I saw before.
[177:20.44]Alright.
[177:25.45]I think I'm just going to go back to Abdul and save it here.
[177:31.74]Isn't he right here?
[177:32.70]He's down the hall, isn't he?
[177:40.67]You're almost to Abdul.
[177:41.47]Let's go back downstairs and save it.
[177:46.17]Yeah.
[177:47.17]Yeah, it looks like we're getting ready to... I'm going to hit a break here and we're going to get started.
[177:57.14]Shit.
[177:57.56]Okay, I've got to go this way.
[178:00.11]Blow off the horsemen and finish this game.
[178:04.55]No, I'm not doing that.
[178:05.47]I want to play the drug game too.
[178:07.89]Alright, so down here straight to the left.
[178:10.29]Takes us down the stairs.
[178:19.44]And then go down.
[178:20.50]Deck two, right?
[178:27.36]Now we're... now from here...
[178:33.56]Abdul is where?
[178:36.78]Straight down to the right?
[178:37.52]Is this a Silent Hill map?
[178:47.71]I just wish anything was labeled.
[178:50.62]Down to the left?
[178:55.06]They're all waiting on you right now.
[178:57.82]I'm gonna be- I'll be three minutes.
[179:08.16]Fuck, where's Abdul?
[179:09.08]Somebody please help me.
[179:09.94]I don't want to hold my friends up.
[179:11.64]Where's Abdul?
[179:24.52]I need a save point.
[179:25.14]I need a save point right now.
[179:27.19]Cargo door?
[179:29.95]Is it right here?
[179:41.85]Okay.
[179:43.11]Where's it?
[179:43.43]Deck 1, top right?
[179:47.63]Deck 1, top right?
[179:53.78]Down this hall towards the camera.
[179:55.88]Everyone's gonna be so mad at me.
[179:57.96]Stop freaking out.
[179:58.80]I have to freak out.
[180:01.32]Oh shit.
[180:05.18]I found it.
[180:06.12]Abdul's right here, right?
[180:09.04]Yeah!
[180:18.74]That was 20 minutes we'll never get back if I didn't do this.
[180:23.54]Alright.
[180:24.80]I'm going to take a break.
[180:25.52]I'll be right back.
[180:26.52]I'm going to join this call and we're going to play schedule one.
[180:29.59]Alright.
[180:29.93]Settle down and relax.
[180:30.87]We're good.
[180:33.47]Be right back.
[180:34.89]Actually, I got a minute.
[180:36.93]Let me at least get the game open.
[180:46.72]Okay, let me do this.
[180:48.36]Get out of here.
[181:00.08]Okay.
[181:04.05]Very nice.
[181:09.43]I'm going to tell them I have to pee and then we'll get started.
[181:12.03]So let me just tell them I have to pee.
[181:20.01]Opening up schedule one now.
[181:29.68]This game loud, should I be careful?
[181:30.94]Alright, I'll be back as I'm going to play.
[181:44.61]I'm going to jump in this call.
[181:45.57]I will see you guys in three minutes.
