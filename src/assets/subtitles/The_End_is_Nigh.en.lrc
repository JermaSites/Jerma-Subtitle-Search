[00:50.99]Yeah, we know how the intro goes.
[00:55.18]Hi guys.
[00:55.68]I'm not happy.
[00:57.40]I'm starting this one off already in the doghouse with myself.
[01:01.38]And when I say myself, I mean companies.
[01:04.90]Some company.
[01:05.54]You know, fucking companies.
[01:11.31]It's always a company.
[01:12.11]I'm always talking about a company.
[01:18.51]We'll talk in a minute.
[01:22.23]This is Jerma from Screensheet.
[01:25.14]The only one.
[01:33.28]So we know it's not Meat Boy.
[01:35.40]No, it's not Meat Boy.
[01:37.78]Comcast?
[01:40.76]No, not Comcast.
[01:45.43]It's something else.
[01:47.37]I will go over the story.
[01:48.35]I'll go by it.
[01:49.05]It's going to be angry.
[01:52.95]Do I like any companies?
[01:56.15]Do I?
[01:58.33]I don't know.
[02:02.06]Maybe like... Warner Brothers?
[02:09.86]Maybe.
[02:11.81]I don't... No, no, no, no, no.
[02:13.35]I wasn't a fan of the fucking Last Bugs Bunny movie.
[02:28.45]You know what?
[02:29.70]I do like a company.
[02:31.58]Amazon.
[02:33.34]Amazon is like a great company.
[02:36.14]There you go.
[02:40.24]Hello.
[02:41.00]Welcome to Friday.
[02:43.32]Are you kidding me?
[02:45.86]I just told you I took that back.
[02:53.56]Look, I bought something on Amazon and it came in two days for free.
[02:59.34]That's pretty cool.
[03:05.90]Anyways, let's skip the intro here.
[03:09.40]Actually, no, I gotta explain what fucking happened.
[03:12.18]I gotta explain my miserable... I gotta explain, in quotes, every day is misery for Jeremy.
[03:19.19]End quote.
[03:21.61]Because I say it like this, it's like, fucking add it to the list.
[03:26.11]Couldn't even scale that fucking fence in time shift?
[03:29.29]Misery.
[03:32.25]Let's just get this off.
[03:34.77]Let's move.
[03:37.02]Okay, that was weird.
[03:37.88]Move over here.
[03:41.54]We've got our capture device.
[03:44.20]There is our end.
[03:45.42]And it's currently nigh.
[03:48.28]There we go.
[03:49.18]Okay.
[03:51.24]Nope.
[03:53.66]Uh, it's a disaster.
[03:55.18]Let me make sure my other thing is there.
[03:59.18]Which it is.
[03:59.82]Uh, this song, by the way.
[04:06.33]I've heard this song before.
[04:07.27]I don't know, like, where it's from.
[04:08.55]I feel like I've, like, seen this or heard this song before.
[04:15.14]Anywho.
[04:17.27]So this is a good backdrop for when I talk about how much I hate everything I do.
[04:22.64]When it comes to my personal life.
[04:26.22]Make sure options are good to go.
[04:30.26]Sound effects volume, music volume.
[04:31.70]I think this is fine.
[04:34.12]Customized controls, gamepad controls.
[04:37.61]Jump is... I'm sure it'll tell me... I'll know all this shit in about five minutes.
[04:45.09]Alright, so...
[04:47.44]Remember how I was talking a ton of shit about the Scarlet Solo?
[04:50.54]Were you guys here for that?
[04:55.86]I talked a ton of shit about Scarlet Solo.
[04:59.02]It's a USB audio interface.
[05:01.94]And now I, like, take it back.
[05:04.07]I take it all back.
[05:06.39]I never should have said those things.
[05:11.09]Uh, this one.
[05:11.93]This one's fine.
[05:15.21]Ash dies alone.
[05:17.68]Live.
[05:18.06]Is this like a YouTuber?
[05:19.58]What is going on?
[05:40.77]Wait, am I playing though?
[05:42.16]Wait, what?
[05:43.68]Oh, shit.
[05:44.64]Oh, no!
[05:45.32]No!
[05:45.98]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[05:46.96]No!
[05:47.46]Oh, fuck!
[05:48.88]Oh, fuck!
[05:50.16]Oh, god, no, this can't be broke.
[05:51.44]Here, let me get the cartridge out.
[05:53.34]Is he streaming?
[05:54.44]He's streaming to zero viewers.
[05:55.22]Okay.
[05:55.38]Come on, man.
[05:55.66]Oh, no!
[05:55.78]It's still not working!
[05:56.28]Oh, fuck!
[05:59.99]Fuck, what am I gonna do?
[06:04.74]Fuck! Ow!
[06:09.85]It's just like your stream.
[06:16.53]It's just nothing works.
[06:18.28]Nothing fucking works in a Jerma stream.
[06:20.64]That wouldn't be surprising.
[06:21.72]This is me.
[06:23.54]There was some kind of apocalypse and all that was left was me.
[06:27.92]That sounds funny.
[06:31.04]All in all, you know, it hasn't been so bad.
[06:34.19]Until yesterday.
[06:35.98]My favorite game cartridge finally broke.
[06:38.50]You are fucked.
[06:39.66]You are, Jeremy, you are fucked.
[06:42.19]I'll have to go out there.
[06:44.45]Outside.
[06:47.54]Turn the volume up?
[06:48.36]Uh... Okay.
[06:49.40]Teeth.
[06:49.74]Okay.
[06:49.88]So I gotta repopulate the world.
[06:51.96]This is fucking... The end is nigh.
[06:54.00]Is this like... Is this Edmund McMillan, like, just doing this voice?
[07:18.92]So this is me.
[07:21.88]Find more game carts.
[07:24.80]Okay, I don't have any game carts.
[07:27.30]There's a jump.
[07:28.99]Very obviously.
[07:30.87]Is there like a wall jump?
[07:33.51]I don't think there is a wall jump.
[07:34.89]This is not Meat Boy.
[07:36.05]It very clearly says that in the title.
[07:39.43]Tap X. Hold X to go higher.
[07:42.65]Yeah.
[07:45.78]I got a tumor.
[07:47.40]When I wasn't dead, I used to hang on corners and stuff.
[07:50.80]Just like hanging out.
[07:52.60]Get it?
[07:54.00]Please don't die.
[07:54.98]Alright, so you can hit your face on a corner like that.
[07:59.78]Bring yourself up.
[08:02.28]Any corner.
[08:02.72]I can do this to any corner.
[08:05.94]Interesting.
[08:06.46]Okay.
[08:09.98]Like that one.
[08:11.12]Okay, keep going.
[08:16.11]The title says it's not Meat Boy, but what does your heart say?
[08:20.89]Not Meat Boy.
[08:22.11]It's very obviously not Super Meat Boy.
[08:29.01]Okay, so what is the point of this?
[08:31.51]What's the main goal of the video game right here?
[08:34.16]Just get to the end?
[08:35.82]Fuckin' easy.
[08:39.43]Uh, I guess you could collect all the... When I used to hang off a wall, I'd pull out from it and then I'd do a jump and go like super far.
[08:49.51]But when I didn't pull out, I'd mostly just go up higher.
[08:53.60]I call it the pull-out method.
[08:56.16]Made that one up years ago.
[08:57.74]I imagine it would get more of a laugh.
[09:01.81]It didn't.
[09:02.29]Please leave me alone.
[09:03.43]Alright, so... Yeah, that's it.
[09:06.72]Okay.
[09:07.44]First death.
[09:08.78]Go ahead and count it.
[09:09.74]Yeah, try to count these deaths, guys.
[09:12.14]I'm not gonna be able to.
[09:13.02]Okay.
[09:16.52]Is there a secret?
[09:17.35]No.
[09:21.67]This is to pick up tumors.
[09:23.63]That's the name of the game.
[09:29.36]Easy enough.
[09:32.04]Don't worry, the game counts for you.
[09:34.70]Uh-oh.
[09:36.87]Wait a minute.
[09:37.45]I gotta get the choomer.
[09:39.07]Got it!
[09:47.99]Whoa!
[09:48.91]I just fell.
[09:52.62]Jump on it, and then... Oh, shit.
[09:56.00]Okay, I'm good.
[09:57.78]How do I get that one?
[10:01.54]Wait, go back.
[10:02.74]Uh... How do I, like, jump up there?
[10:08.30]I can't... I don't know.
[10:08.94]I don't know if I can get that one yet.
[10:17.06]Oh, God.
[10:19.78]Oh, God, it's over.
[10:21.44]I didn't go fast enough.
[10:23.16]Okay.
[10:23.46]We gotta go fast.
[10:35.30]Three?
[10:35.66]Why are we saying three?
[10:36.74]Three what?
[10:37.36]Three, three, three.
[10:41.66]Fuck.
[10:42.34]Oh, it's all over.
[10:43.32]Drop.
[10:48.21]Get it!
[10:49.85]Ah, shit.
[10:50.33]I need to get it.
[10:50.81]It's like the band-aids in Meat Boy.
[10:52.55]You have to get them all.
[10:56.57]Got it.
[11:00.08]Frog champ!
[11:04.79]You gotta see, I used to play Meat Boy a lot.
[11:08.37]Me and Burger Boy beat every Dark World level six times each.
[11:12.51]Or we weren't allowed to eat.
[11:15.23]Oh fuck.
[11:15.97]I missed it.
[11:17.00]Wait, can I get it still?
[11:19.36]No, I missed it.
[11:31.70]Nah, I missed it.
[11:33.37]Ohhhh.
[11:38.00]If you get a tumor, you can go back to the start to claim it, not just the end.
[11:41.64]Oh, so it's not like the Band-Aids.
[11:44.94]Ow.
[11:45.48]Oh, it is like the Band-Aids.
[11:46.48]I want that.
[11:50.79]Damn it.
[11:54.27]Shit.
[11:54.71]Come on.
[11:55.25]I really want that one.
[11:58.17]The music is pretty good.
[12:01.04]Who made it?
[12:01.72]Uh... Doc... What's his name there?
[12:05.66]Yevski?
[12:07.80]Fuck.
[12:12.63]Stop doing a death counter.
[12:15.07]Whatever.
[12:16.57]I tried.
[12:16.99]And I died.
[12:20.69]Yeah, I told you guys you're not gonna be able to count deaths.
[12:29.01]Oh, that's how you get this one.
[12:31.26]Where is it?
[12:31.62]I don't know, I'm scared.
[12:34.82]I'm actually, I'm scared to get it.
[12:39.60]Oh, god damn it.
[12:43.59]Just go, finish the level.
[12:52.51]I can't believe we're actually, like, no, we're not, no more counting deaths.
[12:55.70]It was, it was a funny joke.
[13:00.76]But I didn't even tell my story about how angry I am right now.
[13:04.74]Oh, a little too high.
[13:10.34]Is that a key?
[13:13.54]Uh... Oh, I got a really itchy eyeball.
[13:20.87]We get a Grandpa Plays Dark World for the old days.
[13:23.55]Hold on, let me see this.
[13:27.39]Ugh.
[13:32.20]Thank you, Felix, for the cash.
[13:37.78]Felix gave a dollar.
[13:41.86]If I had a nickel for every time Jerma has ignored my sub or bit message, you would have given me $5 or $20.
[13:48.39]I don't know.
[13:49.57]How much have you given me?
[13:51.41]You're going to damage your eyeball?
[13:52.61]I'm going to be fine.
[13:53.79]I'm going to be alright.
[13:56.11]It's not my first rodeo.
[14:00.89]Yeah, like a typical, like, shit gamer would have just died right there.
[14:05.32]Not me.
[14:08.46]There's one thing I can guarantee you is that I have, like, Meat Boy skills, okay?
[14:14.24]I do have skills in the realm of Super Meat Boy.
[14:22.33]Tell the... Oh, is it gonna come back?
[14:23.45]It's not.
[14:34.13]Um... Oh, shit.
[14:36.77]Sorry, we oi-ed it.
[14:40.59]It's not fucking Meat Boy.
[14:44.65]I know.
[14:45.03]I wonder if I... Oh, god damn it.
[14:56.42]Okay, we're alright.
[14:57.54]Everyone's fine here.
[14:58.80]Oh, no.
[15:03.34]I need to get to 20.
[15:07.12]Ah, hit with my fucking forehead.
[15:12.03]Just can't touch anything.
[15:17.93]What?
[15:18.17]I didn't even touch it.
[15:32.80]My god And like I had a fucking bad day today too like why am I playing this right now?
[15:40.84]I had a fucking terrible day and like let me play that game.
[15:44.25]It's like fucking impossible that like Dave McMillan made I don't give a fuck with leaving this area.
[15:53.45]I'm gone.
[15:53.86]I'm gone.
[15:55.48]I don't care.
[15:56.16]Oh
[16:04.04]That was fucking hard when I did the first try.
[16:06.61]But can I go through?
[16:11.79]Why am I looking over at the chat and jumping?
[16:16.78]That was such a mistake.
[16:18.04]What was the point of that?
[16:18.96]What does that do?
[16:26.59]The Arid Flats.
[16:27.37]Warpoint unlocked.
[16:28.31]I can go back.
[16:30.95]Let me explain my day.
[16:33.09]After I read this dialogue.
[16:33.97]Oh, hey.
[16:34.85]Them's the remains of our ancestors down there.
[16:40.53]The guts are all connected underground.
[16:42.82]At night, I can hear them whispering.
[16:45.88]Help us, we're burning in hell.
[16:48.10]Or something like that.
[16:49.16]It's hard to hear them over my own screams.
[16:51.94]Anyway, it's like some kind of tunnel system.
[16:54.28]So when you find a new one, just remove the scab, hop in, and boom.
[16:58.47]You're home.
[17:02.83]Home where?
[17:03.77]The end.
[17:05.11]Iron Flats at the end.
[17:09.63]Oh, there's one here.
[17:10.63]What the fuck is that?
[17:15.75]Go, go.
[17:17.45]I hunger.
[17:18.91]300.
[17:19.05]Must be blood.
[17:20.01]Must be fresh.
[17:21.69]Feed me.
[17:24.19]So I need 300.
[17:24.81]Three, uh, whatever.
[17:32.14]Okay.
[17:32.38]I don't have any cartridges.
[17:38.45]Feed me, Seymour.
[17:40.42]Find the pieces.
[17:44.70]Okay, well... Wait, the... Oh, shit.
[17:51.04]Can I not get back up there?
[17:54.23]Wait.
[17:55.91]I can't get back up here.
[17:56.59]I have to do the whole thing again.
[18:12.05]Okay.
[18:14.13]That would have been awful.
[18:16.86]So let me explain my bad day while I try not to die.
[18:20.78]So I got up.
[18:22.10]I got up with like... You know when you wake up late and you have like a bad headache?
[18:27.54]You know when you wake up really late, it's like a... You get that groggy feeling in your brain where like everything sucks and like you want to just go back to bed, but you can't because you're an adult.
[18:38.88]You're an adult male.
[18:41.13]And you have, like, responsibilities as an adult, right?
[18:43.29]Like, I have things I have to do.
[18:45.55]I gotta mow the lawn.
[18:46.35]I don't have to mow the lawn.
[18:47.21]That's a lie.
[18:47.75]I'm lying.
[18:48.15]I'm lying to you.
[18:49.57]But I have, like, things I, like, need to do as a human being.
[18:55.69]So I get up.
[18:57.17]And... The day, like, got a little bit better.
[19:01.71]I had some food.
[19:02.60]I felt a little bit better about, like, my brain hurting.
[19:04.28]And... Shit.
[19:04.58]Shit.
[19:10.62]And I went, and something I've wanted to do for a long time is to get a new USB audio interface.
[19:17.14]Right?
[19:18.06]Fuck!
[19:20.79]So, I've been complaining about this USB fucking audio thing that I have.
[19:25.23]Because it sucks.
[19:26.37]And I keep having problems with it.
[19:28.37]And finally, I go to the store, and I get all these recommendations.
[19:32.05]Like, the nice gentleman at the store that I went to gave me, like, a thousand different suggestions.
[19:37.92]He's like, oh, you use that one, we'll try this one.
[19:39.76]Right?
[19:41.70]And I bought this USB audio interface.
[19:45.37]It was a ton of money.
[19:47.27]And when I say a ton of money, it was a ton of fucking money.
[19:51.09]And the guy looks me in the face, and I'm not kidding, this is fucking real.
[19:54.97]This is a real story.
[19:57.53]Guy looks me in the face and says, let me just tell you something.
[20:03.18]There are no returns on this item.
[20:07.12]And my naivety, right, my brain, uh, decides to say, sure.
[20:13.34]I'm like, sure, yeah, that's no problem, that don't matter, I don't, I'm fine.
[20:20.01]Wait, what happened?
[20:20.55]Oh my fucking god.
[20:24.67]Hold on, middle of the story, cr-
[20:29.67]Criken just hosted me with like 30,000 fucking people or something.
[20:33.60]What?
[20:34.74]Criken!
[20:36.34]Hi, Criken.
[20:38.70]Hi.
[20:39.34]Thanks for like the 4,000 people.
[20:44.84]I hope I can... I hope I can entertain you guys.
[20:49.34]Thank you, Criken.
[20:52.06]Thank you very much.
[20:56.06]Release the Criken.
[20:57.56]And you came right at the perfect time, and I was just complaining.
[20:59.70]About, like, my life.
[21:04.35]But welcome, everybody.
[21:05.37]I don't know what a Criken was just playing, but... We're playing The End is Nigh.
[21:11.33]We got 3,000 new friends!
[21:14.74]We'll continue that in a second.
[21:15.94]Would you like to see your fate?
[21:17.42]This ride requires 50 lifetimes of suffering to enter.
[21:21.10]Please return when your tumors have grown.
[21:23.51]We'll be waiting.
[21:24.65]Okay.
[21:25.63]Sure thing.
[21:27.45]So, look.
[21:28.11]So the guy tells me, behind the counter, that this audio interface, for some reason, is un-returnable.
[21:35.62]Guys, I've never bought a product in my entire life that was not returnable.
[21:41.75]It's like underwear.
[21:42.61]You know what I mean?
[21:43.03]Maybe underwear.
[21:44.01]If you buy underwear, you can't bring it back, right?
[21:46.27]If you go to the store, you go to fucking Target or something, and you buy like a sleeve of underwear.
[21:50.79]Yeah, you ain't bringing that back.
[21:53.18]But this is like a USB audio interface.
[21:55.80]It's not fucking like a pair of like skivvies, you know what I mean?
[21:58.80]Wait, wait, there was a dead guy over there.
[22:01.72]I don't know what he said.
[22:05.87]Any video game ever.
[22:09.18]But regardless of this, it was extraordinarily expensive.
[22:12.44]I bring it back, and I hook the whole thing up.
[22:15.24]And, like, me and Etalyx were supposed to play Just Cause 3 multiplayer mod.
[22:18.44]Nobody's playing it.
[22:19.66]Like, yeah, that just, like, that shit in the can and, like, fell down and rolled down the hill way before, like, I even thought it was gonna happen.
[22:26.75]So, like, that got canned.
[22:28.39]And I set up, it took like an hour and a half to set this fucking thing up.
[22:31.77]And what's the problem?
[22:33.71]Because it's a certain type of audio device, I can't run it through OBS.
[22:39.31]I can't, it will not be picked up by any.
[22:42.21]Are we creeping out the new viewers?
[22:43.45]Yeah, well, whatever.
[22:47.66]But long story short, I can't get it to work for what I want it for.
[22:51.16]And I can't return it.
[22:53.18]And it was a fucking ton of money.
[22:55.04]So what do I do?
[22:56.11]Go back and be like, hey, you told me I couldn't return this.
[22:58.75]But, uh... I am.
[23:02.45]I don't understand.
[23:04.97]I'm being told to shush.
[23:05.85]Okay, I'll be quiet.
[23:06.71]There are others close by.
[23:08.65]Crazies who believe in what they call the Ascension.
[23:13.20]They hide just out of view.
[23:14.44]Some are above.
[23:16.06]Some below.
[23:17.43]Don't try and find them.
[23:18.99]And definitely never speak to them.
[23:21.03]Stick to the linear path, kid.
[23:22.81]Exploration can only lead to disappointment.
[23:25.39]I explored myself once, and now I'm dead.
[23:28.15]Think about it.
[23:28.63]Huh?
[23:32.51]Could I resell it?
[23:33.23]I mean, I could.
[23:35.49]Should I, like, go down there?
[23:36.45]That's a really odd hole.
[23:41.50]I'm gonna have to go down it.
[23:45.83]Go down.
[23:48.86]Jesus.
[23:49.60]Come on, man.
[23:50.02]You can't just, like, slime down that hole.
[23:55.78]Come the fuck on.
[23:57.18]This is like... This is threading the needle.
[24:02.58]I think I'm too fat to fit down here.
[24:04.95]Got it.
[24:06.39]Oh, do... What?
[24:10.37]Where do I go from here?
[24:11.03]Shit.
[24:13.01]Shit.
[24:18.93]I guess this way.
[24:25.16]Okay, cool.
[24:26.86]I can't go talk to that guy, whoever that guy is.
[24:29.98]Can I swim?
[24:32.78]You can swim.
[24:34.10]Good to know.
[24:35.86]Oh, sh... No, I didn't even get the... I didn't even get the... I didn't get the secret.
[24:46.84]I went all the way down there.
[24:50.85]I'm kind of an audio geek, so I like this stuff.
[24:54.97]Well, apparently, because it's a DAW, I believe is what it's called.
[25:00.15]That's my understanding.
[25:01.73]Like, OBS can't take them.
[25:04.95]Plus five tumors.
[25:06.37]That's a mega tumor.
[25:07.31]Okay, well.
[25:09.73]More story?
[25:10.35]Well, that's pretty much the whole story.
[25:11.91]I got it all set up.
[25:17.75]Calm down.
[25:32.79]Alright, that text that comes up on the screen needs to, like, get the fuck out of the way.
[25:44.56]If the text... Shut up.
[25:49.39]Shut up, Jeremy.
[25:58.85]Alright.
[26:02.53]OBS in 2017, what do you mean?
[26:04.91]What else would I use?
[26:08.44]I had virtual audio cables, but that introduces input delay.
[26:12.84]There's audio delay that I have to compensate for.
[26:14.95]And doing that, wait, what is this?
[26:16.89]R2.
[26:20.27]Hey, kid.
[26:21.51]You ever want to grab corners while running?
[26:24.12]It's easy.
[26:24.62]All you gotta do is be ducking while you are running.
[26:27.12]Your body will just snag on the corner every time.
[26:30.44]It's a classic tactic I used to use to escape from my urges.
[26:33.63]Don't worry, we are nice now.
[26:38.73]Oh, so it's like holding shift in Minecraft.
[26:40.59]Don't ask me why you need to use that.
[26:48.80]The Minecraft shift.
[26:51.60]Ow.
[26:57.36]Can I duck?
[26:58.80]No.
[26:59.62]Of course not.
[27:03.55]Oh, I guess I gotta get on the other side here?
[27:05.73]I guess.
[27:12.93]JermaCraft mentioned.
[27:19.04]I'm not going to do it again.
[27:19.70]Just don't fuck it up.
[27:25.48]It actually is scaring me, even though I know I'm holding down R2.
[27:27.48]It's not going to kill me.
[27:36.75]Alright, let's go.
[27:42.09]Sonic the Hedgehog Springboard.
[27:43.35]Nice.
[27:55.44]Oh, the end is nigh.
[27:56.92]Oh, the end is... Nigel Farnberry!
[27:59.32]Remember that thing that was on the internet before?
[28:03.14]I've seen it before.
[28:08.32]I guess we go that way.
[28:11.40]Why is Mario referenced now?
[28:15.70]What?
[28:16.14]What's the matter?
[28:16.74]Can we go down this one?
[28:18.73]No, what about this one?
[28:21.71]Minus... I'm not... That wasn't even... I wasn't making a joke, guys.
[28:24.15]I was just... Wait, oh, there's a tumor over there.
[28:30.65]Just like Meat Boy, you gotta trust your fucking instincts.
[28:33.91]Trust it.
[28:34.99]I just said, you just gotta go.
[28:37.58]No waiting around.
[28:38.28]The more you sit there and think about what you're gonna do, the harder it is for it to be for you.
[28:45.26]You know what I mean?
[28:47.07]In Meat Boy, Meat Boy taught me a lot.
[28:50.29]Check.
[28:50.57]See?
[28:51.03]Check it.
[28:51.63]Just go.
[28:53.21]If you can make the jump, make the jump.
[28:55.67]Don't sit around.
[28:56.25]Wait.
[28:56.43]And speaking of jumps, look at that over there.
[28:58.52]We can go this way.
[29:02.90]Oh, dear.
[29:06.62]How do you open that shit, though?
[29:10.66]Where's my keys?
[29:11.54]I don't have any keys.
[29:16.33]And you know it's like sometimes you accidentally hold R2 because you're a fucking idiot and you like fat finger the whole controller At least I know what that is Do you guys ever do that?
[29:34.38]I don't have lockpicking yet
[29:41.68]If I hold down squared, will I run faster like in Meat Boy?
[29:45.36]Was that a Meat Boy fallacy?
[29:46.58]I think I'm describing a Meat Boy fallacy.
[29:48.38]If you don't know, a Meat Boy fallacy is when something is what you thought was in Meat Boy, but it's not in Meat Boy.
[29:58.37]It's in a completely different game.
[30:01.85]You're going to hear at least a dozen Meat Boy fallacies this playthrough.
[30:24.99]Come on, you fucking idiot.
[30:27.89]Really?
[30:28.57]Get over here.
[30:32.90]I obviously have to grab the edge here.
[30:39.42]What was over there?
[30:40.14]I thought I had the level beat, so I looked over at fucking chat.
[30:54.52]Do I like guns and roses?
[31:01.71]I don't know.
[31:04.69]The correct answer is no.
[31:07.01]But the right answer is... The actual answer is probably yes.
[31:11.56]Are they the ones that did all the drugs?
[31:16.34]Are they the rock stars that did all the drugs?
[31:20.04]Which rock stars were those?
[31:21.47]I know there's like a couple.
[31:23.98]I need this.
[31:24.44]And I'll just, like, kite them over.
[31:32.03]I'm gonna give myself an aneurysm playing this game.
[31:39.79]I can already guarantee that.
[31:45.12]Alright, a finite amount, like... Sometimes you just gotta give the fuck up on these things, right?
[31:51.08]And there was a thing up there that I hit.
[32:00.36]Alright, good.
[32:04.62]Come on, you fucking frog skulls.
[32:06.40]Get me up there.
[32:13.37]I know it's a meatball fallacy, but I'm holding down square.
[32:16.21]I mean, I have to.
[32:16.83]Otherwise, how am I ever going to beat this?
[32:33.04]Got it.
[32:34.36]Left?
[32:34.88]I can't go left.
[32:35.58]Come on, what happened to, like, the explore everything?
[32:37.56]What?
[32:38.14]That's not cool.
[32:41.65]Got it.
[32:44.91]Come on!
[32:45.95]What was the odd?
[32:49.69]Shit.
[32:55.27]I wish I could turn the audio down on my end.
[33:04.77]Almost there.
[33:06.97]Just be patient.
[33:09.51]I gotta wait for an opening like that.
[33:10.65]I'm gonna jump into spikes if I don't.
[33:14.09]Oh, god damn it, you stupid fucking idiot.
[33:16.79]Like, be patient.
[33:18.39]And the first thing you do is you just jump right into them.
[33:22.81]Now we gotta do it again.
[33:24.65]Hold square.
[33:25.53]Just, I have to.
[33:26.41]Oi!
[33:26.83]Oi!
[33:30.60]Have patience.
[33:31.80]Easy.
[33:33.89]Oh.
[33:35.41]My lips are just pursed up like an angry father.
[33:39.90]That was disappointed that you got like fucking F. I can hear it.
[33:48.98]I can very... I have to turn this down.
[33:57.61]For me.
[34:03.09]The fucking wait, what?
[34:05.51]That sub sound was going to the music and it was freaking me the fuck out.
[34:16.58]Wait, what?
[34:19.24]Wait, what?
[34:24.90]I'm going on the next one.
[34:28.68]Got it.
[34:31.24]Wait, what?
[34:35.29]Can I jump on those guys?
[34:37.51]No, I can't touch those.
[34:38.79]Can't touch them.
[34:41.15]Don't know why I even tried.
[34:42.63]How do I... Now I gotta wait till he gets over here.
[34:57.99]Come on, what?
[35:02.47]What did I do wrong there?
[35:04.75]I must have waited too long.
[35:06.41]Why do I have to jump off one of their heads?
[35:12.63]No, I don't.
[35:15.18]Well, let's go pick this up.
[35:18.10]Oh, shit.
[35:18.96]Okay, I'm good.
[35:21.00]No, I'm not good.
[35:23.08]Not good!
[35:24.36]Oh, I didn't even see it.
[35:25.50]I didn't even see it.
[35:26.28]What is...
[35:29.61]Didn't even see that thing closing in on me.
[35:33.17]Now I'm, now I'm angry.
[35:34.11]Now I'm just, it's, the whole thing's thrown in the trash.
[35:36.35]God damn it.
[35:45.91]I'm gonna have to save.
[35:46.57]I don't, I don't, I don't want to give that one another chance.
[35:50.51]We came and we lost.
[36:01.41]It's the same game, Ed.
[36:05.07]Like, what's going on here, Ed?
[36:14.48]How am I holding this?
[36:19.20]Shit!
[36:29.43]Sacred.
[36:31.99]Come on, Ed.
[36:35.84]Nothing can hurt me down here, right?
[36:44.82]Ed, what's the point of doing all that if I'm just gonna go all the fucking way down and not get the stupid secret?
[36:50.29]What the fuck, Ed?
[36:52.53]Ugh.
[37:04.46]Ayayay.
[37:10.16]And I don't even know how the fuck I got down there in the first place.
[37:17.01]I don't remember.
[37:17.57]I don't remember how I got down here.
[37:21.49]I did the whole thing.
[37:39.05]Does that still count?
[37:41.07]I still got it, right?
[37:47.50]Why is he not grabbing it?
[37:50.14]I don't fucking understand.
[37:51.62]How come sometimes he gets it and sometimes he doesn't?
[37:55.78]Oh, god damn it.
[37:59.19]What the fuck, Ed?
[38:10.67]I just stood up in my seat because I didn't wait long enough Okay, this this level is so so in credibly in fucking credibly simple
[38:39.60]You finicky motherfucking game.
[38:52.93]That's so easy, and I fucking just couldn't do it.
[38:57.79]R2 is what?
[39:00.93]Hold X. What?
[39:02.29]I don't get it.
[39:03.08]Alright, you can drop.
[39:05.64]Holding X is a... Oh, you... Okay, you swim.
[39:12.64]No, it's just like Super Mario.
[39:14.20]It really is.
[39:17.36]It actually is like Super Mario, guys.
[39:22.92]I know you don't want me to make that reference, but I kind of have to.
[39:37.37]Where is he?
[39:37.79]Down there?
[39:40.15]Make a beeline for him.
[39:40.97]Got him.
[39:44.11]How many of these do I actually need?
[39:45.55]Oh, I'm dead.
[39:52.82]Oh, come on.
[40:02.46]I already hate this place.
[40:04.60]I keep doing the same thing.
[40:07.10]Oh, God.
[40:08.20]Oh.
[40:16.28]Why?
[40:26.21]Got it.
[40:26.49]Alright, don't fuck it up.
[40:32.79]Get good, kid.
[40:36.43]I'm trying to get good.
[40:39.31]I'm trying to get really hard.
[40:40.57]Can I...
[40:49.84]Now what?
[40:50.38]Just over and across?
[40:51.78]I guess.
[40:54.08]There's a guy over there.
[40:56.28]He's one of those guys.
[41:04.56]This is very loud.
[41:06.08]Alright, I obviously have to get off one and the other.
[41:17.94]Okay.
[41:19.61]I gotta time this so it's now.
[41:21.45]No, it's not now.
[41:22.49]It wasn't then.
[41:23.21]It was before.
[41:23.79]It was way before.
[41:30.51]And right when he touches.
[41:32.73]And there we go.
[41:38.17]That water is polluted.
[41:40.65]At first it tickles a bit and then it's like a nice chemical peel.
[41:43.98]I can't remember what happens after that.
[41:46.76]Hmm.
[41:50.67]Thank you, MostlyLost, SamTeddy, and UglySuperHero for the bits.
[41:55.71]You may die over and over again in this game, but you will never die in our hearts.
[41:58.40]Keep being you.
[41:59.28]Well, thank you, UglySuperHero.
[42:02.32]Life is hard when you're extraordinarily handsome, isn't it, Jeremy?
[42:09.32]It is, SamTeddy.
[42:10.08]I appreciate that, by the way.
[42:15.27]Uh, and most of the loss.
[42:15.91]Why did you get a new interface?
[42:16.99]Your audio seemed fine before.
[42:18.43]Just curious.
[42:19.67]Because I wanted to add... Um... Like... A filter on me.
[42:26.43]Like, a filter on my voice.
[42:27.53]Like, high dynamic.
[42:28.89]Like, range.
[42:29.65]Like, equalization.
[42:31.03]That kind of stuff.
[42:31.61]I can't touch this for very long.
[42:32.85]So, what does he mean by that?
[42:36.12]Oh, okay.
[42:36.42]You die, like, instantly.
[42:37.50]I get it.
[42:42.30]Hmm...
[42:46.49]Can I make this move?
[42:50.07]Okay, I think I can still get it.
[43:04.10]Oh, that's gonna be hard to get.
[43:08.76]God, fuck you!
[43:09.92]I had it.
[43:10.56]I actually had that.
[43:13.96]You have to be perfect.
[43:16.70]That wasn't perfect.
[43:23.31]Stop holding on, you fucking idiot.
[43:41.37]Can I go down?
[43:49.83]No, I just pull it into the bottom of the ocean.
[43:54.81]Yeah, I know, you hold R2.
[43:55.91]What is it doing over here?
[44:01.60]I thought I was trying to block.
[44:02.46]I don't know.
[44:03.32]I don't know what I was doing, guys.
[44:04.84]This is a hard game.
[44:13.99]You guys have noticed... Let me ask you this.
[44:15.73]Let me ask something.
[44:17.44]I'm gonna die first.
[44:18.96]You guys have noticed the hard games that I actually beat on stream?
[44:23.24]And the other ones, I may as well not even be playing them.
[44:27.60]Have you guys noticed that?
[44:28.82]I have.
[44:38.37]Good lord.
[44:45.99]This one, though, I don't like that one.
[44:48.05]I don't like this one, so we're not going to get that.
[44:49.45]We're just going to try to beat it, because this is this, this is this.
[44:56.72]You know, you hold X and it doesn't do anything.
[45:07.54]We can sit right here and get it.
[45:09.86]At least I hope we can.
[45:12.04]Say your prayers.
[45:17.33]Yeah, right.
[45:18.13]I mean, maybe in another lifetime.
[45:26.79]Okay, found it.
[45:27.88]Found this one, whatever this is.
[45:31.24]God.
[45:35.00]Aye, aye, aye.
[45:35.94]This is going to be difficult.
[45:36.98]I've got to jump on this guy and then this one.
[45:43.26]Oh, man.
[45:44.55]God.
[45:46.41]It's just too many of them.
[45:50.03]And somebody's, like, playing pool in the background.
[45:52.17]It's freaking me out.
[45:59.87]Jesus Christ.
[46:12.33]I love how, like... What's the hit detection on these stupid motherfuckers?
[46:15.18]Like, really?
[46:16.79]Why can't I headbutt these idiots?
[46:21.51]That's what you got to do.
[46:22.07]You just got to go.
[46:25.94]Is this a meatball game?
[46:27.18]I would have had it if I just jumped.
[46:34.70]That's what you got to do.
[46:42.96]Fuck away from me.
[46:44.66]I win.
[46:45.58]Okay, so wait.
[46:46.10]Was there another way to go?
[46:47.10]I don't think there's another way to go.
[46:55.05]Wait, did I miss one over here too?
[46:57.27]Or am I out of my mind?
[47:02.95]No, that's my reflection.
[47:04.29]Okay.
[47:07.98]Just out of reach to get this one.
[47:11.18]Uh-huh.
[47:18.58]Whatever.
[47:21.16]What's this?
[47:24.05]No.
[47:24.33]It's a weird little crevice, though, you have to admit.
[47:32.53]It's a very strange crevice.
[47:34.72]I didn't even see that fucking guy, so, you know, whatever.
[47:43.95]Same deal.
[47:49.19]No more of those guys, right?
[47:51.15]Whoa!
[47:59.89]Ah, come on.
[48:00.53]I beat... This is like the third Meat Boy World and I beat the shit out of that.
[48:15.08]It's a little different, though.
[48:19.73]Ooh, okay.
[48:20.41]Hold on, I got this.
[48:25.38]My muscle, my fucking muscle memory going the other way ain't gonna work as much as I would like it to.
[48:45.46]God damn it.
[48:51.75]That's what you do!
[49:00.77]Snoring?
[49:01.47]Come on, that was a little difficult.
[49:03.37]Come on, I give you a fucking Al Pacino.
[49:12.78]You're still bad.
[49:13.88]Oh, sorry!
[49:18.06]I did that on my second try, idiot.
[49:23.40]Come on.
[49:38.38]Come on.
[49:46.07]Oh, fuck.
[49:46.55]I gotta go back.
[49:52.83]Oh, shit.
[49:58.49]Ah, I'm going.
[50:00.28]I want to get to the other guy.
[50:05.40]Oh.
[50:07.18]I can't stand that.
[50:09.52]Interesting.
[50:13.56]Can I... Alright.
[50:16.40]You can jump on his head, but that doesn't do anything.
[50:38.56]I want a key.
[50:42.32]What's the story of this?
[50:43.40]I'm actually not sure.
[50:46.33]You're like a YouTuber.
[50:51.25]I'm like a Twitch streamer and I want my new game or something.
[50:54.05]I want my game back.
[50:57.35]Looks like I can do one or two jumps on this guy.
[50:59.51]I don't know.
[51:01.23]Well, I guess that was not as smooth as I thought it was gonna be.
[51:19.40]What does any of this mean?
[51:23.16]I'm just a Twitch streamer that wants my audio interface to work.
[51:32.60]Well.
[51:35.79]Well.
[51:48.32]Hmm.
[51:50.78]I think I have to get it on the first pass, I think.
[51:59.33]Shit.
[51:59.65]Yeah, I gotta get it right here.
[52:02.07]Alright, there it is.
[52:02.91]There we go!
[52:14.20]Go get the tumor, go back the way you came.
[52:16.16]What are you talking about?
[52:19.80]Just get the tumor and go backwards?
[52:22.66]Don't I wanna... Why would I wanna do that?
[52:25.42]Is there a certain reason why I should be doing that?
[52:37.28]You can save the tumor by going back.
[52:38.98]Oh, okay.
[52:45.38]How do I do this one?
[52:46.14]I think I have to go all the way up.
[52:50.29]This is going to be one of those ones you have to go all the way around for.
[52:53.25]And shit, there's a cloud here too.
[52:54.89]I'll just jump off the cliff.
[53:04.42]Shit.
[53:16.68]Is it worth going for for one?
[53:18.88]Well, not if you do it like that.
[53:25.50]I'm gonna get him on the way up.
[53:30.32]Oh!
[53:35.68]It's the music!
[53:36.28]That sound that's killing me.
[53:37.68]It scares the shit out of me.
[53:40.15]Nope.
[53:40.67]I can still get it.
[53:50.51]Nope.
[53:52.44]Alright, we're skipping this one too.
[53:55.02]One more try and that's it.
[54:02.18]He moves a little to the left.
[54:03.97]I can't jump over that though.
[54:06.41]He's going to get me killed.
[54:07.17]There we go.
[54:12.67]Alright.
[54:14.53]I can't fuck this up.
[54:25.06]Come over here.
[54:31.87]Can I go up?
[54:32.91]Like, actually, all the way up.
[54:36.21]No.
[54:38.49]Maybe I can.
[54:39.71]I might be able to.
[54:40.37]Fuck.
[54:45.34]Not worth it.
[54:45.88]Just finish it.
[54:47.40]I'll go back and take a look.
[54:49.22]Can I make this jump?
[54:54.05]And there is something up there.
[54:55.13]Okay.
[54:55.89]How do I... How?
[55:02.75]The next level, maybe?
[55:04.79]I don't... I don't know.
[55:13.08]I didn't see any way to discernibly get up there.
[55:16.92]Did any of you?
[55:21.28]Hey, Germer, I'm taking a literature class when school starts back up, including to the two novels assigned to us, we must choose... What does that say?
[55:30.41]We must choose one more by ourselves.
[55:32.83]Do you mind if I use your novel?
[55:45.62]Yeah, he got it.
[55:47.24]He got me.
[55:48.82]He did get me.
[55:50.06]That was fucking good.
[55:52.28]That was really good.
[55:55.35]That was like a, hey man, he recommended like, oh yeah, the Car of the Wild.
[56:02.83]Let's see.
[56:03.95]One, two.
[56:05.89]One, two.
[56:08.15]Sometimes you gotta just count.
[56:09.29]Sometimes you gotta just count with your hands.
[56:13.07]one two one two one two sometimes you gotta count and I had it I had it I was counting ready one two and there comes one two just use your finger you have ten of them use them
[56:42.74]How do I get over here?
[56:46.02]What?
[56:46.44]Uh... What?
[56:49.93]I don't understand.
[57:01.33]One, two.
[57:07.39]One, two.
[57:12.95]God damn it.
[57:15.55]God, god, god damn it.
[57:16.91]I hit, like, R2.
[57:17.46]One, two.
[57:17.94]Get this fucking cord off me before I scream in my own mouth.
[57:29.28]That's what I was trying to do, and, like, I... Honestly, God, I didn't take a shower today either.
[57:42.54]That's so annoying.
[57:43.93]That's so fucking irritating to me.
[57:45.99]When you just miss it by like the quarter of a pixel that you can miss it by.
[57:49.57]That makes me want to fucking bury my head into the sand.
[58:01.63]Oh shit.
[58:07.36]They're all on drugs, you can tell.
[58:15.26]Damn it.
[58:15.58]This is going to be tricky.
[58:28.51]And it didn't fucking.
[58:32.66]Oh, God damn it.
[58:44.52]God, that sucked.
[58:51.20]Didn't even make it.
[58:55.40]There's no room for error there, too.
[58:57.01]If you mess it up, you have to do the whole thing over.
[58:58.95]That sucks such an asshole.
[59:05.99]Get off.
[59:06.27]What are you doing?
[59:06.85]Ay-yi-yi.
[59:20.91]Like, if I can help it, I need to die in the smoke and not fall down.
[59:26.99]Let me just keep going.
[59:28.03]I have to just keep going left.
[59:28.99]Here we go.
[59:38.41]No.
[59:39.51]I didn't get it.
[59:41.16]That's close.
[59:41.64]I gotta just... That's close.
[59:57.81]Oh, God.
[59:59.55]Damn it, Ed.
[60:00.75]Why?
[60:02.25]Why God?
[60:03.63]Why God in hell?
[60:05.78]There is no God.
[60:06.66]Why am I seeing... Wait, where am I?
[60:15.86]There is no God.
[60:23.11]That's... It's a little finicky for me.
[60:34.03]I love the guy that just said, whoa, dude.
[60:43.56]Wait, I can't go to the left?
[60:47.26]There's nothing to the left?
[60:48.72]I gotta go back to the right.
[60:54.31]Is that what you're telling me?
[60:57.21]There's nothing to the left?
[60:58.25]Why?
[60:59.67]And I'm freaking out about it now.
[61:13.70]Get over there, Ren!
[61:17.70]There is no God.
[61:20.38]I was making a fucking reference to the... What was that thing?
[61:23.91]Was that movie?
[61:27.35]I got it.
[61:27.75]I did it.
[61:28.21]Everybody, don't worry.
[61:28.93]I did it.
[61:29.37]Everybody calm down.
[61:31.83]I've seen that movie.
[61:34.52]How do I get up here?
[61:47.79]I guess we're seeing that in the movie.
[61:49.94]Just drop, just drop down.
[61:53.16]Why am I dropping down for?
[61:54.14]Okay.
[62:18.11]Uh, where's that guy?
[62:18.87]Isn't there like a weird guy here?
[62:32.60]He was like in the desert, right?
[62:33.72]I don't remember where he is.
[62:40.11]Any of you guys remember where he is?
[62:51.42]Oh, come on.
[62:55.52]Where's the skip?
[62:56.28]Where's this fucking throw a frisbee part of this game?
[63:11.83]No, wait, wait, wait.
[63:12.53]It was in there, wasn't it?
[63:17.57]Isn't it like down here?
[63:23.34]Well, I'm locked in here now.
[63:37.81]No, I tried to get that one before.
[63:47.77]Gotta ti- I can actually, I probably can get this one if I time it right.
[63:53.79]Got it.
[63:57.55]There he is.
[63:58.37]Alright, what does he want me to do?
[63:59.35]I gotta bring him 50... 50 something.
[64:01.30]Mmm, Eureka of Sadness.
[64:04.54]Please poke your head into the future.
[64:10.46]Okay.
[64:13.82]The future.
[64:18.29]Okay.
[64:23.15]Oh boy, here we go.
[64:23.85]I can't touch any... I can't touch any of these, like, fucking feeble... What are those?
[64:30.19]What are those?
[64:30.57]The weebles?
[64:35.17]I see you right there.
[64:40.39]Oh, God.
[64:42.65]Jelly beans.
[64:49.98]Come on.
[64:59.93]Did I miss it?
[65:00.73]I think I missed it.
[65:02.27]Did I miss what I was supposed to do?
[65:03.39]I missed it.
[65:05.05]Something else was falling, right?
[65:07.19]What was falling?
[65:08.11]What happened?
[65:08.51]I don't understand.
[65:14.55]Oh, there he is.
[65:24.23]Oh, that's so stressful.
[65:40.82]Shit, you shit, you shithead, you shithead!
[65:52.83]You shithead.
[65:54.19]Whoa!
[66:08.90]Oh, god darn.
[66:10.88]Okay, that's... That's not possible now.
[66:14.98]I have to run very fast.
[66:29.74]Dammit.
[66:35.49]I just- I jumped in the air.
[66:36.55]Where the hell was I going?
[66:37.49]I turned into like a fucking hot air balloon.
[66:45.56]Fucked it up.
[66:49.02]Still got it.
[66:49.82]Card acquired.
[66:50.50]Play it on your home console.
[66:53.08]Should I jump over or jump down?
[66:56.33]Like go in the hole or go down into the muck?
[67:10.30]Don't risk it?
[67:12.61]Jump into the arrow?
[67:13.93]Or should I jump into the hole?
[67:18.15]Holy moly!
[67:22.26]I'll play it safe.
[67:24.34]Where's my cartridge?
[67:30.10]Let's play it.
[67:33.84]Denial.
[67:35.96]The bare minimum beat the game.
[67:46.59]What?
[67:46.77]It's another game?
[67:47.53]Okay.
[67:50.17]Okay.
[67:54.51]Oh.
[67:55.98]Oh.
[67:57.44]Oh.
[67:59.60]I get it.
[68:07.04]One, two... Uh... I... Ooh, you gotta do the whole thing in one life!
[68:21.86]So this is gonna be a lot of trial and error.
[68:25.20]Trying to figure out exactly what I need to do here.
[68:32.91]One, two.
[68:37.47]Oh, that's it.
[68:38.07]I thought that thing was gonna hurt me.
[68:39.97]I thought that was like a fucking... I thought that was like a flame.
[68:44.27]I really thought that thing was gonna hurt me.
[68:47.09]It's a key.
[68:50.77]Okay.
[68:54.70]One, two.
[69:03.33]One, three.
[69:06.61]Okay, so it comes over here.
[69:09.15]That's gonna kill me.
[69:12.34]Huh.
[69:14.26]Hold on now.
[69:15.90]Will it kill me?
[69:16.68]It's gonna hit me right in the head, right?
[69:18.06]What if I crouch?
[69:25.68]Damn it.
[69:27.90]I gotta hang off that thing.
[69:39.10]Rip, run.
[69:41.46]Hold on.
[69:42.50]Okay, so the same rules apply in this game.
[69:44.62]Well, it's a different game.
[69:47.34]You guys couldn't have expected me to think that.
[69:48.78]We're in a different game.
[69:49.48]Come on.
[69:53.05]We're in a different video game.
[69:55.61]And I fucking tried!
[69:56.97]This guy is a vegan?
[70:06.29]Dude, I fucking, I ate like a pound of ground beef two hours ago.
[70:10.95]And it hurt.
[70:13.14]Oh, stop making your shitty jokes.
[70:15.70]And get to the end of this, please.
[70:19.68]No, I'm not a fucking vegan.
[70:22.53]What would possibly give that away?
[70:24.21]That I was a vegan?
[70:29.28]Excuses, you vegan.
[70:33.81]Fucking vegan.
[70:34.73]What are we talking about here?
[70:46.94]I never said I don't like vegans.
[70:48.32]What is going on in this chat right now?
[70:51.21]I never said any of these things.
[70:52.45]You guys are putting these words in my mouth for no reason.
[71:03.90]That's exactly how a vegan would laugh.
[71:09.04]God, I forgot.
[71:10.28]I forgot.
[71:11.66]You're not allowed to say the word vegan on the internet.
[71:17.30]That's what you gotta do.
[71:20.26]If you say the word vegan on the internet, it's like calling Voldemort.
[71:24.24]Or Beetlejuice.
[71:26.19]You say vegan once, be careful.
[71:27.85]You say vegan twice, now you're in trouble.
[71:29.63]You say vegan three times, fucking vegan juice comes out.
[71:35.69]It causes a problem.
[71:39.67]You guys are like a Bloody Mary.
[71:42.95]You know what Bloody Mary is?
[71:43.79]You know when you say Bloody Mary three times in the mirror?
[71:46.87]Shit.
[71:47.51]Fuck Bloody Mary.
[71:48.60]She's not even real.
[71:49.26]Why am I saying that?
[71:49.96]That's not even a fucking real person.
[71:51.84]That was a real person, actually.
[71:53.02]Who was that?
[71:59.67]You say fucking vegan in the mirror three times, you become a vegan.
[72:07.55]He's scared to say it three times.
[72:09.26]I'm not saying it three times.
[72:13.18]If I say vegan juice, I've already said it too many times.
[72:18.80]I can't say it one more time.
[72:21.84]I need to concentrate.
[72:23.00]Time to concentrate.
[72:23.68]No more of this stupid joke.
[72:25.35]For real.
[72:27.69]I don't think I'm doing that next part right, by the way.
[72:46.54]I gotta get a better look at this.
[72:52.15]Okay, I gotta get on top?
[72:53.51]I don't even know.
[72:55.87]Let's go for it.
[73:04.26]No.
[73:05.28]Fuck this fucking vegan game.
[73:07.48]Why'd I... Why'd I say it again?
[73:13.22]Oh, goddammit, man.
[73:14.58]What does he want?
[73:15.42]Oh.
[73:17.93]300.
[73:17.97]He said it.
[73:24.59]Alright, so what's left here?
[73:26.49]The overflow.
[73:31.33]I'm not going to let it beat me.
[74:02.14]Save Bloody Mary three times on stream.
[74:04.22]No.
[74:06.42]Shut up.
[74:07.30]No.
[74:07.82]Stop it.
[74:14.87]It's gotten to... I've only been playing for like an hour and like change.
[74:18.13]And it's already at that point where like the whole game is blending together.
[74:21.82]You know what I mean?
[74:22.60]Like all the colors blend together and like you can't even make the easiest jumps.
[74:26.14]It's starting to happen.
[74:50.62]Get me out.
[74:51.72]That's gonna take... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[74:53.62]Not the whole game.
[74:56.58]Not the whole game, dude.
[74:58.06]Like, just... I didn't mean the whole fucking game.
[75:16.59]I got that one.
[75:22.42]Vegan down.
[75:26.26]Do you get, like, new powers or something, or... This is eventually, or do you just have the same moves the whole time?
[75:36.92]Let me explore, make sure I don't miss anything.
[75:47.96]Might as well look around.
[75:49.64]Look at that.
[75:51.13]If you look around hard enough, you're gonna find it.
[75:53.43]You're gonna find it.
[75:55.13]Can I make this?
[76:04.65]Shit.
[76:05.09]I should've looked around a little more.
[76:06.19]That was dumb.
[76:06.67]Can't get up anywhere.
[76:17.25]Hmm.
[76:19.43]Well.
[76:24.85]I can't make this jump.
[76:32.30]No, I can't make this jump.
[76:34.48]It's not going to happen.
[76:41.52]Holy shit.
[76:42.40]I just barely made that.
[76:59.32]Damn, okay.
[77:03.70]Mega tumor, plus five.
[77:08.26]Ah, shit.
[77:09.68]I didn't know I could jump over that.
[77:11.16]Well, I gotta do this again.
[77:12.10]Alright, alright.
[77:21.63]I'm gonna say like something else.
[77:23.83]I'm gonna say something else like fucking weird and like insane.
[77:27.98]I gotta get us off this vegan thing, right?
[77:29.92]I have to get us off the fucking vegan thing.
[77:33.28]I wear a diaper.
[77:34.78]I wear a diaper and I piss and I shit in it every day.
[77:36.84]I'm wearing one right now.
[77:48.76]That was such blind fucking luck if I've ever seen it.
[78:01.63]Tell us something we don't know.
[78:05.16]That was a fucking good jump.
[78:06.74]Give me credit for that, guys.
[78:08.00]Come on.
[78:09.96]Oh, cool guy.
[78:10.68]I wish I could roll down there in the mire with you.
[78:15.22]But I'm just too cute and innocent to descend.
[78:17.38]So I'm just hanging up here until I die, I guess.
[78:21.36]Oh, cool guy.
[78:22.02]Okay, well.
[78:24.17]Bye, cool guy.
[78:31.96]That's it?
[78:32.50]There's got to be something else here, right?
[78:34.99]There's no way.
[78:41.91]I'm surprised.
[78:47.80]He doesn't do anything else?
[78:55.64]I don't want to go back down here.
[78:59.20]What was that fucking diaper shit?
[79:02.36]It was a desperate plea to get everybody off the vegan joke.
[79:09.27]Uh... Whatever.
[79:14.85]I guess I'm just gonna go down.
[79:17.27]Although I'm upset and surprised that there's nothing up there.
[79:19.67]I mean, there is something up there, but I can't do anything about it.
[79:25.07]Little hole.
[79:25.73]What little hole?
[79:28.84]I don't see a little hole.
[79:42.30]Whatever.
[79:42.60]Just gonna jump down.
[79:43.58]Can I go here?
[79:50.28]No.
[79:50.50]I mean, there's this.
[79:57.28]But, I mean, that's...
[80:03.39]What, down here?
[80:04.29]No.
[80:05.93]Down to the left?
[80:12.04]No.
[80:13.36]Just keep going.
[80:14.06]Can I sneak down here?
[80:27.01]This is just weird enough to be real, right?
[80:31.19]Let's close.
[80:34.31]Eat meat on stream or you're a vegan.
[80:40.21]I like ate like a chicken enchilada on stream.
[80:44.69]Like a month or two ago or something.
[80:47.33]I did.
[80:53.64]Damn it.
[81:01.90]I'm trying to get it.
[81:06.99]Got it.
[81:07.23]Okay.
[81:09.95]Really?
[81:10.29]There's nothing here?
[81:12.81]I can't believe it.
[81:15.09]Wow.
[81:17.81]That's very surprising.
[81:18.96]I really thought that was going to be something there.
[81:23.44]That was a subway sub?
[81:25.46]Subway subs are like soy.
[81:26.76]Oh yeah, it is soy chicken, isn't it?
[81:32.14]What the fuck was that?
[81:35.28]I didn't even see that last time.
[81:36.54]There's, like, one of these vegans under here.
[81:38.58]What?
[81:39.00]Stop it.
[81:55.22]What am I doing?
[81:56.10]Like, I'm trying to stop it, and I just fucking made it way worse.
[81:59.88]Like... Seriously, man.
[82:03.48]Come on.
[82:05.75]Like, are you even trying?
[82:06.81]I just broke that thing.
[82:12.82]Ugh, I should have counted.
[82:28.17]Alright, when he goes in the water, it's one.
[82:30.05]No, it's when he jumps.
[82:31.06]After he jumps.
[82:31.76]One.
[82:32.70]Two.
[82:33.68]Three.
[82:35.80]One.
[82:36.76]Two.
[82:37.82]One.
[82:38.76]Two.
[82:39.86]One.
[82:40.56]Fucking count, guys.
[82:41.50]I'm telling you.
[82:42.06]It's gonna make your life way easier.
[82:52.46]So what's the point?
[82:54.76]Of any of this?
[83:00.29]I don't get it.
[83:00.67]It didn't do anything.
[83:10.07]One.
[83:10.94]Two.
[83:12.04]One.
[83:14.02]What about on the right there?
[83:15.12]I see a little crumbly.
[83:16.92]Yeah, there's a little crumbly on the right there.
[83:21.80]I do see a little crumbly.
[83:22.74]Let me pick up the vegan and then we'll keep going.
[83:27.01]One.
[83:27.93]Two.
[83:29.13]One.
[83:30.05]Two.
[83:31.13]One.
[83:32.05]Two.
[83:33.17]One.
[83:34.11]One.
[83:35.09]Two.
[83:36.21]One.
[83:38.00]Uh, it didn't work.
[83:40.56]There's nothing there, apparently.
[83:41.58]I don't know.
[83:48.02]I guess there's nothing there.
[83:48.80]I can't do anything with that.
[83:53.27]One.
[83:54.22]Two.
[83:55.40]One.
[83:57.16]Two.
[83:58.22]One.
[83:59.34]Nope.
[84:01.20]That's unfortunate, but it's okay.
[84:05.60]Alright.
[84:10.15]Nothing over here.
[84:10.71]I'm just seeing if there's any secret walls.
[84:14.73]I'm just trying to do my due diligence, guys.
[84:16.73]That's all I'm doing.
[84:20.00]The water's polluted.
[84:20.94]I know it is.
[84:27.96]And that too, I would have really thought that was going to be, like, we got in there fast enough that you could, you know... Come on, Ed.
[84:35.41]Give us something to work with here, you know what I mean?
[84:46.16]Just checking.
[84:52.90]Just checking.
[84:59.54]Alright, I'm just gonna go.
[85:02.06]Can't do anything else here.
[85:06.62]Play more shit.
[85:07.86]Oh, by the way, this is really important.
[85:10.82]If you guys saw my Twitter, I have a SEGA CD now.
[85:15.40]That's suspicious, that little tube right there.
[85:17.18]I have a SEGA CD, I bought it, I have it, I own it.
[85:23.35]And I have a bunch of games for it.
[85:24.61]There's a lot of crazy shit on the SEGA CD.
[85:33.24]That's... I don't know if I can get down there.
[85:34.66]Fucking just go.
[85:43.12]I got like... I have Night Trap.
[85:45.43]I have a couple of really old FMV games that look just stupid and absolutely fucking hilarious to play.
[85:54.59]We'll have to check them out.
[86:04.10]I guess not.
[86:04.52]If you don't know what Night Trap is... Really?
[86:11.01]Yeah, we're gonna have a straight-up, like, SEGA CD week.
[86:29.18]Should be a lot of fun.
[86:32.52]And if it ain't, well, I'm sorry.
[86:34.08]I tried.
[86:34.81]That's what I do.
[86:38.97]God damn, man.
[86:53.34]You missed a tumor.
[86:56.06]I've missed quite a few, actually.
[87:09.55]So can that.
[87:10.17]Can I keep going though?
[87:21.32]Damn it.
[87:24.14]I can't.
[87:27.27]I thought I could go down.
[87:28.21]That sucks.
[87:44.60]Let's go back.
[87:48.88]Streamer complains about constant technical difficulties.
[87:51.30]Picks up a SEGA CD.
[87:54.35]But the thing about the SEGA CD is... The SEGA CD was not the extreme amount of money that this other thing was.
[88:16.34]Trying to look at this one.
[88:20.27]You have promised Just Cause 3?
[88:21.47]Well, you should have asked some of your friends to play.
[88:24.25]Because nobody's playing it.
[88:41.80]Do research into things you want to buy.
[88:43.26]If somebody gives you a red flag like this is non-refundable, don't buy it.
[88:46.57]Well, it's literally one of the best products you could like ever purchase for a USB audio interface.
[88:52.69]It's like the best one they make.
[88:54.87]So, I mean, I just figured that like literally like one of the best products that they make is gonna work.
[89:04.83]I wasn't in the back alleyway with some fucking fat guy in a tank top that was like, hey, will you buy this, by the way?
[89:10.93]That's non-refundable.
[89:13.41]Get out of here.
[89:16.37]Maybe it's a sign to switch from OBS.
[89:19.83]I could go off on a fucking long rant about this shit.
[89:26.29]It's an OBS thing.
[89:28.37]It cannot be seen in OBS.
[89:30.13]It won't work in OBS.
[89:31.13]OBS doesn't allow this type of audio interface.
[89:35.46]And there was no way I could have known that.
[89:39.31]You want me to switch from OBS?
[89:41.31]Sure, I'll switch from OBS.
[89:42.91]Let me switch over... Let's talk some shit, okay?
[89:46.63]Like, everyone hang out for a second.
[89:47.69]Let's talk some shit.
[89:51.21]There's XSplit.
[89:52.64]XSplit is, like, one of the only ones.
[89:55.42]It's OBS, XSplit, or, like, Wirecast, okay?
[89:58.38]So, XSplit is not only to pay for it.
[90:02.16]I believe it's $200 for XSplit.
[90:07.31]Uh, they got fucking hacked and leaked out like fucking thousands and thousands and thousands of people's personal information.
[90:15.13]I was one of those people.
[90:16.69]So, like, kind of fucking annoying.
[90:19.24]I used to have XSplit, like, years ago.
[90:22.22]So, uh, no, I don't want to use XSplit.
[90:24.12]I don't want to give, like, $200 to XSplit after they, like, fucking threw my personal information into a garbage can.
[90:28.94]You know what I mean?
[90:36.00]OBS is just like the best one it just is It just is like it OBS studio is good.
[90:43.24]It's very good.
[90:47.20]I Want a free joke Ashley Madison, no, we're not talking about Ashley Madison.
[90:53.87]We're talking about exploit And sure I'm sure exploit is a cool cool program I
[91:05.68]But I don't know.
[91:07.16]I never really... I've tried to use it again.
[91:11.18]Nothing up there.
[91:15.72]OBS has a lot more features that are worth using.
[91:19.36]I always complain about OBS.
[91:20.48]Yeah, but it's like... The streaming software is so... Like, nobody cares.
[91:29.75]No one's gonna make one.
[91:33.69]You can stream from your Xbox, you know what I mean?
[91:38.17]You can stream from the PS4.
[91:40.04]It's gonna look lovely.
[91:44.96]There are other streaming services, but there's no money in making a streaming service.
[91:53.53]Unless one of you guys makes one and figures it out.
[92:05.07]Is XSplit used in the professional world?
[92:06.39]How is it in business with OBS?
[92:10.36]I don't... The thing that I don't like about XSplit, and the problem that I always had with XSplit was... You, um... Hold on.
[92:19.12]I want to see what the hell I'm doing over here.
[92:20.38]Can I go this way?
[92:23.91]XSplit doesn't have... You can't, like... I don't... This might be ignorance, but I couldn't find it anywhere.
[92:31.43]OBS Studio lets you...
[92:34.55]actually individually change audio levels on the fly I don't think you can do that in xplit at least I'm not from my understanding every individual thing that I have open my microphone uh my desktop audio my like transitions like I can I can individually drag them around I don't think you can do that in xplit I don't think so at least
[93:02.66]But, like, the point I'm trying to make is there's only a couple options, and... Unless somebody decides that they're gonna make a new streaming service, it's probably not gonna happen.
[93:20.05]I forgot to count.
[93:21.15]What am I thinking?
[93:30.10]Nothing over there, too, right?
[93:34.54]I think I can just grab that, can't I?
[93:36.06]If I jump high enough.
[93:38.87]Should've counted.
[93:41.61]Shit.
[93:41.83]It's the same reason I can, like, I complain about, like, for instance, like, El Gato, right?
[93:47.50]Like, oh, this... The HD game capture.
[93:49.98]I fucking hate this thing.
[93:51.26]I can't...
[93:55.13]Nobody else makes these- Whoa!
[93:57.67]That gas got, like, more intense.
[94:01.53]Nobody else makes these fucking things.
[94:03.15]Like, there's, like, two companies that make them.
[94:07.11]Oh, that's... Okay.
[94:20.45]Oh, shit.
[94:20.97]Okay.
[94:21.59]Whoa, is that a- was that a big one?
[94:30.67]Let's go down just so I can complete that and we'll take a left.
[94:35.01]I don't think I can.
[94:35.77]I can't get it.
[94:36.91]Well, it was either up or down, so.
[94:46.51]Hmm.
[94:52.94]Let's try to jump up and around.
[94:54.14]Oh, wait a minute.
[94:57.56]I gotta be careful here.
[95:06.60]Wow.
[95:06.94]That... Okay.
[95:16.87]I don't like this.
[95:18.01]I don't like how... Okay, I'm good.
[95:21.37]I forgot!
[95:21.99]I forgot that fucking acid was... I forgot.
[95:24.51]I just forgot.
[95:25.67]I just forgot.
[95:26.85]That's it.
[95:28.11]I was too busy... I just forgot.
[95:29.85]That's it.
[95:30.37]I just fucking forgot that that was real.
[95:32.93]I...
[95:45.79]What just fucking happened?
[95:46.79]I just got knocked out of space.
[95:48.65]Why would I put these in the level, Ed?
[95:51.03]Why'd you do that?
[95:52.37]Don't do that to me.
[95:54.27]I got hit by that fucking, like, little... Like, little nub.
[95:58.79]God, now I'm just fucking... Now I'm just fucking derailing.
[96:03.40]Which happens in these games.
[96:08.39]Once you derail in a... Edmund... Edmund... Whatever his fucking name is, you know what I mean?
[96:13.58]It's got a lot of syllables, okay?
[96:21.82]It's the worst because it's in the water and it's moving around.
[96:24.63]I should just jump over it.
[96:35.07]What am I doing?
[96:36.13]I don't need to do this.
[96:41.94]I don't have to do that.
[96:42.80]Wait a minute.
[96:48.75]This is not going to be good.
[96:53.17]Wow.
[96:57.80]Hey, I made it.
[97:00.22]Sausage Egg McMillan.
[97:06.40]He's got a lot of cell buttons.
[97:07.32]He's got a lot of M's.
[97:09.51]He's got a lot of M's.
[97:12.96]He's got a lot of M's that are placed strategically to mess you up.
[97:20.67]Not Edward.
[97:22.01]He flipped the M upside down.
[97:23.71]He flipped the W upside down.
[97:25.69]Edward McMillan.
[97:27.57]Edward McMillan.
[97:28.69]No, he turned the fucking W upside down.
[97:30.49]Edmund.
[97:31.19]Edmurd.
[97:32.15]Edmund McMillan.
[97:33.55]It's hard.
[97:34.85]It's hard to say word.
[97:38.64]Last night I had a dream.
[97:39.82]It was of someone telling me you can access the map via the pause menu.
[97:46.31]What does it mean?
[97:49.85]I don't know.
[97:50.29]What does it mean?
[97:50.75]You're telling me I don't get the link to the past bombs here?
[97:55.65]They look very breakable.
[97:56.87]I can't destroy those?
[98:04.63]Just stay here.
[98:06.71]And go down.
[98:09.64]Oh, the hollows.
[98:12.96]So it's a branching world.
[98:14.12]Okay.
[98:22.38]The W is upside down because he doesn't have a W. Thank you, Juba, for the bits.
[98:31.06]How long are your middle fingers combined in inches?
[98:37.49]I don't know.
[98:40.44]I have no idea.
[98:41.10]I can't even... I can't give you a correct response to that.
[98:45.02]Anyways, thank you, Raven Dusk.
[98:48.48]For the bits as well.
[98:49.96]Hey, Jerma, you're a cutie.
[98:51.44]Well, thank you.
[98:53.90]Wait, you can see me.
[98:54.93]It's taken years for my eye holes to adjust to the light down here.
[98:59.65]I feel like you just gotta go fast.
[99:02.05]You can, you know.
[99:03.85]You just gotta bear down hard.
[99:05.33]If you go fast enough, you can straight up smash through stuff.
[99:09.43]It's amazingly painful, but eventually your bones just fragment.
[99:12.73]And the little sack body of yours will become like some kind of being bag type thing.
[99:17.21]You are cute.
[99:18.17]Can I touch your nibs?
[99:19.33]What the fuck?
[99:21.11]I got dark really quickly.
[99:22.49]Alright, let's do it.
[99:25.13]So, uh, holding... Yeah, R2 is to go down.
[99:28.09]I want that.
[99:39.77]God damn it, come on.
[99:43.79]Got it.
[99:45.83]Uh... What does it want me to do?
[99:48.80]Forward and... What button is that on the left?
[99:55.86]What button is that?
[99:58.60]There's no, like, breast with a plus mark on it.
[100:05.93]I don't know what it wants me to do.
[100:09.64]Is this teaching me how to jump?
[100:25.44]Okay.
[100:37.14]I guess that's how we're going to do it.
[100:47.05]Damn it.
[100:51.15]Oh, wow.
[100:51.49]That's going to be hard.
[100:52.13]Okay.
[100:53.13]I think I can get in one fell swoop, though.
[100:56.20]Fuck.
[100:57.10]I'm missing a lot of these.
[101:05.49]That's so suspicious over there on the left.
[101:22.91]That's what you have to do.
[101:25.75]Or you could just Meat Boy it, you know what I mean?
[101:26.95]Just fucking Meat Boy it.
[101:27.75]Don't even look.
[101:37.27]Nope.
[101:37.83]I did not know that was gonna happen.
[101:38.89]I'm gonna spend more time playing Meat Boy than The Ender's Knife.
[101:58.27]You know what I mean?
[101:58.99]Like, just play Meepo.
[102:00.57]This is not the same.
[102:01.40]Who cares if it's the same game, Ed?
[102:07.72]I can't break that.
[102:08.46]Can I jump on these guys?
[102:25.36]No.
[102:27.02]Well, I had to try.
[102:31.26]Whoops.
[102:38.72]Don't know why I got out of my safe spot.
[102:46.01]Wait for the jelly bean to come back over here.
[102:48.77]Weird, like, fucking pickle thing.
[102:54.83]That was close.
[102:56.01]That was very close.
[102:57.05]I almost lost to infinity.
[102:58.87]Remember when I made that fucking funny voice?
[103:06.44]Now I'm just reaching, because I'm nervous.
[103:08.40]Alright, calm down.
[103:16.10]Slow it down here, dude.
[103:16.82]Come on.
[103:17.12]What are you thinking?
[103:21.91]I feel like I need to break this.
[103:29.67]I have to try to break that.
[103:30.71]I do.
[103:36.57]What is going on in this room?
[103:39.59]Oh, I'm dead.
[103:47.13]Ah, it's still falling.
[103:47.98]Am I in the right spot?
[103:53.98]Oh, I am.
[103:54.46]Good.
[103:58.17]What the?
[103:58.75]Come on, dude.
[103:59.95]No way.
[104:00.91]I thought that was a bush.
[104:09.41]Oh my god.
[104:11.10]They're not the same.
[104:12.34]They don't look the same.
[104:23.91]No more bushes, right?
[104:28.90]Keep going.
[104:29.90]I got a cartridge.
[104:36.11]Anywhere else?
[104:37.43]No.
[104:38.11]Let's go see what it is.
[104:38.89]I'm taking a drink.
[104:46.00]Don't count.
[104:47.46]Don't count that one.
[104:49.32]Why am I starting from here?
[104:51.04]What's this weird checkpoint I got?
[105:04.76]Where is he going?
[105:05.60]He's freaking me out.
[105:07.00]He's up and down.
[105:07.76]Down.
[105:08.96]Got it.
[105:18.71]I got it.
[105:19.19]I know how to do it.
[105:23.65]I don't know how to do it.
[105:24.41]I thought I did.
[105:30.98]Come on.
[105:33.50]Come on.
[105:44.84]I swear to God, I fucking don't like that little pixel bullshit.
[105:48.23]That's a lot of pixel bullshit.
[106:00.65]Again, I need to be playing Meat Boy.
[106:16.70]Alright, I need to like just calm the fuck down here.
[106:19.48]I'm trying to go way too fast.
[106:28.84]There it is.
[106:29.22]Fuck, this one's like the hardest one I've done so far.
[106:55.15]Just go from the left to the right now.
[107:01.19]I fucked it up.
[107:03.55]We feed on your rage.
[107:05.97]Well, I don't.
[107:06.73]I feed on... I don't know.
[107:12.72]I was going to try to say something, but it didn't work.
[107:21.54]That was it.
[107:23.22]Ugh!
[107:28.83]I like itching my neck and shit.
[107:31.07]Like, you can't play this game if you have an itchy fucking body.
[107:33.41]Like, let's be real.
[107:34.09]You know what I mean?
[107:35.05]If you have an itchy body, you can't play this game.
[107:40.84]That's all.
[107:44.00]If you have like itches, you can't play these fucking games.
[107:48.86]Good luck.
[107:51.58]I gotta be much faster than that.
[107:53.58]If I want the band-aid, I gotta be way faster.
[107:56.69]Just dilly-dallying.
[108:04.20]What are you talking about?
[108:05.08]I'm talking about when you're itchy, you can't play this game because you have to concentrate so intently.
[108:09.22]You can't pause.
[108:11.54]You can't put the controller down to do this shit.
[108:14.62]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[108:27.83]Oh no.
[108:30.81]On the left?
[108:35.43]Of course.
[108:44.93]Why?
[108:45.95]Why?
[108:46.19]There's no reason to do that.
[108:48.12]There's no reason to do that.
[108:49.46]There isn't.
[108:50.92]Why did you... Come on, dude.
[108:55.10]That is like... So... I'm not... No, I gotta do it again.
[108:58.40]Holy shit.
[109:08.67]Well, okay.
[109:12.45]And I didn't latch on.
[109:14.25]I'm starting to hate this level.
[109:26.83]Finally, I'm done with this madness.
[109:37.19]I can get it.
[109:39.57]I can get it.
[109:42.15]I can do it.
[109:46.47]Told you.
[109:51.93]This perfectly placed fucking spike.
[110:15.68]Going down.
[110:36.30]Oh, that's so infuriating.
[110:38.04]That is so infuriating.
[110:40.31]It's so sloppy.
[110:42.01]It's the sloppiest fucking thing.
[110:43.57]It's like a sloppy joke covered in fucking red sauce.
[110:47.89]Trying to go the fuck up here with this dumb thing is like, God, give me like an extra millisecond, Ed.
[110:54.76]God.
[110:58.46]It's really sloppy.
[110:59.26]It just is.
[111:01.66]Like, you guys buy this game and you tell me how sloppy this fucking part of the game is.
[111:07.95]When you have to go in the water and jump out of the water.
[111:10.67]Fucking sloppy bullshit.
[111:15.09]Would you make this in a fucking afternoon?
[111:25.65]What happened, Ed?
[111:27.23]Would you make this sound like a fucking Sunday brunch?
[111:33.43]No, I'm kidding.
[111:33.93]This game's fun.
[111:34.47]Don't worry.
[111:48.75]You just get like wedged into the corner.
[111:50.61]Here's the problem, right?
[111:51.87]When you try to come up, the weird like detection of the edges, you just get wedged into them.
[111:59.08]It makes for not a fucking interesting time.
[112:05.26]How did he get in here?
[112:06.84]How did he get in here?
[112:07.48]Don't fuck this up.
[112:08.22]How did you get in here?
[112:12.38]I'm going up.
[112:15.06]Okay, I got it.
[112:16.24]Fuck that shit, man.
[112:27.93]Keep going.
[112:33.32]Oh, okay.
[112:38.48]Get that key.
[112:39.56]How am I supposed to get the key?
[112:47.20]Sometimes when Jerma is angry, you can hear his split personality tomato.
[112:51.73]Tomato?
[113:04.11]I have to Super Mario down that pipe?
[113:08.18]Are you for real?
[113:17.80]Really?
[113:18.45]I got another complaint about this.
[113:21.79]Could you have made the sound, like, even, even, like, 5% less fucking obnoxious?
[113:29.31]Could you have made that sound anything else?
[113:32.57]I don't care what it is.
[113:33.15]It could be a fucking zebra.
[113:34.51]It could be a zebra screaming, for all I care, and it would be better.
[113:43.51]Keep crying, you tomato.
[113:47.58]But for real, though, it's, like, giving me anxiety.
[113:57.45]I can't go through the pipe.
[113:58.71]Is that what you're trying to tell me?
[114:03.11]I have audio sliders, sure, but, like, if I turn them down, you guys are gonna, like, be like, I can't hear it, right?
[114:12.57]See, now you guys can't even hear, like, the fucking game.
[114:16.64]You can't go in.
[114:17.44]You can't... You can't go down the... I got fucking... Chat baited me.
[114:22.58]I got fucking baited by chat, and that's what happened.
[114:24.64]That's good.
[114:26.62]I'm glad that happened.
[114:27.60]Hey, Mario can go through pipes.
[114:41.27]Four chests.
[114:43.89]You missed a chest back there, dude.
[114:46.59]I can't wait till I'm done with this fucking water shit, man.
[114:49.69]I really can't.
[114:50.50]Like, this is awful.
[115:07.11]Can I just hang on here?
[115:07.85]I'm not gonna get grabbed, right?
[115:13.92]Jesus.
[115:15.96]Fucking water levels.
[115:17.48]Itchy nose.
[115:37.05]Water levels are the swamps from Dark Souls.
[115:38.51]They really are.
[115:38.87]That's a really good point.
[115:59.47]Holy fuckin' my miii-
[116:03.59]Okay, we're good.
[116:09.59]Okay, I bumped my head on this.
[116:10.57]Is something in there?
[116:17.22]What was in there?
[116:20.00]Nothing?
[116:22.84]That doesn't matter.
[116:30.89]What's the endgame when you get this, by the way?
[116:33.69]There is no endgame.
[116:40.27]I'm not gonna get it.
[116:40.86]There's no end game.
[116:44.28]There's no victory there.
[116:53.20]Okay, there is a victory.
[116:54.28]I see how it is.
[117:03.87]Ah, you son of a... You son of a... Oh, you're a fucking real sharp one, aren't ya?
[117:10.58]Ooh, a real sharp one.
[117:13.24]Wait.
[117:14.24]No.
[117:16.70]What do I use to stream?
[117:17.50]I use OBS.
[117:18.98]OBS Studio.
[117:22.35]Sometimes OBS Studio just has really odd issues.
[117:26.11]And makes you spend lots of money on something that you wanted to really, really impress your friends with.
[117:32.35]But you can't.
[117:33.03]You're not allowed to impress your friends.
[117:38.95]I could have got that, but I don't care.
[117:54.87]Goal Gotha.
[117:56.81]What character am I?
[118:06.69]I guess I'm going this way.
[118:12.02]I'm only at 30% completion, by the way.
[118:16.55]Which is really, like, what?
[118:18.27]Like, 50%?
[118:18.53]Because that includes getting everything from all the levels, right?
[118:22.54]So, like, 40%?
[118:25.22]What did I eat for breakfast?
[118:31.58]Um... What did I have for breakfast?
[118:39.05]Oh, I played the new console again.
[118:40.31]That's right.
[118:40.69]I did get one.
[118:42.79]Good call.
[118:46.79]Catastrovania.
[118:50.28]Oh, Catastrovake.
[118:54.28]I was splitting the word up.
[118:55.44]Look, it looks like there's a space after the S. Catastrovania.
[119:01.02]Oh my god, whatever.
[119:09.03]Look, I was looking at the fucking one on the left.
[119:12.03]I wasn't looking at the right.
[119:13.02]I was looking at the text on the left.
[119:15.32]And after the first S, there's a little space there.
[119:18.90]I thought it was Russian.
[119:21.70]You know, thought it was Russia.
[119:24.02]Could have been Russia.
[119:24.70]It was possible.
[119:27.38]I'm trying to reach out of there.
[119:28.36]I'm trying to get out of the bag, and I didn't get there.
[119:33.43]Do you have to get all the coins?
[119:36.89]I think I have to get all the coins.
[119:39.80]Oh, I have so- Okay, hold on.
[119:41.32]Exit card.
[119:45.85]That diaper must be pretty tight.
[119:47.21]I'm not gonna be able to do this.
[119:52.85]Who can do this?
[120:05.66]Political genius.
[120:16.88]I'm 20% of the way there, but it's just below like four lives for no reason.
[120:22.04]I'd be okay Nice job No, not a nice job, where am I where's the character there is and I didn't understand I
[120:51.83]I didn't... Get the fucking mouse off the screen.
[120:54.51]That's what did it.
[121:00.43]You know, you really get to see, like, what kind of person somebody is.
[121:04.39]When they, uh... When they play a game like this in front of you.
[121:10.80]You can see their secrets.
[121:12.78]Their secrets are coming out.
[121:16.22]You don't hide anything when you play a game like this.
[121:19.33]You can't be like, ooh, whoopsie daisy, whoopsie doodle.
[121:22.91]No, you're gonna say horrible shit.
[121:24.15]You're gonna say something terrible that you regret.
[121:25.73]And, like, everyone's gonna know the kind of person that you are.
[121:29.50]This is me.
[121:31.06]This is me.
[121:31.88]Sometimes it's like, sometimes I get like this.
[121:34.22]You've heard it.
[121:34.62]I'm a vegan.
[121:40.94]No, that's not what I mean.
[121:42.69]Give me that.
[121:57.42]Vegan.
[121:58.58]Oh, my lord.
[121:59.43]See?
[122:01.67]You thought I was stupid.
[122:02.63]You have to drop down to get that one.
[122:05.93]And then you scoop-de-doodle on this guy.
[122:08.09]Yep.
[122:09.23]Hmm.
[122:18.40]No.
[122:21.24]No.
[122:23.01]So I have to go up to that one on the left.
[122:24.63]Do I?
[122:24.99]I think so, yeah.
[122:29.71]Yep.
[122:32.40]Okay, don't go up too high.
[122:33.60]I don't know what that is.
[122:45.74]Shit!
[122:47.16]One life left.
[122:47.82]I gotta get 30 more coins.
[122:51.46]Just like two more levels, essentially.
[122:52.90]I'm not gonna get it.
[123:05.01]I didn't count.
[123:05.77]And that was my downfall.
[123:08.12]Get out of my way, you fucking mouse.
[123:10.30]I just...
[123:45.71]Wait.
[123:47.79]I got continues.
[123:49.19]Holy shit.
[123:57.23]I'm freaking out.
[123:57.71]Calm down.
[124:02.42]Stop.
[124:03.02]My blood is pumping.
[124:04.30]Stop it.
[124:14.12]What the fuck, man?
[124:15.06]It just didn't...
[124:18.69]I swear to god I'm gonna fucking shoot.
[124:21.39]I'm gonna shoot my blood.
[124:43.67]I fell off.
[124:52.33]I swear to God, it's this like slippery ass fucking controller!
[124:57.49]Oh my God!
[124:58.43]I... Honest to God, like, I just, it was, I just, I fucking, I just, I can do that.
[125:08.20]Oh, I'm so fucking mad right now.
[125:10.50]I can't... No, I don't want to play this one.
[125:16.81]Ugh!
[125:24.03]It hurts I'm on tilt right now, and I can't control it If I could turn my webcam on it somebody dumped water on my controller somebody dumped a fucking bottle of water on my controller on my hands and Then they spit in my face
[125:46.38]And then they ran me over with a car.
[125:48.30]That's how I feel right now.
[125:49.38]Get, I'm out.
[125:50.46]I can't even fucking do it.
[125:51.46]I'm fucking, it's too, it's too stressful.
[125:54.32]I'm just gonna go back and play the fucking, oh, I had it too.
[126:00.77]Oh, I'm, ah, it's like, I'm on stream too.
[126:03.13]It's like I'm in front of an audience.
[126:04.75]Like, that's another thing.
[126:05.45]Let's talk about that.
[126:07.70]Like, when you like fucking, when you got, okay, imagine this.
[126:10.18]Imagine like somebody tells you to do something.
[126:12.69]And you're like, okay, that sounds good.
[126:15.29]I'll like dig that hole.
[126:16.59]There's a hole over there.
[126:17.28]I'm going to dig it.
[126:17.76]That's fine.
[126:18.40]Let me dig that hole.
[126:20.74]I can do that very perfectly fine.
[126:21.98]Let me put 2,000 people in the room.
[126:23.92]And they're all staring at you.
[126:25.44]And they're like, you didn't dig deep enough on that side.
[126:28.56]Like one guy in the very back is like, hey, you're a fucking loser.
[126:33.53]And I'm like, just trying to dig a fucking hole, man.
[126:35.57]Like, come on.
[126:36.81]And like the two people in the front are like kissing.
[126:40.13]Like, what the fuck is going on here?
[126:55.71]I had it, too.
[126:56.75]I just, like, blew it because my hands got all sweaty and I couldn't stop.
[126:59.27]And I thought about, like, the guy, like, laughing at me in the back of the room.
[127:04.33]That one guy from Happy Gilmore.
[127:07.13]You guys remember Happy Gilmore?
[127:08.40]The one guy that fucking laughs and, like, talks shit to Happy Gilmore the whole movie?
[127:14.26]One of you guys is that guy.
[127:16.32]And I was sitting there going, like, they're fucking sitting there thinking I suck and, like, shut up.
[127:23.77]Yeah, you jackass.
[127:27.98]Damn it.
[127:29.33]Whatever.
[127:39.85]I had it too.
[127:40.55]Once I figured out I had the... Well, I was so stressed out from having the first... Not knowing about the first continue.
[127:45.39]That I just... I just was over at that point.
[127:50.98]Like, I couldn't ever recompose myself.
[127:54.24]It's like a picture.
[127:55.82]When a pitcher gets like three back-to-back home runs, back-to-back-to-back home runs off of him, don't matter if he's got a 1.02 ERA, that pitcher's gonna, you gotta get him out of the game.
[128:07.80]You have to get that pitcher out of the game.
[128:15.27]How do I do this?
[128:26.74]Remember we talked about, like, make sure... Tell, like, all your... Tell all your friends to play games like this so then you can, like, see who they really are.
[128:34.20]I'm trying to figure this one out.
[128:40.11]Let's talk sports.
[128:42.93]I need, like, a drink is what I need.
[128:44.81]I need, like, a vodka tonic.
[128:50.57]I think I'm over him, I think.
[128:54.82]You only watch the stream for baseball talk?
[128:57.92]There we go.
[129:06.95]And I'm sorry, like, I'm sorry.
[129:09.03]Let me just, like, let's go over this too.
[129:12.89]If I'm, like, getting embarrassed on the stream, like, I do something stupid, then you guys are all here watching it.
[129:19.45]So, obviously, I'm gonna be like, no, no, it's not what you think.
[129:23.09]Shut up.
[129:24.27]I didn't do anything.
[129:25.07]It's not my fault.
[129:25.95]The fucking game was like a troll.
[129:27.27]I had sweat on it and I didn't know what to do.
[129:32.81]Look, there's fucking 60 billion people here watching this.
[129:38.38]And I know there's only like 10 billion people on the planet.
[129:40.84]I understand that.
[129:41.66]I'm talking about the other fucking galaxies and the other people on the fucking dozens of other galaxies that are watching this channel right now.
[129:48.72]So you guys are watching on twitch.tv.
[129:53.49]You don't know about fucking Glapcorp.
[129:55.89]There's fucking 9200 people watching on fucking Glapcorp right now.
[130:03.18]A lot of people.
[130:04.80]You don't know them, they're on a different planet.
[130:14.16]I've not lost it.
[130:15.84]I'm still here.
[130:19.79]Where are the other 3 billion from?
[130:23.00]I don't know.
[130:23.32]I was about to just say something really, really dumb.
[130:26.22]And, like, potentially get myself in a lot of trouble on Twitch.
[130:30.48]It's like I didn't say it.
[130:33.97]Let me pay attention for a minute here.
[130:38.35]I don't think I can make this.
[130:40.49]I've been trying over and over again, so I don't know why I continue to try.
[130:43.98]Wait, what?
[130:59.08]Wait, what was that doing?
[131:02.58]Okay.
[131:05.70]Um... Oh, they block it off so you can't do that.
[131:09.34]Okay, I get you.
[131:10.32]I get you, Ed.
[131:14.90]Glapcorp, yeah.
[131:19.32]Glapcorp.shpongle There's more than one internet, guys.
[131:25.79]And let me tell you something, Schmoggle is way, way faster.
[131:29.69]6,000 terabytes up.
[131:38.28]6,000 terabytes a second up.
[131:45.40]Oh, come on.
[131:45.88]I mean, how many Mario references can you have in one game, Ed?
[132:09.34]You guys think 4K is good?
[132:10.83]Okay, humans.
[132:16.51]Oh, 4K is so good.
[132:17.55]Let's wait till there's no Ks anymore.
[132:37.60]Why is there a cannonball at me?
[132:50.82]Where's the exit?
[132:51.44]Um... What the fuck is going on here?
[133:06.69]I actually may have lost my mind, because I don't know where the exit here is.
[133:14.83]Uh...
[133:27.76]There is no exit.
[133:33.80]Where are those balls of fire even coming from?
[133:35.96]Do I have to go down to the left?
[133:39.14]I don't think I can even make that.
[133:52.57]Um... I don't see any, like, hooks or anything.
[133:59.39]I gotta grab one of the hooks.
[134:06.08]The only thing I can think of is I have to activate this all and then turn around.
[134:09.30]How the fuck?
[134:16.38]I don't understand why you have to have this stupid fucking thing flying around.
[134:21.58]That thing serves no purpose, dude.
[134:23.00]Why does it have to keep flying around?
[134:31.64]My plan was a disaster, by the way.
[134:33.36]It was a miserable failure.
[134:52.64]God.
[135:02.84]There's nothing over there, too.
[135:03.68]I mean, I can see all the... Maybe I just keep chipping the wall away?
[135:10.03]I don't understand.
[135:11.23]Those are not hooks.
[135:16.87]Uh-oh.
[135:24.01]I just let the train hit me.
[135:27.13]I was so done.
[135:28.73]Just let it hit me.
[135:29.73]I don't even care anymore.
[135:58.06]They just put that stupid spinning cheese wheel to drive you fucking insane There's no what that stupid thing doesn't exist for any other reason The flaming cheese wheel doesn't it just it's only here to make you angry You can tell when he was putting that in he was like shaking his head up and down he was going like yeah deal with this one streamers and
[136:43.30]Fucking kidding me.
[136:58.03]Is that a hook right there?
[137:01.25]I can't get up there though.
[137:02.17]How am I supposed to get that hook?
[137:03.11]Do I have to like jump from... Oh, this is bad, bad, bad.
[137:07.57]Oh, this is bad.
[137:30.32]I got it.
[137:31.12]Now what do I do?
[137:32.56]Get me out of here.
[137:34.42]Let it be over.
[137:34.94]Please let it be over.
[137:36.76]I don't even want to do this.
[137:38.44]I thought my whole body just hurt.
[137:41.36]Somebody stabbed me three times in the stomach.
[137:51.11]Can I aggro this guy or what?
[138:15.28]Okay, you glitched out twice.
[138:28.38]How come he just doesn't come out sometimes?
[138:29.94]I don't get it.
[138:32.90]Like, why does he do that?
[138:34.20]I don't understand.
[138:36.09]Sometimes he just doesn't come out.
[138:47.35]I'm so screwed here.
[138:48.31]Is this safe?
[139:04.44]I think it is.
[139:10.30]Safe.
[139:17.95]Safe.
[139:23.52]Wow!
[139:27.34]Did I blow it?
[139:31.38]Whoa!
[139:39.81]Guys, how do I beat the level?
[139:43.27]Like, I mean, I got this secret thing, but what... How do I...
[139:48.27]How do I complete the mission?
[139:50.21]How do I get out of here?
[140:13.20]All the way to the right.
[140:14.08]There's a hook on the right.
[140:20.12]Damn it, like down there?
[140:21.02]I fucking fell off.
[140:40.51]Oh, right there.
[140:45.73]Like, could you have made it, like, a little less, like, fucking conspicuous?
[140:50.64]Like, it's just so inconspicuous, you know what I mean?
[141:00.61]I guess I gotta climb that.
[141:03.33]This is the worst level in the whole game.
[141:08.03]It's not a difficult level, it's just, like, this is... I don't like this.
[141:12.96]It's not hard.
[141:14.16]I don't like this.
[141:22.63]Oh my lord in heaven.
[141:24.73]Hallowed be thy fucking god damn name.
[141:28.15]Kingdom come and shit and that will be done on Earth.
[141:35.15]Give us this day and eat some bread.
[141:37.23]As we forgive those who trespass against you and me and that person and your dog and shit.
[141:41.77]Like, you know what I mean?
[141:42.39]Like, come on.
[141:47.71]That wasn't even the right thing to do.
[141:59.41]Jeremy for Pope.
[142:07.02]Doing a lot of religion talk, huh?
[142:08.50]I don't know why.
[142:11.16]I don't want to be like a guy that's like, religion is so stupid.
[142:15.65]You're an idiot.
[142:19.07]Alright, play the game.
[142:23.51]Yeah?
[142:23.95]Well... What about, like, the fact that... Fucking Slimer is gonna get me every time.
[142:38.36]I just want to get away from this guy.
[142:52.50]I mean, I could go up there, but I just want to get out of there.
[142:54.80]I want to at least get the level loaded here.
[142:56.40]Get the fuck out of here.
[143:03.89]Forget it.
[143:11.95]Come on.
[143:16.99]Jump.
[143:21.11]Come on.
[143:21.75]Jump.
[143:23.93]Come on, jump.
[143:31.46]Come on, I gotta get the plankton.
[143:34.30]I have not been picking up very many planktons.
[143:36.70]It's not good.
[143:41.24]It's a Super Mario 3 guy.
[143:42.74]It is the Super Mario 3 son guy, isn't it?
[143:57.29]Oh, do you get back up after breaking that?
[143:59.23]Oh, no.
[144:00.29]Oh, that's how you... Sorry, Plankton.
[144:04.42]How did I do that?
[144:23.99]Shit.
[144:31.73]Oh shit.
[144:32.41]Oh god.
[144:32.85]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[144:34.11]Forget it.
[144:34.43]Go.
[144:34.49]Alright, there's a guy.
[144:36.23]There's a guy right there.
[144:40.04]Spikes.
[144:42.74]Okay.
[144:46.42]Okay.
[144:47.94]Okay.
[144:52.07]You gotta hang on the edge after doing that.
[144:53.65]It's gonna be tough.
[145:30.91]Fuck me.
[145:31.73]That's so difficult to get that.
[145:37.26]I just like calm down here.
[145:43.42]No.
[145:44.02]Oh, I'm just rushing.
[145:45.12]I hate it.
[145:45.68]I hate this.
[145:46.90]I hate this.
[145:48.48]I hate rushing.
[146:05.97]Well, we don't go there.
[146:07.95]Drink some haterade.
[146:13.09]I hate this web.
[146:21.96]That part would have killed me if I jumped, right?
[146:28.46]There it is.
[146:30.78]Let me look over here.
[146:31.46]Oh, so we got... I gotta hang on that little thing on the right.
[146:44.13]Finally got a tumor.
[146:54.28]Well, he can see.
[146:56.94]What's the timer on these?
[146:59.34]That's like an odd timer.
[147:02.54]Let's see.
[147:04.28]One, two.
[147:08.36]one two alright so it's one two no I didn't count it didn't count one two how long are they up for one two three they're off on three one two three one two three
[147:38.36]One, two.
[147:39.14]He can't go down that far.
[147:41.80]Why did he go down that far?
[147:43.92]Why did he go down?
[147:44.78]That's not fucking fair.
[147:56.33]Get out of my life.
[148:00.87]Oh, no.
[148:02.75]Does it come back down?
[148:03.79]Of course it does.
[148:16.06]This is going to be tricky.
[148:20.62]Oh, just wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[148:23.46]Come down here.
[148:26.88]It's fast.
[148:27.86]That's fast.
[148:36.33]That's fast.
[148:45.66]That's fast, boys and girls.
[148:49.62]Shit.
[148:49.94]It needs to be the other side, I think.
[148:53.64]We're good.
[148:58.67]Didn't even bother to look.
[149:03.01]Can he... Can he go across here?
[149:08.37]Come this way.
[149:11.27]I don't think you can go over that way.
[149:14.11]Oh, well.
[149:17.65]That's so fast.
[149:18.63]It's too quick.
[149:24.75]What?
[149:26.43]Why?
[149:28.85]I was just trying to jump over it.
[149:30.26]I was trying to jump the fucking thing.
[149:32.90]I did it.
[149:34.24]I didn't do it.
[149:36.28]I did it.
[149:36.66]I did it.
[149:37.12]Okay.
[149:37.68]Good.
[149:39.90]There can't be much more.
[149:45.21]Well, that's one way to do it.
[150:01.74]God damn it.
[150:16.50]That's how you do it.
[150:20.12]Please, latch on.
[150:20.94]You know, part of me wishes there was a button that you had to actually hold.
[150:36.66]Instead of just automatically grabbing ledges.
[150:48.22]My god.
[150:52.59]I don't even care.
[150:53.75]This has been the worst.
[150:55.47]This is worse than the other one.
[150:57.23]Fuck this place.
[150:58.05]This is worse than the water level.
[151:00.06]A thousand times worse.
[151:06.50]How did it let go?
[151:14.65]Would you like to grab a ledge?
[151:16.19]I'll take a ledge for fucking 1400, Pat.
[151:20.03]I'll take please fucking god in heaven grab ledge for 1400, Pat.
[151:26.20]No.
[151:26.80]No, you won't.
[151:27.98]No, you won't do that.
[151:29.76]You won't.
[151:30.56]You'll just jump over it because it moves too fast.
[151:32.36]He forgot to program that in the game.
[151:54.26]What a bad program.
[152:00.99]I gotta jump on top of it, is what I have to do.
[152:05.45]It just goes too fast.
[152:11.27]Grab a ledge for only one pavement.
[152:30.13]Not worth it.
[152:31.42]Is it worth it?
[152:33.90]Is it worth it?
[152:34.88]It's not worth it.
[152:36.22]It wasn't worth it.
[152:37.14]It wasn't worth it.
[152:37.68]What I said is it worth it.
[152:39.44]It was not worth it.
[152:40.84]You already answered the question.
[152:42.15]It's not worth it.
[152:44.39]Get out of here.
[152:46.17]Oh.
[152:47.49]My fucking god.
[152:51.77]Just walk out.
[152:52.86]Walk out of the mission.
[152:53.58]It's...
[153:05.12]We can just walk out, please.
[153:14.19]And then you die.
[153:15.27]Okay.
[153:15.77]So you die.
[153:16.21]You have to just go.
[153:22.93]There it is.
[153:24.24]Forget about the pandas.
[153:25.10]They're getting far too difficult to care about at this point.
[153:32.06]What?
[153:32.58]Oh, please.
[153:39.02]Wow!
[153:45.90]I don't know if I was safe.
[153:46.98]Would I have been safe there?
[153:48.00]I don't know.
[153:51.30]Let's find out.
[153:52.72]No, let's not find out.
[153:58.39]Nope, not safe.
[154:10.13]Oh.
[154:13.07]What's this guy?
[154:19.04]Uh.
[154:21.66]What did I get?
[154:22.22]What is that?
[154:23.32]It's got, like, a Mega Man suit.
[154:26.16]He's gonna play Minecraft after this.
[154:29.51]Uh, no.
[154:29.97]No, he is not gonna play Minecraft.
[154:31.77]I can assure you of that one.
[154:38.35]Hmm.
[154:39.38]Mother calls out for you.
[154:40.72]She requires a hundred souls to allow entry.
[154:43.62]Come back when you have harvested more.
[154:45.18]Okay.
[154:50.80]I need a hundred.
[154:57.55]Does it go far down enough where I can jump down?
[154:59.47]No, it does not.
[155:04.13]Okay.
[155:06.13]I missed a lot.
[155:16.19]Last time I had a dream, it was of someone telling me you can access the map via the... I already read this.
[155:20.67]I got... Why does it say triangle?
[155:24.67]When that was very clearly square, my friend.
[155:26.87]Stop it.
[155:27.47]I don't want to... Jump should not be talk to guy.
[155:30.71]Listen.
[155:31.67]Listen.
[155:33.43]Jump should not be talk to person.
[155:38.57]Pressing X...
[155:41.16]Thank you.
[155:43.52]Thank you.
[155:47.68]Retrograde.
[155:48.78]I like this place.
[155:52.84]Wait, why is it not doing that here?
[155:53.94]It was doing it before.
[155:56.39]Did you know if you squish down and jump, you can kind of slide through those areas?
[156:00.83]Over there.
[156:02.19]Your bones may get stuck on the sharp parts, but at least you've accomplished something.
[156:06.49]Look at you.
[156:07.63]What if sliding into tight spaces?
[156:11.23]pitiful.
[156:13.55]The pacing of this game is much slower than Meat Boy.
[156:16.17]It is.
[156:16.39]It's far, far slower.
[156:24.44]Alright, so I can squish through, right?
[156:28.12]Yep.
[156:30.14]That's how... That's how you do it.
[156:32.80]I think I can go up there, but...
[156:45.05]Ouch.
[156:49.75]I could get those.
[156:51.87]Maybe not.
[156:58.27]Mm-hmm.
[156:59.37]Mm-hmm.
[157:04.38]Who cares?
[157:14.30]Ah.
[157:16.43]This is giving me all sorts of confusion.
[157:18.09]It really is.
[157:19.13]This is fucking my brain.
[157:20.73]I just gotta be patient.
[157:33.28]This is just... You know what this is?
[157:34.80]This is Super Meat Boy.
[157:37.78]With times 20 more patients.
[157:42.13]You just have to be patient, and I'm not a patient person.
[157:45.23]I never claimed to be a patient person.
[157:53.78]I- I- I- I- I- I just, like... Speed it up.
[157:58.78]Let's go.
[157:59.18]Goddamn.
[158:11.28]Let's pump it up.
[158:12.04]Yeah, it's time to pump it up.
[158:14.92]What have I done?
[158:17.28]Oh, if you think I'm going downstairs to pick that up, you are.
[158:20.28]That's not gonna happen.
[158:22.66]Not right now.
[158:23.32]Not when I'm, like, brainless right now.
[158:28.53]Oh, okay.
[158:33.59]Crank the song.
[158:38.93]I could turn the music up a little bit if you'd like.
[158:42.06]If you'd like.
[158:47.70]There.
[158:48.48]That's better.
[158:56.83]I missed it.
[158:59.65]And he missed it.
[159:01.15]And he missed it.
[159:01.99]What video?
[159:02.59]Come on.
[159:04.07]What video is that from?
[159:06.62]2013.
[159:06.82]And he missed it.
[159:09.66]He missed it.
[159:28.64]You missed that one.
[159:29.24]No.
[159:30.24]Blue man basketball.
[159:31.20]There it is.
[159:32.48]You got it.
[159:34.42]Yeah, that was when Frank Pizza did not hit the... That's when Frank Pizza did not make... the... toss.
[159:46.53]We did it.
[159:47.35]Good job, Plat.
[159:48.41]Good job, Platadonius.
[159:52.56]Nice work.
[160:00.74]I gotta, like, leave... Do I have to leave, like, two of these or something?
[160:05.49]I have to leave that one.
[160:12.92]Shit.
[160:13.24]I have to go higher.
[160:14.14]Man, I just got rid of the one I needed.
[160:18.74]Yeah.
[160:30.46]Stop hitting R2.
[160:31.65]If you hit R2 one more time accidentally, we're gonna have a big fucking problem, Jeremy.
[160:41.77]He went right over the top.
[160:44.06]I went over the top rope.
[160:47.74]I went right over the top.
[160:58.97]What is this?
[161:02.49]I have to do that too, apparently.
[161:04.35]I'm just trying to speed it up, and you're fucking ruining everything.
[161:20.19]Wait.
[161:21.59]Wait.
[161:28.60]I didn't even get it.
[161:29.28]Let's go.
[161:29.92]Fucking...
[161:33.07]That was interesting.
[161:40.47]That was interesting, too.
[161:41.39]What was that?
[161:43.15]That was very interesting.
[161:52.27]Very interesting.
[161:52.95]I can definitely get up there.
[161:53.81]Let's try that, actually.
[161:55.80]Why not?
[161:57.76]Let's ride the stairway to heaven.
[162:00.99]No, I guess there is nothing up there.
[162:02.37]Let me try this one more time and make sure I didn't miss anything.
[162:11.89]No, there is in fact nothing over there.
[162:16.98]Why is the music off?
[162:19.20]The music's on, man.
[162:25.58]The music's on!
[162:27.52]The music's cranking!
[162:29.57]I think I'm gonna need that.
[162:30.45]I don't even know.
[162:31.91]I might need it.
[162:32.49]I think I do.
[162:44.86]How the hell do I get out?
[162:46.44]Ow!
[162:46.98]Oh, that hurts.
[162:47.60]Ugh.
[162:49.17]Alright.
[162:52.47]I'm sorry.
[162:52.87]I just bumped the mic.
[162:53.63]I just smashed my hand.
[162:54.85]That was very painful.
[162:57.17]I'm so sorry, guys.
[162:59.65]Goddammit.
[163:02.97]That sucked.
[163:05.52]Um... Like this?
[163:13.70]Like that.
[163:14.22]Okay, let's go.
[163:18.38]Every stream I bump the mic, it's because the mic is right over here to the right.
[163:23.12]I don't... I do not have one of those fancy mic stands.
[163:31.37]You know, one of those fancy things that fancy streamers have.
[163:38.36]I was trying to start, like, my fancy stream collection, my fancy stuff collection.
[163:43.00]Didn't work out so well.
[163:46.80]Uh, I'm just gonna leave.
[163:49.30]I need a hundred, right?
[163:53.46]Yeah, I've got a real fancy interface that is not plugged in right now.
[163:56.76]It is doing me no good.
[163:59.88]Jesus.
[164:05.22]There was no speed there.
[164:07.76]Shit.
[164:13.86]Have I died a thousand times yet?
[164:15.58]I can't, I don't know.
[164:20.47]Let's go this way.
[164:35.16]And okay.
[164:37.90]Well.
[164:39.69]Oh my god.
[164:44.53]I don't know.
[164:50.64]Do I just have to get out of the way?
[164:58.26]Like, what the fuck is the rhyme or reason to anything that's going on right now?
[165:08.99]But I didn't get... I didn't get it.
[165:13.13]How do you get over there?
[165:48.56]I have a lot of trouble latching onto these.
[165:52.14]Like, why didn't the notch... I don't get it.
[165:53.92]Especially going up.
[165:57.65]Going up seems... I have a lot of problems latching and going up.
[166:00.83]I don't know why.
[166:16.52]Okay, there's the game, cube.
[166:18.99]What is over there?
[166:20.65]Oh, god.
[166:20.85]Alright.
[166:25.11]Okay.
[166:43.89]Okay.
[166:45.40]Wait.
[166:54.30]Should I just aggro it and then run out of the way?
[166:59.06]What the fuck is happening right now?
[167:03.27]What?
[167:05.03]In the name of fucking God.
[167:26.32]How come I'm not getting aggroed to now?
[167:37.07]Uh...
[167:54.15]Wall jump?
[167:55.55]Where would you like me to wall jump?
[167:57.77]There's no wall jumping in the game.
[167:59.11]Fuck, man.
[168:16.68]This is insane.
[168:27.09]Maybe I have to get to the wall and then jump out?
[168:33.50]How are you supposed to do this?
[168:34.78]This is very confusing.
[168:44.28]Actually, I almost had it.
[168:51.04]I almost had it.
[168:51.70]I almost had it.
[168:52.60]Okay.
[168:56.73]You gotta turn and jump immediately.
[169:01.65]Oh, and they fucking fuck with you!
[169:04.60]And they fuck with you!
[169:05.46]The things come down further!
[169:07.66]The things come down, they change!
[169:09.16]Ayy!
[169:10.16]Goodness!
[169:10.74]Ay caramba!
[169:13.82]They change on ya!
[169:14.74]Got it!
[169:17.27]Get in there!
[169:17.67]Hurry up!
[169:18.17]Holy God!
[169:29.23]First try?
[169:30.59]No.
[169:31.23]Not even close.
[169:42.52]I would go for him, but I don't want to.
[169:45.72]Mother is not pleased?
[169:46.74]Why?
[169:46.96]Why is mother not pleased?
[169:49.75]What do I do?
[169:58.50]Okay, that opens.
[169:59.62]I'm gonna go all the way down for that.
[170:12.55]Why does every level have to have one of these gimmicks?
[170:15.81]Why?
[170:16.23]Come on.
[170:17.05]I don't want to deal with this.
[170:18.29]Give me a floor.
[170:19.35]Give me a floor that works.
[170:20.25]Give me a floor.
[170:20.95]Oh...
[170:39.60]Ah, you gotta get all the way across.
[170:43.44]Just gotta beat the thing back and forth.
[170:51.75]You go over here, got it, that's it.
[170:53.69]I ain't messing around.
[170:55.09]I can't go get that damn thing.
[170:58.17]Streamer begs for mercy on stream.
[171:00.63]Hey, Insaya, thanks for the bits.
[171:02.39]Hey!
[171:02.99]Hey, Jermbo.
[171:04.39]I really enjoyed your cameo in War on Planet of the Apes.
[171:09.84]What?
[171:11.97]I wasn't in that movie, but thank you.
[171:15.31]Also, Angaman, Madman, $3,075.
[171:16.81]Thanks for the bits.
[171:19.67]Soviet Winter, thanks for $2.
[171:21.93]PJ Salt, $100.
[171:24.45]Yes.
[171:25.75]Yes, yes, yes.
[171:27.14]Why is that so funny?
[171:28.06]I don't understand.
[171:32.44]Why is that funny?
[171:34.66]Rise of the Planet of the... War on the Planet of the Apes.
[171:41.40]Aren't those fucking guys like 9 feet tall?
[171:44.02]Is that the joke?
[171:44.74]Is that because I'm small?
[171:49.66]Anyways, thank you SovietWinter for the $2.
[171:52.49]Oh, I can't scroll down.
[171:53.37]I threw my mouse over here.
[171:54.67]Whoops.
[171:56.75]I should probably go get it.
[172:05.07]Uh, yeah.
[172:05.49]I think that's it though.
[172:06.73]Yep.
[172:08.42]Thanks a lot, guys.
[172:11.69]Nine feet tall is bigger than small.
[172:13.89]It is bigger than small.
[172:14.79]Nine feet tall is fucking big, man.
[172:18.12]You ever seen somebody nine feet tall before?
[172:21.06]They're very large.
[172:27.44]The mouse.
[172:31.84]I got a drink in the way.
[172:41.54]Well, I severely screwed that one up.
[172:46.41]Oh, I had it.
[172:52.77]That was it.
[172:53.31]I got it.
[172:54.39]I got it.
[172:57.41]I got it.
[173:02.35]Aye!
[173:04.97]Duh!
[173:06.73]This meal!
[173:10.96]That took way too long to get up there.
[173:47.35]Get up there.
[173:47.81]Get up there, you fucking wanker.
[173:49.19]Alright, good.
[173:56.90]What?
[173:57.30]Oh my god.
[174:12.77]It's just too much.
[174:13.67]It's too crazy.
[174:14.79]It's too crazy.
[174:16.07]I'm going to go back, though, because I want to look at this.
[174:19.80]I got the... What is this?
[174:20.72]The machine?
[174:24.86]Retrograde the machine.
[174:26.30]I don't have 100 yet, do I?
[174:30.00]Okay.
[174:43.44]New gimmick, we have the moving platform things.
[174:46.48]And they've combined gimmicks, so now there's the poison gas here, too.
[174:49.79]Which, uh... Yay.
[174:51.87]You know what I mean?
[174:53.41]Hooray.
[174:55.37]You know what I mean?
[174:56.59]Yay.
[174:59.77]Stupid.
[175:01.69]Stupid, stupid, stupid.
[175:06.99]Thanks for standing still.
[175:11.16]You guy.
[175:11.76]You guy that I got there.
[175:13.32]I gotta pay attention to that.
[175:15.56]I'm not paying any attention.
[175:23.45]Wait till we come back.
[175:25.65]Go through the poison gas.
[175:32.23]Why did they have to combine gimmicks on me?
[175:35.39]How is this a machine, by the way?
[175:38.80]No, you already did this in the other game.
[175:40.58]It's the same game, Ed.
[175:43.55]Hey, same game, Ed.
[175:45.21]Nice work.
[176:09.03]Fuckin' same game, Ed.
[176:13.91]I gotta- let me watch this.
[176:14.89]So that comes up, I gotta jump- no, okay.
[176:17.70]I got it.
[176:22.48]I jumped over it.
[176:23.58]I jumped right over the damn thing.
[176:25.70]At least that one's easy to get.
[176:30.09]I tried to suck onto it.
[176:35.47]I just wanted to suck the damn thing.
[176:38.54]Alright, I'm unraveling.
[176:39.42]Stop unraveling.
[176:51.99]For a second, I kind of had no idea what was going on.
[176:59.63]What?
[177:00.63]Do you fly?
[177:01.75]Can I float in these?
[177:04.34]Jesus, yes, you can.
[177:15.49]Well, there's a hundred, but... I mean, that's gonna be annoying to get.
[177:18.61]I'm gonna have to drop in the perfect place.
[177:29.90]I don't care.
[177:31.74]I don't wanna... get number 100 somewhere else.
[177:51.91]latch it come on streamer counts to a hundred on stream I have to get to 100 at least what time is it right now how late is it 10 o'clock we gotta check out that at the future place or whatever it's gonna be okay don't I'm gonna get hit right in the head
[178:24.33]One, two.
[178:25.81]One, two.
[178:27.25]One, two.
[178:28.63]Go.
[178:31.83]So what's the deal with getting this one?
[178:38.95]Doesn't look like there's a jump anywhere I can do.
[178:45.71]Unless you're talking about these things.
[178:48.35]In which case, good luck to you.
[178:49.93]You know what I mean?
[178:53.24]Maybe talking about that one.
[178:55.14]Good luck to you.
[178:59.69]Somebody's having to shut up.
[179:01.61]I want everyone right now to say, Jeremy, shut up.
[179:13.33]Say, Germany, stop it!
[179:19.23]Let's go over it.
[179:20.81]Let's go over the first one.
[179:33.13]Just float in the other place.
[179:34.93]Just get up there.
[179:42.77]Get up on the ship.
[179:44.73]There's a key here.
[179:45.55]Interestingly enough, I now have a key.
[179:51.15]Whatever the hell that means.
[179:54.98]And there's a credit card there.
[179:59.08]Got the credit card.
[180:02.07]And I just walked into that fucking thing.
[180:08.09]Door.
[180:09.43]Door.
[180:09.73]Everyone's like, door.
[180:14.54]What hit me?
[180:16.04]Tell me.
[180:19.93]I'll wait.
[180:30.41]Hey, show me a more iconic duo.
[180:32.97]I'll wait.
[180:34.31]One hit me.
[180:42.52]Show me more.
[180:43.16]I'll wait.
[180:43.64]Iconic.
[180:49.18]This is gonna be hard.
[181:02.76]I fucking hate you.
[181:06.28]It might be that.
[181:08.08]I might need like a... I might take a break.
[181:18.38]This one is like a living hell.
[181:23.23]And the noise... The noise is going to get to me.
[181:25.09]It is.
[181:25.31]I'm going to be hearing that in my sleep.
[181:32.40]Got it.
[181:33.26]How do I get out of here?
[181:35.88]What's the exit?
[181:41.54]How do I get out?
[181:42.02]How do I leave?
[181:44.46]What do I do?
[181:45.70]I don't want to fuck this up.
[181:46.62]Where do I go?
[181:52.28]There's no exit.
[181:55.40]I have to go left?
[181:58.05]That's dangerous.
[182:02.45]That's too dangerous for me.
[182:03.75]But I just did it anyways.
[182:05.65]Jump into the spikes.
[182:08.86]That one was aimed up.
[182:11.52]Oh no.
[182:17.10]Something falls down.
[182:42.77]I came real close.
[182:44.33]I came real close to turning off the stream.
[182:46.42]That's what that was.
[182:52.56]At the... God, like... Sometimes.
[182:56.82]Sometimes I wonder.
[182:57.82]Have I lost it yet?
[183:02.06]Uh, I think like once, yeah.
[183:05.04]Once or twice.
[183:09.22]I don't like the fact that if you touch the tip of the gun, you die.
[183:13.01]Why is that a thing?
[183:13.93]Because the gun is like hot?
[183:15.95]That's bullshit.
[183:23.71]This might be the end.
[183:25.71]This might be the end of the Friday night fuckface stream.
[183:36.37]I think I might... You know, you...
[183:38.87]Playing games like this, like the Meat Boy type games, like any game that's extreme like this, your energy, like human beings have like a finite battery of energy, you know what I mean?
[183:49.72]Like, we can only use so much of it at a time.
[183:54.64]Playing like three hours of Meat Boy, or like The End is Nigh, is like skiing for a whole day.
[184:01.67]I went skiing.
[184:03.09]The whole day.
[184:03.93]I just got back.
[184:06.39]My back hurts and shit.
[184:19.22]And why shouldn't I?
[184:19.76]You gotta wait till it's up.
[184:28.21]What's up, Wimpy?
[184:30.39]It really does feel like it.
[184:33.97]And I should've waited even longer.
[184:35.68]And, like, I don't have the patience.
[184:36.84]I just got home from a fucking ski trip.
[184:41.22]You know how hard it is to go skiing all day?
[184:42.96]And you know how you feel?
[184:49.00]Like kayaking or something.
[184:57.31]I jumped right in.
[184:59.27]Look, I've never jumped into a bullet before, but I can guarantee you they don't move this slow and this methodically.
[185:05.53]Another thing taken from Mario.
[185:17.07]Okay.
[185:18.45]Got it.
[185:18.69]Alright, now what do I do?
[185:25.75]Middle?
[185:27.91]Middle left?
[185:31.21]How am I gonna ever compete with this?
[185:32.75]Right there, right?
[185:36.49]No?
[185:37.35]No.
[185:37.95]Where is it?
[185:38.79]Where is it?
[185:39.91]Whoa!
[185:41.75]I did it.
[185:45.57]I win.
[185:48.14]Okay, I win.
[185:53.58]I got 100.
[185:59.39]Where's, uh... Where was that slimy fat slob?
[186:05.69]I don't remember where he was.
[186:07.29]Was he in retrograde?
[186:14.81]Let's at least see what these are.
[186:19.81]prostrates.
[186:21.89]I'm right here, Jerma.
[186:23.61]That's my favorite comment of the whole night.
[186:25.21]I'm right here, Jerma.
[186:26.64]I'm right here.
[186:28.38]You need anything, honey?
[186:31.50]Wait, I just fucked up?
[186:34.90]How did I screw it up?
[186:35.72]What did I do?
[186:37.50]The end of... of Goliath land.
[186:43.15]Okay, so... At the end of Golgotha.
[186:52.69]What?
[186:59.05]Which, I don't have to do all this again, right?
[187:02.45]No, I don't.
[187:13.12]Dermacraft Jupiter, it's confirmed now.
[187:15.84]Yes, you do.
[187:21.68]I don't... I don't know if I want to do that.
[187:29.89]I'm not sure I want to do this right now.
[187:31.79]Where should I open the door then?
[187:37.43]This sucks.
[187:38.84]I don't want... Didn't I go in like a teleporter?
[188:04.46]Uh... I want to open a door.
[188:07.30]Hey, get out of here.
[188:09.86]I found that game cart first.
[188:11.92]It's right for the mine, so back off, ugly.
[188:14.36]Seriously, though, back the fuck off.
[188:16.00]I hid that game cartridge ages ago, and I ain't letting no descender touch it.
[188:20.82]You're damn lucky I ain't got no soul.
[188:23.29]Man, I'm glad I built this false wall.
[188:25.79]Really keeps out the riffraff.
[188:27.61]Hey, I said get lost, stinky.
[188:39.32]There's another game cartridge here.
[188:46.74]Oh, that's it.
[188:47.39]I didn't even notice.
[188:47.99]I didn't even see the poison cloud.
[188:52.83]Didn't even see the cloud.
[189:00.32]Okay, I got him.
[189:02.48]Didn't even move.
[189:03.94]Apparently we still died.
[189:08.55]Why didn't I just leave?
[189:09.89]Okay.
[189:10.39]Got the cartridge.
[189:15.49]Just die.
[189:16.29]Kill me.
[189:20.31]So, is there a special, uh... I wonder where that special... Where's the... Let's go to, like, open the... Let's go over here.
[189:26.48]Alright.
[189:28.46]We have a couple more.
[189:29.82]We have River City Rancid.
[189:32.64]Beat the game.
[189:33.96]Beat the game with 50 plus rings.
[189:35.38]Beat the game without continuing.
[189:36.84]Beat the game with 100 rings.
[189:40.19]River City Rancid.
[189:50.91]This music is... I don't know.
[189:57.62]Play something else, the anger is going to kill me.
[189:59.50]No, I'm just going to lose some hair.
[190:00.64]It's going to be fine.
[190:01.22]I'm going to go in the shower today.
[190:09.43]After the stream, I'm gonna wash my body.
[190:12.61]I'm gonna put some body wash on.
[190:13.87]It's gonna feel nice.
[190:16.46]I'm gonna run my hands through my hair with shampoo and I'm gonna pull out like clumps of fucking hair.
[190:22.15]For all the anger.
[190:23.87]And all the stress.
[190:36.31]God damn it.
[190:37.25]And I didn't even get the rings.
[190:39.29]I didn't even get the rings that I was going up there to get.
[190:41.85]I'm ripping out clumps of hair tonight, boys and girls.
[190:57.38]I can't.
[190:58.23]I'm toast.
[191:02.39]I'm toast.
[191:02.71]I want to see the other cards.
[191:03.65]I'm toast.
[191:04.35]Just damn it.
[191:04.85]Rubble Bobble.
[191:08.56]Jeremiah, I'm right here.
[191:10.20]No, I'm bread.
[191:20.49]I don't even need to jump.
[191:27.75]That just shot me in the ear.
[191:31.23]You see that?
[191:41.33]on that one.
[191:49.07]You suck at this.
[191:51.31]Well, listen, hey, come on, give me a break here.
[191:53.99]Your name is Crappy Gamer.
[191:57.29]That means you probably aren't good at it either.
[191:59.22]Come on, man.
[192:02.34]No, uh, honest to God, I'm, uh, I'm just burnt.
[192:08.64]I've burnt it out.
[192:12.34]My body's burnt.
[192:13.24]The stream started so long ago.
[192:19.23]No, not really.
[192:19.91]It's been like three and a half hours or so.
[192:23.49]Name and shame.
[192:26.43]Why, Trevor, why?
[192:27.71]I'm just kidding.
[192:28.53]It was a joke.
[192:30.85]Why?
[192:31.27]Hey, look at what you made fun of me.
[192:34.18]That's not fair.
[192:34.92]I have feelings too.
[192:38.12]You said I suck.
[192:42.02]I'm just trying to compensate for how terrible I'm doing, okay?
[192:49.09]I might as well go buy a fucking Porsche.
[192:52.37]I'm driving around town.
[192:53.49]I have lost a lot of lives.
[193:02.07]None of my innocent!
[193:03.86]Innocent, excuse me, none of us are innocent here.
[193:09.04]You don't have feelings.
[193:11.26]None of us are innocent.
[193:14.86]Streamer harasses his viewers.
[193:19.35]Hehe, this music is funny because it's Russian.
[193:24.99]Alright, I gotta get out of this for a minute.
[193:29.57]This is cool, though.
[193:34.81]Oh, that's one of the pieces of the... That's one of the three... That's one of the three Amigos.
[193:41.08]See, you have Cat, Face, and Pac-Man.
[193:45.98]With three Amigo.
[193:52.50]Streamer insults all of his fans at once.
[193:54.52]Loses subscribers and hair in a single day.
[194:03.57]What about here?
[194:04.67]Nope.
[194:07.95]We're gonna beat it.
[194:11.16]No.
[194:13.72]Oh, whoops.
[194:16.84]I see the appeal.
[194:18.49]I was a big Meat Boy fan.
[194:21.09]I do wish.
[194:21.65]I mean, it is very similar.
[194:24.29]It is Meat Boy.
[194:25.25]It's just Meat Boy.
[194:26.43]We're playing Super Meat Boy with a DLC character.
[194:31.78]This is like DLC with a new character like fucking Frumpo or something.
[194:40.47]How far into the game am I?
[194:41.67]I am exactly, uh, like... 32%?
[194:47.82]So... I don't know.
[194:50.30]Half?
[194:52.94]Halfway?
[194:55.12]If you don't 100% the game, you just beat it.
[194:57.18]I don't know, I'm just exploring.
[195:00.12]I used to be a meat boy.
[195:08.82]32% equals half.
[195:10.50]Well, yes, it does.
[195:11.76]Because we're not talking about... We're talking about, like, beating the game.
[195:18.64]You guys know what I'm talking about.
[195:19.74]Don't make me seem like I'm fucking dummy.
[195:24.59]32% actually means, like, 40 or 50%.
[195:28.35]Because, like, I'm talking about, like, just completion of the game.
[195:33.43]Not getting all the stuff, not getting all the tumors...
[195:42.72]I just wanna go open a door, and then I can turn off the screen.
[195:45.58]Just wait till I plug in that SEGA CD, man.
[195:50.76]It's gonna be fucking insanity.
[195:55.46]I can't wait to play, like, Night Trap and Wirehead and... There's, like, a bunch of these games that are gonna be so much fun.
[196:05.41]I'm... No, I'm not a completionist.
[196:08.89]The only game that I was a completionist in was Grand Theft Auto 5.
[196:12.67]Because that's obviously one of the greatest games ever made.
[196:14.89]It just is.
[196:18.30]I just had to.
[196:18.98]I had to play the hell out of that game.
[196:22.14]But besides GTA 5, I don't know.
[196:24.78]I don't really... I don't really 100% remember the game.
[196:29.75]I got that one.
[196:30.41]Wow.
[196:30.85]Nice job, dude.
[196:39.61]Except I don't think I can continue.
[196:43.42]I can't.
[196:44.92]Yes, I can.
[196:48.62]101.
[196:49.38]Hey, guys.
[196:49.88]Let me show you fucking Meat Boy 101.
[197:00.03]It's that easy.
[197:01.19]Alright, should I open this?
[197:05.69]Should I open this?
[197:07.41]Wherever this takes me.
[197:08.03]This is in the first world.
[197:11.40]Streamer has no taste in plot or dialogue.
[197:13.90]What?
[197:18.95]No.
[197:19.19]Yes.
[197:19.49]No.
[197:19.71]No.
[197:19.91]No.
[197:20.09]Do it.
[197:20.31]Do it.
[197:20.51]Do it.
[197:20.71]No.
[197:22.95]Why not?
[197:24.03]Why not?
[197:24.71]Open it.
[197:28.25]I opened it.
[197:29.99]Watch these skills.
[197:30.91]First try.
[197:31.39]Guaranteed.
[197:31.85]I swear to God.
[197:32.61]Guaranteed.
[197:40.95]Fuck, I guaranteed it.
[197:44.13]I guaranteed that too.
[197:45.17]They liked it.
[197:45.71]Fuck, that was a guarantee.
[197:51.50]Oh, I'm so pissed.
[197:52.44]I guaranteed it.
[197:57.66]And now I can't even get past the first fucking slimes.
[198:12.64]First try.
[198:13.10]Guaranteed.
[198:13.50]Got the key.
[198:14.94]Got a new key.
[198:15.42]That's all it takes.
[198:16.80]And five boogers.
[198:20.01]And five boogers.
[198:22.99]Definitely was worth opening this one.
[198:25.35]I'll tell ya.
[198:41.74]It's very, very... That's gonna be weird.
[198:43.90]I have to, like, get right on the ledge.
[198:54.04]Alright, well... That was fun.
[198:59.57]How the... In mother's milk am I supposed to get over there?
[199:05.17]Well, let's just get the key and leave.
[199:10.21]New key.
[199:13.22]What is this streamer doing?
[199:15.70]Pipe?
[199:17.43]Pipe doesn't do anything.
[199:18.85]First try.
[199:19.23]Guaranteed.
[199:33.60]Alright, guys.
[199:34.20]I, uh... I'm gonna... I need to get some good sleep.
[199:39.92]My sleep's been all over the place lately.
[199:46.69]Have I gone for at least three hours tonight like just under three and a half, okay?
[199:53.85]So listen important important important Stay I'm not streaming tomorrow But go check out the Vinesauce charity stream My
[200:12.27]I would just go support it.
[200:13.19]It's a good cause.
[200:16.13]And watch tomorrow.
[200:17.57]Watch tomorrow night.
[200:19.23]I'll make a tweet.
[200:20.31]I'll probably be on there.
[200:22.85]With the Vinesauce people.
[200:26.04]All good people.
[200:28.82]So yeah.
[200:29.96]The next time I will be live on this channel...
[200:33.43]we will be doing.
[200:34.39]I have a lot of things I could potentially do.
[200:38.31]I got a list.
[200:39.69]A very long list.
[200:41.33]So it really just comes down to what I feel like doing on Tuesday.
[200:44.49]So, tomorrow night.
[200:45.64]See you guys tomorrow night.
[200:47.52]Not on this stream, obviously, but I'll see you guys on Tuesday here.
[200:53.68]Much love.
[200:54.90]Have a good rest of your weekend if I don't see you or hear from you.
[200:59.23]And I'll see you guys later.
[201:01.01]Have a good night.
[201:02.58]Take care, everybody.
[201:05.42]And before I go, thank you, Boneless Bacon, for the $5.
[201:09.36]Just think about the hippos going 354 miles per hour and you'll feel better.
[201:14.38]Kappa.
[201:15.72]You gotta put a Kappa on the end of that one.
[201:17.85]Elder Fruit, bless the families.
[201:19.89]Thanks a lot as well.
[201:22.33]Boneless Bacon gave $10, actually.
[201:25.41]How's the game so far thinking of picking it up?
[201:28.09]How much is this game?
[201:29.53]I need to see.
[201:32.49]Let me take a look.
[201:33.09]Let me take a look.
[201:39.85]Let me tell you.
[201:40.79]Yes, it is worth it.
[201:41.47]Yes.
[201:41.93]You should get it.
[201:43.01]Well, let's put it this way.
[201:44.45]Were you a fan of Super Meat Boy?
[201:49.24]Because it's literally Super Meat Boy.
[201:52.66]It's Super Meat Boy without the wall jump.
[201:55.74]And it's slowed down by about 30%, 40%.
[202:01.62]If that's something that you think you might be into, there's a lot of secrets.
[202:04.11]Obviously, there's a lot of places to explore, a lot of things to see.
[202:07.27]And it's a very challenging, extremely hard game.
[202:12.03]Then I'd say, yeah, I would recommend... Why can I not talk tonight?
[202:17.11]I would highly recommend it.
[202:23.13]And it is much harder.
[202:24.23]It actually is.
[202:24.99]It does feel a little bit harder than Meat Boy.
[202:28.77]Exquamely.
[202:32.90]You enjoyed Super Meat Boy, so I probably will.
[202:34.88]Yeah.
[202:36.28]Give it a go.
[202:38.84]Good night, everybody.
[202:40.20]See you on Tuesday.
[203:04.08]you
