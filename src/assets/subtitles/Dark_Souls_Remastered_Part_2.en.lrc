[ve:60.16.100]

[00:06.53]This is what's going to have to happen.
[00:09.99]It works.
[00:10.69]Hi, guys.
[00:18.98]Yep.
[00:21.64]Yeah.
[00:24.10]Mm-hmm.
[00:29.51]Yeah.
[00:32.17]Hey, remember this guy?
[00:36.06]Doesn't he look cool?
[00:37.18]Alright, so, hey, let's just, let's start with, like, let's, I'm not happy right now, so I'm just going, like, doing one thing.
[00:46.50]Let me just, like, turn down, like, the sound effects for just a second.
[00:53.78]Um... There's always something.
[01:00.66]What would I not understand?
[01:02.88]There's a couple things I don't understand.
[01:05.93]The thing I don't understand, number one.
[01:11.01]Get away from me!
[01:13.53]Get away from me, please!
[01:15.93]I don't wanna... Leave me alone!
[01:35.81]So, essentially what I'm trying to say here is... Why wouldn't they make two versions of Windows?
[01:48.63]You know what I'm saying?
[01:49.33]Like, why wouldn't you have?
[01:51.19]Go ahead, have like the stupid Windows 10 for the people that want to upload their fucking birthday party pictures to the cloud.
[01:59.52]Sure, go ahead.
[02:00.44]They can take all this dumb bloated dog shit.
[02:02.94]But why is there not like a Windows Pro?
[02:06.23]And Windows Professional was always just more bloated shit.
[02:10.31]They had that before.
[02:11.77]Why not have, like, two separate shells, you know what I mean?
[02:14.23]Have, like, the Windows 10 for grandma and her fucking iPhone pictures and have the Windows Pro for people that don't want all that shit.
[02:21.42]Just give us the small security updates that we need so we don't get our fucking computers hacked.
[02:27.36]It's called Windows 7.
[02:28.38]Yeah, but they're, like, they're disabling support for Windows 7 in, like, a year and a half.
[02:37.35]I was on Windows 7 until about a year and a half ago.
[02:41.65]Because they're not supporting it.
[02:43.29]2020 is it, and it's done.
[02:49.23]Ugh, anyways.
[02:55.06]I just wish there were more than one.
[02:57.46]But, so...
[03:00.29]Let me take a deep breath here.
[03:02.31]We left off at the Capra Demon.
[03:04.11]I'm already upset.
[03:05.14]I'm gonna need to shake these cobwebs off because this is an hour late now when I've been sitting here.
[03:12.40]And yes, if you're curious, just the people that are curious, I disabled do not ever tell me there's an update.
[03:18.98]I just did it.
[03:19.82]I said, leave me the fuck alone.
[03:21.48]Don't tell me this ever.
[03:22.56]Go fuck yourself.
[03:23.56]Every option that said that, I clicked it.
[03:25.83]And you just saw it on screen.
[03:28.65]They don't give a shit.
[03:31.51]It resets itself.
[03:32.79]It, like, fucking breaks itself and redoes it.
[03:36.17]Every... It's stuck at the same time.
[03:38.05]I can't even change the time.
[03:39.40]It's, like, 8.41 PM.
[03:41.68]I can't even change that time for when I want Windows to update.
[03:48.04]But, alright.
[03:49.20]Okay, I've complained.
[03:50.70]We've had our fucking tantrum for the day.
[03:54.66]Let's go to the Capra Demon.
[03:57.80]So we need to go from here...
[04:00.51]Up into the bonfire in Undeadburg.
[04:02.45]And go through the door.
[04:03.35]And then here we go.
[04:04.99]Dark Souls Remastered.
[04:10.82]If it updates during a boss fight... I'm gonna need a new computer.
[04:14.83]Because I'm gonna... Because I'm going to...
[04:22.65]I'm just not here.
[04:23.90]I'm not even here right now.
[04:25.32]I'm so distant.
[04:26.50]I'm so fucking full of angry juice.
[04:29.90]I can't... This is not gonna go well, and I'm telling you right now, I am not happy.
[04:36.15]I'm already on edge.
[04:37.41]I'm already... I've... No, man.
[04:45.60]I'm not paying attention.
[04:47.52]I'm lost right now.
[04:49.50]And you can't be lost when you play this game.
[04:51.08]You've got to be completely and totally fine.
[04:53.20]You've got to be into it.
[04:53.89]You've got to be ready.
[04:57.19]An hour of sitting there trying to disable Windows Update.
[05:00.13]And I can't even capture my goddamn computer screen.
[05:04.01]And here's another great thing that I can complain about.
[05:08.14]Because I'm doing monitor capture...
[05:12.62]My frames are lagging.
[05:14.13]So this is going to be even fucking worse.
[05:15.91]I hold desktop capture.
[05:21.67]I'm going to start dropping frames.
[05:23.27]Like video lag.
[05:31.54]Oh, I hate computers.
[05:33.92]I hate them.
[05:37.79]It's not that bad.
[05:38.45]Not bad now, but it will be.
[05:41.65]I can already feel it.
[05:42.75]Turning corners.
[05:43.47]Oh, wait.
[05:54.66]Didn't I get... Yeah, I got like a... I got a skip for this, didn't... God damn it.
[05:58.56]I can... You feel that?
[06:00.50]Did you feel that one?
[06:01.52]You feel these?
[06:02.10]Because I do.
[06:03.38]Wasn't doing this yet.
[06:04.36]Mm-hmm.
[06:12.87]Just update windows?
[06:13.73]I can't.
[06:16.17]Apparently my windows is bricked where I physically cannot update it.
[06:19.74]There's some kind of fucked up problem.
[06:23.88]There's a problem where it won't update.
[06:26.00]It doesn't matter how much I try.
[06:27.02]It doesn't matter what I do.
[06:28.63]This update will not go through.
[06:30.87]No matter what happens.
[06:35.87]Alright, where the fuck was I even going?
[06:37.45]Disab- doesn't matter.
[06:39.51]I could speak until my face is blue, but literally I've tried every single option.
[06:44.08]The only other option is I have to reset the whole computer.
[06:47.84]Like, do a fresh factory install is what they recommend if you have this problem with this update that they did in April.
[06:56.03]After this stream is over, I'm gonna have to recover my entire computer.
[07:01.25]Where am I going?
[07:01.87]I don't know.
[07:02.21]I have no idea.
[07:04.25]I should really just not stream.
[07:05.91]I'm going to be real.
[07:10.21]I'm going to be as real as I can.
[07:11.59]Total transparency here.
[07:13.45]I'm so fucking pissed off from this.
[07:15.99]I don't know if I can recover my own operating system right now.
[07:21.22]My own operating system is not recoverable.
[07:25.90]They bricked me with this latest bullshit here.
[07:33.46]play something more relaxing.
[07:34.64]That's the thing.
[07:35.72]I want to play this.
[07:40.19]I can feel that one.
[07:43.61]And it's so fucking wildly infuriating that between two days that my whole computer breaks because I downloaded one of the corrupted, fucked up Windows updates.
[07:55.57]Oh yeah, apparently a dickload of people are having problems with this.
[07:58.87]It fucking bricked a bunch of people's computers.
[08:01.19]You know, but whatever.
[08:01.87]You'll figure it out.
[08:02.61]Just reset your whole computer.
[08:05.01]And they wonder why people disable the updates.
[08:08.37]For the love of fucking God.
[08:09.57]Alright, where was I going?
[08:16.53]I gotta like memorize.
[08:17.37]I gotta get with it.
[08:18.03]No, it's not this way.
[08:21.81]Do yoga.
[08:22.49]I should really just do fucking yoga on stream.
[08:27.17]Especially considering that I actually can't... I'm gonna be... I'm gonna freak out.
[08:31.03]And I'll tell you... Hold on.
[08:33.79]You guys are gonna get a real freak out.
[08:35.17]Because I'm gonna... I'm lagging.
[08:37.59]Every like 12 to 15 seconds I can feel my computer like... Because I'm doing fucking monitor capture.
[08:44.42]That's gonna happen during a boss fight.
[08:45.70]And I'm gonna... Everything that I've been complaining about is gonna come to a boiling point.
[08:50.10]It's gonna be like A led to B, B led to C, C led to D, D led to Z. And I'm gonna fucking freak out.
[08:59.61]My computer's gonna hang a little bit on a dodge.
[09:02.19]And I'm gonna fucking scream.
[09:07.59]Let me just see where the shortcut goes so I can calm down.
[09:18.20]Oh my god, this is running like shit.
[09:24.16]Why?
[09:25.26]Why?
[09:26.48]Oh, I'm just gonna have like an offline computer that streams games.
[09:35.41]It was that way, wasn't it?
[09:40.91]You know what?
[09:41.33]You know what?
[09:41.73]You know what?
[09:42.39]You know what?
[09:42.69]I can already feel it.
[09:44.23]I ain't gonna lie to you guys.
[09:45.73]I ain't gonna do it.
[09:48.07]I'm not lying to you guys.
[09:48.89]I'm not going to lie to you guys.
[09:50.19]I'm not going to tell you bullshit.
[09:51.13]I'm not going to screw up.
[09:51.67]I'm not going to fucking pretend.
[09:53.33]I don't pretend.
[09:53.92]I can't.
[09:59.94]I was not going to stream tomorrow, but here's what's going to happen.
[10:02.78]If I can't get over it, we're just going to switch to something else.
[10:08.57]And I'm going to stream tomorrow.
[10:11.24]So, like, I will stream Dark Souls tomorrow.
[10:13.71]Because I'm just not in it right now.
[10:16.61]And I really want to fucking play this, but... Oh, man.
[10:21.67]I don't know if I can handle playing at 120 hertz, 60 FPS, going from... Like, be careful, don't turn a corner too tightly, because you'll drop down to, like, 30 or 40 frames a second.
[10:32.14]I don't know if I can do it.
[10:39.88]I didn't pick that up last time.
[10:43.72]And then, like, I will reset my whole computer to factory settings so I can get the April 2018 cumulative update from Windows.
[10:53.93]Did you know that you can upload extra pictures to the cloud?
[10:57.75]Don't you want this?
[11:01.43]We added a new Windows Movie Maker so you can share your vacation video.
[11:06.69]Where the fuck am I going?
[11:08.87]What's down here?
[11:10.29]Okay, I went the complete wrong way.
[11:12.69]I understand.
[11:18.36]So now I remember.
[11:19.16]It's through here and then you go that way.
[11:22.66]I just ran.
[11:23.40]I didn't need to go all this way.
[11:25.50]I didn't need to do this.
[11:26.36]I just had to run down the hall.
[11:29.82]The shortcut is open.
[11:33.08]I did this last time.
[11:36.35]So let's just go... Let me go get the ten flasks.
[11:44.73]Run back up here and we'll go the actual shortcut I was supposed to go through.
[11:51.72]It's alright, just give me the... No!
[11:53.52]No, wait, no, I... No, I fucking... I touched the bonfire.
[12:00.64]Oh, a fucking Windows goddamn PC gaming!
[12:07.31]Go this way!
[12:08.07]Just run this way!
[12:14.05]I was prepared.
[12:15.27]I was so ready.
[12:17.25]Like two hours ago, I was sitting there going, man, I can't wait.
[12:19.86]This is gonna be a lot of fun.
[12:20.68]I love Dark Souls.
[12:21.46]Dark Souls remastered.
[12:22.82]What a fucking great game this has been.
[12:24.12]It was a lot of fun last time.
[12:30.01]But I'm so on hyper tilt.
[12:35.73]I can't even say my fucking name.
[12:45.81]Breathe in breathe out and then you guys else get like this.
[12:49.17]I know I can't be the only one Right I can't be the only person that when Like when you I I don't know it's part of my personality.
[13:01.51]I have like a personality problem.
[13:03.09]Maybe I don't know But when shit goes wrong and like I'm not expecting it and I like I'm having a good day and it turns into like Oh, this is really annoying
[13:12.19]Oh, it takes like moving the goddamn Red Sea.
[13:16.49]What did Moses do, right?
[13:19.71]It's like parting the fucking Red Sea.
[13:24.89]And then I can't go swimming ever again.
[13:37.33]I have anger issues?
[13:38.27]I don't even have anger issues.
[13:39.49]I have like, I have Red Sea issues.
[13:44.22]Okay, just go down I can level up once Now, let me just like first try the capper demon so that I can like get over it No, no, no not not my period oh my god
[14:10.75]These disabled Windows updates?
[14:12.33]I did too.
[14:13.47]That's what I did.
[14:14.63]But even with all my, like, please notify me, updates, everything disabled, I started getting, like, two, three days ago, hey, you have to update, we have a feature, we need to update this.
[14:24.07]And I'm like, why am I getting this?
[14:25.07]I turn these off.
[14:26.45]So finally, after them annoying the fuck out of me for three days, I caved and I pressed the button.
[14:31.21]And now I can't capture video games anymore.
[14:33.81]And now I broke my Windows.
[14:38.96]I don't have enough.
[14:39.70]I might have enough, actually.
[14:43.53]Do I have enough after this?
[14:44.55]No, that's only going to be like... Nah, that won't be enough.
[14:47.57]Alright, let me go try to attack Mr. Capra Demon.
[14:59.55]Maybe by extreme irritation we'll be able to fight through the Capra Demon.
[15:16.89]Bye-bye.
[15:19.59]Bye-bye.
[15:22.73]Okay, it was this way.
[15:26.58]Told you in one or two days it was gonna... I know, that's the thing.
[15:30.54]But it was gonna happen inevitably.
[15:34.54]It was just gonna happen.
[15:39.65]That's why I brought it up before.
[15:43.50]I wish I could just... Hey, Windows.
[15:47.07]I'm one of those people that doesn't give a shit about your terrible features you want to put in.
[15:52.55]If people think they're cool, that's fine.
[15:54.37]I don't think they're cool at all.
[15:56.87]In fact, I hate the fact that you do.
[15:59.51]So can you just make a thing where you only give me... I check a box.
[16:04.72]Please?
[16:05.64]God damn it!
[16:07.88]Only give me cumulative, cumulative security updates.
[16:12.85]I don't want anything else.
[16:17.21]Okay, capper demon first try.
[16:21.41]Here we go.
[16:28.42]Let's see.
[16:29.08]Do I have it in me?
[16:29.72]I don't know.
[16:30.20]Probably not.
[16:31.50]Let's put our expectations high.
[16:35.80]Or low, for that matter.
[16:39.64]Yeah, I'm dead.
[16:43.48]I just need to get, like, past him.
[16:44.92]I gotta, like, run through him.
[16:46.01]I'll probably just run by him.
[17:03.10]UGH!
[17:04.76]You guys can feel that, right?
[17:05.89]You see this and feel it.
[17:06.81]You can see it.
[17:07.29]Look at this shit.
[17:12.43]Why?
[17:12.85]I can feel it.
[17:28.82]I'm talking about the frame rate.
[17:31.54]You can't take me.
[17:32.42]This is why I got the remaster in the first place.
[17:48.82]Here's like the sad part about this, Phil Spencer.
[17:52.34]I should have got this on PS4.
[17:55.54]Think about that.
[17:56.04]Oh my god, please.
[18:10.10]Like, is that sad for me to say that I should have bought this on PS4?
[18:15.30]This is supposed to be the platform, right?
[18:21.03]God, I'm gonna, like, die here.
[18:29.91]I was so excited for this.
[18:53.82]Alright, so I'm just going to try to run to the right.
[18:57.98]Around I didn't dodge through that?
[19:05.21]Strange.
[19:12.84]Whoa, what?
[19:15.40]Oh, come on.
[19:16.70]Alright, I think...
[19:26.40]Might need a smaller weapon than this.
[19:28.62]We have a dog.
[19:32.54]Okay, dog's dead.
[19:45.68]Wait, what?
[19:51.36]Where is he?
[19:51.88]Come up here?
[19:55.50]Nope, I fucked that up.
[20:03.62]Round and round we go.
[20:06.96]Come on,, come on around.
[20:21.85]Come chase me.
[20:29.83]Do it again.
[20:31.15]Around the merry-go-round.
[20:37.43]Cheese him?
[20:39.67]Well, you mean strategize against him, is that what you're saying?
[20:50.82]You mean beat the boss reliably because it's in the game and it's intended.
[20:55.93]Whoa!
[20:56.17]I'm okay.
[21:05.26]Oops, that was the wrong way.
[21:06.28]Boy!
[21:43.41]So anyways, why would they not have a fucking Windows Pro, okay?
[21:56.24]Do Do I feel better?
[21:56.94]No, I don't.
[21:59.59]I don't like how framey this is.
[22:00.67]It's very framey and I don't like it.
[22:07.98]They have a pro.
[22:08.90]No, but the pro is not the pro that I, I'm speaking of.
[22:11.82]I want a pro that removes every feature, except for the core shell of Windows 10.
[22:19.67]Everything.
[22:19.99]Okay, I have the key to the depths now.
[22:22.71]Which, was that down here?
[22:28.80]It's fucking framey and shit.
[22:40.93]Was it down this way?
[22:41.95]I don't know.
[22:44.05]Everybody wants one of thoses.
[22:45.12]There it is.
[22:48.12]Maybe I should... I don't know if I'm going to do this just yet.
[22:54.18]I'm going to go back up.
[22:55.08]I don't want to go to the bonfire.
[23:01.34]I really should use the humanities too, shouldn't I?
[23:08.02]They would still update that version.
[23:09.84]Well, I'm not, here's the thing, I'm not against updates to Windows.
[23:13.04]I'm not.
[23:13.60]I'm just against all the new, huge feature patches that they put in that nobody asked for.
[23:21.37]That's a thing that a lot of these companies are deciding to do these days.
[23:26.51]I don't understand it.
[23:28.41]It doesn't matter if it's Microsoft, if it's YouTube, if it's Twitter, Twi- it doesn't matter.
[23:34.79]Adding a bunch of shit that nobody ever wanted in the first place.
[23:39.33]Going the wrong way.
[23:42.87]How do Twitch Prime subs help me directly?
[23:44.69]They're the same thing as a regular sub.
[23:46.02]It's just a sub.
[23:47.92]It's just a Twitch sub.
[23:50.48]It's very, very, very helpful.
[23:56.60]Little Timmy asked for it.
[23:59.92]No, I don't think anybody did.
[24:01.74]I think what happens is a lot of these guys get around and they talk about all the shit that they think would be cool.
[24:08.80]They sit around at like a company meeting and they- there's like eight people in this room by the way.
[24:14.10]Here's what I think would be cool.
[24:19.58]So all these random fucking feature upgrades are from potentially like nine people that thought it was cool.
[24:30.26]Nobody asked that, so he just wants us to sub with Prime.
[24:32.86]You can do whatever you want.
[24:37.76]You don't have to sub to me if you don't want to.
[24:41.04]You can do whatever you please.
[24:42.42]Oh, because you're still here.
[25:00.57]Reverse psychology.
[25:03.19]No, you can do... I don't care if you sub to me or you sub to... fucking Microsoft.
[25:09.60]Alright, what do we got?
[25:11.86]We need more Endurance.
[25:15.32]I think that's alright looking.
[25:22.09]Now, can I... Kindling the Flame.
[25:25.27]I haven't done that anywhere, and that gives you more Estus Flasks, right?
[25:29.03]I should probably do that to places I have trouble in, huh?
[25:34.34]Okay, so now we can go down back to the depths.
[25:38.10]Which is, we're getting to the point where I stop playing.
[25:41.46]Up here, in like the next area or two.
[26:10.67]I've only died at this ledge.
[26:14.71]I haven't died anywhere else.
[26:16.85]I died once to the capper demon.
[26:18.61]This is like harder than the fucking boss.
[26:22.05]I just gotta get up there.
[26:28.26]It's this one guy on the top there that blows it every time.
[26:31.46]I just have to kill this guy.
[26:33.90]Just kill this dude.
[26:35.53]Alright, he just will do that.
[26:36.59]Just collect the green souls and get out of here.
[26:43.71]Okay.
[26:45.53]Starting to... I'm starting to light up a little bit here.
[26:50.05]If my mood was dark blue, it's now getting into, like, the green area.
[26:54.27]You know, like, the turquoise-y blue on the mood ring?
[26:58.33]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[26:59.19]I'm sorry.
[26:59.59]I'll reverse that.
[27:00.75]Switch it around and spin it around and then reverse it again.
[27:04.27]I was like burning red and now I'm like turning into like an orange.
[27:12.18]You guys remember the mood rings if you touched it?
[27:14.66]I told you how angry or sad or happy you were.
[27:18.10]It just was how hot your hand was.
[27:21.37]You guys don't know what I'm talking about.
[27:24.79]All right, here we go.
[27:25.23]New area.
[27:26.89]The depths.
[27:28.59]I know it's the depths because that was the key to the depths.
[27:30.71]And stop frame rating on me.
[27:32.53]Okay.
[27:43.96]Let's turn around here.
[27:45.12]Uh-huh.
[27:48.12]What you got on me?
[27:49.26]Nothing.
[27:52.21]Just some chumps.
[27:53.21]You had a mood necklace a long time ago?
[27:54.68]Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[27:57.40]Those things that told you how sad you were.
[27:58.90]Alright, looking for a bonfire down here.
[28:11.83]Once we get a bonfire, we're good to go.
[28:24.12]yeah I was that's the difference between capturing with um game capture versus like monitor capture instead of hooking through directx which is what game capture does and you don't get a lot of performance loss you suck all you have to pull the whole every single inch of your monitor gets pulled in
[28:45.09]It's not going, like, hooking through DirectX as much as it is just... Look at the screen, and it uses more resources.
[28:51.80]So that's why you're noticing probably... And I am too, very much so.
[28:56.38]Random, like, 40 frames per second kind of drops here.
[29:00.51]Alright.
[29:05.71]We got the butcher down there.
[29:16.51]He's actually running over here.
[29:20.05]All right, let's fight Mr. Butcher Man.
[29:25.05]Is he holding a wrench in his hand?
[29:27.43]Ooh, he's quick.
[29:34.01]Ooh, you are very quick, aren't you?
[29:35.41]Ooh, that's not good.
[29:45.22]I tried to parry his shit there.
[29:50.61]Damn it.
[30:03.64]Come here.
[30:08.28]Damn it!
[30:13.54]Oh, whatever.
[30:13.90]Just kill him.
[30:18.03]One more hit, and you're dead.
[30:28.57]Dude, one-handed R2.
[30:29.45]I need to parry.
[30:33.77]I'm just... I don't know, man.
[30:39.76]It's very easy for me to tell you exactly why I'm not happy right now.
[30:43.96]It's like all we've talked about for like 30 minutes.
[30:49.99]Oh, man.
[30:51.99]You know how you can title this stream?
[30:53.61]Just like, play on repeat.
[30:55.49]Me upset at hooking a DirectX game with the new Windows update.
[31:02.65]Ooh, there's a pot down there.
[31:03.59]Nothing else, right?
[31:08.65]Does it go down?
[31:09.27]It just dropped down there.
[31:12.15]Is there a staircase over here?
[31:14.91]No.
[31:16.25]There's one over here.
[31:23.22]I don't think I want to fall in there.
[31:24.70]That looks like acid water.
[31:29.88]I'm going to touch this and the walls are going to break down and people are going to run at me or something, right?
[31:32.88]Oh, there's something in there?
[31:36.25]Oh, come on.
[31:37.89]They're very clear.
[31:38.39]It looks like there's something inside of here.
[31:39.59]Is that it?
[31:48.50]Whoa.
[31:49.18]Be careful.
[31:49.62]Way down.
[31:54.36]Are you breathing?
[31:55.78]No.
[31:58.35]Large ember.
[31:59.17]Hey, I thought it was an Estus suit.
[32:08.43]Oh, shit.
[32:08.78]I do have to go down there.
[32:11.60]Wait a minute.
[32:11.94]What about something else over here?
[32:16.30]Can I go down there?
[32:19.16]There's a place to drop here.
[32:28.98]Yeah.
[32:30.12]Okay.
[32:35.32]And there he is.
[32:35.90]Whoa, he can't jump up here, can he?
[32:38.86]I don't remember.
[32:40.44]What does he do?
[32:42.60]He's just spelling me.
[32:43.62]Okay.
[32:45.43]Well, there's an item over there.
[32:47.61]It's a giant rat.
[32:56.03]Somebody quick, somebody play the song.
[33:00.60]Spider shield.
[33:01.20]I already have one of those.
[33:01.94]Let's head over there.
[33:06.19]Nice little throwback.
[33:16.79]Can I cheese him from here?
[33:21.72]I probably can.
[33:25.18]Just checking for walls.
[33:26.68]You never know when there could be an illusion.
[33:32.98]Illusion?
[33:34.18]No.
[33:35.68]Well, there's... Are there any other rats down there?
[33:49.99]Okay, I don't see any other rats.
[33:51.59]We're going to go for it right in the head.
[33:56.86]Well, that was very easy.
[33:58.08]He's dead.
[34:00.80]I kind of feel bad that that was that easy.
[34:04.30]They had a humanity on.
[34:05.20]Okay.
[34:05.72]Well.
[34:07.94]Bye.
[34:09.92]Sewer chamber key.
[34:12.92]Choose these guys too because they're going to be a problem soon.
[34:14.74]Come over here.
[34:17.42]I know you guys are going to be a problem.
[34:19.85]Oh well.
[34:22.31]More sludge.
[34:31.96]I killed that?
[34:32.36]That was a friendly NPC?
[34:33.70]No, it wasn't.
[34:34.90]That was not a friendly NPC.
[34:36.32]Alright, anything else I can do down here?
[34:44.29]Any doors?
[34:44.83]Any rooms?
[34:46.89]I can go further down into the waterfall, but I don't know if I want to do that yet.
[34:55.47]I can ride him.
[35:01.96]Alright, now you got little corridors here, and I don't like it, so... Something else?
[35:09.84]He's running away.
[35:10.54]They always run away when they're trying to trap you and bait you into somebody else.
[35:15.69]Who are you trying to bait me into?
[35:16.87]Is what I don't understand.
[35:19.51]Where are you going?
[35:20.53]No.
[35:21.21]He's got nowhere to go.
[35:21.83]Okay.
[35:24.45]So what was the... Okay, his friend is right there.
[35:26.49]Good thing I have an overhead swing.
[35:35.73]Always look both ways before crossing the street.
[35:37.39]That's what I say.
[35:39.61]Okay, good.
[35:45.21]See?
[35:45.61]I told you.
[35:46.15]Always look both ways.
[35:46.91]You don't know when a fucking rat car will come and hit you.
[35:53.18]I'm gonna go this way first.
[35:57.84]Is that a hole?
[36:00.34]I think that's a hole.
[36:00.96]Alright, I feel you, game.
[36:05.04]He's not gonna fuck with me.
[36:17.46]Hold on, I'm just gonna walk slowly down this hall.
[36:22.36]Holding up my little pretend shield and we got ourselves a soul of an able soldier.
[36:27.30]Okay.
[36:29.92]Okay, this is a boss room?
[36:33.86]Or maybe not.
[36:34.38]I don't know.
[36:34.78]I'm not sure yet.
[36:35.38]I'm not going to do it yet.
[36:36.36]I need a bonfire.
[36:50.58]Bad news if they all come at the same time.
[36:54.62]Surprise!
[36:58.02]I knew they were going to be a problem.
[36:59.04]That's why I wanted to kill them first.
[37:00.20]But, now what?
[37:01.26]Am I at a dead end here?
[37:05.52]Oh, no.
[37:05.88]This is staircase.
[37:06.44]Okay.
[37:14.81]He's running that way.
[37:15.57]Nothing that way.
[37:16.13]Got to keep going around.
[37:19.11]Well, your friend took a bullet for you, and you're still dead.
[37:24.32]Humanity, that's good.
[37:26.32]I'm going to top myself off here.
[37:37.41]Bleeding walls.
[37:38.80]The ooze walls.
[37:41.97]Oh boy, OK, here we go.
[37:43.53]One hit.
[37:44.09]Gotta get them all.
[37:47.03]Got it.
[37:48.25]So proud of myself.
[37:50.27]Great axe.
[37:51.15]That is definitely a giant strength weapon.
[37:56.38]Maybe I should take a look at it.
[38:01.26]Although.
[38:01.60]Let me see what it does.
[38:04.46]Great axe.
[38:08.62]Alright, do we have a display here?
[38:11.99]Where is it?
[38:13.55]Greataxe.
[38:14.05]140 plus 75.
[38:14.57]150 plus 79.
[38:14.89]And this is plus 2.
[38:16.01]This is nothing.
[38:18.97]32 strength to wield it effectively.
[38:21.35]That thing's pretty ridiculous, though.
[38:25.23]Not even plus 1.
[38:25.81]I'm going to hold on to this thing.
[38:30.66]14 weight versus 10.
[38:31.40]It's a little heavier.
[38:36.78]Let's see.
[38:37.52]It's going to hold it.
[38:41.60]Oh, man.
[38:43.22]This thing is beefy, huh?
[38:50.33]Well, for now, we'll keep the Zwayander on.
[38:58.46]Zway, Zway, Zway, Zwayander.
[39:03.96]So, now what the hell do I... I gotta go back and walk around.
[39:06.08]Oh, here we go.
[39:06.76]There's a spot here.
[39:16.52]Guy up here.
[39:20.52]I really missed that.
[39:21.52]What the fuck am I targeting?
[39:28.39]Good thing that happened Glad that happened sewer chamber key and there's a bonfire beautiful.
[39:36.06]Okay, so fuck that We are going to get the bonfire Hey So I'm going to can I Kindle this oh
[39:56.26]So it would be a smart idea if I were to kindle this and get 10 Estus, right?
[40:02.34]I have a lot of humanity.
[40:03.18]Might as well start to use it.
[40:04.06]I'm like... Why would I not use humanity and do it?
[40:19.16]Okay.
[40:20.50]Let's be human again.
[40:21.46]Let's kindle the bonfire.
[40:22.50]Wait, what?
[40:29.99]Oh, it's not like the other games.
[40:33.29]Oh.
[40:36.83]Okay.
[40:39.40]I thought it was, uh... I thought you could just take one, like in the other ones.
[40:49.39]Well, I don't know.
[40:50.27]When you take a humanity in the other games, it turns you into a...
[41:00.50]Okay, there we go.
[41:06.82]Well, now I'm a human.
[41:09.29]Used an extra humanity, like, I've kind of fucked that up.
[41:14.13]Am I still right to use it?
[41:17.45]I thought it takes two.
[41:19.99]Well, I don't think, I don't know if I want 15.
[41:21.89]I think that's a little, might be a little much.
[41:26.35]Invade him, invade him.
[41:27.30]Well, you can't invade me because I am currently playing in the offline mode.
[41:32.28]You cannot invade me.
[41:34.10]Not right now.
[41:36.94]Somebody told me that I should not do that because somebody might throw a hack ball at me and delete my character from the game.
[41:43.13]So I said, you know what?
[41:43.97]I'm just going to play through Dark Souls.
[41:49.94]We're just going to play Dark Souls.
[41:57.35]So I can go this way or I can go back down.
[41:58.75]And there was like a boss door.
[41:59.71]Let's just keep going this way and see what's around here.
[42:01.45]Wait, don't you dare fuck that up.
[42:03.21]Stay around the maze of these blobs.
[42:07.45]Okay.
[42:08.31]So what is down here?
[42:11.59]Nothing all the way that way.
[42:12.83]There's one of those monsters.
[42:17.90]Really?
[42:20.46]Okay, well good thing I got ten because I just used two right now on this fucking idiot.
[42:27.88]No one.
[42:31.78]No more sludge monsters?
[42:32.80]Doesn't look like it.
[42:40.38]Stop lagging!
[42:41.14]Okay, there we go.
[42:48.09]Oh, oh!
[42:50.97]I know what ring I have I need to put on.
[42:56.73]I have a ring I need to put on right now.
[43:01.89]These things take a thousand hits because they're sludged.
[43:04.11]Yeah, of course they do.
[43:18.00]Alright, so I need to put that ring on.
[43:21.88]Should I take off instead?
[43:22.90]I'm going to keep on Havel's Ring.
[43:24.40]Take this off temporarily.
[43:28.77]sound much better all right so no more slugs opened this door which leads to uh just kind of near the beginning I don't know looks like we're down where the butcher was
[43:58.14]Yeah, I would say so.
[44:00.01]I'd say that's pretty accurate.
[44:01.09]I thought that was it.
[44:04.43]Oh my god.
[44:10.32]I'm not even going to parry this guy.
[44:18.96]Just kill him.
[44:20.18]By the time I parry him, I could have just killed him in the first place.
[44:29.25]Come on, die.
[44:32.35]Yeah, so this is just a short sack.
[44:37.94]Return of the Parry King.
[44:39.88]I felt like I should have parried that first one.
[44:42.72]Well, there's more down here.
[44:44.88]What the fuck is this?
[44:45.70]Um, all right.
[45:00.00]More rats.
[45:04.00]Bad camera angles.
[45:11.23]Put sack on.
[45:12.65]Sack on head.
[45:16.55]This thing sucks.
[45:20.77]This thing's terrible.
[45:25.78]I really don't want to have this all.
[45:26.84]This is awful.
[45:27.54]This looks like shit.
[45:30.55]So what was the point of this?
[45:31.35]Is there somewhere else I can go down here?
[45:34.29]I guess I can go back up and through here.
[45:45.61]Oh.
[45:50.01]In the barrel?
[45:50.61]Oh, God.
[45:53.47]What if I blow this all up?
[45:55.31]Okay, no, it's not.
[45:56.67]Is it going to hurt him if I just roll through it?
[46:06.70]You're not going to attempt to do a job.
[46:07.96]I'm going to do the whole thing, you know.
[46:13.12]Is this guy going to attack me when I let him out?
[46:14.60]That would be funny.
[46:15.14]All right.
[46:19.76]Let him out.
[46:21.62]Is it a pyromancy guy or something?
[46:24.13]Thank you.
[46:39.62]You're very welcome.
[46:40.38]See you at Firelink.
[46:42.04]I wonder what you teach.
[46:46.66]Alright, well.
[46:50.63]I can't wait till there's a war at Firelink.
[46:55.40]kiss him.
[46:57.44]There is no option to kiss that guy.
[46:59.42]So, sorry to burst your bubble there, whoever was asking for that.
[47:07.64]Well, I'm just going to go back to the fog gate, I guess.
[47:12.23]Unless there was something else I missed around here.
[47:13.67]I don't think I did.
[47:14.29]Is it just a weird roundabout way to go underneath?
[47:19.35]To get that guy, I guess?
[47:20.47]I don't see any other reason to go that way.
[47:36.13]Okay.
[47:37.73]This way.
[47:38.49]This is the bonfire.
[47:41.79]Whoa!
[47:42.03]These things are alive!
[47:42.71]I forgot.
[47:43.15]Okay.
[47:43.39]How about if we just mud on the ground?
[47:50.30]We're down.
[47:51.94]I'm gonna just re-get, you know, get it again.
[47:55.28]There was another way I could have gone, I think.
[47:57.92]Hold on a second.
[48:00.81]Isn't there another way I could go?
[48:03.54]Back here.
[48:04.04]To the right.
[48:05.88]Down and then around.
[48:06.86]I'm pretty sure there's another way to go.
[48:15.80]Right.
[48:16.10]Yeah, right here.
[48:16.66]Okay.
[48:17.40]Yes.
[48:18.50]So there is.
[48:18.92]I'm going to go down here.
[48:29.02]Which is a door this way.
[48:30.76]Open it up.
[48:32.54]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[48:39.16]Oh, that's awkward.
[48:39.76]Oh well.
[48:47.32]That's probably a shortcut.
[48:48.38]Oh, not this way.
[48:54.34]Now, where was that boss door?
[48:59.27]I get... Yeah, hit the wall.
[49:09.43]Turn and swing at the wall, you fucking idiot.
[49:15.49]Is the giant rat back?
[49:16.87]He shouldn't, right?
[49:20.55]Um... Is there a door over here?
[49:28.20]Oh, no door.
[49:31.99]These guys drop humanity a lot.
[49:46.36]Now, if I remember, the boss of this place is... It's a dragon, right?
[49:59.98]Let's see.
[50:00.30]Looks like we're going to find out if this is even a boss door.
[50:12.43]It is not a boss door.
[50:15.13]Or is it?
[50:19.15]Okay, magician over there.
[50:20.23]What the hell are you doing?
[50:29.46]These fucking rats are bigger than the other ones.
[50:31.48]They're much bigger.
[50:34.05]Jesus Christ.
[50:40.95]That's it, right?
[50:41.39]All right.
[50:42.81]I'm starting to stockpile souls here.
[50:44.78]Nice swing.
[50:55.93]I always hate having enough to level up and not doing it.
[50:58.15]I can go this way or this way.
[51:00.81]Let's take a look around here.
[51:05.18]Uh-huh.
[51:08.42]Well, I could have guessed that was going to happen.
[51:18.73]Not in this one?
[51:19.67]Come on.
[51:20.47]How could... Why wouldn't they play it smarter than this?
[51:23.57]Why wouldn't one of them go in one of these large boxes?
[51:26.35]Okay, well that was the reason to come over here.
[51:33.09]Shipment of rats.
[51:36.39]Rat delivery service.
[51:37.59]I don't think I'm gonna make you paranoid and check every single one of these boxes.
[51:44.94]Wait, what else is over here?
[51:45.90]Anything?
[51:49.17]Ah, okay.
[51:52.31]I'm going to go this way first.
[51:55.76]Jesus Christ.
[51:56.54]Okay, we're going to stick to our guns here and go this way.
[52:00.36]That's a hole.
[52:10.64]Wait a minute.
[52:11.97]This is just back up here.
[52:15.79]Oh.
[52:16.53]This wraps around...
[52:25.27]So then now I go this way.
[52:32.44]I remember this part.
[52:33.22]Okay, so I probably had to go the other way then.
[52:36.04]Because there are two ways to go now.
[52:40.25]That's where the giant rat was.
[52:44.95]Whoa, that was close.
[52:47.75]That was close going down there.
[53:07.84]Okay, so I need to get like a... I need to see where we've been going.
[53:13.48]I could have wrapped around and gone the other way.
[53:16.84]This brings me back.
[53:17.92]It's just a circle and... I hate how every corridor... When you got every corridor is the same corridor, I get fucking confused.
[53:28.22]So I didn't go this way.
[53:31.74]Watch out for the hole.
[53:32.44]I should probably go down the hole.
[53:37.71]I'm gonna go down the hole.
[53:42.21]Let's go down the hole.
[53:43.63]We haven't been down there.
[53:47.95]New area!
[53:48.53]Okay, I was supposed to go down the hole.
[53:54.82]And there's these weird Muppets down here.
[53:56.54]Wow.
[53:57.42]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[54:04.74]I know what happens when that fills up, you die.
[54:07.55]I've played these games before.
[54:08.63]Fuck, okay, I gotta get rid of these dudes.
[54:12.89]There's so many of them.
[54:23.90]Okay, safe.
[54:32.35]Large soul... Why am I singing that?
[54:39.02]Up or down?
[54:39.50]I'm going to say let's go straight.
[54:44.64]Hmm.
[54:47.35]Well, that looks harder.
[54:52.89]Don't get sprayed.
[54:53.53]It's almost like they were waiting for me to go through the door.
[54:58.39]Just wait until the fucking fart bomb is gone.
[55:17.46]No, don't kick!
[55:18.56]Swing!
[55:19.24]Don't kick!
[55:22.50]Oh, they're everywhere.
[55:23.32]They're on everything.
[55:27.18]Eye of Death.
[55:28.00]What is that thing?
[55:28.76]Is that a spell?
[55:30.76]Ooh, item.
[55:35.67]Ring of the Evil Eye?
[55:42.61]What is that?
[55:46.12]Absorbs HP from fallen enemies, eh?
[55:51.48]And what is this thing that I just got?
[55:56.93]Is it under, like, spells or something?
[56:04.73]Lure phantoms from other worlds.
[56:08.76]Oh.
[56:12.28]Well.
[56:14.45]Kind of cool, I guess.
[56:16.08]Now we go up.
[56:20.12]And around.
[56:24.18]From the death side.
[56:28.72]It's a covenant item.
[56:30.43]Yeah, that's cool.
[56:32.41]Two ways.
[56:33.29]Left or right.
[56:35.83]Let's go right.
[56:36.53]Is there a person in here?
[56:48.88]You gotta be aggressive with these guys.
[56:50.08]You can't just let them spray around.
[56:51.20]Otherwise, you're gonna fucking inhale it and die.
[56:57.96]As I play like a coward.
[56:59.53]You gotta be aggressive with these guys.
[57:00.93]Make sure you're real aggressive.
[57:08.85]Hide!
[57:13.15]Nothing else, right?
[57:18.18]Item solve a nameless soldier That gets me around this Fucking goddamn mazes Someone's gonna pop out of one of these I know it one of those little skeleton men are gonna come out of there and explode There's the other hole
[57:54.92]Wait for him to come up the stairs.
[57:58.01]Whoa, that's getting close.
[58:00.47]Don't walk into it.
[58:04.69]Come on.
[58:06.47]Okay.
[58:10.42]I was so paranoid about falling into the holes, and I should have just fallen in.
[58:20.06]Smooth.
[58:21.08]Slowly but surely progressing this way.
[58:25.80]Brings me... I'm leaving like the Hansel and Gretel breadcrumb trails here.
[58:29.86]Because I'm destroying every single one of these stalagmites.
[58:35.14]So that means I haven't been here.
[58:36.20]That's how you know.
[58:44.88]If those things have been destroyed, it means I've been there.
[58:59.47]What?
[59:00.11]Who's coming in here?
[59:02.97]Wait, who the fuck is this?
[59:04.09]I'm on offline mode.
[59:08.84]What do you mean?
[59:09.64]Who the fuck is this?
[59:11.02]Oh, is this one of those stupid phantoms that just comes in?
[59:13.62]Get rid of the rat and then watch out.
[59:26.09]Get out of here, Captain Kirk.
[59:36.44]Let's do it again.
[59:39.42]One more hit.
[59:45.59]See you later.
[59:46.49]Don't invade somebody else's game, asshole.
[59:51.97]What'd I get for doing that?
[59:55.41]Retrieve remaining power of Dark Spirit.
[60:01.52]So what?
[60:05.35]He didn't even give you an item or anything.
[60:06.71]He just invades and gives you souls and that's it.
[60:11.90]I didn't get anything.
[60:16.62]I already had humanity.
[60:17.70]6,000 souls.
[60:21.68]Yeah, I wanted his shield or something.
[60:23.92]His funny spike shield.
[60:25.08]Alright, hold on.
[60:28.04]Hansel and Gretel, come on.
[60:28.82]Is that a hole?
[60:32.60]No.
[60:45.69]I'm starting to get lost again.
[60:46.73]I'm back where the waterfall was.
[60:51.37]This is where the giant rat was, wasn't it?
[60:53.59]Or is this a different place?
[60:54.39]I don't remember this.
[61:00.13]No, okay.
[61:00.83]This is not the same place.
[61:07.75]Oh, come on, you fucking asshole.
[61:09.48]There's a door right there.
[61:12.00]There's a giant door right there.
[61:13.86]There's probably a shortcut right here, too.
[61:16.76]Just play this smart.
[61:17.96]Don't be an idiot and die right here.
[61:23.94]Any more of those idiots?
[61:26.32]Idiots.
[61:28.89]I'm going to kill every single one of these.
[61:29.83]I don't care.
[61:30.11]I'm not missing a shortcut because of this.
[61:38.24]Is there a faster way to do this shit?
[61:42.48]With fire, probably, right?
[61:44.50]With lightning or something.
[61:51.05]I do have enough to level up like two or three times, so... I really do hope I get to a shortcut here.
[61:57.39]Firebomb.
[61:58.13]Yeah, but I mean, it's just so easy.
[62:00.22]Might as well just not even use the firebombs.
[62:10.50]Oh, there's... Okay, there's a door here.
[62:20.15]I'm holding down the block button in case, like, a fucking boulder comes through here.
[62:23.53]I know it's gonna possibly... No, this is the door that... Alright, cool.
[62:27.49]Yes, yes, yes.
[62:28.11]Awesome.
[62:28.65]Found it.
[62:29.97]This is the door leading up to here.
[62:32.30]Cool.
[62:32.48]Okay.
[62:32.92]And the bonfire's right here.
[62:39.66]Isn't it, like, right here?
[62:40.64]Yeah.
[62:44.26]Nice.
[62:44.60]Okay.
[62:45.20]Cool.
[62:48.95]So, let's get Endurance up.
[62:51.55]We can do two levels here.
[62:53.63]One of Endurance, one of Vitality.
[63:01.03]Sack is the best fashion.
[63:03.31]It's pretty good.
[63:05.84]It's decent fashion, I would say.
[63:10.88]Alright, go back and touch it again.
[63:13.00]Go back and touch it again.
[63:13.96]I'm not... That's... Come on.
[63:15.72]Seriously.
[63:17.12]I count that as a death.
[63:21.32]Use my souls?
[63:22.36]I can't.
[63:26.21]Just pretend I died there.
[63:32.65]What?
[63:35.63]Okay.
[63:36.55]Go.
[63:37.87]No, no, no, no, no.
[63:38.67]Don't... I want to open this door.
[63:40.03]He dropped something.
[63:41.97]Didn't he?
[63:42.37]No.
[63:42.77]Alright.
[63:43.05]Whatever.
[63:43.45]Don't play it like it's not Resident Evil.
[63:48.32]Use the souls I picked up?
[63:50.66]Did I... Is it enough?
[63:54.42]I'm always scared to use these because I feel like I'm not going to get there.
[63:56.50]Okay.
[63:57.08]Maybe I will.
[64:00.37]Yeah, I don't like using them unless I'm certain.
[64:02.31]Because otherwise you're just stuck with more souls that you shouldn't have used.
[64:07.22]How much is it to level up once?
[64:09.48]7,000, okay.
[64:14.56]How many should I... I need 1,000 more.
[64:16.40]Okay.
[64:18.53]Actually, you know what?
[64:20.27]Killing this one guy like two times in a row, I won't need to use one.
[64:24.67]Come here.
[64:30.17]Come here.
[64:30.41]What does he give us?
[64:34.95]60.
[64:35.03]Is that enough?
[64:35.83]Let's kill this one last guy just to be sure.
[64:42.79]Oh, by the way, my dog is still down here sleeping in his little bed.
[64:46.10]And you know that smelly dog smell?
[64:49.36]My dog is really tired and it fills the air with that heavy dog soup smell.
[64:54.96]It's all I can smell.
[64:56.58]It's in my nostrils right now.
[64:58.20]The only thing.
[65:01.05]He just made a noise, moved, and I got the dog stew in my nose.
[65:06.45]Um... Let's just do 22 of Vitality.
[65:10.68]Get beefy.
[65:23.17]Now we got the skip.
[65:24.11]Now we go down here.
[65:25.31]Perfect.
[65:28.89]Let's go.
[65:36.45]Oh, I love shortcuts.
[65:37.39]They make me so happy.
[65:38.93]I'm so glad I don't have to do that all again.
[65:43.71]Watch out for the slugs up here.
[65:44.95]Alright, I didn't really look around over here very much.
[65:46.81]There's a guy up there.
[65:51.47]Rat.
[65:53.61]Where's the other guy?
[65:54.19]I didn't know there was somebody else here.
[65:55.17]Alright, um, we can go straight through.
[66:07.52]This way.
[66:07.92]Let's go look.
[66:08.36]I want to look over here first.
[66:09.22]All right.
[66:11.21]NPC.
[66:13.67]Bunch of stuff I can break.
[66:15.31]Might as well.
[66:18.91]No, nothing.
[66:22.85]This goes to Blighttown, right?
[66:30.27]We are getting to the point where I stop playing.
[66:32.57]Okay.
[66:33.39]Gold pine resin.
[66:34.81]Bottomless box.
[66:36.09]Crystal straight sword.
[66:37.47]Crystal great sword.
[66:38.93]Ooh.
[66:39.35]Whoa!
[66:39.45]190 plus 91?! !
[67:02.77]That's huge.
[67:08.21]That's so much more than I have now.
[67:10.19]They can't be repaired.
[67:11.53]That's so much damage, though.
[67:14.98]That's so cool.
[67:16.98]Armor of the Glorious.
[67:18.56]Armor of the Wise.
[67:19.64]These are light.
[67:24.64]Can't afford any of these, though.
[67:26.02]Hmm.
[67:27.07]I'm afraid I don't see anything here.
[67:31.46]The gold pine resin is handy, so I'll come back to you later.
[67:35.86]Hopefully he stays here.
[67:40.86]Just buy a bunch of crystal weapons and then just steamroll the rest of the game.
[67:47.60]Maybe another time.
[67:49.50]I'm gonna go over here.
[67:53.36]The armor's good.
[67:54.00]Well, if I don't... I'm gonna get souls, maybe.
[67:58.79]Okay.
[68:01.37]Boss fight.
[68:02.49]Yep, yep, yep.
[68:06.34]Any items over here?
[68:08.56]No.
[68:10.38]Oh, you fucking idiot, really?
[68:11.52]Hmm.
[68:23.89]Hmm.
[68:27.43]It's time to fight Solaire.
[68:28.81]I don't even know who that is.
[68:34.98]But there's more over this way.
[68:36.28]I'm going to just check.
[68:37.10]I don't want to miss anything.
[68:42.26]That's not good.
[68:47.07]Do I need to keep this ring on?
[68:48.45]I mean, I see water.
[68:50.11]I'm scared of this water.
[68:51.03]I'm going to keep... No, I don't think I even need this ring.
[68:53.01]Might as well put on the defense one, right?
[69:01.99]Down we go.
[69:12.26]More to look.
[69:15.12]Check every nook and cranny.
[69:16.44]That's the name of the game.
[69:21.76]What is this?
[69:23.52]I'm not even online.
[69:26.02]Huh?
[69:26.24]Am I online?
[69:30.66]Why am I online right now?
[69:38.67]Heavy crossbow.
[69:42.07]Oh those are NPCs.
[69:48.72]Okay, that makes sense.
[69:55.60]Traverse the white light.
[70:07.12]It's the alligator.
[70:08.18]It's the alligator boss!
[70:11.46]No, I remember this guy.
[70:13.10]He's got like a big... He's split up the middle.
[70:17.13]And I hit him in his, like, tiny little alligator face.
[70:25.29]Sometimes you think I hired somebody to beat Dark Souls 3 for me.
[70:28.46]Well, that would be strange, considering I did the whole thing in front of you guys.
[70:36.04]Gaping Dragon.
[70:38.54]Let's get the items first Because I do see one over there And it is ooh free gear Anymore items don't attack me and I want to like pick up the cool stuff for it.
[70:56.06]All right, let's go.
[70:56.52]I don't see anything else I'm not even gonna lock on to this guy.
[71:03.91]What the fuck is the point of that?
[71:08.49]Oh, I don't know the timing on that.
[71:09.63]I don't know the timing on that move.
[71:12.58]That's slow.
[71:13.40]He's a very slow, slow man.
[71:15.62]Okay.
[71:17.54]Good to know.
[71:22.95]What else do you do?
[71:28.79]Hmm, okay.
[71:31.17]Show me some more of your moves.
[71:36.10]Probably just get behind him.
[71:39.36]Go for his, like, stomach here.
[71:40.58]I don't think I'm... Yeah, I don't want to hit him in the front.
[71:47.97]That sounds like a bad idea.
[71:48.79]He's got a bunch of teeth in this front of his face.
[71:51.39]Oh, there we go.
[71:51.77]Now he's down.
[71:53.61]Alright, he's down to the ground here.
[71:54.57]I gotta hit him in his, like, tiny little head.
[71:56.81]Okay, that's... I know that's the strategy.
[71:58.35]I understand.
[72:00.86]Oh, that's big.
[72:02.16]Gotta hit him right in his tiny little face.
[72:04.20]I just missed completely, but it's alright.
[72:05.94]I understand the strategy.
[72:11.21]Where's he going?
[72:12.71]He's running into the wall.
[72:26.18]Put his head down.
[72:28.44]Head down.
[72:29.30]Do it.
[72:32.88]There we go.
[72:37.36]Woo!
[72:38.48]Don't get trampled.
[72:39.12]Don't get trampled.
[72:39.84]Don't get trampled.
[72:49.65]If you hit him... He's a mousetrap.
[72:54.03]I get it.
[72:54.89]Here he comes.
[72:55.23]I feel like if you hit him more than once or twice there, you'll stagger him.
[73:07.33]Alright, whatever.
[73:08.49]We'll leave it surely.
[73:09.13]Ooh, don't get mousetrapped!
[73:17.30]No, I didn't want to get the cheese!
[73:19.52]No, don't get the cheese!
[73:26.53]Straight down.
[73:30.31]Put your face into my face.
[73:31.59]Come on.
[73:36.07]You can tell when his ribcage starts to... When his ribcage tendrils start to move around.
[73:41.86]I'm not gonna... Wow!
[73:43.06]I was just gonna say I'm not gonna walk off a waterfall, right?
[73:45.30]Huh.
[73:53.91]I was saying it.
[73:54.71]I was thinking it.
[73:55.49]Should I get his tail?
[74:01.39]I don't feel safe here.
[74:04.47]I want to come this way.
[74:08.29]I don't feel safe.
[74:08.91]Bring him all the way back here.
[74:12.75]That would have been so painful.
[74:15.01]I just fucking ran off the edge.
[74:17.99]I'm going to go for the tail.
[74:19.25]I'll get it.
[74:24.43]He's going to charge forward.
[74:25.45]Let's get the tail.
[74:30.29]What weapon is his tail?
[74:32.09]Something cool.
[74:32.81]Why did he swing twice?
[74:33.69]I didn't even press the fucking button.
[74:37.41]He's so huge, I have trouble even determining where I am next to him.
[74:40.47]I wonder if it's further back.
[74:52.28]Alright, get... Can you please fucking stand up, you dumb shithead?
[75:11.69]There it is.
[75:12.43]Dragon King Great Axe.
[75:16.69]Nice.
[75:17.01]Have to take a look at that.
[75:22.08]Everybody, why is everybody looking so sad?
[75:23.92]Alright, he's gonna go to the charge.
[75:29.59]Run forward for a minute or two, and then we'll get him right in the face.
[75:32.41]Once he slows down, I'm gonna try to get him two or three times here.
[75:39.15]One more.
[75:39.69]Greedy.
[75:40.59]There it is.
[75:41.07]Okay.
[75:41.56]Now don't be an idiot.
[75:47.26]What is he doing?
[75:49.55]Oh, he's throwing up.
[75:50.96]What is that?
[75:51.94]Oh, that's a lot of throw up.
[75:53.28]That's a lot of throw up.
[75:54.26]That throw up is going very, very far.
[75:56.16]I'm good.
[76:07.21]Closer now.
[76:07.67]Come on.
[76:07.99]Put your face down.
[76:13.38]Slam it down.
[76:16.41]Okay, this honestly looks better if his tail was his head.
[76:20.62]Doesn't that feel like that's the way the dragon's supposed to look?
[76:24.74]That's almost a cooler boss.
[76:26.32]If they put big eyes on that tail.
[76:29.11]And he hits you with his giant open... Okay, never mind.
[76:32.59]That's not cool.
[76:33.43]That's actually gross.
[76:34.05]What are they talking about?
[76:53.22]Don't be long, come on.
[76:55.56]You're just big, dumb and slow.
[76:56.84]There he goes again.
[76:59.86]Let's see if I can end it right now.
[77:03.38]Greed is not so good.
[77:05.82]Greed is not so good.
[77:06.74]Don't you think about being like that.
[77:12.94]Game over.
[77:13.94]Caping dragon dead.
[77:20.72]Enemy defeated.
[77:22.32]Heat light.
[77:27.08]Twin humanities, homeward bone.
[77:28.12]That's a lot of souls.
[77:31.37]I don't really want to lose those.
[77:33.71]But what is this?
[77:35.29]This looks like an illusory wall.
[77:37.65]It's not.
[77:45.20]I almost ran off this, too.
[77:49.56]It almost looks like you can go down there.
[77:52.58]No, you can't, but still.
[77:54.10]Alright, I know the key is to that door.
[77:59.92]Let's go back and level up.
[78:06.18]Time for Blighttown.
[78:11.44]What is this?
[78:14.12]Can't open that.
[78:20.62]You can if you roll.
[78:21.68]Oh no, I'm not going to try that.
[78:24.20]I'm just going to go back and level up first, guys.
[78:26.26]I ain't going to do any weird shit.
[78:32.87]Check out the tail.
[78:33.53]Yeah, when we get back to the bonfire, I'll take a look at it.
[78:39.52]Did I miss the entrance?
[78:43.28]Put the ring of sacrifice.
[78:46.32]No, I'm not going to waste the ring to laugh about me jumping off a cliff.
[78:54.77]Did I miss it again?
[78:55.41]No.
[78:55.91]Okay, here's this.
[79:04.90]Go back to the bonfire, though.
[79:13.77]Going back to the bonfire?
[79:16.87]Um, isn't it, like, right here?
[79:23.28]Activate the bone.
[79:24.06]I don't need to activate the bone.
[79:27.76]The bonfire's, like, right here.
[79:42.37]We're impatient.
[79:44.47]Well, that's just too bad.
[79:45.69]I'm not going to bone out of here.
[79:49.59]Okay.
[79:49.77]We can do one, two, three.
[79:52.59]I feel like... Let's see the... I want to take a look at the other items we have because we've been using the Zwayander for a long time.
[80:02.44]So let's see.
[80:05.40]Zwayander plus two.
[80:08.70]Gargoyle Tail.
[80:10.46]Dragon King...
[80:14.60]Oh my god.
[80:15.38]380.
[80:17.99]Let's see what it looks like.
[80:23.23]Oh, I love this thing.
[80:26.95]I want to use this thing so bad.
[80:28.31]Are you telling me that I can't use the half-eaten fudgicle right now?
[80:34.78]I can't eat the ice cream?
[80:38.40]This is just the Spider-Man ice cream that somebody left out in the sun.
[80:42.82]Or like baked.
[80:43.60]I wanna use the ice cream.
[80:45.30]Why the fuck not?
[80:46.20]It's 50.
[80:46.60]I need 34 strength.
[80:59.59]How much do I have now?
[81:00.77]Not even close.
[81:02.31]I wanna use the ice cream.
[81:03.15]34.
[81:06.15]That's what we're going for.
[81:07.55]I wanna use this thing.
[81:08.97]I don't care how much it sucks.
[81:23.12]You better believe it.
[81:28.49]It's not even that bad.
[81:29.41]That's cool, though.
[81:30.01]I need to use the ice cream.
[81:36.35]Okay.
[81:37.03]So, now, do I have anything else to crush?
[81:40.65]I do.
[81:41.87]I don't think that's going to get me there, though.
[81:42.97]I need, like, 10,000 or something, right?
[81:44.71]8,600?
[81:44.73]No.
[81:44.81]Get into 34 strength to use the ice cream cone.
[81:53.32]On to Blighttown.
[81:57.30]So, it's probably going to run like shit, even though I know this is the remaster, and those of you that have just kind of trickled in here, I'll give you the quick story in the first, like, 20, 30 minutes of the stream.
[82:08.11]Windows sucks.
[82:09.01]Windows Update sucks, and it, like, bricked my ability to game capture.
[82:12.97]So, Blighttown's probably going to be awful because I'm fucking monitor capturing, which is bad anyways, and it slows down your computer.
[82:20.35]So, this is supposed to be where the remaster shines, and we're not even going to get to see it.
[82:30.97]Although, I'm going to buy some gold pine from this guy.
[82:38.17]He's following me, right?
[82:39.34]No.
[82:40.40]Let's buy two of them.
[82:45.18]Just run out of souls.
[82:48.60]Alright.
[82:52.40]Here we go.
[82:53.92]Skip Blighttown.
[82:56.44]No.
[82:59.52]You can't skip Blighttown.
[83:01.56]It's just... It's against the rules.
[83:03.92]I'm going to take it slow.
[83:04.74]Yeah, you get the classic Blighttown experience.
[83:15.17]Nothing.
[83:16.83]Just checking to see if there's any items or anything.
[83:19.13]Because you know there always might be.
[83:24.17]And there isn't.
[83:29.23]Down we go.
[83:36.80]Get ready for all the memes.
[83:42.04]Alright, we gotta fall from here to there.
[83:48.34]Or climb.
[83:49.24]Either one works.
[83:52.29]Anything else?
[83:57.29]Alright, fat guy.
[84:02.94]That guy takes a lot of hits.
[84:09.14]No!
[84:10.54]He probably dropped something.
[84:12.10]Oh well.
[84:14.66]Don't dodge here.
[84:15.48]That's the one thing I remember about Blighttown.
[84:17.56]Do not dodge ever.
[84:20.41]Don't ever do it.
[84:22.05]You will regret it.
[84:50.05]Case in point.
[84:50.83]I don't even need to make that case.
[84:56.59]I don't need to even say anything.
[85:03.76]10 out of 10 bit.
[85:09.58]I wish it was.
[85:14.58]I'm already starting to feel the lag.
[85:21.78]Whatever, it's fine.
[85:29.82]It was out of instinct, because I was going to get hit, and... Whatever.
[85:44.69]My face is red.
[85:46.29]No, it's not.
[85:46.80]Shut up.
[85:55.56]Don't kick him off.
[85:57.46]Ah, whatever.
[85:58.58]You see, this is not good.
[86:05.46]This is the whole reason why you fucking download the remaster.
[86:14.33]No backstab?
[86:14.99]What is that?
[86:15.57]Hmm.
[86:27.30]Ow.
[86:30.22]I just let him hit me.
[86:36.27]And he dropped.
[86:38.23]Shit.
[86:39.89]I mean, actual shit.
[86:40.91]We're talking real human shit.
[86:43.75]Are those guys considered humans?
[86:45.60]What are these guys even considered?
[86:51.88]Would you guys consider these guys people?
[86:54.98]I think so, right?
[87:05.85]I'm not going to be able to get around him, I don't think.
[87:07.93]Ooh, that hurts.
[87:14.47]Finish him off.
[87:17.05]Goodbye.
[87:20.05]More dung.
[87:22.11]Alright, I could jump down here.
[87:24.31]But let me just... I might not even need to do that yet.
[87:27.04]I mean, I'm here.
[87:33.20]Oh, there they go.
[87:34.28]Right, he's going to come all the way around here.
[87:37.46]Oh, fuck it.
[87:37.88]I'm just gonna go get it.
[87:39.58]I'm already here.
[87:50.87]Come on.
[87:57.13]Don't fucking dodge.
[87:58.07]You're gonna cause yourself a ton of problems.
[88:02.19]Oh my god.
[88:03.57]Don't dodge.
[88:04.17]Don't.
[88:04.55]Fight the urge.
[88:05.31]Fight the urge to dodge.
[88:14.09]It's very pain- I know it's not easy to do that, my friend, but you have to.
[88:32.42]Dodge left!
[88:33.24]Bye!
[88:33.54]Don't get the fucking poison.
[88:47.70]Guy up top that guy's gonna poison me I Know it thoughts to the right now.
[88:56.61]No don't even He's gonna The stupid fucking Tin Man the Tin Man made out of wood I
[89:09.47]What the fuck?
[89:10.27]Oh, this toxic bullshit.
[89:12.27]Oh, I forgot about this.
[89:14.18]Oh, god damn it.
[89:15.56]I can use something, an item, right?
[89:16.60]I have an item I can use.
[89:17.46]I'm pretty sure I can get rid of this.
[89:19.24]I can... I'm gonna die.
[89:44.10]We fucking break, dude.
[89:47.48]Get away from me!
[89:50.90]Okay, do I have any of the cure toxic?
[89:57.95]Reduces poison and toxin.
[89:59.53]Restores status.
[90:03.05]Okay, we're good.
[90:09.28]Those stupid guys with the blowguns, I remember.
[90:13.01]Just need to get to a bonfire.
[90:17.96]Let's bang a left here.
[90:19.06]I know there's more.
[90:23.52]Don't dodge.
[90:24.66]Jeremy, please.
[90:25.88]You're going to cause me so much anxiety.
[90:27.94]I'm watching the stream right now, and I just went... What's left over here?
[90:37.75]That's where I went down.
[90:38.97]Okay, we're good.
[90:39.77]Just want to make sure I didn't miss much.
[90:49.46]Downtown.
[90:51.38]This way.
[90:53.20]And let's keep moving this.
[90:55.03]I know the bonfire is close, right?
[90:57.09]Don't do it.
[91:00.31]Don't you fucking dodge.
[91:01.53]Dodge to the left if you have to.
[91:02.59]Anybody else?
[91:17.60]Guy right there.
[91:18.30]Okay.
[91:21.37]There's a spot over there.
[91:22.19]I know I could probably jump to that, but not going to do that yet.
[91:27.18]There's a lot of places to jump to from here.
[91:29.02]Look at this.
[91:29.42]I could jump to that stuff.
[91:31.74]Not yet, though.
[91:32.40]Give me the bonfire.
[91:34.42]Easy now.
[91:40.06]Okay, we're going to corner ourselves here.
[91:42.96]Somebody fell off.
[91:43.66]Good.
[91:46.92]It's so dark I can't even fucking see.
[91:52.46]That's the worst part about this place.
[91:54.68]You can't even see.
[91:55.84]Even if you turn the brightness up, it don't matter.
[92:02.32]Can I go this way?
[92:04.04]I can.
[92:04.52]Okay, so I can go around here and jump down and grab this item.
[92:09.63]Shadow mask.
[92:10.57]The shadow's set, it seems.
[92:12.05]Okay.
[92:15.13]From here.
[92:15.65]I'm just trying to see where the... I'm going to go back because I want to go in this room.
[92:24.86]Okay, let's eat some stinky cheese for breakfast.
[92:31.40]I'm totally okay eating fucking Gorgonzola right now.
[92:38.03]Oh, whatever, he needs one hit.
[92:41.51]Wait, I can't even go up?
[92:42.57]I almost just fell off.
[92:55.95]My dog is dreaming right now.
[92:57.07]Can you hear this?
[93:01.60]Can you hear it?
[93:14.67]He might be too low.
[93:18.45]He's going...
[93:36.84]How precious.
[93:42.22]What a precious, innocent animal.
[93:44.94]You know what I mean?
[93:45.49]Fuck, where are they coming from?
[93:56.01]Going all the way around.
[93:56.67]Okay, hold on.
[94:02.57]Evil dog.
[94:06.01]This guy's coming around, so I need to wait for this guy.
[94:13.65]He's going to get right behind me.
[94:19.67]I'll break this.
[94:21.25]Don't come behind me.
[94:22.17]Okay, I got that.
[94:28.28]I can fall that way.
[94:32.46]Anything else to do?
[94:37.69]No.
[94:37.75]I'm just gonna have to go this way.
[94:46.04]I'm gonna go back, though.
[94:49.44]Fucking dog.
[94:50.74]Oh my god.
[94:51.46]The poison people.
[94:52.44]Oh my god.
[94:53.46]Oh my god.
[94:56.88]Oh my god.
[95:01.00]Don't roll!
[95:06.12]And this is where the panic sets in.
[95:10.41]This is where the panic sets in I'm dead
[95:43.32]Oh, I fucking hate this place.
[96:00.48]Bonfire's like right there, too.
[96:02.02]What a pain in the ass.
[96:03.02]Ugh.
[96:17.82]I skipped the bonfire.
[96:19.06]Well, I didn't even, like, know.
[96:22.54]This place is a mess.
[96:24.74]You know when people make toothpick forts or popsicle stick fucking log cabins?
[96:33.85]This is like somebody threw together a popsicle stick anthill.
[96:39.43]This place is a mess.
[96:41.90]It's a fucking mess.
[96:58.66]I just got to get to the bonfire.
[97:02.26]Come on.
[97:02.88]I know what you want to do.
[97:03.86]I know you want to do the scary thing.
[97:05.76]But you ain't scary.
[97:06.78]So get out of my way.
[97:14.50]Could have skipped it.
[97:15.54]I can't skip this.
[97:16.36]I've beat it before.
[97:17.52]I've beat...
[97:25.07]And you wonder why.
[97:25.81]Like, I got past this and I was like, well, I don't want to fucking play this game ever again.
[97:29.09]Like, this is where it happened.
[97:32.54]I got past Blighttown and then never wanted to play the game ever again.
[97:39.70]Oh my god, I'm fucking myself so hard here.
[97:50.95]Can I just, like, lose these guys?
[97:53.27]Is it possible just to lose them?
[97:55.43]Oh my god, what have I done?
[98:02.62]Get the fuck out of here.
[98:04.36]I just got auto.
[98:07.66]I win.
[98:08.70]I win, you scumbags.
[98:12.45]And there it is.
[98:12.99]There's the bonfire.
[98:16.59]Yeah, get out of here, you fucking scumbag.
[98:18.79]Just don't fuck this up.
[98:28.72]Get out of my life.
[98:30.98]Definitely going to kindle this bonfire.
[98:43.23]You bet your ass this is getting... Huh?
[98:51.30]Oh, I have to be... Okay, I have to be human.
[99:06.64]Kindle this thing.
[99:07.66]I want ten... What?
[99:13.62]I'm not hollow.
[99:14.30]Kindle.
[99:15.22]No humanity.
[99:15.74]What do you mean?
[99:16.18]What?
[99:16.52]Well, okay.
[99:18.12]I have to... I'm so confused by how this fucking system works.
[99:25.82]This is the only game where you had to do it like this.
[99:34.22]So I have to take a humanity now.
[99:39.55]So I need to be human and then I need to take a humanity and then give it to the fire.
[99:52.85]Okay, here we go.
[100:05.21]Hard versus soft humanity is confusing.
[100:07.47]It's freaking me out.
[100:09.15]Alright, we're good.
[100:11.55]Now here's the point in the stream where I go backwards.
[100:16.27]And let's do this.
[100:19.88]Purple moss.
[100:20.42]Reduces poison buildup, cures poison.
[100:22.16]I don't have any of the toxin ones.
[100:27.10]I guess we're just going to have to deal with these.
[100:30.07]Have it on the hotbar so it's easy to use.
[100:31.73]We're going to go backwards because I want to get items.
[100:37.82]Some weapons scale off humanity.
[100:39.00]Yeah, don't you, um... I was just checking.
[100:51.00]I was just checking to see if I could go over there.
[100:53.88]Maybe I can.
[100:54.48]I don't know.
[100:54.91]It's alright.
[100:55.17]I'm just exploring.
[100:56.19]And I just lost the fucking humanity that I just did.
[100:58.11]I just lost humanity.
[100:58.83]I lost it.
[100:59.59]I just died for no fucking reason.
[101:02.03]Because I was a human and now I'm not human anymore.
[101:03.91]Okay.
[101:04.27]Well, good job.
[101:05.25]Doesn't matter.
[101:11.10]I was... I wanted... Whatever.
[101:13.52]The humanity doesn't even matter in this game.
[101:15.26]It's item discovery and whatever.
[101:17.92]I need to go backwards because I want to see if I missed anything.
[101:24.88]Well, we're going to wait for these guys to come up here.
[101:29.46]Good thing... Oh, I know.
[101:30.14]That actually would be a good thing to prevent invades.
[101:34.60]Fuck me.
[101:35.96]There are items back...
[101:39.83]actually just do that to me?
[101:40.99]Good.
[101:44.46]There's an item here.
[101:45.32]Watch out for the blow dart guy.
[101:47.50]Where is he?
[101:47.88]He's going to shoot one at me from right here, isn't he?
[101:53.68]There we go.
[101:54.38]Okay.
[101:54.72]Blooming purple moss.
[101:55.68]I'm glad I actually turned around to get that.
[102:05.33]Something over here.
[102:09.61]Whoa!
[102:11.23]That's puke-inducing.
[102:13.67]I... What?
[102:14.21]Why?
[102:16.09]I can't stand on that?
[102:21.47]How can there be an item there?
[102:24.78]Huh?
[102:25.82]Alright, hold on.
[102:26.94]Um... That is... I'm getting that fucking thing.
[102:44.07]That didn't kill you?
[102:48.03]You can get that.
[102:48.85]I have to land exactly on it, right?
[102:51.25]Right on the beam.
[102:53.53]Let's make it happen.
[103:10.95]Okay, so I can... Oh, shit.
[103:16.03]It's gotta land right there.
[103:18.65]Can I?
[103:19.03]Is this gonna work?
[103:27.64]Is this gonna work?
[103:28.14]Yeah.
[103:28.26]Yeah.
[103:42.71]Holy shit!
[103:47.25]Okay.
[103:50.05]It has to be exact.
[103:52.63]Just one humanity, that's it?
[103:57.03]Gotta give me more than that.
[103:57.93]Alright, back it up.
[104:14.32]Anything else that I missed back here?
[104:16.10]That's the puke bridge again.
[104:17.08]No, let's just keep going.
[104:21.08]That's the humanity I just lost.
[104:22.29]Yeah, I guess that's true.
[104:23.29]What about from here?
[104:24.01]This looks like a diving board.
[104:27.75]Right?
[104:31.25]Why would I want to be on this?
[104:34.88]You can't get to anywhere from here.
[104:36.08]Maybe I can fall onto this or something?
[104:37.78]There's probably some skip I can do where I can jump to that.
[104:41.18]I don't know.
[104:41.82]I'm not going to pretend to know.
[104:48.97]This place is so messy, I don't even know.
[104:52.22]I'm just gonna go the standard route.
[104:53.56]The fuck?
[105:04.74]Oh, right, right.
[105:05.46]You gotta keep going down, down, down in Blighttown.
[105:10.25]Right?
[105:17.91]Uh...
[105:40.26]Go down on... What?
[105:45.16]I think I'm a little too far out here.
[105:46.39]I'm not jumping off.
[105:49.97]There's like three different ways to turn around and go here.
[105:56.21]Take the plunge.
[105:57.04]I'm not going to take the plunge.
[106:05.68]Almost did, though.
[106:06.86]Almost did right there.
[106:11.34]This goes back around here.
[106:14.31]Down that way.
[106:16.69]I'm pretty sure I can go another way, right?
[106:26.50]Blight town.
[106:30.28]Oh, there we go.
[106:30.90]Okay.
[106:31.26]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[106:33.04]Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[106:34.10]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[106:35.26]So, I'm not gonna respawn all the people.
[106:37.39]It's only one Estus.
[106:38.23]Just, this is, here we go.
[106:41.65]Make it happen.
[106:43.41]Uh, let's go right.
[106:47.39]Never mind.
[106:47.79]Hold on, maybe I can drop down.
[106:50.60]No.
[106:53.88]I mean, I can drop down there, but I'd rather see what else is over here.
[107:01.02]Couple of dogs.
[107:02.71]That's not what I wanted.
[107:04.31]Okay, there's quite a lot of people here.
[107:06.35]I'm dead.
[107:11.95]Yeah, goodbye.
[107:20.12]Ugh.
[107:20.48]Ugh.
[107:23.94]Ugh.
[107:31.10]Okay, well.
[107:33.12]Deal with the two dogs that just pull back.
[107:35.46]Come on.
[107:42.43]Oh, please continue to run like shit, game.
[107:45.57]That's what I love.
[107:46.81]Please continue.
[107:55.50]So, I'm... Alright.
[107:56.68]I'm gonna say something that's... It's not gonna be good.
[107:59.62]People are not gonna be happy about it, but I'm gonna say it.
[108:03.68]After Blighttown here, I'm gonna stream tomorrow.
[108:10.13]So, I wasn't planning on streaming tomorrow, but I'm gonna broadcast tomorrow.
[108:13.99]Long time.
[108:14.53]I'm gonna do a long broadcast of Dark Souls tomorrow.
[108:18.29]But, this shit's just irritating the fuck out of me.
[108:22.73]And it's not anything to do with the game.
[108:24.31]It's to do with how I have to capture it.
[108:25.67]I have to, like, reset my whole computer.
[108:27.23]It's not something I was willing to do, but I was going to do that tonight.
[108:30.57]Because I don't want to play this, like, gimped-down version of the game because I have to pull it through my monitor.
[108:35.88]That's just... I don't want to do that.
[108:38.42]So, we'll be live tomorrow.
[108:41.14]We'll get through as much of Light Town as I can.
[108:45.35]I might as well play in the fucking one that came out 11 years ago.
[108:51.10]2011.
[108:51.64]Not 11 years ago.
[108:55.30]We'll start same time tomorrow.
[108:56.95]I might, maybe a little bit earlier, it depends.
[108:58.91]But we'll go for like, I'll try to go for about 6 or 7 hours tomorrow.
[109:03.33]I would rather just be, it'd be a better experience.
[109:06.62]And I know it's not that big of a deal, it's not that noticeable, but it is for me.
[109:12.04]And we played for eight straight hours of, like, crystal clear, smooth gameplay, and now I'm getting... this.
[109:19.08]And it's just like... But we're not done yet.
[109:27.57]I'm toxic now.
[109:28.41]No, yeah, we're done.
[109:32.87]Oh, yeah, we are.
[109:42.50]Damn it, man.
[109:46.54]Hey, look at me!
[109:47.68]Bye!
[109:50.25]Secret!
[110:01.31]It's right here.
[110:02.08]It's not like I went that far.
[110:10.31]Come on, drop down.
[110:11.11]I know you want to drop down.
[110:12.19]You do it every time.
[110:12.93]Do the jump.
[110:22.79]And goodbye.
[110:24.85]I gotta go kill that guy.
[110:27.57]Do I have a really good arm?
[110:28.81]Can I throw a firebomb up there?
[110:36.04]We're good.
[110:38.42]He's up there.
[110:39.56]Where is he?
[110:42.15]Where does he shoot from?
[110:42.93]I can hear something.
[110:45.39]Why?
[110:50.57]I did get the crossbow.
[110:51.52]That's right.
[110:53.60]Where is he, though?
[110:54.28]I can't even see where he is.
[110:54.90]Is he up there?
[111:06.07]Heavy crossbow.
[111:08.49]And do I have any arrows?
[111:09.91]Feather arrow.
[111:11.09]No, I need bolts.
[111:11.83]Okay, heavy bolt.
[111:15.32]How do you aim this?
[111:19.90]Oh, whoop.
[111:22.12]Isn't it like L3?
[111:23.70]How do I like target aim this thing?
[111:26.11]Two hands?
[111:34.93]Oh, I can't aim a crossbow.
[111:39.09]Well, I can't lock onto him.
[111:49.96]So let's put on the bow.
[111:55.76]I can't wield this effectively.
[111:58.90]What if I two-hand it?
[111:59.81]Okay.
[112:08.83]Okay, just go.
[112:10.23]Alright, it's not gonna happen.
[112:11.76]Just give me my sword and where is he shooting from?
[112:14.56]He's up there.
[112:15.12]There he is.
[112:15.60]Okay.
[112:16.50]I just need just to get cover over here so he doesn't see us.
[112:29.78]Two-handed than L2.
[112:30.58]Uh, I couldn't get it to work.
[112:33.90]Missed items over there.
[112:34.96]Fuck.
[112:37.08]Where is he?
[112:43.23]He's up there.
[112:44.59]Can I get up there from here?
[112:45.59]I could jump over there, though.
[112:51.81]Okay, watch out.
[112:52.59]Don't get shot.
[113:02.44]Find a safe place.
[113:05.18]Pretty safe right here.
[113:08.97]Just wait.
[113:10.33]It's not worth running out there.
[113:11.45]I told you.
[113:16.02]Corridors are so weird in this level.
[113:17.98]It's not even worth it.
[113:18.80]You just got to stick to your guns.
[113:20.74]You know what I mean?
[113:24.50]Big bug thing.
[113:27.98]Can I kick this down?
[113:33.36]Go down.
[113:33.98]Let's go down.
[113:34.58]Wait, there's an item.
[113:38.33]I want that.
[113:44.80]Can I get around this through here?
[113:45.99]Maybe I can go up from this way.
[113:50.87]There are no guns in this game?
[113:53.43]Well, I mean, bow and arrow, crossbow is a gun.
[113:58.51]From like the... Huh?
[114:02.75]From where?
[114:03.51]From what spot?
[114:04.79]Oh, he's in front of me!
[114:14.87]Where is it?
[114:20.10]No!
[114:36.29]Calm down.
[114:38.11]Just don't die here.
[114:38.99]There's so many factors.
[114:40.01]There's so many things that are going to try to kill me here.
[114:41.59]I know it.
[114:42.99]I know it.
[114:43.43]Turn around and just watch behind me.
[114:46.25]I know someone's going to fall down and jump and just grab me.
[114:50.42]Eagle shield.
[114:50.98]Where is he?
[114:51.88]No, he didn't jump down.
[114:53.12]Oh, he would have though.
[114:55.76]You know it.
[115:02.08]Hand of Elector.
[115:02.88]No, that's the... I thought I just fell.
[115:09.82]Speaking of... Come on, man.
[115:11.72]Like, get that on the bar.
[115:16.15]Oh my god.
[115:17.21]Don't hit that too many times now.
[115:20.77]Okay.
[115:22.41]From here, I can go... How can I even go from here?
[115:27.55]I can't go up.
[115:29.77]Do I have to go around?
[115:35.62]Am I going to die if I fall here?
[115:37.92]Yes.
[115:46.69]This way?
[115:47.39]Yeah, this way.
[115:48.21]I could jump over there.
[115:59.43]Easy.
[116:00.15]He'll fall on his own.
[116:03.00]Okay.
[116:07.44]Live soul.
[116:10.22]Nothing else.
[116:12.88]Big guy!
[116:13.44]Big guy!
[116:13.76]Big guy!
[116:18.33]How did you hit me through that?
[116:20.01]I refuse to believe that that was possible.
[116:24.22]Unbelievable.
[116:26.10]Unbelievable.
[116:27.80]Not even believable.
[116:37.93]Not even believable.
[116:46.24]Oh, I can't even.
[116:46.82]He's like all fucked up on these ledges and I can't even.
[116:49.46]Don't dive.
[116:50.22]There we go.
[116:55.13]Finally.
[116:55.65]My lord.
[117:01.41]And where the hell did you come from?
[117:09.91]Broken sword.
[117:10.75]Great.
[117:11.17]Alright.
[117:11.43]What else?
[117:11.83]Anything else down here?
[117:18.55]Could go this way.
[117:19.47]Just checking.
[117:23.46]Just checking.
[117:24.88]Don't want to miss anything.
[117:27.00]I could go up here.
[117:27.82]We're going to just go up here.
[117:31.83]Just for the sake of completion.
[117:38.51]Wasn't the stream gonna end?
[117:50.19]I mean, I said once I got to, like, a place to stop.
[117:57.69]There's more up here, huh?
[117:59.31]What's that?
[118:00.05]Is somebody in there?
[118:07.15]Somebody's in here.
[118:07.79]Okay, just pull them back.
[118:11.07]Don't fight them here.
[118:11.83]It's okay.
[118:16.85]He can hit you once.
[118:20.97]Good thing it didn't keep... No, I'm not messing... I can't, man.
[118:23.70]I gotta... Damn it.
[118:34.22]Okay, well, there's a place to go here.
[118:36.88]I could go down or I could go over here.
[118:41.49]Let's check in here.
[118:45.21]Bad guy.
[118:45.71]Bad camera angle here.
[118:53.02]What else we got?
[118:57.28]Careful.
[119:06.00]I don't like this.
[119:08.19]This is a tiny little space to come here.
[119:13.23]Climb down.
[119:16.13]Yeah, I mean, the stream is not going to be that long.
[119:18.99]Just because I want to play with the...
[119:27.08]That's a bad idea, I think.
[119:37.23]Is this a bad idea?
[119:42.11]I don't know.
[119:42.75]The laser beam is going to come out of his penis, right?
[119:44.67]Like, he's going to shoot a laser in here.
[119:46.01]I don't understand.
[120:01.91]I'm down here now.
[120:06.32]Okay.
[120:07.22]Well, that was the big bug.
[120:08.28]Alright.
[120:09.12]Did it drop anything?
[120:11.58]Pyromancy.
[120:19.21]So that takes away the blockage, right?
[120:21.07]Does that do anything for me, though?
[120:26.53]Not necessarily.
[120:27.35]I guess...
[120:34.05]Is there a ladder or no?
[120:39.39]That's not a ladder, is it?
[120:40.79]No.
[120:46.22]So down here, I could go back down here where that big guy was.
[120:48.80]OK, so new spot.
[120:59.98]I'm afraid to even try to go over there.
[121:01.52]Is there an item that I just get?
[121:02.96]Or why would I even attempt to go over there?
[121:08.20]There's a fog gate.
[121:10.18]Is this a boss?
[121:15.51]I don't know if I'm ready for a boss right now.
[121:18.95]Ooh, there's stuff down there.
[121:31.68]Is that going to kill me?
[121:32.60]How far down is that?
[121:40.89]Alright, it's not a boss.
[121:45.71]But... There's stuff there.
[121:48.78]I almost fell off.
[122:11.67]Whip.
[122:13.59]Oh, glad I did that.
[122:21.63]Um... How do I get out of here?
[122:25.45]What did I do?
[122:26.01]Just go keep going that way?
[122:31.12]We'll fall to there?
[122:34.16]I guess right here, right?
[122:38.04]This is gonna get me killed.
[122:49.81]Ooh, a little entry.
[122:53.82]Ooh, a ladder.
[122:55.86]Okay, hold on.
[122:57.26]Wait, wait, wait.
[122:57.82]Bugs and shit?
[123:03.16]That's like a giant hornet.
[123:08.61]Okay, that's a fire hornet.
[123:14.55]You got range.
[123:15.65]I'll give you that.
[123:22.93]Give me a skip or something, game.
[123:30.37]Something.
[123:30.87]Anything.
[123:31.19]Is it a ladder?
[123:51.74]Something else, right?
[123:54.92]Toxic guy.
[123:55.46]Where is he?
[123:55.88]Toxic man.
[123:57.02]There he is.
[123:57.36]Wow.
[124:02.28]Okay.
[124:02.68]Hold on.
[124:03.54]Hold on.
[124:06.16]I need to think about this.
[124:09.12]I got a drop there.
[124:12.46]Right.
[124:14.38]Now.
[124:17.04]Okay.
[124:17.42]Protected.
[124:22.00]Next place is there.
[124:23.20]I can go that way.
[124:27.84]Anything else around here?
[124:28.76]There's a ladder there.
[124:29.71]I could have just went down the ladder.
[124:31.39]Wait till he shoots again.
[124:34.71]Where is he?
[124:35.67]One.
[124:37.41]Two.
[124:38.57]Nothing else.
[124:40.34]He's going to hit me with that shit.
[124:41.42]I know it.
[124:58.37]Dickhead!
[125:03.91]God damn it.
[125:05.24]Oh, I got a falchion.
[125:14.04]Whoa, bugs.
[125:16.68]Bugs.
[125:17.04]They're coming up to the ground.
[125:19.23]They're coming up to the ground.
[125:20.19]All right.
[125:30.06]No, this leads us to here.
[125:32.37]Oh, don't fall here.
[125:33.35]This is so far.
[125:34.27]I'm so close to something.
[125:38.71]I know it, because we're almost at the bottom.
[125:42.03]I want to see where this goes.
[125:42.83]This climbs up.
[125:46.84]This takes us... Okay, there's the... Hold on.
[125:54.72]More?
[125:55.06]I could go... Another one of those fucking bugs?
[125:58.66]Or is that thing dead?
[126:01.27]Is this just going all the way up where I was before?
[126:04.28]It is.
[126:04.52]I just didn't see these ladders because I'm a moron.
[126:06.88]Okay, so you can climb down each one of these ladders.
[126:12.58]I'm just checking.
[126:13.74]I'm just seeing if I missed anything.
[126:15.20]I'm just taking a look.
[126:21.19]I just was taking a look.
[126:22.05]I needed to take a look.
[126:23.07]You need to look.
[126:24.63]You can't just blindly play through, especially here.
[126:26.87]You got to look around.
[126:27.63]Yeah, that way.
[126:32.06]What's that?
[126:33.02]Oh, he's already back there.
[126:34.06]Okay.
[126:34.58]I'm ready.
[126:38.54]Climb down with this.
[126:43.30]Slow and steady wins the race.
[126:45.96]Fast and frenzy.
[126:48.30]Last place.
[127:12.27]You're too tall for me.
[127:20.17]Get away from me, please.
[127:21.97]It's too stressful right now.
[127:27.63]I'm running out of Estus.
[127:38.23]Okay, almost there.
[127:46.47]I can go this way.
[127:47.29]I can go down.
[127:48.19]I'm going to go this way just to check.
[127:52.49]There's nothing there.
[127:53.51]That's poison.
[127:55.59]I'm not going to step in the poison right now.
[127:59.23]That would be a bold, bold move now, wouldn't it?
[128:02.46]All right.
[128:02.78]We got a guy.
[128:03.44]Two guys.
[128:05.98]Two fire lickers.
[128:10.68]And speaking of safety.
[128:14.25]You know what?
[128:14.61]I got him.
[128:17.20]We're talking life and death situation here.
[128:18.66]I'm throwing shit at these guys.
[128:32.57]Eight.
[128:33.69]Eighteen damage.
[128:34.41]Okay, well that was not even worth doing.
[128:41.27]That's one.
[128:43.59]Use fire on the fire enemies.
[128:45.01]Well, is that actually fire or is that... That's explosive.
[128:49.63]Fire, you can... It's not a fire.
[128:52.90]It's an explosion.
[128:54.84]Trapnil and metal and wood pieces get lodged into your stomach and stuff.
[128:57.92]That's not just fire.
[129:02.80]The thing's made out of some kind of weird material.
[129:05.20]Okay, here we go.
[129:09.46]We are at the bottom.
[129:12.08]Do I have the water ring on right now?
[129:15.68]I probably should put it on.
[129:21.22]There's two guys here.
[129:22.96]There are.
[129:23.32]I'm going to go like this.
[129:26.08]Get the shit out of the way.
[129:37.43]I really want to catch one of these guys with a falling L1.
[129:39.95]R1, whatever.
[129:46.16]Well, we're, uh, we're poisoned.
[129:49.64]Large soul.
[129:51.15]How are you still, both of you still alive?
[129:54.23]What happened?
[129:57.56]Get off me.
[129:58.54]Get the fuck away from me.
[129:59.66]Please get off me.
[130:01.96]Okay, I made it.
[130:26.31]And we did it.
[130:28.43]Almost.
[130:32.95]Let's use this.
[130:34.45]One of these should be enough to do one level up.
[130:38.36]And we're looking for spring.
[130:41.86]You know what?
[130:42.16]Let me do... No, I do want to get... I want to use that new weapon.
[130:50.80]Yes, I will kindle it.
[130:51.72]Don't worry.
[130:56.56]Now I have to go human and... Reverse Hollowing.
[131:05.75]Do it again.
[131:06.17]In the bonfire.
[131:17.29]Do it again.
[131:21.56]I guess you can't just do two, right?
[131:24.79]Makes sense.
[131:25.61]Just use two.
[131:28.11]So how high can this stat go?
[131:29.45]Alright.
[131:42.20]So.
[131:43.74]We're still going.
[131:46.44]Can we go to 99?
[131:47.76]Why the hell would it go to 99?
[131:52.42]That sounds insane.
[131:53.24]Alright, this is backwards here.
[131:57.10]And we've got a chest.
[132:01.34]And... That's it.
[132:09.04]Nothing else to do.
[132:10.68]You're a mimic.
[132:16.62]Is it a mimic?
[132:20.83]No, it's a dragon scale.
[132:29.17]Kick it first.
[132:35.37]Oh, I guess I'll need that at some point if I want to level up some cool items.
[132:38.38]Alright, now there we could go... This is just toxic, the whole thing.
[132:50.17]So we need to stand on the spots that are not toxic, like the little sandy beaches here.
[132:57.90]There are items all over the place.
[132:59.08]You know, I might just do an item run here.
[133:00.44]I don't have any salt.
[133:15.42]Who the fuck are you?
[133:19.09]Get out of here.
[133:20.19]Only one of us can wear the sack on the head.
[133:30.72]Get this bug out of my face, please.
[133:33.38]Can we get the fucking bug out of here?
[133:35.20]Can we get the two bugs out of here?
[133:41.79]Fucking god.
[133:43.45]Get these fucking things away from me.
[133:45.91]Oh my god, you... Oh, I can't stand these things!
[133:49.77]They're just locking me in the fucking corner!
[133:59.57]Fuck you!
[134:01.83]Get the fuck away from me!
[134:03.17]Alright, I killed Mildred.
[134:17.06]The harder enemy were the bugs.
[134:18.90]That's how you know this is stupid.
[134:27.73]I got humanity and more humanity and a butcher knife.
[134:39.23]What is that?
[134:41.22]Now, let me just go.
[134:42.14]It's right here.
[134:46.23]Those bugs were harder than the enemy.
[134:48.55]Let's see what it looks like.
[134:54.56]We have a couple of new items, actually.
[135:00.64]So we got... I want to see.
[135:03.19]Where is it?
[135:03.55]There it is.
[135:03.89]Okay.
[135:05.27]B scaling on the Falchion.
[135:09.21]B scaling on the Aiato.
[135:12.25]D, C, B?
[135:13.99]Scaling on the butcher knife.
[135:15.73]That's pretty good.
[135:18.25]That's actually really good.
[135:22.73]Huh.
[135:23.65]Okay.
[135:25.15]Didn't I pick up one other thing?
[135:26.35]I really want to use this.
[135:31.47]Oh, the whip, right.
[135:32.43]B scaling on the whip.
[135:33.37]Can't use it.
[135:35.23]Is that A scaling on the bow?
[135:36.60]Alright, well.
[135:40.34]I want to put it on.
[135:40.84]Let me try some moves with it.
[135:43.81]It's only strength scaling, so... Let's see.
[135:48.26]It's definitely a lot faster.
[135:53.84]The moveset's kind of boring, though.
[136:08.83]Hmm.
[136:12.95]The R2 is nice, but it's kind of a standard just... I guess it could hit more than one enemy, though.
[136:17.92]That's pretty good.
[136:18.42]What else does it have?
[136:20.88]Somebody says it has lifesteal.
[136:28.11]Does it?
[136:32.68]Uh, regular weapon, axe, giant fortune knife wielded by the undead man-eating cook lurking in the depths.
[136:37.49]More tool for subduing and preparing life.
[136:39.11]Catches an actual weapon.
[136:40.09]Those who have faced this deadly blade have a deeper sense of how helpless they must feel.
[136:51.82]Well, maybe I'll use it.
[136:54.94]Okay, we're gonna, you know, we're gonna use this.
[136:57.34]We're gonna use this until we can use the ice cream cone.
[137:03.14]So, but, for the time being, I can't really leave, so I can't really upgrade this.
[137:07.38]Let me just check it out for a little while.
[137:24.28]So, I mean, we're leveling up strength anyways, so maybe I could just use this in the middle.
[137:31.68]How does this... How much range does that have?
[137:33.65]171.
[137:33.67]That's not bad for the R2.
[137:35.59]Probably really close range, though.
[137:40.98]Back to the Zwayander.
[137:43.36]Just for the sake of we're probably close to... And what about armor, too, man?
[137:48.38]I gotta take a look at that.
[138:02.38]We're almost there.
[138:04.06]Four more strength and I can put it on.
[138:12.08]Mmm... Might be able to get one more here.
[138:14.38]Hope I don't regret this.
[138:17.48]Need like 9,000.
[138:26.67]Hey, it's gonna work, right?
[138:31.53]Perfect, okay.
[138:36.14]Three more points.
[138:39.68]Am I going to stay?
[138:40.34]Yeah, I'm still going.
[138:41.84]It's just like, don't be surprised if in another hour or two I'm just like, yeah, fuck it.
[138:47.20]I want to play tomorrow.
[138:49.46]I don't know.
[138:49.72]We'll see.
[138:50.02]We'll see how long I can tolerate how much I hate this.
[138:54.00]Not the game.
[138:54.48]I'm having a blast.
[138:55.28]The game's awesome.
[138:56.65]I'm talking about my display capture issues.
[139:06.41]Yep, I am.
[139:14.90]Get this off the fucking bar.
[139:16.40]Seriously.
[139:16.80]Let's go up.
[139:25.66]He hates the game.
[139:27.68]No, I don't.
[139:29.88]Items in here?
[139:32.83]There's an item behind you, right?
[139:34.43]There has to be.
[139:37.13]Is there not... I don't see any glowy thing.
[139:46.92]I can do something with this, can't I?
[139:48.26]Is there a... I think I can come back up or up or down.
[139:55.81]It's like an elevator to somewhere, right?
[139:57.15]I don't know where, though.
[139:57.87]That's an elevator.
[140:01.55]I don't know where it takes me, though.
[140:18.31]Almost just fell off.
[140:22.07]Hiccups?
[140:22.67]Yeah, you're going to notice a handful of hiccups.
[140:28.22]You're going to actually notice a lot of hiccups because it's not the game.
[140:31.68]It's not Dark Souls Remastered doing it.
[140:33.24]It's my computer.
[140:33.88]Asshole, come on.
[140:48.39]This is the shortcut out of Blighttown.
[140:50.17]Okay, well that makes sense.
[140:51.15]I'm just going to open it just because I'm here.
[140:55.25]Can I?
[140:55.43]I'm not even sure I can open this.
[141:08.66]This way.
[141:14.92]What the fuck?
[141:20.32]I'm just, like, looking at the tree and shit.
[141:22.16]Like, leave me alone.
[141:22.84]I'm not going to even use the thing.
[141:24.07]I'm just exploring.
[141:25.03]Let's see how far I can get.
[141:29.45]Oh, come on.
[141:29.75]He's still alive.
[141:30.43]What about this way?
[141:39.64]Item in here.
[141:41.66]And a chest.
[141:46.99]Tin Banishment Catalyst.
[141:48.77]So I'm assuming that's a caster weapon.
[141:52.18]So S3 and shit, yeah.
[141:56.08]And I'm fucking poisoned.
[141:59.10]I'm ticking.
[142:00.00]I have two dots on me right now.
[142:03.57]And I'm not even going to cleanse him up.
[142:09.81]Anything else down here that I can do?
[142:13.09]I think falling here is going to kill me.
[142:17.37]Let's go back.
[142:18.13]And we're going to go up.
[142:28.25]And we're going to go up again.
[142:35.10]Homeward, back, no, that's alright.
[142:36.58]I know I'm going to die.
[142:37.92]Just kind of doing like a short little item run.
[142:48.66]Looks like I got everything there.
[142:49.89]What about this way?
[142:54.79]Nothing.
[142:55.73]You're gonna... Come on.
[142:59.45]Heal the toxic?
[143:00.17]No, I only have one more clump.
[143:01.67]If I'm just going to run until I die, until I find items, it's not worth it.
[143:09.75]I have one Estus.
[143:11.37]Yeah, I'm dead here.
[143:12.23]Oh well.
[143:13.25]Alright, can I... Something I can do?
[143:14.39]Can I jump to something?
[143:15.97]Pick a spot.
[143:16.61]Right here.
[143:19.95]Nope, whatever.
[143:25.43]I only have one Blooming Purple Moss.
[143:30.31]Use a Homeward Bone?
[143:31.07]I don't even... I'm going to be right here anyways.
[143:33.39]I lost Humanity.
[143:38.95]Oh, I don't even use it anyways.
[143:41.27]Alright, let's go.
[143:41.97]I'm going to do the progression.
[143:44.47]AKA another item run.
[143:45.53]Let's go.
[143:54.21]I know there's items back there, around the corner.
[143:56.07]There's one over here.
[143:56.83]Because I can run through this shit.
[143:59.67]I'm not slow.
[144:01.04]Yeah, fuck this.
[144:01.82]Let's do an item run.
[144:02.50]I just want to pick up the shit on the ground.
[144:12.06]Like, aka this thing.
[144:13.30]Another large soul.
[144:21.58]It's over here.
[144:22.95]Some slugs.
[144:29.32]More items.
[144:31.34]Yes, over here.
[144:36.86]Item runs, by the way.
[144:38.48]Yeah, these don't count as deaths.
[144:39.58]You can't.
[144:41.28]I know I'm gonna die.
[144:44.24]Whoa.
[144:44.96]Okay, that's a lot of stuff over here.
[144:46.33]That's fine.
[144:50.29]I'm gonna keep going over this way.
[144:51.37]We're just gonna run around this whole swamp until we die.
[145:00.90]They do count?
[145:02.06]Well, I mean, to you maybe, but they don't count to me.
[145:04.54]Because I'm not dying to enemies.
[145:07.10]I'm dying to complete area.
[145:11.49]I just want to get thing in area.
[145:13.73]Run around and pick up items in area.
[145:18.95]Alright, that's going that way.
[145:20.49]What about over here?
[145:25.43]Any more?
[145:27.29]I could go that way.
[145:28.15]We'll go that way after I go through here.
[145:31.21]So falling isn't a death.
[145:32.15]No, falling is a mistake, so that's a death.
[145:34.69]What I'm doing right now is not fighting enemies or a mistake.
[145:38.82]It's just run around in a circle, picking up items, knowing I'm going to die.
[145:44.26]That's not a real death.
[145:45.26]That's like an intentional death.
[145:51.98]And then nothing back here.
[145:52.85]Oh, that's bullshit.
[145:56.03]Farm leeches.
[146:00.09]Why? Why am I doing this?
[146:03.51]Do they give you something?
[146:12.19]Why am I- Why would I kill them?
[146:15.87]Alright- Oh! No, no, no, no, no, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, item, item, item.
[146:25.02]The leeches drop a good item sometimes. Titanite.
[146:29.02]Alright. You're not gonna have- you don't tell me twice man, I'll do it. There's a lot of leeches over here.
[146:36.02]A lot of them actually. So we can just group them up.
[146:44.02]Just because you accept it and you're being reckless doesn't mean it doesn't count.
[146:47.02]Well I mean I'm- I'm just- I mean it doesn't count.
[146:53.96]Look, okay, it'll count if one of these leeches kills me.
[146:59.28]Because that's me getting killed by a leech.
[147:10.43]Nothing else over here.
[147:13.13]That's unfortunate.
[147:13.81]There's an item there, though.
[147:15.27]Makes it all worth it.
[147:15.91]There's gonna be something cool.
[147:23.92]So satisfying.
[147:29.70]Was that- were you guys just feeding me total bullshit, or do these guys sometimes drop something cool?
[147:41.85]Server.
[147:45.05]Server?
[147:47.67]What the hell is server?
[147:55.44]Curved greatsword used in a mysterious ancient rite imbued with a frightful occult energy which restores HP with each hit.
[148:07.91]God damn.
[148:16.29]This thing's pretty cool.
[148:19.94]I kind of like the tadpole weapon, but I don't think I'm... I'm not going to be able to use it.
[148:25.62]It's C scaling with dexterity and I can't... I'm not doing that.
[148:30.52]Butcher knife restores HP also.
[148:34.27]Yeah, let's level this up.
[148:34.95]I'm going to use it.
[148:39.15]He found where Comcast keeps your internet.
[148:47.90]This is the banishment catalyst.
[148:51.13]Yeah, this is a spellcaster.
[148:53.23]The whip.
[148:53.65]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[148:54.71]The halberd.
[148:56.53]Yeah.
[148:57.03]This is the thing, though.
[148:57.90]They have the Dragon King ice cream stick.
[149:00.44]I can't wait to play with it.
[149:03.06]What is this way under?
[149:03.88]There it is.
[149:07.20]Just poison ticking.
[149:08.08]That's fine.
[149:08.58]Alright, we got the item.
[149:10.83]Although it was cool to look at, but I'm not going to use it.
[149:13.01]Let's go up the tree.
[149:24.93]check the attack on the whip yeah sure why not that's not the whip here's the whip I love that here it comes yeah can you do two whips no what about one-handed
[149:54.94]I mean, it's cool.
[149:55.66]I'm not gonna use it, though.
[150:00.96]Let's go up the tree.
[150:10.61]Unless there was one more spot to the left of the tree that I didn't look at, right?
[150:16.21]Over here?
[150:19.26]Yes.
[150:20.00]And there is... Uh-huh.
[150:24.67]Always check your corners.
[150:28.67]Because there might be a green Titanite shard.
[150:33.79]You know, sometimes it's there.
[150:35.61]That's not there every playthrough, you know.
[150:39.08]There's an 8% chance that that's there.
[150:41.40]Alright, I think that's a good enough item run.
[150:56.29]I don't know what this is.
[151:00.86]This is a thin tree.
[151:05.72]Into... Ah!
[151:09.57]A plank shield.
[151:10.85]Ooh.
[151:11.07]You didn't think I knew this was here?
[151:22.08]Twin Humanities.
[151:23.70]What, you didn't think I knew THIS was here?!
[151:42.45]Cheater.
[151:43.79]No, I actually... I've played up until this point.
[151:48.47]This is the last part of the game that I've played through.
[151:51.08]But I didn't even do this part.
[151:52.81]I took one look in here, and I said, nah, and I turned around.
[151:56.55]This spider queen lady is the la- I don't know, I shouldn't even light this, should I?
[152:04.06]I don't- nah, I shouldn't light this.
[152:05.08]I'll come back here later.
[152:10.42]It's exactly what I did before.
[152:14.13]Yeah, this Quelaag, this lady...
[152:18.26]is the last boss that I have seen in Dark Souls 1.
[152:20.92]Just light it.
[152:24.12]Don't sit.
[152:24.66]No, I'm not going to light it.
[152:25.40]I don't want to.
[152:28.05]Light it.
[152:28.33]Don't rest.
[152:28.75]I don't want to light it.
[152:30.43]I don't want to do that.
[152:31.77]I don't want to light that.
[152:50.09]Everyone's getting so triggered right now.
[152:54.29]No, no, no!
[152:55.51]Light it!
[152:56.88]Light it!
[152:58.56]Why is he not lighting the fire?
[153:02.14]Somebody kill him!
[153:05.23]Where is he?
[153:05.73]Somebody kill him!
[153:08.37]He smoked the light, that fire, and he did it!
[153:14.13]I'll fight him.
[153:15.09]I'll fight him when I see him.
[153:17.05]I'm gonna push my fist in his mouth so fucking hard it breaks through his head.
[153:21.41]Alright, I think I can level up again.
[153:31.94]This should take me to at least close enough.
[153:36.36]One more.
[153:38.76]Right?
[153:39.08]Yeah.
[153:41.01]Jex would have lit it.
[153:41.81]No, Jex didn't light it because he didn't want to.
[153:45.47]It's that simple.
[153:51.82]No.
[153:52.80]Actually, I'm not going to use a kill one bug.
[153:55.38]Then I'll get it.
[153:55.84]One of these idiots.
[153:58.26]That's it, right?
[154:03.82]Was that?
[154:04.15]It might be 99.8.
[154:06.81]Just to be sure.
[154:07.51]I didn't fucking memorize what it was.
[154:09.27]There we go.
[154:14.45]We're going to do... You guessed it.
[154:16.97]Strengthening.
[154:19.65]Alright.
[154:20.07]Let's go fight the... It's this way, right?
[154:23.91]Isn't there a boss over this way?
[154:25.91]Up there?
[154:26.21]I'm pretty sure there is.
[154:32.13]It's over there.
[154:32.77]But I like the guy holding the giant cube.
[154:34.28]Alright.
[154:36.38]We're going cube guy.
[154:38.95]Yeah, that's over this.
[154:39.73]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[154:40.35]That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.
[154:42.39]We're gonna have to get poisoned, but it's okay.
[154:44.07]We get to fight the guys with the cubes.
[154:47.91]We're gonna get poisoned here.
[154:48.83]That's alright.
[154:49.39]This is an item run.
[154:52.77]Yeah, this is still technically an item run, because there's items underneath the cube, guys.
[155:00.11]So, this is not what you think. ...
[155:11.82]Put it down.
[155:12.96]Wait, he's rolling it at me?
[155:14.26]Like a dung beetle?
[155:15.08]That wasn't a backstab?
[155:18.04]Get out of town.
[155:20.34]How is that not a backstab?
[155:22.66]Thank god I did that.
[155:23.44]I would have died probably.
[155:31.19]I don't... No.
[155:35.61]Throw it.
[155:42.69]Mm-hmm.
[155:44.69]Ow.
[155:44.99]Are you not a backstab?
[155:46.23]I'm right there.
[155:50.19]He dropped a rock on him, then he died.
[155:53.84]Pickaxe and dung pile.
[155:59.12]Great club.
[156:00.12]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[156:01.80]Hold on.
[156:07.51]I can use this now.
[156:11.32]I could use the turkey leg right now I'm just gonna walk around with it for a minute It's a germa craft weapon, what do you mean?
[156:32.24]How is this a germa craft weapon?
[156:42.34]No, we're not going to use the turkey club.
[156:45.30]I don't want to use the turkey.
[156:48.90]I want to use the butcher's knife.
[156:52.85]Until we can... No, I want to use the ice cream.
[156:56.85]I probably can use the ice cream by now.
[156:58.95]After this boss.
[157:02.15]No items back here?
[157:07.86]He doesn't want to use it because you said Germacraft.
[157:10.17]No, I just... I don't want to use the big turkey leg.
[157:12.39]I want to use the ice cream stick.
[157:15.01]I thought I was very clear with that.
[157:20.19]Item. 280.
[157:39.22]I didn't hit him.
[157:42.62]I just get the item.
[157:43.66]I don't even need to fight these guys.
[157:44.64]I don't need to fight the giant dung beetles.
[157:49.06]Over here.
[157:55.34]No.
[157:56.40]I'm just checking.
[157:57.00]I want to make sure I don't miss items.
[157:59.58]We picked up so many cool things to play with and look at because I didn't just rush right to the area.
[158:04.29]I didn't need to fight somebody.
[158:08.94]Missed an item.
[158:10.96]This is the last portion of the item run.
[158:17.52]Okay, that's it.
[158:21.17]You can put away your president sleepers, okay?
[158:25.99]I'm ready to go.
[158:28.85]And there was a large titanite shard, so it was worth getting.
[158:31.69]I mean, it's cool, but we're not going to use it right now.
[158:33.75]I think I got followed all the way back here.
[158:37.24]I did.
[158:37.82]He rolled the whole way.
[158:42.28]Okay, well.
[158:48.39]I've checked every corner.
[158:49.75]Alright, do not follow me.
[158:56.29]Down here, this is the Quelaag's domain.
[158:58.39]Now let's get rid of this poison.
[159:03.84]Heal.
[159:06.56]And give me my weapon back.
[159:12.62]He's still coming after me, isn't he?
[159:19.90]They're trying to put it through the hole.
[159:21.60]I don't think he can do it.
[159:23.24]They're going to be like, you go first.
[159:24.66]I'll try it.
[159:27.58]That's so funny.
[159:29.25]Didn't you play this game when you were a baby?
[159:30.91]You can't fit it through that hole.
[159:32.37]It's too small.
[159:36.13]He gave up.
[159:37.97]I think they've given up.
[159:39.47]Yeah, oh well.
[159:44.06]Isn't there a merchant down here or something?
[159:45.58]Oh yeah, it's like the diseased Ninja Turtles.
[159:51.82]I forgot about these guys.
[159:52.70]Alright, here we go.
[159:58.81]One, two, three, go!
[160:09.87]She is the queen spider.
[160:14.71]Lady Quahog.
[160:23.00]Let's see how she looks in 3D.
[160:26.50]I mean, not 3D.
[160:27.36]In remastered HD.
[160:30.76]You can't see anything.
[160:31.56]They're not there.
[160:33.76]She has a hair bikini, guys.
[160:35.00]It's okay.
[160:38.90]Chaos Witch Quahog.
[160:43.07]Mm-hmm.
[160:43.85]Here we go.
[160:45.39]And... Spits out fire.
[160:47.89]Let's go for a leg splash.
[160:50.41]Not that one.
[160:50.89]What about the ass?
[160:53.44]Okay, don't play smart here.
[160:56.00]She sprays... I gotta face... Yeah, I gotta face her head away.
[160:58.78]I think she sprays fire in a lot of directions.
[161:01.50]And you can get overwhelmed by it.
[161:09.48]Here comes the fire.
[161:11.86]Oh, I missed.
[161:15.96]Damn it.
[161:20.73]No.
[161:21.63]Getting close.
[161:22.35]Not that close.
[161:27.83]Mmm.
[161:38.97]Go this way.
[161:39.87]Spread out the fire a little bit here.
[161:41.04]I don't want to get too far back that way.
[161:47.80]I'll get overwhelmed.
[161:48.64]Damn it.
[162:00.53]Should have waited.
[162:01.99]Here it comes.
[162:08.01]Don't get greedy.
[162:11.40]What's wrong with her?
[162:12.80]Wow!
[162:15.04]Oh!
[162:16.72]Oh!
[162:20.00]Didn't fucking know she did that.
[162:34.24]Easy.
[162:34.52]Watch the fire.
[162:46.22]I was lucky.
[162:46.52]Okay, what do we got for fire?
[162:48.69]Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire.
[162:50.57]Let's fire back here.
[162:51.23]Pull her all the way over here.
[162:53.31]Come on now.
[162:59.32]Fire.
[163:02.42]Didn't hit her.
[163:02.98]Bullshit.
[163:12.43]Got the hit.
[163:12.83]That's what I wanted.
[163:20.32]Owie.
[163:26.50]Easy now.
[163:33.19]Alright, take her down here.
[163:36.21]Oh, fuck.
[163:39.75]Away from the flames.
[163:40.59]There it comes.
[163:45.97]Okay, good.
[163:51.88]One more.
[163:53.18]Slow it down, Jeremy.
[163:59.35]Do it again.
[164:05.19]Oh boy, mama.
[164:08.89]Just... The fire.
[164:17.34]The fire just fucked me.
[164:21.92]Oh, I didn't even... God, fuck you.
[164:26.44]The fire.
[164:26.92]That was... I was doing so well.
[164:28.94]Bumped into a goddamn fire.
[164:32.37]Bullshit.
[164:34.91]Oh, how irritating.
[164:37.79]That's why you have to bring her back and forth and last forever on the goddamn ground.
[164:41.89]I had it too.
[164:46.10]That's so... Whatever.
[164:52.55]Stub my toe on fire and that's enough to lose.
[165:04.80]God damn it.
[165:05.68]It was perfect.
[165:08.74]It was perfect.
[165:10.10]It was perfect.
[165:13.52]Let's go.
[165:14.00]I got like water all over my hands.
[165:28.95]Same deal, you gotta drag her around all the way back.
[165:33.93]So you can spit in the sand.
[165:34.99]Alright, I got it.
[165:35.81]Wait, what?
[165:52.56]What is that?
[165:53.70]She did it right away!
[165:57.81]She did it immediately.
[165:59.77]It took her like four minutes to do that last time.
[166:08.27]She starts with that?
[166:09.10]You're gonna start with the bomb?
[166:11.56]Come on, man.
[166:15.62]You can't play me like that.
[166:16.68]You can't start with the bomb.
[166:26.94]God damn it.
[166:27.74]Whatever.
[166:28.14]Don't you guys just love having to take a purple moss clump every time you go fight this lady?
[166:45.15]Oh, I love it too.
[166:55.26]Alright, let's go.
[166:57.22]Just like a pitcher in the Major Leagues.
[166:58.60]If somebody hits a home run off of you, you have to delete it from your memory.
[167:00.94]It didn't happen.
[167:03.08]Just like a pitcher.
[167:04.26]You're playing in the Major Leagues now.
[167:05.44]Come on.
[167:17.71]Come this way.
[167:31.96]No?
[167:33.06]Fire?
[167:34.86]Fire.
[167:41.82]Thought I dodged that right now.
[167:45.60]Okay, that has a lot of range, doesn't it?
[167:52.54]Much more aggressive right now, lady.
[167:57.56]Will you do something?
[168:10.52]Hold on now.
[168:14.10]All the way back.
[168:14.69]Bring her over here.
[168:16.71]There's too much fire over there.
[168:18.05]I ain't cool with that.
[168:20.69]Too much.
[168:26.88]That's fine.
[168:27.32]Do it over there.
[168:29.92]Why...
[168:45.15]Is it me?
[168:45.69]She's just like, she's going like erratic right now.
[168:48.11]Finally.
[168:48.55]It's taking you this long to do it.
[168:51.74]This is bad.
[168:57.79]I got a bad placement here.
[168:58.79]I gotta go all the way back here.
[169:16.58]Fire.
[169:16.86]Okay, all the way back this way.
[169:27.60]Come on, follow me.
[169:30.34]Follow, follow, follow, follow, follow, follow, follow.
[169:36.49]You can do it.
[169:38.45]I know you can.
[169:39.09]Man.
[169:50.38]Should it?
[169:52.37]Yeah, good.
[169:57.43]Don't overdo it.
[170:10.82]Perfect.
[170:12.99]No, you don't.
[170:13.35]Let's take her all the way back here now.
[170:19.32]I don't like all that over there.
[170:20.28]Here we go.
[170:27.27]Explosion!
[170:27.81]Explosion!
[170:28.37]Explosion!
[170:28.97]Explosion!
[170:31.90]Calm down.
[170:49.99]Okay, back this way.
[170:50.78]All the way back.
[170:54.32]Sheeps to the bomb, that's good.
[170:56.87]Follow me!
[170:59.07]I'm over here!
[171:38.39]Take her over here.
[171:38.95]Over this way.
[171:39.55]All the way.
[171:39.93]All the way.
[171:40.59]All the way.
[171:47.08]Bad spot!
[171:53.30]I'm good.
[172:10.27]God damn it Hmm
[172:46.84]Double it up.
[172:48.04]Don't do it.
[172:48.92]Here comes the explosion.
[172:49.76]I knew it.
[172:50.24]I knew it.
[172:50.62]I'm not going to get myself killed here.
[173:00.55]Game over.
[173:04.63]Whew.
[173:05.45]Okay.
[173:06.77]Done deal.
[173:09.24]Soul of Quahog.
[173:15.28]Alright, good.
[173:15.74]How many times did I scream?
[173:21.21]20,000, sounds good Anything else in this room?
[173:35.94]Bad spot, I thought I was dead there I was not in a good place
[173:45.32]Nothing else?
[173:46.68]Okay.
[173:48.01]So, ladies and gentlemen, this is as far as I've ever gotten in Dark Souls 1.
[173:53.49]Everything from here on out is something I have never seen.
[173:57.05]Ever.
[173:59.42]I've known a few places and things to do, but this is, at this point, 100% blind from here going forward.
[174:19.53]Yeah, this is the other bell, right?
[174:27.63]Pull it.
[174:35.94]Pull it.
[174:44.22]Blind sense fortress.
[174:45.64]I don't even know what that means, but I'm sure we'll find out.
[174:57.39]Oh, there he is.
[174:57.81]That's Sen.
[175:05.05]So they're opening that door that Ziggward was standing in front of.
[175:09.61]I assume that's the natural progression of the game here.
[175:13.73]Back down by the... Blacksmith, who we need to visit.
[175:23.32]Homer Bone, ring the bell!
[175:26.93]All right, so what else is here?
[175:31.99]Is this another zone too?
[175:40.50]This looks like a elevator.
[175:46.18]But what is this?
[175:57.94]New... zone.
[176:00.26]Here's the demon runes.
[176:05.83]Uh, I'm gonna level up here.
[176:07.51]Just because.
[176:08.01]Alright, so does Quelaag have anything interesting for me?
[176:24.32]I'm sitting down.
[176:27.27]Let's see.
[176:28.71]One more strength and I can put on the new weapon.
[176:35.17]So I'm going to crush the thing.
[176:36.33]It's a dex item.
[176:38.61]Okay.
[176:39.53]So it's trash.
[176:46.24]Let's find out if this is the biggest mistake.
[176:48.42]Was getting to 34 strength.
[176:49.62]I need a little more.
[177:00.08]What's the new weapon?
[177:00.70]The ice cream cone.
[177:01.78]Or the ice cream stick.
[177:07.96]It's time to try it.
[177:11.99]I'm so excited.
[177:12.83]I finally get to use the Dragon King Great Axe.
[177:19.31]Oh, wow.
[177:23.18]What is that move?
[177:25.60]What was that?
[177:32.29]You do an ice cream area of effect attack?
[177:41.81]Okay, we're gonna use this for a little while.
[177:49.34]Do these guys do anything?
[177:53.06]I missed something up here.
[177:53.98]Am I fat rolling now, though?
[177:57.87]Yes, I am.
[177:58.93]Okay, we're going to have to do a little bit of finagling here.
[178:04.87]Let's see.
[178:05.47]This is wonder... Elite armor.
[178:10.79]We can take this off now.
[178:12.87]I want poise, though.
[178:16.17]Hollow warrior.
[178:17.01]How much poise am I losing?
[178:23.02]Shadow garb.
[178:29.50]Hard leather.
[178:30.12]These have toys.
[178:33.81]Wanderer coat.
[178:34.71]Let's see.
[178:38.53]Okay, I'm not bat rolling anymore with this on.
[178:46.24]Yeah, I have Havel's ring on right now.
[178:56.29]I'm alright with this for now.
[178:57.26]Take the shield off.
[178:58.12]The shield gives me a permanent passive stamina increase.
[179:05.22]Alright, so... Let's just take this area for a spin.
[179:09.56]I want to see what this is.
[179:10.24]Oh, wait.
[179:12.30]I missed something back here, though.
[179:13.27]Hold on.
[179:18.13]It's not Havel.
[179:18.77]It's Havel.
[179:25.94]I can't wait to use the ice cream stick.
[179:29.20]Look at how awesome this is.
[179:30.48]Or it's like a candy apple that somebody took a bite out of already.
[179:35.69]However, whatever you want for your own headcanon.
[179:38.57]You know, is it a lollipop that somebody took a bite out of?
[179:40.91]Is it a Spider-Man ice cream stick that's been rotten?
[179:44.21]Is it a... Is it dirt?
[179:49.43]Is it just dirt on a stick?
[179:50.31]I don't know.
[179:50.77]Whatever you want for your own headcanon is yours.
[179:53.03]You know, I can't change it for you.
[180:03.28]Is it an axe?
[180:03.90]It might just be an axe, you know?
[180:07.44]But for me, no.
[180:08.46]Sorry.
[180:08.74]Alright.
[180:11.31]Somebody said that there's... I missed something back here.
[180:14.71]I'm going to assume it's probably right here.
[180:18.25]No.
[180:20.45]There's an illusion wall somewhere.
[180:32.40]Too far back.
[180:35.51]Oh.
[180:38.21]Before the stairs.
[180:39.67]Just again.
[180:43.36]Go up.
[180:44.90]There's so many directions.
[180:46.32]Is it in this room?
[180:47.14]In here?
[180:49.76]Am I getting baited here?
[180:51.54]Or is there actually like an illusion wall somewhere in here?
[180:55.29]I'm so close.
[181:01.27]By the big circle.
[181:11.18]Yeah.
[181:14.58]Oh, dear.
[181:15.60]Oh, dear.
[181:15.84]What have we here?
[181:16.90]I hear a new motherfucker.
[181:20.68]How do you answer?
[181:21.36]Yes or no?
[181:23.20]Uh, this is a covenant, probably.
[181:24.58]Should I take this?
[181:25.32]Should I be the covenant?
[181:27.30]There's a spider lady over there.
[181:32.08]Uh, yes.
[181:34.48]But you have no eggs.
[181:37.62]Eggs.
[181:38.86]Well, I pray that you...
[181:40.86]Oh, thank you.
[181:43.40]Thank you.
[181:50.64]And there's a bonfire here.
[181:53.40]This is a already kindled bonfire, too.
[181:56.62]There's my fair lady.
[181:57.92]Alright, what about over here?
[181:58.82]You got anything over here?
[182:05.67]No.
[182:10.76]Okay, hi.
[182:17.62]Fire Keeper Soul, I don't have any.
[182:20.22]She doesn't say anything.
[182:22.14]Enter Covenant.
[182:26.14]Join Covenant.
[182:30.23]Should I just join Covenant?
[182:31.89]Kill.
[182:38.11]Can you abandon Covenants in this game?
[182:39.91]I don't even know.
[182:45.56]I hope this isn't a bad idea.
[182:55.56]Kill it before it lays eggs.
[182:57.15]I did it.
[183:09.67]Pyromancy.
[183:10.29]Great Chaos Fireball.
[183:13.85]Offer Humanity.
[183:18.23]So what do I get for doing this?
[183:23.35]If I give humanity, I'm assuming I get something in return, right?
[183:29.91]I'm gonna do it once.
[183:35.86]Does she talk to me now that I'm one of the spiders?
[183:38.24]No.
[183:40.12]Smash your head in with a rock.
[183:48.46]I'm gonna give her a humanity.
[183:52.73]Oh, I need to... Okay.
[183:55.95]You can unlock a shortcut for 30 humanity.
[183:57.91]Whoa, what a waste of fucking humanity.
[183:59.41]No thanks.
[184:00.01]Give me 30 humanity.
[184:09.02]Let's go to the demon ruins.
[184:10.02]Let's take a look down here.
[184:16.88]This is just a fire link waiting room.
[184:23.67]That's too much.
[184:24.37]That's too much.
[184:24.95]It is.
[184:28.65]Skips two bosses.
[184:34.11]Yeah, but I don't want to like skip content.
[184:35.81]I've never seen it before.
[184:38.31]I can understand if this next area sucks.
[184:40.89]And it's horrible.
[184:41.65]And no one wants to do it.
[184:43.19]And you get through it.
[184:44.07]Finally, you do it once.
[184:45.01]And then it's like, oh, alright, fine.
[184:47.14]I'll skip everything.
[184:49.32]It's alright, though.
[184:49.98]I'm not... These guys attack?
[184:54.34]They look like they're about to attack.
[184:55.62]Why don't we try the ice cream?
[184:58.82]I missed.
[184:59.22]How?
[184:59.32]366 damage.
[184:59.54]Are you shitting me?
[185:20.03]That is so much.
[185:22.81]And this thing can be upgraded?
[185:23.93]Okay.
[185:29.87]Okay, there's a lot of Wizard of Oz monkeys over here.
[185:40.94]I'm not sure if I should be concerned about this.
[185:42.50]Am I going to get... Do I get fire shoes?
[185:54.24]Is it like a Super Mario Fire Shoe upgrade here?
[185:57.68]Does it kill me?
[185:58.74]Can I walk on this?
[185:59.92]Or is it going to kill me instantly?
[186:08.39]Okay, well.
[186:12.31]That's really scenic, I guess.
[186:16.65]I didn't know if it was going to tick slow or I don't know.
[186:18.57]Okay, so I can't go this way.
[186:24.67]This is probably like the fishing spot.
[186:28.45]Either that or that's where you summon Ragnaros.
[186:41.88]These things hurt more than the guy.
[186:47.64]Anyone want to jump?
[186:51.52]Oh wait, over here.
[186:55.03]I can see something over there.
[186:55.95]There's a thing over there.
[186:56.69]Is that the spider lady that I just fought?
[187:06.49]Alright, well, this looks to be the right way.
[187:13.80]Is Pate gonna show up?
[187:14.92]Not Pate, uh... Poppo, what's his name?
[187:19.62]He's in all the games.
[187:21.82]Pa...
[187:23.60]Paella?
[187:24.54]What's his name?
[187:25.14]What's the guy's name?
[187:26.04]What's his name?
[187:27.46]Patches, there it is.
[187:28.14]No boss?
[187:28.52]Okay.
[187:55.85]This is a long, winding road.
[188:05.36]Ragnaros is coming out of there, ain't he?
[188:08.56]And then I'm gonna have to run all the way down and hit him in the legs or something.
[188:11.71]He's gonna have really tiny, weak legs.
[188:15.09]And the speedrun strat is you have to get all the way back down there and hit him in his, like, baby legs, right?
[188:26.27]What the fuck is that?
[188:31.08]Okay, well, I don't want to look at that yet.
[188:37.00]There's something over here.
[188:38.52]First and foremost.
[188:45.95]There's nothing else to do.
[188:48.51]Okay, I think... I think we have to fight the giant fireweed.
[188:55.66]Are we going to get... Is it going to be a nameplate?
[188:57.44]Is it no nameplate?
[188:58.28]Oh, is this not a boss?
[188:59.24]Is this like the undead dragon?
[189:00.28]I can target him.
[189:02.28]Item?
[189:02.50]Alright, well, hi.
[189:07.17]How are you doing?
[189:10.77]I don't know where your face is, but it's somewhere over there.
[189:17.71]Okay, he's... I told you he had little baby legs.
[189:19.57]Look at those things.
[189:21.91]Why is he not attacking me?
[189:29.61]gold.
[189:32.49]Well, here we go.
[189:34.59]Whoa, whoa.
[189:35.15]Easy, buddy.
[189:36.37]What's that do?
[189:43.15]How do I fight a guy that I can't do?
[189:44.45]I can't go over there.
[189:46.55]Whoa.
[189:48.41]Okay.
[189:48.59]Figured it out.
[189:50.55]Yep.
[189:50.87]Okay.
[189:51.09]I got it.
[189:51.33]I got it.
[189:51.57]I got it.
[189:51.79]Just get it.
[190:05.26]Easiest one, two, three.
[190:14.75]Come on.
[190:15.13]Three hits.
[190:16.59]Do it again.
[190:22.04]Is this it?
[190:22.38]This is it, right?
[190:23.86]Does he do everything with phase?
[190:38.85]Alright, just twice is all I can do there.
[190:40.19]I'm gonna kill him.
[190:56.76]Okay, uh... Did I just beat this boss?
[191:10.70]Oh.
[191:15.64]Okay.
[191:17.00]That was a... That was much easier than I thought it was going to be.
[191:23.94]And that... Okay, so now that wasn't like a real boss.
[191:26.26]That was a drain the lake boss.
[191:28.26]I essentially just pulled a lever.
[191:31.16]Equivalent, right?
[191:35.69]No souls for that?
[191:36.75]So he wasn't even a boss.
[191:37.79]Whoa, a lot of souls.
[191:38.79]Okay.
[191:45.47]Well, I can go down there now.
[191:46.43]I guess that's where we're going.
[191:51.02]Let me just go... Oh, there's a lot of those weird winged guys over there, too.
[191:59.42]Let me go to the bonfire again.
[192:01.38]Yeah, let's just bone out of here.
[192:07.53]I'm running away.
[192:08.25]I have plenty of bones.
[192:09.07]Let's just go.
[192:14.31]Jumped as a trampoline.
[192:17.42]Wouldn't that be something?
[192:21.43]Alright, I got the 34 strength.
[192:22.25]Let's do some more endurance here.
[192:23.87]Endurance and vitality.
[192:25.91]I'm going to get endurance to like 30.
[192:32.23]Also, we've determined that this thing is not good for me, right?
[192:35.77]Just crush it.
[192:36.41]It's a dexterity weapon.
[192:51.45]I should be able to do another one here.
[192:52.55]$50 from PanMan92.
[193:01.39]Thank you so much for the $50 and you say you give me a ceaseless discharge.
[193:10.02]Well, thank you for the $50, dude.
[193:13.74]That's a lot of money.
[193:15.56]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[193:18.97]Much love to you.
[193:21.77]That's deep cash.
[193:23.29]That's deep cash.
[193:28.88]Appreciate it, dude.
[193:31.20]Thank you, Pan.
[193:33.30]RIP 2,000 souls.
[193:36.26]I did something wrong?
[193:40.12]Did I?
[193:40.40]I don't think I did anything wrong.
[193:47.45]This is not going to get me there.
[193:48.35]I shouldn't have done it.
[193:53.19]Alright, well, let me... I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I don't want to kindle this bonfire.
[193:59.71]Should I?
[194:00.05]I probably should.
[194:00.99]It's just... Because... You can give that to some other person and he'll give you more.
[194:14.08]Whatever, it's fine.
[194:16.47]Not too worried about it.
[194:29.53]Is this ball gonna kill me?
[194:31.06]Or can I just skip this part?
[194:31.90]Don't kill me, right?
[194:38.94]Good thing this doesn't burn me.
[194:40.24]Although, this is gonna be very frame-ready for me.
[194:43.89]Oh, well.
[194:45.01]Gonna have to deal with it till tomorrow.
[194:48.41]Item run, item hunt.
[194:50.95]There's probably some random items.
[194:51.91]There's a guy lying in the fire.
[194:53.19]I might be able to get it.
[194:55.84]If I put on, like, the spider shield, I'm able just to tank it, right?
[195:06.59]Interesting.
[195:09.51]Interesting to put all this stuff, all this terrain back here and have nothing back.
[195:12.65]That's a lot of enemies, though.
[195:16.72]Is this a 1v1 situation?
[195:18.96]Or am I going to have to fight seven people, eight people at the same time?
[195:24.61]Okay, is that an NPC?
[195:28.13]I don't know.
[195:29.01]I can't tell.
[195:34.53]NPC, right?
[195:35.15]Yeah.
[195:35.95]Yeah.
[195:36.87]Thanks for the reminder.
[195:41.47]Wait, that's just a copper demon.
[195:44.47]So what, do I have to fight to fight like a baby copper demon?
[195:48.80]Holy fuck, it just is the copper demon.
[195:50.86]Oh my god.
[195:53.70]Was not expecting this.
[196:08.76]Really?
[196:21.66]God damn it.
[196:22.62]This fucking lag is killing me!
[196:27.98]God damn it, man.
[196:30.27]This, like, chugging bullshit is sincerely pissing me off.
[196:36.45]Fuck windows.
[196:38.60]Fuck Microsoft.
[196:40.68]Fuck their entire company.
[196:43.02]I hope they go fucking bankrupt.
[196:52.33]We played at a crystal fucking 60 FPS two days ago.
[196:57.09]God damn it.
[196:57.81]Stuff this fucking goddamn Windows update up your ass, Microsoft.
[197:01.65]Seriously, fuck you.
[197:07.70]Ugh.
[197:20.62]Once I get, like, in the thick of it here, once I turn my fucking camera, I lose 12 FPS.
[197:23.84]Well, magically, we're not lagging anymore.
[197:48.24]Magically, we're not fucking lagging, huh, Phil?
[197:59.05]Make sure you do integration with Kodak.com on the next fucking update.
[198:09.21]What's down here?
[198:20.83]No, it's only Capra Demons.
[198:25.55]Okay, well, we're gonna fight only Capra Demons now.
[198:31.78]Is this a mod?
[198:32.52]Are we playing somebody's modded server?
[198:37.64]Who's got a rock?
[198:39.56]Somebody's throwing rocks.
[198:50.61]Come on.
[198:57.57]And I almost fell.
[198:59.01]Not quite, though.
[199:00.20]I need to parry.
[199:03.34]I have to parry.
[199:04.20]This is not gonna work.
[199:04.82]Yeah, I'm gonna die here.
[199:15.50]No sense fighting this guy like this.
[199:16.74]I'm too slow.
[199:20.03]Although, I have to parry and switch back.
[199:28.16]Okay, well, that didn't work.
[199:29.14]Well, neither did that.
[199:36.09]I'm going to parry it, apparently.
[199:51.25]Come back later.
[199:51.77]Well, I'll get my souls.
[199:52.99]Do it again.
[199:57.16]Kill him in one hit.
[199:58.86]I mean, easier said than done when you find him on a walkway that small.
[200:19.84]Stun lock him.
[200:21.27]I was gonna try to- I was diving R2 probably better.
[200:23.45]Let's try it again.
[200:36.22]Just come back later.
[200:37.32]Am I not supposed to be here right now?
[200:40.50]I'm assuming probably not, but whatever.
[200:42.00]Fuck me.
[200:46.28]I'm gonna die.
[200:59.11]What?
[200:59.39]Ow!
[201:00.47]Okay, if I get the lunging R2, I can follow it up with an R1.
[201:10.45]Not close enough, though.
[201:21.80]I literally can't progress.
[201:22.92]This boss is locked.
[201:23.94]Oh.
[201:27.02]Well, let's just get the souls then.
[201:34.34]There's an item right there, though.
[201:35.32]I want to get it.
[201:37.48]Avoid these guys and just get this item.
[201:40.19]A couple of items down here, actually.
[201:53.01]Oh, wait.
[201:53.75]He's not coming out.
[201:54.39]He thinks he's too fat to get out here.
[201:59.05]What is that?
[201:59.97]Okay, easy.
[202:09.75]That's not even... That's not even a smart thing to do.
[202:12.76]It's a bonfire.
[202:13.46]That's not even smart.
[202:14.52]This is not smart.
[202:18.28]Is this a situation where if I stand in the same place, he won't be able to hit me?
[202:28.82]Kind of.
[202:29.12]He's dead.
[202:36.61]So... I'm not gonna rest at it.
[202:44.41]I wanna get the items.
[202:51.52]No more of those.
[202:52.04]What is that?
[202:54.36]Is that thing... Is this thing gonna stand up...
[202:57.26]I don't know.
[202:57.60]This thing looks like an alligator monster.
[202:59.30]I don't know if I can go by that.
[203:01.70]He looks like he's ready to activate.
[203:04.74]Is he going to activate?
[203:07.72]Please don't activate.
[203:08.60]What the fuck is this?
[203:11.78]Who's the stone Slimer?
[203:17.17]Okay.
[203:20.35]Well, stone Slimer is not that bad.
[203:23.97]He's going to activate when I touch this, isn't he?
[203:28.50]Nope.
[203:35.18]Alright, just... I'm going to turn around.
[203:38.60]I'm going to turn around and not go here yet.
[203:41.88]I'll homeward bone out of here and then we'll go somewhere else.
[203:47.19]Another stone slimer.
[203:52.15]Where are they even coming from?
[203:58.00]Use R2.
[203:58.58]Is that going to damage the weapon?
[204:01.72]I'm afraid to use the... Oh!
[204:04.98]Don't go up there.
[204:06.42]Mistake.
[204:06.80]Are these guys wearing backpacks?
[204:11.33]They are.
[204:13.23]Why do these guys have book bags?
[204:16.59]Okay.
[204:23.03]Okay, so here's the... Here's the plan.
[204:27.51]I'm going to put bone on the bar.
[204:29.93]We're going to run and grab that item.
[204:32.17]And I'm going to press square and hit yes.
[204:35.22]Sounds like a plan to you guys.
[204:36.28]Sounds like a plan to me.
[204:43.80]No.
[204:44.90]No.
[204:46.23]I didn't expect him to run that fast.
[204:51.99]He was sprinting up there very quickly.
[204:55.99]Not gonna happen.
[204:56.65]Alright, but I did get a few of these.
[205:02.89]Which is enough for me to level up again.
[205:08.73]25 endurance.
[205:14.19]Alright, back we go.
[205:20.19]Let the egg guy grab me?
[205:22.93]Who?
[205:23.71]One of these guys?
[205:29.70]What do you mean?
[205:30.06]Like... Let this guy grab me.
[205:38.57]Don't... What do you mean, don't do it?
[205:48.44]Seriously, don't.
[205:58.86]Oh yeah?
[206:03.14]They went too fast.
[206:04.86]They went too fast.
[206:12.70]I'm infected?
[206:13.66]What do you mean he already did it?
[206:16.08]What do you mean he's infected?
[206:27.42]I'm fine.
[206:27.88]I'm still the same blue Skeeter I was earlier.
[206:37.57]I like this.
[206:38.01]I like the red hood thing on here.
[206:39.95]Looks cooler.
[206:44.73]Didn't work.
[206:46.85]Good.
[206:48.37]You guys can be funny guys all you want.
[206:50.77]I'm not going to get poisoned.
[206:56.31]Why do I always listen to that one guy?
[206:57.71]Because one day, you'll be that one guy.
[207:02.18]You'll say something, and I'll look over it, and you'll be the one guy that decides what happens on the stream.
[207:09.78]You understand?
[207:17.51]Let's get 10.
[207:20.25]Now...
[207:22.42]This is where I kind of wasn't sure what to do.
[207:24.70]Now I'm going to go back up through Blighttown.
[207:27.34]Up the waterfall.
[207:30.14]And then... Back to Firelink.
[207:34.16]And then back to where Ziggward was.
[207:38.07]Do I have that part correct?
[207:49.93]Okay.
[207:53.29]Or go to the secret tree.
[207:54.55]I mean, it is right there.
[207:59.12]I could go to the secret tree.
[208:10.84]Stop hanging.
[208:11.84]Stop with this chugginess.
[208:15.94]I got a goddamn six-core CPU.
[208:17.64]You can't handle monitor capture?
[208:19.10]It's goddamn six cores.
[208:25.93]It's the fastest CPU they've ever made in their lives.
[208:28.71]Nothing is faster.
[208:39.56]Six cores.
[208:41.26]Underclocked.
[208:42.76]To make sure they don't heat up too much.
[208:44.28]Because it scares me.
[208:49.38]Can I not get poisoned?
[208:51.38]I would have not got poisoned if I had just had the ring on.
[208:54.16]But I don't have the ring on, so I got poisoned.
[209:00.36]I'll check out the tree.
[209:01.30]Let me just try it.
[209:02.82]Might as well.
[209:03.26]I'm here.
[209:10.19]I could try the tree area.
[209:11.25]What was that slurp sound?
[209:15.53]I don't know.
[209:16.81]Did I do a slurp sound?
[209:22.55]Find a tail to cut.
[209:23.96]I'm currently holding a tail.
[209:26.86]I cut this tail and I'm holding it now.
[209:29.58]This is the item that I'm currently using.
[209:31.16]Is a tail.
[209:33.26]I did cut a tail.
[209:40.93]Don't go in here until I... You know what?
[209:43.01]Fine.
[209:44.21]I'm gonna listen to some of the chatters here.
[209:45.90]I'm not gonna go in there.
[209:46.70]People are telling me you're gonna be very upset if you go in there.
[209:51.71]So we're just going to go back up here.
[209:54.07]Apparently we're not.
[209:59.47]Shit.
[210:02.95]Oh, this item is fucking cool.
[210:06.15]What a great item.
[210:07.61]Alright, where am I going?
[210:08.51]I need to go to the waterfall.
[210:14.49]Yeah, there are some other chatters in here telling me not to do that.
[210:18.91]The tree has materials for the ice cream.
[210:27.44]Go tree.
[210:33.09]God damn it.
[210:33.71]Alright, I'm going to the tree.
[210:36.59]I'm going to the tree.
[210:37.63]I don't know what to do.
[210:43.32]I'm so lost.
[210:45.82]Should I go to the tree and get the ice cream materials?
[210:51.12]You will be upset.
[211:05.73]Let me just get to this bonfire again.
[211:07.35]Don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die!
[211:08.95]Okay, I'm fine.
[211:10.45]Here, I'm fine.
[211:11.03]We made it to- This is where I wanted to go.
[211:32.82]You know what?
[211:33.10]We're going to give one attempt to the tree.
[211:35.05]Okay?
[211:35.81]I'm just going to run.
[211:36.67]I'm not going to do it.
[211:38.07]Whatever.
[211:38.45]Fuck bonfires.
[211:39.83]I'm just going to the tree.
[211:40.87]And we're going to walk in the tree and see what's inside the tree.
[211:43.87]I don't know.
[211:44.15]It could just be one little spot.
[211:45.70]There might be nothing in that tree.
[211:47.60]But I'm here.
[211:48.80]And I'm ready to go in the tree.
[211:49.96]So we're going to go in the tree.
[212:01.00]Like, if I derail the stream for, like, 35 minutes, it's okay.
[212:04.55]I'm just gonna get up there, and we're gonna touch the tree.
[212:08.71]There's no tree boss.
[212:09.81]There's no boss in here, probably.
[212:18.94]For a second, I thought that was me.
[212:20.06]I was like, oh, wow, that's, like, foreshadowing.
[212:21.90]Alright, let's take some poison.
[212:28.89]Anti-poison.
[212:31.16]Let's sit down at this bonfire.
[212:33.04]I'm ready.
[212:39.48]I'm ready to go into the tree.
[212:45.27]I'm going to die here, probably.
[212:47.25]This does not count as a death.
[212:51.39]There.
[212:52.47]Now it has to happen.
[212:59.64]Okay.
[213:00.28]Tree.
[213:00.44]Tree.
[213:05.29]Looks like you just walk through the branches.
[213:11.29]Take a look around for items.
[213:14.97]Spot here.
[213:15.85]Any items?
[213:17.03]Elugiary walls?
[213:24.69]Okay, we got an item here.
[213:25.77]A couple of items, actually.
[213:31.18]Let's get this one first.
[213:37.10]Hold on.
[213:38.30]It's right there.
[213:38.80]What about in here?
[213:40.86]Nothing.
[213:42.36]What is this?
[213:42.74]Why does this exist?
[213:44.38]Illusory wall.
[213:45.74]No.
[213:53.21]Okay, item number one.
[213:53.97]Titanite chunk.
[213:55.75]Okay, now I understand why you wanted me to go in the tree.
[213:58.29]This is just an item run.
[213:59.21]I had a bunch of items and shit in here.
[214:00.57]There's one right there.
[214:02.63]What about over this way?
[214:06.16]Ah, shit.
[214:07.22]Wait, I can get there.
[214:08.60]Can I?
[214:12.04]Yeah, I can walk up this.
[214:14.46]Can I walk up this?
[214:21.55]I don't know if I can walk up that.
[214:24.27]I'm going to jump from here.
[214:31.88]Okay.
[214:32.02]Okay.
[214:38.38]What's this?
[214:41.08]Red titanite chunk.

[215:16.06]What is that thing?
[215:18.06]Nothing.
[215:18.66]It's a branch.
[215:19.23]Okay, item.
[215:30.09]This is so weird.
[215:31.97]I don't like this.
[215:33.03]There's one false move and I'm gonna fall off the whole thing, huh?
[215:37.85]Oh, god damn it.
[215:39.19]There's something right there I gotta go around.
[215:43.97]Patience.
[215:44.41]The entire name of this whole zone is patience.
[215:53.64]Ooh.

[217:00.94]What about up to this one?
[217:05.70]This is going to be tight.
[217:07.66]This is going to be tight.
[217:09.10]Going to be tight!
[217:15.66]Hi, enemy!
[217:26.85]Too tight.
[217:29.93]God damn it.
[217:30.49]Oh well.
[217:30.79]I'm at the bottom of the tree.
[217:32.05]Did I make it?
[217:35.07]I beat it!
[217:35.39]Okay, so I beat the tree.
[217:42.43]Anything else on the bottom?
[217:44.82]Oh, I did not beat the tree.
[217:45.74]There's another way to go down the tree.
[217:49.72]Game, please.
[217:54.57]I'm gonna climb back up.
[217:55.25]I wanna try to get that again.
[218:01.45]Watch out, don't fall.
[218:02.27]Oh, you know what?
[218:03.53]Fuck this guy.
[218:06.73]Climb up here.

[218:20.41]Okay.
[218:22.21]Can we get another attempt on that stick coming out?
[218:26.02]It's on the other side.
[218:26.78]Ooh, okay.
[218:28.76]I think I can go right here.
[218:29.94]What's at the very top of this?
[218:30.84]I just want to see.
[218:35.96]It's a procedurally generated tree.
[218:41.59]Climbing back up to the top.
[218:47.83]I guess so.
[218:50.15]I guess he's right.
[218:51.39]Okay.
[218:51.81]Well, let's go back down.
[218:54.01]Don't worry.
[218:54.35]The climb down is much quicker than the climb up.
[218:56.03]Oh, there might have been a chest or something.
[219:01.55]I don't know.
[219:02.73]How am I supposed to know?
[219:04.14]So we're going for this one.
[219:04.92]This is going to be tight.

[219:25.74]Do I?
[219:26.02]Yeah, I do.

[222:42.82]Just fucking run.
[222:44.56]They'll fall.
[222:45.02]They'll trip.
[222:45.70]They're not as smart as you are.
[222:46.74]They're not even close to being as good as you.
[222:51.98]They're an artificial intelligence enemy.

[223:33.06]It's this one right there.
[223:35.75]Is this thing gonna break?
[223:37.09]This is not gonna break, right?
[223:38.23]That's a big, that's a branch I can stand on?
[223:40.99]I don't trust it.
[223:41.71]I don't think it is.
[223:43.90]Is it?
[223:45.56]Because if I can get that, I can go from there.
[223:47.42]Is this gonna, is this gonna break?
[223:49.82]This thing's not gonna break, right?
[224:04.10]Good.
[224:04.62]It was a slide at a fucking water park.
[224:08.94]Alright.
[224:09.30]No more.
[224:27.07]Up there.
[224:28.67]I want to get that item.
[224:29.39]We're going to go up and down that way.
[224:33.62]Yeah, it didn't break.
[224:34.48]You're right.
[224:35.86]That is technically true.
[224:37.00]It did not break.
[224:39.66]I have to get on that one.
[224:41.76]This one.
[224:48.19]Alright, just like in Mario, when you go on the slide with the penguin, right?
[224:52.11]Okay, here we go.
[224:53.69]Now from here to here.
[224:57.73]You fucking dumb game.
[225:01.89]Never mind.
[225:03.64]It's not destiny to get that one.
[225:10.08]I like this place, though.
[225:11.24]This place is like a little playground.
[225:13.42]I like the playground zone.
[225:19.47]You can move around and have fun on the various little slides and stuff.
[225:24.69]This place is great.
[225:25.69]I'm not even halfway done?
[225:26.89]Good.
[225:27.27]Good.
[225:31.43]Oh boy, that was far.
[225:38.67]Okay, I need that item.
[225:42.75]What's the best way to get it?
[225:47.45]Risky moves.
[225:50.28]Good.
[225:51.42]Okay, there it is.
[225:57.16]Touch it, touch it, touch it!
[225:59.76]Got it, okay.
[226:03.29]Here we go.
[226:09.21]Oh.
[226:31.97]I need to go down.
[226:32.95]No, you fucking dummy.
[226:34.91]Why?
[226:35.19]I'm still alive.
[226:36.85]Item collection run.
[226:37.55]Death doesn't count.
[226:38.71]Item collection run.
[226:52.62]Oh, by the way, I can't drop.
[226:54.18]I'll die.
[226:55.96]If I drop anywhere, I'm going to die.
[227:00.56]It's not gonna kill me.
[227:01.20]Even like a tiny little fall is gonna kill me.
[227:03.08]It doesn't matter.
[227:03.62]I'm dead.
[227:03.90]Alright, I'm just gonna go down.
[227:09.43]I'm going down now.
[227:17.41]Last chance!
[227:24.48]Hold on a second.
[227:25.24]Wowee!
[227:25.88]Hold on a minute.
[227:27.02]Did you see that?
[227:27.70]I could do that again and get that.
[227:29.64]Whatever that was.
[227:37.27]Last attempt at getting that item.
[227:49.35]Just have to jump in there.
[227:50.21]Okay, here we go.
[227:52.19]It's down a few more.
[227:58.48]You stupid!
[227:59.14]You blew it!
[228:01.68]I'm so addicted.
[228:02.54]I can't stop.
[228:03.62]I'm so addicted.
[228:04.44]Let me get the item that's in the tree.
[228:29.52]You fucking really gonna do this right now?
[228:33.65]You're not gonna do this to me, right?
[228:35.11]Like, I have to get in there.
[228:58.20]Damn it.
[228:58.88]I just want to get the item.
[229:00.32]I just want to get the item in the tree.
[229:02.18]I can get it.
[229:02.76]And I will get it.
[229:06.54]I can and I will.
[229:15.06]Getting closer.
[229:16.14]Just get down to this one.
[229:18.68]Slowly but surely.
[229:19.42]Wait, where is it?
[229:20.14]Okay, right over there.
[229:20.96]Down there.
[229:24.80]Down here.
[229:25.50]Alright.
[229:26.98]I might be able to get it from here.
[229:29.34]Is it possible?
[229:31.68]To fall from here.
[229:33.68]It might.
[229:33.98]Yes, there it is.
[229:34.56]Okay.
[229:35.44]Here we go.
[229:37.00]Count it.
[229:37.46]Come on.
[229:38.24]Count it.
[229:43.00]I fucking hate this game.
[229:54.40]At least I got this one.
[229:55.34]Alright, fuck it.
[230:00.08]You know what?
[230:00.36]I don't even care.
[230:01.30]Let's go.
[230:02.60]Let's go all the way to the bottom of Sen's Fortress.
[230:05.64]Wherever the hell we are.
[230:10.80]Going all the way down.
[230:19.70]Can't.
[230:20.38]Can't.
[230:21.09]Can't.
[230:22.01]Okay.
[230:22.83]No more Estuses.
[230:23.73]We're in the shroom capital.
[230:28.29]Another chunk.
[230:30.63]Alright, the guys from Pikmin are here.
[230:33.95]What else is down here?
[230:36.53]What is... I just saw something.
[230:37.59]No.
[230:38.17]It's just a glistening of the mushroom.
[230:46.49]Oh, these guys are from Super Mario RPG.
[230:49.41]This is a standard enemy in Mario RPG.
[230:52.15]In the mushroom forest.
[230:54.43]Okay.
[230:56.64]I feel like... Oh, wow.
[230:57.60]These guys are weird looking.
[230:59.02]Oh, these guys are so strange looking.
[231:00.96]I was too busy looking at these weird guys.
[231:07.92]I like this place.
[231:08.60]I'm not leaving.
[231:09.08]I like this place.
[231:17.25]I'm having so much fun here.
[231:19.87]Look, I get more attempts to get that one titanite chunk over there.
[231:28.47]Okay.
[231:29.49]Now I can move.
[231:38.53]Cloranthe ring.
[231:39.49]What is that?
[231:45.18]Boosts stamina recovery speed.
[231:46.64]Sure, I'll put it on.
[231:50.32]Okay, naked.
[231:51.22]Got the item.
[231:51.76]Let's keep going.
[231:53.38]I'll be able to move much quicker now.
[231:56.22]This might actually be enough for me to get it.
[231:58.44]This is probably what I had to do all along.
[232:05.41]I wouldn't be surprised if this is what I had to do.
[232:13.37]Further down.
[232:15.41]Right here.
[232:19.29]Uh-huh.
[232:21.11]Almost there.
[232:22.43]Hold on to your hats.
[232:24.31]It's gonna get fucking crazy.
[232:31.40]Alright.
[232:32.38]This is it.
[232:39.04]Oh my god, I fucking don't know what to do about it!
[232:41.06]I have to jump, but there's not enough room to jump!
[232:45.60]There's not enough room to jump there!
[232:47.36]It's too slow!
[232:57.22]You have to run and jump over that, but there's not enough space to jump.
[233:00.64]Alright, slow down.
[233:11.29]I'm going at the wrong angle.
[233:18.85]Well, that's because I don't know where to go, because I'm a brain squeeze.
[233:28.41]Alright, we're at the bottom again.
[233:29.67]Where's my armor?
[233:31.71]Why did I take my weapons off?
[233:39.81]Okay, this is a different outfit, but whatever.
[233:41.69]I don't care.
[233:51.80]Watch this!
[233:52.32]No!
[234:01.25]Oh, I'm so fucked right now.
[234:03.13]I am so just mind fucked.
[234:06.15]I can't help it.
[234:10.77]I am just so fucked up right now.
[234:17.61]I'm so weirdly addicted to this.
[234:21.23]And I can't stop and I'm just killing myself.
[234:23.80]I can't get out of here.
[234:25.38]I can't get out of this.
[234:29.46]I just, I gotta get to the bottom of this tree.
[234:39.98]And I have no patience anymore.
[234:41.24]I just want to get there.
[234:42.18]Get to the bottom.
[234:44.38]No, don't go through the hole!
[234:48.93]Watch this.
[234:50.49]I was going to do the R2 and Gandalf, everybody there, but it didn't work out so well.
[235:01.61]Easy.
[235:02.01]Okay, there's a cookie bug right there.
[235:03.09]Let me try to at least get that.
[235:10.48]Get out of here.
[235:11.18]Fuck off.
[235:22.81]I stepped, I slipped, I slipped!
[235:24.55]I slipped!
[235:27.77]Oh my god, I can't stop.
[235:28.90]I fucking... You know when you get to a point when like you cannot stop and you're so fucked up that you can't do it right?
[235:36.14]It doesn't even matter.
[235:38.82]I can't slow down and I can't stop.
[235:45.51]I can't stop and I have to go really fast because I've done it too many times.
[235:50.89]This is the melted plastic weapon.
[235:54.66]I'm just going to get to the bottom of the tree.
[235:55.96]Forget that item.
[235:56.66]I know.
[235:57.16]I'm not going to be able to go to bed tonight because of this.
[236:01.11]And I'm fat rolling.
[236:02.09]Why?
[236:10.13]You guys realize I'm going to be lying in bed thinking of how I should have gotten that item that's sticking out here.
[236:29.16]Is that too far?
[236:30.85]This might be too far.
[236:36.42]Why?
[236:37.88]No!
[236:51.88]gotta get over it I can't get over it guys I really can't I'm like on drugs right now I'm on like dark souls tree drugs no slow down slow down stop taking the drugs for a second okay calm down ah too far wait it's about the same spot oh I'm just gonna find the other angle
[237:17.56]It's not there.
[237:18.22]Where's the correct angle?
[237:19.35]Right there.
[237:20.73]I got it.
[237:21.69]I've just figured it out.
[237:22.83]All I had to do was just stop freaking out for a second.
[237:25.73]It's right here.
[237:27.61]Fall from here.
[237:29.01]Good game.
[237:34.98]Okay, got it.
[237:36.60]But I'm not lined up good.
[237:46.30]It's this one.
[238:00.94]The antidote.
[238:01.62]Who has the antidote?
[238:03.82]Somebody give me the antidote.
[238:06.92]I'm going to turn my game on and go online so I get invaded.
[238:09.39]So people stop me from doing this.
[238:15.97]You know what I'm saying?
[238:18.59]Somebody has to come in here and inject me.
[238:24.44]Otherwise, I'll do this forever.
[238:26.24]No.
[238:28.02]Almost there.
[238:30.90]That's where he died.
[238:32.08]Just got to get on this one.
[238:35.85]All right.
[238:39.37]Let's take a look.
[238:44.28]I just need to find it.
[238:45.19]It was right here.
[238:46.87]There it is.
[238:48.03]It's the one that goes around and wrap.
[238:49.43]Okay.
[238:49.69]It's wraps around there.
[238:53.35]It's just a giant puzzle game.
[238:56.33]Got it.
[238:58.87]So then I need to go with that one right there.
[239:05.74]So how do I get on that one?
[239:07.16]That one wraps around.
[239:09.74]It's split.
[239:10.32]All right.
[239:10.54]So we're going to go from this one to this one.
[239:15.75]Down to here.
[239:18.79]And then over to here.
[239:21.39]Ladies and gentlemen.
[239:23.37]Boys and girls.
[239:25.14]I got it.
[239:25.82]I finally got it.
[240:17.14]What?
[240:20.90]What?
[240:21.28]What?
[240:21.58]What?
[240:21.88]What?
[240:22.26]What happened?
[240:22.95]What?
[240:26.01]Why?
[240:26.61]Wait, hold on.
[240:27.55]What?
[240:33.27]You just... You don't... That didn't happen in the other games?
[240:37.26]What happened?
[240:38.06]What?
[240:39.06]Oh, no.
[240:40.04]No, don't tell me this.
[240:41.10]Don't even tell me this.
[240:43.74]Oh god, this should have been over.
[240:46.26]This should have been over.
[240:48.56]It should have been over.
[240:50.22]It was over.
[240:54.24]I got to the finish line.
[240:56.44]This is gonna kill me.
[241:00.72]I can't fucking believe it.
[241:01.99]I've just stood there like mad and mean.
[241:04.99]No, man, that was not supposed to happen.
[241:07.23]I was... Well, now I know what happens when you get cursed.
[241:13.80]I'm not gonna fuck this up again.
[241:16.76]Go around and drop down on the two that you dropped on before.
[241:19.86]Just hope none of these fucking kill me.
[241:30.23]Okay.
[241:31.25]You psychopath.
[241:34.49]It's so slippery though.
[241:35.39]Look at all this extra moss.
[241:36.51]It's the extra moss.
[241:41.15]This is such a weird angle.
[241:46.36]I don't- I don't- I don't understand.
[241:48.51]Do I have to roll onto that?
[241:50.73]I- I have to roll onto it.
[242:06.63]Oh, yai yai.
[242:08.51]What a fucking nightmare.
[242:10.23]What a nightmare.
[242:18.19]Go to the tree.
[242:19.27]This is why you wanted me in the tree.
[242:21.95]Because the tree is like the poppy fields in the Wizard of Oz.
[242:27.29]I'm stuck here.
[242:28.46]I'm gonna die here.
[242:30.62]I'm not gonna stop doing this.
[242:33.56]Me, the human, is gonna die here.
[242:42.02]Why can't- I can't walk up this.
[242:44.34]What are you- what are you on?
[242:47.39]What do you want, game?
[242:48.21]I can't walk over here.
[242:52.79]That's... That makes no sense.
[242:54.01]That doesn't make no sense.
[242:58.84]I made it work.
[243:00.12]Okay.
[243:05.60]So now I gotta just go through the whole damn thing again.
[243:09.64]Which is what?
[243:10.23]How the fuck did I even... Over here.
[243:16.09]Bingo.
[243:18.43]Bongo.
[243:21.05]Here.
[243:22.59]Alright.
[243:24.41]Now... Okay, kids.
[243:27.39]Okay, kids.
[243:29.02]I'm going for a roll.
[243:31.20]Right here.
[243:31.66]I'm going for a roll.
[243:34.14]I'm gonna go too far.
[243:36.30]Got it, kids.
[243:39.12]I can leave.
[243:39.48]I can get out of here.
[243:46.89]Thank god I can leave.
[243:48.75]I was going to be stuck here forever.
[243:57.91]Don't get cursed again.
[243:58.61]If I get cursed again, it's going to do even more.
[244:01.97]What's at the bottom of the tree?
[244:05.91]Is anything at the bottom of the tree?
[244:08.65]Am I going to get double cursed?
[244:25.29]Okay.
[244:25.77]What's at the bottom of the tree?
[244:28.79]That's all I want to know.
[244:30.23]I don't really care about much.
[244:31.13]I just want to see what's down here.
[244:32.79]What is actually down here?
[244:33.81]I think I tripped.
[244:44.46]It's a little mushroom, guys.
[244:45.52]But besides them, is there a place to go down here?
[244:48.68]There is.
[244:49.16]Okay.
[244:50.12]I'm just going to walk in here.
[244:52.48]I need to know.
[244:53.72]It's a boss.
[244:55.80]There's a boss here.
[244:59.96]No.
[245:01.28]It's more of the tree.
[245:04.54]Ash Lake.
[245:10.12]There's a bonfire.
[245:15.17]And a chorus.
[245:15.95]Okay.
[245:16.17]Okay.
[245:26.76]This place is cool looking.
[245:27.54]This place reminds me of the Bloodborne workshop area.
[245:33.28]Oh.
[245:34.70]It was that thing.
[245:38.54]He's pretty... He's far away though.
[245:39.60]I don't have to fight him.
[245:43.33]What's this?
[245:43.75]This looks like an empty log.
[245:53.12]He's coming over here.
[245:53.92]He's not just in the water.
[245:55.41]He's not just in the water.
[245:56.53]He's coming all the way over here onto the sand.
[246:00.45]That doesn't make any sense.
[246:01.35]Fish can't go on sand.
[246:03.77]That doesn't make any sense.
[246:05.39]Where is he?
[246:11.95]Speaking of not being able to go on sand.
[246:13.43]Alright.
[246:16.34]There's an item over there.
[246:19.35]This is scary.
[246:20.37]I don't like this guy.
[246:22.33]Hold on.
[246:22.67]Any more items?
[246:29.41]I saw an item all the way over... I don't know what he did.
[246:38.63]Oh!
[246:45.62]Oh my god.
[246:46.80]Oh my god.
[246:49.58]He free willies.
[246:51.06]He free willies across.
[246:54.07]Alright.
[246:54.41]He's not over there.
[246:55.09]Give me the item that's back here.
[246:58.33]There's an item that's all the way over here in the water.
[247:01.49]Do you see it?
[247:02.13]I do.
[247:03.27]He's too busy over there.
[247:04.17]Doing the end of the movie.
[247:11.43]Get it.
[247:11.73]Come on.
[247:13.99]I see it.
[247:14.47]It's so far.
[247:18.55]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[247:24.31]He's not coming back, right?
[247:25.23]Okay.
[247:32.70]Hold on, did somebody just say I'm faking reactions?
[247:38.48]I've never fucking seen this before in my life.
[247:45.22]This is a blind playthrough of this game.
[247:48.64]Yeah, I've seen this before.
[247:49.71]I came down here and saw this fucking sand area.
[247:51.67]I do understand this game's been out for like eight years.
[247:59.55]But I never... I almost just walked off the fucking edge.
[248:06.40]Okay, hold on.
[248:13.02]Bonfire, bonfire.
[248:14.36]Why would I go to the bonfire?
[248:15.52]I don't want to be stuck down here.
[248:24.02]Why would I want to use the bonfire?
[248:40.60]No, I can't... I'm not... I don't want to get stuck down here.
[248:42.92]I'm not using that fucking thing.
[248:54.74]Does he have all the humanity?
[248:57.52]I'm gonna die anyways.
[249:01.51]Light it.
[249:01.87]Don't listen.
[249:02.73]Light it.
[249:03.59]Light it.
[249:04.03]Light it.
[249:05.91]Alright, do you do understand?
[249:07.03]Hold on.
[249:07.71]You guys understand that 50% of you are telling me not to fucking light the bonfire and 50% of you are telling me to light the bonfire.
[249:16.41]Do you understand?
[249:17.09]There's no decision I can make there.
[249:19.84]I'm just gonna do whatever the fuck I wanna do.
[249:23.19]Light it, you fucking idiot!
[249:24.89]Don't light it, you're an idiot!
[249:26.71]Well, huh?
[249:28.41]What?
[249:31.06]You understand how contradicting that is?
[249:32.62]Oh fuck, he's gonna do it again.
[249:44.75]He's killing these enemies here somehow.
[249:48.75]These, like, chromatic crabs.
[249:52.47]Do they drop pearls or something?
[249:55.68]Come on.
[249:56.02]It's a crab.
[249:56.36]They have to drop pearls.
[250:04.10]It's like when 100%- This is, like, the problem.
[250:08.44]100% of the people in this chat- Well, I'm not gonna say that.
[250:10.32]Like, 80% of the people in this chat are calling me an idiot for 40% different reasons.
[250:16.81]Who am I supposed to trust here?
[250:17.79]I can't trust anybody.
[250:20.91]Almost just died from that fall.
[250:26.63]Oh, fuck.
[250:31.04]Oh no, oh no, oh no!
[250:37.78]He's gonna die, right?
[250:39.50]Oh, fake!
[250:45.12]Fake reactions!
[250:50.97]I can't... Do you understand?
[250:53.05]It's like, look at the impossible situation here.
[250:57.11]You're an idiot for not doing this.
[250:58.99]You're an idiot for doing this.
[251:01.48]And also, by the way, I think this is fake.
[251:07.14]What?
[251:07.34]What am I supposed to do?
[251:09.54]There's no solution!
[251:22.57]What's the scenario with I come out on top here?
[251:24.71]Alright, well that was fun.
[251:35.34]Now I'm gonna go this way.
[251:55.83]Let's put on my shit again.
[251:56.93]No, that's, aesthetically, I can't handle that.
[252:05.45]So, I'm gonna give you guys a scenario here, okay?
[252:10.04]You, in front of me is a plate of raspberries, okay?
[252:14.48]And there's a hundred people in the room.
[252:19.50]I wake up, somebody like drugged me, and I wake up in a fucking, like, white room.
[252:24.28]And a hundred of you guys are standing there.
[252:28.35]Half of you are screaming, Don't eat the raspberries!
[252:32.59]Don't eat those!
[252:33.71]Don't eat those fucking raspberries, Jeremy!
[252:35.85]Don't do it!
[252:37.95]And the other half of you are saying, Eat them!
[252:40.50]Eat those raspberries!
[252:41.58]It's your only hope!
[252:42.42]It's your only chance at survival!
[252:44.00]Eat the raspberries!
[252:45.56]Well, let me say 99 of you.
[252:46.82]One of you is holding your finger in the air, going, It's not real!
[252:53.38]None of this is real!
[252:54.56]Don't worry, it's not real!
[252:57.85]Am I going to wake up and be like, am I going to eat these fucking raspberries or what?
[253:02.76]What would you do?
[253:04.72]Would you trust the guy that thinks none of this is real or should I listen to half the people screaming at me?
[253:11.58]Let's say I ate the raspberries.
[253:12.72]Okay, I'm going to listen to the guys that said, eat the raspberries.
[253:15.26]Eat them.
[253:15.86]Eat them.
[253:16.06]It's your only chance.
[253:17.11]Okay.
[253:18.29]Okay, I'm going to eat them.
[253:18.93]People are screaming.
[253:23.75]And like my face turns fucking purple and like all of a sudden my eyes start bleeding.
[253:27.61]And those half the people are like, he's a fucking idiot.
[253:31.66]You see what he did?
[253:32.68]Yeah, he's dead.
[253:36.06]I don't know what to do.
[253:36.74]What do you want me to do?
[253:47.25]We got him!
[253:53.55]Eating on his- I'm gonna die here.
[253:55.43]I'm gonna die here.
[253:56.26]Okay, I need to use the purging stone.
[253:59.06]Before I turn back and go out of Blighttown.
[254:09.54]Where is it?
[254:10.02]I'm back to life.
[254:17.65]I need to put on the ring that makes me go very fast.
[254:21.89]That's not it.
[254:22.43]It's this one.
[254:23.05]Okay, let's go.
[254:27.61]Like, would you eat those raspberries?
[254:29.45]I don't know if you would.
[254:32.23]And there's no option.
[254:35.73]You're stuck there.
[254:38.09]Let's go to this one.
[254:38.77]I want to get the 10.
[254:39.25]Am I going the right way here?
[254:43.37]Yeah.
[254:56.07]Now, don't get me wrong, I think it's fucking hilarious.
[254:58.27]But at the end of the day... Like, the decisions that I'm gonna make are the ones that I'm gonna make.
[255:06.01]And if I... Just think, if I push those raspberries aside... I'm gonna... Half the people that wanted to watch me die are like... I'm going home.
[255:16.72]I'm outta here.
[255:17.92]You wanna get an Uber together?
[255:19.22]This is boring.
[255:20.06]This sucks.
[255:22.10]This guy was supposed to die.
[255:30.79]Alright, where's my other shield I was using?
[255:36.41]Here it is.
[255:37.05]39 out of 97.
[255:37.67]I can put on the other thing.
[255:42.48]Gold hem, black cloak.
[255:44.32]What is this thing?
[255:46.58]I do want poise, though.
[255:48.82]16 poise.
[255:49.68]20 poise for the elite knight.
[255:52.64]Let's put elite knight back on.
[255:58.63]Elite Knight again.
[255:59.43]47 out of 97.
[256:01.29]Pushing it.
[256:08.62]Wanderer Boots.
[256:09.52]This could be to 46.
[256:10.70]I need to stay under 50%.
[256:19.86]Wanderer Boots.
[256:20.52]These are okay.
[256:25.96]Black Leather.
[256:26.68]These actually are
[256:29.33]We're in poison right now.
[256:30.99]And I like that head.
[256:32.77]Alright, my bat rolling?
[256:35.14]No.
[256:40.34]Okay.
[256:41.60]Let's go.
[256:42.80]So I need to go up the... The... Where is it?
[256:50.29]Where's the elevator?
[256:51.87]It's like, is it up here?
[256:52.65]It's got poisoned for no reason.
[256:55.47]Hold on, let me sit back down again.
[256:58.05]It's the right or the left?
[256:58.99]It doesn't pay attention.
[257:01.47]How am I still in Blighttown?
[257:02.57]Uh, we went into the tree.
[257:06.83]We went over to the tree land.
[257:08.09]We have to go up this way, right?
[257:18.62]Whatever, I'm gonna get fucking poisoned.
[257:30.05]all of you.
[257:31.59]Weapon is at risk.
[257:32.71]Shit.
[257:36.71]No, it's up that way.
[257:38.23]God, I'm just sitting here looking at the fucking ceiling.
[257:41.34]Goddamn way.
[257:53.55]Chat is pre-recorded.
[258:00.78]You know, we've talked about this before.
[258:04.48]And yes, I am aware.
[258:06.58]I told you this already.
[258:07.76]Like the last time we played.
[258:09.50]Yes, some of you in this chat have beat this game 200 times.
[258:14.03]I have never completed this game.
[258:15.85]This is in fact the only time I've ever seen this.
[258:19.53]Ever.
[258:20.67]Ever.
[258:21.61]First time ever.
[258:23.67]I understand.
[258:24.83]You might want me to eat poison raspberries.
[258:26.65]But I'm not going to do it sometimes because I've never done it before.
[258:34.98]So, that's just the way it is.
[258:37.60]Now, if I ride this all the way up, what happens?
[258:40.16]I fall off.
[258:40.68]Okay.
[258:46.74]That way.
[258:49.94]Anything else I can do here?
[258:57.27]Eat the fucking raspberries.
[259:00.43]No, you eat them!
[259:03.39]You want to eat them?
[259:03.97]You eat them.
[259:05.01]You want to eat raspberries for dinner?
[259:06.29]Go for it.
[259:08.09]I'm not going to stop you.
[259:12.99]Oh, fuck.
[259:13.75]Oh, fuck.
[259:15.46]Oh, fuck.
[259:16.00]Okay.
[259:16.56]I'm up.
[259:25.80]Yeah, you... Some of you... I understand.
[259:27.02]Yes.
[259:27.52]Some of you... You've eaten raspberries.
[259:29.12]Some of you here.
[259:29.80]Maybe more than a hundred times.
[259:32.56]I know you love raspberries.
[259:33.64]I know you do.
[259:34.14]Fucking stupid guys.
[259:41.34]Don't toxic me.
[259:50.83]What's the top?
[259:55.89]Raspberries suck.
[260:01.80]Alright, I need to repair this thing.
[260:04.58]You can't do that move very many times.
[260:06.28]That's an oh shit button.
[260:07.81]If you get surrounded.
[260:08.57]That's... anything?
[260:31.20]Chest.
[260:35.15]Key to New Londo Ruins.
[260:36.89]Would you look at that?
[260:38.29]That's probably going to come in handy.
[260:43.79]There is a place to go this way.
[260:46.81]There's one of those dudes.
[260:52.70]Let's get around him.
[260:54.48]Do I still hate oatmeal?
[260:57.28]No.
[260:57.56]No.
[260:59.69]I mean, yeah.
[261:00.77]It sucks, but I'll eat it.
[261:02.70]If there's nothing else I can eat.
[261:03.58]Oh, I thought he was going to come forward.
[261:24.03]No oatmeal.
[261:24.63]No, I like hot oatmeal.
[261:26.74]Oatmeal that's... You eat it within a minute of it being ready, or don't eat it at all.
[261:32.30]Because then it turns into oatmeal-flavored jello, and it's disgusting.
[261:38.90]Go on.
[261:39.82]I'm faster than you.
[261:41.16]No, it doesn't matter.
[261:42.02]I didn't get it.
[261:48.27]What about the oatmeal with the little dinosaurs?
[261:51.51]Uh...
[261:54.39]What's that reach, man?
[261:57.13]It's gonna break.
[262:05.48]Is it broken?
[262:11.94]Not yet.
[262:25.93]Back swing.
[262:26.81]Back swing.
[262:27.67]Back swing.
[262:30.63]Cream of... Cream... Cream of wheat is better, somebody said.
[262:40.06]You know, I probably would agree with that.
[262:44.60]It's got a better texture, I think, than oatmeal does after being out of the microwave.
[262:49.30]Yes, I said microwave.
[262:50.70]How do you do it?
[262:52.62]I don't know how you do it, but that's how I do it.
[262:54.52]It's easier.
[262:54.98]You put water in it, you dump it in, and you put it in the microwave and you stir it up.
[263:01.72]Valley of the Drakes.
[263:03.04]Finally, we're out of Blighttown.
[263:06.30]And this takes us back.
[263:07.32]Don't fall off.
[263:12.48]This goes... Oh, this... I don't care.
[263:13.40]I know where this is going.
[263:18.68]Now we get to go back to where Sigward was.
[263:23.83]No, this is New Londo.
[263:24.63]Uh, I'm gonna go up first, though.
[263:28.18]Wait, I went the wrong way.
[263:31.19]It's up this way, right?
[263:34.57]It's the correct way to get the fuck out of here.
[263:50.29]See how the gang at Firelink is doing.
[263:51.69]I feel like I should have had, by now, another one of those things that make the Estus stronger.
[264:00.36]Those fire bloom things.
[264:11.92]Alright.
[264:13.34]Back at Firelink.
[264:14.54]Let's see how the world is doing.
[264:19.09]How is everybody?
[264:31.58]What is this?
[264:34.54]Dingy hood, dingy black eye orb.
[264:39.23]What do you mean, dead?
[264:44.85]Dead.
[264:54.49]The lady died?
[264:55.13]Hold on, can I not upgrade Maestas ever again?
[264:58.45]Am I fucked for the rest of the game?
[265:00.69]What?
[265:27.15]Okay, there are other fire keepers.
[265:28.45]I was about to say, what a game-ruining thing.
[265:32.66]Okay.
[265:34.02]Oh, the spider lady, that's right.
[265:35.04]Okay, thank god.
[265:36.94]Why is this guy still alive, then?
[265:44.93]If somebody... I mean, light bonfire.
[265:53.62]Why is this bonfire out?
[266:00.42]What the fuck is this?
[266:06.83]I can't rest here ever again?
[266:12.06]What the hell?
[266:13.02]What?
[266:15.10]This is like a central hub for me.
[266:16.68]I need to be able to come back here.
[266:17.90]Well, I see you made it out.
[266:23.07]Yeah, I made it out safely.
[266:24.89]I have my Pyromancy of the Great Swamp, so I can usually manage with a bit of care.
[266:30.03]Oh, yeah.
[266:31.05]By the way, I think you have a knack.
[266:32.53]I'll be pleased.
[266:36.57]Wait, what?
[266:37.31]I just skipped that.
[266:38.65]Yeah, wonder.
[266:39.29]I'm sure that they'll be here.
[266:41.77]Oh, okay.
[266:42.37]Well, thanks, Pyromancy.
[266:44.09]Well, let's get started.
[266:47.24]Uh, purchase item.
[266:49.22]I'm not a magic man, so...
[266:51.33]Goodbye then.
[266:52.19]Be safe, friend.
[266:53.15]Don't you dare.
[267:00.17]What is this thing?
[267:09.24]What the fuck is this?
[267:10.66]Ah, hello.
[267:15.51]Was it you who rang the bell of awakening?
[267:19.51]I am the primordial serpent, King Seeker Frant, close friend of the great Lord Gwyn, chosen undead, who has rung the bell of awakening.
[267:31.76]I wish to elucidate your fate.
[267:34.76]Do you seek such enlightenment?
[267:36.64]Aren't there two of these guys?
[267:43.71]from catching random dark soul speed runs I think there's another one of these guys right okay so what's my decision um I don't know do I want to be let's just say let's just say yes very well then I am pleased to share chosen undead your fate
[268:10.97]is to succeed the great Lord Gwyn, so that you may link the fire, cast away the dark, and undo the curse of the undead.
[268:22.85]To this end, you must visit Anor Londo and acquire the Lord Vessel.
[268:32.36]Okay, so I gotta go to Anor Londo.
[268:34.66]Feed... item.
[268:40.96]Feed, feed, feed, feed, feed.
[268:43.68]Feed item.
[268:47.34]Oh, thank God.
[268:48.26]I can feed him weapons and stuff?
[268:50.34]Is this the guy you sell to?
[268:51.52]Oh, thank God.
[269:02.57]Okay, perfect.
[269:03.41]Okay.
[269:09.88]I'm not gonna use any of this shit Don't accidentally feed him something I'm gonna use I'm such a hoarder though.
[269:23.04]It's the problem But I want it
[269:40.19]Okay, you can have one of my three Spider-Man heirlooms.
[269:55.24]Wait, what happened?
[269:56.26]Sold my Pyromancy.
[269:58.98]What?
[270:01.11]I'm not going to use Pyromancy.
[270:02.15]What?
[270:02.29]What?
[270:09.79]That's a mistake?
[270:10.75]I'm not going to use Pyro.
[270:14.96]I'm not going to use Pyromancy.
[270:18.26]Ruined?
[270:18.62]I'm not going to use spells.
[270:23.46]Pyro doesn't take intelligence.
[270:25.33]It doesn't require stats.
[270:26.83]It's OP late game?
[270:29.95]Well, that's fine.
[270:30.71]We're going to do it the old-fashioned way.
[270:38.06]Okay, we had a lot of... Sell this.
[270:47.40]What else?
[270:47.94]A bunch of bullshit.
[270:52.63]I don't really want to get rid of this stuff.
[270:53.73]I feel like it could be used for aesthetic purposes.
[270:59.63]I don't want to feed him any of these yet.
[271:00.75]Because I don't know what the hell I want to do with them.
[271:04.21]I'm never going to use this.
[271:08.09]I'm never going to use the longsword.
[271:09.49]Let's be realistic about it.
[271:11.47]I'm never going to use the claymore.
[271:14.02]Let's be realistic about it.
[271:16.72]No mail breaker ever.
[271:19.00]Never the battleaxe.
[271:21.68]Not going to use the gargoyle tail.
[271:23.82]It's not going to happen.
[271:25.64]Not going to use the greataxe.
[271:26.60]It's not going to happen.
[271:27.42]Morningstar, sorry.
[271:29.20]We've got to clean up the closet here.
[271:30.84]No pickaxe.
[271:33.28]No partisan.
[271:34.91]No halberd.
[271:36.82]No, great club.
[271:39.02]No, keep the longbow.
[271:49.61]Thanks.
[271:52.63]Well, he's cool looking.
[272:01.37]Okay, what do I have?
[272:02.21]Do I have any of those things to crush?
[272:04.08]I can't even level up here.
[272:04.92]Why the fuck would I even try?
[272:07.22]Ah, this is a pain in the ass.
[272:08.54]So, now, I can't light this.
[272:10.08]Firekeeper's dead.
[272:17.27]So, let's go over here.
[272:18.89]There's that guy.
[272:22.77]Wasn't there another dude over here?
[272:23.75]There's the sorcery dude.
[272:38.16]There are two extra people here now.
[272:42.21]Who are these guys?
[272:44.15]Oh, hello.
[272:45.47]My guests have finally arrived.
[272:47.41]Who the fuck is this person?
[272:48.07]I will be departing with them shortly.
[272:50.05]So, I'm afraid I will be saying goodbye soon.
[272:53.85]It was a pleasure.
[272:56.23]Oh, okay.
[272:57.99]Who's that person back there?
[273:02.00]Okay, this is the Faith guy.
[273:05.14]Come again.
[273:06.20]The effectiveness of the tea...
[273:14.77]What have we here?
[273:15.99]You look awfully raggedy.
[273:17.77]Times are grim.
[273:18.97]The least you can do is look sharp.
[273:20.69]Don't you dare meet my lady like that.
[273:23.59]You might scare her off for good.
[273:25.41]What, do we have better clothes on?
[273:28.31]Oh, I don't suppose we can help them.
[273:30.14]We accompany my lady on.
[273:31.48]It is quite a chore, but I'm stuck.
[273:33.42]Is she a firekeeper?
[273:34.16]Can she stay?
[273:34.48]I can't know where I've abandoned them.
[273:39.09]Oh, it's weird to leave momentarily.
[273:41.23]What can one do?
[273:42.51]Rarier knocks.
[273:45.08]I gotta look nicer.
[273:49.73]Okay, hold on.
[273:52.01]I can do that.
[274:10.09]Okay, I like the fucking Grim Reaper.
[274:13.17]This doesn't seem to make... Okay, I like this outfit.
[274:15.51]I'm keeping it on.
[274:16.98]Hey, I look nice now.
[274:18.12]What are you going to have to say to me?
[274:19.26]You are undead as well.
[274:20.58]Then we've no time to fraternize.
[274:23.34]I have my mission and you no doubt have yours.
[274:25.76]Fucking undead ice cream man.
[274:27.06]Let's not let this curse overcome us.
[274:31.70]Did I not explain the urgency of our tasks?
[274:33.79]I want to hold down R2 so bad right now.
[274:35.15]Who are you so uncouth as to lack such judgment?
[274:38.15]By the looks of you,
[274:40.55]I should think not.
[274:41.45]All right.
[274:43.45]This looks like the Grim Reaper was outside and he was like eight or nine years old playing with a lighter.
[274:50.72]And he burnt his plastic scythe way too much just to see what would happen because he's nine years old and doesn't understand.
[274:59.30]I like this character.
[275:01.04]Yep.
[275:01.88]I like toddler Grim Reaper.
[275:03.26]I'm keeping it on.
[275:03.84]I don't care how bad it is for stats.
[275:12.75]Well, that's fine.
[275:14.25]Have fun.
[275:20.11]Kill?
[275:21.05]No, I'm not going to kill.
[275:21.81]I need to go to the blacksmith.
[275:24.77]I've got fish to fry.
[275:34.85]We've got some stuff to look at.
[275:48.10]Grim Reaper Muffet.
[275:53.20]I have to look at my inventory.
[275:55.02]What's in my inventory?
[276:06.21]Invade other world of murderer.
[276:09.81]Invade world of murderer of firekeeper.
[276:14.62]Huh?
[276:19.57]What does that mean?
[276:21.19]Invade the world of the murderer of a firekeeper to defeat the perpetrator and reclaim the soul of the firekeeper.
[276:29.39]The black eye keeps constant watch on the city of gods.
[276:34.88]Oh, okay, that's interesting.
[276:41.29]Let's go to the blacksmith.
[276:59.03]I'm not going to fight the smith.
[277:00.11]Do I get 10 here?
[277:12.33]Yeah, well that door is open.
[277:13.81]I want to see what it is.
[277:17.91]Let's see if I can upgrade anything here.
[277:19.92]So upgrading armor in this game is not a good idea.
[277:22.88]Is that true or do I have no idea what I'm talking about?
[277:33.78]Yes, take the large imp.
[277:36.80]Okay.
[277:40.26]Reinforce weapon.
[277:41.78]Can I do it, too?
[277:44.06]I cannot.
[277:44.73]I need 10,000 souls.
[277:45.33]I can, though.
[277:46.63]I can do it.
[277:57.72]So the question is, this is my little backup faster weapon, and this is my crushed skulls weapon.
[278:05.46]That's a lot of souls, though.
[278:06.88]Can I do it?
[278:07.89]Is this going to give me enough?
[278:15.35]No, it's going to be like four.
[278:18.57]Almost.
[278:24.97]There we go.
[278:28.79]That is one expensive ice cream.
[278:32.49]Give Divine Ember.
[278:33.35]Yes, you can have it.
[278:35.89]Okay.
[278:41.55]Drake Sword now can be upgraded.
[278:43.25]I thought you guys said this couldn't be upgraded.
[278:48.06]Alright.
[278:48.58]Dragon King Greataxe.
[278:59.47]Pair this.
[279:06.31]Alright, where is it?
[279:08.07]Dragon King Greataxe to plus one.
[279:12.95]Do it.
[279:16.27]That's a lot of money.
[279:17.51]Okay, so now let's do Butcher Knife.
[279:19.63]Let's get it.
[279:20.23]Let's do this too.
[279:25.35]I don't have any... How the fuck do I not have any Titan?
[279:27.83]No, no, I do.
[279:31.27]I'm doing the butcher knife, too.
[279:36.24]Super greataxe.
[279:39.18]What am I doing?
[279:40.86]Playing the game.
[279:45.84]I want to get this to, like, plus five.
[279:50.51]This is going to be my secondary weapon.
[279:56.43]So, that's why I'm upgrading those two.
[279:59.04]I'm no longer ever going to use the Zoander ever again.
[280:06.84]So I don't have any money, I can't do anything.
[280:15.89]Let's take a look at what happened over here.
[280:23.11]Plus five is the maximum.
[280:25.71]Yeah, I plan on getting it pretty close.
[280:30.09]So, let's see.
[280:30.49]What do we got?
[280:32.77]Sen's Fortress.
[280:33.81]This is... This is what you all wanted to see, apparently.
[280:38.94]Everybody was waiting for this.
[280:44.48]Whoa.
[280:45.88]Whoa.
[280:47.00]There's comic book characters in here.
[280:48.60]This is crazy.
[280:58.69]Oh, there's a guy behind me too.
[281:00.05]Okay, we're about to die to the funny looking snakes.
[281:09.84]By the way, there is no lunging attack with this, is there?
[281:12.08]Just figuring this out right now.
[281:26.18]I didn't get it.
[281:26.62]I tried to switch fast enough.
[281:29.24]Okay, these guys can be staggered, so that's fine.
[281:34.46]Siegward is not here anymore.
[281:38.39]Yeah, where's Squidward?
[281:42.67]Sen's Fortress.
[281:44.53]Would you look at this?
[281:47.71]Soul of a brave warrior.
[281:58.89]God oh, no, you're gonna do the Nickelodeon guts to me.
[282:04.07]This is gonna be bad Shit And they're shooting at me and there's a guy here, too
[282:32.92]Kick!
[282:34.30]Kick him!
[282:39.38]I definitely can't make that jump.
[282:43.63]Alright, we're gonna go across.
[282:45.59]Owie.
[282:46.81]Don't yet.
[282:47.31]Two.
[282:48.33]Now go.
[282:49.39]Ha!
[282:53.65]Go!
[282:55.44]Oh!
[282:55.64]This guy's got lightning bolts up there.
[282:57.24]That's not fair.
[282:57.94]Go up there.
[282:59.88]Let's check this way first.
[283:04.28]A whole lot of nothing.
[283:13.74]This is just trapped everywhere.
[283:15.22]This is gonna be the got ya part of the game, huh?
[283:20.91]I'm gonna have to... Oh man, oh man.
[283:24.39]I'm gonna have to dive forward through that lightning.
[283:32.84]Fuck, okay.
[283:47.58]That didn't work as planned.
[283:54.89]I think you gotta go faster than that.
[284:03.55]Oh well.
[284:09.37]Ah!
[284:12.12]Eventually, do I fight Sen?
[284:14.36]Sen the snake?
[284:20.09]Alright.
[284:23.03]At least they make this one easy.
[284:26.31]I could probably do two at the same time, but I'm too scared to get hit.
[284:34.44]Dammit.
[284:38.59]I'm trying just to kick him off.
[284:39.97]I'm trying to, I'm trying to hit forward and R1 and I can't, it won't happen.
[284:44.63]That move, I swear to God, happens when you don't want it to.
[284:50.56]I'm trying to play the game and I'll just kick fucking randomly.
[284:53.36]When I actually want to do that kick, I can't get it to work.
[284:57.92]I can't even do it because I'm one-handing this fucking thing.
[285:00.52]It has to be two-handed because it's not strong enough.
[285:02.95]Oh my God.
[285:03.91]Video game, please.
[285:20.21]Welcome to Dark Souls.
[285:21.41]This is where you are waiting for.
[285:24.67]You all wanted me to get here so you could watch me get angry at the Nickelodeon level.
[285:28.72]I'm going to get impatient here.
[285:32.40]Can you do two?
[285:37.02]I'm alive.
[285:38.50]I'm alive, baby.
[285:40.14]I'm alive, baby.
[285:45.49]I'm alive, I tell you.
[285:49.94]What's down here?
[285:50.48]We're gonna have to use the power of Christ here, I think.
[285:54.97]Yeah, I'm gonna use the power of Christ.
[285:58.43]I didn't hit anybody.
[285:59.51]Fuck.
[286:02.21]Place to go.
[286:03.05]Place to go.
[286:03.75]Place to go.
[286:22.13]He doesn't climb, right?
[286:23.13]Snakes don't know how to climb ladders.
[286:25.52]Shit, they do.
[286:26.72]Snakes aren't people.
[286:27.70]They shouldn't be able to know how to do this.
[286:30.85]Oh, no.
[286:31.97]What if I do this?
[286:32.47]Hold on.
[286:32.71]Wait.
[286:54.09]I thought I was gonna, like, butt stomp him.
[286:55.43]I don't know if I was gonna fall off.
[286:58.93]This place is fucking wacky.
[287:00.23]Why did I not die?
[287:09.92]Don't step on that.
[287:11.44]Just run by.
[287:12.06]Just get through.
[287:12.68]You can't do it.
[287:13.64]You gotta go one at a time.
[287:14.90]What are you guys talking about?
[287:20.65]Yes, no.
[287:21.15]I'm sorry, guys.
[287:21.75]Snakes are not people.
[287:24.15]They are an animal.
[287:25.57]They're not the same.
[287:27.28]It's not a person.
[287:30.20]I just gotta take this guy out right now.
[287:33.38]Don't even let him breathe.
[287:38.56]Good to go.
[287:38.98]Alright.
[287:40.59]We made it through.
[287:41.29]Now we have to just do that again, but much faster and way harder.
[287:45.01]Sounds like a plan.
[287:50.27]Gotta go one at a time, and then dodge...
[287:55.39]Can I block his lightning bolts?
[287:58.41]I can.
[288:04.37]I'm scared.
[288:07.59]I'm panicking.
[288:08.33]This is me panicking.
[288:10.80]I don't know.
[288:12.00]He could stab through the shield.
[288:14.64]Oh my god, he's biting me.
[288:26.88]Somebody's shooting for me.
[288:27.67]Somebody's helping me.
[288:28.23]Is there an NPC in here?
[288:29.81]Oh no, it's a trap.
[288:35.15]Get out of here.
[288:35.67]Okay, I'm fine.
[288:42.05]What else is in here?
[288:51.00]Large titanite shard.
[288:57.74]This place is so nerve-wracking.
[289:01.40]More shit in here.
[289:02.26]This is going to be something that's going to pull up here.
[289:04.50]Dynamite's going to fall from the ceiling.
[289:06.40]Walls are going to start folding in.
[289:16.39]Wait, why is he alive?
[289:18.29]What?
[289:19.39]He just got hit by a fucking boulder, dude.
[289:21.65]And I'm laughing at him.
[289:23.33]And I'm going to get cartoon networked.
[289:26.62]Why am I targeting the guy down there just hanging out smoking a cigarette?
[289:30.50]What the fuck?
[289:44.07]Okay.
[289:52.71]Okay, I'm gonna go now.
[289:55.11]Holy fucking idiot.
[290:00.00]Now, a good thing that happened to me.
[290:01.46]Good thing that happened because I was about to run down this way.
[290:05.58]I would have died.
[290:07.43]I'm so glad I got hit by that fucking boulder.
[290:10.21]Glad it hit me with the rock.
[290:11.53]Good thing.
[290:12.03]Because we're going over here now.
[290:17.96]I'm dead.
[290:20.30]I'm so high str- I might need to stop streaming.
[290:23.90]We might need to take a break.
[290:25.00]I'm like, I'm so coiled up right now, and I'm a spring.
[290:29.12]And like, boom!
[290:30.70]My spring's gonna go loaded out of everywhere.
[290:37.01]I've told you this before, I can only like play these games for like a few hours, like four or five hours, before all of a sudden, like, I get spring-loaded.
[290:49.88]I'll try it again.
[290:50.52]We're gonna try it one more time.
[290:51.42]I just wanna get to, like, the bonfire.
[290:55.38]This place is fucking hilarious.
[290:56.84]I can't wait to play through this, but, like, I... I'm an accordion right now.
[291:00.08]A closed-up accordion.
[291:01.98]The amount of times that I've gone, like... Or, like... You know, when you play Dark Souls, you take years off of your life.
[291:10.39]You just do.
[291:13.37]I've done the equivalent of, like, smoking a pack of cigarettes for three years.
[291:17.11]Just simply by playing this game.
[291:19.62]That's the amount of damage I've done to my heart and brain.
[291:34.81]Wait a minute.
[291:35.93]Wait a minute.
[291:36.77]Hold on, wait a minute.
[291:38.31]Wait a minute.
[291:43.76]No, it didn't work!
[291:47.72]What was I thinking?
[291:49.30]What was I thinking?
[291:50.07]You fucking accordion.
[291:52.31]You can't make that jump.
[291:53.51]You're not gonna make that jump.
[291:54.71]Why would you even think to attempt that jump?
[291:58.57]I thought I was so smart.
[291:59.65]That was like chess I was playing in my own head.
[292:07.09]What was my plan?
[292:08.31]I wanted to jump into that thing, like, and have, I don't know, whatever.
[292:13.05]Just pretend like you didn't see it.
[292:15.60]It's time for bed.
[292:16.52]I don't know what I was thinking.
[292:17.66]I thought I was going to try to jump, and I panicked because it's scary.
[292:20.84]I get really nervous.
[292:22.20]I'm so high strung when it comes to being on a little platform with pendulums swinging.
[292:26.70]So I get a little too nervous, and then I just jump off a cliff.
[292:30.97]That's just what happened.
[292:38.77]We're going to try this again.
[292:45.17]This place is fun though.
[292:46.46]It's so wacky.
[292:50.60]Why didn't they put obstacle courses in the later games?
[292:53.58]I don't understand.
[292:58.50]How many souls did I have?
[292:59.41]Is it even worth picking up?
[293:01.61]He's just wow, wow, wow.
[293:03.53]Am I in the right place?
[293:12.46]That's another year off my life.
[293:15.58]There's another two packs of cigarettes that I just smoked.
[293:18.22]Instantly.
[293:20.06]I put 24 cigarettes in my mouth and inhaled.
[293:30.66]Okay, the recovery.
[293:32.11]My recovery time is so bad.
[293:34.21]I'm just gonna go up here.
[293:37.35]I get the jump on this guy.
[293:38.47]And I didn't even need to do that.
[293:41.87]I'm confused.
[293:52.17]Okay, die.
[293:53.15]Die.
[293:56.05]I can't even believe it.
[293:57.69]I can't even believe it.
[294:08.44]So.
[294:11.18]What now?
[294:14.86]It's an illusion.
[294:15.48]I would have expected one to be there.
[294:18.43]So I have to just... I don't know what the point of this was.
[294:28.79]So I have to run over here.
[294:32.76]I have to run up this.
[294:33.66]Is that going to work?
[294:35.54]Am I fast enough?
[294:37.50]I'm not sure I am.
[294:46.45]I'm not sure I am.
[294:47.75]Hide!
[294:52.73]Okay, what about up there?
[294:54.23]I don't know what that is.
[294:54.83]Bonfire.
[295:01.38]Is there a bonfire here?
[295:02.14]Nope, it's a chest though.
[295:11.64]Ring of steel protection.
[295:16.89]I'll get this thing off.
[295:17.71]Why is it even on?
[295:20.89]Boost defense versus physical attacks.
[295:28.48]Holy crap.
[295:29.64]That's actually a pretty major improvement.
[295:37.25]Sure, that's a major improvement.
[295:48.68]Don't go down now.
[295:49.34]Okay.
[295:54.80]I'm not the boss already, am I?
[295:59.63]No.
[296:05.31]Something's going real fast over here.
[296:08.59]Fire, fire, fire, fire!
[296:24.65]Oh, so impatient.
[296:25.71]I'm gonna die because of my impatience.
[296:31.47]I can't fucking move.
[296:32.19]I don't even know where I am.
[296:36.82]I feel like that did no damage to him.
[296:49.79]Are there any more of those balls?
[296:52.20]I feel like one's going to come crashing through the wall here or something downstairs.
[296:55.16]I keep hearing it.
[296:55.76]I keep hearing the noise.
[297:04.55]Okay, I just did Super Mario Got a Star.
[297:09.31]Okay.
[297:18.28]I can't make this.
[297:19.06]It's over, man.
[297:19.70]I'm dead.
[297:23.03]Now, where do I go?
[297:24.33]I don't know where to go.
[297:25.21]We're gonna go back.
[297:32.75]Is this the right way?
[297:33.59]I don't think it is.
[297:34.56]I may have missed it!
[297:49.85]I thought that was gonna go up in straight ahead.
[297:52.63]Oh man.
[297:53.35]Oh, all right.
[297:55.45]I think, I think that's gonna be it for today.
[297:58.37]That was so close.
[298:10.98]Oh well.
[298:22.42]This place is fun.
[298:24.78]Okay, this place is really great.
[298:26.73]I love this place.
[298:30.75]This place is really jokey.
[298:41.64]Can I get a snake head?
[298:45.52]Shortcut's right there.
[298:46.40]Alright, I'll get it.
[298:47.18]Let's get it.
[298:59.50]Just give me the shortcut.
[299:01.08]And then I'll probably call it a night there.
[299:04.62]Wait for it.
[299:05.84]No, I'm not going to wait this one.
[299:10.04]Just don't even have to fight this guy.
[299:11.20]There's no reason to even attack him.
[299:12.36]He doesn't do anything.
[299:13.08]He just sleeps.
[299:20.52]Where's the ball?
[299:24.78]Where's the boulder?
[299:28.73]Why is the boulder not coming?
[299:33.59]Okay.
[299:39.47]Item right here.
[299:45.96]Showtoll.
[299:49.10]Oh, fuck.
[299:49.48]This is a whole other way to go.
[299:55.78]I have to go down here.
[299:58.28]Interesting.
[299:58.88]Okay.
[300:00.61]Oh, look who it is.
[300:01.87]It's him.
[300:02.89]It's the guy.
[300:03.45]I found him.
[300:05.55]Remember me?
[300:11.48]Did I get anything for hanging out with him?
[300:25.82]Hmm.
[300:27.60]Ah, so you see my plight.
[300:29.35]Yes, indeed.
[300:30.69]I have run up against a wall, or a ball, to be precise.
[300:34.55]I'm afraid I'm a bit too tough to be outrunning those things.
[300:38.95]So here I sit in quite a pickle.
[300:40.91]But who knows?
[300:42.75]Perhaps we'll have another development.
[300:47.19]So do I have to turn off the boulders so he can come up?
[300:50.12]Perhaps I could try some rolling.
[300:52.50]Bah, no chance.
[300:54.58]My head would spin.
[300:56.08]Hmm.
[300:57.62]Hmm.
[301:00.23]Okay.
[301:03.01]So, turn off the boulders so our friend can do it.
[301:09.30]We want to have our friend to be able to come with us.
[301:25.63]Yeah, they're gone.
[301:26.75]So shouldn't he be able to come up here now?
[301:32.47]Why would I kick him off?
[301:36.44]Okay.
[301:38.16]Almost there.
[301:40.16]Watch out for this.
[301:43.48]You know, thank God for that.
[301:46.76]That worked out pretty well.
[301:50.31]I outplayed that guy accidentally.
[301:54.63]You gotta take your victories, you know what I'm saying, guys?
[302:05.42]Alright.
[302:06.72]Just gotta make it up.
[302:11.93]Here we go.
[302:12.75]Gotta run up there.
[302:13.87]And get my souls first.
[302:18.69]Gotta be quick about this, and then it's bang a right.
[302:34.23]I made it.
[302:34.53]Alright, gotta turn this off.
[302:42.09]Turn the balls off.
[302:43.17]So he can come up here.
[302:47.47]Where's the lever to, like, pull the trigger and pull... Got it.
[302:51.69]Wait, what does this do?
[302:54.39]This shoots him a different way?
[303:07.73]I guess I'm shooting that way now.
[303:13.80]Snake down there.
[303:14.50]That's just a fall.
[303:38.10]So now that these are gone, we can keep going this way.
[303:44.74]Okay.
[303:48.72]Well, I can get the item if I fall from here.
[303:51.11]Alright.
[304:01.09]Large Soul of a Proud Knight.
[304:03.72]And then a couple of ways to go.
[304:08.49]Um... I don't know if I want to go this way yet.
[304:21.48]Nothing.
[304:26.16]Traps or anything?
[304:30.41]Gate's not gonna fall.
[304:33.45]Sorceries, shit.
[304:34.47]I don't really care.
[304:41.82]Hmm, a door.
[304:47.62]Is that some kind of skip or anything?
[304:49.06]Or no?
[304:49.60]I mean, I guess maybe it is?
[304:56.51]Where's this?
[305:01.89]Where the fuck am I going?
[305:05.03]Oh, shit.
[305:08.07]There's blood all over this.
[305:08.85]Do I get on it?
[305:11.21]I knew it.
[305:11.65]I shouldn't have gone on it.
[305:14.78]How do I get off?
[305:52.45]Thought you told me there were no mimics in this one Didn't you guys say that there weren't mimics I was looking I've that was a very obvious chest, but it wasn't breathing or anything It was so obvious, but I was told that there were no mimics we're like 12 hours into this game, and that's the first mimic I Did think about it, but then in my brain, I'm sitting okay.
[306:17.75]It's been like 12 hours.
[306:18.71]There's been no mimic for 12 hours.
[306:20.01]I
[306:21.62]Chests breathe?
[306:22.50]Did they take that out?
[306:23.99]Did they not breathe?
[306:31.05]Did they... Is that like a feature they added to make it seem easier for people?
[306:38.03]They do breathe.
[306:38.83]I was looking at it.
[306:54.69]Why would we not check anyway?
[306:56.15]Well, because there hasn't been a mimic for like 12 and a half hours.
[307:00.45]So I figured, alright.
[307:01.43]I didn't know it was going to instantly kill me.
[307:05.71]If it was, I thought it was going to bite me and I could have fought it or something.
[307:08.93]It instantly kills you.
[307:14.65]No, I gotta go.
[307:15.67]That's it.
[307:16.33]It's 1 o'clock in the morning.
[307:18.76]It's time to go to bed.
[307:21.89]Put on actual armor?
[307:22.91]Is this really causing me this much of a problem?
[307:24.59]It probably is.
[307:25.13]What a dummy.
[307:32.36]Alright, well, whatever.
[307:33.16]Time for bed.
[307:38.60]Thanks for hanging out.
[307:40.08]Holy shit, my arms are so red from pushing into the armchair.
[307:45.96]Armor doesn't matter.
[307:50.57]so um depending on the next actual stream is going to be tomorrow so I'm just we're gonna keep going tomorrow night and then depending on how we go from there we'll try to go through all of sen's fortress should be fun see you there see you tomorrow and now let's do the credits

[311:41.20]Keep it going, as they say.
[311:43.10]I'm having a blast.
[311:43.66]I think it's great.
[311:46.72]I think that this is probably, so far, I absolutely would put this over two.
[311:53.03]And depending on how much further we go here, I would probably put it over three as well.
[311:57.07]So far, I'm not sure though.
[311:58.73]We have to wait till we get more further into the game.
[312:03.35]But, bitwise, let's go.
[312:05.23]Let's do it.
[312:06.89]What do you say?
[312:10.43]Thank you.
[312:14.68]Oh, yeah.
[312:15.42]It got cut off here because I had to restart the stream.
[312:17.44]But, like, I just started.
[312:18.48]Yeah.
[312:21.40]You know how it works.
[312:22.58]Anyways, BasicFeral, thanks for the two bucks.
[312:24.44]I love Otto, and now seeing him, I gave bits.
[312:26.58]Hey, thank you.
[312:28.02]Spreo, thanks for the one dollar.
[312:29.26]Otto will be better streamer than you if he made a Twitch channel.
[312:33.02]Well, he's a dog.
[312:34.12]He can't.
[312:34.52]He's not a human.
[312:36.30]He would probably be pretty entertaining, though.
[312:39.38]Smellyboy11, thanks for the $1.
[312:41.02]Surima doesn't know how to eat over his plate.
[312:43.32]Proceeds to stain his nice shirt like a toddler.
[312:46.04]This is not a nice shirt.
[312:48.34]This shirt came out of a box.
[312:50.88]This was a... I think I got this shirt for free.
[312:54.24]Because I bought... Like, it was buy three, get one free.
[312:57.16]And this shirt was the free one.
[312:59.02]So this shirt was free.
[313:00.80]Hey, Wonderful Telephone, thanks for the $1.
[313:02.76]Should have named it Knee Deep in Remaster so you could stretch the content.
[313:07.63]Well, tomorrow is going to be... The title of the stream is going to be... Up to my armpits.
[313:13.43]And then in brackets, still safe.
[313:16.95]On the remaster.
[313:18.03]Like this.
[313:18.88]Because, you know, you're still safe.
[313:20.02]Remember your mother always told you... Don't go past your armpits in the ocean.
[313:24.68]Like this.
[313:42.11]That's the title tomorrow.
[313:44.31]You haven't heard that before?
[313:45.95]It was always, don't go over your armpits.
[313:50.25]Right, if you go past your armpits, then you're gonna get yelled at.
[313:52.74]But anyways, thank you.
[314:01.82]That's not safe.
[314:02.62]Yes, it is.
[314:04.00]You're up, you're still, your chest up is still fine.
[314:07.37]You can get away from monsters.
[314:11.83]But thank you, wonderful telephone.
[314:13.15]Again, for the $1.
[314:13.95]A Windows update breaking something preposterous, absolutely unheard of.
[314:19.42]The first hour of this stream, I wanted to seriously just put my upper lip down and bite up into my nose.
[314:29.61]Like, ugh.
[314:32.27]I get so tilted with technological problems that I can't fix.
[314:36.03]It drives me fucking crazy.
[314:37.97]Especially when it ruins a stream.
[314:40.47]I hate it.
[314:40.87]I hate everything about it.
[314:42.05]What do you mean, what?
[314:48.40]Like, I mean, like, I have a huge lower jaw and I like... And I bite down and up over into my nose.
[314:58.46]Thank you, Casey, for the $1.
[314:59.54]With election season coming up, I just want to remind that Dean Dingus sprangled three people.
[315:04.88]Brought to you by the Anthony Bantley Campaign for Congress.
[315:08.86]It's, you know, it's possible he did.
[315:10.45]I don't know.
[315:12.83]Thank you, Miguel Mean Green, for the $1.
[315:14.93]You sell fish.
[315:17.93]Um, I don't, I don't, but maybe somebody does.
[315:24.07]Fruit sucks.
[315:24.87]Thanks for the three, four, almost five dollars here.
[315:30.19]And you just say no message.
[315:32.09]Thank you for your multiple bit donations, dude.
[315:34.99]Appreciate it.
[315:37.03]Hydra725, thanks for the dollar.
[315:38.67]Eat Havel's rocky, chunky ass.
[315:41.79]I did.
[315:42.25]I beat him.
[315:44.61]I got him.
[315:46.49]Hey bro, look, thanks for the $1.
[315:47.57]Just update Windows.
[315:48.39]That should fix the game capture issue.
[315:50.73]See, that's the problem.
[315:51.53]I can't.
[315:53.35]When I update Windows, it goes to the update screen.
[315:57.00]And then the computer restarts and says, you can't do it.
[315:59.28]You need to restart.
[316:00.32]Windows needs to restart this computer to do your update.
[316:03.34]Okay, so I restart the computer.
[316:05.52]Windows needs to restart your computer to do this update.
[316:07.56]You need to restart.
[316:08.78]And it does that forever.
[316:09.60]And I looked it up and it's literally, I have to reset my whole computer.
[316:13.84]So, I cannot physically update my Windows.
[316:20.63]So, time to do a fresh reset wipe of my entire computer.
[316:25.67]It's gonna be a pain in the ass.
[316:31.54]Every time Jerma says, Havel, Windows updates one more time.
[316:40.69]Havel.
[316:43.70]Thank you, Brawlock.
[316:44.35]Thank you, Bob-Boy!
[316:45.17]For the one dollar, he gives a Microsoft support link.
[316:49.71]Yeah, I'm gonna check out all these... All these relative links.
[316:56.92]I just don't want to do it on stream.
[316:58.04]I didn't want to sit there and troubleshoot on stream.
[317:01.44]Nobody wants to watch that shit.
[317:04.35]Guy has computer bricked by Windows update.
[317:07.33]Let's sit here and listen to him complain about it for an hour.
[317:09.96]That's why I turned the stream off.
[317:11.30]And just came back when it was ready to be streamed, you know?
[317:15.02]I don't want to... That's not like... I don't think that's interesting content.
[317:17.54]I think it's like annoying content.
[317:20.28]As much as it might be like funny for like a few minutes, it's annoying to like just stream that.
[317:24.91]Wait, I need to click on this.
[317:26.07]They just patch.
[317:27.37]Hold on.
[317:27.73]I'll be back in an hour.
[317:31.03]You'll watch it?
[317:33.79]Yeah, I just don't like streaming that kind of stuff.
[317:41.85]I want it.
[317:45.05]But thank you, Bobboy, for the links.
[317:48.06]Appreciate it.
[317:49.66]I will definitely take a look at all these relative links.
[317:52.75]Uh, StixRenegade, thanks for the one dollar.
[317:54.45]Destroy your computer, write down all your reviewers' addresses, buy a camera and 10,000 SD cards, record yourself playing Dark Souls to the SD card, send the SD card to a viewer, repeat for all your viewers.
[318:06.06]Or even better, write a letter to all your viewers detailing how your play session went.
[318:09.31]Or even better, just visit all your streamers and play at their house.
[318:16.47]Wow, you're really inflating my view counts here.
[318:18.87]10,000 SD cards.
[318:22.05]10,000 concurrent viewers?
[318:22.79]I'm not sure we've ever gotten that high.
[318:26.81]Thanks for the ego boost.
[318:35.00]Thank you, Bobboy, again for the $1.
[318:36.54]Have you tried my snack suggestion with the Newman O's?
[318:39.90]I have not.
[318:41.18]I have not really been to the grocery store to buy...
[318:45.61]Like Oreos or anything like that.
[318:49.69]Actually, I need to go grocery shopping.
[318:50.81]Thanks for reminding me to go grocery shopping.
[318:55.31]Because now I have to.
[318:57.13]Thank you, Boozy Cat, for the $5.
[318:58.21]I feel like Microsoft should understand many people's jobs are on their computer.
[319:02.94]And anything that forces shutdown or complete wipe screws them up professionally.
[319:07.16]Sorry to hear about all the problems you've been having.
[319:09.86]Love you as always.
[319:10.84]Thank you, Boozy Cat.
[319:13.46]Yeah, I will never understand why there's not two versions.
[319:15.44]I don't understand why.
[319:20.75]It's... There should be... And look, I'm not saying that I'm... I need this version of Windows Professional.
[319:28.13]I want the Windows... I'm a professional, so I get the Windows Professional version.
[319:33.46]But I feel like it needs to exist.
[319:36.32]Strip away all the stupid... There's a couple of words here that I could use.
[319:43.15]And it's going to make your grandmother angry.
[319:45.73]It's going to make your mother probably angry.
[319:47.46]It'll make probably your cousin that doesn't use computers angry.
[319:51.88]But when you lump everybody together, you got, like you said, you got a guy, maybe you got a guy that's doing coding on that computer.
[320:02.03]Maybe somebody's doing heavily intensive editing on that computer.
[320:05.07]That person's not going to use ever
[320:10.89]Ever.
[320:12.11]And I mean fucking ever.
[320:15.69]The Cortana.
[320:18.31]It's never going to happen.
[320:20.07]It will never fucking happen.
[320:25.06]I used it one time for a joke.
[320:28.72]No one will use it.
[320:33.43]If you want that in your operating system and you want that to, like, make your cousin fucking think it's cool and check the weather with your voice, okay, that's fine.
[320:43.75]I don't fucking want it.
[320:46.37]Give me a core shell of Windows that's a secure system.
[320:52.61]That's light, fast, and has no bloatware in it.
[320:56.73]Is it really that hard to do?
[320:58.39]I will pay extra for it.
[320:59.51]I don't care if you put the fucking Windows Professional Enterprise version.
[321:04.21]I'll buy it.
[321:05.33]Just don't give me the fucking Cortana Cloud bullshit that nobody wants.
[321:12.96]Install Linux, it's all those things.
[321:15.08]I would love Linux, but nobody makes programs for Linux.
[321:19.51]Linux runs into the wall of, you know, I never want to run into a situation where it has to happen every time I open a program.
[321:27.29]Does this run on Linux?
[321:29.43]I don't want to ask that question every three days.
[321:32.54]That's the problem.
[321:36.98]Half of the programs that I use probably don't even work on Linux.
[321:40.80]Some of them probably do, but... Drivers are the real problem for Linux?
[321:45.57]Right.
[321:48.12]Literally Windows 7.
[321:49.34]Oh yeah, Windows 7 is an unbelievable operating system.
[321:52.52]It's the best one they've ever made.
[321:53.44]I just... Why not just take the Windows 7 operating system and just... Like, just make it like 7.2.
[322:06.60]You don't have to lump everybody into Windows 10 or Windows 8 like they tried to do.
[322:11.09]Remember when they did Windows 8.1?
[322:14.19]They should just make a Windows 7.1, or just call Windows 7, Windows, uh, Classic.
[322:21.04]And just keep it secure, keep it updated, and make sure that it's compatible.
[322:33.12]I hate this new fucking dumb trend of we have to lump every single person together, whether they're a professional or not.
[322:43.14]Whether they're an enthusiast or not.
[322:46.26]The same features, the same annoying shit is in all of them.
[322:50.74]And then they run into all these problems with they push out hundreds of these updates for all these random fucking features and half these computers just get like bricked by them.
[323:09.69]Calm down, grandpa.
[323:13.09]No, it's true.
[323:13.73]It's the same thing with Apple.
[323:16.39]My iPhone 4 was a lightning fast, incredible device that did exactly what I wanted it to do.
[323:25.02]I could browse the internet.
[323:26.22]Fucking lightning fast.
[323:27.12]I could open up an app and it would be open in two seconds.
[323:29.52]I could do my maps.
[323:30.74]I could go with a GPS.
[323:31.88]I could text.
[323:33.16]I could take a picture, right?
[323:35.74]They have... Apple is so shit and so slow
[323:40.48]These new Apple phones, iPhone 6, iPhone fucking 10, they're loaded with such like heavy dog shit that it weighs the whole phone down.
[323:53.30]I loved that little fucking lightning fast phone.
[324:04.71]My university implemented some of the connection with Cortana, so now I get a prompt asking for a sign-in when I type into my search bar.
[324:15.45]I don't understand.
[324:16.37]Who are they marketing that to?
[324:18.13]Who is that for?
[324:19.07]I don't know who these design choices are for.
[324:29.69]More power, less furls.
[324:31.03]Exactly.
[324:31.98]You can give me a better processor, but I don't want the stuff that I'll never use.
[324:36.74]It weighs the phone down.
[324:37.58]It makes the phone lag.
[324:38.68]It drops calls.
[324:39.68]It fucks it up.
[324:40.32]It makes storage a pain in the ass.
[324:48.59]Looks good to the shareholders that there's more shit.
[324:53.23]Whatever it is, it truly just sucks.
[325:03.56]But regardless, we will move on.
[325:07.37]I just wish that there was more bare bones or more stripped of unnecessary features, operating systems and telephones.
[325:18.87]I just don't know why we keep loading shit into the cake.
[325:22.23]A chocolate cake tastes great.
[325:23.97]You don't have to put grenadine on it and slather it in olive oil and then bake it and then take it out and rebake it and then add another layer.
[325:33.17]Just give me a chocolate cake.
[325:34.11]I love chocolate cake.
[325:35.01]I want to eat it.
[325:35.71]I don't want you to put anything on it.
[325:37.65]Frosting, chocolate cake, and maybe a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
[325:41.73]Don't give me that olive oil fucking bullshit.
[325:44.95]Don't cover it in olive oil.
[325:47.01]No one's going to want to eat it.
[325:48.72]Maybe like three people will eat it and pretend to like it.
[325:52.84]Oh, that's really interesting flavor profile.
[325:57.15]I really like it.
[325:58.23]It tastes great.
[326:01.87]Nobody wants to eat it.
[326:05.33]But anyways.
[326:07.39]Thank you to Broluck for the $1.
[326:11.03]Yeah, it's normal.
[326:11.83]A lot of people take their anger out on their close loved ones.
[326:14.89]Glad I can be your punching bag.
[326:18.19]I was never mad at you guys.
[326:20.05]I never got angry at you guys.
[326:21.69]I was angry at my computer son over here.
[326:27.76]Android device with custom ROMs?
[326:30.58]I might have to look into that.
[326:32.14]Because I'm really getting sick of technology.
[326:34.52]Sucking.
[326:39.54]But Casey, thanks for the $1 with election season.
[326:42.74]Why is that showing up again?
[326:43.52]I don't know.
[326:44.94]Hey, acknowledge John.
[326:46.14]Thanks for the $2.
[326:47.97]Just shooting over some bits to help replace the controller, you'll probably end up breaking by the end of the stream.
[326:53.61]Thanks for the two bucks, John, but... This is solid.
[326:58.52]We're good.
[327:00.44]I don't break controllers, because I have to replace them, so I don't want to do that.
[327:04.24]I don't break controllers, I don't break monitors, I don't break equipment, because after you're done with your rage, you gotta go back to Target and buy another one.
[327:14.03]No, I like to squeeze my hands.
[327:15.77]I put the controller down.
[327:16.65]You've probably heard it like three or four times.
[327:18.12]Controller goes down.
[327:19.50]And then I just squeeze my hands together and go... I've never broken a keyboard intentionally.
[327:27.61]I dropped liquids in it.
[327:29.39]Accidentally.
[327:31.98]Smash my desk.
[327:32.72]I mean, I put my hands down like it's a solid wood desk.
[327:35.47]Nothing's gonna break here.
[327:36.73]This thing is solid.
[327:39.47]This desk is probably 700 pounds.
[327:41.81]Just this part up here.
[327:42.81]Just the top.
[327:43.33]This is probably a 1600 pound desk.
[327:50.17]I broke my keyboard twice, not because I smashed it, but because I dropped liquids in it.
[327:55.97]Because I drank on my desk and I dropped fucking liquids on it.
[327:59.22]I didn't like smash it out of anger.
[328:07.15]I don't break equipment, because you have to replace it.
[328:09.73]No.
[328:09.95]Thank you, The Jack, for the $2.
[328:18.63]Seems good.
[328:19.17]Windows 10.
[328:20.85]Long-term servicing branch.
[328:22.98]That's the version of Windows with no Windows Store, no Cortana, no Edge, only security updates.
[328:28.76]Windows doesn't want you to know about it.
[328:31.98]Because they want you to buy their shitty apps and bloatware.
[328:36.31]What the fuck is this?
[328:37.17]Windows 10 LTSB?
[328:39.09]Is this real?
[328:42.25]Why won't they tell me about this?
[328:46.21]This is real?
[328:48.91]Windows 10 LTSB.
[329:00.56]Why can't I get this?
[329:02.50]Why wasn't this at the store?
[329:05.51]Windows 10 has 12 editions.
[329:09.65]Why would you, why do you have 12 editions?
[329:13.47]Home, pro, enterprise, education, pro, education, enterprise, LTSB, mobile, enterprise, mobile, IOT, S mode, team, pro for workstations.
[329:23.15]They just pretend to do things to make, to have employees and have money.
[329:26.88]That doesn't make any sense.
[329:29.42]None of these are real.
[329:30.68]They have whole branches of entire sectors of Microsoft that make pretend operating systems.
[329:48.13]Oh, here's the problem.
[329:51.87]Here's the issue.
[329:53.89]I can't buy that because it's a volume license.
[329:57.38]I have to buy probably like 50 to 100 copies to get that.
[330:02.96]Because it's part of their volume licensing.
[330:07.40]Because that's an organizational edition.
[330:13.05]These editions add features to facilitate centralized control of many installations of the OS.
[330:17.73]The main avenue of acquiring them is a volume license through Microsoft.
[330:21.63]And that's the Enterprise, the Education, Enterprise LTSB, and Mobile Enterprise.
[330:28.26]Alright, are we pulling our money together?
[330:29.40]You guys wanna, like, get this?
[330:30.46]Like, do 100 of you guys want this?
[330:33.10]Should I do, like, a giveaway?
[330:35.38]Imagine if I did a Microsoft Windows LTSB giveaway.
[330:39.46]Just so I could get the volume license so I could get this version.
[330:46.16]That shit's gonna cost, like, fucking 10 grand.
[330:49.77]No, that's not gonna happen.
[330:52.35]You guys would have to be employees of mine.
[330:56.49]Okay, so we need the names, addresses, and social security numbers of all your employees getting this stuff.
[331:02.00]Ah.
[331:03.20]Anybody in chat willing to give me their social?
[331:07.52]But anyways.
[331:08.72]I did not know that existed, but that's stupid that you have to do it.
[331:11.34]It's a volume license.
[331:13.61]I probably have to call and talk to like 15 different people to get that.
[331:17.09]That's not like at the store.
[331:20.41]Fucking Microsoft, man.
[331:21.73]Yeah, give me 12 versions of Windows 10.
[331:27.34]It's just fake companies.
[331:31.27]To make sure that they can have like 28,000 employees.
[331:35.53]To make sure that they can have like 12 different fucking versions of something.
[331:41.19]Holy shit.
[331:46.33]Thank you bro luck for the $1.
[331:47.21]It's a clip.
[331:48.31]Let's see what it is.
[331:53.89]I think I don't understand number 1.
[331:58.52]Oh, this is when the Windows update thing popped up.
[332:03.81]You know what's funny?
[332:05.81]If I was game capturing, you would not have seen that.
[332:09.05]So, the one silver lining to this stream, me having to do desktop capture, was you got to see the actual pop-up on the monitor.
[332:18.47]Get away from me!
[332:26.66]That's where the meltdown starts.
[332:27.90]Oh, yeah, I could smell it.
[332:29.42]I could feel it.
[332:32.54]I could feel that meltdown.
[332:35.02]Hey, thank you MightyWaffle for the $1.
[332:36.40]Hey, FutureJerma reading this.
[332:37.48]I'm glad you calmed down.
[332:38.50]Hey, thanks.
[332:39.88]Sometimes you gotta let it out.
[332:41.60]CleverCactus, thanks for the $1.
[332:42.96]Streamer blames Microsoft for lack of skill.
[332:45.07]That's not true.
[332:47.25]That's not true.
[332:48.17]Microsoft wronged me and I was upset about it.
[332:51.57]That's not true.
[332:55.96]Hey, Miguel, Mean Green, thanks for the $1.
[332:57.98]Boundary of the Toundry.
[332:59.56]What does that mean?
[333:02.64]I don't know.
[333:08.04]It's true.
[333:08.64]That's not true!
[333:11.23]I had to lower my performance by like 30%.
[333:14.27]Were you here two days ago?
[333:17.31]Did you see how much fun we had two days ago?
[333:20.76]Look, after like the first 30 minutes, I had a lot of fun, right?
[333:23.98]But that was a completely different start of that stream.
[333:27.24]I didn't say a goddamn thing about performance, because it was perfect.
[333:30.82]And then fast forward two days later, and I'm having fucking performance issues.
[333:35.64]And, come on.
[333:37.44]I was justified to be angry tonight.
[333:44.27]I will justify that angry.
[333:56.05]I have more tech problems than all your friends?
[334:00.27]You can't blame Microsoft?
[334:01.33]But that doesn't make any sense!
[334:04.51]That's like saying... Come on.
[334:06.54]That's like saying... Hey, you know, dude, uh, you know, I've never been in a car accident before, but... I mean, why?
[334:11.66]Like, you got in a car accident?
[334:12.96]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[334:14.30]Why did somebody run into you at a red light?
[334:16.80]None of my friends have ever been in a car accident.
[334:19.35]Why'd you get in a car accident?
[334:24.15]If somebody hits me in a fucking red light, what am I supposed to do about that?
[334:33.32]You get in a car accident every two weeks.
[334:35.86]What am I supposed to do about it?
[334:37.26]I don't have any... I don't do anything.
[334:40.86]I don't do anything to make these problems happen.
[334:45.87]This computer is fucking new.
[334:48.15]It's a new computer that was custom built.
[334:52.97]You know, I didn't just buy this at Walmart.
[335:10.42]You don't update for two months until an hour before the stream?
[335:12.88]That didn't happen!
[335:13.78]I just started last night!
[335:19.06]So, you understand that... Why on Earth...
[335:23.70]Would I ever sit down here and think, oh, I wonder if the update that I did last night bricked my computer.
[335:31.28]Why would that ever happen?
[335:32.64]Why would I ever think that that was going to happen?
[335:35.50]Yeah, I had to restart my computer a couple times.
[335:37.52]I have a bunch of updates.
[335:39.70]This is going to brick my computer.
[335:41.36]I'm positive.
[335:42.40]Let me do a test stream, but I can't do a test stream because I have to open OBS and run it.
[335:58.49]The thing with computers is sometimes this shit just happens.
[336:05.02]Especially the stuff that's completely out of my control.
[336:06.84]Like the internet problems, right?
[336:08.32]There is absolutely nothing I can do about that.
[336:13.42]If you want to add those to my problems that I'm having, that's unfair.
[336:18.13]Because there's nothing that can be done about that.
[336:22.63]I can't call Mr. Comcast and demand my internet work.
[336:27.70]I can't.
[336:28.33]It's impossible.
[336:30.33]That's out of my control.
[336:39.09]And now it's like, well, why don't you just move?
[336:41.29]What do you think I'm doing?
[336:42.29]I'm trying to get the fuck out of here as fast as possible.
[336:45.24]It's not easy to move.
[336:47.66]I gotta move all my shit.
[336:49.36]My whole life has to move.
[337:07.77]I don't have a crystal ball.
[337:08.85]I can't determine whether or not I'm gonna have a problem or not.
[337:15.09]If I turn my computer on one day... Let's say I have to stream tomorrow, right?
[337:20.23]So I'm streaming tomorrow.
[337:21.95]And... Let's say, like, what happened before.
[337:24.71]My memory went bad.
[337:26.39]A few months ago.
[337:27.25]Remember that?
[337:29.71]Why... Why would I ever... Just be like... You know, today's the day I'm gonna run a memory test.
[337:37.68]I better do that.
[337:38.28]I better do like a mem test right now.
[337:40.76]What the fuck would I ever do that?
[337:41.96]Doesn't make any sense.
[337:47.39]Computers are so complicated that it's impossible to know when they're going to have problems.
[337:52.79]And I don't know, maybe like people, maybe the place where I've been getting my computer is a piece of shit and they're not making it properly and they're not running the proper tests on it.
[338:00.86]I think that's possible because I've had problems with a company before that made it.
[338:08.53]Buying new RAM must be tough.
[338:12.46]That problem isn't even here anymore because I dealt with it after it happened.
[338:28.70]It's my job to have a functioning computer.
[338:35.77]What would you have me do, okay?
[338:39.80]If memory, if my memory goes bad and my stream turns off, what would you want me to do?
[338:46.47]Fix the problem when it happens, right?
[338:48.27]Because that, I don't, I can't, how am I supposed to know it's going to happen?
[338:58.36]Obviously, when I have a problem, then I have to go, I have to go fix it.
[339:08.58]Get more than to get two computers Buy spare computer parts in advance of failure But that's so that is so just That is so impractical I
[339:38.10]And yes, I do get very unlucky with this shit.
[339:40.61]I do.
[339:54.40]Whatever.
[340:08.84]Can't wait to get canceled streams because of brownouts and droughts.
[340:11.48]Because I'm moving to the desert.
[340:19.81]Like, that's another thing, right?
[340:22.49]I'm just one guy.
[340:25.22]If I have a bunch of problems, I need to figure them out.
[340:29.50]I'm not like, I don't have like five people doing shit for me.
[340:34.98]I don't have, like, oh, you know, like, I need my computer fixed in, like, 12 hours.
[340:39.16]I need to figure out fucking how to do that.
[340:55.31]I have to have a computer built into my chest.
[341:01.68]When I run into a problem, I have to figure out how to fix it.
[341:05.86]I can't prepare to run into a problem because there's no way for me to know that it's ever going to happen.
[341:12.04]It's impossible.
[341:14.62]When I bought Red Dead Redemption on the Microsoft Store and it wouldn't let me play the game, what would you want me to do?
[341:57.89]Don't buy it and download it live on stream.
[341:59.85]I bought a physical copy!
[342:01.11]At least I tried to.
[342:03.37]Alright, I'm just gonna move on, because, like, it doesn't matter what I say.
[342:10.23]Like, yes, I do run into a lot of problems, but half of those problems are stuff that I, I, I, there's nothing I can do about it.
[342:17.10]And if I'm gonna get shit for having, like, problems with my internet, and problems with, like, my computer that I could never foresee coming, like, memory dying, internet issues, like, that's just not fucking fair.
[342:27.76]It's not.
[342:30.55]I'm just gonna be real.
[342:31.15]I'm just gonna be completely real.
[342:33.01]If my stream goes down because of my internet, and people are angry with me, like, give me a break.
[342:37.07]Come on.
[342:38.11]What do you want me to say?
[342:49.40]That's just not fair.
[342:55.22]What can I say?
[343:19.68]Anyways, thank you to Stompy for the bits.
[343:25.25]Mighty Waffle for the bits.
[343:32.35]Hey Germ, I made this dumb Germ or Earth bootleg and I thought I'd share this monstrosity with you.
[343:38.62]I blame the Discord and I'm sorry.
[343:40.12]Let's see what it is.
[343:44.27]It's got nice teeth, that's for sure.
[343:59.18]It's beautiful, actually.
[344:08.53]It's a cursed image.
[344:11.19]Thank you, Sleepy Pigeon, for the $1.
[344:12.46]Hey, Germa, are you celebrating Garfield's 40th birthday today?
[344:17.78]Is Garfield going to die in canon?
[344:19.30]I hope he is.
[344:22.44]When he gets to be like 60, hopefully they end it.
[344:26.25]End the Garfield comics forever when he gets to like 75.
[344:28.13]Have him like... choke on lasagna.
[344:45.12]That's horrible.
[344:52.63]Thank you.
[344:53.01]Thank you, Sleepy Pigeon, for the $1.
[344:54.37]Hey, Germa.
[344:55.15]That was the same person.
[344:55.98]Sorry.
[344:57.32]Son of Genoma, thanks for the $1.
[344:58.34]Hey, Germa, my friend Mika, who likes your videos, is feeling sad lately for some personal issues.
[345:02.54]Could you send her and her rat Marta some love?
[345:06.86]Absolutely.
[345:11.03]Mika, hope...
[345:13.67]Hope you're not feeling sad still.
[345:14.95]Because that was earlier tonight, but whatever personal issues you're going through, hopefully you can solve them.
[345:22.94]Much love to you and your rat.
[345:24.96]Speaking of rats, I was at the pet store and I saw these two rats.
[345:30.02]They never have rats at this pet store, but they were there today.
[345:33.88]They were so cute.
[345:34.92]And it said, specifically on the bottom, it said, they are very smart and they can learn their names.
[345:41.15]I was like, holy shit, I need these.
[345:43.65]They're like $14.
[345:45.93]They're so cheap and they're so perfect.
[346:01.50]But hopefully, Mika, you feel better.
[346:05.07]Much love to you.
[346:06.81]And Son of Jenova as well.
[346:07.93]Thank you for the $1.
[346:08.83]Thank you Brainwashed for the $3.
[346:12.03]Sick.
[346:13.53]Go, go, go, go, go.
[346:16.75]Thank you Lange for the $5.
[346:18.46]Hi, Jeremy.
[346:21.06]I arrived at SGDQ venue today.
[346:23.60]Wait, hold on.
[346:24.14]Hold on.
[346:24.36]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[346:25.02]Wait a minute.
[346:25.50]This is Lange.
[346:25.84]It's Lange.
[346:26.14]Lange.
[346:34.42]Lang.
[346:35.04]Why did I... I'm a fucking idiot.
[346:38.65]Lang gang!
[346:40.17]Lang gang!
[346:42.59]Hey, Lang.
[346:45.27]I arrived at SGDQ venue, first one.
[346:47.89]I'm very tired and have a long two weeks ahead of me.
[346:50.49]Thanks for streaming, it's helping me to unwind a bit.
[346:53.33]If you don't know Lang... He's actually... Yeah, look at this.
[346:57.56]There's the emote.
[346:59.66]He's doing work on SGDQ.
[347:01.66]He does a lot for those venues.
[347:06.37]So, good to see you around, man.
[347:08.07]Hopefully, uh... I'm actually... When does that start?
[347:10.15]I'm looking forward to that.
[347:15.83]Lang the Man.
[347:16.51]There he is.
[347:20.07]They do a lot of cool shit.
[347:22.19]So, definitely watch it.
[347:26.37]But, hopefully you relax, Lang, if you're still here.
[347:30.41]Hey, Ivory, thanks for the $1 to my favorite streamer.
[347:32.29]Thanks so much for all that you do.
[347:33.29]Listening to your streams and wacky antics really helps with my work-from-home job.
[347:37.93]And genuinely, I look forward to whatever game you play.
[347:40.96]We had a small hiccup earlier this evening, but still had a lot of great moments.
[347:46.52]Thank you.
[347:49.58]Appreciate it.
[347:52.35]Thank you so much.
[347:52.95]Uh... Dark Souls... I'm having a blast.
[347:57.69]Dark Souls Remastered is awesome.
[348:01.63]Thank you, Broluck, for the $1, and it's my Ethereum address.
[348:05.26]If you want a potential alternative to bits, there's my Ether address, thank you.
[348:10.60]Hey Mateo, thanks for the $5.
[348:11.82]Let me explain my $100 joke from Sunday.
[348:17.37]German, when I grow up, I want to be like you, famous and popular enough to be potentially a target for a sa- What?
[348:26.37]No, don't say that.
[348:29.79]Don't say that.
[348:32.23]Oh, God.
[348:38.35]Why would you... You don't wanna... Don't... No.
[348:40.97]No.
[348:41.41]Thank you.
[348:42.11]Thank... Oh, my God.
[348:47.72]You're gonna, like, scare the shit out of me.
[348:52.40]Thank you, Pilius Pryor, for the $1.
[348:53.68]No, uh, no, uh... No message?
[348:59.72]Thank you, Pilius.
[349:02.06]Thank you, Tar Alacrin, for the $1.
[349:04.72]Hey, Jerma, I know by the time you read this, the Quelaag fight will be long behind you, but I wanted to ask you if you knew the words lava or magma, because you only ever use the word fire to describe what is coming out of the spider's mouth.
[349:17.15]Watch.
[349:17.89]Which was clearly lava.
[349:22.69]Uh... Sure.
[349:25.37]I'm gonna say yes.
[349:26.79]Yes.
[349:28.95]To answer your question, yes.
[349:33.48]They're all hot, don't matter.
[349:36.70]Hyperion Fowl, thanks for the $1.
[349:38.38]Easy!
[349:38.82]That's right.
[349:41.64]Easy.
[349:44.48]Thank you PanMan again for the 50 bucks.
[349:46.36]You give me the ceaseless discharge, whatever he said.
[349:49.94]Thank you.
[349:51.66]We touched upon it earlier, but thank you so much, dude, for the $50.
[349:53.78]That's a lot of money.
[349:55.08]I should have just said hot stuff.
[350:03.80]Believe Blood, thanks for the one dollar.
[350:05.48]Football.
[350:06.02]I don't really watch.
[350:12.54]But, hopefully your team did well.
[350:15.47]Hyperion Fowl, thanks for the one dollar.
[350:16.83]Don't die.
[350:17.47]I hope I didn't, because I would have been probably pretty pissed.
[350:23.09]Albtram69, thanks for the three bucks.
[350:30.01]Whatever you do, do not talk to the big snake at Firelink Shrine.
[350:33.32]Talking to him once will render the good ending unavailable.
[350:37.26]I think that might be too late.
[350:38.68]I think I already did that.
[350:42.78]Thank you, Hyperion.
[350:43.56]Follow for the three bucks.
[350:44.38]Don't die again.
[350:47.15]I'll try not to.
[350:49.95]Jim Kana.
[350:50.81]Thanks for the one dollar here.
[350:52.19]They say Kappa Demon.
[350:53.37]It's about the Twitch way.
[350:58.55]Thank you.
[351:00.22]Nightfang, thanks for the $1.
[351:01.38]Hey, Jerma, can you give me any tips on how to lose weight and to stay healthy?
[351:04.66]I need to lose 60 pounds I gained over the course of two years thanks to college so that I can limit my chances of getting diabetes.
[351:12.12]I've been exercising more and drinking lots of water for the past few months, and I've decided that it's time to go on a diet.
[351:18.86]Um...
[351:25.15]For weight loss, I really don't... I don't know much about weight loss.
[351:28.79]Because I never had to do it.
[351:31.55]I was always way too skinny and I needed to gain weight.
[351:33.65]I never needed to lose weight.
[351:35.83]So... I can't... I don't know if I have very much good advice for staying healthy and losing weight.
[351:42.34]But... You sound like you're on the right track.
[351:47.96]Exercising more drinking more water stay away from just try to cut sugar out of your diet Processed foods out of your diet.
[351:55.22]It's just gonna it's not gonna help you at all You need to do cardio and you don't just you don't want to be taken in a bunch of refined and processed sugars and stuff Yeah sugar bad sugar bad
[352:17.82]Hopefully you can lose the weight.
[352:19.95]Even if you do just a little bit, it's still progress.
[352:23.43]One thing that's really important is you need to lose 60 pounds.
[352:28.10]Try to lose like five.
[352:30.64]Shoot...
[352:32.20]Sneezing back there.
[352:33.64]Try to lose like 5 to 10 pounds.
[352:36.24]Have that be the goal.
[352:37.86]Because a lot of people, they put this huge goal in front of them and they're like, I need to lose 100 pounds.
[352:42.68]And they don't lose 100 pounds really quickly and it kind of pisses them off.
[352:47.23]So give yourself a goal of instead of 60, do 5 or 6.
[352:49.53]7.
[352:49.67]You know?
[352:55.59]But thank you though.
[352:56.45]Good luck to you.
[352:58.46]Thank you, Mighty Waffle, for the $1.
[353:00.00]Your weight loss tips suck.
[353:01.08]Also, happy 40th birthday to Garfield.
[353:03.12]How would you know?
[353:04.81]You were waiting for me to read it.
[353:11.15]Thank you, Tar Alacrin, again, for the $1.
[353:13.19]Gerber, the low framerate is creating the experience of the original version.
[353:16.61]This is what we all had to go through.
[353:18.05]Stop complaining and take your lumps.
[353:21.33]No, it's the remastered version.
[353:23.07]I'm supposed to have a better experience than the one from 2011.
[353:26.24]That's why I bought it.
[353:31.32]That was the point of the purchase.
[353:37.65]Thank you, uh... Thank you, where are we?
[353:41.51]Bougie.
[353:42.01]Thank you, Fugigo, for $1.
[353:45.11]Twitch lets me watch ads for bits.
[353:48.35]Well, thank you for giving them to me.
[353:51.01]You have a lot of choices on this website.
[353:52.57]Thank you.
[353:54.85]Thank you, Captain Morgan, for the $1.
[353:57.09]The Game of Rebellion marches closer, Jerma.
[353:58.83]The Knights of Bottom text...
[354:00.91]will soon siege Chad headquarters in Vegas, and we need your help.
[354:04.93]It is no coincidence that fate has guided you to the deserts of the American Southwest, as the ancient gamer spirit of Jex has chosen you to be his harbinger of punishment.
[354:14.37]To aid us in our assault, you must entice the local populace in Vegas to begin the great yiffening as proposed Torfold foretold.
[354:22.97]Only then will we have our... What are you talking about?
[354:25.29]What is this?
[354:26.39]Thank you, Atari29, for the one, two, three, four, five dollars here in total.
[354:32.24]Thank you so much.
[354:34.36]Appreciate it.
[354:35.86]Bobboy, thanks for the dollar.
[354:36.96]Stay calm.
[354:37.36]It's just a game.
[354:37.92]It's a stupid game.
[354:38.70]It's rigged.
[354:39.20]We love you.
[354:41.68]No, I know.
[354:42.04]It's part of... I love this game.
[354:43.26]This game's incredible.
[354:45.67]Hey, Broluck, thanks for the one dollar.
[354:46.95]Just give up.
[354:49.83]Oh, this is when you guys were screaming at me about the bonfire.
[354:55.17]Thank you.
[355:00.21]It's hard to not tilt somebody in these games.
[355:01.55]It's impossible.
[355:01.97]But I'm going to do it anyways.
[355:02.78]I'm going to just do me, right?
[355:03.92]I think that was a pretty good one.
[355:31.99]Sputa, thanks for the five bucks.
[355:33.86]I got a part-time job and pays pretty well, so I plan to donate to you a lot this summer.
[355:37.58]You're the only person that makes me laugh as hard as I do anymore and I appreciate what you do.
[355:43.52]Well, Sputa, thank you for five dollars.
[355:48.17]You do you before you think about me.
[355:53.69]Don't donate to me just because you think you have to.
[355:58.78]Only do that if you are able to and you really, really want to.
[356:02.34]There's no obligation for you to pay me a bunch of your paycheck.
[356:06.15]So take care of yourself first.
[356:09.21]And if you have anything left over, then you decide what you want to do with it.
[356:13.31]But please take care of yourself first.
[356:15.05]Don't just get a part-time job to pay me, please.
[356:17.73]I hope, you know, that you save a lot of your money.
[356:20.25]Save your money.
[356:20.75]Thank you.
[356:26.70]But, congratulations on the, uh, on the job.
[356:30.65]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[356:31.79]That a boy, Jeremy.
[356:32.63]You finally get to be the big boy.
[356:35.99]It's been a long time.
[356:39.40]Thank you, Lupin Koopa, or Lupin Koopin, for the $3.
[356:42.24]Lucky is a Jerma clone.
[356:43.02]What?
[356:43.20]Who's Lucky?
[356:53.65]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[356:54.49]The Germ of Fire link gets put out at about the time you are going to a completely separate area of the game where you unlock Spoiler in Spoiler.
[357:04.02]Oh, okay.
[357:04.86]Well, interesting.
[357:09.01]Hey, Tar!
[357:10.39]Alacrin for the two bucks.
[357:11.33]Thank you, Tar.
[357:13.63]I'm trying this time.
[357:14.23]I'm really trying.
[357:14.73]Have you noticed?
[357:15.27]Have you noticed I'm really trying?
[357:16.53]And I still probably... I'm still probably getting it wrong.
[357:39.34]Snakes renegade.
[357:39.86]Thanks for the $1.
[357:40.52]Snakes aren't people.
[357:41.46]Excuse me.
[357:42.04]First you say androids, now, uh, scalios.
[357:45.74]They're not fucking humans.
[357:47.08]They're not people.
[357:47.78]They're snakes.
[357:53.96]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[357:55.18]Accordion Joke brought me back from Dozenov.
[357:57.31]Hey, welcome back.
[357:59.89]Thank you again, Sir Feline, for the $1.
[358:01.49]Armor upgrades absolutely matter.
[358:02.97]These people have no clue.
[358:04.43]Shaking my head.
[358:05.69]Okay.
[358:06.61]Well, we'll go from there.
[358:10.26]Hey, Maxie!
[358:11.08]Thank you, Maxie, for the five bucks.
[358:12.92]Welcome back.
[358:14.36]I'm going to end up missing your stream for the next couple of days because I'm off on a business trip.
[358:18.72]But if the timing permits, I'll be streaming you from my hotel room.
[358:21.95]If not, use these bits to remember me by until I come back.
[358:25.63]I left dinner in the oven.
[358:27.75]Love ya.
[358:29.88]Have fun on your business trip.
[358:32.84]Maybe we'll see you via the hotel room.
[358:35.14]Thanks, Mitch.
[358:38.65]Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $1.
[358:39.91]So you don't get fooled mimics again.
[358:43.11]If the end of the chain is pointing towards you, it's safe.
[358:45.29]If it's curved away, it's a mimic.
[358:48.09]Thank you for that tip that I will absolutely forget by tomorrow afternoon.
[358:51.53]Thank you.
[358:53.79]Thank you, Sir Feline, for the $1.
[358:55.19]Dropped liquids in it.
[358:56.13]Yeah, you dropped liquid in the keyboard because you knocked liquid onto it in a fit of unadulterated rage.
[359:01.37]But my... I wasn't trying to break the keyboard, though.
[359:03.53]I was not trying to break it.
[359:04.81]I was trying to... Nothing, you know?
[359:07.01]Never mind.
[359:08.15]Thank you, Hey, I'm Badger, for the $1.
[359:09.61]I just got fired from Subway.
[359:12.12]I'm sorry to hear that, dude.
[359:17.06]That's... That's not cool.
[359:20.98]Hopefully you find something else to do.
[359:25.63]Thanks for the one dollar, man.
[359:30.13]Yeah, you're better than that anyways.
[359:31.21]Don't worry.
[359:31.51]You're fucking better than that anyways.
[359:32.79]You know what I mean?
[359:36.24]Hey, hey.
[359:36.78]Good rins.
[359:37.36]Good rins.
[359:37.74]They just lost a valuable member of their team.
[359:41.26]Dude, you're gonna do so much more than that.
[359:42.66]Don't worry.
[359:49.87]Uh, thank you, Tar Alacrin for the one dollar.
[359:51.71]Again, Jeremy, you have more tech problems than literally all my friends and me combined.
[359:55.44]You can't blame Microsoft.
[359:56.84]Now, this is from earlier when I was on a rampage talking about how I hate technology.
[360:03.06]No, and I, look, to cap me being angry about technology and saying that I have no control over things, there are some things that I do have control over and that I either choose not to do because I don't have enough time or choose to do because, or I try to and I do it wrong.
[360:19.68]Um... But, like I said previously, I... I wish I didn't have technical problems.
[360:26.87]And look, it didn't end up affecting the stream today for very much time.
[360:31.35]You know, it was... We were a little bit late, but I mean, we're six hours in here now.
[360:35.83]I didn't stop the stream.
[360:36.64]I was thinking about maybe if I kept having lag or internet or technical problems, I was going to stop it, but...
[360:43.89]Look, I don't want to have my streams fuck up.
[360:49.08]It's not like a thing I think is fun.
[360:52.16]And even if I try to... I've tried to prevent problems, and I've made them worse.
[360:59.11]I really... That's not... My intention is not to have streams not work.
[361:05.90]Love this shit.
[361:07.20]I love hanging out with you guys.
[361:08.68]I love fucking making videos.
[361:09.94]I love doing this shit Why would I want this to go wrong?
[361:13.32]I mean?
[361:16.70]This is this is such a huge highlight of my week when I do this shit So I absolutely don't want these things to happen And I know that it's like but oh what it's your job I
[361:34.50]I don't know, man, but I don't want to treat it like a job.
[361:37.60]Let's be real, right?
[361:43.75]This is not... I don't want this to be... It's time to go to work.
[361:52.27]I don't want that to happen.
[361:59.03]Once it becomes a job, it becomes not fun anymore.
[362:04.44]And if I get really, really pissed off and really annoyed at, like, trying to troubleshoot issues, it's because I, I don't know, I just don't.
[362:13.15]I'm blowing off viewers to eat scorpions at the casino.
[362:24.14]I try to mitigate it as much as possible, but I do seem to have such strange luck with this type of shit.
[362:30.00]And it's not just you guys.
[362:31.12]I've been told by friends, and, like, like, Italics has talked about this before, and he's, like, been here and tried to... Like, sometimes, for some reason, I have problems, like, on the streams.
[362:46.93]And only on the streams.
[362:49.87]And I don't know if there's some other problem that streaming is doing extra taxing of my computer, my CPU, and maybe it's like something's fucking up in there, but it really seems to happen when I stream and pretty much only when I stream.
[363:07.54]Don't worry, we love you, you're the best streamer on Twitch.
[363:10.56]But, I know, but I don't, I don't want you guys to think, and I know you don't, but remember, I'm a fucking weirdo.
[363:16.95]I'm like a neurotic psycho.
[363:19.91]I don't want you guys to think that I just don't give a shit.
[363:23.50]That's why I said, like, the stuff that's out of my control, like the internet shit, like, that pisses me off way more than you guys trust me on that.
[363:32.83]When I have, like, a technical problem and I have to turn my computer off and, like, fix it, or when the internet goes down.
[363:37.92]Oh, boy.
[363:39.52]Oh, boy.
[363:40.06]That definitely angers me probably tenfold.
[363:46.08]He thinks he's the best streamer.
[363:56.63]we know you're dedicated no but I please don't think that I don't care I really don't want people to have that come off that way because like oh wait you didn't fix your computer and yeah I made a bunch of stupid analogies to like car crashes and stuff and I was around a lot but being completely real here I hope you understand that it's not my intention
[364:20.67]And I am very sorry that sometimes this shit happens.
[364:24.39]But, whatever.
[364:25.11]We just have to deal with it and go for it.
[364:27.05]So, I'm sorry that this shit happens.
[364:37.80]But I never want to get, like, fucking angry at this.
[364:40.52]It's the worst.
[364:41.46]It's the worst when things like this happen.
[364:46.64]Because I'm... I'm a goddamn control freak, and it's like out of my control, and I'm sitting there going like, how do I get this out of my fucking control?
[365:01.57]It was hilarious for a bit.
[365:03.23]That's fine.
[365:03.77]Just, again, I'm going to broken record this one more time.
[365:06.16]Please understand that I love and respect all you motherfuckers out there.
[365:12.19]for watching this channel and bearing with the stupid problems that I have sometimes.
[365:17.29]And I might be one of the only streamers that has these many fucking problems.
[365:21.15]I don't know.
[365:22.70]But... It's definitely... It's something that I think about a lot, so... Almost done with the bits now.
[365:38.44]So please take my, like, little meltdowns with a grain of salt.
[365:41.34]I don't... I'm not trying to... Um... I never want to, like, personally attack any of you guys.
[365:47.87]And I did just say earlier that, like, people getting mad at my internet problems is bullshit.
[365:54.01]Which, I mean, it's just... There's nothing I can do about that.
[365:57.23]And, like, some people do get really angry with me for having those problems.
[366:01.86]I've seen it.
[366:02.98]And even if people are trolling or just fucking around, I do see it.
[366:07.04]And...
[366:08.02]You know, that makes me sad because I don't want people to be angry at something that I can't fix.
[366:14.08]So it makes me fucking, it brings me down a little.
[366:21.65]Even, not even the people that are joking, because I know when people are joking around.
[366:25.21]But you see the guy come in that's just like,
[366:29.21]The guy comes in that's just like, oh, like, you fucking fixed it, stupid.
[366:33.30]And then they leave.
[366:34.00]And it's like, fuck, man, like, I can't.
[366:38.48]I can't.
[366:39.20]I'm sorry.
[366:40.08]I can't do anything about it.
[366:45.45]Jerma, stop.
[366:48.89]How long has this stream been over for?
[366:50.59]Eh, like 40 minutes.
[366:55.43]Sorry for bullying you.
[366:56.69]No, don't worry.
[366:58.00]Look.
[366:59.15]I need it.
[366:59.87]I need it.
[367:00.37]It keeps me on my toes.
[367:01.31]It keeps me on the ground.
[367:03.23]It keeps me thinking.
[367:04.02]It keeps me having to figure shit out.
[367:05.84]Don't worry about that.
[367:07.12]I know more than half the time we're all just having fun and fucking around.
[367:16.72]Will there be a stream tomorrow?
[367:17.60]Absolutely, yes.
[367:18.16]We're going to keep going with Dark Souls.
[367:25.16]Streaming wants to get bullied.
[367:26.96]No, I don't want to tell people what they can and can't say about me.
[367:33.53]But... I hope you're aware that I do think about this shit a lot.
[367:39.24]so sorry sorry if I seem defensive on a lot of these things because I You know how long I've been on the phone with like Comcast and how I bought this computer and there's a there was a bunch of problems with it and I Had to you know how many phone calls I've had to make with this stupid shit, and how many guys have been over my house I've had more guys over my house
[368:06.33]Strangers.
[368:07.15]Then friends.
[368:08.75]That's weird.
[368:09.61]That shouldn't be a thing.
[368:15.15]So many guys have been over here.
[368:19.20]I've had more random strangers in this house than personal friends of mine that I know.
[368:26.08]That's... I... I'm sorry.
[368:30.46]I'm sorry.
[368:35.97]But let's finish up the bits.
[368:46.83]Keep it in.
[368:48.59]Oh my god.
[368:51.25]It's not tech support.
[368:52.55]Grindr isn't tech support.
[368:54.35]That's not what I'm saying.
[368:59.11]Alright, you want me to be real?
[369:01.07]Listen, I have a girlfriend.
[369:05.71]Of course you guys know that.
[369:13.13]Like that's some kind of news to you guys.
[369:26.57]Oh my god.
[369:28.69]It's 2 a.m.
[369:29.35]I gotta go to fucking bed.
[369:31.33]I do have a girlfriend.
[369:34.05]Oh, really?
[369:34.67]Okay.
[369:36.51]Sure, buddy.
[369:41.83]I thought that was your caretaker.
[369:52.27]Hey, the way it will.
[369:53.10]Thanks for the one dollar.
[369:55.48]Programs for Linux will come as the demand comes.
[369:57.40]We need to create the demand in order for the ports to come.
[370:00.34]In order for that to happen, we need to raise awareness to bring support to Linux so that Microsoft has any real competition.
[370:06.38]I think it would be productive for you to mention the necessity of supporting Linux on stream as the only way we'll see support.
[370:14.11]Also, almost all the programs you use on a daily basis exist on Linux or have identical equivalents.
[370:19.45]Well, I mean, take this whole stream as like an endorsement for Linux.
[370:23.73]Because...
[370:26.69]I just want shit to work.
[370:29.33]And I don't want to troubleshoot a ton of problems when I didn't have the problems two days ago.
[370:38.15]If you're gonna have patches that brick people's computers, that's not my fault for not doing them.
[370:43.98]This patch came out in April and I only- I did it- I did it like within the last 24 hours, right?
[370:49.43]But you can't just have a patch brick a fucking computer, or fuck up a certain part of a computer.
[370:55.60]But because I didn't download this patch when it launched, that's my problem.
[371:00.52]No, it's their problem for putting out shit software updates.
[371:04.28]I shouldn't be at fault for that.
[371:09.76]Linux, at least it works, right?
[371:16.54]But, yeah, thank you the way it will.
[371:21.14]Thank you, Slade, for the $5.20.
[371:22.70]Hey man, you put in so much effort with your streams.
[371:25.07]It really isn't fair for us to be upset for things out of your control.
[371:28.33]Thanks for all your work.
[371:28.99]The majority of us really appreciate the effort.
[371:33.14]Thank you, but... I mean, you know...
[371:39.12]I do need to work on... being more prepared.
[371:44.88]And... I think a lot of that goes with... There's always like a lot of shit going on.
[371:50.62]Especially like now, and... There's like, you know, I think we talked about it before, that I wish there were like 30 hours in a day.
[372:02.54]Just all this random shit, like, it's even gonna get worse, moving across the country, man, it's gonna get worse.
[372:09.07]There will be probably at least two or three eating spaghetti streams.
[372:12.19]Because moving and having to stream, it's not going to happen, you know?
[372:20.52]I'm moving to Las Vegas.
[372:23.16]I will not be around early next week.
[372:27.82]There will be no streams next week early.
[372:29.96]There won't be a stream on Tuesday next week.
[372:35.08]uh the next stream that you'll see after tomorrow and maybe sunday will be on thursday the 20 the 28th or maybe even the 29th depends on when I get back yeah yeah moving to vegas las vegas
[373:03.15]And yeah, the purpose of moving is to make the streams better.
[373:08.96]I know, like, a lot of you guys mentioned, like, it's your job.
[373:10.92]It's your job.
[373:11.72]Why don't you take it, you know, you gotta take it more seriously.
[373:14.76]I mean, I'm moving across the country to take it more seriously.
[373:19.91]After that move, you're gonna see so many things that I wish I could have done here that I will be able to do now.
[373:25.75]So, hopefully that works out.
[373:32.88]He's still talking about this.
[373:34.68]No, somebody brought up Vegas.
[373:37.94]Somebody didn't know I was moving to Vegas, so I had to tell him.
[373:46.20]Have you been working on any projects or are you waiting for Vegas?
[373:50.87]On the podcast, on Charlie's official podcast tomorrow, there are two projects that I actually talk in detail about.
[374:00.11]so if you don't want to know what they are then do not listen to the last 20 minutes of that podcast because I literal spoilers like I talk about in detail the two things I want to do because there were a few questions about it so but it was fun that podcast was cool

[376:59.60]Thank you, Stix Renegade, for the $1.
[377:00.97]Speaking of Subway... Uh... The one near me got rid of their spicy brown mustard.
[377:06.89]Literally Hitler.
[377:11.13]I don't... I don't... I don't... You don't eat at Subway.
[377:14.90]That shit ain't even real chicken.
[377:16.14]It's like fuckin' 55% soy.
[377:20.38]You're eating a soy... You're eating a soy sandwich.
[377:23.94]You know, the CEO of Subway got really pissed off and is suing the person that came up with that.
[377:29.24]They are going hardcore at that guy that wrote that article about how it's soy.
[377:35.46]They are fucking furious.
[377:42.32]Sandwich elitist.
[377:43.52]No, all right, you know what, fine.
[377:45.57]Subway sucks, okay?
[377:48.17]Subway is disgusting.
[377:52.15]Have you ever eaten lettuce from Subway?
[377:57.43]It tastes... It's got the texture of cooked spinach.
[378:02.59]And the taste... Of... This, like, dirty... Sandy water.
[378:10.73]It just smells... It just... No.
[378:12.29]It's cooked spinach sand water.
[378:15.71]I'm sorry.
[378:20.70]Lettuce should not be the texture of cooked spinach.
[378:23.18]Wilty and gross and soggy.
[378:27.74]Plus, that bologna sucks.
[378:41.69]Subway started going down when Jared the Subway guy.
[378:43.93]Oh, he did great.
[378:50.68]Good thing you based your entire company's image, all of it, on Jared Fogle.
[378:57.76]Gonna have to do some, gonna have to do some, uh, site-wide changes.
[379:13.15]Are there any Boston foods you're gonna miss when you move to Vegas?
[379:15.65]Yeah, there's a few local places that I'm really gonna miss that make great food.
[379:24.57]But, yeah.
[379:26.94]Thank you, Stix.
[379:28.10]Thank you, Tar Alacrin, for the one dollar.
[379:30.66]Apparently the second half of one of my donations didn't go through.
[379:33.69]I was serious about loving the name thing.
[379:35.77]It warms my heart knowing that you actually remember me and I'm not just another little red man in the view counter.
[379:42.68]It's stuff like that that makes your stream so fun and welcoming.
[379:48.12]Well, I thank you, first of all.
[379:50.96]And, yeah, I... Look, I'll tell you, it's hard to remember everybody.
[379:55.52]It is.
[379:55.74]You know, sometimes there are thousands of people watching, right?
[380:01.67]But I try to remember names and... The badges do help people that have given a lot of money.
[380:08.51]It's easy for me to look and remember.
[380:11.31]But I really don't want to be... I've always hated the notion of that.
[380:17.19]There are people that are giving you tons of money.
[380:21.35]Potentially some of you have given thousands of dollars.
[380:26.49]Thousands.
[380:27.71]Hundreds and thousands of dollars.
[380:31.82]I want to, I don't want to just be like, yeah, thanks.
[380:34.02]Thanks a lot for the hundred bucks.
[380:35.22]All right.
[380:35.80]What was your name again?
[380:36.62]I don't fucking care.
[380:37.96]It's a lot of money.
[380:44.24]I see these badges pop up, like, all these subs.
[380:46.70]Some of you guys have been subs for fucking months, years.
[380:49.56]$30, $50 donation badges.
[380:53.70]Tons of subscriptions.
[380:54.83]It's a lot of money.
[381:02.31]Think about it a lot, I really do.
[381:03.57]That's a lot of fucking money, guys.
[381:11.85]But, thank you, man.

[384:20.80]I suppose I should look on the bright side.
[384:23.42]Only 10 more years until I get the senior citizen's discounted donut bar and delete it.
[384:27.60]Thank you, Garfin.
[384:34.17]Thank you, Lotja Dirt, for the 10 bucks.
[384:35.61]Jerma, find on your computer, edit group policy, and disable the auto-update.
[384:39.25]By the way, love your dedication.
[384:42.38]At this point, thank you so much, Lacha, for the 10 bucks.
[384:45.66]But at this point, I have, like, bricked my Windows update.
[384:49.90]And I have to reset my computer.
[384:52.44]Because it can't work.
[384:53.38]It will not update.
[384:54.16]I can't get it to work.
[384:55.78]And for some reason, whatever the update was, has screwed with my ability to capture games through OBS.
[385:00.88]I don't know why.
[385:01.64]I don't understand what it did.
[385:03.32]But it did something.
[385:06.02]But thank you.
[385:07.00]Appreciate it.
[385:07.98]I'll turn that on the second the computer comes back.
[385:12.76]But thanks a lot, man.
[385:13.40]Thank you, Spuda, for the $1.
[385:14.74]Just know that when we pick on you, it's because we love you and we appreciate everything that you do.
[385:19.60]And try and even... Everything you do, and try and even just streaming in general.
[385:26.99]No, I know.
[385:27.41]I know.
[385:28.67]But that doesn't mean that... No, I want the streams to be good.
[385:34.60]And if people get angry at me, or if people get annoyed, for real, and it doesn't happen very often, but sometimes it does.
[385:41.68]I actually feel terrible.
[385:44.16]If somebody is upset about something that I do or say, I'm just like, fuck, man.
[385:47.50]Like, that's not what I wanted.
[385:50.96]I don't want to waste your guys' time, right?
[385:52.60]Like, so if there's a problem and an hour goes by and you guys have shit, you know, you guys are people.
[386:00.19]You guys are giving me monumental chunks of your week.
[386:07.66]Think about that.
[386:08.24]We're talking like five, six, seven hours every couple of days.
[386:14.50]Even tonight.
[386:14.94]Some of you guys have been here for six and a half hours.
[386:19.86]That's a lot of fucking time to watch some random guy on the internet.
[386:25.67]So you bet your ass that I think about... I don't want people to be pissed off.
[386:30.79]I want people to be happy.
[386:31.73]I don't want people to be like, oh, what a waste of fucking time this was.
[386:34.21]Bye.
[386:36.86]I don't like that.
[386:38.62]At all.
[386:47.13]I know that didn't really happen.
[386:48.03]I mean, that didn't happen tonight.
[386:49.15]It happened for the first probably 30 or 40 minutes.
[386:53.21]And then, of course, we had like six hours of Dark Souls and we didn't really talk much about it after.
[386:56.76]It was a fun stream.
[386:59.06]But still.
[387:01.12]Your time is valuable.
[387:04.96]To me.
[387:06.56]It is.
[387:06.80]I don't want to waste your fucking time.
[387:17.77]Because I flip it around.
[387:18.65]And, like, I wouldn't want... Like, if I'm giving somebody my time... You know, I wouldn't want to just have to be treated like shit.
[387:28.16]Or have somebody waste my time and stuff, you know?
[387:36.08]But that's just kind of the way of it.
[387:41.22]The only thing worse than my technical problems is me apologizing and explaining them for two hours during pits.
[387:56.45]But, I mean, I'm... I'm addressing somebody that just asked again.
[388:01.56]I was... Sputa just said...
[388:06.83]Somebody brought it up, so I'm talking about it again.
[388:09.11]I didn't just stop in the middle of a sentence and start talking about it again.
[388:24.34]You make it sound like I was just talking about Garfield.
[388:26.90]Like, Garfield.
[388:27.50]Oh, look at that Garfield thing.
[388:29.84]Holy shit.
[388:30.26]Oh, turning 40.
[388:31.56]Garfield's turning 40.
[388:32.78]Look, I'm sorry about my technical problems.
[388:34.62]I can't help it.
[388:39.30]Thank you Maxie for the two bucks.
[388:40.50]I retract every bit I've ever given you.
[388:42.69]You will stand trial for your crimes against Subway Meatball Master Race.
[388:49.51]Oh, what you meant to say was School Lunch Meatball Sub.
[388:55.55]Get it out of here.
[388:57.63]Hey sir feline, thanks for the one dollar.
[388:59.13]Streamer only cares about money, admits it on stream.
[389:02.49]Not true, thank you.
[389:03.57]Play a big D, Danny.
[389:06.57]Thanks for the five dollars.
[389:10.32]Last but not least.
[389:11.32]Just finished my final uni exam, and what better way to celebrate than giving my favorite streamer some money?
[389:15.87]Now that I'm free, gonna be busy watching those VODs.
[389:17.97]Thanks for the continued entertainment, Germajacks!
[389:21.21]Thank you, Playabigdan.

[389:34.00]And with that, I will see you guys tomorrow, 7 o'clock.
[389:38.36]I will make sure that there are no goddamn problems.
[389:42.44]There he goes, bringing it up again.
[389:43.98]I believe the podcast is dropping tomorrow at some point on Charlie's channel, youtube.com slash critical.
[389:53.39]The official podcast.
[389:55.19]We talk about a lot of crazy shit.
[389:58.01]Talk about, you know, you'll see it.

[390:04.61]See you tomorrow.
