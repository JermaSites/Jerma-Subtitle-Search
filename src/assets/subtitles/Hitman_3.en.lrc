[00:01.08]No, no, I'm not late and I'm not canceling.
[00:06.50]I'm not late and I'm not canceling.
[00:10.52]Look what you made me do.
[00:11.14]Look what you made me do.
[00:13.66]I just tried to take a sip of my coffee.
[00:15.75]I stabbed my mouth right into the front of my lip.
[00:18.69]Look what you made me do.
[00:19.81]Hi, guys.
[00:24.43]How are you?
[00:24.77]Hope you're doing well.
[00:29.52]I had a little bit of a surprise.
[00:32.22]I was kind of, I forgot that Hitman's Free came out yesterday.
[00:37.90]I forgot.
[00:40.37]And here it is.
[00:40.99]I have a few things to talk about with you for a little while before we go anywhere.
[00:48.90]There is a very certain stream that some of you have been maybe waiting for the last week.
[00:54.40]Not the Catboy one.
[00:55.50]Don't worry.
[00:55.94]That's being worked on to all of you Catboy enthusiasts.
[01:00.04]Just hold on.
[01:02.56]So the Bionicle movie.
[01:05.72]Interestingly enough, I cannot stream that to Twitch.
[01:11.26]I need the rights to it.
[01:15.75]That's something that I cannot do.
[01:19.29]But, hold on a second.
[01:21.69]Hold on a minute.
[01:24.79]Reach out and see if they'll let me do it.
[01:27.59]So right now we're reaching out to see if that's something I can do.
[01:30.88]We're in the process of reaching out.
[01:34.16]Probably going to get instantly denied.
[01:36.32]But, you know, we're probably going to get denied.
[01:39.18]Look, there's like all kinds of music and shit in there.
[01:42.96]I don't have the distribution rights to show that even though it's free on YouTube.
[01:48.94]There's a lot of legal gray area there.
[01:52.40]So that's currently being worked on.
[01:55.38]Something else is being worked on too.
[01:59.02]There are four major, major things happening stream wise over the next probably three months.
[02:08.86]I'm just going to give you a quick little hint.
[02:11.80]I'm not going to tell you what it is.
[02:12.82]If you haven't even heard me talk about this.
[02:15.48]What's going on here?
[02:17.14]There's like a floating thing of dust right here.
[02:20.14]Get it out of here.
[02:21.91]I'm going to say two words.
[02:23.67]That's all I'm going to say.
[02:25.19]You will see this within the next couple of months.
[02:29.65]The archaeologist scream.
[02:34.69]Maybe work your brain around what that means.
[02:42.71]Although the first word was not even a word.
[02:45.47]It was a beginning, a preposition.
[02:50.69]What is it?
[02:52.33]What's a the?
[02:54.68]Is that a noun?
[02:55.54]It's not a verb.
[02:56.16]What is it?
[02:59.98]It's an article.
[03:03.32]Oh, okay.
[03:03.86]Whatever.
[03:06.06]Yeah, the title's bad.
[03:07.08]Whatever.
[03:09.52]What is a preposition?
[03:14.30]It's an article adjective.
[03:15.36]Yeah, but what's a preposition though?
[03:16.52]What does that do?
[03:17.32]What does that mean?
[03:23.14]You should what?
[03:24.54]You should see if you can get on the Colosseum.
[03:26.77]I don't even know what that is.
[03:32.23]Location or time.
[03:33.39]Okay, cool.
[03:35.99]Yeah, there's also, there's a lot.
[03:38.92]The baseball stream is happening.
[03:43.90]Every like 20 to 30 days here, as of like the 1st of February, this is going to be something else.
[03:52.93]2020 got destroyed for big streams.
[03:57.55]Two of them were pretty much already paid for and ready to go.
[04:00.21]One of them in particular had to be canceled.
[04:02.28]So we had to move a bunch of stuff from 2020 into 2021.
[04:04.12]So 2021 is going to be stacked.
[04:04.84]It's going to be loaded.
[04:12.52]With potentially fun stuff to do.
[04:20.33]Is this going to be the best year ever on the channel?
[04:23.79]I refuse to say that.
[04:25.81]Because if I say that, then it might be the worst year on the channel.
[04:29.80]I'm not going to do that.
[04:32.40]No.
[04:33.62]This might be some fun things to do.
[04:35.76]I can't say that.
[04:36.34]If you say that, all of a sudden it's become something... Now if it's not, then uh-oh.
[04:44.51]Every year is better than the last year.
[04:49.10]Until it's not.
[04:51.20]MonkaS.
[04:54.02]Year of the Catboy.
[04:55.02]Why are you peddling fried chicken to people?
[04:59.74]I saw that.
[05:00.34]What am I supposed to do about it?
[05:03.10]You want to see how far that meme has left this community?
[05:06.82]Like we talked about two or three weeks ago?
[05:08.48]Look no further than the Kentucky Fried Chicken account on Twitter.
[05:14.11]KFC underscore ES.
[05:17.71]Is that the... It's the... It's Espanol, right?
[05:23.64]It's the Spain version.
[05:24.56]Yeah.
[05:25.32]The Spanish Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[05:29.28]They made me Colonel Sanders with the sus face thing.
[05:32.39]That's just how you know it's out of our control anymore.
[05:34.73]And I can't control it anymore.
[05:42.83]What's that thing?
[05:43.87]I'm going to tell my kids that this was Colonel Sanders.
[05:49.41]But that's that's funny.
[05:51.34]I think it could be.
[05:59.72]Sue him.
[06:00.36]What do you mean?
[06:01.42]What am I supposed to do?
[06:04.44]Do you think the Kentucky Fried Chicken Twitter account made any money on that post?
[06:11.63]But should I like claim that post?
[06:16.39]What does that get me?
[06:20.48]DMCA them.
[06:24.26]No, I don't, I don't care.
[06:27.38]If I'm not going to go after the people that use me in a porn ad, am I going to go at, am I going to try to go after Kentucky fried chicken Spain?
[06:35.18]Are you guys out of your minds?
[06:42.69]I mean, what?
[06:45.00]What, what, what?
[06:45.96]I don't know.
[06:47.86]You guys weren't around for that?
[06:48.69]That wasn't that long ago.
[06:50.25]That was only like a few months ago.
[06:51.25]It was like six months ago.
[06:59.33]It's funny.
[07:00.25]Whatever.
[07:00.93]If people want to have fun with that image, what do you want me to say?
[07:06.49]Let me ask you this.
[07:07.97]Does bad luck Brian sue somebody for using the bad luck Brian image?
[07:13.18]What do you want me to say?
[07:18.00]He should.
[07:24.21]He should.
[07:27.53]You are no bad luck, Brian.
[07:31.79]I didn't say I was.
[07:32.65]I'm just saying that once it's kind of on the internet and it goes out there, what am I going to do about it?
[07:40.91]You are no bad luck, Brian.
[07:44.71]Let me just dump an entire bottle of detergent on the ground real quick.
[07:53.46]Okay.
[07:54.50]It's almost done.
[07:56.38]There it is.
[07:57.16]Gotta clean my room!
[07:58.44]Gotta clean my room!
[07:59.70]Gotta clean my room!
[08:00.58]I'm a little hoarse today for some reason.
[08:04.36]Streisand effect for exposure.
[08:09.38]What was that?
[08:09.92]That was a fucking fresh... Let's, hey, let's get, let's open it.
[08:13.84]Let's see what it sounds like.
[08:15.38]Do you hear that?
[08:19.13]That's a fresh Yule.
[08:21.25]Let's get a good sip of this berry Yule.
[08:32.40]No soy in that.
[08:33.60]Shut that mouth of yours.
[08:35.14]We're going to play the Hitman 3 today.
[08:38.42]There's no soy in it.
[08:39.83]There's no soy in this bottle.
[08:42.97]I like this shit.
[08:44.91]And I'm not sponsored by them.
[08:48.67]I was.
[08:49.05]Kind of cool, you know?
[08:58.06]No, I'm kidding.
[08:59.85]I actually this helped me gain weight helped me put on some weight back when I was having some trouble so no they get a they get a stamp of approval from me there are peanuts there are peanuts and heal there are peanuts and heal there are peanuts and heal there are peanuts and heal there are peanuts and heal okay oh okay should I say gross to that what do you want to say that's fine what's wrong with that where are their peanuts
[09:27.28]Contains tree nuts, coconut.
[09:29.70]So you were wrong.
[09:30.90]There's coconut, there's tree nuts in this.
[09:36.63]It's like probably made in the same plant that produces nuts or something.
[09:43.03]Tree nuts equal peanuts.
[09:44.19]Tree nuts are unshelled soy.
[09:51.32]What the fuck are you talking about?
[09:55.54]that's you're ridiculous alright hold on uh where am I going here I need to put this up yeah apparently from what I've heard guys I heard hitman 3 is like unbelievable thanks for the 10 subs uh washmeister I've heard this is the best one yet very excited
[10:21.21]Those of you that know this channel, we are Hitman enthusiasts.
[10:27.71]Hitman 2 was one of my favorite games that came out a couple years ago.
[10:31.32]The new kind of re-handled... I'm sorry, I've read somebody that said 1080 can't handle it.
[10:38.16]And you just threw me off completely.
[10:40.75]What was I doing?
[10:43.57]Anyways.
[10:47.11]I think it'll be fine.
[10:48.97]If it's not, then whatever.
[10:52.32]I heard it's very good.
[10:54.08]So I'm looking forward to it.
[10:54.84]We're just going to play it?
[10:56.98]I have no set... I wanted to do the VR, but it's PSVR only.
[11:03.02]I was serious.
[11:05.86]Alright, I had a PSVR.
[11:08.20]And I gave it away.
[11:10.22]I gave it to somebody.
[11:11.30]Because I was like, I'm never going to fucking use this ever again.
[11:14.52]Ever.
[11:16.64]It was not a single reason in my mind where that would ever turn on ever again.
[11:21.12]Because I had the Vive.
[11:24.80]If you buy a Vive and you have a PSVR, what's the point of having the PSVR at that point?
[11:34.54]The VR is really bad, though.
[11:36.17]Okay.
[11:43.33]I didn't break it.
[11:45.37]I'm procrastinating.
[11:46.17]Stop procrastinating.
[11:47.61]I read that wrong, I think.
[11:50.73]The title is bad.
[11:51.63]I don't care.
[11:52.07]It's just Hitman.
[11:54.13]That's all it is.
[11:54.65]That's what you came here for.
[11:55.61]My headphones.
[11:58.00]Stop stalling.
[12:04.76]I haven't seen you guys in like four, five, six days or something.
[12:07.78]I can't just hang out and say what's up?
[12:11.39]I can't like, I can't turn on the fucking webcam?
[12:15.43]I can't turn the webcam on and
[12:19.12]I can't what I'm not allowed to turn on the webcam and uh I can't turn the webcam on was I naked for a frame I hope not I can't turn the webcam on and show you this scrumptious cake what do you think about that that's a 2021 Rice Krispie Treat planetary cake
[12:49.52]This was supposed to be shown on, hold on, how's the hair look?
[12:52.44]This was supposed to be shown on New Year's.
[12:54.74]But, uh, I didn't have it.
[12:58.69]2021!
[12:59.01]Let's go.
[13:01.21]You're a comical British villain.
[13:02.95]You guys want to see something funny?
[13:09.92]That bed was like $200.
[13:10.74]That bed was like $30.
[13:31.00]Who made the cake?
[13:31.66]My mother did.
[13:33.08]My mother made the cake.
[13:33.86]I'm not going to bite it.
[13:34.60]I want to preserve it.
[13:41.63]$200 dog fed.
[13:43.29]Yeah, by the way, my mother's the one that made the shoe as well.
[13:52.07]Remember we talked about that?
[13:55.91]Bite the cake like it's an apple.
[13:57.21]I'm not going to bite.
[13:57.97]No, I want to preserve it.
[14:00.01]I want to put it in the freezer and like keep it frozen.
[14:03.76]This dude's a millionaire.
[14:05.94]No, I wanted my dog to be incredibly comfortable.
[14:07.84]I wanted my dog to be incredibly comfortable.
[14:11.90]Is there something wrong with that?
[14:15.69]And I'm going to spend money on my special boy.
[14:23.29]He's worth spending the money on, even though he doesn't even like the bed.
[14:27.09]In fact, he refuses to sleep in it now because the $30 circle bed is so much better, apparently.
[14:34.54]Your mom puts up with a lot of your shenanigans?
[14:38.18]I love my mother.
[14:39.00]Come on.
[14:41.44]She participates.
[14:47.26]Sleep on it.
[14:48.20]You sleep on that one.
[14:52.11]You just keep him around for YouTube revenue.
[14:55.81]Alright, let's get this fucking bathrobe off because it's hot and I can just be naked like I was.
[15:01.99]Like the way I should be.
[15:05.65]Make sure I don't accidentally turn the camera on because no, that would be very bad.
[15:09.33]Okay.
[15:11.36]This game is so good.
[15:12.42]I know.
[15:12.92]I'm so looking forward to it.
[15:15.94]IO Interactive just gets better.
[15:20.35]So much credit for me.
[15:22.11]So much.
[15:24.21]I want you to think of a company that is made that has like a franchise like this.
[15:30.43]They bought out their assets.
[15:32.09]They bought them out.
[15:33.01]They pulled away from Square Enix.
[15:34.61]They were like, you know, fuck it.
[15:35.93]We're buying you out.
[15:36.75]We're buying out our shit from you.
[15:40.02]They went over.
[15:40.76]They made Hitman, Hitman 2, this one Hitman 3.
[15:43.74]They know what they can do.
[15:44.64]They know what they're good at.
[15:45.90]And they just do it.
[15:49.37]And all of these have been very, very, very good.
[15:57.43]Nobody talks about this.
[15:58.49]Nobody talks about how Square, I almost said Square Enix.
[16:01.03]That was wrong.
[16:01.93]Nobody, does anybody talk about how good, like how great IO Interactive is with their releases?
[16:06.09]It's been like every, they just, they know what they're doing.
[16:08.71]Nobody talk, but people are always like, oh, I love Bethesda.
[16:11.13]No, no, no.
[16:11.94]Love IO Interactive.
[16:13.00]That's better.
[16:18.67]you said you already said that so what this might like one of my favorite game companies okay uh are you guys ready I'm bro I'm excited god damn it I should whatever god great is my uh turn the cam on no

[16:47.87]It's 4 p.m.
[16:48.71]Pacific.
[16:49.13]You had time.
[16:54.55]Stop stalling.
[16:55.39]Stop stalling.
[16:55.89]This is like my favorite game of the year.
[16:58.08]This is gonna be my favorite release of the year.
[17:01.00]I play like four new games a year.
[17:03.02]This is definitely going to be... Just watch.
[17:05.76]Clip this.
[17:07.08]I'm gonna be sitting there at the Game Awards this time next year.
[17:10.82]Hitman 3 is going to be on that list.
[17:12.54]And I'm going to be like, oh!
[17:13.80]I'm going to be pursing my lips, leaning back, leaning back, and the bathrobe pointing.
[17:17.04]There it is!
[17:17.42]That's the one!
[17:18.96]And it's going to lose.
[17:21.16]It's not going to win.
[17:22.94]And I'm going to be like, you know, I really wish Hitman 3 would have won.
[17:25.14]I'm going to be like, that's my boy.
[17:32.16]Look at this shit.
[17:33.34]I can play them all?
[17:35.60]I can play every single one of these?
[17:40.93]Is Agent 47 the Super Mario of PC gaming now?
[17:45.67]Now that we haven't seen Gordon Freeman in a long time.
[17:59.68]Okay, should we get like a previously on the next Game of Thrones?
[18:03.14]Let's do it.
[18:03.54]Alright, we're going to do previously on the next Game of Thrones.
[18:07.28]Agent 47 and Diana Burnwood are the world's top assassins working for the ICA.
[18:14.10]Unknowingly, they have been hired by a shadow client to target a number of operatives of Providence, a secret organization working... I'm so excited.
[18:21.98]I love this game.
[18:23.73]I'm already going to love it.
[18:24.75]I can't wait to throw a plate at the first person I see.
[18:27.19]Approaches Diana and makes her a deal.
[18:29.93]Eliminate the shadow client and learn about 47's past.
[18:34.31]Past.
[18:35.19]My past.
[18:35.69]Not my past.
[18:36.27]Louder.
[18:36.43]We need more Huel.
[18:37.18]Hold on.
[18:54.16]For three Providence partners.
[18:57.26]Eliminate them, and the war would be over.
[19:00.44]I took my headphones out.
[19:01.26]I have to, like, move.
[19:02.38]However, the constant has an ace up his sleeve.
[19:06.10]Look, I don't even need to pay attention to.
[19:07.94]I know how to play Hitman.
[19:10.96]Throw plates, shoes.
[19:15.47]Strangle people in the bathroom.
[19:18.61]And you have a barcode on your head.
[19:21.18]That's all I know.
[19:21.86]That's all I really need to know.
[19:23.06]Holy shit, did you actually go in a plane in this one?
[19:26.44]On top of the world.
[19:27.22]47, this is Diana here.
[19:32.66]Come on, do it, do it, do it, do it so I can fucking just move on.
[19:36.43]No, that's not you.
[19:37.15]Wah.
[19:56.01]Alright.
[19:56.49]Do you get to drive a car?
[20:04.58]Did they finally let you do that in Hitman?
[20:07.18]Please.
[20:08.63]Do you drive a car in Hitman 3?
[20:10.25]And it never gave us a second thought.
[20:20.16]Okay, if it's a full letter grade, if I can drive a car.
[20:23.03]What if it's an A?
[20:24.89]Goes to S. Okay.
[20:39.03]Don't see very much water.
[20:40.29]They must have had plenty of heal on them.
[20:43.39]Okay, I'm done doing this.
[20:44.73]I'm not sponsored by this company.
[21:18.46]Hitman.
[21:19.00]Hitman.
[21:22.37]Pause button on an Xbox controller.
[21:24.01]This is the Xbox version.
[21:34.91]The partners are down there.
[21:37.81]You know, I never planned this far ahead.
[21:42.02]You never do.
[21:44.04]I see someone got his memory back.
[21:50.16]Is it?
[21:51.24]Whoa.
[21:52.78]Pull it, pull it, pull it.
[21:53.74]Pull the wire.
[22:04.32]I would laugh so hard if I took control now and the first mission was to kill the guy in the fucking helicopter.
[22:09.49]The pilot.
[22:09.81]If I fly over there.
[22:15.68]the constant has escaped he persuaded one of the sailors into setting him free and since then he's been seizing control of Providence assets and resources I can only assume carlisle is rushing to contain the damage if she slips away again okay we'll keep track of
[22:31.28]Make sure she doesn't.
[22:32.72]Make sure she doesn't get away.
[22:35.18]Your destination is the Scepter, the world's tallest building where the partners are laying low.
[22:40.73]Gotta throw people off the building, right?
[22:42.67]Come on.
[22:44.49]Marcus Stuyvesant is fifth generation old money.
[22:47.79]His family made its fortune in real estate and banking and were at one point the chief landowners in New York.
[22:53.79]Carl Ingram is a powerful Washington kingmaker.
[22:56.43]I thought that was the one ring for a second.
[22:59.35]I'm like, holy shit.
[23:00.74]And later established a globe-spanning empire in oil, coal, and steel.
[23:05.64]Both families long since retreated from public view, but their quiet dominance endures to this day.
[23:12.38]Now, the partners likely suspect that we're coming.
[23:15.56]Oh, God.
[23:16.04]So Mr. Gray will infiltrate building controls and disable all electronic doors and elevators.
[23:20.68]Do I have a time limit of how long I can do this for?
[23:22.24]Stuyvesant and Ingram are about to find.
[23:24.50]They have nowhere left to run.
[23:26.26]Lockdown is this one.
[23:29.26]Right.
[23:29.80]How tall is this building?
[23:30.82]This is our moment, 47.
[23:33.22]Providence ruined our lives with a flick of a pen.
[23:36.71]Today, we return the favor.
[23:40.41]Happy hunting.
[23:42.49]Mission active.
[23:43.69]Oh God, IO Interactive just fucking nails it every time.
[23:50.27]Alright, we got up.
[23:50.94]Target is Carl Ingram and Marcus Stuvesa.
[23:55.70]Stuvesant.
[23:57.94]Okay.
[23:58.86]Kill conditions.
[24:00.98]Any method, any disguise.
[24:02.26]We're not doing any weird mischievous play.
[24:05.20]Difficulty is on, uh,
[24:10.07]Yeah, just professional.
[24:10.79]That's fine.
[24:11.77]Unlimited saves.
[24:12.59]We can just... Story missions are there.
[24:13.99]I'm not playing on Master.
[24:14.99]I just like walking around and strangling people.
[24:16.51]Alright, we just gotta kill these guys.
[24:22.47]You ready?
[24:24.71]Now I know... What did it say?
[24:26.77]Stewie?
[24:27.47]Professionals have standards.
[24:31.54]He's bad at the game.
[24:32.34]I haven't even pressed play yet.
[24:33.60]I haven't even started playing.
[24:40.73]What are you talking about?
[24:41.59]Alright, here's the real test.
[24:43.35]Can my computer play this game?
[24:44.87]It's been a big lead-up leading to it.
[24:47.65]Let's see if I can stream the game.
[24:54.58]Welcome to Dubai, 47.
[24:55.88]Oh, look at those hot air balloons.
[24:58.76]Today is the inauguration of the scepter, and the ceremony is well underway.
[25:06.32]Is that me?
[25:06.94]Oh no.
[25:07.26]Hmm.
[25:07.34]God.
[25:07.42]Just do like an alley-oop with a grenade, a floor under.
[25:09.18]Done.
[25:09.32]What?
[25:09.50]Wait, what?
[25:10.12]Oh my god.
[25:10.36]I will be shitting my pants right now.
[25:40.59]I forget how to play Hitman though.
[25:41.81]How do you play Hitman?
[25:44.82]How do you play Hitman?
[25:48.76]I don't even remember how to play.
[25:52.98]Can I climb this?
[26:00.90]You're a fake fan.
[26:02.24]I need like a... I'll get it.
[26:08.57]No harness?
[26:09.39]Wait, I have a parachute.
[26:12.47]What's in here?
[26:15.65]That's a long way to go.
[26:17.58]Just do the joke already.
[26:19.76]I'm not gonna... Hold on.
[26:20.46]Oh, it's control.
[26:21.10]Right.
[26:21.28]Control.
[26:21.70]You can see... Can I snipe that guy?
[26:23.44]How do I stand up?
[26:29.22]X is climb.
[26:36.25]It's not C. Hang.
[26:41.04]Alright, and then scale.
[26:41.82]It's X is scale and climb and everything.
[26:43.30]Okay.
[26:47.46]I thought I missed.
[26:48.52]Use your camera?
[26:50.29]How do I stand up?
[26:51.01]Oh, C. Okay, you guys weren't lying.
[26:53.09]Quip your camera.
[26:53.57]Press or I to open your inventory.
[27:06.17]Camera.
[27:08.83]Aim at the camera.
[27:09.77]Are you fucking kidding me?
[27:15.65]No, they didn't.
[27:17.11]They added this.
[27:18.68]They added a little like Best Buy all the way to the left camera.
[27:22.28]Are you serious?
[27:28.14]Holy shit, that's unbelievable.
[27:29.34]OK.
[27:33.86]Can you take a selfie?
[27:37.32]I hope you can take a selfie.
[27:40.84]Oops.
[27:42.82]Hide menu.
[27:43.48]How do I navigate?
[27:44.54]Cancel.
[27:48.23]Z and X. Oh, shit.
[27:53.55]Look at this.
[27:53.81]Wait, wait, wait.
[27:54.29]Alright.
[28:00.12]Hold on.
[28:00.40]Let's do every single wedding invitation you've ever seen.
[28:15.53]And then up the top left here, there's like a photo of them like kissing in a movie theater.
[28:27.49]If it were me, if it were me, there'd be like a guy in a groom outfit falling out of this balloon on the right.
[28:33.57]Just like I'm falling out of the balloon and whatever the bride would be, it's like screaming, yelling.
[28:39.20]Like, oh, with this terrified face and I'm falling.
[28:41.92]I'm like, at least, what happened?
[28:44.62]Did it upload that?
[28:46.66]Stop.
[28:46.92]What are you doing?
[28:47.80]What?
[28:49.71]What happened?
[28:50.19]It just went up to your Twitter.
[29:01.19]Get the camera out of here.
[29:03.06]There we go.
[29:03.58]Fiber wire.
[29:06.20]What's the sprint button?
[29:08.94]47.
[29:08.98]The inauguration is taking place close by.
[29:11.66]Stop taking photos of shit.
[29:12.82]Uh-oh.
[29:12.96]Ooh, there's a coin over here.
[29:14.38]I had to just see what it was like.
[29:36.85]Dude, you know what?
[29:37.93]IO Interactive, I love you.
[29:39.37]You're like the best video game company.
[29:41.67]But let me like... No, I don't want to do that.
[29:43.33]I want to throw the coin to be able to throw it in people's eyes.
[29:46.51]I want to just be able to baseball complete pitchers throw this into somebody's head.
[29:49.64]And try to hit them in the eye.
[29:50.90]Alright, that's what I would add.
[29:58.38]Okay, here we go.
[30:00.38]There's got to be a costume over here, right?
[30:01.80]Ooh, is this drinks?
[30:07.52]Sensitivity might be a little too high.
[30:11.65]Is this normal for a guy to be walking in like this?
[30:16.45]Oh.
[30:36.43]Okay, I'm sorry.
[30:38.05]Restart the mission.
[30:39.95]Wait, did it not save?
[30:41.03]It didn't save, right?
[30:50.42]Should I just restart it?
[30:59.82]Wait, just how do I die?
[31:00.76]Somebody kill me.
[31:03.84]Somebody kill me.
[31:11.34]Somebody kill me.
[31:15.17]Kill me.
[31:16.71]Kill me.
[31:20.43]Thank you.
[31:20.85]Okay, let me start over.
[31:32.76]Okay, here we go.
[31:33.72]Load.
[31:36.88]There we are.
[31:37.46]Okay, let's go.
[31:39.47]You have to just punch somebody when you first, it's like GTA.
[31:43.67]The first 45 minutes that anybody plays Hitman, it's the first 45 minutes that you play GTA.
[31:49.51]Don't lie to me.
[31:50.75]You run over the first person you see, you punch the first person in the face, and you just shoot a rocket into the sky.
[31:56.24]That's what, in Hitman.
[31:58.44]The first thing you do, punch the first person in the face, strangle the first person in the bathroom.
[32:05.45]And then you play the game.
[32:06.43]That's bad.
[32:07.89]You're a psychopath.
[32:08.45]No.
[32:08.51]Then we all are.
[32:09.01]You're telling me the first thing you did in GTA 5 was not immediately punch the first pedestrian you fought.
[32:15.65]The first one.
[32:16.87]Immediately.
[32:32.79]Would you stop at every red light?
[32:34.22]Alright, here we go.
[32:42.10]It's time.
[32:48.71]Alright, so now here we go.
[32:51.83]What's this quicksave?
[32:54.61]What's quicksave?
[33:03.17]Is there no quicksave?
[33:07.52]Is it F5?
[33:07.94]I don't see it on here.
[33:14.42]Is it F5?
[33:15.52]There is none.
[33:20.14]F5.
[33:20.28]It's not F5.
[33:21.68]Whatever.
[33:25.67]Okay, here we go.
[33:27.45]Eliminate.
[33:32.67]Thank you.
[33:34.18]This is cool.
[33:34.62]Alright, hold on.
[33:35.10]I need to change sensitivity.
[33:36.70]Way too high.
[33:39.78]Let's go with 45.
[33:47.66]Most importantly, alright.
[33:48.82]Bright light.
[33:49.52]Holy shit.
[33:54.00]So, you've served drinks?
[33:57.82]I'm just trying to get a drink.
[33:59.56]You have a tray of drinks.
[34:00.70]Was this weird if I come up to try to get one?
[34:03.22]What?
[34:03.52]Whoa.
[34:31.88]Sorry.
[34:34.28]It's been... Look, it's been a couple of years.
[34:36.68]I need to... I'm gonna do this.
[34:38.57]Welcome to the next, like, fucking six hours, guys.
[34:43.49]That wasn't... That wasn't the target?
[34:50.91]The bitrate is fucked?
[34:52.74]Is it?
[34:52.98]Welcome.
[35:04.47]Oh, because of the sun, I see.
[35:05.63]Alright, so I have to be a good Hitman.
[35:09.27]I brought this up before.
[35:10.72]Playing Hitman the right way is like driving and stopping at every red light in GTA.
[35:15.64]It's very hard to do.
[35:16.62]Okay.
[35:18.08]Woohoo!
[35:38.35]Very cool.
[35:45.09]Thank you.
[35:49.01]Alright, we're looking for... We're looking for an opportunity.
[35:53.37]Okay, back here.
[35:54.21]Let me just... I'm going to schmooze for a little bit.
[36:06.44]You're breath... What?
[36:08.87]Looking for an opportunity.
[36:09.71]Anybody have an opportunity for me?
[36:12.01]What can I do with these?
[36:15.59]Can I walk up here?
[36:17.11]Is this allowed?
[36:17.59]Who?
[36:17.67]Who's talking?
[36:20.21]Sorry.
[36:20.63]I have no idea.
[36:42.98]I don't know who was just talking.
[36:45.34]The guy in the jacket?
[36:54.75]Okay, this guy is looking for private access to the guy's penthouse upstairs.
[36:57.87]I'm going to follow this guy around for a little bit.
[37:02.30]You have to subdue this guy.
[37:03.74]Hold on.
[37:06.00]I have to know what the plan is.
[37:08.97]Kill him now.
[37:09.83]I'm not going to kill him now.
[37:11.26]I need an opportunity.
[37:22.60]Wait, so Whipple just guests at the party, so he doesn't have special access to anything?
[37:26.15]You can smoke in here?
[37:30.67]I hear it's not just the Royal Highness.
[37:38.27]I'm going to ask you politely to move along.
[37:41.23]Is this guy a hitman too?
[37:44.31]We're both hitmen.
[37:45.37]Can I help you?
[37:46.15]You're kind of freaking me out.
[37:50.56]Alright.
[37:50.90]This is another player.
[37:52.30]47.
[37:53.38]I would like to address the Providence partners directly.
[38:01.64]What's this?
[38:02.75]I want them to know why this is happening.
[38:06.34]and I have an idea but it requires you finding a map terminal wait you I can't just I was supposed to just hold right trigger and just shoot a like I was gonna shoot that guy in the red dragon listen I want to talk to the partners directly make them understand why all of this is happening
[38:27.74]Okay.
[38:28.00]Server room.
[38:28.60]Okay.
[38:28.74]Is this person actually in my ear?
[38:29.96]Should I follow this one?
[38:31.63]Okay, we have... Bird of Prey.
[38:32.59]Here we go.
[38:57.24]Let's follow this one.
[38:58.02]Let's do it.
[39:04.65]Interact with the map, didn't I?
[39:05.83]Push button.
[39:12.68]How do I... Oh.
[39:12.92]Push it harder.
[39:15.62]Okay.
[39:15.94]Staff area.
[39:16.82]What do you got on yours?
[39:27.71]What iPad game do you have?
[39:32.71]Why can't I... I can't... How do I get up?
[39:48.52]How do you get up?
[39:50.86]I can't get up.
[39:52.48]I can't get up.
[39:54.01]I can't get up.
[40:03.54]Here it comes.
[40:04.20]No, I'm fine.
[40:04.90]Alright, infiltrate the staff area.
[40:11.52]Wait.
[40:13.18]Ooh, an apple!
[40:15.08]Can I eat it?
[40:18.23]It might be an opportunity that presents itself right there.
[40:24.59]Oh, you can throw an apple in somebody's face.
[40:26.23]Oh my god.
[40:30.68]Ah, okay.
[40:32.38]I'm just going to... I'm going to bring an apple.
[40:39.98]I'm going to go this way.
[40:42.09]Staff room.
[40:42.61]I probably need a staff coat.
[40:45.53]That's a staff right there.
[40:46.45]Oh, 47.
[40:46.53]What are you doing?
[40:59.99]47.
[41:00.03]Yeah, I have the code.
[41:03.23]47.
[41:03.27]I don't know why you're doing this.
[41:04.11]I have the code.
[41:08.86]It's 4.
[41:10.00]Okay.
[41:11.98]You got a staff outfit.
[41:12.92]Nice job.
[41:14.16]Where's your code again?
[41:15.08]It's 4.
[41:17.58]Uh, 47.
[41:22.01]What's the code? 47.
[41:32.06]That's not it.
[41:34.66]How do I... What are the... What's the code?
[41:39.96]47 something?
[41:41.32]4708?
[41:43.86]It's not right.
[41:44.58]4706.
[41:46.44]That's not it.
[41:50.07]Oh, it is.
[41:53.05]Okay, I have to press okay.
[41:56.17]There's quite a bit of security here.
[41:59.35]One moment.
[42:01.18]You ready for some more fresh air, 47?
[42:03.06]I got this cool costume now.
[42:08.54]I cannot believe James called in sick today.
[42:11.08]Wait, we have an opportunity.
[42:12.74]His Highness has everyone working triple shifts.
[42:15.12]There's so much going on here.
[42:16.54]I've had four staff update meetings already.
[42:18.92]And now that crazy manager called us into another meeting, so now we've got to memorize new lists of guest names...
[42:24.98]Yeah, what else?
[42:25.70]What else?
[42:26.20]Don't forget that.
[42:27.70]We got a wrench over here?
[42:29.16]You have to have a wrench in there, right?
[42:30.80]Ooh.
[42:30.92]Do they care?
[42:53.00]They're not going to care, right?
[42:54.39]What if I need this for something?
[42:57.37]Just throw a cigarette on the ground.
[42:59.71]You just littered a cigarette.
[43:02.15]How do I go, stop!
[43:04.07]You violated the law.
[43:05.23]Littering.
[43:08.07]That'll be 400 coin.
[43:10.88]Fuck you, guard.
[43:16.92]You were just watching.
[43:18.34]Oh my god, that was horrible.
[43:40.78]Don't mind me.
[43:41.38]I'm just getting a can.
[43:43.00]Bathroom!
[43:43.58]Pog!
[43:44.07]Pog!
[43:44.45]Bathroom!
[43:46.05]Toilet control panel?
[43:51.03]Oh shit!
[43:51.55]What is malfunctioning?
[43:52.57]Is there a camera in the bathroom?
[44:11.37]I think that's stuck.
[44:11.97]I think that's going to be stuck there for a very long time.
[44:17.72]Can I plunge somebody?
[44:18.50]Wait, do you have a card?
[44:19.40]Ooh, he's got something.
[44:20.96]What's this?
[44:23.16]He has some other stuff on him.
[44:33.71]Um.
[44:34.79]I don't know why.
[44:35.13]I was just trying to flush him down the toilet.
[44:39.77]Wait.
[44:40.19]People won't come in here now.
[44:47.45]Put it down.
[44:51.56]Good enough.
[44:55.17]No, no, no.
[45:17.81]Did I say repent?
[45:20.57]Repent!
[45:25.65]Give me the axe.
[45:32.03]Wait.
[45:34.27]A pair of scissors too.
[45:35.21]I want those.
[45:35.57]Alright, get in the server room.
[45:40.87]And now all I see online are ads for these fucking shoes.
[45:45.25]There should be a box you can check when you're just cringe browsing, you know?
[45:49.09]Cringe browsing?
[45:50.83]Ads like that are the best part of the internet.
[45:53.06]Don't you think I've got my, this security professional loves his Cavalier King Charles Spaniel shirt?
[45:58.42]Yeah, that's a pretty good show.
[46:11.40]Okay, well, would I just use the coin to do that?
[46:14.98]I think I can open that window remotely.
[46:17.46]Cool, alright, let's do it.
[46:18.88]Camera, you got it.
[46:19.41]What is it?
[46:20.93]What are you doing?
[46:34.23]What are you doing?
[46:43.67]Okay, how do I get out of this?
[46:50.72]How close can I get?
[46:59.28]Flash right in the face.
[47:05.56]How do I save this photo?
[47:06.76]How do I save this photo?
[47:13.70]Wait, do they care that I'm doing this?
[47:18.80]They must not care, right?
[47:19.62]Alright, they don't care.
[47:20.82]What do I... This... They're going to watch me go out the window.
[47:24.52]I have to stop this from happening.
[47:44.11]Alright, leave, leave, leave, leave.
[47:54.52]Get out of here.
[47:56.88]Throw them out.
[47:57.44]No!
[47:58.92]Why would I do that?
[48:09.93]Because.
[48:10.25]No, I'm not doing that.
[48:11.85]I don't need to.
[48:13.79]I want that axe though.
[48:14.65]What the fuck?
[48:15.15]Give me the axe.
[48:16.21]How do I turn this on?
[48:18.25]Wait.
[48:32.14]Is there ray tracing?
[48:32.90]I don't have a 10... I have a... I have 1080.
[48:35.32]Okay.
[48:35.70]Got it.
[48:35.86]I can't take it with me, so I might as well throw it over there.
[49:02.83]Okay, take the scenic route.
[49:05.87]Holy shit, he's right there.
[49:06.71]Alright.
[49:19.22]Shit.
[49:19.86]Whatever.
[49:20.06]What am I supposed to do?
[49:35.70]On this ledge over here.
[49:40.90]Get... What am I supposed to do?
[49:45.38]I can't get on this ledge?
[49:47.18]Use the camera.
[49:49.28]I don't have to go down there?
[49:55.26]What's the point of this?
[49:57.84]What?
[49:58.56]What's the point of this?
[50:00.61]What was the point of doing this?
[50:16.23]Other ledge?
[50:19.15]Use camera, use camera.
[50:21.41]On the other one?
[50:21.95]Use the camera on the... Oh shit, Neanderthals just came in with a raid.
[50:27.89]What's going on, Neanderthals?
[50:31.13]It's me, Jerma985.
[50:31.85]Hope you had a good stream, Neanderthals.
[50:35.75]Maybe go the right way.
[50:36.53]Hold on, I'm... Apology raid?
[50:40.59]Why is there an apology raid?
[50:44.23]Apology raid?
[50:52.32]I hope you had fun, whatever you're doing.
[50:54.86]Always, always a welcome.
[50:56.83]Welcome, uh, presents.
[50:59.09]Pianos.
[51:00.99]Sing the raid song.
[51:13.24]Uh-oh.
[51:14.76]This is like the part of the live concert where the singer, like, is just waiting for the time to come in.
[51:21.21]And they kind of forget the fucking lyrics.
[51:23.95]And the whole band is playing the intro.
[51:26.53]And the singer's just kind of dancing around.
[51:27.85]And it's like, come on, do it!
[51:30.31]And the singer goes over.
[51:42.88]to the fucking guitarist and starts like hamming his head back and forth.
[51:46.29]And the guy's just fucking doing a crazy riff and he's just begging.
[51:49.37]He leans back and he whispers like, fucking come on, man, this is killing me.
[51:54.49]And... Welcome to the stream, you've all shown your bare faces.
[52:04.14]It's all...
[52:12.84]Where do I go?
[52:13.32]Where do I go?
[52:13.76]Where do I go?
[52:14.20]I don't know what to do.
[52:18.72]I'm so stupid.
[52:31.88]Vault?
[52:32.72]I know, but I can't.
[52:33.66]I'm trying to grab this ledge over here.
[52:37.33]Wouldn't this be the scenic route over here?
[52:38.71]I can't grab this ledge.
[52:41.74]Viewers gone?
[52:42.32]Oh, whatever.
[52:45.78]I can't drop here.
[52:48.91]Look up.
[52:51.31]Should I be able to... What the fuck?
[52:58.65]What?

[53:13.29]So, I don't... Why can I not do this?
[53:16.44]Just keep going left?
[53:17.64]I can.
[53:19.60]Talk about that, right?
[53:21.18]I would assume to climb that and grab that and shimmy.

[56:13.83]So now I'm the janitor.

[63:08.05]We can use this to summon the partners to a fake meeting, 47.
[63:12.67]Alright.
[63:13.07]I'm no hacker like Emmett.
[63:14.51]A silent alarm has been tripped.
[63:16.15]Security is on its way.
[63:17.47]Hide, 47.
[63:34.84]Nice stormtrooper aim.
[63:36.22]Did he look in the toilet?
[63:49.77]You looked in the toilet.
[64:04.52]You looked in the toilet.
[64:07.12]Like he could be in the toilet.
[64:11.46]I mean, they probably heard a ton of stories about this guy.
[64:15.36]He can be anybody.
[64:16.36]He can be anything.
[64:17.16]He can be any object.
[64:18.20]They probably think I can be objects.
[64:27.43]Okay, am I good?
[64:33.50]He's down there.
[64:34.26]Alright, hold on.
[64:34.78]I gotta get the penthouse key.

[65:12.22]Was it too late?
[65:27.99]Who's that guy in there?
[65:36.68]I have one.
[65:37.02]Don't I have one?
[65:38.40]I don't have a card?
[65:38.98]I am maintenance.
[65:40.04]I'm compromised though.
[66:09.47]I need to reload the safe.
[66:14.24]No, no, not yet.

[67:14.60]Alright.
[67:20.83]Into the maintenance room.
[67:21.85]Get a maintenance key.

[67:57.40]Oh, I got it.
[67:57.82]Alright, we're good.
[68:12.93]Alright, the people down on the first floor right now are probably just like, um... This is a really nice party, but people keep coming... People keep falling from second floor.
[68:21.88]I think that's something we should probably look into.
[68:23.48]Um, is it the letters?
[68:24.06]The letters lit up?
[68:24.56]R-O...
[68:39.44]A D road.

[69:49.63]Uh, AM... AM Armor?
[69:54.83]Look at the screens.
[69:56.77]Video feed.
[69:57.41]Downloading video feed.
[70:00.40]Monitoring server disabled.
[70:02.10]Body... Monitoring server disabled.
[70:15.82]Did I do it?
[70:19.14]What about this screen?
[70:22.06]Look on top?
[70:27.73]Yeah.
[70:28.67]Is it the letters?
[70:30.69]Central processing unit.
[70:31.71]Do I have to spell somebody's name?
[70:41.14]M-O-A.
[70:42.50]More guards are on their way.
[70:47.21]Spell Andy.
[70:48.84]A-N-D-Y.
[70:55.06]More guards.
[70:57.38]Reload on that.

[71:03.10]There we are.
[71:07.36]One of the screens.
[71:08.00]This screen is different.
[71:10.21]It's this one.
[71:11.63]It's this one.
[71:12.11]This screen is different.
[71:12.83]It's this one.

[71:21.11]When?
[71:21.33]Oh shit, really?
[71:22.01]Wait.
[71:22.15]Turn all the cameras off too.
[71:44.56]Andy?
[71:45.76]What?
[71:48.58]Open all the doors.
[71:49.26]And deposit emergency funds.
[71:55.65]What happened?
[71:57.95]A bunch of gold bars just came out of that.
[71:59.83]What happened?
[72:01.09]Did I just make a frenzy at the first floor?
[72:03.39]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[72:05.35]I gotta go to the meeting.
[72:09.49]Save it, save it, save it, save it.

[72:38.38]Oh, fuck.
[72:38.78]Okay, we're good.
[72:41.74]You don't have to search me, right?
[72:44.53]Oh, thank God.
[72:50.94]Oh my god, there he is.
[72:52.40]There he is, there he is, there he is.
[72:54.12]Get a chainsaw and cut the tree down and drop the tree on his head.
[72:57.22]Saved her.
[73:11.22]Nice.
[73:13.62]Hey, I'm with him.
[73:15.42]We're together.
[73:16.68]I'm his personal bodyguard.
[73:23.74]I know you love the Golden Delicious.
[73:26.68]I do too.
[73:27.00]I can?
[73:27.72]How do I?
[73:28.74]Wait.
[73:29.54]Both of them are in the same room.
[73:49.27]I don't... That doesn't matter.
[73:54.11]The panel doesn't matter, dude.
[73:55.83]The panel doesn't matter.
[73:59.74]I don't care about the panel.
[74:00.52]I just want to... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[74:03.38]I want to drop the chandelier on his head.
[74:13.53]Come on, hurry!
[74:14.73]How do I drop that?
[74:15.75]Shoot it?
[74:41.70]What's coming to him?
[74:43.01]You know, Marcus, my father taught me many things throughout my life.
[74:49.83]Fuck!
[74:51.43]Oh, what happened?
[74:54.01]Are you guys alright down there?
[74:57.21]Oh, this shaky building.
[75:01.33]New construction.
[75:03.81]Brand new.
[75:05.57]Oh, quick, play the piano before anybody figures it out.
[75:07.33]Uh-huh.
[75:17.57]Carry on with the meeting.
[75:18.91]I'll take care of the rest.
[75:19.71]Nice Family Guy joke.
[75:26.45]Wait.
[75:44.67]Carl, did you do that?
[75:46.25]I certainly did not.
[75:47.89]I have no idea what's going on.
[75:49.67]Is that just at my mercy?
[75:54.01]What's the meaning of this?
[75:55.83]You.
[75:56.85]You're the one responsible for all this.
[75:59.44]Gray, what do you want?
[76:01.60]Something that has been a long time due.
[76:04.60]Revenge.
[76:05.58]Revenge?
[76:08.04]How banal.
[76:09.32]You killed Cobb, Manacob, Caruso.
[76:13.75]I can't just stand up from behind this.
[76:15.37]Vertical video?
[76:16.45]Really, Carl?
[76:17.27]You're making us look real shitty here.
[76:19.53]You specifically?
[76:20.70]Nothing.
[76:20.96]Providence?
[76:22.22]Everything.
[76:39.28]Can't even save it.
[76:40.02]Zoom call.
[76:41.67]I kind of want to hit him with the apple and then let him get up and go.
[76:49.41]He turned off the video.
[76:50.85]Okay, right now he threw the apple at him.
[77:06.29]Why did you throw that apple at me?
[77:08.45]That was ridiculous.
[77:11.83]He's dead.
[77:12.25]Oh, I just skipped it.
[77:18.56]Does he fight back?
[77:19.30]Hey, it's me, 47.
[77:19.68]You're trapped in here with me.
[77:21.78]I'll tell you what happened.
[77:33.43]He is dead.
[77:34.99]Don't touch that.
[77:39.41]Oh shit he touched it.
[77:42.58]Oh shit.
[77:51.01]Get me to the exit quick.
[77:53.07]Get me to the exit.
[78:02.35]I thought I locked it.
[78:04.15]I thought I had it locked down.
[78:05.73]Oh Jesus All it took was for him to kick it and all the panels come back up No need to panic
[78:31.81]Tell me what to fucking do.
[78:36.19]Help me!
[78:38.69]Why did I do that?
[78:40.01]It was a... Just go to the meeting already.
[78:42.21]I need you to keep calm and do exactly what I tell you to, okay?
[78:47.44]Of course.
[78:47.68]I'll be clear.
[78:49.88]Now we'll just wait for the partners to be alone.
[78:52.96]Then you can activate the room's lockdown feature.
[78:57.66]Move towards the EZ.
[78:59.00]Don't look back.
[78:59.62]Run!
[79:02.34]I'm sorry.
[79:13.20]I'm sorry.
[79:13.94]I'm sorry.
[79:14.40]I'm sorry.
[79:14.78]I'm sorry.
[79:17.16]You're so bad at this.
[79:18.16]I just need to press buttons and throw things.
[79:20.23]Alright, let's go.
[79:25.53]Agent 47 IQ.
[79:32.01]You have a monkey brain.
[79:33.13]Yeah, I know.
[79:33.75]You guys know this.
[79:42.28]So I can do this cleanly by just dropping the chandelier on him.
[79:44.04]Are they going to shimmy around?
[79:46.50]Fuck.
[79:46.80]Don't get spotted.
[79:47.86]How you doing?
[80:03.36]A chef?
[80:06.12]There's a chef over here.
[80:08.13]Hold on.
[80:08.53]But there's a chef over there, dude.
[80:09.47]Hmm.
[80:32.47]I'm going to inhale sharply and you're going to lose consciousness because of your proximity to me.
[80:37.21]There won't be enough oxygen within this square meter.
[80:39.61]I just want a bottle of water.
[80:41.83]Who do you want to put money on, sir?
[80:44.99]I put money on me.
[80:47.39]Am I playing Skyrim?
[80:48.55]Why am I just taking everything in this guy's room?
[80:59.32]Okay, I got what I wanted.
[81:04.49]Just keep calm.
[81:14.50]Where's the Sheik?
[81:15.44]It's a busy day for him.
[81:17.08]Surely we can give him... What's this?
[81:24.34]Carl?
[81:25.97]Did you do that?
[81:26.87]I certainly did not.
[81:28.51]I have no idea what's going on.
[81:32.78]What?
[81:33.60]Chandelier.
[81:33.90]Meat on the chandelier.
[81:35.22]Meat on the chandelier.
[81:37.88]Fuck.
[81:38.10]Just wait.
[81:38.58]Wait, wait, wait.
[81:39.14]Fuck.
[81:40.00]Drop the chandelier, but...
[82:01.65]Ow.
[82:01.77]Do it now.
[82:02.25]What is this?
[82:02.51]Model of the scepter?
[82:03.15]That's a... Meat.
[82:03.63]Shoot it.
[82:03.83]But I don't want to activate the... Won't they hear this?
[82:25.20]What do you mean reset?
[82:30.53]Can I disguise as him?
[82:55.33]It hasn't been noticed.
[83:06.65]Shoot the chandelier.
[83:07.47]Yeah, I did, and it didn't do anything.
[83:08.83]It just, like, bounced off the metal.
[83:11.06]I wanted to hit him with a bone, too.
[83:14.62]Damn it.
[83:25.24]We meant the string.
[83:26.36]Yeah, I didn't know if it was the hitbox would be on the actual chandelier part too.
[83:30.20]Oh, let me drink some of that whiskey.
[83:34.68]Drop them behind the TV.
[83:35.96]Okay, I have to get out of here.
[83:41.74]Will they see the blood on the ground?
[83:44.44]What if I turn the... Wait, I didn't even get to use this.
[83:46.14]Alright, I'll hold it.
[83:49.21]I can't save it.
[83:52.89]How do I get out of here?
[84:03.21]I'm okay.
[84:03.63]No, just go.
[84:38.26]Oh shit.
[84:44.79]I'm close.
[84:45.31]I'm Sarah.
[84:45.79]Nobody over here, right?
[84:54.46]Oh, I opened the elevator.
[84:55.26]That's right.
[84:55.70]Nice.
[84:55.96]Okay, cool.
[85:23.31]Would I go too far?
[85:27.37]What happened?
[85:27.79]Oh, I did it.
[85:34.20]Wrong floor?
[85:38.16]This one here?
[85:38.60]Oh, it's right here.
[85:41.62]Wait, what?
[85:43.50]Wait, why is this...
[85:53.87]Right here?
[85:54.17]It's right here, right?
[86:02.92]Press the button?
[86:03.90]You have to press the elevator button?
[86:05.92]The elevator's already open!
[86:07.22]What?
[86:13.42]The elevator's open!
[86:14.40]I have to press the elevator button?
[86:17.68]Red Leader, area is clear.
[86:19.32]Please advise, over.
[86:31.50]Oh my God.
[86:32.18]He didn't even know.
[86:32.86]How did you... Give me a break.
[86:42.86]I thought I just had to walk in.
[86:45.86]Really?
[86:46.22]I walked in there.
[86:48.48]I had to hold G on the elevator button.
[86:50.80]I thought I was going to just walk in and it would be like, oh, you did it with the cutscene.
[87:07.77]Yeah, that's my name.
[87:09.23]I've never played Fortnite even for one minute.
[87:15.91]Not one single fucking minute.
[87:31.04]Nice.
[87:31.44]Alright, that was fun.
[87:34.02]A new melee?
[87:34.62]A hidden stash in the kitchen.
[87:41.70]The man behind the curtain.
[87:43.06]If that's your winning face, I'd hate to see you lose.
[87:55.61]We underestimated the constant.
[87:58.11]Nah, he's a glorified desk clerk.
[88:00.27]He's not just after the money.
[88:02.85]He wants it all.
[88:04.63]Anyone's feeling that eventually Kiefer Sutherland's going to replace him.
[88:08.77]Well, we're not the ones who let him escape.
[88:11.72]You still don't trust her.
[88:15.74]I don't like executive decision makers.
[88:21.11]Look, you don't have to follow her, you know?
[88:26.13]Soon, this will be over.
[88:28.01]This is a 2021 game.
[88:28.95]Maybe it's time to think about the future.
[88:31.72]Get out of here.
[88:32.24]You have to face the possibility that there's no good.
[88:34.32]What a way to ruin a cutscene.
[88:36.78]If the ICA knows what you did, she'll make it right.
[88:40.79]Oh my God, dude.
[88:45.51]Okay.
[88:45.71]That's the same exact thing.
[88:47.51]It just completely pulls you out.
[88:48.85]When you're at like a fast food restaurant and they have one of those digital menus and the windows update restart, please continue thing is in the middle.
[88:59.74]It's just, that's not supposed to be there.
[89:01.90]You're just completely removing from my fast food environment.
[89:07.24]Okay.
[89:07.42]Well, whatever.
[89:07.92]This is death of the family.
[89:29.99]Put those scissors... It's time to put the scissors down.
[89:33.42]I can't even... I keep thinking about that.
[89:38.38]You tend to be reminded of what truly matters.
[89:46.00]So, the end of the line.
[89:48.90]You ready for this?
[89:51.18]Are you?
[89:53.44]Who will you be without a score to settle?
[89:58.28]I guess the world's most wanted fugitive will have to do.
[90:04.63]Alexa Christine Carlisi.
[90:08.11]Alexa Carlyle is dead.
[90:10.87]According to the funeral invitation, that is.
[90:13.77]So naturally, it caused quite a Ster when the late matriarch turned up at the breakfast table, alive and kicking.
[90:20.20]So now we have to kill her.
[90:21.00]Carlyle, wisely sensing that her number is up, has emerged from exile to tie up loose ends and secure the Carlyle legacy.
[90:28.14]She may be a monster, but you have to admire her due diligence.
[90:32.59]Carlisle descends from an ancient line of warrior aristocrats.
[90:36.67]Her great-grandfather made a killing in the Second Opium War and established an empire in shipping, railroads, and newspaper publishing.
[90:44.34]While largely unknown to the public, the family still asserts its quiet dominance over global transport and logistics, media, and technology.
[90:53.29]Most senior of the partners, Alexa Carlisle is cold as ice, tough as nails, and sharp as a razor.
[91:00.83]But an apple will do, as always 47.
[91:02.55]Why is it on fire?
[91:02.97]Oh.
[91:03.13]We're doing like a big mansion mission?
[91:21.51]Eliminate.
[91:21.77]Alexa Carlyle.
[91:22.71]Cool.
[91:46.44]Alexa Carlyle find the case file and eliminate Alexa Carlyle Hmm Okay, hmm I want coins Coins smuggled item I want I don't have any unlocks classic outfit
[92:12.96]Boats, yeah.
[92:13.78]I like that.
[92:14.27]I like the way it looks.
[92:16.07]Let's go.
[92:23.85]It's a spooky mansion.
[92:24.91]I like the spooky mansion atmosphere.
[92:30.49]This looks fun.
[92:33.96]I like when they're self-contained in one spot.
[92:37.22]Give me that fucking motorcycle, please.
[92:40.03]The revenant, Alexa Carlyle, and her three adult children... You skipped a mission?
[92:43.90]What?
[92:44.84]Grandson and daughter-in-law are all gathered to conduct Carlyle's sham funeral.
[92:49.76]Wow.
[92:51.26]Curiously, Carlyle summoned a famous London PI soon after arriving this morning, but his purpose at Thornbridge is yet unclear.
[92:59.57]Now the target knows that you're coming and her guard detail is top.
[93:03.92]She knows I'm on the way.
[93:05.12]So Mr. Gray will secure their nearby field HQ and intercept all calls going in and out of the estate.
[93:11.58]Any appeal for backup is going to fall on very deaf ears.
[93:15.92]Good luck, gentlemen.
[93:17.98]No, give me that motorcycle, please.
[93:20.46]Please.
[93:20.98]No, please.
[93:30.95]Oh, this is gorgeous.
[93:33.05]This is beautiful.
[93:42.46]This is really, really pretty.
[93:43.62]Alright, the PI.

[95:33.50]I can't, like, step into the little river?
[95:35.54]I can't step- Why can I not walk in that?
[95:41.16]It's an invisible wall.
[95:41.86]I can't walk in the water.
[95:42.68]What do you mean, Jesus?
[95:45.10]No, I'm talking about dunking.
[95:46.68]I can't, like, dunk in here?
[95:47.86]I can't walk in here and dunk in this.
[95:50.06]Why?
[95:50.24]Why?

[100:06.10]My computer is hard crashing.
[100:08.12]My computer is hard.
[100:09.04]I think my computer is turning off.
[100:10.72]My computer is turning off.
[100:20.03]What the hell happened?
[100:24.59]Everything just crashed.
[100:25.33]My computer did.
[100:30.11]What the fuck?
[100:37.81]You ripped too big of a hole.
[100:39.15]Okay, let me restart it.
[100:43.92]I couldn't even see an indicator on my screen.
[100:48.68]I have a thing where it shows my mic level.
[100:51.82]My mic level shows up, right?
[100:54.70]And that wasn't even visible anymore.
[100:57.32]Everything turned off.
[101:01.88]Okay, well.
[101:08.58]Let's try that again.
[101:11.78]You are online.
[101:12.56]I don't want to be online.
[101:19.98]Sign up.
[101:20.80]Don't ever ask me again.
[101:21.82]Death and family.
[101:29.19]Okay, let's go.
[101:30.65]Load game, right?
[101:34.51]Just load game.
[101:39.97]Where the hell is load game?
[101:54.56]Age up.
[101:59.21]Oh, okay.
[102:02.09]How far away was this?
[102:02.99]Oh, okay.
[102:03.71]No, it's right here.
[102:04.35]We're fine.
[102:11.43]Oh, that was the lady.
[102:14.79]I thought that was another worker at the hotel or the mansion.
[102:17.88]I thought it was a worker.
[102:44.02]What does he have on him?
[102:46.02]What do you have on you?
[102:47.54]Anything?
[102:48.92]No.
[102:49.12]Alright.
[102:49.52]Where do I hide him?
[102:50.38]In that little closet?
[102:51.18]Somebody's going to see over here.
[102:53.70]What's in here?
[102:54.08]Can I dump him in here?
[102:57.38]I'm going to dump you in here.
[102:57.98]Come here.
[103:07.87]Where can I put him?
[103:11.39]Break open the... No, no, no, no.
[103:13.03]Where can I dump him?
[103:18.87]Does anybody come in here for any reason?
[103:21.31]Whoa.
[103:24.43]Uh, alright, well... Window, window, window.
[103:36.62]No, not window!
[103:37.50]There's a guy right here!
[103:38.42]Is this the only guy?
[103:49.69]Won't he see?
[103:50.21]Okay, I think I'm alright.
[104:12.60]I can't walk around with a saber, but I feel like if I was like a really esteemed private eye, I probably would.
[104:22.34]Can I just pretend to be Indiana Jones or something?
[104:26.48]You mean like Chris?
[104:27.94]He treated me like shit.
[104:30.25]Fine.
[104:34.67]I deserve romance.
[104:38.81]Meet Alex in the foyer.
[104:40.15]Oh, wait.
[104:43.97]I'm here.
[104:49.06]Mr. Whitmer, thank you for coming on such short notice.
[104:52.23]A great tragedy has fallen upon us and I need a quick resolution.
[104:56.61]Sure.
[104:56.71]Handled with absolute discretion.
[104:59.41]Whatever you need, I can do it.
[105:00.55]Discretion are my specialty.
[105:02.99]Very well.
[105:04.91]I suppose you will want to start at the crime scene.
[105:07.59]In my experience, a thorough examination of a potential crime scene
[105:13.08]Hello, Fernsby.
[105:13.88]How are you?
[105:14.58]Do I care?
[105:16.00]What?
[106:00.43]I could have just followed her up.
[106:02.44]I didn't have to listen to her.
[106:03.40]Hmm.
[106:03.54]I would.
[106:03.74]Let's go.
[106:03.96]Wait, like I was going up here anyways.
[106:37.13]I feel obliged to point out that current affairs surrounding Madam Carlyle are of a delicate nature.
[106:43.13]Are these her kids?
[106:43.97]Her?
[106:44.25]You may be familiar with the recent announcement of her death.
[106:47.11]Are these you?
[106:48.01]You will probably learn that the stage... That looks like you.
[106:50.63]...is scheduled to take place tomorrow.
[106:53.41]Madam's children were not informed until this morning that their mother was in fact not dead at all.
[106:58.40]Wow.
[106:58.82]So please bear with them if they seem affected by the rather unusual situation.
[107:03.18]Are they in the house?
[107:05.10]Trust I do not need to remind you that there will be consequences if word gets out that Madam Carlisle is still alive.
[107:12.97]I'll consider her dead when I leave.
[107:17.40]And then I nudge him really fucking hard into his waist and I wink a shitload of times.
[107:23.92]The case concerns the death of Mr. Zachary, Madam Carlisle's younger brother.
[107:29.19]Really?
[107:29.33]Hmm.
[107:29.69]Interesting.
[107:29.99]Sure.
[107:30.19]Had to do some detective work.
[107:31.43]Okay.
[107:32.17]Okay.
[108:00.98]Holy shit, I was going to say he disappeared.
[108:07.91]Hmm.
[108:08.07]It's a murder mystery?
[108:11.07]Don't I end up being the murderer at the end anyways?
[108:13.49]I'm the killer.
[108:15.71]Oh, what a twist.
[108:16.47]Is somebody in here?
[108:18.79]Oh, this person's dead.
[108:20.31]Is he going to tell me what happened to him?
[108:31.12]Throat markings indicate a rare short-lived plant poison killed him.
[108:36.82]Spread shows time of death at around 10 o'clock last night.
[108:40.44]I do know your poison's 47.
[108:42.68]Okay.
[108:44.14]We're looking for poison.
[108:46.38]There it is right here.
[108:47.18]He must have drank out of that.
[108:48.04]Just check that for poison.
[108:53.10]Whiskey glass and bottle found on Zachary Carlisle's bedside table.
[108:58.53]What else is down here?
[109:02.00]Oh, there's a fresh fire.
[109:04.70]This is very recent.
[109:06.87]There's a fresh fire over here.
[109:07.95]There's fresh wood.
[109:10.11]Computer.
[109:15.18]Yep.
[109:16.16]What was the last email he sent?
[109:24.95]Interesting.
[109:30.67]Okay.
[109:31.49]Interesting.
[109:35.25]Very interesting.
[109:40.45]And a bunch of Zorn tabs.
[109:42.85]Who's this?
[109:44.77]Who's this person?
[109:45.79]You're supposed to be the one that's like guarding this guy all night?
[109:48.69]Who are you?
[109:59.22]What about out here?
[109:59.66]A lot of booze.
[110:02.71]That's pretty much... Ooh, that's pretty.
[110:04.01]That's really pretty.
[110:13.26]Get me out of here before I do something stupid.
[110:18.12]What else is there?
[110:19.81]Oh.
[110:21.17]This looks like it can be opened.
[110:33.80]Let me tell you guys something.
[110:34.60]Let me give you guys a little bit of advice.
[110:36.76]If your Tinder profile is all this, delete them all now.
[110:42.64]Right now.
[110:43.50]Delete them all.
[110:44.02]You're going to need a few different photos.
[110:51.07]This is a swipe left.
[110:53.19]It just is.
[110:56.54]Set it up.
[110:57.34]Take a photo.
[110:58.04]Get a... Take like a selfie is better.
[111:00.82]The camera in the mirror is just... There's an immediate swipe left.
[111:04.36]I don't have to tell you that.
[111:06.52]You should know that by now.
[111:08.16]Especially if it looks like this too.
[111:19.33]You'd be a really bad wingman.
[111:22.37]Hold on.
[111:23.75]Wait, wait.
[111:24.15]Let's get this right.
[111:35.27]There.
[111:36.83]Good.
[111:38.37]Good.
[111:40.21]Perfect.
[111:40.51]I don't even know what the hell you look like.
[111:45.67]Bad wingman?
[111:46.53]That's a good tip.
[111:47.41]That's a good tip.
[111:48.83]That's a good tip, okay?
[111:55.37]What else we got?
[111:55.89]Alright, get this stupid filter off.
[112:01.01]Investigate the room.
[112:02.07]But what else is there?
[112:05.87]The blood stains?
[112:06.83]Shoes.
[112:08.25]He was looking for those.
[112:09.49]White.
[112:09.77]Something hidden under here.
[112:13.16]Anything else in this bed?
[112:14.72]Telephone.
[112:15.06]Can anything be interacted with?
[112:25.77]Wait.
[112:32.57]The computer again?
[112:35.31]Oh, there's a note here.
[112:38.71]It's a handwriting sample.
[112:42.93]Oh, we see if it's a forged signature.
[112:44.01]Okay, I get it.
[113:06.87]Forged signature.
[113:10.04]What else is in here?
[113:18.80]Does he have a pair of shoes in here?
[113:19.82]I don't see anything else to interact with.
[113:29.21]Climb?
[113:34.01]The hat.
[113:42.63]There's a lemon over here.
[113:43.62]That's a kitchen knife.
[113:49.90]Is it my trolling?
[113:51.00]No.
[113:51.18]What am I supposed to be looking for?
[113:52.96]Turn around.
[113:56.71]There's a big book over here.
[114:02.77]Bookshelf?
[114:07.50]Go to the bookshelf.
[114:11.16]Bookshelf next to the ladder.
[114:16.16]Oh, the ladder was like blocking this.
[114:17.42]Oh, alright.
[114:20.72]Peep?
[114:22.54]Oh, this is... Can somebody see my eyeball?
[114:26.19]Let's just stop pretending.
[114:48.34]Okay, we got another note.
[114:49.54]Floor plan.
[114:51.68]A photocopy of the floor plan.
[114:56.66]Floor plan of Thornbridge Manor detailing several hidden rooms and passages.
[115:00.12]One which connects to Zachary Carlisle's bedroom.
[115:02.75]Somebody's been researching the secret ins and outs of Thornbridge Manor.
[115:06.83]This is a two-way mirror.
[115:08.03]I believe you've done a thorough search of the crime scene, 47.
[115:11.85]Maybe it's time to see the butler.
[115:14.35]I'm curious about the information he's prepared for you.
[115:22.30]Oh, close that.
[115:22.76]I want people to know I know what this is.
[115:23.89]Mystery switch.
[115:29.05]Save it.
[115:29.27]Alright, you got info.
[115:38.97]This is cool.
[115:39.57]A little investigation.
[115:43.74]This is fun.
[115:49.24]Alright, what do you got for me?
[115:51.20]I got some info for you.
[115:52.84]The signature was forged.
[115:53.97]Hmm, hidden passages though.
[115:55.61]Gonna have to bring you in.
[116:18.35]Well... Let's investigate that.
[116:20.25]No, I was... I don't have an alibi.
[116:21.83]I was in... I was I was in Zachary's bedroom, murdering him with poison.
[116:25.51]Oh, no!
[116:25.65]Oops, sorry.
[116:26.09]Okay, very useful.
[116:26.85]Who's this?
[116:27.09]Gregory Carlyle.
[116:48.31]The oldest child of Alexa Carlisle.
[116:49.95]Gregory is a suspect in the murder of Zachary Carlisle.
[116:53.45]Rebecca Carlisisle.
[116:54.69]The youngest child of Alexa Carlisle.
[116:56.19]Rebecca is a suspect.
[116:58.57]Emma Carlisle.
[117:00.41]The wife of Gregory.
[117:02.65]Patrick, the son of Emma.
[117:04.88]And Mr. Fernsby.
[117:06.26]Butler at Thornbridge Manor.
[117:07.66]Mr. Fernsby is a suspect in the murder of Zachary Carlisle.

[117:43.39]Oh, okay.
[117:43.73]There's the son.

[117:44.91]Okay.
[117:58.55]Mr. Patrick, can I do anything for you?
[118:01.59]Yes, actually.
[118:03.05]Could you speed up time so I don't die from.
[118:06.73]I fear I may not survive an entire weekend in this shithole.
[118:10.65]Perhaps a brisk walk in the garden would do you good.
[118:13.12]I said speed up time, not my passing.
[118:16.62]I'll just go away with you.
[118:18.08]Of course, sir.
[118:19.14]Okay, let's question him.
[118:20.62]How very kind of you, dear Mr. Furnsby.

[121:16.56]Are they underneath me?
[121:22.07]Where are they?
[121:22.47]I can hear them talking through the wall.

[121:28.33]Alright, I'll solve the puzzle.
[121:34.99]Let me see who actually did the killing.
[121:36.14]And then we're going to get them all in a room.
[121:39.44]And I'm just going to just throw.
[121:40.46]Like axes at them.
[121:43.10]I don't know.
[121:43.66]You know what I do.
[121:44.46]You know how I do it.
[121:48.31]I'm the private.
[121:50.21]I'm the private investigator.
[121:51.31]I can't.
[121:53.31]I can't go up here.

[122:28.76]Questioned you.
[122:29.46]You were like with a girl somewhere, right?
[122:32.40]Alright, where are you?
[122:33.04]I'm looking for Emma.
[122:43.37]This is a big ass house.
[122:48.13]Where were both of you?
[122:50.87]Oh, wait, you're not... I thought you were kids.
[123:09.22]Somebody in the garden?
[123:10.23]Is that a brick?
[123:10.85]Holy shit.
[123:11.51]Best item in the game.
[123:12.15]Thank God.
[123:13.19]I thought they were like the... I don't know.
[123:16.15]I thought they were the kids.
[123:17.29]Like her kids.
[123:17.73]The people that could be killers.
[123:35.88]Give somebody a brick massage.
[123:38.42]What does that even mean?
[123:39.48]Alright, I'm looking for more people to talk to.
[123:43.58]Somebody out in like the garden?
[124:08.94]I have to investigate.
[124:09.70]I can't just have things given to me.
[124:11.58]Okay.
[124:19.85]Okay.
[124:37.51]Oh, the butler.
[124:39.91]So the butler and Rebecca have half of a key.
[124:57.99]It's good to know.
[124:58.51]And that's how you get into the safe.
[125:02.23]Trophy room.
[125:04.85]Ooh, hello there.
[125:07.32]Rebecca, I see.
[125:11.82]What's your story?
[125:12.95]Lie.
[125:13.03]Lie, how would you know that?
[125:38.72]He snuck away to hang out with a girl.
[125:40.72]Lie.
[125:40.98]How would you know that?
[125:43.72]I swear Gregory enjoys Edward's discomfort over staying here.
[125:47.58]I had a conference call with my New York office at 9.
[125:50.38]Oh, 9?
[125:50.78]We're Pacific time.
[125:51.34]10, 11, 12.
[125:51.48]Did you talk to somebody at 12 a.m.?
[125:52.66]All those offices are closed.
[125:53.82]Lie.
[125:53.94]She did act a bit strange.
[126:03.75]That's a lie too.
[126:16.05]Tell me about Zachary.
[126:17.99]Did he act strange last night?
[126:19.93]You know, now you mention it, he was a lot more chatty than usual.
[126:24.60]He wanted to know about my connections in the publishing business.
[126:28.14]Where'd you get these?
[126:29.26]Apparently, a friend of his is writing a book.
[126:32.06]Where'd you get those?
[126:33.02]Which strikes me as very peculiar.
[126:34.88]I didn't think he had any friends.
[126:36.24]Is that everything, Mr. Whitmer?
[126:37.34]Where'd you get those?
[126:38.32]I do have a lot to see to.
[126:39.35]Where'd you get them?
[126:42.65]Anything else you feel like mentioning?
[126:45.25]I may be wrong, but I saw Mr. Fernsby, the butler, leave Zachary's room early this afternoon.
[126:53.47]And he seemed a bit startled when he saw me in the hallway.
[126:57.25]It's probably nothing.
[126:58.61]Oh, and one more thing.
[127:01.36]Please be kind to Edward.
[127:04.00]He can only take so much.
[127:11.50]Okay.
[127:12.32]Thank you for the help.
[127:13.94]Now we know we need to talk to Edward.
[127:15.76]I'm probably just going to get fed up that I'm trying to talk to people that I need to find.
[127:27.41]And I'm going to not find one family member and I'm just not going to care.
[127:29.59]I'm just going to go up and shoot her in the head.
[127:33.33]Ooh, a garden fork.
[127:34.01]Nice.
[127:44.16]Alright, somebody else down here.
[127:45.17]Revealing a mission?
[127:47.19]What?
[127:50.73]Ooh.
[127:52.75]Bring the whole family together?
[127:56.65]And just explode the camera?
[128:15.00]Oh, that's... Shit.
[128:16.62]Okay, hold on.
[128:19.70]But I'm supposed to be investigating a murder right now.
[128:28.70]Hold on.
[128:29.44]There's too many things to do.
[128:35.03]What's... Who's in here?
[128:38.23]Solve the murder.
[128:39.19]I want to take a picture of people.
[128:42.23]Nice.
[128:42.49]Okay.
[129:11.28]Solve the murder.
[129:12.08]Solve the murder.
[129:12.94]I will solve the murder.
[129:14.01]Okay.
[129:14.47]I'm going to solve the murder.
[129:15.83]Can I at least kill the photographer?
[129:21.49]You guys.
[129:24.11]Holy shit.
[129:26.17]Holy shit.
[129:32.22]Damn it.
[129:37.78]Alright.
[129:37.96]Where's the map?
[129:38.38]I want to see where people are.
[129:41.02]I need... What's this?
[129:45.50]Area undiscovered.
[129:46.30]Alright, I'm going to go back in.
[129:47.16]I have two or three more people to talk to.
[129:50.30]Yeah, hey bro.
[129:51.94]Hey.
[129:52.24]What's going on, bro?
[129:56.20]A safe in Madame Carlyle's office.
[129:59.23]I bet that's where she... Keeps the file on Arthur Edwards.
[130:10.87]I'm sure it is.
[130:11.41]Alright, let's go.
[130:11.95]I want to question some more.
[130:12.81]I questioned you.
[130:17.61]Did I go this way?
[130:20.31]Who else is left to talk to?
[130:24.10]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[130:37.56]well I spent the evening with my family but I got an awful migraine and had to take to bed everyone can attest to that I believe I went up when the boys sat down for a drink around eight o'clock is that all how do you feel about Zachary I might as well be honest his presence was always awkward
[130:57.98]How do you have a meaningful conversation with a man who only cares about plants?
[131:01.35]What's the strongest poison?
[131:03.19]In my opinion, Alexa bears some responsibility for how this ended.
[131:07.94]She supported his self-limiting behavior by letting him live here.
[131:12.20]Anything else you want?
[131:13.42]Have you noticed anything else out of the ordinary?
[131:15.94]Nothing special comes to mind.
[131:17.46]Except perhaps I did get a feeling that Zachary was depressed, not just sad.
[131:25.28]I suppose he realized that he had no one with Alexa gone.
[131:29.28]Even Alexa must feel the pangs of guilt over that one, letting him believe she was dead.
[131:35.73]Then again,
[131:36.64]guilt isn't her strong suit okay hmm we'll go over this so we need uh there's a couple more people to question like you you mind if I sit Gregory carlisle can you tell me where you were yesterday evening oh you're wondering about my alibi Mr. detective
[131:59.50]Well, I left Thornbridge around half eight for a pint with Edward.
[132:05.75]He's like scratching his ass on his couch.
[132:08.91]On the other hand, staying here with Zachary, my obnoxious sister, and the wife sporting another one of her headaches would have been a fate worse than death.
[132:17.85]The short of it, Zachary was very much alive when we left.
[132:22.52]I stayed for the last shout and I was back here just before midnight.
[132:27.38]Why?
[132:29.23]Here's the thing, guys.
[132:30.95]All of them did it.
[132:32.55]They all walked in different times of the night and stabbed him with a different knife.
[132:40.97]One of them poisoned him.
[132:41.95]One of them strangled him.
[132:43.59]One of them shot a dart into his neck.
[132:47.00]One of them just shot him.
[132:48.22]They all did it.
[132:50.78]Tell me about Zachary.
[132:52.14]Zach?
[132:54.24]Such a sad old sod.
[132:56.62]A bit heavy on the bottom.
[132:57.83]One of them bricked him.
[133:00.39]Somebody gave him a really rough brick massage.
[133:03.77]Who travels more than she stays here.
[133:06.51]Honestly, I can't say which is the bigger ball.
[133:09.05]He's better off dead.
[133:12.05]Anything else you'd like to tell me?
[133:13.71]Nothing really.
[133:15.73]I'm just enjoying the show.
[133:17.79]You're a fucking weirdo.
[133:18.47]Okay.
[133:18.73]We have one more person to question.
[133:20.23]We need to question Flanders.
[133:22.18]Edward Carlyle, the middle child of Alexa.
[133:23.92]Edward's a suspect.
[133:47.30]Alright, where are you?
[133:51.44]One more to question.
[133:52.34]Wait, wait, hold on.
[133:55.08]What's that?
[133:55.82]Poison?
[134:03.41]Where is he?
[134:07.29]Whoop.
[134:08.53]What?
[134:25.64]I had one more thing to ask.
[134:26.96]One last question.
[134:27.86]Alexa, dim the lights.
[134:28.75]Where's Flanders?
[134:29.49]There he is.
[135:20.61]Where were you?
[135:26.30]Where was I?
[135:27.22]What was that save?
[135:29.50]Uh-oh.
[135:33.06]18.
[135:33.92]Which one?
[135:34.34]Where is it?
[135:34.88]This one?
[135:39.50]Just go on a rampage.
[135:40.48]No, I want to do this right.
[135:42.22]I want to do a mission correctly for once.
[135:47.79]May I help?
[135:59.72]This is a beautiful song.
[136:07.48]Excuse me.
[136:10.38]Can you get back to work, please?
[136:11.60]Come on.
[136:21.99]That was beautiful.
[136:23.51]Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.
[136:26.59]There.
[136:32.15]That deserves at least two bricks.
[136:35.13]God damn it.
[136:35.99]I'm sorry.
[136:36.73]I know.
[136:37.35]I have to fuck.
[136:38.35]What just happened?
[136:41.04]That deserves a brick massage.
[136:44.79]Wait, he's not dead.
[136:45.57]Wait, they just watched that.
[136:54.40]Okay, I need to see.
[136:55.98]If he gets up and plays the piano when he wakes up, I'm going to fucking shit my pants.
[137:02.37]How long does it take to wake up?
[137:25.44]Is there a way to wake him up faster?
[137:27.00]Can I go over and like... I mean, I hit him in the face with a brick.
[137:33.44]I don't think he's getting up for a long time.
[137:47.81]Don't do it.
[137:58.05]Just solve the murder.
[137:58.93]I'm working on it.
[138:02.61]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[138:04.73]We have to just listen to this.
[138:11.40]I dropped a chandelier on him.
[138:15.08]I'm not going to brick him.
[138:16.00]I already did that and I'm not going to ruin it.
[138:20.96]Holy shit, I got a great photo opportunity here.
[138:29.35]What?
[138:30.49]Stand up straight like a grown-up, for Christ's sake.
[138:33.51]You were just playing... That's all it took you to... Stand up.
[138:40.80]Come here.
[138:41.26]Professor Edward Carlyle.
[138:43.38]Can you tell me your whereabouts for last night?
[138:46.28]Oh, yes.
[138:46.96]This dreadful business with Zachary.
[138:50.40]I stay at the local inn.
[138:51.92]You see, I prefer not to spend the night here at Stonebridge Manor.
[138:55.50]My brother Gregory came along for a nightcap.
[138:58.12]He'll never admit it, but I think he... He understands that I find this whole thing upsetting.
[139:04.91]He wanted to provide some comfort.
[139:07.61]I believe we went to the stag's head around half past eight.
[139:12.03]That's all?
[139:13.05]I have a speech to write?
[139:14.25]Can you tell me about Zachary's behavior last night?
[139:17.03]I'm a detective.
[139:17.59]I have to take photos.
[139:20.34]Sure, he was upset by Mother's supposed death.
[139:24.56]We were.
[139:26.29]Hmm.
[139:26.45]I did talk to Rebecca already.
[139:27.58]Your last.
[139:28.44]Hmm.
[139:28.56]Interesting.
[139:43.30]Hmm.
[139:43.40]Okay.
[139:43.56]Okay, what's going- Why are these blocked out?
[140:17.75]Wait, did I clear these guys?
[140:21.85]Yes.
[140:22.35]Hi, Cassie.
[140:23.29]It's me again.
[140:24.69]Edward.
[140:26.17]I know I'm not supposed to leave you messages, and this is the last time, I promise.
[140:30.89]It's just... I don't know how to handle this.
[140:34.31]I've got to go.
[140:35.13]Sorry, I'll stop calling you.
[140:36.63]Oh, no, no, go ahead.
[140:37.17]I don't know how to handle this whole situation.
[140:40.32]He changed his mind.
[140:41.40]I can't feel my legs, and my eyes are not working properly.
[140:45.32]Sorry, got to run.
[140:46.12]Sorry.
[140:51.02]That's the most unsure phone call I've ever heard.
[140:54.24]I don't know how to handle this whole situation.
[140:57.06]I don't think I can really.
[140:58.78]I can't feel my legs.
[141:00.15]My eyes are not working properly.
[141:02.23]This flicker thing again.
[141:04.35]Oh, gotta go.
[141:05.13]Sorry, I'll stop calling you.
[141:07.17]I don't know how to handle this whole situation.
[141:09.99]I don't think I can really.
[141:11.69]I can't feel my legs.
[141:13.06]My eyes are not working properly.
[141:15.14]This flicker thing again.
[141:18.08]You can't tell anyone.
[141:20.18]The thing is, I've been asked to perform the eulogy at the funeral event tomorrow.
[141:24.44]I know it all sounds so unbelievable.
[141:26.66]But even though Mother is still alive, we still have to go through with the funeral.
[141:30.65]I have to write the eulogy.
[141:32.87]I don't think I can...
[141:34.28]Should I write the eulogy for him?
[141:35.50]I can do it for you.
[141:36.08]I'll do it.
[142:01.14]I'm sorry.
[142:01.64]I know.
[142:02.40]Uh, hang up.
[142:05.34]Not supposed to do this.
[142:07.84]Christ.
[142:08.62]Sorry.
[142:09.08]Uh, gotta go.
[142:11.12]Sorry.
[142:11.54]I'll stop recording.
[142:13.08]I'm sorry.
[142:13.58]No.
[142:15.54]Uh, hang up.
[142:16.88]Okay.
[142:21.54]Stop.
[142:22.08]Stop.
[142:22.48]Stop.
[142:23.60]I'm sorry.
[142:24.08]Sorry.
[142:24.54]I'm sorry.
[142:25.08]Sorry.
[142:25.64]Sorry.
[142:26.06]I'm sorry.
[142:26.48]Uh, sorry.
[142:28.81]I can't.
[142:29.17]I can't see.
[142:29.86]Sorry.
[142:30.32]Sorry.
[142:30.68]Sorry.
[142:31.24]Okay.
[142:31.56]That was a very long hang up.
[142:32.60]Did I clear him?
[142:33.24]Okay.
[142:33.36]Who has not been cleared?
[142:35.04]This is the important part.
[142:36.38]Intel.
[142:36.52]Intel.
[142:56.04]Suspects.
[142:57.44]Alright.
[142:58.54]The... I gotta talk to... I have to go talk to the butler.
[143:06.81]I gotta talk to the butler.
[143:08.81]Where is he?
[143:09.65]There he is.
[143:10.17]That fucking snake.
[143:20.60]Wait.
[143:20.80]Conclude investigation.
[143:22.46]Quit it.
[143:23.14]Now.
[143:24.36]Come on.
[143:24.62]Stand up.
[143:29.50]Come on and stand up.
[143:30.92]Come on, put your hands up.
[143:32.42]Come on and stand up.
[143:36.14]Hmm?
[143:42.09]That is the door to Rebecca's room.
[143:44.69]Is it?
[143:44.89]How do I get in?
[143:48.17]Oh, secret, secret, secret, secret, secret, secret, secret.
[143:50.14]There's secrets, there's secrets, there's secrets.
[143:52.22]There's secrets.
[143:53.34]Hey, there are secrets.
[144:15.63]Nobody in there.
[144:16.29]Alright.
[144:16.85]I'm really going to be able to investigate now.
[144:24.75]Oh, boy.
[144:25.69]Rebecca's room.
[144:26.81]Rebecca's laptop.
[144:28.01]Rebecca's... Okay.
[144:31.57]Here we go.
[144:32.21]Right to the computer.
[144:32.85]Checks out.
[144:45.92]Okay.
[144:46.38]That checks out.
[144:50.42]Yeah.
[144:51.86]Her alibi checks out.
[144:58.86]A notebook here.
[145:02.90]Rebecca Carlisle's notebook found in the bedroom in which she is staying.
[145:05.41]The notes concern various Carlisle assets as well as a board meeting from the night before.
[145:10.57]The handwriting does not match Zachary's suicide note.
[145:14.19]We have cleared Rebecca.
[145:16.65]She's been pretty much cleared completely.
[145:19.07]Although she's kind of a slob.
[145:24.64]Just going to leave that there.
[145:26.14]Only thing she is guilty of is major disorganizational skills.
[145:46.05]Alright, I think she's clear.
[145:46.97]I don't think there's anything else to look at.
[145:50.37]Wait, what's behind the painting?
[145:51.45]The dog.
[145:56.21]Oh, man.
[146:05.43]We're going to catch somebody talking about something, aren't we?
[146:09.99]I feel like that's what's going to happen.
[146:18.44]Oh, I can.
[146:24.28]Oh, my God.
[146:24.84]Is that me?
[146:26.10]Yes, I'm still here.
[146:28.90]It doesn't exist.
[146:29.96]What do you mean it doesn't exist?
[146:34.06]Right.
[146:34.57]I can go in here?
[146:35.03]I'll double check.
[146:36.23]I'm not allowed in here.
[146:37.21]What?
[146:37.49]I'm not allowed in.
[146:38.27]Excuse me.
[146:38.99]What are you doing here?
[146:41.39]I need you to follow me.

[148:10.02]Alright, just stop.
[148:24.38]You've been in a horrible accident.
[148:27.66]I should have shot him in the head when she said that.
[148:30.44]Alright, here we go.
[148:36.01]It's an accident.
[148:36.61]He fell out of the window.
[148:37.95]It's okay.
[148:38.33]He fell out of the window.
[148:40.85]He tripped out of the window.
[148:42.25]Got it.
[148:42.39]Okay.
[149:07.66]No, I'm supposed to... Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[149:09.08]I need to be the investigator.
[149:29.00]Send the picture to him and then strangle him.
[149:38.51]What?
[149:38.81]What, did that solve the mystery?
[149:39.97]They're not going to come in here, are they?
[149:41.27]Am I still trespassing if I leave that room?
[149:43.21]Okay, we're good.
[150:05.03]Reload.
[150:05.25]What, I didn't do it right?
[150:07.14]I don't know who did that.
[150:08.18]Hey, are you...
[150:43.20]You're aiming at her.
[150:58.87]Just use the peephole.
[151:01.78]No, I need it immediately.
[151:04.56]Yes, I'll hold.
[151:08.98]Yes, I'm still here.
[151:11.86]She got up quick after getting hit.
[151:13.36]Can we just say?
[151:17.89]I threw a brick into her head and she was up immediately.
[151:20.17]What's he doing?
[151:45.30]This is another mission.
[151:47.80]Oh.
[151:52.84]Well, I need to get more intel.
[152:04.87]Oh, Jesus.
[152:06.01]Okay.
[152:13.93]He's going to see me.
[152:14.51]I just want to leave.
[152:33.05]I can't do it again?
[152:37.83]Why?
[152:40.94]Why can I not... These guys don't exist anymore.
[152:47.19]What the hell?
[152:49.99]What?
[152:51.03]Okay, I'm afraid to say we got some trouble coming.
[153:00.80]Why can't I just throw apples at them?
[153:12.84]What am I doing?
[153:16.35]I... What am I doing?
[153:26.87]I'm just going to leave.
[153:27.44]I'm just kidding.
[153:28.42]Alright.
[153:28.78]So don't do this mission.
[153:30.14]There's no reason to.
[153:56.24]I've cleared... So it's one of these three people.
[154:03.54]It's either Emma, Patrick, or Mr. Furnsby.
[154:10.92]What was that?
[154:11.30]Did somebody just get crushed in there?
[154:16.79]So we did Emma's room.
[154:18.77]Let's go over here.
[154:22.01]There is a room over here.
[154:31.05]This way, right?
[154:33.01]Straight ahead.
[154:37.00]Whose room is down here?
[154:42.34]No?
[154:43.08]Is this a new area?
[154:49.82]Where's this other room?
[154:52.78]Area undiscovered.
[154:53.74]What is it?
[154:56.22]Wait, is it behind this?
[155:01.68]What is over here?
[155:02.24]Is it the first floor?
[155:13.11]It must be wall, Dad.
[155:20.80]Okay, what about down here?
[155:24.02]Staff room.
[155:26.14]Alright, I didn't check anything on the other side.
[155:27.63]Let's do that.
[155:30.68]He's in here.
[155:31.96]Should I follow him around?
[155:32.74]Are these rooms upstairs?
[155:46.27]No, this is level zero.
[155:47.11]Here we go.
[155:54.49]Staff room.
[155:56.73]I was in...
[156:01.19]How do I get in here?
[156:05.91]Wait, should I... Camera icons on the map?
[156:15.70]Oh, shit, okay.
[156:18.18]Get in there with a brick.
[156:19.40]What is in there?
[156:20.12]Okay.
[156:29.76]And then this big funeral thing tomorrow.
[156:32.46]It's the last thing I need.
[156:33.82]Amy is a great lass.
[156:35.14]You love her, she loves you.
[156:37.19]Ask about Patrick?
[156:39.21]Rosie, tell me what you did last night.
[156:41.29]I'm in trouble, aren't I?
[156:44.81]I spent the evening with Patrick.
[156:47.55]We met after dinner and I went home at one in the morning.
[156:50.24]He said he needed someone real to talk to.
[156:54.82]When he looks at you, it makes you feel like the center of the universe.
[156:58.66]Like a real princess.
[157:00.14]But now he just ignores her.
[157:02.78]He's under a lot of pressure.
[157:04.38]He's an idiot.
[157:05.70]That's what he is.
[157:06.64]Okay.
[157:11.14]That clears you.
[157:13.59]It's definitely the butler.
[157:14.63]It's always the butler.
[157:16.03]Or it's Emma.
[157:19.29]I remember I was with the first one.
[157:21.88]It's the butler.
[157:22.36]Except it was both of them.
[157:23.46]They work together.
[157:24.08]What did she say?
[157:39.23]I'm going to throw you under the bus.
[157:40.05]Hmm.
[157:40.17]Really?
[157:40.39]Can I get a photo for evidence, please?
[157:42.35]Purposes?
[157:42.69]Thank you.
[157:43.39]Okay, so it was Emma.
[157:44.91]It was Emma and the butler that worked together.
[157:46.98]Right.
[157:47.16]Got it.
[158:14.05]Yes, of course I'll take a fish.
[158:15.03]Are you kidding me?
[158:15.85]I'll take both.
[158:16.29]What else you got?
[158:19.77]Pause dinner so that degenerate can eat dinner.
[158:20.87]Are you really that- I just turned the fucking stove off.
[158:23.21]Are you kidding me?

[159:06.31]Yeah, thank God
[159:15.65]You ripped off the dial.
[159:19.33]That happened to me at Thanksgiving.
[159:23.01]You turned the stove off.
[159:24.97]And every single person in the room all stood up out of their tables and exclamation points went on their heads.
[159:31.84]What's going on there?
[159:32.48]What are you doing?
[159:33.60]Don't do that.

[160:38.36]We were sitting on the bench behind the greenhouse talking.
[160:41.47]I don't care about my connections.
[160:42.87]Stay offline.
[160:43.59]Okay.
[160:44.93]Now get me the hell out of here.
[160:48.04]Before I continue to get myself in trouble.
[160:51.20]Alright.
[160:51.60]I need to catch.
[161:13.07]Them doing something.
[161:15.41]Emma.
[161:16.29]She's seen nothing out of the ordinary.
[161:18.49]Except that Zachary appeared depressed.
[161:20.91]Emma says Zachary's company was always awkward due to all his consuming fascination with plants.
[161:25.48]Plants.
[161:26.94]She considers Madame Carla at least partially responsible.
[161:30.16]Okay, plants.
[161:32.14]Got plants.
[161:37.54]What do we got in here?
[161:38.43]Okay, where's that camera?
[161:45.05]This is a bag of sugar.
[161:46.07]It looks kind of like a camera.
[161:55.82]Something in here I can take a picture of.
[161:57.22]Oh.
[161:59.02]Whatever that is.
[162:00.00]No?
[162:00.10]What can I take a picture of in here?
[162:09.30]Piano?
[162:09.64]The book on the piano?
[162:10.47]Oh, he's writing the thing.
[162:12.31]Oh.
[162:38.79]Nice.
[162:39.05]Can I take a picture of him here?
[162:46.97]Up here.
[163:02.16]Something in the closet?
[163:03.40]Wait a minute.
[163:03.90]Is he signing this?
[163:04.54]Oh, shit.
[163:04.88]He is.
[163:05.18]What was it?
[163:05.85]Ah, they're the same handwriting.
[163:32.42]He's clear.
[163:43.39]He's already been eliminated, so we don't need to even be in here.
[163:46.37]Alright, what about the sitting room?
[163:51.95]Coming in here?
[163:52.51]No, this way.
[163:59.37]What is in here?
[164:00.67]You are a suspect.
[164:01.65]Does he sign his own newspaper?
[164:02.39]What's that?
[164:03.17]I can't use a fire poker.
[164:03.75]Something to take a picture of in here.
[164:05.17]Bell?
[164:27.69]There's something in here to take a picture of.
[164:30.34]Is it back here?
[164:31.64]Hmm.
[164:31.86]Is it on the table?
[164:34.66]Hold on.
[164:57.34]Big thing of lemonade?
[164:59.80]I could push her out right now.
[165:03.20]Painting?
[165:09.00]Painting.
[165:09.40]Of Walt Disney?
[165:12.48]Portrait of Montgomery Carlisle.
[165:19.48]What does that do for me, though?
[165:27.45]That didn't do anything.
[165:36.42]You're clear.
[165:36.92]Alright, in the trophy room, there's something to take a picture of in the trophy room.
[165:42.90]What is it?
[165:43.16]Birds?
[165:50.07]Birds?
[165:56.61]Poison?
[165:57.15]Missing poison.

[166:48.18]They're about to bury her fake body.
[166:56.24]Oh, this is another mission.
[167:00.51]This is her funeral, right?
[167:01.69]This is what?

[167:44.77]Let's go in your office.
[167:45.57]Should I go back upstairs?
[167:57.07]Let's go up in your office and we'll figure it out.

[169:37.32]What?
[169:37.76]Balcony, what the fuck?
[169:38.58]Somebody said, go on the roof.
[169:41.72]A bunch of you guys are saying, go to the roof.
[169:45.74]I want to investigate.
[169:51.49]I think 500 of you wrote, go on the roof.
[169:55.85]I'm like, yeah, maybe I will.
[170:02.54]Somebody said, go through the sunroof.
[170:08.10]There's nobody in here.
[170:15.88]What's that?
[170:22.21]Nothing in that... Oh, my God.

[170:58.51]Shoes.
[170:59.49]I knew it.
[171:01.45]I knew it.
[171:03.43]Shoes and footprints found in Emma and Gregory's room.
[171:05.79]And would you look at that?
[171:10.40]I solved it.
[171:12.30]You are footprints.
[171:13.56]You stepped in mud.
[171:15.64]And you dragged it all the way over to the other room.
[171:19.46]Right?
[171:26.95]What's even in here?
[171:36.89]Um...
[171:44.95]There's more.

[172:40.10]Apparently the two murderers were unaware that Emma's mother was expecting his child.
[172:44.14]There's the smoking gun.
[173:01.02]Hmm.
[173:01.10]Wow.
[173:01.20]Wow!
[173:01.74]What's that?
[173:38.36]I don't know what's happening.
[173:39.10]I don't either.
[173:39.48]I just was kind of nodding.
[173:44.44]Emma's got it out for everybody.
[173:46.51]That's what's happening.
[173:53.21]He's got to prove it.
[173:59.82]He's talking about plants.
[174:01.24]Where's the greenhouse?
[174:04.26]Where's the greenhouse?
[174:05.12]I want the greenhouse.
[174:08.65]I'm going over here.
[174:09.15]I gotta get into the butler's room?
[174:20.46]Yeah, I know.
[174:20.82]Let me go on the roof first.
[174:21.66]Get the key, you fuck.
[174:26.66]Come on.
[174:27.91]Go to the luggage.
[174:29.27]Ah!
[174:29.51]What are we doing?
[174:35.11]This is bad.
[174:41.58]What do you want to do with the luggage?
[174:45.56]Oh, thank God I got the key to the greenhouse.
[174:48.60]Hmm.

[175:13.86]I want to go on the roof.
[175:24.94]Get over here.
[175:31.36]Trespassing on the roof.
[175:32.58]Sure.
[175:32.78]This is a really cool view, but it doesn't really do anything for me.
[176:04.20]THC tincture.
[176:05.76]No.
[176:14.21]No, you fucking assholes.
[176:15.95]I can't reach it.
[176:17.71]I can't reach that.
[176:19.16]Oh my god.
[176:27.22]I'm just gonna burn my ass.
[176:28.34]I don't even care.
[176:28.88]Go all wheezy.
[176:34.36]I want to go to the greenhouse.
[176:40.47]I just fall from here.
[176:42.85]Can't fall.
[176:44.09]Why?
[176:47.67]Shoot the ladder.
[176:48.94]I'm going to shoot the ladder and alert the entire mansion.
[176:53.30]Shoot.
[176:53.54]I'm not going to shoot the ladder.
[176:54.92]What are you crazy?
[177:18.67]Here you are.
[177:19.71]Okay.
[177:21.33]I want to get out.
[177:21.95]I want to go across.
[177:23.59]I want to go to the greenhouse.
[177:24.37]There's going to be a plant in there.
[177:26.49]It's going to be a poisonous plant.
[177:30.29]Hey, what's up?
[177:31.71]Murderer.
[177:38.37]How are you today, sir?
[177:42.36]Listen to this, Emma.

[178:20.69]I have the key chain, but I don't have the key.
[178:22.75]But you'll open this for me.
[178:24.51]You'll open this door for me.
[178:25.41]You must have the key.
[178:28.78]Can you get in there?
[178:33.02]I have the... Hold on.
[178:34.56]I have the key chain, but I don't have the key.
[178:36.44]I will never again meet someone like Zachary.
[178:39.38]I can't bear to think what will happen to all his rare parts now.
[178:42.62]Come on, Zachary.
[178:45.80]It's definitely hidden in a plant.
[178:48.98]Wait, what?
[178:55.65]I don't even need a key.
[178:57.39]Do you guys even care that I'm about to do this?
[179:15.79]I have so many objects that just distract them.
[179:19.25]Hey, look, there's an apricot that like flew over.
[179:21.19]Do you see that?
[179:21.77]Pretty ridiculous, huh?
[179:26.38]Okay, ready?
[180:06.55]I got a boat key.
[180:16.49]Alright, where is- look at this.
[180:18.05]This is poison.
[180:19.93]Poison.
[180:20.77]Repair, distillate, I need a wrench.
[180:26.63]Look at all this shit.
[180:35.90]What's that?
[180:36.76]Poison?
[180:37.82]Emma?
[180:38.66]Hmm... Really?
[180:48.00]Something is circled, 47.
[180:48.95]Female, age 65 to 79.
[180:53.71]60 to 64 kilograms.
[180:55.63]I'd say Madam Carlyle is next in line for a poisoning.
[181:00.35]You have uncovered enough evidence to tell Madam Carlyle that Emma is the murderer.
[181:07.42]Really?
[181:10.28]Jim Carrey.
[181:11.16]I suggest you go tell Mr. Fernsby.
[181:14.40]Unless you think there are more secrets to uncover.
[181:17.24]Really?
[181:23.63]So I can report to Mr. Fernsby.
[181:29.45]Wait, who's this?
[181:34.01]Are these poisons lemonade?
[181:34.97]Just for fun?
[181:41.08]Find secrets.
[181:41.92]Reload, reload, reload, reload, reload.
[181:43.84]Why?
[181:48.70]Reload.
[181:53.49]Why am I going to reload?
[181:54.37]I just solved the mystery.
[181:55.19]You killed four people.
[181:57.06]So?
[181:57.12]Yeah, I killed four people.
[182:21.82]And just because you brought that up, I'm going to kill another.
[182:47.39]I'm ready to present my conclusion to Madam Carlyle.
[182:50.31]Very well.
[182:50.99]If you'll follow me, sir.
[182:56.51]I think he did it too.
[183:05.52]Quick break massage.
[183:07.92]Butler's office?
[183:08.64]Butler's office.
[183:09.30]Butler's office.
[183:11.00]No, no.
[183:11.80]Butler's office.
[183:12.54]Check the Butler's office.
[183:15.66]Check his room.
[183:16.58]You need to go to the butler's.
[183:17.60]How do I get his key?
[183:18.44]Oh wait, I have a crowbar.
[183:32.59]Where's his office?
[183:36.18]Down here?
[183:49.25]Reload.
[183:49.65]Reload.
[183:50.69]Ah.
[183:50.85]Reload.
[183:52.07]Ah.
[183:52.45]Ah.
[184:07.84]Alright.
[184:08.26]Let's check it out.
[184:11.24]I think he did it too.
[184:13.04]I'm going to take the saber in case he comes in with like a sword or something trying to fight me.
[184:16.97]He did it too.
[184:17.81]Of course he did.
[184:18.49]He has like probably poison up right here.
[184:20.27]He's probably got like a gun.
[184:22.67]He's got something going on here.
[184:24.41]Yeah, here's a diary.
[184:25.95]Burnt diary.
[184:28.27]Of course.
[184:28.83]I told you guys this was going to happen.
[184:30.46]He was about to confess to the world that he and Alexa murdered their older brother Montgomery 46 years ago.
[184:36.94]And apparently Mr. Fernsby helped make the murder look like an accident.
[184:41.41]He did, did he?
[184:42.49]And 47, the handwriting doesn't match the suicide letter in his room.
[184:47.35]Interesting.
[184:47.71]Proving he didn't write it himself.
[184:51.45]On Mr. Fernsby's list.
[184:58.03]A list written by Mr. Furnsby, the butler.
[185:00.09]It details various preparations for tomorrow's pretend funeral.
[185:03.59]And a photo shoot scheduled for today by the fountain in the garden.
[185:06.85]The handwriting does not match Carlisle's suicide note.
[185:12.73]Oh my god.
[185:13.63]What's that?
[185:23.51]Mansion Master Key.
[185:27.28]Every door.
[185:27.92]Hmm.
[185:32.22]Interesting.
[185:34.81]Hmm.
[185:37.13]Hmm.
[185:38.01]Uh-oh.
[185:38.99]Hmm.
[185:51.19]Okay, we're supposed to kill Madam Carlisle.
[185:53.15]I feel like we should be... I feel like we should just... You know what I mean?
[185:56.84]We could do that.
[185:57.24]Hmm.
[185:57.34]Hmm.
[185:57.58]Frame the butler.
[185:58.54]I like that idea.
[185:59.28]Let's do it.
[185:59.68]Something else in here to look at?
[186:24.53]Throw away the saber.
[186:25.45]Shit, you're right.
[186:36.52]Use the boat.
[186:37.14]What?
[186:38.56]Don't do that.
[186:40.62]Fuck Emma.
[186:41.90]Fuck over Emma, not the butler.
[186:46.66]What about the boat key?
[186:48.76]What about it?
[186:49.32]I don't know.
[186:49.64]I have to pee really bad.
[186:52.91]Why even bother solving the mystery?
[186:55.11]Yeah, I don't know.
[186:56.27]Does it even matter?
[186:57.09]Is there a note somewhere I can take a picture of?
[187:07.58]What's that?
[187:07.82]It's like a handwritten note.
[187:12.64]There's two out of three clues in here.
[187:13.90]What's the other one?
[187:17.15]Oh, no, I got them all.
[187:24.94]It's just for achievements.
[187:27.03]What about the picture?
[187:29.43]Wait a minute, what's up here?
[187:32.31]Nope.
[187:33.71]Take a pee break.
[187:34.61]I know I have to pee so bad.
[187:38.31]I gotta pee.
[187:38.65]Alright, I'm gonna... What do I do?
[187:40.64]I'm gonna save it and we'll do like two or three different YouTube endings.
[187:42.76]Alright, I gotta pee.
[187:45.20]I'll be right back.
[191:54.84]Whopper watch, was that what that was?
[192:05.71]You're a consumer.
[192:08.65]Yes, so are you.
[192:12.39]You don't always have to be a comedian.
[192:21.04]Clown.

[192:55.28]Hold on.
[193:22.25]When is Otto's pogtastic adventure?
[193:25.49]Well, wouldn't you like to know?
[193:30.11]Interesting.
[193:33.10]It's not like that's going to... You think it's going to be a cell phone video of Otto running around?
[193:42.44]Of what you don't know.
[193:43.60]You have no idea.
[193:45.81]What did I say?
[193:46.27]Four projects?
[193:47.39]Five.
[193:48.45]Five.
[193:49.85]Five projects coming up.
[193:54.05]These cat boys.
[193:55.01]Alright, let's go.
[194:02.67]Let's solve the mystery of... Man Manor.
[194:06.62]Whatever this is.
[194:17.53]I am ready.
[194:21.37]You need to go to the boat.
[194:35.74]No.
[194:37.96]I'll go to the boat after this.
[194:39.36]Look, I'm just gonna throw a brick at her and snap his neck and then I'll go to the boat.
[194:44.40]I'll go to the boat.
[194:45.24]I gotta have to do every single thing.
[194:46.84]It's Hitman.
[194:47.46]It's not collect every achievement, man.
[194:51.69]My goal is to kill this lady.
[195:13.89]Don't kill the butler.
[195:14.93]I will make my decision when I get up there.
[195:17.93]What I feel like doing.
[195:27.61]I might decide to push him out the window.
[195:30.31]I might decide to throw a brick at him.
[195:32.93]I might decide to poison her and then punch him.
[195:36.71]I might decide to leave them both in the room and have them kill each other.
[195:40.66]This is Madam Carlisle's office.
[195:42.72]Please step inside.
[195:44.12]I might just brick him right now.
[195:46.54]You just pointed the wrong way.
[195:47.58]Oh, no, you didn't.
[195:56.39]Your detective skills have gained you access to the lion's den, 47.
[196:01.01]Now, go claim your reward.
[196:03.57]Okay.
[196:04.54]So, Mr. Whitmer, you've reached a conclusion.
[196:07.48]Take a seat.
[196:16.93]Time to get the file on Arthur Edwards.
[196:24.04]What?
[196:31.52]Oh, wait.
[196:34.30]How far away was that save?
[196:39.82]You thought you were so cool.
[196:41.38]Alright, I'm ready.
[196:44.58]Let's go.
[196:45.46]I know where it is.
[196:58.83]Come on, slow.
[196:59.73]You're too slow.
[197:07.44]Hurry up.
[197:08.04]Go.
[197:11.24]I know where her office is.
[197:12.20]Just hurry up.
[197:15.59]Go to the boat, 47.
[197:16.47]47, use the boat.
[197:18.61]47, go to the boat.
[197:19.37]You should use the boat before you do it.
[197:21.65]I just saved over enough to sleep.
[197:25.09]I didn't even mean to do that, but I did.
[197:35.94]God damn it.
[197:36.62]I hope I didn't really need to do the boat or anything.
[197:42.56]Did I just poison the drink?
[197:43.80]Okay, is it illegal to bring soap into a room?
[197:48.85]I'm going to get so many achievements for doing all the detective work stuff.
[197:52.87]I know for a fact that half you guys had played this level.
[197:56.11]You threw a rock at her.
[197:57.97]And then you ended the game.
[197:59.23]And you went to the next mission.
[198:00.47]I know you did.
[198:01.47]So I definitely did more than you did.
[198:10.32]This is Madam Carlisle's office.
[198:11.74]I didn't buy this game.
[198:15.14]Yes, you did.
[198:16.30]Yes, you did.
[198:18.20]Your detective skills have gained you access to the lion's den, 47.
[198:22.82]Now, go claim your reward.
[198:25.83]Here we go.
[198:26.25]So, Mr. Whitmer, you've reached a conclusion.
[198:29.13]I have.
[198:29.69]What is that?
[198:30.01]Wait.
[198:33.91]Who are you?
[198:35.79]Do I know you?
[198:36.81]Can you believe this guy?
[198:39.05]Why do you have a button on your seat?
[198:40.15]Sit down.
[198:40.46]Can we talk please?
[199:02.45]Can we please, please, let the machine come down?
[199:07.05]Get soft, you motherfucker!
[199:10.45]Come here, come here, come here, come here!
[199:18.78]Why does she have a button on her chair?
[199:22.28]Why do you have a button on your chair?
[199:24.74]I have to press it.
[199:27.67]This is a reverse doorbell.
[199:29.13]What?
[199:29.29]I don't understand what that's for.
[199:30.71]Why do you have that?
[199:31.47]She's going to dump me.
[199:32.77]She's going to dump me.
[199:33.73]She's going to dump me.
[199:34.37]I get it.
[199:34.83]She's going to dump me.
[199:35.41]Let's just get dumped.
[199:35.95]Hmm.
[199:36.05]Accused Emma.
[199:36.31]Accused Mr. Furnsby.
[199:36.75]Or accused Zachary.
[200:00.31]I can do the evidence on Mr. Furnsby.
[200:04.29]Let's do Emma because it was definitely Emma.
[200:05.81]Your niece, Emma Carlyle, murdered your brother, Zachary.
[200:09.96]My niece?
[200:11.58]Emma is not my niece.
[200:13.18]She's my daughter-in-law.
[200:15.00]And your niece.
[200:16.60]Emma is the illegitimate child of your late older brother, Montgomery.
[200:20.67]Preposterous.
[200:21.21]Who you and Zachary killed 46 years ago.
[200:25.09]That's preposterous.
[200:26.87]You asked me to find out what happened to Zachary.
[200:30.42]Would you rather not know?
[200:31.73]No.
[200:33.83]No, go on.
[200:34.89]I found a letter from Emmer's mother, Jane, who was the fiancée of your older brother at the time of his death.
[200:42.46]She witnessed how you and Zachary pushed him off the balcony.
[200:47.17]She believed you did it to steal the Carlisle Empire from her.
[200:51.77]Don't let her remove the Diet Coke button.
[200:54.29]And she raised Emma to reclaim what she lost.
[200:57.36]What are you talking about?
[200:58.64]Get revenge and secure the Carlisle Empire for her bloodline generations to come.
[201:06.22]Emma is the daughter of Montgomery and that local girl.
[201:14.14]The girl got it wrong.
[201:15.78]I didn't steal anything.
[201:17.48]I did what was necessary to take the future of the Carlyles.
[201:21.60]Oh, he pressed the Diet Coke button.
[201:24.20]Everybody kill him.
[201:25.22]But I just wanted a Diet Coke.
[201:26.52]Emma used the funeral gathering to speed up her installment as the lady of the house.
[201:32.80]So why don't they just kill me?
[201:34.10]Why are they letting me do this?
[201:36.98]She did her homework.
[201:38.78]Used a poison made from one of Zachary's rare plants.
[201:42.93]I'm gonna get a lot of achievements for this one.
[201:45.21]What do I get?
[201:45.81]Have a Diet Coke.
[201:46.67]Money.
[202:13.87]I can take the case file.
[202:14.67]Give me the case file.
[202:17.94]Oh, you blew it.
[202:19.14]You blew it, lady.
[202:19.70]Hmm.
[202:43.44]You doing a double cross here?
[202:44.68]Oh, it opened the safe.
[202:45.66]I don't want to soap her in the head so bad right now, but it...
[203:14.39]God, I hope you get Edwards and make him hurt.
[203:19.79]I need some privacy.
[203:22.33]Thank you.
[203:25.41]Oh, my God.
[203:26.21]I can just take it?
[203:28.41]I got the case.
[203:31.63]Good work, 47.
[203:32.73]You're just giving this to me.
[203:34.27]That's the file on Arthur Edwards secured.
[203:36.65]Time to take care of Madam Carlyle.
[203:38.92]You're just giving this to me.
[203:41.24]You're giving this to me.
[203:42.92]I'm going to go stand at the balcony.
[203:45.70]Really?
[203:48.97]I'm going to just go stand at the balcony?
[203:59.91]No, no, no.
[204:00.27]Go back and do that.
[204:01.01]Go back and do what you were just doing.
[204:03.01]Go back and do what you were just doing.
[204:07.09]Go back and do what you were just doing.
[204:12.15]Go back and do what you were just doing.
[204:14.33]Close that door.
[204:14.97]Don't open that again.
[204:16.95]Close that door.
[204:17.63]Do not open that door.
[204:19.61]Go back and go to the balcony.
[204:22.71]She's not ready to go in.
[204:23.96]She's not ready.
[204:27.32]What?
[204:27.60]What?
[204:43.61]Why is she still alive?
[204:44.77]Why are you still alive?
[204:46.73]I'm just throwing sugar at her.
[205:05.07]Just various objects.
[205:20.98]This is going to kill her.
[205:23.08]They're just stepping on her.
[205:25.40]Die.
[205:36.63]Too many comedy utensils.
[205:38.01]Yeah.
[205:38.35]Alright.
[205:38.69]Here we go.
[205:39.19]Hey, I'm Miss Carlyle.
[205:40.57]How's the view?
[205:45.44]He's alive.
[205:46.42]Oh.
[205:47.84]Why is it so loud?
[205:49.72]Turn your mic.
[205:50.68]Your mic is peaking.
[205:57.24]Go into windows and turn the gain down.
[206:00.52]Please.
[206:01.20]Someone help me.
[206:02.18]Hey.
[206:02.34]I'm going to get your head out of your ass double quick.
[206:06.55]I need help.
[206:07.59]Something terrible is happening.
[206:09.39]You need help.
[206:09.97]All the best to you.
[206:19.57]I tried.
[206:20.51]I tried.
[206:20.83]I tried.
[206:21.13]I'm sorry guys.
[206:21.87]Like this is too simple.
[206:48.88]Someone's killing people for fun.
[206:50.74]It seems.
[206:52.02]Under a court of law, it might not be.
[206:54.26]It could be though.
[206:55.39]It's possible.
[207:04.51]He's still alive.
[207:14.17]Someone is out here allegedly killing people.
[207:20.69]Hit him.
[207:25.94]Alright, I'm going to dump her and I'm leaving.
[207:27.38]Whatever.
[207:28.12]I'm going to get some good achievements for this one.
[207:36.08]Turn it.
[207:36.64]Go online.
[207:37.16]You won't get the achievements.
[207:40.54]How do I go online?
[207:45.22]No achievements offline.
[207:47.34]Offline, no achievements.
[207:48.46]What?
[207:52.97]No, you're offline.
[207:55.01]Don't.
[207:55.25]Uh-oh, online.
[207:57.63]What are you talking about?
[208:05.26]What if I can just like soap her in the head?
[208:06.62]I can.
[208:08.10]Okay, I can.
[208:09.06]I just soaked.
[208:09.62]I just punched her in the face with soap.
[208:12.29]Wait, if I go online, is it going to wipe my progress?
[208:30.22]It is, isn't it?
[208:30.74]That was a nice bounce.
[208:39.12]That was a nice bounce.
[208:41.35]Just leave and go online.
[208:46.11]I'm scared to do that.
[208:50.83]It will, won't it?
[208:56.24]This is the first time in probably two or three full video games.
[209:00.32]What?
[209:01.06]I'm not supposed to... I'm not supposed to be in here.
[209:05.66]Oh, Jesus.
[209:06.10]How do I get out?
[209:06.48]Wait.
[209:06.70]What is this?

[210:39.44]It's when I can't find the exit within 10 seconds.
[210:41.38]I'd have to throw a brick at somebody.
[210:48.88]Remember, it's not funny.
[210:57.00]I'm not trying to be funny.

[221:18.81]Is this an agent?
[221:19.79]That's an agent!
[221:27.53]Agent Price, an excellent trapper.
[221:29.29]Agent Price prefers to hunt alone.
[221:31.54]A man of nature and solitude.
[221:33.58]This is his first assignment with fellow agents, where communication is his greatest foe.
[221:40.08]Uh, wasn't very good.
[221:49.09]He's walking around.
[221:49.91]Okay.
[221:50.15]Search the compound and locate the agent.
[221:59.38]Wait, they're looking for me.
[222:00.22]Can I drop in and be like, yeah, I heard he's really handsome.
[222:04.48]Family Guy skit.
[222:06.47]No, I did it wrong.
[222:08.07]Yeah, well, I heard he's really handsome.
[222:30.21]Yeah, okay.
[222:30.99]Whatever.
[222:31.43]Family Guy makes like a thousand jokes an episode.
[222:33.31]They've made like 50,000 jokes a day.
[222:35.61]What do you want me to do?
[222:39.63]I gotta sniff out agents?
[222:40.99]Is this like a line to the club?
[222:49.14]Where the hell is this?
[222:53.94]That's definitely an agent right here.
[222:55.88]No way that's not an agent.
[222:57.22]You serious?
[222:58.08]This is an agent.
[222:59.66]Yeah.
[223:00.56]Without a doubt.
[223:00.98]I don't even care if it compromises the mission.
[223:02.28]This is an agent right here.
[223:03.06]I guarantee it.
[223:04.66]I guarantee this is an agent.
[223:11.54]See if I'm right.
[223:15.39]This is definitely like I'm dressed up like this to pretend to be going to this party.
[223:19.01]He's an agent.
[223:22.81]Agent.
[223:24.17]No, he wasn't.
[223:24.75]But whatever.
[223:38.49]It's okay.
[223:44.55]Don't give me a shovel right now.
[223:47.14]Come on.
[223:48.42]Don't give... Don't make me like the Home Alone guy.
[223:50.84]Come on.
[223:52.38]I'm... Alright.

[255:32.41]Alright, light show.
[255:40.20]What does this actually end up doing for me?
[255:46.70]One of these lasers probably can kill somebody with it, right?
[255:49.54]You make it a real laser and it saws through somebody's head.
[255:58.60]Holy shit.
[255:58.84]There's an agent right there.
[256:09.32]Do I get any more info from this?
[256:14.12]Make, cause a mosh pit.
[256:15.40]Can I actually do that?
[256:29.20]If all DJs work in the mixing desk, please talk to one of the technicians first if you want to trigger the climax light show as it's highly unstable and could be very dangerous.
[256:40.61]Wait, what?
[256:42.41]I could probably mess with it up there.
[256:43.49]Hype up light show and then trigger climax, right?

[265:58.61]I gotta get rid of the... I don't have any coins.
[266:02.90]Like a soda can.
[266:10.12]One of them walks away for a second.

[267:44.21]OK, so now this is like super powered.
[267:50.02]Now do the DJ climax.
[267:52.16]Explore... Expose the wire.
[267:54.36]Put the fuse back... Put the fuse back together.
[267:58.86]Fuse box.

[269:13.37]I can't... Give me that earpiece.
[269:22.24]All the setup to just... Wait, I need the DJ off it.
[269:52.32]Okay, so let me get this straight.
[269:55.02]Short circuit the light installation.
[269:57.78]Unplug the wire fuse box.
[270:00.70]Turn off the voltage.
[270:02.18]Which button do I have to press here?
[270:11.83]How stoned are you?
[270:16.63]The outlet was literally behind... Wait, am I supposed to... What is he supposed to step on?
[270:20.22]This?
[270:20.46]This?
[270:22.57]Only short-circuited.
[270:26.79]Just shoot him.
[270:30.64]Just overload it and shoot him.
[270:37.76]Okay.
[270:38.60]Here's the plan.
[270:49.78]Come over here.
[270:55.70]I want this outfit.

[271:11.23]It's Oceans 11.
[271:18.77]Okay, now I'm allowed to short circuit this.
[271:21.13]So the wire, so expose the wire.
[271:27.57]Right?
[271:27.91]And then short-circuited.
[271:33.46]What am I actually supposed to be doing?
[271:34.98]I'm not even kidding.
[271:35.78]What am I supposed to be doing here?
[271:38.70]What is killing them?
[271:40.79]What is supposed to kill this person?
[271:43.97]I have no idea.
[271:50.33]Is it the wire?

[272:15.83]No.
[272:18.79]Oh.
[272:20.87]I thought he was supposed to walk over the exposed wire.
[272:23.27]Oh, okay.
[272:27.04]Well.
[272:29.15]I just have to short circuit this.

[272:46.75]OK, so.
[272:49.31]Let me let me go over this.
[272:50.55]Let me go over this.
[272:53.99]Turn the fuse box off.
[272:55.19]Get the technicians outfit.
[272:58.64]Short circuit this and turn off the voltage.
[273:02.15]What am I supposed to do?
[273:07.43]Don't touch the switch.
[273:10.35]You don't even need the costume.
[273:11.75]But if I do this, isn't it going to... Look, they're going to be pissed about this.
[273:16.24]Watch.

[273:45.46]I'm done after this, by the way.
[273:47.98]I'm done.
[273:49.32]I'm done with Hitman 3 for now.

[278:22.64]My brain is too fried right now to even attempt to play this game anymore.
[278:26.36]I'm just going to save it somewhere.
[278:38.05]Alright, can I please just like stand in a corner where nobody can see me?
[278:44.41]Just like let me be.
[278:45.25]Everybody can see through your disguise in this level.

[278:51.68]Alright, we're going over here.

[279:26.53]Slamming his desk.
[279:27.63]No, I'll probably call it here though.
[279:29.21]How do you like eat something?
[279:41.41]But anyways, this has been Hitman 3.
[279:45.17]I think it's been pretty fun.
[279:46.77]Except for this level.
[279:47.91]I don't like this level at all.
[279:52.35]I don't like it.
[279:54.87]But I'm going to continue playing it.
[279:58.57]I will.
[280:00.59]There's some stuff to do over the next four days or so.
[280:05.06]So I'm going to come back to you guys on Sunday night.
[280:08.66]Don't fucking look at me.
[280:09.78]I hate this level.
[280:13.46]Okay.
[280:15.02]I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[280:16.96]We've got a lot to talk about.
[280:20.37]There are a lot of projects that you'll see.
[280:22.07]A couple that will be very soon.
[280:24.23]It's not going to come back until Monday?
[280:28.11]No, I'm streaming Sunday night.
[280:29.87]Not on Wednesday.
[280:32.11]There are five major streams that you will see before like quarter one, quarter two is up.
[280:42.35]They're going to be very, very big.
[280:43.45]I hope they're fun.
[280:46.69]Two of them you'll see in the next probably 30 days.
[280:50.17]I'm looking forward to it.
[280:53.16]Actual cereal.
[280:54.18]Please don't get high.
[280:55.10]Okay, let me be real.
[280:56.44]I'm not high at all.
[280:58.24]I think I just got like a wave of tiredness.
[281:01.04]That just exploded.
[281:01.90]I have not... I swear to God, not had a single ounce, a single taste of marijuana today.
[281:09.25]I swear to God, I promise.
[281:11.98]Something waved over me in the last like 30 minutes.
[281:15.55]I have no idea what it was.
[281:20.88]Today.
[281:21.44]No, stop it.
[281:23.60]Three whole marijuanas.
[281:29.66]Ah.
[281:30.32]No, it was fun.
[281:31.71]Hitman's always fun.
[281:33.31]Something about this level, though, I don't know what happened in the last 30 minutes.
[281:35.67]I just can't even pay attention.
[281:37.51]I just hate fucking cement.
[281:38.89]If you have cement levels in your game, delete them.
[281:41.11]Everybody hates them.
[281:42.10]Including me.
[281:42.82]I hate it.
[281:43.92]I hate when everything's a cement level.
[281:45.30]Just get rid of it.
[281:46.28]Last one was so good.
[281:47.10]The one before that was... I hate the cement.
[281:48.56]Here's a dance club.
[281:49.26]Get rid of the cement.
[281:50.30]Delete the cement from the fucking game.
[281:51.99]I hate the cement.
[281:52.89]I hate parking garages.
[281:54.17]Get rid of them.
[281:54.55]I lose my car in a parking garage.
[281:56.23]I can't park in a parking garage because every slot is the same.
[282:00.69]Anyways.
[282:07.14]It's brutal.
[282:10.18]Nah, I'm just kidding.
[282:12.40]I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[282:14.42]Thanks for watching.
[282:15.88]We might not go back to this on Sunday.
[282:22.84]Maybe we will.
[282:25.01]There might be something else I want to do.
[282:32.71]There's a few things on the list.
[282:35.53]When is the Catboy stream?
[282:38.32]Within the next six months.
[282:40.06]There you go.
[282:44.04]Game of the year, by the way.
[282:50.54]I will give my assessment on Hitman 3 when I finish it.
[282:56.67]That's what you will get.
[282:59.89]I'm only three missions in.
[283:07.11]You're never going to finish it.
[283:07.79]I finished the first two.
[283:08.50]What are you talking about?
[283:09.40]I did all the DLC for the first two as well.
[283:18.16]Oh, Otto.
[283:18.86]Hold on.
[283:20.18]Otto, go ahead.
[283:27.31]Oh, shit, my hand.
[283:29.49]I don't want it to run away.
[283:33.17]Thanks, as always, for watching, though.
[283:36.78]Sorry I couldn't figure out how to get out of a parking garage for the last 30 minutes.
[283:39.30]Oh, well.
[283:42.52]I tried.
[283:44.81]Show Bionicle.
[283:45.61]We're actually reaching out to Bionicle.
[283:50.57]If you missed the beginning of the stream, Twitch will not allow me to stream the Bionicle movie unless I have expressed permission to do so.
[284:00.38]It's not allowed.
[284:02.20]We're going to try to make that happen.
[284:06.10]Actual reaching out to see if we can do that.
[284:13.07]We'll find out.
[284:15.64]Which one?
[284:16.12]The Mask of Light.
[284:21.22]Alright, I'm going to say the second part of that.
[284:37.03]You got a raid.
[284:37.93]There actually was a big raid from Neanderthal today.
[284:41.84]You stuck around from that, thank you.
[284:43.34]Hi.
[284:43.52]Hi.
[284:47.13]I'm really, you know, I'm really looking forward to the archaeologist stream.
[284:51.36]Like a lot of you guys are gonna dig that a lot.
[284:52.84]It's gonna be really fun.
[285:02.92]That wasn't, no, I meant that for real.
[285:08.42]I gotta go eat like peanut butter or like hamburger meat or something.
[285:11.79]I don't know, my brain is like shutting itself down.
[285:23.59]I have a bad hamburger brain right now.
[285:30.97]Raid?
[285:31.29]Who should we raid?
[285:32.17]Where are we going?
[285:32.61]Who's alive right now?
[285:36.31]Let's see.
[285:45.10]We could go...
[285:51.44]Oh, Vinny's playing Metroid.
[285:53.54]Yeah, let's go say hello to Vinny.
[285:54.80]It's been a while.
[285:58.16]Super Metroid.
[285:59.29]Cool stuff.
[286:00.93]I've never played Super Metroid before.
[286:02.29]I was ahead of Vinny.
[286:09.19]He's a great guy.
[286:10.47]Great company.
[286:12.63]And I'll see you guys on Sunday night.
[286:14.11]I'm not streaming until Sunday night.
[286:18.61]I'll play something fun.
[286:19.70]We'll do something interesting.
[286:22.22]If it's not Hitman, we'll do something else.
[286:25.38]Sunday PST somewhere around.
[286:27.81]We're going to be late one.
[286:29.09]It's going to be a late stream, late night stream on Sunday.
[286:33.09]And then I will be back to my regularly scheduled sort of streams.
[286:38.93]You've seen like one stream a week the last two weeks.
[286:42.02]I've been pretty busy.
[286:42.58]A lot going on.
[286:46.52]Hopefully you will see the fruits of that labor in the next month or two.
[286:51.08]I know you will.
[286:53.43]So probably not until like 7 or 8 o'clock p.m.
[286:57.03]on Sunday.
[286:57.45]We're doing late night Pacific Stream.
[287:02.03]Late night Andy.
[287:05.58]But as always, thanks for watching.
[287:07.86]Sorry for being like an absolute moron the last 20 minutes.
[287:14.16]I have like no explanation for that because I wish I could tell you I was high.
[287:17.10]But I just...
[287:18.46]I kind of leaned into that.
[287:19.42]Oh, man.
[287:20.72]I really kicked in 20 minutes ago.
[287:22.99]No, no, no.
[287:24.29]I have no idea why I was just so tired.
[287:27.21]It just hit me like a brick.
[287:29.93]Sorry.
[287:30.89]I'm sorry.
[287:32.68]I'll see you Sunday night, though, guys.
[287:33.92]Take care of yourselves.
[287:34.74]We'll see you soon.
[287:35.96]Good night.
[287:36.32]Oh, fuck.
[287:36.74]You can leave now.
