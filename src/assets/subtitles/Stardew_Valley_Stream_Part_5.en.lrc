[00:31.17]Alright.
[00:33.65]Let's get in a relaxing position.
[00:36.81]We're relaxing.
[00:42.24]Cliffhanger, if you just joined us, I did not go through with the deal with the devil.
[00:53.40]We are working for the little man.
[00:56.24]No corporate bullshit.
[01:04.40]And hopefully my Twitch alerts is fixed.
[01:11.79]See, I'll prove it.
[01:12.33]Look, ready?
[01:16.57]See?
[01:16.87]Membership is now available.
[01:17.89]I didn't go through with it.
[01:22.83]No!
[01:31.31]Let me just tweet this out.
[01:32.37]I do apologize, by the way, in advance.
[01:37.32]I'm kind of coming down with a little throat issue, throat bug, if you will.
[01:42.79]So if I make a couple of grunting noises or if I sound a little odd somewhere in the stream, I apologize.
[01:50.71]It's not quite at the level of, you know, gross.
[01:54.08]I can feel it.
[01:54.68]I'm getting sick.
[01:56.70]It's been a while since I've been really flu or cold sick, though.
[02:00.36]It's been like six months or almost a year.
[02:02.44]Okay, I just wanted to tweet it.
[02:08.93]Just wanted to tweet it.
[02:13.11]Before I saved it, I had to... I didn't give the ancient seed yet.
[02:17.09]So I'm going to do that.
[02:20.37]Pick up a berry on the ground, you know.
[02:22.47]Plenty of berries.
[02:24.43]And let's do a little bit of slouching.
[02:27.01]That's better.
[02:27.49]That's much better.
[02:33.90]Leaning back in the chair.
[02:43.10]What was I doing?
[02:45.57]Oh, yeah.
[02:50.72]What is this?
[02:51.14]Is there like... Close until summer?
[02:54.56]Then why do you have a pumpkin here?
[02:55.58]I feel like the pumpkin shouldn't be there.
[02:57.46]You're misleading me.
[02:58.16]I think, yeah, there's something I can buy here.
[02:59.70]That's fall related.
[03:05.87]I did this last time, but I have to do it again because I did not save the game.
[03:08.75]Let's give you my recipe.
[03:17.17]Ayoye.
[03:21.42]And I was going to go to the mine.
[03:24.18]Because I need coal.
[03:25.78]I need a lot of things.
[03:28.20]I need gold.
[03:28.82]I need coal.
[03:29.54]I need to upgrade my pickaxe.
[03:33.19]Which is the next thing on the table.
[03:34.61]Upgrade pickaxe.
[03:36.43]Get gold.
[03:38.43]Prepare for the winter.
[03:41.11]And then year one is... Done, right?
[03:45.73]After winter?
[03:46.13]I'm not sure if I'll get all the way through year one.
[03:49.78]But I'm almost there.
[03:57.61]Hey, Hetaro.
[03:58.91]How are you?
[03:59.75]Welcome.
[04:08.00]What's going on, dude?
[04:11.08]What's going on, Adolfo?
[04:21.81]Twitch notifications are dead?
[04:23.11]What do you mean?
[04:23.77]It just doesn't tell when I'm live or something?
[04:31.62]Okay.
[04:32.32]We need a bunch of coal.
[04:34.80]And I'm going for just a bunch of resources here.
[04:37.12]I want to remove these because that's going to be annoying switching between them.
[04:48.07]Is it a ghost?
[04:49.17]Is it ghosts now?
[04:54.11]Ah, the French champagne.
[04:57.84]It's always been celebrated for its excellence.
[05:00.78]Hey, Inky the Blot, they work.
[05:02.58]It's back to normal.
[05:03.40]Thanks for resubbing three months.
[05:06.48]It's a long time.
[05:11.84]We get to hear Orson Welles again.
[05:13.80]It's been too long, Orson.
[05:14.80]It's been like 12 hours.
[05:15.90]I haven't heard your voice.
[05:16.70]I need it.
[05:22.48]There it is.
[05:24.46]But we need resources.
[05:28.79]Don't I have a quest to kill slimes too, if I remember?
[05:30.79]I don't even know.
[05:31.71]I might.
[05:38.31]Oh my god, let me get a snack first.
[05:40.75]There's plenty of time.
[05:42.77]I'm gonna be streaming this for a while.
[05:46.29]I don't think I'm gonna be playing Overwatch tonight.
[05:51.23]I think this is just gonna be a strictly snow stream, you know what I mean?
[05:56.39]Trying to survive the winter.
[06:01.69]Nothing else.
[06:05.57]2.10 p.m.
[06:06.13]Yeah, back to bed.
[06:08.95]Does coal drop a lot from... snow area?
[06:13.98]Not really.
[06:18.10]I need to break more rocks.
[06:20.94]Play Overwatch.
[06:21.60]What is this?
[06:21.92]Is this a secret path?
[06:26.27]What?
[06:26.75]Oh, look at that.
[06:27.91]I can go in there.
[06:30.51]The path goes in there.
[06:35.97]Do I have to blow it up or something?
[06:37.65]That's weird.
[06:38.23]Oh well.
[06:48.26]I like how I'm getting the ladders very quickly.
[06:52.16]They usually take a long ass time.
[07:03.39]Those holes are lies.
[07:04.47]Yeah, I mean, I see these ones, but that one in particular is very large.
[07:23.75]I did get more max energy from the starfruit, or this teardrop, whatever the hell it was.
[07:33.42]Any little bit will help.
[07:41.23]I need more coal.
[07:45.99]What the hell is that?
[07:49.23]Oh, there, you answered my prayers.
[07:51.43]Thanks, coal bag.
[08:08.99]Welcome to the 19-inch chub club.
[08:11.01]We're still doing that?
[08:11.81]We're still on that joke?
[08:14.46]This is a new area.
[08:16.14]Big.
[08:26.16]Some quartz.
[08:28.44]I need this.
[08:29.95]The whole point here, guys.
[08:32.19]Year two is going to be our year.
[08:37.65]I'm gonna stock up on quartz.
[08:39.01]I'm gonna stock up on gold bars.
[08:40.55]We're gonna make sprinklers.
[08:42.99]I'm gonna plant my ancient seed, whatever the hell it is.
[08:46.59]We're gonna have a good year.
[08:50.29]Year two is gonna be the year.
[08:53.27]Now that I know what things do in this game after spending almost a whole year wasting time.
[09:00.12]Although, did I waste that much time?
[09:03.36]I did end up with like $40,000.
[09:12.02]A bomb?
[09:17.84]Oh my goodness.
[09:19.74]This is like a Bomberman bomb.
[09:21.86]That's not a cherry bomb.
[09:26.58]There's another one.
[09:30.40]What is that?
[09:32.38]Oh, that's just poison.
[09:38.31]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[09:43.83]Chase SP1.
[09:47.00]Welcome!
[09:47.42]Thank you for subbing.
[09:52.48]You have my deepest, deepest gratitude.
[09:56.12]Enjoy your eventual solar system.
[10:00.23]Which... I was gonna work on that today.
[10:03.63]Or tonight.
[10:04.05]I was gonna make a couple more planets.
[10:10.84]I can't believe I'm actually doing that, by the way.
[10:20.42]These bat wings will sell for a lot, if I remember correctly.
[10:23.00]Let's just go.
[10:24.32]I don't need to be down here anymore.
[10:27.84]Oh, God.
[10:31.23]Oh, God.
[10:32.81]This is so many enemies.
[10:34.61]There's too many people down here.
[10:35.85]I don't want to die down the well.
[10:44.03]Geez.
[10:47.83]I hate these little dust mites.
[10:48.87]They're the worst.
[10:51.35]They're too erratic.
[10:52.07]Do I have any more food?
[11:02.33]Eat this.
[11:02.67]I'm gonna have to go down here and spam.
[11:08.99]That's a fishing pole!
[11:14.29]Why did I have that selected?
[11:22.99]Frozen Tear.
[11:34.83]I'm taking a lot of unnecessary hits.
[11:38.67]But truth be told, this is the most enemies I think I've seen in the game so far in one room.
[11:42.93]Whoa!
[11:45.01]Dwarf scroll two.
[11:45.89]I already got dwarf scroll three.
[11:48.83]That's a worse version of the spell that I already have.
[11:57.83]That one looks different.
[11:59.48]Is it gonna explode?
[12:00.02]You know what I mean?
[12:03.88]Look, he's doing the thing that all enemies do right before they blow up.
[12:16.32]I think the speed is cool.
[12:22.55]Let me see what it looks like.
[12:23.99]This is a stab.
[12:27.35]This is a...
[12:46.81]Can I say +2 speed?
[12:47.95]Is that actually making me faster?
[12:50.31]I can't even tell.
[12:56.09]Maybe I'll... I need to change your pace.
[12:57.70]It's going to do less damage, but I like the arc.
[13:04.72]Less room for error, especially against these enemies.
[13:09.26]The fuzzy balls.
[13:10.03]Oh, it means +2 swing speed.
[13:15.79]Okay.
[13:19.23]I still don't think that's even... No, that's not even worth it then.
[13:22.99]Plus one defense?
[13:23.97]No.
[13:24.27]Who cares?
[13:24.87]The Trident's the best.
[13:32.78]I gotta go.
[13:33.38]What level am I at right now?
[13:36.30]55?
[13:36.34]Well, I got to 55.
[13:39.56]Yeah, I gotta go.
[13:49.31]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[13:56.88]I'm not sure if that's a snake that accidentally has K's instead of H's.
[14:07.50]But thanks for the resub.
[14:11.50]Welcome back.
[14:18.71]Oh, the French Champagne.
[14:22.41]Has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[14:24.93]I'm going to have to replace that with the Paul Masson speech that he goes off on.
[14:33.49]There is a California Champagne by Paul Masson.
[14:39.45]Level 8 Farming.
[14:42.35]Keg?
[14:43.57]Oil Maker.
[14:44.73]Deluxe Speed Grow.
[14:46.05]Ooh.
[14:49.41]Ooh, Warrior's Ring.
[14:51.57]Is it just what was left over in the box?
[14:59.22]I guess.
[15:02.57]What happens if you pass out in your house?
[15:04.78]Uh, nothing.
[15:05.36]You just end up with half of your energy doesn't go up all the way.
[15:08.74]But at least you don't get robbed.
[15:10.90]That happened to me.
[15:11.54]Did that happen to me?
[15:14.36]I passed out like here or something, right?
[15:16.20]Where did I fall asleep accidentally that one time?
[15:19.12]But it didn't really do anything to me.
[15:24.92]No, I don't even have pumpkins.
[15:29.40]Let's just trash some of this garbage.
[15:35.20]Monster loot a lot of bat wings Just see what I'm gonna see what one of these is worth Hold on to the quartz
[15:58.35]Oh wow, it's all organized now.
[15:59.53]I miss the gravel zeep.
[16:00.72]It's not really or I It's more organized than it was Ashley It's still kind of terrible.
[16:10.32]It's still really terrible Because I didn't know that sprinklers were a thing that you could really do until I got the upgraded ones and
[16:21.62]Sort of went a little overboard with the grapes, but we're not going to talk about that.
[16:25.83]I told you, winter time is going to be good.
[16:30.41]This is all going to be cleared out and we're going to get it on track.
[16:33.95]I'm going to buy like... Look at my money.
[16:36.53]I'm rolling the dough.
[16:43.62]Winter is going to be the turnaround.
[16:45.00]We're going to do smart placement.
[16:51.53]Get a better watering can.
[16:55.56]Better pickaxe.
[16:57.12]New building.
[17:00.46]Organize the house.
[17:06.52]Why do I only have one?
[17:07.35]That was a test.
[17:08.55]I was testing that.
[17:12.85]And it's just kind of still there.
[17:29.07]How long were these in here for?
[17:29.97]I don't actually remember.
[17:32.05]There should be another harvest from these... shortly.
[17:37.94]At least I hope so.
[17:39.40]Only got 10 days left in fall.
[17:55.34]This game has dynamic weather.
[17:58.08]Yeah, it's... I don't know if it's dynamic.
[18:01.24]It goes by the seasons.
[18:03.10]Sometimes it rains and there's thunder and lightning.
[18:07.46]Besides that, not a whole lot of variables.
[18:19.64]Definitely don't have enough water.
[18:27.78]Get rid of the meteorite with the bomb?
[18:30.10]No.
[18:31.14]You saw what happened to that.
[18:32.50]You saw what happened the last time I did that.
[18:35.70]That was a disaster.
[18:43.77]Alright.
[18:45.93]Actually sounds like it's going to rain.
[18:47.13]I kind of just don't care about the corn anymore.
[18:57.28]I think I'm gonna just mow this all down.
[19:00.46]Turn it into a baseball field.
[19:07.59]If I'm gonna get a pickaxe anyways.
[19:12.01]A steel one.
[19:15.60]Although I don't even know if the steel pickaxe can get rid of that.
[19:17.96]I have absolutely no idea.
[19:21.66]It probably doesn't.
[19:32.08]Finally, we're done.
[19:37.16]Spa time.
[19:38.38]And then we're gonna go back to the mine.
[19:42.26]First, I'm gonna put some of this crap away.
[19:50.52]I can donate something.
[19:52.30]Stash this junk.
[20:12.15]Lots of coal.
[20:12.73]I need a little bit more, I think.
[20:13.68]I can sell that sword.
[20:21.28]Anything else I can sell?
[20:22.12]These maple seeds.
[20:25.72]Just useless.
[20:26.54]Let's get rid of the useless garbage.
[20:30.42]I wish I could say that was a crab pot I was going to throw away, but you know.
[20:35.00]No Field of Dreams reference?
[20:39.02]Ronnie, I just used two bombs on the meteorite.
[20:41.30]It did not work.
[20:43.88]That is good to know because I actually may have just gotten enough people to convince me to try it, so.
[20:50.56]Okay.
[20:54.27]I only have 15 copper.
[20:56.41]That seems like none.
[20:58.07]Seems like very, barely any at all.
[21:02.57]Let's go.
[21:12.47]Don't worry, I'll get him.
[21:13.13]I'll get him.
[21:13.47]I'll take care of him.
[21:14.09]Everybody calm down.
[21:14.79]That's a great name.
[21:16.45]Copyright TM.
[21:16.71]Copyright TM.
[21:16.97]Trademarked.
[21:17.25]Thanks for something.
[21:18.79]I like that name a lot.
[21:41.66]Especially because it's copyright RIT.
[21:55.73]How's he doing?
[21:56.25]Is he in here?
[21:57.23]No.
[21:58.99]He's probably at the spa.
[22:09.00]Still haven't figured out what the hell these are.
[22:10.28]These are teleporters, right?
[22:11.20]Somebody was saying.
[22:17.00]Do I have enough energy to go in here?
[22:24.28]Yeah, we're skipping this bar.
[22:37.03]I just need a little bit more coal.
[22:43.67]Now this thing doesn't work.
[22:47.21]That's okay.
[22:54.85]I might actually find things to eat down here.
[23:09.40]Any ore.
[23:11.04]Don't really care about anything else at the moment.
[23:22.00]No, go.
[23:25.09]Did I become Walmart?
[23:26.05]I did not.
[23:27.13]I reverted that decision.
[23:29.05]I'm not Walmart.
[23:33.97]I did it as a... I did it as a way to make the audience gasp.
[23:40.31]And it worked.
[23:42.19]A lot of people gasped when I did that.
[23:47.46]Oh, shit.
[23:48.18]It's a quartz.
[24:01.28]Already the ladder.
[24:02.18]Might be able to get the 60.
[24:02.86]Where do you start finding the other... weapons that are better?
[24:17.00]I so desperately just want to be able to say to myself, wow, that's a direct upgrade.
[24:20.48]I can't wait to put that on.
[24:22.04]But it has not happened yet.
[24:23.00]I'm going to have a lot of iron, which is good.
[24:46.31]They make a very depressing noise when you kill them.
[24:49.69]That is a very sad dying noise.
[24:53.63]It's not even ow.
[24:54.99]It's like, aww, you did it.
[24:57.29]Yeah, these guys give coal.
[25:04.37]Good.
[25:06.18]Little tar.
[25:07.60]Pieces of tar.
[25:14.82]Lot of quartz in here.
[25:23.15]Adventures of a year one duck band.
[25:27.67]What happens in year two?
[25:29.11]Can I change clothes?
[25:30.35]Do I ever get an opportunity to put a different shirt on?
[25:33.21]Or am I always Charlie Brown curious George man?
[25:46.14]What time is it in Jermalin?
[25:47.32]The crunchiest place?
[25:48.60]Why is it the crunchiest place?
[25:51.25]Crunchy.
[25:54.59]Right now it is almost 11 o'clock.
[26:00.10]You know, over here in the crunchiest place on Earth.
[26:03.56]Look, it's doing it again!
[26:08.76]I always wish that was real.
[26:10.18]Little secret area with the cow dung in it or something.
[26:13.94]Dinosaur feces.
[26:16.16]Could sell that for a lot.
[26:26.38]Really?
[26:26.62]I hit you two times.
[26:32.90]Dwarf scroll three.
[26:36.20]What can I do with these now?
[26:40.49]Can I donate more than one?
[26:41.63]Didn't I already donate one?
[26:43.49]Will he accept more than one of those?
[26:50.22]Bag.
[26:51.66]Coal pack.
[26:53.84]Come on.
[26:54.82]Coal pack.
[26:55.52]Nice.
[27:03.93]I gotta remember what that rock looked like.
[27:05.09]That just gave me a jade.
[27:10.25]I would like to have seen Dwarf Scroll 2, or no, 1.
[27:12.74]Any staircase yet?
[27:23.64]Shit.
[27:32.61]Ah, wasting energy.
[27:33.51]Wasting energy.
[27:40.76]What a waste.
[27:45.19]I don't want to have to go back up.
[27:47.55]Because, thank God.
[27:57.55]Okay.
[28:00.05]You just teleported back across the map.
[28:04.16]I'm sorry.
[28:04.68]I didn't mean to kill you.
[28:06.72]But you were in my goddamn way.
[28:17.51]Thankfully, I don't have to build one of those things.
[28:22.93]Alright, do I have anything to eat?
[28:24.15]Nice, I got a good... Ooh, ghost fish!
[28:28.86]Two of them.
[28:29.82]Thank you very much, I will eat one.
[28:37.29]You know what?
[28:37.59]I'm gonna eat two.
[28:46.27]It is 9pm, you're right.
[28:49.09]11 o'clock is my curfew.
[28:57.01]Actually, midnight.
[28:58.37]Midnight's the real curfew.
[28:59.51]That's the one where you're gonna get scared.
[29:00.95]Otherwise, you're probably gonna die.
[29:05.19]Oh, my goodness!
[29:05.85]Diamonds!
[29:07.41]Diamonds!
[29:09.58]Diamond!
[29:12.78]Sick, two diamonds.
[29:21.37]I can donate one of those aquamarines.
[29:26.91]And I made it to 60.
[29:30.23]Wow, there's a... This is really... This is a spiral.
[29:33.43]This is really odd.
[29:37.81]I gotta get all the way to the middle.
[29:39.37]It's really important.
[29:41.45]Hopefully I can get there with energy.
[29:44.40]There's a ton of stuff in the middle.
[29:47.04]It's a giant treasure map.
[29:54.09]Don't run out of energy.
[29:55.31]This is really important.
[29:59.92]Want any more fish?
[30:09.90]Damn it.
[30:11.00]I still can't get by this?
[30:12.94]What the?
[30:16.58]Getting close to needing to immediately regret why I came all the way in here.
[30:23.07]Hold on a second.
[30:24.17]Don't, I don't have it.
[30:25.01]I was gonna say I'll drop a bomb in here.
[30:40.19]Ooh!
[30:41.07]Thermal boots!
[30:46.56]And a perfect way down.
[30:48.70]I'm gonna run out of energy right now.
[30:50.48]And then, alright.
[30:51.88]That was a pretty good run.
[30:55.59]And we get a chest.
[30:57.31]Right when it's time for bed.
[30:59.87]Crystal Dagger.
[31:04.69]And I can fish down here too.
[31:06.99]Come on.
[31:08.11]Be better.
[31:08.95]Be better than the Broken Trident.
[31:11.21]15 to 26.
[31:19.21]No, it's not.
[31:19.92]I mean, plus 50 crit power?
[31:27.57]One defense, two immunity.
[31:30.45]Two defense, one immunity.
[31:31.77]I mean, what's more important, immunity or defense?
[31:42.56]The plus 50 crit power, does that mean 50% more crit damage?
[31:46.76]Or does that mean... What does that... How much damage will I do on a crit?
[31:51.81]Plus five weight.
[31:53.49]What does weight mean?
[31:57.06]Just stab.
[31:57.64]Actually, I want to do one fish one time.
[32:19.46]I have enough for one fish.
[32:28.20]Waits more knockback.
[32:30.08]Don't really care.
[32:30.66]I just want damage.
[32:31.28]I just want to kill them faster.
[32:34.27]Blue color is better than brown color.
[32:35.53]Different item rarities.
[32:39.81]I gotta go.
[32:40.81]I can't fuck around anymore here.
[32:44.05]I'm about to pass out.
[32:47.13]I missed my curfew.
[33:02.22]I'm gonna make it.
[33:02.64]I'll be fine.
[33:07.87]R.I.P.
[33:08.41]Jerry.
[33:09.69]No, I'm gonna be fine.
[33:15.19]I'm gonna be fine.
[33:16.31]Get out of the way!
[33:32.39]I made it.
[33:37.83]These bat wings give so much money.
[33:39.79]40 gold.
[33:43.45]Sell the damn things.
[33:48.92]I need some WD-40.
[33:52.42]You hear this chair?
[33:54.38]Sound like an old man in a rocker.
[33:57.70]Well, it's one of those days.
[34:02.82]Rainin' tomorrow.
[34:05.72]Yeah, my knees been actin' up.
[34:09.06]That's how I know.
[34:09.92]Here we go.
[34:25.33]That means a big cranberry harvest is comin'.
[34:30.79]I've got to get my head on straight here.
[34:32.39]Hold on.
[34:40.30]I have a lot of things to get rid of.
[34:43.52]First of all, 35 coal.
[34:53.06]Two gold quartz.
[34:54.95]Dang.
[34:57.31]Alright, we have this.
[35:04.17]All this is junk.
[35:05.09]Except for this is... Okay.
[35:06.73]Let's go this way.
[35:12.07]Only four hours of sleep.
[35:13.09]Yeah, I know.
[35:25.73]Today will be a spa day.
[35:27.05]Ooh, wait.
[35:27.47]Hold on.
[35:27.75]We got a lot of grapes.
[35:33.93]Lots of grapes!
[35:47.06]Today what we're going to do is we're going to forgo everything else besides the cranberries.
[35:57.17]Because that has got a big kick on these.
[35:59.01]I'm going to do all the left side.
[36:00.17]We're going to do all over here.
[36:01.23]We're not going to water the ones on the right at the moment.
[36:04.21]Don't really have the time, patience, or energy to do that at the moment.
[36:15.50]Give me these stones.
[36:16.86]I still have these.
[36:17.62]Okay.
[36:26.02]One, two...
[36:29.16]Was there some conclusion?
[36:30.58]Is immunity more important than defense?
[36:32.24]Or is defense more important than immunity?
[36:33.76]Because these are the same item quality.
[36:43.28]These are the same item quality too.
[36:45.30]Because if not, I'm just going to go and craft them down and sell them at the Adventurer's Guild.
[37:01.77]Stone fence I still have.
[37:02.97]What the hell do I need this battery pack for?
[37:08.83]They're both pretty crap.
[37:14.58]Well, let's go break down some shit at the Adventurer's Guild.
[37:22.08]But first I'm gonna do some watering.
[37:29.28]Because I'll get a huge surplus of cranberries tomorrow.
[37:32.36]I'm going to have like $60,000.
[37:33.24]I'm being a real Scrooge McDuck.
[37:37.48]I need to spend this money.
[37:40.79]But I'm too focused on preparing for winter.
[37:44.41]And making sure I have what I need for the spring.
[37:48.89]People are saying immunity is better.
[37:53.14]But what is the difference?
[37:54.32]Is immunity like poison or something?
[37:55.68]I don't understand.
[37:56.40]Why wouldn't straight up defense be better?
[38:10.47]Upgrade my house.
[38:14.23]Yeah, I'll be doing a lot of winter adjustments I had to put on the tundra boots because they're blue
[38:32.58]Is this like Fashion Valley?
[38:34.82]Does it matter?
[38:35.34]Is it like Bloodborne?
[38:37.50]Is gear not really that much of an important thing?
[38:39.26]You just kind of want to look cool?
[38:48.87]These keep... Okay, I'm going to go by what they actually say.
[38:53.52]The fuzzy lining keeps your ankles really warm or designed with extreme weather in mind.
[39:11.43]I've had these other ones on for a long time.
[39:15.21]Why can't they be yellow?
[39:19.41]Those are snazzy.
[39:21.89]Okay, these are like blue tap dancing shoes.
[39:28.33]Alright, yeah.
[39:29.17]We're going with these.
[39:38.57]So I got a lot to craft down.
[39:41.59]So that's what we're gonna do.
[39:42.39]We're gonna go sell some things.
[39:51.90]Nice moon shoes.
[39:52.78]Yeah, these are pretty nice moon shoes.
[39:54.20]I do agree.
[39:54.72]Yeah, they are not bad.
[39:58.94]Not bad.
[39:59.36]Pretty good.
[40:00.64]Pretty good.
[40:02.08]Good.
[40:02.62]Good.
[40:03.10]Good.
[40:10.46]Does he sell these things?
[40:11.84]No.
[40:13.72]Just curious.
[40:14.38]Speed grow.
[40:15.28]No.
[40:17.16]What did I get?
[40:17.64]It was the new soil.
[40:18.96]This stuff, right?
[40:20.30]Deluxe speed grow or speed... Deluxe speed grow.
[40:22.72]Increase growth rate by 25% mix into tilled soil.
[40:30.89]Eh.
[40:32.73]Whatever.
[40:36.42]Say blue baby boots three times fast.
[40:38.20]Blue baby boots, blue baby boots, blue baby boots, blue baby boots, blue baby boots, blue baby boots, blue baby boots, did it way more than that.
[40:43.43]That was like six.
[40:48.73]Alright, nobody can see me.
[40:50.87]I could be a trash man.
[40:52.51]He won't even see.
[40:54.38]No, no chocolate.
[40:55.48]Where are the chocolate cakes?
[41:11.64]I have some things for you.
[41:17.76]A dwarf scroll.
[41:21.79]Where's the other dwarf scroll?
[41:22.87]Over here.
[41:24.41]New reward.
[41:25.73]Really?
[41:26.19]What is it?
[41:27.47]What is it, Gunter?
[41:33.05]My house is such an ugly piece of crap.
[41:34.73]These photos just don't work.
[41:35.85]My feng shui is awful.
[41:38.97]Not happy with it.
[41:45.57]Does he... I want... Doesn't he usually have, uh... I thought... Doesn't he have weapons?
[41:58.95]I thought he usually had weapons.
[42:04.15]Okay, well.
[42:04.73]What are you doing in here, Grandpa?
[42:08.97]Taxes?
[42:09.29]You're here to collect his taxes?
[42:18.36]It gets windy this time of year.
[42:19.84]Marvelous!
[42:23.24]Alright, sell these things.
[42:27.40]Up at the... Where is that place?
[42:31.54]Oh, it's all the way up there by the mine.
[42:34.37]Well, I need energy.
[42:37.21]I'm almost going.
[42:38.01]You know what?
[42:38.45]I'm just going to buy... Let's buy some Jolt Cola.
[42:46.21]J-Cola Light?
[42:53.55]Is it cheaper to buy stuff from in here?
[42:56.39]How much is Coke?
[43:03.46]Got plenty of money, don't worry.
[43:10.01]I'm just gonna slam, we're gonna slam two liters of Coke right now.
[43:13.59]Yeah.
[43:53.06]Alright, let's go.
[44:17.15]You guys are like, oh shit.
[44:27.05]Okay, where am I going?
[44:28.78]Oh, up here.
[44:35.54]I was taking like little tiny sips of my drink.
[44:38.94]Or was I?
[44:43.30]What are you writing down?
[44:47.08]That was painful to listen to.
[44:53.38]Nitrogen fixation level is affected by nematode secretions.
[44:56.76]You are a real nerd.
[45:01.68]I like that.
[45:03.46]Keep it up.
[45:14.96]Oh, this is the guy that sells the weapons.
[45:18.59]Ooh.
[45:21.25]Templar's blade.
[45:32.25]It's not even really better.
[45:37.25]15 to 26.
[45:37.83]It's not even really... I mean, it's better.
[45:46.42]The French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[45:50.94]Tinkle surprise.
[45:53.10]Sometimes you get a surprise tinkle.
[45:55.00]And you gotta do something.
[45:55.78]You gotta get rid of it.
[45:56.28]You have to pee.
[45:58.58]But thanks a lot.
[45:59.32]Appreciate it.
[46:00.54]Welcome to the family.
[46:07.29]I bought it.
[46:08.37]I'm sick of looking at this.
[46:12.49]It'll pay for itself.
[46:13.25]Watch.
[46:15.98]I just got my money back.
[46:21.28]It's gonna pay for itself.
[46:22.14]Let me test it out.
[46:25.50]Oh, that's awesome.
[46:31.67]And it's got defense?
[46:33.33]Come on.
[46:37.40]Weren't you guys getting sick of looking at that trident?
[46:43.00]I've been using that trident since the very beginning of this game.
[46:51.41]That's not the concept.
[46:52.39]That's not how pay for itself works.
[46:56.66]Yeah, what I meant was you kill.
[46:59.74]The more things I kill with this...
[47:03.02]I'll be able to sell the things I get.
[47:06.53]And it'll pay for itself.
[47:10.57]Look, I don't gotta explain, but I just drank a two liter of cola.
[47:17.29]Cola.
[47:17.69]I hate that word, by the way.
[47:19.43]Cola.
[47:21.37]I had some- I had some cola this afternoon.
[47:25.57]Uh, what the fuck am I doing?
[47:31.56]Hey, you're a nerd.
[47:32.34]Take this.
[47:38.58]That's a dwarf scroll.
[47:39.52]You should like that.
[47:44.64]As a fellow nerd, I thought that... Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[47:55.35]Stormflare 015 months?
[47:57.61]Is that what I just saw?
[47:58.45]Holy shit.
[48:00.17]That's a long time.
[48:10.08]Thank you, though.
[48:12.44]That's very, very generous of you.
[48:15.15]To stay subscribed for that long.
[48:28.53]He subbed the first day I got the button.
[48:30.63]Hold on a second, hold that thought.
[48:32.59]We got a wild one.
[48:36.58]Oh my god, that was so hard!
[48:41.04]That was so difficult.
[48:55.07]Why don't I accept donations?
[48:56.69]It's just... I don't know.
[49:00.80]Every time it's brought up, I have this conversation.
[49:08.24]I'm just not at the moment 100% comfortable taking donations.
[49:16.63]Not that I'm not comfortable.
[49:18.85]But... And I'll Twitch... That's a 25-inch Ghostfish.
[49:36.04]Why would I ever take Jerry's Trident away?
[49:47.41]I could get a better rod too.
[49:52.78]You find it annoying when streamers spend all their time reading donations.
[49:55.50]That's another thing like I don't...
[49:58.26]Somebody, like, subscribing and saying, like, you know, thanks to that person.
[50:02.99]Obviously anybody that's giving money, essentially directly to me.
[50:08.39]I know, like, I mean, Twitch takes a cut, but it's essentially that person.
[50:16.10]It's so hard to describe and explain, but if you're willing to, like, give money to me,
[50:23.44]It's already, like, that's so, I have nothing else to say besides, like, thanks.
[50:27.96]That's, like, an incredible gesture.
[50:30.42]And you're, like, you know, supporting the channel and all that great stuff.
[50:33.69]But reading donations is not something I really want to do.
[50:41.93]I never intended to get into this to, you know, read a donation ticker.
[50:55.25]Because sometimes people, you know, they write messages, and people expect to have you read their messages, and sometimes people write, like, long messages, and it could be over and over again.
[51:02.45]You get, like, three or four donations in a row, and you end up what I'm doing right now, and it's just talking about it instead of actually, like, playing the game.
[51:16.30]But I'm going to eat this ghost fish, and we're going to go down.
[51:25.50]I would rather be able to just say thanks to somebody for subscribing than spend potentially like two or three minutes accepting the donation, seeing how much it was, reading what they had to say.
[51:37.38]And it's not that I don't appreciate it.
[51:39.74]It's not that I wouldn't appreciate somebody sending me money.
[51:44.26]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[51:52.83]Canaz is back.
[51:54.45]Canaz is back.
[51:56.59]Thanks a lot.
[51:57.51]Welcome.
[51:59.07]I appreciate it.
[52:00.83]And we're done.
[52:05.78]And if you skip over donations, people feel... If somebody donates, like, 30 bucks or something, and you don't, like, read their donation on stream, it's like... Whoa.
[52:14.88]Hold on a second.
[52:17.14]Just gave you 30 fucking dollars.
[52:19.04]Like, you miss it.
[52:20.32]I don't know.
[52:20.62]It's just...
[52:23.46]If you want to support me and the channel in any way you want to slice it.
[52:29.97]The one or two times a year that I have a shirt go on sale.
[52:34.77]You can just buy the shirt.
[52:36.21]Or sub on Twitch.
[52:39.22]You don't have to hand me wads of money.
[52:42.66]It's okay.
[52:51.16]I like this new sword though.
[52:55.49]Just insult your donators like Star does?
[52:57.41]No, I don't want to do that either.
[53:18.73]Tried, it was better.
[53:21.04]I like the spread on this one.
[53:22.06]It does more damage too.
[53:24.76]I can hit more than one person at a time.
[53:27.52]That's a plus.
[53:31.00]But Jerry, I have $1,000 too much and I don't know what to do with it.
[53:34.93]I could probably give you a couple of ideas.
[53:38.99]You could invest that money.
[53:41.43]You could give it to a reputable, high-ranking charity.
[53:48.41]You could buy a gift for somebody in your life, you know.
[53:51.58]How's your mother doing?
[53:52.96]You know?
[53:54.12]Ma, you know, I got... I'm gonna help out with the bills this month.
[53:58.48]Here's a 500 spot.
[54:03.20]Got a lady or a man in your life?
[54:06.92]What's that?
[54:07.98]Going out to dinner?
[54:08.56]To a really nice restaurant?
[54:11.33]We were sharing a great experience together.
[54:15.21]Plenty of things you can do with that money.
[54:27.00]Oh, fuck.
[54:28.22]Oh, fuck.
[54:30.90]It's bedtime.
[54:31.70]Back to bed.
[54:33.56]Who does sub?
[54:34.94]Wolf Pure.
[54:38.46]I think I caught it just barely in time, guys.
[54:42.54]Just barely.
[54:43.46]I don't... Maybe not.
[54:47.66]But, Wolf, thanks for subbing.
[55:02.15]It's gonna be real close.
[55:06.13]As long as I get no tree interference.
[55:13.71]Yeah, we're going back to bed.
[55:16.85]Good night.
[55:24.24]Nice.
[55:34.40]We're back up to 33,000 and look at this harvest tomorrow gonna get even more No, I didn't eat that I'm trying to pick up my crops I
[56:33.82]Back to bed.
[56:35.96]No, I'm just kidding.
[56:42.34]For a second, I almost threw that in there.
[56:43.68]I thought it was trash.
[56:45.14]Looks kind of similar.
[56:46.49]This looks like you took this and cleaned it up and put a little polish on it.
[57:13.57]What am I gonna do with this?
[57:14.47]I can't even put this up.
[57:26.67]Hold on.
[57:36.21]What a disheveled piece of crap house.
[57:49.38]Okay, cool.
[57:58.88]Again, like I said, we are bypassing the right side.
[58:02.04]Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[58:05.51]Rice-a-roni.
[58:07.71]The San Francisco treat just subscribed.
[58:11.85]I love rice-a-roni.
[58:12.91]I love rice pilaf.
[58:15.33]I love...
[58:16.93]Brown rice.
[58:17.51]I'm a big rice guy, guys.
[58:20.15]Huge rice fan.
[58:21.67]So thank you again, Rice-a-roni.
[58:24.72]For joining the club.
[58:33.40]I'm only going to water this side.
[58:35.61]I don't care about this right now.
[58:39.59]I mean, eh.
[58:41.49]Maybe I do.
[58:43.24]We're not doing the corn, then.
[58:44.96]Because I got more important shit to take care of.
[59:01.05]Nooo!
[59:02.57]My control of the thumb finger always does that.
[59:06.37]Moves too far over to the left.
[59:09.07]You have a problem with Rice-a-roni?
[59:15.24]Actually, I don't know if I've had, like, Rice-A-Roni, the brand.
[59:21.05]Like, the name.
[59:21.75]I don't know why.
[59:23.93]I do remember liking it.
[59:27.33]Rice Pilaf, though.
[59:30.81]If you told me that, sorry, Jerma, I hate to give you the bad news, but Rice Pilaf is the only thing you're ever allowed to eat for the rest of your life, I would... I may just shrug my shoulders and be like, okay.
[59:43.72]That's alright.
[59:59.42]We actually are gonna go to the spa.
[60:03.90]SJ, we're making our way to the spa right now.
[60:06.71]After we check on our dung.
[60:13.09]Nothing.
[60:21.15]Rice?
[60:22.20]That's a really odd way to look at it, Jörg.
[60:25.26]Rice looks like dead maggots.
[60:28.49]Well, I can assure you it isn't.
[60:31.38]It's, uh, it's rice.
[60:32.34]Hey, buddy.
[60:49.29]Does he ever go inside of this place?
[61:04.09]The rice pilaf, the way it just sticks together and it has a much deeper flavor.
[61:10.82]I wish I had some right now.
[61:12.58]You know what else is a huge, huge, huge turn on?
[61:18.42]What?
[61:18.74]No, I mean like food.
[61:21.36]I like food.
[61:23.44]Fucking great.
[61:24.76]You know what like a huge food on?
[61:26.60]There we go.
[61:27.10]Food on.
[61:28.90]Fettuccine.
[61:30.65]Fettuccine Alfredo.
[61:31.85]I could eat a gallon of it.
[61:39.63]You know what a huge turn on is?
[61:41.37]I feel fettuccine.
[61:54.86]But man, if I go to like an Italian restaurant and they have a fettuccine Alfredo.
[62:03.80]Can you actually, you can pause while in the spa and actually get the, I didn't know that.
[62:08.28]That's interesting.
[62:17.30]What do I want to do?
[62:17.92]Do I want to... Is it too late to go into the mine again?
[62:26.13]No.
[62:31.55]Let's go.
[62:38.64]Ever been to Vapiano's?
[62:39.86]No.
[62:43.60]Is it in Boston?
[62:44.86]There are a bunch of really fantastic in the North End restaurants in Boston.
[62:53.96]The best piece of fish I've ever had in my life was from a place in the North End.
[62:59.02]And it's sad because I actually don't even remember what name it was.
[63:03.76]I liked it so much, I took one of the guy's business cards.
[63:06.72]I took a business card from this place.
[63:09.71]Because it was a piece of salmon.
[63:11.31]That was like the best piece of fish I've ever eaten in my life.
[63:14.66]And I'm like, do you have a card?
[63:33.07]No, I'm sorry.
[63:37.59]Based Scoob.
[63:41.11]Just subscribed?
[63:46.55]Thanks a lot, Scoob.
[63:48.13]Should I call you Scooby?
[63:54.25]Scooby snack?
[63:56.29]No, thanks though.
[63:56.83]Appreciate it.
[63:58.51]Welcome to the family!
[64:03.86]I'm getting surrounded by bats.
[64:14.39]Well, that was easy enough.
[64:25.54]Mixed greens also sometimes can be pretty good mixed greens.
[64:31.24]If we're on a food, remember we talk about food in these streams.
[64:37.45]When was the last time one of you guys had a good, real good bunch of mixed greens?
[64:42.51]Be honest.
[64:45.67]I'm not talking out of the bag in the microwave mixed greens.
[64:48.82]We're talking fresh, mixed greens.
[65:03.15]Never.
[65:04.31]Never.
[65:04.61]Nope.
[65:11.13]A couple of these now.
[65:11.85]I can get rid of them.
[65:22.72]Yesterday.
[65:23.30]Good.
[65:24.26]Couple days ago.
[65:24.90]Good.
[65:31.46]It closed?
[65:35.85]Vapianos.
[65:47.78]Come on.
[65:48.22]I don't want to spend all night down here.
[65:49.54]There we go.
[65:50.92]Did I get everything up there?
[65:51.64]Yeah.
[65:54.50]Oh, yeah.
[65:56.83]Lots of little dudes.
[66:00.01]Oh, and we got the way down.
[66:02.31]Perfect.
[66:06.15]Shit, I didn't time that right, but it's okay, he missed.
[66:11.11]Lotta resources down here.
[66:14.61]Very much so.
[66:26.44]I got a gold goldfish.
[66:29.16]Ghostfish.
[66:31.36]I'm gonna be alright, I can stay down here for even longer.
[66:36.21]But I do not want a situation like last night to happen again.
[66:40.39]11.30 is when it's my cutoff.
[66:41.75]11.30.
[66:41.77]Need to get at least a few hours of sleep, you know?
[66:47.16]I'm a farmer.
[66:48.10]Crying out loud.
[66:52.18]Cave carrot.
[66:52.74]I'm not gonna actually eat this or sell this.
[66:54.44]There's a community center thing for this.
[66:56.96]I'm gonna hold on to it.
[67:02.35]Everything down there.
[67:06.08]Okie dokie.
[67:11.94]Whoa, what's that?
[67:15.03]There is a new... Have I seen this before?
[67:21.41]Jade, I guess.
[67:22.75]That carrot looks disgusting.
[67:27.07]Well, it is a cave carrot.
[67:29.11]It hasn't been washed.
[67:32.29]It'll be a little better after I wash it.
[67:36.02]Just run it under cold water.
[67:42.95]Oh, that's... Woo!
[67:45.23]Woo!
[67:45.65]Woo!
[67:45.99]Woo!
[67:49.69]Glow ring?
[67:55.55]What does that do?
[67:56.07]Does it brighten up rooms or something?
[68:02.10]Do I not need torches anymore?
[68:05.78]Whatever.
[68:14.82]Didn't have any stats on it.
[68:18.94]Am I going to be radiation man?
[68:21.10]Are people going to be scared of me at town?
[68:22.34]Uh-oh.
[68:37.24]Oh, I have an itchy, itchy head.
[68:38.48]Hold on, itchy head.
[68:40.36]Head itch.
[68:41.34]Averted.
[68:52.49]Almost 10 o'clock.
[68:55.03]Level 65.
[69:00.81]Where was the way down over here?
[69:02.16]Did I get it?
[69:02.60]I got it, like, over here somewhere.
[69:03.54]Did I get it in the very beginning?
[69:04.44]I don't remember.
[69:07.18]There it is, yeah.
[69:12.73]It's with the spawn camp, huh?
[69:16.13]Nice bullshit spawn camp.
[69:17.33]They were just waiting for me at the bottom of the ladder.
[69:29.42]Okay, time to resurface.
[69:41.31]It's time to resurface.
[69:45.87]Goodbye.
[69:55.56]Look, I am glowing.
[70:00.34]That's cool.
[70:10.65]So I have just a giant flashlight on me at all times.
[70:14.21]I feel like this is not safe to have on my body.
[70:19.07]Constantly emitting a gigantic glow.
[70:21.03]I feel like that has health concerns surrounding it.
[70:38.52]Did I pick anything?
[70:39.16]There we go.
[70:45.17]I'm holding on to too many things.
[70:47.71]I gotta dump some of this crap.
[70:51.25]Make a new chest or something.
[71:01.45]What did I say I was gonna get to?
[71:02.63]60 grand?
[71:08.09]Got another big harvest coming in right now.
[71:12.04]Look at that.
[71:12.92]This is gonna be another cool 15,000.
[71:20.62]Something so satisfying about pulling these up and just the sounds.
[71:23.98]It's like popping bubble wrap.
[71:31.67]Except it's a plant.
[71:40.52]Five gold this time.
[71:48.75]It's gonna be a lot.
[71:49.75]Five gold?
[71:50.25]I think the most I've ever had was like two.
[71:51.91]Uh-oh.
[72:14.86]I've officially run out of space.
[72:19.96]That's not good.
[72:24.22]Uh... Where's the wood?
[72:39.01]My farming is so high.
[72:42.26]Box number two.
[72:49.76]Actually, there's coal in the other one.
[72:50.62]I'm gonna keep this.
[72:52.86]Actually, you know, it's time to start to think about things.
[73:01.20]We have... Where are the sprinklers?
[73:05.44]Bee house.
[73:08.24]Cheese press.
[73:10.61]Quality sprinkler.
[73:12.94]Gold bar.
[73:13.48]I still haven't come across gold.
[73:15.48]I can buy it, but do I really want to just spend like $10,000 to make these?
[73:19.78]I don't know.
[73:20.22]Maybe it is.
[73:44.56]If I'm not... How much further down in the mine do I have to go?
[73:49.28]To get to gold?
[73:50.92]Or is it worth me literally buying, like, 20 gold ore from the blacksmith?
[74:02.89]How many quartz do I have?
[74:07.23]Five... I have a ton of quartz.
[74:10.53]Let's make some refined quartz.
[74:18.80]How long does this take?
[74:22.57]Somewhere around 80.
[74:23.11]I have a feeling this is going to take a long time.
[74:36.75]I'll do it.
[74:37.31]Yeah, springtime will do that.
[74:39.11]I have a feeling that's going to take maybe not that long.
[74:48.67]Well, that's cooking.
[74:49.63]I'll do this.
[74:52.82]Anything else on the calendar?
[74:58.04]Anything else important to do?
[75:00.82]Until winter time?
[75:13.59]Take a nap?
[75:14.31]Go back to bed?
[75:15.16]No.
[75:16.42]I've already wasted enough days.
[75:28.78]Find quartz.
[75:31.02]So technically I could make... Like eight?
[75:37.78]Six?
[75:38.24]We'll go with... I'm gonna... Well, let's do it.
[75:41.78]At least with the normal ones.
[75:45.88]I want to have a legit farm.
[75:47.64]A real one.
[75:49.90]None of this fake shit down here.
[75:51.32]I want a real one and I want a bunch of sprinklers because I don't want to ever have to water something ever again.
[76:05.75]No, we'll do the coin.
[76:20.18]It's a game.
[76:20.76]It's not real, Jerma.
[76:23.91]It's real to me.
[76:36.22]Hey, look, a piece of corn.
[76:50.47]So, well, I want to have them for winter.
[76:53.61]Like, I want to have them so I don't have to worry about making them in the winter.
[76:58.92]Even if I don't have to water anything, I will have them in my inventory for spring.
[77:02.64]So I don't have to do this ever again.
[77:05.50]I don't ever want to do this ever again when it comes springtime.
[77:12.64]It's not something I'm inclined to do.
[77:18.72]You got to go.
[77:19.14]Well, good night, Stormflare.
[77:20.46]Thanks for hanging out.
[77:24.54]Yeah, this is not to water plants in winter.
[77:26.76]Can you even plant anything in the wintertime?
[77:30.18]What can you even do in the winter?
[77:33.98]What happens in this game in the winter?
[77:38.24]Does the town come under siege?
[77:39.54]Did I already get these?
[77:47.22]No.
[77:52.99]I got those already.
[78:02.35]Did I get these?
[78:04.91]See, I'm like second guessing now.
[78:06.93]No, I didn't.
[78:07.35]Not these ones.
[78:15.79]So we're gonna give Linus... Stop that.
[78:18.47]I'm gonna bring Linus some honey.
[78:21.51]Because we're almost at four stars.
[78:35.56]You get attacked by the ice giants.
[78:37.32]That would be pretty cool.
[78:39.20]And it turns into a giant tower with defense game where your plants turn into shooters like the corns.
[78:43.86]Just like a corn shooter.
[78:46.51]And plants for zombies.
[78:48.35]This is the origin story for plants for zombies.
[78:52.56]Haha.
[78:59.38]Gold.
[78:59.72]How much is it?
[79:01.08]Not worth doing right now, but I want to be able to be ready for it.
[79:08.15]What about fishing poles?
[79:10.65]You know what?
[79:12.13]Let's go down to the dock.
[79:15.76]Oh, she's selling leaves!
[79:17.62]How much for a leaf, Grandma?
[79:39.72]What?
[79:41.42]That's not cool.
[79:42.08]I can't go in his house?
[79:51.54]I got the money.
[79:52.52]Does it cost resources?
[79:54.98]Or can you just straight up buy them?
[79:59.72]Bamboo pole.
[80:01.40]Fiberglass rod.
[80:02.66]1800.
[80:02.68]So do you actually have to have bait for a fiberglass rod?
[80:14.55]If so, I need to make it.
[80:16.63]I guess I could buy it, but isn't this the crappy bait?
[80:22.75]Let's get it.
[80:29.35]I'm just going to buy one just because I'm curious how this works.
[80:40.01]Do I have to attach it or does it just have to be in the inventory?
[80:42.91]Okay.
[81:11.49]there's nothing else in here I saw somebody said scroll down that's as far as I can go
[81:21.18]You right click it.
[81:22.28]What the hell is right click on a controller?
[81:25.14]Is it... Yeah, okay, it's X. Alright, let's give it a go.
[81:32.10]It's baited.
[81:34.62]Shoot it into the ocean.
[81:35.38]10 inch.
[81:54.21]I'm gonna assume, can you stack them on there?
[81:56.21]Or does it just pull from the inventory?
[82:03.56]Yeah, it just stacks on there.
[82:08.16]Okay, cool.
[82:17.34]The third fishing rod?
[82:18.41]I have to get high enough level?
[82:19.93]Well... Welcome to the fishing stream.
[82:34.97]So, I'm noticing that these have both been gold or silver.
[82:39.87]That's pretty cool.
[82:50.38]Another gold.
[82:50.94]Ah, that's awesome!
[82:53.46]That is awesome!
[83:02.86]I want to bring this into the cave, where it was harder to catch things.
[83:21.85]I thought I got better bait.
[83:25.07]Or the ability to make better bait or something.
[83:32.46]No, maybe it was... No, it was the crab pots.
[83:35.97]I'm thinking of the crab pots.
[83:46.43]Go fish underneath the bridge outside.
[83:48.68]The Joja Mart.
[83:50.24]I'll give it a go.
[83:50.84]I just wanted to see what this did.
[83:52.08]Just giving it a test.
[83:53.66]I really thought he was pissing into the ocean.
[83:56.10]I looked down.
[83:56.84]I saw a stream coming out of him.
[83:57.98]He just walked out and pissed.
[83:59.28]I really thought that's what he was doing.
[84:01.37]And I'm not kidding.
[84:02.13]I thought this big rod here was... Look at how he's holding that.
[84:06.29]Do I hold it like that too?
[84:09.63]Yeah, but he's holding it lower.
[84:10.63]Okay.
[84:17.33]Mine's at my stomach, his is at his crotch.
[84:30.39]I didn't have to move.
[84:35.62]I'm gonna eat all these fish.
[84:37.58]And then go.
[84:38.06]I want to fish in the mine.
[84:40.64]I can eat the seaweed.
[85:09.50]I thought the silo was bad enough.
[85:16.73]You know what?
[85:17.25]Maybe it's just back to bed.
[85:18.25]Can I sell these to him?
[85:23.91]Oh.
[85:24.99]You dick.
[85:28.12]Here, I caught you a special fish.
[85:30.88]You're very welcome, Willy.
[85:35.21]Yeah, it's bedtime.
[85:38.71]Our adventure begins tomorrow again.
[85:40.21]Do I have anything nice for you?
[85:49.46]No, you're just gonna think it's... You're just gonna say everything I have is gross.
[85:56.42]What about... It's a clam.
[85:59.73]No, she's gonna not like that at all.
[86:05.39]I do want to check out that spot.
[86:07.36]There was one spot over here.
[86:11.14]Eat this.
[86:13.86]I got time.
[86:14.34]I don't need to go to bed right now.
[86:22.90]Up here.
[86:28.83]I need to stretch my legs and get some fresh air.
[86:31.42]One of the ten.
[86:35.44]Will she like shiny?
[86:36.44]Is this a waste to give this to her?
[86:42.84]What?
[86:43.80]Wait, wait, wait a second.
[86:45.32]Hold on.
[86:47.38]Hold on, what?
[86:50.14]I gave her a quartz.
[86:57.66]You're gonna eat it?
[86:59.33]That was a quartz, right?
[87:06.63]Okay.
[87:08.69]You're welcome.
[87:16.01]I don't really know what to say about that.
[87:19.27]She's the rock monster from the Neverending Story.
[87:28.36]She's a goron.
[87:30.94]That was odd.
[87:33.08]Back to bed.
[87:39.85]That is slightly concerning me.
[87:48.41]Gonna have some bad indigestion problems come tomorrow morning.
[87:55.40]I don't even want to know what that's gonna be like.
[88:02.06]That thing was huge.
[88:02.92]9,000.
[88:10.15]Yes.
[88:10.35]Almost up to 50,000.
[88:32.07]Let's think practically here.
[88:38.55]I can't make these in the winter.
[88:46.46]I want to think practically.
[88:47.50]Where's the mayonnaise machine?
[88:51.20]Okay.
[88:51.44]Earth crystals.
[88:53.66]Earth crystals.
[89:08.17]I'm going to construct something else.
[89:13.01]I'm going to go to the construction lady.
[89:19.71]Just water these.
[89:24.22]I got more money than God right now.
[89:34.58]Because I want at least one more harvest from these before winter.
[89:45.29]That is a pretty interesting idea.
[89:48.83]So can plants even grow in the winter in this game?
[89:54.82]Is there like a special winter plants or something?
[89:58.80]What was I going to do?
[90:06.28]So I need to go talk to Robin, right?
[90:10.53]It's Robin, I believe, right?
[90:12.19]Right, right, right, right.
[90:14.27]General store.
[90:19.32]The ranch.
[90:22.38]Have I even been in this place one time?
[90:27.40]Trailer.
[90:31.26]What the hell is it?
[90:34.34]Is it a... Oh, there it is.
[90:35.12]Carpenter's shop.
[90:37.70]Straight up.
[90:44.40]Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[90:55.08]That's too bad.
[91:12.27]Hope the farm goes well.
[91:13.11]Good night.
[91:13.41]Have a good night.
[91:13.85]9 a.m.
[91:26.12]Let's just hang out until 9 a.m.
[91:27.66]Eat a piece of algae.
[91:29.68]Good for your teeth.
[91:40.91]Open, open, open, open, open, open, open, open, open.
[91:43.74]I want to go in.
[91:44.30]9 a.m., come on.
[91:52.46]Almost 9 a.m.
[91:56.63]9 a.m.
[92:01.73]Hello?
[92:11.46]Where is she?
[92:11.92]Why is there a little robot in here?
[92:16.30]She's not open on Tuesdays?
[92:20.80]What is with this town?
[92:23.25]And people closing on random work days.
[92:30.67]Every time.
[92:37.53]She only works sometimes.
[92:43.79]You weren't even in there.
[92:45.01]You weren't even inside that building.
[92:46.23]Where'd you come from?
[92:53.11]People are starting to act a little strange, if I do say.
[93:03.29]Okey-dokey found something Yeah, I just picked that up for you.
[93:09.87]You're welcome Was she in bed?
[93:13.35]It's like 1030 Where are you?
[93:19.51]Let's see what she goes.
[93:21.24]I'm curious.
[93:21.70]I want to see what she does on her.
[93:23.08]I'm not working on a Tuesday And she's going down this path
[93:37.26]Okay.
[93:38.94]She's going to go to the general store.
[93:40.08]There can't be a real creep right now.
[93:48.57]I'm hiding behind bushes.
[93:50.33]I don't have to hide.
[93:51.23]How do I walk?
[94:00.34]I don't want to walk.
[94:02.20]Just like everybody else.
[94:03.18]There she goes.
[94:08.65]Oh, yeah, I came in here.
[94:09.65]I need to get some Cheetos.
[94:12.48]I forgot.
[94:12.94]I've got to get paper towels, too.
[94:15.46]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[94:22.44]Orthocone.
[94:23.54]Orthocone.
[94:25.30]Is that a doctor-prescribed ice cream cone?
[94:29.20]Welcome.
[94:29.68]Thanks for stopping.
[94:30.16]Welcome to the family.
[94:32.29]Enjoy your stay.
[94:33.95]I'm going to have to pray this.
[94:34.93]Let's pray.
[94:45.18]I did have a good summer.
[94:46.60]Thanks for asking.
[94:50.46]Now that I'm here, I might as well just sell this stuff.
[95:01.29]Bye-bye.
[95:08.09]Well, I don't know what the hell to do with myself.
[95:10.08]Can I use a sardine?
[95:14.08]As bait.
[95:14.60]I mean, they're tiny, right?
[95:15.88]I guess not.
[95:22.67]Well, you know what time it is.
[95:24.85]Time to go back to the mine.
[95:29.70]I was going to say bed, but I got a lot of daylight.
[95:34.63]Still.
[95:42.58]I got food too.
[95:43.36]I can eat these things.
[95:44.10]I can go down there for a while.
[95:50.73]Another day wasted.
[95:52.07]I didn't know that you can't go to these shops on random days of the week.
[96:11.64]Should be able to make it to 70.
[96:24.59]What does it max out?
[96:25.53]100?
[96:26.51]I think I've asked this question like three times already.
[96:36.16]This line of sight is blocking the damage.
[96:49.13]Lots of crystals!
[97:02.18]There is some gold.
[97:06.30]The ghosts, they can drop gold?
[97:10.69]Interesting.
[97:13.75]Very interesting.
[97:31.03]Oh, I forgot to process those.
[97:32.89]I have like three or four of those now.
[97:34.23]Let's just go.
[97:45.20]I want to try to get to gold so I don't have to buy it.
[97:49.12]That is a very large iron deposit.
[97:55.77]I am grateful for it.
[98:11.01]You can eat the ghost fish, yeah.
[98:12.69]So it evens out.
[98:13.35]I gotta keep track of the time, too.
[98:20.19]I came in here fairly late.
[98:29.14]But we're doing fine.
[98:31.16]We're doing just fine. ...
[98:45.25]Crystal fruit.
[98:45.85]Alright, give me some more gold.
[98:51.13]You know you want to drop it.
[98:58.24]Shithead.
[99:06.10]Four, five, six.
[99:11.90]Two.
[99:13.23]One, two.
[99:14.75]One, two.
[99:25.18]Slimes!
[99:28.94]Look out!
[99:29.48]Ooh, bag!
[99:30.06]Bag!
[99:30.32]Coal bag!
[99:31.50]Is it always coal in here?
[99:33.48]Or is there a chance that anything else could be in here?
[99:35.82]Why is it always coal?
[99:41.03]It's like the Diablo III treasure goblins, but they only pick up coal.
[99:45.68]Where's my legendary axe?
[99:54.37]That's another huge iron deposit.
[99:58.51]I'm gonna have enough iron to last me all winter.
[100:13.81]Crunch.
[100:16.73]Crunch.
[100:19.63]That was tasty.
[100:23.65]Tasty.
[100:33.63]Have I ever played Slime Rancher?
[100:35.01]No, I have not.
[100:37.37]Heard fairly good things about it.
[100:42.51]I heard it's just kind of... similar, like, to this game.
[100:46.39]Not the farming, but... it's a relaxing... sort of just... lean back and slouch in your chair and play.
[100:55.06]Where you have a collection of slime people.
[101:11.73]The ladder's at the beginning.
[101:12.59]I know, I just, there's more to explore over here.
[101:16.06]I still have some time.
[101:17.70]So I'll be fine.
[101:31.29]I'll get the 70.
[101:47.32]69.
[101:47.86]Go ahead, get your jokes out.
[101:49.70]Make your jokes.
[101:52.20]Somebody's gonna make it.
[101:52.98]It's only a matter of time.
[101:57.20]Who's gonna be the first one?
[101:58.08]Because I guarantee you, you will not be the last.
[102:06.33]That noise is louder than everything else too.
[102:14.68]It's 59.
[102:29.66]I have not seen copper.
[102:32.16]That's the first copper I've seen.
[102:33.64]In like 20 floors.
[102:37.59]But I don't really need it anymore.
[102:42.07]10.30, almost time to get out of here.
[102:44.09]But I can get to the next floor.
[102:48.39]I can even it out there.
[102:50.15]Refined quartz?
[102:53.46]What did that come out of?
[102:54.36]Did that come out of a crystal?
[103:07.90]Should I not be slashing those?
[103:09.06]I guess that doesn't matter.
[103:18.03]Come on.
[103:20.75]Get me out of here.
[103:21.54]I just... Can I build the thing?
[103:23.80]I can't build the thing.
[103:24.44]I don't have enough stone.
[103:40.27]Shit.
[103:44.35]Shit.
[103:47.19]Shit!
[103:52.97]Paused, right?
[103:54.89]51.
[103:54.93]How much is it to make the staircase?
[103:56.23]99.
[104:00.15]Oh no, I'm in trouble.
[104:02.07]It's gotta be in this one right here.
[104:07.25]It has to be in this one.
[104:10.05]This one.
[104:12.93]Come on, get me down there!
[104:15.83]Come on!
[104:25.10]Master slingshot cool go Okay, I'm gonna be fine
[104:57.06]I gotta stop doing mushroom.
[105:03.97]If I keep doing this to myself, this is not healthy.
[105:11.25]Sleeping every day from 2 a.m.
[105:14.65]to get the fuck out of my way.
[105:19.26]That's not enough sleep.
[105:20.98]Every day.
[105:22.84]2 a.m.
[105:23.30]to 7 a.m., which is 6 a.m.,
[105:27.38]four hours of sleep forever.
[105:31.60]Okay, don't fuck this up.
[105:34.08]Level five mining.
[105:36.40]Plus one ore per vein or chance for gems to appear in pairs.
[105:43.19]Hmm.
[105:49.55]I kind of like this one.
[105:56.60]Yeah, that doesn't seem that great.
[105:59.77]This... Yeah, I'm going with the gems.
[106:04.45]Okay, well, alright.
[106:05.25]We got two level ups.
[106:08.19]All attacks deal 10% more damage and plus 15 HP or critical strike chance increased by 50%.
[106:17.37]Too bad I sold the dagger.
[106:18.43]Because that would have been good.
[106:31.93]Yeah, I'm just going to go straight up fighter.
[106:37.76]If I still had the dagger, maybe I could do the scout.
[106:42.65]But I don't.
[106:46.91]Don't have to do any work today.
[106:48.31]Haha, nice.
[106:50.57]Get the day off, boys.
[106:51.75]I don't have to do any watering.
[107:20.46]Alright, now I'm gonna go talk to Robin.
[107:23.44]But I need wood.
[107:25.69]I can do that today.
[107:26.39]How much wood do I need?
[107:42.80]Like, probably four or five hundred, I would assume.
[107:44.98]How much do I have?
[107:46.90]Oh, sorry.
[107:47.38]Just bumped into the mic.
[107:50.07]I need more wood.
[108:07.11]Time to chop some trees down.
[108:09.30]I'm gonna get, like, 500 wood.
[108:10.84]Whoa.
[108:11.00]I thought there was a tree just coming down.
[108:16.40]Ah, this is so awful.
[108:17.44]Get out of here.
[108:21.79]Where's my fucking napalm?
[108:23.39]I'm just gonna napalm this whole place.
[108:26.11]So this stops happening.
[108:55.93]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[108:57.28]I can use a bomb.
[108:59.10]I just read that.
[108:59.70]Somebody just said use a bomb.
[109:00.98]I am just... I am like... Let's go.
[109:04.14]Let's go.
[109:06.26]Let's go.
[109:06.85]This is gonna be sick.
[109:13.39]Oh, this is going right in the middle.
[109:15.07]I'm gonna cut a little entrance.
[109:17.90]And this shit is gonna just... Oh, it's gonna be fireworks.
[109:27.17]Go right here.
[109:28.07]Right up here.
[109:28.73]Right here.
[109:30.07]Right here.
[109:32.87]Sayonara.
[109:36.66]Oh, fuck.
[109:40.70]That didn't do anything.
[109:41.36]That didn't do anything.
[109:42.24]That didn't do anything.
[109:43.86]Was I lied to?
[109:44.56]I think I was just lied to.
[110:03.26]How would these trees still be standing?
[110:22.94]All I did was get burned.
[110:26.78]Take several blasts.
[110:30.14]Well, actually, that can cut them down faster now.
[110:35.59]Where's my dog?
[110:36.99]Okay, at first, hopefully I didn't, like, drop a bomb on him. 129.
[111:13.61]Do I have enough to upgrade?
[111:19.86]Don't mind if I do.
[111:20.90]Going to the spa.
[111:37.10]And then we're going to go... Not to the carpenter.
[111:40.26]Because I don't... It's probably at least a couple hundred, right?
[111:43.90]I only have like 200.
[111:44.48]Would I like this game if it was co-op?
[111:54.91]That would be pretty fun.
[111:57.25]Is there a plan for this to be a co-op game?
[112:12.84]I want to see if it's true.
[112:15.18]So if I hit pause... No, it doesn't go up while paused.
[112:28.41]That's going to be so much fun.
[112:32.91]Co-op multiplayer.
[112:40.73]That's so awesome.
[112:42.41]Somebody can be tending to the plants while somebody else is chopping trees down.
[112:45.86]Somebody else is trying to get Linus to be their friend.
[112:48.02]Is it going to be two player or how many players?
[112:52.84]Just two or up to like four or something?
[112:55.36]Now that would be cool.
[112:57.46]Imagine being able to play this game not only with two people but like eight.
[113:01.56]You could have gigantic farms.
[113:19.39]Well, she's right here, so might as well just take a look.
[113:29.15]Yeah, she's right here.
[113:36.48]Now, how much is it?
[113:38.76]Hey, hi there.
[113:41.38]Let's just see.
[113:42.22]Just what do you have?
[113:43.26]Basic window.
[113:46.19]Dressers, tables, budget TV.
[113:52.26]You don't got anything else besides a budget TV?
[113:53.82]You can increase the size of your house and add a kitchen.
[114:01.14]It will cost 10,000 gold.
[114:02.18]And you also need to provide me 450 pieces of wood.
[114:08.59]I need a ton more wood.
[114:14.61]It's wood time, guys.
[114:15.97]I need a better axe.
[114:18.27]How much is that?
[114:21.68]Should I just upgrade the axe and then go to bed for two days?
[114:23.76]Because that's going to take a long ass time.
[114:30.28]I'm going down.
[114:30.80]I'm just going to upgrade my tools.
[114:33.34]I'm going to give it to him.
[114:35.62]I need copper, right?
[114:38.26]That's what I'm doing.
[114:47.94]Loom.
[114:53.44]What does a recycling machine do?
[114:57.64]Charcoal.
[115:02.61]Yeah, we're doing tool upgrade.
[115:05.49]I'm gonna just upgrade all my tools.
[115:07.91]I'm bringing a bunch of copper and a bunch of iron.
[115:10.57]And... We're not gonna be able to do shit for like three days, but, you know, whatever.
[115:18.46]I just got here.
[115:19.10]Has he sold grapes yet?
[115:21.44]You better believe it.
[115:23.46]I already sold a bunch of grapes.
[115:31.91]Okay, iron, copper.
[115:37.61]And let's just do that.
[115:55.43]So... How much... I'm going to need more copper, aren't I?
[115:59.98]Do I have any more copper in my stash?
[116:03.78]I haven't really seen it.
[116:04.74]It's five copper bars.
[116:22.34]So... Four more...
[116:31.63]Meantime, we go out here.
[116:35.27]So I'm going to do steel.
[116:37.20]Both steel watering can and steel pickaxe.
[116:39.70]And I'm going to upgrade the axe to copper.
[116:46.68]Activate Paul Bunyan mode.
[116:48.06]That's correct.
[116:52.00]Jermo, your emotes are creepy as fuck.
[116:56.41]Yeah.
[116:57.77]I mean...
[116:59.87]Are they, though, or are they cool?
[117:02.90]The word you're looking for is super cool.
[117:09.14]Can only upgrade one at a time.
[117:11.04]That's fine.
[117:13.15]We'll do the axe first.
[117:15.53]And then we'll just sleep for three days, come back, put in the pickaxe, sleep for three days, come back, put in the watering can, sleep for three days, and then be at winter.
[117:36.02]What time does he close?
[117:36.84]You know, I'll just go do that now.
[117:39.80]Does he close at 6?
[117:45.88]Can I get there in time?
[117:58.24]Blacksmith closes at 4.
[118:06.89]Back to bed.
[118:20.08]Hey, goodnight biohazard.
[118:21.78]Or bio... biohackzord.
[118:36.94]Back to bed.
[118:50.77]Fall 25th.
[118:58.28]Still raining.
[119:01.68]Still raining.
[119:04.92]I like this.
[119:07.50]Give me more rain.
[119:08.34]Give me a real rainy season.
[119:10.67]So I don't have to do shit out here.
[119:12.15]You guys said I needed a sprinkler.
[119:16.97]I have one gigantic sprinkler.
[119:22.17]In the sky.
[119:22.85]A lot of crops too.
[119:35.60]Lots of crops.
[119:43.00]Day since dog has gotten water.
[119:45.10]Five.
[119:45.46]I'm not sure you know this or not.
[119:50.05]I'm not sure you realize this, but there's currently water falling from the sky.
[119:53.58]So, his bowl has been filled for two days.
[120:21.68]No, give me that back.
[120:30.29]He opens at nine or something.
[120:31.81]I missed a corn.
[120:35.53]I'll go back in a minute.
[120:44.26]dog rainwater, you barbarian.
[120:48.57]Is it any worse than water from your tap of your sink?
[120:52.89]Rainwater probably is arguably might even be better than some of the dirty ass tap water.
[121:33.05]Well, my dog, Otto, I have a water filter on my tap.
[121:42.13]And when I fill up his bowl with water, I turn the nozzle and he gets filtered water.
[121:46.63]This dog drinks filtered water.
[121:50.25]I'll do the best for my auto.
[122:03.70]Thanks, see you later.
[122:05.82]So he can't only do one thing at a time?
[122:09.76]Yeah, he can.
[122:28.95]I could, you know, I'm gonna go to the mine.
[122:31.11]My crops have already been watered.
[122:32.19]I'm at full health.
[122:33.73]Full energy.
[122:35.45]Let's just go.
[122:37.67]Up.
[122:48.38]Acorn.
[122:51.34]What's the quest?
[122:51.88]I like to put an iron bar above the mantle.
[123:05.82]Okay.
[123:13.93]Oh, wait, not that.
[123:14.41]Etalyx.
[123:16.67]Where does Alex live?
[123:22.25]Is he in one of these houses?
[123:24.93]No, he's right up there.
[123:27.11]Right next to the general store.
[123:34.78]Hey, Alex.
[123:42.61]Nah, I'm giving you an iron bar right now.
[123:55.31]Do you like me?
[123:56.49]Do you like me?
[123:58.59]Doesn't like me.
[124:05.35]Well, that's an easy 400 gold.
[124:06.12]I just have to walk 15 feet.
[124:10.25]Do I have anything else in here that I need to do?
[124:12.77]Bottom of the mine.
[124:14.71]Bring George.
[124:15.65]George still wants a hot pepper.
[124:19.61]Mayor still doesn't have any pants on.
[124:22.36]I need to build a chicken coop.
[124:24.56]Let's do some mining.
[124:34.14]I got plenty of food.
[124:36.93]In case it gets hairy in there.
[124:52.10]All these trees... Did I even cut these trees down?
[124:54.28]Oh, hey, Abigail!
[125:06.83]Uh... Will she eat the iron bar?
[125:13.11]I don't know.
[125:13.43]What should I give her?
[125:14.37]I don't have anything at the moment.
[125:15.89]I'm gonna give her an iron bar.
[125:17.09]You hungry?
[125:17.45]You want some iron?
[125:19.76]No, don't go!
[125:20.24]Here.
[125:27.17]Are you serious?
[125:30.20]You ate quartz, but you don't want a beautiful iron bar.
[125:33.74]I thought she was going to want it because she liked the quartz.
[125:35.66]I need some extra salt.
[125:57.32]Here we go.
[126:01.74]New music track?
[126:04.47]Whatever.
[126:04.81]I wasted an iron bar.
[126:06.01]Who cares?
[126:06.51]I'm a fucking billionaire right now.
[126:07.99]Look at all this iron I have.
[126:08.97]I have over a hundred iron ore.
[126:11.73]Not worried about it.
[126:14.17]Not concerned at all.
[126:14.95]It'll be fine.
[126:30.78]That was easy.
[126:37.18]New enemies.
[126:38.80]Skeletons.
[126:39.28]There were zombies before.
[126:40.18]Hmm, that was tough.
[127:02.87]He was not happy about that.
[127:04.39]Did these guys drop anything?
[127:25.20]It's hard to kill.
[127:32.50]For as deep as I am right now, not a whole lot of resources in these last two.
[127:44.29]Whatever.
[127:47.73]Looks like papyrus.
[127:48.77]Yeah, it kind of does.
[127:49.49]Orange skeleton man.
[128:04.50]Wait for me.
[128:08.46]Good thing I have the extra defense from this thing.
[128:10.28]I'm getting... I'm getting railroaded right now.
[128:13.41]It's alright.
[128:20.43]I got plenty of fruit juice.
[128:21.35]I'm fine.
[128:21.75]I'm good.
[128:29.64]I'm good.
[128:31.96]Don't worry.
[128:40.15]There's some iron over here.
[128:43.51]We're getting to 80.
[128:47.93]Shit.
[128:49.37]I missed the iron up there.
[128:51.85]Right when I was clicking the button.
[128:59.03]You're banned from Starz chat.
[129:02.75]Banned.
[129:16.12]I like the way this looks.
[129:19.73]It reminds me... What does it remind me of?
[129:21.29]This is really important.
[129:23.63]Oh, it's like... Oh, an old Muppet movie or Fraggle Rock.
[129:32.13]Like the Fraggle Rock crystals shit.
[129:38.16]It was an old Muppet movie.
[129:42.26]Might have been Fraggle Rock.
[129:43.80]Maybe just a part of the TV show, Fraggle Rock.
[129:57.95]Battletoads?
[129:59.41]Doesn't look like Battletoads.
[130:01.83]Dark Crystal?
[130:02.69]I don't think it's the Dark Crystal, though.
[130:04.15]I'm thinking of one specific part of one of the episodes of Fraggle Rock.
[130:17.30]Alright.
[130:19.18]What were the little... Not the Fraggles.
[130:20.92]The little guys.
[130:21.84]The little Lego people.
[130:25.90]And they used to have these little thin crystals.
[130:30.03]They mined for it.
[130:32.87]What were those little guys called?
[130:34.85]I remember when I was a kid, I used to want to eat the crystals.
[130:37.07]They looked so crunchy and transparent and very fine and brittle.
[130:41.33]Like it was a big, it was like sugary, crispy.
[130:44.31]I wanted to eat them so bad.
[130:53.74]What were they called?
[130:57.43]Little construction workers.
[131:04.50]The Dozers?
[131:05.12]Is that what they were?
[131:05.64]The Doozers?
[131:11.42]All I remember is... I wanted to eat the things that they mined.
[131:21.24]It almost looked like transparent, uncooked spaghetti.
[131:25.98]But shiny.
[131:30.50]Man, did it look good.
[131:32.36]Man.
[131:58.46]It really turns me on.
[132:12.09]Or anything, can I make it to Haiti?
[132:18.70]That's a question.
[132:31.00]I need my tools!
[132:33.58]I've gotta have my tools!
[132:46.53]Yeah, real thin spaghetti, too.
[132:48.07]Not thick.
[132:49.48]Not like ziti.
[132:56.58]Not ziti.
[132:59.14]I almost just replaced ziti with zucchini.
[133:03.07]Zucchini is a vegetable.
[133:08.55]Caught myself there.
[133:10.97]Hold on a second.
[133:11.47]I gotta say, you found it?
[133:13.38]Ronnie found it?
[133:16.14]There it is.
[133:17.88]There it is.
[133:18.20]Yep.
[133:21.94]Look at that.
[133:22.62]Don't you just want to crush those up and eat them?
[133:25.65]I just want... I want to... The whole construction thing behind them, I just want to crush it in my teeth and eat it.
[133:42.14]Ah, the French champagne.
[133:45.85]Has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[133:49.32]Hey, Arky.
[133:50.50]Thanks for the resub, man.
[134:01.70]Is that three months?
[134:04.37]Very cool.
[134:09.73]Welcome back.
[134:13.38]To the... Jerma... To the Jerma Jinglers.
[134:21.38]Come Christmas time, that's what we're going to be called.
[134:24.03]The Jerma Jinglers.
[134:29.37]Oh, crusty mud.
[134:31.03]Nice.
[134:41.00]Eleven o'clock.
[134:43.26]Don't think we're going to make it to the legendary 80.
[134:52.61]In fact, I'm just going to go back now.
[135:00.74]No sense in staying up too late.
[135:21.57]Jeremy, why do you always feel the need to punch me when you see me?
[135:24.71]I know you know me.
[135:25.53]I'm the kid that lived down the street from you, and I always come by every morning.
[135:28.15]You used to ignore me.
[135:29.33]Now you punch my face every time you walk by me.
[135:37.02]I... I'm not punching you.
[135:43.22]If I am, I'm doing it when I'm sleepwalking, and I apologize.
[136:01.58]exposed on stream.
[136:05.80]Exposed as a face puncher.
[136:17.13]Got some honey.
[136:34.85]Any other garbage I can throw in here?
[136:39.17]Yeah.
[136:50.68]I'm just a stream of income.
[136:52.71]A stream of income.
[136:59.08]Just money bags.
[137:01.06]We broke 50k.
[137:02.71]That's a milestone, guys.
[137:03.67]That's a huge milestone.
[137:12.63]Okay.
[137:17.56]I want to pick this up.
[137:19.48]Maybe I can when there's something in it.
[137:30.54]Why can't it be raining again?
[137:36.66]I wish it was raining three days in a row.
[137:41.68]Approach of winter.
[137:43.42]Dark specter.
[137:46.73]Whoa, whoa.
[137:47.41]Is this a festival tomorrow?
[137:51.19]Tomorrow at 10 o'clock.
[137:52.13]A little bit of fair warning would have been nice.
[138:11.83]Get out of here.
[138:20.79]Oh, that is collected.
[138:26.88]This is the final harvest, by the way.
[138:31.68]Whatever comes in the next day or two is the last amount of crops I'm going to be able to do for this year.
[138:36.14]We're talking about a year, guys.
[138:39.70]A full year.
[138:51.31]I'm gonna have a nice little nest egg.
[138:52.61]Alright.
[138:58.17]I'm gonna do some watering.
[139:01.90]So.
[139:03.42]Prepare for the yawn fest, because I can only do this one more time.
[139:28.17]There's a giant mushroom down from my house.
[139:30.91]What are you guys talking about?
[139:35.29]You want me to go investigate the giant mushroom?
[139:39.59]Okay.
[139:41.09]After I water these plants... and go take a bath... I will absolutely do that.
[139:51.96]What's my middle name?
[139:54.18]Uh, Timothy.
[140:17.34]I can't wait to hibernate in the winter.
[140:18.58]It's going to be amazing.
[140:25.23]Okay, this is my name.
[140:27.61]Jeremy Timothy Didledoter.
[140:29.73]What the fuck is that last?
[140:32.29]Didledoter.
[140:37.24]Jeremy Timothy Toodle Dutes.
[140:42.45]These are great last names.
[140:45.85]Jeremy Toodle Dutes.
[140:50.83]I'm going to start going by that.
[140:51.83]Toodle Dutes.
[141:04.36]Toodle Dutes.
[141:06.90]I like it a lot.
[141:14.58]Shit's overgrown.
[141:15.34]I can't even tell if I'm hitting the right... I don't even care.
[141:17.08]These are dumb grapes.
[141:17.80]Who cares about the grapes?
[141:21.17]Sounds like a fake name.
[141:38.83]Well... It very well could be.
[141:44.42]I mean, Toodle Dudes is not real.
[141:48.59]But it's great.
[141:55.41]Why did the sound just stop?
[141:56.31]That was a really weird, abrupt sound effect ending.
[142:00.93]Am I exhausted, really?
[142:11.82]The pomegranate.
[142:21.48]Pomegranates are a weird breed.
[142:27.57]Have you guys ever eaten a pomegranate?
[142:31.79]Like, you went to the supermarket, you bought one off the rack, and you got home with a full pomegranate?
[142:40.25]It's, um... This is the dumbest fruit ever to eat.
[142:45.59]They taste really good, and they're really good.
[142:47.27]Like, I love pomegranate juice, and, like, pomegranate flavoring.
[142:50.97]But eating an actual pomegranate is a monumental pain in the ass.
[143:01.96]Not to mention, when you cut the thing open, it looks like the inside of somebody's intestines.
[143:07.32]Looks like a beehive.
[143:08.30]Like, if you cut a beehive in half, that's what the inside of a pomegranate looks like.
[143:12.24]Or like an anthill.
[143:22.84]Okay, what do I want to do?
[143:23.74]Sell all this and then... It shouldn't be.
[143:27.08]No, back to spa.
[143:37.01]That's it, right?
[143:40.05]Spa day.
[143:47.07]Yeah, it's like eating a sweet ant colony.
[143:54.50]Wanted criminal.
[143:55.60]Jerry Timothy Squeaky Squawk Toodle Doots.
[143:58.57]Seven counts of burglar ars... Burglar... Burglar Arsenal Arsony.
[144:04.66]That is an odd... Burglar Arsenal Arsony.
[144:26.82]Ants are high in protein.
[144:30.44]Wasn't there an article that said that in like a hundred years or something, in the not so distant future quotes, people are going to get most of their nutritional shit from bugs.
[144:46.21]Like a lot of our nutritional value will come from grasshoppers or ants or something.
[144:52.07]and 500 years down the road, it's not gonna be, oh, gross bugs.
[144:55.52]You're gonna be like asking, oh yeah, can I, yeah, on my ice cream cone, can you put, can I get some bugs on that, please?
[145:00.52]Yeah, thank you.
[145:01.10]It's gonna be that normal.
[145:05.02]There was an article for everything.
[145:09.10]That's true, Jim.
[145:19.64]Supposedly their meat is really efficient.
[145:24.11]Yeah, there's like trillions and trillions of them.
[145:28.69]Right?
[145:29.81]Maybe even more than that.
[145:41.70]Now that's going to be one of those things that it's going to take lifetimes for people to want to accept that.
[145:48.51]You have to from birth be taught that bugs are good to eat.
[145:55.49]I don't care who you are.
[145:57.13]If that's not something that you were brought up on from birth, you're gonna have a lot of trouble with it.
[146:05.88]Three out of ten still... You know what?
[146:07.94]I got honey.
[146:09.72]I got something for you.
[146:10.46]You like honey, don't you?
[146:13.16]You look like a real honey kind of guy.
[146:15.90]You're very welcome, Linus.
[146:22.91]Well, see you later.
[146:31.62]Crabs and lobsters are just giant bugs anyways.
[146:34.57]Yeah, but some people even have trouble eating lobsters and crabs because of how odd they look and how weird they are.
[146:44.74]Has it been two days?
[146:47.02]Can I check on my, uh... Let's see if I can get my axe.
[146:55.07]Whatever, let's go down to the mushroom.
[147:05.06]Frogs are good.
[147:05.78]Well, frogs aren't bugs.
[147:07.17]I mean, we're talking mainly bugs.
[147:12.11]When I say we're talking bugs, guys, we're talking like grasshoppers, ants, beetles, spiders.
[147:21.33]Would you eat a spider?
[147:22.07]I wouldn't.
[147:27.00]See, like ants are one thing, just regular black ants.
[147:30.68]Not like fire ants, just regular ants.
[147:35.22]I feel like it wouldn't be that huge of a deal to me.
[147:40.25]If I knew they were clean.
[147:44.39]There were three doctors and two scientists that were standing around in a circle around me while I was about to eat it.
[147:51.43]And all of them were just like, yeah, that's delicious.
[147:53.68]You go ahead.
[147:54.66]The nutritional value is off the charts.
[147:56.82]And it's great.
[147:57.80]It's better for you than eating an apple.
[148:00.58]Maybe, I don't know.
[148:05.12]One of those scientists says it might not be a good idea.
[148:07.94]I'm... It's gone.
[148:19.19]Alright.
[148:19.73]Where is this supposed to be?
[148:21.69]People are saying there's like a mushroom south of my house.
[148:25.17]How far south?
[148:25.77]Like where?
[148:26.13]Am I even going the right direction?
[148:35.95]Look at all that trash.
[148:53.40]Kind of want a new hat.
[148:57.77]No, I can't take the duck hat off.
[149:00.61]It's on the farm.
[149:01.77]Whatever.
[149:05.22]I needed to waste some time anyways.
[149:17.18]We're talking about like cooked ants.
[149:20.72]I am taking that.
[149:22.32]That's the only step I'm taking right now.
[149:24.05]Cooked ants.
[149:35.16]I couldn't eat a live bug.
[149:38.54]I feel the same way.
[149:39.48]Eating a live bug to me is the same thing like eating a live... any animal or something.
[149:45.00]No, God, it would be so horrible.
[149:46.74]I would never be able to do it.
[149:49.54]Eating a live bug.
[149:50.60]Seriously, it hurts me.
[149:54.92]Alright, where's this mushroom?
[149:56.76]Oh, it looks like a tree.
[149:57.72]I thought this was a tree.
[150:00.63]What do you want me to do to it?
[150:03.99]Should I cut it down?
[150:04.99]I can't cut it down.
[150:09.51]I don't have my axe.
[150:16.22]My axe is being upgraded right now.
[150:18.38]I looked at it.
[150:35.91]Back to bed.
[150:38.57]You know the drill.
[150:48.31]Put a tapper on it?
[150:52.01]Ooh.
[150:54.13]Seed maker, quality fertilizer, and iridium sprinkler.
[150:58.25]Okay.
[151:04.27]Okay.
[151:12.66]Alright, let me go get my axe.
[151:19.53]And then we'll upgrade the watering can.
[151:23.45]Oh, look at this.
[151:27.97]The pickaxe, sorry.
[151:30.75]Watering can can wait.
[151:31.50]This is the last harvest, by the way.
[151:35.51]This is it.
[151:36.85]So say goodbye, because I'm not watering them anymore.
[151:39.56]I don't even care.
[151:40.04]I have so much money, and it would be such a pain in my ass right now.
[151:46.12]Maybe if there's time, I'll come back and do it.
[151:50.02]But that is the last harvest, at least for cranberries.
[151:53.54]There's still a couple of stragglers, I think, for grapes that I haven't gotten.
[151:58.97]But I'll do that later.
[152:16.08]There's a festival today, yeah.
[152:18.23]There is a festival today.
[152:19.15]That asshole's probably not going to finish it.
[152:31.23]Oh, looks like I am watering my plants.
[152:40.50]Give me a nice spicy wasp burrito.
[152:42.70]Ugh.
[153:19.66]Stretch those legs I Love the light really looks like he's doing squats.
[153:33.79]Oh
[153:39.23]Just for fun, because I have time to kill.
[153:42.83]I guess I'll do these one more time.
[153:44.15]It's going to be... It's four days, right?
[153:47.08]Is it 31 days or 30?
[153:49.16]Because if it's 30 days, then this is worthless for me to do.
[153:54.86]But whatever.
[153:55.30]The festival isn't even starting.
[153:57.16]Okay.
[154:09.06]Yeah, forget about the corn.
[154:10.00]There's still some up here that haven't been gotten.
[154:24.51]Okay, whatever.
[154:24.97]Eat the gold hazelnut.
[154:28.00]It's 28?
[154:28.16]Oh, shit.
[154:31.94]Shit.
[154:44.25]Yeah, the bus has been just sitting here for a whole year.
[154:50.51]What?
[154:54.49]When does it start?
[154:56.67]I can't even go to town today?
[154:57.94]What the hell am I supposed to do?
[155:13.54]I guess I can just go fishing in my pond.
[155:15.23]Because I don't have... Okay, well, I'm gonna go fishing.
[155:29.56]Wrong way.
[155:33.36]Go to the spa all day.
[155:37.97]Coca-Cola.
[155:44.55]I can't do anything until 10 p.m.
[155:48.51]Yeah, I'll cut the grass.
[155:55.51]I'll clean up.
[155:57.89]After I catch one fish.
[156:05.97]Just one.
[156:08.55]And by one, I mean second Coca-Cola Classic.
[156:19.01]I need to go get my blade.
[156:20.09]Can you eventually make a lawnmower?
[156:37.97]Isn't there little patches of grass you can knock up?
[156:43.65]Like little holes?
[156:44.29]Yeah, like that.
[156:45.53]Can I dig that up?
[156:47.99]I don't think I've done that one time this whole game.
[156:53.07]The entire time I've been playing.
[156:55.25]The 15 plus hours I've spent in this game.
[156:58.11]I don't think I've tried this once.
[157:06.86]Can't you do that?
[157:11.48]Let's cut the grass.
[157:29.93]What a waste of a day.
[157:30.73]I don't need water.
[157:44.28]The dog is fine.
[157:46.32]He's fine.
[157:47.24]See?
[157:47.54]There he goes.
[157:51.16]I gave it to him.
[157:53.61]You guys can all chill.
[158:04.30]Build a silo.
[158:06.44]Can I even build a silo?
[158:13.60]Tapper.
[158:14.20]Charcoal.
[158:15.66]Wait.
[158:16.68]Recycling machine.
[158:21.64]Recycling machine.
[158:31.18]Yep.
[158:31.78]Let's see what happens.
[158:44.30]So what do I do with this?
[158:50.69]Cool.
[158:52.89]What do I get?
[158:53.39]How long does it take to recycle a piece of paper?
[159:07.43]I would have already recycled it by now.
[159:12.08]Fine, I'll come back.
[159:14.18]How do I waste more time?
[159:21.74]I should get more stuff to recycle.
[159:27.45]It takes all day?
[159:28.29]My god.
[159:40.00]They cleared that out.
[159:42.24]Now Robin builds it.
[159:48.20]That's just dandy.
[159:50.04]Thanks for the torch.
[159:52.10]Three torches.
[159:53.08]Can I put that back in?
[159:53.90]I need to do a little bit of consolidating here.
[160:03.87]I want
[160:05.89]Minerals and ore to be in this one.
[160:08.51]Fruits, vegetables, and other materials.
[160:11.82]Okay, here we go.
[160:12.66]It's going to take me a second.
[160:36.12]Quartz.
[160:51.23]Okay.
[160:54.07]And then this one is going to be all the other stuff.
[161:20.84]Okay.
[161:30.74]This is like my junk.
[161:35.34]Not junk, but just... I need to separate this stuff.
[161:39.39]Because then this is just materials.
[161:41.81]You know what I mean?
[161:42.23]I can come over here and know exactly what's in here.
[161:43.81]What time is it?
[161:52.14]I'm just going to go to the spa for seven hours.
[162:09.99]Organization system.
[162:11.07]I know, I get to organize.
[162:14.13]Truth be told, here's the truth.
[162:16.06]You want the truth?
[162:17.24]I can give it to you if you'd like.
[162:20.28]Truth of the matter is this.
[162:22.34]When I first downloaded and installed this game and turned the stream on, when I was like, oh, sure, I'll try it.
[162:30.26]I did not think that, I didn't know I was going to even really care about it.
[162:33.78]I thought it was going to be like a fun little thing, stream it for like three or four hours.
[162:36.57]Oh, that was kind of cool.
[162:38.57]That's, like, I did a lot of dumb shit.
[162:40.63]Like, I made a lot of stupid mistakes in the first, like, five hours of playing that just kind of cascaded the rest, cascaded, cascaded the rest of it.
[162:50.22]And now that I kind of care now, it's taken me this long to organize my stash.
[162:58.45]And that's the truth.
[162:59.01]It's a marion.
[163:12.34]No, it's not time yet.
[163:13.60]I'm just going to chill in here.
[163:23.60]I did go all in on green.
[163:25.10]I won the starfruit.
[163:29.31]What's going on, Bob?
[163:30.51]Welcome back from work.
[163:33.59]Hope you had a good day.
[163:34.65]Hope you made a lot of money.
[163:44.50]You debating on getting this game or not?
[163:45.82]What do I think?
[163:48.28]Get it.
[163:51.43]Get it.
[163:51.93]It's definitely fun.
[163:53.69]I would say get it.
[163:54.37]You'll probably enjoy yourself.
[164:02.95]For the amount of money that this game is, there's no real reason I can tell you not to buy it.
[164:12.96]If this game was 30 bucks, I'd say... Mmm...
[164:21.06]Maybe.
[164:23.13]If this was in the 30 to 40 range, I don't know why it would be, but if it was, I would happily pay $25 for this game.
[164:38.63]$15 is extremely reasonable.
[164:41.01]More than reasonable for what you get.
[164:44.51]There's more content in this game than most AAA games I've played in the last couple months at least.
[164:56.00]Alright, time to go.
[164:58.70]So maybe it is worth, like, 30 bucks.
[165:01.20]40.
[165:01.80]But it would be a hard sell at 25 plus for the developer, is all I'm saying.
[165:06.65]And he put it at a great price.
[165:19.82]Is this festival ready yet?
[165:26.80]Seems a lot like Terraria.
[165:29.64]Yeah, it's... I mean, I like the camera angle in this better than Terraria.
[165:35.92]Terraria was a little too pulled back for me.
[165:39.21]It was all... I mean, this technically is on... It's like looks top-down, but it's technically... What the fuck?
[165:46.03]10 o'clock.
[165:48.60]I like this perspective.
[165:51.81]It feels more involved.
[165:53.55]Whereas Terraria, like I said, is more pulled back into the side.
[165:56.92]And Terraria was a lot more dangerous of a game.
[166:08.87]This is just relaxing.
[166:11.27]What the hell are you doing here?
[166:15.22]I was this close to mopping in bed.
[166:19.64]Moping in bed the entire day.
[166:21.06]Why did I read it like that?
[166:23.30]What's this guy's deal?
[166:24.00]What's going on?
[166:28.02]I don't have anything to give you.
[166:30.48]Sorry.
[166:30.80]Let's go to the festival.
[166:34.28]It starts like right now.
[166:40.94]He went in there quick.
[166:43.07]Let's see if he comes out.
[166:47.71]Come on, you know you want to go to the festival.
[166:51.60]Come on.
[166:52.30]No, he doesn't want to go.
[166:55.72]What the hell?
[167:03.52]They have skeletons locked up?
[167:05.40]A real odd bunch.
[167:17.71]Why did I do that?
[167:20.73]I wanted to put them in front of my house, but who cares?
[167:22.53]I just have a lot of money.
[167:31.14]He did come down.
[167:38.53]But Marnie, I want to go in the maze.
[167:40.99]I'm not scared.
[167:41.91]Okay.
[167:47.23]Eek, I'm too scared.
[167:49.31]Oh, don't worry, darling.
[167:50.27]Come with me.
[167:50.83]We'll go together and we'll fight the monsters as a team.
[167:56.19]Or not.
[167:56.45]Is this supposed to be... This is Halloween.
[168:05.41]How come nobody has any costumes on?
[168:06.68]It would be cool if we could put Halloween costumes on.
[168:20.99]Okay, well, don't really care.
[168:23.57]Mayor, what's going on?
[168:25.98]Where's the haunted maze?
[168:33.22]Down?
[168:36.68]Over here?
[168:39.60]Up?
[168:40.38]Left?
[168:48.65]No, don't leave.
[168:56.84]It's gonna make me leave.
[168:57.62]There's no end.
[169:01.23]I just...
[169:27.59]Is there anything important there that I need?
[169:30.98]Or does it not even matter?
[169:32.00]Is there anything that I need there?
[169:34.02]Because if you're telling me there's like a little, like a doll I can put as a furniture in my house, I don't care.
[169:46.22]There's a star drop there.
[169:51.21]Golden pumpkin. 2,500.
[169:55.71]But I have to do that all day again.
[169:59.46]Do you guys understand?
[170:00.66]I have to do the boring sit in the spa all day again.
[170:09.34]Do you really want me to do that again?
[170:15.73]I'm not sure it's worth it.
[170:19.83]It's not worth it.
[170:21.51]I'm not.
[170:22.77]I get bored too easily.
[170:24.19]Back to bed.
[170:34.35]I don't know why that happened.
[170:37.89]I'll just, yeah, I'll do it next year.
[170:38.99]It's fine, guys.
[170:46.36]It's so funny, like, Ronnie keeps giving me these little tidbits of advice when it's the utmost necessary, you know what I mean?
[170:55.93]Like, super necessary little tips.
[171:02.59]You're not sure if sitting in a spa all day is worth $2,500?
[171:09.42]That's a big payout.
[171:12.88]But look, I got my pumpkins, see?
[171:14.06]And this is what I was gonna do.
[171:14.92]Get me...
[171:32.46]Move out of the way!
[171:33.18]No, I have to!
[171:43.78]Come on!
[171:44.26]That's why I bought these!
[171:49.08]Why can't I... That's the only spot I can put them.
[171:51.76]This is the only place I can put it.
[171:55.29]Oh, my obsessive compulsive is taking over.
[171:58.17]I have to put it there.
[172:05.90]I hate it.
[172:21.07]I hate it, but it's gonna stay.
[172:22.37]Look at that, one more harvest.
[172:33.82]Now I can go get my tools.
[172:53.65]Stop trying to eat the grape, you dummy.
[173:03.99]Watering can.
[173:06.81]Corn.
[173:13.92]Okie dokie.
[173:19.20]I got one more day.
[173:24.64]Oh well, let's get bulldozed anyways.
[173:33.90]Shit is getting bulldozed.
[173:35.72]Moving the mic.
[173:36.26]I'm gonna lie down.
[173:38.46]I'm lying down right now in my chair.
[173:49.74]I got one more honey harvest.
[173:51.24]Cool.
[173:51.88]Very cool.
[174:05.56]Where was my consumer?
[174:06.72]Oh, this one.
[174:10.02]Nine honeys.
[174:24.15]Okay.
[174:25.31]Put these in the box.
[174:37.54]And let me get my tool.
[174:40.60]So I can actually chop down trees at a reasonable rate.
[174:47.08]Yeah, I got my pickaxe.
[174:48.19]I'm going to do that next.
[174:50.29]Wait.
[174:51.95]Very important.
[174:53.19]Forgot the bars.
[175:06.27]Having five of these is important.
[175:15.66]Sleep eternal, dog.
[175:17.04]I'm so hungry.
[175:27.65]Whose dog is that?
[175:28.69]That's what I want to know.
[175:30.59]Whose dog is that?
[175:38.15]Hey, Alex.
[175:40.01]How are you?
[175:44.61]Zero to ten.
[175:46.23]Thanks.
[175:49.54]Fuck you, buddy.
[175:55.76]Oh, my throat is starting to be... Not so good.
[176:00.07]Remember, I said at the very beginning of the stream that I think I'm getting sick.
[176:06.86]My throat's getting all scratchy.
[176:10.06]There's the axe.
[176:13.74]Hello?
[176:14.97]I would like for you to make me a steel pickaxe, please.
[176:23.43]Bye.
[176:27.31]Now let's chop some trees down with our improved axe.
[176:37.20]Just thirsty.
[176:37.82]No, I got a drink right here.
[176:39.24]Didn't you hear me slam this thing earlier?
[176:40.74]I still got it.
[176:53.71]There's a lot of good places to walk around here.
[176:55.41]Yeah, especially when you got some cool moon shoes like me.
[177:08.45]She's got nice decorations.
[177:24.80]Come over here.
[177:27.95]Tulip.
[177:31.09]Kill large red mullet.
[177:34.03]Was this the 80s?
[177:46.14]I don't want you.
[177:46.68]I don't want you and your stuff.
[177:50.41]1, 2, 3, 4.
[177:51.29]I messed up again.
[177:51.99]Oh, it's okay.
[178:10.76]I don't get it.
[178:11.44]Alright, let's see.
[178:19.99]This is no better than the last one I had.
[178:24.66]This is no better than the last axe I had.
[178:28.12]It's not... It's taking the same amount of time.
[178:32.42]I don't get this.
[178:34.42]What's the point of having this be upgraded if it takes the same amount of time?
[178:37.50]Do you actually get more wood?
[178:43.00]Or... Why did I do this?
[178:58.23]Alright, you can get her to the stumps.
[178:59.77]Okay.
[178:59.99]Well, that's a bed.
[179:01.79]That's a bed.
[179:05.25]Yeah, that's B-E-D.
[179:06.81]That's a bed.
[179:14.84]These things are a big eyesore.
[179:16.10]I'm glad I can actually move these now.
[179:17.84]It takes so much effort to cut trees down.
[179:36.24]Use so much... Get so exhausted by doing this.
[179:43.05]Do like... Damn it.
[179:46.37]Not back to bed.
[179:48.21]Back to spa.
[180:17.13]Wait a minute, do I want to... What do I want to do?
[180:29.14]Spa zone.
[180:37.86]You do realize, guys, after I come out of this, going right back to chopping trees down.
[180:47.20]This is a tree day.
[180:49.80]Nothing more, nothing less.
[180:50.76]I'm assuming the hardwood can be used to make something sweet.
[181:21.96]Yeah, there never is anybody else at the spa.
[181:24.34]At least when I'm here.
[181:24.96]This is my spa appointment.
[181:29.04]You have to sign up.
[181:29.74]There's a sheet that you sign up.
[181:32.63]I have it from... Just came out of the spa.
[181:37.17]I got a log over my head.
[181:38.07]How are you?
[181:49.85]Wait, I need to talk to him.
[181:56.48]I don't like to stay in one place for too long.
[181:58.22]Four?
[182:02.18]By the way, this is so claustrophobic.
[182:07.30]And I'm sorry.
[182:08.52]When your toilet right there is this close to where your face is, that can't be comfortable.
[182:17.73]He takes a dump in here and he puts his face right here and goes to bed.
[182:20.63]That's a chamber pot.
[182:25.13]Gross.
[182:47.51]Alright, let's go.
[182:48.73]Chopping trees down until it's time for bed.
[182:50.83]I'm going to say like 1130.
[183:01.20]I'm going to get a lot of sap from this too, which is good.
[183:12.43]That'll help in a lot of cases.
[183:14.91]The tongue is just...
[183:18.26]Do you like how the dog was just barking all over, just every two seconds barking, and then mid-bark fell asleep?
[183:26.20]Watch out, I don't want to hit you with this.
[183:37.33]Just crashed a tree on him.
[183:40.55]He's alright.
[183:48.75]Yeah.
[183:52.11]Safe and sound.
[183:52.89]He's got his water now.
[183:53.79]How much wood do I have?
[184:06.89]200.
[184:06.95]It takes so much wood to get anything done, building-wise.
[184:18.42]Kinda crazy.
[184:33.72]It's almost time for bed.
[184:34.96]And we can go and hopefully have enough to build... So what should I build first?
[184:40.92]Kitchen?
[184:44.37]So I can cook or build a chicken coop or an animal thing.
[184:50.03]What's more useful to me in the long term?
[185:01.80]That's enough time for bed.
[185:12.13]Last little treat.
[185:14.74]Good night.
[185:19.54]I should chop the mushroom down?
[185:23.47]Should I?
[185:23.83]I feel like I'm gonna get a lot of shit for doing this.
[185:47.18]Don't do it.
[185:49.02]Murder it.
[185:49.72]Tap it.
[185:50.32]Don't preserve it.
[185:53.93]Chop it right the fuck down.
[186:02.39]Chop down that Super Mario.
[186:06.37]This does look like a Mario 64.
[186:08.94]Please don't take my Cap Monkey level asset.
[186:17.24]I'll leave it.
[186:19.42]You can stay for now, mushroom.
[186:25.52]Pray to it?
[186:26.20]Pray to the mushroom?
[186:28.36]What am I wishing for?
[186:29.46]Am I going to get like three wishes?
[186:31.22]If I don't chop it down?
[186:37.47]Ooh.
[186:42.65]Forester or gatherer?
[186:46.02]I don't really care about that.
[186:47.27]Chance for double harvest of foraged items.
[186:53.67]Why would you sell wood?
[186:56.03]Just cut trees down and sell it?
[186:57.27]I feel like this is way... Is this effective?
[187:04.70]I'm going to go gatherer.
[187:17.68]What's the application of doing the other one?
[187:26.73]Oh!
[187:30.29]No!
[187:32.26]Look at these little dead faces!
[187:35.00]Why did I buy these?
[187:37.20]I bought those and they were there for one day and it was over a thousand gold.
[187:42.49]It's like 1500 gold for those.
[187:44.79]Good purchase.
[187:46.53]What an investment.
[187:47.65]They're rotten.
[187:48.23]Where's the mushroom?
[188:01.78]Where's the mo- the mushroom's gone!
[188:07.71]It's right here.
[188:08.77]It's okay.
[188:09.67]It's still got a root.
[188:15.29]Alright, let's clean this up and get this going.
[188:18.31]You know what I'm saying?
[188:26.69]Fuck this whole place.
[188:34.47]We are doing a total redesign.
[188:39.98]Hit the reboot button, because that's what we're doing.
[188:50.82]First, let's see.
[188:51.84]Mom sent me a care package or something.
[188:53.90]Yep, told you.
[188:56.01]How are things going?
[188:56.59]You must really be making a fortune on that farm.
[189:02.35]Wouldn't you like to know, Ma?
[189:04.35]Don't forget your dear old mother when you're a millionaire.
[189:07.59]Enjoy the cake.
[189:11.66]I'm gonna throw this cake in the trash and maybe somebody can find it like I did that time.
[189:20.51]Okay.
[189:21.13]I don't care about losing those.
[189:34.27]Remember, this is a total redesign, guys.
[189:37.43]We're changing our philosophy.
[189:54.94]So correct me if I'm wrong, but plant-wise there is nothing I can do in the winter, right?
[190:03.86]Now this game has some supernatural, majestical, magical things.
[190:09.40]Is a magic winter plant one of them?
[190:19.39]I don't think so.
[190:31.22]Special winter seeds.
[190:34.51]Well.
[190:37.25]Let's throw the cake in the trash now.
[190:41.99]Get rid of all this crap.
[190:43.25]450. 450.
[191:08.50]I think I'm gonna go with the kitchen.
[191:21.04]These aren't these little nice decorations.
[191:24.68]Nice spiral.
[191:28.42]New quests.
[191:30.74]Don't go ha- Well, actually, no.
[191:34.15]I don't wanna waste my time.
[191:37.03]What do you sell in the winter?
[191:39.89]Grass starter.
[191:40.91]Vinegar.
[191:43.91]You don't sell shit in the winter, do you?
[191:49.88]Maybe I'll do chickens?
[191:50.72]Yeah, I'm gonna do a kitchen.
[191:58.90]It's about time that I actually start to be able to cook food rather than eat raw fish every day.
[192:17.88]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[192:24.80]Grump clump.
[192:26.62]With the four months.
[192:29.15]Thank you so much.
[192:30.81]So much.
[192:32.67]I appreciate it.
[192:35.99]That's a long commitment.
[192:43.45]10,000 gold, which is nothing for me.
[192:44.65]And 450.
[192:45.43]Let's make a kitchen.
[192:50.83]I'll get started tomorrow.
[192:54.46]Well, isn't that just wonderful?
[193:03.40]Still at 54,000.
[193:07.39]I wonder how close he is.
[193:11.15]So I can actually go back to the mine.
[193:16.72]That scared the hell out of me.
[193:19.28]Hey!
[193:19.86]Just the person I wanted to see!
[193:25.34]Now, let me ask you something.
[193:28.80]Do you like cake?
[193:38.25]Boys and girls, we got another heart.
[193:42.22]You're welcome.
[193:44.36]Uh... So, later, uh, hold on, hold on, uh... So, later today, um, I was thinking maybe you could come over and we could, uh, read some comic books and play some Nintendo... Okay, so I'll call you.
[193:59.47]I'll call you.
[194:07.51]Where are we going?
[194:20.99]I like the way the winter looks.
[194:22.47]It's really icy and cool.
[194:27.75]Gives me chills.
[194:28.81]Look at all these stupid scarecrows.
[194:47.15]And... Damn it.
[194:56.41]I gotta get some bait and fish.
[194:57.67]Cause it is winter and there's new fish in the winter time.
[195:11.46]Oh shit!
[195:14.79]I was just choked.
[195:18.95]Come on!
[195:19.61]That was so hard!
[195:29.56]I want to get one of those.
[195:30.40]Are you kidding me?
[195:32.98]These winter fish are nuts!
[195:46.52]Now he's just toying with me.
[195:47.46]A lingcod.
[195:52.35]Lingod.
[195:53.51]An Abraham lingcod.
[196:08.50]I need bait.
[196:21.64]Yeah, these winter fish are nuts.
[196:23.10]I don't know if it's the spot I'm in or the type of fish that are over here.
[196:30.91]Tiger trout.
[196:32.25]Cool.
[196:43.84]Next level jokes I never said it was a good joke One more time and I'm gonna go to sleep
[197:20.56]4 p.m.
[197:20.96]bedtime.
[197:21.36]One more.
[197:26.21]I want to get a perfect.
[197:35.59]Nope, that's not going to happen.
[197:43.90]Last time.
[197:44.92]Last time.
[197:49.80]Perfect.
[197:53.10]Perfect.
[197:54.56]Yes.
[197:55.02]Okay.
[197:55.42]I'm satisfied now.
[197:57.77]Ooh.
[197:58.95]That's a new one.
[198:15.78]No, it's not a mayo stream.
[198:18.12]It's not going to be a mayo stream for like another week.
[198:36.61]Do I have anything to throw in?
[198:40.38]I'll just get rid of the fish.
[198:45.88]Take this wood path, too.
[198:46.93]I don't want it.
[198:48.29]Take this shitty gravel path.
[198:49.47]We're not going to do gravel.
[198:50.75]We're going to do something awesome.
[198:53.61]We're going to do, like, cobblestone.
[198:55.84]Something cool.
[199:04.71]Those seem to have been worth a lot.
[199:09.25]Yeah, they were.
[199:17.22]Please have my axe be ready so I can go to the mine.
[199:20.86]This is a... What are you doing to my house?
[199:27.87]Oh, that's right.
[199:28.87]You're supposed to do that.
[199:31.15]I feel you.
[199:35.67]There's been robbers.
[199:37.29]People stealing my money and shit.
[199:38.55]Who knows?
[199:38.94]She probably could have been an evil person.
[199:41.98]Catch me a squid.
[199:46.34]Okay.
[199:47.52]The ocean at night.
[199:49.30]You got it.
[199:50.44]I'm gonna get some bait.
[199:52.81]I'll do that tonight.
[199:58.39]Can I make better bait?
[199:59.37]I think I can, can't I?
[200:05.98]Hmm.
[200:06.84]I'll just buy it.
[200:20.42]I will just buy the bait.
[200:27.00]Hopefully...
[200:31.06]This jerky boy has finished my pickaxe.
[200:42.14]Wrong house.
[200:48.55]I can just do this.
[200:49.15]I love when it snows in games.
[200:52.57]Something real cozy about snow coming down.
[200:58.49]Especially pixelated snow.
[201:02.36]You know, it's because you can enjoy it without having to worry about it.
[201:08.58]Snow is a pain in the ass.
[201:11.00]Snow is here all the time.
[201:12.62]In the wintertime we get a shitload of snow.
[201:14.55]In like the Boston area.
[201:23.63]But it's still cool.
[201:28.00]New record.
[201:44.15]After this fish, it should be open.
[201:46.94]I'm waiting.
[201:47.30]I was anticipating him to jump up like he always does.
[201:51.10]He's erratic fish.
[201:58.79]Ah, one more.
[202:05.85]I don't know if there are any downfalls of the snow.
[202:09.35]I mean, the one major one is you can't plant really anything unless you have the special seeds for winter, right?
[202:18.15]So I've been told from the chat.
[202:32.98]Really?
[202:34.36]Really?
[202:37.53]I'm making this way more difficult than it needs to be.
[202:51.20]Oh, God.
[203:00.00]Gimme.
[203:01.20]Yes.
[203:03.80]Okay, I've got another job for you.
[203:07.78]But first... Five gold bars.
[203:16.44]Steel watering can.
[203:19.01]Let's go to the mine.
[203:26.37]My new pickaxe.
[203:36.67]Go get the jermaMoon.
[203:40.73]If it'll work.
[203:43.47]Can steel break that?
[203:45.50]I got really disappointed last time.
[203:46.82]Take it easy polar bear.
[204:03.21]Have a nice night.
[204:08.72]Have a well-rested slumber.
[204:15.75]Now what about this?
[204:16.47]Ooh, it works.
[204:19.79]It worked.
[204:20.13]It's fucking Jawa from Star Wars over here.
[204:26.83]I think I'm gonna get ready.
[204:27.75]Get my weapon.
[204:28.27]He's friendly.
[204:36.93]Good talk!
[204:38.31]I'll be seeing you.
[204:40.65]Wait, can I open your chest?
[204:42.55]Can I take your chest?
[204:43.51]Okay, bye.
[205:10.09]What about this?
[205:12.50]Still out of order.
[205:32.63]Only one swing.
[205:33.73]That's a beautiful thing.
[205:47.96]Where's the armor?
[205:52.70]Is there no armor in the game?
[205:54.20]No, there's just rings, boots, and hats.
[205:58.07]That's alright.
[206:15.90]Quartz.
[206:18.13]Don't, don't you miss picking up that Kvarts.
[206:22.96]Oh yes, Kvarts.
[206:30.02]Kvarts, I can't even do it.
[206:31.74]Kvarts.
[206:41.87]I want the gold.
[206:48.65]This is going to save a ton on energy.
[207:06.42]Two?
[207:11.20]Two Geodude Omnis.
[207:15.76]I gotta go, I keep forgetting to do that.
[207:20.09]I have, at this point, seven or eight of those.
[207:34.55]Already a way down, that's good.
[207:41.52]Another one.
[207:47.44]It's gonna be great.
[207:55.91]Second glow ring.
[207:56.63]I feel like I'm gonna supernova if I put this on.
[208:03.25]They stack?
[208:05.95]Okay.
[208:09.05]I'm extra bright now, guys.
[208:10.63]So I...
[208:26.00]I'm getting a lot more of these Geodudes.
[208:29.17]That's because of the better pickaxe.
[208:32.47]Makes sense, right?
[208:37.43]What the hell's going on?
[208:39.17]It's a long black screen.
[208:46.07]I'm also liking the fact that these ladders are just appearing now.
[208:50.37]I haven't had to go searching like I did before.
[208:51.99]I wonder why that is.
[208:53.38]Am I just getting lucky?
[209:06.16]Call back.
[209:08.28]Hello.
[209:08.86]Thank you very much.
[209:19.30]Almost at 80.
[209:19.76]I'm so excited.
[209:21.89]I can't wait to see what's after 80.
[209:22.95]Oh my goodness.
[209:31.11]I have so many.
[209:31.67]That's going to be so fun just to sit there and
[209:35.19]It is raining Funfetti Geodudes right now.
[209:40.15]It is a monsoon of Funfetti Geodudes.
[210:00.45]I have to remember that it's back up there.
[210:04.95]This is an ore I don't think I've seen.
[210:06.17]This is just amethyst.
[210:20.48]Yeah.
[210:20.96]I should eat something.
[210:21.68]I've got quite a few of these fishes to eat.
[210:30.82]What time is it?
[210:31.42]I haven't even been keeping track.
[210:32.44]Yeah, it's not that late.
[210:35.27]Only six.
[210:46.70]Firewalker boots.
[210:51.81]Ooh!
[210:54.89]Three and three.
[210:55.99]Thank you very much.
[210:56.75]This is one and two.
[210:59.77]Just a straight, pure upgrade.
[211:05.27]Very nice.
[211:07.57]This is a new area.
[211:13.20]All kinds of new deposits.
[211:21.54]I think now they're just textured differently.
[211:28.75]Watch out.
[211:31.21]We've got little mini Oogie Boogies from The Nightmare Before Christmas.
[211:37.66]Either that or burnt radish people.
[211:40.80]Whichever one you think is more of a good description.
[211:51.61]Void essence.
[212:06.56]I just tried so many times.
[212:07.78]I thought that was a... Where's he going?
[212:09.96]That guy was hiding a bomb under his shell.
[212:15.09]What time is it?
[212:35.47]Might be time to go... Yeah, I gotta catch a squid.
[212:47.12]I wanna try to get a squid.
[212:56.20]Although I don't have any bait.
[212:57.16]Give me the rabbit!
[213:05.64]Times the fishing hut closed, point nine.
[213:07.36]I gotta get rid of these scarecrows.
[213:25.45]I'm holding on to these dumb scarecrows.
[213:39.50]Alright, well, I'm going to pause for a second because I have to go to the bathroom.
[213:43.93]So I will be right back in 60 seconds.
[213:47.37]No, probably like two minutes.
[213:49.21]So get yourself a drink, a snack or something.
[213:53.16]That's what I'm going to do.
[213:54.26]I'll be right back.
[219:35.89]Hi.
[219:42.65]I got some macaroni salad.
[219:51.10]I swear to God I aged 30 years at the grocery store today.
[220:00.21]I don't even like want to eat.
[220:01.23]I don't really eat macaroni salad.
[220:05.94]But I just, for some reason, saw it behind the counter.
[220:11.52]And just pointed at it.
[220:12.30]I was like, you know what?
[220:13.58]I was getting like cheese and some deli meat and stuff like that.
[220:19.18]You know what?
[220:19.99]That macaroni salad looks real delicious right now.
[220:22.79]I'll take a half pound of that too, please.
[220:26.13]And you know, you got potato salad too.
[220:28.19]Yeah, give me some of that as well.
[220:30.51]What am I doing here?
[220:35.50]Oh, yeah, I was catching a fish.
[220:39.95]See, I told you I'm like 90 years old.
[220:45.01]I can only do this like three times.
[220:53.05]Why did you take your microphone to Niagara Falls?
[220:57.47]No, my drain pipe is right here.
[221:13.18]So when I turn my water on, anything, sink, bathroom sinks, toilets, no matter what, this is the terrain pipe.
[221:22.08]So if I... Hold on, treasure.
[221:33.39]Got it.
[221:35.48]Got it.
[221:40.32]Damn it.
[221:44.46]Ooh.
[221:46.04]Magma Geodude.
[221:48.44]Nice.
[221:56.88]I don't think this is a squid.
[221:58.82]It'd be giving me much more of a pain in the ass fight.
[222:00.60]Ooh.
[222:14.91]That could have been perfect.
[222:24.71]Magma gooey duckies.
[222:33.62]I just noticed something.
[222:36.84]I'm in a t-shirt.
[222:39.80]Isn't it really cold?
[222:40.50]Where's my jacket?
[222:42.83]It's probably freezing right now.
[222:49.19]I need one of those puffy jackets.
[222:50.45]Uh, no, there's nothing I can do.
[223:15.11]What is up?
[223:15.47]What usually is over here?
[223:19.15]Okay, no, don't explore.
[223:20.69]Go home.
[223:22.35]It's 1240.
[223:23.03]First, I gotta look in the trash.
[223:29.46]Okay.
[223:32.64]Just get a couple of old pieces of newspaper.
[223:55.79]So cool to see that this is so fresh.
[223:58.61]What is that?
[224:00.15]One little piece of fence.
[224:01.17]Are you kidding me?
[224:07.14]What are you still doing here?
[224:09.06]Do you know what time it is?
[224:11.26]Do you have any idea how late it is right now?
[224:14.38]You should not be here.
[224:16.82]Go home.
[224:20.70]Oh, fuck.
[224:47.81]Did she?
[224:49.99]Hold on.
[224:51.71]Wait a minute.
[224:53.76]Wait a second.
[224:58.76]She was standing right next to me.
[225:04.14]Let's go over this.
[225:05.99]Really quickly.
[225:06.57]We're gonna go over this.
[225:09.15]Last night a Georgia team member found you incapacitated Medical team was dispatched to bring you home safely, but glad you're okay.
[225:17.77]You've been built a thousand dollars for the service What that means?
[225:22.69]she
[225:24.13]saw me pass out over on the ground instead of just putting down her tool for a second putting me you know grabbing me underneath the shoulder and helping me into the house or even hitting me in the face once or twice to be like hey dude you're you're sleeping in the snow no she called these people to come and get me she's standing next to the house you just made me waste a thought you all you could you take a snowball and throw it in my face
[225:52.95]I'm taking that up your pay.
[225:57.73]Well, let me eat the rest of my macaroni salad.
[226:15.72]Alright, let's open it.
[226:18.92]Nope.
[226:23.24]Cannot break it.
[226:29.55]Okay.
[226:32.29]Does Jerry read the chat?
[226:35.38]No, it says feed the chat.
[226:36.30]Does Jerry feed the chat?
[226:38.08]What am I going to feed you guys?
[226:41.06]How is that going to... Go get your own macaroni salad.
[226:45.43]This is mine.
[226:50.02]All you guys had a same opportunity I had to get macaroni salad at the grocery store.
[227:04.85]Um, it's getting late.
[227:09.51]Like in real life late, not video game late.
[227:18.95]I might just call it a night.
[227:26.33]I need to get rid of these scarecrows.
[227:27.47]What does it taste like?
[227:39.10]It's got some, like, dill in here.
[227:40.22]It's a little bit on the sweet side.
[227:43.96]It's a couple of carrots.
[227:46.29]It looks to be...
[227:49.01]Maybe a little bit of relish, I think.
[227:51.49]Some cabbages.
[227:54.45]It's good.
[227:55.09]Macaroni.
[227:59.85]Alright, before I end the stream, let's crack open all the Geodudes.
[228:04.99]I'm seeing people talk about that, so yeah.
[228:06.59]I'll do that first.
[228:07.11]But yeah, it's like 2 o'clock in the morning and I need to... Hold on.
[228:19.05]Now you can dig these up, these little potholes.
[228:26.71]I'm not going to get copper right now.
[228:29.45]No way.
[228:40.72]No CS:GO cases?
[228:44.46]I have not opened one CS:GO case.
[228:48.25]I don't think in my entire life.
[228:51.73]Maybe, did I, was there a free one when you, I don't know, I don't think I, no.
[228:57.95]I want that watering can.
[229:03.57]Oh shit, he can't even do anything.
[229:08.58]Can't you take a break from what you're doing?
[229:15.60]I'm not even kidding.
[229:16.20]I'm going back to bed.
[229:17.94]I'm going back to bed.
[229:19.98]And coming back here tomorrow.
[229:20.90]I'm going to sleep for two days in a row.
[229:28.21]You want a recipe for a migraine?
[229:30.91]Go to bed.
[229:31.88]Wake up in the morning.
[229:32.84]Go back to bed.
[229:33.80]Wake up in the morning.
[229:48.09]Oh, nobody's playing with that.
[229:55.78]I could go in the cave and be useful, but I want to go to, like, real bed.
[230:03.34]So, in wintertime, nothing happens anyways.
[230:05.34]At least I don't think.
[230:07.36]Yeah, you ready for, like, a big CS:GO case unboxing?
[230:15.28]God, I'm not going to be doing that.
[230:25.01]Not only did I give you a bigger house while you were sleeping, I replaced the bed while you were asleep.
[230:33.29]Logistically, that would take like six people.
[230:37.09]Okay.
[230:38.25]You swept, what is it, like a magic trick?
[230:39.83]This is my fridge, huh?
[230:46.61]Pretty snazzy.
[230:48.71]Sashimi.
[230:51.23]Okay, what is it?
[230:51.97]Wait, that is...
[230:59.23]Make some... I just got some sashimi.
[231:04.51]Cool.
[231:08.13]Hold on, let's rearrange.
[231:09.21]This is the kitchen table.
[231:15.59]Should go in the kitchen.
[231:18.21]Down here.
[231:23.11]These furnaces can move...
[231:49.08]This is a lot nicer than the other one was.
[232:04.26]Plant's going over there.
[232:06.32]Summoning portal's going in the bedroom.
[232:09.56]Over here.
[232:13.74]dog bowl is going to go over here, I guess.
[232:23.48]I'll go right over here.
[232:25.02]Right there.
[232:27.66]TV.
[232:27.92]There we go.
[232:35.43]Plant.
[232:36.37]Next to the fridge.
[232:45.61]What the fuck are your emotes, Jerma?
[232:47.17]I really honestly can't even tell.
[232:50.21]When somebody does them, scroll over them.
[232:53.63]You'll see what they are.
[233:10.81]Perfect.
[233:13.47]Perfect.
[233:20.03]Geodudes.
[233:26.74]I want more of that macaroni salad before I go to bed.
[233:31.48]That was good.
[233:43.42]Oh, shit!
[233:47.17]I missed his birthday.
[233:51.91]Oh well, I'll dig in the trash in his honor.
[233:53.56]I don't care what Grandpa has to think.
[234:13.31]Reset.
[234:17.09]Start all over.
[234:17.89]No, he's fine.
[234:20.45]He's fine.
[234:23.60]So how many squares is this water?
[234:25.08]Is it four or five?
[234:37.55]Three?
[234:39.73]Three?
[234:45.19]I feel kind of... Wait.
[234:47.59]There we go.
[234:52.30]Five.
[234:55.09]Nice.
[234:56.33]I like it a lot.
[234:58.17]So, I have another thing for you to do.
[235:01.12]Process all these Geodudes.
[235:11.84]There you go.
[235:15.56]That was such an unenthusiastic thanks.
[235:18.41]Thanks.
[235:23.45]Who else wants a scarecrow?
[235:30.93]trash this.
[235:35.05]Where's the other trash?
[235:38.09]Okay.
[235:43.15]Here we go.
[235:45.23]Terrible.
[235:48.59]What is that?
[235:49.69]Pyrite.
[235:54.83]That is the best ore in the game, isn't it?
[236:02.04]Not a room.
[236:04.34]Who else wants a scarecrow?
[236:05.28]Is one of you guys out here?
[236:20.45]Hmm...
[236:30.60]Pyrite's very valuable.
[236:31.70]That's good to know.
[236:33.32]That's good.
[236:39.10]Gold ore.
[236:40.06]I can make one gold bar.
[236:43.59]Tulip.
[236:48.49]Coal.
[236:49.01]Always useful.
[236:54.13]Hellvite.
[236:59.48]Eh.
[237:01.96]Eh.
[237:05.76]A dead face?
[237:06.86]Dead mask?
[237:09.28]It looks like a dead mask.
[237:16.07]So inside of the frozen tier was a frozen tier.
[237:19.01]This is just a mini version of what I just broke.
[237:23.09]Okay, cool.
[237:24.63]Lots of materials.
[237:27.71]Should I donate one of these?
[237:29.67]I feel like he doesn't have one of these yet.
[237:39.67]Helvite.
[237:40.81]Yeah, I guess I'll just put it over here.
[237:44.35]Pyrite.
[237:44.77]And... Whatever this is.
[237:50.06]No reward?!
[237:50.64]I just got you three things, man.
[237:57.44]Take this, too.
[237:58.68]Can't even give it to him.
[238:08.46]Okie dokie.
[238:12.05]I have my watering can.
[238:15.35]I had the Geodudes processed.
[238:18.72]That's going to wrap it up.
[238:23.38]Oh, wait.
[238:23.64]Yeah, I forgot about Deadface.
[238:25.08]Anything else I have here?
[238:32.17]I already gave him one of these.
[238:34.63]Already gave him one of those.
[238:41.26]Okay, dead face.
[238:48.34]He'll give it to Pierre.
[238:49.20]Rub it in Pierre's face.
[238:50.34]That's scary.
[238:58.64]Wrong guy.
[238:59.06]Wait a minute.
[239:03.46]Potentially right guy.
[239:04.26]No, I don't have enough.
[239:07.28]I was going to do steel axe.
[239:16.72]What would I rate this game now that I played it for a year?
[239:18.64]Well, you know, I have 365 almost, you know, just about a full entire year's worth of time in the game.
[239:28.01]It's fun.
[239:29.17]Recommend.
[239:35.45]Still no reward.
[239:37.97]Did you run out of stuff to give people?
[239:40.53]It's a winter time, man.
[239:41.91]I need some help.
[239:52.09]Comes another train, which I still don't know what that means.
[239:58.14]If it wasn't that important, why would they do a heads-up display notification?
[240:06.42]Two catfish.
[240:09.14]Seems like a lot of money for two catfish.
[240:11.39]And I can keep them?
[240:12.97]Is that what it said?
[240:18.86]Alright, guys.
[240:20.38]That is going to wrap it up.
[240:22.38]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[240:24.76]I appreciate it.
[240:26.80]Much love.
[240:27.36]Much respect.
[240:29.67]I'm not sure what I'm doing tomorrow.
[240:31.31]I may or may not be streaming tomorrow.
[240:32.55]I won't be streaming this late tomorrow.
[240:34.73]I would probably start a little earlier.
[240:35.87]Like, not 10 p.m., 11 p.m.
[240:39.21]Eastern.
[240:39.59]I'd probably start around, like, 6 or 7 tomorrow.
[240:43.09]And I don't know.
[240:43.65]Maybe I'll play this a little bit more.
[240:45.73]Something else, maybe.
[240:46.21]I don't know.
[240:46.53]We'll see.
[240:48.53]I do like my new house, though.
[240:49.45]It is not a total piece.
[240:50.55]Well, hold on.
[240:51.41]Extremely important.
[240:52.35]Hold on.
[240:56.45]These paintings can now be spread out.
[240:59.55]Nice.
[241:00.05]Look at that.
[241:02.73]This one has to go over here.
[241:04.99]Perfect spot.
[241:05.47]Look at that exact, like, perfect level.
[241:11.92]And this one's gonna go... Right there.
[241:19.00]Now it's a home.
[241:20.06]Before it was a house.
[241:21.52]Now it's a home.
[241:25.05]This is fine where it was.
[241:26.17]Alright.
[241:28.39]Good night, guys.
[241:29.99]I'll catch some of you guys tomorrow if you're around.
[241:31.37]I might work on a video too.
[241:33.15]I don't know.
[241:34.65]We'll see.
[241:36.28]Have a good night.
[241:37.52]Bye-bye.
[241:38.10]Ta-ta.
[241:38.94]Take care.
[241:46.62]I'm going to get some more macaroni salad.
[241:49.76]Come on, Otto.
[241:50.18]Let's go.
[241:51.13]Otto.
