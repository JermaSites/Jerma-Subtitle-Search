[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.61]Hey.
[00:03.33]How you doing, everybody?
[00:07.82]Welcome to another day.
[00:08.78]I streamed yesterday, but I had to kind of take a little short there.
[00:15.30]Cut it a little short.
[00:16.38]Because I wasn't feeling well and I have a cough.
[00:19.29]It's a deep cough.
[00:20.39]It's inside.
[00:22.59]My body.
[00:24.39]Like it would be coming from somewhere else.
[00:26.75]Outside.
[00:27.09]It's an outside cough.
[00:28.21]Yeah.
[00:29.66]Uh, it hasn't gotten better.
[00:31.12]It's actually gotten a little worse.
[00:34.87]And, uh, that's the unfortunate thing.
[00:38.13]I woke up this morning.
[00:40.21]I was a little slow.
[00:41.31]I'm a little fatigued.
[00:45.00]But I don't give a shit.
[00:47.38]Because Sekiro came up.
[00:49.68]And I've been waiting for this game for a long time.
[00:52.72]So I don't care how bad I'm gonna be coughing, I'm gonna be mutin'.
[00:57.10]I'm playing this fucking game now, because... Come on.
[01:01.42]What am I gonna... I'll wait like a few days.
[01:03.60]No, no, no.
[01:09.96]Yeah, there's mucus, but it's fine.
[01:16.37]Oh, the Drake no, no, no face.
[01:21.26]But yeah, we're gonna start Sekiro.
[01:24.14]I'm going in completely blind like we did Dark Souls 3.
[01:29.43]We'll see how we do.
[01:30.49]I've heard it's a lot different.
[01:32.65]I've heard that the game should not be played even remotely like a Dark Souls game.
[01:40.87]It emphasizes blocking and parries, not dodge rolling.
[01:46.63]So I'm looking forward to this.
[01:53.55]Early boy.
[01:54.13]Yeah, we're a little, we are.
[01:55.11]That wasn't feeling great and I didn't want to just let it progress even more over the next three or four hours.
[02:02.07]I took some Dayquil.
[02:09.09]Go back to bed?
[02:09.87]No!
[02:11.97]I'm staying right here.
[02:14.13]It's Christmas morning for somebody that likes the game company FromSoftware.
[02:20.01]Christmas only comes once every four years with this company.
[02:24.69]When was Dark Souls 3?
[02:26.39]2015?
[02:26.41]2016?
[02:26.67]17?
[02:27.05]18?
[02:27.07]9?
[02:27.51]Alright, so Christmas comes once every three years.
[02:30.15]Thanks for the early stream.
[02:44.52]Yeah.
[02:49.04]How long do you think I'm gonna be streaming today?
[02:50.70]I don't know.
[02:52.58]It really depends on a couple of factors.
[02:55.58]It depends on, first of all, how physically do I feel, and if I get stuck on the tutorial boss for the first, like, four hours.
[03:04.45]I don't know.
[03:07.13]I've been playing it since release, and it might be too hard.
[03:12.02]That's what I keep hearing.
[03:13.02]I keep hearing the game is too hard.
[03:18.22]I can't wait.
[03:26.11]Your immune system is compromised because you're a vegan.
[03:33.07]I had a chicken sandwich last night.
[03:36.91]Just for the record, you know.
[03:42.19]And there it is.
[03:43.81]God, I'm so excited for this.
[03:45.31]I wish I felt better.
[03:46.59]I wish I physically didn't feel so fucking awful.
[03:49.61]But it doesn't matter.
[03:50.27]Everything's gonna be fine.
[03:51.42]I'm gonna get the video game placebo effect and I'm gonna start feeling way better in about 10 seconds.
[04:01.60]This is Sekiro Shadows Die Twice.
[04:05.50]Not like you haven't seen this intro like 50 times.
[04:09.24]I'm one of like 16,000 people streaming this game right now.
[04:15.49]I was actually going to title... We were talking in the pre-stream chat.
[04:17.63]I was going to title this stream in all capitals.
[04:20.29]Please click mine.
[04:21.39]Don't scroll down.
[04:22.26]Click mine.
[04:23.04]I play Dark Souls.
[04:24.96]I actually play Dark Souls.
[04:28.30]It's going to be in all capitals.
[04:37.12]I actually changed... I went in here and I changed... I'm curious as to how this is going to play out because for two reasons, right?
[04:43.16]I got an Xbox One controller plugged in.
[04:46.48]And I don't like the bumpers on the Xbox controller.
[04:51.88]So what I did is I changed attack to right trigger.
[04:55.01]And prosthetic tool to right bumper.
[04:58.03]And guard to left trigger.
[04:59.57]I wonder if that's going to be bad or not.
[05:05.09]I'm actually considering making Attack X. I'm thinking about it.
[05:19.88]You can use PS4 controllers?
[05:21.42]Yeah, but I heard there was issues with it.
[05:24.18]And the button prompts screw me up too, because the button prompts don't change to PS4.
[05:31.50]Yeah, we'll try.
[05:32.02]I'm just gonna play like this.
[05:33.66]And see how it is.
[05:34.58]If I need to change it, I'll change it, right?
[05:38.56]I'm stalling, I know.
[05:39.70]That top right.
[05:40.40]Did you see that auto-save top right thing?
[05:42.94]It's been so long since I've seen that.
[05:47.26]Set it to English.
[05:47.94]Yeah, it's on English already.
[05:50.50]Alright, here we go.
[05:52.54]It's been so long since I've played a... software... a piece of software developed by FromSoftware.
[06:02.81]Blood on.
[06:03.43]Subtitles on.
[06:04.25]HUD.
[06:05.54]This is all fine.
[06:07.30]This audio, I think, is at a decent level.
[06:11.82]Software from FromSoftware.
[06:13.56]Yes.
[06:15.54]The game is meant to be played in Japanese.
[06:18.74]We'll just go back and forth.
[06:19.79]Every, like, five minutes, I'll switch it.
[06:25.47]Alright.
[06:25.73]It comes with the opening cutscene.
[06:37.52]In the closing years of the Sengoku era, Japan was consumed by a perpetual conflict.
[06:44.42]Takes place in Japan?
[06:45.75]The fires of war raged on, spreading deep into the mountains, to the land of Ashina.
[07:07.10]Ooh, nice shot.
[07:11.80]Was that bad or good?
[07:13.65]That guy has a Jerm on his hair.
[07:22.07]Ugh, I gotta get comfortable.
[07:31.64]This game's supposed to be the hardest game ever made.
[07:39.97]What is the hardest game?
[07:40.90]Oh, my God, shut up.
[07:41.88]No, no, not you, me.
[07:43.02]General Tamura is no more!
[08:03.53]Then Master Swordsman Isshin Ashina staged a bloody coup and wrested control of the land.
[08:29.08]What the?
[08:29.60]What?
[08:31.42]What's the matter, Stray?
[08:33.62]Nothing left to lose?
[08:38.62]Well, would you look at that?
[08:40.00]Don't grab it by that.
[08:41.02]Fascinating.
[08:42.82]Will you join me, starving wolf?
[08:44.77]Don't you understand?
[08:45.25]You've got to hand somebody a pair of scissors the other way.
[08:48.17]On their death, a young man was taken from the battlefield.
[08:52.81]He trained relentlessly.
[08:54.33]It's like Kindergarten Safety 101.
[08:56.07]Went on to become a master shinobi.
[09:00.02]Listen, Wolf.
[09:01.36]You must never forget the Shinobi Code.
[09:05.82]As your father, my word is absolute.
[09:08.74]Your master's is a close second.
[09:13.13]As of today, he is your master.
[09:18.57]Defend him with your life.
[09:20.54]If he is taken, bring him back at any cost.
[09:35.53]I'm sweating right now.
[09:36.73]I really am.
[09:38.99]I'm disgusting.
[09:40.65]I don't know if that's because I might have a fever.
[09:42.49]I don't know.
[09:43.85]I'm gonna say it's because I'm really excited for Sekiro Shadows Done Twice.
[09:47.68]After Isshin's coup, the Ashina clan was on the brink of collapse.
[09:56.74]and the shinobi known as wolf had lost everything everything both the man who took him in and the boy he had sworn to protect there's that engine is that from so I haven't seen any gameplay
[10:19.61]I've been pretty good about keeping away from it.
[10:21.97]I've seen like, maybe, I saw, I think I saw like the original teaser trailer, but not any, hey, there's ten straight minutes of gameplay.
[10:31.75]This could be a strategy game, or a puzzle game, and I wouldn't even know.
[10:36.67]Shinobi.
[10:40.17]Open your eyes.
[10:44.09]For the sake of your master.
[10:51.47]Every minute is at least as hard as pinwheel.
[10:54.23]Good luck.
[10:55.35]Okay.
[10:57.97]That's good to know.
[10:59.23]Thanks for the tip.
[11:13.91]Nice, alright.
[11:14.97]Here we go.
[11:16.44]Let's begin.
[11:17.92]Let's check the movement first, that's really important.
[11:20.78]And the show is live!
[11:32.16]Is that the... Oh, it's the dodge roll!
[11:34.72]Nice!
[11:36.78]Yeah, everyone said the game was way harder, but the funny thing is, this is like, this is 400 dodge frames.
[11:47.80]Where is the dodge?
[11:51.36]Alright.
[11:52.04]Don't miss anything, okay?
[11:54.20]I'm gonna pay close attention.
[11:55.66]Even without a blade, you can reach it, stay silent, stay vigilant.
[12:00.73]So, escape the well.
[12:18.79]Okay.
[12:24.63]First thing, you can swim in this game.
[12:27.75]I didn't just fall straight through out of the map.
[12:33.33]Interesting.
[12:36.34]That's new.
[12:39.78]So I can go this way or that way.
[12:41.22]Can I dive?
[12:41.80]I wonder if there's a dive button.
[12:52.11]What's over here?
[12:52.75]I gotta turn the lights off in my room.
[12:57.14]That's important.
[12:57.80]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[12:58.50]I'm in the menu now.
[13:08.32]Hold on.
[13:09.30]It's 1.30 in the afternoon, but the lights are coming off.
[13:12.68]This game has actual menus, apparently.
[13:16.70]There we go.
[13:17.15]Now I can see a little bit better.
[13:20.71]The equipment menu allows you to change your currently equipped quick items.
[13:25.09]There are five slots available to equip and switch out quick items as needed, right?
[13:28.82]Okay.
[13:29.78]So it's just like Dark Souls.
[13:31.00]You have this.
[13:32.66]These are your inventory slots or equipment slots.
[13:37.70]Interesting.
[13:38.14]Alright.
[13:38.54]Unseen aid, vitality, attack power.
[13:41.08]We only got two stats in this whole game.
[13:44.18]Vitality and attack power.
[13:47.69]Items currently in possession can be viewed through the inventory menu.
[13:52.94]Okay, so this is my items.
[13:55.42]There's the idol.
[13:56.16]I'm going to read.
[13:56.88]Okay, let's see.
[14:02.60]No, no, no, don't touch that.
[14:04.52]A small palm-sized wooden Buddha can be used repeatedly.
[14:08.72]Held by the wolf ever since he was saved by his father, its corners are rounded with use.
[14:12.72]This Buddha is used to return home.
[14:15.02]It will return the user to the last visited sculptor's idol or dilapidated temple.
[14:20.75]And I can use this as many times as I want.
[14:24.15]So this is a Homeward Bone with an infinite value.
[14:31.80]Really.
[14:34.92]Unlimited Bone, yeah.
[14:38.26]Okay.
[14:38.60]Alright, so.
[14:42.82]Am I missing something over here?
[14:48.28]You can wall jump?
[14:54.13]No, nothing here.
[14:54.75]Maybe there is something, like, over here eventually.
[15:02.36]Is this just like Mario 64?
[15:03.36]It was made by, I think, the same exact developer.
[15:09.33]From Nintendo.
[15:12.05]I know that was not funny.
[15:13.23]But, you know, look, I'm sick today.
[15:16.89]That is really cool, though.
[15:19.46]Just having a jump in general that I don't have to be sprinting and then press, like, the left thumbstick in.
[15:26.64]What?
[15:27.26]Okay.
[15:30.38]Yeah, well, that's jump.
[15:34.88]In air near to do a wall jump.
[15:37.84]Don't even tell me that you can even feel like Spider-Man in this game.
[15:41.67]No.
[15:43.21]I mean, yeah, kind of.
[15:46.11]Oh, I just want to go so slow.
[15:48.07]I'm sorry if you thought this was going to be like a fast playthrough of a guy.
[15:51.01]Like, yeah, let me just get to like the first boss now.
[15:53.53]No, no, no.
[15:56.32]I just want to look at everything.
[15:57.48]I want to experience the game very slowly.
[16:04.00]What if I just died?
[16:05.62]Thank God there's no fall damage.
[16:07.38]Otherwise, that would have been death number one.
[16:13.83]I need a weapon.
[16:16.31]Also, another thing that I need to change... I need to change the... No, maybe not.
[16:23.24]I'll get used to it.
[16:24.76]Alright, we can go backwards, or we can go... Alright, I gotta, like, relax.
[16:32.91]I haven't even played the game yet.
[16:34.01]Let's go this way first.
[16:35.05]No.
[16:36.65]Holy shit.
[16:42.44]Hug wall.
[16:44.14]You toggle it.
[16:45.00]Okay, I can go the other way!
[16:46.16]This is a shimmy.
[16:52.74]Uh, you can peek around a corner.
[16:56.42]Oh, there's an enemy right there.
[17:00.88]Stealth.
[17:04.36]Stealth?
[17:05.06]Advance without being seen by crouching in bushes or moving under floors.
[17:11.33]You do not have a sword at the moment.
[17:13.07]Use stealth to avoid enemies and head to the Moonview Tower.
[17:16.91]You are about to be seen.
[17:18.33]Warning markers appear above enemies' heads.
[17:20.43]Oh man, this is a stealth game?
[17:22.47]So, okay, crouch.
[17:26.05]Oh, you can see me?
[17:26.73]I'm in a bush.
[17:41.56]Okay, let's just keep going.
[17:44.84]Let's hang off the ledge.
[17:50.04]It just feels like I shouldn't be able to do this.
[17:59.14]Drop down.
[18:00.38]No, that's gonna kill me.
[18:11.83]Let's go through the corn.
[18:14.41]Underfloor.
[18:14.99]Wolf can slip into tight spaces such as beneath floors when crouched.
[18:18.71]You can go beneath floors.
[18:27.21]Like under there.
[18:28.15]Okay.
[18:29.71]But what if I'm missing items?
[18:31.85]There's probably like an item I can go get over here.
[18:37.76]Did I just do it?
[18:39.74]The moonlight shines strongly on the Moonview Tower tonight.
[18:43.10]The Divine Heir is probably using the light for his reading again.
[18:46.58]Probably.
[18:47.12]But imprisoning a mere child.
[18:49.89]I feel sorry for the boy.
[18:51.65]Agree either.
[18:53.37]But I'm sure Lord Ganondorf will help his reasons.
[19:00.38]Well, let me see.
[19:01.02]Because that's... Is there something else I can do?
[19:08.58]I mean, that's clearly going under the floor, but... Is there anything else I can do?
[19:12.62]There's so many hidden fucking things in this game.
[19:20.28]No, I'm just gonna go.
[19:38.79]I tried to do the infinite I-frame dodge.
[19:46.61]Died in the... Well, I'm just... I'm so concerned about missing something.
[19:51.46]I'm just gonna go.
[19:54.00]Yeah, I'm just gonna go.
[19:55.24]Look, there's like an item over there.
[19:56.66]Ugh.
[19:58.54]I'm gonna go back.
[20:06.76]Wait, am I never going to be able to come back here again?
[20:08.18]Are you sure?
[20:08.75]I figured this might have been a different way to go.
[20:18.17]But, maybe not.
[20:23.34]There's nothing here.
[20:26.66]Alright, that's... I'm going to call that strike one.
[20:34.95]Jack has three strikes today.
[20:53.53]That was one guy.
[20:54.49]No, I'm just going to go.
[20:59.66]I'm just so happy that I get to play this right now.
[21:05.88]Under tight spaces.
[21:07.42]That death doesn't count.
[21:10.60]Alright, I got the eave drop there.
[21:12.59]Spider webs.
[21:13.29]Let's just go.
[21:17.75]So I'm assuming that's the tower, right?
[21:21.54]How much can I move without actually being seen, I wonder?
[21:27.24]It's yellow and then it turns red, right?
[21:29.18]What about over here?
[21:33.38]No.
[21:35.70]Let's listen.
[21:36.16]Hole in the wall.
[21:38.70]No one could pass.
[21:51.47]No, really.
[21:53.05]But you're not Sekiro.
[21:54.95]I'm Sekiro.
[21:55.75]I can do it easily.
[21:58.69]Alright, so now... They've got two... Can I go down here?
[22:03.75]Can I just drop down there?
[22:08.82]I mean, obviously I have to go down there.
[22:15.70]I wonder how sensitive their hearing is.
[22:27.39]That's beautiful.
[22:29.35]Oh.
[22:30.33]Imagine living there.
[22:34.77]Jeremy never played a video game in his life.
[22:37.33]Elbertson.
[22:38.25]No, I just don't know.
[22:39.44]In some stealth games, it's very sensitive.
[22:41.14]They're hearing, or how close you get, or... Alright, I can jump this.
[22:46.34]I would have been very embarrassed if I had died right there.
[22:51.98]Uh, jump and in the air to ledge hang.
[22:54.46]Jump, ledge hang.
[23:00.88]Is there a sprint?
[23:09.56]Okay, hold on.
[23:10.24]There's a hole in the wall up here.
[23:11.78]Well, there is.
[23:12.30]Nothing else?
[23:14.08]What about a guy up there?
[23:16.22]I don't see nothing.
[23:21.28]What about down here?
[23:23.72]Nothing.
[23:24.04]No items.
[23:29.25]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[23:29.93]What does that mean?
[23:32.11]Not sturdy.
[23:38.11]There's the hole facing the cliff.
[23:39.57]Alright.
[23:39.83]I think we found our first character of the game.
[23:44.93]Is this gonna alert enemies or something?
[23:46.65]No.
[24:00.22]first boss hey no spoilers that's strike two it's been too long wolf even if it's incorrect I've come to free you my lord well then raise your head
[24:32.80]He just fucking flops me.
[24:35.20]Oh, that's a sword.
[24:36.46]Okay.
[24:37.04]I thought it was a pipe.
[24:45.24]I hereby welcome you to Sekiro.
[24:53.98]Thanks for dying in the tutorial.
[24:57.07]But I was exploring the controls.
[24:58.39]That doesn't count.
[24:59.47]As you command.
[25:08.42]The Kusa Bimaru.
[25:11.22]A katana given by Kuro, the divine heir and heirloom of the Hirata family.
[25:16.62]A cadet branch descended from Ashina.
[25:22.01]Once thought lost, it has found its way back into the hands of the wolf.
[25:25.67]The name Kusa Bimaru beseeches a shinobi's role as to kill, but even a shinobi must not forget mercy.
[25:32.85]A mantra of the blade itself may manifest.
[25:36.93]Alright.
[25:39.31]Weapon.
[25:42.17]Alright, so this is the hub world.
[25:44.33]This is where I level up my souls.
[25:45.99]Do you get an Estus in this game?
[25:49.05]Okay, healing gourd.
[26:01.18]A gourd filled with vitality restoring medicine.
[26:03.52]Restoring, resting, refills the gourd.
[26:05.74]Okay.
[26:06.94]Made by an apprentice of the extraordinary Dr. Dogen.
[26:11.20]Though it is strange that the gourd's medicinal waters refill automatically.
[26:15.38]The seeds within may hold the secret to how it works.
[26:17.79]I gotta turn my mouse upside down.
[26:20.31]Because it's gonna keep doing that.
[26:21.53]I'm gonna like put it on my desk and like upside down.
[26:24.97]Okay, so I have a Estus kind of.
[26:27.25]Were you gravely injured?
[26:30.05]Afterward?
[26:31.83]Do you not remember that night?
[26:34.02]I do not.
[26:35.22]I'm not going to change the audio to Spanish.
[26:36.86]We'll talk about it later.
[26:38.22]Right now, we must escape Ashina Castle.
[26:40.90]As you say.
[26:41.44]We've got an escort mission.
[26:42.20]There's a secret passage beneath the moat bridge that will take us out of the castle.
[26:46.48]Beneath the moat bridge?
[26:47.10]Lord Isshin told me about it once.
[26:48.78]I ask you to find that secret passage.
[26:51.28]Okay.
[26:51.82]Once you find it, signal me with a reed whistle.
[26:56.28]You got one of those?
[26:56.90]Like you used to long ago.
[26:58.54]I will join you as soon as I hear it.
[27:02.80]Alright, healing, using quick, you can cycle through various quick items and use each according to the situation, right?
[27:08.91]If you've taken damage, you can recover vitality with healing gourd.
[27:11.51]So use quick item and then cycle, wait, so the use item is now up.
[27:17.07]Ooh.
[27:20.89]Okay, I gotta actually put it on here though.
[27:26.80]Oh boy.
[27:29.60]I gotta change that.
[27:34.90]Yeah, that's going to screw with me the whole game.
[27:39.42]Let's go into binding here.
[27:44.18]So let's see.
[27:47.08]Action is... This is action.
[27:53.36]There's a lot of... Okay, use item X. Is Y bound to anything?
[27:58.74]Cycle prosthetic tool.
[28:01.31]Shit.
[28:02.11]I might have to get used to that.
[28:07.09]Because drinking like the Estus is always that face button, whether it's square or X to me.
[28:21.82]Somebody said rebind Y to up.
[28:25.82]Because that's a cycle prosthetic tool that's probably better than Y, I would think.
[28:31.23]Use item, I'm going to say X. And then action and collect loot, I'm going to do Y.
[28:43.51]Because I will never, ever get used to that.
[28:46.15]My muscle memory, my brain... Has different bindings because of it.
[28:53.39]Yeah, but it doesn't matter.
[28:55.31]It really doesn't matter.
[28:56.09]Hitting X to heal is something I will never be able to not do.
[29:01.73]So then Y is now my interaction button.
[29:04.15]Which, that's fine.
[29:04.85]That's getting the car in GTA.
[29:06.53]Right?
[29:06.79]That's interact.
[29:08.13]I can do that.
[29:11.45]There's a secret passage beneath the moat bridge that can take us out of the castle.
[29:15.89]Find the secret passage beneath the moat bridge so that we may escape Ashina Castle.
[29:21.37]When you've reached it, give the signal.
[29:23.31]I'll come as soon as I hear the good whistle.
[29:25.14]So let's... How do I refill the gourd?
[29:29.34]Didn't tell me that one.
[29:31.46]Smartass.
[29:32.28]Alright, let's go upstairs.
[29:36.08]Nice physics.
[29:36.68]Look at that item.
[29:41.67]Pellet.
[29:42.11]Medicinal pellets that slowly restore vitality.
[29:45.19]A secret treatment passed down for generations in these lands.
[29:47.85]Records say it has been used in battle since times long gone and lent to the famed resilience of Ashina warriors.
[29:55.20]A pill case full of these pellets would also serve as a battle charm.
[30:01.88]Oops, I just broke it.
[30:04.24]Okay, one pellet.
[30:07.07]Is this a chest?
[30:09.45]Let me look at that again.
[30:10.33]So, pellet.
[30:13.93]Slowly restore vitality?
[30:17.51]Vitality is a stat.
[30:20.81]Huh.
[30:22.57]Okay.
[30:24.61]So, but vitality is... Vitality is not health.
[30:31.94]No, it is health.
[30:41.40]Okay.
[30:42.08]Alright.
[30:42.86]Okay.
[30:45.43]I'm thinking too hard about it.
[30:46.85]Well, I'm just basing all my knowledge on FromSoftware.
[30:54.05]I thought maybe it was something to help with, like a status effect or something.
[30:57.28]Alright, let's go.
[31:04.52]And here we go.
[31:04.98]I just opened up the gates to Yharnam.
[31:08.70]Posture and Deathblows.
[31:09.59]A Shinobi aims to break an opponent's posture.
[31:12.53]Attacking an enemy is one way to achieve this.
[31:15.81]When an enemy's posture breaks, he is vulnerable to a shinobi deathblow.
[31:21.82]So right trigger is a... I mapped it to that.
[31:24.90]Right trigger after breaking posture is a deathblow.
[31:27.14]So that's kind of like a parry into a deathblow or a visceral attack.
[31:33.55]More towards Bloodborne, I would say.
[31:37.21]So breaking an opponent's posture...
[31:42.50]Here we go.
[31:42.90]First enemy!
[31:44.00]Is there a two-handed, or is it only one-handed?
[31:46.12]How does this work?
[31:50.67]Let's see what happens.
[31:51.49]Do I have to dodge?
[31:52.35]Okay.
[31:55.57]Oh, I got two people at the same time.
[31:56.87]Let's go!
[31:57.47]Let's go!
[32:06.40]Oh, that's posture, right?
[32:07.74]Okay.
[32:14.65]Oh, I see!
[32:15.15]That's a different bar!
[32:16.21]And it's a separate bar underneath the health.
[32:21.67]Whoa, alright.
[32:26.45]Well... Uh... Okay, so... There's two bar... There's a health bar and then a posture bar.
[32:32.46]Does stamina exist anymore?
[32:35.02]Wait a minute.
[32:39.12]There's no stamina!
[32:44.89]Holy shit.
[32:47.53]That changes everything.
[32:48.33]Let me go take nothing else over there, right?
[33:00.40]Wow, alright.
[33:02.28]That's so cool.
[33:08.04]Oh my god, yes!
[33:09.26]Alright, let's go, come here!
[33:17.01]Sometimes relentless attack is not enough to break an enemy's posture.
[33:20.98]Deflecting enemy attacks is another way to damage their posture.
[33:25.24]A master shinobi uses a combination of deflect and attack to achieve swift victory.
[33:30.82]Left trigger the moment an attack lands is deflect.
[33:36.30]Let's give it a try.
[33:38.29]Let me see what it looks like.
[33:38.97]Okay.
[33:42.71]There it is.
[33:43.05]So then you go immediately into it.
[33:45.69]So it's not as much a parry as it is... Ooh, okay.
[33:49.13]Nope, I get it.
[33:54.20]So you get to treat it as a... That actually feels really good, actually.
[33:59.70]That feels fucking great.
[34:03.02]I'm not gonna lie.
[34:03.58]Alright, two guys that way.
[34:08.45]Let's go up here.
[34:14.84]Anything hidden?
[34:17.23]No, that's just where I came from.
[34:18.23]Like I said, I think I have to go that way.
[34:24.33]Lock on?
[34:24.85]Yeah, by locking on targets.
[34:25.91]Yeah, while locked on you can change with R. It's much easier to attack and deflect and perform other combat actions with people that are in front of you.
[34:32.88]Alright, I guess I'm just going to go in that door.
[34:44.74]Let's see if I can get some perfect lock-ons here.
[34:46.60]Perfect parries.
[34:48.10]Okay, there's that.
[34:52.66]So what is that?
[34:54.18]I got one of those bars, too.
[35:02.94]Perfect lock-on.
[35:07.42]So I... This is on PC.
[35:09.78]PC with an Xbox One controller.
[35:12.80]Is there a sprint...
[35:23.74]Oh, you can instantly kill people!
[35:25.18]You just insta-kill!
[35:26.08]Oh!
[35:36.29]Where is he?
[35:38.47]This is leader, leader!
[35:40.75]What?
[35:42.27]Is this a boss already?
[35:45.19]A counter-slash can be performed immediately after deflecting.
[35:47.82]Yeah, that's what I was doing.
[35:49.18]This allows you to deal posture damage without giving the enemy time to recover.
[35:54.54]Counter slash.
[36:04.76]So it is just swordplay, huh?
[36:09.89]Let's see if I can... He's got a big, long swing.
[36:18.85]So that's his posture up there.
[36:22.66]Get out of here.
[36:24.52]You're done.
[36:30.22]Some powerful opponents require multiple deathblows to be killed.
[36:34.81]The number of deathblows required to kill an enemy is shown by the red circular markers above their vitality bar.
[36:41.57]So, you gotta do a deathblow to kill bosses.
[36:46.12]Got it.
[36:47.89]Ooh, that hurt.
[36:50.73]Watch my posture.
[36:55.59]That hurt.
[37:17.54]Back it up, back it up, back it up.
[37:18.40]I don't want to break.
[37:21.44]Whoa, my posture just got increased by a shitload right there.
[37:36.51]So if I hold down block, my posture goes back to normal.
[37:39.53]Okay.
[37:40.68]Whoa!
[37:51.93]Oh, he's gonna break my posture, shit!
[37:53.71]Okay.
[37:57.54]Who's gonna break first?
[38:03.78]You.
[38:08.10]Oh no!
[38:08.94]Oh no, he's almost broken.
[38:12.26]Oh!
[38:12.64]Don't treat it like Dark Souls!
[38:33.04]Wow, that's different.
[38:34.80]That's very different.
[38:42.38]So, alright.
[38:46.74]If your posture breaks, then you can die.
[38:56.51]But you could break their posture as well.
[38:58.58]Alright, I'm starting to understand how this works.
[39:13.21]Well, I'm already right there.
[39:16.79]Is there stagger?
[39:17.65]I want to help pick up the stagger.
[39:20.13]But I don't lose posture when I attack.
[39:34.65]Alright, I see.
[39:35.65]I kick.
[39:36.15]Because you can do that little block at any time.
[39:38.07]I'm using it as... I gotta remove the Dark Souls from my brain because a parry in Dark Souls takes a few seconds.
[39:46.36]You know what I mean?
[39:46.84]Do it again.
[40:05.17]Am I dead?
[40:06.79]What?
[40:12.25]I'm going down again?
[40:16.72]Okay.
[40:17.50]I'm starting to figure out what I'm doing here.
[40:24.34]So once he gets to that red area, you gotta hit him another couple times.
[40:27.58]So here's another pellet.
[40:31.23]Okay.
[40:33.27]Interesting, interesting, interesting stuff.
[40:37.07]Uh, I'm not gonna heal yet.
[40:40.97]Wait, what else is over here?
[40:46.10]You're gonna say that 20 times an hour for the next three days.
[40:50.50]You know, it's Andrew, I'm starting to figure it out.
[40:52.36]You know, I've got first boss down.
[40:55.34]You know, I'm starting to figure it out.
[40:56.68]Interesting.
[40:57.30]The mechanics are pretty cool.
[40:58.89]I'm just starting to figure out, like, kind of how that works.
[41:02.25]Three bosses down.
[41:03.89]Cool mechanic, but I'm not sure I completely understand it yet.
[41:07.93]It's very fun, though.
[41:11.47]45 minutes from completing the game.
[41:14.61]Yeah, I think I'm really comfortable getting comfortable now.
[41:16.91]Maybe on a second playthrough, I feel like I can do something here.
[41:26.36]No, it's... It's offense and defense at the same time.
[41:32.25]Which is something that you're not used to, you know?
[41:35.30]Ash gripped into a hardened clump.
[41:36.74]Throw it at an enemy to temporarily distract them.
[41:42.94]The snow falls thick and thus the hearth runs thick with ash.
[41:45.72]So you can throw dust in somebody's eyes?
[41:47.70]Alright.
[41:53.21]What else we got here?
[41:54.01]This... I can go down.
[41:56.25]Should I go in?
[42:04.11]Oops.
[42:06.21]What about the doors that were just over here?
[42:09.25]Let me go in the doors.
[42:15.48]Can I open this, or can it not be opened?
[42:16.82]Like, ah, it doesn't... Ah, here we go.
[42:19.52]Cannot open from this side.
[42:21.89]You know what that means.
[42:24.69]That means fall down here.
[42:27.21]And... No, does it?
[42:29.37]I almost did that.
[42:30.25]You almost just left.
[42:34.11]Alright, I'm gonna go up there, actually.
[42:35.67]Under the bridge, right?
[42:36.77]That's the bridge.
[42:43.86]Let's see what's over this way.
[42:46.98]Should I be stealthing?
[42:51.34]In air, near wall, wall jump, and then hang on ledge.
[42:54.04]Yeah.
[43:00.15]What's that?
[43:03.54]Oh, I can e-tron.
[43:04.06]So it's guarded now.
[43:04.88]What is that thing?
[43:05.60]What is this little weirdo that's just sitting here digging?
[43:09.42]Uh...
[43:35.30]It's an enemy.
[43:36.80]What do I do about this?
[43:45.10]What the fuck?
[43:45.98]Okay.
[43:52.13]Near edge.
[43:56.03]Um... Who was that?
[44:01.13]I don't know who that person even was, or why they were here.
[44:08.65]egg.
[44:10.09]Can I climb?
[44:13.27]Is this gonna kill me?
[44:16.49]Oh, an item!
[44:16.97]Look!
[44:20.29]Oh, look at that.
[44:21.21]What is it?
[44:22.53]Pellets.
[44:24.07]I should probably put these on the hotbar.
[44:25.05]Uh, and the ash here too.
[44:31.19]So, pellets, heal, alright.
[44:35.60]Oh, you got more rocks.
[44:39.68]Let me just take a gander across the way, make sure I didn't miss anything.
[44:43.28]I mean, there's shit over there, but... you know, fuck it.
[44:50.67]Let's just go the way we were going.
[44:59.63]Uh, any enemies?
[45:06.63]There's gonna be something down here, right?
[45:07.81]Like, right here.
[45:10.15]No?
[45:14.42]What is this?
[45:17.24]Nothing?
[45:20.04]This appears to be the escape route.
[45:22.42]Call the Divine Heir with the... No!
[45:24.75]I found it!
[45:25.17]Okay, hold on.
[45:25.65]No, no, no, not yet.
[45:26.39]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[45:27.01]Is there something else I can grab or do?
[45:31.27]Is this death if I fall down this?
[45:36.48]Hold on.
[45:43.74]You can't grab that?
[45:44.46]Alright, well, can I... Hopefully I can grab this again.
[45:55.25]I need to know.
[45:57.97]Oh, it's not water.
[46:06.72]What the fuck is that?
[46:07.44]Okay.
[46:07.92]It's just a lizard.
[46:13.63]Oh my god.
[46:14.55]I don't even know if that was hostile.
[46:17.25]I don't even know if that enemy was hostile.
[46:20.65]I'm sorry.
[46:21.09]I'm coughing.
[46:33.24]Anything else?
[46:33.72]Okay.
[46:38.44]Yeah, I'm... I don't think I... I don't need to be doing that.
[46:43.05]But I don't want to just blow through that part.
[46:46.61]Let me look up here.
[46:47.21]I feel like there's probably another pellet or something.
[46:51.05]Maybe.
[46:52.77]Maybe not.
[47:01.14]No.
[47:03.36]No.
[47:05.18]I can go here.
[47:13.64]Nothing else, right?
[47:15.60]No, not really.
[47:18.60]Just want to look.
[47:38.25]No, I think we're good.
[47:39.03]I think we're good to go.
[47:42.59]Nothing else over here.
[47:44.00]That much of a fall might kill you.
[47:57.21]Still in the canyon?
[47:58.07]Oh, I'm taking my sweet ass time.
[47:59.95]You better believe it.
[48:04.47]Although I might have to go all the way around again.
[48:12.33]Yeah.
[48:14.21]Well, at least we got to see the lizard, right?
[48:24.52]You're supposed to ride the geckos.
[48:26.74]I don't know if I believe that, but... I'm gonna go back.
[48:35.27]Jumping around is really fun, though.
[48:37.37]Okay, back up here.
[48:41.33]That leads us to this ledge, which can I make a jump from here?
[48:45.11]Oh my god, what just happened?
[48:46.24]Alright, well that's actually a really good thing, because I was almost just drinking that Estus, because I pressed my brain was pressing X instead of Y. Okay, let's go.
[48:59.41]I should be able to get them from here.
[49:09.28]That looks good.
[49:12.46]Although... What about over there?
[49:16.58]Oh, shit.
[49:17.04]Hold on.
[49:25.59]No.
[49:28.95]I think... A shitload of money just came in.
[49:32.21]Who just gave 50 fucking dollars?
[49:33.53]Let me see who it was.
[49:37.31]Oh, my mouse is up here, right?
[49:39.47]Ow.
[49:42.13]Uh, CatsBeanie, thanks for 50 bucks.
[49:47.50]Thank you so much, CatsBeanie.
[49:49.96]5,000 bits.
[49:51.36]There's a lot I would like to say to you, Jerm, but I just keep it... Jerm is short.
[49:54.46]Uh, I love your VR streams and your Dark Souls streams.
[49:57.44]I'm always happy to watch your stream, and thank you for being yourself.
[50:02.00]Uh, that's... That's really fucking kind of you.
[50:06.46]If you like the Dark Souls streams, then you'll probably like this one too, because this is by the same company.
[50:12.74]Thank you for your extreme generosity.
[50:15.60]Your $50.
[50:16.20]It means a lot.
[50:20.23]Much love to you.
[50:20.97]Thanks for sticking around.
[50:26.33]5,000 bits.
[50:26.67]I wonder if there's anything I can do here.
[50:34.95]That was Cat's Beanie, by the way.
[50:41.54]Alright.
[50:43.29]Blow the whistle.
[50:55.57]Are we in emote only?
[50:56.35]What's going on with chat today?
[50:57.61]Is it because it's Sekiro?
[50:59.57]People just lose their minds over a game like this?
[51:02.41]You found it.
[51:07.00]Now, let us leave this place.
[51:10.14]Yes, my lord.
[51:17.12]To think that this is the only way to run from the fated bloodline is the only answer.
[51:26.86]No.
[51:27.86]Is- are we in escort quest?
[51:31.46]Escort quest territory.
[51:35.03]Get the mouse off the screen.
[51:36.11]There we go.
[51:36.35]Alright.
[51:38.03]Run away.
[51:38.77]I didn't even mean to do that.
[51:40.23]I'm sorry.
[51:41.19]Alright.
[51:41.66]If I walked back out there, it was like jumping up on walls again.
[51:45.48]Hey, let me just check the verticality of the game.
[51:47.54]See how it is.
[52:06.13]Alright.
[52:10.13]That looks cool.
[52:13.33]Where's the note that says, welcome?
[52:19.19]Get good, right?
[52:20.03]Uh-oh.
[52:32.02]The divine air.
[52:37.00]Last we stood together was your uncle's funeral.
[52:44.19]Lord Genichiro.
[52:45.89]Genichiro.
[52:49.97]I... I just hand the sword.
[52:56.29]Hey, you take this.
[52:57.09]You try.
[52:59.11]It's like we have two lives.
[53:01.81]If you can't beat him, I'll give it a go.
[53:14.63]Oh boy.
[53:18.64]1v1.
[53:23.04]Is he gonna have a huge boss bar underneath at the bottom?
[53:25.34]I hope so.
[53:25.82]Uh, not necessarily.
[53:30.52]Oh god.
[53:31.40]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[53:32.94]I didn't heal yet.
[53:35.00]I didn't heal.
[53:35.56]I need to heal first.
[53:40.36]Alright, let's do it.
[53:42.34]So let's tap, tap.
[53:48.41]That little, like, dung dung.
[53:59.76]What the fuck does that mean?
[54:00.64]I am so confused.
[54:19.38]I gotta back up.
[54:21.90]What the fuck?
[54:22.52]Why am I getting like a Batman indicator?
[54:34.19]What the?
[54:35.77]Oh.
[54:36.84]I think... Oh, that's supposed to happen.
[54:44.47]That's how you become Sekiro.
[54:53.41]He turns and he says to the kid, It should have been you!
[54:56.00]You were supposed to go first!
[55:19.03]I would have seen the Batman indicators and then I would have fucking ran.
[55:21.93]Are we about to see this is the E3 teaser?
[55:35.20]I thought he was doing that to his leg.
[55:54.48]Oh, pale blood, you say?
[56:02.13]No matter.
[56:02.53]I just think it all a mere bad dream.
[56:14.25]What is this?
[56:25.14]Don't mind the beeps.
[56:25.96]I'm just gonna mute.
[56:27.28]Alright, the Shinobi Prosthetic.
[56:52.56]The artificial arm of a shinobi passed down by the sculptor.
[56:56.32]A replica of a human arm fitted with a variety of mechanisms, apparently designed with a modification in mind.
[57:02.02]With modification in mind.
[57:03.82]While it appears a number of cuts and is stained thick with blood and oil, it has been impeccably maintained.
[57:12.71]Interesting.
[57:13.27]Okay.
[57:15.97]What do you call yourself?
[57:20.84]eyes the eyes of a wolf who has failed in his duties or so it seems to me that is not your concern spoken like a true shinobi the buddha you do what you will oh I get dialog options how you got here ask about your new arm how'd you get here am I here all I did was
[57:48.51]How long was I asleep?
[57:59.29]Some time has passed since I found you.
[58:02.71]I see.
[58:03.69]However, your master yet lives.
[58:07.57]He's being held prisoner in Ashina Castle.
[58:11.10]They will soon make use of his bloodline.
[58:13.90]I wonder if this is the hub.
[58:14.68]Looking at you, I'm sure you appreciate the value it has.
[58:23.25]Okay.
[58:23.43]Alright.
[58:23.63]Might as well ask.
[58:53.96]What did you do to me?
[58:55.48]That is what I call the Shinobi Prosthetic.
[58:59.30]A fitting fang for a one-armed wolf.
[59:01.48]You're getting to where I have- where I reached.
[59:03.16]Gonna beat the game myself.
[59:04.16]See you later, Jeremiah.
[59:05.40]See you later, fat.
[59:06.02]You can have it.
[59:07.80]Enjoy the game.
[59:09.26]It seems really fucking cool.
[59:12.44]Come to me if you find any Shinobi tools.
[59:15.64]Shinobi tools?
[59:19.12]See for this device You catch on quick.
[59:24.86]So this is kind of blacksmith me shinobi tools I'll find a way to fit them to the shinobi prosthetic Then you'll come to appreciate its worth I Said too much
[59:42.98]You're quite the strange one.
[59:44.88]Huge amount of money just came in again.
[59:46.24]Other peculiar visitors have come to this temple.
[59:49.66]Well, let me just get to the end of the sequence.
[59:51.94]To the right of the gate, leading off the temple grounds.
[59:55.48]Two strangers in strange circumstances.
[59:58.52]To the right of the gate.
[59:59.28]Okay.
[59:59.42]You two might get a little harm.
[60:02.84]Alright, so I got the Shelby Prosthetic.
[60:04.55]Hold on one sec.
[60:07.11]I don't know why this keeps doing this.
[60:11.19]There we go.
[60:11.97]That's better.
[60:16.99]Juno Upsetto gave $50.
[60:19.86]Thank you so much, Juno Upsetto.
[60:23.72]Two very, very large monetary contributions back to back here within 10 minutes.
[60:28.66]So, that's a fucking lot.
[60:30.42]Thanks, guys.
[60:32.24]Juno, you say, you say, I've been under the weather recently.
[60:37.17]Guess it couldn't help to spread a bit of positivity.
[60:39.13]Love you guys.
[60:39.65]Jerma Hart.
[60:41.63]Hell yeah, thank you.
[60:42.93]Sorry to hear you're not feeling well.
[60:43.89]Neither am I.
[60:45.35]Unfortunately, I don't know why, it seems whenever I get sick, or you guys get sick, I get sick too.
[60:49.67]It's weird.
[60:52.25]But, welcome to the hub world.
[60:54.33]This is probably what this is.
[60:55.41]I'd be surprised if it wasn't.
[60:58.81]On Sculptor's Idol.
[60:59.99]Commune.
[61:00.88]Commune.
[61:02.74]Commune with Sculptor's Idol.
[61:06.94]Ooh, Sculptor's Idol.
[61:08.06]Serve as a checkpoint and can be found throughout the... It's like a bonfire.
[61:13.17]Completely replenish vitality and restore one's... One use of resurrection!
[61:20.16]One use of... Additionally, quick items and spirit emblems in storage will be added to your current inventory.
[61:25.40]With some exceptions, resting will also revive defeated enemies.
[61:30.13]Uh, okay.
[61:32.63]So, I get... Resurrection.
[61:36.51]Unseen aid, 30%.
[61:37.35]Uh...
[61:43.94]I... Oh my god.
[61:48.06]Shadows die twice.
[61:48.92]Yeah, that makes sense.
[61:53.67]Um... What have you done?
[61:54.57]Die... Die 335.
[61:55.19]That's 225 dollars.
[61:56.21]That is an uncountable amount of money.
[61:58.19]Thank you for the 225 bucks.
[62:11.97]They say, don't know what to say, but here, laughing my ass off, take it.
[62:19.67]Okay.
[62:25.04]I guess I'll take it.
[62:27.46]That's a fucking ridiculous amount of money, guy.
[62:29.14]Thank you.
[62:30.66]Holy shit.
[62:32.38]Streamer can't count to 225.
[62:33.96]Well, I can, but that's uncountable.
[62:39.32]Another NPC coming in here.
[62:43.62]Jesus.
[62:45.14]Returned from the dead.
[62:46.64]The power of the dragon's life.
[62:48.10]It's uncountable.
[62:48.84]I never thought I'd see it with my own eyes.
[62:51.32]Who are you?
[62:52.52]My name is Emma.
[62:53.86]I am a doctor.
[62:54.76]Thank you, Di.
[62:56.64]What master?
[62:57.50]My god.
[62:58.16]Forgive me.
[62:58.72]That's fucking insane.
[62:59.98]For his safety, I cannot reveal his identity.
[63:03.62]However, my master gave explicit orders to assist you in any way I can.
[63:11.84]Okay.
[63:12.32]So what does she do?
[63:12.74]Oh.
[63:12.80]You got any more of them?
[63:13.74]Is it weird that anytime somebody says that I'm a doctor, I don't believe them?
[63:18.97]I just got, trust me, I'm a doctor.
[63:20.47]You made this gourd.
[63:40.58]yes it was intended for lord kuro but it seems he entrusted it to you I'm sure you may have noticed but the medicinal waters in this gourd spring forth on their own even after being emptied you will find it full again after a short rest yes is there a way to improve it bring me gourd seeds gourd seeds yes medicinal waters for seeds adding new seeds
[64:09.53]will increase the volume of these medicinal waters.
[64:12.90]If you find any, bring them to me.
[64:15.12]Alright.
[64:17.90]OK.
[64:18.28]Do I have one?
[64:19.62]Oh, we don't have any.
[64:21.90]Goodbye.
[64:23.36]Let's say, hold on.
[64:24.18]Let me see.
[64:24.78]What else you got?
[64:25.22]I'm glad you've come.
[64:27.32]I'd like to make a request.
[64:29.03]A request.
[64:29.61]What is it?
[64:30.55]Please show me your face.
[64:33.11]What?
[64:36.96]This white mark, is it a birthmark?
[64:40.70]No.
[64:41.48]That's the correct reaction.
[64:42.96]That must mean it appears on the world who have received the dragon's heritage.
[64:48.64]Or perhaps it's a symptom.
[64:51.74]I have to show my face again.
[64:55.53]Yes, that will be all.
[64:57.95]I'm sorry.
[64:59.53]That was rather rude of me.
[65:02.41]Okay.
[65:02.83]Anything else?
[65:03.23]Let's receive the dragon's heritage.
[65:06.27]Hmm.
[65:06.49]Hmm.
[65:06.63]Hmm.
[65:06.89]Ah, yes.
[65:28.11]Okay, just making sure there's nothing else.
[65:32.97]Yeah, I won't.
[65:33.95]Alright.
[65:35.39]So we've got our... place of rest right here.
[65:40.47]And then we can go this way, or we can go that way.
[65:43.17]Now, the question is, which way is correct?
[65:48.69]Grappling Hook.
[65:50.39]The Shinobi Prosthetic Grappling Hook allows access to normally unreachable places and a chance to take the high ground.
[65:57.37]Nearby grapple points are designated with a circular symbol.
[66:01.31]When this symbol turns green, the grapple point is within reach.
[66:04.08]And it's... I got a left bumper.
[66:10.14]Oh, that's so cool.
[66:11.06]Hold on.
[66:11.42]Let's just take a look.
[66:16.59]Might as well try it.
[66:21.33]Well, that's awesome.
[66:29.45]Can I do it?
[66:30.41]Does it have to have an indicator there, or can I just do it whenever?
[66:33.72]I guess I can just do it.
[66:34.62]Okay, this is Ashina Outskirts.
[66:36.38]I wonder if this is where I need to be.
[66:42.97]Maybe.
[66:45.89]Here is a Sculptor's Idol.
[66:47.37]This is a bonfire.
[66:51.78]Sculptor's Idol Travel.
[66:52.97]You can now instantly travel between Sculptor's Idols that have already been communed with.
[66:57.89]Travel can be accessed via the Sculptor's Idol Travel menu.
[67:05.65]So, any of them.
[67:06.79]So, okay, that's good.
[67:08.71]This goes to important places.
[67:11.99]So this is the, yeah, outskirts.
[67:15.45]There's the dilapidated temple.
[67:17.03]This is the temple, and the outskirts is really all I have.
[67:20.78]I love how important places is here.
[67:22.86]Alright.
[67:23.66]So we got a bonfire.
[67:25.88]Let us... Let's just go.
[67:32.64]Can I grapple that?
[67:35.98]What about down there?
[67:40.35]Can I make that?
[67:41.05]If I jump and grapple, am I gonna die?
[67:44.31]I need to test.
[67:46.13]Should I test it?
[67:51.01]No, you can't.
[67:51.61]You can't, Spider-Man.
[68:02.00]It was worth a try.
[68:11.05]I didn't die, though, somehow.
[68:13.43]Well, there's definitely something I can do over there, but for the sake of progress, let's just see what happens if I go this way.
[68:22.43]Uh, I can go to the building here.
[68:25.10]This is too much freedom!
[68:26.82]I... I can just go that way.
[68:30.92]What about this guy?
[68:32.06]Stealth Deathblow.
[68:32.92]You can perform Stealth Deathblows on opponents unaware of your presence so you can Batman people.
[68:40.25]So the Plunging Deathblow is one of these performed when leaping at an unaware enemy from the high ground.
[68:45.68]So you jump and then swing once you are locked on.
[68:49.56]Let's try it.
[68:53.52]Oh, awesome.
[68:55.23]Awesome.
[68:57.38]And then there's loot.
[68:58.02]Enemies drop loot such as items and money.
[68:59.74]Multiple enemies can be looted at once.
[69:02.10]Really.
[69:03.82]And from a distance away.
[69:04.94]Items found in the world are different than loot in that they must be approached to be picked up.
[69:09.63]Press and hold Y to acquire loot.
[69:12.01]Press Y near world item to pick up.
[69:16.55]So there's just like a money grabber.
[69:19.73]Interesting.
[69:22.36]Some more pellets.
[69:24.32]And you can only have three of these, right?
[69:25.46]Okay.
[69:27.98]Alright, what about down here?
[69:29.08]Let's go... Nothing.
[69:31.72]I'm going to go across that bridge, though.
[69:36.58]Can I make that jump?
[69:37.82]Come on.
[69:38.76]I can grab that from here.
[69:39.61]No?
[69:40.71]Really?
[69:41.69]Come on.
[69:49.47]You can go up, down, around.
[69:54.17]One could get lost simply just doing basic tasks right now.
[70:06.72]Ceramic Shard.
[70:09.28]A piece of pottery that breaks with a satisfying crack.
[70:12.38]Throw it at an enemy to draw their attention.
[70:17.60]I feel like for the stealth portion of this game, some of this stuff is going to be fairly important.
[70:22.95]And why would they give that to me right now?
[70:24.91]Okay, I was going to say, wait a minute.
[70:29.55]Can I just do this?
[70:37.79]I'm trying to jump down.
[70:42.30]You know what I was trying to do.
[70:44.90]He jumped backwards.
[70:49.46]What a pro.
[70:52.03]Alright, let's go.
[70:58.33]No, fuck this man.
[70:59.19]Just go up here and drop down on somebody.
[71:11.05]Whoa!
[71:11.75]You are flurrying right now.
[71:17.09]I want to get that guy from jumping down.
[71:19.72]Wait.
[71:20.24]Grab the items.
[71:20.92]Very important.
[71:23.26]It's a huge jump when you jump off of one of those ledges.
[71:26.72]You launch.
[71:27.70]Alright, let's get this guy.
[71:39.99]So there's a currency.
[71:42.81]Odd.
[71:43.95]There is some sort of currency thing.
[71:51.46]What?
[71:52.70]Okay.
[71:52.92]I thought I was gonna fall.
[71:57.04]Alright.
[71:57.66]Stah!
[71:59.52]Oh my god, guys!
[72:02.28]Oh my god!
[72:04.13]That is so... This is so much money.
[72:09.96]Oh, fuck!
[72:10.46]There's a guy right here.
[72:11.48]Can I stealth kill him?
[72:14.36]I can.
[72:15.32]Anybody see this?
[72:18.68]No.
[72:19.74]Alright, hold on.
[72:22.14]GuyDude... GuyDudeSM, or GuyDudesm, just gave $250 on top of the $225 that Dai gave earlier.
[72:31.72]Oh my god, guys.
[72:37.64]Thank you, Guy.
[72:38.54]GuyDude.
[72:39.04]Hey there, not much to say.
[72:39.94]Just want to donate to probably the only streamer or YouTuber I watch nowadays.
[72:43.05]Thanks, Jeremy, for being a big inspiration.
[72:45.17]UWU.
[72:49.11]Yeah, somebody said, I don't even know how much money that was.
[72:50.97]It's uncountable.
[72:51.89]Anything over $225?
[72:55.15]But holy shit, guys.
[72:56.09]Seriously, thank you, GuyDude, for the $250 fucking dollars.
[73:02.26]What an insane amount of money to receive in one second.
[73:06.90]My goodness.
[73:13.74]I only have 225 fingers.
[73:16.27]Alright, what about this guy?
[73:16.87]Is that a... What if I just surprise this dude?
[73:20.75]Ready, watch this.
[73:23.87]Oh, he has a gun!
[73:31.73]You can... Bulletin... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[73:36.83]Who's here?
[73:38.78]Ash?
[73:39.06]Yeah, I know what that is.
[73:41.40]I can deflect bullets, but more importantly... That was actually kind of scary.
[73:57.85]There's an item over here that I missed.
[74:00.27]So how do you deflect a bullet?
[74:08.12]Ungo's sugar.
[74:09.96]Sugar candy made in Sanpao Temple.
[74:12.78]Sustaining Ungo's blessing.
[74:14.28]Temporarily reduces vitality damage taken from physical attacks.
[74:18.38]Bite the candy and take the Ungo's stance to impart its inhuman benediction.
[74:26.61]By doing so, you endure the excess karma of man from the spirits within.
[74:31.37]They spread this candy across Ashina in order to... So it's like a defense candy.
[74:40.52]I wonder how long it lasts for.
[74:43.44]I've got so many items.
[74:49.46]I wanted to take a look up here.
[74:53.22]Let's get up there.
[75:00.28]Anything up this way?
[75:01.30]You can just climb on houses.
[75:03.26]Ah, I see an item.
[75:11.73]Item that I missed over here.
[75:16.01]More sugar.
[75:18.81]Cool.
[75:19.21]Alright, let's go.
[75:21.60]You can Spider-Man, you just have to be close enough.
[75:32.48]Oops.
[75:32.90]That's not death, right?
[75:33.80]No, it's not.
[75:37.72]Can I get up there?
[75:43.68]Ayayay.
[75:44.20]Is there anything on top of this house?
[75:51.37]Don't fall.
[75:57.25]That's not another... 50 plus dollar donation, right?
[76:03.52]There's not much else I can do up here.
[76:05.36]It is.
[76:06.42]The Reno just gave $50 too.
[76:09.44]I just stopped playing because I'm a bad gamer and was starting to rage.
[76:12.84]Can't wait to watch this happen to you.
[76:15.22]Anyway, I'm enjoying the stream thus far.
[76:16.92]Good luck.
[76:17.34]Thank you so much, Reno.
[76:20.88]I am ready to get absolutely fucking shit on.
[76:27.16]But I'm taking my time.
[76:28.00]I really want to... I don't want to just blow through it, right?
[76:32.49]I really appreciate the $50...
[76:38.33]On top of all the other money that has come in.
[76:42.34]You guys are too much.
[76:43.22]Alright, dog.
[76:44.00]This is a soul staple.
[76:52.15]How am I gonna deal with the dog?
[76:53.31]Let's deal with the dog like this.
[76:56.55]Oh, fuck.
[76:57.35]He's dead?
[77:01.27]Oh, shit.
[77:04.35]The dog... I killed the dog in one hit.
[77:14.94]Is that a checkpoint?
[77:27.07]Wow.
[77:28.55]Alright, cool.
[77:31.75]Dog down.
[77:35.15]Why can't I grab that?
[77:36.27]I'm getting the checkpoint first.
[77:38.57]Bonfire found.
[77:44.57]Sculptor's idol found.
[77:45.58]Alright, rest.
[77:50.06]Travel... Can you travel to every single one?
[77:54.02]Yeah, you can.
[77:55.02]So this is the gate path, and then... Okay, cool.
[77:57.93]Let's get the idol.
[78:05.19]Another ceramic shard.
[78:06.19]Who's this?
[78:06.95]It's a dog.
[78:10.80]What?
[78:11.20]Oh, right, right, right.
[78:12.16]I've respawned the enemies.
[78:13.52]Oh, shit!
[78:15.16]I'm forgetting the most important mechanic in any of these games?
[78:19.86]Really?
[78:21.72]How do you forget that?
[78:23.75]Of all the things to screw up.
[78:26.61]Oh my god, what an idiot.
[78:42.54]Let me think.
[78:43.20]Name two things that happen in every Souls game.
[78:47.56]You die, and enemies respawn.
[78:49.92]Oh.
[78:49.98]I'm not going to make that mistake again.
[79:04.69]Dogs can't even get up here.
[79:05.60]Who cares?
[79:14.50]What's this?
[79:14.82]I know exactly what I'm doing.
[79:16.56]So I got a part.
[79:45.29]They can't be used on their own.
[79:46.41]By giving them to the Sculptor, they can be fitted into the Prosthetic.
[79:49.29]You can quickly return to the Sculptor via travel from a Sculptor's Idol, or use the Homeward Bone.
[79:55.20]Interesting.
[79:56.92]Well, let's just go put it in now.
[79:58.12]I feel like I need to do that now.
[80:00.48]I have an upgrade mechanic.
[80:02.76]Might as well use it.
[80:11.43]Get up there!
[80:12.85]Get up on top!
[80:13.95]Thank you!
[80:22.92]Fucking consumerism.
[80:24.22]What?
[80:30.86]I got something for you.
[80:34.16]Fucking consumerism.
[80:35.42]I don't even know where that came from.
[80:36.50]Why did I read that?
[80:37.76]I found one.
[80:38.90]A shinobi tool?
[80:40.62]Yes.
[80:41.50]I said before that your prosthetic arm was a fang.
[80:45.91]But by fitting shinobi tools to your arm, you'll be able to change the form of that fang.
[80:53.09]I don't know why I read that.
[80:54.23]Hmm.
[81:12.44]Seems you know this prosthetic very well.
[81:14.94]It used to be mine.
[81:16.77]I should calm myself.
[81:18.41]The more I speak of bloodshed, the more demonic my sculptures will become.
[81:23.29]Give it here.
[81:24.63]I'll fit that tool for you.
[81:31.61]Fit new tool.
[81:34.29]There's a little menu here.
[81:35.99]OK.
[81:38.48]Regular Shinobi tools found in the world can be specifically adapted to the Shinobi Prosthetic with the Fit Prosthetic Tool.
[81:44.58]I just... Okay.
[81:49.58]So, Loaded Shuriken.
[81:52.26]Alright.
[81:53.77]Polish... Eh.
[81:55.91]Cost Spirit Embers.
[82:00.15]Spirit Embers?
[82:03.32]Pull a shuriken loaded into the wheel and launch at a target in a single flowing motion.
[82:07.58]The swiftly thrown shuriken damages enemy vitality and posture, particularly against those with a tendency to take to the air.
[82:21.87]Alright, loaded shuriken.
[82:28.45]Okay, so is that on there?
[82:31.15]If you want more forms for that fang of yours, you'll need to search for more shinobi tools.
[82:37.33]There's no turning back from this path now.
[82:40.28]The least I can do is load your arm.
[82:43.98]Another 50 bucks.
[82:47.12]$50 from Koopa Troopa.
[82:52.10]Hey Jerm, I thought this was the right time to donate to you.
[82:53.97]You have offered me and my brother so much entertainment.
[82:56.57]I thought it was time to give back.
[82:57.81]Thanks for everything and enjoy the game.
[83:01.68]Thank you so much for the $50.
[83:10.27]Happy you and your brother can enjoy the streams and videos and stuff.
[83:13.93]Thank you so much.
[83:16.15]Seriously.
[83:20.33]Big money today.
[83:21.15]I know.
[83:21.49]Apparently.
[83:24.93]Prosthetic tool.
[83:25.77]Prosthetic tools are Shinobi tools adapted for use with Shinobi prosthetics.
[83:28.51]I have a shuriken now.
[83:30.43]So equipment menu, and then using them is spirit emblems.
[83:37.08]So prosthetic tools, right bumper.
[83:41.10]Let's see here.
[83:46.24]So I have prosthetic tool slots.
[83:48.11]There are three slots available.
[83:51.61]On the equipment selection screen, the controls can be viewed through Y.
[83:56.14]Okay.
[83:58.46]So I have the loaded shuriken.
[84:01.15]And that's all I can do now.
[84:04.09]So that should be right bumper is how to use this.
[84:08.39]What is this?
[84:08.75]Okay.
[84:17.24]The true sculptor.
[84:18.86]Huh.
[84:19.00]I wonder if you can do something with this.
[84:20.31]Very cool.
[84:20.51]So now, I guess it's time...
[84:47.63]Spirit... Oh, boy.
[84:48.87]Interesting.
[84:49.33]Interesting.
[85:14.42]I wonder if this is... Jerma's crying right now.
[85:17.22]What?
[85:22.15]So you can only use this twice.
[85:26.15]Before you have to redo it.
[85:31.77]Interesting.
[85:34.03]Purchase spirit emblems.
[85:36.82]Two out of fifteen.
[85:39.12]How much do they cost?
[85:39.80]Ten bucks?
[85:42.44]What?
[85:42.62]What?
[85:46.09]Shit, I don't even know how this works.
[85:53.26]I wonder if I should... Should I buy a couple of these?
[85:58.90]Not yet.
[86:01.40]Prayer bead.
[86:02.17]What is the unseen aid?
[86:03.53]30%.
[86:03.55]I have no idea what it means.
[86:06.37]Let's just keep going.
[86:09.47]I've got no idea what's going on.
[86:14.88]I just got two thousand dollars, don't be so stingy.
[86:21.71]Oh yeah, I just- I just fucking consumerism.
[86:30.26]Wait, I can get up there.
[86:30.96]Oops, oops, oops, oops!
[86:35.99]No, no, stay up there!
[86:37.41]I just Mario jumped on his head!
[86:40.52]No, go up here!
[86:45.42]Alright, we're fine.
[86:48.34]Fucking consumerism!
[86:57.39]They'll forget about me in a second.
[86:58.47]Can I grab that?
[87:03.86]They still... They don't know I'm here, right?
[87:05.84]Is there like an aggro range or something?
[87:11.26]Alright, we got... There's a giant turkey.
[87:14.97]There's a... What?
[87:15.87]Why?
[87:16.21]Wait, hold on a minute.
[87:16.77]There's an enemy chickens?
[87:18.63]Giant chickens!
[87:25.07]No!
[87:25.89]Why are there huge chickens?
[87:28.64]And why did I just murder it for no reason?
[87:37.23]Uh, that's so dumb.
[87:38.75]I love it.
[87:40.63]Alright, we're just circling back around.
[87:44.11]That's the best enemy in any Souls game, I think.
[87:47.49]Personally, speaking here.
[87:52.59]I'm so glad that there are giant chickens.
[87:57.46]I can go that.
[87:58.00]Let's go over there.
[88:03.58]This isn't a Souls game.
[88:04.72]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[88:07.21]Alright, uh, guy right there.
[88:09.78]That is a super bad guy, so I need to be prepared.
[88:13.92]So let's go like this.
[88:14.94]Let's wrap around.
[88:21.91]Does he see me?
[88:22.77]Can he see me?
[88:24.71]There's an item over here.
[88:28.45]Watch out for that super bad guy.
[88:30.86]Okay, still hidden.
[88:36.14]Fistful of Ash.
[88:37.30]Maybe I should use this.
[88:38.38]Oh, he sees me.
[88:38.96]Alright, this is the first time I'm going to get to see this.
[88:43.06]Some enemies use unguardable perilous attacks signified with a danger symbol.
[88:50.51]When these occur, watch carefully and try to respond properly as each type requires a specific response.
[88:59.66]What?
[89:03.02]As thrust... So, deflect...
[89:07.00]Jump?
[89:08.34]Or a grab?
[89:13.72]What is, what do they mean by sweep?
[89:15.54]So sweeping attack, I'm assuming from left to right.
[89:19.06]Thrust is straightforward.
[89:20.44]Grab is a grab.
[89:21.82]Okay, let me just take a minute to figure this out.
[89:24.08]Sweep is jump.
[89:27.27]Like that?
[89:28.27]That's what that means, right?
[89:29.25]Let me see.
[89:33.04]Oops-a-daisy.
[89:35.44]Alright, I get it.
[89:42.27]So that's a sweep.
[89:51.05]What the hell does that mean, though?
[90:00.32]So you can interrupt it though, too.
[90:01.52]I think.
[90:07.26]What about my... Should I use my weapon thing?
[90:30.58]Don't even let him do it.
[90:31.38]Don't even let him do it!
[90:34.40]Oh, shit.
[90:37.34]Oh, fuck.
[90:37.70]No, no, no, no, no!
[90:38.81]Okay, that symbol right there fucked me up.
[90:48.29]Oh, Jesus.
[90:51.24]Safety roll.
[90:52.36]Alright, so I thought I had...
[90:56.40]To stay down after being knocked to the ground surely means death.
[91:00.52]Safety roll can be used to quickly recover from being knocked down or posture broken.
[91:06.33]A will be a safety roll.
[91:26.38]There we go.
[91:28.72]One more.
[91:33.76]So what it was be- I'm trying to remember the controls for that.
[91:40.27]Oh, that was a fucking weird move!
[91:44.17]Oh shit, I'm in trouble.
[91:45.79]I'm dead.
[91:47.77]What the hell was that?
[91:54.22]He did this little, like... He, like, did a little tiny kick.
[92:05.02]Wait, is this... Die or resurrect?
[92:07.77]Why do I have... What?
[92:12.59]Hold on.
[92:13.03]Why do I have a, like, fucking arcade continue screen?
[92:15.55]Should I come back?
[92:19.03]Resurrect!
[92:21.64]I get to die two times!
[92:22.64]That's the title of the game!
[92:24.06]What?!
[92:27.72]The Divine Heir's blood grants the ability to return from the dead using Resurrective Power.
[92:34.30]One charge is always restored by resting at a Sculptor's idol, killing enemies restoring additional charges.
[92:41.43]Resurrection becomes unusable immediately after using it, but killing enemies will make it available again.
[92:49.80]Alright, so... When you kill people, you get to charge your comeback to life bar.
[92:58.96]Shadows die twice.
[93:00.95]Sometimes, if they've killed enough people.
[93:03.83]Okay, let's go.
[93:06.17]That's a different move.
[93:07.55]Oh my god, I'm gonna die again.
[93:08.53]Do I get... Do shadows refill my health thing?! !
[93:35.27]That's a grab.
[93:36.05]Okay, grab is different.
[93:37.77]Holy shit.
[93:43.16]Back it up.
[93:50.27]Jesus Christ!
[93:51.23]I'm almost out of posture.
[93:53.77]I had it too.
[94:04.20]I'm dead.
[94:04.94]I'm dead.
[94:05.44]Safety roll!
[94:05.96]Safety roll!
[94:20.78]Oh, fuck, man!
[94:21.70]When he swings that one, you gotta... So you don't want to take that many hits.
[94:34.62]I gotta get back to my full posture again.
[94:42.68]Oh fuck, I'm dead.
[94:51.59]Oh boy.
[94:54.25]Shadows die thrice.
[94:58.35]Alright, let's see what happens here.
[95:04.27]Experience toward the next skill point and current sin in hand are halved upon death.
[95:11.03]Sends them money.
[95:13.69]Everything lost is gone for good.
[95:16.52]There are no known means to escape this loss.
[95:18.60]However, through the grace of the gods or Buddha, it may not be impossible.
[95:23.90]So wait a minute.
[95:28.74]When you die, you lose half of everything.
[95:34.01]And there is no go back and pick up your money.
[95:40.48]Oh, shit.
[95:41.58]Really?
[95:48.56]Oh.
[95:49.18]Wow.
[95:49.56]44.
[95:49.68]No.
[95:50.00]You lose it forever.
[95:59.37]Give me...
[96:03.07]Just don't die.
[96:04.39]Apparently, I have no more pellets.
[96:06.47]Alright.
[96:08.79]Let's get back over there.
[96:11.26]Now that I've, uh, scripted, scripted death.
[96:15.90]Is the chicken back?
[96:17.38]Just don't aggro the chicken.
[96:19.68]Let's do this again.
[96:20.20]At least I can just... Alright, shadows only die... Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[96:25.21]Get up there.
[96:25.73]No, never mind.
[96:26.15]Let's go.
[96:26.59]Let's go.
[96:26.95]Fuck it.
[96:27.19]I'm ready.
[96:51.67]Watch that fucking sword.
[96:57.52]Who broke?
[96:57.96]Me or him?
[96:58.82]Oh, come on.
[96:59.42]What?
[97:01.22]He's so close.
[97:06.91]Alright, let's go.
[97:27.58]Fuck.
[97:30.06]No, fuck you, you're not doing that.
[97:42.11]Break him, break him!
[97:45.51]Alright, see you later.
[97:52.98]A loose prayer bead offering four of them at a Sculptor's Idol will increase maximum vitality and posture.
[98:00.46]Apparently the wolf has one bead.
[98:02.12]Oh, that's leveling up.
[98:06.41]Got a seed.
[98:11.19]Do you reckon he practices these noises in front of the bathroom mirror?
[98:18.99]What?
[98:20.93]So, a seed from the healing waters... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[98:23.01]A gift to Emma to increase the maximum uses of the healing gourd.
[98:27.52]Right.
[98:29.04]There it is.
[98:30.32]I hope you can't... You can't lose these, right?
[98:34.54]I would hope not.
[98:36.52]It would be pretty bad if you could.
[98:41.03]But, anyways, let's take a look up here.
[98:45.57]Make sure I don't miss anything.
[98:51.08]Doesn't look like I missed anything.
[98:52.44]Yes, I did.
[98:54.68]Shadows check both ways, aka twice, before crossing the street.
[99:01.34]Just a pellet, though.
[99:10.90]Alright.
[99:12.30]Well, that guy's not gonna respawn.
[99:14.20]He's like a super enemy.
[99:15.11]I'm gonna go back.
[99:23.80]Good one, somebody said.
[99:28.35]I actually laughed.
[99:29.25]See?
[99:29.49]Good.
[99:31.03]The enhanced physical attributes option has been unlocked in the sculptor's idol menu.
[99:35.37]You can spend four prayer beads to create a prayer necklace, which will permanently increase your vitality and posture.
[99:45.64]I need four.
[99:47.94]Well, let's just go get our...
[99:53.21]Gord upgraded.
[100:02.75]So, what are those bar... what is the thing in the lower left?
[100:07.71]See that pizza pie with the hat with the pizza slice taken out of it?
[100:10.93]Is that the time when... what is that timer?
[100:15.34]Notice anything different?
[100:16.89]Yes.
[100:17.59]Like what?
[100:18.57]I died.
[100:19.53]The divine heir's voice reached out to me, and suddenly I was alive again.
[100:23.92]It's your resurrection pizza, okay.
[100:25.32]So you died.
[100:27.34]And now you're alive again.
[100:29.23]So that means it has to do with resurrection.
[100:32.65]Resurrection?
[100:33.89]Lord Kuro.
[100:35.35]It's said to be a power of the Divine Heir's dragon heritage.
[100:39.47]Those who have been given the power of resurrection, they are revived upon death repeatedly.
[100:45.87]Impossible.
[100:47.15]Yes.
[100:48.43]It is rather strange.
[100:50.25]And yet, it is happening here and now.
[100:54.11]Let me know if you notice any more changes.
[100:58.74]Of course.
[101:01.54]It's a FromSoftware game, of course.
[101:03.52]If they give you the option to just die, there's probably some reason why you shouldn't resurrect.
[101:12.53]Right?
[101:14.45]Okay, here.
[101:14.92]If you could just resurrect, there wouldn't be a, like, battlefield-style just die button.
[101:21.74]Hmm.
[101:36.58]I don't take any offense to that.
[101:38.66]If it's effective, then that's cause for celebration.
[101:42.47]That's what I meant toward you.
[101:44.09]Please bring me any other points you find.
[101:47.29]I should be able to further increase the volume of the medicinal water.
[101:53.36]Okay, cool.
[101:54.64]So, I have a question.
[101:57.63]So when you die, right, does it matter if you resurrect or not?
[102:01.67]Do you still lose half of all your shit no matter what?
[102:04.91]Or does the resurrection stop the halving of your stuff?
[102:11.36]No.
[102:13.54]You don't lose shit when you... Okay, so there is two sides there.
[102:17.52]There's definitely gonna be some kind of penalty for resurrecting.
[102:20.57]But the penalty for not resurrecting is losing half your shit.
[102:23.73]Hmm.
[102:24.35]Okay.
[102:26.51]Okay.
[102:27.93]I didn't... Hold on.
[102:29.01]I didn't go this way at all.
[102:30.91]What is over here?
[102:34.32]This is... An NPC that I haven't even talked to.
[102:37.54]Hmm.
[102:43.36]Never seen you before.
[102:45.10]Your name?
[102:48.99]Won't tell me.
[102:50.01]But you do have the look of a skilled shinobi.
[102:52.79]A shinobi.
[102:54.84]Or perhaps.
[102:57.20]Sir, please heed my humble request.
[103:00.02]Face me in battle.
[103:01.98]Face me?
[103:05.06]I wasn't ready for that.
[103:11.45]Should I?
[103:12.21]Wait a minute.
[103:12.71]This is like a FromSoftware game.
[103:13.89]Should I let this guy kill me?
[103:14.77]No.
[103:18.14]Should I not have done that to this guy?
[103:19.52]Is that it?
[103:24.56]Are we friends now?
[103:38.43]Do I get to have your house?
[103:39.41]Infested.
[103:57.11]What brings you to a run-down temple like this?
[104:01.60]Seems you have a lot on your mind.
[104:03.62]Say, why don't you use me for some sword practice?
[104:06.68]It might come in handy for whatever your mission is.
[104:09.54]A warm body that can't die might prove useful to you.
[104:14.48]I volunteer mine.
[104:15.52]It's kind of morbid, but okay.
[104:18.85]Yeah, I guess.
[104:24.13]He's just bored.
[104:26.41]Let's do it again.
[104:27.71]Training.
[104:28.93]Practice the basics of evasion, practice the basics of attacking.
[104:31.73]Let's deflect.
[104:32.25]This is cool.
[104:55.94]Sometimes relentless attack is not enough to deflect an enemy's attack.
[104:58.52]Damage is their posture.
[104:59.56]Do three death blows.
[105:03.21]I'm dead.
[105:13.55]I'm back.
[105:28.88]I will.
[105:34.94]Oh, can you hold a button with that?
[105:37.73]I didn't even know you could do this.
[105:39.25]Hold on.
[105:40.31]You can.
[105:42.59]So there is a hold down in charge.
[105:44.51]Alright, basics of attacking.
[105:47.61]In that case, I stand as your opponent.
[105:54.37]An enemy with broken posture is vulnerable to three deathblows.
[106:00.55]Yes, yes, yes.
[106:13.92]I wonder if eventually I can get... I'm probably going to get some posture breaking stuff.
[106:24.02]Right.
[106:24.54]I'm going to get a thing that costs 10 emblems to use and it's going to break like 50% posture or something.
[106:30.57]Right.
[106:30.77]Step dodge.
[106:31.65]We didn't really even learn this.
[106:38.92]It allows you to avoid attacks.
[106:39.76]Dodging won't compromise enemy posture, but may help one avoid damage.
[106:44.38]Evade enemy attacks and then attack and perform three Death Flows.
[106:48.59]Yes, I will.
[106:53.77]I like how the animation of a Death Flow can happen in front or behind.
[107:00.68]It's cool.
[107:11.14]Uh-huh.
[107:20.99]Again!
[107:26.59]Spend the whole stream killing this one guy.
[107:28.63]So you can feel good.
[107:30.71]Wait, there's more.
[107:34.13]I think it's about time we tried something closer to a real fight.
[107:38.04]Don't you?
[107:38.84]Come at me with the intent to kill.
[107:41.04]Okay.
[107:41.46]No better way to prepare for the real thing.
[107:44.96]What's wrong?
[107:46.20]Why do you go to such lengths?
[107:48.20]Have to pass the time.
[107:50.03]And the other half.
[107:50.69]Extra training?
[107:52.55]I want to loosen that furrowed brow of yours.
[107:55.29]Alright.
[107:56.83]Enough talk.
[107:58.13]Sorry.
[107:58.51]Let's begin.
[108:00.83]Free combat is now available.
[108:03.82]Um, begin free combat.
[108:05.51]Fundamentals!
[108:06.63]You got more?
[108:11.61]Practice what you've learned, sure thing.
[108:15.11]Fine, I'll break you.
[108:23.32]I'll break you.
[108:27.43]Again!
[108:35.51]So when they go for a grab, they don't get stabbed.
[108:42.01]Yes.
[108:43.01]Splendidly done.
[108:47.04]New training is available.
[108:51.02]What?
[108:52.66]Countering?
[108:56.06]Well, this is going to be a consecutive deflection.
[109:02.09]In that case, I stand as your opponent.
[109:07.91]Okay.
[109:09.27]Deflecting once doesn't always mean an enemy will stop attacking.
[109:11.89]Consecutive attacks can be countered with consecutive deflections, which can greatly damage enemy posture.
[109:18.18]Deflect all enemy attacks and perform three death blows.
[109:24.04]Let's see what happens here.
[109:27.94]One, two, three, four.
[109:30.04]You gotta get through it.
[109:30.76]You gotta time it.
[109:31.84]So it's...
[109:38.58]That's gonna be so hard later on.
[109:47.22]Imagine some of the bosses later on that you're gonna have to do that like ten times in a row.
[109:55.55]Alright, Vitality and Posture.
[109:56.71]Might as well just practice now.
[110:03.48]The lower one's vitality, the slower their posture recover is.
[110:06.06]This is good to know.
[110:07.44]For enemies with seemingly unbreakable posture, use techniques such as dodge.
[110:12.99]Counterattack reduces their vitality, making their posture easier to break.
[110:18.21]Ah.
[110:20.06]Okay.
[110:21.64]So... I... There's a... Alright, this is very important information.
[110:29.59]So if somebody has high health, you're not going to ever be able to break their posture if they're hard to break through.
[110:36.83]So you have to get their health down by dodging or by hurting them, not by going blow to blow with the sword to a point where you can bring down their posture.
[110:48.76]I probably would have been raging at this later on.
[110:52.08]This is fucking stupid.
[110:53.84]Why does this guy have such high posture?
[110:55.32]Game's fucking broken.
[110:56.54]So it's good that I did this.
[111:04.83]Okay.
[111:09.72]So they recover posture slowly.
[111:13.52]Oh, that's so much better.
[111:14.80]Now they just... Yeah, look at that.
[111:16.80]Just by swinging on it like once or twice.
[111:22.48]Yeah, that is a huge piece of information that you need to know.
[111:36.64]Look at that.
[111:36.98]Look at how bad it is.
[111:40.04]Yeah.
[111:40.68]Alright.
[111:42.18]Glad I figured this out.
[111:43.22]Alright, let's come back to the, uh, back out here, please.
[111:50.97]I don't want to phase out.
[111:52.71]Okay.
[112:08.23]I did not see this tutorial.
[112:11.27]This guy's actually fairly easy just to walk by and never see.
[112:15.87]It doesn't lower their posture, only their posture regeneration.
[112:18.11]Yeah, but that's still a big deal, though.
[112:21.19]I'm gonna do it all.
[112:22.39]Countering thrust attacks.
[112:25.55]You can kill through vitality as well, as long as you can hit them, I guess, somewhere in their back or a place where they can't... ...block.
[112:36.18]Rost attacks cannot be guarded, but they can be countered by deflecting or step dodging to the side.
[112:43.45]Okay, I was kind of panicking when I saw this before.
[112:46.43]So if you do a side dodge, you can counter.
[112:49.27]Or if you deflect.
[112:52.91]Or do a step dodge.
[112:56.31]Alright, so there you go.
[112:56.85]So before, I thought you had to... Okay.
[112:59.08]Okay.
[113:04.08]You can also block it too.
[113:05.46]At the right time, that is.
[113:07.44]You gotta be perfect.
[113:14.04]I'm not certain I'm confident in being able to deflect that.
[113:17.18]Especially if it goes right for you and you can't block it.
[113:25.70]What happens if this guy kills you?
[113:29.33]You take his place.
[113:32.92]This is important.
[113:33.66]Sweep attacks.
[113:40.00]Sweep attacks cannot be guarded or deflected.
[113:42.00]They must be jumped over to be avoided.
[113:45.31]Jump kicking an enemy during sweep attacks deals heavy posture damage.
[113:50.59]Perfect.
[113:52.03]Often leading directly to a death blow.
[113:55.92]Also great to know.
[113:57.44]So jump in midair near the enemy jump kick and it does a ton of posture damage.
[114:02.84]Let's take a look.
[114:05.76]Oh, hold on.
[114:07.14]Oh, it's no.
[114:07.80]Alright, hold on a minute.
[114:08.67]It's just A twice.
[114:12.25]Right.
[114:13.79]Come on, let's go.
[114:16.67]Holy shit, if I knew that before.
[114:23.21]That last boss that I, little mini boss that I fought, that general, I would have killed him in probably 15 seconds.
[114:44.40]Again.
[114:44.64]How far?
[114:46.04]Okay, you gotta be close though.
[114:48.08]You can't do it from that far away.
[114:51.94]Again.
[114:52.92]So the easiest way to remember that is Sweep is AA.
[115:11.57]Thrust is dodge or deflect.
[115:14.73]And grab is dodge.
[115:18.07]Let's do it again.
[115:18.57]Free combat.
[115:19.21]What do you got?
[115:35.19]Back up this way.
[115:37.78]Come on.
[115:38.82]You're too far away.
[115:40.46]Oh, okay.
[115:41.50]I've got to get that right.
[115:44.74]Ooh.
[115:45.60]It's hard to tell sometimes.
[115:46.58]Ooh.
[115:50.48]Thrust.
[115:50.98]Thrust is deflect or dodge.
[115:52.39]You know what?
[115:52.77]I'm going to do dodge.
[115:54.47]If I see that and I know it's a thrust, I'm going to dodge.
[115:58.63]Excellent.
[116:06.29]I expected all this of you.
[116:09.72]Yeah, the sword comes up to the head.
[116:13.57]Oh, easier on me.
[116:19.17]Apologize.
[116:23.99]I'm so sorry, sir.
[116:26.09]I don't mean to kill you.
[116:26.97]I've killed him like 12 times.
[116:29.52]Give thanks or apologize.
[116:30.86]I feel like this is important.
[116:34.92]Maybe I'm going to say sorry.
[116:38.65]Give thanks or apologize.
[116:40.21]Give thanks or apologize.
[116:41.34]One false move and this could go wrong.
[116:44.52]You have my gratitude.
[116:47.22]What do you mean?
[116:47.90]I am truly grateful to you for enduring such pain for me.
[116:52.84]Apologize, bloodthirsty streamer.
[116:55.72]I know what I said before, but actually I'm used to the pain.
[116:59.75]I see.
[117:02.89]What?
[117:03.47]I'm just glad that my curse is of use to someone.
[117:06.27]Feels as if there could be a purpose to it after all.
[117:11.60]OK, so that's the training.
[117:14.95]What about talk?
[117:16.33]This temple attracts those with nowhere else to go.
[117:19.67]I certainly fit that description.
[117:20.85]Somebody did a from left.
[117:22.35]A from left?
[117:23.79]Yep.
[117:24.33]And I suppose that's why interesting things make their way into the offering box from time to time.
[117:29.89]It's in every game.
[117:32.99]Wait, something interesting in the box?
[117:35.31]What's in the box?
[117:38.83]Items that become unavailable elsewhere end up in the offering box.
[117:44.17]When the box is illuminated, it means an item has found its way inside.
[117:47.07]Items can be obtained by inspecting the box and offering money.
[117:49.99]The box is empty.
[117:53.65]Okay.
[117:57.06]First P?
[118:00.44]I think it's time for the first P of the day.
[118:03.92]Eh, two hours.
[118:05.04]Two hours per P.
[118:07.72]See you in like two minutes.
[120:45.83]Hello.
[120:49.23]Who the fuck would sub to Jerma?
[120:51.91]I don't know.
[120:56.79]You?
[120:56.87]You're subbed.
[121:00.32]Somebody give... There's $50 here from two minutes ago.
[121:06.68]Toshiro.TV just gave $50.
[121:08.14]You guys are showering me with fucking money tonight.
[121:13.48]Holy shit.
[121:14.10]Thank you.
[121:15.95]How do you feel knowing you can hurricanrana in FromSoftware games?
[121:20.73]It's very satisfying to do these moves.
[121:29.43]A green shower.
[121:31.57]Seriously, I don't even know what to say.
[121:34.12]Thank you, everybody.
[121:37.35]This is an absolute shitload of money.
[121:40.19]Thank you.
[121:42.39]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[121:43.47]That's all I can say.
[121:44.83]I can't believe it.
[121:49.14]Let's hope you're enjoying the stream.
[121:51.08]Speaking of the stream.
[121:56.18]Do you ever go to bed soaking?
[121:57.68]Oh.
[121:59.74]Do you ever go to bed soaking wet?
[122:00.98]I do not.
[122:01.78]I do not go to bed soaking wet.
[122:05.46]Cool.
[122:05.80]So we learned some tactics, some techniques.
[122:08.30]Things that are good to know.
[122:10.84]Let's continue the journey.
[122:15.13]Didn't I get a better healing gourd?
[122:17.79]Healing gourd!
[122:18.77]There we go.
[122:22.87]Purchase, travel, enhance out of heaven.
[122:25.64]Can I lose these prayer beads?
[122:28.98]I'm scared I'm gonna lose the prayer beads.
[122:35.51]Turn on the Japanese dialog for a cutscene or two.
[122:41.08]Alright.
[122:41.80]After I... After I beat the first boss.
[122:54.21]I'll do it.
[122:54.79]Which will be in like 15 minutes if I can beat it the first try.
[123:01.54]Back to it.
[123:02.06]This is where the... We were just right here.
[123:03.58]This guy doesn't respawn, I don't think.
[123:10.68]Progress.
[123:17.95]Why do you cough then mute the mic?
[123:20.05]Well, because it's hard to suppress a cough, and I have to reach forward and press...
[123:26.06]button here on my stream deck.
[123:28.22]So what happens is I end up getting like a quarter of it out before I have to press this button here to mute.
[123:33.68]So it's hard to sometimes predict it's going to happen, mute, and then do it.
[123:37.62]I've done it.
[123:38.70]You probably heard a few times it just go dead silence because I caught it early.
[123:46.11]I am trying to squelch that though.
[123:49.41]I do apologize if it's annoying.
[123:52.43]Okay.
[123:52.53]Okay.
[123:56.70]Trees.
[123:57.22]Look at all these places to jump to.
[123:58.86]Alright, what have we got?
[124:00.08]One guy.
[124:01.92]Crows?
[124:02.56]We're gonna go crow route?
[124:05.54]Maybe.
[124:07.34]I'm not quite close enough to that.
[124:08.86]We can go this way.
[124:19.18]I have to see what's going on with these crows.
[124:26.00]Ooh.
[124:27.92]Light coin purse.
[124:28.90]A purse filled with a small amount of sand that can be used to acquire the sand inside.
[124:33.28]Has a somewhat satisfying weight to it.
[124:38.08]I'm not opening that.
[124:46.63]Oh my god.
[124:47.67]I was trying to jump.
[124:52.59]Somebody has a gun.
[124:56.34]Who has the gun?
[124:58.00]That's... guy has... Oh my lord, there's a lot of people here.
[125:08.99]Which one has the gun?
[125:09.87]Not even locked onto him!
[125:21.63]That guy.
[125:22.69]No, I think he doesn't have a gun.
[125:34.02]Oh my god, there's too many people.
[125:38.30]Actually too many people.
[125:43.07]I'm gonna fucking die.
[125:45.65]Aggro'd the whole entire fucking city.
[125:55.45]So, unlike other FromSoftware games... No, I was just locked onto that guy!
[126:01.55]It's actually really hard to fight more than one person at a time.
[126:06.98]Before, you could kind of just get like a big weapon and just swing it in a circle and kill five people.
[126:10.88]Oh my god, somebody just gave 20 community subs!
[126:33.69]No, wrong guy!
[126:34.57]I want to walk down to the guy in front of me!
[126:37.99]Why the hell would I want to walk down to the guy behind him?
[126:43.00]I can't see shit.
[126:50.87]Oh fuck, I'm dead.
[127:01.31]Come on, swing.
[127:02.97]Come on.
[127:03.87]Swing.
[127:05.51]There's still somebody with a gun.
[127:20.34]Alright, who gave the 20 community subs?
[127:26.00]Seriously, I missed it.
[127:30.07]Those gift subs just crashed the app on my phone.
[127:33.85]It's Bob.
[127:35.31]It's Bob time.
[127:39.88]Thank you, Bob.
[127:42.00]And thank you for your time.
[127:45.24]Alright.
[127:46.14]I gotta get up.
[127:48.28]I'm killing this guy.
[127:52.19]Can I, like, stealth grab him or something?
[127:58.53]I guess, I guess so.
[128:01.25]That whizzed right by my head.
[128:03.87]I'm just gonna take it.
[128:04.57]Because the... Oh!
[128:12.34]What?
[128:13.00]I didn't... No!
[128:15.74]I was trying to... I was gonna block it.
[128:17.72]I couldn't even see him.
[128:19.94]Should I resurrect?
[128:27.34]Oh, I don't know what this means.
[128:28.56]I don't know how bad this is.
[128:29.80]No, I'm just dying.
[128:33.43]This is gonna be bad for me to resurrect this many times in the beginning of the game.
[128:43.22]I'm so scared to resurrect.
[128:52.82]Alright, well this time, I don't want to aggro the entire camp.
[129:00.82]Death is worse.
[129:01.77]I don't know that yet.
[129:09.55]I still have the coin purse, so I'm good.
[129:11.92]Alright, let's jump down here and stealth.
[129:24.23]I don't think there's a penalty for resurrecting.
[129:29.92]Where's the guy with the shoot you in the head sniper rifle?
[129:37.40]There's an item over there.
[129:38.68]He's right there.
[129:39.60]Alright.
[129:40.22]I'm gonna wrap around.
[129:40.92]Here's what I'm gonna do.
[129:43.36]I'm going over there.
[129:43.94]I'm gonna jump on the tree.
[129:46.58]Can they see me on top of them?
[129:47.60]Do they have the ability to look up in the air?
[129:53.55]I don't, I don't, let's eavesdrop.
[129:54.83]I want that item down here.
[130:24.52]What?
[130:24.96]Where was my- didn't- can't you do a stealth takedown?
[130:28.74]I thought it was a stealth takedown!
[130:31.30]Huh?
[130:32.74]Alright.
[130:48.07]It's just a fucking vase.
[130:54.32]I thought if you jumped off of the, uh, of a perch, you could do a... Apparently not.
[131:03.12]Alright, well, that's good to know.
[131:04.80]So I'm gonna go, let's just keep... Wait, there's a guy right there.
[131:10.26]Three people there.
[131:11.52]Oh, there's the whole camp.
[131:16.40]I can take that guy out.
[131:17.62]And nobody over here, right?
[131:18.40]Ah!
[131:27.52]Holy shit, this guy's huge.
[131:31.46]Alright.
[131:32.42]No, don't do that!
[131:33.08]Like, I had to do that.
[131:44.67]I had to get the big dude with the Malibu.
[131:49.60]Only one guy saw that.
[131:51.72]This guy.
[132:00.01]And there's an item in here too.
[132:03.67]I'm being followed.
[132:05.19]Mibu Balloon of Wealth.
[132:07.67]A Mibu balloon filled with fountainhead water imbued with the blessing of wealth.
[132:12.37]If one pops the golden balloon and prays, those its water splashes upon will acquire more coin for a period of time.
[132:21.25]Mibu means aquatic life or life born of the water.
[132:23.63]The Ashina consider the fountainhead water itself to be worthy of worship.
[132:31.28]I don't got time to fucking care about this right now, but you can get more items.
[132:35.76]Ooh, what's this?
[132:36.26]Ooh, ooh.
[132:39.11]I don't know.
[132:40.11]Who saw me?
[132:41.23]Who has a gun shooting at me?
[132:42.15]It's that person.
[132:46.15]Reloading.
[132:52.06]That was a really quick reload, by the way.
[133:08.81]Just take them all out.
[133:10.08]Oh, fuck.
[133:23.07]I got too greedy there.
[133:25.05]Just drink.
[133:25.49]I don't want to do that again.
[133:32.61]What?
[133:33.54]How did I not deflect that?
[133:35.64]You're making me look bad!
[133:39.31]I almost cleared the whole area.
[133:40.45]I feel like I should use some of this shit.
[133:51.25]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[133:53.37]There's a lot to look at here.
[133:54.39]Hold on.
[133:58.89]Don't fall off that.
[134:01.63]Why would you let me go over there?
[134:08.14]Don't want to miss anything... like something over here.
[134:11.49]Right?
[134:15.19]No.
[134:17.23]Why are you here?
[134:19.21]Why are you making me think there's something over there?
[134:23.96]Typical From.
[134:25.26]You know what I mean?
[134:28.38]Is that an enemy?
[134:31.70]Uh... I think that's an NPC.
[134:38.72]It is an NPC, but who is this?
[134:51.76]It's just a chicken.
[134:53.82]Alright, we're fine.
[135:07.09]I am going to sneak in here, though.
[135:12.32]Look at this free shit.
[135:14.44]Coin purse.
[135:16.18]Coin purse.
[135:19.34]Coin purse.
[135:21.16]Nice.
[135:21.66]Now the question is, is the person up top an NPC?
[135:28.14]And are they gonna get startled if I jump up here?
[135:36.47]Let's just see what happens.
[135:37.77]They have a marker over them, so... I'm going to assume you're friendly.
[135:43.67]For now.
[135:43.99]Uh... Have you seen... I'm not your son.
[135:47.81]Sorry.
[135:48.82]Sorry.
[136:03.79]She reminds me of one of those Bloodborne enemies that has the lanterns.
[136:09.27]Or what if I just pretend I'm the son?
[136:14.09]What?
[136:15.17]Nothing to say.
[136:16.49]If I don't say anything... Does your stomach hurt or something?
[136:18.91]She thinks I'm her kid.
[136:19.69]You always had a weak stomach.
[136:21.75]If I talk, it takes all doubt away.
[136:23.67]Well, anyway, take this spell.
[136:25.13]It's a charm I made with the young master in mind.
[136:28.55]Got it.
[136:28.85]Please, offer it to Buddha for his sake.
[136:36.20]Young Lord's bell charm.
[136:37.74]Huh.
[136:58.48]Okay.
[136:58.60]Anything else?
[136:59.10]Huh.
[136:59.36]Alright.
[136:59.96]Now, sprint push off cliff.
[137:01.50]I can talk to that person, too.
[137:34.83]What do you have to say?
[137:40.93]Who is it?
[137:45.65]Is somebody there?
[137:51.64]What if I say nothing?
[137:53.54]Am I just going to be silent protagonist this stream?
[137:57.42]I feel like I should say something.
[138:00.12]Yes.
[138:02.18]That voice.
[138:03.54]No.
[138:04.91]Could it be?
[138:05.87]Sir, my name is Inosuke Nogami, a vassal of the Harada family.
[138:10.10]Do you have any prayer beads?
[138:11.44]Oh, at least I was.
[138:12.98]I ask a favor.
[138:15.07]Might you look in on the old lady in that house?
[138:17.33]Oh, this is the son.
[138:19.51]Her mind is failing.
[138:22.00]She cannot tell one from another.
[138:23.96]I met your mother.
[138:25.14]She gave me a bell.
[138:26.52]She did, did she?
[138:28.78]You have my thanks.
[138:29.68]That bell's troubled her for a long, long time.
[138:33.52]She kept muttering incoherently.
[138:36.64]Something about offering it to Buddha.
[138:40.53]OK.
[138:43.34]So, should I offer it?
[138:50.80]Probably should go back.
[138:58.76]Offer it to Buddha, come back, and then... Yeah, but I need another checkpoint, though.
[139:02.99]That was hell, getting through that.
[139:04.59]That was such a pain in the ass.
[139:05.99]There's so many enemies here.
[139:10.05]Where's the Illusuary Wall?
[139:11.53]To give me a new bonfire.
[139:16.60]There might be one right here.
[139:26.03]Of course, right when I walk down here.
[139:27.11]I can go up, but... Is there like a... Can I do that?
[139:38.62]How do you do that?
[139:50.39]Oh, the ceramics.
[139:51.16]Right, right, right.
[139:51.76]That's how you do... That's a big guy.
[140:02.40]That guy has a bedpost.
[140:08.29]Watch out for the giant guy with the bedpost.
[140:11.61]No, I cannot whistle.
[140:12.41]I don't know how.
[140:14.02]I'm gonna throw a Ceramic over here.
[140:15.76]I have like a thousand of them, might as well use them.
[140:17.30]Ten, you don't see the other zeros.
[140:20.03]Nevermind.
[140:29.07]Alright, so... What's the range on that?
[140:40.80]What's the range on that?
[140:49.90]I'm just gonna pull him.
[140:50.94]Fuck it.
[140:52.96]What, the guy with the bedpost?
[140:53.82]That's a cannon.
[140:54.66]That's a cannon.
[140:55.28]That's like a mortar.
[140:59.82]Oh, now the guy with the mortar knows I exist.
[141:02.81]Wonderful.
[141:10.33]Oh, that's just fantastic.
[141:12.18]That's fantastic.
[141:14.38]Um...
[141:18.67]He doesn't see me over here, right?
[141:21.19]Yes, he does.
[141:22.07]Alright, we gotta move.
[141:25.39]Now.
[141:26.55]I gotta plan.
[141:32.87]Maybe he'll stop?
[141:37.78]I'll take this.
[141:42.75]Sugar, more sugar.
[141:43.73]The high Senpu priest gave this candy to a band of short but adept assassins.
[141:49.77]Suppresses sound and presence for a time, making these harder to detect.
[141:55.13]So it's a stealth candy.
[141:56.85]Bite the candy and take the gachin stance to impart its inhuman benediction.
[142:03.18]Once hired guards, now extensions of the monks will end their quest for undeath.
[142:06.42]So it's a stealth candy.
[142:10.26]Apparently somebody can see me over here.
[142:14.48]I don't know who.
[142:18.54]Who can see me?
[142:19.22]I don't know.
[142:22.90]Okay.
[142:24.64]Let's go.
[142:25.08]I almost just fell off.
[142:32.06]I'm going to grab that tree.
[142:34.22]It's not safe.
[142:35.78]Please.
[142:36.12]Okay, we'll find it.
[142:40.39]I wonder if he gave up shooting.
[142:55.57]I can sneak behind him.
[142:56.71]Nobody else over here, right?
[143:01.24]I'm going for it.
[143:02.62]He's not stupid enough to turn around and just fire the cannon in my face, right?
[143:13.90]Black gunpowder!
[143:15.93]Matero used an alchemical prosthetic tool upgrades, including those of an explosive and occultic nature.
[143:22.40]Even the most mundane form of gunpowder has a wide variety of applications.
[143:31.28]So, gunpowder.
[143:33.60]Let's go ahead and take out the two people in the front door.
[143:36.38]You know, for, like, LOL.
[143:42.38]What you meant to say is just fucking do that and do it again.
[143:58.50]Nice.
[144:01.10]How many healing?
[144:01.63]I don't have any healing left.
[144:02.65]I just have pellets.
[144:04.39]Which is bad.
[144:05.21]Oh, whoa.
[144:09.01]Wait a minute.
[144:09.43]What's that?
[144:10.15]Look at all that!
[144:11.39]Look at all that shit!
[144:12.79]I gotta get over there.
[144:15.38]Um... How do I get the... Can I... Come on.
[144:25.39]Is it the first cookie bug of the game?
[144:27.76]No, are cookie bugs even in this game?
[144:29.40]I don't think they're... those bugs are even in this game.
[144:42.91]Uh... Possession Balloon.
[144:48.23]If one pops this vibrant green balloon, those its water flashes will have a higher chance of obtaining items.
[144:55.16]So it's a magic find.
[144:59.60]Magic find... Two magic find balloons.
[145:09.73]Oh, another item over here.
[145:11.71]Any more?
[145:12.05]Iron?
[145:26.53]Basic reinforcement.
[145:28.99]Sorry.
[145:29.61]Maybe this is like the shards.
[145:31.22]Possibly.
[145:31.74]I have no idea where... I don't even know where the hell I'm going right now.
[145:39.16]What did I do?
[145:39.56]Where did I end up?
[145:41.28]I'm going all the way around the mountain.
[145:46.26]I guess we're gonna keep going this way.
[146:02.57]Whoa!
[146:03.09]Can those rocks fall?
[146:04.87]Is there a better place for me to go from here?
[146:09.27]Can I hug this wall?
[146:23.68]Please!
[146:27.76]Ugh.
[146:41.18]God, I hate when it does that.
[146:42.04]I keep thinking I'm going to fall off.
[146:47.14]Absolutely gorgeous, you know?
[146:48.72]It's a gorgeous game.
[146:49.98]Gorgeous.
[146:59.31]Spider-Man?
[147:01.37]Maybe a Spider-Man scenario?
[147:03.69]I'm going to try!
[147:04.31]Oh!
[147:04.37]That could have been bad.
[147:10.63]I would have lost half my HP.
[147:22.66]It seems so much bigger than any of their previous games.
[147:29.77]It's open, it's huge, there's a lot to explore.
[147:32.71]It's almost overwhelming, because of how big this is.
[147:34.93]And how much you can see.
[147:37.85]But I didn't, there's a lot of people over here, so hold on.
[147:40.29]Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[147:46.43]Thank God.
[147:53.85]It's all the vertical movement, yeah.
[147:56.77]There's a lot of it.
[147:57.50]Alright, let me go back to the town and see what he has to say about this, the bell thing.
[148:09.49]Great Canadian Fuck Club.
[148:10.71]Ten community subs.
[148:12.31]Back at it again.
[148:14.23]With the major community subs.
[148:16.87]Thank you so much, Great Canadian.
[148:23.11]Let's find out what we can do with this.
[148:26.99]What is it?
[148:27.81]Seems to me your battle sense has returned.
[148:30.91]You're more like a shinobi than before.
[148:33.95]If only a little.
[148:35.63]Take this.
[148:39.19]A book of secrets that details a variety of techniques grants the ability to learn shinobi style skills.
[148:47.43]Within this text are the innermost secrets of the shinobi arts, such as attacks performed in the air and hiding one's body to avoid detection.
[148:56.71]What is it?
[148:57.95]Shinobi techniques recorded within are fighting techniques that cannot be performed by samurai.
[149:07.63]Whether you make use of them or not is up to you.
[149:11.39]Shinobi aren't the only ones with their own fighting techniques.
[149:17.69]So now skills.
[149:21.16]Owning an esoteric text of a combat style will allow its skills to be acquired in the sculptor's idol skill menu.
[149:28.20]Each enemy defeated provides skill experience.
[149:30.88]Skill points are acquired once enough experience is gained, which can be spent to unlock skills.
[149:37.26]Some skills can also be learned by obtaining items or defeating enemies.
[149:42.28]So there actually is just a level up bar in the game.
[149:45.02]Harmony Accord, thanks to the five community subs!
[149:48.44]Thank you.
[149:51.20]Subs rolling in.
[149:53.28]This is the... This is... Is this the...
[149:57.09]I don't know.
[149:57.39]I can hear the ringing of a bell chime.
[150:00.87]You mean this old bell?
[150:03.55]An old woman asked me to offer it to Buddha.
[150:06.01]That bell, have you seen it before?
[150:09.21]No, it is unfamiliar.
[150:11.50]It appears the bell disagrees.
[150:13.96]I've seen you... I think it's trying to tell you something.
[150:17.20]What?
[150:17.86]Give it as an offering.
[150:19.72]The kind-faced Buddha near the wall is different from the Buddhas I make.
[150:25.50]It was carved by the hand of the true sculptor.
[150:32.14]So let's see.
[150:32.80]Do I have any new tools?
[150:34.74]I have gunpowder.
[150:35.44]No.
[150:40.56]Another time, pal, and you shall.
[150:44.31]Alright.
[150:44.55]So this is Prey.
[150:51.21]What does this do?
[150:56.54]Close your eyes.
[150:58.98]Hear the bell speak to you.
[151:02.61]DLC area?
[151:16.34]Somebody just said, sort of.
[151:18.44]The bells chime will Ster your thoughts and awaken old memories from their slumber.
[151:33.92]Day one DLC.
[151:38.00]Three years ago.
[151:44.15]This is...
[151:49.49]So wait, am I in like a dream world?
[151:52.35]Dream world.
[152:00.47]Yeah, new skills.
[152:05.15]Oh boy, there's a skill tree.
[152:08.74]Spend skill points in the skill menu.
[152:10.22]New combat styles can be learned through obtaining texts for each style.
[152:15.83]There are three types.
[152:17.39]Combat Arts, Shinobi Martial Arts, and Latent Skills.
[152:22.66]Combat Arts must be equipped to be used, but Shinobi Martial Arts and Latent Skills are always in effect upon being acquired.
[152:31.72]So this is a Combat Art.
[152:34.26]Whirlwind Slash.
[152:42.89]So this is available.
[152:43.63]This is not available.
[152:47.67]counter thrust attacks.
[152:49.97]This is a lot.
[152:50.59]I guess I'm just going to do this.
[152:55.07]Why wouldn't I just get this right now?
[152:59.67]Whirlwind Slash.
[153:03.64]But do I only get a certain amount of these books?
[153:06.16]Or points or something?
[153:12.30]Enables one to counter enemy thrust attacks by stomping down on an enemy's weapon.
[153:17.13]Nearly impossible to perceive the speed of a thrust, but not for the sharp eyes of a shinobi.
[153:24.10]Okay.
[153:28.32]I'm just going to get the first one.
[153:32.06]So how do I do that?
[153:33.54]Maybe I can go back to the training guy?
[153:41.06]I like the idea of hitting multiple people.
[153:48.53]Okay, combat arts are special attack skills based on the strengths of the fighting style they belong to.
[153:53.48]They must be equipped in the equipment menu.
[153:57.88]And can be learned through the skill menu or found in special text.
[154:02.38]So left trigger while holding... Right trigger while holding left trigger is a combat art.
[154:10.75]So let's go put it on.
[154:13.77]You can only have one on at a time.
[154:16.99]Oh, there it is, okay.
[154:20.88]So it's just both at the same time.
[154:28.94]So you can just hold it and bang.
[154:31.26]It doesn't cost anything.
[154:34.12]That's a pretty cool move though.
[154:35.30]That's actually fantastic.
[154:36.86]I'm going to love that.
[154:37.54]I'm going to love it!
[154:40.72]Somebody said play Conqueror's Bad for a day.
[154:49.95]Like, right now?
[154:50.49]I don't think that's gonna happen.
[154:56.70]Hirata Estate.
[155:00.96]Uh, I feel like I probably shouldn't be here right now.
[155:03.80]But, for the sake of just seeing what's here, I'm gonna go over here.
[155:14.47]Can I go up?
[155:15.05]No.
[155:24.06]guy right there.
[155:25.76]I gotta try my new move on somebody.
[155:32.58]Ah, should I throw this at somebody?
[155:34.60]I don't even know how it works.
[155:37.27]Yeah, I'm just starting to barely understand the mechanics of the game.
[155:40.77]Sorry.
[155:41.03]Alright, anybody over there?
[155:52.22]I could probably sneak up on this dude.
[155:56.46]Well, I'm not going to sneak up on that guy.
[155:58.78]Should have paid more attention.
[156:04.01]Dowsing Powder.
[156:05.23]Treating burns.
[156:09.23]Reduces burn damage.
[156:10.99]You put it all over you and it makes you not be burnt.
[156:14.51]Alright, let's go.
[156:19.83]Alright, you're kind of killing me.
[156:29.97]Nice job.
[156:31.51]I'll give you credit.
[156:33.55]You did try to break it.
[156:37.08]WAIT!
[156:38.06]No, it's not?
[156:39.68]My god, my whole body hurts.
[156:48.08]Thank god you can't die by going in the water in this game.
[156:50.70]I'm pressing A instead of Y to pick shit up.
[156:54.12]Look at this thing!
[157:00.15]I don't know.
[157:01.23]Look how big this turtle's neck is.
[157:03.58]No, that's not alive.
[157:04.62]I thought that turtle was alive.
[157:06.40]I was going to say, that is a fucked up looking turtle.
[157:20.77]Can I... I can't...
[157:30.82]Treasure carp scale.
[157:34.56]Wait, this is the cookie bug.
[157:36.22]This is the new bug.
[157:38.20]Alright.
[157:48.93]Bring it to somebody who knows what they're doing and you can... Alright, that's cool.
[157:52.47]So there's a cookie fish now.
[157:55.75]Well, look at that.
[158:01.62]Wouldn't have even come over here if it wasn't for the cookie fish.
[158:08.25]Another one.
[158:10.25]Nice.
[158:11.43]How far can you go?
[158:12.23]Is there an invisible wall?
[158:13.03]Yeah.
[158:14.93]What about the other side?
[158:19.48]I don't think I can make it up there.
[158:33.13]You can't grab that ledge?
[158:34.07]Yes, you can.
[158:35.17]You can't.
[158:35.61]What, are you dumb?
[158:49.00]Did I miss anything over here?
[158:49.84]There's more shit over there, though.
[158:57.71]What, are you dumb?
[159:00.59]Let me get down here first.
[159:04.66]There's, like, pirate boats over here with items.
[159:06.94]Huh?
[159:07.36]Who?
[159:08.84]Oh, you.
[159:09.88]Alright, fine.
[159:10.26]Come down here.
[159:10.62]I'll kill you in two seconds.
[159:14.64]Are you gonna come over here, or... You're not gonna aggro everyone by doing this, right?
[159:17.98]That'd be really bad.
[159:21.24]Please don't.
[159:25.69]He lost me.
[159:26.19]Good.
[159:33.19]That's a big animal.
[159:37.02]Is this a regular dog?
[159:37.76]This is a regular dog.
[159:40.82]This guy's still finding me.
[159:45.64]There's no fashion, Sekiro.
[159:52.39]Well, that's unfortunate.
[159:53.43]Another one of these... ...magic find items.
[160:06.28]I'm intrigued to go check over here.
[160:07.70]Can't get up there?
[160:14.67]No?
[160:20.99]Could you effectively just go all the way around and skip the whole thing?
[160:31.60]Another coin purse.
[160:33.50]Ooh!
[160:34.48]Secret fish.
[160:39.30]No, no!
[160:39.70]Got it.
[160:45.20]That was brutal.
[160:47.62]Was the fish just talking to me?
[160:57.37]Why?
[161:00.51]What?
[161:09.96]Oh, creepy.
[161:22.47]Purchase items with scales.
[161:26.53]Mask fragment.
[161:29.91]Withered red gourd.
[161:33.11]Curved withered red gourd filled with medicinal water.
[161:36.09]The gourd's medicine fulfills upon rest.
[161:39.81]Reduces burn buildup and slightly increases burn resistance.
[161:42.80]It cannot heal the burn status... Where's Divine Grass?
[161:51.41]So this is a full heal.
[161:55.25]So...
[162:06.64]This is a consumable, though.
[162:08.24]It's a scale to eat this, and it's gone.
[162:16.45]The original must have been broken into several pieces, and this fragment appears to be the right side of the mask.
[162:25.82]So this is a combat art, Floating Passage.
[162:29.14]Unleash attacks in a flowing, dance-like form, overwhelming enemies in a furor of graceful aggression.
[162:42.31]What does the mask do?
[162:43.33]I have no idea.
[162:52.08]No Wikipedia to help us.
[162:53.18]We just gotta play.
[163:01.05]That's really cool, though.
[163:01.77]What a cool character.
[163:07.91]Uh, fish?
[163:08.85]What was it?
[163:12.19]I just got... What is it?
[163:13.78]Did I lose my opportunity?
[163:16.82]I gotta get out of the water.
[163:29.50]Who is aggroing to me?
[163:41.38]Let's get up here.
[163:42.80]No, I can't.
[163:51.50]There he is.
[163:51.92]There he is, dude.
[163:55.90]Come here.
[163:56.42]Come on.
[163:59.07]No!
[163:59.83]Damn it!
[164:02.45]I gotta get up here and just wait.
[164:11.79]Come on.
[164:14.69]I need to kill you.
[164:15.71]You gotta come on.
[164:20.05]Fishing quest, I know, really.
[164:25.17]There it is.
[164:32.08]He's not at the surface, though.
[164:36.36]I think he used to actually pop up, because I can't really hit him.
[164:46.93]Try the shuriken.
[164:47.65]That's a good idea.
[164:48.69]Let's see.
[164:50.01]Because he's deep down there.
[165:00.20]It just makes him go real fast.
[165:01.68]I might just have to watch and wait for him to get stuck.
[165:12.85]Hopefully he comes back.
[165:17.33]It seems like you have to come up a little higher to the surface.
[165:28.73]Back?
[165:33.06]Okay.
[165:33.46]Let's just wait.
[165:36.60]It gets a little closer.
[165:37.24]We're going to leap out and smash it.
[165:47.69]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[165:50.63]Wait.
[165:50.83]What?
[165:54.90]What do you want?
[166:09.75]Just scream and charge him.
[166:11.09]That's not going to work.
[166:12.01]Come to London.
[166:16.23]I've always wanted to go to Europe.
[166:19.87]I'm not sure who's gonna get up.
[166:26.12]He's gonna be right here.
[166:26.70]Okay, here we go, here we go.
[166:28.40]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[166:32.05]Fuck no!
[166:32.89]What?
[166:35.77]How do I spin down?
[166:37.49]I couldn't get it.
[166:45.34]It's almost like, see I'm slashing this way?
[166:48.47]I don't think you can do that.
[166:53.39]There's a way I can swing down.
[166:56.15]Maybe like that.
[166:59.17]We need to get the rod.
[167:00.27]I don't buy that.
[167:02.57]Let me try doing that combat art, too.
[167:15.20]Come on, I have to catch this fish.
[167:16.90]It's going to drive me crazy.
[167:17.80]There he is.
[167:18.16]Alright, I'm going to do the combat R2.
[167:27.79]I can't even see him.
[167:28.95]I might have to just wait a little longer.
[167:30.31]Just wait even longer.
[167:31.43]As he goes by here, he starts to come up a little bit.
[167:45.77]This is just a fishing stream.
[167:47.13]At the moment, yeah.
[167:50.59]Alright.
[167:51.77]Here we go.
[167:54.57]This is what happened last time.
[167:55.65]He came up a little.
[167:59.13]Throw your sword at him.
[168:00.17]Why do I just don't move?
[168:07.96]Where'd it go?
[168:12.90]Where'd it go?
[168:13.32]What?
[168:15.34]What?
[168:21.41]Oh shit, how did he go behind me?
[168:27.60]Shallow water.
[168:30.00]Fuck it, I'm going for it.
[168:33.10]Got him.
[168:34.30]Nice.
[168:34.58]Alright, cool.
[168:37.90]I feel complete.
[168:45.92]Shut up, Oscar.
[168:49.42]There might be another one.
[168:54.84]Might as well check, right?
[168:55.72]I don't see any more.
[169:10.07]There was one under here.
[169:11.11]I need to get the Great Rod.
[169:14.29]There is no Great Rod.
[169:15.45]Get the Great Rod.
[169:22.55]That's a lot of dogs up there.
[169:23.99]I think I'm going to just pull this guy.
[169:26.04]No, how am I going to effectively do this?
[169:27.62]I've got to go around.
[169:28.26]I think I've got three dogs with me.
[169:34.74]Have I thought about visiting Singapore?
[169:39.06]I want to go everywhere, but I want to turn like 40 first.
[169:43.38]You know, I want to be one of those boomers that just travels the world when he's like 45.
[169:46.14]Hold on.
[169:59.81]Guy on the bridge.
[170:00.41]The guy with the three dogs is right up here.
[170:06.95]Maybe fighting's not the answer sometimes.
[170:16.91]I can't grab that from here?
[170:19.59]Okay, I'm gonna... Here's the plan.
[170:20.69]Ready?
[170:20.89]I'm gonna go in and I'm gonna do the weapon art to all the dogs at the same time.
[170:25.87]Nobody sees me yet.
[170:41.82]Perfect.
[170:44.46]Oh shit, that's the burn meter.
[170:47.48]He got me with the burn, really.
[170:49.90]I'm burning now.
[170:51.40]Fuck.
[170:52.18]Yeah, I thought... I thought... I thought... Oh, I'm so mad about that.
[171:01.76]Yeah, the resistance gauge becomes inflicted.
[171:03.70]There are two items which suppress the gauge and cure and I'm on fire.
[171:10.51]I don't think I can get rid of this until... How long does this last?
[171:14.95]I dodged into every single one of those somehow.
[171:17.76]It's actually not that bad.
[171:25.64]Enemies doused in oil easily set alight, causing them to take additional vitality damage from fire attacks.
[171:31.34]So, oil, and they burn.
[171:34.06]You got it.
[171:36.82]Nah.
[171:38.03]Let me just get rid of this guy too.
[171:50.32]I love games where stopping and dropping actually works.
[171:53.28]Yeah.
[171:54.70]I mean, it is pretty cool.
[172:02.22]Come on.
[172:07.25]Nothing else?
[172:10.15]I completely forgot this is almost a secondary area that I don't have to be in right now.
[172:17.79]My brain just... This is the next part of the game in my brain.
[172:20.66]Why did I press down?
[172:24.01]Maybe it is.
[172:24.41]I don't know.
[172:35.29]Let's take a rest.
[172:46.71]I'm good.
[172:47.11]15 out of 15.
[172:50.09]More ceramic shards.
[172:53.67]Alright.
[172:56.27]Is he screaming to let everybody in?
[172:59.28]Or... That's a big yell, right?
[173:01.12]Okay.
[173:01.46]Well, whatever.
[173:01.90]Just come over here.
[173:04.67]Is he opening the door?
[173:06.77]That door... This can't open.
[173:20.32]They just know that something's going on over here.
[173:21.58]They can't do anything about it, though.
[173:23.60]I'm fine with that.
[173:26.16]Alright, let's get out.
[173:32.83]Alright, any enemies down here?
[173:36.21]No.
[173:36.61]Let's just check.
[173:40.83]No?
[173:41.85]Ladder.
[173:44.65]Hug wall.
[173:48.99]Just an item on a tree.
[173:50.71]Ooh, thanks.
[173:51.21]I don't even know what it was.
[173:53.21]What the hell was it?
[174:04.38]You are so infected.
[174:07.10]What?
[174:09.52]You mean me in real life?
[174:10.66]I would agree with you.
[174:11.36]Something's wrong with me.
[174:13.52]There's more sugar.
[174:16.32]So this is, you take less damage.
[174:18.04]This is just the damage candy.
[174:20.82]Three.
[174:21.12]Okay, it's in storage.
[174:24.30]I need to save those for bosses.
[174:25.60]I'm not taking those during regular encounters.
[174:27.33]Cool.
[174:34.59]No one for me to jump.
[174:43.16]Only point of entry is up here.
[174:46.89]So, is there anyone I can... What about that way?
[174:51.67]Ooh.
[174:54.47]Um... Let's be easy.
[174:56.83]Let's be easy, easy, easy.
[175:01.90]Can I e-drop?
[175:03.96]Do these guys talk to each other?
[175:07.52]Who's more dangerous?
[175:08.22]I don't know.
[175:20.56]Got the bow.
[175:21.72]Somebody's looking at me.
[175:32.25]I left my favorite YouTuber streamer.
[175:34.09]I think it's streamer now.
[175:38.27]Almost exclusively.
[175:42.25]Doesn't open from this side.
[175:46.53]For now.
[175:48.77]Stream-tuber.
[175:51.55]Um... Three, guy with the burn.
[175:54.89]That looks like a shortcut.
[175:58.88]I wonder... Let's go up this way.
[176:05.82]Can I climb there?
[176:06.65]I'll go over this way, let's go.
[176:09.69]Watch this, ready?
[176:12.33]This is gonna be so cool.
[176:16.71]Nevermind.
[176:25.66]More sugar.
[176:30.58]Boost attack power.
[176:33.48]So this is a... The fighting... The red sugar is the fight sugar.
[176:37.51]Wait, what's that?
[176:44.79]Three people.
[176:46.85]Ah, easy.
[176:48.91]I'm gonna climb up there.
[176:50.31]Come on, give me a point of access.
[176:56.50]Got no access right there to climb?
[177:01.89]Come on.
[177:02.93]How?
[177:03.73]There's gotta be something I can jump up to.
[177:09.02]Not even the tree?
[177:09.70]You're killing me.
[177:24.57]I don't know what I'm doing right now, but it's stupid whatever it is.
[177:27.17]I was just... Trying to find a place to grapple.
[177:48.73]I can't get on this house.
[177:51.08]I thought I could.
[177:51.64]Alright, let's just talk.
[177:53.69]Sometimes you just gotta go in.
[177:54.79]Okay.
[177:55.53]Good job to this guy.
[178:19.48]You're broken, that's great.
[178:23.06]That was a Smash Brothers sound effect?
[178:24.84]I don't even know what you're talking about.
[178:38.35]Some pellets, good.
[178:40.71]That'll help.
[178:44.63]They were dogs, though.
[178:55.64]Thought I could get over there.
[178:56.46]Thought I could be cheeky about that.
[179:09.29]Whoa!
[179:09.91]I was stuck on something there.
[179:13.49]Did that guy just say, wuzzah?
[179:15.43]Like the old Budweiser commercial?
[179:30.43]Ooh, that hurts.
[179:32.64]Alright.
[179:34.56]Oh, no, no, no.
[179:35.84]Bad.
[179:36.36]Very bad.
[179:48.15]Relax.
[179:48.47]This guy has a bow and arrow or something over here.
[180:00.03]I gotta go.
[180:00.71]I'm back on top of the house, please.
[180:03.23]Actually, maybe not.
[180:03.87]That's probably bad.
[180:04.63]I don't know.
[180:07.15]I need to get the item in here.
[180:08.20]Oh, come on.
[180:10.82]With this accuracy.
[180:11.76]Come on.
[180:25.41]I'm talking on the roof.
[180:26.81]Alright.
[180:28.61]Fuck this guy.
[180:54.96]Where are you locking on, game?
[180:56.54]Holy shit, a lot of people.
[181:13.20]Easy.
[181:14.32]Fuck.
[181:16.56]I was trying to do the art.
[181:33.84]Damn it, I didn't time it right.
[181:40.12]That guy was shit-faced.
[181:43.40]Yeah, he was pretty drunk.
[181:47.92]Although, I'm kind of hurting for health here.
[181:58.39]Just one more guy, I think.
[182:07.84]I feel bad for that guy, I mean, but still, sometimes you gotta... I hear another dog somewhere.
[182:21.37]It's the burn powder.
[182:24.29]In this room?
[182:26.47]No.
[182:32.13]Okay, there we go.
[182:32.65]Pellet.
[182:33.95]Any more items?
[182:34.79]Couple here.
[182:35.27]This is the money pellet.
[182:39.72]Flame barrel.
[182:40.70]An iron barrel that spews fire.
[182:42.40]Ooh!
[182:43.94]A new prosthetic.
[182:46.94]It's difficult to control the rage-filled red eyes with the power of man alone.
[182:52.24]A fire-based weapon could be a means of resisting them.
[182:55.36]They're said to fear fire above all else.
[183:02.61]Well, I now have a new toy to play with.
[183:13.11]I'm gonna heal.
[183:19.72]There's another item over here.
[183:20.86]I haven't used this once.
[183:25.52]I'm gonna just fucking see what it does.
[183:28.31]Every time I play one of these games, I just never use the items that they give me.
[183:32.35]And I end up with a thousand of them in my inventory.
[183:34.30]Alright, keep going.
[183:43.14]Well, let's see what it does.
[183:45.48]Looks like it distracts.
[183:47.08]Alright, that's actually really good.
[183:48.24]That's phenomenal, actually.
[184:03.69]Oh.
[184:06.43]That's the sun?
[184:06.87]The shinobi axe.
[184:34.00]For a second, I thought you said, like, hug him.
[184:35.80]Oh, okay.
[184:38.38]Sorry that you died.
[184:39.32]See anything?
[184:49.98]Oh, I do.
[184:55.22]Will he see me if I pop out here?
[184:56.56]What is that?
[184:58.64]Oh, he's trapped.
[184:59.89]Okay.
[185:02.36]I can hear you whispering in there.
[185:04.71]If you don't surrender peaceably now, you're going to regret it later.
[185:08.51]Hey, can you hear me?
[185:09.85]Hey!
[185:10.41]Alright, so something going on in there.
[185:13.73]Hey, open up.
[185:15.30]I can hear you.
[185:15.92]Hey!
[185:17.06]I'm going to kill these guys.
[185:17.90]Uh...
[185:27.79]Shit, there's more stuff over here, too.
[185:29.29]There's an NPC over there.
[185:30.47]Alright, wait.
[185:32.15]Ah.
[185:33.95]Let me get the- There's an item this way.
[185:35.15]Let me just get up there and pick it up, whatever it is.
[185:47.28]Chicken.
[185:53.30]Alright.
[185:54.50]Another sugar.
[185:57.26]So this reduces posture damage taken.
[185:59.08]Look at all these candies.
[186:09.89]Ah, hey, look at that.
[186:12.27]I did it.
[186:12.77]I opened up the shortcut.
[186:17.95]Remember this?
[186:18.57]Uh-huh.
[186:23.79]Cool.
[186:30.80]I remember.
[186:34.58]Let's go refill our stuff.
[186:40.38]I also kind of want to... I want to go see what this new toy is.
[186:58.41]New toy?
[186:59.01]Yeah.
[187:04.82]So, you're back.
[187:06.46]Was that a dream?
[187:09.02]Or was it real?
[187:13.70]Whether it was a dream or it was reality... I have no idea.
[187:17.02]What the hell are you talking about?
[187:18.50]You've been smoking?
[187:19.16]There is one thing I can tell you.
[187:21.70]You've been asleep over there for like 40 minutes.
[187:23.72]...awaken old memories within you.
[187:26.48]What you felt.
[187:27.77]What you remembered.
[187:29.29]That is what it all depends upon.
[187:31.55]I'm not sure if what I saw is what truly happened.
[187:35.17]That's how it works.
[187:38.15]That's how you go lucid, man.
[187:40.96]Hey, next time you're in that zone, look in a mirror to get even more lucid.
[187:46.56]Flip a couple of light switches.
[187:47.78]Look at a clock.
[187:48.84]You'll get deeper into lucidity.
[187:56.81]Actually, by the way, don't ever look at a mirror if you're in a dream.
[188:00.13]It's terrifying.
[188:01.33]You look like the Scream monster.
[188:02.74]The guy from Scream with the Scream mask on.
[188:04.40]It's horrible.
[188:05.82]Your brain doesn't understand how to decipher a mirror if you're in a dream.
[188:10.20]Try it if you want to be scared.
[188:15.54]Alright.
[188:16.38]Deals fire damage to enemies in a short-range blast while burning.
[188:22.01]So, let's create it.
[188:25.19]I can have three of these, right?
[188:32.86]Never seen a mirror in your dream?
[188:34.18]I'm telling you, if you want to scare the shit out of yourself, if you ever find yourself lucid in a dream, go look in a mirror.
[188:44.29]You will probably immediately wake up because it's going to be a horror movie.
[188:48.45]Okay, let's see.
[188:51.97]Let's equip it.
[188:55.47]So this costs three spirit emblems.
[188:59.33]Whoa.
[189:02.54]That's cool.
[189:04.16]I kind of want to just try it.
[189:11.26]It's a cool way to switch.
[189:16.19]Alright.
[189:17.71]Back to it.
[189:21.89]Let's rest up.
[189:29.12]Dermalucid.
[189:29.54]Dermalucid.
[189:32.00]No.
[189:33.60]What about skills?
[189:34.38]Okay, I can do... Wait a minute.
[189:38.98]Mid-air deflection.
[189:41.73]Allows one to guard against or deflect enemy attacks in mid-air.
[189:49.71]That sounds pretty great.
[189:50.79]What's this one?
[189:54.03]A shinobi's karma body.
[189:59.66]Max spirit emblems.
[190:03.66]Interesting.
[190:06.20]What about down here?
[190:06.88]Let me look at what some of these do.
[190:09.52]That's cool.
[190:13.42]Run and slide.
[190:14.32]Allows one to slide into a crouch position while sprinting.
[190:18.30]Sprint through an area and slide into cover or otherwise out of view.
[190:22.13]Easily deceives an enemy's eyes.
[190:26.33]Reduces an enemy's ability to perceive those who are in stealth.
[190:31.24]I kind of like being able to deflect in the air.
[190:34.82]But... I'm gonna hold on.
[190:37.32]Not yet.
[190:47.08]Am I still in Anor Londo?
[190:49.62]Uh... I don't know how you could classify this area.
[190:57.31]You could classify this area as... I'm not sure.
[191:02.90]I'm going to try this move, though.
[191:05.10]Ready?
[191:07.08]Let's see what it does.
[191:08.28]Short range, right?
[191:14.45]So, it's kind of just like a blast.
[191:21.07]That's a pretty long windup, too.
[191:22.95]Okay.
[191:33.24]You've got to be real close.
[191:35.58]It's a dodge.
[191:37.41]And then from the dodge, you've got to be ready to go immediately.
[191:40.13]Alright, let's skip this.
[191:50.30]He tried to backstab.
[191:51.50]Yeah, I did.
[191:52.44]You're right.
[191:55.95]Alright, it's gonna go through the door.
[191:57.87]That's now open.
[191:58.63]I can just probably sneak around here, right?
[192:01.27]Don't need to fight anything.
[192:04.85]There's your pyromancy, yeah?
[192:07.48]Pretty much.
[192:10.54]I can't get there from here.
[192:11.82]Come on.
[192:15.32]Come on!
[192:16.36]It's right there!
[192:17.28]I can't reach the roof here.
[192:20.57]What are you thinking?
[192:22.47]Wait, yes I can.
[192:25.23]Of course I can.
[192:28.05]game doesn't suck what do you know we carry on alright there was an npc there's a chicken well I'm gonna go over here because there's an item
[193:11.49]I bumped into everything in his house he's just kind of standing there going well you know somebody fucked up my house destroyed all my stuff sucks I don't know what the hell he's looking at hey
[193:49.16]Wait, you can come this way?
[193:57.87]I somehow instinctively, for no reason, started to try to attack with R1.
[194:03.69]Which... That's a long time ago.
[194:11.50]You are hard to parry.
[194:12.38]Oh, Jesus.
[194:14.92]Oh, my lord, where's God?
[194:20.28]Come on!
[194:23.80]Hey-ya!
[194:25.80]Hey-ya!
[194:41.63]Fuck me.
[194:51.84]I feel like trapped in the corner over here.
[194:54.21]With two different elevations, you know what I mean?
[194:56.11]Like, boom, boom.
[194:59.33]Oh, fuck off game.
[195:26.14]He's PG.
[195:28.50]No, not right now.
[195:39.42]What's in here?
[195:39.90]Ooh, a secret.
[195:44.95]There's the axe.
[195:47.75]Fuck off game means game sucks.
[195:49.77]No.
[195:51.45]It means fuck off for that moment.
[195:53.09]I found the axe.
[195:54.67]It's another tool.
[195:57.23]Less for cutting and more for breaking things with its weight.
[196:00.03]Once the favorite weapon of a shinobi known as the Bounding Monkey of the Sunken Valley, it was lost along with his left arm.
[196:09.61]Okay, so there's another two tools here.
[196:11.33]That's pretty cool.
[196:18.78]Wasn't there somebody just walking over here looking at this?
[196:22.36]It was an NPC.
[196:25.08]Maybe not.
[196:28.15]Let's get rid of the chicken.
[196:38.93]If I die to this chicken, I swear to God.
[196:47.20]You killed my brother!
[196:49.64]Don't make jokes here, because I actually could die.
[196:52.72]Oh no.
[196:54.86]Oh god damn it, please.
[196:56.41]Please not the chicken.
[196:57.85]Please.
[197:11.39]Alright.
[197:14.77]There's another one in there.
[197:16.55]That's king chicken.
[197:23.15]Do they live in this house?
[197:27.73]Stop!
[197:28.39]You violated the law!
[197:32.36]Can I stealth kill this chicken?
[197:38.64]Come on, let me stealth kill him.
[197:40.72]No!
[197:41.28]Alright, something has to be in this house.
[197:51.96]Why would this be here?
[197:58.21]There's nothing in the chicken house.
[198:02.29]Really?
[198:04.67]Yes, there is.
[198:08.46]More sugar.
[198:20.53]What about the people that were back here?
[198:21.83]Um, I think they're still here.
[198:26.86]Yeah, see?
[198:27.48]Okay.
[198:28.04]So that was, this is the way to go to progress.
[198:30.78]It's just straight through.
[198:31.74]I cleaned up everything.
[198:32.64]Now, speaking of cleaning, let's clean up some braid matter off of our sword.
[198:44.63]Why, what is that lit up for?
[198:58.14]Is that Liam Neeson?
[198:59.24]He's out there.
[199:01.66]He's highly skilled.
[199:03.34]Just let me do one more taken.
[199:05.66]Just one more.
[199:07.70]I swear that'll be it.
[199:28.07]We can put it in feudal Japan.
[199:31.77]Please write the script.
[199:33.05]Please.
[199:34.51]Yes.
[199:34.75]We got a blood-borne window NPC.
[199:36.13]Hey.
[199:59.85]You, you're the young master's shinobi.
[200:03.43]Yes.
[200:04.47]What good are you?
[200:06.73]Wait, tell me you didn't believe that the timing of their attack was perfect.
[200:10.68]Yes, I hope.
[200:12.30]I would love if you heard, like, .
[200:19.61]And then it made like the soul collection noise, that like .
[200:27.44]I hope you die twice.
[200:29.62]I hope you die twice.
[200:39.86]Well, let's see what's going on over here.
[200:45.37]Who are you?
[200:46.17]I'm not a thief.
[200:47.69]Oh, okay.
[201:12.55]Powerful antidote concocted by the Sunken Valley Clan.
[201:16.47]Heal status poison and temporarily increases poison resistance.
[201:21.32]Okay.
[201:23.12]So it's a poison heal.
[201:25.66]Thank you.
[201:26.06]Maybe we'll need it later.
[201:27.84]Anything else?
[201:28.22]May the force be with you.
[201:29.32]You as well.
[201:29.78]So everyone's kind of just locked away right now.
[201:45.30]And may the force be with you.
[201:46.58]And also with you.
[201:48.72]Can I open the door?
[201:50.18]Will that alert the horde?
[201:51.74]Oh, wait.
[201:53.28]Right, they're just standing out there.
[201:55.60]He can just hear me.
[201:57.24]I think I heard something behind this door.
[202:00.54]Maybe.
[202:00.94]Alright, let's go for a drop-down kill.
[202:09.78]Get the big guy first, I'd say.
[202:13.07]Yeah, big guy first.
[202:33.24]I can't do that with a cold.
[202:34.10]I was doing fucks.
[202:35.60]I'm going to say this way.
[202:48.18]No, you just got to... No.
[202:51.31]No, no, no, no.
[202:54.39]Come on.
[202:57.03]Just one at a time.
[202:58.15]Let me just throw... I'm gonna... Come here.
[203:05.11]On the back.
[203:06.83]Bring it on.
[203:16.75]Can you deflect that?
[203:17.87]I haven't even attempted to.
[203:18.88]Of course you can.
[203:21.14]It does burn you, though.
[203:30.61]Alright.
[203:35.57]This dude's got a shield.
[203:37.37]How do you break shields?
[203:46.46]Come on down the stairs.
[203:48.82]One shield at a time.
[203:51.22]Please.
[203:51.52]You're so slow.
[203:59.78]You're so slow!
[204:01.51]No, look, he's already down here!
[204:02.85]What an idiot.
[204:11.29]He's almost broken, just... Really?
[204:15.96]I can't... Fine, fuck it.
[204:28.19]Oh my god!
[204:52.85]No!
[204:53.37]Why do you have so much reach?
[204:58.12]What am I supposed to do against this guy?
[205:01.60]Um... I have to dodge around him and hit him in the back, probably?
[205:08.90]Deflect and then break it eventually?
[205:10.36]I'm gonna lose to this idiot.
[205:15.78]I think I just got hurt by stepping on a piece of metal.
[205:23.28]It's a big thrust.
[205:29.83]Little push.
[205:30.57]That hurts a lot.
[205:32.54]I feel like there's a way easier way to do this.
[205:35.40]Alright, yeah, just gotta wait till they go and then just get out of the way.
[205:51.93]Come on, do something!
[205:59.02]One of you do something!
[206:00.56]Before I go mad!
[206:17.61]Of course it does!
[206:19.65]Hey, let's do a puppet show for him!
[206:26.89]Fuck you!
[206:38.45]He killed me again.
[206:39.25]I swear to fucking God.
[206:44.63]Burn!
[206:53.66]He's jumping.
[206:58.42]He blocks it.
[207:03.36]What the fuck?
[207:08.76]What?
[207:18.07]Unseen aid.
[207:23.19]I have to use the axe that I just got.
[207:26.17]Oh, I can't even break.
[207:31.92]Half of skill, experience, and scent are lost upon death, but there is a way to avoid this on rare occasions.
[207:39.83]Through the unseen aid of gods and Buddha, one may be spared this loss.
[207:44.99]The chances of receiving unseen aid can be seen in the pause menu.
[207:51.79]So I have to go get the dumb axe to break the shield.
[207:56.23]Otherwise they just do a puppet show for five minutes.
[208:03.07]So wait a minute.
[208:10.33]Okay, acquired skills, right?
[208:14.32]Unseen 8.
[208:14.88]So there's a 30% chance that when you die twice, you get to come back without losing anything.
[208:19.22]So I didn't lose anything.
[208:20.00]Alright.
[208:24.92]Let me go put on the mandatory item.
[208:36.89]You just lost a lot of respect.
[208:44.30]Don't call him Pinshield.
[208:46.12]Look, how was I supposed to... I gotta, like, put his axe on.
[208:57.08]One strike can easily turn a wooden shield into splinters.
[209:02.37]Ugh.
[209:05.27]That's such dog shit.
[209:09.60]What?
[209:12.61]A book of secrets that details a variety of techniques for use of shinobi prosthetic.
[209:23.68]Grants the ability to learn prosthetic-style skills.
[209:26.20]Okay.
[209:26.36]Okay.
[209:26.46]Thanks for everything.
[209:58.82]Wait, don't just skip it.
[210:01.38]So it's two emblem to do it.
[210:03.38]Big strike breaks shields.
[210:10.13]Very cool.
[210:10.67]Let's get it on there.
[210:14.67]I'm ready.
[210:15.27]I'm ready to go and fight the enemy.
[210:26.55]But first, let's see.
[210:28.21]I have two points.
[210:30.60]There's another Skeletory Prosthetic Arts.
[210:34.52]A Shinobi Martial Art that allows one to perform a forward-dashing sword slice after using a certain prosthetic tools.
[210:41.31]Allowing one to close distance on enemies instantly.
[210:46.15]Ooh.
[210:47.55]So you can throw a shuriken and then dive in.
[210:53.92]That sounds really great, actually.
[210:57.92]Uses the grappling hook to launch oneself at an enemy and use that momentum to perform a rolling sword attack.
[211:05.37]Ugh.
[211:07.77]That sounds actually really fun.
[211:15.56]I mean, that's the ability to grapple into and do the Spider-Man move to people.
[211:34.76]I'm doing it.
[211:36.84]What does that open up here?
[211:38.62]Nightjar Slash.
[211:42.14]Spinning leap attack that can quickly close or create distance from foes.
[211:47.86]Use the weight of the massive shuriken to add force to the blow.
[211:52.62]So you just leap forward.
[211:54.62]What's this one?
[211:58.50]The healing effects of recovery items.
[212:00.63]That's almost unnecessary in these games.
[212:13.50]I'm ready.
[212:19.26]Necessary, yeah.
[212:26.91]Alright, let's go.
[212:30.75]Skip this bullshit.
[212:44.74]Get to the shield guys Break their shields Break their necks Doesn't matter to me
[213:16.18]Bring it on.
[213:19.84]Do something!
[213:20.46]What?
[213:20.88]Okay, good.
[213:22.02]Look at that.
[213:22.66]Already done.
[213:24.46]I was pressing the wrong button.
[213:27.30]It was that simple.
[213:34.58]Alright.
[213:36.92]Yay.
[213:38.30]I'm very happy now.
[213:39.30]Very happy.
[213:40.77]Happier than I've ever been.
[213:55.51]I can go to that tree.
[213:57.11]But for what?
[213:59.75]I wonder.
[214:03.07]Is this kind of just here for no reason?
[214:12.03]Kind of.
[214:17.47]You can swim.
[214:18.44]Yeah, I know you can swim, but...
[214:26.90]Let's just see.
[214:34.86]I'm not, I'm not rushing through it, you know.
[214:36.83]Let's just take a look.
[214:40.53]Anybody down here?
[214:46.13]The goal is not to get to the end as fast as possible.
[214:48.39]The goal is to enjoy the experience.
[214:51.23]So let's just see if there's anyone over here.
[214:52.53]Okay, there is.
[214:55.03]What was that?
[215:02.15]Scale?
[215:05.39]No, that's just an angry fish.
[215:08.87]No scale.
[215:09.21]Alright, well... Is this just a mad fish?
[215:16.97]Guess there's nothing over here.
[215:22.39]There's a tree here, though.
[215:28.22]What would this be here for?
[215:38.48]I have two.
[216:07.47]There's somebody in here.
[216:08.87]Can I eavesdrop on this person?
[216:14.24]Come on.
[216:16.10]Come on, I'm right here.
[216:18.26]Really?
[216:20.10]Are you just weirdly pushed against the wall where I can't do this?
[216:24.08]Yeah, if anyone's gonna get out, their only choice is to use this cave.
[216:33.84]This cave.
[216:34.64]This is the way to get out.
[216:37.42]I would love if this guy ran.
[216:52.45]What the fuck, there's another guy in here!
[216:55.83]Holy shit, I didn't know there were this many people!
[216:58.37]Only two people were talking!
[217:03.20]Oh, this is bad news now.
[217:05.00]Oh, it's so slow.
[217:24.06]Guy with the bow gotta go now.
[217:32.45]That's so important.
[217:41.30]It's so hard to time that in a game that's a thousand miles per hour in fighting.
[217:48.36]Watching the guy slowly swing his fucking stick at you.
[217:59.18]Dick.
[218:05.58]Why are these two left?
[218:33.87]My god.
[218:41.11]It's like he's in slow motion.
[218:44.45]Where am I going?
[219:03.28]Alright, there's a wizard down here.
[219:09.05]Why is there a wizard over here?
[219:11.23]I don't know what to do about this.
[219:12.47]Should I fight the wizard?
[219:14.07]That's a thrust.
[219:28.61]Holy shit, I'm gonna die.
[219:39.83]Wow!
[219:46.73]He just stabbed me four fucking times in a row.
[219:52.57]Holy shit, this guy's insane.
[220:20.20]Did I just get a scripted wizard death?
[220:40.49]So, you're awake.
[220:49.28]Your death is not your fate.
[220:52.78]Just yet.
[220:56.18]He died twice.
[220:57.14]Game over.
[221:02.02]Brought Essence.
[221:04.26]Somewhere a pained cough rings out continuously.
[221:07.82]The man who coughs zealously sculpts statues of Buddha to avoid being consumed by the building flames.
[221:14.96]Owning this item reduces one's chance of receiving unseen aid.
[221:22.18]Rot Essence, Timid Mane.
[221:25.43]So wait, they're like dying?
[221:26.85]The more Rot Essence a wolf has, the lower the chance of receiving Unseen Aid.
[221:32.69]Okay.
[221:56.58]The more that I die, the more they die.
[222:00.00]That's interesting.
[222:00.90]I got so shit on by that guy.
[222:27.77]He just attacked so many times in a row.
[222:34.35]Have you seen the sculptor lately?
[222:36.33]Yes.
[222:37.74]He's... All I know is what Dogen told me long ago.
[222:41.80]That the dragon's heritage can bestow the power of resurrection.
[222:45.88]However, it is not any ordinary power.
[222:48.60]It kills everybody else.
[222:50.35]It leads to stagnation, which will eventually reach a point where it overflows.
[222:57.15]This causes those who do not have the power to become sick.
[223:01.39]A disease known as dragon rot.
[223:04.13]He knew much about it, but even so, he was unable to do a cure.
[223:10.27]Forgive me.
[223:11.25]Is there a way to treat this dragon rot?
[223:13.95]I do not know.
[223:15.58]However, it must be stopped.
[223:18.56]I am unsure.
[223:20.34]But the first step is to look through my mentor's research.
[223:24.22]and see if I can discover a way thank you just don't die easy goodbye I'm gonna lose I'm gonna have zero dollars by the end of this playthrough I bet you anything I bet you I have five cents when this is all said and done
[223:50.39]Alright, I feel like I probably shouldn't... I need to go down and fight the wizard again.
[223:53.61]I mean, how am I gonna just not have that happen?
[223:58.15]Ugh.
[223:59.99]Shit.
[224:00.31]I'll try it again.
[224:28.82]Oh, I have Dragon Rot.
[224:41.83]Let's keep moving.
[224:50.19]Nice knowing you.
[224:57.51]Same two idiots.
[225:07.87]OK, back where I was before.
[225:09.41]I'm going to get embarrassed again here.
[225:11.67]Alright, hold on.
[225:18.68]I'm going to grab this.
[225:28.99]Should I go that way?
[225:29.71]I feel like I have to get my revenge.
[225:35.13]Even if it means killing every single person in the town by dragon rod.
[225:38.91]I'm gonna die like 30 times here.
[225:40.83]I have to get my revenge on this guy.
[225:49.70]God damn it.
[225:53.22]I don't even know where the hell that was.
[225:58.85]Where the fuck was that?
[225:59.81]I don't even remember.
[226:05.67]Is it down here?
[226:06.40]Yeah.
[226:08.92]No, it wasn't.
[226:14.94]No, yeah, it was.
[226:15.66]Okay.
[226:18.24]Alright, alright, alright.
[226:19.26]This time, don't fuck it all up.
[226:24.89]Forget about... See, I came in here with a bunch of issues.
[226:31.61]Stealth kill this guy, and then go get the wizard.
[226:35.48]Who can see me?
[226:37.18]That makes no- Who is even looking at me?
[226:38.48]Are you- Yeah, he's trying to think if the fish down there is seeing me right now.
[226:46.40]The fish.
[226:48.26]Yeah?
[226:56.58]Okay.
[226:57.68]Let's go.
[226:58.08]I wonder- What's the wizard vulnerable to?
[227:13.07]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[227:14.79]What?
[227:15.55]There's too many fucking people here.
[227:31.18]Are you serious?
[227:32.86]How was I ever going to do that?
[227:33.78]I don't even know where I'm going right now.
[227:35.62]I'm so lost.
[227:36.50]Where even was that?
[227:39.94]Consecutive wall jump.
[227:44.03]What?
[227:45.21]Why am I doing this?
[227:47.61]Hello?
[227:48.01]Um... Am I supposed to be here?
[228:03.23]Okay.
[228:05.45]Okay.
[228:12.48]I don't know where this is.
[228:13.80]I got another sculptor's idol.
[228:30.63]Any items that I can get?
[228:49.02]The fire looks beautiful.
[228:50.10]I was too busy paying attention to how wonderful looking your game world was FromSoftware and you put an archer right next to me.
[229:02.88]That's a lot of people.
[229:12.77]Oh my god.
[229:13.64]I'm gonna break.
[229:18.44]Nice eagle eye.
[229:21.02]Of course, the guy has a fucking eagle eye, really.
[229:24.66]He has no line of sight on me.
[229:26.08]He can't see me.
[229:26.85]And he's just shooting at the wall.
[229:27.95]That's unbelievable.
[229:38.58]They shoot so much faster too.
[229:41.36]Now I'm fucked.
[229:43.83]Oh, I'm fucked here.
[229:48.05]Absolutely.
[229:49.59]Fighting more than just one enemy in this game.
[229:52.79]Is like... No way.
[229:54.63]Good luck.
[230:00.26]What?
[230:00.48]I got predicted.
[230:02.28]I got predicted.
[230:05.84]Holy shit there.
[230:09.89]Oh my fucking god.
[230:11.69]Come on, why?
[230:29.66]I didn't know it was gonna happen.
[230:32.94]You don't even have like one second of immunity?
[230:36.22]You don't have like a half second of immunity?
[230:45.98]Alright, I think I'm gonna have a different approach to this, because... This seems almost... almost undoable.
[230:55.07]I'm gonna have to... you're gonna have to pick people up one by one.
[231:03.02]You can't... you can't just walk up there.
[231:04.80]No way.
[231:09.22]Give me my other tools.
[231:10.37]I'm gonna have to do a fall here.
[231:17.01]I could do one or two at a time.
[231:18.30]Anything more than that.
[231:18.96]That's an uh-uh.
[231:50.95]Oh fuck it, that didn't matter.
[231:54.96]Jesus, I didn't see you.
[232:02.10]Man, I knew he was gonna shoot at me too.
[232:21.96]Fuck you.
[232:23.42]Fuck you!
[232:26.10]Alright, so far so good.
[232:44.62]Just watch out for Hawkeye.
[232:49.59]Don't I have to grapple?
[232:50.77]Move to... Probably not.
[233:04.78]Music stopped, which means I'm safe.
[233:20.27]Almost not completed.
[233:22.17]Almost.
[233:25.45]Not quite.
[233:31.05]Burn.
[233:31.57]It's burn powder.
[233:32.47]There's a lot of fire here.
[233:34.33]Something tells me I'm probably going to need to use this.
[233:36.25]I gotta get my inventory ready.
[233:43.33]Is that the... No.
[233:47.38]Alright.
[233:48.60]Maybe just go through the house.
[233:52.39]Almost incompletable.
[233:56.81]Divine confetti.
[234:01.20]Made for driving away apparitions.
[234:06.46]The paper is made ceremoniously where my pulp is spread thin using water from the exalted fountainhead.
[234:16.55]So this is to be able to hit ghosts.
[234:20.39]Why is there...
[234:28.17]You swing through this wall, the game's getting a full letter grade downgrade.
[234:55.72]I need more.
[234:56.86]I see something.
[234:57.82]Oh, that's just more of that.
[235:00.86]Okay.
[235:05.05]No more enemies.
[235:08.43]There's a bunch of shit.
[235:09.37]Illusory wall.
[235:15.84]I didn't clear everything over here, though.
[235:17.26]I'm gonna get spotted by something.
[235:19.56]Maybe not.
[235:26.39]It's down here, nothing.
[235:36.88]Oh.
[235:41.65]Is there more?
[235:48.91]I guess I can go this way.
[235:55.41]There's even more of these idiots over here.
[235:59.87]Well, I'm going to have to start pulling people.
[236:17.45]Is Sekiro the bad guy or the good guy?
[236:20.53]He's an anti-hero.
[236:23.59]He could be anything.
[236:25.98]No, no, no.
[236:26.42]Calm down.
[236:38.94]I bumped into a fucking piece of plastic.
[236:46.21]Let's get a pirate here.
[236:55.20]I figured these guys out.
[236:57.02]You just gotta get that lunge.
[236:57.93]You can insta-kill him.
[237:03.69]I'm not opening one of those coin stacks.
[237:08.26]Try me.
[237:11.84]Until I need them.
[237:30.70]Um... Who's drunk?
[237:36.99]Who's drunk?
[237:37.45]Who- Jo- Joseph the Drunkard!
[237:44.06]I think I may have... bugged out an economy here.
[237:52.92]Um... Uh... I-
[237:57.84]Well, he certainly is drunk, yeah.
[238:02.01]He certainly had a fuse to drink.
[238:05.09]Do I have to fight everybody in here?
[238:06.49]Is he gonna- do we all fight?
[238:17.05]I'm confused right now.
[238:21.97]What is he doing?
[238:23.07]Is he stuck?
[238:29.02]So this is not a scenario where Jozu the Drunkard comes out and kills everybody.
[238:34.44]And invites you.
[238:36.62]Did I miss a cutscene?
[238:39.41]I may have missed a cutscene.
[238:51.13]I'm in the hallway.
[238:53.93]This is bad.
[238:54.99]This is very bad.
[238:56.01]Are you sure I don't get a, like, gun in this game?
[239:04.09]Because that's how I would see completing this.
[239:12.96]Well, gotta deal with it, right?
[239:36.25]As long as he stays stuck on stairs and shit, I can care less.
[239:38.80]Who's next?
[239:41.16]Just me and you?
[239:45.42]Um...
[240:07.62]Alright, let's see what you got.
[240:08.36]What moves do you got?
[240:09.86]You got an Acid Spit.
[240:12.06]He spits it two times.
[240:15.66]That lingers for a while, too.
[240:17.42]So this guy can be anti-poison.
[240:21.17]That doesn't really hurt him.
[240:27.05]Wow, that's a push.
[240:27.79]Okay.
[240:28.57]He drinks.
[240:30.97]I'm almost dead.
[240:31.59]Ah, I'm not dead.
[240:37.66]That was... I could have gone a little better.
[240:51.87]Oh my god.
[240:55.09]Holy shit.
[241:01.39]I don't even know how I even happened.
[241:04.27]He, like, got stuck in the wall and then I had to fight, like, six people.
[241:24.97]I thought, like, if I ran into the middle it was gonna do, like, a cutscene or something.
[241:28.59]Apparently not.
[241:33.89]Let me just see how that is supposed to work.
[241:36.21]Yeah, under a potential normal circumstance.
[241:38.45]Hold on.
[241:56.62]So I'm realizing right now... This... whole... this area sucks.
[242:07.11]Can I just run by these guys, or do I have to deal with this every time?
[242:11.26]Like, there's gotta be a way I can jump over that.
[242:19.20]I can just run.
[242:20.04]How am I supposed to deal with this part?
[242:24.48]Can this just kind of stealth take out everybody?
[242:35.31]What?
[242:35.99]Oh, hi!
[242:39.46]Hi there!
[242:42.49]You want... Really?
[242:47.63]Come on!
[242:48.27]I'm talking to an NPC!
[243:04.34]I'm gonna kill the NPC accidentally.
[243:05.88]This is...
[243:11.79]Oh my god.
[243:17.44]Can I- I just want to hear what the fuck this guy has to say.
[243:21.14]Somebody explain that.
[243:29.05]I want one of you guys to go to med school.
[243:31.29]Become a doctor.
[243:32.33]And explain how I was not locked onto that guy.
[243:35.07]What happened?
[243:36.27]Go be a scientist.
[243:37.43]Go do like 50 years of game development.
[243:39.88]And then figure out what just happened right there.
[243:51.56]Are you gonna fund it?
[244:02.55]My controller has low battery.
[244:04.81]My controller doesn't have low battery!
[244:08.30]It's plugged into the wall!
[244:10.42]Or whatever, into the computer!
[244:13.15]I don't have low battery.
[244:15.39]Who is fighting me?
[244:18.06]Oh my god!
[244:57.68]Fuck this area.
[244:59.65]I'm gonna come back and fucking slit this guy's throat when I'm like 15 levels higher.
[245:04.26]Fuck this place.
[245:05.14]This place sucks.
[245:09.52]There was another way I could go.
[245:17.13]They just throw up like fucking 20 enemies in a fire zone.
[245:21.61]And then a big fat guy comes out and drinks.
[245:24.45]No, I want to hear what that guy has to say.
[245:26.03]I want to hear the NPC.
[245:44.54]Can I get over through this way?
[245:45.86]I have to be able to, right?
[245:52.60]I swear to God, if this is one of those scenarios where I have to go get another weapon arc thing, and I just fucking throw a grenade at him or something and he instantly dies, I'm gonna be upset.
[246:03.01]I don't think I can jump over that.
[246:22.33]Okay.
[246:23.81]Where is he?
[246:24.27]Let's listen to this guy.
[246:25.63]Let's get away from these people.
[246:28.68]Hide.
[246:29.14]Wait.
[246:29.72]Just deflect.
[246:30.60]Where are they?
[246:31.12]Are they going to come over here?
[246:32.06]Yeah, there they are.
[246:32.70]He's going to shoot me through the bush.
[246:35.64]It's just one guy.
[246:37.31]And he still has his sights on.
[246:38.51]That's fine.
[246:56.98]Just talk to me.
[246:58.64]So I can figure out what I need to do here.
[247:01.10]There's definitely something to do.
[247:02.48]I have to pull a lever and a big log is going to come crashing down from a tree.
[247:10.41]That's probably what I... I can't move when you're in a conversation with an NPC.
[247:16.29]They've made five of these games.
[247:18.07]You can move when talking to people?
[247:19.40]What?
[247:19.52]What?
[247:44.92]I found the secret.
[247:48.52]I found the way.
[247:49.84]I found the way!
[247:50.95]I found the way to do it!
[247:53.23]Alright, we fight together.
[247:56.23]Me and this guy.
[248:07.75]I knew there was something weird going on, but why didn't he... I hope he doesn't get his ass kicked.
[248:12.52]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[248:13.22]Can he just beat him for me?
[248:15.68]No, no, no, no, no.
[248:16.60]He's gonna die.
[248:18.12]I... I wasn't prepared for this.
[248:23.27]He's gonna get hit like three times and die.
[248:29.95]What is the lock on doing?
[248:31.89]Why?
[248:32.73]Is the lock on?
[248:34.39]This is... I... I don't like this lock on very much.
[248:37.19]I'm gonna be completely honest here.
[248:38.61]It like keeps taking itself off of people.
[248:46.51]What?
[248:46.85]He's dead.
[248:48.25]What the fuck?
[248:54.64]Are you kidding me?
[248:55.28]This is on by default?
[248:57.68]No, it's not.
[248:58.42]Oh, fuck off game.
[249:09.58]I'm so dead.
[249:14.74]Kill all the minions then recruit the guy?
[249:16.28]I didn't even know that's what it did!
[249:17.78]Auto-target.
[249:28.65]What?
[249:29.33]What are you thinking?
[249:41.33]God, that voice is gonna kill me.
[250:00.34]He doesn't have one.
[250:07.27]What, a bit of fire?
[250:08.07]I don't have any healing left or anything, either.
[250:14.64]Bad.
[250:15.00]Alright, so I know... I have a basic understanding of how to do this fight.
[250:22.80]I'm gonna clear the people that are over here, and then recruit them, and then fight.
[250:30.71]I'd be lucky to even get one hit on them.
[250:36.59]Let me see if I can... Kill this dude!
[250:49.38]I'm trying!
[250:57.14]Oh, that's a grab, but I somehow got... Hang on...
[251:06.82]Poison spit.
[251:07.66]I wonder if fire will work here.
[251:10.62]Maybe if I get a good dodge.
[251:20.22]Do another grab.
[251:24.92]No, you gotta just dodge those.
[251:26.37]Here we go.
[251:30.49]Oh, I'm dead.
[251:43.25]Oh, I can pause the game.
[251:44.19]Alright, let me see.
[251:48.89]Get all this shit out of here.
[251:50.87]I don't even, I can't even, yeah, have a healing pellet.
[251:54.29]Alright, oil.
[251:58.06]Oil and then burn him, maybe?
[251:59.38]I wonder.
[252:03.28]I'm going to try to cover him in oil and burn him when he doesn't drink.
[252:22.11]That was Covenant Oil.
[252:25.73]Did that do anything?
[252:27.25]Ooh, it kinda does!
[252:29.45]Oh man.
[252:33.19]Oh my goodness.
[252:40.20]Ayayay.
[252:45.48]Try to ignite his Alcohol Breath, maybe.
[252:56.41]Um... I have this, like, sinking feeling that I'm not supposed to be in this area.
[253:03.30]I don't know how true that is.
[253:04.14]I have a feeling I skipped too much, and I'm way over my head.
[253:09.94]Pretty sure.
[253:10.30]Because there was, like, two areas that I... I feel like I shouldn't be here right now.
[253:23.94]I'm gonna give this one last try before going back.
[253:33.99]Something about this just feels harder than it should feel.
[253:39.49]At least in regards to, like, how many enemies are here.
[253:43.70]How many healing gourds I have.
[253:54.93]There's just so many people here.
[253:56.17]It almost feels like these people shouldn't even be here.
[253:58.21]This place is burning.
[253:59.09]What are you doing here?
[254:09.95]This ramped up to a thousand.
[254:11.53]Let's see if I can just clear this.
[254:22.63]I'll never get it.
[254:26.04]Every time.
[254:42.39]I'm gonna burn.
[254:43.47]Ah, fuck this area.
[254:46.63]Ah, no.
[254:47.35]No.
[254:47.87]No.
[254:48.03]I ain't fighting five, six people at the same time.
[254:50.87]Not right now.
[254:51.89]I'm going to the other fucking zone.
[254:55.51]No thanks.
[255:00.54]Uh, where was it?
[255:01.12]Over here, right?
[255:12.94]I can come back when I have, like, another attack power.
[255:17.18]I was just gonna bang my head against the ceiling.
[255:19.04]Because I'm so damn tall.
[255:20.92]Alright, there was a couple of places.
[255:26.95]It was over here, right?
[255:28.19]Because I remember being like, oh, I got this!
[255:30.47]And I went back, and I... That whole area... Was me dropping the... Bell.
[255:38.57]So this is where I was going.
[255:40.14]Progressing kind of normally through the game.
[255:50.83]I don't feel safe with that big bastard just tied up next to us.
[255:54.64]I'd rather not be gravely injured just before the war begins.
[255:58.42]Ah, if the worst happens, the only choice is to use fire.
[256:03.66]Those red eyes fear me.
[256:06.41]Proclamation, Seth.
[256:08.55]Proclamation.
[256:10.29]What a joke.
[256:11.23]Ugh, okay.
[256:11.91]I'm alright.
[256:12.31]I'm sure it has a funny way of preparing for war.
[256:16.73]Oh, funny.
[256:17.31]Yeah, funny.
[256:17.83]You've seen it and heard about it.
[256:25.88]I got only one pellet though.
[256:32.29]That guy can just see me.
[257:00.18]not broken their guard yet?
[257:01.38]How is that possible?
[257:03.00]I hear a loud sound.
[257:08.80]I'm gonna take his health down.
[257:35.31]Who's making this noise?
[257:41.35]It's another boss?
[257:43.31]Really?
[257:44.49]Oh shit.
[257:46.17]Chained Ogre.
[257:49.14]He's tied up to hurt.
[257:51.26]Grab attacks cannot be deflected.
[257:55.94]There's no way to avoid taking serious damage once grabbed.
[257:59.93]Enemy grab attacks can be evaded with a well-timed step dodge.
[258:02.99]Even the strongest attacks are useless if they don't make contact.
[258:14.02]That was the exact same animation.
[258:16.47]And energy.
[258:17.03]Okay, I'm gonna stop talking because I can't do it and speak at the same time.
[258:25.35]I was gonna say the blacksmith from Dark Souls 1.
[258:26.71]Alright, now I'll be quiet.
[258:28.43]Oh my god, he fucked it up.
[258:30.01]I'm dead instantly.
[258:31.27]Oh my fucking god.
[258:35.80]This is insane.
[258:38.92]Insane!
[258:42.80]What?
[258:43.42]That's not a dodge!
[258:46.86]That's not a to- Oh my, you gotta be kidding me.
[258:54.53]That's not a dodge?
[259:05.21]I don't think I even want to attempt to dodge that.
[259:07.29]I'm just gonna fucking... I don't even know.
[259:14.76]I don't even know.
[259:17.82]Just never kill that guy.
[259:22.87]Let me try this again.
[259:30.71]He's not already up, is he?
[259:31.65]Oh, there he is.
[259:35.78]um okay let's try this again I don't even honestly whoa whoa I just saw an indicator on his head there that was much faster
[260:16.87]You seriously have got to be kidding me.
[260:19.88]What?
[260:20.76]Why are you over here?
[260:22.02]I'm like fighting somebody.
[260:23.72]I'm currently in the middle of something.
[260:26.36]Why are you here?
[260:37.51]I feel like I need to start just dying.
[260:39.29]I'm gonna kill everybody.
[260:40.39]Should I just keep... I feel like I shouldn't be fucking resurrecting just to die again.
[260:49.48]Oh, wealth.
[260:52.70]Wrong button.
[261:15.12]I'm dead!
[261:31.97]He has like two different lunges.
[261:34.25]He has a really quick one, that's the power bomb.
[261:39.11]And then he has a longer one, which is the instant kill.
[261:45.39]Okay, so let's try this again.
[261:47.89]Clear the trash that's here.
[261:52.05]There's one more guy.
[262:02.41]He's like up here.
[262:06.27]Can I get up there if I'm over here?
[262:12.98]Of course you can't fucking do it, unless you start the encounter.
[262:18.87]Alright, don't get too overzealous here.
[262:23.67]Grab again?
[262:26.17]Do it.
[262:50.61]No way!
[262:51.59]I don't believe it!
[262:55.93]Get this bolt motherfucker out of here!
[263:31.40]Double the burn again.
[263:37.53]You gotta wait for the grab.
[263:59.23]You gotta watch out.
[264:00.51]He just did an elbow drop.
[264:03.11]That's a stupid fucking move.
[264:12.48]Woo!
[264:30.31]I was just gonna drop him off the fucking ledge.
[264:32.52]Why does he have elbow drops?
[264:42.66]WWE Ogre.
[264:43.70]He's like The Rock.
[264:45.44]Did they chain him up and like fucking clockwork Orange's eyes in front of like the Attitude Era?
[264:51.23]Alright, got prayer beads.
[264:57.36]A loose prayer bead offering four of them will increase.
[264:59.60]Okay, two beads.
[265:08.33]Okay, new medicine rank.
[265:12.09]The only way to learn such techniques is to be gravely injured time and time again by worthy opponents.
[265:19.35]Nice.
[265:21.47]I did it.
[265:23.64]That was fun.
[265:26.12]I didn't even have to complain that much about that fight.
[265:29.07]It was this guy up here that was the problem.
[265:30.67]It was this guy.
[265:32.85]The random guy standing up here.
[265:41.63]That was cool.
[265:42.57]Alright.
[265:43.19]Is that a boss or is that a... How do I even know if he's a real boss?
[265:57.23]Guess we can go up there and nothing else, right?
[266:01.95]Why does that just end up being a standard enemy?
[266:03.63]That would be so disheartening.
[266:07.42]That's five community gifted subs from JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[266:11.40]What a liar.
[266:14.52]Thank you.
[266:16.56]Nightjar Monocular.
[266:19.27]Bamboo tube used to see distant objects.
[266:21.93]Well, Shinobi already have good vision.
[266:23.41]Looking through this tube with one eye enables one to see even further.
[266:27.86]Okay.
[266:29.40]So this is the binoculars that no one ever uses.
[266:33.68]I swear one day in one of these FromSoftware games... You know, they... Oh, wow, I can't believe they're finding secrets in Dark Souls 1.
[266:42.81]Ten years later.
[266:44.05]Wow, yeah, that's interesting.
[266:45.57]This is gonna be something.
[266:47.47]Nobody puts the binoculars on.
[266:48.77]Nobody uses them.
[266:50.71]FromSoftware has probably something hidden in a skybox.
[266:53.91]You can only see if you have the binoculars equipped.
[266:56.51]The game knows you have them on.
[267:01.44]Yeah, finally another gourd seed.
[267:03.14]I knew there was something going on in that last area.
[267:05.24]Like, it was a secret, special little other area.
[267:08.24]I had two flasks.
[267:11.32]That place just felt way over my head.
[267:14.28]And it was.
[267:20.50]Anything else?
[267:22.13]Ooh.
[267:24.87]Can't open that.
[267:32.98]Oh, I see.
[267:33.74]This is like... I'm not doing this yet.
[267:49.51]I'm going to spend points and stuff.
[267:59.86]I hit $87.
[268:00.70]I had like 1,000 20 minutes ago.
[268:06.59]Do I have... Let me see.
[268:09.23]Three skill points.
[268:13.91]Maximum spirit emblems or... I have three points.
[268:17.99]I wonder if I should hold off with this.
[268:27.96]I wonder if I should wait one more point and get the better heal.
[268:34.20]Or... If I should do something else.
[268:51.79]Mmm.
[268:55.57]Mmm.
[268:58.41]I'm gonna have most of them eventually anyways, but I think I'm gonna hold off for this one.
[269:02.67]I just don't know.
[269:17.76]I just don't know.
[269:27.48]Maybe this.
[269:28.62]Uh... Uh... This... Yeah.
[269:44.39]I don't have any of these yet.
[269:46.67]Counter thrust attacks by stomping down.
[269:48.64]Let me see.
[270:00.82]Do I need to put it on, or is it just available now?
[270:07.24]I think it's just... I just know it, right?
[270:08.92]Passively, right?
[270:17.44]There's something about this game that makes it distinctly more frustrating than other FromSoft games.
[270:24.54]I think it's just not being used to how the game is not supposed to play like Dark Souls.
[270:32.91]It's the same engine, it's the same inventory slots, the same UI, technically, right?
[270:40.50]But you really are not supposed to play this like Dark Souls, and that is frustrating.
[270:44.58]Not because it's frustrating like, oh, I can't believe I want to play Dark Souls 4!
[270:49.06]But because you're just so used to playing all these games in such a fashion that now you don't.
[270:54.70]Not anymore.
[270:57.51]And your brain and your body kind of run into each other.
[271:06.23]But it's great.
[271:10.12]I think it's great so far.
[271:14.32]Forget about these guys.
[271:15.12]Get me out of here.
[271:29.00]Alright, so... Oops.
[271:34.02]That's the antagonist of the game.
[271:41.41]Oh, cutscene?
[271:42.33]No, wait.
[271:42.93]I have to fight this guy?
[271:44.35]This is the guy I fought in the first section.
[271:47.69]Is he just gonna... Alright.
[271:53.56]No, it's just... It's just fight guy.
[271:56.50]No, this...
[271:59.40]Wait a minute.
[272:00.02]People are shooting bows and arrows and shit?
[272:02.40]I'm not ready for this!
[272:07.51]Oh, man.
[272:08.59]That's got a lot of defense.
[272:15.95]Where's the other guy shooting the bow?
[272:34.90]Where is he?
[272:35.50]Where is he?
[272:38.26]I didn't block that.
[272:39.58]What?
[272:40.14]How did you not block that?
[272:43.04]I'm surprised by that.
[272:47.28]I thought I was deflecting.
[272:52.47]Well, now I know.
[273:02.35]Forget everything I know.
[273:02.93]There's no cutscenes that trigger.
[273:04.41]Why would I... Alright, you've got a guy standing in a big open zone.
[273:09.63]It's like, okay, like, this is something's gonna happen here.
[273:11.85]Nope.
[273:13.11]Aggro the whole time.
[273:15.93]I gotta stop doing that.
[273:20.44]Because it's not a boss.
[273:23.76]I thought it was the guy from the beginning of the game.
[273:42.40]When you get in a situation like this, you just die.
[273:46.42]It's almost impossible to come back from this with like five people chasing you.
[273:53.25]Might as well just die twice.
[273:55.15]Just do the title of the game.
[274:03.13]Just bone out, yeah.
[274:04.37]There's no reason we should continue this.
[274:12.16]Especially considering that the game pauses.
[274:15.76]Why wouldn't I just leave?
[274:16.68]Oh my god.
[274:26.59]We get to learn the hard way that that takes almost twice as long as it does in Dark Souls.
[274:31.81]Okay, good.
[274:32.57]Cool.
[274:47.05]So we're going to wrap around.
[274:51.10]We're going to wrap around and stealth kill a few people and then fight the guy in the middle.
[275:07.87]Just like this.
[275:25.50]Where do they are?
[275:31.34]What else do I got?
[275:44.26]Come here.
[275:44.56]If you do that, you're going to shatter every bone in your wrist.
[275:59.05]You're gonna have to give me another arm.
[276:01.54]Um... Yeah, can I...?
[276:09.76]I just want to sneak around, but that guy's just looking.
[276:12.04]This is, uh... Nice stealth.
[276:19.57]Well, I'm just...
[276:23.17]And now here we go again.
[276:24.79]Hey, play the fucking Benny Hill music!
[276:26.59]Here's 15 fucking people chasing you!
[276:41.30]Reset.
[276:56.66]Again.
[277:12.02]So, what's over here?
[277:12.94]Can I do something over this way?
[277:15.88]I feel like this guy is always taking a look to the left.
[277:19.44]So, I can't even go that way.
[277:22.51]So, let's try this way.
[277:28.11]Nope.
[278:05.13]Are they all connected to the same computer?
[278:19.15]Yes, they are, actually.
[278:20.66]Yeah, I mean, like, but...
[278:24.81]They communicate with this thing called sound.
[278:28.11]And then you have to go to the left.
[278:41.64]So the question is, how do I get this guy to turn the fuck around?
[278:45.18]Because it's obvious.
[278:46.75]It's obvious, right?
[278:47.85]That I have to go this way.
[278:49.77]I can't go over there.
[278:50.51]Everybody sees you and then the entire game aggro's to you.
[278:53.21]So let's just try this way.
[278:56.76]No.
[278:58.02]Guy walking this way right now.
[279:01.03]He's ready to come over here.
[279:05.25]How do I pull this guy without pulling the whole entire game?
[279:09.74]It's got to be over here.
[279:10.68]Like this.
[279:25.66]He doesn't walk all the way up here, does he?
[279:28.54]What path is this?
[279:31.20]He just comes to the very top of the stairs.
[279:36.54]Don't tell me you just stand there.
[279:37.52]You turn around eventually, right?
[279:38.84]Thank you.
[279:50.28]Okay.
[279:51.70]That leaves this guy...
[279:54.83]who I wonder... Okay, let me just throw this out here.
[279:57.40]Does he not hear that?
[280:04.49]Yes, sir.
[280:25.20]Um, I mean, there's... I guess I just have to go get him.
[280:36.08]Everybody's tough.
[280:37.52]Anyway, here we go.
[280:44.87]Even the guy from down here likes to... What the fuck?
[280:51.71]This guy with the frying pan!
[281:01.63]Maybe I should kill frying pan guy first.
[281:09.62]Is it enough weeds to hide me?
[281:10.70]Probably not.
[281:19.35]Still got line of sight.
[281:24.33]Oh god.
[281:25.03]What do I do?
[281:28.82]Okay.
[281:30.20]I'll take it.
[281:30.56]I don't know where I am, but I'll take it.
[281:31.54]There's that confetti again.
[281:38.72]What's this?
[281:39.84]Turn back if you value your life.
[281:41.38]You can't behead the headless.
[281:42.54]Our swords and pikes did nothing.
[281:51.35]So this is a new zone.
[281:56.21]I'm not done with this one yet, though.
[282:00.61]Not yet.
[282:09.36]I can go around.
[282:12.26]This is an opportunity to catch this guy.
[282:15.61]Without anybody else, maybe?
[282:19.79]I think I can pull this guy.
[282:21.91]And just be me and him.
[282:27.27]I don't see anybody else.
[282:29.63]Let's go.
[282:31.01]Here we go.
[282:38.22]Ugh, not far enough.
[282:47.00]Alright, the question I have is... He didn't see me first.
[282:52.65]He's literally looking at me.
[283:11.00]Oh, my God.
[283:15.80]Oh, my God.
[283:53.32]Oh, that's a jump, that's a jump.
[283:54.36]Okay, he does that slash.
[283:59.81]Fuck, he broke my guard!
[284:09.70]Easy.
[284:14.56]Fuck.
[284:15.92]No!
[284:45.72]Wow!
[284:48.88]Oh, what?
[284:50.84]Oh, why?
[284:51.84]That was like a quarter of a second move.
[284:57.07]Not close enough.
[285:22.73]What was that?
[285:33.34]I thought I was dead.
[285:34.26]Holy shit.
[285:46.01]Now I gotta do all that dog shit again.
[285:56.95]The whole courtyard with the guy with the frying pan.
[286:09.70]I gotta kill that guy first.
[286:16.96]He's right there, but he's gonna start playing the music.
[286:18.76]The second I step out here, it's gonna be like, ready, watch this.
[286:21.81]I'm gonna go for Frying Pan Man first.
[286:24.47]And then it's gonna go... Everyone's gonna be fighting me.
[286:29.77]Ready?
[286:30.09]Here we go.
[286:32.69]It already happened.
[286:54.32]It's ceramic only goes so far.
[286:56.32]It only goes a short distance in front of you.
[287:11.60]Where is this?
[287:12.18]Oh, of course.
[287:24.33]How did you even get there?
[287:27.87]Should I even ask?
[287:50.35]This is bullshit.
[287:53.85]There he is.
[287:54.43]Let's go.
[287:58.10]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[288:00.64]I want to fight him alone.
[288:01.62]Not like with three people.
[288:19.14]That move.
[288:21.24]That move!
[288:22.38]It is... Here's this like dickhead friend that came running around.
[288:50.39]I have to get away from this.
[288:52.11]It's not possible to fight two or three people at the same time.
[288:54.59]You gotta like run and hide or something.
[288:57.38]I'm gonna go upgrade.
[289:02.78]I have a seed.
[289:15.79]No, that's not the right way.
[289:23.22]It's this way.
[289:24.00]Let's get three heals.
[289:56.12]Undying samurai training.
[289:59.60]Oh.
[290:01.78]Uh, I'm gonna do that.
[290:06.71]Why are you guys talking shit about the VOD?
[290:08.07]What's- why are you making fun of the VOD?
[290:09.63]Let's see how this works.
[290:21.08]I should know if I can perceive incoming thrust attacks and counter them by stepping on the enemy blade.
[290:25.64]This is a powerful, if risky, move that deals more posture damage.
[290:31.62]How?
[290:34.32]Like that?
[290:35.61]Oh, just so you dodge.
[290:39.85]You're going to dodge in a direction.
[290:45.53]That's actually really good.
[290:57.24]If it's a chat thing, I wouldn't understand.
[290:59.01]Well, that's good to know.
[291:05.83]So it's just a standard dog.
[291:07.69]Thank you.
[291:08.61]What about in here?
[291:11.44]Anything?
[291:18.56]Unhip.
[291:20.40]What do you mean, unhip?
[291:21.40]Where's the lady?
[291:29.28]No, they like dying here together.
[291:31.18]What are you doing?
[291:31.92]Hmm?
[291:33.50]Oh I didn't realize you were here.
[291:36.20]The sculptor has been coughing blood I took a sample of this blood for my dragon rod research a sample of his blood.
[291:44.65]Yes Blood that he's coughed up
[291:47.55]The color of the blood itself appears to be tainted.
[291:51.21]Tainted blood?
[291:52.35]But the sculptor's blood alone isn't enough to reach any conclusions.
[291:58.37]Is there anything I can do?
[292:00.11]Yes.
[292:01.23]Bring me samples of blood coughed up by others that suffer from the dragon rot.
[292:06.27]If I have more, I'll be able to learn more about the disease.
[292:10.63]If I come across anyone afflicted by the dragon rot, I'll ask them.
[292:15.29]Thank you.
[292:18.05]Oh, come here.
[292:22.37]Three heals.
[292:27.66]And I don't think I have any more skills I can do, right?
[292:29.56]Not at the moment.
[292:35.66]No, no.
[292:37.66]Well, mid-air deflection.
[292:42.18]Or run and slide.
[292:47.76]Mmm, I'll hold on to it.
[293:05.03]Quick, give me some of your blood so I can use it.
[293:24.37]So what about that door?
[293:25.53]Can I just open the door?
[293:29.39]Hold on.
[293:30.95]This is important.
[293:44.50]Where is that door?
[293:45.40]I don't even know what to do here.
[293:52.13]I really don't.
[293:53.90]I'm just gonna wait for this guy.
[294:03.53]Maybe I can stealth kill that guy eventually.
[294:05.47]I don't know.
[294:30.92]I do appreciate the stealth kill, but... I don't like how loud it is.
[294:38.52]I feel like everyone's hearing that.
[294:40.80]The big, like, chime sound.
[295:02.00]Okay, those two guys with shields or they just props I Can't I don't know What do you do when you have a shield that big you just kind of sit on the ground and rest on it, right Well these guys be able to see me
[295:35.90]Okay.
[295:38.74]This guy's freaking me out.
[295:39.86]Alright, so there's that guy over there.
[295:41.66]Can I get on top of the roof?
[295:45.61]This is not... That is a roof right there, but what's the next step?
[295:50.39]Did everybody hear that?
[296:06.82]There's a guy with a pan!
[296:07.52]He's gonna start SMACKING the pan and everyone's gonna be like, right here we go.
[296:22.13]There's a big guy.
[296:24.11]There he is.
[296:24.93]There's a guy with a musket over here.
[296:44.98]I had to let him do it for a little while longer because that's the only thing he does.
[296:48.50]He doesn't know how to do anything else.
[296:52.00]I just wanted to make sure that he at least got some enjoyment of the last few seconds of his life.
[296:58.84]I believe that's everybody.
[297:03.77]Where's big guy?
[297:08.35]There he is.
[297:11.69]Now, can I get the drop on him?
[297:14.69]With a... stealth jump thing?
[297:18.17]Because he comes back to here, right?
[297:22.57]He's going to come, walk, and he's going to turn around.
[297:24.34]I don't know if I can.
[297:28.14]At least not from here.
[297:34.42]I could try to just backstab him, but... I feel like he's... He'll probably hear me.
[297:40.87]I'll give it a go.
[297:41.83]I'll give it a go on this next turn here.
[297:52.76]Do that every time.
[298:23.56]Oh, that sucked.
[298:25.46]He's gonna get all of his posture back now.
[298:27.20]I didn't catch that?
[298:57.99]No, don't do that shit!
[299:04.08]Oh my goodness gracious, that's a new move.
[299:05.98]I'm gonna die again.
[299:11.87]I had it going too.
[299:32.30]I'm gonna kill him, I think, but he's gonna be real fucking messy.
[299:47.75]Well, I have three.
[299:51.94]All it took was me, uh, making everybody sick again.
[299:54.46]At least that guy's dead.
[300:07.54]You know what this game reminds me of?
[300:10.66]Metal Gear Rising.
[300:13.32]It's like a more punishing version of Metal Gear Rising, in a way.
[300:19.85]That parry... feels like Metal Gear Rising.
[300:26.09]It's like a slowed down version of trying to block with that sword.
[300:40.15]Alright, so, how do I cross this bridge?
[300:50.12]Doesn't look like I can grab it from here.
[300:53.56]Well, I think I found it.
[300:59.66]Hello?
[301:02.98]What?
[301:06.42]No!
[301:07.66]I'm gonna sneak attack you!
[301:11.40]If I died by that lizard, it would have been very embarrassing.
[301:27.32]I need one more bead.
[301:35.32]I'm assuming memory is when you do those other areas.
[301:44.97]Oh, that one hurt.
[301:45.69]That one hurt.
[301:47.83]Okay.
[301:47.93]Alright, here you go.
[301:54.96]You ready for my impressions of the game?
[301:56.50]First impressions?
[301:58.08]It's hard as shit.
[302:01.18]I feel like the learning curve is way steeper than their previous games.
[302:07.38]But, I feel like
[302:11.41]Killing even basic enemies feels like you did something in the game.
[302:17.47]I would say.
[302:24.23]It's definitely really, really, really good.
[302:29.20]There is a sense of accomplishment for killing a guy with a sword in his hand.
[302:34.02]What is going on?
[302:39.26]Because, yeah, they can kill you just as easily.
[302:45.99]What was that earthquake?
[302:55.27]Is there going to be an avalanche?
[302:56.83]Don't tell me there's an avalanche.
[303:13.50]Mid... Yeah, I know how to do that.
[303:21.57]Well, not yet.
[303:22.11]Not yet.
[303:22.41]Wait, wait, wait.
[303:22.91]There's probably something over here.
[303:24.17]Probably something cool.
[303:29.23]Okay, just don't die.
[303:30.45]Don't die.
[303:31.35]Don't die.
[303:31.76]Don't die.
[303:32.14]Don't die.
[303:36.66]Good.
[303:48.19]What?
[303:48.37]What?
[303:50.46]It's a turtle.
[303:51.78]What is that?
[303:52.46]It's a snake.
[303:54.04]Is it a turtle?
[303:55.48]Those turtles with the huge heads?
[303:56.86]Remember those things?
[303:57.68]Oh god, I know.
[303:58.66]Oh, that's big.
[304:00.92]That's a big snake.
[304:05.71]Oh my god.
[304:13.87]Do I have to fight this snake?
[304:23.24]Uh, can I... It's like... It's like Mario!
[304:26.14]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[304:27.20]Not like Mario!
[304:28.64]I mean, the thing in Mario 64 where you have to walk on it... It's like it's a moving... Yes!
[304:47.71]It's not gonna hurt me.
[304:48.59]I have to actually walk on this.
[304:50.87]Just like in Mario.
[304:57.77]Here we go!
[305:00.77]Oh shit.
[305:01.59]Okay, I'm alive.
[305:04.43]Did I miss something?
[305:05.09]I think I may have missed something.
[305:10.57]Maybe he's just here for fun.
[305:19.40]I get to come back!
[305:21.24]The Shadow's died three times in my case.
[305:32.85]But there's an item right there.
[305:36.57]God damn it.
[305:37.11]Hold on.
[305:38.37]Can I get back over here?
[305:51.17]Is he just in the cave?
[305:59.41]I don't even know where I ended up.
[306:01.07]Where is he?
[306:02.47]I don't know where he is.
[306:15.39]Can he make it down here?
[306:16.42]I don't think he can.
[306:19.68]This sucks.
[306:22.74]Wait, what?
[306:41.73]Okay, so... Snake looks for you.
[306:45.60]Don't go near Snake.
[306:47.20]Avoid Snake.
[306:50.94]Guide to Pin Snake.
[306:54.34]You guys are gonna be on that all night, huh?
[306:57.42]You guys are gonna be on the Pin Snake thing.
[307:02.56]Well, now I can at least... There's no items or anything, so...
[307:15.44]I thought I could maybe just make the jump and not have to go here.
[307:18.21]Alright, that leaves this.
[307:27.97]Watch out, the snake!
[307:31.22]Just get across, he can't go over that way.
[307:33.18]Okay, yep.
[307:39.68]Alright, now from in here...
[307:45.72]I have to hide from the snake.
[307:48.10]Oh, he's right here already though.
[307:49.90]Where am I supposed- It's all misty and shit.
[308:07.15]Ugh.
[308:10.75]Oh.
[308:13.91]Um.
[308:16.51]Is he just gonna do that again?
[308:17.35]Fucking god damn it, man.
[308:25.19]God damn it!
[308:27.09]No!
[308:27.99]Get... Why can I even go this way?
[308:29.93]Oh, oh, oh, oh!
[308:44.36]I don't... I don't...
[308:47.65]What did I just do to him?
[308:50.57]What's down here?
[308:57.33]Oh, fuck!
[308:58.01]I don't know what to do!
[308:59.07]I... I am just panicking.
[309:10.31]I don't understand.
[309:21.66]I mean, I guess you'd hug that wall, but then... make it out here?
[309:26.32]It's just so dark and misty, I can't see anything.
[309:32.42]Watch out, ready?
[309:32.98]Whoa!
[309:41.19]Okay, I can hide there.
[309:43.67]So then if I go like this and hide in the bush...
[309:50.18]No, dude.
[309:51.04]No, dude, dude, dude.
[309:51.66]Wait, wait, wait.
[309:52.16]You should be going this way.
[309:56.37]You're not gonna come to the left, are you?
[310:14.99]I can't... I don't... I can't see what the fuck I'm supposed to be doing here.
[310:19.07]Like, I need to go over here, but there's... Can I... Oh, you just have to wait!
[310:27.78]Just wait, okay.
[310:30.00]Easy enough.
[310:39.07]Can he smell me or something?
[310:41.41]Oh man, he's gonna touch me!
[310:45.74]He doesn't even know he's gonna kill me.
[310:47.18]He's gonna accidentally kill me.
[310:49.34]Where's his head?
[310:55.36]Should I swing at him?
[310:59.52]He's gonna constrict me.
[311:10.12]That's a lot of teeth.
[311:13.16]Hug this wall.
[311:15.12]He's gonna go down.
[311:22.06]I gotta wait till he goes down there again.
[311:24.66]Right?
[311:27.06]He's gonna slither over there.
[311:28.08]Maybe I can go this way.
[311:42.25]Bad move, bad move, bad move.
[311:43.27]Very bad move.
[311:55.78]Did he still see me?
[312:19.26]That was in an instant!
[312:20.99]Not even an aggro second.
[312:36.01]Alright, there's one opportunity when he turns to the left.
[312:40.35]And then I'm gonna be hit by the icicles, right?
[312:49.87]I don't even know if this is gonna work.
[312:52.41]Is it like Mario RPG?
[312:53.42]Can I hide behind?
[312:56.20]He's gonna see me.
[312:57.34]He's gonna see me.
[312:58.02]He sees me.
[312:58.40]He sees me.
[313:00.90]There's an item up there.
[313:03.98]I don't know.
[313:04.40]There's no... Can I hide in the dumpster?
[313:31.16]Look at him looking at me through the broken... Holy shit, he knows I'm in here.
[313:38.39]This is horrible.
[313:39.85]Huh?
[313:41.15]What do I do?
[313:42.40]Should I, um...
[314:13.04]I can't get out of this.
[314:20.22]I think I might be trapped.
[314:21.22]I might be softlocked.
[314:34.27]Oh god damn.
[314:38.99]Guys, I can't even press Start, I can't press Select, I can't press Y, nothing.
[314:45.39]I have to Alt F4 to handle it.
[315:00.90]Pause the view.
[315:02.76]So, press Y, I wonder if that'll work.
[315:09.66]Alright, I have to... That was really loud.
[315:17.86]Maybe if I breathe... Wait, hold on!
[315:28.35]Why can I do left and right but nothing else?
[315:34.59]Where's this gonna put me?
[316:07.74]I was under the impression that I was going to hurt him or something, and then I would have to hide again.
[316:11.14]I can't even.
[316:13.42]How am I going to justify anything anymore?
[316:18.43]Let's see what happens.
[316:24.03]I'm the only person that ever walked back in the dumpster.
[316:32.44]But I felt safe in there.
[316:39.70]Even the developers didn't go back in the dumpster.
[316:53.43]What?
[316:59.89]Please don't tell me that... that... Right?
[317:15.17]That's not fair.
[317:16.33]Okay.
[317:17.73]That's... Um... We have a major problem here.
[317:26.36]I couldn't just resurrect.
[317:27.70]R2 didn't work.
[317:33.19]Uh-huh.
[317:37.15]R2 doesn't work anymore.
[317:45.42]I need to just start.
[317:48.86]I can't pause the game.
[317:50.98]Can I do it on keyboard?
[317:52.90]No.
[317:58.76]Hold on.
[318:00.62]Alright, that was weird.
[318:11.19]Why?
[318:11.59]Look at my, I didn't die.
[318:16.14]Okay, let's go.
[318:17.58]Unplug the controller.
[318:22.50]Seems like it's fixed now, but just for the sake of doing that, I'm going to do it.
[318:32.06]Just because, you know.
[318:41.71]Okay, I think everything is now fine.
[318:45.67]Let's go back and this time only go in the birdhouse once.
[318:51.75]I thought there was no fall damage in the game.
[318:59.43]Silly me!
[319:22.57]No, don't do anything silly.
[319:36.84]Okay, then it's into the outhouse.
[319:39.36]Wait till he turns left.
[319:53.86]and there you go into the dumpster but the item I gotta okay I'm gonna stab him and then get the item
[320:21.52]I have, like, a couple seconds to quickly get it.
[320:27.94]Snapseed.
[320:30.48]Useful in breaking the illusion of... Effective illusion techniques.
[320:39.51]Okay.
[320:54.90]Now where?
[320:57.62]Wow!
[320:59.03]Safe?
[321:00.19]I think I'm safe here.
[321:01.81]Yep.
[321:03.29]Jesus!
[321:04.09]My god.
[321:04.55]Maybe not.
[321:05.07]Is he gonna worm his way in here?
[321:08.10]I think he's stuffing his body in here.
[321:09.20]Wait, which side is he going?
[321:10.68]Oh my god.
[321:11.42]He's coming over this way, I think.
[321:27.33]What's all over me?
[321:46.37]Snake pee-pee.
[321:48.33]More sugar.
[321:48.87]What was that?
[322:01.54]uh oh
[322:27.71]What was that guy's name from the infomercials that taught everybody different languages?
[322:36.94]What was his name?
[322:42.76]Yes.
[322:43.74]The guy that taught other languages that was on the infomercials.
[322:46.46]It was like late night TV in the 90s.
[322:49.72]Muzzy.
[322:50.14]Yeah.
[323:04.13]I was never here.
[323:04.65]Okay, we can ease through.
[323:15.26]I'm trying.
[323:21.14]I can't really pause the game right now.
[323:41.90]no no no no keep talking who are you even looking at me something up there
[324:20.55]Can you see?
[324:21.09]I feel like that guy can see still.
[324:23.61]I want to hear this conversation.
[324:26.47]Like, this is going to help.
[324:27.29]Okay.
[324:42.06]Lord Giobbo.
[324:42.78]I love how you actually put your hand up to your ear like that.
[324:47.80]Let's get up.
[324:49.54]What is this?
[325:14.23]Touch Remnant.
[325:15.05]I don't get it.
[325:15.97]I'm going to get invaded.
[325:16.89]Yeah.
[325:49.64]I do.
[325:50.57]I could help.
[325:52.65]Okay.
[325:53.71]Pretty nice remnant.
[325:55.75]Wait.
[325:55.97]Hold on.
[325:56.23]Let's clear this.
[326:16.58]It's probably items down.
[326:17.40]Yeah, there is.
[326:19.64]Alright, fight time.
[326:45.76]Who is... I'm getting those indicators.
[326:51.12]That's thrust.
[326:51.88]Okay.
[326:53.17]Let's see if I can do that well.
[326:59.11]Jesus, man.
[327:00.25]Oh, my.
[327:01.37]Alright, you and me.
[327:08.30]Let's go.
[327:15.73]Yeah, the game did say that that skill was tough.
[327:17.69]You're right.
[327:18.21]You're right.
[327:18.77]I shouldn't... Ooh.
[327:21.76]What is that over there?
[327:23.08]Do we have one of those things?
[327:24.60]We do.
[327:26.58]Sick!
[327:42.73]So I have, uh... Unseen Aid, 13%.
[327:52.36]Well, it's good that I have this.
[327:54.02]So, is there anything else I can do?
[327:55.79]Yeah, there's items over there... Oops, wrong button.
[328:19.01]Stuck.
[328:19.75]I really... Stuck.
[328:29.87]Little hole.
[328:43.78]Alright, who else has a gun?
[328:54.44]That guy does.
[329:02.48]Mm-hmm.
[329:06.06]I feel like, should I kill that... Yeah, I mean, let's go.
[329:14.17]Well, didn't know you were there.
[329:16.73]Don't do this.
[329:22.36]I tried.
[329:24.14]I tried.
[329:30.54]Just heal.
[329:31.20]I just want to see what the... There's an item down there.
[329:44.73]I just don't know.
[329:45.55]Stupid ceramic shards.
[330:04.84]What do we have here?
[330:14.44]Interesting.
[330:17.25]Hold on.
[330:17.61]Is this person going to get up?
[330:36.37]Gunpowder.
[330:37.96]And soon you will be too.
[330:43.66]Ash.
[331:10.29]Good.
[331:10.49]Healing pellets.
[331:12.53]And the door does not open from this side.
[331:14.59]Of course it doesn't.
[331:15.77]Why would it?
[331:17.43]Why would it open?
[331:18.20]There's no reason why it would.
[331:31.45]This is a very large area.
[331:39.04]Will I get hurt falling down here?
[332:04.44]Well, this is very obviously a boss.
[332:06.28]Are we going to get the cutscene, though?
[332:14.22]Oh, there he is.
[332:19.90]Whoa.
[332:20.68]Alright.
[332:21.12]OK.
[332:21.34]Alright.
[332:21.90]Not fair.
[332:22.36]Not fair.
[332:22.90]Not fair.
[332:23.26]Not fair.
[332:25.13]Not fair.
[332:25.51]I need to get up or something.
[332:26.75]I don't know.
[332:27.23]I have no idea.
[332:30.17]Get up?
[332:30.65]Can I jump?
[332:31.65]Can I?
[332:41.51]Right.
[332:59.52]He said gunpowder.
[333:01.44]Can I throw like a bomb or something?
[333:04.04]He's like, my horse!
[333:05.72]Gunpowder for my horse!
[333:25.91]I'm gonna die here.
[333:37.12]I mean, that's pretty cool, but is it enough?
[333:45.70]The horse has to go.
[333:46.50]I don't have any healing.
[333:56.22]Goodbye Uh, somebody else is dying
[334:28.83]So I'm going to try it.
[334:38.73]Do I have anything I could?
[334:40.79]Do I have anything with gunpowder in it?
[335:11.46]Did eat the sugar, too.
[335:12.60]Yeah.
[335:21.47]Well, let me just do it again.
[335:23.45]If I lose... How much money do I have?
[335:26.81]If I lose, do you just... just die?
[335:28.79]I... I'm... I don't know.
[335:30.47]Whatever.
[335:32.71]My name is Kyobu Masataka Oniwa!
[335:41.70]I just said cut off.
[335:44.12]Cut you off.
[335:45.18]Sorry.
[335:47.14]Ow.
[336:06.52]It seems very unfair, but it's still possible.
[336:14.74]No, maybe it's not.
[336:15.44]Don't say that yet.
[336:48.06]Come here.
[336:50.24]Get off the horse.
[336:51.68]Let's go.
[336:52.10]No, never mind.
[337:10.99]That's worth a try.
[337:21.30]Oof, I timed that wrong.
[337:25.28]It's definitely possible, but... I'm definitely missing something.
[337:37.35]I feel like I could actually do it.
[337:46.22]Hmm...
[337:50.10]But for the purposes of... Where else can I go?
[337:53.18]I gotta go back to Drunk Guy.
[338:01.29]I could try to kill him without Secret Item.
[338:09.03]Go kill... Go fight Drunk Guy.
[338:10.87]Wasn't there someone else back here?
[338:12.05]I feel like I missed something back here.
[338:19.24]No, I can kill him.
[338:20.62]I'm killing the horse guy.
[338:25.12]I can do it.
[338:28.50]I have faith.
[338:30.26]Let me use some of the items that I'm not using at all.
[338:34.36]You know what I mean?
[338:37.62]I have all this stuff.
[338:39.30]Shave it!
[338:39.70]Shave it!
[338:40.06]Shave it!
[338:40.46]Might as well just use it.
[338:41.08]Attack power.
[338:44.15]Vitality damage.
[338:45.13]Let's just eat one of these.
[338:51.24]Can I have more than one at a time?
[338:57.98]Pellets on.
[339:01.69]I'm going to give it one more try.
[339:04.05]I'm going to give it two more tries.
[339:06.01]Without using any items.
[339:12.77]I'm going to give it a go.
[339:22.69]Alright, we're gonna go up, and then right here.
[339:33.79]Comes out of here.
[339:34.43]Alright, let's do it.
[339:36.25]What about for this shit?
[339:37.19]I wonder if this is, like, worth using.
[339:38.97]Not really.
[339:54.96]He got some reach.
[340:04.60]Fuck, I didn't see that.
[340:11.19]Fuck.
[340:11.85]Bad start.
[340:12.81]Really bad start.
[340:13.95]Shit.
[340:15.19]Ayayay.
[340:18.85]He just moves around so fast.
[340:24.32]I still am trying to wrap my brain around when to resurrect and when not to resurrect.
[340:29.65]Something tells me I'm doing this very wrong.
[340:34.87]Fuck.
[340:36.23]God.
[341:02.05]Just don't res unless you legit think you can kill him.
[341:05.63]Yeah.
[341:08.51]Let me try it again.
[341:09.37]Can I step on the spear?
[341:20.51]I don't think so.
[341:21.09]I don't get a prompt for it.
[341:26.03]My name is Kyobu Masataka!
[341:38.93]What's your name again?
[341:39.59]I need more of this.
[342:01.06]Back out, back out, back out, back out, back out, back out!
[342:21.27]I can probably jump on that.
[342:33.21]Back back back ba ba ba ba ba buh buh buh buh buh.
[342:42.00]Oh wowee.
[342:54.06]Let's go.
[342:54.52]Alright.
[342:58.14]I'm gonna take one of these right now.
[343:00.65]Phase 2.
[343:08.27]Whoa, what was the... What the fuck are you doing?
[343:25.30]Back up, back up, back up.
[343:26.58]Take another one.
[343:36.17]Ah, you're killing me.
[343:36.71]Don't go that far.
[343:37.41]Am I burning in the fire?
[344:18.77]Nah, I don't think so.
[344:28.77]Goodbye.
[344:29.85]Fuck off.
[344:31.23]Yeah!
[344:43.18]Shinobi execution.
[344:48.97]memory giobu oniwa the battle memory of an extraordinary foe lingering in the mind of the wolf commune with the sculptor's idol and confront memories of battle to permanently increase attack power keeper of ashina castle gate mechanical barrel a mechanical metal barrel that can be given to the sculptor to enable prosthetic tool upgrades
[345:17.44]fits perfectly inside the wrist okay so after almost six hours of playing I started to realize that you don't have to just parry every attack
[345:48.78]That's why I beat him there.
[345:52.58]Not really.
[345:54.11]It does help, but you don't have to.
[345:57.93]I was under the impression that you had to do that.
[346:07.08]It makes you look cool.
[346:08.10]Yeah, it does.
[346:13.72]You can just block...
[346:16.37]And then parry, parry, block, swing, swing, block.
[346:21.51]And you can dodge.
[346:22.55]I was trying to go a little too fast with it in regards to... Perfect parry, perfect parry, perfect parry, swing, swing, swing, swing.
[346:30.50]You don't have to do that.
[346:38.83]Okay, so I have...
[346:47.06]Prosthetic tool upgrades.
[346:48.20]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[346:50.83]Upgraded tools can be created.
[346:55.49]Now I should... Okay, that's another level up.
[346:57.58]Cool.
[346:57.76]Is there anything else here that I can do?
[347:17.11]I think I'm good here.
[347:21.98]Unless I can get up there, which I don't think I can.
[347:23.70]Wait.
[347:35.09]What's in there?
[347:35.89]Might as well.
[347:48.02]But wait a minute.
[347:48.60]Should... Can I put this in the Buddha and... Should I not use this yet?
[348:24.65]Let's just do it.
[348:34.58]The battle memory of an extraordinary foe, although distant, recollection of such a memory provided sustenance for the wolf.
[348:42.36]Oniwa once led a group of infamous bandits, but was defeated by Isshin, who was so captivated by his show of strength that he took him in as an Ashini warrior.
[348:51.98]Oniwa would later go on to become Genichiro, Ashina's most trusted retainer.
[348:57.11]Attack power has been enhanced.
[349:12.15]Weirdly enough.
[349:12.81]Okay.
[349:17.55]Let me go back to the temple, give this upgraded thing.
[349:32.04]So you can't hold on to more than one.
[349:38.77]I see you've acquired something quite interesting.
[349:42.09]A mechanical barrel.
[349:43.91]It's a mechanism that can serve as the very core of the prosthetic.
[349:48.10]Hand it here.
[349:49.00]I'll fit it to the arm for you.
[349:51.28]What difference does the barrel make?
[349:53.42]With a versatile base such as this, I can use various purifying agents to further hone that bag of yours.
[350:00.78]Purifying agents?
[350:02.50]Purifying agents are materials that can be used to... Gunpowder, scrap metal.
[350:07.81]Gunpowder and scrap metal.
[350:10.25]So if you find something of that sort, be sure to bring it my way.
[350:15.85]I do have a lot of those things.
[350:18.33]I don't have any more tools, do I?
[350:23.82]No, but I do have... Upgrade materials and send can be spent to create upgraded versions of tools.
[350:36.57]You must own the base tool and also complete any prerequisite upgrades.
[350:43.19]Okay.
[350:46.13]So we've got...
[350:50.69]unknown tool look at this spring loaded axe unknown shuriken it's like Monster Hunter spring load flame vent I can't do any of these yet very cool okay
[351:21.43]That... I already did.
[351:30.63]So... Now... Now I'm gonna try to go back and do Fat Guy.
[351:35.73]I have no money.
[351:46.90]Unless there's some... Hold on, let me see.
[351:51.48]This is the castle gate.
[351:53.10]Is there something else I missed here?
[351:54.16]Yeah, it didn't open this door.
[352:12.81]Why is sub only on?
[352:13.83]Uh, I don't know.
[352:15.35]People were kind of going crazy in the first, like, hour or two of the stream.
[352:19.24]So, figured maybe we'd chill it out for a little while.
[352:23.78]So we're just going to keep going.
[352:25.14]Progress.
[352:33.74]Oh, right.
[352:38.43]Give me a vase.
[352:55.54]I wish sub only mode was on all the time.
[352:57.86]Things are chill and I can read messages.
[353:01.22]I think it has a time and a place for it.
[353:05.33]Something like this is not really...
[353:19.57]brand new FromSoftware game I think you know warrants maybe it being on for the sake of you know somebody's vaccinating like crazy or saying spoilers or stuff like that you know it's kind of it's by design right alright let's get let me see
[353:50.32]I guess we're going to go this way.
[353:54.90]Spoilers.
[353:59.47]Anything else up here?
[354:01.47]I want to get over there.
[354:09.49]Can I... Nope.
[354:17.64]That's just not going to happen, is it?
[354:20.92]I'm gonna have to go on the roof from here.
[354:29.26]That's more like it.
[354:36.23]More attack power candy.
[354:40.67]Can only hold so much of it every-
[354:52.58]What?
[354:53.26]Really?
[354:53.64]I mean, I jumped into it.
[354:55.82]I... That's not fair.
[354:57.50]I just got Kaizo blocked.
[355:13.91]Well, I'm kind of being sloppy now.
[355:17.46]Yeah, look at how just sloppy I'm being.
[355:19.64]I used 5000% of my brain power on that last boss.
[355:23.62]I'm dead.
[355:25.37]I'm just gonna die.
[355:27.01]I don't want to use the resurrect.
[355:41.93]Okay, let's try this again.
[355:58.89]Alright, so... Let's take a look at this before I just sloppily just run out naked.
[356:09.71]Two guys down here.
[356:14.07]Something over here too.
[356:14.95]Uh, let's go over this way.
[356:18.57]The Black Hat Badger won't go down without a fight.
[356:44.42]Thanks for the info.
[356:49.56]Okay, I thought these guys were just chumps, and they're not at all.
[356:54.41]They're very... Okay, they're very talented.
[356:57.87]I thought they were just... Okay.
[357:02.34]I'm gonna die again.
[357:15.85]I have to actually take their... Oh, boy.
[357:25.76]Oh, boy, oh, boy.
[357:35.81]I gotta take the actual health down.
[357:37.63]I can't even tell when they're attacking!
[357:54.50]Just die again.
[358:01.11]It's possible we're getting close to gamer fatigue.
[358:04.07]It's very possible.
[358:19.70]Yeah, when you make mistakes like that, like literally, there's like a cinder block in my brain right now.
[358:28.16]Let me go back here for a second.
[358:35.67]Okay, that was a car on top of another car.
[358:39.55]There's no way that wasn't just a triple-decker car.
[358:41.81]And the car on top, even though isn't moving, is in neutral, was holding the gas down.
[359:05.37]Can I go up there?
[359:06.13]Do I know this person?
[359:33.89]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[359:34.71]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[359:35.63]Somebody in here.
[359:47.52]What?
[359:47.78]Is it a chest?
[359:48.76]Whoa!
[359:50.74]It's like some person?
[359:52.92]Why is he taking his head through?
[359:54.14]Oh, I can sell here.
[359:55.46]OK.
[360:23.94]Why would you buy money?
[360:29.28]That'll be 550 coins for 500- for money.
[360:33.88]For a bag of money.
[360:34.90]It's because it's money?
[360:38.59]What is this?
[360:43.33]Using it will slightly increase resurrective power.
[360:46.09]Restore the power of life to those who have been drained of it by offering this drop to the sculptor's idol with the recovery charm in hand.
[360:55.16]In turn, all afflicted with the dragon rot will be healed.
[361:03.13]Okay.
[361:11.64]Uh.
[361:14.56]I kind of need this.
[361:24.55]Sell the coin purse.

[361:37.99]Sell it.
[361:38.40]Buy it back.
[361:38.94]Sell it.
[361:39.24]Buy it back.
[361:44.90]Let me use one of these pouches here.
[361:47.10]How many do I have?
[361:47.74]A lot.
[361:51.30]What do you get for it?
[361:55.37]100.

[362:23.61]Oh, okay.
[362:24.59]Alright, alright.
[362:28.97]Damn, I didn't even see those.
[362:30.41]Okay, so... How much do I get for this?
[362:35.93]500?
[362:35.95]1,000?
[362:37.11]This is gonna be 500, right?
[363:05.23]I'll take it.
[363:07.27]So now... Do I have anything else I can sell?
[363:10.38]No.
[363:13.30]I need coins.
[363:22.12]I got another gourd, which is good.
[363:24.23]There's somebody else down here.
[363:33.83]This guy moved.

[370:39.39]Take medicine?
[370:39.89]I already took Dayquil, like, five hours ago.
[370:42.85]You only take that shit, like, once every ten to twelve hours.
[370:51.16]Alright, let's see.
[370:51.86]So, enhance physical attributes.
[370:54.92]Enhance physical attributes.
[370:56.98]Do it.
[371:04.63]Strung together in offering to a sculptor's idol.
[371:09.00]Maximum vitality and posture.
[371:10.44]Nice.
[371:18.29]max vitality and posture both increased good I'm very happy about this let's go deal with the rats you take a every 10 to 12 hours sometimes sometimes that happens
[371:49.97]Alright, where were those little guys?
[371:51.76]They were, like, up this way, right?
[372:00.80]Where were those little mushroom dudes?
[372:05.04]Little, like, little guys.
[372:06.02]Over here.
[372:18.61]No, other way.
[372:25.40]Did I beat the horseman?
[372:26.38]I did.
[372:26.74]I did.
[372:30.09]He was... He was pretty cool.
[372:36.57]Well, I'm gonna have this... Is it up here?
[372:44.69]Need a Vroom emote at this point.
[372:47.69]Yeah, but... A Vroom emote...
[372:53.81]They get used all the time.
[372:59.66]Okay, they're over here.
[373:00.66]There we go.
[373:01.14]Okay.
[373:02.58]Let's fight the... where are they?
[373:07.74]There's one here.
[373:08.44]He's facing this direction.
[373:18.41]There's one.
[373:21.31]That's the point of Imhot.
[373:23.94]Yes, I know.
[373:33.97]Black Gunpowder!
[373:35.19]Good.
[373:38.29]Get off me, get off me, get off me.
[373:43.49]Is it weird that I want somebody to do that to me?
[373:47.24]It's like Looney Tunes.
[373:54.19]Every bone in my back.
[373:55.48]Alright.
[374:03.26]How many more?
[374:03.72]Is there another one?
[374:11.91]Did it say how many there were?
[374:18.23]Last seen around the castle gate.
[374:23.29]Oops.
[374:25.44]I think that's it.
[374:41.99]Unless it's somewhere here, which I don't see.
[374:44.21]There's only three, I think.
[374:59.26]Let's see what he says.
[375:03.10]Is this guy just gonna give me kill quests?
[375:14.30]Imagine finding out your neighbor is not only a streamer but is obsessed with you and has an emote dedicated to you because you drive loud.
[375:33.38]uh I knew you had a talent for killing wonderful here's your reward apart from my arm oh machina style skills it's a whole another tree this is the ways of the ashina blade it's our school of fighting but there are no hard and fast rules you just win your battles
[376:02.73]Yeah.
[376:02.99]You just win.
[376:03.63]Somebody mentioned this was chat earlier.
[376:05.71]They're, uh...
[376:31.02]They were completely correct.
[376:31.99]They were absolutely right.
[376:33.05]Okay, here's... Ashina?
[376:37.15]I guess I have to be sitting down?
[376:47.58]It's not a big deal.
[376:48.44]You just win.
[376:55.96]Well... Okay.
[376:57.22]Okay.
[376:59.27]I wonder if I'm good enough to attempt Fat Guy again.
[377:04.29]I'm gonna try.
[377:17.52]As you know.
[377:21.92]Delivers a heavy one-hit overhead strike.
[377:25.34]High posture damage and also recovers one's own posture with a strong forward step.
[377:32.16]Single-minded mastery is the heart of the Ashina style.
[377:35.74]Strength.
[377:38.57]Such as one big, huge, heavy swing.
[377:54.99]I gotta pick something and stick with it.
[378:01.87]Here's your replayability that people were concerned about.
[378:05.27]I don't know if you can get all these.
[378:08.11]Maybe you can only do one of these trees and maybe some of the other ones.
[378:12.42]I don't know.
[378:15.40]But this to me looks like replayability.
[378:23.34]But I'm going to... I don't know.
[378:41.11]End of the stream?
[378:41.81]No, no.
[378:42.11]I'm trying to decide on what I want to do with my points.
[378:46.70]Should I try this?
[378:47.72]Should I just do this all the way?
[378:51.40]There's a slash, and then there's a power up, power up.
[378:54.16]They're all power ups.
[379:11.01]This is the parry.
[379:13.91]Do something.
[379:15.06]I'm going to take my time.
[379:16.88]I want to make sure it's what I want to do.
[379:18.10]I'm not just going to go as fast as I can or hurry up
[379:27.32]So when you deflect, it increases damage done to their posture from all sources.
[379:32.32]That's great.
[379:37.16]So this is deflect every move.
[379:43.94]Let's put this up and see what it looks like.
[379:56.27]That takes a while.
[380:00.25]Wow, that's... It's going to be hard to do.
[380:10.25]Let's go try to fight the drunk guy.
[380:18.08]I'm going to be slow.
[380:19.10]I'm going to clear it out.
[380:21.68]This is where we want to be.
[380:28.89]After this, I'm probably going to take a break.
[380:34.61]And we're going to start tomorrow.
[380:37.21]Probably early again tomorrow.
[380:43.44]I've leveled up twice.
[380:45.42]Well, once, technically, right?
[380:48.60]Let's just see if I can do this shit.
[380:50.32]Where did this go?
[380:59.80]Oh.
[381:01.44]Right.
[381:02.08]No, no, no.
[381:02.78]I'm not going... Let me work backwards.
[381:08.01]And I say that because I want to fight the wizard.
[381:23.04]He's the real boss of the night for me.
[381:36.04]I can't really tell what that was, but it doesn't matter.
[381:52.19]Mm-hmm.
[382:08.25]The boss was the friends we made along the way.
[382:10.49]I mean, yeah.
[382:19.17]Okay.
[382:20.67]Clear.
[382:22.15]Now, where was the wizard?
[382:28.30]Asshole.
[382:41.31]Alright.
[382:42.39]So there was a way to go down.
[382:45.49]I panicked around here, and I just started sprinting in random directions.
[382:53.00]There's a cave.
[382:54.56]That was the cave I just came down, though.
[383:06.36]Where is that guy?
[383:09.65]Here?
[383:10.01]Okay, it was down here.
[383:12.45]Alright, let's go.
[383:14.34]Me versus the wizard.
[383:15.26]I'm ready.
[383:36.76]Fuck, I was waiting.
[383:37.64]Okay, so that was a sweep.
[383:59.58]Got him.
[384:01.76]Is there more than one wizard?
[384:04.72]Yeah, there is.
[384:05.24]There's a bunch of them.
[384:06.85]They're just a regular enemy.
[384:19.66]What?
[384:20.06]I didn't block it?
[384:21.12]No, I blocked it.
[384:23.72]Fuck you.
[384:24.48]What?
[384:26.62]You can't block thrusts.
[384:40.97]No!
[384:42.29]There's so many mechanics that need to be memorized.
[384:45.27]Fuck.
[384:48.70]Dodge, parry, jump.
[384:51.86]Rock, paper, scissor.
[384:54.52]I have to go down there.
[384:55.56]I don't even know where the fuck I am right now.
[385:17.52]I killed the first spear guy.
[385:18.92]Now I have to do all this shit.
[385:27.82]You know what?
[385:28.44]I don't care.
[385:29.10]I'm just gonna run by these fucking people.
[385:31.39]I'm just gonna run by the first wizard.
[385:35.41]I just wanna see what's down here.
[385:38.29]I don't wanna fight 10, 15 people.
[385:42.49]What's even down here?
[385:49.54]Did that really just happen?
[385:57.19]Get it, get it, get it, get it!
[385:57.97]Okay.
[386:04.63]That's it?
[386:05.03]I got it.
[386:05.51]I did it.
[386:37.30]No, oh my god.
[386:40.76]Just the, ugh, the back and forth with the fucking dash, the fucking, it's just, you have to just fucking muscle memory memorize it, and it takes a long time.
[386:50.34]No, that's wrong, but I'm still gonna kill him.
[387:10.20]Like, I had a ton of money on him.
[387:12.44]Thank God I did this.
[387:20.69]Just my brain has trouble when that little indicator pops up.
[387:23.83]It's almost like I'm in... It's like playing Batman, right?
[387:25.91]You're waiting for that to happen.
[387:27.83]But also, on top of waiting for that to happen, you need to, like, play the game, too.
[387:32.39]Because think about when... Batman... You can just wait for that to pop up and just press Y and be done.
[387:39.92]You gotta, like, be aware of everything going on and wait for the Batman signal.
[387:44.04]And it's one of three different Batman potential counters.
[387:50.39]This game really makes you feel like Batman.
[387:54.77]I'm dead here.
[387:55.31]I gotta bone out of here.
[388:07.02]Just don't let this guy kill me and then bone out.
[388:26.16]He's a slow guy, he's gonna end it.
[388:30.18]He's gonna end it.
[388:31.65]Isn't he?
[388:32.23]Isn't he?
[388:32.67]No he's not, don't.
[388:34.55]Do I have any pellets?
[388:37.99]No, don't throw that, that just distracted him.
[388:47.06]Alright, bone out.
[388:51.42]Oh shit, he's gonna end the stream.
[388:59.71]Okay.
[388:59.89]I'm not done yet.
[389:06.83]Where's the door?
[389:07.23]All the way at the bottom.
[389:27.25]Okay, okay.
[389:35.75]That leaves me with... There's two ways for me to go right now.
[389:42.24]I want to try... I want to try to do the drunk guy.
[389:49.72]Just once.
[389:50.79]And then I'm going to rage turn off the string.
[389:59.15]Don't ask me why I boned all the way out here.
[390:12.83]I'm dying of dragon rot.
[390:14.85]Yeah, I know.
[390:18.84]Very appropriate thing to be suffering from right now, right?
[390:21.90]Alright, let's do this.
[390:24.68]Let's just go through... Wait a minute.
[390:28.96]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[390:29.78]Don't I have a seed?
[390:31.46]Didn't I buy a seed?
[390:34.24]Did I already use it?
[390:36.14]Did I use that seed that I bought?
[390:43.71]I don't remember using it.
[390:44.49]Maybe I did.
[390:57.14]You piece of crap.
[390:59.96]You piece of crap, seriously.
[391:01.58]I didn't use it, did I?
[391:07.14]Wouldn't it be in my inventory?
[391:10.96]No.
[391:11.44]I gotta go use this.
[391:32.36]And should I heal everybody's rod, or should I wait till they're just barely dead and then resurrect them?
[391:50.27]Your house is on fire.
[391:54.91]Well, let's heal them.
[392:01.28]Up.
[392:05.98]Is this healing them?
[392:07.70]No.
[392:08.52]That's the wrong thing.
[392:11.90]What do I... I gotta give to his Buddha a wrong thing.
[392:20.90]You have to actually do it at the bonfire.
[392:25.01]Oh, I thought it said use it at his Buddha thing.
[392:48.38]Did he just use it?
[392:49.96]Did he just use it?
[392:53.70]Hopefully, this is not a mistake.
[393:04.34]Offer?
[393:04.68]Okay.
[393:05.95]Restore the power of light to those who have been drained of it by offering this drop to the sculptor's idol with the recovery charm in hand.
[393:11.85]So I need... I need the recovery charm.
[393:30.31]Alright, these are all things to consider for tomorrow.
[393:34.55]But I want to just try to fight this guy.
[393:48.56]I'll give him one solid attempt.
[393:58.94]Then I've gotta go.
[393:59.64]I'm gonna cry.
[394:01.32]I'm gonna get some food.
[394:02.90]I wanted to go a little bit longer, because I still want to play.
[394:05.83]But... Of course, of course I get cursed with getting sick.
[394:15.23]The day before one of the biggest releases of the year, and not only that, one of the most anticipated releases for me that I've wanted to play.
[394:23.04]I slid under that.
[394:27.03]Just stop being sick.
[394:27.91]I wish it were that easy.
[394:38.93]See, this part, like, my goodness.
[394:42.67]Because you have to get rid of these guys, otherwise they'll just keep coming.
[394:47.62]Alright, come behind the wall here.
[394:52.52]There's people shooting the arrows.
[394:59.33]Does these guys run across the whole lake?
[395:01.55]We've done it like three times and it happens every time.
[395:08.78]Can't you stealth?
[395:09.66]Not here.
[395:10.14]It's a big open field.
[395:23.26]You can run past them?
[395:24.08]Well, every time I run past them, they just run across the lake and I get hit by four or five people coming from behind.
[395:34.20]It's happened the last three times we tried it.
[395:48.81]Yeah, on the roof.
[395:50.23]You can run by them on the roof.
[395:53.20]But there's always a few that aggro.
[395:54.34]I'm just gonna kill them all.
[395:55.66]I want no variables.
[396:17.73]Maybe through the building here to the right.
[396:19.37]Maybe you can walk through the building, like on top and then around.
[396:35.14]I have two heals.
[396:38.28]There shouldn't be anybody left.
[396:40.85]Let's go try to do this.
[396:43.57]I'm going to really seriously attempt it.
[396:48.15]Let's go talk to this guy.
[396:49.85]Maybe should I... Can I pull these guys first?
[396:55.31]I wonder.
[396:58.79]Because all these...
[397:03.38]Let's go.
[397:10.03]Archers first.
[397:16.59]Okay, not bad.
[397:27.40]I'll handle this.
[397:29.26]You take care of him.
[397:36.69]Alright, let's go!
[397:37.19]Let's go!
[397:37.51]Let's go!
[397:37.83]Let's get him!
[397:38.23]Get him!
[397:38.51]Together!
[397:46.82]Can I heal him?
[397:54.16]I don't even know what just hit me.
[398:05.55]Oh, that's a jump, it's a sweep.
[398:23.02]Two punches in a row.
[398:33.77]Do I have any more healing?
[398:34.55]Anything?
[398:42.04]I'm fucked.
[398:52.96]Nope, I'm in trouble.
[398:53.80]I'm dead.
[398:57.71]I'm gonna try it.
[398:58.25]Let's come back.
[399:25.41]Didn't get it.
[399:32.06]Mmm, it's definitely doable.
[399:34.08]No heals.
[399:38.88]I'm so concerned with taking that guy's money.
[399:45.78]No.
[399:49.31]Come on, I can do it!
[399:58.14]How many times is he gonna...
[400:14.84]What's that dude?
[400:16.08]Whoa
[400:57.46]God damn it.
[400:58.72]It was so close to double kill I Tried to dodge the double tap.
[401:13.88]Oh, no, I have to do all this bullshit again Slapping ass cheeks in anger.
[401:21.53]Oh
[401:23.26]God, I've never concentrated more in a game than like that.
[401:26.84]I had it, too.
[401:30.36]It was so close.
[401:37.66]It's definitely doable.
[401:38.76]But fuck, man.
[401:39.62]That was... I was like two hits away.
[401:41.30]Just that string is so strange.
[401:45.80]It's like Champion Gundyr.
[401:47.42]That's what it reminds me of.
[401:57.44]When Champion Gunder does that little, like... Pain in the ass.
[402:03.46]Alright, come on.
[402:13.50]See what I mean, though?
[402:15.14]That motherfucker right there is not going to stop.
[402:22.65]That guy, he's got a bow.
[402:23.41]He's going to turn and he's going to shoot me.
[402:28.72]Let's see.
[402:30.92]That indicator is going to be on the screen the whole time.
[402:35.40]Thank God.
[402:36.70]Alright, let's go.
[402:37.31]I'm ready.
[402:37.69]I'm ready.
[402:38.03]I'm ready.
[402:38.29]Let's go.
[402:38.63]I'm ready.
[402:38.91]Let's go.
[402:39.25]Let's go.
[402:39.59]Let's do it.
[402:39.95]Let's go.
[402:42.11]Make it quick.
[403:30.66]Alright, easy.
[403:32.18]I got four heals.
[403:33.60]Let's go, you drunk fuck.
[403:38.82]That's gonna fuck me every time.
[403:45.73]I'm on the ground, dude.
[404:01.54]Can you not parry his hand?
[404:03.32]Fuck.
[404:11.20]Sloppy.
[404:20.31]You can?
[404:20.87]I just tried.
[404:21.77]This is a really, really, really bad attempt.
[404:43.87]No, it was a sweep.
[404:47.69]Jesus Christ.
[404:53.90]Just kill me.
[405:14.42]I'm gonna kill this guy before it threw the stream off.
[405:16.18]It's gonna happen.
[405:24.97]I know it is.
[405:29.07]But it doesn't mean it's not frustrating as hell trying to kill this guy.
[405:35.98]I'm gonna do it.
[405:36.82]It's gonna happen eventually.
[405:37.86]I know it.
[405:47.50]Okay.
[405:52.18]If I go up there without him, then I aggro everybody.
[405:54.97]Especially, even the drunk guy.
[405:57.15]So I have to take him with me.
[406:08.94]You got to this part in two hours?
[406:11.12]Well, so did I. But I went and did two other bosses and came back here.
[406:28.21]I think it's time.
[406:30.89]I don't even care.
[406:31.35]I'm going for it.
[406:31.89]I'm using these things.
[406:44.26]So this is attack power.
[406:45.42]I feel like I'm just going to use this.
[406:52.43]Like, right now.
[406:57.61]Go!
[407:08.22]Wah!
[407:12.04]Hey, you have to really...
[407:18.70]I got this dumb aggro right now.
[407:20.74]Actually, probably for the best.
[407:21.78]I don't think he'll die to these guys.
[407:24.65]Really?
[407:26.43]He might.
[407:40.33]Alright.
[407:41.21]Easy.
[407:49.53]I don't know why I did that, but I decided to do it for some reason.
[407:58.76]He's gonna die here.
[408:06.24]I don't even know what even killed him.
[408:20.18]I thought he was done.
[408:27.54]Nope.
[408:29.59]Not enough.
[408:31.23]Go drink.
[408:33.69]Get it!
[408:38.09]Get it!
[408:38.39]Get it!
[408:53.62]Oh my god, there's so much breaking up my posture!
[409:28.28]Oh, it hurts.
[409:29.38]Back up, back up, back up, back up.
[409:30.76]No, not the palm.
[409:32.14]Anything but the palm.
[409:33.82]Triple quadruple palm?
[409:36.24]Quadruple bypass palm.
[409:52.20]Wait a minute.
[409:53.18]Who is this guy?
[409:56.42]You shitting me?
[409:58.67]No, he's just drinking for free!
[410:10.07]No, no, no, no, no!
[410:10.97]Anything but that!
[410:11.82]Anything but that!
[410:12.86]Anything but that!
[410:16.02]It's over!
[410:29.09]Unrefined Sake.
[410:31.51]A bottle of cloudy, unrefined sake.
[410:33.13]Sake is a drink meant for sharing.
[410:35.19]This cloudy sake is one of Isshan Ishida's favorites.
[410:41.08]And his reputation for getting one too drunk too quick.
[410:44.52]And privies.
[410:46.70]Alright.
[410:52.72]Okay.
[410:53.80]I did it.
[410:54.86]Yes.
[410:56.94]Ooh, that was rough.
[410:59.50]And that's just, like, the third mini-boss.
[411:02.96]There's been one real boss, and then two or three mini-bosses, and, man... They're pretty rough.
[411:17.99]So let me see... Can I go... I can go... This... This is, like, the first act.
[411:25.97]I told you I was gonna do it.
[411:27.01]I just have to try... You have to just relax...
[411:47.30]What's in here?
[411:50.02]Pellet.
[412:05.01]It's over.
[412:07.15]It is.
[412:08.71]It's over.
[412:10.09]There's nothing else in here.
[412:11.13]There's only a couple of random dudes.
[412:14.44]And then... We'll come across... You know what?
[412:18.80]Just fight him.
[412:19.82]I've come this far.
[412:23.48]What's the worst that you could do right now?
[412:31.40]Oil.
[412:31.58]Oil.
[412:52.23]Thank God I can... Oh my God, there's a thing here.
[412:56.19]Just open this.
[413:06.00]I got three points.
[413:14.06]I like that.
[413:20.15]So I'm going to get both of these.
[413:23.20]So this is more posture damage when you deflect.
[413:26.56]And after a deflect, you just do more posture damage.
[413:31.56]Yeah, sure.
[413:32.42]Absolutely.
[413:44.73]Nice.
[413:50.54]Rest here.
[413:51.08]Okay.
[414:02.37]Hello.
[414:08.05]Son of a... What?
[414:26.16]The young master is deep in the mansion.
[414:28.90]My son, Inosuke, went to rescue him.
[414:32.96]So he's probably fine.
[414:35.98]But you never know.
[414:38.37]The young master might need you, Rokinomi.
[414:42.65]Okay.
[414:43.31]Anything else?
[414:44.31]The young master is deep in the mansion.
[414:48.23]Items.
[414:50.55]Okay.
[414:52.71]Young master cutscene.
[414:59.41]I rested already, right?
[415:00.33]Just in case I didn't.
[415:04.00]What do I have?
[415:06.72]$480.
[415:08.60]I'm resting here, right?
[415:11.76]Any more items?
[415:12.86]No.
[415:16.75]Well, you just kind of came out of nowhere, didn't you?
[415:23.43]You are so... I'm going to kill that guy with a swing.
[415:25.35]I know it.
[415:27.13]I'm gonna accidentally swipe that guy and hit him right in the head.
[415:32.00]Will you just... Don't let me accidentally kill this dude!
[415:36.62]Alright, here we go.
[415:44.01]What's the deal?
[415:56.42]Dreadful illusion techniques.
[415:59.41]Without a Snapseed, it cannot be overcome.
[416:02.85]I have one of those.
[416:04.57]It's not much.
[416:10.17]I have those.
[416:19.76]An illusion.
[416:23.60]Listen.
[416:25.44]Okay.
[416:25.60]Shift Tatami aside.
[416:26.60]Who?
[416:26.76]Oh.
[416:26.96]I thought Tatami was a person.
[416:58.49]I didn't know tatami was a thing.
[417:06.59]I don't have the key to get in here.
[417:13.19]She paid it.
[417:13.71]That was fun.
[417:19.94]You got a key?
[417:20.62]Sir?
[417:34.49]Well, hey, thanks for coming to the stream.
[417:36.13]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[417:47.46]Guys, I apparently need to get a key for this that I don't have.
[417:50.54]I have absolutely no clue where the hell that could be.
[418:11.68]Let me see what I got here.
[418:20.19]I have, do I have tools to do anything?
[418:22.63]No.
[418:49.04]Uh, it's... I wonder if it's here.
[419:10.70]Alright, um... I have no idea where I'm going, but I'm gonna find it wherever it is.
[419:24.65]Or maybe I'll just die.
[419:25.83]Let's just reset them.
[419:51.74]Just reset them.
[420:01.74]Okay, so now... What?
[420:05.83]The rooster.
[420:40.71]Okay.
[420:41.03]I don't know if... I didn't go down this way.
[420:44.07]This is new.
[420:48.79]I can tell because there's a wizard here.
[420:58.24]That's a... that's a much... That's a strong wizard.
[421:02.26]That's a 2 HP wizard.
[421:19.25]Countering thrusts!
[421:21.79]Yeah, yeah.
[421:22.67]I already got it.
[421:23.91]But that guy's gonna be a pain.
[421:36.86]Countered!
[421:37.24]There's one.
[421:46.07]Again.
[421:48.81]Let's do it again.
[421:53.89]Don't fuck this up by bringing another idiot over here.
[421:56.25]And it's a slow swing guy.
[422:05.59]No!
[422:06.23]Got him.
[422:06.69]Got him.
[422:07.43]He's dead.
[422:12.40]Another prayer bead.
[422:15.16]I only need two more.
[422:33.48]That felt good.
[422:34.02]That felt really good.
[422:40.85]Bird's eye view.
[422:41.41]We got item over here.
[422:49.19]Just pellet.
[422:52.07]And nothing else.
[422:57.51]This is the item balloon.
[423:04.76]Where am I?
[423:09.22]Another sculptor's idol.
[423:13.76]So much for gamer fatigue.
[423:14.96]Apparently, yeah, I guess.
[423:19.16]Sometimes all this liquid has to get drained out of your body before you can refill it with more liquid.
[423:24.98]What?
[423:25.16]I don't know.
[423:38.66]He says, true.
[423:54.65]Ah, true.
[423:57.54]That did it to me, I don't know why.
[424:11.36]Just did.
[424:22.88]Maybe I am getting tired, but that's fine.
[424:32.90]Where am I going?
[424:38.65]Alright, I gotta relax.
[424:40.13]It's not that big of a deal.
[424:41.39]Let's go.
[424:44.23]This really is... Jeremy has TV.
[424:45.59]Oh, God.
[424:50.56]Where did that just take me?
[424:51.90]Into the mist.
[424:53.66]Mist!
[424:55.26]Oh!
[424:56.41]Wow.
[425:09.14]Oh!
[425:10.36]Oh, Rick!
[425:27.94]Get away from me, get away!
[425:37.35]I'm being- hell is raining down on me right now.
[425:41.17]By one guy.
[425:46.35]Anybody else feel like the health pool is lower than in the other From games?
[425:51.24]Oh, there is hellro- it's just- it is- it's actually four guys.
[426:02.45]Motherfucker, you're better with a sword than you are a bow!
[426:18.65]Oil.
[426:20.64]There's a guy with intestines coming out of his stomach.
[426:22.18]Okay, this is a fight.
[426:47.42]You came up a little short.
[426:48.60]Maybe you should try that again.
[426:56.86]That's a sweep.
[426:57.48]That's a sweep.
[426:58.14]He's a sweeper.
[427:04.58]I think a side dodge is better than... Oh, he baseball swung up?!
[427:13.41]My lord, that's heavy.
[427:22.22]He caught me in the air.
[427:23.10]That was actually pretty good on his part.
[427:29.80]Yeah, I don't think I should try to parry that.
[427:31.38]Just dodge.
[427:34.52]Forehead.
[427:54.46]Guys with bows are really, really, really bad in this game.
[427:59.26]Okay, here's what they did.
[428:00.22]FromSoftware took the dog.
[428:02.35]And yeah, the dog sucks in every FromSoftware game.
[428:04.87]Let's make the dogs not a big deal, but bow and arrow guys used to be a joke.
[428:09.93]The arrow used to shoot... Like, slower than it does in Minecraft.
[428:16.05]Now these guys are not a joke.
[428:17.09]They replaced these.
[428:17.79]This is the new dog.
[428:26.48]These guys have guns sometimes now.
[428:45.01]Like, seriously, it was a big deal if somebody shot you in any of the other FromSoftware games with a bow.
[428:49.76]Because they may as well have blue plate specials you from Tribes.
[428:56.16]It was an embarrassment if you got hit by a bow or an arrow in those games.
[429:06.14]Okay, hold on.
[429:17.12]Somebody's gonna... Alright, wait a minute.
[429:26.90]No, that's... There's no dad fight.
[429:28.26]That's just dad.
[429:30.49]Dad's huge.
[429:33.53]It's you.
[429:35.15]I'm afraid I... made a bit of a blunder.
[429:39.35]Made a little bit of a blunder.
[429:42.61]I turned on the gas and it gets you...
[429:47.18]I was going to make a fucking tuna melt.
[429:51.70]But I fell asleep on the couch.
[429:53.28]It was a long day of killing.
[429:54.80]You must take this.
[430:02.99]Alright.
[430:05.37]Here's the key.
[430:06.75]Key to the hidden temple in the Hirata estate given by the owl.
[430:15.04]You inconsiderate fuck.
[430:26.38]Hold on.
[430:27.02]This one's been building for a while.
[430:35.83]The very back of the estate, I know where it is.
[430:37.77]Two, the Lord is absolute.
[430:38.99]Defend him with your life.
[430:39.89]If he is taken, bring him back at any cost.
[430:41.65]This is the key to the secret temple.
[430:45.08]In the estate mansion, you'll find him.
[430:48.52]No one ever told me to not put utensils in the microwave.
[430:55.67]I'm trying to heat him up to make it so when I ate my soup, it was nice and warm.
[430:59.05]Yes.
[430:59.99]Return to the estate entrance.
[431:03.87]Then look for a side road along the cliffs.
[431:06.53]Take the back entrance through the cemetery.
[431:10.69]That's your way in.
[431:12.37]Understood.
[431:13.33]Wolf.
[431:33.55]I'm not laughing at that.
[431:39.25]Wait, why did the fire get worse?
[431:46.58]Somebody talked about how they do that with ice cream.
[431:51.76]You warm up your utensils so you can eat ice cream easier.
[432:01.02]It's like, that's genius, but what the fuck?
[432:04.51]So what, you put warm water, like, under the sink?
[432:09.61]I've never even thought about that.
[432:11.19]Sometimes I let the ice cream just sit on the counter for like three hours because it's too cold to eat.
[432:17.88]And I never thought for a second just to take a spoon and like put hot water on it.
[432:25.67]Why don't you just chisel out any little ice cream chips?
[432:29.00]And then you get sick of it and you throw it... That hurts.
[432:36.14]Where do I need to go?
[432:36.88]Sneak?
[432:39.34]I'm just boning out of here.
[432:44.64]Head to my left and follow the cliff.
[432:53.41]Whose left?
[432:54.03]My left or your left?
[433:07.70]There might be an item or two that I missed from here.
[433:11.38]Might as well just do it.
[433:13.66]Yeah, it's possible.
[433:16.67]Jump down there.
[433:21.39]We're gonna miss, like, the weird jumping from, like, Monopoly house to Monopoly house, right?
[433:28.39]That's cool.
[433:30.32]That's cool, you know?
[433:32.40]Ah, that's pretty cool.
[433:36.76]Alright, here we are.
[433:37.40]I can bone out of here.
[433:52.16]Just wanted to see if there's anything that I missed on the left.
[434:02.45]When did I stop taking the stream seriously?
[434:04.27]I'm...
[434:05.77]I'm still taking it seriously.
[434:18.14]Alright, here we go.
[434:22.32]Is there anything I can... I have $964.
[434:25.36]I think I'm gonna... Where's the guy that I can buy stuff from?
[434:31.65]Somewhere in here, right?
[434:34.55]No, where are they?
[434:35.51]You're like up here.
[434:40.03]I got money, and if this is a major boss that I'm going to lose to over and over again, I might as well use this money.
[434:53.62]Okay, so... Is it up this way?
[434:58.74]I know there was a couple of NPCs up here.
[435:02.26]No, this is progressing further.
[435:19.50]What about this way?
[435:22.02]Maybe?
[435:25.55]Possibly.
[435:31.01]Because this goes up into...
[435:37.12]the rat guy, and then over here.
[435:41.32]Yeah.
[435:42.28]Hi.
[435:45.74]I do want to purchase something.
[435:47.06]Yes, I do.
[435:48.26]I'm going to get the firecrackers.
[435:53.12]Because it's just another thing to try.
[435:54.51]Maybe I should just buy a bunch of this stuff.
[436:01.84]Why would you purchase a coin?
[436:03.36]I guess maybe just... Yeah, you know what?
[436:07.00]Let's do it.
[436:08.12]Let's do it.
[436:08.64]Because I understand why you do that.
[436:17.01]It's to store the money so you don't lose it.
[436:18.91]That makes sense.
[436:24.63]What else would you use a coin pouch for?
[436:26.17]In case you die.
[436:28.15]Yeah, that's cool.
[436:29.91]Interesting way to do it.
[436:34.31]Okay.
[436:42.42]I'm ready.
[437:03.28]God, I just love video games.
[437:05.78]Okay.
[437:18.99]Take those seeds.
[437:21.85]Use the key.
[437:24.09]What's behind door number one?
[437:32.25]Oh boy.
[437:48.40]That's a cutscene.
[437:49.72]Father?
[437:51.90]Mother?
[437:55.02]The butterflies.
[437:57.00]Everyone is gone.
[438:01.64]My lord.
[438:02.04]Illusion technique.
[438:08.86]It's been a long time, you son of owl.
[438:16.81]Uh-oh.
[438:20.35]I need Butterfly.
[438:22.05]He's the real magician.
[438:24.16]Leave us.
[438:26.32]Who?
[438:27.42]Arth?
[438:28.80]Do what must be done.
[438:33.68]Yes.
[438:38.87]It looks like an actual wizard battle.
[438:51.29]Now then, son of Al.
[438:57.71]Shall we dance?
[438:58.43]Good luck.
[438:58.71]You look like a shoe.
[439:02.25]That's gonna untie you and you'll be done.
[439:05.67]Uh, vitality and posture, yeah.
[439:09.33]The lower one's vitality, the slower their posture recovers.
[439:11.87]That's right.
[439:12.79]Posture gauges color gets redder as recovery rate slows.
[439:19.64]Fast posture recovery.
[439:20.70]Ideally, I gotta bring her health down.
[439:26.36]Okay.
[439:28.54]Why, Lady Butterfly?
[439:30.00]Why?
[439:32.03]Ah.
[439:41.91]I don't know what that move does.
[439:49.61]Ow.
[439:55.35]I'm assuming it's when she does that, like, big dun-dun.
[440:08.29]Well, was that a grab?
[440:09.91]I can't even tell.
[440:10.63]I'm dead.
[440:11.93]Game over.
[440:15.77]Uh, I... I'm not gonna resurrect.
[440:24.11]Until I have a better idea of what the hell's going on.
[440:34.92]No reason not to?
[440:35.68]Well, it's on a timer, right?
[440:43.42]It's not?
[440:47.97]I thought when you... What about the pie?
[440:49.75]She's just waiting for me.
[440:56.80]Listen.
[440:58.52]So that, once it goes in the air, it's a grab.
[441:00.64]So you just have to dodge it.
[441:02.56]What is that?
[441:03.20]Does that count as a thrust?
[441:06.95]Dear god, I have no idea.
[441:32.57]Damn, it's hard to really get around.
[441:34.07]Okay.
[441:59.63]Not bad.
[442:26.26]Back it up.
[442:35.85]Die!
[442:42.93]Get out of my way.
[442:50.06]Wait a minute!
[442:51.04]The snap peas!
[442:51.62]Snap peas!
[442:54.93]Should I even do this?
[442:56.49]Should I... another attempt?
[443:03.27]So wait, ah, she's... Oh no, but I don't have... I need more healing.
[443:10.52]I don't want to use one of these items.
[443:16.88]I know snappies now, but where... I only have six of them.
[443:19.80]Where do I... where do I get more of them?
[443:20.98]You know what I'm saying?
[443:32.12]I'm not gonna use him until I have a good attempt.
[443:53.31]What?
[443:53.55]I have no reason not to respawn?
[443:57.52]I feel like this ain't going to help me here.
[444:06.57]You can revive once.
[444:07.67]The second one is on the timer.
[444:09.15]Okay, I see.
[444:14.89]Start again.
[444:15.31]I'm not going to use those pellets either.
[444:27.56]Let's try.
[444:27.98]Let's go.
[444:28.30]Hold on.
[444:30.03]I'm all tangled up here.
[444:41.20]Come on.
[444:54.44]Really?
[444:54.74]That sucks.
[444:56.84]That's just a waste of an attempt right here.
[444:58.88]Get out of the way.
[445:19.95]I'm out of posture.
[445:35.00]Eat this.
[445:37.20]That's actually not a bad move to do.
[445:43.38]That... It's so hard to avoid that fucking move.
[445:45.86]You gotta wait till the last possible millisecond.
[445:48.48]Come on.
[446:05.13]Can I, like, spend some money to make that guy never come back?
[446:14.46]Thankfully, this is right here.
[446:15.32]Alright, let's see.
[446:18.78]Do you think I'm gonna die 200 times?
[446:20.64]No.
[446:21.52]I think that's the first time I've seen that move.
[446:41.54]What the fuck, man?
[446:43.48]Oh my god, give me even like a second.
[446:48.07]Oh, even one second.
[446:50.55]One fucking second.
[446:57.95]I didn't even get a chance.
[447:23.87]I'll give you 0.5 seconds.
[447:26.60]I'm gonna give us a few attempts.
[447:28.06]Somebody else is like dying from fucking cough rot.
[447:39.81]Speak of which, there it is.
[447:58.87]This boss is really easy, just make sure you don't get hit and hit her.
[448:15.48]I wonder if I can jump that.
[448:21.16]Alright, easy, ease it, EASE!
[448:30.93]That's a... That's a sweep!
[448:33.79]It was a sweep!
[448:52.30]This is hell.
[448:53.98]Oh my fucking god.
[449:01.48]There goes all my healing.
[449:04.48]She's already, like, back up.
[449:06.40]It started out alright, and then... Which, uh... You know what I think I'm gonna do?
[449:25.31]I think I'm just gonna... Instead of healing, just die.
[449:28.33]And then use all the heals.
[449:34.41]She just blocked it.
[449:35.34]Really?
[449:49.95]Well, I mean, not heal at all.
[449:52.27]Go as long as I can and die.
[449:54.01]And then use my heals.
[450:04.39]She's just very unpredictable.
[450:16.77]Well, that didn't even work.
[450:42.05]Come on now.
[450:43.31]Don't do this to me.
[450:44.71]Breaking my rule.
[450:56.47]It's a sweep on the ground pretty much every time.
[451:09.40]Watch it!
[451:32.33]Don't let you recover!
[451:33.61]Okay, phase two.
[451:56.19]Let's just use him.
[452:02.55]I'm gonna see what it does.
[452:03.26]Oh, it just eliminates them all!
[452:19.51]Okay.
[452:22.97]Oh no, it doesn't.
[452:26.54]Why?
[452:27.22]What does that do?
[452:27.86]That's kind of... okay.
[452:37.30]Is that a sweep?
[452:38.13]I can't tell.
[452:40.29]Of course, this asshole.
[452:43.18]It's always a sweep on the ground, it seems.
[453:05.73]Dude, these little magical fucking orbs.
[453:35.58]Watch out for those magics!
[454:03.22]No!
[454:04.06]God damn it!
[454:06.58]Fuck that move!
[454:10.60]Oh, fuck that move.
[454:15.44]That move sucks such ass.
[454:19.63]Oh, fuck off.
[454:26.73]What a load of dog shit.
[454:35.75]Perfect fucking dodges with like, no iframes.
[454:38.73]Oh, fuck off.
[454:57.40]Eat shit!
[454:58.36]That's bullshit.
[455:20.98]Fucking what the fuck give me a fucking break No, I didn't throw my controller.
[455:26.80]I put it on the table slightly angrily
[455:48.45]I'm stuck on them.
[455:49.07]Alright.
[456:02.84]Bites controller in half.
[456:08.58]That was definitely the attempt to probably do it.
[456:11.05]Is it three phases?
[456:13.09]I wouldn't be surprised.
[456:13.91]You know what's funny about these games?
[456:19.97]Especially this game.
[456:20.73]Especially about Sekiro.
[456:22.59]I... You know, I probably could... It's probably easier to win the lottery than it is to beat these bosses.
[456:28.91]You know what I mean?
[456:38.35]I bet you if I... Okay, in the time it takes for me to beat this boss, I could probably buy, like, a scratch ticket every, like, 20 minutes.
[456:45.87]And, like, win 50 bucks.
[456:57.44]Alright, this is a dead run.
[457:04.93]Let me start over.
[457:23.83]Every death is an hour in Minecraft?
[457:27.69]You know what I really need to do?
[457:28.95]I really do need to get out of here.
[457:31.67]Because if anybody knows anything about muscle memory and playing games like this, you gotta have like 24 hours for your brain to even know what it's doing.
[457:41.98]See, I haven't like saved my game in my brain yet.
[457:45.20]Everything I've learned so far is not here until I go to sleep in Skyrim.
[458:07.16]No, it's a sweep!
[458:11.94]Hmm.
[458:21.99]Hmm.
[458:39.23]I have to get more, uh... No, I wasn't close enough.
[458:55.04]Are you almost at the health pool where I can actually hurt you?
[458:57.36]I thought it was another dash.
[459:13.94]I thought it was going to be a spin.
[459:21.26]I can't get out.
[459:21.78]I'm stuck.
[459:22.76]Oh my fucking god, guys.
[459:23.76]I can't move.
[459:24.97]I fell in my well.
[459:25.87]It's in my house.
[459:27.61]I don't know.
[459:28.29]Is somebody going to help me?
[459:30.71]Is this a rope?
[459:32.03]I fell all the way down.
[459:33.85]I pee into this fucking thing.
[459:36.03]Just throw the rope down here.
[459:37.20]I'll try to climb out.
[459:38.22]It's only like 60 feet.
[460:07.21]I'm gonna take a break.
[460:09.19]It's time to take a break.
[460:28.09]You know it's time.
[460:39.48]Get walled, stupid.
[460:58.56]Thanks for coming to stream, everybody.
[460:59.54]I'll see you tomorrow.
[461:09.11]There ain't no way I'm beating this shit tonight.
[461:19.58]This is so difficult for me to do right now.
[461:22.62]If you walked in here with gasoline, right?
[461:26.56]And you were like, Jeremy, you better hurry up and beat this or the whole house is going to burn.
[461:32.69]You can just walk around and like...
[461:52.04]I don't even know where I was going with that one.
[461:54.70]This is pure insanity.
[461:57.98]What I was trying to say was, in the time it took for somebody to, like, pour gasoline all over my house, give me ten warnings, and then start it in the corner, I'd still be here, like, in fucking an hour and a half.
[462:19.20]Not even that.
[462:19.74]You could just make like a small little like wood teepee downstairs.
[462:25.87]And sit there and blow on it while I'm up here screaming.
[462:29.54]You could steal everything in the house.
[462:52.84]This is actually the last time that I'm going to get out of here.
[463:07.21]Where did this person come from?
[463:10.09]I'm actually dying.
[463:12.50]This game, it gave it to me.
[463:13.88]It's killing me.
[463:26.89]Of course you block it, you dick.
[463:54.42]I tried to jump in every time!
[463:56.08]It's incorrect every time!
[464:21.77]Hello?
[464:22.41]Hello?
[464:39.38]Impressive, boy.
[464:41.92]Alright, I'm gonna run around and... Oh, hi.
[465:22.62]Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.
[465:50.96]Where'd it go?
[465:51.68]Where'd it go?
[465:52.35]Where is it?
[466:23.60]don't you dare do that to me I swear to god I will be very upset with you I'm losing my mind I'm man the second phase me
[467:13.49]No, don't, don't, don't!
[467:17.27]I tried to jump it!
[467:19.19]I tried!
[467:20.51]It just happened so quickly!
[467:34.96]That happened real fucking fast now, didn't it?
[468:29.69]It's so fucking hard.
[468:31.43]It is so hard.
[468:33.15]It's so hard.
[468:34.51]It's so hard.
[468:36.21]It's the hardest thing I've ever done.
[468:39.19]It's so hard.
[468:40.43]It's so hard, bro.
[468:41.95]Bro, let me tell you something, bro.
[468:43.29]It's so hard.
[468:53.07]Kill me.
[468:53.49]Kill me.
[468:53.78]Just do it.
[468:54.08]Kill me.
[468:54.32]It's over.
[469:00.50]It's that second phase, trying to get the damage to be able to do the posture damage.
[469:04.51]It just sucks.
[469:08.57]You gotta get behind them.
[469:09.85]You gotta dodge to the... The only way you can really do that is when they go in the air and you throw the thing.
[469:16.89]Wait, how long has this been on for?
[469:18.91]How long's that been on for?
[469:21.35]Did you not see that attempt?
[469:24.28]What is the last thing you saw?
[469:28.20]No fucking way.
[469:29.98]Okay.
[469:36.59]Okay, good.
[469:37.05]I was gonna say that was a really good attempt.
[469:39.47]Fuck.
[469:44.23]Oh, this game is so hard.
[469:46.69]It's like next level.
[469:48.59]Now I see what people were talking about.
[469:52.55]I was like, nah, it's not, like, what do you mean it's, like, the hardest game that they've ever made?
[469:56.75]Everybody says that.
[469:58.31]No, this is fucking brutal.
[470:01.81]It's fun, though, because it just fucking, it's something, I might have to restart again.
[470:40.58]That was a good exchange.
[471:09.01]You just fucking embarrassed me on my stream.
[471:12.05]The only person that embarrasses me on my stream is me.
[471:14.78]Impressive, boy.
[471:40.56]Come here, come here, come here.
[471:41.26]Group up, group up, group up.
[472:15.33]Not this time.
[472:16.96]Not this time, Elsa!
[472:56.83]Oh, and we can finally call it quits.
[473:04.55]Wait, I did it again.
[473:11.37]Fucking frozen shoe bitch.
[473:13.64]It's too high.
[473:19.72]It's too high.
[473:20.14]Please don't burn my house down with gasoline.
[473:33.48]That was really fun.
[473:41.79]Okay, Droplet.
[473:42.61]Pale pink crystal residue known to form when an immortal oath fails to establish.
[473:47.03]Okay.
[473:48.47]I'm going to talk about this for a second.
[473:50.67]Those of you guys that have seen the cinematic masterpiece and written down book masterpiece that is the Harry Potter universe.
[473:59.60]Okay.
[474:03.06]You know that scene when Dumbledore, the strongest character in the entire universe, right?
[474:09.81]He tells Harry he's going to drink that potion.
[474:13.83]And he's like, no, I can't do it.
[474:15.49]Please, no, please, no, no.
[474:17.18]He's the strongest guy in the whole world.
[474:20.24]And he says, make sure that I do the whole thing, right?
[474:27.30]It's really hard.
[474:28.83]And he tells her, like throughout the course of it, he's like, I'm not doing it.
[474:32.09]I'm not doing it.
[474:33.19]Get it away from me.
[474:34.55]But they do it.
[474:35.95]And then spoiler alert.
[474:43.58]I was going to say that something else, but.
[474:52.15]Point is, I was saying those things.
[474:54.25]I was going, no, I can't do it.
[474:55.83]I'm not going to do it.
[474:56.49]I'm done.
[474:57.05]I'm going home.
[475:00.33]But all I just had to drink the rest of the potion and now I'm fine.
[475:10.71]It's too much for me.
[475:11.37]No, it's too hard.
[475:11.87]I got to go.
[475:12.45]I'm leaving.
[475:16.11]How is that a bad analogy?
[475:17.35]Dumbledore drinks the potion and he says he can...
[475:34.70]You took your hands off the controller and this is what happens.
[475:49.93]Tied to cutscene wheel.
[475:53.63]Okay.
[476:12.42]I cannot throw away such loyalty.
[476:20.74]Loyal wolf, take my blood and live again.
[476:26.42]The potion actually, like, was... The potion was killing Dumbledore.
[476:38.46]Even in... No, he was fine.
[476:44.82]Look, I just missed a major, major storyline cutscene because somebody questioned my Dumbledore analogy.
[476:51.33]I'm furious right now.
[476:53.35]I am fucking furious.
[476:56.15]What just happened?
[477:05.73]Nothing?
[477:11.26]What is it?
[477:16.16]Here, put this in.
[477:18.49]Firecracker.
[477:24.37]Blinds, foes, and inflicts posture damage on beasts.
[477:27.27]Type 70s.
[477:28.03]I can't even... It's time to go.
[477:31.71]That is such a perfect opportunity for me to tell you that.
[477:34.11]I'll see you tomorrow.
[477:39.81]That wouldn't even words.
[477:41.97]that was just phonetically pronouncing sounds where I thought the spaces needed to be for the text that was on the screen alright so what do I what do you think about Sekiro where would you put it in the oh we're going to call it something different now the the Sekiro is born the secu the the souls the souls kiro born games
[478:21.37]I don't know.
[478:23.11]It's really hard to say.
[478:27.29]I do think it is probably... So first time playthrough I think is the hardest.
[478:35.93]I'm trying to remember Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 1, Bloodborne.
[478:39.97]I'm trying to remember the first 10 hours or so in the game.
[478:43.45]I think it's the hardest first 10 hours of any of the games.
[478:47.99]Now, who knows if that's going to keep being the case, whether or not, you know, when I have my save point when I wake up tomorrow, my muscle memory and all that.
[478:56.73]It's fantastic, though.
[479:00.41]It's everything and more.
[479:03.95]That snake was just 10 out of 10.
[479:11.20]It's great to get your ass kicked by a game that's really, really hard.
[479:17.22]But that's just exactly at 8 hours here.
[479:21.34]I'm not even going to move from this spot.
[479:32.53]Well, I am, but the character's not.
[479:36.71]So tomorrow, whenever I get up and get going, we're going to go again.
[479:42.14]I'm not going to play without.
[479:42.96]What are you talking about?
[479:45.58]When have I ever done a FromSoftware game on stream and didn't finish it?
[479:53.48]No, we... I'm gonna try to get through the whole thing.
[480:00.88]Dark Souls 2?
[480:01.66]I didn't... No, but Dark Souls 2 was... I already beat Dark Souls 2 twice before that stream even started.
[480:10.19]Demon's Souls?
[480:10.79]I beat all the Demon's Souls on stream.
[480:12.15]All Dark Souls 1, all Dark Souls 3.
[480:18.02]We have no evidence of that.
[480:19.56]I could show you Steam achievements.
[480:21.32]That would count.
[480:23.65]Long story short, I'm going to give this a yes out of alright.
[480:32.49]My final rating will have to come later.
[480:43.40]It's definitely two thumbs up.
[480:44.48]If you were on the fence, oh, I'm not so sure.
[480:46.50]They went in a different direction.
[480:47.56]It's great.
[480:50.48]If you like smashing your face against a wall over and over again, and eventually putting on both pants and tightening up your belt, and achieving great victory in a hard video game, absolutely.
[481:04.33]It's fantastic.
[481:08.49]So, uh, let's actually put on the outro screen.
[481:13.79]Hopefully by tomorrow this cough will be gone.
[481:15.33]Or at least diminished to a point where you won't even know it's happening.
[481:22.60]And we are going to go back to the bits.
[481:24.79]I am actually going to pee, though, first.
[481:26.89]Because it looks like we've got probably like about 30, 40 minutes of bits.
[481:31.09]Shouldn't take us too long.
[481:33.18]But I will be right back.
[481:34.32]Just going to pee.
[481:35.82]See you guys in a sec.
[483:36.11]I'm not muted.
[483:39.97]Oh, I thought I muted.
[483:41.73]He's passing stones.
[483:50.63]Well, I'm sorry about that.
[483:51.65]I usually am pretty good about muting.
[483:59.90]Anyhow, let's...
[484:08.18]You were all biked up.
[484:13.88]I enjoyed the ambient cars.
[484:17.83]Alright, so, thanks for coming.
[484:20.57]See you guys tomorrow, we're gonna keep going through it.
[484:23.73]And why don't we move on to... Bits.
[484:29.17]Don't miss the toilet.
[484:32.39]I don't miss the toilet.
[484:33.89]I do just fine, okay?
[484:37.17]So, let's go back eight hours ago, a long time ago.
[484:41.47]There was a lot of money tonight.
[484:42.97]A lot of it.
[484:45.12]Too much, one would say.
[484:46.98]There was $225, $250, one, twice, 50, 50, 50, a shitload.
[484:49.52]An absolute shitload of money.
[485:00.54]So let's go back.
[485:01.00]Sad Vega, thanks for the $2.50.
[485:02.28]I'm so mad right now.
[485:03.24]My Amazon pre-order just came in the mail.
[485:05.86]They mailed me my digital code.
[485:08.64]I had to wait all day for it.
[485:12.56]Wait, why would they mail you a digital code?
[485:18.44]Why wouldn't they just have it so you can just copy and paste or something?
[485:21.13]Yeah, that sucks.
[485:22.49]Well, you got it.
[485:24.33]Hopefully you enjoy it.
[485:25.77]It's a great game.
[485:31.03]some guy thanks for 15 bucks 15 from some guy wow holy crap an EU friendly stream oh sub only is still on right uh how do I turn that off sub only the room is already in sub only mode sub only off so how do I do the sub how do I turn off
[486:05.50]What's going on?
[486:07.04]Okay, my chat just crashed.
[486:09.28]Um... I actually don't know how to do this.
[486:16.17]I feel like... Oh, no, no, no.
[486:20.85]Hey, there... No, that's not how you do it.
[486:28.36]I don't know how to do this.
[486:33.58]Does anybody know what the command actually is?
[486:35.20]Because I have no idea.
[486:39.36]This just goes to show you how often this gets put on.
[486:42.36]I don't know how to take it off.
[486:51.45]Oh, I forgot.
[486:52.57]Even the mods don't even know.
[486:56.05]Nobody knows how to turn it off.
[487:03.47]Is it subscribers off?
[487:05.79]Does that turn off all my subscribers?
[487:13.30]Oh, there we go.
[487:13.84]Okay.
[487:16.18]Hey, welcome back, everybody.
[487:18.25]Hope you enjoyed the stream.
[487:19.37]Sorry you were muzzled.
[487:24.99]Thank you.
[487:26.84]But some guy, 15 bucks.
[487:28.96]EU-friendly stream.
[487:29.96]Sadly, I won't be watching this stream because I want to play the game myself.
[487:32.85]But anyway, he's a meme video.
[487:34.63]Only about five people in the chat will understand what this is.
[487:40.91]Um... Let's... Let me see.
[487:43.02]You get a life?
[487:55.57]This is a meme video?
[488:04.39]Oh, thanks.
[488:10.41]I just cut it off, like, even before the breakdown.
[488:16.72]Uh, it said, it was a warning on it.
[488:20.30]It was like, beef brain bath, like, warning.
[488:23.90]I'm afraid to link this.
[488:26.12]I don't know if that means, like, it's gonna be loud or something.
[488:34.63]I'm scared to link that.
[488:37.53]But, uh, yeah, if you're not gonna watch the Sekiro streams and you wanna enjoy it yourself, I completely, absolutely understand.
[488:46.05]These games are meant to be cherished and have your, you know, take your time through them.
[488:52.26]Enjoy it.
[488:53.98]It only happens once every few years.
[488:55.88]Enjoy it.
[489:00.00]But thank you for the $15 if you come across this.
[489:02.35]Thank you.
[489:05.03]Thank you, VenomousViolets, for the five bucks.
[489:07.09]Your stream is going to get me through my last two hours of work.
[489:09.87]Even thinking about skipping the gym to go home and watch the rest.
[489:14.14]I've held out on watching all other Sekiro streams to watch yours.
[489:17.42]Such a big fan of my very first bit donation.
[489:19.24]Here's to many more.
[489:19.92]Thank you.
[489:22.44]I hope you enjoyed it.
[489:24.53]I did.
[489:26.63]I thought it was a blast.
[489:29.95]In a... Continuously stab yourself with a... Small needle.
[489:40.70]Kind of fun.
[489:43.60]But... It's really great to play these games.
[489:47.56]I was gonna pass a kidney stone.
[489:55.89]Maybe.
[489:57.60]I'm gonna go take a bath after this one.
[490:01.30]But thank you, VenomousViolets, if you come across this.
[490:03.00]Thank you.
[490:03.34]Because these were a long time ago, so... I can understand if you're not here anymore.
[490:10.44]Uh, Multitrip, thanks for 250.
[490:11.96]Can't believe you're doing a sequel to the Nioh Meltdown stream.
[490:14.28]I'm very excited.
[490:15.89]Here's the difference.
[490:16.95]Uh, I got out of the first area.
[490:19.75]In Sekiro.
[490:21.07]I can't say the same thing for Nioh.
[490:28.18]the one and only time I played that I was drinking a bottle of whiskey it was such a bad idea so let's do it again tomorrow uh I'm gonna maybe I'll have a few drinks tomorrow yeah you know what I deserve it I deserve it you know I haven't had like I haven't had any drinks I deserve like two glasses of wine tomorrow I've been a good boy
[491:01.46]Yeah, I'm sick.
[491:02.22]Never mind.
[491:04.70]That's true.
[491:05.28]I do have a cough.
[491:06.18]Never mind.
[491:06.60]Damn it.
[491:12.20]Yeah.
[491:13.70]No, I gotta be a good boy again.
[491:16.88]Let's continue to be a good boy.
[491:18.53]I do want to get over this.
[491:19.73]It's really, really annoying.
[491:23.61]You can tell when you have that cough that you can just feel... It's almost like... People probably think I'm laughing.
[491:31.76]but half the time you've heard me go like has been my chest has been trying to escape my body alcohol is not gonna help probably a bad idea but thank you for the 250 multi-trip
[491:56.03]This is where the string started of... 50 bucks from Katsupini, 50 bucks from JunoEpsedo, 225 dollars from Dai335, 250 dollars from GuyDude, 50 dollars from TheReno, 50 dollars from Koopa Troopa.
[492:15.42]Holy shit.
[492:22.46]Earlier in this stream, it's... It was bunkers.
[492:34.05]It's insane.
[492:38.31]But thank you, Buttsniffer, or Buttsniffing.
[492:43.82]Thank you for the $25 from earlier.
[492:46.12]I'm just gonna pretend that you're a dog.
[492:51.30]Dogs do that.
[492:54.26]They say, Jeremiah, I've been watching you since I was like 12 when you played Borderlands on Lepter's channel.
[493:02.63]Oh man, that's a long time ago.
[493:06.51]2011.
[493:08.58]It's 2019.
[493:09.28]I'm 20 years old now and I figured I'd show my appreciation for all the content that's helped me through some tough times.
[493:18.34]From 12 to 20.
[493:24.51]Well, I am stunned that you've been around for that long.
[493:33.27]Your whole teens into your early 20s.
[493:40.01]I hope you listened to me when I said to like be a good, try to be a good person.
[493:43.58]Eat like vegetables.
[493:44.44]Eat, um, always, you know, pay bills.
[493:50.36]And I said a lot of things, right?
[493:56.48]Vegetables?
[493:57.44]Ew.
[494:02.73]Once 22, now 30.
[494:03.85]The Grim Reaper's biting my heels.
[494:07.77]I did something today that I haven't done ever.
[494:09.49]This is like, you know, potentially embarrassing, but who cares?
[494:14.84]I ordered a back brace.
[494:20.86]Because I want to wear it on stream.
[494:23.22]Because I want to keep my posture good and support my back.
[494:25.83]It's been killing me.
[494:34.83]So I'm trying ways to approach it, you know?
[494:40.80]The bottom, kind of middle, back, right, flanks of my back.
[494:44.56]It's been going on for six, seven months.
[494:46.46]I've had every...
[494:50.98]I've checked my kidneys.
[494:52.54]Everything's fine, apparently.
[494:56.56]I've had so many tests over the years to see, like, what the fuck could be wrong.
[495:02.16]No, I think it's just... I think I'm just getting old.
[495:12.48]I have no idea.
[495:13.10]I have a colonoscopy coming up.
[495:16.62]So maybe we'll see if something else weird is going on back there.
[495:22.46]I'm gonna start doing exercises, but yeah, I've got a back brace.
[495:27.94]I'm gonna be falling apart.
[495:28.88]I'm gonna lose all my hair.
[495:29.78]I'm gonna have a back brace on.
[495:31.06]I've got a damn cane.
[495:37.73]But, regardless.
[495:39.57]Thank you.
[495:41.01]Thank you, ESP, especially Root.
[495:46.01]Thank you, Root, for the 26 bucks.
[495:49.85]Jerma, say something funny.
[495:50.99]jermaVenus?
[495:55.90]Oh, like, I did say something funny, and then that was like a PogChamp.
[496:00.14]Oh, okay, I see.
[496:02.66]Well, thank you for the $26.
[496:03.20]That's a lot of money.
[496:09.04]And... Thanks.
[496:11.44]$26.
[496:11.75]Hopefully I'm... Hopefully what I said was funny.
[496:21.33]Ferodian Weapon, thanks for the $2.50, Ferodian.
[496:23.95]No message, just $2.50.
[496:25.21]Thank you.
[496:26.84]Dorkcube, thanks for the $2.50.
[496:29.94]Here's a free video title for Holy Mech.
[496:33.51]Sekiro, Jerma dies twice as crossed out many times.
[496:43.11]Or, I could be a really good YouTuber.
[496:46.00]And remember how I did that thing where I fell down the well?
[496:49.32]It'll be Sekiro Episode 1.
[496:53.07]I fell down a well in two or three exclamation points and like three question marks and there'll be a my mouth wide open like that like that hyper PogChamp right on the front and then like a picture of a well and
[497:15.43]The video game is so far in the background, it's my face blowing out almost all of it.
[497:19.85]A picture of a well, this is one sentence, or two sentences in an eight-hour stream.
[497:30.15]Please, somebody, God, click this video, is what that says.
[497:43.89]And you have giant saucer photoshop eyes.
[497:59.22]The internet.
[498:01.38]Are they gonna dig this shit up in a thousand years?
[498:04.20]And they're gonna be like, what's wrong with humans?
[498:11.89]Thank you HeyZeus for the $2.50.
[498:13.27]Be a part of Soil twice.
[498:14.45]Mm-hmm.
[498:17.83]Mm-hmm.
[498:21.99]It's true.
[498:23.85]Marvash Magali, thanks for the $2.50.
[498:25.15]Hi, Jerma.
[498:25.79]Just wanted to let you know that One Punch Man 2 is going to be out soon.
[498:28.64]Make sure to save your yearly anime token for that.
[498:32.74]No, I'm going to watch it.
[498:34.79]because in my opinion my yearly anime token currency that's okay that's a second season it's not one season per year it's one anime per year so that means one punch man season two is still part of the one anime a year because it's one it's just another season
[499:02.27]That's a loophole.
[499:03.01]No, it's the same.
[499:03.93]It's a loophole.
[499:05.67]That's the same show.
[499:07.21]Hey, Peaceful Haley, thanks for the $2.50.
[499:15.77]Hi, Jeremy, how are you doing?
[499:19.21]I'm doing pretty good.
[499:21.27]And they say, to be honest, these past couple days I've been feeling pretty unhappy.
[499:24.39]I don't want to share my sob story, though.
[499:26.95]I always feel happier watching your streams.
[499:29.67]I don't know, hard times right now.
[499:30.82]I'm just hoping it can get better.
[499:32.06]I hope it isn't a weird thing to say, but I wish I had a friend like you.
[499:35.58]You seem like a very understanding person.
[499:38.06]Anyways, have a good day.
[499:39.02]Hope you're enjoying Sekiro.
[499:42.48]I'm sorry that you're not feeling it.
[499:45.61]That doesn't... That makes me sad.
[499:47.75]That somebody... People that hang out here... That have supported the channel... Are potentially not doing good.
[499:56.68]Not doing alright.
[499:59.84]I really hope whatever you're going through, you get out of it.
[500:02.56]You push through it.
[500:10.08]I want everyone to be happy, you know?
[500:11.30]I want you to... I want you to be like... Enjoying yourself.
[500:14.31]Enjoying your life.
[500:18.90]I really, truly hope that you start- That- What the f- Did you hear that?
[500:26.86]That person just tried to cut me off.
[500:29.28]Did you- That was somebody trying to talk over me and cut me off.
[500:36.29]That was like a- How many cars do you have?
[500:44.87]How many people are in your, like, rumored cult?
[500:50.80]Are they self-multiplying?
[500:55.69]It's a single-cell Vroomer organism?
[501:03.31]They're like bees!
[501:05.13]They found a hive and they're just going to and fro.
[501:09.34]At least hope they're pollinating plants.
[501:18.30]But anyways...
[501:22.31]I'm enjoying Sekiro.
[501:27.16]I would implore you to... I know you're pretty active in this community already.
[501:35.02]But there are a lot of great people around here.
[501:37.08]Especially in that Discord.
[501:38.34]I know that you hang out there.
[501:39.18]A lot of like-minded people.
[501:46.83]Hopefully that, over the months and years, you can find somebody to hang out there.
[501:51.99]Somebody that can... chill with you.
[502:04.98]We should make it called.
[502:06.10]I don't think that's a good idea.
[502:09.68]That's a very bad idea.
[502:13.60]But take care of yourself.
[502:15.64]I wish you the best.
[502:16.28]Thank you so much for the $2.50.
[502:21.00]Like-minded indeed, we all eat an equal amount of glue.
[502:24.78]No, I eat way more.
[502:29.10]I eat the most.
[502:32.79]Smellyboy, thanks for the 250.
[502:34.09]How would you feel if you found out that death consisted entirely of an eternity where the only thing you can perceive is Jerma Defoe in front of you?
[502:42.99]You cannot hear, smell, feel, or taste anything.
[502:45.33]Just stare at Jerma Defoe eternally with no perception of anything else.
[502:52.80]I don't think it matters what image it is.
[502:54.42]Any image would be terrible.
[502:57.82]It could be a puppy.
[503:01.24]And after 200 Malenia, you'd be like, get this fucking dog out of my face.
[503:05.92]It would start to morph.
[503:09.46]You ever look in a mirror for long enough at yourself?
[503:12.74]If you just stare at yourself in a mirror for five minutes, your eyes and your teeth start to morph.
[503:18.97]Imagine looking at yourself in a mirror for 60 years straight, 1,000 years straight.
[503:26.23]Don't ever do that during a dream, though.
[503:35.35]Are you high?
[503:37.47]No, just sick.
[503:46.47]Honey chain, thanks for the three bucks.
[503:47.74]Hey, Jerma, just want to send you some love your way.
[503:49.54]Thank you.
[503:50.96]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[503:56.74]We have said, SuperSeal250, I can see why you wouldn't want to, but don't be afraid to turn on sub-only mode more often.
[504:02.56]I like how chill it is more than the others.
[504:07.39]Yeah.
[504:12.93]It works sometimes.
[504:16.57]But I like having chat go crazy sometimes.
[504:19.37]I like having chat react instantly and be able to look over there and see something instantly from everybody, right?
[504:32.19]Sub-only mode all the time is, it's like paying to chat, right?
[504:39.41]And sometimes when there is, I guess, more than two, three, four, five thousand people who are chatting at the same time, it can be necessary.
[504:49.13]Especially if stuff doesn't get out of hand or there's a big argument or a bunch of spam or something, it's a good way to kind of calm it down.
[505:04.53]Yeah, the low delay is amazing.
[505:05.72]Remember how it was before?
[505:09.26]Something would happen, and I would look over to the chat, and it would take 10 to 15 seconds for me to see anything there.
[505:22.48]How did we manage before?
[505:23.92]I don't even know.
[505:29.49]But there's a time and place for it, like we said.
[505:31.59]Talked about it already.
[505:34.28]Maybe it'll stay on for Sekiro.
[505:37.82]Maybe after another six hours or so.
[505:40.16]Maybe I won't need it anymore.
[505:41.74]We'll see.
[505:43.54]It's not something I do all the time.
[505:48.72]Hey, Spareth!
[505:49.40]Thanks for the $5, Spareth.
[505:52.56]Hey, Jeremy, just wanted to let you know that your birthday shout-out into a video for my friend...
[505:57.87]I put your birthday shoutout into a video for my friend, and it went over super well.
[506:02.55]You definitely went harder than $20 deserves, so I figured I'd share some extra love.
[506:06.79]Treat yourself to an ice cream cone.
[506:08.57]Any flavor you want.
[506:10.13]Alright.
[506:11.47]Feel better?
[506:12.55]Pinwheel was a punkass.
[506:13.89]Take it easy.
[506:16.66]Glad that it went well.
[506:17.60]Glad that it made them happy.
[506:22.18]Thank you for the five extra dollars on top of the $20 that you already gave.
[506:26.64]Appreciate it, Spirit.
[506:35.66]Uh, nor, thank you, nor, thank you, nor binary for the $10.
[506:40.88]And there's another, hot take alert, just get five community subs right now.
[506:49.26]Thank you.
[506:53.65]Thank you, hot take alert.
[506:55.39]Really appreciate it.
[506:59.05]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[507:02.23]But NorBinary, thanks for the $10.
[507:04.86]Jeremy, gonna join in on the bits feels.
[507:06.56]Just wanna say that after watching you from near beginning of your YouTube days, you've grown a lot, but kept being the same genuine guy.
[507:13.88]You've also reached your goal.
[507:15.10]You've kept being funny, evolving your content throughout the years.
[507:17.98]Appreciate you, dude.
[507:19.60]For all you've done and shared throughout having mental instabilities, and that's just inspiring.
[507:24.51]Hope to be able to do such greatness as you've done with my shit.
[507:29.11]Now get that, Sekiro.
[507:37.42]Thank you.
[507:41.82]There's already been a couple of bits tonight talking about how long they've been around this community.
[507:50.49]And that's... that's a long time.
[507:52.23]Remember, like, Friends was seven years.
[508:01.70]How long was, like, Seinfeld?
[508:03.20]Now I'm not comparing, I'm just saying, like, in a television sense, right?
[508:07.65]Like 10 years potentially of media.
[508:15.11]That's a very, very long time to still be in the community and still be around and still be sending me $10.
[508:25.12]This far down the road from the beginning.
[508:32.82]I am forever grateful and I'm shocked sometimes too.
[508:40.36]Thank you for the 10 bucks and for the continued monumental support.
[508:55.54]Tony said, Jerma, talk on the subreddit as Nintendo's killing your Twitch channel, suing you into oblivion.
[508:59.66]Hope this is fake.
[509:00.78]Is it one of my new favorite streamers?
[509:02.12]Hope the lawsuit goes well.
[509:03.40]Maybe set up a Patreon.
[509:04.62]What?
[509:05.54]Where is this coming from?
[509:06.64]I need to see where this is coming from.
[509:08.42]This is like the third time I've seen this.
[509:32.01]Where's this whole thing about me being sued?
[509:34.05]Oh, people are just making this up.
[509:53.15]Don't tell me to talk on the subreddit as you're getting sued.
[509:55.71]I don't even know this information.
[509:57.83]That's like... Why would I ever get sued by Nintendo?
[510:01.65]Have I even played a Nintendo game on stream?
[510:04.03]Uh, thank you, Cremator, for the five dollars.
[510:17.00]Gerwa, my sister found my Twitch password and disabled my account.
[510:26.74]that way that's what the two is there for cardboard infringement something similar to this another 250 from creator something better than Discord I don't know what that is a a memo
[510:52.17]I'm not going to have anything else besides Discord.
[510:54.49]It's already hard to manage that.
[510:57.43]Because there's a lot of people on that Discord and I'd rather have that just be the place.
[511:02.15]Amino is in another chat community.
[511:07.86]No, no, no, no.
[511:10.88]No, it's all centrally located on that Discord.
[511:13.12]I'm not spreading myself out over three, four, five social media platforms.
[511:20.44]Three, two, three, four, five different community apps.
[511:22.50]Uh-uh.
[511:23.20]Discord's the only one.
[511:27.00]I barely tweet.
[511:30.90]But, uh, thank you Yoshi Master for the five bucks.
[511:33.59]Every time you die and don't resurrect, I'm flipping three coins.
[511:36.77]If all are tales, I die of dragon rot and close the stream for the night.
[511:40.53]This is scary.
[511:41.33]Functional Nightmare.
[511:48.75]No, Discord's just fine.
[511:53.35]I pop in there a few times a week and just talk, give announcements, talk about things.
[512:02.75]I'm not going to make another... No, I'm not downloading Origin, you know.
[512:13.36]But thank you to Dorkube for the $2.50, Jervis Mad, Part Benny Hill.
[512:19.36]That's definitely... Somebody said that I was at my most, like, salty and savage tonight.
[512:26.53]Is that true?
[512:32.93]I don't think so.
[512:38.24]Not even close.
[512:42.30]It'll never be as bad as Hotline Miami 2.
[512:43.96]Hotline Miami 2.
[512:44.58]Ah, yeah.
[512:52.15]Creamator says, will you go on Google Plus before it shuts down?
[512:54.57]It's gonna shut down in a couple weeks.
[512:56.68]No.
[512:59.64]Why would I ever open Google Plus?
[513:03.02]Good riddance to that platform.
[513:15.63]Google Plus is the toy equivalent of a free race car in a cereal box.
[513:25.88]It was... It was... Why?
[513:27.74]No.
[513:32.98]There's a ton of already great race cars already.
[513:35.50]Some of them even are free.
[513:41.79]But.
[513:45.39]Thank you, DoorCube.
[513:48.31]We also had FluffyTuffy gave $10.
[513:49.81]He's asking if I'm going to play the Half-Life 2 beta.
[513:57.72]No.
[513:59.30]No Half-Life.
[514:00.94]Never.
[514:01.96]Guaranteed.
[514:04.06]But thank you.
[514:05.64]Appreciate it.
[514:34.07]Anyways, thank you.
[514:36.01]Thank you, Dork Cube, for the 250.
[514:37.45]Pro Chip, when you're so sick you can't reach the bathroom, just shit all over the floor, and Dream Jerma will pick it up with his bare hands.
[514:49.98]There's so many layers to what you just said that... I can't even explain what you said.
[515:00.23]That's like a 25-minute explanation to people that weren't here.
[515:13.92]But thank you.
[515:14.53]Thank you, Freudian Weapon, for the five bucks.
[515:23.13]Explain it, please.
[515:24.57]No, I had a dream where I had to walk around and pick up shit with my bare hands because there were people coming over.
[515:31.35]That's pretty much it.
[515:42.27]That's essentially the entire story.
[515:49.95]We also had Garfield the Monday Killer 250.
[515:51.86]Here comes Garflock with a new Garfograph.
[515:54.69]You get in that Pokémon Sword and Shield game, Geronimo.
[515:58.33]I know you don't give a hoot about Pokémon, but I always wanted to see a Jerma Pokémon team.
[516:03.01]You don't care about competitive stuff, so I'd make for a fun team rather than the best team.
[516:07.69]Lots of Pokémon playthroughs have teams that look too similar, but Jerm would do us right.
[516:11.88]It'd also give us a lot of new Jerma Rumble characters that'd be more interesting than you think.
[516:16.78]It'd be more interesting than you playing Garfield's cart.
[516:20.68]Well, I'll tell you.
[516:21.42]I'll tell you the team already.
[516:23.87]It's, uh... The... Hypno... Hypno... Whatever his name is.
[516:29.93]Hypnotop.
[516:32.39]Um... Who's the... What's the Dirty Rock?
[516:38.86]The Dirty Rock guy.
[516:44.50]Geodude.
[516:45.14]Okay.
[516:46.32]So... Hypnotop.
[516:48.22]Geodude.
[516:49.87]And...
[516:52.75]What's the weird, like, little mole bird?
[516:56.63]That comes out of the ground?
[517:02.69]This is like the little... Yeah, a Diglett.
[517:06.53]Yeah.
[517:08.25]That's the team.
[517:15.68]A mole bird.
[517:16.60]It's like a little mole.
[517:17.40]A little gopher.
[517:19.16]But it's got a bird face.
[517:22.24]you go this is the dream team hey tingy thanks to the 250 for every death and secure you have to buy one lottery scratcher and dedicate an entire stream to scratching them okay I'm serious okay that sounds fun sure was there a death counter tonight
[517:51.27]And then, and then, and then, whatever is won on the lottery tickets, whatever's won on the scratch tickets, right?
[518:02.07]Whatever it is, that goes back into community subs.
[518:11.30]I'm into that, that sounds fun.
[518:12.34]It's gonna be zero.
[518:23.13]Is gambling on stream terms of service?
[518:25.09]I don't know.
[518:25.97]I don't know.
[518:27.09]I don't think so.
[518:29.16]If it's legal, right?
[518:32.06]Don't people play, like, blackjack on Twitch?
[518:37.04]Can I, like, scratch, like, 45 scratch tickets?
[518:41.87]Gambling is a category, right?
[518:43.77]Guys, I live in Las Vegas.
[518:45.19]It's definitely legal here.
[518:56.71]Me streaming doing scratch-offs.
[519:01.09]And look, if you want me to be completely and totally like, oh, you don't like the gambling thing.
[519:06.20]You don't want to make it look like fun.
[519:07.70]No, no, no.
[519:07.94]I'm going to write on the screen, like, do not fucking ever buy these.
[519:12.22]I'm going to write the word mistake 12 times.
[519:14.44]It's going to be around the screen while we do it.
[519:24.23]I think that'll be fine.
[519:25.01]I'll double check to make sure that would be, like, okay with Twitch.
[519:30.73]So, yeah.
[519:34.29]We'll see.
[519:34.87]Should it be, for every death, should it be a dollar or, like, five dollars?
[519:38.36]Because one dollar scratch-offs don't win shit.
[519:43.60]They have the worst probability.
[519:47.32]Five dollars is a pretty good medium, I think.
[519:50.28]That's gonna be expensive though, I have to be careful.
[519:53.10]If I die a hundred times... I'm gonna die like 125 to 150 times.
[520:00.88]I died like 10 times just to the butterfly lady.
[520:18.56]We're at 15.
[520:19.20]I think it's more than 15 deaths today.
[520:21.63]At least 10 of them.
[520:23.73]Only 10 were in the last 40 minutes.
[520:26.25]You're telling me I only died 5 times over the course of that first 7 hours?
[520:30.77]No way.
[520:31.25]I probably died at least 5 to 6 to 10 more times.
[520:39.96]Probably like 25.
[520:40.60]Yeah.
[520:41.44]Yeah.
[520:46.93]Yeah, not resurrects.
[520:47.87]We're going true deaths.
[520:49.77]Actual, you get the ending, not resurrect, game over.
[520:56.76]We'll see how it turns out.
[520:57.64]That's a fun idea, though.
[521:01.30]Thank you, Tingy.
[521:02.76]That was a great idea.
[521:11.25]It might have to be $1 scratch tickets.
[521:15.13]Because if I die more than 100 times...
[521:18.60]Fuck it, whatever.
[521:19.22]You know what I mean?
[521:20.60]That would be fun.
[521:23.84]Let me do a little bit of research on that.
[521:25.50]But thank you.
[521:26.06]JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[521:27.66]He didn't, but thanks to 250.
[521:28.88]I know you have the black lung, but yell into your mic as loud as you can and I'll gift 20 subs.
[521:37.84]No.
[521:39.73]No.
[521:40.25]I'm sorry.
[521:40.65]I'm not doing that.
[521:42.89]Thanks to the 250.
[521:47.27]cough as loud as you can into the mic.
[521:48.71]Thank you, Freudium Weapon, for the $2.50.
[521:49.99]Appreciate it, Freudium.
[521:54.86]Pika Banana, thanks for the $5.
[521:56.16]How come you're streaming when you're all coughing and sick?
[522:00.34]Take care of yourself.
[522:01.08]Hope you feel better soon.
[522:01.86]Thanks for the fun stream.
[522:05.12]Thanks for being here.
[522:05.78]And why am I streaming today?
[522:07.76]Because it's Sekiro launch day.
[522:11.80]I'm not going to put a thermometer in my mouth and put the coverage up.
[522:16.99]No, no, no, no, no.
[522:18.33]I'm sorry.
[522:19.25]I can't stream today.
[522:21.67]It's only the launch of one of the most anticipated video games in the last half decade.
[522:33.26]No, I'm playing on launch day.
[522:34.50]I wanna play.
[522:35.48]I wanted to play, and I'm not gonna play off stream, you know what I mean?
[522:48.05]Oh, fuck.
[522:50.11]I haven't been catching these with the mute, I'm sorry.
[522:52.41]I know, it's so grating.
[522:54.31]I know people hate coughing.
[522:57.05]I tried to do it as best as I could today.
[523:06.21]But I feel okay.
[523:08.67]I don't have a headache.
[523:11.09]I don't have a stomach ache.
[523:13.61]I'm a little sluggish, but I'm not tired.
[523:16.99]You know what I'm saying?
[523:18.98]I feel fine.
[523:20.18]I just have a cough and a little irritation in my throat.
[523:23.44]That's it.
[523:27.16]And hopefully it's been for the last few days.
[523:28.98]I have to assume that it's going to be coming across the... going down the roller coaster here.
[523:47.88]It makes you feel like Spider-Man.
[523:56.73]We had to leave the room this morning.
[523:58.17]I was coughing.
[523:58.73]Yeah, we both have... Kim and I have just been on a seesaw.
[524:04.59]A cough seesaw.
[524:08.40]We're sleeping in the same bed.
[524:11.96]One person will cough really loud and wake the other person up.
[524:16.28]And then that person will fall back asleep.
[524:18.72]And then the person that woke up, then 30 to 40 seconds later, coughs really loud and wakes the other person up.
[524:25.91]And you go back and forth, getting awful dogshit sleep while you cough-wake each other up over and over again.
[524:37.87]And this morning, I just kind of got up and I was like, I gotta... I...
[524:44.92]And I want to take some medicine too.
[524:52.10]Is Kim your mom?
[524:55.79]Did you just hear when I said I share a bed with Kim?
[525:02.99]Reflect that statement for a second.
[525:12.87]I have a nightmare and I have to go sleep with my mommy's bed.
[525:25.35]She's your caretaker.
[525:27.92]She's my girlfriend.
[525:29.14]It's my girlfriend.
[525:31.94]Okay?
[525:41.21]But thank you, Freudian.
[525:42.05]Thank you, Pika.
[525:43.11]Banana for the five bucks.
[525:49.39]Thank you, Halo, for the $2.50.
[525:51.84]$2.50.
[525:53.08]Thank you for the stream.
[525:56.12]It was fantastic to watch and enjoy.
[525:57.50]Hope you feel better soon.
[525:58.26]The ending was amazing.
[525:59.12]Thank you.
[526:05.80]Oh, hi, Kiwo.
[526:08.99]I didn't even notice you there.
[526:12.32]Hey, Kiwo and I are now Discord friends, don't you guys know?
[526:18.89]We're now- we finally made Discord friends.
[526:34.35]Kiwo's RP character got murdered today.
[526:38.11]Oh.
[526:40.21]What?
[526:41.03]No!
[526:44.90]murdered she's dead now that's terrible she's dead Jerma dead dead this is dead dead first person that knows what that is gets nothing but I will clap once
[527:19.54]Nope.
[527:26.23]This is dead.
[527:27.57]Dead.
[527:28.09]Got it.
[527:29.12]Seal boots.
[527:29.64]Nice work.
[527:34.30]Got it.
[527:34.80]Only person to get it.
[527:45.66]It was Venom, yeah.
[527:46.58]From the movie Venom.
[527:48.48]Now, if you haven't seen Venom, you're gonna watch Venom and you're gonna hear that and go, Oh, shit!
[527:55.50]That could've been me.
[528:01.61]I'm not going to watch it.
[528:03.01]Yes, you are.
[528:05.83]I know you're gonna watch it.
[528:08.47]You're gonna be sitting there, you're gonna eat a tub of ice cream one day.
[528:10.97]And it's gonna be hard for you to get up off the couch.
[528:16.07]You're gonna have your PS4 remote in your hands, and you're gonna be on Hulu or Netflix or something.
[528:21.89]It's gonna be right there.
[528:24.17]And you're gonna just- Ah, no!
[528:26.79]But you can't get up.
[528:32.56]And you're gonna press X over Venom.
[528:37.36]I'm gonna go- But you guys don't do that?
[528:42.96]What do you mean, rude?
[528:45.73]How many people don't eat like three McChickens or eat like a shitload of ice cream on the couch and then they can't move and you just watch like TV for four hours?
[528:55.50]Nobody else does that.
[529:03.49]Nobody in this chat has eaten three to four McChickens in a row.
[529:11.47]And watched TV for four hours.
[529:14.75]No.
[529:16.16]That was literally me tonight.
[529:17.60]See?
[529:18.76]Somebody gets it.
[529:23.52]Why McChickens?
[529:24.36]Because it's... I don't know.
[529:25.69]It's just kind of what you do.
[529:31.63]You never had a McChicken before?
[529:34.87]McDonald's gets a lot of shit.
[529:37.83]It's not... It's not very nice.
[529:42.51]McDonald's!
[529:43.25]Oh, gross!
[529:48.11]Where'd that chicken come from?
[529:50.58]It's this pink slime and they've been murdering you.
[529:55.82]Come on.
[530:01.10]What's wrong with McDonald's?
[530:08.03]You're the one who was shitting on McDonald's.
[530:10.95]Well, we call that a hypocrite is what that's called.
[530:26.62]I made air fried chicken for dinner.
[530:28.33]It's good shit.
[530:28.99]No, but I get that.
[530:30.03]Oh, that sounds actually really great.
[530:32.41]I want an air fryer.
[530:34.15]Are they worth it?
[530:35.83]Josh, is an air fryer worth it?
[530:37.39]Do you have an air fryer?
[530:42.73]I'm getting one.
[530:43.70]I'm ordering one tonight.
[530:46.24]Was it air fryer?
[530:47.66]Look it up.
[530:51.92]But look, fast food gets a lot of bad rap, but sometimes you just want to
[530:56.98]Just drive down the street, and just pull up, hit the brakes, and get a bag of gross food, and you sit down and you eat it, and you're like, alright, that was great, just don't do it every day.
[531:07.06]Do it like once every couple weeks or something, and just enjoy it.
[531:10.81]It's not gonna kill you.
[531:13.09]You eating four cheesy gordita crunches, it's very bad for you.
[531:18.25]But it's not, if you do that like once a month, or once every couple months,
[531:27.59]Four is too much.
[531:28.27]Two.
[531:31.69]I don't have... That's... There's no problem there.
[531:35.20]Just eat In-N-Out.
[531:37.14]No.
[531:39.78]In-N-Out is, I would say, at least two or three rungs down the list behind Shake Shack.
[531:46.89]That's just... I'm sorry.
[531:47.95]I'm speaking with factual data.
[531:59.22]In-N-Out's still good.
[532:02.40]But I would... If I could get a Shake Shack burger, I would get it over In-N-Out every time.
[532:12.14]Shake Shack's not as good as Five Guys.
[532:21.47]No, I think it is.
[532:25.01]I still think it is.
[532:33.01]I still think it is.
[532:34.33]I've eaten Five Guys a lot.
[532:36.03]I've had it a bunch of times.
[532:49.20]You're on the West Coast now.
[532:50.36]Oh, yeah.
[532:51.88]I'm in Las Vegas.
[532:54.27]This In-N-Out's fucking everywhere out on the West Coast here.
[532:57.27]I've had it since being here.
[533:01.17]It's just like, it's alright.
[533:03.01]I don't know.
[533:03.99]I... This is worse than saying.
[533:11.39]I'm going to say this and people are going to be really mad.
[533:14.73]This is like saying Witcher 3 is not game of the year.
[533:17.81]What am I about to say?
[533:19.69]And that's, in and out, tastes the same to me as a Wendy's Dave single.
[533:34.10]I would kind of just rather go to Wendy's.
[533:43.26]Because at least at Wendy's, I can get their spicy chicken nugget.
[533:50.91]Get the fuck off my coast, reee.
[533:55.07]I'm not on a coast, actually.
[533:56.63]I'm landlocked.
[533:59.12]I'm landlocked, baby.
[534:01.04]No coast here.
[534:01.88]Here.
[534:09.44]I officially hate Jerma.
[534:14.76]But In-N-Out's good.
[534:15.64]Look, if we all liked the same things, but I told you the Squidward argument already.
[534:22.57]You want to eat canned bread, and everybody loves the same place, everybody eats the same food, everybody... No, I don't want to live in the Squidward town.
[534:37.01]What fast food mascot is the best?
[534:39.78]Definitely... definitely the king.
[534:43.00]Until they, like, killed him or something.
[534:44.62]They got rid of him.
[534:45.22]I don't know why.
[534:49.18]The Scary King commercials were great.
[534:51.20]Where he was just, like, staring at people and stuff.
[534:52.96]It was, like, just so odd.
[534:53.86]They still... they still have him?
[534:57.26]I haven't seen him in a commercial in a long time.
[535:01.34]Yeah, they killed him off in an episode.
[535:06.30]One of the commercials.
[535:08.00]In one of the commercials, he took like an arrow to the neck or something.
[535:10.49]It was crazy.
[535:11.23]It was wild.
[535:11.77]Do you guys remember that controversy?
[535:32.25]Ronald McDonald...
[535:34.13]I feel like they just buried all these fast food cereal characters.
[535:38.05]When was the last Ronald McDonald commercial?
[535:42.28]No, they don't do that anymore.
[535:44.44]Guys, every fast food commercial is just two cool, hip, young people.
[535:50.44]Oh, let me steal a fry!
[535:51.60]Mmm!
[535:52.30]Ooh, delish!
[535:56.86]There's no fucked up weird cartoon characters anymore.
[536:01.72]The Hamburglar doesn't get punched in the face.
[536:06.21]They tried, here you go, ready?
[536:08.71]Fast food commercials now are Chili's and Friday's commercials from 10 years ago.
[536:16.52]Look at all these people having like a great time.
[536:19.92]They're sitting around dining in at McDonald's.
[536:23.12]Look at, they're all smiling, clinking glasses, taking a big sip out of their drink.
[536:28.46]Nobody gives a fuck.
[536:32.47]No, bring us our weird, demented, twisted cartoon characters.
[536:40.81]They're all Switch commercials now.
[536:52.94]And frankly, I think it's bullshit.
[537:00.86]What psycho goes to Burger King to have a good time?
[537:07.64]I never noticed that they killed off a lot of the cartoon mascots till now.
[537:10.26]Yeah, they did.
[537:18.37]You can say what you want about KFC, but at least KFC still has the Colonel in these commercials.
[537:24.58]It's finger lickin' good!
[537:27.76]My $5 fill-up box is worth its weight in gold!
[537:31.81]They still do that.
[537:38.93]KFC sucks.
[537:40.41]No, it doesn't.
[537:42.79]Well, I'll level with you here.
[537:45.67]Every other KFC sucks.
[537:47.97]Because sometimes you go to KFC and get a five-star quality, crispy, delicious, perfect meal.
[537:54.79]And then you go to the one down the street, and it's like a lunch lady put pig slop on your plate.
[538:02.52]There is no in-between.
[538:04.14]KFC is either terrible, terrible zero out of five.
[538:09.08]Or perfect.
[538:12.60]If they were more consistent, I would eat there more often.
[538:15.67]But they're just not.
[538:23.07]Popeye's is a lot better.
[538:24.07]I've actually never had Popeye's.
[538:25.21]I gotta change that.
[538:28.30]Yeah, I've never had it.
[538:35.20]Do they have Popeye's in Vegas?
[538:42.59]I don't know.
[538:43.99]I think so.
[538:46.65]Order it right now.
[538:53.89]It's based off of the popular cartoon character of the same name.
[538:58.46]Well, wouldn't they serve spinach there?
[539:03.46]Popeye didn't eat chicken.
[539:04.48]He ate spinach.
[539:11.81]It wasn't like... Biting into like a big crispy chicken leg.
[539:17.39]No, he squeezed the... He squeezed the can as hard as he could and it shot out of the top.
[539:25.61]That marketing worked, by the way.
[539:27.19]I used to want to eat spinach so bad because it looked so good when he ate it.
[539:33.56]I didn't eat vegetables.
[539:34.78]I hated them.
[539:36.52]It was very difficult for my parents to give me food that wasn't Captain Crunch.
[539:40.90]Or, like, mac and cheese and a hot dog.
[539:43.50]But holy shit, that, like, propaganda campaign that they ran for spinach worked on me.
[539:52.27]Bugs Bunny eating carrots.
[539:53.49]It worked.
[539:54.09]I wanted carrots, too.
[539:59.34]Am I going to go to PAX East?
[540:00.32]I am not.
[540:02.48]I am currently not in the area.
[540:06.48]I am on the Westland walk now.
[540:15.21]Am I going to go to Evo?
[540:16.23]Probably.
[540:17.49]I think so.
[540:22.71]Evo seems really cool.
[540:31.30]Am I gonna go to Anime Expo?
[540:33.08]No, I don't think so.
[540:39.79]Well, I didn't lie about Minecraft VR, I just didn't do an action in Minecraft VR that you wanted me to do.
[540:57.32]I didn't lie.
[540:58.86]I did the thing.
[541:01.46]By the way, here are tonight's subs and resubs.
[541:04.30]Thanks, everybody.
[541:04.82]A lot of community subs.
[541:08.98]Now I want KFC.
[541:10.88]I'm really booked.
[541:14.28]Am I really gonna go fucking flip a coin right now?
[541:18.73]Because I'll tell you, if I don't like it, and I think it's gross, and it's a 0 out of 10 experience, like it could be 50% of the time, I'm gonna be really upset.
[541:28.00]Let me look and see if there's a Popeye's.
[541:30.50]That sounds pretty good.
[541:31.64]Let me see if there's one.
[541:35.02]They have Popeye's in Vegas.
[541:36.78]Oh, damn.
[541:37.32]Okay.
[541:43.64]The KFC fries suck.
[541:45.43]Um, hold on.
[541:46.19]Kiwo, have you ever gone ever again?
[541:47.83]That might be a 50 percentile case there.
[541:52.59]Did you go twice?
[541:53.39]Okay.
[541:55.77]Alright.
[541:56.25]Okay.
[542:01.18]But if you flip a coin, it still gets me heads twice.
[542:03.36]Yeah, the wedges are gross.
[542:08.27]Fuck, what wedges?
[542:09.29]I don't know, I don't get that.
[542:14.31]Who wants to eat potato wedges?
[542:16.69]No, I want fries.
[542:23.62]They're just so mealy, and the skin on the outside, it's just, it's like stuck on your front teeth.
[542:29.64]You know what?
[542:30.54]Here, I'm gonna ruin potato wedges for every single person here.
[542:33.34]Are you ready for this?
[542:34.88]No one's gonna eat one ever again.
[542:37.36]You know, the Reese's wrapper.
[542:40.94]Have you ever put the Reese's wrapper, the thing that's actually around the cup, in your mouth?
[542:47.83]If the answer is yes...
[542:50.11]That is the same texture, the same consistency, and the same mouthfeel as the skin on a potato wedge.
[543:02.97]I ruined it for you.
[543:03.65]Disgusting, right?
[543:04.31]You'll never eat it again.
[543:10.68]It's like greasy wrappers in your mouth.
[543:15.13]It's like eating the Reese cup.
[543:16.94]Imagine if the Reese cup was not chocolate and peanut butter.
[543:19.40]It was potato and a little crispy on the outside.
[543:22.48]You're just eating.
[543:24.00]You're eating.
[543:28.91]You know what I was about to say.
[543:32.61]Your taste buds suck.
[543:34.35]Well, that's funny because I had a taste bud test.
[543:37.83]You know, some people do like a DNA test to find out like, oh, what's, you know, where am I from?
[543:43.16]You know, like, no, I did a taste bud test.
[543:47.98]I have 214 trillion, that's with a T. For those of you, that's with a T, taste buds.
[543:58.87]And I have way more of a savory palette than I do of a sweet palette.
[544:05.35]I have like 2.8 billion on sweet and like 200 billion for savory.
[544:22.05]Weird taste, but okay.
[544:23.59]Weird flex.
[544:26.06]Yeah, I'll flex.
[544:26.76]I don't know.
[544:27.82]I don't know.
[544:29.10]Whatever.
[544:30.94]But hey, thank you, Bingo Sunshine, for the $5.
[544:32.98]Jerma, go on Doughboy Podcast.
[544:35.56]Mitch is a Boston boy.
[544:36.78]I don't know what that is.
[544:37.58]I don't know who that is.
[544:40.13]But Boston.
[544:41.65]Sounds cool.
[544:49.03]Boston's a great place.
[545:03.39]He uses all the taste buds to eat ass.
[545:05.35]I can't believe I read that.
[545:07.17]Oh my god, he read it?
[545:08.03]Wow.
[545:08.73]I can't believe I read that.
[545:13.11]Jesus.
[545:14.37]Christ.
[545:19.69]You guys.
[545:21.49]I was with you guys.
[545:29.44]All those taste buds you couldn't tell Cheez-Its from Cheez-Nips.
[545:31.90]I actually... That joke got so ruined.
[545:35.14]Because I really couldn't tell which was which.
[545:38.55]With my eyes closed.
[545:39.69]And I was so desperately trying.
[545:40.91]And I fucked it all up.
[545:41.93]That's okay.
[545:44.93]Oh, BWL.
[545:45.83]He read it.
[545:46.33]BWL.
[545:49.95]Alright, guys.
[545:50.53]That's it.
[545:51.19]That's my time.
[545:55.42]I'll see you tomorrow.
[545:56.10]More Sekiro.
[545:59.99]I'm gonna go try to track down some chicken.
[546:05.00]I thought you fucking up- fucking it up with scripted.
[546:07.22]No.
[546:09.10]Precisely one hour of bit reading.
[546:11.30]Yeah.
[546:14.99]I think it's more streamlined.
[546:18.85]Since the change it's been somewhere between like 30, like 40 plus minutes.
[546:24.35]Rather than, like, two to three hours.
[546:26.77]Sometimes, you know.
[546:27.33]Well, that's an over-exaggeration.
[546:29.25]It never took, like, three hours.
[546:32.54]But it's definitely taken about an hour off the time at the end, so.
[546:39.06]The last few streams have been about 30 minutes.
[546:42.80]Two hours has happened.
[546:43.76]Three hours, maybe it's only happened once.
[546:48.28]Yeah, it's only, like, 10.30 here in Vegas.
[546:50.32]I started really early.
[546:51.10]I started at, like, one o'clock, two o'clock, something.
[546:57.11]But, thank you for joining me.
[547:00.30]Sekiro is amazing.
[547:02.04]It's incredibly frustrating, but that's the nature of the beast.
[547:05.52]I'm having a blast with it.
[547:07.54]See you tomorrow for more.
[547:09.96]Take care, guys.
[547:10.44]See you soon.
