[00:10.09]More guys there?
[00:11.11]Yeah.
[00:11.97]Ready?
[00:12.43]Oh my god.
[00:14.59]Gimme crits, gimme crits, gimme crits, gimme crits.
[00:17.78]Alright, that guy's almost out.
[00:20.76]There we go.
[00:21.36]That guy's out.
[00:22.34]Think that might be it, right?
[00:24.22]Maybe.
[00:24.54]Just gotta get the artifact.
[00:25.86]Hopefully it's not like an Indiana Jones thing where you pick it up and we get murdered.
[00:28.82]Alright, weapons just right here.
[00:31.96]Collect the reward.
[00:34.00]Improves Lilith's explosive artifact.
[00:37.30]Nice.
[00:38.74]Oh, I love these.
[00:40.20]Oh, these are awesome.
[00:43.92]Get the ammo.
[00:44.62]Let me pick up this.
[00:46.30]The Raging Sweeper.
[00:47.42]Alright, whatever.
[00:48.66]I want to use my class mod.
[00:50.42]This thing makes me... Oh my god.
[00:52.80]I love how it's just instant silence.
[00:59.35]Ready?
[00:59.85]This thing makes me... Oh my god.
[01:02.33]Look at that.
[01:03.87]Aw, the other one was cooler.
[01:06.07]Oh.
[01:07.59]Oh well.
[01:11.31]Does it like replace it?
[01:12.83]Incendiary artifact?
[01:14.07]No, it just adds on to it.
[01:15.33]So this one, this artifact.
[01:19.27]What do I have for an artifact right now?
[01:22.00]I think yours does fire damage when you send out your blood wing.
[01:27.54]I think it makes my blood wing do more damage.
[01:32.00]Yeah, it'll say it right here.
[01:32.88]There we go.
[01:35.28]We have to turn in Skagzilla, so we might as well do that.
[01:39.52]It should be one more thing we can do, right?
[01:41.02]Before we can go back to, like, really go back to town.
[01:43.68]There's one more.
[01:44.34]There's the glitchy one.
[01:45.46]Talk to the guy.
[01:46.28]The road warriors.
[01:48.98]Don't we gotta kill, like, a bunch of those, like, slugs or something?
[01:51.61]Uh, I guess so.
[01:53.69]I don't know.
[01:53.97]I think that's one of the quests we can still do.
[01:56.81]I'm gonna sell this shotgun.
[01:58.21]I'm just... Guys, I'm giving up on the shotgun thing.
[02:00.65]Whatever.
[02:01.29]Let it go.
[02:01.71]Ha ha.
[02:06.46]you and me sully and send your artifact to me that six thousand just fifty thousand that's what I have let me see this I think it's time to start right to go I need to me is this and I need and there's no grenades here shall we
[02:35.22]Well, this is a really weird sniper rifle.
[02:40.26]The sniper rifle's zoom is incredibly odd.
[02:44.88]It's a green, like, predator face thing.
[02:47.44]It's like, you know, like the predator when it goes to his point of view?
[02:50.26]Yeah.
[02:50.70]It's like that.
[02:51.24]It's all green and technology looking.
[02:54.39]Alright, let's get out of here.
[02:59.91]I like how you think.
[03:04.42]Alright, so let's put on this last one here.
[03:08.32]I did.
[03:09.52]The Death Race Pandora?
[03:12.26]Well, that was effective.
[03:13.41]It doesn't say it's active?
[03:15.29]No, I put on the one where we talk to the Claptrap.
[03:18.67]Oh, okay.
[03:19.09]Where is that?
[03:19.43]It's Death Race Pandora.
[03:21.39]Death Race Pandora is apparently right in this area somewhere.
[03:24.39]I want to do the Claptrap one because I think that either gives us an SDU or more backpack space.
[03:30.09]Alright, let's do it.
[03:34.53]I can't wait till they add vehicles to Team Fortress.
[03:37.20]Yeah.
[03:39.48]Can you imagine how ridiculous that would be?
[03:43.02]That would be crazy.
[03:45.50]Well, apparently there's a game mode that they haven't started.
[03:48.72]They have to talk about, apparently.
[03:50.14]Remember there was a new raid mode or something they were going to do?
[03:53.50]I don't know.
[03:54.42]Yeah, they were talking about it.
[03:55.42]Wrong way, wrong way, wrong way.
[03:56.30]Oh, that's not it?
[03:56.80]Oh, okay.
[03:59.42]Oh, yeah, I'm supposed to be navigating.
[04:00.80]What am I doing?
[04:01.68]Yeah, let's take a left right up here.
[04:04.13]this off that's it aside more possible here looks like I think this could be something railway where do we have to talk to it's right here might have to get up on one of those answers or something deal with all we just got something that we shouldn't you're trying to get in the car
[04:35.43]Yeah, yeah, we gotta get in that car.
[04:36.93]Oh yeah, we should probably get in that car.
[04:39.42]Oh my god.
[04:40.06]Oh my god, it's bombed.
[04:41.10]Get in, get in, get in, get in.
[04:42.54]I died.
[04:43.42]Oh yeah, we should probably get multiple cars.
[04:46.44]Alright, good to know, good to know.
[04:50.29]How are we locked in here?
[04:52.90]I'm locked in here.
[04:54.34]Yeah, I might be able to get in, but I don't know.
[04:58.12]Yeah, no, no, no, don't go in.
[04:59.16]Don't go in.
[04:59.56]I'm respawning right now.
[05:03.50]It comes at a cost saving a Claptrap.
[05:06.72]Yeah, I know, jeez.
[05:08.30]Here, drive out.
[05:12.00]Oh, it's right here.
[05:12.74]Oh my god.
[05:13.52]Alright, just let me know.
[05:15.96]Oh, they're throwing grenades.
[05:16.80]They're throwing grenades.
[05:17.78]Let's go.
[05:20.99]Oh, my bad.
[05:23.87]We need to take out one car at a time.
[05:27.31]Oh wow.
[05:28.55]We gotta split up, we gotta split up.
[05:30.93]We're gonna like stand in the same area.
[05:35.67]Shit, shit, I got flipped.
[05:37.47]Oh, I'm dead.
[05:38.97]I'm just gonna respawn.
[05:41.89]Okay, yeah, we gotta get like on opposite sides of the map.
[05:44.30]Just because we were both just sitting there inhaling bombs.
[05:50.08]Ow, ow, ow, ow, shit, shit.
[05:54.60]We can fight Skagzilla, but this guy.
[05:57.64]These guys destroy us.
[06:01.34]I'm coming, man.
[06:05.52]Did you get the guy that was weak?
[06:08.85]Yeah.
[06:20.36]That's another one down.
[06:23.60]Nice.
[06:25.23]My car is kind of destroyed, but... Oh, I think we saved him.
[06:30.11]Oh, okay, it's like a boss car.
[06:31.91]Yeah, it's like a boss car we got to destroy.
[06:37.61]Oh, he's flipping me around.
[06:41.01]No, I'm just attacking this guy.
[06:44.86]Yeah, I'm going to respawn really quickly.
[06:46.48]I mean, it'll cost me, but whatever.
[06:48.28]It's going to cost us.
[06:50.12]Whatever, though.
[06:52.00]Or hopefully we get something.
[06:53.61]Bad Mel.
[06:54.39]Holy shit, that just cost me $3,000.
[06:55.93]Oh, man.
[06:56.99]We're going to lose all of our money, but you know what?
[07:00.93]Whatever, we'll get it all back.
[07:04.03]I think you know what it is?
[07:05.03]It's the more time you do it in a short period of time, the more money it is.
[07:11.96]That guy's almost half way.
[07:12.94]I'm gonna kill him right now.
[07:22.00]This is it.
[07:22.86]One more.
[07:24.10]Yes.
[07:24.92]Come on, come on, come on.
[07:25.82]Shoot the car.
[07:26.24]I'm gonna shoot the car.
[07:27.10]There we go.
[07:27.44]He's dead.
[07:29.56]Alright, here.
[07:29.90]Revive me.
[07:31.64]Another stupid car.
[07:34.08]Let's get rid of this guy first.
[07:41.31]although I almost got second when I'm not going to ideas that cost me too much god damn it and I think that enjoy the new you wasn't yet that did you happen from that home I think we have to go through here every day of your
[08:14.91]There we go, here's a Claptrap.
[08:20.17]I've received proof of Mad Mel's demise!
[08:22.71]Claptraps everywhere will rejoice!
[08:25.15]Please wait while I enable access to New Haven!
[08:28.72]Just shoot the guy.
[08:31.28]So I guess this is just to go to a new area?
[08:34.10]Yeah.
[08:34.88]I wish he gave us something.
[08:36.44]Maybe he does.
[08:37.80]Shops have new inventory!
[08:41.59]Oh, this guy was like, kill him.
[08:43.34]Kill him, he's dancing.
[08:44.62]Make him stop dancing.
[08:48.66]Alright, so I think that's it, right?
[08:51.76]Yeah, let's just go back to the base and, you know, turn those quests in that we have.
[08:55.91]You in?
[08:56.55]Yep.
[09:02.25]Actually, it wants us to go that way for this quest.
[09:06.41]It's still, like, blinking over there.
[09:08.70]Should we call it a day?
[09:10.34]What do you think, man?
[09:11.75]Yeah, I guess why not, yep.
[09:12.67]Do you have time?
[09:13.63]We'll turn these in and we'll call it.
[09:14.71]Alright.
[09:15.67]I'm sure we'll get a lot of experience from these too, so.
[09:25.01]Yeah.
[09:25.77]Alright, you want to go straight, yep, straight up.
[09:28.07]That's right here.
[09:33.95]Boink.
[09:34.21]Alright.
[09:41.00]I haven't done those.
[09:43.68]Here he is.
[09:44.22]What did we get?
[09:46.48]Experience.
[09:52.15]Quest, and then we got one more to turn in, I think.
[09:54.35]We gotta turn in the Skagzilla one, right?
[09:57.11]Yeah, where's that?
[10:00.71]Maybe we have to select it.
[10:02.77]Yeah, maybe it's somebody else.
[10:05.99]Holy shit, where is that?
[10:08.65]We gotta go, I guess, down further, huh?
[10:11.80]Yes, to the right.
[10:13.26]I'll spawn us a car.
[10:14.72]I got my own.
[10:15.58]Just take your own.
[10:16.82]I'm just going to run down there.
[10:17.74]Oh, I teleported into your gunner seat.
[10:19.70]Did you really?
[10:20.64]Yeah.
[10:23.18]It's right... Yeah, it's just right up here.
[10:28.30]Oh, the gunner seat can shoot so much faster.
[10:32.60]Alright, it's right here.
[10:34.73]To the right.
[10:41.58]Alright, what do we get?
[10:45.16]Skagzilla.
[10:47.93]You got a sniper rifle.
[10:49.25]Why didn't you go shoot yourself an elephant?
[10:52.37]Whitting's elephant gun.
[10:53.85]Oh my god.
[10:55.85]I'll definitely take you.
[10:57.29]You are unbelievable.
[10:58.74]Is it good?
[10:59.68]Yep.
[10:59.96]It's very good.
[11:02.46]Nice.
[11:02.90]I definitely take that.
[11:11.50]I had like 54,000.
[11:12.72]Oh, it is.
[11:14.56]Oh, man, this is... This is not a sniper rifle.
[11:19.64]This is a combat rifle, I think.
[11:22.38]Nice.
[11:23.50]No, it is.
[11:25.50]No, maybe not.
[11:28.07]Yeah, no, this is not a sniper rifle.
[11:29.89]This is a combat rifle.
[11:30.99]So I'm going to have to keep my sniper rifle on, and we'll equip that on that slot.
[11:41.59]So compared to these, the fire rate on everything is up, but hey.
[11:49.57]How much is this thing?
[11:50.31]I'm going to buy it.
[11:53.72]$21,000.
[11:54.78]I just spent $21,000 on a new shield.
[12:00.02]Let me see this bad boy.
[12:02.28]Holy shit.
[12:05.10]I want to go and try and shoot someone with this thing.
[12:09.99]Yeah, definitely use that.
[12:12.98]Oh, hello.
[12:16.98]Got some cash there.
[12:18.10]That's nice.
[12:20.40]Shall we?
[12:22.08]Yeah, let me just sell some things.
[12:23.80]No prob.
[12:25.96]Kind of want to find something to shoot, though.
[12:27.61]Alright.
[12:31.85]I love the depth of field in this game.
[12:34.05]Yeah, it's awesome.
[12:35.89]As you go down, you guys can see it.
[12:37.57]See?
[12:37.93]Yeah.
[12:43.57]It's better illustrated with this.
[12:46.15]Nope.
[12:48.82]Well.
[12:49.92]Alright, here I go.
[12:54.34]This thing seems like it's going to be really powerful.
[13:02.36]Level up soon, too.
[13:03.98]Alright, well, that's been that, guys.
[13:06.54]Hope you guys enjoyed.
[13:07.20]That was like four or five episodes, so don't hate on us if we made mistakes.
[13:11.65]You know, the usual.
[13:14.33]And we'll see you guys next time.
[13:16.42]Later, guys.
