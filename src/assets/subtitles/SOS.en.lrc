[ve:60.16.100]

[00:27.57]Good morning.
[00:28.56]Good morning.
[00:31.54]How are ya?
[00:35.88]How's the stomach?
[00:36.46]Stomach's okay.
[00:37.86]I'm doing alright.
[00:38.36]How are you guys doing?
[00:39.40]Hope you're doing well.
[00:39.99]You know, I just hope you guys are doing fucking swell.
[00:47.47]Sound a lot better?
[00:48.43]I feel a little bit better.
[00:50.27]Not by very much, by maybe like 3%.
[00:59.15]I'll give you one second.
[01:00.95]And I will make a tweet.
[01:04.12]And we're gonna play this fucking PUBG game that, like, it's a Battle Royale game.
[01:08.02]Can't wait to play it.
[01:10.82]Alright, see you in a minute.
[01:41.23]Alright, so, uh... Yeah, I saw this game just came out on Steam.
[01:46.71]It is... Well, let's wait.
[01:48.71]Before I pass my judgment... I'm gonna judge this game before we even play it.
[01:54.54]You understand?
[01:57.88]I'm gonna judge the shit out of this game.
[02:01.96]That's what we're doing.
[02:02.82]Tonight is a judge this game stream.
[02:04.78]We're gonna do a new thing on the channel here.
[02:07.67]on twitch.tv/Jerma985 it's called judge this with an exclamation point so what we do is before we play the game we talk a bunch of about it and we talk about how the game sucks before we you know we judge it immediately and then we see if our hypothetical situation came true new series coming out and we pick what's on steam judge this except not at all
[02:36.42]I don't know how long this is going to last.
[02:40.46]It could be, uh... This could be just a little bit of a shorter stream than usual.
[02:48.20]Who knows?
[02:51.59]No, I'm not playing Facade right now.
[02:55.05]Apparently you're supposed to roleplay in this game.
[02:57.15]We're here.
[02:57.67]We might as well just move it over.
[03:00.25]Here.
[03:00.51]Here it is.
[03:02.86]You make a character.
[03:05.03]Think of this like another Battlegrounds game.
[03:08.59]Because that's the current MOBA right now.
[03:10.11]Right?
[03:13.58]You know, you have a game that does very, very well.
[03:15.54]It gets really successful.
[03:17.58]And... Oh, cool.
[03:20.00]I'm company B. I'm gonna make one of those games, too.
[03:22.65]I'm company C. I'm gonna make one of those games.
[03:24.67]And then, like, two years, three years go by, and, like, company... Company, like, M makes one of these games, and they're way too late.
[03:33.81]And then they close their doors like Infinite Crisis.
[03:38.04]So, we're currently in the stage, uh, we're in like the hysteria stage of Battle Royale games, where every developer is like, I gotta make one of those!
[03:47.88]And here's another one.
[03:49.54]Uh, so the only reason why, uh, we're playing this is because, I don't know, I felt like it.
[03:56.53]That's it.
[03:57.09]That's literally it.
[03:58.17]And I can't connect, I tried to connect it with Twitch and it didn't do anything, so who gives a shit?
[04:02.03]Playing as DocSquiddo.
[04:06.72]Am I... No, nobody paid me to fucking play this.
[04:09.96]I didn't get paid money to play this fucking stupid game.
[04:13.34]Look, judge this, okay?
[04:15.18]We're already doing that.
[04:19.97]Why is he so dumb looking?
[04:21.25]Because this is like the dumbest character I could find.
[04:23.71]And for instance, by the way, you can do stuff like this.
[04:27.09]So like, we at least have like fucking... We have like 25 minutes worth of content here.
[04:32.48]You know, I'm going to walk up to somebody and be like, let me tell you something.
[04:34.79]Listen to me.
[04:35.55]And he's going to shoot me in the head and we'll all laugh about it for like five seconds.
[04:39.15]There it is.
[04:39.87]There's your whole stream.
[04:43.45]It's about communication in this game.
[04:49.19]That's 10% better than PUBG.
[04:55.04]It's nothing like PUBG.
[04:57.46]I'm just being a facetious asshole.
[04:59.50]Don't worry.
[05:01.38]Yeah, I'm not gonna be able to get on this streamer list, guys.
[05:05.01]I gotta climb the fame leaderboard.
[05:06.97]Aw, damn it.
[05:08.93]How am I ever gonna be taken seriously as a streamer now?
[05:11.89]If I'm not on the top 100 in... What's the name of this game?
[05:17.23]Save Our Ship?
[05:20.68]You look like I ate a sandwich an hour ago.
[05:24.20]Yeah, dude.
[05:24.80]I gotta get, like, up here.
[05:25.90]I gotta be, like, in the top 50 fame!
[05:31.04]Finally, I'll be able to put that on my bio.
[05:33.74]My Twitter bio.
[05:35.90]Jerma985.
[05:37.12]Number 82.
[05:40.60]In SOS.
[05:42.96]My fame level up.
[05:44.01]Fuck.
[05:44.39]My survival level up.
[05:45.41]Hold on a second.
[05:47.37]Some would say that fame... Survival is better than fame, I guess.
[05:52.27]It's alright.
[05:53.29]Alright, let's go.
[05:54.79]I'm currently unproven.
[05:55.95]I have no idea what's going on.
[05:59.22]I have no idea how to play.
[06:00.90]Guys, I just opened up this fucking game right now.
[06:03.64]That's it.
[06:04.50]Let's go.
[06:06.98]I don't know what's going to happen.
[06:10.40]We're doing this together.
[06:17.23]People are going to be less impressed with me because of this game.
[06:22.89]Hey, thank you XenoFFXP for the five bucks.
[06:27.10]Sawdust Bunnies for the 10 bucks.
[06:28.54]Thanks a lot, guys.
[06:30.08]Gabe Degrossi for the $1.
[06:31.38]Do you think these Battle Royale games will eventually end?
[06:34.36]We kind of just touched upon that.
[06:35.92]Now, yes.
[06:37.86]This is currently the League of Legends clone of current popular video games.
[06:43.21]So, yes, I do believe at some point, yeah.
[06:47.23]Thank you, though.
[06:47.67]Thank you to Radical Corgi for the $1.

[07:30.70]What's happening here?
[07:36.02]Oh, shit.
[07:36.96]My mic is set to hold to mute.
[07:40.45]No, it should be hold to talk, not hold to mute.
[07:42.85]What did I do?
[07:43.37]Are these people... Can they fucking hear me?
[07:50.24]I hope not.
[07:53.02]This is half of this audience right now.
[07:58.59]Oh, they have a website you can go watch.
[08:01.13]Oh.
[08:02.15]The audio- oh, quick, we're losing the audience.

[09:30.29]I'm ready.
[09:31.71]I'm gonna- I'm gonna- I'm gonna crack under the pressure.
[09:39.50]I'm up.
[09:39.82]Here we go.
[09:42.14]Guys, my plane crashed!
[09:43.44]I was able to make it out alive with a couple of supplies.
[09:45.38]Team up with me if you- I fucked up.
[09:52.07]I fucked up.
[10:00.23]Oh shit, they know who I am.
[10:03.53]That means I'm going to get a bunch of free stuff.
[10:05.97]That's how it works.
[10:07.37]Wait, a... Is this a plane?
[10:16.18]Uh oh, this is kind of running like shit.
[10:19.98]Yeah, I did.
[10:24.92]Who's there?
[10:26.66]Hello?
[10:27.62]Who's just talking?
[10:34.05]Where are you?
[10:35.29]Give me your general location.
[10:36.69]When you press M, what number are you closest to?
[10:42.53]Hold on, let me see.
[10:46.93]I'm really close to 13.
[10:48.31]13?
[10:51.23]Okay.
[10:55.55]What is this island?
[10:56.39]What kind of demonic people are here?
[10:58.25]Why are you the only person I can talk to?
[11:07.24]Can you repeat that for me, please?
[11:13.42]I just sat down when I did that.
[11:15.16]It was incorrect.
[11:20.31]I'm over at 13.
[11:21.75]Just come find me, okay?
[11:23.15]I'm going to pick up some rocks in the meantime.
[11:32.19]You can just punch?
[11:33.56]What's the goal?
[11:34.18]I have to find a relic?
[11:38.28]Okay.
[11:39.52]I'm currently observing a giant stingray in the air.
[11:42.34]If somebody could please get to the giant stingray.
[11:46.72]I think that's the helicopter, my guy.
[11:48.88]No.
[11:51.06]Well, whatever.
[11:52.28]That's what I mean.
[11:53.36]It's a stingray V-182 helicopter.
[11:57.68]Oh, alright.
[11:58.72]I'm not a big helicopter dude.
[12:02.46]Oh, well, I was in a plane crash, and I lost all... I have at least 25 different bags of Kit Kats.
[12:07.85]We could share it if you're good, and if you're a good enough boy.
[12:10.43]Alright, I'll give you a 13.
[12:15.35]I gotta be smart about this.
[12:17.13]Be quick.
[12:18.49]Be intelligent about it.
[12:20.21]For Christ's sake.
[12:23.59]You're standing on 13?
[12:24.29]Okay.
[12:29.26]It certainly looks like a pyramid.
[12:36.38]Ah, shit.
[12:36.98]I went by it.
[12:39.16]Hold on.
[12:39.62]This is harder to get to Disney World than it is to this shit.
[12:42.27]Hold on.
[12:46.59]I'm going to say easier, by the way.
[12:52.75]Hey.
[12:57.52]Oh, yeah, I hear him.
[13:00.70]I'm gonna find this guy and figure out where he is.
[13:05.26]Okay, are you up on the scaffold?
[13:10.84]I see him.
[13:11.44]Alright, you're making that sound like I'm a target.
[13:17.32]I'll give you my coordinates.
[13:18.74]I don't think I trust you guys anymore.
[13:20.16]I'm going to live with the sharks.
[13:30.49]But by the way, I'm armed.
[13:32.65]In case you didn't fucking know.
[13:36.51]Hey.
[13:39.33]Oh, alright, that's pretty cool.
[13:44.76]Where'd you get the knife?
[13:47.68]Hey guys, there are currently three people watching us.
[13:51.86]Is it just us three?
[13:55.03]There's a... I guess.
[13:56.95]Nope, nope, nope.
[13:58.05]Where'd you get the rock?
[14:00.01]Me streaming.
[14:01.61]Oh.
[14:02.81]Can I have that rock?
[14:03.75]Yeah, hold on.
[14:07.83]Here you go.
[14:10.90]No, no, no.
[14:12.30]You don't grab it.
[14:14.14]Oh, sorry.
[14:14.62]I'm an idiot.
[14:16.24]I just wanted to make sure it was solid.
[14:17.64]I think something's already been here.
[14:24.67]Alright, so there's bad guys in here.
[14:29.51]Alright.
[14:33.51]So, how do I know I'm in a team with you guys?
[14:38.27]Yeah.
[14:38.89]Oh.
[14:39.89]You see the green X?
[14:41.35]Aim at me.
[14:42.27]See the green X?
[14:43.33]Yeah.
[14:44.15]Okay, cool.
[14:44.75]Cool.
[14:45.19]Nice.
[14:51.61]That fucking hurt.
[14:52.79]I just like hurt myself.
[14:55.59]How do you throw the skull?
[14:58.03]Middle mouse.
[14:59.31]Okay.
[15:00.65]Thanks for the tip.
[15:01.25]I appreciate it.
[15:04.09]Yeah.
[15:06.67]So, we're trying to get to... Which one of these tokens are we getting to?
[15:10.77]Oh, shit.
[15:18.43]What are we doing?
[15:20.63]Hello?
[15:20.85]Hello?
[15:25.20]Already forget what my teammates look like was this guy on my team.
[15:27.82]I forget I already forgot These guys the same person that's how am I supposed to tell who's who?
[15:33.33]Alright, can we decipher you to somehow like you you guys are the same clothes in the same character?
[15:41.23]Oh Well, make sure you're facing me and so I know is I know who's one of you guys is gonna turn on me That's the joke, right?
[15:51.21]Oh Okay, good
[15:53.89]We technically could, uh... Broke character.
[16:00.95]We technically could fucking, uh, actually win.
[16:04.25]Oh, we're gonna win?
[16:04.85]Yeah, because there's three seats.
[16:06.89]That's not the joke.
[16:09.23]Oh, okay.
[16:09.71]So wait, there's three seats on the helicopter, and if one, two, three, that means we all three of us can get in.
[16:15.40]Yeah, but we need to find three relics.
[16:17.14]You need to have a relic to get on the helicopter, and you just signal it with a flare.
[16:20.98]Oh, cool.
[16:21.24]So we gotta find, like, all that stuff.
[16:23.55]Alright, so we're gonna head towards the relic in that lighthouse, right?
[16:31.51]Just make sure to call out enemies when you see him because I got pretty good skills with aim.
[16:35.31]What happened?
[16:35.61]Somebody got your Twitch and somebody got your Twitch and my Twitch.
[16:53.83]Oh, what the fuck?
[16:54.65]That sucks.
[16:55.93]I hate when I get, like, other Twitches inside of my Twitch, like peanut butter inside of Twitch.
[17:00.66]That's why you separate the peanut butter and the jelly, you know what I'm saying?
[17:09.63]My Twitch is twitch.tv slash, maybe there's a forward slash.
[17:16.61]Master of Comedy 209.
[17:21.51]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[17:22.27]Watch out, there's an alien!
[17:24.55]What?
[17:26.21]How do I throw?
[17:26.69]No mouse, no mouse.
[17:31.36]There are fucking... Wait, there are aliens?
[17:33.50]I think you spent too much time on pilot boys to actually, like, help us.
[17:38.80]Why are there fucking aliens in this game?
[17:40.56]People already have players, probably have guns already.
[17:42.58]Yeah, it's fucking retarded.
[17:44.74]Don't worry.
[17:46.02]Alright, I'll get another rock, don't worry.
[17:50.34]How do I pick a fight out of this shit?
[17:54.22]I didn't know they would... This fucking game, man.
[18:02.75]What?
[18:03.37]Wait, am I not allowed to swear?
[18:04.41]Is this a no swearing game?
[18:06.55]Alright, watch this.
[18:12.15]Ready?
[18:13.05]I'm gonna splinter off here.
[18:18.29]I'm gonna splinter off and be my own.
[18:19.81]Wait.
[18:20.79]Oh, I was looking for a high five.
[18:28.15]They know.
[18:28.79]I keep forgetting.
[18:30.79]I have to hold down the button to mute.
[18:32.93]I hate that.
[18:33.61]Okay.
[18:33.71]Here I am.
[18:34.09]I got us a mushroom.
[18:48.93]Oh, shit.
[18:53.49]Hello!
[19:00.64]Anybody infected?
[19:03.62]If anybody's having any trouble, I could just smear this Willy Wonka candy bar on you and you'll be clean.
[19:08.10]Okay.
[19:18.35]I just dropped it.
[19:19.01]Sorry.
[19:19.95]Alright.
[19:24.39]Sneak under there.
[19:25.01]I think we're okay.
[19:32.14]I think we're going to be just fine.
[19:34.94]Yeah, this game's in beta.
[19:38.54]I know.
[19:38.78]It's weird.
[19:39.90]When's it going to get out of fucking beta already?
[19:44.24]Where did our other guy go?
[19:48.70]I don't know, that's a good question.
[19:51.56]Where are you?
[19:53.22]How do I use the idol?
[19:55.86]Um, the idol, you just, uh, there's a monster that has it.
[19:59.12]It's like a monster.
[19:59.86]I'm coming.
[20:00.16]Where are they?
[20:01.02]You guys inside?
[20:03.10]No, we're not inside.
[20:03.98]We're to the right.
[20:06.44]Yeah, our weapons are, uh, weapons currently exist of Willy Wonka mushroom, knife, and rock that you have.
[20:12.94]Get him with this one.
[20:23.00]Yeah, but there's a big boss monster.
[20:24.62]Oh, you guys went up a hill, huh?
[20:26.12]Yeah, yeah.
[20:26.38]Yeah.
[20:26.74]There's a big boss monster that looks red that has, like, a relic strap on its back.
[20:29.65]You kill that, and you get the relic.
[20:30.85]Alright, so I'm assuming we're going to need, like, some kind of gun for that.
[20:35.77]Not a gun, necessarily, because, like, guns you usually save for people.
[20:40.53]Oh.
[20:40.95]You just use, like, a shit ton of melee weapons.
[20:43.02]Okay.
[20:45.04]What about a chair?
[20:45.66]I got a level two melee weapon, if anything.
[20:51.97]Alright, I should turn my volume up How many people are left I missed well, I don't like a superhero voice I
[21:18.32]I think it's better because like at the end of the game like in the end game when like you don't know what you're gonna do and you think there's only like two people left and someone comes out of nowhere and shoots you in the back.
[21:27.49]Can you drive cars?
[21:29.81]Oh no, but you can get guns from here though which I just did.
[21:34.15]Papaya here too.
[21:35.37]Alright, there's a pie?
[21:37.21]Papaya.
[21:37.69]Papaya.
[21:40.94]That's some good paya.
[21:45.94]I fucking hate these games, man.
[21:46.80]They're over here.
[21:47.34]They're over here.
[21:47.76]Okay, hold.
[21:49.72]Play this smart.
[21:50.56]Diplomatically.
[21:53.02]Watch out for the alien!
[21:55.24]Nice work.
[21:58.08]See you later.
[22:00.56]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[22:01.08]We got another one.
[22:04.34]Uh, it's good shit.
[22:07.84]What's in here?
[22:08.26]Guns?
[22:13.16]Got my... Got myself a hatchet.
[22:16.73]Another mushroom.
[22:18.95]Go upstairs.
[22:19.41]Where'd you get the light?
[22:23.77]You pick it up.
[22:29.71]Someone's in the underworld.
[22:31.87]Someone's in the underworld.
[22:33.60]He just blew it.
[22:35.02]Oh, shit.
[22:36.42]Oh, there's a gun here.
[22:37.52]I lost him.
[22:38.20]Oh, wait.
[22:39.36]Somebody just got shot?
[22:39.92]That was him.
[22:40.66]Oh, no.
[22:40.88]I picked up a gun.
[22:41.64]What's up behind you?
[22:42.16]Who wants it?
[22:47.90]I would love a weapon.
[22:49.18]Are you good with it?
[22:50.17]Yes or no?
[22:50.71]I am a skilled shotsman.
[22:52.41]No, I already have one.
[22:53.07]I already have one.
[22:54.75]Okay, perfect.
[22:55.67]I'm right.
[22:56.07]How many bullets?
[22:56.67]Two?
[22:58.53]That's all I need.
[23:01.27]There's a ton of ammo on the map.
[23:03.65]If you kill the black dudes, come on, bro.
[23:07.97]There's no way I'm going to be able to hit anybody with this.
[23:11.31]Let's go down here because there's people in here.
[23:13.09]Is this going to kill us?
[23:14.91]No.
[23:16.33]Like that.
[23:19.04]Are we going down?
[23:19.62]We're going down to the underworld.
[23:22.26]Alright, Ray, remember there's going to be people, so... Yeah, I know.
[23:24.97]Be ready.
[23:25.53]So, be ready to fire, right?
[23:28.23]Yeah.
[23:30.15]Alright.
[23:31.39]You just point in the direction.
[23:32.95]I'm kind of like a strategy game character.
[23:35.75]Point me in the direction and I fire and I hit exactly on point, on target.
[23:43.83]The stupid is they're wasting their bullets on their fuck.
[23:47.49]Yeah, they're wasting.
[23:48.75]I have an antidote.
[23:49.95]Antidote.
[23:51.19]Does anybody need any healing?
[23:52.99]I'm a doctor, for Christ's sake.
[23:55.51]I'm a doctor, for Christ's sake.
[23:57.79]Oh, good thing I'm a doctor because I just broke both my fucking legs.
[24:03.04]Yo, we have an antidote.
[24:04.32]We want to help you guys.
[24:04.94]I don't want to get out.
[24:06.42]Listen.
[24:07.82]Listen to me.
[24:09.94]I don't know where you are.
[24:11.32]I'm not armed.
[24:13.07]Come down, come down below.
[24:14.23]I mean, I'm very clearly armed, but that's okay.
[24:17.43]Go down the stairs, right here.
[24:22.33]Let me just tell you, I may have a gun, but that doesn't make me a bad person.
[24:29.81]That makes me somebody that's willing to work with you as long as you give me your undivided attention.
[24:35.35]Hold on, we're getting close to them.
[24:38.83]They might have killed it already, I guess.
[24:41.09]Hello?
[24:45.51]Is anyone injured?
[24:46.95]Yeah, they killed it.
[24:47.71]They killed it.
[24:49.59]Oh, shit.
[24:50.47]They got out of there.
[24:52.81]What the fuck is this thing?
[24:54.93]Where's the other exit?
[24:58.18]They must be so annoyed by this voice.
[25:01.50]Like, I won't stop being the character.
[25:04.46]I'm that one fucking annoying guy that won't stop roleplaying no matter what.
[25:10.22]And it's just like, oh, please, dude.
[25:11.96]Like, we're just trying to play the game.
[25:13.40]We just want to win the round.
[25:15.26]Oh, shit.
[25:18.38]Oh, no.
[25:20.90]Yeah, we have to actually go kill them.
[25:22.52]Yeah, they're going to have another gun.
[25:26.71]It's alright.
[25:28.17]We have two.
[25:31.87]Over here.
[25:32.91]Yep, coming, coming, coming.
[25:33.53]I just, like, shoot this guy.
[25:34.85]Let's go to the lighthouse because I don't think it's been broken in yet.
[25:39.25]We can get some good stuff in there.
[25:41.91]There's a solar eclipse over here.
[25:43.57]I think that means that there's enemies.
[25:50.39]Two bullets.
[25:52.33]That's a flare.
[25:53.61]How many people are in each game?
[25:57.58]Someone wants to know how many seagulls you saved.
[26:01.08]Huh?
[26:02.06]What?
[26:03.58]Someone wants to know, whoever's master of comedy, how many seagulls you saved.
[26:08.98]Well, that depends on how long we're talking here.
[26:12.40]How long are we talking, bud?
[26:13.74]Like, how long are you talking?
[26:14.56]Let's go over here.
[26:14.98]Let's go over here.
[26:15.50]You have to give me... Let's go towards the player.
[26:16.78]You have to speak in a unit of time.
[26:21.10]Let's say within the year.
[26:22.82]No, no, no.
[26:23.38]In seagull.
[26:27.20]That's a measurement of time.
[26:30.09]I don't know.
[26:32.37]Well, then I can't help you.
[26:34.91]RIP.
[26:36.31]RIP.
[26:36.65]That means rest in peace, right?
[26:37.49]Hello.
[26:39.54]Hey!
[26:41.18]Stop or I'm going to shoot you!
[26:43.92]Oh, he didn't stop.
[26:44.60]That's a way to make somebody stop, you know what I mean?
[26:51.76]Like, stop or I'm going to shoot you.
[26:53.12]I'm going to stop.
[26:56.76]Excuse me.
[27:00.50]Citizen.
[27:02.54]We're trying to get off this island together.
[27:04.32]Please, listen to us.
[27:06.65]Not that hard, just use your fucking ears.
[27:08.71]Alright, we gotta go.
[27:09.49]We gotta go.
[27:12.73]Seven minutes is all that remains.
[27:14.91]Come on, I walked you, I walked into that.
[27:17.83]That's really far away, oh my god.
[27:20.47]I haven't done anything this whole game.
[27:22.24]I'm about to shoot this guy in the back.
[27:25.72]Do you get anything for surviving?
[27:32.04]Somebody just did a, oh my god face.
[27:37.12]Yeah, I've just seen that, yep.
[27:38.58]Wait, why?
[27:39.20]Oh my god!
[27:40.32]Why is everybody doing- what's that- what's the guy from, uh, Up?
[27:43.38]No, not Up.
[27:46.38]What the hell?
[27:46.95]What are the Spurians- Mind you, mind you, mind you.
[27:50.45]What?
[27:51.37]Oh.
[27:52.73]It's one of those predators.
[27:53.91]Go, go, keep going, go, go.
[27:57.09]We're getting close.
[27:57.67]What's the name of that fucking movie?
[27:59.01]I gotta make this work.
[27:59.75]What's the name of that movie?
[28:00.77]Uh, not Up.
[28:03.10]Not the dumb movie.
[28:03.60]The movie was like a 98% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[28:06.42]What is it called?
[28:07.50]Like when all your emotions are different characters and they're funny voices.
[28:12.34]Citizen!
[28:13.58]I think he has a gun.
[28:15.14]Yo, we don't want to kill you.
[28:16.52]There is no harm that needs to be done to anyone here.
[28:18.78]Please, listen to us.
[28:24.33]Listen.
[28:25.11]Look, you're swarming with bees.
[28:26.37]Please, I'm a doctor.
[28:27.19]I'll take care of those bees.
[28:29.33]Yo, are you infected?
[28:30.13]I got an antidote.
[28:32.08]We have anti-beat.
[28:34.00]I have an antidote.
[28:34.80]No, listen, I have an antidote.
[28:35.64]I can help you.
[28:36.03]I can help you, okay?
[28:36.67]You better stop moving right now.
[28:37.85]Please, please.
[28:39.23]No, dude, let me, let me just... Alright, well, I've got a gun and I'm about to shoot you if you don't stop moving.
[28:43.65]Uh, where are you guys?
[28:46.85]Oh, shit.
[28:50.31]Just come here.
[28:51.35]Come here.
[28:51.64]I'm a fucking doctor, for Christ's sake.
[28:52.84]Behind you, behind you, guy with a gun.
[28:56.68]Behind you, guy with a gun.
[28:58.60]No!
[28:58.72]Oh, Inside Out, that movie sucked.
[29:06.52]Listen, man.
[29:07.32]Listen, man.
[29:07.88]Okay, listen.
[29:09.42]We can keep up.
[29:09.90]We can keep up.
[29:10.38]I saw another guy.
[29:11.02]I saw another guy with a relic.
[29:12.21]I saw another guy with a relic.
[29:13.15]Blame it on me.
[29:13.61]Blame it on me.
[29:13.99]I saw another guy with a relic.
[29:15.35]He's over there.
[29:17.59]Why does he have a World of Warcraft terrain pistol in his body?
[29:21.01]Alright, this time I'm going rogue.
[29:28.40]I'm going just pure rogue this time.
[29:31.90]Oh, I have to clap.
[29:33.48]Look, clap, clap, clap.
[29:35.54]Are they making you so mad?
[29:38.62]See, look, it's the characters from Inside Out.
[29:40.40]Here you have depressed person, you have sad, happy.
[29:45.91]Tina Fey, right?
[29:46.85]No, Amy Poehler.
[29:48.73]And then, affection, anger.
[29:51.71]Those are the emotions in Up.
[29:57.00]Inside Out.
[29:57.54]Hey, Alyssa, Alyssa, we can team up, we can team up.
[30:02.02]I saw another guy with a relic.
[30:04.81]That's so funny, like, just, like, panic.
[30:06.41]Hey, listen, listen, listen.
[30:08.29]Don't shoot, don't shoot, alright?
[30:09.55]Listen, there's another guy with a relic.
[30:10.95]We can team up and get out of here alive, okay?
[30:12.80]This is my relic now.
[30:17.04]Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[30:18.14]It's me, it's me, it's me.
[30:19.42]It's me.
[30:20.06]We're good, we're good, we're good.
[30:22.04]It's all good.
[30:22.88]Don't do it, it's me.
[30:24.76]Grab a relic and go, grab and go.
[30:28.76]Something tells me if this was, like, in real life, you can't just get away with being like, hey, it's me, sorry, I shot you four times.
[30:34.67]Doing fantastic, my friend.
[30:35.93]You're doing just fantastic.
[30:37.67]I'm glad that fucking Gollum's gonna get him.
[30:39.81]What the fuck?
[30:42.27]Oh, did we lose?
[30:44.08]He's getting shot at.
[30:48.46]Shit, no.
[30:51.30]Quick, grab on to the fucking magnet thing from the brave little toaster.
[30:54.66]Man, those are so good.
[30:58.00]Is that it?
[30:58.34]Does the helicopter just leave?
[31:11.56]He dropped a lot of groceries.
[31:15.05]I gotta get a good camera angle here.
[31:18.99]Yeah, he climbed up to try to get the briefcase.
[31:29.08]I feel like I... Does nothing hurt you?
[31:32.76]I feel like I have maybe another two or three rounds left of things I could do in this game.
[31:37.30]Before it just turns into Battle Royale game number twelve.
[31:42.46]Ah, that person got away.
[31:43.44]That person wins.
[31:46.30]Oh no!
[31:47.02]Oh, I gotta be careful.
[31:52.46]They can hear me now.
[31:53.74]Feels good, man.
[31:55.43]It feels good.
[31:56.11]I bought a founder's pack and all I got was a stupid, uh, terrible t-shirt.
[32:01.49]It was intense bloodshed, man.
[32:03.23]It was really nice.
[32:05.61]There was a betrayal here, okay.
[32:09.41]Holy shit.
[32:10.73]I love my teammate.
[32:11.93]Peace.
[32:16.36]I did what I had to do, baby.
[32:18.16]Do I get an award?
[32:18.98]Next time I will do the same.
[32:22.44]I don't get an award.
[32:23.24]I didn't fucking get one.
[32:26.16]Fan favorites.
[32:26.98]What the fuck?
[32:27.58]Where's my fan favorites?
[32:34.66]These guys are comedian.
[32:37.19]I'm the fucking comedian.
[32:44.18]Those guys were pretty mad to die there.
[32:46.66]Okay.
[32:48.54]Nobody likes the doc- I gotta change it up!
[32:50.58]Different character!
[32:51.44]New character!
[32:56.31]He's the master of comedy.
[33:01.37]I got 4 fame.
[33:02.17]4 survival.
[33:05.08]Survived- Killed by Sir Knight.
[33:07.30]Harmless and selfish.
[33:09.78]How?
[33:11.44]I shot a guy with a gun like once and hit him in the back.
[33:15.92]How much fun did you have?
[33:18.20]I had two fun.
[33:19.82]I had two fun.
[33:23.56]Alright, one more.
[33:24.52]One more with this one.
[33:26.90]Where am I on the fame list?
[33:27.84]Come on.
[33:28.10]Where's DocSquito?
[33:29.00]Somewhere.
[33:35.42]We can duo queue.
[33:39.15]I had two fun.
[33:41.67]I tried to connect with Twitch earlier and it didn't do anything.
[33:45.69]I'm going to be the guy that doesn't have the stream.
[33:48.51]You know what I mean?
[33:50.25]I don't want to connect it with Twitch.
[33:54.97]Oh, the push to talk thing.
[34:00.98]Let's go like this.
[34:04.54]Push to talk.
[34:05.50]There we go.
[34:08.80]Connect, connect, connect.
[34:10.06]No, I need to have... For me to connect with Twitch, I need to have three funds.
[34:16.34]You understand?
[34:16.76]I'm not going to connect with Twitch on a two fun video game.
[34:20.13]Maybe on a three fun.
[34:22.75]Connect it with the master of comedy.
[34:29.06]Yeah, I'm not connecting.
[34:30.48]I'm not letting these guys see my emails.
[34:34.14]I'm not going to dump them into my API unless I'm having at least three points of fun.
[34:45.58]Holy shit.
[34:46.36]Somebody give a hundred fucking dolls.
[34:48.42]I just wasn't paying attention.
[34:49.28]I was too into that like dumb fucking character.
[34:51.90]The Bison Ear.
[34:52.80]Thank you.
[34:53.18]Like five minutes ago.
[34:54.10]Thanks for the hundred fucking bucks.
[34:58.32]Jermbo, I'm not giving you these bits because your streams are entertaining or anything.
[35:01.22]I'm in trouble.
[35:02.00]I'm currently being held hostage.
[35:03.14]Please send help.
[35:03.78]This is not a joke.
[35:05.00]This is very serious.
[35:05.82]My only other option was to leave a message on Demon's Souls.
[35:11.20]Thank you, Bison Ear.
[35:14.37]Thank you so much, dude.
[35:16.35]I'll get to the other bits after the whole... Let me calibrate.
[35:19.11]Hello?
[35:19.41]Alright, should I be like... Should I be like pretend badass guy this time?
[35:25.61]Like, you have no idea, am I, Matt?
[35:27.05]Yeah, that's what I'm gonna do.
[35:31.02]Just watch.
[35:31.38]You guys are gonna hate this.
[35:32.64]I don't care.
[35:36.00]I'm getting into character on this one.
[35:37.44]And you guys are going to fucking hate this.
[35:43.33]Everyone's gonna fear me here.
[35:50.25]Oh, you guys are going to fucking hate this.
[35:52.22]Everyone's going to hate this.
[35:53.48]All 16 people are going to fucking hate this.
[35:55.80]This is going to be hard to keep up the whole game, though.
[36:09.07]Just wait till it's my... Hello?
[36:12.69]Hello?
[36:13.31]Hello.
[36:14.19]How are you guys?

[36:18.05]Yeah.
[36:21.73]I hate every fucking piece of you.
[36:26.48]You wish you could match my skill.
[36:27.62]Hey, guys.
[36:28.40]Fuck, that's not me.
[36:29.22]What?
[36:31.10]How is that not me?
[36:32.48]Back on the island.
[36:34.72]I thought that was... I just wanted my... Why am I a betrayer?
[36:39.48]No.
[36:40.34]No.
[36:41.98]That wasn't even fucking me.
[36:49.27]Friendly and generous.
[36:50.15]Hi, rampaging cheese.

[36:54.61]Not fair.
[36:55.37]I don't think I've ever met you before.
[36:56.93]Is this game right?
[36:58.13]That we met?
[36:58.63]Some of you guys wish you could match my skill.
[37:01.93]It's just not gonna happen.
[37:05.45]We can dance if we want to.
[37:06.93]We can leave your friends behind.
[37:08.71]I already hate it.
[37:09.39]I hate it already.
[37:10.05]I don't want to do it anymore.
[37:10.78]I thought that was me talking.

[37:34.56]Never gonna happen.
[37:38.20]God.

[39:06.21]I wonder who's talking on this mic.
[39:09.39]Care to identify yourself?
[39:14.81]Or are you too scared?
[39:22.07]Yeah, I would be too if I was in your position.
[39:28.13]We'll see how this ends up.
[39:37.54]They probably muted me a long time ago.
[39:39.90]I'm probably not even talking to anyone.
[39:52.90]This will be just like my training.
[39:56.06]Care to tell me where you are?
[40:00.43]I... It hurts to do this.
[40:06.81]Master said I wasn't ready.
[40:08.63]I'll show him.
[40:11.72]I have more skill and more confidence than anyone here.
[40:15.22]And I'm willing to prove it.
[40:19.78]Somebody fucking... Somebody talk to me!
[40:27.70]I'm supposed to be scavenging for fucking supply.
[40:30.72]There's a relic in here.
[40:31.86]Is that a pig?
[40:32.52]Ow.
[40:36.81]Ow.
[40:37.41]Oh, you can block.
[40:39.87]Oh, my.
[40:40.33]Okay.
[40:41.45]I'm glad the fucking one person I get to interact with is my name Jeff.
[40:46.98]Where are you?
[40:48.70]Show yourself.
[40:58.72]What did I even pick up?
[41:01.42]I have to befriend my name Jeff now.
[41:05.50]Jeff is the only person that didn't mute me.
[41:08.58]Here we go.
[41:11.36]Jeff.
[41:12.35]Jeff, come in, Jeff.
[41:15.47]Jeff.
[41:16.79]Jeff, come in.
[41:21.03]My name Jeff.
[41:22.03]Come in.
[41:24.33]God damn it.
[41:25.31]My name Jeff.
[41:26.23]Jeff, thank God.
[41:27.17]You're alright.
[41:28.33]Where are you?
[41:31.71]I thought that was a person.
[41:38.70]My name Jeff.
[41:39.94]Jeff, please.
[41:41.66]Give me your coordinates.
[41:45.14]What the fuck?
[41:49.40]I'm gonna die out here.
[41:50.52]I'm in someone's basement.
[41:54.86]That doesn't help me, Jeff.
[42:00.60]Alright, Jeff.
[42:02.13]Come to the bridge.
[42:06.51]What bridge?
[42:09.11]I'm currently... Hold on.
[42:10.75]Fuck.
[42:12.61]E-F.
[42:13.63]E-F.
[42:15.07]I'm at the bridge where E and F connect.
[42:17.55]You're a little bit north.
[42:19.99]But not too north.
[42:26.45]right above the temple you'll find me on a bridge waiting jeff god no no wait what do you mean this is a bunch of temples tranquility
[42:56.31]Just go to Tranquility and go north.
[42:58.43]You'll find me waiting.
[42:59.91]On the bridge.
[43:02.81]This is a waste of fucking time.
[43:03.89]Alright, first let me get the string.
[43:12.44]He's gonna come over here with a gun and shoot me in the fucking head.
[43:14.52]Instantly.
[43:15.10]And this is gonna be a waste of fucking time.
[43:20.34]Jim, he's gonna come over on the bridge.
[43:21.32]I'm waiting.
[43:28.16]And make sure you show me your true power.
[43:30.66]We're gonna need it versus these people.
[43:37.73]Jeff, get over here and show me your true power, quick.
[43:45.85]Alright, Jeff, I'm sorry.
[43:46.81]It's time to go.
[43:47.39]I'm coming.
[43:52.28]He's coming.
[43:52.66]Hold on.
[43:54.20]Jeff, are you here?
[43:57.48]This is secondhand embarrassment.
[44:02.97]I know, that's on purpose.
[44:05.79]I'm trying to secondhand embarrass myself in the game.
[44:10.95]Just wait till Jeff gets here.
[44:12.13]Everything will be fucking fine.
[44:17.54]Are you here?
[44:23.06]Where is he?
[44:25.68]I don't think he's around.
[44:27.00]I'm changing chat channels.
[44:29.72]Hello.
[44:36.21]Can anyone read me here?
[44:38.29]Hello.
[44:41.57]Hello.
[44:43.98]Hello.
[44:45.72]Fuck, nobody's listening to me.
[44:49.96]Wait for Jeff.
[44:50.68]I'm not waiting for Jeff.
[44:56.02]I'm gonna fucking die.
[44:56.86]I broke my... Jeff.
[45:07.36]He probably died.
[45:08.54]Somebody probably killed him.
[45:17.07]Jeff.
[45:17.25]Jeff.
[45:21.25]Jeff.
[45:27.24]I think he's dead.
[45:29.84]What is this?
[45:30.24]A knife.
[45:32.76]Good.
[45:33.90]I'm almost fucking dead myself.
[45:37.85]Hello?
[45:44.53]Where are you?
[45:49.38]You're at Tranquility.
[45:50.18]I'll be right there.
[45:51.30]Stay put.
[45:52.04]Don't get yourself killed, gosh darn it.
[45:58.21]Alright, where is it?
[46:00.25]No, I gotta go across the bridge.
[46:01.82]I gotta get to Jeff.
[46:05.22]I gotta get to Jeff.
[46:05.88]Me and Jeff have to team the fuck up right now.
[46:08.86]I think I see you.
[46:10.32]Do you see me?
[46:10.88]Okay.
[46:12.78]Jeff.
[46:13.06]Are you at the other bridge?
[46:14.50]I'm at the bridge, Jeff.
[46:17.52]Yeah.
[46:18.54]That other bridge.
[46:23.56]Just stay in tranquility.
[46:24.88]I'll be right there.
[46:29.57]This kid's gonna have like pinpoint accuracy, guaranteed.
[46:36.78]He's gonna be one of those kids that's just like really good at video games and he's gonna get like every shot.
[46:45.78]Okay, where am I?
[46:46.62]I'm like circling the temple.
[46:48.68]Jeff?
[46:51.98]I feel like I'm searching for like a kid in like a fucking department store.
[46:57.43]Jeff, are you here?
[47:00.85]Like, he's hiding, like, in the racks in the clothing department.
[47:05.23]Hey, Jeff!
[47:10.10]I'm fucking gonna lose.
[47:14.50]Save him.
[47:14.98]I'm trying to find him.
[47:16.06]I can't save him unless I find him.
[47:21.25]Jeff, where are you?
[47:23.77]I'm being shot!
[47:25.09]No, Jeff!
[47:26.93]Oh!
[47:33.44]Where is he being shot from?
[47:34.34]Where are you being shot from?
[47:40.50]I think Jeff is no more.
[47:42.72]I don't think he... Your friend Jeff is dead.
[47:46.31]I'm so sorry.
[47:47.13]He was never my friend.
[47:47.97]I was just trying to find him in the clothing department.
[47:54.03]He died right in front of me.
[47:56.29]Well, where are you?
[47:59.09]I'm at Eagle Station.
[48:00.98]Eagle Station.
[48:01.70]Okay.
[48:02.26]Eagle Station.
[48:09.50]That's really far away.
[48:10.88]You know the Tranquility Temple?
[48:15.40]The Tranquility Temple is on the left side, right?
[48:19.12]So Jeff was just wrong.
[48:21.13]Jeff was giving me wrong coordinates.
[48:23.39]Jeff didn't know where he was.
[48:25.21]It's alright.
[48:27.55]Okay, stay there.
[48:29.71]I am unarmed.
[48:30.75]I just have a little bit of a kookery and that's it.
[48:36.36]But I have information that you're probably going to want to have.
[48:42.04]Fuck, I'm going the wrong way!
[48:52.00]I'll be there in a minute.
[48:54.70]I need food.
[48:58.43]Eat the mushroom.
[48:58.99]Can you eat the shrooms?
[49:01.27]Oh.
[49:02.52]Nice.
[49:05.60]So are you still at Eagle Camp?
[49:08.78]Yes, I am.
[49:09.24]Yes, I am.
[49:11.36]I'm so fucking useless.
[49:17.42]You willing to do a little bit of diplomatic recovery here?
[49:22.40]Where are you at?
[49:24.32]I'm coming from the west.
[49:26.25]I'll be there shortly.
[49:33.56]between five and six.
[49:39.40]Am I making sense when I say between five and six?
[49:50.47]What's going on?
[49:51.03]Why am I stopping?
[49:53.65]Am I bleeding out or something?
[49:55.13]Alright.
[49:58.37]I'm almost there.
[50:01.13]Do you have any supplies?
[50:05.22]Why are people clapping?
[50:10.42]Oh, shit.
[50:10.64]There's a guy right there.
[50:13.68]Hey.
[50:14.50]Can you help me here?
[50:16.28]I'm currently unarmed.
[50:19.54]Oh, is this you?
[50:20.62]Is this the guy I was just talking to on the radio?
[50:21.88]Yeah.
[50:22.48]Oh, okay.
[50:22.84]Cool, cool.
[50:24.44]I'm infected, man.
[50:25.70]You're infected?
[50:27.54]Yeah.
[50:28.14]Ah, damn it.
[50:29.22]Let's see if we can find you a mushroom.
[50:33.04]Oh, by the way, this is for Jeff.
[50:46.52]This is for Jeff.
[50:50.88]Made it out.
[50:55.88]Alright, now... Why is there a laugh track?
[50:59.94]Why is there a laugh track?
[51:02.44]Don't laugh at me!
[51:03.78]That was me avenging Jeff's death!
[51:07.66]Oh, goddammit.
[51:15.18]I need to go find a relic.
[51:17.94]I need help.
[51:18.84]Can somebody please help me?
[51:24.67]Anybody on this radio?
[51:26.29]Is there anybody here?
[51:29.11]Yep.
[51:30.03]I'm in desperate need of medical attention.
[51:35.26]Oh, a flare.
[51:35.76]Is that you?
[51:39.82]I need help.
[51:43.38]I promise I don't have any weapons.
[51:48.51]Back to the old voice.
[51:49.51]Yeah, well, the old voice gets attention.
[51:52.91]The other one gets hatred.
[51:56.57]Anybody here?
[51:57.15]Hello?
[51:59.60]Looking for somebody.
[52:02.38]Anybody out there?
[52:03.78]Who shot the flare?
[52:10.54]Oh, god damn it.
[52:16.25]Hey, I need help.
[52:20.44]I just got killed by myself.
[52:23.86]God damn it.
[52:30.81]That was just me.
[52:35.35]At least I avenged Jeff's death.
[52:38.93]I'm not going to fuck around.
[52:39.80]We're not doing like a jokey shit character this time.
[52:43.26]I'm going to play the game.
[52:50.32]Laugh at him?
[52:54.14]Is that what that's doing?
[52:56.00]Clap and... Oh, okay, yeah, I am.
[52:57.46]Audience feedback.
[53:02.83]There's 14 minutes left of this shit.
[53:10.15]This guy's got these cool throwing knives.
[53:16.29]So that's why you can turn off the live audience, huh?
[53:19.21]This game...
[53:24.55]I have one, two, three, four, five.
[53:26.73]No, I have to stay alive next time.
[53:27.74]You want to give me two?
[53:28.50]I'm going to follow somebody.
[53:31.20]Take one.
[53:32.38]They're looking at a little exchange going on here.
[53:35.24]We're going over that way.
[53:39.04]I'm a very vicious man, I'll have you know.
[53:41.14]I feel I'm a fucking savage.
[53:43.92]Listen, I don't think you know who I am.
[53:46.98]I'm Ethan Bradbury, right?
[53:48.76]Okay, cool.
[53:50.28]I'm not actually.
[53:52.28]I'm just stealing his name.
[53:54.44]I think you're actually Ethan Bradbury.
[53:57.00]Oh, thanks.
[53:57.96]Why are we over here?
[54:00.14]Um...
[54:02.45]The audience is still laughing here.
[54:05.25]The audience loves this.
[54:07.25]Either over there by the radio tower or down there.
[54:09.97]This is great.
[54:11.21]Are these the only guys that have left?
[54:15.31]This is three versus one right now.
[54:16.93]This guy's not going to win.
[54:24.15]This has to be the only three people left.
[54:29.70]It's such a funny meme game.
[54:31.38]Look, this is the only time I'm gonna play this game.
[54:37.00]We might as well get a couple of laughs out of it.
[54:43.64]What happens if I quit the game?
[54:45.54]Am I gonna- no, if I leave match, am I gonna get like a... penalty?
[54:55.44]Oh fuck, everyone's gonna be so angry that I did that.
[54:58.87]I just, like, quit the game.
[55:04.82]No, we haven't had three fun yet.
[55:06.06]Not yet.
[55:11.40]That was still two.
[55:14.52]Connect.
[55:14.98]Connect.
[55:15.66]Hold on.
[55:18.62]Let me see what the fuck I have to do here.
[55:20.98]But you guys have to go to, like, a different website.
[55:23.29]Wait a second.
[55:27.68]How the fuck does this even work?
[55:28.68]Alright, take the stage.
[55:34.75]Oh, God.
[55:35.15]But then I have to make, like, a fucking password and I have to put my birthday and email and... No, I don't give a shit.
[55:43.03]I have to make, like, a separate account with, like, my birthday.
[55:47.11]No, you ain't... Sorry, you ain't getting my birthday.
[55:53.59]Connect, connect.
[55:57.85]No, I'll do it one time.
[56:02.61]Look, I don't even want to be on this list of people that have played this game.
[56:06.90]Because then people will know.
[56:11.68]What?
[56:19.12]What?
[56:25.71]That's not...
[56:33.71]Connect, then disconnect.
[56:36.41]Snoop Dogg was streaming this game, apparently.
[56:48.30]No.
[56:49.58]I don't... Look, I don't... You guys are already here.
[56:57.62]You already are the audience.
[57:03.14]You want me to be, like, the cringy character again?
[57:05.28]No, we already did that.
[57:06.54]But I didn't get... Look, I didn't get a chance to, like, piss people off doing that, right?
[57:10.26]I barely got a chance to talk to Jeff.
[57:15.23]I need to get, like, into, like, a group of, like, five people and just be that guy that just is taking it too seriously.
[57:29.24]Not again, please.
[57:36.66]Alright, here we go.
[57:42.75]I missed Jeff.
[57:44.73]Hey, at least we got our vengeance.
[57:48.56]Here we go.
[57:51.26]Oh my god, my pussy.
[57:55.34]Here we are.
[57:58.08]We got the quintessential, like, I'm playing an online video game.
[58:03.00]Exhibit A. My mic is just on, and you can hear my friends or kids behind me talking.
[58:08.91]Exhibit B, I gotta say something terrible.
[58:10.53]Say something terrible.
[58:11.25]Option three is be silent.
[58:12.95]Wait, that's me.
[58:13.61]No, hold on.
[58:24.44]Welcome to every online game.
[58:29.38]You know the way.
[58:30.10]We got a meme, of course.
[58:34.34]Every online video game you've ever played.
[58:38.84]I'm going to stomp on this while you watch this.
[58:40.96]Everyone's going to hate me.
[58:42.38]Check this out.
[58:42.92]Here we go.
[58:49.42]Ready?
[58:50.04]I have no idea how to play this game.
[58:52.81]That guy was serious.
[58:53.53]That guy was serious.
[58:54.25]When do I get to go?
[58:55.91]Do you know any ways?
[58:58.89]We've heard the meme four times now.
[59:00.46]How many more times?
[59:01.20]I honestly say I don't know the way.
[59:02.98]I'm just saying that.
[59:05.22]Guys, if you team up with me, we'll be best friends, I swear.
[59:07.84]Do you know that way?
[59:09.76]See, now I'm friends with him.
[59:13.08]Now people will like me.
[59:15.28]I don't know the way, but I did done fucked your mama.
[59:18.48]I just need to do that and all of a sudden people will like me, right?
[59:24.99]That's how you play, right?
[59:25.87]That's how you play these games.
[59:31.13]Oh, God.
[59:35.05]You're sold out.
[59:36.01]No.
[59:37.13]It's called, that's how you communicate with some people.
[59:40.37]They only know one way of communication.
[59:42.29]Check this out.
[59:44.17]Hey, is anybody around to team up potentially?
[59:49.46]Where are you?
[59:55.54]Interesting.
[59:57.12]Okay.
[59:59.64]I don't think so.
[60:00.44]What are you talking about?
[60:06.52]Where are you?
[60:06.98]We are now best friends.
[60:07.82]Okay.
[60:10.59]Underworld.
[60:12.11]Okay.
[60:18.98]I think this is the guy that was speaking from the heart.
[60:26.66]Let's get a win here.
[60:27.76]What do you say?
[60:32.05]What?
[60:34.89]Do a Rodney Dangerfield impression.
[60:38.35]No, I'm going to change on this guy like four times.
[60:41.63]Let's get a win, man.
[60:51.82]I'm coming to Underworld right now.
[61:01.91]Careful, watch out, man.
[61:04.09]Nobody can be trusted here.
[61:08.65]Shit.
[61:12.63]That's the last we're gonna hear of this guy.
[61:14.25]Yeah, we got some monsters here.
[61:20.67]I'm gonna fall into a trap.
[61:21.90]I wish I would just stop going the wrong fucking way.
[61:23.60]That'd be nice.
[61:29.36]Is that goat behind me?
[61:30.30]Or pig?
[61:33.74]Okay, I'm almost there.
[61:34.70]Okay, I'm gonna go on a first name basis here.
[61:41.87]Then I can know if I can trust you or not.
[61:54.36]Hello?
[61:55.74]Anybody here?
[62:01.07]Hello?
[62:06.07]What the?
[62:10.10]What happened?
[62:10.96]Wait.
[62:13.38]Guys, somebody just blew up the building.
[62:14.74]I'm not sure what happened.
[62:16.68]Oh, fuck.
[62:26.71]Where you guys at?
[62:28.11]We're like right in the middle.
[62:31.81]I'm coming to you.
[62:33.99]I gotta turn my fucking flashlight off because the other guy with the flashlight blew the building.
[62:39.25]Wait, I killed somebody?
[62:40.73]No, I didn't.
[62:41.19]Did I?
[62:41.47]I'm so paranoid.
[62:48.22]Hello?
[62:49.72]I'm currently standing right in front of the... I'm pretty much right where they detonated.
[62:56.75]I just came over here.
[62:57.93]I heard the explosion.
[63:01.41]We're on our way.
[63:11.01]Is that you guys coming up the road right now?
[63:18.15]I think I'm jumping.
[63:20.31]Can you see me jumping?

[63:30.06]I hear some noises and I don't think it's coming from Christian people, my dudes.
[63:34.20]Is that you?
[63:35.06]Yeah, that's definitely you.
[63:38.01]What's up?
[63:40.39]High fives all around, come on.
[63:41.81]You finally made it, dude.
[63:43.69]High fives.
[63:45.49]You're already teased.
[63:48.47]But I can't high five you guys just for fun?
[63:51.09]You were on Radio 1, right?
[63:52.37]Yeah, I think so.
[63:54.57]Was that you?
[63:55.43]Yeah, I was trying to get a hold of you guys.
[63:58.46]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[63:59.38]We're on 12 now.
[64:00.58]Yeah, I nearly got killed here, man.
[64:01.80]These guys just dropped a bomb over here.
[64:03.58]I don't know what the hell happened.
[64:04.41]Yeah, it's this thing right here.
[64:07.69]What is it doing?
[64:08.35]What happened?
[64:09.67]It opens the doors right here.
[64:11.81]Oh, okay.
[64:12.91]It's wired with dynamite.
[64:14.05]Yeah, I dodged a couple of them.
[64:15.21]I got a couple of potshots off.
[64:16.71]I killed two of them with a headshot.
[64:20.05]I got one headshot on one guy and I potshotted the other one.
[64:22.33]Oh, my goodness.
[64:28.14]Yeah, I took care of at least like two or three of them.
[64:31.30]Two or three players?
[64:32.19]Put that up there.
[64:32.73]Yeah.
[64:33.87]Who's shooting?
[64:34.23]Oh, shit.
[64:36.07]Everyone likes me.
[64:37.23]Yeah, I thought I heard somebody.
[64:38.51]Yeah, I don't know.
[64:40.55]Papaya.
[64:41.41]Papaya.
[64:42.75]Papayas don't heal like at all, though.
[64:44.81]Yeah.
[64:45.27]They do, actually.
[64:45.81]Hey, excuse me.
[64:46.43]Who's this over here?
[64:47.49]Excuse me, sir.
[64:48.67]Yeah.
[64:49.31]Excuse me?
[64:50.03]Are you in the party here?
[64:52.09]No, you're not.
[64:52.59]There's a guy over here.
[64:53.44]Come to me.
[64:54.86]Hey!
[64:55.34]You're getting willed by that.
[64:59.28]They're really red, like bloody, but I don't think they're black.
[65:02.28]I'm in, man.
[65:02.86]I think I might have to... I might like to take a pop shot on this guy.
[65:05.74]Excuse me, sir.
[65:06.80]Wait up.
[65:09.64]Are we not gone?
[65:11.30]No.
[65:11.95]Why not?
[65:12.27]Why would we kill him?
[65:12.95]He didn't do anything.
[65:14.07]No, he didn't do anything.
[65:14.79]Just let him run.
[65:16.27]Like, he has any chance anyways.
[65:17.33]You know what I'm saying?
[65:18.76]Yeah, fuck that kid.
[65:21.23]I mean, it is a 4v1, so.
[65:23.55]Yeah, for now.
[65:24.81]I'm saying we vote for them.
[65:26.23]We're completely talking in front of this guy.
[65:28.13]He's not even doing anything.
[65:29.63]Yo, dude, we're on channel 12, so switch to channel 12.
[65:33.15]How do I switch channels?
[65:36.86]You press Q and then scroll.
[65:38.64]98 fucking channels?
[65:41.68]There's 99.
[65:42.40]Actually, there's 100 because you go to channel 0.
[65:44.72]Christ.
[65:46.72]Okay, I've got to secure a line here.
[65:48.86]I killed him, don't worry.
[65:50.90]We are charging into Cradle like madmen.
[65:53.90]This is such a bad idea.
[65:55.38]I don't know what this means.
[65:58.18]Sorry, I got like two kills so far.
[66:00.23]Put me at the front.
[66:00.85]This is such a bad idea.
[66:01.87]We're gonna die.
[66:02.69]Counter-Strike 1.6 Pro.
[66:07.17]Sorry, we didn't know you were playing with one.
[66:08.79]It's okay.
[66:09.35]Bro, you're fine.
[66:10.11]Come on.
[66:14.90]People fucking hate my guts, man.
[66:16.32]Alright, see ya.
[66:18.38]Usually we go here once we have a lot of weapons, but uh... No, we're fine dude, we're fine.
[66:22.40]Okay, I feel like I must be infected.
[66:24.66]Punch it, punch it, punch it.
[66:26.84]Let me do this.
[66:27.44]We got a Quake Pro champion.
[66:28.82]Are you infected?
[66:29.42]Hold on.
[66:29.76]Come here, come here, come here.
[66:30.68]I'm the girl.
[66:32.70]Stop.
[66:34.76]You're probably eating mushrooms.
[66:35.92]Yeah, I ate the pie.
[66:37.30]My goal is to just passive-aggressively make everyone not happy.
[66:40.52]That's what I was eating.
[66:44.01]Day 5.
[66:44.49]They still don't know I've infiltrated their ranks.
[66:48.53]Where are all the monsters?
[66:51.91]I think we should probably change to 14, because that's the amount of championships I've won in CSL 1.6, just for fun.
[66:58.02]Why is it funny?
[66:59.02]I don't understand.
[67:10.90]Yeah, that's very random.
[67:12.74]I made it 14.
[67:14.00]Yeah, I guess, you know what?
[67:15.68]That is kind of random.
[67:17.06]That's weird.
[67:17.44]Relic, relic, relic, relic monster.
[67:19.76]I'm sorry, I'm like a weirdo.
[67:20.56]I'm sorry.
[67:23.86]I didn't like, cut the shit, man.
[67:30.36]Take out small ones too.
[67:31.40]Eat em up.
[67:35.19]I'm like, I'm pissing myself off.
[67:40.41]Okay, there's so many people working together, is there even... How many people can play in one game?
[67:47.65]Why does he like me so much?
[67:51.71]Nice, keep it up.
[67:52.61]Fight me, bitch.
[67:53.43]Fight me!
[67:53.87]God damn it.

[68:12.60]How do we... Okay, we're good.
[68:17.42]Nice work.
[68:18.54]Nice work.
[68:18.90]Easy with that last hit there, man.
[68:21.34]God, that brings me back.
[68:22.54]I remember in 1999.
[68:35.27]That championship match, man.
[68:37.13]It's bringing me back to that last hit I had in my championship mobile match in fucking 1998.
[68:41.63]What team were you?
[68:44.63]Team Capital Liquidity.
[68:45.85]Oh, okay.
[68:47.84]We were in the top 2,000, I think, teams.
[68:51.34]We were like 1,900, I think, maybe.
[69:06.29]Uh... That's awkward.
[69:12.25]Just get out of here.
[69:13.59]Oh, no.
[69:14.13]I didn't even mean to.
[69:15.57]I really didn't mean to.
[69:16.77]How do I say I didn't mean to?
[69:18.87]They just both died from the monster.
[69:19.94]They were super low.
[69:21.76]Oh, god damn it.
[69:23.48]Damn it.
[69:24.22]No.
[69:24.60]How do I say I'm sorry?
[69:28.22]Is there a sorry?
[69:29.76]No, I don't have one.
[69:34.65]I'm so sorry, can you hear me?

[82:35.86]There's a dead body over there.
[82:40.72]I don't want to get hurt.
[82:41.48]I'm not going to get hurt.
[82:42.20]Is this going to hurt me?
[82:42.94]It's going to hurt.
[82:44.69]Nope, I'm fine.
[82:47.37]Nope, hold on.
[82:54.21]Hello?
[82:59.31]This is freaking me out.
[82:59.97]Hello?
[83:03.91]That's a fucked up building.
[83:04.79]I'm going to go in here.
[83:05.35]I don't have any infections.
[83:11.17]I don't need to do that.
[83:12.37]Where's the team of four people that are going to just collapse on me?
[83:16.47]That's going to happen.
[83:20.80]Just give me a gun.
[83:23.14]Let me get to work.
[83:27.85]That's not a gun.
[83:28.37]That's a knife.
[83:28.83]I'll take it, though.
[83:32.99]Try to use the radio.
[83:34.15]I'm just going to... No, I'm not going to... I'm going to be a non-technical... Hold on.
[83:37.38]That's a person right there.
[83:40.38]Is that a zombie or is that a person?
[83:41.64]That's an alien on a cell phone.
[83:44.94]What the fuck is that?
[83:45.80]That's a person, right?
[83:49.02]I'm confused.
[83:54.33]Yo.
[83:56.35]Anybody in here?
[84:02.28]What?
[84:03.50]Hey, relax!
[84:04.66]Oh, come on.
[84:12.83]Oh, it's just one of these guys.
[84:13.89]Is there anything over here?
[84:15.65]Okay, there's something right there.
[84:16.59]What is that?
[84:19.50]Come on, come over here.
[84:23.74]Just stab him right in the pelvic bone over and over again.
[84:32.38]Is that a crit?
[84:32.90]I think it is.
[84:33.34]Alright, what do we got here?
[84:35.72]Something worth taking.
[84:36.42]Come on.
[84:37.38]This shit is locked.
[84:37.98]There's a gun in there.
[84:40.12]Can I?
[84:40.48]Oh, god damn it.
[84:41.78]How do I break the lock?
[84:44.27]What?
[84:45.99]Come on.
[84:46.85]Smash it with a skull.
[84:50.31]Get in there.
[84:51.07]Does anybody have a key?
[84:56.33]Alright.
[85:01.47]The key's probably in here.
[85:04.49]I need a key.
[85:13.29]Appreciate it.
[85:13.85]Thanks, man.
[85:15.52]We should T up.
[85:19.64]Currently one out of fun right now.
[85:24.14]It's 249 to open the box?
[85:25.82]No, it's not.
[85:26.62]Don't even say that.
[85:27.26]Don't kid around with me.
[85:31.32]It's three bucks to open the box.
[85:35.46]Where the hell is a key?
[85:37.28]Alright, I gotta remember where this is.
[85:40.08]Alright, right on the bottom of the H. Bottom right of the H. Where 18 and 17 meet.
[85:46.59]Bottom of the H. Find a key and come back.
[85:51.37]Let these papayas eat them.
[85:56.51]Yeah, we got a potential one-at-a-fun scenario here.
[86:00.68]Wait, the boxes only have cosmetics?
[86:02.22]No, that's not true.
[86:03.86]What's in here?
[86:04.20]I don't know what that was.
[86:07.64]Headlamp.
[86:08.50]Oh, actually, that's pretty useful.

[86:53.45]Go to a secure line.
[86:54.27]Go to 8.
[87:06.81]Can you not... Can you open the locks with a weapon?
[87:09.83]Or does it just break?
[87:13.67]I don't think you can open it with a weapon.
[87:15.05]God damn it.
[87:19.75]Is that you running?
[87:21.19]Tell me if you see a skull land in front of you.
[87:26.82]Wait, hold on.

[89:20.47]Okay.
[89:20.89]Can you hear me?
[89:22.05]Get to a secure line.
[89:24.05]Stay on the secure line.
[89:24.79]I don't want anyone to know this is here.
[89:30.53]If you come inside the temple...
[89:37.83]We got a lock here.
[89:39.30]A locked gun.
[89:40.06]I'm standing outside.
[89:45.46]Oh, hey.
[89:45.90]Is that you?

[89:49.40]Alright.
[89:50.74]What's up, guys?
[89:53.44]We got interesting stuff here.
[89:55.44]Interesting stuff in here.
[89:57.04]Anybody got a key?
[89:59.43]I have no keys.
[90:02.15]What is the key look like?
[90:04.87]It's right over here.
[90:06.78]I was only able to get into a medical car.
[90:08.76]Yeah, take a look at this thing.
[90:11.51]Need to find a scientist to get into there.
[90:16.33]Try to push him off.
[90:17.49]That's a flare gun.
[90:18.95]That's a flare gun?
[90:20.83]Yeah.
[90:21.45]Oh.
[90:23.05]Oh, that makes me useless.
[90:24.65]That makes me fucking useless.
[90:26.63]No, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait.
[90:27.67]Don't kill me yet.
[90:28.25]Hold on.
[90:30.85]There's more.
[90:31.19]There's another locked gun.
[90:32.21]You know, over like over at the D section over here.
[90:34.96]Follow me.
[90:40.77]I gotta bail out these guys.
[90:46.05]Just follow me this way.
[90:49.88]Infinite IQ.
[90:50.98]Alright, the first person that I see, I'm throwing this and gonna hit them right in the head.
[90:59.92]I'm gonna throw the skull into their skull.
[91:04.51]See, now we did a contract in blood.
[91:06.81]That means we can no longer be mad at each other.
[91:11.18]was anger over an issue.
[91:13.58]I mean, it's constantly something I'm aware of and thinking of.
[91:16.08]I can read people pretty well.
[91:17.12]For instance, I can see you look a little irritated with me at the moment.
[91:20.00]You don't have to say anything.
[91:22.24]I'm fine.
[91:24.26]But this guy has an iPhone.
[91:25.44]He does have an iPhone.
[91:28.04]Let's just keep going.
[91:29.22]Yeah.
[91:29.46]Alright, who wants to play Geronimo?
[91:35.11]I don't think that's a good idea.
[91:36.75]Alright, I'll go first.
[91:40.77]See?
[91:43.92]Yeah.
[91:47.16]I thought they were just gonna both turn the fuck around and walk away.
[91:50.08]That would've been so funny.
[91:51.02]Now let's go find somebody.
[91:58.99]What a dumbass.
[92:04.67]Let's actually try to get one of the relics then.
[92:08.15]Alright.
[92:08.79]I don't know where to start, so, lead the way.
[92:12.42]Alright, me leading the way is the best idea that you probably have, so let's go.
[92:16.22]That's the best idea anyone can come up with right now, is me leading.
[92:20.79]The closest thing that we have is the E-Camp.
[92:24.73]Yeah.
[92:25.09]And I'm pretty sure somebody already went there.
[92:27.91]I mean, I pretty much have the combined intelligence level of like four 9th graders.
[92:35.86]That's amazing.
[92:37.84]I mean, you're talking about like, that's college.
[92:39.67]You know, like 9 plus 9 is 18.
[92:41.17]That's like at least... You know, that's like a 45-year-old, actually.
[92:44.39]I take that back.
[92:45.31]Yeah.
[92:47.39]Makes sense.
[92:49.05]I wonder what you'll do with this great power.
[92:52.11]Change the world, goddammit.
[92:54.90]Oh, yeah.
[92:55.62]I never thought that really... 9 plus 9 is 18.
[93:02.74]Don't accidentally fucking kill somebody, though.
[93:07.96]Anything in the car?
[93:10.16]I already took everything from the car.
[93:11.52]Four failing ninth graders.
[93:18.28]Let's play a fun game called Find the Humans.
[93:20.53]They're going to be at the red zones.
[93:25.17]Let me in here.
[93:29.73]Something?
[93:30.03]You doing okay?
[93:30.73]Oh, you got an axe.
[93:32.97]I'm alright, yeah.
[93:33.41]That's alright.
[93:37.79]Human beings have like 60 pints of blood.
[93:39.43]I'll be fine.
[93:44.34]You could put me in at least like 10 of those gigantic Super Bowl Gatorade containers.
[93:48.78]I'm gonna be fine.
[93:52.92]You're using the axe to break down pieces of wood.
[93:56.15]You're an amazing guy.
[93:57.77]Thanks.
[93:58.85]No, I appreciate that.
[94:02.09]Some of us are trying, right, dude?
[94:09.05]Why?
[94:09.89]Why would I say that?
[94:10.67]That was just mean.
[94:14.96]Need a knife?
[94:24.52]Got an extra knife if somebody needs it.
[94:26.77]Just passive-aggressive.
[94:31.49]Can we get in here or no?
[94:32.21]Nice.
[94:41.30]Look at all these crates everywhere.
[94:44.10]They're all locked.
[94:46.74]All of them are locked.
[94:47.42]Oh, I found some ammo.
[94:50.58]What does the generator do?
[94:54.18]Turns the lights on.
[94:55.44]Okay, well, that's practical.
[95:01.91]Anything over here?
[95:02.41]No.
[95:06.43]Should we just sit in here?
[95:10.97]I think what we need to do.
[95:12.31]It generates.
[95:14.59]Is get the relic.
[95:20.95]You think we can handle the relic?
[95:21.96]Hey.
[95:23.72]I got some veins popping out there.
[95:26.30]Maybe somebody did some of the work for us.
[95:29.08]Maybe.
[95:29.32]That's true.
[95:29.84]You know what I'm saying?
[95:34.78]I'm seeing skulls just laying around here.
[95:36.40]So somebody threw this skull in hopes of accomplishing something.
[95:43.85]Yeah, I say we... Where's the nearest relic?
[95:48.23]Here.
[95:50.71]Somebody already probably got it?
[95:53.23]Probably.
[95:53.73]Kill someone?
[95:54.57]No, I don't want to like... I don't want to just murder these guys.
[95:58.26]What did they do that was so wrong?
[95:59.34]Oh, yeah.
[96:02.40]Oh, a gun.
[96:03.04]Okay.
[96:03.40]Well, okay.
[96:04.82]Let's do this diplomatically.
[96:05.80]What do you say?
[96:09.92]Alright, so, yeah.
[96:12.70]No, don't worry.
[96:13.16]Nothing bad's going to happen.
[96:14.22]What you do is you shoot that lock right there.
[96:16.14]That's what you do.
[96:16.87]Really?
[96:17.17]Is that how you can do that?
[96:18.47]Shoot the lock.
[96:21.41]Oh, whoa.
[96:22.19]Nice.
[96:24.43]I think you should have the gun.
[96:27.63]Probably.
[96:28.75]You're about to turn as well.
[96:29.97]What do you mean I'm about to turn?
[96:31.49]I'm about to turn?
[96:36.19]Probably.
[96:36.81]Yeah.
[96:37.95]There you go.
[96:38.99]You're looking better.
[96:39.59]Yeah, I'm good.
[96:40.09]I'm good.
[96:41.85]How do I hand you the gun?
[96:42.65]Just don't want to see veins.
[96:45.09]Press Y. You go on the ground.
[96:52.70]Alright.
[96:53.64]I don't feel confident with that weapon.
[96:59.55]Yeah.
[97:00.13]So that's how you can get open shortcuts and, I guess, kill people.
[97:05.07]I didn't really see a lot here, though.
[97:06.97]This guy has to be the leader.
[97:08.13]He knows what he's doing.
[97:10.91]Alright, so let's go shoot off some more locks.
[97:16.94]Could throw.
[97:18.30]What's the flashlight button?
[97:20.78]X, I think.
[97:22.32]So somebody already came through here.
[97:29.89]there's a chance this guy's doing a better gimmick than I was doing hey excuse me that's not true he's doing better gimmick than me he's gonna get actor I think I'm like I'm fine I think I'm healed now I think I have a lot of scorpions yeah I do
[98:00.08]Watch now.
[98:00.48]I'm gonna kill them.
[98:01.12]No, I'm not.
[98:02.12]It's been too long.
[98:02.98]If I was gonna do that stupid joke, I would have done it already.
[98:06.86]We're in for a win.
[98:07.93]I'm gonna win this game.
[98:10.17]I'm with two guys.
[98:11.23]One's a... One guy's like a really good role player, and he knows how to use weapons, and he knows where he's going.
[98:15.85]The other guy's the silent but deadly protagonist.
[98:19.62]You guys ready for this?
[98:20.40]And I'm the dead weight.
[98:21.40]So there's always the dead weight.
[98:23.79]Remember that.
[98:25.57]Every trio has to have the dead weight, and it's me.
[98:28.92]Okay, you got it.
[98:36.74]Either there's people in here, or there's dead people in here.
[98:41.70]I think we should do a little bit of a... You want to do a little bit of a gotcha here, guys?
[98:46.47]What is that?
[98:47.41]Okay, I'm going to go in here, and I'm going to be afraid like I'm running from you two.
[98:53.12]and we'll got you these guys you know what I'm saying he's not gonna work this guy just doesn't want it this guy has nothing to do with my he's like nah that ain't gonna work alright so far so good I got you like I got you got easy anything of value in here uh some health
[99:24.71]Where'd friend number two go?
[99:35.04]Why does they have zero beard?
[99:41.36]Well, the best thing we can do now, we could always just, you know, go and attack, right?
[99:49.59]Screaming our special moves.
[99:54.41]Oh, yeah.
[99:54.85]Somebody died.
[99:55.71]Yep.
[99:56.31]See, dead body here.
[99:57.46]Ooh, okay.
[99:58.00]Dead body there.
[100:00.38]So... Oh, wait.
[100:02.98]And then here's the red one.
[100:04.40]Alright.
[100:05.40]So they did get it.
[100:06.20]Alright, so they did get it.
[100:06.98]Okay.
[100:08.00]Yeah, deductive reasoning, Watson.
[100:11.15]How do I know I'm about to turn?
[100:14.37]But where did he go from here is the question.
[100:17.81]I hope I really don't turn and kill these guys.
[100:19.31]That would be so disastrous.
[100:20.78]You're the asshole.
[100:26.86]Especially if they're not paying attention.
[100:28.58]They just turn around and I just take a swing at somebody.
[100:31.36]Kill them before you die.
[100:32.72]I'm not going to kill anybody.
[100:36.41]Not yet.
[100:37.75]There's still time.
[100:40.03]I just need to get another mushroom.
[100:43.07]I need to run into another enemy.
[100:45.19]Where's the circle?
[100:45.91]Looking for another one of these... Where's the circle that encompasses everybody to make something happen in the video game?
[100:53.05]Oh.
[100:56.62]When does the circle encompass us?
[100:57.60]You know what I'm saying?
[101:01.62]I'm just like a PUBG.
[101:03.33]That's all I know.
[101:04.73]When does the circle come?
[101:10.83]Those light bulbs are always popping.
[101:14.47]That guy's making... It's like Bugs Bunny is underneath him.
[101:19.17]So, just FYI, save your bullets.
[101:22.87]Don't use them on monkeys.
[101:25.50]I've walked past so many mushrooms.
[101:28.22]Okay, I need to get a mushroom.
[101:32.56]Where's my... I'm about to turn timer.
[101:36.85]Infection.
[101:37.41]I need mushrooms.
[101:40.81]Underworld.
[101:43.17]I could use a mushroom or something.
[101:44.95]Just keep your eye out for me.
[101:47.53]Oh, yeah.
[101:48.05]You're not looking good, man.
[101:49.03]Oh, you're ready.
[101:52.45]Yeah.
[101:53.45]Oh, no.
[101:53.71]They're going to kill me.
[101:55.63]Thank you.
[101:58.73]Here, come let me know if you need any more.
[102:00.13]I gotta go.
[102:01.35]You just saved my ass.
[102:09.61]I guess it just takes over the screen?
[102:11.59]Ah, fuck.
[102:13.60]I ain't gonna accidentally hit anybody here.
[102:16.56]Nice.
[102:20.24]Nice work.
[102:24.80]Alright, so they came through here.
[102:26.24]They have a gun.
[102:26.98]Here's some mushroom, my friend.
[102:29.50]Mushroom?
[102:30.98]Yeah, there.
[102:31.32]Thank you.
[102:32.56]If you could use a bullet and open this first aid, that'd be great.
[102:36.72]I have a probe?
[102:39.14]Maybe it has a syringe for a friend.
[102:42.21]Yep, there you go.
[102:43.77]Take that syringe, and you'll be cured of your sickness.
[102:47.03]Excellent.
[102:49.47]Does it eat the syringe?
[102:52.17]Just, yeah.
[102:54.79]Oh, I thought he was going to just throw it down his mouth like Cookie Monster.
[103:00.65]Yeah.
[103:01.17]Well, that works.
[103:01.65]Nice.
[103:02.53]I've seen some horrible things in my time.
[103:06.00]That would have been really bad.
[103:07.00]So you've been here before.
[103:08.22]Alright.
[103:10.62]So how do we know if we're the only three left?
[103:15.62]Very ironically.
[103:19.84]Alright.
[103:22.52]So what are we going?
[103:23.08]Cradle?
[103:25.22]somebody uh somebody hasn't got a flare yet and we have no relic so if we're the only three left that's perfect because then there's three seats on the helicopter nice it'd be amazing there we go that's a victory you know what I mean take them when you can get them that's what I say yeah um this is like we're gonna have to the underworld now
[103:51.72]I'm just trying to steal the knife.
[103:53.20]Oh, wait a minute.
[103:54.30]Gentlemen.
[103:55.14]Gentlemen.
[103:56.00]Flare.
[103:56.64]Oh.
[103:57.56]Flare.
[103:58.44]We got a flare.
[104:01.10]OK.
[104:02.57]Shall we go for it?
[104:03.23]Alright.
[104:04.81]Yeah, I'm going for it.
[104:05.31]They used flare, so they probably have.
[104:07.57]Where did you see him?
[104:09.29]I just saw it shoot in the air from over here.
[104:13.73]Be careful.
[104:14.07]This is dangerous terrain.
[104:18.47]I don't know if this is smart.
[104:22.02]This might be the... Where did that guy go?
[104:24.46]Where'd he go?
[104:28.05]Where'd he go?
[104:28.61]Oh, he went down.
[104:34.75]Ow.
[104:35.43]Oh, Jesus.
[104:37.95]Oh, I hurt.
[104:38.63]That hurt a lot.
[104:42.23]Alright, somebody got a relic.
[104:46.75]Fuck.
[104:50.37]I'm just going for it.
[104:52.51]Guys, get on channel 8.
[104:53.47]I will communicate with you.
[104:54.67]It ain't gonna be me.
[104:56.03]Let's just put it that way.
[104:56.69]You know what I'm saying?
[104:57.27]It ain't gonna be me.
[104:58.71]Look at me.
[105:00.13]I'm a shell of a man right now.
[105:05.75]I'm heading over to the extraction point.
[105:07.63]I'll keep you guys up to date.
[105:14.51]Or they're just going to keep following me and we're all supposed to go here.
[105:24.10]Not working with Twitch integration.
[105:25.36]I don't know why.
[105:25.80]It should.
[105:27.94]Here we go.
[105:28.28]This is my opportunity.
[105:33.23]Just start singing fucking opera.
[105:36.89]Just let me be the bait.
[105:40.19]I'm really good at that.
[105:44.76]Hey, uh, come here.
[105:51.12]Sardines?
[105:53.62]Turn around.
[105:54.28]We're here.
[105:55.81]Oh, nice.
[105:57.23]Yeah, use that.
[105:59.33]That was an explosion.
[106:02.61]Where was that?
[106:03.01]I got an explosion of my own.
[106:05.65]You got bombs here?
[106:08.45]Well, that's a smoke bomb.
[106:12.49]See, they already used one smoke bomb over there.
[106:14.80]okay hey come here so six minutes the idea is one of us steals the relic depending on how many relics are out there multiple that's an easy one should just melee him
[106:41.93]Let's see if we can get a perch view.
[106:43.32]You guys stay up on the hill here.
[106:44.70]I'm going to go over there and I'm going to make some friends and then bingo, bango, you jump in.
[106:51.34]You know what I'm saying?
[106:52.70]I wish I could climb that.
[106:54.61]Okay, here we go.
[106:55.53]What was that?
[106:55.95]What?
[106:56.13]How?

[107:34.01]I'm just... I'm lost.
[107:41.07]Is this where the helicopter comes?
[107:42.35]This is my first game.
[107:43.25]Where does the helicopter go?
[107:48.11]Okay, guys.

[108:11.67]Sorry, dude.
[108:12.65]I feel so bad.
[108:13.29]That was actually really mean.
[108:14.37]I'm sorry, darling.
[108:16.13]You said hello.
[108:17.09]You were probably so nice.
[108:18.79]I don't know if he had a relic.
[108:19.79]That's unfortunate.
[108:22.93]Is that one of our friends?
[108:23.89]Perfect.
[108:26.03]What the fuck?
[108:28.67]I was a distraction.
[108:30.22]I was the distraction.
[108:31.34]You see, my plan worked out perfectly.
[108:33.10]It's too late now.
[108:36.90]Yeah, right.
[108:37.42]I'll get out of here.
[108:38.16]Don't worry.
[108:39.26]Oh, God.
[108:43.77]He wasn't on our team, so I killed him.
[108:45.67]That's how it works.
[108:46.61]You know what I mean?
[108:47.47]Oh, what the hell?
[108:48.11]I'm trying to get this guy a relic.
[108:50.22]They thought I had a relic.
[108:51.34]I ain't that good.
[108:53.12]Come on, my teammates are gonna come in and they're gonna make this happen.
[108:55.48]They have a gun.
[108:57.14]Headshot.
[108:58.62]Headshot.
[108:59.04]Come on.
[108:59.70]Headshot.
[109:02.24]Come on.
[109:02.62]Get it!

[109:08.78]What?
[109:09.36]Hey!
[109:14.77]Come on, they can do it.
[109:15.85]I have faith in those guys.
[109:16.83]I don't have the rounds, remember?
[109:19.01]Pick them up here, right here.
[109:20.35]Beautiful, come on.
[109:29.65]Where are my teammates?
[109:30.68]Are these my teammates?
[109:33.56]What we got?
[109:36.76]Nope, not these two.
[109:37.68]Come on guys.
[109:39.10]Dude, did you see that throwing knife?
[109:40.21]What an excellent... Look at that.

[109:43.23]What an absolutely epic, unbelievable throw that was.
[109:47.03]Come on, boys.
[109:47.59]Clean it up.
[109:49.73]Make my death not be in vain.
[109:50.93]One more hit on this person.
[109:51.91]Papayas.
[109:54.27]One more knife throw.
[109:54.83]You got it.
[109:55.19]Nice.
[109:58.76]Oh, epic.
[110:02.92]Epic.
[110:08.38]Epic.
[110:10.07]Oh my god, that was so epic.
[110:12.79]Guys, I'm saying like the fucking streamer quotes, don't you understand?
[110:20.13]That person just did a jump attack?
[110:23.70]Oh no.
[110:24.84]Oh, this is not good.
[110:25.86]That person turned.
[110:34.06]What is going on?
[110:37.84]Did we win?
[110:47.11]Oh, that's awkward.
[110:50.80]Wait a minute.
[110:51.08]Hold on.
[110:52.60]Come on.
[110:53.56]Smoke everywhere.
[110:55.12]Can't see what the hell's even going on.
[110:59.34]That's awkward.
[110:59.94]Did he just run to... He's running to pick up the thing he threw.
[111:02.15]I don't want to do... There's still two seats.
[111:04.87]Just both go on.
[111:07.09]Cut your losses.
[111:07.77]Uh-oh.
[111:08.55]He's in trouble.
[111:08.99]This is awkward.
[111:09.61]This is so awkward.
[111:18.00]This is very awkward, friend.
[111:19.43]This is... What the hell is this?
[111:24.89]Oh my god, this is... Yo, there's a relic here, man.
[111:28.65]This is lame.
[111:32.76]Nice, like, Saturday morning cartoon.
[111:34.56]I love how this guy's, like, not even just... He's just running around aimlessly.
[111:39.54]He's gonna get him.
[111:40.40]Oh, not the papaya!
[111:41.70]Oh, how epic.
[111:49.59]Where's the other guy?
[111:53.41]I really hope this kills him.
[111:58.01]Give him the cheers.
[111:58.79]The helicopter's gonna leave.
[112:09.36]Wait, no.
[112:09.74]Look at that!
[112:12.02]He snuck in.
[112:13.88]Is this the guy that was on my team?
[112:15.70]No, it's a different guy.
[112:19.06]Throw something at him.
[112:19.72]Quick!
[112:21.46]Ah, he's gonna get picked up.
[112:26.04]I tried.
[112:26.60]Is there one more person that needs to come over here?
[112:34.09]No, I don't think so.
[112:36.93]What's this guy doing?
[112:39.83]Quick, get in.
[112:44.67]I wish there was a replay system.
[112:48.98]Alex, how could you not help our teammate?
[112:50.78]He was running around in circles, begging for help.
[112:54.20]Oh.
[112:54.42]You know, that was a fun game.
[112:57.67]I just want to say thanks, everybody.
[113:00.23]I can't believe I got on TV.
[113:01.49]I don't know what's going on.
[113:06.95]What did I get?
[113:10.58]There were relics everywhere.
[113:11.82]I couldn't get one.
[113:18.25]What did I get for a rating?
[113:22.81]That wasn't even me?
[113:23.83]That was such a potato shot.
[113:25.51]Oh, my goodness.
[113:26.85]So many people.
[113:27.65]Oh, my God.
[113:28.23]I just want to thank NBC Studios for letting me come out here and putting me up in a nice hotel and giving that nice 99 restaurant dinner for me and my family.
[113:45.37]I'm not even on screen.
[113:46.23]What am I doing?
[113:50.79]Good job.
[113:56.40]Good job.
[114:06.76]Where's our hero?
[114:10.06]I'm doing one more.
[114:11.42]But this time, it's no- I thought that you said two quality memes.
[114:15.08]I was like, no fucking way.
[114:19.52]How am I a betrayer?
[114:22.96]Neither one of these two things makes any sense.
[114:24.36]I walked into smoke and got shot in the head.
[114:31.02]You had 333 viewers.
[114:36.72]I'm so... Part of me is glad that only 300 of you came over here.
[114:45.34]Connect again.
[114:46.48]It's already connected!
[114:47.36]Is it just broken?
[114:56.10]Alright, hold on.
[114:56.44]Let me try this again.
[115:00.14]It's going to say I'm already connected.
[115:03.99]Take the stage.

[115:12.39]Like, here it is.
[115:13.08]It's there.
[115:15.60]Does it just not do anything?
[115:17.66]I'm going to restream my own stream here.
[115:19.74]Apparently it works.
[115:20.72]See?
[115:21.62]It works.
[115:22.16]Like, here it is.
[115:22.84]It's there.

[115:27.89]They're all grayed out.
[115:31.77]Do I have to like verify my email?
[115:37.48]Enable active vote.
[115:38.48]Okay, hold on.
[115:40.58]Let me just do that.
[115:44.26]I have to stream with the hero account.

[115:52.93]Active vote.
[115:55.70]Okay, I just... I have... Active vote is turned on right now.
[116:03.18]There we go.

[116:48.95]This is gonna be the serious one, where I'm gonna actually try to win the game.
[116:56.53]And no friends.
[116:58.07]We're not having any friends this time.
[117:05.13]Oh, God.

[122:20.11]That all rhymed.
[122:22.65]Hold down F. Yeah, hold F down.
[122:28.18]Alright, we're unstoppable right now.
[122:30.40]If we lose, then it's all of your guys' fault, not mine.
[122:34.18]Okay?
[122:34.70]You fat boy, you are our leader.
[122:36.38]What did you just say to me?
[122:37.44]Excuse me?
[122:38.04]I said you're thick, and I like it.
[122:40.22]No put-downs.
[122:40.92]I'm gonna give you a full minute to apologize.
[122:44.77]Go ahead.
[122:46.23]Oh, I'm sorry.
[122:46.83]I really appreciate your friendship, but I... Hey, what channel are we on?
[122:50.61]And I thought, in my country, being fat is a meaning of wealth, and I didn't mean it as an offense.
[122:56.25]I'm sorry.
[122:59.40]Testing, channel 69.
[123:01.02]Forgive us.
[123:02.07]Let's go.
[123:02.59]Let's go.
[123:03.49]Let's kill him, man.
[123:06.57]I can slay him.
[123:07.35]Guys, can we change the channel to 70?
[123:10.21]I'm not allowed to say 60.
[123:12.39]No, no, no, no, no.
[123:13.27]We're gonna go on channel 14.
[123:14.03]Okay, thank you.
[123:18.12]Testing.
[123:19.30]So, now it's not possible for us to lose.
[123:20.88]We have so many people.
[123:21.72]Like, why would the devs allow this many people to be on a team?
[123:25.50]You're right, bro.
[123:26.06]It's insta-win.
[123:27.39]Are there like 12 people that are in each game?
[123:30.09]We have like 60% of every person here.
[123:31.89]16 people.
[123:33.73]16.
[123:34.53]So that's like 61% of every person playing on our team.
[123:38.47]There's a flare gun up here if anybody happens to have a lockpick.
[123:41.69]No, unfortunately we don't.
[123:42.67]Alright, let's move out.
[123:43.55]Let's go somewhere.
[123:44.07]Let's work as a team and actually do something for once.
[123:46.53]Let's do that.
[123:47.47]Alright, you're our leader, mister.

[126:24.64]It had to be done.
[126:25.40]Why?

[126:44.66]I was doing him a favor.
[126:45.56]Alright, who do we have left on the team?
[126:52.72]Only the important members.
[126:55.54]Alright, let's be diplomatic about this if anyone's over here.
[126:58.30]Oh, this guy with the fists.

[127:28.04]Hey, hold on here.
[127:30.61]Hey, how's it going?
[127:31.53]Are we friendly or are we the antagonist of the current story?
[127:36.75]I was just investigating the flare.
[127:38.65]Okay.
[127:39.31]Got any weapons on you?
[127:40.01]Watch out for the alien.
[127:40.75]Watch out for the alien.
[127:41.49]No.
[127:41.63]No.
[127:49.45]Well done.
[127:50.15]Okay, I think I want your story arc to be you were an ex-reporter that ended up coming to the island to find your wife.
[127:58.51]Hey, this is the guy that attacked me.
[128:00.73]This one right here.
[128:01.62]This guy attacked you.
[128:03.42]Wait, I want to give him a story.
[128:04.58]Let's give him a story first.
[128:06.06]I think your story is going to be, you came here, you heard about treasure in the island, and you decided to come to find the treasure, but we didn't realize that the treasure was cursed.
[128:16.97]And eventually, when you touched it, you got like a disease or something.
[128:20.47]Yeah, you got to be more specific if it's a curse.
[128:23.50]Yeah, it's a curse where it infects his lower abdomen, which makes him vomit, but he's trying to hide it from everybody.
[128:30.80]Why are you and there are seven of you attacking him and how is he still standing?
[128:34.72]No?
[128:35.88]Do I have to do everything myself?
[128:43.21]Oh My There and now his story comes to a close.
[128:47.71]I picked up this money get like Salmonella guys.
[128:50.45]Just so you know, I have a weapon now Can I get a high five from when you guys?
[128:57.37]Welcome to the team.

[128:59.51]Thanks.
[129:00.31]It's just that there's no luck.
[129:02.35]I think I'm just going to start a riot here.
[129:05.08]This curse is colliding.
[129:06.36]Yeah, get on 14.
[129:09.20]Just checking to make sure you're all on 14.

[129:53.01]I mean, I'm just kind of like the extra who just sits in the back, you know, he's got the nice hat, the glasses.
[129:57.79]Yeah, yeah, okay, cool.
[129:59.05]You're like the guy walking down the street in New York City that's in the background of every movie.
[130:02.06]Yeah, just walking down like this, you know, just chilling.
[130:04.60]Oh, hey guys.
[130:05.56]Okay, well, you're the leader now, okay?
[130:10.54]Uh, yeah.
[130:12.04]Okay.
[130:12.60]I'll be the fucking cool one that's in the background, you know what I mean?
[130:15.02]That's like behind you doing all the cool moves and shit.
[130:18.58]Sure.
[130:19.22]Nice, okay.

[130:24.91]It was this way.
[130:28.11]He's the evil one.
[130:28.87]So whoever knows where it is, lead, and I'll follow you.
[130:31.19]Follow me.
[130:31.73]Now, there's a good chance they already grabbed the drop.
[130:41.53]I want to get a win.
[130:42.41]I'm no more fucking around.
[130:43.79]It's fun to be like a dickhead.
[130:46.41]But let's go for a victory.
[130:48.73]Let's try to actually get a relic, and let's get on that helicopter.
[130:51.03]Behind you, behind you.
[130:51.99]Look out.
[130:53.78]Oh my.
[130:54.16]Okay, easy.
[130:59.24]Easy now.
[130:59.80]We are unstoppable.
[131:00.94]Do you need some fruit?
[131:02.02]I could use a few.
[131:02.86]I could use a few fruits.
[131:03.86]Oh, there you go.
[131:04.80]You need another one?
[131:09.71]Uh, yeah.
[131:10.87]Are you good?
[131:11.25]Oh, there you go.
[131:12.61]Yep.
[131:14.55]What are those mushrooms used for?
[131:16.71]The mushrooms reduce your infection.
[131:19.13]Oh, okay.
[131:20.80]Yeah, guys, I played in the closed alpha.
[131:23.40]I'm kind of a big deal.
[131:25.38]You do?
[131:25.94]Really?
[131:27.52]I think that he should be the main character now.
[131:29.55]Yeah, I think that's a main character kind of role there, I think.
[131:32.01]Let's call him main character.
[131:34.71]Who's the new main character?
[131:35.51]Where is he?
[131:36.15]This is a lot of pressure.
[131:37.71]Black shirt guy is the new main character.
[131:39.05]This is a lot of pressure.
[131:39.97]I'm just a guy with a nice suit, the glasses, you know, hat.
[131:44.86]You're doing a pretty good job leading so far.
[131:46.36]You're walking in front of us.
[131:50.40]Protagonist, yeah.
[131:51.58]Eat him up.
[131:55.33]Okay, so in a minute here, I might have to throw a culinary curveball here.
[132:00.81]Oh, gosh.
[132:01.91]I think it might happen.
[132:02.97]Yeah, my culinary curveball.
[132:09.67]What the fuck are you talking about?
[132:12.65]I'm infected?
[132:13.22]Am I?
[132:13.42]Are you serious?
[132:15.26]I am.
[132:17.66]I'm good.
[132:18.46]Watch out for the alien.
[132:23.03]Make sure you're not stabbing each other.
[132:24.05]There's two of them.
[132:24.81]There's two of them, guys.
[132:30.53]Good.
[132:33.83]There's another.
[132:38.43]Just after I come in so late.
[132:40.01]Do one stab and leave.
[132:43.21]Where did you guys get all the knives?
[132:46.23]They're in those blue containers.
[132:49.42]It's a mushroom right here.
[132:50.54]I think you might be infected.
[132:52.42]I am infected.
[132:53.58]This is not good.
[132:54.30]Oh, there it is.
[132:58.56]Alright, where were you off to?
[133:02.62]Happy birthday, Jerma, thanks!
[133:06.32]Oh wait, I have an antidote.
[133:09.12]Who's infected?
[133:11.02]I am, but I'll be alright for a little while.
[133:12.20]I'll be fine.
[133:13.00]Don't worry about me.
[133:15.24]The infected side character always dies.
[133:19.40]That's alright.
[133:20.56]Jesus Christ.
[133:22.92]Oh, I'm gonna die.
[133:23.66]No, please.
[133:25.44]Get behind me.
[133:25.98]Get behind me.
[133:28.14]Alright, somebody else has to be a hero now.
[133:35.64]Don't worry, I'm here.
[133:36.21]I'm gonna swarm.
[133:37.29]Give me a fruit.
[133:42.91]She's dead.
[133:43.79]Alright, don't crowd.
[133:47.71]Don't crowd.
[133:48.09]Remember, don't crowding.
[133:55.24]Okay, we're safe.
[133:57.88]Papaya?
[133:59.18]Papaya?
[133:59.58]Does anybody have a papaya?
[134:00.54]I don't think anyone does.
[134:01.24]Thank you, sir.
[134:01.78]I got one.
[134:03.42]I have a med pack, too.
[134:04.89]Yeah, yeah.
[134:07.27]I picked this up.
[134:10.67]I picked a big gun.
[134:12.29]Well, thankfully I haven't been stabbed in the back yet.
[134:13.99]That's good.
[134:16.61]Wait, you have a gun?
[134:18.15]Where's the gun?
[134:18.75]Yeah, I picked up a gun in that car.
[134:23.40]No, I guess that is a pretty main character thing to do, you're right.
[134:27.50]Yeah, but I mean, I got, like, glasses.
[134:29.06]It's kind of hard to aim.
[134:30.06]That means you have better aim.
[134:31.52]That means you can see better than everybody here.
[134:32.80]No, that's not true.
[134:35.56]That means your vision's being corrected to a point where you have better vision than me.
[134:38.46]That's not how that works.
[134:41.64]Well, you're being corrected to 20-20 vision.
[134:43.38]I have like 12-6.
[134:44.16]It's been like half a year since I've got my vision checked again.
[134:48.16]Oh, shit.
[134:48.64]I'm trying to find my wife.
[134:50.34]I don't have time to go to the optometrist.
[134:52.26]You're right.
[134:52.64]Good story remembrance.
[134:54.72]Maybe I should give this to you.
[134:58.39]Yeah, you want me to take the gun?
[134:59.53]I can take it if you want.
[135:02.05]I'm trusting you.
[135:02.69]By the way, big mistake.
[135:03.75]You're all dead.
[135:04.19]No, I'm just kidding.
[135:06.23]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[135:08.21]Funny.
[135:10.31]He's a funny guy.
[135:15.17]Oh, I'm infected.
[135:16.59]Nice.
[135:17.81]This isn't part of the story.
[135:18.67]Are we doing relic stuff?
[135:21.80]Go relic hunting.
[135:24.56]Come on, let's see.
[135:25.40]Show me those fucking ha-has.
[135:31.80]So funny, man.
[135:32.60]You got a family of your own.
[135:36.84]There's too many of us.
[135:38.90]I think we might need to do a mid-season split where the main character and one of the other characters breaks off and is a bad guy now.
[135:49.36]This story is going too well.
[135:56.64]I would never give a gun to me.
[135:57.76]Why not?
[135:58.10]Define too well.
[136:01.31]Now we have power.
[136:10.18]Let's go to the area that we were in previously.
[136:13.63]Probably a better idea.
[136:16.11]Alright.
[136:21.25]Here we go.
[136:23.89]Let's go.
[136:27.34]I got plenty of shots here.
[136:28.88]I will protect the entire group.
[136:33.36]Just remember, so here's what has to, after everything I say, Yeah, but remember, I'm going to say something, you all have to repeat it at the same time, right after I say it.
[136:42.32]So we're like a unit, you know what I mean?
[136:44.24]Let's test it.
[136:46.62]Stop right there.
[136:48.24]Stop right there.
[136:49.46]Nice.
[136:50.47]Stop right there.
[136:53.53]You're about to be sent out of town, soldier.
[136:56.89]You're about to be sent out of town, soldier.
[136:59.11]So fucking good, perfect.
[137:00.55]Alright, let's do it.
[137:02.76]Alright, let's, uh, we go towards the flare?
[137:05.38]Yeah, right in here, right?
[137:06.52]Hey, let's get this guy here first, this brick gray guy.
[137:08.89]Come on, guys, but we're greedy.
[137:11.53]I don't want to use a bullet here.
[137:13.11]It's right there, guys.
[137:16.99]Okay, we got the, we got the extraction.
[137:18.67]Uh-oh.
[137:20.69]It's a seasoned climber, guys.
[137:22.29]Okay, so remember, remember the plan.
[137:23.93]Remember, eat the fruit.
[137:28.67]We kind of need weapons.
[137:31.22]I've got three skulls, it's okay.
[137:33.74]Alright.
[137:34.96]Stick to the plan, we're all gonna be fine.
[137:36.26]We've got plenty of supplies, plenty of weapons.
[137:38.34]Alright guys, I found some free shit over here, I think.
[137:41.88]Nice.
[137:42.92]Easy.
[137:43.18]Oh shit, I'm sorry.
[137:44.28]Don't fight.
[137:45.44]Two guns.
[137:46.10]Sorry, you gotta hit the bombs.
[137:49.50]Watch out, alien.
[137:50.02]Watch out behind you.
[137:56.25]I thought that was a different guy.
[137:57.61]Who's attacking?
[137:59.01]Um...
[138:00.80]I gotta shoot this guy.
[138:01.56]No, I'm not.
[138:01.84]Alright.

[138:11.26]Okay, I'm gonna die.
[138:12.44]I need some fruit or something.
[138:27.17]Oh, did something just hit me?
[138:28.83]Yeah, somebody's throwing shit at us.

[138:42.47]I see people.

[139:44.34]Who are you?
[139:44.74]What's going on?
[139:45.30]Are you on our team?
[139:46.53]Oh, shit, he is.
[139:50.14]You didn't have a green X on you.
[139:52.76]A green X?
[139:57.15]Oh.
[139:59.47]You guys want to go kill these people over here?
[140:02.11]Yeah.
[140:02.59]Hey, we should run up there and attack those guys, right?
[140:05.91]Well, that's where I'm off the leader.
[140:07.39]We got it.
[140:07.85]Hey, hey, hey, buddy.
[140:11.13]You want a mushroom to help yourself out?
[140:14.29]I think we're good.
[140:15.65]I'm gonna toss a mosquito bomb.
[140:17.37]There's poison grenades over here.
[140:18.83]Watch out.

[140:20.37]He doesn't have the green X. Hey, funny guy.
[140:22.97]Yeah, what's up?
[140:23.61]That's me.
[140:24.31]The funny guy.

[140:29.37]Thank you.
[140:29.65]He's like, hey, dude, what the fuck?
[140:37.02]He didn't have an X on him.
[140:41.30]And look, he was like up top.
[140:46.29]He, like, wrapped around and was up on the hill.
[140:48.09]He, like, freaked me out.
[140:48.93]How would we win from here?
[140:50.83]We just have to camp the extraction point.
[140:53.26]We gotta shoot down the guy with the relic.
[140:55.12]Bait him out.
[140:56.14]Yeah, he's gonna come to the helicopter.
[140:57.54]He might as well just wait.
[140:59.64]Do you see the orange stuff on the ground?
[141:02.48]Well, what a funny guy.
[141:03.62]Isn't this guy so funny?
[141:07.09]I'm gonna fucking hit one of these guys accidentally in the head.
[141:09.15]I know I am.
[141:15.25]I'm scanning the area.
[141:17.51]I'm gonna turn and I'm gonna... There's a guy right there.
[141:19.73]Guy coming in.
[141:21.83]Is that a guy on our fucking team?
[141:30.52]I can't even tell.
[141:31.08]I'm gonna shoot somebody on my own team.
[141:32.18]Alright, are we all like away from the extraction point right now?
[141:36.80]So I don't misfire and hit somebody.
[141:40.61]Yeah, he's aiming up here.
[141:43.27]He's aiming up here.
[141:43.75]He's aiming up here.
[141:45.25]Take fire.
[141:47.50]I think there's someone with a relic to our left because the trail goes that way.
[142:06.01]I got a couple hits on him.
[142:07.09]He's running.
[142:07.47]That guy doesn't have a relic.
[142:13.35]He ain't coming back.
[142:20.76]Is that him?
[142:21.32]I think the guy with the relic is to our left.
[142:23.40]No, I can't see.
[142:30.64]Okay.
[142:30.98]1999 Quake champion, man.
[142:31.90]Come on.
[142:35.37]Where's the guy with the relic?
[142:36.83]The guy with the relic on the left side, you said?
[142:38.97]I think it's somewhere to our left.
[142:40.23]I saw the trail.
[142:40.89]I'm gonna get closer.
[142:44.41]Is he just down there right now?
[142:47.33]No, that's you.
[142:49.93]I'm gonna shoot somebody in the back of the head.
[142:51.95]That's on my team.
[142:57.74]They're there.
[142:58.26]Damn it!
[142:58.70]I'm going in!
[143:22.63]You trade me the gun.
[143:24.49]Oh, the gun's gone.
[143:25.97]Gun is gone.
[143:29.13]I probably should have said that on the secure line.
[143:34.10]Hey, do you still have the gun?
[143:36.22]No, it's gone.
[143:40.76]You don't have a relic.
[143:41.80]We'll just keep you off.
[143:49.99]I'm gonna turn.
[143:51.49]No, I can't die from one of those stupid fucking enemies.
[143:54.49]Somebody left the alliance.
[144:03.31]Oh, man.
[144:05.85]I'm gonna go after people on my own team, I think.
[144:07.61]Oh, this is not good.
[144:10.45]Oh, shit.
[144:10.73]Why are you a monster?
[144:14.61]Oh, you're infected.
[144:23.17]jumping around.
[144:24.26]God damn it.
[144:27.36]Hey, I got a kill.
[144:40.02]One of my better games, I think.
[144:41.22]Good game, everybody.
[144:47.19]Damn, bro.
[144:48.35]Why you gotta do me like that?
[144:54.85]I shot- oh, that's the guy.
[144:56.93]That's the guy I shot.
[144:58.86]I shot that guy, and I, like, killed him.
[145:01.60]Spike.
[145:01.92]Spike.
[145:02.14]Ugh, this game is not for me.
[145:04.80]Last hit.
[145:05.52]On ya, boy.
[145:06.18]Hey, good game, friend.
[145:09.88]That was fun.
[145:10.96]Yeah, good game, man.
[145:11.82]Good game.
[145:12.40]Good game.
[145:12.74]Good game.
[145:13.04]Good game.
[145:13.42]Fuck you, Dora.
[145:16.16]Yeah, I know you can't survive, because I'll kick your ass.
[145:23.15]Ugh.
[145:25.68]Alright.
[145:27.10]I think I'm done with this game.
[145:28.44]Alright, where's my... I gotta see how famous I am now, right?
[145:34.41]Alright, where am I in the fame scale?
[145:48.45]Alright, who's trending?
[145:52.17]Where am I?
[145:55.81]Come on, I should be trending right now.
[145:57.71]Why am I not trending?
[146:02.01]Not even in the top 100.
[146:02.89]Damn it, I'm still unrated.
[146:12.36]Wait!
[146:12.54]I need to play one more qualifying match before being rated.
[146:16.22]I gotta do one more.
[146:17.94]Alright, I gotta get one more to see how famous I am.
[146:22.70]I have to do one more.
[146:23.56]Have to.
[146:32.28]This one's going to be real quick, don't worry.
[146:35.85]Fix the connect.
[146:36.45]There's nothing else I can do.
[146:37.79]I've tried it like five times.
[146:40.85]I've connected and reconnected and restarted at least three or four times.
[146:46.79]Change character?
[146:47.47]Fine.
[146:47.69]I like that.
[146:58.13]Here, no hat.
[147:01.72]What's with the two faces?
[147:02.60]Okay.
[147:08.70]Don't matter.
[147:09.46]That's fine.
[147:13.47]Let's go with this maroon smoking jacket.
[147:16.27]Okay.
[147:21.77]This is it.
[147:28.60]Everyone's telling me to fix it.
[147:29.84]I don't have anything to fix.
[147:31.91]I connected, I linked it to my Twitch, I restarted the game.
[147:36.36]Not much else I can do.
[147:38.44]I already tried.
[147:39.00]Like, here's the link.
[147:48.18]It's right here.
[147:49.56]I guess it just doesn't do anything.
[147:57.02]It just doesn't do anything.
[148:00.19]Apparently.
[148:06.28]It's going to start working after this game.
[148:08.26]Well, that's unfortunate.
[148:09.14]31.
[148:12.40]Alright, this will be the last one.
[148:29.54]Are we going here?
[148:34.40]What's going on?
[148:39.34]I'm just going right into one of the buildings that has a relic.
[148:48.02]Oh.
[148:49.84]Woo!
[148:51.64]Team Alpha Kill, thank you for the 1000 bits.
[148:54.32]I don't know who I am.
[148:56.76]I was on Big Brother, I know.
[148:58.70]Yo, no one ever gives me a thousand.
[148:59.80]Is this me?
[149:00.93]Our dicks are so fucking big.
[149:04.77]They are.
[149:05.69]Large.
[149:07.67]Bro.
[149:08.95]Our dicks are too big, boys.
[149:10.85]Too big.
[149:11.33]When did I get to be on camera here?
[149:16.55]I've got a huge cock.
[149:18.44]Listen.
[149:19.84]Shut up right here.
[149:20.46]This was a stink.
[149:22.16]Shut up.
[149:23.34]Suck my cock.
[149:24.12]I was on Survivor ending, brother.
[149:26.06]We got two dick comments.
[149:27.16]We got a third dick comment.
[149:28.16]I just won two challenges already, man.
[149:30.28]Something about your dick?
[149:32.36]Three for three.
[149:32.78]Something about your dick.
[149:33.42]This is going to be fucking dumb.
[149:35.28]No?
[149:35.66]Okay.
[149:37.04]Somebody's dick?
[149:39.03]No?
[149:46.41]Okay.
[149:46.77]Do I have to be the guy that says it?
[149:50.63]Remember last time.
[149:55.97]Just like last time.
[149:56.73]You and me.
[149:57.22]Hey.
[149:58.06]Oh yeah, we almost won last time.
[149:59.60]Grab that gun.
[150:00.98]And make it happen!
[150:02.38]Gotcha.
[150:07.54]Eat my asshole.
[150:09.24]No, that was eat my asshole.
[150:11.25]God damn it.
[150:12.17]I ate like three knockoff Oreos and I feel physically sick.
[150:15.97]Wait a minute.
[150:16.59]What the fuck is a knockoff Oreo?
[150:21.31]JoJo's, Trader Joe's.
[150:23.68]Sly?
[150:24.46]Is Sly161 like a regular here?
[150:28.42]Boys.
[150:32.32]Alright.
[150:33.96]Anyone out there?
[150:35.62]I'm out here.
[150:36.24]And by the way, I just want to let you know, I am one for all, all for one.
[150:40.48]For me.
[150:42.84]What does that even mean?
[150:44.46]Exactly what it sounds like.
[150:46.64]Just me.
[150:50.96]Uh... That means I am K-O-S.
[150:58.60]Like we kill you on sight?
[151:00.10]Or you kill on sight?
[151:01.18]No, no, no, no, no.
[151:02.24]Me kill you on sight.
[151:03.86]Not the other way around.
[151:07.17]So, like, we kill you on sight.
[151:09.17]Yeah, but how are you gonna know who I am?
[151:10.89]What if I change my identity?
[151:13.43]The one ring to rule them all.
[151:14.37]Let's go right for a fucking relic right now.
[151:20.30]Right.
[151:21.58]Go to the temple.
[151:25.52]Now, I'm KOS.
[151:26.54]That's great.
[151:33.43]Yeah, not even going to respond.
[151:35.69]Just stay out of my way, right?
[151:36.97]That's like a typical... Oh, we got a guy right here.
[151:39.85]Remember, kill on sight.
[151:45.94]See if I can hunt this person down and do something good for once.
[151:49.80]Check this out.
[151:50.88]I'm going to stalk this person.
[151:55.20]Yeah.
[152:01.29]They're right in here.
[152:02.33]You murdered someone?
[152:03.87]Here we go.
[152:05.75]Got my first kill.
[152:07.29]That sounds dangerous.
[152:08.19]I got messed up.
[152:13.72]Hey.
[152:16.16]Oh, hello.
[152:18.88]Are you friendly?
[152:20.42]That depends.
[152:23.80]Are you?
[152:25.86]Yeah, but you're holding a knife and you're staring at me.
[152:29.20]Watch out behind you.
[152:32.37]Oh, dear.
[152:35.81]Hello.
[152:37.31]Second kill, boys.
[152:38.05]Second.
[152:40.33]I don't see anybody's hand up here.
[152:43.31]There we go.
[152:43.77]There's a hand.
[152:44.53]We got another hand over here?
[152:47.15]That's really messed up.
[152:48.79]Alright.
[152:48.99]Let's do it.
[152:50.35]Remember, kill on sight.
[152:52.67]Everyone I eliminate, less chance that I lose.
[152:56.85]Let's do it.
[152:57.17]Let's go.
[152:58.05]Wait, Doc.
[152:58.47]Are you the guy I teamed up with last time?
[153:00.31]That's me.
[153:00.75]Doc Skido.
[153:02.18]Oh, yeah.
[153:04.78]Yeah.
[153:05.14]That's one of the reasons why I didn't attack.
[153:06.83]I noticed it was you, and I was like, you know what?
[153:08.43]I think we're going to kill on sight.
[153:10.15]And then we didn't.
[153:11.19]And then this guy came over and got a kill on sight this way.
[153:14.75]No, we're going to be a team again.
[153:15.77]Let's go.
[153:17.71]Peek-a-boo.
[153:18.57]Oh, whoops.
[153:20.09]Hold on.
[153:20.39]Wait, wait, wait.
[153:21.09]Everybody calm down.
[153:21.91]Come back.
[153:22.61]No, wait.
[153:23.00]Come back.
[153:24.18]I don't want to have to do this.
[153:25.72]That was just a sheer knee-jerk reaction, and now I apologize for that.
[153:29.96]Look, I'm going to put it away.
[153:31.62]See?
[153:31.78]See?
[153:34.59]Hey, how are you?
[153:37.91]Join the team.
[153:41.63]Team?
[153:41.87]Radio station.
[153:45.15]Radio station 37.
[153:47.26]Good.
[153:47.82]Nice.
[153:50.70]I know I will.
[153:52.58]Team on site.
[153:55.46]Alright, let's go.
[154:00.42]Too friendly.
[154:04.18]Let's go right immediately.
[154:05.44]Don't waste any time.
[154:06.08]Let's go right for a relic.
[154:08.50]What do you say?
[154:09.00]Right for a relic.
[154:10.30]Yeah, I agree.
[154:10.80]Right for a relic.
[154:11.44]I ain't gonna be, like, shimmying along with, like, seven minutes left trying to chase somebody with a relic in their hands.
[154:20.20]Watch out for the monster.
[154:30.88]Nice.
[154:31.10]Kill on sight.
[154:31.64]Good job, guys.
[154:37.23]Positive attitude.
[154:38.19]Like, it's so hard.
[154:40.98]Oh, okay.
[154:41.64]It's really hard just to actually kill on sight.
[154:45.58]Because you have to queue for this shit, and it's really, really annoying, and it takes a while to get into a game.
[154:50.90]Just killing on sight is never, like, it's not a nice thing to do.
[154:53.62]You know what I'm saying?
[154:55.38]Like, don't do this when I'm about to do it right now.
[154:57.62]Like, this poor, this poor guy just has no idea.
[155:00.42]I'm gonna stab him right in his face.
[155:01.56]Don't do this to people.
[155:05.10]Lucky.
[155:05.78]He moved.
[155:07.16]That was the only way I wasn't going to do it.
[155:08.47]I hope he's not watching the stream.
[155:14.19]I'm just kidding.
[155:15.87]I'm not going to do anything.
[155:16.61]I'm just kidding.
[155:20.05]Don't do that.
[155:21.05]Now everyone's aiming at me.
[155:26.39]Alright, no relic in here?
[155:32.48]That's like, that's one of the viewers.
[155:34.74]I'm such a fucking idiot.
[155:38.44]Oh my god.
[155:39.26]Sly, I'm sorry.
[155:40.16]I was just trying to make a point not to do that.
[155:44.20]Don't do that to people.
[155:45.18]It's not nice.
[155:47.94]Oh shit.
[155:49.44]Really what?
[155:52.43]Really what?
[155:52.81]Where'd they go?
[156:00.31]Where are they?
[156:02.05]Guys?
[156:02.25]Hey, relic right here, guys.
[156:03.41]Relic up here.
[156:05.71]That was way too quiet.
[156:09.63]Alright, make it happen.
[156:23.09]Nice potshots.
[156:23.73]Don't hit each other.
[156:25.21]Nice job.
[156:31.21]Few more hits.
[156:39.28]Watch out for humans.
[156:42.40]Watch out for humans, of course.
[156:43.60]What the fuck am I talking about?
[156:47.85]Give me that axe.
[156:52.97]I'm not hitting him too, right?
[156:55.31]Is he alright?
[156:55.83]Is he gonna be alright?
[156:58.77]This is so awkward.
[156:59.57]Alright, nice.
[157:00.95]Who wants to take the relic?
[157:04.75]Alright.
[157:06.02]We're gonna defend you like nobody's business.
[157:18.20]Humans win.
[157:23.73]Watch it.
[157:24.03]I just want the stray knives.
[157:28.83]Where's the guy with the relic?
[157:33.01]Where's the guy with the relic?
[157:34.05]Where did he go?
[157:40.04]He's not trying to, like, run out of town on us, right?
[157:45.14]No, he's just trying to escape.
[157:46.30]Okay, cool, cool.
[157:55.32]Just throw shit at him.
[157:56.18]Alright, still got a knife.
[158:00.74]Follow the trail!
[158:06.46]What is down here?
[158:08.94]Some random stuff.
[158:14.43]Wait, only the guy with the relic can get in the helicopter?
[158:18.39]Oh.
[158:19.49]Can I just take it from his back?
[158:21.29]I probably should stop saying this.
[158:22.43]I don't want to stab him accidentally.
[158:31.88]Or maybe I do.
[158:33.84]What's going on to me?
[158:35.60]Oh, easy, easy.
[158:36.36]We're in darkness.
[158:37.50]We're in darkness.
[158:40.55]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[158:44.00]I'm gonna die.
[158:44.70]I gotta get out of here.
[158:46.56]Anybody have any papayas?
[158:53.03]He knows.
[158:53.73]I have no health.
[158:57.61]I'm so dead already.
[158:58.53]I don't have a papaya necessarily, Dad.
[159:01.87]Should we go look for some?
[159:04.54]I mean, I'll be alright.
[159:06.56]If I get hit once, I'm gonna die.
[159:13.22]How do you use the first aid kit to heal somebody else?
[159:15.30]It's all good.
[159:16.29]It's all good.
[159:19.51]Don't eat him now.
[159:20.27]You can have this first aid kit.
[159:21.35]I just can't see you.
[159:22.05]Come back.
[159:26.11]The relic carrier has a gun now, does he?
[159:28.95]Oh, wow.
[159:29.33]Nice.
[159:29.93]Lifesaver.
[159:41.44]Where's that going?
[159:45.90]Where's the Relic guy at?
[159:50.02]I think he may have abandoned us to complete the objective.
[159:53.58]That's him.
[159:54.02]He's got the gun.
[159:55.38]He has a gun, too.
[159:57.93]He didn't leave our team, though.
[160:00.91]Just keep an eye on him.
[160:04.23]Alright, he's over here.
[160:09.07]Alright, let's stick together.
[160:14.00]When is he going to accidentally die?
[160:18.21]That's what I wanna know.
[160:25.25]Crates!
[160:26.74]Oh wow, there's bullets?
[160:29.16]Is there a gun in here?
[160:31.50]No gun?
[160:31.92]Come on, really?
[160:36.20]Dammit, that sucks.
[160:39.87]There's no guns.
[160:41.67]In any of these three box- four- five boxes, holy shit, really?
[160:46.65]You demand the guy with the relic's blood.
[160:54.09]Good thing I picked up those bullets.
[161:05.32]Free shit.
[161:06.26]Alright, is it?
[161:08.12]I swear to god I just saw something over there.
[161:09.98]I'm probably insane.
[161:16.18]Alright, where to?
[161:16.64]Alright, the Relic guy keeps sprinting away.
[161:19.56]Are you talking, Relic guy?
[161:22.50]Hey, guy with the Relic!
[161:23.29]I'm not talking very much, no.
[161:24.35]Where you at?
[161:24.69]I'm gonna run away and close the door.
[161:26.05]Why?
[161:26.19]You guys are wasting a lot of time.
[161:31.53]Well, that's the name of the game.
[161:33.65]We gotta waste time until we get the helicopter, right?
[161:41.12]He's gone.
[161:44.28]The relic guy just chucked the thing at me.
[161:46.48]Alright, Roger that.
[161:47.30]Where you at?
[161:48.58]That's saying I'm not trying to steal it from you guys.
[161:50.32]I don't care.
[161:51.02]I'm just... You're getting shit.
[161:55.72]Where are we?
[161:57.72]I just threw it, man.
[161:58.68]My bad.
[161:59.76]Want a papaya?
[162:02.90]The backtrack.
[162:03.66]Nah, man.
[162:04.52]I just threw it accidentally.
[162:05.94]Do you want some food?
[162:06.92]Can't open it from this side.
[162:15.47]There's first aid down here.
[162:19.47]No, there's not.
[162:19.93]I need a gun to get in there.
[162:21.13]Oh.
[162:22.84]I need to eat this.
[162:27.28]I'm currently down in the temple area.
[162:38.11]I'm currently breaking open something.
[162:42.53]Like, who cares?
[162:43.07]Why am I announcing that?
[162:44.88]I'm currently breaking that tomb open.
[162:46.86]I have to announce everything I'm doing.
[162:49.90]Is my radio broken?
[162:56.43]Where are you guys at?
[162:57.71]Where'd you guys go?
[163:00.37]Oh, there you are.
[163:06.68]Alright, let's keep going.
[163:08.44]Keep moving.
[163:12.62]There's some papayas.
[163:18.96]Damn it.
[163:20.04]Almost.
[163:21.44]Almost got him.
[163:28.56]I kind of just want to go get attacked.
[163:35.27]Yeah, the boredom bug is starting to bite me in the ass.
[163:41.71]I want to kind of just make something happen.
[163:55.58]Hey, what'd you get?
[163:56.30]Uh, nevermind.
[163:56.90]Any guns?
[163:59.01]Just the guy with the red fedora, wherever he went again.
[164:02.49]Somebody's clapping for me.
[164:03.31]Nice.
[164:03.53]I got one clapper.
[164:05.94]One clapper!
[164:15.29]Just get infected and just ruin everything?
[164:17.75]No, I don't want to ruin somebody else's game.
[164:20.11]That's not fun.
[164:20.93]That would be so annoying.
[164:22.34]If people are actually trying to win games... We already did my, like, dickhead games.
[164:28.70]You got a flare?
[164:31.58]Oh, he's got a flare.
[164:33.06]Excellent.
[164:33.36]Where are you going to use it?
[164:45.04]Well, no, I don't know where he's at.
[164:48.83]Dickhead games.
[164:50.21]I'm too nice?
[164:52.15]No, I'm not too nice.
[164:53.15]I thought he just was about to hit me with an axe.
[164:56.85]Thank you.
[165:03.69]We're just, like, sitting around here.
[165:05.69]We have a relic.
[165:07.14]So, we're winners.
[165:09.50]So, we did it.
[165:09.96]We've won.
[165:11.20]We got the relic?
[165:12.70]Yeah, but we only...
[165:14.45]You have to have three of them.
[165:16.41]Well, you don't have to have three, do you?
[165:18.95]Why would you extract the one?
[165:20.43]That means the one person gets the victory.
[165:23.55]Well, I mean, who's it going to be?
[165:27.21]I don't know.
[165:32.60]Well, let's go get more.
[165:35.04]Where are the other players?
[165:37.16]Where is everybody?
[165:40.66]We're going to go to the underworld.
[165:43.65]I got one.
[165:43.99]I'm good.
[165:51.26]No, I'm not killing them.
[165:52.08]Maybe we need to find a gunner too.
[165:56.64]I'm gonna go swimming.
[166:06.63]What the hell is that?
[166:07.23]Is that just a regular zombie or is that a super one?
[166:12.75]We're in emote only mode?
[166:13.71]What's going on here?
[166:15.78]Did somebody do something bad?
[166:16.66]Two hit zombies.
[166:18.36]Somebody being bad.
[166:25.71]What the hell are these blue things that drop?
[166:27.45]What are those?
[166:35.67]So somebody was being bad.
[166:40.91]Okay.
[166:43.70]It's been looted.
[166:51.08]Alright, let's...
[166:55.00]What's the deal with the flare?
[167:00.65]We shoot flare to call helicopter, right?
[167:05.90]Or am I totally incorrect?
[167:08.54]What?
[167:12.26]I'm going to hop channel and just see if I can find where somebody is.
[167:18.77]Check this, ready?
[167:24.17]Anybody on this channel?
[167:30.28]Hello?
[167:33.30]No.
[167:35.14]Anybody on this channel?
[167:37.82]What?
[167:38.90]Hey!
[167:42.41]You guys got a relic or what?
[167:46.41]Yeah, we're still holding the same one that we had before.
[167:48.19]Wait, are you on the team right now?
[167:51.37]Yeah, I'm on the team.
[167:53.13]Oh, why are you on two?
[167:55.56]I'm not on two.
[167:57.44]What?
[167:59.48]Jesus.
[168:02.46]What do you mean not on two?
[168:13.11]Yo, let's go.
[168:13.73]Come on.
[168:15.09]Is my radio broken?
[168:17.99]I'm on 37.
[168:18.55]Here comes the impatience.
[168:22.87]Where are we going?
[168:25.26]Oh god, I lost him.
[168:26.38]No, I didn't.
[168:27.64]Alright, let's move.
[168:28.08]Let's go.
[168:28.30]Let's go.
[168:28.62]Let's get out of here.
[168:29.88]Let's make it happen.
[168:30.40]We're going.
[168:34.23]To the, uh, extraction point.
[168:41.59]We're gonna extract that relic.
[168:44.29]One person will get out then.
[168:45.73]Yeah.
[168:45.95]But everyone else loses.
[168:47.49]Yeah, but we don't lose, right?
[168:48.59]We get points for being in the vicinity.
[168:51.92]That's not how it works.
[168:52.78]You get +2, like a plus three points for every one minute you stand next to the flag carrier.
[169:01.79]This guy, this guy's bleeding.
[169:08.79]I can't get in there.
[169:14.33]I can't even do it.
[169:15.45]There's a flare going... Where's that flare?
[169:19.75]Oh, I see it.
[169:20.44]It's way over there.
[169:25.32]God damn it.
[169:28.04]I'm gonna turn.
[169:29.22]No, I'm not.
[169:30.14]I'm good.
[169:36.49]You know what they should, like, do?
[169:37.63]They should make it so... I mean, I guess there's a time limit.
[169:43.59]But it should be, like... Oh, there.
[169:44.95]There's the time limit, right?
[169:48.49]You know like in World of Warcraft when somebody's holding a relic for too long It shows like where they are in the rock area.
[169:56.49]I feel like everyone can just kind of just do nothing for like the whole game Hey Doc, do you want another mushroom?
[170:10.75]Uh, sure.
[170:11.51]Wow, I... I pay no attention to that.
[170:14.39]I almost like threw that at the guy's head.
[170:16.89]Thank you.
[170:18.13]Take another.
[170:20.79]Thank you.
[170:21.05]Fucking god damn it, dude.
[170:25.22]I swear to god.
[170:26.70]I'm sorry.
[170:27.30]I pressed the wrong fucking button.
[170:31.96]You're too kind.
[170:40.67]I'm just going to the extraction point.
[170:42.25]I'm just gonna throw a knife at somebody.
[170:44.27]Yeah, we're running.
[170:52.07]Now kill him.
[170:52.71]No!
[170:53.99]At least maybe he'll get in the copper.
[170:56.92]He'll get inside the helicopter.
[171:01.74]I'm going for at least one kill, because I need to get my famous person rank.
[171:05.88]Right?
[171:06.08]Like, I have to get in the top 100 most famous people on Twitch.
[171:10.60]It's so important to me.
[171:13.58]I need to be at least number 81.
[171:15.12]We need to get on the high ground.
[171:18.82]Roger that.
[171:20.56]Roger that.
[171:28.75]Copper.
[171:34.23]Anything up here?
[171:34.77]I don't think anything's up here.
[171:36.67]Don't think so.
[171:45.63]Watch it.
[171:46.95]Whoa.
[171:47.65]Alright, let's keep going.
[171:56.76]Still on two.
[172:00.92]I'm going in.
[172:01.38]I don't see anybody there.
[172:06.17]No one there yet.
[172:09.39]ResidentSleeper.
[172:13.12]Don't worry.
[172:14.40]You're probably not going to see this game again.
[172:17.94]But it was worth trying and linking this game to my Twitch account.
[172:22.26]Why can I not pick those up?
[172:26.18]Come on.
[172:30.74]Alright, well, whatever.
[172:31.40]I can't get them.
[172:32.64]I cannot pick those up for some reason.
[172:34.58]Alright, well, you picked up the last one I was trying to give you.
[172:37.52]Oh, thank you.
[172:40.46]Alright, let's wrap around.
[172:44.84]Fradyo's on two.
[172:48.56]How do we get down there without getting hurt?
[172:53.43]Wow.
[172:53.77]That almost just caused a huge problem for us.
[172:57.99]You're gonna get out of here with this thing.
[173:00.91]You will make it out alive.
[173:04.70]We'll do the same scenario as last time.
[173:06.82]Just get down here.
[173:09.60]Make our way out.
[173:11.90]I think he left me.
[173:17.49]There's a guy on top of the hill.
[173:20.87]Which one?
[173:28.36]Four minutes.
[173:33.94]Oh, no.
[173:34.56]He left the alliance.
[173:35.54]Wait.
[173:37.44]Why did he just... Alright.
[173:41.53]Here we go.
[173:45.15]This is where we separate it.
[173:46.51]Time to make some moves and get him on that chopper.
[173:49.05]It's my duty to make sure he wins this round.
[174:00.32]I'm on the wrong channel.
[174:01.42]Wait, is the helicopter on top of the hill?
[174:03.88]It might be.
[174:08.92]Nah, never mind.
[174:10.36]Alright, so.
[174:12.26]Distraction.
[174:13.30]I'll make sure you get on there.
[174:15.01]I'm going to make sure you get on there.
[174:16.21]Wait for me to go in there.
[174:16.87]I'm going to get in there and I'm going to look.
[174:18.99]I see guys down there.
[174:22.89]Don't worry about me.
[174:23.61]Keep that for yourself.
[174:25.11]Godspeed.
[174:28.75]Hey, does anyone have any ammo?
[174:30.05]Do you have any ammo?
[174:31.15]No.
[174:31.31]Anybody have ammo?
[174:41.51]Where's his gun?
[174:43.33]Where's his gun?
[174:43.77]Where's the gun?
[174:44.97]Where's his gun?
[174:50.96]It's me, guys.
[174:52.14]Oh!
[174:53.08]I'm so sorry.
[174:53.96]That's our friend.
[174:54.54]That's our friend.
[174:55.14]That's our friend.
[174:56.48]Fuck.
[174:58.00]Thank you.
[174:59.39]I fucking freaked out.
[175:00.39]I'm so sorry.
[175:04.87]Alright, you're good.
[175:05.69]Congratulations on the victory.
[175:15.00]I have no friends.
[175:17.20]Alright, you get on there.
[175:18.12]Where are they coming from?
[175:19.92]That's right, they're clapping for me.
[175:26.14]I just saw a guy on the rope and it freaked me out.
[175:30.71]I'm gonna protect you.
[175:31.25]I'm about to turn.
[175:38.51]Alright, come on.
[175:40.35]One more!
[175:41.43]Yeah, you did it!
[175:46.31]Now what do I get?
[175:51.55]Nothing.
[175:58.44]Good fight, good fight.
[175:59.44]Congratulations!
[176:01.76]I did nothing.
[176:03.08]Good fight.
[176:05.20]Good fight, guys.
[176:06.56]Excellent work.
[176:09.66]That was a hero's death.
[176:10.52]Yeah, I guess it was.
[176:11.48]That's, uh, that's a load of bullshit, you know?
[176:13.52]I don't know how I could be beaten like that, but, you know.
[176:15.96]He just took over the spotlight there.
[176:17.20]Yeah, I was still feeling kinda sick from those Oreos.
[176:21.47]I should probably see a doctor or something.
[176:23.91]Yeah, just go take a shit, man.
[176:32.96]I'm a little depressed, I'm not gonna lie.
[176:36.19]I'm about fucking out of here.
[176:37.61]I'm out of here.
[176:38.77]Oh, that was so fucking bad.
[176:44.88]Wait, wait, wait.
[176:46.98]Haters are gonna hate, right?
[176:49.24]I fucking am.
[176:50.42]I don't even want to see the end.
[176:51.38]There we go.
[176:58.14]How famous am I?
[177:05.36]Perfect.
[177:07.44]That's the exact place where the CS 1.6 team was.
[177:11.02]We were 1995, whatever the hell we were.
[177:22.70]Esports.
[177:23.74]My esports career is matching up quite nicely.
[177:31.86]What the hell?
[177:32.88]Why?
[177:36.17]Aww.
[177:37.39]Oh, well.
[177:41.89]Alright, guys.
[177:43.71]I think that's going to wrap it up here.
[177:47.62]Alright, so this was a judge-it stream.
[177:55.66]Do I get to rate it?
[177:56.74]How do I rate the game?
[177:58.52]No, the stars already came up and I skipped.
[178:08.42]I would say... I mean, it's cool.
[178:17.80]I guess it's kind of cool, but... It's almost like there's... You can just team up with half the island.
[178:28.05]I feel like there should be something else going on there.
[178:30.87]It's just like, hey, high-five me, high-five me, high-five me, high-five me.
[178:33.39]We're all friends.
[178:35.21]But one of us could turn on you.
[178:36.57]I don't know.
[178:39.66]It's, it's, it's PUBG.
[178:41.30]Fucking 8.
[178:42.38]So, whatever.
[178:50.47]Only three people can win.
[178:52.87]Well, yeah, but that means, like, you, you, let's say you come in here with, like, four people.
[178:57.11]Then you just all work together until the very end, and then it's like, aha, I'm gonna turn on you, because we have to.
[179:06.00]PUBG and Rust.
[179:06.94]I mean, it's not bad.
[179:09.30]I wouldn't say.
[179:11.04]I'll probably never play this again.
[179:12.34]That was harsh.
[179:20.71]Anyways.
[179:22.31]I think that's going to be it tonight.
[179:26.80]We'll read the bits.
[179:27.88]We'll hang out for a little bit.
[179:34.70]Not as good as Quake or Counter-Strike.
[179:40.11]I'm still on the front page.
[179:42.89]You'd rather play Bot Colony?
[179:46.79]No, that wasn't bad.
[179:47.77]I could see the fun there.
[179:50.19]But probably... No, you'll never see me play that again.
[179:53.13]It's alright.
[179:55.45]Thank you, funny guy.
[179:58.43]Well, thanks for watching.
[180:01.67]So let me get to some bits here.
[180:04.03]If you just hung up for that stream, see you guys on Thursday.
[180:09.81]I'm hoping that I have some stuff come in by Thursday.
[180:16.21]Because Friday is Monster Hunter, obviously.
[180:19.51]And we're going to play the absolute shit out of that.
[180:22.09]But Thursday, if something comes in in time, we will have a lot of fun on Thursday.
[180:31.58]But take it easy, everybody.
[180:33.40]Let's get to the bits that I missed from previously.
[180:38.38]And have a great rest of your evening.
[180:42.06]Alright, let's go back.
[180:43.26]Let's go back way back.
[180:44.52]Let's go on the way back machine.
[180:48.57]Thank you to... What did I miss here?
[180:55.99]Gabe DeGrossi for the $1.
[180:58.63]Radical Corgi for the $1.
[181:01.54]Here's some money for playing this game.
[181:04.58]Okay, well, hold on a minute.
[181:05.40]That game's in early access.
[181:07.76]And that's... That seems like a fairly...
[181:12.98]far along in development game for early access so I mean it's not there's there are way worse options for early access than that it will always be in early access Monster Hunter runs like shit on ps4 for your information it doesn't really damn that's not good that's hopefully fixed by the time I play it or like a day one patch
[181:41.80]Thank you, Hydra, for the $1.
[181:43.62]Hey, Vinny watched a rat movie on stream this Sunday.
[181:48.00]Will you give him a... Well, that was a sexual comment.
[181:57.34]I apologize.
[181:58.66]Sorry.
[181:59.67]I apologize to Vinny for having to have him watch that movie because his pants... He probably shit his pants on stream because holy shit, what a fucking perfect masterpiece.
[182:12.44]So I apologize that he may have, um, been not prepared for it and his eyes may have been a little dry after that for the amount of times he was probably crying at every emotional moment.
[182:22.41]So, yeah, that's cool.
[182:27.71]I'm honored.
[182:28.11]Hope he liked it.
[182:31.25]Uh, bake me home thanks for the $1.
[182:32.59]How can I tell if the painting I bought from eBay is an original Jerma?
[182:38.42]Um, well, it has to be signed by the artist.
[182:41.86]So as long as there's a signature in the bottom right, and it looks close enough, it's probably real.
[182:48.99]Thank you, Tot, for the $1.
[182:50.09]Hey, Jerma, what's your favorite breed of marsupial?
[182:53.66]Kangaroo.
[182:54.92]Because it's the only one I can think of.
[182:57.94]Mega Moob.
[182:58.82]Mega Moob.
[182:59.54]I missed this one.
[183:00.44]Mega Moob from three hours ago.
[183:01.88]I hope you're still here, man.
[183:04.50]A $50 three hours ago.
[183:06.02]And I just missed it.
[183:07.64]Just completely.
[183:08.46]I must have been like being a dickhead in a video game.
[183:11.73]Hope you're still here, man.
[183:12.53]If you are, thank you so much for the 50 bucks.
[183:16.55]Judging by your game selection, you must be struggling.
[183:19.37]Here's something to help out.
[183:23.55]No, it's just like one of those... Look.
[183:26.30]Let me be real.
[183:27.04]Let me be real with you guys for a minute.
[183:30.16]Sometimes I get some shit for like not playing newer games.
[183:35.28]So this came out.
[183:36.32]I saw there was a little bit of potential to like talk and maybe have some fun.
[183:39.70]I played a new game.
[183:41.62]Played a new game today.
[183:43.30]So now nobody can talk shit to me and make fun of me because Jerma, holy shit, you don't play any game that came out after fucking 2004.
[183:50.48]Did today.
[183:52.95]This game is so new it ain't even out yet.
[183:59.77]It was okay.
[184:01.39]We don't mean these games.
[184:06.42]It was shit.
[184:08.66]But we tried.
[184:09.50]I tried.
[184:09.96]I just was trying a little fun thing with a new game.
[184:12.14]Remember when I did that like funny cringy comedy?
[184:16.64]Remember when I did that?
[184:19.40]I saw at least two people laugh.
[184:21.82]So there were like 3,000 people here at one point.
[184:25.22]If like two people laughed...
[184:27.26]But that's a... That's like a 0.02% comedy rate.
[184:32.27]You know?
[184:32.75]I would get a 0.02% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[184:36.73]That's alright.
[184:37.15]That's not terrible.
[184:40.15]That's all the time.
[184:43.79]Thank you though, Megamoob.
[184:44.94]Appreciate it.
[184:52.68]Alright.
[184:52.88]Good luck.
[184:53.26]Thank you.
[184:53.88]Gabe Degrossi, thank you for the $10.
[185:22.64]Thank you so much, dude.
[185:23.87]Mr. Degrossi.
[185:24.55]Can this plane crash accountant be a new Jerma character?
[185:26.80]Keep up the fun stuff.
[185:27.60]Much love.
[185:29.12]Thank you, Gabe.
[185:32.23]Thank you again for your continued monetary support here.
[185:37.25]We're also going to talk about something at the end of this stream.
[185:41.84]Some of you may have already noticed, but I don't want to really put it on full blast.
[185:45.82]So we'll just kind of wait till the end.
[185:47.82]So I'll bring it up.
[185:49.40]But nothing's wrong.
[185:51.28]It's just something that we need to discuss very briefly at the end of the stream.
[185:55.87]And it's about money.
[185:56.67]It's about a new form of payment that I'm going to start accepting.
[186:01.52]Don't worry.
[186:01.90]We'll get there in a minute.
[186:02.58]Just give me like 15 minutes.
[186:05.42]Djack, thank you for the $1.
[186:06.74]Did Virgin Atlantic pay you to play this game?
[186:09.54]I wish they did because they have a lot of money.
[186:11.94]No, I don't.
[186:12.44]I don't do that.
[186:12.96]I don't do like paid videos.
[186:14.00]I don't do paid streams.
[186:14.92]I would not do that.
[186:15.50]I would decline it.
[186:16.42]I would go in there with my stamp that says decline.
[186:18.44]I would stamp it right on the guy's forehead.
[186:21.16]And then I would like tell him to take his head and like press it down so he could get on the paper.
[186:27.28]But I wouldn't do that because that would be
[186:29.31]That would be bad.
[186:29.89]I would go to jail.
[186:30.49]No, I wouldn't do that at all.
[186:32.77]I would go in there and I would say, Hey, I'm going to put a stamp on it.
[186:36.72]I'm going to bring my decline stamp in and I'm going to stamp it on my chest.
[186:39.88]And then I'm going to grab the paper.
[186:41.10]It's going to be on the desk.
[186:43.24]I'm going to grab it and I'm going to squeeze it on my chest so it gets the ink on it.
[186:46.60]And then I'm going to hand it back to him.
[186:50.53]I would be like shirtless.
[186:51.45]I'd get arrested again.
[186:52.65]I would just go in there and say no.
[186:54.99]That's better.
[186:57.37]Uh, thank you Gabe DeGrossi again for the $1.
[186:59.25]I meant Jerma Rumble character.
[187:02.79]Well, we're gonna be needing some soon here, I think.
[187:06.95]We'll see.
[187:08.21]Depends.
[187:09.73]Great tax, thanks for the $1.
[187:11.09]I could really go for that Willy Wonka candy bar right now.
[187:16.00]Dude, you know what the crazy thing about Willy Wonka?
[187:19.18]You know, like, uh, the World of Imagination?
[187:21.52]That bit where they're walking around all eating stuff?
[187:24.58]All that shit actually was edible.
[187:26.18]They, like, made an entire edible set.
[187:28.44]How awesome would that be, just to be an extra?
[187:30.60]Or, like, a stagehand or something, and just be able to eat that shit afterwards?
[187:36.11]It was all edible, the whole thing.
[187:39.43]The more you know.
[187:42.31]Uh, MasterOfComedy209...
[187:45.13]Wait a minute.
[187:46.91]I thought I was the master of comedy, 209.
[187:48.74]Which one am I?
[187:50.84]I think it's 204.
[187:51.32]Whoops.
[187:53.88]Thank you, bro.
[187:54.40]You're trying to impersonate me.
[187:55.44]You know I can report you for the TOS.
[187:59.14]Well, they will clearly see that I was the first master of comedy and you're 209.
[188:06.08]That means we would both get reported by the actual master of comedy who doesn't have a number.
[188:12.36]So we're both fucked.
[188:15.28]No, don't throw stones if you live in a glass house.
[188:19.31]Wise words.
[188:22.41]Wait, I am the Master of Comedy 209.
[188:27.73]No, I'm not.
[188:29.11]Hold on a second.
[188:32.32]Am I?
[188:34.70]twitch.tv/Master of Comedy 209.
[188:39.24]Wait, is it The Master of Comedy?
[188:46.68]No, this is not me.
[188:47.59]I think it's TheMasterOfComedy209.
[188:53.35]I'm so lost.
[188:54.11]I have no idea who's who.
[188:58.01]I don't know.
[188:59.11]I'm gonna have to, like, go to my email.
[189:02.00]And figure out who it is.
[189:06.40]Oh, well.
[189:09.06]Uh, thank you so much, though, me.
[189:12.95]Bisonere, earlier, thank you so much for the $100 you gave earlier.
[189:19.57]Very, very generous of you.
[189:20.49]Very kind to you.
[189:21.03]Thank you so much.
[189:23.01]BobberDuck, thanks for the bits.
[189:24.68]Kappa.
[189:25.72]CommandRabbit, thank you for the $1.
[189:27.10]When's the meme funeral?
[189:28.82]So I've decided that we're going to let all of January go through without killing them.
[189:33.66]I think I at least owe them that.
[189:36.08]So, February... Let's see.
[189:39.13]February 1st is when we're going to bury them all.
[189:42.57]And don't worry, we'll say a few things.
[189:43.95]I'll make sure that you can... Somebody just called me lazy.
[189:47.84]I mean okay I mean that's partially true part of that is um I haven't been feeling well lately it's alright though it's not that I don't want yeah like I don't want these are like these are my friends right you guys think I like turn the stream off and I go do anything
[190:09.30]No, I turn the stream off and I go into, I have like a bunch of coloring books.
[190:12.88]And a bunch of pieces of art that I've made that are all over my walls.
[190:15.70]And I have a bunch of stuffed animals that I talk to.
[190:17.28]They're all memes.
[190:19.02]These are my friends.
[190:22.66]Like when a meme is created on this channel, it's real.
[190:31.14]You'll see.
[190:31.78]I think I'm making it up.
[190:36.63]Thank you, though.
[190:37.21]Thank you to Flabjack for the $1.
[190:39.37]It's my birthday today.
[190:40.13]Can you sing me a happy song?
[190:41.31]Thanks, Dad.
[190:43.30]Happy birthday to you, Flabjack.
[190:46.94]Happy birthday to you.
[190:50.28]That was the worst.
[190:50.94]That was such a phoned-in piece of shit song that I just gave you.
[190:55.24]That couldn't have been any worse.
[190:57.71]Sorry.
[191:00.69]But happy birthday.

[191:47.34]My webcam is all fucked up.

[191:55.58]Didn't expect a surprise party here.
[191:59.75]You know, I got some fucking balloons for you, too.

[192:07.65]Yeah, it is.
[192:11.85]It was a fucking month ago.

[193:16.38]Will they just ban?
[193:17.44]You know, it's a sad thing.
[193:20.16]You're probably going to have to show your ID to buy laundry detergent now.
[193:27.25]Think about that.
[193:29.33]I'm going to go to the store today.
[193:30.23]I'm going to buy some laundry detergent.
[193:31.51]Can I see an ID?
[193:34.45]I want to clean laundry.
[193:37.39]God.
[193:38.17]Fucking crazy people.
[193:41.73]They're stopping production.
[193:44.30]They're actually stopping production.
[193:45.56]Are you serious?
[193:49.82]Wait, because so many people were eating them, they're actually gonna stop.
[193:54.43]Adults are eating them too.
[193:59.83]Oh my god.
[194:01.68]Human beings can't be trusted with anything.
[194:05.81]Think of the one thing that we all know as humans.
[194:09.61]What are the three things that we know not to eat as humans?
[194:15.60]Okay?
[194:16.18]Let's go over them.
[194:18.14]Shit.
[194:20.32]Piss.
[194:22.56]Poison.
[194:24.75]Guys, dogs don't even eat their own shit.
[194:28.27]Dogs don't even eat shit.
[194:31.93]You don't eat shit, you don't drink piss, and you don't drink poison.
[194:39.91]That's it.
[194:40.45]As long as you... If you abide by these rules, you will be fine.
[194:46.10]Don't eat anybody's shit or your own.
[194:47.84]Don't drink any piss and don't eat any poison.
[194:51.66]I mean, if you can't follow those very basic guidelines... Somebody's got to step in there and find out what's going on there.
[195:01.09]Dogs do eat shit.
[195:05.56]No, no, no.
[195:06.86]You ever seen when your dog goes out and goes to the bathroom and he squats down and he makes like a chocolate ice cream out of his ass and then he turns around and he looks at it and then he like sprints away from it and freaks out and like happily runs away from it.
[195:20.07]That's what my dog does.
[195:22.05]He turns around and he like runs away from it.
[195:24.25]He sprints away.
[195:27.17]Otto knows that.
[195:39.03]Tide has commercials with Gronkowski telling people not to do it.
[195:44.29]They eat cat shit, but there's a reason why they eat cat shit.
[195:46.65]You know why dogs eat cat shit?
[195:48.59]Because cat food is super fatty and full of flavor.
[195:51.53]So it's essentially like concentrated cat food that comes out of their ass.
[195:55.07]Alright, we're going to move on.
[195:59.75]Thank you.
[196:00.51]I don't know.
[196:01.15]Alright, Jeff.
[196:01.77]Thank you, Jeff, for the $5.
[196:04.22]Can you not ditch my little brother in the woods, streamer?
[196:07.96]I tried.
[196:08.76]I avenged him.
[196:09.44]I tried.
[196:11.82]Why do you know this?
[196:16.48]It's... Who doesn't know that?
[196:18.56]Cat food... The reason... If your dog ever gets into cat food, or ever smells it or looks at it, cat food's just tastier.
[196:24.78]It has more fat and more flavor.
[196:26.84]I know this because I've eaten plenty of it.
[196:29.62]Dog food is bland and gross.
[196:31.24]Cat food's where, you know, you saute it with some onions and a little bit of noodles.
[196:36.67]Why do I know this?
[196:39.18]uh sticks sticks renegade thanks for the one dollar roses are red beethoven was deaf I'm being shot said my name is jeff oh poor jeff uh smitten sam thanks for the one dollar saw dust bunnies thanks for the one dollar gave to grossy thanks for the one dollar you just killed that poor man I it's an accident command rabbit thanks for the one dollar now that you're connected will you pay seventy dollars every month
[197:09.77]That's not how much it... Isn't it free?
[197:14.43]Mr. Degrossi, thank you again.
[197:15.88]Gabe, we are such three-star supporters, we crashed your stream.
[197:24.12]Whoops.
[197:26.79]That's too bad that that wouldn't work.
[197:28.05]I don't think it was anything on my end.
[197:30.31]Because I did connect.
[197:31.47]And, like, enabled.
[197:32.81]Restarted the game.
[197:33.55]Restarted the client.
[197:34.27]I don't know.
[197:35.47]Maybe there's, like, some bugs in the system there.
[197:38.51]Because I don't think I was doing anything wrong.
[197:42.44]Thank you, Djack, for the two bucks.
[197:44.22]Only ever donated one dollar before, but you made me cry after a bad week with your Life is a Box of Chocolates intro.
[197:50.30]So here's two dollars.
[197:53.82]Those intros...
[197:57.02]That's a fun idea.
[197:58.74]But here's the problem.
[197:59.34]We already saw the problem with that.
[198:01.87]Is... Anonymity and open mic equals... Like, somebody eventually, some scientist is gonna do a formula, right?
[198:10.01]I'll put it in chat here.
[198:10.95]Like, anonymity... plus voice chat... plus audience... equals... awful behavior.
[198:24.56]Right?
[198:24.76]Like, if somebody wants to take this formula and use it somewhere, put it into a flask.
[198:31.32]Right?
[198:31.50]Like, anonymity plus voice chat plus audience equals awful behavior.
[198:38.63]But, I like the idea.
[198:39.71]I do.
[198:40.93]What a scientist.
[198:45.17]That is so obvious.
[198:47.41]That's the story of the internet.
[198:49.42]Yeah.
[198:49.60]Yeah.
[198:52.15]You see it every day.
[198:52.85]Oh, wait, wait.
[198:54.59]Anonymity.
[198:55.63]Let's do a better calculation here.
[198:57.11]Anonymity.
[199:00.83]That's, I don't know if it's plus.
[199:01.97]Well, hold on.
[199:02.75]Plus.
[199:04.00]Voice chat.
[199:06.24]Times.
[199:07.94]Times audience.
[199:11.90]Divided by.
[199:14.44]Parents on vacation.
[199:18.14]So we get a divided by here.
[199:20.26]What's the, where's divided?
[199:25.40]It's just this, right?
[199:27.90]Equals bad behavior.
[199:34.50]Divided by Tide Pods.
[199:39.71]No, but yeah, it's an interesting idea.
[199:43.47]Bang, 9c9, thanks for the bits.
[199:45.31]No friends, kill them all.
[199:47.57]Nightfang, thanks for the bits.

[201:32.63]I have to give you money.
[201:33.43]You are guilty.
[201:35.06]Love you.
[201:37.36]Thank you.
[201:39.72]Yeah, I'm guilty of taking your money.
[201:42.18]I'm sorry.
[201:43.78]Hopefully you intended to give it to me.
[201:45.44]Appreciate it.
[201:47.20]Thank you so much, Alezzo.

[202:08.19]I'm glad that you got to play.
[202:10.05]I'm glad we got to team up against those bad guys.
[202:13.97]Hope you enjoyed the game.
[202:17.30]Uh, Sam, Sam says, uh, I have a job interview coming up and I'm a little nervous.
[202:21.76]Do you have any advice?
[202:23.67]Oh yeah, I've got, I've got some great advice for, for like job interviews.
[202:28.57]Like in, in some, like for, for, listen to this, right?
[202:31.78]So you want to show like value, right?
[202:35.10]First of all, let me just say that I am not a licensed financial advisor.
[202:39.20]So if you're going to risk, all investments have their own risks.
[202:43.76]So please use your own knowledge and your own wherewithal.
[202:47.28]This is not financial advice.
[202:49.18]This is just my opinion.
[202:50.58]So if you have an interview, what you want to do is put a dead fly in your pocket, right?
[202:57.32]Get a dead fly, put a dead fly in your pocket.
[203:00.53]And then you're gonna get in there, the guy's gonna call you in, and he's gonna be like, oh yeah, please have a seat, sit down.
[203:04.55]You're gonna be like, yeah, sure, but uh, hold on one second, buddy.
[203:07.23]Like, move your head!
[203:08.55]And you're like gonna swing, like, to the, like, way to the left of, like, of his desk, and be like, got it!
[203:13.50]And he's gonna be so freaked out, and like, he's gonna really slyly grab that dead, dead fly, put it in your hand.
[203:18.18]Hold the dead fly in front of him, like, a little slight of hand, and be like, excuse me, sir.
[203:22.35]Any questions?
[203:23.41]And he's gonna be so fucking impressed, he's gonna be like, holy shit.
[203:29.20]And you're gonna get the job in less than 10 minutes you're gonna get that job.
[203:37.88]So this works especially if you're applying to like a karate studio.
[203:44.48]Or any type of other martial arts studio.
[203:47.78]That's the best way to get the job.
[203:54.51]You might get charged with...
[203:57.05]No, no, no, no.
[203:58.86]This is, I don't, I don't give financial advice, okay?
[204:01.28]There's risks in every investment.
[204:04.26]I'm not a financial advisor.
[204:05.50]This is just purely my made-up, fucked-up, dumb opinion of a joke.
[204:13.05]I don't do that, by the way.
[204:14.53]You didn't hear that from me.
[204:16.17]It's bad.
[204:16.67]Don't try this.
[204:17.23]Don't try that at home.
[204:19.73]I'm still on Hero TV.
[204:21.29]Wait, what?
[204:22.76]Why am I on Hero TV still?
[204:26.20]They haven't turned me off?
[204:31.99]Well, alright.
[204:36.55]Thank you, though, Sam.
[204:39.13]Thank you, Zafandu, for the $5.75.
[204:40.93]Told my mom about the $30 I gave you the other day, and she said it was not okay that you gave me $30 before.
[204:47.46]So why are you giving me $5.75?
[204:49.78]What's with this $5.75? $5.75.
[204:59.28]Don't get in any trouble.
[205:02.34]So what happens when my stream turns off?
[205:04.38]Hold on a second, wait a minute.
[205:06.56]Is every time I fucking stream on twitch.tv, am I gonna get like re-streamed onto hero.TV?
[205:13.72]If that happens, I'm going to unlink as fast as I possibly fucking can.
[205:22.47]So what, I just re-stream there every time?
[205:26.21]No way.
[205:28.82]Holy shit.
[205:31.20]Okay, yeah.
[205:32.92]That's some, like, parasitic bullshit.
[205:41.33]No, you're fine.
[205:41.81]Okay, alright, alright.
[205:43.99]I think it's only when you play SM.
[205:45.63]How would it know?
[205:46.17]Disconnect.
[205:56.15]Disconnect.
[205:56.85]Disconnect.
[206:00.45]No.
[206:00.69]If that's not the case, then I don't care.
[206:02.03]But if that is the case, that's kind of messed up.
[206:08.05]Oh, it's tagged.
[206:08.69]I get it.

[214:15.75]Topac.
[214:16.29]Yes, yes, yes.
[214:17.29]Topac.
[214:19.81]Let's talk about this because now we're at the end of the stream.
[214:22.74]Thank you, Charlie Cobb Salad.
[214:24.32]My career as a chef is ruined now.
[214:25.98]I hate Caesar salad.
[214:26.86]I love Cobb salad.
[214:28.88]Tope!
[214:29.46]Thank you, Charlie.
[214:31.40]Just go for your dream.
[214:32.50]Be a fucking chef.
[214:33.82]Be a salad chef.
[214:36.64]Topac right now came with $5 and says, Ethereum.
[214:40.43]My Ethereum from yesterday finally made it through Coinbase.
[214:43.05]We need a bald coin wire transfers.
[214:46.63]Here's the part that I told you I was going to talk about here.
[214:51.81]So, as a lot of you know, I don't do PayPal.
[214:58.77]And a lot of people tell me, they say, I wish you did something else besides bits because I don't necessarily like, you know, paying to Twitch that like 20% sometimes and do PayPal.
[215:12.26]Where's the pay?
[215:12.62]Where's the donation button?
[215:13.42]Where's the donation button?
[215:15.72]And I'm like, part of this is like, it's caving, but it's not, I don't know if I would call it caving because it's different.
[215:23.89]So, uh, at this point right now, uh, let me just make sure.
[215:28.90]So before I say, before I like just mentioned this, let me just see if this is like, uh, cause I know that there was like an issue with my like wallet earlier.
[215:44.35]I want to make sure it's like, okay now, but I have an Ethereum address.
[215:51.32]and it's in the bottom of the stream channel this is just like a different avenue if you understand like how cryptocurrency works that if you want to use it you can that's just my ethereum address just if you want to send ether through there you can it's just an alternative avenue it's not like oh by the way I'm turning everything off send me cryptocurrency learn how to use it no
[216:20.75]It's just another alternative avenue if you feel like using it.
[216:25.18]The one thing, though, that you have to remember about this is do not... Like, I don't want people to be like, oh, shit, I'm going to start, like, mining Ethereum now to send to Jerma.
[216:34.66]No, just if you know how it works, if you want to send it, go for it.
[216:42.85]Track all my drug buying through the ledger.
[216:49.59]what's your dogecoin address going off the grid no I just figured it was like an interesting way to go about doing it just if I'm not going to do paypal and people ask me to do paypal all the time it's um it's just kind of there I don't expect anybody to really use it it's just I'm just currently interested in crypto it's something that I like think is interesting
[217:14.92]If you have no idea what that is, don't even worry about it.
[217:17.12]Everything else is going to stay exactly the same.
[217:19.26]But if you do decide to do it, your name's not going to show up on stream.
[217:26.20]It's not like bits where a message will pop up in my stream labs.
[217:31.01]If you do understand it and you do send it, then just send me a message on Twitch.
[217:37.27]Just PM me with the address you came from so I can know who sent it and keep track of it.
[217:43.67]And this is just... I'm just kind of fucking around with this for maybe like a month or so.
[217:49.13]And we'll see if it's something I want to keep doing.
[217:50.95]There's also like the Patreon stuff that like... I'll probably just transition to that completely.
[217:57.02]And like not do this anymore.
[217:59.72]But there you go.
[218:00.64]It was just an interesting little thing.
[218:06.46]So don't worry.
[218:06.94]Patreon is still... Yeah, that is still happening.
[218:11.37]Doesn't that defeat the purpose of crypto?
[218:14.71]Maybe.
[218:18.12]But, again, I want to reiterate this one more time.
[218:21.28]That's only there, like, for fun.
[218:24.10]Like, it's not... Okay, everybody.
[218:27.40]Do you understand cryptocurrencies?
[218:29.80]Oh, you don't.
[218:30.37]Well, please go watch, like, four hours of tutorials to make sure you don't fuck up and send it to the wrong address.
[218:35.73]No, it's just there.
[218:36.39]That won't be a broken record.
[218:41.19]Just... It's just there.
[218:44.27]And with that, for fun, what butler gave $10 here at the very end?
[218:49.95]Live, laugh, chunk.
[218:52.84]What does that mean?
[218:54.32]Thank you.
