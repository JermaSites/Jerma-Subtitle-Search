[05:08.73]Nobody gives a shit about the intro, okay?
[05:14.01]You should only care about now, like right now.
[05:17.16]The stream just started.
[05:20.13]Uh, Monster Rancher 2, we've been using a save file.
[05:23.52]We were using Fenric's save file, which is the legendcup.com.
[05:29.70]We've been using it for everything.
[05:31.19]Tons of resources, tons of stuff.
[05:33.45]And the save file has been amazing and unlocked everything.
[05:35.31]We wouldn't be able to do this without that save file.
[05:37.39]Something that we figured out, uh, Criken and I tested this, uh, yesterday and the day before.
[05:45.16]Uh, because we all have the same save file,
[05:49.58]we were overwriting each other's uploads and even if we change the name the save slots reinstalling redoing it the whole thing the bed last night and I'm talking about the bed I was sitting here at like six o'clock in the afternoon going like oh what do I do I was trying to port monsters I was like dude I downloaded cheat engine and I'm like how do I do this how do I fix this how do I fix this uh

[08:46.96]Where am I?
[08:49.15]What are we doing?
[08:51.31]You don't cut me off when I'm doing the intro for the tournament.
[08:55.39]Remember, that's actually really uncalled for that you just cut me off.
[09:01.26]Okay, I apologize.
[09:02.25]Do it again.
[09:06.48]Ladies and gentlemen, here is the group of boys that are here.
[09:12.31]Hello?
[09:13.36]Poke, what's up?
[09:14.92]Yo.
[09:15.92]By the way, Poke did his homework.
[09:17.64]I see people in the chat like, oh, dude, did Poke even do it?
[09:21.51]Poke did it.
[09:22.03]Poke was way, Poke was on time.
[09:24.43]Poke was incredibly on time.
[09:26.47]I don't like to see that.
[09:27.26]Oh, man, Poke probably didn't make monsters.
[09:30.10]Poke is perfectly fine.
[09:31.36]He's got good monsters.
[09:32.28]I've seen them.
[09:32.78]They're fucking legit.
[09:34.59]I've been reading your chat the whole time.
[09:35.79]No one said that, but okay.
[09:42.03]Hey, what's up?
[09:43.45]How's everybody doing?
[09:44.12]You guys feel good?
[09:46.50]Feeling good.
[09:47.36]Oh, yeah.
[09:49.26]Can I get each of you... Hey, what's up?
[09:51.62]Can I get each of you to give a quick... This is me speaking.
[09:56.03]One, two, three.
[09:58.43]Hey, what's up, everybody?
[09:59.21]This is Poke here.
[10:01.29]Good.
[10:01.65]One, two, three.
[10:03.01]This is an example of speaks.
[10:05.33]Good.
[10:06.12]I like it.
[10:07.68]Hi, it's Squeaks.
[10:08.56]One, two, three.
[10:09.64]Am I too loud?
[10:10.86]No, that's what I'm making sure right now.
[10:14.69]Vinny, hello.
[10:15.97]Hi, I'm Vinny.
[10:17.49]Very cool.
[10:19.05]And where is... Oh, we got to give Criken the thumbs up.
[10:22.63]He's like, can I unmute?
[10:25.18]No.
[10:25.26]Criken?
[10:35.45]Criken?
[10:37.65]Criken?
[10:38.99]Criken?
[10:43.10]I think he's live.
[10:43.91]Alright.
[10:44.15]Well, hey, this is Criken.
[10:45.67]One, two, three.
[10:48.84]That's him.
[10:49.88]Yeah, that's a good volume.
[10:51.41]Thanks, everybody, for coming.
[10:52.67]This is probably not going to be too long, but it is going to be fun.
[10:55.80]So there's a few ways we can do this.
[11:00.92]It's up to how you guys think that we should go about the intro here.
[11:05.17]Do you guys want to play your songs and talk about why you chose them?
[11:10.96]Are we going to have like a whole emotional breakdown for like 40 minutes?
[11:13.80]Or do you just want to roll with it and just say what the song was?
[11:20.35]I think as streamers, we may want to, you know, not have the songs played personally.
[11:25.60]That's my choice personally.
[11:27.02]Yeah.
[11:28.13]yeah I think we just sing it ourselves a little bit you know okay that works so just say what it was uh I am I'm currently sharing on Discord right now so you all should be able to see what's on my screen yep and I'm going to show chat something else here
[11:49.91]Here is how we're going to do it.
[11:52.44]You guys can't see this, but what I'm going to have is I'm going to have my mods take screenshots of this after every couple of matches so you can have updated bracket.
[11:59.81]Here is everybody in the tournament.
[12:01.29]We're going to do round robin style.
[12:03.69]And I just learned... You're covering it.
[12:07.10]You can see.
[12:07.64]It's fine.
[12:08.80]I can't.
[12:10.02]No, you can.
[12:10.58]Look.
[12:14.75]So with that being said...
[12:17.91]We don't have to like leave the call.
[12:19.09]Like everybody can just chill.
[12:20.23]You're covering it again.
[12:21.15]Okay.
[12:21.63]Stop it.
[12:22.69]You're just messing with me.
[12:23.87]Okay.
[12:26.00]Nobody has to leave.
[12:26.80]I think we could just kind of all hang out here unmuted and just talk.
[12:29.74]There's only six of us.
[12:30.62]So it's not like there's like a hundred of us.
[12:34.78]So the people that are going first will be Criken.
[12:39.45]Well, there's no music.
[12:40.41]This is weird.
[12:41.47]Hold on.
[12:43.21]I hear music.
[12:44.51]There we go.
[12:46.71]So the people that are going first will be Criken and Squeaks.
[12:51.32]And what I would like everybody to do, this is bracket number one, I would like for you to say, put in the chat, what monster you want in this bracket.
[13:00.81]Because once you choose that monster, you cannot change it for this bracket.
[13:05.69]Oh.
[13:06.62]So this is going blind pick.
[13:09.88]How does the... So we have three monsters to put in.
[13:15.89]Yeah, we'll be doing multiple brackets.
[13:18.07]So you have to decide who you want to go with this bracket.
[13:23.34]Okay.
[13:25.20]We're going to be doing best two out of three per match because it takes like 10 seconds to do a match.
[13:31.65]And this whole tournament will be over in 30 minutes if we don't.
[13:39.78]Sounds good.
[13:40.56]okay okay so uh please let me know in the chat here and once you say who this who you're using you are locked in by the way once you type that in that's it it's over spoiler the pick so you don't get counter picked
[14:03.12]Oh shit.
[14:03.76]Wait, I have to delete it.
[14:05.55]Oh shit.
[14:06.17]I didn't even think about that.
[14:08.07]I have to say who I'm picking.
[14:09.87]Chat, who the fuck do I pick?
[14:11.61]We don't know what anyone else has made.
[14:13.49]We're not going to know what anybody else is picking.
[14:18.38]Who do you think?
[14:19.38]Who should I use?
[14:20.46]I don't know if I want to do that.
[14:22.93]No, I know what I'm doing.
[14:26.89]How do you spoiler something in Discord?
[14:28.45]I don't remember how to spoiler something.
[14:30.06]Uh, slash spoiler.
[14:31.98]And then you write your message.
[14:39.97]What the fuck, you idiot!
[14:41.83]You did that!
[14:43.21]I did that and you got me so bad!
[14:45.21]What the fuck, dude!
[14:47.02]It's not that!
[14:48.90]Alright, everybody don't look at mine!
[14:53.98]Wait, highlight it with the eye icon?
[14:56.25]No, no, it doesn't matter.
[14:57.43]You guys don't even know one of these monsters.
[14:59.37]This is all our first time using Discord, clearly.
[15:02.37]I still don't know how to spoiler something on Discord.
[15:04.96]Wait, slash?
[15:05.94]Oh, you have to... I typed slash spoiler.
[15:09.42]You liar.
[15:12.77]Jeremiah, your Discord is fucked up.
[15:16.27]What the hell?
[15:17.41]Slash spoiler works.
[15:18.90]So, everybody good?
[15:20.82]Yes.
[15:21.82]Whatever.
[15:22.36]Okay.
[15:22.78]We're all locked in.
[15:24.14]Oh, wait.
[15:24.62]Am I typing something?
[15:25.32]Oh, yeah.
[15:25.70]Poke, who are you using?
[15:26.88]Who are you using?
[15:28.97]Oh.
[15:29.85]Wait.
[15:30.01]I'm doing a two?
[15:31.23]Oh.
[15:31.61]Yeah.
[15:31.79]Everybody has to pick because we're all in the bracket.
[15:36.96]Alright.
[15:37.34]Okay.
[15:37.82]Alright.
[15:38.50]Alright.
[15:38.74]Poke, lock it in.
[15:39.36]Who are you doing?
[15:40.60]Okay.
[15:40.82]I'm typing it.
[15:47.51]This is so embarrassing.
[15:48.43]Alright.
[15:48.71]Let's go.
[15:49.72]This is... Man.
[15:52.41]Alright, ladies and gentlemen, your first match is Kryken versus Squeaks.
[15:57.75]And this is going to be... Let me pull it up.
[16:04.14]Jelociraptor versus Brokeboy.
[16:09.59]Wait.
[16:10.79]Can you two explain to me what the history behind those songs or the history behind why I used them is while I set it up?
[16:17.16]Oh, Jerma, I believe Squeaks' monster is Sexy Minion.
[16:21.83]Yeah, Brokeboy is not my monster.
[16:24.14]I was wondering.
[16:26.54]I was like, wait, did I blow the wrong one?
[16:28.81]I thought you were being mean to my monster or something.
[16:32.11]Brokeboy!
[16:33.96]He works hard, but you don't have to go so hard.
[16:38.68]Okay.
[16:39.86]I'm broke boy.
[16:40.66]It's this fucking music, man.
[16:42.34]This Monster Rancher music just invades your brain.
[16:46.25]The fucking town music when you first start.
[16:48.27]Oh, my God.
[16:49.35]Alright.
[16:50.23]So Criken versus Squeaks.
[16:51.93]This is sexy minion versus Jalassa Raptor.
[16:58.44]Sounds good.
[16:59.02]No broke boy.
[17:00.12]Not yet.
[17:00.78]You're coming up next.
[17:03.66]Okay.
[17:05.89]Here we go.
[17:08.41]Thank you.
[17:09.63]Everybody can see what I'm doing, right?
[17:12.21]Yeah.
[17:13.15]What songs were they, guys?
[17:14.84]I'm curious.
[17:15.28]Yeah.
[17:15.60]What's the why?
[17:16.58]What's the albums?
[17:18.52]Yeah.
[17:18.80]Jalossaraptor is the album Wildflower by the Avalanches, which is one of my favorite artists.
[17:25.79]And I love that album.
[17:27.75]And when it came out, I decided to name it Jalossaraptor for obvious reasons.
[17:33.11]This was the first one I trained, so.
[17:37.55]Alright.
[17:38.41]Let me just go ahead and put these up.
[17:40.92]Oh, my God.
[17:41.86]How about Sexy Minion?
[17:42.88]What album is that?
[17:43.82]I'm curious, too.
[17:45.16]It's Linkin Park Hybrid Theory.
[17:47.80]I had that on CD.
[17:49.98]Hell yeah.
[17:50.78]Yeah, me too.
[17:51.81]That's one of my earliest CDs.
[17:54.31]So it has a fond place in my heart.
[17:57.01]So then it spawned a Sexy Minion, I guess.
[18:00.47]Obviously.
[18:01.79]Alright.
[18:02.80]Can I just go over something real quick before we start?
[18:06.76]You guys, we are not beating the allegations on what drugs everybody used, because you all got the same fucking life, power, and defense bars.
[18:15.90]You're all drug users.
[18:17.62]I'm drug free, by the way.
[18:19.06]None of my monsters took drugs.
[18:20.38]Totally, completely natural.
[18:22.31]Oh.
[18:24.41]I hope that works out for you.
[18:26.23]What if you took on a more managerial role?
[18:31.20]Don't ignore me.
[18:32.24]What do you mean?
[18:33.14]Go ahead, guys.
[18:33.64]Fight.
[18:35.17]Alright, you guys ready?
[18:36.21]This is the four doing best two out of three here.
[18:38.17]This is Criken versus Squeaks.
[18:40.95]What song is better?
[18:42.57]We're going to really find out right now.
[18:44.66]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
[18:46.94]The tournament now begins.
[18:49.30]You guys good?
[18:50.46]Yeah, I'm ready.
[18:54.39]What did you do to this guy?
[18:57.53]Why does this guy have like 2,000 stats?
[18:59.31]Is that a centaur?
[19:02.42]It's a sexy minion.
[19:03.90]Yeah, I didn't realize he was a centaur.
[19:06.02]He's pretty sexy.
[19:07.51]Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[19:09.31]Accurate name.
[19:09.81]Yeah, a lot of drugs.
[19:11.39]Alright.
[19:11.61]A lot of drugs.
[19:12.41]Well, Jaloss Raptor's got the life advantage here and the defense advantage.
[19:17.26]Remember, monsters can just be morons and not do anything.
[19:20.79]So, but the speed, you got it.
[19:23.33]I don't know.
[19:23.79]The sexy minion is going to be difficult.
[19:26.21]Yeah.
[19:27.21]Alright.
[19:27.74]Good luck, you two.
[19:29.44]Begin.
[19:29.64]Begin.
[19:34.30]Alright, off the bat, is that it?
[19:36.26]What the fuck was that?
[19:39.06]Let's go.
[19:39.86]What the fuck was that?
[19:41.93]You killed him.
[19:43.01]That was one second.
[19:46.03]For two years?
[19:46.91]To die like this?
[19:48.36]Two years.
[19:50.50]Lance, what is that?
[19:52.18]Steroids.
[19:54.04]This is going to be the whole tournament.
[19:56.66]I was so scared that you guys weren't going to know how to play the game, so I allowed drugs.
[20:01.04]And it turns out that might not have been a great idea.
[20:05.05]I was afraid.
[20:06.71]Alright, so... He did the fucking FNAF scream when he charged.
[20:09.99]I thought that was like a bug.
[20:13.62]Oh, what the fuck?
[20:15.00]Okay, so, Squeak, sexy minion, congratulations.
[20:18.42]We're going again.
[20:19.96]Remember, two out of three.
[20:21.62]Alright, let's go.
[20:22.86]Let's see what he's got.
[20:24.03]You got this, Criken.
[20:25.23]I just gotta avoid that first charge.
[20:27.01]That deadly first charge.
[20:28.91]If you do that, you win.
[20:29.80]You could just, like, basically... Any attack's gonna kill me in one hit.
[20:34.42]It's whoever attacks first wins.
[20:36.63]Come on, no one hits.
[20:37.55]Oh!
[20:38.05]Here we go!
[20:39.45]No!
[20:40.29]Oh my god.
[20:41.38]Get in there.
[20:43.54]Ow!
[20:44.02]He's still alive.
[20:47.00]Oh!
[20:47.45]Why does he get a weapon?
[20:50.45]Yes, go.
[20:51.37]Wait, don't ask these questions.
[20:52.25]No, big dodge.
[20:53.20]Whoa, what a dodge.
[20:55.66]No.
[20:56.02]He doesn't know what to do.
[20:56.70]Do something.
[20:58.36]My God.
[20:59.38]Run the time, sexy minion.
[21:02.39]He's still alive.
[21:04.49]My God.
[21:06.17]Jello's gonna one shot.
[21:08.90]Huge dodge.
[21:11.26]Come on, one shot.
[21:12.50]Do something.
[21:14.28]oh my god what oh my god no wait oh my god sexy minions oh I can't believe it
[21:31.56]Oh my god.
[21:33.64]Can you explain what grit is?
[21:35.28]What is the grit effect?
[21:36.72]How does that happen?
[21:37.79]Some monsters can effectively have a cheat death mechanic where their certain breed or whatever can come back to life.
[21:47.12]And I guess sexy minion is that.
[21:48.56]So Squeaks, congratulations.
[21:50.56]Thank you so much.
[21:51.24]You looked up the guide.
[21:53.96]You googled Reddit.
[21:57.27]Yes, I googled Reddit.
[21:59.59]There is your first match here.
[22:03.07]Oh, I'm so honored.
[22:05.93]That was awesome.
[22:06.76]Squeaks, congratulations.
[22:08.54]Thank you so much.
[22:09.66]That is one win for Squeaks.
[22:12.94]So here's the thing.
[22:13.56]Should I mark?
[22:15.44]I don't think I'm going to mark KOs because every single match is going to end in a KO.
[22:20.07]Let's be honest.
[22:20.67]I don't think anything's going to time out.
[22:23.09]None of these will time out.
[22:25.77]But what if one does?
[22:28.51]I mean, that could be the tiebreaker, like, if it times out.
[22:31.52]Oh, there you go.
[22:32.20]You can see it here.
[22:34.82]Alright, let's do it.
[22:35.50]Let's keep going.
[22:36.24]So now it's, uh, Poke, it's Poke, it's you versus me here now.
[22:40.21]Oh, no.
[22:41.61]Oh, me and Star are fighting.
[22:43.13]Okay.
[22:43.75]Yep.
[22:44.35]It's, uh, Poke, it's me and you.
[22:45.53]Just like usual.
[22:46.64]How much drugs have you done?
[22:47.56]I've done no drugs.
[22:49.06]Poke, oh, we might have the only drug-free match.
[22:53.99]I never, I didn't know how to use those pots.
[22:58.21]Pot Surge is drugs.
[23:00.16]Yeah, I'm on a strict nuts and mint leaf diet.
[23:03.70]Yes.
[23:04.44]So you're natural too.
[23:05.64]Alright.
[23:06.07]I feel it.
[23:07.29]Good.
[23:10.13]Is Toron or whatever considered a drug?
[23:13.46]Yeah.
[23:15.20]Okay.
[23:15.32]And then I'm using Yermit.
[23:18.51]I figured that was a good balanced monster to use.
[23:21.78]Is he a frog?
[23:24.18]I was hoping it was going to be a frog, but unfortunately it's a dinosaur.
[23:26.80]How did you get my monster?
[23:28.49]There's a code for each thing?
[23:30.93]Yeah, I have magical powers, Poke.
[23:35.53]That's crazy.
[23:36.45]Crazy.

[25:39.85]That's all I did.
[25:42.10]You did defense.
[25:42.92]I did only life on this guy.
[25:45.10]Look at my speed.
[25:47.40]That's bad.
[25:48.33]Oh, no.

[25:52.95]He's got two moves.
[25:55.46]Big dodge coming up.
[25:57.12]That's okay.
[25:57.50]Oh, my God.
[25:58.20]This is going to go to time.
[26:00.67]Why am I so mean?
[26:01.65]This is going to be a long fight.
[26:03.37]Yeah.
[26:05.12]Oh!
[26:06.30]Good job, man!

[26:11.01]Come on!
[26:11.53]Song's about rainbows.
[26:14.67]Oh, my defense is good, though.
[26:15.83]You gotta hit him harder than that.
[26:18.30]Oh, my defense is good.
[26:19.74]Oh, no, no, no.
[26:22.96]Big jumping claw.
[26:23.73]Come on.
[26:24.05]Oh, what a dodge.
[26:26.21]Why are you going so many times?
[26:28.79]Dodge it.
[26:29.79]Big.
[26:32.54]He's just spamming two moves.
[26:35.61]He can't decide.
[26:39.20]He takes no damage.
[26:40.26]He takes no damage.
[26:42.44]Yeah, why won't your guy do anything?
[26:44.67]He just felt like a punching bag.
[26:46.91]Come on, do something.
[26:48.11]Can he crit?
[26:48.79]Can my guy crit?
[26:49.71]Yeah.
[26:50.09]He could.
[26:51.56]Oh, shit.
[26:52.52]Oh, take a big bite.
[26:54.38]Time.
[26:54.58]Wait.
[26:55.52]No.
[26:55.76]Who has more health?
[26:57.36]Broke boy wins, I think.
[27:00.05]Oh.
[27:00.57]Yermit won.
[27:00.81]Oh, Yermit wins.
[27:03.03]Alright, we go again.
[27:03.97]Like 3%.
[27:05.13]Man, that was close.
[27:06.03]That was close.
[27:07.23]Damn, okay.
[27:08.17]That was a good one.
[27:09.48]Is this what life is like without drugs?
[27:13.44]Yeah, no one dies.
[27:14.57]None of these two died.
[27:15.97]Alright, this is big poke.
[27:16.95]This is big.
[27:20.38]I'm going again.
[27:23.50]The other fight was so crazy.
[27:25.29]If you... This is like the Little League.
[27:35.25]Oh, he's angry.
[27:37.13]Big bite.
[27:39.19]Eat him like some chips!
[27:41.18]Eat him like some chips!
[27:42.38]Eat him like some chips!
[27:45.24]Shit, come on.
[27:47.44]Don't use all your mana, all your guts.
[27:49.43]Remember how much you swam for this, broke boy?
[27:52.95]How much you pulled?
[27:57.51]Uh-oh.
[28:00.92]He's got other rolls, but he likes the bite.
[28:03.22]That was a big bit.
[28:03.98]Like some chips!
[28:04.36]Like some chips!
[28:04.98]I feel like he can combo the bite.
[28:06.91]Yeah.
[28:07.25]He never goes for one.
[28:09.67]Well, you never go for one bite, you know?
[28:11.33]He's got nothing in that third slot, though.
[28:13.96]Fuck.
[28:16.82]Big.
[28:17.36]Oh.
[28:19.08]Oh, that was weak.
[28:20.95]Wait, I think I have more health, right?
[28:22.27]I think I got more health.
[28:24.21]Shit!
[28:24.41]Yes!
[28:25.57]Oh, that's a big bite.
[28:26.79]Yes!
[28:27.82]Oh, the time scram.
[28:29.28]Time scram.
[28:31.07]Uh-oh.
[28:31.35]It's me.
[28:33.61]Shit.
[28:33.94]Okay.
[28:34.42]And now... Oh, the tiebreaker.
[28:38.50]Alright.
[28:38.72]Good match so far.
[28:39.44]Good match.
[28:40.42]I got to get away from that bike.
[28:42.16]Brokeboy, do something crazy this round.
[28:43.66]Do like a... Explode.
[28:46.83]Come on.
[28:47.01]Does Brokeboy only have two moves?
[28:49.29]Yeah.
[28:49.69]He never been to war.
[28:52.17]I never said that.
[28:53.73]Two moves.
[28:53.95]But it's working somehow.
[28:55.58]Oh, he's got three.
[28:56.12]Did he evolve into like a butterfly already?
[28:59.50]I mean...
[29:00.79]Yeah, he never evolved.
[29:02.35]Oh, that was a crit.
[29:03.31]Oh, a crit.
[29:03.79]Oh my god.
[29:04.39]Alright, it's your turn to crit.
[29:06.25]Come on, rogue boy.
[29:07.74]Break him.
[29:08.28]Bite chain.
[29:09.34]Break him.
[29:09.76]Oh, there's one.
[29:11.32]Oh, he's doing the chain.
[29:12.42]What is he doing?
[29:13.34]He's like dancing.
[29:15.16]He's bugging out, dude.
[29:16.14]This is a new deck right here.
[29:18.55]Look at that.
[29:21.81]Again, again.
[29:23.51]Oh, no.
[29:25.53]Yes.
[29:25.97]Oh.
[29:27.91]No, we can't end like this.
[29:29.63]No, we can't end like this.
[29:31.51]Come on.
[29:34.58]He's only used Spite Attack.
[29:39.02]He won't do anything else.
[29:40.91]What if it's like... Oh.
[29:45.59]Unless he pulls something out here.
[29:46.65]No, that's a big hit.
[29:48.36]Oh, what a hit.
[29:50.82]Looks like it's going to be wrapped up here in two, one...
[29:54.22]no oh that's nice so amazing that keeps us stargazing all these broke boys I don't know hey don't worry I'm gonna get killed in one hit by the next person that I fight because they're all drug users dude my other guy might do drugs you'll see wait did any of you guys have your monsters die
[30:22.57]No, wait, some of you guys didn't even make it to two years, right?
[30:26.59]Yeah, I had to reload my save.
[30:28.81]One of my monsters kept dying.
[30:31.14]I didn't realize, maybe drugs?
[30:33.04]I don't know why.
[30:33.74]Drugs take time off its life.
[30:36.40]Ten weeks off of life, every drug.
[30:38.44]One of mine is literally a week from death.
[30:40.69]It sent me three warning messages that it's going to die if I don't put it on ice, and it made it to its second birthday, and I immediately froze it, and it's not going to live a day after that.
[30:52.23]I'm sad, I should have taken some drugs.
[30:56.76]Yeah, now that I'm looking back, seeing my stats versus everybody else's, I should have went hard on the drugs too.
[31:03.61]Everybody just did that power defense life drug.
[31:07.30]You're all droided out like crazy.
[31:10.32]what happened to this moral grandstanding you were just doing it was just because you didn't see what else was doing it once you lose you realize I should have been doing drugs my whole life alright uh Ster when I was six Ster who was your monster who'd you pick here uh I picked yermit 2.0 oh so now
[31:29.86]Yeah, the song that I chose was all of the songs that are not Rainbow Connection combined into one to defeat Yermit.
[31:38.38]Oh, that's the anti-Yermit.
[31:39.66]And what album did you choose?
[31:43.79]Clap Clap Liquid Portraits is the real generation.
[31:48.94]You have a thousand power.
[31:50.84]Oh my god.
[31:51.46]You have one thousand power.
[31:54.10]Yeah.
[31:55.58]It's a dragon, too.
[31:56.86]You got a dragon pole?
[31:58.06]That is Yermit 2.0.
[32:01.41]And Vinny, who did you use?
[32:04.09]Oh, no.
[32:05.27]Champ.
[32:06.05]Champ.
[32:08.12]Champ.
[32:09.82]And that's Beatles' White Album.
[32:14.35]Specifically, my favorite songs, Wild Honey Pie and Revolution No.
[32:18.19]9.
[32:19.02]And if you know the album, you know those two songs are shit.
[32:21.96]So those are the ones that I'm going to say here.
[32:26.70]This could go pretty honestly.
[32:29.37]Look at that.
[32:34.81]Well, like I said, I took a more managerial role to my character.
[32:40.88]What do you mean managerial?
[32:43.35]Like you managed the character.
[32:44.59]Yeah, I managed.
[32:46.78]I managed the character becoming strong.
[32:49.76]Yeah.
[32:50.48]Okay.
[32:51.44]That's fine.
[32:51.88]There's some rumors floating around.
[32:53.85]Rumors of what?
[32:55.43]I heard some rumors on... I was Googling Reddit and it was saying that Vinny didn't even train this.
[33:00.61]Vinny didn't train this is the rumor.
[33:02.48]There's a video of me training.
[33:04.06]I almost killed my monsters several times.
[33:06.90]They were dying because I kept overextending it, overexerting it.
[33:09.56]It says you have seven minutes on Steam.
[33:11.71]Yeah.
[33:14.74]what do you mean he's lying does it actually say that no I played it for over an hour over an hour dude what alright oh no I mean I played many hours
[33:33.08]Fuck you for having a monster this crazy.
[33:36.09]Honestly.
[33:36.75]I can't even see the number of the power.
[33:39.40]That's too much power.
[33:40.84]So what did you do to have this happen?
[33:44.49]Tren.
[33:46.43]Tren?
[33:47.77]Yeah.
[33:48.42]If you know, you know.
[33:49.54]Good luck.
[33:50.96]Look at the little wings.
[33:53.81]He's confused!
[33:54.93]He's confused!
[33:56.51]He's confused!
[33:59.53]He forgot what he was doing there.
[34:08.44]Dude, imagine getting stabbed by water.
[34:14.03]I know, repeatedly.
[34:18.20]Oh, shit.
[34:19.34]Okay, well he was pretty dumb at the beginning, but that ended pretty badly.
[34:24.30]It's the roids.
[34:26.06]They go to the brain.
[34:26.99]You can't really think very good.
[34:29.23]I have two monsters I trained.
[34:30.67]I trained this one.
[34:31.45]I was super mean to him.
[34:32.72]And the other one, I made him watch me be nice to the other monster.
[34:36.60]Okay.
[34:39.35]So he is a tormented beast.
[34:41.86]He is a vile creature.
[34:43.78]My guy's water.
[34:45.46]Vinny, seriously, you almost had it.
[34:47.10]Literally right there.
[34:47.80]That was pretty much it.
[34:48.76]I believe in Champ.
[34:49.88]It could happen.
[34:50.53]I believe in Vinny's here, yeah.
[34:52.05]I like that.
[34:52.71]That looked good.
[34:53.53]That looked pretty good.
[34:54.57]It could be good.
[34:55.87]You know, Champ's got it.
[34:57.23]I think his strategy has to be stab faster.
[34:59.90]His one weakness is I accidentally taught this shithead fireball and it's an int attack and it doesn't do anything.
[35:07.04]Oh, that's not good.
[35:08.14]Oh, I see.
[35:08.90]He uses it.
[35:10.11]Here we go.
[35:10.81]Good luck.
[35:13.47]Fire versus water.
[35:15.97]That was cool looking though.
[35:21.14]We need more of that.
[35:22.54]Oh my God.
[35:24.00]Suffocation.
[35:26.15]Oh.
[35:27.21]Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[35:29.63]That's it.
[35:30.67]He's done.
[35:32.00]Champ, you're an idiot.
[35:32.48]Champ, you fucking moron.
[35:34.84]I am honestly glad he is dead.
[35:38.20]He gets more rounds.
[35:41.29]Champ drowned.
[35:43.05]Ster takes that one.
[35:44.57]I spent so long overseeing the training.
[35:50.54]That was fucked up.
[35:52.40]That was so mean.
[35:53.58]Poor champ.
[35:56.95]Damn it.
[35:57.13]Congratulations, Stero, on your first win here.
[36:00.07]Woo.
[36:01.15]Now, because it's round robin, now we go kriken to me.
[36:06.96]Oh, fuck.
[36:09.68]That's cool.
[36:11.08]I'm going to get crushed.
[36:13.97]okay uh so we go here alright so uh you're gonna kill me in one hit unless I can just dodge which is definitely not so much more health than any of us because you haven't doped it all away like we have that's true you may say yeah you may live longer we'll find out I'll show the standings after this because once I get through the second round
[36:40.60]Is the life going to save me if you do 500 damage a hit, though?
[36:43.14]I don't think so.
[36:45.92]I'm just looking at that stat total, and it's so wildly unbalanced for every single person.
[36:51.15]It's so all over the place.
[36:53.81]So far, it's been whoever has the most power wins, right?
[36:56.96]Has there ever been an exception?
[36:58.56]Effectively, that is what's been going on, yeah.
[37:01.50]Yeah.
[37:02.79]I think speed is important, right?
[37:05.17]Yeah, speed is important.
[37:09.08]It's that the only drug is the power booster.
[37:13.11]You can't do that with anything else.
[37:18.13]I'm concerned about your skill versus my speed, even though I have a decent amount of speed.
[37:26.59]I mean, I like your little flower crown.
[37:30.11]This defense too.
[37:31.35]Shit, dude.
[37:32.89]Okay, we both have raptors.
[37:34.90]Yours is just way stronger.
[37:39.17]You're healthier, though.
[37:40.07]You're going to live a much longer life after this tournament.
[37:45.10]Let's go.
[37:46.12]We'll see.
[37:51.74]Yes.
[37:53.55]Whoa.
[37:54.43]Roll salt is big.
[37:59.01]Oh, my God.
[38:01.75]Alright.
[38:02.84]Just a few hundred of those.
[38:03.96]Call it.
[38:04.62]Call it.
[38:05.92]Collusion.
[38:07.68]Oh, boy.
[38:09.88]Sorry, Yermit.
[38:11.33]You can go to time.
[38:12.39]You can go to time.
[38:14.61]Oh, that's it.
[38:16.83]Oh.
[38:18.09]Dang it.
[38:20.30]Yermit, you got to do drugs next time, man.
[38:23.08]I know.
[38:24.20]Everyone's doing them.
[38:24.82]You're missing out, dude.
[38:25.69]This is great over here.
[38:28.33]Everyone's doing them, man.
[38:29.67]Come on.
[38:30.23]I can tell you where to get them.
[38:33.14]Yeah, my personal life is in shambles.
[38:36.87]alright your monster is dead before walking out of this arena Ster seriously like that that's the one saving grace about this tournament is all these monsters are ready to collapse yeah at any point and all of our monsters hate hate our like they're oh they they all want us
[38:56.92]Mine developed a taste for the drugs and then it started asking for it.
[39:00.22]And it really is true.
[39:02.52]It was this really negative feedback loop sort of thing that was going on.
[39:06.49]You'll see him later.
[39:07.27]Don't worry.
[39:07.83]That's I'm saving him for the end.
[39:09.64]Alright, well, let's just watch me get destroyed.
[39:17.79]Why do you why are you making him relive this?
[39:20.61]Because it's the rules.
[39:23.93]I mean, pull them out, man.
[39:25.85]If you keep dodging, he's so confused.
[39:30.24]OK.
[39:31.06]Oh, my God.
[39:33.22]There is a chance.
[39:34.95]Yes, it's a chance.
[39:36.07]OK.
[39:37.61]All attacks and take the time.
[39:39.73]Take the time.
[39:41.21]Oh, my.
[39:44.16]One roll.
[39:44.44]So he's like a 5% chance.
[39:46.42]There's a 5% chance.
[39:49.02]Oh.
[39:50.36]OK.
[39:51.98]Oh!
[39:52.46]I mean, you're a McBeliever.
[39:53.38]He can do it.
[39:54.54]Doesn't look like Chocolate Connection's doing very good.
[39:58.35]That's not the name of the song.
[40:00.35]There are so many.
[40:05.90]Do something.
[40:07.12]At least he's cool.
[40:08.10]This time out.
[40:09.99]Oh!
[40:11.60]Dude, come on!
[40:13.18]No, he's chipping away!
[40:14.45]Oh!
[40:14.61]Weirdly close.
[40:15.59]Weirdly close, yeah.
[40:17.91]Oh, that was weirdly close.
[40:19.35]Shit.
[40:20.11]Extremely close.
[40:21.55]Holy damn.
[40:23.07]Alright, GG, Criken.
[40:24.52]GG.
[40:25.52]Geloso Raptor's the new Capri Sun flavor.
[40:29.86]The secret world of Alex Mack.
[40:34.22]Alright, let's put it on the board.
[40:35.61]Vinny, can you, uh, corrupt this game?
[40:40.58]I personally don't think I know how to do that, but someone out there could, and then they could send it to me.
[40:45.55]We can fight with corrupted monsters.
[40:47.43]That'd be sick.
[40:49.21]Let's take a look at the standings.
[40:53.50]It's on PS1.
[40:54.38]Yeah, it's PS1.
[40:55.12]The Mugen of Monster Rancher where you get Ryu and everybody in here.
[41:00.19]Dude, they should make more Monster Rancher games, and then people should mod them.
[41:03.72]Yeah, you could have the Horse Girls.
[41:05.68]Did anybody play it in Goku?
[41:07.04]Yeah.
[41:09.13]When was the last Monster Rancher?
[41:12.84]They've made so many.
[41:14.12]Half of them are awful.
[41:15.82]Wait, there's new ones?
[41:17.20]There's Monster Rancher 3, 4, Evo, Monster Rancher Big Battles, Monster Rancher DS Battles.
[41:25.03]I mean, there's like a shitload of them, and half of them are terrible.
[41:27.52]After you get past 3, or after 2, honestly, I think they're all bad.
[41:31.16]I think the new one is not bad.
[41:33.07]I think the new one with the kaijus is cool.
[41:36.43]Oh yeah, the kaiju one was fun.
[41:39.39]Alright, now we got Poke is going against Vinny.
[41:45.78]What?
[41:46.12]Are we using new monsters?
[41:48.64]Nope.
[41:49.24]Same ones.
[41:50.30]Same ones.
[41:51.07]That's for the next bracket.
[41:52.13]We're doing another bracket after this.
[41:53.11]I understand.
[41:54.09]Okay.
[41:55.83]Yeah, he definitely played this game.
[41:58.40]Alrighty.
[41:59.30]Dude, I have 86 minutes in the game.
[42:02.52]Wait, do I pick my other monster?
[42:04.33]Nope.
[42:05.27]Yeah.
[42:05.55]You're you.
[42:07.21]You've locked broke boy for this bracket.
[42:11.44]Oh, for this bracket.
[42:12.54]Yes.
[42:13.04]For this one.
[42:13.50]Okay.
[42:14.42]I broke boy.
[42:14.90]You got this broke boy versus champ, right?
[42:22.29]Yeah.
[42:28.27]Okay.
[42:29.74]Yeah.
[42:31.76]So here we go.
[42:33.98]I'm winning.
[42:35.98]Sorry.
[42:38.04]Sorry, Vinny.
[42:39.16]I don't know.
[42:40.48]Water could stab you.
[42:42.33]Water's sharp.
[42:43.59]Yeah, but I got defense.
[42:44.77]Yeah, the combo stab.
[42:45.87]I think he's going to drink you.
[42:48.97]I'm a shell, dude.
[42:50.23]That's dark.
[42:50.73]I'm a rock.
[42:52.01]I'm looking for a champ.
[42:54.88]An upset on champ.
[42:56.10]I'm looking for a poke sweep right here.
[42:58.96]I think that's going to happen.
[43:00.46]I'm liking the life and the defense.
[43:02.16]Getting one move was strategic so I could spam bite.
[43:04.72]It's a new tech.
[43:07.07]There's discussions on it on the forums.
[43:10.25]Google Reddit to find out.
[43:13.79]Wait, GoogleReddit.com?
[43:16.80]Yeah, just Google Reddit.
[43:19.66]Yeah, that's how you find out your information to get the meta on the game.
[43:23.35]Alright, bite him!
[43:25.37]Whoa!
[43:26.89]What the hell?
[43:28.11]He learned!
[43:29.50]Oh, no.
[43:30.50]Oh, you're drowning.
[43:31.88]Oh, what is happening?
[43:38.03]You're going to pull off the lightning move again.
[43:39.79]Come on, bite him.
[43:41.09]Champ.
[43:41.45]Bite the water.
[43:42.68]Champ.
[43:43.74]Just bite the water.
[43:44.96]Someone do something.
[43:46.58]Why are you doing nothing?
[43:48.48]Oh, big dodge.
[43:49.81]Perfect dodge.
[43:51.99]He's biting his time.
[43:53.15]70% hit chance.
[43:54.03]Bite him!
[43:55.69]Oh, there we go.
[43:58.41]There's the dodge I needed.
[44:01.29]Oh, it's a crit.
[44:04.44]One more hit, champ.
[44:05.48]Come on, you got this.
[44:07.38]Come on.
[44:08.12]You can tell the connection Vinny has with his monster.
[44:12.27]I love my monster.
[44:14.29]What was that move?
[44:15.75]Oh, no.
[44:21.29]Oh, that was bad.
[44:23.25]404 not found.
[44:23.93]You had a 21% chance to hit him.
[44:26.87]In general?
[44:27.73]Yeah.
[44:29.28]In general.
[44:31.34]That was sad.
[44:32.42]I love Champ.
[44:33.54]I'm a big fan.
[44:34.38]You know, I'm a supporter of Champ, and we're friends, and I've trained him.
[44:36.81]What made you come up with the name Champ?
[44:38.83]Yeah.
[44:39.29]Slime Champ.
[44:41.44]It's a bit of a story.
[44:42.94]It was about a slime who did something like a champ years ago.
[44:46.12]It's fun.
[44:51.19]He has 300 speed.
[44:52.57]That's why.
[44:53.41]That's the 300 speed.
[44:54.65]It is a lot of speed, but hey, Poke, don't worry.
[44:57.13]You do that tornado move, you'll knock him out.
[45:00.76]Is that what affects the likeliness of a hit?
[45:03.04]The speed?
[45:03.54]Speed and skill.
[45:06.00]Oh, I should have had... I have no speed.
[45:09.67]Come on!
[45:13.38]EAT HIM!
[45:16.65]No you can't!
[45:22.92]He's doing the locker room whip!
[45:26.94]Movie moment is right here!
[45:32.77]No!
[45:34.59]You just angered everybody in Vegas that was going for a flawless sweep here.
[45:45.85]Wait, so was that the last we see of Brokeboy?
[45:51.00]No.
[45:52.39]he's coming back for round three don't worry broke boy is in this bracket I'm excited to see broke boy again dude he sucks he's fine trying so hard there's nothing wrong with him he's got that cool movie did he get that tornado spin that's cool he's gonna be a non-drug bracket that's all I should have gave him coke
[46:16.51]love how we all randomly rolled like these actual monsters and poke got a worm that nobody knows that I'm funny I thought you guys would laugh at it so I'm happy alright so now we move to I believe we go to here so Ster versus Criken I believe is next
[46:40.83]Oh, OK.
[46:42.67]Yeah, yeah.
[46:43.61]Scared of scared to Ster.
[46:45.39]So we go Ster to Criken.
[46:47.39]Then after this we go.
[46:50.04]Me wait didn't squeaks me too.
[46:55.50]I think you're getting waited in this course wasn't.
[46:58.74]Ster to squeak Ster squeak Ster squeaks, right?
[47:00.67]Yeah, yeah.
[47:02.61]OK, Ster to squeaks.
[47:06.07]Oh no.
[47:08.94]And that is Sexy Minion versus... This is going to be a crazy fight, by the way.
[47:14.99]You're both so juiced up, it's not even funny.
[47:18.09]Yeah, but I got no speed or defense.
[47:21.18]So it's a one hit, for sure.
[47:24.18]It might be a one hit either way.
[47:28.73]Since Ster abandoned me in Abiotic Factor, I'm going to say, Squeaks, you got this, buddy.
[47:32.59]Let's freaking go, Poke.
[47:33.89]I was waiting for your support.
[47:35.38]Let's go.
[47:36.46]I'm excited.
[47:37.24]Wow, definitely not playing anymore now.
[47:40.23]Yeah, you unsold it.
[47:43.03]Wait, did you really?
[47:45.94]I was running out of room.
[47:47.08]How far did you get?
[47:47.76]Did you get to the one security guard that sounds like me?
[47:51.89]No.
[47:52.99]Oh, that's a shame.
[47:54.79]We got halfway.
[47:55.39]No, we didn't.
[47:56.58]Okay.
[47:58.14]I got to tell you, I'm putting my money on sexy minion here.
[48:02.96]I'm scared that sexy minion has the full arena charge at the start.
[48:08.07]Yeah.
[48:08.71]Would you go ahead and look at the power levels?
[48:10.91]Oh my god, the power is really high on all these guys.
[48:15.00]That sounds like you were coming out of my car.
[48:21.85]What a beautiful battle here we're gonna have on the battlefield.
[48:25.48]Come on, minion.
[48:27.33]Let's see what he's got.
[48:28.63]Here we go.
[48:29.15]This is a big one.
[48:29.81]This could decide.
[48:31.45]Yeah, it's insane.
[48:34.10]This might decide who wins it.
[48:36.08]That's pretty wild.
[48:36.90]975.
[48:37.94]I feel like I was solely focusing on power.
[48:42.99]Not good enough.
[48:43.77]Didn't you give your monster drugs every day?
[48:48.57]No, no.
[48:49.44]I could have gone harder.
[48:50.24]I wanted to hit the max.
[48:53.24]Well, here we go.
[48:54.74]Good luck.
[48:56.25]Oh, fuck, my hands.
[48:57.03]Big attack.
[48:59.13]And... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[49:23.70]Oh, the grit.
[49:25.39]The grit.
[49:27.51]Squeaks is the one to beat here in bracket one.
[49:29.27]Amazing.
[49:31.07]Squeaks, did you know your character had that?
[49:33.50]Not a clue.
[49:34.82]I have no idea.
[49:35.86]I don't even know how you get grit.
[49:37.86]That's crazy.
[49:40.75]Like, what is it?
[49:42.47]So I think it's only for certain monster breeds, I think.
[49:45.61]I think Gris can't get one shot, which is like, this is the whole tournament.
[49:50.54]Smart build.
[49:51.08]It's a smart build.
[49:52.64]Thank you.
[49:53.47]I Googled Reddit, Poke.
[49:55.23]Don't walk back.
[49:59.63]Don't walk back.
[50:01.33]Oh, get in.
[50:01.97]Oh, God.
[50:03.85]oh my god oh that's oh it wasn't the one shot though it wasn't the one shot he's confused he's confused right in the head brain damage come on yes oh why did you get a weapon that's not a weapon he was born with that like trust me it's adhered to his hands how's that part of your monster
[50:29.85]I feel like this monster is cheating he has a weapon he has his own face as a picture on his side of his body he can't close his mouth his back legs don't work right hey you can talk about me but you you leave sexy minion out of your mouth but not born wrong uh squeaks congratulations thank you so much I'm honored two dubs
[50:55.94]That is the first 2-0.
[50:59.11]Which, if we take a look at the standings real quick.
[51:02.63]Uh... Apparently Squeaks with 2-0.
[51:05.63]Everybody else has 1-1 except Poke.
[51:07.71]Unfortunately, you are at 0-2.
[51:10.66]But it's okay.
[51:11.10]It's not over yet.
[51:11.94]This is the first bracket.
[51:16.10]Alright, so next we go to... I believe it's me and... It's me and Vinny?
[51:25.61]That would be favorable.
[51:29.56]I think it's me and Vinny.
[51:31.11]I would enjoy that.
[51:33.01]Okay, let's go.
[51:34.42]Broke and a loser.
[51:37.76]Hey, be nice to Brooke, boy.
[51:40.54]Come on.
[51:41.54]I feel bad for the worm.
[51:43.31]I don't think I'm going to beat you.
[51:44.67]I'm not going to beat you here, Vinny.
[51:46.69]But it'll be fun.
[51:50.91]Just see me next round, by the way.
[51:52.60]See me next round, by the way.
[51:53.98]You're all in so much trouble next round.
[51:55.88]I know.
[51:56.20]I'll see you next round.
[51:57.24]I got this.
[51:58.26]I just want to let you know, though, I'm really honored to be here.
[52:00.93]I worked really hard on all this.
[52:03.39]Yeah.
[52:04.41]With your 13 minutes played.
[52:07.02]It's not 13 minutes.
[52:08.44]That was a fucking lie.
[52:10.14]That was a lie.
[52:10.88]And you can Google.
[52:12.95]Huh?
[52:13.87]You can Google my Steam page.
[52:15.95]Yeah.
[52:16.19]And you'll find out that it's not 30 minutes.
[52:21.68]Yeah.
[52:22.66]Alright.
[52:22.90]So here we go.
[52:24.94]You guys know who's who at this point.
[52:26.40]Let's put the pictures up one more time just for fun.
[52:30.97]That's not even correct, but that's who was in it.
[52:34.40]Yeah.
[52:35.45]Wait, what pictures?
[52:36.39]Did you put up a picture of me, the streamer?
[52:38.34]I'm putting up pictures of you guys, yeah, to show who's who.
[52:40.94]What are you using for me?
[52:42.60]I don't know.
[52:42.96]This one?
[52:45.33]I'm not on your stream right now, Jerm.
[52:48.03]I just put it on my screen.
[52:49.31]People will show it to you.
[52:51.39]Alright.
[52:52.82]Hey, what do the boys think about this one?
[52:58.12]Oh, it's mudded by accident.
[52:59.14]I think Champ's winning.
[53:03.05]Oh, that's an old one.
[53:04.35]Oh, shit.
[53:04.87]Okay.
[53:05.58]Yeah, sure.
[53:06.24]That'll work.
[53:07.44]Alright.
[53:07.78]No, Champ's got this.
[53:09.06]Anybody else want to chime in?
[53:10.22]I'm a Champ believer.
[53:11.30]I'm a Champ believer, big time.
[53:14.10]I think Jermaine could time it out.
[53:17.79]Wait, what picture do you have for me?
[53:20.53]Oh, this type didn't poke into Google.
[53:22.43]It was a second thing there.
[53:24.51]Wait, Jermaine, why not?
[53:27.63]That's mine.
[53:28.30]Why is that the second?
[53:29.62]What the hell?
[53:30.50]I don't know.
[53:31.14]It was like the second picture.
[53:34.24]It's a good one, Poke.
[53:35.95]Is that even you?
[53:37.57]Yeah.
[53:38.29]Is it you?
[53:38.88]That is, right?
[53:40.44]Yeah, it's like a stronger mustache or something.
[53:43.26]I don't know.
[53:43.58]I think it's from one of your videos.
[53:46.31]Alright, you guys, let's go.
[53:47.55]Me versus Vinny.
[53:50.08]The health is going to be a factor here.
[53:51.64]Let's go.
[53:52.22]Yermit is one and one.
[53:54.77]Why not Germit, though?
[53:58.88]Never mind.
[53:59.99]Never mind.
[54:01.09]Here we go.
[54:01.53]Here we go.
[54:01.93]Yermit's got a hit in.
[54:02.93]That's not bad.
[54:03.81]Champ is like fluid, like water, like Mr. Miyagi.
[54:07.74]This shit ain't... He's fine.
[54:10.08]He's fine.
[54:10.34]He's fine.
[54:10.78]He's fine.
[54:13.38]Yermit just needs to get a couple more bites and...
[54:16.91]Why'd you get two swings?
[54:19.31]It is graceful, but it can also cut rock and create power.
[54:23.46]Oh, no.
[54:24.08]It is a destructive force, but yet it is beautiful and gives life, but takes life, too.
[54:29.01]That's why Champ will win.
[54:30.63]Get in there.
[54:32.49]He's confused.
[54:33.19]Jump now.
[54:33.58]Jump.
[54:34.96]Oh, damn it.
[54:37.06]Punished.
[54:38.54]That double whip move is crazy.
[54:40.64]Even the radar.
[54:42.01]You got a range and you got a close range or whatever.
[54:45.13]It's pretty good.
[54:46.15]Champ's a good build.
[54:48.51]Thanks, man.
[54:49.15]I'll take credit for that.
[54:52.10]That's how I taught him well.
[54:56.42]Get in there.
[54:59.99]Even though the match looks one-sided, but there is always a chance.
[55:04.59]Suffocation!
[55:06.12]No breathing.
[55:09.30]You're not allowed to breathe in this tournament, sorry.
[55:13.96]Fuck.
[55:14.08]Jump on him!
[55:14.80]Ugh.
[55:18.53]Dodge.
[55:18.97]Man, here we go.
[55:20.81]I built a counterpick dragon against this?
[55:24.90]You haven't even seen, this is not even my main, dude.
[55:27.48]I was picking my off main.
[55:30.19]Just wait till you see my kiss from a rose character.
[55:32.76]I'm going to obliterate all of you.
[55:35.12]Wait, from the Batman and Robin soundtrack?
[55:39.54]That's correct.
[55:40.94]Wow.
[55:44.01]I don't think I'm going to hit you.
[55:45.15]Wow.
[55:48.17]Oh, no.
[55:48.83]Vinny, congratulations.
[55:51.09]Oh, man.
[55:58.66]That's a win.
[55:59.42]That is a win for Vinny.
[56:01.33]Congratulations.
[56:01.97]Close.
[56:02.35]Close.
[56:02.79]Damn.
[56:03.31]Thank you.
[56:03.65]It's almost.
[56:05.84]If you just get rid of that four.
[56:08.52]Good.
[56:11.89]I almost clicked that I won.
[56:15.33]Shit.
[56:15.65]I'm down to.
[56:16.42]Champ has made me proud.
[56:19.00]I don't want to drown him anymore.
[56:20.42]Throw him in the ocean.
[56:21.66]right squeaks and Vinny you currently are in the lead right now but we're going through alright next we got uh Criken versus Ster I believe is the next match coming up here okay this is going to be a big one alright make your daddy proud gourd oh I think my money's on Ster sorry Criken stern's character is strong he's a one-hit kill guy
[56:49.12]My money's on character is really strong to know it is too crazy.
[56:53.26]Yeah, like totally drugged out.
[56:55.73]Oh shit.
[56:57.49]Yeah, but we don't have any great cheaters.
[57:00.64]Oh, it is kind of like a water versus fire thing, because you're like a dragon and I'm like a jello.
[57:07.12]Oh, dude, Jerma, you leaked the stream code.
[57:10.35]Oh, shit, my stream key!
[57:13.37]You just have your stream key in your clipboard at all times, just in case.
[57:17.45]That would be the most insane thing ever.
[57:20.42]Alright.
[57:21.02]Jolasa Raptor versus Yermit.
[57:23.56]Both Raptors, by the way.
[57:24.82]This is going to get interesting.
[57:27.54]Can we get Squeaks commentary?
[57:29.29]Oh, absolutely.
[57:30.43]Let's get Squeaks full.
[57:31.77]By the way, nobody else talked during this but Squeaks.
[57:34.41]Wait, Squeaks, do you have a mixer?
[57:35.87]Squeaks, do you have a mixer?
[57:37.11]I don't have a mixer.
[57:38.02]I have a USB mic.
[57:39.92]Okay, never mind.
[57:41.18]I have a terrible one.
[57:42.04]Alright, here we are.
[57:42.80]It's a lovely day here for Monster Ranching.
[57:44.92]On one side, we got Jalassa Raptor.
[57:46.58]On the other, Yermit 2.0.
[57:48.13]Both drug-addled monsters, but let's see if they have the heart for a victory, folks.
[57:55.09]The audience is going wild on both sides.
[57:58.32]The favorite is Yermit, but you can never count out an underdog story.
[58:02.74]So who's it going to be?
[58:04.26]Yermit or Gelociraptor?
[58:06.95]That was good.
[58:07.37]Yermit 2.0.
[58:08.13]You have to say the full thing.
[58:09.62]I just got word from one of my sponsors.
[58:13.59]I don't want to get in trouble.
[58:14.45]Yermit 2.0 versus Gelociraptor.
[58:18.44]Is that alright?
[58:19.90]Yeah, that's fine.
[58:20.51]my I'm putting my money on gelasa raptor and I've been lost every time okay don't talk during this yeah nobody speak actually don't talk at all excuse me I'm still doing my commentary alright I don't know what I'm hearing in my ears but you will be asked to leave the arena here we are we're still rotating around and three two one go
[58:40.38]Jalassraptor with an insane start, doing an amazing amount of damage.
[58:44.82]Yermit's going to have an uphill battle to climb, but if anyone can do it, it's Yermit.
[58:48.77]Yermit sneaking up, hoping to get one hit, unable to do so, and it's going to be punished by Jalassraptor, and that's game one, folks.
[58:59.26]I think your monster took a huge hit to the head last round, and there were just question marks down here, man.
[59:05.97]It was only question marks.
[59:07.95]He just kind of waddles around.
[59:10.58]Did you see him, like, give up or something?
[59:12.71]Like, he was going for an attack, and then he, like, conceded.
[59:15.76]That was so strange.
[59:16.48]No think, only meet.
[59:20.07]Yeah.
[59:20.19]Alright, here we go.
[59:20.69]Just you wait till he bites.
[59:22.14]Alright, Ster, how about you do the commentary for your own monster now?
[59:26.01]Okay, non-biased commentary coming in.
[59:29.13]He does not want to do this.
[59:31.33]Yermit 2.0 versus Jelociraptor doing the YouTuber voice.
[59:35.05]Thank you everyone for liking and subscribing.
[59:37.24]Ready, fight.
[59:38.62]We got an immediate roll assault coming in from a long range attack knocking down Yermit 2.0 onto the ground.
[59:44.00]Let's walk forward and try and get in here and do our own jumping claw back.
[59:47.20]And that's going to be a KO.
[59:49.17]He has already won.
[59:50.13]It looks like Yermit 2.0 has won this one.
[59:52.85]No one look at the screen.
[59:54.13]Oh, there we go.
[59:55.99]god imagine like a commentator doing that the owner of the thing that's awesome yeah sturt could be a commentator I swear if if you wanted to if you want to
[60:10.40]I could hear him in a League of Legends map.
[60:13.07]What the heck, man?
[60:14.33]This is a one and one here.
[60:16.09]This is coming down to who's probably going to win the tournament, possibly.
[60:20.58]Oh, not the tournament.
[60:21.36]What the fuck?
[60:22.02]Bracket one.
[60:23.69]I don't... Sexy minions too strong, man.
[60:25.85]I don't know if any of us can take them down.
[60:27.51]Alright, who wants to do commentary this time?
[60:30.15]I'm too nervous.
[60:30.61]How about, how about, uh, Ster?
[60:31.95]You do the voice for your character.
[60:33.03]Like the, the sounds.
[60:34.78]Okay.
[60:34.90]I can do the sounds for you.
[60:35.86]You just voice out your character.
[60:37.14]Okay.
[60:37.46]Yeah, sure.
[60:38.91]Alright.
[60:39.79]Ready?
[60:40.09]Go.
[60:40.25]I can do that.
[60:48.66]That's it.
[60:57.10]I'm gonna hit you.
[61:00.08]I'm gonna get you.
[61:01.44]I'm up close.
[61:04.57]Oh my god.
[61:08.14]GG's.
[61:10.11]I thought that was part of the game.
[61:15.91]I'm going to go over there and I'm going to get you.
[61:20.56]Ster, congratulations.
[61:22.18]Damn, Ster!
[61:23.68]You did it.
[61:25.01]Dragon supremacy.
[61:26.35]Dragon supremacy.
[61:28.05]You did it.
[61:30.37]King of the Lichens.
[61:31.03]Wow.
[61:32.43]You did it.
[61:34.30]Where is Ster here?
[61:37.72]Wow, the whole crowd really said you did it.
[61:40.02]Wait, did I fuck the bracket up?
[61:43.76]Where is... Oh, okay, it's one.
[61:47.91]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[61:50.33]Is there a funny way to combine the word drugs with dragons?
[61:56.70]I'm not doing your homework for you.
[61:58.20]Drug and?
[62:00.38]Good, alright, cool.
[62:01.22]I didn't want to have to say that.
[62:02.65]I just thought it was too corny.
[62:04.21]Okay, cool, cool.
[62:05.83]Alright, now we're moving to Poke versus who?
[62:12.03]You guys got to help me out with this bracket here.
[62:13.44]I fucked the whole thing up.
[62:14.44]Wait, what do you mean?
[62:15.44]Is this the same monster, Brokeboy?
[62:17.70]It's Brokeboy.
[62:18.44]Alright, Brokeboy.
[62:21.20]I'm rooting for Brokeboy.
[62:23.13]I know.
[62:23.55]Thank you.
[62:26.31]Who am I against?
[62:28.13]Some people are going to probably have to go two in a row or more than once because it's Squeaks and Poke now.
[62:34.58]Actually, I want Brokeboy dead.
[62:36.67]Hold on.
[62:36.91]No, I want to see that.
[62:37.57]Let's go.
[62:38.91]Alright.
[62:39.25]Let's go.
[62:41.73]See, there's a chance I could win this.
[62:43.88]You want to know why?
[62:44.50]Why?
[62:45.78]Why?
[62:46.06]You have that one life move, right?
[62:47.92]You have that one life move, the true grit.
[62:49.46]But what if I put you at 40% and you stay there and I stay at a high level?
[62:52.77]Who knows?
[62:53.17]That's true.
[62:56.13]Alright.
[62:56.53]Here we go.
[62:57.83]You never know.
[62:58.27]I didn't consider that.
[62:58.88]I didn't consider this.
[63:00.50]Broke boy could show, because here's the thing, even if you don't win the bracket poke, you could soil his bracket.
[63:09.88]Spoil, you could spoil his bracket.
[63:13.57]Because if he loses, you could soil his pants.
[63:18.73]No, please don't.

[66:26.49]Hey, don't blame me.
[66:29.09]It's sexy minion.
[66:31.46]I'm just the trainer.
[66:32.68]Sexy Minion's the evil one.
[66:36.71]You know, at the end of the day, he trained me, Poke.
[66:39.65]It was really sweet.
[66:40.87]He taught you how to love.
[66:42.75]Yeah, he really did.
[66:43.78]Some would say that he taught me.
[66:45.48]Yeah, that's funny.
[66:46.74]Yeah, my sexy Minion teacher.
[66:49.24]Alright.
[66:54.37]Squeaks, congratulations.
[66:55.63]You are now 3-0.
[66:57.82]Let's freaking go.
[66:58.70]Who even is going to stand a chance?
[67:01.72]my second guy is way worse okay good like way worse my same guy is not even two years old I mean he keeps dying alright uh we are now going to who is not gone in a little while I think we're caught up now so now we go back to the top right round robin is kind of confusing once you get past the first like three rounds
[67:30.37]But yeah, it's it looks like it's going to be squeaks.
[67:32.71]You need to lose one or two in a row.
[67:36.61]Or you are going to win the bracket.
[67:39.46]I want so I don't want to lose.
[67:41.92]I'm ready.
[67:43.20]Somebody somebody just said this is a cursed format.
[67:45.78]This is the way they do it in Monster Ranger.
[67:47.98]Yeah, this is literally how the game works.
[67:50.15]This is how the game actually works.
[67:51.49]It's a graphic too.
[67:52.35]I would know all of it.
[67:53.37]Honestly, I think that the circle is reversed from the game.
[67:57.07]I've been thinking this the whole time.
[67:58.69]What do you mean?
[68:00.17]I think in the game, when you win, you get an X. No.
[68:03.62]No.
[68:03.70]And you've been doing circles.
[68:05.06]I swear.
[68:06.28]You're wrong.
[68:06.68]When is a circle?
[68:07.38]An X is like a... What do you mean?
[68:09.16]A circle is like on.
[68:11.21]X almost always represents some kind of failure.
[68:13.27]Did any of you play the game?
[68:14.23]Yeah.
[68:14.35]O's are losing.
[68:15.17]I certainly did.
[68:15.87]Alright.
[68:16.41]So I think we're going... I think Squeaks, I think you might go again.
[68:19.18]I think we do Kriken and Squeaks now.
[68:21.34]I think that's actually how it's going to work.
[68:22.50]We start off with that, though.
[68:23.32]I think we go top to bottom.
[68:25.13]Or do we... It really doesn't matter.
[68:26.67]Everyone's going to play everybody once anyways.
[68:28.99]I already played Squeaks, though.
[68:30.23]On the new monsters or the old one?
[68:32.24]Oh, I don't think me and Squeaks.
[68:34.14]Yeah, I think Vinny and I go against each other.
[68:37.86]Yeah.
[68:39.18]Yes.
[68:40.22]So Vinny, you are here.
[68:43.75]Okay.
[68:43.97]So yeah, Vinny versus Squeaks.
[68:46.69]Alright, Vinny, you have to win this right now.
[68:48.73]This is a must win scenario.
[68:51.11]I'm going to put all of my love and thoughts and prayers into my monster.
[68:58.44]And I might, I don't know, maybe drop some Coca-Cola in there too or something.
[69:03.83]I don't know.
[69:05.52]Hey, even if you only have four minutes in the game and you... Tell us the truth, Vinny.
[69:12.57]What happened?
[69:13.86]I played like 90 minutes and then I had to go on a vacation and stuff.
[69:20.44]So I oversaw someone.
[69:23.72]Someone was on my behalf with my supervision and my guidance and my thoughts and prayers helped me train up my monsters.
[69:32.68]And...
[69:35.83]It was all above board.
[69:37.66]He would like text you and say like, is it okay if I give him like meat today?
[69:41.25]Yeah, we were in close contact.
[69:43.39]Yeah, Rye Epley, thank you for being in close contact with me.
[69:48.26]We were in touch like all day, every day.
[69:50.13]Yeah, it was crazy.
[69:51.13]So you're like one of those parents that gives their kid an iPad too early?
[69:53.99]Is that what I'm hearing?
[69:56.25]yes it was someone else to give the kid an iPad he wasn't there yeah okay yeah too early before 30. but every drill but but what I've been told I'm looking at I'm looking at my chat here I'm looking at my and my Discord uh I've been told that you did receive every drill you got an up you had a text update after every drill to make sure you confirmed or denied if you wanted it to happen right
[70:17.94]That's correct.
[70:18.52]Yeah.
[70:18.74]It was, it was, we were in close contact.
[70:20.42]Yeah.
[70:20.82]Okay.
[70:21.40]That's fine then.
[70:22.08]I'm okay with that.
[70:23.80]Alright.
[70:24.48]Alright.
[70:24.72]This is a, can we wait?
[70:26.41]I gotta pee.
[70:27.67]Yeah.
[70:29.35]Alright.
[70:29.85]I don't pee now.
[70:33.35]I actually do have to go to the bathroom.
[70:34.84]Don't wait for poke.
[70:37.46]I don't have to pee.
[70:39.24]Oh, I can, I can hold it in too.
[70:41.08]Let me look at this right now.
[70:42.06]Alright.
[70:42.34]So Vinny, if you win this, you, you guys will be tied for first.
[70:50.47]That's good.
[70:51.15]And then Ster would need to win his next to be tied for first.
[70:57.42]Yeah, I think it's what only Vinny and Ster have one loss.
[71:01.37]And squeaks has no losses.
[71:03.13]And we're not still running.
[71:04.83]Yeah, and we're not doing the ko thing.
[71:06.44]Because if there's ties at the end, it's chaos.
[71:09.58]But they're all going to be chaos.
[71:14.31]Wait, so then we're gonna do the same thing with our second monster, right?
[71:17.69]And then we're gonna add up.
[71:18.73]Okay, gotcha.
[71:21.15]I'm scared for sexy minion.
[71:22.45]I don't know how he's going to handle a loss.
[71:27.08]Well, if you do lose, you might not lose, right?
[71:29.88]You might sweep the whole bracket.
[71:32.95]I'm back.
[71:33.25]I peed.
[71:34.15]Sorry.
[71:34.49]We good?
[71:36.09]Yep.
[71:37.01]Okay.
[71:40.41]I'm ready.
[71:41.00]I'm ready.
[71:41.30]I'm going to pour some monster energy into champ.
[71:43.62]Alright, guys.
[71:44.72]Here it comes.
[71:46.16]This is a big one.
[71:48.79]Point.
[71:53.28]Big dog.
[71:55.82]That's so scary.
[71:57.45]It's like frame one.
[71:59.55]Avoid the spear.
[72:00.87]Use the whip.
[72:02.47]Suffocation.
[72:04.05]Breathing.
[72:05.15]Come on, champ.
[72:06.79]Javelin.
[72:07.83]Oh, no.
[72:11.66]Come on, champ.
[72:12.26]We have an emotional connection.
[72:15.32]Dude, that's big.
[72:16.46]That's huge.
[72:17.78]One more of those.
[72:19.12]Oh.
[72:23.44]Why didn't he cheat for you?
[72:27.74]He didn't cheat for champ.
[72:29.79]I'm so proud of you, champ.
[72:31.39]Wait, he didn't do the grit?
[72:33.85]There's a chance of grit.
[72:35.03]It doesn't always grit.
[72:37.04]It's not gotten lucky.
[72:37.98]I feel like a proud father.
[72:45.99]Yeah, Minion doesn't get dinner tonight.
[72:47.53]You're like a stepfather.
[72:50.45]Yeah, like a proud stepfather.
[72:51.89]A proud Stepford wife.
[72:55.02]Let's go.
[72:56.32]Let's get in there, champ.
[72:57.78]Come on.
[72:59.14]Come on.
[72:59.72]Oh, yeah.
[73:01.10]Oh, no.
[73:02.34]Get him nice.
[73:05.05]Oh, my God.
[73:06.33]Holy shit.
[73:07.53]That was brutal.
[73:09.71]You got him close and drowned him and then left.
[73:12.53]Just drink him.
[73:13.69]What is he doing?
[73:14.90]You just slurped.
[73:16.60]He must have had one second of air.
[73:19.92]Dude, that's the first week's loss.
[73:23.38]I don't think he's coming back.
[73:24.76]Link defeated this thing so easily in Ocarina of Time, too.
[73:28.19]It's not even funny.
[73:32.67]Okay, so now that makes it pretty interesting here.
[73:34.63]Ster, if you win... Dude.
[73:42.42]If I beat Brokeboy.
[73:46.25]If you beat Brokeboy, that's right.
[73:49.20]I'll see if I can do it.
[73:51.84]Alright.
[73:53.10]Next is, I think, actually, Ster, you are up next, aren't you?
[73:56.97]Versus... You tell me, tournament daddy.
[74:01.91]Cool.
[74:03.82]Yeah, this is... Yeah, Ster, you are up next.
[74:05.56]And Ster versus Poke.
[74:09.20]So, Poke, you could make this work.
[74:12.31]Let's do it.
[74:15.19]Oh, I really need Poke to win.
[74:21.55]can do this I believe boy can do this I want to see broke boy win I really do I'm like like I would I would sacrifice my water just to see broke boy win one that would be so nice we almost got a chance to see it too it was it was so wonderful time for broke boy to be fixed boy come on that's sweet it's sweet
[74:44.58]Alright, here we go.
[74:46.98]Oh my god.
[74:49.04]This does not look good.
[74:50.91]This looks like a puzzle piece, like, you know, put together.
[74:54.01]Your stats are hurting me.
[74:58.99]Oh god.
[74:59.61]Okay, this might end very quickly, but we'll go for it.
[75:03.48]Good luck, guys.
[75:04.42]It's gonna be great.
[75:05.60]I'm coming to get you.
[75:08.60]I'm coming to get you.
[75:10.80]I'm coming over here.
[75:16.88]This is it right here, holy shit
[75:38.93]That was cool for a second.
[75:41.32]Dude, I want you so badly to just have him just string the bytes together and kill somebody.
[75:46.90]What does power do?
[75:48.14]I actually don't know.
[75:51.37]It gives you power.
[75:52.23]It just makes your hits.
[75:54.19]Do I lose a turn?
[75:55.51]It's like grit.
[75:56.52]A chance at low life that you just get stronger.
[76:01.14]I don't know exactly how it works, but here we go.
[76:08.52]Come on, bite.
[76:11.22]Come on.
[76:12.30]That ass move, man.
[76:15.70]Get him.
[76:16.33]Get his ass.
[76:17.31]Oh, eat him.
[76:20.29]Oh, that was BM.
[76:21.27]Why do you do like a way better bite?
[76:23.13]Your bite is like... It's because he's got 950 power.
[76:32.15]Wait, what was that?
[76:33.31]What did you say?
[76:37.76]Nothing.
[76:38.64]Nothing.
[76:38.96]I didn't do anything.
[76:41.75]But what did you just say?
[76:43.03]You just said something about taking something?
[76:44.87]What was it?
[76:45.73]I trained normal.
[76:47.44]It was frosted mini-wheats.
[76:50.44]Yeah.
[76:51.34]He's natty.
[76:52.14]That's it, right?
[76:52.89]Just frosted mini-wheats?
[76:54.05]Nothing else?
[76:55.11]Milk.
[76:58.21]Sure you didn't take anything?
[76:59.24]No.
[77:01.60]Okay.
[77:05.33]alright poke uh that is uh poke you are currently oh and four it's sad you shouldn't be he's so cool it's okay I'll be five and no four no next one my next character is all ploy
[77:23.34]alright so now uh your next character is stronger I don't know we're getting down to the last couple of matches here I'll take that as a yes I really don't know I don't know we're gonna find out I guess all of us together so who I think it's me who am I going I think it's me versus who have I not gone against me versus a squeak I think me versus squeaks yeah and I also gotta face Vinny
[77:51.72]Yep.
[77:52.04]And that's also a worm.
[77:53.16]I thought that there's only one model in this game.
[77:56.77]It's a worm also.
[77:59.17]I'm going to I think I'm going to beat you here, Squeaks.
[78:02.33]I have two worms.
[78:05.16]Well, you have two worms.
[78:06.74]No, you don't.
[78:07.22]That would have been hilarious.
[78:08.88]That would've been crazy if you rolled two.
[78:12.22]Isn't there like 185 like monsters in this?
[78:15.85]Not even counting variants, like just different types.
[78:18.53]Especially.
[78:19.05]I almost had a domino.
[78:20.89]A domino?
[78:22.03]Is it domino rare?
[78:22.85]I had a domino song.
[78:24.23]One of my guys was a domino block.
[78:27.68]I don't know.
[78:28.04]I've never seen that.
[78:28.80]Is it?
[78:29.24]That's cool.
[78:30.20]Wait, oh, you mean it was like a big wall?
[78:32.36]Yeah, but it was like a domino.
[78:33.66]It had like domino things on it.
[78:35.99]That's cool.
[78:37.67]And what song was that?
[78:40.11]It was a dance, Gavin dance song.
[78:44.03]Why didn't you train that one?
[78:46.40]It wasn't my favorite song.
[78:48.86]Oh.
[78:49.80]It was Gigi's songs.
[78:51.34]Alright, come on, Minion.
[78:53.17]I think Yermit has potential with his life.
[78:56.91]I'm scared.
[78:57.15]Minion, if he doesn't get an early kill, he's kind of, it's an uphill battle for him.
[79:03.04]Let's do it.
[79:03.80]Come on, Yermit.
[79:04.46]Show him that, ask the question why there's so many rainbows with, oh!
[79:10.73]Huge hit.
[79:11.47]What is that?
[79:12.53]What is that?
[79:13.08]He just has everything?
[79:15.22]What is that?
[79:16.40]Dude, he killed him.
[79:17.86]What is that?
[79:22.21]Let's go, sexy minion.
[79:24.51]I feel like you are a Diablo character, and I am a random minion out in the Bloodmoor.
[79:32.98]That's how, that's what just happened.
[79:34.98]I was one of those little imps in Bloodmoor.
[79:37.42]The text is still there.
[79:40.38]It is.
[79:40.85]It got nervous when it went away.
[79:43.57]Sorry.
[79:44.29]Alright, just throw the spear at me again and kill me.
[79:46.89]Instant rush.
[79:48.01]Oh, okay.
[79:48.61]He's going slow.
[79:49.67]Oh.
[79:50.78]Oh, he's holding on.
[79:52.64]He's holding on.
[79:55.66]Oh.
[79:55.93]Right on the head.
[79:57.65]Why does he have the instant rush move, man?
[79:59.59]That shit is nuts.
[80:00.39]That move is crazy.
[80:02.66]Hey, Poke, you know you can give your monsters moves when they go on the Errant Tree?
[80:06.04]Yeah, I know.
[80:08.11]I learned it from the next guy.
[80:09.09]My next guy has moves.
[80:10.59]The Errant Tree.
[80:13.41]Alright, that's me losing to Squeaks.
[80:16.19]And I believe I am now out of the potential to win this bracket.
[80:19.76]I think that's it for me.
[80:22.24]Me too.
[80:22.54]Which is sad.
[80:25.46]It's your tournament.
[80:26.47]Yeah.
[80:27.23]It's alright.
[80:27.75]You know, now you know.
[80:28.53]You should have doped.
[80:29.39]Dude, my next guy, your jaws are going to hit the floor when you see my next guy.
[80:36.24]But he's drugless, right?
[80:38.47]uh hello drugless yeah that doesn't well he took one drug he tried it and he didn't like it and he just decided he wasn't gonna do it anymore alright uh this one this is we're about to determine the winner potentially here so we have yeah so this is a big deal because Criken you could do now I think could you are you still in the runnings potentially
[81:03.04]If Vinny loses here... I might have to do two back-to-back.
[81:05.16]I think you do.
[81:05.62]I had no idea my guys were going to be this good.
[81:08.06]I mean... I worked really hard.
[81:11.33]And we were in close communication.
[81:16.79]Bro, it was hard doing my training last night.
[81:19.07]It was like three hours of just focused clicking the right things.
[81:23.34]Sweating.
[81:24.52]It is.
[81:26.06]It is nerve-wracking.
[81:28.89]then they sometimes like just don't listen to you and stuff like they're temperamental monsters it's tough they do yeah yeah they do ignore you I should have taken drugs I've learned to teach them through neglect you know they're wanting the approval you guys you guys are both like liquid based by the way
[81:49.69]oh oh yeah interesting this is a good one this is gonna be a good one Criken yeah I think this is gonna be tight this is the theme match where like you're you're in the Yu-Gi-Oh TV show and it's the weevil guy who only has bugs in his deck what happens when you when you use suffocate though I don't know can you breathe underwater I mean I am water I think we just meld together if you do that move
[82:14.72]If it damages you, I'm calling bullshit on this game.
[82:17.24]I'm going to get in touch with KOE Tecmo or whatever, and I'm going to tell them.
[82:20.93]This is a pretty balanced fight.
[82:22.93]The defense is what's going to potentially, yeah.
[82:25.63]You just responded to yourself.
[82:30.90]One commentator acting as two.
[82:31.96]That went under the radar for me.
[82:33.10]I absolutely would have just accepted that was what two different people.
[82:36.63]Big match.
[82:37.19]Huge, huge, huge.
[82:39.41]Big end.
[82:40.85]Come on, Jalosh the Raptor.
[82:44.18]Alright, I'm gonna do some- I'm gonna do some- Not the suffocate!
[82:47.23]Instant confusion.
[82:48.53]They're combining!
[82:51.69]They're combining!
[82:59.24]Ooh!
[82:59.76]Oh my god, champ!
[83:01.07]Champ!
[83:01.65]Use your whip!
[83:02.57]Yeah, yeah!
[83:02.83]Double whip!
[83:03.15]From a distance!
[83:04.23]From a distance!
[83:05.15]Oh, champ's got it, champ's got it!
[83:06.61]Turn into a laser!
[83:08.13]Turn into a laser!
[83:08.82]Whoever does the next move wins!
[83:10.56]Jalassraptor!
[83:12.06]Dude, something.
[83:12.62]Oh.
[83:13.58]Oh, man.
[83:15.53]Oh, good job, champ.
[83:16.77]Champ.
[83:17.31]Yes.
[83:17.85]Oh, power.
[83:19.31]Oh, no.
[83:20.31]Yes, champ.
[83:21.73]Oh, my.
[83:22.35]Just whipped him down.
[83:24.52]What a comeback.
[83:25.60]You took too much time taunting.
[83:27.06]You taunted, and it was your downfall.
[83:29.36]Yeah.
[83:30.56]You don't need to say the word power.
[83:31.96]You could just kill.
[83:33.02]Just attack, dude.
[83:34.85]Yeah, the power buff is bad.
[83:36.05]I think it was waste your turn.
[83:39.73]Oh, that was close.
[83:40.51]That was the best fight probably all day.
[83:42.89]That was so close.
[83:44.83]Alright.
[83:50.16]Here we go.
[83:51.64]It doesn't use a turn.
[83:52.16]This is very exciting.
[83:53.69]There's no turns.
[83:59.29]Do the roll move.
[84:00.47]Do the roll move now.
[84:01.96]Whip it.
[84:02.30]Whip it good.
[84:03.26]Oh, my God.
[84:04.04]No.
[84:04.96]It doesn't do anything.
[84:05.82]It is bullshit.
[84:06.54]That should not do anything, but I'll take it.
[84:10.62]Oh, this hit percentage chance is killing you.
[84:13.78]What's the bottom bar mean?
[84:14.81]What's guts mean?
[84:15.83]That's your mana.
[84:19.03]Yeah, that's what the moves cost.
[84:20.72]He's just not.
[84:21.92]Oh, no.
[84:22.94]Come on.
[84:24.39]That could be big.
[84:25.53]Oh, my God.
[84:27.29]It's anyone's match again.
[84:28.43]It's anyone's match.
[84:29.85]Oh, never saw that before.
[84:32.21]Champs got it.
[84:33.20]Champs got it.
[84:33.90]Could it happen?
[84:35.08]Could it happen?
[84:36.46]He's got too much power.
[84:38.48]Attack.
[84:39.56]That's it.
[84:40.88]No, it's not.
[84:41.64]No, it's not.
[84:41.98]It's not.
[84:42.62]Oh, my God.
[84:44.59]That's it.
[84:46.23]Holy.
[84:46.49]This is crazy.
[84:47.25]The water creatures are putting up the best fight of the night.
[84:50.23]Yeah.
[84:52.09]Oh, my God.
[84:52.43]What a fire match.
[84:54.63]Dude.
[84:56.83]You soiled his fucking pants, man.
[85:01.04]He shit on his pants.
[85:04.68]Oh, here we go.
[85:05.28]Here we go.
[85:05.80]One more match.
[85:06.52]Champ, I believe in you.
[85:07.99]Through all the power of neglect, I've taught you so well.
[85:14.91]Let's go.
[85:15.57]Hog champ.
[85:17.26]Hog champ.
[85:18.34]Come on.
[85:18.70]Come on, crowd.
[85:19.22]Get the crowd going.
[85:19.98]Come on.
[85:20.42]Now all the confusion immediately.
[85:23.55]Oh.
[85:24.46]Double, double whip, double whip.
[85:27.10]Oh, I don't like that hit.
[85:28.85]I don't like that hit at all.
[85:30.13]One more of those.
[85:34.19]Come on, champ.
[85:36.47]Champ, turn into water and suffocate again.
[85:39.14]Don't suffocate again.
[85:39.92]He's already water.
[85:42.06]Oh, Criken, you got no mana.
[85:45.16]He keeps missing these 60%.
[85:47.40]Come on, now, now.
[85:48.72]Do it.
[85:49.59]This is your chance.
[85:51.03]Champ!
[85:51.77]Champ!
[85:52.85]That wasn't enough damage, champ.
[85:56.09]We need more, buddy.
[85:56.93]Come on.
[85:57.83]Fight.
[85:58.57]Jumping Claw.
[85:59.17]Anything.
[85:59.53]Do a move.
[86:01.21]Oh, no.
[86:04.54]He just stares all day.
[86:06.04]Moving as gracefully as the water.
[86:09.06]That's so sad.
[86:10.28]It was like watching a river.
[86:13.51]That was tough.
[86:15.29]Why didn't he attack?
[86:16.99]One thing's for sure, guys.
[86:18.37]Everyone watching this in the stadium right now is fully soaked.
[86:23.56]As their lifeblood is thrown out into the audience.
[86:29.19]Yeah.
[86:29.37]Alright, so that was Criken and Vinny.
[86:34.23]I think I haven't gone against Poke either.
[86:36.58]Yes, you need to do Poke and I need to go against Ster.
[86:41.32]We'll save that one.
[86:42.39]We'll save that one for last.
[86:44.13]Yeah, the Yermit battle.
[86:46.95]That's what I've been waiting for.
[86:47.99]Oh, Yermit versus anti-Yermit.
[86:52.00]We'll do Poke and Criken right now.
[86:54.09]Yeah.
[86:54.31]Alright.
[86:55.47]Take a look at Stanley.
[86:56.01]Come on, broke boy.
[86:56.55]Wake up.
[86:57.79]This could be broke boy's time.
[87:00.81]Ster, I hope I make it so you don't win second place.
[87:05.18]We're going to fight.
[87:05.72]Dude, Squeaks and Vinny are going to do a match to determine who wins.
[87:09.79]Oh, no.
[87:10.11]I've only lost to Vinny.
[87:12.21]And you guys have to do a rematch.
[87:15.29]Oh, no.
[87:17.32]I'm scared of being suffocated.
[87:18.92]Criken and Poke.
[87:20.56]That's my biggest fear.
[87:23.52]In life?
[87:24.64]No, it's just dying.
[87:26.80]I guess me too.
[87:30.36]Yeah, that's pretty big.
[87:31.04]That's pretty big deal.
[87:32.59]Yeah.
[87:33.63]Or spiders as well.
[87:34.69]It's also pretty scary, but dying of spiders.
[87:38.43]Spider death.
[87:39.09]Oh, man.
[87:40.27]Drowning in spiders.
[87:43.56]Is there a spider variant of the water guy where it's all spiders instead of jelly?
[87:47.84]There's so much stuff that I haven't even seen, honestly.
[87:50.48]Yeah, it might be.
[87:52.46]What song do you have to play to get Spider Guy, I wonder?
[87:55.54]Korn or something?
[87:56.89]Yeah, Korn.
[87:57.47]Oh, Korn was one of the ones I almost went for.

[92:27.10]It's fucking time.
[92:28.60]It's time.
[92:29.24]Look at all the big power.
[92:31.20]I did drugs.
[92:32.43]I did steroids for an entire year.
[92:36.05]I did it naturally.
[92:37.03]Oh, look at me.
[92:37.55]I made the rules of the tournament.
[92:39.68]I chose this and I'm mad about it.
[92:43.04]Yeah.
[92:43.80]Well, guess what?
[92:45.25]Take a look at what happens when the power of positivity.
[92:49.82]If every single person in my chat right now just thinks positively about what's about to happen, we're going to win.
[92:56.41]Everyone think negative in mine.
[92:59.19]I need more people thinking positive.
[93:00.49]Everyone think about something else.
[93:01.77]Think about something else.
[93:03.05]Anything else.
[93:04.06]Think of your favorite TV show.
[93:05.74]No.
[93:07.22]Mess up all the vibes.
[93:09.20]There's so many songs about rainbows.
[93:15.93]What's the win condition for Yermit?
[93:18.30]What's he got to do?
[93:19.20]Oh, excuse me.
[93:19.82]Oh, here we go.
[93:21.72]Okay.
[93:23.62]Tickle him.
[93:24.85]Damn.
[93:26.57]Big bro version.
[93:30.19]Oh, no.
[93:31.05]Oh, no.
[93:32.42]This is so evil.
[93:34.86]This shouldn't be allowed.
[93:35.88]I feel like this is all fucked up.
[93:38.31]It doesn't feel right.
[93:39.77]It feels icky.
[93:40.55]Have you been half asleep?
[93:43.17]Or have you heard voices?
[93:45.82]I hear them calling my name.
[93:50.75]Is this the sweet sound that called the sailors?
[93:56.79]Come on, Yermit.
[93:57.28]Moving right along.
[94:01.24]Just bite him once.
[94:02.22]Just bite him one time.
[94:06.57]Oh.
[94:08.01]Okay.
[94:10.57]Oh, fireball.
[94:11.32]Oh, nice fireball.
[94:12.34]I think a big attack here from Yermit.
[94:15.60]Okay.
[94:15.82]Hold on.
[94:17.63]He's got low guts.
[94:18.39]If you keep biting him, keep his guts low.
[94:21.49]Oh, never mind.
[94:24.33]Come on.
[94:27.25]Come on.
[94:30.42]He's taking it easy on you, pup.
[94:32.02]Do it.
[94:36.90]He's just embarrassing you.
[94:39.11]Oh, that's alright.
[94:39.89]He's dragging it out.
[94:40.67]Oh, no, you hit me.
[94:42.54]He's doing his comedy move on you.
[94:50.42]He's giving you a chance.
[94:53.49]It's not fair.
[94:54.57]It's not fair.
[94:55.19]Drugs.
[94:56.23]It's not fair.
[94:57.07]I'm the only one that's natural.
[94:59.86]Broke boy's natural.
[95:01.42]Oh, right.
[95:01.72]That's right.
[95:02.14]I forgot about broke boy.
[95:06.92]I never forgot about broke boy.
[95:09.01]Okay.
[95:09.31]Broke boy is one of the best.
[95:12.61]He'll live on forever.
[95:14.17]Hey, I made it to... Look at this.
[95:17.13]Go ahead, Jerm.
[95:17.87]I made it to time against your 1,000 power monster.
[95:24.62]Couldn't even finish the job.
[95:27.06]Oh, worm.
[95:28.10]Wow.
[95:32.81]Alright, so now we've got... We have to decide this now.
[95:39.57]we oh shit how do you do this three-way tie if it's a three oh this is where ko's matter or how do we how do we how do we handle this three-way tie for first oh we got we gotta bracket up we gotta fight each other I think we just do we do another round robin three-person bracket right is that how that's gonna work yeah I think so you guys get your own bracket alright that sounds good I'm gonna remake the bracket
[96:09.83]My other guy better be good.
[96:14.58]I'm so sad.
[96:16.44]Yeah, I'm scared about my other guy, too.
[96:18.46]I think he's going to flop, unfortunately.
[96:20.73]You know what's interesting about worms?
[96:23.45]In fiction, they are depicted as strong and powerful.
[96:27.03]Look at the Dune franchise.
[96:28.74]You'll notice the worms can devour.
[96:31.04]They are worshipped.
[96:32.60]They're used to create the spice, melange.
[96:35.93]Beetlejuice.
[96:36.97]The worms can kill the spirits of those who are dead.
[96:42.79]Is that the second example you got?
[96:44.33]Do you have a third?
[96:44.93]That's all I have.
[96:46.07]Okay, gotcha.
[96:47.87]I was waiting for number three.
[96:50.80]Earthworm Jim.
[96:51.70]Here we go.
[96:52.52]Earthworm Jim.
[96:55.35]Let's take a look at the results one more time.
[96:57.03]I moved it, but it's fine.
[97:03.22]Okay.
[97:04.48]You guys ready?
[97:05.18]Ready to find out who wins bracket one?
[97:06.48]You forgot me.
[97:08.40]Don't do a better got sexy minion.
[97:10.73]Oh, that was my bad.
[97:12.03]I fucked it up.
[97:13.28]Well, you could do single elimination if you want.
[97:17.84]We could do single elim if you guys want to do that.
[97:24.83]I'm free either.
[97:25.79]What do you guys want to do?
[97:26.39]You guys want to do it this way or do you want to do it single elim?
[97:31.16]I'd say just single.
[97:32.34]Okay.
[97:33.06]We don't need the bracket.
[97:34.44]This is the bonus round.
[97:36.54]Alright, here we go.
[97:37.96]Who wants to go first?
[97:40.15]I guess we're going to do Ster versus squeaks.
[97:43.47]Oh, no.
[97:44.81]Good luck.
[97:46.73]This is very exciting.
[97:49.46]Wait, so everything's on the line.
[97:51.90]Everything is on the line right now.
[97:54.03]It's like drug V. drug.
[97:55.39]Whoever drugged their, like, just juiced up their monster more.
[98:02.54]It's still a fight of power.
[98:04.48]I'm curious who actually wins this fight.
[98:07.39]Because you both, yeah, like, you're both ridiculous.
[98:12.14]Yeah, I think Squeak's gonna come in hot with that first move.
[98:17.09]Yeah, then I'm gonna falter.
[98:18.51]That's all sexy minions got.
[98:21.03]The true grit RNG.
[98:21.87]Here we go.
[98:23.30]Alright, come on, minion.
[98:28.38]Ster versus Squeaks.
[98:29.89]Don't rush, don't rush him.
[98:31.17]No, don't rush!
[98:32.19]Oh, dodge!
[98:33.27]Wow.
[98:33.81]He knows your moves.
[98:35.83]Bite, bite, bite, bite.
[98:37.60]Oh, it's the water hit!
[98:40.32]The grit!
[98:40.52]The grit!
[98:41.46]Oh!
[98:41.71]now god oh okay dude that was immediate that was so sad there was so much grit and then instantly just slapped down yeah that was an anti-climactic uh end to uh sexy minion yeah it's so sad he hits so fast with 50 speed what is 50 what does speed even mean
[99:09.60]It's like dodge chance.
[99:10.70]It's dodge.
[99:11.96]So yeah, actually that first dodge was crazy because it was so low.
[99:14.89]Yeah, hit like your... It's like you got the skill.
[99:20.25]It's skill to speed.
[99:22.81]So it's whatever your skill is against the other person's speed.
[99:25.98]Because skill is chance to hit.
[99:27.96]Is it a best of one?
[99:28.70]Yeah, wasn't it?
[99:31.97]Oh, I see.
[99:34.99]That's what I thought.
[99:35.95]Alright, well then Ster...
[99:39.54]But what could have happened?
[99:42.04]Oh.
[99:42.84]Oh, no.
[99:43.58]This is the imaginary run back.
[99:47.60]Fireball.
[99:48.04]Fireball.
[99:48.38]Don't fire.
[99:48.91]No, come on, man.
[99:51.59]I taught you that as a joke.
[99:54.03]Okay.
[99:55.27]No.
[99:59.16]Damn.
[100:00.18]Oh, sexy minion.
[100:01.98]Oh, it's too bad it didn't count.
[100:06.20]Oh, that's even sadder.
[100:09.15]right so now or Ster versus um Ster versus the Vinny oh wait yeah this is uh so now this is this is determining who because if it's single limb then that means this is just Ster versus Vinny now no not not single limb just I was just saying to do one round rather than a best oh oh I see okay I see what you said
[100:36.17]Alright, well, here you go.
[100:37.53]Otherwise, you put me in the loser bracket.
[100:40.23]That's true.
[100:42.10]You put like Vinny.
[100:43.68]He's already at the top.
[100:44.90]He's in winners.
[100:45.90]You already like get a buy.
[100:48.62]Alright.
[100:48.86]Vinny versus Vinny versus Ster.
[100:52.13]I am ready.
[100:55.03]Same deal.
[100:55.41]Let's go.
[100:58.95]So if Ster wins this, he wins everything, right?
[101:03.14]Yeah.
[101:04.30]If Ster wins this, this is just it.
[101:06.70]Alright, Vinny, I believe.
[101:08.86]Whoever wins gets to make their merch of their character.
[101:16.65]Oh, dude.
[101:17.69]Whoever wins gets a PlayStation 5.
[101:21.86]Oh, shit.
[101:22.62]Wait a second.
[101:28.46]Alright, Ster, can you win the first bracket with your monster?
[101:32.31]Let's find out.
[101:34.67]That's a good question.
[101:35.69]We will find out.
[101:39.62]I want Champ to win so bad, but I'm going to be unbiased.
[101:44.73]I think that's the definition of being biased.
[101:46.57]Yeah, it's a little biased, but you know what?
[101:48.07]Champ is going to... Oh my god!
[101:51.43]There could still be a tie, right?
[101:55.98]If someone else gets two wins?
[101:57.86]Can anybody get two wins now?
[102:01.55]No.
[102:02.86]I don't think so that's it wait a minute didn't they fight twice last time yeah but the second one didn't count it was for fun oh yeah because because it is mathematically not possible for either one of you to get two wins oh yeah because I'm the third person wait so should I fight Vinny for second place yes yeah for a second right yeah ah okay alright here we go guys unfortunately Ster is just too strong yeah 975 power is crazy
[102:33.37]horseshit is what it is I want to thank the academy and then sometimes he's like Vinny are you mad at me and I'm like no Ster my child I'm not and now I am yes my son Vinny thinks he's god and if I don't worship every Sunday he gets upset it is I do stream on Sunday that's actually true
[102:56.67]Why weren't you there last time?
[102:58.29]Where was he?
[102:58.89]Where was he?
[102:59.63]Why weren't you there?
[103:00.86]Alright, here we go.
[103:01.74]I was asking for you.
[103:02.98]In this bracket.
[103:05.06]Here we go.
[103:06.56]Vinny.
[103:06.76]I've never beat Champ.
[103:09.01]No.
[103:09.23]This will be a first win.
[103:11.65]Yeah.
[103:13.39]Engage.
[103:13.77]I believe.
[103:14.54]Winner gets a cucumber.
[103:16.50]Deal.
[103:19.80]How about this?
[103:20.83]How about this?
[103:21.67]Okay, wait a second.
[103:23.21]Hey, thanks a lot.
[103:25.54]How about this?
[103:27.44]How about this?
[103:28.59]You didn't even get a chance to talk.
[103:30.17]I was going to say me and Squeaks were planning to grab some pizza.
[103:33.69]I was going to say winner buys a slice for the loser.
[103:40.12]It feels good to win.
[103:41.50]Thank you, Jerma, for the PS5 as part of this.
[103:44.96]Hey, that's right.
[103:46.12]You just got yourself a PlayStation 5.
[103:49.35]That's true.
[103:49.85]That's a binding contract.
[103:51.41]If that's the word for the first bracket, I can't wait to see what the whole tournament is.
[103:55.16]true wait winner gets a PS5 pro yeah I got it with two controllers it just arrived yesterday alright do you guys want to take a quick break before we do the the second bracket uh yeah I'm down I have to go to the bathroom how you guys doing we've been we've been going for about an hour and a half I'm good I'm ready for my next dude to just sweep the tournament yeah this this one's gonna be I'm I'm gonna actually compete in this one for real

[104:22.83]It did.
[104:23.23]You were like, oh, it's gonna be like 40 minutes, an hour, but here we are.
[104:26.02]You got a lot of meat out of this.
[104:27.50]This is a good piece of meat.
[104:29.30]This has been fun.
[104:30.79]Can we just, like, go train for, like, two months and do drugs?
[104:34.21]This is a solid cucumber right here.
[104:35.75]No, nobody can do drugs right now.
[104:37.98]Go pee, go do what you gotta do, come back and... No, I'm talking about our characters, not... We have to fight on drugs and the character be sober?
[104:46.45]What if I don't have to pee?
[104:48.89]you don't have to pee you can hang out and let me just make the second bracket and we'll just get going alright I'm doing random so I'm just writing random names here so it'll be different um than last time we did a prediction over on my side and someone just won four million channel points for predicting the whole thing wow wow
[105:19.04]That's crazy, man.
[105:20.32]That's a lot of channel points.
[105:22.83]What's your highest reward, Criken, on your channel?
[105:26.29]They can add and remove an emote for a million channel points each.
[105:32.08]That's crazy.
[105:33.94]Permanently?
[105:36.16]Yeah, until someone else removes it.
[105:37.66]Holy shit.
[105:39.36]So it's one rotating emote?
[105:41.79]No, you can keep adding new ones.
[105:44.73]What if they remove your best ones?
[105:47.29]That's happened.
[105:48.13]There's been wars over culture of specific characters that keep getting killed and then brought back.
[105:54.88]You got lore, dude.
[105:56.06]You got some lore.
[105:57.83]Okay.
[105:58.35]Yeah, it's all just economy stuff.
[106:00.21]Who are you?
[106:02.61]If you guys are here, you got to tell me who you're picking for your monster.
[106:06.00]I know who I'm picking.
[106:06.82]Alright.
[106:08.96]Gormfield.
[106:10.08]Vinny.
[106:10.58]Vinny.
[106:11.04]Gormfield.
[106:13.65]You don't know my voice.
[106:17.58]My guy's name is I'm God.
[106:23.83]Okay.
[106:25.54]Oh, that's funny to me.
[106:27.08]That's great.
[106:27.62]So we got Gormfield.
[106:29.22]We got I'm God.
[106:34.63]First match.
[106:35.31]Hey, dude.
[106:36.21]First match is literally me versus Ster.
[106:38.51]And I am going to destroy him.
[106:40.31]I cannot wait till he cries.
[106:42.19]He's going to be like, No!
[106:45.50]It's not supposed to end like this way!
[106:47.52]And I'm going to laugh in his face.
[106:49.74]Dude, I saw Star Training, the monster that's coming up next, and I can't wait to kill it.
[106:53.53]Yeah.
[106:55.89]You guys are awful.
[106:56.91]He has an emotional attachment to this one.
[106:58.91]The last one was just a means to an end.
[107:01.30]This one is like his son.
[107:06.90]That's true.
[107:07.56]It is true.
[107:11.70]I love this one, but he really did give me so much of a headache I stopped playing.
[107:15.54]Are we good to go?
[107:16.73]I think I'm back.
[107:18.92]Okay.
[107:19.56]Is anyone else pissing out right now?
[107:21.89]Anybody still?
[107:22.41]Oh, perfect.
[107:23.17]Oh, good.
[107:23.97]Alright.
[107:24.51]Yes, sir.
[107:25.69]Can monsters die permanently in this tournament, like during the battle?
[107:29.22]Probably not, right?
[107:29.86]They cannot, no.
[107:31.14]Okay, good.
[107:31.98]But I think, Jerma, isn't it true that if a monster takes three times their health pool in one hit, then in the actual game, they die?
[107:39.99]That's like a permadeath.
[107:40.93]Yes.
[107:41.51]There are conditions for you to guarantee dies.
[107:44.67]Some of them are really, really bad.
[107:46.86]Yeah.
[107:48.62]Alright, some of the ways to die are bad.
[107:51.15]Are you going up against a B chug?
[107:55.60]Good luck.
[107:56.66]What does the B stand for?
[107:58.52]Brian.
[108:00.32]It's Brian Chug.
[108:03.25]I find that hard to believe.
[108:04.37]Oh, what songs?
[108:05.15]What songs?
[108:06.31]Whose name is?
[108:06.80]Wait, was that Kendrick Lamar?
[108:09.53]Yeah.
[108:10.88]Damn.
[108:11.34]What is B Chug?
[108:12.94]I put in from Legend Cup.
[108:16.49]Com.
[108:16.87]Friend Rick Lamar.
[108:18.39]And damn, I got this monster.
[108:22.22]Mine is Kiss from a Rose from Seal.
[108:24.34]That is my favorite song of all time.
[108:26.80]It's a good one.
[108:27.86]It's got like a... It goes... It's very castle-y.
[108:33.16]Badlands Chugs makes music?
[108:36.25]That'd be awesome, though.
[108:38.33]That's Brian Chug.
[108:40.33]Look at the int on this monster.
[108:42.13]I'm going to laser you and kill you instantly.
[108:43.64]I can't wait.
[108:43.98]It's going to feel so good.
[108:45.44]Here we go.
[108:47.30]Who the hell is Brian Chug?
[108:50.02]Am I out of the loop?
[108:51.58]Oh, somebody did this drug-free, by the way.
[108:53.90]No drugs.
[108:54.82]Well, he took one, and he didn't like it, so I didn't do it ever again.
[108:57.17]I didn't do drugs.
[108:58.35]He took one, and he didn't like it.
[109:00.15]I let this monster raise itself.
[109:02.25]If it likes something, I let it do it.
[109:05.44]Here we go.
[109:07.02]Boom.
[109:08.66]Who's B-Trump, though?
[109:09.78]Me.
[109:10.80]Okay.
[109:11.52]Laser him.
[109:11.97]7-10 int without drugs.
[109:15.29]Oh, ew!
[109:15.97]You can't touch him.
[109:16.68]He's too hoppy.
[109:17.74]His eyes don't even connect to his body.
[109:19.40]What the hell was that?
[109:25.95]No!
[109:26.99]Ew!
[109:27.09]Should we be watching?
[109:28.13]Get him one more!
[109:30.21]One more!
[109:30.51]One more!
[109:31.42]Get in there!
[109:31.76]Wait a second.
[109:32.96]Dude, this hit chance is so bad.
[109:34.98]Flick!
[109:36.98]Do anything.
[109:37.78]Get in there.
[109:38.31]Get in there.
[109:38.81]Zero to zero.
[109:39.29]Oh, God.
[109:41.72]Oh, it's over.
[109:43.48]Brian Chug is dead.
[109:44.75]You can't touch him.
[109:45.83]God damn.
[109:47.55]Brian Chug creeps the shit out of me.
[109:48.65]Look at him.
[109:49.87]The Chuggernaut has perished.
[109:52.76]Damn.
[109:55.40]Did you take drugs?
[109:56.47]You took drugs for the int, right?
[109:57.73]I took no drugs.
[109:59.23]There's no int drug.
[110:02.44]But I don't know.
[110:04.70]Alright, float like a raccoon.
[110:06.95]Yes, Bob is brave!
[110:09.13]What was that?
[110:10.53]Yes!
[110:10.65]What the fuck?
[110:11.43]What was that magic?
[110:12.94]That wizardry?
[110:14.90]Holy.
[110:16.56]That wasn't even him.
[110:17.90]That was a 5G tower.
[110:20.95]Okay.
[110:22.47]I just looked at you a certain way and your brain exploded.
[110:26.59]I have to beat you.
[110:32.34]Come on, laser.
[110:35.86]Once I start punching you, I think he sucks away guts.
[110:38.62]What?
[110:39.92]Boom!
[110:41.19]That's a crit.
[110:43.45]Come on, keep it up.
[110:44.19]Keep up the pressure.
[110:44.93]Do not let him kiss you.
[110:48.42]That's crazy.
[110:49.14]What is that?
[110:50.88]The kiss of death.
[110:52.65]Why is this fight so different from all the other fights?
[110:55.79]What the fuck?
[110:58.62]Jerma985. me to death it actually is kiss from a rose you're right yeah yep yep it's it's me it's poetry that is poetry alright I'll take it do you like the Batman movie I love okay Batman forever everybody do yourself a favor if you haven't wait it's from forever oh yeah yeah Batman forever I thought it was from Batman and robin
[111:21.55]No, it's from the first terrible Batman movie of two.
[111:24.82]That one's not that bad.
[111:25.92]Val Kilmer is awesome.
[111:27.24]That's one of my favorite.
[111:29.93]It's one of my favorite movies because if you watch that with an OLED with HDR, it is like the prettiest.
[111:36.68]You can laugh all you want.
[111:37.52]I just beat your ass, by the way.
[111:40.88]That's personal.
[111:44.69]If you watch it on an OLED with HDR, like HDR 100 or whatever, it is the prettiest movie ever made.
[111:50.72]It is so beautiful.
[111:51.92]All the lights, all the explosions, all the different colors.
[111:55.18]It is the most colorful, wonderful movie ever.
[111:57.29]I'm not even kidding.
[111:58.07]Cool.
[111:59.73]I like Val Kilmer as Batman, too.
[112:02.07]Yeah, he was good as Batman.
[112:03.37]Yeah, he's really amazing.
[112:04.96]uh poking guy who has only seen boss baby two hi video you're done so we got gormfield alright gormfield versus who I'm god right okay
[112:19.81]So Gormfield is the Soundgarden album, Super Unknown.
[112:25.48]It's their album that has Black Hole Sun on it.
[112:29.70]It means a lot to me.
[112:30.99]I love Soundgarden and that album is fantastic.
[112:35.29]But if I had to choose one song from it, it would probably be Black Hole Sun because it is a really great song.
[112:41.19]My guy is based off the song I'm God from Clams Casino one of my favorite producers when I was younger Yep, that's it.
[113:06.91]Okay.
[113:07.27]Cool.
[113:07.55]Alright, you know, you know, I
[113:09.94]That sounds like a dish.
[113:12.10]He's a good producer.
[113:14.45]I just keep saying this Animal Crossing character.
[113:19.79]815 power?
[113:21.44]That's a lot, man.
[113:23.64]Both of them are insane.
[113:26.90]I took no drugs.
[113:27.70]I just figured it out my second time.
[113:29.72]Oh yeah?
[113:30.48]This is drug free?
[113:31.98]Drug free!
[113:33.34]That's crazy.
[113:33.90]I have a specific regime.
[113:36.33]Training regime.
[113:37.03]I've never even seen like a mecha dragon in this so he seems pretty juiced.
[113:41.35]This is gonna be a cool one.
[113:42.47]It's Garfield!
[113:43.12]It's actually Garfield.
[113:44.64]Kinda.
[113:45.34]What the fuck?
[113:45.88]Your guy looks so much more imposing and intimidating.
[113:48.66]Your dude looks like fucking Ultima weapon from Final Fantasy 7.
[113:53.57]And my dumb cat has a mustache.
[113:57.73]Ew.
[113:58.11]What?
[113:58.59]I didn't even hurt him.
[114:00.01]He didn't even do any damage.
[114:01.13]What was that?
[114:03.04]What's happening?
[114:04.56]Do something, Gornfield.
[114:05.88]Gornfield, you're fucked.
[114:07.86]My chance to hit is so low.
[114:10.24]It's 5%, dude.
[114:14.43]Oh, here we go.
[114:17.29]Sweep the legs.
[114:18.09]Go one hit.
[114:19.07]What the hell was that?
[114:22.22]I checked my glasses that was an eight level one jrpg enemy versus level 100 dragon the cat wins oh my god better win the whole thing I have no skill and speed I screwed up I screwed up how could you kill a god I didn't know what the stats did you bite him here it could be over oh the dodge
[114:53.15]I think if you hit, you win.
[114:55.48]You just hurt himself.
[114:56.99]He just hurt himself.
[114:58.20]What is that?
[115:00.29]I buy that killing Gormfield more than him licking the dragon to death.
[115:20.03]So you deserve that victory.
[115:22.27]Honestly, here we go.
[115:23.37]Holy shit.
[115:26.86]That's so funny.
[115:27.50]The finale.
[115:28.34]These guys are good.
[115:31.10]You ready?
[115:32.62]Let's go.
[115:33.02]Let's do it.
[115:35.09]You ask him like they're in control.
[115:36.49]I have the controller.
[115:38.65]That was a wild one.
[115:39.93]I want to make sure everybody gets their breath.
[115:43.36]Go, Gornfield.
[115:44.28]No stupid moves.
[115:46.10]Don't do stupid things.
[115:50.63]Is it breaking?
[115:51.85]It's breaking a little bit.
[115:54.43]Oh, no.
[115:55.97]That was so much damage to himself.
[115:57.59]He keeps hurting himself.
[115:58.42]He actually could KO himself.
[116:04.12]Stupid cat.
[116:07.99]Oh, my stomach.
[116:08.97]Be nice to Gormfield.
[116:10.31]He's having a bad day.
[116:11.89]My first win.
[116:13.47]Gormfield, we got him next time.
[116:17.10]Is it Monday afternoon?
[116:18.40]What day is it?
[116:20.88]I hate to be that guy, but Jeremy, you might have to restream it.
[116:25.48]Is it messed up?
[116:26.99]The audio is crackly.
[116:28.97]It's crunchy.
[116:30.31]Snap, crackle, pop.
[116:33.09]Finally, I win.
[116:34.67]Alright, redoing it, rebooting it.
[116:37.17]Thank you.
[116:37.97]It's probably on for too long.
[116:38.99]The glow up from Brokeboy to I'm God is honestly inspiring, Poke.
[116:43.22]It was my first guy, you can tell, right?
[116:46.34]Wait, Gornfield was your first guy?
[116:48.61]Like you trained him before?
[116:49.55]No, I'm Gornfield.
[116:51.35]Brokeboy was my first one.
[116:53.21]Ah, okay, gotcha.
[116:55.10]Is it better?
[116:55.74]Your test.
[116:56.50]Yeah, it's better now.
[116:57.54]Alright, that was a win for Poke.
[117:02.00]Congratulations, Poke.
[117:06.36]Thank you.
[117:06.94]Gormfield, you were, yeah, there you go.
[117:10.85]That's your first win too, that's right, yeah.
[117:13.09]Yep.
[117:14.35]Alright, Quyken and Squeaks.
[117:17.18]What?
[117:18.20]Quyken and Squeaks is up next, and you two were using, Squeaks, you were using this character called Mr. Asquitzero.
[117:28.20]No, Mraz Keto is inspired by Jason Mraz.
[117:31.10]I was looking for I'm Yours.
[117:34.50]But unfortunately, the game did not have it, so I just chose the first album.
[117:39.25]I don't really remember what it was.
[117:41.57]I'm expecting big things out of him.
[117:45.62]This is just Jason Mraz, right?
[117:47.56]Yeah, you know.
[117:48.66]He's very special.
[117:51.09]I like him a lot.
[117:51.89]Criken, your monster has an interesting name.
[117:53.75]It's Claw D. Bussy.
[117:56.71]Right.
[117:59.78]And that's because I was randomizing.
[118:03.77]What is that fucking Godzilla?
[118:05.45]What am I fighting?
[118:06.85]I was randomizing the the music and I came until I saw something I recognized and I came across
[118:15.23]claude bucey the uh the classical artist that made um a claire de lune and uh and so we decided to pick him and then he sped out this lovely lobster so I thought claw the uh pussy was a great damn name okay that's good that's good that's good yeah I and I do have there's a severe lack of speed between the two people that have the same dealer uh because you were taking the same drug
[118:44.25]yeah absolutely 100 picture the left is so bad it's the worst angle wait what is it the picture of the first monster yeah I don't know what that is when you open your iPhone it is like opening your iPhone I don't know what he's looking at alright
[119:12.30]oh god not a good start oh skarner's going in hot okay what's cool about this is they do look like both intimidating monsters like that's they both look scary yeah wow you can't hey that was the thing if somebody had a crazy monster you can't use it in both brackets
[119:38.62]It looks like a FaceTime picture.
[119:40.57]It like feels blurrier, too, doesn't it?
[119:44.95]Like, it feels like it does quality than the rest.
[119:47.54]I don't know something about it.
[119:49.26]Like, look at the mouth.
[119:54.69]Oh, I missed the 82%.
[119:58.02]Oh, oh, man.
[120:00.38]That's a real real.
[120:05.47]Yo, Quad keeps it real.
[120:07.37]Oh, what?
[120:08.40]Oh my god.
[120:08.92]What's going on?
[120:11.26]Real.
[120:11.82]Attack!
[120:12.80]Real.
[120:13.61]What are you doing?
[120:14.27]Attack!
[120:14.43]Why are they not attacking?
[120:15.45]They're falling in love.
[120:16.79]They're falling in love.
[120:18.05]Oh, here we go.
[120:18.86]Oh, big.
[120:19.90]Kill him!
[120:20.68]Kill him!
[120:21.54]Yeah!
[120:22.26]Unbelievable.
[120:23.24]Jason Mraz.
[120:25.85]Man, that shit's too real.
[120:28.59]He just said real and then he stopped fighting.
[120:30.83]He just hanged out.
[120:33.92]I'm just going to keep it real.
[120:35.64]And he just didn't even decide to fight anymore.
[120:39.33]Real?
[120:39.49]What does real even mean?
[120:41.07]We're all just clueless and just said it.
[120:43.93]Look at the hell's that.
[120:46.14]Good luck.
[120:49.80]I wanted to do that again.
[120:52.65]oh no that is fun real real real real real real real real real means it says it tends to hide its true abilities
[121:19.54]What?
[121:20.36]Oh, I mean, still doesn't make any sense.
[121:22.58]I don't know.
[121:25.72]But it's like playing hard to get or something.
[121:30.41]That's very cool.
[121:31.01]Fortune cookie.
[121:35.23]Alright.
[121:35.77]Now we got a Ster versus.
[121:41.06]Vinny, it looks like.
[121:44.46]Ster and Vinny.
[121:45.92]Oh, Ster and squeak.
[121:47.46]Oh.
[121:48.60]Oh.
[121:49.57]oh oh you didn't go back I think we do a back to back here because that would prevent us needing to do it later right I think I think that's how it works apparently real is raises all your monsters stats temporarily but once it wears uh wears off it lowers all of them I don't know that's real are these like are these innate to the monsters like there's no training that causes like real or whatever I think so okay
[122:15.63]I think you just roll lucky to get it.
[122:17.71]Yeah, like you got grit and whatever the other one was.
[122:20.99]Yeah, I think my little pup has power.
[122:25.38]Alright, here we go.
[122:26.88]You can't learn to be real.
[122:28.24]You're just born with it.
[122:29.04]Yeah.
[122:31.57]I'm can I I'm dude, everybody in my chat and all chats across the world, by the way, should all be hoping that Ster goes goose egg here.

[124:41.26]You could tell.
[124:42.86]No, wait a second.
[124:45.29]Oh, shit.

[124:46.27]This would be humiliating.

[124:56.77]Keep it up.
[124:57.65]I'm yours.
[124:59.23]Dodge, dodge, dodge.
[125:01.05]Keep the speed up.
[125:01.65]Yes, kill him.
[125:04.48]You got this.
[125:05.10]You got the guts.
[125:06.66]Punch, punch, punch.
[125:07.28]You're fast.
[125:07.64]You're fast.
[125:08.08]Do something.
[125:08.56]What is Jason Mraz doing?
[125:10.56]He could have done it.
[125:12.45]He just had to press a button.
[125:15.53]My little baby.
[125:16.37]Thank god.
[125:17.71]Jason.
[125:19.46]Jason Derulo.
[125:22.59]Alright, Ster.
[125:24.05]That was a really good, to be fair, Ster, you had two really good matches.
[125:27.76]They've been great matches.
[125:29.10]Let me be clear.
[125:30.26]Yes.
[125:30.66]It was saying it wanted to evolve into a Raichu, and I just kept not letting it.
[125:34.89]I think if I let it change, it would have won.
[125:38.15]Wait, they can evolve?
[125:41.08]Why the fuck did Brokeboy say something like that?
[125:45.16]They can't evolve.
[125:47.37]They can't evolve.
[125:49.81]The hell?
[125:50.55]Two years?
[125:50.87]You don't want Brokeboy to evolve, though.
[125:53.09]For two years, he stayed like that.
[125:54.65]Come on.
[125:55.21]You're happy with Brokeboy.
[125:56.88]You're sweet.
[125:57.46]Let's take a look at the standings.
[125:58.36]Yeah, I like the worm.
[126:00.54]Yeah, me too.
[126:04.01]We currently have StirwithOwen2, VinnyOwen1, and then we've got... I've got more than anyone.
[126:14.11]Alright, now we're going to, I believe, poke and poke and meet.
[126:24.17]Oh, shit.
[126:25.23]I think that works.
[126:26.05]That's a scary match.
[126:27.17]That's going to be crazy.
[126:30.98]Alright, here we go.
[126:32.20]Let's put these monsters in.
[126:39.05]I am afraid of your character because he has so, so much damage.
[126:46.77]Yeah, but very low speed and kill.
[126:49.06]I haven't had this person go up against anybody that's really powerful though.
[126:53.22]That's not like a dig at Ster.
[126:57.73]I'm just saying he didn't have high power.
[126:59.99]That's not what I was trying to say.
[127:01.51]Alright, I'll get in there.
[127:08.14]Sorry, what?
[127:09.16]Wait, I thought it was Brian Chug.
[127:10.88]Wait a second.
[127:12.50]What is the beast's name?
[127:14.71]Wait a minute.
[127:15.37]Brian?
[127:16.93]His name's Brian.
[127:19.27]Oh, okay.
[127:19.75]I thought I misheard you then.
[127:21.04]It must have been the wind.
[127:23.04]You're so smart.
[127:24.94]That intellect.
[127:27.44]My health is so low.
[127:28.43]If I get hit by anything, I'm just done.
[127:31.01]Yeah, but you have enough speed and... Oh, shit.
[127:35.47]I might dodge everything.
[127:37.15]I'm going to miss everything I mean.
[127:38.57]I'm going to miss.
[127:40.15]One hit is the end of, I think, both of our characters.
[127:43.69]Although, I don't think so.
[127:45.56]Wait, I'm okay.
[127:46.46]Yeah, you're done.
[127:47.32]Sorry.
[127:48.70]It's over for you.
[127:50.66]I was just being nice.
[127:52.44]Let's go.
[127:56.73]Eye beam.
[127:58.19]Oh, the dodge.
[127:59.17]Holy shit.
[128:00.41]Fast reactions.
[128:01.73]You know how many rocks I had to dodge?
[128:04.29]Oh.
[128:05.31]807 damage?
[128:07.63]Dead.
[128:08.65]Brian Chug is dead.
[128:10.26]Jesus.
[128:11.20]You had a 31% chance to hit that.
[128:14.42]And you crushed me.
[128:17.58]That's why I'm never getting laser eye surgery.
[128:19.78]I'm so sorry.
[128:21.79]God damn it.
[128:25.81]Come on, here we go.
[128:27.43]Shouldn't Brian Chug be dead?
[128:31.55]Oh, come on.
[128:32.28]No, no, it didn't kill him.
[128:33.18]He lived?
[128:33.80]He lived through it.
[128:34.54]Oh, whoa.
[128:35.84]Stomp him!
[128:36.90]Just do anything!
[128:37.42]Bite!
[128:37.72]Bite!
[128:38.84]No!
[128:39.77]Yes!
[128:42.89]I eat the eye.
[128:44.15]Shit!
[128:44.74]I thought I was gonna one-hit kill you with the beam.
[128:48.72]Good fight.
[128:50.21]Good fight.
[128:51.25]Damn.
[128:51.71]Oh, Poke, this is, um... You got a good one here.
[128:56.04]No drugs either.
[128:57.59]drug free that's crazy I think we do drug tests I don't know that shit that power being so high is crazy I want to know your regiment I literally did the there's that page that shows the regiment I can show you oh you googled Reddit on this one alright no I swear I did it alright now we go uh kriken versus vinny I'm scared I'm ready I am ready I'm I'm gonna be cheering my monster on

[129:28.07]Has my little monster fellow been the only one to actually damage himself so far?
[129:32.90]Yes.
[129:34.10]Oh, Rick.
[129:40.05]Oh, no.
[129:41.47]Oh, jeez.
[129:42.37]Everybody, at the same time, do your best Morty impression.
[129:45.98]It has to be at the same exact time.
[129:47.98]Is Morty the grandpa?
[129:49.23]Uh, Morty is the kid.
[129:51.01]Oh.
[129:51.95]I love this rig.
[129:53.23]The daughter rig is the kid.

[130:01.06]Awww, jeez!
[130:03.32]Oh my god!
[130:05.52]I don't even know about this one, Rick!
[130:07.51]Uh, congratulations everybody.
[130:09.83]We just all collectively lost like three to five thousand viewers permanently.
[130:14.73]Fuck.
[130:15.37]That's more than I have.
[130:16.65]What the fuck?
[130:20.71]God damn it.
[130:22.42]Negative numbers.
[130:23.92]Negative.
[130:24.92]Somebody said I muted.
[130:26.04]People said they muted for 10 seconds.
[130:28.86]How about Rick?
[130:29.35]Can we do Rick too?
[130:29.99]If I were watching, I would have muted.
[130:31.81]I would have definitely.
[130:32.57]I would have too.
[130:33.17]I would have muted too.
[130:34.13]Alright.
[130:34.45]How about Rick?
[130:35.15]Just one.
[130:36.30]How about Rick?
[130:37.34]Quick Rick.
[130:38.24]Quick Rick.
[130:39.30]Quick Rick.
[130:40.60]One, two, three.
[130:43.57]I feel like four of us didn't do anything and two of us did it for real and one of us tried really hard it was me but then I got speech jammed by everybody else
[131:04.41]Everyone your best Marge ready three two one go Can you please do that again, but just everybody pretend that he's sitting on the toilet oh
[131:35.73]Just do what you just did again.
[131:37.25]Homie, you ate all the food, homie.
[131:40.01]Homie, you ate all the dinner.
[131:42.67]This is getting weird.
[131:44.54]One more time.
[131:45.58]Press begin battle.
[131:46.56]Press it.
[131:50.62]Well, I'm glad we had that little halftime show, I guess.
[131:52.67]That was great.
[131:53.35]Yeah, that was better than any musical.
[131:55.07]Yeah, these Super Bowl shows are getting worse.
[131:57.17]Oh, my God.
[131:59.83]Why'd you do this to yourself?
[132:02.39]My Dodge character he might just keep jumping I
[132:24.28]What is he even trying to do with that?
[132:25.82]He's trying to smush the other guy.
[132:26.98]I don't know.
[132:27.94]And if he misses, he just dies.
[132:29.72]He's jumping so short.
[132:30.94]He's not even close to the other guy.
[132:32.94]Yeah, not even close, dude.
[132:35.43]It's just his picture drooling that really gets me.
[132:37.83]It's just actually drooling.
[132:39.09]And by the way, this album is so not what Gormfield looks like.
[132:43.27]You know, you listen to Soundgarden and it's not this.
[132:46.28]It's very disappointing.
[132:48.24]It is bad.
[132:49.56]Wait, Gormfield is a real word?
[132:52.24]Good point.
[132:54.01]Wait, what's that?
[132:55.09]Poke?
[132:55.79]Gormfield is a real word?
[132:57.65]No, I'll explain.
[132:58.46]I'll explain.
[132:58.94]So Gormless is a word that the Brits use for someone who's like kind of dumb.
[133:06.33]What?
[133:07.23]Ew.
[133:07.91]What does that do?
[133:10.11]He's gonna do it.
[133:10.91]He's gonna jump.
[133:11.80]He's gonna kill himself.
[133:13.30]He's gonna kill himself.
[133:15.38]Oh!
[133:15.70]Yeah, Gormfield.
[133:17.30]Gormfield.
[133:19.25]Oh!
[133:19.57]Oh!
[133:22.83]This is sad.
[133:23.59]He's been laughing his whole time.
[133:25.76]And you've been so long training him.
[133:29.72]Oh my god, that's funny.
[133:30.68]So yeah, gormless is a word, but gorm is not a word.
[133:33.63]So no one, you have to kind of trace back.
[133:37.03]I say gormful sometimes just because gormful is a fun word to say.
[133:41.09]But gormless, I've used gormless.
[133:43.56]I called Donkey Kong Country 3 character gormless.
[133:48.63]So that should give you an example of what I think it means.
[133:50.74]Lacking sense or initiative.
[133:52.96]Foolish.
[133:54.94]So, yeah.
[133:57.06]Okay.
[133:57.92]Okay.
[133:58.20]So now we're back to one.
[134:00.89]Who hasn't gone?
[134:01.63]Who hasn't gone in a while?
[134:02.47]It's been me, right?
[134:04.67]Me and Ster.
[134:06.17]Oh, no, no, no.
[134:06.57]I mean, sir, me and just go last round.
[134:11.26]No idea.
[134:11.74]Right.
[134:14.22]I think poke and Ster or poke and squeaks.
[134:20.11]Ster is definitely in this one here.
[134:22.09]Just do one.
[134:22.91]You know what I'm saying?
[134:23.61]Just do it.
[134:24.89]It doesn't matter.
[134:25.51]We're going to get it all done.
[134:26.65]We'll do Poke and Squeaks.
[134:29.06]Oh, no.
[134:30.76]I'm scared of Poke's monster.
[134:43.45]Poke, you and Criken are currently winning.
[134:50.21]Winning.
[134:50.61]I'm ready.
[134:54.04]Alright, here we go.
[134:54.56]Yeah, but you have to get through me first.
[134:56.78]What's my monster?
[134:57.58]Mraskito.
[134:58.88]You're not even looking at me.
[135:02.75]The disrespect.
[135:04.45]I'm busy.
[135:05.39]You're looking at the audience.
[135:08.05]You're guys looking at us.
[135:14.14]Here we go.
[135:16.16]Wait, this is a close matchup, actually.
[135:17.57]Hold on.
[135:18.03]This is a good matchup.
[135:19.36]Oh, wow.
[135:19.74]Yeah.
[135:20.63]Oh, shit.
[135:21.91]A defense might come in handy.
[135:24.79]The speed from poke, I think, might help him out.
[135:27.37]76 speed is tough.
[135:29.01]I did do a lot of running.
[135:30.25]I did do a lot of... It was that one workout for speed.
[135:33.64]I think poke takes this.
[135:34.58]I think this is pokes.
[135:35.12]I think so, too.
[135:35.86]My Mosquito kept dying.
[135:37.48]I had to keep relaunching my save.
[135:39.96]Wait, what was his... Yo, Squeak says the longest... Squeak says eight hours.
[135:44.41]Wait, wait, wait.
[135:45.53]Your stats are even, but one of you killed it with drugs and one of you didn't use drugs poke.
[135:51.80]I have the whole VOD.
[135:52.85]I'll show you the whole VOD.
[135:54.55]Wow.
[135:54.65]Procedure.
[135:55.43]I swear there was no drugs.
[135:59.26]I have the whole VOD.
[136:01.74]I swear, guys, I promise.
[136:03.32]Because Squeaks, your character made it to one year, eight months and would not live another day after that.
[136:10.15]Anything I would do on that day would kill him.
[136:12.98]even sleeping tablets any sleeping I did uh what's it called troron or whatever trory or whatever that is do that every single month I fade I fed my guy tablets only only drug like the tablets yep wait yeah that sounds like a drug well here we go it's just advil it's advil oh okay let's see we'll allow that drugs are drug free come on drugs
[136:42.43]Oh, here we go.
[136:44.15]Whoa.
[136:46.78]I love what they boo.
[136:48.56]So mean.
[136:50.96]Oh, wow.
[136:53.49]Oh, what a devastating loss.
[136:57.45]Okay, drug free wins.
[136:58.73]That's weird.
[136:59.63]Yeah, I wouldn't take drugs if I was like created in a lab.
[137:03.38]Don't do drugs.
[137:05.34]I love it.
[137:05.62]That's weird.
[137:07.03]That is weird.
[137:07.95]Usually drugs win.
[137:09.05]It's like the MLB.
[137:10.24]Guys, I feel like there's a lot of drama and tension here.
[137:12.58]I'm not doing drugs.
[137:13.82]I swear.
[137:14.46]You know, the more you say it, the more I don't believe you, Poke.
[137:20.73]Everyone's looking at me weird.
[137:21.79]I'm not on drugs.
[137:28.98]Oh, my God.
[137:30.32]That did nothing.
[137:34.13]He learned.
[137:35.91]Oh, the dodge.
[137:36.91]Wait a second.
[137:37.55]That's the whole combo.
[137:40.88]Does his own just hits.
[137:43.65]Oh, what an answer.
[137:46.49]The killing blow.
[137:48.51]FaceTime.
[137:49.11]Kill him.
[137:53.20]Alright.
[137:53.84]Let's see.
[137:55.00]It's a hiding factor.
[137:55.88]Alright.
[137:58.56]Drugs wins.
[137:59.30]Let's go drugs.
[138:00.49]Come on.
[138:01.15]Finish it.
[138:02.41]Game three.
[138:04.99]Huge win.
[138:07.79]Here we go.
[138:08.78]Pow, pow, pow.
[138:12.44]That slam move, you're queuing it up.
[138:15.91]Oh!
[138:16.97]What's my guy walking into it?
[138:18.91]No!
[138:21.37]You can't take the combo.
[138:22.80]You can't take a combo, man.
[138:24.14]Sorry.
[138:24.60]You're right.
[138:25.98]God, I feel so stupid for believing I could win.
[138:30.81]Drugs are bad.
[138:35.92]Damn it.
[138:36.50]Nice job, Poke.
[138:37.04]Poke, you are 3-0.
[138:40.30]Nuts oil, first day, second day, mint leaf.
[138:43.99]Nuts oil, third day, fourth day, mint leaf.
[138:50.57]Yeah, you got that regimen.
[138:51.91]That's the good regimen.
[138:54.54]And it's natural.
[138:55.22]Alright, Vinny, it looks like you and me.
[138:56.94]Or me and Criken.
[138:58.64]No, no, no, I'm sorry.
[139:01.69]Yeah, I think that might be me and Vinny.
[139:04.95]And then Criken, you'll go against Ster.
[139:07.79]Yeah, I'm ready.
[139:10.49]I want to see Gormfield kill himself in the first second.
[139:13.52]I know.
[139:14.38]It's funny because he looks so grumpy, too.
[139:21.67]I don't know why.
[139:22.57]He almost did it, too.
[139:25.47]That would be so awesome if he did.
[139:28.58]Has he landed one of those hits yet?
[139:30.92]Did he just say they're sad with his guitar?
[139:36.33]Gormfield has disappointed me so much.
[139:39.68]Honestly, I don't even know what that move is trying to do.
[139:45.61]I don't know the point of it.
[139:48.09]Maybe it does a ton of damage?
[139:49.74]Other people do runs and stuff, and they don't hurt themselves.
[139:54.14]Why does Gorn feel so dumb?
[139:56.64]Gorn feels actually kind of hard.
[140:00.51]Yeah.
[140:01.19]Oh yeah, he does have some int.
[140:03.43]I'm not going to be able to one-hit kill you.
[140:05.51]I think you got this.
[140:07.96]I think Brian Shark did one-hit.
[140:11.22]All Gormfield has to do is jump in the wrong direction.
[140:13.49]He's dead.
[140:14.05]So, I mean, you might win.
[140:16.55]Come on, let's go.
[140:17.87]Let's do it.
[140:21.95]Oh.
[140:26.52]He sucks so bad.
[140:28.82]Frame one.
[140:29.96]Frame one fries him.
[140:32.02]That was insane.
[140:32.94]Dude, I... Close match, man.
[140:35.34]Honestly, I think the referee might... That might have been before the whistle.
[140:38.93]Yeah, it looked like it.
[140:41.63]Illegal match.
[140:43.77]Alright, come on, Gormfield, please.
[140:45.60]I taught you so much.
[140:47.24]I was there for your birth, I really was.
[140:49.56]And I trained him.
[140:50.34]He was the one I trained the most.
[140:51.84]Back to back.
[140:52.24]Oh, that's why he sucks.
[140:54.40]Oh!
[140:55.21]Good dodge!
[140:56.09]Here we go!
[140:56.71]Diving press!
[140:57.51]He's gonna do it.
[140:58.35]Here we go!
[140:59.05]Yes!
[141:00.97]Do it again!
[141:01.77]You're gonna kill yourself.
[141:03.55]You fucking dipshit.
[141:04.29]Oh, I spit in your face!
[141:05.58]He spat at him!
[141:08.24]Ew!
[141:08.40]I know!
[141:08.78]Don't kiss him!
[141:10.30]Come on, come on, do something, do something.
[141:12.47]Oh my god, dude.
[141:15.67]Dude, you need to stop.
[141:18.13]Stop doing any, stop attacking.
[141:20.12]Oh my god!
[141:22.50]Oh my god!
[141:24.30]What the hell is this?
[141:25.78]Kill yourself.
[141:26.59]Tease on him.
[141:27.39]Wait, wait, this is insane.
[141:30.83]Don't do diving press.
[141:33.32]Don't do diving press.
[141:34.40]He's gonna kill himself.
[141:36.34]Oh, he's gonna kiss!
[141:37.42]What is happening?
[141:38.35]Ew!
[141:40.35]What was that?
[141:41.03]What the fuck?
[141:43.14]This might be the most insane- Oh, the sweetest thing!
[141:48.55]Oh, yes!
[141:49.67]That was insane.
[141:51.20]20 seconds of nothing.
[141:52.62]It was one HP.
[141:53.24]That was insane.
[141:54.16]Can I point out that his dirt kick brought you to one HP, not from grit.
[141:59.19]So that was actually like just one HP away from killing you.
[142:03.28]And let me tell you, the last day of training, the last day that he, about one year and 11 months, I trained life.
[142:13.31]Wow.
[142:14.41]Wow.
[142:15.38]What does that do?
[142:18.14]I know.
[142:18.78]I know.
[142:19.08]I'm kidding.
[142:20.18]I got you.
[142:22.46]Wait, that was the best match of the day.
[142:25.65]That was amazing.
[142:27.37]I don't know why Brian, Mr. Chug is kissing himself.
[142:31.79]Did you see that move?
[142:34.28]He just makes contact with his own tail.
[142:37.12]It's weird.
[142:38.56]I don't know why he's doing that.
[142:39.50]He starts making out with his tail.
[142:42.05]Can only the eye do that?
[142:45.16]I don't know.
[142:45.74]Maybe.
[142:46.82]I think it's just like the eye.
[142:48.76]I don't know.
[142:50.61]Alright.
[142:51.19]Next, Criken and Ster.
[142:53.93]The fact that Gormfield would have won, I think, if he didn't hit himself twice is even more sad.
[143:00.74]Two belly swabs.
[143:02.02]He wouldn't want to be attacked again.
[143:03.84]Gentlemen, can you break the game so next time any monster could get any move?
[143:11.03]I think I'm saying I think you can I think there is like that there's cheat tables for this I don't know how how it all works but I know it exists come on dude can you become a monster enter modder alright this is gonna be a big one for you sir if there is a next time I love this yeah this rules we'll talk about this we'll talk about it yeah it's been a lot of fun I'm glad it's been fun
[143:38.70]I'm so happy I trained real hard for it.
[143:43.32]If we do this again, I'll get in there.
[143:46.79]I'll get my hands dirty.
[143:50.94]I loved I tuned into Ster stream while he was training this little guy and every day he would just go and play with him in the field and then there would be an opportunity to actually learn something and he's like no you can rest you can sleep it was just it was adorable and really I don't know he asked me to play every week and I always said yes and I let him win every time except once
[144:12.94]So he deserves to win this.
[144:15.24]He deserves to be rooted for.
[144:17.31]He's not a warrior.
[144:18.97]I think he doesn't belong here.
[144:22.01]He just kept shaking his little butt.
[144:23.60]He had this little dance animation.
[144:26.70]He's very nice.
[144:27.94]And he's going to get killed by a lobster.
[144:29.67]Very high skill on Vladabussy.
[144:35.07]Good pronunciation.
[144:35.98]Very good.
[144:37.00]So that might completely negate your speed, Ster.
[144:40.06]But we'll find out.
[144:43.13]I'm not my monster.
[144:45.88]You trained it.
[144:48.06]Yeah, but it's not my speed.
[144:49.04]Alright.
[144:50.66]Alright.
[144:50.94]Just killed like the fun mascot.
[144:54.31]Death Scythe.
[144:56.51]This is where in like one of the talent shows on TV, they show the whole backstory and how sad and like inspiring it is.
[145:01.98]And he walks out and you Death Scythe it once.
[145:05.44]honestly this this is even more like you were the mascot coming out with the t-shirt cannon and this guy just decided to kill you this is an actual monster I did not I don't know who this is they just let him loose on the can you mod blood into this when you're doing your mod as well yeah true get the Jerma mod ready alright let's do it good oh cool oh not dead yet
[145:35.68]Oh, okay.
[145:37.91]Alright, there you go, little buddy.
[145:40.13]Punch him a hundred times, come on.
[145:49.04]I just want to make sure everyone knows the, the two t-shirts that did make it into the audience.
[145:53.87]Uh, there are coupon codes on the back.
[145:56.47]We thought it would be a fun thing to put that on the, on the Jersey.
[145:59.02]We were shooting out into the, into the crowd there.
[146:02.02]Uh, it is 20% off of the merch store.
[146:05.23]Uh, we'll go ahead and get him out of here.
[146:06.45]Um, let's get him out on the cart.
[146:09.25]He comes out.
[146:09.99]Yeah.
[146:10.37]Lifts him up one limited time.
[146:14.04]Is there a kiss cam?
[146:16.82]We don't do that anymore.
[146:18.96]Just making out with his own tail.
[146:20.69]Yeah.
[146:22.15]He gets caught and he just hides.
[146:23.41]He's like, oh, shit.
[146:24.81]Yeah.
[146:26.07]Oh, that's funny.
[146:28.42]Alright.
[146:28.64]Congratulations, Criken.
[146:30.54]Thanks.
[146:31.12]I felt really bad about that one, I'll be honest.
[146:32.90]You saw the whole, like, you saw the training regimen.
[146:37.09]I saw the connection you made with him and I wish I had that with this.
[146:41.30]This one was a bastard to train.
[146:42.54]He cheated on every freaking thing.
[146:44.68]I had to, like...
[146:46.39]I had to really get in line with my little guy you saw he would do great like hit the perfect in training on every set like consistently and then it'd be like +2 speed I don't know what his deal was yeah I think it always goes up slow every monster has a kind of
[147:08.31]like oh you scale a in speed or c or d it's kind of like he was getting like plus 20 intelligence as a punch guy yeah well yeah he had no intelligence moves but he just was really smart but I just let him do it anyway because he liked it
[147:25.20]Did you guys ever get, like, great training?
[147:27.42]Have you ever seen that?
[147:28.66]I don't know what spawned that.
[147:29.96]Was it just because they're in a good mood?
[147:31.71]I think it's the nature of the monster as well.
[147:33.71]If you have a bad-natured monster, they will cheat.
[147:36.47]If you have a good-natured monster or a, I think, competitive nature, there's a lot of different ways that they will or won't do it.
[147:42.30]You could have a perfect nature where they just won't ever do it.
[147:45.73]But Rogue Boy kept cheating.
[147:47.39]I had to slap the fuck out of him.
[147:48.77]Rogue Boy was a cheater too?
[147:50.05]Yeah.
[147:51.13]I had to scold the fuck out of him.
[147:52.15]I had to scold him.
[147:52.86]Squeaks and Vinny is coming up next.
[147:57.62]Alright.
[147:58.00]I can't wait to fight Ster's guide, too.
[148:00.06]That's going to be fun.
[148:02.95]I'm just taking terms beating up the mascot, dude.
[148:06.13]The cute creature.
[148:09.09]I built this guy.
[148:09.89]I trained him so he could follow a protagonist around and go, meh.
[148:14.42]That's what he would do after.
[148:16.78]Whenever you tell him to do something, his character goes, meh, and does a shrug.
[148:21.90]hey I don't know where you're going but I got a tutorial for you that would be my in my game that would be the character it would say stuff like that unskippable look at his teeth the dragon's teeth don't look at my dragon
[148:41.30]He needs to be wearing the broken nerd glasses with the tape in the middle.
[148:45.67]Yeah, he's got an overbite.
[148:46.91]You're right.
[148:48.15]He's got a really beautiful overbite.
[148:50.16]We made that picture.
[148:51.60]There's other dragons.
[148:53.56]They look so much cooler.
[148:54.62]We talked about your dragon every time he shows up.
[148:59.51]The picture.
[149:00.53]Yeah, well, hopefully Gormfield kills himself in this fight.
[149:04.74]We are all rooting for him to win.
[149:06.78]It's crazy we're all rooting for that.
[149:07.88]Like, yeah, come on, jump and die!
[149:09.89]We're all just rooting for him.
[149:11.09]At this point, I am too, honestly.
[149:12.63]It'll at least be funny.
[149:14.19]Go Gormfield!
[149:14.67]Gormfield has so much speed.
[149:16.16]You guys ever notice that?
[149:17.40]He does.
[149:18.92]Oh, here he goes.
[149:19.68]Oh, wow.
[149:20.66]Oh, not a big hit that time.
[149:21.87]Damn.
[149:22.27]Alright, well, that's nice.
[149:23.11]He didn't actually almost kill.
[149:25.69]Okay.
[149:29.40]Cool.
[149:34.36]Okay, we got a fight here.
[149:36.07]That never hit.
[149:39.55]Here we go.
[149:42.22]Are we getting division with pilots?
[149:45.04]That is like the worst move.
[149:46.70]It's never once hit.
[149:48.36]Oh, wow.
[149:52.41]Squeaks, damn.
[149:54.67]Alright, we still got some legs on this one.
[149:57.24]Not bad.
[149:58.17]It should be noted, once again, that this is the monster I trained the most.
[150:03.56]Take from that what you will.
[150:05.58]I just feel like the monster's nature is bad.
[150:08.10]Like, why does he even have a move that hurts him so much?
[150:11.51]Gormfield would be so cracked if not for his self-destructive behaviors.
[150:16.91]Why is Gormfield not happy?
[150:18.82]Someone said, remember when his best move was sneezing.
[150:21.21]I do remember that, yeah.
[150:23.11]Yeah, he... That was when I first started training him, he would sneeze.
[150:26.44]So at least these are better, I guess.
[150:27.72]His tongue slap?
[150:29.79]Yeah, that one actually was good.
[150:32.53]That's his only good move.
[150:34.88]Oh, here we go!
[150:35.98]He went back to normal!
[150:37.54]Nice, man!
[150:39.01]No!
[150:40.05]He got it!
[150:40.55]He landed it!
[150:41.63]Wait, he landed it!
[150:43.01]No!
[150:43.45]It's the kill squish!
[150:45.74]600 damage?
[150:47.46]Was that 600?
[150:50.22]Wait, that's insane.
[150:52.24]Wait, that's the best move in the game!
[150:54.99]You just have to almost kill yourself 20 times.
[150:57.37]Right.
[150:58.35]It was worth it.
[151:00.17]Alright, wait.
[151:00.71]Here we go.
[151:01.87]Now this is a match.
[151:03.50]Yeah, Squeaks, we got a good match going in here.
[151:06.53]Right.
[151:07.03]The camera shy dragon versus the gormless cat.
[151:10.88]Yeah, it was making eye contact with the camera.
[151:13.94]He's not drooling.
[151:16.49]He's going to eat us.
[151:17.27]Alright, come on.
[151:21.60]I need this win.
[151:23.96]I need this win.
[151:33.20]He heard you.
[151:33.84]Look at his smile.
[151:36.20]His evil little grin when he won.
[151:38.02]He's so happy.
[151:40.05]He's a devil character.
[151:41.49]That's insane.
[151:43.71]I'm terrified if he does that to me now.
[151:45.97]I'm fucking scared.
[151:48.88]Lasagna.
[151:50.76]Nice job, Vinny.
[151:52.35]Is it me or Gormfield has become the scariest guy to fight now?
[151:59.02]Honestly, I'm glad I already fought him.
[152:01.27]He was a joke for a while, but he's done being a joke.
[152:05.82]Yeah, we talked a lot of shit.
[152:07.62]character development.
[152:09.08]How do you kill a monster that's willing to kill himself?
[152:11.91]That's true.
[152:13.57]Alright, Criken, me and you.
[152:16.39]Yeah.
[152:17.30]Alright.
[152:18.04]This is a must-win scenario for my character.
[152:21.68]You are undefeated.
[152:28.56]I have to pull out all the stops.
[152:35.82]If my character has low int, does your int do more damage to me?
[152:39.62]It does.
[152:40.00]Okay, then this could be anyone's game, because I have a dumb little guy.
[152:44.73]Int is the defense and attack stat for int moves.
[152:50.42]Okay.
[152:50.54]That's why defense is not... Oh, defense!
[152:54.27]You would think it was like defense to everything.
[152:56.45]It is not to int moves.
[153:01.69]Here we go.
[153:02.69]Mine has a subspecies of Joker.
[153:05.69]He's all sorts of twisted.
[153:08.34]Your speed is very bad.
[153:09.92]Do you guys see Joker cars in real life, or am I the only one?
[153:14.87]Joker cars?
[153:17.13]No, I'll have to send you some pictures.
[153:19.51]I'll have to send you some pictures, but I've seen three Joker cars in my life, including one today.
[153:24.45]What's a Joker car?
[153:25.37]Yeah, what is that?
[153:26.11]It's the first one I saw was on the Brooklyn Queens Expressway, and I had pictures of the Joker all over it, including a Joker action figure.
[153:33.78]Oh, my God.
[153:34.36]I've also been seeing Joker cars with just like one Joker or two.
[153:38.43]So I just want to let you know there are Joker cars in the world.
[153:40.91]There's like a sliding scale of Joker in the cars out there.
[153:44.51]yeah there it's weird dude I'll send you some I'll post some pictures hang on I I'm I'm very curious about this uh I will I will definitely take a look at that after uh my one sorry sorry go ahead yeah yeah yeah yeah let's go Brian come on Brian beam him no oh it was one shot same oh wait what a what a twist I was so worried of this

[154:23.37]Come on, Brian.
[154:26.01]If Brian doesn't hit the early laser, it's going to be tough.
[154:29.24]I feel like Claw is pretty.
[154:30.76]What are you doing?
[154:31.44]Oh, no, don't kiss him.
[154:33.26]Do the laser beam.
[154:35.47]Oh, he's kissing himself like a man.

[155:42.43]I thought I had you there.
[155:47.55]What are they putting in this lasagna?
[155:51.42]Criken, you are... Criken, this is looking like a potential clean sweep.
[156:00.59]Me and Poker are still undefeated, right?
[156:02.25]You are 4-0 right now.
[156:07.01]That's a weird Joker car.
[156:08.80]poke and Ster next this is this is badass that's the jokerist of the joker cards I've ever seen just to let you know I've seen like it's yeah there is a sliding scale cracking hot toxic hahaha yeah uh poke this is another anime car I have yeah I've seen I see those all all the time wait who am I fighting wrong wrong wrong I copied the wrong code
[156:38.93]uh poke if you win this you are also tied for first let's go I need I need this you're gonna win but you're gonna feel bad about it well I'm not really because I went zero and five now once you see the last little death and they'll whimper come out of this little creature's face what the are you doing this is gonna be sad
[157:06.02]I need this.
[157:07.28]This might be sad, but it could... It could be... I don't know.
[157:11.41]I think Poke is just gonna clean sweep the whole thing.
[157:13.59]He's only two years old.
[157:14.87]Don't do it.
[157:15.89]He has a lot of skill and speed, though.
[157:18.26]I feel like you guys are gonna knock the fuck out of me with, like, 20 punches in a row.
[157:23.20]I just feel like it's gonna happen.
[157:26.37]Let's see.
[157:36.58]Hey, come on, chill out, he's just a little guy.
[157:42.99]Poke, you have a terrible hit percentage here.
[157:44.79]14%.
[157:45.79]I might time him out.
[157:48.66]It's so cute.
[157:49.42]You could time him out.
[157:50.84]Unless he gets this bite.
[157:51.86]Oh, wait a second.
[157:53.99]12%.
[157:54.57]Stop punching me!
[157:58.33]These animations are so long, too.
[158:00.62]I told you this would happen.
[158:02.14]Timer scam, timer scam.
[158:03.96]Wait.
[158:05.10]17 percent wow oh my god is this really happening come on come on just eat him yes oh wait oh no no you can still punch me down I don't know look at him hopping he's slow oh no oh it's out of time you get tired defeated
[158:31.57]That was after the buzzer.
[158:32.64]Whoa, he tried to punch after the fucking match was over.
[158:35.38]Get the ref.
[158:41.40]That could have... Hey, we just saw it happen.
[158:44.47]It could happen again right now.
[158:46.89]BM?
[158:47.55]Oh yeah, that's BM.
[158:52.11]Damn.
[158:54.32]That was closer than I thought.
[158:56.28]I'm a believer.
[158:58.22]I believe that Ster could run this back here.
[159:03.06]Oh, that would have been good timing.
[159:07.91]Come on, go for a big, go for like a 30% chance.
[159:10.53]Yeah, bite him.
[159:12.17]Oh, no.
[159:12.61]Oh, my God.
[159:14.11]He has 100 mana.
[159:14.88]99 guts.
[159:16.40]Do something.
[159:19.08]Okay.
[159:20.06]He's got the comedy noises.
[159:22.74]He does the Mickey Mouse sounds.
[159:24.97]Nice, nice.
[159:26.63]Poke is building his mana back.
[159:29.21]How am I missing just as much as him with like 70%?
[159:32.90]Here we go.
[159:34.24]We're in a flick combo.
[159:36.32]The animation takes forever.
[159:37.57]It takes so long to do it.
[159:38.93]It really does.
[159:39.89]It's cheating the timer.
[159:42.15]Dude.
[159:42.79]Oh.
[159:43.90]Oh.
[159:44.54]Oh, god.
[159:45.06]It's so close.
[159:45.86]Come on, little guy.
[159:47.32]Oh, my god.
[159:47.74]Look at him go.
[159:48.66]The big combo.
[159:49.60]The timer's low.
[159:50.23]The timer, man.
[159:51.23]I'm going to lose.
[159:52.07]I'm going to hit him.
[159:53.01]Flick, flick.
[159:53.47]Oh, my god.
[159:54.47]Oh, my god.
[159:55.13]The animation is really happening.
[159:56.42]Wait.
[159:56.68]What's happening?
[159:57.52]I think it's happening.
[159:58.58]Run, run, run.
[159:59.88]That's it.
[160:00.42]Oh, my God.
[160:02.38]Oh, post.
[160:02.82]After the beat.
[160:03.44]He's cheating.
[160:04.12]He won.
[160:05.30]The little guy won.
[160:06.39]Actually did it with 100% health.
[160:09.41]That's crazy.
[160:10.29]Damn.
[160:10.85]Damn.
[160:11.89]I'm freaking out.
[160:12.51]Down to a tiebreaker.
[160:14.78]I'm freaking out.
[160:17.66]Secret piece.
[160:18.14]Alright.
[160:18.84]Come here.
[160:19.64]This is a massive deal, Poke.
[160:22.62]You have to win this.
[160:24.23]I know.
[160:24.71]I'm going to trample him.
[160:26.58]I know.
[160:27.60]He looks like a Labubu.
[160:30.04]He does look like a Labubu.
[160:31.60]He does, almost exactly.
[160:36.53]Turn him into Dubai chocolate!
[160:41.18]I love the front flip and back flip with everything he does.
[160:44.28]Oh shit!
[160:44.90]That was high.
[160:46.44]That was a 47!
[160:47.80]Ah!
[160:48.85]Oh my god!
[160:51.59]He's got realness in his DNA.
[160:55.03]Real.
[160:56.73]real oh my god he's hitting so much this takes so long it's just one hit 20 oh my god oh my god oh my god dude
[161:21.88]Alright dude for next tournament everybody build a 500 speed
[161:48.52]Poor Poke, dude.
[161:51.55]Brokeboy crawled so he could fucking fly here.
[161:54.27]Wow.
[161:55.25]Scammed by a little monkey.
[161:56.63]Brokeboy would have won this.
[161:58.61]He would have.
[162:00.34]My guy's just having fun.
[162:02.32]He is.
[162:02.62]Look at him.
[162:04.40]He doesn't even know why we're fighting.
[162:05.98]Well, let's take a look at the standings.
[162:11.91]Yeah, this is it, I think, Criken.
[162:14.05]Criken, did you just win?
[162:17.46]I mean, I could still lose against...
[162:25.75]I can still lose the next one and then it's if you lose the next one then okay alright uh we only got a couple more to do left who's up we got Squeaks and Vinny or Breiken and let me let me fight Gromfield okay I want I want to dodge these belly flops that sounds like you want to see Gromfield let's give me a fun fight to watch at least we'll do yeah Vinny versus Ster
[162:56.01]Grumfield, a very accurate and good name.
[162:58.85]Thank you.
[163:04.19]Grumfield.
[163:08.30]Alright, this one's going to be... I hope we get to see some real action.
[163:14.71]Real.
[163:17.23]Listen, I still really just want to see Grumfield do a belly flop to his death.
[163:21.61]That would make me so happy.
[163:23.10]This is definitely the opportunity for that to happen.
[163:26.45]It could.
[163:26.89]It could happen.
[163:29.67]Because he's got so much evade.
[163:31.36]Dam can evade all of his attacks.
[163:35.86]I want to see him kill himself.
[163:37.83]Sorry.
[163:38.73]Now the speed's too high on Gornfield for the same thing to happen.
[163:41.73]I think Gornfield's just going to stomp you.
[163:43.66]Gornfield does have high speed.
[163:45.60]I never even put that into fact.
[163:47.07]yeah this the skill is so this is look at gormfield's chance to hit against dam's speed so it's the skill that matters here for landing that move see he has a lot he does have a lot alright let's see instakill himself oh wait a second the confidence okay
[164:13.38]Dust cloud.
[164:15.38]Oh, a dust cloud connects.
[164:16.26]That's the only person getting hit by that.
[164:19.08]That's the first time that's ever done anything.
[164:22.23]Yeah, and it did one extra damage with 193 out of 192.
[164:26.71]That's weird.
[164:28.14]Why did that do so much damage?
[164:29.84]I don't know.
[164:30.76]Is it a power move or is it?
[164:32.22]Yeah, it is a power move, right?
[164:33.34]Yeah.
[164:34.36]Because it misses a lot too.
[164:36.43]I'm not going to be able to sleep tonight over this.
[164:38.05]Benny, do what I couldn't have done.
[164:41.21]Kill him.
[164:41.59]We'll try.
[164:42.65]We'll try.
[164:45.73]That speed is too high.
[164:46.63]There's such a long animation.
[164:52.18]Oh my god.
[164:53.66]Here it comes.
[164:54.92]Oh my god.
[164:57.62]Dammit.
[164:57.80]Why was that faster than usual?
[165:00.81]No, he landed it.
[165:02.57]Oh, dodge it.
[165:03.67]Dude.
[165:04.76]That's just like the rolling ball.
[165:06.18]You can dodge those.
[165:08.56]That diving press was like half the frame.
[165:10.14]It was like...
[165:12.32]Well, congratulations, Vinny.
[165:14.78]Animation canceled.
[165:15.71]It's still lost.
[165:18.55]Gormfield can take on anyone.
[165:21.47]I believe in Gormfield.
[165:23.77]You're now two and three, right?
[165:26.42]Let's see.
[165:26.94]Two, yes.
[165:30.24]Okay.
[165:31.56]Now we've got two more matches to do.
[165:36.27]So we can do... We've got to do Squeaks versus... Squeaks versus...
[165:43.76]You right here.
[165:44.70]Me, I think.
[165:45.46]Yeah.
[165:46.58]Oh, no, no.
[165:46.92]It's me versus.
[165:47.95]Yep.
[165:48.45]Squeaks versus me.
[165:50.03]Alright.
[165:50.39]That little fucker ruined my whole chances.
[165:53.41]Come on.
[165:53.59]I really think he like ruined the whole tournament.
[165:56.73]He fucked me, sir.
[165:59.44]And he's so cute.
[166:03.48]He's an industry plant.
[166:09.41]This is another must win scenario for me to place.
[166:12.89]I gotta get to three wins here.
[166:16.03]If I beat Criken, I could tie it out.
[166:18.82]True.
[166:20.54]Then we get a rematch then, right?
[166:21.84]Because we're both going to have one.
[166:23.80]Yeah, it would be a rematch.
[166:26.75]Alright.
[166:28.57]Bingo.
[166:29.29]Come on.
[166:30.83]Wait, we've fought before and you won, right?
[166:34.12]You're not my only... Wait, did we already go?
[166:36.52]Have you guys fought before?
[166:37.68]No, I'm sorry.
[166:38.42]I think I was thinking of someone else.
[166:40.41]uh I have no no we've not fought on these characters oh okay perfect oops cancel okay alright here we go alright I wonder who is this me too yeah it's gonna be over to the person me too I also wonder I don't even care I don't even wonder at all laser I don't yeah let's just end the stream it's all about if he gets a laser off instant if it's an instant laser he wins oh it's on I beam right there oh my god
[167:07.83]Dude, imagine waiting months and paying like $400 for a ticket to this and it's over in like less than a second.
[167:15.29]I guess you could say that sounds like Mike Tyson.
[167:17.29]Yeah, some boxing matches are like that, right?
[167:18.93]It's like millions and millions of dollars, huge hype, and it's just like it's over in 15 seconds.
[167:27.89]Alright, do the same thing back to back.
[167:30.39]Nope.
[167:31.20]Oh, he's aiming at it.
[167:32.44]I got the dog.
[167:33.08]Dodge it.
[167:35.44]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[167:55.35]frame both plates okay so now it's poke and Criken and this is going to if poke wins we go down to x ratings x ratings alright this is it and x rated
[168:18.34]X-Ratings?
[168:19.04]I want to see X-Rating Gormfield.
[168:25.95]Fuck it.
[168:26.65]Dive press me.
[168:27.63]I'm God versus Flaw D Bob.
[168:40.39]Close.
[168:44.04]Alright, must-win scenario for Poke.
[168:45.72]We could see a complete clean sweep.
[168:48.36]Come on, come on.
[168:49.32]This could be crazy.
[168:51.67]I believe.
[168:52.71]I got high skill, man.
[168:54.49]It's got to hit one.
[168:56.58]Maybe two.
[168:57.80]Your skill is so high.
[168:59.04]Your defense is so high, too.
[169:00.44]So even if he does hit you, you actually might eat it.
[169:03.89]He's a tank, dude.
[169:04.81]He's Skarner.
[169:05.61]I think he'd take two hits.
[169:08.67]Oh, I'll tell you which.
[169:09.34]Okay.
[169:14.29]Oh, okay.
[169:17.94]You're punching me in the stomach, like, really hard.
[169:20.94]He's real.
[169:22.16]Me when I'm real?
[169:25.07]He doesn't do anything when he's real.
[169:28.41]Oh, shit.
[169:30.82]That's big.
[169:31.88]He gets really hurt.
[169:33.56]That's crazy.
[169:35.83]Uh-oh.
[169:36.35]Are we going to run into extra ratings?
[169:41.97]It's like a Voices of the Void event.
[169:43.61]They're fucking real.
[169:48.52]Here we go.
[169:52.14]Get him.
[169:54.63]Oh, nice.
[169:57.03]Again.
[169:58.39]Oh, my God.
[169:59.41]Good.
[169:59.69]What was he doing?
[170:00.35]I was thinking one more punch.
[170:02.55]No, he's not good at that.
[170:04.73]Oh, this might be a real just hit the travel.
[170:08.24]He's like, oh, oh, oh, I don't.
[170:13.72]Oh, I dodged the next one here is pussy.
[170:18.19]I don't see 60 percent.
[170:19.93]Yeah, I don't.
[170:20.39]What is this, dude?
[170:21.15]I keep missing.
[170:21.63]And then I do it.
[170:23.99]Oh, oh, so sad.
[170:25.70]Alright.
[170:25.94]Last one.
[170:26.60]This is it.
[170:28.07]What happens?
[170:29.75]I'm so excited.
[170:33.66]Go for the instant trample.
[170:37.44]Do not go for the instant trample.
[170:38.68]Go for the death scythe.
[170:39.74]I'm God.
[170:40.97]I'm praying.
[170:42.31]I'm praying to you right now.
[170:50.34]Imagine praying over this.
[170:52.32]Oh, shit.
[170:54.62]Oh, it's a crit.
[170:59.10]I don't know how to message you.
[171:00.95]Please.

[172:10.54]Right here.
[172:11.19]All the marbles.
[172:15.47]Winner fights Gorm.
[172:19.34]Go.
[172:21.26]Trample.
[172:22.88]Don't trample.
[172:25.03]I saw it lined up.
[172:27.27]I saw it too.
[172:28.95]One more jump.
[172:29.81]Oh, gut punch.
[172:32.47]Oh, my God.
[172:33.01]That was 73%.
[172:34.67]Jesus.
[172:36.22]Oh, the hit.
[172:36.58]No, he's alive.
[172:38.18]What?
[172:38.98]Oh, power.
[172:40.34]Oh, shit.
[172:41.40]Power trample.
[172:42.06]Power trample.
[172:42.73]Do something.
[172:44.19]Oh, he's just looking.
[172:45.75]Oh, yes.
[172:46.09]He's just looking.
[172:46.99]He's RP walking.
[172:48.87]What was that?
[172:49.54]Yeah, he was just like.
[172:52.22]He was aura farming.
[172:55.22]Good fight.
[172:56.18]Congratulations on the bracket win.
[172:59.29]Thank you.
[173:00.99]That is a GG.
[173:01.85]He was a bastard to train, but damn, he's strong.
[173:06.41]It was worth it.
[173:07.21]Clearly.
[173:07.64]That was a great ending, though.
[173:08.94]That was a great finish.
[173:12.30]Alright, so... Are you doing bracket winner versus bracket winner?
[173:15.06]That is the deal.
[173:16.96]So, Ster and Kryken, both of you, right now, get to decide.
[173:24.99]Do you both... Ster, you only have two monsters?
[173:29.76]I only got two.
[173:30.87]Okay.
[173:31.87]So, you both have to pick a monster.
[173:35.39]It could be any of the ones that you have.
[173:37.25]Are we not doing a third bracket?
[173:41.76]I don't... Just for you two to win, I'd just like to... So, if we do another bracket, I want to leave this up to you guys.
[173:50.15]So, if we do a third bracket, half of us don't have a third monster.
[173:55.36]You'd have to use something that you already used.
[173:57.92]If you guys don't care about that, then we can do it.
[174:00.91]Do you guys not care about having repeat monsters?
[174:04.44]I was saving my best for last, so I kind of want to do another one, but I... Or we could also do it again another time, because I feel like this is a lot of fun.
[174:14.33]I don't know, do you guys think this is cool?
[174:16.16]If the other... It was fun.
[174:18.32]Can I interject?
[174:19.02]I would love to come back another time for the third bracket, now knowing how the fuck the game works.
[174:24.41]Okay.
[174:25.70]let's do this then let's we let's put this on ice not right obviously we're going to see Ster versus Criken but uh we won't do the third bracket the people that don't have three monsters can uh make a third monster and we can just do another bracket at some other time and just just one bracket for fun so good let's see soon too
[174:51.39]Yeah, I don't know.
[174:53.59]If you guys liked it, I mean, this was a lot of fun.
[174:55.77]I absolutely loved it.
[174:57.24]I fucking loved this.
[174:58.18]It was so fun.
[174:59.84]Cool.
[174:59.96]Alright, so... I like training the monsters.
[175:02.00]The game is really good.
[175:03.38]I just remember playing it as a kid.
[175:04.79]Dude, people slept on this game.
[175:06.55]It's like one of the best PlayStation 1 games ever.
[175:10.33]Alright, so let's find out the true winner.
[175:12.94]Do you guys want to do this like a best of five?
[175:16.88]Sure.
[175:17.80]And I'm imagining you guys are going to pick your...
[175:21.85]I think it should be the ones that won.
[175:24.59]The ones that won, yeah.
[175:25.97]Okay, so best of five of the ones that won, that would be Claw D. Buster and Yermit 2.0.
[175:38.47]That pisses me off more than anything that in my Monster Rancher 2 tournament, you stole my identity and you won with it.
[175:49.02]I didn't steal it.
[175:49.74]I improved it.
[175:53.88]Oh, drama.
[175:56.31]So iterated on the monster for my third bracket that I was saving.
[176:01.53]Ironically, that didn't wake up for this final fight.
[176:05.16]His name is can't wake up because he's based on Evanescence.
[176:08.70]And I'm just hoping we do a third bracket, man, because he is a he's a sweetheart.
[176:15.09]I really want to see a fight.
[176:16.25]Sweetheart.
[176:17.37]That's so sad.
[176:19.63]I mean, if we're going to do a third bracket, we should have like a fourth one that's like a specific rule.
[176:24.82]Yeah, a random rule or something.
[176:26.46]I like doing two brackets per stream, right?
[176:28.54]So I think just picking it again and making them two more.
[176:32.07]Yeah, if you guys want to make another monster, whoever has two, make two more.
[176:36.81]And whoever has three, just make one more.
[176:39.24]Ooh, fourth one, no drugs.
[176:41.00]Yeah, drug free.
[176:42.16]Yeah, absolute drug free on the fourth bracket.
[176:45.97]Okay.
[176:47.27]Yeah, just mint leaf and nut oil.
[176:50.28]Those two.
[176:51.76]I can do that.
[176:52.92]Or do whatever you guys want, but just no drugs, right?
[176:55.83]Yeah, because look, we see what happens when drugs are allowed.
[176:59.41]Look at these two roided out motherfuckers right here.
[177:02.88]I love the power bar clipping into the number.
[177:05.38]It's so good.
[177:07.40]You can't even read it.
[177:09.99]Alright, here we go.
[177:10.55]This is for everything.
[177:13.51]I just want to say, if he wins, at least I can bench more than him.
[177:17.73]975.
[177:18.13]I mean, I don't think that's the true measure of strength, but whatever you say, you're meant.
[177:24.66]2.0, sorry.
[177:26.08]Here we go.
[177:28.31]Puzzle!
[177:30.07]Oh, the early dodge.
[177:31.39]That's huge.
[177:32.89]Gut punch.
[177:33.43]No, don't push him away.
[177:36.17]Bro!
[177:38.20]The defense...
[177:39.87]I have 99% hit.
[177:40.73]Oh, my God.
[177:42.51]What a hit.
[177:43.41]How did you have 99% chance?
[177:45.20]You have 90% chance to hit.
[177:47.44]I have like 20 speed.
[177:50.15]Oh, that's bad.
[177:50.93]Oh, wow.
[177:52.77]Okay.
[177:53.68]Alright.
[177:53.90]That's one.
[177:55.08]Come on, Claude.
[178:00.40]Come on.
[178:01.73]It's just, like, kind of not fair.
[178:03.47]You got, like, a cool blue lobster, and I got a dumb cat.
[178:07.19]You got a dumb cat that tries to kill itself.
[178:10.78]That was my favorite.
[178:12.16]I still love him.
[178:14.40]No, this is not looking good.
[178:16.40]Oh, no.
[178:17.60]Wow.
[178:17.86]The double gut punch.
[178:20.99]Is this the last one?
[178:21.81]Is this for all the marbles?
[178:23.13]Yeah, if you win.
[178:24.13]If you win this next one, that's it.
[178:30.00]Alright, come on, Yermit.
[178:31.95]Alright, Yermit, you got to make it interesting.
[178:33.11]Come on, jump on him.
[178:35.63]Yeah, jump on me.
[178:39.68]How about this?
[178:42.26]Oh, he got confused.
[178:44.40]No, not the gut punch.
[178:45.26]Do something interesting.
[178:46.18]Alright, alright, alright.
[178:47.18]Oh, here we go.
[178:49.47]Oh, that was a one hit.
[178:51.17]That's nuts.
[178:51.93]Okay.
[178:53.07]Shit.
[178:53.95]Okay.
[178:54.39]Dude, this would be just like when the Red Sox came back from the Yankees in 2004.
[178:59.40]It would be so like that, man.
[179:04.00]Uh, yeah, no, I was a Yankee fan, huh?
[179:07.21]Best baseball team ever.
[179:09.75]That's right, go Yankees.
[179:11.86]Oh, do you guys, what, New York?
[179:14.10]That's right.
[179:17.46]Well, there you go.
[179:18.02]That was climactic.
[179:23.85]The announcers, like the sports commentators, are just having a side conversation.
[179:29.98]What about that other sport that we're not casting right now?
[179:34.40]Oh, it looks like we're over.
[179:35.42]We have a grand final.
[179:36.84]Okay.
[179:36.96]Alright.
[179:37.76]What if, though?
[179:38.35]What if?
[179:39.63]Okay, what if?
[179:41.05]I think he's just too well-rounded.
[179:42.69]He's the better monster.
[179:43.73]I have to hand it to him.
[179:44.71]You raised this guy well.
[179:46.12]The death scythe is a one-shot, even though you don't... Oh, oh.
[179:50.14]I'm all bite.
[179:51.36]I'm just all bite.
[179:52.14]If I don't bite it, then I don't got nothing.
[179:55.19]Dude, the 90% hit chance is actually crazy.
[180:00.26]Claude Debussy is fucking incredible.
[180:03.16]A tank.
[180:04.89]He wasn't even the best.
[180:05.71]They're saying a fan match of Brokeboy versus Dam or Gorefield.
[180:11.54]Brokeboy versus Dam.
[180:14.27]I think Brokeboy versus Dam, the mascot match.
[180:18.07]The mascot match is so mean.
[180:22.86]Yeah, we're going to do Brokeboy versus Dam in a mascot fight.
[180:30.69]But actually, he won games.
[180:33.11]He did well.
[180:34.56]alright let's do that and then we can be done with it alright fan fan match broke boy versus damn the people's champion wait broke boy hasn't won a single match right no oh man alright here we go
[181:05.59]Let's see it.
[181:07.39]Oh, they're so cute.
[181:10.10]They're both so cute.
[181:12.20]I have to get my... If Brokeboy wins, that would be insane.
[181:16.45]Brokeboy's first win.
[181:17.73]You guys want to put stakes on this?
[181:21.54]Stakes?
[181:22.22]PS5, you're giving... I'll give you the PS5 Jeremy gave me.
[181:28.20]Okay, so, Ster, after you play Demon's Souls, which is happening next week, which is great.
[181:33.57]By the way, guys, next week, Ster on twitch.tv/Ster is going to be playing Demon's Souls Remake.
[181:40.68]So that's where I'm going to be live.
[181:43.99]I'll be live with Ster.
[181:46.77]Yeah, I'm going to be live, but not live, just watching Ster play Demon's Souls Remake.
[181:51.91]So that's what my plan is next week.
[181:54.37]So thank you, Ster.
[181:55.28]Sir, if you lose this after Demon's Souls, you have to send the PS5 to Poke.
[181:59.82]I already have one.
[182:00.88]Yeah, but after you beat Demon's Souls.
[182:02.80]If he beats it.
[182:06.25]Yeah, and then Poke has to play Demon's Souls.
[182:08.43]I don't think he's going to beat it.
[182:09.39]I mean, based on his abiotic factor experience.
[182:14.52]Oh yeah, I'm bringing it up.
[182:17.06]Man.
[182:18.64]So happy I didn't join in for that.
[182:19.70]You know what?
[182:20.28]Let me punch this thing to death.
[182:22.76]Yeah, let's fight it out in the arena.
[182:24.72]Let's see.
[182:26.41]Settle it in the ring.
[182:26.91]Put it all out in the field.
[182:30.45]I feel like not having other moves is just the worst thing ever.
[182:35.80]Because it just hovers over nothing.
[182:37.76]You're going to die of paper scratches here.
[182:40.22]Yeah, he's not going to be able to hit anything.
[182:43.46]Oh, no.
[182:43.62]Look at this.
[182:44.04]Brokeboy, please.
[182:45.39]Come on, Brokeboy.
[182:47.60]No.
[182:48.60]We need this.
[182:49.84]You're not going to touch him.
[182:51.50]Come on.
[182:52.24]One hit.
[182:52.99]Alright.
[182:55.45]If you hit him one time, then, Ster, you have to send the PS5 to Poke.
[183:01.75]This is brutal.
[183:04.02]Come on.
[183:04.48]Just eat him.
[183:08.92]Okay.
[183:10.56]Wait a second.
[183:11.26]Use that dope-ass move.
[183:13.14]There goes the PS5.
[183:14.51]It's gone.
[183:15.43]ah well now you don't have anything to watch next wait a second psf pro now oh my god oh my god wait two ps5s too late though I think it's multiplying no you gotta hit it oh hey this is like a Monster Rancher fight from like the early 80s before everyone started juicing
[183:47.20]oh come on propo you need a win oh wait a second come on broke boy the punch is so funny oh he just keeps comboing you what a dodge oh 85 dodge
[184:19.20]Oh, what the hell?
[184:22.84]I want to see that hit one time.
[184:24.90]Did it hit last time?
[184:26.69]No.
[184:28.73]It's a 12% chance.
[184:30.41]He has other moves, but they're all on the same slot.
[184:34.63]I don't think he's smart enough to scroll down two times to do his other moves besides fight.
[184:39.86]I get the attacks now.
[184:42.82]Heavy attacks.
[184:44.16]It's in one spot.
[184:45.76]Oh my god.
[184:46.69]Brokeboy, you won in our hearts, but not out on the battlefield.
[184:52.54]Damn.
[184:56.10]That's so sad.
[184:56.92]You didn't win a single match.
[184:58.71]Well, I had so much fun.
[184:59.81]I'm telling you, Jerma, I almost messaged you last night saying, I don't know if I can do this.
[185:04.90]I was like, I just didn't understand the game at all.
[185:08.62]And then I just locked in and did it.
[185:10.72]So fun.
[185:11.34]Yeah, you locked in.
[185:12.15]You had the power.
[185:13.84]I do understand that I give homework to people, and this was like five hours of homework at least.
[185:23.01]Yeah, it was tough.
[185:24.53]But I do think it was a lot of fun.
[185:28.70]I think hopefully you guys had fun.
[185:30.20]I knew it was going to be an interesting event, an interesting little tournament.
[185:33.66]Who knows?
[185:35.24]Maybe next time you'll see an evolved Brokeboy.
[185:38.17]Dude, that would be pretty cool.
[185:41.78]So the redemption I was told poke that apparently broke boy that worm is the only monster in the game that actually
[185:49.85]it really that actually what it did it pop up what evolves right that evolves and it does oh yeah it apparently evolves and not only that it evolves into the can't wake up monster that I made like are you serious yeah a broken man do you want to do a match broke boy verse can't wake up to see what he could become his full potential it's just are you gonna use him the third week though yeah or I could save him for the third week if we're gonna do this again
[186:18.47]Did he use drugs?
[186:20.27]He did use drugs.
[186:21.36]He used a lot.
[186:22.26]He used a lot.
[186:23.90]He is one day from death.
[186:25.74]He is literally... Okay, no spoil, no spoil.
[186:29.11]Can we do it now or save it as like a story, you know?
[186:31.35]Yeah, save it.
[186:32.25]Save it for the story.
[186:33.49]I can't wait to see what he looks like.
[186:35.62]Plus, I gotta take my dog out.
[186:36.68]It's not what you imagined.
[186:38.80]Go do your thing.
[186:40.57]I gotta take Mr. Otto out.
[186:42.49]Wait, does that mean you're done?
[186:46.35]Yeah, that's all we got for now.
[186:50.45]I was thinking, what if we played Mage Arena 3v3?
[186:56.32]What is Mage Arena?
[186:58.24]It looks like the perfect game for us.
[187:01.26]It just looks like the best game for us.
[187:04.13]Can we do all?
[187:05.35]I mean, anybody got other stuff going on?
[187:07.33]How are you guys doing?
[187:10.43]I'm down.
[187:11.63]I'm down.
[187:13.38]What if we did it for 10 minutes?
[187:20.12]Sure, I'm looking at it now.
[187:21.14]It looks kind of dopey.
[187:22.58]Sure.
[187:23.18]Let's take five, because I've got to take care of Otto.
[187:27.19]And we'll switch to that and play it for 10 minutes.
[187:28.94]Who cares?
[187:29.38]Let's play it for 10 minutes.
[187:30.86]Do it.
[187:31.38]I love you guys.
[187:32.05]Yes.
