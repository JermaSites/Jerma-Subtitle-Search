[ve:60.16.100]

[01:03.80]Hello, how are you?
[01:10.70]How is everybody doing today?
[01:15.35]Today I think I'm going to be playing some Nancy Drew.
[01:21.51]And also Diablo 4.
[01:28.81]How you doing, good?
[01:36.43]Starting off strong on this one.
[01:37.90]Starting off strong.
[01:39.26]No, I'm going to slow it down a little bit today.
[01:46.06]There was a TikTok voiceover.
[01:51.26]No, go full speed.
[01:54.44]How many stream points do I have?
[01:58.70]Stream points?
[02:00.60]Like channel points on my own channel?
[02:02.95]Do I even get them?
[02:07.14]Introducing channel points.
[02:08.22]Watch Jerma985 earn channel points.
[02:10.18]Unlock rewards.
[02:10.94]I haven't even clicked the button to begin accruing points.
[02:14.76]So I guess the answer is zero.
[02:24.80]Isn't... Wouldn't I be... I don't know, yeah.
[02:30.40]Me making my... Getting my own currency created for my own channel from me?
[02:36.92]I feel like that's contributing to... I don't... No, I don't want to do that.
[02:40.05]I would want to make sure... I would want to take away from myself from having that many points.
[02:43.05]Fake fan.
[02:52.59]Some kind of currency thing.
[02:55.99]Dude just click it.
[02:57.73]I don't want to click get it get started I don't want when I click you click get started that just to me tells the computer like alright I'm I'm ready to do this now, and I don't even want to do it.
[03:10.44]You're I mean I don't want to click get started because I want to finish it the second that I click get started Like the title I mean it's true
[03:25.98]Scared of commitment.
[03:27.71]I'm scared of committing to things that I don't necessarily really care that much about.
[03:31.43]I said Steam points.
[03:37.35]God damn it.
[03:38.23]Why does this happen to me every day?
[03:48.40]Your balance on Steam.
[03:51.14]I don't know.
[03:51.92]I don't even...
[03:59.65]I don't know.
[04:02.11]I have... 200.
[04:02.81]There you go.
[04:03.45]This is my balance.
[04:06.29]200.
[04:06.35]A lot.
[04:10.99]200 points.
[04:11.37]That's a shitload.
[04:24.75]No, not your Steam wallet balance.
[04:27.47]That's not accurate.
[04:28.33]I've just made up a number.
[04:35.97]I feel like that would be kind of a lot of money to have in a Steam wallet, wouldn't it?
[04:39.33]Like $200 plus?
[04:41.09]Maybe not, depending on how many games you plan on buying.
[04:53.52]But anyways, let's talk about what's happening.
[04:55.80]Okay?
[04:58.37]Let's talk.
[05:00.87]Today, we're going to be finishing our Nancy Drew homework.
[05:06.28]I feel like the Diablo 4 servers... I played it... I have to confess.
[05:10.74]I played it a lot last night.
[05:14.71]Holly and I played it a lot.
[05:18.25]I made another character, and I just kind of... Kind of went... We kind of went nuts.
[05:26.63]Without us.
[05:27.45]Yeah.
[05:28.67]I did...
[05:35.09]But I can tell you that I enjoy it.
[05:40.38]I think it is fun to play.
[05:43.78]And I'm hoping that the game is searching to how to stay fair.
[05:52.04]It's searching.
[05:53.40]It's trying to come up with a way to say be fair about it, but also not too involved.
[05:58.09]Don't let them think that you care that much.
[06:00.27]That's what's screaming through my brain right now.
[06:02.37]So what I want to tell you is I want to play as the Necromancer.
[06:09.50]That'll be the way that I really tell if I'm going to play it or not.
[06:17.83]But I do like... I like it so far.
[06:24.70]I don't know how deep the skill system is really going to go.
[06:27.38]I don't know how deep the itemization is going to be.
[06:30.30]But if Necromancer is fun, I will probably be playing it.
[06:36.51]That's it.
[06:37.89]That's it.
[06:44.06]But today is the last day that it can be played for this week.
[06:47.98]So the plan is to do Nancy Drew for a little while.
[06:50.76]Maybe get to the end of that.
[06:51.74]Maybe get how far enough into there that I want to, you know, play it.
[06:57.83]And then move on to D4 for the rest of the night.
[07:00.73]Just chill because I think it's turning off at midnight.
[07:05.35]Is it tomorrow at midnight or is it tonight at midnight?
[07:07.49]Because I still want to play with the sorcerers.
[07:15.64]3 p.m.
[07:16.24]on Monday Eastern, okay.
[07:17.98]So there's plenty of time.
[07:20.70]And then... Resident Evil 4, I'm gonna play it essentially until I beat it.
[07:28.61]So that's, I believe, the... Is that the 23rd at midnight, or is that the 24th in the middle of the day?
[07:33.91]I asked this in pre-stream.
[07:36.13]I'm curious if anybody knows.
[07:37.19]Is the Resident Evil 4 remake coming out, like, in the middle of the day on the 24th, or is it gonna be, like, a midnight release on Thursday?
[07:43.48]Okay.
[07:44.93]I don't think anybody really knows.
[07:54.32]He didn't even listen to our answer.
[07:59.42]It's just out when it's out.
[08:01.70]Yeah.
[08:02.98]Well, whatever.
[08:03.84]Whenever it launches on the 24th, that is when I will be getting ready to play it.
[08:09.70]Apparently, the remake, as of all the reviews I've seen, is stellar.
[08:14.26]It is getting unbelievable reviews.
[08:17.41]Some of these outlets are giving it a 10.
[08:18.81]This is getting 10s.
[08:22.17]So... I don't want to say that, like, okay... Am I... I don't want to say it, but I'm going to say it.
[08:30.25]I gave the Resident Evil 2 remake Game of the Year when it came out.
[08:34.23]Is that going to happen again for another Resident Evil remake?
[08:37.76]It might.
[08:39.08]We'll see.
[08:42.06]That's funny, though.
[08:44.58]Oh, BatChest, stellar reviews.
[08:46.32]Alright.
[08:58.87]I am going to open up Nancy Drew.
[09:00.01]I might not put the camera on.
[09:02.83]I've been doing no cam and I've been liking it.
[09:06.95]We'll see.
[09:07.41]Maybe we'll turn it on a little bit later.
[09:10.49]We'll go camless for now.
[09:17.52]Don't worry about the cam.
[09:18.48]Yeah, no, I know.
[09:20.18]I know.
[09:20.44]Nobody here is pressuring me to put it on.
[09:22.20]Don't worry.
[09:23.18]Just last night was kind of like I was feeling it.
[09:25.06]Let's put it on and just fuck around.
[09:26.60]It's going to happen a lot.
[09:27.86]Alright.
[09:29.72]Nancy Drew.
[09:31.56]Does anyone remember anything that we did?
[09:33.88]I'll be really honest with you.
[09:35.42]Not last night.
[09:36.43]My sense of time is so fucked up.
[09:40.72]We were going back and forth between Nancy Drew and Diablo that I kind of don't even remember what the hell we even did.
[09:44.79]Hey, I tried to do the cat puke noise and it just makes me sound like I'm burping.
[09:50.51]Do you have any tips?
[09:52.56]I do not recommend anybody attempt that.
[09:54.06]Don't try that at home.
[09:56.94]Uh you should not- don't try this at home, okay?
[09:59.94]I need to make I need to put like a huge disclaimer up somewhere on the stream that just- just don't ever try anything or say anything I say ever, don't ever do any of this and don't watch and don't uh- comment, don't subscribe, don't be here.
[01:10.00]I should probably put that up, right?
[01:12.00]Don't ever say anything that I say, don't ever do anything that I've done, don't ever attempt anything I've done, don't ever watchm don't subscribe, don't donate or anything.
[01:19.00]Um- you know what I mean just- probably like a disclaimer.
[10:24.00]That would be such a fucked up disclaimer.
[10:27.00]Don't watch.
[10:29.00]Just put it at the bottom of the screen. Hold on.
[10:36.00]I gotta think of like a huge paragraph though - I should have thought about this like an hour ago.
[10:41.00]No, I'll do it another day.
[10:45.00]Alright, Nancy Drew. What do you got? Hopefully it's not too loud.
[10:54.95]How's the audio?
[10:55.79]Is it alright?
[10:58.33]Do not attempt anything.
[10:59.37]You see a... Yeah, but people that are coming in and seeing that pinned are going to think I'm about to, like, backflip off of a building or something, right?
[11:06.81]Like, you get that warning before something crazy is about to happen.
[11:10.96]And they're going to be really disappointed when it's just Nancy Drew.
[11:13.64]I'm not going to do anything.
[11:16.66]That's a warning to me.
[11:18.24]To me, that is something dangerous is going to happen at some point.
[11:21.94]He's going to turn his cam on.
[11:23.02]He's going to get, like, attacked by a bear or something.
[11:28.76]alright anyways what I need to focus we we fished we put the line in we did the fishing minigame I couldn't keep one right I snagged a log there goes my line
[11:47.08]Can you stop being funny for a minute?
[11:48.44]I need to pee.
[11:51.04]Well, I think funny is very subjective to people.
[11:54.08]So you might have thought that was really funny, what just happened, but somebody else might not think that what I just did was funny.
[11:59.88]And you two need to come to some common ground of what you think is funny for me, because it's very subjective.
[12:05.25]So I think you could have made a lot of people very upset with what you just said.
[12:14.89]I need a container for the fish.
[12:19.09]It's a comedy committee.
[12:24.29]Alright, so I got it.
[12:25.59]What the hell have we been doing?
[12:29.66]Alright, what the hell happened?
[12:31.80]The wolf, right?
[12:32.66]I remember the wolf.
[12:36.06]I remember this guy, the avalanche.
[12:37.18]We reported the avalanche.
[12:38.34]I remember that.
[12:41.28]We cooked dinner.
[12:42.72]We cooked lunch for people.
[12:47.52]I have access to the snowmobile.
[12:49.97]So, I gotta track down the snowmobile.
[12:53.61]This is Nancy Drew, guys.
[12:59.67]Beyond Centrist Andy.
[13:02.53]How do you go- Wait, wait.
[13:03.81]Beyond Centrist Andy?
[13:06.31]Wait a minute.
[13:06.75]That's not correct.
[13:08.99]Wouldn't Beyond Centrist Andy be, like, not in the middle?
[13:14.27]That would be beyond the middle.
[13:17.57]So I can't be, I can't go too far centrist because that means I have to go somewhere.
[13:24.98]Oh shit, she's gonna die.
[13:28.07]She's gonna die.
[13:28.73]Why is she, what's happening?
[13:31.41]Turn around, turn around, turn around.
[13:32.29]Where am I going?
[13:33.23]Turn around, turn around.
[13:34.13]Nancy, turn around.
[13:36.57]Icicle lake.
[13:37.11]No, this way.
[13:43.07]I'm walking wicked stiff too.
[13:44.67]Alright, there's the snowmobile.
[13:47.77]Let me go inside and warm up for a second.
[13:53.98]This is an unhinged stream incoming.
[13:55.96]No, it's not.
[14:00.04]No, it's on the Z-axis.
[14:01.10]You're still a centrist.
[14:05.32]Z-axis.
[14:06.40]What?
[14:07.60]I want to go...
[14:16.40]What?
[14:16.60]It's 7 a.m.
[14:17.02]Hold on a minute.
[14:17.94]Am I being put into timeout?
[14:19.30]Is this timeout?
[14:20.04]Get in there and stay there for a while.
[14:22.46]What?
[14:47.17]Wait, what are we eating?
[14:49.21]French toast?
[14:50.01]It didn't tell me how to make French toast.
[14:51.53]I thought I only know how to make hamburgers.
[14:54.23]How do you make French toast?
[14:55.11]I didn't get a tutorial.
[14:59.05]Oh, hold on.
[15:00.85]Yes, may I order French toast?
[15:03.45]You hear the cook.
[15:04.27]Are you just waiting for breakfast?
[15:06.39]What is French toast?
[15:07.19]I don't know how to make this.
[15:08.35]What is this?
[15:09.01]Where's this?
[15:09.37]Where's the step-by-step instruction?
[15:12.81]I would just drink an orange juice and walk out.
[15:16.43]I would take the yogurt sitting in the ice.
[15:19.62]Which always freaks me out.
[15:20.98]But, eh.
[15:23.56]Eh, you know, whatever.
[15:25.30]Like, I know that when the yogurt's sitting in the ice, I kind of feel like I want that in a, I don't know, I want it in a fridge.
[15:30.04]Because it's like yogurt.
[15:30.88]I don't want it left out.
[15:33.30]Because what if like the top part's getting cold?
[15:34.98]I mean, the bottom part's getting freezing cold.
[15:36.80]The top part might be at like room temp.
[15:38.02]I don't know.
[15:39.72]Anyway, somebody's asking, do you know how to make French toast without the book?
[15:43.74]Let me see if I got it right.
[15:47.78]Okay.
[15:48.92]It's two pieces of bread.
[15:51.16]And you dunk the bread in egg and an egg wash.
[15:57.06]And then after you soak the bread in an egg wash, you put it on like a pan and you kind of cook it.
[16:06.33]And then you put, I don't know, like cinnamon and sugar on it.
[16:08.65]I don't eat French toast.
[16:10.25]I don't really like French toast.
[16:11.45]Why would I know how to make this?
[16:12.43]Why would I care about making the food that I don't eat?
[16:18.57]I don't eat French toast, so why do I care?
[16:22.67]I'm not a sugary breakfast guy.
[16:24.93]I'm a savory breakfast guy.
[16:27.48]Eggs.
[16:28.46]Corned beef hash.
[16:29.38]Bacon.
[16:30.28]Sausage.
[16:30.74]Toast.
[16:32.70]Orange juice.
[16:33.44]A shitload.
[16:33.98]A huge, like a 32 ounce glass of orange juice.
[16:36.50]I'm talking like a fucking thermos that you would take if you were going hiking for like three days.
[16:40.99]That amount of orange juice.
[16:44.07]Alright, what do they want?
[16:49.77]Okay.
[16:50.19]French toast and Canadian bacon should be cooked on the griddle.
[16:53.03]Omelet should be in the frying pan.
[16:54.87]Make sure all food is thoroughly cooked before removing it from the griddle or pan.
[16:57.45]French toast and omelet should be golden brown.
[16:59.95]While Canadian bacon should be lightly browned.
[17:02.69]When making an omelet, simply add any extra ingredients to the pan of egg mixture.
[17:10.99]Fold the omelet over.
[17:12.07]Whatever.
[17:12.35]They're going to get what they get.
[17:18.82]How many pieces of French toast?
[17:20.06]It's two, right?
[17:24.66]Is it done?
[17:25.09]How do I pick this up?
[17:31.85]I'm fanning through the book with a piece of my hand.
[17:36.33]Oh, that's not it.
[17:37.73]How do I put this down?
[17:38.96]Oh, now look what you've done.
[17:41.76]Chantal's not gonna like this.
[17:47.53]Okay, honestly, how do I put it down?
[17:49.75]One French toast.
[17:52.67]I put this ingredient down.
[17:54.03]Okay, this French toast.
[18:01.08]Beautiful.
[18:01.70]Three Canadian bacon.
[18:09.47]Okay.
[18:09.71]Do I flip it?
[18:16.02]Why is this not cooking?
[18:22.80]Is the oven on?
[18:23.68]Oh.
[18:29.66]Okay, one omelet.
[18:31.02]And then you want spinach, two bacon.
[18:33.32]One bacon, two spinach, and two green peppers.
[18:35.12]Alright, omelet.
[18:36.62]Where's the egg?
[18:40.02]Okay.
[18:40.18]Okay.
[18:44.05]And then what?
[18:45.39]What do you want?
[18:45.95]Fuck, this is wrong.
[18:53.18]Three... Okay, one bacon, two spinach, two green peppers.
[18:56.58]What, is this bacon?
[18:59.50]One bacon, two... What is this spinach?
[19:06.13]One bacon, two spinach... Two green peppers.
[19:10.37]Okay.
[19:12.49]Okay.
[19:24.18]Hey, come on, we're hungry here.
[19:26.56]I'm going, I'm working.
[19:30.00]Okay.
[19:31.49]Order up.
[19:32.15]Order up.
[19:34.21]Three French toast, two Canadian bacon, that's all you want.
[19:46.75]Imagine waiting hours for French toast.
[19:49.73]Imagine forcing somebody that doesn't know anything about how to cook meals for more than one or two people at a time and not being a chef.
[19:57.37]I'm a fucking detective at a detective agency telling that person that they need to be the chef for an expensive lodge.
[20:05.09]I can tell you one thing that that would be pretty dumb.
[20:09.43]Are we sure that I am I am I wrong here?
[20:13.76]Okay, two French toasts, one omelet.
[20:16.12]Let's get the French toast on there.
[20:17.18]And what do you want in it?
[20:20.24]Spinach, cheese, three green, three olives.
[20:23.58]Spinach, cheese, three green, three olives.
[20:25.64]Spinach, green, three olives.
[20:28.78]I don't remember.
[20:30.04]One spinach, one cheese, three green peppers.
[20:36.28]Ah!
[20:37.04]What?
[20:37.94]Oh my god, I'm fucking so mad right now.
[20:43.76]Bring me here.
[20:44.50]I don't want to do this.
[20:46.20]I don't want to do this.
[20:48.06]What if... You know what?
[20:48.82]Who cares?
[20:50.86]Does it matter?
[20:52.16]I don't... Who cares?

[21:40.80]I don't want to be in the kitchen.
[21:42.18]I don't want to be in the kitchen.
[21:42.92]I don't want to fucking be here.
[21:43.66]I would never do this.
[21:44.40]I would never do it.
[21:45.96]Nancy, you need to cook for like ten people.
[21:47.86]Good.

[22:28.87]And then it's two.
[22:35.79]Single task Andy.
[22:37.28]I don't want to mess it up.
[22:38.44]This game, guys, this game came out when some of you guys weren't even born yet.

[22:57.12]Three.
[22:57.46]Okay, so this is three here.
[23:11.66]Why does this take so much longer than anything else?
[23:13.50]I feel like this would be the fastest thing to go.
[23:15.36]Okay.
[23:21.83]Then, two Canadian bacon.
[23:24.55]Five.
[23:26.17]Six.
[23:26.55]Seven.
[23:33.41]This is two.
[23:35.02]Three.
[23:40.01]How many people here weren't born in 2007?
[23:42.56]Is that when this game came out?
[23:45.74]I apparently have a lot of 10-year-olds here.
[23:49.98]I didn't think about that.
[23:51.14]How many doesn't want three?
[23:52.52]Stop making me laugh, you're fucking me up.
[23:57.16]This whole channel is 10-year-olds.
[24:01.55]Alright, two more?
[24:15.65]Dude, 2007 was 28 years ago.
[24:18.65]Aware.
[24:26.91]Alright.
[24:27.87]Now we do the complicated shit with the omelettes.
[24:31.98]One omelet.
[24:32.94]This person wants a fully loaded omelet.
[24:37.30]One bacon.
[24:38.76]Three spinach.
[24:39.60]Three cheese.
[24:40.66]I would put the cheese first.
[24:42.08]In my opinion, the greens and vegetables is after.
[24:44.86]This is throwing me off.
[24:46.66]One bacon.
[24:47.10]Three cheese.
[24:52.44]One bacon.
[24:54.42]One, two, three.
[24:57.94]Three spinach.
[24:58.54]Three peppers.
[24:59.42]One olive.
[25:06.54]Here you go.
[25:06.84]What the hell do you want?
[25:09.17]One bacon, one spinach?
[25:13.69]What the hell else do you want?
[25:15.97]Two green, one olive.
[25:17.39]Alright, that's all you wanted, right?
[25:27.84]Omelettes kind of suck.
[25:33.06]Yeah, actually I'm not a big fan of omelettes either.
[25:36.02]To me, omelets almost feel like they're too much.
[25:39.59]Order up.
[25:40.15]I don't know why.
[25:41.31]It sounds like I've eaten a whole omelet.
[25:42.89]Just kind of like, bleh.
[25:44.67]I can't really do it.
[25:46.47]Alright, two bacon, two spinach, one green.
[25:51.09]Two bacon.
[25:52.70]Two spinach.
[25:54.12]One green.
[25:54.84]What else do you want?
[25:56.72]Two olives.
[25:58.70]What do you want in here?
[26:00.50]No omelet, okay.
[26:01.98]So you're done.
[26:06.45]Order up.
[26:07.75]So you want three spinach, one cheese, two green, three spinach, two, wait, two green, one cheese, two olive.
[26:23.56]Wait, which one is this one?
[26:26.70]I forget.
[26:29.42]Which one is the, who got, who got this one?
[26:31.10]Who got this one?
[26:33.59]This is this person's, right?
[26:37.17]Order up.
[26:38.01]Okay, good.
[26:40.53]And then no omelet for you?
[26:41.53]Order up.
[26:42.63]We got it.
[26:55.11]We did it.
[26:56.07]Finally.
[26:56.41]Jeez.
[27:01.18]Okay, so.
[27:01.82]I think we're alright.
[27:03.58]I think we did a pretty good job.
[27:09.21]We're good.
[27:10.81]So now, what were we doing?
[27:12.45]Oh, the snowmobile.
[27:13.03]Let's get the hell out of here.
[27:32.57]Move.
[27:32.71]How am I driving this on this?
[27:34.53]Doesn't it have to be in snow?
[27:43.79]What is going on?
[27:46.19]Um... No, Nancy's dead.
[27:53.95]Wait, how?
[27:57.73]You crashed it on your mobile?
[28:06.43]Not only crashed it, I pretty much trashed it.
[28:08.69]I didn't mean to, but I guess I zigged when I should have zagged.
[28:15.27]Do we- do we do it again?
[28:16.05]Have I fired?
[28:16.53]Oh no.
[28:16.71]Okay, well now we know what happens when you just hold the pedal down to the floor.
[28:41.72]Honestly, to crash that many times as violently as I- Jesus Christ!
[28:46.35]To crash that violently, I feel like the car needs to be made out of magnets or something, and it just pulled me around.
[28:51.01]Oh my god.
[29:02.67]Um, what is the hitbox?
[29:16.17]Is somebody in there?
[29:16.67]Oh, okay.
[29:18.73]I think I made it.
[29:19.21]Okay.
[29:23.95]How do I put the key down?
[29:25.03]No, I want to put the key away.
[29:25.89]Why can't I...
[29:51.01]Spell avalanche right now.
[29:52.15]Okay, I'm not looking at chat.
[29:53.81]Avalanche.
[29:55.09]A-V-A-L-A-N-C-H-E.
[29:58.38]Avalanche.
[29:59.28]Correct?
[30:01.36]I didn't look at chat, I promise.
[30:07.08]So maybe I can't... I guess I can't do anything here.
[30:28.60]Just seeing if there's any secrets or something up here.
[30:31.74]You should do a spelling bee.
[30:34.29]You know, a streamer spelling bee.
[30:36.03]Like, yeah, that would actually be pretty funny.
[30:38.53]And just pick wicked easy fucking words.
[30:41.17]I guarantee you we would eliminate half the people.
[30:44.77]Because you know how I know that?
[30:45.56]Because I know I would be eliminated by spelling like a simple five letter, four letter word.
[30:49.84]Like five letter word.
[30:50.58]I don't think you even need to go up to like seven or eight letters.
[30:54.52]I think everyone would get eliminated after like the fifth.
[30:58.70]So what did I do wrong?
[31:04.51]Is arrow pointing me back to the lodge?
[31:16.46]Where does this want me to go?
[31:19.34]I need shoes.
[31:20.83]Oh, I probably do need snow shoes.
[31:22.37]That's right.
[31:36.13]In the play testing for this game, people probably got lost.
[31:38.05]Alright.
[31:50.06]I probably need snowshoes.
[31:51.02]Okay, so then now what's the progress then?
[32:08.17]Tell the guy there was an avalanche?
[32:11.13]I did.
[32:14.91]Oh, I was checking to see if there was an avalanche.
[32:17.23]Now we have to tell the person downstairs, whoever that was, that there was not an avalanche.
[32:22.58]Now I remember.
[32:23.24]Sorry, guys.
[32:23.74]I was playing like Diablo 4 every 30 minutes.
[32:26.74]I don't even remember what happened in Diablo 4, and I played it again, too.
[32:30.84]It was pretty cool, though.
[32:35.34]Alright, where is this dude?
[32:39.07]I'm in here.
[32:49.21]Where the hell are you?
[32:52.52]Hey.
[32:52.66]I did.
[32:57.97]You make a report to the Adelaide Patrol.
[32:59.71]Spell I cup?
[33:02.07]Um, I... C... Uh, and then after that, I think there's a, um... I think after that there's a U. And then after that there's... A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P. The 16th letter of the alphabet, which is P. I think that's how it's spelled.
[33:18.97]I think I got it.
[33:21.35]Wait, what?
[33:22.51]Oh!
[33:23.07]What did you guys just tell me to... What did you tell me to spell?! !
[33:29.15]Oops, I forgot.
[33:30.63]That's okay.
[33:31.47]I'll call him.
[33:32.39]What else do you want?
[33:35.05]Oh, I'll call him.
[33:36.07]Okay.
[33:37.53]I'll get out of your hair now.
[33:39.04]Good.
[33:39.60]What?
[33:40.72]What you need.
[33:42.54]That's all the questions I had.
[33:43.70]Should I call him?
[33:44.38]I probably should call anyways.
[33:45.68]I think I should call anyways, right?
[34:11.64]I want to go this way.
[34:20.76]Well, that kind of blew it all up for me.
[34:23.66]Now what do I do?
[34:24.64]It's not the snowmobile.
[34:26.24]It's not the avalanche thing.
[34:28.75]So now what?
[34:32.25]We've been here.
[34:33.93]We've been here.
[34:35.77]We've been here.
[34:36.63]We've been here.
[34:38.31]We did this.
[34:38.97]Wait, yeah.
[34:39.41]Maybe we didn't do this, did we?
[34:45.93]Go look in people's rooms again?
[34:46.99]Okay, I guess.
[34:58.42]Okay.
[35:03.03]What's the area code, though?
[35:03.87]Because I want to call that.
[35:07.97]Why would I want this number here if it wasn't supposed to call it?
[35:16.41]555?
[35:16.49]It's 403.
[35:16.63]What was it?
[35:17.13]403.
[35:17.15]555.
[35:17.17]28.
[35:17.57]What was it?
[35:18.03]28.
[35:18.05]28.
[35:18.09]Hurry up!
[35:18.47]It's gonna go dial tone on me.
[35:19.83]28.
[35:19.85]28.
[35:19.87]28.
[35:19.89]28.
[35:19.91]28!
[35:19.93]28!
[35:19.95]2938.
[35:19.97]Oops.
[35:44.88]We're sorry.
[35:45.62]Your call cannot be completed and dialed.
[35:47.94]Please check the number and dial again.
[35:49.66]This is a recording.
[35:51.14]4-0-4-3-5-5-5-2-9-8-3.
[35:52.20]Okay.
[35:54.52]Okay.
[35:55.56]It's 2-3-8-3.
[36:17.66]Is anyone going to pick up?
[36:27.89]Well, I'm just going to grab one of these.
[36:49.39]What's the maximum amount of rings?
[36:50.65]Oh.
[36:51.96]So what's that ring?
[36:52.64]2383.
[36:55.18]It was wrong.
[36:56.10]2383.
[36:56.12]2383.
[36:56.18]What?
[36:56.40]Uh, what about 312?
[37:24.53]Oh.
[37:28.96]Yeah.
[37:36.06]God damn it.
[37:36.52]It was the first one.
[37:51.41]Check.
[37:52.61]What?
[37:53.47]No, I want one.
[37:54.65]Okay.
[38:10.00]Should we just say, I don't know, called, called Joe.
[38:21.94]There's no Joe?
[38:24.96]Joe Mama.
[38:28.14]Ban everybody writing that.
[38:29.28]I want every single person writing that right now, I want them banned from the channel.
[38:33.78]And I want them permanently five-minute banned.
[38:37.78]And what that means is that you do not get unbanned within that five minutes.
[38:42.04]So, like, it's really funny until you get permanently banned for five minutes.
[38:51.40]I don't know what the hell to do.
[38:52.24]There's the laundry bag again.
[39:02.82]I guess I'll just take it.
[39:04.00]I need like phone numbers on here.
[39:21.35]Alright.
[39:22.73]So I'm just gonna go, but I need to find... This is a granny-like.
[39:28.02]Mm-hmm.
[39:29.74]Although, not really.
[39:30.80]Granny-like means that I'm being pursued in this house while I have to do all these things.
[39:49.09]Yeah, this predates granny-likes.
[39:54.66]Make the bed.
[39:55.22]Use towels.
[39:57.68]Clean no later than noon.
[40:00.62]Okay.
[40:02.22]Nobody's even using their rooms.
[40:09.94]Is there nothing in here?
[40:10.90]There has to be something in here, right?
[40:17.82]This one has been locked.
[40:20.46]I can't even get into this one.
[40:23.20]Who's in here?
[40:26.96]It's vacant.
[40:28.26]Oh, that's why.
[40:30.20]What?
[40:34.51]It's because it's vacant.
[40:38.01]Well, that's great.
[40:38.69]Alright.
[40:39.05]Well, let me see if anybody else has anything.
[40:43.60]I have to do everybody's bed.
[40:45.60]Alright.
[40:45.98]Fine, fine, fine, fine.
[41:03.03]There you go.
[41:03.47]Okay.
[41:04.17]There's four rooms that need it today.
[41:05.75]What's this?
[41:17.34]Oh!
[41:19.02]Interesting.
[41:21.71]This room is studying wolves.
[41:24.59]Hmm.
[41:26.51]Why do you have this book?
[41:32.92]Okay.
[41:34.22]And you're a sculptor.
[41:36.70]Interesting.
[41:38.78]Who's in this room?
[41:43.01]I can ask a few questions about that, I think.
[41:46.59]Who is in this room?
[41:53.49]Okay, this is... Who the hell's in here?
[42:05.31]Oh, Lou, okay, Lou Talbot.
[42:08.72]Lou Talbot.
[42:11.68]Interesting.
[42:12.94]Okay.
[42:17.18]Did they make this a, is this a children's game?
[42:19.50]Is the person that had the wolf book in their room the one to be like, you are, like, you like wolves.
[42:24.92]Yes, I do.
[42:25.84]And you did it.
[42:26.64]Yes, I did.
[42:27.36]Is that like the smoking gun in a way?
[42:29.63]I have to imagine it might be.
[42:40.35]Okay, give me your laundry.
[42:45.46]Nice.
[42:48.58]I can't get into anybody else's closets.
[42:53.48]Unless... Wait.
[42:57.00]Nope.
[43:09.63]You forgot to put all the laundry in that bag.
[43:15.01]No, I got it all actually.
[43:29.50]Okay.
[43:31.56]Are there people down here now hanging out that I can talk to?
[43:33.74]I'm just gonna call Lou on the phone.
[43:40.70]Okay.
[43:41.16]Oh, you're Lou.
[43:42.06]I have...
[43:59.22]As a matter of fact, I have.
[44:01.10]Excellent.
[44:01.94]Here's the deal.
[44:03.00]I need some competition, so I want you to go out there and try to catch a bigger fish than I caught yesterday, which means you gotta catch a two-foot northern pike.
[44:11.64]Now, it's a bit of a hike out to the lake, but the shack is solar-heated, so it's nice and warm inside.
[44:16.80]So what do you say, kiddo?
[44:18.20]You game?
[44:19.12]Anything to make you guests happy.
[44:21.25]Atta girl.
[44:24.06]Well, I'll let you get back to meeting Lou.
[44:26.02]Do I need a place to keep it or no?
[44:28.64]What's up?
[44:30.81]So you go to school in California?
[44:33.03]Yep.
[44:33.93]University of California at Brea.
[44:36.61]What degree are you working on?
[44:39.25]Master of Fine Arts.
[44:40.39]Hmm.
[44:42.31]What's your favorite medium?
[44:43.65]Cool.
[44:44.33]So what's your favorite medium?
[44:45.83]Holograms.
[44:46.35]What is this, like the Spanish Inquisition?
[44:48.91]Hey, give her a break.
[44:51.07]She's just trying to make pleasant conversation.
[44:54.49]Dirt.
[45:02.96]You paint with dirt?
[45:04.76]I create works of art by manipulating naturally occurring geophysical substances like dirt.
[45:10.34]Sometimes I just use my hands, but most of the time heavy machinery is involved.
[45:13.63]So you're blowing up pieces of the Earth.
[45:16.25]You're like burying grenades and taking... To be great is to be misunderstood.
[45:22.76]FYI, Ralph Waldo Emerson said that.
[45:26.04]Yeah.
[45:26.72]Yeah.
[45:27.00]You are like using explosives to create art in like out in the wilderness or something, right?
[45:32.74]I think that might be what it is.
[45:39.11]Is this your first time at the lodge?
[45:41.21]Yep.
[45:41.93]My car broke down on my way to Lake Louise last summer.
[45:44.93]Pulled in here to wait for the tow truck and figured it'd be a cool place to visit during the winter.
[45:49.09]So here I am.
[45:56.20]Alright, well let's go catch the fish.
[45:57.70]At least that's what we know we have to do.
[46:00.52]I can't wait to have to play somebody in this because you know I'm gonna have to and I don't want to.
[46:08.87]I already went over this, but this is from the oldest RPGs.
[46:16.44]Like, D&D taught us this.
[46:18.32]Like, almost a hundred years ago.
[46:21.16]People are good at stuff.
[46:23.59]The whole reason for, like, a party system is because everybody's good at different things.
[46:28.61]I don't want to be the chef.
[46:29.99]I don't want to be the manager.
[46:31.80]I don't want to be the performer at the fucking comedy club that's down the street.
[46:36.54]We all do the things that we're good at.
[46:38.16]That's why RPGs have taught us anything.
[46:40.48]Alright, how do I get back to the lake?
[46:52.78]Is it this way?
[46:55.37]Call the avalanche patrol?
[46:56.37]Uh, I was going to, but that guy said he was going to do it anyways.
[47:03.26]You are literally a performer at a comedy club.
[47:06.24]You don't see me cooking, do you?
[47:08.20]You don't see my, like, unbelievable chef skills.
[47:10.94]No, you don't.
[47:13.68]You don't see me, um, you know, I'm not, I can't, I can't really let him cook.
[47:20.88]Let him cook.
[47:22.16]No, you don't really want me to.
[47:35.98]What about the egg salad?
[47:37.95]Well, the egg salad only requires a very small amount of cooking.
[47:40.47]Alright, I need a map.
[47:45.23]I figured if I spun her around a few times, she wouldn't know where she was either.
[48:03.87]I'm not going back there.
[48:04.85]Oh, yeah, actually you know what you spun me around enough times that actually seems pretty safe.
[48:07.97]Let's go that way No more avalanches for me.
[48:14.78]Thank you very much What was that lake I feel like I got lost accidentally and found my way to that lake You were literally on a cooking stream Yes, yes, I was
[48:32.17]Would you have eaten any of the food that Charlie and I made?
[48:41.76]Okay, so... What's the point there?
[48:46.96]Aren't you making the point for me?
[48:48.16]I need to look at a map.
[49:02.19]Because this is... Oh, here it is.
[49:03.57]I got it.
[49:04.25]Oh, come on.
[49:05.66]Alright.
[49:05.96]I got it.
[49:06.30]It's the skating pond.
[49:07.06]Is this the skating pond?
[49:08.76]Nancy, get in the house.
[49:16.42]Oh, my God.
[49:17.04]I just clicked off of it.
[49:17.92]Okay.
[49:32.91]Go right back out here.
[49:35.46]Is it the skating pond?
[49:41.42]Past the skating pond.
[49:42.64]Save the game.
[49:43.88]Good call.
[49:50.65]It was, wasn't it?
[49:51.31]I don't remember.
[50:01.84]No, it's not.
[50:03.20]It was like a weird hut.
[50:05.82]It was like a shack.
[50:07.64]And I remember being like, how did I even get here?
[50:20.05]It's past the snowball fight area.
[50:26.45]It's not that way.
[50:29.27]Which way?
[50:32.90]I better not follow this trail until I know for sure where it goes.
[50:35.94]I don't... Does anybody remember over here?
[50:39.89]Stop!
[50:42.43]How dare you trespass here!
[50:44.37]You shall pay for your insolence!
[50:47.41]Help!
[50:48.79]Help!
[50:50.63]Help!
[51:04.79]Oh, nice hit.
[51:07.45]Nice job.
[51:08.65]Oh, look out.
[51:10.45]Oh, it got me.
[51:12.45]Let me buy.
[51:12.93]Now, let me buy.
[51:13.55]Now, get out of the way.
[51:14.81]Now, get out of the way.
[51:15.92]Get out of the way.
[51:16.70]Thank you.
[51:17.02]It was fun.
[51:17.64]Very fun time.
[51:30.00]If I don't get warm soon, I may not make it.
[51:33.76]Alright, well, hurry up.
[51:35.32]Okay.
[51:38.48]Catch the fish.
[51:38.80]What?
[51:38.90]It's definitely one of the two of them, then.
[51:40.02]There's somebody one step ahead of me.
[51:41.14]It's one of those two.
[51:54.95]Hmm.
[51:55.65]Left behind by whoever trashed this place, maybe?
[51:58.11]Birds of the Southwest.
[51:59.67]202-555-7237.
[52:00.01]Okay.
[52:01.37]That's a U.S.
[52:04.00]phone number.
[52:04.60]Alright.
[52:06.52]Calling that.
[52:19.15]Alright.
[52:19.45]Get me out of here.
[52:31.92]Uninstall Diablo 4, please.
[52:33.82]Why?
[52:34.84]It's Lou.
[52:35.26]It's definitely Lou.
[52:37.14]A note.
[52:44.45]Nancy Drew.
[53:01.72]Hmm.
[53:04.94]Hey, Nancy.
[53:06.16]I really like playing snowball fights with you, but I'm afraid you won't want to play with me anymore.
[53:11.11]If you play with me and win, I'll give you my top secret way I can... Oh, this is the little kid.
[53:15.49]Never mind.
[53:15.87]I thought this was like a mastermind criminal or something.
[53:19.57]I'll give you my top secret way I can stay out in the cold for so long.
[53:23.03]Wait, wait.
[53:24.31]Freddy.
[53:24.55]Okay.
[53:27.93]Okay.
[53:42.13]I better not follow this trail until I know for sure where it goes.
[53:48.12]Hold!
[53:48.74]By order of the Snow Princess, you shall not pass!
[53:53.24]Wait, where are- Help!
[53:55.58]Help!
[53:57.39]Help!
[54:05.22]Do this voice.
[54:15.19]What did you throw at me?
[54:16.73]I didn't even see it.
[54:25.47]What did I even get?
[54:29.87]What is that?
[54:31.93]What the f- No, I don't want to use it right now!
[54:35.03]What is that?
[54:35.53]I didn't want to even take that.
[54:37.89]What drugs did I just take?
[54:39.53]What did I just take?
[54:43.35]This, I'm gonna... I may have soft... Did I softlock myself or something?
[54:46.25]Was it a hand warmer?
[54:54.29]Why did I use it?
[54:57.11]What just happened?
[55:10.92]Alright, let's make the call.
[55:11.90]202-555... 7237.
[55:14.72]God damn it.
[55:19.14]Two... What is it?
[55:19.78]202-555... 202-7237.
[55:51.50]You have reached Run and Grow Free, a nonprofit organization dedicated to making sure that the wild animals of North America remain wild.
[55:59.84]No one can take your call at the moment because all of our volunteer staff is busy blocking access to California's wilderness areas in order to protect their cougar, bear, and condor populations.
[56:10.78]But if you leave your name and number after the beep, someone will eventually get back to you, especially if you want to make a donation.
[56:18.71]Okay.
[56:22.75]Interesting.
[56:26.05]Interesting.
[56:27.25]So.
[56:27.49]Okay.
[56:34.24]Lou?
[56:39.80]Where's Lou?
[56:42.92]Lou?
[56:49.29]What's up?
[56:51.01]Who had... Has he been here the whole time with you?
[56:53.99]Yep.
[57:13.07]completely so much for our little fishing contest wait a minute ollie ice fishes go ask him for a hook and line and don't take no for an answer oh okay I'll see you two later okay where's ollie drop by who's ollie I don't know who that is I just learned these two people's names into long term memory like five minutes ago so actually I don't even know the person on the right is
[57:45.21]If you told me, Jerma, I'll give you a million dollars right now, tell me this guy's full name, I wouldn't be able to do it.
[57:50.89]I don't think I wouldn't be able to do it.
[57:51.99]Even if you said it, I'll give you a million dollars.
[57:55.55]I have no, I don't know what his first name is.
[57:56.99]I have no idea.
[57:59.61]I know this is Lou.
[58:00.67]I don't know.
[58:10.30]It's time to serve lunch now.
[58:11.95]Not time for kitchen duty yet.
[58:13.79]Okay.
[58:14.87]So, I need to go find Ollie.
[58:17.25]Who's Ollie?
[58:19.49]Is Ollie this person down here?
[58:20.71]There's two people down here.
[58:22.29]Is this Ollie?
[58:23.73]Ah, I'm glad for the chance to talk once again.
[58:26.69]There is something I must explain.
[58:28.89]Sure.
[58:30.27]There is?
[58:31.10]What I said before about wolves.
[58:33.50]It is because my grandmother was killed by wolves.
[58:36.34]Killed and devoured.
[58:41.46]Okay.
[58:41.94]Are you serious?
[58:43.38]Years ago, when my mother was a little girl, her mother, my grandmother, was on her way back from the village on her motor scooter, which was and still is the only means of transportation most Fredonians can afford.
[58:56.65]It was January and the sun had just set and it was dark, very cold.
[59:02.41]There were thousands of wolves in the countryside that winter.
[59:05.67]At night, they would roam in huge, hungry packs.
[59:08.93]my grandmother was halfway home when she came upon a young man waving from the side of the road for her to stop wait a minute he too had been on a scooter but his had broken down and wolves were gathering all around him preparing to attack my grandmother of course stopped and he leapt on behind her and they took off down the road with the wolves dozens of them chasing after them but with two people riding it her scooter was slow much too slow and the wolves soon caught up with them
[59:36.70]If she died, how do you know that's what happened?
[59:59.98]tormented by guilt the young man eventually confessed he went to prison for several years and the wolves were hunted year-round until the countryside was rid of them but the damage was done I don't think that's what happened to you about any subject except wolves about yeah I have nothing to say you ever see lou talbot when you're out there training
[60:23.57]Ever see Lou Talbot when you're out there training?
[60:26.09]The college student?
[60:27.65]Just yesterday I had to slow down to avoid... It ruined my whole session.
[60:35.36]Chantal would like to use your name and picture on her website when she gets it up.
[60:39.56]Would that be okay?
[60:40.78]I'm sorry, but no.
[60:42.14]Guilty.
[60:42.66]Oh, well, so much for that.
[60:47.66]I have disturbed you long enough.
[60:49.02]We've got some more info.
[60:57.20]Why do I feel like this is in slow motion?
[61:02.26]I'm hearing slow motion artifact sounds.
[61:09.52]Does it sound like that?
[61:18.95]What you need?
[61:21.00]Someone went into the ice fishing shack and ruined all of Bill Kessler's equipment.
[61:23.72]Someone went into the ice fishing shack and ruined all of Bill Kessler's equipment.
[61:27.96]Probably some animal-loving eco-fanatic who figured it was time to save the fish.
[61:34.68]How am I going to catch... Problem is, Mr. Kessler still insists that I try to catch a two-foot northern pike.
[61:41.41]Say no more.
[61:42.92]There's my tackle box.
[61:44.16]Oh, yes.
[61:45.72]Yes.
[61:46.74]Me into competing with him.
[61:48.38]But I can't very well do that when you've got my hook in line now, can I?
[61:52.24]No, I don't suppose you can.
[61:54.54]What else do you want?
[61:55.76]That's it.
[61:56.68]That's all the questions I had.
[61:58.30]By the way, you dumped the laundry bag before all the rooms were cleaned.
[62:02.13]So I put it back up at the front desk.
[62:04.23]How is that even possible?
[62:05.07]I don't even care.
[62:08.54]If that's not game breaking, game progress breaking, I'm not doing it ever again.
[62:13.68]I don't care.
[62:14.12]Yeah, okay, come on, kid.
[62:39.81]I feel like this is Groundhog Day, and I have to do this every day.
[62:42.65]Eventually, see, I've gotten so good at this, because this is like the 5,000th time I've had to do this.
[62:48.49]Whatever you really call, just squeeze the toasty pack and you'll get a burst of heat.
[63:02.90]It only works when you're already cold, as you can only use one toasty.
[63:09.11]I love this voice.
[63:10.05]I want to hear more of it.
[63:11.91]I like it.
[63:12.41]I like this voice.
[63:15.01]It's cute.
[63:18.05]It's like... Imagine if I do.
[63:26.74]It is really, really cold out here.
[63:29.67]It sounds like Cartman.
[63:36.01]alright let's do what we were supposed to do an hour ago so close darn two two feet right it's Dark Souls two uh majula it does it you'll hear it wrong again
[64:05.33]You'll hear it.
[64:05.87]It goes... It does it for one... It's one part of the song.
[64:15.69]Not this part.
[64:20.45]Yes, it does.
[64:20.84]Just wait.
[64:49.47]Never mind.
[64:51.64]It goes... And then that's it.
[64:55.60]It does it for one part of the song.
[65:03.65]I mean, I'm a Plastic Beach fan, so... I think that's one of my favorite albums.
[65:14.51]Also, the vodka pineapple.
[65:16.61]It's super good.
[65:17.53]It's not a whole lot of bullshit.
[65:19.23]It's what I drink.
[65:19.89]Oh, no!
[65:41.67]That one looks pretty good.
[65:43.33]Rats too small.
[65:49.16]That was that's it.
[65:50.00]Oh, come on.
[65:55.02]There was.
[65:55.40]That won't do.
[66:14.85]Shit.
[66:16.91]It's not- it's not that one.
[66:18.15]There we go!
[66:18.93]Yay!
[66:19.45]A two-foot northern pike.
[66:20.87]No more fishing for me!
[66:21.97]Friendly gameplay, ResidentSleeper.
[66:26.05]Hold on a second.
[66:29.42]Somebody resident sleep with Nancy Drew.
[66:31.26]I can't- wait a second here.
[66:38.78]Okay.
[66:41.92]Okay.
[66:43.08]Alright.
[66:50.02]The skin is shattering.
[66:52.42]What the fuck did he throw at me?
[66:54.03]What did he fucking throw at me?
[66:54.83]Huh?
[66:54.91]What?
[66:55.07]You're the worst detective I've ever heard of.
[67:25.12]But wait.
[67:25.46]Nancy.
[67:26.06]Nancy, somebody... Oh, hold on.
[67:26.76]What the hell is happening here?
[67:27.80]Go.
[67:27.94]How do I get over there?
[67:54.86]How do I get over there?
[68:03.20]What?
[68:11.70]I can't reach it.
[68:12.52]There's no...
[68:27.61]I didn't know you could go diagonal.
[68:30.09]Those weren't even touching.
[68:41.88]First of all, I need to talk about this for a second.
[68:46.72]Nancy, if somebody throws a snowball at you, and then the room you are in explodes, it wasn't a snowball.
[69:00.63]Oh no, somebody threw a snowball at me and something blew up.
[69:03.28]I must have caused an explosion.
[69:30.07]How am I supposed to do this?
[69:35.47]What are we trying to do here?
[69:39.45]That is what... Okay.
[69:43.62]I have to step on this one to be able to get up there.
[69:48.96]I understand how it works now.
[69:49.92]We just gotta get over there quick.
[70:01.04]What's going on?
[70:21.51]Come on!
[70:22.14]Get up there!
[70:23.44]Spawn one up there!
[70:38.29]Is there a rhyme or reason to how this works?
[70:42.77]Because I stepped on that one last time and it spawned one up here.
[70:51.58]This is just RNG.
[70:53.52]Okay, so if I go diagonal, then it spawned that over there.
[71:06.04]What if I go diagonal again?
[71:09.00]Um...
[71:52.76]Is the idea to make it so you fill in these so then it has nowhere else to go?
[72:00.11]Makes the next one over appear or disappear.
[72:07.89]I think it's random.
[72:15.02]Is that one... Okay.
[72:17.90]Then... Okay.
[72:19.88]Okay.
[72:33.12]I can't use the heat pack.
[72:34.02]It's almost there.
[72:37.18]Alright, just make my way over there.
[72:38.04]Come on, go, go, go, go, go.
[72:52.01]Come on, do it already.
[73:06.36]What the fuck?
[73:12.75]I'd be freaking out if I were you, dude.
[73:15.43]I'm alright.
[73:16.03]I just don't.
[73:16.83]Is there a pattern?
[73:19.09]It doesn't feel like there is.
[73:20.95]If I go down, what happens?
[73:22.78]It takes that one down.
[73:23.78]If I go up, it takes the one above me.
[73:26.38]If I go down, will it reappear?
[73:29.20]No, it won't.
[73:31.23]So what if I go left?
[73:33.37]What if I go right?
[73:35.15]Okay.
[73:36.17]Left again.
[73:36.99]Up.
[73:38.43]Okay.
[73:38.91]Alright.
[73:39.21]Wait, wait, wait.
[73:39.53]I think I'm starting to understand what's going on here.
[73:41.51]Alright.
[73:41.85]Alright.
[73:42.15]Alright.
[73:42.49]Okay.
[73:42.79]So what is making it?
[73:51.66]So why did that spawn down there?
[74:12.36]Is it the opposite side?
[74:13.54]I don't know.
[74:14.68]Diagonal, down, left, middle?
[74:20.49]No, it's definitely not random.
[74:21.81]It's, okay.
[74:22.63]Well, how do I know if it's going to move one or not?
[74:26.55]If I go down, it takes the one below where I land.
[74:28.83]If I go up, it takes below.
[74:29.89]If I go left, it takes the next one.
[74:31.11]If I go right, diagonal is the only thing throwing me off.
[75:12.57]Is that it?
[75:12.87]Did I get it?
[75:13.25]I think that's it.
[75:16.89]Is that it?
[75:17.25]Fuck you!
[75:23.90]The blocks of ice are laid out in a grid pattern with horizontal, vertical, and diagonal rows.
[75:28.34]If Nancy moves along a horizontal row, then random ice flows in that row will appear or disappear.
[75:34.12]If she moves in a vertical, then it will be ice flows in the column that appear.
[75:38.60]The same applies... Ugh.
[75:43.50]Is this pre-recorded?
[75:44.28]No.
[75:44.34]You know what I was about to say to you.
[75:50.54]I stopped myself.
[75:52.29]I stopped myself from saying... Have you been on this for an hour?
[75:59.43]No, I just don't... We're fine, alright?
[76:03.01]I am starting to understand how...
[76:12.22]So I want to go diagonal because I want it to... Hold on.
[76:14.64]I want to like fill in the next diagonal spot, right?
[76:18.70]If I go like that, then it'll have to... Okay.
[76:26.79]Fill it in again.
[76:27.25]Do it again.
[76:33.44]Fill it in.
[76:41.96]It's just so cold.
[76:43.36]The rooming one lets you place one.
[77:12.10]Got it.
[77:13.68]I don't know whose this is or why that wolf left it here, but at least now I won't freeze to death.
[77:19.92]Whose jacket is this?
[77:22.78]I feel warmer already.
[77:24.68]There's a note in one of the pockets.
[77:35.84]Swear word.
[77:41.84]Since I can't go back the way I came, maybe these tracks will lead me to shelter.
[77:48.63]Beautiful mountain range.
[77:56.25]Beautiful mountain range.
[78:01.33]Avalanche Ridge.
[78:03.35]Not exactly reassuring.
[78:05.99]At this point that I look up, I cup my hands to my mouth and I go.
[78:10.64]Just fucking wait and see what happens.
[78:11.64]Oh, I know where to get those.
[78:12.46]Reuse joke, do better.
[78:12.94]There's like 10,000 people that weren't here when I did that like two years ago.
[78:16.68]Stop it.
[78:53.36]What's this place called?
[78:54.68]Avalanche Ridge.
[78:55.92]Alright, so I gotta get the snowshoes to go to Avalanche Ridge.
[79:09.57]I can't stop shivering.
[79:11.99]I need to get in and out of the cold like soon.
[79:14.79]All I want to do is lie down.
[79:19.12]What?
[79:19.96]No, get... Wait, eat the thing.
[79:25.16]Eat the hand warmers.
[79:26.16]No, don't eat them, but... Hypothermia claims Icicle Creek Lodge employee.
[79:34.42]what avalanche ridge not exactly reassuring ski tracks probably yanni's I bet if I follow them I'll wind up back at the lodge I was right nobody's gonna look out the window and see Nancy Drew is like blue with icicles all over her face and so come on was nobody aware
[80:01.14]I feel warmer already.
[80:01.98]We're good.
[80:02.54]Lunchtime?
[80:03.78]I got it.
[80:04.02]I got this.
[80:04.38]Don't worry.
[80:21.05]Oh, wait.
[80:32.98]Somebody's sleeping.
[80:37.10]Well, who are you?
[80:39.97]Well, keep it down.
[80:40.63]Somebody's sleeping over there.
[80:44.03]I'm Elsa's replacement?
[80:46.53]Oh, the new maid.
[80:47.63]Thank goodness.
[80:48.95]I was wondering how much longer the owner expected us to endure these conditions and still pay full price.
[80:57.37]I'm trying to learn everyone's name.
[80:58.67]What's your name?
[80:59.35]My name is Guadalupe Comillo.
[81:01.91]My friends call me Lupe.
[81:03.47]Hmm.
[81:06.20]So I should call you Lupe?
[81:08.10]I hardly think so, dear.
[81:09.92]Yeah.
[81:10.16]For one thing, I don't even know your name.
[81:12.96]My name's Nancy Drew.
[81:14.66]Wonderful.
[81:15.88]Now, be a doll and clean my room first.
[81:18.53]It'll hardly take you any time at all.
[81:20.67]Especially compared to the other rooms.
[81:22.73]The other guests are all men.
[81:25.13]Single men.
[81:26.82]Well, I'm happy to report that I've already cleaned your room.
[81:30.23]Excellent.
[81:33.37]What are you doing?
[81:33.77]I hate to sound nosy, but what are you doing?
[81:36.91]Birds.
[81:37.97]I'm watching birds.
[81:39.53]That's what I am, you see, a bird watcher.
[81:42.34]Sometimes I go outside and watch, and sometimes I stay inside.
[81:46.78]It all depends on what the birds feel like doing and what I feel like doing.
[81:51.51]She fucked up the, she fucked up the shack.
[81:55.53]That was, remember the bird newspaper with the number on it?
[81:57.44]There was a bird magazine.
[82:02.67]Hmm.
[82:05.87]So that's what brought you to Icicle Creek Lodge, the birding?
[82:08.91]Absolutely.
[82:10.19]The place is a veritable birding Paradise, even in winter.
[82:14.44]In fact, in the short time I've been here, I've seen hawks, eagles, orioles, cardinals, jays.
[82:20.94]I was just going to say, oh yeah, name three birds.
[82:23.70]I should have said it.
[82:26.84]I was holding it until the conversation was over.
[82:29.96]I was right about to say, oh yeah, name three birds.
[82:32.14]That would have been really funny.
[82:33.83]I was holding it because I didn't want to talk over the conversation.
[82:37.61]Well, okay.
[82:38.29]Well, you named three birds.
[82:39.39]There you go.
[82:40.31]Have you met the other guests?
[82:42.09]I've bumped into them at one time or another.
[82:44.29]Yes, I don't spend all my time in front of this window.
[82:47.94]That Yanni fellow, he's very talented, but extremely intense.
[82:52.30]His whole life revolves around being the best in the world.
[82:55.86]As for the two who are always sitting across the way playing that silly game, the older man, Bill Kessler, he's no deep thinker, but he's nice enough.
[83:05.11]But the other one, that college student, talking to him is like trying to converse with a giant turnip.
[83:10.97]You hiding booze in there?
[83:13.02]You hiding booze in there?
[83:13.80]I almost prefer talking to the handyman.
[83:16.18]Almost.
[83:17.32]Anyone that intent on destroying something as glorious as that wolf is hardly worth talking to.
[83:24.38]Somebody said it's a little quiet.
[83:25.22]Let me turn it up.
[83:26.64]Let me know if that's better.
[83:28.82]Have you ever seen the wolf?
[83:34.25]Have you ever seen the wolf that's been hanging out around here?
[83:37.45]No.
[83:38.55]Not that I'm looking for it.
[83:39.79]Of course, Yanni occasionally skis by and that duller student, I see him snowshoeing occasionally.
[83:48.02]But I've yet to see the wolf.
[83:50.66]Have you seen it?
[83:53.46]hmm no you see I yeah I have yeah up close and personal as a matter of fact how did it act was it aggressive did it look injured you seem to really want to know a lot about this wolf even though you claim to not really care and you're hiding booze in those binoculars I think I don't know
[84:16.83]Actually, I think it may have saved my life.
[84:19.47]Really?
[84:20.68]Of course, its behavior does suggest that it's had contact with humans before.
[84:24.92]Have you told anyone else what you just told me?
[84:28.62]No.
[84:29.32]Good.
[84:30.06]Don't.
[84:31.14]You see, I'd like to see this wolf for myself, and I don't want everyone else going after it and scaring it away.
[84:38.63]Okay, I have to tell everybody.
[84:39.57]There's no telling what that trigger-happy handyman might do.
[84:42.93]So it'll just be our little secret, alright?
[84:47.34]no no um no because I'm not going to end up with a kitchen knife in my back in 10 minutes I'm going to tell everybody do you want a book about birds of the southwest I might why do you ask hmm so I just like just totally just throw this whole thing under the bus and just be like well because I know what you're doing I know everything and I know there's booze in there
[85:15.46]Because I found a piece of a book cover in the fishing shack.
[85:18.60]And since it was about birds, I wondered if it was yours.
[85:22.14]No, it's not from any book I have.
[85:25.44]I've never been in the ice fishing shack.
[85:27.16]So how could it be?
[85:29.17]Yeah, but it forgot the whole part where I walk up to the window, get out a cigarette, like start smoking the cigarette and then telling her about the magazine that I found in the shack.
[85:43.00]Well, there was a magazine in the shack that had a lot of things about birds in it.
[85:48.22]And, well, I mean, not too many people around these parts really love birds as much as some people I've talked to recently.
[85:54.93]Have a good afternoon.
[85:57.57]And I make wicked loud fucking walking sounds.
[85:59.97]There's like jingling on my person.
[86:02.61]You know what I mean?
[86:06.34]Just like... Like I just... There's like coins in my... I make noise whenever I go anywhere.
[86:12.73]Good luck with your birding.
[86:13.71]Au revoir.
[86:18.19]Is this yours?
[86:20.73]Sorry, let me get my fucking 200 caliber sniper rifle I dropped on the ground.
[86:27.28]I wonder what you're doing out here.
[86:30.20]What, that bullet?
[86:31.60]Don't be silly.
[86:32.42]Why would I be carrying ammunition around?
[86:36.66]Okay, well then where did this just come from?
[86:38.86]It was probably lying there on the floor all along and you just happened to kick it into view, that's all.
[86:43.97]This did used to be a hunting lodge, dear.
[86:46.49]I wouldn't worry about it.
[86:49.14]Yeah, I'm telling you, if I was ever a detective, I'm having, I'm putting a bunch of coins in my pocket.
[86:54.88]I'm gonna walk around with, like, a tambourine.
[86:57.34]I'm gonna make sure that, like, I'm gonna wear, like, leather, so it makes, like, I'm gonna be fucking loud as fuck if I go anywhere.
[87:04.68]I'm gonna be making all kinds of noise.
[87:07.48]Like, I'm gonna lean down to stretch and look at, like, where the body was.
[87:10.79]Yeah, interesting.
[87:16.57]Light up a cigarette.
[87:19.19]How'd they die?
[87:25.94]I'm just gonna accuse this?
[87:27.08]Am I an accuser of this?
[87:33.17]You used that bullet I found on the floor to alter the sights on Ollie Randall's rifle, didn't you?
[87:38.57]What?
[87:39.41]That's so ridiculous.
[87:40.81]It's laughable.
[87:43.63]Worst joke?
[87:44.93]Why?
[87:45.31]I thought it was humorous.
[87:49.03]You did it because you're a member of the Run and Grow Free and you're trying to protect the wolf at any cost, aren't you?
[87:54.64]That's why you have that magazine in your room.
[87:56.60]So you can figure out how to keep Ollie Randall from shooting the wolf.
[88:01.40]These are both of the same thing, aren't they?
[88:09.68]If you didn't find this bullet, it would have ended up in your back.
[88:20.96]you did it because you're a member of run and grow free and you're trying to protect the wolf at any cost aren't you look at me do I really look like some kind of wildlife fanatic I never judge books by their covers miss cameo look I don't want to see anything happen to that wolf either if you belong to run and grow free just tell me I'm good at keeping secrets believe me
[88:43.57]You're right.
[88:45.49]I'm a detective.
[88:46.71]Aren't I trying to make sure that brute would miss if he took a shot at the wolf?
[88:50.33]And I will do whatever it takes to protect that beautiful creature.
[88:55.73]Hey, we're talking about a potential crime that's being committed, but just tell me.
[88:59.57]I mean, just tell me the crime you're committing.
[89:02.27]I can keep it secret.
[89:03.19]So you're here undercover?
[89:10.71]Yes.
[89:15.41]What are you gonna do next?
[89:16.49]R1 R1 R1 R1 R1
[89:52.46]hey hey you wouldn't believe what the is going on in this lodge can I talk to you Nancy hi what the heck happened out there actually I'm not quite sure I walked out to icicle lake to see how you were doing in the fishing shack only there wasn't any fishing shack there wasn't even a lake the ice was all busted up like somebody dropped a bomb on it
[90:17.01]I wouldn't want to be told any of this shit.
[90:41.85]I mean, I don't know if like a detective came up to me and was like, hey, hey, listen to all this shit that's going on.
[90:46.99]Hey, by the way, I know it's her.
[90:49.29]It'd be like, who?
[90:51.08]Oh, hey, the lady by the window with the binoculars.
[90:53.76]Watch the fuck out.
[90:55.16]It's like, oh, but arrest her.
[90:59.16]What are you talking about?
[90:59.98]Yeah, by the way, I just want to let you know she dropped a bullet.
[91:09.29]What?
[91:09.47]What?
[91:10.93]Yeah, sure, I don't- I'm not supposed to tell anybody.
[91:14.61]You're not a cop.
[91:17.86]Oh.
[91:18.50]No, that's right.
[91:20.64]I'm just like a... investigative enthusiast.
[91:27.18]Right?
[91:27.46]What is Nancy Drew's career- What's Nancy Drew for a career?
[91:31.60]You're literally like 16.
[91:37.25]Nancy Drew is just like a teenager.
[91:47.42]Oh.
[91:52.71]She's a true crime podcast fan.
[91:56.94]Oh.
[92:03.81]Since Mr. Talbot isn't here, could I play a game of fox and geese with you?
[92:07.49]You bet.
[92:08.21]Have a seat.
[92:09.21]Here are the rules.
[92:10.05]Oh no, I don't want to do this.
[92:12.37]The black piece is the fox.
[92:14.19]The goal of the geese is to corner the fox so he can't move, while the goal of the fox is to gobble up geese so that they can't corner him.
[92:21.25]The geese can only move forward along a line to the next point, either directly forwards, diagonally, or sideways.
[92:27.32]You gotta slow down.
[92:28.00]Same thing for the fox, except when he's next to a goose that has an empty spot directly behind it.
[92:32.74]You can jump over it.
[92:34.18]Gobble it up.
[92:35.40]Right.
[92:35.94]Gobble it up and remove it from the board.
[92:38.20]Dave.
[92:38.36]You just take turns and play until somebody wins and somebody loses.
[92:41.84]Dave, I just found a bullet on the ground.
[92:43.73]I don't want to do this.
[92:46.07]No, I don't.
[92:47.11]I really don't want to do this.
[92:49.43]I don't.
[92:51.49]The goal is to... Let me read this for a minute.
[92:59.77]Okay.
[93:00.63]Goal of the geese is to corner the fox so he can't move.
[93:04.91]Goal of the fox is to gobble up the geese so they can't corner him.
[93:09.19]The geese can only move forward along a line to the next point.
[93:12.52]So the geese can only move forward.
[93:13.94]They can't go diagonal.
[93:17.90]No, they can go diagonal, but they can only move one space.
[93:21.46]Except when he's next to a goose that has an empty spot behind it, he can just brute force the puzzle.
[93:27.38]Because it can't be that hard.
[93:31.94]What team am I on?
[94:30.51]No!
[94:40.98]Restart.
[94:41.38]I don't... I... I hate these things.
[94:46.90]If I walk by and there's a puzzle like this being played, I walk right by it.
[94:50.84]Or I lean over to two people playing it and I go, Oh, interesting.
[94:54.95]You want to play?
[94:55.49]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[94:57.23]You guys are doing pretty sick.
[94:58.41]You guys are good.
[94:59.07]I don't play... I would never play this.
[95:01.71]I would glance over and say, cool.
[95:04.11]And then I would never talk about it ever again.
[95:15.12]Whatever.
[95:15.62]It doesn't matter.
[95:16.04]There.
[95:19.80]Now you... Okay, I have to restart.
[95:25.11]I gotta back away.
[95:26.71]Okay, we start over.
[95:29.94]Oh my god.
[95:31.48]Okay.
[95:31.94]What is the... What's the... I... I know it's about like patience and... And I have none of that.
[96:06.32]Watch this spot down here.
[96:07.38]Alright, you can't- you cannot go anywhere.
[96:12.88]I've got you locked right here.
[96:15.56]Actually can't do anything.
[96:16.62]Cannot go anywhere.
[96:17.90]Now we close it in.
[96:21.47]Slowly close it in.
[96:25.03]You can't go that way.
[96:25.77]Alright, if you go up, you could take that out.
[96:32.61]If you go up, you- alright.
[96:35.75]Slowly close it in.
[96:41.65]Okay.
[96:56.36]Okay, now...
[97:32.50]No!
[97:33.98]Oh!
[97:34.50]No, no, no, no, no.
[97:35.10]I got it, I got it.
[97:35.75]Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[97:36.83]I don't... I fucking don't know.
[97:38.43]I fucked it up.
[97:42.79]It's okay.
[97:44.75]You actually can't go anywhere.
[97:49.37]Okay, now... I got greedy.
[98:02.89]I win.
[98:06.05]I win.
[98:13.66]Not yet.
[98:14.38]I need to... Did I win?
[98:15.60]But will... I think he'll just jump it.
[98:19.60]Won't he just jump it?
[98:29.24]Oh my god, what just happened?
[98:30.66]I fucking hate this.
[98:31.46]I want to delete this so bad.
[98:32.62]I would flip the table at this point.
[98:33.72]I don't know what just happened.
[98:35.74]I fucking hate this shit.
[98:37.08]I never play these.
[98:38.20]I avoid these.
[98:39.08]I avoid them because I don't want to play these.
[98:43.05]I don't play checkers.
[98:44.47]I don't play chess.
[98:45.65]I've had people ask me, oh, are you interested in playing chess?
[98:47.55]No, zero.
[98:48.55]It's big brains.
[98:50.01]A lot of brains involved.
[98:51.01]I'm not saying I have a small brain.
[98:52.48]I'm just saying I have a very particular brain that does particular things pretty well.
[98:55.44]This is not one of them.
[98:56.95]I had it.
[98:57.85]Dude, I know I had it.
[98:59.77]You know that I understand that?
[99:01.69]Don't save it.
[99:03.23]Just quit and start over.
[99:04.75]Okay, we start over.
[99:05.83]I hate these fucking things.
[99:09.73]It's not even hard.
[99:10.47]It's just like, yeah, I have to sit there and just like...
[99:28.23]I thought I just won.
[99:28.91]This game is best for ages 9 and up.
[99:37.17]Yeah, I know the age.
[99:39.07]I know the rating it has.
[99:40.51]Now I'm just fucking tilted.
[99:55.39]I'm just fluttering.
[99:56.09]I don't want to be doing this.
[99:58.90]Okay, we start over.
[100:03.26]Where's the part where I could like sprint wicked fast for a few minutes?
[100:07.26]You know what I mean?
[100:07.80]Like, where's that part?
[100:12.26]I had it.
[100:12.82]I know.
[100:13.16]I just don't care.
[100:14.02]I just want to flip this.
[101:01.81]Fuck outta here.
[101:13.74]Now you're stuck here.
[101:14.98]Now you're stuck here.
[101:16.60]Now I can bring everything down safely.
[101:23.17]Right?
[101:24.55]Yes.
[101:34.03]Okay.
[101:38.90]Now I can go down.
[101:40.08]We're good.
[101:45.60]Now, this is where I screw it up.
[101:49.90]If I go down here, he can't go left, but he can go that way.
[101:54.49]So, let me think about this.
[101:57.99]If I go down, he's going here, which means this one has to be here.
[102:04.28]Right?
[102:04.82]I'm just planning this out.
[102:07.73]So if he goes here, then this one needs to be moved as well.
[102:14.09]We don't want to give him any opportunity.
[102:17.81]This means he cannot go diagonal from here.
[102:23.29]So if I go down with this one, he can jump it.
[102:26.71]If I go down with this one right now, he cannot.
[102:29.59]Save it right now.
[102:34.42]Oh, nice.
[102:36.99]So let's see what happens.
[102:39.73]Okay.
[102:46.62]I'm scared.
[103:38.98]No!
[103:39.26]I saw it the last second!
[103:40.72]I hate these fucking games!
[103:46.19]No!
[103:46.57]It doesn't let you cheat!
[103:47.73]It doesn't let you cheat!
[103:48.63]It doesn't let you cheat!
[103:49.57]Oh my god, why did I... It's one little mistake just fucks the whole thing up.
[103:54.58]I hate this.
[103:56.12]I don't want to do this.
[104:11.13]What happened?
[104:11.59]What went so wrong there?
[104:13.03]God damn it.
[104:15.67]Oh, fuck you.
[104:16.83]I would never bring this to Friday Night Game Night.
[104:22.29]Ever.
[104:55.37]Where you going?
[104:55.69]Why are you doing that?
[104:56.23]Why are you doing that?
[104:57.70]Why are you doing that?
[104:59.15]Why are you doing that?
[105:00.87]Why is he doing that?
[105:24.55]He can't go this way, right?
[105:27.64]Can he go this way?
[105:29.72]He cannot go this way.
[105:30.92]Can he?
[105:32.13]No.
[105:32.43]No, no, no.
[105:32.73]Okay.
[105:32.89]Okay.
[105:46.51]Oh my god, I can't.
[105:48.09]Oh my god, I can't do it.
[105:53.58]I don't think I can do it, guys.
[105:55.60]I don't think I can fucking do it.
[105:57.50]I think I have to literally get a save file from some fucking random ass website.
[106:09.55]I fucking hate this more than anything.
[106:11.17]I fucking hate this shit.
[106:12.39]Okay, we start over.
[106:13.41]I hate this shit.
[106:14.91]I can't play these.
[106:16.67]I can't- I just don't have the- I just don't have the- I could do it, and I'm gonna shut the f- the heck up.
[106:22.41]And I'm gonna beat it.
[106:23.27]Right now.
[106:24.09]Start the timer.
[106:25.18]We're not sitting here anymore, I promise.
[106:27.08]All of you that are sitting there, that are thinking, I can't believe this guy, uh, I can't believe this guy, uh, drives a car.
[106:34.64]Don't- I- I got you.
[106:36.18]Just relax.
[106:40.35]What does this have to do with driving a car anyways?
[106:41.93]It's not like you do this when you stop at a stop sign.
[107:12.81]Can't do anything.
[107:14.03]He's stuck.
[107:16.17]I can move this here and it's safe.
[107:20.03]No, I can't do that.
[107:20.91]Okay.
[107:24.81]Wait a minute.
[107:25.24]What if I put him up here?
[107:27.94]No.
[107:28.56]Should I put him up there?
[107:29.22]Worst gamer moment?
[107:31.84]These things are annoying and hard.
[107:33.26]I guarantee you, you sit 90% of you down.
[107:38.44]You ain't going to beat this in five minutes.
[107:59.24]What should I move?
[108:00.22]I just... I'm so paranoid that I'm gonna just miss something.
[108:03.37]No wonder the other guy got up.
[108:06.85]Because you were kicking his ass for three straight days in a lodge, and that's all you guys can do is just sit here?
[108:15.37]Oh my god, I... See, I can't even see it.
[108:17.43]I can't... I can't even... It's... I can't even comprehend it.
[108:21.69]My brain is not wired to be able to understand how this game works in every single facet of it.
[108:27.47]This is like the one, if a bomb was going to go off, get me out of this room.
[108:31.53]Don't give this to me.
[108:32.79]It's not going to happen.
[108:50.91]Oh my God.
[108:51.95]Damn it.
[108:52.97]I fucking want to get out of here.
[108:54.47]So bad.
[108:55.07]We start over.
[108:59.83]It's not hard.
[109:00.53]It's just there are so many places to screw it up.
[109:04.06]Alright.
[109:04.62]I'm going to get it this time.
[109:05.60]Alright.
[109:06.37]Trust me.
[109:46.53]That's safe.
[109:47.13]Everything is safe if I do it here.
[109:48.36]There's nothing you can jump over here.
[109:53.70]So I can start closing the gap here.
[109:58.43]As long as I move this and then the other one right behind it.
[110:02.51]Immediately.
[110:11.42]Okay, you're stuck here.
[110:13.56]Same deal.
[110:14.98]Wait, I gotta be aware of this.
[110:16.58]So... Move... What should I... I don't know what to do first.
[110:27.97]Putting this here is free.
[110:30.63]It would ruin everything.
[110:31.51]So moving this, we'd have to see what he moves.
[110:34.43]I put this here.
[110:35.23]And he moves diagonal.
[110:37.87]I don't know.
[110:39.05]Maybe I should move one of these down.
[110:42.43]This one down.
[110:43.01]Because then he has to go up.
[110:47.56]And then from here... You've got nothing.
[110:51.32]You've got nothing.
[110:53.68]It's like you've got nothing.
[110:56.38]So I can safely move this here.
[110:58.64]Or this forward.
[111:01.26]You've got nothing.
[111:07.39]Okay, you've got nothing.
[111:10.71]This is coming down.
[111:15.95]You've got nothing.
[111:18.43]This is coming down.
[111:21.13]You got nothing.
[111:22.11]You've got nothing here.
[111:34.80]There's no diagonal to here.
[111:36.72]So I can move this, you'll come down, and you got nothing.
[111:40.24]By the way.
[111:47.37]You've got nothing.
[111:48.47]Alright.
[111:51.99]Now we come down with it, right?
[111:55.55]Come down with this one.
[111:59.23]Down with this one.
[112:00.81]You've got no, you can't, you literally can't go anywhere.
[112:02.55]So just bring these ones down where I can.
[112:06.37]Alright.
[112:06.67]Now what?
[112:09.07]Now what?
[112:16.41]Should I try to do what I did before and just keep them down here?
[112:19.46]Is that the right play?
[112:23.30]Keeping them down here.
[112:24.24]Is that the right play?
[112:30.00]Alright.
[112:31.06]We're solid right now.
[112:33.86]Actually has nowhere to go.
[112:35.16]Now, I don't want to mess this up.
[112:36.64]And I'm going to if I don't.
[112:38.26]I'm going to mess this up big time.
[112:40.70]If I put this one down, then it's bad.
[112:50.31]This one comes down, it's over.
[112:51.99]This one comes down, it's not over.
[112:53.83]If I put the middle one down.
[112:58.55]If I put this down and he goes to the diagonal, I'm in trouble, aren't I?
[113:05.81]I could have one move to bring the one down, which should save me, right?
[113:14.20]Middle coming down blocks everything he's doing.
[113:24.02]Now, he can go, he can only go this way, so I can block that here.
[113:28.12]Wait a minute, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[113:33.84]I block that, he has to go back down, so he ends up here, and I have these two.
[113:39.17]So you end up right here with two here.
[113:42.51]He can't, if I go down, then he'll go that way, and I have to bring another one down.
[113:55.48]Okay, this one or the middle one?
[113:58.84]I'm not sure because I think it's both scary.
[114:02.42]Or do I bring this down again?
[114:03.99]But that will, I think, open up too many opportunities.
[114:08.73]I think I'm bringing the right one down.
[114:13.85]Okay.
[114:14.83]Then I'm bringing this one down.
[114:16.41]That blocks them.
[114:20.31]So he can go right.
[114:21.37]He's gonna go right.
[114:22.21]I'll block that.
[114:23.01]He's gonna go right again.
[114:24.09]I don't... I can't block it again.
[114:26.87]What the... What... What... Hey!
[114:28.43]What happened?
[114:29.17]What... What... Huh?
[114:30.58]Huh?
[114:30.90]Huh?
[114:31.28]Excuse me.
[114:31.70]What's going on?
[114:32.28]What just happened?
[114:32.74]Why did it move?
[114:35.72]What just happened?
[114:40.70]Okay, we're fine.
[114:42.45]He went up.
[114:46.55]Bring middle down.
[114:50.67]Or do I bring this one down?
[114:52.33]If I bring this down here, then he has to go right.
[115:00.86]This is, I think this is correct.
[115:06.38]So many people don't know.
[115:07.28]I don't want to mess this up, I swear.
[115:12.53]This one going down?
[115:13.59]Or this one come down?
[115:21.56]Bro, he's stupid.
[115:23.76]I just don't want to mess it up.
[115:25.84]I just don't want to screw it up.
[115:30.81]The top one.
[115:33.43]This one comes down.
[115:34.39]That's what I was thinking.
[115:36.07]That's correct, right?
[115:40.22]Yes.
[115:41.60]That's what I would have done.
[115:43.64]Alright, now.
[115:45.68]I can't come down.
[115:46.40]I can't come down.
[115:47.68]We just have to start moving other stuff down.
[115:51.22]If I move anything, it's over.
[115:55.51]This has to come down?
[115:57.41]He's trapped here.
[115:58.01]He can't do anything.
[116:05.11]This comes down?
[116:25.43]I'm safe as long as I was going to get everything in the right spot.
[116:27.75]If even it comes up here, I can't.
[116:28.99]Alright.
[116:29.35]Bring everything down.
[116:30.13]Okay.
[116:40.29]Alright.
[116:40.59]Alright.
[116:40.89]Alright.
[116:41.83]Now this comes down.
[116:44.38]If he moves to the right, then I block it.
[116:48.48]Right?
[116:51.82]Blocked.
[116:55.56]Blocked.
[116:58.28]Blocked.
[117:00.46]Wait.
[117:03.61]He's going to move down.
[117:05.81]If I move this, then he'll be able to get that.
[117:08.25]Blocked.
[117:17.15]Blocked.
[117:21.86]Blocked.
[117:29.59]Blocked.
[117:33.63]Okay.
[117:34.07]Blocked.
[117:34.80]Now.
[117:35.12]I got him.
[117:38.78]V for victory.
[117:42.68]What just happened?
[117:43.12]Did I lose?
[117:50.61]Did I win?
[117:59.46]Did it take too long?
[118:01.90]He fell asleep.
[118:06.02]People who sleep during the day usually have a hard time sleeping at night, you know.
[118:10.03]It was optional.
[118:12.15]You have to win this three times.
[118:14.73]No, I don't.
[118:22.05]How about another game?
[118:22.93]No.
[118:24.12]I've kept you awake long enough.
[118:25.96]Anytime you want to talk, just wake me up.
[118:27.90]It's three games.
[118:29.24]No, it's not.
[118:30.08]I don't remember any of that.
[118:31.00]I would just watch the VOD.
[118:33.40]It's just a side game.
[118:35.34]No, it's definitely not seven times.
[118:39.34]It's just optional.
[118:40.24]Well, I thought he was going to give me an item or something.
[118:41.80]Alright.
[118:42.12]Well, now what the hell am I doing now?
[118:46.16]Huh?
[118:46.87]Oh, now what?
[118:48.63]Well, sorry to bother you.
[118:50.29]You want to talk?
[118:51.33]You know where to find me.
[118:58.68]Whatever.
[119:00.42]Well, okay.
[119:01.39]Fine.
[119:06.21]Now what?

[119:19.04]This is a fun game.
[119:19.58]Hope everyone's having a good time.
[119:22.96]I'm having a good time.
[119:29.15]I need to cook.
[119:34.41]Where's the door?
[119:34.85]I have no object permanence.
[119:39.83]Again?
[119:40.06]I'm never here.
[119:42.64]I'm never here to cook food.
[119:54.55]Oh God, this is elaborate.

[120:05.71]Salmon and or a salad.
[120:07.44]Cook salmon on the griddle and remove when it turns bright orange-pink.
[120:12.00]Put extra salad ingredients in the salad bowl on top of the lettuce.
[120:17.46]All salads are to be topped with the lodge's famous icicle creek ranch dressing.
[120:23.48]What if somebody doesn't want ranch dressing?
[120:24.92]We just put it on everything.
[120:30.45]Why would I put... What if somebody says, don't put any sauce on it?
[120:32.79]Do I say, I don't care.
[120:33.73]That's how it comes.

[127:16.92]Right?
[127:21.79]People in their rooms or anything?
[127:23.19]No.

[127:38.21]Um, yeah.
[127:39.93]Holy.
[127:41.43]Anymore?
[127:41.71]Now what?
[127:52.19]Why am I stuck here?
[127:56.63]What's going on?
[127:57.43]What do you want?
[127:59.07]You messed with my rifle, didn't you?
[128:01.50]This I gotta hear.
[128:02.88]What?
[128:03.14]Excuse me?
[128:04.66]This fax just came for you.
[128:06.32]It's from the wacko left wing wildlife gang that paid you to screw up my rifle so I'd miss that wolf.
[128:12.32]How dare you talk to me like that?
[128:14.46]I'm leaving this place right now.
[128:16.42]Good.
[128:17.29]You just got yourself an escort off the premises.
[128:28.51]What happened?
[128:30.07]Hey, wait, wait!
[128:30.63]No, I'm the detective!
[128:32.73]Come talk to me!

[128:43.50]What?

[128:51.83]Please call me.
[128:52.57]When it comes to the White Wolf, there is much for us to talk about.
[128:57.79]Alright, let's... Did I call you on a secure line?

[133:12.07]It's too cold.
[133:13.09]Call in the morning maybe?
[133:14.31]Can I just go to bed?
[133:15.61]I feel like there's not much else I can do right now.
[133:22.35]Call 1555 Mystico and prepare to be amazed.
[133:29.57]There's not even enough numbers on a keypad to type that in.
[133:35.53]Whoever came up with that jingle.
[133:36.47]What are you talking about?
[133:42.67]Go call it?
[133:43.27]There's not even that many numbers.
[133:48.29]That doesn't make any sense.
[133:51.25]What was it?
[133:52.55]Mystico? 155.
[134:00.32]1-5-5-5-1-5-5-1-5-5-5 call Mystico.
[134:02.18]What is it?
[134:02.90]1-5-5-5-M-Y-S-T-I-C-O?
[134:03.98]Who dares disturb the concentration of Mystico the Magnificent?
[134:27.78]Um, I'm sorry.
[134:28.90]This is Nancy Drew.
[134:30.42]Nancy Drew.
[134:32.45]I see your future clear as tape.
[134:35.93]I see... That's too many numbers.
[134:38.43]And a dark figure named Bruno.
[134:42.27]Bruno.
[134:42.69]Bruno?
[134:43.53]But beware, Nancy Drew.
[134:45.39]The wolf will only lead to danger and intrigue.
[134:50.37]Cool.
[134:51.00]I mean, yes, Mystico.
[134:53.58]The Magnificent.
[134:55.25]Huh?
[134:55.95]You're supposed to say Mystico the Magnificent.
[134:59.25]Oh, right.
[135:00.33]Yes, Mystico the Magnificent.
[135:03.19]So, Nancy Drew, what secrets from the beyond do you seek?
[135:09.65]A hint.
[135:11.27]What do you think I am?
[135:12.31]An insurance salesman?
[135:13.80]A pair of underage detectives?
[135:15.96]A star-struck teenager?
[135:17.52]A washed-up police officer?
[135:19.54]An elderly housekeeper?
[135:21.44]A parrot?
[135:23.25]You have incurred the wrath of Mystico.
[135:27.11]From this moment forward, bad luck shall creep behind you like a malevolent shadow.
[135:33.33]Don't say that.
[135:34.45]Mystico has spoken.
[135:36.24]Now, why would you say that to me?
[135:39.06]What the heck?
[135:46.82]Don't do that.
[135:51.07]People said...
[135:57.87]I'm just gonna go to bed.
[136:06.79]Isn't this my room?
[136:09.11]This is my room.
[136:09.81]Is this my room?
[136:14.45]Where's my room?
[136:21.58]Is this my room?
[136:23.26]Which one of these is mine?
[136:45.39]Isn't it this one?
[136:46.01]It's the one that's locked.
[136:57.36]You should put your facecam on, we'll tell you.
[136:58.74]Mmm.
[137:02.40]You would like me to turn my facecam on, wouldn't you?
[137:07.48]Check my items.
[137:11.03]Okay, I need to call... Okay, I'm gonna call her in the morning.
[137:14.99]Is this thing... I haven't seen... Have you seen any of these?
[137:19.33]I haven't... I don't know what that's trying to tell me.
[137:22.87]Is the people that stay... What is this?
[137:25.31]Oh, that's the fishing toolbox.
[137:26.80]We already did that.
[137:27.48]Here's the bullet.
[137:28.36]We already called this.
[137:36.00]This is the book of things going on.
[137:38.57]I don't know.
[137:56.53]What about... What about her room?
[137:59.35]I'm going up to her room.
[138:00.33]Because... Okay, she just got, like, kicked out, right?
[138:08.08]Maybe she left something behind?
[138:09.04]I don't know.
[138:09.52]What was it again?
[138:14.40]Oh, lolly.
[138:14.96]Did he leave something behind?
[138:35.82]Nothing?
[138:38.23]No.
[138:38.35]Alright.
[138:45.21]Huh.
[138:46.63]I mean, it's 7.30 at night.
[138:47.71]It's getting kind of late.
[138:53.92]I can't leave.
[138:55.06]So there's got to be something I can do here.
[138:59.28]This is weird, too.
[139:00.40]What is this?
[139:01.52]Why does it want me to look at this?
[139:04.00]7.30 isn't late?
[139:05.66]Well, it's late enough where I can't leave the lodge.
[139:08.32]I need to get the snowshoes.
[139:18.97]How do I get the snowshoes from him?
[139:30.62]I don't get it.
[139:31.04]We can talk to this guy again.
[139:39.63]Nope.
[139:40.75]You have no other dialog?
[139:41.69]No.
[139:42.05]What about the sauna?
[139:43.05]The sauna's just hanging out here.
[139:44.61]Is there anything I can do with the sauna?
[139:46.13]I don't know.
[140:00.92]Right?
[140:01.12]Like, what's this for?
[140:03.84]Anything good?
[140:13.99]I don't know.
[140:20.01]Do Lala or it's Lala or pre-recorded.
[140:24.89]That's the worst way to get me to do that.
[140:29.47]Save the game.
[140:40.15]This is the first game that I ever played.
[140:41.69]It's a good one, so.
[140:56.42]I can't leave.
[140:57.50]So I have to call that number.
[140:58.74]She's just not available.
[141:12.40]Go to bed?
[141:12.88]I can't.
[141:14.20]I can't go to sleep.
[141:19.58]One, three.
[141:21.67]This is Lupe.
[141:30.99]Leave a message and perhaps we'll talk later.
[141:32.93]Still not there.
[141:34.97]Toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat, toy boat.
[141:38.41]Oh, rough.
[141:40.33]It's close though.
[142:01.23]I do.
[142:01.49]Are these symbols in the- wait a minute.
[142:10.94]What about that device that's sitting on the table?
[142:14.44]Where is it?
[142:16.08]With the wolf face and then this thing.
[142:18.72]Have I not figured out what the hell this means yet?
[142:20.53]I have to know what this is- what is going on here, right?
[142:23.99]I have to know what this means.
[142:25.67]What is this?
[142:30.90]You know what I'm saying?
[142:48.88]There's nothing under the table.
[142:51.96]What about that symbol note?
[142:53.66]Yeah, but what?
[142:58.81]Okay, is there... I don't know.
[143:03.24]Do the animals have symbols next to them somewhere?
[143:05.50]I think it means... I'm not reading that.
[143:27.51]It's the saga of the white wolf.
[143:29.54]Don't forget.
[143:31.78]Yeah, I know.
[143:33.16]So what?
[143:35.18]What does that mean?
[143:37.74]What does that mean?
[143:38.42]Why are you saying that?
[143:39.56]Why are you putting that in quotes?
[143:42.67]Don't forget.
[143:43.43]It's the saga of the white wolf.
[143:45.23]Why are you saying that?
[143:53.31]What's that?
[143:53.69]Is that a book?
[143:57.52]Is that a book up here?
[143:58.16]Where are the books?
[144:15.25]How do I go to sleep?
[144:27.96]Skip.
[144:28.28]I'm trying to spin in circles.
[144:29.66]Go that way.
[144:34.63]Who had that book?
[144:36.83]Where's the book?
[144:46.65]Saga of the Winter Sports Monthly.
[145:09.39]call of the wild that's not it I thought this is gonna be it where is it it's the saga of the white wolf damn it I don't know where to go
[145:37.10]Engineering, geology, machines... Wait, what was that crumpled up piece of paper?
[145:48.93]It's all totally unfair and I'm sick of putting up with things that aren't fair.
[145:52.78]It's his fault, her fault, their fault, but I don't have what's rightfully mine.
[145:57.52]They are thieves.
[145:59.04]And it's an insult to have what they stole from us waved around in my face.
[146:03.50]I could throttle them.
[146:05.28]Both of them for what they did.
[146:07.57]Justice shall be served one day.
[146:09.19]One day I will have justice.
[146:11.83]Whose room is this?
[146:19.50]Is it the fish one?
[146:21.04]Pish Pish is who?
[146:28.56]Bill Kessler.
[146:32.39]Okay, Bill, that's your room.
[146:37.19]Snowshoes on the ground?
[146:41.64]Are those snowshoes?
[146:45.86]I don't think I can look down and get them.
[146:52.69]No.
[146:54.08]Oh, those are slippers, dude.
[146:57.40]Get out there in slippers.
[147:01.66]God damn it.
[147:03.16]What?
[147:03.48]Where am I going?
[147:04.80]Okay, I need to fucking focus for one goddamn second.
[147:10.54]The same shit happens to me in Myst when it's just pictures instead of like actually moving.
[147:13.92]My brain does not let me put it into memory.
[147:21.31]This is Bill's room.
[147:22.43]No, this is my room.
[147:31.96]Whose fucking room is this?
[147:34.78]Where are the snowshoes?
[147:42.01]Get them!
[147:44.05]I can't pick them up.
[147:52.27]I can't touch them.
[148:01.42]No stealing.
[148:09.15]I've been walking around in a simulated hour.
[148:26.51]Please lala into your microphone.
[148:32.91]Did you check the den?
[148:38.85]What the fuck is this?
[148:41.41]What are these?
[148:45.34]Snowshoes.
[148:46.70]I thought these were tennis rackets.
[148:55.38]Wait a minute.
[149:01.19]Do I have something here?
[149:02.49]What's this?
[149:12.29]How do I get that?
[149:21.95]Heat and moisture sometimes cause the door of the sauna to stick.
[149:24.95]Periodically check to make sure that no guests are inside.
[149:27.31]What?
[149:28.85]That sounds pretty bad.
[149:51.14]Wait a minute.
[149:54.68]Wait a minute.
[149:59.90]Wait a minute.
[150:01.94]Guys.
[150:04.08]She was full of shit.
[150:07.28]There are no eagles in the winter.
[150:08.68]There are no orioles in the winter.
[150:10.48]She's a liar.
[150:12.31]Not watching birds at all.
[150:24.48]There's booze in that.
[150:25.26]Interesting.
[150:32.71]Don't we already know that she wasn't birdwatching?
[150:34.89]She told us.
[150:38.67]Interesting.
[150:40.21]That's right.
[150:41.07]Good detectives always stick together.
[150:43.61]By the tens of thousands.
[150:46.83]So, you know, I'll work on a case with you to get there.
[150:56.24]Imagine being a detective and having a fucking Twitch chat.
[151:00.86]Oh my god.
[151:03.73]What a fucking nightmare.
[151:04.85]Alright, I need to figure out how to get these.
[151:14.56]It's a four-digit code.
[151:15.96]What's the code?
[151:16.88]Like, is it a number?
[151:17.62]It's numbers.
[151:21.92]Okay.
[151:22.04]Okay.
[151:23.81]You know, I've seen this number in the chat.
[151:28.37]Drew Crew spam this so he opens it.
[151:31.31]But this is cheating.
[151:35.49]The Drew Crew wants me to hurry up and finish this.
[151:40.24]I mean, I can't pretend like I haven't seen the number like a thousand times.
[151:49.16]Everybody's writing this.
[151:56.11]It's four... It's... Oh, now they're fucking it all up.
[152:02.47]Okay.
[152:08.08]Drew Crew, spam this so he sees.
[152:10.12]It's not even real.
[152:12.72]I'm gonna get it on my own, okay?
[152:14.88]And by on my own, I mean I want you to help me get there.
[152:21.13]I'm gonna ask you a bunch of questions.
[152:23.59]And I would like for you to answer them.
[152:26.32]I'm the detective.
[152:27.46]I'm asking you.
[152:33.30]It's time for your questioning.
[152:42.25]You ever get bad dog breath?
[152:43.97]I feel like that sometimes.
[152:44.83]Go check on somebody, dude.
[152:50.48]I think their balls are stuck to the sauna bottom.
[152:56.30]I think we're okay, man.
[152:57.80]Nice talking to you.
[152:58.68]Been real.
[153:01.04]What's up?
[153:02.40]Nice talking to you.
[153:03.61]Ditto, dude.
[153:09.99]It's something with this, right?
[153:11.61]But I don't know.
[153:12.89]I need the snowshoes.
[153:16.00]I gotta figure out what that... Because this is telling me what the code is.
[153:19.80]But where are their numbers?
[153:24.43]Are there numbers somewhere with symbols next to them?
[153:28.29]Because I don't know what this would be next to.
[153:37.02]The numbers are on the note.
[153:40.24]This is not... These are symbols.
[154:03.81]It's mirrored.
[154:11.59]What are you talking about?
[154:15.21]Is this a four?
[154:16.87]A one?
[154:17.33]An eight?
[154:22.45]A nine?
[154:24.59]What do you mean?
[154:26.91]It's mirrored.
[154:27.79]What?

[155:14.34]I- I forgot this game was made-

[155:18.66]Well, not... Adults, too, can enjoy these.
[155:20.51]It's for everybody.
[155:35.33]What was it?
[155:35.74]Seven... One... Seven, nine... What is it?
[155:40.83]What is it?
[155:41.15]7, 9, 8?
[155:43.86]7, 9, 1, 4.
[155:46.30]That's not correct.
[155:49.24]That's incorrect.
[155:50.58]That's incorrect!
[155:57.20]You guys don't have it right!
[155:58.38]7, 9, 1, 4 is incorrect!
[155:59.62]7, 9, 1, 4.
[155:59.84]Is it 4, 1, 9, 7?
[156:22.65]What's happening right now, because I don't think this is right.
[156:24.55]You guys are all wrong.
[156:25.49]4-1- Write it correctly!
[156:38.60]4-1- That's not correct!
[156:46.90]You guys got it wrong!

[157:25.04]So what's going on here?
[157:32.20]Is it like an accept button?
[157:43.19]Press enter.
[157:44.79]No.
[157:46.55]That's for something else then.
[157:49.35]Well, shit.
[157:49.79]Shit.
[157:57.52]That might be part of the suitcase.
[157:59.73]Maybe it's backwards.
[158:05.59]Yeah, I'll put it in.
[158:06.37]I just did it backwards too.
[158:07.21]Maybe a year?
[158:11.76]Like 19... 1947?
[158:11.90]Would it be a year?
[158:12.50]I don't know.
[158:12.82]I don't...
[158:26.91]No, no, it's definitely, that's for something else.
[158:32.28]Read the plaque.
[158:34.22]Snowshoes owned and used by Trapper Dan in the early 1900s.
[158:37.10]Right.
[158:37.46]That didn't work.
[158:40.18]What about 1974?
[158:40.46]No.
[159:01.68]What about seven s- hold on.
[159:05.41]Seven... six?
[159:08.13]No, that's not gonna be a six.
[159:09.54]That's nine.
[159:12.76]Oh wait!
[159:13.16]I'm gonna call, uh, the number.
[159:31.29]This is Lupe.
[159:31.87]Leave a message and perhaps we'll talk later.
[159:33.81]Still not there.
[159:35.45]It's a six.
[159:36.03]Oh my God, I'm dying.
[159:37.35]You think it's a six?
[159:47.86]So it would be seven, seven, six, one, four.
[160:04.71]Time that person out for one second.
[160:05.81]Look at the wall.
[160:15.39]Oh my god.
[160:16.23]Hold on.
[160:16.67]Trap.
[160:20.05]Trapper Dan started construction of what is known today as the Ice Creek in 1894.
[160:24.19]It served as his center of operations until the winter of 1921.
[160:30.08]When he vanished without a trace in 1934, the lodge was purchased by Abe Wentworth, who maintained it as a hunting lodge until 1894.
[160:49.01]1934.
[160:49.03]Let's just write 19... 19... 19... 1934?
[160:49.59]19... 1930... I don't know. 1980...
[161:48.94]You're wrong, all of you.
[161:49.92]All of you are wrong.
[161:50.60]7669?
[161:50.62]You're wrong too!
[162:38.12]At some point, who's coming over here and going, Nancy, what are you doing over there?
[162:50.51]Call the number?
[162:51.43]I just did.
[162:54.95]You have to call Tino.
[163:08.75]Tino, you awake?
[163:11.01]I need help.
[163:22.12]Thanks, Tino.
[163:28.88]Can't I just be like, what's the code for the snowshoes?
[163:31.04]Because I need them.
[163:32.70]Why is this so difficult?
[163:34.40]Can somebody get me snowshoes?
[163:37.10]Hi Chantal, it's Nancy Drew.
[163:38.80]You know who's behind the accidents?
[163:41.28]Not quite yet.
[163:42.66]Oh.
[163:54.48]This is a lot of questions.
[164:00.48]How come the entries for last year were deleted from the guest register?
[164:05.49]That's what the computer says.
[164:07.05]Contents deleted.
[164:08.43]Well, I didn't delete them.
[164:09.81]Freddy.
[164:11.84]Okay.
[164:16.54]Ollie's daughter?
[164:17.78]Has she done other things like that?
[164:19.70]No, but you know how kids are these days.
[164:23.36]Always hacking into computers, programming them to spread viruses and steal passwords and blow up the world.
[164:29.88]I think that's only in movies.
[164:31.44]Besides, pretty much all this person had to do was press the delete key.
[164:35.97]I'd like to know more about the accidents.
[164:37.65]I asked Ollie, but he said you said he wasn't allowed to talk about them Okay
[165:05.69]I'm not listening.
[165:06.25]I'm not paying any attention, by the way.
[165:34.38]poor Elsa was cleaning for days.
[165:38.10]And the odor, oh my gosh.
[165:42.84]Anyway, then Carl Jenkins slipped on the stairs outside and broke his leg.
[165:47.87]Then Lou Talbot's window was broken.
[165:49.99]Then Elsa the maid's tires were slashed.
[165:52.25]Then the phone wires were cut.
[165:53.79]And then, oh yeah, and then the southweights were almost overcome by fumes when gas started
[166:00.82]the only incidents that you can be sure were sabotage were the tires the phone wires and maybe the explosion in the bunkhouse you're gonna send this I gotta see the survey where's the survey that's why you're there to sort everything out before something else happens I better get back to work I have to get going too bye no I had to go no I had to go don't don't one-up me don't one-up me during our conversation
[166:27.20]Hey, I'm wicked busy, got a lot of stuff going on, I'm outta here.
[166:29.56]Oh, I'm actually wicked busy too!
[166:30.70]Yeah, I was gonna- I was just about to leave.
[166:32.40]No, I was.
[166:33.20]You weren't.
[166:33.98]I was about to leave.
[166:34.58]Okay.
[166:44.43]How do I fill up this survey?
[166:45.35]Is it on the computer or something?
[166:49.77]Like, where's this survey?
[166:59.16]In your inventory.
[167:00.16]No, it's not.
[167:18.83]What kind of weird social... I'm just kidding.
[167:26.77]I don't actually think that.
[167:28.79]Or does he?
[167:29.07]Alright.
[167:33.58]So I don't have this thing you're talking about.
[167:35.44]Let's see.
[167:49.37]Get the guest survey.
[167:55.07]When I just talked...
[168:03.53]Give me the survey.
[168:09.23]Hello?
[168:09.95]Hi, it's Nancy Drew.
[168:11.53]Did you ask Yanni about using his picture yet?
[168:14.11]Yes, but he said no.
[168:16.20]Darn.
[168:17.24]Well, thanks for trying.
[168:18.78]I can't... There's no... I just talked... There's no guest... The guests that are in the lodge now, did any of them stay here last year?
[168:26.46]Let's see.
[168:27.74]Lou Talbot stayed here last summer, but only very briefly.
[168:30.96]His car had broken down and he...
[168:34.10]About Tino, I'm not totally comfortable with the idea of consulting with him on this case.
[168:37.37]Okay.
[169:00.11]Okay, but... Okay, but... Anything else?
[169:01.01]No.
[169:01.09]Okay.
[169:34.01]Go outside?
[169:34.59]I can't.
[169:35.57]It won't let me.
[169:36.17]It's too cold.
[169:37.31]Apparently.
[169:38.73]Why do I have the laundry bag at 10 o'clock at night?
[169:42.96]Who told me to pick this up?
[169:43.96]I can't do anything.
[170:13.31]Go to bed?
[170:13.83]I don't think I can go to bed.
[170:17.95]I'm just trapped.
[170:20.39]I can?
[170:20.83]I was in my room and I couldn't click on my bed.
[170:25.88]Get me the hell out of here.
[170:33.28]Which my room again?
[170:38.34]I better wait until this do not disturb sign is gone.
[170:41.02]I better wait until this do not disturb sign is gone.
[170:43.68]Where's my room?
[170:48.89]This is my bedroom?
[171:02.39]What just hit me in the head?
[171:06.07]Why is it I woke up at 1 o'clock in the morning?
[171:08.69]Now it's 1 p.m.
[171:17.47]I missed serving breakfast.
[171:20.29]Oh, God.
[171:20.99]Just hold on.
[171:26.48]True, though.
[171:27.16]How often does that happen?
[171:28.34]All the time.
[171:30.38]I gotta go to food.
[171:31.76]As long as it's not time to cook, I might as well stay out of the kitchen.
[171:37.51]Alright, now I can finally leave.
[171:39.11]I'm gonna call that number.
[171:41.67]What was it?
[171:44.53]213... 326... I've memorized it by this point.
[171:49.66]Hello?
[171:57.22]Miss Camillo?
[171:58.12]Hi, it's Nancy Drew from Icicle Creek Lodge.
[172:01.12]Yes, of course.
[172:02.58]Is the wolf alright?
[172:03.99]Hmm...
[172:35.33]It scares me.
[172:37.89]The wolf scares me.
[172:47.34]When I was trapped out on the lake without a coat, it dragged one to the shore and left it there for me.
[172:52.64]It may have sensed you were in trouble, or its behavior may have been totally random.
[172:57.28]But either way, the fact that the wolf didn't simply run away from you is very bad news.
[173:02.24]It is?
[173:03.35]Wolves and humans simply do not mix.
[173:06.31]While wolves may appear to be similar to dogs, behaviors that have been bred out of dogs after thousands of years of domestication are still instinctive to wolves.
[173:16.32]Training a wolf to behave like a dog may mask those instincts, but it cannot eradicate them.
[173:21.98]For that reason, no matter how sociable the wolf may appear, instinct can at any moment rear its ugly head with devastating results for any humans involved and for the wolf.
[173:32.92]Especially for the wolf, who will have simply been doing what comes naturally.
[173:36.60]Don't go up to wild animals like it's a Disney movie.
[173:42.96]I think we could all agree on that.
[173:52.08]So the fact that this wolf doesn't seem to be that afraid of people could lead people to think they don't have to be afraid of it.
[173:58.76]Precisely.
[173:59.98]It could make them forget that all wolves are, first and foremost, wild.
[174:04.93]He's so brave.
[174:06.59]Do not ever, ever give in to the temptation to feed the wolf.
[174:10.59]For one thing, a wolf's jaws are twice as powerful as a Jerma shepherd's.
[174:15.21]And should your hand happen to get in its way when it tries to feed...
[174:18.76]I get the picture.
[174:19.56]For another thing, making the wolf dependent upon you for food would seal its doom.
[174:24.63]I was talking about throwing raw turkeys to it, right?
[174:27.03]That's my bad.
[174:27.41]But the very best thing you can do for that wolf is nothing.
[174:32.51]Yeah, I was talking about giving it raw turkeys and stuff, right?
[174:35.72]I was like, oh, just throw raw turkey at it.
[174:37.54]Yeah, that's a good idea, Jeremy.
[174:40.52]Bad idea.
[174:43.17]Are you the one who wrecked all the gear that was in the fishing shack?
[174:46.48]Yes, that was me.
[174:47.50]I was afraid that Bill Kessler fellow would encounter the wolf on one of his trips out to the shack and that it would end badly for the wolf.
[174:55.68]So I did a number on his equipment.
[174:57.98]I've done worse while working on behalf of Run and Grow Free.
[175:01.80]Believe me.
[175:03.30]Gonna have to bring the stream warning back.
[175:05.40]Oh, yeah.
[175:06.78]Do not attempt anything you see or hear here.
[175:10.33]All this is to be never attempted.
[175:13.47]It's a stream based around comedy.
[175:18.54]And there's some things here that you do not be set again or to be attempted.
[175:22.62]I forgot about that.
[175:24.81]Yeah, I gotta have that like take up the whole entire it's going to be a watermark across the entire image.
[175:36.79]When you were here at the lodge, how come you had a magazine that featured Jan Iwok Staya in your room?
[175:41.71]You're very observant.
[175:43.59]I read the article thinking he might make a good spokesperson for Run and Grow Free.
[175:49.39]But then I actually talked to him.
[175:51.53]At which point I realized that not only is he a raving egomaniac, but he's appallingly superstitious when it comes to wolves.
[175:59.48]I put an abrupt end to that conversation.
[176:01.60]I was afraid he might try to tell me that wolves had eaten his grandmother or something.
[176:06.79]You know, actually, never mind.
[176:12.93]Why didn't you just come out and tell the people at Icicle Creek Lodge that you were there to protect the wolf?
[176:18.18]Because I assumed, and quite correctly as it turns out, that very few people there would be sympathetic to my cause.
[176:25.20]Didn't even ask.
[176:26.03]Had I not been undercover, they may have tried to foil my efforts.
[176:30.11]Instead, I was able to foil theirs.
[176:33.03]For a while, at least.
[176:41.39]You need to get back to work.
[176:42.46]I'm getting back to work.
[176:43.08]Thanks for calling.
[176:44.52]Oh, and from now on, call me Lupe.
[176:48.00]I think you've earned that right.
[176:56.65]We're sorry.
[176:57.43]Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
[176:59.25]Please check the number and dial again.
[177:01.45]This is a recording.
[177:11.14]Now I can take the test, he's saying.
[177:18.15]Hello?
[177:18.87]Hi, it's Nancy Drew.
[177:20.43]I'm glad you called.
[177:21.93]Ollie tells me Guadalupe Camillo checked out.
[177:24.77]Actually, it was more like Ollie threw her out.
[177:27.33]Well, good riddance, right?
[177:29.29]I mean, he said she was an environmental nut job.
[177:32.37]In fact, he said he wouldn't be surprised if she's the one who caused those accidents in
[177:38.51]Hold on.
[177:39.95]Hold on a second.
[177:41.73]We just spoke.
[177:44.31]And... Wait, I can just accuse?
[177:47.25]I can just accuse automatically.
[177:58.54]Now call Tino.
[178:03.60]bad friend yeah we just became really good friends I can now yeah um but don't betray don't betray I don't know I don't think so you don't I was hoping I could tell my lawyers that the case is closed and come home we don't know though I still have to come up with proof oh that well the lodge is probably better off without her in any case although she did pay for her stay in advance and in cash
[178:33.09]Okay, now that's it.
[178:34.19]Now we call Tino.
[178:36.37]Which gets us the survey.
[178:38.11]Never mind.
[178:38.59]Alright, now what the hell do I do?
[179:06.62]What do I do now?
[179:07.20]You have to go back to Avalanche Ridge to trigger her recognizing she needs the shoes.
[179:18.70]Didn't I already do that?
[179:19.56]I already did that.
[179:23.66]Yeah, she was like, oh, I can't go anywhere further without snowshoes and I kept walking and she died.
[179:31.96]Go to Avalanche Creek.
[179:35.12]You died... Avalanche Creek, not Ridge.
[179:48.03]Where's Avalanche Creek?
[180:01.22]Avalanche Ridge.
[180:04.70]Okay, now.
[180:06.74]So deep, I'm sinking.
[180:08.18]Okay.
[180:08.36]Gonna need some snow shoes.
[180:12.55]Turn around.
[180:12.91]I need snow shoes.
[180:13.83]Oh my god, and now I'm gonna die.
[180:35.11]I don't have any more hand warmers.
[180:39.98]No, no, no, no.
[180:44.96]I feel warmer already.
[180:47.02]Alright.
[180:47.32]Now, where do I get the snowshoes?
[180:51.04]You.
[181:00.71]Now call.
[181:10.11]I need snowshoes.
[181:10.85]Where do I get them?
[181:16.39]Hello?
[181:17.13]Hi, it's Nancy.
[181:18.53]Listen, I think I'm onto something, but I desperately need snowshoes.
[181:22.12]Could you give me the combination to the lock on the display case so I can use the ones in there?
[181:26.02]I certainly can, but I'm not going to until you do something for me.
[181:31.44]Sure.
[181:31.66]What do you want me to do?
[181:32.24]I'm going to fax you a survey that Tino came up with.
[181:34.68]I can't believe it.
[181:38.31]at the lodge rather than just asking them the questions outright.
[181:41.96]He says that would put them on their guard.
[181:44.26]When it's all sailed out, fax it to Tino.
[181:46.72]The results will help him come up with a profile that will help you to determine which of our guests is responsible for the accidents.
[181:52.75]I'm just going to write random information.
[181:57.21]Sounds good.
[181:58.03]Excellent.
[181:58.93]I'm faxing it to you even as we speak.
[182:01.21]In fact, it's done.
[182:02.57]So why don't you go get it right
[182:05.51]Which side of the bed does S get up from?
[182:36.71]Yeah, Pluto.
[182:49.53]Okay.
[183:11.58]Didn't answer.
[183:12.16]Actually, I just spilled coffee on this one.
[183:25.37]Neptune.
[183:40.13]Um, yeah.
[183:51.68]This is two states.
[183:53.94]Uh, I don't know.
[183:54.46]The right side?
[183:55.22]What side of the bed?
[183:56.68]Left?
[183:57.00]I don't know.
[183:58.06]And then left?
[184:00.69]Alright, it's filled up.
[184:01.73]Done.
[184:02.89]That was fun.
[184:04.21]Fax it over.
[184:04.71]Turn your machine on.
[184:21.72]Nancy, hi.
[184:22.72]You finished with that survey yet?
[184:24.42]I sure am.
[184:25.36]Good girl.
[184:26.60]I'll just turn on my fax machine here.
[184:37.00]God dammit, I have to go interview people now.
[184:39.72]Speedrun.
[185:20.35]They're not even here.
[185:21.11]Who do I need?
[185:29.82]I need to, okay.
[185:32.60]G, C, L, T, B, K, and Y, V. Let's go talk to, let's go talk to this bill down here, alright?
[185:47.40]Before I forget, Chantal called.
[185:49.54]Told me I can answer any questions you might have about those accidents after all.
[185:54.18]Guess she changed her mind.
[185:55.20]Okay.
[185:55.66]How do you explain what happened to Carl Jenkins, the former guest who slipped on the stairs and broke his leg?
[186:01.30]Can't explain it.
[186:02.54]One minute those stairs were clear and dry.
[186:04.66]Next minute they're slick with ass and he's lying at the bottom of them.
[186:13.33]What's going on with my game?
[186:14.97]Okay.
[186:15.43]You're positive they were clear and dry?
[186:17.81]Yep.
[186:18.51]Chipped every bit of frozen snow off of them.
[186:20.33]Oh, they have the answers in the chat right now.
[186:21.55]Fuck it.
[186:22.19]I don't care.
[186:22.55]Somebody asked those stairs down on purpose because it wasn't nothing I did.
[186:26.30]No, sir.
[186:27.32]No, sir.
[186:28.62]I'll get out of your hair now.
[186:29.76]By the way, you dumped the laundry bag before all the rooms were cleaned, so I put it back up at the front desk.
[186:36.12]He's cheating.
[186:37.29]Yeah, but this mission is literally I just have to talk to people and get their answers.
[186:41.95]We can write it.
[186:42.65]I already know them.
[186:57.55]What is this?
[186:58.59]Do I have to spell the whole thing out?
[187:10.46]It's that, right?
[187:13.84]I don't care.
[187:14.64]I genuinely do not.
[187:16.30]I don't care.
[187:16.88]I know people are saying, oh my god, I can't believe you're cheating right now.
[187:20.50]This is going to take us like an hour.
[187:22.80]This is like a gigantic fetch quest.
[187:24.49]I don't care.
[187:24.81]I'll copy somebody's paper.
[187:31.70]This is the kind of stuff I don't, you know, I don't need to do this detective work.
[187:35.48]We already got detectives here.
[187:37.93]What planet was this one?
[187:40.71]Just search the rooms.
[187:41.97]Just pretend I did.
[187:54.17]Just pretend I did.
[187:57.56]I'm disappointed.
[187:58.44]I'm telling you you're not.
[188:01.93]I know you're not.
[188:03.26]You're not disappointed.
[188:04.26]I know you're not disappointed.
[188:10.48]You cheated not only the game, but yourself.
[188:11.96]I know, that's fine.
[188:13.74]Don't spam that for at least a minute, though, because I can read.
[188:18.15]Why are you even playing this game?
[188:19.49]This is the only time I've done this.
[188:20.95]This is the one time I decided to do this.
[188:31.45]You're letting down the Dru crew?
[188:33.03]The Dru crew... I mean, I'm just saying that we have revitalized the Dru crew the last couple of days.
[188:39.11]There's no way it's disappointing.
[188:40.73]Alright, let me get this right.
[188:44.66]Alright.
[188:46.46]So that is... Earth?
[188:50.20]Wait, what?
[188:53.08]Earth?
[188:59.51]No?
[188:59.71]No?
[189:02.23]Okay.
[189:04.69]Lou is Venus.
[189:14.23]Okay.
[189:22.60]Yes.
[189:23.12]Okay.
[189:26.78]Okay.
[189:28.66]Both.
[189:32.09]Yes.
[189:35.93]How many people is that?
[189:37.29]There's probably people mad at me.
[189:39.01]It's alright.
[189:39.49]Okay.
[189:43.33]Okay.
[189:51.29]No.
[189:51.51]Okay.
[189:57.94]What is this one?
[190:01.42]That?
[190:05.81]I didn't get any of these right even accidentally.
[190:10.69]Hey, look at that.
[190:12.11]I did it.
[190:16.71]Alright.
[190:26.60]Yeah.
[190:30.12]Let's fax that over.
[190:53.19]Turn yours on.
[190:53.75]You messed it up.
[191:00.29]Oh, my God.
[191:01.13]What was wrong with it?
[191:20.41]Oh, wrong plug.
[191:22.83]X?
[191:23.81]Planet X, not Venus.
[191:25.57]So somebody was lying to me in the chat.
[191:29.40]It's Planet X. You understand how painful that would have been?
[191:45.67]All of us know that we want to avoid me opening the same three doors 10 times over the course of 40 minutes, right?
[191:50.31]I mean, I'm just telling you.
[191:52.75]Nancy, you do that survey over?
[191:54.79]Yep.
[191:55.75]Wait a sec.
[191:56.33]Just saving us a little time.
[191:57.51]Machine's on.
[191:58.29]Go for it.
[192:05.21]This isn't right.
[192:06.41]From this survey, it would appear that one of our suspects is an expert at holding up taco stands.
[192:12.67]You're going to have to do it over.
[192:14.37]no problem anything else I think that'll do it always a pleasure left both right right is it because I like have is it capital and don't do capital letters maybe Los Angeles Earth
[192:44.51]Earth?
[192:45.88]Mars?
[192:49.06]Is it random?
[192:49.72]Did I spell it wrong?
[192:57.32]It's Planet X. You're doing the shitty lying voice.
[193:02.91]No, I swear, I promise you, I'm looking at a screenshot right now.
[193:05.69]Is this correct?
[193:11.39]Is this correct?
[193:16.13]Is this wrong?
[193:17.93]Spelling, spelling, spelling.
[193:23.24]You have to say Planet X. Like that?
[193:29.52]And Planet X. Yeah.
[193:33.53]Let's try that.
[193:49.45]Nancy, you do that survey over?
[193:51.48]Yep.
[193:52.46]Wait a sec.
[194:02.28]Machine's on.
[194:03.50]Go for it.
[194:04.98]Okay, come on, man.
[194:06.50]What the hell?
[194:09.60]But Bill Kessler likes to ice fish.
[194:11.76]Guadalupe Camillo is the one who likes to bird watch.
[194:14.38]Yanni Volksteyer is a champion skier.
[194:16.83]And Lou Talbot likes to snowshoe.
[194:18.83]That's right.
[194:24.51]There we go, finally.
[194:54.00]Finally.
[194:54.64]Something?
[194:55.18]Yes, to the display case.
[194:56.88]What is it?
[194:57.40]7669.
[194:57.70]So what is the point of that paper with the 7 and the 4?
[195:03.77]What was that even for?
[195:04.65]The mirror.
[195:06.03]That does it for now.
[195:06.87]Always a pleasure.
[195:17.00]Give me these damn things.
[195:26.30]That did it.
[195:29.50]I did that number already, but I had to do all that bullshit first.
[195:32.78]Okay, I got the snowshoes.
[195:34.52]Now, we're going back out to the ridge.
[195:36.20]I'm gonna go walk on the ice.
[195:38.72]I'm gonna go get a... Let me get the hand warmer.
[195:45.48]Stop!
[195:49.66]How dare you trespass here?
[195:51.52]You shall pay for your insolence.
[195:54.16]No!
[195:59.78]Thank you.
[196:09.54]Thank you!
[196:11.20]Okay now...
[196:24.24]I have to go... Not that way.
[196:28.16]Not that way.
[196:29.86]Not that way.
[196:31.40]This way.
[196:34.60]Snowshoes!
[196:44.47]See what's really going on here.
[196:55.76]Now, what's really going on?
[197:13.01]What happened to my snow thing?
[197:14.52]I just took it.
[197:15.10]Are you kidding me?
[197:25.20]Just in case I softlock myself.
[197:26.28]What's going on?
[197:39.53]I'm starting to get really cold.
[197:43.43]I can't stop shivering.
[197:45.88]I need to get in out of the cold.
[197:47.46]Looks like some kind of house.
[197:49.44]Could someone be living?
[197:50.68]Hello?
[197:51.88]Is anyone here?
[197:52.74]Fuck.
[197:54.14]Not another.
[197:54.80]Wait a minute.
[197:55.50]No, no, no, no, no.
[197:56.61]This is it.
[197:58.43]What is it?
[197:59.67]This is definitely it.
[198:00.85]What was it?
[198:01.27]Mirrored?
[198:03.05]Seven, nine.
[198:03.71]Alright.
[198:11.30]We're in.
[198:15.60]Is this a weird book?
[198:19.78]The Rest of My Life by Julius McQuaid.
[198:23.44]Yeah, I'm not reading all this.
[198:26.07]I'm not reading all this.
[198:28.29]No way.
[198:31.27]I don't know.
[198:31.97]It's too long.
[198:32.79]So once I get her attention by saying her name, I can give her commands.
[198:45.04]Hold on.
[198:47.53]Pick this diary up.
[198:49.23]Maybe I'll write in it.
[198:50.01]Okay.
[198:52.11]I miss somebody.
[198:52.79]I feel like I'm hiking around.
[198:54.50]I have to write to somebody even if it's my cell phone.
[198:56.88]Maybe.
[198:57.26]Probably not.
[198:59.74]Tired of writing these down.
[199:00.68]Tired of feeling...
[199:02.86]cage like an animal I spent 40 years working with three hours the train will reach edmonton maybe I'll get off maybe I won't I don't know the next day I woke up in my tent to the sound of distant gunshots this morning later I found a wolf pup it's all by herself stuck in a in a lunch um I figured out the hunting got him and mother since she was nowhere else around and since there is no way whatever
[199:30.41]extricate herself I started chopping through the brambles to free her it took me a while though and I was talking to her all the time trying to keep her from struggling and hurting herself so what I was really doing without meaning to was
[199:45.61]imprinting my voice and my scent on her brain because at first she went racing off but then later I noticed that she was following me even now she's sitting about 20 yards away despite my campfire just watching me I haven't fed her avoided touching her while I was cutting her free from the brambles yet she's there
[200:05.64]So, since this could be the beginning of an inter-esting relationship, I thought maybe I should take some notes, old habits of one, indeed, whatever.
[200:15.13]A week went by.
[200:16.27]The pup whose coat is pure white still shadows me wherever I go.
[200:20.71]Every day, she narrows the distance between us, which has been reduced to about 20 feet.
[200:25.40]If I get any closer, she runs.
[200:27.60]Another, like, month went by.
[200:28.76]The pup which has been, I've been calling, I can't, now keeps no less than seven feet between us at all times, distance which I am happy as well.
[200:37.42]I've watched her hunt for food, have seen what she can do with her teeth and jaws, and have no desire to even encounter either on a personal basis.
[200:45.82]I have revisited the urge to feed her, to make her in any way dependent on me, but I do talk to her.
[200:51.61]I can't help myself.
[200:52.39]I've discovered that talking in a very basic human need
[200:56.65]Alright, so the dog had a friend.
[200:59.87]I don't care.
[201:21.56]I said, hey, are there any plumbers in chat?
[201:23.58]I took apart my shower head and now I'm confused.
[201:26.37]I've been there before and it sucks.
[201:28.93]I've actually been there before and it kind of sucks trying to figure out what to do with it.
[201:37.52]Okay.
[201:38.82]Um, yeah, I've been there.
[201:40.36]I've been there, man.
[201:40.94]It sucks.
[201:42.04]Just, I don't know, at this point, just turn off, turn the water off and just call somebody that knows what they're doing.
[201:46.72]That's what I do.
[201:48.40]Like it or not, I've become hers.
[201:51.99]I'm not at all sure which.
[201:55.01]While she is never underfoot, preferring to remain at least three feet away from me most of the time.
[202:01.78]She does permit and occasionally seeks out a friendly pat or two on the head and shoulders.
[202:08.83]Although unlike most dogs, she doesn't seem to consider my touch to be any kind of reward.
[202:12.65]In fact, I sometimes feel that by letting me pet her, she's rewarding me.
[202:18.69]Like three months, four months have gone by.
[202:21.65]With the coming of the spring, I fully expect... Is it Isis to take off one day and never return?
[202:29.88]But so far that hasn't happened.
[202:32.80]She disappears for hours at a time.
[202:35.84]No doubt to hunt, but for some reason, she always returns.
[202:38.88]Another month.
[202:39.74]Last night, a wolf started howling in the distance.
[202:42.32]Isis sat, bolt upright, jolted, and listened to my hand.
[202:46.93]She was shaking when the howling ended.
[202:50.21]After a moment, she lay back down and went back to sleep.
[202:52.75]And I suddenly realized that she's not going to leave.
[202:55.93]Even...
[202:57.23]It was either the wilderness or me, and incredibly, she chose me.
[203:03.60]This is like another year.
[203:05.84]Isis is by far the smartest animal I have ever seen.
[203:08.94]By watching her carefully and reinforcing the commands, I can get her to perform those actions.
[203:17.38]Okay, so we...
[203:19.24]Okay, so we can literally just... I could have just turned to this page and said that I can give commands.
[203:24.74]Down, forward, jump, stay, bark, paw, left, right, around.
[203:31.71]This... Okay.
[203:33.79]I can give Isis not just one command, but many commands chained in a row and she'll carry them out one by one in order.
[203:40.33]I start with a chain of commands by saying Isis and I end the chain by saying go.
[203:46.68]For an
[203:48.62]Ability to sort objects by scent.
[203:50.83]Nobody's reading this.
[203:51.39]If she has an object in her mouth, she'll sniff, then drop the object near another object that has the same scent.
[204:01.25]Pinevale Hospital.
[204:02.41]Okay.
[204:02.85]Uh-oh.
[204:07.64]Sit!
[204:08.76]Sit!
[204:10.62]Sit, stay!
[204:12.64]Where's the turkey?
[204:14.38]Where's my raw turkey?
[204:15.50]Isis, stay.
[204:22.52]It worked.
[204:27.26]Okay.
[204:29.72]Isis, jump.
[204:30.54]Jump.
[204:31.94]Paw.
[204:32.76]Left.
[204:33.22]Right.
[204:34.08]Jump.
[204:34.60]Down.
[204:34.96]I'm going to stop here.
[204:37.03]Isis, jump.
[204:38.57]Paw.
[204:39.41]Left.
[204:40.27]Right.
[204:40.99]Jump.
[204:41.77]Down.
[204:42.45]Go.
[204:58.74]Jump, jump, down, down, left, right.
[205:03.38]I'm going to stop here.
[205:04.50]I can't read the Konami code.
[205:09.09]Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump.
[205:13.63]I'm going to stop.
[205:14.55]Isis.
[205:15.29]Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, go.
[205:20.26]Wow.
[205:31.81]This is so stupid.
[205:38.55]Why are we doing this?
[205:50.82]I mean, this is a really smart, intelligent dog.
[205:56.42]It seems like a really great animal, but like what?
[205:59.98]Why do I- Am I- Am I going to go out this way or what?
[206:05.84]Forward.
[206:07.51]Forward.
[206:08.25]ISIS.
[206:09.01]Forward.
[206:09.77]Forward.
[206:10.55]Forward.
[206:11.31]Forward.
[206:12.09]Forward.
[206:12.83]Go.
[206:20.13]Okay, so now- How about- Okay, so left?
[206:22.96]Left?

[207:00.36]Okay, so I think I want her to go out here.
[207:05.16]Right?
[207:06.35]No, get rid of this.
[207:08.31]Right.
[207:08.57]Forward.
[207:10.75]Down.
[207:11.79]What does that do?
[207:13.21]Right.
[207:13.89]Forward.
[207:14.69]Down.
[207:15.38]Go.
[207:17.64]Right.
[207:17.94]Forward.
[207:21.44]Down.
[207:31.05]Call it.
[207:31.75]This is just practice.
[207:33.23]Oh.
[207:33.35]What's that?
[207:33.81]Little bro distracted by Bop-It.
[207:57.83]Okay, well, I guess that's how it is.
[207:59.40]Okay.
[207:59.56]Is that it?
[208:32.32]I think that's it.
[208:34.62]Let's go back.
[208:36.63]Thanks for being a good dog.
[208:41.41]Another explosion.
[208:43.43]What the hell is going on out here?
[208:44.99]It wasn't the dog.
[208:52.51]The dog was with me.
[208:56.87]The dog was with me the whole time.
[209:04.36]Two vertebrae employed as furniture.
[209:07.06]Petrified.
[209:08.08]Wings from muscle attached.
[209:09.28]Missing.
[209:09.61]Otherwise in excellent condition.
[209:11.15]Big money.

[212:07.56]Anybody here?
[212:08.30]Let me go in.
[212:09.86]These weren't here before.
[212:11.09]That birthmark below his eye looks very familiar.
[212:16.69]Wait a minute.
[212:21.74]Somebody locked me in.
[212:25.42]Hey, is someone out there?
[212:27.12]The door is... I'm getting really, really hot.
[212:36.39]Well, we're dead.
[212:50.32]If I can just get cold water running through these pipes, I'll be OK.
[212:54.17]If I don't get these pipes adjusted soon, I'm not going to make it.
[213:08.41]I don't have much time.
[213:09.79]I've got to get these pipes lined up now.
[213:15.74]What's the right?
[213:16.30]I don't get it.
[213:17.10]Where's it coming from?
[213:17.94]Where's the water coming from?
[213:21.46]Hey, is someone out there?

[214:54.81]I'm running out of time.
[214:56.31]I've got to do something fast.
[214:58.28]Oh, you piece of shit.
[214:59.72]That's so awful.
[215:00.72]That's it, right?
[215:02.38]Go, go, go, go, go.
[215:03.46]That's got to be.
[215:04.44]Why?
[215:04.76]I've got to get these pipes aligned before I pass out from the heat.
[215:07.90]Every single one has to be connected.
[215:09.71]The whole thing.
[215:10.41]I can't just have one space.
[215:12.85]I don't have much time.
[215:14.27]I've got to get these pipes lined up now.
[215:17.78]How the fuck am I supposed to do this?
[215:21.17]I got it.
[215:21.61]I got it.
[215:21.89]I got it.
[215:22.25]I got it.
[215:22.75]Watch, watch, watch, watch, watch.
[215:24.29]I have to make a closed circle with the first part and then go up.
[215:28.84]This shit is bullshit.
[215:30.62]This is bullshit.
[215:32.00]Hey, is someone out there?
[215:34.20]The door's... I'm getting really, really hot.
[215:57.22]Dude, stop doing that!
[215:58.16]This sucks!
[216:00.32]Stop it!
[216:01.12]That was horrible.
[216:25.84]Nancy!
[216:26.90]Mr. Kessler?
[216:28.24]What are you doing down here?
[216:29.46]Trying to kill you!
[216:29.92]I came down here looking for Ollie, but then I heard all this noise and thought I'd better check it out.
[216:34.50]Door got stuck again, huh?
[216:36.86]Say, you look kind of bedraggled.
[216:39.76]Are you alright?
[216:40.84]I'm fine, and I'll be even better after you and I have a little talk.
[216:47.33]Yeah, that's me.
[216:49.23]When I was a kid, this place was practically my second home.
[216:52.71]My late grandmother, Tilly Wentworth, used to own it.
[216:56.58]Great.
[216:59.77]Why did you not open the door when I was dying in the sauna, screaming?
[217:02.67]I think that's the first question we ask after we get the police here.
[217:08.79]You know what I mean?
[217:10.06]That's the number one question.
[217:11.66]None of this other shit matters.
[217:19.93]Hmm.
[217:20.15]Hmm.
[217:20.33]Hmm.
[217:44.72]I had nothing to do with that explosion, Lou's window, the food poisoning, the icy stairs.
[217:50.15]None of that stuff.
[217:51.37]You ask me, it's karma.
[217:53.01]The Malikways are just getting what's coming to them.
[217:55.59]How about another game of Fox and Geese?
[217:58.35]How about another game of Fox and Geese?
[218:00.81]Now you're talking.
[218:02.09]Have a seat.
[218:03.05]Ready?
[218:03.51]Okay.
[218:05.87]Actually, I changed my mind.
[218:07.54]I don't want to play right now.
[218:09.30]Okay.
[218:10.52]So what can I do for you?
[218:13.33]Since he used to spend so much time here, do you know if there's a way to get into Trapper Dan's needle?
[218:18.47]You know that pyramid thing on the table over there by the entrance to the dining room?
[218:22.94]If you fool around with it until nothing but pigs show on the outside, this compartment will open up and inside will be this round magnetic thing that used to be Trapper Dan's special master key.
[218:34.52]Just hold it up by the needle and a hidden door will pop open.
[218:39.13]Are you telling me that I did every animal besides pig?
[218:42.33]I did at least two of them.
[218:43.65]And just said no.
[218:45.45]But that was the solution.
[218:46.45]I would have beat the game.
[218:49.30]If it was all pigs, it would have opened and I would have got the key to that tower and I would have beat the game.
[218:54.66]Four hours ago.
[218:55.40]Five hours ago.
[218:58.97]Why did he need a special master key?
[219:01.19]Who knows?
[219:02.33]I mean, let's face it.
[219:03.74]Living all by himself way out here in the wild, winter after long, dark winter, Trapper Dan was probably stark raving bonkers.
[219:11.72]It was two days ago.
[219:14.22]But we wouldn't have all these lovely memories.
[219:16.03]You know, that's true.
[219:17.13]I better get going.
[219:18.67]Okie dokie.
[219:19.27]That's a good point.
[219:21.83]Okay, so let's go do that.
[219:23.17]Although that would have been kind of funny.
[219:30.50]Okay, all pigs.
[219:32.12]So what is right before pig?
[219:33.86]It is wolf.
[219:37.70]We have to get these all to be wolf.
[219:44.84]Thankfully, I already did this puzzle a lot of times.
[219:48.74]I already know what to do.
[219:49.66]Okay, now we go like this.
[220:00.24]That's fine.
[220:05.40]That's fine.
[220:06.80]That's fine.
[220:08.58]That's fine.
[220:10.28]That's fine.
[220:11.00]Okay.
[220:11.94]Thankfully, open it up.
[220:13.44]Oh, come on.
[220:14.28]So, what was the point of that?
[220:15.44]All for nothing?
[220:32.37]Really?
[220:35.79]Wake up.
[220:36.77]He's not in there.
[220:37.43]Huh?
[220:38.94]Oh.
[220:39.92]Now what?
[220:40.82]I opened up that pyramid like you told me, but there was nothing inside.
[220:44.32]There wasn't?
[220:46.08]Oh.
[220:47.14]Well, I'm afraid you're out of luck.
[220:49.69]Could that magnetic key thing be somewhere else?
[220:52.81]You know, Grandma Tilly once told me that if you turn the top of the pyramid 45 degrees, then fill all the boxes on the outside with one kind of animal, then another kind of animal, until you do that for all four animals, she said if you do that, you'd find a journal in there written by Trapper Dan himself.
[221:10.68]So just do every animal?
[221:13.58]Did you ever read it?
[221:15.08]I was a kid.
[221:16.00]What would I want to read some crazy old cooch journal for?
[221:21.77]So go there and turn into an animal and then another animal and then another animal.
[221:25.45]What?
[221:36.54]Now what is this?
[221:41.14]What does it want me to do?
[221:42.00]Do I have to get it all the rows like this?
[221:56.09]So just one, two, okay, hold on.
[222:03.95]So one row of raccoons, a row of wolf, a row of pig, and a row of mesas.
[222:10.63]I think that's what it wants me to do.
[222:16.11]So to get this correct, we need to line this up.
[222:21.57]So it'll always be, so what is right before wolf?
[222:26.18]This has to be that what is right before pig that, and then right before this is raccoon.
[222:34.82]So if we go like that, that's correct, but it ha okay.
[222:39.66]So that's good.
[222:40.20]So this, this don't touch this line.
[222:41.64]This line is this line's fine.
[222:42.84]Okay.
[222:50.46]Oh, I messed it up.
[222:51.20]It's alright.
[222:58.58]Oh shit, you're really gonna fuck with me here now, aren't you?
[223:02.51]Okay.
[223:05.87]Okay.
[223:07.85]You're ignoring chat.
[223:08.81]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[223:10.14]Please, please.
[223:10.58]Stop, stop, stop.
[223:11.32]What, what, what, what, what, what?
[223:12.10]Am I doing it the hard way?
[223:13.96]Just do it.
[223:28.72]Okay.
[223:29.10]Alright.
[223:29.50]I'm working on it.
[223:54.45]Yeah.
[224:21.63]Oh, fuck.
[224:45.82]Now, oh boy.
[224:46.72]Okay, I messed it up.
[224:58.81]The whole thing screwed up.
[225:03.14]Okay, I need to think about this for a sec.
[225:09.94]It moves everything around it.
[225:14.62]So I gotta get all these to... Oh, this hurts my head.
[225:21.50]This hurts my head.
[225:27.10]This hurts my head.
[225:29.69]You gotta start... Okay, so you... Corner and here.
[225:38.13]Oh, fuck.
[225:55.11]Oh, man.
[225:55.63]I think you have to start in the corner.
[226:05.68]Alright, get everything to... What is it?
[226:09.10]Everything has to be... Everything has to be raccoon.
[226:12.54]Or at least close to it.
[226:18.59]This should do it.
[226:21.67]This, get all these to raccoon.
[226:23.29]Okay.
[226:23.71]Okay.
[226:27.12]And this should do that.
[226:28.24]That should do this.
[226:33.92]Close.
[226:34.34]There it is.
[226:36.13]Yeah!
[226:38.75]LOL, the D4 beta is over.
[226:40.61]Oh, well.
[226:41.97]Daniel Weissnitz.
[226:43.55]Better known as Trapper Dan, I'll bet.
[226:49.90]A hi-he-ho-ho to you for discovering my hidden journal.
[226:55.32]No doubt you already found my magnetic key that unlocks my needle and the rooms.
[227:00.62]Keep my secrets safe, especially from the Mounties and those rascally squirrels.
[227:06.14]Devious varmints.
[227:09.49]One thing's for certain without an intelligent creature that can crawl through small spaces such as my beloved Mary, you won't be able to use my vaults.
[227:18.34]fixed the vault passageways so you can see if your animal is dumb or smart by getting lost in the vaults make sure your pet can jump as there are pits in there and has paws or hooves to make the move the levers the first thing you need to do is crack my cipher below or just follow the moose wolf raccoon and Mary looks like the rest is in some kind of code
[227:41.28]I think I get it.
[228:13.44]I don't.
[228:15.18]What are you saying?
[228:16.62]What is this?
[228:18.82]I have to do this?
[228:20.40]More of this?
[228:23.78]Any combination will work.
[228:27.42]Can't find Mary?
[228:28.22]Well, try pulling on that rope above the vaults.
[228:31.18]It'll open a surprise at the end of the hallway on the second floor.
[228:34.74]Keep it taut.
[228:35.98]Mary always helped me with that one.
[228:38.10]She got through the maze.
[228:39.74]You just need three more keys to open the keyholes.
[228:46.00]Oh my goodness gracious.
[228:49.54]These are the locks on the doors that need to match the animal that need to... This thing is made of stone.
[228:58.89]What does this shit say again?
[229:19.29]No, where's this guy's journal?
[229:28.64]Isn't this it?
[229:32.38]Where's the journal?
[229:43.05]So the raccoons need to be...
[229:47.23]The pigs... So the pigs need to be in... Is this like the order?
[230:02.18]So raccoons go in these two slots or something?
[230:06.46]I don't really... Fox and the geese.
[230:19.20]What is this?
[230:19.76]This is blue.
[230:20.64]Alright, these are the hotel... Okay, so blue, red, white.
[230:26.14]Green, blue, red.
[230:27.84]Please remember that for me.
[230:29.04]I have to go do this to the rooms upstairs.
[230:38.03]Blue?
[230:41.03]I already forgot it.
[230:48.23]I already forgot it.
[230:51.70]Blue, red, white.
[230:54.45]Blue, red, white.
[231:06.11]Blue, red, white.
[231:08.57]Then green, blue, red.
[231:26.22]I did it.
[231:27.08]Now what?
[231:29.78]Oh my goodness.
[231:30.61]This is one of those games where you can click out of the window accidentally and it minimizes and rechanges all your resolutions.
[231:36.91]Wrong order.
[231:41.65]Alright, looking straight down this way.
[231:44.53]Left side is blue.
[231:46.27]Like I'm talking from me forward.
[231:53.09]On the left we've got blue.
[231:57.78]Blue, red, white, green, blue, red.
[232:00.30]So blue, red, white, green, blue, red.
[232:08.31]Go to the end of the hall.
[232:08.99]Start at the end of the hall.
[232:09.79]This isn't an emergency.
[232:11.29]I better not open it.
[232:12.69]Okay, so we've got... Looking this way.
[232:16.59]Starting at the fireplace.
[232:18.04]Blue... Red... Blue, red...
[232:30.03]Okay.
[232:30.85]Blue?
[232:34.97]Stop!
[232:35.53]Oh my god, I hate it.
[232:36.90]I hate this.
[232:39.42]I wish I could just move.
[232:42.38]This side is... So this is blue... What was it?
[232:45.76]Blue, white, red?
[232:46.44]And green... Infinite content, Omega Lull.
[232:52.73]Hold on now.
[232:55.93]Blue, red, white on the right side.
[233:01.38]Blue, red, white, green, blue, red.
[233:03.75]Blue, red, white.
[233:04.95]That's what I was gonna say.
[233:20.70]Green.
[233:22.02]No, close this door.
[233:26.28]What just happened?
[233:27.75]Where am I?
[233:28.09]What am I looking at?
[233:29.53]Turn back around.
[233:31.67]Green.
[233:37.63]Blue.
[233:40.99]Red.
[233:41.33]That it?
[233:47.96]I don't know if that did anything.
[233:59.88]I'm taking a picture of my fucking phone.
[234:01.28]I don't even care.
[234:06.02]I'm literally taking a picture of this with my phone.
[234:13.10]That's what a normal, sane human being would do.
[234:16.12]Just take a picture of this.
[234:17.00]Okay.
[234:22.61]Here it is.
[234:24.39]Got it.
[234:25.05]Done.
[234:27.23]Go.
[234:27.33]Go.
[234:30.37]Got it.
[234:35.93]Alright, from the fireplace.
[234:37.85]We've got, on the left side, green, blue, red.
[234:42.27]Stop turning around!
[234:54.86]On the right side, it is blue.
[235:01.71]Okay.
[235:02.65]Next, we've got blue and red.
[235:04.19]Blue on left side.
[235:12.07]Close that fucking door.
[235:14.75]Red on this side.
[235:18.57]The final hallway is red on the left side.
[235:29.82]White on the other side.
[235:34.49]Done.
[235:36.11]I got it.
[235:43.07]What is going on?
[235:44.15]So this should be white on the left, red on the right.
[235:50.82]It is.
[235:53.78]The middle should be red on the left, blue on the right.
[235:58.25]It is.
[236:00.63]Blue on the right.
[236:03.58]And the final ones should be blue on the left, green on the right.
[236:10.90]What's going on?
[236:15.56]Yeah, I did it from the fireplace.
[236:17.04]Looking like from the fireplace.
[236:19.58]From the fireplace, it's green, blue, red on the left and blue, red, white on the right.
[236:26.56]I'm looking at it right now.
[236:28.24]What about the fireplace?
[236:29.27]Check the fireplace.
[236:34.79]Do I have to turn the fireplace on?
[236:36.73]Do I?
[236:43.21]You need to put fire in the fireplace.
[236:45.70]You did it right.
[236:46.14]You have to do something else.
[236:46.96]Oh, okay.
[236:54.36]Okay.
[237:00.57]I keep mistaking this for the...
[237:04.94]Okay, you use my vault.
[237:07.28]Make sure you have a dog.
[237:11.22]Right?
[237:12.66]Okay.
[237:13.12]Three keys.
[237:19.79]I did that.
[237:22.99]So now that's done.
[237:27.62]Throw all the books into the fireplace.
[237:29.14]They're pretty useless anyways.
[237:33.76]So now the raccoon?
[237:38.00]With this?
[237:38.50]Is everybody else as lost as I am?
[238:30.96]As for the rooms, well, you'll just have to bust down the doors and remake the key.
[238:36.53]Crack my cipher below.
[238:39.94]Can I just crack this code?
[238:41.12]I kind of want to hold this up too.
[238:43.47]It'll have like the translator app, like take it or something.
[238:46.57]You know what I mean?
[238:53.01]What's this code?
[238:54.49]Cipher this code.
[239:01.08]I don't know what this is trying to tell me though.
[239:05.05]Like, very obviously, this is that pyramid.
[239:06.45]And they're talking about this is where the raccoon was placed.
[239:08.61]So, the left side, most left side on the left was raccoon image.
[239:13.71]It's telling me to do whatever this is.
[239:16.34]And it wants me to spin it around.
[239:27.34]Go play the game of geese and fox.
[239:31.77]Didn't I already do that, though?
[239:32.99]Do I actually have to play that with this guy?
[239:37.96]hello again I better get going okie dokie what's up I'll catch you later hello again I'll see you two later okay see you later any combination will work what's up oh my god nice talking to you I just wish there was a different button I could press to like leave instead of having to go to like this magic five pixel area at the bottom of the screen
[240:17.38]What is this even talking about?
[240:20.80]My vaults?
[240:25.87]There's like a whole underground world we haven't been to.
[240:28.15]It's a maze underground, apparently.
[240:29.89]Do I have to go back to where that needle is and just go there?
[240:54.52]Those are the pyramid clues.
[240:57.62]Any combination will work, but I don't... It's a raccoon.
[241:04.04]But, I don't know, they spit it around with a weird fucking line in the middle.
[241:07.40]What does this even mean?
[241:10.10]If you wanted me to spin it around, why would you draw a line in the middle?
[241:12.42]Is this a letter?
[241:13.28]What is this?
[241:18.93]And then, I thought this was a lobster until I realized it was the moose.
[241:26.06]So, but, where do you, why is there, and there's like a slice of pizza here.
[241:36.49]Is this a pig?
[241:42.99]This is a pig.
[241:43.89]So this is a pig's face here.
[241:47.62]What's this, what's the, is there, hold on, let me look at this pyramid again.
[242:00.69]There ain't any geese.
[242:04.11]There's no goose.
[242:05.21]There's no ducks.
[242:11.66]Why my secret hideout?
[242:16.82]Fox and geese.
[242:17.44]There is a pig, moose, raccoon, and a wolf design on the fox and geese game table.
[242:23.12]Well, I would love these assholes to get the fuck up from the table so I can look at the stupid thing.
[242:43.57]I can't look at it.
[242:46.81]This needs to be lunchtime, but I can't sit here.
[242:52.77]Apologize to them.
[242:53.61]No, I'm not going to.
[242:56.15]I'm just going to go.
[242:56.67]I'm just going to bed.
[242:57.55]I'm just going up there.
[242:58.28]I'm going to hit the button fucking 10 times in a row.
[243:06.40]Wait, something on the bed.
[243:07.40]That's not.
[243:23.08]Get out of my fucking way.
[243:36.57]Oh my god.
[243:38.93]I have to walk up here and turn around.
[243:41.37]I want to look at the table!
[243:43.93]Alright, I'm getting tantrum-y here.
[244:03.41]Someone's telling me how to do the code.
[244:06.37]Take the first line.
[244:08.71]Okay, hold on.
[244:10.13]Take the first letter of the first line, then the first letter of the second line.
[244:17.40]The second letter of the first line, then the second letter of the second line.
[244:25.66]what the first letter of the first line and then this first so it's first things first dude you have to write this out I have to actually write this down on a piece of paper hold on
[244:54.65]First, oh, somebody has it.
[244:55.99]First things first, locate my secret hideout up in the mountains.
[244:59.06]It's so secret, you'll probably never find it.
[245:00.96]But if you do, find my Rex bone and use it in the wall of my hideout.
[245:04.76]That'll open up the secret lock.
[245:06.10]You could have just said that in three words, Dan, whatever your name is.
[245:15.09]My secret hideout up in the mountains.
[245:17.73]Find my Rex bone.
[245:19.37]That didn't help at all.
[245:23.12]Find my Rex bone?
[245:29.38]Wasn't it telling me that this shit was made out of, like, Rex bones?
[245:42.75]This thing right here.
[245:43.45]Yeah, so what the hell?
[245:54.54]Go back to where you met Isis.
[245:58.78]I have to go back to fucking bed, first of all.
[246:29.21]I feel like this game has gotten very convoluted in the end.
[246:32.96]Go to my magical pyramid and press the button on the top and then do a bunch of weird shit.
[246:36.62]And by the way, decipher my code.
[246:38.84]If you can't do that, get the bone and put it... I'm trying to find... Where is this bone?
[246:49.47]You miss serving breakfast?
[246:50.63]I don't give a shit.
[246:52.41]Go order takeout for all I care.
[247:21.55]Why is he so mad?
[247:22.43]What happened?
[247:23.17]I'm not mad.
[247:23.63]I'm frustrated.
[247:24.25]Okay.
[247:45.32]So now where is this thing?
[247:55.89]I already know whose it is.
[247:57.69]What?
[247:57.83]I don't even know what that means.
[248:26.10]And smell this.
[248:28.57]How do I get the dog to smell this?
[248:56.18]You do not have to hand it, okay?
[249:02.56]You use a guidebook.
[249:03.78]Yeah, this shit's empty.
[249:15.82]It's empty.
[249:16.56]I can't get it.
[249:17.94]We have a Vinny raid coming in right now.
[249:19.86]Vinny, I'm having trouble.
[249:21.34]I'm having trouble.
[249:21.88]I need help from the Vinesauce community if you can help us.
[249:25.84]Trying to figure out playing Nancy Drew right now.
[249:28.78]And I'm stuck.
[249:32.46]Thanks for the raid.
[249:33.18]Welcome.
[249:36.56]Having a little bit of trouble in the game.
[249:40.10]Somebody says, there's a couple of key things you need to find if you actually want to progress.
[249:42.30]What you need to look for is some good old-fashioned values.
[249:44.76]It's a Family Guy routine.
[249:45.76]They're doing a Family Guy joke.
[249:49.03]I read the rest of it.
[249:49.89]Not going to read the rest.
[249:53.33]Translate the rest of the words.
[250:01.34]I don't...
[250:08.11]What?
[250:08.25]Radioactivity?
[250:08.63]There's a number I could call on this weird thing, right?
[250:10.61]Okay, I can call that.
[250:11.13]Um... I gotta leave?
[250:37.40]right right ISIS right right right right go I don't really know what the game wants me to do smell stuff but how do you smell this
[251:08.65]Bark.
[251:09.63]Smell.
[251:10.17]Smell this.
[251:26.49]I need to put the bone here.
[251:30.04]But I don't have the bone.
[251:31.28]Somebody stole the bone.
[251:32.44]I don't know who has the bone in their possession.
[251:44.57]How do they ever expect children to do this stuff?
[251:47.43]I don't... How?
[251:50.37]Even with an adult's help, I would have been like... Like, son or daughter... No, close that game.
[251:56.39]No, open up fucking Nickelodeon.
[251:58.55]You know what I mean?
[251:59.09]Like, get off of this.
[252:00.63]This is too much.
[252:01.44]Get off of this.
[252:02.22]Go watch Rugrats.
[252:22.13]You did choose senior difficulty, to be fair.
[252:25.14]Yeah, because if I picked the other difficulty, everyone would have made fun of me.
[252:40.19]Tell the dog to figure it out.
[252:42.37]I feel like this hole, just, can I tell, can you leave?
[252:45.57]Can you leave the hole?
[252:48.31]Like...
[252:50.00]This is very clearly saying, hey, look, there's a space the dog can fit under here.
[252:53.96]There's no way that's not what this is.
[252:55.36]No way.
[253:08.67]Very cute, but didn't do anything.
[253:11.12]Wait, someone's got a solution.
[253:12.64]Go back to Isis at the shack past Avalanche Ridge.
[253:14.94]Exit the lodge, go left.
[253:17.64]At this point, I'm just going to listen to you.
[253:20.63]I'm going to listen to you.
[253:27.57]Go left.
[253:34.23]Left at the corner of the lodge.
[253:35.83]Left again.
[253:36.47]So, go left.
[253:47.47]Go left.
[253:47.91]Left at the corner of the lodge.
[253:50.46]Wait, what's happening?
[253:53.47]Go right by the lodge and left into the sauce space.
[253:56.07]You're not helping.
[253:58.39]I already had the shack.
[254:00.41]That was the shack.
[254:01.73]Wait a second.
[254:02.41]I need to... I'm gonna uninstall this fucking game.
[254:05.35]I swear to god.
[254:08.99]I swear to god.
[254:10.63]It made me drop... I just dropped my chapstick on the ground and I'm pissed about it.
[254:16.99]Okay, I'm at the lodge.
[254:19.09]Go left
[254:23.35]No, I can't go left.
[254:26.27]Exit the, exit the lodge.
[254:29.59]I can't even turn around.
[254:30.33]Okay.
[254:30.63]Exit the lodge.
[254:31.31]Go left.
[254:32.93]I'm going to follow this.
[254:45.87]I don't apply it every 30 minutes.
[254:46.93]I apply it every an hour, 30 minutes.
[254:48.86]Okay.
[254:49.30]Left.
[254:52.13]Left at the corner of the lodge, left again at the next corner.
[254:55.53]What?
[255:04.98]No, the- no, not the shack, the- the lo- okay, not the shack, the lodge, the actual lodge where I came from.
[255:10.78]Wait, didn't I already come back here?
[255:12.58]It's just- it's telling me to go back to where I just was.
[255:22.24]Go back.
[255:22.58]Yeah, why?
[255:23.16]What do you mean?
[255:23.56]Go back to ISIS at the shack past ridge.
[255:27.19]Exit the lodge.
[255:28.09]Go left.
[255:28.93]Wait, what are you talking about?
[255:30.75]I just did that.
[255:32.29]I need to read this.
[255:33.85]Go left at the corner.
[255:36.07]After the avalanche sign, use the snowshoes.
[255:37.89]We already did this.
[255:38.83]Go forward until the shack.
[255:39.89]Give the notebook with pictures to ISIS.
[255:42.79]Why?
[255:43.13]I was just, I didn't read the whole paragraph yet.
[255:46.29]Alright.
[255:50.82]My game is alt tabbed.
[255:57.74]Ah, warm again.
[255:58.98]Fuck this.
[256:03.78]I don't want to say it.
[256:14.77]For the notebook with the pictures, didn't I try that already?
[256:22.57]We did that already.
[256:25.98]We did this, it just didn't do anything.
[256:35.91]It's one of those games where you have to do A, B, C, D, E, F, G, even if you have G in your inventory.
[256:41.53]We just saw it with the stupid survey thing.
[257:09.11]Okay.
[257:10.35]Here's the notebook.
[257:12.59]Smell that.
[257:14.39]It doesn't work.
[257:20.17]I can't even pick this up.
[257:25.26]I have to talk to everyone in the main lodge.
[257:27.50]I don't even know what anything smells like.
[257:32.83]Like, what is this-
[257:41.93]Hold on, this is funny.
[257:46.21]Okay, somebody asked chat GPD.
[257:51.00]Great.
[257:51.56]In Nancy Drew, the White Wolf of Icicle Creek, there's a puzzle that involves snow, wolves, and triangle puzzles.
[257:57.03]To solve this puzzle, you need to first collect all the triangle pieces scattered throughout the game.
[258:00.87]Once you have all the triangle pieces, go to the room with the wolf display and arrange the triangles to form a wolf picture.
[258:06.13]This will reveal a hidden compartment that contains a snowshoe.
[258:09.17]Use the snowshoe to traverse the snowy area.
[258:12.55]Well, that's not accurate.
[258:13.91]That didn't help at all.
[258:19.48]So we gotta go back to the lodge and get things- ask people for stuff that the dog can smell?
[258:28.07]Why would I do that?
[258:30.93]Okay.
[258:44.38]This is actually a Wind Waker quest.
[258:46.99]This is actually driving me crazy.
[258:52.29]It's going to get dark soon and cold.
[258:54.89]I'm going in.
[258:55.67]Going in where?
[258:58.07]I feel warmer already.
[258:59.57]Let's get Luigi'd.
[259:12.90]Go to the basement.
[259:13.76]Go to the workbench and get a red rug.
[259:16.62]Everybody's just telling me the solutions.
[259:20.54]I mean, they're kind of... I mean, come on.
[259:33.31]Go to the workbench.
[259:35.17]I'll let you get back to work.
[259:36.81]See you later.
[259:42.82]How can I help you?
[259:44.76]I hear that a major cross-country skiing competition may be held in this area in a couple of years.
[259:49.65]This is very true.
[259:50.87]It will rival the Olympics.
[259:58.90]I also hear that you can be pretty imaginative when it comes to gaining an edge on your competition.
[260:04.38]I told you about the bomb.
[260:05.90]My competitors will stop at nothing to defeat me.
[260:08.82]I am forced to seek out and exploit every possible advantage open to me.
[260:13.66]I take no pride in some of the things I've done to bring victory to my country, but I have no choice.
[260:20.96]I would love to stop clicking out of the window.
[260:23.74]I have disturbed you long enough.
[260:25.46]We'll talk again, I'm sure.
[260:31.02]Okay.
[260:32.30]Um... I need to... There's just a certain order to... This is a granny-like.
[260:37.13]I'm conceding that.
[260:38.29]This is a granny-like.
[260:39.83]I didn't think it was, but it is.
[260:41.95]Everything has to be done in a specific fucking particular order.
[260:45.77]Or it won't work.
[260:47.15]It's a granny-like.
[260:49.12]And I'm being chased by my own embarrassment from the chatroom.
[260:52.81]That's what's chasing me around these rooms.
[260:54.71]Laughing at me, pointing at me.
[260:56.07]You're the granny in this situation.
[260:57.59]It is a granny, like... I would love to put the bullet down.
[261:04.26]That's all the questions I had.
[261:05.82]Good.
[261:08.46]I would love to put this down, but I have a full, full fucking inventory!
[261:14.39]Oh, no, I don't.
[261:14.97]Relax.
[261:17.71]Relax.
[261:18.25]Everything's fine.
[261:19.03]There's no problem.
[261:23.84]I just keep clicking out of this stupid thing.
[261:32.58]Please give me the one correct route to go up the stairs.
[261:35.62]Oh my god.
[261:38.96]Okay.
[261:42.60]Okay.
[261:43.22]Cool.
[261:43.60]I made it out of the basement.
[261:44.62]Now what?
[261:51.39]He's having a meltdown.
[261:52.49]It's getting there.
[261:55.58]Do I have the laundry bag in my gigantic inventory of old notes that I don't even know why I'm keeping any of these?
[261:59.60]What's the point of me holding on to the shit in my inventory?
[262:02.85]Why do I have this?
[262:03.45]Throw it in the trash.
[262:04.29]Throw this away.
[262:04.77]I don't need it.
[262:05.13]Throw it away.
[262:05.59]I don't need it.
[262:06.53]Get rid of it.
[262:07.11]Throw it in the trash.
[262:08.17]Where's the trash can?
[262:21.15]Fucking laundry bag.
[262:25.44]He's losing it.
[262:26.44]I am!
[262:29.12]I should have picked, alright, if I ever play a Nancy Drew game ever again, I am picking the children.
[262:36.63]Whatever the, I'm picking like the junior detective mode.
[262:42.99]I ain't picking the senior detective mode.
[262:45.21]That, back in like the mid-2000s, that was telling you, hey dude, this is gonna be, this is gonna suck.
[262:51.18]Don't do that.
[262:53.16]This is like not even, this is higher than parents' difficulty.
[262:55.48]This is bring this to school and give it to your teacher difficulty.
[262:58.20]This is your teacher's gonna look at it and go, I don't fucking know what this is.
[263:00.66]Go sit down.
[263:03.39]Okay.
[263:05.79]So, we're gonna go to bed.
[263:14.05]We're gonna wake up at 1am, apparently.
[263:20.12]Okay.
[263:21.04]I got it out.
[263:21.52]I feel fine.
[263:29.41]I can't go in.
[263:30.13]If I unlock the door and someone's inside, yikes.
[263:39.68]Why am I waking up at 1 o'clock in the morning?
[263:43.29]Why is that happening?
[263:44.83]Can somebody help me here?
[263:46.33]Why am I waking up at 1 o'clock in the morning every day?
[263:49.07]Why?
[264:09.04]They don't need their rooms cleaned anymore.
[264:12.96]Okay.
[264:13.52]Take all the laundry.
[264:16.98]I think I'll keep one of these washcloths.
[264:21.03]Okay.
[264:21.83]Good.
[264:24.69]Excellent.
[264:25.87]Very nice.
[264:29.85]There we go.
[264:30.29]Okay.
[264:33.27]Now let's keep going.
[264:43.30]Excellent.
[264:44.64]Very cool.
[264:45.70]Very good.
[264:46.08]Okay, I've got these.
[264:47.08]There's one more, right?
[264:53.80]No.
[264:54.22]That's it.
[264:57.29]That's it.
[264:59.11]I've got the three that I need.
[265:03.03]You're not making the beds?
[265:04.53]I don't care.
[265:05.21]They're going to fire me anyways.
[265:06.13]I don't care.
[265:13.49]Fine.
[265:13.75]This one's already done.
[265:16.75]Alright, so I've got these.
[265:17.63]Now I have to bring this to the dog.
[265:22.59]I believe these are the only three.
[265:24.65]Please get out of the room.
[265:36.42]Nancy Drew killed Diablo.
[265:40.46]Now, I missed one.
[265:41.72]What am I missing?
[265:44.22]There wasn't one in the other room.
[265:52.31]No, I don't want to get... This is my room, right?
[265:57.85]There wasn't any in one of these rooms, though.
[266:09.24]I need the other.
[266:10.38]Oh, I need to go to the workbench, right?
[266:18.78]That's where you get the other... That dude's rag.
[266:22.69]You're losing viewers?
[266:23.91]That's fine.
[266:24.29]It's alright.
[266:32.93]It's okay.
[266:34.97]Alright.
[266:36.11]So now... This per... No, I don't want to do that.
[266:39.41]How do I put... Just put it away.
[266:45.53]I don't want to carry dirty laundry around all day.
[266:48.17]I should get rid of this bag.
[266:49.47]I'm going to kick this door down.
[266:52.31]What?
[266:52.65]What's going on?
[267:04.08]I should get rid of this laundry bag before I forget.
[267:23.62]How do I get his?
[267:24.54]I need his.
[267:25.42]How do I get his?
[267:27.74]Go upstairs, enter and go to the moose head right.
[267:30.04]Click on the moose's eye.
[267:31.44]Take the moose disk.
[267:32.04]Click the radio.
[267:32.36]This is worse than a granny leg.
[267:54.25]Go upstairs to Yanni's room.
[267:56.83]Enter and go to the moose head right of the door.
[267:58.93]Click on the moose's eye.
[267:59.89]Take the moose disk.
[268:01.13]Look at the radio.
[268:02.11]Click on the radio and there's a foreign... Somebody's talking.
[268:05.61]And then talk to Yanni in the basement about the radio.
[268:09.15]Jesus.
[268:21.59]What the hell is this you're saying?
[268:26.37]Is it third room?
[268:27.11]It's not a moose head.
[268:35.76]Oh, give me a fucking break.
[268:37.36]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[268:38.74]Oh, no.
[268:38.94]Click on a moose's head to get a key item.
[268:41.54]Oh.
[269:02.44]Alright, now go.
[269:04.18]Hey, what's the radio in your room?
[269:18.81]Okay.
[269:20.16]Now let's go talk to you about the radio I found in the room.
[269:25.10]Hi.
[269:25.26]What's that?
[269:25.62]You've got the disk?
[269:31.13]All I know is when I got done cleaning the moose head, that compartment was open.
[269:36.38]And when I looked in it, there was the radio.
[269:38.94]Now you answer my question.
[269:41.04]I use that radio to communicate with my coaches.
[269:44.21]It's a special radio.
[269:45.51]It scrambles the signal so that my competitors cannot listen in.
[269:49.34]How did you know there was a secret compartment in your room?
[269:52.42]The first night I was here, I searched for bugs.
[269:55.38]Something which, due to the cunning of my competitors, I've become very good at.
[270:00.06]I discovered that by pushing on the moose eye, a compartment opened up.
[270:04.40]What I don't know is, did you really open that compartment by mistake or were you up to something else?
[270:10.34]I'm a detective.
[270:11.56]I'm a detective.
[270:12.66]I'm a detective.
[270:13.42]I'm a detective.
[270:14.18]Shut up.
[270:17.12]I'm no spy, Mr. Volksteyer.
[270:19.26]I'm just very observant.
[270:20.98]Who else have you told about the radio?
[270:23.60]No one.
[270:24.60]I believe you, Nancy.
[270:26.06]So if I find out you're lying, both of us will be very sorry.
[270:30.22]Okay.
[270:32.64]You're busy, so I'll let you go.
[270:34.32]Hold on, I'll be right back.
[270:34.98]Come back anytime.
[270:35.82]I got to get the crime disk from out of that, whatever that was.
[270:39.95]I'll be back.
[270:40.37]Hold on, just be right back.
[270:43.71]I'm going to get the crime disk out of your room.
[270:57.87]Alright, now where is it?
[270:58.77]Did I get it?
[271:04.65]Okay, got it.
[271:13.49]Alright, now show him the crime disk.
[271:22.59]Okay.
[271:25.11]Make him take off the wetsuit.
[271:35.27]How can I help you?
[271:36.77]Do you have any proof that your competitors are out there spying on you?
[271:40.75]When one has enemies, it's prudent to assume that they are always close by.
[271:44.84]They are here, Nancy.
[271:46.74]Make no mistake.
[271:48.50]Can you imagine?
[271:50.26]We have a conversation here.
[271:52.66]I found this hidden radio up in your, uh, room.
[271:56.10]You did?
[271:56.79]Oh, well, that was nothing.
[271:58.13]Why were you in my room looking through my things?
[272:00.91]Well, because I was, I'm a detective.
[272:02.83]I'm trying to find, like, a killer and who's trying to kill people and shit.
[272:06.01]Oh, don't do that again.
[272:06.89]Okay.
[272:07.79]Yeah, I won't.
[272:08.71]And then I turn around and I fucking sprint up the fucking stairs and they, and he hears above him me running up the other fucking stairs.
[272:22.93]you chasing am I getting chased you're busy so I'll let you go that's how fast I was going pleasure okay so now I can take that thing what you need I'll let you get back to work if you need anything just holler everything's good we're fine
[272:52.61]Okay, so now where do I take that thing?
[273:00.23]This goes into... It goes into a slot.
[273:11.03]Is it fire?
[273:12.03]Fireplace?
[273:32.19]You need to look for the shotgun behind the front desk.
[273:49.65]There'll be a buckshot under the rug.
[273:54.90]Come on, man.
[273:56.32]The fire necklace will tell you all you need to open up Sly Raccoon's hiding place.
[274:00.68]Just don't wake up in the... Yeah, this is very helpful.
[274:04.82]Don't wake... Go back and take a look at the fire necklace at the display table.
[274:09.60]Take note of the colors of the discs.
[274:11.04]Go back up to the guest rooms.
[274:12.77]Look close at the colored wedges above the doorknobs.
[274:15.97]Yeah.
[274:16.39]Here, click.
[274:17.03]Look at the picture of the raccoon between... Yeah?
[274:35.40]I would never would have clicked on this.
[274:37.17]I just wouldn't have.
[274:38.89]I never would have clicked the random painting on the wall.
[274:43.39]I never would have done that.
[274:45.95]Okay.
[274:48.96]So, how do I get the pig one?
[274:51.78]This is the pig.
[274:52.50]How do I light the fireplace?
[275:03.85]Go talk to Lou.
[275:06.05]You know what's so funny about this?
[275:08.29]There are about 17,000 people here right now.
[275:11.32]I bet you at least 12,000 to 13,000 of you have the guide open.
[275:17.98]You have the game facts open.
[275:21.04]And you're all just sitting there going, how do I make sure he reads this?
[275:26.16]I think two or three thousand of you just gave up and like are making food right now.
[275:29.36]And you can probably hear me from across the room.
[275:31.54]Maybe you put me on the TV and you're like, you know what?
[275:34.22]He's not going to finish this in like the next 20 minutes.
[275:35.70]I'm going to make like a steak.
[275:37.06]And I'm probably talking to you right now.
[275:38.68]Hopefully the steak is good.
[275:39.78]Hopefully you cook it well.
[275:41.00]Well, not well done, but well enough for you to enjoy it.
[275:43.80]And then I think like a couple thousand of you just left.
[275:45.50]And they were like, I'm going to bed.
[275:48.08]So for all of the 12,000 of you that had the game fax open, I appreciate it.
[275:58.77]Okay.
[276:00.47]Now, we need to talk to Lou.
[276:06.40]One person has it open, 12,000 are just copy and pasting the one person's answers and changing one word to be sus.
[276:14.15]That's also true.
[276:16.14]You're right.
[276:17.34]A lot of you are not helping at all.
[276:18.98]You're copy and pasting the real answer and then adding like, and then you poo-poo all over and then you pee-pee and then it's like, okay, well, I read that one.
[276:26.53]I didn't, but you, no, I did read it.
[276:29.07]But I didn't say that I read it until right now.
[276:31.19]Lou, yeah?
[276:32.35]Well, good luck with the game.
[276:33.60]Been real.
[276:35.10]Moose, the moose, the moose, the moose, the moose.
[276:43.70]I can't.
[276:48.25]I already have the moose eye.
[276:50.51]Why don't I click on the moose?
[276:51.65]I already have it.
[276:57.41]How do I talk to Lou?
[277:06.15]Hello again.
[277:08.22]I'll see you two later, okay?
[277:09.60]I haven't served food in three days.
[277:11.86]What's up?
[277:13.24]Nice talking to you.
[277:14.48]Ditto, dude.
[277:18.46]I'm gonna sneeze, and I'm really sorry.
[277:20.88]Wait, I need to do this.
[277:35.19]Come on.
[277:37.37]I wanted so badly to get that.
[277:41.09]If it's back, I'll do it.
[277:42.95]Damn it.
[277:43.19]Shit.
[277:45.36]Shit.
[277:56.06]I want to click on this one.
[277:57.00]I can't even click on it.
[278:02.28]I can't click this one.
[278:03.22]Um...
[278:32.30]someone's talking about like element ring strategies things are not going well for streamer Jerma985 he's been having a little bit of trouble in Nancy Drew playthrough
[279:01.67]I do not have the bone yet.
[279:04.77]I can't open any- I'm gonna call this number.
[279:06.57]334-555-7625.
[279:11.18]What is this?
[279:27.65]You've reached the office of Dr. Nikki Sabatini, professor of geology at the University of Alberta, Camrose.
[279:32.93]The sound of the beep... No, no, disregard all that.
[279:35.53]I'm here.
[279:35.93]Who's this?
[279:37.27]My name is Nancy Drew.
[279:38.75]I'm staying at the Icicle Creek Lodge, and I recently came across some kind of device that had your phone number on it.
[279:47.07]Describe the device.
[279:48.59]Well, it has a spike on one end of it, and... Well, I'll be darned.
[279:53.45]Where did you say you found it?
[279:54.89]Well, actually, this, I mean, someone's dog was using it as a chew toy.
[279:59.94]She must have found it outside somewhere.
[280:02.14]You know what it is?
[280:03.34]It's a geophone.
[280:04.70]Someone stole a whole crate of them from me when I was out on Skookum Ridge not too long ago.
[280:08.78]Okay.
[280:12.94]What's a geophone?
[280:14.28]If you stick it in the ground, a geophone will detect seismic waves and turn them into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to a computer so they can be recorded and eventually interpreted.
[280:25.64]What have they said?
[280:27.18]Sounds like your frog detective voice.
[280:29.61]Okay.
[280:30.03]Okay.
[280:56.17]So I got to go take the radiation device there.
[281:00.70]When you say seismic waves, are you talking about earthquakes?
[281:04.22]In a way.
[281:04.94]You see, the seismic waves that geophones detect are man-made.
[281:09.16]You detonate something on the surface of the ground, and the concussion creates seismic waves which bounce off different geological features differently, depending on the impedance of the feature.
[281:18.63]The reflected waves are what the geophones detect and transmit.
[281:22.34]So to put the geophones to use, you need to blow things up?
[281:25.83]Correct.
[281:26.87]That's interesting.
[281:28.49]So if someone were looking for valuable mineral deposits, they might use geophones to do it?
[281:33.37]If someone had the technical expertise, yes.
[281:36.79]Although reflection seismology is more typically employed to locate deposits of hydrocarbons like oil and gas.
[281:43.77]What types of mineral deposits are likely to be found around the Icicle Creek drainage?
[281:48.09]All kinds of deposits.
[281:49.35]Silver, lead, uranium, molybdenum.
[281:52.51]I love saying that word.
[281:54.10]Molybdenum.
[281:55.36]I think that's why I became a geologist.
[281:57.60]Just so I'd have a reason to say molybdenum.
[282:00.96]Anyway, if you come across any more of my geophones or anything that would indicate who stole them, please, please, please let me know.
[282:08.28]What do you know about dinosaur bones?
[282:10.18]What do you know about dinosaur bones?
[282:11.28]That's not the one I wanted to click on.
[282:14.68]Oh, rare!
[282:41.36]Delete that part of the stream.
[282:42.22]Just don't watch.
[282:43.37]Rewind that and delete it out of your mind.
[282:44.57]I don't mind anyone bringing that up.
[282:58.85]Do you know what range of radiation is unsafe?
[283:01.45]Assuming the Geiger counter is measuring radiation in the environment and not in, say, a nuclear power plant, I wouldn't worry about it.
[283:09.94]When it comes to exposure to radiation, even the experts can't agree on what's safe and unsafe.
[283:15.02]And the fact is, you're exposed to radiation every single day.
[283:19.24]You can't avoid it.
[283:20.48]You absorb cosmic rays from space, ingest carbon-14 in food, inhale radon from the ground,
[283:30.09]What the heck?
[283:30.49]Alright.
[283:30.67]Alright.
[283:59.24]Alright.
[283:59.50]990.
[283:59.52]990 frequency.
[284:29.63]Alright, so, that's cool and all.
[284:42.71]So, can I turn the radio station?
[284:44.59]Or, this is 990, it's the radio?
[284:47.93]You sound sad.
[284:52.41]Yeah.
[284:54.75]I mean, I just wanted to
[284:59.72]You don't... How come I can't... Okay, turn it to nine.
[285:11.96]I don't know what this monster is.
[285:18.65]There's too many moving parts in this game.
[285:24.57]I have... Should I bring the stuff to get sniffed?
[285:32.53]Look at all this shit in my inventory.
[285:37.64]How do I get this open?
[286:00.95]I can't get it open.
[286:14.62]I need to talk to Lou.
[286:16.14]Every time I talk to Lou, he's sitting at that game and he just goes, talk to you later.
[286:19.20]A to B, B to C, C to D, D to E, E to G, G to, you know, X and then Y and Z. And you go, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[286:29.58]And if you don't, if you do, if you go from one to four, what's going on?
[286:32.62]Somebody's like radiated here.
[286:57.68]Just turn around.
[286:58.94]What's up?
[287:00.96]Nice talking to you.
[287:02.18]Ditto, dude.
[287:04.24]I can't talk to Lou.
[287:05.12]Lou doesn't do anything.
[287:05.88]Is it the bear?
[287:11.01]I don't know.
[287:15.19]What about the ram head?
[287:27.10]Okay.
[287:28.50]How do I get it?
[287:28.98]I need a ladder.
[288:12.11]I need a ladder.
[288:14.35]The door colors are wrong.
[288:15.69]Go check them.
[288:17.82]No, they're not.
[288:20.36]I wouldn't really get the raccoon one if that was the case.
[288:31.16]Why is there a radiation mechanic in a Nancy Drew game?
[288:33.68]Oh, this game is fucked.
[288:40.58]I need to turn the fire on.
[288:46.36]So I need to somehow get whatever... This is the pig head.
[288:49.33]I gotta get the fire to turn on.
[288:52.73]But I also have to get the ram one too.
[288:54.73]So I need a step ladder or something.
[288:56.31]Have I not beaten this game yet?
[289:03.53]I don't know.
[289:04.03]Because the game is fucking goofy.
[289:07.11]This is a goofy game.
[289:08.69]This is a wacky game.
[289:25.70]I could maybe go back and have the dog smell this.
[289:28.12]That's the only thing I can think of right now.
[289:29.58]I don't understand anything else.
[289:35.17]What the hell am I supposed to do?
[289:39.43]Let's just do that.
[289:55.77]Why'd you- you picked the hilarious difficulty.
[289:58.22]I didn't mean to.
[290:00.06]It was only- it was this or an- Easy.
[290:02.98]Let's see what the dog says about this stuff.
[290:12.79]Which I- I- have you left the stream in the last 20 minutes and you came back to check on us?
[290:16.49]The dog talks.
[290:18.09]That's kind of bizarre, by the way.
[290:20.44]So you missed that, which is very weird when it started talking.
[290:35.80]I mean, I don't think it should be, like, an Elmo voice.
[290:38.53]It was off-putting and weird when it was just, like, Elmo was, like, a high-pitched kind of Elmo voice.
[290:46.41]I'm surprised they actually decided to give it that kind of a voice.
[290:48.77]Alright.
[290:49.31]What do you think about this?
[290:50.66]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[291:06.41]Looks like it's not Yanni's.
[291:14.28]Negative for Bill Kessler.
[291:15.64]We got him.
[291:18.78]Good dog.
[291:20.50]Hey Lou!
[291:42.92]Got a bone to pick with you, Lou.
[291:47.66]Everybody laughed.
[291:49.03]We start sneaking with our jokes like that.
[292:14.09]I was gonna walk in with the notebook in my hand, holding it straight up.
[292:18.83]I could light a cigarette too, you know what I mean?
[292:23.00]Just walk right in the front door.
[292:24.06]Just be talking loudly about it.
[292:42.87]Nowhere would I be able to find the owner of this.
[292:47.34]Your notebook, I wonder.
[292:48.76]Ah, warm again.
[292:51.10]Now what?
[292:51.97]What is this?
[292:56.72]Lou Talbot, charged with trespassing, vandalism, and theft.
[293:01.46]I have a plan.
[293:04.40]Creating a piece of earthitecture inspired by Maverick artist Poppy Dada of keeping the dinosaur bones dug up in the process.
[293:15.18]Dinosaur bones?
[293:28.74]Hey, Lou.
[293:30.12]Can I get your hand with something in the kitchen?
[293:33.18]Oh, he's gone.
[293:42.55]Not time for kitchen duty yet.
[293:43.95]I feel like it hasn't been for days.
[293:57.11]Let me in here.
[294:02.13]That just hurt my fucking head.
[294:04.87]I did too many and it hurt.
[294:07.65]Why is that so loud?
[294:21.01]Okay, so now... Should I call somebody?
[294:29.99]I mean, I know that I need to talk to Lou, but Lou is not here.
[294:34.48]Do I just have to go to sleep?
[294:59.36]Can I get that ladder?
[295:00.10]When you make the scavenger hunt too hard, but the kids can't do it, and you just have to keep telling them where things are hidden.
[295:31.59]I should put on a coat before I go outside.
[295:32.77]Uncle Jeremy, I don't know where the egg is.
[295:35.69]Well, did you go up and press the face of the ox up in the bedroom?
[295:41.31]No.
[295:42.21]Well, after that, did you take the Geiger counter out of the wall and then find the radiated banana that I put under the sink?
[295:51.48]No.
[295:52.72]Well, I mean, and then after doing that, did you look down the third drain of the fourth toilet in the house?
[296:00.24]I just want to collect eggs.
[296:01.66]I don't want to do this.
[296:03.00]Well, you must be a dumb kid then.
[296:07.10]Let me show you where everything is.
[296:08.34]And I don't even fucking know.
[296:11.05]It's a banana.
[296:11.89]I like open up the banana, peel the banana.
[296:13.63]And then there's a code written on the peel.
[296:15.77]No, it's not.
[296:16.37]The code's not on this banana peel.
[296:18.75]No, I must have written that underneath the desk.
[296:21.65]I don't.
[296:23.39]It's not there either.
[296:24.44]I don't know where your eggs are.
[296:25.68]They're gone, kid.
[296:26.62]They're fucking out of here.
[296:27.50]They're gone.
[296:30.03]I ate all the eggs.
[296:31.05]I ate all the chocolate in them.
[296:35.18]That's what happened to him.
[296:37.90]Okay.
[296:40.70]I need to talk to Lou.
[296:42.49]I feel warmer already.
[296:43.95]I'm just going to fucking bed.
[297:04.29]Mr. Greens, are you alright?
[297:05.41]No, I can get out of here, I'm fine.
[297:07.40]Stupid Easter egg hunt anyways.
[297:14.42]When I was younger, we did money hunts.
[297:19.29]My father put six grand in a briefcase and he hid it, and me and all my siblings had to beat the shit out of each other in finding it.
[297:26.55]He hid it in one place.
[297:28.37]He gave us all different clues that were wrong.
[297:31.24]We had to come together and put our pieces of our clues together but it never worked out that way.
[297:35.21]We just beat the shit out of each other.
[297:38.93]I don't talk to any of my siblings anymore either.
[297:44.92]There he is.
[297:45.78]What's up?
[297:50.90]Can I have the Rex bone that you took from the plaque?
[297:53.76]Do you think I could have the Rex bone that you took from that plaque by the display case?
[297:58.71]Dude, what makes you think I took some bone from some plaque?
[298:03.58]Oh, get smart with me.
[298:08.48]Because you referred to it in your notebook, which I found outside in the snow.
[298:11.90]He's the loser.
[298:12.54]I'm fine.
[298:13.52]Someone who has a really good nose for such things is positive that it's yours.
[298:17.96]Alright, here's the deal.
[298:19.34]There's a lot of people out there who collect stuff like fossils and dinosaur bones, okay?
[298:23.71]They pay big bucks for them.
[298:25.73]And it just so happens paleontology is kind of my thing.
[298:28.33]This guy's drip is atrocious?
[298:29.75]I collect bones and I sell them.
[298:32.15]I disagree because this just reminds me of Scott Cyclops' drip, which is the blue with the yellow thing that goes across.
[298:39.56]That's Scott Cyclops' drip.
[298:41.98]I like this.
[298:42.74]Don't call this bad drip.
[298:44.63]It's the same outfit.
[298:48.96]So when you saw those stools over there, you recognized them to be dinosaur bones and decided to try to unearth more.
[298:55.05]Except I haven't unearthed anything.
[298:57.23]I'm not the one who's been making things go boom out there.
[299:00.27]I mean, I may have found a couple of good specimens in a couple of craters, but I didn't make the craters, and I don't know who did.
[299:06.90]There.
[299:07.54]That's the key to the closet in my room.
[299:09.54]You want the bone from that plaque?
[299:11.04]Go ahead and take it.
[299:12.92]Okay, dude.
[299:13.76]Excitement's over.
[299:15.26]Who's moving?
[299:21.37]That's awesome.
[299:22.47]Okay, dude.
[299:23.35]Got it.
[299:23.59]Okay, dude.
[299:51.04]Here's the one I'm looking for.
[299:52.28]Give me that.
[299:52.56]The Wex phone that's missing from that plaque.
[299:54.59]It is.
[299:55.11]Now let's go do it and solve the mystery.
[299:57.45]Did I call anybody?
[300:26.39]Crumpled paper under the desk?
[300:27.41]I think we already called that number.
[300:29.21]Never mind, I lost my phone.
[300:35.31]Can you call it for me?
[300:35.87]Yeah, yeah, give me a second.
[300:43.36]It's ringing.
[300:52.62]It's in the room somewhere.
[301:00.16]I can hear it somewhere in the house.
[301:02.04]Can you hear it?
[301:04.28]Check under the sofa.
[301:05.36]Like, just look under the bed.
[301:06.82]Yeah, it's somewhere in here.
[301:09.74]I don't know where your fucking phone is.
[301:25.54]Just sitting on it.
[301:26.30]I'm not sitting on it.
[301:27.14]I already looked.
[301:43.68]I still don't have the other coins, though.
[301:45.66]Maybe you don't need it.
[301:56.79]I'm not sitting on it.
[301:57.75]Do you want me to call it again to prove I'm not sitting on it?
[302:06.68]I'm calling you right now.
[302:07.30]I'm calling it again.
[302:10.52]I'll get my service.
[302:11.72]Hold on a second.
[302:30.33]That phone's fucked up.
[302:34.33]Alright, it's ringing.
[302:55.69]It's... I don't know where it is.
[302:56.57]It's not underneath me.
[303:02.17]Oh, shit.
[303:02.73]It's underneath me.
[303:03.24]I just sat up.
[303:04.82]Um... What do I do?
[303:07.66]What do you want me to do with this?
[303:11.78]I was sitting on it.
[303:12.87]Fuck.
[303:15.69]Alright, I gotta...
[303:21.10]That was weird.
[303:22.46]It was kind of muffled before I picked it up from under my ass.
[303:26.00]But I don't know.
[303:27.34]I just... I don't know what that was, but... That's pretty... I guess we just did that.
[303:39.43]That was fun.
[303:40.47]Oh, that just happened.
[303:41.19]Get me out of this fucking door.
[303:56.28]There it is.
[303:56.66]What?
[303:57.74]Oh, no.
[303:58.22]It's this shit again.
[303:59.00]It wants me to do all this weird shit.
[304:00.56]Can I change the difficulty right now?
[304:30.24]I gotta put all the coins in, don't I?
[304:31.78]Oh, no.
[304:35.15]Wait, what is it?
[304:35.81]Okay, wait.
[304:41.46]Um...
[305:02.08]Oh, I'm so close.
[305:29.07]No!
[305:29.95]No!
[306:08.41]having a tantrum um so there's an extra one here the question is how do I I gotta get rid of the extra one by putting it I don't know man like it's just some stupid ass puzzle
[306:44.93]I just don't know the order.
[306:46.75]It's just... I just don't know what order I need to do this in.
[306:50.63]I'm just so over this.
[306:52.51]I'm just over it.
[306:54.55]I would smash this thing with a fucking hammer until I got it.
[307:11.96]Well... How many are in this row?
[307:16.16]The order is beside it.
[307:18.56]I know it's fish, owl, bunny.
[307:21.18]But this one stupid ass duck is ruining everything for me.
[307:27.47]If only the answers were in a book.
[307:28.89]Yeah, I can't.
[307:29.39]I have to like leave this to open up the book.
[307:31.97]It wants me to do this first.
[307:34.51]And that's all fine and dandy.
[307:36.12]But how do I get rid of this stupid duck?
[307:45.80]I need to get the fish to be like the next thing coming down, like here.
[307:53.18]How do I get it out of order?
[307:58.66]Back on the bottom row.
[307:59.70]Because if I have to start moving shit around, I'm going to forget all this.
[308:10.13]It's going to get all messed up because I have to take so many coins out.
[308:14.54]Whatever, I'm just gonna fuck the whole thing up.
[308:19.90]I just don't... I don't know how to get to the solution I want to get to.
[308:27.37]Is that it?
[308:31.05]That's it.
[308:31.87]No, it's not.
[308:32.39]God damn it.
[308:38.10]Range two columns at a time.
[308:43.74]Uh...
[308:45.87]I'm playing this dumbass fucking children's game for five hours.
[308:50.07]Where am I going?
[308:50.59]Where's this one?
[308:51.03]Left?
[308:51.23]I didn't even know you could fucking do that.
[309:00.34]Are you kidding me?
[309:03.14]That doesn't help.
[309:12.42]Crazy how not hard this is.
[309:14.46]Well, it's not hard when you know exactly how to do it.
[309:17.72]I don't know how to do it, so it's not easy for me.
[309:20.96]It's hard for me, because I don't know what I have to do.
[309:39.26]I mean, I get it, but I'm running into a wall in my brain.
[309:43.38]That's why puzzles exist.
[309:46.03]Yeah.
[309:48.99]All these symbols and shapes and placement.
[309:52.57]I can sprint a hundred miles per hour in five seconds.
[309:57.35]You give me a ball, I can hit that fucking ball hard.
[310:00.19]I can do anything else but this.
[310:24.54]I need to reset it.
[310:29.36]The game won't even let me leave.
[310:30.90]It's like, no, dude, you're here.
[310:32.00]You're stuck here.
[310:38.99]Yeah, I know what it's supposed to look like.
[310:40.49]It's supposed to be fish, owl, bunny.
[310:42.69]I'm about to just let you guys do it while I watch fucking Spongebob on another monitor.
[311:11.41]Let me see if I can get it.
[311:12.19]Let me try one more time.
[311:15.99]So bunny bunny fish fit.
[311:17.43]It's just like, it's like knocking shit down.
[311:19.94]I just hate looking at this.
[311:25.52]Does anybody get that way where you look at just a shitload of symbols and you just can't anymore?
[311:30.80]They all just meld together into one picture.
[311:34.94]Like this is all melding into one image.
[311:42.18]It's all the same picture.
[311:43.00]It's all literally the same photo.
[311:44.90]I can't move them around.
[311:46.36]They're stuck here.
[311:49.00]Maybe Dave can help?
[311:49.66]I almost feel like I want two coins at the same time.
[312:11.24]But I can't
[312:13.22]I can't get that.
[312:24.19]He's going to end the stream.
[312:25.63]I'm not going to end the stream.
[312:30.35]It's like a slide.
[312:30.85]Yeah, it's all the slider puzzle dog shit.
[312:33.64]Alright.
[312:34.02]Slider puzzles are.
[312:36.56]I promised you I wasn't going to get angry today.
[312:40.32]slider puzzle oh god no I can't do a slider puzzle oh no you know when we were younger we didn't do slider puzzles we went down the slip and slide of on rocks yeah none of this smooth grass okay let me look at this again
[313:09.56]Reset the whole thing.
[313:10.96]So, I can rearrange these by continuing to drop the tile that falls out the bottom into one of the columns at the top.
[313:17.85]I know how it works, Nancy.
[313:18.55]The question is, how should I rearrange them?
[313:21.09]Match the symbols and line them up in rows of three, maybe?
[313:23.89]Nancy, hold on.
[313:30.44]I'm collecting out of the window.
[313:37.47]You want the bunny on top.
[313:38.91]Yeah, you need the bunny on top.
[313:43.83]Always keep the animal tokens next to each other.
[313:46.76]That's the theory.
[313:47.44]Oh, I've got wicked bad diarrhea right now.
[313:54.46]I'm just... Oh, I'm sorry.
[313:57.92]My stomach is like, fucking... I've got wicked bad diarrhea right now.
[314:01.05]What the fuck?
[314:07.15]Alright.
[314:07.43]Yep.
[314:12.23]I think it passed.
[314:12.77]I think I've heard it.
[314:13.37]Yeah, I think I'm good.
[314:15.56]You know.
[314:18.68]Just get a good look at this.
[314:20.62]Alright.
[314:20.84]The duck definitely has to go.
[314:22.10]If it were me doing this, I would probably put the duck second row or the first row, I think.
[314:31.45]Now that can go to the right side because you want to make sure that that's in the middle now.
[314:35.51]And then that goes on the left side for me.
[314:36.87]I would put this in the middle.
[314:38.59]And this is going to go up here.
[314:40.73]And then on the left again, I think.
[314:42.39]And then probably back up.
[314:43.51]I would say probably on the left side.
[314:46.43]And left again.
[314:47.01]And then maybe on the right.
[314:49.63]No, I would say probably the middle.
[314:54.91]I think that's correct.
[314:57.10]Maybe...
[314:59.80]On the right, left side.
[315:00.78]And then the right side.
[315:01.76]And then the left side again.
[315:04.18]The walkthrough is different now.
[315:06.52]How?
[315:08.10]How would you fucking do this shit?
[315:10.32]Look at all this.
[315:10.93]Look at this mess.
[315:12.87]This is a fucking mess.
[315:14.53]I'm cheating.
[315:14.93]I don't even care.
[315:15.63]I'm literally cheating right now.
[315:19.05]I hate these.
[315:20.19]All these games that have just slider puzzle after slider puzzle.
[315:23.04]I would, I would, no.
[315:24.36]Just give me anything else besides this.
[315:28.33]I can't even follow the guide.
[315:29.27]It's happening so fast.
[315:35.46]I'd rather eat my own hand than do a slider puzzle.
[315:50.57]Okay, this goes here.
[315:51.59]I don't care.
[315:53.75]This is my least favorite way to play a video game, is these kinds of puzzles.
[316:02.33]The game just crashed.
[316:06.08]Stop fucking with me.
[316:08.50]And I lost my place in the video.
[316:16.88]Slider puzzles.
[316:23.60]Okay.
[316:24.20]Goose goes first.
[316:27.66]And then that goes on the right side.
[316:32.04]That mine is different than the walkthrough.
[316:34.62]What?
[316:36.02]What's going on?
[316:38.67]Is it random?
[316:40.05]The walkthrough is going too fast.
[316:59.45]This is not, this is, I put, why did I put this on hard?
[317:01.34]What was I doing?
[317:02.28]It's Nancy Drew.
[317:02.78]Do I really care?
[317:03.38]Yeah.
[317:03.64]Maybe if I was in bed with my iPad, I wouldn't care, I would be doing this.
[317:06.54]But I'm, we're not in bed, I'm not on my, I mean, we're not in bed.
[317:08.62]We're not doing that.
[317:35.61]No, it baited me.
[317:37.57]It actually baited me.
[317:38.70]This is not supposed to go here.
[317:39.86]They hovered over here and it was like, oh, go.
[317:42.58]No, and then they moved.
[317:43.58]What the fuck?
[317:51.99]Jesus Christ, man.
[318:08.13]I know how it works.
[318:09.08]Stop talking.
[318:09.78]I'm gonna laugh if this walkthrough takes a wicked long time to do this.
[318:36.55]That was the one that... Okay, that was... Don't... I gotta... Okay, right here.
[318:39.07]They're stalling.
[319:02.13]I don't think they know where to go.
[319:03.89]Yeah, they do.
[320:05.97]How long does this take to do this?
[320:07.73]I hope I'm doing this right because this is long, man.
[320:33.09]This is a long time.
[321:26.11]Imagine if I did this and it was just like a fuck you Jerma at the end and this wasn't doing anything.
[321:32.36]I feel like that could happen.
[321:47.93]Shit, come on man.
[321:49.37]Come on, it has to be getting close.
[321:51.65]It has to be, right?
[321:58.21]I'm gonna miss a step.
[321:59.25]Just pay attention.
[322:00.66]Why does my back hurt?
[322:28.92]This is not ending.
[322:30.34]How much longer?
[322:32.12]When do I get to leave this?
[322:40.05]Okay, I think it's close.
[322:43.29]I don't know.
[322:45.01]I'm just following what it's doing.
[322:46.59]I'm just following the walkthrough.
[323:03.82]I'm following the walkthrough, I promise.
[323:11.84]Oh, Ted!
[323:12.18]I got it!
[323:15.09]Bingo.
[323:16.15]Alright.
[323:20.01]Bingo.
[323:31.71]Mmm, scary.
[323:36.91]Hmm.
[323:39.86]Little creepy.
[323:49.40]Looks like the map to some kind of maze.
[323:54.03]Jesus Christ.
[324:13.83]Where am I right now?
[324:17.35]I'm taking a picture of this.
[324:20.69]No human does this without a fucking photo.
[324:30.92]Where am I right now?
[324:31.88]Here?
[324:32.08]Or here?
[324:34.58]Do I know where I am?
[324:35.44]The wolf followed me.
[324:36.80]I wonder if she expects me to do something.
[324:42.10]um what I want you to go I want you to go I don't know what what I don't know even what direction I'm even facing what direction are we looking around isis around this map is meaningless unless I know what direction I'm looking
[325:20.96]What are even the dog doesn't want to do this the dog doesn't want to do this either Alright, so let's just let forward around Around forward forward forward.
[325:33.94]Let's just see what happens Isis around forward forward forward forward forward go
[325:45.61]I just wanna know what I'm even looking at.
[325:52.17]Forward, forward, forward.
[325:54.30]Um... Forward, forward... Hold on.
[325:57.28]Forward, forward four times, and then... Right?
[326:00.44]Right?
[326:12.87]I don't... how many commands can I even queue up?
[326:16.89]Your dog is a rudimentary computer, bro.
[326:38.80]Looks like some kind of gate is in her way.
[326:41.30]I did forward four times.
[326:42.58]One, two, three, four.
[326:43.92]There are four dots.
[326:47.07]What are you talking about?
[326:54.61]Forward.
[326:55.43]Forward.
[326:55.97]Forward.
[326:57.41]Right.
[326:58.31]Right.
[326:58.67]Right.
[326:59.07]Right.
[327:00.21]I'm going to stop here.
[327:01.35]Isis.
[327:02.07]Forward.
[327:02.85]Forward.
[327:03.61]Forward.
[327:04.49]Right.
[327:05.29]Right.
[327:06.09]Right.
[327:06.77]Go.
[327:13.35]You start on the first one.
[327:18.05]Forward.
[327:19.05]Forward.
[327:19.97]Forward.
[327:20.93]Right.
[327:22.05]This dog is not doing the correct thing.
[327:31.47]Is it... Will it go until it hits a wall?
[327:39.05]Forward one.
[327:41.64]Then right?
[327:43.82]Left?
[327:46.30]Left.
[327:48.34]Forward, right, left, right.
[327:52.95]Forward, right.
[327:56.39]Okay, well there is... I can't go past the gates.
[327:59.47]I have to get to the... Jump over the gate.
[328:06.96]Okay, what if... Forward jump?
[328:09.72]Forward.
[328:11.22]Jump?
[328:12.02]Jump.
[328:13.54]Let's just see what that does.
[328:14.44]Isis, forward, jump, go.
[328:18.13]You started the first dot.
[328:19.11]Yeah, well then, why did the dog go five dots?
[328:22.45]I said three forwards, not five.
[328:26.35]I said forward once here.
[328:28.65]Okay, you just go until you hit something.
[328:32.88]Can somebody please explain to me what on Earth is going on right now?
[328:44.80]Is it four circles is one forward?
[328:49.68]So would it be forward, forward, jump?
[328:52.57]Forward, jump.
[328:54.59]ISIS.
[328:55.03]I don't even know what this is doing.
[328:56.11]Forward, forward, jump, go.
[328:58.25]Every intersection is a command.
[329:06.91]Will I end up in the whatever this is in the middle here?
[329:12.94]Looks like some kind of gate is in her way.
[329:15.18]Forward.
[329:18.34]Right.
[329:29.81]Forward.
[329:30.25]Right.
[329:30.53]Does that actually work though?
[329:32.65]I feel like this is not working.
[329:33.83]Forward.
[329:34.73]Right.
[329:35.39]Go.
[329:46.58]forward right okay forward right forward jump over the hole and then pop forward right left right jump what about under the gate down
[330:17.69]Each command is an obstacle.
[330:19.09]Forward, right, left, right, jump.
[330:21.23]Forward, left, right, left, jump.
[330:24.45]ISIS.
[330:25.19]Forward, left, right, left, jump.
[330:29.11]Go.
[330:31.03]Why'd you just do left?
[330:31.83]Somebody said it.
[330:34.30]Right, left, not right.
[330:36.54]Chat is moving so fast.
[330:37.70]I'm sorry.
[330:38.06]I got the one guy that gave me the fucking bogus directions.
[330:44.94]Looks like some kind of gate is in her way.
[330:49.37]I can't even take it anymore.
[330:57.52]Forward, right, left, right, jump, go.
[330:59.88]Forward, right, left, right, jump, go.
[331:04.64]We're losing respect for you?
[331:08.07]I don't think you are.
[331:09.13]I think everyone can look at this and go, this is kind of fucking cheesy.
[331:12.71]This is cheesy.
[331:13.91]This is like a stinky cheese.
[331:25.73]My respect for you went up, actually.
[331:29.05]Yeah, thanks.
[331:34.32]Now what?
[331:36.84]Do we just... What did we just do to the dog?
[331:41.98]What happened to the dog?
[331:43.58]Oh, no.
[331:45.76]We beamed him up into outer space.
[331:47.64]Uh...
[331:55.14]Oh, now what?
[332:01.99]Okay, that was just Liam Neeson jumping over a fence with 12 cuts.
[332:05.41]I could have just walked up that easily, right?
[332:07.85]Like, we didn't have... Now where am I going?
[332:33.08]A moose, a wolf, a raccoon and a pig.
[332:36.36]The same animals Trapper Dan mentioned in his journal when it came to getting into his needle without the key.
[332:42.29]I'll bet that's what's behind this wall.
[332:44.59]A room below the needle.
[332:46.39]Next thing I have to do is get each of these panels open.
[332:52.13]What?
[332:56.08]Bro, what is this game?
[332:59.74]I have to get all the panels open?
[333:03.17]Where's the dog?
[333:03.79]I only have two coins.
[333:22.45]Okay, what about right?
[333:35.46]Oh, hi.
[333:38.78]Uh... Good job!
[333:55.07]I think?
[334:02.43]And then...
[334:09.24]No nine-year-olds beating this game.
[334:10.98]A nine-year-old's going to cry.
[334:11.92]They're going to get to a point where they're going to be crying because it's just... A nine-year-old will cry.
[334:15.34]No way.
[334:16.02]Should have picked the child.
[334:22.43]Should have picked the children fucking difficulty.
[334:31.04]Okay, I need to obviously flip up all these switches and have all four of the infinity stones.
[334:38.17]I need to get all of the stones and then come back here again and then do all this bullshit again.
[334:59.04]I mean, that's what I have to do.
[335:00.22]That's what I have to do.
[335:01.34]I have to... I can't do this.
[335:25.30]This is a punishment.
[335:28.63]kind of is okay there's four switches in the tunnel yeah but I'm gonna need the four the horsemen of the apocalypse I need the other two coins uh-oh it's too late to walk back to the lodge now I better spend the night here
[335:53.03]When you make the dog pull the rope, you're on a timer.
[335:55.09]You have to run back to the lodge and get the pig token and the pig head.
[335:58.89]Is that accurate?
[335:59.65]Because if it is, I cannot understand how that would be a thing.
[336:03.20]That's not accurate.
[336:15.87]Oh, that can't be right.
[336:20.49]The timer is reset now.
[336:29.11]Do I actually have to do this again?
[336:37.49]A whole day went by, I slept in the shack!
[336:42.35]Is the timer reset?
[336:59.76]No way.
[337:01.12]You have to beat the guy at that coyote game three times now.
[337:09.30]What?
[337:12.81]No, I don't.
[337:13.41]I'm making it up.
[337:15.29]God damn it.
[337:33.19]Nancy, what is going on?
[337:40.14]Nancy, what is going on with this one?
[337:49.50]Why is there a sleep mechanic in the game?
[337:51.57]You know what I mean?
[337:52.09]Why is there like, go to bed and reset stuff.
[337:54.63]Why do I have to do people's laundry?
[338:03.02]What's going on in this game?
[338:25.92]I'm not even here.
[338:26.52]I'm about to watch the rest of this on YouTube.
[338:29.88]And by this, I mean, like, just, like, what happens at the end.
[338:32.18]Oh, my God.
[338:32.64]I don't...
[338:59.12]Stop being a negative, Nancy.
[339:03.30]I can't believe I actually have to go back to the door.
[339:05.55]Chantal's counting on me to get those rooms cleaned.
[339:07.97]I should go do that.
[339:09.63]Why is there a clean the rooms mechanic?
[339:14.89]Why?
[339:16.09]Nobody wants to do what I'm doing right now.
[339:19.27]I want to solve the fucking murder mystery.
[339:22.68]Why is there a go up and clean the room mechanic?
[339:25.52]What is this for?
[339:36.47]I don't care.
[339:37.57]Fuck off.
[339:38.43]I don't care.
[339:38.93]Oh, close it.
[339:39.57]I'm not going to even go over there.
[339:40.77]My jacket.
[339:41.93]I'm getting a definite feeling I'm not wanted here.
[339:53.82]My jacket.
[339:56.42]Okay.
[339:59.16]I know who did it.
[340:00.54]We've done this for like an hour and a half.
[340:10.04]Is every room done or what?
[340:13.39]I think I'm good.
[340:13.97]I need not just leave.
[340:14.69]I don't get call me again.
[340:17.47]Why she not wearing the jacket?
[340:18.39]Yeah.
[340:18.57]Like do I actually have to have the dog pull that and run back here?
[340:24.27]I really hope that's not bait.
[340:26.05]I can't go anywhere.
[340:27.19]I still haven't cleaned all those rooms.
[340:30.49]God, oh my God.
[340:38.43]Do I have to actually do the laundry too?
[340:42.50]This late in the game, you're gonna make me do the fucking laundry?
[340:45.82]I'm pissed right now.
[340:48.04]We're like moments away from solving the mystery.
[340:50.98]But make sure you go clean the rooms and shit.
[340:54.32]What?
[340:55.32]Let me finish the game.
[340:56.18]I don't want to cook lunch and go clean.
[341:03.14]Why?
[341:04.36]What on Earth do I have to do this?
[341:23.37]Oh my... I'm livid right now.
[341:38.95]And I click too fast and the game operates on six screens in this hallway.
[341:52.90]I don't even know if I'm getting it all.
[341:54.04]I'm just trying to rush because this is a crap.
[341:57.40]This is a crap part of the game and we all know it.
[342:05.56]Why am I like reviewing this old Nancy Drew game from 2007 like it came out last night?
[342:15.21]I don't know and I don't care.
[342:22.96]Get me the fuck out of here
[342:53.81]The pig head thing is not bait.
[342:55.57]My wife plays these games and is very upset.
[342:57.47]Also, the wolf token is in the basement.
[343:02.55]I really actually have to do that?
[343:22.05]Wait, you should back down here.
[343:31.45]What is... What's happening right now?
[343:33.55]Okay.
[343:33.95]Okay, I was gonna say, I'm not dead.
[343:34.93]I don't have to do that again, right?
[343:54.64]What the fuck, man?
[343:55.88]Okay.
[343:56.02]We need to have him do all the levers, so let's just get it over with.
[344:03.58]So with that being said, we need to do all the levers.
[344:07.26]We need to get it over with.
[344:14.75]Apologize to his wife.
[344:16.29]Why?
[344:16.59]Because I said this game sucks?
[344:18.33]I'm sorry.
[344:24.58]I'm sorry.
[344:27.98]I'm kidding.
[344:28.98]I'm kidding.
[344:29.58]I'm kidding.
[344:30.08]I'm kidding.
[344:30.82]Relax.
[344:31.44]It's a joke.
[344:37.42]I could never say that about the Drew crew and Nancy Drew.
[344:40.01]Come on.
[344:42.67]I've just eaten at least three pieces of this chapstick in frustration of the last hour and 25 minutes.
[344:50.44]I would never say something like that about the Drew crew.
[344:53.78]Speaking of the Drew crew, if they could give me a quick hand here.
[344:56.92]Just give me the exact combination to do all this.
[345:05.52]Speaking directly to the Dru crew right now.
[345:07.18]Just give me the exact combination.
[345:10.24]We all know I don't want to do this.
[345:12.10]We know you don't want to do it either, but one of us has to.
[345:14.80]One of us has to.
[345:16.53]And we all know it ain't gonna be me.
[345:19.13]I'm busy looking directly into the center of the screen and not moving my arms.
[345:23.93]Nobody else do it.
[345:28.43]Show us the map.
[345:30.29]Hold on.
[345:32.15]I can't alt-tab this game either.
[345:33.63]That's the problem.
[345:35.53]Wait, here's the combination.
[345:36.45]Oh shit, somebody actually has it.
[345:39.77]I can't even bark.
[345:50.66]It's so easy.
[345:51.42]This really isn't.
[345:52.86]It's easy if you like, I've checked out.
[345:55.89]I clocked out like 30, 40 minutes ago.
[345:57.63]I'm not kidding.
[345:58.07]Okay.
[345:59.49]Like, it would be easy if I, like, looked at this map and was like, oh, like, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[346:05.15]I checked out.
[346:06.07]I checked out, like, 30 minutes ago.
[346:11.53]They took bark off this, too, which I wouldn't you check out as well?
[346:24.10]I fucked up my shower.
[346:25.31]You should have called somebody.
[346:28.99]Okay, forward.
[346:29.65]Let's see if this works.
[346:31.82]Forward, left, left, paw.
[346:39.43]Forward, left, left, paw.
[346:41.47]Isis, forward, left, left, paw, go.
[347:01.16]looks like some kind of gate is in her way that's not right forward right left right jump and then I have to run out do I have to probably do I have to do something else to get those bars to move
[347:27.86]What was it?
[347:28.22]Forward, right, left.
[347:28.98]Forward, right, left, right.
[347:31.68]What was it?
[347:32.00]Forward, right, left, right.
[347:34.19]Jump.
[347:35.43]Jump.
[347:36.05]Isis.
[347:36.65]Then I have to run out of here.
[347:37.55]Forward, right, left, right.
[347:39.98]Jump.
[347:40.72]Go.
[347:50.06]You open the red gates, you need to win the Fox game on those three sides.
[347:55.55]This game was not for kids.
[347:58.37]It wasn't.
[347:58.99]There's no way it was.
[348:11.93]I played it as a kid.
[348:12.95]Yeah, and we all know you gave up after the first explosion.
[348:17.24]You were like, whoa!
[348:18.14]Alright, I'm doing something else.
[348:23.19]Okay, pull it.
[348:26.49]Now run!
[348:26.81]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
[348:46.72]Go, go, go, go, go!
[348:47.46]Hurry, hurry!
[348:51.15]Mom's never going to let him play Diablo.
[348:53.11]I think I'm conceding that I'm not going to be playing Diablo tonight because this is the whole stream.
[349:03.78]It was fun, though.
[349:05.44]I had fun.
[349:05.82]I hope you guys had fun.
[349:09.36]It's been a great time.
[349:10.04]As frustrated as I've been at some of this.
[349:13.99]Slide puzzles.
[349:17.03]Slide puzzles get you.
[349:18.41]They really do.
[349:22.53]No, I'm having fun.
[349:28.36]Everyone at the beginning of 2020.
[349:30.60]I can handle anything.
[349:31.38]2020, never mind.
[349:33.38]Is it just me or has 2020 felt like one long game of fox and geese?
[349:40.28]That's from the official Nancy Drew account?
[349:53.12]That's the official Nancy Drew account said that.
[349:58.81]They made their game harder than Dark Souls.
[350:02.89]And Dark Souls wasn't even out yet.
[350:04.51]So, they were the original Dark Souls.
[350:08.07]Okay.
[350:08.75]Oh, no.
[350:14.74]Go, go, go.
[350:15.38]Don't stop and talk to Chad for a second.
[350:19.98]Got it.
[350:35.89]Huh?
[350:36.59]Oh.
[350:37.55]I need to play.
[350:38.31]Well, sorry to bother you.
[350:39.97]Hasta siesta.
[350:42.01]Don't we play this?
[350:45.88]Now go into the basement.
[350:54.08]Okay, what's going on in the basement?
[350:56.88]Lutel's gone, in case you didn't know.
[350:59.05]Just up and left.
[351:01.17]Thank God.
[351:01.67]Oh no.
[351:40.31]Let's see.
[351:40.83]Do I really want to go outside without a coat?
[351:43.87]I don't think so.
[351:46.85]I can't go outside, not without a coat.
[351:49.25]It's too cold.
[351:51.03]Let's see.
[351:51.56]Do I really want to go outside without a coat?
[351:53.68]What do I do about that?
[352:04.86]What's radioactive right here?
[352:12.17]I need a coat.
[352:13.95]Didn't I... I didn't click on it?
[352:15.03]I had... Do I actually have to get my coat on?
[352:21.78]I clicked on it.
[352:22.82]There was a note on it, but I didn't pick it back up.
[352:24.64]I thought I did.
[352:25.16]Where's my coat?
[352:34.61]This isn't even my room.
[352:38.03]This is my room.
[352:38.77]Where's my coat?
[353:10.96]There's a reading here.
[353:12.32]Yeah, it's this thing right here. 13...
[353:31.79]See the reading at the bottom left, yeah?
[353:33.23]Go down to the main floor, go right, and go left side of the kitchen door.
[353:35.99]There's a high reading by the dinosaur bone stool decor.
[353:39.91]Uh-huh.
[353:41.51]Go down to the basement.
[353:44.80]Go forward after the- get another high reading.
[353:46.34]After the stairs and the cellar door, face the stairs and get the highest reading.
[353:56.22]Wasn't I just- I was just- I was just standing there.
[354:05.33]Do I have to get a reading from everything that needs to be read before I can do that?
[354:11.90]Click the bottom stair.
[354:18.55]What in the... Okay.
[354:23.97]Do I have them all now?
[354:24.85]I didn't know.
[354:29.80]1, 2, 3, 4.
[354:31.42]I got them all.
[354:33.41]Alright.
[354:35.39]We're almost there.
[354:37.29]We're almost there.
[354:40.79]I have to beat this guy three times.
[354:42.77]This is going to be a nightmare.
[354:45.85]I'm just going to click on random places until I get it.
[354:47.41]I'll put up a Family Guy clip compilation or something in the corner if I can't do it.
[354:54.77]Please just leave me alone.
[354:56.43]I'm trying to literally walk up the stairs, but I have to walk in a full circle to go up the stairs.
[355:11.11]No, I have to go to... I have to go... I have to sleep cycle.
[355:13.39]Go to bed and wake up and play the guy.
[355:28.54]It's too early.
[355:29.10]Go back to bed.
[355:47.85]I wish I could just click on the room.
[355:57.15]Where is this guy?
[356:01.67]Where is this?
[356:02.51]Why would he never be here?
[356:03.81]Why would there be a code, a line of code where he wouldn't be sitting here?
[356:07.77]It's 3 p.m.
[356:29.40]Go back to the mines.
[356:33.26]Back to the mines.
[357:03.96]I have all the tokens, but all... I can't... I need to open the gates.
[357:08.92]The red gates.
[357:13.05]If I don't have the red gates open, I can't do anything.
[357:14.91]So how do I get the red gates open?
[357:17.85]Play this guy three times.
[357:19.82]But he's not even here.
[357:20.56]Do I have to go to bed until he comes back?
[357:32.17]You don't have to.
[357:32.85]Oh my god, you don't have to.
[357:33.93]Alright, well then I'm... Alright, I'm going.
[357:41.59]Got all the coins, so... You have to play the game.
[357:53.68]Well, they didn't code him in to be there.
[357:57.24]He's not there.
[357:58.23]Wear my shoes.
[358:32.45]You should play something else.
[358:34.55]I feel like we're in way too deep and we were in way too deep after I said I would play this today.
[358:47.11]I haven't completed a Nancy Drew game in two or three years.
[359:02.78]The lanterns in here are basically just rocks hung in cages.
[359:06.19]I wonder what makes the rocks glow like that.
[359:09.25]I don't know, but I wouldn't be breathing in that deeply because it's like apparently like it's radiation.
[359:40.54]Okay.
[359:41.84]I'm glad I just came all the way to do that.
[360:08.44]You actually have to beat him three more times.
[360:16.92]why is he not just sitting there if that if that is like a core thing you have to do to beat the game why would he how would anybody he needs to be sitting there at the table ready to play not not there not sleeping he needs to be sitting at the table
[361:04.53]You gotta get out of here or the uranium is getting to your brain.
[361:09.09]Alright, let's go back and play- I can't believe I have to play this game three more times.
[362:02.37]They need to bury these games in a fucking landfill like they did E.T.
[362:06.41]Ah, warm again.
[362:07.67]Huh?
[362:17.96]How about another game of Fox and Geese?
[362:19.84]How about another game of Fox and Geese?
[362:22.40]Now you're talking.
[362:23.68]Have a seat.
[362:24.63]Ready?
[362:27.82]I don't mind if we use this little pig I found.
[362:29.67]Would you mind if we use this little pig I found in place of the fox piece?
[362:33.65]Fine by me.
[362:37.83]And now what?
[362:38.95]Now what do I have to do?
[362:40.01]I have to corner... I have to... I have to... In different directions?
[362:46.76]Herd the pig.
[362:49.60]By surrounding with the geese squares.
[362:55.59]Good luck.
[362:57.47]But is this just the same game or is it different somehow?
[363:12.78]Do I have to corner him in this corner over here?
[363:19.84]You've got to be shitting me.
[363:40.28]You're gonna be shitting me.
[363:41.98]There's no way this is... I actually... You have to do this.
[363:48.13]Alright, I'm gonna move him over to the raccoon.
[363:53.81]And... I guess this won't be that bad.
[364:00.19]It's gonna be bad to do the pig, though.
[364:05.01]Put him in the pig corner.
[364:13.75]This sucks, okay.
[364:16.77]Oh my god, you know what?
[364:18.77]You know what?
[364:19.29]I'm about to pull the plug on this.
[364:29.97]This is- this sucks.
[364:40.93]Okay, we start over?
[364:52.13]I have an ad, hold on.
[365:01.69]Okay.
[365:07.78]Give me ten minutes.
[365:17.77]This looks so, so fucking annoying.
[365:20.77]Okay, this sucks.
[365:23.79]I'm gonna take my physical therapy forever.
[365:25.40]No, Family Guy has brought to you in part by that commercial you just saw.
[365:47.19]Why did they pad Nancy Drew to be like a 9 to 10 hour game?
[365:53.91]Like, they got to the end here, and instead of just ending the game, they put like a 2 hour padding on it.
[366:01.34]Why?
[366:01.62]Why is there at least a 45 minute to an hour padding on the final part of the game?
[366:10.46]I don't remember the other Nancy Drew games doing this.
[366:17.51]You know what?
[366:18.27]I'm not- I don't care about a guide.
[366:19.57]We're doing it my way.
[368:53.30]I was right there!
[368:54.25]Get me!
[371:01.82]Shit.
[371:03.53]Is the mic off?
[371:04.21]No, I'm just really trying to focus.
[371:06.47]Because I don't want to lose this because I almost got him up there.
[371:33.15]goes here.
[371:43.82]Nobody knows what you're doing.
[371:44.64]Yeah, they do.
[371:46.34]I'm trying to trap the pig up here.
[371:48.54]I'm kind of, this one maybe, just to get it in here.
[372:04.33]No, no, no.
[372:05.31]Back.
[372:05.59]Move it back.
[372:20.34]Got him.
[372:22.17]Got him!
[372:23.71]I got him.
[372:24.07]I got him.
[372:24.37]I got him.
[372:24.73]Alright, he ain't going anywhere.
[372:25.53]I got him.
[372:47.56]so then this is go in the middle it can't get me from anywhere in the middle I will be able to go up when he does now I'm not getting cocky because he's probably gonna go he's probably gonna go down and then I'm gonna move the one that's left up alright that's that's still good for us
[373:08.80]We can trap him here.
[373:09.71]That's better for us.
[373:14.23]We're good.
[373:40.08]I fucked it up.
[373:42.48]I fucked it up.
[373:43.84]I ruined everything.
[373:45.56]I ruined it, didn't I?
[373:46.15]I fucked it up.
[373:58.93]I fucked it up.
[374:05.81]I'm good.
[374:06.15]No, I'm good.
[374:11.72]I got him.
[374:12.06]I win.
[374:12.28]Again.
[374:14.36]But this time, I want to use a different one.
[374:17.46]Okay.
[374:39.63]I want to replace my... Wait, do I want to... Do I have to use a different coin?
[374:51.66]Why can I not use a different coin?
[374:56.24]It's just the pig pile you used.
[374:59.66]Oh, I thought it was like pig went up there, raccoon, coin... Okay, so it doesn't matter.
[375:05.47]Alright, well, let's just... Let's even get him over here.
[375:54.07]What the fuck did I do that for?
[376:23.58]What the f- No, no, no, no, no, no.
[376:25.60]Stay over there.
[376:26.36]Stay over there.
[376:27.30]We're good.
[376:28.14]Stay over there.
[376:30.14]I just won.
[376:31.02]I just beat him.
[376:31.50]Did I just beat him?
[376:37.84]Hold on.
[376:38.04]He's over here.
[376:38.70]Wait.
[376:38.94]Hold on.
[376:39.22]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[376:47.59]God damn it.
[376:48.69]He can get out.
[376:53.80]I can't block him.
[377:03.71]You went in three moves?
[377:04.83]I don't know what those moves are.
[377:07.13]I know I can, but give me a hand here.
[377:09.48]I don't want to fuck around.
[377:17.46]The one in the middle is what I want to do.
[377:19.95]Yep.
[377:32.04]Okay.
[377:41.22]Okay, so where do I go?
[377:47.29]Middle one?
[377:51.57]Middle, down, left, right?
[378:05.89]Uh, middle diagonal left.
[378:17.96]Alright.
[378:18.38]So, uh, I, this thing's dead.
[378:22.00]I can't move anything here.
[378:25.10]This is, he's going to get out.
[378:31.23]Move it back.
[378:34.78]Nah, he's going to get out.
[378:40.85]I guess I'm going to try to do what I was doing before and just get him over here.
[379:08.95]Okay, now get out of here.
[379:12.97]There we go.
[379:13.31]Okay.
[379:13.71]Okay.
[379:32.03]Goddammit.
[379:43.06]I'm in such a bad position, though, to try to get him to... I'm just gonna start moving shit, like I have to.
[379:49.82]Okay.
[380:09.97]Move forward this one.
[380:16.22]Good.
[380:21.37]Don't go that way.
[380:24.23]Do not go that way, please.
[380:27.19]Thank you.
[380:59.07]That's fine.
[382:07.44]This dude can't be fucking sick.
[382:09.30]Yes, dude, I, alright, for those of you that don't know, I have to get him in each one of these stupid-ass slots.
[382:15.94]They tweeted about this.
[382:17.42]This was a meme to their development team.
[382:19.60]They even said, wow, this is like, well, it really was fucking, wow, this was something, wasn't it?
[382:23.67]They are, they did that.
[382:27.67]The game devs already told you that this was a long-ass, stupid-ass part of the game, okay?
[382:33.43]Okay?
[382:36.86]I'm just participating.
[382:42.11]I don't know.
[382:42.75]Hold on.
[382:43.43]It needs to go back up.
[382:49.34]Actually kind of good, I think.
[382:50.22]I can't go that way.
[383:10.41]Get up here.
[383:18.03]Fill the edges.
[383:18.71]Yeah, but he only moves in two, he won't go up there.
[383:26.71]See, like get the, stop going.
[383:28.44]He goes back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.
[383:30.32]Just go up here and try to kill something.
[383:37.28]Because if I put this down here, he's going to go up here and then he's going to go bonk, bonk, bonk.
[384:23.79]Don't do it.
[384:24.71]He's gonna go down here and he's gonna jump me.
[384:28.45]If I go right here, he's gonna go back to that one, and he's gonna jump over my ass.
[384:42.62]He's definitely not gonna go into the corner.
[384:50.38]I mean, this is, I can just see what he does.
[384:52.22]He's gonna move backwards.
[384:59.50]I gotta get this, I gotta get a piece down in the corner.
[385:08.80]Why is he doing that?
[385:15.15]Wait, no, no, he can't go that way.
[385:18.19]He can't go diagonal.
[385:20.29]Can he?
[385:24.41]Wait, I think he can.
[385:28.07]That's freaking me out.
[385:33.77]No, he definitely can't.
[385:35.43]Okay.
[385:36.01]Okay, this is in the right spot.
[385:38.63]Go back up there.
[385:40.25]Alright.
[385:41.93]Now... Let me see what happens if I do this.
[385:47.38]Okay, he'll only go there and there.
[385:50.34]If I move this down here, he's going to move probably down, right?
[385:54.68]He's going to jump that.
[385:56.20]This has to come down.
[386:02.20]God damn it.
[386:05.03]Because if I block this and he jumps, he does a double jump.
[386:30.07]I don't know how I'm going to get him to stay over here.
[386:32.47]Because it seems like he has an escape every time.
[386:38.08]Sacrifice a middle piece to make him jump into the corner.
[386:42.59]That's not a bad idea.
[386:43.73]Put this here and just make him jump over here.
[386:45.51]I guess I could do that.
[386:46.43]I hope it's not going to be a problem.
[386:48.59]But I guess we're going for it.
[386:53.13]Okay, now... Now he's trapped in here.
[387:09.11]Got him.
[387:13.56]There's now nowhere for him to go.
[387:15.54]He could go this way if he wants to.
[387:18.18]Which, okay, so hold on.
[387:22.14]If he moves to the left, he's going to jump this or down.
[387:24.66]I need to block this.
[387:27.22]Fuck.
[387:36.08]He's, I mean, he's going to go up.
[387:42.82]Stop and look.
[387:44.88]I know, but these games are so just, it's just brain mush, the experience.
[387:54.40]The bottom piece, like this one.
[388:01.45]He's gonna jump up.
[388:05.32]Somebody had a bet in their game studio.
[388:07.78]Like, can we make a Nancy Drew game a 20-hour game?
[388:10.68]No, impossible.
[388:11.54]I'll just make him do this five times.
[388:13.74]Oh, done.
[388:14.50]We did it.
[388:21.32]He can jump this.
[388:26.44]I have to block this or he's gone.
[388:27.78]Okay, now... He can't move diagonal.
[388:39.00]So if he goes down, he could jump to the left.
[388:44.56]But that's fine because I can move this here.
[388:46.44]And I think we got him.
[388:56.11]Not quite.
[389:40.59]I don't know what to do.
[390:03.76]yes you beat me another win another set of red eyes alright no one more one more I just gotta do this one more time and we win okay if we start over
[391:34.84]Get in there!
[391:35.22]Why are you doing that?
[391:56.62]Get in there!
[393:13.30]What the fuck did you just do?
[393:14.86]What did you just do to me?
[393:16.08]What did you just do?
[393:16.78]Get over there.
[393:25.09]What's happening?
[393:31.49]Okay, we start over.
[393:32.61]Oh my fucking god.
[393:34.30]This is the stupidest fucking thing ever.
[393:36.04]Are you kidding me, man?
[393:39.78]Like, it's just...
[393:42.20]Like, I, who, what?
[393:44.92]Nobody wants to do this puzzle.
[393:47.60]I guarantee you, all of you that have ever played this probably saw this happen and you went, oh, fuck no.
[393:54.72]Who wanted to do this?
[393:58.14]I don't even know anybody that would even make this that would say, you know what, I want to do this five times.
[394:02.32]Who would ever want to do this five times in a row?
[394:04.52]Unless you download the Fox and the fucking Goose game.
[394:09.29]That's like what I'm trying to do.
[394:10.77]That's what I'm doing.
[394:14.35]Like, who wants to play this besides people that actively are looking to play the Fox and the Goose game?
[394:30.80]It was so close, too, but it's just... God, hurry off!
[395:01.38]Wait, you can't go that way.
[395:06.10]Where was this one?
[395:44.98]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[395:54.10]It's 1 o'clock in the morning.
[395:55.10]What happened?
[395:56.32]Oh my god, it's 1 a.m.
[396:23.47]I almost got you, you motherfucker.
[396:25.67]Go that way, you're in trouble.
[396:26.81]I almost got you, you motherfucker.
[396:38.53]What's the correct play here?
[397:27.01]What do I do?
[397:30.91]Top one?
[397:43.30]Can you screw me if I move this here?
[397:47.60]As long as I move this and then the one right next to the right.
[397:53.76]If I go this one here and then this one here, he can't do anything, right?
[398:03.79]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[398:04.79]I'm seeing a lot of no's.
[398:07.03]He'll take the piece above it.
[398:10.62]Will he though?
[398:11.08]He doesn't have anywhere to go.
[398:11.82]I think that's correct.
[398:26.77]Yeah, it is correct.
[398:27.53]Because now, that's fine.
[398:32.63]I can sacrifice that one.
[398:35.41]Now he's in a bad spot.
[398:45.58]I couldn't hold that one.
[398:54.45]You can't wait, wait, wait, wait.
[398:55.63]He can't go this way.
[398:56.37]He can't, he has to go left.
[399:01.19]Fill out the corners.
[399:01.99]Wait, wait.
[399:02.57]I know.
[399:02.91]I've been doing this for so long and my brain is having problems.
[399:06.71]I think it's fine.
[399:08.59]This moves here.
[399:09.35]Right?
[399:11.69]Or do I just try to block him now?
[399:16.91]If I move this here, he has to go left.
[399:21.41]Block the middle one.
[399:24.22]And then take the top one, top left.
[399:30.72]This one goes top left now.
[399:33.38]He can't go anywhere.
[399:34.50]He really can't do much of anything.
[399:45.52]I win.
[399:48.00]Soon.
[399:52.32]Did I?
[399:52.60]Uh-oh.
[400:40.45]Give me my token now.
[400:42.89]Give me my token right now.
[400:46.58]That's it.
[400:47.02]I win.
[400:47.48]This game over.
[400:50.30]I thought the building was on fire.
[400:52.80]Let's go.
[400:54.80]Let's go.
[400:55.35]Alright, let's get out of here.
[401:01.83]It's like I was convinced that the building was on fire.
[401:03.75]It's way too cold to go out there now.
[401:07.86]I have to do it one more time?
[401:09.04]No, I don't.
[401:09.62]I already beat him once.
[401:15.96]No, no, no, no.
[401:16.63]It's only three.
[401:18.37]There's only three.
[401:22.47]It's not one more?
[401:23.67]They all have to be red.
[401:24.61]Yeah, no, that's one guy.
[401:27.97]Okay.
[401:28.27]No, we're good.
[401:29.63]This is kind of a lot of guys.
[401:30.72]I'm getting up bright and early in the morning.
[401:42.37]How do I make this what time I wake up?
[401:44.71]Right there, fine.
[401:47.05]No, not 12 AM.
[401:51.55]Oh, that sucks when you do AM instead of PM.
[401:54.29]I've been there before.
[401:55.79]Your whole life comes crashing down.
[401:57.39]Because you've been awoken very rudely.
[402:02.25]And sometimes it's not really... You can't go back to bed.
[402:05.81]So then you just screw it for the rest of the day.
[402:07.53]It sucks.
[402:09.99]I've been there before.
[402:13.81]Alright.
[402:15.21]Let's go.
[402:15.59]Time to see the conclusion of Nancy Drew.
[402:22.11]The Wilderness of the Wild White Fox.
[402:51.57]The title is not correct.
[402:53.65]Yeah, the title is not correct.
[402:55.39]I can't, this still, oh my god, there's a lot of people still here at one o'clock in the morning.
[402:59.54]Hey, well, we're good.
[403:00.14]We go till we beat it.
[403:00.88]I, you know, even if I have a few complaints, the game was probably a 9.5 out of 10.
[403:05.16]And then when we had to do the four games of, of Reversi or whatever the hell that is, uh, brought it down at least two letter grades, at least.
[403:26.86]Now we get to have this fun.
[403:30.58]Let's see.
[403:32.88]So, I got a picture of it.
[403:35.62]I've been like screaming too.
[403:37.40]It's been kind of a wild stream.
[403:38.98]Sorry about that.
[403:40.76]Today was going to be like a chill day.
[403:42.60]No cam.
[403:45.85]Sorry, we'll make up for it next time.
[403:49.75]Alright.
[403:51.91]Here we go.
[403:54.23]All the gates are open.
[403:55.97]So we just need forward, forward jump, forward.
[404:02.29]So forward, forward, forward jump.
[404:07.19]I'm gonna try it.
[404:10.55]Forward, forward, forward, jump.
[404:12.62]Isis, forward, forward, forward, jump, go.
[404:23.58]How you doing?
[404:27.78]Forward.
[404:30.27]Forward.
[404:32.63]Forward.
[404:33.67]Jump.
[404:38.27]Paw.
[404:39.23]Forward, forward, forward, jump, paw.
[404:46.88]I'll get it.
[404:52.77]four four four jump pa isis forward forward forward jump pa go australian hours yeah I'll tell you there's a lot of um I look at the demographics of the channel there's a lot of people from Australia that watch I actually think it's like the third or fourth demographic highest so um hello Australia
[405:23.00]Yeah, Asia too.
[405:23.79]Yeah.
[405:24.35]Just pure demographic wise, Australia is I think number three or four.
[405:30.47]You stream at great Aussie hours.
[405:31.87]Well, that's good.
[405:39.76]So that was one.
[405:40.64]Okay, now the other ones.
[405:46.36]Looks like left.
[405:48.57]Left.
[405:52.21]Left.
[405:54.96]left paw left left right paw let's try left left left right paw isis left left right paw forward I think uh I think isis goes forward already does it account for the first intersection
[406:22.89]It doesn't, okay.
[406:23.61]So forward, left, left, right, paw.
[406:33.19]Forward, left, right, paw.
[406:38.40]Isis, forward, left, left, right, paw, go.
[406:51.13]Why'd I go right?
[406:53.17]Because forward, left, left.
[406:55.67]Do I have to turn that corner?
[406:56.87]I think is what I... This is left.
[407:00.61]This is left.
[407:02.11]And right.
[407:04.10]Paw.
[407:08.16]What happened?
[407:09.10]Forward.
[407:10.06]Do I not need... Okay, so that corner on the bottom doesn't matter.
[407:13.28]So it's just forward, left, left, paw.
[407:14.36]They don't need to go right.
[407:21.15]Okay, so forward, left, left, paw.
[407:25.20]Forward.
[407:26.38]Left.
[407:26.74]Paw.
[407:27.36]Isis.
[407:28.08]Forward.
[407:28.92]Left.
[407:29.72]Left.
[407:30.46]Paw.
[407:31.22]Go.
[407:31.56]There's no intersection there yet.
[407:33.60]That's true.
[407:37.92]Why is the cave green?
[407:38.96]Oh, that would be all the radiation.
[407:40.88]And I wish I was making that up, but that's actually what that is.
[407:42.78]Alright, one more.
[407:56.02]This looks like it's forward, right, left, paw.
[408:00.28]Forward, right, left, paw.
[408:01.72]No, wait, forward, right, forward.
[408:06.84]Technically, that's an intersection.
[408:12.22]What about jump?
[408:13.02]Oh, there is a jump, right?
[408:13.82]Hold on.
[408:16.75]So it's forward.
[408:17.63]Forward.
[408:19.05]Right.
[408:19.25]Right.
[408:20.87]Right.
[408:25.31]Jump or forward again?
[408:26.61]Forward jump?
[408:32.61]Forward, right, forward, jump.
[408:34.57]I think, yeah, I think I'd have to say, yeah, I think I'd have to say forward jump.
[408:39.19]Left paw.
[408:40.29]Left paw.
[408:41.71]Isis, forward, right, forward, jump, left paw, go.
[408:47.48]I think that's right.
[408:58.12]forward right this is an intersection here so forward again jump over the hole forward again taking a left paw there it is cool that was fun I like that one I just didn't like opening all the gates with the convoluted way to do it I just gained a leather one half letter grade
[409:30.20]Drink some water?
[409:31.90]I- I have been.
[409:33.74]I'm hydrated, don't worry.
[409:36.20]Alright.
[409:37.52]That is it.
[409:38.62]It is now time to go open all this shit up and finally see what's going on in this world.
[409:54.69]It's time to party.
[409:58.52]Skiing guy.
[410:28.25]And Lou.
[410:31.05]Both of them.
[410:32.55]They both did it.
[410:33.13]Uh, what do I do with this?
[410:35.29]Somebody behind me?
[410:36.31]I'm gonna hit clap.
[411:04.13]What is this kid doing?
[411:05.07]You didn't have to play Reversi for four hours?
[411:07.39]What do you mean?
[411:21.08]All I know is I found a bag, Lou Talbot's bag, and it's full of explosives.
[411:25.66]There's just a door to come down here.
[411:26.88]Who is the one who has been blowing up things?
[411:29.08]He is the bomber?
[411:30.58]He's been excavating dinosaur bones.
[411:32.87]He may be responsible for a lot of the other stuff that's been going on around here too.
[411:37.35]You must stay here and guard the bag.
[411:39.57]I will ski back to the lodge very quickly and tell the handyman to call the authorities.
[411:43.81]Then I will return.
[411:45.31]You will be safe?
[411:46.77]Perhaps I should stay.
[411:49.68]This guy's full of shit.
[411:50.60]This is very clear.
[411:51.02]Yeah, this is the villain.
[411:52.16]It's 990.
[412:08.00]Wait a minute.
[412:09.16]What she just did means the scent on that glove and the scent on that thing Yanni dropped are the same.
[412:15.36]Which means the person who's been wearing that snowmobiling suit and blowing things up is Yanni.
[412:21.22]Geophone data... uranium?
[412:24.30]Oh my gosh, he set the timer.
[412:26.04]It looks like he's about to blow up the hill.
[412:28.26]Oh, there was just a door.
[412:29.42]We've got to get out of here, fast.
[412:31.17]I was skiing and I found a door and I walked in it.
[412:37.21]Now, it would have been more believable if you told me, I had to play that old man at that game that he played.
[412:44.19]I had to beat him four times.
[412:47.70]It was very tricky.
[412:54.84]You don't say I found a door.
[412:57.18]Buddy, I've been looking around this place for three weeks.
[412:58.92]What blazes happen here?
[413:00.53]There's no door.
[413:01.43]I need to borrow your snowmobile.
[413:02.95]I'll explain later.
[413:11.14]Ollie, I need to borrow your snowmobile.
[413:13.28]I'll explain later.
[413:14.18]Ollie, I need to borrow your snowmobile.
[413:17.42]I'll explain later.
[413:18.32]They can get away from me.
[413:34.17]Snowmobile race.
[413:39.43]I hate that I can see all the gross shit on my monitor.
[413:52.82]No way, we both just did that.
[414:01.86]You don't have those moments where you just go, man, I sneezed like a month ago and it's still right there, isn't it?
[414:15.83]What the hell?
[414:16.72]Where are you taking him?
[414:54.84]Get over here!
[415:33.75]This is so stupid.
[415:41.89]Oh my goodness.
[415:47.71]Can I cut across somewhere, maybe?
[415:55.01]I don't know.
[416:04.98]Yep, that's the play.
[416:06.37]Alright, if we go past there again, I'm going that other way.
[416:10.37]I'm trying to cut him off.
[417:37.40]God damn it!
[417:38.18]Did I get the pin?
[417:47.31]Oh my god.
[417:48.03]That's a Wario screamer that was.
[417:51.52]lying there in the snow defeated yanni owned up to everything he tainted the potato salad with bad mayonnaise he iced down the back stairs he opened a gas valve in the sauna he blew up the bunkhouse using the clock he took from guadalupe's room and he left those pictures of bill kessler for me in the sauna although he swears the door got stuck by accident in order to cast suspicion on someone else he did all this because he wanted everyone to leave icicle creek lodge why
[418:18.11]Hmm.
[418:44.49]Chantal has barely been off the phone since she got back to the lodge.
[418:47.79]It seems that Yanni's shenanigans made the nightly news, not just in Canada, but in the States.
[418:52.80]And as a result, people have been booking stays right and left, much to her delight.
[418:57.44]When I told her and Ollie how Isis had helped me, they were truly amazed.
[419:01.79]Hopefully, from now on, Ollie will think twice about pulling out his rifle every time he sees a varmint.
[419:07.64]As for Isis, Guadalupe called me that very night and told me she'd found a wolf sanctuary that could take her.
[419:13.50]I could tell from the way the volunteers from the sanctuary treated her when they came to get her that she'll be in good hands at her new home.
[419:20.32]But still, it's sad that through no fault of her own, she can never run free again.
[419:25.23]They said it's possible that she might someday be released back into the wild, but not very likely.
[419:32.97]I'm going to keep my fingers crossed anyway.
[419:37.97]I told you.
[419:39.61]I had it from the very beginning.
[419:41.76]That dog was good.
[419:42.62]I told you that.
[419:44.04]You've been awarded the title of... Got it.
[420:02.13]When Beth suggested we head to New Orleans for a short vacation, I thought it was a great idea.
[420:07.00]The French Quarter, fantastic food, awesome music, friendly people.
[420:12.54]But all it took was one little side trip to check on a friend of Ned's.
[420:16.12]And suddenly, everything got very strange.
[420:20.21]A recent death, a musty old mansion, a disturbingly odd curio shop, a garden where only secrets seem to grow, and something as ancient as it was terrifying.
[420:33.43]Join me on my next adventure, Legend of the Crystal Skull.
[420:39.87]I would, Nancy, but unfortunately I'm going to need a shovel to dig out all the buried copies of the game.
[420:46.10]I did say that, yeah.
[420:55.45]That was cute.
[420:56.17]I liked it.
[420:56.61]That was cute.
[420:57.97]It was worth playing it.
[420:58.90]I'm glad we did it.
[420:59.60]It was a lot of fun to be had.
[421:00.98]Lots of funny things we talked about.
[421:03.02]Lots of interesting things we did.
[421:04.68]I liked it.
[421:07.02]Nancy Drew and the Icicle Wolf of Icicle Creek.
[421:12.85]Just move those words around to where they belong.
[421:16.35]So, next time you'll see Nancy Drew...
[421:21.65]Hey, did you really think you were going to get a Nancy Drew game today?
[421:26.06]Yesterday?
[421:27.84]Did you think you were going to get a Nancy Drew game?
[421:29.76]There's no way that you thought that.
[421:31.20]And we did it.
[421:34.24]So I have like 30 of these.
[421:37.30]So we can do another one eventually.
[421:39.44]And it's fun.
[421:43.54]You skipped half the game?
[421:44.48]No, I didn't.
[421:44.96]Half the game was the reversing game.
[421:49.56]Yeah, with that, I'm going to call it seven hours.
[421:52.92]I think that's a good place to stop.
[421:55.36]So I'm trying to think of... Is there like a post-credits scene?
[422:07.04]You scummed at checkers.
[422:09.35]Well, I scummed at the coin swap machine thingy.
[422:16.73]That was fun.
[422:20.12]I had a great time.
[422:20.66]I always have a great time when I play these.
[422:22.63]As long as you guys are having fun.
[422:24.43]As long as it's fun to watch and fun to be a part of.
[422:26.39]That's usually how it works.
[422:28.03]Alright, the next stream is gonna probably be probably the Resident Evil launch.
[422:37.58]When is that?
[422:37.94]Two or three days?
[422:43.14]23rd?
[422:43.38]24th?
[422:44.04]It's probably the 24th in the middle of the afternoon.
[422:58.28]Hmm.
[423:00.88]Because what's probably going to end up happening is I'm going to play that just until it's done.
[423:06.82]I imagine that's going to be probably like a Friday, Saturday, Sunday ordeal.
[423:15.77]How long is Resident Evil 4?
[423:17.83]It's like 15 to 20 hours or something, right?
[423:23.13]Somewhere in that range.
[423:29.11]Maybe a little bit more, maybe a little bit less.
[423:33.93]So that's what we'll do.
[423:36.78]I will see you guys again on the 24th.
[423:38.36]And we're just going to go until I beat it for two or three days in a row.
[423:46.40]That seems like the next logical time for me to come back.
[423:49.71]Plus, that also gives me the opportunity for the next few days to get some Grotto Beasts stuff situated.
[423:57.48]Because as of now, we're starting to kind of come out of this pre-sale period.
[424:03.43]And there is a couple things to make sure go off well.
[424:08.83]You'll see very soon.
[424:16.01]Yeah.
[424:16.68]I'll see you guys on Friday.
[424:18.66]Thanks for watching.
[424:20.64]Friday, Saturday, Sunday, probably.
[424:22.00]Or at least starting on Friday.
[424:23.16]And we're just going for however many hours or days it takes to beat Resident Evil 4.
[424:31.67]And when I actually, the next time you see me, I might have something interesting to tell you or show you perhaps we'll see maybe soon we'll see maybe not guaranteed, but maybe
[424:58.72]Alright, buddy.
[424:59.10]See you later.
[425:00.82]That's the wrong thing.
[425:03.55]Hey, there it is.
[425:07.95]Thanks for the subs, everybody.
[425:09.67]Thanks for watching.
[425:10.21]Thanks for supporting the stream.
[425:13.19]Kind of unhinged today.
[425:14.21]But I think Nancy Drew just kind of pulls that out of us.
[425:18.29]Me, specifically.
[425:25.82]We'll see you again.
[425:28.81]I'm very excited for Resident Evil 4.
[425:30.39]It's getting really great reviews.
[425:32.01]Although, I mean, it's a remake of the one that already got really great reviews.
[425:35.36]But this one's getting very good reviews too.
[425:38.98]Making a remake could have the opposite happen where it's not as good as the original.
[425:42.94]But apparently this is incredible.
[425:46.44]Most outlets are giving this high nines, even tens.
[425:51.10]So I'm very, very excited because I love the fourth game.
[425:54.51]I've played through it many times, at least three or four times, many times.
[426:00.13]We'll see how it holds up.
[426:00.89]I'm very excited.
[426:09.72]The Resident Evil 2 remake was incredible, I'm sure.
[426:12.06]Yeah, we talked about it in the very beginning of the stream.
[426:13.74]It'd be kind of funny if... Because I gave Resident Evil 2 remake Game of the Year.
[426:18.22]It'd be funny if I gave this just two remakes in three years, getting Game of the Year for me.
[426:23.32]Alright, let's raid somebody.
[426:28.70]I want to, you know who I want to raid?
[426:32.16]Let me bring up their stream.
[426:33.78]Let's get a raid going.
[426:37.04]I want to raid.
[426:37.84]Okay.
[426:55.02]Oh, let me see.
[426:56.16]I want to raid Sea Dog.
[427:00.16]CDawg VA.
[427:02.88]CDawg's currently doing a charity cyclothon from Nagasaki to Kumamoto.
[427:12.22]Big charity cyclothon.
[427:15.15]Go say hello.
[427:16.93]Connor is an awesome dude.
[427:19.09]CDawg.
[427:24.21]Go say hi.
[427:31.04]Charity Liker.
[427:32.18]That's right.
[427:41.53]I'll see you guys later.
[427:43.09]Thanks for watching.
[427:44.11]Take care of yourselves.
[427:48.13]Bye-bye.
[427:56.35]Also, we got a few coins to spare.
[428:00.37]The donation, the goal right now is 150k.
[428:02.82]It's currently at 132k.
[428:05.86]So if you got some spare coin, you know where to put it.
[428:12.81]See you guys soon.
[428:13.37]Take care.
[428:31.86]you
[429:02.97]Hey, we can get this to 10K.
[429:05.29]We can get this to 10K.
[429:06.55]Let's get a 10K rate on Charity Street.
[429:07.93]Come on, let's do it.
[429:09.35]We can get this to 10K.
[429:09.91]We can do it.
[429:11.11]Let's do it.
[429:12.83]We can get this to 10K.
[429:13.51]Come on.
[429:19.22]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[429:24.64]If we don't, it's fine.
[429:28.46]Come on, Gwen.
[429:34.83]I think everyone just left already.
[429:36.69]It's alright.
[429:37.63]Alright, see you guys later.
[429:40.00]See you on Friday.
[429:40.76]Have a great night.
[429:42.70]Take care of yourselves.
[429:43.28]Goodbye.
[430:16.48]Thank you.
