[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.31]Hey.
[00:02.77]What's up?
[00:04.65]How are you?
[00:09.65]What's going on?
[00:10.32]Oh, it's because the AC is on.
[00:12.50]Hold on a second.
[00:16.30]Oh, shit.
[00:16.84]Uh-oh.
[00:19.94]Oh!
[00:20.70]God, what the fuck?
[00:22.24]What a disaster.
[00:24.97]What's going on?
[00:27.13]Is my gate too low right now?
[00:28.91]Hold on.
[00:30.82]I gotta change this.
[00:35.82]Give me one second.
[00:41.16]Is this, is it like fucked up again?
[00:42.30]Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello.
[00:53.28]What is going on?
[00:57.47]Hold on, listen.
[01:03.04]What?
[01:04.14]I need to hear this.
[01:04.98]What the fuck is this?
[01:05.64]What's this for?
[01:07.94]What's going on?
[01:11.58]Let me be able to hear it.
[01:13.48]I can... Yeah, this is... You hear that?
[01:17.40]It's like... Dude, I gotta... Okay, hold on.
[01:30.71]There we go.
[01:33.08]There we go.
[01:33.60]That's better.
[01:38.91]Okay.
[01:40.35]Alright.
[01:43.21]Perfect.
[01:44.63]We are back to normal.
[01:47.39]That was really weird.
[01:49.91]Okay, so let me turn this down a little bit.
[01:55.79]Just stop the stream.
[01:58.21]Put the audio back on for you.
[02:01.14]Okay.
[02:02.52]Hi, everybody.
[02:02.96]Welcome.
[02:04.14]Sorry about that.
[02:04.72]That was a quick little change I had to do.
[02:10.77]Oh, I almost unplugged my fucking entire setup.
[02:12.81]That would have been so bad.
[02:15.35]We're gonna do something different today.
[02:17.27]Well, not really.
[02:17.99]I feel like I'm the guy that has streamed every microphone video game.
[02:23.66]We're getting close.
[02:26.12]That's what we're doing today.
[02:28.84]We are going to be playing...
[02:32.23]It's really not that different if you think about it.
[02:33.67]Uh, we're gonna be playing a game called Old Gamma.
[02:37.18]Which... It could be great, it could be awful.
[02:41.40]It's a game where you control troops on a battlefield with your voice while you play pinball on the battlefield with a gigantic fucking boulder.
[02:51.20]So... This is either pog or... eh.
[02:56.69]We'll find out.
[03:00.41]Let me change back to what I was doing.
[03:04.63]That's the first thing we're going to do.
[03:06.14]If it turns out this game is really fun and I want to play it forever, then that's what we'll do.
[03:11.20]We'll just sit here for a while.
[03:13.00]But if the game sucks, then we're going to pivot to Pokémon.
[03:17.28]That's right.
[03:18.37]Pokémon.
[03:22.23]Well, I mean, not necessarily actually Pokémon.
[03:27.73]I mean, this is a Pokémon game where you fucking watch TV with your Pokémon friends.
[03:34.42]It's a TV watching game, so it's not what you think.
[03:39.18]But, you know.
[03:42.92]It's Pokémon React.
[03:45.68]Pokémon React.
[03:54.63]I can't wait to be like a React-uber on the Pokémon game.
[03:59.23]Anyways, this can stay on.
[04:02.15]Here's the microphone.
[04:03.80]I was setting it up to make sure it worked.
[04:07.48]Hello.
[04:09.54]Hello.
[04:10.96]This is a test of the microphone.
[04:12.10]It seems to be working pretty well.
[04:15.99]It works pretty well.
[04:17.83]I got the GameCube controller.
[04:19.43]I think I'm ready to move.
[04:20.25]Okay.
[04:23.68]Fake voice.
[04:25.36]He's peaking his mic.
[04:26.88]Oh, fuck.
[04:28.88]No, I don't want to break this.
[04:30.33]Should I lower it?
[04:32.93]I don't want to break it.
[04:33.63]If I break it... I mean, the lick it really fucking matters.
[04:37.11]There's like four games that utilized the GameCube mic.
[04:42.11]Two of them are Mario Party.
[04:44.62]One of them is this.
[04:47.08]And the other one is a game we've already played.
[04:49.26]Chibi Robot.
[04:50.08]I didn't even know.
[04:52.58]I think there's four games that actually use this.
[04:56.95]Hello.
[04:58.33]No, this is fine.
[05:00.09]It's not peaking the mic.
[05:01.17]That just means you can hear you very well.
[05:06.77]How do you use it in Chibi-Robo?
[05:07.97]I have no idea.
[05:08.75]I was actually going to look it up.
[05:12.17]Alright, let's go.
[05:14.39]Can you guys hear this?
[05:15.66]Why can I not hear this?
[05:18.64]I should be able to hear this.
[05:23.27]Oh, there is no sound.
[05:26.20]Oh, okay.
[05:28.50]That's like fucking Resident Evil sound.
[05:30.94]I just thought I was playing Resident Evil.
[05:33.80]That's the sound it makes when you move items around in Resident Evil 1 and 2.
[05:40.09]Okay, let's go.
[05:43.67]I did a little testing to make sure.
[05:48.15]This is Odomo.
[05:50.46]What's going on with the sadness right now?
[05:54.02]Why is everybody so sad?
[05:56.54]What's with the sadness?
[05:58.62]Why are you guys doing sadness?
[06:02.92]Why are you guys so sad?
[06:04.12]What's fucking going on here?
[06:05.30]Oh, because of the quarantine.
[06:14.54]Oh yeah, that is true.
[06:15.36]That's fucking not good.
[06:20.01]Alright, we'll watch the cutscene.
[06:21.81]We'll be back in a minute.
[06:25.47]Is this the opening cutscene?
[06:26.41]This land has been governed by Lord Yamanuchi Nobatu.
[06:35.74]When Lord trusted Vassal, he betrayed him.
[06:41.28]Lord Yamamuchi took his own life rather than bear the shame of defeat.
[06:44.90]I feel like I'm a shitty translator at an event.
[06:50.49]okay and uh and he also says um I can't wait for uh next year when you all show I feel like I'm a shitty translator I'm getting off the screen
[07:14.43]Calm back.
[07:14.89]What's going on here?
[07:15.87]There are two secrets that their longtime foes knew nothing about.
[07:18.66]Well, if this was an actual dub, it would be more like this.
[07:38.21]This giant ball was said to have been legend held that when unleashed in battle, the Odama could inflict untold damage to foes or grant great power to allies.
[07:51.40]But these legends remain untested.
[07:56.06]The other secret was the doctrine of Nintendo.
[07:59.70]The word Nintendo is formed from the first kanji of three proverbs.
[08:04.75]ninja mushin attend to one's duties tensai korin those in heaven will descend and doji sumi moral action is the way of ninten illustrates the mindset of the kagetori army soldiers who have entrusted themselves to the heavens it's going too fast it's going too fast Larry Larry I can't keep it up you're going too fast slow the thing down
[08:33.62]Remember the power of the Nintendo?
[08:35.60]Slide it into the dungeon of Sorasama Keep and your victory will ring throughout this land.
[08:59.15]I'm gonna bring the can back.
[09:00.23]Just hold on.
[09:00.67]We'll watch the opening cutscene.
[09:08.26]You'll play this, but not Nioh?
[09:11.78]Nioh does not have a comedy microphone.
[09:15.92]If Nioh was controlled with a comedy mic, maybe I would consider it.
[09:21.93]This looks like a fucking e-cigar.
[09:26.88]Don't you think I'm gonna like fucking just go like this, like... And just blow a fucking cloud over here?
[09:36.05]The e-cigar!
[09:37.05]Nintendo!
[09:37.95]Are we done with... Wait, wasn't that just... Yes, yes, yes.
[09:46.19]Let's go.
[09:46.49]Okay, I'm ready.
[09:52.53]Kurua Plains.
[09:55.85]Start.
[09:57.51]Now, my lead.
[09:58.65]Off to battle.
[09:59.79]Why do I feel like this is the Wiimote in the nunchuck?
[10:03.84]I'm the nunchuck in this scenario.
[10:05.52]I have to talk.
[10:06.80]How do I do this?
[10:07.54]We must first meet our foe on the plains of Kurua.
[10:13.49]Look closely, my lead.
[10:16.71]Okay.
[10:17.01]The enemy attempts to halt our advance at the far bank of the river.
[10:29.55]If we are to close the floodgate first, this will stop the river.
[10:37.70]Once the river is blocked, we can cross without fear.
[10:42.71]Okay, we must ensure that the Ninten Bell passes through the gate at the far end of the field.
[10:52.79]When do I use this?
[10:54.18]Oh, I almost forgot.
[11:10.58]We must win this battle by sundown.
[11:12.56]Why is there like a Mario fly hat symbol button over there?
[11:17.71]You have to go by sundown.
[11:22.09]Hit the floodgate with the odama.
[11:27.51]Alright.
[11:29.55]So it's right.
[11:30.13]Three, two, one.
[11:31.97]Alright, here we go.
[11:32.79]Wait, it's firing?
[11:35.39]Move!
[11:37.98]I'm killing my own troops.
[11:39.52]Watch out for the ball.
[11:43.21]I have to have to break the river.
[11:45.49]Why is it?
[11:50.93]What am I supposed to do?
[11:52.83]Where's the ball?
[11:55.85]Fall back.
[11:57.71]Send backup.
[12:00.71]More troops.
[12:03.75]I gotta break that.
[12:04.91]Did I do it?
[12:06.29]You don't have commands.
[12:07.21]Advance.
[12:07.53]Yeah, let's practice, please.
[12:08.75]Okay.
[12:09.07]Place the cursor over your men and give them your orders.
[12:13.05]Clearly into the microphone.
[12:29.47]This pinball with extra steps.
[12:31.99]With a cursor over your men?
[12:33.13]Okay.
[12:33.69]Advance.
[12:48.05]How do you play with both hands?
[12:52.85]This is like, this is playing games while eating simulator.
[12:57.26]You know, you're like, yeah, hold on a second.
[13:03.58]Like, I can't, this is gonna be fucking impossible.
[13:06.56]Fall back.
[13:07.12]Fall back.
[13:11.89]March right.
[13:13.31]March left.
[13:13.67]March left.
[13:14.95]They're going right.
[13:16.07]Wait, so duct tape it to the, hold on.
[13:42.25]Don't touch this with my mouth.
[13:43.67]Did I sanitize this?
[13:46.45]Oh, it was in a package.
[13:47.87]It was in plastic.
[13:52.55]Okay.
[13:53.35]I think we're good.
[13:56.45]It was in a brand new... This is brand new.
[13:58.18]I'm the first person to put this near their mouth.
[14:00.48]I lost.
[14:00.86]What?
[14:05.20]What?
[14:11.06]Yeah, let's try it again.
[14:13.94]Wait, the ball went down.
[14:15.32]I have to start the whole fucking thing over again.
[14:20.13]Alright, I'm ready.
[14:22.91]Carry the ball through the gate.
[14:24.95]Alright.
[14:27.15]Oh, I can aim it.
[14:28.11]Oh, let's go all the way.
[14:28.87]No, no, no, over here.
[14:31.45]Try to break that gate.
[14:34.81]Done.
[14:36.31]Okay, now I get commands.
[14:37.29]Here we go.
[14:40.99]You have learned the command, Press Forward.
[14:44.49]The command orders your men to press forward and repel the enemy.
[14:48.75]Place your cursor over your men and say, Press Forward.
[14:51.17]Your bell crew will summon every last ounce of strength to push through the enemy forces.
[14:58.99]Will it still hear me if I go like this?
[15:08.97]My pants are kind of loose.
[15:09.93]That went all the way down the underwear.
[15:15.55]That went, like, straight down over, like, to the underwear.
[15:25.37]Only troops who pass through the gate will join you at the start of the next battle.
[15:28.59]Any troops rallied at the bell when you give the order.
[15:31.73]Wait, okay.
[15:32.21]So any... Press forward.
[15:36.83]Alright.
[15:38.31]I have to play like pinball.
[15:51.10]Press forward.
[15:57.04]March left.
[16:03.18]Press forward.

[17:29.69]What just happened?
[17:33.39]You have learned a command called Flank and Destroy.
[17:39.74]This thrilling command orders your troops to engage the enemy.
[17:42.42]What the fuck have they been doing this whole time?
[17:46.76]Flank and destroy.
[17:51.75]Flank and destroy.
[17:52.55]Okay.
[18:08.64]Flank and destroy.

[18:33.06]Advance.
[18:34.54]Prove we can trust you.
[18:35.52]What the fuck are you talking about?
[18:38.06]What?! !
[18:44.53]Prove we can trust you first.
[18:55.12]Okay.
[18:56.16]What does deploy mean?
[19:00.90]Wait, I can... Advance.
[19:06.74]Push forward.

[20:37.44]What the fuck did I just do?
[20:39.72]Get up there, get up there, get up there.
[20:41.14]Advance.
[20:45.96]Flank and destroy.
[20:53.70]Bell?

[21:29.31]Go in the fucking door!
[21:32.15]Go in!
[21:32.63]Why?
[21:32.85]What's with the traffic jam?
[21:35.24]Go in.
[21:36.82]Advance.
[21:43.68]What was the plan?
[21:45.64]What am I?
[21:46.02]I already forgot what?
[21:48.06]Press forward.
[22:03.19]What is advance and press forward?
[22:05.71]What's the difference?
[22:07.99]Advance.
[22:08.41]Okay, we advance.
[22:09.73]Press forward.
[22:10.39]You go forward.
[22:11.01]That's advance.
[22:12.41]That's advancing.
[22:21.41]Okay, line the ruin before your might.
[22:29.53]Can somebody please give me an edit?
[22:31.37]Somebody please.
[22:32.08]I know one of you will do it before the stream ends.
[22:33.76]Just please do this.
[22:35.58]You know exactly what I'm looking for.
[22:37.90]You know what I want you to do.
[22:38.90]Okay?
[22:41.50]Just hold on a second.

[23:48.82]Alright, that's all I want.
[23:49.48]You know what I want.
[23:59.24]You know what I want.
[24:00.04]That's all I care about.
[24:00.81]I don't care about anything else.
[24:06.79]I need you to do a ton of vapor coming out of my mouth.
[24:09.31]That's all I want.
[24:10.05]I don't care.
[24:14.57]That's all I care about.
[24:15.45]Here we go.
[24:18.59]It's coffee!
[24:19.15]Holy shit there's new mechanics here.
[24:45.12]THE BELL CREW CANNOT CLIMB THIS HILL!
[24:48.02]THE BELL CREW!
[24:49.42]Our troops must prepare the way by setting a ladder?
[24:55.20]Okay.
[24:55.30]Knock the key- Oh, knock the keyframe with the eye!
[24:58.90]Three, two, one, oh fuck.
[25:17.78]Get up there.
[25:19.34]Blank and destroy.
[25:24.04]Protect the bell.
[25:26.30]March right.
[25:28.48]Buy shit on fire.
[25:31.62]Fall back.
[25:33.09]Fall back.
[25:34.41]Fall.
[25:34.77]Fall back.
[25:35.83]Fall back.
[25:36.95]Fall back.
[25:41.61]Oh, people just got wiped out.
[25:44.17]March left.
[25:47.19]I gotta get in there.
[25:47.97]Fall back.
[25:54.45]Rally.
[25:55.52]Okay.
[26:00.80]This command orders your troops to gather in the area you have highlighted with the cursor.
[26:05.44]Oh, this is what I'm looking for.
[26:09.46]Rally into the microphone.
[26:14.06]Occupy enemy installations.
[26:16.74]Let's try it.
[26:19.27]Rally.
[26:25.77]Alright, let me try this.
[26:27.43]I gotta hit the key.
[26:29.33]Oh, I got another ball.
[26:32.33]It's okay.
[26:33.72]How do I move the cursor?
[26:35.32]Rally.
[26:37.50]No, advance.

[29:10.63]They won't fucking rally.
[29:11.69]We lost.
[29:17.01]Bad general tactics.
[29:19.96]Imagine if there's a guy just sitting behind everybody with a fucking megaphone, just screaming all of that.
[29:24.14]How could they even hear me?
[29:26.50]No one can hear anything I'm saying.
[29:29.78]You have to go to the ladder.
[29:33.73]I was trying to get them to go to the ladder.
[29:35.03]They wouldn't go.
[29:35.59]I was going, rally.
[29:37.39]Rally to the ladder.

[29:49.46]Knock the key free with the odama to grab it.
[29:52.34]We're going right up the middle.

[31:50.19]Bounce around, everywhere.

[32:29.80]They won't even go do this!
[32:32.57]Use the C-stick?
[32:33.57]It doesn't do anything.
[32:36.61]We all- we're all dead.
[32:37.43]Again.
[32:39.17]March left.
[32:43.51]Move the cursor.
[32:45.25]I- it won't go any further to the corner!
[32:48.91]Look!
[32:51.59]It won't go any higher.
[33:00.06]D-pad?
[33:02.16]What?
[33:02.46]The D-pad isn't going to do anything.
[33:04.89]Make them march to the left.
[33:17.27]Bilateral Lich 5,000 bits, $50.
[33:19.91]Jerma, here's $50.
[33:20.95]Now, march your men left and select the ladder.
[33:23.03]You have to have the bell closer.
[33:24.69]Thanks for the $50 tip.
[33:25.87]Thanks for the actual tip.
[33:26.59]But I can't advance up there if they all fucking die.
[33:28.07]Alright, just get them all out of here.
[33:46.65]Oh my god, why is it so crunchy?
[33:51.47]March left.
[33:55.39]This is a really good start, though.

[34:42.14]March left.
[34:44.48]March left.

[34:59.13]Fall back.
[34:59.61]Fall back.
[35:08.78]Fall back.
[35:12.06]March left.
[35:17.54]Dude, it has nothing to do with the bell.
[35:20.68]Rally.
[35:22.66]I can't physically go any higher the way the cursor is right now.
[35:28.73]Use the D-pad?
[35:37.79]Rally.
[35:54.89]Who's making fucking popcorn?

[36:42.52]I have no fucking idea what's going on, but we did it.
[36:48.38]Alright, so select, it's not like use the cursor, it's like pick the one out of two spots with the d-pad.

[37:59.97]Beyond those gates, we will face a general who will take all our might and cunning to defeat.
[38:10.91]Oh, the river.
[38:11.47]This is going to be painful.
[38:14.21]It's a pulley to the nearest floodgate.
[38:17.03]We can control the flow of that river.
[38:29.00]This is a lot.
[38:29.54]This is too much to do.
[38:30.54]Stick the mic up your nose.
[38:31.86]No.
[38:32.04]Okay.
[38:32.70]Give me the key.
[38:33.81]Give me the... Okay, I got a new command.
[38:35.81]Close the gate.
[39:05.91]What?
[39:08.69]You can seal the floodgate.
[39:11.07]Once your men have fixed the pulley to the gate, order them to close the gate.
[39:13.99]The gate will fall into place.
[39:16.73]Once the gate is closed, say, flood the river to open it.
[39:20.67]Close the gate.
[39:27.29]Fart into the mic?
[39:29.93]Oh wow, that's fucking hilarious.
[39:33.79]Blood the river.

[42:06.34]There you go.

[42:13.54]Get the key too.
[42:14.48]Don't rally there yet.
[42:19.00]Get that fucking key.
[42:19.74]Good.
[42:21.77]What a good start.
[42:22.89]Rally.
[42:27.46]Fucking noise is so... The crunching sounds in that... I don't know what it is with this shit.
[42:44.34]Tape it?
[42:48.34]I could tape it, like, around my neck.
[42:50.85]I'm not at that point yet.
[42:55.35]Tape... Hold on.
[44:26.48]Ready Gamer neck brace
[44:57.59]Tape it to the controller.
[45:06.09]Oh, shit.
[45:10.02]I could have taped it this way and just hold it right here.
[45:13.42]He's the supreme commander.
[45:23.32]Where's my... Oh, my headphones are already in.
[45:25.38]Okay.
[45:26.50]I'm ready.
[45:38.51]It's hard to, when I like swallow, my neck pulses.
[45:41.99]Okay, let's go.
[45:42.41]Okay, good, good, good start.

[45:59.94]Rally.
[46:06.42]Good.
[46:17.98]Give me that spool.
[46:18.80]Plugging is no shit.
[46:26.28]Rally.
[46:27.90]No, no, no, no, no.
[46:28.70]I forgot.
[46:33.61]We've used the key to open the gate.
[46:40.03]Rally.
[46:42.45]Oh, that was a good hit.
[46:47.61]Bloodgate!
[46:48.31]Watch out!
[46:49.61]Okay.
[46:50.27]The troops have taken the pulley.
[46:54.27]What's the command?
[46:56.59]What's the command?
[46:59.89]Advance.
[47:03.53]What's the command?
[47:05.31]Move right.
[47:06.97]No, no, no.
[47:07.23]It's not.
[47:07.53]It's like, it's like, close the pulley or something.
[47:17.32]Close the gate.
[47:44.54]You look dumb.
[47:52.68]What's this?

[47:54.66]Game- Why are people- What are people linking here?
[47:56.66]Controllers.
[47:57.12]GameCube.
[48:19.27]However, the enemy has a well-used camp on the Kurugawa River.
[48:23.07]There is also a river where the water gate opens and closes, so it is important to obtain the water gate and control the flow.
[48:31.94]If you gather the soldiers in the Hashigoyagura, you will soon fall and become a bridge.
[48:54.41]This is why you always check what the contents of the bag are.
[48:59.05]Always check the contents of the bag.
[50:12.44]Okay.
[50:14.90]That's very difficult to do.
[50:17.44]Oh my god.
