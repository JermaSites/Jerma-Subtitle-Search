[ve:61.1.100]

[00:26.14]Hello, hello.
[00:31.23]Good evening.
[00:35.03]Good afternoon.
[00:36.11]Good everything.
[00:38.04]How you doing?
[00:42.42]Welcome to another live stream.
[00:48.00]You better be ready to laugh your ass off.
[00:49.79]Yeah.
[00:54.98]We got some stuff to do today.
[00:56.29]I will go over it.
[01:02.37]We're going to wait a minute or two because there's a lot of shit for you to hear about this.
[01:11.33]There are a few things that need to be gone over before we do this.
[01:15.98]You understand?
[01:25.13]So let's chill.
[01:28.25]chill but chill but hypes in the chat.
[01:32.81]A mellowed out, chilled version of Let's Go.
[01:37.32]How about just hype with all lowercase?
[01:42.36]It's like, yeah, let's get hype, but not too much.
[01:45.45]Just a little bit.
[01:47.96]Okay.
[01:53.27]I don't want you to get that excited.
[02:00.27]Okay, so, uh, You Laugh, You Lose, and The Clay Stream.
[02:05.38]have been delayed about two or three months.
[02:10.18]Probably going to try to do some around May, June of this year.
[02:14.53]Really getting into that berry game.
[02:16.59]Figured out maybe I could play the berry game.
[02:20.67]Nah, alright.
[02:21.15]You laugh, you lose tonight.
[02:22.87]I'm gonna give you the rules.
[02:23.74]I'm gonna wait like another 10 seconds.
[02:26.39]Because a lot of people are probably gonna show up to this stream because a lot of people liked it.
[02:29.25]A lot of people were looking for this.
[02:31.43]It is January 31st, the last day that I had the chat Christmas presents, if you remember back in the Christmas time.
[02:42.61]January plus, because two of those streams are not going to happen today.
[02:48.68]But I've got breaking news.
[02:51.59]Breaking news.
[02:55.18]Trying to get it to work on Windows 11?
[03:05.13]Breaking news.
[03:06.74]It works.
[03:08.10]I got DG Voodoo.
[03:09.77]I got a Windows thing.
[03:12.56]It works and it can be captured.
[03:14.80]So it's ready to go.
[03:19.19]The movies is a whole nother...
[03:22.35]That's a whole, I gotta, I gotta figure that out.
[03:24.43]That one actually should theoretically be easier.
[03:29.25]So it's not going to happen today.
[03:33.11]But very soon, it's the next solo stream that I will do is going to be Casino Inc.
[03:43.36]whether that's Wednesday, Thursday, Friday of this coming week, the next stream that I do, that is just me sitting here.
[03:51.25]We might do some horseman stuff.
[03:54.06]So it will not be on the horseman day.
[03:59.16]Coming up probably next week.
[04:02.47]But yeah.
[04:04.92]So your presents are going to have to go a little bit into February.
[04:10.84]I saw somebody in chat say January DLC.
[04:13.96]And that's, yeah, that's a good way to put it.
[04:24.45]I feel betrayed.
[04:25.37]It's okay.
[04:27.65]Look, if it, it was a hundred percent guaranteed to happen by the end of January.
[04:34.25]But hey, we got most of them done.
[04:36.64]And I actually got it to work.
[04:38.85]So it's going to be like a week into February.
[04:41.65]It's fine.
[04:42.44]It's not a big deal.
[04:45.20]It's going to be January plus.
[04:48.49]It's happening.
[04:49.18]Don't worry.
[04:50.36]Alright.
[04:51.60]So what about today?
[04:53.65]Let's go over this.
[04:56.05]There were about 700 or 800 total submissions to this.
[05:01.82]We are not doing all of those.
[05:04.68]Thank you for submitting a clip to this.
[05:07.92]Thank you to the mods for putting this all together.
[05:11.46]They had a democratic process to figure out which ones they were going to show.
[05:18.98]So W mods.
[05:22.45]Appreciate it because I cannot see these because otherwise I will be prepared for them.
[05:27.41]Shout out to Holly too.
[05:29.20]Holly put together a playlist for me.
[05:34.65]And the mods, by the way, have gotten special privilege.
[05:38.10]They have put in a few of their own.
[05:40.77]So we'll see.
[05:44.53]On top of that, here's how today is going to work.
[05:50.04]It's a you laugh, you lose, right?
[05:52.69]I was trying to figure out if I want to just do this for fun, not have stakes on it.
[05:56.74]Just, oh, whatever.
[05:57.42]I just did it.
[05:57.93]No, I lost.
[05:59.82]But that's not going to fly.
[06:01.00]That's not going to work.
[06:03.16]So what I have decided, I was in pre-stream chat, I threw out some things, there were some ideas that I threw out that other people said might be good ideas too.
[06:11.16]Here's what's going to happen.
[06:14.62]Everybody that submitted a video, you had to give your Twitch username.
[06:18.58]So, we know who you are.
[06:21.53]So, if I laugh at your video,
[06:25.24]I wrote all this down, by the way, because it's a mouthful.
[06:27.94]Because you're going to need to hear the mouthful.
[06:32.76]If I laugh at a video, whoever submitted the video will give a game of their choice,
[06:38.94]that in a future stream I will play on stream for 30 minutes.
[06:44.11]Depending on how many times I laugh,
[06:46.50]This will be on the same stream.
[06:48.83]It's probably going to be the same day.
[06:51.54]The game must follow the following criteria.
[06:56.32]It must have been released on a major North American console, or currently available on Steam,
[07:03.51]Epic Games, GOG, or other current-gen storefronts, PS5, Switch, etc.?
[07:09.67]?
[07:10.83]This means it could be any North American console.
[07:17.60]If you've got a Super Nintendo game that you're like, holy shit.
[07:24.97]I'll make it work.
[07:28.52]The game must be TOS friendly.
[07:32.02]So sorry guys, no porn games.
[07:35.30]Uh, no porn games.
[07:37.68]I'm gonna say that again.
[07:39.15]And I'm just gonna say no.
[07:40.46]Alright, that's easy.
[07:42.46]Uh, it must not be on a handheld console.
[07:46.30]Sorry.
[07:48.65]And if you want me to play a PC game, it cannot predate 2004 or 2005.
[07:56.60]It has to be a fairly within the last 20ish years PC game.
[08:01.80]They're a huge pain in the fucking ass to get to work.
[08:04.43]Stick to the major storefronts if you want me to do a PC game.
[08:09.58]because I've been trying to get Casino Inc and the movies to work.
[08:12.77]There's an era of Windows 98, Windows XP,
[08:17.07]that is just such a pain in the ass to get to work, even with emulation, even with tweaks.
[08:22.25]I'm doing it right now, it's a pain in the ass.
[08:24.90]So...
[08:26.60]let's keep let's say like 2005 or something right like as of 2005 forward
[08:33.66]If there's a game that released in 2003 and it's on Steam and it works, that's fine.
[08:39.65]But you know what I'm saying?
[08:40.94]Get rid of the Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows XP shit.
[08:45.11]If you want me to play Captain Crunch's cereal box game that came out in 1993,
[08:52.24]Okay, I want to do that, but let's not do that for this.
[08:56.80]Because that's a great game, and I'm ready to play that, but I gotta get that ready.
[09:01.36]Yeah, make sure it works easily on something.
[09:04.37]So there you go.
[09:06.19]Here's another thing here too, and I have to make this rule because if I don't make this rule, then some of you will corroborate and immediately, just listen.
[09:16.65]If the person that submitted the video does not respond today,
[09:22.90]If you're not here, or within the next five business days after this stream,
[09:30.00]You're just deleted.
[09:31.67]There is no choice.
[09:33.02]It's gone.
[09:35.05]And the reason why I'm doing that, I'm not going to put it into a pool.
[09:37.76]I'm not going to be like, oh, then we can all vote on it, because here's why.
[09:41.68]a bunch of you guys that get this.
[09:45.58]If I laugh, by the way, I have to laugh, which, good luck.
[09:49.39]If a bunch of you get this and all decide that you're not going to...
[09:54.34]You're just like, no, no, no, no, just don't say anything.
[09:57.33]Then it'll go to the pool and then we can vote on
[10:01.36]I don't know, he'll have to play Deltarune for a whole stream, right?
[10:04.11]You know what I'm saying?
[10:05.16]No corroborations.
[10:06.55]But...
[10:07.95]Here's the thing.
[10:09.20]If more than one person does say the same game, within the next five business days,
[10:15.58]They can choose to either add time to the game by an increment of 30 minutes, or choose another game.
[10:25.54]Which means I would be streaming it for an hour.
[10:31.78]Should I just ban Deltarune?
[10:33.11]No, I can't do that.
[10:33.75]That's not how it works.
[10:35.09]If you... Why did I even say that?
[10:37.00]Now if I'm... Whatever.
[10:37.96]You gotta make me laugh, bro.
[10:39.58]Also...
[10:44.57]Forget about all that now.
[10:46.86]If I laugh at more than three videos,
[10:52.49]on the fourth video.
[10:53.85]It's got to be per video, right?
[10:55.58]On the fourth video.
[10:58.75]And each laugh after that
[11:02.53]will unlock a new emote for the channel.
[11:05.72]And these emotes will be chosen by a poll in a future stream, depending on how many laughs after three.
[11:11.08]I'll give a list of ideas, and chat can vote on the ones they want to see.
[11:15.65]And I will get them made.
[11:20.09]So if I laugh four times, that's one emote.
[11:23.13]Five times, that's two emotes.
[11:25.97]So on and so forth.
[11:27.92]And that's per video, by the way.
[11:30.10]If I laugh at the same video like ten times, that's not nine emotes.
[11:35.72]You get it?
[11:40.20]You see, then somebody put it in quotes, retired.
[11:44.11]I can do whatever I want when I'm retired.
[11:45.88]I can do anything I want.
[11:48.37]Alright.
[11:49.11]Do you understand the rules?
[11:53.51]You're gonna get 50 new emotes.
[11:54.95]I have to...
[11:55.44]Okay, I'm already laughing about nothing.
[11:59.52]Alright, let me get it out.
[12:01.06]Oh!
[12:03.01]After we do this, it's going to be about maybe like a two hour segment today.
[12:07.82]We're gonna move on.
[12:09.39]I'm gonna take like a five to ten minute break in between.
[12:11.62]And I'm going to make a clay creature.
[12:16.66]I'll be very honest with you.
[12:19.23]I have not really been doing this that recently.
[12:21.60]I've been really out of practice.
[12:24.55]We're just going to see what happens.
[12:26.62]I got my setup.
[12:27.44]I got all the little tools and everything.
[12:28.98]We're just going to make something and I'm not going to paint it.
[12:31.87]So it's just going to be the kind of default textureless, whatever it is.
[12:36.39]It was a good place to chill.
[12:39.12]Give me a chill day.
[12:40.27]After this.
[12:42.22]Okay, do we all understand the rules?
[12:48.18]Okay.
[12:49.15]If you understand the rules, repeat them back to me.
[12:53.95]I would like you to recite it back to me, please.
[13:02.26]I don't give a fuck.
[13:04.18]Get out of my classroom.
[13:06.55]You're fired from my class.
[13:09.30]Can you do that?
[13:09.78]Can you fire a student?
[13:15.76]You're expelled from my class.
[13:20.49]Expelled implies expelled from the whole school.
[13:23.20]Can you expel somebody from a singular class?
[13:27.40]Alright, you guys ready?
[13:28.85]I'm ready.
[13:32.50]By the way, we allowed TikTok and Instagram this time.
[13:37.33]So I'm going to do it by platform.
[13:39.78]So we're going to start on TikTok.
[13:41.78]There are, I believe, about 40 videos on TikTok.
[13:46.22]Then there's like, I think, 20 or 30 on Instagram.
[13:51.88]And then there's like a hundred something on YouTube.
[13:56.64]Are you guys ready?
[13:59.91]Let me go over the rules again.
[14:01.76]So, if I laugh at a video... No, no, no, you already get it.
[14:04.84]I'm fucking around.
[14:06.60]If I laugh at a video, we'll get in touch with you through Twitch.
[14:10.84]We have your username.
[14:11.75]We know whose video is whose.
[14:14.16]Within five days, you got to get a response.
[14:16.79]We got to get a response from you.
[14:19.00]What game do you want me to play?
[14:20.07]I want, oh dude, this one for the N64.
[14:22.08]No, dude, no, I want you to play this.
[14:24.43]It's on Steam and it's so good.
[14:26.33]No porn.
[14:27.91]No porn.
[14:28.94]Or porn likes, okay?
[14:30.66]There's porn likes, too.
[14:32.75]None of those.
[14:34.85]It's gotta be TOS-friendly on Twitch.
[14:37.50]Don't be an idiot.
[14:45.53]I have to be able to stream this and not have a Twitch admin come in here and be like, bro, what the fuck are you doing?
[14:53.66]Good.
[14:55.00]Alright, are we ready to begin?
[15:12.46]Yes.
[15:15.05]Yes.
[15:16.73]Is that a yes?
[15:21.81]Good.
[15:23.82]Good morning.
[15:26.43]Good afternoon.
[15:28.58]Okay.
[15:30.27]This might be a small spoiler.
[15:34.40]I need to shave.
[15:35.10]I know.
[15:35.43]I don't give a shit what you say about my face.
[15:38.68]But don't be mean about it, okay?
[15:40.63]Alright, you ready?
[15:45.76]I'm just going to go for it.
[15:53.78]You look mean.
[15:55.98]Stop calling me Morbius.
[16:04.79]Or I'll get angry and fangs will come out of my fucking teeth.
[16:08.47]I'm ready.
[16:09.46]I'm ready to go.
[16:10.26]The audio should be there.
[16:11.37]I don't know how loud these are.
[16:13.62]So be prepared.
[16:14.56]I have it turned down slightly.
[16:17.75]Okay, I'm ready.
[16:23.76]Remember, if I laugh at your submission, I'm going to play your N64 game that you had when you were a child and when you grew up.
[16:29.34]Remember that game that you played for the fucking...
[16:34.37]Switch?
[16:37.50]Alright, here we go.
[16:38.57]I'm just going to let them go.
[16:42.47]Oh, how are we deciding if you lose?
[16:44.99]I was thinking about, I saw Vinny one time had a panel.
[16:49.98]If it's debatable,
[16:52.89]And I'm going to, look, I'm going to be, I'll be very honest.
[16:55.72]And plus my noise gate's a little bit off today.
[16:58.65]I'm going to be very honest.
[16:59.59]It's going to be very obvious.
[17:02.08]I'll be honest.
[17:03.95]If it's debatable, then we could put it to a moderator vote.
[17:13.52]Whoever the mods that are here right now can vote.
[17:18.08]Okay.
[17:30.40]Okay.
[17:32.82]That's how you know my noise gate is off.
[17:34.27]See, I told you.
[17:39.21]Bye.
[17:46.37]Bye.
[17:49.25]Hi.
[18:01.53]The nostrils flaring almost got me.
[18:05.49]It was pretty close.
[18:14.26]So,
[18:30.32]Happy birthday to you.
[18:32.01]Happy birthday to you.
[18:39.72]Oh, God.
[18:48.58]I love you.
[18:53.82]I wish I could have been with you.
[18:57.15]I'll see you later.
[18:58.14]I have a little gift for you.
[19:00.11]Enjoy your day with your friends, Mommy.
[19:02.56]I love you.
[19:03.28]It's happy.
[19:04.73]Bye, mi amor.
[19:06.22]Happy birthday.
[19:12.64]That was good.
[19:13.53]That was good.
[19:13.87]That was close.
[19:14.59]But it was good.
[19:16.58]It was... Let me take a second here.
[19:21.62]That was cute.
[19:22.25]Yeah.
[19:27.02]What's wrong with this water?
[19:28.87]Okay, are there rules where can I...
[19:32.26]The video is no longer playing.
[19:33.88]Can I talk and laugh?
[19:36.01]I can laugh, right?
[19:37.35]Can I, like, laugh right now?
[19:41.85]Yeah, alright, alright, alright, I'm good.
[19:44.91]That was a cute one, though.
[19:46.95]Get it out of your system.
[19:47.80]I don't know what I'm doing.
[19:51.34]That's how you get a laugh out of you.
[19:52.55]Alright.
[20:00.47]Thank you.
[20:10.21]Thank you.
[20:23.84]To me is the text that pops up.
[20:36.31]You think that's on purpose?
[20:39.98]You think that was on purpose?
[20:40.70]It was on purpose, right?
[20:41.24]It had to be.
[20:43.04]Why is it only Russian and Jerma?
[20:44.61]That's what I was going to say.
[20:46.88]That popping up two or three times is what I thought was the funniest part.
[20:50.65]The last one is definitely on purpose, yeah.
[20:53.93]Okay.
[21:24.94]That was a cute one.
[21:26.17]That was cute.
[21:43.27]Ooh.
[21:56.43]I need more effort.
[21:57.46]I need more effort, you know.
[22:00.58]Oh.
[22:06.17]Right there, so close.
[22:14.62]Like he could just get it right now.
[22:36.71]No, it was the, oh shit, man.
[22:39.41]This whole video was fine, but then like the, oh shit.
[22:50.03]It's the fucking taped microphone too.
[22:52.15]What the hell, man?
[22:56.42]It's the length of this one that was the problem because, oh, it's funny for like the first two or three times and then dog is just kind of still doing it.
[23:05.05]Even when, the dog almost just knows.
[23:07.32]The dog's like, fuck you, man.
[23:08.97]Like, fuck off.
[23:12.54]He's like, I know what you're going to do.
[23:14.03]You're going to do that thing.
[23:14.97]And it's pissing me off.
[23:15.71]He didn't even need to close his hand.
[23:16.92]Oh man.
[23:19.27]Alright.
[23:19.61]Well,
[23:21.75]That was Fatso underscore Catso who submitted that.
[23:28.82]That wasn't even a funny one.
[23:30.85]What do you want me to tell you?
[23:31.94]It was the guy talking.
[23:34.41]I wasn't prepared for the guy to say anything.
[23:38.26]It's just so stupid.
[23:40.91]Alright, Fatso Catso, you have five days to get in touch with the moderator to tell me what game you'd like me to play on stream.
[23:49.17]And for those of you that are just joining us,
[23:50.90]Whoa, that's a long explanation.
[23:54.69]Go to the beginning of the stream and read the rules.

[28:54.22]What's almost getting me is I thought the guy was going like this.
[28:58.30]Like, yeah!
[29:04.15]I thought he was doing the let's rock on.
[29:11.08]Kind of looked like she was doing the...
[29:12.69]It's a bit more on TikTok right now.
[29:15.40]You know when people do the over-animated face videos?
[29:19.89]Where they do like the...
[29:21.07]It kind of looks like that.
[29:24.98]Fix your webcam?
[29:25.72]What's wrong with my webcam?
[29:29.49]You don't like how I'm lit today?
[29:31.98]Has to be like that for the clay section.
[29:37.74]You look evil?
[29:38.62]Well, whatever.
[29:41.51]I look too sick.
[29:42.35]Well, whatever.
[29:42.81]I got a beard today.
[29:44.10]Okay.
[29:44.32]Here we go.
[30:03.09]Who is doing that?
[30:05.78]That guy?
[30:07.97]Or is it added in after?
[30:15.17]It kind of looks like he's doing it.
[30:20.91]Okay, surprising my boyfriend for his birthday.
[30:33.55]Heaven When I held you again
[30:44.86]It's so stupid.
[30:47.80]Fuck!
[30:51.76]Why is your dog just a statue?
[30:54.38]It's almost like someone's holding a tree up here.
[30:56.75]This is on purpose.
[30:57.82]This is on purpose.
[30:59.04]They fucked up this for the video.
[31:00.81]None of this matters.
[31:02.00]Oh, he's surprising your boyfriend for his birthday.
[31:03.51]No, you're not.
[31:04.33]Your boyfriend's standing behind the camera with a dog treat to make the dog sit like this, like looking like a fucking lunatic.
[31:10.90]That's the point of this video.
[31:14.46]Look at the reflection.
[31:16.01]That makes it even funnier.
[31:22.69]What is wrong with him?
[31:28.88]What is wrong with him?
[31:31.21]Why are you doing that?
[31:38.65]Oh, okay.
[31:40.09]Well, whatever.
[31:42.05]The dog ones, no, the dog ones are not a weakness.
[31:45.62]It's, I mean, they kind of are.

[32:05.96]You get the rules.
[32:07.65]You have five days to respond.
[32:12.35]The fact that nobody's... That's so weird.
[32:15.20]What a weird dog.
[32:16.29]Okay, let's go.
[32:19.82]I want one more time.
[32:21.25]One more time.
[32:23.96]Okay.
[32:34.07]I like that one a lot.

[32:40.28]Okay, we made beans after this.
[32:43.52]Okay ready?
[32:51.09]Okay ready?
[32:56.67]It's definitely fake.
[32:57.74]It's definitely fake.
[33:00.48]That's...
[33:05.36]I can't look at chat during this.
[33:07.95]I can't look at chat.
[33:12.85]So it just said drunk and it fucked up everything.
[33:15.85]God damn it.
[33:18.02]Okay.
[33:21.90]Does that count?
[33:22.78]I looked at chat and somebody said, it was all lowercase, just said drunk.
[33:26.99]It fucked it all up.
[33:28.54]It changed the video.
[33:31.31]Ugh.
[33:34.08]I think it's a fake video.
[33:37.61]And I knew today was a bad day to do this because I'm already, I was in a giggly ass mood earlier.
[33:43.31]And I said, this is a bad day to do this.
[33:49.17]Okay.
[33:50.47]That was Marmalade013.
[33:53.22]Marmalade013, congratulations.
[33:56.44]A video game of your choice.
[33:57.82]Go read the rules.
[33:59.03]30 minutes, I'll play a game that you want me to play of any console that released in North America.
[34:08.27]Easy clap.
[34:09.47]Yeah.
[34:10.26]Or on Steam or GOG or whatever.
[34:13.09]There's a whole rules I said at the beginning.
[34:15.74]Alright.
[34:16.29]We're almost through the TikTok ones.
[34:17.50]There's another, I want to say seven or eight of these, maybe a little bit more.
[34:21.02]Here we go.
[34:31.30]Whoa.
[34:32.85]Okay.
[34:33.01]He on a roll.
[34:40.08]Ready.
[34:45.36]I see the vision.
[34:54.73]We've got a poke clip here.
[34:57.45]Just lock in.
[35:01.90]I'm not thinking because of the save states.
[35:03.29]I'm relying on the save states too much.
[35:04.48]I'm not really using critical thinking here like I should.
[35:21.89]It's the fucking animation.
[35:23.67]Why would he not jump after he lands?
[35:30.82]It's not real.
[35:32.01]It's not real.
[35:33.54]It's not.
[35:34.52]It's the camera angle.
[35:35.55]It's the fucking camera.
[35:36.72]It's not me.
[35:39.49]That was a tough one.
[35:41.88]That was tough.
[35:42.73]That was a hard one.
[35:44.07]I'm not thinking because of the save states.
[35:45.44]I'm relying on the save states too much.
[35:46.92]I was good up until the very end when he
[35:50.04]He does the thing you do in these old 2D games where you just sort of, I'm just going to jump as far as I fucking can to the right of the screen and
[35:58.11]Dear God, I just hope there's something that I land on.
[36:02.20]I've been there a million times.
[36:05.79]That was great.
[36:06.37]That was a good one.
[36:07.39]That was close.
[36:14.83]It's not real.
[36:15.66]It's not real.
[36:16.29]Was the thing face?
[36:17.58]Yeah, it was.
[36:54.62]That was close, because that was a dog, and I didn't laugh.
[36:57.13]I didn't think the dog necessarily was funny, but the dog kind of looks like a guy.
[37:03.59]You know what I'm saying?
[37:06.35]Okay.
[37:10.23]That's quite a title.
[37:12.88]What you doing, huh?
[37:20.17]Okay.
[37:22.11]Hey, Riley.
[37:23.06]What you doing, huh?
[37:31.92]Do you think I scared my car salesman?
[37:46.04]You want me to turn it up?
[37:47.00]Go for it.
[37:59.37]That's some crazy movements.
[38:01.29]That's some crazy movements.
[38:14.88]What is that?
[38:17.35]What animal is this?
[38:18.22]Is this a weird World of Warcraft?
[38:21.50]What is this?
[38:26.95]It's a fucking dinosaur!
[38:41.56]Now Neil, don't get angry with it, Neil.
[38:45.07]You've already broke it.
[38:46.36]I thought he burped.
[38:51.84]Oh, thank God he didn't burp.
[38:53.22]Thank God it wasn't a burp.
[38:55.95]It was confirmed almost immediately that it wasn't a huge burp.
[39:04.00]Okay.
[39:05.43]Okay.
[39:13.44]It's drunk.
[39:14.67]It's not drunk.
[39:16.60]That doesn't work here.
[39:25.43]A wise man once said, the highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up and say, I can do whatever I want today.
[39:34.78]I'm gonna tell you how you can manifest that reality.
[39:39.14]As soon as you wake up every single morning, I want you to relax.
[39:42.92]Don't grab your phone.
[39:44.00]Don't move.
[39:45.38]Close your eyes and visualize your life.
[39:49.42]Visualize your day.
[39:55.54]What the fuck, dude?
[40:00.53]to wake up and say I can I always got to the end of the video
[40:05.90]This is not good for you.
[40:10.16]This is not healthy.
[40:12.53]This is incredibly unhealthy.
[40:15.13]I think it's the hair.
[40:19.47]No, it's got to be some fucking white balancing, right?
[40:23.61]There's got to be white balancing on it.
[40:26.83]Alright, I got to lock in.
[40:27.97]This is, this is four in the, and there's only been like 30 videos.
[40:31.41]This is like a dumbest, this is like almost 10% laugh ratio.
[40:34.52]Looks like a Dark Souls character.
[40:39.68]He looks like every Dark Souls character made by anybody that streams on this platform.
[40:48.00]If you are a Twitch streamer, it doesn't matter where you are, if you're a streamer, that's the character that you have.
[40:56.68]Oh my god.
[41:01.60]That's so fucked up.
[41:02.67]That's so unhealthy.
[41:04.32]Hope you're alright, dude.
[41:05.32]Don't do that that much.
[41:06.63]Be careful of your blood vessels and your blood pressure, dude.
[41:11.88]Yeah, and the guy on the right is an NPC?
[41:14.80]Yeah.
[41:16.76]Ugh.
[41:17.80]This outfit's fucking awesome, by the way.
[41:21.22]Look at this outfit.
[41:24.15]There's a lot going on in this one, but that was...
[41:27.46]That was Mike Horse.
[41:29.49]Mike Horse, congratulations.
[41:30.77]I'll play any game of your choice for 30 minutes on a future live stream, and we will figure that out.
[41:36.21]Read the rules.
[41:39.51]I have to lock in though because we're like maybe not we're like just about a third of the way through this and we're like 25 of the way through this and I've laughed four times already that's not good
[41:49.83]Alright.
[41:50.52]Three powerful reasons to pause when you speak.
[41:52.47]Important because when you pause, you give the other person time to process what you've said.
[41:58.61]I just shit my pants.
[42:36.21]I'm thinking about that red guy again.
[42:50.03]Pausing is so important.
[42:52.28]I'm thinking about that red pressure phase thing.

[45:49.14]I feel like I could destroy this challenge.
[45:51.81]So when it pops up, you're supposed to say the word and whatever is there, I could destroy this.
[45:57.59]I might actually get a near perfect score.
[46:00.85]Maybe I'll do that one day.
[46:02.50]I'll be on that for like an hour.
[46:04.17]I can't do it right now.
[46:13.51]I'm easy like Sunday morning.
[46:24.79]I'm easy
[46:30.95]It's engulfed in flames.
[46:33.76]That's crazy.
[46:49.82]I just imagine this girl freaking out.
[46:58.76]We're good.
[47:03.61]Oh god.
[47:08.16]Oh, what have I done to merit these cruel sufferings?
[47:16.96]Oh, what have I done to merit these cruel sufferings?
[47:25.75]Oh, what have I done to merit these cruel...
[47:34.98]I wonder where this is.
[47:36.10]Oh, it's a dog one.
[47:40.90]Is that the theme today that I'm going to laugh at?
[47:47.45]Ahem.
[47:59.46]We're good.
[48:01.58]It's just a weird looking dog.
[48:18.72]What?
[48:55.34]Is this a rat?
[48:58.61]There is a rat.
[49:04.06]Hi, it's 9.58.
[49:06.92]Can I still order?
[49:07.94]Oh, yeah, of course.
[49:08.50]What can I get for you?
[49:11.84]I hate doing this.
[49:12.30]Can I have two large cheese pizzas, please?
[49:14.67]Yeah, of course.
[49:19.91]Ten veggie pockets.
[49:25.66]and uh three buffalo mac and cheese pizzas anything else for you
[49:35.18]Uh, can I have, uh, ten mozzarella sticks and some papa bites, please?
[49:41.86]Ten mozzarella sticks and some papa bites.
[49:45.25]That'll do it.
[49:51.70]I...
[49:52.36]Okay, anytime I order from any place ever, I always say...
[49:57.00]I got to go.
[49:57.90]I'm going 30 minutes before they close.
[49:59.33]To me, the restaurant closes.
[50:01.60]Let's say they close at 9.
[50:04.11]They close at 8.30.
[50:06.63]For me.
[50:08.38]I just, I know, you know, I never went, because if I, oh man, it's a 10 minutes to close, five minutes to close.
[50:13.31]If it's an incredibly easy item,
[50:15.58]Maybe, right?
[50:16.84]If we're talking about, if you're going into like a McDonald's or a Burger King, whatever, as a...
[50:21.23]Are there wrapped up Big Macs just sitting there that it's closing in like 10 minutes?
[50:27.73]Because I'll take a Big Mac if that's there, right?
[50:31.22]But I'm so...
[50:34.26]I just don't want to do that.
[50:35.90]I feel like it's just so awful.
[50:38.19]I think 15 minutes is kind of, I'm like, alright, what is being made in 15 minutes?
[50:46.41]But usually it's about 30, like 25-ish minutes.
[50:50.51]15 is questionable.
[50:51.65]15 is questionable, but depending on the order.
[50:55.67]but I hate doing that.
[50:56.67]I always feel like so awful if I ever even come close.
[51:10.49]Ha ha ha ha ha!
[51:19.01]What would cause this?
[51:34.45]Three, two, one, go.
[51:53.69]Three, two, one, go.
[52:02.70]I don't think I could do that as an adult.
[52:08.17]I feel like if you set me up here, I would probably miss a few of these.
[52:13.79]That's the end of the TikToks.
[52:16.71]We have a small amount of Instagram reels to get through.
[52:19.36]And then we have one large YouTube playlist to get through.
[52:25.06]So that is it for the TikToks.
[52:27.93]We opened up TikTok this year.
[52:29.11]And hey, I have three of those or four of those.
[52:32.48]How many have got me so far?
[52:34.19]Four?
[52:35.71]Have I already laughed four times?
[52:42.79]Shit.
[52:43.34]Okay, so that's...
[52:43.98]Okay.
[52:45.33]So there's one new emote, at least.
[52:47.62]Right?
[52:47.80]That's a new emote coming in.
[52:51.84]And then we got four 30 minute game segments.
[52:56.95]I'm going to, because a lot of people have trickled in in the last 20, 30 minutes, let me just very quickly say what's going on.
[53:02.53]People submitted clips, and if I pick your clip,
[53:06.59]Well, no, if I laugh at your...
[53:08.20]I guess it's the same thing.
[53:09.67]If I laugh at a clip that you submitted...
[53:12.53]Uh, you get to make me play any game you want for 30 minutes on stream.
[53:17.38]And...
[53:17.96]as long as it's on a major console or it's not porn you know read the rules
[53:24.05]Alright, let me switch over to the Instagram stuff.
[53:28.28]I should have it right here.
[53:33.71]And we will just keep rolling.
[53:36.88]Instagram Reels.
[53:40.28]I don't think there are very many of these.
[53:41.24]I think there's like maybe 30 of these, 20 of these total.
[53:45.92]Should be ready.
[53:49.12]And here we go.
[53:51.72]Make sure the audio is good too.

[54:54.69]Hover over them.
[54:56.50]What?

[57:40.33]I've seen this video before and I was like, that's awesome.
[57:46.88]Yeah, no shit.
[57:48.67]No shit I've seen this video before because my girlfriend is the one that submitted this.
[57:53.29]That's from Holly.
[57:55.35]She showed this to me like, okay.
[57:57.18]Alright, Holly, what do you want me to play?

[58:45.95]I despise this fucking house, man.
[58:48.64]Oh, I love it is a great video.
[58:55.41]I'm Randy Shithorse, founder of OK Clowns, and our clowns are different, way better.

[59:03.12]Jesus.
[59:14.09]way better our clowns hate balloon animal they hate hawk
[59:32.47]Oh.
[59:38.63]Have you been wronged by Randy Shithorse and his clowns?
[59:41.29]Did you hire them?
[59:41.83]Is this guy again?
[59:42.54]All they did was take a big nap.
[59:43.62]in your son's bed and then lay face down in the bounce castle so your kids had to jump on their backs crazy style those clowns I'll fight for you
[59:53.73]Have you been wronged by Randy Shithorse and his cl- Bye!
[59:59.11]Oh, those are AI?
[60:00.30]Okay, we tried to filter, so we had a rule for no AI videos?
[60:04.46]uh but you know trying to filter all of them out potentially as uh is difficult so yeah I if one or two slip through then it's all good but
[60:15.65]A lot of videos.
[60:16.84]There was like a thousand submissions.
[60:19.45]So.
[60:21.78]Was it AI?
[60:22.91]That's why it's so fucked up, man.
[60:24.13]It's getting harder to tell these days.
[60:31.26]Yeah.
[60:34.00]It's getting harder to tell, but it's all good.
[60:36.75]Don't worry.
[60:37.75]We filtered out, I would say, probably 99.9% of all of them.
[60:42.57]If one or two got through, then it's all good.
[60:46.05]It's okay.
[60:55.41]Oh no!
[61:05.35]That's when the now worked.
[61:27.10]What... is this?
[61:36.79]Hmm.
[61:38.80]I would have laughed five times at this if I wasn't just so confused by what the fuck this is.
[61:42.63]Oh no.
[61:46.57]That's when the now worked.
[61:48.32]Robot Alchemic Drive.
[61:53.38]I feel like I've seen a clip from this from somewhere else too.
[61:59.59]What a weird game.
[62:09.00]Why there's so much blood?
[62:25.25]Okay.
[62:26.64]So I go to, uh, the way for, uh, I have job part and you just jump in the middle of it.
[62:32.38]And we are, uh,
[62:33.37]over the mountains to the beaches.
[62:37.05]And I talked to the manager.
[62:38.51]She said, no, you're not.
[62:39.46]It's not him.
[62:40.18]And you owe me such much money.
[62:41.57]So I go to the way for a motel.
[62:44.72]I have Joe Hart and you can just jump in from the middle there.
[62:47.47]And we are...
[62:49.08]Dude, the hat, the hat just kind of warps.
[62:53.15]What is going on in this video?
[63:08.52]Watching the hat just kind of go...
[63:21.77]the fuck is going on?
[63:31.81]It's like a modded GTA server.
[63:38.54]What goes down here?
[63:47.67]Come on.
[63:53.98]Thanks for watching!
[64:01.36]Okay.
[64:11.09]Ugh!
[64:15.59]Ugh!
[64:29.01]Thank you.
[64:37.18]Oh, they're getting cropped?
[64:38.17]Oh, because I took away... Yeah, because some of these are a little bit bigger.
[64:43.47]So for our next watch, we need...
[64:46.18]We're gonna have to deal with comments for a little bit.
[64:55.14]to decide whether to make the clock analog or digital.
[64:58.23]I'm leaning towards digital.
[64:59.64]Would analog be better?
[65:00.69]Yeah, it looks nice, and I don't know...
[65:03.13]Wood analog.
[65:04.98]So for our next watch, we need to decide whether to make the clock analog or digital.
[65:09.27]I'm leaning towards digital.
[65:10.68]Would analog be better?
[65:11.70]It kind of looks nice, and I don't know.
[65:13.12]you
[65:31.79]Is this, is somebody in there?
[65:33.94]What the fuck?
[65:52.53]It doesn't count.
[65:53.21]I looked at chat.
[65:54.24]We were out of the video.
[65:55.87]We were out of the video.
[65:58.25]It doesn't count because it had nothing to do with the video.
[66:01.95]We were done with the video.
[66:02.70]I didn't laugh at the video.
[66:04.22]I looked at chat and chat, somebody in chat said,
[66:11.39]Chad said, time machine.
[66:13.78]It's like, what dude?
[66:16.11]It actually kind of looks like somebody's traveling to the fucking dark ages in that thing.
[66:19.97]Somebody's coming back in time.
[66:23.64]Does it count?
[66:24.71]No, it doesn't count.
[66:25.45]It doesn't count.
[66:26.28]That person said time machine.
[66:32.10]Should we get a mod vote on that one?
[66:35.10]I was out of the video.
[66:37.65]and now we were done with it and we're at the seal eating this fish and so I looked over and somebody said time machine and it just it created a domino effect in my brain
[66:57.16]Doesn't count.
[66:57.70]Doesn't count.
[66:58.71]I think the mod consensus over here is it did not count.
[67:02.07]Doesn't count.
[67:02.41]Doesn't count.
[67:02.85]Okay.
[67:05.97]Alright, who submitted it?
[67:11.60]Who submitted it?
[67:19.38]Here's what I'll do.
[67:22.14]And who said time machine?
[67:26.47]Yeah, the clip was from Ace, Ace Lijah.
[67:30.49]Ace Lijah.
[67:32.63]And who said Time Machine?
[67:41.00]The first person to say time machine.
[67:47.00]Maybe, maybe we'll do a thing where they can, uh, the two of them can figure it out.
[67:52.41]15 minutes for each of them.
[67:57.20]If we can find the first person that said time machine, then maybe we'll, the two of you can kind of work it out.
[68:02.82]Cause that was really funny.
[68:04.89]It was not, the video was crazy, but that was what really threw it over the edge.
[68:09.74]Check the VOD later.
[68:10.54]Okay.
[68:10.81]Yeah.
[68:10.97]We'll figure it out.
[68:13.84]I'm being told that that's probably impossible.
[68:19.25]So that may be not possible.
[68:28.01]We'll see.
[68:32.06]Wait, we may have found it.
[68:35.05]Hey, a frozen potato.
[68:36.68]Did you say it first?
[68:37.66]You said it, right?
[68:38.52]You the first person to say it?
[68:40.89]We'll figure it out.
[68:48.21]Alright.
[68:58.95]Yeah, that's good.
[69:13.80]Oh my goodness.
[69:20.80]No!
[69:29.93]Even at the end, I wanted it.
[69:36.59]It is the only way.

[70:24.92]I'm putting nothing in the tub, guys.
[70:26.57]I'm getting lightheaded, man.
[70:29.70]What makes this almost for me is the fact that his hands are just...
[70:35.65]It's like, you know, we're not doing that.
[70:37.25]We're just going to do the face.

[77:34.67]I guess.
[77:40.90]I love it.
[77:41.56]That was funny.
[78:14.44]One of my favorite things about, it feels like a lot of the younger generation is
[78:26.38]It's just kind of being a little inquisitive.
[78:28.88]Just looking at the world a little differently.
[78:30.63]Something curious maxing.
[78:33.30]You know what I'm saying?
[78:34.83]Curious maxing.
[78:36.15]Oh, you know, I gotta go get my eyes checked.

[79:10.82]It's satire?
[79:11.68]I don't know.
[79:11.98]That's fine.
[79:13.23]It just doesn't mean that the whole generation doesn't say it.
[79:17.57]I like it.
[79:17.84]I think it's funny.

[82:41.20]It's not going to get me, but it's just crazy.
[82:47.62]This intro is so...
[82:52.57]This is a crazy video.
[83:06.04]I let him use my pen and he just started floating and doing flips.
[83:10.00]I did get it off of Timu though.
[83:11.33]Nothing wrong with my friend.
[83:13.16]I let him use my pen, and he just started floating and doing flips.
[83:16.39]I did get it off of Timu, though.
[83:17.68]Not going to get anything wrong with my friend.
[83:22.22]I think that's the end of the Instagram reels.
[83:26.51]Wait, was there one more?
[83:33.85]Okay, there's a couple more.
[83:35.44]There's four more.
[83:40.43]Uh-oh.
[83:46.37]I wanted to see if you think this is- I don't think that video exists anymore.
[83:54.08]Okay, I can't open this video for some weird reason, but I could open this one.
[83:58.67]Weird.
[84:02.65]Oh, wow.
[84:12.86]He's really going for it.
[84:25.72]I wanted to see if you think this is too much.

[84:34.22]What's it for?
[84:34.92]That's a mess.
[84:35.28]Margaret Ann's 108th birthday, but she's got a bit of a heart condition.
[84:38.29]I wanted to-
[84:38.61]I didn't want to have to say this today, but apparently it's something you need to hear.
[84:46.43]You're a beautiful young black woman who was born gay.
[84:51.71]Dad, we're almost out of paper towels.
[84:54.18]What?
[85:00.23]I was probably the first person ever
[85:07.01]I consulted the microlithic cuboid of ancient luminous wisdom.
[85:11.54]And it said to me... Y'all got to get the fuck up out of here and leave!
[85:17.66]Now!
[85:21.44]Just gonna make sure your baby's okay.

[86:00.47]It's cheating.
[86:08.73]Okay, apparently... Oh, the bot's got the links here.
[86:13.45]Let me get them up, hold on.
[86:19.36]Because I couldn't open them here, but I will try to do it here.
[86:25.10]Alright, there's one.
[86:38.71]And here's the other one.
[86:39.82]Okay.
[86:48.48]alright here we go should be able to see it now
[87:00.04]Fucked up shit going on!
[87:04.17]Fucked up shit going on!
[87:08.50]Whoa, it's all fucked up!
[87:13.46]It's all fucked up shit!
[87:20.71]Fucked up shit going on!
[87:24.60]Fucked up shit going on!
[87:26.30]Alright.
[87:36.44]ditch the glasses and go straight into LASIK, this is how we do it in three simple steps.
[87:41.43]Completely painless, we're gonna be removing
[87:43.28]the top layer of your cornea.
[87:44.84]You won't feel it at all.
[87:46.03]I'm going to go in with some lasers and this is basically a computer
[87:49.81]adjusting your eyes for me it's it's so easy it's so reliably safe and effective uh you're gonna love it the flap's gonna go all the way back on there
[87:58.36]and we are not going to be using stitches because the eye is so resilient.
[88:01.60]It's really quite amazing.
[88:02.90]I will, however, be putting a little bit of saline
[88:05.21]And because you're vulnerable and you're going to be unable to move, I will take a pee in your eye.
[88:09.67]It's going to get infected, irritated.
[88:11.18]I'm going to be then taking a poop in your eye.
[88:14.38]So that eye is done, you're never gonna see again.
[88:17.56]This eye actually though, it's fine, unscathed, we haven't touched it yet.
[88:21.92]I might skip the lasers, actually.
[88:23.47]We're just going to scoop this one out, and I'm allowed to keep them in a little jar legally.
[88:27.51]This was your eye before.
[88:28.75]And you're going to be leaving like that.
[88:31.39]So if you come into my office, this is what I'm going to be doing now.
[88:34.74]I'm sick of my job.
[88:35.85]I'm sick of the bullshit.
[88:36.97]Let me fuck you up.
[88:38.26]Hey guys, welcome back.
[88:39.34]If you want to ditch the glasses and go straight...
[88:44.22]Okay, we're good.
[88:46.36]Alright.
[88:48.20]That's it for Instagram.
[88:50.52]So what do we got for a full tally here before we get to the meat?
[88:54.24]There's the big one.
[88:55.16]The YouTube playlist is a big one.
[88:58.02]It's going to be probably like another 40 minutes of just YouTube.
[89:06.35]We got seven times.
[89:10.42]Needed seven hee-hees.
[89:14.63]So that's four emotes.
[89:18.42]Okay.
[89:19.50]I actually really have to lock in because I don't know.
[89:21.70]We're going to add, what, 10 more emotes maybe?
[89:31.51]Seven times, that's fine.
[89:33.52]Easy.
[89:34.97]Alright, let's move over to YouTube.
[89:39.24]And you should see it in a second.
[89:42.87]These are going to be pretty rapid fire.
[89:44.50]Unfortunately, these cannot replay.
[89:47.14]like the other ones because those are reels and they just kind of doot, doot, doot.
[89:51.76]So this is a playlist.
[89:53.45]So we're going to be going through this probably pretty quickly.
[89:55.90]I will stop if I need to.
[89:59.24]Let me take a drink.
[90:08.08]Okay, I'm going to shrink my camera, because these are going to be full screened.
[90:13.90]But not too crazy.
[90:27.27]How's that?
[90:32.36]You wanna take a break?
[90:34.63]Oh, it's been like an hour and a half.
[90:35.93]Yeah, okay.
[90:36.53]We'll take a quick break.
[90:37.80]That's true.
[90:39.12]When we come back, we got probably about 45 minutes of this.
[90:42.84]This YouTube playlist is going to just play.
[90:46.69]Yeah, I'll be right back.
[90:48.20]Good idea.
[90:49.30]I need to pee.
[90:49.90]Now that you say it.
[90:55.60]Where?
[90:55.78]There we go.
[90:57.63]Hold on.
[90:58.55]Okay.
[91:01.25]See you in like two or three minutes.
[95:02.92]Hello.
[95:04.91]How's it going?
[95:07.26]I have returned.
[95:07.96]And...
[95:12.24]I'm ready to sit through a YouTube playlist.
[95:15.61]And again, I cannot make these play again very easily.
[95:20.60]I mean, I can if I need to.
[95:22.23]But the goal is to, I'm just going to go.
[95:25.40]Playlist, it's just going to happen.
[95:28.95]If I need to stop to compose myself, I will.
[95:37.89]hardcore run, you can just right click.
[95:40.32]Yeah, I mean, I could just pause it.
[95:41.42]I could go back too.
[95:42.25]It's a playlist.
[95:44.02]So it shouldn't be too bad.
[95:50.00]If I loop a video, will it save that throughout every other video or just the video that I'm currently on?
[96:01.58]Right, so I'd have to do it.
[96:03.38]I'd have to set it on every video.
[96:11.70]Alright, well, let's go.
[96:13.13]I'm not worried about it.
[96:14.74]Alright, here we go.
[96:16.77]Coming back.
[96:20.02]Let me actually make sure this audio is fine.
[96:22.34]I guess we can do a test here.
[96:29.88]This needs to change.
[96:35.28]Actually, this needs to be...
[96:36.39]I think I can just do this.
[96:40.73]Whoa.
[96:45.70]There we go.
[96:46.08]Okay.
[96:52.64]Hello, I am back.
[96:55.82]I have returned.
[97:03.34]Alright, so here we go.
[97:09.87]You look different.
[97:11.72]I just, I think I combed my hair.
[97:16.48]Alright, here we go.
[97:18.43]God damn.
[97:24.87]No, not now!
[97:28.86]No, there's a wasp!
[97:31.27]Oh, fuck.
[97:32.34]Not like this.
[97:34.85]Classic.
[97:36.58]God, please, fucking...
[97:41.16]I love how he runs out of the room, by the way.
[97:44.69]Hold on, go back.
[97:47.32]Goddamn.
[97:53.80]No, not now.
[97:57.77]No, there's a wasp.
[98:00.34]Oh, fuck.
[98:01.24]Not like this.
[98:04.99]I've seen this quite a few times.
[98:10.05]Arnold Stevens, please get the ball rolling on what kind of poem spells out a word with each line.
[98:14.40]I've been waiting to find out what this one is all day.
[98:17.83]Uh, it could be, you know... Alright, that was a good place for us to start.
[98:21.38]We'll explore this topic in more depth next time.
[98:23.83]Okay, you got it, Mrs. Bryant.

[98:49.88]I didn't do anything.
[98:51.70]I didn't do anything.
[98:52.97]My man caught me.
[98:54.41]Rumor crap, they activated the bomb.
[98:58.12]Why is there always wrestling moves in these games?

[99:40.85]Okay.
[99:42.28]I'm going to turn autoplay off.
[99:43.87]Where is it?
[99:46.44]Because I can just scroll through, right?
[99:55.67]Where's autoplay?
[100:00.60]Playlist is different.
[100:01.62]What do you mean?
[100:04.33]It should be in the play.
[100:05.85]Oh, it's in the playlist.
[100:13.53]I don't see it here.
[100:15.68]I don't want to get spoiled.
[100:19.30]Yeah.
[100:19.48]Isn't there usually like a little button underneath of the viewer?
[100:24.61]Usually there's a little like, yeah, bottom right of the player.
[100:28.03]I don't see it.
[100:35.49]Maybe it doesn't work if you're on a playlist.
[100:37.36]Playlist, you can't do it in a playlist.
[100:39.15]Not for playlist.
[100:39.84]Okay, well, whatever.

[101:12.28]Dear Lord, I wonder about.
[101:13.88]Benjamin Franklin wonder why did he have to go fly that kite?
[101:20.67]We have electricity.
[101:24.04]I wonder why Benjamin Franklin invented the light It was the year 1750 he flew that kite He was drunk off of Hennessy
[101:32.75]acting foolish.
[101:34.08]He was dumb for that.
[101:35.48]He could have got electrocuted.
[101:38.13]Some say electricity is evil.
[101:40.70]And I say it's the reason why John Lennon left the Beatles.
[101:44.52]I'm not down with OPP.
[101:46.45]I'm down with Benjamin Franklin and PG&E.
[101:50.21]Electricity all the time.
[101:53.22]Screwing the light bulb and turning on the light.
[101:55.97]Light in the day, light in the night.
[101:59.57]Plug in your plug, electricity all the time.
[102:03.85]Dear Lord, I wonder about Benjamin Franklin.

[116:47.48]What about all the illegal drugs you do in your garage?
[116:49.84]Oh, there's no illegal drugs in my garage.
[116:51.47]Oh, yes, there is.
[116:52.23]And there's evidence of it.
[116:54.28]Hello there.
[116:54.70]Hello, darling.
[116:55.12]There are no illegal drugs on my property.
[116:57.05]Hello, sweetheart.
[116:58.58]You know...
[117:00.20]Well, well, well.
[117:01.67]Guess who just got kicked out of Starbucks for, you guessed it, being white.
[117:10.24]Hey gang, Caelid here.
[117:12.20]Glad to see you.
[117:12.93]Enjoyed
[117:14.22]my little video.
[117:17.24]Next time that you order a temporary tattoo online, make sure that you get an actual temporary one and not the kind
[117:24.53]that's waterproof and apparently lasts two weeks.
[117:29.65]If anybody has any advice on what to do, please direct message me.
[117:36.92]I don't know how to get this off my head.
[117:46.91]Doctor!
[117:51.83]Keep it up!
[117:52.86]Medic is spy!
[117:55.07]No!
[117:56.16]We're good.
[118:02.67]Who are you?
[118:04.42]Seymour Smoke, smoke detector.
[118:08.46]The more smoke I see, the more noise I make.
[118:12.41]And I see more smoke coming from that toaster.
[118:20.04]Thanks for warning us, Seymour.
[118:22.32]That's my job.
[118:24.69]I hate smoke.
[118:25.79]It's disgusting.
[118:30.01]It gives me a headache, so whenever I see it or smell it, I make this noise to warn you.
[118:38.08]Because where there's smoke, there may be fire.
[118:41.53]Good tips, Seymour.
[118:43.02]How many smoke detectors do you have in your home?
[118:45.89]Count them.
[118:46.51]Is there one outside your bedroom?
[118:47.99]There should be.
[118:49.24]Tell your parents.
[118:51.52]I say thanks.
[118:57.18]Chicken.
[118:58.34]We'd like to take a moment to announce that all our food keeps blowing up.
[119:04.10]Aw, shit farting on my roommate's door, ha.
[119:10.36]Yeah.
[119:16.40]Did you see it?
[119:18.11]On the left side of the doorframe, barely visible on camera.
[119:21.08]It's classic, I've seen it if I've watched it a million times.
[119:23.27]Slowly creeps into frame.
[119:28.68]Great video
[119:38.76]Okay, let's go.
[119:50.98]Okay.
[120:00.97]Yeah.
[120:06.91]Thank you.
[120:14.87]This almost got me.
[120:16.25]It's not even the video.
[120:24.35]These buckets are filled with grapes.
[120:26.19]What kind of grapes?
[120:28.00]Did somebody submit this last time?
[120:30.18]Actually, I don't think so
[120:40.17]Stop!
[120:44.77]Ow!
[120:47.66]Ow!
[120:48.01]Ow!
[120:48.33]Ow!
[120:48.83]Ow!
[120:49.23]Ow!
[120:49.49]Ow!
[120:49.89]Ow!
[120:51.26]Ow!
[120:51.34]Ow!
[120:51.42]Ow!
[120:51.50]Ow!
[120:52.74]This is one of the first viral ass videos, right?
[120:57.26]No.
[120:57.90]Oh, dear.
[120:58.40]I think she's actually hurt.
[120:59.67]No, I think she is.
[121:01.05]Yeah, she's hurt.
[121:01.48]She took a hard fall off there.
[121:03.58]Boy, gosh, I hope she's okay.
[121:05.63]Okay, we're going to make sure she is.
[121:08.16]We'll try and check on her and get back to you as soon as we can.
[121:10.20]We'll be back right after this.
[121:13.11]When the documents were in place, Buford!
[121:16.03]Buford, you listening?
[121:17.45]Now get this.
[121:18.72]That's when the subcommittee had to reallocate the funds and then.
[121:23.62]It's a good way to test.
[121:25.15]This doesn't look real.
[121:26.27]It's not done.
[121:27.24]It's not even warm yet.
[121:28.58]That's still cold.
[121:29.95]What the fuck, Brett?
[121:31.64]What was that?
[121:32.06]Why did you do that in our kitchen?
[121:33.67]It needs a little more time.
[121:57.76]That was close.
[122:08.56]Why was it so loud?
[122:18.02]It doesn't make any sense!
[122:27.79]Bless my wellness.
[122:37.77]How do you even go back to the play after that?
[122:40.42]I feel like that's...
[122:48.92]Banjo-Kazooie
[122:56.99]Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
[123:07.89].
[123:08.39].
[123:08.75].
[123:14.12]Thank you.
[123:20.44]Ze fare romantik.
[123:31.45]Leroy Merlin.
[123:39.02]It's a very easy situation to operate.
[123:41.27]You just push the buttons in right here on the two sides.
[123:43.68]I feel like I've referenced this video like 50 times.
[123:46.32]That will release it.
[123:47.40]And what?
[123:47.84]Right here.
[123:48.41]push the button and that releases it now it's locked in place now it's locked in place I didn't have a lock before and this is tough it is listen give you an example
[123:59.04]Say you have a, you know, you have to get up on the wall, high ceiling vault.
[124:02.50]Hey, listen, just walk right up.
[124:04.03]And I tell you, it's very safe, it's durable, and it's lightweight.
[124:08.85]Now it's locked in place.
[124:13.90]I don't know how you would ever think that it was locked in place.
[124:18.32]You have to lock it.
[124:19.78]Once you lock it, you're okay.
[124:22.03]But...
[124:23.79]It is very safe to operate.
[124:26.74]Sounds so defeated.
[124:28.13]Continue to call for it.
[124:29.43]All righty.
[124:30.08]Well, Harold, I hope you're okay.
[124:56.21]Another seal.
[124:57.02]This is the theme this time, apparently, yeah.
[125:07.03]I feel like seals would be so much fun to hang out with.
[125:21.89]True, though.
[125:32.24]Oh my god.
[125:39.60]Share just a little bit of blanket.
[125:41.17]I barely have enough as it is.
[125:42.81]This mustn't register on an emotional level.
[125:45.52]First, distract target.
[125:47.45]Then, employ full body twist.
[125:49.64]As expected, she will respond with a burrito roll.
[125:52.29]Quickly establish firm grip.
[125:55.16]Discombobulate.
[125:57.27]Dazed, the blanket will be left unprotected.
[126:01.03]Enjoy maximum comfort.
[126:27.81]What?
[126:30.32]Now at 28 days old, they're ready for a very important date.
[126:35.79]So today's ringing day for the Ashwood kestrels, so I'm gonna head up there and get them down, and we're gonna get some ID rings put on them.
[126:42.24]I don't wear gloves, so I don't damage that guy with feathers.
[126:46.98]But I'm going to be careful.
[126:47.61]Kestrel chicks can be feisty.
[127:03.04]Way too dead.
[127:13.17]Fierce little characters.
[127:21.69]I love that video.
[127:31.31]Suck your dad's.
[127:33.51]It's mingy and he's fucking mingy.
[127:35.34]Let me light it.
[127:36.83]don't don't blow out happy birthday between a noise and a sound effect most people tend to clap
[127:51.95]Fuck.
[127:58.93]Honestly, it's the abrupt ones that get me sometimes.
[128:05.82]I kind of knew I've had a feeling something weird was gonna happen with the fucking balloon.
[128:11.62]You have the humor of a toddler.
[128:13.82]I abrupt changes, abrupt change.
[128:16.78]That is a toddler.
[128:18.32]Abrupt changes that I'm not prepared for make me laugh or cry.
[128:25.46]That person who submitted it was Philip.
[128:30.06]The name was Philip underscore Maybutt.
[128:34.06]Philip underscore Maybutt.
[128:36.73]So thank you.
[128:39.69]We'll get in touch.
[128:42.32]Hold on.
[128:42.78]Oh, no.
[128:45.07]Let me light it.
[128:45.59]Don't blow it out.
[128:48.10]Happy birthday to you, darling.
[128:55.70]So it's just so it's an extreme change.
[129:00.83]The air that comes up.
[129:08.14]and a sound effect.
[129:09.72]Most people tend to classify both of them together, but a noise is different in that it's nondescript.
[129:14.13]You can't identify it.
[129:16.03]That's a noise.
[129:17.11]A sound effect is dissuadable.
[129:20.02]You know what those are.
[129:20.84]You can identify them.
[129:32.34]Stans diligently trained his voice since he was six years old.
[129:36.03]Now he can imitate just about anything and anyone.
[129:39.82]You can be a siren.
[129:42.19]Yes, I'm the loudest man in the world to be in the Guinness Book of Records.
[129:44.68]I do 125 dB with this voice alone.
[129:53.70]Holy shit, that was crazy!
[130:03.40]This humble Legion soldier is at your service.
[130:06.50]How can I help a fellow citizen of the Empire?
[130:16.84]There's evil afoot, citizen.
[130:20.49]If you run into trouble, come find me.
[130:28.48]Uh-oh.
[130:30.61]Lock in, lock in.
[130:32.85]Focus.
[131:23.83]That was close.
[131:26.57]That was really close.
[131:30.21]The last, and remember, this is what gets me every time.
[131:33.78]And it, I'm good.
[131:36.78]I'm good.
[131:45.75]That's one of the best videos on the internet.
[132:18.22]these two why why are they so mad at each other
[132:28.70]Every time I watch a fucking dumb video like this,
[132:34.23]It's like he thinks, like this cat thinks that this cat did all this?
[132:39.56]Like, bro, like...
[132:41.29]What'd you do all that for?
[132:43.31]You did all this.
[132:47.01]Oh.
[132:47.77]Oh my god.
[132:50.97]Yeah, why?
[132:52.78]Why did he get so angry at this other cat?
[132:55.63]These poor cats.
[132:56.59]It's so sad, but it's just, it's total chaos.
[133:03.98]How did this cat get up that high?
[133:09.10]Why did you go there?
[133:13.97]Like you got mad air.
[133:20.94]That's dunking air.
[133:25.28]And then, oh, I hope that one's okay.
[133:31.22]He starts attacking him.
[133:33.61]Now he's pissed at everybody.
[133:38.27]It's so sad.
[133:39.50]It's so sad.
[133:41.70]Okay.
[133:45.49]Oh, poor cats.
[133:46.82]Oh, they're all okay.
[133:48.96]That was Kevin underscore Zephyr.
[133:54.68]Oh, my goodness.
[133:58.25]Cats are hilarious.
[134:19.13]Savage beauty.
[134:21.20]Look at that powerful body.
[134:23.39]Strength, grace, magnificent form.
[134:27.60]How does the tiger manage to keep himself at the peak of physical fitness for his entire life?
[134:34.56]He doesn't lift weights, work machines,
[134:37.32]perform calisthenics or aerobics, and he doesn't jog, yet he can tear the head off a man.
[134:43.66]His power comes from his own exercise system.
[134:47.41]far different from man's and also far superior.
[134:52.82]It is the ultimate exercise system.
[134:55.04]which I call Tiger Moves.
[135:03.61]Who put this song on?
[135:05.44]Yo, these guys are my favorite.
[135:07.04]You gotta put on the live version from 98.
[135:18.36]Bozo is the most overrated clown.
[135:21.21]Not having Bozo in your top five is insane.
[135:23.57]Oh, that is bull.
[135:24.80]Oh, shit.
[135:25.58]I matched with this mime on Tinder.
[135:26.80]I'm carrying the whole conversation.
[135:28.35]Well, one of us is gonna have to change.
[135:30.88]We look ridiculous.
[135:34.07]Hey!
[135:35.40]Can you guys shut the fuck up?
[135:36.94]I'm trying to study.
[135:40.40]Sorry, I'm sorry.

[135:44.81]Oh, yo, guys.

[136:01.42]Well he went this way.
[136:03.11]And then he went that way.
[136:06.00]And then he went this way.
[136:08.23]And then I go this way.
[136:10.79]And then I go that way.
[136:11.93]Oh, God.
[136:12.66]Oh, my God.
[136:17.62]I'm sorry.

[138:28.49]I'm sitting right here with a straight face.
[138:37.09]Scary moments caught on tape.

[140:59.13]You got to be careful with these.
[141:00.14]Alright.
[141:00.38]Oh, my God.
[141:01.22]Wait, wait.
[141:01.62]What was it?

[141:08.94]I'm going to turn this down a little because I feel like it's going to we're going to get an explosion.
[141:13.61]You gotta be kidding.
[141:14.63]And I am permanently traumatized by explosions.
[141:17.00]What?
[141:17.68]What was that?

[142:19.71]I remember the poke thing, and I internally chuckled to myself, like, oh yeah, I remember, that's funny that they put that there in that edit, the editing, okay.
[142:28.11]And then I chuckled out loud and I forgot I was like doing a challenge.
[142:37.68]Alright, here we go.
[142:39.41]Turn it back up.

[142:59.29]So, I admit, I kinda got a little angry.
[143:02.99]Did you kill him?
[143:04.60]What kind of fucking animal do you take me for?
[143:07.13]No, I didn't kill him.

[143:18.00]Alright, hold off from that at least until I get back.
[143:34.50]more.
[143:52.08]That's actually pretty impressive.
[143:55.86]Okay, anybody that's ever done that before, if you try to do two or three of those in a row, it just doesn't, you just can't.
[144:00.32]That's crazy.
[144:03.72]That was awesome.
[144:05.84]That's it, it's time to sail, Marmok, to the people, the vacation is over.
[144:11.46]Oh, fuck, Glena!
[144:12.92]What the fuck are you holding your head for?
[144:28.20]We'll be right back.
[144:33.92]Okay.
[144:34.70]This is a classic video.
[144:36.16]I gotta get the intoxicated pig.
[144:41.78]Look where I poured that.
[144:43.97]My eyes shut right there.
[144:45.48]Look at this pig.
[144:48.09]I always think right here, he looks like Otto sleeping.
[144:51.51]This is what Otto looks like when he's asleep.
[144:54.71]Never seen a damn pig.
[144:56.12]Yeah, that one there's fine.
[145:00.24]They all look like Otto.
[145:10.99]Whoa, ho, ho, shit the bed on my head.
[145:14.58]Oh, come here, girl.
[145:20.32]Holy hell, boy.
[145:22.56]I didn't mean to do that.
[145:25.87]okay okay okay wait a minute there we go wait a minute alright that must have been rough
[145:41.87]Shut up, dogs.
[145:46.42]Damn, I have to spend the rest of the night watching this one.
[145:54.63]Shut up, guys.
[145:57.31]And this is Gregorio, a regular customer of the restaurant who has smoked 16 cigars a day since age 12.
[146:07.61]Next May, he'll be 14 years old.
[146:13.80]Okay, that one, just the first part of that, just the first part is outrageous to me.
[146:26.08]If you smoke even 10 cigars a day, they take a lot, a cigar is a long time, even 10.
[146:37.29]That's every second of almost every day.
[146:42.55]Turn the volume back up.
[146:44.86]Oops.
[146:49.91]Have we seen this before?
[146:54.22]He thinks every video is real.
[146:55.86]Well, I mean, that news story had to be, somebody had to make a news story about somebody, even if it was audio from a different place.
[147:07.43]And what inquiry do you have for the King today?
[147:11.04]I'm telling you, these are facts.
[147:13.81]They're not even opinions.
[147:14.65]This is not even an opinion.
[147:16.32]Dog food is delicious.
[147:18.38]It's like every time I take a bite of it, it just transports me.
[147:21.03]Mm-hmm.
[147:21.87]It's like the best thing I've ever had in my whole life.
[147:23.76]Another bite.
[147:24.26]I lick that plate clean like a fucking dog.
[147:27.04]Like a can of just fucking, just like beef dog food.
[147:31.63]Slay him.
[147:33.13]Father?
[147:33.60]I didn't say that.
[147:34.28]Father, I think he should live.
[147:35.42]I didn't say that.
[147:36.91]I think he should die.
[147:39.05]Like, you've got, like, dog food?
[147:46.54]Trader Joe's butter chicken, right?
[147:48.84]That's like the scale of how things taste.
[147:50.38]Why did I say that?
[147:51.33]I think you should feed him to the lions.
[147:54.05]There had to be a reason.
[147:54.92]What the fuck is going on?
[148:00.48]Interesting.
[148:01.41]I'm not even gonna defend what just happened.
[148:03.86]That's just the way it is.
[148:05.39]It's like my favorite fucking food item ever.
[148:07.32]like that's kind of that's alright I'm alright with that did you laugh out of context but where's it from alright then we're good
[148:13.80]Undertaker, get in here right now, young man!
[148:22.66]Undertaker, does this look like a finished plate to you?
[148:27.28]No, Dad.
[148:28.50]That's right.
[148:30.03]You didn't eat your cucumber.
[148:33.20]Dad, I just want to play Elden Ring.
[148:35.10]Come on.
[148:35.74]No.
[148:40.24]It's a good Paul Bearer impression.
[148:42.05]Dad, I'm 59.
[148:45.54]You only ever do this with me.
[148:47.18]You never do it with Kane.
[148:48.69]Kane is the mayor of Knox County, Tennessee!
[148:52.58]That's real, by the way.
[148:53.40]I don't make boys who apply this!
[148:55.53]themselves eat their vegetables.
[148:57.80]You always gotta bring that up, huh, Dad?
[148:59.85]Undertaker as your biological father!
[149:03.80]Somehow, you're not leaving until you eat the cucumber.
[149:09.73]Oh, yes.
[149:13.42]I'm running away from home.
[149:19.80]Fuck!
[149:20.38]Can I be your son now?
[149:21.57]No!
[149:22.13]Can Mr. Socko?
[149:23.24]Yeah!
[149:23.59]I am honored.
[149:26.01]Alright guys, let's talk about how to catch these bass in this pond when it's frozen over like this.
[149:31.27]Personally, I like to throw a topwater frog because it seems to keep the same action, maybe just a little bit faster.
[149:37.19]My crankbaits with the build baits don't really tend to do very well like this, but if I get a big enough fish to break through the ice, this may actually work.
[149:44.38]But let's just say you wanted to fish panfish.
[149:47.20]I've got my pan fish rod.
[149:48.45]I want to fish this little red worm down in there, but you know, we live in the South and we don't have drills for ice.
[149:54.01]So what we do is we just bring our shotguns out here.
[149:57.46]There, I got a nice little hole and you just dropped that worm right down in there.
[150:00.71]Jesus.
[150:03.58]Oh, I think I got a bite right there.
[150:07.67]Fuck you, Baltimore!
[150:09.08]If you're dumb enough to buy a new car this weekend, you're a big enough schmuck to come to Big Bill Hell's Cars!
[150:14.18]Bad deals!
[150:14.75]Cars that break down!
[150:15.55]If you think you're gonna find a bargain at Big Bill, you can kiss my ass.
[150:19.58]It's our belief that you're such a stupid motherfucker.
[150:21.99]You'll fall for this bullshit.
[150:23.23]Guaranteed.
[150:23.94]If you find a better deal, shove it up
[150:25.54]Shut up your ass.
[150:29.28]I love that phrase.
[150:34.54]Take a hike to Big Bill Hell, home of Challenge Pissing.
[150:38.57]That's right, Challenge Pissing.
[150:39.95]How does it work?
[150:40.67]If you can piss six feet in the air straight up and not get wet, you get no down payment.
[150:44.53]I feel like I could do that.
[150:50.85]Fuck off.
[150:51.36]Hurry up, asshole.
[150:52.28]This event ends the minute after you write us a check.
[150:54.75]And it better not, Bob, so you're a dead man.
[150:56.30]Motherfuckers.
[150:56.93]Go to hell.
[150:57.69]Big Bill Hell's cars.
[150:58.82]All the worst filthiest.
[150:59.80]And exclusive home of the meanest sons of bitches in the state of Maryland.
[151:03.20]Guaranteed.
[151:07.64]Hey, Mario, that big old 500-pound sumbitch Bowser just took the damn princess and used all his star power to put everybody in paintings.
[151:17.63]Now I need you to take your ass inside those paintings and recover the stars with a little bit of jumping wood.
[151:25.53]A little bit of punching, what?
[151:28.37]And a little bit of ass whooping, what?
[151:31.81]To save Princess Peach.
[151:34.40]And that's the bottom line.
[151:36.55]Cause Stone Toad said so.
[151:40.70]Alright, I...
[151:43.05]I love how it's just a PNG that doesn't move.
[151:48.42]That's what was going to get me more than anything else.
[151:51.63]But that was a good one.
[151:54.47]jedi horse from burberry what is the essence of a hero power this real speed
[152:05.64]A horse embodies all of these qualities.
[152:11.29]That is why I trade with horses.
[152:15.50]I must be stronger than the horse.
[152:17.51]Why did he have a lightsaber?
[152:18.74]Faster than the horse.
[152:21.10]more beautiful than the horse.
[152:24.56]But it's not enough to merely train with horses.
[152:27.60]I must join it in the Jedi ocean where the force will surround us penetrate us
[152:35.26]Yeah, I know it's Adam Driver, and I know he's the lights... To become a hero, I must first become...
[152:41.92]Burberry?
[152:43.83]It's a joke ad.
[152:44.47]Okay, it's a joke ad.
[152:47.98]Okay, alright.
[152:48.65]I was like, what the fuck is going on?
[152:50.95]We're getting a slight increase in the number of doses that we'll be getting to the state.
[153:00.76]We're getting a slight increase in the number of doses that we'll be getting.
[153:13.18]No, I didn't.
[153:16.45]It wasn't, it was a cough.
[153:18.12]It wasn't even, this is, this is fake news.
[153:21.03]This is fake.
[153:22.41]She, she goes like this.
[153:23.21]She goes like.
[153:28.08]Hold on, let's verify this information.
[153:48.78]Why did I watch it four fucking times?
[153:52.50]I shouldn't have even laughed at this.
[153:54.31]I just, whatever.
[153:59.48]It's a cough.
[154:00.35]That's a cough, right?
[154:04.61]We're getting a...

[154:13.48]Sometimes I do that too.
[154:15.23]Whatever.
[154:17.86]That is...
[154:20.27]That was Na Mara.
[154:22.87]Na Mara.
[154:25.26]Get a game of your choice for 30 minutes.
[154:31.33]and the number of doses that we'll be getting to the state.
[154:47.88]Guys, how do I land?
[154:58.85]Scientists were able to mimic Nessie Amun's voice by recreating his mouth and vocal cords with a 3D printer.
[155:06.41]It allowed them to produce a single sound.
[155:10.99]I was preparing for it.
[156:09.74]What is this even from?
[156:11.57]Did you make... Did somebody make this in Blender just to do that?
[156:14.81]Because of this fucking stream?
[156:21.03]I fucking hate how annoying I am.
[156:26.95]You had to lock it.
[156:27.76]I tried to lock in dude.
[156:29.19]It was, it was the fact that it happened like six or seven times.
[156:38.21]You're never beaten those alley.
[156:39.27]I look.
[156:44.49]It was the game clam.
[156:49.57]In my brain, the reason why I left is it, to me, it felt like somebody here in this community
[156:57.72]made that on purpose.
[157:00.58]That's all I could think of was this motherfucker in the chat right now made this because all we talk about is, oh, car crashes.
[157:07.14]He thinks they're so funny.

[157:19.81]Iron234, congratulations.
[157:28.31]I shouldn't have even laughed at this.
[157:30.02]I can't, I'm actually annoyed.
[157:31.51]So it's gotta be four and three.
[157:36.02]Okay, any questions before I go on from here?
[157:49.72]Great.

[157:57.62]That's a classic.
[157:59.43]Patrick, did you bring enough for the whole class?

[159:10.91]A go-kart is a car.
[159:12.28]It's not a car.
[159:13.44]A go-kart is a little pretend car.

[186:45.69]And then nine.
[186:48.73]And then...
[186:51.66]And the best feature of the Synco Phone, you cannot receive calls with it.
[186:55.66]You can only make calls.
[186:57.70]You'll never be bothered again at work, your leisure time out on the golf course or at the beach.

[194:07.77]When will you wear wigs?
[194:28.17]Blyat!
[194:36.59]Since pilots couldn't see out of the plane because of angled landing, engineers put together a solution.
[194:42.24]The Concorde featured a droop snoot.
[194:44.35]Droop snoot?
[194:45.80]Yeah, the snoot would droop.
[194:47.27]The snoot drooped.
[194:52.48]Dude.
[194:59.77]Hello.
[195:00.13]Hello, I would.
[195:02.27]Like to modify this stuffed animal and connect a guitar to it.
[195:05.51]I would.
[195:06.83]I'd like to modify this stuffed animal and connect a guitar to it.
[195:11.10]I would.
[195:11.54]I'd like to make some sounds right away.
[195:14.73]What is going on?
[195:28.93]That's the end.
[195:29.57]I made it to the end.
[195:40.53]Okay, I think that's it I think is is there is there any more?
[195:55.27]There should be three more.
[195:57.00]Oh, okay.
[195:58.79]Yeah, can you manually link them?
[196:00.62]There's three more apparently.
[196:08.42]Oh, okay.
[196:11.10]Oh, there are three more.
[196:12.79]You're right.
[196:13.51]You're right.
[196:13.85]You're right.
[196:14.14]I have them manually.
[196:14.90]I forgot I have the manual here.
[196:16.54]I should have them here.
[196:18.49]Alright, here we go.
[196:19.36]Here's this one.
[196:52.21]This is from Driver?
[196:53.19]What I love about Driver, this can happen in Driver?
[197:04.01]You have to play.
[197:04.69]Didn't I?
[197:05.03]No, I did play this.
[197:06.27]I couldn't get through the tutorial.
[197:10.91]This is the game that I couldn't beat the tutorial on, right?
[197:15.31]Okay, here's this one.
[197:23.21]Ah, Raymond, this dog has no license and is clearly in violation of the leash law.
[197:27.69]Call the pound.
[197:29.02]I already did, sir.
[197:30.34]The truck is waiting outside.
[197:33.12]Get out of my way!
[197:35.99]Grab that dog!
[197:37.88]Excuse me, ma'am!
[197:49.47]Oh, boy.
[198:04.60]Good.
[198:07.42]Very good.
[198:10.47]Alright, this will be the last one.
[198:14.34]This is called the Three Stooges Flying Pineapple DVD Rip.
[198:21.89]Zit.
[198:24.50]Santa Maria... ...Kaiser!
[198:33.78]What you tried to make for me?
[198:42.36]A fruit salad?
[198:44.06]That was a real pratfall.
[198:54.07]You can't call me that and get away with it.
[198:56.24]Moron!
[199:02.71]Right.
[199:08.41]Hotel Mario, all cutscenes.
[199:12.25]Alright.
[199:13.87]That's it for that.
[199:16.49]It only took us about three hours to get through.
[199:19.02]But I figured it was going to be at least two hours, like somewhere between an hour and a half to three hours.
[199:23.59]So we're on pace.
[199:25.77]So that means I laughed how many 16 times, uh, 16 out of.
[199:34.48]Like 230 videos?
[199:37.27]That's pretty good numbers.
[199:39.56]So that means that all 16 of you, I'm going to play a game that you want me to play for 30 minutes.
[199:44.56]And if you do the math there, that is eight hours of content that is going to be strictly your choice.
[199:57.46]Also, that also means that there's going to be 12 new emotes.
[200:05.56]We're finally going to have new emotes on this channel.
[200:12.35]If what you submitted, if I laughed at it, again, we have everybody's username that submitted it.
[200:20.57]You got, let's call it five days to get back to the mods here.
[200:28.09]That was a lot of fun.
[200:29.15]There was some good ones in there.
[200:32.19]Uh, I think I locked in pretty well, but there were at least two dozen great ones.
[200:39.79]I still, I cannot believe that that workplace insurance video was out fucking rageous.
[200:45.93]Outrageous.
[200:49.12]Alright, so now it's been about three hours.
[200:52.83]I figured it'd be about a five plus hour stream, so we're good.
[200:57.13]I'm going to make
[201:00.02]I'm gonna mess with some clay.
[201:02.39]Another stream that I promised to do on Christmas, we're doing it.
[201:05.94]I'm gonna take a five minute break.
[201:07.62]So if you were only here for the You Laugh, You Lose,
[201:10.94]Thanks for coming.
[201:12.30]If you want to stick around and watch me play with clay, then let me preface this by saying I'm not
[201:20.52]I'm not very good at this, but art is subjective, right?
[201:24.70]We can all agree with that.
[201:27.16]So I'm going to make a couple of monsters or something.
[201:29.51]Maybe I might just make a couple of balls and just like squish them.
[201:32.93]We'll see.
[201:34.28]But yeah.
[201:35.85]I'm going to go, I'm going to go sleep.
[201:37.13]We'll have a good sleep.
[201:40.05]Alright, let's freaking go.
[201:43.02]I'll be back in like five minutes.
[201:44.54]I've got to move this table behind me too, so I'll be back in a little bit.
[201:48.20]See you later.
[201:51.44]See you in a minute.
[204:59.34]Hello, I'm not back.
[205:01.51]I just wanted to say that auto needs a little bit of attention.
[205:05.20]So I'm going to help out auto.
[205:07.29]And maybe like another five minutes or so.
[205:10.88]I'll be right back.
[205:13.11]I will see you soon.
